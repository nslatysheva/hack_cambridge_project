DURING THE THREE MONTHS THAT HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN I HAVE CHECKED THOSE FACTS AGAIN IN THE LIGHT OF CURRENT EVENTS AND LATER ACKNOWLEDGE AND WERE IT NOT THAT FOREIGN EARS LISTEN TO ALL THAT IS SAID HERE OR IF WE WERE IN SECRET SESSION I WOULD REPEAT MY STATEMENT HERE AND EVEN IF ONLY ONE HALF WERE TRUE I AM SURE THE HOUSE WOULD CONSIDER THAT A VERY GRAVE STATE OF EMERGENCY EXISTED AND ALSO I REGRET TO SAY A STATE OF THINGS FROM WHICH A CERTAIN SUSPICION OF MISMANAGEMENT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED I AM NOT GOING INTO ANY OF THOSE DETAILS I MAKE IT A RULE AS FAR AS I POSSIBLY CAN TO SAY NOTHING IN THIS HOUSE UPON MATTERS WHICH AM NOT SURE ARE ALREADY KNOWN TO THE GENERAL STAFFS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES BUT THERE IS ONE STATEMENT OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE WHICH THE MINISTER FOR THE CO ORDINATION OF DEFENCE MADE IN HIS SPEECH ON TUESDAY HE SAID THE PROCESS OF BUILDING UP SQUADRONS AND FORMING NEW TRAINING UNITS AND SKELETON SQUADRONS IS FAMILIAR TO EVERYBODY CONNECTED WITH THE AIR FORCE THE NUMBER OF SQUADRONS IN PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME TODAY IS EIGHTY AND THAT FIGURE INCLUDES SIXTEEN AUXILIARY SQUADRONS BUT EXCLUDES THE FLEET AIR ARM AND OF COURSE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE SQUADRONS ABROAD FROM THAT FIGURE AND THE RESERVATIONS BY WHICH IT WAS PREFACED IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE HOUSE AND ALSO FOR FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO DEDUCE PRETTY ACCURATELY THE PROGRESS OF OUR AIR FORCE EXPANSION I FEEL THEREFORE AT LIBERTY TO COMMENT ON IT PARLIAMENT WAS PROMISED A TOTAL OF SEVENTY ONE NEW SQUADRONS MAKING A TOTAL OF 124 SQUADRONS IN THE HOME DEFENCE FORCE BY 31 MARCH 1937 THIS WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE MINIMUM COMPATIBLE WITH OUR SAFETY AT THE END OF THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR OUR STRENGTH WAS FIFTY THREE SQUADRONS INCLUDING AUXILIARY SQUADRONS THEREFORE IN THE THIRTY TWO WEEKS WHICH HAVE PASSED SINCE THE FINANCIAL YEAR BEGAN WE HAVE ADDED TWENTY EIGHT SQUADRONS THAT IS TO SAY LESS THAN ONE NEW SQUADRON EACH WEEK IN ORDER TO MAKE THE PROGRESS WHICH PARLIAMENT WAS PROMISED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE PROGRAMME WHICH WAS PUT FORWARD AS THE MINIMUM WE SHALL HAVE TO ADD FORTY THREE SQUADRONS IN THE REMAINING TWENTY WEEKS OR OVER TWO SQUADRONS A WEEK THE RATE AT WHICH NEW SQUADRONS WILL HAVE TO BE FORMED FROM NOW TILL THE END OF MARCH WILL HAVE TO BE NEARLY THREE TIMES AS FAST AS HITHERTO I DO NOT PROPOSE TO ANALYSE THE COMPOSITION OF THE EIGHTY SQUADRONS WE NOW HAVE BUT THE MINISTER IN HIS SPEECH USED A SUGGESTIVE EXPRESSION 'SKELETON SQUADRONS' APPLYING AT LEAST TO A PORTION OF THEM BUT EVEN IF EVERY ONE OF THE EIGHTY SQUADRONS HAD AN AVERAGE STRENGTH OF TWELVE AEROPLANES EACH FITTED WITH WAR EQUIPMENT AND THE RESERVES UPON WHICH MY RIGHT HON FRIEND DWELT WE SHOULD ONLY HAVE A TOTAL OF 960 FIRST LINE HOME DEFENCE AIRCRAFT WHAT IS THE COMPARABLE GERMAN STRENGTH I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE AN ESTIMATE AND SAY THAT THE GERMANS HAVE NOT GOT MORE THAN A CERTAIN NUMBER BUT I WILL TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO SAY THAT THEY MOST CERTAINLY AT THIS MOMENT HAVE NOT GOT LESS THAN A CERTAIN NUMBER MOST CERTAINLY THEY HAVE NOT GOT LESS THAN 1 500 FIRST LINE AEROPLANES COMPRISED IN NOT LESS THAN 130 OR 140 SQUADRONS INCLUDING AUXILIARY SQUADRONS IT MUST ALSO BE REMEMBERED THAT GERMANY HAS NOT GOT IN ITS SQUADRONS ANY MACHINE THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF WHICH IS MORE THAN THREE YEARS OLD IT MUST ALSO BE REMEMBERED THAT GERMANY HAS SPECIALISED IN LONG DISTANCE BOMBING AEROPLANES AND THAT HER PREPONDERANCE IN THAT RESPECT IS FAR GREATER THAN ANY OF THESE FIGURES WOULD SUGGEST WE WERE PROMISED MOST SOLEMNLY BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT AIR PARITY WITH GERMANY WOULD BE MAINTAINED BY THE HOME DEFENCE FORCES AT THE PRESENT TIME PUTTING EVERYTHING AT THE VERY BEST WE ARE UPON THE FIGURES GIVEN BY THE MINISTER FOR THE CO ORDINATION OF DEFENCE ONLY ABOUT TWO THIRDS AS STRONG AS THE GERMAN AIR FORCE ASSUMING THAT I AM NOT VERY MUCH UNDER STATING THEIR PRESENT STRENGTH
HOW THEN DOES THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY SIR SAMUEL HOARE THINK IT RIGHT TO SAY ON THE WHOLE OUR FORECAST OF THE STRENGTH OF OTHER AIR FORCES PROVES TO BE ACCURATE ON THE OTHER HAND OUR OWN ESTIMATES HAVE ALSO PROVED TO BE ACCURATE I AM AUTHORISED TO SAY THAT THE POSITION IS SATISFACTORY' I SIMPLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT PERHAPS THE PRIME MINISTER WILL EXPLAIN THE POSITION I SHOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE HOUSE THAT I HAVE MADE NO REVELATION AFFECTING THIS COUNTRY AND THAT I HAVE INTRODUCED NO NEW FACT IN OUR AIR DEFENCE WHICH DOES NOT ARISE FROM THE FIGURES GIVEN BY THE MINISTER AND FROM THE OFFICIAL ESTIMATES THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED WHAT OUGHT WE TO DO I KNOW OF ONLY ONE WAY IN WHICH THIS MATTER CAN BE CARRIED FURTHER THE HOUSE OUGHT TO DEMAND A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY IT OUGHT TO APPOINT SIX SEVEN OR EIGHT INDEPENDENT MEMBERS RESPONSIBLE EXPERIENCED DISCREET MEMBERS WHO HAVE SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH THESE MATTERS AND ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL PARTIES TO INTERVIEW MINISTERS AND TO FIND OUT WHAT ARE IN FACT THE ANSWERS TO A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THEN TO MAKE A BRIEF REPORT TO THE HOUSE WHETHER OF REASSURANCE OR OF SUGGESTION FOR REMEDYING THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT I THINK IS WHAT ANY PARLIAMENT WORTHY OF THE NAME WOULD DO IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES PARLIAMENTS OF THE PAST DAYS IN WHICH THE GREATNESS OF OUR COUNTRY WAS ABUILDING WOULD NEVER HAVE HESITATED THEY WOULD HAVE FELT THEY COULD NOT DISCHARGE THEIR DUTY TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS IF THEY DID NOT SATISFY THEMSELVES THAT THE SAFETY OF THE COUNTRY WAS BEING EFFECTIVELY MAINTAINED THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT THROUGH ITS COMMITTEES HAS A VERY WIDE DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL DEFENCE AND I AM NOT AWARE THAT THEIR SECRETS LEAK OUT IN ANY EXCEPTIONAL WAY THERE IS NO REASON WHY OUR SECRETS SHOULD LEAK OUT IN ANY EXCEPTIONAL WAY IT IS BECAUSE SO MANY MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT ARE ASSOCIATED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE NATIONAL DEFENCE THAT THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT WERE INDUCED TO SUPPLY SIX YEARS AGO UPWARD OF 163 60 000 000 STERLING TO CONSTRUCT THE MAGINOT LINE OF FORTIFICATIONS WHEN OUR GOVERNMENT WAS ASSURING THEM THAT WARS WERE OVER AND THAT FRANCE MUST NOT LAG BEHIND BRITAIN IN HER DISARMAMENT EVEN NOW I HOPE THAT MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WILL RISE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS OF PARTY DISCIPLINE AND WILL INSIST UPON KNOWING WHERE WE STAND IN A MATTER WHICH AFFECTS OUR LIBERTIES AND OUR LIVES I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND ABOVE ALL THE PRIME MINISTER WHOSE LOAD IS SO HEAVY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED SUCH A SUGGESTION OWING TO PAST NEGLECT IN THE FACE OF THE PLAINEST WARNINGS WE HAVE NOW ENTERED UPON A PERIOD OF DANGER GREATER THAN HAS BEFALLEN BRITAIN SINCE THE U BOAT CAMPAIGN WAS CRUSHED PERHAPS INDEED IT IS A MORE GRIEVOUS PERIOD THAN THAT BECAUSE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST WE WERE POSSESSED OF THE MEANS OF SECURING OURSELVES AND OF DEFEATING THAT CAMPAIGN NOW WE HAVE NO SUCH ASSURANCE THE ERA OF PROCRASTINATION OF HALF MEASURES OF SOOTHING AND BAFFLING EXPEDIENTS OF DELAYS IS COMING TO ITS CLOSE IN ITS PLACE WE ARE ENTERING A PERIOD OF CONSEQUENCES WE HAVE ENTERED A PERIOD IN WHICH FOR MORE THAN A YEAR OR A YEAR AND A HALF THE CONSIDERABLE PREPARATIONS WHICH ARE NOW ON FOOT IN BRITAIN WILL NOT AS THE MINISTER CLEARLY SHOWED YIELD RESULTS WHICH CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN ACTUAL FIGHTING STRENGTH WHILE DURING THIS VERY PERIOD GERMANY MAY WELL REACH THE CULMINATING POINT OF HER GIGANTIC MILITARY PREPARATIONS AND BE FORCED BY FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC STRINGENCY TO CONTEMPLATE A SHARP DECLINE OR PERHAPS SOME OTHER EXIT FROM HER DIFFICULTIES IT IS THIS LAMENTABLE CONJUNCTION OF EVENTS WHICH SEEMS TO PRESENT THE DANGER OF EUROPE IN ITS MOST DISQUIETING FORM WE CANNOT AVOID THIS PERIOD WE ARE IN IT NOW SURELY IF WE CAN ABRIDGE IT BY EVEN A FEW MONTHS IF WE CAN SHORTEN THIS PERIOD WHEN THE
