LAST RESORT OF THE SUM OF ITS OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS LET NO ONE SAY THAT THE PICTURE PRODUCED AS A FIRST IMPRESSION OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION IS THE IMPRESSION OF ITS ACHIEVEMENT AS A WHOLE THIS WHOLE EDIFICE OF CIVILIZATION IS IN ITS FOUNDATIONS AND IN ALL ITS STONES NOTHING ELSE THAN THE RESULT OF THE CREATIVE CAPACITY THE ACHIEVEMENT THE INTELLIGENCE THE INDUSTRY OF INDIVIDUALS IN ITS GREATEST TRIUMPHS IT REPRESENTS THE GREAT CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL GOD FAVORED GENIUSES IN ITS AVERAGE ACCOMPLISHMENT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF MEN OF AVERAGE CAPACITY AND IN ITS SUM DOUBTLESS THE RESULT OF THE USE OF HUMAN LABOR FORCE IN ORDER TO TURN TO ACCOUNT THE CREATIONS OF GENIUS AND OF TALENT SO IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT WHEN THE CAPABLE INTELLIGENCES OF A NATION WHICH ARE ALWAYS IN A MINORITY ARE REGARDED ONLY AS OF THE SAME VALUE AS ALL THE REST THEN GENIUS CAPACITY THE VALUE OF PERSONALITY ARE SLOWLY SUBJECTED TO THE MAJORITY AND THIS PROCESS IS THEN FALSELY NAMED THE RULE OF THE PEOPLE FOR THIS IS NOT RULE OF THE PEOPLE BUT IN REALITY THE RULE OF STUPIDITY OF MEDIOCRITY OF HALF HEARTEDNESS OF COWARDICE OF WEAKNESS AND OF INADEQUACY THUS DEMOCRACY WILL IN PRACTICE LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF A PEOPLE'S TRUE VALUES AND THIS ALSO SERVES TO EXPLAIN HOW IT IS THAT PEOPLES WITH A GREAT PAST FROM THE TIME WHEN THEY SURRENDER THEMSELVES TO THE UNLIMITED DEMOCRATIC RULE OF THE MASSES SLOWLY LOSE THEIR FORMER POSITION FOR THE OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUALS WHICH THEY STILL POSSESS OR WHICH COULD BE PRODUCED IN ALL SPHERES OF LIFE ARE NOW RENDERED PRACTICALLY INEFFECTIVE THROUGH THE OPPRESSION OF MERE NUMBERS AND THUS IN THESE CONDITIONS A PEOPLE WILL GRADUALLY LOSE ITS IMPORTANCE NOT MERELY IN THE CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC SPHERES BUT ALTOGETHER IN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME IT WILL NO LONGER WITHIN THE SETTING OF THE OTHER PEOPLES OF THE WORLD MAINTAIN ITS FORMER VALUE AND TO THIS THERE MUST BE ADDED A THIRD FACTOR NAMELY THE VIEW THAT LIFE IN THIS WORLD AFTER THE DENIAL OF THE VALUE OF PERSONALITY AND OF THE SPECIAL VALUE OF A PEOPLE IS NOT TO BE MAINTAINED THROUGH CONFLICT THAT IS A CONCEPTION WHICH COULD PERHAPS BE DISREGARDED IF IT FIXED ITSELF ONLY IN THE HEADS OF INDIVIDUALS BUT YET HAS APPALLING CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE IT SLOWLY POISONS AN ENTIRE PEOPLE AND IT IS NOT AS IF SUCH GENERAL CHANGES IN MEN'S OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD REMAINED ONLY ON THE SURFACE OR WERE CONFINED TO THEIR EFFECTS ON MEN'S MINDS NO IN COURSE OF TIME THEY EXERCISE A PROFOUND INFLUENCE AND AFFECT ALL EXPRESSIONS OF A PEOPLE'S LIFE I MAY CITE AN EXAMPLE YOU MAINTAIN GENTLEMEN THAT GERMAN BUSINESS LIFE MUST BE CONSTRUCTED ON A BASIS OF PRIVATE PROPERTY NOW SUCH A CONCEPTION AS THAT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY YOU CAN DEFEND ONLY IF IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER IT APPEARS TO HAVE A LOGICAL FOUNDATION THIS CONCEPTION MUST DEDUCE ITS ETHICAL JUSTIFICATION FROM AN INSIGHT INTO THE NECESSITY WHICH NATURE DICTATES IT CANNOT SIMPLY BE UPHELD BY SAYING 'IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO AND THEREFORE IT MUST CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR IN PERIODS OF GREAT UPHEAVALS WITHIN STATES OF MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLES AND CHANGES IN THOUGHT INSTITUTIONS AND SYSTEMS CANNOT REMAIN UNTOUCHED BECAUSE THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN PRESERVED WITHOUT CHANGE IT IS THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF ALL REALLY GREAT REVOLUTIONARY EPOCHS IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND THAT THEY PAY ASTONISHINGLY LITTLE REGARD FOR FORMS WHICH ARE HALLOWED ONLY BY AGE OR WHICH ARE APPARENTLY ONLY SO CONSECRATED IT IS THUS NECESSARY TO GIVE SUCH FOUNDATIONS TO TRADITIONAL FORMS WHICH ARE TO BE PRESERVED THAT THEY CAN BE REGARDED AS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AS LOGICAL AND RIGHT AND THEN I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY CAN BE MORALLY AND ETHICALLY JUSTIFIED ONLY IF I ADMIT THAT MEN'S ACHIEVEMENTS ARE DIFFERENT ONLY ON THAT BASIS CAN I ASSERT SINCE MEN'S ACHIEVEMENTS ARE DIFFERENT THE RESULTS OF THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE ALSO DIFFERENT BUT IF THE RESULTS OF THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE DIFFERENT THEN IT IS REASONABLE TO LEAVE TO MEN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE RESULTS TO A CORRESPONDING DEGREE IT WOULD NOT BE LOGICAL TO ENTRUST THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE RESULT OF AN ACHIEVEMENT WHICH WAS BOUND UP WITH A PERSONALITY EITHER TO THE NEXT BEST BUT LESS CAPABLE PERSON OR TO A COMMUNITY WHICH THROUGH THE MERE FACT THAT IT HAD NOT PERFORMED THE ACHIEVEMENT HAS PROVED THAT IT IS NOT CAPABLE OF ADMINISTERING THE RESULT OF THAT ACHIEVEMENT THUS IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT
IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE FROM THE START IN ALL BRANCHES MEN ARE NOT OF EQUAL VALUE OR OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE AND ONCE THIS IS ADMITTED IT IS MADNESS TO SAY IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE THERE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY DIFFERENCES IN VALUE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE IT IS ABSURD TO BUILD UP ECONOMIC LIFE ON THE CONCEPTIONS OF ACHIEVEMENT OF THE VALUE OF PERSONALITY AND THEREFORE IN PRACTICE ON THE AUTHORITY OF PERSONALITY BUT IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE TO DENY THE AUTHORITY OF PERSONALITY AND TO THRUST INTO ITS PLACE THE LAW OF THE GREATER NUMBER DEMOCRACY IN THAT CASE THERE MUST SLOWLY ARISE A CLEAVAGE BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC AND THE POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW AND TO BRIDGE THAT CLEAVAGE AN ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TO ASSIMILATE THE FORMER TO THE LATTER INDEED THE ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE FOR THIS CLEAVAGE HAS NOT REMAINED BARE PALE THEORY THE CONCEPTION OF THE EQUALITY OF VALUES HAS ALREADY NOT ONLY IN POLITICS BUT IN ECONOMICS ALSO BEEN RAISED TO A SYSTEM AND THAT NOT MERELY IN ABSTRACT THEORY NO THIS ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS ALIVE IN GIGANTIC ORGANIZATIONS AND IT HAS ALREADY TODAY INSPIRED A STATE WHICH RULES OVER IMMENSE AREAS BUT I CANNOT REGARD IT AS POSSIBLE THAT THE LIFE OF A PEOPLE SHOULD IN THE LONG RUN BE BASED UPON TWO FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTIONS IF THE VIEW IS RIGHT THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT THEN IT MUST ALSO BE TRUE THAT THE VALUE OF MEN IN RESPECT OF THE PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN ACHIEVEMENTS IS DIFFERENT IT IS THEN ABSURD TO ALLOW THIS PRINCIPLE TO HOLD GOOD ONLY IN ONE SPHERE THE SPHERE OF ECONOMIC LIFE AND ITS LEADERSHIP AND TO REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ITS VALIDITY IN THE SPHERE OF THE WHOLE LIFE STRUGGLE OF A PEOPLE THE SPHERE OF POLITICS RATHER THE LOGICAL COURSE IS THAT IF I RECOGNIZE WITHOUT QUALIFICATION IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE THE FACT OF SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENTS AS FORMING THE CONDITION OF ALL HIGHER CULTURE THEN IN THE SAME WAY I SHOULD RECOGNIZE SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SPHERE OF POLITICS AND THAT MEANS THAT I AM BOUND TO PUT IN THE FOREFRONT THE AUTHORITY OF PERSONALITY IF ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ASSERTED AND THAT TOO BY THOSE ENGAGED IN BUSINESS THAT IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE SPECIAL CAPACITIES ARE NOT NECESSARY BUT THAT HERE AN ABSOLUTE EQUALITY IN ACHIEVEMENT REIGNS THEN ONE DAY THIS SAME THEORY WILL BE TRANSFERRED FROM POLITICS AND APPLIED TO ECONOMIC LIFE BUT IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE COMMUNISM IS ANALOGOUS TO DEMOCRACY IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE WE FIND OURSELVES TODAY IN A PERIOD IN WHICH THESE TWO FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ARE AT GRIPS IN ALL SPHERES WHICH COME INTO CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER ALREADY THEY ARE INVADING ECONOMICS TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE LIFE IN PRACTICAL ACTIVITY IS FOUNDED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONALITY BUT NOW GRADUALLY IT IS THREATENED BY THE SUPREMACY OF MERE NUMBERS BUT IN THE STATE THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION THE ARMY WHICH CANNOT IN ANY WAY BE DEMOCRATIZED WITHOUT SURRENDERING ITS VERY EXISTENCE BUT IF A WELTANSCHAUUNG CANNOT BE APPLIED TO EVERY SPHERE OF A PEOPLE'S LIFE THAT FACT IN ITSELF IS SUFFICIENT PROOF OF ITS WEAKNESS IN OTHER WORDS THE ARMY CAN EXIST ONLY IF IT MAINTAINS THE ABSOLUTELY UNDEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE OF UNCONDITIONAL AUTHORITY PROCEEDING DOWNWARDS AND ABSOLUTE RESPONSIBILITY PROCEEDING UPWARDS WHILE IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THIS DEMOCRACY MEANS IN PRACTICE COMPLETE DEPENDENCE PROCEEDING DOWNWARDS AND AUTHORITY PROCEEDING UPWARDS BUT THE RESULT IS THAT IN A STATE IN WHICH THE WHOLE POLITICAL LIFE BEGINNING WITH THE PARISH AND ENDING WITH THE REICHSTAG IS BUILT UP ON THE CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY THE ARMY IS BOUND GRADUALLY TO BECOME AN ALIEN BODY AND AN ALIEN BODY WHICH MUST NECESSARILY BE FELT TO BE SUCH IT IS FOR DEMOCRACY AN ALIEN WORLD OF IDEAS AN ALIEN WELTANSCHAUUNG WHICH INSPIRES THE LIFE OF THIS BODY AN INTERNAL CONFLICT BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE AND THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY MUST BE THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE AND THIS CONFLICT WE ARE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING IN GERMANY SO IN THE SAME WAY THE EDUCATION TO PACIFISM MUST OF NECESSITY HAVE ITS EFFECT RIGHT THROUGH LIFE UNTIL IT REACHES THE HUMBLEST INDIVIDUAL LIVES THE CONCEPTION OF PACIFISM IS LOGICAL IF I ONCE ADMIT A GENERAL EQUALITY AMONGST PEOPLES AND HUMAN BEINGS FOR IN THAT CASE WHAT SENSE IS THERE IN CONFLICT THE CONCEPTION OF PACIFISM TRANSLATED INTO PRACTICE AND APPLIED TO ALL SPHERES MUST GRADUALLY LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COMPETITIVE INSTINCT TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE AMBITION FOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT
I CANNOT SAY IN POLITICS WE WILL BE PACIFISTS WE REJECT THE IDEA OF THE NECESSITY FOR LIFE TO SAFEGUARD ITSELF THROUGH CONFLICT BUT IN ECONOMICS WE WANT TO REMAIN KEENLY COMPETITIVE IF I REJECT THE IDEA OF CONFLICT AS SUCH IT IS OF NO IMPORTANCE THAT FOR THE TIME BEING THAT IDEA IS STILL APPLIED IN SOME SINGLE SPHERES IN THE LAST RESORT POLITICAL DECISIONS ARE DECISIVE AND DETERMINE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SINGLE SPHERE TO SUM UP THE ARGUMENT I SEE TWO DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED PRINCIPLES THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY WHICH WHEREVER IT IS ALLOWED PRACTICAL EFFECT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF DESTRUCTION AND THE PRINCIPLE OF THE AUTHORITY OF PERSONALITY WHICH I WOULD CALL THE PRINCIPLE OF ACHIEVEMENT BECAUSE WHATEVER MAN IN THE PAST HAS ACHIEVED ALL HUMAN CIVILIZATIONS IS CONCEIVABLE ONLY IF THE SUPREMACY OF THIS PRINCIPLE IS ADMITTED THE WORTH OF A PEOPLE THE CHARACTER OF ITS INTERNAL ORGANIZATION THROUGH WHICH THIS WORTH OF A PEOPLE MAY PRODUCE ITS EFFECT AND THE CHARACTER OF A PEOPLE'S EDUCATION THESE ARE THE STARTING POINTS FOR POLITICAL ACTION THESE ARE THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THAT ACTION THAT THE EVIDENCES OF A CRISIS SHOULD TODAY SPREAD OVER ALMOST THE ENTIRE WORLD IS COMPREHENSIBLE WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THAT THE WORLD HAS BEEN OPENED UP AND MUTUAL RELATIONS HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED TO AN EXTENT WHICH FIFTY EIGHTY OR A HUNDRED YEARS AGO APPEARED SCARCELY POSSIBLE AND YET DESPITE THIS FACT ONE MUST NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH A STATE OF AFFAIRS IS CONCEIVABLE ONLY NOW IN THE YEAR 1932 NO SIMILAR CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED MORE THAN ONCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD ALWAYS WHEN RELATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLES PRODUCED CONDITIONS SUCH AS THESE THE MALADY AFFECTING THESE PEOPLES WAS BOUND TO SPREAD AND TO INFLUENCE THE POSITION OF ALL IT IS OF COURSE EASY TO SAY WE PREFER TO WAIT UNTIL THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE GENERAL POSITION BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE POSITION WHICH FACES YOU TODAY IS NOT THE CONSEQUENCE OF A REVELATION OF GOD'S WILL BUT THE RESULT OF HUMAN WEAKNESSES OF HUMAN MISTAKES OF MEN'S FALSE JUDGMENTS IT IS BUT NATURAL THAT THERE MUST FIRST BE A CHANGE IN THESE CAUSES THAT MEN MUST FIRST BE INWARDLY TRANSFORMED BEFORE ONE CAN COUNT ON ANY ALTERATION IN THE POSITION THAT CONCLUSION IS FORCED UPON US IF WE LOOK AT THE WORLD TODAY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF NATIONS WHICH THROUGH THEIR INBORN OUTSTANDING WORTH HAVE FASHIONED FOR THEMSELVES A MODE OF LIFE WHICH STANDS IN NO RELATION TO THE LIFE SPACE THE LEBENSRAUM WHICH IN THEIR THICKLY POPULATED SETTLEMENTS THEY INHABIT WE HAVE THE SO CALLED WHITE RACE WHICH SINCE THE COLLAPSE OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATION IN THE COURSE OF SOME THOUSAND YEARS HAS CREATED FOR ITSELF A PRIVILEGED POSITION IN THE WORLD BUT I AM QUITE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THIS PRIVILEGED POSITION THIS ECONOMIC SUPREMACY OF THE WHITE RACE OVER THE REST OF THE WORLD IF I DO NOT BRING IT INTO CLOSE CONNECTION WITH A POLITICAL CONCEPTION OF SUPREMACY WHICH HAS BEEN PECULIAR TO THE WHITE RACE FOR MANY CENTURIES AND HAS BEEN REGARDED AS IN THE NATURE OF THINGS THIS CONCEPTION IT HAS MAINTAINED IN ITS DEALINGS WITH OTHER PEOPLES TAKE ANY SINGLE AREA YOU LIKE TAKE FOR EXAMPLE INDIA ENGLAND DID NOT CONQUER INDIA BY THE WAY OF JUSTICE AND OF LAW SHE CONQUERED INDIA WITHOUT REGARD TO THE WISHES TO THE VIEWS OF THE NATIVES OR TO THEIR FORMULATIONS OF JUSTICE AND WHEN NECESSARY SHE HAS UPHELD THIS SUPREMACY WITH THE MOST BRUTAL RUTHLESSNESS JUST IN THE SAME WAY CORTEZ OR PIZARRO ANNEXED CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE NORTHERN STATES OF SOUTH AMERICA NOT ON THE BASIS OF ANY CLAIM OF RIGHT BUT FROM THE ABSOLUTE INBORN FEELING OF THE SUPERIORITY OF THE WHITE RACE THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT IS JUST AS LITTLE THE CONSEQUENCE OF ANY CLAIM OF SUPERIOR RIGHT IN ANY DEMOCRATIC OR INTERNATIONAL SENSE IT WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF A CONSCIOUSNESS OF RIGHT WHICH WAS ROOTED SOLELY IN THE CONVICTION OF THE SUPERIORITY AND THEREFORE OF THE RIGHT OF THE WHITE RACE IF I THINK AWAY THIS ATTITUDE OF MIND WHICH IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES HAS WON THE WORLD FOR THE WHITE RACE THEN THE DESTINY OF THIS RACE WOULD IN FACT HAVE BEEN NO DIFFERENT FROM THAT SAY OF THE CHINESE AN IMMENSELY CONGESTED MASS OF HUMAN BEINGS CROWDED UPON AN EXTRAORDINARILY NARROW TERRITORY AN OVER POPULATION WITH ALL ITS UNAVOIDABLE CONSEQUENCES IF FATE ALLOWED THE WHITE RACE TO TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE THIS WHITE RACE WAS CONVINCED THAT IT HAD THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE THE REST OF THE WORLD IT MATTERS NOT WHAT SUPERFICIAL DISGUISES IN INDIVIDUAL CASES THIS RIGHT MAY HAVE ASSUMED IN PRACTICE IT WAS THE EXERCISE BERLIN REICHSTAG SPEECH OF JANUARY 30 1937BERLING REICHSTAGSPEECH OF JANUARY 30 1937MEN DEPUTIES OF THE GERMAN REICHSTAG THE REICHSTAG HAS MET TODAY ON A DAY MOMENTOUS FOR THE GERMAN PEOPLE
FOUR YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE GREATEST NATIONAL REVOLUTION AND REFORMATION THAT GERMANY HAS EVER EXPERIENCED BEGAN THESE WERE THE FOUR YEARS WHICH I ASKED FOR AS A TRIAL PERIOD I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THERE HAS EVER BEEN SUCH A THOROUGH REVOLUTION AS OURS WHICH NEVERTHELESS LEFT UNMOLESTED NUMEROUS FORMER POLITICAL FUNCTIONARIES AND ALLOWED THEM TO WORK IN PEACE AND PAID PENSIONS TO ITS BITTEREST ENEMIES BUT OUR POLICY HAS NOT BEEN OF MUCH USE TO US AS FAR AS OTHER COUNTRIES ARE CONCERNED ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO HONORABLE BRITISH CITIZENS FELT THEY MUST MAKE A PROTEST TO US FOR DETAINING IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP ONE OF THE MOST CRIMINAL SUBJECTS OF MOSCOW PRESUMABLY HERR VON OSSIETZKY WINNER OF THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THESE HONORABLE MEN HAVE ALSO PROTESTED AGAINST THE SLAYING AND BURNING OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN SPAIN WE ARE ASSURED THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SLAIN IN SPAIN IS 170 000 ON THIS BASIS WE WOULD HAVE HAD THE RIGHT TO MURDER 400 000 TO 500 000 PEOPLE IN THE NAZI REVOLUTION THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST PROGRAM REPLACES THE LIBERALISTIC CONCEPTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL BY THE CONCEPTION OF A PEOPLE BOUND BY THEIR BLOOD TO THE SOIL OF ALL THE TASKS WITH WHICH WE ARE CONFRONTED IT IS THE GRANDEST AND MOST SACRED TASK OF MAN TO PRESERVE HIS RACE THIS WILL NOT LEAD TO AN ESTRANGEMENT OF THE NATIONS ON THE CONTRARY IT WILL LEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME TO A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING IT WILL ALSO PREVENT THE JEWISH PEOPLE FROM TRYING TO DISINTEGRATE AND DOMINATE OTHER PEOPLE UNDER THE MASK OF AN INNOCENT BOURGEOISIE WITHIN A FEW WEEKS THE SOCIAL PREJUDICES OF A THOUSAND YEARS WERE SWEPT AWAY SO GREAT WAS THE REVOLUTION THAT ITS SPIRITUAL FOUNDATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN UNDERSTOOD EVEN TODAY BY A SUPERFICIAL WORLD THEY SPEAK OF DEMOCRACIES AND DICTATORSHIPS AND HAVE NOT REALIZED THAT IN THIS COUNTRY A REVOLUTION HAS TAKEN PLACE THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS DEMOCRATIC IN THE HIGHEST SENSE OF THE WORD DOES A MORE GLORIOUS SOCIALISM OR A TRUER DEMOCRACY EXIST THAN THAT WHICH ENABLES ANY GERMAN BOY TO FIND HIS WAY TO THE HEAD OF THE NATION THE PURPOSE OF THE REVOLUTION WAS NOT TO DEPRIVE A PRIVILEGED CLASS OF ITS RIGHTS BUT TO RAISE A CLASS WITHOUT RIGHTS TO EQUALITY THERE IS NOW ONLY ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF GERMAN SOVEREIGNTY THE PEOPLE ITSELF THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE FINDS ITS EXPRESSION IN THE PARTY AS ITS POLITICAL ORGANIZATION THEREFORE THERE IS ONLY ONE LEGISLATIVE BODY THERE IS ONLY ONE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THEREFORE THE PEOPLE IS THE BASIS AND PARTY STATE ARMY INDUSTRY JUSTICE ETC ARE ONLY THE MEANS OF MAINTAINING THE PEOPLE IN A NEW PENAL CODE JUSTICE WILL BE PUT FOR ALL TIME INTO THE SERVICE OF MAINTAINING THE GERMAN RACE WHEN I TOOK OVER POWER THERE WERE MORE THAN 6 000 000 UNEMPLOYED AND THE FARMERS SEEMED DOOMED TO DECAY TODAY YOU MUST ADMIT THAT I HAVE FULFILLED MY PROMISES THE FOUR YEAR PLAN WILL GIVE PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT TO THOSE WORKMEN WHO ARE NOW BEING RELEASED FROM THE ARMAMENT INDUSTRY IT IS SIGNIFICANT FOR THE GIGANTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE THAT THERE IS TODAY A LACK OF TRAINED WORKMEN IN MANY INDUSTRIES THERE WILL BE NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS IN GERMANY BECAUSE EVERY ONE HAS TO SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE ENTIRE NATION EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE WILL NEVER COME TO AN END AND THIS EDUCATION INCLUDES THE HITLER YOUTH THE LABOR SERVICE THE PARTY AND THE ARMY AS WELL AS BOOKS NEWSPAPERS THEATERS AND FILMS THE RESTORATION OF GERMANY'S EQUALITY OF STATUS WAS AN EVENT WHICH EXCLUSIVELY CONCERNS GERMANY HERSELF WE HAVE NEVER TAKEN ANYTHING FROM ANY PEOPLE OR HARMED ANY PEOPLE IN THIS SENSE I WILL DEPRIVE THE GERMAN RAILWAYS AND THE REICHSBANK OF THEIR FORMER CHARACTER AND PLACE BOTH WITHOUT RESERVATION UNDER THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE GOVERNMENT THE TIME OF SO CALLED SURPRISES HAS THUS BEEN ENDED I SOLEMNLY WITHDRAW THE GERMAN SIGNATURE FROM THE DECLARATION EXTRACTED BY FORCE FROM A WEAK GOVERNMENT AGAINST ITS BETTER JUDGMENT THAT GERMANY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAR THE RESTORATION OF THE HONOR OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT AND THE MOST AUDACIOUS TASK AND WORK OF MY LIFE AS AN EQUAL STATE GERMANY IS CONSCIOUS OF ITS EUROPEAN TASK TO CO OPERATE LOYALLY IN REMOVING THE PROBLEMS WHICH AFFECT US AND OTHER NATIONS MY VIEWS CONCERNING THESE PROB LEMS CAN PERHAPS BE MOST SUITABLY STATED BY REFERRING TO THE STATEMENTS RECENTLY MADE BY MR EDEN IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS I SHOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING A REPLY OFFERED ME BY THE FRANK AND NOTABLE STATEMENT OF THE BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER I SHALL FIRST TRY TO CORRECT WHAT SEEMS TO ME A MOST REGRETTABLE ERROR NAMELY THAT GERMANY NEVER HAD ANY INTENTION OF ISOLATING HERSELF OF PASSING BY THE EVENTS OF THE REST OF THE WORLD WITHOUT SHARING THEM OR THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO PAY ANY CONSIDERATION TO GENERAL NECESSITIES I SHOULD LIKE TO ASSURE MR EDEN THAT WE GERMANS DO NOT IN THE LEAST WANT TO BE ISOLATED AND THAT WE DO NOT FEEL AT ALL THAT WE

PIECES THE CHARGE OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT FOR SHE DECLARES US GUILTLESS WILHELMSHAVEN SPEECH OF APRIL 1 1939WILHELMSHAVENSPEECH OF APRIL 1 1939GERMAN FELLOW CITIZENS HE WHO WANTS TO HAVE THE DEEPEST IMPRESSION OF THE DECAY AND RESURRECTION OF GERMANY MOST VIVIDLY MUST GO AND SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CITY LIKE WILHELMSHAVEN WHICH TODAY REVERBERATES WITH LIFE AND ACTIVITY AND WHICH STILL A SHORT TIME AGO WAS A DEAD SPOT NEARLY WITHOUT MEANS OF EXISTENCE AND WITHOUT PROSPECTS OF A FUTURE IT PAYS TO REVISUALIZE THIS PAST WHEN THIS CITY EXPERIENCED ITS FIRST UPWARD MOVE IT COINCIDED WITH THE RISE OF THE GERMAN REICH AFTER ITS UNIFICATION THIS GERMANY WAS IN A STATE OF PEACE DURING THE SAME TIME AS THE SO CALLED PEACE LOVING AND PURITAN NATIONS LED A GREAT NUMBER OF WARS GERMANY THEN KNEW ONLY ONE AIM TO MAINTAIN PEACE TO WORK IN PEACE TO RAISE THE PROSPERITY OF ITS INHABITANTS AND THEREBY TO CONTRIBUTE TO HUMAN CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION THIS GERMANY OF PEACE TIMES HAS ATTEMPTED WITH UNENDING DILIGENCE WITH GENIALITY AND WITH STEADINESS TO FORM ITS LIFE WITHIN AND TO SAFEGUARD OUTWARDLY THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN PEACEFUL COMPETITION WITH THE NATIONS ITS DUE PLACE IN THE SUN EVEN THOUGH THIS GERMANY THROUGH THE DECADES WAS THE SAFEST GUARANTOR OF PEACE AND EVEN THOUGH SHE OCCUPIED HERSELF WITH PEACEFUL THINGS SHE WAS UNABLE TO PREVENT OTHER NATIONS AND ESPECIALLY THEIR STATESMEN FROM FOLLOWING THIS RISE WITH ENVY AND HATRED AND FINALLY TO ANSWER WITH A WAR TODAY WE KNOW FROM THE DOCUMENTS OF HISTORY HOW THE ENCIRCLEMENT POLICY OF THOSE TIMES WAS CARRIED ON IN A PLANNED WAY BY ENGLAND WE KNOW FROM NUMEROUS FINDINGS AND PUBLICATIONS THAT IN THAT COUNTRY THE CONCEPTION WAS THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BRING DOWN GERMANY MILITARILY BECAUSE ITS DESTRUCTION WOULD INSURE EVERY BRITISH CITIZEN A GREATER ABUNDANCE OF LIFE'S POSSESSIONS CERTAINLY AT THAT TIME GERMANY MADE MISTAKES ITS MOST SERIOUS MISTAKE WAS TO SEE THIS ENCIRCLEMENT AND NOT TO STAVE IT OFF IN TIME THE ONLY FAULT WE CAN BLAME THE REGIME OF THAT TIME FOR IS THAT THE REICH HAD FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THIS DEVILISH PLAN OF A RAID AND YET IT DID NOT HAVE THE POWER OF DECISION TO WARD IT OFF IN TIME AND COULD ONLY LET THIS ENCIRCLEMENT RIPEN UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE CATASTROPHE THE RESULT WAS THE WORLD WAR IN THIS WAR THE GERMAN PEOPLE ALTHOUGH IT HAD BY NO MEANS THE BEST ARMAMENTS FOUGHT HEROICALLY NO PEOPLE CAN CLAIM THE GLORY FOR ITSELF TO HAVE FORCED US DOWN MUCH LESS SO THAT NATION WHOSE STATESMEN TODAY SPEAK THE GREATEST WORDS GERMANY AT THAT TIME REMAINED UNDEFEATED AND UNCONQUERED ON LAND AT SEA AND IN THE AIR HOWEVER IT WAS GERMANY BUT THERE WAS THE POWER OF THE LIE AND THE POISON OF PROPAGANDA WHICH DID NOT BALK AT MISINTERPRETATION AND UNTRUTH THIS GERMANY FACED THE WORLD IN ABSOLUTE DEFENSELESSNESS BECAUSE IT WAS UNPREPARED WHEN PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON'S FOURTEEN POINTS WERE PUBLISHED NOT ONLY MANY GERMAN FELLOW CITIZENS BUT ABOVE ALL THE 'LEADING' MEN SAW IN THESE FOURTEEN POINTS NOT ONLY THE POSSIBILITY OF ENDING THE WORLD WAR BUT ALSO THE PACIFICATION OF THE WORLD AT LARGE A PEACE OF RECONCILIATION AND UNDERSTANDING WAS PROMISED A PEACE THAT WAS TO KNOW NEITHER VICTOR NOR VANQUISHED A PEACE OF EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL A PEACE OF EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF COLONIAL DOMAINS AND EQUAL RECOGNITION OF COLONIAL DESIRES A PEACE THAT WAS TO BE FINALLY CROWNED BY A LEAGUE OF ALL FREE NATIONS IT WAS TO BE A GUARANTOR OF EQUAL RIGHTS THAT WOULD MAKE IT SEEM SUPERFLUOUS IN THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLES TO BEAR THE ARMAMENTS THAT PREVIOUSLY SO IT WAS SAID WERE SO HEAVILY BURDENSOME THEREFORE DISARMAMENT DISARMAMENT OF ALL THE NATIONS GERMANY WAS TO GO AHEAD AS A GOOD EXAMPLE EVERYBODY WAS OBLIGED TO FOLLOW THIS DISARMAMENT ALSO THE AGE OF SECRET DIPLOMACY WAS TO BE ENDED ALL PROBLEMS HENCEFORTH WERE TO BE DISCUSSED OPENLY AND FREELY FIRST OF ALL HOWEVER THE RIGHT OF SELF DETERMINATION OF NATIONS FINALLY WAS TO HAVE BEEN SETTLED AND RAISED TO ITS PROPER IMPORTANCE GERMANY BELIEVED IN THESE ASSURANCES WITH FAITH IN THESE DECLARATIONS IT HAD DROPPED ITS WEAPONS AND THEN A BREACH OF A PLEDGE BEGAN SUCH AS WORLD HISTORY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE WHEN OUR NATION HAD DROPPED ITS WEAPONS A PERIOD OF SUPPRESSION BLACKMAILING PLUNDERING AND SLAVERY BEGAN NOT ANOTHER WORD ABOUT PEACE WITHOUT VICTOR OR VANQUISHED BUT AN ENDLESS SENTENCE OF CONDEMNATION FOR THE VANQUISHED NOT ANOTHER WORD ABOUT JUSTICE BUT OF JUSTICE ON YOUR SIDE AND INJUSTICE AND ILLEGALITY ON THE OTHER ROBBERY UPON ROBBERY OPPRESSION UPON OPPRESSION WERE THE CONSEQUENCES NO ONE IN THIS DEMOCRATIC WORLD BOTHERED HIMSELF ANY MORE ABOUT THE SUFFERINGS OF OUR PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FELL IN THE WAR NOT FROM ENEMY WEAPONS BUT FROM THE HUNGER BLOCKADE AND AFTER THE WAR ENDED THIS BLOCKADE WAS CONTINUED FOR MONTHS IN ORDER TO OPPRESS OUR PEOPLE STILL MORE EVEN GERMAN WAR PRISONERS AFTER AN ENDLESS TIME HAD TO REMAIN IN CAPTIVITY THE GERMAN COLONIES WERE STOLEN FROM US GERMAN FOREIGN HOLDINGS WERE SIMPLY SEIZED AND OUR MERCHANT MARINE TAKEN AWAY ADDED TO THAT WAS A FINANCIAL PLUNDERING SUCH AS THE WORLD HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN THE MONETARY PENALTIES WHICH WERE IMPOSED ON THE GERMAN PEOPLE REACHED ASTRONOMICAL FIGURES OF THESE AN ENGLISH STATESMAN SAID THAT THEY COULD ONLY BE FULFILLED WHEN THE GERMAN STANDARD OF LIVING WAS REDUCED TO THE LOWEST POSSIBLE LEVEL AND GERMANS WORKED FOURTEEN HOURS DAILY WHAT GERMAN SPIRIT GERMAN ALERTNESS AND GERMAN LABOR THROUGH DECADES AND DECADES HAD COLLECTED AND SAVED WAS LOST IN A FEW YEARS MILLIONS OF GERMANS WERE EITHER TORN AWAY FROM THE REICH OR WERE PREVENTED
FROM RETURNING TO THE REICH THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS WAS NOT AN INSTRUMENT OF A JUST POLICY OF UNDERSTANDING AMONG NATIONS BUT IS AND WAS A GUARANTEE OF THE MEANEST DICTATION MAN EVER INVENTED SO WAS A GREAT PEOPLE RAPED AND LED TOWARD A MISERY THAT YOU ALL KNOW A GREAT PEOPLE THROUGH A BROKEN PLEDGE WAS CHEATED OF ITS RIGHTS AND ITS EXISTENCE RENDERED PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE A FRENCH STATESMAN COINED THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSION 'THERE ARE 20 000 000 GERMANS TOO MANY IN THE WORLD 'GERMANS ENDED THEIR LIVES OUT OF DESPAIR OTHERS SLID INTO LETHARGY AND AN INEVITABLE DESTINY AND STILL OTHERS WERE OF THE OPINION THAT EVERYTHING MUST BE DESTROYED STILL OTHERS SET THEIR TEETH AND CLENCHED THEIR FISTS IN UNCONSCIOUS RAGE STILL OTHERS BELIEVED THAT THE PAST SHOULD BE RESTORED RESTORED JUST AS IT WAS EVERYONE HAD AN IDEA OF SOME SORT AND I AS AN UNKNOWN SOLDIER OF THE WORLD WAR DREW MY CONCLUSIONS IT WAS A VERY SHORT AND SIMPLE PROGRAM IT RAN REMOVAL OF THE INTERNAL ENEMIES OF THE NATION TERMINATION OF THE DIVISIONS WITHIN GERMANY THE GATHERING UP OF THE ENTIRE NATIONAL STRENGTH OF OUR PEOPLE INTO A NEW COMMUNITY AND THE BREAKING OF THE PEACE TREATY IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER FOR AS LONG AS THIS DICTATE OF VERSAILLES WEIGHED UPON THE GERMAN PEOPLE IT WAS ACTUALLY DAMNED TO GO TO THE GROUND IF HOWEVER OTHER STATESMEN NOW DECLARE THAT RIGHT MUST RULE ON THIS EARTH THEN THEY SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THEIR CRIME IS NO RIGHT THAT THEIR DICTATE IS NEITHER RIGHT NOR LAW BUT ABOVE THIS DICTATE STAND THE ETERNAL RIGHTS OF PEOPLES TO LIVE THE GERMAN PEOPLE WERE NOT CREATED BY PROVIDENCE IN ORDER TO FOLLOW OBEDIENTLY A LAW WHICH SUITS THE ENGLISH OR THE FRENCH BUT RATHER IN ORDER TO CHAMPION THEIR RIGHT TO LIVE THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE I WAS DETERMINED TO TAKE UP THIS BATTLE OF ADVOCATING THE GERMAN RIGHT TO LIVE I TOOK IT UP FIRST WITHIN THE NATION IN PLACE OF A GREAT NUMBER OF PARTIES SOCIAL RANKS AND SOCIETIES A SINGLE COMMUNITY NOW HAS TAKEN ITS PLACE THE GERMAN NATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BRING IT TO REALIZATION AND TO DEEPEN IT MORE AND MORE IS OUR TASK I HAD TO HURT MANY IN THIS TIME HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THE GOOD FORTUNE IN WHICH THE ENTIRE NATION IS PARTICIPATING TODAY MUST RICHLY COMPENSATE EVERY SINGLE ONE FOR WHAT HE HAD TO GIVE UP DEARLY ON HIS OWN PART YOU ALL HAVE SACRIFICED YOUR PARTIES SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS BUT YOU HAVE OBTAINED IN RETURN A GREAT STRONG REICH AND THE REICH TODAY THANK GOD IS STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE YOUR RIGHTS UNDER ITS PROTECTION WE NO LONGER ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GOOD GRACES OR DISGRACES OF OTHER STATES OR THEIR STATESMEN WHEN MORE THAN SIX YEARS AGO I OBTAINED POWER I TOOK OVER A WRETCHED INHERITANCE THE REICH SEEMED TO POSSESS NO MORE POSSIBILITIES OF EXISTENCE FOR ITS CITIZENS I UNDERTOOK THE WORK AT THAT TIME WITH THE ONE SINGLE CAPITAL WHICH I POSSESSED IT WAS THE CAPITAL OF YOUR STRENGTH TO WORK YOUR STRENGTH TO WORK MY FELLOW CITIZENS I NOW HAVE BEGUN TO PUT TO USE I HAD NO FOREIGN EXCHANGE I HAD NO GOLD RESERVE I HAD ONLY ONE THING MY FAITH AND YOUR WORK THUS WE BEGAN THE GIGANTIC WORK OF REBUILDING BASED UPON THE CONFIDENCE OF THE NATION INSTILLED WITH THE BELIEF AND THE CONFIDENCE IN ITS ETERNAL VALUES NOW WE HAVE FOUND A NEW ECONOMIC SYSTEM A SYSTEM WHICH IS THIS CAPITAL IS THE POWER OF LABOR AND THE COVERAGE OF MONEY LIES IN OUR PRODUCTION WE HAVE FOUNDED A SYSTEM BASED ON THE MOST SINCERE FOUNDATION THERE IS NAMELY FORM YOUR LIFE YOURSELF WORK FOR YOUR EXISTENCE HELP YOURSELF AND GOD WILL HELP YOU WITHIN A FEW YEARS WE HAVE WRENCHED GERMANY FROM DESPAIR BUT THE WORLD DID NOT HELP US IF TODAY AN ENGLISH STATESMAN SAYS ONE CAN AND MUST SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS THROUGH FRANK DELIBERATIONS I SHOULD LIKE TO TELL THIS STATESMAN JUST THIS AN OPPORTUNITY HAS BEEN OPEN FOR FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE OUR TIME IF THE WORLD SAYS TODAY THAT THE NATIONS MUST BE DIVIDED INTO VIRTUOUS NATIONS AND INTO SUCH AS ARE NOT VIRTUOUS AND THAT THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH BELONG TO THE FIRST CLASS AND THE GERMANS AND ITALIANS BELONG TO THOSE NOT VIRTUOUS WE CAN ONLY ANSWER THE JUDGMENT WHETHER A PEOPLE IS VIRTUOUS OR NOT VIRTUOUS CAN HARDLY BE PASSED BY A HUMAN BEING THAT SHOULD BE LEFT TO GOD PERHAPS THE SAME BRITISH STATESMAN WILL RETORT 'GOD HAS PASSED THE VERDICT ALREADY BECAUSE HE PRESENTED THE VIRTUOUS NATIONS WITH ONE QUARTER OF THE WORLD AND HE TOOK EVERYTHING AWAY FROM THE NONVIRTUOUS 'THE QUESTION MAY BE PERMITTED 'BY WHAT MEANS HAVE THE VIRTUOUS NATIONS OBTAINED FOR THEMSELVES THIS QUARTER OF THE WORLD 'AND ONE MUST ANSWER 'THEY DID NOT APPLY VIRTUOUS METHODS 'FOR 300 YEARS THIS ENGLAND ACTED WITHOUT VIRTUE IN ORDER NOW IN MATURITY TO SPEAK OF VIRTUE THUS IT COULD APPEAR THAT DURING THIS BRITISH PERIOD WITHOUT VIRTUE 46 000 000 ENGLISHMEN HAVE SUBDUED NEARLY ONE QUARTER OF THE WORLD WHILE 80 000 000 GERMANS BECAUSE OF THEIR VIRTUE MUST LIVE AT A RATE OF 140 TO ONE SQUARE KILOMETER INDEED TWENTY YEARS AGO THE QUESTION OF VIRTUE STILL WAS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR FOR THE BRITISH STATESMEN INSOFAR AS IT CONCERNED CONCEPTIONS OF PROPERTY ONE STILL HELD IT COMPATIBLE WITH VIRTUE SIMPLY TO TAKE AWAY THE COLONIES OF ANOTHER PEOPLE THAT HAD ACQUIRED THEM THROUGH TREATY OR THROUGH PURCHASE BECAUSE ONE POSSESSED THE POWER THIS VERY POWER WHICH NOW TO BE SURE SHOULD BE DEEMED AS SOMETHING ABOMINABLE AND DETESTABLE I HAVE ONLY ONE THING TO ASK THE GENTLEMEN HERE WHETHER THEY BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY OR DO NOT BELIEVE IT WE DO NOT KNOW WE ASSUME HOWEVER THAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY
FOR IF WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT THEY THEMSELVES REALLY BELIEVE IT THEN WE WOULD LOSE EVERY RESPECT FOR THEM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS GERMANY PATIENTLY BORE ITS LOT AND FATE I ALSO SOUGHT IN THE BEGINNING TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM THROUGH TALKS I MADE AN OFFER IN THE CASE OF EACH PROBLEM AND EACH TIME IT WAS TURNED DOWN THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT EVERY PEOPLE POSSESSES SACRED INTERESTS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE IDENTICAL WITH THEIR LIVES AND THEIR RIGHT TO LIVE WHEN TODAY A BRITISH STATESMAN DEMANDS THAT EVERY PROBLEM WHICH LIES IN THE MIDST OF GERMANY'S LIFE INTEREST FIRST SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH ENGLAND THEN I TOO COULD DEMAND JUST AS WELL THAT EVERY BRITISH PROBLEM FIRST IS TO BE DISCUSSED WITH US CERTAINLY THESE ENGLISHMEN MAY GIVE ME THE ANSWER 'THE GERMANS HAVE NO BUSINESS IN PALESTINE I ANSWER THAT WE DO NOT WANT ANYTHING IN PALESTINE JUST AS WE GERMANS HAVE LITTLE TO DO IN PALESTINE JUST AS LITTLE BUSINESS HAS ENGLAND MIXING IN OUR GERMAN SECTION OF EXISTENCE AND IF THEY NOW DECLARE THAT IT INVOLVES GENERAL QUESTIONS OF LAW AND JUSTICE I COULD APPROVE OF THIS OPINION ONLY IF IT WAS CONSIDERED AS BINDING TO BOTH OF US THEY SAY WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THIS OR THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO RAISE THE COUNTER QUESTION WHAT RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE HAS ENGLAND TO SHOOT DOWN ARABS IN PALESTINE JUST BECAUSE THEY DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND WHO GIVES THEM THIS RIGHT ANYWAY WE HAVE NOT SLAUGHTERED THOUSANDS IN CENTRAL EUROPE BUT INSTEAD WE HAVE REGULATED OUR PROBLEMS WITH LAW AND ORDER HOWEVER I SHOULD LIKE TO SAY ONE THING HERE THE GERMAN PEOPLE OF TODAY THE GERMAN REICH OF TODAY IS NOT WILLING TO SURRENDER LIFE INTERESTS IT ALSO IS NOT WILLING TO FACE RISING DANGERS WITHOUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THEM WHEN THE ALLIES WITHOUT REGARD OR PURPOSE RIGHT TRADITION OR EVEN REASONABLENESS CHANGED THE MAP OF EUROPE WE HAD NOT THE POWER TO PREVENT IT IF HOWEVER THEY EXPECT THE GERMANY OF TODAY TO SIT PATIENTLY BY UNTIL THE VERY LAST DAY WHEN THIS SAME RESULT WOULD AGAIN BE REPEATED WHILE THEY CREATE SATELLITE STATES AND SET THEM AGAINST GERMANY THEN THEY ARE MISTAKING THE GERMANY OF TODAY FOR THE GERMANY OF BEFORE THE WAR HE WHO DECLARES HIMSELF READY TO PULL THE CHESTNUTS OUT OF THE FIRE FOR THESE POWERS MUST REALIZE HE BURNS HIS FINGERS REALLY WE FEEL NO HATRED AGAINST THE CZECH PEOPLE WE HAVE LIVED TOGETHER FOR YEARS THE ENGLISH STATESMEN DO NOT KNOW THIS THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT HRADCANY CASTLE WAS NOT BUILT BY AN ENGLISHMAN BUT BY A GERMAN AND THAT THE ST VITUS CATHEDRAL LIKEWISE WAS NOT ERECTED BY ENGLISHMEN BUT THAT GERMAN HANDS DID IT EVEN THE FRENCH WERE NOT ACTIVE THERE THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT ALREADY AT A TIME WHEN ENGLAND STILL WAS VERY SMALL A GERMAN KAISER WAS PAID HOMAGE ON THIS HILL HRADCANY CASTLE THAT ONE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE ME THE FIRST GERMAN KING STOOD THERE AND ACCEPTED THE HOMAGE OF THIS PEOPLE ENGLISHMEN DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY COULD NOT KNOW THAT AND THEY DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW IT IT IS SUFFICIENT THAT WE KNOW IT AND THAT IT IS TRUE THAT THIS TERRITORY LAY IN THE LIVING SPACE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE FOR OVER A THOUSAND YEARS DESPITE THIS HOWEVER WE WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING AGAINST AN INDEPENDENT CZECH STATE IF FIRST IT HAD NOT SUPPRESSED GERMANS AND SECOND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN INTENDED AS THE INSTRUMENT OF A FUTURE ATTACK ON GERMANY WHEN HOWEVER A FORMER FRENCH AIR MINISTER WRITES IN A NEWSPAPER THAT ON THE BASIS OF THEIR PROMINENT POSITION IT IS THE TASK OF THESE CZECHS TO STRIKE AT THE HEART OF GERMAN INDUSTRY WITH AIR ATTACKS DURING WAR THEN ONE UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS NOT WITHOUT INTEREST TO US AND THAT WE DRAW CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS FROM IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UP TO ENGLAND AND FRANCE TO DEFEND THIS AIRBASE UPON US FELL THE TASK OF PREVENTING SUCH AN ATTACK AT ALL EVENTS I SOUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BY A NATURAL AND SIMPLE WAY WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT EVERY EFFORT OF THAT KIND WAS DESTINED TO BE WRECKED AND THAT ELEMENTS HOSTILE TO GERMANY AGAIN WOULD WIN THE UPPER HAND AND AS I FURTHER SAW THAT THIS STATE HAD LONG SINCE LOST ITS INNER VITALITY INDEED THAT IT ALREADY WAS BROKEN TO PIECES I AGAIN CARRIED THROUGH THE OLD GERMAN REICH AND I JOINED TOGETHER AGAIN WHAT HAD TO BE UNITED BECAUSE OF HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL POSITIONS AND ACCORDING TO ALL RULES OF REASON NOT TO OPPRESS THE CZECH PEOPLE IT WILL ENJOY MORE FREEDOM THAN THE SUPPRESSED PEOPLE OF THE VIRTUOUS NATIONS I HAVE SO I BELIEVE THEREBY RENDERED PEACE A GREAT SERVICE BECAUSE I HAVE RENDERED INNOCUOUS IN TIME AN INSTRUMENT WHICH WAS DESTINED TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IN WAR AGAINST GERMANY IF THEY NOW SAY THAT THIS IS THE SIGNAL THAT GERMANY NOW WANTS TO ATTACK THE ENTIRE WORLD I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS MEANT SERIOUSLY SUCH COULD ONLY BE THE EXPRESSION OF A BAD CONSCIENCE PERHAPS IT IS RAGE OVER THE FAILURE OF A FAR FLUNG PLAN PERHAPS IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE TACTICAL PRECONDITIONS FOR A NEW POLICY OF ENCIRCLEMENT BE THAT AS IT MAY IT IS MY CONVICTION THAT THEREBY I HAVE RENDERED PEACE A GREAT SERVICE AND OUT OF THIS CONVICTION I DECIDED THREE WEEKS AGO TO NAME THE COMING PARTY RALLY THE 'PARTY CONVENTION OF PEACE 'FOR GERMANY HAS NO INTENTION OF ATTACKING OTHER PEOPLE
WHAT WE HOWEVER DO NOT WANT TO RENOUNCE IS THE BUILDING UP OF OUR ECONOMIC RELATIONS WE HAVE A RIGHT THERETO AND I DO NOT ACCEPT ANY CONDITION FROM A EUROPEAN OR A NON EUROPEAN STATESMAN THE GERMAN REICH IS NOT ONLY A GREAT PRODUCER BUT ALSO A GIGANTIC CONSUMER JUST AS WE AS A PRODUCER WILL BE AN IRREPLACEABLE TRADE PARTNER SO AS A CONSUMER WE ARE CAPABLE OF HONORABLY AND FAIRLY PAYING FOR WHAT WE CONSUME WE ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT MAKING WAR ON OTHER PEOPLES HOWEVER OUR PRECONDITION IS THAT THEY LEAVE US IN PEACE IN ANY CASE THE GERMAN REICH IS NOT READY EVERLASTINGLY TO ACCEPT INTIMIDATION OR EVEN A POLICY OF ENCIRCLEMENT I ONCE MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH ENGLAND NAMELY THE NAVAL TREATY IT IS BASED ON THE EARNEST DESIRE WHICH WE ALL POSSESS NEVER TO HAVE TO GO TO WAR AGAINST ENGLAND BUT THIS WISH CAN ONLY BE A MUTUAL ONE IF THIS WISH NO LONGER EXISTS IN ENGLAND THEN THE PRACTICAL PRECONDITIONS FOR THIS AGREEMENT THEREWITH ARE REMOVED AND GERMANY ALSO WOULD ACCEPT THIS VERY CALMLY WE ARE SELF ASSURED BECAUSE WE ARE STRONG AND WE ARE STRONG BECAUSE WE ARE UNITED AND BECAUSE IN ADDITION WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD AND IN THIS CITY MY FELLOW CITIZENS I CAN ADDRESS THE ONE EXHORTATION TO YOU LOOK INTO THE WORLD AND TO ALL ITS HAPPENINGS WITH OPEN EYES DO NOT DECEIVE YOURSELVES ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PRECONDITION IN LIFE NAMELY THE NECESSITY TO BE STRONG WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THEREFORE I HAVE MADE GERMANY STRONG AGAIN AND ERECTED AN ARMED FORCE AN ARMY ON LAND AT SEA AND IN THE AIR WHEN THEY SAY IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT THEY WILL ARM AND WILL KEEP ARMING STILL MORE I CAN TELL THOSE STATESMEN ONLY THIS THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TIRE ME OUT I AM DETERMINED TO PROCEED ON THIS ROAD AND I HAVE A CONVICTION THAT WE SHALL PROCEED FASTER THAN THE OTHERS NO POWER ON EARTH WILL EVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO ENTICE THE WEAPONS FROM US THROUGH ANY PHRASE SHOULD HOWEVER SOMEBODY BE CRAVING FOR MEASURING THEIR STRENGTH WITH OURS THEN THE GERMAN PEOPLE ALSO ARE READY AT ANY TIME AND I AM READY AND DETERMINED JUST AS WE THINK OUR FRIENDS ALSO THINK ESPECIALLY THE STATE WITH WHICH WE ARE BOUND MOST CLOSELY AND WITH WHICH WE ARE MARCHING NOW AND WILL MARCH UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES FOREVER IF HOSTILE JOURNALISTS DO NOT KNOW OF ANYTHING ELSE TO WRITE THEN THEY WRITE ABOUT RENTS OR BREAKS IN THE AXIS THEY OUGHT TO HOLD THEIR PEACE THIS AXIS IS THE MOST NATURAL POLITICAL INSTRUMENT EXISTING IN THIS WORLD IT IS A POLITICAL COMBINATION WHICH OWES ITS ORIGIN NOT ONLY TO REASONABLE POLITICAL DELIBERATION AND THE DESIRE FOR JUSTICE BUT ALSO TO THE POWER OF AN IDEAL THIS CONSTRUCTION WILL BE MORE DURABLE THAN THE MOMENTARY TIES OF NONHOMOGENEOUS BODIES ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR IF SOME ONE TELLS ME TODAY THAT THERE ARE NO PHILOSOPHICAL OR IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES OF ANY KIND BETWEEN ENGLAND AND SOVIET RUSSIA THEN I CAN ONLY SAY 'I CONGRATULATE YOU GENTLEMEN 'I BELIEVE THAT THE TIME IS NOT FAR DISTANT IN WHICH THE PHILOSOPHICAL COMMUNITY BETWEEN FASCIST ITALY AND NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMANY WILL PROVE ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC GREAT BRITAIN AND THE BOLSHEVIST RUSSIA OF STALIN HOWEVER IF THERE REALLY SHOULD BE NO IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE THEN I CAN ONLY SAY HOW CORRECT INDEED IS MY POSITION TOWARD MARXISM AND COMMUNISM AND DEMOCRACY WHY TWO PHENOMENA IF THEY POSSESS THE SAME CONTENTS IN THESE DAYS WE EXPERIENCE A VERY GREAT TRIUMPH AND A DEEP INNER SATISFACTION A COUNTRY WHICH ALSO WAS DEVASTATED BY BOLSHEVISM WHERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HUMAN BEINGS WOMEN MEN CHILDREN AND PATRIARCHS HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED HAS LIBERATED ITSELF LIBERATED DESPITE ALL THE IDEOLOGICAL FRIENDS OF BOLSHEVISM WHO SIT IN GREAT BRITAIN FRANCE AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES WE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS SPAIN ONLY TOO WELL IN ITS STRUGGLE AND WE GREET AND CONGRATULATE IT FOR ITS SUCCESS WE GERMANS OF TODAY CAN EXPRESS THIS WITH SPECIAL PRIDE SINCE MANY GERMAN YOUNG MEN HAVE DONE THEIR DUTY THERE THEY HAVE HELPED AS VOLUNTEERS TO BREAK A TYRANNIC REGIME AND TO RETURN TO A NATION THE RIGHT OF SELF DETERMINATION WE ARE PLEASED TO NOTE HOW FAST HOW EXTREMELY FAST THE PHILOSOPHICAL CHANGE CAME OVER THE DELIVERERS OF WAR MATERIAL ON THE RED SIDE WE NOTE HOW MUCH THEY NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN UNDERSTAND THIS NATIONAL SPAIN AND HOW READY THEY ARE TO CONDUCT WITH THIS NATIONAL SPAIN IF NOT PHILOSOPHICAL THEN AT LEAST ECONOMIC BUSINESS THIS ALSO IS A SIGN SHOWING THE TREND OF DEVELOPMENT MY FELLOW CITIZENS I BELIEVE THAT ALL STATES WILL BE FACING THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH WE HAVE FACED STATE AFTER STATE WILL EITHER FALL UNDER THE JEWISH BOLSHEVIST PEST OR IT WILL DEFEND ITSELF WE HAVE DONE IT AND HAVE NOW ERECTED A NATIONAL GERMAN PEOPLE'S STATE THIS PEOPLE'S STATE WANTS TO LIVE IN PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP WITH ANY OTHER STATE BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN LET ITSELF BE FORCED DOWN BY ANOTHER STATE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE WORLD WILL BECOME FASCIST BUT I AM DEEPLY CONVINCED THAT THIS WORLD IN THE END WILL DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST THE MOST SEVERE BOLSHEVISTIC THREAT THAT EXISTS THEREFORE I BELIEVE THAT A FINAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN NATIONS WILL COME SOONER OR LATER ONLY WHEN THIS JEWISH WEDGE AMONG PEOPLES IS REMOVED CAN
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CO OPERATION AMONG NATIONS BUILT ON LASTING UNDERSTANDING BE CONSIDERED TODAY WE MUST RELY UPON OUR OWN STRENGTH AND WE CAN BE SATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS OF THIS TRUST IN OURSELVES INWARDLY AND OUTWARDLY WHEN I CAME TO POWER MY FELLOW CITIZENS GERMANY WAS DIVIDED AND IMPOTENT INTERNALLY AND OUTWARDLY THE SPORT OF FOREIGN DESIGNS TODAY WE ARE IN ORDER DOMESTICALLY OUR BUSINESS IS FLOURISHING ABROAD PERHAPS WE ARE NOT LOVED BUT RESPECTED YET WE RECEIVE ATTENTION THAT IS THE DECISIVE FACTOR ABOVE ALL WE HAVE GIVEN THE GREATEST POSSIBLE GOOD FORTUNE TO MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS THE RETURN INTO OUR GREATER GERMAN REICH SECOND WE HAVE GIVEN CENTRAL EUROPE A GREAT PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE NAMELY PEACE PEACE THAT WILL BE PROTECTED BY GERMAN MIGHT AND THIS MIGHT CAN NO LONGER BE BROKEN BY ANY WORLD POWER THAT IS OUR PLEDGE SO WE WILL SHOW THAT OVER TWO MILLION CITIZENS DID NOT FALL IN THE GREAT WAR IN VAIN FROM THEIR SACRIFICE CAME GREATER GERMANY FROM THEIR SACRIFICE WAS THIS STRONG YOUNG GERMAN PEOPLE THAT THE REICH CALLED INTO BEING AND THAT HAS NOW MADE ITSELF FELT IN THE FACE OF THIS SACRIFICE WE SHALL NOT SHY AWAY FROM ANY SACRIFICE IF IT IS EVER NECESSARY LET THE WORLD UNDERSTAND THAT IT CAN MAKE PACTS AND DRAW UP DECLARATIONS AS MUCH AS IT WISHES I HAVE NO FAITH IN PAPER BUT I DO HAVE FAITH IN YOU MY FELLOW CITIZENS THE GREATEST BREACH OF FAITH OF ALL TIME WAS COMMITTED AGAINST US GERMANS LET US TAKE CARE THAT OUR PEOPLE INTERNALLY ARE NEVER AGAIN IN A POSITION TO BE BROKEN THEN NO ONE IN THE WORLD WILL THREATEN US THEN PEACE WILL EITHER BE MAINTAINED FOR OUR PEOPLE OR IF NECESSARY PEACE WILL BE ENFORCED THEN OUR PEOPLE WILL BLOOM AND FLOURISH OUR PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT THEIR GENIALITY THEIR ABILITY THEIR DILIGENCE AND STEADFASTNESS INTO THE WORKS OF PEACE AND HUMAN CULTURE THIS IS OUR DESIRE WE HOPE FOR IT AND WE BELIEVE IN IT TWENTY YEARS AGO THAT PARTY WAS FOUNDED AT THAT TIME A TINY ORGANIZATION CONSIDER THE ROAD FROM THAT TIME UNTIL TODAY CONSIDER THE WONDERS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED ABOUT US BELIEVE THEREFORE BECAUSE OF THIS WONDERFUL ROAD ALSO IN THE COURSE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE IN ITS COMING GREAT FUTURE GERMANY SIEG HEIL SIEG HEIL SIEG HEIL BERLIN HITLER'S ORDER OF THE DAY APRIL 6 1941BERLIN HITLER'S ORDER OF THE DAYAPRIL 6 1941FROM BERLIN PROPAGANDA MINISTER GOEBBELS READS THE FOLLOWING ORDER OF THE DAY TO THE GERMAN ARMY OF THE EAST IN THE NAME OF THE FUEHRER SOLDIERS OF THE SOUTHEAST FRONT SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING THE GERMAN PEOPLE ARE AT WAR WITH THE BELGRADE GOVERNMENT OF INTRIGUE WE SHALL ONLY LAY DOWN ARMS WHEN THIS BAND OF RUFFIANS HAS BEEN DEFINITELY AND MOST EMPHATICALLY ELIMINATED AND THE LAST BRITON HAS LEFT THIS PART OF THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT THESE MISLED PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THEY MUST THANK BRITAIN FOR THIS SITUATION THEY MUST THANK ENGLAND THE GREATEST WARMONGER OF ALL TIME THE GERMAN PEOPLE CAN ENTER INTO THIS NEW STRUGGLE WITH THE INNER SATISFACTION THAT ITS LEADERS HAVE DONE EVERYTHING TO BRING ABOUT A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT WE PRAY TO GOD THAT HE MAY LEAD OUR SOLDIERS ON THE PATH AND BLESS THEM AS HITHERTO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICY OF LETTING OTHERS FIGHT FOR HER AS SHE DID IN THE CASE OF POLAND BRITAIN AGAIN TRIED TO INVOLVE GERMANY IN THE STRUGGLE IN WHICH BRITAIN HOPED THAT SHE WOULD FINISH OFF THE GERMAN PEOPLE ONCE AND FOR ALL TO WIN THE WAR AND IF POSSIBLE TO DESTROY THE ENTIRE GERMAN ARMY IN A FEW WEEKS LONG AGO THE GERMAN SOLDIERS ON THE EASTERN FRONT SWEPT ASIDE POLAND THE INSTRUMENT OF BRITISH POLICY ON APRIL 9 1940 BRITAIN AGAIN ATTEMPTED TO REACH ITS GOAL BY A THRUST ON THE GERMAN NORTH FLANK THE THRUST AT NORWAY IN AN UNFORGETTABLE STRUGGLE THE GERMAN SOLDIERS IN NORWAY ELIMINATED THE BRITISH WITHIN A PERIOD OF A FEW WEEKS WHAT THE WORLD DID NOT DEEM POSSIBLE THE GERMAN PEOPLE HAVE ACHIEVED AGAIN ONLY A FEW WEEKS LATER CHURCHILL THOUGHT THE MOMENT RIGHT TO MAKE A RENEWED THRUST THROUGH THE BRITISH ALLIES FRANCE AND BELGIUM INTO THE GERMAN REGION OF THE RUHR THE VICTORIOUS HOUR OF OUR SOLDIERS ON THE WEST FRONT BEGAN IT IS ALREADY WAR HISTORY HOW THE GERMAN ARMIES DEFEATED THE LEGIONS OF CAPITALISM AND PLUTOCRACY AFTER FORTY FIVE DAYS THIS CAMPAIGN IN THE WEST WAS EQUALLY AND EMPHATICALLY TERMINATED THEN CHURCHILL CONCENTRATED THE STRENGTH OF HIS EMPIRE AGAINST OUR ALLY ITALY IN AFRICA NOW THE DANGER HAS ALSO BEEN BANNED FROM THE AFRICAN THEATER OF THE WAR THROUGH THE CO OPERATION OF ITALIAN AND GERMAN UNITS THE NEW AIM OF THE BRITISH WARMONGERS NOW CONSISTS OF THE REALIZATION OF A PLAN THAT THEY HAD ALREADY HATCHED AT THE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR AND ONLY POSTPONED BECAUSE OF THE GIGANTIC VICTORIES OF THE GERMAN ARMY THE MEMORY OF THE LANDING OF BRITISH TROOPS AT SALONIKA IN THE COURSE OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR ALSO CAUGHT LITTLE GREECE IN THE SPIDER WEB OF BRITISH INTRIGUE I HAVE REPEATEDLY WARNED OF THE ATTEMPT BY THE BRITISH TO LAND TROOPS IN SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE AND I HAVE SAID THAT THIS CONSTITUTES A THREAT TO THE GERMAN REICH
UNFORTUNATELY THIS WARNING WENT UNHEEDED BY THE YUGOSLAV NATION I HAVE FURTHER TRIED ALWAYS WITH THE SAME PATIENCE TO CONVINCE YUGOSLAV STATESMEN OF THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR THEIR COOPERATION WITH THE GERMAN REICH FOR RESTORATION OF LASTING PEACE AND ORDER WITHIN YUGOSLAVIA AFTER LONG EFFORT WE FINALLY SUCCEEDED IN SECURING THE COOPERATION OF YUGOSLAVIA BY ITS ADHERENCE TO THE TRIPARTITE PACT WITHOUT HAVING DEMANDED ANYTHING WHATSOEVER OF THE YUGOSLAV NATION EXCEPT THAT IT TAKE ITS PART IN THE RECONSTRUCTION OF A NEW ORDER IN EUROPE AT THIS POINT THE CRIMINAL USURPERS OF THE NEW BELGRADE GOVERNMENT TOOK THE POWER OF THE STATE UNTO THEMSELVES WHICH IS A RESULT OF BEING IN THE PAY OF CHURCHILL AND BRITAIN AS IN THE CASE OF POLAND THIS NEW BELGRADE GOVERNMENT HAS MOBILIZED DECREPIT AND OLD PEOPLE INTO THEIR INNER CABINET UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS FORCED IMMEDIATELY TO RECALL THE GERMAN NATIONAL COLONY WITHIN YUGOSLAV TERRITORY MEMBERS AND OFFICERS OF THE GERMAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEES OF OUR CONSULATES IN YUGOSLAVIA WERE DAILY BEING SUBJECTED TO THE MOST HUMILIATING ATTACKS THE GERMAN SCHOOLS EXACTLY AS IN POLAND WERE LAID IN RUINS BY BANDITS INNUMERABLE GERMAN NATIONALS WERE KIDNAPED AND ATTACKED BY YUGOSLAVS AND SOME EVEN WERE KILLED IN ADDITION YUGOSLAVIA FOR WEEKS HAS PLANNED A GENERAL MOBILIZATION OF ITS ARMY IN GREAT SECRECY THIS IS THE ANSWER TO MY EIGHT YEAR LONG EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT CLOSER CO OPERATION AND FRIENDSHIP WITH THE YUGOSLAV PEOPLE A TASK THAT I HAVE PURSUED MOST FASTIDIOUSLY WHEN BRITISH DIVISIONS WERE LANDED IN GREECE JUST AS IN WORLD WAR DAYS THE SERBS THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIPE FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION FOR NEW ASSASSINATIONS AGAINST GERMANY AND HER ALLIES SOLDIERS OF THE SOUTHEAST FRONT NOW YOUR ZERO HOUR HAS ARRIVED YOU WILL NOW TAKE THE INTERESTS OF THE GERMAN REICH UNDER YOUR PROTECTION AS YOUR COMRADES DID A YEAR AGO IN NORWAY AND ON THE WEST FRONT YOU WILL DO JUST AS WELL ON THE SOUTHEAST FRONT IN DOING THIS YOUR DUTY YOU WILL NOT BE LESS COURAGEOUS THAN THE MEN OF THOSE GERMAN DIVISIONS WHO IN 1915 ON THE SAME BALKAN SOIL FOUGHT SO VICTORIOUSLY YOU WILL BE HUMANE ONLY IN THOSE PLACES WHERE THE ENEMY IS HUMANE TOWARD YOU WHERE THE ENEMY CONFRONTS YOU WITH UTTER BRUTALITY YOU WILL BEAT THEM BACK WITH THE SAME WEAPON THE FIGHT ON GREEK SOIL IS NOT A BATTLE AGAINST THE GREEK PEOPLE BUT AGAINST THAT ARCHENEMY ENGLAND WHICH IS AGAIN TRYING TO EXTEND THE WAR FAR INTO THE SOUTHEAST BALKANS THE SAME AS HE TRIED FAR IN THE NORTH LAST YEAR FOR THIS REASON ON THIS VERY SPOT IN THE BALKANS WE SHALL FIGHT SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH OUR ALLY UNTIL THE LAST BRITON HAS FOUND HIS DUNKERQUE IN GREECE IF ANY GREEKS SUPPORT THIS BRITISH COURSE THEN THOSE GREEKS WILL FALL AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BRITISH WHEN THE GERMAN SOLDIER SHALL HAVE PROVED HIMSELF SHALL HAVE PROVED THAT HE IS CAPABLE OF BEATING THE BRITISH IN THE BALKANS IN THE MIDST OF SNOW AND MOUNTAINS THEN ALSO HE WILL HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAN BEAT THE BRITISH IN THE HEAT OF THE DESERT IN AFRICA HOWEVER WE WILL PURSUE NO OTHER ULTIMATE AIM THAN TO WIN FREEDOM FOR OUR GERMAN PEOPLE AND TO SECURE A LIVING SPACE FOR THE GERMAN FAMILY THE PRAYERS AND THOUGHTS THE VERY LIFE OF ALL GERMANS ARE AGAIN IN THE HEART OF EVERY GERMAN SOLDIER BERLIN SPORTPALAST SPEECH OF APRIL 8 1933BERLIN SPORTPALASTSPEECH OF APRIL 8 1933THE GREAT EPOCH WHICH FOR FOURTEEN YEARS WE AWAITED HAS NOW BEGUN GERMANY IS AWAKE NOW I CAN SAY WITH PRIDE COMRADES OF THE SA AND SS THAT IF THE WHOLE GERMAN PEOPLE NOW WAS POSSESSED OF THE SPIRIT WHICH IS IN US AND IN YOU THEN GERMANY WOULD BE INDESTRUCTIBLE EVEN WITHOUT ARMS GERMANY WOULD REPRESENT AN UNHEARD OF STRENGTH THROUGH THIS INNER WILL TEMPERED LIKE STEEL IT IS TRUE THAT THIS EQUALITY WHICH IS REALIZED IN YOU WAS REALIZED ONLY AT THE COST OF THAT FREEDOM OF WHICH OTHERS SPOKE WE HAVE TOO ADOPTED THE PRINCIPLE OF LEADERSHIP THE CONCEPTION OF AUTHORITY THAT WAS A HEAVY SACRIFICE AT A TIME WHEN THE WHOLE PEOPLE WAS RUNNING AFTER THE ILLUSION OF DEMOCRACY AND PARLIAMENTARIANISM WHEN MILLIONS BELIEVED THAT THE MAJORITY WAS THE SOURCE OF A RIGHT DECISION IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT WE BEGAN RESOLUTELY TO BUILD UP AN ORGANIZATION IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT ONE DICTATOR BUT TEN THOUSAND WHEN OUR OPPONENTS SAY 'IT IS EASY FOR YOU YOU ARE A DICTATOR' WE ANSWER THEM 'NO GENTLEMEN YOU ARE WRONG THERE IS NO SINGLE DICTATOR BUT TEN THOUSAND EACH IN HIS OWN PLACE AND EVEN THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY IN THE HIERARCHY HAS ITSELF ONLY ONE WISH NEVER TO TRANSGRESS AGAINST THE SUPREME AUTHORITY TO WHICH IT TOO IS RESPONSIBLE WE HAVE IN OUR MOVEMENT DEVELOPED THIS LOYALTY IN FOLLOWING THE LEADER THIS BLIND OBEDIENCE OF WHICH ALL THE OTHERS KNOW NOTHING AND WHICH GAVE TO US THE POWER TO SURMOUNT EVERYTHING FOR FOURTEEN YEARS WE WERE ASSAILED THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO BEND AND BREAK US BY CUNNING CHICANERY AND VIOLENCE BY MALICE AND TERROR BY EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE BUT THIS INSTRUMENT OF BLIND OBEDIENCE REMAINED UNBROKEN REMAINED STEADFAST ALL WE ENDURED WAS BUT TESTS FROM WHICH WE EMERGED STRONGER THAN EVER IN ADDITION WE HAVE FOSTERED THE VIRTUE OF BRAVERY TODAY MILLIONS ARE POURING INTO OUR RANKS
BUT THE GREATER PART OF THEM MUST LEARN NOW WHAT THIS BROWN ARMY HAS PRACTICED FOR YEARS THEY MUST ALL LEARN TO FACE WHAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR COMRADES HAVE FACED AND HAVE PAID FOR WITH THEIR BLOOD THEIR LIVES WE HAVE SUCCEEDED OUT OF OUR OWN FREE WILLS IN ONCE MORE INCULCATING IN OUR PEOPLE THE COURAGE WHICH DARES TO ATTEMPT A TASK IN THE FACE OF A WORLD OF FOES WERE THE DISCIPLINE OF THIS MOVEMENT NOT SO FIRM THOSE WHO TODAY COMPLAIN OF THE SACRIFICES DEMANDED OF THEM WOULD HAVE EVEN MORE OF WHICH TO COMPLAIN FOR WHAT WE FIGHTERS HAVE GAINED DOES NOT COMPARE TO THE AMOUNT OF PERSECUTION WE SUFFERED LET THE BELLYACHERS REALIZE THAT WHEREVER THEY ARE THE MOVEMENT TRAINS ITSELF IN THIS PERFECT DISCIPLINE FOR THE SAKE OF GERMANY TO SAVE OUR PEOPLE FROM BEING CAST DOWN IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD TO THE LEVEL OF THEIR OPPONENTS WE HAVE ALSO UTILIZED THE VIRTUE OF PERSISTENCE OF UNWEARYING PATIENCE IT WAS THIS VIRTUE WHICH MADE YOU AND THEREFORE US UNCONQUERABLE AND WHICH SAVED THE NATION FOURTEEN YEARS OF STRUGGLE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH FATE HAD SAVED UP SO TERRIBLY MANY VICTIMS ESPECIALLY FOR THE LAST YEAR OF THE STRUGGLE OUR BROWN SHIRTS PROHIBITED THE MEMBERS TORTURED TERROR HEAPED UPON TERROR AND IN THE END THE DISSOLUTION OF THE ORGANIZATION IT WAS A TERRIBLY SAD TIME AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS FOR MANY TO KEEP THEIR FAITH THAT AFTER ALL THE HOUR WOULD COME AT LAST WE ALMOST DOUBTED JUSTICE AND PROVIDENCE THEN CAME THE TURNING POINT AND BATTLE AFTER BATTLE ONCE MORE MANY DOUBTED AND SOME EVEN WERE BEATEN DOWN BY THEIR DOUBT AND THEN CAME THE TIME WHEN WE HAD TO SAY 'NO WHEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IT SEEMED THAT THE WAY TO POWER WAS OPENING BEFORE US TEMPTING US AND YET DESPITE THIS WE HAD TO REMAIN HARD AND SAY 'NO IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THAT WAY AND FOR A SECOND TIME THE DOORS SEEMED TO OPEN AND FOR THE SECOND TIME WE HAD TO SAY 'NO IMPOSSIBLE AND THEN AT THE THIRD TIME THE HOUR CAME AND THAT WAS GIVEN TO US WHICH WE COULD NOT BUT DESIRE WHICH WE HAD A RIGHT TO DESIRE AND AT LAST THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST MOVEMENT ENTERED INTO THE GREAT PERIOD OF ITS HISTORIC ACTION WE HAVE NOW WON POWER IN GERMANY AND IT IS UP TO US TO WIN THE GERMAN PEOPLE TO INCORPORATE THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE POWER WE MUST BUILD THE MILLIONS OF OUR WORKING MEN OF ALL CLASSES INTO A CLOSE COMMUNITY THIS IS A STRUGGLE WHICH WILL AGAIN TAKE YEARS BUT IT IS NECESSARY IF THE 600 000 MEN OF TODAY ARE SOME DAY TO BE THE SIX EIGHT TEN MILLIONS WE NEED HERE TOO WE KNOW THAT IF WE REST WE RUST THAT IF WE STAND STILL WE WILL RETREAT IF IN THE FUTURE YOU CONTINUE TO STAND BEHIND ME AS ONE MAN IN LOYALTY AND OBEDIENCE NO POWER IN THE WORLD WILL BE ABLE TO DESTROY THIS MOVEMENT IT WILL CONTINUE ITS VICTORIOUS COURSE IF YOU PRESERVE THE SAME DISCIPLINE THE SAME OBEDIENCE THE SAME COMRADESHIP AND THE SAME UNBOUNDED LOYALTY IN THE FUTURE THEN NOTHING WILL EVER EXTINGUISH THIS MOVEMENT IN GERMANY THIS IS THE REQUEST I MAKE OF YOU FOR MYSELF AND IN THE NAME OF ALL THE COMRADES WHO ARE NO LONGER AMONG US OUR NATIONAL SOCIALIST MOVEMENT THE SA AND SS SIEG HEIL SIEG HEIL SIEG HEIL MUNICH SPEECH OF APRIL 10 1923MUNICHSPEECH OF APRIL 10 1923 IN THE BIBLE WE FIND THE TEXT 'THAT WHICH IS NEITHER HOT NOR COLD WILL I SPEW OUT OF MY MOUTH THIS UTTERANCE OF THE GREAT NAZARENE HAS KEPT ITS PROFOUND VALIDITY UNTIL THE PRESENT DAY HE WHO WOULD PURSUE THE GOLDEN MEAN MUST

PROFITEERS AND KNAVES ARE OF COURSE 'CITIZENS OF THE STATE AND WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT STILL THEY ARE ADHERENTS OF THE RELIGION WHICH IS HALLOWED BY THE TALMUD EVEN TODAY WE ARE THE LEAST LOVED PEOPLE ON EARTH A WORLD OF FOES IS RANGED AGAINST US AND THE GERMAN MUST STILL TODAY MAKE UP HIS MIND WHETHER HE INTENDS TO BE A FREE SOLDIER OR A WHITE SLAVE THE ONLY POSSIBLE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH A GERMAN STATE CAN DEVELOP AT ALL MUST THEREFORE BE THE UNIFICATION OF ALL GERMANS IN EUROPE EDUCATION TOWARDS A NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND READINESS TO PLACE THE WHOLE NATIONAL STRENGTH WITHOUT

WORLD IN THIS INDISSOLUBLE SWORN COMMUNITY AND THIS UNITED NATION WE HAVE NEED OF IT WHEN WAS A LEADERSHIP AT ANY TIME FACED WITH A HEAVIER TASK THAN OUR GERMAN LEADERSHIP CONSIDER MY COMRADES WHAT OUR GERMANY IS AND COMPARE IT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES WHAT HAVE WE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE TO THE SQUARE KILOMETER NO COLONIES NO RAW MATERIALS NO FOREIGN EXCHANGE NO CAPITAL NO LONGER ANY FOREIGN CREDITS ONLY HEAVY BURDENS SACRIFICES TAXATION AND LOW WAGES WHAT HAVE WE COMPARED WITH THE WEALTH OF OTHER STATES THE WEALTH OF OTHER COUNTRIES THE WEALTH OF OTHER PEOPLES WITH THE

BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE THE SAME MAN MAINTAINED MOREOVER THAT IT CONSISTED OF 240 000 MEN THE OBJECT OF THIS ARMY WAS TO ATTACK GERMANY FROM THE SOUTH INFLICT A DEFEAT UPON HER AND FROM THIS POINT AS IN 1918 TURN THE TIDE OF THE WAR I PROPHESIED MORE CORRECTLY THAN MR CHURCHILL IN MY LAST SPEECH IN WHICH I ANNOUNCED THAT WHEREVER THE BRITISH MIGHT SET FOOT ON THE CONTINENT THEY WOULD BE ATTACKED BY US AND DRIVEN INTO THE SEA NOW WITH HIS BRAZEN EFFRONTERY HE ASSERTS THAT THIS WAR HAS COST US 75 000 LIVES HE CAUSES HIS PRESUMABLY NOT OVERINTELLIGENT FELLOW COUNTRYMEN TO BE INFORMED BY ONE OF HIS PAID CREATURES THAT THE BRITISH AFTER HAVING SLAIN ENORMOUS MASSES OF GERMANS FINALLY TURNED AWAY FROM SHEER ABHORRENCE OF THE SLAUGHTER AND STRICTLY SPEAKING WITHDREW FOR THIS REASON ALONE I WILL NOW PRESENT TO YOU THE RESULTS OF THIS CAMPAIGN IN A FEW SHORT FIGURES IN THE COURSE OF THE OPERATIONS AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA THERE WERE THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS OF PURELY SERBIAN PRISONERS LEAVING OUT SOLDIERS OF GERMAN ORIGIN AND SOME OTHER GROUPS 6 198 OFFICERS 313 864 MEN THE NUMBER OF GREEK PRISONERS 8 000 OFFICERS AND 210 000 MEN HAS NOT THE SAME SIGNIFICANCE THE NUMBER OF ENGLISHMEN NEW ZEALANDERS AND AUSTRALIANS TAKEN PRISONER EXCEEDS 9 000 OFFICERS AND MEN THE GERMAN SHARE OF THE BOOTY ALONE ACCORDING TO THE ESTIMATES AT PRESENT AVAILABLE AMOUNTS TO MORE THAN HALF A MILLION RIFLES FAR MORE THAN 1 000 GUNS MANY THOUSAND MACHINE GUNS AND ANTI AIRCRAFT MACHINE GUNS VEHICLES AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF AMMUNITION THE LOSSES OF THE GERMAN ARMY AND THE GERMAN AIR FORCE AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE SS TROOPS IN THIS CAMPAIGN ARE THE SMALLEST THAT WE HAVE EVER SUFFERED SO FAR THE GERMAN ARMED FORCES HAVE IN FIGHTING AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA AND GREECE AS WELL AS AGAINST THE BRITISH IN GREECE LOST ARMY AND SS TROOPS FIFTY SEVEN OFFICERS AND 1 042 NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND MEN KILLED 181 OFFICERS AND 3 571 NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND MEN WOUNDED AND 13 OFFICERS AND 372 NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND MEN MISSING AIR FORCE TEN OFFICERS AND 42 NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND MEN KILLED AND 36 OFFICERS AND 104 NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND MEN MISSING ONCE MORE I CAN ONLY REPEAT THAT WE FEEL THE HARDSHIP OF THE SACRIFICE BORNE BY THE FAMILIES CONCERNED THE ENTIRE GERMAN NATION EXPRESSES TO THEM ITS HEARTFELT GRATITUDE TAKING THE MEASURES AS A WHOLE HOWEVER THE LOSSES SUFFERED ARE SO SMALL THAT THEY CONSTITUTE SUPREME JUSTIFICATION FIRST FOR THE PLANNING AND TIMING OF THIS CAMPAIGN SECOND FOR THE CONDUCT OF OPERATIONS THIRD FOR THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE CARRIED THROUGH THE TRAINING OF OUR OFFICERS IS EXCELLENT BEYOND COMPARISON THE HIGH STANDARD OF EFFICIENCY OF OUR SOLDIERS THE SUPERIORITY OF OUR EQUIPMENT THE QUALITY OF OUR MUNITIONS AND THE INDOMITABLE COURAGE OF ALL RANKS HAVE COMBINED TO LEAD AT SUCH SMALL SACRIFICE TO A SUCCESS OF TRULY DECISIVE HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE CHURCHILL ONE OF THE MOST HOPELESS DABBLERS IN STRATEGY THUS MANAGED TO LOSE TWO THEATERS OF WAR AT ONE SINGLE BLOW THE FACT THAT THIS MAN WHO IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY WOULD BE COURT MARTIALED GAINED FRESH ADMIRATION AS PRIME MINISTER CANNOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN EXPRESSION OF MAGNANIMITY SUCH AS WAS ACCORDED BY ROMAN SENATORS TO GENERALS HONORABLY DEFEATED IN BATTLE IT IS MERELY PROOF OF THAT PERPETUAL BLINDNESS WITH WHICH THE GODS AFFLICT THOSE WHOM THEY ARE ABOUT TO DESTROY THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CAMPAIGN ARE EXTRAORDINARY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT A SMALL SET OF CONSPIRATORS IN BELGRADE AGAIN WERE ABLE TO FOMENT TROUBLE IN THE SERVICE OF EXTRACONTINENTAL INTERESTS THE RADICAL ELIMINATION OF THIS DANGER MEANS THE REMOVAL OF AN ELEMENT OF TENSION FOR THE WHOLE OF EUROPE THE DANUBE AS AN IMPORTANT WATERWAY IS THUS SAFEGUARDED AGAINST ANY FURTHER ACT OF SABOTAGE TRAFFIC HAS BEEN RESUMED IN FULL APART FROM THE MODEST CORRECTION OF ITS FRONTIERS WHICH WERE INFRINGED AS A RESULT OF THE OUTCOME OF THE WORLD WAR THE REICH HAS NO SPECIAL TERRITORIAL INTERESTS IN THESE PARTS AS FAR AS POLITICS ARE CONCERNED WE ARE MERELY INTERESTED IN SAFEGUARDING PEACE IN THIS REGION WHILE IN THE REALM OF ECONOMICS WE WISH TO SEE AN ORDER THAT WILL ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS TO BE DEVELOPED AND THE EXCHANGE OF PRODUCTS TO BE RESUMED IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL IT IS HOWEVER ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUPREME JUSTICE IF THOSE INTERESTS ARE ALSO TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THAT ARE FOUNDED UPON ETHNOGRAPHICAL HISTORICAL OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I LOOK INTO THE FUTURE WITH PERFECT TRANQUILLITY AND GREAT CONFIDENCE THE GERMAN REICH AND ITS ALLIES REPRESENT POWER MILITARY ECONOMIC AND ABOVE ALL IN MORAL RESPECTS WHICH IS SUPERIOR TO ANY POSSIBLE COALITION IN THE WORLD THE GERMAN ARMED FORCES WILL ALWAYS DO THEIR PART WHENEVER IT MAY BE NECESSARY THE CONFIDENCE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS ACCOMPANY THEIR SOLDIERS BERLIN CONGRESS OF THE GERMAN WORK FRONT SPEECH OF MAY 10 1933BERLIN CONGRESS OF THE GERMAN WORK FRONTSPEECH OF MAY 10 1933 AMIDST ALL THE CRISES UNDER WHICH WE SUFFER AND WHICH DO BUT PRESENT A SINGLE CONNECTED PICTURE PERHAPS THAT WHICH THE PEOPLE FEELS MOST ACUTELY IS THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THE POLITICAL CRISIS THE MORAL CRISIS ARE ONLY VERY RARELY FELT BY THE INDIVIDUAL THE AVERAGE MAN SEES IN THE EXPERIENCES OF HIS DAY NOT THAT WHICH AFFECTS THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE BUT FOR THE MOST PART ONLY THAT WHICH STRIKES HIMSELF
THEREFORE THE PRESENT HAS ONLY VERY RARELY ANY CONSCIOUSNESS OF POLITICAL OR MORAL COLLAPSE SO LONG AS THIS COLLAPSE DOES NOT EXTEND IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER INTO ECONOMIC LIFE FOR WHEN THIS HAPPENS IT IS NO LONGER A QUESTION OF SOME ABSTRACT PROBLEM THAT CAN PERHAPS BE OBSERVED OR STUDIED IN ITS EFFECT ON OTHERS BUT ONE DAY THE INDIVIDUAL HIMSELF WILL BE CAUGHT HOLD OF BY THIS QUESTION AND THE MORE INTIMATELY SUCH A CRISIS BEGINS TO INFLUENCE HIS OWN LIFE THE MORE CLEARLY DOES HE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT EXISTING CONDITIONS CANNOT REMAIN AS THEY ARE THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE TALK OF ECONOMIC DISTRESS OF ECONOMIC MISERY AND THEN STARTING FROM THIS DISTRESS ONE CAN AWAKEN AN UNDERSTANDING FOR THAT OTHER DISTRESS WHICH OTHERWISE IS WONT TO REMAIN FOR A LONG TIME HIDDEN FROM THE INDIVIDUAL MAN IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THE GERMAN ECONOMIC DISTRESS IS A PHENOMENON RESULTING FROM A WORLD CRISIS FROM A GENERAL ECONOMIC DISTRESS SINCE OF COURSE EXACTLY IN THE SAME WAY EVERY OTHER PEOPLE COULD PLEAD THE SAME EXCUSE COULD ADDUCE THE SAME REASON IT IS CLEAR THAT EVEN SO THIS DISTRESS CANNOT HAVE ITS ROOTS ALL OVER THE WORLD THOSE ROOTS MUST ALWAYS BE FOUND WITHIN THE LIFE OF PEOPLES AND THOUGH ONLY ONE THING IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT THESE ROOTS ARE PERHAPS THE SAME IN THE CASE OF MANY PEOPLES YET ONE CANNOT HOPE TO MASTER THIS DISTRESS BY THE MERE STATEMENT THAT THE PRESENCE OF A CERTAIN DISTRESS IS A FEATURE OF THE AGE RATHER IT IS CLEARLY A NECESSITY TO DISCLOSE THESE ROOTS IN THE INTERNAL LIFE OF A SINGLE PEOPLE AND TO CURE THE DISTRESS THERE WHERE ONE CAN REALLY EFFECT A CURE UNFORTUNATELY IT IS PRECISELY THE GERMAN WHO IS ONLY TOO INCLINED AT SUCH TIMES INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HIS OWN INTERNAL LIFE TO LET HIS GAZE RANGE INTO THE FAR DISTANCE OUR PEOPLE HAS BEEN SO LONG FALSELY TAUGHT TO THINK IN INTERNATIONAL TERMS THAT EVEN IN SUCH A DISTRESS AS THE PRESENT IT TENDS TO TREAT THIS PROBLEM TOO FROM INTERNATIONAL POINTS OF VIEW AND THE RESULT IS THAT MANY OF US SIMPLY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO REMEDY SUCH A MISFORTUNE IN SOME OTHER WAY THAN BY INTERNATIONAL METHODS AND YET THAT IS AN ERROR IT IS NATURAL THAT INTERNATIONAL INFIRMITIES WHICH AFFLICT ALL PEOPLES IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER MUST BE REMOVED BY THE PEOPLES WHO SUFFER FROM THEM BUT THAT IN NO WAY ALTERS THE FACT THAT EVERY PEOPLE MUST WAGE THIS BATTLE ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ABOVE ALL THAT NO SINGLE PEOPLE CAN BE LIBERATED FROM THIS DISTRESS BY INTERNATIONAL METHODS IF IT DOES NOT FOR ITS OWN PART TAKE THE NECESSARY MEASURES THESE MEASURES CAN OF COURSE FIND THEIR PLACE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL MEASURES BUT ONE'S OWN ACTION MUST NOT BE MADE DEPENDENT UPON THE ACTION OF OTHERS THE CRISIS IN GERMAN ECONOMICS IS NOT MERELY A CRISIS WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY OUR ECONOMIC STATISTICS BUT IT IS ABOVE ALL A CRISIS WHICH CAN ALSO BE TRACED IN THE INTERNAL COURSE OF OUR ECONOMIC LIFE IN THE CHARACTER OF ITS ORGANIZATION ETC AND HERE WE CAN INDEED SPEAK OF A CRISIS WHICH HAS HIT OUR PEOPLE MORE SEVERELY THAN OTHER PEOPLES IT IS THE CRISIS WHICH WE SEE IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN CAPITAL ECONOMICS AND PEOPLE THIS CRISIS IS PARTICULARLY OBVIOUS IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR WORKMEN AND THE EMPLOYERS HERE THE CRISIS HAS BEEN MORE ACUTE THAN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THE FIRST CAUSE LIES IN THE ALTERATION IN THE FORM OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATION WHICH DETERMINED THE CHARACTER OF OUR ECONOMICS THAT CAUSE MAY BE TRACED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD PRECISELY AS IN GERMANY THE GRADUAL ALIENATION OF CLASSES WHICH WE IN GERMANY EXPERIENCED LED TO THE APPEARANCE ON THE ONE SIDE OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS OF THE EMPLOYERS AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS OF THE EMPLOYED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF OUR UNHAPPY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHEN ONE HAD ONCE STARTED ON THIS ROAD OF NECESSITY THE TWO SIDES BECAME EVER MORE WIDELY SEPARATED HERE A LAW GOVERNS HUMAN AFFAIRS WHEN ONE HAS ONCE CHOSEN THE WRONG ROAD THIS ROAD ALWAYS LEADS ONE FURTHER FROM REASON ON THE CONTRARY THE ROAD LED NECESSARILY TO FURTHER ALIENATION AND THIS TENDENCY AS I SAID WAS FAVORED BY THE DEPERSONALIZATION OF PROPERTY AND I MIGHT ALMOST SAY THAT THIS PROCESS WAS APPARENTLY STILL FURTHER ENCOURAGED AND STRENGTHENED ON SCIENTIFIC GROUNDS THERE GRADUALLY AROSE AN IDEOLOGY WHICH BELIEVED THAT IT COULD PERMANENTLY SUPPORT THE CONCEPTION OF PROPERTY EVEN THOUGH THOSE WHO DERIVED ANY PRACTICAL PROFIT FROM THE CONCEPTION NO LONGER REPRESENTED MORE THAN A MINIMAL PERCENTAGE OF THE NATION AND ON THE OTHER HAND THERE AROSE THE VIEW THAT SINCE THERE WAS NOW ONLY SO SMALL A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WHO ENJOYED PROPERTY THE CONCEPTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AS SUCH SHOULD BE ABANDONED WHEN ONE HAS ONCE STARTED ON THIS COURSE THEN LOGICALLY THE EMPLOYERS WILL IN TURN FORM THEIR ORGANIZATION AND AS A MATTER OF COURSE THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS WILL NOT PURSUE THEIR OWN ENDS IN MUTUAL TOLERATION BUT THEY WILL MAINTAIN THEIR APPARENTLY SEPARATE INTERESTS WITH THOSE WEAPONS WHICH ARE GIVEN THEM VIZ LOCKOUTS AND STRIKES IN THIS WARFARE SOMETIMES ONE AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER SIDE WILL CONQUER BUT IN EITHER CASE IT IS THE WHOLE NATION WHICH WILL HAVE TO PAY THE COST OF THIS WARFARE AND SUFFER THE DAMAGE AND THE FINAL RESULT OF THIS DEVELOPMENT IS THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS AS THEY BUILD THEMSELVES UP CONSIDERING THE PASSION OF THE GERMAN FOR BUREAUCRATIZATION WILL CONTINUOUSLY BECOME MORE UNWIELDY AND THEIR PERSONNEL WILL GROW CONSTANTLY LARGER AND AT LENGTH THE ORGANIZATION WILL NO LONGER SERVE THE INTERESTS OF ITS CREATORS BUT THESE WILL BE SUBSERVIENT TO THE ORGANIZATION SO THAT THE WARFARE IS CONTINUED IN ORDER THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ORGANIZATION MAY BE JUSTIFIED EVEN THOUGH AT TIMES REASON SUDDENLY COMES AND SAYS 'THE WHOLE AFFAIR IS MADNESS THE GAIN WHEN COMPARED WITH THE SACRIFICES IS POSITIVELY LUDICROUS IF YOU RECKON UP THE SACRIFICES WHICH WE MAKE FOR THE ORGANIZATION THEY ARE FAR GREATER THAN ANY POSSIBLE PROFIT THEN THE
ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR TURN WILL HAVE TO PROVE HOW NECESSARY THEY ARE BY STIRRING UP THE PARTIES TO FIGHT EACH OTHER AND THEN IT MAY EVEN BE THAT THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WHEN ONCE THEY HAVE REALIZED THE SITUATION THE SECOND REASON IS THE RISE OF MARXISM MARXISM AS A CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD WITH DISINTEGRATION FOR ITS AIM SAW WITH KEEN INSIGHT THAT THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT OFFERED IT THE POSSIBILITY IN THE FUTURE OF CONDUCTING ITS ATTACK AGAINST THE STATE AND AGAINST HUMAN SOCIETY WITH AN ABSOLUTELY ANNIHILATING WEAPON NOT WITH ANY IDEA OF HELPING THE WORKER WHAT IS THE WORKER OF ANY COUNTRY TO THESE APOSTLES OF INTERNATIONALISM NOTHING AT ALL THEY NEVER SEE HIM THEY THEMSELVES ARE NO WORKERS THEY ARE ALIEN LITTERATEURS AN ALIEN GANG ONE HAD TO INOCULATE THE TRADE UNION WITH THE IDEA YOU ARE AN INSTRUMENT OF THE CLASS WAR AND THAT WAR IN THE LAST RESORT CAN FIND ITS POLITICAL LEADERS ONLY IN MARXISM WHAT IS THEN MORE COMPREHENSIBLE THAN THAT ONE SHOULD ALSO PAY ONE'S TRIBUTE TO THE LEADERSHIP AND THE TRIBUTE WAS EXACTED IN FULL MEASURE THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE NOT BEEN CONTENT WITH A TITHE THEY DEMANDED A CONSIDERABLY HIGHER RATE OF INTEREST THIS CLASS WAR LEADS TO THE PROCLAMATION OF THE TRADE UNION AS SIMPLY AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF THE WORKING CLASSES AND THEREWITH FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL STRIKE THUS THE GENERAL STRIKE APPEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME AS A MEANS FOR EXERCISING POLITICAL POWER AND SHOWS WHAT MARXISM REALLY HOPED TO GAIN FROM THIS WEAPON NOT A MEANS FOR THE SALVATION OF THE WORKER BUT ON THE CONTRARY ONLY AN INSTRUMENT OF WAR FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE STATE WHICH OPPOSED MARXISM TO PROVE TO WHAT LENGTHS THIS WHOLE MADNESS COULD GO WE GERMANS HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED EXAMPLE AS FRIGHTFUL AS IT IS INSTRUCTIVE IN THE WAR WE CAN ADD ONLY ONE REMARK HAD THE GERMAN TRADE UNIONS BEEN IN OUR HANDS DURING THE WAR IF THEY HAD BEEN IN MY HANDS AND HAD THEY BEEN TRAINED WITH THE SAME FALSE END IN VIEW AS WAS IN FACT THE CASE THEN WE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS WOULD HAVE PLACED THE WHOLE OF THIS GIGANTIC ORGANIZATION AT THE SERVICE OF THE FATHERLAND WE SHOULD HAVE DECLARED WE RECOGNIZE OF COURSE THE SACRIFICES ENTAILED WE ARE READY OURSELVES TO MAKE THOSE SACRIFICES WE DO NOT WISH TO ESCAPE WE WANT TO FIGHT WITH YOU ON THE SAME TERMS WE GIVE OUR DESTINY AND OUR LIFE INTO THE HAND OF ALMIGHTY PROVIDENCE JUST AS THE OTHERS MUST DO THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE AS A MATTER OF COURSE FOR GERMAN WORKMEN WE SHOULD HAVE SAID YOU MUST REALIZE IT IS NOT THE FATE OF THE GERMAN STATE WHICH IS NOW TO BE DECIDED NOT OF THE EMPIRE AS A CONSTITUTIONAL FORM NOT OF THE MONARCHY IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF CAPITALISM OR MILITARISM IT IS THE EXISTENCE OF OUR PEOPLE WHICH IS AT STAKE AND WE GERMAN WORKMEN MAKE UP SEVENTY PER CENT OF THIS PEOPLE IT IS OUR FATE WHICH IS TO BE DECIDED THAT IS WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN THEN AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT IT WAS A CRIME THAT THIS WAS NOT DONE IT WAS NOT DONE BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE VIOLATED THE INNER MEANING OF MARXISM FOR MARXISM WANTED ONLY THE DESTRUCTION OF GERMANY FOR SINCE THE DAYS OF NOVEMBER 1918 MILLIONS OF GERMANS HAVE HELD THE VIEW THAT IT WAS THE FAULT OF THE GERMAN WORKINGMAN WHICH CAUSED THE COUNTRY'S COLLAPSE HE WHO HIMSELF HAD MADE SUCH UNSPEAKABLE SACRIFICES HE WHO HAD FILLED OUR REGIMENTS WITH THE MILLIONS OF THEIR RIFLEMEN HE AS A CLASS WAS SUDDENLY MADE COLLECTIVELY LIABLE FOR THE ACT OF THE PERJURED LYING DEGENERATE DESTROYERS OF THE FATHERLAND THAT WAS THE WORST THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED FOR AT THAT MOMENT FOR MANY MILLIONS IN GERMANY THE COMMUNITY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SHATTERED THE THIRD CAUSE OF THIS FATAL DEVELOPMENT LAY IN THE STATE ITSELF THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING WHICH COULD PERHAPS HAVE OPPOSED THESE MILLIONS AND THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAVE BEEN THE STATE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT THIS STATE HAD SUNK SO LOW THAT IT HAD BECOME THE PLAYTHING OF GROUPS OF INTERESTED PARTIES IT IS NO MERE CHANCE THAT THIS WHOLE DEVELOPMENT RUNS PARALLEL WITH THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF OUR PUBLIC LIFE THIS DEMOCRATIZATION TENDED TO BRING THE STATE DIRECTLY INTO THE HANDS OF CERTAIN STRATA OF SOCIETY WHICH IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES WITH PROPERTY AS SUCH WITH BIG BUSINESS AS SUCH THE MASSES INCREASINGLY GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THE STATE ITSELF WAS NO OBJECTIVE INSTITUTION STANDING ABOVE PARTIES THAT IN PARTICULAR IT WAS NO LONGER THE INCORPORATION OF ANY OBJECTIVE AUTHORITY BUT THAT IT WAS ITSELF THE MOUTHPIECE OF THE ECONOMIC WILL AND OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF CERTAIN GROUPS WITHIN THE NATION AND THAT EVEN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE JUSTIFIED SUCH AN ASSUMPTION THE VICTORY OF THE POLITICAL BOURGEOISIE WAS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE VICTORY OF A STRATUM OF SOCIETY WHICH HAD ARISEN AS THE RESULT OF ECONOMIC LAWS WHILE IT IS NATURAL THAT AMONGST SOLDIERS HE ONLY CAN BE A LEADER WHO HAS BEEN TRAINED FOR THAT POST IT WAS BY NO MEANS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT ONLY HE SHOULD BE A POLITICAL LEADER WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED IN THAT SPHERE AND HAD BESIDES PROVED HIS CAPACITY GRADUALLY THE VIEW GAINED GROUND THAT MEMBERSHIP OF A CERTAIN CLASS WHICH HAD ARISEN AS THE RESULT OF ECONOMIC LAWS CARRIED WITH IT THE CAPACITY TO GOVERN A PEOPLE WE HAVE COME TO REALIZE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ERROR THE STRATUM OF SOCIETY WHICH CLAIMED FOR ITSELF THE LEADERSHIP HAS FAILED US IN EVERY HOUR OF CRISIS AND IN THE NATION'S HOUR OF SUPREME DIFFICULTY IT COLLAPSED MISERABLY LET NO ONE SAY TO ME 'NO OTHER COURSE WAS POSSIBLE IT WAS ONLY FOR THESE LEADERS THAT NO OTHER COURSE WAS POSSIBLE WE MUST PENETRATE TO THE INNER CAUSES OF THE COLLAPSE WITH THE RESOLUTION THAT THESE INNER CAUSES SHALL BE REMOVED I BELIEVE THAT IMMEDIATELY WE MUST BEGIN AT THE POINT WHERE IN THE LAST RESORT A BEGINNING MUST TODAY BE MADE WE MUST BEGIN WITH THE STATE ITSELF A NEW AUTHORITY MUST BE SET UP AND THIS AUTHORITY MUST BE INDEPENDENT OF MOMENTARY CURRENTS OF CONTEMPORARY OPINION ESPECIALLY OF THOSE CURRENTS WHICH FLOW FROM A NARROW AND LIMITED ECONOMIC EGOISM THERE MUST BE CONSTITUTED A LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE WHICH REPRESENTS A REAL AUTHORITY AN AUTHORITY INDEPENDENT OF ANY ONE STRATUM OF SOCIETY
A LEADERSHIP MUST ARISE IN WHICH EVERY CITIZEN CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE ASSURED THAT ITS SOLE AIM IS THE HAPPINESS THE WELFARE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE A LEADERSHIP WHICH CAN WITH JUSTICE SAY OF ITSELF THAT IT IS ON EVERY SIDE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT PEOPLE HAVE TALKED SO MUCH OF THE PAST AGE OF ABSOLUTISM OF THE ABSOLUTISM OF FREDERICK THE GREAT AND OF THE AGE OF POPULAR DEMOCRACY OUR PARLIAMENTARY EPOCH REGARDED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PEOPLE THE EARLIER PERIOD WAS THE MORE OBJECTIVE IT COULD REALLY MORE OBJECTIVELY SAFEGUARD THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION WHILE THE LATER PERIOD CONTINUOUSLY DESCENDED MORE AND MORE TO THE REPRESENTATION MERELY OF THE INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUAL CLASSES NOTHING CAN PROVE THAT MORE CLEARLY THAN THE MERE CONCEPTION OF A CLASS WAR THE SLOGAN THAT THE RULE OF THE BOURGEOISIE MUST BE REPLACED BY THE RULE OF THE PROLETARIAT THAT MEANS THAT THE WHOLE QUESTION BECOMES ONE OF A CHANGE IN A CLASS DICTATORSHIP WHILE OUR AIM IS THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PEOPLE I E THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE THE COMMUNITY AND FURTHER IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ONE SHOULD SWEEP AWAY ALL THOSE FORCES WHICH CONSCIOUSLY ABUSE HUMAN WEAKNESSES IN ORDER WITH THEIR HELP TO CARRY INTO EXECUTION THEIR DEADLY SCHEMES WHEN FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SINCE THEN I DECLARED BEFORE THE GERMAN NATION THAT I SAW MY TASK BEFORE THE BAR OF GERMAN HISTORY TO LIE IN THE DESTRUCTION OF MARXISM THAT WAS FOR ME NO EMPTY PHRASE THAT WAS A SACRED OATH WHICH I WILL KEEP SO LONG AS I DRAW BREATH THIS CONFESSION OF FAITH THE CONFESSION OF FAITH OF AN INDIVIDUAL THROUGH MY EFFORT HAS BECOME THE CONFESSION OF FAITH OF A MIGHTY ORGANIZATION WE MUST ACCORDINGLY WAGE OUR BATTLE WITHOUT ANY COMPROMISE WHATSOEVER AGAINST THE FORCE WHICH HAS EATEN AT THE HEART OF OUR GERMAN PEOPLE DURING THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS WHICH HAS INFLICTED ON US SUCH FEARFUL INJURIES AND WHICH IF IT HAD NOT BEEN CONQUERED WOULD HAVE DESTROYED GERMANY BISMARCK ONCE DECLARED THAT LIBERALISM WAS THE PACEMAKER FOR SOCIAL DEMOCRACY AND I DO NOT NEED IN THIS PLACE TO SAY THAT SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IS THE PACEMAKER FOR COMMUNISM BUT COMMUNISM IS THE PACEMAKER FOR DEATH THE DEATH OF A PEOPLE DOWNFALL WE HAVE BEGUN THE FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM AND WE SHALL WAGE IT TO THE END AS SO OFTEN IN GERMAN HISTORY IT WILL ONCE MORE BE PROVED THAT THE GREATER THE DISTRESS THE GREATER IS THE POWER OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE TO FIND ITS WAY UPWARDS AND FORWARDS THIS TIME TOO IT WILL FIND THE WAY INDEED I AM CONVINCED THAT IT HAS ALREADY FOUND IT THUS THE UNIFICATION OF THE GERMAN WORKMEN'S MOVEMENT HAS A GREAT MORAL SIGNIFICANCE WHEN WE COMPLETE THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE STATE WHICH MUST BE THE RESULT OF VERY GREAT CONCESSIONS ON BOTH SIDES WE WANT TO HAVE TWO PARTIES TO THE CONTRACT FACING EACH OTHER WHO BOTH ARE IN THEIR HEARTS ON PRINCIPLE NATIONALLY MINDED WHO BOTH LOOK ONLY TO THEIR PEOPLE AND WHO BOTH ON PRINCIPLE ARE READY TO SUBORDINATE EVERYTHING ELSE IN ORDER TO SERVE THE COMMON WEAL ONLY IF THAT IS POSSIBLE FROM THE FIRST CAN I BELIEVE IN THE SUCCESS OF OUR EFFORTS IT IS THE SPIRIT FROM WHICH EFFORTS SPRING THAT HELPS TO DECIDE THE ISSUE THERE MUST BE NO CONQUERORS AND NO CONQUERED OUR PEOPLE MUST BE THE ONLY CONQUEROR CONQUEROR OVER CLASSES AND CASTES AND CONQUEROR OVER THE INTERESTS OF THESE SINGLE GROUPS IN OUR PEOPLE AND THEREBY WE SHALL COME NATURALLY TO A NOBLER CONCEPTION OF WORK BUT THE MOVEMENT WHICH I AND MY FELLOW FIGHTERS REPRESENT WILL NOTHING DAUNTED EXALT THE WORD 'WORKER' TILL IT BECOMES THE GREAT TITLE OF HONOR OF THE GERMAN NATION PERSONALLY I AM AGAINST ALL HONORARY TITLES AND I DO NOT THINK THAT ANYONE HAS MUCH TO ACCUSE ME OF ON THIS SCORE WHAT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR ME TO DO THAT I DO NOT DO I SHOULD NEVER CARE TO HAVE VISITING CARDS PRINTED WITH THE TITLES WHICH IN THIS EARTHLY WORLD OF OURS ARE GIVEN WITH SUCH CEREMONY I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING ON MY GRAVESTONE BUT MY NAME ALL THE SAME OWING TO THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY LIFE I AM PERHAPS MORE CAPABLE THAN ANYONE ELSE OF UNDERSTANDING AND REALIZING THE NATURE AND THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE VARIOUS GERMAN CASTES NOT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOOK DOWN ON THIS LIFE FROM ABOVE BUT BECAUSE I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN IT BECAUSE I STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THIS LIFE BECAUSE FATE IN A MOMENT OF CAPRICE OR PERHAPS FULFILLING THE DESIGNS OF PROVIDENCE CAST ME INTO THE GREAT MASS OF THE PEOPLE AMONGST COMMON FOLK BECAUSE I MYSELF WAS A LABORING MAN FOR YEARS IN THE BUILDING TRADE AND HAD TO EARN MY OWN BREAD AND BECAUSE FOR A SECOND TIME I TOOK MY PLACE ONCE AGAIN AS AN ORDINARY SOLDIER AMONGST THE MASSES AND BECAUSE THEN LIFE RAISED ME INTO OTHER STRATA OF OUR PEOPLE SO THAT I KNOW THESE TOO BETTER THAN COUNTLESS OTHERS WHO WERE BORN IN THESE STRATA SO FATE HAS PERHAPS FITTED ME MORE THAN ANY OTHER TO BE THE BROKER I THINK I MAY SAY THE HONEST BROKER FOR BOTH SIDES ALIKE HERE I AM NOT PERSONALLY INTERESTED I AM NOT DEPENDENT UPON THE STATE OR ON ANY PUBLIC OFFICE I AM NOT DEPENDENT UPON BUSINESS OR INDUSTRY OR ANY TRADE UNION I AM AN INDEPENDENT MAN AND I HAVE SET BEFORE MYSELF NO OTHER GOAL THAN TO SERVE TO THE BEST OF MY POWER AND ABILITY THE GERMAN PEOPLE AND ABOVE ALL TO SERVE THE MILLIONS WHO THANKS TO THEIR SIMPLE TRUST AND IGNORANCE AND THANKS TO THE BASENESS OF THEIR FORMER LEADERS HAVE PERHAPS SUFFERED MORE THAN ANY OTHER CLASS I HAVE ALWAYS PROFESSED THAT THERE IS NOTHING FINER THAN TO BE THE ADVOCATE OF THOSE WHO CANNOT EASILY DEFEND THEMSELVES I KNOW THE MASSES OF MY PEOPLE AND THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WHICH I SHOULD ALWAYS WISH TO SAY TO OUR INTELLECTUALS EVERY REICH THAT IS FOUNDED ONLY ON THE CLASSES WHICH REPRESENT INTELLECT AND INTELLIGENCE HAS WEAK FOUNDATIONS
I KNOW THIS INTELLECT ALWAYS SO SUBTLE ALWAYS INQUIRING BUT ALSO ALWAYS UNCERTAIN ALWAYS HESITATING VACILLATING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEVER STEADFAST HE WHO WOULD CONSTRUCT A REICH ON THESE INTELLECTUAL CLASSES ALONE WILL FIND HIS BUILDING INSECURE IT IS NO CHANCE THAT RELIGIONS ARE MORE STABLE THAN CONSTITUTIONAL FORMS GENERALLY THEY TEND TO SINK THEIR ROOTS DEEPER INTO THE SOIL THEY WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE IN THE ABSENCE OF THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW THAT THE INTELLECTUAL CLASSES FALL ALL TOO EASILY A VICTIM TO THAT ARROGANCE WHICH MEASURES THE PEOPLE ACCORDING TO THE STANDARDS OF ITS KNOWLEDGE AND OF ITS SO CALLED INTELLIGENCE AND YET THERE ARE THINGS IN THE PEOPLE WHICH VERY OFTEN THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE 'INTELLIGENT' DOES NOT SEE BECAUSE IT CANNOT SEE THEM THE MASSES ARE CERTAINLY OFTEN DULL IN MANY RESPECTS THEY ARE CERTAINLY BACKWARD THEY ARE NOT SO NIMBLE SO WITTY OR INTELLECTUAL BUT THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO THEIR CREDIT THEY HAVE LOYALTY CONSTANCY STABILITY BECAUSE I KNOW THIS PEOPLE BETTER THAN ANY OTHER AND AT THE SAME TIME KNOW THE REST OF THE PEOPLE I AM NOT ONLY READY IN THIS CASE TO UNDERTAKE THE ROLE OF AN HONEST BROKER BUT I AM GLAD THAT DESTINY CAN CAST ME FOR THE PART I SHALL NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE ANY GREATER REASON FOR PRIDE THAN WHEN AT THE END OF MY DAYS I CAN SAY I HAVE WON THE GERMAN WORKINGMAN FOR THE GERMAN REICH MUNICH SPEECH OF JULY 28 1922MUNICHSPEECH OF JULY 28 1922 IT IS A BATTLE WHICH BEGAN NEARLY 120 YEARS AGO AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE JEW WAS GRANTED CITIZEN RIGHTS IN THE EUROPEAN STATES THE POLITICAL EMANCIPATION OF THE JEWS WAS THE BEGINNING OF AN ATTACK OF DELIRIUM FOR THEREBY THEY WERE GIVEN FULL CITIZEN RIGHTS AND EQUALITY TO A PEOPLE WHICH WAS MUCH MORE CLEARLY AND DEFINITELY A RACE APART THAN ALL OTHERS THAT HAS ALWAYS FORMED AND WILL FORM A STATE WITHIN THE STATE THAT DID NOT HAPPEN PERHAPS AT ONE BLOW BUT IT CAME ABOUT AS THINGS COME ABOUT TODAY AND ALWAYS DO COME ABOUT FIRST A LITTLE FINGER THEN A SECOND AND A THIRD AND SO BIT BY BIT UNTIL AT LAST A PEOPLE THAT IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY STILL APPEARED COMPLETELY ALIEN HAD WON EQUAL CITIZEN RIGHTS WITH OURSELVES AND IT WAS PRECISELY THE SAME IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE THE VAST PROCESS OF THE INDUSTRIALIZATION OF THE PEOPLES MEANT THE CONFLUENCE OF GREAT MASSES OF WORKMEN IN THE TOWNS THUS GREAT HORDES OF PEOPLE AROSE AND THESE MORE'S THE PITY WERE NOT PROPERLY DEALT WITH BY THOSE WHOSE MORAL DUTY IT WAS TO CONCERN THEMSELVES FOR THEIR WELFARE PARALLEL WITH THIS WAS A GRADUAL 'MONEYFICATION' OF THE WHOLE OF THE NATION'S LABOR STRENGTH 'SHARE CAPITAL' WAS IN THE ASCENDANT AND THUS BIT BY BIT THE STOCK EXCHANGE CAME TO CONTROL THE WHOLE NATIONAL ECONOMY THE DIRECTORS OF THESE INSTITUTIONS WERE AND ARE WITHOUT EXCEPTION JEWS I SAY 'WITHOUT EXCEPTION FOR THE FEW NON JEWS WHO HAD A SHARE IN THEM ARE IN THE LAST RESORT NOTHING BUT SCREENS SHOP WINDOW CHRISTIANS WHOM ONE NEEDS IN ORDER FOR THE SAKE OF THE MASSES TO KEEP UP THE APPEARANCE THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS WERE AFTER ALL FOUNDED AS A NATURAL OUTCOME OF THE NEEDS AND THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF ALL PEOPLES ALIKE AND WERE NOT AS WAS THE FACT INSTITUTIONS WHICH CORRESPOND ONLY WITH THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND ARE THE OUTCOME OF THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THEN EUROPE STOOD AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS EUROPE BEGAN TO DIVIDE INTO TWO HALVES INTO WEST EUROPE AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AT FIRST WESTERN EUROPE TOOK THE LEAD IN THE PROCESS OF INDUSTRIALIZATION ESPECIALLY IN ENGLAND CROWDS OF FARM LABORERS SONS OF FARMERS OR EVEN RUINED FARMERS THEMSELVES STREAMED INTO THE TOWNS AND THERE FORMED A NEW FOURTH ESTATE BUT HERE ONE FACT IS OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO ADMIT THIS ENGLAND LIKE FRANCE HAD RELATIVELY FEW JEWS AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WAS THAT THE GREAT MASSES CONCENTRATED IN THE TOWNS DID NOT COME INTO IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH THIS ALIEN NATION AND THUS FEELINGS OF AVERSION WHICH MUST OTHERWISE NECESSARILY HAVE ARISEN DID NOT FIND SUFFICIENT NOURISHMENT FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT IN THE END THE FIFTY OR SIXTY THOUSAND JEWS IN ENGLAND THERE WAS HARDLY THAT NUMBER IN ENGLAND THEN WITH SUPREME EASE WERE ABLE SO TO 'EUROPEANIZE' THEMSELVES THAT THEY REMAINED HIDDEN FROM THE PRIMITIVE EYE OF THE ORDINARY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC AND AS 'CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY AND ESPECIALLY AS REPRESENTATIVES OF CAPITAL ON A LARGE SCALE THEY COULD APPEAR NO LONGER AS FOREIGNERS BUT THEMSELVES BECAME ENGLISHMEN THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT ANTI SEMITISM IN THESE STATES COULD NEVER ATTAIN TO ANY NATIVE VIGOR FOR THE SAME IS TRUE OF FRANCE AND PRECISELY FOR THIS REASON IN THESE COUNTRIES IT WAS POSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE THE SYSTEM WHICH WE HAVE TO REPRESENT TO OURSELVES UNDER THE CONCEPT OF 'DEMOCRACY THERE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CREATE A STATE FORM WHOSE MEANING COULD ONLY BE THE MASTERY OF THE HERD OVER THE INTELLIGENTSIA THE MASTERY OVER TRUE ENERGY THROUGH THE DEAD WEIGHT OF MASSED NUMBERS IN OTHER WORDS IT MUST BE SUPREMELY EASY FOR THE JEWISH INTELLIGENTSIA SMALL IN NUMBERS AND THEREFORE COMPLETELY HIDDEN IN THE BODY OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE SO TO WORK UPON THE MASSES THAT THE LATTER QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF WHOM THEY WERE OBEYING IN THE END DID BUT SERVE THE PURPOSES OF THIS SMALL STRATUM OF SOCIETY THROUGH THE PRESS PROPAGANDA THROUGH THE USE OF THE ORGANS OF INFORMATION IT WAS POSSIBLE IN ENGLAND TO FOUND THE GREAT MODEL PARTIES ALREADY IN THOSE EARLY DAYS THEY SAW TO IT SHREWDLY THAT HERE WERE ALWAYS TWO OR THREE GROUPS APPARENTLY HOSTILE TO EACH OTHER BUT IN FACT ALL HANGING ON A GOLD THREAD THE WHOLE DESIGNED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF A HUMAN CHARACTERISTIC THAT THE LONGER A MAN POSSESSES AN OBJECT THE MORE READILY HE GROWS TIRED OF IT HE CRAVES SOMETHING NEW THEREFORE ONE NEEDS TWO PARTIES THE ONE IS IN OFFICE THE OTHER IN OPPOSITION WHEN THE ONE HAS PLAYED ITSELF OUT THEN THE OPPOSITION PARTY COMES INTO POWER AND THE PARTY WHICH HAS HAD ITS DAY IS NOW IN ITS TURN THE OPPOSITION AFTER TWENTY YEARS THE NEW PARTY ITSELF HAS ONCE MORE PLAYED ITSELF OUT AND THE GAME BEGINS AFRESH IN TRUTH THIS IS A HIGHLY INGENIOUS MILL IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF A NATION ARE GROUND
VERY SMALL AS EVERYONE KNOWS THIS SYSTEM IS GIVEN SOME SUCH NAME AS 'SELF GOVERNMENT OF A PEOPLE 'BESIDES THIS WE ALWAYS FIND TWO GREAT CATCHWORDS 'FREEDOM' AND 'DEMOCRACY USED I MIGHT SAY AS SIGNBOARDS 'FREEDOM' UNDER THAT TERM IS UNDERSTOOD AT LEAST AMONGST THOSE IN AUTHORITY WHO IN FACT CARRY ON THE GOVERNMENT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN UNCHECKED PLUNDERING OF THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE TO WHICH NO RESISTANCE CAN BE OFFERED THE MASSES THEMSELVES NATURALLY BELIEVE THAT UNDER THE TERM 'FREEDOM' THEY POSSESS THE RIGHT TO A QUITE PECULIAR FREEDOM OF MOTION FREEDOM TO MOVE THE TONGUE AND TO SAY WHAT THEY CHOOSE FREEDOM TO MOVE ABOUT THE STREETS ETC A BITTER DECEPTION AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF DEMOCRACY IN GENERAL EVEN IN THE EARLY DAYS BOTH ENGLAND AND FRANCE HAD ALREADY BEEN BOUND WITH THE FETTERS OF SLAVERY WITH I MIGHT SAY A BRAZEN SECURITY THESE STATES ARE FETTERED WITH JEWISH CHAINS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS WIDESPREAD AVERSION IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE JEW TO SPREAD INFECTION IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE AND ESPECIALLY SO SINCE TRADITIONALLY LOYALTY WAS CENTERED IN A PERSON THE FORM OF THE STATE WAS A MONARCHY AND POWER DID NOT LIE WITH AN IRRESPONSIBLE MAJORITY THUS THE JEW SAW THAT HERE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR AN ENLIGHTENED DESPOTISM TO ARISE BASED UPON THE ARMY THE BUREAUCRACY AND THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE STILL UNAFFECTED BY THE JEWISH POISON THE INTELLIGENTSIA AT THAT TIME WAS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY GERMAN BIG BUSINESS AND THE NEW INDUSTRIES WERE IN GERMAN HANDS WHILE THE LAST RESERVOIR OF A PEOPLE'S STRENGTH THE PEASANTRY WAS THROUGHOUT HEALTHY IN SUCH CONDITIONS IF AS INDUSTRY GREW A FOURTH ESTATE WAS FORMED IN THE TOWNS THERE WAS THE DANGER THAT THIS FOURTH ESTATE MIGHT ALLY ITSELF WITH THE MONARCHY AND THUS WITH ITS SUPPORT THERE MIGHT ARISE A POPULAR MONARCHY OR A POPULAR 'KAISERTUM' WHICH WOULD BE READY AND WILLING TO GIVE A MORTAL BLOW TO THOSE POWERS OF INTERNATIONAL SUPRA STATE FINANCE WHICH WERE AT THAT TIME BEGINNING TO GROW IN INFLUENCE THIS WAS NOT IMPOSSIBLE IN THE HISTORY OF GERMANY PRINCES HAD FROM TIME TO TIME FOUND THEMSELVES FORCED AS IN BRANDENBURG TO TURN AGAINST THE NOBILITY AND SEEK POPULAR SUPPORT BUT THIS POSSIBILITY CONSTITUTED A GRAVE DANGER FOR JEWRY IF THE GREAT MASSES OF THE NEW INDUSTRIALIZED WORKMEN HAD COME INTO NATIONALIST HANDS AND LIKE A TRUE SOCIAL LEAVEN HAD PENETRATED THE WHOLE NATION IF THE LIBERATION OF THE DIFFERENT ESTATES HAD FOLLOWED STEP BY STEP IN AN ORGANIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE STATE HAD LATER LOOKED TO THEM FOR SUPPORT THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN CREATED WHAT MANY HOPED FOR IN NOVEMBER 1918 VIZ A NATIONAL SOCIAL STATE FOR SOCIALISM IN ITSELF IS ANYTHING BUT AN INTERNATIONAL CREATION AS A NOBLE CONCEPTION IT HAS INDEED GROWN UP EXCLUSIVELY IN ARYAN HEARTS IT OWES ITS INTELLECTUAL GLORIES ONLY TO ARYAN BRAINS IT IS ENTIRELY ALIEN TO THE JEW THE JEW WILL ALWAYS BE THE BORN CHAMPION OF PRIVATE CAPITAL IN ITS WORST FORM THAT OF UNCHECKED EXPLOITATION VOLTAIRE AS WELL AS ROUSSEAU TOGETHER WITH OUR GERMAN FICHTE AND MANY ANOTHER THEY ARE ALL WITHOUT EXCEPTION UNITED IN THEIR RECOGNITION THAT THE JEW IS NOT ONLY A FOREIGN ELEMENT DIFFERING IN HIS ESSENTIAL CHARACTER WHICH IS UTTERLY HARMFUL TO THE NATURE OF THE ARYAN BUT THAT THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN ITSELF STANDS AGAINST US AS OUR DEADLY FOE AND SO WILL STAND AGAINST US ALWAYS AND FOR ALL TIME THE MASTER STROKE OF THE JEW WAS TO CLAIM THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FOURTH ESTATE HE FOUNDED THE MOVEMENT BOTH OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND THE COMMUNISTS HIS POLICY WAS TWOFOLD HE HAD HIS 'APOSTLES' IN BOTH POLITICAL CAMPS AMONGST THE PARTIES OF THE RIGHT HE ENCOURAGED THOSE FEATURES WHICH WERE MOST REPUGNANT TO THE PEOPLE THE PASSION FOR MONEY UNSCRUPULOUS METHODS IN TRADE WHICH WERE EMPLOYED SO RUTHLESSLY AS TO GIVE RISE TO THE PROVERB 'BUSINESS TOO MARCHES OVER CORPSES AND THE JEW ATTACKED THE PARTIES OF THE RIGHT JEWS WORMED THEIR WAY INTO THE FAMILIES OF THE UPPER CLASSES IT WAS FROM THE JEWS THAT THE LATTER TOOK THEIR WIVES THE RESULT WAS THAT IN A SHORT TIME IT WAS PRECISELY THE RULING CLASS WHICH BECAME IN ITS CHARACTER COMPLETELY ESTRANGED FROM ITS OWN PEOPLE AND THIS FACT GAVE THE JEW HIS OPPORTUNITY WITH THE PARTIES OF THE LEFT HERE HE PLAYED THE PART OF THE COMMON DEMAGOGUE TWO MEANS ENABLED HIM TO DRIVE AWAY IN DISGUST THE WHOLE INTELLIGENTSIA OF THE NATION FROM THE LEADERSHIP OF THE WORKERS FIRST HIS INTERNATIONAL ATTITUDE FOR THE NATIVE INTELLIGENCE OF THE COUNTRY IS PREPARED TO MAKE SACRIFICES IT WILL DO ANYTHING FOR THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE BUT IT CANNOT BELIEVE IN THE MAD VIEW THAT THROUGH THE DENIAL OF THAT NATIONAL LIFE THROUGH A REFUSAL TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF ONE'S OWN PEOPLE THROUGH THE BREAKING DOWN OF THE NATIONAL RESISTANCE TO THE FOREIGNER IT IS POSSIBLE TO RAISE UP A PEOPLE AND MAKE IT HAPPY THAT IT CANNOT DO AND SO IT REMAINED AT A DISTANCE AND THE JEW'S SECOND INSTRUMENT WAS THE MARXIST THEORY IN AND FOR ITSELF FOR DIRECTLY ONE WENT ON TO ASSERT THAT PROPERTY AS SUCH IS THEFT DIRECTLY ONE DESERTED THE OBVIOUS FORMULA THAT ONLY THE NATURAL WEALTH OF A COUNTRY CAN AND SHOULD BE COMMON PROPERTY BUT THAT THAT WHICH A MAN CREATES OR GAINS THROUGH HIS HONEST LABOR IS HIS OWN IMMEDIATELY THE ECONOMIC INTELLIGENTSIA WITH ITS NATIONALIST OUTLOOK COULD HERE TOO NO LONGER CO OPERATE FOR THIS INTELLIGENTSIA WAS BOUND TO SAY TO ITSELF THAT THIS THEORY MEANT THE COLLAPSE OF ANY HUMAN CIVILIZATION WHATEVER THUS THE JEW SUCCEEDED IN ISOLATING THIS NEW MOVEMENT OF THE WORKERS FROM ALL THE NATIONALIST ELEMENTS MORE AND MORE SO TO INFLUENCE THE MASSES THAT HE PERSUADED THOSE OF THE RIGHT THAT THE FAULTS OF THE LEFT WERE THE FAULTS OF THE GERMAN WORKMAN AND SIMILARLY HE MADE IT APPEAR TO THOSE OF THE LEFT THAT THE FAULTS OF THE RIGHT WERE SIMPLY THE FAULTS OF THE SO CALLED 'BOURGEOIS AND NEITHER SIDE NOTICED THAT ON BOTH SIDES THE FAULTS WERE THE RESULT OF A SCHEME PLANNED BY ALIEN DEVILISH AGITATORS AND ONLY SO IS IT POSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS DIRTY JOKE OF WORLD HISTORY COULD COME TO BE THAT STOCK EXCHANGE JEWS SHOULD BECOME THE LEADERS OF A WORKERS MOVEMENT IT IS A GIGANTIC FRAUD WORLD HISTORY HAS SELDOM SEEN ITS LIKE AND THEN WE MUST ASK OURSELVES WHAT ARE THE FINAL AIMS OF THIS DEVELOPMENT SO SOON AS MILLIONS OF MEN HAVE HAD IT HAMMERED INTO THEM THAT THEY ARE SO OPPRESSED AND ENSLAVED THAT IT MATTERS NOT
WHAT THEIR PERSONAL ATTITUDE MAY BE TO THEIR PEOPLE THEIR STATE OR ECONOMIC LIFE THEN A KIND OF PASSIVE RESISTANCE MUST RESULT WHICH SOONER OR LATER WILL DO FATAL DAMAGE TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY THROUGH THE PREACHING OF THE MARXIST ECONOMIC THEORY THE NATIONAL ECONOMY MUST GO TO RUIN WE SEE THE RESULTS IN RUSSIA THE END OF THE WHOLE ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE STATE THE HANDING OVER OF THE COMMUNITY TO THE INTERNATIONAL WORLD OF FINANCE AND THE PROCESS IS FURTHERED THROUGH THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 'POLITICAL STRIKE OFTEN THERE ARE NO ADEQUATE ECONOMIC GROUNDS FOR A STRIKE BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS POLITICAL GROUNDS AND PLENTY OF THEM AND TO THIS MUST BE ADDED THE PRACTICAL POLITICAL SABOTAGE OF THE STATE SINCE THE THOUGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS CONCENTRATED ON THE IDEA OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY IT IS CLEAR THAT A NATION'S ECONOMIC LIFE DEPENDS UPON THE STRENGTH OF A NATIONAL STATE IT DOES NOT LIVE ON SUCH PHRASES AS 'APPEASEMENT OF THE PEOPLES' OR 'FREEDOM OF THE PEOPLES 'AT THE MOMENT WHEN NO PEOPLE SUPPORTS THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF A NATION READY TO GIVE IT ITS PROTECTION AT THAT MOMENT ECONOMIC LIFE COLLAPSES THE BREAKING IN PIECES OF A NATION'S STRENGTH IS THE END OF A NATION'S PROSPERITY THE NATIONAL EXISTENCE MUST CEASE ALTOGETHER AND ONE CAN SEE CONSTANTLY HOW WONDERFULLY THE STOCK EXCHANGE JEW AND THE LEADER OF THE WORKERS HOW THE STOCK EXCHANGE ORGAN AND THE JOURNAL OF THE WORKERS CO OPERATE THEY BOTH PURSUE ONE COMMON POLICY AND A SINGLE AIM MOSES KOHN ON THE ONE SIDE ENCOURAGES HIS ASSOCIATION TO REFUSE THE WORKERS' DEMANDS WHILE HIS BROTHER ISAAC IN THE FACTORY INCITES THE MASSES AND SHOUTS 'LOOK AT THEM THEY ONLY WANT TO OPPRESS YOU SHAKE OFF YOUR FETTERS 'HIS BROTHER TAKES CARE THAT THE FETTERS ARE WELL AND TRULY FORGED THE STOCK EXCHANGE ORGAN SEEKS WITHOUT INTERMISSION TO ENCOURAGE FEVERED SPECULATION AND UNPARALLELED CORNERS IN GRAIN AND IN THE FOOD OF THE PEOPLE WHILE THE WORKMEN'S NEWSPAPER LETS OFF ALL ITS GUNS ON THE MASSES TELLING THEM THAT BREAD IS DEARER AND THIS THAT AND THE OTHER IS DEARER UP PROLETARIANS ENDURE IT NO LONGER DOWN WITH HOW LONG CAN THIS PROCESS LAST IT MEANS THE UTTER DESTRUCTION NOT ONLY OF ECONOMIC LIFE BUT OF THE PEOPLE IT IS CLEAR THAT ALL THESE APOSTLES WHO TALK THEIR TONGUES OUT OF THEIR HEADS BUT WHO SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE HOTEL EXCELSIOR TRAVEL IN EXPRESS TRAINS AND SPEND THEIR LEAVE FOR THEIR HEALTH IN NICE THESE PEOPLE DO NOT EXERT THEIR ENERGIES FOR LOVE OF THE PEOPLE NO THE PEOPLE IS NOT TO PROFIT IT SHALL MERELY BE BROUGHT INTO DEPENDENCE ON THESE MEN THE BACKBONE OF ITS INDEPENDENCE ITS OWN ECONOMIC LIFE IS TO BE DESTROYED THAT IT MAY THE MORE SURELY RELAPSE INTO THE GOLDEN FETTERS OF THE PERPETUAL INTEREST SLAVERY OF THE JEWISH RACE AND THIS PROCESS WILL END WHEN SUDDENLY OUT OF THE MASSES SOMEONE ARISES WHO SEIZES THE LEADERSHIP FINDS OTHER COMRADES AND FANS INTO FLAME THE PASSIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN HELD IN CHECK AND LOOSES THEM AGAINST THE DECEIVERS THAT IS THE LURKING DANGER AND THE JEW CAN MEET IT IN ONE WAY ONLY BY DESTROYING THE HOSTILE NATIONAL INTELLIGENTSIA THAT IS THE INEVITABLE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE JEW IN HIS REVOLUTION AND THIS AIM HE MUST PURSUE HE KNOWS WELL ENOUGH HIS ECONOMICS BRINGS NO BLESSING HIS IS NO MASTER PEOPLE HE IS AN EXPLOITER THE JEWS ARE A PEOPLE OF ROBBERS HE HAS NEVER FOUNDED ANY CIVILIZATION THOUGH HE HAS DESTROYED CIVILIZATIONS BY THE HUNDRED HE POSSESSES NOTHING OF HIS OWN CREATION TO WHICH HE CAN POINT EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS IS STOLEN FOREIGN PEOPLES FOREIGN WORKMEN BUILD HIM HIS TEMPLES IT IS FOREIGNERS WHO CREATE AND WORK FOR HIM IT IS FOREIGNERS WHO SHED THEIR BLOOD FOR HIM HE KNOWS NO 'PEOPLE'S ARMY' HE HAS ONLY HIRED MERCENARIES WHO ARE READY TO GO TO DEATH ON HIS BEHALF HE HAS NO ART OF HIS OWN BIT BY BIT HE HAS STOLEN IT ALL FROM THE OTHER PEOPLES OR HAS WATCHED THEM AT WORK AND THEN MADE HIS COPY HE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW HOW MERELY TO PRESERVE THE PRECIOUS THINGS WHICH OTHERS HAVE CREATED AS HE TURNS THE TREASURES OVER IN HIS HAND THEY ARE TRANSFORMED INTO DIRT AND DUNG HE KNOWS THAT HE CANNOT MAINTAIN ANY STATE FOR LONG THAT IS ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HIM AND THE ARYAN TRUE THE ARYAN ALSO HAS DOMINATED OTHER PEOPLES BUT HOW HE ENTERED ON THE LAND HE CLEARED THE FORESTS OUT OF WILDERNESSES HE HAS CREATED CIVILIZATIONS AND HE HAS NOT USED THE OTHERS FOR HIS OWN INTERESTS HE HAS SO FAR AS THEIR CAPACITIES PERMITTED INCORPORATED THEM INTO HIS STATE AND THROUGH HIM ART AND SCIENCE WERE BROUGHT TO FLOWER IN THE LAST RESORT IT WAS THE ARYAN AND THE ARYAN ALONE WHO COULD FORM STATES AND COULD SET THEM ON THEIR PATH TO FUTURE GREATNESS ALL THAT THE JEW CANNOT DO AND BECAUSE HE CANNOT DO IT THEREFORE ALL HIS REVOLUTIONS MUST BE 'INTERNATIONAL THEY MUST SPREAD AS A PESTILENCE SPREADS HE CAN BUILD NO STATE AND SAY 'SEE HERE HERE STANDS THE STATE A MODEL FOR ALL NOW COPY US HE MUST TAKE CARE THAT THE PLAGUE DOES NOT DIE THAT IT IS NOT LIMITED TO ONE PLACE OR ELSE IN A SHORT TIME THIS PLAGUE HEARTH WOULD BURN ITSELF OUT SO HE IS FORCED TO BRING EVERY MORTAL THING TO AN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION FOR HOW LONG UNTIL THE WHOLE WORLD SINKS IN RUINS AND BRINGS HIM DOWN WITH IT IN THE MIDST OF THE RUINS THAT PROCESS TODAY IN RUSSIA IS PRACTICALLY COMPLETE THE WHOLE OF PRESENT DAY RUSSIA HAS NOTHING TO SHOW BEYOND A RUINED CIVILIZATION A COLONY RIPE FOR DEVELOPMENT THROUGH ALIEN CAPITAL AND EVEN THIS CAPITAL IN ORDER TO SUPPLY RESOURCES IN LABOR FOR ITS PRACTICAL WORK MUST INTRODUCE ARYAN INTELLECTS SINCE FOR THIS AGAIN THE JEW IS USELESS
HERE TOO HE IS ALL RAPACITY NEVER SATISFIED HE KNOWS NO ORDERED ECONOMY HE KNOWS NO ORDERED BODY OF ADMINISTRATORS OVER THERE IN RUSSIA HE IS LAYING HIS HANDS ON EVERYTHING THEY TAKE THE NOBLE'S DIAMONDS TO HELP 'THE PEOPLE THE DIAMONDS THEN STRAY INTO FOREIGN SOCIETIES AND ARE NO MORE SEEN HE SEIZES TO HIMSELF THE TREASURES OF THE CHURCHES BUT NOT TO FEED THE PEOPLE OH NO EVERYTHING WANDERS AWAY AND LEAVES NOT A TRACE BEHIND IN HIS GREED HE HAS BECOME QUITE SENSELESS HE CAN KEEP HOLD OF NOTHING HE HAS ONLY WITHIN HIM THE INSTINCT FOR DESTRUCTION AND SO HE HIMSELF COLLAPSES WITH THE TREASURE THAT HE HAS DESTROYED IT IS A TRAGIC FATE WE HAVE OFTEN GROWN EXCITED OVER THE DEATH OF A CRIMINAL IF AN ANARCHIST IS SHOT IN SPAIN WE RAISE A MIGHTY HOWL OVER 'THE SACRIFICE OF VALUABLE HUMAN BLOOD' AND HERE IN THE EAST THIRTY MILLION HUMAN BEINGS ARE BEING SLOWLY MARTYRED DONE TO DEATH SOME ON THE SCAFFOLD SOME BY MACHINE GUNS MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS THROUGH STARVATION A WHOLE PEOPLE IS DYING AND NOW WE CAN PERHAPS UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT FORMERLY ALL THE CIVILIZATIONS OF MESOPOTAMIA DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE SO THAT ONE CAN ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY FIND IN THE DESERT SAND THE REMAINS OF THESE CITIES WE SEE HOW IN OUR OWN DAY WHOLE COUNTRIES DIE OUT UNDER THIS SCOURGE OF GOD AND WE SEE HOW THIS SCOURGE IS THREATENING GERMANY TOO AND HOW WITH US OUR OWN PEOPLE IN MAD INFATUATION IS CONTRIBUTING TO BRING UPON ITSELF THE SAME YOKE THE SAME MISERY WE KNOW THAT THE REVOLUTION WHICH BEGAN IN 1918 HAS COVERED PERHAPS BUT THE FIRST THIRD OF ITS COURSE TWO THINGS HOWEVER THERE ARE WHICH MUST SCOURGE IT FORWARD UPON ITS WAY ECONOMIC CAUSES AND POLITICAL CAUSES ON THE ECONOMIC SIDE THE EVER GROWING DISTRESS AND IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE ARE NOT NEARLY ALL GERMANS IN THEIR HEARTS LET EACH ONE ADMIT IT IN DESPAIR WHEN THEY CONSIDER THE SITUATION WHICH LEAVES US QUITE DEFENSELESS IN FACE OF A EUROPE WHICH IS SO HOSTILE TO GERMANY AND WHY IS EUROPE HOSTILE WE SEE HOW OVER THERE IN THIS OTHER EUROPE IT IS NOT THE PEOPLES WHICH AGITATE AGAINST US IT IS THE SECRET POWER OF THE ORGANIZED PRESS WHICH CEASELESSLY POURS NEW POISON INTO THE HEARTS OF THESE PEOPLES AND WHO ARE THEN THESE BANDITS OF THE PRESS THE BROTHERS AND THE RELATIVES OF THE PUBLISHERS OF OUR OWN NEWSPAPERS AND THE CAPITAL SOURCE WHICH PROVIDES THE ENERGY WHICH HERE AND THERE DRIVES THEM FORWARD IS THE JEWISH DREAM OF WORLD SUPREMACY TODAY THE IDEA OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY HAS LOST ITS FORCE ONE CAN STILL BRING MEN OUT OF THE FACTORIES BUT ONLY BY MEANS OF TERRORISM IF YOU ASK FOR AN HONEST ANSWER THE WORKER WILL CONFESS THAT HE NO LONGER BELIEVES IN THIS INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY AND THE BELIEF IN THE SO CALLED REASONABLENESS OF THE OTHER PEOPLES HAS GONE TOO HOW OFTEN HAVE WE BEEN TOLD THAT REASON WILL LEAD THEM NOT TO BE TOO HARD WITH US TRUE REASON SHOULD HAVE MOVED THEM THUS BUT WHAT DID MOVE THEM HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH REASON FOR HERE THERE IS NO QUESTION OF THE THOUGHT OF REASONABLE PEOPLES IT IS THE THOUGHT OF A WILD BEAST TEARING RAGING IN ITS UNREASON THAT DRIVES ALL OF THEM TO THE SAME RUIN AS THAT TO WHICH WE OURSELVES ARE DRIVEN SO THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE IN GERMANY ARE BECOMING IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE COMPLETELY LOST YET HERE AND THERE PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO GET SOME PRACTICE IN CRITICISM SLOWLY CAUTIOUSLY AND YET WITH A CERTAIN ACCURACY THE FINGER IS BEING PLACED ON THE REAL WOUND OF OUR PEOPLE AND THUS ONE COMES TO REALIZE IF ONLY THIS DEVELOPMENT GOES ON FOR A TIME IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT FROM GERMANY THE LIGHT SHOULD COME WHICH IS DESTINED TO LIGHT BOTH GERMANY AND THE WORLD TO THEIR SALVATION AND AT THAT POINT THE EVERLASTING LIE BEGINS TO WORK AGAINST US WITH EVERY MEANS IN ITS POWER IT IS SAID IF ONE CRITICIZES THE STATE OF AFFAIRS TO WHICH WE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TODAY THAT ONE IS A REACTIONARY A MONARCHIST A PAN GERMAN I ASK YOU WHAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN THE STATE OF GERMANY TODAY IF DURING THESE THREE YEARS THERE HAD BEEN NO CRITICISM AT ALL I BELIEVE THAT IN FACT THERE HAS BEEN FAR FAR TOO LITTLE CRITICISM OUR PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY IS MUCH TOO UNCRITICAL OR OTHERWISE IT WOULD LONG AGO HAVE NOT ONLY SEEN THROUGH MANY THINGS BUT WOULD HAVE SWEPT THEM AWAY WITH ITS FIST THE CRISIS IS DEVELOPING TOWARDS ITS CULMINATION THE DAY IS NOT FAR DISTANT WHEN FOR THE REASONS WHICH I HAVE STATED THE GERMAN REVOLUTION MUST BE CARRIED FORWARD ANOTHER STEP THE LEADERS KNOW ALL TOO WELL THAT THINGS CANNOT ALWAYS GO ON AS THEY ARE GOING TODAY ONE MAY RAISE PRICES TEN TIMES BY 100 PER CENT BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL IF IN THE END EVEN A GERMAN WILL ACCEPT A MILLIARD OF MARKS FOR HIS DAY'S WAGE IF IN THE LAST RESORT WITH HIS MILLIARD WAGE HE MUST STILL STARVE IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER ONE WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP UP THIS GREAT FRAUD UPON THE NATION THERE WILL COME A DAY WHEN THIS MUST STOP AND THEREFORE ONE MUST BUILD FOR THAT DAY BEFORE IT COMES AND SO NOW GERMANY IS REACHING THAT STAGE WHICH RUSSIA HAS DRUNK TO THE LEES NOW IN ONE LAST STUPENDOUS ASSAULT THEY WILL FINALLY CRUSH ALL CRITICISM ALL OPPOSITION NO RATHER WHATEVER HONESTY IS STILL LEFT TO US AND THAT THEY WILL DO THE MORE RAPIDLY THE MORE CLEARLY THEY SEE THAT THE MASSES ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING NATIONAL SOCIALIST TEACHING WHETHER FOR THE MOMENT IT COMES TO THEM UNDER THAT NAME OR UNDER ANOTHER THE FACT IS THAT EVERYWHERE MORE AND MORE IT IS MAKING HEADWAY TODAY ALL THESE FOLK CANNOT YET BELONG TO A SINGLE PARTY BUT WHEREVER YOU GO IN GERMANY YES ALMOST IN THE WHOLE WORLD YOU FIND ALREADY MILLIONS OF THINKING MEN WHO KNOW THAT A STATE CAN BE BUILT ONLY ON A SOCIAL FOUNDATION AND THEY KNOW ALSO THAT THE DEADLY FOE OF EVERY SOCIAL CONCEPTION IS THE INTERNATIONAL JEW EVERY TRULY NATIONAL IDEA IS IN THE LAST RESORT SOCIAL I E HE WHO IS PREPARED SO COMPLETELY TO ADOPT THE CAUSE OF
HIS PEOPLE THAT HE REALLY KNOWS NO HIGHER IDEAL THAN THE PROSPERITY OF THIS HIS OWN PEOPLE HE WHO HAS SO TAKEN TO HEART THE MEANING OF OUR GREAT SONG 'DEUTSCHLAND DEUTSCHLAND UBER ALLES THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD STANDS FOR HIM HIGHER THAN THIS GERMANY PEOPLE AND LAND LAND AND PEOPLE HE IS A SOCIALIST AND HE WHO IN THIS PEOPLE SYMPATHIZES WITH THE POOREST OF ITS CITIZENS WHO IN THIS PEOPLE SEES IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL A VALUABLE MEMBER OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AND WHO RECOGNIZES THAT THIS COMMUNITY CAN FLOURISH ONLY WHEN IT IS FORMED NOT OF RULERS AND OPPRESSED BUT WHEN ALL ACCORDING TO THEIR CAPACITIES FULFILL THEIR DUTY TO THEIR FATHERLAND AND THE COMMUNITY OF THE PEOPLE AND ARE VALUED ACCORDINGLY HE WHO SEEKS TO PRESERVE THE NATIVE VIGOR THE STRENGTH AND THE YOUTHFUL ENERGY OF THE MILLIONS OF WORKING MEN AND WHO ABOVE ALL IS CONCERNED THAT OUR PRECIOUS POSSESSION OUR YOUTH SHOULD NOT BEFORE ITS TIME BE USED UP IN UNHEALTHY HARMFUL WORK HE IS NOT MERELY A SOCIALIST BUT HE IS ALSO NATIONAL IN THE HIGHEST SENSE OF THAT WORD IT IS THE TEACHING OF THESE FACTS WHICH APPEARS TO THE JEWS AS LEADERS OF THE REVOLUTION TODAY TO CONSTITUTE A THREATENING DANGER AND IT IS PRECISELY THIS WHICH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE MAKES THE JEW WISH TO GET IN HIS BLOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR ONE THING HE KNOWS QUITE WELL IN THE LAST RESORT THERE IS ONLY ONE DANGER WHICH HE HAS TO FEAR AND THAT DANGER IS THIS YOUNG MOVEMENT HE KNOWS THE OLD PARTIES THEY ARE EASILY SATISFIED ONLY ENDOW THEM WITH A FEW SEATS AS MINISTERS OR WITH SIMILAR POSTS AND THEY ARE READY TO GO ALONG WITH YOU AND IN ESPECIAL HE KNOWS ONE THING THEY ARE SO INNOCENTLY STUPID IN THEIR CASE THE TRUTH OF THE OLD SAYING IS PROVED AFRESH EVERY DAY 'THOSE WHOM THE GODS WISH TO DESTROY THEY FIRST STRIKE WITH BLINDNESS THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK WITH BLINDNESS THEREFORE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE GODS WISH TO DESTROY THEM ONLY LOOK AT THESE PARTIES AND THEIR LEADERS STRESEMANN AND THE REST OF THEM THEY ARE INDEED NOT DANGEROUS THEY NEVER GO TO THE ROOTS OF THE EVIL THEY ALL STILL THINK THAT WITH FORBEARANCE WITH HUMANITY WITH ACCOMMODATION THEY CAN FIGHT A BATTLE WHICH HAS NOT ITS EQUAL IN THIS WORLD THROUGH GENTLENESS THEY THINK THAT THEY MUST DEMONSTRATE TO THE ENEMY OF THE LEFT THAT THEY ARE READY FOR APPEASEMENT SO AS TO STAY THE DEADLY CANCEROUS ULCER THROUGH A POLICY OF MODERATION NO A THOUSAND TIMES NO HERE THERE ARE ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES EITHER VICTORY OR DEFEAT WHAT TODAY IS THE MEANING OF THESE GREAT PREPARATIONS FOR THE DECISIVE BATTLE ON THE PART OF BOLSHEVIST JUDAISM TO MAKE THE NATION DEFENSELESS IN ARMS AND TO MAKE THE PEOPLE DEFENSELESS IN SPIRIT TWO GREAT AIMS ABROAD GERMANY IS ALREADY HUMILIATED THE STATE TREMBLES BEFORE EVERY FRENCH NEGRO CAPTAIN THE NATION IS NO LONGER DANGEROUS AND WITHIN GERMANY THEY HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT ARMS SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE DECENT ELEMENTS OF THE PEOPLE AND THAT IN THEIR STEAD RUSSIAN JEWISH BOLSHEVIST BANDS SHOULD BE ARMED ONLY ONE THING REMAINS STILL TO DO VIZ THE MUZZLING OF THE SPIRIT ABOVE ALL THE ARREST OF THE EVIL 'AGITATORS' THAT IS THE NAME THEY GIVE TO THOSE WHO DARE TO TELL THE PEOPLE THE TRUTH NOT ONLY ARE THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO BE KNOWN TO ALL BUT THE MASSES ARE TO BE INCITED AGAINST THEIR PERSONS JUST AS THE JEW COULD ONCE INCITE THE MOB OF JERUSALEM AGAINST CHRIST SO TODAY HE MUST SUCCEED IN INCITING FOLK WHO HAVE BEEN DUPED INTO MADNESS TO ATTACK THOSE WHO GOD'S TRUTH SEEK TO DEAL WITH THIS PEOPLE IN UTTER HONESTY AND SINCERITY AND SO HE BEGINS TO INTIMIDATE THEM AND HE KNOWS THAT THIS PRESSURE IN ITSELF IS ENOUGH TO SHUT THE MOUTHS OF HUNDREDS YES OF THOUSANDS FOR THEY THINK IF I ONLY HOLD MY TONGUE THEN I SHALL BE SAFE IN CASE THEY COME INTO POWER NO MY FRIEND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WILL BE THAT I MAY HANG PERHAPS STILL TALKING WHILE YOU WILL HANG IN SILENCE HERE TOO RUSSIA CAN GIVE US COUNTLESS EXAMPLES AND WITH US IT WILL BE THE SAME STORY WE KNOW THAT THE SO CALLED 'LAW FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE REPUBLIC' WHICH COMES FROM BERLIN TODAY IS NOTHING ELSE THAN A MEANS FOR REDUCING ALL CRITICISM TO SILENCE WE KNOW TOO THAT NO EFFORT WILL BE SPARED SO THAT THE LAST OUTSTANDING PERSONALITIES THOSE WHO WITHIN GERMANY FORESEE THE COMING OF DISASTER SHALL IN GOOD TIME DISAPPEAR AND TO THAT END THE POPULATION OF NORTH GERMANY WILL BE SCOURGED INTO OPPOSITION TO BAVARIA WITH EVERY LIE AND EVERY MISREPRESENTATION THAT COMES TO HAND UP THERE THEY HAVE THE FEELING THAT IN ONE CORNER OF THE REICH THE SPIRIT OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE IS NOT YET BROKEN AND THAT IS THE POINT TO WHICH WE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS HAVE TO GRAPPLE OURSELVES WE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS ARE GOD'S TRUTH PERHAPS THE MOST LOYAL THE MOST DEVOTED OF ALL MEN TO OUR GERMAN FATHERLAND FOR THREE YEARS WE HAVE WAGED A WAR OFTEN AGAINST DEATH AND DEVIL BUT ALWAYS ONLY FOR OUR GERMAN FATHERLAND WE GOT SO FAR THAT AT THE LAST AS CROWN OF ALL OUR LABORS WE HAD TO LAND IN PRISON BUT IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING THERE IS ONE THING WE WOULD SAY WE DO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT AND THE GERMAN FATHERLAND WHEN TODAY HERE IN THE LANDTAG OR IN THE REICHSTAG AT BERLIN SOME LOUSY HALF ASIATIC YOUTH CASTS IN OUR TEETH THE CHARGE THAT WE HAVE NO LOYALTY TO THE REICH I BEG YOU DO NOT DISTRESS YOURSELVES THE BAVARIAN PEOPLE HAS SEALED ITS LOYALTY TO THE REICH WITH ITS COUNTLESS REGIMENTS WHICH FOUGHT FOR THE REICH AND OFTEN SANK UNDER THE EARTH TWO OR THREE TIMES WE ARE CONVINCED AND THAT IN THE LAST RESORT IS OUR ONE GREAT FAITH THAT OUT OF THIS BITTEREST DISTRESS AND THIS UTTER MISERY THE GERMAN REICH WILL RISE
AGAIN BUT NOT AS NOW NOT AS THE OFFSPRING OF WRETCHEDNESS AND MISERY WE SHALL POSSESS ONCE AGAIN A TRUE GERMAN REICH OF FREEDOM AND OF HONOR A REAL FATHERLAND OF THE WHOLE GERMAN PEOPLE AND NOT AN ASYLUM FOR ALIEN SWINDLERS THERE IS TODAY CONSTANT TALK ABOUT 'FEDERALISM ETC I BEG YOU NOT TO ABUSE THE PRUSSIANS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME YOU GROVEL BEFORE THE JEWS BUT SHOW YOURSELVES STIFF NECKED AGAINST THE FOLK OF BERLIN AND IF YOU DO THAT THEN YOU WILL HAVE ON YOUR SIDE IN THE WHOLE OF GERMANY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF GERMANS WHETHER THEY BE PRUSSIANS OR MEN OF BADEN WURTTEMBERGERS MEN OF SAXONY OR GERMANS OF AUSTRIA NOW IS THE HOUR TO STAND STIFF NECKED AND RESIST TO THE LAST WE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS WHO FOR THREE YEARS HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT PREACH ABUSED AND INSULTED BY ALL BY SOME MOCKED AND SCORNED BY OTHERS TRADUCED AND SLANDERED WE CANNOT RETREAT FOR US THERE IS ONLY ONE PATH WHICH LEADS STRAIGHT AHEAD WE KNOW THAT THE FIGHT WHICH NOW IS BLAZING WILL BE A HARD STRUGGLE IT WILL NOT BE FOUGHT OUT IN THE COURT OF THE REICH AT LEIPZIG IT WILL NOT BE FOUGHT OUT IN A CABINET AT BERLIN IT WILL BE FOUGHT OUT THROUGH THOSE FACTORS WHICH IN THEIR HARD REALITY HAVE EVER UP TO THE PRESENT TIME MADE WORLD HISTORY I HEARD RECENTLY IN THE SPEECH OF A MINISTER THAT THE RIGHTS OF A STATE CANNOT BE SET ASIDE THROUGH SIMPLE MAJORITY DECISIONS BUT ONLY THROUGH TREATIES BISMARCK ONCE USED DIFFERENT LANGUAGE ON THIS SUBJECT HE THOUGHT THAT THE DESTINIES OF PEOPLES COULD BE DETERMINED NEITHER THROUGH MAJORITY DECISIONS NOR THROUGH TREATIES BUT ONLY THROUGH BLOOD AND IRON ON ONE POINT THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT WE WILL NOT LET THE JEWS SLIT OUR GULLETS AND NOT DEFEND OURSELVES TODAY IN BERLIN THEY MAY ALREADY BE ARRANGING THEIR FESTIVAL DINNERS WITH THE JEWISH HANGMEN OF SOVIET RUSSIA THAT THEY WILL NEVER DO HERE THEY MAY TODAY BEGIN TO SET UP THE CHEKA THE EXTRAORDINARY COMMISSION IN GERMANY THEY MAY GIVE IT FREE SCOPE WE SURRENDER TO SUCH A JEWISH COMMISSION NEVER WE HAVE THE CONVICTION FIRM AS A ROCK THAT IF IN THIS STATE SEVEN MILLION MEN ARE DETERMINED TO STAND BY THEIR 'NO' TO THE VERY LAST THE EVIL SPECTER WILL COLLAPSE INTO NOTHINGNESS IN THE REST OF THE REICH FOR WHAT GERMANY NEEDS TODAY WHAT GERMANY LONGS FOR ARDENTLY IS A SYMBOL OF POWER AND STRENGTH SO AS I COME TO THE END OF MY SPEECH I WANT TO ASK SOMETHING OF THOSE AMONG YOU WHO ARE YOUNG AND FOR THAT THERE IS A VERY SPECIAL REASON THE OLD PARTIES TRAIN THEIR YOUTH IN THE GIFT OF THE GAB WE PREFER TO TRAIN THEM TO USE THEIR BODILY STRENGTH FOR I TELL YOU THE YOUNG MAN WHO DOES NOT FIND HIS WAY TO THE PLACE WHERE IN THE LAST RESORT THE DESTINY OF HIS PEOPLE IS MOST TRULY REPRESENTED ONLY STUDIES PHILOSOPHY AND IN A TIME LIKE THIS BURIES HIMSELF BEHIND HIS BOOKS OR SITS AT HOME BY THE FIRE HE IS NO GERMAN YOUTH I CALL UPON YOU JOIN OUR STORM DIVISIONS AND HOWEVER MANY INSULTS AND SLANDERS YOU MAY HEAR IF YOU DO JOIN YOU ALL KNOW THAT THE STORM DIVISIONS HAVE BEEN FORMED FOR OUR PROTECTION FOR YOUR PROTECTION AND AT THE SAME TIME NOT MERELY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE MOVEMENT BUT FOR THE PROTECTION OF A GERMANY THAT IS TO BE IF YOU ARE REVILED AND INSULTED GOOD LUCK TO YOU MY BOYS YOU HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE ALREADY AT EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE TO BE HATED BY THE GREATEST OF SCOUNDRELS WHAT OTHERS CAN WIN ONLY AFTER A LIFETIME OF TOIL THIS HIGHEST GIFT OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE HONEST MAN AND THE BRIGAND FALLS AS A PIECE OF LUCK INTO YOUR LAP WHILE YOU ARE BUT YOUTHS YOU CAN BE ASSURED THAT THE MORE THEY REVILE YOU THE MORE WE RESPECT YOU WE KNOW THAT IF YOU WERE NOT THERE NONE OF US WOULD MAKE ANOTHER SPEECH WE KNOW WE SEE CLEARLY THAT OUR MOVEMENT WOULD BE CUDGELLED DOWN IF YOU DID NOT PROTECT IT YOU ARE THE DEFENSE OF A MOVEMENT THAT IS CALLED ONE DAY TO REMODEL GERMANY IN REVOLUTIONARY FASHION FROM ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS IN ORDER THAT THERE MAY COME TO BIRTH WHAT PERHAPS SO MANY EXPECTED ON THE NINTH OF NOVEMBER A GERMAN REICH AND A GERMANIC AND SO FAR AS IN US LIES A GERMAN REPUBLIC EVERY BATTLE MUST BE FOUGHT TO THE END BETTER THAT IT COME EARLY THAN LATE AND HE EVER STANDS MOST SECURELY WHO FROM THE FIRST GOES TO THE FIGHT WITH THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE AND THIS HIGHEST CONFIDENCE WE CAN CARRY WITH US IN OUR HEARTS FOR HE WHO ON OUR SIDE IS TODAY THE LEADER OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE GOD'S TRUTH HE HAS NOTHING TO WIN BUT PERHAPS ONLY EVERYTHING TO LOSE HE WHO TODAY FIGHTS ON OUR SIDE CANNOT WIN GREAT LAURELS FAR LESS CAN HE WIN GREAT MATERIAL GOODS IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT HE WILL END UP IN JAIL HE WHO TODAY IS LEADER MUST BE AN IDEALIST IF ONLY FOR THE REASON THAT HE LEADS THOSE AGAINST WHOM IT WOULD SEEM THAT EVERYTHING HAS CONSPIRED BUT IN THAT VERY FACT THERE LIES AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF STRENGTH THE CONVICTION THAT OUR MOVEMENT IS NOT SUSTAINED BY MONEY OR THE LUST FOR GOLD BUT ONLY BY OUR LOVE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT MUST EVER GIVE US FRESH HEART THAT MUST EVER FILL US WITH COURAGE FOR THE FRAY AND AS MY LAST WORD TAKE WITH YOU THIS ASSURANCE IF THIS BATTLE SHOULD NOT COME NEVER WOULD GERMANY WIN PEACE GERMANY WOULD DECAY AND AT THE BEST WOULD SINK TO RUIN LIKE A ROTTING CORPSE BUT THAT IS NOT OUR DESTINY WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS MISFORTUNE WHICH TODAY OUR GOD SENDS OVER GERMANY HAS NO MEANING IT IS SURELY THE SCOURGE WHICH SHOULD AND SHALL DRIVE US TO A NEW GREATNESS TO A NEW POWER AND GLORY TO A GERMANY WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME SHALL FULFILL THAT WHICH IN THEIR HEARTS MILLIONS OF THE BEST OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN HAVE HOPED FOR THROUGH THE CENTURIES AND THE MILLENNIA TO THE GERMANY OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE MUNICH

IT IS THIS TRAINING WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXTREMELY FEW CASUALTIES WHICH HARD AS THEY ARE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO BEAR ARE ON THE WHOLE FAR LESS THAN WE VENTURED TO EXPECT ADMITTEDLY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASUALTIES GIVES NO IDEA OF THE SEVERITY OF THE VARIOUS ENCOUNTERS FOR CERTAIN REGIMENTS AND DIVISIONS SUFFERED VERY HEAVY LOSSES WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED BY POLISH FORCES WHICH WERE NUMERICALLY SUPERIOR OR CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH SUCH FORCES WHEN THEY THEMSELVES WERE ATTACKING AS I AM NOW ABOUT TO MAKE KNOWN TO YOU THE NUMBER OF OUR DEAD AND WOUNDED I REQUEST THAT YOU RISE FROM YOUR SEATS THOUGH OWING TO THE TRAINING GIVEN OUR TROOPS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR WEAPONS AND THE COMMAND OF OUR FORCES THE FIGURES DO NOT AMOUNT TO EVEN ONE TWENTIETH OF WHAT OUR APPREHENSIONS HAD BEEN AT THE OUTSET OF THE CAMPAIGN WE WILL NEVER FORGET THAT EVERY SOLDIER WHO FELL FIGHTING BROUGHT FOR HIS PEOPLE AND OUR REICH THE GREATEST SACRIFICE THAT MAN CAN BRING ACCORDING TO THE CASUALTY LIST OF UP TO SEPTEMBER 30 1939 WHICH WILL NOT CHANGE MATERIALLY THE TOTAL LOSSES FOR THE ARMY NAVY AND AIR FORCE INCLUDING OFFICERS ARE AS FOLLOWS 10 572 KILLED 30 322 WOUNDED 3 404 MISSING UNFORTUNATELY OF THOSE MISSING A CERTAIN NUMBER WHO FELL INTO POLISH HANDS WILL PROBABLY BE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN MASSACRED AND KILLED ALL OUR GRATITUDE IS DUE TO THE VICTIMS OF THE CAMPAIGN IN POLAND WHILE THE WOUNDED MAY BE ASSURED OF OUR BEST ATTENTION AND CARE AND THE FAMILIES OF THOSE KILLED OF OUR SYMPATHY AND HELP BY THE CAPITULATION OF THE FORTRESSES OF WARSAW AND MODLIN AND THE SURRENDER OF HELA THE POLISH CAMPAIGN HAS COME TO AN END THE TASK OF SAFEGUARDING THE COUNTRY AGAINST VAGABONDING MARAUDERS GANGS OF ROBBERS AND INDIVIDUAL GROUPS OF TERRORISTS WILL BE CARRIED THROUGH WITH ALL ENERGY THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR WAS THE ANNIHILATION OF ALL POLISH ARMIES FOLLOWED BY THE DISSOLUTION OF THE POLISH STATE SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND PRISONERS HAVE SET OUT ON THEIR MARCH TO BERLIN THE AMOUNT OF WAR MATERIAL CAPTURED CANNOT YET BE ESTIMATED SINCE THE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR THE GERMAN FORCES HAVE AT THE SAME TIME IN CALM PREPAREDNESS TAKEN UP POSITIONS IN THE WEST READY TO MEET THE ENEMY THE NAVAL FORCES OF THE REICH HAVE FULFILLED THEIR DUTY IN THE ATTACK ON THE WESTERPLATTE GDYNIA OXHOEFT AND HELA AND IN PROTECTING THE BALTIC SEA AND THE GERMAN NORTH SEA COAST OUR SUBMARINES ARE FIGHTING IN A SPIRIT WORTHY OF THE MEMORY OF OUR HEROES IN THE LAST WAR IN THE FACE OF THIS HISTORICALLY UNPRECEDENTED COLLAPSE OF A STRUCTURE PURPORTING TO BE A STATE THE QUESTION IN ALMOST EVERYBODY'S MIND IS AS TO THE REASON FOR SUCH A PHENOMENON VERSAILLES WAS THE CRADLE OF A POLISH STATE WHICH HAD EMERGED FROM THE UNTOLD SACRIFICE OF BLOOD NOT OF POLISH BUT OF GERMAN AND RUSSIAN BLOOD POLAND WHO FOR CENTURIES PAST HAD PROVED HERSELF INCAPABLE OF EXISTENCE WAS IN 1916 ARTIFICIALLY BEGOTTEN AND IN 1919 NO LESS ARTIFICIALLY BORN BY A GERMAN GOVERNMENT JUST AS INCAPABLE OF EXISTENCE IN UTTER DISREGARD OF ALMOST 500 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THE LESSON OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT DURING MANY CENTURIES WITHOUT APPRECIATION FOR ETHNOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS AND WITH NO REGARD FOR ALL ECONOMIC EXPEDIENCIES A STATE WAS CONSTRUCTED AT VERSAILLES WHICH ACCORDING TO ITS WHOLE NATURE WAS SOONER OR LATER BOUND TO BECOME THE CAUSE OF A MOST SERIOUS CRISIS A MAN WHO I AM SORRY TO SAY NOW RANKS AMONG OUR FIERCEST ENEMIES AT THAT TIME CLEARLY FORESAW ALL THIS I MEAN MR LLOYD GEORGE LIKE SO MANY OTHERS HE SOUNDED WARNING NOT ONLY AT THE TIME OF THE CREATION OF THAT STRUCTURE BUT ALSO IN THE COURSE OF ITS SUBSEQUENT EXPANSION WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN UTTER DISREGARD OF REASON AND RIGHT AT THAT TIME HE EXPRESSED APPREHENSION THAT IN THAT STATE AN ACCUMULATION OF CONDITIONS WAS BEING CREATED CONTAINING THE RISK OF CONFLICTS WHICH SOONER OR LATER MIGHT LEAD TO GREAT EUROPEAN COMPLICATIONS AS A MATTER OF FACT CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THE STRUCTURE OF THIS NEW SO CALLED STATE AS FAR AS ITS NATIONALITIES WERE CONCERNED COULD NOT BE CLARIFIED UNTIL NOW IT REQUIRES SOME KNOWLEDGE OF POLISH CENSUS METHODS TO REALIZE HOW UTTERLY ALIEN TO TRUTH AND THEREFORE IRRELEVANT STATISTICS ON THE NATIONAL COMPOSITION OF THAT TERRITORY WERE AND ARE IN 1919 THE POLES LAID CLAIMS TO THE TERRITORY WHERE THEY PRETENDED TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF 95 PER CENT IN EAST PRUSSIA FOR INSTANCE WHEREAS A PLEBISCITE LATER SHOWED THE POLES ACTUALLY HAD REACHED A FIGURE OF 2 PER CENT IN THE STATE FINALLY CREATED WHICH CONTAINED PARTS OF FORMER RUSSIA AUSTRIA AND GERMANY NON POLISH ELEMENTS WERE SO BRUTALLY ILL TREATED SUPPRESSED TYRANNIZED AND TORTURED THAT ANY PLEBISCITE DEPENDED ENTIRELY ON THE GOOD WILL OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS FOR PRODUCING SUCH RESULTS AS WERE DESIRED OR DEMANDED NOR DID INDISPUTABLE POLISH ELEMENTS RECEIVE MUCH BETTER RECOGNITION AND THEN ON TOP OF ALL THIS STATESMEN OF OUR WESTERN HEMISPHERE SPOKE OF THIS KIND OF CREATION AS OF DEMOCRACY OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THEIR OWN SYSTEM IN THAT COUNTRY THERE RULED A MINORITY OF ARISTOCRATIC OR NON ARISTOCRATIC LARGE VAST ESTATE OWNERS AND WEALTHY INTELLECTUALS TO WHOM UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THEIR OWN POLISH COMPATRIOTS WERE NOTHING BUT MASS MAN POWER FOR THAT REASON THE REGIME WAS NEVER BACKED BY MORE THAN 15 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION THE ECONOMIC DISTRESS AND LOW CULTURAL LEVEL CORRESPONDED WITH THESE CONDITIONS IN 1919 THIS STATE TOOK OVER FROM PRUSSIA AND ALSO FROM AUSTRIA PROVINCES WHICH HAD BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF HARD TOIL SOME OF
THEM BEING IN A MOST FLOURISHING CONDITION TODAY AFTER THE ELAPSE OF TWENTY YEARS THEY ARE AT A POINT OF GRADUALLY TURNING INTO STEPPES AGAIN THE VISTULA THE RIVER WHOSE ESTUARY HAS ALWAYS BEEN OF SUCH TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE FOR THE POLISH GOVERNMENT OWING TO THE LACK OF ANY AND ALL CARE IS NOW ALREADY UNSUITABLE FOR ANY REAL TRAFFIC AND DEPENDING ON THE SEASON IS EITHER AN UNRULY STREAM OR A DRIED UP RIVULET TOWNS AS WELL AS VILLAGES ARE IN A STATE OF NEGLECT THE ROADS WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS ARE BADLY OUT OF REPAIR AND IN A TERRIBLE CONDITION ANYONE WHO TRAVELS IN THAT COUNTRY FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS WILL GET THE PROPER IDEA OF THE CLASSICAL GERMAN TERM 'POLNISCHE WIRTSCHAFT MEANING A 'POLISH STATE OF AFFAIRS 'IN SPITE OF THE UNBEARABLE CONDITIONS PREVAILING IN THAT COUNTRY GERMANY ENDEAVORED TO ESTABLISH PEACEFUL RELATIONS WITH IT DURING THE YEARS 1933 AND 1934 I ENDEAVORED TO FIND SOME EQUITABLE COMPROMISE BETWEEN OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AND OUR DESIRE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE WITH THAT COUNTRY THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MARSHAL PILSUDSKI WAS STILL ALIVE WHEN IT SEEMED POSSIBLE FOR THIS HOPE TO MATERIALIZE WERE IT ONLY TO A MODEST EXTENT UNLIMITED PATIENCE AND STILL GREATER SELF RESTRAINT WERE CALLED FOR BECAUSE MANY OF THE REGIONAL POLISH ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS TOOK THE UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN GERMANY AND POLAND TO BE MERELY A LICENSE FOR THE PERSECUTION AND ANNIHILATION OF THE GERMANS IN POLAND WITH EVEN LESS RISK IN THE FEW YEARS UP TO 1922 MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF MILLION GERMANS HAD BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES THEY WERE HUNTED OUT OFTEN WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE EVEN THEIR MOST NECESSARY CLOTHING WHEN IN 1938 THE OLSA TERRITORY WENT TO POLAND THEY USED THE SAME METHODS AGAINST THE CZECHS WHO LIVED THERE OFTEN WITHIN A FEW HOURS MANY THOUSANDS OF THESE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR WORKING PLACES THEIR HOMES THEIR VILLAGES AND TOWNS AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE WITHOUT BEING ALLOWED TO TAKE ANYTHING MORE WITH THEM THAN A SUITCASE OR A LITTLE BOX WITH CLOTHING THINGS LIKE THIS WENT ON FOR YEARS AND FOR YEARS WE LOOKED ON ALWAYS STRIVING TO ATTAIN SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE LOT OF THE UNHAPPY GERMANS LIVING THERE BY ESTABLISHING CLOSER RELATIONS IT WAS HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT EVERY GERMAN ATTEMPT THEREBY TO SECURE THE REMOVAL OF THESE INTOLERABLE CONDITIONS WAS TAKEN BY THE POLISH RULERS TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A SIGN OF WEAKNESS IF NOT OF STUPIDITY WHEN THE POLISH GOVERNMENT PROCEEDED IN A THOUSAND WAYS GRADUALLY TO SUBJUGATE DANZIG AS WELL I ENDEAVORED BY MEANS OF PRACTICAL PROPOSALS TO SECURE A SOLUTION WHEREBY DANZIG IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WISHES OF ITS POPULATION COULD BE NATIONALLY AND POLITICALLY UNITED WITH GERMANY WITHOUT IMPAIRING THE ECONOMIC NEEDS AND SO CALLED RIGHTS OF POLAND IF TODAY ANY ONE ALLEGES THAT THESE WERE ULTIMATIVE DEMANDS THAT ALLEGATION IS A LIE THE PROPOSALS FOR A SOLUTION AS COMMUNICATED TO THE POLISH GOVERNMENT IN MARCH 1939 WERE NOTHING BUT THE SUGGESTIONS AND THE IDEAS ALREADY DISCUSSED LONG AGO BETWEEN MYSELF AND POLISH FOREIGN MINISTER BECK EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IN THE SPRING OF 1939 I THOUGHT I WOULD BE ABLE TO FACILITATE THE ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PROPOSALS BY THE POLISH GOVERNMENT IN THE FACE OF THEIR OWN PUBLIC OPINION BY THE OFFER TO CONCEDE TO THEM AN EQUIVALENT THE FACT THAT THE POLISH GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME REFUSED TO CONSIDER A DISCUSSION OF THESE PROPOSALS WAS DUE TO TWO REASONS FOR ONE THING THE INFLAMED CHAUVINIST POWERS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT NEVER INTENDED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF DANZIG BUT ON THE CONTRARY ALREADY LIVED IN THE HOPE EXPOUNDED LATER IN PUBLICATIONS AND SPEECHES OF ACQUIRING TERRITORY FROM THE REICH FAR BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF DANZIG IN FACT THEY HOPED TO BE IN A POSITION TO ATTACK AND CONQUER 'THESE AIMS FAR FROM STOPPING AT EAST PRUSSIA WERE CLIMAXED BY A FLOOD OF PUBLICATIONS AND A CONTINUOUS SEQUENCE OF SPEECHES ADDRESSES RESOLUTIONS ETC IN ADDITION TO THE INCORPORATION OF EAST PRUSSIA FOR THE ANNEXATION OF POMERANIA AND SILESIA THE ODER REPRESENTED THE MINIMUM OF FRONTIER CLAIMS AND FINALLY EVEN THE ELBE WAS DESCRIBED AS THE NATURAL DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN GERMANY AND POLAND THESE DEMANDS WHICH TODAY MAY APPEAR CRAZY BUT WHICH WERE THEN PRESENTED WITH FANATICAL SERIOUSNESS WERE BASED IN A SIMPLY RIDICULOUS MANNER ON THE ASSUMPTION OF A 'POLISH MISSION OF CIVILIZATION' AND DECLARED JUSTIFIED BECAUSE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE CAPABLE OF FULFILLMENT IN VIEW OF THE STRENGTH OF THE POLISH ARMY WHILE I WAS INVITING THE THEN POLISH FOREIGN MINISTER TO TAKE PART IN A CONFERENCE FOR THE DISCUSSION OF OUR PROPOSALS THE POLISH MILITARY GENERALS WERE ALREADY WRITING ABOUT THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE GERMAN ARMY THE COWARDICE OF THE GERMAN SOLDIERS THE INFERIORITY OF THE GERMAN WEAPONS THE OBVIOUS SUPERIORITY OF THE POLISH FORCES AND THE CERTAINTY IN CASE OF WAR OF DEFEATING THE GERMANS AT THE GATES OF BERLIN AND OF ANNIHILATING THE REICH THE MAN HOWEVER WHO INTENDED AS HE EXPRESSED IT TO HACK THE GERMAN ARMY TO PIECES AT THE GATES OF BERLIN WAS NOT JUST AN ILLITERATE INSIGNIFICANT POLE BUT THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF RYDZ SMIGLY WHO AT PRESENT RESIDES IN RUMANIA VIOLATIONS AND INSULTS WHICH GERMANY AND HER ARMED FORCES HAD TO PUT UP WITH FROM THESE MILITARY DILETTANTES WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN TOLERATED BY ANY OTHER STATE JUST AS THEY WERE NOT EXPECTED FROM ANY OTHER NATION NO FRENCH OR ENGLISH GENERALS WOULD EVER HAVE PRESUMED TO EXPRESS A JUDGMENT OF THE GERMAN
ARMED FORCES SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH WE HEARD READ FROM THE POLISH SIDE FOR YEARS PARTICULARLY SINCE MARCH 1939 AND ON THE OTHER HAND NO GERMAN GENERAL WOULD HAVE SPOKEN IN THAT MANNER OF ENGLISH FRENCH OR ITALIAN SOLDIERS A GREAT DEAL OF SELF CONTROL WAS NEEDED TO KEEP CALM IN FACE OF THESE SIMPLY SHAMELESS INSULTS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT WE KNEW THAT THE GERMAN ARMED FORCES COULD DESTROY AND SWEEP AWAY THE WHOLE OF THIS RIDICULOUS STATE AND ITS ARMY WITHIN A FEW WEEKS BUT THIS ATTITUDE FOR WHICH THE POLISH LEADERS THEMSELVES WERE RESPONSIBLE WAS THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON WHY THE POLISH GOVERNMENT REFUSED EVEN TO DISCUSS THE GERMAN PROPOSALS ANOTHER REASON WAS THAT FATAL PROMISE OF GUARANTEE GIVEN TO THE STATE WHICH ALTHOUGH NOT MENACED AT ALL VERY RAPIDLY BECAME CONVINCED IT COULD AFFORD TO CHALLENGE A GREAT POWER WITHOUT RISK ONCE IT WAS ASSURED OF THE SUPPORT OF TWO GREAT POWERS PERHAPS EVEN HOPING THIS WAY TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR REALIZATION OF ALL ITS OWN INSANE AMBITIONS FOR AS SOON AS POLAND FELT CERTAIN OF THAT GUARANTEE MINORITIES LIVING IN THAT COUNTRY HAD TO SUFFER WHAT AMOUNTED TO A REIGN OF TERROR I DO NOT CONSIDER IT MY TASK TO SPEAK OF THE LOT OF THE UKRAINIANS OR WHITE RUSSIAN POPULATION WHOSE INTERESTS NOW LIE IN THE HANDS OF RUSSIA HOWEVER I DO FEEL IT MY DUTY TO SPEAK OF THE LOT OF THOSE HELPLESS THOUSANDS OF GERMANS WHO CARRIED ON THE TRADITION OF THOSE WHO FIRST BROUGHT CULTURE TO THAT COUNTRY CENTURIES AGO AND WHOM THE POLES NOW BEGAN TO OPPRESS AND DRIVE OUT SINCE MARCH 1939 THEY HAD BEEN VICTIMS OF TRULY SATANIC TERRORIZATION HOW MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN ABDUCTED AND WHERE THEY ARE CANNOT BE STATED EVEN TODAY VILLAGES WITH HUNDREDS OF GERMAN INHABITANTS ARE NOW LEFT WITHOUT MEN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE BEEN KILLED IN OTHERS WOMEN WERE VIOLATED AND MURDERED GIRLS AND CHILDREN OUTRAGED AND KILLED IN 1598 AN ENGLISHMAN SIR GEORGE CAREW WROTE IN HIS DIPLOMATIC REPORTS TO THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT THAT THE OUTSTANDING FEATURES OF POLISH CHARACTER WERE CRUELTY AND LACK OF MORAL RESTRAINT SINCE THAT TIME THIS CRUELTY HAS NOT CHANGED JUST AS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GERMANS WERE SLAUGHTERED AND SADISTICALLY TORMENTED TO DEATH SO GERMAN SOLDIERS CAPTURED IN FIGHTING WERE TORTURED AND MASSACRED THIS PET LAPDOG OF THE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A CULTURED NATION AT ALL FOR MORE THAN FOUR YEARS I FOUGHT IN THE GREAT WAR ON THE WESTERN FRONT BUT SUCH THINGS DID NOT HAPPEN ON EITHER SIDE THINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN POLAND IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND ESPECIALLY THE LAST FOUR WEEKS CONSTITUTE FLAMING ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CREATION OF A SO CALLED STATE LACKING EVERY NATIONAL HISTORICAL CULTURAL AND MORAL FOUNDATION HAD ONLY 1 PER CENT OF THESE ATROCITIES BEEN COMMITTED IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD AGAINST THE ENGLISH PEOPLE I SHOULD BE INTERESTED TO SEE THE INDIGNATION OF THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO TODAY IN HYPOCRITICAL HORROR CONDEMN THE GERMAN OR RUSSIAN PROCEDURE NO TO GRANT GUARANTEES TO THIS STATE AND THIS GOVERNMENT AS WAS DONE COULD ONLY LEAD TO APPALLING DISASTERS NEITHER THE POLISH GOVERNMENT NOR THE SMALL CLIQUES SUPPORTING IT NOR THE POLISH NATION AS SUCH WERE CAPABLE OF MEASURING THE RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH WERE IMPLIED IN SUCH GUARANTEES IN POLAND'S FAVOR BY HALF OF EUROPE THE PASSIONATE SENTIMENT THUS AROUSED TOGETHER WITH THE SENSE OF THAT SECURITY WHICH HAD BEEN UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED TO THEM COUNTED FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF THE POLISH GOVERNMENT DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN APRIL AND AUGUST THIS YEAR IT WAS ALSO THE CAUSE OF THE ATTITUDE THEY ADOPTED TOWARD MY CONCILIATORY PROPOSALS THE GOVERNMENT REJECTED THESE PROPOSALS BECAUSE THEY FELT THEMSELVES PROTECTED OR EVEN ENCOURAGED BY PUBLIC OPINION AND PUBLIC OPINION PROTECTED THEM AND ENCOURAGED THEM ON THEIR WAY BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN LEFT IN IGNORANCE BY ITS GOVERNMENT AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IN ITS EVERY ACTION IT FELT ITSELF SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED FROM WITHOUT ALL THIS LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF APPALLING ATROCITIES COMMITTED AGAINST GERMAN NATIONALS IN POLAND AND TO THE REJECTION OF ALL PROPOSALS FOR A SOLUTION AND IN THE END TO THE STEADILY GROWING ENCROACHMENTS ON ACTUAL REICH TERRITORY IT WAS QUITE COMPREHENSIBLE THAT SUCH A STATE OF MIND INTERPRETED GERMAN LONGSUFFERING AS A WEAKNESS THAT IS THAT EVERY CONCESSION ON GERMANY'S PART WAS REGARDED AS PROOF OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME FURTHER AGGRESSIVE STEPS A WARNING GIVEN POLAND TO REFRAIN FROM SENDING DANZIG ANY MORE NOTES AMOUNTING TO ULTIMATA AND ABOVE ALL TO DESIST FROM ECONOMIC STRANGULATION OF THAT CITY DID NOT EASE THE SITUATION IN THE LEAST IT RESULTED IN FACT IN COMPLETE STOPPAGE OF ALL DANZIG MEANS OF COMMUNICATION THE WARNING TO SUSPEND OR AT LEAST TO TAKE STEPS AGAINST THE UNCEASING CASES OF MURDER ILL TREATMENT AND TORTURE OF GERMAN NATIONALS IN POLAND HAD THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THESE ATROCITIES AND OF CALLING FOR MORE BLOODTHIRSTY HARANGUES AND PROVOCATIVE SPEECHES FROM THE POLISH LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES THE GERMAN PROPOSALS AIMING AT A LAST MINUTE AGREEMENT ON A JUST AND EQUITABLE BASIS WERE ANSWERED BY A GENERAL MOBILIZATION THE GERMAN REQUEST THAT AN INTERMEDIARY SHOULD BE SENT FOUNDED ON A PROPOSAL MADE BY GREAT BRITAIN WAS NOT COMPLIED WITH AND ON THE SECOND DAY WAS ANSWERED BY AN OFFENSIVE DECLARATION UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT IF FURTHER INCURSIONS INTO THE REICH'S TERRITORY OCCURRED GERMANY'S PATIENCE WOULD BE AT AN END
WHAT THE POLES HAD ERRONEOUSLY INTERPRETED AS WEAKNESS WAS IN REALITY OUR SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND MY FIRM DETERMINATION TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING IF THAT AT ALL WAS POSSIBLE SINCE THEY BELIEVED THAT THIS PATIENCE AND LONGSUFFERING WAS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS WHICH WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO ANYTHING NO OTHER COURSE REMAINED THAN TO SHOW THEM THEIR MISTAKE BY STRIKING BACK WITH THE WEAPONS WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAD USED FOR YEARS UNDER THESE BLOWS THEIR STATE HAS CRUMBLED TO PIECES IN A FEW WEEKS AND IS NOW SWEPT FROM THE EARTH ONE OF THE MOST SENSELESS DEEDS PERPETRATED AT VERSAILLES IS THUS A THING OF THE PAST IF THIS STEP ON GERMANY'S PART HAS RESULTED IN A COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS WITH RUSSIA THAT IS DUE NOT ONLY TO THE SIMILARITY OF THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE TWO STATES BUT ALSO TO THAT OF THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH BOTH STATES HAD ARRIVED AT WITH REGARD TO THEIR FUTURE RELATIONSHIP IN MY SPEECH AT DANZIG I ALREADY DECLARED THAT RUSSIA WAS ORGANIZED ON PRINCIPLES WHICH DIFFER FROM THOSE HELD IN GERMANY HOWEVER SINCE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT STALIN FOUND NOTHING IN THE RUSSIAN SOVIET PRINCIPLES WHICH SHOULD PREVENT HIM FROM CULTIVATING FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH STATES OF A DIFFERENT POLITICAL CREED NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMANY SEES NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD ADOPT ANOTHER CRITERION THE SOVIET UNION IS THE SOVIET UNION NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMANY IS NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMANY BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN FROM THE MOMENT WHEN THE TWO STATES MUTUALLY AGREED TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S DISTINCTIVE REGIME AND PRINCIPLES EVERY REASON FOR ANY MUTUALLY HOSTILE ATTITUDE HAD DISAPPEARED LONG PERIODS IN THE HISTORY OF BOTH NATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THESE TWO LARGEST STATES IN EUROPE WERE NEVER HAPPIER THAN WHEN THEY LIVED IN FRIENDSHIP WITH EACH OTHER THE GREAT WAR WHICH ONCE MADE GERMANY AND RUSSIA ENEMIES WAS DISASTROUS FOR BOTH COUNTRIES IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CAPITALIST STATES OF THE WEST ARE INTERESTED TODAY IN PLAYING OFF THESE TWO STATES AND THEIR PRINCIPLES AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR THIS PURPOSE AND UNTIL IT IS REALIZED THEY CERTAINLY REGARD THE SOVIET UNION AS A SUFFICIENTLY RESPECTABLE PARTNER FOR THE CONCLUSION OF A USEFUL MILITARY PACT BUT THEY REGARD IT AS PERFIDY THAT THEIR HONORABLE APPROACHES WERE REJECTED AND IN THEIR PLACE RAPPROCHEMENT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THOSE TWO VERY POWERS WHO HAD EVERY REASON FOR SEEKING HAPPINESS FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE PEOPLES IN DEVELOPING THEIR ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP ALONG THE LINES OF PEACEFUL CO OPERATION MONTHS AGO I STATED IN THE REICHSTAG THAT THE CONCLUSION OF THE GERMAN RUSSIAN NON AGGRESSION PACT MARKED THE TURNING POINT IN THE WHOLE GERMAN FOREIGN POLICY THE NEW PACT OF FRIENDSHIP AND MUTUAL INTEREST SINCE SIGNED BETWEEN GERMANY AND THE SOVIET UNION WILL INSURE NOT ONLY PEACE BUT A CONSTANT SATISFACTORY CO OPERATION FOR BOTH STATES GERMANY AND RUSSIA TOGETHER WILL RELIEVE ONE OF THE MOST ACUTE DANGER SPOTS IN EUROPE OF ITS THREATENING CHARACTER AND WILL EACH IN HER OWN SPHERE CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELFARE OF THE PEOPLES LIVING THERE THUS AIDING TO EUROPEAN PEACE IN GENERAL IF CERTAIN CIRCLES TODAY SEE IN THIS PACT EITHER THE BREAKDOWN OF RUSSIA OR GERMANY AS SUITS THEM BEST I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE THEM MY ANSWER FOR MANY YEARS IMAGINARY AIMS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO GERMANY'S FOREIGN POLICY WHICH AT BEST MIGHT BE TAKEN TO HAVE ARISEN IN THE MIND OF A SCHOOLBOY AT A MOMENT WHEN GERMANY IS STRUGGLING TO CONSOLIDATE HER OWN LIVING SPACE WHICH ONLY CONSISTS OF A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE KILOMETERS INSOLENT JOURNALISTS IN COUNTRIES WHICH RULE OVER 40 000 000 SQUARE KILOMETERS STATE GERMANY IS ASPIRING TO WORLD DOMINATION GERMAN RUSSIAN AGREEMENTS SHOULD PROVE IMMENSELY COMFORTING TO THESE WORRIED SPONSORS OF UNIVERSAL LIBERTY FOR DO THEY NOT SHOW MOST EMPHATICALLY THAT THEIR ASSERTIONS AS TO GERMANY'S AIMING AT D DOMINATION OF THE URALS THE UKRAINE RUMANIA ETC ARE ONLY EXCRESCENCES OF THEIR OWN UNHEALTHY WAR LORD FANTASY IN ONE RESPECT IT IS TRUE GERMANY'S DECISION IS IRREVOCABLE NAMELY IN HER INTENTION TO SEE PEACEFUL STABLE AND THUS TOLERABLE CONDITIONS INTRODUCED ON HER EASTERN FRONTIERS ALSO IT IS PRECISELY HERE THAT GERMANY'S INTERESTS AND DESIRES CORRESPOND ENTIRELY WITH THOSE OF THE SOVIET UNION THE TWO STATES ARE RESOLVED TO PREVENT PROBLEMATIC CONDITIONS ARISING BETWEEN THEM WHICH CONTAIN GERMS OF INTERNAL UNREST AND THUS ALSO OF EXTERNAL DISORDER AND WHICH MIGHT PERHAPS IN ANY WAY UNFAVORABLY AFFECT THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE TWO GREAT STATES WITH ONE ANOTHER GERMANY AND THE SOVIET UNION HAVE THEREFORE CLEARLY DEFINED THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR OWN SPHERES OF INTEREST WITH THE INTENTION OF BEING SINGLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LAW AND ORDER AND PREVENTING EVERYTHING WHICH MIGHT CAUSE INJURY TO THE OTHER PARTNER THE AIMS AND TASKS WHICH EMERGE FROM THE COLLAPSE OF THE POLISH STATE ARE INSOFAR AS THE GERMAN SPHERE OF INTEREST IS CONCERNED ROUGHLY AS FOLLOWS 1 DEMARCATION OF THE BOUNDARY FOR THE REICH WHICH WILL DO JUSTICE TO HISTORICAL ETHNOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTS 2 PACIFICATION OF THE WHOLE TERRITORY BY RESTORING A TOLERABLE MEASURE OF PEACE AND ORDER 3 ABSOLUTE GUARANTEES OF SECURITY NOT ONLY AS FAR AS REICH TERRITORY IS CONCERNED BUT FOR THE ENTIRE SPHERE OF INTEREST 4
RE ESTABLISHMENT AND REORGANIZATION OF ECONOMIC LIFE AND OF TRADE AND TRANSPORT INVOLVING DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION 5 AS THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK HOWEVER TO ESTABLISH A NEW ORDER OF ETHNOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS THAT IS TO SAY RESETTLE MENT OF NATIONALITIES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE PROCESS ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN THE OBTAINING OF BETTER DIVIDING LINES THAN IS THE CASE AT PRESENT IN THIS SENSE HOWEVER IT IS NOT A CASE OF THE PROBLEM BEING RESTRICTED TO THIS PARTICULAR SPHERE BUT OF A TASK WITH FAR WIDER IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EAST AND SOUTH OF EUROPE ARE TO A LARGE EXTENT FILLED WITH SPLINTERS OF THE GERMAN NATIONALITY WHOSE EXISTENCE THEY CANNOT MAINTAIN IN THEIR VERY EXISTENCE LIE THE REASON AND CAUSE FOR CONTINUAL INTERNATIONAL DISTURBANCES IN THIS AGE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALITIES AND OF RACIAL IDEALS IT IS UTOPIAN TO BELIEVE THAT MEMBERS OF A HIGHLY DEVELOPED PEOPLE CAN BE ASSIMILATED WITHOUT TROUBLE IT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL FOR A FAR SIGHTED ORDERING OF THE LIFE OF EUROPE THAT A RESETTLEMENT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN HERE SO AS TO REMOVE AT LEAST PART OF THE MATERIAL FOR EUROPEAN CONFLICT GERMANY AND THE UNION OF SOVIET REPUBLICS HAVE COME TO AN AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN THIS MATTER THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT WILL THEREFORE NEVER ALLOW THE RESIDUAL POLISH STATE OF THE FUTURE TO BECOME IN ANY SENSE A DISTURBING FACTOR FOR THE REICH ITSELF AND STILL LESS A SOURCE OF DISTURBANCE BETWEEN THE GERMAN REICH AND SOVIET RUSSIA AS GERMANY AND SOVIET RUSSIA UNDERTAKE THIS WORK OF RE ESTABLISHMENT THE TWO STATES ARE ENTITLED TO POINT OUT THAT THE ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY THE METHODS OF VERSAILLES HAS PROVED AN UTTER FAILURE IN FACT IT HAD TO FAIL BECAUSE THESE TASKS CANNOT BE SETTLED SITTING AROUND A TABLE OR BY SIMPLE DECREES MOST OF THE STATESMEN WHO IN VERSAILLES HAD TO DECIDE ON THESE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS DID NOT POSSESS THE SLIGHTEST HISTORICAL TRAINING INDEED THEY OFTEN HAD NOT EVEN THE VAGUEST IDEA OF THE NATURE OF THE TASK WITH WHICH THEY WERE FACED NEITHER DID THEY BEAR ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTION RECOGNITION THAT THEIR WORK MIGHT BE FAULTY WAS OF NO SIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE IN PRACTICE THERE WAS NO WAY FOR A REAL REVISION IT IS TRUE THAT IN THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES PROVISION WAS MADE FOR KEEPING OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH REVISIONS BUT IN REALITY ALL ATTEMPTS TO ATTAIN SUCH A REVISION MISCARRIED AND THEY WERE BOUND TO MISCARRY BECAUSE THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS AS THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY WAS NO LONGER MORALLY JUSTIFIED TO CARRY OUT SUCH A PROCEDURE AFTER AMERICA HAD BEEN FIRST TO REFUSE TO RATIFY THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES OR TO JOIN THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS AND LATER WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO FELT THEY COULD NO LONGER RECONCILE THEIR PRESENCE IN THIS ORGANIZATION WITH THE INTERESTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES THE LEAGUE DEGENERATED MORE AND MORE INTO A CLIQUE OF PARTIES INTERESTED IN THE VERSAILLES DICTATE AT ANY RATE IT IS A FACT THAT NONE OF THE REVISIONS RECOGNIZED FROM THE OUTSET AS NECESSARY HAD EVER BEEN EFFECTED BY THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS SINCE IN OUR TIME IT BECAME CUSTOMARY TO REGARD A REFUGEE GOVERNMENT AS STILL EXISTING EVEN IF IT CONSISTS OF THREE MEMBERS PROVIDED THEY HAVE TAKEN WITH THEM SUFFICIENT GOLD SO AS NOT TO BE AN ECONOMIC BURDEN TO THE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY OFFERING HOSPITALITY IT MAY BE ASSUMED THAT THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS TOO WILL CARRY ON BRAVELY IF BUT TWO NATIONS SIT THERE TOGETHER PERHAPS EVEN ONE WILL DO BUT ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE LEAGUE ANY REVISION OF THE VERSAILLES CLAUSES WOULD STILL BE ADJUDICATED EXCLUSIVELY BY THIS ILLUSTRIOUS ORGANIZATION THAT IS IN OTHER WORDS REVISION WOULD BE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS IS NOT LIVING BUT ALREADY A DEAD THING NEVERTHELESS THE PEOPLES CONCERNED ARE NOT DEAD BUT ALIVE AND THEY WILL UPHOLD THEIR VITAL INTERESTS HOWEVER INCAPABLE THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS MAY BE OF SEEING GRASPING OR RESPECTING THOSE INTERESTS NATIONAL SOCIALISM IS NOT A PHENOMENON WHICH HAS GROWN UP IN GERMANY WITH THE MALICIOUS INTENT OF THWARTING LEAGUE EFFORTS AT REVISION BUT A MOVEMENT WHICH AROSE BECAUSE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THE MOST NATURAL HUMAN AND SOCIAL RIGHTS OF A GREAT NATION HAD BEEN SUPPRESSED AND DENIED REDRESS AND I PERSONALLY TAKE EXCEPTION AT SEEING FOREIGN STATES MEN STAND UP AND CALL ME GUILTY OF HAVING BROKEN MY WORD BECAUSE I HAVE NOW PUT THESE REVISIONS THROUGH ON THE CONTRARY I PLEDGED MY SACRED WORD TO THE GERMAN PEOPLE TO DO AWAY WITH THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES AND TO RESTORE TO THEM THEIR NATURAL AND VITAL RIGHTS AS A GREAT NATION THE EXTENT TO WHICH I AM SECURING THESE VITAL RIGHTS IS MODEST THIS I ASK IF FORTY SIX MILLION ENGLISHMEN CLAIM THE RIGHT TO RULE OVER FORTY MILLION SQUARE KILOMETERS OF THE EARTH IT CANNOT BE WRONG FOR EIGHTY TWO MILLION GERMANS TO DEMAND THE RIGHT TO LIVE ON 800 000 SQUARE KILOMETERS TO TILL THEIR FIELDS AND TO FOLLOW THEIR TRADES AND CALLINGS AND IF THEY FURTHER DEMAND THE RESTITUTION OF THOSE COLONIAL POSSESSIONS WHICH FORMERLY WERE THEIR PROPERTY WHICH THEY HAD NOT TAKEN AWAY FROM ANYBODY BY ROBBERY OR WAR BUT HONESTLY ACQUIRED BY PURCHASE EXCHANGE AND TREATIES MOREOVER IN ALL MY DEMANDS I ALWAYS FIRST TRIED TO OBTAIN REVISIONS BY WAY OF NEGOTIATION I DID IT IS TRUE REFUSE TO SUBMIT THE QUESTION OF GERMAN VITAL RIGHTS TO SOME NON COMPETENT INTERNATIONAL BODY IN THE FORM OF HUMBLE REQUESTS JUST AS LITTLE AS I SUPPOSE THAT GREAT BRITAIN WOULD PLEAD FOR RESPECT OF HER VITAL INTERESTS SO LITTLE OUGHT ONE TO EXPECT THE SAME OF NATIONAL SOCIALIST
GERMANY I HAVE HOWEVER AND I MUST EMPHASIZE THIS FACT MOST SOLEMNLY LIMITED IN THE EXTREME THE MEASURE OF THESE REVISIONS OF THE VERSAILLES TREATY NOTABLY IN ALL THOSE CASES WHERE I DID NOT SEE ANY MENACE TO THE NATURAL VITAL INTERESTS OF MY PEOPLE I HAVE MYSELF ADVISED THE GERMAN NATION TO HOLD BACK YET THESE EIGHTY MILLION PEOPLE MUST LIVE SOMEWHERE THERE EXISTS A FACT THAT NOT EVEN THE VERSAILLES TREATY HAS BEEN ABLE TO DESTROY ALTHOUGH IT HAS IN THE MOST UNREASONABLE MANNER DISSOLVED STATES TORN ASUNDER REGIONS ECONOMICALLY CONNECTED CUT COMMUNICATION LINES ETC YET THE PEOPLE THE LIVING SUBSTANCE OF FLESH AND BLOOD HAS REMAINED AND WILL FOREVER REMAIN IN THE FUTURE IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT SINCE THE GERMAN PEOPLE HAS FOUND ITS RESURRECTION THROUGH NATIONAL SOCIALISM THE RELATION EXISTING BETWEEN GERMANY AND THE SURROUNDING NATIONS HAS BEEN CLEARED UP TO A GREAT EXTENT THE UNCERTAINTY THAT TODAY IS WEIGHING DOWN THE COMMON LIFE OF NATIONS IS NOT DUE TO GERMAN DEMANDS BUT TO THE MALIGNANT INSINUATIONS PUBLISHED IN THE SO CALLED DEMOCRACIES THE GERMAN DEMANDS THEMSELVES WERE FORMULATED IN A VERY CLEAR AND PRECISE WAY THEY HAVE IT IS TRUE FOUND THEIR FULFILLMENT NOT THANKS TO THE INSIGHT OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS BUT THANKS TO THE DYNAMICS OF NATURAL DEVELOPMENT THE AIM OF THE GERMAN FOREIGN POLICY AS PURSUED BY ME HAS NEVER BEEN OTHER THAN TO GUARANTEE THE EXISTENCE THAT IS TO SAY THE LIFE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE TO REMOVE THE INJUSTICE AND NONSENSE CONTAINED IN A TREATY WHICH NOT ONLY DESTROYED GERMANY ECONOMICALLY BUT HAS DRAWN THE VICTOR NATIONS INTO DISASTER AS WELL FOR THE REST HOWEVER OUR WHOLE WORK OF REBUILDING WAS CONCERNED WITH THE HOME AFFAIRS OF THE REICH AND NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAD A GREATER LONGING FOR PEACE THAN THE GERMAN PEOPLE IT WAS FORTUNATE FOR HUMANITY AND NO MISFORTUNE AT ALL THAT I SUCCEEDED IN REMOVING THE CRAZIEST MOST IMPOSSIBLE CLAUSES OF THE VERSAILLES TREATY BY PEACEFUL METHODS AND WITHOUT COMPROMISING FOREIGN STATESMEN IN THE INTERNAL POLITICS OF THEIR COUNTRIES THAT SOME DETAILS OF THIS ACTION MAY HAVE BEEN PAINFUL TO CERTAIN INTERESTED PARTIES IS COMPREHENSIBLE BUT THE MERIT IS ALL THE GREATER FOR THE FACT THAT THIS REORGANIZATION WAS BROUGHT ABOUT WITHOUT BLOODSHED IN ALL CASES BUT THE LAST ONE THE LAST REVISION OF THIS TREATY COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT IN EXACTLY THE SAME PEACEFUL WAY HAD NOT TWO CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE MENTIONED HAD THE CONTRARY EFFECT THAT IS CHIEFLY THE FAULT OF THOSE WHO NOT ONLY TOOL NO PLEASURE IN THE FORMER PEACEFUL REVISION BUT ON THE CONTRARY COM PLAINED OF THE FACT THAT BY PEACEFUL METHODS A NEW CENTRAL EUROPE WAS BEING BUILT UP THAT IS TO SAY A CENTRAL EUROPE THAT WAS ABLE ONCE MORE TO GIVE ITS INHABITANTS WORK AND BREAD AS I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED IT WAS ONE OF THE AIMS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REICH TO CLEAR UP THE RELATION BETWEEN OURSELVES AND OUR NEIGHBORS ALLOW ME TO POINT OUT SOME FACTS THAT CANNOT BE REFUTED BY THE SCRIBBLINGS OF INTERNATIONAL PRESS LIARS FIRST GERMANY HAS CONCLUDED NON AGGRESSION PACTS WITH THE BALTIC STATES HER INTERESTS THERE ARE OF AN EXCLUSIVELY ECONOMIC NATURE SECOND IN FORMER TIMES GERMANY NEVER HAD ANY CONFLICT OF INTERESTS OR INDEED LITIGATION POINTS WITH THE NORTHERN STATES AND SHE HAS NONE TODAY EITHER THIRD GERMANY HAS TAKEN NO STEPS IN REGARD TO THE GERMAN TERRITORY HANDED OVER TO DENMARK UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES SHE HAS ON THE CONTRARY ESTABLISHED LOCAL AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH DENMARK WE HAVE CLAIMED NO REVISION BUT WE HAVE CONCLUDED A NON AGGRESSION PACT WITH DENMARK OUR RELATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY ARE THUS DIRECTED TOWARD UNSWERVINGLY LOYAL AND FRIENDLY CO OPERATION FOURTH HOLLAND THE NEW REICH HAS ENDEAVORED TO CONTINUE THE TRADITIONAL FRIENDSHIP WITH HOLLAND IT DID NOT TAKE OVER ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO STATES NOR DID IT CREATE NEW ONES FIFTH BELGIUM IMMEDIATELY AFTER I HAD TAKEN OVER THE GOVERNMENT I TRIED TO ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH BELGIUM 1 RENOUNCED ANY REVISION AS WELL AS ANY DESIRE FOR REVISION THE REICH HAS PUT FORWARD NO CLAIM WHICH MIGHT IN ANY WAY HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS A THREAT TO BELGIUM SIXTH SWITZERLAND GERMANY ADOPTED THE SAME ATTITUDE TOWARD SWITZERLAND THE REICH GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER GIVEN THE SLIGHTEST CAUSE FOR DOUBT REGARDING THEIR DESIRES TO ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTRY MOREOVER THEY THEMSELVES HAVE NEVER BROUGHT FORWARD ANY COMPLAINT REGARDING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES SEVENTH IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ANSCHLUSS WITH AUSTRIA BECAME AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT I INFORMED YUGOSLAVIA THAT THE FRONTIER IN COMMON WITH THAT COUNTRY WOULD HENCEFORTH BE REGARDED AS UNALTERABLE BY GERMANY AND THAT WE WISHED ONLY TO LIVE IN PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP WITH THAT COUNTRY EIGHTH THE BOND WHICH BINDS US TO HUNGARY IS OLD AND TRADITIONAL ONE OF

NOW BEEN REALIZED NOW WITH THAT STATE LASTING AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THE EFFECT OF WHICH WILL BE A BLESSING TO BOTH NATIONS THUS THE REVISION OF THE VERSAILLES TREATY CARRIED THROUGH BY ME DID NOT CAUSE ANY CHAOS IN EUROPE BUT ON THE CONTRARY PRODUCED THE PREREQUISITE OF CLEAR STABLE AND BEARABLE CONDITIONS ONLY THOSE WHO DETEST THIS ORDER OF THINGS IN EUROPE AND WISH FOR DISORDER CAN FEEL HOSTILE TO THESE ACTIONS IF HOWEVER CERTAIN PEOPLE THINK THEMSELVES OBLIGED TO REJECT WITH A HYPOCRITICAL AIR THE METHOD BY WHICH A TOLERABLE ORDER OF THINGS WAS ESTABLISHED IN CENTRAL EUROPE THEN MY ONLY REPLY TO THEM IS THAT IN THE END IT IS NOT SO MUCH THE METHOD BUT THE USEFUL RESULT THAT COUNTS BEFORE I CAME INTO POWER CENTRAL EUROPE THAT IS TO SAY NOT ONLY GERMANY BUT ALSO THE SURROUNDING STATES WAS SINKING INTO THE HOPELESS DISTRESS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTION HAD DECREASED INVOLVING AN AUTOMATIC JUMP IN COMMODITY CONSUMPTION THE STANDARD OF LIVING WENT DOWN DISTRESS AND MISERY WERE THE RESULT NO CRITICIZING FOREIGN STATESMAN CAN DENY THAT NOT ONLY IN THE OLD REICH BUT ALSO IN ALL THE TERRITORY NOW MERGED WITH IT IT HAS BECOME POSSIBLE TO REMOVE THESE INDICATIONS OF DECAY IN THE FACE OF THE MOST ADVERSE CONDITIONS IT HAS THUS BEEN PROVED THAT ONLY AS AN ENTITY IS THIS CENTRAL EUROPEAN SPACE CAPABLE OF EXISTENCE AND THAT WHOEVER BREAKS UP THAT ENTITY COMMITS A CRIME AGAINST MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO HAVE WIPED OUT THAT CRIME DOES NOT AMOUNT TO A BREACH OF MY WORD BUT TO ME IS HONOR ITSELF I AM PROUD OF IT AS MY DEED BEFORE HISTORY NEITHER THE GERMAN PEOPLE NOR MYSELF HAS TAKEN AN OATH ON THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES I HAVE MERELY TAKEN AN OATH ON THE WELFARE OF MY PEOPLE WHO GAVE ME MY MANDATE AND ON THE WELFARE OF THOSE WHOM DESTINY HAS PLACED WITHIN OUR LIVING SPACE THUS INSEPARABLY BINDING THEM TO OUR OWN WELFARE TO GUARANTEE THE EXISTENCE AND THUS THE LIFE OF ALL OF THEM IS MY SOLE CONCERN ANY ATTEMPT TO CRITICIZE JUDGE OR REJECT MY ACTIONS FROM THE ROSTRUM OF INTERNATIONAL PRESUMPTION HAS NO FOUNDATION BEFORE HISTORY AND PERSONALLY LEAVES ME STONE COLD I WAS CALLED TO MY POST BY THE CONFIDENCE VESTED IN ME BY THE GERMAN PEOPLE WHOSE ATTITUDE TOWARD ME IS ONLY STRENGTHENED BY ANY SUCH ATTEMPT AT CRITICISM OR INTERFERENCE FROM ABROAD MOREOVER PREVIOUS TO EACH SINGLE REVISION I HAVE PUT FORWARD PROPOSALS I HAD ATTEMPTED BY MEANS OF NEGOTIATIONS TO ACHIEVE AND SECURE WHAT WAS ABSOLUTELY INDISPENSABLE IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CASES I WAS SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER CASES I AM SORRY TO SAY MY READINESS TO NEGOTIATE AND PERHAPS ALSO THE SMALL EXTENT OF MY DEMANDS AND THE MODESTY OF MY PROPOSALS WERE INTERPRETED AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS AND THEREFORE REJECTED NOBODY COULD HAVE REGRETTED THIS MORE THAN I DID THERE ARE HOWEVER IN THE LIFE OF NATIONS CERTAIN NECESSITIES WHICH IF THEY ARE NOT BROUGHT ABOUT BY PEACEFUL METHODS MUST BE REALIZED BY FORCE HOWEVER REGRETTABLE THIS APPEARS NOT ONLY TO THE LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN BUT ALSO TO THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT THE GREATER INTERESTS COMMON TO ALL MUST NEVER BE IMPAIRED BY THE STUBBORNNESS OR ILL WILL OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES TO POLAND TOO I MADE THE MOST MODERATE PROPOSALS THEY WERE NOT ONLY REJECTED BUT ON THE CONTRARY BROUGHT FORTH THE GENERAL MOBILIZATION OF THAT STATE FOR WHICH REASONS WERE ADVANCED WHICH PROVED CONCLUSIVELY EXACTLY THAT IT WAS THE VERY MODESTY OF MY PROPOSALS WHICH WAS CONSIDERED A CONFIRMATION OF MY WEAKNESS NAY EVEN OF MY FEAR REALLY SUCH AN EXPERIENCE IS APT TO MAKE ANYONE SHRINK FROM EVER AGAIN MAKING ANY REASONABLE AND MODERATE PROPOSALS ALSO AT PRESENT I ONCE MORE READ IN CERTAIN NEWSPAPERS THAT EVERY ATTEMPT TO BRING ABOUT A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF RELATIONS BETWEEN GERMANY ON THE ONE HAND AND FRANCE AND ENGLAND ON THE OTHER WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE AND THAT ANY PROPOSAL IN THAT DIRECTION ONLY PROVED THAT I FILLED WITH APPREHENSION ANTICIPATED GERMANY'S COLLAPSE AND THAT I ONLY MADE SUCH A PROPOSAL OUT OF COWARDICE OR FROM A BAD CONSCIENCE WHEN IRRESPECTIVE OF ALL THIS I HAVE EXPRESSED MY IDEAS ON THIS PROBLEM I AM PREPARED TO APPEAR IN THE EYES OF THESE PEOPLE AS A COWARD OR A FINISHED MAN I CAN AFFORD TO RUN THAT RISK BECAUSE THE JUDGMENT TO BE PASSED UPON ME BY HISTORY WILL NOT THANK GOD BE WRITTEN BY THESE MISERABLE SCRIBBLERS BUT IS ESTABLISHED BY MY LIFE'S WORK AND BECAUSE I DO NOT CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT ANY JUDGMENT THAT MAY BE PASSED UPON ME BY THESE PEOPLE AT THE TIME MY PRESTIGE IS SUFFICIENT FOR ME TO ALLOW MYSELF SUCH AN ATTITUDE BECAUSE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER MY FOLLOWING THOUGHTS ARE ACTUALLY DICTATED BY FEAR OR DESPERATION WILL IN ANY CASE BE SETTLED BY THE FUTURE COURSE OF EVENTS TODAY I CAN ONLY REGRET THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHOSE BLOODTHIRSTINESS CANNOT HAVE ENOUGH OF WAR UNFORTUNATELY ARE NOT WHERE THE WAR IS ACTUALLY BEING FOUGHT AND NEVER WERE AT SUCH PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WERE SHOOTING IT OUT I CAN VERY WELL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE INTERESTED PARTIES WHO PROFIT MORE FROM WAR THAN FROM PEACE AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT FOR A CERTAIN VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL JOURNALIST IT IS MORE INTERESTING TO REPORT ON WAR THAN ON PEACEFUL ACTIVITIES OR CULTURAL ACHIEVEMENTS WHICH THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF EITHER JUDGING OR UNDERSTANDING AND FINALLY IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN JEWISH INTERNATIONAL CAPITALISM AND JOURNALISM THAT HAS NO FEELING AT ALL IN COMMON WITH THE PEOPLE WHOSE INTERESTS THEY PRETEND TO REPRESENT
BUT WHO LIKE HEROSTRATES OF OLD REGARD INCENDIARISM AS THE GREATEST SUCCESS OF THEIR LIVES BUT THERE IS STILL ANOTHER REASON WHY I FEEL OBLIGED TO VOICE MY OPINION WHEN READING CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL PRESS PUBLICATIONS OR LISTENING TO SPEECHES OF VARIOUS CAPITALIST GLORIFIERS OF WAR I CONSIDER MYSELF ENTITLED TO SPEAK AND REPLY IN THE NAME OF THOSE WHO ARE FORCED TO SERVE AS THE LIVING SUBSTANCE FOR THE MENTAL ACTIVITIES OF THESE FORMULATORS OF WAR AIMS THAT LIVING SUBSTANCE TO WHICH I MYSELF BELONGED AS AN UNKNOWN SOLDIER FOR MORE THAN FOUR YEARS DURING THE GREAT WAR IT IS PERHAPS A MAGNIFICENT EFFECT WHEN A STATESMAN OR A JOURNALIST STANDS UP AND IN ENTHUSIASTIC WORDS ANNOUNCES THE NECESSITY OF REMOVING THE REGIME OF ANOTHER COUNTRY IN THE NAME OF DEMOCRACY OR SOMETHING SIMILAR PRACTICAL EXECUTION OF THESE GLORIOUS SLOGANS HOWEVER HAS QUITE A DIFFERENT ASPECT NEWSPAPER ARTICLES ARE BEING WRITTEN TODAY WHICH ARE SURE OF AN ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION BY THE DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC REALIZATION OF DEMANDS THEREIN CONTAINED HOWEVER IS APT TO AROUSE MUCH LESS ENTHUSIASM I SHALL NOT DEAL WITH THE POWERS OF JUDGMENT OR THE GIFTS OF SUCH PEOPLE WHATEVER THEY MAY WRITE HAS NO BEARING ON THE REAL NATURE OF SUCH A STRUGGLE THESE SCRIBBLERS ANNOUNCED BEFORE THE POLISH CAMPAIGN THAT GERMAN INFANTRY PERHAPS WAS NOT BAD BUT THAT TANK AND MECHANIZED UNITS IN GENERAL WERE INFERIOR AND WOULD BE SURE TO BREAK DOWN IN ACTION NOW AFTER THE DEFEAT OF POLAND THE SAME PEOPLE BRAZENLY ASSERT THAT THE POLISH ARMIES HAVE COLLAPSED ONLY BECAUSE O GERMAN TANK FORMATIONS AND OTHER MECHANIZED TROOPS BUT THAT ON THE OTHER HAND GERMAN INFANTRY HAD DETERIORATED MOST REMARKABLY AND HAD GOT THE WORST OF IT IN EVERY CLASH WITH THE POLISH 'IN THIS FACT SO ONE SUCH WRITER ACTUALLY SAYS 'ONE HAS THE FREE RIGHT TO SEE A FAVORABLE SYMPTOM FOR THE COURSE OF THE WAR IN THE WEST AND THE FRENCH SOLDIER WILL KNOW HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS 'I THINK SO TOO PROVIDED HE HAS READ THAT ARTICLE AND CAN REMEMBER IT LATER ON HE WILL THEN PROBABLY BOX THE EARS OF THESE MILITARY SOOTHSAYERS BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE SINCE THESE PEOPLE NEVER WILL PUT THEIR THEORIES ON INFERIORITY OF THE GERMAN INFANTRY TO A PERSONAL TEST ON THE BATTLEFIELDS BUT WILL MERELY DESCRIBE THESE QUALITIES FROM THEIR EDITORIAL SANCTUMS SIX WEEKS LET US SAY FOURTEEN DAYS OF CONCENTRATED SHELLFIRE AND THESE WAR PROPAGANDISTS WOULD SOON THINK DIFFERENTLY THEY ALWAYS ARE TALKING OF THE NECESSITIES OF WORLD POLITICS BUT THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF MILITARY REALITIES I DO KNOW THEM AND FOR THAT REASON I CONSIDER IT MY DUTY TO SPEAK HERE EVEN AT RISK OF THE WARMONGER AGAIN SEEING IN MY SPEECH EVIDENCE OF MY ANXIETY AND SYMPTOMS OF THE DEGREE OF MY DESPAIR WHY SHOULD THIS WAR IN THE WEST BE FOUGHT FOR RESTORATION OF POLAND POLAND OF THE VERSAILLES TREATY WILL NEVER RISE AGAIN THIS IS GUARANTEED BY TWO OF THE LARGEST STATES IN THE WORLD FINAL RE ORGANIZATION OF THIS TERRITORY AND THE QUESTION OF RE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE POLISH STATE ARE PROBLEMS WHICH WILL NOT BE SOLVED BY A WAR IN THE WEST BUT EXCLUSIVELY BY RUSSIA ON THE ONE HAND AND GERMANY ON THE OTHER FURTHERMORE THE ELIMINATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THESE TWO POWERS WITHIN THE TERRITORIES CONCERNED WOULD NOT PRODUCE A NEW STATE BUT UTTER CHAOS THE PROBLEMS AWAITING SOLUTION THERE WILL NEVER BE SOLVED EITHER AT THE CONFERENCE TABLE OR IN EDITORIAL OFFICES BUT BY THE WORK OF DECADES IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT A FEW STATESMEN WHO ARE NOT REALLY CONCERNED WITH THE FATE OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED GET TOGETHER AND PASS RESOLUTIONS IT IS NECESSARY THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS HIMSELF A SHARE IN THE LIFE OF THESE TERRITORIES TAKES OVER THE TASK OF RESTORING REALLY ENDURING CONDITIONS THERE THE ABILITY OF THE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES TO RESTORE SUCH ORDERED CONDITIONS HAS AT LEAST IN RECENT TIMES NOT BEEN PROVED THE EXAMPLE OF PALESTINE SHOWS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO CONCENTRATE ON THE TASKS AT HAND AND SOLVE THESE IN A REASONABLE MANNER INSTEAD OF MEDDLING WITH PROBLEMS WHICH LIE WITHIN THE VITAL SPHERES OF INTEREST OF OTHER NATIONS AND COULD CERTAINLY BE BETTER SOLVED BY THEM AT ANY RATE GERMANY HAS IN HER PROTECTORATE OF BOHEMIA AND MORAVIA NOT ONLY ESTABLISHED PEACE AND ORDER BUT ABOVE ALL HAS LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND INCREASING UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS ENGLAND STILL HAS MUCH TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE SHE CAN POINT TO SIMILAR RESULTS IN HER PROTECTORATE IN PALESTINE ONE ALSO REALIZES THAT IT WOULD BE SENSELESS TO ANNIHILATE MILLIONS OF MEN AND TO DESTROY PROPERTY WORTH MILLIONS IN ORDER TO RECONSTRUCT A STATE WHICH AT ITS VERY BIRTH WAS TERMED AN ABORTION BY ALL THOSE NOT OF POLISH EXTRACTION WHAT OTHER REASON EXISTS HAS GERMANY MADE ANY DEMANDS OF ENGLAND WHICH MIGHT THREATEN THE BRITISH EMPIRE OR ENDANGER ITS EXISTENCE ON THE CONTRARY GERMANY HAS MADE NO SUCH DEMANDS ON EITHER FRANCE OR ENGLAND BUT IF THIS WAR IS REALLY TO BE WAGED ONLY IN ORDER TO GIVE GERMANY A NEW REGIME THAT IS TO SAY IN ORDER TO DESTROY THE PRESENT REICH ONCE MORE AND THUS TO CREATE A NEW TREATY OF VERSAILLES THEN MILLIONS OF HUMAN LIVES WILL BE SACRIFICED IN VAIN FOR NEITHER WILL THE GERMAN REICH GO TO PIECES NOR WILL A SECOND TREATY OF VERSAILLES BE MADE AND EVEN SHOULD THIS COME TO
PASS AFTER THREE FOUR OR EVEN EIGHT YEARS OF WAR THEN THIS SECOND VERSAILLES WOULD ONCE MORE BECOME THE SOURCE OF FRESH CONFLICT IN THE FUTURE IN ANY EVENT A SETTLEMENT OF THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS CARRIED OUT WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF THE VITAL INTERESTS OF ITS MOST POWERFUL NATIONS COULD NOT POSSIBLY AFTER THE LAPSE OF FROM FIVE TO TEN YEARS END IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN THAT ATTEMPT MADE TWENTY YEARS AGO WHICH IS NOW ENDED NO THIS WAR IN THE WEST CANNOT SETTLE ANY PROBLEMS EXCEPT PERHAPS THE RUINED FINANCES OF CERTAIN ARMAMENT MANUFACTURERS NEWSPAPER OWNERS OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL WAR PROFITEERS TWO PROBLEMS ARE RIPE FOR DISCUSSION TODAY FIRST THE SETTLEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE DISINTEGRATION OF POLAND AND SECOND THE PROBLEM OF ELIMINATING THOSE INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ENDANGER THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC EXISTENCE OF THE NATIONS WHAT THEN ARE THE AIMS OF THE REICH GOVERNMENT AS REGARDS THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONDITIONS WITHIN THE TERRITORY TO THE WEST OF THE GERMAN SOVIET LINE OF DEMARCATION WHICH HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS GERMANY'S SPHERE OF INFLUENCE FIRST THE CREATION OF A REICH FRONTIER WHICH AS HAS ALREADY BEEN EMPHASIZED SHALL BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING HISTORICAL ETHNOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SECOND THE DISPOSITION OF THE ENTIRE LIVING SPACE ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES THAT IS TO SAY THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE MINORITIES WHICH CONCERN NOT ONLY THIS AREA BUT NEARLY ALL THE STATES IN THE SOUTHWEST OF EUROPE THIRD IN THIS CONNECTION AN ATTEMPT TO REACH A SOLUTION AND SETTLEMENT OF THE JEWISH PROBLEM FOURTH RECONSTRUCTION OF TRANSPORT FACILITIES AND ECONOMIC LIFE IN THE INTEREST OF ALL THOSE LIVING IN THIS AREA FIFTH A GUARANTEE FOR THE SECURITY OF THIS ENTIRE TERRITORY AND SIXTH FORMATION OF A POLISH STATE SO CONSTITUTED AND GOVERNED AS TO PREVENT ITS BECOMING ONCE AGAIN EITHER A HOTBED OF ANTI GERMAN ACTIVITY OR A CENTER OF INTRIGUE AGAINST GERMANY AND RUSSIA IN ADDITION TO THIS AN ATTEMPT MUST IMMEDIATELY BE MADE TO WIPE OUT OR AT LEAST TO MITIGATE THE ILL EFFECTS OF WAR THAT IS TO SAY THE ADOPTION OF PRACTICAL MEASURES FOR ALLEVIATION OF THE TERRIBLE DISTRESS PREVAILING THERE THESE PROBLEMS CAN AS I HAVE ALREADY EMPHASIZED PERHAPS BE DISCUSSED BUT NEVER SOLVED AT THE CONFERENCE TABLE IF EUROPE IS REALLY SINCERE IN HER DESIRE FOR PEACE THEN THE STATES IN EUROPE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT RUSSIA AND GERMANY ARE PREPARED TO TRANSFORM THIS HOTBED INTO A ZONE OF PEACEFUL DEVELOPMENT AND THAT THESE TWO COUNTRIES WILL ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY AND BEAR THE BURDENS INEVITABLY INVOLVED FOR THE REICH THIS PROJECT SINCE IT CANNOT BE UNDERTAKEN IN AN IMPERIALISTIC SPIRIT IS A TASK WHICH WILL TAKE FIFTY TO A HUNDRED YEARS TO PERFORM JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS ACTIVITY ON GERMANY'S PART LIES IN THE POLITICAL ORGANIZING OF THIS TERRITORY AS WELL AS IN ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE LONG RUN OF COURSE ALL EUROPE WILL BENEFIT FROM IT SECOND AND IN MY OPINION BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IS THE CREATION OF NOT ONLY A BELIEF IN BUT ALSO A SENSE OF EUROPEAN SECURITY FOR THIS IT IS NECESSARY FIRST THAT AIMS IN THE FOREIGN POLICY OF EUROPEAN STATES SHOULD BE MADE PERFECTLY CLEAR AS FAR AS GERMANY IS CONCERNED THE REICH GOVERNMENT IS READY TO GIVE A THOROUGH AND EXHAUSTIVE EXPOSITION OF THE AIMS OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY IN SO DOING THEY BEGIN BY STATING THAT THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES IS NOW REGARDED BY THEM AS OBSOLETE IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE GERMAN REICH AND WITH THEM THE WHOLE GERMAN PEOPLE NO LONGER SEE CAUSE OR REASON FOR ANY FURTHER REVISION OF THE TREATY APART FROM THE DEMAND FOR ADEQUATE COLONIAL POSSESSIONS JUSTLY DUE TO THE REICH NAMELY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE FOR THE RETURN OF GERMAN COLONIES THIS DEMAND FOR COLONIES IS BASED NOT ONLY ON GERMANY'S HISTORICAL CLAIM TO GERMAN COLONIES BUT ABOVE ALL ON HER ELEMENTARY RIGHT TO A SHARE OF THE WORLD'S RESOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS THIS DEMAND DOES NOT TAKE THE FORM OF AN ULTIMATUM NOR IS IT A DEMAND BACKED BY FORCE BUT A DEMAND BASED ON POLITICAL JUSTICE AND SANE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES SECONDLY THE DEMAND FOR A REAL REVIVAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LIFE COUPLED WITH AN EXTENSION OF TRADE AND COMMERCE PRESUPPOSES A REORGANIZATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN OTHER WORDS OF PRODUCTION IN THE INDIVIDUAL STATES IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE EXCHANGE OF GOODS THUS PRODUCED HOWEVER MARKETS MUST BE ORGANIZED AND A FINAL CURRENCY REGULATION ARRIVED AT SO THAT THE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF UNRESTRICTED TRADE CAN BE GRADUALLY REMOVED THIRDLY THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITION HOWEVER FOR A REAL REVIVAL OF ECONOMIC LIFE IN AND OUTSIDE OF EUROPE IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED PEACE AND OF A SENSE OF SECURITY ON THE PART OF THE INDIVIDUAL NATIONS THIS SECURITY WILL NOT ONLY BE RENDERED POSSIBLE BY THE FINAL SANCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN STATUS BUT ABOVE ALL BY THE REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS TO A REASONABLE AND ECONOMICALLY TOLERABLE LEVEL AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS NECESSARY SENSE OF SECURITY HOWEVER IS A CLEAR DEFINITION OF THE LEGITIMATE USE OF AN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN MODERN ARMAMENTS WHICH CAN AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT HAVE SUCH A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON THE PULSATING LIFE OF EVERY NATION AND HENCE CREATE A PERMANENT SENSE OF INSECURITY IN MY PREVIOUS SPEECHES IN THE REICHSTAG I MADE PROPOSALS WITH THIS END IN VIEW AT THAT TIME THEY WERE REJECTED MAYBE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY WERE MADE BY ME I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT A SENSE OF NATIONAL SECURITY WILL NOT RETURN TO EUROPE UNTIL CLEAR AND BINDING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS HAVE PROVIDED A COMPREHENSIVE DEFINITION OF THE LEGITIMATE AND ILLEGITIMATE USE OF ARMAMENTS A GENEVA CONVENTION ONCE SUCCEEDED IN PROHIBITING IN CIVILIZED COUNTRIES AT LEAST THE KILLING OF WOUNDED ILL TREATMENT OF PRISONERS WAR AGAINST NONCOMBATANTS ETC AND JUST AS IT WAS POSSIBLE GRADUALLY TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL OBSERVANCE OF THIS STATUTE A WAY MUST SURELY BE FOUND TO REGULATE AERIAL
WARFARE USE OF POISON GAS AND SUBMARINES ETC AND ALSO SO TO DEFINE CONTRABAND THAT WAR WILL LOSE ITS TERRIBLE CHARACTER OF CONFLICT WAGED AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND AGAINST NONCOMBATANTS IN GENERAL A GROWING HORROR OF CERTAIN METHODS OF WARFARE WILL OF ITS OWN ACCORD LEAD TO THEIR ABOLITION AND THUS THEY WILL BECOME OBSOLETE IN THE WAR WITH POLAND I ENDEAVORED TO RESTRICT AERIAL WARFARE TO OBJECTIVES OF SO CALLED MILITARY IMPORTANCE OR ONLY TO EMPLOY IT TO COMBAT ACTIVE RESISTANCE AT A GIVEN POINT BUT IT MUST SURELY BE POSSIBLE TO EMULATE THE RED CROSS AND TO DRAW UP SOME UNIVERSALLY VALID INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS IT IS ONLY WHEN THIS IS ACHIEVED THAT PEACE CAN REIGN PARTICULARLY IN OUR DENSELY POPULATED CONTINENT A PEACE WHICH UNCONTAMINATED BY SUSPICION AND FEAR WILL PROVIDE THE ONLY POSSIBLE CONDITION FOR REAL ECONOMIC PROSPERITY I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY RESPONSIBLE STATESMAN IN EUROPE WHO DOES NOT IN HIS HEART DESIRE PROSPERITY FOR HIS PEOPLE BUT SUCH A DESIRE CAN ONLY BE REALIZED IF ALL THE NATIONS INHABITING THIS CONTINENT DECIDE TO GO TO WORK TOGETHER TO ASSIST IN ASSURING THIS CO OPERATION MUST BE THE AIM OF EVERY MAN WHO IS SINCERELY STRUGGLING FOR THE FUTURE OF HIS OWN PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE THIS GREAT END THE LEADING NATIONS OF THIS CONTINENT WILL ONE DAY HAVE TO COME TOGETHER IN ORDER TO DRAW UP ACCEPT AND GUARANTEE A STATUTE ON A COMPREHENSIVE BASIS WHICH WILL INSURE FOR THEM ALL A SENSE OF SECURITY OF CALM IN SHORT OF PEACE SUCH A CONFERENCE COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE HELD WITHOUT THE MOST THOROUGH PREPARATION THIS IS WITHOUT EXACT ELUCIDATION OF EVERY POINT AT ISSUE IT IS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT SUCH A CONFERENCE WHICH IS TO DETERMINE THE FATE OF THIS CONTINENT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME COULD CARRY ON ITS DELIBERATIONS WHILE CANNON ARE THUNDERING OR MOBILIZED ARMIES ARE BRINGING PRESSURE TO BEAR UPON IT IF HOWEVER THESE PROBLEMS MUST BE SOLVED SOONER OR LATER THEN IT WOULD BE MORE SENSIBLE TO TACKLE THE SOLUTION BEFORE MILLIONS OF MEN ARE FIRST USELESSLY SENT TO DEATH AND MILLIARDS OF RICHES DESTROYED CONTINUATION OF THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE WEST IS UNTHINKABLE EACH DAY WILL SOON DEMAND INCREASING SACRIFICES PERHAPS THE DAY WILL COME WHEN FRANCE WILL BEGIN TO BOMBARD AND DEMOLISH SAARBRUCCKEN GERMAN ARTILLERY WILL IN TURN LAY MULHOUSE IN RUINS FRANCE WILL RETALIATE BY BOMBARDING KARLSRUHE AND GERMANY IN HER TURN WILL SHELL STRASBOURG THEN THE FRENCH ARTILLERY WILL FIRE AT FREIBURG AND THE GERMAN AT KOLMAR OR SCHLETTSTADT LONG RANGE GUNS WILL THEN BE SET UP AND FROM BOTH SIDES WILL STRIKE DEEPER AND DEEPER AND WHATEVER CANNOT BE REACHED BY THE LONG DISTANCE GUNS WILL BE DESTROYED FROM THE AIR AND THAT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING FOR CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS AND VERY PROFITABLE FOR THE AIRPLANE ARMS AND MUNITIONS MANUFACTURERS BUT APPALLING FOR THE VICTIMS AND THIS BATTLE OF DESTRUCTION WILL NOT BE CONFINED TO THE LAND NO IT WILL REACH FAR OUT OVER THE SEA TODAY THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY ISLANDS AND THE NATIONAL WEALTH OF EUROPE WILL BE SCATTERED IN THE FORM OF SHELLS AND THE VIGOR OF EVERY NATION WILL BE SAPPED ON THE BATTLEFIELDS ONE DAY HOWEVER THERE WILL AGAIN BE A FRONTIER BETWEEN GERMANY AND FRANCE BUT INSTEAD OF FLOURISHING TOWNS THERE WILL BE RUINS AND ENDLESS GRAVEYARDS MR CHURCHILL AND HIS COMPANIONS MAY INTERPRET THESE OPINIONS OF MINE AS WEAKNESS OR COWARDICE IF THEY LIKE I NEED NOT OCCUPY MYSELF WITH WHAT THEY THINK I MAKE THESE STATEMENTS SIMPLY BECAUSE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT I WISH TO SPARE MY OWN PEOPLE THIS SUFFERING IF HOWEVER THE OPINIONS OF MESSRS CHURCHILL AND FOLLOWERS SHOULD PREVAIL THIS STATEMENT WILL HAVE BEEN MY LAST THEN WE SHALL FIGHT NEITHER FORCE OF ARMS NOR LAPSE OF TIME WILL CONQUER GERMANY THERE NEVER WILL BE ANOTHER NOVEMBER 1918 IN GERMAN HISTORY IT IS INFANTILE TO HOPE FOR THE DISINTEGRATION OF OUR PEOPLE MR CHURCHILL MAY BE CONVINCED THAT GREAT BRITAIN WILL WIN I DO NOT DOUBT FOR A SINGLE MOMENT THAT GERMANY WILL BE VICTORIOUS DESTINY WILL DECIDE WHO IS RIGHT ONE THING ONLY IS CERTAIN IN THE COURSE OF WORLD HISTORY THERE HAVE NEVER BEEN TWO VICTORS BUT VERY OFTEN ONLY LOSERS THIS SEEMS TO ME TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE
