IN THE END LYRICS
VERSE 1 MIKE SHINODA
IT STARTS WITH ONE THING I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY
KEEP THAT IN MIND I DESIGNED THIS RHYME TO EXPLAIN IN DUE TIME
ALL I KNOW
TIME IS A VALUABLE THING
WATCH IT FLY BY AS THE PENDULUM SWINGS
WATCH IT COUNT DOWN TO THE END OF THE DAY
THE CLOCK TICKS LIFE AWAY
IT'S SO UNREAL
DIDN'T LOOK OUT BELOW WATCHED THE TIME GO RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW
TRYING TO HOLD ON DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I WASTED IT ALL JUST TO WATCH YOU GO
I KEPT EVERYTHING INSIDE
AND EVEN THOUGH I TRIED IT ALL FELL APART
WHAT IT MEANT TO ME WILL EVENTUALLY BE A MEMORY OF A TIME WHEN I

ONE THING I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY
KEEP THAT IN MIND I DESIGNED THIS RHYME TO REMIND MYSELF HOW

ACTING LIKE I WAS PART OF YOUR PROPERTY
REMEMBERING ALL THE TIMES YOU FOUGHT WITH ME
I'M SURPRISED IT GOT SO FAR
THINGS ARENT THE WAY THEY WERE BEFORE
YOU WOULDNT EVEN RECOGNIZE ME ANYMORE
NOT THAT YOU KNEW ME BACK THEN
BUT IT ALL COMES BACK TO ME IN THE END
I KEPT EVERYTHING INSIDE AND EVEN THOUGH I TRIED IT ALL FELL APART
WHAT IT MEANT TO ME WILL EVENTUALLY BE A
MEMORY OF A TIME WHEN I TRIED SO HARD

VERSE 1 MIKE SHINODA
YEAH HERE WE GO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME
HAND GRENADE PINS IN EVERY LINE
THROW 'EM UP AND LET SOMETHING SHINE
GOING OUT OF MY FUCKING MIND
FILTHY MOUTH NO EXCUSE
FIND A NEW PLACE TO HANG THIS NOOSE
STRING ME UP FROM ATOP THESE ROOFS
KNOT IT TIGHT SO I WON'T GET LOOSE
TRUTH IS YOU CAN STOP AND STARE
RUN MYSELF OUT AND NO ONE CARES
DUG THE TRENCH OUT LAID DOWN THERE
WITH A SHOVEL UP OUT OF REACH SOMEWHERE
YEAH SOMEONE POUR IT IN
MAKE IT A DIRT DANCE FLOOR AGAIN
SAY YOUR PRAYERS AND STOMP IT OUT
WHEN THEY BRING THAT CHORUS IN

DROP YOUR WORDS AND LET SLOPPY FLOW
SHOTGUN OPERA LOCK AND LOAD
COCK IT BACK AND THEN WATCH IT GO

DEATH IS ROLLING IN EVERY VERSE
CANDY PAINT ON HIS BRAND NEW HEARSE
CAN'T CONTAIN HIM HE KNOWS HE WORKS
FUCK THIS HURTS I WON'T LIE
DOESN'T MATTER HOW HARD I TRY
HALF THE WORDS DON'T MEAN A THING
AND I KNOW THAT I WON'T BE SATISFIED
SO I TRY IGNORING HIM

WHAT DO I DO TO IGNORE THEM BEHIND ME
DO I FOLLOW MY INSTINCTS BLINDLY
DO I HIDE MY PRIDE FROM THESE BAD DREAMS
AND GIVE IN TO SAD THOUGHTS THAT ARE MADDENING
DO I SIT HERE AND TRY TO STAND IT
OR DO I TRY TO CATCH THEM RED HANDED
DO I TRUST SOME AND GET FOOLED BY PHONINESS
OR DO I TRUST NOBODY AND LIVE IN LONELINESS
BECAUSE I CAN'T HOLD ON WHEN I'M STRETCHED SO THIN
I MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES BUT I'M LOST WITHIN
I PUT ON MY DAILY FACADE BUT THEN

AND TO GO BLINDLY SEEMS SENSELESS
IF I HIDE MY PRIDE AND LET IT ALL GO ON THEN THEYLL
TAKE FROM ME TILL EVERYTHING IS GONE
