All of the Lights Lyrics

[Produced by Kanye West; Co-Produced by Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Choir]
All of the lights, lights, all of the lights

[Hook: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Post-Hook: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flash lights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)

[Hook: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I’ll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flash lights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)

[Hook: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Bridge A: Kid Cudi]
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own

[Bridge B: Fergie, (Rihanna), & Drake]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
(We going all the way this time)
We going all the way this time

[Hook: Choir]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Outro: Alicia Keys & (Elton John)]
Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh)
Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh)
Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh)
Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tell you but all I could say)Ghetto Gospel Lyrics

[Intro]
Uhh, hit em with a little ghetto gospel

[Hook: Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce thinking of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Don't it make you get teary, the world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time and hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined, my ghetto gospel

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad living out of bags
Plus she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's giving birth to a baby
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back will I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you don't stress never forget
That God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy
Cause I chose to puff a blunt
And drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel

[Hook]

[Outro]
Lord can you hear me speak
To pay the price of being Hell boundRocket Man Lyrics

[Verse 1]
She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour 9 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

[Hook] (x2)
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Till touchdown brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man
Rocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone

[Verse 2]
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job 5 days a week
Rocket man! Rocket man!

[Hook]

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time (until fadeout)Can You Feel the Love Tonight Lyrics

[Timon and (Pumbaa)]
I can see what's happening (What?)
And they don't have a clue (Who?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line - our trio's down to two. (Oh.)

[In a sarcastic mock-French accent]
Ze sweet caress of twilight
[Back to normal, but still sarcastic]
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

[Simba:]
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me

[Nala:]
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

[Timon:]
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
[Pumbaa:]
His carefree days with us are history
[Timon and Pumbaa:]
In short, our pal is doomedHakuna Matata Lyrics

[Timon]
Hakuna matata! What a wonderful phrase!

[Pumbaa]
Hakuna matata! Ain't no passing craze!

[Timon]
It means no worries, for the rest of your days...

[Timon, Pumba]
It's our problem-free philosophy...

[Timon]
Hakuna matata!
[Simba]
"Hakuna matata?"

[Pumbaa]
"Yeah. It's our motto!"

[Simba]
"What's a motto?"

[Timon]
"Nothing. What's a-motto with you?"

[Pumbaa]
"You know kid, these two words will solve all your problems."

[Timon]
"That's right. Take Pumbaa for example."
Why, when he was a young warthog...

[Pumbaa]
When I was a young wart hog...

[Timon]
"Very nice."

[Pumbaa]
"Thanks."

[Timon]
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the savannah after every meal

[Pumbaa]
I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And oh, the shame

[Timon]
He was ashamed

[Pumbaa]
Thought of changin' my name!

[Timon]
What's in a name?

[Pumbaa]
And I got downhearted

[Timon]
How did ya feel?

[Pumbaa]
Everytime that I...

[Timon]
Hey! Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!

[Pumbaa]
Oh. Sorry...

[Chorus: Timon, Pumbaa, Simba]
Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata! Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries for the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata!
[Timon, Pumbaa]
"Welcome to our humble home!"

[Simba]
"You live here?"

[Timon]
"We live wherever we want!"

[Pumbaa]
"Yep, home is where your rump rests!"

[Simon]
"It's beautiful."

[Pumbaa]
(burps) "I'm starved!"

[Simba]
"I'm so hungry, I can eat a whole zebra!"

[Timon]
"Uh... we're fresh out of zebra."

[Simba]
"Any antelope?"

[Timon]
Nuh-uh

[Simba]
"Hippo?"

[Timon]
"Nope. Listen, kid, if you live with us, you have to eat like us. Hey, this looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub!"

[Simba]
"Eww... what's that?"

[Timon]
"A grub, what's it look like?"

[Simba]
"Eww, gross!"

[Timon]
"Mm, tastes like chicken!"

[Pumbaa]
(slurps) "Slimy... yet satisfying!"

[Timon]
"These are rare delicacies. Mm. Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch."

[Pumbaa]
(mouth full) "You'll learn to love 'em!"

[Timon]
"I'm telling ya kid, this is the great life. No rules, no responsibilities... ooh, the little cream-filled kind! And best of all, no worries! Well, kid?

[Simba]
Oh well, hakuna matata... (pause) Slimy, yet satisfying!

[Timon]
That's it!
[Chorus: Timon, Pumbaa, Simba]
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna...
It means no worries for the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata!Tiny Dancer Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

[Verse 2]
Jesus Freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

[Verse 3]
Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows the tune she hums

[Bridge]
But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

[Hook]
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
[Repeat 1x]

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

[Hook]Save Rock and Roll Lyrics

[Sample: Patrick Stump]
Until your breathing stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Your-your-your-your, forever

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]
I need more dreams
And less life
And I need that dark
In a little more light
I cried tears you’ll never see
So fuck you, you can go cry me an ocean
And leave me be

[Bridge: Patrick Stump]
You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word yes
I'm here to scream

[Chorus: Patrick Stump] x2
No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll

[Sample]

[Verse 2: Elton John]
Blood brothers in desperation
An oath of silence
For the voice of our generation

[Verse 2: Patrick Stump]
Woah
How’d it get to be only me?
Like I’m the last damn kid still kicking
That still believes

[Bridge 2: Elton & Patrick]
I will defend the faith
Going down swinging
I will save the songs
The songs we can't stop singing

[Chorus: Elton & Patrick] x2

[Bridge 3: Elton & Patrick] x2
Oh no, we won't go
Oh no, we won't go
We don't know when to quit, no, no

[Bridge: Elton]

[Chorus: Elton & Patrick] x2

Abide with me, fast forth the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord abide with me
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, O abide with me
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me
Hold Thou, thy cross, before my closen eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's, morning breaks, and earth's, vain shadows flee
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me
In life, in death, O Lord abide with meAll of the Lights Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummy-doesn't-love-me blues
Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene

[Pre-Chorus]
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen
And hey, hey, hey, you know what i mean

[Chorus]
All the young girls love alice
Tender young alice they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice it's my turn today
All the young girls love alice
Tender young alice they say
If i give you my number
Will you promise to call me
Wait till my husband's away

[Verse 2]
Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last tuesday they found you in the subway dead
And who could you call your friends down in soho
One or two middle-aged dykes in a go-go

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]Bad Side Of The Moon Lyrics

[Verse 1]
It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like a hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue

[Chorus][x2]
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

[Chorus 2][x2]
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life

[Verse 2]
There isn't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
On the bad side of the moon

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Chorus 2][x3]Bennie and the Jets Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 2]
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the JetsBe Prepared Lyrics

[Intro: Scar]
I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my vision and brain

[Scar]
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are...pay attention!
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares!

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer
[Shenzi:] (And where do we feature?)
Just listen to teacher

I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

[Interlude]
[Banzai:] Yeah, be prepared! We'll be prepared! ...for what?
[Scar:] For the death of the king!
[Banzai:] Why? Is he sick?
[Scar:] No, fool, we're going to kill him. And Simba too!
[Shenzi:] Great idea! Who needs a king!
[Hyenas:] No king, no king, la la la la la la!
[Scar:] Idiots! There will be a king!
[Banzai:] Hey, but you said...
[Scar:] I will be king! Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!
[All Hyenas:] Long live the king!

[All Hyenas:] It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

[Scar]
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

[Scar + Hyenas]
So prepare for the coup of the century (Oooh!)
Be prepared for the murkiest scam (Oooh... La! La! La!)
Meticulous planning (We'll have food!)
Tenacity spanning (Lots of food)
Decades of denial (We repeat)
Is simply why I'll (Endless meat)
Be king undisputed (Aaaaaaah...)
Respected, saluted (...aaaaaaah...)
And seen for the wonder I am (...aaaaaaah!)
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared (oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Be prepared!

[All]
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared -
Be prepared!Black Gives Way to Blue Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna feel no more...
It's easier to keep fallin'...
Imitations are pale...
Emptiness all tomorrows, haunted by your ghost...

[Chorus]
Lay down, black gives way to blue...
Lay down, I'll remember you...

[Verse 2]
Fading out by design...
Consciously avoiding changes...
Curtain's drawn, now it's done...
Silencing all tomorrows, forcing a goodbye...

[Chorus]Border Song Lyrics

Holy Moses I have been removed
I have seen the spectre he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses I have been removed

Holy Moses I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses I have been deceived

I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes

Holy Moses I have been deceived
Holy Moses let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease

There's a man over there
What's his color I don't care
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peaceCandle in the Wind Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever didCandle in the Wind 1997 Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

[Verse 2]
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourselves
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

[Chorus]Candle in the Wind (single edit) Lyrics

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever didCan You Feel the Love Tonight Lyrics

[Timon and (Pumbaa)]
I can see what's happening (What?)
And they don't have a clue (Who?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line - our trio's down to two. (Oh.)

[In a sarcastic mock-French accent]
Ze sweet caress of twilight
[Back to normal, but still sarcastic]
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

[Simba:]
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me

[Nala:]
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

[Timon:]
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
[Pumbaa:]
His carefree days with us are history
[Timon and Pumbaa:]
In short, our pal is doomedCan You Feel the Love Tonight Lyrics

[Verse 1]
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 2]
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very bestChloe Lyrics

[Verse 1]
How come you're so understanding
When I tell you all my lies
And pretending to believe them
See through all my alibis
And I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end
Chloe
How you handle what you live through
I can never hope to learn
Taking all the pain I give you
Loving blindly in return
And I need you more than ever
I will always be your friend

[Chorus]
Chloe, Chloe
Chloe, what you going to do about me
Chloe, what you going to do
What you going to do about me

[Verse 2]
You're the lifeline that I cling to
When I feel like giving in
When the dreams that I rely on
Start to wear a little thin
Then I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

[Chorus] [x2]
It's the Circle of Life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the Circle
The Circle of LifeCircle of Life (The Lion King) Lyrics

From the day we arrive on this planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

There is far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

It's the circle of life and it moves us all
Through despair and hope, through faith and love
Till we find our place on the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

It's the circle of life and it moves us all
Through despair and hope, through faith and love
Till we find our place on the path unwinding

[Chorus 1]
I remember when Rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus 2]
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Verse 1]
But the years went by and the Rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 2]Daniel Lyrics

[Chorus 1]
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
And I can see Daniel waving goodbye
Oh it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

[Verse 1]
They say Spain is pretty though I've never been
And Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
He should know, he's been there enough
Oh I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much, oh

[Chorus 2][x2]
Daniel my brother you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky

[Strophe: Rafiki]
Von Geburt an beginnt das Erlebnis
Wenn wir uns zur Sonne drehn
Es gibt mehr zu sehn, als man je sehen kann
Mehr zu tun, soviel mehr zu verstehn
Das Leben hier ist ein Wunder

Alles neu, alles endlos und weit
Und die Sonne zieht leis
Ihren goldenen Kreis
Führt groß und klein
In die Ewigkeit

[Refrain 1: Rafiki]
Und im ewigen Kreis
Dreht sich unser Leben
Dem Gesetz der Natur, sind wir geweiht
Wir sind alle Teil, dieses Universums
Und das Leben, ein ewiger Kreis

Und im ewigen Kreis. Dreht sich unser Leben
