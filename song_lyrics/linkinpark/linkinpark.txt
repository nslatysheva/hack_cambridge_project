In The End Lyrics

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
It starts with one thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
(All I know)
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
(It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below, watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme to remind myself how
(I tried so hard)
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so [far]
Things aren’t the way they were before
You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a
Memory of a time when I (tried so hard)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington] (2X)
I put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There’s only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matterNumb Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

[Hook]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2]
Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Bridge]
And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

[Hook]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Hook]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)Numb/Encore Lyrics

[Intro: Linkin Park & Jay-Z]
Yeah, Thank you thank you thank you, you're far too kind!
Whoo! Aha, uh, whoo, yeah! ready? whoo!
Whoo, Whoo

[Hook: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh uh uh uh
Now what the hell are you waitin foo-oor!!!
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

(Get 'em Jay)

[Verse One]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for THESE GENERATIONS!

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So motherfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

[Verse 3]
Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure, of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertoe, just caught in the undertoe
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertoe, just caught in the undertoe
And every second I waste is more than I can taaaakkee!!

[Hook 2]
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've, become so nuuuuummmbbb!
(Can I get a encore? Do you want more, more, more, more)
I've, become so nuuuummmmbb!
(So for one last time I need y'all to roar!
One last time I need y'all to roar!)Breaking the Habit Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Hook]
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

[Hook]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Tonight

[Verse 2]
Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook - variation]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Tonight

[Bridge]
I'll paint it on the walls
Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

[Hook - Variation]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I’m breaking the habit
TonightCrawling Lyrics

[Hook:]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1:]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Bridge:]
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Mike Shinoda)
Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
(Chester Bennington)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting,reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem...

[Bridge] x2

[Hook]x2Somewhere I Belong Lyrics

(When this began)
I had nothing to say
And I get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused)
And I let it all out to find
That I’m not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me)
But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I’ve got left to feel
(Nothing to lose)
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Hook]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I’ve felt so long
(Erase all the pain till it’s gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I’m close to something real
I wanna find something I’ve wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And I’ve got nothing to say
I can’t believe I didn’t fall right down on my face
(I was confused)
Looking everywhere only to find
That it’s not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I)
What do I have but negativity
’Cause I can’t justify the way, everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose)
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Repeat Hook]

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything till I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Repeat Hook]

I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I’m somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I’m somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belongCastle of Glass Lyrics

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
For you to see1stp Klosr Lyrics

[Intro]

I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

I'm about to break
This room to breathe
This room to breathe
This room to breathe

[Verse 1: Linkin Park]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Just like before

[Hook: Linkin Park](x2)
Everything you say to me
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I'm about to break

[Verse 2: Jonathan Davis]
These are the places where I can feel
Torn from my body, my flesh, it peels
During this ride we can cut up what we like
I'm about to break
Waiting alone, I cannot resist
Feeling this hate, I have never missed
Please, someone, give me a reason to rip off my face
Blood is a-pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring

[Bridge: Linkin Park/Jonathan Davis]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up!
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up!
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up!
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up!
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

[Hook](x2)

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to...Across The Line Lyrics

In this desert
In darkness
Lying with the gun across his chest
Pretending
He's heartless
As the fire flashes in the sky
He was fragile
And frozen
When the bullet took away his friend
And now he's somehow
More broken

He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

Sweating
And shaking
Lying with her hands across her chest
She wakes with
Her cravings
As the fire flashes in her eye
She was fragile
And frozen
When the needle took away her friend
And now she's somehow
More broken

She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

With every battle he's chosing
With every fight he's losing
His enemy's not far behind
With every promise she's broken
With every lie she's spoken
Her enemy's not far behind

It's your time
It's your time
It's your time
It's - your - TIME!

He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

With every battle he's chosing
With every fight he's losing
His enemy's not far behind
With every promise she's broken
With every lie she's spoken
Her enemy's not far behindA Light That Never Comes Lyrics

[Mike Shinoda]
Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me / cannot hold me
You cannot stop much less control me
When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open/ brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take / better take some more
(Oh . .)
‘Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate
(Oh . .)
Night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more
Strong
And I been waiting for it so long

[Hook: Chester Bennington]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

[Mike Shinoda]
When I was young / they told me / they said
“Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign til instead
There comes that day it's off with his head"
(Oh . .)
Night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy, then when you're gone

[Chester Bennington]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
And I told them: Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me / cannot hold me
You cannot stop much less control me
When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open / brace your shores
That pressure don't care / it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take / better take some more

[Chester Bennington]
Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

[Chester Bennington]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comesA Line In The Sand Lyrics

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they
They told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time
But little did we know

[Verse 1: Mike and Chester]
Today, I looked for a sign
With flames in my hands
A line in the sand
Between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall
But little did you know

[Chorus: Chester]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You’ll get what’s yours and face your crime
You'll tell them give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine

[Verse 2: Mike]
I had never been a coward
I had never seen blood
You had sold me an ocean
And I was lost in the flood
We were counting on a leader
We were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation
And we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper
We were waiting on a wire
So we never saw it coming
When you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation
And you can try to ignore
But when the time comes calling
Yeah, you are gonna get yours

[Chorus]

[Instrumental + Bridge]
And so today, your truth has come
You’re gonna pay for what you’ve, pay for what you've done
You’ll get what’s yours, you’re out of time
And you will give me back what’s mine
Give me back what’s mine
Give me, give me back what's mine (x2)
What's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine
What's mine, what's mine
Give me back what's mine

[Outro: Mike]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they
They told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time
But little did we knowAll For Nothing Lyrics

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
So what'cha waiting for?
Anticipating more
While you debate
What it can take to instigate a war
Yeah, I've been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say
They didn't say before

But you could never see it
Your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe
But this is take a shot time
While you're waiting for a purpose
I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like
"One, two, three, four"

[Chorus: Page Hamilton]
And if I do what you demand
(You say) You’ll let me understand
(You say) You’re gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say) I’ll have no debt to pay
(You say) I’m gonna get what I deserve

[Hook: Chester Bennington]
Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing, all for nothing

[Verse 2: Mike]
Kick back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya'
I really don't know ya'
You talk but let me show ya'
Where to put your paranoia
You’re joking, I don’t have a half a sucker bone to throw ya
I’m disgusted, wonder what could’ve made ya tuck your tail below ya

And no, I'm not your soldier
I'm not taking any orders
I'm a five-star general; infantry controller
Need a lesson? Let me show ya'
Have you checking your composure
While I make you step to it like
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Page]
If I do what you demand
You'll let me understand

[Hook: Chester]

[Mike] "We're too far"
[Brad] "I don't think we're too far"

InstrumentalA Place For My Head Lyrics

[Verse 1 - Mike]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon’s going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors and then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me

[Bridge - Mike]
I’m sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place, to feed your greed -
While I find a place to rest

[Hook - Chester]
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don’t understand
(You’ll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2 - Mike]
Maybe someday I’ll be just like you
And step on people like you do and
Run away the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should’ve known
That you’d wear out your welcome
Now you see how quiet it is, all alone

[Bridge - Mike]
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Instrumental]Big Pimpin'/Papercut Lyrics

[Jay-Z]
*Laughing*
You're wasting your talent Randy!

[Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, ready?

[Hook 1: Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington)]
Why does it look like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

[Hook 1: Mike Shinoda]

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You know I - thug em, fuck em, love em, leave em
Cause I don't fuckin need em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin good
But I don't fuckin feed em
First time they fuss I'm breezin
Talkin bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
Til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts
Then it's, "beep beep" and I'm pickin 'em up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'mma break bread
So you can be livin it up?
Shit I parts with nothin, y'all be frontin
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin, never happen
I'll be forever mackin
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience
And I hate waitin
Ho get yo' ass in
And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check 'em out now
RI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah
And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check 'em out now

We doin - big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s

[Mike Shinoda]

Drop that / get up
Take to the streets / better lock that kid up
Face full of teeth when he hock that spit up
Pacing the beat like a beast
Rocking the block on repeat
Speak from the cut like a rush of blood
Paint red on the sleeves of the ones you love
Lay the sick ones down and the bells will ring
Put pennies on the eyes let the dead men sing

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I shiver and shake the warm air cold
I’m alone on my own
In every mistake I dig this hole
Through my skin and bones

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
It’s harder starting over
Than never to have changed

[Hook: Chester Bennington]
With Blackbirds following me
I’m digging out my grave
They close in, swallowing me
The pain, it comes in waves
I’m getting back what I gave

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I sweat through the sheet as daylight fades
As I waste away
It traps me inside mistakes I’ve made
That’s the price I pay

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
It’s harder starting over
Than never to have changed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
I drop to the floor like I did before
Stop watching / I’m coughing / I can’t be more
What I want and what I need are at constant war
Like a well full of poison / a rotten core
The blood goes thin / the fever stings
And I shake from the hell that the habits bring
Let the sick ones down / the bells will ring
Put pennies on the eyes / let the dead men sing

[Hook]

[Outro x2]
I’m getting back what I gaveBlackout Lyrics

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and never say

[Chorus: Chester]
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

[Verse 2: Chester]
You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and take and take
Fuck it, are you listening?

[Chorus: Chester][×2]

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Floating down as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
And floating up, you pass us in the night
A future gazing out, a past to overwrite
So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let goBleed It Out Lyrics

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Run myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Hook: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, go, stop the show
Drop your words and let sloppy flow
Shotgun, opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So I try ignoring him
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I bleed it out, I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it outBreaking the Habit Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Hook]
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

[Hook]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Tonight

[Verse 2]
Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook - variation]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Tonight

[Bridge]
I'll paint it on the walls
Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

[Hook - Variation]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I’m breaking the habit
TonightBubbles Lyrics

A-one, two, three four

Bubbles, bubbles
I wish my name was bubbles, bubbles
I wish my friends were bubbles, bubbles
I ride my car on bubbles, bubbles
I go real far on bubbles
On bubbles

Bubbles, bubbles
I blow a lot of bubbles, bubbles
I show a lot of bubbles, bubbles
I ride a plane on bubbles, bubbles
I go insane on bubbles
On bubbles

Cause it's a B and a U
And a B and a B and an L
And an E and an S

It's a B and a U
And a B and a B and an L
And an E and an S
And an S

Oh bubbles, oh bubbles
I wish my name was bubbles, bubbles
I wish my friends were bubbles, and bubbles
I drive my car on bubbles, on bubbles
I go real far on bubbles
On bubbles, yeahBurning In The Skies Lyrics

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I used the deadwood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea
And poured it out in an ocean of debris

[Chorus 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

[Verse 2: Mike]
We held our breath when the clouds began to form
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
And in the end we were made to be apart
In separate chambers of the human heart

[Chorus 2: Chester]
I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
It's in the blackened bones
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3: Chester]
I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
The blame is mine alone
For bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve

[Outro: Mike]
I use the dead wood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skiesBurn It Down Lyrics

[1st Verse - Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Hook - Chester Bennington]
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

[2nd Verse - Chester Bennington]
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you go

[Hook - Chester Bennington]

[3rd Verse - Mike Shinoda]
You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played solider, you played king
Struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

[Bridge - Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Hook - Chester Bennington]

[Bridge 2 - Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(So when you fall
I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn)
We can't wait
To burn it to the groundBy Myself Lyrics

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself [myself]

[X2]
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can’t rely on myself

[Hook:]
I can’t hold on
To what I want when I’m stretched so thin
It’s all too much to take in
I can’t hold on
To anything watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back, I’m defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on then they’ll
Take from me ‘till everything is gone
If I let them go I’ll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I’ll be outrun
If I’m killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I’ll be buried in the silence of the answer
By myself [myself]

[X2]
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can’t rely on myself

[Hook]

How do you think I’ve lost so much
I'm so afraid that I'm out of touch
How do you expect... I will know what to do
When all I know Is what you tell me to

[X2]
Don’t you know
I can’t tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can’t seem to convince myself why
I’m stuck on the outside

[Hook x2]Castle of Glass Lyrics

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
For you to seeCastle of Glass (Persian Translation) Lyrics

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
For you to seeChange Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Here I wait, for a good thing to resolve
When I'm sinking in a ship I can't control
And I'm sick, with a smile I try and hide
Broken pieces of a lie, I can't let go

[pre Chorus]
I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown

[Chorus]
Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge, before it began
(And, now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began
I swear, I'm gonna change

[Verse 2]
Here I wait, swimming in a sea of dark
I'm lost in the current of my faults
Here I sink, holding on with all I had
The tide will rise, I'm gonna own what's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown

[Chorus]
Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it began
(And, now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began
I swear, I'm gonna change

[Bridge]
All I wanna do is break free
All I wanna do is break free

[Pre-Chorus]
I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown

[Chorus]
Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it began
(And, now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began
I swear, I'm gonna change

[Outro]
I swear I'm gonna change
(All I want to do is break free)
(All I want to do is break free)
I swear I'm gonna change
