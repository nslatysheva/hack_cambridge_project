Rap God Lyrics

[Produced by DVLP]

[Intro]
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (For six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
(You are just what the doc ordered)

[Verse 1]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
They said I rap like a robot, so call me  rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his, nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap
Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motha-fuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow?
All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (Pew)
MC's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac
N.W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C
And induct them into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay-lookin boy
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, lookin' boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
I'ma work for
Everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keeping up
With the same pace, looking boy

[Verse 3]
Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton No Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere
In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP 1
When I tried to say
"I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal
Coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking
Cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singing to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop"
Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use"
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades, these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic
To the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip abroad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?Lose Yourself Lyrics

[Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over - blaow
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy nope, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

[Hook]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

[Verse 2]
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum dah-dah

[Hook]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, cause man, these God damn
Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option - failure's not
Mom, I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot, feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Hook]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, manKings Never Die Lyrics

[Produced by The New Royales]

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming
But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
Was it, too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that, I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
Cause someone told me that

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to re-tire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say
(It) just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, cause

[Bridge: Eminem]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat ain’t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that "Sound Bombing" Thirstin' Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'mma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never dieThe Hills (Eminem Remix) Lyrics

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Said you want a little company and I love it cause the thrill’s cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he’d wanna kill me
But it’s time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn’t always, will be
Your pill refill and I’ll still be
Your addiction, you can touch a prescription, but don’t fill me
I let you see my dark side, but like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly, we hit the flight deck and got sprung, pew
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills, just the effects of each other
But we gon' film cause I will want your ex to see
(Get it?) that...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2: Eminem]
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I’ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don’t you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you’ll film me
Is with a camera, feel me?
You’re nothing but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep texting me, but at night, if you seek those thrills
What I expect to be?
Cause if you cheat on him just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don’t lecture me, just accept that...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Rabbit]
Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313, put your motherfucking hands up
Look, look

Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf
1, 2, 3, and to the 4
1 Pac, 2 Pac, 3 Pac, 4
4 Pac, 3 Pac, 2 Pac, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfucking MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, fuck the Free World
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dog, you embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look in his fucking yearbook
Fuck Cranbrook

Fuck the beat, I'll go a capella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about meBest Friend Lyrics

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

[Hook: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believing in
But if you spit on my fucking grave
And wish me Hell then I wish you well
I'mma send you straight  up to my best friend

[Hook: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
God, please could you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other  way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the lama
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter
The priesthood, but at least should
Make an attempt to show some remorse
And to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I get attacked
So I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap
Or what I have to say on the mic then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap cause I'm a sinner
And I (I got a best friend, best friend)
Plus balls and intestines
And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever giving it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming
Cause failure's something I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talking 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend)
Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power
Now when I blackout, power outage
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds
The black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
It's word to the diggy doc
Stiggy-stopping is not an option
Something I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)

[Hook: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeahLike Toy Soldiers Lyrics

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with a Benzino
It don't matter I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle
'less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentioning [Suge]
And that was just outta respect, for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down talking the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
I'm still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute, because

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't going to go after him
Until Ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at the Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing?
Well fuck it, that mothafucka could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm copping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit popping
Off at your jaws well then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not going to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause

[Hook]1997 Rap Olympics Lyrics

I'mma tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, specially when you wrote 90% of it
What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'fore you come up missin' like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of shit? bitch be sure that I'm spittin'
Be hittin', you gonna pray to God this shit was written
But it wasn't I'll kill a dozen rappers when I buzzin'
Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now whos ya boy? bitch you about to suffer and see north
When you go in a coma longer than Vladamir Konstastinov
Cut the damn machine off
Get a clean cloth, and wipe this bloody video screen off

_________________________________________________________________

I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
Look at you thinkin I'm about to whip his ass
Cause I'm a do some written shit, plus I get to go last
Well guess what ? even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo verse
I'm bout to slice you like a ginsu
And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
Take you fuckin' shit and cut it off
Yo, you wanna be a dope MC?
Look, don't get mad and start taking your period out on me

_________________________________________________________________

You wanna represent on the microphone but you rap sleazily
I ain't about to battle this fake ass Eazy-E
There ain't no way I'm a do this bullshit
I don't give a fuck, I'm loaded up with a full clip
Time of the month, you couldn't get the tape of the day
Take him away, I ripped him like a paper mache
I've heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
This whole battle was mismatched like your outfit
Try to battle me and get your mouth split
You sold out like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush, I don't give a fuck
Ain't no way that you can fuck with us
I'm givin back with pimp shit
I'll laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the Rap Olympics

_________________________________________________________________

Blah-badee-blah-da-blah-blah, stop babblin'
You so fuckin' wack I'm a walk away while you battlin'
Fuck that, I'm on a brand new solo mission
To make sure that Wendy Day kicks your ass out of the rap coalition
I throw a switch at an execution
With an overdose of devotion don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
So who you sound like on the mic?
There was only one 2Pac, your thug style's just one Big Syke
Take a big hike, bitch you can't catch me
Your best rhymes still ain't shit like a patsy
What the fuck you gonna do?
I'll battle anybody in your crew and I don't give a fuck
I slaughter boys, especially wack ass emcees
That will wear a fake ass corduroy

_________________________________________________________________

I'm bout to make this mic short circuit
This beat is wack as fuck, this shit fits you perfect
I got so many ways to diss you that I'm playful with'ch you
I'll let a razor slit you 'til they have to staple stitch you
And everybody in this fuckin' place'll miss you
If you try to turn my facial tissue to a racial issue
Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
Damn, all you white jokes just backfired
Cause bitch you walkin' up the wrong street
Now go tell all your boys you was beat by a honkey
I don't give a fuck, I'll kill ya, bitch
You better recognize me like a look familiar
Anything you say I'm a kill ya, grill ya
When I fuckin' drill ya I'm Marsh but you're the one that's mellow1999 Lyrics

[Intro]
Hi kids, do you like Kim's bullshit? (No!)
Wanna see me stick her fucking eyeballs right in to my anus?

[Verse 1]
I got a fucking time traveling machine to go back all to this
And see all the piss that she gave me, bitch
She made me fall on my ass
The walls are caving in and I gotta go ham on this bitch
Like, woah, so we never fell in love so I didn't have to
Go through that shit no more
It's like a nugget, I'm hugging these sluts
That are bothering this fucking chick when I murder
And spit on the beat like the drugs I was taking
Just a bit of it
And stop slurping the blood off her face, or I'll murder you too with a bag full of mace and if Kim comes to my house and says "Wanna get back together?"
And I say "No, get out before I [slit your throat] and splatter the blood on this sweater!"
Blue eyes, red eyes, green eyes, bloody eyes
Hi Mom, you're back again, rock climbing my dick to see how famous my fucking life is?

[Hook x2]
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rosie, pocket full of posie
Kim, Kim, be shady like me, I'm trying for the 4th
Stop being a bitch, please, walking across the highway
Playing Chicken, while brains splatter all over the road like
"ricken, ricken", my phone's dead, now how can I call the bitch?
I'll use the payphone, this bitch is calling my dead phone, she won't leave me alone
Spent 75 cents on her, and she didn't answer
Now I'll come to her house and [slaughter her ancesters]
Boo! I'm a ghost, you happy to see me? I'm taking your soul
Well shit, you don't believe me? Boom, I did it, do you believe me now? Shit whatever, I'm the king so hand me the crown

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, I said 1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, no other faggot can control my life2012 Something From Nothing: Art of Rap Freestyle Lyrics

How the fuck he got an Oscar
Passed out in his red Mazda
With his fucking head in his pasta
In the parking lot of K-Mart plaza
Across from the Red Lobster
Looking like the Loch Ness Monster
Dressed like a cross-dressed mobster
Talk is cheap, it costs less to gossip
I'll probably be a lot less hostile
If you snots kept your schnozzes out the air holes
You'll get fucked in all seven holes
Ass, mouth, pussy yeah, both ears and ha yes nostrils
At the OzzFest with Nas
Bumping Das EFX in a wrecked up Datsun
And dropped two extra strength Watson Vicodin out my pocket
They cost less
I'm a hot mess
Cause I tripped and got my head stuck
In a wasps nest in the process, awesome
Drunk as fuck, one sock
Pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves
But I keep dropping my fucking binoculars
Got two fucking Hydroxycuts
And four oxi’s stuck in my esophogus
These three lesbian little stocky sluts
Thought I swallowed two hockey pucks
Started screaming "serves you right you cocky fuck
That's what you get for mocking us
Ain't as cool as you thought you was"
Bitch all I did when I walked up was have my dick in a sock
Said it was a sock puppet
So no strings attached
You can all suck it
Chicka get it, ah fuck it
Shit’s bout to get as hairy as motherfucking Chewbaca's nuts
Cocksuckas2.0 Boys Lyrics

[Royce da 5'9"]
Ryan's a homicidal misfit, I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violent psychotic wit
Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your ass
Before I write your shit, pause, inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water, then go and drown a fish
Fuck, I'm fucking heinous, I make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you saying?

[Eminem]
FUCK! It's fucking raining, SHIT! There's lightning, BITCH!
It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, SHIT!
SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, chump
If you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say
That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fucking the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre
Shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing, fuck a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye

[Hook: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind, you think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up, this game is over

[Joell Ortiz]
Puffin' loosies, watching "I Love Lucy" with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
'Til then I kill the bad man trying to slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fughesi
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moiss
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write until my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that? Yaowa, you know who finna fall out
Definitively finish you, my fist take out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight

[Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cesspoolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text Rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the 'jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without rigging the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga
And you going to need the best doctors, house nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

[Hook]

[Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand) Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

[Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pump will stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
Bitch, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling "Go Shady!" Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy game over
[Eminem]
Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
[Yelawolf]
Game over!25 To Life Lyrics

[Produced by DJ Khalil & Danny Keyz]

[Hook]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

[Verse 1]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life
I woulda laid down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
No more pain, bitch, you took me for granted, took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it: I'mma take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now, goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid?
Look at how I dress: fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase, it's time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back, so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fucking left, I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept, it's unfortunate but it's

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
'til I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still, man
I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you: go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat, I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed
But this time I ain't changing my mind, I'm climbing out this abyss
You're screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served, bitch and it's just...

[Hook]313 Lyrics

[Hook]
Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus; my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent's my temperament
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impotent
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up
Well I'mma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will will be sealed your casket closed you still will be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jeru jackin' off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MC's and I'mma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow followers' singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands
If they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack

[Hook]3 6 5 Lyrics

[Hook- Skam (Eminem)]
Yo, I'm trying to be the man of the day, three-six-five a year
See the bullshit you saying, Skam ain't trying to hear (Fuck that!)
Busting lyrics in the air, keeping some up in the chamber
(Yo Skam, what the fuck you doing?) Man, I'm releasing anger!
(I'm trying to be the illest of the day, three six five a year
See that bullshit you saying, Shady ain't trying to hear
Spitting lyrics in your ear, keeping some up in the chamber)
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doing? (I'm releasing anger!)

[Skam]
Man I'm tired of being tired, every time I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of being late for the bus
Tired of all be blending, and ending up dating sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold digging bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fitting, girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear, spitting like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't comb it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
At every industry party, getting so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Trying to roll up on Miami, leaving with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stacking up white rappers like I'm throwing gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposing the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fucking shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jamming like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doing?)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
"I just wanna figure something in my head
And maybe you can help me out here
When a person is insane, as you clearly are
Do you know that you're insane?
And you're just sitting around reading Guns & Ammo
Masturbating in your own feces
Do you just stop and go
"Wow, it's just amazing how fucking crazy I really am"?"

[Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

[Hook]3 a.m. Lyrics

[Intro]
There is no escaping, there's no place to hide
You scream someone save me, but they don't pay no mind
Goodnight, goodbye

[Verse 1]
You're walking down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the morning and you're in a, nightmare it's horrible
Right there's the coroner, waiting for ya
To turn the corner so he can corner ya, you're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
All ya want is to rest cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again, swallowing a Klonopin
While I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and
Make sure I got all of it, wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must'a just blacked out again, not again

[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the morning, put my key in the door
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must'a killed 'em, killed 'em

[Verse 2]
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and Lanolin
Bust all over the wall panelin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantle and
Grab my flannel and my bandana then kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors and pins
Jesus, when does it end?
Phases that I go through, dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do? Hey, the prodigal son
The diabolical one, very methodical when I slaughter them

[Hook]

[Bridge]
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

[Verse 3]
I cut and I slash, slice and gash
Last night was a blast, I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint of the Jack
My last Vic and a half, a fleshlight of Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was: I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights, pushed him into the stinkin' tub
Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta drink his bath water, that oughta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me; that might be an artery, son
Your bloodcurdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's gotta be one
Oh no, there's probably none, he can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs, but ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up

[Hook]

Evil... Rise (X8)3hree6ix5ive Lyrics

(Chorus)
Skam:
Yo I'm tryin to be the man of the day
Three six five a year
See the bullshit you sayin, Skam ain't tryin to hear (Fuck that!)
Bustin lyrics in the air
Keepin some up in the chamber

Eminem:
Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin?

Skam:
Man, I'm releasin anger

Eminem :
I'm tryin to be the illest of the day
Three six five a year
See that bullshit you sayin, Shady ain't tryin to hear
Spittin lyrics in your ear
Keepin some up in the chamber

Skam:
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doin?

Shady:
I'm releasin anger

[Verse 1: Skam]
Man I'm tired of bein tired, everytime I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin, and endin up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold diggin bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin, girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't comb it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
At every industry party, gettin so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin to roll up on Miami, leavin with a broke neck
Oh shit, leathal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin up white rappers like im throwin gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposin the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doin?)

(Chorus)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last ode that I snifed the cane
Yo know your spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is, turnin to yellow with orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genuis, too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin
You gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each others name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to lovers lane, to the night you were started
Cock block your fathers game
I'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left, then to hope out
I'mma throw a head-but so hard, I'll knock us both out

(Chorus)3 Verses Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd, Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

[Verse 2]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin an acappella that'll chop a fella
To Mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvicet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crobar to pry her apart with

[Verse 3]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowing up your house killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!4 Verses Lyrics

[Verse 4]
Yo, yo, yo!
My mom sent up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming "GET HIM!"
I grabbed one,  lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen

(Damn... damn... damn...)50 Ways Lyrics

Verse 1:
You probably gonna think that I'm talking
About you and you goddamn right I am
Look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you
Subliminally, but I think criminal instinct
Has pushed me to the brink, my pussy does it stink
He still loves me cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And is no risk of disease cause he ain't with anyone is he?
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?
I told this cunt she's gonna over-do it once
And once she does, she was stuffed up in a trunk
Crunch, he scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy
Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
You cunning little cunt, deceitful witch
You thought you had me, 'till my shrink told me this

Hook:
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover

Verse 2:
I feel like a serial killer I keep dumping bodies in the lake
I'mma get caught and send up the river I shiver
When I think of the company I keep
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep
I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
Sex kept us together, when we slept together every-thing
Was all better, she made me feel like a king
Slowly, she began lowering my self-esteem
She go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her
And I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream 'n holla"
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do, call her out on it, we just argue
Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
Ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch
A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
She thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this

Hook:
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free

[Verse 1: Shabaam Shadeeq]
Of course I rap till I'm hoarse
Add the sauce to them jive turkey MCs
Say what you like, I toss
Your theory when you hear me like the guts of a dutch
Snap caught you in the act like Vivitar AF
2-5-5 Autofocus clear vision
Precision mics for people of all types
Call the calvary
Mic brutality, switch the pitch gradually
Aqua, turn-table knocka
Fresh like Binaca
Jot the thoughts in my chronicles
Remarkable styles
Made an exit to spark mine
Nuclear physics, mechanicals and phat rhymes
They know the time like a sundial
I'm X-File

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Went to Bible class with a gun, blasted a nun
Fuck Hell, Satan sent my ass to the sun
I wasn't born, I was hatched
And dumped in the trash with a note attached
Sayin' someone please whip this brat's ass
I never gave a rat's ass or a flyin' fuck
Drivin' drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
Slammin' the brakes, skiddin' out cause the tires suck
Went to pull you off my dick and got the pliers stuck
You better run cause I'm probably the only one
Crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife and stab you with a gun
I like fire, you might see me start it
I'm slightly retarded, I miss my sanity since the night we departed

[Verse 3: Skam]
Yo Old World Disorder on some outnumber shit
We'd rather go out of control then to be under it
Yo how you gonna win against us when we got nothin to lose
Must be confused
Or prayin to a God that don't exist
It wouldn't save your Bible-kissin asses even if he did
We like to twist ya mystic, genetic dead-end
Don't got friends
Skam and Shadowman, posting children for depression
Stress in any language
Say my name in Spanish
That's "Chupacabra", suck the life out of you
There won't be enough of your brain left to fill a teaspoon
We two vanishing men that makes the bad things blend
And probably go platinum on the day that the world ends

"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."

[Verse 4: A.L.]
When it comes to beef
I gets relief when I kill and breathe
Send a wreathe get your family ready for the grief
I'll knock ya teeth
Take ya seat like a thief
Make you change your beliefs
Burn a leaf before you go beneath
Rappers, I kill 'em
Down to Hell is where I send 'em
Feelin' my pen is illin so much
I need some penicillin
Jams I'm spillin cause I'm bound here
Kicking shit that's solitaire
Your crown is RIP cause rapper you sound counterfeit
You get a round of clips
If you play hard
You stay scarred
Thinkin you're brave ya'll
You're in a graveyard
One in a mil' son
I'm ill when it comes to skills
Wanna get killed or catch a dum-dum in your grill
Rappers diminishin, in scrimmage
I'm good to the finish
I'll speak in English while your brothers are speakin in gibberish
You touch the mic and I'm out to bury your fingers
You want some fame? I'll beat you up in front of Jerry Springer
So pay the price, say they nice
When they play the dice
I'll take you life, slay you twice
Before you break your rights

[Verse 5: Kwest Tha Madd Lad]
Cats who rap are feminine
I'm sendin this without the benefits of cinema scents of cinnamon
So submit it in your mental
Since you find it essential to stencil simple sentences
A sentence is simple
You banned from usin writin utensils
Whether crayon, pen or pencil
Observe verse packed with syntax
That causes skin cracks on impact
Send them wack men back to the lab
Where most of them laugh
I can hand you a manual to make what I plan to do more tangible
You still wouldn't understand the full concept
It slips through your fingers like sand granules
Scan the land and the blue sea annually
And you will see
Which animals eat amphibians from spittin up that written stuff
It’s all the same
It’s the reason for cyphers prematurely spittin' up
Ironic phonics show my flow is far from ambionic
To be honest no hits of chronic in mi bionic
I'm beyond it
The texture of my lecture is complex like a professor
Skeptics greet me exceptional when I bless sound receptacles
Much stretchin through my vestibules
Turns crews to vegetables
They grab my testicles and cup em
Fuck em, bless em through, what6 in the Morning Lyrics

[Intro: Eminem]
Good morning!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Y'all with us or what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, BITCH!

[Eminem]
For whatever it's worth, it's worth me having my ass whipped
Cause I'mma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
I just can't get passed these little pissants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it, cause we can and they can't spit
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens and I snap then it's a wrap
Then it's a scrap and it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-hop isn't a sport anymore
When you gotta go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but my passion
Is to smash anyone rapping without having to slap him
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol
When I'm pissed now, but it all depends on just how
Far it gets took on the mic
Cause I'm telling you right now you're not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a pitbull, you get bit, B
Your words stick to you like crazy glue when you diss me
Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets do 50
I'm the beautiful-est thing, and you're gonna miss me
When I'm gone, like Keith Murray when he threw his stool
And hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy and Proof - are you with me?

[Hook: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on IN
Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

[Swifty]
They consider me the epitome of a beef starter
In the party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs, I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly popping slugs, they hot son, better not run (AHH!)
The bosses of all bosses; a holocaust to whoever ain't cautious
In a house full of dog shit
I'm a Gothic death prophet, you'll stop breathing
You'll die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading
When you meet me better speak like it's Seasons Greetings
Either that or we'll be beefing frequent
You niggas need an E just to speak shit
In your window there's a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I'll snipe you with it and won't even keep it a secret
Nigga, I did it from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks sway you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

[Hook]

[Kon Artis]
I heard you niggas don't like us but so what, this beef is like what the fuck
Did he say in his rap? Em, I can see that he just a punk
I mean these niggas'll squeeze on me pleased when seeing guts
I don’t need no enemies, just my family, a couple trucks
And my MPC and a mic, they empty out on them bike
To fight you in front of everyone important that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say, "Fuck you bitch and I don't like you!"
WHAT! I might as well give this up, but that'd be selfish as fuck
You'll leave D12 in this, but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, C'MON!

[Kuniva]
I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys, but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust you better bust back or get your guts clapped
Outta your stomach, and when they want it
I'll bring a hundred niggas from Runyon so get to gunnin if you coming

[Hook]8 Mile Lyrics

[Eminem]
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up {​*wham*}​ I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

[Hook]
I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

[Eminem]
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road

[Hook]

[Eminem]
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show, to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

[Hook]8 mile - 313 Freestyle Lyrics

[Freestyle: B-Rabbit]
Your style is generic
Mines authentic made
I roll like a renegade
You need clinic aid
My technique is bizarre and ill;
I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya
That’s all that took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You want to battle
You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push
Someone that I can bully
Wait a minute I don’t think you understand fully
See me without a style
Is like mustard without the Hienz’s
I lead the new school
You a BUSTA without the RHYMES
I crush the shit out your lines8 Mile Background Music Lyrics

[Rabbit]
Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313, put your motherfucking hands up
Look, look

Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf
1, 2, 3, and to the 4
1 Pac, 2 Pac, 3 Pac, 4
4 Pac, 3 Pac, 2 Pac, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfucking MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, fuck the Free World
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dog, you embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look in his fucking yearbook
Fuck Cranbrook

Fuck the beat, I'll go a capella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me8 Mile: Lily's Lullaby Lyrics

[Verse 1: Eminem]

I know this girl
And her name is Lily
And its past her bed
T-I-M-E
She goes to sleep
And she can just dream
And not have to be
In a stinky trailer wit me
So when i feel blue
And dont know what to do
I look at you
And i just say... *Rasberry Noise*8 Mile Road Lyrics

It's okay, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
[Incomprehensible]

Sometimes I just feel like, quitting I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' wit real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics

And show these people what my level of skills like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like

Uh, da di da , it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's

Just been stripped, I have just been ripped
So I must then get, off this bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm going the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 mile road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back

8 mile road, and I'm gone, I know right where I'm going
Sorry mama I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't following no footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road

I'm walking these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP

And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the T.V, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand

While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from something I never wanted so bad!

Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressures too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best

And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' You, God
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job

Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby I'm never to far

But yo I gotta get out there the only way that I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 mile road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back

8 mile road, and I'm gone, I know right where I'm going
Sorry mama I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't following no footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road

You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't it still is
To be walkin' this boarder line of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate

Of authenticity, you've never even seen
But it's everthing to me, it's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smelled, or met a real MC
Who's incredible on the same pedestal as me

But yet still unsigned, having a rough time
Sit on the porch wit all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?

Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go, who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it

Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the salvation army tryin' to salvage an outfit

And it's cold tryin' to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, and one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun

There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin

Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin' I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got

But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no falling no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature

I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred

Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
