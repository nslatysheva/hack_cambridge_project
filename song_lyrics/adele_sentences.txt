HELLO LYRICS
VERSE 1
HELLO IT'S ME
I WAS WONDERING IF AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
YOU'D LIKE TO MEET TO GO OVER EVERYTHING
THEY SAY THAT TIME'S SUPPOSED TO HEAL YA
BUT I AIN'T DONE MUCH HEALING
HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME
I'M IN CALIFORNIA DREAMING ABOUT WHO WE USED TO BE
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER AND FREE
I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW IT FELT BEFORE THE WORLD FELL AT OUR FEET
THERE'S SUCH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US
AND A MILLION MILES
CHORUS
HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIDE
I MUST'VE CALLED A THOUSAND TIMES
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE
BUT WHEN I CALL YOU NEVER SEEM TO BE HOME
HELLO FROM THE OUTSIDE
AT LEAST I CAN SAY THAT I'VE TRIED
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR BREAKING YOUR HEART
BUT IT DON'T MATTER IT CLEARLY DOESN'T TEAR YOU APART ANYMORE
VERSE 2
HELLO HOW ARE YOU
IT'S SO TYPICAL OF ME TO TALK ABOUT MYSELF I'M SORRY
I HOPE THAT YOU'RE WELL
DID YOU EVER MAKE IT OUT OF THAT TOWN
WHERE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED
IT'S NO SECRET
THAT THE BOTH OF US ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME
CHORUS
SO HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIDE
I MUST'VE CALLED A THOUSAND TIMES
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE
BUT WHEN I CALL YOU NEVER SEEM TO BE HOME
HELLO FROM THE OUTSIDE
AT LEAST I CAN SAY THAT I'VE TRIED
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR BREAKING YOUR HEART
BUT IT DON'T MATTER IT CLEARLY DOESN'T TEAR YOU APART ANYMORE
BRIDGE
OOOOOHH ANYMORE
OOOOOHH ANYMORE
OOOOOHH ANYMORE
ANYMORE
CHORUS
HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIDE
I MUST'VE CALLED A THOUSAND TIMES
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE
BUT WHEN I CALL YOU NEVER SEEM TO BE HOME
HELLO FROM THE OUTSIDE
AT LEAST I CAN SAY THAT I'VE TRIED
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR BREAKING YOUR HEART
BUT IT DON'T MATTER IT CLEARLY DOESN'T TEAR YOU APART ANYMORE

VERSE 1
I ONLY WANTED TO HAVE FUN
LEARNING TO FLY LEARNING TO RUN
I LET MY HEART DECIDE THE WAY
WHEN I WAS YOUNG
DEEP DOWN I MUST HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN
THAT THIS WOULD BE INEVITABLE
TO EARN MY STRIPES I'D HAVE TO PAY
AND BARE MY SOUL
CHORUS
I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO REGRETS THE THINGS THEY'VE DONE
SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL IT'S ONLY ME
WHO CANT STAND THE REFLECTION THAT THEY SEE
I WISH I COULD LIVE A LITTLE MORE
LOOK UP TO THE SKY NOT JUST THE FLOOR
I FEEL LIKE MY LIFE IS FLASHING BY
AND ALL I CAN DO IS WATCH AND CRY
I MISS THE AIR I MISS MY FRIENDS
I MISS MY MOTHER I MISS IT WHEN
LIFE WAS A PARTY TO BE THROWN
BUT THAT WAS A MILLION YEARS AGO
VERSE 2
WHEN I WALK AROUND ALL OF THE STREETS
WHERE I GREW UP AND FOUND MY FEET
THEY CAN'T LOOK ME IN THE EYE
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE SCARED OF ME
I TRY TO THINK OF THINGS TO SAY
LIKE A JOKE OR A MEMORY
BUT THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE ME NOW
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY
CHORUS
I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO REGRETS THE THINGS THEY'VE DONE
SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL IT'S ONLY ME
WHO CANT STAND THE REFLECTION THAT THEY SEE
I WISH I COULD LIVE A LITTLE MORE
LOOK UP TO THE SKY NOT JUST THE FLOOR
I FEEL LIKE MY LIFE IS FLASHING BY
AND ALL I CAN DO IS WATCH AND CRY
I MISS THE AIR I MISS MY FRIENDS
I MISS MY MOTHER I MISS IT WHEN
LIFE WAS A PARTY TO BE THROWN
BUT THAT WAS A MILLION YEARS AGO25 THANK YOU LETTER LYRICS

PACK HELLO LYRICS
VERSE 1
HELLO IT'S ME
I WAS WONDERING IF AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
YOU'D LIKE TO MEET TO GO OVER EVERYTHING
THEY SAY THAT TIME'S SUPPOSED TO HEAL YA
BUT I AIN'T DONE MUCH HEALING
HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME
I'M IN CALIFORNIA DREAMING ABOUT WHO WE USED TO BE
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER AND FREE
I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW IT FELT BEFORE THE WORLD FELL AT OUR FEET
THERE'S SUCH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US
AND A MILLION MILES
CHORUS
HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIDE
I MUST'VE CALLED A THOUSAND TIMES
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE
BUT WHEN I CALL YOU NEVER SEEM TO BE HOME
HELLO FROM THE OUTSIDE
AT LEAST I CAN SAY THAT I'VE TRIED
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR BREAKING YOUR HEART
BUT IT DON'T MATTER IT CLEARLY DOESN'T TEAR YOU APART ANYMORE
VERSE 2
HELLO HOW ARE YOU
IT'S SO TYPICAL OF ME TO TALK ABOUT MYSELF I'M SORRY
I HOPE THAT YOU'RE WELL
DID YOU EVER MAKE IT OUT OF THAT TOWN
WHERE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED
IT'S NO SECRET
THAT THE BOTH OF US ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME
CHORUS
SO HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIDE
I MUST'VE CALLED A THOUSAND TIMES
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE
BUT WHEN I CALL YOU NEVER SEEM TO BE HOME
HELLO FROM THE OUTSIDE
AT LEAST I CAN SAY THAT I'VE TRIED
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR BREAKING YOUR HEART
BUT IT DON'T MATTER IT CLEARLY DOESN'T TEAR YOU APART ANYMORE
BRIDGE
OOOOOHH ANYMORE
OOOOOHH ANYMORE
OOOOOHH ANYMORE
ANYMORE
CHORUS
HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIDE
I MUST'VE CALLED A THOUSAND TIMES
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE
BUT WHEN I CALL YOU NEVER SEEM TO BE HOME
HELLO FROM THE OUTSIDE
AT LEAST I CAN SAY THAT I'VE TRIED
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY FOR BREAKING YOUR HEART
BUT IT DON'T MATTER IT CLEARLY DOESN'T TEAR YOU APART ANYMORE

VERSE 1
SOME SAY I'LL BE BETTER WITHOUT YOU
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW YOU LIKE I DO
OR AT LEAST THE SIDES I THOUGHT I KNEW
I CAN'T BEAR THIS TIME
IT DRAGS ON AS I LOSE MY MIND
REMINDED BY THINGS I FIND
LIKE NOTES AND CLOTHES YOU LEFT BEHIND
WAKE ME UP WAKE ME UP WHEN ALL IS DONE
I WON'T RISE UNTIL THIS BATTLE'S WON
MY DIGNITY'S BECOME UNDONE
HOOK 1
BUT I WON'T GO
I CAN'T DO IT ON MY OWN

I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK
BUT I WON'T GO
I CAN'T DO IT ON MY OWN
IF THIS AIN'T LOVE THEN WHAT IS
I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK
VERSE 2
SO PETRIFIED I'M SO SCARED TO STEP INTO THIS RIDE
WHAT IF I LOSE MY HEART AND FAIL DECLINED
I WON'T FORGIVE ME IF I GIVE UP TRYING
I HEARD HIS VOICE TODAY
I DIDN'T KNOW A SINGLE WORD HE SAID
NOT ONE RESEMBLANCE TO THE MAN I MET
JUST A VACANT BROKEN BOY INSTEAD
HOOK 1
BUT I WON'T GO
I CAN'T DO IT ON MY OWN
IF THIS AIN'T LOVE THEN WHAT IS
I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK
BUT I WON'T GO
I CAN'T DO IT ON MY OWN
IF THIS AIN'T LOVE THEN WHAT IS
I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK
THERE WILL BE TIMES
WE'LL TRY AND GIVE IT UP
BURSTING AT THE SEAMS NO DOUBT
WE'LL ALMOST FALL APART THEN BURN THE PIECES
TO WATCH THEM TURN TO DUST
BUT NOTHING WILL EVER TAINT US
BRIDGE
WILL HE
WILL HE STILL REMEMBER ME
WILL HE STILL LOVE ME EVEN WHEN HE'S FREE
OR WILL HE GO BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE HE WOULD CHOOSE THE POISON OVER ME
WHEN WE SPOKE YESTERDAY
HE SAID TO HOLD MY BREATH AND SIT AND WAIT
I'LL BE HOME SO SOON I WON'T BE LATE
HOOK 2
HE WON'T GO
HE CAN'T DO IT ON HIS OWN
IF THIS AIN'T LOVE THEN WHAT IS
HE'S WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK
SO I WON'T GO
HE CAN'T DO IT ON HIS OWN
IF THIS AIN'T LOVE THEN WHAT IS
I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK
CAUSE HE WON'T GO
HE CAN'T DO IT ON HIS OWN
IF THIS AIN'T LOVE THEN WHAT IS
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK
HOOK
