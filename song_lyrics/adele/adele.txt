Hello Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret
That the both of us are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Music Video]When We Were Young Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Bridge]
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
Cause I guess I still care, do you still care?

[Pre-Chorus]
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Outro]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were youngAll I Ask Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

[Verse 2]
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

[Bridge]
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is...

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?Send My Love (To Your New Lover) Lyrics

[Intro]
Just the guitar?
Okay, cool

[Verse 1]
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on on my body and told me
Told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting, you and me
Mmm, that was what you told me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Verse 2]
I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)
Mmm, baby I'm so rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)
Mmm, there's only one way down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Bridge]
If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Outro]
If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more25 [Tracklist + Album Cover] Lyrics

[Verse 1]
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh and if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woaah, woaaah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woaah, woaaah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

[Outro]
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridgeMillion Years Ago Lyrics

[Produced by Greg Kurstin]

[Verse 1]
I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

[Chorus]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can’t stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother; I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

[Verse 2]
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

[Chorus]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can’t stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother; I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago25 Thank You Letter Lyrics

Thank you for the time I've been given
Thank you to everybody for your love and kindness, for your honesty and persuasion
Thank you for telling me how it is but entertaining what I wanted it to be
Thank you for listening and for letting me into your lives again

Love Adele xAlive Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone
I played on my own
I survived
Hey
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive

[Verse 2]
I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive

[Post-Chorus]
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing

[Bridge]
I have made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went in and got it
Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you

[Chorus]
And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive

[Outro]
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm aliveAll I Ask Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

[Verse 2]
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

[Bridge]
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is...

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?Best For Last Lyrics

[Produced by Jim Abbiss]

[Verse 1]
Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end
And it's been waitin' for you to open up
Just you baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how
I like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

[Bridge]
That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

[Chorus]
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me

[Verse 2]
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough, you're still not mentionin' love?
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm takin' these chances and gettin' nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say

[Bridge]
I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

[Chorus]
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

[Verse 3]
But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak runnin' around
And I will do until I find myself with you

[Outro]
And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for youBillboard 200 Chart History Lyrics

25Can't Let Go Lyrics

[Verse 1]
When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know I can't let go

[Verse 2]
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know I can't let go

[Bridge]
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

[Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let goChasing Pavements Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love
But if I tell the world, I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I'd end up with you

[Hook]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

[Verse 2]
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Wait then as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it?

[Hook]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

[Bridge]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?

[Hook]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?Cold Shoulder Lyrics

[Produced by Mark Ronson]

[Verse 1]
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it ‘round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

[Verse 2]
These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

[Bridge]
Time and time again I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you came in
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was herCrazy For You Lyrics

Found myself today
Singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sittin' in the dark
Wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy
But its you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in
I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils
It's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for youDaydreamer Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

[Verse 2]
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

[Chorus]
You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

[Verse 3]
Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

[Bridge]
There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for

[Chorus]
But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for lifeDon't You Remember Lyrics

[Verse 1]
When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the state we were in

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Verse 2]
When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Bridge]
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

[Chorus]
Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Outro]
When will I see you again?Hella O's (Freestyle) Lyrics

[Intro: Adele]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll one up and let's get high
I am tryin' to get fri-ii-ed

You trying get high and I'm tryna toke
Hit this weed once don't you choke, oh oh oh

My bitch bad and my kush strong, uh uh uh uh uh
I be right I don't be wrong
I smoke weed all day long
Wake up too and go to sleep with that
Pack...Hello Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret
That the both of us are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Music Video]He Won't Go Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew

I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind

Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

[Hook 1]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

[Verse 2]
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail declined?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying

I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vacant broken boy instead

[Hook 1]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

There will be times
We'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us

[Bridge]
Will he... will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he would choose the poison over me?

When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
"I'll be home so soon, I won't be late"

[Hook 2]
He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk

So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk

[Hook]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the riskHiding My Heart Lyrics

[Verse 1]
This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
And It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Verse 2]
Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home, I call that home

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Verse 3]
Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can spend my whole life hiding my heart awayHometown Glory Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam
I ain't lost, just wandering"

[Hook]
Round my hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, ooo, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world

[Verse 2]
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

[Hook]

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my worldHot 100 Chart History Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees

[Hook]
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

[Verse 2]
So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, "Will you leave your man?"
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you

[Hook]
Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

[Bridge]
I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes
And settle for wrong and ignore the right

[Hook]
When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now, but I don't need youI'll Be Waiting Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters, but you pushed me in
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
But we had time against us, miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up I'll do everything different I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up I'll be somebody different I'll be better to you

[Verse 2]
Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me and pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn

[Pre-Chorus]
But we had time against us, miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless
I'll be waiting

[Chorus]I Miss You Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna teach you things you never knew, ooh baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
Then kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

[Verse 2]
I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
Baby, bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

[Bridge]
We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder, baby
It only makes it harder, baby
Harder baby, harder baby

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

[Outro]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
