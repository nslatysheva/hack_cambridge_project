Out of the Woods Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

[Post-Chorus]
(Are we out of the wo-o-ods?!)

[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (last december)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

[Post-Chorus]
(Are we out of the wo-o-ods?!)

[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
20 stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
I remember, oh I remember

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? GoodBad Blood (Remix) Lyrics

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was O.G. like DOC, remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge: Taylor Swift (Kendrick Lamar)]
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!Wildest Dreams Lyrics

[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is...

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha

[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha

[Bridge] (x2)
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

[Chorus - Variation]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
Wildest dreams, ah-aah haBlank Space Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love’s a game, want to play?
New money, suit & tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless, we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby and I'll write your name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies, I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies, you're the King baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want, be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms, I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?", I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless, we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby and I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless, we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby and I'll write your nameBad Blood Lyrics

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!Style Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a  while since I have even heard from you
Heard from you
I should just tell you to leave
Cause I know exactly where it leads
But I watch us go round and round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat
I say "I've heard - oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl"
He says "What you heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I"
I said "I've been there too a few times"

[Chorus]
Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Just take me home

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back everytime
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of styleClean Lyrics

[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back-and-forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
And I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2]
There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
And I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
And I think I am finally clean

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
And I think I am finally clean1989 Liner Notes Lyrics

[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnigh
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uht

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, uh uh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you wanted to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22
22

[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded, too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh
(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about
The heartbreaks, it's time
Oh oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you wanted to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22
22
I don't know about you
22, 22

[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news, I gotta have you
I gotta have you

[Chorus]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you wanted to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22
22
Dancing like 22, yeah, 22, yeah yeah

[Outro]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news, I gotta have you
I gotta have youAin't Nothing 'Bout You Lyrics

[Intro]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me

[Verse 1]
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

Whoa

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you got to do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

[Chorus]

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

[Outro]
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for meAll  Too Well Lyrics

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in a car getting lost Upstate
The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were looking' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well

Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I´d like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, cause you remember it all too well

Because there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too wellAll You Had To Do Was Stay Lyrics

[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

[Pre-Chorus]
(Stay) hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay) hey
Now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well could have been easy

[Chorus]
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was stay

[Verse 2]
Here you are now calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
(Stay) hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay) hey
Now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well could have been easy

[Chorus]
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was stay

[Bridge]
Let me remind you
This was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this, not like this

[Pre-Chorus]
(Stay) hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay) hey
Now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well could have been easy

[Chorus]
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was stayA Perfectly Good Heart Lyrics

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

[Verse]
Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

[Chorus](x2)A Place In This World Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Outro]
Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh I'm just a girlBaby, Don't You Break My Heart Slow Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

[[Pre-Chorus]
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever

[Chorus]
Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

[Verse 2]
I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you say
Do you say what you mean?
When you say our love could last forever

[Chorus]

Oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

[Chorus]
But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Now baby don't you break my heart
SlowBack To December Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Interlude]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December...

[Chorus]
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
And I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Outro]
All the timeBad Blood Lyrics

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!Bad Blood (Remix) Lyrics

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was O.G. like DOC, remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge: Taylor Swift (Kendrick Lamar)]
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Catastrophe Vs. HomesliceBeautiful Eyes Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why
I want to be somewhere where you are
I want to be where

[Chorus]
You're here, You're eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

[Verse 2]
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while I'll cry
Cause you're my lullaby
SO baby come hold me tight cause I-I
I want to be everything you need
I want to be where

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about
Dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, Eyes Beautiful eyesBegin Again Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause
He never did
I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again

[Verse 2]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And we walked down the block, to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time
What's past is past

[Chorus + Outro]Better Than Revenge Lyrics

[Intro]
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Whoa, whoa-ah-oh

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

[Outro]
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
And show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotageBlank Space Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love’s a game, want to play?
New money, suit & tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless, we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby and I'll write your name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies, I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies, you're the King baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want, be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms, I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?", I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless, we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby and I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless, we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby and I'll write your nameBlank Space (Voice Memo) Lyrics

So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called "Blank Space," and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the "Oh!" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called "Blank Space."

"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things..."Both of Us Lyrics

[Hook: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Ever thought about losing it
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge about 20 times
But still can’t find no food in it
That’s foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
Cause if life is an uphill battle
But y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just asking
What’s the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain’t a number one draft pick
Most of us ain’t Hollywood actors
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
For all the times no one’s ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like you’re just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where would've wound up
Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all

[Hook]Breathe Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Because none of us thought it was
Going to end that way
People are people
And sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm

Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you
Don't really want to see
Because it's tragedy and it'll only bring you
Down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

[Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to
Save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't
Breathe
Without you but I have to breathe
Without you but I have to

[Verse 2]
Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people
And sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is going to save us from the fall out

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's 2 A.M
Feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy
Easy for me
It's 2 A.M
Feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this aren’t easy
Easy for me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Sorry, sorry
Sorry, (Yeah eh) sorry
Sorry, sorry
SorryBrought Up That Way Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says "Baby girl what's wrong with you?"
She says "Please don't make me go back there again"

She said "I wish there was some way
To make them stop it"
So he drives down to
That principles office and says

[Chorus]
"I didn't bring her up
So they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way"

[Verse 2]
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say
She said "He tried but
There's just some things I won't do"
And through the tears
She said "I couldn't do that to you"
And he said

[Chorus]
"I didn't bring you up
So he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life
To see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way"

[Verse 3]
The phone rings on a rainy night
Says "It's officer tate"
He said "Sir, there's been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an over pass
And Emily, she's fading fast"

He says "God, I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me today
They put her own momma in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive
Was that little girl's smile
So please don't take that away
It won't be easy taking her today
She wasn't brought up that way"

[Outro]
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes
