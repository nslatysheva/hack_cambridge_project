U Can't Touch This Lyrics

[Hook]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

[Verse 1]
My, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say "Oh my Lord"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

[Hook]
I told you homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we living and you know (You can't touch this)
Look at my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

[Verse 2]
Fresh new kicks, advance
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling, hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

[Hook]
Yo, I told you (You can't touch this)
Why you standing there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka (You can't touch this)

[Verse 3]
Give me a song, or rhythm
Make 'em sweat, that's what I'm giving 'em
Now, they know
You talking about the Hammer you talking about a show
That's hype, and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
You can't touch this
Break it down! (Music breaks down)

Stop!

Hammer time

Go with the funk, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump
Break it down! (Nice pants, Hammer)

Stop!

Hammer time

Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others making records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer"
And the rest can go and play2 Legit 2 Quit Lyrics

Too legit... Too legit to quit
Sweat running all over my chest

Well everyday too make hits, you ain't got it
Til this day you never ? never had it
For me I tend to kick it like a partner
And must I remind you I'm the funky headhunter

Chorus (4x)

Better run, better run run
Better run, better run run, let's go there
Let's go there

[Verse 1]
Let's go where the lights is hot
Where a rapper gotta back up all the shit he pop
Let's go there, the game is so cold
I could see it in his eyes, the boy sold his soul
Devil said "I'ma give you the world"
"I'll take it, plus give me a girl
Mr. Devil, can you give me a sign?"
He said "Throw the Roc up, thats one of mine"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo Jay, I got a reason to doubt
If I knocked on your door would you come on out?
If I knocked on your door that mean I'm knocking you out
If I knocked on your door boy, I'll bust ya in ya mouth
Uh, see me, son, I don't play
I come from the shoulders, that's two the hard way
New rules, let me show you the way
If a rapper talk tough, he gotta back up what he say

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I don't really have to go in on a fella
But that dude wrote back to devil
Nah nah, I don't rock your wear
Your shoes, I don't need a dark pair
That boy tried to steal my swag
Fingerprints all over the bag
Imposter, get him outta here
Imposter, the king is right here, lets go

[Hook]

Yeah you're now rocking with the king of heart
The king of heart, tearing all imposters apartToo Late Playa Lyrics

[Intro]
I'm already known (get at her, get at her, get at her)
But I'm already known Yo (then go on and get at her, get at her)
But I told you
I'm already known (get at her, get at her, get at her)
If I get at her it's just too late
I'm gone (put your back in, put your back in)

[Verse 1: MC Hammer:]
Steps on the scene, dressed G.Q
Peepin' out these industries freaks wearing dresses you can see through
Hammer time, I'm ready to party
Afterwards get naughty, let's wear Versace
You with your man, but you still looking
Looking good, and healthy like Patty Label's cook
Aight, [?] tell your man you gotta peepee
Run free freak, a free freak can see me
Now that I gotcha baby, What's your name?
(What's up love, my name is Queen)
(Why don't you wait right here honey)
(While I go shake this busta)
No problem, handle your business and let's go
I guess he's not satisfying, she said;
"Hammer would you sign the tits so my man won't think I was lying"
PS. We on our way home, too late play I got your girl and I'm gone

[Chorus: Danny Boy]
Too late, too late playa bye byeeee!
I got your girl and I'm gone
Too late, too late playa bye byeeee!
I got your girl and I'm gone

[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane:]
Realize the game is staying tight (yes)
Forever playing right, playa haters sayin' "he ain't right"
What's the matter, (what?) no confidence within your data
I see you trippin' since I first started lookin' at her
And if she peep, then you know she'll creep
And if you sleep, then that will be just one you won't keep (look at cha)
Boy you know you need your ass whipped
For holdin' on her hand like you going on a first grade class trip
You feel unable, to keep her in your stable
As she listens to the Crystal popping at the next table
Likes finer things, victory is mine again
You're tryin' to win, but got to come with better than those Heinekens (whoo!)
I got her open about the game I be using
And now she choosing, and you gon' came up as the one loosin'
The smooth criminal is out musclin', grand theft hustlin'
Black Ceasar, he gone struck again

[Chorus: Danny Boy]
Too late, too late playa bye byeeee!
I got your girl and I'm gone
Too late, too late playa bye byeeee!
I got your girl and I'm gone

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Looking delicious, blushes while I give you kisses
While I'm granting wishes, make ya boyfriend suspicious
Visits while doin' dishes in your daisy duke
Handle my business in the evening, spend my days with you
If it's true that you really taken, that bonds broke
So when your men get the shit mistaken, then let him know
You might be his girl, but see you'll always be my woman
Close your eyes think of me and keep cuming
Niggas Be swearin' that they savvy, claiming they game's cavy
Bitches be hittin' switches, calling 2Pac daddy
It ain't my fault that she's sprung on me
And ain't it fun to make her cum put her tongue on me
That's on the real homie, this is how it is when you play for keeps
If your game ain't straight, your bitch lay with me
And after me she'll probably fuck the next nigga too
Do I give a fuck who's number two
Long as I get mine

[Chorus: Danny Boy]
Too late, too late playa bye byeeee!
I got your girl and I'm gone
Too late, too late playa bye byeeee!
I got your girl and I'm gone

[Verse 5: Nutt-so]
Flossin' to the east don't slide, no 18's bumpin'
Truck stopping, sittin' way too clean
It's a Friday night, so let me slide by Kristy's
Swoop up like Frisbees, too damn fresh [?] for MC
Sucked up game, pursued my role
And slid to a beauty never G'd before

[Verse 6: MC Hammer]
Let's drink Crystal and hop in tha pool
Conversate about the real, not big, and keep it cool
I see you smiling, Girl whatcha smilin' for?
Lookin' sexy with your county buck wild flow
You like R Kelly?, You like what he produced through?
Well ya, I like to bump and grind too
Feel me

[Verse 7: Nutt-so]
Conversating, not trippin' where my hands at
Now she's relaxing wanna tell my how her man act
Excuse me, but do your man got my number baby
Cuz I up at your house with your coat, he keep on paging me
And your man, you know these digits? (what's up Nutt-so?)
You ain't nothing but her man, now ain't that wicked

[MC Hammer]
It ain't nothing but a damn shame (hello)
And it's very strange that my pager beeps the same thing

[Nutt-so & MC Hammer:]
So your man, and your man must be

[MC Hammer]
Trying to find clues on us and where we be

[Nutt-so & MC Hammer:]
But we ain't trippin', let's give' em a call
So they can cook for us and clean up after the dogs
Feel me

[Nutt-so]
Called him up, now you tell him he can come through
But he can't be up here acting a fool
After that he never heard from us

[Nutt-so & MC Hammer:]
And when he arrived it read
Too Late Playa do not disturb us

[Chorus: Danny Boy]
Too late, too late playa bye byeeee!
I got your girl and I'm gone
Too late, too late playa bye byeeee!
I got your girl and I'm gone
Too late, too late playa bye byeeee!
I got your girl and I'm goneThe Funky Headhunter Lyrics

Bust 'em in the back of they head
For those lies that I know that they said

[Verse 1: MC Hammer]
It's the one you can't touch, Pump it up, Turn it up
A brand new cut for the hammer to burn up
Suckers gettin mad cause over 20 million sold
And now they try to diss cause they can't get gold
I was born in a hole, [Yo!], Now I'm in Control [Yo!]
Bank boy deep is the way we roll [We roll!]
I'm mackin for the punks talkin the junk on the tracks
The hammer don't hurt 'em days are over, these are the days of the payback, payback
I'm up on the hill lookin down

Chorus 4x

[Verse 2: MC Hammer]

If ya got something on ya chest, Let it off
Cause we can get it on, Don't let the dance steps fool ya
Cause if I catch ya slippin, I'mma have to do ya, do ya
One to the chin, Another to the jaw
I know ya just bustas purpetrating like ya raw
Mash it, Trash it, Serch couldn't pass it
The trick's last album didn't even go plastic
Some claiming towns that they ain't even from
Some claiming they hard, But never shot a gun, Bustas!

Chorus 4x

Bust 'em in the back, Bust em, Bust em, Bust 'em in the back
And watch those suckas play dead!

[Verse 3: MC Hammer]
Straight from high street, Raised by the o.g.'s
Never slanged keys, But quick to drop them b's
Put 'em in the trunk and that ain't no front
Cause east oaktown didn't raise no punk
So sit up, Get up, Girls they get lit up
Check it!, Hammer came with the unexpected, I wrecked it
Quik, I gets mad wicked, I didn't check the rhyme cause Q-Tip couldn't kick it
And that punk Redman, I hit you with the back son
Talk is cheap, It's time time for some action
Gonna make you eat every word that you said
And a trick like you would end up dead, Red
But another talk about the moms and the pops
And when the joking stops, I'mma knock off ya block
And watch ya body drop the ya album straight flopped, Fool, Fool

[B-Down]
Trick runner, Beware of hammer

[MC Hammer]

[Hammer]
B-boys yo I'm so upset

Bite yo' tongue, but don't you run
The fight ain't over it's just begun
Listen real close I'll get you straight
This is no La-Di-Da-Di or a radio break
Grab yo' speakers, a paper, a pen
And pay close attention because the West is in
Servin this notice and you better take notes
The West is down and we ain't no joke

Head so big, give us respect

When the story is told, you act so bold
Leap like a frog if you think you're bold
I chew you like gum, and spit you out
You're nuttin but a fish, a smelt and not a trout
Fish boy liver when you see me you shiver

Rockin on the mic just to let you know
No denyin on what you've been tryin
The West ain't dead, yo' raps are dyin

And act like I was havin' a ball (ha ha)

Standin' about three feet tall (I'm outta here)

You know the hammer is with it (I'm with it)
Act a fool, no bones, swooop, goofy and randy

Scene I

Too Big and the Hammer rollin' on a hit
Knives in our hands to the sound of the click
And now we're ready, we hit the swoove
Windows ease down we spray their crews

Eight fools dead, a baby too
You ask me how I'm livin', this hit's for you
But that's not all we got the prize
A mother in a kitchen, now yo, she's dead inside

Yeah, we took them suckers out
They know what time it is now

[Chorus]
Scene II, me and Too Big at the club

Too Big and the Hammer kickin' it at the club
Boastin' about the way that we pulled those sucker's plugs
We weren't worried, naw, we didn't care
When you're in this war, yo, all is fair

A tap on my shoulder, I turn around
Too Big is dyin' fast, he's on the ground
I reach for my gat, it was too late
The knives went pointblank range in my face

Yo, they opened fire and took me out
Somebody tell my mother, I love her, man

[Chorus]
Scene III, the pimpin' game

Now I'm pimpin' these berries, got to get that money
Those suckers still payin' for a little bit of honey
Nothin' in this world can stop my flow
AIDS ain't done nothin' but help my business grow

My babes are trained to make that dollar
To take you out, fool, it ain't no bother
You dropped your pants and you pay the price
Your money maybe AIDS, fool, and then your life

Yeah, that's right cause a pimp got to make it
You know what I'm sayin'

We're talkin' about crime stories
And I ain't givin' up no propers, no glory

[Chorus]
Scene IV, the pimp got took out by Barry's brother

We got this tip on some new fresh bait
Money in their heads and they could hardly wait
My girls went to their room to make the play
Two suckers at once, yeah, would make my day

Now I'm outside some suckers walk up
Talkin' real hard about smokin' my butt
He pushed the button, the blade came out
Cut me on my throat and then a bullet in my mouth

I guess the devil got all the babes in hell
Maybe he'll let me work with him? Ssh

[Chorus]
And I'd like to say this before we get outta here

To my brothers in the game, my brothers
Who are out there doin' what they feel they've got to do
I wanna ask you one favor, let's let the young kids 10, 11, 12 years old
Let's let them go on and do their thing at the schoolhouse

Let's give them a chance to make it
Let's give them a chance at a different life
You doin' what you feel you have to do
But they youngsters and they don't know any better

So we want to give them a chance to live
I mean life is precious, and you know that yourself
And you try to make a better life for yourself

So what I'm sayin' this from the bottom of my heart, let the kids be
Help the children lead to another way
And peace from you and I love you and I'm outta hereFeel My Power Lyrics

[Hammer]
B-boys yo I'm so upset
Break it down hard for the West respect
Bite yo' tongue, but don't you run
The fight ain't over it's just begun
Listen real close I'll get you straight

Grab yo' speakers, a paper, a pen
And pay close attention because the West is in
Servin this notice and you better take notes

Head so big, give us respect

Voice like go boom and you know you're doomed
If you try to diss the West when the Hammer's in the room
When the story is told, you act so bold
Leap like a frog if you think you're bold
I chew you like gum, and spit you out
You're nuttin but a fish, a smelt and not a trout
Fish boy liver when you see me you shiver

Ah yeah, I'm glad I put this tape in
I'm just gon' cruise down the road
Look at the stars in the sky
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have
Of a love that my heart has been searching for
For so long, and I know somewhere
If I keep searching, that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love, a love I know I'll have
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last

I see her face and I can't let go
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that love
She's a thought and a vision in my memory
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love
(love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that the Hammer definetly needs
(please be mine)
Baby be mine
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
So why don't you be mine
The search is going on
From coast to coast
A women for the man, who's propping the most
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is beating strong
This love cannot be wrong
I need her and I want her, so come on to my home
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm a keep looking
At the movies, in my car, on my stereo
At a game of Different World or the Cosby Show
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
Yo veo, tell me what's up
At the track, at the club, or out buying dub
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, cause I'm in love
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad
(love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that I know I need
(please be mine)
Be mine baby
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
Why don't you be mine
(baby, be mine)
Where could she be?
At the store around the corner
Or wondering at night
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
Hammer, you know I'm looking
Calling all my friends all around the place
Guy, Lavertte, or my homey Rob Base
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
If you've peeped her out, tell me
Yo, veo on the phone
Ted, Dre, or Ed Lover
Fab Five, homeys won't you help a young brother
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I got a picture in my mind
The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like D-B magic, and why don't you appear
(have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face
I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love
Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?
The girl is hard to see like an unseen VJ
(have you seen her? tell me have you seen her? have you seen her?)Help the Children Lyrics

(Help them. Help our children. Help them. Help our children)

[Chorus]
Will you let them be? (Help the children)
Will you help the children live to see... (Help the children)
A generation's trying (bombs and crack)
Oh, how we're dying
(Dance, help them)
Will you let them be? (Help the children)
Will you help the children live to see... (Help the children)
A better day is coming (we need love)
To keep our lives going

[Verse 1]
Life is here and then it's gone
And what seems right can be oh-so wrong
Let's protect, and not molest... a young girl
And help them live to see... this world
Clearly, as it is
And pray for the mother with kids (kids)
Who's lost control, but not her soul
Many kids will die before they're 20 years old

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Pops (pops) where in the world have you gone
I see Momma (momma) by the telephone
Waiting (waiting) but you don't call
Tears on her face and I see them fall
It hurts (hurts) but will go on
You're just another brother who's left his home
And family (family), yeah we cry
Momma says she love you and I don't even know why (why why why)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Money and death, the lie, the truth
A dime bag of crack, the end of you
Black and white, a constant fight
Years and years, and day and night
There was a right, I've got to stand
To make a better way for a young black man
In a land (a land) where the people smile
Been holding me back for such a long while (while, while, wow, while)

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Help them, will you let them be?
Children (children) don't be fooled
And learn about the way that man was ruled
This country (country) where we live
And read about the sixties and what they did
So that we (we) won't forget
And love one another and give respect
When I see (see) a man who's old
A woman who's grey, it touches my soul
Because I know (know) they paved the way
So we could be here and live this way
There was a time (time) not long ago
When in the-front-of-the-bus into the back I had to go
It appears (it appears) that things have changed
Maybe it's in the method but it's still the same game (game, game, game, game, game, game)

BUST IT!It's All Good Lyrics

(Hey...)
(It's all good)
(It's all good)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh, it's all...)
(Hey...)
(It's all good)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh, it's all good)

Now this ain't the name calling game
See, I can refrain from using names to get paid
Since I'm known to creatin kinds of beats that make your rump shake
Records are great, But now let's set the record straight

(They thought you was a sellout)
I'm sellin' out tours cause sellin' cd's, I'm the one M. B
You wanna beat the G, I beat you like hizzos
In the backseat of my caddy you'll be callin' the Hammer daddy

I'll work you like a slave
Misbehavin' you were gonna
Pay tax on? My brothers soul

Hit the streets cornered?
And I refuse to forget that alright you talked tough
But face to face was a just a trick, bro

They put me in the mix, Too legit to quit
I came wit' a long list of it
And in the future you'll find me on the billboard
Or on the floor of the sign receiving music awards
And it's all good

(Hey...)
(It's all good)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh, it's all...)
(Hey...)
(It's all good)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh)

It's all good!
The talk you been talkin'
To talk that talk
You gotta walk that walk

Or the Hammer man's stalkin', So enter the dragon
And once you burned up, Those? Caught in dissin my bandwagon

Suckers, read billboard and weep
You in the hot seat where I'm from talk is cheap
And when I see ya, The styles you wrote man
A mean left hook took ya out, And it came from Oakland

Check it, You punks don't know me
A true O. G. Yo, I was runnin" the whole scene
You started talking all that mess But I'm callin" your bluff trick
I thought you new And boy you still can't touch, this

It's better than the average, bro
I'm not the average Joe, With the average flow
Yo I can still do things That you wish you could
You're talkin' all that lip, But I don't even trip
Cause it's all good

Chorus

I'm fed up, So now I gotta set 'em up
Knock em till I never, never ever let 'em up
But like a trick he might kick I'll be prepared to red 'em up
However, if you wanna slang em, Then we can get 'em up
Black sheep you're weak you're meek You're tryin' to grow feet
? I make ya look head But first, I'm a get your teeth
Talkin' about my mama's where I draw the line red
Dancin' with the corners of yo dome I'm a blow your mind, So!

Since I'm not the one who could be I'll
I feel the need say 'you wanna be' you gotta be real
Cause if ya ever come my way like I used to say
Homeboy you better pray just to make it today

I know what it is
The ratta tat piece of corny rhymes you keep sayin we don't find worth playin
I don't feel like I'm a gangsta so you claim that I'm a sellout
When we meet up on the street, then we'll see who bail out
And it's all good

ChorusLet's Get It Started Lyrics

Let's get it started!
Let's get it started!

[Verse 1]
Now your party wasn't jumping and your DJ was weak
Instead of dope beats, he was spinnin them Z's
All the fly girls who came with a beat in mind
They all up against the wall like a welfare line
Do you think for one minute that this is it?
Your party is bogus, Yo it ain't legit
You better PUT on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started
Get it started!

Let's get it started!
Let's get it started!
Let's get it started!
Let's get it started!
Let's get it started!

[Verse 2]
Now get up out your seat because my beat is so complete
I'm movin everybody from A to Z
And when it comes to straight up rockin, I'm second to none
From Doug E. Fresh to (LL) or DJ (Run)
They say hammer how you do it? I got it like that
My posse's ever rollin', We keep it in tact
Just PUT on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin', And you know I get it started

Let's get it started!

[Verse 3]
Now, a lot of b-boys make em dance, Yo they fakin the beat
They hip hop on the outside put rock underneath
Before the show gets started, They shakin they boots
My posse in the end cold displayin the troops
Like a trooper, I'm down cold hooked on the drugs
808 SP12'Sare expirin africans
Just put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded

Let's get it started!
Let's get it started!
Let's get it started!

[Verse 4]
They said it couldn't happen, that rap wouldn't last
The beat is in effect like the oil in your gas
Cause it's makin lots of money from top to bottom
Whatever in effect, Yo, B-boys have got em
Nobody knows how a rapper really feels
A mind full of rhymes, and a tongue of steel
Just put on the hammer, and you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, and you know I get it started

And on my knees every night,you know I pray

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

(That's word, we pray)
And on my knees every night I'm still gonna pray

[Chorus

[Verse 3]
Time and time and time and time again
(That's word, we pray)

These people wouldn't let me in
(That's word, we pray)
I tried and tried and tried and tried to make a way
(That's word, we pray)
But nothing happened till that day I prayed

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Children dying, oh so fast from this or that
(That's word, we pray)
Needing that money
Smoking that dope and doing that crack

What's it all about?

[Chorus]

That's word, we pray (x3)

And you're good to go

[Verse 6]

[Verse 7]
We're sending this one out to the Lord
(That's word, we pray)
And we thank you and we know we need to pray

And once again we want
To say "thank you" to the Lord with all our love

Chorus (4x):
Pumps and a bump, Pumps and a bump, we like the girls with the Pumps and a bump!

Verse 1:
Just when I thought could I hit another one
So up jumps see me with the pumps and a bump
All stiggitty stiggity curves, getting on my good nerves
Looking like ice cream ready to be served
Stretch, bend it, can I get in it
If you wanna kick it with a G baby here's me
Cause I come equipped, I'm a pimp, slippity slip, out your clothes and take a trip

Chorus(4x)

Pumps and a bump, now many say a big butt
But if you're hip you know that it's a phone crud
It's making the brothers go crazy in the 2-G
Shake like a bottle girl fine as wine G
So when I here I got a step (to a fine thing)
Never been a coward (cause it's a eastside thing)
Just step right up to the girl with the big butt
Tell her what's up you got the pumps and a bump

Bridge:
Men: Aaalll
That we waant
For the rest of our life, is a girl thick and tight
Ladies! Aaall
That we waant
Is man who is right, who can hit it all night!

We gotta bump the pumps!

Chorus(4x)

I don't like 'em figgity fat! (No!)
I like 'em stiggity stacked (Yeah!)
You wiggity wiggity wack if you ain't got biggity back (Awwww!)
Now when you see the rump shaking on the dance floor
You following with your eyes and get hypnotized
But a fella like me will dance up to some chopping and chewing
Keep em bottling you know I keep 'em bobbing
I put my fingerprints all over that rump
I'm guilty as hell but I love the pumps and the bump! (Ow!)

Chorus (4x)

A brand new cut for the hammer to burn up
Suckers gettin mad cause over 20 million sold
And now they try to diss cause they can't get gold
I was born in a hole, [Yo!], Now I'm in Control [Yo!]
Bank boy deep is the way we roll [We roll!]

Straight from high street, Raised by the o.g.'s
Never slanged keys, But quick to drop them b's
Put 'em in the trunk and that ain't no front
Cause east oaktown didn't raise no punk
So sit up, Get up, Girls they get lit up
Check it!, Hammer came with the unexpected, I wrecked it
Quik, I gets mad wicked, I didn't check the rhyme cause Q-Tip couldn't kick it
And that punk Redman, I hit you with the back son
Talk is cheap, It's time time for some action
Gonna make you eat every word that you said
And a trick like you would end up dead, Red
But another talk about the moms and the pops
And when the joking stops, I'mma knock off ya block
And watch ya body drop the ya album straight flopped, Fool, Fool

Know you out there somewhere right now writing rhymes man, laying tracks
Straight love, you know what I'm saying always man
We had never forgot about 2Pac, you know, that's our boy till the end

From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac
From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh, pimp game impecable
Work game incredible (how many songs did he do)
Nine songs a day, no less than four
A rap legend, an icon, a reptible
Last time I seen him was at my Rapper's Ball video
Pac you'll be proud of me pimpin', I'm doing my best
Not only the Bay, but I'm holding down the West
And I just wanna thank Afeni (why)
For birthing 2Pac Shakur, the greatest rapper in history

[Verse 2: MC Hammer]
I'm glad we had a chance, to say goodbye
I shed so many tears and you changed my life
California Love baby ride or die
I can hear you, right now, Pac yelling West Side
And West it is, we got the world going dumb
We gone make 'em understand Pac where we coming from
Don't you worry homie, rest in peace
We appreciate your love, let your soul run free

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Look into the hearts of men, every pumping valve
Man I wish we had 2Pacalypse now
Like you, I wanna make the whole world love me
You let me know, only God can judge me
I got tears in my eyes as I write this verse
The whole Bay know you were hyphy first
You've been gone, we gon stand strong
Immortalized, the legend lives on

[Chorus: Mike Marshall]
Do you hear the people sing, singing the songs that's in their veins
It's the music of a people who have smiled and found the pain
With the beating of your heart, there goes the beating of the drums
Know the song continues on when tomorrow comes

[Verse 4: Mistah Fab]
This is for the great Amaru
God knew, that you, would ride through the ghettos of the world and provide food
For hopeless youth, dope feinds with dope to use
The way that you spoke your views gave hope to dudes
2Pac, the legendary Shakur
Makaveli the Don, a prophet I'm sure
And '96 man it dont seem like it's been
I can picture you rolling up in your 500 Benz

[Verse 5: Mac Mall]
You gave me love on the ghetto scene
Put me on a million TV screens, with you
I remember drinking liqour at century clubs
Watching superstars sworn over Thug Life
You took a youngin from the Crest Side world wide
Real thizzness, I was family when you died
I'm a real outlaw and I'mma ride til the end of time
And when I see you on the other side
I crack the cap on the Henny
And Big Back, would I lie?

[Verse 6: Band-Aide of Dem Hoodstarz]
All eyes on me, dear mama, its me against the world
You know I get around like your brendas little girl
Blast me, no im not telling you the blasphemy
Pac was a [?], his death was a tragedy

[Verse 7: Scoot of Dem Hoodstarz]
Come with me, hail mary to the soldiers
Spit at the cameras, flipping off the rollers
I swear you made a nation full of thugs, put your W's up
And make the West Coast feel like one, rest in peace Pac

[Chorus: Jimmie Reign, Meilani]

[Verse 8: Turf Talk]
(Aye Pac wassup mayne)
Man I've been missing Makaveli since '96
Pac the games change, there are hella wimps
Picrture Me Rolling, one of my favorite songs
Satrin At The World Through My Rearview, Life Goes On
Had dreams of working with you, but it never happened
But I ain't trippin, we'll collaborate some day in heaven
All your albums classics, all of them slapping
Is there a heaven for a G, I know you got it cracking

[Verse 9: Lil Uno of The Pack]
Makaveli, 2Pac, he was a legend
But he in a better place, on earth we call it heaven
'96 is the year that we lost a gift
You gone, but not forgotten, and you always will be missed

[Verse 10: Lil B of The Pack]
Man, Pac, we love you, ain't nobody above you
You music touched us, and the people we buzzing
It's all about Pac, yeah the angel with the broken wings
Rose from concrete, he's still here is what it seems

[Verse 11: Young L of The Pack]
Stand troops, recognize the truth
Here lies the dude who lived rough and died for you
Took slugs and spilt his blood to lace the youth
And told young niggas to get up and face the blues
Cause it's a thugs life, everyday is what we do
Love life, believe and you'll see it through
So to my brother Pac make a place for me with you
I'mma represent you, till I reach the tool

[Chorus: Ray Luv, James "D-Train" Williams, Martha Wash]

[Verse 12: Baby Bash]
He used to clown around, when he came around with the underground
Hit the V-Town with Kyrie on some thunder pounds
Even directed the video (Mac Mall)
He was on some major shit way back then but we didn't know
How a genius get to work, on the herb and the purp
Probably looking down, smiling now on some purp
He had love for us Mexicans
Loves to see young playas stacking Benjamins

[Verse 13: Nump Trump]
I wake up and blaze one for Pac every morning
It's Mr. I Got Grapes, picture me rolling
Everybody knows this, or knew what it was
When we found out Pac passed, it was so messed up
We was crushed, couldn't beleive it, Gorilla-Pinos and all
But we still slap your album so the music lives on
When tomorrow comes, we still ride for Makaveli
From the low-lows to scrapers, you smell me

[Verse 14: Shock G]
Pac, he didn't mean to die, he got in over his head
Died for you but wasn't trying to be dead
He went round and round, cause there wasn't nothing better to do
What could be better than dying for you
Split the blunt, put the Hennessey in the cup
Let me see ya, let me see ya toss it up
We all feel 2Pac, now that he's gone
But recognize those alive who sing the same song, c'mon

[Chorus: Kimberlee Payton, Isa S. Chu, Laura Lane, Nancy Zumwalt]U Can't Touch This Lyrics

[Hook]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

[Verse 1]
My, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say "Oh my Lord"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

[Hook]
I told you homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we living and you know (You can't touch this)
Look at my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

[Verse 2]
Fresh new kicks, advance
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling, hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

[Hook]
Yo, I told you (You can't touch this)
Why you standing there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka (You can't touch this)

[Verse 3]
Give me a song, or rhythm
Make 'em sweat, that's what I'm giving 'em
Now, they know
You talking about the Hammer you talking about a show
That's hype, and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
You can't touch this
Break it down! (Music breaks down)

Stop!

Hammer time

Go with the funk, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump
Break it down! (Nice pants, Hammer)

Stop!

Hammer time

Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others making records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer"
And the rest can go and playYo!! Sweetness Lyrics

[Chorus 2X]
YO' SWEET-NESS  - ("Give it to me, give it to me")
IS, MY WEAK-NESS - ("Give it to me, baby" [- Rick James)
Pump it up, pump it up, pump it up, pump it up

[MC Hammer]
Just, just..
Just the way, that you smile
And the things, that you say
Like Eastwood on the movies
Yo, baby, +make my day+

Dial my number, call me up
I go from pitbull to precious pup

[Chrous]

Call my name, I can't explain
Yo' sweetness drive me insane

[Chorus]

[MC Hammer]
Met this girl, get me hype...
Get me hype, get me stupid
Shot with an uzi, by ol' Cupid
Got me goin on and on
Can't stop groanin on my mobile phone
She says hi, I say yo

Just so sweet, you oh so real
I'm GETTIN weak, that's how I FEEL!

[Chorus]

[MC Hammer]
I remember how I met you, girl...
On the night that we first met
That is the way that I forget
We were buggin at a club

Then you looked, and I looked
And there it was, we were HOOKED!
Sweetness on yo' face
That's why my body (SHOOK AND SHOOK)

[Chorus]

[Instrumental break]

"Give it to me baby" [- Rick James

Yo, yo, yo..

From the moment, that I see you

Makes my heart go PITTIN-PATT!

[Chorus]

Bass! How low can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The incredible Public Enemy number one
Five-O said "Freeze!" and I got numb
Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell cause my records they sell
Cause a brother like me said "Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do"
Follow for now, power to the people say
"Make a miracle. D, pump the lyrical"
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again

Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music that the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters now across the country has us up for the war

We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait
Till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they play this

Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My DJ is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B, and L.L. as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
'Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast dose
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to pleed the fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got the Flavor Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah, I'm telling youBreak Em Off Somethin Lyrics

Chorus (8x): (Q-tip)
If you say Hammer Proper
(Hammer)
We about to break em off somethin Proper

Once again it's on!
You brothers tried to diss me
You missed me
Chill G, For real G
Man u nigga's kill me
Tryin to knock me off the top
Yo there's no contest G in the market
Ya'll hata's never ? me
As I deliver, hits too make em quiver
Make em shiver, Q-tip couldn't flow if he was a river
And me, I'm sellin milli like runnin the mill
And like Big Daddy Kane "I Wonder How You Gotta Record Deal"
Well everyday too make hits, you ain't got it
Til this day you never ? never had it
For me I tend to kick it like a partner
And must I remind you I'm the funky headhunter
I understand u bout as man as Rupaul
I come on your block and move you out like a U-Haul
So step right up and be the next contestant
A Tribe Called Quest Is A Bad Investment
I'm breakin em off with somethin proper!

Chorus (4x)

Like Hardaway boy I got skills
Like 7up you never had it never will
You talkin that mess punk
I see that Kriss Kross couldn't make U jump (now they don't want funk)
Your wack album out be doin
They done bullshit u gotta go gotta go
So pick the time and the place if u ever wanna Warren G
Cause you could stay if u was Jodeci (Do u wanna Just Stay!)
And get your sexual protection
Or I'ma have your head in that played out rapper's collection

(2 Bigg MC)
Just like pennies rap Lights Out!
I Advise u keep his name out yo mouth

Chorus (6x)

Like the rest you was tryin to get paid

And with the slangity bees

(MC Hammer)

(2 Bigg MC)
Dis me I'll sit your ass in the tortuary

(Suge Knight)
You all about as real as yo gel fro

(MC Hammer)
