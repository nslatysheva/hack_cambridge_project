REMEMBER WHEN YOU HIT THE BRAKES TOO SOON
20 STITCHES IN A HOSPITAL ROOM
WHEN YOU STARTED CRYING BABY I DID TOO
BUT WHEN THE SUN CAME UP I WAS LOOKING AT YOU
REMEMBER WHEN WE COULDN'T TAKE THE HEAT

BUT THE MONSTERS TURNED OUT TO BE JUST TREES
WHEN THE SUN CAME UP YOU WERE LOOKING AT ME
YOU WERE LOOKING AT ME
YOU WERE LOOKING AT ME OOH
I REMEMBER OH I REMEMBER
