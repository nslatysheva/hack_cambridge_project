IF I COULD RECOLLECT BEFORE MY HOOD DAYS
I SIT AND REMINISCE THINKING OF BLISS AND THE GOOD DAYS
I STOP AND STARE AT THE YOUNGER
MY HEART GOES TO 'EM THEY TESTED WITH STRESS THAT THEY UNDER
AND NOWADAYS THINGS CHANGE
EVERYONE'S ASHAMED OF THE YOUTH CAUSE THE TRUTH LOOK STRANGE
AND FOR ME IT'S REVERSED
WE LEFT 'EM A WORLD THAT'S CURSED AND IT HURTS
CAUSE ANY DAY THEY'LL PUSH THE BUTTON
AND ALL GOOD MEN LIKE MALCOLM X OR BOBBY HUTTON DIED FOR NOTHING
DON'T IT MAKE YOU GET TEARY THE WORLD LOOKS DREARY
WHEN YOU WIPE YOUR EYES SEE IT CLEARLY
THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO FEAR ME
IF YOU TAKE YOUR TIME AND HEAR ME
MAYBE YOU CAN LEARN TO CHEER ME
IT AIN'T ABOUT BLACK OR WHITE CAUSE WE HUMAN
I HOPE WE SEE THE LIGHT BEFORE IT'S RUINED MY GHETTO GOSPEL

TELL ME DO YOU SEE THAT OLD LADY AIN'T IT SAD LIVING OUT OF BAGS
PLUS SHE'S GLAD FOR THE LITTLE THINGS SHE HAS
AND OVER THERE THERE'S A LADY CRACK GOT HER CRAZY
GUESS WHO'S GIVING BIRTH TO A BABY
I DON'T TRIP OR LET IT FADE ME
FROM OUT OF THE FRYIN PAN WE JUMP INTO ANOTHER FORM OF SLAVERY
EVEN NOW I GET DISCOURAGED
WONDER IF THEY TAKE IT ALL BACK WILL I STILL KEEP THE COURAGE
I REFUSE TO BE A ROLE MODEL
I SET GOALS TAKE CONTROL DRINK OUT MY OWN BOTTLES
I MAKE MISTAKES BUT LEARN FROM EVERY ONE
AND WHEN IT'S SAID AND DONE I BET THIS BROTHER BE A BETTER ONE
IF I UPSET YOU DON'T STRESS NEVER FORGET
THAT GOD ISN'T FINISHED WITH ME YET
I FEEL HIS HAND ON MY BRAIN
WHEN I WRITE RHYMES I GO BLIND AND LET THE LORD DO HIS THING
BUT AM I LESS HOLY
CAUSE I CHOSE TO PUFF A BLUNT
AND DRINK A BEER WITH MY HOMIES
BEFORE WE FIND WORLD PEACE
WE GOTTA FIND PEACE AND END THE WAR IN THE STREETS

CHORUS
AND IT SEEMS TO ME YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE
LIKE A CANDLE IN THE WIND
NEVER FADING WITH THE SUNSET
WHEN THE RAIN SET IN
AND YOUR FOOTSTEPS WILL ALWAYS FALL HERE
ALONG ENGLAND'S GREENEST HILLS
YOUR CANDLE'S BURNED OUT LONG BEFORE
YOUR LEGEND EVER WILL
VERSE 2
LOVELINESS WE'VE LOST
THESE EMPTY DAYS WITHOUT YOUR SMILE
THIS TORCH WE'LL ALWAYS CARRY
FOR OUR NATION'S GOLDEN CHILD
AND EVEN THOUGH WE TRY
THE TRUTH BRINGS US TO TEARS
ALL OUR WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS
THE JOY YOU BROUGHT US THROUGH THE YEARS
CHORUS
VERSE 3
GOODBYE ENGLAND'S ROSE
MAY YOU EVER GROW IN OUR HEARTS
YOU WERE THE GRACE THAT PLACED YOURSELVES
WHERE LIVES WERE TORN APART
GOODBYE ENGLAND'S ROSE
FROM A COUNTRY LOST WITHOUT YOUR SOUL
WHO'LL MISS THE WINGS OF YOUR COMPASSION
MORE THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW
CHORUS CANDLE IN THE WIND SINGLE EDIT LYRICS
GOODBYE NORMA JEANE
THOUGH I NEVER KNEW YOU AT ALL
YOU HAD THE GRACE TO HOLD YOURSELF
WHILE THOSE AROUND YOU CRAWLED
THEY CRAWLED OUT OF THE WOODWORK
AND THEY WHISPERED INTO YOUR BRAIN
THEY SET YOU ON THE TREADMILL
AND THEY MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME
AND IT SEEMS TO ME YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE LIKE A CANDLE IN THE WIND
NEVER KNOWING WHO TO CLING TO WHEN THE RAIN SET IN
AND I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW YOU BUT I WAS JUST A KID
YOUR CANDLE BURNED OUT LONG BEFORE YOUR LEGEND EVER DID
LONELINESS WAS TOUGH
THE TOUGHEST ROLE YOU EVER PLAYED
HOLLYWOOD CREATED A SUPERSTAR
AND PAIN WAS THE PRICE YOU PAID
EVEN WHEN YOU DIED
ALL THE PRESS STILL HOUNDED YOU
ALL THE PAPERS HAD TO SAY
WAS THAT MARILYN WAS FOUND IN THE NUDE
AND IT SEEMS TO ME YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE LIKE A CANDLE IN THE WIND
NEVER KNOWING WHO TO CLING TO WHEN THE RAIN SET IN
AND I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW YOU BUT I WAS JUST A KID
YOUR CANDLE BURNED OUT LONG BEFORE YOUR LEGEND EVER DID
GOODBYE NORMA JEAN
THOUGH I NEVER KNEW YOU AT ALL
YOU HAD THE GRACE TO HOLD YOURSELF
WHILE THOSE AROUND YOU CRAWLED
GOODBYE NORMA JEAN
FROM THE YOUNG MAN IN THE TWENTY SECOND ROW
WHO SEES YOU AS SOMETHING MORE THAN SEXUAL
MORE THAN JUST OUR MARILYN MONROE
AND IT SEEMS TO ME YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE LIKE A CANDLE IN THE WIND
NEVER KNOWING WHO TO CLING TO WHEN THE RAIN SET IN
AND I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW YOU BUT I WAS JUST A KID
YOUR CANDLE BURNED OUT LONG BEFORE YOUR LEGEND EVER DID

CHORUS 1
I REMEMBER WHEN ROCK WAS YOUNG
ME AND SUZIE HAD SO MUCH FUN
HOLDING HANDS AND SKIMMING STONES
HAD AN OLD GOLD CHEVY AND A PLACE OF MY OWN
BUT THE BIGGEST KICK I EVER GOT
WAS DOING A THING CALLED THE CROCODILE ROCK
WHILE THE OTHER KIDS WERE ROCKING ROUND THE CLOCK
WE WERE HOPPING AND BOPPING TO THE CROCODILE ROCK
CHORUS 2
WELL CROCODILE ROCKING IS SOMETHING SHOCKING
WHEN YOUR FEET JUST CAN'T KEEP STILL
I NEVER KNEW ME A BETTER TIME AND I GUESS I NEVER WILL
OH LAWDY MAMA THOSE FRIDAY NIGHTS
WHEN SUZIE WORE HER DRESSES TIGHT
AND THE CROCODILE ROCKING WAS OUT OF SIGHT
VERSE 1
BUT THE YEARS WENT BY AND THE ROCK JUST DIED
SUZIE WENT AND LEFT US FOR SOME FOREIGN GUY
LONG NIGHTS CRYING BY THE RECORD MACHINE
DREAMING OF MY CHEVY AND MY OLD BLUE JEANS
BUT THEY'LL NEVER KILL THE THRILLS WE'VE GOT
BURNING UP TO THE CROCODILE ROCK
LEARNING FAST AS THE WEEKS WENT PAST
WE REALLY THOUGHT THE CROCODILE ROCK WOULD LAST

DANIEL IS TRAVELING TONIGHT ON A PLANE
I CAN SEE THE RED TAIL LIGHTS HEADING FOR SPAIN
AND I CAN SEE DANIEL WAVING GOODBYE
OH IT LOOKS LIKE DANIEL MUST BE THE CLOUDS IN MY EYES

AND DANIEL SAYS IT'S THE BEST PLACE THAT HE'S EVER SEEN
HE SHOULD KNOW HE'S BEEN THERE ENOUGH
OH I MISS DANIEL OH I MISS HIM SO MUCH OH

DANIEL MY BROTHER YOU ARE OLDER THAN ME
DO YOU STILL FEEL THE PAIN OF THE SCARS THAT WON'T HEAL
YOUR EYES HAVE DIED BUT YOU SEE MORE THAN I
