BOOK FIRST A JUST MAN
CHAPTER I M
MYRIEL
IN 1815 M
CHARLES FRANCOIS BIENVENU MYRIEL WAS BISHOP OF D HE WAS
AN OLD MAN OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE HE HAD OCCUPIED THE SEE
OF D SINCE 1806
ALTHOUGH THIS DETAIL HAS NO CONNECTION WHATEVER WITH THE REAL SUBSTANCE
OF WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO RELATE IT WILL NOT BE SUPERFLUOUS IF MERELY
FOR THE SAKE OF EXACTNESS IN ALL POINTS TO MENTION HERE THE VARIOUS
RUMORS AND REMARKS WHICH HAD BEEN IN CIRCULATION ABOUT HIM FROM THE VERY
MOMENT WHEN HE ARRIVED IN THE DIOCESE
TRUE OR FALSE THAT WHICH IS SAID
OF MEN OFTEN OCCUPIES AS IMPORTANT A PLACE IN THEIR LIVES AND ABOVE ALL
IN THEIR DESTINIES AS THAT WHICH THEY DO
M
MYRIEL WAS THE SON OF A
COUNCILLOR OF THE PARLIAMENT OF AIX HENCE HE BELONGED TO THE NOBILITY
OF THE BAR
IT WAS SAID THAT HIS FATHER DESTINING HIM TO BE THE HEIR OF
HIS OWN POST HAD MARRIED HIM AT A VERY EARLY AGE EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY
IN ACCORDANCE WITH A CUSTOM WHICH IS RATHER WIDELY PREVALENT IN
PARLIAMENTARY FAMILIES
IN SPITE OF THIS MARRIAGE HOWEVER IT WAS SAID
THAT CHARLES MYRIEL CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF TALK
HE WAS WELL FORMED
THOUGH RATHER SHORT IN STATURE ELEGANT GRACEFUL INTELLIGENT THE
WHOLE OF THE FIRST PORTION OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN DEVOTED TO THE WORLD AND
TO GALLANTRY
THE REVOLUTION CAME EVENTS SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER WITH PRECIPITATION THE
PARLIAMENTARY FAMILIES DECIMATED PURSUED HUNTED DOWN WERE DISPERSED
M
CHARLES MYRIEL EMIGRATED TO ITALY AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE
REVOLUTION
THERE HIS WIFE DIED OF A MALADY OF THE CHEST FROM WHICH SHE
HAD LONG SUFFERED
HE HAD NO CHILDREN
WHAT TOOK PLACE NEXT IN THE FATE
OF M
MYRIEL THE RUIN OF THE FRENCH SOCIETY OF THE OLDEN DAYS THE FALL
OF HIS OWN FAMILY THE TRAGIC SPECTACLES OF '93 WHICH WERE PERHAPS
EVEN MORE ALARMING TO THE EMIGRANTS WHO VIEWED THEM FROM A DISTANCE
WITH THE MAGNIFYING POWERS OF TERROR DID THESE CAUSE THE IDEAS OF
RENUNCIATION AND SOLITUDE TO GERMINATE IN HIM WAS HE IN THE MIDST OF
THESE DISTRACTIONS THESE AFFECTIONS WHICH ABSORBED HIS LIFE SUDDENLY
SMITTEN WITH ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS AND TERRIBLE BLOWS WHICH SOMETIMES
OVERWHELM BY STRIKING TO HIS HEART A MAN WHOM PUBLIC CATASTROPHES
WOULD NOT SHAKE BY STRIKING AT HIS EXISTENCE AND HIS FORTUNE NO ONE
COULD HAVE TOLD ALL THAT WAS KNOWN WAS THAT WHEN HE RETURNED FROM
ITALY HE WAS A PRIEST
IN 1804 M
MYRIEL WAS THE CURE OF B BRIGNOLLES
HE WAS ALREADY
ADVANCED IN YEARS AND LIVED IN A VERY RETIRED MANNER
ABOUT THE EPOCH OF THE CORONATION SOME PETTY AFFAIR CONNECTED WITH
HIS CURACY JUST WHAT IS NOT PRECISELY KNOWN TOOK HIM TO PARIS
AMONG OTHER POWERFUL PERSONS TO WHOM HE WENT TO SOLICIT AID FOR HIS
PARISHIONERS WAS M
LE CARDINAL FESCH
ONE DAY WHEN THE EMPEROR
HAD COME TO VISIT HIS UNCLE THE WORTHY CURE WHO WAS WAITING IN THE
ANTEROOM FOUND HIMSELF PRESENT WHEN HIS MAJESTY PASSED
NAPOLEON
ON FINDING HIMSELF OBSERVED WITH A CERTAIN CURIOSITY BY THIS OLD MAN
TURNED ROUND AND SAID ABRUPTLY
WHO IS THIS GOOD MAN WHO IS STARING AT ME
SIRE SAID M
MYRIEL YOU ARE LOOKING AT A GOOD MAN AND I AT A GREAT
MAN
EACH OF US CAN PROFIT BY IT
THAT VERY EVENING THE EMPEROR ASKED THE CARDINAL THE NAME OF THE CURE
AND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS M
MYRIEL WAS UTTERLY ASTONISHED TO LEARN THAT
HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED BISHOP OF D
WHAT TRUTH WAS THERE AFTER ALL IN THE STORIES WHICH WERE INVENTED AS
TO THE EARLY PORTION OF M
MYRIEL'S LIFE NO ONE KNEW
VERY FEW FAMILIES
HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE MYRIEL FAMILY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
M
MYRIEL HAD TO UNDERGO THE FATE OF EVERY NEWCOMER IN A LITTLE TOWN
WHERE THERE ARE MANY MOUTHS WHICH TALK AND VERY FEW HEADS WHICH THINK
HE WAS OBLIGED TO UNDERGO IT ALTHOUGH HE WAS A BISHOP AND BECAUSE
HE WAS A BISHOP
BUT AFTER ALL THE RUMORS WITH WHICH HIS NAME
WAS CONNECTED WERE RUMORS ONLY NOISE SAYINGS WORDS LESS THAN
WORDS PALABRES AS THE ENERGETIC LANGUAGE OF THE SOUTH EXPRESSES IT
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE AFTER NINE YEARS OF EPISCOPAL POWER AND OF
RESIDENCE IN D ALL THE STORIES AND SUBJECTS OF CONVERSATION WHICH
ENGROSS PETTY TOWNS AND PETTY PEOPLE AT THE OUTSET HAD FALLEN INTO
PROFOUND OBLIVION
NO ONE WOULD HAVE DARED TO MENTION THEM NO ONE WOULD
HAVE DARED TO RECALL THEM
M
MYRIEL HAD ARRIVED AT D ACCOMPANIED BY AN ELDERLY SPINSTER
MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE WHO WAS HIS SISTER AND TEN YEARS HIS JUNIOR
THEIR ONLY DOMESTIC WAS A FEMALE SERVANT OF THE SAME AGE AS MADEMOISELLE
BAPTISTINE AND NAMED MADAME MAGLOIRE WHO AFTER HAVING BEEN THE
SERVANT OF M
LE CURE NOW ASSUMED THE DOUBLE TITLE OF MAID TO
MADEMOISELLE AND HOUSEKEEPER TO MONSEIGNEUR
MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE WAS A LONG PALE THIN GENTLE CREATURE SHE
REALIZED THE IDEAL EXPRESSED BY THE WORD RESPECTABLE FOR IT SEEMS
THAT A WOMAN MUST NEEDS BE A MOTHER IN ORDER TO BE VENERABLE
SHE
HAD NEVER BEEN PRETTY HER WHOLE LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT A
SUCCESSION OF HOLY DEEDS HAD FINALLY CONFERRED UPON HER A SORT OF
PALLOR AND TRANSPARENCY AND AS SHE ADVANCED IN YEARS SHE HAD ACQUIRED
WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE BEAUTY OF GOODNESS
WHAT HAD BEEN LEANNESS IN
HER YOUTH HAD BECOME TRANSPARENCY IN HER MATURITY AND THIS DIAPHANEITY
ALLOWED THE ANGEL TO BE SEEN
SHE WAS A SOUL RATHER THAN A VIRGIN
HER
PERSON SEEMED MADE OF A SHADOW THERE WAS HARDLY SUFFICIENT BODY TO
PROVIDE FOR SEX A LITTLE MATTER ENCLOSING A LIGHT LARGE EYES FOREVER
DROOPING A MERE PRETEXT FOR A SOUL'S REMAINING ON THE EARTH
MADAME MAGLOIRE WAS A LITTLE FAT WHITE OLD WOMAN CORPULENT AND
BUSTLING ALWAYS OUT OF BREATH IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE OF HER
ACTIVITY AND IN THE NEXT BECAUSE OF HER ASTHMA
ON HIS ARRIVAL M
MYRIEL WAS INSTALLED IN THE EPISCOPAL PALACE WITH
THE HONORS REQUIRED BY THE IMPERIAL DECREES WHICH CLASS A BISHOP
IMMEDIATELY AFTER A MAJOR GENERAL
THE MAYOR AND THE PRESIDENT PAID THE
FIRST CALL ON HIM AND HE IN TURN PAID THE FIRST CALL ON THE GENERAL
AND THE PREFECT
THE INSTALLATION OVER THE TOWN WAITED TO SEE ITS BISHOP AT WORK

THE HOSPITAL WAS A LOW AND NARROW BUILDING OF A SINGLE STORY WITH A
SMALL GARDEN
THREE DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL THE BISHOP VISITED THE HOSPITAL
THE VISIT
ENDED HE HAD THE DIRECTOR REQUESTED TO BE SO GOOD AS TO COME TO HIS
HOUSE
MONSIEUR THE DIRECTOR OF THE HOSPITAL SAID HE TO HIM HOW MANY SICK
PEOPLE HAVE YOU AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
TWENTY SIX MONSEIGNEUR
THAT WAS THE NUMBER WHICH I COUNTED SAID THE BISHOP
THE BEDS PURSUED THE DIRECTOR ARE VERY MUCH CROWDED AGAINST EACH
OTHER
THAT IS WHAT I OBSERVED
THE HALLS ARE NOTHING BUT ROOMS AND IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE AIR
CAN BE CHANGED IN THEM
SO IT SEEMS TO ME
AND THEN WHEN THERE IS A RAY OF SUN THE GARDEN IS VERY SMALL FOR THE
CONVALESCENTS
THAT WAS WHAT I SAID TO MYSELF
IN CASE OF EPIDEMICS WE HAVE HAD THE TYPHUS FEVER THIS YEAR WE
HAD THE SWEATING SICKNESS TWO YEARS AGO AND A HUNDRED PATIENTS AT
TIMES WE KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO
THAT IS THE THOUGHT WHICH OCCURRED TO ME
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE DIRECTOR
ONE MUST RESIGN
ONE'S SELF
THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE IN THE GALLERY DINING ROOM ON THE
GROUND FLOOR
THE BISHOP REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT THEN HE TURNED ABRUPTLY TO THE
DIRECTOR OF THE HOSPITAL
MONSIEUR SAID HE HOW MANY BEDS DO YOU THINK THIS HALL ALONE WOULD
HOLD
MONSEIGNEUR'S DINING ROOM EXCLAIMED THE STUPEFIED DIRECTOR
THE BISHOP CAST A GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT AND SEEMED TO BE TAKING
MEASURES AND CALCULATIONS WITH HIS EYES
IT WOULD HOLD FULL TWENTY BEDS SAID HE AS THOUGH SPEAKING TO
HIMSELF
THEN RAISING HIS VOICE
HOLD MONSIEUR THE DIRECTOR OF THE HOSPITAL I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING
THERE IS EVIDENTLY A MISTAKE HERE
THERE ARE THIRTY SIX OF YOU IN FIVE
OR SIX SMALL ROOMS
THERE ARE THREE OF US HERE AND WE HAVE ROOM FOR
SIXTY
THERE IS SOME MISTAKE I TELL YOU YOU HAVE MY HOUSE AND I HAVE
YOURS
GIVE ME BACK MY HOUSE YOU ARE AT HOME HERE
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE THIRTY SIX PATIENTS WERE INSTALLED IN THE
BISHOP'S PALACE AND THE BISHOP WAS SETTLED IN THE HOSPITAL
M
MYRIEL HAD NO PROPERTY HIS FAMILY HAVING BEEN RUINED BY THE
REVOLUTION
HIS SISTER WAS IN RECEIPT OF A YEARLY INCOME OF FIVE HUNDRED
FRANCS WHICH SUFFICED FOR HER PERSONAL WANTS AT THE VICARAGE
M
MYRIEL
RECEIVED FROM THE STATE IN HIS QUALITY OF BISHOP A SALARY OF FIFTEEN
THOUSAND FRANCS
ON THE VERY DAY WHEN HE TOOK UP HIS ABODE IN THE
HOSPITAL M
MYRIEL SETTLED ON THE DISPOSITION OF THIS SUM ONCE FOR
ALL IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER

M
MYRIEL MADE NO CHANGE IN THIS ARRANGEMENT DURING THE ENTIRE PERIOD
THAT HE OCCUPIED THE SEE OF D AS HAS BEEN SEEN HE CALLED IT
REGULATING HIS HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES
THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS ACCEPTED WITH ABSOLUTE SUBMISSION BY MADEMOISELLE
BAPTISTINE
THIS HOLY WOMAN REGARDED MONSEIGNEUR OF D AS AT ONE AND
THE SAME TIME HER BROTHER AND HER BISHOP HER FRIEND ACCORDING TO THE
FLESH AND HER SUPERIOR ACCORDING TO THE CHURCH
SHE SIMPLY LOVED AND
VENERATED HIM
WHEN HE SPOKE SHE BOWED WHEN HE ACTED SHE YIELDED HER
ADHERENCE
THEIR ONLY SERVANT MADAME MAGLOIRE GRUMBLED A LITTLE
IT
WILL BE OBSERVED THAT MONSIEUR THE BISHOP HAD RESERVED FOR HIMSELF
ONLY ONE THOUSAND LIVRES WHICH ADDED TO THE PENSION OF MADEMOISELLE
BAPTISTINE MADE FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS A YEAR
ON THESE FIFTEEN HUNDRED
FRANCS THESE TWO OLD WOMEN AND THE OLD MAN SUBSISTED
AND WHEN A VILLAGE CURATE CAME TO D THE BISHOP STILL FOUND MEANS TO
ENTERTAIN HIM THANKS TO THE SEVERE ECONOMY OF MADAME MAGLOIRE AND TO
THE INTELLIGENT ADMINISTRATION OF MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE
ONE DAY AFTER HE HAD BEEN IN D ABOUT THREE MONTHS THE BISHOP
SAID
AND STILL I AM QUITE CRAMPED WITH IT ALL
I SHOULD THINK SO EXCLAIMED MADAME MAGLOIRE
MONSEIGNEUR HAS NOT
EVEN CLAIMED THE ALLOWANCE WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OWES HIM FOR THE EXPENSE
OF HIS CARRIAGE IN TOWN AND FOR HIS JOURNEYS ABOUT THE DIOCESE
IT WAS
CUSTOMARY FOR BISHOPS IN FORMER DAYS
HOLD CRIED THE BISHOP YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT MADAME MAGLOIRE
AND HE MADE HIS DEMAND
SOME TIME AFTERWARDS THE GENERAL COUNCIL TOOK THIS DEMAND UNDER
CONSIDERATION AND VOTED HIM AN ANNUAL SUM OF THREE THOUSAND FRANCS
UNDER THIS HEADING ALLOWANCE TO M
THE BISHOP FOR EXPENSES OF CARRIAGE
EXPENSES OF POSTING AND EXPENSES OF PASTORAL VISITS
THIS PROVOKED A GREAT OUTCRY AMONG THE LOCAL BURGESSES AND A SENATOR
OF THE EMPIRE A FORMER MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF THE FIVE HUNDRED
WHICH FAVORED THE 18 BRUMAIRE AND WHO WAS PROVIDED WITH A MAGNIFICENT
SENATORIAL OFFICE IN THE VICINITY OF THE TOWN OF D WROTE TO M
BIGOT DE PREAMENEU THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORSHIP A VERY ANGRY AND
CONFIDENTIAL NOTE ON THE SUBJECT FROM WHICH WE EXTRACT THESE AUTHENTIC
LINES
EXPENSES OF CARRIAGE WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT IN A TOWN OF LESS THAN
FOUR THOUSAND INHABITANTS EXPENSES OF JOURNEYS WHAT IS THE USE
OF THESE TRIPS IN THE FIRST PLACE NEXT HOW CAN THE POSTING BE
ACCOMPLISHED IN THESE MOUNTAINOUS PARTS THERE ARE NO ROADS
NO ONE
TRAVELS OTHERWISE THAN ON HORSEBACK
EVEN THE BRIDGE BETWEEN DURANCE AND
CHATEAU ARNOUX CAN BARELY SUPPORT OX TEAMS
THESE PRIESTS ARE ALL THUS
GREEDY AND AVARICIOUS
THIS MAN PLAYED THE GOOD PRIEST WHEN HE
FIRST CAME
NOW HE DOES LIKE THE REST HE MUST HAVE A CARRIAGE AND A
POSTING CHAISE HE MUST HAVE LUXURIES LIKE THE BISHOPS OF THE OLDEN
DAYS
OH ALL THIS PRIESTHOOD THINGS WILL NOT GO WELL M
LE COMTE
UNTIL THE EMPEROR HAS FREED US FROM THESE BLACK CAPPED RASCALS
DOWN
WITH THE POPE MATTERS WERE GETTING EMBROILED WITH ROME FOR MY PART
I AM FOR CAESAR ALONE ETC ETC
ON THE OTHER HAND THIS AFFAIR AFFORDED GREAT DELIGHT TO MADAME
MAGLOIRE
GOOD SAID SHE TO MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE MONSEIGNEUR
BEGAN WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT HE HAS HAD TO WIND UP WITH HIMSELF AFTER
ALL
HE HAS REGULATED ALL HIS CHARITIES
NOW HERE ARE THREE THOUSAND
FRANCS FOR US AT LAST
THAT SAME EVENING THE BISHOP WROTE OUT AND HANDED TO HIS SISTER A
MEMORANDUM CONCEIVED IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS
EXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT
FOR FURNISHING MEAT SOUP TO THE PATIENTS IN THE HOSPITAL
1 500 LIVRES
FOR THE MATERNITY CHARITABLE SOCIETY OF AIX
250
FOR THE MATERNITY CHARITABLE SOCIETY OF DRAGUIGNAN
250
FOR FOUNDLINGS
500
FOR ORPHANS
500
TOTAL
3 000
SUCH WAS M
MYRIEL'S BUDGET
AS FOR THE CHANCE EPISCOPAL PERQUISITES THE FEES FOR MARRIAGE BANS
DISPENSATIONS PRIVATE BAPTISMS SERMONS BENEDICTIONS OF CHURCHES OR
CHAPELS MARRIAGES ETC THE BISHOP LEVIED THEM ON THE WEALTHY WITH ALL
THE MORE ASPERITY SINCE HE BESTOWED THEM ON THE NEEDY
AFTER A TIME OFFERINGS OF MONEY FLOWED IN
THOSE WHO HAD AND THOSE WHO
LACKED KNOCKED AT M
MYRIEL'S DOOR THE LATTER IN SEARCH OF THE ALMS
WHICH THE FORMER CAME TO DEPOSIT
IN LESS THAN A YEAR THE BISHOP HAD
BECOME THE TREASURER OF ALL BENEVOLENCE AND THE CASHIER OF ALL THOSE
IN DISTRESS
CONSIDERABLE SUMS OF MONEY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS BUT
NOTHING COULD INDUCE HIM TO MAKE ANY CHANGE WHATEVER IN HIS MODE OF
LIFE OR ADD ANYTHING SUPERFLUOUS TO HIS BARE NECESSITIES
FAR FROM IT
AS THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WRETCHEDNESS BELOW THAN THERE
IS BROTHERHOOD ABOVE ALL WAS GIVEN AWAY SO TO SPEAK BEFORE IT WAS
RECEIVED
IT WAS LIKE WATER ON DRY SOIL NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY HE
RECEIVED HE NEVER HAD ANY
THEN HE STRIPPED HIMSELF
THE USAGE BEING THAT BISHOPS SHALL ANNOUNCE THEIR BAPTISMAL NAMES AT THE
HEAD OF THEIR CHARGES AND THEIR PASTORAL LETTERS THE POOR PEOPLE OF THE
COUNTRY SIDE HAD SELECTED WITH A SORT OF AFFECTIONATE INSTINCT AMONG
THE NAMES AND PRENOMENS OF THEIR BISHOP THAT WHICH HAD A MEANING FOR
THEM AND THEY NEVER CALLED HIM ANYTHING EXCEPT MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU
WELCOME
WE WILL FOLLOW THEIR EXAMPLE AND WILL ALSO CALL HIM THUS
WHEN WE HAVE OCCASION TO NAME HIM
MOREOVER THIS APPELLATION PLEASED
HIM
I LIKE THAT NAME SAID HE
BIENVENU MAKES UP FOR THE MONSEIGNEUR
WE DO NOT CLAIM THAT THE PORTRAIT HEREWITH PRESENTED IS PROBABLE WE
CONFINE OURSELVES TO STATING THAT IT RESEMBLES THE ORIGINAL
CHAPTER III A HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP
THE BISHOP DID NOT OMIT HIS PASTORAL VISITS BECAUSE HE HAD CONVERTED HIS
CARRIAGE INTO ALMS
THE DIOCESE OF D IS A FATIGUING ONE
THERE ARE
VERY FEW PLAINS AND A GREAT MANY MOUNTAINS HARDLY ANY ROADS AS WE HAVE
JUST SEEN THIRTY TWO CURACIES FORTY ONE VICARSHIPS AND TWO HUNDRED
AND EIGHTY FIVE AUXILIARY CHAPELS
TO VISIT ALL THESE IS QUITE A TASK
THE BISHOP MANAGED TO DO IT
HE WENT ON FOOT WHEN IT WAS IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD IN A TILTED SPRING CART WHEN IT WAS ON THE PLAIN AND ON
A DONKEY IN THE MOUNTAINS
THE TWO OLD WOMEN ACCOMPANIED HIM
WHEN THE
TRIP WAS TOO HARD FOR THEM HE WENT ALONE
ONE DAY HE ARRIVED AT SENEZ WHICH IS AN ANCIENT EPISCOPAL CITY
HE WAS
MOUNTED ON AN ASS
HIS PURSE WHICH WAS VERY DRY AT THAT MOMENT DID NOT
PERMIT HIM ANY OTHER EQUIPAGE
THE MAYOR OF THE TOWN CAME TO RECEIVE
HIM AT THE GATE OF THE TOWN AND WATCHED HIM DISMOUNT FROM HIS ASS
WITH SCANDALIZED EYES
SOME OF THE CITIZENS WERE LAUGHING AROUND HIM
MONSIEUR THE MAYOR SAID THE BISHOP AND MESSIEURS CITIZENS I
PERCEIVE THAT I SHOCK YOU
YOU THINK IT VERY ARROGANT IN A POOR PRIEST
TO RIDE AN ANIMAL WHICH WAS USED BY JESUS CHRIST
I HAVE DONE SO FROM
NECESSITY I ASSURE YOU AND NOT FROM VANITY
IN THE COURSE OF THESE TRIPS HE WAS KIND AND INDULGENT AND TALKED
RATHER THAN PREACHED
HE NEVER WENT FAR IN SEARCH OF HIS ARGUMENTS AND
HIS EXAMPLES
HE QUOTED TO THE INHABITANTS OF ONE DISTRICT THE EXAMPLE
OF A NEIGHBORING DISTRICT
IN THE CANTONS WHERE THEY WERE HARSH TO THE
POOR HE SAID LOOK AT THE PEOPLE OF BRIANCON THEY HAVE CONFERRED ON
THE POOR ON WIDOWS AND ORPHANS THE RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR MEADOWS MOWN
THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE OF EVERY ONE ELSE
THEY REBUILD THEIR HOUSES FOR
THEM GRATUITOUSLY WHEN THEY ARE RUINED
THEREFORE IT IS A COUNTRY WHICH
IS BLESSED BY GOD
FOR A WHOLE CENTURY THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SINGLE
MURDERER AMONG THEM
IN VILLAGES WHICH WERE GREEDY FOR PROFIT AND HARVEST HE SAID LOOK AT
THE PEOPLE OF EMBRUN IF AT THE HARVEST SEASON THE FATHER OF A FAMILY
HAS HIS SON AWAY ON SERVICE IN THE ARMY AND HIS DAUGHTERS AT SERVICE IN
THE TOWN AND IF HE IS ILL AND INCAPACITATED THE CURE RECOMMENDS HIM TO
THE PRAYERS OF THE CONGREGATION AND ON SUNDAY AFTER THE MASS ALL THE
INHABITANTS OF THE VILLAGE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN GO TO THE POOR
MAN'S FIELD AND DO HIS HARVESTING FOR HIM AND CARRY HIS STRAW AND HIS
GRAIN TO HIS GRANARY TO FAMILIES DIVIDED BY QUESTIONS OF MONEY AND
INHERITANCE HE SAID LOOK AT THE MOUNTAINEERS OF DEVOLNY A COUNTRY SO
WILD THAT THE NIGHTINGALE IS NOT HEARD THERE ONCE IN FIFTY YEARS
WELL WHEN THE FATHER OF A FAMILY DIES THE BOYS GO OFF TO SEEK THEIR
FORTUNES LEAVING THE PROPERTY TO THE GIRLS SO THAT THEY MAY FIND
HUSBANDS TO THE CANTONS WHICH HAD A TASTE FOR LAWSUITS AND WHERE THE
FARMERS RUINED THEMSELVES IN STAMPED PAPER HE SAID LOOK AT THOSE GOOD
PEASANTS IN THE VALLEY OF QUEYRAS THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND SOULS OF
THEM
MON DIEU IT IS LIKE A LITTLE REPUBLIC
NEITHER JUDGE NOR BAILIFF
IS KNOWN THERE
THE MAYOR DOES EVERYTHING
HE ALLOTS THE IMPOSTS
TAXES EACH PERSON CONSCIENTIOUSLY JUDGES QUARRELS FOR NOTHING DIVIDES
INHERITANCES WITHOUT CHARGE PRONOUNCES SENTENCES GRATUITOUSLY AND HE
IS OBEYED BECAUSE HE IS A JUST MAN AMONG SIMPLE MEN TO VILLAGES WHERE
HE FOUND NO SCHOOLMASTER HE QUOTED ONCE MORE THE PEOPLE OF QUEYRAS DO
YOU KNOW HOW THEY MANAGE HE SAID
SINCE A LITTLE COUNTRY OF A
DOZEN OR FIFTEEN HEARTHS CANNOT ALWAYS SUPPORT A TEACHER THEY HAVE
SCHOOL MASTERS WHO ARE PAID BY THE WHOLE VALLEY WHO MAKE THE ROUND
OF THE VILLAGES SPENDING A WEEK IN THIS ONE TEN DAYS IN THAT AND
INSTRUCT THEM
THESE TEACHERS GO TO THE FAIRS
I HAVE SEEN THEM THERE
THEY ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THE QUILL PENS WHICH THEY WEAR IN THE CORD
OF THEIR HAT
THOSE WHO TEACH READING ONLY HAVE ONE PEN THOSE WHO TEACH
READING AND RECKONING HAVE TWO PENS THOSE WHO TEACH READING RECKONING
AND LATIN HAVE THREE PENS
BUT WHAT A DISGRACE TO BE IGNORANT DO LIKE
THE PEOPLE OF QUEYRAS
THUS HE DISCOURSED GRAVELY AND PATERNALLY IN DEFAULT OF EXAMPLES HE
INVENTED PARABLES GOING DIRECTLY TO THE POINT WITH FEW PHRASES AND
MANY IMAGES WHICH CHARACTERISTIC FORMED THE REAL ELOQUENCE OF JESUS
CHRIST
AND BEING CONVINCED HIMSELF HE WAS PERSUASIVE
CHAPTER IV WORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS
HIS CONVERSATION WAS GAY AND AFFABLE
HE PUT HIMSELF ON A LEVEL WITH THE
TWO OLD WOMEN WHO HAD PASSED THEIR LIVES BESIDE HIM
WHEN HE LAUGHED
IT WAS THE LAUGH OF A SCHOOLBOY
MADAME MAGLOIRE LIKED TO CALL HIM YOUR
GRACE VOTRE GRANDEUR
ONE DAY HE ROSE FROM HIS ARM CHAIR AND WENT
TO HIS LIBRARY IN SEARCH OF A BOOK
THIS BOOK WAS ON ONE OF THE UPPER
SHELVES
AS THE BISHOP WAS RATHER SHORT OF STATURE HE COULD NOT
REACH IT
MADAME MAGLOIRE SAID HE FETCH ME A CHAIR
MY GREATNESS
GRANDEUR DOES NOT REACH AS FAR AS THAT SHELF
ONE OF HIS DISTANT RELATIVES MADAME LA COMTESSE DE LO RARELY ALLOWED
AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE OF ENUMERATING IN HIS PRESENCE WHAT SHE
DESIGNATED AS THE EXPECTATIONS OF HER THREE SONS
SHE HAD NUMEROUS
RELATIVES WHO WERE VERY OLD AND NEAR TO DEATH AND OF WHOM HER SONS
WERE THE NATURAL HEIRS
THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE WAS TO RECEIVE FROM A
GRAND AUNT A GOOD HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVRES OF INCOME THE SECOND WAS THE
HEIR BY ENTAIL TO THE TITLE OF THE DUKE HIS UNCLE THE ELDEST WAS TO
SUCCEED TO THE PEERAGE OF HIS GRANDFATHER
THE BISHOP WAS ACCUSTOMED TO
LISTEN IN SILENCE TO THESE INNOCENT AND PARDONABLE MATERNAL BOASTS
ON
ONE OCCASION HOWEVER HE APPEARED TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN USUAL
WHILE MADAME DE LO WAS RELATING ONCE AGAIN THE DETAILS OF ALL THESE
INHERITANCES AND ALL THESE EXPECTATIONS SHE INTERRUPTED HERSELF
IMPATIENTLY MON DIEU COUSIN WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT I AM
THINKING REPLIED THE BISHOP OF A SINGULAR REMARK WHICH IS TO BE
FOUND I BELIEVE IN ST
AUGUSTINE 'PLACE YOUR HOPES IN THE MAN FROM
WHOM YOU DO NOT INHERIT
AT ANOTHER TIME ON RECEIVING A NOTIFICATION OF THE DECEASE OF A
GENTLEMAN OF THE COUNTRY SIDE WHEREIN NOT ONLY THE DIGNITIES OF THE
DEAD MAN BUT ALSO THE FEUDAL AND NOBLE QUALIFICATIONS OF ALL HIS
RELATIVES SPREAD OVER AN ENTIRE PAGE WHAT A STOUT BACK DEATH HAS
HE EXCLAIMED
WHAT A STRANGE BURDEN OF TITLES IS CHEERFULLY IMPOSED
ON HIM AND HOW MUCH WIT MUST MEN HAVE IN ORDER THUS TO PRESS THE TOMB
INTO THE SERVICE OF VANITY
HE WAS GIFTED ON OCCASION WITH A GENTLE RAILLERY WHICH ALMOST ALWAYS
CONCEALED A SERIOUS MEANING
IN THE COURSE OF ONE LENT A YOUTHFUL VICAR
CAME TO D AND PREACHED IN THE CATHEDRAL
HE WAS TOLERABLY ELOQUENT
THE SUBJECT OF HIS SERMON WAS CHARITY
HE URGED THE RICH TO GIVE TO THE
POOR IN ORDER TO AVOID HELL WHICH HE DEPICTED IN THE MOST FRIGHTFUL
MANNER OF WHICH HE WAS CAPABLE AND TO WIN PARADISE WHICH HE
REPRESENTED AS CHARMING AND DESIRABLE
AMONG THE AUDIENCE THERE WAS
A WEALTHY RETIRED MERCHANT WHO WAS SOMEWHAT OF A USURER NAMED M
GEBORAND WHO HAD AMASSED TWO MILLIONS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF COARSE
CLOTH SERGES AND WOOLLEN GALLOONS
NEVER IN HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD M
GEBORAND BESTOWED ALMS ON ANY POOR WRETCH
AFTER THE DELIVERY OF THAT
SERMON IT WAS OBSERVED THAT HE GAVE A SOU EVERY SUNDAY TO THE POOR OLD
BEGGAR WOMEN AT THE DOOR OF THE CATHEDRAL
THERE WERE SIX OF THEM TO
SHARE IT
ONE DAY THE BISHOP CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM IN THE ACT OF BESTOWING
THIS CHARITY AND SAID TO HIS SISTER WITH A SMILE THERE IS M
GEBORAND PURCHASING PARADISE FOR A SOU
WHEN IT WAS A QUESTION OF CHARITY HE WAS NOT TO BE REBUFFED EVEN BY
A REFUSAL AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS HE GAVE UTTERANCE TO REMARKS WHICH
INDUCED REFLECTION
ONCE HE WAS BEGGING FOR THE POOR IN A DRAWING ROOM
OF THE TOWN THERE WAS PRESENT THE MARQUIS DE CHAMPTERCIER A WEALTHY
AND AVARICIOUS OLD MAN WHO CONTRIVED TO BE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME
AN ULTRA ROYALIST AND AN ULTRA VOLTAIRIAN
THIS VARIETY OF MAN HAS
ACTUALLY EXISTED
WHEN THE BISHOP CAME TO HIM HE TOUCHED HIS ARM YOU
MUST GIVE ME SOMETHING M
LE MARQUIS THE MARQUIS TURNED ROUND AND
ANSWERED DRYLY I HAVE POOR PEOPLE OF MY OWN MONSEIGNEUR GIVE THEM
TO ME REPLIED THE BISHOP
ONE DAY HE PREACHED THE FOLLOWING SERMON IN THE CATHEDRAL
MY VERY DEAR BRETHREN MY GOOD FRIENDS THERE ARE THIRTEEN HUNDRED
AND TWENTY THOUSAND PEASANTS' DWELLINGS IN FRANCE WHICH HAVE BUT THREE
OPENINGS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND HOVELS WHICH HAVE BUT
TWO OPENINGS THE DOOR AND ONE WINDOW AND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX
THOUSAND CABINS BESIDES WHICH HAVE BUT ONE OPENING THE DOOR
AND THIS
ARISES FROM A THING WHICH IS CALLED THE TAX ON DOORS AND WINDOWS
JUST
PUT POOR FAMILIES OLD WOMEN AND LITTLE CHILDREN IN THOSE BUILDINGS
AND BEHOLD THE FEVERS AND MALADIES WHICH RESULT ALAS GOD GIVES AIR TO
MEN THE LAW SELLS IT TO THEM
I DO NOT BLAME THE LAW BUT I BLESS GOD
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ISERE IN THE VAR IN THE TWO DEPARTMENTS
OF THE ALPES THE HAUTES AND THE BASSES THE PEASANTS HAVE NOT EVEN
WHEELBARROWS THEY TRANSPORT THEIR MANURE ON THE BACKS OF MEN THEY HAVE
NO CANDLES AND THEY BURN RESINOUS STICKS AND BITS OF ROPE DIPPED IN
PITCH
THAT IS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THE HILLY
COUNTRY OF DAUPHINE
THEY MAKE BREAD FOR SIX MONTHS AT ONE TIME THEY
BAKE IT WITH DRIED COW DUNG
IN THE WINTER THEY BREAK THIS BREAD UP WITH
AN AXE AND THEY SOAK IT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN ORDER TO RENDER IT
EATABLE
MY BRETHREN HAVE PITY BEHOLD THE SUFFERING ON ALL SIDES OF
YOU
BORN A PROVENCAL HE EASILY FAMILIARIZED HIMSELF WITH THE DIALECT OF THE
SOUTH
HE SAID EN BE MOUSSU SES SAGE AS IN LOWER LANGUEDOC ONTE
ANARAS PASSA AS IN THE BASSES ALPES PUERTE UN BOUEN MOUTU EMBE UN
BOUEN FROMAGE GRASE AS IN UPPER DAUPHINE
THIS PLEASED THE PEOPLE
EXTREMELY AND CONTRIBUTED NOT A LITTLE TO WIN HIM ACCESS TO ALL
SPIRITS
HE WAS PERFECTLY AT HOME IN THE THATCHED COTTAGE AND IN THE
MOUNTAINS
HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO SAY THE GRANDEST THINGS IN THE MOST
VULGAR OF IDIOMS
AS HE SPOKE ALL TONGUES HE ENTERED INTO ALL HEARTS
MOREOVER HE WAS THE SAME TOWARDS PEOPLE OF THE WORLD AND TOWARDS
THE LOWER CLASSES
HE CONDEMNED NOTHING IN HASTE AND WITHOUT TAKING
CIRCUMSTANCES INTO ACCOUNT
HE SAID EXAMINE THE ROAD OVER WHICH THE
FAULT HAS PASSED
BEING AS HE DESCRIBED HIMSELF WITH A SMILE AN EX SINNER HE HAD NONE
OF THE ASPERITIES OF AUSTERITY AND HE PROFESSED WITH A GOOD DEAL
OF DISTINCTNESS AND WITHOUT THE FROWN OF THE FEROCIOUSLY VIRTUOUS A
DOCTRINE WHICH MAY BE SUMMED UP AS FOLLOWS
MAN HAS UPON HIM HIS FLESH WHICH IS AT ONCE HIS BURDEN AND HIS
TEMPTATION
HE DRAGS IT WITH HIM AND YIELDS TO IT
HE MUST WATCH IT
CHECK IT REPRESS IT AND OBEY IT ONLY AT THE LAST EXTREMITY
THERE MAY
BE SOME FAULT EVEN IN THIS OBEDIENCE BUT THE FAULT THUS COMMITTED IS
VENIAL IT IS A FALL BUT A FALL ON THE KNEES WHICH MAY TERMINATE IN
PRAYER
TO BE A SAINT IS THE EXCEPTION TO BE AN UPRIGHT MAN IS THE RULE
ERR
FALL SIN IF YOU WILL BUT BE UPRIGHT
THE LEAST POSSIBLE SIN IS THE LAW OF MAN
NO SIN AT ALL IS THE DREAM
OF THE ANGEL
ALL WHICH IS TERRESTRIAL IS SUBJECT TO SIN
SIN IS A
GRAVITATION
WHEN HE SAW EVERYONE EXCLAIMING VERY LOUDLY AND GROWING ANGRY VERY
QUICKLY OH OH HE SAID WITH A SMILE TO ALL APPEARANCE THIS IS
A GREAT CRIME WHICH ALL THE WORLD COMMITS
THESE ARE HYPOCRISIES
WHICH HAVE TAKEN FRIGHT AND ARE IN HASTE TO MAKE PROTEST AND TO PUT
THEMSELVES UNDER SHELTER
HE WAS INDULGENT TOWARDS WOMEN AND POOR PEOPLE ON WHOM THE BURDEN OF
HUMAN SOCIETY REST
HE SAID THE FAULTS OF WOMEN OF CHILDREN OF THE
FEEBLE THE INDIGENT AND THE IGNORANT ARE THE FAULT OF THE HUSBANDS
THE FATHERS THE MASTERS THE STRONG THE RICH AND THE WISE
HE SAID MOREOVER TEACH THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT AS MANY THINGS AS
POSSIBLE SOCIETY IS CULPABLE IN THAT IT DOES NOT AFFORD INSTRUCTION
GRATIS IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NIGHT WHICH IT PRODUCES
THIS SOUL
IS FULL OF SHADOW SIN IS THEREIN COMMITTED
THE GUILTY ONE IS NOT THE
PERSON WHO HAS COMMITTED THE SIN BUT THE PERSON WHO HAS CREATED THE
SHADOW
IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD A PECULIAR MANNER OF HIS OWN OF JUDGING
THINGS I SUSPECT THAT HE OBTAINED IT FROM THE GOSPEL
ONE DAY HE HEARD A CRIMINAL CASE WHICH WAS IN PREPARATION AND ON THE
POINT OF TRIAL DISCUSSED IN A DRAWING ROOM
A WRETCHED MAN BEING AT
THE END OF HIS RESOURCES HAD COINED COUNTERFEIT MONEY OUT OF LOVE FOR
A WOMAN AND FOR THE CHILD WHICH HE HAD HAD BY HER
COUNTERFEITING WAS
STILL PUNISHABLE WITH DEATH AT THAT EPOCH
THE WOMAN HAD BEEN ARRESTED
IN THE ACT OF PASSING THE FIRST FALSE PIECE MADE BY THE MAN
SHE WAS
HELD BUT THERE WERE NO PROOFS EXCEPT AGAINST HER
SHE ALONE COULD
ACCUSE HER LOVER AND DESTROY HIM BY HER CONFESSION
SHE DENIED THEY
INSISTED
SHE PERSISTED IN HER DENIAL
THEREUPON AN IDEA OCCURRED TO
THE ATTORNEY FOR THE CROWN
HE INVENTED AN INFIDELITY ON THE PART OF
THE LOVER AND SUCCEEDED BY MEANS OF FRAGMENTS OF LETTERS CUNNINGLY
PRESENTED IN PERSUADING THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN THAT SHE HAD A RIVAL AND
THAT THE MAN WAS DECEIVING HER
THEREUPON EXASPERATED BY JEALOUSY SHE
DENOUNCED HER LOVER CONFESSED ALL PROVED ALL
THE MAN WAS RUINED
HE WAS SHORTLY TO BE TRIED AT AIX WITH HIS
ACCOMPLICE
THEY WERE RELATING THE MATTER AND EACH ONE WAS EXPRESSING
ENTHUSIASM OVER THE CLEVERNESS OF THE MAGISTRATE
BY BRINGING JEALOUSY
INTO PLAY HE HAD CAUSED THE TRUTH TO BURST FORTH IN WRATH HE HAD
EDUCED THE JUSTICE OF REVENGE
THE BISHOP LISTENED TO ALL THIS IN
SILENCE
WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED HE INQUIRED
WHERE ARE THIS MAN AND WOMAN TO BE TRIED
AT THE COURT OF ASSIZES
HE WENT ON AND WHERE WILL THE ADVOCATE OF THE CROWN BE TRIED
A TRAGIC EVENT OCCURRED AT D A MAN WAS CONDEMNED TO DEATH FOR
MURDER
HE WAS A WRETCHED FELLOW NOT EXACTLY EDUCATED NOT EXACTLY
IGNORANT WHO HAD BEEN A MOUNTEBANK AT FAIRS AND A WRITER FOR THE
PUBLIC
THE TOWN TOOK A GREAT INTEREST IN THE TRIAL
ON THE EVE OF THE
DAY FIXED FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE CONDEMNED MAN THE CHAPLAIN OF THE
PRISON FELL ILL
A PRIEST WAS NEEDED TO ATTEND THE CRIMINAL IN HIS
LAST MOMENTS
THEY SENT FOR THE CURE
IT SEEMS THAT HE REFUSED TO COME
SAYING THAT IS NO AFFAIR OF MINE
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT
UNPLEASANT TASK AND WITH THAT MOUNTEBANK I TOO AM ILL AND BESIDES
IT IS NOT MY PLACE THIS REPLY WAS REPORTED TO THE BISHOP WHO SAID
MONSIEUR LE CURE IS RIGHT IT IS NOT HIS PLACE IT IS MINE
HE WENT INSTANTLY TO THE PRISON DESCENDED TO THE CELL OF THE
MOUNTEBANK CALLED HIM BY NAME TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND SPOKE TO
HIM
HE PASSED THE ENTIRE DAY WITH HIM FORGETFUL OF FOOD AND SLEEP
PRAYING TO GOD FOR THE SOUL OF THE CONDEMNED MAN AND PRAYING THE
CONDEMNED MAN FOR HIS OWN
HE TOLD HIM THE BEST TRUTHS WHICH ARE ALSO
THE MOST SIMPLE
HE WAS FATHER BROTHER FRIEND HE WAS BISHOP ONLY TO
BLESS
HE TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING ENCOURAGED AND CONSOLED HIM
THE MAN
WAS ON THE POINT OF DYING IN DESPAIR
DEATH WAS AN ABYSS TO HIM
AS HE
STOOD TREMBLING ON ITS MOURNFUL BRINK HE RECOILED WITH HORROR
HE
WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IGNORANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY INDIFFERENT
HIS
CONDEMNATION WHICH HAD BEEN A PROFOUND SHOCK HAD IN A MANNER BROKEN
THROUGH HERE AND THERE THAT WALL WHICH SEPARATES US FROM THE MYSTERY
OF THINGS AND WHICH WE CALL LIFE
HE GAZED INCESSANTLY BEYOND THIS
WORLD THROUGH THESE FATAL BREACHES AND BEHELD ONLY DARKNESS
THE BISHOP
MADE HIM SEE LIGHT
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN THEY CAME TO FETCH THE UNHAPPY WRETCH THE
BISHOP WAS STILL THERE
HE FOLLOWED HIM AND EXHIBITED HIMSELF TO THE
EYES OF THE CROWD IN HIS PURPLE CAMAIL AND WITH HIS EPISCOPAL CROSS UPON
HIS NECK SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE CRIMINAL BOUND WITH CORDS
HE MOUNTED THE TUMBRIL WITH HIM HE MOUNTED THE SCAFFOLD WITH HIM
THE
SUFFERER WHO HAD BEEN SO GLOOMY AND CAST DOWN ON THE PRECEDING DAY WAS
RADIANT
HE FELT THAT HIS SOUL WAS RECONCILED AND HE HOPED IN GOD
THE
BISHOP EMBRACED HIM AND AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE KNIFE WAS ABOUT TO FALL
HE SAID TO HIM GOD RAISES FROM THE DEAD HIM WHOM MAN SLAYS HE WHOM
HIS BROTHERS HAVE REJECTED FINDS HIS FATHER ONCE MORE
PRAY BELIEVE
ENTER INTO LIFE THE FATHER IS THERE WHEN HE DESCENDED FROM THE
SCAFFOLD THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS LOOK WHICH MADE THE PEOPLE DRAW
ASIDE TO LET HIM PASS
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHICH WAS MOST WORTHY OF
ADMIRATION HIS PALLOR OR HIS SERENITY
ON HIS RETURN TO THE HUMBLE
DWELLING WHICH HE DESIGNATED WITH A SMILE AS HIS PALACE HE SAID TO
HIS SISTER I HAVE JUST OFFICIATED PONTIFICALLY
SINCE THE MOST SUBLIME THINGS ARE OFTEN THOSE WHICH ARE THE LEAST
UNDERSTOOD THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN WHO SAID WHEN COMMENTING ON
THIS CONDUCT OF THE BISHOP IT IS AFFECTATION
THIS HOWEVER WAS A REMARK WHICH WAS CONFINED TO THE DRAWING ROOMS
THE POPULACE WHICH PERCEIVES NO JEST IN HOLY DEEDS WAS TOUCHED AND
ADMIRED HIM
AS FOR THE BISHOP IT WAS A SHOCK TO HIM TO HAVE BEHELD THE GUILLOTINE
AND IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE HE RECOVERED FROM IT
IN FACT WHEN THE SCAFFOLD IS THERE ALL ERECTED AND PREPARED IT HAS
SOMETHING ABOUT IT WHICH PRODUCES HALLUCINATION
ONE MAY FEEL A CERTAIN
INDIFFERENCE TO THE DEATH PENALTY ONE MAY REFRAIN FROM PRONOUNCING UPON
IT FROM SAYING YES OR NO SO LONG AS ONE HAS NOT SEEN A GUILLOTINE WITH
ONE'S OWN EYES BUT IF ONE ENCOUNTERS ONE OF THEM THE SHOCK IS VIOLENT
ONE IS FORCED TO DECIDE AND TO TAKE PART FOR OR AGAINST
SOME ADMIRE
IT LIKE DE MAISTRE OTHERS EXECRATE IT LIKE BECCARIA
THE GUILLOTINE
IS THE CONCRETION OF THE LAW IT IS CALLED VINDICTE IT IS NOT NEUTRAL
AND IT DOES NOT PERMIT YOU TO REMAIN NEUTRAL
HE WHO SEES IT SHIVERS
WITH THE MOST MYSTERIOUS OF SHIVERS
ALL SOCIAL PROBLEMS ERECT THEIR
INTERROGATION POINT AROUND THIS CHOPPING KNIFE
THE SCAFFOLD IS A
VISION
THE SCAFFOLD IS NOT A PIECE OF CARPENTRY THE SCAFFOLD IS NOT
A MACHINE THE SCAFFOLD IS NOT AN INERT BIT OF MECHANISM CONSTRUCTED OF
WOOD IRON AND CORDS
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH IT WERE A BEING POSSESSED OF I KNOW NOT WHAT SOMBRE
INITIATIVE ONE WOULD SAY THAT THIS PIECE OF CARPENTER'S WORK SAW THAT
THIS MACHINE HEARD THAT THIS MECHANISM UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WOOD
THIS IRON AND THESE CORDS WERE POSSESSED OF WILL
IN THE FRIGHTFUL
MEDITATION INTO WHICH ITS PRESENCE CASTS THE SOUL THE SCAFFOLD APPEARS
IN TERRIBLE GUISE AND AS THOUGH TAKING PART IN WHAT IS GOING ON
THE
SCAFFOLD IS THE ACCOMPLICE OF THE EXECUTIONER IT DEVOURS IT EATS
FLESH IT DRINKS BLOOD THE SCAFFOLD IS A SORT OF MONSTER FABRICATED
BY THE JUDGE AND THE CARPENTER A SPECTRE WHICH SEEMS TO LIVE WITH A
HORRIBLE VITALITY COMPOSED OF ALL THE DEATH WHICH IT HAS INFLICTED
THEREFORE THE IMPRESSION WAS TERRIBLE AND PROFOUND ON THE DAY
FOLLOWING THE EXECUTION AND ON MANY SUCCEEDING DAYS THE BISHOP
APPEARED TO BE CRUSHED
THE ALMOST VIOLENT SERENITY OF THE FUNEREAL
MOMENT HAD DISAPPEARED THE PHANTOM OF SOCIAL JUSTICE TORMENTED HIM
HE
WHO GENERALLY RETURNED FROM ALL HIS DEEDS WITH A RADIANT SATISFACTION
SEEMED TO BE REPROACHING HIMSELF
AT TIMES HE TALKED TO HIMSELF AND
STAMMERED LUGUBRIOUS MONOLOGUES IN A LOW VOICE
THIS IS ONE WHICH HIS
SISTER OVERHEARD ONE EVENING AND PRESERVED I DID NOT THINK THAT IT WAS
SO MONSTROUS
IT IS WRONG TO BECOME ABSORBED IN THE DIVINE LAW TO SUCH A
DEGREE AS NOT TO PERCEIVE HUMAN LAW
DEATH BELONGS TO GOD ALONE
BY WHAT
RIGHT DO MEN TOUCH THAT UNKNOWN THING
IN COURSE OF TIME THESE IMPRESSIONS WEAKENED AND PROBABLY VANISHED
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE BISHOP THENCEFORTH AVOIDED
PASSING THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
M
MYRIEL COULD BE SUMMONED AT ANY HOUR TO THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK AND
DYING
HE DID NOT IGNORE THE FACT THAT THEREIN LAY HIS GREATEST DUTY AND
HIS GREATEST LABOR
WIDOWED AND ORPHANED FAMILIES HAD NO NEED TO SUMMON
HIM HE CAME OF HIS OWN ACCORD
HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO SIT DOWN AND HOLD
HIS PEACE FOR LONG HOURS BESIDE THE MAN WHO HAD LOST THE WIFE OF HIS
LOVE OF THE MOTHER WHO HAD LOST HER CHILD
AS HE KNEW THE MOMENT FOR
SILENCE HE KNEW ALSO THE MOMENT FOR SPEECH
OH ADMIRABLE CONSOLER HE
SOUGHT NOT TO EFFACE SORROW BY FORGETFULNESS BUT TO MAGNIFY AND DIGNIFY
IT BY HOPE
HE SAID
HAVE A CARE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU TURN TOWARDS THE DEAD
THINK
NOT OF THAT WHICH PERISHES
GAZE STEADILY
YOU WILL PERCEIVE THE LIVING
LIGHT OF YOUR WELL BELOVED DEAD IN THE DEPTHS OF HEAVEN HE KNEW THAT
FAITH IS WHOLESOME
HE SOUGHT TO COUNSEL AND CALM THE DESPAIRING MAN BY
POINTING OUT TO HIM THE RESIGNED MAN AND TO TRANSFORM THE GRIEF WHICH
GAZES UPON A GRAVE BY SHOWING HIM THE GRIEF WHICH FIXES ITS GAZE UPON A
STAR
CHAPTER V MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG
THE PRIVATE LIFE OF M
MYRIEL WAS FILLED WITH THE SAME THOUGHTS AS HIS
PUBLIC LIFE
THE VOLUNTARY POVERTY IN WHICH THE BISHOP OF D LIVED
WOULD HAVE BEEN A SOLEMN AND CHARMING SIGHT FOR ANY ONE WHO COULD HAVE
VIEWED IT CLOSE AT HAND
LIKE ALL OLD MEN AND LIKE THE MAJORITY OF THINKERS HE SLEPT LITTLE
THIS BRIEF SLUMBER WAS PROFOUND
IN THE MORNING HE MEDITATED FOR AN
HOUR THEN HE SAID HIS MASS EITHER AT THE CATHEDRAL OR IN HIS OWN
HOUSE
HIS MASS SAID HE BROKE HIS FAST ON RYE BREAD DIPPED IN THE MILK
OF HIS OWN COWS
THEN HE SET TO WORK
A BISHOP IS A VERY BUSY MAN HE MUST EVERY DAY RECEIVE THE SECRETARY
OF THE BISHOPRIC WHO IS GENERALLY A CANON AND NEARLY EVERY DAY HIS
VICARS GENERAL
HE HAS CONGREGATIONS TO REPROVE PRIVILEGES TO GRANT
A WHOLE ECCLESIASTICAL LIBRARY TO EXAMINE PRAYER BOOKS DIOCESAN
CATECHISMS BOOKS OF HOURS ETC CHARGES TO WRITE SERMONS TO
AUTHORIZE CURES AND MAYORS TO RECONCILE A CLERICAL CORRESPONDENCE AN
ADMINISTRATIVE CORRESPONDENCE ON ONE SIDE THE STATE ON THE OTHER THE
HOLY SEE AND A THOUSAND MATTERS OF BUSINESS
WHAT TIME WAS LEFT TO HIM AFTER THESE THOUSAND DETAILS OF BUSINESS AND
HIS OFFICES AND HIS BREVIARY HE BESTOWED FIRST ON THE NECESSITOUS
THE SICK AND THE AFFLICTED THE TIME WHICH WAS LEFT TO HIM FROM THE
AFFLICTED THE SICK AND THE NECESSITOUS HE DEVOTED TO WORK
SOMETIMES
HE DUG IN HIS GARDEN AGAIN HE READ OR WROTE
HE HAD BUT ONE WORD
FOR BOTH THESE KINDS OF TOIL HE CALLED THEM GARDENING
THE MIND IS A
GARDEN SAID HE
TOWARDS MID DAY WHEN THE WEATHER WAS FINE HE WENT FORTH AND TOOK A
STROLL IN THE COUNTRY OR IN TOWN OFTEN ENTERING LOWLY DWELLINGS
HE
WAS SEEN WALKING ALONE BURIED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS HIS EYES CAST DOWN
SUPPORTING HIMSELF ON HIS LONG CANE CLAD IN HIS WADDED PURPLE GARMENT
OF SILK WHICH WAS VERY WARM WEARING PURPLE STOCKINGS INSIDE HIS COARSE
SHOES AND SURMOUNTED BY A FLAT HAT WHICH ALLOWED THREE GOLDEN TASSELS
OF LARGE BULLION TO DROOP FROM ITS THREE POINTS
IT WAS A PERFECT FESTIVAL WHEREVER HE APPEARED
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT
HIS PRESENCE HAD SOMETHING WARMING AND LUMINOUS ABOUT IT
THE CHILDREN
AND THE OLD PEOPLE CAME OUT TO THE DOORSTEPS FOR THE BISHOP AS FOR THE
SUN
HE BESTOWED HIS BLESSING AND THEY BLESSED HIM
THEY POINTED OUT
HIS HOUSE TO ANY ONE WHO WAS IN NEED OF ANYTHING
ILLUSTRATION THE COMFORTOR 1B1 5 COMFORTOR
HERE AND THERE HE HALTED ACCOSTED THE LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS AND SMILED
UPON THE MOTHERS
HE VISITED THE POOR SO LONG AS HE HAD ANY MONEY WHEN
HE NO LONGER HAD ANY HE VISITED THE RICH
AS HE MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST A LONG WHILE AND DID NOT WISH TO HAVE IT
NOTICED HE NEVER WENT OUT IN THE TOWN WITHOUT HIS WADDED PURPLE CLOAK
THIS INCONVENIENCED HIM SOMEWHAT IN SUMMER
ON HIS RETURN HE DINED
THE DINNER RESEMBLED HIS BREAKFAST
AT HALF PAST EIGHT IN THE EVENING HE SUPPED WITH HIS SISTER MADAME
MAGLOIRE STANDING BEHIND THEM AND SERVING THEM AT TABLE
NOTHING COULD
BE MORE FRUGAL THAN THIS REPAST
IF HOWEVER THE BISHOP HAD ONE OF HIS
CURES TO SUPPER MADAME MAGLOIRE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO
SERVE MONSEIGNEUR WITH SOME EXCELLENT FISH FROM THE LAKE OR WITH SOME
FINE GAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS
EVERY CURE FURNISHED THE PRETEXT FOR
A GOOD MEAL THE BISHOP DID NOT INTERFERE
WITH THAT EXCEPTION HIS
ORDINARY DIET CONSISTED ONLY OF VEGETABLES BOILED IN WATER AND OIL
SOUP
THUS IT WAS SAID IN THE TOWN WHEN THE BISHOP DOES NOT INDULGE IN
THE CHEER OF A CURE HE INDULGES IN THE CHEER OF A TRAPPIST
AFTER SUPPER HE CONVERSED FOR HALF AN HOUR WITH MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE
AND MADAME MAGLOIRE THEN HE RETIRED TO HIS OWN ROOM AND SET TO WRITING
SOMETIMES ON LOOSE SHEETS AND AGAIN ON THE MARGIN OF SOME FOLIO
HE WAS
A MAN OF LETTERS AND RATHER LEARNED
HE LEFT BEHIND HIM FIVE OR SIX
VERY CURIOUS MANUSCRIPTS AMONG OTHERS A DISSERTATION ON THIS VERSE IN
GENESIS IN THE BEGINNING THE SPIRIT OF GOD FLOATED UPON THE WATERS
WITH THIS VERSE HE COMPARES THREE TEXTS THE ARABIC VERSE WHICH SAYS
THE WINDS OF GOD BLEW FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS WHO SAYS A WIND FROM ABOVE WAS
PRECIPITATED UPON THE EARTH AND FINALLY THE CHALDAIC PARAPHRASE OF
ONKELOS WHICH RENDERS IT A WIND COMING FROM GOD BLEW UPON THE FACE OF
THE WATERS
IN ANOTHER DISSERTATION HE EXAMINES THE THEOLOGICAL WORKS
OF HUGO BISHOP OF PTOLEMAIS GREAT GRAND UNCLE TO THE WRITER OF THIS
BOOK AND ESTABLISHES THE FACT THAT TO THIS BISHOP MUST BE ATTRIBUTED
THE DIVERS LITTLE WORKS PUBLISHED DURING THE LAST CENTURY UNDER THE
PSEUDONYM OF BARLEYCOURT
SOMETIMES IN THE MIDST OF HIS READING NO MATTER WHAT THE BOOK MIGHT
BE WHICH HE HAD IN HIS HAND HE WOULD SUDDENLY FALL INTO A PROFOUND
MEDITATION WHENCE HE ONLY EMERGED TO WRITE A FEW LINES ON THE PAGES OF
THE VOLUME ITSELF
THESE LINES HAVE OFTEN NO CONNECTION WHATEVER WITH
THE BOOK WHICH CONTAINS THEM
WE NOW HAVE UNDER OUR EYES A NOTE WRITTEN
BY HIM ON THE MARGIN OF A QUARTO ENTITLED CORRESPONDENCE OF LORD GERMAIN
WITH GENERALS CLINTON CORNWALLIS AND THE ADMIRALS ON THE AMERICAN
STATION
VERSAILLES POINCOT BOOK SELLER AND PARIS PISSOT
BOOKSELLER QUAI DES AUGUSTINS
HERE IS THE NOTE
OH YOU WHO ARE
ECCLESIASTES CALLS YOU THE ALL POWERFUL THE MACCABEES CALL YOU THE
CREATOR THE EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS CALLS YOU LIBERTY BARUCH CALLS
YOU IMMENSITY THE PSALMS CALL YOU WISDOM AND TRUTH JOHN CALLS YOU
LIGHT THE BOOKS OF KINGS CALL YOU LORD EXODUS CALLS YOU PROVIDENCE
LEVITICUS SANCTITY ESDRAS JUSTICE THE CREATION CALLS YOU GOD MAN
CALLS YOU FATHER BUT SOLOMON CALLS YOU COMPASSION AND THAT IS THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL OF ALL YOUR NAMES
TOWARD NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE TWO WOMEN RETIRED AND BETOOK
THEMSELVES TO THEIR CHAMBERS ON THE FIRST FLOOR LEAVING HIM ALONE UNTIL
MORNING ON THE GROUND FLOOR
IT IS NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD IN THIS PLACE GIVE AN EXACT IDEA OF THE
DWELLING OF THE BISHOP OF D
CHAPTER VI WHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIM
THE HOUSE IN WHICH HE LIVED CONSISTED AS WE HAVE SAID OF A GROUND
FLOOR AND ONE STORY ABOVE THREE ROOMS ON THE GROUND FLOOR THREE
CHAMBERS ON THE FIRST AND AN ATTIC ABOVE
BEHIND THE HOUSE WAS A
GARDEN A QUARTER OF AN ACRE IN EXTENT
THE TWO WOMEN OCCUPIED THE
FIRST FLOOR THE BISHOP WAS LODGED BELOW
THE FIRST ROOM OPENING ON THE
STREET SERVED HIM AS DINING ROOM THE SECOND WAS HIS BEDROOM AND THE
THIRD HIS ORATORY
THERE WAS NO EXIT POSSIBLE FROM THIS ORATORY EXCEPT
BY PASSING THROUGH THE BEDROOM NOR FROM THE BEDROOM WITHOUT PASSING
THROUGH THE DINING ROOM
AT THE END OF THE SUITE IN THE ORATORY THERE
WAS A DETACHED ALCOVE WITH A BED FOR USE IN CASES OF HOSPITALITY
THE BISHOP OFFERED THIS BED TO COUNTRY CURATES WHOM BUSINESS OR THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR PARISHES BROUGHT TO D
THE PHARMACY OF THE HOSPITAL A SMALL BUILDING WHICH HAD BEEN ADDED
TO THE HOUSE AND ABUTTED ON THE GARDEN HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO
A KITCHEN AND CELLAR
IN ADDITION TO THIS THERE WAS IN THE GARDEN A
STABLE WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN THE KITCHEN OF THE HOSPITAL AND IN
WHICH THE BISHOP KEPT TWO COWS
NO MATTER WHAT THE QUANTITY OF MILK THEY
GAVE HE INVARIABLY SENT HALF OF IT EVERY MORNING TO THE SICK PEOPLE IN
THE HOSPITAL
I AM PAYING MY TITHES HE SAID
HIS BEDROOM WAS TOLERABLY LARGE AND RATHER DIFFICULT TO WARM IN BAD
WEATHER
AS WOOD IS EXTREMELY DEAR AT D HE HIT UPON THE IDEA OF
HAVING A COMPARTMENT OF BOARDS CONSTRUCTED IN THE COW SHED
HERE HE
PASSED HIS EVENINGS DURING SEASONS OF SEVERE COLD HE CALLED IT HIS
WINTER SALON
IN THIS WINTER SALON AS IN THE DINING ROOM THERE WAS NO OTHER
FURNITURE THAN A SQUARE TABLE IN WHITE WOOD AND FOUR STRAW SEATED
CHAIRS
IN ADDITION TO THIS THE DINING ROOM WAS ORNAMENTED WITH AN
ANTIQUE SIDEBOARD PAINTED PINK IN WATER COLORS
OUT OF A SIMILAR
SIDEBOARD PROPERLY DRAPED WITH WHITE NAPERY AND IMITATION LACE THE
BISHOP HAD CONSTRUCTED THE ALTAR WHICH DECORATED HIS ORATORY
HIS WEALTHY PENITENTS AND THE SAINTED WOMEN OF D HAD MORE THAN ONCE
ASSESSED THEMSELVES TO RAISE THE MONEY FOR A NEW ALTAR FOR MONSEIGNEUR'S
ORATORY ON EACH OCCASION HE HAD TAKEN THE MONEY AND HAD GIVEN IT TO
THE POOR
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALTARS HE SAID IS THE SOUL OF AN
UNHAPPY CREATURE CONSOLED AND THANKING GOD
IN HIS ORATORY THERE WERE TWO STRAW PRIE DIEU AND THERE WAS AN
ARM CHAIR ALSO IN STRAW IN HIS BEDROOM
WHEN BY CHANCE HE RECEIVED
SEVEN OR EIGHT PERSONS AT ONE TIME THE PREFECT OR THE GENERAL OR THE
STAFF OF THE REGIMENT IN GARRISON OR SEVERAL PUPILS FROM THE LITTLE
SEMINARY THE CHAIRS HAD TO BE FETCHED FROM THE WINTER SALON IN THE
STABLE THE PRIE DIEU FROM THE ORATORY AND THE ARM CHAIR FROM THE
BEDROOM IN THIS WAY AS MANY AS ELEVEN CHAIRS COULD BE COLLECTED FOR THE
VISITORS
A ROOM WAS DISMANTLED FOR EACH NEW GUEST
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT THERE WERE TWELVE IN THE PARTY THE BISHOP
THEN RELIEVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF THE SITUATION BY STANDING IN FRONT
OF THE CHIMNEY IF IT WAS WINTER OR BY STROLLING IN THE GARDEN IF IT WAS
SUMMER
THERE WAS STILL ANOTHER CHAIR IN THE DETACHED ALCOVE BUT THE STRAW WAS
HALF GONE FROM IT AND IT HAD BUT THREE LEGS SO THAT IT WAS OF SERVICE
ONLY WHEN PROPPED AGAINST THE WALL
MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE HAD ALSO IN
HER OWN ROOM A VERY LARGE EASY CHAIR OF WOOD WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN
GILDED AND WHICH WAS COVERED WITH FLOWERED PEKIN BUT THEY HAD BEEN
OBLIGED TO HOIST THIS BERGERE UP TO THE FIRST STORY THROUGH THE WINDOW
AS THE STAIRCASE WAS TOO NARROW IT COULD NOT THEREFORE BE RECKONED
AMONG THE POSSIBILITIES IN THE WAY OF FURNITURE
MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE'S AMBITION HAD BEEN TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A SET
OF DRAWING ROOM FURNITURE IN YELLOW UTRECHT VELVET STAMPED WITH A ROSE
PATTERN AND WITH MAHOGANY IN SWAN'S NECK STYLE WITH A SOFA
BUT THIS
WOULD HAVE COST FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS AT LEAST AND IN VIEW OF THE FACT
THAT SHE HAD ONLY BEEN ABLE TO LAY BY FORTY TWO FRANCS AND TEN SOUS FOR
THIS PURPOSE IN THE COURSE OF FIVE YEARS SHE HAD ENDED BY RENOUNCING
THE IDEA
HOWEVER WHO IS THERE WHO HAS ATTAINED HIS IDEAL
NOTHING IS MORE EASY TO PRESENT TO THE IMAGINATION THAN THE BISHOP'S
BEDCHAMBER
A GLAZED DOOR OPENED ON THE GARDEN OPPOSITE THIS WAS THE
BED A HOSPITAL BED OF IRON WITH A CANOPY OF GREEN SERGE IN THE
SHADOW OF THE BED BEHIND A CURTAIN WERE THE UTENSILS OF THE TOILET
WHICH STILL BETRAYED THE ELEGANT HABITS OF THE MAN OF THE WORLD THERE
WERE TWO DOORS ONE NEAR THE CHIMNEY OPENING INTO THE ORATORY THE
OTHER NEAR THE BOOKCASE OPENING INTO THE DINING ROOM
THE BOOKCASE WAS
A LARGE CUPBOARD WITH GLASS DOORS FILLED WITH BOOKS THE CHIMNEY WAS OF
WOOD PAINTED TO REPRESENT MARBLE AND HABITUALLY WITHOUT FIRE
IN THE
CHIMNEY STOOD A PAIR OF FIREDOGS OF IRON ORNAMENTED ABOVE WITH TWO
GARLANDED VASES AND FLUTINGS WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN SILVERED
WITH SILVER LEAF WHICH WAS A SORT OF EPISCOPAL LUXURY ABOVE THE
CHIMNEY PIECE HUNG A CRUCIFIX OF COPPER WITH THE SILVER WORN OFF FIXED
ON A BACKGROUND OF THREADBARE VELVET IN A WOODEN FRAME FROM WHICH THE
GILDING HAD FALLEN NEAR THE GLASS DOOR A LARGE TABLE WITH AN INKSTAND
LOADED WITH A CONFUSION OF PAPERS AND WITH HUGE VOLUMES BEFORE THE
TABLE AN ARM CHAIR OF STRAW IN FRONT OF THE BED A PRIE DIEU BORROWED
FROM THE ORATORY
TWO PORTRAITS IN OVAL FRAMES WERE FASTENED TO THE WALL ON EACH SIDE OF
THE BED
SMALL GILT INSCRIPTIONS ON THE PLAIN SURFACE OF THE CLOTH AT
THE SIDE OF THESE FIGURES INDICATED THAT THE PORTRAITS REPRESENTED
ONE THE ABBE OF CHALIOT BISHOP OF SAINT CLAUDE THE OTHER THE ABBE
TOURTEAU VICAR GENERAL OF AGDE ABBE OF GRAND CHAMP ORDER OF CITEAUX
DIOCESE OF CHARTRES
WHEN THE BISHOP SUCCEEDED TO THIS APARTMENT AFTER
THE HOSPITAL PATIENTS HE HAD FOUND THESE PORTRAITS THERE AND HAD LEFT
THEM
THEY WERE PRIESTS AND PROBABLY DONORS TWO REASONS FOR RESPECTING
THEM
ALL THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THESE TWO PERSONS WAS THAT THEY HAD
BEEN APPOINTED BY THE KING THE ONE TO HIS BISHOPRIC THE OTHER TO HIS
BENEFICE ON THE SAME DAY THE 27TH OF APRIL 1785
MADAME MAGLOIRE
HAVING TAKEN THE PICTURES DOWN TO DUST THE BISHOP HAD DISCOVERED THESE
PARTICULARS WRITTEN IN WHITISH INK ON A LITTLE SQUARE OF PAPER YELLOWED
BY TIME AND ATTACHED TO THE BACK OF THE PORTRAIT OF THE ABBE OF
GRAND CHAMP WITH FOUR WAFERS
AT HIS WINDOW HE HAD AN ANTIQUE CURTAIN OF A COARSE WOOLLEN STUFF WHICH
FINALLY BECAME SO OLD THAT IN ORDER TO AVOID THE EXPENSE OF A NEW ONE
MADAME MAGLOIRE WAS FORCED TO TAKE A LARGE SEAM IN THE VERY MIDDLE
OF IT
THIS SEAM TOOK THE FORM OF A CROSS
THE BISHOP OFTEN CALLED
ATTENTION TO IT HOW DELIGHTFUL THAT IS HE SAID
ALL THE ROOMS IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT EXCEPTION THOSE ON THE GROUND
FLOOR AS WELL AS THOSE ON THE FIRST FLOOR WERE WHITE WASHED WHICH IS A
FASHION IN BARRACKS AND HOSPITALS
HOWEVER IN THEIR LATTER YEARS MADAME MAGLOIRE DISCOVERED BENEATH THE
PAPER WHICH HAD BEEN WASHED OVER PAINTINGS ORNAMENTING THE APARTMENT
OF MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE AS WE SHALL SEE FURTHER ON
BEFORE BECOMING
A HOSPITAL THIS HOUSE HAD BEEN THE ANCIENT PARLIAMENT HOUSE OF THE
BOURGEOIS
HENCE THIS DECORATION
THE CHAMBERS WERE PAVED IN RED BRICKS
WHICH WERE WASHED EVERY WEEK WITH STRAW MATS IN FRONT OF ALL THE BEDS
ALTOGETHER THIS DWELLING WHICH WAS ATTENDED TO BY THE TWO WOMEN WAS
EXQUISITELY CLEAN FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
THIS WAS THE SOLE LUXURY WHICH THE
BISHOP PERMITTED
HE SAID THAT TAKES NOTHING FROM THE POOR
IT MUST BE CONFESSED HOWEVER THAT HE STILL RETAINED FROM HIS FORMER
POSSESSIONS SIX SILVER KNIVES AND FORKS AND A SOUP LADLE WHICH
MADAME MAGLOIRE CONTEMPLATED EVERY DAY WITH DELIGHT AS THEY GLISTENED
SPLENDIDLY UPON THE COARSE LINEN CLOTH
AND SINCE WE ARE NOW PAINTING
THE BISHOP OF D AS HE WAS IN REALITY WE MUST ADD THAT HE HAD SAID
MORE THAN ONCE I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO RENOUNCE EATING FROM SILVER
DISHES
TO THIS SILVERWARE MUST BE ADDED TWO LARGE CANDLESTICKS OF MASSIVE
SILVER WHICH HE HAD INHERITED FROM A GREAT AUNT
THESE CANDLESTICKS
HELD TWO WAX CANDLES AND USUALLY FIGURED ON THE BISHOP'S CHIMNEY PIECE
WHEN HE HAD ANY ONE TO DINNER MADAME MAGLOIRE LIGHTED THE TWO CANDLES
AND SET THE CANDLESTICKS ON THE TABLE
IN THE BISHOP'S OWN CHAMBER AT THE HEAD OF HIS BED THERE WAS A SMALL
CUPBOARD IN WHICH MADAME MAGLOIRE LOCKED UP THE SIX SILVER KNIVES AND
FORKS AND THE BIG SPOON EVERY NIGHT
BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO ADD THAT
THE KEY WAS NEVER REMOVED
THE GARDEN WHICH HAD BEEN RATHER SPOILED BY THE UGLY BUILDINGS WHICH
WE HAVE MENTIONED WAS COMPOSED OF FOUR ALLEYS IN CROSS FORM RADIATING
FROM A TANK
ANOTHER WALK MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE GARDEN AND SKIRTED
THE WHITE WALL WHICH ENCLOSED IT
THESE ALLEYS LEFT BEHIND THEM FOUR
SQUARE PLOTS RIMMED WITH BOX
IN THREE OF THESE MADAME MAGLOIRE
CULTIVATED VEGETABLES IN THE FOURTH THE BISHOP HAD PLANTED SOME
FLOWERS HERE AND THERE STOOD A FEW FRUIT TREES
MADAME MAGLOIRE HAD
ONCE REMARKED WITH A SORT OF GENTLE MALICE MONSEIGNEUR YOU WHO TURN
EVERYTHING TO ACCOUNT HAVE NEVERTHELESS ONE USELESS PLOT
IT WOULD BE
BETTER TO GROW SALADS THERE THAN BOUQUETS MADAME MAGLOIRE RETORTED
THE BISHOP YOU ARE MISTAKEN
THE BEAUTIFUL IS AS USEFUL AS THE
USEFUL HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE MORE SO PERHAPS
THIS PLOT CONSISTING OF THREE OR FOUR BEDS OCCUPIED THE BISHOP
ALMOST AS MUCH AS DID HIS BOOKS
HE LIKED TO PASS AN HOUR OR TWO THERE
TRIMMING HOEING AND MAKING HOLES HERE AND THERE IN THE EARTH INTO
WHICH HE DROPPED SEEDS
HE WAS NOT AS HOSTILE TO INSECTS AS A GARDENER
COULD HAVE WISHED TO SEE HIM
MOREOVER HE MADE NO PRETENSIONS TO
BOTANY HE IGNORED GROUPS AND CONSISTENCY HE MADE NOT THE SLIGHTEST
EFFORT TO DECIDE BETWEEN TOURNEFORT AND THE NATURAL METHOD HE TOOK PART
NEITHER WITH THE BUDS AGAINST THE COTYLEDONS NOR WITH JUSSIEU AGAINST
LINNAEUS
HE DID NOT STUDY PLANTS HE LOVED FLOWERS
HE RESPECTED
LEARNED MEN GREATLY HE RESPECTED THE IGNORANT STILL MORE AND WITHOUT
EVER FAILING IN THESE TWO RESPECTS HE WATERED HIS FLOWER BEDS EVERY
SUMMER EVENING WITH A TIN WATERING POT PAINTED GREEN
THE HOUSE HAD NOT A SINGLE DOOR WHICH COULD BE LOCKED
THE DOOR OF THE
DINING ROOM WHICH AS WE HAVE SAID OPENED DIRECTLY ON THE CATHEDRAL
SQUARE HAD FORMERLY BEEN ORNAMENTED WITH LOCKS AND BOLTS LIKE THE DOOR
OF A PRISON
THE BISHOP HAD HAD ALL THIS IRONWORK REMOVED AND THIS DOOR
WAS NEVER FASTENED EITHER BY NIGHT OR BY DAY WITH ANYTHING EXCEPT THE
LATCH
ALL THAT THE FIRST PASSERBY HAD TO DO AT ANY HOUR WAS TO GIVE IT
A PUSH
AT FIRST THE TWO WOMEN HAD BEEN VERY MUCH TRIED BY THIS DOOR
WHICH WAS NEVER FASTENED BUT MONSIEUR DE D HAD SAID TO THEM HAVE
BOLTS PUT ON YOUR ROOMS IF THAT WILL PLEASE YOU THEY HAD ENDED BY
SHARING HIS CONFIDENCE OR BY AT LEAST ACTING AS THOUGH THEY SHARED IT
MADAME MAGLOIRE ALONE HAD FRIGHTS FROM TIME TO TIME
AS FOR THE BISHOP
HIS THOUGHT CAN BE FOUND EXPLAINED OR AT LEAST INDICATED IN THE THREE
LINES WHICH HE WROTE ON THE MARGIN OF A BIBLE THIS IS THE SHADE OF
DIFFERENCE THE DOOR OF THE PHYSICIAN SHOULD NEVER BE SHUT THE DOOR OF
THE PRIEST SHOULD ALWAYS BE OPEN
ON ANOTHER BOOK ENTITLED PHILOSOPHY OF THE MEDICAL SCIENCE HE HAD
WRITTEN THIS OTHER NOTE AM NOT I A PHYSICIAN LIKE THEM I ALSO HAVE MY
PATIENTS AND THEN TOO I HAVE SOME WHOM I CALL MY UNFORTUNATES
AGAIN HE WROTE DO NOT INQUIRE THE NAME OF HIM WHO ASKS A SHELTER OF
YOU
THE VERY MAN WHO IS EMBARRASSED BY HIS NAME IS THE ONE WHO NEEDS
SHELTER
IT CHANCED THAT A WORTHY CURE I KNOW NOT WHETHER IT WAS THE CURE OF
COULOUBROUX OR THE CURE OF POMPIERRY TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD TO ASK
HIM ONE DAY PROBABLY AT THE INSTIGATION OF MADAME MAGLOIRE WHETHER
MONSIEUR WAS SURE THAT HE WAS NOT COMMITTING AN INDISCRETION TO A
CERTAIN EXTENT IN LEAVING HIS DOOR UNFASTENED DAY AND NIGHT AT THE
MERCY OF ANY ONE WHO SHOULD CHOOSE TO ENTER AND WHETHER IN SHORT
HE DID NOT FEAR LEST SOME MISFORTUNE MIGHT OCCUR IN A HOUSE SO LITTLE
GUARDED
THE BISHOP TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER WITH GENTLE GRAVITY AND
SAID TO HIM NISI DOMINUS CUSTODIERIT DOMUM IN VANUM VIGILANT QUI
CUSTODIUNT EAM UNLESS THE LORD GUARD THE HOUSE IN VAIN DO THEY WATCH
WHO GUARD IT
THEN HE SPOKE OF SOMETHING ELSE
HE WAS FOND OF SAYING THERE IS A BRAVERY OF THE PRIEST AS WELL AS
THE BRAVERY OF A COLONEL OF DRAGOONS ONLY HE ADDED OURS MUST BE
TRANQUIL
CHAPTER VII CRAVATTE
IT IS HERE THAT A FACT FALLS NATURALLY INTO PLACE WHICH WE MUST NOT
OMIT BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE SORT WHICH SHOW US BEST WHAT SORT OF A
MAN THE BISHOP OF D WAS
AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BAND OF GASPARD BES WHO HAD INFESTED THE
GORGES OF OLLIOULES ONE OF HIS LIEUTENANTS CRAVATTE TOOK REFUGE IN
THE MOUNTAINS
HE CONCEALED HIMSELF FOR SOME TIME WITH HIS BANDITS THE
REMNANT OF GASPARD BES'S TROOP IN THE COUNTY OF NICE THEN HE MADE HIS
WAY TO PIEDMONT AND SUDDENLY REAPPEARED IN FRANCE IN THE VICINITY
OF BARCELONETTE
HE WAS FIRST SEEN AT JAUZIERS THEN AT TUILES
HE HID
HIMSELF IN THE CAVERNS OF THE JOUG DE L'AIGLE AND THENCE HE DESCENDED
TOWARDS THE HAMLETS AND VILLAGES THROUGH THE RAVINES OF UBAYE AND
UBAYETTE
HE EVEN PUSHED AS FAR AS EMBRUN ENTERED THE CATHEDRAL ONE NIGHT
AND DESPOILED THE SACRISTY
HIS HIGHWAY ROBBERIES LAID WASTE THE
COUNTRY SIDE
THE GENDARMES WERE SET ON HIS TRACK BUT IN VAIN
HE
ALWAYS ESCAPED SOMETIMES HE RESISTED BY MAIN FORCE
HE WAS A BOLD
WRETCH
IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS TERROR THE BISHOP ARRIVED
HE WAS
MAKING HIS CIRCUIT TO CHASTELAR
THE MAYOR CAME TO MEET HIM AND URGED
HIM TO RETRACE HIS STEPS
CRAVATTE WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE MOUNTAINS
AS FAR AS ARCHE AND BEYOND THERE WAS DANGER EVEN WITH AN ESCORT IT
MERELY EXPOSED THREE OR FOUR UNFORTUNATE GENDARMES TO NO PURPOSE
THEREFORE SAID THE BISHOP I INTEND TO GO WITHOUT ESCORT
YOU DO NOT REALLY MEAN THAT MONSEIGNEUR EXCLAIMED THE MAYOR
I DO MEAN IT SO THOROUGHLY THAT I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE ANY GENDARMES AND
SHALL SET OUT IN AN HOUR
SET OUT
SET OUT
ALONE
ALONE
MONSEIGNEUR YOU WILL NOT DO THAT
THERE EXISTS YONDER IN THE MOUNTAINS SAID THE BISHOP A TINY
COMMUNITY NO BIGGER THAN THAT WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR THREE YEARS
THEY ARE MY GOOD FRIENDS THOSE GENTLE AND HONEST SHEPHERDS
THEY OWN
ONE GOAT OUT OF EVERY THIRTY THAT THEY TEND
THEY MAKE VERY PRETTY
WOOLLEN CORDS OF VARIOUS COLORS AND THEY PLAY THE MOUNTAIN AIRS ON
LITTLE FLUTES WITH SIX HOLES
THEY NEED TO BE TOLD OF THE GOOD GOD NOW
AND THEN
WHAT WOULD THEY SAY TO A BISHOP WHO WAS AFRAID WHAT WOULD
THEY SAY IF I DID NOT GO
BUT THE BRIGANDS MONSEIGNEUR
HOLD SAID THE BISHOP I MUST THINK OF THAT
YOU ARE RIGHT
I MAY
MEET THEM
THEY TOO NEED TO BE TOLD OF THE GOOD GOD
BUT MONSEIGNEUR THERE IS A BAND OF THEM A FLOCK OF WOLVES
MONSIEUR LE MAIRE IT MAY BE THAT IT IS OF THIS VERY FLOCK OF WOLVES
THAT JESUS HAS CONSTITUTED ME THE SHEPHERD
WHO KNOWS THE WAYS OF
PROVIDENCE
THEY WILL ROB YOU MONSEIGNEUR
I HAVE NOTHING
THEY WILL KILL YOU
AN OLD GOODMAN OF A PRIEST WHO PASSES ALONG MUMBLING HIS PRAYERS BAH
TO WHAT PURPOSE
OH MON DIEU WHAT IF YOU SHOULD MEET THEM
I SHOULD BEG ALMS OF THEM FOR MY POOR
DO NOT GO MONSEIGNEUR
IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN YOU ARE RISKING YOUR
LIFE
MONSIEUR LE MAIRE SAID THE BISHOP IS THAT REALLY ALL I AM NOT IN
THE WORLD TO GUARD MY OWN LIFE BUT TO GUARD SOULS
THEY HAD TO ALLOW HIM TO DO AS HE PLEASED
HE SET OUT ACCOMPANIED ONLY
BY A CHILD WHO OFFERED TO SERVE AS A GUIDE
HIS OBSTINACY WAS BRUITED
ABOUT THE COUNTRY SIDE AND CAUSED GREAT CONSTERNATION
HE WOULD TAKE NEITHER HIS SISTER NOR MADAME MAGLOIRE
HE TRAVERSED THE
MOUNTAIN ON MULE BACK ENCOUNTERED NO ONE AND ARRIVED SAFE AND SOUND
AT THE RESIDENCE OF HIS GOOD FRIENDS THE SHEPHERDS
HE REMAINED
THERE FOR A FORTNIGHT PREACHING ADMINISTERING THE SACRAMENT TEACHING
EXHORTING
WHEN THE TIME OF HIS DEPARTURE APPROACHED HE RESOLVED TO
CHANT A TE DEUM PONTIFICALLY
HE MENTIONED IT TO THE CURE
BUT WHAT WAS
TO BE DONE THERE WERE NO EPISCOPAL ORNAMENTS
THEY COULD ONLY PLACE AT
HIS DISPOSAL A WRETCHED VILLAGE SACRISTY WITH A FEW ANCIENT CHASUBLES
OF THREADBARE DAMASK ADORNED WITH IMITATION LACE
BAH SAID THE BISHOP
LET US ANNOUNCE OUR TE DEUM FROM THE PULPIT
NEVERTHELESS MONSIEUR LE CURE
THINGS WILL ARRANGE THEMSELVES
THEY INSTITUTED A SEARCH IN THE CHURCHES OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
ALL THE
MAGNIFICENCE OF THESE HUMBLE PARISHES COMBINED WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICED
TO CLOTHE THE CHORISTER OF A CATHEDRAL PROPERLY
WHILE THEY WERE THUS EMBARRASSED A LARGE CHEST WAS BROUGHT AND
DEPOSITED IN THE PRESBYTERY FOR THE BISHOP BY TWO UNKNOWN HORSEMEN WHO
DEPARTED ON THE INSTANT
THE CHEST WAS OPENED IT CONTAINED A COPE OF
CLOTH OF GOLD A MITRE ORNAMENTED WITH DIAMONDS AN ARCHBISHOP'S CROSS
A MAGNIFICENT CROSIER ALL THE PONTIFICAL VESTMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN
STOLEN A MONTH PREVIOUSLY FROM THE TREASURY OF NOTRE DAME D'EMBRUN
IN
THE CHEST WAS A PAPER ON WHICH THESE WORDS WERE WRITTEN FROM CRAVATTE
TO MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU
DID NOT I SAY THAT THINGS WOULD COME RIGHT OF THEMSELVES SAID THE
BISHOP
THEN HE ADDED WITH A SMILE TO HIM WHO CONTENTS HIMSELF WITH
THE SURPLICE OF A CURATE GOD SENDS THE COPE OF AN ARCHBISHOP
MONSEIGNEUR MURMURED THE CURE THROWING BACK HIS HEAD WITH A SMILE
GOD OR THE DEVIL
THE BISHOP LOOKED STEADILY AT THE CURE AND REPEATED WITH AUTHORITY
GOD
WHEN HE RETURNED TO CHASTELAR THE PEOPLE CAME OUT TO STARE AT HIM AS AT
A CURIOSITY ALL ALONG THE ROAD
AT THE PRIEST'S HOUSE IN CHASTELAR HE
REJOINED MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE AND MADAME MAGLOIRE WHO WERE WAITING
FOR HIM AND HE SAID TO HIS SISTER WELL WAS I IN THE RIGHT THE POOR
PRIEST WENT TO HIS POOR MOUNTAINEERS WITH EMPTY HANDS AND HE RETURNS
FROM THEM WITH HIS HANDS FULL
I SET OUT BEARING ONLY MY FAITH IN GOD I
HAVE BROUGHT BACK THE TREASURE OF A CATHEDRAL
THAT EVENING BEFORE HE WENT TO BED HE SAID AGAIN LET US NEVER FEAR
ROBBERS NOR MURDERERS
THOSE ARE DANGERS FROM WITHOUT PETTY DANGERS
LET US FEAR OURSELVES
PREJUDICES ARE THE REAL ROBBERS VICES ARE THE
REAL MURDERERS
THE GREAT DANGERS LIE WITHIN OURSELVES
WHAT MATTERS IT
WHAT THREATENS OUR HEAD OR OUR PURSE LET US THINK ONLY OF THAT WHICH
THREATENS OUR SOUL
THEN TURNING TO HIS SISTER SISTER NEVER A PRECAUTION ON THE PART
OF THE PRIEST AGAINST HIS FELLOW MAN
THAT WHICH HIS FELLOW DOES GOD
PERMITS
LET US CONFINE OURSELVES TO PRAYER WHEN WE THINK THAT A DANGER
IS APPROACHING US
LET US PRAY NOT FOR OURSELVES BUT THAT OUR BROTHER
MAY NOT FALL INTO SIN ON OUR ACCOUNT
HOWEVER SUCH INCIDENTS WERE RARE IN HIS LIFE
WE RELATE THOSE OF WHICH
WE KNOW BUT GENERALLY HE PASSED HIS LIFE IN DOING THE SAME THINGS AT
THE SAME MOMENT
ONE MONTH OF HIS YEAR RESEMBLED ONE HOUR OF HIS DAY
AS TO WHAT BECAME OF THE TREASURE OF THE CATHEDRAL OF EMBRUN WE
SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED BY ANY INQUIRY IN THAT DIRECTION
IT CONSISTED OF
VERY HANDSOME THINGS VERY TEMPTING THINGS AND THINGS WHICH WERE VERY
WELL ADAPTED TO BE STOLEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UNFORTUNATE
STOLEN
THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN ELSEWHERE
HALF OF THE ADVENTURE WAS COMPLETED IT
ONLY REMAINED TO IMPART A NEW DIRECTION TO THE THEFT AND TO CAUSE IT
TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE POOR
HOWEVER WE MAKE NO
ASSERTIONS ON THIS POINT
ONLY A RATHER OBSCURE NOTE WAS FOUND AMONG
THE BISHOP'S PAPERS WHICH MAY BEAR SOME RELATION TO THIS MATTER AND
WHICH IS COUCHED IN THESE TERMS THE QUESTION IS TO DECIDE WHETHER
THIS SHOULD BE TURNED OVER TO THE CATHEDRAL OR TO THE HOSPITAL
CHAPTER VIII PHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING
THE SENATOR ABOVE MENTIONED WAS A CLEVER MAN WHO HAD MADE HIS OWN WAY
HEEDLESS OF THOSE THINGS WHICH PRESENT OBSTACLES AND WHICH ARE CALLED
CONSCIENCE SWORN FAITH JUSTICE DUTY HE HAD MARCHED STRAIGHT TO HIS
GOAL WITHOUT ONCE FLINCHING IN THE LINE OF HIS ADVANCEMENT AND HIS
INTEREST
HE WAS AN OLD ATTORNEY SOFTENED BY SUCCESS NOT A BAD MAN BY
ANY MEANS WHO RENDERED ALL THE SMALL SERVICES IN HIS POWER TO HIS SONS
HIS SONS IN LAW HIS RELATIONS AND EVEN TO HIS FRIENDS HAVING WISELY
SEIZED UPON IN LIFE GOOD SIDES GOOD OPPORTUNITIES GOOD WINDFALLS
EVERYTHING ELSE SEEMED TO HIM VERY STUPID
HE WAS INTELLIGENT AND JUST
SUFFICIENTLY EDUCATED TO THINK HIMSELF A DISCIPLE OF EPICURUS WHILE HE
WAS IN REALITY ONLY A PRODUCT OF PIGAULT LEBRUN
HE LAUGHED WILLINGLY
AND PLEASANTLY OVER INFINITE AND ETERNAL THINGS AND AT THE CROTCHETS
OF THAT GOOD OLD FELLOW THE BISHOP HE EVEN SOMETIMES LAUGHED AT HIM
WITH AN AMIABLE AUTHORITY IN THE PRESENCE OF M
MYRIEL HIMSELF WHO
LISTENED TO HIM
ON SOME SEMI OFFICIAL OCCASION OR OTHER I DO NOT RECOLLECT WHAT
COUNT THIS SENATOR AND M
MYRIEL WERE TO DINE WITH THE PREFECT
AT DESSERT THE SENATOR WHO WAS SLIGHTLY EXHILARATED THOUGH STILL
PERFECTLY DIGNIFIED EXCLAIMED
EGAD BISHOP LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION
IT IS HARD FOR A SENATOR AND A
BISHOP TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT WINKING
WE ARE TWO AUGURS
I AM
GOING TO MAKE A CONFESSION TO YOU
I HAVE A PHILOSOPHY OF MY OWN
AND YOU ARE RIGHT REPLIED THE BISHOP
AS ONE MAKES ONE'S PHILOSOPHY
SO ONE LIES ON IT
YOU ARE ON THE BED OF PURPLE SENATOR

EVERYTHING I DO I MUST CUDGEL MY BRAINS OVER GOOD AND EVIL OVER THE
JUST AND THE UNJUST OVER THE FAS AND THE NEFAS

BOTTOM I AM
IMMORTALITY BISHOP IS A CHANCE A WAITING FOR DEAD MEN'S
SHOES
AH WHAT A CHARMING PROMISE TRUST TO IT IF YOU LIKE WHAT A
FINE LOT ADAM HAS WE ARE SOULS AND WE SHALL BE ANGELS WITH BLUE WINGS
ON OUR SHOULDER BLADES
DO COME TO MY ASSISTANCE IS IT NOT TERTULLIAN
WHO SAYS THAT THE BLESSED SHALL TRAVEL FROM STAR TO STAR VERY WELL
WE
SHALL BE THE GRASSHOPPERS OF THE STARS
AND THEN BESIDES WE SHALL
SEE GOD
TA TA TA WHAT TWADDLE ALL THESE PARADISES ARE GOD IS A
NONSENSICAL MONSTER
I WOULD NOT SAY THAT IN THE MONITEUR EGAD BUT I
MAY WHISPER IT AMONG FRIENDS
INTER POCULA
TO SACRIFICE THE WORLD TO
PARADISE IS TO LET SLIP THE PREY FOR THE SHADOW
BE THE DUPE OF THE
INFINITE I'M NOT SUCH A FOOL
I AM A NOUGHT

COMTE NOUGHT SENATOR
DID I EXIST BEFORE MY BIRTH NO

IT IS BETTER TO BE THE TOOTH THAN THE GRASS
SUCH IS MY
WISDOM
AFTER WHICH GO WHITHER I PUSH THEE THE GRAVE DIGGER IS THERE
THE PANTHEON FOR SOME OF US ALL FALLS INTO THE GREAT HOLE
END
FINIS
TOTAL LIQUIDATION
THIS IS THE VANISHING POINT
DEATH IS DEATH BELIEVE
ME
I LAUGH AT THE IDEA OF THERE BEING ANY ONE WHO HAS ANYTHING TO TELL
ME ON THAT SUBJECT
FABLES OF NURSES BUGABOO FOR CHILDREN JEHOVAH FOR
MEN
NO OUR TO MORROW IS THE NIGHT
BEYOND THE TOMB THERE IS NOTHING
BUT EQUAL NOTHINGNESS
YOU HAVE BEEN SARDANAPALUS YOU HAVE BEEN VINCENT
DE PAUL IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
THAT IS THE TRUTH
THEN LIVE YOUR LIFE
ABOVE ALL THINGS
MAKE USE OF YOUR I WHILE YOU HAVE IT
IN TRUTH
BISHOP I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A PHILOSOPHY OF MY OWN AND I HAVE MY
PHILOSOPHERS
I DON'T LET MYSELF BE TAKEN IN WITH THAT NONSENSE
OF COURSE THERE MUST BE SOMETHING FOR THOSE WHO ARE DOWN FOR THE
BAREFOOTED BEGGARS KNIFE GRINDERS AND MISERABLE WRETCHES
LEGENDS
CHIMERAS THE SOUL IMMORTALITY PARADISE THE STARS ARE PROVIDED FOR
THEM TO SWALLOW
THEY GOBBLE IT DOWN
THEY SPREAD IT ON THEIR DRY BREAD
HE WHO HAS NOTHING ELSE HAS THE GOOD
GOD
THAT IS THE LEAST HE CAN
HAVE
I OPPOSE NO OBJECTION TO THAT BUT I RESERVE MONSIEUR NAIGEON FOR
MYSELF
THE GOOD GOD IS GOOD FOR THE POPULACE
THE BISHOP CLAPPED HIS HANDS
THAT'S TALKING HE EXCLAIMED
WHAT AN EXCELLENT AND REALLY MARVELLOUS
THING IS THIS MATERIALISM NOT EVERY ONE WHO WANTS IT CAN HAVE IT
AH
WHEN ONE DOES HAVE IT ONE IS NO LONGER A DUPE ONE DOES NOT STUPIDLY
ALLOW ONE'S SELF TO BE EXILED LIKE CATO NOR STONED LIKE STEPHEN NOR
BURNED ALIVE LIKE JEANNE D'ARC
THOSE WHO HAVE SUCCEEDED IN PROCURING
THIS ADMIRABLE MATERIALISM HAVE THE JOY OF FEELING THEMSELVES
IRRESPONSIBLE AND OF THINKING THAT THEY CAN DEVOUR EVERYTHING WITHOUT
UNEASINESS PLACES SINECURES DIGNITIES POWER WHETHER WELL OR
ILL ACQUIRED LUCRATIVE RECANTATIONS USEFUL TREACHERIES SAVORY
CAPITULATIONS OF CONSCIENCE AND THAT THEY SHALL ENTER THE TOMB WITH
THEIR DIGESTION ACCOMPLISHED
HOW AGREEABLE THAT IS I DO NOT SAY THAT
WITH REFERENCE TO YOU SENATOR
NEVERTHELESS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
TO REFRAIN FROM CONGRATULATING YOU
YOU GREAT LORDS HAVE SO YOU SAY A
PHILOSOPHY OF YOUR OWN AND FOR YOURSELVES WHICH IS EXQUISITE REFINED
ACCESSIBLE TO THE RICH ALONE GOOD FOR ALL SAUCES AND WHICH SEASONS
THE VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF LIFE ADMIRABLY
THIS PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN
EXTRACTED FROM THE DEPTHS AND UNEARTHED BY SPECIAL SEEKERS
BUT YOU ARE
GOOD NATURED PRINCES AND YOU DO NOT THINK IT A BAD THING THAT BELIEF IN
THE GOOD GOD SHOULD CONSTITUTE THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH
AS THE GOOSE STUFFED WITH CHESTNUTS IS THE TRUFFLED TURKEY OF THE POOR
CHAPTER IX THE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER
IN ORDER TO FURNISH AN IDEA OF THE PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
BISHOP OF D AND OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE TWO SAINTED WOMEN
SUBORDINATED THEIR ACTIONS THEIR THOUGHTS THEIR FEMININE INSTINCTS
EVEN WHICH ARE EASILY ALARMED TO THE HABITS AND PURPOSES OF THE
BISHOP WITHOUT HIS EVEN TAKING THE TROUBLE OF SPEAKING IN ORDER TO
EXPLAIN THEM WE CANNOT DO BETTER THAN TRANSCRIBE IN THIS PLACE A LETTER
FROM MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE TO MADAME THE VICOMTESS DE BOISCHEVRON THE
FRIEND OF HER CHILDHOOD
THIS LETTER IS IN OUR POSSESSION
D DEC
16 18
MY GOOD MADAM NOT A DAY PASSES WITHOUT OUR SPEAKING OF YOU
IT IS OUR
ESTABLISHED CUSTOM BUT THERE IS ANOTHER REASON BESIDES
JUST IMAGINE
WHILE WASHING AND DUSTING THE CEILINGS AND WALLS MADAM MAGLOIRE HAS
MADE SOME DISCOVERIES NOW OUR TWO CHAMBERS HUNG WITH ANTIQUE PAPER
WHITEWASHED OVER WOULD NOT DISCREDIT A CHATEAU IN THE STYLE OF YOURS
MADAM MAGLOIRE HAS PULLED OFF ALL THE PAPER
THERE WERE THINGS BENEATH
MY DRAWING ROOM WHICH CONTAINS NO FURNITURE AND WHICH WE USE FOR
SPREADING OUT THE LINEN AFTER WASHING IS FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT
EIGHTEEN SQUARE WITH A CEILING WHICH WAS FORMERLY PAINTED AND GILDED
AND WITH BEAMS AS IN YOURS
THIS WAS COVERED WITH A CLOTH WHILE THIS
WAS THE HOSPITAL
AND THE WOODWORK WAS OF THE ERA OF OUR GRANDMOTHERS
BUT MY ROOM IS THE ONE YOU OUGHT TO SEE
MADAM MAGLOIRE HAS DISCOVERED
UNDER AT LEAST TEN THICKNESSES OF PAPER PASTED ON TOP SOME PAINTINGS
WHICH WITHOUT BEING GOOD ARE VERY TOLERABLE
THE SUBJECT IS TELEMACHUS
BEING KNIGHTED BY MINERVA IN SOME GARDENS THE NAME OF WHICH ESCAPES
ME
IN SHORT WHERE THE ROMAN LADIES REPAIRED ON ONE SINGLE NIGHT
WHAT
SHALL I SAY TO YOU I HAVE ROMANS AND ROMAN LADIES HERE OCCURS AN
ILLEGIBLE WORD AND THE WHOLE TRAIN
MADAM MAGLOIRE HAS CLEANED IT ALL
OFF THIS SUMMER SHE IS GOING TO HAVE SOME SMALL INJURIES REPAIRED AND
THE WHOLE REVARNISHED AND MY CHAMBER WILL BE A REGULAR MUSEUM
SHE HAS
ALSO FOUND IN A CORNER OF THE ATTIC TWO WOODEN PIER TABLES OF ANCIENT
FASHION
THEY ASKED US TWO CROWNS OF SIX FRANCS EACH TO REGILD THEM BUT
IT IS MUCH BETTER TO GIVE THE MONEY TO THE POOR AND THEY ARE VERY UGLY
BESIDES AND I SHOULD MUCH PREFER A ROUND TABLE OF MAHOGANY
I AM ALWAYS VERY HAPPY
MY BROTHER IS SO GOOD
HE GIVES ALL HE HAS TO
THE POOR AND SICK
WE ARE VERY MUCH CRAMPED
THE COUNTRY IS TRYING IN
THE WINTER AND WE REALLY MUST DO SOMETHING FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED
WE ARE ALMOST COMFORTABLY LIGHTED AND WARMED
YOU SEE THAT THESE ARE
GREAT TREATS
MY BROTHER HAS WAYS OF HIS OWN
WHEN HE TALKS HE SAYS THAT A BISHOP
OUGHT TO BE SO
JUST IMAGINE THE DOOR OF OUR HOUSE IS NEVER FASTENED
WHOEVER CHOOSES TO ENTER FINDS HIMSELF AT ONCE IN MY BROTHER'S ROOM
HE
FEARS NOTHING EVEN AT NIGHT
THAT IS HIS SORT OF BRAVERY HE SAYS
HE DOES NOT WISH ME OR MADAME MAGLOIRE FEEL ANY FEAR FOR HIM
HE EXPOSES
HIMSELF TO ALL SORTS OF DANGERS AND HE DOES NOT LIKE TO HAVE US EVEN
SEEM TO NOTICE IT
ONE MUST KNOW HOW TO UNDERSTAND HIM
HE GOES OUT IN THE RAIN HE WALKS IN THE WATER HE TRAVELS IN WINTER
HE
FEARS NEITHER SUSPICIOUS ROADS NOR DANGEROUS ENCOUNTERS NOR NIGHT
LAST YEAR HE WENT QUITE ALONE INTO A COUNTRY OF ROBBERS
HE WOULD
NOT TAKE US
HE WAS ABSENT FOR A FORTNIGHT
ON HIS RETURN NOTHING HAD
HAPPENED TO HIM HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE DEAD BUT WAS PERFECTLY WELL AND
SAID THIS IS THE WAY I HAVE BEEN ROBBED AND THEN HE OPENED A TRUNK
FULL OF JEWELS ALL THE JEWELS OF THE CATHEDRAL OF EMBRUN WHICH THE
THIEVES HAD GIVEN HIM
WHEN HE RETURNED ON THAT OCCASION I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SCOLDING HIM
A LITTLE TAKING CARE HOWEVER NOT TO SPEAK EXCEPT WHEN THE CARRIAGE
WAS MAKING A NOISE SO THAT NO ONE MIGHT HEAR ME
AT FIRST I USED TO SAY TO MYSELF THERE ARE NO DANGERS WHICH WILL STOP
HIM HE IS TERRIBLE NOW I HAVE ENDED BY GETTING USED TO IT
I MAKE A
SIGN TO MADAM MAGLOIRE THAT SHE IS NOT TO OPPOSE HIM
HE RISKS HIMSELF
AS HE SEES FIT
I CARRY OFF MADAM MAGLOIRE I ENTER MY CHAMBER I PRAY
FOR HIM AND FALL ASLEEP
I AM AT EASE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IF ANYTHING
WERE TO HAPPEN TO HIM IT WOULD BE THE END OF ME
I SHOULD GO TO THE
GOOD GOD WITH MY BROTHER AND MY BISHOP
IT HAS COST MADAM MAGLOIRE
MORE TROUBLE THAN IT DID ME TO ACCUSTOM HERSELF TO WHAT SHE TERMS HIS
IMPRUDENCES
BUT NOW THE HABIT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED
WE PRAY TOGETHER WE
TREMBLE TOGETHER AND WE FALL ASLEEP
IF THE DEVIL WERE TO ENTER THIS
HOUSE HE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO SO
AFTER ALL WHAT IS THERE FOR US
TO FEAR IN THIS HOUSE THERE IS ALWAYS SOME ONE WITH US WHO IS STRONGER
THAN WE
THE DEVIL MAY PASS THROUGH IT BUT THE GOOD GOD DWELLS HERE
THIS SUFFICES ME
MY BROTHER HAS NO LONGER ANY NEED OF SAYING A WORD TO
ME
I UNDERSTAND HIM WITHOUT HIS SPEAKING AND WE ABANDON OURSELVES TO
THE CARE OF PROVIDENCE
THAT IS THE WAY ONE HAS TO DO WITH A MAN WHO
POSSESSES GRANDEUR OF SOUL
I HAVE INTERROGATED MY BROTHER WITH REGARD TO THE INFORMATION WHICH YOU
DESIRE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE FAUX FAMILY
YOU ARE AWARE THAT HE KNOWS
EVERYTHING AND THAT HE HAS MEMORIES BECAUSE HE IS STILL A VERY
GOOD ROYALIST
THEY REALLY ARE A VERY ANCIENT NORMAN FAMILY OF THE
GENERALSHIP OF CAEN
FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THERE WAS A RAOUL DE FAUX A
JEAN DE FAUX AND A THOMAS DE FAUX WHO WERE GENTLEMEN AND ONE OF WHOM
WAS A SEIGNEUR DE ROCHEFORT
THE LAST WAS GUY ETIENNE ALEXANDRE AND WAS
COMMANDER OF A REGIMENT AND SOMETHING IN THE LIGHT HORSE OF BRETAGNE
HIS DAUGHTER MARIE LOUISE MARRIED ADRIEN CHARLES DE GRAMONT SON OF
THE DUKE LOUIS DE GRAMONT PEER OF FRANCE COLONEL OF THE FRENCH GUARDS
AND LIEUTENANT GENERAL OF THE ARMY
IT IS WRITTEN FAUX FAUQ AND
FAOUCQ
GOOD MADAME RECOMMEND US TO THE PRAYERS OF YOUR SAINTED RELATIVE
MONSIEUR THE CARDINAL
AS FOR YOUR DEAR SYLVANIE SHE HAS DONE WELL IN
NOT WASTING THE FEW MOMENTS WHICH SHE PASSES WITH YOU IN WRITING TO ME
SHE IS WELL WORKS AS YOU WOULD WISH AND LOVES ME
THAT IS ALL THAT I DESIRE
THE SOUVENIR WHICH SHE SENT THROUGH YOU
REACHED ME SAFELY AND IT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY
MY HEALTH IS NOT SO VERY
BAD AND YET I GROW THINNER EVERY DAY
FAREWELL MY PAPER IS AT AN END
AND THIS FORCES ME TO LEAVE YOU
A THOUSAND GOOD WISHES
BAPTISTINE
P S
YOUR GRAND NEPHEW IS CHARMING
DO YOU KNOW THAT HE WILL SOON BE
FIVE YEARS OLD YESTERDAY HE SAW SOME ONE RIDING BY ON HORSEBACK WHO
HAD ON KNEE CAPS AND HE SAID WHAT HAS HE GOT ON HIS KNEES HE IS A
CHARMING CHILD HIS LITTLE BROTHER IS DRAGGING AN OLD BROOM ABOUT THE
ROOM LIKE A CARRIAGE AND SAYING HU
AS WILL BE PERCEIVED FROM THIS LETTER THESE TWO WOMEN UNDERSTOOD HOW TO
MOULD THEMSELVES TO THE BISHOP'S WAYS WITH THAT SPECIAL FEMININE GENIUS
WHICH COMPREHENDS THE MAN BETTER THAN HE COMPREHENDS HIMSELF
THE BISHOP
OF D IN SPITE OF THE GENTLE AND CANDID AIR WHICH NEVER DESERTED
HIM SOMETIMES DID THINGS THAT WERE GRAND BOLD AND MAGNIFICENT
WITHOUT SEEMING TO HAVE EVEN A SUSPICION OF THE FACT
THEY TREMBLED BUT
THEY LET HIM ALONE
SOMETIMES MADAME MAGLOIRE ESSAYED A REMONSTRANCE IN
ADVANCE BUT NEVER AT THE TIME NOR AFTERWARDS
THEY NEVER INTERFERED
WITH HIM BY SO MUCH AS A WORD OR SIGN IN ANY ACTION ONCE ENTERED UPON
AT CERTAIN MOMENTS WITHOUT HIS HAVING OCCASION TO MENTION IT WHEN HE
WAS NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS OF IT HIMSELF IN ALL PROBABILITY SO PERFECT WAS
HIS SIMPLICITY THEY VAGUELY FELT THAT HE WAS ACTING AS A BISHOP THEN
THEY WERE NOTHING MORE THAN TWO SHADOWS IN THE HOUSE
THEY SERVED HIM
PASSIVELY AND IF OBEDIENCE CONSISTED IN DISAPPEARING THEY DISAPPEARED
THEY UNDERSTOOD WITH AN ADMIRABLE DELICACY OF INSTINCT THAT CERTAIN
CARES MAY BE PUT UNDER CONSTRAINT
THUS EVEN WHEN BELIEVING HIM TO BE
IN PERIL THEY UNDERSTOOD I WILL NOT SAY HIS THOUGHT BUT HIS NATURE
TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THEY NO LONGER WATCHED OVER HIM
THEY CONFIDED HIM
TO GOD
MOREOVER BAPTISTINE SAID AS WE HAVE JUST READ THAT HER BROTHER'S END
WOULD PROVE HER OWN
MADAME MAGLOIRE DID NOT SAY THIS BUT SHE KNEW IT
CHAPTER X THE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT
AT AN EPOCH A LITTLE LATER THAN THE DATE OF THE LETTER CITED IN THE
PRECEDING PAGES HE DID A THING WHICH IF THE WHOLE TOWN WAS TO BE
BELIEVED WAS EVEN MORE HAZARDOUS THAN HIS TRIP ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS
INFESTED WITH BANDITS
IN THE COUNTRY NEAR D A MAN LIVED QUITE ALONE
THIS MAN WE WILL
STATE AT ONCE WAS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION
HIS NAME WAS G
MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION G WAS MENTIONED WITH A SORT OF HORROR IN
THE LITTLE WORLD OF D A MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION CAN YOU IMAGINE
SUCH A THING THAT EXISTED FROM THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE CALLED EACH OTHER
THOU AND WHEN THEY SAID CITIZEN THIS MAN WAS ALMOST A MONSTER
HE HAD NOT VOTED FOR THE DEATH OF THE KING BUT ALMOST
HE WAS A
QUASI REGICIDE
HE HAD BEEN A TERRIBLE MAN
HOW DID IT HAPPEN THAT SUCH
A MAN HAD NOT BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE A PROVOST'S COURT ON THE RETURN OF
THE LEGITIMATE PRINCES THEY NEED NOT HAVE CUT OFF HIS HEAD IF YOU
PLEASE CLEMENCY MUST BE EXERCISED AGREED BUT A GOOD BANISHMENT FOR
LIFE
AN EXAMPLE IN SHORT ETC
BESIDES HE WAS AN ATHEIST LIKE ALL
THE REST OF THOSE PEOPLE
GOSSIP OF THE GEESE ABOUT THE VULTURE
WAS G A VULTURE AFTER ALL YES IF HE WERE TO BE JUDGED BY THE
ELEMENT OF FEROCITY IN THIS SOLITUDE OF HIS
AS HE HAD NOT VOTED FOR THE
DEATH OF THE KING HE HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE DECREES OF EXILE AND
HAD BEEN ABLE TO REMAIN IN FRANCE
HE DWELT AT A DISTANCE OF THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR FROM THE CITY FAR
FROM ANY HAMLET FAR FROM ANY ROAD IN SOME HIDDEN TURN OF A VERY WILD
VALLEY NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE
HE HAD THERE IT WAS SAID A SORT
OF FIELD A HOLE A LAIR
THERE WERE NO NEIGHBORS NOT EVEN PASSERS BY
SINCE HE HAD DWELT IN THAT VALLEY THE PATH WHICH LED THITHER HAD
DISAPPEARED UNDER A GROWTH OF GRASS
THE LOCALITY WAS SPOKEN OF AS
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN THE DWELLING OF A HANGMAN
NEVERTHELESS THE BISHOP MEDITATED ON THE SUBJECT AND FROM TIME TO TIME
HE GAZED AT THE HORIZON AT A POINT WHERE A CLUMP OF TREES MARKED THE
VALLEY OF THE FORMER MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION AND HE SAID THERE IS A
SOUL YONDER WHICH IS LONELY
AND HE ADDED DEEP IN HIS OWN MIND I OWE HIM A VISIT
BUT LET US AVOW IT THIS IDEA WHICH SEEMED NATURAL AT THE FIRST BLUSH
APPEARED TO HIM AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION AS STRANGE IMPOSSIBLE AND
ALMOST REPULSIVE
FOR AT BOTTOM HE SHARED THE GENERAL IMPRESSION AND
THE OLD MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION INSPIRED HIM WITHOUT HIS BEING CLEARLY
CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT HIMSELF WITH THAT SENTIMENT WHICH BORDERS ON
HATE AND WHICH IS SO WELL EXPRESSED BY THE WORD ESTRANGEMENT
STILL SHOULD THE SCAB OF THE SHEEP CAUSE THE SHEPHERD TO RECOIL NO
BUT WHAT A SHEEP
THE GOOD BISHOP WAS PERPLEXED
SOMETIMES HE SET OUT IN THAT DIRECTION
THEN HE RETURNED
FINALLY THE RUMOR ONE DAY SPREAD THROUGH THE TOWN THAT A SORT OF YOUNG
SHEPHERD WHO SERVED THE MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION IN HIS HOVEL HAD COME
IN QUEST OF A DOCTOR THAT THE OLD WRETCH WAS DYING THAT PARALYSIS WAS
GAINING ON HIM AND THAT HE WOULD NOT LIVE OVER NIGHT THANK GOD
SOME ADDED
THE BISHOP TOOK HIS STAFF PUT ON HIS CLOAK ON ACCOUNT OF HIS TOO
THREADBARE CASSOCK AS WE HAVE MENTIONED AND BECAUSE OF THE EVENING
BREEZE WHICH WAS SURE TO RISE SOON AND SET OUT
THE SUN WAS SETTING AND HAD ALMOST TOUCHED THE HORIZON WHEN THE BISHOP
ARRIVED AT THE EXCOMMUNICATED SPOT
WITH A CERTAIN BEATING OF THE HEART
HE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT HE WAS NEAR THE LAIR
HE STRODE OVER A
DITCH LEAPED A HEDGE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH A FENCE OF DEAD BOUGHS
ENTERED A NEGLECTED PADDOCK TOOK A FEW STEPS WITH A GOOD DEAL OF
BOLDNESS AND SUDDENLY AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE WASTE LAND AND BEHIND
LOFTY BRAMBLES HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE CAVERN
IT WAS A VERY LOW HUT POOR SMALL AND CLEAN WITH A VINE NAILED
AGAINST THE OUTSIDE
NEAR THE DOOR IN AN OLD WHEEL CHAIR THE ARM CHAIR OF THE PEASANTS
THERE WAS A WHITE HAIRED MAN SMILING AT THE SUN
NEAR THE SEATED MAN STOOD A YOUNG BOY THE SHEPHERD LAD
HE WAS OFFERING
THE OLD MAN A JAR OF MILK
WHILE THE BISHOP WAS WATCHING HIM THE OLD MAN SPOKE THANK YOU HE
SAID I NEED NOTHING AND HIS SMILE QUITTED THE SUN TO REST UPON THE
CHILD
THE BISHOP STEPPED FORWARD
AT THE SOUND WHICH HE MADE IN WALKING THE
OLD MAN TURNED HIS HEAD AND HIS FACE EXPRESSED THE SUM TOTAL OF THE
SURPRISE WHICH A MAN CAN STILL FEEL AFTER A LONG LIFE
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE SAID HE THAT ANY ONE
HAS ENTERED HERE
WHO ARE YOU SIR
THE BISHOP ANSWERED
MY NAME IS BIENVENU MYRIEL
BIENVENU MYRIEL I HAVE HEARD THAT NAME
ARE YOU THE MAN WHOM THE
PEOPLE CALL MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME
I AM
THE OLD MAN RESUMED WITH A HALF SMILE
IN THAT CASE YOU ARE MY BISHOP
SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
ENTER SIR
THE MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION EXTENDED HIS HAND TO THE BISHOP BUT THE
BISHOP DID NOT TAKE IT
THE BISHOP CONFINED HIMSELF TO THE REMARK
I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT I HAVE BEEN MISINFORMED
YOU CERTAINLY DO NOT
SEEM TO ME TO BE ILL
MONSIEUR REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AM GOING TO RECOVER
HE PAUSED AND THEN SAID
I SHALL DIE THREE HOURS HENCE
THEN HE CONTINUED
I AM SOMETHING OF A DOCTOR I KNOW IN WHAT FASHION THE LAST HOUR DRAWS
ON
YESTERDAY ONLY MY FEET WERE COLD TO DAY THE CHILL HAS ASCENDED TO
MY KNEES NOW I FEEL IT MOUNTING TO MY WAIST WHEN IT REACHES THE HEART
I SHALL STOP
THE SUN IS BEAUTIFUL IS IT NOT I HAD MYSELF WHEELED
OUT HERE TO TAKE A LAST LOOK AT THINGS
YOU CAN TALK TO ME IT DOES NOT
FATIGUE ME
YOU HAVE DONE WELL TO COME AND LOOK AT A MAN WHO IS ON
THE POINT OF DEATH
IT IS WELL THAT THERE SHOULD BE WITNESSES AT THAT
MOMENT
ONE HAS ONE'S CAPRICES I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO LAST UNTIL THE
DAWN BUT I KNOW THAT I SHALL HARDLY LIVE THREE HOURS
IT WILL BE NIGHT
THEN
WHAT DOES IT MATTER AFTER ALL DYING IS A SIMPLE AFFAIR
ONE HAS
NO NEED OF THE LIGHT FOR THAT
SO BE IT
I SHALL DIE BY STARLIGHT
THE OLD MAN TURNED TO THE SHEPHERD LAD
GO TO THY BED THOU WERT AWAKE ALL LAST NIGHT THOU ART TIRED
THE CHILD ENTERED THE HUT
THE OLD MAN FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES AND ADDED AS THOUGH SPEAKING TO
HIMSELF
I SHALL DIE WHILE HE SLEEPS
THE TWO SLUMBERS MAY BE GOOD NEIGHBORS
THE BISHOP WAS NOT TOUCHED AS IT SEEMS THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
HE
DID NOT THINK HE DISCERNED GOD IN THIS MANNER OF DYING LET US SAY THE
WHOLE FOR THESE PETTY CONTRADICTIONS OF GREAT HEARTS MUST BE INDICATED
LIKE THE REST HE WHO ON OCCASION WAS SO FOND OF LAUGHING AT HIS
GRACE WAS RATHER SHOCKED AT NOT BEING ADDRESSED AS MONSEIGNEUR AND HE
WAS ALMOST TEMPTED TO RETORT CITIZEN HE WAS ASSAILED BY A FANCY FOR
PEEVISH FAMILIARITY COMMON ENOUGH TO DOCTORS AND PRIESTS BUT WHICH
WAS NOT HABITUAL WITH HIM
THIS MAN AFTER ALL THIS MEMBER OF THE
CONVENTION THIS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE
POWERFUL ONES OF THE EARTH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE PROBABLY
THE BISHOP FELT IN A MOOD TO BE SEVERE
MEANWHILE THE MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION HAD BEEN SURVEYING HIM WITH A
MODEST CORDIALITY IN WHICH ONE COULD HAVE DISTINGUISHED POSSIBLY THAT
HUMILITY WHICH IS SO FITTING WHEN ONE IS ON THE VERGE OF RETURNING TO
DUST
THE BISHOP ON HIS SIDE ALTHOUGH HE GENERALLY RESTRAINED HIS CURIOSITY
WHICH IN HIS OPINION BORDERED ON A FAULT COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM
EXAMINING THE MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION WITH AN ATTENTION WHICH AS IT
DID NOT HAVE ITS COURSE IN SYMPATHY WOULD HAVE SERVED HIS CONSCIENCE AS
A MATTER OF REPROACH IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER MAN
A MEMBER OF THE
CONVENTION PRODUCED ON HIM SOMEWHAT THE EFFECT OF BEING OUTSIDE THE PALE
OF THE LAW EVEN OF THE LAW OF CHARITY
G CALM HIS BODY ALMOST
UPRIGHT HIS VOICE VIBRATING WAS ONE OF THOSE OCTOGENARIANS WHO FORM
THE SUBJECT OF ASTONISHMENT TO THE PHYSIOLOGIST
THE REVOLUTION HAD
MANY OF THESE MEN PROPORTIONED TO THE EPOCH
IN THIS OLD MAN ONE WAS
CONSCIOUS OF A MAN PUT TO THE PROOF
THOUGH SO NEAR TO HIS END HE
PRESERVED ALL THE GESTURES OF HEALTH
IN HIS CLEAR GLANCE IN HIS FIRM
TONE IN THE ROBUST MOVEMENT OF HIS SHOULDERS THERE WAS SOMETHING
CALCULATED TO DISCONCERT DEATH
AZRAEL THE MOHAMMEDAN ANGEL OF THE
SEPULCHRE WOULD HAVE TURNED BACK AND THOUGHT THAT HE HAD MISTAKEN
THE DOOR
G SEEMED TO BE DYING BECAUSE HE WILLED IT SO
THERE WAS
FREEDOM IN HIS AGONY
HIS LEGS ALONE WERE MOTIONLESS
IT WAS THERE THAT
THE SHADOWS HELD HIM FAST
HIS FEET WERE COLD AND DEAD BUT HIS HEAD
SURVIVED WITH ALL THE POWER OF LIFE AND SEEMED FULL OF LIGHT
G
AT THIS SOLEMN MOMENT RESEMBLED THE KING IN THAT TALE OF THE ORIENT WHO
WAS FLESH ABOVE AND MARBLE BELOW
THERE WAS A STONE THERE
THE BISHOP SAT DOWN
THE EXORDIUM WAS ABRUPT
I CONGRATULATE YOU SAID HE IN THE TONE WHICH ONE USES FOR A
REPRIMAND
YOU DID NOT VOTE FOR THE DEATH OF THE KING AFTER ALL
THE OLD MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION DID NOT APPEAR TO NOTICE THE BITTER
MEANING UNDERLYING THE WORDS AFTER ALL HE REPLIED
THE SMILE HAD
QUITE DISAPPEARED FROM HIS FACE
DO NOT CONGRATULATE ME TOO MUCH SIR
I DID VOTE FOR THE DEATH OF THE
TYRANT
IT WAS THE TONE OF AUSTERITY ANSWERING THE TONE OF SEVERITY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY RESUMED THE BISHOP
I MEAN TO SAY THAT MAN HAS A TYRANT IGNORANCE
I VOTED FOR THE DEATH
OF THAT TYRANT
THAT TYRANT ENGENDERED ROYALTY WHICH IS AUTHORITY
FALSELY UNDERSTOOD WHILE SCIENCE IS AUTHORITY RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD
MAN
SHOULD BE GOVERNED ONLY BY SCIENCE
AND CONSCIENCE ADDED THE BISHOP
IT IS THE SAME THING
CONSCIENCE IS THE QUANTITY OF INNATE SCIENCE
WHICH WE HAVE WITHIN US
MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU LISTENED IN SOME ASTONISHMENT TO THIS LANGUAGE
WHICH WAS VERY NEW TO HIM
THE MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION RESUMED
SO FAR AS LOUIS XVI
WAS CONCERNED I SAID 'NO I DID NOT THINK THAT I
HAD THE RIGHT TO KILL A MAN BUT I FELT IT MY DUTY TO EXTERMINATE EVIL
I VOTED THE END OF THE TYRANT THAT IS TO SAY THE END OF PROSTITUTION
FOR WOMAN THE END OF SLAVERY FOR MAN THE END OF NIGHT FOR THE CHILD
IN VOTING FOR THE REPUBLIC I VOTED FOR THAT
I VOTED FOR FRATERNITY
CONCORD THE DAWN
I HAVE AIDED IN THE OVERTHROW OF PREJUDICES AND
ERRORS
THE CRUMBLING AWAY OF PREJUDICES AND ERRORS CAUSES LIGHT
WE
HAVE CAUSED THE FALL OF THE OLD WORLD AND THE OLD WORLD THAT VASE OF
MISERIES HAS BECOME THROUGH ITS UPSETTING UPON THE HUMAN RACE AN URN
OF JOY
MIXED JOY SAID THE BISHOP
YOU MAY SAY TROUBLED JOY AND TO DAY AFTER THAT FATAL RETURN OF THE
PAST WHICH IS CALLED 1814 JOY WHICH HAS DISAPPEARED ALAS THE WORK
WAS INCOMPLETE I ADMIT WE DEMOLISHED THE ANCIENT REGIME IN DEEDS WE
WERE NOT ABLE TO SUPPRESS IT ENTIRELY IN IDEAS
TO DESTROY ABUSES IS NOT
SUFFICIENT CUSTOMS MUST BE MODIFIED
THE MILL IS THERE NO LONGER THE
WIND IS STILL THERE
YOU HAVE DEMOLISHED
IT MAY BE OF USE TO DEMOLISH BUT I DISTRUST A
DEMOLITION COMPLICATED WITH WRATH
RIGHT HAS ITS WRATH BISHOP AND THE WRATH OF RIGHT IS AN ELEMENT OF
PROGRESS
IN ANY CASE AND IN SPITE OF WHATEVER MAY BE SAID THE FRENCH
REVOLUTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP OF THE HUMAN RACE SINCE THE ADVENT
OF CHRIST
INCOMPLETE IT MAY BE BUT SUBLIME
IT SET FREE ALL THE
UNKNOWN SOCIAL QUANTITIES IT SOFTENED SPIRITS IT CALMED APPEASED
ENLIGHTENED IT CAUSED THE WAVES OF CIVILIZATION TO FLOW OVER THE
EARTH
IT WAS A GOOD THING
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION IS THE CONSECRATION OF
HUMANITY
THE BISHOP COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM MURMURING
YES '93
THE MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP IN HIS CHAIR WITH
AN ALMOST LUGUBRIOUS SOLEMNITY AND EXCLAIMED SO FAR AS A DYING MAN IS
CAPABLE OF EXCLAMATION
AH THERE YOU GO '93 I WAS EXPECTING THAT WORD
A CLOUD HAD BEEN
FORMING FOR THE SPACE OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AT THE END OF FIFTEEN
HUNDRED YEARS IT BURST
YOU ARE PUTTING THE THUNDERBOLT ON ITS TRIAL
THE BISHOP FELT WITHOUT PERHAPS CONFESSING IT THAT SOMETHING WITHIN
HIM HAD SUFFERED EXTINCTION
NEVERTHELESS HE PUT A GOOD FACE ON THE
MATTER
HE REPLIED
THE JUDGE SPEAKS IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE THE PRIEST SPEAKS IN THE NAME
OF PITY WHICH IS NOTHING BUT A MORE LOFTY JUSTICE
A THUNDERBOLT SHOULD
COMMIT NO ERROR AND HE ADDED REGARDING THE MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION
STEADILY THE WHILE LOUIS XVII
THE CONVENTIONARY STRETCHED FORTH HIS HAND AND GRASPED THE BISHOP'S ARM
LOUIS XVII LET US SEE
FOR WHOM DO YOU MOURN IS IT FOR THE INNOCENT
CHILD VERY GOOD IN THAT CASE I MOURN WITH YOU
IS IT FOR THE ROYAL
CHILD I DEMAND TIME FOR REFLECTION
TO ME THE BROTHER OF CARTOUCHE
AN INNOCENT CHILD WHO WAS HUNG UP BY THE ARMPITS IN THE PLACE DE GREVE
UNTIL DEATH ENSUED FOR THE SOLE CRIME OF HAVING BEEN THE BROTHER
OF CARTOUCHE IS NO LESS PAINFUL THAN THE GRANDSON OF LOUIS XV AN
INNOCENT CHILD MARTYRED IN THE TOWER OF THE TEMPLE FOR THE SOLE CRIME
OF HAVING BEEN GRANDSON OF LOUIS XV
MONSIEUR SAID THE BISHOP I LIKE NOT THIS CONJUNCTION OF NAMES
CARTOUCHE LOUIS XV TO WHICH OF THE TWO DO YOU OBJECT
A MOMENTARY SILENCE ENSUED
THE BISHOP ALMOST REGRETTED HAVING COME AND
YET HE FELT VAGUELY AND STRANGELY SHAKEN
THE CONVENTIONARY RESUMED
AH MONSIEUR PRIEST YOU LOVE NOT THE CRUDITIES OF THE TRUE
CHRIST
LOVED THEM
HE SEIZED A ROD AND CLEARED OUT THE TEMPLE
HIS SCOURGE
FULL OF LIGHTNINGS WAS A HARSH SPEAKER OF TRUTHS
WHEN HE CRIED
'SINITE PARVULOS HE MADE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LITTLE CHILDREN
IT WOULD NOT HAVE EMBARRASSED HIM TO BRING TOGETHER THE DAUPHIN OF
BARABBAS AND THE DAUPHIN OF HEROD
INNOCENCE MONSIEUR IS ITS OWN
CROWN
INNOCENCE HAS NO NEED TO BE A HIGHNESS
IT IS AS AUGUST IN RAGS
AS IN FLEURS DE LYS
THAT IS TRUE SAID THE BISHOP IN A LOW VOICE
I PERSIST CONTINUED THE CONVENTIONARY G YOU HAVE MENTIONED LOUIS
XVII
TO ME
LET US COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING
SHALL WE WEEP FOR ALL THE
INNOCENT ALL MARTYRS ALL CHILDREN THE LOWLY AS WELL AS THE EXALTED
I AGREE TO THAT
BUT IN THAT CASE AS I HAVE TOLD YOU WE MUST GO BACK
FURTHER THAN '93 AND OUR TEARS MUST BEGIN BEFORE LOUIS XVII
I WILL
WEEP WITH YOU OVER THE CHILDREN OF KINGS PROVIDED THAT YOU WILL WEEP
WITH ME OVER THE CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE
I WEEP FOR ALL SAID THE BISHOP
EQUALLY EXCLAIMED CONVENTIONARY G AND IF THE BALANCE MUST
INCLINE LET IT BE ON THE SIDE OF THE PEOPLE
THEY HAVE BEEN SUFFERING
LONGER
ANOTHER SILENCE ENSUED
THE CONVENTIONARY WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK IT
HE
RAISED HIMSELF ON ONE ELBOW TOOK A BIT OF HIS CHEEK BETWEEN HIS THUMB
AND HIS FOREFINGER AS ONE DOES MECHANICALLY WHEN ONE INTERROGATES AND
JUDGES AND APPEALED TO THE BISHOP WITH A GAZE FULL OF ALL THE FORCES OF
THE DEATH AGONY
IT WAS ALMOST AN EXPLOSION
YES SIR THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUFFERING A LONG WHILE
AND HOLD THAT
IS NOT ALL EITHER WHY HAVE YOU JUST QUESTIONED ME AND TALKED TO ME
ABOUT LOUIS XVII I KNOW YOU NOT
EVER SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN THESE PARTS
I HAVE DWELT IN THIS ENCLOSURE ALONE NEVER SETTING FOOT OUTSIDE AND
SEEING NO ONE BUT THAT CHILD WHO HELPS ME
YOUR NAME HAS REACHED ME IN
A CONFUSED MANNER IT IS TRUE AND VERY BADLY PRONOUNCED I MUST ADMIT
BUT THAT SIGNIFIES NOTHING CLEVER MEN HAVE SO MANY WAYS OF IMPOSING ON
THAT HONEST GOODMAN THE PEOPLE
BY THE WAY I DID NOT HEAR THE SOUND OF
YOUR CARRIAGE YOU HAVE LEFT IT YONDER BEHIND THE COPPICE AT THE FORK
OF THE ROADS NO DOUBT
I DO NOT KNOW YOU I TELL YOU
YOU HAVE TOLD ME
THAT YOU ARE THE BISHOP BUT THAT AFFORDS ME NO INFORMATION AS TO YOUR
MORAL PERSONALITY
IN SHORT I REPEAT MY QUESTION
WHO ARE YOU YOU ARE
A BISHOP THAT IS TO SAY A PRINCE OF THE CHURCH ONE OF THOSE GILDED
MEN WITH HERALDIC BEARINGS AND REVENUES WHO HAVE VAST PREBENDS THE
BISHOPRIC OF D FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS SETTLED INCOME TEN THOUSAND
IN PERQUISITES TOTAL TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS WHO HAVE KITCHENS
WHO HAVE LIVERIES WHO MAKE GOOD CHEER WHO EAT MOOR HENS ON FRIDAY WHO
STRUT ABOUT A LACKEY BEFORE A LACKEY BEHIND IN A GALA COACH AND
WHO HAVE PALACES AND WHO ROLL IN THEIR CARRIAGES IN THE NAME OF JESUS
CHRIST WHO WENT BAREFOOT YOU ARE A PRELATE REVENUES PALACE HORSES
SERVANTS GOOD TABLE ALL THE SENSUALITIES OF LIFE YOU HAVE THIS LIKE
THE REST AND LIKE THE REST YOU ENJOY IT IT IS WELL BUT THIS SAYS
EITHER TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE THIS DOES NOT ENLIGHTEN ME UPON THE
INTRINSIC AND ESSENTIAL VALUE OF THE MAN WHO COMES WITH THE PROBABLE
INTENTION OF BRINGING WISDOM TO ME
TO WHOM DO I SPEAK WHO ARE YOU
THE BISHOP HUNG HIS HEAD AND REPLIED VERMIS SUM I AM A WORM
A WORM OF THE EARTH IN A CARRIAGE GROWLED THE CONVENTIONARY
IT WAS THE CONVENTIONARY'S TURN TO BE ARROGANT AND THE BISHOP'S TO BE
HUMBLE
THE BISHOP RESUMED MILDLY
SO BE IT SIR
BUT EXPLAIN TO ME HOW MY CARRIAGE WHICH IS A FEW PACES
OFF BEHIND THE TREES YONDER HOW MY GOOD TABLE AND THE MOOR HENS WHICH I
EAT ON FRIDAY HOW MY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS INCOME HOW MY PALACE
AND MY LACKEYS PROVE THAT CLEMENCY IS NOT A DUTY AND THAT '93 WAS NOT
INEXORABLE
THE CONVENTIONARY PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS BROW AS THOUGH TO SWEEP
AWAY A CLOUD
BEFORE REPLYING TO YOU HE SAID I BESEECH YOU TO PARDON ME
I HAVE
JUST COMMITTED A WRONG SIR
YOU ARE AT MY HOUSE YOU ARE MY GUEST I
OWE YOU COURTESY
YOU DISCUSS MY IDEAS AND IT BECOMES ME TO CONFINE
MYSELF TO COMBATING YOUR ARGUMENTS
YOUR RICHES AND YOUR PLEASURES ARE
ADVANTAGES WHICH I HOLD OVER YOU IN THE DEBATE BUT GOOD TASTE DICTATES
THAT I SHALL NOT MAKE USE OF THEM
I PROMISE YOU TO MAKE NO USE OF THEM
IN THE FUTURE
I THANK YOU SAID THE BISHOP
G RESUMED
LET US RETURN TO THE EXPLANATION WHICH YOU HAVE ASKED OF ME
WHERE WERE
WE WHAT WERE YOU SAYING TO ME THAT '93 WAS INEXORABLE
INEXORABLE YES SAID THE BISHOP
WHAT THINK YOU OF MARAT CLAPPING
HIS HANDS AT THE GUILLOTINE
WHAT THINK YOU OF BOSSUET CHANTING THE TE DEUM OVER THE DRAGONNADES
THE RETORT WAS A HARSH ONE BUT IT ATTAINED ITS MARK WITH THE DIRECTNESS
OF A POINT OF STEEL
THE BISHOP QUIVERED UNDER IT NO REPLY OCCURRED TO
HIM BUT HE WAS OFFENDED BY THIS MODE OF ALLUDING TO BOSSUET
THE BEST
OF MINDS WILL HAVE THEIR FETICHES AND THEY SOMETIMES FEEL VAGUELY
WOUNDED BY THE WANT OF RESPECT OF LOGIC
THE CONVENTIONARY BEGAN TO PANT THE ASTHMA OF THE AGONY WHICH IS
MINGLED WITH THE LAST BREATHS INTERRUPTED HIS VOICE STILL THERE WAS A
PERFECT LUCIDITY OF SOUL IN HIS EYES
HE WENT ON
LET ME SAY A FEW WORDS MORE IN THIS AND THAT DIRECTION I AM WILLING
APART FROM THE REVOLUTION WHICH TAKEN AS A WHOLE IS AN IMMENSE HUMAN
AFFIRMATION '93 IS ALAS A REJOINDER
YOU THINK IT INEXORABLE SIR
BUT WHAT OF THE WHOLE MONARCHY SIR CARRIER IS A BANDIT BUT WHAT NAME
DO YOU GIVE TO MONTREVEL FOUQUIER TAINVILLE IS A RASCAL BUT WHAT
IS YOUR OPINION AS TO LAMOIGNON BAVILLE MAILLARD IS TERRIBLE BUT
SAULX TAVANNES IF YOU PLEASE DUCHENE SENIOR IS FEROCIOUS BUT WHAT
EPITHET WILL YOU ALLOW ME FOR THE ELDER LETELLIER JOURDAN COUPE TETE
IS A MONSTER BUT NOT SO GREAT A ONE AS M
THE MARQUIS DE LOUVOIS
SIR
SIR I AM SORRY FOR MARIE ANTOINETTE ARCHDUCHESS AND QUEEN BUT I AM
ALSO SORRY FOR THAT POOR HUGUENOT WOMAN WHO IN 1685 UNDER LOUIS THE
GREAT SIR WHILE WITH A NURSING INFANT WAS BOUND NAKED TO THE WAIST
TO A STAKE AND THE CHILD KEPT AT A DISTANCE HER BREAST SWELLED WITH
MILK AND HER HEART WITH ANGUISH THE LITTLE ONE HUNGRY AND PALE BEHELD
THAT BREAST AND CRIED AND AGONIZED THE EXECUTIONER SAID TO THE WOMAN A
MOTHER AND A NURSE 'ABJURE GIVING HER HER CHOICE BETWEEN THE DEATH OF
HER INFANT AND THE DEATH OF HER CONSCIENCE
WHAT SAY YOU TO THAT TORTURE
OF TANTALUS AS APPLIED TO A MOTHER BEAR THIS WELL IN MIND SIR THE
FRENCH REVOLUTION HAD ITS REASONS FOR EXISTENCE ITS WRATH WILL BE
ABSOLVED BY THE FUTURE ITS RESULT IS THE WORLD MADE BETTER
FROM ITS
MOST TERRIBLE BLOWS THERE COMES FORTH A CARESS FOR THE HUMAN RACE
I
ABRIDGE I STOP I HAVE TOO MUCH THE ADVANTAGE MOREOVER I AM DYING
AND CEASING TO GAZE AT THE BISHOP THE CONVENTIONARY CONCLUDED HIS
THOUGHTS IN THESE TRANQUIL WORDS
YES THE BRUTALITIES OF PROGRESS ARE CALLED REVOLUTIONS
WHEN THEY ARE
OVER THIS FACT IS RECOGNIZED THAT THE HUMAN RACE HAS BEEN TREATED
HARSHLY BUT THAT IT HAS PROGRESSED
THE CONVENTIONARY DOUBTED NOT THAT HE HAD SUCCESSIVELY CONQUERED ALL THE
INMOST INTRENCHMENTS OF THE BISHOP
ONE REMAINED HOWEVER AND FROM THIS
INTRENCHMENT THE LAST RESOURCE OF MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU'S RESISTANCE
CAME FORTH THIS REPLY WHEREIN APPEARED NEARLY ALL THE HARSHNESS OF THE
BEGINNING
PROGRESS SHOULD BELIEVE IN GOD
GOOD CANNOT HAVE AN IMPIOUS SERVITOR
HE WHO IS AN ATHEIST IS BUT A BAD LEADER FOR THE HUMAN RACE
THE FORMER REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE MADE NO REPLY
HE WAS SEIZED
WITH A FIT OF TREMBLING
HE LOOKED TOWARDS HEAVEN AND IN HIS GLANCE A
TEAR GATHERED SLOWLY
WHEN THE EYELID WAS FULL THE TEAR TRICKLED DOWN
HIS LIVID CHEEK AND HE SAID ALMOST IN A STAMMER QUITE LOW AND TO
HIMSELF WHILE HIS EYES WERE PLUNGED IN THE DEPTHS
O THOU O IDEAL THOU ALONE EXISTEST
THE BISHOP EXPERIENCED AN INDESCRIBABLE SHOCK
AFTER A PAUSE THE OLD MAN RAISED A FINGER HEAVENWARD AND SAID
THE INFINITE IS
HE IS THERE
IF THE INFINITE HAD NO PERSON PERSON
WOULD BE WITHOUT LIMIT IT WOULD NOT BE INFINITE IN OTHER WORDS IT
WOULD NOT EXIST
THERE IS THEN AN I
THAT I OF THE INFINITE IS
GOD
THE DYING MAN HAD PRONOUNCED THESE LAST WORDS IN A LOUD VOICE AND WITH
THE SHIVER OF ECSTASY AS THOUGH HE BEHELD SOME ONE
WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN
HIS EYES CLOSED
THE EFFORT HAD EXHAUSTED HIM
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE
HAD JUST LIVED THROUGH IN A MOMENT THE FEW HOURS WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT TO
HIM
THAT WHICH HE HAD SAID BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIM WHO IS IN DEATH
THE SUPREME MOMENT WAS APPROACHING
THE BISHOP UNDERSTOOD THIS TIME PRESSED IT WAS AS A PRIEST THAT HE HAD
COME FROM EXTREME COLDNESS HE HAD PASSED BY DEGREES TO EXTREME EMOTION
HE GAZED AT THOSE CLOSED EYES HE TOOK THAT WRINKLED AGED AND ICE COLD
HAND IN HIS AND BENT OVER THE DYING MAN
THIS HOUR IS THE HOUR OF GOD
DO YOU NOT THINK THAT IT WOULD BE
REGRETTABLE IF WE HAD MET IN VAIN
THE CONVENTIONARY OPENED HIS EYES AGAIN
A GRAVITY MINGLED WITH GLOOM
WAS IMPRINTED ON HIS COUNTENANCE
BISHOP SAID HE WITH A SLOWNESS WHICH PROBABLY AROSE MORE FROM HIS
DIGNITY OF SOUL THAN FROM THE FAILING OF HIS STRENGTH I HAVE PASSED MY
LIFE IN MEDITATION STUDY AND CONTEMPLATION
I WAS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE
WHEN MY COUNTRY CALLED ME AND COMMANDED ME TO CONCERN MYSELF WITH ITS
AFFAIRS
I OBEYED
ABUSES EXISTED I COMBATED THEM TYRANNIES EXISTED
I DESTROYED THEM RIGHTS AND PRINCIPLES EXISTED I PROCLAIMED AND
CONFESSED THEM
OUR TERRITORY WAS INVADED I DEFENDED IT FRANCE WAS
MENACED I OFFERED MY BREAST
I WAS NOT RICH I AM POOR
I HAVE BEEN ONE
OF THE MASTERS OF THE STATE THE VAULTS OF THE TREASURY WERE ENCUMBERED
WITH SPECIE TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT WE WERE FORCED TO SHORE UP THE WALLS
WHICH WERE ON THE POINT OF BURSTING BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF GOLD AND
SILVER I DINED IN DEAD TREE STREET AT TWENTY TWO SOUS
I HAVE SUCCORED
THE OPPRESSED I HAVE COMFORTED THE SUFFERING
I TORE THE CLOTH FROM
THE ALTAR IT IS TRUE BUT IT WAS TO BIND UP THE WOUNDS OF MY COUNTRY
I
HAVE ALWAYS UPHELD THE MARCH FORWARD OF THE HUMAN RACE FORWARD TOWARDS
THE LIGHT AND I HAVE SOMETIMES RESISTED PROGRESS WITHOUT PITY
I HAVE
WHEN THE OCCASION OFFERED PROTECTED MY OWN ADVERSARIES MEN OF YOUR
PROFESSION
AND THERE IS AT PETEGHEM IN FLANDERS AT THE VERY SPOT
WHERE THE MEROVINGIAN KINGS HAD THEIR SUMMER PALACE A CONVENT OF
URBANISTS THE ABBEY OF SAINTE CLAIRE EN BEAULIEU WHICH I SAVED IN
1793
I HAVE DONE MY DUTY ACCORDING TO MY POWERS AND ALL THE GOOD
THAT I WAS ABLE
AFTER WHICH I WAS HUNTED DOWN PURSUED PERSECUTED
BLACKENED JEERED AT SCORNED CURSED PROSCRIBED
FOR MANY YEARS PAST
I WITH MY WHITE HAIR HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS THAT MANY PEOPLE THINK THEY
HAVE THE RIGHT TO DESPISE ME TO THE POOR IGNORANT MASSES I PRESENT THE
VISAGE OF ONE DAMNED
AND I ACCEPT THIS ISOLATION OF HATRED WITHOUT
HATING ANY ONE MYSELF
NOW I AM EIGHTY SIX YEARS OLD I AM ON THE POINT
OF DEATH
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE COME TO ASK OF ME
YOUR BLESSING SAID THE BISHOP
AND HE KNELT DOWN
WHEN THE BISHOP RAISED HIS HEAD AGAIN THE FACE OF THE CONVENTIONARY HAD
BECOME AUGUST
HE HAD JUST EXPIRED
THE BISHOP RETURNED HOME DEEPLY ABSORBED IN THOUGHTS WHICH CANNOT
BE KNOWN TO US
HE PASSED THE WHOLE NIGHT IN PRAYER
ON THE FOLLOWING
MORNING SOME BOLD AND CURIOUS PERSONS ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT
MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION G HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH POINTING
HEAVENWARD
FROM THAT MOMENT HE REDOUBLED HIS TENDERNESS AND BROTHERLY FEELING
TOWARDS ALL CHILDREN AND SUFFERERS
ANY ALLUSION TO THAT OLD WRETCH OF A G CAUSED HIM TO FALL INTO A
SINGULAR PREOCCUPATION
NO ONE COULD SAY THAT THE PASSAGE OF THAT SOUL
BEFORE HIS AND THE REFLECTION OF THAT GRAND CONSCIENCE UPON HIS DID
NOT COUNT FOR SOMETHING IN HIS APPROACH TO PERFECTION
THIS PASTORAL VISIT NATURALLY FURNISHED AN OCCASION FOR A MURMUR OF
COMMENT IN ALL THE LITTLE LOCAL COTERIES
WAS THE BEDSIDE OF SUCH A DYING MAN AS THAT THE PROPER PLACE FOR A
BISHOP THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NO CONVERSION TO BE EXPECTED
ALL THOSE
REVOLUTIONISTS ARE BACKSLIDERS
THEN WHY GO THERE WHAT WAS THERE TO BE
SEEN THERE HE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY CURIOUS INDEED TO SEE A SOUL CARRIED
OFF BY THE DEVIL
ONE DAY A DOWAGER OF THE IMPERTINENT VARIETY WHO THINKS HERSELF
SPIRITUAL ADDRESSED THIS SALLY TO HIM MONSEIGNEUR PEOPLE ARE
INQUIRING WHEN YOUR GREATNESS WILL RECEIVE THE RED CAP OH OH
THAT'S A COARSE COLOR REPLIED THE BISHOP
IT IS LUCKY THAT THOSE WHO
DESPISE IT IN A CAP REVERE IT IN A HAT
CHAPTER XI A RESTRICTION
WE SHOULD INCUR A GREAT RISK OF DECEIVING OURSELVES WERE WE TO CONCLUDE
FROM THIS THAT MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME WAS A PHILOSOPHICAL BISHOP OR A
PATRIOTIC CURE HIS MEETING WHICH MAY ALMOST BE DESIGNATED AS HIS
UNION WITH CONVENTIONARY G LEFT BEHIND IT IN HIS MIND A SORT OF
ASTONISHMENT WHICH RENDERED HIM STILL MORE GENTLE
THAT IS ALL
ALTHOUGH MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU WAS FAR FROM BEING A POLITICIAN THIS IS
PERHAPS THE PLACE TO INDICATE VERY BRIEFLY WHAT HIS ATTITUDE WAS IN THE
EVENTS OF THAT EPOCH SUPPOSING THAT MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU EVER DREAMED
OF HAVING AN ATTITUDE
LET US THEN GO BACK A FEW YEARS
SOME TIME AFTER THE ELEVATION OF M
MYRIEL TO THE EPISCOPATE THE
EMPEROR HAD MADE HIM A BARON OF THE EMPIRE IN COMPANY WITH MANY OTHER
BISHOPS
THE ARREST OF THE POPE TOOK PLACE AS EVERY ONE KNOWS ON THE
NIGHT OF THE 5TH TO THE 6TH OF JULY 1809 ON THIS OCCASION M
MYRIEL
WAS SUMMONED BY NAPOLEON TO THE SYNOD OF THE BISHOPS OF FRANCE AND ITALY
CONVENED AT PARIS
THIS SYNOD WAS HELD AT NOTRE DAME AND ASSEMBLED
FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE 15TH OF JUNE 1811 UNDER THE PRESIDENCY
OF CARDINAL FESCH
M
MYRIEL WAS ONE OF THE NINETY FIVE BISHOPS WHO
ATTENDED IT
BUT HE WAS PRESENT ONLY AT ONE SITTING AND AT THREE OR FOUR
PRIVATE CONFERENCES
BISHOP OF A MOUNTAIN DIOCESE LIVING SO VERY CLOSE
TO NATURE IN RUSTICITY AND DEPRIVATION IT APPEARED THAT HE IMPORTED
AMONG THESE EMINENT PERSONAGES IDEAS WHICH ALTERED THE TEMPERATURE OF
THE ASSEMBLY
HE VERY SOON RETURNED TO D HE WAS INTERROGATED AS TO
THIS SPEEDY RETURN AND HE REPLIED I EMBARRASSED THEM
THE OUTSIDE AIR
PENETRATED TO THEM THROUGH ME
I PRODUCED ON THEM THE EFFECT OF AN OPEN
DOOR
ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE SAID WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE THOSE GENTLEMEN ARE
PRINCES
I AM ONLY A POOR PEASANT BISHOP
THE FACT IS THAT HE DISPLEASED THEM
AMONG OTHER STRANGE THINGS IT IS
SAID THAT HE CHANCED TO REMARK ONE EVENING WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF AT
THE HOUSE OF ONE OF HIS MOST NOTABLE COLLEAGUES WHAT BEAUTIFUL CLOCKS
WHAT BEAUTIFUL CARPETS WHAT BEAUTIFUL LIVERIES THEY MUST BE A GREAT
TROUBLE
I WOULD NOT HAVE ALL THOSE SUPERFLUITIES CRYING INCESSANTLY
IN MY EARS 'THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE HUNGRY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE
COLD THERE ARE POOR PEOPLE THERE ARE POOR PEOPLE
LET US REMARK BY THE WAY THAT THE HATRED OF LUXURY IS NOT AN
INTELLIGENT HATRED
THIS HATRED WOULD INVOLVE THE HATRED OF THE ARTS
NEVERTHELESS IN CHURCHMEN LUXURY IS WRONG EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH
REPRESENTATIONS AND CEREMONIES
IT SEEMS TO REVEAL HABITS WHICH HAVE
VERY LITTLE THAT IS CHARITABLE ABOUT THEM
AN OPULENT PRIEST IS A
CONTRADICTION
THE PRIEST MUST KEEP CLOSE TO THE POOR
NOW CAN ONE COME
IN CONTACT INCESSANTLY NIGHT AND DAY WITH ALL THIS DISTRESS ALL THESE
MISFORTUNES AND THIS POVERTY WITHOUT HAVING ABOUT ONE'S OWN PERSON A
LITTLE OF THAT MISERY LIKE THE DUST OF LABOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE
A MAN NEAR A BRAZIER WHO IS NOT WARM CAN ONE IMAGINE A WORKMAN WHO IS
WORKING NEAR A FURNACE AND WHO HAS NEITHER A SINGED HAIR NOR BLACKENED
NAILS NOR A DROP OF SWEAT NOR A SPECK OF ASHES ON HIS FACE THE FIRST
PROOF OF CHARITY IN THE PRIEST IN THE BISHOP ESPECIALLY IS POVERTY
THIS IS NO DOUBT WHAT THE BISHOP OF D THOUGHT
IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED HOWEVER THAT HE SHARED WHAT WE CALL THE IDEAS
OF THE CENTURY ON CERTAIN DELICATE POINTS
HE TOOK VERY LITTLE PART
IN THE THEOLOGICAL QUARRELS OF THE MOMENT AND MAINTAINED SILENCE ON
QUESTIONS IN WHICH CHURCH AND STATE WERE IMPLICATED BUT IF HE HAD
BEEN STRONGLY PRESSED IT SEEMS THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE AN
ULTRAMONTANE RATHER THAN A GALLICAN
SINCE WE ARE MAKING A PORTRAIT AND
SINCE WE DO NOT WISH TO CONCEAL ANYTHING WE ARE FORCED TO ADD THAT HE
WAS GLACIAL TOWARDS NAPOLEON IN HIS DECLINE
BEGINNING WITH 1813 HE
GAVE IN HIS ADHERENCE TO OR APPLAUDED ALL HOSTILE MANIFESTATIONS
HE
REFUSED TO SEE HIM AS HE PASSED THROUGH ON HIS RETURN FROM THE ISLAND
OF ELBA AND HE ABSTAINED FROM ORDERING PUBLIC PRAYERS FOR THE EMPEROR
IN HIS DIOCESE DURING THE HUNDRED DAYS
BESIDES HIS SISTER MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE HE HAD TWO BROTHERS ONE A
GENERAL THE OTHER A PREFECT
HE WROTE TO BOTH WITH TOLERABLE FREQUENCY
HE WAS HARSH FOR A TIME TOWARDS THE FORMER BECAUSE HOLDING A COMMAND
IN PROVENCE AT THE EPOCH OF THE DISEMBARKATION AT CANNES THE GENERAL
HAD PUT HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF TWELVE HUNDRED MEN AND HAD PURSUED THE
EMPEROR AS THOUGH THE LATTER HAD BEEN A PERSON WHOM ONE IS DESIROUS
OF ALLOWING TO ESCAPE
HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE OTHER BROTHER THE
EX PREFECT A FINE WORTHY MAN WHO LIVED IN RETIREMENT AT PARIS RUE
CASSETTE REMAINED MORE AFFECTIONATE
THUS MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU ALSO HAD HIS HOUR OF PARTY SPIRIT HIS HOUR
OF BITTERNESS HIS CLOUD
THE SHADOW OF THE PASSIONS OF THE MOMENT
TRAVERSED THIS GRAND AND GENTLE SPIRIT OCCUPIED WITH ETERNAL THINGS
CERTAINLY SUCH A MAN WOULD HAVE DONE WELL NOT TO ENTERTAIN ANY
POLITICAL OPINIONS
LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE AS TO OUR MEANING WE ARE
NOT CONFOUNDING WHAT IS CALLED POLITICAL OPINIONS WITH THE GRAND
ASPIRATION FOR PROGRESS WITH THE SUBLIME FAITH PATRIOTIC DEMOCRATIC
HUMANE WHICH IN OUR DAY SHOULD BE THE VERY FOUNDATION OF EVERY GENEROUS
INTELLECT
WITHOUT GOING DEEPLY INTO QUESTIONS WHICH ARE ONLY INDIRECTLY
CONNECTED WITH THE SUBJECT OF THIS BOOK WE WILL SIMPLY SAY THIS IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL IF MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU HAD NOT BEEN A ROYALIST
AND IF HIS GLANCE HAD NEVER BEEN FOR A SINGLE INSTANT TURNED AWAY FROM
THAT SERENE CONTEMPLATION IN WHICH IS DISTINCTLY DISCERNIBLE ABOVE THE
FICTIONS AND THE HATREDS OF THIS WORLD ABOVE THE STORMY VICISSITUDES OF
HUMAN THINGS THE BEAMING OF THOSE THREE PURE RADIANCES TRUTH JUSTICE
AND CHARITY
WHILE ADMITTING THAT IT WAS NOT FOR A POLITICAL OFFICE THAT GOD CREATED
MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME WE SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD AND ADMIRED HIS PROTEST
IN THE NAME OF RIGHT AND LIBERTY HIS PROUD OPPOSITION HIS JUST BUT
PERILOUS RESISTANCE TO THE ALL POWERFUL NAPOLEON
BUT THAT WHICH PLEASES
US IN PEOPLE WHO ARE RISING PLEASES US LESS IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE WHO
ARE FALLING
WE ONLY LOVE THE FRAY SO LONG AS THERE IS DANGER AND IN
ANY CASE THE COMBATANTS OF THE FIRST HOUR HAVE ALONE THE RIGHT TO BE
THE EXTERMINATORS OF THE LAST
HE WHO HAS NOT BEEN A STUBBORN ACCUSER IN
PROSPERITY SHOULD HOLD HIS PEACE IN THE FACE OF RUIN
THE DENUNCIATOR OF
SUCCESS IS THE ONLY LEGITIMATE EXECUTIONER OF THE FALL
AS FOR US WHEN
PROVIDENCE INTERVENES AND STRIKES WE LET IT WORK
1812 COMMENCED TO
DISARM US
IN 1813 THE COWARDLY BREACH OF SILENCE OF THAT TACITURN
LEGISLATIVE BODY EMBOLDENED BY CATASTROPHE POSSESSED ONLY TRAITS WHICH
AROUSED INDIGNATION
AND IT WAS A CRIME TO APPLAUD IN 1814 IN THE
PRESENCE OF THOSE MARSHALS WHO BETRAYED IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT SENATE
WHICH PASSED FROM ONE DUNGHILL TO ANOTHER INSULTING AFTER HAVING
DEIFIED IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT IDOLATRY WHICH WAS LOOSING ITS FOOTING
AND SPITTING ON ITS IDOL IT WAS A DUTY TO TURN ASIDE THE HEAD
IN
1815 WHEN THE SUPREME DISASTERS FILLED THE AIR WHEN FRANCE WAS SEIZED
WITH A SHIVER AT THEIR SINISTER APPROACH WHEN WATERLOO COULD BE DIMLY
DISCERNED OPENING BEFORE NAPOLEON THE MOURNFUL ACCLAMATION OF THE ARMY
AND THE PEOPLE TO THE CONDEMNED OF DESTINY HAD NOTHING LAUGHABLE IN IT
AND AFTER MAKING ALL ALLOWANCE FOR THE DESPOT A HEART LIKE THAT OF
THE BISHOP OF D OUGHT NOT PERHAPS TO HAVE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE
AUGUST AND TOUCHING FEATURES PRESENTED BY THE EMBRACE OF A GREAT NATION
AND A GREAT MAN ON THE BRINK OF THE ABYSS
WITH THIS EXCEPTION HE WAS IN ALL THINGS JUST TRUE EQUITABLE
INTELLIGENT HUMBLE AND DIGNIFIED BENEFICENT AND KINDLY WHICH IS ONLY
ANOTHER SORT OF BENEVOLENCE
HE WAS A PRIEST A SAGE AND A MAN
IT MUST
BE ADMITTED THAT EVEN IN THE POLITICAL VIEWS WITH WHICH WE HAVE JUST
REPROACHED HIM AND WHICH WE ARE DISPOSED TO JUDGE ALMOST WITH SEVERITY
HE WAS TOLERANT AND EASY MORE SO PERHAPS THAN WE WHO ARE SPEAKING
HERE
THE PORTER OF THE TOWN HALL HAD BEEN PLACED THERE BY THE EMPEROR
HE WAS AN OLD NON COMMISSIONED OFFICER OF THE OLD GUARD A MEMBER OF THE
LEGION OF HONOR AT AUSTERLITZ AS MUCH OF A BONAPARTIST AS THE EAGLE
THIS POOR FELLOW OCCASIONALLY LET SLIP INCONSIDERATE REMARKS WHICH THE
LAW THEN STIGMATIZED AS SEDITIOUS SPEECHES
AFTER THE IMPERIAL PROFILE
DISAPPEARED FROM THE LEGION OF HONOR HE NEVER DRESSED HIMSELF IN HIS
REGIMENTALS AS HE SAID SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE OBLIGED TO WEAR HIS
CROSS
HE HAD HIMSELF DEVOUTLY REMOVED THE IMPERIAL EFFIGY FROM THE
CROSS WHICH NAPOLEON HAD GIVEN HIM THIS MADE A HOLE AND HE WOULD NOT
PUT ANYTHING IN ITS PLACE
I WILL DIE HE SAID RATHER THAN WEAR THE
THREE FROGS UPON MY HEART HE LIKED TO SCOFF ALOUD AT LOUIS XVIII
THE
GOUTY OLD CREATURE IN ENGLISH GAITERS HE SAID LET HIM TAKE HIMSELF
OFF TO PRUSSIA WITH THAT QUEUE OF HIS HE WAS HAPPY TO COMBINE IN THE
SAME IMPRECATION THE TWO THINGS WHICH HE MOST DETESTED PRUSSIA AND
ENGLAND
HE DID IT SO OFTEN THAT HE LOST HIS PLACE
THERE HE WAS TURNED
OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND WITHOUT BREAD
THE
BISHOP SENT FOR HIM REPROVED HIM GENTLY AND APPOINTED HIM BEADLE IN
THE CATHEDRAL
IN THE COURSE OF NINE YEARS MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU HAD BY DINT OF HOLY
DEEDS AND GENTLE MANNERS FILLED THE TOWN OF D WITH A SORT OF
TENDER AND FILIAL REVERENCE
EVEN HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS NAPOLEON HAD BEEN
ACCEPTED AND TACITLY PARDONED AS IT WERE BY THE PEOPLE THE GOOD AND
WEAKLY FLOCK WHO ADORED THEIR EMPEROR BUT LOVED THEIR BISHOP
CHAPTER XII THE SOLITUDE OF MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME
A BISHOP IS ALMOST ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY A FULL SQUADRON OF LITTLE ABBES
JUST AS A GENERAL IS BY A COVEY OF YOUNG OFFICERS
THIS IS WHAT
THAT CHARMING SAINT FRANCOIS DE SALES CALLS SOMEWHERE LES PRETRES
BLANCS BECS CALLOW PRIESTS
EVERY CAREER HAS ITS ASPIRANTS WHO FORM
A TRAIN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ATTAINED EMINENCE IN IT
THERE IS NO POWER
WHICH HAS NOT ITS DEPENDENTS
THERE IS NO FORTUNE WHICH HAS NOT ITS
COURT
THE SEEKERS OF THE FUTURE EDDY AROUND THE SPLENDID PRESENT
EVERY
METROPOLIS HAS ITS STAFF OF OFFICIALS
EVERY BISHOP WHO POSSESSES THE
LEAST INFLUENCE HAS ABOUT HIM HIS PATROL OF CHERUBIM FROM THE SEMINARY
WHICH GOES THE ROUND AND MAINTAINS GOOD ORDER IN THE EPISCOPAL PALACE
AND MOUNTS GUARD OVER MONSEIGNEUR'S SMILE
TO PLEASE A BISHOP IS
EQUIVALENT TO GETTING ONE'S FOOT IN THE STIRRUP FOR A SUB DIACONATE
IT IS NECESSARY TO WALK ONE'S PATH DISCREETLY THE APOSTLESHIP DOES NOT
DISDAIN THE CANONSHIP
JUST AS THERE ARE BIGWIGS ELSEWHERE THERE ARE BIG MITRES IN THE CHURCH
THESE ARE THE BISHOPS WHO STAND WELL AT COURT WHO ARE RICH WELL
ENDOWED SKILFUL ACCEPTED BY THE WORLD WHO KNOW HOW TO PRAY NO DOUBT
BUT WHO KNOW ALSO HOW TO BEG WHO FEEL LITTLE SCRUPLE AT MAKING A WHOLE
DIOCESE DANCE ATTENDANCE IN THEIR PERSON WHO ARE CONNECTING LINKS
BETWEEN THE SACRISTY AND DIPLOMACY WHO ARE ABBES RATHER THAN PRIESTS
PRELATES RATHER THAN BISHOPS
HAPPY THOSE WHO APPROACH THEM BEING
PERSONS OF INFLUENCE THEY CREATE A SHOWER ABOUT THEM UPON THE
ASSIDUOUS AND THE FAVORED AND UPON ALL THE YOUNG MEN WHO UNDERSTAND
THE ART OF PLEASING OF LARGE PARISHES PREBENDS ARCHIDIACONATES
CHAPLAINCIES AND CATHEDRAL POSTS WHILE AWAITING EPISCOPAL HONORS
AS
THEY ADVANCE THEMSELVES THEY CAUSE THEIR SATELLITES TO PROGRESS ALSO
IT IS A WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM ON THE MARCH
THEIR RADIANCE CASTS A GLEAM
OF PURPLE OVER THEIR SUITE
THEIR PROSPERITY IS CRUMBLED UP BEHIND
THE SCENES INTO NICE LITTLE PROMOTIONS
THE LARGER THE DIOCESE OF THE
PATRON THE FATTER THE CURACY FOR THE FAVORITE
AND THEN THERE IS ROME
A BISHOP WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW TO BECOME AN ARCHBISHOP AN ARCHBISHOP WHO
KNOWS HOW TO BECOME A CARDINAL CARRIES YOU WITH HIM AS CONCLAVIST
YOU ENTER A COURT OF PAPAL JURISDICTION YOU RECEIVE THE PALLIUM AND
BEHOLD YOU ARE AN AUDITOR THEN A PAPAL CHAMBERLAIN THEN MONSIGNOR
AND FROM A GRACE TO AN EMINENCE IS ONLY A STEP AND BETWEEN THE EMINENCE
AND THE HOLINESS THERE IS BUT THE SMOKE OF A BALLOT
EVERY SKULL CAP MAY
DREAM OF THE TIARA
THE PRIEST IS NOWADAYS THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN BECOME A
KING IN A REGULAR MANNER AND WHAT A KING THE SUPREME KING
THEN WHAT A
NURSERY OF ASPIRATIONS IS A SEMINARY HOW MANY BLUSHING CHORISTERS
HOW MANY YOUTHFUL ABBES BEAR ON THEIR HEADS PERRETTE'S POT OF MILK
WHO KNOWS HOW EASY IT IS FOR AMBITION TO CALL ITSELF VOCATION IN GOOD
FAITH PERCHANCE AND DECEIVING ITSELF DEVOTEE THAT IT IS
MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU POOR HUMBLE RETIRING WAS NOT ACCOUNTED AMONG
THE BIG MITRES
THIS WAS PLAIN FROM THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF YOUNG
PRIESTS ABOUT HIM
WE HAVE SEEN THAT HE DID NOT TAKE IN PARIS
NOT A
SINGLE FUTURE DREAMED OF ENGRAFTING ITSELF ON THIS SOLITARY OLD MAN
NOT A SINGLE SPROUTING AMBITION COMMITTED THE FOLLY OF PUTTING FORTH ITS
FOLIAGE IN HIS SHADOW
HIS CANONS AND GRAND VICARS WERE GOOD OLD MEN
RATHER VULGAR LIKE HIMSELF WALLED UP LIKE HIM IN THIS DIOCESE WITHOUT
EXIT TO A CARDINALSHIP AND WHO RESEMBLED THEIR BISHOP WITH THIS
DIFFERENCE THAT THEY WERE FINISHED AND HE WAS COMPLETED
THE
IMPOSSIBILITY OF GROWING GREAT UNDER MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU WAS SO WELL
UNDERSTOOD THAT NO SOONER HAD THE YOUNG MEN WHOM HE ORDAINED LEFT THE
SEMINARY THAN THEY GOT THEMSELVES RECOMMENDED TO THE ARCHBISHOPS OF AIX
OR OF AUCH AND WENT OFF IN A GREAT HURRY
FOR IN SHORT WE REPEAT IT
MEN WISH TO BE PUSHED
A SAINT WHO DWELLS IN A PAROXYSM OF ABNEGATION
IS A DANGEROUS NEIGHBOR HE MIGHT COMMUNICATE TO YOU BY CONTAGION
AN INCURABLE POVERTY AN ANCHYLOSIS OF THE JOINTS WHICH ARE USEFUL IN
ADVANCEMENT AND IN SHORT MORE RENUNCIATION THAN YOU DESIRE AND
THIS INFECTIOUS VIRTUE IS AVOIDED
HENCE THE ISOLATION OF MONSEIGNEUR
BIENVENU
WE LIVE IN THE MIDST OF A GLOOMY SOCIETY
SUCCESS THAT IS THE
LESSON WHICH FALLS DROP BY DROP FROM THE SLOPE OF CORRUPTION
BE IT SAID IN PASSING THAT SUCCESS IS A VERY HIDEOUS THING
ITS FALSE
RESEMBLANCE TO MERIT DECEIVES MEN
FOR THE MASSES SUCCESS HAS ALMOST
THE SAME PROFILE AS SUPREMACY
SUCCESS THAT MENAECHMUS OF TALENT HAS
ONE DUPE HISTORY
JUVENAL AND TACITUS ALONE GRUMBLE AT IT
IN OUR
DAY A PHILOSOPHY WHICH IS ALMOST OFFICIAL HAS ENTERED INTO ITS
SERVICE WEARS THE LIVERY OF SUCCESS AND PERFORMS THE SERVICE OF ITS
ANTECHAMBER
SUCCEED THEORY
PROSPERITY ARGUES CAPACITY
WIN IN THE
LOTTERY AND BEHOLD YOU ARE A CLEVER MAN
HE WHO TRIUMPHS IS VENERATED
BE BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON IN YOUR MOUTH EVERYTHING LIES IN THAT
BE
LUCKY AND YOU WILL HAVE ALL THE REST BE HAPPY AND PEOPLE WILL THINK
YOU GREAT
OUTSIDE OF FIVE OR SIX IMMENSE EXCEPTIONS WHICH COMPOSE
THE SPLENDOR OF A CENTURY CONTEMPORARY ADMIRATION IS NOTHING BUT
SHORT SIGHTEDNESS
GILDING IS GOLD
IT DOES NO HARM TO BE THE FIRST
ARRIVAL BY PURE CHANCE SO LONG AS YOU DO ARRIVE
THE COMMON HERD IS AN
OLD NARCISSUS WHO ADORES HIMSELF AND WHO APPLAUDS THE VULGAR HERD
THAT ENORMOUS ABILITY BY VIRTUE OF WHICH ONE IS MOSES AESCHYLUS DANTE
MICHAEL ANGELO OR NAPOLEON THE MULTITUDE AWARDS ON THE SPOT AND BY
ACCLAMATION TO WHOMSOEVER ATTAINS HIS OBJECT IN WHATSOEVER IT MAY
CONSIST
LET A NOTARY TRANSFIGURE HIMSELF INTO A DEPUTY LET A FALSE
CORNEILLE COMPOSE TIRIDATE LET A EUNUCH COME TO POSSESS A HAREM LET A
MILITARY PRUDHOMME ACCIDENTALLY WIN THE DECISIVE BATTLE OF AN EPOCH
LET AN APOTHECARY INVENT CARDBOARD SHOE SOLES FOR THE ARMY OF THE
SAMBRE AND MEUSE AND CONSTRUCT FOR HIMSELF OUT OF THIS CARDBOARD SOLD
AS LEATHER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OF INCOME LET A PORK PACKER
ESPOUSE USURY AND CAUSE IT TO BRING FORTH SEVEN OR EIGHT MILLIONS OF
WHICH HE IS THE FATHER AND OF WHICH IT IS THE MOTHER LET A PREACHER
BECOME A BISHOP BY FORCE OF HIS NASAL DRAWL LET THE STEWARD OF A FINE
FAMILY BE SO RICH ON RETIRING FROM SERVICE THAT HE IS MADE MINISTER
OF FINANCES AND MEN CALL THAT GENIUS JUST AS THEY CALL THE FACE
OF MOUSQUETON BEAUTY AND THE MIEN OF CLAUDE MAJESTY
WITH THE
CONSTELLATIONS OF SPACE THEY CONFOUND THE STARS OF THE ABYSS WHICH ARE
MADE IN THE SOFT MIRE OF THE PUDDLE BY THE FEET OF DUCKS
CHAPTER XIII WHAT HE BELIEVED
WE ARE NOT OBLIGED TO SOUND THE BISHOP OF D ON THE SCORE OF
ORTHODOXY
IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SOUL WE FEEL OURSELVES IN NO MOOD
BUT RESPECT
THE CONSCIENCE OF THE JUST MAN SHOULD BE ACCEPTED ON HIS
WORD
MOREOVER CERTAIN NATURES BEING GIVEN WE ADMIT THE POSSIBLE
DEVELOPMENT OF ALL BEAUTIES OF HUMAN VIRTUE IN A BELIEF THAT DIFFERS
FROM OUR OWN
WHAT DID HE THINK OF THIS DOGMA OR OF THAT MYSTERY THESE SECRETS OF
THE INNER TRIBUNAL OF THE CONSCIENCE ARE KNOWN ONLY TO THE TOMB WHERE
SOULS ENTER NAKED
THE POINT ON WHICH WE ARE CERTAIN IS THAT THE
DIFFICULTIES OF FAITH NEVER RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO HYPOCRISY IN HIS
CASE
NO DECAY IS POSSIBLE TO THE DIAMOND
HE BELIEVED TO THE EXTENT
OF HIS POWERS
CREDO IN PATREM HE OFTEN EXCLAIMED
MOREOVER HE
DREW FROM GOOD WORKS THAT AMOUNT OF SATISFACTION WHICH SUFFICES TO THE
CONSCIENCE AND WHICH WHISPERS TO A MAN THOU ART WITH GOD
THE POINT WHICH WE CONSIDER IT OUR DUTY TO NOTE IS THAT OUTSIDE OF AND
BEYOND HIS FAITH AS IT WERE THE BISHOP POSSESSED AN EXCESS OF LOVE
IT
WAS IN THAT QUARTER QUIA MULTUM AMAVIT BECAUSE HE LOVED MUCH THAT
HE WAS REGARDED AS VULNERABLE BY SERIOUS MEN GRAVE PERSONS AND
REASONABLE PEOPLE FAVORITE LOCUTIONS OF OUR SAD WORLD WHERE EGOTISM
TAKES ITS WORD OF COMMAND FROM PEDANTRY
WHAT WAS THIS EXCESS OF LOVE
IT WAS A SERENE BENEVOLENCE WHICH OVERFLOWED MEN AS WE HAVE ALREADY
POINTED OUT AND WHICH ON OCCASION EXTENDED EVEN TO THINGS
HE LIVED
WITHOUT DISDAIN
HE WAS INDULGENT TOWARDS GOD'S CREATION
EVERY MAN
EVEN THE BEST HAS WITHIN HIM A THOUGHTLESS HARSHNESS WHICH HE RESERVES
FOR ANIMALS
THE BISHOP OF D HAD NONE OF THAT HARSHNESS WHICH IS
PECULIAR TO MANY PRIESTS NEVERTHELESS
HE DID NOT GO AS FAR AS THE
BRAHMIN BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE WEIGHED THIS SAYING OF ECCLESIASTES WHO
KNOWETH WHITHER THE SOUL OF THE ANIMAL GOETH HIDEOUSNESS OF ASPECT
DEFORMITY OF INSTINCT TROUBLED HIM NOT AND DID NOT AROUSE HIS
INDIGNATION
HE WAS TOUCHED ALMOST SOFTENED BY THEM
IT SEEMED AS
THOUGH HE WENT THOUGHTFULLY AWAY TO SEEK BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF LIFE WHICH
IS APPARENT THE CAUSE THE EXPLANATION OR THE EXCUSE FOR THEM
HE
SEEMED AT TIMES TO BE ASKING GOD TO COMMUTE THESE PENALTIES
HE EXAMINED
WITHOUT WRATH AND WITH THE EYE OF A LINGUIST WHO IS DECIPHERING A
PALIMPSEST THAT PORTION OF CHAOS WHICH STILL EXISTS IN NATURE
THIS
REVERY SOMETIMES CAUSED HIM TO UTTER ODD SAYINGS
ONE MORNING HE WAS IN
HIS GARDEN AND THOUGHT HIMSELF ALONE BUT HIS SISTER WAS WALKING BEHIND
HIM UNSEEN BY HIM SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND GAZED AT SOMETHING ON THE
GROUND IT WAS A LARGE BLACK HAIRY FRIGHTFUL SPIDER
HIS SISTER HEARD
HIM SAY
POOR BEAST IT IS NOT ITS FAULT
WHY NOT MENTION THESE ALMOST DIVINELY CHILDISH SAYINGS OF KINDNESS
PUERILE THEY MAY BE BUT THESE SUBLIME PUERILITIES WERE PECULIAR TO
SAINT FRANCIS D'ASSISI AND OF MARCUS AURELIUS
ONE DAY HE SPRAINED HIS
ANKLE IN HIS EFFORT TO AVOID STEPPING ON AN ANT
THUS LIVED THIS JUST
MAN
SOMETIMES HE FELL ASLEEP IN HIS GARDEN AND THEN THERE WAS NOTHING
MORE VENERABLE POSSIBLE
MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU HAD FORMERLY BEEN IF THE STORIES ANENT HIS YOUTH
AND EVEN IN REGARD TO HIS MANHOOD WERE TO BE BELIEVED A PASSIONATE
AND POSSIBLY A VIOLENT MAN
HIS UNIVERSAL SUAVITY WAS LESS AN INSTINCT
OF NATURE THAN THE RESULT OF A GRAND CONVICTION WHICH HAD FILTERED INTO
HIS HEART THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF LIFE AND HAD TRICKLED THERE SLOWLY
THOUGHT BY THOUGHT FOR IN A CHARACTER AS IN A ROCK THERE MAY EXIST
APERTURES MADE BY DROPS OF WATER
THESE HOLLOWS ARE UNEFFACEABLE THESE
FORMATIONS ARE INDESTRUCTIBLE
IN 1815 AS WE THINK WE HAVE ALREADY SAID HE REACHED HIS SEVENTY FIFTH
BIRTHDAY BUT HE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MORE THAN SIXTY
HE WAS NOT TALL
HE WAS RATHER PLUMP AND IN ORDER TO COMBAT THIS TENDENCY HE WAS FOND
OF TAKING LONG STROLLS ON FOOT HIS STEP WAS FIRM AND HIS FORM WAS
BUT SLIGHTLY BENT A DETAIL FROM WHICH WE DO NOT PRETEND TO DRAW ANY
CONCLUSION
GREGORY XVI AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY HELD HIMSELF ERECT AND
SMILING WHICH DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING A BAD BISHOP
MONSEIGNEUR
WELCOME HAD WHAT THE PEOPLE TERM A FINE HEAD BUT SO AMIABLE WAS HE
THAT THEY FORGOT THAT IT WAS FINE
WHEN HE CONVERSED WITH THAT INFANTILE GAYETY WHICH WAS ONE OF HIS
CHARMS AND OF WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN PEOPLE FELT AT THEIR EASE
WITH HIM AND JOY SEEMED TO RADIATE FROM HIS WHOLE PERSON
HIS FRESH AND
RUDDY COMPLEXION HIS VERY WHITE TEETH ALL OF WHICH HE HAD PRESERVED
AND WHICH WERE DISPLAYED BY HIS SMILE GAVE HIM THAT OPEN AND EASY AIR
WHICH CAUSE THE REMARK TO BE MADE OF A MAN HE'S A GOOD FELLOW AND
OF AN OLD MAN HE IS A FINE MAN THAT IT WILL BE RECALLED WAS THE
EFFECT WHICH HE PRODUCED UPON NAPOLEON
ON THE FIRST ENCOUNTER AND TO
ONE WHO SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WAS NOTHING IN FACT BUT A FINE
MAN
BUT IF ONE REMAINED NEAR HIM FOR A FEW HOURS AND BEHELD HIM IN THE
LEAST DEGREE PENSIVE THE FINE MAN BECAME GRADUALLY TRANSFIGURED AND
TOOK ON SOME IMPOSING QUALITY I KNOW NOT WHAT HIS BROAD AND SERIOUS
BROW RENDERED AUGUST BY HIS WHITE LOCKS BECAME AUGUST ALSO BY VIRTUE
OF MEDITATION MAJESTY RADIATED FROM HIS GOODNESS THOUGH HIS GOODNESS
CEASED NOT TO BE RADIANT ONE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING OF THE EMOTION WHICH
ONE WOULD FEEL ON BEHOLDING A SMILING ANGEL SLOWLY UNFOLD HIS WINGS
WITHOUT CEASING TO SMILE
RESPECT AN UNUTTERABLE RESPECT PENETRATED
YOU BY DEGREES AND MOUNTED TO YOUR HEART AND ONE FELT THAT ONE HAD
BEFORE HIM ONE OF THOSE STRONG THOROUGHLY TRIED AND INDULGENT SOULS
WHERE THOUGHT IS SO GRAND THAT IT CAN NO LONGER BE ANYTHING BUT GENTLE
AS WE HAVE SEEN PRAYER THE CELEBRATION OF THE OFFICES OF RELIGION
ALMS GIVING THE CONSOLATION OF THE AFFLICTED THE CULTIVATION OF A BIT
OF LAND FRATERNITY FRUGALITY HOSPITALITY RENUNCIATION CONFIDENCE
STUDY WORK FILLED EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE
FILLED IS EXACTLY THE WORD
CERTAINLY THE BISHOP'S DAY WAS QUITE FULL TO THE BRIM OF GOOD WORDS AND
GOOD DEEDS
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS NOT COMPLETE IF COLD OR RAINY WEATHER
PREVENTED HIS PASSING AN HOUR OR TWO IN HIS GARDEN BEFORE GOING TO BED
AND AFTER THE TWO WOMEN HAD RETIRED
IT SEEMED TO BE A SORT OF RITE WITH
HIM TO PREPARE HIMSELF FOR SLUMBER BY MEDITATION IN THE PRESENCE OF
THE GRAND SPECTACLES OF THE NOCTURNAL HEAVENS
SOMETIMES IF THE TWO OLD
WOMEN WERE NOT ASLEEP THEY HEARD HIM PACING SLOWLY ALONG THE WALKS AT
A VERY ADVANCED HOUR OF THE NIGHT
HE WAS THERE ALONE COMMUNING WITH
HIMSELF PEACEFUL ADORING COMPARING THE SERENITY OF HIS HEART WITH THE
SERENITY OF THE ETHER MOVED AMID THE DARKNESS BY THE VISIBLE SPLENDOR
OF THE CONSTELLATIONS AND THE INVISIBLE SPLENDOR OF GOD OPENING HIS
HEART TO THE THOUGHTS WHICH FALL FROM THE UNKNOWN
AT SUCH MOMENTS
WHILE HE OFFERED HIS HEART AT THE HOUR WHEN NOCTURNAL FLOWERS OFFER
THEIR PERFUME ILLUMINATED LIKE A LAMP AMID THE STARRY NIGHT AS HE
POURED HIMSELF OUT IN ECSTASY IN THE MIDST OF THE UNIVERSAL RADIANCE OF
CREATION HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD HIMSELF PROBABLY WHAT WAS PASSING IN
HIS SPIRIT HE FELT SOMETHING TAKE ITS FLIGHT FROM HIM AND SOMETHING
DESCEND INTO HIM
MYSTERIOUS EXCHANGE OF THE ABYSSES OF THE SOUL WITH
THE ABYSSES OF THE UNIVERSE
HE THOUGHT OF THE GRANDEUR AND PRESENCE OF GOD OF THE FUTURE ETERNITY
THAT STRANGE MYSTERY OF THE ETERNITY PAST A MYSTERY STILL MORE
STRANGE OF ALL THE INFINITIES WHICH PIERCED THEIR WAY INTO ALL
HIS SENSES BENEATH HIS EYES AND WITHOUT SEEKING TO COMPREHEND THE
INCOMPREHENSIBLE HE GAZED UPON IT
HE DID NOT STUDY GOD HE WAS DAZZLED
BY HIM
HE CONSIDERED THOSE MAGNIFICENT CONJUNCTIONS OF ATOMS WHICH
COMMUNICATE ASPECTS TO MATTER REVEAL FORCES BY VERIFYING THEM CREATE
INDIVIDUALITIES IN UNITY PROPORTIONS IN EXTENT THE INNUMERABLE IN THE
INFINITE AND THROUGH LIGHT PRODUCE BEAUTY
THESE CONJUNCTIONS ARE
FORMED AND DISSOLVED INCESSANTLY HENCE LIFE AND DEATH
HE SEATED HIMSELF ON A WOODEN BENCH WITH HIS BACK AGAINST A DECREPIT
VINE HE GAZED AT THE STARS PAST THE PUNY AND STUNTED SILHOUETTES
OF HIS FRUIT TREES
THIS QUARTER OF AN ACRE SO POORLY PLANTED SO
ENCUMBERED WITH MEAN BUILDINGS AND SHEDS WAS DEAR TO HIM AND SATISFIED
HIS WANTS
WHAT MORE WAS NEEDED BY THIS OLD MAN WHO DIVIDED THE LEISURE OF HIS
LIFE WHERE THERE WAS SO LITTLE LEISURE BETWEEN GARDENING IN THE
DAYTIME AND CONTEMPLATION AT NIGHT WAS NOT THIS NARROW ENCLOSURE WITH
THE HEAVENS FOR A CEILING SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE HIM TO ADORE GOD IN HIS
MOST DIVINE WORKS IN TURN DOES NOT THIS COMPREHEND ALL IN FACT AND
WHAT IS THERE LEFT TO DESIRE BEYOND IT A LITTLE GARDEN IN WHICH TO
WALK AND IMMENSITY IN WHICH TO DREAM
AT ONE'S FEET THAT WHICH CAN BE
CULTIVATED AND PLUCKED OVER HEAD THAT WHICH ONE CAN STUDY AND MEDITATE
UPON SOME FLOWERS ON EARTH AND ALL THE STARS IN THE SKY
CHAPTER XIV WHAT HE THOUGHT
ONE LAST WORD
SINCE THIS SORT OF DETAILS MIGHT PARTICULARLY AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
AND TO USE AN EXPRESSION NOW IN FASHION GIVE TO THE BISHOP OF D A
CERTAIN PANTHEISTICAL PHYSIOGNOMY AND INDUCE THE BELIEF EITHER
TO HIS CREDIT OR DISCREDIT THAT HE ENTERTAINED ONE OF THOSE PERSONAL
PHILOSOPHIES WHICH ARE PECULIAR TO OUR CENTURY WHICH SOMETIMES SPRING
UP IN SOLITARY SPIRITS AND THERE TAKE ON A FORM AND GROW UNTIL THEY
USURP THE PLACE OF RELIGION WE INSIST UPON IT THAT NOT ONE OF
THOSE PERSONS WHO KNEW MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF
AUTHORIZED TO THINK ANYTHING OF THE SORT
THAT WHICH ENLIGHTENED THIS
MAN WAS HIS HEART
HIS WISDOM WAS MADE OF THE LIGHT WHICH COMES FROM
THERE
NO SYSTEMS MANY WORKS
ABSTRUSE SPECULATIONS CONTAIN VERTIGO NO
THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT HE RISKED HIS MIND IN APOCALYPSES
THE
APOSTLE MAY BE DARING BUT THE BISHOP MUST BE TIMID
HE WOULD PROBABLY
HAVE FELT A SCRUPLE AT SOUNDING TOO FAR IN ADVANCE CERTAIN PROBLEMS
WHICH ARE IN A MANNER RESERVED FOR TERRIBLE GREAT MINDS
THERE IS A
SACRED HORROR BENEATH THE PORCHES OF THE ENIGMA THOSE GLOOMY OPENINGS
STAND YAWNING THERE BUT SOMETHING TELLS YOU YOU A PASSER BY IN LIFE
THAT YOU MUST NOT ENTER
WOE TO HIM WHO PENETRATES THITHER
GENIUSES IN THE IMPENETRABLE DEPTHS OF ABSTRACTION AND PURE SPECULATION
SITUATED SO TO SPEAK ABOVE ALL DOGMAS PROPOSE THEIR IDEAS TO
GOD
THEIR PRAYER AUDACIOUSLY OFFERS DISCUSSION
THEIR ADORATION
INTERROGATES
THIS IS DIRECT RELIGION WHICH IS FULL OF ANXIETY AND
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIM WHO ATTEMPTS ITS STEEP CLIFFS
HUMAN MEDITATION HAS NO LIMITS
AT HIS OWN RISK AND PERIL IT ANALYZES
AND DIGS DEEP INTO ITS OWN BEDAZZLEMENT
ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THAT BY
A SORT OF SPLENDID REACTION IT WITH IT DAZZLES NATURE THE MYSTERIOUS
WORLD WHICH SURROUNDS US RENDERS BACK WHAT IT HAS RECEIVED IT IS
PROBABLE THAT THE CONTEMPLATORS ARE CONTEMPLATED
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE
THERE ARE ON EARTH MEN WHO ARE THEY MEN PERCEIVE DISTINCTLY AT THE
VERGE OF THE HORIZONS OF REVERY THE HEIGHTS OF THE ABSOLUTE AND WHO
HAVE THE TERRIBLE VISION OF THE INFINITE MOUNTAIN
MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME
WAS ONE OF THESE MEN MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME WAS NOT A GENIUS
HE WOULD
HAVE FEARED THOSE SUBLIMITIES WHENCE SOME VERY GREAT MEN EVEN LIKE
SWEDENBORG AND PASCAL HAVE SLIPPED INTO INSANITY
CERTAINLY THESE
POWERFUL REVERIES HAVE THEIR MORAL UTILITY AND BY THESE ARDUOUS PATHS
ONE APPROACHES TO IDEAL PERFECTION
AS FOR HIM HE TOOK THE PATH WHICH
SHORTENS THE GOSPEL'S
HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO IMPART TO HIS CHASUBLE THE FOLDS OF ELIJAH'S
MANTLE HE PROJECTED NO RAY OF FUTURE UPON THE DARK GROUNDSWELL OF
EVENTS HE DID NOT SEEK TO CONDENSE IN FLAME THE LIGHT OF THINGS HE
HAD NOTHING OF THE PROPHET AND NOTHING OF THE MAGICIAN ABOUT HIM
THIS
HUMBLE SOUL LOVED AND THAT WAS ALL
THAT HE CARRIED PRAYER TO THE PITCH OF A SUPERHUMAN ASPIRATION IS
PROBABLE BUT ONE CAN NO MORE PRAY TOO MUCH THAN ONE CAN LOVE TOO MUCH
AND IF IT IS A HERESY TO PRAY BEYOND THE TEXTS SAINT THERESA AND SAINT
JEROME WOULD BE HERETICS
HE INCLINED TOWARDS ALL THAT GROANS AND ALL THAT EXPIATES
THE UNIVERSE
APPEARED TO HIM LIKE AN IMMENSE MALADY EVERYWHERE HE FELT FEVER
EVERYWHERE HE HEARD THE SOUND OF SUFFERING AND WITHOUT SEEKING TO
SOLVE THE ENIGMA HE STROVE TO DRESS THE WOUND
THE TERRIBLE SPECTACLE
OF CREATED THINGS DEVELOPED TENDERNESS IN HIM HE WAS OCCUPIED ONLY
IN FINDING FOR HIMSELF AND IN INSPIRING OTHERS WITH THE BEST WAY TO
COMPASSIONATE AND RELIEVE
THAT WHICH EXISTS WAS FOR THIS GOOD AND RARE
PRIEST A PERMANENT SUBJECT OF SADNESS WHICH SOUGHT CONSOLATION
THERE ARE MEN WHO TOIL AT EXTRACTING GOLD HE TOILED AT THE EXTRACTION
OF PITY
UNIVERSAL MISERY WAS HIS MINE
THE SADNESS WHICH REIGNED
EVERYWHERE WAS BUT AN EXCUSE FOR UNFAILING KINDNESS
LOVE EACH OTHER HE
DECLARED THIS TO BE COMPLETE DESIRED NOTHING FURTHER AND THAT WAS THE
WHOLE OF HIS DOCTRINE
ONE DAY THAT MAN WHO BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE A
PHILOSOPHER THE SENATOR WHO HAS ALREADY BEEN ALLUDED TO SAID TO THE
BISHOP JUST SURVEY THE SPECTACLE OF THE WORLD ALL WAR AGAINST
ALL THE STRONGEST HAS THE MOST WIT
YOUR LOVE EACH OTHER IS
NONSENSE WELL REPLIED MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME WITHOUT CONTESTING THE
POINT IF IT IS NONSENSE THE SOUL SHOULD SHUT ITSELF UP IN IT AS THE
PEARL IN THE OYSTER THUS HE SHUT HIMSELF UP HE LIVED THERE HE
WAS ABSOLUTELY SATISFIED WITH IT LEAVING ON ONE SIDE THE PRODIGIOUS
QUESTIONS WHICH ATTRACT AND TERRIFY THE FATHOMLESS PERSPECTIVES OF
ABSTRACTION THE PRECIPICES OF METAPHYSICS ALL THOSE PROFUNDITIES
WHICH CONVERGE FOR THE APOSTLE IN GOD FOR THE ATHEIST IN NOTHINGNESS
DESTINY GOOD AND EVIL THE WAY OF BEING AGAINST BEING THE CONSCIENCE
OF MAN THE THOUGHTFUL SOMNAMBULISM OF THE ANIMAL THE TRANSFORMATION
IN DEATH THE RECAPITULATION OF EXISTENCES WHICH THE TOMB CONTAINS THE
INCOMPREHENSIBLE GRAFTING OF SUCCESSIVE LOVES ON THE PERSISTENT I
THE ESSENCE THE SUBSTANCE THE NILE AND THE ENS THE SOUL NATURE
LIBERTY NECESSITY PERPENDICULAR PROBLEMS SINISTER OBSCURITIES WHERE
LEAN THE GIGANTIC ARCHANGELS OF THE HUMAN MIND FORMIDABLE ABYSSES
WHICH LUCRETIUS MANOU SAINT PAUL DANTE CONTEMPLATE WITH EYES
FLASHING LIGHTNING WHICH SEEMS BY ITS STEADY GAZE ON THE INFINITE TO
CAUSE STARS TO BLAZE FORTH THERE
MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU WAS SIMPLY A MAN WHO TOOK NOTE OF THE EXTERIOR OF
MYSTERIOUS QUESTIONS WITHOUT SCRUTINIZING THEM AND WITHOUT TROUBLING
HIS OWN MIND WITH THEM AND WHO CHERISHED IN HIS OWN SOUL A GRAVE
RESPECT FOR DARKNESS
BOOK SECOND THE FALL
CHAPTER I THE EVENING OF A DAY OF WALKING
EARLY IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 1815 ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET A
MAN WHO WAS TRAVELLING ON FOOT ENTERED THE LITTLE TOWN OF D THE FEW
INHABITANTS WHO WERE AT THEIR WINDOWS OR ON THEIR THRESHOLDS AT THE
MOMENT STARED AT THIS TRAVELLER WITH A SORT OF UNEASINESS
IT WAS
DIFFICULT TO ENCOUNTER A WAYFARER OF MORE WRETCHED APPEARANCE
HE WAS
A MAN OF MEDIUM STATURE THICKSET AND ROBUST IN THE PRIME OF LIFE
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORTY SIX OR FORTY EIGHT YEARS OLD
A CAP WITH A
DROOPING LEATHER VISOR PARTLY CONCEALED HIS FACE BURNED AND TANNED BY
SUN AND WIND AND DRIPPING WITH PERSPIRATION
HIS SHIRT OF COARSE YELLOW
LINEN FASTENED AT THE NECK BY A SMALL SILVER ANCHOR PERMITTED A VIEW
OF HIS HAIRY BREAST HE HAD A CRAVAT TWISTED INTO A STRING TROUSERS OF
BLUE DRILLING WORN AND THREADBARE WHITE ON ONE KNEE AND TORN ON THE
OTHER AN OLD GRAY TATTERED BLOUSE PATCHED ON ONE OF THE ELBOWS WITH
A BIT OF GREEN CLOTH SEWED ON WITH TWINE A TIGHTLY PACKED SOLDIER
KNAPSACK WELL BUCKLED AND PERFECTLY NEW ON HIS BACK AN ENORMOUS
KNOTTY STICK IN HIS HAND IRON SHOD SHOES ON HIS STOCKINGLESS FEET A
SHAVED HEAD AND A LONG BEARD
THE SWEAT THE HEAT THE JOURNEY ON FOOT THE DUST ADDED I KNOW NOT
WHAT SORDID QUALITY TO THIS DILAPIDATED WHOLE
HIS HAIR WAS CLOSELY CUT
YET BRISTLING FOR IT HAD BEGUN TO GROW A LITTLE AND DID NOT SEEM TO
HAVE BEEN CUT FOR SOME TIME
NO ONE KNEW HIM
HE WAS EVIDENTLY ONLY A CHANCE PASSER BY
WHENCE CAME
HE FROM THE SOUTH FROM THE SEASHORE PERHAPS FOR HE MADE HIS ENTRANCE
INTO D BY THE SAME STREET WHICH SEVEN MONTHS PREVIOUSLY HAD
WITNESSED THE PASSAGE OF THE EMPEROR NAPOLEON ON HIS WAY FROM CANNES
TO PARIS
THIS MAN MUST HAVE BEEN WALKING ALL DAY
HE SEEMED VERY MUCH
FATIGUED
SOME WOMEN OF THE ANCIENT MARKET TOWN WHICH IS SITUATED BELOW
THE CITY HAD SEEN HIM PAUSE BENEATH THE TREES OF THE BOULEVARD GASSENDI
AND DRINK AT THE FOUNTAIN WHICH STANDS AT THE END OF THE PROMENADE
HE
MUST HAVE BEEN VERY THIRSTY FOR THE CHILDREN WHO FOLLOWED HIM SAW HIM
STOP AGAIN FOR A DRINK TWO HUNDRED PACES FURTHER ON AT THE FOUNTAIN IN
THE MARKET PLACE
ON ARRIVING AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE POICHEVERT HE TURNED TO THE LEFT
AND DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARD THE TOWN HALL
HE ENTERED THEN CAME OUT
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER
A GENDARME WAS SEATED NEAR THE DOOR ON THE
STONE BENCH WHICH GENERAL DROUOT HAD MOUNTED ON THE 4TH OF MARCH TO READ
TO THE FRIGHTENED THRONG OF THE INHABITANTS OF D THE PROCLAMATION
OF THE GULF JUAN
THE MAN PULLED OFF HIS CAP AND HUMBLY SALUTED THE
GENDARME
THE GENDARME WITHOUT REPLYING TO HIS SALUTE STARED ATTENTIVELY AT HIM
FOLLOWED HIM FOR A WHILE WITH HIS EYES AND THEN ENTERED THE TOWN HALL
THERE THEN EXISTED AT D A FINE INN AT THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OF
COLBAS
THIS INN HAD FOR A LANDLORD A CERTAIN JACQUIN LABARRE A MAN
OF CONSIDERATION IN THE TOWN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS RELATIONSHIP TO ANOTHER
LABARRE WHO KEPT THE INN OF THE THREE DAUPHINS IN GRENOBLE AND HAD
SERVED IN THE GUIDES
AT THE TIME OF THE EMPEROR'S LANDING MANY RUMORS
HAD CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WITH REGARD TO THIS INN OF THE
THREE DAUPHINS
IT WAS SAID THAT GENERAL BERTRAND DISGUISED AS A
CARTER HAD MADE FREQUENT TRIPS THITHER IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY AND
THAT HE HAD DISTRIBUTED CROSSES OF HONOR TO THE SOLDIERS AND HANDFULS
OF GOLD TO THE CITIZENS
THE TRUTH IS THAT WHEN THE EMPEROR ENTERED
GRENOBLE HE HAD REFUSED TO INSTALL HIMSELF AT THE HOTEL OF THE
PREFECTURE HE HAD THANKED THE MAYOR SAYING I AM GOING TO THE HOUSE
OF A BRAVE MAN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE AND HE HAD BETAKEN HIMSELF TO THE
THREE DAUPHINS
THIS GLORY OF THE LABARRE OF THE THREE DAUPHINS WAS
REFLECTED UPON THE LABARRE OF THE CROSS OF COLBAS AT A DISTANCE OF FIVE
AND TWENTY LEAGUES
IT WAS SAID OF HIM IN THE TOWN THAT IS THE COUSIN
OF THE MAN OF GRENOBLE
THE MAN BENT HIS STEPS TOWARDS THIS INN WHICH WAS THE BEST IN THE
COUNTRY SIDE
HE ENTERED THE KITCHEN WHICH OPENED ON A LEVEL WITH THE
STREET
ALL THE STOVES WERE LIGHTED A HUGE FIRE BLAZED GAYLY IN THE
FIREPLACE
THE HOST WHO WAS ALSO THE CHIEF COOK WAS GOING FROM ONE
STEW PAN TO ANOTHER VERY BUSILY SUPERINTENDING AN EXCELLENT DINNER
DESIGNED FOR THE WAGONERS WHOSE LOUD TALKING CONVERSATION AND
LAUGHTER WERE AUDIBLE FROM AN ADJOINING APARTMENT
ANY ONE WHO HAS
TRAVELLED KNOWS THAT THERE IS NO ONE WHO INDULGES IN BETTER CHEER THAN
WAGONERS
A FAT MARMOT FLANKED BY WHITE PARTRIDGES AND HEATHER COCKS
WAS TURNING ON A LONG SPIT BEFORE THE FIRE ON THE STOVE TWO HUGE CARPS
FROM LAKE LAUZET AND A TROUT FROM LAKE ALLOZ WERE COOKING
THE HOST HEARING THE DOOR OPEN AND SEEING A NEWCOMER ENTER SAID
WITHOUT RAISING HIS EYES FROM HIS STOVES
WHAT DO YOU WISH SIR
FOOD AND LODGING SAID THE MAN
NOTHING EASIER REPLIED THE HOST
AT THAT MOMENT HE TURNED HIS HEAD
TOOK IN THE TRAVELLER'S APPEARANCE WITH A SINGLE GLANCE AND ADDED BY
PAYING FOR IT
THE MAN DREW A LARGE LEATHER PURSE FROM THE POCKET OF HIS BLOUSE AND
ANSWERED I HAVE MONEY
IN THAT CASE WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE SAID THE HOST
THE MAN PUT HIS PURSE BACK IN HIS POCKET REMOVED HIS KNAPSACK FROM
HIS BACK PUT IT ON THE GROUND NEAR THE DOOR RETAINED HIS STICK IN HIS
HAND AND SEATED HIMSELF ON A LOW STOOL CLOSE TO THE FIRE
D IS IN
THE MOUNTAINS
THE EVENINGS ARE COLD THERE IN OCTOBER
BUT AS THE HOST WENT BACK AND FORTH HE SCRUTINIZED THE TRAVELLER
WILL DINNER BE READY SOON SAID THE MAN
IMMEDIATELY REPLIED THE LANDLORD
WHILE THE NEWCOMER WAS WARMING HIMSELF BEFORE THE FIRE WITH HIS BACK
TURNED THE WORTHY HOST JACQUIN LABARRE DREW A PENCIL FROM HIS POCKET
THEN TORE OFF THE CORNER OF AN OLD NEWSPAPER WHICH WAS LYING ON A SMALL
TABLE NEAR THE WINDOW
ON THE WHITE MARGIN HE WROTE A LINE OR TWO
FOLDED IT WITHOUT SEALING AND THEN INTRUSTED THIS SCRAP OF PAPER TO
A CHILD WHO SEEMED TO SERVE HIM IN THE CAPACITY BOTH OF SCULLION AND
LACKEY
THE LANDLORD WHISPERED A WORD IN THE SCULLION'S EAR AND THE
CHILD SET OFF ON A RUN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TOWN HALL
THE TRAVELLER SAW NOTHING OF ALL THIS
ONCE MORE HE INQUIRED WILL DINNER BE READY SOON
IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED THE HOST
THE CHILD RETURNED
HE BROUGHT BACK THE PAPER
THE HOST UNFOLDED IT
EAGERLY LIKE A PERSON WHO IS EXPECTING A REPLY
HE SEEMED TO READ IT
ATTENTIVELY THEN TOSSED HIS HEAD AND REMAINED THOUGHTFUL FOR A MOMENT
THEN HE TOOK A STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAVELLER WHO APPEARED TO
BE IMMERSED IN REFLECTIONS WHICH WERE NOT VERY SERENE
I CANNOT RECEIVE YOU SIR SAID HE
THE MAN HALF ROSE
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID THAT I WILL NOT PAY YOU DO YOU WANT ME TO PAY YOU
IN ADVANCE I HAVE MONEY I TELL YOU
IT IS NOT THAT
WHAT THEN
YOU HAVE MONEY
YES SAID THE MAN
AND I SAID THE HOST HAVE NO ROOM
THE MAN RESUMED TRANQUILLY PUT ME IN THE STABLE
I CANNOT
WHY
THE HORSES TAKE UP ALL THE SPACE
VERY WELL RETORTED THE MAN A CORNER OF THE LOFT THEN A TRUSS OF
STRAW
WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT AFTER DINNER
I CANNOT GIVE YOU ANY DINNER
THIS DECLARATION MADE IN A MEASURED BUT FIRM TONE STRUCK THE STRANGER
AS GRAVE
HE ROSE
AH BAH BUT I AM DYING OF HUNGER
I HAVE BEEN WALKING SINCE SUNRISE
I
HAVE TRAVELLED TWELVE LEAGUES
I PAY
I WISH TO EAT
I HAVE NOTHING SAID THE LANDLORD
THE MAN BURST OUT LAUGHING AND TURNED TOWARDS THE FIREPLACE AND THE
STOVES NOTHING AND ALL THAT
ALL THAT IS ENGAGED
BY WHOM
BY MESSIEURS THE WAGONERS
HOW MANY ARE THERE OF THEM
TWELVE
THERE IS ENOUGH FOOD THERE FOR TWENTY
THEY HAVE ENGAGED THE WHOLE OF IT AND PAID FOR IT IN ADVANCE
THE MAN SEATED HIMSELF AGAIN AND SAID WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE I AM
AT AN INN I AM HUNGRY AND I SHALL REMAIN
THEN THE HOST BENT DOWN TO HIS EAR AND SAID IN A TONE WHICH MADE HIM
START GO AWAY
AT THAT MOMENT THE TRAVELLER WAS BENDING FORWARD AND THRUSTING SOME
BRANDS INTO THE FIRE WITH THE IRON SHOD TIP OF HIS STAFF HE TURNED
QUICKLY ROUND AND AS HE OPENED HIS MOUTH TO REPLY THE HOST GAZED
STEADILY AT HIM AND ADDED STILL IN A LOW VOICE STOP THERE'S ENOUGH
OF THAT SORT OF TALK
DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU YOUR NAME YOUR NAME IS
JEAN VALJEAN
NOW DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE WHEN I SAW YOU
COME IN I SUSPECTED SOMETHING I SENT TO THE TOWN HALL AND THIS WAS THE
REPLY THAT WAS SENT TO ME
CAN YOU READ
SO SAYING HE HELD OUT TO THE STRANGER FULLY UNFOLDED THE PAPER WHICH
HAD JUST TRAVELLED FROM THE INN TO THE TOWN HALL AND FROM THE TOWN HALL
TO THE INN
THE MAN CAST A GLANCE UPON IT
THE LANDLORD RESUMED AFTER A
PAUSE
I AM IN THE HABIT OF BEING POLITE TO EVERY ONE
GO AWAY
THE MAN DROPPED HIS HEAD PICKED UP THE KNAPSACK WHICH HE HAD DEPOSITED
ON THE GROUND AND TOOK HIS DEPARTURE
HE CHOSE THE PRINCIPAL STREET
HE WALKED STRAIGHT ON AT A VENTURE
KEEPING CLOSE TO THE HOUSES LIKE A SAD AND HUMILIATED MAN
HE DID NOT
TURN ROUND A SINGLE TIME
HAD HE DONE SO HE WOULD HAVE SEEN THE HOST
OF THE CROSS OF COLBAS STANDING ON HIS THRESHOLD SURROUNDED BY ALL
THE GUESTS OF HIS INN AND ALL THE PASSERS BY IN THE STREET TALKING
VIVACIOUSLY AND POINTING HIM OUT WITH HIS FINGER AND FROM THE GLANCES
OF TERROR AND DISTRUST CAST BY THE GROUP HE MIGHT HAVE DIVINED THAT HIS
ARRIVAL WOULD SPEEDILY BECOME AN EVENT FOR THE WHOLE TOWN
HE SAW NOTHING OF ALL THIS
PEOPLE WHO ARE CRUSHED DO NOT LOOK BEHIND
THEM
THEY KNOW BUT TOO WELL THE EVIL FATE WHICH FOLLOWS THEM
THUS HE PROCEEDED FOR SOME TIME WALKING ON WITHOUT CEASING TRAVERSING
AT RANDOM STREETS OF WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING FORGETFUL OF HIS FATIGUE
AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WHEN A MAN IS SAD
ALL AT ONCE HE FELT THE PANGS
OF HUNGER SHARPLY
NIGHT WAS DRAWING NEAR
HE GLANCED ABOUT HIM TO SEE
WHETHER HE COULD NOT DISCOVER SOME SHELTER
THE FINE HOSTELRY WAS CLOSED TO HIM HE WAS SEEKING SOME VERY HUMBLE
PUBLIC HOUSE SOME HOVEL HOWEVER LOWLY
JUST THEN A LIGHT FLASHED UP AT THE END OF THE STREETS A PINE BRANCH
SUSPENDED FROM A CROSS BEAM OF IRON WAS OUTLINED AGAINST THE WHITE SKY
OF THE TWILIGHT
HE PROCEEDED THITHER
IT PROVED TO BE IN FACT A PUBLIC HOUSE
THE PUBLIC HOUSE WHICH IS IN
THE RUE DE CHAFFAUT
THE WAYFARER HALTED FOR A MOMENT AND PEEPED THROUGH THE WINDOW INTO THE
INTERIOR OF THE LOW STUDDED ROOM OF THE PUBLIC HOUSE ILLUMINATED BY A
SMALL LAMP ON A TABLE AND BY A LARGE FIRE ON THE HEARTH
SOME MEN WERE
ENGAGED IN DRINKING THERE
THE LANDLORD WAS WARMING HIMSELF
AN IRON
POT SUSPENDED FROM A CRANE BUBBLED OVER THE FLAME
THE ENTRANCE TO THIS PUBLIC HOUSE WHICH IS ALSO A SORT OF AN INN IS BY
TWO DOORS
ONE OPENS ON THE STREET THE OTHER UPON A SMALL YARD FILLED
WITH MANURE
THE TRAVELLER DARE NOT ENTER BY THE STREET DOOR
HE SLIPPED
INTO THE YARD HALTED AGAIN THEN RAISED THE LATCH TIMIDLY AND OPENED
THE DOOR
WHO GOES THERE SAID THE MASTER
SOME ONE WHO WANTS SUPPER AND BED
GOOD
WE FURNISH SUPPER AND BED HERE
HE ENTERED
ALL THE MEN WHO WERE DRINKING TURNED ROUND
THE LAMP
ILLUMINATED HIM ON ONE SIDE THE FIRELIGHT ON THE OTHER
THEY EXAMINED
HIM FOR SOME TIME WHILE HE WAS TAKING OFF HIS KNAPSACK
THE HOST SAID TO HIM THERE IS THE FIRE
THE SUPPER IS COOKING IN THE
POT
COME AND WARM YOURSELF COMRADE
HE APPROACHED AND SEATED HIMSELF NEAR THE HEARTH
HE STRETCHED OUT HIS
FEET WHICH WERE EXHAUSTED WITH FATIGUE TO THE FIRE A FINE ODOR WAS
EMITTED BY THE POT
ALL THAT COULD BE DISTINGUISHED OF HIS FACE BENEATH
HIS CAP WHICH WAS WELL PULLED DOWN ASSUMED A VAGUE APPEARANCE
OF COMFORT MINGLED WITH THAT OTHER POIGNANT ASPECT WHICH HABITUAL
SUFFERING BESTOWS
IT WAS MOREOVER A FIRM ENERGETIC AND MELANCHOLY PROFILE
THIS
PHYSIOGNOMY WAS STRANGELY COMPOSED IT BEGAN BY SEEMING HUMBLE AND
ENDED BY SEEMING SEVERE
THE EYE SHONE BENEATH ITS LASHES LIKE A FIRE
BENEATH BRUSHWOOD
ONE OF THE MEN SEATED AT THE TABLE HOWEVER WAS A FISHMONGER WHO
BEFORE ENTERING THE PUBLIC HOUSE OF THE RUE DE CHAFFAUT HAD BEEN TO
STABLE HIS HORSE AT LABARRE'S
IT CHANCED THAT HE HAD THAT VERY MORNING
ENCOUNTERED THIS UNPREPOSSESSING STRANGER ON THE ROAD BETWEEN BRAS
D'ASSE AND I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE NAME
I THINK IT WAS ESCOUBLON
NOW
WHEN HE MET HIM THE MAN WHO THEN SEEMED ALREADY EXTREMELY WEARY HAD
REQUESTED HIM TO TAKE HIM ON HIS CRUPPER TO WHICH THE FISHMONGER HAD
MADE NO REPLY EXCEPT BY REDOUBLING HIS GAIT
THIS FISHMONGER HAD BEEN
A MEMBER HALF AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY OF THE GROUP WHICH SURROUNDED JACQUIN
LABARRE AND HAD HIMSELF RELATED HIS DISAGREEABLE ENCOUNTER OF THE
MORNING TO THE PEOPLE AT THE CROSS OF COLBAS
FROM WHERE HE SAT HE MADE
AN IMPERCEPTIBLE SIGN TO THE TAVERN KEEPER
THE TAVERN KEEPER WENT TO
HIM
THEY EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS IN A LOW TONE
THE MAN HAD AGAIN BECOME
ABSORBED IN HIS REFLECTIONS
THE TAVERN KEEPER RETURNED TO THE FIREPLACE LAID HIS HAND ABRUPTLY ON
THE SHOULDER OF THE MAN AND SAID TO HIM
YOU ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE
THE STRANGER TURNED ROUND AND REPLIED GENTLY AH YOU KNOW
YES
I WAS SENT AWAY FROM THE OTHER INN
AND YOU ARE TO BE TURNED OUT OF THIS ONE
WHERE WOULD YOU HAVE ME GO
ELSEWHERE
THE MAN TOOK HIS STICK AND HIS KNAPSACK AND DEPARTED
AS HE WENT OUT SOME CHILDREN WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM FROM THE CROSS OF
COLBAS AND WHO SEEMED TO BE LYING IN WAIT FOR HIM THREW STONES AT HIM
HE RETRACED HIS STEPS IN ANGER AND THREATENED THEM WITH HIS STICK THE
CHILDREN DISPERSED LIKE A FLOCK OF BIRDS
HE PASSED BEFORE THE PRISON
AT THE DOOR HUNG AN IRON CHAIN ATTACHED TO
A BELL
HE RANG
THE WICKET OPENED
TURNKEY SAID HE REMOVING HIS CAP POLITELY WILL YOU HAVE THE
KINDNESS TO ADMIT ME AND GIVE ME A LODGING FOR THE NIGHT
A VOICE REPLIED
THE PRISON IS NOT AN INN
GET YOURSELF ARRESTED AND YOU WILL BE
ADMITTED
THE WICKET CLOSED AGAIN
HE ENTERED A LITTLE STREET IN WHICH THERE WERE MANY GARDENS
SOME OF
THEM ARE ENCLOSED ONLY BY HEDGES WHICH LENDS A CHEERFUL ASPECT TO THE
STREET
IN THE MIDST OF THESE GARDENS AND HEDGES HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A
SMALL HOUSE OF A SINGLE STORY THE WINDOW OF WHICH WAS LIGHTED UP
HE
PEERED THROUGH THE PANE AS HE HAD DONE AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE
WITHIN WAS A
LARGE WHITEWASHED ROOM WITH A BED DRAPED IN PRINTED COTTON STUFF AND
A CRADLE IN ONE CORNER A FEW WOODEN CHAIRS AND A DOUBLE BARRELLED GUN
HANGING ON THE WALL
A TABLE WAS SPREAD IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
A
COPPER LAMP ILLUMINATED THE TABLECLOTH OF COARSE WHITE LINEN THE PEWTER
JUG SHINING LIKE SILVER AND FILLED WITH WINE AND THE BROWN SMOKING
SOUP TUREEN
AT THIS TABLE SAT A MAN OF ABOUT FORTY WITH A MERRY AND
OPEN COUNTENANCE WHO WAS DANDLING A LITTLE CHILD ON HIS KNEES
CLOSE BY
A VERY YOUNG WOMAN WAS NURSING ANOTHER CHILD
THE FATHER WAS LAUGHING
THE CHILD WAS LAUGHING THE MOTHER WAS SMILING
THE STRANGER PAUSED A MOMENT IN REVERY BEFORE THIS TENDER AND CALMING
SPECTACLE
WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE WITHIN HIM HE ALONE COULD HAVE
TOLD
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE THOUGHT THAT THIS JOYOUS HOUSE WOULD BE
HOSPITABLE AND THAT IN A PLACE WHERE HE BEHELD SO MUCH HAPPINESS HE
WOULD FIND PERHAPS A LITTLE PITY
HE TAPPED ON THE PANE WITH A VERY SMALL AND FEEBLE KNOCK
THEY DID NOT HEAR HIM
HE TAPPED AGAIN
HE HEARD THE WOMAN SAY IT SEEMS TO ME HUSBAND THAT SOME ONE IS
KNOCKING
NO REPLIED THE HUSBAND
HE TAPPED A THIRD TIME
THE HUSBAND ROSE TOOK THE LAMP AND WENT TO THE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED
HE WAS A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE HALF PEASANT HALF ARTISAN
HE WORE A
HUGE LEATHER APRON WHICH REACHED TO HIS LEFT SHOULDER AND WHICH A
HAMMER A RED HANDKERCHIEF A POWDER HORN AND ALL SORTS OF OBJECTS
WHICH WERE UPHELD BY THE GIRDLE AS IN A POCKET CAUSED TO BULGE OUT
HE
CARRIED HIS HEAD THROWN BACKWARDS HIS SHIRT WIDELY OPENED AND TURNED
BACK DISPLAYED HIS BULL NECK WHITE AND BARE
HE HAD THICK EYELASHES
ENORMOUS BLACK WHISKERS PROMINENT EYES THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE
LIKE A SNOUT AND BESIDES ALL THIS THAT AIR OF BEING ON HIS OWN GROUND
WHICH IS INDESCRIBABLE
PARDON ME SIR SAID THE WAYFARER COULD YOU IN CONSIDERATION OF
PAYMENT GIVE ME A PLATE OF SOUP AND A CORNER OF THAT SHED YONDER IN THE
GARDEN IN WHICH TO SLEEP TELL ME CAN YOU FOR MONEY
WHO ARE YOU DEMANDED THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE
THE MAN REPLIED I HAVE JUST COME FROM PUY MOISSON
I HAVE WALKED ALL
DAY LONG
I HAVE TRAVELLED TWELVE LEAGUES
CAN YOU IF I PAY
I WOULD NOT REFUSE SAID THE PEASANT TO LODGE ANY RESPECTABLE MAN
WHO WOULD PAY ME
BUT WHY DO YOU NOT GO TO THE INN
THERE IS NO ROOM
BAH IMPOSSIBLE
THIS IS NEITHER A FAIR NOR A MARKET DAY
HAVE YOU BEEN
TO LABARRE
YES
WELL
THE TRAVELLER REPLIED WITH EMBARRASSMENT I DO NOT KNOW
HE DID NOT
RECEIVE ME
HAVE YOU BEEN TO WHAT'S HIS NAME'S IN THE RUE CHAFFAUT
THE STRANGER'S EMBARRASSMENT INCREASED HE STAMMERED HE DID NOT
RECEIVE ME EITHER
THE PEASANT'S COUNTENANCE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF DISTRUST HE SURVEYED
THE NEWCOMER FROM HEAD TO FEET AND SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED WITH A SORT OF
SHUDDER
ARE YOU THE MAN
HE CAST A FRESH GLANCE UPON THE STRANGER TOOK THREE STEPS BACKWARDS
PLACED THE LAMP ON THE TABLE AND TOOK HIS GUN DOWN FROM THE WALL
MEANWHILE AT THE WORDS ARE YOU THE MAN THE WOMAN HAD RISEN HAD
CLASPED HER TWO CHILDREN IN HER ARMS AND HAD TAKEN REFUGE PRECIPITATELY
BEHIND HER HUSBAND STARING IN TERROR AT THE STRANGER WITH HER BOSOM
UNCOVERED AND WITH FRIGHTENED EYES AS SHE MURMURED IN A LOW TONE
TSO MARAUDE 1
ALL THIS TOOK PLACE IN LESS TIME THAN IT REQUIRES TO PICTURE IT TO
ONE'S SELF
AFTER HAVING SCRUTINIZED THE MAN FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS AS ONE
SCRUTINIZES A VIPER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE RETURNED TO THE DOOR AND
SAID
CLEAR OUT
FOR PITY'S SAKE A GLASS OF WATER SAID THE MAN
A SHOT FROM MY GUN SAID THE PEASANT
THEN HE CLOSED THE DOOR VIOLENTLY AND THE MAN HEARD HIM SHOOT TWO LARGE
BOLTS
A MOMENT LATER THE WINDOW SHUTTER WAS CLOSED AND THE SOUND OF A
BAR OF IRON WHICH WAS PLACED AGAINST IT WAS AUDIBLE OUTSIDE
NIGHT CONTINUED TO FALL
A COLD WIND FROM THE ALPS WAS BLOWING
BY THE
LIGHT OF THE EXPIRING DAY THE STRANGER PERCEIVED IN ONE OF THE GARDENS
WHICH BORDERED THE STREET A SORT OF HUT WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TO BE
BUILT OF SODS
HE CLIMBED OVER THE WOODEN FENCE RESOLUTELY AND FOUND
HIMSELF IN THE GARDEN
HE APPROACHED THE HUT ITS DOOR CONSISTED OF A
VERY LOW AND NARROW APERTURE AND IT RESEMBLED THOSE BUILDINGS WHICH
ROAD LABORERS CONSTRUCT FOR THEMSELVES ALONG THE ROADS
HE THOUGHT
WITHOUT DOUBT THAT IT WAS IN FACT THE DWELLING OF A ROAD LABORER HE
WAS SUFFERING FROM COLD AND HUNGER BUT THIS WAS AT LEAST A SHELTER
FROM THE COLD
THIS SORT OF DWELLING IS NOT USUALLY OCCUPIED AT NIGHT
HE THREW HIMSELF FLAT ON HIS FACE AND CRAWLED INTO THE HUT
IT WAS WARM
THERE AND HE FOUND A TOLERABLY GOOD BED OF STRAW
HE LAY FOR A MOMENT
STRETCHED OUT ON THIS BED WITHOUT THE POWER TO MAKE A MOVEMENT SO
FATIGUED WAS HE
THEN AS THE KNAPSACK ON HIS BACK WAS IN HIS WAY AND
AS IT FURNISHED MOREOVER A PILLOW READY TO HIS HAND HE SET ABOUT
UNBUCKLING ONE OF THE STRAPS
AT THAT MOMENT A FEROCIOUS GROWL BECAME
AUDIBLE
HE RAISED HIS EYES
THE HEAD OF AN ENORMOUS DOG WAS OUTLINED IN
THE DARKNESS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HUT
IT WAS A DOG'S KENNEL
HE WAS HIMSELF VIGOROUS AND FORMIDABLE HE ARMED HIMSELF WITH HIS STAFF
MADE A SHIELD OF HIS KNAPSACK AND MADE HIS WAY OUT OF THE KENNEL IN THE
BEST WAY HE COULD NOT WITHOUT ENLARGING THE RENTS IN HIS RAGS
HE LEFT THE GARDEN IN THE SAME MANNER BUT BACKWARDS BEING OBLIGED
IN ORDER TO KEEP THE DOG RESPECTFUL TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THAT MANOEUVRE
WITH HIS STICK WHICH MASTERS IN THAT SORT OF FENCING DESIGNATE AS LA
ROSE COUVERTE
WHEN HE HAD NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY REPASSED THE FENCE AND FOUND
HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE STREET ALONE WITHOUT REFUGE WITHOUT SHELTER
WITHOUT A ROOF OVER HIS HEAD CHASED EVEN FROM THAT BED OF STRAW AND
FROM THAT MISERABLE KENNEL HE DROPPED RATHER THAN SEATED HIMSELF ON A
STONE AND IT APPEARS THAT A PASSER BY HEARD HIM EXCLAIM I AM NOT EVEN
A DOG
HE SOON ROSE AGAIN AND RESUMED HIS MARCH
HE WENT OUT OF THE TOWN
HOPING TO FIND SOME TREE OR HAYSTACK IN THE FIELDS WHICH WOULD AFFORD
HIM SHELTER
HE WALKED THUS FOR SOME TIME WITH HIS HEAD STILL DROOPING
WHEN HE FELT
HIMSELF FAR FROM EVERY HUMAN HABITATION HE RAISED HIS EYES AND GAZED
SEARCHINGLY ABOUT HIM
HE WAS IN A FIELD
BEFORE HIM WAS ONE OF THOSE
LOW HILLS COVERED WITH CLOSE CUT STUBBLE WHICH AFTER THE HARVEST
RESEMBLE SHAVED HEADS
THE HORIZON WAS PERFECTLY BLACK
THIS WAS NOT ALONE THE OBSCURITY OF
NIGHT IT WAS CAUSED BY VERY LOW HANGING CLOUDS WHICH SEEMED TO REST
UPON THE HILL ITSELF AND WHICH WERE MOUNTING AND FILLING THE WHOLE
SKY
MEANWHILE AS THE MOON WAS ABOUT TO RISE AND AS THERE WAS STILL
FLOATING IN THE ZENITH A REMNANT OF THE BRIGHTNESS OF TWILIGHT THESE
CLOUDS FORMED AT THE SUMMIT OF THE SKY A SORT OF WHITISH ARCH WHENCE A
GLEAM OF LIGHT FELL UPON THE EARTH
THE EARTH WAS THUS BETTER LIGHTED THAN THE SKY WHICH PRODUCES A
PARTICULARLY SINISTER EFFECT AND THE HILL WHOSE CONTOUR WAS POOR AND
MEAN WAS OUTLINED VAGUE AND WAN AGAINST THE GLOOMY HORIZON
THE WHOLE
EFFECT WAS HIDEOUS PETTY LUGUBRIOUS AND NARROW
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE FIELD OR ON THE HILL EXCEPT A DEFORMED TREE
WHICH WRITHED AND SHIVERED A FEW PACES DISTANT FROM THE WAYFARER
THIS MAN WAS EVIDENTLY VERY FAR FROM HAVING THOSE DELICATE HABITS OF
INTELLIGENCE AND SPIRIT WHICH RENDER ONE SENSIBLE TO THE MYSTERIOUS
ASPECTS OF THINGS NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THAT SKY
IN THAT HILL IN THAT PLAIN IN THAT TREE WHICH WAS SO PROFOUNDLY
DESOLATE THAT AFTER A MOMENT OF IMMOBILITY AND REVERY HE TURNED BACK
ABRUPTLY
THERE ARE INSTANTS WHEN NATURE SEEMS HOSTILE
HE RETRACED HIS STEPS THE GATES OF D WERE CLOSED
D WHICH HAD
SUSTAINED SIEGES DURING THE WARS OF RELIGION WAS STILL SURROUNDED
IN 1815 BY ANCIENT WALLS FLANKED BY SQUARE TOWERS WHICH HAVE BEEN
DEMOLISHED SINCE
HE PASSED THROUGH A BREACH AND ENTERED THE TOWN AGAIN
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
AS HE WAS NOT
ACQUAINTED WITH THE STREETS HE RECOMMENCED HIS WALK AT RANDOM
IN THIS WAY HE CAME TO THE PREFECTURE THEN TO THE SEMINARY
AS HE
PASSED THROUGH THE CATHEDRAL SQUARE HE SHOOK HIS FIST AT THE CHURCH
AT THE CORNER OF THIS SQUARE THERE IS A PRINTING ESTABLISHMENT
IT IS
THERE THAT THE PROCLAMATIONS OF THE EMPEROR AND OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD
TO THE ARMY BROUGHT FROM THE ISLAND OF ELBA AND DICTATED BY NAPOLEON
HIMSELF WERE PRINTED FOR THE FIRST TIME
WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE AND NO LONGER ENTERTAINING ANY HOPE HE LAY DOWN
ON A STONE BENCH WHICH STANDS AT THE DOORWAY OF THIS PRINTING OFFICE
AT THAT MOMENT AN OLD WOMAN CAME OUT OF THE CHURCH
SHE SAW THE MAN
STRETCHED OUT IN THE SHADOW
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE MY FRIEND SAID
SHE
HE ANSWERED HARSHLY AND ANGRILY AS YOU SEE MY GOOD WOMAN I AM
SLEEPING THE GOOD WOMAN WHO WAS WELL WORTHY THE NAME IN FACT WAS
THE MARQUISE DE R
ON THIS BENCH SHE WENT ON
I HAVE HAD A MATTRESS OF WOOD FOR NINETEEN YEARS SAID THE MAN
TO DAY I HAVE A MATTRESS OF STONE
YOU HAVE BEEN A SOLDIER
YES MY GOOD WOMAN A SOLDIER
WHY DO YOU NOT GO TO THE INN
BECAUSE I HAVE NO MONEY
ALAS SAID MADAME DE R I HAVE ONLY FOUR SOUS IN MY PURSE
GIVE IT TO ME ALL THE SAME
THE MAN TOOK THE FOUR SOUS
MADAME DE R CONTINUED YOU CANNOT
OBTAIN LODGINGS IN AN INN FOR SO SMALL A SUM
BUT HAVE YOU TRIED IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT THUS
YOU ARE COLD AND HUNGRY NO
DOUBT
SOME ONE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN YOU A LODGING OUT OF CHARITY
I HAVE KNOCKED AT ALL DOORS
WELL
I HAVE BEEN DRIVEN AWAY EVERYWHERE
THE GOOD WOMAN TOUCHED THE MAN'S ARM AND POINTED OUT TO HIM ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET A SMALL LOW HOUSE WHICH STOOD BESIDE THE
BISHOP'S PALACE
YOU HAVE KNOCKED AT ALL DOORS
YES
HAVE YOU KNOCKED AT THAT ONE
NO
KNOCK THERE
CHAPTER II PRUDENCE COUNSELLED TO WISDOM
THAT EVENING THE BISHOP OF D AFTER HIS PROMENADE THROUGH THE TOWN
REMAINED SHUT UP RATHER LATE IN HIS ROOM
HE WAS BUSY OVER A GREAT WORK
ON DUTIES WHICH WAS NEVER COMPLETED UNFORTUNATELY
HE WAS CAREFULLY
COMPILING EVERYTHING THAT THE FATHERS AND THE DOCTORS HAVE SAID ON THIS
IMPORTANT SUBJECT
HIS BOOK WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS FIRSTLY THE
DUTIES OF ALL SECONDLY THE DUTIES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL ACCORDING TO THE
CLASS TO WHICH HE BELONGS
THE DUTIES OF ALL ARE THE GREAT DUTIES
THERE
ARE FOUR OF THESE
SAINT MATTHEW POINTS THEM OUT DUTIES TOWARDS GOD
MATT
VI DUTIES TOWARDS ONE'S SELF MATT
V
29 30 DUTIES TOWARDS
ONE'S NEIGHBOR MATT
VII
12 DUTIES TOWARDS ANIMALS MATT
VI
20
25
AS FOR THE OTHER DUTIES THE BISHOP FOUND THEM POINTED OUT AND
PRESCRIBED ELSEWHERE TO SOVEREIGNS AND SUBJECTS IN THE EPISTLE TO THE
ROMANS TO MAGISTRATES TO WIVES TO MOTHERS TO YOUNG MEN BY SAINT
PETER TO HUSBANDS FATHERS CHILDREN AND SERVANTS IN THE EPISTLE
TO THE EPHESIANS TO THE FAITHFUL IN THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS TO
VIRGINS IN THE EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS
OUT OF THESE PRECEPTS HE WAS
LABORIOUSLY CONSTRUCTING A HARMONIOUS WHOLE WHICH HE DESIRED TO PRESENT
TO SOULS
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK HE WAS STILL AT WORK WRITING WITH A GOOD DEAL OF
INCONVENIENCE UPON LITTLE SQUARES OF PAPER WITH A BIG BOOK OPEN ON HIS
KNEES WHEN MADAME MAGLOIRE ENTERED ACCORDING TO HER WONT TO GET THE
SILVER WARE FROM THE CUPBOARD NEAR HIS BED
A MOMENT LATER THE BISHOP
KNOWING THAT THE TABLE WAS SET AND THAT HIS SISTER WAS PROBABLY
WAITING FOR HIM SHUT HIS BOOK ROSE FROM HIS TABLE AND ENTERED THE
DINING ROOM
THE DINING ROOM WAS AN OBLONG APARTMENT WITH A FIREPLACE WHICH HAD A
DOOR OPENING ON THE STREET AS WE HAVE SAID AND A WINDOW OPENING ON
THE GARDEN
MADAME MAGLOIRE WAS IN FACT JUST PUTTING THE LAST TOUCHES TO THE
TABLE
AS SHE PERFORMED THIS SERVICE SHE WAS CONVERSING WITH MADEMOISELLE
BAPTISTINE
A LAMP STOOD ON THE TABLE THE TABLE WAS NEAR THE FIREPLACE
A WOOD FIRE
WAS BURNING THERE
ONE CAN EASILY PICTURE TO ONE'S SELF THESE TWO WOMEN BOTH OF WHOM
WERE OVER SIXTY YEARS OF AGE
MADAME MAGLOIRE SMALL PLUMP VIVACIOUS
MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE GENTLE SLENDER FRAIL SOMEWHAT TALLER THAN HER
BROTHER DRESSED IN A GOWN OF PUCE COLORED SILK OF THE FASHION OF 1806
WHICH SHE HAD PURCHASED AT THAT DATE IN PARIS AND WHICH HAD LASTED
EVER SINCE
TO BORROW VULGAR PHRASES WHICH POSSESS THE MERIT OF GIVING
UTTERANCE IN A SINGLE WORD TO AN IDEA WHICH A WHOLE PAGE WOULD HARDLY
SUFFICE TO EXPRESS MADAME MAGLOIRE HAD THE AIR OF A PEASANT AND
MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE THAT OF A LADY
MADAME MAGLOIRE WORE A WHITE
QUILTED CAP A GOLD JEANNETTE CROSS ON A VELVET RIBBON UPON HER NECK
THE ONLY BIT OF FEMININE JEWELRY THAT THERE WAS IN THE HOUSE A VERY
WHITE FICHU PUFFING OUT FROM A GOWN OF COARSE BLACK WOOLLEN STUFF WITH
LARGE SHORT SLEEVES AN APRON OF COTTON CLOTH IN RED AND GREEN CHECKS
KNOTTED ROUND THE WAIST WITH A GREEN RIBBON WITH A STOMACHER OF THE
SAME ATTACHED BY TWO PINS AT THE UPPER CORNERS COARSE SHOES ON HER
FEET AND YELLOW STOCKINGS LIKE THE WOMEN OF MARSEILLES
MADEMOISELLE
BAPTISTINE'S GOWN WAS CUT ON THE PATTERNS OF 1806 WITH A SHORT WAIST
A NARROW SHEATH LIKE SKIRT PUFFED SLEEVES WITH FLAPS AND BUTTONS
SHE CONCEALED HER GRAY HAIR UNDER A FRIZZED WIG KNOWN AS THE BABY WIG
MADAME MAGLOIRE HAD AN INTELLIGENT VIVACIOUS AND KINDLY AIR THE TWO
CORNERS OF HER MOUTH UNEQUALLY RAISED AND HER UPPER LIP WHICH WAS
LARGER THAN THE LOWER IMPARTED TO HER A RATHER CRABBED AND IMPERIOUS
LOOK
SO LONG AS MONSEIGNEUR HELD HIS PEACE SHE TALKED TO HIM
RESOLUTELY WITH A MIXTURE OF RESPECT AND FREEDOM BUT AS SOON AS
MONSEIGNEUR BEGAN TO SPEAK AS WE HAVE SEEN SHE OBEYED PASSIVELY LIKE
HER MISTRESS
MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE DID NOT EVEN SPEAK
SHE CONFINED
HERSELF TO OBEYING AND PLEASING HIM
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN PRETTY EVEN
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG SHE HAD LARGE BLUE PROMINENT EYES AND A LONG
ARCHED NOSE BUT HER WHOLE VISAGE HER WHOLE PERSON BREATHED FORTH AN
INEFFABLE GOODNESS AS WE STATED IN THE BEGINNING
SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN
PREDESTINED TO GENTLENESS BUT FAITH CHARITY HOPE THOSE THREE VIRTUES
WHICH MILDLY WARM THE SOUL HAD GRADUALLY ELEVATED THAT GENTLENESS TO
SANCTITY
NATURE HAD MADE HER A LAMB RELIGION HAD MADE HER AN ANGEL
POOR SAINTED VIRGIN SWEET MEMORY WHICH HAS VANISHED
MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE HAS SO OFTEN NARRATED WHAT PASSED AT THE
EPISCOPAL RESIDENCE THAT EVENING THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE NOW LIVING
WHO STILL RECALL THE MOST MINUTE DETAILS
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE BISHOP ENTERED MADAME MAGLOIRE WAS TALKING WITH
CONSIDERABLE VIVACITY
SHE WAS HARANGUING MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE ON
A SUBJECT WHICH WAS FAMILIAR TO HER AND TO WHICH THE BISHOP WAS ALSO
ACCUSTOMED
THE QUESTION CONCERNED THE LOCK UPON THE ENTRANCE DOOR
IT APPEARS THAT WHILE PROCURING SOME PROVISIONS FOR SUPPER MADAME
MAGLOIRE HAD HEARD THINGS IN DIVERS PLACES
PEOPLE HAD SPOKEN OF A
PROWLER OF EVIL APPEARANCE A SUSPICIOUS VAGABOND HAD ARRIVED WHO MUST
BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE TOWN AND THOSE WHO SHOULD TAKE IT INTO THEIR
HEADS TO RETURN HOME LATE THAT NIGHT MIGHT BE SUBJECTED TO UNPLEASANT
ENCOUNTERS
THE POLICE WAS VERY BADLY ORGANIZED MOREOVER BECAUSE THERE
WAS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THE PREFECT AND THE MAYOR WHO SOUGHT TO INJURE
EACH OTHER BY MAKING THINGS HAPPEN
IT BEHOOVED WISE PEOPLE TO PLAY THE
PART OF THEIR OWN POLICE AND TO GUARD THEMSELVES WELL AND CARE MUST BE
TAKEN TO DULY CLOSE BAR AND BARRICADE THEIR HOUSES AND TO FASTEN THE
DOORS WELL
MADAME MAGLOIRE EMPHASIZED THESE LAST WORDS BUT THE BISHOP HAD JUST
COME FROM HIS ROOM WHERE IT WAS RATHER COLD
HE SEATED HIMSELF IN FRONT
OF THE FIRE AND WARMED HIMSELF AND THEN FELL TO THINKING OF OTHER
THINGS
HE DID NOT TAKE UP THE REMARK DROPPED WITH DESIGN BY MADAME
MAGLOIRE
SHE REPEATED IT
THEN MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE DESIROUS OF
SATISFYING MADAME MAGLOIRE WITHOUT DISPLEASING HER BROTHER VENTURED TO
SAY TIMIDLY
DID YOU HEAR WHAT MADAME MAGLOIRE IS SAYING BROTHER
I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF IT IN A VAGUE WAY REPLIED THE BISHOP
THEN
HALF TURNING IN HIS CHAIR PLACING HIS HANDS ON HIS KNEES AND RAISING
TOWARDS THE OLD SERVANT WOMAN HIS CORDIAL FACE WHICH SO EASILY GREW
JOYOUS AND WHICH WAS ILLUMINATED FROM BELOW BY THE FIRELIGHT COME
WHAT IS THE MATTER WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE WE IN ANY GREAT DANGER
THEN MADAME MAGLOIRE BEGAN THE WHOLE STORY AFRESH EXAGGERATING IT A
LITTLE WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF THE FACT
IT APPEARED THAT A BOHEMIAN A
BARE FOOTED VAGABOND A SORT OF DANGEROUS MENDICANT WAS AT THAT MOMENT
IN THE TOWN
HE HAD PRESENTED HIMSELF AT JACQUIN LABARRE'S TO OBTAIN
LODGINGS BUT THE LATTER HAD NOT BEEN WILLING TO TAKE HIM IN
HE HAD
BEEN SEEN TO ARRIVE BY THE WAY OF THE BOULEVARD GASSENDI AND ROAM ABOUT
THE STREETS IN THE GLOAMING
A GALLOWS BIRD WITH A TERRIBLE FACE
REALLY SAID THE BISHOP
THIS WILLINGNESS TO INTERROGATE ENCOURAGED MADAME MAGLOIRE IT SEEMED
TO HER TO INDICATE THAT THE BISHOP WAS ON THE POINT OF BECOMING ALARMED
SHE PURSUED TRIUMPHANTLY
YES MONSEIGNEUR
THAT IS HOW IT IS
THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF
CATASTROPHE IN THIS TOWN TO NIGHT
EVERY ONE SAYS SO
AND WITHAL THE
POLICE IS SO BADLY REGULATED A USEFUL REPETITION
THE IDEA OF LIVING
IN A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY AND NOT EVEN HAVING LIGHTS IN THE STREETS AT
NIGHT ONE GOES OUT
BLACK AS OVENS INDEED AND I SAY MONSEIGNEUR AND
MADEMOISELLE THERE SAYS WITH ME
I INTERRUPTED HIS SISTER SAY NOTHING
WHAT MY BROTHER DOES IS WELL
DONE
MADAME MAGLOIRE CONTINUED AS THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN NO PROTEST
WE SAY THAT THIS HOUSE IS NOT SAFE AT ALL THAT IF MONSEIGNEUR WILL
PERMIT I WILL GO AND TELL PAULIN MUSEBOIS THE LOCKSMITH TO COME AND
REPLACE THE ANCIENT LOCKS ON THE DOORS WE HAVE THEM AND IT IS ONLY THE
WORK OF A MOMENT FOR I SAY THAT NOTHING IS MORE TERRIBLE THAN A
DOOR WHICH CAN BE OPENED FROM THE OUTSIDE WITH A LATCH BY THE FIRST
PASSER BY AND I SAY THAT WE NEED BOLTS MONSEIGNEUR IF ONLY FOR THIS
NIGHT MOREOVER MONSEIGNEUR HAS THE HABIT OF ALWAYS SAYING 'COME IN'
AND BESIDES EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT O MON DIEU THERE IS NO
NEED TO ASK PERMISSION
AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME A TOLERABLY VIOLENT KNOCK ON THE DOOR
COME IN SAID THE BISHOP
CHAPTER III THE HEROISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE
THE DOOR OPENED
IT OPENED WIDE WITH A RAPID MOVEMENT AS THOUGH SOME ONE HAD GIVEN IT AN
ENERGETIC AND RESOLUTE PUSH
A MAN ENTERED
WE ALREADY KNOW THE MAN
IT WAS THE WAYFARER WHOM WE HAVE SEEN WANDERING
ABOUT IN SEARCH OF SHELTER
HE ENTERED ADVANCED A STEP AND HALTED LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN BEHIND
HIM
HE HAD HIS KNAPSACK ON HIS SHOULDERS HIS CUDGEL IN HIS HAND A
ROUGH AUDACIOUS WEARY AND VIOLENT EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES
THE FIRE ON
THE HEARTH LIGHTED HIM UP
HE WAS HIDEOUS
IT WAS A SINISTER APPARITION
MADAME MAGLOIRE HAD NOT EVEN THE STRENGTH TO UTTER A CRY
SHE TREMBLED
AND STOOD WITH HER MOUTH WIDE OPEN
MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE TURNED ROUND BEHELD THE MAN ENTERING AND HALF
STARTED UP IN TERROR THEN TURNING HER HEAD BY DEGREES TOWARDS THE
FIREPLACE AGAIN SHE BEGAN TO OBSERVE HER BROTHER AND HER FACE BECAME
ONCE MORE PROFOUNDLY CALM AND SERENE
THE BISHOP FIXED A TRANQUIL EYE ON THE MAN
AS HE OPENED HIS MOUTH DOUBTLESS TO ASK THE NEW COMER WHAT HE DESIRED
THE MAN RESTED BOTH HANDS ON HIS STAFF DIRECTED HIS GAZE AT THE OLD MAN
AND THE TWO WOMEN AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE BISHOP TO SPEAK HE SAID
IN A LOUD VOICE
SEE HERE
MY NAME IS JEAN VALJEAN
I AM A CONVICT FROM THE GALLEYS
I HAVE PASSED NINETEEN YEARS IN THE GALLEYS
I WAS LIBERATED FOUR DAYS
AGO AND AM ON MY WAY TO PONTARLIER WHICH IS MY DESTINATION

THEY SAID TO ME 'BE OFF AT BOTH PLACES

I WENT INTO A DOG'S
KENNEL THE DOG BIT ME AND CHASED ME OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN A MAN
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE KNEW WHO I WAS
I WENT INTO THE FIELDS
INTENDING TO SLEEP IN THE OPEN AIR BENEATH THE STARS
THERE WERE NO
STARS
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO RAIN AND I RE ENTERED THE TOWN TO
SEEK THE RECESS OF A DOORWAY
YONDER IN THE SQUARE I MEANT TO SLEEP
ON A STONE BENCH
A GOOD WOMAN POINTED OUT YOUR HOUSE TO ME AND SAID
TO ME 'KNOCK THERE I HAVE KNOCKED

MADAME MAGLOIRE SAID THE BISHOP YOU WILL SET ANOTHER PLACE

THE TABLE
STOP HE RESUMED AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT QUITE UNDERSTOOD
THAT'S NOT IT
DID YOU HEAR I AM A GALLEY SLAVE A CONVICT
I COME
FROM THE GALLEYS HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A LARGE SHEET OF YELLOW
PAPER WHICH HE UNFOLDED
HERE'S MY PASSPORT

SOMETHING TO EAT AND A BED HAVE YOU A STABLE
MADAME MAGLOIRE SAID THE BISHOP YOU WILL PUT WHITE SHEETS ON THE
BED IN THE ALCOVE WE HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED THE CHARACTER OF THE TWO
WOMEN'S OBEDIENCE
MADAME MAGLOIRE RETIRED TO EXECUTE THESE ORDERS
THE BISHOP TURNED TO THE MAN
SIT DOWN SIR AND WARM YOURSELF
WE ARE GOING TO SUP IN A FEW MOMENTS
AND YOUR BED WILL BE PREPARED WHILE YOU ARE SUPPING
AT THIS POINT THE MAN SUDDENLY COMPREHENDED
THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE
UP TO THAT TIME SOMBRE AND HARSH BORE THE IMPRINT OF STUPEFACTION
OF DOUBT OF JOY AND BECAME EXTRAORDINARY
HE BEGAN STAMMERING LIKE A
CRAZY MAN

SKULL CAP
AS HE SPOKE HE DEPOSITED HIS KNAPSACK AND HIS CUDGEL IN A CORNER
REPLACED HIS PASSPORT IN HIS POCKET AND SEATED HIMSELF
MADEMOISELLE
BAPTISTINE GAZED MILDLY AT HIM

WAGONS AT GRASSE
SINCE YOU ARE AN ABBE I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE HAD A
CHAPLAIN IN THE GALLEYS
AND ONE DAY I SAW A BISHOP THERE
MONSEIGNEUR
IS WHAT THEY CALL HIM
HE WAS THE BISHOP OF MAJORE AT MARSEILLES
HE IS
THE CURE WHO RULES OVER THE OTHER CURES YOU UNDERSTAND
PARDON ME
I SAY THAT VERY BADLY BUT IT IS SUCH A FAR OFF THING TO ME YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE HE SAID MASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GALLEYS ON AN
ALTAR
HE HAD A POINTED THING MADE OF GOLD ON HIS HEAD IT GLITTERED
IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF MIDDAY
WE WERE ALL RANGED IN LINES ON THE THREE
SIDES WITH CANNONS WITH LIGHTED MATCHES FACING US
WE COULD NOT SEE
VERY WELL
HE SPOKE BUT HE WAS TOO FAR OFF AND WE DID NOT HEAR
THAT
IS WHAT A BISHOP IS LIKE
WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING THE BISHOP HAD GONE AND SHUT THE DOOR WHICH HAD
REMAINED WIDE OPEN
MADAME MAGLOIRE RETURNED
SHE BROUGHT A SILVER FORK AND SPOON WHICH SHE
PLACED ON THE TABLE
MADAME MAGLOIRE SAID THE BISHOP PLACE THOSE THINGS AS NEAR THE FIRE
AS POSSIBLE AND TURNING TO HIS GUEST THE NIGHT WIND IS HARSH ON THE
ALPS
YOU MUST BE COLD SIR
EACH TIME THAT HE UTTERED THE WORD SIR IN HIS VOICE WHICH WAS SO GENTLY
GRAVE AND POLISHED THE MAN'S FACE LIGHTED UP
MONSIEUR TO A CONVICT IS
LIKE A GLASS OF WATER TO ONE OF THE SHIPWRECKED OF THE MEDUSA
IGNOMINY
THIRSTS FOR CONSIDERATION
THIS LAMP GIVES A VERY BAD LIGHT SAID THE BISHOP
MADAME MAGLOIRE UNDERSTOOD HIM AND WENT TO GET THE TWO SILVER
CANDLESTICKS FROM THE CHIMNEY PIECE IN MONSEIGNEUR'S BED CHAMBER AND
PLACED THEM LIGHTED ON THE TABLE
MONSIEUR LE CURE SAID THE MAN YOU ARE GOOD YOU DO NOT DESPISE ME
YOU RECEIVE ME INTO YOUR HOUSE
YOU LIGHT YOUR CANDLES FOR ME
YET I
HAVE NOT CONCEALED FROM YOU WHENCE I COME AND THAT I AM AN UNFORTUNATE
MAN
THE BISHOP WHO WAS SITTING CLOSE TO HIM GENTLY TOUCHED HIS HAND
YOU
COULD NOT HELP TELLING ME WHO YOU WERE
THIS IS NOT MY HOUSE IT IS
THE HOUSE OF JESUS CHRIST
THIS DOOR DOES NOT DEMAND OF HIM WHO ENTERS
WHETHER HE HAS A NAME BUT WHETHER HE HAS A GRIEF
YOU SUFFER YOU ARE
HUNGRY AND THIRSTY YOU ARE WELCOME
AND DO NOT THANK ME DO NOT SAY
THAT I RECEIVE YOU IN MY HOUSE
NO ONE IS AT HOME HERE EXCEPT THE MAN

NOW THERE IS THE YELLOW
PASSPORT
THAT IS WHAT IT IS LIKE
YES RESUMED THE BISHOP YOU HAVE COME FROM A VERY SAD PLACE
LISTEN
THERE WILL BE MORE JOY IN HEAVEN OVER THE TEAR BATHED FACE OF A
REPENTANT SINNER THAN OVER THE WHITE ROBES OF A HUNDRED JUST MEN
IF YOU
EMERGE FROM THAT SAD PLACE WITH THOUGHTS OF HATRED AND OF WRATH AGAINST
MANKIND YOU ARE DESERVING OF PITY IF YOU EMERGE WITH THOUGHTS OF
GOOD WILL AND OF PEACE YOU ARE MORE WORTHY THAN ANY ONE OF US
IN THE MEANTIME MADAME MAGLOIRE HAD SERVED SUPPER SOUP MADE WITH
WATER OIL BREAD AND SALT A LITTLE BACON A BIT OF MUTTON FIGS A
FRESH CHEESE AND A LARGE LOAF OF RYE BREAD
SHE HAD OF HER OWN ACCORD
ADDED TO THE BISHOP'S ORDINARY FARE A BOTTLE OF HIS OLD MAUVES WINE
THE BISHOP'S FACE AT ONCE ASSUMED THAT EXPRESSION OF GAYETY WHICH IS
PECULIAR TO HOSPITABLE NATURES
TO TABLE HE CRIED VIVACIOUSLY
AS WAS
HIS CUSTOM WHEN A STRANGER SUPPED WITH HIM HE MADE THE MAN SIT ON HIS
RIGHT
MADEMOISELLE BAPTISTINE PERFECTLY PEACEABLE AND NATURAL TOOK
HER SEAT AT HIS LEFT
THE BISHOP ASKED A BLESSING THEN HELPED THE SOUP HIMSELF ACCORDING TO
HIS CUSTOM
THE MAN BEGAN TO EAT WITH AVIDITY
ALL AT ONCE THE BISHOP SAID IT STRIKES ME THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING
ON THIS TABLE
MADAME MAGLOIRE HAD IN FACT ONLY PLACED THE THREE SETS OF FORKS AND
SPOONS WHICH WERE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
NOW IT WAS THE USAGE OF THE
HOUSE WHEN THE BISHOP HAD ANY ONE TO SUPPER TO LAY OUT THE WHOLE
SIX SETS OF SILVER ON THE TABLE CLOTH AN INNOCENT OSTENTATION
THIS
GRACEFUL SEMBLANCE OF LUXURY WAS A KIND OF CHILD'S PLAY WHICH WAS FULL
OF CHARM IN THAT GENTLE AND SEVERE HOUSEHOLD WHICH RAISED POVERTY INTO
DIGNITY
MADAME MAGLOIRE UNDERSTOOD THE REMARK WENT OUT WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
AND A MOMENT LATER THE THREE SETS OF SILVER FORKS AND SPOONS DEMANDED BY
THE BISHOP WERE GLITTERING UPON THE CLOTH SYMMETRICALLY ARRANGED BEFORE
THE THREE PERSONS SEATED AT THE TABLE
CHAPTER IV DETAILS CONCERNING THE CHEESE DAIRIES OF PONTARLIER
NOW IN ORDER TO CONVEY AN IDEA OF WHAT PASSED AT THAT TABLE WE CANNOT
DO BETTER THAN TO TRANSCRIBE HERE A PASSAGE FROM ONE OF MADEMOISELLE
BAPTISTINE'S LETTERS TO MADAME BOISCHEVRON WHEREIN THE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN THE CONVICT AND THE BISHOP IS DESCRIBED WITH INGENIOUS
MINUTENESS
THIS MAN PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANY ONE
HE ATE WITH THE VORACITY
OF A STARVING MAN
HOWEVER AFTER SUPPER HE SAID
'MONSIEUR LE CURE OF THE GOOD GOD ALL THIS IS FAR TOO GOOD FOR ME BUT
I MUST SAY THAT THE CARTERS WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO EAT WITH THEM KEEP
A BETTER TABLE THAN YOU DO
BETWEEN OURSELVES THE REMARK RATHER SHOCKED ME
MY BROTHER REPLIED
'THEY ARE MORE FATIGUED THAN I
'NO RETURNED THE MAN 'THEY HAVE MORE MONEY
YOU ARE POOR I SEE THAT
PLAINLY
YOU CANNOT BE EVEN A CURATE
ARE YOU REALLY A CURE AH IF THE
GOOD GOD WERE BUT JUST YOU CERTAINLY OUGHT TO BE A CURE
'THE GOOD GOD IS MORE THAN JUST SAID MY BROTHER
A MOMENT LATER HE ADDED
'MONSIEUR JEAN VALJEAN IS IT TO PONTARLIER THAT YOU ARE GOING
'WITH MY ROAD MARKED OUT FOR ME
I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE MAN SAID
THEN HE WENT ON
'I MUST BE ON MY WAY BY DAYBREAK TO MORROW
TRAVELLING IS HARD
IF THE
NIGHTS ARE COLD THE DAYS ARE HOT
'YOU ARE GOING TO A GOOD COUNTRY SAID MY BROTHER
'DURING THE
REVOLUTION MY FAMILY WAS RUINED
I TOOK REFUGE IN FRANCHE COMTE AT
FIRST AND THERE I LIVED FOR SOME TIME BY THE TOIL OF MY HANDS
MY WILL
WAS GOOD
I FOUND PLENTY TO OCCUPY ME
ONE HAS ONLY TO CHOOSE
THERE ARE
PAPER MILLS TANNERIES DISTILLERIES OIL FACTORIES WATCH FACTORIES
ON A LARGE SCALE STEEL MILLS COPPER WORKS TWENTY IRON FOUNDRIES AT
LEAST FOUR OF WHICH SITUATED AT LODS AT CHATILLON AT AUDINCOURT AND
AT BEURE ARE TOLERABLY LARGE
I THINK I AM NOT MISTAKEN IN SAYING THAT THOSE ARE THE NAMES WHICH MY
BROTHER MENTIONED
THEN HE INTERRUPTED HIMSELF AND ADDRESSED ME
'HAVE WE NOT SOME RELATIVES IN THOSE PARTS MY DEAR SISTER
I REPLIED
'WE DID HAVE SOME AMONG OTHERS M
DE LUCENET WHO WAS CAPTAIN OF THE
GATES AT PONTARLIER UNDER THE OLD REGIME
'YES RESUMED MY BROTHER 'BUT IN '93 ONE HAD NO LONGER ANY
RELATIVES ONE HAD ONLY ONE'S ARMS
I WORKED
THEY HAVE IN THE
COUNTRY OF PONTARLIER WHITHER YOU ARE GOING MONSIEUR VALJEAN A
TRULY PATRIARCHAL AND TRULY CHARMING INDUSTRY MY SISTER
IT IS THEIR
CHEESE DAIRIES WHICH THEY CALL FRUITIERES
THEN MY BROTHER WHILE URGING THE MAN TO EAT EXPLAINED TO HIM WITH
GREAT MINUTENESS WHAT THESE FRUITIERES OF PONTARLIER WERE THAT THEY
WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE BIG BARNS WHICH BELONG TO THE RICH
AND WHERE THERE ARE FORTY OR FIFTY COWS WHICH PRODUCE FROM SEVEN TO
EIGHT THOUSAND CHEESES EACH SUMMER AND THE ASSOCIATED FRUITIERES WHICH
BELONG TO THE POOR THESE ARE THE PEASANTS OF MID MOUNTAIN WHO HOLD
THEIR COWS IN COMMON AND SHARE THE PROCEEDS
'THEY ENGAGE THE SERVICES
OF A CHEESE MAKER WHOM THEY CALL THE GRURIN THE GRURIN RECEIVES THE
MILK OF THE ASSOCIATES THREE TIMES A DAY AND MARKS THE QUANTITY ON
A DOUBLE TALLY
IT IS TOWARDS THE END OF APRIL THAT THE WORK OF THE
CHEESE DAIRIES BEGINS IT IS TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF JUNE THAT THE
CHEESE MAKERS DRIVE THEIR COWS TO THE MOUNTAINS
THE MAN RECOVERED HIS ANIMATION AS HE ATE
MY BROTHER MADE HIM DRINK
THAT GOOD MAUVES WINE WHICH HE DOES NOT DRINK HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAYS
THAT WINE IS EXPENSIVE
MY BROTHER IMPARTED ALL THESE DETAILS WITH THAT
EASY GAYETY OF HIS WITH WHICH YOU ARE ACQUAINTED INTERSPERSING HIS
WORDS WITH GRACEFUL ATTENTIONS TO ME
HE RECURRED FREQUENTLY TO THAT
COMFORTABLE TRADE OF GRURIN AS THOUGH HE WISHED THE MAN TO UNDERSTAND
WITHOUT ADVISING HIM DIRECTLY AND HARSHLY THAT THIS WOULD AFFORD HIM
A REFUGE
ONE THING STRUCK ME
THIS MAN WAS WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU
WELL
NEITHER DURING SUPPER NOR DURING THE ENTIRE EVENING DID MY BROTHER
UTTER A SINGLE WORD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW WORDS ABOUT JESUS WHEN
HE ENTERED WHICH COULD REMIND THE MAN OF WHAT HE WAS NOR OF WHAT MY
BROTHER WAS
TO ALL APPEARANCES IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR PREACHING HIM
A LITTLE SERMON AND OF IMPRESSING THE BISHOP ON THE CONVICT SO THAT A
MARK OF THE PASSAGE MIGHT REMAIN BEHIND
THIS MIGHT HAVE APPEARED TO ANY
ONE ELSE WHO HAD THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN IN HIS HANDS TO AFFORD A CHANCE
TO NOURISH HIS SOUL AS WELL AS HIS BODY AND TO BESTOW UPON HIM
SOME REPROACH SEASONED WITH MORALIZING AND ADVICE OR A LITTLE
COMMISERATION WITH AN EXHORTATION TO CONDUCT HIMSELF BETTER IN THE
FUTURE
MY BROTHER DID NOT EVEN ASK HIM FROM WHAT COUNTRY HE CAME
NOR WHAT WAS HIS HISTORY
FOR IN HIS HISTORY THERE IS A FAULT AND MY
BROTHER SEEMED TO AVOID EVERYTHING WHICH COULD REMIND HIM OF IT
TO SUCH
A POINT DID HE CARRY IT THAT AT ONE TIME WHEN MY BROTHER WAS SPEAKING
OF THE MOUNTAINEERS OF PONTARLIER WHO EXERCISE A GENTLE LABOR NEAR
HEAVEN AND WHO HE ADDED ARE HAPPY BECAUSE THEY ARE INNOCENT HE
STOPPED SHORT FEARING LEST IN THIS REMARK THERE MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED HIM
SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT WOUND THE MAN
BY DINT OF REFLECTION I THINK
I HAVE COMPREHENDED WHAT WAS PASSING IN MY BROTHER'S HEART
HE WAS
THINKING NO DOUBT THAT THIS MAN WHOSE NAME IS JEAN VALJEAN HAD HIS
MISFORTUNE ONLY TOO VIVIDLY PRESENT IN HIS MIND THAT THE BEST THING
WAS TO DIVERT HIM FROM IT AND TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE IF ONLY MOMENTARILY
THAT HE WAS A PERSON LIKE ANY OTHER BY TREATING HIM JUST IN HIS
ORDINARY WAY
IS NOT THIS INDEED TO UNDERSTAND CHARITY WELL IS THERE
NOT DEAR MADAME SOMETHING TRULY EVANGELICAL IN THIS DELICACY WHICH
ABSTAINS FROM SERMON FROM MORALIZING FROM ALLUSIONS AND IS NOT THE
TRUEST PITY WHEN A MAN HAS A SORE POINT NOT TO TOUCH IT AT ALL IT HAS
SEEMED TO ME THAT THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN MY BROTHER'S PRIVATE THOUGHT
IN
ANY CASE WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT IF HE ENTERTAINED ALL THESE IDEAS HE
GAVE NO SIGN OF THEM FROM BEGINNING TO END EVEN TO ME HE WAS THE SAME
AS HE IS EVERY EVENING AND HE SUPPED WITH THIS JEAN VALJEAN WITH THE
SAME AIR AND IN THE SAME MANNER IN WHICH HE WOULD HAVE SUPPED WITH M
GEDEON LE PROVOST OR WITH THE CURATE OF THE PARISH
TOWARDS THE END WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE FIGS THERE CAME A KNOCK AT
THE DOOR
IT WAS MOTHER GERBAUD WITH HER LITTLE ONE IN HER ARMS
MY
BROTHER KISSED THE CHILD ON THE BROW AND BORROWED FIFTEEN SOUS WHICH I
HAD ABOUT ME TO GIVE TO MOTHER GERBAUD
THE MAN WAS NOT PAYING MUCH
HEED TO ANYTHING THEN
HE WAS NO LONGER TALKING AND HE SEEMED VERY MUCH
FATIGUED
AFTER POOR OLD GERBAUD HAD TAKEN HER DEPARTURE MY BROTHER
SAID GRACE THEN HE TURNED TO THE MAN AND SAID TO HIM 'YOU MUST BE
IN GREAT NEED OF YOUR BED MADAME MAGLOIRE CLEARED THE TABLE VERY
PROMPTLY
I UNDERSTOOD THAT WE MUST RETIRE IN ORDER TO ALLOW THIS
TRAVELLER TO GO TO SLEEP AND WE BOTH WENT UP STAIRS
NEVERTHELESS I
SENT MADAME MAGLOIRE DOWN A MOMENT LATER TO CARRY TO THE MAN'S BED A
GOAT SKIN FROM THE BLACK FOREST WHICH WAS IN MY ROOM
THE NIGHTS ARE
FRIGID AND THAT KEEPS ONE WARM
IT IS A PITY THAT THIS SKIN IS OLD ALL
THE HAIR IS FALLING OUT
MY BROTHER BOUGHT IT WHILE HE WAS IN GERMANY
AT TOTTLINGEN NEAR THE SOURCES OF THE DANUBE AS WELL AS THE LITTLE
IVORY HANDLED KNIFE WHICH I USE AT TABLE
MADAME MAGLOIRE RETURNED IMMEDIATELY
WE SAID OUR PRAYERS IN THE
DRAWING ROOM WHERE WE HANG UP THE LINEN AND THEN WE EACH RETIRED TO
OUR OWN CHAMBERS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO EACH OTHER
CHAPTER V TRANQUILLITY
AFTER BIDDING HIS SISTER GOOD NIGHT MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU TOOK ONE OF
THE TWO SILVER CANDLESTICKS FROM THE TABLE HANDED THE OTHER TO HIS
GUEST AND SAID TO HIM
MONSIEUR I WILL CONDUCT YOU TO YOUR ROOM
THE MAN FOLLOWED HIM
AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOVE THE HOUSE WAS
SO ARRANGED THAT IN ORDER TO PASS INTO THE ORATORY WHERE THE ALCOVE WAS
SITUATED OR TO GET OUT OF IT IT WAS NECESSARY TO TRAVERSE THE BISHOP'S
BEDROOM
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE WAS CROSSING THIS APARTMENT MADAME MAGLOIRE WAS
PUTTING AWAY THE SILVERWARE IN THE CUPBOARD NEAR THE HEAD OF THE BED
THIS WAS HER LAST CARE EVERY EVENING BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED
THE BISHOP INSTALLED HIS GUEST IN THE ALCOVE
A FRESH WHITE BED HAD BEEN
PREPARED THERE
THE MAN SET THE CANDLE DOWN ON A SMALL TABLE
WELL SAID THE BISHOP MAY YOU PASS A GOOD NIGHT
TO MORROW MORNING
BEFORE YOU SET OUT YOU SHALL DRINK A CUP OF WARM MILK FROM OUR COWS
THANKS MONSIEUR L'ABBE SAID THE MAN
HARDLY HAD HE PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS FULL OF PEACE WHEN ALL OF A
SUDDEN AND WITHOUT TRANSITION HE MADE A STRANGE MOVEMENT WHICH WOULD
HAVE FROZEN THE TWO SAINTED WOMEN WITH HORROR HAD THEY WITNESSED IT
EVEN AT THIS DAY IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO EXPLAIN WHAT INSPIRED HIM AT
THAT MOMENT
DID HE INTEND TO CONVEY A WARNING OR TO THROW OUT A MENACE
WAS HE SIMPLY OBEYING A SORT OF INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE WHICH WAS OBSCURE
EVEN TO HIMSELF HE TURNED ABRUPTLY TO THE OLD MAN FOLDED HIS ARMS AND
BENDING UPON HIS HOST A SAVAGE GAZE HE EXCLAIMED IN A HOARSE VOICE
AH REALLY YOU LODGE ME IN YOUR HOUSE CLOSE TO YOURSELF LIKE THIS
HE BROKE OFF AND ADDED WITH A LAUGH IN WHICH THERE LURKED SOMETHING
MONSTROUS
HAVE YOU REALLY REFLECTED WELL HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN AN
ASSASSIN
THE BISHOP REPLIED
THAT IS THE CONCERN OF THE GOOD GOD
THEN GRAVELY AND MOVING HIS LIPS LIKE ONE WHO IS PRAYING OR TALKING
TO HIMSELF HE RAISED TWO FINGERS OF HIS RIGHT HAND AND BESTOWED HIS
BENEDICTION ON THE MAN WHO DID NOT BOW AND WITHOUT TURNING HIS HEAD OR
LOOKING BEHIND HIM HE RETURNED TO HIS BEDROOM
WHEN THE ALCOVE WAS IN USE A LARGE SERGE CURTAIN DRAWN FROM WALL TO
WALL CONCEALED THE ALTAR
THE BISHOP KNELT BEFORE THIS CURTAIN AS HE
PASSED AND SAID A BRIEF PRAYER
A MOMENT LATER HE WAS IN HIS GARDEN
WALKING MEDITATING CONTEMPLATING HIS HEART AND SOUL WHOLLY ABSORBED
IN THOSE GRAND AND MYSTERIOUS THINGS WHICH GOD SHOWS AT NIGHT TO THE
EYES WHICH REMAIN OPEN
AS FOR THE MAN HE WAS ACTUALLY SO FATIGUED THAT HE DID NOT EVEN PROFIT
BY THE NICE WHITE SHEETS
SNUFFING OUT HIS CANDLE WITH HIS NOSTRILS
AFTER THE MANNER OF CONVICTS HE DROPPED ALL DRESSED AS HE WAS UPON
THE BED WHERE HE IMMEDIATELY FELL INTO A PROFOUND SLEEP
MIDNIGHT STRUCK AS THE BISHOP RETURNED FROM HIS GARDEN TO HIS APARTMENT
A FEW MINUTES LATER ALL WERE ASLEEP IN THE LITTLE HOUSE
CHAPTER VI JEAN VALJEAN
TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT JEAN VALJEAN WOKE
JEAN VALJEAN CAME FROM A POOR PEASANT FAMILY OF BRIE
HE HAD NOT LEARNED
TO READ IN HIS CHILDHOOD
WHEN HE REACHED MAN'S ESTATE HE BECAME A
TREE PRUNER AT FAVEROLLES
HIS MOTHER WAS NAMED JEANNE MATHIEU HIS
FATHER WAS CALLED JEAN VALJEAN OR VLAJEAN PROBABLY A SOBRIQUET AND A
CONTRACTION OF VIOLA JEAN HERE'S JEAN
JEAN VALJEAN WAS OF THAT THOUGHTFUL BUT NOT GLOOMY DISPOSITION WHICH
CONSTITUTES THE PECULIARITY OF AFFECTIONATE NATURES
ON THE WHOLE
HOWEVER THERE WAS SOMETHING DECIDEDLY SLUGGISH AND INSIGNIFICANT ABOUT
JEAN VALJEAN IN APPEARANCE AT LEAST
HE HAD LOST HIS FATHER AND MOTHER
AT A VERY EARLY AGE
HIS MOTHER HAD DIED OF A MILK FEVER WHICH HAD NOT
BEEN PROPERLY ATTENDED TO
HIS FATHER A TREE PRUNER LIKE HIMSELF HAD
BEEN KILLED BY A FALL FROM A TREE
ALL THAT REMAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN
WAS A SISTER OLDER THAN HIMSELF A WIDOW WITH SEVEN CHILDREN BOYS AND
GIRLS
THIS SISTER HAD BROUGHT UP JEAN VALJEAN AND SO LONG AS SHE HAD A
HUSBAND SHE LODGED AND FED HER YOUNG BROTHER
THE HUSBAND DIED
THE ELDEST OF THE SEVEN CHILDREN WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD
THE YOUNGEST ONE
JEAN VALJEAN HAD JUST ATTAINED HIS TWENTY FIFTH YEAR
HE TOOK THE
FATHER'S PLACE AND IN HIS TURN SUPPORTED THE SISTER WHO HAD BROUGHT
HIM UP
THIS WAS DONE SIMPLY AS A DUTY AND EVEN A LITTLE CHURLISHLY
ON THE PART OF JEAN VALJEAN
THUS HIS YOUTH HAD BEEN SPENT IN RUDE AND
ILL PAID TOIL
HE HAD NEVER KNOWN A KIND WOMAN FRIEND IN HIS NATIVE
PARTS
HE HAD NOT HAD THE TIME TO FALL IN LOVE
HE RETURNED AT NIGHT WEARY AND ATE HIS BROTH WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD
HIS SISTER MOTHER JEANNE OFTEN TOOK THE BEST PART OF HIS REPAST FROM
HIS BOWL WHILE HE WAS EATING A BIT OF MEAT A SLICE OF BACON THE
HEART OF THE CABBAGE TO GIVE TO ONE OF HER CHILDREN
AS HE WENT ON
EATING WITH HIS HEAD BENT OVER THE TABLE AND ALMOST INTO HIS SOUP HIS
LONG HAIR FALLING ABOUT HIS BOWL AND CONCEALING HIS EYES HE HAD THE AIR
OF PERCEIVING NOTHING AND ALLOWING IT
THERE WAS AT FAVEROLLES NOT
FAR FROM THE VALJEAN THATCHED COTTAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LANE
A FARMER'S WIFE NAMED MARIE CLAUDE THE VALJEAN CHILDREN HABITUALLY
FAMISHED SOMETIMES WENT TO BORROW FROM MARIE CLAUDE A PINT OF MILK IN
THEIR MOTHER'S NAME WHICH THEY DRANK BEHIND A HEDGE OR IN SOME ALLEY
CORNER SNATCHING THE JUG FROM EACH OTHER SO HASTILY THAT THE LITTLE
GIRLS SPILLED IT ON THEIR APRONS AND DOWN THEIR NECKS
IF THEIR MOTHER
HAD KNOWN OF THIS MARAUDING SHE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE DELINQUENTS
SEVERELY
JEAN VALJEAN GRUFFLY AND GRUMBLINGLY PAID MARIE CLAUDE FOR
THE PINT OF MILK BEHIND THEIR MOTHER'S BACK AND THE CHILDREN WERE NOT
PUNISHED
IN PRUNING SEASON HE EARNED EIGHTEEN SOUS A DAY THEN HE HIRED OUT AS
A HAY MAKER AS LABORER AS NEAT HERD ON A FARM AS A DRUDGE
HE DID
WHATEVER HE COULD
HIS SISTER WORKED ALSO BUT WHAT COULD SHE DO WITH
SEVEN LITTLE CHILDREN IT WAS A SAD GROUP ENVELOPED IN MISERY WHICH WAS
BEING GRADUALLY ANNIHILATED
A VERY HARD WINTER CAME
JEAN HAD NO WORK
THE FAMILY HAD NO BREAD
NO BREAD LITERALLY
SEVEN CHILDREN
ONE SUNDAY EVENING MAUBERT ISABEAU THE BAKER ON THE CHURCH SQUARE AT
FAVEROLLES WAS PREPARING TO GO TO BED WHEN HE HEARD A VIOLENT BLOW ON
THE GRATED FRONT OF HIS SHOP
HE ARRIVED IN TIME TO SEE AN ARM PASSED
THROUGH A HOLE MADE BY A BLOW FROM A FIST THROUGH THE GRATING AND THE
GLASS
THE ARM SEIZED A LOAF OF BREAD AND CARRIED IT OFF
ISABEAU RAN
OUT IN HASTE THE ROBBER FLED AT THE FULL SPEED OF HIS LEGS
ISABEAU RAN
AFTER HIM AND STOPPED HIM
THE THIEF HAD FLUNG AWAY THE LOAF BUT HIS
ARM WAS STILL BLEEDING
IT WAS JEAN VALJEAN
THIS TOOK PLACE IN 1795
JEAN VALJEAN WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS
OF THE TIME FOR THEFT AND BREAKING AND ENTERING AN INHABITED HOUSE AT
NIGHT
HE HAD A GUN WHICH HE USED BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD
HE WAS A BIT OF A POACHER AND THIS INJURED HIS CASE
THERE EXISTS A
LEGITIMATE PREJUDICE AGAINST POACHERS
THE POACHER LIKE THE SMUGGLER
SMACKS TOO STRONGLY OF THE BRIGAND
NEVERTHELESS WE WILL REMARK
CURSORILY THERE IS STILL AN ABYSS BETWEEN THESE RACES OF MEN AND THE
HIDEOUS ASSASSIN OF THE TOWNS
THE POACHER LIVES IN THE FOREST THE
SMUGGLER LIVES IN THE MOUNTAINS OR ON THE SEA
THE CITIES MAKE FEROCIOUS
MEN BECAUSE THEY MAKE CORRUPT MEN
THE MOUNTAIN THE SEA THE FOREST
MAKE SAVAGE MEN THEY DEVELOP THE FIERCE SIDE BUT OFTEN WITHOUT
DESTROYING THE HUMANE SIDE
JEAN VALJEAN WAS PRONOUNCED GUILTY
THE TERMS OF THE CODE WERE EXPLICIT
THERE OCCUR FORMIDABLE HOURS IN OUR CIVILIZATION THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN
THE PENAL LAWS DECREE A SHIPWRECK
WHAT AN OMINOUS MINUTE IS THAT IN
WHICH SOCIETY DRAWS BACK AND CONSUMMATES THE IRREPARABLE ABANDONMENT
OF A SENTIENT BEING JEAN VALJEAN WAS CONDEMNED TO FIVE YEARS IN THE
GALLEYS
ON THE 22D OF APRIL 1796 THE VICTORY OF MONTENOTTE WON BY THE
GENERAL IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY OF ITALY WHOM THE MESSAGE OF THE DIRECTORY
TO THE FIVE HUNDRED OF THE 2D OF FLOREAL YEAR IV CALLS BUONA PARTE
WAS ANNOUNCED IN PARIS ON THAT SAME DAY A GREAT GANG OF GALLEY SLAVES
WAS PUT IN CHAINS AT BICETRE
JEAN VALJEAN FORMED A PART OF THAT GANG
AN OLD TURNKEY OF THE PRISON WHO IS NOW NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS OLD STILL
RECALLS PERFECTLY THAT UNFORTUNATE WRETCH WHO WAS CHAINED TO THE END OF
THE FOURTH LINE IN THE NORTH ANGLE OF THE COURTYARD
HE WAS SEATED ON
THE GROUND LIKE THE OTHERS
HE DID NOT SEEM TO COMPREHEND HIS POSITION
EXCEPT THAT IT WAS HORRIBLE
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE ALSO WAS
DISENTANGLING FROM AMID THE VAGUE IDEAS OF A POOR MAN IGNORANT OF
EVERYTHING SOMETHING EXCESSIVE
WHILE THE BOLT OF HIS IRON COLLAR WAS
BEING RIVETED BEHIND HIS HEAD WITH HEAVY BLOWS FROM THE HAMMER HE WEPT
HIS TEARS STIFLED HIM THEY IMPEDED HIS SPEECH HE ONLY MANAGED TO
SAY FROM TIME TO TIME I WAS A TREE PRUNER AT FAVEROLLES THEN STILL
SOBBING HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND AND LOWERED IT GRADUALLY SEVEN TIMES
AS THOUGH HE WERE TOUCHING IN SUCCESSION SEVEN HEADS OF UNEQUAL HEIGHTS
AND FROM THIS GESTURE IT WAS DIVINED THAT THE THING WHICH HE HAD DONE
WHATEVER IT WAS HE HAD DONE FOR THE SAKE OF CLOTHING AND NOURISHING
SEVEN LITTLE CHILDREN
HE SET OUT FOR TOULON
HE ARRIVED THERE AFTER A JOURNEY OF TWENTY SEVEN
DAYS ON A CART WITH A CHAIN ON HIS NECK
AT TOULON HE WAS CLOTHED IN
THE RED CASSOCK
ALL THAT HAD CONSTITUTED HIS LIFE EVEN TO HIS NAME
WAS EFFACED HE WAS NO LONGER EVEN JEAN VALJEAN HE WAS NUMBER 24 601
WHAT BECAME OF HIS SISTER WHAT BECAME OF THE SEVEN CHILDREN WHO
TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT THAT WHAT BECOMES OF THE HANDFUL OF LEAVES FROM
THE YOUNG TREE WHICH IS SAWED OFF AT THE ROOT
IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME STORY
THESE POOR LIVING BEINGS THESE CREATURES
OF GOD HENCEFORTH WITHOUT SUPPORT WITHOUT GUIDE WITHOUT REFUGE
WANDERED AWAY AT RANDOM WHO EVEN KNOWS EACH IN HIS OWN DIRECTION
PERHAPS AND LITTLE BY LITTLE BURIED THEMSELVES IN THAT COLD MIST WHICH
ENGULFS SOLITARY DESTINIES GLOOMY SHADES INTO WHICH DISAPPEAR IN
SUCCESSION SO MANY UNLUCKY HEADS IN THE SOMBRE MARCH OF THE HUMAN RACE
THEY QUITTED THE COUNTRY
THE CLOCK TOWER OF WHAT HAD BEEN THEIR VILLAGE
FORGOT THEM THE BOUNDARY LINE OF WHAT HAD BEEN THEIR FIELD FORGOT THEM
AFTER A FEW YEARS' RESIDENCE IN THE GALLEYS JEAN VALJEAN HIMSELF FORGOT
THEM
IN THAT HEART WHERE THERE HAD BEEN A WOUND THERE WAS A SCAR
THAT IS ALL
ONLY ONCE DURING ALL THE TIME WHICH HE SPENT AT TOULON
DID HE HEAR HIS SISTER MENTIONED
THIS HAPPENED I THINK TOWARDS
THE END OF THE FOURTH YEAR OF HIS CAPTIVITY
I KNOW NOT THROUGH WHAT
CHANNELS THE NEWS REACHED HIM
SOME ONE WHO HAD KNOWN THEM IN THEIR
OWN COUNTRY HAD SEEN HIS SISTER
SHE WAS IN PARIS
SHE LIVED IN A POOR
STREET REAR SAINT SULPICE IN THE RUE DU GINDRE
SHE HAD WITH HER ONLY
ONE CHILD A LITTLE BOY THE YOUNGEST
WHERE WERE THE OTHER SIX PERHAPS
SHE DID NOT KNOW HERSELF
EVERY MORNING SHE WENT TO A PRINTING OFFICE
NO
3 RUE DU SABOT WHERE SHE WAS A FOLDER AND STITCHER
SHE WAS OBLIGED
TO BE THERE AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING LONG BEFORE DAYLIGHT IN
WINTER
IN THE SAME BUILDING WITH THE PRINTING OFFICE THERE WAS A
SCHOOL AND TO THIS SCHOOL SHE TOOK HER LITTLE BOY WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS
OLD
BUT AS SHE ENTERED THE PRINTING OFFICE AT SIX AND THE SCHOOL ONLY
OPENED AT SEVEN THE CHILD HAD TO WAIT IN THE COURTYARD FOR THE SCHOOL
TO OPEN FOR AN HOUR ONE HOUR OF A WINTER NIGHT IN THE OPEN AIR THEY
WOULD NOT ALLOW THE CHILD TO COME INTO THE PRINTING OFFICE BECAUSE HE
WAS IN THE WAY THEY SAID
WHEN THE WORKMEN PASSED IN THE MORNING THEY
BEHELD THIS POOR LITTLE BEING SEATED ON THE PAVEMENT OVERCOME WITH
DROWSINESS AND OFTEN FAST ASLEEP IN THE SHADOW CROUCHED DOWN AND
DOUBLED UP OVER HIS BASKET
WHEN IT RAINED AN OLD WOMAN THE PORTRESS
TOOK PITY ON HIM SHE TOOK HIM INTO HER DEN WHERE THERE WAS A PALLET A
SPINNING WHEEL AND TWO WOODEN CHAIRS AND THE LITTLE ONE SLUMBERED IN A
CORNER PRESSING HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE CAT THAT HE MIGHT SUFFER LESS FROM
COLD
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE SCHOOL OPENED AND HE ENTERED
THAT IS WHAT
WAS TOLD TO JEAN VALJEAN
THEY TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT FOR ONE DAY IT WAS A MOMENT A FLASH
AS THOUGH A WINDOW HAD SUDDENLY BEEN OPENED UPON THE DESTINY OF THOSE
THINGS WHOM HE HAD LOVED THEN ALL CLOSED AGAIN
HE HEARD NOTHING MORE
FOREVER
NOTHING FROM THEM EVER REACHED HIM AGAIN HE NEVER BEHELD
THEM HE NEVER MET THEM AGAIN AND IN THE CONTINUATION OF THIS MOURNFUL
HISTORY THEY WILL NOT BE MET WITH ANY MORE
TOWARDS THE END OF THIS FOURTH YEAR JEAN VALJEAN'S TURN TO ESCAPE
ARRIVED
HIS COMRADES ASSISTED HIM AS IS THE CUSTOM IN THAT SAD PLACE
HE ESCAPED
HE WANDERED FOR TWO DAYS IN THE FIELDS AT LIBERTY IF BEING
AT LIBERTY IS TO BE HUNTED TO TURN THE HEAD EVERY INSTANT TO QUAKE AT
THE SLIGHTEST NOISE TO BE AFRAID OF EVERYTHING OF A SMOKING ROOF
OF A PASSING MAN OF A BARKING DOG OF A GALLOPING HORSE OF A STRIKING
CLOCK OF THE DAY BECAUSE ONE CAN SEE OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE ONE CANNOT
SEE OF THE HIGHWAY OF THE PATH OF A BUSH OF SLEEP
ON THE EVENING
OF THE SECOND DAY HE WAS CAPTURED
HE HAD NEITHER EATEN NOR SLEPT FOR
THIRTY SIX HOURS
THE MARITIME TRIBUNAL CONDEMNED HIM FOR THIS CRIME
TO A PROLONGATION OF HIS TERM FOR THREE YEARS WHICH MADE EIGHT YEARS
IN THE SIXTH YEAR HIS TURN TO ESCAPE OCCURRED AGAIN HE AVAILED HIMSELF
OF IT BUT COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH HIS FLIGHT FULLY
HE WAS MISSING AT
ROLL CALL
THE CANNON WERE FIRED AND AT NIGHT THE PATROL FOUND HIM
HIDDEN UNDER THE KEEL OF A VESSEL IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION HE
RESISTED THE GALLEY GUARDS WHO SEIZED HIM
ESCAPE AND REBELLION
THIS
CASE PROVIDED FOR BY A SPECIAL CODE WAS PUNISHED BY AN ADDITION OF
FIVE YEARS TWO OF THEM IN THE DOUBLE CHAIN
THIRTEEN YEARS
IN THE
TENTH YEAR HIS TURN CAME ROUND AGAIN HE AGAIN PROFITED BY IT HE
SUCCEEDED NO BETTER
THREE YEARS FOR THIS FRESH ATTEMPT
SIXTEEN YEARS
FINALLY I THINK IT WAS DURING HIS THIRTEENTH YEAR HE MADE A LAST
ATTEMPT AND ONLY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RETAKEN AT THE END OF FOUR
HOURS OF ABSENCE
THREE YEARS FOR THOSE FOUR HOURS
NINETEEN YEARS
IN
OCTOBER 1815 HE WAS RELEASED HE HAD ENTERED THERE IN 1796 FOR HAVING
BROKEN A PANE OF GLASS AND TAKEN A LOAF OF BREAD
ROOM FOR A BRIEF PARENTHESIS
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME DURING HIS
STUDIES ON THE PENAL QUESTION AND DAMNATION BY LAW THAT THE AUTHOR OF
THIS BOOK HAS COME ACROSS THE THEFT OF A LOAF OF BREAD AS THE POINT OF
DEPARTURE FOR THE DISASTER OF A DESTINY
CLAUDE GUEUX HAD STOLEN A LOAF
JEAN VALJEAN HAD STOLEN A LOAF
ENGLISH STATISTICS PROVE THE FACT THAT
FOUR THEFTS OUT OF FIVE IN LONDON HAVE HUNGER FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE CAUSE
JEAN VALJEAN HAD ENTERED THE GALLEYS SOBBING AND SHUDDERING HE EMERGED
IMPASSIVE
HE HAD ENTERED IN DESPAIR HE EMERGED GLOOMY
WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THAT SOUL
CHAPTER VII THE INTERIOR OF DESPAIR
LET US TRY TO SAY IT
IT IS NECESSARY THAT SOCIETY SHOULD LOOK AT THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT IS
ITSELF WHICH CREATES THEM
HE WAS AS WE HAVE SAID AN IGNORANT MAN BUT HE WAS NOT A FOOL
THE
LIGHT OF NATURE WAS IGNITED IN HIM
UNHAPPINESS WHICH ALSO POSSESSES A
CLEARNESS OF VISION OF ITS OWN AUGMENTED THE SMALL AMOUNT OF DAYLIGHT
WHICH EXISTED IN THIS MIND
BENEATH THE CUDGEL BENEATH THE CHAIN IN
THE CELL IN HARDSHIP BENEATH THE BURNING SUN OF THE GALLEYS UPON THE
PLANK BED OF THE CONVICT HE WITHDREW INTO HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS AND
MEDITATED
HE CONSTITUTED HIMSELF THE TRIBUNAL
HE BEGAN BY PUTTING HIMSELF ON TRIAL
HE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT HE WAS NOT AN INNOCENT MAN UNJUSTLY
PUNISHED
HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD COMMITTED AN EXTREME AND BLAMEWORTHY
ACT THAT THAT LOAF OF BREAD WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE BEEN REFUSED TO
HIM HAD HE ASKED FOR IT THAT IN ANY CASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO
WAIT UNTIL HE COULD GET IT THROUGH COMPASSION OR THROUGH WORK THAT
IT IS NOT AN UNANSWERABLE ARGUMENT TO SAY CAN ONE WAIT WHEN ONE IS
HUNGRY THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS VERY RARE FOR ANY ONE TO DIE OF
HUNGER LITERALLY AND NEXT THAT FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY MAN
IS SO CONSTITUTED THAT HE CAN SUFFER LONG AND MUCH BOTH MORALLY AND
PHYSICALLY WITHOUT DYING THAT IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO HAVE
PATIENCE THAT THAT WOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THOSE POOR LITTLE
CHILDREN THAT IT HAD BEEN AN ACT OF MADNESS FOR HIM A MISERABLE
UNFORTUNATE WRETCH TO TAKE SOCIETY AT LARGE VIOLENTLY BY THE COLLAR
AND TO IMAGINE THAT ONE CAN ESCAPE FROM MISERY THROUGH THEFT THAT THAT
IS IN ANY CASE A POOR DOOR THROUGH WHICH TO ESCAPE FROM MISERY THROUGH
WHICH INFAMY ENTERS IN SHORT THAT HE WAS IN THE WRONG
THEN HE ASKED HIMSELF
WHETHER HE HAD BEEN THE ONLY ONE IN FAULT IN HIS FATAL HISTORY
WHETHER
IT WAS NOT A SERIOUS THING THAT HE A LABORER OUT OF WORK THAT HE AN
INDUSTRIOUS MAN SHOULD HAVE LACKED BREAD
AND WHETHER THE FAULT ONCE
COMMITTED AND CONFESSED THE CHASTISEMENT HAD NOT BEEN FEROCIOUS AND
DISPROPORTIONED
WHETHER THERE HAD NOT BEEN MORE ABUSE ON THE PART OF
THE LAW IN RESPECT TO THE PENALTY THAN THERE HAD BEEN ON THE PART
OF THE CULPRIT IN RESPECT TO HIS FAULT
WHETHER THERE HAD NOT BEEN AN
EXCESS OF WEIGHTS IN ONE BALANCE OF THE SCALE IN THE ONE WHICH CONTAINS
EXPIATION
WHETHER THE OVER WEIGHT OF THE PENALTY WAS NOT EQUIVALENT
TO THE ANNIHILATION OF THE CRIME AND DID NOT RESULT IN REVERSING THE
SITUATION OF REPLACING THE FAULT OF THE DELINQUENT BY THE FAULT OF THE
REPRESSION OF CONVERTING THE GUILTY MAN INTO THE VICTIM AND THE DEBTOR
INTO THE CREDITOR AND OF RANGING THE LAW DEFINITELY ON THE SIDE OF THE
MAN WHO HAD VIOLATED IT
WHETHER THIS PENALTY COMPLICATED BY SUCCESSIVE AGGRAVATIONS FOR
ATTEMPTS AT ESCAPE HAD NOT ENDED IN BECOMING A SORT OF OUTRAGE
PERPETRATED BY THE STRONGER UPON THE FEEBLER A CRIME OF SOCIETY AGAINST
THE INDIVIDUAL A CRIME WHICH WAS BEING COMMITTED AFRESH EVERY DAY A
CRIME WHICH HAD LASTED NINETEEN YEARS
HE ASKED HIMSELF WHETHER HUMAN SOCIETY COULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORCE ITS
MEMBERS TO SUFFER EQUALLY IN ONE CASE FOR ITS OWN UNREASONABLE LACK
OF FORESIGHT AND IN THE OTHER CASE FOR ITS PITILESS FORESIGHT AND TO
SEIZE A POOR MAN FOREVER BETWEEN A DEFECT AND AN EXCESS A DEFAULT OF
WORK AND AN EXCESS OF PUNISHMENT
WHETHER IT WAS NOT OUTRAGEOUS FOR SOCIETY TO TREAT THUS PRECISELY THOSE
OF ITS MEMBERS WHO WERE THE LEAST WELL ENDOWED IN THE DIVISION OF GOODS
MADE BY CHANCE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE MOST DESERVING OF CONSIDERATION
THESE QUESTIONS PUT AND ANSWERED HE JUDGED SOCIETY AND CONDEMNED IT
HE CONDEMNED IT TO HIS HATRED
HE MADE IT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FATE WHICH HE WAS SUFFERING AND HE SAID
TO HIMSELF THAT IT MIGHT BE THAT ONE DAY HE SHOULD NOT HESITATE TO CALL
IT TO ACCOUNT
HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS NO EQUILIBRIUM
BETWEEN THE HARM WHICH HE HAD CAUSED AND THE HARM WHICH WAS BEING DONE
TO HIM HE FINALLY ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS PUNISHMENT WAS
NOT IN TRUTH UNJUST BUT THAT IT MOST ASSUREDLY WAS INIQUITOUS
ANGER MAY BE BOTH FOOLISH AND ABSURD ONE CAN BE IRRITATED WRONGFULLY
ONE IS EXASPERATED ONLY WHEN THERE IS SOME SHOW OF RIGHT ON ONE'S SIDE
AT BOTTOM
JEAN VALJEAN FELT HIMSELF EXASPERATED
AND BESIDES HUMAN SOCIETY HAD DONE HIM NOTHING BUT HARM HE HAD NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING OF IT SAVE THAT ANGRY FACE WHICH IT CALLS JUSTICE AND
WHICH IT SHOWS TO THOSE WHOM IT STRIKES
MEN HAD ONLY TOUCHED HIM TO
BRUISE HIM
EVERY CONTACT WITH THEM HAD BEEN A BLOW
NEVER SINCE
HIS INFANCY SINCE THE DAYS OF HIS MOTHER OF HIS SISTER HAD HE EVER
ENCOUNTERED A FRIENDLY WORD AND A KINDLY GLANCE
FROM SUFFERING TO
SUFFERING HE HAD GRADUALLY ARRIVED AT THE CONVICTION THAT LIFE IS A
WAR AND THAT IN THIS WAR HE WAS THE CONQUERED
HE HAD NO OTHER WEAPON
THAN HIS HATE
HE RESOLVED TO WHET IT IN THE GALLEYS AND TO BEAR IT AWAY
WITH HIM WHEN HE DEPARTED
THERE WAS AT TOULON A SCHOOL FOR THE CONVICTS KEPT BY THE IGNORANTIN
FRIARS WHERE THE MOST NECESSARY BRANCHES WERE TAUGHT TO THOSE OF THE
UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO HAD A MIND FOR THEM
HE WAS OF THE NUMBER WHO HAD
A MIND
HE WENT TO SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF FORTY AND LEARNED TO READ
TO WRITE TO CIPHER
HE FELT THAT TO FORTIFY HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS TO
FORTIFY HIS HATE
IN CERTAIN CASES EDUCATION AND ENLIGHTENMENT CAN
SERVE TO EKE OUT EVIL
THIS IS A SAD THING TO SAY AFTER HAVING JUDGED SOCIETY WHICH HAD
CAUSED HIS UNHAPPINESS HE JUDGED PROVIDENCE WHICH HAD MADE SOCIETY
AND HE CONDEMNED IT ALSO
THUS DURING NINETEEN YEARS OF TORTURE AND SLAVERY THIS SOUL MOUNTED AND
AT THE SAME TIME FELL
LIGHT ENTERED IT ON ONE SIDE AND DARKNESS ON THE
OTHER
JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT AS WE HAVE SEEN AN EVIL NATURE
HE WAS STILL GOOD
WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE GALLEYS
HE THERE CONDEMNED SOCIETY AND FELT
THAT HE WAS BECOMING WICKED HE THERE CONDEMNED PROVIDENCE AND WAS
CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS BECOMING IMPIOUS
IT IS DIFFICULT NOT TO INDULGE IN MEDITATION AT THIS POINT
DOES HUMAN NATURE THUS CHANGE UTTERLY AND FROM TOP TO BOTTOM CAN THE
MAN CREATED GOOD BY GOD BE RENDERED WICKED BY MAN CAN THE SOUL BE
COMPLETELY MADE OVER BY FATE AND BECOME EVIL FATE BEING EVIL CAN
THE HEART BECOME MISSHAPEN AND CONTRACT INCURABLE DEFORMITIES AND
INFIRMITIES UNDER THE OPPRESSION OF A DISPROPORTIONATE UNHAPPINESS
AS THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN BENEATH TOO LOW A VAULT IS THERE NOT IN EVERY
HUMAN SOUL WAS THERE NOT IN THE SOUL OF JEAN VALJEAN IN PARTICULAR A
FIRST SPARK A DIVINE ELEMENT INCORRUPTIBLE IN THIS WORLD IMMORTAL IN
THE OTHER WHICH GOOD CAN DEVELOP FAN IGNITE AND MAKE TO GLOW WITH
SPLENDOR AND WHICH EVIL CAN NEVER WHOLLY EXTINGUISH
GRAVE AND OBSCURE QUESTIONS TO THE LAST OF WHICH EVERY PHYSIOLOGIST
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE RESPONDED NO AND THAT WITHOUT HESITATION HAD
HE BEHELD AT TOULON DURING THE HOURS OF REPOSE WHICH WERE FOR JEAN
VALJEAN HOURS OF REVERY THIS GLOOMY GALLEY SLAVE SEATED WITH FOLDED
ARMS UPON THE BAR OF SOME CAPSTAN WITH THE END OF HIS CHAIN THRUST INTO
HIS POCKET TO PREVENT ITS DRAGGING SERIOUS SILENT AND THOUGHTFUL
A PARIAH OF THE LAWS WHICH REGARDED THE MAN WITH WRATH CONDEMNED BY
CIVILIZATION AND REGARDING HEAVEN WITH SEVERITY
CERTAINLY AND WE MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO DISSIMULATE THE FACT THE
OBSERVING PHYSIOLOGIST WOULD HAVE BEHELD AN IRREMEDIABLE MISERY HE
WOULD PERCHANCE HAVE PITIED THIS SICK MAN OF THE LAW'S MAKING BUT
HE WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN ESSAYED ANY TREATMENT HE WOULD HAVE TURNED ASIDE
HIS GAZE FROM THE CAVERNS OF WHICH HE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE WITHIN
THIS SOUL AND LIKE DANTE AT THE PORTALS OF HELL HE WOULD HAVE EFFACED
FROM THIS EXISTENCE THE WORD WHICH THE FINGER OF GOD HAS NEVERTHELESS
INSCRIBED UPON THE BROW OF EVERY MAN HOPE
WAS THIS STATE OF HIS SOUL WHICH WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ANALYZE AS
PERFECTLY CLEAR TO JEAN VALJEAN AS WE HAVE TRIED TO RENDER IT FOR
THOSE WHO READ US DID JEAN VALJEAN DISTINCTLY PERCEIVE AFTER THEIR
FORMATION AND HAD HE SEEN DISTINCTLY DURING THE PROCESS OF THEIR
FORMATION ALL THE ELEMENTS OF WHICH HIS MORAL MISERY WAS COMPOSED HAD
THIS ROUGH AND UNLETTERED MAN GATHERED A PERFECTLY CLEAR PERCEPTION OF
THE SUCCESSION OF IDEAS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD BY DEGREES MOUNTED AND
DESCENDED TO THE LUGUBRIOUS ASPECTS WHICH HAD FOR SO MANY YEARS FORMED
THE INNER HORIZON OF HIS SPIRIT WAS HE CONSCIOUS OF ALL THAT PASSED
WITHIN HIM AND OF ALL THAT WAS WORKING THERE THAT IS SOMETHING
WHICH WE DO NOT PRESUME TO STATE IT IS SOMETHING WHICH WE DO NOT EVEN
BELIEVE
THERE WAS TOO MUCH IGNORANCE IN JEAN VALJEAN EVEN AFTER HIS
MISFORTUNE TO PREVENT MUCH VAGUENESS FROM STILL LINGERING THERE
AT
TIMES HE DID NOT RIGHTLY KNOW HIMSELF WHAT HE FELT
JEAN VALJEAN WAS IN
THE SHADOWS HE SUFFERED IN THE SHADOWS HE HATED IN THE SHADOWS ONE
MIGHT HAVE SAID THAT HE HATED IN ADVANCE OF HIMSELF
HE DWELT HABITUALLY
IN THIS SHADOW FEELING HIS WAY LIKE A BLIND MAN AND A DREAMER
ONLY AT
INTERVALS THERE SUDDENLY CAME TO HIM FROM WITHOUT AND FROM WITHIN AN
ACCESS OF WRATH A SURCHARGE OF SUFFERING A LIVID AND RAPID FLASH WHICH
ILLUMINATED HIS WHOLE SOUL AND CAUSED TO APPEAR ABRUPTLY ALL AROUND
HIM IN FRONT BEHIND AMID THE GLEAMS OF A FRIGHTFUL LIGHT THE HIDEOUS
PRECIPICES AND THE SOMBRE PERSPECTIVE OF HIS DESTINY
THE FLASH PASSED THE NIGHT CLOSED IN AGAIN AND WHERE WAS HE HE NO
LONGER KNEW
THE PECULIARITY OF PAINS OF THIS NATURE IN WHICH
THAT WHICH IS PITILESS THAT IS TO SAY THAT WHICH IS
BRUTALIZING PREDOMINATES IS TO TRANSFORM A MAN LITTLE BY LITTLE BY
A SORT OF STUPID TRANSFIGURATION INTO A WILD BEAST SOMETIMES INTO A
FEROCIOUS BEAST
JEAN VALJEAN'S SUCCESSIVE AND OBSTINATE ATTEMPTS AT ESCAPE WOULD ALONE
SUFFICE TO PROVE THIS STRANGE WORKING OF THE LAW UPON THE HUMAN SOUL
JEAN VALJEAN WOULD HAVE RENEWED THESE ATTEMPTS UTTERLY USELESS AND
FOOLISH AS THEY WERE AS OFTEN AS THE OPPORTUNITY HAD PRESENTED ITSELF
WITHOUT REFLECTING FOR AN INSTANT ON THE RESULT NOR ON THE EXPERIENCES
WHICH HE HAD ALREADY GONE THROUGH
HE ESCAPED IMPETUOUSLY LIKE THE WOLF
WHO FINDS HIS CAGE OPEN
INSTINCT SAID TO HIM FLEE REASON WOULD HAVE
SAID REMAIN BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF SO VIOLENT A TEMPTATION REASON
VANISHED NOTHING REMAINED BUT INSTINCT
THE BEAST ALONE ACTED
WHEN
HE WAS RECAPTURED THE FRESH SEVERITIES INFLICTED ON HIM ONLY SERVED TO
RENDER HIM STILL MORE WILD
ONE DETAIL WHICH WE MUST NOT OMIT IS THAT HE POSSESSED A PHYSICAL
STRENGTH WHICH WAS NOT APPROACHED BY A SINGLE ONE OF THE DENIZENS OF THE
GALLEYS
AT WORK AT PAYING OUT A CABLE OR WINDING UP A CAPSTAN JEAN
VALJEAN WAS WORTH FOUR MEN
HE SOMETIMES LIFTED AND SUSTAINED ENORMOUS
WEIGHTS ON HIS BACK AND WHEN THE OCCASION DEMANDED IT HE REPLACED THAT
IMPLEMENT WHICH IS CALLED A JACK SCREW AND WAS FORMERLY CALLED ORGUEIL
PRIDE WHENCE WE MAY REMARK IN PASSING IS DERIVED THE NAME OF THE
RUE MONTORGUEIL NEAR THE HALLES FISHMARKET IN PARIS
HIS COMRADES HAD
NICKNAMED HIM JEAN THE JACK SCREW
ONCE WHEN THEY WERE REPAIRING THE
BALCONY OF THE TOWN HALL AT TOULON ONE OF THOSE ADMIRABLE CARYATIDS OF
PUGET WHICH SUPPORT THE BALCONY BECAME LOOSENED AND WAS ON THE POINT
OF FALLING
JEAN VALJEAN WHO WAS PRESENT SUPPORTED THE CARYATID WITH
HIS SHOULDER AND GAVE THE WORKMEN TIME TO ARRIVE
HIS SUPPLENESS EVEN EXCEEDED HIS STRENGTH
CERTAIN CONVICTS WHO WERE
FOREVER DREAMING OF ESCAPE ENDED BY MAKING A VERITABLE SCIENCE OF FORCE
AND SKILL COMBINED
IT IS THE SCIENCE OF MUSCLES
AN ENTIRE SYSTEM OF
MYSTERIOUS STATICS IS DAILY PRACTISED BY PRISONERS MEN WHO ARE FOREVER
ENVIOUS OF THE FLIES AND BIRDS
TO CLIMB A VERTICAL SURFACE AND TO FIND
POINTS OF SUPPORT WHERE HARDLY A PROJECTION WAS VISIBLE WAS PLAY TO
JEAN VALJEAN
AN ANGLE OF THE WALL BEING GIVEN WITH THE TENSION OF HIS
BACK AND LEGS WITH HIS ELBOWS AND HIS HEELS FITTED INTO THE UNEVENNESS
OF THE STONE HE RAISED HIMSELF AS IF BY MAGIC TO THE THIRD STORY
HE
SOMETIMES MOUNTED THUS EVEN TO THE ROOF OF THE GALLEY PRISON
HE SPOKE BUT LITTLE
HE LAUGHED NOT AT ALL
AN EXCESSIVE EMOTION WAS
REQUIRED TO WRING FROM HIM ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR THAT LUGUBRIOUS LAUGH
OF THE CONVICT WHICH IS LIKE THE ECHO OF THE LAUGH OF A DEMON
TO ALL
APPEARANCE HE SEEMED TO BE OCCUPIED IN THE CONSTANT CONTEMPLATION OF
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HE WAS ABSORBED IN FACT
ATHWART THE UNHEALTHY PERCEPTIONS OF AN INCOMPLETE NATURE AND A CRUSHED
INTELLIGENCE HE WAS CONFUSEDLY CONSCIOUS THAT SOME MONSTROUS THING WAS
RESTING ON HIM
IN THAT OBSCURE AND WAN SHADOW WITHIN WHICH HE CRAWLED
EACH TIME THAT HE TURNED HIS NECK AND ESSAYED TO RAISE HIS GLANCE
HE PERCEIVED WITH TERROR MINGLED WITH RAGE A SORT OF FRIGHTFUL
ACCUMULATION OF THINGS COLLECTING AND MOUNTING ABOVE HIM BEYOND THE
RANGE OF HIS VISION LAWS PREJUDICES MEN AND DEEDS WHOSE OUTLINES
ESCAPED HIM WHOSE MASS TERRIFIED HIM AND WHICH WAS NOTHING ELSE THAN
THAT PRODIGIOUS PYRAMID WHICH WE CALL CIVILIZATION
HE DISTINGUISHED
HERE AND THERE IN THAT SWARMING AND FORMLESS MASS NOW NEAR HIM NOW
AFAR OFF AND ON INACCESSIBLE TABLE LANDS SOME GROUP SOME DETAIL
VIVIDLY ILLUMINATED HERE THE GALLEY SERGEANT AND HIS CUDGEL THERE THE
GENDARME AND HIS SWORD YONDER THE MITRED ARCHBISHOP AWAY AT THE TOP
LIKE A SORT OF SUN THE EMPEROR CROWNED AND DAZZLING
IT SEEMED TO HIM
THAT THESE DISTANT SPLENDORS FAR FROM DISSIPATING HIS NIGHT RENDERED
IT MORE FUNEREAL AND MORE BLACK
ALL THIS LAWS PREJUDICES DEEDS MEN
THINGS WENT AND CAME ABOVE HIM OVER HIS HEAD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
COMPLICATED AND MYSTERIOUS MOVEMENT WHICH GOD IMPARTS TO CIVILIZATION
WALKING OVER HIM AND CRUSHING HIM WITH I KNOW NOT WHAT PEACEFULNESS
IN ITS CRUELTY AND INEXORABILITY IN ITS INDIFFERENCE
SOULS WHICH HAVE
FALLEN TO THE BOTTOM OF ALL POSSIBLE MISFORTUNE UNHAPPY MEN LOST IN THE
LOWEST OF THOSE LIMBOS AT WHICH NO ONE ANY LONGER LOOKS THE REPROVED OF
THE LAW FEEL THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THIS HUMAN SOCIETY SO FORMIDABLE FOR
HIM WHO IS WITHOUT SO FRIGHTFUL FOR HIM WHO IS BENEATH RESTING UPON
THEIR HEADS
IN THIS SITUATION JEAN VALJEAN MEDITATED AND WHAT COULD BE THE NATURE
OF HIS MEDITATION
IF THE GRAIN OF MILLET BENEATH THE MILLSTONE HAD THOUGHTS IT WOULD
DOUBTLESS THINK THAT SAME THING WHICH JEAN VALJEAN THOUGHT
ALL THESE THINGS REALITIES FULL OF SPECTRES PHANTASMAGORIES FULL OF
REALITIES HAD EVENTUALLY CREATED FOR HIM A SORT OF INTERIOR STATE WHICH
IS ALMOST INDESCRIBABLE
AT TIMES AMID HIS CONVICT TOIL HE PAUSED
HE FELL TO THINKING
HIS
REASON AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME RIPER AND MORE TROUBLED THAN OF YORE
ROSE IN REVOLT
EVERYTHING WHICH HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SEEMED TO HIM
ABSURD EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDED HIM SEEMED TO HIM IMPOSSIBLE
HE SAID
TO HIMSELF IT IS A DREAM HE GAZED AT THE GALLEY SERGEANT STANDING A
FEW PACES FROM HIM THE GALLEY SERGEANT SEEMED A PHANTOM TO HIM
ALL OF
A SUDDEN THE PHANTOM DEALT HIM A BLOW WITH HIS CUDGEL
VISIBLE NATURE HARDLY EXISTED FOR HIM
IT WOULD ALMOST BE TRUE TO SAY
THAT THERE EXISTED FOR JEAN VALJEAN NEITHER SUN NOR FINE SUMMER DAYS
NOR RADIANT SKY NOR FRESH APRIL DAWNS
I KNOW NOT WHAT VENT HOLE
DAYLIGHT HABITUALLY ILLUMINED HIS SOUL
TO SUM UP IN CONCLUSION THAT WHICH CAN BE SUMMED UP AND TRANSLATED
INTO POSITIVE RESULTS IN ALL THAT WE HAVE JUST POINTED OUT WE WILL
CONFINE OURSELVES TO THE STATEMENT THAT IN THE COURSE OF NINETEEN
YEARS JEAN VALJEAN THE INOFFENSIVE TREE PRUNER OF FAVEROLLES THE
FORMIDABLE CONVICT OF TOULON HAD BECOME CAPABLE THANKS TO THE MANNER
IN WHICH THE GALLEYS HAD MOULDED HIM OF TWO SORTS OF EVIL ACTION
FIRSTLY OF EVIL ACTION WHICH WAS RAPID UNPREMEDITATED DASHING
ENTIRELY INSTINCTIVE IN THE NATURE OF REPRISALS FOR THE EVIL WHICH
HE HAD UNDERGONE SECONDLY OF EVIL ACTION WHICH WAS SERIOUS GRAVE
CONSCIOUSLY ARGUED OUT AND PREMEDITATED WITH THE FALSE IDEAS WHICH
SUCH A MISFORTUNE CAN FURNISH
HIS DELIBERATE DEEDS PASSED THROUGH
THREE SUCCESSIVE PHASES WHICH NATURES OF A CERTAIN STAMP CAN ALONE
TRAVERSE REASONING WILL PERSEVERANCE
HE HAD FOR MOVING CAUSES HIS
HABITUAL WRATH BITTERNESS OF SOUL A PROFOUND SENSE OF INDIGNITIES
SUFFERED THE REACTION EVEN AGAINST THE GOOD THE INNOCENT AND THE
JUST IF THERE ARE ANY SUCH
THE POINT OF DEPARTURE LIKE THE POINT
OF ARRIVAL FOR ALL HIS THOUGHTS WAS HATRED OF HUMAN LAW THAT HATRED
WHICH IF IT BE NOT ARRESTED IN ITS DEVELOPMENT BY SOME PROVIDENTIAL
INCIDENT BECOMES WITHIN A GIVEN TIME THE HATRED OF SOCIETY THEN
THE HATRED OF THE HUMAN RACE THEN THE HATRED OF CREATION AND WHICH
MANIFESTS ITSELF BY A VAGUE INCESSANT AND BRUTAL DESIRE TO DO HARM TO
SOME LIVING BEING NO MATTER WHOM
IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS
NOT WITHOUT REASON THAT JEAN VALJEAN'S PASSPORT DESCRIBED HIM AS A VERY
DANGEROUS MAN
FROM YEAR TO YEAR THIS SOUL HAD DRIED AWAY SLOWLY BUT WITH FATAL
SURENESS
WHEN THE HEART IS DRY THE EYE IS DRY
ON HIS DEPARTURE FROM
THE GALLEYS IT HAD BEEN NINETEEN YEARS SINCE HE HAD SHED A TEAR
CHAPTER VIII BILLOWS AND SHADOWS
A MAN OVERBOARD
WHAT MATTERS IT THE VESSEL DOES NOT HALT
THE WIND BLOWS
THAT SOMBRE
SHIP HAS A PATH WHICH IT IS FORCED TO PURSUE
IT PASSES ON
THE MAN DISAPPEARS THEN REAPPEARS HE PLUNGES HE RISES AGAIN TO THE
SURFACE HE CALLS HE STRETCHES OUT HIS ARMS HE IS NOT HEARD
THE
VESSEL TREMBLING UNDER THE HURRICANE IS WHOLLY ABSORBED IN ITS OWN
WORKINGS THE PASSENGERS AND SAILORS DO NOT EVEN SEE THE DROWNING MAN
HIS MISERABLE HEAD IS BUT A SPECK AMID THE IMMENSITY OF THE WAVES
HE
GIVES VENT TO DESPERATE CRIES FROM OUT OF THE DEPTHS
WHAT A SPECTRE IS
THAT RETREATING SAIL HE GAZES AND GAZES AT IT FRANTICALLY
IT RETREATS
IT GROWS DIM IT DIMINISHES IN SIZE
HE WAS THERE BUT JUST NOW HE WAS
ONE OF THE CREW HE WENT AND CAME ALONG THE DECK WITH THE REST HE HAD
HIS PART OF BREATH AND OF SUNLIGHT HE WAS A LIVING MAN
NOW WHAT HAS
TAKEN PLACE HE HAS SLIPPED HE HAS FALLEN ALL IS AT AN END
HE IS IN THE TREMENDOUS SEA
UNDER FOOT HE HAS NOTHING BUT WHAT FLEES
AND CRUMBLES
THE BILLOWS TORN AND LASHED BY THE WIND ENCOMPASS HIM
HIDEOUSLY THE TOSSINGS OF THE ABYSS BEAR HIM AWAY ALL THE TONGUES OF
WATER DASH OVER HIS HEAD A POPULACE OF WAVES SPITS UPON HIM CONFUSED
OPENINGS HALF DEVOUR HIM EVERY TIME THAT HE SINKS HE CATCHES GLIMPSES
OF PRECIPICES FILLED WITH NIGHT FRIGHTFUL AND UNKNOWN VEGETATIONS SEIZE
HIM KNOT ABOUT HIS FEET DRAW HIM TO THEM HE IS CONSCIOUS THAT HE IS
BECOMING AN ABYSS THAT HE FORMS PART OF THE FOAM THE WAVES TOSS HIM
FROM ONE TO ANOTHER HE DRINKS IN THE BITTERNESS THE COWARDLY OCEAN
ATTACKS HIM FURIOUSLY TO DROWN HIM THE ENORMITY PLAYS WITH HIS AGONY
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ALL THAT WATER WERE HATE
NEVERTHELESS HE STRUGGLES
HE TRIES TO DEFEND HIMSELF HE TRIES TO SUSTAIN HIMSELF HE MAKES
AN EFFORT HE SWIMS
HE HIS PETTY STRENGTH ALL EXHAUSTED INSTANTLY
COMBATS THE INEXHAUSTIBLE
WHERE THEN IS THE SHIP YONDER
BARELY VISIBLE IN THE PALE SHADOWS OF
THE HORIZON
THE WIND BLOWS IN GUSTS ALL THE FOAM OVERWHELMS HIM
HE RAISES HIS EYES
AND BEHOLDS ONLY THE LIVIDNESS OF THE CLOUDS
HE WITNESSES AMID HIS
DEATH PANGS THE IMMENSE MADNESS OF THE SEA
HE IS TORTURED BY THIS
MADNESS HE HEARS NOISES STRANGE TO MAN WHICH SEEM TO COME FROM BEYOND
THE LIMITS OF THE EARTH AND FROM ONE KNOWS NOT WHAT FRIGHTFUL REGION
BEYOND
THERE ARE BIRDS IN THE CLOUDS JUST AS THERE ARE ANGELS ABOVE HUMAN
DISTRESSES BUT WHAT CAN THEY DO FOR HIM THEY SING AND FLY AND FLOAT
AND HE HE RATTLES IN THE DEATH AGONY
HE FEELS HIMSELF BURIED IN THOSE TWO INFINITIES THE OCEAN AND THE SKY
AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME THE ONE IS A TOMB THE OTHER IS A SHROUD
NIGHT DESCENDS HE HAS BEEN SWIMMING FOR HOURS HIS STRENGTH IS
EXHAUSTED THAT SHIP THAT DISTANT THING IN WHICH THERE WERE MEN HAS
VANISHED HE IS ALONE IN THE FORMIDABLE TWILIGHT GULF HE SINKS HE
STIFFENS HIMSELF HE TWISTS HIMSELF HE FEELS UNDER HIM THE MONSTROUS
BILLOWS OF THE INVISIBLE HE SHOUTS
THERE ARE NO MORE MEN
WHERE IS GOD
HE SHOUTS
HELP HELP HE STILL SHOUTS ON
NOTHING ON THE HORIZON NOTHING IN HEAVEN
HE IMPLORES THE EXPANSE THE WAVES THE SEAWEED THE REEF THEY ARE
DEAF
HE BESEECHES THE TEMPEST THE IMPERTURBABLE TEMPEST OBEYS ONLY THE
INFINITE
AROUND HIM DARKNESS FOG SOLITUDE THE STORMY AND NONSENTIENT TUMULT
THE UNDEFINED CURLING OF THOSE WILD WATERS
IN HIM HORROR AND FATIGUE
BENEATH HIM THE DEPTHS
NOT A POINT OF SUPPORT
HE THINKS OF THE GLOOMY
ADVENTURES OF THE CORPSE IN THE LIMITLESS SHADOW
THE BOTTOMLESS COLD
PARALYZES HIM
HIS HANDS CONTRACT CONVULSIVELY THEY CLOSE AND GRASP
NOTHINGNESS
WINDS CLOUDS WHIRLWINDS GUSTS USELESS STARS WHAT IS
TO BE DONE THE DESPERATE MAN GIVES UP HE IS WEARY HE CHOOSES THE
ALTERNATIVE OF DEATH HE RESISTS NOT HE LETS HIMSELF GO HE ABANDONS
HIS GRIP AND THEN HE TOSSES FOREVERMORE IN THE LUGUBRIOUS DREARY DEPTHS
OF ENGULFMENT
OH IMPLACABLE MARCH OF HUMAN SOCIETIES OH LOSSES OF MEN AND OF
SOULS ON THE WAY OCEAN INTO WHICH FALLS ALL THAT THE LAW LETS SLIP
DISASTROUS ABSENCE OF HELP OH MORAL DEATH
THE SEA IS THE INEXORABLE SOCIAL NIGHT INTO WHICH THE PENAL LAWS FLING
THEIR CONDEMNED
THE SEA IS THE IMMENSITY OF WRETCHEDNESS
THE SOUL GOING DOWN STREAM IN THIS GULF MAY BECOME A CORPSE
WHO SHALL
RESUSCITATE IT
CHAPTER IX NEW TROUBLES
WHEN THE HOUR CAME FOR HIM TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE FROM THE GALLEYS WHEN
JEAN VALJEAN HEARD IN HIS EAR THE STRANGE WORDS THOU ART FREE THE
MOMENT SEEMED IMPROBABLE AND UNPRECEDENTED A RAY OF VIVID LIGHT A RAY
OF THE TRUE LIGHT OF THE LIVING SUDDENLY PENETRATED WITHIN HIM
BUT IT
WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THIS RAY PALED
JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN DAZZLED BY
THE IDEA OF LIBERTY
HE HAD BELIEVED IN A NEW LIFE
HE VERY SPEEDILY
PERCEIVED WHAT SORT OF LIBERTY IT IS TO WHICH A YELLOW PASSPORT IS
PROVIDED
AND THIS WAS ENCOMPASSED WITH MUCH BITTERNESS
HE HAD CALCULATED THAT
HIS EARNINGS DURING HIS SOJOURN IN THE GALLEYS OUGHT TO AMOUNT TO
A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE FRANCS
IT IS BUT JUST TO ADD THAT HE HAD
FORGOTTEN TO INCLUDE IN HIS CALCULATIONS THE FORCED REPOSE OF SUNDAYS
AND FESTIVAL DAYS DURING NINETEEN YEARS WHICH ENTAILED A DIMINUTION
OF ABOUT EIGHTY FRANCS
AT ALL EVENTS HIS HOARD HAD BEEN REDUCED BY
VARIOUS LOCAL LEVIES TO THE SUM OF ONE HUNDRED AND NINE FRANCS FIFTEEN
SOUS WHICH HAD BEEN COUNTED OUT TO HIM ON HIS DEPARTURE
HE HAD
UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF THIS AND HAD THOUGHT HIMSELF WRONGED
LET US SAY
THE WORD ROBBED
ON THE DAY FOLLOWING HIS LIBERATION HE SAW AT GRASSE IN FRONT OF
AN ORANGE FLOWER DISTILLERY SOME MEN ENGAGED IN UNLOADING BALES
HE
OFFERED HIS SERVICES
BUSINESS WAS PRESSING THEY WERE ACCEPTED
HE SET
TO WORK
HE WAS INTELLIGENT ROBUST ADROIT HE DID HIS BEST THE MASTER
SEEMED PLEASED
WHILE HE WAS AT WORK A GENDARME PASSED OBSERVED
HIM AND DEMANDED HIS PAPERS
IT WAS NECESSARY TO SHOW HIM THE YELLOW
PASSPORT
THAT DONE JEAN VALJEAN RESUMED HIS LABOR
A LITTLE WHILE
BEFORE HE HAD QUESTIONED ONE OF THE WORKMEN AS TO THE AMOUNT WHICH THEY
EARNED EACH DAY AT THIS OCCUPATION HE HAD BEEN TOLD THIRTY SOUS
WHEN
EVENING ARRIVED AS HE WAS FORCED TO SET OUT AGAIN ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
HE PRESENTED HIMSELF TO THE OWNER OF THE DISTILLERY AND REQUESTED TO BE
PAID
THE OWNER DID NOT UTTER A WORD BUT HANDED HIM TWENTY FIVE SOUS
HE
OBJECTED
HE WAS TOLD THAT IS ENOUGH FOR THEE HE PERSISTED
THE
MASTER LOOKED HIM STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES AND SAID TO HIM BEWARE OF
THE PRISON
THERE AGAIN HE CONSIDERED THAT HE HAD BEEN ROBBED
SOCIETY THE STATE BY DIMINISHING HIS HOARD HAD ROBBED HIM WHOLESALE
NOW IT WAS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS ROBBING HIM AT RETAIL
LIBERATION IS NOT DELIVERANCE
ONE GETS FREE FROM THE GALLEYS BUT NOT
FROM THE SENTENCE
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AT GRASSE
WE HAVE SEEN IN WHAT MANNER HE
WAS RECEIVED AT D
CHAPTER X THE MAN AROUSED
AS THE CATHEDRAL CLOCK STRUCK TWO IN THE MORNING JEAN VALJEAN AWOKE
WHAT WOKE HIM WAS THAT HIS BED WAS TOO GOOD
IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS
SINCE HE HAD SLEPT IN A BED AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT UNDRESSED THE
SENSATION WAS TOO NOVEL NOT TO DISTURB HIS SLUMBERS
HE HAD SLEPT MORE THAN FOUR HOURS
HIS FATIGUE HAD PASSED AWAY
HE WAS
ACCUSTOMED NOT TO DEVOTE MANY HOURS TO REPOSE
HE OPENED HIS EYES AND STARED INTO THE GLOOM WHICH SURROUNDED HIM THEN
HE CLOSED THEM AGAIN WITH THE INTENTION OF GOING TO SLEEP ONCE MORE
WHEN MANY VARIED SENSATIONS HAVE AGITATED THE DAY WHEN VARIOUS MATTERS
PREOCCUPY THE MIND ONE FALLS ASLEEP ONCE BUT NOT A SECOND TIME
SLEEP COMES MORE EASILY THAN IT RETURNS
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO JEAN
VALJEAN
HE COULD NOT GET TO SLEEP AGAIN AND HE FELL TO THINKING
HE WAS AT ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHEN THE THOUGHTS WHICH ONE HAS IN ONE'S
MIND ARE TROUBLED
THERE WAS A SORT OF DARK CONFUSION IN HIS BRAIN
HIS
MEMORIES OF THE OLDEN TIME AND OF THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT FLOATED THERE
PELL MELL AND MINGLED CONFUSEDLY LOSING THEIR PROPER FORMS BECOMING
DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE THEN SUDDENLY DISAPPEARING AS IN A MUDDY AND
PERTURBED POOL
MANY THOUGHTS OCCURRED TO HIM BUT THERE WAS ONE WHICH
KEPT CONSTANTLY PRESENTING ITSELF AFRESH AND WHICH DROVE AWAY ALL
OTHERS
WE WILL MENTION THIS THOUGHT AT ONCE HE HAD OBSERVED THE SIX
SETS OF SILVER FORKS AND SPOONS AND THE LADLE WHICH MADAME MAGLOIRE HAD
PLACED ON THE TABLE
THOSE SIX SETS OF SILVER HAUNTED HIM THEY WERE THERE A FEW PACES
DISTANT JUST AS HE WAS TRAVERSING THE ADJOINING ROOM TO REACH THE
ONE IN WHICH HE THEN WAS THE OLD SERVANT WOMAN HAD BEEN IN THE ACT
OF PLACING THEM IN A LITTLE CUPBOARD NEAR THE HEAD OF THE BED HE HAD
TAKEN CAREFUL NOTE OF THIS CUPBOARD ON THE RIGHT AS YOU ENTERED FROM
THE DINING ROOM THEY WERE SOLID AND OLD SILVER FROM THE LADLE ONE
COULD GET AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED FRANCS DOUBLE WHAT HE HAD EARNED IN
NINETEEN YEARS IT IS TRUE THAT HE WOULD HAVE EARNED MORE IF THE
ADMINISTRATION HAD NOT ROBBED HIM
HIS MIND WAVERED FOR A WHOLE HOUR IN FLUCTUATIONS WITH WHICH THERE WAS
CERTAINLY MINGLED SOME STRUGGLE
THREE O'CLOCK STRUCK
HE OPENED HIS
EYES AGAIN DREW HIMSELF UP ABRUPTLY INTO A SITTING POSTURE STRETCHED
OUT HIS ARM AND FELT OF HIS KNAPSACK WHICH HE HAD THROWN DOWN ON A
CORNER OF THE ALCOVE THEN HE HUNG HIS LEGS OVER THE EDGE OF THE BED
AND PLACED HIS FEET ON THE FLOOR AND THUS FOUND HIMSELF ALMOST WITHOUT
KNOWING IT SEATED ON HIS BED
HE REMAINED FOR A TIME THOUGHTFULLY IN THIS ATTITUDE WHICH WOULD HAVE
BEEN SUGGESTIVE OF SOMETHING SINISTER FOR ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN HIM
THUS IN THE DARK THE ONLY PERSON AWAKE IN THAT HOUSE WHERE ALL WERE
SLEEPING
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE STOOPED DOWN REMOVED HIS SHOES AND PLACED
THEM SOFTLY ON THE MAT BESIDE THE BED THEN HE RESUMED HIS THOUGHTFUL
ATTITUDE AND BECAME MOTIONLESS ONCE MORE
THROUGHOUT THIS HIDEOUS MEDITATION THE THOUGHTS WHICH WE HAVE ABOVE
INDICATED MOVED INCESSANTLY THROUGH HIS BRAIN ENTERED WITHDREW
RE ENTERED AND IN A MANNER OPPRESSED HIM AND THEN HE THOUGHT ALSO
WITHOUT KNOWING WHY AND WITH THE MECHANICAL PERSISTENCE OF REVERY OF
A CONVICT NAMED BREVET WHOM HE HAD KNOWN IN THE GALLEYS AND WHOSE
TROUSERS HAD BEEN UPHELD BY A SINGLE SUSPENDER OF KNITTED COTTON
THE
CHECKERED PATTERN OF THAT SUSPENDER RECURRED INCESSANTLY TO HIS MIND
HE REMAINED IN THIS SITUATION AND WOULD HAVE SO REMAINED INDEFINITELY
EVEN UNTIL DAYBREAK HAD NOT THE CLOCK STRUCK ONE THE HALF OR QUARTER
HOUR
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THAT STROKE SAID TO HIM COME ON
HE ROSE TO HIS FEET HESITATED STILL ANOTHER MOMENT AND LISTENED ALL
WAS QUIET IN THE HOUSE THEN HE WALKED STRAIGHT AHEAD WITH SHORT STEPS
TO THE WINDOW OF WHICH HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
THE NIGHT WAS NOT VERY
DARK THERE WAS A FULL MOON ACROSS WHICH COURSED LARGE CLOUDS DRIVEN BY
THE WIND
THIS CREATED OUTDOORS ALTERNATE SHADOW AND GLEAMS OF LIGHT
ECLIPSES THEN BRIGHT OPENINGS OF THE CLOUDS AND INDOORS A SORT OF
TWILIGHT
THIS TWILIGHT SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SEE HIS WAY
INTERMITTENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE CLOUDS RESEMBLED THE SORT OF LIVID LIGHT
WHICH FALLS THROUGH AN AIR HOLE IN A CELLAR BEFORE WHICH THE PASSERSBY
COME AND GO
ON ARRIVING AT THE WINDOW JEAN VALJEAN EXAMINED IT
IT HAD
NO GRATING IT OPENED IN THE GARDEN AND WAS FASTENED ACCORDING TO THE
FASHION OF THE COUNTRY ONLY BY A SMALL PIN
HE OPENED IT BUT AS A
RUSH OF COLD AND PIERCING AIR PENETRATED THE ROOM ABRUPTLY HE CLOSED
IT AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
HE SCRUTINIZED THE GARDEN WITH THAT ATTENTIVE GAZE
WHICH STUDIES RATHER THAN LOOKS
THE GARDEN WAS ENCLOSED BY A TOLERABLY
LOW WHITE WALL EASY TO CLIMB
FAR AWAY AT THE EXTREMITY HE PERCEIVED
TOPS OF TREES SPACED AT REGULAR INTERVALS WHICH INDICATED THAT THE
WALL SEPARATED THE GARDEN FROM AN AVENUE OR LANE PLANTED WITH TREES
HAVING TAKEN THIS SURVEY HE EXECUTED A MOVEMENT LIKE THAT OF A MAN WHO
HAS MADE UP HIS MIND STRODE TO HIS ALCOVE GRASPED HIS KNAPSACK OPENED
IT FUMBLED IN IT PULLED OUT OF IT SOMETHING WHICH HE PLACED ON THE
BED PUT HIS SHOES INTO ONE OF HIS POCKETS SHUT THE WHOLE THING UP
AGAIN THREW THE KNAPSACK ON HIS SHOULDERS PUT ON HIS CAP DREW THE
VISOR DOWN OVER HIS EYES FELT FOR HIS CUDGEL WENT AND PLACED IT IN THE
ANGLE OF THE WINDOW THEN RETURNED TO THE BED AND RESOLUTELY SEIZED THE
OBJECT WHICH HE HAD DEPOSITED THERE
IT RESEMBLED A SHORT BAR OF
IRON POINTED LIKE A PIKE AT ONE END
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO
DISTINGUISH IN THAT DARKNESS FOR WHAT EMPLOYMENT THAT BIT OF IRON COULD
HAVE BEEN DESIGNED
PERHAPS IT WAS A LEVER POSSIBLY IT WAS A CLUB
IN THE DAYTIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE IT AS NOTHING
MORE THAN A MINER'S CANDLESTICK
CONVICTS WERE AT THAT PERIOD
SOMETIMES EMPLOYED IN QUARRYING STONE FROM THE LOFTY HILLS WHICH ENVIRON
TOULON AND IT WAS NOT RARE FOR THEM TO HAVE MINERS' TOOLS AT THEIR
COMMAND
THESE MINERS' CANDLESTICKS ARE OF MASSIVE IRON TERMINATED AT
THE LOWER EXTREMITY BY A POINT BY MEANS OF WHICH THEY ARE STUCK INTO
THE ROCK
HE TOOK THE CANDLESTICK IN HIS RIGHT HAND HOLDING HIS BREATH AND TRYING
TO DEADEN THE SOUND OF HIS TREAD HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TO THE DOOR OF
THE ADJOINING ROOM OCCUPIED BY THE BISHOP AS WE ALREADY KNOW
ON ARRIVING AT THIS DOOR HE FOUND IT AJAR
THE BISHOP HAD NOT CLOSED
IT
CHAPTER XI WHAT HE DOES
JEAN VALJEAN LISTENED
NOT A SOUND
HE GAVE THE DOOR A PUSH
HE PUSHED IT GENTLY WITH THE TIP OF HIS FINGER LIGHTLY WITH THE
FURTIVE AND UNEASY GENTLENESS OF A CAT WHICH IS DESIROUS OF ENTERING
THE DOOR YIELDED TO THIS PRESSURE AND MADE AN IMPERCEPTIBLE AND SILENT
MOVEMENT WHICH ENLARGED THE OPENING A LITTLE
HE WAITED A MOMENT THEN GAVE THE DOOR A SECOND AND A BOLDER PUSH
IT CONTINUED TO YIELD IN SILENCE
THE OPENING WAS NOW LARGE ENOUGH TO
ALLOW HIM TO PASS
BUT NEAR THE DOOR THERE STOOD A LITTLE TABLE WHICH
FORMED AN EMBARRASSING ANGLE WITH IT AND BARRED THE ENTRANCE
JEAN VALJEAN RECOGNIZED THE DIFFICULTY
IT WAS NECESSARY AT ANY COST
TO ENLARGE THE APERTURE STILL FURTHER
HE DECIDED ON HIS COURSE OF ACTION AND GAVE THE DOOR A THIRD PUSH MORE
ENERGETIC THAN THE TWO PRECEDING
THIS TIME A BADLY OILED HINGE SUDDENLY
EMITTED AMID THE SILENCE A HOARSE AND PROLONGED CRY
JEAN VALJEAN SHUDDERED
THE NOISE OF THE HINGE RANG IN HIS EARS WITH
SOMETHING OF THE PIERCING AND FORMIDABLE SOUND OF THE TRUMP OF THE DAY
OF JUDGMENT
IN THE FANTASTIC EXAGGERATIONS OF THE FIRST MOMENT HE ALMOST IMAGINED
THAT THAT HINGE HAD JUST BECOME ANIMATED AND HAD SUDDENLY ASSUMED A
TERRIBLE LIFE AND THAT IT WAS BARKING LIKE A DOG TO AROUSE EVERY ONE
AND WARN AND TO WAKE THOSE WHO WERE ASLEEP
HE HALTED SHUDDERING
BEWILDERED AND FELL BACK FROM THE TIPS OF HIS TOES UPON HIS HEELS
HE
HEARD THE ARTERIES IN HIS TEMPLES BEATING LIKE TWO FORGE HAMMERS AND
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HIS BREATH ISSUED FROM HIS BREAST WITH THE ROAR
OF THE WIND ISSUING FROM A CAVERN
IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM THAT THE
HORRIBLE CLAMOR OF THAT IRRITATED HINGE SHOULD NOT HAVE DISTURBED THE
ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD LIKE THE SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE THE DOOR PUSHED BY
HIM HAD TAKEN THE ALARM AND HAD SHOUTED THE OLD MAN WOULD RISE AT
ONCE THE TWO OLD WOMEN WOULD SHRIEK OUT PEOPLE WOULD COME TO THEIR
ASSISTANCE IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE TOWN WOULD BE IN AN
UPROAR AND THE GENDARMERIE ON HAND
FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT HIMSELF
LOST
HE REMAINED WHERE HE WAS PETRIFIED LIKE THE STATUE OF SALT NOT DARING
TO MAKE A MOVEMENT
SEVERAL MINUTES ELAPSED
THE DOOR HAD FALLEN WIDE
OPEN
HE VENTURED TO PEEP INTO THE NEXT ROOM
NOTHING HAD STIRRED THERE
HE LENT AN EAR
NOTHING WAS MOVING IN THE HOUSE
THE NOISE MADE BY THE
RUSTY HINGE HAD NOT AWAKENED ANY ONE
THIS FIRST DANGER WAS PAST BUT THERE STILL REIGNED A FRIGHTFUL TUMULT
WITHIN HIM
NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT RETREAT
EVEN WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT
HIMSELF LOST HE HAD NOT DRAWN BACK
HIS ONLY THOUGHT NOW WAS TO FINISH
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
HE TOOK A STEP AND ENTERED THE ROOM
THIS ROOM WAS IN A STATE OF PERFECT CALM
HERE AND THERE VAGUE AND
CONFUSED FORMS WERE DISTINGUISHABLE WHICH IN THE DAYLIGHT WERE PAPERS
SCATTERED ON A TABLE OPEN FOLIOS VOLUMES PILED UPON A STOOL AN
ARM CHAIR HEAPED WITH CLOTHING A PRIE DIEU AND WHICH AT THAT HOUR
WERE ONLY SHADOWY CORNERS AND WHITISH SPOTS
JEAN VALJEAN ADVANCED WITH
PRECAUTION TAKING CARE NOT TO KNOCK AGAINST THE FURNITURE
HE COULD
HEAR AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE ROOM THE EVEN AND TRANQUIL BREATHING OF
THE SLEEPING BISHOP
HE SUDDENLY CAME TO A HALT
HE WAS NEAR THE BED
HE HAD ARRIVED THERE
SOONER THAN HE HAD THOUGHT FOR
NATURE SOMETIMES MINGLES HER EFFECTS AND HER SPECTACLES WITH OUR ACTIONS
WITH SOMBRE AND INTELLIGENT APPROPRIATENESS AS THOUGH SHE DESIRED TO
MAKE US REFLECT
FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR A LARGE CLOUD HAD COVERED THE
HEAVENS
AT THE MOMENT WHEN JEAN VALJEAN PAUSED IN FRONT OF THE BED
THIS CLOUD PARTED AS THOUGH ON PURPOSE AND A RAY OF LIGHT TRAVERSING
THE LONG WINDOW SUDDENLY ILLUMINATED THE BISHOP'S PALE FACE
HE WAS
SLEEPING PEACEFULLY
HE LAY IN HIS BED ALMOST COMPLETELY DRESSED ON
ACCOUNT OF THE COLD OF THE BASSES ALPS IN A GARMENT OF BROWN WOOL
WHICH COVERED HIS ARMS TO THE WRISTS
HIS HEAD WAS THROWN BACK ON THE
PILLOW IN THE CARELESS ATTITUDE OF REPOSE HIS HAND ADORNED WITH THE
PASTORAL RING AND WHENCE HAD FALLEN SO MANY GOOD DEEDS AND SO MANY
HOLY ACTIONS WAS HANGING OVER THE EDGE OF THE BED
HIS WHOLE FACE
WAS ILLUMINED WITH A VAGUE EXPRESSION OF SATISFACTION OF HOPE AND OF
FELICITY
IT WAS MORE THAN A SMILE AND ALMOST A RADIANCE
HE BORE UPON
HIS BROW THE INDESCRIBABLE REFLECTION OF A LIGHT WHICH WAS INVISIBLE
THE SOUL OF THE JUST CONTEMPLATES IN SLEEP A MYSTERIOUS HEAVEN
A REFLECTION OF THAT HEAVEN RESTED ON THE BISHOP
IT WAS AT THE SAME TIME A LUMINOUS TRANSPARENCY FOR THAT HEAVEN WAS
WITHIN HIM
THAT HEAVEN WAS HIS CONSCIENCE
ILLUSTRATION THE FALL 1B2 10 THE FALL
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE RAY OF MOONLIGHT SUPERPOSED ITSELF SO TO SPEAK
UPON THAT INWARD RADIANCE THE SLEEPING BISHOP SEEMED AS IN A GLORY
IT
REMAINED HOWEVER GENTLE AND VEILED IN AN INEFFABLE HALF LIGHT
THAT
MOON IN THE SKY THAT SLUMBERING NATURE THAT GARDEN WITHOUT A QUIVER
THAT HOUSE WHICH WAS SO CALM THE HOUR THE MOMENT THE SILENCE ADDED
SOME SOLEMN AND UNSPEAKABLE QUALITY TO THE VENERABLE REPOSE OF THIS MAN
AND ENVELOPED IN A SORT OF SERENE AND MAJESTIC AUREOLE THAT WHITE
HAIR THOSE CLOSED EYES THAT FACE IN WHICH ALL WAS HOPE AND ALL WAS
CONFIDENCE THAT HEAD OF AN OLD MAN AND THAT SLUMBER OF AN INFANT
THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST DIVINE IN THIS MAN WHO WAS THUS AUGUST
WITHOUT BEING HIMSELF AWARE OF IT
JEAN VALJEAN WAS IN THE SHADOW AND STOOD MOTIONLESS WITH HIS IRON
CANDLESTICK IN HIS HAND FRIGHTENED BY THIS LUMINOUS OLD MAN
NEVER HAD
HE BEHELD ANYTHING LIKE THIS
THIS CONFIDENCE TERRIFIED HIM
THE
MORAL WORLD HAS NO GRANDER SPECTACLE THAN THIS A TROUBLED AND
UNEASY CONSCIENCE WHICH HAS ARRIVED ON THE BRINK OF AN EVIL ACTION
CONTEMPLATING THE SLUMBER OF THE JUST
THAT SLUMBER IN THAT ISOLATION AND WITH A NEIGHBOR LIKE HIMSELF HAD
ABOUT IT SOMETHING SUBLIME OF WHICH HE WAS VAGUELY BUT IMPERIOUSLY
CONSCIOUS
NO ONE COULD HAVE TOLD WHAT WAS PASSING WITHIN HIM NOT EVEN HIMSELF
IN
ORDER TO ATTEMPT TO FORM AN IDEA OF IT IT IS NECESSARY TO THINK OF THE
MOST VIOLENT OF THINGS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST GENTLE
EVEN ON
HIS VISAGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH
CERTAINTY
IT WAS A SORT OF HAGGARD ASTONISHMENT
HE GAZED AT IT AND
THAT WAS ALL
BUT WHAT WAS HIS THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO
DIVINE IT
WHAT WAS EVIDENT WAS THAT HE WAS TOUCHED AND ASTOUNDED
BUT
WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THIS EMOTION
HIS EYE NEVER QUITTED THE OLD MAN
THE ONLY THING WHICH WAS CLEARLY
TO BE INFERRED FROM HIS ATTITUDE AND HIS PHYSIOGNOMY WAS A STRANGE
INDECISION
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS HESITATING BETWEEN THE TWO
ABYSSES THE ONE IN WHICH ONE LOSES ONE'S SELF AND THAT IN WHICH ONE
SAVES ONE'S SELF
HE SEEMED PREPARED TO CRUSH THAT SKULL OR TO KISS THAT
HAND
AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES HIS LEFT ARM ROSE SLOWLY TOWARDS
HIS BROW AND HE TOOK OFF HIS CAP THEN HIS ARM FELL BACK WITH THE SAME
DELIBERATION AND JEAN VALJEAN FELL TO MEDITATING ONCE MORE HIS CAP IN
HIS LEFT HAND HIS CLUB IN HIS RIGHT HAND HIS HAIR BRISTLING ALL OVER
HIS SAVAGE HEAD
THE BISHOP CONTINUED TO SLEEP IN PROFOUND PEACE BENEATH THAT TERRIFYING
GAZE
THE GLEAM OF THE MOON RENDERED CONFUSEDLY VISIBLE THE CRUCIFIX OVER THE
CHIMNEY PIECE WHICH SEEMED TO BE EXTENDING ITS ARMS TO BOTH OF THEM
WITH A BENEDICTION FOR ONE AND PARDON FOR THE OTHER
SUDDENLY JEAN VALJEAN REPLACED HIS CAP ON HIS BROW THEN STEPPED RAPIDLY
PAST THE BED WITHOUT GLANCING AT THE BISHOP STRAIGHT TO THE CUPBOARD
WHICH HE SAW NEAR THE HEAD HE RAISED HIS IRON CANDLESTICK AS THOUGH TO
FORCE THE LOCK THE KEY WAS THERE HE OPENED IT THE FIRST THING WHICH
PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM WAS THE BASKET OF SILVERWARE HE SEIZED IT
TRAVERSED THE CHAMBER WITH LONG STRIDES WITHOUT TAKING ANY PRECAUTIONS
AND WITHOUT TROUBLING HIMSELF ABOUT THE NOISE GAINED THE DOOR
RE ENTERED THE ORATORY OPENED THE WINDOW SEIZED HIS CUDGEL BESTRODE
THE WINDOW SILL OF THE GROUND FLOOR PUT THE SILVER INTO HIS KNAPSACK
THREW AWAY THE BASKET CROSSED THE GARDEN LEAPED OVER THE WALL LIKE A
TIGER AND FLED
CHAPTER XII THE BISHOP WORKS
THE NEXT MORNING AT SUNRISE MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU WAS STROLLING IN HIS
GARDEN
MADAME MAGLOIRE RAN UP TO HIM IN UTTER CONSTERNATION
MONSEIGNEUR MONSEIGNEUR SHE EXCLAIMED DOES YOUR GRACE KNOW WHERE
THE BASKET OF SILVER IS
YES REPLIED THE BISHOP
JESUS THE LORD BE BLESSED SHE RESUMED I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD
BECOME OF IT
THE BISHOP HAD JUST PICKED UP THE BASKET IN A FLOWER BED
HE PRESENTED
IT TO MADAME MAGLOIRE
HERE IT IS
WELL SAID SHE
NOTHING IN IT AND THE SILVER
AH RETURNED THE BISHOP SO IT IS THE SILVER WHICH TROUBLES YOU I
DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS
GREAT GOOD GOD IT IS STOLEN THAT MAN WHO WAS HERE LAST NIGHT HAS
STOLEN IT
IN A TWINKLING WITH ALL THE VIVACITY OF AN ALERT OLD WOMAN MADAME
MAGLOIRE HAD RUSHED TO THE ORATORY ENTERED THE ALCOVE AND RETURNED
TO THE BISHOP
THE BISHOP HAD JUST BENT DOWN AND WAS SIGHING AS HE
EXAMINED A PLANT OF COCHLEARIA DES GUILLONS WHICH THE BASKET HAD BROKEN
AS IT FELL ACROSS THE BED
HE ROSE UP AT MADAME MAGLOIRE'S CRY
MONSEIGNEUR THE MAN IS GONE THE SILVER HAS BEEN STOLEN
AS SHE UTTERED THIS EXCLAMATION HER EYES FELL UPON A CORNER OF THE
GARDEN WHERE TRACES OF THE WALL HAVING BEEN SCALED WERE VISIBLE
THE
COPING OF THE WALL HAD BEEN TORN AWAY
STAY YONDER IS THE WAY HE WENT
HE JUMPED OVER INTO COCHEFILET LANE
AH THE ABOMINATION HE HAS STOLEN OUR SILVER
THE BISHOP REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT THEN HE RAISED HIS GRAVE EYES
AND SAID GENTLY TO MADAME MAGLOIRE
AND IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS THAT SILVER OURS
MADAME MAGLOIRE WAS SPEECHLESS
ANOTHER SILENCE ENSUED THEN THE BISHOP
WENT ON
MADAME MAGLOIRE I HAVE FOR A LONG TIME DETAINED THAT SILVER
WRONGFULLY
IT BELONGED TO THE POOR
WHO WAS THAT MAN A POOR MAN
EVIDENTLY
ALAS JESUS RETURNED MADAME MAGLOIRE
IT IS NOT FOR MY SAKE NOR FOR
MADEMOISELLE'S
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO US
BUT IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF
MONSEIGNEUR
WHAT IS MONSEIGNEUR TO EAT WITH NOW
THE BISHOP GAZED AT HER WITH AN AIR OF AMAZEMENT
AH COME ARE THERE NO SUCH THINGS AS PEWTER FORKS AND SPOONS
MADAME MAGLOIRE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
PEWTER HAS AN ODOR
IRON FORKS AND SPOONS THEN
MADAME MAGLOIRE MADE AN EXPRESSIVE GRIMACE
IRON HAS A TASTE
VERY WELL SAID THE BISHOP WOODEN ONES THEN
A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE WAS BREAKFASTING AT THE VERY TABLE AT WHICH
JEAN VALJEAN HAD SAT ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
AS HE ATE HIS BREAKFAST
MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME REMARKED GAYLY TO HIS SISTER WHO SAID NOTHING AND
TO MADAME MAGLOIRE WHO WAS GRUMBLING UNDER HER BREATH THAT ONE REALLY
DOES NOT NEED EITHER FORK OR SPOON EVEN OF WOOD IN ORDER TO DIP A BIT
OF BREAD IN A CUP OF MILK
A PRETTY IDEA TRULY SAID MADAME MAGLOIRE TO HERSELF AS SHE WENT AND
CAME TO TAKE IN A MAN LIKE THAT AND TO LODGE HIM CLOSE TO ONE'S SELF
AND HOW FORTUNATE THAT HE DID NOTHING BUT STEAL AH MON DIEU IT MAKES
ONE SHUDDER TO THINK OF IT
AS THE BROTHER AND SISTER WERE ABOUT TO RISE FROM THE TABLE THERE CAME
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
COME IN SAID THE BISHOP
THE DOOR OPENED
A SINGULAR AND VIOLENT GROUP MADE ITS APPEARANCE ON THE
THRESHOLD
THREE MEN WERE HOLDING A FOURTH MAN BY THE COLLAR
THE THREE
MEN WERE GENDARMES THE OTHER WAS JEAN VALJEAN
A BRIGADIER OF GENDARMES WHO SEEMED TO BE IN COMMAND OF THE GROUP WAS
STANDING NEAR THE DOOR
HE ENTERED AND ADVANCED TO THE BISHOP MAKING A
MILITARY SALUTE
MONSEIGNEUR SAID HE
AT THIS WORD JEAN VALJEAN WHO WAS DEJECTED AND SEEMED OVERWHELMED
RAISED HIS HEAD WITH AN AIR OF STUPEFACTION
MONSEIGNEUR HE MURMURED
SO HE IS NOT THE CURE
SILENCE SAID THE GENDARME
HE IS MONSEIGNEUR THE BISHOP
IN THE MEANTIME MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU HAD ADVANCED AS QUICKLY AS HIS
GREAT AGE PERMITTED
AH HERE YOU ARE HE EXCLAIMED LOOKING AT JEAN VALJEAN
I AM GLAD TO
SEE YOU
WELL BUT HOW IS THIS I GAVE YOU THE CANDLESTICKS TOO WHICH
ARE OF SILVER LIKE THE REST AND FOR WHICH YOU CAN CERTAINLY GET TWO
HUNDRED FRANCS
WHY DID YOU NOT CARRY THEM AWAY WITH YOUR FORKS AND
SPOONS
JEAN VALJEAN OPENED HIS EYES WIDE AND STARED AT THE VENERABLE BISHOP
WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH NO HUMAN TONGUE CAN RENDER ANY ACCOUNT OF
MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE BRIGADIER OF GENDARMES SO WHAT THIS MAN SAID
IS TRUE THEN WE CAME ACROSS HIM
HE WAS WALKING LIKE A MAN WHO IS
RUNNING AWAY
WE STOPPED HIM TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER
HE HAD THIS
SILVER
AND HE TOLD YOU INTERPOSED THE BISHOP WITH A SMILE THAT IT HAD BEEN
GIVEN TO HIM BY A KIND OLD FELLOW OF A PRIEST WITH WHOM HE HAD PASSED
THE NIGHT I SEE HOW THE MATTER STANDS
AND YOU HAVE BROUGHT HIM BACK
HERE IT IS A MISTAKE
IN THAT CASE REPLIED THE BRIGADIER WE CAN LET HIM GO
CERTAINLY REPLIED THE BISHOP
THE GENDARMES RELEASED JEAN VALJEAN WHO RECOILED
IS IT TRUE THAT I AM TO BE RELEASED HE SAID IN AN ALMOST
INARTICULATE VOICE AND AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING IN HIS SLEEP
YES THOU ART RELEASED DOST THOU NOT UNDERSTAND SAID ONE OF THE
GENDARMES
MY FRIEND RESUMED THE BISHOP BEFORE YOU GO HERE ARE YOUR
CANDLESTICKS
TAKE THEM
HE STEPPED TO THE CHIMNEY PIECE TOOK THE TWO SILVER CANDLESTICKS AND
BROUGHT THEM TO JEAN VALJEAN
THE TWO WOMEN LOOKED ON WITHOUT UTTERING
A WORD WITHOUT A GESTURE WITHOUT A LOOK WHICH COULD DISCONCERT THE
BISHOP
JEAN VALJEAN WAS TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB
HE TOOK THE TWO CANDLESTICKS
MECHANICALLY AND WITH A BEWILDERED AIR
NOW SAID THE BISHOP GO IN PEACE
BY THE WAY WHEN YOU RETURN MY
FRIEND IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO PASS THROUGH THE GARDEN
YOU CAN ALWAYS
ENTER AND DEPART THROUGH THE STREET DOOR
IT IS NEVER FASTENED WITH
ANYTHING BUT A LATCH EITHER BY DAY OR BY NIGHT
THEN TURNING TO THE GENDARMES
YOU MAY RETIRE GENTLEMEN
THE GENDARMES RETIRED
JEAN VALJEAN WAS LIKE A MAN ON THE POINT OF FAINTING
THE BISHOP DREW NEAR TO HIM AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE
DO NOT FORGET NEVER FORGET THAT YOU HAVE PROMISED TO USE THIS MONEY
IN BECOMING AN HONEST MAN
JEAN VALJEAN WHO HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF EVER HAVING PROMISED ANYTHING
REMAINED SPEECHLESS
THE BISHOP HAD EMPHASIZED THE WORDS WHEN HE UTTERED
THEM
HE RESUMED WITH SOLEMNITY
JEAN VALJEAN MY BROTHER YOU NO LONGER BELONG TO EVIL BUT TO GOOD
IT
IS YOUR SOUL THAT I BUY FROM YOU I WITHDRAW IT FROM BLACK THOUGHTS AND
THE SPIRIT OF PERDITION AND I GIVE IT TO GOD
CHAPTER XIII LITTLE GERVAIS
JEAN VALJEAN LEFT THE TOWN AS THOUGH HE WERE FLEEING FROM IT
HE SET OUT
AT A VERY HASTY PACE THROUGH THE FIELDS TAKING WHATEVER ROADS AND PATHS
PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HIM WITHOUT PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS INCESSANTLY
RETRACING HIS STEPS
HE WANDERED THUS THE WHOLE MORNING WITHOUT HAVING
EATEN ANYTHING AND WITHOUT FEELING HUNGRY
HE WAS THE PREY OF A THRONG
OF NOVEL SENSATIONS
HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A SORT OF RAGE HE DID NOT
KNOW AGAINST WHOM IT WAS DIRECTED
HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHETHER HE WAS
TOUCHED OR HUMILIATED
THERE CAME OVER HIM AT MOMENTS A STRANGE EMOTION
WHICH HE RESISTED AND TO WHICH HE OPPOSED THE HARDNESS ACQUIRED DURING
THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE
THIS STATE OF MIND FATIGUED HIM
HE PERCEIVED WITH DISMAY THAT THE SORT OF FRIGHTFUL CALM WHICH THE
INJUSTICE OF HIS MISFORTUNE HAD CONFERRED UPON HIM WAS GIVING WAY WITHIN
HIM
HE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT WOULD REPLACE THIS
AT TIMES HE WOULD HAVE
ACTUALLY PREFERRED TO BE IN PRISON WITH THE GENDARMES AND THAT THINGS
SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS WAY IT WOULD HAVE AGITATED HIM LESS
ALTHOUGH THE SEASON WAS TOLERABLY FAR ADVANCED THERE WERE STILL A FEW
LATE FLOWERS IN THE HEDGE ROWS HERE AND THERE WHOSE ODOR AS HE PASSED
THROUGH THEM IN HIS MARCH RECALLED TO HIM MEMORIES OF HIS CHILDHOOD
THESE MEMORIES WERE ALMOST INTOLERABLE TO HIM IT WAS SO LONG SINCE THEY
HAD RECURRED TO HIM
UNUTTERABLE THOUGHTS ASSEMBLED WITHIN HIM IN THIS MANNER ALL DAY LONG
AS THE SUN DECLINED TO ITS SETTING CASTING LONG SHADOWS ATHWART THE
SOIL FROM EVERY PEBBLE JEAN VALJEAN SAT DOWN BEHIND A BUSH UPON A LARGE
RUDDY PLAIN WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY DESERTED
THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE
HORIZON EXCEPT THE ALPS
NOT EVEN THE SPIRE OF A DISTANT VILLAGE
JEAN
VALJEAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN THREE LEAGUES DISTANT FROM D A PATH WHICH
INTERSECTED THE PLAIN PASSED A FEW PACES FROM THE BUSH
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS MEDITATION WHICH WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED NOT
A LITTLE TO RENDER HIS RAGS TERRIFYING TO ANY ONE WHO MIGHT HAVE
ENCOUNTERED HIM A JOYOUS SOUND BECAME AUDIBLE
HE TURNED HIS HEAD AND SAW A LITTLE SAVOYARD ABOUT TEN YEARS OF AGE
COMING UP THE PATH AND SINGING HIS HURDY GURDY ON HIS HIP AND HIS
MARMOT BOX ON HIS BACK
ONE OF THOSE GAY AND GENTLE CHILDREN WHO GO FROM LAND TO LAND AFFORDING
A VIEW OF THEIR KNEES THROUGH THE HOLES IN THEIR TROUSERS
WITHOUT STOPPING HIS SONG THE LAD HALTED IN HIS MARCH FROM TIME TO
TIME AND PLAYED AT KNUCKLE BONES WITH SOME COINS WHICH HE HAD IN HIS
HAND HIS WHOLE FORTUNE PROBABLY
AMONG THIS MONEY THERE WAS ONE FORTY SOU PIECE
THE CHILD HALTED BESIDE THE BUSH WITHOUT PERCEIVING JEAN VALJEAN AND
TOSSED UP HIS HANDFUL OF SOUS WHICH UP TO THAT TIME HE HAD CAUGHT
WITH A GOOD DEAL OF ADROITNESS ON THE BACK OF HIS HAND
THIS TIME THE FORTY SOU PIECE ESCAPED HIM AND WENT ROLLING TOWARDS THE
BRUSHWOOD UNTIL IT REACHED JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN SET HIS FOOT UPON IT
IN THE MEANTIME THE CHILD HAD LOOKED AFTER HIS COIN AND HAD CAUGHT
SIGHT OF HIM
HE SHOWED NO ASTONISHMENT BUT WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE MAN
THE SPOT WAS ABSOLUTELY SOLITARY
AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE THERE WAS
NOT A PERSON ON THE PLAIN OR ON THE PATH
THE ONLY SOUND WAS THE TINY
FEEBLE CRIES OF A FLOCK OF BIRDS OF PASSAGE WHICH WAS TRAVERSING THE
HEAVENS AT AN IMMENSE HEIGHT
THE CHILD WAS STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO
THE SUN WHICH CAST THREADS OF GOLD IN HIS HAIR AND EMPURPLED WITH ITS
BLOOD RED GLEAM THE SAVAGE FACE OF JEAN VALJEAN
SIR SAID THE LITTLE SAVOYARD WITH THAT CHILDISH CONFIDENCE WHICH IS
COMPOSED OF IGNORANCE AND INNOCENCE MY MONEY
WHAT IS YOUR NAME SAID JEAN VALJEAN
LITTLE GERVAIS SIR
GO AWAY SAID JEAN VALJEAN
SIR RESUMED THE CHILD GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY
JEAN VALJEAN DROPPED HIS HEAD AND MADE NO REPLY
THE CHILD BEGAN AGAIN MY MONEY SIR
JEAN VALJEAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE EARTH
MY PIECE OF MONEY CRIED THE CHILD MY WHITE PIECE MY SILVER
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT HEAR HIM
THE CHILD GRASPED HIM
BY THE COLLAR OF HIS BLOUSE AND SHOOK HIM
AT THE SAME TIME HE MADE AN
EFFORT TO DISPLACE THE BIG IRON SHOD SHOE WHICH RESTED ON HIS TREASURE
I WANT MY PIECE OF MONEY MY PIECE OF FORTY SOUS
THE CHILD WEPT
JEAN VALJEAN RAISED HIS HEAD
HE STILL REMAINED SEATED
HIS EYES WERE TROUBLED
HE GAZED AT THE CHILD IN A SORT OF AMAZEMENT
THEN HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TOWARDS HIS CUDGEL AND CRIED IN A
TERRIBLE VOICE WHO'S THERE
I SIR REPLIED THE CHILD
LITTLE GERVAIS I GIVE ME BACK MY FORTY
SOUS IF YOU PLEASE TAKE YOUR FOOT AWAY SIR IF YOU PLEASE
THEN IRRITATED THOUGH HE WAS SO SMALL AND BECOMING ALMOST MENACING
COME NOW WILL YOU TAKE YOUR FOOT AWAY TAKE YOUR FOOT AWAY OR WE'LL
SEE
AH IT'S STILL YOU SAID JEAN VALJEAN AND RISING ABRUPTLY TO HIS
FEET HIS FOOT STILL RESTING ON THE SILVER PIECE HE ADDED
WILL YOU TAKE YOURSELF OFF
THE FRIGHTENED CHILD LOOKED AT HIM THEN BEGAN TO TREMBLE FROM HEAD TO
FOOT AND AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF STUPOR HE SET OUT RUNNING AT THE TOP
OF HIS SPEED WITHOUT DARING TO TURN HIS NECK OR TO UTTER A CRY
NEVERTHELESS LACK OF BREATH FORCED HIM TO HALT AFTER A CERTAIN
DISTANCE AND JEAN VALJEAN HEARD HIM SOBBING IN THE MIDST OF HIS OWN
REVERY
AT THE END OF A FEW MOMENTS THE CHILD HAD DISAPPEARED
THE SUN HAD SET
THE SHADOWS WERE DESCENDING AROUND JEAN VALJEAN
HE HAD EATEN NOTHING
ALL DAY IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE WAS FEVERISH
HE HAD REMAINED STANDING AND HAD NOT CHANGED HIS ATTITUDE AFTER THE
CHILD'S FLIGHT
THE BREATH HEAVED HIS CHEST AT LONG AND IRREGULAR
INTERVALS
HIS GAZE FIXED TEN OR TWELVE PACES IN FRONT OF HIM SEEMED
TO BE SCRUTINIZING WITH PROFOUND ATTENTION THE SHAPE OF AN ANCIENT
FRAGMENT OF BLUE EARTHENWARE WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE GRASS
ALL AT ONCE
HE SHIVERED HE HAD JUST BEGUN TO FEEL THE CHILL OF EVENING
HE SETTLED HIS CAP MORE FIRMLY ON HIS BROW SOUGHT MECHANICALLY TO
CROSS AND BUTTON HIS BLOUSE ADVANCED A STEP AND STOPPED TO PICK UP HIS
CUDGEL
AT THAT MOMENT HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE FORTY SOU PIECE WHICH HIS FOOT
HAD HALF GROUND INTO THE EARTH AND WHICH WAS SHINING AMONG THE PEBBLES
IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED A GALVANIC SHOCK
WHAT IS THIS
HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
HE RECOILED THREE PACES THEN HALTED
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DETACH HIS GAZE FROM THE SPOT WHICH HIS FOOT HAD
TRODDEN BUT AN INSTANT BEFORE AS THOUGH THE THING WHICH LAY GLITTERING
THERE IN THE GLOOM HAD BEEN AN OPEN EYE RIVETED UPON HIM
AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MOMENTS HE DARTED CONVULSIVELY TOWARDS THE
SILVER COIN SEIZED IT AND STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND BEGAN TO
GAZE AFAR OFF OVER THE PLAIN AT THE SAME TIME CASTING HIS EYES TOWARDS
ALL POINTS OF THE HORIZON AS HE STOOD THERE ERECT AND SHIVERING LIKE A
TERRIFIED WILD ANIMAL WHICH IS SEEKING REFUGE
HE SAW NOTHING
NIGHT WAS FALLING THE PLAIN WAS COLD AND VAGUE GREAT
BANKS OF VIOLET HAZE WERE RISING IN THE GLEAM OF THE TWILIGHT
HE SAID AH AND SET OUT RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE CHILD
HAD DISAPPEARED
AFTER ABOUT THIRTY PACES HE PAUSED LOOKED ABOUT HIM
AND SAW NOTHING
THEN HE SHOUTED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
LITTLE GERVAIS LITTLE GERVAIS
HE PAUSED AND WAITED
THERE WAS NO REPLY
THE LANDSCAPE WAS GLOOMY AND DESERTED
HE WAS ENCOMPASSED BY SPACE
THERE WAS NOTHING AROUND HIM BUT AN OBSCURITY IN WHICH HIS GAZE WAS
LOST AND A SILENCE WHICH ENGULFED HIS VOICE
AN ICY NORTH WIND WAS BLOWING AND IMPARTED TO THINGS AROUND HIM A
SORT OF LUGUBRIOUS LIFE
THE BUSHES SHOOK THEIR THIN LITTLE ARMS WITH
INCREDIBLE FURY
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THEY WERE THREATENING AND
PURSUING SOME ONE
HE SET OUT ON HIS MARCH AGAIN THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN AND FROM TIME TO
TIME HE HALTED AND SHOUTED INTO THAT SOLITUDE WITH A VOICE WHICH WAS
THE MOST FORMIDABLE AND THE MOST DISCONSOLATE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO
HEAR LITTLE GERVAIS LITTLE GERVAIS
ASSUREDLY IF THE CHILD HAD HEARD HIM HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ALARMED AND
WOULD HAVE TAKEN GOOD CARE NOT TO SHOW HIMSELF
BUT THE CHILD WAS NO
DOUBT ALREADY FAR AWAY
HE ENCOUNTERED A PRIEST ON HORSEBACK
HE STEPPED UP TO HIM AND SAID
MONSIEUR LE CURE HAVE YOU SEEN A CHILD PASS
NO SAID THE PRIEST
ONE NAMED LITTLE GERVAIS
I HAVE SEEN NO ONE
HE DREW TWO FIVE FRANC PIECES FROM HIS MONEY BAG AND HANDED THEM TO THE
PRIEST
MONSIEUR LE CURE THIS IS FOR YOUR POOR PEOPLE
MONSIEUR LE CURE HE
WAS A LITTLE LAD ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD WITH A MARMOT I THINK AND A
HURDY GURDY
ONE OF THOSE SAVOYARDS YOU KNOW
I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM
LITTLE GERVAIS THERE ARE NO VILLAGES HERE CAN YOU TELL ME
IF HE IS LIKE WHAT YOU SAY MY FRIEND HE IS A LITTLE STRANGER
SUCH
PERSONS PASS THROUGH THESE PARTS
WE KNOW NOTHING OF THEM
JEAN VALJEAN SEIZED TWO MORE COINS OF FIVE FRANCS EACH WITH VIOLENCE
AND GAVE THEM TO THE PRIEST
FOR YOUR POOR HE SAID
THEN HE ADDED WILDLY
MONSIEUR L'ABBE HAVE ME ARRESTED
I AM A THIEF
THE PRIEST PUT SPURS TO HIS HORSE AND FLED IN HASTE MUCH ALARMED
JEAN VALJEAN SET OUT ON A RUN IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD FIRST
TAKEN
IN THIS WAY HE TRAVERSED A TOLERABLY LONG DISTANCE GAZING CALLING
SHOUTING BUT HE MET NO ONE
TWO OR THREE TIMES HE RAN ACROSS THE PLAIN
TOWARDS SOMETHING WHICH CONVEYED TO HIM THE EFFECT OF A HUMAN BEING
RECLINING OR CROUCHING DOWN IT TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING BUT BRUSHWOOD
OR ROCKS NEARLY ON A LEVEL WITH THE EARTH
AT LENGTH AT A SPOT WHERE
THREE PATHS INTERSECTED EACH OTHER HE STOPPED
THE MOON HAD RISEN
HE
SENT HIS GAZE INTO THE DISTANCE AND SHOUTED FOR THE LAST TIME LITTLE
GERVAIS LITTLE GERVAIS LITTLE GERVAIS HIS SHOUT DIED AWAY IN THE
MIST WITHOUT EVEN AWAKENING AN ECHO
HE MURMURED YET ONCE MORE LITTLE
GERVAIS BUT IN A FEEBLE AND ALMOST INARTICULATE VOICE
IT WAS HIS LAST
EFFORT HIS LEGS GAVE WAY ABRUPTLY UNDER HIM AS THOUGH AN INVISIBLE
POWER HAD SUDDENLY OVERWHELMED HIM WITH THE WEIGHT OF HIS EVIL
CONSCIENCE HE FELL EXHAUSTED ON A LARGE STONE HIS FISTS CLENCHED IN
HIS HAIR AND HIS FACE ON HIS KNEES AND HE CRIED I AM A WRETCH
THEN HIS HEART BURST AND HE BEGAN TO CRY
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT HE
HAD WEPT IN NINETEEN YEARS
WHEN JEAN VALJEAN LEFT THE BISHOP'S HOUSE HE WAS AS WE HAVE SEEN
QUITE THROWN OUT OF EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEEN HIS THOUGHT HITHERTO
HE
COULD NOT YIELD TO THE EVIDENCE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITHIN HIM
HE
HARDENED HIMSELF AGAINST THE ANGELIC ACTION AND THE GENTLE WORDS OF THE
OLD MAN
YOU HAVE PROMISED ME TO BECOME AN HONEST MAN
I BUY YOUR SOUL
I TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE SPIRIT OF PERVERSITY I GIVE IT TO THE GOOD
GOD
THIS RECURRED TO HIS MIND UNCEASINGLY
TO THIS CELESTIAL KINDNESS
HE OPPOSED PRIDE WHICH IS THE FORTRESS OF EVIL WITHIN US
HE WAS
INDISTINCTLY CONSCIOUS THAT THE PARDON OF THIS PRIEST WAS THE GREATEST
ASSAULT AND THE MOST FORMIDABLE ATTACK WHICH HAD MOVED HIM YET THAT HIS
OBDURACY WAS FINALLY SETTLED IF HE RESISTED THIS CLEMENCY THAT IF HE
YIELDED HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THAT HATRED WITH WHICH THE
ACTIONS OF OTHER MEN HAD FILLED HIS SOUL THROUGH SO MANY YEARS AND
WHICH PLEASED HIM THAT THIS TIME IT WAS NECESSARY TO CONQUER OR TO BE
CONQUERED AND THAT A STRUGGLE A COLOSSAL AND FINAL STRUGGLE HAD BEEN
BEGUN BETWEEN HIS VICIOUSNESS AND THE GOODNESS OF THAT MAN
IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE LIGHTS HE PROCEEDED LIKE A MAN WHO IS
INTOXICATED
AS HE WALKED THUS WITH HAGGARD EYES DID HE HAVE A DISTINCT
PERCEPTION OF WHAT MIGHT RESULT TO HIM FROM HIS ADVENTURE AT D DID
HE UNDERSTAND ALL THOSE MYSTERIOUS MURMURS WHICH WARN OR IMPORTUNE THE
SPIRIT AT CERTAIN MOMENTS OF LIFE DID A VOICE WHISPER IN HIS EAR THAT
HE HAD JUST PASSED THE SOLEMN HOUR OF HIS DESTINY THAT THERE NO LONGER
REMAINED A MIDDLE COURSE FOR HIM THAT IF HE WERE NOT HENCEFORTH THE
BEST OF MEN HE WOULD BE THE WORST THAT IT BEHOOVED HIM NOW SO TO
SPEAK TO MOUNT HIGHER THAN THE BISHOP OR FALL LOWER THAN THE CONVICT
THAT IF HE WISHED TO BECOME GOOD BE MUST BECOME AN ANGEL THAT IF HE
WISHED TO REMAIN EVIL HE MUST BECOME A MONSTER
HERE AGAIN SOME QUESTIONS MUST BE PUT WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY PUT
TO OURSELVES ELSEWHERE DID HE CATCH SOME SHADOW OF ALL THIS IN HIS
THOUGHT IN A CONFUSED WAY MISFORTUNE CERTAINLY AS WE HAVE SAID DOES
FORM THE EDUCATION OF THE INTELLIGENCE NEVERTHELESS IT IS DOUBTFUL
WHETHER JEAN VALJEAN WAS IN A CONDITION TO DISENTANGLE ALL THAT WE HAVE
HERE INDICATED
IF THESE IDEAS OCCURRED TO HIM HE BUT CAUGHT GLIMPSES
OF RATHER THAN SAW THEM AND THEY ONLY SUCCEEDED IN THROWING HIM INTO
AN UNUTTERABLE AND ALMOST PAINFUL STATE OF EMOTION
ON EMERGING FROM
THAT BLACK AND DEFORMED THING WHICH IS CALLED THE GALLEYS THE BISHOP
HAD HURT HIS SOUL AS TOO VIVID A LIGHT WOULD HAVE HURT HIS EYES ON
EMERGING FROM THE DARK
THE FUTURE LIFE THE POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH OFFERED
ITSELF TO HIM HENCEFORTH ALL PURE AND RADIANT FILLED HIM WITH TREMORS
AND ANXIETY
HE NO LONGER KNEW WHERE HE REALLY WAS
LIKE AN OWL WHO
SHOULD SUDDENLY SEE THE SUN RISE THE CONVICT HAD BEEN DAZZLED AND
BLINDED AS IT WERE BY VIRTUE
THAT WHICH WAS CERTAIN THAT WHICH HE DID NOT DOUBT WAS THAT HE WAS NO
LONGER THE SAME MAN THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS CHANGED THAT IT WAS
NO LONGER IN HIS POWER TO MAKE IT AS THOUGH THE BISHOP HAD NOT SPOKEN TO
HIM AND HAD NOT TOUCHED HIM
IN THIS STATE OF MIND HE HAD ENCOUNTERED LITTLE GERVAIS AND HAD ROBBED
HIM OF HIS FORTY SOUS
WHY HE CERTAINLY COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED IT
WAS THIS THE LAST EFFECT AND THE SUPREME EFFORT AS IT WERE OF THE
EVIL THOUGHTS WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT AWAY FROM THE GALLEYS A REMNANT OF
IMPULSE A RESULT OF WHAT IS CALLED IN STATICS ACQUIRED FORCE IT
WAS THAT AND IT WAS ALSO PERHAPS EVEN LESS THAN THAT
LET US SAY IT
SIMPLY IT WAS NOT HE WHO STOLE IT WAS NOT THE MAN IT WAS THE BEAST
WHO BY HABIT AND INSTINCT HAD SIMPLY PLACED HIS FOOT UPON THAT MONEY
WHILE THE INTELLIGENCE WAS STRUGGLING AMID SO MANY NOVEL AND HITHERTO
UNHEARD OF THOUGHTS BESETTING IT
WHEN INTELLIGENCE RE AWAKENED AND BEHELD THAT ACTION OF THE BRUTE JEAN
VALJEAN RECOILED WITH ANGUISH AND UTTERED A CRY OF TERROR
ILLUSTRATION AWAKENED 1B2 11 AWAKENED
IT WAS BECAUSE STRANGE PHENOMENON AND ONE WHICH WAS POSSIBLE ONLY
IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF IN STEALING THE MONEY FROM
THAT CHILD HE HAD DONE A THING OF WHICH HE WAS NO LONGER CAPABLE
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE THIS LAST EVIL ACTION HAD A DECISIVE EFFECT ON
HIM IT ABRUPTLY TRAVERSED THAT CHAOS WHICH HE BORE IN HIS MIND AND
DISPERSED IT PLACED ON ONE SIDE THE THICK OBSCURITY AND ON THE OTHER
THE LIGHT AND ACTED ON HIS SOUL IN THE STATE IN WHICH IT THEN WAS AS
CERTAIN CHEMICAL REAGENTS ACT UPON A TROUBLED MIXTURE BY PRECIPITATING
ONE ELEMENT AND CLARIFYING THE OTHER
FIRST OF ALL EVEN BEFORE EXAMINING HIMSELF AND REFLECTING ALL
BEWILDERED LIKE ONE WHO SEEKS TO SAVE HIMSELF HE TRIED TO FIND THE
CHILD IN ORDER TO RETURN HIS MONEY TO HIM THEN WHEN HE RECOGNIZED THE
FACT THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE HALTED IN DESPAIR
AT THE MOMENT WHEN
HE EXCLAIMED I AM A WRETCH HE HAD JUST PERCEIVED WHAT HE WAS AND HE
WAS ALREADY SEPARATED FROM HIMSELF TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE SEEMED TO
HIMSELF TO BE NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE THAN A PHANTOM AND AS IF HE HAD
THERE BEFORE HIM IN FLESH AND BLOOD THE HIDEOUS GALLEY CONVICT JEAN
VALJEAN CUDGEL IN HAND HIS BLOUSE ON HIS HIPS HIS KNAPSACK FILLED
WITH STOLEN OBJECTS ON HIS BACK WITH HIS RESOLUTE AND GLOOMY VISAGE
WITH HIS THOUGHTS FILLED WITH ABOMINABLE PROJECTS
EXCESS OF UNHAPPINESS HAD AS WE HAVE REMARKED MADE HIM IN SOME SORT
A VISIONARY
THIS THEN WAS IN THE NATURE OF A VISION
HE ACTUALLY SAW
THAT JEAN VALJEAN THAT SINISTER FACE BEFORE HIM
HE HAD ALMOST REACHED
THE POINT OF ASKING HIMSELF WHO THAT MAN WAS AND HE WAS HORRIFIED BY
HIM
HIS BRAIN WAS GOING THROUGH ONE OF THOSE VIOLENT AND YET PERFECTLY CALM
MOMENTS IN WHICH REVERY IS SO PROFOUND THAT IT ABSORBS REALITY
ONE NO
LONGER BEHOLDS THE OBJECT WHICH ONE HAS BEFORE ONE AND ONE SEES AS
THOUGH APART FROM ONE'S SELF THE FIGURES WHICH ONE HAS IN ONE'S OWN
MIND
THUS HE CONTEMPLATED HIMSELF SO TO SPEAK FACE TO FACE AND AT THE SAME
TIME ATHWART THIS HALLUCINATION HE PERCEIVED IN A MYSTERIOUS DEPTH A
SORT OF LIGHT WHICH HE AT FIRST TOOK FOR A TORCH
ON SCRUTINIZING
THIS LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO HIS CONSCIENCE WITH MORE ATTENTION HE
RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT IT POSSESSED A HUMAN FORM AND THAT THIS TORCH
WAS THE BISHOP
HIS CONSCIENCE WEIGHED IN TURN THESE TWO MEN THUS PLACED BEFORE IT THE
BISHOP AND JEAN VALJEAN
NOTHING LESS THAN THE FIRST WAS REQUIRED TO
SOFTEN THE SECOND
BY ONE OF THOSE SINGULAR EFFECTS WHICH ARE PECULIAR
TO THIS SORT OF ECSTASIES IN PROPORTION AS HIS REVERY CONTINUED AS THE
BISHOP GREW GREAT AND RESPLENDENT IN HIS EYES SO DID JEAN VALJEAN GROW
LESS AND VANISH
AFTER A CERTAIN TIME HE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE
THAN A SHADE
ALL AT ONCE HE DISAPPEARED
THE BISHOP ALONE REMAINED HE
FILLED THE WHOLE SOUL OF THIS WRETCHED MAN WITH A MAGNIFICENT RADIANCE
JEAN VALJEAN WEPT FOR A LONG TIME
HE WEPT BURNING TEARS HE SOBBED WITH
MORE WEAKNESS THAN A WOMAN WITH MORE FRIGHT THAN A CHILD
AS HE WEPT DAYLIGHT PENETRATED MORE AND MORE CLEARLY INTO HIS SOUL AN
EXTRAORDINARY LIGHT A LIGHT AT ONCE RAVISHING AND TERRIBLE
HIS PAST
LIFE HIS FIRST FAULT HIS LONG EXPIATION HIS EXTERNAL BRUTISHNESS HIS
INTERNAL HARDNESS HIS DISMISSAL TO LIBERTY REJOICING IN MANIFOLD PLANS
OF VENGEANCE WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE BISHOP'S THE LAST THING
THAT HE HAD DONE THAT THEFT OF FORTY SOUS FROM A CHILD A CRIME ALL THE
MORE COWARDLY AND ALL THE MORE MONSTROUS SINCE IT HAD COME AFTER THE
BISHOP'S PARDON ALL THIS RECURRED TO HIS MIND AND APPEARED CLEARLY
TO HIM BUT WITH A CLEARNESS WHICH HE HAD NEVER HITHERTO WITNESSED
HE EXAMINED HIS LIFE AND IT SEEMED HORRIBLE TO HIM HIS SOUL AND IT
SEEMED FRIGHTFUL TO HIM
IN THE MEANTIME A GENTLE LIGHT RESTED OVER THIS
LIFE AND THIS SOUL
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE BEHELD SATAN BY THE LIGHT
OF PARADISE
HOW MANY HOURS DID HE WEEP THUS WHAT DID HE DO AFTER HE HAD WEPT
WHITHER DID HE GO NO ONE EVER KNEW
THE ONLY THING WHICH SEEMS TO BE
AUTHENTICATED IS THAT THAT SAME NIGHT THE CARRIER WHO SERVED GRENOBLE AT
THAT EPOCH AND WHO ARRIVED AT D ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
SAW AS HE TRAVERSED THE STREET IN WHICH THE BISHOP'S RESIDENCE WAS
SITUATED A MAN IN THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER KNEELING ON THE PAVEMENT IN
THE SHADOW IN FRONT OF THE DOOR OF MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME

BOTH OF THEM HAD CELEBRATED ON THE 14TH OF JULY 1790 THE MASS OF
FEDERATION IN THE CHAMP DE MARS TALLEYRAND HAD SAID IT AS BISHOP LOUIS
HAD SERVED IT IN THE CAPACITY OF DEACON
IN 1817 IN THE SIDE ALLEYS
OF THIS SAME CHAMP DE MARS TWO GREAT CYLINDERS OF WOOD MIGHT HAVE
BEEN SEEN LYING IN THE RAIN ROTTING AMID THE GRASS PAINTED BLUE WITH
TRACES OF EAGLES AND BEES FROM WHICH THE GILDING WAS FALLING
THESE
WERE THE COLUMNS WHICH TWO YEARS BEFORE HAD UPHELD THE EMPEROR'S
PLATFORM IN THE CHAMP DE MAI
THEY WERE BLACKENED HERE AND THERE WITH
THE SCORCHES OF THE BIVOUAC OF AUSTRIANS ENCAMPED NEAR GROS CAILLOU

THE FIELD OF MARCH MARS
IN THIS YEAR 1817 TWO THINGS WERE POPULAR
THE VOLTAIRE TOUQUET AND THE SNUFF BOX A LA CHARTER
THE MOST RECENT
PARISIAN SENSATION WAS THE CRIME OF DAUTUN WHO HAD THROWN HIS BROTHER'S
HEAD INTO THE FOUNTAIN OF THE FLOWER MARKET
THEY HAD BEGUN TO FEEL ANXIOUS AT THE NAVAL DEPARTMENT ON ACCOUNT OF
THE LACK OF NEWS FROM THAT FATAL FRIGATE THE MEDUSA WHICH WAS DESTINED

EPOCH
THE INSTITUTE HAD THE ACADEMICIAN NAPOLEON BONAPARTE STRICKEN
FROM ITS LIST OF MEMBERS
A ROYAL ORDINANCE ERECTED ANGOULEME INTO A
NAVAL SCHOOL FOR THE DUC D'ANGOULEME BEING LORD HIGH ADMIRAL IT WAS
EVIDENT THAT THE CITY OF ANGOULEME HAD ALL THE QUALITIES OF A SEAPORT
OTHERWISE THE MONARCHICAL PRINCIPLE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A WOUND
IN
THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS THE QUESTION WAS AGITATED WHETHER VIGNETTES
REPRESENTING SLACK ROPE PERFORMANCES WHICH ADORNED FRANCONI'S
ADVERTISING POSTERS AND WHICH ATTRACTED THRONGS OF STREET URCHINS
SHOULD BE TOLERATED

THE GRAND NEWSPAPERS WERE ALL VERY SMALL
THEIR FORM WAS RESTRICTED
BUT THEIR LIBERTY WAS GREAT
THE CONSTITUTIONNEL WAS CONSTITUTIONAL
LA MINERVE CALLED CHATEAUBRIAND CHATEAUBRIANT
THAT MADE THE GOOD
MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE LAUGH HEARTILY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE GREAT WRITER

EXILES OF 1815
DAVID HAD NO LONGER ANY TALENT ARNAULT HAD NO LONGER
ANY WIT CARNOT WAS NO LONGER HONEST SOULT HAD WON NO BATTLES IT IS
TRUE THAT NAPOLEON HAD NO LONGER ANY GENIUS
NO ONE IS IGNORANT OF THE
FACT THAT LETTERS SENT TO AN EXILE BY POST VERY RARELY REACHED HIM AS
THE POLICE MADE IT THEIR RELIGIOUS DUTY TO INTERCEPT THEM
THIS IS NO
NEW FACT DESCARTES COMPLAINED OF IT IN HIS EXILE
NOW DAVID HAVING IN
A BELGIAN PUBLICATION SHOWN SOME DISPLEASURE AT NOT RECEIVING LETTERS
WHICH HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO HIM IT STRUCK THE ROYALIST JOURNALS AS
AMUSING AND THEY DERIDED THE PRESCRIBED MAN WELL ON THIS OCCASION
WHAT
SEPARATED TWO MEN MORE THAN AN ABYSS WAS TO SAY THE REGICIDES OR
TO SAY THE VOTERS TO SAY THE ENEMIES OR TO SAY THE ALLIES TO SAY
NAPOLEON OR TO SAY BUONAPARTE

TRAITORS SHOWED THEMSELVES UNBUTTONED MEN WHO HAD GONE OVER TO THE
ENEMY ON THE EVE OF BATTLE MADE NO SECRET OF THEIR RECOMPENSE AND
STRUTTED IMMODESTLY IN THE LIGHT OF DAY IN THE CYNICISM OF RICHES AND
DIGNITIES DESERTERS FROM LIGNY AND QUATRE BRAS IN THE BRAZENNESS OF
THEIR WELL PAID TURPITUDE EXHIBITED THEIR DEVOTION TO THE MONARCHY IN
THE MOST BAREFACED MANNER
THIS IS WHAT FLOATS UP CONFUSEDLY PELL MELL FOR THE YEAR 1817 AND IS
NOW FORGOTTEN
HISTORY NEGLECTS NEARLY ALL THESE PARTICULARS AND CANNOT
DO OTHERWISE THE INFINITY WOULD OVERWHELM IT
NEVERTHELESS THESE
DETAILS WHICH ARE WRONGLY CALLED TRIVIAL THERE ARE NO TRIVIAL FACTS
IN HUMANITY NOR LITTLE LEAVES IN VEGETATION ARE USEFUL
IT IS OF
THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE YEARS THAT THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE CENTURIES IS
COMPOSED
IN THIS YEAR OF 1817 FOUR YOUNG PARISIANS ARRANGED A FINE
FARCE
CHAPTER II A DOUBLE QUARTETTE
THESE PARISIANS CAME ONE FROM TOULOUSE ANOTHER FROM LIMOGES THE THIRD
FROM CAHORS AND THE FOURTH FROM MONTAUBAN BUT THEY WERE STUDENTS AND
WHEN ONE SAYS STUDENT ONE SAYS PARISIAN TO STUDY IN PARIS IS TO BE
BORN IN PARIS
THESE YOUNG MEN WERE INSIGNIFICANT EVERY ONE HAS SEEN SUCH FACES FOUR
SPECIMENS OF HUMANITY TAKEN AT RANDOM NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD NEITHER
WISE NOR IGNORANT NEITHER GENIUSES NOR FOOLS HANDSOME WITH THAT
CHARMING APRIL WHICH IS CALLED TWENTY YEARS
THEY WERE FOUR OSCARS FOR
AT THAT EPOCH ARTHURS DID NOT YET EXIST
BURN FOR HIM THE PERFUMES OF
ARABY EXCLAIMED ROMANCE
OSCAR ADVANCES
OSCAR I SHALL BEHOLD HIM
PEOPLE HAD JUST EMERGED FROM OSSIAN ELEGANCE WAS SCANDINAVIAN AND
CALEDONIAN THE PURE ENGLISH STYLE WAS ONLY TO PREVAIL LATER AND
THE FIRST OF THE ARTHURS WELLINGTON HAD BUT JUST WON THE BATTLE OF
WATERLOO
THESE OSCARS BORE THE NAMES ONE OF FELIX THOLOMYES OF TOULOUSE THE
SECOND LISTOLIER OF CAHORS THE NEXT FAMEUIL OF LIMOGES THE LAST
BLACHEVELLE OF MONTAUBAN
NATURALLY EACH OF THEM HAD HIS MISTRESS
BLACHEVELLE LOVED FAVOURITE SO NAMED BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN IN ENGLAND
LISTOLIER ADORED DAHLIA WHO HAD TAKEN FOR HER NICKNAME THE NAME OF A
FLOWER FAMEUIL IDOLIZED ZEPHINE AN ABRIDGMENT OF JOSEPHINE THOLOMYES
HAD FANTINE CALLED THE BLONDE BECAUSE OF HER BEAUTIFUL SUNNY HAIR
FAVOURITE DAHLIA ZEPHINE AND FANTINE WERE FOUR RAVISHING YOUNG WOMEN
PERFUMED AND RADIANT STILL A LITTLE LIKE WORKING WOMEN AND NOT YET
ENTIRELY DIVORCED FROM THEIR NEEDLES SOMEWHAT DISTURBED BY INTRIGUES
BUT STILL RETAINING ON THEIR FACES SOMETHING OF THE SERENITY OF TOIL
AND IN THEIR SOULS THAT FLOWER OF HONESTY WHICH SURVIVES THE FIRST FALL
IN WOMAN
ONE OF THE FOUR WAS CALLED THE YOUNG BECAUSE SHE WAS
THE YOUNGEST OF THEM AND ONE WAS CALLED THE OLD THE OLD ONE WAS
TWENTY THREE
NOT TO CONCEAL ANYTHING THE THREE FIRST WERE MORE
EXPERIENCED MORE HEEDLESS AND MORE EMANCIPATED INTO THE TUMULT OF LIFE
THAN FANTINE THE BLONDE WHO WAS STILL IN HER FIRST ILLUSIONS
DAHLIA ZEPHINE AND ESPECIALLY FAVOURITE COULD NOT HAVE SAID AS MUCH
THERE HAD ALREADY BEEN MORE THAN ONE EPISODE IN THEIR ROMANCE THOUGH
HARDLY BEGUN AND THE LOVER WHO HAD BORNE THE NAME OF ADOLPH IN THE
FIRST CHAPTER HAD TURNED OUT TO BE ALPHONSE IN THE SECOND AND GUSTAVE
IN THE THIRD
POVERTY AND COQUETRY ARE TWO FATAL COUNSELLORS ONE SCOLDS
AND THE OTHER FLATTERS AND THE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS OF THE PEOPLE HAVE
BOTH OF THEM WHISPERING IN THEIR EAR EACH ON ITS OWN SIDE
THESE BADLY
GUARDED SOULS LISTEN
HENCE THE FALLS WHICH THEY ACCOMPLISH AND THE
STONES WHICH ARE THROWN AT THEM
THEY ARE OVERWHELMED WITH SPLENDOR OF
ALL THAT IS IMMACULATE AND INACCESSIBLE
ALAS WHAT IF THE JUNGFRAU WERE
HUNGRY
FAVOURITE HAVING BEEN IN ENGLAND WAS ADMIRED BY DAHLIA AND ZEPHINE
SHE
HAD HAD AN ESTABLISHMENT OF HER OWN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
HER FATHER WAS
AN OLD UNMARRIED PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS A BRUTAL MAN AND A BRAGGART
WHO WENT OUT TO GIVE LESSONS IN SPITE OF HIS AGE
THIS PROFESSOR WHEN
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN HAD ONE DAY SEEN A CHAMBERMAID'S GOWN CATCH ON
A FENDER HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ACCIDENT
THE
RESULT HAD BEEN FAVOURITE
SHE MET HER FATHER FROM TIME TO TIME AND HE
BOWED TO HER
ONE MORNING AN OLD WOMAN WITH THE AIR OF A DEVOTEE
HAD ENTERED HER APARTMENTS AND HAD SAID TO HER YOU DO NOT KNOW ME
MAMEMOISELLE NO I AM YOUR MOTHER THEN THE OLD WOMAN OPENED THE
SIDEBOARD AND ATE AND DRANK HAD A MATTRESS WHICH SHE OWNED BROUGHT IN
AND INSTALLED HERSELF
THIS CROSS AND PIOUS OLD MOTHER NEVER SPOKE TO
FAVOURITE REMAINED HOURS WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD BREAKFASTED DINED
AND SUPPED FOR FOUR AND WENT DOWN TO THE PORTER'S QUARTERS FOR COMPANY
WHERE SHE SPOKE ILL OF HER DAUGHTER
IT WAS HAVING ROSY NAILS THAT WERE TOO PRETTY WHICH HAD DRAWN DAHLIA TO
LISTOLIER TO OTHERS PERHAPS TO IDLENESS
HOW COULD SHE MAKE SUCH NAILS
WORK SHE WHO WISHES TO REMAIN VIRTUOUS MUST NOT HAVE PITY ON HER HANDS
AS FOR ZEPHINE SHE HAD CONQUERED FAMEUIL BY HER ROGUISH AND CARESSING
LITTLE WAY OF SAYING YES SIR
THE YOUNG MEN WERE COMRADES THE YOUNG GIRLS WERE FRIENDS
SUCH LOVES
ARE ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH FRIENDSHIPS
GOODNESS AND PHILOSOPHY ARE TWO DISTINCT THINGS THE PROOF OF THIS
IS THAT AFTER MAKING ALL DUE ALLOWANCES FOR THESE LITTLE IRREGULAR
HOUSEHOLDS FAVOURITE ZEPHINE AND DAHLIA WERE PHILOSOPHICAL YOUNG
WOMEN WHILE FANTINE WAS A GOOD GIRL
GOOD SOME ONE WILL EXCLAIM AND THOLOMYES SOLOMON WOULD REPLY THAT
LOVE FORMS A PART OF WISDOM
WE WILL CONFINE OURSELVES TO SAYING THAT
THE LOVE OF FANTINE WAS A FIRST LOVE A SOLE LOVE A FAITHFUL LOVE
SHE ALONE OF ALL THE FOUR WAS NOT CALLED THOU BY A SINGLE ONE OF
THEM
FANTINE WAS ONE OF THOSE BEINGS WHO BLOSSOM SO TO SPEAK FROM THE DREGS
OF THE PEOPLE
THOUGH SHE HAD EMERGED FROM THE MOST UNFATHOMABLE DEPTHS
OF SOCIAL SHADOW SHE BORE ON HER BROW THE SIGN OF THE ANONYMOUS AND THE
UNKNOWN
SHE WAS BORN AT M
SUR M
OF WHAT PARENTS WHO CAN SAY SHE HAD
NEVER KNOWN FATHER OR MOTHER
SHE WAS CALLED FANTINE
WHY FANTINE SHE
HAD NEVER BORNE ANY OTHER NAME
AT THE EPOCH OF HER BIRTH THE DIRECTORY
STILL EXISTED
SHE HAD NO FAMILY NAME SHE HAD NO FAMILY NO BAPTISMAL
NAME THE CHURCH NO LONGER EXISTED
SHE BORE THE NAME WHICH PLEASED
THE FIRST RANDOM PASSER BY WHO HAD ENCOUNTERED HER WHEN A VERY SMALL
CHILD RUNNING BARE LEGGED IN THE STREET
SHE RECEIVED THE NAME AS SHE
RECEIVED THE WATER FROM THE CLOUDS UPON HER BROW WHEN IT RAINED
SHE WAS
CALLED LITTLE FANTINE
NO ONE KNEW MORE THAN THAT
THIS HUMAN CREATURE
HAD ENTERED LIFE IN JUST THIS WAY
AT THE AGE OF TEN FANTINE QUITTED
THE TOWN AND WENT TO SERVICE WITH SOME FARMERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AT
FIFTEEN SHE CAME TO PARIS TO SEEK HER FORTUNE FANTINE WAS BEAUTIFUL
AND REMAINED PURE AS LONG AS SHE COULD
SHE WAS A LOVELY BLONDE WITH
FINE TEETH
SHE HAD GOLD AND PEARLS FOR HER DOWRY BUT HER GOLD WAS ON
HER HEAD AND HER PEARLS WERE IN HER MOUTH
SHE WORKED FOR HER LIVING THEN STILL FOR THE SAKE OF HER LIVING FOR
THE HEART ALSO HAS ITS HUNGER SHE LOVED
SHE LOVED THOLOMYES
AN AMOUR FOR HIM PASSION FOR HER
THE STREETS OF THE LATIN QUARTER
FILLED WITH THRONGS OF STUDENTS AND GRISETTES SAW THE BEGINNING OF
THEIR DREAM
FANTINE HAD LONG EVADED THOLOMYES IN THE MAZES OF THE HILL
OF THE PANTHEON WHERE SO MANY ADVENTURERS TWINE AND UNTWINE BUT IN
SUCH A WAY AS CONSTANTLY TO ENCOUNTER HIM AGAIN
THERE IS A WAY OF
AVOIDING WHICH RESEMBLES SEEKING
IN SHORT THE ECLOGUE TOOK PLACE
BLACHEVELLE LISTOLIER AND FAMEUIL FORMED A SORT OF GROUP OF WHICH
THOLOMYES WAS THE HEAD
IT WAS HE WHO POSSESSED THE WIT
THOLOMYES WAS THE ANTIQUE OLD STUDENT HE WAS RICH HE HAD AN INCOME OF
FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS A SPLENDID SCANDAL ON
MOUNT SAINTE GENEVIEVE
THOLOMYES WAS A FAST MAN OF THIRTY AND BADLY
PRESERVED
HE WAS WRINKLED AND TOOTHLESS AND HE HAD THE BEGINNING OF A
BALD SPOT OF WHICH HE HIMSELF SAID WITH SADNESS THE SKULL AT THIRTY
THE KNEE AT FORTY
HIS DIGESTION WAS MEDIOCRE AND HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED
BY A WATERING IN ONE EYE
BUT IN PROPORTION AS HIS YOUTH DISAPPEARED
GAYETY WAS KINDLED HE REPLACED HIS TEETH WITH BUFFOONERIES HIS HAIR
WITH MIRTH HIS HEALTH WITH IRONY HIS WEEPING EYE LAUGHED INCESSANTLY
HE WAS DILAPIDATED BUT STILL IN FLOWER
HIS YOUTH WHICH WAS PACKING
UP FOR DEPARTURE LONG BEFORE ITS TIME BEAT A RETREAT IN GOOD ORDER
BURSTING WITH LAUGHTER AND NO ONE SAW ANYTHING BUT FIRE
HE HAD HAD A
PIECE REJECTED AT THE VAUDEVILLE
HE MADE A FEW VERSES NOW AND THEN
IN
ADDITION TO THIS HE DOUBTED EVERYTHING TO THE LAST DEGREE WHICH IS A
VAST FORCE IN THE EYES OF THE WEAK
BEING THUS IRONICAL AND BALD HE
WAS THE LEADER
IRON IS AN ENGLISH WORD
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IRONY IS
DERIVED FROM IT
ONE DAY THOLOMYES TOOK THE THREE OTHERS ASIDE WITH THE GESTURE OF AN
ORACLE AND SAID TO THEM
FANTINE DAHLIA ZEPHINE AND FAVOURITE HAVE BEEN TEASING US FOR NEARLY
A YEAR TO GIVE THEM A SURPRISE
WE HAVE PROMISED THEM SOLEMNLY THAT WE
WOULD
THEY ARE FOREVER TALKING ABOUT IT TO US TO ME IN PARTICULAR
JUST AS THE OLD WOMEN IN NAPLES CRY TO SAINT JANUARIUS 'FACCIA
GIALLUTA FA O MIRACOLO YELLOW FACE PERFORM THY MIRACLE SO OUR
BEAUTIES SAY TO ME INCESSANTLY 'THOLOMYES WHEN WILL YOU BRING FORTH
YOUR SURPRISE AT THE SAME TIME OUR PARENTS KEEP WRITING TO US
PRESSURE ON BOTH SIDES
THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED IT SEEMS TO ME LET US
DISCUSS THE QUESTION
THEREUPON THOLOMYES LOWERED HIS VOICE AND ARTICULATED SOMETHING SO
MIRTHFUL THAT A VAST AND ENTHUSIASTIC GRIN BROKE OUT UPON THE FOUR
MOUTHS SIMULTANEOUSLY AND BLACHEVELLE EXCLAIMED THAT IS AN IDEA
A SMOKY TAP ROOM PRESENTED ITSELF THEY ENTERED AND THE REMAINDER OF
THEIR CONFIDENTIAL COLLOQUY WAS LOST IN SHADOW
THE RESULT OF THESE SHADES WAS A DAZZLING PLEASURE PARTY WHICH TOOK
PLACE ON THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY THE FOUR YOUNG MEN INVITING THE FOUR
YOUNG GIRLS
CHAPTER III FOUR AND FOUR
IT IS HARD NOWADAYS TO PICTURE TO ONE'S SELF WHAT A PLEASURE TRIP OF
STUDENTS AND GRISETTES TO THE COUNTRY WAS LIKE FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO
THE SUBURBS OF PARIS ARE NO LONGER THE SAME THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF WHAT
MAY BE CALLED CIRCUMPARISIAN LIFE HAS CHANGED COMPLETELY IN THE LAST
HALF CENTURY WHERE THERE WAS THE CUCKOO THERE IS THE RAILWAY CAR
WHERE THERE WAS A TENDER BOAT THERE IS NOW THE STEAMBOAT PEOPLE SPEAK
OF FECAMP NOWADAYS AS THEY SPOKE OF SAINT CLOUD IN THOSE DAYS
THE PARIS
OF 1862 IS A CITY WHICH HAS FRANCE FOR ITS OUTSKIRTS
THE FOUR COUPLES CONSCIENTIOUSLY WENT THROUGH WITH ALL THE COUNTRY
FOLLIES POSSIBLE AT THAT TIME
THE VACATION WAS BEGINNING AND IT WAS A
WARM BRIGHT SUMMER DAY
ON THE PRECEDING DAY FAVOURITE THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNEW HOW TO WRITE HAD WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING TO THOLOMYES IN THE
NAME OF THE FOUR IT IS A GOOD HOUR TO EMERGE FROM HAPPINESS THAT
IS WHY THEY ROSE AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THEN THEY WENT TO
SAINT CLOUD BY THE COACH LOOKED AT THE DRY CASCADE AND EXCLAIMED THIS
MUST BE VERY BEAUTIFUL WHEN THERE IS WATER THEY BREAKFASTED AT THE
TETE NOIR WHERE CASTAING HAD NOT YET BEEN THEY TREATED THEMSELVES TO A
GAME OF RING THROWING UNDER THE QUINCUNX OF TREES OF THE GRAND FOUNTAIN
THEY ASCENDED DIOGENES' LANTERN THEY GAMBLED FOR MACAROONS AT THE
ROULETTE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PONT DE SEVRES PICKED BOUQUETS AT
PATEAUX BOUGHT REED PIPES AT NEUILLY ATE APPLE TARTS EVERYWHERE AND
WERE PERFECTLY HAPPY
THE YOUNG GIRLS RUSTLED AND CHATTED LIKE WARBLERS ESCAPED FROM THEIR
CAGE
IT WAS A PERFECT DELIRIUM
FROM TIME TO TIME THEY BESTOWED LITTLE
TAPS ON THE YOUNG MEN
MATUTINAL INTOXICATION OF LIFE ADORABLE YEARS
THE WINGS OF THE DRAGONFLY QUIVER
OH WHOEVER YOU MAY BE DO YOU NOT
REMEMBER HAVE YOU RAMBLED THROUGH THE BRUSHWOOD HOLDING ASIDE THE
BRANCHES ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHARMING HEAD WHICH IS COMING ON BEHIND YOU
HAVE YOU SLID LAUGHING DOWN A SLOPE ALL WET WITH RAIN WITH A BELOVED
WOMAN HOLDING YOUR HAND AND CRYING AH MY NEW BOOTS WHAT A STATE
THEY ARE IN
LET US SAY AT ONCE THAT THAT MERRY OBSTACLE A SHOWER WAS LACKING IN
THE CASE OF THIS GOOD HUMORED PARTY ALTHOUGH FAVOURITE HAD SAID AS THEY
SET OUT WITH A MAGISTERIAL AND MATERNAL TONE THE SLUGS ARE CRAWLING
IN THE PATHS A SIGN OF RAIN CHILDREN
ALL FOUR WERE MADLY PRETTY
A GOOD OLD CLASSIC POET THEN FAMOUS A GOOD
FELLOW WHO HAD AN ELEONORE M
LE CHEVALIER DE LABOUISSE AS HE STROLLED
THAT DAY BENEATH THE CHESTNUT TREES OF SAINT CLOUD SAW THEM PASS ABOUT
TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND EXCLAIMED THERE IS ONE TOO MANY OF
THEM AS HE THOUGHT OF THE GRACES
FAVOURITE BLACHEVELLE'S FRIEND THE
ONE AGED THREE AND TWENTY THE OLD ONE RAN ON IN FRONT UNDER THE GREAT
GREEN BOUGHS JUMPED THE DITCHES STALKED DISTRACTEDLY OVER BUSHES AND
PRESIDED OVER THIS MERRY MAKING WITH THE SPIRIT OF A YOUNG FEMALE FAUN
ZEPHINE AND DAHLIA WHOM CHANCE HAD MADE BEAUTIFUL IN SUCH A WAY THAT
THEY SET EACH OFF WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER AND COMPLETED EACH OTHER
NEVER LEFT EACH OTHER MORE FROM AN INSTINCT OF COQUETRY THAN FROM
FRIENDSHIP AND CLINGING TO EACH OTHER THEY ASSUMED ENGLISH POSES THE
FIRST KEEPSAKES HAD JUST MADE THEIR APPEARANCE MELANCHOLY WAS DAWNING
FOR WOMEN AS LATER ON BYRONISM DAWNED FOR MEN AND THE HAIR OF THE
TENDER SEX BEGAN TO DROOP DOLEFULLY
ZEPHINE AND DAHLIA HAD THEIR HAIR
DRESSED IN ROLLS
LISTOLIER AND FAMEUIL WHO WERE ENGAGED IN DISCUSSING
THEIR PROFESSORS EXPLAINED TO FANTINE THE DIFFERENCE THAT EXISTED
BETWEEN M
DELVINCOURT AND M
BLONDEAU
BLACHEVELLE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CREATED EXPRESSLY TO CARRY FAVOURITE'S
SINGLE BORDERED IMITATION INDIA SHAWL OF TERNAUX'S MANUFACTURE ON HIS
ARM ON SUNDAYS
THOLOMYES FOLLOWED DOMINATING THE GROUP
HE WAS VERY GAY BUT ONE FELT
THE FORCE OF GOVERNMENT IN HIM THERE WAS DICTATION IN HIS JOVIALITY
HIS PRINCIPAL ORNAMENT WAS A PAIR OF TROUSERS OF ELEPHANT LEG PATTERN OF
NANKEEN WITH STRAPS OF BRAIDED COPPER WIRE HE CARRIED A STOUT RATTAN
WORTH TWO HUNDRED FRANCS IN HIS HAND AND AS HE TREATED HIMSELF TO
EVERYTHING A STRANGE THING CALLED A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH
NOTHING WAS
SACRED TO HIM HE SMOKED
THAT THOLOMYES IS ASTOUNDING SAID THE OTHERS WITH VENERATION
WHAT
TROUSERS WHAT ENERGY
AS FOR FANTINE SHE WAS A JOY TO BEHOLD
HER SPLENDID TEETH HAD
EVIDENTLY RECEIVED AN OFFICE FROM GOD LAUGHTER
SHE PREFERRED TO CARRY
HER LITTLE HAT OF SEWED STRAW WITH ITS LONG WHITE STRINGS IN HER HAND
RATHER THAN ON HER HEAD
HER THICK BLOND HAIR WHICH WAS INCLINED TO
WAVE AND WHICH EASILY UNCOILED AND WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FASTEN
UP INCESSANTLY SEEMED MADE FOR THE FLIGHT OF GALATEA UNDER THE
WILLOWS
HER ROSY LIPS BABBLED ENCHANTINGLY
THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH
VOLUPTUOUSLY TURNED UP AS IN THE ANTIQUE MASKS OF ERIGONE HAD AN
AIR OF ENCOURAGING THE AUDACIOUS BUT HER LONG SHADOWY LASHES DROOPED
DISCREETLY OVER THE JOLLITY OF THE LOWER PART OF THE FACE AS THOUGH TO
CALL A HALT
THERE WAS SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY HARMONIOUS AND STRIKING
ABOUT HER ENTIRE DRESS
SHE WORE A GOWN OF MAUVE BAREGE LITTLE REDDISH
BROWN BUSKINS WHOSE RIBBONS TRACED AN X ON HER FINE WHITE OPEN WORKED
STOCKINGS AND THAT SORT OF MUSLIN SPENCER A MARSEILLES INVENTION
WHOSE NAME CANEZOU A CORRUPTION OF THE WORDS QUINZE AOUT PRONOUNCED
AFTER THE FASHION OF THE CANEBIERE SIGNIFIES FINE WEATHER HEAT AND
MIDDAY
THE THREE OTHERS LESS TIMID AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID
WORE LOW NECKED DRESSES WITHOUT DISGUISE WHICH IN SUMMER BENEATH
FLOWER ADORNED HATS ARE VERY GRACEFUL AND ENTICING BUT BY THE SIDE
OF THESE AUDACIOUS OUTFITS BLOND FANTINE'S CANEZOU WITH ITS
TRANSPARENCIES ITS INDISCRETION AND ITS RETICENCE CONCEALING AND
DISPLAYING AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME SEEMED AN ALLURING GODSEND OF
DECENCY AND THE FAMOUS COURT OF LOVE PRESIDED OVER BY THE VICOMTESSE
DE CETTE WITH THE SEA GREEN EYES WOULD PERHAPS HAVE AWARDED THE
PRIZE FOR COQUETRY TO THIS CANEZOU IN THE CONTEST FOR THE PRIZE OF
MODESTY
THE MOST INGENIOUS IS AT TIMES THE WISEST
THIS DOES HAPPEN
BRILLIANT OF FACE DELICATE OF PROFILE WITH EYES OF A DEEP BLUE HEAVY
LIDS FEET ARCHED AND SMALL WRISTS AND ANKLES ADMIRABLY FORMED A WHITE
SKIN WHICH HERE AND THERE ALLOWED THE AZURE BRANCHING OF THE VEINS TO
BE SEEN JOY A CHEEK THAT WAS YOUNG AND FRESH THE ROBUST THROAT OF THE
JUNO OF AEGINA A STRONG AND SUPPLE NAPE OF THE NECK SHOULDERS MODELLED
AS THOUGH BY COUSTOU WITH A VOLUPTUOUS DIMPLE IN THE MIDDLE VISIBLE
THROUGH THE MUSLIN A GAYETY COOLED BY DREAMINESS SCULPTURAL AND
EXQUISITE SUCH WAS FANTINE AND BENEATH THESE FEMININE ADORNMENTS AND
THESE RIBBONS ONE COULD DIVINE A STATUE AND IN THAT STATUE A SOUL
FANTINE WAS BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT BEING TOO CONSCIOUS OF IT
THOSE RARE
DREAMERS MYSTERIOUS PRIESTS OF THE BEAUTIFUL WHO SILENTLY CONFRONT
EVERYTHING WITH PERFECTION WOULD HAVE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE IN THIS LITTLE
WORKING WOMAN THROUGH THE TRANSPARENCY OF HER PARISIAN GRACE OF THE
ANCIENT SACRED EUPHONY
THIS DAUGHTER OF THE SHADOWS WAS THOROUGHBRED
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL IN THE TWO WAYS STYLE AND RHYTHM
STYLE IS THE FORM
OF THE IDEAL RHYTHM IS ITS MOVEMENT
WE HAVE SAID THAT FANTINE WAS JOY SHE WAS ALSO MODESTY
TO AN OBSERVER WHO STUDIED HER ATTENTIVELY THAT WHICH BREATHED FROM
HER ATHWART ALL THE INTOXICATION OF HER AGE THE SEASON AND HER
LOVE AFFAIR WAS AN INVINCIBLE EXPRESSION OF RESERVE AND MODESTY
SHE
REMAINED A LITTLE ASTONISHED
THIS CHASTE ASTONISHMENT IS THE SHADE
OF DIFFERENCE WHICH SEPARATES PSYCHE FROM VENUS
FANTINE HAD THE LONG
WHITE FINE FINGERS OF THE VESTAL VIRGIN WHO STIRS THE ASHES OF THE
SACRED FIRE WITH A GOLDEN PIN
ALTHOUGH SHE WOULD HAVE REFUSED NOTHING
TO THOLOMYES AS WE SHALL HAVE MORE THAN AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HER
FACE IN REPOSE WAS SUPREMELY VIRGINAL A SORT OF SERIOUS AND ALMOST
AUSTERE DIGNITY SUDDENLY OVERWHELMED HER AT CERTAIN TIMES AND THERE
WAS NOTHING MORE SINGULAR AND DISTURBING THAN TO SEE GAYETY BECOME SO
SUDDENLY EXTINCT THERE AND MEDITATION SUCCEED TO CHEERFULNESS WITHOUT
ANY TRANSITION STATE
THIS SUDDEN AND SOMETIMES SEVERELY ACCENTUATED
GRAVITY RESEMBLED THE DISDAIN OF A GODDESS
HER BROW HER NOSE HER
CHIN PRESENTED THAT EQUILIBRIUM OF OUTLINE WHICH IS QUITE DISTINCT
FROM EQUILIBRIUM OF PROPORTION AND FROM WHICH HARMONY OF COUNTENANCE
RESULTS IN THE VERY CHARACTERISTIC INTERVAL WHICH SEPARATES THE BASE
OF THE NOSE FROM THE UPPER LIP SHE HAD THAT IMPERCEPTIBLE AND CHARMING
FOLD A MYSTERIOUS SIGN OF CHASTITY WHICH MAKES BARBEROUSSE FALL IN
LOVE WITH A DIANA FOUND IN THE TREASURES OF ICONIA
LOVE IS A FAULT SO BE IT
FANTINE WAS INNOCENCE FLOATING HIGH OVER
FAULT
CHAPTER IV THOLOMYES IS SO MERRY THAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTY
THAT DAY WAS COMPOSED OF DAWN FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER
ALL NATURE
SEEMED TO BE HAVING A HOLIDAY AND TO BE LAUGHING
THE FLOWER BEDS OF
SAINT CLOUD PERFUMED THE AIR THE BREATH OF THE SEINE RUSTLED THE
LEAVES VAGUELY THE BRANCHES GESTICULATED IN THE WIND BEES PILLAGED THE
JASMINES A WHOLE BOHEMIA OF BUTTERFLIES SWOOPED DOWN UPON THE YARROW
THE CLOVER AND THE STERILE OATS IN THE AUGUST PARK OF THE KING OF
FRANCE THERE WAS A PACK OF VAGABONDS THE BIRDS
THE FOUR MERRY COUPLES MINGLED WITH THE SUN THE FIELDS THE FLOWERS
THE TREES WERE RESPLENDENT
AND IN THIS COMMUNITY OF PARADISE TALKING SINGING RUNNING DANCING
CHASING BUTTERFLIES PLUCKING CONVOLVULUS WETTING THEIR PINK OPEN WORK
STOCKINGS IN THE TALL GRASS FRESH WILD WITHOUT MALICE ALL RECEIVED
TO SOME EXTENT THE KISSES OF ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FANTINE
WHO WAS HEDGED ABOUT WITH THAT VAGUE RESISTANCE OF HERS COMPOSED OF
DREAMINESS AND WILDNESS AND WHO WAS IN LOVE
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A QUEER
LOOK ABOUT YOU SAID FAVOURITE TO HER
SUCH THINGS ARE JOYS
THESE PASSAGES OF HAPPY COUPLES ARE A PROFOUND
APPEAL TO LIFE AND NATURE AND MAKE A CARESS AND LIGHT SPRING FORTH FROM
EVERYTHING
THERE WAS ONCE A FAIRY WHO CREATED THE FIELDS AND FORESTS
EXPRESSLY FOR THOSE IN LOVE IN THAT ETERNAL HEDGE SCHOOL OF LOVERS
WHICH IS FOREVER BEGINNING ANEW AND WHICH WILL LAST AS LONG AS THERE
ARE HEDGES AND SCHOLARS
HENCE THE POPULARITY OF SPRING AMONG THINKERS
THE PATRICIAN AND THE KNIFE GRINDER THE DUKE AND THE PEER THE LIMB
OF THE LAW THE COURTIERS AND TOWNSPEOPLE AS THEY USED TO SAY IN OLDEN
TIMES ALL ARE SUBJECTS OF THIS FAIRY
THEY LAUGH AND HUNT AND THERE
IS IN THE AIR THE BRILLIANCE OF AN APOTHEOSIS WHAT A TRANSFIGURATION
EFFECTED BY LOVE NOTARIES' CLERKS ARE GODS
AND THE LITTLE CRIES
THE PURSUITS THROUGH THE GRASS THE WAISTS EMBRACED ON THE FLY THOSE
JARGONS WHICH ARE MELODIES THOSE ADORATIONS WHICH BURST FORTH IN THE
MANNER OF PRONOUNCING A SYLLABLE THOSE CHERRIES TORN FROM ONE MOUTH BY
ANOTHER ALL THIS BLAZES FORTH AND TAKES ITS PLACE AMONG THE CELESTIAL
GLORIES
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN WASTE THEMSELVES SWEETLY
THEY THINK THAT THIS
WILL NEVER COME TO AN END
PHILOSOPHERS POETS PAINTERS OBSERVE THESE
ECSTASIES AND KNOW NOT WHAT TO MAKE OF IT SO GREATLY ARE THEY DAZZLED
BY IT
THE DEPARTURE FOR CYTHERA EXCLAIMS WATTEAU LANCRET THE PAINTER
OF PLEBEIANS CONTEMPLATES HIS BOURGEOIS WHO HAVE FLITTED AWAY INTO THE
AZURE SKY DIDEROT STRETCHES OUT HIS ARMS TO ALL THESE LOVE IDYLS AND
D'URFE MINGLES DRUIDS WITH THEM
AFTER BREAKFAST THE FOUR COUPLES WENT TO WHAT WAS THEN CALLED THE KING'S
SQUARE TO SEE A NEWLY ARRIVED PLANT FROM INDIA WHOSE NAME ESCAPES OUR
MEMORY AT THIS MOMENT AND WHICH AT THAT EPOCH WAS ATTRACTING ALL
PARIS TO SAINT CLOUD
IT WAS AN ODD AND CHARMING SHRUB WITH A LONG STEM
WHOSE NUMEROUS BRANCHES BRISTLING AND LEAFLESS AND AS FINE AS THREADS
WERE COVERED WITH A MILLION TINY WHITE ROSETTES THIS GAVE THE SHRUB THE
AIR OF A HEAD OF HAIR STUDDED WITH FLOWERS
THERE WAS ALWAYS AN ADMIRING
CROWD ABOUT IT
AFTER VIEWING THE SHRUB THOLOMYES EXCLAIMED I OFFER YOU ASSES AND
HAVING AGREED UPON A PRICE WITH THE OWNER OF THE ASSES THEY RETURNED
BY WAY OF VANVRES AND ISSY
AT ISSY AN INCIDENT OCCURRED
THE TRULY
NATIONAL PARK AT THAT TIME OWNED BY BOURGUIN THE CONTRACTOR HAPPENED
TO BE WIDE OPEN
THEY PASSED THE GATES VISITED THE MANIKIN ANCHORITE IN
HIS GROTTO TRIED THE MYSTERIOUS LITTLE EFFECTS OF THE FAMOUS CABINET
OF MIRRORS THE WANTON TRAP WORTHY OF A SATYR BECOME A MILLIONAIRE OR OF
TURCARET METAMORPHOSED INTO A PRIAPUS
THEY HAD STOUTLY SHAKEN THE SWING
ATTACHED TO THE TWO CHESTNUT TREES CELEBRATED BY THE ABBE DE BERNIS
AS HE SWUNG THESE BEAUTIES ONE AFTER THE OTHER PRODUCING FOLDS IN THE
FLUTTERING SKIRTS WHICH GREUZE WOULD HAVE FOUND TO HIS TASTE AMID PEALS
OF LAUGHTER THE TOULOUSAN THOLOMYES WHO WAS SOMEWHAT OF A SPANIARD
TOULOUSE BEING THE COUSIN OF TOLOSA SANG TO A MELANCHOLY CHANT THE
OLD BALLAD GALLEGA PROBABLY INSPIRED BY SOME LOVELY MAID DASHING IN
FULL FLIGHT UPON A ROPE BETWEEN TWO TREES
SOY DE BADAJOZ BADAJOZ IS MY HOME
AMOR ME LLAMA AND LOVE IS MY NAME
TODA MI ALMA TO MY EYES IN FLAME
ES EN MI OJOS ALL MY SOUL DOTH COME
PORQUE ENSENAS FOR INSTRUCTION MEET
A TUAS PIERNAS
I RECEIVE AT THY FEET
FANTINE ALONE REFUSED TO SWING
I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE PEOPLE PUT ON AIRS LIKE THAT MUTTERED FAVOURITE
WITH A GOOD DEAL OF ACRIMONY
AFTER LEAVING THE ASSES THERE WAS A FRESH DELIGHT THEY CROSSED THE
SEINE IN A BOAT AND PROCEEDING FROM PASSY ON FOOT THEY REACHED THE
BARRIER OF L'ETOILE
THEY HAD BEEN UP SINCE FIVE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING
AS THE READER WILL REMEMBER BUT BAH THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FATIGUE
ON SUNDAY SAID FAVOURITE ON SUNDAY FATIGUE DOES NOT WORK
ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK THE FOUR COUPLES FRIGHTENED AT THEIR HAPPINESS
WERE SLIDING DOWN THE RUSSIAN MOUNTAINS A SINGULAR EDIFICE WHICH THEN
OCCUPIED THE HEIGHTS OF BEAUJON AND WHOSE UNDULATING LINE WAS VISIBLE
ABOVE THE TREES OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES
FROM TIME TO TIME FAVOURITE EXCLAIMED
AND THE SURPRISE I CLAIM THE SURPRISE
PATIENCE REPLIED THOLOMYES
CHAPTER V AT BOMBARDA'S
THE RUSSIAN MOUNTAINS HAVING BEEN EXHAUSTED THEY BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT
DINNER AND THE RADIANT PARTY OF EIGHT SOMEWHAT WEARY AT LAST BECAME
STRANDED IN BOMBARDA'S PUBLIC HOUSE A BRANCH ESTABLISHMENT WHICH HAD
BEEN SET UP IN THE CHAMPS ELYSEES BY THAT FAMOUS RESTAURANT KEEPER
BOMBARDA WHOSE SIGN COULD THEN BE SEEN IN THE RUE DE RIVOLI NEAR
DELORME ALLEY
A LARGE BUT UGLY ROOM WITH AN ALCOVE AND A BED AT THE END THEY HAD
BEEN OBLIGED TO PUT UP WITH THIS ACCOMMODATION IN VIEW OF THE SUNDAY
CROWD TWO WINDOWS WHENCE THEY COULD SURVEY BEYOND THE ELMS THE QUAY
AND THE RIVER A MAGNIFICENT AUGUST SUNLIGHT LIGHTLY TOUCHING THE PANES
TWO TABLES UPON ONE OF THEM A TRIUMPHANT MOUNTAIN OF BOUQUETS MINGLED
WITH THE HATS OF MEN AND WOMEN AT THE OTHER THE FOUR COUPLES SEATED
ROUND A MERRY CONFUSION OF PLATTERS DISHES GLASSES AND BOTTLES JUGS
OF BEER MINGLED WITH FLASKS OF WINE VERY LITTLE ORDER ON THE TABLE
SOME DISORDER BENEATH IT
THEY MADE BENEATH THE TABLE
A NOISE A CLATTER OF THE FEET THAT WAS ABOMINABLE
SAYS MOLIERE
THIS WAS THE STATE WHICH THE SHEPHERD IDYL BEGUN AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN
THE MORNING HAD REACHED AT HALF PAST FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON
THE SUN WAS
SETTING THEIR APPETITES WERE SATISFIED
THE CHAMPS ELYSEES FILLED WITH SUNSHINE AND WITH PEOPLE WERE NOTHING
BUT LIGHT AND DUST THE TWO THINGS OF WHICH GLORY IS COMPOSED
THE
HORSES OF MARLY THOSE NEIGHING MARBLES WERE PRANCING IN A CLOUD
OF GOLD
CARRIAGES WERE GOING AND COMING
A SQUADRON OF MAGNIFICENT
BODY GUARDS WITH THEIR CLARIONS AT THEIR HEAD WERE DESCENDING THE
AVENUE DE NEUILLY THE WHITE FLAG SHOWING FAINTLY ROSY IN THE SETTING
SUN FLOATED OVER THE DOME OF THE TUILERIES
THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE
WHICH HAD BECOME THE PLACE LOUIS XV
ONCE MORE WAS CHOKED WITH HAPPY
PROMENADERS
MANY WORE THE SILVER FLEUR DE LYS SUSPENDED FROM THE
WHITE WATERED RIBBON WHICH HAD NOT YET WHOLLY DISAPPEARED FROM
BUTTON HOLES IN THE YEAR 1817
HERE AND THERE CHORUSES OF LITTLE GIRLS
THREW TO THE WINDS AMID THE PASSERSBY WHO FORMED INTO CIRCLES AND
APPLAUDED THE THEN CELEBRATED BOURBON AIR WHICH WAS DESTINED TO STRIKE
THE HUNDRED DAYS WITH LIGHTNING AND WHICH HAD FOR ITS REFRAIN
RENDEZ NOUS NOTRE PERE DE GAND
RENDEZ NOUS NOTRE PERE
GIVE US BACK OUR FATHER FROM GHENT
GIVE US BACK OUR FATHER
GROUPS OF DWELLERS IN THE SUBURBS IN SUNDAY ARRAY SOMETIMES EVEN
DECORATED WITH THE FLEUR DE LYS LIKE THE BOURGEOIS SCATTERED OVER THE
LARGE SQUARE AND THE MARIGNY SQUARE WERE PLAYING AT RINGS AND REVOLVING
ON THE WOODEN HORSES OTHERS WERE ENGAGED IN DRINKING SOME JOURNEYMAN
PRINTERS HAD ON PAPER CAPS THEIR LAUGHTER WAS AUDIBLE
EVERY THING
WAS RADIANT
IT WAS A TIME OF UNDISPUTED PEACE AND PROFOUND ROYALIST
SECURITY IT WAS THE EPOCH WHEN A SPECIAL AND PRIVATE REPORT OF CHIEF
OF POLICE ANGELES TO THE KING ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SUBURBS OF PARIS
TERMINATED WITH THESE LINES
TAKING ALL THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION SIRE THERE IS NOTHING TO BE
FEARED FROM THESE PEOPLE
THEY ARE AS HEEDLESS AND AS INDOLENT AS CATS
THE POPULACE IS RESTLESS IN THE PROVINCES IT IS NOT IN PARIS
THESE ARE
VERY PRETTY MEN SIRE
IT WOULD TAKE ALL OF TWO OF THEM TO MAKE ONE
OF YOUR GRENADIERS
THERE IS NOTHING TO BE FEARED ON THE PART OF THE
POPULACE OF PARIS THE CAPITAL
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE STATURE OF
THIS POPULATION SHOULD HAVE DIMINISHED IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS AND
THE POPULACE OF THE SUBURBS IS STILL MORE PUNY THAN AT THE TIME OF THE
REVOLUTION
IT IS NOT DANGEROUS
IN SHORT IT IS AN AMIABLE RABBLE
PREFECTS OF THE POLICE DO NOT DEEM IT POSSIBLE THAT A CAT CAN TRANSFORM
ITSELF INTO A LION THAT DOES HAPPEN HOWEVER AND IN THAT LIES THE
MIRACLE WROUGHT BY THE POPULACE OF PARIS
MOREOVER THE CAT SO DESPISED
BY COUNT ANGLES POSSESSED THE ESTEEM OF THE REPUBLICS OF OLD
IN THEIR
EYES IT WAS LIBERTY INCARNATE AND AS THOUGH TO SERVE AS PENDANT TO
THE MINERVA APTERA OF THE PIRAEUS THERE STOOD ON THE PUBLIC SQUARE IN
CORINTH THE COLOSSAL BRONZE FIGURE OF A CAT
THE INGENUOUS POLICE OF THE
RESTORATION BEHELD THE POPULACE OF PARIS IN TOO ROSE COLORED A LIGHT
IT IS NOT SO MUCH OF AN AMIABLE RABBLE AS IT IS THOUGHT
THE PARISIAN
IS TO THE FRENCHMAN WHAT THE ATHENIAN WAS TO THE GREEK NO ONE SLEEPS
MORE SOUNDLY THAN HE NO ONE IS MORE FRANKLY FRIVOLOUS AND LAZY THAN
HE NO ONE CAN BETTER ASSUME THE AIR OF FORGETFULNESS LET HIM NOT BE
TRUSTED NEVERTHELESS HE IS READY FOR ANY SORT OF COOL DEED BUT WHEN
THERE IS GLORY AT THE END OF IT HE IS WORTHY OF ADMIRATION IN EVERY
SORT OF FURY
GIVE HIM A PIKE HE WILL PRODUCE THE 10TH OF AUGUST GIVE
HIM A GUN YOU WILL HAVE AUSTERLITZ
HE IS NAPOLEON'S STAY AND DANTON'S
RESOURCE
IS IT A QUESTION OF COUNTRY HE ENLISTS IS IT A QUESTION OF
LIBERTY HE TEARS UP THE PAVEMENTS
BEWARE HIS HAIR FILLED WITH WRATH
IS EPIC HIS BLOUSE DRAPES ITSELF LIKE THE FOLDS OF A CHLAMYS
TAKE
CARE HE WILL MAKE OF THE FIRST RUE GRENETAT WHICH COMES TO HAND CAUDINE
FORKS
WHEN THE HOUR STRIKES THIS MAN OF THE FAUBOURGS WILL GROW IN
STATURE THIS LITTLE MAN WILL ARISE AND HIS GAZE WILL BE TERRIBLE AND
HIS BREATH WILL BECOME A TEMPEST AND THERE WILL ISSUE FORTH FROM THAT
SLENDER CHEST ENOUGH WIND TO DISARRANGE THE FOLDS OF THE ALPS
IT IS
THANKS TO THE SUBURBAN MAN OF PARIS THAT THE REVOLUTION MIXED WITH
ARMS CONQUERS EUROPE
HE SINGS IT IS HIS DELIGHT
PROPORTION HIS SONG
TO HIS NATURE AND YOU WILL SEE AS LONG AS HE HAS FOR REFRAIN NOTHING
BUT LA CARMAGNOLE HE ONLY OVERTHROWS LOUIS XVI MAKE HIM SING THE
MARSEILLAISE AND HE WILL FREE THE WORLD
THIS NOTE JOTTED DOWN ON THE MARGIN OF ANGLES' REPORT WE WILL RETURN TO
OUR FOUR COUPLES
THE DINNER AS WE HAVE SAID WAS DRAWING TO ITS CLOSE
CHAPTER VI A CHAPTER IN WHICH THEY ADORE EACH OTHER
CHAT AT TABLE THE CHAT OF LOVE IT IS AS IMPOSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE ONE AS
THE OTHER THE CHAT OF LOVE IS A CLOUD THE CHAT AT TABLE IS SMOKE
FAMEUIL AND DAHLIA WERE HUMMING
THOLOMYES WAS DRINKING
ZEPHINE WAS
LAUGHING FANTINE SMILING LISTOLIER BLOWING A WOODEN TRUMPET WHICH HE
HAD PURCHASED AT SAINT CLOUD
FAVOURITE GAZED TENDERLY AT BLACHEVELLE AND SAID
BLACHEVELLE I ADORE YOU
THIS CALLED FORTH A QUESTION FROM BLACHEVELLE
WHAT WOULD YOU DO FAVOURITE IF I WERE TO CEASE TO LOVE YOU
I CRIED FAVOURITE
AH DO NOT SAY THAT EVEN IN JEST IF YOU WERE
TO CEASE TO LOVE ME I WOULD SPRING AFTER YOU I WOULD SCRATCH YOU
I SHOULD REND YOU I WOULD THROW YOU INTO THE WATER I WOULD HAVE YOU
ARRESTED
BLACHEVELLE SMILED WITH THE VOLUPTUOUS SELF CONCEIT OF A MAN WHO IS
TICKLED IN HIS SELF LOVE
FAVOURITE RESUMED
YES I WOULD SCREAM TO THE POLICE AH I SHOULD NOT RESTRAIN MYSELF
NOT AT ALL RABBLE
BLACHEVELLE THREW HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR IN AN ECSTASY AND CLOSED
BOTH EYES PROUDLY
DAHLIA AS SHE ATE SAID IN A LOW VOICE TO FAVOURITE AMID THE UPROAR
SO YOU REALLY IDOLIZE HIM DEEPLY THAT BLACHEVELLE OF YOURS
I I DETEST HIM REPLIED FAVOURITE IN THE SAME TONE SEIZING HER FORK
AGAIN
HE IS AVARICIOUS
I LOVE THE LITTLE FELLOW OPPOSITE ME IN MY
HOUSE
HE IS VERY NICE THAT YOUNG MAN DO YOU KNOW HIM ONE CAN SEE
THAT HE IS AN ACTOR BY PROFESSION
I LOVE ACTORS
AS SOON AS HE COMES
IN HIS MOTHER SAYS TO HIM 'AH MON DIEU MY PEACE OF MIND IS GONE
THERE HE GOES WITH HIS SHOUTING
BUT MY DEAR YOU ARE SPLITTING MY
HEAD SO HE GOES UP TO RAT RIDDEN GARRETS TO BLACK HOLES AS HIGH AS
HE CAN MOUNT AND THERE HE SETS TO SINGING DECLAIMING HOW DO I KNOW
WHAT SO THAT HE CAN BE HEARD DOWN STAIRS HE EARNS TWENTY SOUS A DAY AT
AN ATTORNEY'S BY PENNING QUIBBLES
HE IS THE SON OF A FORMER PRECENTOR
OF SAINT JACQUES DU HAUT PAS
AH HE IS VERY NICE
HE IDOLIZES ME SO
THAT ONE DAY WHEN HE SAW ME MAKING BATTER FOR SOME PANCAKES HE SAID TO
ME 'MAMSELLE MAKE YOUR GLOVES INTO FRITTERS AND I WILL EAT THEM IT
IS ONLY ARTISTS WHO CAN SAY SUCH THINGS AS THAT
AH HE IS VERY NICE
I AM IN A FAIR WAY TO GO OUT OF MY HEAD OVER THAT LITTLE FELLOW
NEVER
MIND I TELL BLACHEVELLE THAT I ADORE HIM HOW I LIE HEY HOW I DO
LIE
FAVOURITE PAUSED AND THEN WENT ON
I AM SAD YOU SEE DAHLIA
IT HAS DONE NOTHING BUT RAIN ALL SUMMER THE
WIND IRRITATES ME THE WIND DOES NOT ABATE
BLACHEVELLE IS VERY STINGY
THERE ARE HARDLY ANY GREEN PEAS IN THE MARKET ONE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO
EAT
I HAVE THE SPLEEN AS THE ENGLISH SAY BUTTER IS SO DEAR AND THEN
YOU SEE IT IS HORRIBLE HERE WE ARE DINING IN A ROOM WITH A BED IN IT
AND THAT DISGUSTS ME WITH LIFE
CHAPTER VII THE WISDOM OF THOLOMYES
IN THE MEANTIME WHILE SOME SANG THE REST TALKED TOGETHER TUMULTUOUSLY
ALL AT ONCE IT WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT NOISE
THOLOMYES INTERVENED
LET US NOT TALK AT RANDOM NOR TOO FAST HE EXCLAIMED
LET US REFLECT
IF WE WISH TO BE BRILLIANT
TOO MUCH IMPROVISATION EMPTIES THE MIND IN
A STUPID WAY
RUNNING BEER GATHERS NO FROTH
NO HASTE GENTLEMEN
LET US
MINGLE MAJESTY WITH THE FEAST
LET US EAT WITH MEDITATION LET US MAKE
HASTE SLOWLY
LET US NOT HURRY
CONSIDER THE SPRINGTIME IF IT MAKES
HASTE IT IS DONE FOR THAT IS TO SAY IT GETS FROZEN
EXCESS OF ZEAL
RUINS PEACH TREES AND APRICOT TREES
EXCESS OF ZEAL KILLS THE GRACE AND
THE MIRTH OF GOOD DINNERS
NO ZEAL GENTLEMEN GRIMOD DE LA REYNIERE
AGREES WITH TALLEYRAND
A HOLLOW SOUND OF REBELLION RUMBLED THROUGH THE GROUP
LEAVE US IN PEACE THOLOMYES SAID BLACHEVELLE
DOWN WITH THE TYRANT SAID FAMEUIL
BOMBARDA BOMBANCE AND BAMBOCHEL CRIED LISTOLIER
SUNDAY EXISTS RESUMED FAMEUIL
WE ARE SOBER ADDED LISTOLIER
THOLOMYES REMARKED BLACHEVELLE CONTEMPLATE MY CALMNESS MON
CALME
YOU ARE THE MARQUIS OF THAT RETORTED THOLOMYES
THIS MEDIOCRE PLAY UPON WORDS PRODUCED THE EFFECT OF A STONE IN A POOL
THE MARQUIS DE MONTCALM WAS AT THAT TIME A CELEBRATED ROYALIST
ALL THE
FROGS HELD THEIR PEACE
FRIENDS CRIED THOLOMYES WITH THE ACCENT OF A MAN WHO HAD RECOVERED
HIS EMPIRE COME TO YOURSELVES
THIS PUN WHICH HAS FALLEN FROM THE
SKIES MUST NOT BE RECEIVED WITH TOO MUCH STUPOR
EVERYTHING WHICH FALLS
IN THAT WAY IS NOT NECESSARILY WORTHY OF ENTHUSIASM AND RESPECT
THE PUN
IS THE DUNG OF THE MIND WHICH SOARS
THE JEST FALLS NO MATTER WHERE
AND THE MIND AFTER PRODUCING A PIECE OF STUPIDITY PLUNGES INTO THE AZURE
DEPTHS
A WHITISH SPECK FLATTENED AGAINST THE ROCK DOES NOT PREVENT THE
CONDOR FROM SOARING ALOFT
FAR BE IT FROM ME TO INSULT THE PUN I HONOR
IT IN PROPORTION TO ITS MERITS NOTHING MORE
ALL THE MOST AUGUST THE
MOST SUBLIME THE MOST CHARMING OF HUMANITY AND PERHAPS OUTSIDE OF
HUMANITY HAVE MADE PUNS
JESUS CHRIST MADE A PUN ON ST
PETER MOSES ON
ISAAC AESCHYLUS ON POLYNICES CLEOPATRA ON OCTAVIUS
AND OBSERVE THAT
CLEOPATRA'S PUN PRECEDED THE BATTLE OF ACTIUM AND THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR IT NO ONE WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED THE CITY OF TORYNE A GREEK NAME
WHICH SIGNIFIES A LADLE
THAT ONCE CONCEDED I RETURN TO MY EXHORTATION
I REPEAT BROTHERS I REPEAT NO ZEAL NO HUBBUB NO EXCESS EVEN IN
WITTICISMS GAYETY JOLLITIES OR PLAYS ON WORDS
LISTEN TO ME
I HAVE
THE PRUDENCE OF AMPHIARAUS AND THE BALDNESS OF CAESAR
THERE MUST BE A
LIMIT EVEN TO REBUSES
EST MODUS IN REBUS
THERE MUST BE A LIMIT EVEN TO DINNERS
YOU ARE FOND OF APPLE
TURNOVERS LADIES DO NOT INDULGE IN THEM TO EXCESS
EVEN IN THE MATTER
OF TURNOVERS GOOD SENSE AND ART ARE REQUISITE
GLUTTONY CHASTISES THE
GLUTTON GULA PUNIT GULAX
INDIGESTION IS CHARGED BY THE GOOD GOD WITH
PREACHING MORALITY TO STOMACHS
AND REMEMBER THIS EACH ONE OF OUR
PASSIONS EVEN LOVE HAS A STOMACH WHICH MUST NOT BE FILLED TOO FULL
IN
ALL THINGS THE WORD FINIS MUST BE WRITTEN IN GOOD SEASON SELF CONTROL
MUST BE EXERCISED WHEN THE MATTER BECOMES URGENT THE BOLT MUST BE DRAWN
ON APPETITE ONE MUST SET ONE'S OWN FANTASY TO THE VIOLIN AND CARRY
ONE'S SELF TO THE POST
THE SAGE IS THE MAN WHO KNOWS HOW AT A GIVEN
MOMENT TO EFFECT HIS OWN ARREST
HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE IN ME FOR I
HAVE SUCCEEDED TO SOME EXTENT IN MY STUDY OF THE LAW ACCORDING TO
THE VERDICT OF MY EXAMINATIONS FOR I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
QUESTION PUT AND THE QUESTION PENDING FOR I HAVE SUSTAINED A THESIS IN
LATIN UPON THE MANNER IN WHICH TORTURE WAS ADMINISTERED AT ROME AT THE
EPOCH WHEN MUNATIUS DEMENS WAS QUAESTOR OF THE PARRICIDE BECAUSE I
AM GOING TO BE A DOCTOR APPARENTLY IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT IT IS
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD BE AN IMBECILE
I RECOMMEND YOU TO
MODERATION IN YOUR DESIRES
IT IS TRUE THAT MY NAME IS FELIX THOLOMYES
I SPEAK WELL
HAPPY IS HE WHO WHEN THE HOUR STRIKES TAKES A HEROIC
RESOLVE AND ABDICATES LIKE SYLLA OR ORIGENES
FAVOURITE LISTENED WITH PROFOUND ATTENTION
FELIX SAID SHE WHAT A PRETTY WORD I LOVE THAT NAME
IT IS LATIN

THOLOMYES WENT ON
QUIRITES GENTLEMEN CABALLEROS MY FRIENDS
DO YOU WISH NEVER TO FEEL
THE PRICK TO DO WITHOUT THE NUPTIAL BED AND TO BRAVE LOVE NOTHING
MORE SIMPLE
HERE IS THE RECEIPT LEMONADE EXCESSIVE EXERCISE HARD
LABOR WORK YOURSELF TO DEATH DRAG BLOCKS SLEEP NOT HOLD VIGIL
GORGE YOURSELF WITH NITROUS BEVERAGES AND POTIONS OF NYMPHAEAS DRINK
EMULSIONS OF POPPIES AND AGNUS CASTUS SEASON THIS WITH A STRICT DIET
STARVE YOURSELF AND ADD THERETO COLD BATHS GIRDLES OF HERBS THE
APPLICATION OF A PLATE OF LEAD LOTIONS MADE WITH THE SUBACETATE OF
LEAD AND FOMENTATIONS OF OXYCRAT
I PREFER A WOMAN SAID LISTOLIER
WOMAN RESUMED THOLOMYES DISTRUST HER
WOE TO HIM WHO YIELDS HIMSELF
TO THE UNSTABLE HEART OF WOMAN WOMAN IS PERFIDIOUS AND DISINGENUOUS
SHE DETESTS THE SERPENT FROM PROFESSIONAL JEALOUSY
THE SERPENT IS THE
SHOP OVER THE WAY
THOLOMYES CRIED BLACHEVELLE YOU ARE DRUNK
PARDIEU SAID THOLOMYES
THEN BE GAY RESUMED BLACHEVELLE
I AGREE TO THAT RESPONDED THOLOMYES
AND REFILLING HIS GLASS HE ROSE
GLORY TO WINE NUNC TE BACCHE CANAM PARDON ME LADIES THAT IS
SPANISH

THE ARROBE OF CASTILE CONTAINS SIXTEEN LITRES THE CANTARO OF ALICANTE

BALEARIC ISLES TWENTY SIX THE BOOT OF TZAR PETER THIRTY
LONG
LIVE THAT TZAR WHO WAS GREAT AND LONG LIVE HIS BOOT WHICH WAS STILL
GREATER LADIES TAKE THE ADVICE OF A FRIEND MAKE A MISTAKE IN YOUR
NEIGHBOR IF YOU SEE FIT
THE PROPERTY OF LOVE IS TO ERR

SERVING MAID WHO HAS CALLOUSES ON HER KNEES FROM SCRUBBING
IT IS NOT
MADE FOR THAT IT ERRS GAYLY OUR GENTLE LOVE
IT HAS BEEN SAID ERROR
IS HUMAN I SAY ERROR IS LOVE
LADIES I IDOLIZE YOU ALL
O ZEPHINE O
JOSEPHINE FACE MORE THAN IRREGULAR YOU WOULD BE CHARMING WERE YOU NOT
ALL ASKEW
YOU HAVE THE AIR OF A PRETTY FACE UPON WHICH SOME ONE HAS
SAT DOWN BY MISTAKE
AS FOR FAVOURITE O NYMPHS AND MUSES ONE DAY
WHEN BLACHEVELLE WAS CROSSING THE GUTTER IN THE RUE GUERIN BOISSEAU
HE ESPIED A BEAUTIFUL GIRL WITH WHITE STOCKINGS WELL DRAWN UP WHICH
DISPLAYED HER LEGS
THIS PROLOGUE PLEASED HIM AND BLACHEVELLE FELL
IN LOVE
THE ONE HE LOVED WAS FAVOURITE
O FAVOURITE THOU HAST IONIAN
LIPS
THERE WAS A GREEK PAINTER NAMED EUPHORION WHO WAS SURNAMED THE
PAINTER OF THE LIPS
THAT GREEK ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY TO PAINT
THY MOUTH
LISTEN BEFORE THEE THERE WAS NEVER A CREATURE WORTHY OF THE
NAME
THOU WERT MADE TO RECEIVE THE APPLE LIKE VENUS OR TO EAT IT LIKE
EVE BEAUTY BEGINS WITH THEE
I HAVE JUST REFERRED TO EVE IT IS THOU
WHO HAST CREATED HER
THOU DESERVEST THE LETTERS PATENT OF THE BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN
O FAVOURITE I CEASE TO ADDRESS YOU AS 'THOU BECAUSE I PASS
FROM POETRY TO PROSE

THAT TOUCHED ME BUT LET US WHOEVER WE MAY BE DISTRUST NAMES
THEY MAY
DELUDE US
I AM CALLED FELIX AND I AM NOT HAPPY
WORDS ARE LIARS

IT WOULD BE
A MISTAKE TO WRITE TO LIEGE 2 FOR CORKS AND TO PAU FOR GLOVES
MISS
DAHLIA WERE I IN YOUR PLACE I WOULD CALL MYSELF ROSA
A FLOWER SHOULD
SMELL SWEET AND WOMAN SHOULD HAVE WIT
I SAY NOTHING OF FANTINE SHE
IS A DREAMER A MUSING THOUGHTFUL PENSIVE PERSON SHE IS A PHANTOM
POSSESSED OF THE FORM OF A NYMPH AND THE MODESTY OF A NUN WHO HAS
STRAYED INTO THE LIFE OF A GRISETTE BUT WHO TAKES REFUGE IN ILLUSIONS
AND WHO SINGS AND PRAYS AND GAZES INTO THE AZURE WITHOUT VERY WELL
KNOWING WHAT SHE SEES OR WHAT SHE IS DOING AND WHO WITH HER EYES FIXED
ON HEAVEN WANDERS IN A GARDEN WHERE THERE ARE MORE BIRDS THAN ARE IN
EXISTENCE
O FANTINE KNOW THIS I THOLOMYES I AM ALL ILLUSION BUT
SHE DOES NOT EVEN HEAR ME THAT BLOND MAID OF CHIMERAS AS FOR THE REST
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER IS FRESHNESS SUAVITY YOUTH SWEET MORNING LIGHT
O FANTINE MAID WORTHY OF BEING CALLED MARGUERITE OR PEARL YOU ARE A
WOMAN FROM THE BEAUTEOUS ORIENT
LADIES A SECOND PIECE OF ADVICE DO
NOT MARRY MARRIAGE IS A GRAFT IT TAKES WELL OR ILL AVOID THAT RISK
BUT BAH WHAT AM I SAYING I AM WASTING MY WORDS
GIRLS ARE INCURABLE
ON THE SUBJECT OF MARRIAGE AND ALL THAT WE WISE MEN CAN SAY WILL NOT
PREVENT THE WAISTCOAT MAKERS AND THE SHOE STITCHERS FROM DREAMING
OF HUSBANDS STUDDED WITH DIAMONDS
WELL SO BE IT BUT MY BEAUTIES
REMEMBER THIS YOU EAT TOO MUCH SUGAR
YOU HAVE BUT ONE FAULT O WOMAN
AND THAT IS NIBBLING SUGAR
O NIBBLING SEX YOUR PRETTY LITTLE WHITE
TEETH ADORE SUGAR
NOW HEED ME WELL SUGAR IS A SALT

AT THE SAME MOMENT BLACHEVELLE SUPPORTED BY LISTOLIER AND FAMEUIL
STRUCK UP TO A PLAINTIVE AIR ONE OF THOSE STUDIO SONGS COMPOSED OF
THE FIRST WORDS WHICH COME TO HAND RHYMED RICHLY AND NOT AT ALL AS
DESTITUTE OF SENSE AS THE GESTURE OF THE TREE AND THE SOUND OF THE WIND
WHICH HAVE THEIR BIRTH IN THE VAPOR OF PIPES AND ARE DISSIPATED AND
TAKE THEIR FLIGHT WITH THEM

REPLIED TO THOLOMYES' HARANGUE
THE FATHER TURKEY COCKS SO GRAVE
SOME MONEY TO AN AGENT GAVE
THAT MASTER GOOD CLERMONT TONNERRE
MIGHT BE MADE POPE ON SAINT JOHNS' DAY FAIR
BUT THIS GOOD CLERMONT COULD NOT BE
MADE POPE BECAUSE NO PRIEST WAS HE

WITH ALL THEIR MONEY BACK RETURNED
THIS WAS NOT CALCULATED TO CALM THOLOMYES' IMPROVISATION HE EMPTIED HIS
GLASS FILLED REFILLED IT AND BEGAN AGAIN

DO YOU
KNOW WHAT ASPASIA WAS LADIES ALTHOUGH SHE LIVED AT AN EPOCH WHEN WOMEN
HAD AS YET NO SOUL SHE WAS A SOUL A SOUL OF A ROSY AND PURPLE
HUE MORE ARDENT HUED THAN FIRE FRESHER THAN THE DAWN
ASPASIA WAS
A CREATURE IN WHOM TWO EXTREMES OF WOMANHOOD MET SHE WAS THE GODDESS
PROSTITUTE SOCRATES PLUS MANON LESCAUT
ASPASIA WAS CREATED IN CASE A
MISTRESS SHOULD BE NEEDED FOR PROMETHEUS
THOLOMYES ONCE STARTED WOULD HAVE FOUND SOME DIFFICULTY IN STOPPING
HAD NOT A HORSE FALLEN DOWN UPON THE QUAY JUST AT THAT MOMENT
THE
SHOCK CAUSED THE CART AND THE ORATOR TO COME TO A DEAD HALT
IT WAS A
BEAUCERON MARE OLD AND THIN AND ONE FIT FOR THE KNACKER WHICH WAS
DRAGGING A VERY HEAVY CART
ON ARRIVING IN FRONT OF BOMBARDA'S THE
WORN OUT EXHAUSTED BEAST HAD REFUSED TO PROCEED ANY FURTHER
THIS
INCIDENT ATTRACTED A CROWD
HARDLY HAD THE CURSING AND INDIGNANT CARTER
HAD TIME TO UTTER WITH PROPER ENERGY THE SACRAMENTAL WORD MATIN THE
JADE BACKED UP WITH A PITILESS CUT OF THE WHIP WHEN THE JADE FELL
NEVER TO RISE AGAIN
ON HEARING THE HUBBUB MADE BY THE PASSERSBY
THOLOMYES' MERRY AUDITORS TURNED THEIR HEADS AND THOLOMYES TOOK

POOR HORSE SIGHED FANTINE
AND DAHLIA EXCLAIMED
THERE IS FANTINE ON THE POINT OF CRYING OVER HORSES
HOW CAN ONE BE
SUCH A PITIFUL FOOL AS THAT
AT THAT MOMENT FAVOURITE FOLDING HER ARMS AND THROWING HER HEAD BACK
LOOKED RESOLUTELY AT THOLOMYES AND SAID
COME NOW THE SURPRISE
EXACTLY
THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED REPLIED THOLOMYES
GENTLEMEN
THE HOUR FOR GIVING THESE LADIES A SURPRISE HAS STRUCK

ON THE BROW ADDED THOLOMYES
EACH GRAVELY BESTOWED A KISS ON HIS MISTRESS'S BROW THEN ALL FOUR FILED
OUT THROUGH THE DOOR WITH THEIR FINGERS ON THEIR LIPS
FAVOURITE CLAPPED HER HANDS ON THEIR DEPARTURE
IT IS BEGINNING TO BE AMUSING ALREADY SAID SHE
DON'T BE TOO LONG MURMURED FANTINE WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU
CHAPTER IX A MERRY END TO MIRTH
WHEN THE YOUNG GIRLS WERE LEFT ALONE THEY LEANED TWO BY TWO ON THE
WINDOW SILLS CHATTING CRANING OUT THEIR HEADS AND TALKING FROM ONE
WINDOW TO THE OTHER
THEY SAW THE YOUNG MEN EMERGE FROM THE CAFE BOMBARDA ARM IN ARM
THE
LATTER TURNED ROUND MADE SIGNS TO THEM SMILED AND DISAPPEARED IN
THAT DUSTY SUNDAY THRONG WHICH MAKES A WEEKLY INVASION INTO THE
CHAMPS ELYSEES
DON'T BE LONG CRIED FANTINE
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO BRING US SAID ZEPHINE
IT WILL CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING PRETTY SAID DAHLIA
FOR MY PART SAID FAVOURITE I WANT IT TO BE OF GOLD
THEIR ATTENTION WAS SOON DISTRACTED BY THE MOVEMENTS ON THE SHORE OF THE
LAKE WHICH THEY COULD SEE THROUGH THE BRANCHES OF THE LARGE TREES AND
WHICH DIVERTED THEM GREATLY
IT WAS THE HOUR FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THE MAIL COACHES AND DILIGENCES
NEARLY ALL THE STAGE COACHES FOR THE SOUTH AND WEST PASSED THROUGH THE
CHAMPS ELYSEES
THE MAJORITY FOLLOWED THE QUAY AND WENT THROUGH THE
PASSY BARRIER
FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT SOME HUGE VEHICLE PAINTED YELLOW
AND BLACK HEAVILY LOADED NOISILY HARNESSED RENDERED SHAPELESS
BY TRUNKS TARPAULINS AND VALISES FULL OF HEADS WHICH IMMEDIATELY
DISAPPEARED RUSHED THROUGH THE CROWD WITH ALL THE SPARKS OF A FORGE
WITH DUST FOR SMOKE AND AN AIR OF FURY GRINDING THE PAVEMENTS
CHANGING ALL THE PAVING STONES INTO STEELS
THIS UPROAR DELIGHTED THE
YOUNG GIRLS
FAVOURITE EXCLAIMED
WHAT A ROW ONE WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS A PILE OF CHAINS FLYING AWAY
IT CHANCED THAT ONE OF THESE VEHICLES WHICH THEY COULD ONLY SEE WITH
DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE THICK ELMS HALTED FOR A MOMENT THEN SET OUT
AGAIN AT A GALLOP
THIS SURPRISED FANTINE
THAT'S ODD SAID SHE
I THOUGHT THE DILIGENCE NEVER STOPPED
FAVOURITE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
THIS FANTINE IS SURPRISING
I AM COMING TO TAKE A LOOK AT HER OUT OF
CURIOSITY
SHE IS DAZZLED BY THE SIMPLEST THINGS
SUPPOSE A CASE I AM
A TRAVELLER I SAY TO THE DILIGENCE 'I WILL GO ON IN ADVANCE YOU SHALL

THE WAITER REPLIED
IT IS A PAPER THAT THOSE GENTLEMEN LEFT FOR THESE LADIES

BOOK FOURTH TO CONFIDE IS SOMETIMES TO DELIVER INTO A PERSON'S POWER
CHAPTER I ONE MOTHER MEETS ANOTHER MOTHER
THERE WAS AT MONTFERMEIL NEAR PARIS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS
CENTURY A SORT OF COOK SHOP WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS
THIS COOK SHOP WAS
KEPT BY SOME PEOPLE NAMED THENARDIER HUSBAND AND WIFE
IT WAS SITUATED
IN BOULANGER LANE
OVER THE DOOR THERE WAS A BOARD NAILED FLAT AGAINST
THE WALL
UPON THIS BOARD WAS PAINTED SOMETHING WHICH RESEMBLED A
MAN CARRYING ANOTHER MAN ON HIS BACK THE LATTER WEARING THE BIG GILT
EPAULETTES OF A GENERAL WITH LARGE SILVER STARS RED SPOTS REPRESENTED
BLOOD THE REST OF THE PICTURE CONSISTED OF SMOKE AND PROBABLY
REPRESENTED A BATTLE
BELOW RAN THIS INSCRIPTION AT THE SIGN OF
SERGEANT OF WATERLOO AU SARGENT DE WATERLOO
NOTHING IS MORE COMMON THAN A CART OR A TRUCK AT THE DOOR OF A HOSTELRY
NEVERTHELESS THE VEHICLE OR TO SPEAK MORE ACCURATELY THE FRAGMENT OF
A VEHICLE WHICH ENCUMBERED THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE COOK SHOP OF THE
SERGEANT OF WATERLOO ONE EVENING IN THE SPRING OF 1818 WOULD CERTAINLY
HAVE ATTRACTED BY ITS MASS THE ATTENTION OF ANY PAINTER WHO HAD PASSED
THAT WAY
IT WAS THE FORE CARRIAGE OF ONE OF THOSE TRUCKS WHICH ARE USED IN WOODED
TRACTS OF COUNTRY AND WHICH SERVE TO TRANSPORT THICK PLANKS AND THE
TRUNKS OF TREES
THIS FORE CARRIAGE WAS COMPOSED OF A MASSIVE IRON
AXLE TREE WITH A PIVOT INTO WHICH WAS FITTED A HEAVY SHAFT AND
WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO HUGE WHEELS
THE WHOLE THING WAS COMPACT
OVERWHELMING AND MISSHAPEN
IT SEEMED LIKE THE GUN CARRIAGE OF AN
ENORMOUS CANNON
THE RUTS OF THE ROAD HAD BESTOWED ON THE WHEELS THE
FELLIES THE HUB THE AXLE AND THE SHAFT A LAYER OF MUD A HIDEOUS
YELLOWISH DAUBING HUE TOLERABLY LIKE THAT WITH WHICH PEOPLE ARE FOND
OF ORNAMENTING CATHEDRALS
THE WOOD WAS DISAPPEARING UNDER MUD AND THE
IRON BENEATH RUST
UNDER THE AXLE TREE HUNG LIKE DRAPERY A HUGE CHAIN
WORTHY OF SOME GOLIATH OF A CONVICT
THIS CHAIN SUGGESTED NOT THE
BEAMS WHICH IT WAS ITS OFFICE TO TRANSPORT BUT THE MASTODONS AND
MAMMOTHS WHICH IT MIGHT HAVE SERVED TO HARNESS IT HAD THE AIR OF THE
GALLEYS BUT OF CYCLOPEAN AND SUPERHUMAN GALLEYS AND IT SEEMED TO HAVE
BEEN DETACHED FROM SOME MONSTER
HOMER WOULD HAVE BOUND POLYPHEMUS WITH
IT AND SHAKESPEARE CALIBAN
WHY WAS THAT FORE CARRIAGE OF A TRUCK IN THAT PLACE IN THE STREET IN
THE FIRST PLACE TO ENCUMBER THE STREET NEXT IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT
FINISH THE PROCESS OF RUSTING
THERE IS A THRONG OF INSTITUTIONS IN THE
OLD SOCIAL ORDER WHICH ONE COMES ACROSS IN THIS FASHION AS ONE WALKS
ABOUT OUTDOORS AND WHICH HAVE NO OTHER REASONS FOR EXISTENCE THAN THE
ABOVE
THE CENTRE OF THE CHAIN SWUNG VERY NEAR THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE AND IN
THE LOOP AS IN THE ROPE OF A SWING THERE WERE SEATED AND GROUPED ON
THAT PARTICULAR EVENING IN EXQUISITE INTERLACEMENT TWO LITTLE GIRLS
ONE ABOUT TWO YEARS AND A HALF OLD THE OTHER EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE
YOUNGER IN THE ARMS OF THE OTHER
A HANDKERCHIEF CLEVERLY KNOTTED ABOUT
THEM PREVENTED THEIR FALLING OUT
A MOTHER HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THAT
FRIGHTFUL CHAIN AND HAD SAID COME THERE'S A PLAYTHING FOR MY
CHILDREN
THE TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE DRESSED PRETTILY AND WITH SOME ELEGANCE WERE
RADIANT WITH PLEASURE ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THEY WERE TWO ROSES AMID
OLD IRON THEIR EYES WERE A TRIUMPH THEIR FRESH CHEEKS WERE FULL OF
LAUGHTER
ONE HAD CHESTNUT HAIR THE OTHER BROWN
THEIR INNOCENT FACES
WERE TWO DELIGHTED SURPRISES A BLOSSOMING SHRUB WHICH GREW NEAR WAFTED
TO THE PASSERS BY PERFUMES WHICH SEEMED TO EMANATE FROM THEM THE CHILD
OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS DISPLAYED HER PRETTY LITTLE BARE STOMACH WITH THE
CHASTE INDECENCY OF CHILDHOOD
ABOVE AND AROUND THESE TWO DELICATE
HEADS ALL MADE OF HAPPINESS AND STEEPED IN LIGHT THE GIGANTIC
FORE CARRIAGE BLACK WITH RUST ALMOST TERRIBLE ALL ENTANGLED IN CURVES
AND WILD ANGLES ROSE IN A VAULT LIKE THE ENTRANCE OF A CAVERN
A FEW
PACES APART CROUCHING DOWN UPON THE THRESHOLD OF THE HOSTELRY THE
MOTHER NOT A VERY PREPOSSESSING WOMAN BY THE WAY THOUGH TOUCHING
AT THAT MOMENT WAS SWINGING THE TWO CHILDREN BY MEANS OF A LONG CORD
WATCHING THEM CAREFULLY FOR FEAR OF ACCIDENTS WITH THAT ANIMAL AND
CELESTIAL EXPRESSION WHICH IS PECULIAR TO MATERNITY
AT EVERY BACKWARD
AND FORWARD SWING THE HIDEOUS LINKS EMITTED A STRIDENT SOUND WHICH
RESEMBLED A CRY OF RAGE THE LITTLE GIRLS WERE IN ECSTASIES THE SETTING
SUN MINGLED IN THIS JOY AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CHARMING THAN THIS
CAPRICE OF CHANCE WHICH HAD MADE OF A CHAIN OF TITANS THE SWING OF
CHERUBIM
AS SHE ROCKED HER LITTLE ONES THE MOTHER HUMMED IN A DISCORDANT VOICE A
ROMANCE THEN CELEBRATED
IT MUST BE SAID A WARRIOR
HER SONG AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF HER DAUGHTERS PREVENTED HER HEARING
AND SEEING WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE STREET
IN THE MEANTIME SOME ONE HAD APPROACHED HER AS SHE WAS BEGINNING THE
FIRST COUPLET OF THE ROMANCE AND SUDDENLY SHE HEARD A VOICE SAYING VERY
NEAR HER EAR
YOU HAVE TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN THERE MADAME
TO THE FAIR AND TENDER IMOGENE
REPLIED THE MOTHER CONTINUING HER ROMANCE THEN SHE TURNED HER HEAD
A WOMAN STOOD BEFORE HER A FEW PACES DISTANT
THIS WOMAN ALSO HAD A
CHILD WHICH SHE CARRIED IN HER ARMS
SHE WAS CARRYING IN ADDITION A LARGE CARPET BAG WHICH SEEMED VERY
HEAVY
THIS WOMAN'S CHILD WAS ONE OF THE MOST DIVINE CREATURES THAT IT IS
POSSIBLE TO BEHOLD
IT WAS A GIRL TWO OR THREE YEARS OF AGE
SHE COULD
HAVE ENTERED INTO COMPETITION WITH THE TWO OTHER LITTLE ONES SO FAR AS
THE COQUETRY OF HER DRESS WAS CONCERNED SHE WORE A CAP OF FINE LINEN
RIBBONS ON HER BODICE AND VALENCIENNES LACE ON HER CAP
THE FOLDS OF
HER SKIRT WERE RAISED SO AS TO PERMIT A VIEW OF HER WHITE FIRM AND
DIMPLED LEG
SHE WAS ADMIRABLY ROSY AND HEALTHY
THE LITTLE BEAUTY
INSPIRED A DESIRE TO TAKE A BITE FROM THE APPLES OF HER CHEEKS
OF HER
EYES NOTHING COULD BE KNOWN EXCEPT THAT THEY MUST BE VERY LARGE AND
THAT THEY HAD MAGNIFICENT LASHES
SHE WAS ASLEEP
SHE SLEPT WITH THAT SLUMBER OF ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE PECULIAR TO HER
AGE
THE ARMS OF MOTHERS ARE MADE OF TENDERNESS IN THEM CHILDREN SLEEP
PROFOUNDLY
AS FOR THE MOTHER HER APPEARANCE WAS SAD AND POVERTY STRICKEN
SHE
WAS DRESSED LIKE A WORKING WOMAN WHO IS INCLINED TO TURN INTO A PEASANT
AGAIN
SHE WAS YOUNG
WAS SHE HANDSOME PERHAPS BUT IN THAT ATTIRE IT
WAS NOT APPARENT
HER HAIR A GOLDEN LOCK OF WHICH HAD ESCAPED SEEMED
VERY THICK BUT WAS SEVERELY CONCEALED BENEATH AN UGLY TIGHT CLOSE
NUN LIKE CAP TIED UNDER THE CHIN
A SMILE DISPLAYS BEAUTIFUL TEETH WHEN
ONE HAS THEM BUT SHE DID NOT SMILE
HER EYES DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN
DRY FOR A VERY LONG TIME
SHE WAS PALE SHE HAD A VERY WEARY AND RATHER
SICKLY APPEARANCE
SHE GAZED UPON HER DAUGHTER ASLEEP IN HER ARMS WITH
THE AIR PECULIAR TO A MOTHER WHO HAS NURSED HER OWN CHILD
A LARGE BLUE
HANDKERCHIEF SUCH AS THE INVALIDES USE WAS FOLDED INTO A FICHU AND
CONCEALED HER FIGURE CLUMSILY
HER HANDS WERE SUNBURNT AND ALL DOTTED
WITH FRECKLES HER FOREFINGER WAS HARDENED AND LACERATED WITH THE
NEEDLE SHE WORE A CLOAK OF COARSE BROWN WOOLLEN STUFF A LINEN GOWN
AND COARSE SHOES
IT WAS FANTINE
IT WAS FANTINE BUT DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE
NEVERTHELESS ON
SCRUTINIZING HER ATTENTIVELY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE STILL RETAINED
HER BEAUTY
A MELANCHOLY FOLD WHICH RESEMBLED THE BEGINNING OF IRONY
WRINKLED HER RIGHT CHEEK
AS FOR HER TOILETTE THAT AERIAL TOILETTE OF
MUSLIN AND RIBBONS WHICH SEEMED MADE OF MIRTH OF FOLLY AND OF MUSIC
FULL OF BELLS AND PERFUMED WITH LILACS HAD VANISHED LIKE THAT BEAUTIFUL
AND DAZZLING HOAR FROST WHICH IS MISTAKEN FOR DIAMONDS IN THE SUNLIGHT
IT MELTS AND LEAVES THE BRANCH QUITE BLACK
TEN MONTHS HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE PRETTY FARCE
WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING THOSE TEN MONTHS IT CAN BE DIVINED
AFTER ABANDONMENT STRAIGHTENED CIRCUMSTANCES
FANTINE HAD IMMEDIATELY
LOST SIGHT OF FAVOURITE ZEPHINE AND DAHLIA THE BOND ONCE BROKEN ON THE
SIDE OF THE MEN IT WAS LOOSED BETWEEN THE WOMEN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN
GREATLY ASTONISHED HAD ANY ONE TOLD THEM A FORTNIGHT LATER THAT THEY
HAD BEEN FRIENDS THERE NO LONGER EXISTED ANY REASON FOR SUCH A THING
FANTINE HAD REMAINED ALONE
THE FATHER OF HER CHILD GONE ALAS SUCH
RUPTURES ARE IRREVOCABLE SHE FOUND HERSELF ABSOLUTELY ISOLATED MINUS
THE HABIT OF WORK AND PLUS THE TASTE FOR PLEASURE
DRAWN AWAY BY HER
LIAISON WITH THOLOMYES TO DISDAIN THE PRETTY TRADE WHICH SHE KNEW SHE
HAD NEGLECTED TO KEEP HER MARKET OPEN IT WAS NOW CLOSED TO HER
SHE HAD
NO RESOURCE
FANTINE BARELY KNEW HOW TO READ AND DID NOT KNOW HOW TO
WRITE IN HER CHILDHOOD SHE HAD ONLY BEEN TAUGHT TO SIGN HER NAME
SHE HAD A PUBLIC LETTER WRITER INDITE AN EPISTLE TO THOLOMYES THEN A
SECOND THEN A THIRD
THOLOMYES REPLIED TO NONE OF THEM
FANTINE HEARD
THE GOSSIPS SAY AS THEY LOOKED AT HER CHILD WHO TAKES THOSE CHILDREN
SERIOUSLY ONE ONLY SHRUGS ONE'S SHOULDERS OVER SUCH CHILDREN THEN SHE
THOUGHT OF THOLOMYES WHO HAD SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS OVER HIS CHILD
AND WHO DID NOT TAKE THAT INNOCENT BEING SERIOUSLY AND HER HEART GREW
GLOOMY TOWARD THAT MAN
BUT WHAT WAS SHE TO DO SHE NO LONGER KNEW TO
WHOM TO APPLY
SHE HAD COMMITTED A FAULT BUT THE FOUNDATION OF HER
NATURE AS WILL BE REMEMBERED WAS MODESTY AND VIRTUE
SHE WAS VAGUELY
CONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS ON THE VERGE OF FALLING INTO DISTRESS AND OF
GLIDING INTO A WORSE STATE
COURAGE WAS NECESSARY SHE POSSESSED IT AND
HELD HERSELF FIRM
THE IDEA OF RETURNING TO HER NATIVE TOWN OF M
SUR
M
OCCURRED TO HER
THERE SOME ONE MIGHT POSSIBLY KNOW HER AND GIVE HER
WORK YES BUT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CONCEAL HER FAULT
IN A CONFUSED
WAY SHE PERCEIVED THE NECESSITY OF A SEPARATION WHICH WOULD BE MORE
PAINFUL THAN THE FIRST ONE
HER HEART CONTRACTED BUT SHE TOOK HER
RESOLUTION
FANTINE AS WE SHALL SEE HAD THE FIERCE BRAVERY OF LIFE
SHE HAD ALREADY VALIANTLY RENOUNCED FINERY HAD DRESSED HERSELF IN
LINEN AND HAD PUT ALL HER SILKS ALL HER ORNAMENTS ALL HER RIBBONS
AND ALL HER LACES ON HER DAUGHTER THE ONLY VANITY WHICH WAS LEFT TO
HER AND A HOLY ONE IT WAS
SHE SOLD ALL THAT SHE HAD WHICH PRODUCED
FOR HER TWO HUNDRED FRANCS HER LITTLE DEBTS PAID SHE HAD ONLY ABOUT
EIGHTY FRANCS LEFT
AT THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO ON A BEAUTIFUL SPRING
MORNING SHE QUITTED PARIS BEARING HER CHILD ON HER BACK
ANY ONE WHO
HAD SEEN THESE TWO PASS WOULD HAVE HAD PITY ON THEM
THIS WOMAN HAD
IN ALL THE WORLD NOTHING BUT HER CHILD AND THE CHILD HAD IN ALL THE
WORLD NO ONE BUT THIS WOMAN
FANTINE HAD NURSED HER CHILD AND THIS HAD
TIRED HER CHEST AND SHE COUGHED A LITTLE
WE SHALL HAVE NO FURTHER OCCASION TO SPEAK OF M
FELIX THOLOMYES
LET US
CONFINE OURSELVES TO SAYING THAT TWENTY YEARS LATER UNDER KING LOUIS
PHILIPPE HE WAS A GREAT PROVINCIAL LAWYER WEALTHY AND INFLUENTIAL A
WISE ELECTOR AND A VERY SEVERE JURYMAN HE WAS STILL A MAN OF PLEASURE
TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AFTER HAVING FROM TIME TO TIME FOR THE
SAKE OF RESTING HERSELF TRAVELLED FOR THREE OR FOUR SOUS A LEAGUE IN
WHAT WAS THEN KNOWN AS THE PETITES VOITURES DES ENVIRONS DE PARIS THE
LITTLE SUBURBAN COACH SERVICE FANTINE FOUND HERSELF AT MONTFERMEIL
IN THE ALLEY BOULANGER
AS SHE PASSED THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS BLISSFUL
IN THE MONSTER SWING HAD DAZZLED HER IN A MANNER AND SHE HAD HALTED IN
FRONT OF THAT VISION OF JOY
CHARMS EXIST
THESE TWO LITTLE GIRLS WERE A CHARM TO THIS MOTHER
SHE GAZED AT THEM IN MUCH EMOTION
THE PRESENCE OF ANGELS IS AN
ANNOUNCEMENT OF PARADISE
SHE THOUGHT THAT ABOVE THIS INN SHE BEHELD
THE MYSTERIOUS HERE OF PROVIDENCE
THESE TWO LITTLE CREATURES WERE
EVIDENTLY HAPPY
SHE GAZED AT THEM SHE ADMIRED THEM IN SUCH EMOTION
THAT AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEIR MOTHER WAS RECOVERING HER BREATH BETWEEN
TWO COUPLETS OF HER SONG SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ADDRESSING TO HER
THE REMARK WHICH WE HAVE JUST READ
YOU HAVE TWO PRETTY CHILDREN MADAME
THE MOST FEROCIOUS CREATURES ARE DISARMED BY CARESSES BESTOWED ON THEIR
YOUNG
THE MOTHER RAISED HER HEAD AND THANKED HER AND BADE THE WAYFARER
SIT DOWN ON THE BENCH AT THE DOOR SHE HERSELF BEING SEATED ON THE
THRESHOLD
THE TWO WOMEN BEGAN TO CHAT
MY NAME IS MADAME THENARDIER SAID THE MOTHER OF THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS
WE KEEP THIS INN
THEN HER MIND STILL RUNNING ON HER ROMANCE SHE RESUMED HUMMING BETWEEN
HER TEETH
IT MUST BE SO I AM A KNIGHT
AND I AM OFF TO PALESTINE
THIS MADAME THENARDIER WAS A SANDY COMPLEXIONED WOMAN THIN AND
ANGULAR THE TYPE OF THE SOLDIER'S WIFE IN ALL ITS UNPLEASANTNESS AND
WHAT WAS ODD WITH A LANGUISHING AIR WHICH SHE OWED TO HER PERUSAL
OF ROMANCES
SHE WAS A SIMPERING BUT MASCULINE CREATURE
OLD ROMANCES
PRODUCE THAT EFFECT WHEN RUBBED AGAINST THE IMAGINATION OF COOK SHOP
WOMAN
SHE WAS STILL YOUNG SHE WAS BARELY THIRTY
IF THIS CROUCHING
WOMAN HAD STOOD UPRIGHT HER LOFTY STATURE AND HER FRAME OF A
PERAMBULATING COLOSSUS SUITABLE FOR FAIRS MIGHT HAVE FRIGHTENED THE
TRAVELLER AT THE OUTSET TROUBLED HER CONFIDENCE AND DISTURBED WHAT
CAUSED WHAT WE HAVE TO RELATE TO VANISH
A PERSON WHO IS SEATED INSTEAD
OF STANDING ERECT DESTINIES HANG UPON SUCH A THING AS THAT
THE TRAVELLER TOLD HER STORY WITH SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS
THAT SHE WAS A WORKING WOMAN THAT HER HUSBAND WAS DEAD THAT HER
WORK IN PARIS HAD FAILED HER AND THAT SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO SEEK IT
ELSEWHERE IN HER OWN NATIVE PARTS THAT SHE HAD LEFT PARIS THAT MORNING
ON FOOT THAT AS SHE WAS CARRYING HER CHILD AND FELT FATIGUED SHE HAD
GOT INTO THE VILLEMOMBLE COACH WHEN SHE MET IT THAT FROM VILLEMOMBLE
SHE HAD COME TO MONTFERMEIL ON FOOT THAT THE LITTLE ONE HAD WALKED A
LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH BECAUSE SHE WAS SO YOUNG AND THAT SHE HAD BEEN
OBLIGED TO TAKE HER UP AND THE JEWEL HAD FALLEN ASLEEP
AT THIS WORD SHE BESTOWED ON HER DAUGHTER A PASSIONATE KISS WHICH WOKE
HER
THE CHILD OPENED HER EYES GREAT BLUE EYES LIKE HER MOTHER'S AND
LOOKED AT WHAT NOTHING WITH THAT SERIOUS AND SOMETIMES SEVERE AIR OF
LITTLE CHILDREN WHICH IS A MYSTERY OF THEIR LUMINOUS INNOCENCE IN
THE PRESENCE OF OUR TWILIGHT OF VIRTUE
ONE WOULD SAY THAT THEY FEEL
THEMSELVES TO BE ANGELS AND THAT THEY KNOW US TO BE MEN
THEN THE CHILD
BEGAN TO LAUGH AND ALTHOUGH THE MOTHER HELD FAST TO HER SHE SLIPPED TO
THE GROUND WITH THE UNCONQUERABLE ENERGY OF A LITTLE BEING WHICH WISHED
TO RUN
ALL AT ONCE SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TWO OTHERS IN THE SWING
STOPPED SHORT AND PUT OUT HER TONGUE IN SIGN OF ADMIRATION
MOTHER THENARDIER RELEASED HER DAUGHTERS MADE THEM DESCEND FROM THE
SWING AND SAID
NOW AMUSE YOURSELVES ALL THREE OF YOU
CHILDREN BECOME ACQUAINTED QUICKLY AT THAT AGE AND AT THE EXPIRATION
OF A MINUTE THE LITTLE THENARDIERS WERE PLAYING WITH THE NEW COMER AT
MAKING HOLES IN THE GROUND WHICH WAS AN IMMENSE PLEASURE
THE NEW COMER WAS VERY GAY THE GOODNESS OF THE MOTHER IS WRITTEN IN THE
GAYETY OF THE CHILD SHE HAD SEIZED A SCRAP OF WOOD WHICH SERVED HER
FOR A SHOVEL AND ENERGETICALLY DUG A CAVITY BIG ENOUGH FOR A FLY
THE
GRAVE DIGGER'S BUSINESS BECOMES A SUBJECT FOR LAUGHTER WHEN PERFORMED BY
A CHILD
THE TWO WOMEN PURSUED THEIR CHAT
WHAT IS YOUR LITTLE ONE'S NAME
COSETTE
FOR COSETTE READ EUPHRASIE
THE CHILD'S NAME WAS EUPHRASIE
BUT OUT
OF EUPHRASIE THE MOTHER HAD MADE COSETTE BY THAT SWEET AND GRACEFUL
INSTINCT OF MOTHERS AND OF THE POPULACE WHICH CHANGES JOSEPHA INTO
PEPITA AND FRANCOISE INTO SILLETTE
IT IS A SORT OF DERIVATIVE WHICH
DISARRANGES AND DISCONCERTS THE WHOLE SCIENCE OF ETYMOLOGISTS
WE HAVE
KNOWN A GRANDMOTHER WHO SUCCEEDED IN TURNING THEODORE INTO GNON
HOW OLD IS SHE
SHE IS GOING ON THREE
THAT IS THE AGE OF MY ELDEST
IN THE MEANTIME THE THREE LITTLE GIRLS WERE GROUPED IN AN ATTITUDE OF
PROFOUND ANXIETY AND BLISSFULNESS AN EVENT HAD HAPPENED A BIG WORM
HAD EMERGED FROM THE GROUND AND THEY WERE AFRAID AND THEY WERE IN
ECSTASIES OVER IT
THEIR RADIANT BROWS TOUCHED EACH OTHER ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THERE
WERE THREE HEADS IN ONE AUREOLE
HOW EASILY CHILDREN GET ACQUAINTED AT ONCE EXCLAIMED MOTHER
THENARDIER ONE WOULD SWEAR THAT THEY WERE THREE SISTERS
THIS REMARK WAS PROBABLY THE SPARK WHICH THE OTHER MOTHER HAD BEEN
WAITING FOR
SHE SEIZED THE THENARDIER'S HAND LOOKED AT HER FIXEDLY
AND SAID
WILL YOU KEEP MY CHILD FOR ME
THE THENARDIER MADE ONE OF THOSE MOVEMENTS OF SURPRISE WHICH SIGNIFY
NEITHER ASSENT NOR REFUSAL
COSETTE'S MOTHER CONTINUED
YOU SEE I CANNOT TAKE MY DAUGHTER TO THE COUNTRY
MY WORK WILL NOT
PERMIT IT
WITH A CHILD ONE CAN FIND NO SITUATION
PEOPLE ARE RIDICULOUS
IN THE COUNTRY
IT WAS THE GOOD GOD WHO CAUSED ME TO PASS YOUR INN
WHEN
I CAUGHT SIGHT OF YOUR LITTLE ONES SO PRETTY SO CLEAN AND SO HAPPY
IT OVERWHELMED ME
I SAID 'HERE IS A GOOD MOTHER
THAT IS JUST THE
THING THAT WILL MAKE THREE SISTERS AND THEN IT WILL NOT BE LONG
BEFORE I RETURN
WILL YOU KEEP MY CHILD FOR ME
I MUST SEE ABOUT IT REPLIED THE THENARDIER
I WILL GIVE YOU SIX FRANCS A MONTH
HERE A MAN'S VOICE CALLED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE COOK SHOP
NOT FOR LESS THAN SEVEN FRANCS
AND SIX MONTHS PAID IN ADVANCE
SIX TIMES SEVEN MAKES FORTY TWO SAID THE THENARDIER
I WILL GIVE IT SAID THE MOTHER
AND FIFTEEN FRANCS IN ADDITION FOR PRELIMINARY EXPENSES ADDED THE
MAN'S VOICE
TOTAL FIFTY SEVEN FRANCS SAID MADAME THENARDIER
AND SHE HUMMED
VAGUELY WITH THESE FIGURES
IT MUST BE SAID A WARRIOR
I WILL PAY IT SAID THE MOTHER
I HAVE EIGHTY FRANCS
I SHALL HAVE
ENOUGH LEFT TO REACH THE COUNTRY BY TRAVELLING ON FOOT
I SHALL
EARN MONEY THERE AND AS SOON AS I HAVE A LITTLE I WILL RETURN FOR MY
DARLING
THE MAN'S VOICE RESUMED
THE LITTLE ONE HAS AN OUTFIT
THAT IS MY HUSBAND SAID THE THENARDIER
OF COURSE SHE HAS AN OUTFIT THE POOR TREASURE I UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY
THAT IT WAS YOUR HUSBAND AND A BEAUTIFUL OUTFIT TOO A SENSELESS
OUTFIT EVERYTHING BY THE DOZEN AND SILK GOWNS LIKE A LADY
IT IS HERE
IN MY CARPET BAG
YOU MUST HAND IT OVER STRUCK IN THE MAN'S VOICE AGAIN
OF COURSE I SHALL GIVE IT TO YOU SAID THE MOTHER
IT WOULD BE VERY
QUEER IF I WERE TO LEAVE MY DAUGHTER QUITE NAKED
THE MASTER'S FACE APPEARED
THAT'S GOOD SAID HE
THE BARGAIN WAS CONCLUDED
THE MOTHER PASSED THE NIGHT AT THE INN GAVE
UP HER MONEY AND LEFT HER CHILD FASTENED HER CARPET BAG ONCE MORE NOW
REDUCED IN VOLUME BY THE REMOVAL OF THE OUTFIT AND LIGHT HENCEFORTH
AND SET OUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING INTENDING TO RETURN SOON
PEOPLE
ARRANGE SUCH DEPARTURES TRANQUILLY BUT THEY ARE DESPAIRS
A NEIGHBOR OF THE THENARDIERS MET THIS MOTHER AS SHE WAS SETTING OUT
AND CAME BACK WITH THE REMARK
I HAVE JUST SEEN A WOMAN CRYING IN THE STREET SO THAT IT WAS ENOUGH TO
REND YOUR HEART
WHEN COSETTE'S MOTHER HAD TAKEN HER DEPARTURE THE MAN SAID TO THE
WOMAN
THAT WILL SERVE TO PAY MY NOTE FOR ONE HUNDRED AND TEN FRANCS WHICH
FALLS DUE TO MORROW I LACKED FIFTY FRANCS
DO YOU KNOW THAT I SHOULD
HAVE HAD A BAILIFF AND A PROTEST AFTER ME YOU PLAYED THE MOUSE TRAP
NICELY WITH YOUR YOUNG ONES
WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT SAID THE WOMAN
CHAPTER II FIRST SKETCH OF TWO UNPREPOSSESSING FIGURES
THE MOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN CAUGHT WAS A PITIFUL SPECIMEN BUT THE CAT
REJOICES EVEN OVER A LEAN MOUSE
WHO WERE THESE THENARDIERS
LET US SAY A WORD OR TWO OF THEM NOW
WE WILL COMPLETE THE SKETCH LATER
ON
THESE BEINGS BELONGED TO THAT BASTARD CLASS COMPOSED OF COARSE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DESCENDED
IN THE SCALE WHICH IS BETWEEN THE CLASS CALLED MIDDLE AND THE CLASS
DENOMINATED AS INFERIOR AND WHICH COMBINES SOME OF THE DEFECTS OF THE
SECOND WITH NEARLY ALL THE VICES OF THE FIRST WITHOUT POSSESSING
THE GENEROUS IMPULSE OF THE WORKINGMAN NOR THE HONEST ORDER OF THE
BOURGEOIS
THEY WERE OF THOSE DWARFED NATURES WHICH IF A DULL FIRE CHANCES TO WARM
THEM UP EASILY BECOME MONSTROUS
THERE WAS IN THE WOMAN A SUBSTRATUM
OF THE BRUTE AND IN THE MAN THE MATERIAL FOR A BLACKGUARD
BOTH WERE
SUSCEPTIBLE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF THE SORT OF HIDEOUS PROGRESS
WHICH IS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE DIRECTION OF EVIL
THERE EXIST CRAB LIKE
SOULS WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY RETREATING TOWARDS THE DARKNESS
RETROGRADING IN LIFE RATHER THAN ADVANCING EMPLOYING EXPERIENCE TO
AUGMENT THEIR DEFORMITY GROWING INCESSANTLY WORSE AND BECOMING MORE
AND MORE IMPREGNATED WITH AN EVER AUGMENTING BLACKNESS
THIS MAN AND
WOMAN POSSESSED SUCH SOULS
THENARDIER IN PARTICULAR WAS TROUBLESOME FOR A PHYSIOGNOMIST
ONE CAN
ONLY LOOK AT SOME MEN TO DISTRUST THEM FOR ONE FEELS THAT THEY ARE
DARK IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
THEY ARE UNEASY IN THE REAR AND THREATENING
IN FRONT
THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE UNKNOWN ABOUT THEM
ONE CAN NO MORE
ANSWER FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE THAN FOR WHAT THEY WILL DO
THE SHADOW
WHICH THEY BEAR IN THEIR GLANCE DENOUNCES THEM
FROM MERELY HEARING THEM
UTTER A WORD OR SEEING THEM MAKE A GESTURE ONE OBTAINS A GLIMPSE OF
SOMBRE SECRETS IN THEIR PAST AND OF SOMBRE MYSTERIES IN THEIR FUTURE
THIS THENARDIER IF HE HIMSELF WAS TO BE BELIEVED HAD BEEN A SOLDIER A
SERGEANT HE SAID
HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN OF 1815
AND HAD EVEN CONDUCTED HIMSELF WITH TOLERABLE VALOR IT WOULD SEEM
WE
SHALL SEE LATER ON HOW MUCH TRUTH THERE WAS IN THIS
THE SIGN OF HIS
HOSTELRY WAS IN ALLUSION TO ONE OF HIS FEATS OF ARMS
HE HAD PAINTED IT
HIMSELF FOR HE KNEW HOW TO DO A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING AND BADLY
IT WAS AT THE EPOCH WHEN THE ANCIENT CLASSICAL ROMANCE WHICH AFTER
HAVING BEEN CLELIE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT LODOISKA STILL NOBLE
BUT EVER MORE AND MORE VULGAR HAVING FALLEN FROM MADEMOISELLE DE
SCUDERI TO MADAME BOURNON MALARME AND FROM MADAME DE LAFAYETTE TO
MADAME BARTHELEMY HADOT WAS SETTING THE LOVING HEARTS OF THE PORTRESSES
OF PARIS AFLAME AND EVEN RAVAGING THE SUBURBS TO SOME EXTENT
MADAME
THENARDIER WAS JUST INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO READ THIS SORT OF BOOKS
SHE
LIVED ON THEM
IN THEM SHE DROWNED WHAT BRAINS SHE POSSESSED
THIS HAD
GIVEN HER WHEN VERY YOUNG AND EVEN A LITTLE LATER A SORT OF PENSIVE
ATTITUDE TOWARDS HER HUSBAND A SCAMP OF A CERTAIN DEPTH A RUFFIAN
LETTERED TO THE EXTENT OF THE GRAMMAR COARSE AND FINE AT ONE AND THE
SAME TIME BUT SO FAR AS SENTIMENTALISM WAS CONCERNED GIVEN TO THE
PERUSAL OF PIGAULT LEBRUN AND IN WHAT CONCERNS THE SEX AS HE SAID
IN HIS JARGON A DOWNRIGHT UNMITIGATED LOUT
HIS WIFE WAS TWELVE OR
FIFTEEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN HE WAS
LATER ON WHEN HER HAIR ARRANGED IN
A ROMANTICALLY DROOPING FASHION BEGAN TO GROW GRAY WHEN THE MAGAERA
BEGAN TO BE DEVELOPED FROM THE PAMELA THE FEMALE THENARDIER WAS NOTHING
BUT A COARSE VICIOUS WOMAN WHO HAD DABBLED IN STUPID ROMANCES
NOW
ONE CANNOT READ NONSENSE WITH IMPUNITY
THE RESULT WAS THAT HER ELDEST
DAUGHTER WAS NAMED EPONINE AS FOR THE YOUNGER THE POOR LITTLE THING
CAME NEAR BEING CALLED GULNARE I KNOW NOT TO WHAT DIVERSION EFFECTED
BY A ROMANCE OF DUCRAY DUMENIL SHE OWED THE FACT THAT SHE MERELY BORE
THE NAME OF AZELMA
HOWEVER WE WILL REMARK BY THE WAY EVERYTHING WAS NOT RIDICULOUS AND
SUPERFICIAL IN THAT CURIOUS EPOCH TO WHICH WE ARE ALLUDING AND WHICH
MAY BE DESIGNATED AS THE ANARCHY OF BAPTISMAL NAMES
BY THE SIDE OF
THIS ROMANTIC ELEMENT WHICH WE HAVE JUST INDICATED THERE IS THE SOCIAL
SYMPTOM
IT IS NOT RARE FOR THE NEATHERD'S BOY NOWADAYS TO BEAR THE NAME
OF ARTHUR ALFRED OR ALPHONSE AND FOR THE VICOMTE IF THERE ARE
STILL ANY VICOMTES TO BE CALLED THOMAS PIERRE OR JACQUES
THIS
DISPLACEMENT WHICH PLACES THE ELEGANT NAME ON THE PLEBEIAN AND THE
RUSTIC NAME ON THE ARISTOCRAT IS NOTHING ELSE THAN AN EDDY OF EQUALITY
THE IRRESISTIBLE PENETRATION OF THE NEW INSPIRATION IS THERE AS
EVERYWHERE ELSE
BENEATH THIS APPARENT DISCORD THERE IS A GREAT AND A
PROFOUND THING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
CHAPTER III THE LARK
IT IS NOT ALL IN ALL SUFFICIENT TO BE WICKED IN ORDER TO PROSPER
THE
COOK SHOP WAS IN A BAD WAY
THANKS TO THE TRAVELLER'S FIFTY SEVEN FRANCS THENARDIER HAD BEEN ABLE
TO AVOID A PROTEST AND TO HONOR HIS SIGNATURE
ON THE FOLLOWING MONTH
THEY WERE AGAIN IN NEED OF MONEY
THE WOMAN TOOK COSETTE'S OUTFIT TO
PARIS AND PAWNED IT AT THE PAWNBROKER'S FOR SIXTY FRANCS
AS SOON
AS THAT SUM WAS SPENT THE THENARDIERS GREW ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK ON THE
LITTLE GIRL MERELY AS A CHILD WHOM THEY WERE CARING FOR OUT OF CHARITY
AND THEY TREATED HER ACCORDINGLY
AS SHE HAD NO LONGER ANY CLOTHES THEY
DRESSED HER IN THE CAST OFF PETTICOATS AND CHEMISES OF THE THENARDIER
BRATS THAT IS TO SAY IN RAGS
THEY FED HER ON WHAT ALL THE REST
HAD LEFT A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE DOG A LITTLE WORSE THAN THE CAT
MOREOVER THE CAT AND THE DOG WERE HER HABITUAL TABLE COMPANIONS
COSETTE ATE WITH THEM UNDER THE TABLE FROM A WOODEN BOWL SIMILAR TO
THEIRS
THE MOTHER WHO HAD ESTABLISHED HERSELF AS WE SHALL SEE LATER ON AT M
SUR M WROTE OR MORE CORRECTLY CAUSED TO BE WRITTEN A LETTER EVERY
MONTH THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE NEWS OF HER CHILD
THE THENARDIERS REPLIED
INVARIABLY COSETTE IS DOING WONDERFULLY WELL
AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE FIRST SIX MONTHS THE MOTHER SENT SEVEN FRANCS
FOR THE SEVENTH MONTH AND CONTINUED HER REMITTANCES WITH TOLERABLE
REGULARITY FROM MONTH TO MONTH
THE YEAR WAS NOT COMPLETED WHEN
THENARDIER SAID A FINE FAVOR SHE IS DOING US IN SOOTH WHAT DOES SHE
EXPECT US TO DO WITH HER SEVEN FRANCS AND HE WROTE TO DEMAND TWELVE
FRANCS
THE MOTHER WHOM THEY HAD PERSUADED INTO THE BELIEF THAT HER
CHILD WAS HAPPY AND WAS COMING ON WELL SUBMITTED AND FORWARDED THE
TWELVE FRANCS
CERTAIN NATURES CANNOT LOVE ON THE ONE HAND WITHOUT HATING ON THE OTHER
MOTHER THENARDIER LOVED HER TWO DAUGHTERS PASSIONATELY WHICH CAUSED HER
TO HATE THE STRANGER
IT IS SAD TO THINK THAT THE LOVE OF A MOTHER CAN POSSESS VILLAINOUS
ASPECTS
LITTLE AS WAS THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY COSETTE IT SEEMED TO
HER AS THOUGH IT WERE TAKEN FROM HER OWN AND THAT THAT LITTLE CHILD
DIMINISHED THE AIR WHICH HER DAUGHTERS BREATHED
THIS WOMAN LIKE MANY
WOMEN OF HER SORT HAD A LOAD OF CARESSES AND A BURDEN OF BLOWS AND
INJURIES TO DISPENSE EACH DAY
IF SHE HAD NOT HAD COSETTE IT IS CERTAIN
THAT HER DAUGHTERS IDOLIZED AS THEY WERE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED THE WHOLE
OF IT BUT THE STRANGER DID THEM THE SERVICE TO DIVERT THE BLOWS TO
HERSELF
HER DAUGHTERS RECEIVED NOTHING BUT CARESSES
COSETTE COULD NOT
MAKE A MOTION WHICH DID NOT DRAW DOWN UPON HER HEAD A HEAVY SHOWER OF
VIOLENT BLOWS AND UNMERITED CHASTISEMENT
THE SWEET FEEBLE BEING WHO
SHOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING OF THIS WORLD OR OF GOD INCESSANTLY
PUNISHED SCOLDED ILL USED BEATEN AND SEEING BESIDE HER TWO LITTLE
CREATURES LIKE HERSELF WHO LIVED IN A RAY OF DAWN
MADAME THENARDIER WAS VICIOUS WITH COSETTE
EPONINE AND AZELMA WERE
VICIOUS
CHILDREN AT THAT AGE ARE ONLY COPIES OF THEIR MOTHER
THE SIZE
IS SMALLER THAT IS ALL
A YEAR PASSED THEN ANOTHER
PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE SAID
THOSE THENARDIERS ARE GOOD PEOPLE
THEY ARE NOT RICH AND YET THEY ARE
BRINGING UP A POOR CHILD WHO WAS ABANDONED ON THEIR HANDS
THEY THOUGHT THAT COSETTE'S MOTHER HAD FORGOTTEN HER
IN THE MEANWHILE THENARDIER HAVING LEARNED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY BY
WHAT OBSCURE MEANS THAT THE CHILD WAS PROBABLY A BASTARD AND THAT THE
MOTHER COULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IT EXACTED FIFTEEN FRANCS A MONTH SAYING
THAT THE CREATURE WAS GROWING AND EATING AND THREATENING TO SEND
HER AWAY
LET HER NOT BOTHER ME HE EXCLAIMED OR I'LL FIRE HER BRAT
RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF HER SECRETS
I MUST HAVE AN INCREASE THE
MOTHER PAID THE FIFTEEN FRANCS
FROM YEAR TO YEAR THE CHILD GREW AND SO DID HER WRETCHEDNESS
AS LONG AS COSETTE WAS LITTLE SHE WAS THE SCAPE GOAT OF THE TWO OTHER
CHILDREN AS SOON AS SHE BEGAN TO DEVELOP A LITTLE THAT IS TO SAY
BEFORE SHE WAS EVEN FIVE YEARS OLD SHE BECAME THE SERVANT OF THE
HOUSEHOLD
FIVE YEARS OLD THE READER WILL SAY THAT IS NOT PROBABLE
ALAS IT IS
TRUE
SOCIAL SUFFERING BEGINS AT ALL AGES
HAVE WE NOT RECENTLY SEEN THE
TRIAL OF A MAN NAMED DUMOLLARD AN ORPHAN TURNED BANDIT WHO FROM THE
AGE OF FIVE AS THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS STATE BEING ALONE IN THE WORLD
WORKED FOR HIS LIVING AND STOLE
COSETTE WAS MADE TO RUN ON ERRANDS TO SWEEP THE ROOMS THE COURTYARD
THE STREET TO WASH THE DISHES TO EVEN CARRY BURDENS
THE THENARDIERS
CONSIDERED THEMSELVES ALL THE MORE AUTHORIZED TO BEHAVE IN THIS MANNER
SINCE THE MOTHER WHO WAS STILL AT M
SUR M HAD BECOME IRREGULAR IN
HER PAYMENTS
SOME MONTHS SHE WAS IN ARREARS
IF THIS MOTHER HAD RETURNED TO MONTFERMEIL AT THE END OF THESE THREE
YEARS SHE WOULD NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED HER CHILD
COSETTE SO PRETTY AND
ROSY ON HER ARRIVAL IN THAT HOUSE WAS NOW THIN AND PALE
SHE HAD AN
INDESCRIBABLY UNEASY LOOK
THE SLY CREATURE SAID THE THENARDIERS
INJUSTICE HAD MADE HER PEEVISH AND MISERY HAD MADE HER UGLY
NOTHING
REMAINED TO HER EXCEPT HER BEAUTIFUL EYES WHICH INSPIRED PAIN BECAUSE
LARGE AS THEY WERE IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ONE BEHELD IN THEM A STILL
LARGER AMOUNT OF SADNESS
IT WAS A HEART BREAKING THING TO SEE THIS POOR CHILD NOT YET SIX YEARS
OLD SHIVERING IN THE WINTER IN HER OLD RAGS OF LINEN FULL OF HOLES
SWEEPING THE STREET BEFORE DAYLIGHT WITH AN ENORMOUS BROOM IN HER TINY
RED HANDS AND A TEAR IN HER GREAT EYES
ILLUSTRATION COSSETTE SWEEPING 1B4 1 COSSETTE SWEEPING
SHE WAS CALLED THE LARK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THE POPULACE WHO ARE FOND
OF THESE FIGURES OF SPEECH HAD TAKEN A FANCY TO BESTOW THIS NAME ON
THIS TREMBLING FRIGHTENED AND SHIVERING LITTLE CREATURE NO BIGGER
THAN A BIRD WHO WAS AWAKE EVERY MORNING BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE IN THE
HOUSE OR THE VILLAGE AND WAS ALWAYS IN THE STREET OR THE FIELDS BEFORE
DAYBREAK
ONLY THE LITTLE LARK NEVER SANG
BOOK FIFTH THE DESCENT
CHAPTER I THE HISTORY OF A PROGRESS IN BLACK GLASS TRINKETS
AND IN THE MEANTIME WHAT HAD BECOME OF THAT MOTHER WHO ACCORDING TO
THE PEOPLE AT MONTFERMEIL SEEMED TO HAVE ABANDONED HER CHILD WHERE WAS
SHE WHAT WAS SHE DOING
AFTER LEAVING HER LITTLE COSETTE WITH THE THENARDIERS SHE HAD CONTINUED
HER JOURNEY AND HAD REACHED M
SUR M
THIS IT WILL BE REMEMBERED WAS IN 1818
FANTINE HAD QUITTED HER PROVINCE TEN YEARS BEFORE
M
SUR M
HAD CHANGED
ITS ASPECT
WHILE FANTINE HAD BEEN SLOWLY DESCENDING FROM WRETCHEDNESS
TO WRETCHEDNESS HER NATIVE TOWN HAD PROSPERED
ABOUT TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY ONE OF THOSE INDUSTRIAL FACTS WHICH ARE THE
GRAND EVENTS OF SMALL DISTRICTS HAD TAKEN PLACE
THIS DETAIL IS IMPORTANT AND WE REGARD IT AS USEFUL TO DEVELOP IT AT
LENGTH WE SHOULD ALMOST SAY TO UNDERLINE IT
FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL M
SUR M
HAD HAD FOR ITS SPECIAL INDUSTRY THE
IMITATION OF ENGLISH JET AND THE BLACK GLASS TRINKETS OF GERMANY
THIS
INDUSTRY HAD ALWAYS VEGETATED ON ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH PRICE OF THE RAW
MATERIAL WHICH REACTED ON THE MANUFACTURE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN FANTINE
RETURNED TO M
SUR M AN UNHEARD OF TRANSFORMATION HAD TAKEN PLACE
IN THE PRODUCTION OF BLACK GOODS TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF 1815 A MAN
A STRANGER HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN THE TOWN AND HAD BEEN INSPIRED
WITH THE IDEA OF SUBSTITUTING IN THIS MANUFACTURE GUM LAC FOR RESIN
AND FOR BRACELETS IN PARTICULAR SLIDES OF SHEET IRON SIMPLY LAID
TOGETHER FOR SLIDES OF SOLDERED SHEET IRON
THIS VERY SMALL CHANGE HAD EFFECTED A REVOLUTION
THIS VERY SMALL CHANGE HAD IN FACT PRODIGIOUSLY REDUCED THE COST OF
THE RAW MATERIAL WHICH HAD RENDERED IT POSSIBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE TO
RAISE THE PRICE OF MANUFACTURE A BENEFIT TO THE COUNTRY IN THE SECOND
PLACE TO IMPROVE THE WORKMANSHIP AN ADVANTAGE TO THE CONSUMER IN THE
THIRD PLACE TO SELL AT A LOWER PRICE WHILE TREBLING THE PROFIT WHICH
WAS A BENEFIT TO THE MANUFACTURER
THUS THREE RESULTS ENSUED FROM ONE IDEA
IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS THE INVENTOR OF THIS PROCESS HAD BECOME RICH
WHICH IS GOOD AND HAD MADE EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM RICH WHICH IS BETTER
HE WAS A STRANGER IN THE DEPARTMENT
OF HIS ORIGIN NOTHING WAS KNOWN
OF THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER VERY LITTLE
IT WAS RUMORED THAT HE HAD
COME TO TOWN WITH VERY LITTLE MONEY A FEW HUNDRED FRANCS AT THE MOST
IT WAS FROM THIS SLENDER CAPITAL ENLISTED IN THE SERVICE OF AN
INGENIOUS IDEA DEVELOPED BY METHOD AND THOUGHT THAT HE HAD DRAWN HIS
OWN FORTUNE AND THE FORTUNE OF THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE
ON HIS ARRIVAL AT M
SUR M
HE HAD ONLY THE GARMENTS THE APPEARANCE
AND THE LANGUAGE OF A WORKINGMAN
IT APPEARS THAT ON THE VERY DAY WHEN HE MADE HIS OBSCURE ENTRY INTO
THE LITTLE TOWN OF M
SUR M JUST AT NIGHTFALL ON A DECEMBER EVENING
KNAPSACK ON BACK AND THORN CLUB IN HAND A LARGE FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT
IN THE TOWN HALL
THIS MAN HAD RUSHED INTO THE FLAMES AND SAVED AT THE
RISK OF HIS OWN LIFE TWO CHILDREN WHO BELONGED TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE
GENDARMERIE THIS IS WHY THEY HAD FORGOTTEN TO ASK HIM FOR HIS PASSPORT
AFTERWARDS THEY HAD LEARNED HIS NAME
HE WAS CALLED FATHER MADELEINE
CHAPTER II MADELEINE
HE WAS A MAN ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE WHO HAD A PREOCCUPIED AIR AND
WHO WAS GOOD
THAT WAS ALL THAT COULD BE SAID ABOUT HIM
THANKS TO THE RAPID PROGRESS OF THE INDUSTRY WHICH HE HAD SO ADMIRABLY
RE CONSTRUCTED M
SUR M
HAD BECOME A RATHER IMPORTANT CENTRE OF TRADE
SPAIN WHICH CONSUMES A GOOD DEAL OF BLACK JET MADE ENORMOUS PURCHASES
THERE EACH YEAR
M
SUR M
ALMOST RIVALLED LONDON AND BERLIN IN THIS
BRANCH OF COMMERCE
FATHER MADELEINE'S PROFITS WERE SUCH THAT AT THE
END OF THE SECOND YEAR HE WAS ABLE TO ERECT A LARGE FACTORY IN WHICH
THERE WERE TWO VAST WORKROOMS ONE FOR THE MEN AND THE OTHER FOR WOMEN
ANY ONE WHO WAS HUNGRY COULD PRESENT HIMSELF THERE AND WAS SURE OF
FINDING EMPLOYMENT AND BREAD
FATHER MADELEINE REQUIRED OF THE MEN GOOD
WILL OF THE WOMEN PURE MORALS AND OF ALL PROBITY
HE HAD SEPARATED
THE WORK ROOMS IN ORDER TO SEPARATE THE SEXES AND SO THAT THE WOMEN AND
GIRLS MIGHT REMAIN DISCREET
ON THIS POINT HE WAS INFLEXIBLE
IT WAS THE
ONLY THING IN WHICH HE WAS IN A MANNER INTOLERANT
HE WAS ALL THE MORE
FIRMLY SET ON THIS SEVERITY SINCE M
SUR M BEING A GARRISON TOWN
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CORRUPTION ABOUNDED
HOWEVER HIS COMING HAD BEEN A
BOON AND HIS PRESENCE WAS A GODSEND
BEFORE FATHER MADELEINE'S ARRIVAL
EVERYTHING HAD LANGUISHED IN THE COUNTRY NOW EVERYTHING LIVED WITH
A HEALTHY LIFE OF TOIL
A STRONG CIRCULATION WARMED EVERYTHING AND
PENETRATED EVERYWHERE
SLACK SEASONS AND WRETCHEDNESS WERE UNKNOWN
THERE WAS NO POCKET SO OBSCURE THAT IT HAD NOT A LITTLE MONEY IN IT NO
DWELLING SO LOWLY THAT THERE WAS NOT SOME LITTLE JOY WITHIN IT
FATHER MADELEINE GAVE EMPLOYMENT TO EVERY ONE
HE EXACTED BUT ONE THING
BE AN HONEST MAN
BE AN HONEST WOMAN
AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE MIDST OF THIS ACTIVITY OF WHICH HE WAS THE CAUSE
AND THE PIVOT FATHER MADELEINE MADE HIS FORTUNE BUT A SINGULAR THING
IN A SIMPLE MAN OF BUSINESS IT DID NOT SEEM AS THOUGH THAT WERE HIS
CHIEF CARE
HE APPEARED TO BE THINKING MUCH OF OTHERS AND LITTLE OF
HIMSELF
IN 1820 HE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE A SUM OF SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY
THOUSAND FRANCS LODGED IN HIS NAME WITH LAFFITTE BUT BEFORE RESERVING
THESE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS HE HAD SPENT MORE THAN A
MILLION FOR THE TOWN AND ITS POOR
THE HOSPITAL WAS BADLY ENDOWED HE FOUNDED SIX BEDS THERE
M
SUR M
IS
DIVIDED INTO THE UPPER AND THE LOWER TOWN
THE LOWER TOWN IN WHICH HE
LIVED HAD BUT ONE SCHOOL A MISERABLE HOVEL WHICH WAS FALLING TO RUIN
HE CONSTRUCTED TWO ONE FOR GIRLS THE OTHER FOR BOYS
HE ALLOTTED A
SALARY FROM HIS OWN FUNDS TO THE TWO INSTRUCTORS A SALARY TWICE AS
LARGE AS THEIR MEAGRE OFFICIAL SALARY AND ONE DAY HE SAID TO SOME ONE
WHO EXPRESSED SURPRISE THE TWO PRIME FUNCTIONARIES OF THE STATE ARE
THE NURSE AND THE SCHOOLMASTER HE CREATED AT HIS OWN EXPENSE AN INFANT
SCHOOL A THING THEN ALMOST UNKNOWN IN FRANCE AND A FUND FOR AIDING OLD
AND INFIRM WORKMEN
AS HIS FACTORY WAS A CENTRE A NEW QUARTER IN WHICH
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY INDIGENT FAMILIES ROSE RAPIDLY AROUND HIM HE
ESTABLISHED THERE A FREE DISPENSARY
AT FIRST WHEN THEY WATCHED HIS BEGINNINGS THE GOOD SOULS SAID HE'S
A JOLLY FELLOW WHO MEANS TO GET RICH WHEN THEY SAW HIM ENRICHING
THE COUNTRY BEFORE HE ENRICHED HIMSELF THE GOOD SOULS SAID HE IS
AN AMBITIOUS MAN THIS SEEMED ALL THE MORE PROBABLE SINCE THE MAN WAS
RELIGIOUS AND EVEN PRACTISED HIS RELIGION TO A CERTAIN DEGREE A THING
WHICH WAS VERY FAVORABLY VIEWED AT THAT EPOCH
HE WENT REGULARLY TO
LOW MASS EVERY SUNDAY
THE LOCAL DEPUTY WHO NOSED OUT ALL RIVALRY
EVERYWHERE SOON BEGAN TO GROW UNEASY OVER THIS RELIGION
THIS DEPUTY
HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE EMPIRE AND SHARED THE
RELIGIOUS IDEAS OF A FATHER OF THE ORATOIRE KNOWN UNDER THE NAME
OF FOUCHE DUC D'OTRANTE WHOSE CREATURE AND FRIEND HE HAD BEEN
HE
INDULGED IN GENTLE RAILLERY AT GOD WITH CLOSED DOORS
BUT WHEN HE BEHELD
THE WEALTHY MANUFACTURER MADELEINE GOING TO LOW MASS AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
HE PERCEIVED IN HIM A POSSIBLE CANDIDATE AND RESOLVED TO OUTDO HIM HE
TOOK A JESUIT CONFESSOR AND WENT TO HIGH MASS AND TO VESPERS
AMBITION
WAS AT THAT TIME IN THE DIRECT ACCEPTATION OF THE WORD A RACE TO THE
STEEPLE
THE POOR PROFITED BY THIS TERROR AS WELL AS THE GOOD GOD FOR
THE HONORABLE DEPUTY ALSO FOUNDED TWO BEDS IN THE HOSPITAL WHICH MADE
TWELVE
NEVERTHELESS IN 1819 A RUMOR ONE MORNING CIRCULATED THROUGH THE TOWN
TO THE EFFECT THAT ON THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PREFECT AND IN
CONSIDERATION OF THE SERVICES RENDERED BY HIM TO THE COUNTRY FATHER
MADELEINE WAS TO BE APPOINTED BY THE KING MAYOR OF M
SUR M
THOSE WHO
HAD PRONOUNCED THIS NEW COMER TO BE AN AMBITIOUS FELLOW SEIZED WITH
DELIGHT ON THIS OPPORTUNITY WHICH ALL MEN DESIRE TO EXCLAIM THERE
WHAT DID WE SAY ALL M
SUR M
WAS IN AN UPROAR
THE RUMOR WAS WELL
FOUNDED
SEVERAL DAYS LATER THE APPOINTMENT APPEARED IN THE MONITEUR
ON
THE FOLLOWING DAY FATHER MADELEINE REFUSED
IN THIS SAME YEAR OF 1819 THE PRODUCTS OF THE NEW PROCESS INVENTED BY
MADELEINE FIGURED IN THE INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITION WHEN THE JURY MADE THEIR
REPORT THE KING APPOINTED THE INVENTOR A CHEVALIER OF THE LEGION OF
HONOR
A FRESH EXCITEMENT IN THE LITTLE TOWN
WELL SO IT WAS THE CROSS
THAT HE WANTED FATHER MADELEINE REFUSED THE CROSS
DECIDEDLY THIS MAN WAS AN ENIGMA
THE GOOD SOULS GOT OUT OF THEIR
PREDICAMENT BY SAYING AFTER ALL HE IS SOME SORT OF AN ADVENTURER
WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE COUNTRY OWED MUCH TO HIM THE POOR OWED HIM
EVERYTHING HE WAS SO USEFUL AND HE WAS SO GENTLE THAT PEOPLE HAD BEEN
OBLIGED TO HONOR AND RESPECT HIM
HIS WORKMEN IN PARTICULAR ADORED
HIM AND HE ENDURED THIS ADORATION WITH A SORT OF MELANCHOLY GRAVITY
WHEN HE WAS KNOWN TO BE RICH PEOPLE IN SOCIETY BOWED TO HIM AND
HE RECEIVED INVITATIONS IN THE TOWN HE WAS CALLED IN TOWN MONSIEUR
MADELEINE HIS WORKMEN AND THE CHILDREN CONTINUED TO CALL HIM FATHER
MADELEINE AND THAT WAS WHAT WAS MOST ADAPTED TO MAKE HIM SMILE
IN
PROPORTION AS HE MOUNTED THROVE INVITATIONS RAINED DOWN UPON HIM
SOCIETY CLAIMED HIM FOR ITS OWN
THE PRIM LITTLE DRAWING ROOMS ON
M
SUR M WHICH OF COURSE HAD AT FIRST BEEN CLOSED TO THE ARTISAN
OPENED BOTH LEAVES OF THEIR FOLDING DOORS TO THE MILLIONNAIRE
THEY MADE
A THOUSAND ADVANCES TO HIM
HE REFUSED
THIS TIME THE GOOD GOSSIPS HAD NO TROUBLE
HE IS AN IGNORANT MAN OF
NO EDUCATION
NO ONE KNOWS WHERE HE CAME FROM
HE WOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO
BEHAVE IN SOCIETY
IT HAS NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY PROVED THAT HE KNOWS HOW
TO READ
WHEN THEY SAW HIM MAKING MONEY THEY SAID HE IS A MAN OF BUSINESS
WHEN THEY SAW HIM SCATTERING HIS MONEY ABOUT THEY SAID HE IS AN
AMBITIOUS MAN WHEN HE WAS SEEN TO DECLINE HONORS THEY SAID HE IS
AN ADVENTURER WHEN THEY SAW HIM REPULSE SOCIETY THEY SAID HE IS A
BRUTE
IN 1820 FIVE YEARS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN M
SUR M THE SERVICES WHICH
HE HAD RENDERED TO THE DISTRICT WERE SO DAZZLING THE OPINION OF
THE WHOLE COUNTRY ROUND ABOUT WAS SO UNANIMOUS THAT THE KING AGAIN
APPOINTED HIM MAYOR OF THE TOWN
HE AGAIN DECLINED BUT THE PREFECT
RESISTED HIS REFUSAL ALL THE NOTABILITIES OF THE PLACE CAME TO IMPLORE
HIM THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET BESOUGHT HIM THE URGING WAS SO VIGOROUS
THAT HE ENDED BY ACCEPTING
IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE THING WHICH SEEMED
CHIEFLY TO BRING HIM TO A DECISION WAS THE ALMOST IRRITATED APOSTROPHE
ADDRESSED TO HIM BY AN OLD WOMAN OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED TO HIM FROM
HER THRESHOLD IN AN ANGRY WAY A GOOD MAYOR IS A USEFUL THING
IS HE
DRAWING BACK BEFORE THE GOOD WHICH HE CAN DO
THIS WAS THE THIRD PHASE OF HIS ASCENT
FATHER MADELEINE HAD BECOME
MONSIEUR MADELEINE
MONSIEUR MADELEINE BECAME MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
CHAPTER III SUMS DEPOSITED WITH LAFFITTE
ON THE OTHER HAND HE REMAINED AS SIMPLE AS ON THE FIRST DAY
HE HAD
GRAY HAIR A SERIOUS EYE THE SUNBURNED COMPLEXION OF A LABORER THE
THOUGHTFUL VISAGE OF A PHILOSOPHER
HE HABITUALLY WORE A HAT WITH A
WIDE BRIM AND A LONG COAT OF COARSE CLOTH BUTTONED TO THE CHIN
HE
FULFILLED HIS DUTIES AS MAYOR BUT WITH THAT EXCEPTION HE LIVED IN
SOLITUDE
HE SPOKE TO BUT FEW PEOPLE
HE AVOIDED POLITE ATTENTIONS
HE ESCAPED QUICKLY HE SMILED TO RELIEVE HIMSELF OF THE NECESSITY OF
TALKING HE GAVE IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THE NECESSITY FOR SMILING THE
WOMEN SAID OF HIM WHAT A GOOD NATURED BEAR HIS PLEASURE CONSISTED IN
STROLLING IN THE FIELDS
HE ALWAYS TOOK HIS MEALS ALONE WITH AN OPEN BOOK BEFORE HIM WHICH HE
READ
HE HAD A WELL SELECTED LITTLE LIBRARY
HE LOVED BOOKS BOOKS
ARE COLD BUT SAFE FRIENDS
IN PROPORTION AS LEISURE CAME TO HIM WITH
FORTUNE HE SEEMED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT TO CULTIVATE HIS MIND
IT HAD
BEEN OBSERVED THAT EVER SINCE HIS ARRIVAL AT M
SUR M
HIS LANGUAGE
HAD GROWN MORE POLISHED MORE CHOICE AND MORE GENTLE WITH EVERY PASSING
YEAR
HE LIKED TO CARRY A GUN WITH HIM ON HIS STROLLS BUT HE RARELY
MADE USE OF IT
WHEN HE DID HAPPEN TO DO SO HIS SHOOTING WAS SOMETHING
SO INFALLIBLE AS TO INSPIRE TERROR
HE NEVER KILLED AN INOFFENSIVE
ANIMAL
HE NEVER SHOT AT A LITTLE BIRD
ALTHOUGH HE WAS NO LONGER YOUNG IT WAS THOUGHT THAT HE WAS STILL
PRODIGIOUSLY STRONG
HE OFFERED HIS ASSISTANCE TO ANY ONE WHO WAS IN
NEED OF IT LIFTED A HORSE RELEASED A WHEEL CLOGGED IN THE MUD OR
STOPPED A RUNAWAY BULL BY THE HORNS
HE ALWAYS HAD HIS POCKETS FULL
OF MONEY WHEN HE WENT OUT BUT THEY WERE EMPTY ON HIS RETURN
WHEN HE
PASSED THROUGH A VILLAGE THE RAGGED BRATS RAN JOYOUSLY AFTER HIM AND
SURROUNDED HIM LIKE A SWARM OF GNATS
IT WAS THOUGHT THAT HE MUST IN THE PAST HAVE LIVED A COUNTRY LIFE
SINCE HE KNEW ALL SORTS OF USEFUL SECRETS WHICH HE TAUGHT TO THE
PEASANTS
HE TAUGHT THEM HOW TO DESTROY SCURF ON WHEAT BY SPRINKLING IT
AND THE GRANARY AND INUNDATING THE CRACKS IN THE FLOOR WITH A SOLUTION
OF COMMON SALT AND HOW TO CHASE AWAY WEEVILS BY HANGING UP ORVIOT IN
BLOOM EVERYWHERE ON THE WALLS AND THE CEILINGS AMONG THE GRASS AND IN
THE HOUSES
HE HAD RECIPES FOR EXTERMINATING FROM A FIELD BLIGHT TARES FOXTAIL
AND ALL PARASITIC GROWTHS WHICH DESTROY THE WHEAT
HE DEFENDED A RABBIT
WARREN AGAINST RATS SIMPLY BY THE ODOR OF A GUINEA PIG WHICH HE PLACED
IN IT
ONE DAY HE SAW SOME COUNTRY PEOPLE BUSILY ENGAGED IN PULLING UP NETTLES
HE EXAMINED THE PLANTS WHICH WERE UPROOTED AND ALREADY DRIED AND SAID
THEY ARE DEAD
NEVERTHELESS IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO KNOW HOW TO
MAKE USE OF THEM
WHEN THE NETTLE IS YOUNG THE LEAF MAKES AN EXCELLENT
VEGETABLE WHEN IT IS OLDER IT HAS FILAMENTS AND FIBRES LIKE HEMP AND
FLAX
NETTLE CLOTH IS AS GOOD AS LINEN CLOTH
CHOPPED UP NETTLES ARE
GOOD FOR POULTRY POUNDED THEY ARE GOOD FOR HORNED CATTLE
THE SEED OF
THE NETTLE MIXED WITH FODDER GIVES GLOSS TO THE HAIR OF ANIMALS THE
ROOT MIXED WITH SALT PRODUCES A BEAUTIFUL YELLOW COLORING MATTER
MOREOVER IT IS AN EXCELLENT HAY WHICH CAN BE CUT TWICE
AND WHAT IS
REQUIRED FOR THE NETTLE A LITTLE SOIL NO CARE NO CULTURE
ONLY THE
SEED FALLS AS IT IS RIPE AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO COLLECT IT
THAT
IS ALL
WITH THE EXERCISE OF A LITTLE CARE THE NETTLE COULD BE MADE
USEFUL IT IS NEGLECTED AND IT BECOMES HURTFUL
IT IS EXTERMINATED
HOW
MANY MEN RESEMBLE THE NETTLE HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE REMEMBER THIS
MY FRIENDS THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS BAD PLANTS OR BAD MEN
THERE ARE
ONLY BAD CULTIVATORS
THE CHILDREN LOVED HIM BECAUSE HE KNEW HOW TO MAKE CHARMING LITTLE
TRIFLES OF STRAW AND COCOANUTS
WHEN HE SAW THE DOOR OF A CHURCH HUNG IN BLACK HE ENTERED HE SOUGHT
OUT FUNERALS AS OTHER MEN SEEK CHRISTENINGS
WIDOWHOOD AND THE GRIEF OF
OTHERS ATTRACTED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT GENTLENESS HE MINGLED WITH
THE FRIENDS CLAD IN MOURNING WITH FAMILIES DRESSED IN BLACK WITH
THE PRIESTS GROANING AROUND A COFFIN
HE SEEMED TO LIKE TO GIVE TO HIS
THOUGHTS FOR TEXT THESE FUNEREAL PSALMODIES FILLED WITH THE VISION OF
THE OTHER WORLD
WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON HEAVEN HE LISTENED WITH A
SORT OF ASPIRATION TOWARDS ALL THE MYSTERIES OF THE INFINITE THOSE SAD
VOICES WHICH SING ON THE VERGE OF THE OBSCURE ABYSS OF DEATH
HE PERFORMED A MULTITUDE OF GOOD ACTIONS CONCEALING HIS AGENCY IN THEM
AS A MAN CONCEALS HIMSELF BECAUSE OF EVIL ACTIONS
HE PENETRATED HOUSES
PRIVATELY AT NIGHT HE ASCENDED STAIRCASES FURTIVELY
A POOR WRETCH
ON RETURNING TO HIS ATTIC WOULD FIND THAT HIS DOOR HAD BEEN OPENED
SOMETIMES EVEN FORCED DURING HIS ABSENCE
THE POOR MAN MADE A CLAMOR
OVER IT SOME MALEFACTOR HAD BEEN THERE HE ENTERED AND THE FIRST
THING HE BEHELD WAS A PIECE OF GOLD LYING FORGOTTEN ON SOME PIECE OF
FURNITURE
THE MALEFACTOR WHO HAD BEEN THERE WAS FATHER MADELEINE
HE WAS AFFABLE AND SAD
THE PEOPLE SAID THERE IS A RICH MAN WHO HAS
NOT A HAUGHTY AIR
THERE IS A HAPPY MAN WHO HAS NOT A CONTENTED AIR
SOME PEOPLE MAINTAINED THAT HE WAS A MYSTERIOUS PERSON AND THAT NO
ONE EVER ENTERED HIS CHAMBER WHICH WAS A REGULAR ANCHORITE'S CELL
FURNISHED WITH WINGED HOUR GLASSES AND ENLIVENED BY CROSS BONES AND
SKULLS OF DEAD MEN THIS WAS MUCH TALKED OF SO THAT ONE OF THE ELEGANT
AND MALICIOUS YOUNG WOMEN OF M
SUR M
CAME TO HIM ONE DAY AND ASKED
MONSIEUR LE MAIRE PRAY SHOW US YOUR CHAMBER
IT IS SAID TO BE A
GROTTO HE SMILED AND INTRODUCED THEM INSTANTLY INTO THIS GROTTO
THEY WERE WELL PUNISHED FOR THEIR CURIOSITY
THE ROOM WAS VERY SIMPLY
FURNISHED IN MAHOGANY WHICH WAS RATHER UGLY LIKE ALL FURNITURE OF
THAT SORT AND HUNG WITH PAPER WORTH TWELVE SOUS
THEY COULD SEE NOTHING
REMARKABLE ABOUT IT EXCEPT TWO CANDLESTICKS OF ANTIQUE PATTERN WHICH
STOOD ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE AND APPEARED TO BE SILVER FOR THEY WERE
HALL MARKED AN OBSERVATION FULL OF THE TYPE OF WIT OF PETTY TOWNS
NEVERTHELESS PEOPLE CONTINUED TO SAY THAT NO ONE EVER GOT INTO THE
ROOM AND THAT IT WAS A HERMIT'S CAVE A MYSTERIOUS RETREAT A HOLE A
TOMB
IT WAS ALSO WHISPERED ABOUT THAT HE HAD IMMENSE SUMS DEPOSITED WITH
LAFFITTE WITH THIS PECULIAR FEATURE THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS AT HIS
IMMEDIATE DISPOSAL SO THAT IT WAS ADDED M
MADELEINE COULD MAKE HIS
APPEARANCE AT LAFFITTE'S ANY MORNING SIGN A RECEIPT AND CARRY OFF HIS
TWO OR THREE MILLIONS IN TEN MINUTES
IN REALITY THESE TWO OR THREE
MILLIONS WERE REDUCIBLE AS WE HAVE SAID TO SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY OR
FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS
CHAPTER IV M
MADELEINE IN MOURNING
AT THE BEGINNING OF 1820 THE NEWSPAPERS ANNOUNCED THE DEATH OF M
MYRIEL BISHOP OF D SURNAMED MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU WHO HAD DIED
IN THE ODOR OF SANCTITY AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY TWO
THE BISHOP OF D TO SUPPLY HERE A DETAIL WHICH THE PAPERS
OMITTED HAD BEEN BLIND FOR MANY YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH AND CONTENT TO
BE BLIND AS HIS SISTER WAS BESIDE HIM
LET US REMARK BY THE WAY THAT TO BE BLIND AND TO BE LOVED IS IN FACT
ONE OF THE MOST STRANGELY EXQUISITE FORMS OF HAPPINESS UPON THIS EARTH
WHERE NOTHING IS COMPLETE
TO HAVE CONTINUALLY AT ONE'S SIDE A WOMAN A
DAUGHTER A SISTER A CHARMING BEING WHO IS THERE BECAUSE YOU NEED HER
AND BECAUSE SHE CANNOT DO WITHOUT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE ARE INDISPENSABLE
TO A PERSON WHO IS NECESSARY TO US TO BE ABLE TO INCESSANTLY MEASURE
ONE'S AFFECTION BY THE AMOUNT OF HER PRESENCE WHICH SHE BESTOWS ON US
AND TO SAY TO OURSELVES SINCE SHE CONSECRATES THE WHOLE OF HER TIME
TO ME IT IS BECAUSE I POSSESS THE WHOLE OF HER HEART TO BEHOLD HER
THOUGHT IN LIEU OF HER FACE TO BE ABLE TO VERIFY THE FIDELITY OF ONE
BEING AMID THE ECLIPSE OF THE WORLD TO REGARD THE RUSTLE OF A GOWN
AS THE SOUND OF WINGS TO HEAR HER COME AND GO RETIRE SPEAK RETURN
SING AND TO THINK THAT ONE IS THE CENTRE OF THESE STEPS OF THIS
SPEECH TO MANIFEST AT EACH INSTANT ONE'S PERSONAL ATTRACTION TO FEEL
ONE'S SELF ALL THE MORE POWERFUL BECAUSE OF ONE'S INFIRMITY TO BECOME
IN ONE'S OBSCURITY AND THROUGH ONE'S OBSCURITY THE STAR AROUND WHICH
THIS ANGEL GRAVITATES FEW FELICITIES EQUAL THIS
THE SUPREME HAPPINESS
OF LIFE CONSISTS IN THE CONVICTION THAT ONE IS LOVED LOVED FOR
ONE'S OWN SAKE LET US SAY RATHER LOVED IN SPITE OF ONE'S SELF THIS
CONVICTION THE BLIND MAN POSSESSES
TO BE SERVED IN DISTRESS IS TO BE
CARESSED
DOES HE LACK ANYTHING NO
ONE DOES NOT LOSE THE SIGHT WHEN
ONE HAS LOVE
AND WHAT LOVE A LOVE WHOLLY CONSTITUTED OF VIRTUE THERE
IS NO BLINDNESS WHERE THERE IS CERTAINTY
SOUL SEEKS SOUL GROPINGLY
AND FINDS IT
AND THIS SOUL FOUND AND TESTED IS A WOMAN
A HAND
SUSTAINS YOU IT IS HERS A MOUTH LIGHTLY TOUCHES YOUR BROW IT IS HER
MOUTH YOU HEAR A BREATH VERY NEAR YOU IT IS HERS
TO HAVE EVERYTHING
OF HER FROM HER WORSHIP TO HER PITY NEVER TO BE LEFT TO HAVE THAT
SWEET WEAKNESS AIDING YOU TO LEAN UPON THAT IMMOVABLE REED TO
TOUCH PROVIDENCE WITH ONE'S HANDS AND TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT IN
ONE'S ARMS GOD MADE TANGIBLE WHAT BLISS THE HEART THAT OBSCURE
CELESTIAL FLOWER UNDERGOES A MYSTERIOUS BLOSSOMING
ONE WOULD NOT
EXCHANGE THAT SHADOW FOR ALL BRIGHTNESS THE ANGEL SOUL IS THERE
UNINTERRUPTEDLY THERE IF SHE DEPARTS IT IS BUT TO RETURN AGAIN SHE
VANISHES LIKE A DREAM AND REAPPEARS LIKE REALITY
ONE FEELS WARMTH
APPROACHING AND BEHOLD SHE IS THERE
ONE OVERFLOWS WITH SERENITY WITH
GAYETY WITH ECSTASY ONE IS A RADIANCE AMID THE NIGHT
AND THERE ARE
A THOUSAND LITTLE CARES
NOTHINGS WHICH ARE ENORMOUS IN THAT VOID
THE
MOST INEFFABLE ACCENTS OF THE FEMININE VOICE EMPLOYED TO LULL YOU AND
SUPPLYING THE VANISHED UNIVERSE TO YOU
ONE IS CARESSED WITH THE SOUL
ONE SEES NOTHING BUT ONE FEELS THAT ONE IS ADORED
IT IS A PARADISE OF
SHADOWS
IT WAS FROM THIS PARADISE THAT MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME HAD PASSED TO THE
OTHER
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS DEATH WAS REPRINTED BY THE LOCAL JOURNAL OF M
SUR M
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY M
MADELEINE APPEARED CLAD WHOLLY IN BLACK
AND WITH CRAPE ON HIS HAT
THIS MOURNING WAS NOTICED IN THE TOWN AND COMMENTED ON
IT SEEMED
TO THROW A LIGHT ON M
MADELEINE'S ORIGIN
IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT SOME
RELATIONSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND THE VENERABLE BISHOP
HE HAS GONE
INTO MOURNING FOR THE BISHOP OF D SAID THE DRAWING ROOMS THIS
RAISED M
MADELEINE'S CREDIT GREATLY AND PROCURED FOR HIM INSTANTLY
AND AT ONE BLOW A CERTAIN CONSIDERATION IN THE NOBLE WORLD OF M
SUR
M
THE MICROSCOPIC FAUBOURG SAINT GERMAIN OF THE PLACE MEDITATED RAISING
THE QUARANTINE AGAINST M
MADELEINE THE PROBABLE RELATIVE OF A BISHOP
M
MADELEINE PERCEIVED THE ADVANCEMENT WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED BY THE
MORE NUMEROUS COURTESIES OF THE OLD WOMEN AND THE MORE PLENTIFUL SMILES
OF THE YOUNG ONES
ONE EVENING A RULER IN THAT PETTY GREAT WORLD WHO
WAS CURIOUS BY RIGHT OF SENIORITY VENTURED TO ASK HIM M
LE MAIRE IS
DOUBTLESS A COUSIN OF THE LATE BISHOP OF D
HE SAID NO MADAME
BUT RESUMED THE DOWAGER YOU ARE WEARING MOURNING FOR HIM
HE REPLIED IT IS BECAUSE I WAS A SERVANT IN HIS FAMILY IN MY YOUTH
ANOTHER THING WHICH WAS REMARKED WAS THAT EVERY TIME THAT HE
ENCOUNTERED IN THE TOWN A YOUNG SAVOYARD WHO WAS ROAMING ABOUT THE
COUNTRY AND SEEKING CHIMNEYS TO SWEEP THE MAYOR HAD HIM SUMMONED
INQUIRED HIS NAME AND GAVE HIM MONEY
THE LITTLE SAVOYARDS TOLD EACH
OTHER ABOUT IT A GREAT MANY OF THEM PASSED THAT WAY
CHAPTER V VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZON
LITTLE BY LITTLE AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME ALL THIS OPPOSITION
SUBSIDED
THERE HAD AT FIRST BEEN EXERCISED AGAINST M
MADELEINE
IN VIRTUE OF A SORT OF LAW WHICH ALL THOSE WHO RISE MUST SUBMIT TO
BLACKENING AND CALUMNIES THEN THEY GREW TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN
ILL NATURE THEN MERELY MALICIOUS REMARKS THEN EVEN THIS ENTIRELY
DISAPPEARED RESPECT BECAME COMPLETE UNANIMOUS CORDIAL AND TOWARDS
1821 THE MOMENT ARRIVED WHEN THE WORD MONSIEUR LE MAIRE WAS PRONOUNCED
AT M
SUR M
WITH ALMOST THE SAME ACCENT AS MONSEIGNEUR THE BISHOP
HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED IN D IN 1815
PEOPLE CAME FROM A DISTANCE OF TEN
LEAGUES AROUND TO CONSULT M
MADELEINE
HE PUT AN END TO DIFFERENCES
HE PREVENTED LAWSUITS HE RECONCILED ENEMIES
EVERY ONE TOOK HIM FOR THE
JUDGE AND WITH GOOD REASON
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE HAD FOR A SOUL THE
BOOK OF THE NATURAL LAW
IT WAS LIKE AN EPIDEMIC OF VENERATION WHICH IN
THE COURSE OF SIX OR SEVEN YEARS GRADUALLY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE
DISTRICT
ONE SINGLE MAN IN THE TOWN IN THE ARRONDISSEMENT ABSOLUTELY ESCAPED
THIS CONTAGION AND WHATEVER FATHER MADELEINE DID REMAINED HIS
OPPONENT AS THOUGH A SORT OF INCORRUPTIBLE AND IMPERTURBABLE INSTINCT
KEPT HIM ON THE ALERT AND UNEASY
IT SEEMS IN FACT AS THOUGH THERE
EXISTED IN CERTAIN MEN A VERITABLE BESTIAL INSTINCT THOUGH PURE AND
UPRIGHT LIKE ALL INSTINCTS WHICH CREATES ANTIPATHIES AND SYMPATHIES
WHICH FATALLY SEPARATES ONE NATURE FROM ANOTHER NATURE WHICH DOES NOT
HESITATE WHICH FEELS NO DISQUIET WHICH DOES NOT HOLD ITS PEACE
AND WHICH NEVER BELIES ITSELF CLEAR IN ITS OBSCURITY INFALLIBLE
IMPERIOUS INTRACTABLE STUBBORN TO ALL COUNSELS OF THE INTELLIGENCE
AND TO ALL THE DISSOLVENTS OF REASON AND WHICH IN WHATEVER MANNER
DESTINIES ARE ARRANGED SECRETLY WARNS THE MAN DOG OF THE PRESENCE OF
THE MAN CAT AND THE MAN FOX OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MAN LION
IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENED THAT WHEN M
MADELEINE WAS PASSING ALONG A
STREET CALM AFFECTIONATE SURROUNDED BY THE BLESSINGS OF ALL A MAN OF
LOFTY STATURE CLAD IN AN IRON GRAY FROCK COAT ARMED WITH A HEAVY
CANE AND WEARING A BATTERED HAT TURNED ROUND ABRUPTLY BEHIND HIM AND
FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES UNTIL HE DISAPPEARED WITH FOLDED ARMS AND
A SLOW SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND HIS UPPER LIP RAISED IN COMPANY WITH
HIS LOWER TO HIS NOSE A SORT OF SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE WHICH MIGHT BE
TRANSLATED BY WHAT IS THAT MAN AFTER ALL I CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN HIM
SOMEWHERE
IN ANY CASE I AM NOT HIS DUPE
THIS PERSON GRAVE WITH A GRAVITY WHICH WAS ALMOST MENACING WAS ONE
OF THOSE MEN WHO EVEN WHEN ONLY SEEN BY A RAPID GLIMPSE ARREST THE
SPECTATOR'S ATTENTION
HIS NAME WAS JAVERT AND HE BELONGED TO THE POLICE
AT M
SUR M
HE EXERCISED THE UNPLEASANT BUT USEFUL FUNCTIONS OF AN
INSPECTOR
HE HAD NOT SEEN MADELEINE'S BEGINNINGS
JAVERT OWED THE POST
WHICH HE OCCUPIED TO THE PROTECTION OF M
CHABOUILLET THE SECRETARY OF
THE MINISTER OF STATE COMTE ANGELES THEN PREFECT OF POLICE AT PARIS
WHEN JAVERT ARRIVED AT M
SUR M
THE FORTUNE OF THE GREAT MANUFACTURER
WAS ALREADY MADE AND FATHER MADELEINE HAD BECOME MONSIEUR MADELEINE
CERTAIN POLICE OFFICERS HAVE A PECULIAR PHYSIOGNOMY WHICH IS
COMPLICATED WITH AN AIR OF BASENESS MINGLED WITH AN AIR OF AUTHORITY
JAVERT POSSESSED THIS PHYSIOGNOMY MINUS THE BASENESS
IT IS OUR CONVICTION THAT IF SOULS WERE VISIBLE TO THE EYES WE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO SEE DISTINCTLY THAT STRANGE THING THAT EACH ONE INDIVIDUAL
OF THE HUMAN RACE CORRESPONDS TO SOME ONE OF THE SPECIES OF THE ANIMAL
CREATION AND WE COULD EASILY RECOGNIZE THIS TRUTH HARDLY PERCEIVED
BY THE THINKER THAT FROM THE OYSTER TO THE EAGLE FROM THE PIG TO THE
TIGER ALL ANIMALS EXIST IN MAN AND THAT EACH ONE OF THEM IS IN A MAN
SOMETIMES EVEN SEVERAL OF THEM AT A TIME
ANIMALS ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN THE FIGURES OF OUR VIRTUES AND OUR VICES
STRAYING BEFORE OUR EYES THE VISIBLE PHANTOMS OF OUR SOULS
GOD SHOWS
THEM TO US IN ORDER TO INDUCE US TO REFLECT
ONLY SINCE ANIMALS ARE MERE
SHADOWS GOD HAS NOT MADE THEM CAPABLE OF EDUCATION IN THE FULL SENSE
OF THE WORD WHAT IS THE USE ON THE CONTRARY OUR SOULS BEING REALITIES
AND HAVING A GOAL WHICH IS APPROPRIATE TO THEM GOD HAS BESTOWED ON
THEM INTELLIGENCE THAT IS TO SAY THE POSSIBILITY OF EDUCATION
SOCIAL
EDUCATION WHEN WELL DONE CAN ALWAYS DRAW FROM A SOUL OF WHATEVER SORT
IT MAY BE THE UTILITY WHICH IT CONTAINS
THIS BE IT SAID IS OF COURSE FROM THE RESTRICTED POINT OF VIEW OF THE
TERRESTRIAL LIFE WHICH IS APPARENT AND WITHOUT PREJUDGING THE PROFOUND
QUESTION OF THE ANTERIOR OR ULTERIOR PERSONALITY OF THE BEINGS WHICH ARE
NOT MAN
THE VISIBLE I IN NOWISE AUTHORIZES THE THINKER TO DENY THE
LATENT I
HAVING MADE THIS RESERVATION LET US PASS ON
NOW IF THE READER WILL ADMIT FOR A MOMENT WITH US THAT IN EVERY MAN
THERE IS ONE OF THE ANIMAL SPECIES OF CREATION IT WILL BE EASY FOR US
TO SAY WHAT THERE WAS IN POLICE OFFICER JAVERT
THE PEASANTS OF ASTURIAS ARE CONVINCED THAT IN EVERY LITTER OF WOLVES
THERE IS ONE DOG WHICH IS KILLED BY THE MOTHER BECAUSE OTHERWISE AS
HE GREW UP HE WOULD DEVOUR THE OTHER LITTLE ONES
GIVE TO THIS DOG SON OF A WOLF A HUMAN FACE AND THE RESULT WILL BE
JAVERT
JAVERT HAD BEEN BORN IN PRISON OF A FORTUNE TELLER WHOSE HUSBAND WAS
IN THE GALLEYS
AS HE GREW UP HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS OUTSIDE THE PALE
OF SOCIETY AND HE DESPAIRED OF EVER RE ENTERING IT
HE OBSERVED THAT
SOCIETY UNPARDONINGLY EXCLUDES TWO CLASSES OF MEN THOSE WHO ATTACK
IT AND THOSE WHO GUARD IT HE HAD NO CHOICE EXCEPT BETWEEN THESE
TWO CLASSES AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF AN INDESCRIBABLE
FOUNDATION OF RIGIDITY REGULARITY AND PROBITY COMPLICATED WITH AN
INEXPRESSIBLE HATRED FOR THE RACE OF BOHEMIANS WHENCE HE WAS SPRUNG
HE
ENTERED THE POLICE HE SUCCEEDED THERE
AT FORTY YEARS OF AGE HE WAS AN
INSPECTOR
DURING HIS YOUTH HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE CONVICT ESTABLISHMENTS OF
THE SOUTH
BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER LET US COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE
WORDS HUMAN FACE WHICH WE HAVE JUST APPLIED TO JAVERT
THE HUMAN FACE OF JAVERT CONSISTED OF A FLAT NOSE WITH TWO DEEP
NOSTRILS TOWARDS WHICH ENORMOUS WHISKERS ASCENDED ON HIS CHEEKS
ONE
FELT ILL AT EASE WHEN HE SAW THESE TWO FORESTS AND THESE TWO CAVERNS
FOR THE FIRST TIME
WHEN JAVERT LAUGHED AND HIS LAUGH WAS RARE AND
TERRIBLE HIS THIN LIPS PARTED AND REVEALED TO VIEW NOT ONLY HIS TEETH
BUT HIS GUMS AND AROUND HIS NOSE THERE FORMED A FLATTENED AND SAVAGE
FOLD AS ON THE MUZZLE OF A WILD BEAST
JAVERT SERIOUS WAS A WATCHDOG
WHEN HE LAUGHED HE WAS A TIGER
AS FOR THE REST HE HAD VERY LITTLE
SKULL AND A GREAT DEAL OF JAW HIS HAIR CONCEALED HIS FOREHEAD AND
FELL OVER HIS EYEBROWS BETWEEN HIS EYES THERE WAS A PERMANENT CENTRAL
FROWN LIKE AN IMPRINT OF WRATH HIS GAZE WAS OBSCURE HIS MOUTH PURSED
UP AND TERRIBLE HIS AIR THAT OF FEROCIOUS COMMAND
THIS MAN WAS COMPOSED OF TWO VERY SIMPLE AND TWO VERY GOOD SENTIMENTS
COMPARATIVELY BUT HE RENDERED THEM ALMOST BAD BY DINT OF EXAGGERATING
THEM RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY HATRED OF REBELLION AND IN HIS EYES
MURDER ROBBERY ALL CRIMES ARE ONLY FORMS OF REBELLION
HE ENVELOPED
IN A BLIND AND PROFOUND FAITH EVERY ONE WHO HAD A FUNCTION IN THE STATE
FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE RURAL POLICEMAN
HE COVERED WITH SCORN
AVERSION AND DISGUST EVERY ONE WHO HAD ONCE CROSSED THE LEGAL THRESHOLD
OF EVIL
HE WAS ABSOLUTE AND ADMITTED NO EXCEPTIONS
ON THE ONE HAND
HE SAID THE FUNCTIONARY CAN MAKE NO MISTAKE THE MAGISTRATE IS NEVER
THE WRONG ON THE OTHER HAND HE SAID THESE MEN ARE IRREMEDIABLY
LOST
NOTHING GOOD CAN COME FROM THEM HE FULLY SHARED THE OPINION OF
THOSE EXTREME MINDS WHICH ATTRIBUTE TO HUMAN LAW I KNOW NOT WHAT POWER
OF MAKING OR IF THE READER WILL HAVE IT SO OF AUTHENTICATING DEMONS
AND WHO PLACE A STYX AT THE BASE OF SOCIETY
HE WAS STOICAL SERIOUS
AUSTERE A MELANCHOLY DREAMER HUMBLE AND HAUGHTY LIKE FANATICS
HIS
GLANCE WAS LIKE A GIMLET COLD AND PIERCING
HIS WHOLE LIFE HUNG ON
THESE TWO WORDS WATCHFULNESS AND SUPERVISION
HE HAD INTRODUCED A
STRAIGHT LINE INTO WHAT IS THE MOST CROOKED THING IN THE WORLD
HE POSSESSED THE CONSCIENCE OF HIS USEFULNESS THE RELIGION OF HIS
FUNCTIONS AND HE WAS A SPY AS OTHER MEN ARE PRIESTS
WOE TO THE MAN
WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE WOULD HAVE ARRESTED HIS OWN FATHER IF
THE LATTER HAD ESCAPED FROM THE GALLEYS AND WOULD HAVE DENOUNCED HIS
MOTHER IF SHE HAD BROKEN HER BAN
AND HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT WITH THAT
SORT OF INWARD SATISFACTION WHICH IS CONFERRED BY VIRTUE
AND WITHAL
A LIFE OF PRIVATION ISOLATION ABNEGATION CHASTITY WITH NEVER
A DIVERSION
IT WAS IMPLACABLE DUTY THE POLICE UNDERSTOOD AS THE
SPARTANS UNDERSTOOD SPARTA A PITILESS LYING IN WAIT A FEROCIOUS
HONESTY A MARBLE INFORMER BRUTUS IN VIDOCQ
JAVERT'S WHOLE PERSON WAS EXPRESSIVE OF THE MAN WHO SPIES AND WHO
WITHDRAWS HIMSELF FROM OBSERVATION
THE MYSTICAL SCHOOL OF JOSEPH DE
MAISTRE WHICH AT THAT EPOCH SEASONED WITH LOFTY COSMOGONY THOSE THINGS
WHICH WERE CALLED THE ULTRA NEWSPAPERS WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO DECLARE
THAT JAVERT WAS A SYMBOL
HIS BROW WAS NOT VISIBLE IT DISAPPEARED
BENEATH HIS HAT HIS EYES WERE NOT VISIBLE SINCE THEY WERE LOST UNDER
HIS EYEBROWS HIS CHIN WAS NOT VISIBLE FOR IT WAS PLUNGED IN HIS
CRAVAT HIS HANDS WERE NOT VISIBLE THEY WERE DRAWN UP IN HIS SLEEVES
AND HIS CANE WAS NOT VISIBLE HE CARRIED IT UNDER HIS COAT
BUT WHEN THE
OCCASION PRESENTED ITSELF THERE WAS SUDDENLY SEEN TO EMERGE FROM ALL
THIS SHADOW AS FROM AN AMBUSCADE A NARROW AND ANGULAR FOREHEAD A
BALEFUL GLANCE A THREATENING CHIN ENORMOUS HANDS AND A MONSTROUS
CUDGEL
IN HIS LEISURE MOMENTS WHICH WERE FAR FROM FREQUENT HE READ ALTHOUGH
HE HATED BOOKS THIS CAUSED HIM TO BE NOT WHOLLY ILLITERATE
THIS COULD
BE RECOGNIZED BY SOME EMPHASIS IN HIS SPEECH
AS WE HAVE SAID HE HAD NO VICES
WHEN HE WAS PLEASED WITH HIMSELF
HE PERMITTED HIMSELF A PINCH OF SNUFF
THEREIN LAY HIS CONNECTION WITH
HUMANITY
THE READER WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THAT JAVERT WAS THE
TERROR OF THAT WHOLE CLASS WHICH THE ANNUAL STATISTICS OF THE MINISTRY
OF JUSTICE DESIGNATES UNDER THE RUBRIC VAGRANTS
THE NAME OF JAVERT
ROUTED THEM BY ITS MERE UTTERANCE THE FACE OF JAVERT PETRIFIED THEM AT
SIGHT
SUCH WAS THIS FORMIDABLE MAN
JAVERT WAS LIKE AN EYE CONSTANTLY FIXED ON M
MADELEINE
AN EYE FULL OF
SUSPICION AND CONJECTURE
M
MADELEINE HAD FINALLY PERCEIVED THE FACT
BUT IT SEEMED TO BE OF NO IMPORTANCE TO HIM
HE DID NOT EVEN PUT A
QUESTION TO JAVERT HE NEITHER SOUGHT NOR AVOIDED HIM HE BORE THAT
EMBARRASSING AND ALMOST OPPRESSIVE GAZE WITHOUT APPEARING TO NOTICE IT
HE TREATED JAVERT WITH EASE AND COURTESY AS HE DID ALL THE REST OF THE
WORLD
IT WAS DIVINED FROM SOME WORDS WHICH ESCAPED JAVERT THAT HE HAD
SECRETLY INVESTIGATED WITH THAT CURIOSITY WHICH BELONGS TO THE RACE
AND INTO WHICH THERE ENTERS AS MUCH INSTINCT AS WILL ALL THE ANTERIOR
TRACES WHICH FATHER MADELEINE MIGHT HAVE LEFT ELSEWHERE
HE SEEMED TO
KNOW AND HE SOMETIMES SAID IN COVERT WORDS THAT SOME ONE HAD GLEANED
CERTAIN INFORMATION IN A CERTAIN DISTRICT ABOUT A FAMILY WHICH HAD
DISAPPEARED
ONCE HE CHANCED TO SAY AS HE WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF I
THINK I HAVE HIM THEN HE REMAINED PENSIVE FOR THREE DAYS AND UTTERED
NOT A WORD
IT SEEMED THAT THE THREAD WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HELD HAD
BROKEN
MOREOVER AND THIS FURNISHES THE NECESSARY CORRECTIVE FOR THE TOO
ABSOLUTE SENSE WHICH CERTAIN WORDS MIGHT PRESENT THERE CAN BE NOTHING
REALLY INFALLIBLE IN A HUMAN CREATURE AND THE PECULIARITY OF INSTINCT
IS THAT IT CAN BECOME CONFUSED THROWN OFF THE TRACK AND DEFEATED
OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE SUPERIOR TO INTELLIGENCE AND THE BEAST WOULD BE
FOUND TO BE PROVIDED WITH A BETTER LIGHT THAN MAN
JAVERT WAS EVIDENTLY SOMEWHAT DISCONCERTED BY THE PERFECT NATURALNESS
AND TRANQUILLITY OF M
MADELEINE
ONE DAY NEVERTHELESS HIS STRANGE MANNER APPEARED TO PRODUCE AN
IMPRESSION ON M
MADELEINE
IT WAS ON THE FOLLOWING OCCASION
CHAPTER VI FATHER FAUCHELEVENT
ONE MORNING M
MADELEINE WAS PASSING THROUGH AN UNPAVED ALLEY OF M
SUR
M HE HEARD A NOISE AND SAW A GROUP SOME DISTANCE AWAY
HE APPROACHED
AN OLD MAN NAMED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT HAD JUST FALLEN BENEATH HIS CART
HIS HORSE HAVING TUMBLED DOWN
THIS FAUCHELEVENT WAS ONE OF THE FEW ENEMIES WHOM M
MADELEINE HAD AT
THAT TIME
WHEN MADELEINE ARRIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FAUCHELEVENT AN
EX NOTARY AND A PEASANT WHO WAS ALMOST EDUCATED HAD A BUSINESS WHICH
WAS BEGINNING TO BE IN A BAD WAY
FAUCHELEVENT HAD SEEN THIS SIMPLE
WORKMAN GROW RICH WHILE HE A LAWYER WAS BEING RUINED
THIS HAD FILLED
HIM WITH JEALOUSY AND HE HAD DONE ALL HE COULD ON EVERY OCCASION
TO INJURE MADELEINE
THEN BANKRUPTCY HAD COME AND AS THE OLD MAN HAD
NOTHING LEFT BUT A CART AND A HORSE AND NEITHER FAMILY NOR CHILDREN HE
HAD TURNED CARTER
THE HORSE HAD TWO BROKEN LEGS AND COULD NOT RISE
THE OLD MAN WAS CAUGHT
IN THE WHEELS
THE FALL HAD BEEN SO UNLUCKY THAT THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THE
VEHICLE RESTED ON HIS BREAST
THE CART WAS QUITE HEAVILY LADEN
FATHER
FAUCHELEVENT WAS RATTLING IN THE THROAT IN THE MOST LAMENTABLE MANNER
THEY HAD TRIED BUT IN VAIN TO DRAG HIM OUT
AN UNMETHODICAL EFFORT
AID AWKWARDLY GIVEN A WRONG SHAKE MIGHT KILL HIM
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
DISENGAGE HIM OTHERWISE THAN BY LIFTING THE VEHICLE OFF OF HIM
JAVERT WHO HAD COME UP AT THE MOMENT OF THE ACCIDENT HAD SENT FOR A
JACK SCREW
M
MADELEINE ARRIVED
PEOPLE STOOD ASIDE RESPECTFULLY
HELP CRIED OLD FAUCHELEVENT
WHO WILL BE GOOD AND SAVE THE OLD MAN
M
MADELEINE TURNED TOWARDS THOSE PRESENT
IS THERE A JACK SCREW TO BE HAD
ONE HAS BEEN SENT FOR ANSWERED THE PEASANT
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET IT
THEY HAVE GONE FOR THE NEAREST TO FLACHOT'S PLACE WHERE THERE IS A
FARRIER BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IT WILL TAKE A GOOD QUARTER OF AN
HOUR
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR EXCLAIMED MADELEINE
IT HAD RAINED ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT THE SOIL WAS SOAKED
THE CART WAS SINKING DEEPER INTO THE EARTH EVERY MOMENT AND CRUSHING
THE OLD CARTER'S BREAST MORE AND MORE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS RIBS
WOULD BE BROKEN IN FIVE MINUTES MORE
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WAIT ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAID MADELEINE TO
THE PEASANTS WHO WERE STARING AT HIM
WE MUST
BUT IT WILL BE TOO LATE THEN DON'T YOU SEE THAT THE CART IS SINKING
WELL
LISTEN RESUMED MADELEINE THERE IS STILL ROOM ENOUGH UNDER THE CART
TO ALLOW A MAN TO CRAWL BENEATH IT AND RAISE IT WITH HIS BACK
ONLY HALF
A MINUTE AND THE POOR MAN CAN BE TAKEN OUT
IS THERE ANY ONE HERE WHO
HAS STOUT LOINS AND HEART THERE ARE FIVE LOUIS D'OR TO BE EARNED
NOT A MAN IN THE GROUP STIRRED
TEN LOUIS SAID MADELEINE
THE PERSONS PRESENT DROPPED THEIR EYES
ONE OF THEM MUTTERED A MAN
WOULD NEED TO BE DEVILISH STRONG
AND THEN HE RUNS THE RISK OF GETTING
CRUSHED
COME BEGAN MADELEINE AGAIN TWENTY LOUIS
THE SAME SILENCE
IT IS NOT THE WILL WHICH IS LACKING SAID A VOICE
M
MADELEINE TURNED ROUND AND RECOGNIZED JAVERT
HE HAD NOT NOTICED HIM
ON HIS ARRIVAL
JAVERT WENT ON
IT IS STRENGTH
ONE WOULD HAVE TO BE A TERRIBLE MAN TO DO SUCH A THING
AS LIFT A CART LIKE THAT ON HIS BACK
THEN GAZING FIXEDLY AT M
MADELEINE HE WENT ON EMPHASIZING EVERY WORD
THAT HE UTTERED
MONSIEUR MADELEINE I HAVE NEVER KNOWN BUT ONE MAN CAPABLE OF DOING
WHAT YOU ASK
MADELEINE SHUDDERED
JAVERT ADDED WITH AN AIR OF INDIFFERENCE BUT WITHOUT REMOVING HIS EYES
FROM MADELEINE
HE WAS A CONVICT
AH SAID MADELEINE
IN THE GALLEYS AT TOULON
MADELEINE TURNED PALE
MEANWHILE THE CART CONTINUED TO SINK SLOWLY
FATHER FAUCHELEVENT
RATTLED IN THE THROAT AND SHRIEKED
I AM STRANGLING MY RIBS ARE BREAKING A SCREW SOMETHING AH
MADELEINE GLANCED ABOUT HIM
IS THERE THEN NO ONE WHO WISHES TO EARN TWENTY LOUIS AND SAVE THE
LIFE OF THIS POOR OLD MAN
NO ONE STIRRED
JAVERT RESUMED
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN BUT ONE MAN WHO COULD TAKE THE PLACE OF A SCREW AND
HE WAS THAT CONVICT
AH IT IS CRUSHING ME CRIED THE OLD MAN
MADELEINE RAISED HIS HEAD MET JAVERT'S FALCON EYE STILL FIXED UPON
HIM LOOKED AT THE MOTIONLESS PEASANTS AND SMILED SADLY
THEN WITHOUT
SAYING A WORD HE FELL ON HIS KNEES AND BEFORE THE CROWD HAD EVEN HAD
TIME TO UTTER A CRY HE WAS UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE
A TERRIBLE MOMENT OF EXPECTATION AND SILENCE ENSUED
THEY BEHELD MADELEINE ALMOST FLAT ON HIS STOMACH BENEATH THAT TERRIBLE
WEIGHT MAKE TWO VAIN EFFORTS TO BRING HIS KNEES AND HIS ELBOWS
TOGETHER
THEY SHOUTED TO HIM FATHER MADELEINE COME OUT OLD
FAUCHELEVENT HIMSELF SAID TO HIM MONSIEUR MADELEINE GO AWAY YOU SEE
THAT I AM FATED TO DIE LEAVE ME YOU WILL GET YOURSELF CRUSHED ALSO
MADELEINE MADE NO REPLY
ALL THE SPECTATORS WERE PANTING
THE WHEELS HAD CONTINUED TO SINK AND
IT HAD BECOME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR MADELEINE TO MAKE HIS WAY FROM UNDER
THE VEHICLE
SUDDENLY THE ENORMOUS MASS WAS SEEN TO QUIVER THE CART ROSE SLOWLY THE
WHEELS HALF EMERGED FROM THE RUTS
THEY HEARD A STIFLED VOICE CRYING
MAKE HASTE HELP IT WAS MADELEINE WHO HAD JUST MADE A FINAL EFFORT
THEY RUSHED FORWARDS
THE DEVOTION OF A SINGLE MAN HAD GIVEN FORCE AND
COURAGE TO ALL
THE CART WAS RAISED BY TWENTY ARMS
OLD FAUCHELEVENT WAS
SAVED
MADELEINE ROSE
HE WAS PALE THOUGH DRIPPING WITH PERSPIRATION
HIS
CLOTHES WERE TORN AND COVERED WITH MUD
ALL WEPT
THE OLD MAN KISSED
HIS KNEES AND CALLED HIM THE GOOD GOD
AS FOR HIM HE BORE UPON
HIS COUNTENANCE AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION OF HAPPY AND CELESTIAL
SUFFERING AND HE FIXED HIS TRANQUIL EYE ON JAVERT WHO WAS STILL
STARING AT HIM
CHAPTER VII FAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARIS
FAUCHELEVENT HAD DISLOCATED HIS KNEEPAN IN HIS FALL
FATHER MADELEINE
HAD HIM CONVEYED TO AN INFIRMARY WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED FOR HIS
WORKMEN IN THE FACTORY BUILDING ITSELF AND WHICH WAS SERVED BY TWO
SISTERS OF CHARITY
ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE OLD MAN FOUND A
THOUSAND FRANC BANK NOTE ON HIS NIGHT STAND WITH THESE WORDS IN FATHER
MADELEINE'S WRITING I PURCHASE YOUR HORSE AND CART THE CART WAS
BROKEN AND THE HORSE WAS DEAD
FAUCHELEVENT RECOVERED BUT HIS KNEE
REMAINED STIFF
M
MADELEINE ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE SISTERS OF
CHARITY AND OF HIS PRIEST GOT THE GOOD MAN A PLACE AS GARDENER IN A
FEMALE CONVENT IN THE RUE SAINT ANTOINE IN PARIS
SOME TIME AFTERWARDS M
MADELEINE WAS APPOINTED MAYOR
THE FIRST TIME
THAT JAVERT BEHELD M
MADELEINE CLOTHED IN THE SCARF WHICH GAVE HIM
AUTHORITY OVER THE TOWN HE FELT THE SORT OF SHUDDER WHICH A WATCH DOG
MIGHT EXPERIENCE ON SMELLING A WOLF IN HIS MASTER'S CLOTHES
FROM
THAT TIME FORTH HE AVOIDED HIM AS MUCH AS HE POSSIBLY COULD
WHEN THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SERVICE IMPERATIVELY DEMANDED IT AND HE COULD
NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN MEET THE MAYOR HE ADDRESSED HIM WITH PROFOUND
RESPECT
THIS PROSPERITY CREATED AT M
SUR M
BY FATHER MADELEINE HAD BESIDES
THE VISIBLE SIGNS WHICH WE HAVE MENTIONED ANOTHER SYMPTOM WHICH WAS
NONE THE LESS SIGNIFICANT FOR NOT BEING VISIBLE
THIS NEVER DECEIVES
WHEN THE POPULATION SUFFERS WHEN WORK IS LACKING WHEN THERE IS NO
COMMERCE THE TAX PAYER RESISTS IMPOSTS THROUGH PENURY HE EXHAUSTS AND
OVERSTEPS HIS RESPITE AND THE STATE EXPENDS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN
THE CHARGES FOR COMPELLING AND COLLECTION
WHEN WORK IS ABUNDANT WHEN
THE COUNTRY IS RICH AND HAPPY THE TAXES ARE PAID EASILY AND COST THE
STATE NOTHING
IT MAY BE SAID THAT THERE IS ONE INFALLIBLE THERMOMETER
OF THE PUBLIC MISERY AND RICHES THE COST OF COLLECTING THE TAXES
IN THE COURSE OF SEVEN YEARS THE EXPENSE OF COLLECTING THE TAXES HAD
DIMINISHED THREE FOURTHS IN THE ARRONDISSEMENT OF M
SUR M AND THIS
LED TO THIS ARRONDISSEMENT BEING FREQUENTLY CITED FROM ALL THE REST BY
M
DE VILLELE THEN MINISTER OF FINANCE
SUCH WAS THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY WHEN FANTINE RETURNED THITHER
NO
ONE REMEMBERED HER
FORTUNATELY THE DOOR OF M
MADELEINE'S FACTORY WAS
LIKE THE FACE OF A FRIEND
SHE PRESENTED HERSELF THERE AND WAS ADMITTED
TO THE WOMEN'S WORKROOM
THE TRADE WAS ENTIRELY NEW TO FANTINE SHE
COULD NOT BE VERY SKILFUL AT IT AND SHE THEREFORE EARNED BUT LITTLE BY
HER DAY'S WORK BUT IT WAS SUFFICIENT THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED SHE WAS
EARNING HER LIVING
CHAPTER VIII MADAME VICTURNIEN EXPENDS THIRTY FRANCS ON MORALITY
WHEN FANTINE SAW THAT SHE WAS MAKING HER LIVING SHE FELT JOYFUL FOR A
MOMENT
TO LIVE HONESTLY BY HER OWN LABOR WHAT MERCY FROM HEAVEN THE
TASTE FOR WORK HAD REALLY RETURNED TO HER
SHE BOUGHT A LOOKING GLASS
TOOK PLEASURE IN SURVEYING IN IT HER YOUTH HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR HER FINE
TEETH SHE FORGOT MANY THINGS SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF COSETTE AND OF THE
POSSIBLE FUTURE AND WAS ALMOST HAPPY
SHE HIRED A LITTLE ROOM AND
FURNISHED ON CREDIT ON THE STRENGTH OF HER FUTURE WORK A LINGERING
TRACE OF HER IMPROVIDENT WAYS
AS SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO SAY THAT SHE WAS
MARRIED SHE TOOK GOOD CARE AS WE HAVE SEEN NOT TO MENTION HER LITTLE
GIRL
AT FIRST AS THE READER HAS SEEN SHE PAID THE THENARDIERS PROMPTLY
AS
SHE ONLY KNEW HOW TO SIGN HER NAME SHE WAS OBLIGED TO WRITE THROUGH A
PUBLIC LETTER WRITER
SHE WROTE OFTEN AND THIS WAS NOTICED
IT BEGAN TO BE SAID IN AN
UNDERTONE IN THE WOMEN'S WORKROOM THAT FANTINE WROTE LETTERS AND
THAT SHE HAD WAYS ABOUT HER
THERE IS NO ONE FOR SPYING ON PEOPLE'S ACTIONS LIKE THOSE WHO ARE
NOT CONCERNED IN THEM
WHY DOES THAT GENTLEMAN NEVER COME EXCEPT AT
NIGHTFALL WHY DOES MR
SO AND SO NEVER HANG HIS KEY ON ITS NAIL ON
TUESDAY WHY DOES HE ALWAYS TAKE THE NARROW STREETS WHY DOES MADAME
ALWAYS DESCEND FROM HER HACKNEY COACH BEFORE REACHING HER HOUSE WHY
DOES SHE SEND OUT TO PURCHASE SIX SHEETS OF NOTE PAPER WHEN SHE HAS A
WHOLE STATIONER'S SHOP FULL OF IT ETC
THERE EXIST BEINGS WHO FOR
THE SAKE OF OBTAINING THE KEY TO THESE ENIGMAS WHICH ARE MOREOVER OF
NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER TO THEM SPEND MORE MONEY WASTE MORE TIME
TAKE MORE TROUBLE THAN WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR TEN GOOD ACTIONS AND
THAT GRATUITOUSLY FOR THEIR OWN PLEASURE WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY OTHER
PAYMENT FOR THEIR CURIOSITY THAN CURIOSITY
THEY WILL FOLLOW UP SUCH AND
SUCH A MAN OR WOMAN FOR WHOLE DAYS THEY WILL DO SENTRY DUTY FOR HOURS
AT A TIME ON THE CORNERS OF THE STREETS UNDER ALLEY WAY DOORS AT NIGHT
IN COLD AND RAIN THEY WILL BRIBE ERRAND PORTERS THEY WILL MAKE THE
DRIVERS OF HACKNEY COACHES AND LACKEYS TIPSY BUY A WAITING MAID SUBORN
A PORTER
WHY FOR NO REASON
A PURE PASSION FOR SEEING KNOWING
AND PENETRATING INTO THINGS
A PURE ITCH FOR TALKING
AND OFTEN
THESE SECRETS ONCE KNOWN THESE MYSTERIES MADE PUBLIC THESE ENIGMAS
ILLUMINATED BY THE LIGHT OF DAY BRING ON CATASTROPHIES DUELS
FAILURES THE RUIN OF FAMILIES AND BROKEN LIVES TO THE GREAT JOY
OF THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND OUT EVERYTHING WITHOUT ANY INTEREST IN THE
MATTER AND BY PURE INSTINCT
A SAD THING
CERTAIN PERSONS ARE MALICIOUS SOLELY THROUGH A NECESSITY FOR TALKING
THEIR CONVERSATION THE CHAT OF THE DRAWING ROOM GOSSIP OF THE
ANTEROOM IS LIKE THOSE CHIMNEYS WHICH CONSUME WOOD RAPIDLY THEY NEED
A GREAT AMOUNT OF COMBUSTIBLES AND THEIR COMBUSTIBLES ARE FURNISHED BY
THEIR NEIGHBORS
SO FANTINE WAS WATCHED
IN ADDITION MANY A ONE WAS JEALOUS OF HER GOLDEN HAIR AND OF HER WHITE
TEETH
IT WAS REMARKED THAT IN THE WORKROOM SHE OFTEN TURNED ASIDE IN THE
MIDST OF THE REST TO WIPE AWAY A TEAR
THESE WERE THE MOMENTS WHEN SHE
WAS THINKING OF HER CHILD PERHAPS ALSO OF THE MAN WHOM SHE HAD LOVED
BREAKING THE GLOOMY BONDS OF THE PAST IS A MOURNFUL TASK
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT SHE WROTE TWICE A MONTH AT LEAST AND THAT SHE
PAID THE CARRIAGE ON THE LETTER
THEY MANAGED TO OBTAIN THE ADDRESS
MONSIEUR MONSIEUR THENARDIER INN KEEPER AT MONTFERMEIL
THE PUBLIC
WRITER A GOOD OLD MAN WHO COULD NOT FILL HIS STOMACH WITH RED WINE
WITHOUT EMPTYING HIS POCKET OF SECRETS WAS MADE TO TALK IN THE
WINE SHOP
IN SHORT IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT FANTINE HAD A CHILD
SHE
MUST BE A PRETTY SORT OF A WOMAN AN OLD GOSSIP WAS FOUND WHO MADE THE
TRIP TO MONTFERMEIL TALKED TO THE THENARDIERS AND SAID ON HER RETURN
FOR MY FIVE AND THIRTY FRANCS I HAVE FREED MY MIND
I HAVE SEEN THE
CHILD
THE GOSSIP WHO DID THIS THING WAS A GORGON NAMED MADAME VICTURNIEN THE
GUARDIAN AND DOOR KEEPER OF EVERY ONE'S VIRTUE
MADAME VICTURNIEN WAS
FIFTY SIX AND RE ENFORCED THE MASK OF UGLINESS WITH THE MASK OF AGE
A QUAVERING VOICE A WHIMSICAL MIND
THIS OLD DAME HAD ONCE BEEN
YOUNG ASTONISHING FACT IN HER YOUTH IN '93 SHE HAD MARRIED A
MONK WHO HAD FLED FROM HIS CLOISTER IN A RED CAP AND PASSED FROM
THE BERNARDINES TO THE JACOBINS
SHE WAS DRY ROUGH PEEVISH SHARP
CAPTIOUS ALMOST VENOMOUS ALL THIS IN MEMORY OF HER MONK WHOSE WIDOW
SHE WAS AND WHO HAD RULED OVER HER MASTERFULLY AND BENT HER TO HIS
WILL
SHE WAS A NETTLE IN WHICH THE RUSTLE OF THE CASSOCK WAS VISIBLE
AT THE RESTORATION SHE HAD TURNED BIGOT AND THAT WITH SO MUCH ENERGY
THAT THE PRIESTS HAD FORGIVEN HER HER MONK
SHE HAD A SMALL PROPERTY
WHICH SHE BEQUEATHED WITH MUCH OSTENTATION TO A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY
SHE WAS IN HIGH FAVOR AT THE EPISCOPAL PALACE OF ARRAS
SO THIS MADAME
VICTURNIEN WENT TO MONTFERMEIL AND RETURNED WITH THE REMARK I HAVE
SEEN THE CHILD
ALL THIS TOOK TIME
FANTINE HAD BEEN AT THE FACTORY FOR MORE THAN A
YEAR WHEN ONE MORNING THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WORKROOM HANDED HER
FIFTY FRANCS FROM THE MAYOR TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER EMPLOYED
IN THE SHOP AND REQUESTED HER IN THE MAYOR'S NAME TO LEAVE THE
NEIGHBORHOOD
THIS WAS THE VERY MONTH WHEN THE THENARDIERS AFTER HAVING DEMANDED
TWELVE FRANCS INSTEAD OF SIX HAD JUST EXACTED FIFTEEN FRANCS INSTEAD OF
TWELVE
FANTINE WAS OVERWHELMED
SHE COULD NOT LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD SHE WAS
IN DEBT FOR HER RENT AND FURNITURE
FIFTY FRANCS WAS NOT SUFFICIENT
TO CANCEL THIS DEBT
SHE STAMMERED A FEW SUPPLICATING WORDS
THE
SUPERINTENDENT ORDERED HER TO LEAVE THE SHOP ON THE INSTANT
BESIDES
FANTINE WAS ONLY A MODERATELY GOOD WORKWOMAN
OVERCOME WITH SHAME EVEN
MORE THAN WITH DESPAIR SHE QUITTED THE SHOP AND RETURNED TO HER ROOM
SO HER FAULT WAS NOW KNOWN TO EVERY ONE
SHE NO LONGER FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO SAY A WORD
SHE WAS ADVISED TO
SEE THE MAYOR SHE DID NOT DARE
THE MAYOR HAD GIVEN HER FIFTY FRANCS
BECAUSE HE WAS GOOD AND HAD DISMISSED HER BECAUSE HE WAS JUST
SHE
BOWED BEFORE THE DECISION
CHAPTER IX MADAME VICTURNIEN'S SUCCESS
SO THE MONK'S WIDOW WAS GOOD FOR SOMETHING
BUT M
MADELEINE HAD HEARD NOTHING OF ALL THIS
LIFE IS FULL OF JUST
SUCH COMBINATIONS OF EVENTS
M
MADELEINE WAS IN THE HABIT OF ALMOST
NEVER ENTERING THE WOMEN'S WORKROOM
AT THE HEAD OF THIS ROOM HE HAD PLACED AN ELDERLY SPINSTER WHOM
THE PRIEST HAD PROVIDED FOR HIM AND HE HAD FULL CONFIDENCE IN THIS
SUPERINTENDENT A TRULY RESPECTABLE PERSON FIRM EQUITABLE UPRIGHT
FULL OF THE CHARITY WHICH CONSISTS IN GIVING BUT NOT HAVING IN THE SAME
DEGREE THAT CHARITY WHICH CONSISTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND IN FORGIVING
M
MADELEINE RELIED WHOLLY ON HER
THE BEST MEN ARE OFTEN OBLIGED
TO DELEGATE THEIR AUTHORITY
IT WAS WITH THIS FULL POWER AND THE
CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS DOING RIGHT THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT HAD
INSTITUTED THE SUIT JUDGED CONDEMNED AND EXECUTED FANTINE
AS REGARDS THE FIFTY FRANCS SHE HAD GIVEN THEM FROM A FUND WHICH M
MADELEINE HAD INTRUSTED TO HER FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES AND FOR GIVING
ASSISTANCE TO THE WORKWOMEN AND OF WHICH SHE RENDERED NO ACCOUNT
FANTINE TRIED TO OBTAIN A SITUATION AS A SERVANT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
SHE WENT FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE
NO ONE WOULD HAVE HER
SHE COULD NOT
LEAVE TOWN
THE SECOND HAND DEALER TO WHOM SHE WAS IN DEBT FOR HER
FURNITURE AND WHAT FURNITURE SAID TO HER IF YOU LEAVE I WILL HAVE
YOU ARRESTED AS A THIEF THE HOUSEHOLDER WHOM SHE OWED FOR HER RENT
SAID TO HER YOU ARE YOUNG AND PRETTY YOU CAN PAY SHE DIVIDED THE
FIFTY FRANCS BETWEEN THE LANDLORD AND THE FURNITURE DEALER RETURNED TO
THE LATTER THREE QUARTERS OF HIS GOODS KEPT ONLY NECESSARIES AND FOUND
HERSELF WITHOUT WORK WITHOUT A TRADE WITH NOTHING BUT HER BED AND
STILL ABOUT FIFTY FRANCS IN DEBT
SHE BEGAN TO MAKE COARSE SHIRTS FOR SOLDIERS OF THE GARRISON AND EARNED
TWELVE SOUS A DAY
HER DAUGHTER COST HER TEN
IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT
SHE BEGAN TO PAY THE THENARDIERS IRREGULARLY
HOWEVER THE OLD WOMAN WHO LIGHTED HER CANDLE FOR HER WHEN SHE RETURNED
AT NIGHT TAUGHT HER THE ART OF LIVING IN MISERY
BACK OF LIVING ON
LITTLE THERE IS THE LIVING ON NOTHING
THESE ARE THE TWO CHAMBERS THE
FIRST IS DARK THE SECOND IS BLACK
FANTINE LEARNED HOW TO LIVE WITHOUT FIRE ENTIRELY IN THE WINTER HOW TO
GIVE UP A BIRD WHICH EATS A HALF A FARTHING'S WORTH OF MILLET EVERY
TWO DAYS HOW TO MAKE A COVERLET OF ONE'S PETTICOAT AND A PETTICOAT OF
ONE'S COVERLET HOW TO SAVE ONE'S CANDLE BY TAKING ONE'S MEALS BY
THE LIGHT OF THE OPPOSITE WINDOW
NO ONE KNOWS ALL THAT CERTAIN FEEBLE
CREATURES WHO HAVE GROWN OLD IN PRIVATION AND HONESTY CAN GET OUT OF
A SOU
IT ENDS BY BEING A TALENT
FANTINE ACQUIRED THIS SUBLIME TALENT
AND REGAINED A LITTLE COURAGE
AT THIS EPOCH SHE SAID TO A NEIGHBOR BAH I SAY TO MYSELF BY ONLY
SLEEPING FIVE HOURS AND WORKING ALL THE REST OF THE TIME AT MY SEWING
I SHALL ALWAYS MANAGE TO NEARLY EARN MY BREAD
AND THEN WHEN ONE IS
SAD ONE EATS LESS
WELL SUFFERINGS UNEASINESS A LITTLE BREAD ON ONE
HAND TROUBLE ON THE OTHER ALL THIS WILL SUPPORT ME
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT HAPPINESS TO HAVE HER LITTLE GIRL WITH HER IN
THIS DISTRESS
SHE THOUGHT OF HAVING HER COME
BUT WHAT THEN MAKE HER
SHARE HER OWN DESTITUTION AND THEN SHE WAS IN DEBT TO THE THENARDIERS
HOW COULD SHE PAY THEM AND THE JOURNEY HOW PAY FOR THAT
THE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD GIVEN HER LESSONS IN WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE LIFE
OF INDIGENCE WAS A SAINTED SPINSTER NAMED MARGUERITE WHO WAS PIOUS
WITH A TRUE PIETY POOR AND CHARITABLE TOWARDS THE POOR AND EVEN
TOWARDS THE RICH KNOWING HOW TO WRITE JUST SUFFICIENTLY TO SIGN HERSELF
MARGUERITE AND BELIEVING IN GOD WHICH IS SCIENCE
THERE ARE MANY SUCH VIRTUOUS PEOPLE IN THIS LOWER WORLD SOME DAY THEY
WILL BE IN THE WORLD ABOVE
THIS LIFE HAS A MORROW
AT FIRST FANTINE HAD BEEN SO ASHAMED THAT SHE HAD NOT DARED TO GO OUT
WHEN SHE WAS IN THE STREET SHE DIVINED THAT PEOPLE TURNED ROUND BEHIND
HER AND POINTED AT HER EVERY ONE STARED AT HER AND NO ONE GREETED HER
THE COLD AND BITTER SCORN OF THE PASSERS BY PENETRATED HER VERY FLESH
AND SOUL LIKE A NORTH WIND
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN WERE UTTERLY BARE BENEATH THE
SARCASM AND THE CURIOSITY OF ALL IN SMALL TOWNS
IN PARIS AT LEAST NO
ONE KNOWS YOU AND THIS OBSCURITY IS A GARMENT
OH HOW SHE WOULD HAVE
LIKED TO BETAKE HERSELF TO PARIS IMPOSSIBLE
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO ACCUSTOM HERSELF TO DISREPUTE AS SHE HAD ACCUSTOMED
HERSELF TO INDIGENCE
GRADUALLY SHE DECIDED ON HER COURSE
AT THE
EXPIRATION OF TWO OR THREE MONTHS SHE SHOOK OFF HER SHAME AND BEGAN TO
GO ABOUT AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING THE MATTER
IT IS ALL THE SAME TO
ME SHE SAID
SHE WENT AND CAME BEARING HER HEAD WELL UP WITH A BITTER SMILE AND
WAS CONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS BECOMING BRAZEN FACED
MADAME VICTURNIEN SOMETIMES SAW HER PASSING FROM HER WINDOW NOTICED
THE DISTRESS OF THAT CREATURE WHO THANKS TO HER HAD BEEN PUT BACK
IN HER PROPER PLACE AND CONGRATULATED HERSELF
THE HAPPINESS OF THE
EVIL MINDED IS BLACK
EXCESS OF TOIL WORE OUT FANTINE AND THE LITTLE DRY COUGH WHICH TROUBLED
HER INCREASED
SHE SOMETIMES SAID TO HER NEIGHBOR MARGUERITE JUST
FEEL HOW HOT MY HANDS ARE
NEVERTHELESS WHEN SHE COMBED HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR IN THE MORNING WITH
AN OLD BROKEN COMB AND IT FLOWED ABOUT HER LIKE FLOSS SILK SHE
EXPERIENCED A MOMENT OF HAPPY COQUETRY
CHAPTER X RESULT OF THE SUCCESS
SHE HAD BEEN DISMISSED TOWARDS THE END OF THE WINTER THE SUMMER PASSED
BUT WINTER CAME AGAIN
SHORT DAYS LESS WORK
WINTER NO WARMTH
NO LIGHT NO NOONDAY THE EVENING JOINING ON TO THE MORNING FOGS
TWILIGHT THE WINDOW IS GRAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE CLEARLY AT IT
THE
SKY IS BUT A VENT HOLE
THE WHOLE DAY IS A CAVERN
THE SUN HAS THE AIR
OF A BEGGAR
A FRIGHTFUL SEASON WINTER CHANGES THE WATER OF HEAVEN AND
THE HEART OF MAN INTO A STONE
HER CREDITORS HARRASSED HER
FANTINE EARNED TOO LITTLE
HER DEBTS HAD INCREASED
THE THENARDIERS WHO
WERE NOT PROMPTLY PAID WROTE TO HER CONSTANTLY LETTERS WHOSE CONTENTS
DROVE HER TO DESPAIR AND WHOSE CARRIAGE RUINED HER
ONE DAY THEY WROTE
TO HER THAT HER LITTLE COSETTE WAS ENTIRELY NAKED IN THAT COLD WEATHER
THAT SHE NEEDED A WOOLLEN SKIRT AND THAT HER MOTHER MUST SEND AT LEAST
TEN FRANCS FOR THIS
SHE RECEIVED THE LETTER AND CRUSHED IT IN HER
HANDS ALL DAY LONG
THAT EVENING SHE WENT INTO A BARBER'S SHOP AT THE
CORNER OF THE STREET AND PULLED OUT HER COMB
HER ADMIRABLE GOLDEN HAIR
FELL TO HER KNEES
WHAT SPLENDID HAIR EXCLAIMED THE BARBER
HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR IT SAID SHE
TEN FRANCS
CUT IT OFF
SHE PURCHASED A KNITTED PETTICOAT AND SENT IT TO THE THENARDIERS
THIS
PETTICOAT MADE THE THENARDIERS FURIOUS
IT WAS THE MONEY THAT THEY
WANTED
THEY GAVE THE PETTICOAT TO EPONINE
THE POOR LARK CONTINUED TO
SHIVER
FANTINE THOUGHT MY CHILD IS NO LONGER COLD
I HAVE CLOTHED HER WITH MY
HAIR SHE PUT ON LITTLE ROUND CAPS WHICH CONCEALED HER SHORN HEAD AND
IN WHICH SHE WAS STILL PRETTY
DARK THOUGHTS HELD POSSESSION OF FANTINE'S HEART
WHEN SHE SAW THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER DRESS HER HAIR SHE BEGAN TO HATE
EVERY ONE ABOUT HER
SHE HAD LONG SHARED THE UNIVERSAL VENERATION FOR
FATHER MADELEINE YET BY DINT OF REPEATING TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS HE
WHO HAD DISCHARGED HER THAT HE WAS THE CAUSE OF HER UNHAPPINESS SHE
CAME TO HATE HIM ALSO AND MOST OF ALL
WHEN SHE PASSED THE FACTORY IN
WORKING HOURS WHEN THE WORKPEOPLE WERE AT THE DOOR SHE AFFECTED TO
LAUGH AND SING
AN OLD WORKWOMAN WHO ONCE SAW HER LAUGHING AND SINGING IN THIS FASHION
SAID THERE'S A GIRL WHO WILL COME TO A BAD END
SHE TOOK A LOVER THE FIRST WHO OFFERED A MAN WHOM SHE DID NOT LOVE
OUT OF BRAVADO AND WITH RAGE IN HER HEART
HE WAS A MISERABLE SCAMP
A SORT OF MENDICANT MUSICIAN A LAZY BEGGAR WHO BEAT HER AND WHO
ABANDONED HER AS SHE HAD TAKEN HIM IN DISGUST
SHE ADORED HER CHILD
THE LOWER SHE DESCENDED THE DARKER EVERYTHING GREW ABOUT HER THE MORE
RADIANT SHONE THAT LITTLE ANGEL AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART
SHE SAID
WHEN I GET RICH I WILL HAVE MY COSETTE WITH ME AND SHE LAUGHED
HER
COUGH DID NOT LEAVE HER AND SHE HAD SWEATS ON HER BACK
ONE DAY SHE RECEIVED FROM THE THENARDIERS A LETTER COUCHED IN THE
FOLLOWING TERMS COSETTE IS ILL WITH A MALADY WHICH IS GOING THE ROUNDS
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
A MILIARY FEVER THEY CALL IT
EXPENSIVE DRUGS ARE
REQUIRED
THIS IS RUINING US AND WE CAN NO LONGER PAY FOR THEM
IF YOU
DO NOT SEND US FORTY FRANCS BEFORE THE WEEK IS OUT THE LITTLE ONE WILL
BE DEAD
SHE BURST OUT LAUGHING AND SAID TO HER OLD NEIGHBOR AH THEY ARE
GOOD FORTY FRANCS THE IDEA THAT MAKES TWO NAPOLEONS WHERE DO THEY
THINK I AM TO GET THEM THESE PEASANTS ARE STUPID TRULY
NEVERTHELESS SHE WENT TO A DORMER WINDOW IN THE STAIRCASE AND READ THE
LETTER ONCE MORE
THEN SHE DESCENDED THE STAIRS AND EMERGED RUNNING AND
LEAPING AND STILL LAUGHING
SOME ONE MET HER AND SAID TO HER WHAT MAKES YOU SO GAY
SHE REPLIED A FINE PIECE OF STUPIDITY THAT SOME COUNTRY PEOPLE HAVE
WRITTEN TO ME
THEY DEMAND FORTY FRANCS OF ME
SO MUCH FOR YOU YOU
PEASANTS
AS SHE CROSSED THE SQUARE SHE SAW A GREAT MANY PEOPLE COLLECTED AROUND
A CARRIAGE OF ECCENTRIC SHAPE UPON THE TOP OF WHICH STOOD A MAN DRESSED
IN RED WHO WAS HOLDING FORTH
HE WAS A QUACK DENTIST ON HIS ROUNDS
WHO WAS OFFERING TO THE PUBLIC FULL SETS OF TEETH OPIATES POWDERS AND
ELIXIRS
FANTINE MINGLED IN THE GROUP AND BEGAN TO LAUGH WITH THE REST AT
THE HARANGUE WHICH CONTAINED SLANG FOR THE POPULACE AND JARGON FOR
RESPECTABLE PEOPLE
THE TOOTH PULLER ESPIED THE LOVELY LAUGHING GIRL
AND SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL TEETH YOU GIRL THERE WHO
ARE LAUGHING IF YOU WANT TO SELL ME YOUR PALETTES I WILL GIVE YOU A
GOLD NAPOLEON APIECE FOR THEM
WHAT ARE MY PALETTES ASKED FANTINE
THE PALETTES REPLIED THE DENTAL PROFESSOR ARE THE FRONT TEETH THE
TWO UPPER ONES
HOW HORRIBLE EXCLAIMED FANTINE
TWO NAPOLEONS GRUMBLED A TOOTHLESS OLD WOMAN WHO WAS PRESENT
HERE'S
A LUCKY GIRL
FANTINE FLED AND STOPPED HER EARS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HEAR THE HOARSE
VOICE OF THE MAN SHOUTING TO HER REFLECT MY BEAUTY TWO NAPOLEONS
THEY MAY PROVE OF SERVICE
IF YOUR HEART BIDS YOU COME THIS EVENING TO
THE INN OF THE TILLAC D'ARGENT YOU WILL FIND ME THERE
FANTINE RETURNED HOME
SHE WAS FURIOUS AND RELATED THE OCCURRENCE TO
HER GOOD NEIGHBOR MARGUERITE CAN YOU UNDERSTAND SUCH A THING IS HE
NOT AN ABOMINABLE MAN HOW CAN THEY ALLOW SUCH PEOPLE TO GO ABOUT THE
COUNTRY PULL OUT MY TWO FRONT TEETH WHY I SHOULD BE HORRIBLE MY HAIR
WILL GROW AGAIN BUT MY TEETH AH WHAT A MONSTER OF A MAN I SHOULD
PREFER TO THROW MYSELF HEAD FIRST ON THE PAVEMENT FROM THE FIFTH STORY
HE TOLD ME THAT HE SHOULD BE AT THE TILLAC D'ARGENT THIS EVENING
AND WHAT DID HE OFFER ASKED MARGUERITE
TWO NAPOLEONS
THAT MAKES FORTY FRANCS
YES SAID FANTINE THAT MAKES FORTY FRANCS
SHE REMAINED THOUGHTFUL AND BEGAN HER WORK
AT THE EXPIRATION OF A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE LEFT HER SEWING AND WENT TO READ THE THENARDIERS'
LETTER ONCE MORE ON THE STAIRCASE
ON HER RETURN SHE SAID TO MARGUERITE WHO WAS AT WORK BESIDE HER
WHAT IS A MILIARY FEVER DO YOU KNOW
YES ANSWERED THE OLD SPINSTER IT IS A DISEASE
DOES IT REQUIRE MANY DRUGS
OH TERRIBLE DRUGS
HOW DOES ONE GET IT
IT IS A MALADY THAT ONE GETS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW
THEN IT ATTACKS CHILDREN
CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR
DO PEOPLE DIE OF IT
THEY MAY SAID MARGUERITE
FANTINE LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT TO READ HER LETTER ONCE MORE ON THE
STAIRCASE
THAT EVENING SHE WENT OUT AND WAS SEEN TO TURN HER STEPS IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE RUE DE PARIS WHERE THE INNS ARE SITUATED
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN MARGUERITE ENTERED FANTINE'S ROOM BEFORE
DAYLIGHT FOR THEY ALWAYS WORKED TOGETHER AND IN THIS MANNER USED ONLY
ONE CANDLE FOR THE TWO SHE FOUND FANTINE SEATED ON HER BED PALE AND
FROZEN
SHE HAD NOT LAIN DOWN
HER CAP HAD FALLEN ON HER KNEES
HER CANDLE HAD BURNED ALL NIGHT AND WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONSUMED
MARGUERITE HALTED ON THE THRESHOLD PETRIFIED AT THIS TREMENDOUS
WASTEFULNESS AND EXCLAIMED
LORD THE CANDLE IS ALL BURNED OUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
THEN SHE LOOKED AT FANTINE WHO TURNED TOWARD HER HER HEAD BEREFT OF ITS
HAIR
FANTINE HAD GROWN TEN YEARS OLDER SINCE THE PRECEDING NIGHT
JESUS SAID MARGUERITE WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU FANTINE
NOTHING REPLIED FANTINE
QUITE THE CONTRARY
MY CHILD WILL NOT DIE
OF THAT FRIGHTFUL MALADY FOR LACK OF SUCCOR
I AM CONTENT
SO SAYING SHE POINTED OUT TO THE SPINSTER TWO NAPOLEONS WHICH WERE
GLITTERING ON THE TABLE
AH JESUS GOD CRIED MARGUERITE
WHY IT IS A FORTUNE WHERE DID YOU
GET THOSE LOUIS D'OR
I GOT THEM REPLIED FANTINE
AT THE SAME TIME SHE SMILED
THE CANDLE ILLUMINATED HER COUNTENANCE
IT
WAS A BLOODY SMILE
A REDDISH SALIVA SOILED THE CORNERS OF HER LIPS AND
SHE HAD A BLACK HOLE IN HER MOUTH
THE TWO TEETH HAD BEEN EXTRACTED
SHE SENT THE FORTY FRANCS TO MONTFERMEIL
AFTER ALL IT WAS A RUSE OF THE THENARDIERS TO OBTAIN MONEY
COSETTE WAS
NOT ILL
FANTINE THREW HER MIRROR OUT OF THE WINDOW
SHE HAD LONG SINCE QUITTED
HER CELL ON THE SECOND FLOOR FOR AN ATTIC WITH ONLY A LATCH TO FASTEN
IT NEXT THE ROOF ONE OF THOSE ATTICS WHOSE EXTREMITY FORMS AN ANGLE
WITH THE FLOOR AND KNOCKS YOU ON THE HEAD EVERY INSTANT
THE POOR
OCCUPANT CAN REACH THE END OF HIS CHAMBER AS HE CAN THE END OF HIS
DESTINY ONLY BY BENDING OVER MORE AND MORE
SHE HAD NO LONGER A BED A RAG WHICH SHE CALLED HER COVERLET A MATTRESS
ON THE FLOOR AND A SEATLESS CHAIR STILL REMAINED
A LITTLE ROSEBUSH
WHICH SHE HAD HAD DRIED UP FORGOTTEN IN ONE CORNER
IN THE OTHER
CORNER WAS A BUTTER POT TO HOLD WATER WHICH FROZE IN WINTER AND IN
WHICH THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF THE WATER REMAINED LONG MARKED BY THESE
CIRCLES OF ICE
SHE HAD LOST HER SHAME SHE LOST HER COQUETRY
A FINAL
SIGN
SHE WENT OUT WITH DIRTY CAPS
WHETHER FROM LACK OF TIME OR FROM
INDIFFERENCE SHE NO LONGER MENDED HER LINEN
AS THE HEELS WORE OUT
SHE DRAGGED HER STOCKINGS DOWN INTO HER SHOES
THIS WAS EVIDENT FROM THE
PERPENDICULAR WRINKLES
SHE PATCHED HER BODICE WHICH WAS OLD AND WORN
OUT WITH SCRAPS OF CALICO WHICH TORE AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT
THE
PEOPLE TO WHOM SHE WAS INDEBTED MADE SCENES AND GAVE HER NO PEACE
SHE FOUND THEM IN THE STREET SHE FOUND THEM AGAIN ON HER STAIRCASE
SHE
PASSED MANY A NIGHT WEEPING AND THINKING
HER EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT
AND SHE FELT A STEADY PAIN IN HER SHOULDER TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE
LEFT SHOULDER BLADE
SHE COUGHED A GREAT DEAL
SHE DEEPLY HATED FATHER
MADELEINE BUT MADE NO COMPLAINT
SHE SEWED SEVENTEEN HOURS A DAY BUT
A CONTRACTOR FOR THE WORK OF PRISONS WHO MADE THE PRISONERS WORK AT A
DISCOUNT SUDDENLY MADE PRICES FALL WHICH REDUCED THE DAILY EARNINGS
OF WORKING WOMEN TO NINE SOUS
SEVENTEEN HOURS OF TOIL AND NINE SOUS A
DAY HER CREDITORS WERE MORE PITILESS THAN EVER
THE SECOND HAND DEALER
WHO HAD TAKEN BACK NEARLY ALL HIS FURNITURE SAID TO HER INCESSANTLY
WHEN WILL YOU PAY ME YOU HUSSY WHAT DID THEY WANT OF HER GOOD GOD
SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS BEING HUNTED AND SOMETHING OF THE WILD BEAST
DEVELOPED IN HER
ABOUT THE SAME TIME THENARDIER WROTE TO HER THAT HE
HAD WAITED WITH DECIDEDLY TOO MUCH AMIABILITY AND THAT HE MUST HAVE A
HUNDRED FRANCS AT ONCE OTHERWISE HE WOULD TURN LITTLE COSETTE OUT OF
DOORS CONVALESCENT AS SHE WAS FROM HER HEAVY ILLNESS INTO THE COLD AND
THE STREETS AND THAT SHE MIGHT DO WHAT SHE LIKED WITH HERSELF AND DIE
IF SHE CHOSE
A HUNDRED FRANCS THOUGHT FANTINE
BUT IN WHAT TRADE
CAN ONE EARN A HUNDRED SOUS A DAY
COME SAID SHE LET US SELL WHAT IS LEFT
THE UNFORTUNATE GIRL BECAME A WOMAN OF THE TOWN
CHAPTER XI CHRISTUS NOS LIBERAVIT
WHAT IS THIS HISTORY OF FANTINE IT IS SOCIETY PURCHASING A SLAVE
FROM WHOM FROM MISERY
FROM HUNGER COLD ISOLATION DESTITUTION
A DOLOROUS BARGAIN
A SOUL
FOR A MORSEL OF BREAD
MISERY OFFERS SOCIETY ACCEPTS
THE SACRED LAW OF JESUS CHRIST GOVERNS OUR CIVILIZATION BUT IT DOES
NOT AS YET PERMEATE IT IT IS SAID THAT SLAVERY HAS DISAPPEARED FROM
EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION
THIS IS A MISTAKE
IT STILL EXISTS BUT IT WEIGHS
ONLY UPON THE WOMAN AND IT IS CALLED PROSTITUTION
IT WEIGHS UPON THE WOMAN THAT IS TO SAY UPON GRACE WEAKNESS BEAUTY
MATERNITY
THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE LEAST OF MAN'S DISGRACES
AT THE POINT IN THIS MELANCHOLY DRAMA WHICH WE HAVE NOW REACHED NOTHING
IS LEFT TO FANTINE OF THAT WHICH SHE HAD FORMERLY BEEN
SHE HAS BECOME MARBLE IN BECOMING MIRE
WHOEVER TOUCHES HER FEELS COLD
SHE PASSES SHE ENDURES YOU SHE IGNORES YOU SHE IS THE SEVERE AND
DISHONORED FIGURE
LIFE AND THE SOCIAL ORDER HAVE SAID THEIR LAST WORD
FOR HER
ALL HAS HAPPENED TO HER THAT WILL HAPPEN TO HER
SHE HAS
FELT EVERYTHING BORNE EVERYTHING EXPERIENCED EVERYTHING SUFFERED
EVERYTHING LOST EVERYTHING MOURNED EVERYTHING
SHE IS RESIGNED WITH
THAT RESIGNATION WHICH RESEMBLES INDIFFERENCE AS DEATH RESEMBLES SLEEP
SHE NO LONGER AVOIDS ANYTHING
LET ALL THE CLOUDS FALL UPON HER AND ALL
THE OCEAN SWEEP OVER HER WHAT MATTERS IT TO HER SHE IS A SPONGE THAT
IS SOAKED
AT LEAST SHE BELIEVES IT TO BE SO BUT IT IS AN ERROR TO IMAGINE THAT
FATE CAN BE EXHAUSTED AND THAT ONE HAS REACHED THE BOTTOM OF ANYTHING
WHATEVER
ALAS WHAT ARE ALL THESE FATES DRIVEN ON PELL MELL WHITHER ARE THEY
GOING WHY ARE THEY THUS
HE WHO KNOWS THAT SEES THE WHOLE OF THE SHADOW
HE IS ALONE
HIS NAME IS GOD
CHAPTER XII M
BAMATABOIS'S INACTIVITY
THERE IS IN ALL SMALL TOWNS AND THERE WAS AT M
SUR M
IN PARTICULAR
A CLASS OF YOUNG MEN WHO NIBBLE AWAY AN INCOME OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED
FRANCS WITH THE SAME AIR WITH WHICH THEIR PROTOTYPES DEVOUR TWO HUNDRED
THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR IN PARIS
THESE ARE BEINGS OF THE GREAT NEUTER
SPECIES IMPOTENT MEN PARASITES CYPHERS WHO HAVE A LITTLE LAND A
LITTLE FOLLY A LITTLE WIT WHO WOULD BE RUSTICS IN A DRAWING ROOM AND
WHO THINK THEMSELVES GENTLEMEN IN THE DRAM SHOP WHO SAY MY FIELDS
MY PEASANTS MY WOODS WHO HISS ACTRESSES AT THE THEATRE TO PROVE THAT
THEY ARE PERSONS OF TASTE QUARREL WITH THE OFFICERS OF THE GARRISON
TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE MEN OF WAR HUNT SMOKE YAWN DRINK SMELL OF
TOBACCO PLAY BILLIARDS STARE AT TRAVELLERS AS THEY DESCEND FROM THE
DILIGENCE LIVE AT THE CAFE DINE AT THE INN HAVE A DOG WHICH EATS THE
BONES UNDER THE TABLE AND A MISTRESS WHO EATS THE DISHES ON THE TABLE
WHO STICK AT A SOU EXAGGERATE THE FASHIONS ADMIRE TRAGEDY DESPISE
WOMEN WEAR OUT THEIR OLD BOOTS COPY LONDON THROUGH PARIS AND PARIS
THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF PONT A MOUSSON GROW OLD AS DULLARDS NEVER WORK
SERVE NO USE AND DO NO GREAT HARM
M
FELIX THOLOMYES HAD HE REMAINED IN HIS OWN PROVINCE AND NEVER BEHELD
PARIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THESE MEN
IF THEY WERE RICHER ONE WOULD SAY THEY ARE DANDIES IF THEY WERE
POORER ONE WOULD SAY THEY ARE IDLERS THEY ARE SIMPLY MEN WITHOUT
EMPLOYMENT
AMONG THESE UNEMPLOYED THERE ARE BORES THE BORED DREAMERS
AND SOME KNAVES
AT THAT PERIOD A DANDY WAS COMPOSED OF A TALL COLLAR A BIG CRAVAT A
WATCH WITH TRINKETS THREE VESTS OF DIFFERENT COLORS WORN ONE ON TOP OF
THE OTHER THE RED AND BLUE INSIDE OF A SHORT WAISTED OLIVE COAT WITH
A CODFISH TAIL A DOUBLE ROW OF SILVER BUTTONS SET CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
AND RUNNING UP TO THE SHOULDER AND A PAIR OF TROUSERS OF A LIGHTER
SHADE OF OLIVE ORNAMENTED ON THE TWO SEAMS WITH AN INDEFINITE BUT
ALWAYS UNEVEN NUMBER OF LINES VARYING FROM ONE TO ELEVEN A LIMIT
WHICH WAS NEVER EXCEEDED
ADD TO THIS HIGH SHOES WITH LITTLE IRONS
ON THE HEELS A TALL HAT WITH A NARROW BRIM HAIR WORN IN A TUFT AN
ENORMOUS CANE AND CONVERSATION SET OFF BY PUNS OF POTIER
OVER ALL
SPURS AND A MUSTACHE
AT THAT EPOCH MUSTACHES INDICATED THE BOURGEOIS
AND SPURS THE PEDESTRIAN
THE PROVINCIAL DANDY WORE THE LONGEST OF SPURS AND THE FIERCEST OF
MUSTACHES
IT WAS THE PERIOD OF THE CONFLICT OF THE REPUBLICS OF SOUTH AMERICA WITH
THE KING OF SPAIN OF BOLIVAR AGAINST MORILLO
NARROW BRIMMED HATS WERE
ROYALIST AND WERE CALLED MORILLOS LIBERALS WORE HATS WITH WIDE BRIMS
WHICH WERE CALLED BOLIVARS
EIGHT OR TEN MONTHS THEN AFTER THAT WHICH IS RELATED IN THE PRECEDING
PAGES TOWARDS THE FIRST OF JANUARY 1823 ON A SNOWY EVENING ONE OF
THESE DANDIES ONE OF THESE UNEMPLOYED A RIGHT THINKER FOR HE WORE
A MORILLO AND WAS MOREOVER WARMLY ENVELOPED IN ONE OF THOSE LARGE
CLOAKS WHICH COMPLETED THE FASHIONABLE COSTUME IN COLD WEATHER WAS
AMUSING HIMSELF BY TORMENTING A CREATURE WHO WAS PROWLING ABOUT IN A
BALL DRESS WITH NECK UNCOVERED AND FLOWERS IN HER HAIR IN FRONT OF
THE OFFICERS' CAFE
THIS DANDY WAS SMOKING FOR HE WAS DECIDEDLY
FASHIONABLE
EACH TIME THAT THE WOMAN PASSED IN FRONT OF HIM HE BESTOWED ON HER
TOGETHER WITH A PUFF FROM HIS CIGAR SOME APOSTROPHE WHICH HE CONSIDERED
WITTY AND MIRTHFUL SUCH AS HOW UGLY YOU ARE WILL YOU GET OUT OF MY
SIGHT YOU HAVE NO TEETH ETC ETC
THIS GENTLEMAN WAS KNOWN AS M
BAMATABOIS
THE WOMAN A MELANCHOLY DECORATED SPECTRE WHICH WENT AND
CAME THROUGH THE SNOW MADE HIM NO REPLY DID NOT EVEN GLANCE AT HIM
AND NEVERTHELESS CONTINUED HER PROMENADE IN SILENCE AND WITH A SOMBRE
REGULARITY WHICH BROUGHT HER EVERY FIVE MINUTES WITHIN REACH OF THIS
SARCASM LIKE THE CONDEMNED SOLDIER WHO RETURNS UNDER THE RODS
THE
SMALL EFFECT WHICH HE PRODUCED NO DOUBT PIQUED THE LOUNGER AND TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN HER BACK WAS TURNED HE CREPT UP BEHIND HER
WITH THE GAIT OF A WOLF AND STIFLING HIS LAUGH BENT DOWN PICKED UP A
HANDFUL OF SNOW FROM THE PAVEMENT AND THRUST IT ABRUPTLY INTO HER BACK
BETWEEN HER BARE SHOULDERS
THE WOMAN UTTERED A ROAR WHIRLED ROUND
GAVE A LEAP LIKE A PANTHER AND HURLED HERSELF UPON THE MAN BURYING HER
NAILS IN HIS FACE WITH THE MOST FRIGHTFUL WORDS WHICH COULD FALL FROM
THE GUARD ROOM INTO THE GUTTER
THESE INSULTS POURED FORTH IN A VOICE
ROUGHENED BY BRANDY DID INDEED PROCEED IN HIDEOUS WISE FROM A MOUTH
WHICH LACKED ITS TWO FRONT TEETH
IT WAS FANTINE
AT THE NOISE THUS PRODUCED THE OFFICERS RAN OUT IN THRONGS FROM THE
CAFE PASSERS BY COLLECTED AND A LARGE AND MERRY CIRCLE HOOTING AND
APPLAUDING WAS FORMED AROUND THIS WHIRLWIND COMPOSED OF TWO BEINGS
WHOM THERE WAS SOME DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNIZING AS A MAN AND A WOMAN THE
MAN STRUGGLING HIS HAT ON THE GROUND THE WOMAN STRIKING OUT WITH FEET
AND FISTS BAREHEADED HOWLING MINUS HAIR AND TEETH LIVID WITH WRATH
HORRIBLE
SUDDENLY A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE EMERGED VIVACIOUSLY FROM THE CROWD
SEIZED THE WOMAN BY HER SATIN BODICE WHICH WAS COVERED WITH MUD AND
SAID TO HER FOLLOW ME
THE WOMAN RAISED HER HEAD HER FURIOUS VOICE SUDDENLY DIED AWAY
HER
EYES WERE GLASSY SHE TURNED PALE INSTEAD OF LIVID AND SHE TREMBLED
WITH A QUIVER OF TERROR
SHE HAD RECOGNIZED JAVERT
THE DANDY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE INCIDENT TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
CHAPTER XIII THE SOLUTION OF SOME QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE
MUNICIPAL POLICE
JAVERT THRUST ASIDE THE SPECTATORS BROKE THE CIRCLE AND SET OUT
WITH LONG STRIDES TOWARDS THE POLICE STATION WHICH IS SITUATED AT THE
EXTREMITY OF THE SQUARE DRAGGING THE WRETCHED WOMAN AFTER HIM
SHE
YIELDED MECHANICALLY
NEITHER HE NOR SHE UTTERED A WORD
THE CLOUD OF
SPECTATORS FOLLOWED JESTING IN A PAROXYSM OF DELIGHT
SUPREME MISERY
AN OCCASION FOR OBSCENITY
ON ARRIVING AT THE POLICE STATION WHICH WAS A LOW ROOM WARMED BY A
STOVE WITH A GLAZED AND GRATED DOOR OPENING ON THE STREET AND GUARDED
BY A DETACHMENT JAVERT OPENED THE DOOR ENTERED WITH FANTINE AND SHUT
THE DOOR BEHIND HIM TO THE GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE CURIOUS WHO
RAISED THEMSELVES ON TIPTOE AND CRANED THEIR NECKS IN FRONT OF THE
THICK GLASS OF THE STATION HOUSE IN THEIR EFFORT TO SEE
CURIOSITY IS A
SORT OF GLUTTONY
TO SEE IS TO DEVOUR
ON ENTERING FANTINE FELL DOWN IN A CORNER MOTIONLESS AND MUTE
CROUCHING DOWN LIKE A TERRIFIED DOG
THE SERGEANT OF THE GUARD BROUGHT A LIGHTED CANDLE TO THE TABLE
JAVERT
SEATED HIMSELF DREW A SHEET OF STAMPED PAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND BEGAN
TO WRITE
THIS CLASS OF WOMEN IS CONSIGNED BY OUR LAWS ENTIRELY TO THE DISCRETION
OF THE POLICE
THE LATTER DO WHAT THEY PLEASE PUNISH THEM AS SEEMS
GOOD TO THEM AND CONFISCATE AT THEIR WILL THOSE TWO SORRY THINGS WHICH
THEY ENTITLE THEIR INDUSTRY AND THEIR LIBERTY
JAVERT WAS IMPASSIVE HIS
GRAVE FACE BETRAYED NO EMOTION WHATEVER
NEVERTHELESS HE WAS SERIOUSLY
AND DEEPLY PREOCCUPIED
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHEN HE WAS
EXERCISING WITHOUT CONTROL BUT SUBJECT TO ALL THE SCRUPLES OF A SEVERE
CONSCIENCE HIS REDOUBTABLE DISCRETIONARY POWER
AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS
CONSCIOUS THAT HIS POLICE AGENT'S STOOL WAS A TRIBUNAL
HE WAS ENTERING
JUDGMENT
HE JUDGED AND CONDEMNED
HE SUMMONED ALL THE IDEAS WHICH COULD
POSSIBLY EXIST IN HIS MIND AROUND THE GREAT THING WHICH HE WAS DOING
THE MORE HE EXAMINED THE DEED OF THIS WOMAN THE MORE SHOCKED HE FELT
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD JUST WITNESSED THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME
HE HAD JUST BEHELD YONDER IN THE STREET SOCIETY IN THE PERSON OF A
FREEHOLDER AND AN ELECTOR INSULTED AND ATTACKED BY A CREATURE WHO WAS
OUTSIDE ALL PALES
A PROSTITUTE HAD MADE AN ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF A
CITIZEN
HE HAD SEEN THAT HE JAVERT
HE WROTE IN SILENCE
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HE SIGNED THE PAPER FOLDED IT AND SAID TO THE
SERGEANT OF THE GUARD AS HE HANDED IT TO HIM TAKE THREE MEN AND
CONDUCT THIS CREATURE TO JAIL
THEN TURNING TO FANTINE YOU ARE TO HAVE SIX MONTHS OF IT THE
UNHAPPY WOMAN SHUDDERED
SIX MONTHS SIX MONTHS OF PRISON SHE EXCLAIMED
SIX MONTHS IN WHICH
TO EARN SEVEN SOUS A DAY BUT WHAT WILL BECOME OF COSETTE MY DAUGHTER
MY DAUGHTER BUT I STILL OWE THE THENARDIERS OVER A HUNDRED FRANCS DO
YOU KNOW THAT MONSIEUR INSPECTOR
SHE DRAGGED HERSELF ACROSS THE DAMP FLOOR AMONG THE MUDDY BOOTS OF ALL
THOSE MEN WITHOUT RISING WITH CLASPED HANDS AND TAKING GREAT STRIDES
ON HER KNEES
MONSIEUR JAVERT SAID SHE I BESEECH YOUR MERCY
I ASSURE YOU THAT
I WAS NOT IN THE WRONG
IF YOU HAD SEEN THE BEGINNING YOU WOULD HAVE
SEEN
I SWEAR TO YOU BY THE GOOD GOD THAT I WAS NOT TO BLAME THAT
GENTLEMAN THE BOURGEOIS WHOM I DO NOT KNOW PUT SNOW IN MY BACK
HAS
ANY ONE THE RIGHT TO PUT SNOW DOWN OUR BACKS WHEN WE ARE WALKING ALONG
PEACEABLY AND DOING NO HARM TO ANY ONE I AM RATHER ILL AS YOU SEE
AND THEN HE HAD BEEN SAYING IMPERTINENT THINGS TO ME FOR A LONG TIME
'YOU ARE UGLY YOU HAVE NO TEETH I KNOW WELL THAT I HAVE NO LONGER
THOSE TEETH
I DID NOTHING I SAID TO MYSELF 'THE GENTLEMAN IS AMUSING
HIMSELF I WAS HONEST WITH HIM I DID NOT SPEAK TO HIM
IT WAS AT THAT
MOMENT THAT HE PUT THE SNOW DOWN MY BACK
MONSIEUR JAVERT GOOD MONSIEUR
INSPECTOR IS THERE NOT SOME PERSON HERE WHO SAW IT AND CAN TELL YOU
THAT THIS IS QUITE TRUE PERHAPS I DID WRONG TO GET ANGRY
YOU KNOW THAT
ONE IS NOT MASTER OF ONE'S SELF AT THE FIRST MOMENT
ONE GIVES WAY TO
VIVACITY AND THEN WHEN SOME ONE PUTS SOMETHING COLD DOWN YOUR
BACK JUST WHEN YOU ARE NOT EXPECTING IT I DID WRONG TO SPOIL THAT
GENTLEMAN'S HAT
WHY DID HE GO AWAY I WOULD ASK HIS PARDON
OH MY GOD
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME WHETHER I ASK HIS PARDON
DO ME THE FAVOR
TO DAY FOR THIS ONCE MONSIEUR JAVERT
HOLD YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT IN
PRISON ONE CAN EARN ONLY SEVEN SOUS A DAY IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S
FAULT BUT SEVEN SOUS IS ONE'S EARNINGS AND JUST FANCY I MUST PAY
ONE HUNDRED FRANCS OR MY LITTLE GIRL WILL BE SENT TO ME
OH MY GOD
I CANNOT HAVE HER WITH ME
WHAT I DO IS SO VILE OH MY COSETTE OH MY
LITTLE ANGEL OF THE HOLY VIRGIN WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER POOR CREATURE
I WILL TELL YOU IT IS THE THENARDIERS INN KEEPERS PEASANTS AND SUCH
PEOPLE ARE UNREASONABLE
THEY WANT MONEY
DON'T PUT ME IN PRISON YOU
SEE THERE IS A LITTLE GIRL WHO WILL BE TURNED OUT INTO THE STREET TO
GET ALONG AS BEST SHE MAY IN THE VERY HEART OF THE WINTER AND YOU MUST
HAVE PITY ON SUCH A BEING MY GOOD MONSIEUR JAVERT
IF SHE WERE OLDER
SHE MIGHT EARN HER LIVING BUT IT CANNOT BE DONE AT THAT AGE
I AM NOT A
BAD WOMAN AT BOTTOM
IT IS NOT COWARDLINESS AND GLUTTONY THAT HAVE MADE
ME WHAT I AM
IF I HAVE DRUNK BRANDY IT WAS OUT OF MISERY
I DO NOT
LOVE IT BUT IT BENUMBS THE SENSES
WHEN I WAS HAPPY IT WAS ONLY
NECESSARY TO GLANCE INTO MY CLOSETS AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVIDENT THAT
I WAS NOT A COQUETTISH AND UNTIDY WOMAN
I HAD LINEN A GREAT DEAL OF
LINEN
HAVE PITY ON ME MONSIEUR JAVERT
SHE SPOKE THUS RENT IN TWAIN SHAKEN WITH SOBS BLINDED WITH TEARS
HER NECK BARE WRINGING HER HANDS AND COUGHING WITH A DRY SHORT COUGH
STAMMERING SOFTLY WITH A VOICE OF AGONY
GREAT SORROW IS A DIVINE AND
TERRIBLE RAY WHICH TRANSFIGURES THE UNHAPPY
AT THAT MOMENT FANTINE HAD
BECOME BEAUTIFUL ONCE MORE
FROM TIME TO TIME SHE PAUSED AND TENDERLY
KISSED THE POLICE AGENT'S COAT
SHE WOULD HAVE SOFTENED A HEART OF
GRANITE BUT A HEART OF WOOD CANNOT BE SOFTENED
COME SAID JAVERT I HAVE HEARD YOU OUT
HAVE YOU ENTIRELY FINISHED
YOU WILL GET SIX MONTHS
NOW MARCH THE ETERNAL FATHER IN PERSON COULD
DO NOTHING MORE
AT THESE SOLEMN WORDS THE ETERNAL FATHER IN PERSON COULD DO NOTHING
MORE SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT HER FATE WAS SEALED
SHE SANK DOWN
MURMURING MERCY
JAVERT TURNED HIS BACK
THE SOLDIERS SEIZED HER BY THE ARMS
A FEW MOMENTS EARLIER A MAN HAD ENTERED BUT NO ONE HAD PAID ANY HEED
TO HIM
HE SHUT THE DOOR LEANED HIS BACK AGAINST IT AND LISTENED TO
FANTINE'S DESPAIRING SUPPLICATIONS
AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SOLDIERS LAID THEIR HANDS UPON THE UNFORTUNATE
WOMAN WHO WOULD NOT RISE HE EMERGED FROM THE SHADOW AND SAID
ONE MOMENT IF YOU PLEASE
JAVERT RAISED HIS EYES AND RECOGNIZED M
MADELEINE
HE REMOVED HIS HAT
AND SALUTING HIM WITH A SORT OF AGGRIEVED AWKWARDNESS
EXCUSE ME MR
MAYOR
THE WORDS MR
MAYOR PRODUCED A CURIOUS EFFECT UPON FANTINE
SHE ROSE
TO HER FEET WITH ONE BOUND LIKE A SPECTRE SPRINGING FROM THE EARTH
THRUST ASIDE THE SOLDIERS WITH BOTH ARMS WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO M
MADELEINE BEFORE ANY ONE COULD PREVENT HER AND GAZING INTENTLY AT HIM
WITH A BEWILDERED AIR SHE CRIED
AH SO IT IS YOU WHO ARE M
LE MAIRE
THEN SHE BURST INTO A LAUGH AND SPIT IN HIS FACE
M
MADELEINE WIPED HIS FACE AND SAID
INSPECTOR JAVERT SET THIS WOMAN AT LIBERTY
JAVERT FELT THAT HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF GOING MAD
HE EXPERIENCED AT
THAT MOMENT BLOW UPON BLOW AND ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY THE MOST VIOLENT
EMOTIONS WHICH HE HAD EVER UNDERGONE IN ALL HIS LIFE
TO SEE A WOMAN OF
THE TOWN SPIT IN THE MAYOR'S FACE WAS A THING SO MONSTROUS THAT IN HIS
MOST DARING FLIGHTS OF FANCY HE WOULD HAVE REGARDED IT AS A SACRILEGE
TO BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE
ON THE OTHER HAND AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS
THOUGHT HE MADE A HIDEOUS COMPARISON AS TO WHAT THIS WOMAN WAS AND AS
TO WHAT THIS MAYOR MIGHT BE AND THEN HE WITH HORROR CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
OF I KNOW NOT WHAT SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THIS PRODIGIOUS ATTACK
BUT
WHEN HE BEHELD THAT MAYOR THAT MAGISTRATE CALMLY WIPE HIS FACE AND
SAY SET THIS WOMAN AT LIBERTY HE UNDERWENT A SORT OF INTOXICATION
OF AMAZEMENT THOUGHT AND WORD FAILED HIM EQUALLY THE SUM TOTAL OF
POSSIBLE ASTONISHMENT HAD BEEN EXCEEDED IN HIS CASE
HE REMAINED MUTE
THE WORDS HAD PRODUCED NO LESS STRANGE AN EFFECT ON FANTINE
SHE RAISED
HER BARE ARM AND CLUNG TO THE DAMPER OF THE STOVE LIKE A PERSON WHO
IS REELING
NEVERTHELESS SHE GLANCED ABOUT HER AND BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A
LOW VOICE AS THOUGH TALKING TO HERSELF
AT LIBERTY I AM TO BE ALLOWED TO GO I AM NOT TO GO TO PRISON FOR SIX
MONTHS WHO SAID THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT ANY ONE COULD HAVE SAID
THAT
I DID NOT HEAR ARIGHT
IT CANNOT HAVE BEEN THAT MONSTER OF A
MAYOR WAS IT YOU MY GOOD MONSIEUR JAVERT WHO SAID THAT I WAS TO BE
SET FREE OH SEE HERE I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT AND YOU WILL LET ME
GO
THAT MONSTER OF A MAYOR THAT OLD BLACKGUARD OF A MAYOR IS THE
CAUSE OF ALL
JUST IMAGINE MONSIEUR JAVERT HE TURNED ME OUT ALL
BECAUSE OF A PACK OF RASCALLY WOMEN WHO GOSSIP IN THE WORKROOM
IF THAT
IS NOT A HORROR WHAT IS TO DISMISS A POOR GIRL WHO IS DOING HER
WORK HONESTLY THEN I COULD NO LONGER EARN ENOUGH AND ALL THIS MISERY
FOLLOWED
IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS ONE IMPROVEMENT WHICH THESE
GENTLEMEN OF THE POLICE OUGHT TO MAKE AND THAT IS TO PREVENT PRISON
CONTRACTORS FROM WRONGING POOR PEOPLE
I WILL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU YOU
SEE YOU ARE EARNING TWELVE SOUS AT SHIRT MAKING THE PRICE FALLS TO
NINE SOUS AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO LIVE ON
THEN ONE HAS TO BECOME
WHATEVER ONE CAN
AS FOR ME I HAD MY LITTLE COSETTE AND I WAS ACTUALLY
FORCED TO BECOME A BAD WOMAN
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT THAT
BLACKGUARD OF A MAYOR CAUSED ALL THE MISCHIEF
AFTER THAT I STAMPED ON
THAT GENTLEMAN'S HAT IN FRONT OF THE OFFICERS' CAFE BUT HE HAD SPOILED
MY WHOLE DRESS WITH SNOW
WE WOMEN HAVE BUT ONE SILK DRESS FOR EVENING
WEAR
YOU SEE THAT I DID NOT DO WRONG DELIBERATELY TRULY MONSIEUR
JAVERT AND EVERYWHERE I BEHOLD WOMEN WHO ARE FAR MORE WICKED THAN I
AND WHO ARE MUCH HAPPIER
O MONSIEUR JAVERT IT WAS YOU WHO GAVE ORDERS
THAT I AM TO BE SET FREE WAS IT NOT MAKE INQUIRIES SPEAK TO MY
LANDLORD I AM PAYING MY RENT NOW THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT I AM
PERFECTLY HONEST
AH MY GOD I BEG YOUR PARDON I HAVE UNINTENTIONALLY
TOUCHED THE DAMPER OF THE STOVE AND IT HAS MADE IT SMOKE
M
MADELEINE LISTENED TO HER WITH PROFOUND ATTENTION
WHILE SHE WAS
SPEAKING HE FUMBLED IN HIS WAISTCOAT DREW OUT HIS PURSE AND OPENED
IT
IT WAS EMPTY
HE PUT IT BACK IN HIS POCKET
HE SAID TO FANTINE HOW
MUCH DID YOU SAY THAT YOU OWED
FANTINE WHO WAS LOOKING AT JAVERT ONLY TURNED TOWARDS HIM
WAS I SPEAKING TO YOU
THEN ADDRESSING THE SOLDIERS
SAY YOU FELLOWS DID YOU SEE HOW I SPIT IN HIS FACE AH YOU OLD
WRETCH OF A MAYOR YOU CAME HERE TO FRIGHTEN ME BUT I'M NOT AFRAID OF
YOU
I AM AFRAID OF MONSIEUR JAVERT
I AM AFRAID OF MY GOOD MONSIEUR
JAVERT
SO SAYING SHE TURNED TO THE INSPECTOR AGAIN
AND YET YOU SEE MR
INSPECTOR IT IS NECESSARY TO BE JUST
I
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE JUST MR
INSPECTOR IN FACT IT IS PERFECTLY
SIMPLE A MAN AMUSES HIMSELF BY PUTTING SNOW DOWN A WOMAN'S BACK AND
THAT MAKES THE OFFICERS LAUGH ONE MUST DIVERT THEMSELVES IN SOME WAY
AND WE WELL WE ARE HERE FOR THEM TO AMUSE THEMSELVES WITH OF COURSE
AND THEN YOU YOU COME YOU ARE CERTAINLY OBLIGED TO PRESERVE ORDER
YOU LEAD OFF THE WOMAN WHO IS IN THE WRONG BUT ON REFLECTION SINCE YOU
ARE A GOOD MAN YOU SAY THAT I AM TO BE SET AT LIBERTY IT IS FOR
THE SAKE OF THE LITTLE ONE FOR SIX MONTHS IN PRISON WOULD PREVENT MY
SUPPORTING MY CHILD
'ONLY DON'T DO IT AGAIN YOU HUSSY OH I WON'T
DO IT AGAIN MONSIEUR JAVERT THEY MAY DO WHATEVER THEY PLEASE TO ME
NOW I WILL NOT STIR
BUT TO DAY YOU SEE I CRIED BECAUSE IT HURT ME
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT SNOW FROM THE GENTLEMAN AT ALL AND THEN AS I
TOLD YOU I AM NOT WELL I HAVE A COUGH I SEEM TO HAVE A BURNING BALL
IN MY STOMACH AND THE DOCTOR TELLS ME 'TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF HERE
FEEL GIVE ME YOUR HAND DON'T BE AFRAID IT IS HERE
SHE NO LONGER WEPT HER VOICE WAS CARESSING SHE PLACED JAVERT'S COARSE
HAND ON HER DELICATE WHITE THROAT AND LOOKED SMILINGLY AT HIM
ALL AT ONCE SHE RAPIDLY ADJUSTED HER DISORDERED GARMENTS DROPPED THE
FOLDS OF HER SKIRT WHICH HAD BEEN PUSHED UP AS SHE DRAGGED HERSELF
ALONG ALMOST TO THE HEIGHT OF HER KNEE AND STEPPED TOWARDS THE DOOR
SAYING TO THE SOLDIERS IN A LOW VOICE AND WITH A FRIENDLY NOD
CHILDREN MONSIEUR L'INSPECTEUR HAS SAID THAT I AM TO BE RELEASED AND
I AM GOING
SHE LAID HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE DOOR
ONE STEP MORE AND SHE WOULD
BE IN THE STREET
JAVERT UP TO THAT MOMENT HAD REMAINED ERECT MOTIONLESS WITH HIS EYES
FIXED ON THE GROUND CAST ATHWART THIS SCENE LIKE SOME DISPLACED STATUE
WHICH IS WAITING TO BE PUT AWAY SOMEWHERE
THE SOUND OF THE LATCH ROUSED HIM
HE RAISED HIS HEAD WITH AN EXPRESSION
OF SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY AN EXPRESSION ALL THE MORE ALARMING IN
PROPORTION AS THE AUTHORITY RESTS ON A LOW LEVEL FEROCIOUS IN THE WILD
BEAST ATROCIOUS IN THE MAN OF NO ESTATE
SERGEANT HE CRIED DON'T YOU SEE THAT THAT JADE IS WALKING OFF WHO
BADE YOU LET HER GO
I SAID MADELEINE
FANTINE TREMBLED AT THE SOUND OF JAVERT'S VOICE AND LET GO OF THE LATCH
AS A THIEF RELINQUISHES THE ARTICLE WHICH HE HAS STOLEN
AT THE SOUND
OF MADELEINE'S VOICE SHE TURNED AROUND AND FROM THAT MOMENT FORTH SHE
UTTERED NO WORD NOR DARED SO MUCH AS TO BREATHE FREELY BUT HER GLANCE
STRAYED FROM MADELEINE TO JAVERT AND FROM JAVERT TO MADELEINE IN TURN
ACCORDING TO WHICH WAS SPEAKING
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT JAVERT MUST HAVE BEEN EXASPERATED BEYOND MEASURE
BEFORE HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF TO APOSTROPHIZE THE SERGEANT AS HE
HAD DONE AFTER THE MAYOR'S SUGGESTION THAT FANTINE SHOULD BE SET AT
LIBERTY
HAD HE REACHED THE POINT OF FORGETTING THE MAYOR'S PRESENCE
HAD HE FINALLY DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY
AUTHORITY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN SUCH AN ORDER AND THAT THE MAYOR MUST
CERTAINLY HAVE SAID ONE THING BY MISTAKE FOR ANOTHER WITHOUT INTENDING
IT OR IN VIEW OF THE ENORMITIES OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN A WITNESS FOR THE
PAST TWO HOURS DID HE SAY TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO RECUR TO
SUPREME RESOLUTIONS THAT IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE SMALL SHOULD
BE MADE GREAT THAT THE POLICE SPY SHOULD TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO A
MAGISTRATE THAT THE POLICEMAN SHOULD BECOME A DISPENSER OF JUSTICE AND
THAT IN THIS PRODIGIOUS EXTREMITY ORDER LAW MORALITY GOVERNMENT
SOCIETY IN ITS ENTIRETY WAS PERSONIFIED IN HIM JAVERT
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE WHEN M
MADELEINE UTTERED THAT WORD I AS WE
HAVE JUST HEARD POLICE INSPECTOR JAVERT WAS SEEN TO TURN TOWARD THE
MAYOR PALE COLD WITH BLUE LIPS AND A LOOK OF DESPAIR HIS WHOLE BODY
AGITATED BY AN IMPERCEPTIBLE QUIVER AND AN UNPRECEDENTED OCCURRENCE AND
SAY TO HIM WITH DOWNCAST EYES BUT A FIRM VOICE
MR
MAYOR THAT CANNOT BE
WHY NOT SAID M
MADELEINE
THIS MISERABLE WOMAN HAS INSULTED A CITIZEN
INSPECTOR JAVERT REPLIED THE MAYOR IN A CALM AND CONCILIATING TONE
LISTEN
YOU ARE AN HONEST MAN AND I FEEL NO HESITATION IN EXPLAINING
MATTERS TO YOU
HERE IS THE TRUE STATE OF THE CASE I WAS PASSING
THROUGH THE SQUARE JUST AS YOU WERE LEADING THIS WOMAN AWAY THERE WERE
STILL GROUPS OF PEOPLE STANDING ABOUT AND I MADE INQUIRIES AND LEARNED
EVERYTHING IT WAS THE TOWNSMAN WHO WAS IN THE WRONG AND WHO SHOULD HAVE
BEEN ARRESTED BY PROPERLY CONDUCTED POLICE
JAVERT RETORTED
THIS WRETCH HAS JUST INSULTED MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
THAT CONCERNS ME SAID M
MADELEINE
MY OWN INSULT BELONGS TO ME I
THINK
I CAN DO WHAT I PLEASE ABOUT IT
I BEG MONSIEUR LE MAIRE'S PARDON
THE INSULT IS NOT TO HIM BUT TO THE
LAW
INSPECTOR JAVERT REPLIED M
MADELEINE THE HIGHEST LAW IS
CONSCIENCE
I HAVE HEARD THIS WOMAN I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING
AND I MR
MAYOR DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SEE
THEN CONTENT YOURSELF WITH OBEYING
I AM OBEYING MY DUTY
MY DUTY DEMANDS THAT THIS WOMAN SHALL SERVE SIX
MONTHS IN PRISON
M
MADELEINE REPLIED GENTLY
HEED THIS WELL SHE WILL NOT SERVE A SINGLE DAY
AT THIS DECISIVE WORD JAVERT VENTURED TO FIX A SEARCHING LOOK ON THE
MAYOR AND TO SAY BUT IN A TONE OF VOICE THAT WAS STILL PROFOUNDLY
RESPECTFUL
I AM SORRY TO OPPOSE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE IT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY
LIFE BUT HE WILL PERMIT ME TO REMARK THAT I AM WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF MY
AUTHORITY
I CONFINE MYSELF SINCE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE DESIRES IT TO THE
QUESTION OF THE GENTLEMAN
I WAS PRESENT
THIS WOMAN FLUNG HERSELF
ON MONSIEUR BAMATABNOIS WHO IS AN ELECTOR AND THE PROPRIETOR OF THAT
HANDSOME HOUSE WITH A BALCONY WHICH FORMS THE CORNER OF THE ESPLANADE
THREE STORIES HIGH AND ENTIRELY OF CUT STONE
SUCH THINGS AS THERE ARE
IN THE WORLD IN ANY CASE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE THIS IS A QUESTION OF
POLICE REGULATIONS IN THE STREETS AND CONCERNS ME AND I SHALL DETAIN
THIS WOMAN FANTINE
THEN M
MADELEINE FOLDED HIS ARMS AND SAID IN A SEVERE VOICE WHICH NO
ONE IN THE TOWN HAD HEARD HITHERTO
THE MATTER TO WHICH YOU REFER IS ONE CONNECTED WITH THE MUNICIPAL
POLICE
ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF ARTICLES NINE ELEVEN FIFTEEN AND
SIXTY SIX OF THE CODE OF CRIMINAL EXAMINATION I AM THE JUDGE
I ORDER
THAT THIS WOMAN SHALL BE SET AT LIBERTY
JAVERT VENTURED TO MAKE A FINAL EFFORT
BUT MR
MAYOR
I REFER YOU TO ARTICLE EIGHTY ONE OF THE LAW OF THE 13TH OF DECEMBER
1799 IN REGARD TO ARBITRARY DETENTION
MONSIEUR LE MAIRE PERMIT ME
NOT ANOTHER WORD
BUT
LEAVE THE ROOM SAID M
MADELEINE
JAVERT RECEIVED THE BLOW ERECT FULL IN THE FACE IN HIS BREAST LIKE
A RUSSIAN SOLDIER
HE BOWED TO THE VERY EARTH BEFORE THE MAYOR AND LEFT
THE ROOM
FANTINE STOOD ASIDE FROM THE DOOR AND STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT AS HE
PASSED
NEVERTHELESS SHE ALSO WAS THE PREY TO A STRANGE CONFUSION
SHE HAD JUST
SEEN HERSELF A SUBJECT OF DISPUTE BETWEEN TWO OPPOSING POWERS
SHE HAD
SEEN TWO MEN WHO HELD IN THEIR HANDS HER LIBERTY HER LIFE HER SOUL
HER CHILD IN COMBAT BEFORE HER VERY EYES ONE OF THESE MEN WAS DRAWING
HER TOWARDS DARKNESS THE OTHER WAS LEADING HER BACK TOWARDS THE LIGHT
IN THIS CONFLICT VIEWED THROUGH THE EXAGGERATIONS OF TERROR THESE TWO
MEN HAD APPEARED TO HER LIKE TWO GIANTS THE ONE SPOKE LIKE HER DEMON
THE OTHER LIKE HER GOOD ANGEL
THE ANGEL HAD CONQUERED THE DEMON AND
STRANGE TO SAY THAT WHICH MADE HER SHUDDER FROM HEAD TO FOOT WAS
THE FACT THAT THIS ANGEL THIS LIBERATOR WAS THE VERY MAN WHOM SHE
ABHORRED THAT MAYOR WHOM SHE HAD SO LONG REGARDED AS THE AUTHOR OF ALL
HER WOES THAT MADELEINE AND AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN SHE HAD INSULTED
HIM IN SO HIDEOUS A FASHION HE HAD SAVED HER HAD SHE THEN BEEN
MISTAKEN MUST SHE CHANGE HER WHOLE SOUL SHE DID NOT KNOW SHE
TREMBLED
SHE LISTENED IN BEWILDERMENT SHE LOOKED ON IN AFFRIGHT AND
AT EVERY WORD UTTERED BY M
MADELEINE SHE FELT THE FRIGHTFUL SHADES OF
HATRED CRUMBLE AND MELT WITHIN HER AND SOMETHING WARM AND INEFFABLE
INDESCRIBABLE WHICH WAS BOTH JOY CONFIDENCE AND LOVE DAWN IN HER
HEART
WHEN JAVERT HAD TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE M
MADELEINE TURNED TO HER AND SAID
TO HER IN A DELIBERATE VOICE LIKE A SERIOUS MAN WHO DOES NOT WISH TO
WEEP AND WHO FINDS SOME DIFFICULTY IN SPEAKING
I HAVE HEARD YOU
I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED
I
BELIEVE THAT IT IS TRUE AND I FEEL THAT IT IS TRUE
I WAS EVEN IGNORANT
OF THE FACT THAT YOU HAD LEFT MY SHOP
WHY DID YOU NOT APPLY TO ME BUT
HERE I WILL PAY YOUR DEBTS I WILL SEND FOR YOUR CHILD OR YOU SHALL GO
TO HER
YOU SHALL LIVE HERE IN PARIS OR WHERE YOU PLEASE
I UNDERTAKE
THE CARE OF YOUR CHILD AND YOURSELF
YOU SHALL NOT WORK ANY LONGER IF
YOU DO NOT LIKE
I WILL GIVE ALL THE MONEY YOU REQUIRE
YOU SHALL BE
HONEST AND HAPPY ONCE MORE
AND LISTEN I DECLARE TO YOU THAT IF ALL
IS AS YOU SAY AND I DO NOT DOUBT IT YOU HAVE NEVER CEASED TO BE
VIRTUOUS AND HOLY IN THE SIGHT OF GOD
OH POOR WOMAN
THIS WAS MORE THAN FANTINE COULD BEAR
TO HAVE COSETTE TO LEAVE THIS
LIFE OF INFAMY
TO LIVE FREE RICH HAPPY RESPECTABLE WITH COSETTE TO
SEE ALL THESE REALITIES OF PARADISE BLOSSOM OF A SUDDEN IN THE MIDST OF
HER MISERY
SHE STARED STUPIDLY AT THIS MAN WHO WAS TALKING TO HER AND
COULD ONLY GIVE VENT TO TWO OR THREE SOBS OH OH OH
HER LIMBS GAVE WAY BENEATH HER SHE KNELT IN FRONT OF M
MADELEINE AND
BEFORE HE COULD PREVENT HER HE FELT HER GRASP HIS HAND AND PRESS HER
LIPS TO IT
THEN SHE FAINTED
BOOK SIXTH JAVERT
CHAPTER I THE BEGINNING OF REPOSE
M
MADELEINE HAD FANTINE REMOVED TO THAT INFIRMARY WHICH HE HAD
ESTABLISHED IN HIS OWN HOUSE
HE CONFIDED HER TO THE SISTERS WHO PUT
HER TO BED
A BURNING FEVER HAD COME ON
SHE PASSED A PART OF THE NIGHT
IN DELIRIUM AND RAVING
AT LENGTH HOWEVER SHE FELL ASLEEP
ON THE MORROW TOWARDS MIDDAY FANTINE AWOKE
SHE HEARD SOME ONE
BREATHING CLOSE TO HER BED SHE DREW ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND SAW M
MADELEINE STANDING THERE AND LOOKING AT SOMETHING OVER HER HEAD
HIS
GAZE WAS FULL OF PITY ANGUISH AND SUPPLICATION
SHE FOLLOWED ITS
DIRECTION AND SAW THAT IT WAS FIXED ON A CRUCIFIX WHICH WAS NAILED TO
THE WALL
THENCEFORTH M
MADELEINE WAS TRANSFIGURED IN FANTINE'S EYES
HE SEEMED
TO HER TO BE CLOTHED IN LIGHT
HE WAS ABSORBED IN A SORT OF PRAYER
SHE
GAZED AT HIM FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT DARING TO INTERRUPT HIM
AT LAST
SHE SAID TIMIDLY
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
M
MADELEINE HAD BEEN THERE FOR AN HOUR
HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR FANTINE
TO AWAKE
HE TOOK HER HAND FELT OF HER PULSE AND REPLIED
HOW DO YOU FEEL
WELL I HAVE SLEPT SHE REPLIED I THINK THAT I AM BETTER IT IS
NOTHING
HE ANSWERED RESPONDING TO THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH SHE HAD PUT TO HIM
AS THOUGH HE HAD JUST HEARD IT
I WAS PRAYING TO THE MARTYR THERE ON HIGH
AND HE ADDED IN HIS OWN MIND FOR THE MARTYR HERE BELOW
M
MADELEINE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT AND THE MORNING IN MAKING INQUIRIES
HE KNEW ALL NOW
HE KNEW FANTINE'S HISTORY IN ALL ITS HEART RENDING
DETAILS
HE WENT ON
YOU HAVE SUFFERED MUCH POOR MOTHER
OH DO NOT COMPLAIN YOU NOW HAVE
THE DOWRY OF THE ELECT
IT IS THUS THAT MEN ARE TRANSFORMED INTO ANGELS
IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO GO TO WORK OTHERWISE
YOU SEE THIS HELL FROM WHICH YOU HAVE JUST EMERGED IS THE FIRST FORM OF
HEAVEN
IT WAS NECESSARY TO BEGIN THERE
HE SIGHED DEEPLY
BUT SHE SMILED ON HIM WITH THAT SUBLIME SMILE IN WHICH
TWO TEETH WERE LACKING
THAT SAME NIGHT JAVERT WROTE A LETTER
THE NEXT MORNING BE POSTED IT
HIMSELF AT THE OFFICE OF M
SUR M
IT WAS ADDRESSED TO PARIS AND THE
SUPERSCRIPTION RAN TO MONSIEUR CHABOUILLET SECRETARY OF MONSIEUR LE
PREFET OF POLICE
AS THE AFFAIR IN THE STATION HOUSE HAD BEEN BRUITED
ABOUT THE POST MISTRESS AND SOME OTHER PERSONS WHO SAW THE LETTER
BEFORE IT WAS SENT OFF AND WHO RECOGNIZED JAVERT'S HANDWRITING ON THE
COVER THOUGHT THAT HE WAS SENDING IN HIS RESIGNATION
M
MADELEINE MADE HASTE TO WRITE TO THE THENARDIERS
FANTINE OWED
THEM ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FRANCS
HE SENT THEM THREE HUNDRED FRANCS
TELLING THEM TO PAY THEMSELVES FROM THAT SUM AND TO FETCH THE CHILD
INSTANTLY TO M
SUR M WHERE HER SICK MOTHER REQUIRED HER PRESENCE
THIS DAZZLED THENARDIER
THE DEVIL SAID THE MAN TO HIS WIFE DON'T
LET'S ALLOW THE CHILD TO GO
THIS LARK IS GOING TO TURN INTO A MILCH
COW
I SEE THROUGH IT
SOME NINNY HAS TAKEN A FANCY TO THE MOTHER
HE REPLIED WITH A VERY WELL DRAWN UP BILL FOR FIVE HUNDRED AND SOME ODD
FRANCS
IN THIS MEMORANDUM TWO INDISPUTABLE ITEMS FIGURED UP OVER THREE
HUNDRED FRANCS ONE FOR THE DOCTOR THE OTHER FOR THE APOTHECARY
WHO HAD ATTENDED AND PHYSICKED EPONINE AND AZELMA THROUGH TWO LONG
ILLNESSES
COSETTE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID HAD NOT BEEN ILL
IT WAS
ONLY A QUESTION OF A TRIFLING SUBSTITUTION OF NAMES
AT THE FOOT OF THE
MEMORANDUM THENARDIER WROTE RECEIVED ON ACCOUNT THREE HUNDRED FRANCS
M
MADELEINE IMMEDIATELY SENT THREE HUNDRED FRANCS MORE AND WROTE
MAKE HASTE TO BRING COSETTE
CHRISTI SAID THENARDIER LET'S NOT GIVE UP THE CHILD
IN THE MEANTIME FANTINE DID NOT RECOVER
SHE STILL REMAINED IN THE
INFIRMARY
THE SISTERS HAD AT FIRST ONLY RECEIVED AND NURSED THAT WOMAN WITH
REPUGNANCE
THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE BAS RELIEFS OF RHEIMS WILL RECALL
THE INFLATION OF THE LOWER LIP OF THE WISE VIRGINS AS THEY SURVEY THE
FOOLISH VIRGINS
THE ANCIENT SCORN OF THE VESTALS FOR THE AMBUBAJAE IS
ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND INSTINCTS OF FEMININE DIGNITY THE SISTERS
FELT IT WITH THE DOUBLE FORCE CONTRIBUTED BY RELIGION
BUT IN A FEW DAYS
FANTINE DISARMED THEM
SHE SAID ALL KINDS OF HUMBLE AND GENTLE THINGS
AND THE MOTHER IN HER PROVOKED TENDERNESS
ONE DAY THE SISTERS HEARD
HER SAY AMID HER FEVER I HAVE BEEN A SINNER BUT WHEN I HAVE MY CHILD
BESIDE ME IT WILL BE A SIGN THAT GOD HAS PARDONED ME
WHILE I WAS
LEADING A BAD LIFE I SHOULD NOT HAVE LIKED TO HAVE MY COSETTE WITH ME
I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE HER SAD ASTONISHED EYES
IT WAS FOR HER SAKE
THAT I DID EVIL AND THAT IS WHY GOD PARDONS ME
I SHALL FEEL THE
BENEDICTION OF THE GOOD GOD WHEN COSETTE IS HERE
I SHALL GAZE AT HER
IT WILL DO ME GOOD TO SEE THAT INNOCENT CREATURE
SHE KNOWS NOTHING AT
ALL
SHE IS AN ANGEL YOU SEE MY SISTERS
AT THAT AGE THE WINGS HAVE
NOT FALLEN OFF
M
MADELEINE WENT TO SEE HER TWICE A DAY AND EACH TIME SHE ASKED HIM
SHALL I SEE MY COSETTE SOON
HE ANSWERED
TO MORROW PERHAPS
SHE MAY ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT
I AM EXPECTING HER
AND THE MOTHER'S PALE FACE GREW RADIANT
OH SHE SAID HOW HAPPY I AM GOING TO BE
WE HAVE JUST SAID THAT SHE DID NOT RECOVER HER HEALTH
ON THE CONTRARY
HER CONDITION SEEMED TO BECOME MORE GRAVE FROM WEEK TO WEEK
THAT
HANDFUL OF SNOW APPLIED TO HER BARE SKIN BETWEEN HER SHOULDER BLADES HAD
BROUGHT ABOUT A SUDDEN SUPPRESSION OF PERSPIRATION AS A CONSEQUENCE OF
WHICH THE MALADY WHICH HAD BEEN SMOULDERING WITHIN HER FOR MANY YEARS
WAS VIOLENTLY DEVELOPED AT LAST
AT THAT TIME PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO
FOLLOW THE FINE LAENNEC'S FINE SUGGESTIONS IN THE STUDY AND TREATMENT OF
CHEST MALADIES
THE DOCTOR SOUNDED FANTINE'S CHEST AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
M
MADELEINE SAID TO THE DOCTOR
WELL
HAS SHE NOT A CHILD WHICH SHE DESIRES TO SEE SAID THE DOCTOR
YES
WELL MAKE HASTE AND GET IT HERE
M
MADELEINE SHUDDERED
FANTINE INQUIRED
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY
M
MADELEINE FORCED HIMSELF TO SMILE
HE SAID THAT YOUR CHILD WAS TO BE BROUGHT SPEEDILY
THAT THAT WOULD
RESTORE YOUR HEALTH
OH SHE REJOINED HE IS RIGHT BUT WHAT DO THOSE THENARDIERS MEAN
BY KEEPING MY COSETTE FROM ME OH SHE IS COMING
AT LAST I BEHOLD
HAPPINESS CLOSE BESIDE ME
IN THE MEANTIME THENARDIER DID NOT LET GO OF THE CHILD AND GAVE A
HUNDRED INSUFFICIENT REASONS FOR IT
COSETTE WAS NOT QUITE WELL ENOUGH
TO TAKE A JOURNEY IN THE WINTER
AND THEN THERE STILL REMAINED SOME
PETTY BUT PRESSING DEBTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY WERE COLLECTING
THE BILLS FOR THEM ETC ETC
I SHALL SEND SOME ONE TO FETCH COSETTE SAID FATHER MADELEINE
IF
NECESSARY I WILL GO MYSELF
HE WROTE THE FOLLOWING LETTER TO FANTINE'S DICTATION AND MADE HER SIGN
IT
MONSIEUR THENARDIER
YOU WILL DELIVER COSETTE TO THIS PERSON
YOU WILL BE PAID FOR ALL THE LITTLE THINGS
I HAVE THE HONOR TO SALUTE YOU WITH RESPECT
FANTINE
IN THE MEANTIME A SERIOUS INCIDENT OCCURRED
CARVE AS WE WILL THE
MYSTERIOUS BLOCK OF WHICH OUR LIFE IS MADE THE BLACK VEIN OF DESTINY
CONSTANTLY REAPPEARS IN IT
CHAPTER II HOW JEAN MAY BECOME CHAMP
ONE MORNING M
MADELEINE WAS IN HIS STUDY OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING IN
ADVANCE SOME PRESSING MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE IN CASE
HE SHOULD DECIDE TO TAKE THE TRIP TO MONTFERMEIL WHEN HE WAS INFORMED
THAT POLICE INSPECTOR JAVERT WAS DESIROUS OF SPEAKING WITH HIM
MADELEINE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM A DISAGREEABLE IMPRESSION ON HEARING
THIS NAME
JAVERT HAD AVOIDED HIM MORE THAN EVER SINCE THE AFFAIR OF THE
POLICE STATION AND M
MADELEINE HAD NOT SEEN HIM
ADMIT HIM HE SAID
JAVERT ENTERED
M
MADELEINE HAD RETAINED HIS SEAT NEAR THE FIRE PEN IN HAND HIS EYES
FIXED ON THE DOCKET WHICH HE WAS TURNING OVER AND ANNOTATING AND WHICH
CONTAINED THE TRIALS OF THE COMMISSION ON HIGHWAYS FOR THE INFRACTION OF
POLICE REGULATIONS
HE DID NOT DISTURB HIMSELF ON JAVERT'S ACCOUNT
HE
COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF POOR FANTINE AND IT SUITED HIM TO BE GLACIAL
IN HIS MANNER
JAVERT BESTOWED A RESPECTFUL SALUTE ON THE MAYOR WHOSE BACK WAS TURNED
TO HIM
THE MAYOR DID NOT LOOK AT HIM BUT WENT ON ANNOTATING THIS
DOCKET
JAVERT ADVANCED TWO OR THREE PACES INTO THE STUDY AND HALTED WITHOUT
BREAKING THE SILENCE
IF ANY PHYSIOGNOMIST WHO HAD BEEN FAMILIAR WITH JAVERT AND WHO HAD
MADE A LENGTHY STUDY OF THIS SAVAGE IN THE SERVICE OF CIVILIZATION
THIS SINGULAR COMPOSITE OF THE ROMAN THE SPARTAN THE MONK AND THE
CORPORAL THIS SPY WHO WAS INCAPABLE OF A LIE THIS UNSPOTTED POLICE
AGENT IF ANY PHYSIOGNOMIST HAD KNOWN HIS SECRET AND LONG CHERISHED
AVERSION FOR M
MADELEINE HIS CONFLICT WITH THE MAYOR ON THE SUBJECT OF
FANTINE AND HAD EXAMINED JAVERT AT THAT MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO
HIMSELF WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IT WAS EVIDENT TO ANY ONE ACQUAINTED
WITH THAT CLEAR UPRIGHT SINCERE HONEST AUSTERE AND FEROCIOUS
CONSCIENCE THAT JAVERT HAD BUT JUST GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT INTERIOR
STRUGGLE
JAVERT HAD NOTHING IN HIS SOUL WHICH HE HAD NOT ALSO IN HIS
COUNTENANCE
LIKE VIOLENT PEOPLE IN GENERAL HE WAS SUBJECT TO ABRUPT
CHANGES OF OPINION
HIS PHYSIOGNOMY HAD NEVER BEEN MORE PECULIAR AND
STARTLING
ON ENTERING HE BOWED TO M
MADELEINE WITH A LOOK IN WHICH
THERE WAS NEITHER RANCOR ANGER NOR DISTRUST HE HALTED A FEW PACES IN
THE REAR OF THE MAYOR'S ARM CHAIR AND THERE HE STOOD PERFECTLY ERECT
IN AN ATTITUDE ALMOST OF DISCIPLINE WITH THE COLD INGENUOUS ROUGHNESS
OF A MAN WHO HAS NEVER BEEN GENTLE AND WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN PATIENT HE
WAITED WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD WITHOUT MAKING A MOVEMENT IN GENUINE
HUMILITY AND TRANQUIL RESIGNATION CALM SERIOUS HAT IN HAND WITH
EYES CAST DOWN AND AN EXPRESSION WHICH WAS HALF WAY BETWEEN THAT OF A
SOLDIER IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS OFFICER AND A CRIMINAL IN THE PRESENCE
OF HIS JUDGE UNTIL IT SHOULD PLEASE THE MAYOR TO TURN ROUND
ALL THE
SENTIMENTS AS WELL AS ALL THE MEMORIES WHICH ONE MIGHT HAVE ATTRIBUTED
TO HIM HAD DISAPPEARED
THAT FACE AS IMPENETRABLE AND SIMPLE AS
GRANITE NO LONGER BORE ANY TRACE OF ANYTHING BUT A MELANCHOLY
DEPRESSION
HIS WHOLE PERSON BREATHED LOWLINESS AND FIRMNESS AND AN
INDESCRIBABLE COURAGEOUS DESPONDENCY
AT LAST THE MAYOR LAID DOWN HIS PEN AND TURNED HALF ROUND
WELL WHAT IS IT WHAT IS THE MATTER JAVERT
JAVERT REMAINED SILENT FOR AN INSTANT AS THOUGH COLLECTING HIS IDEAS
THEN RAISED HIS VOICE WITH A SORT OF SAD SOLEMNITY WHICH DID NOT
HOWEVER PRECLUDE SIMPLICITY
THIS IS THE MATTER MR
MAYOR A CULPABLE ACT HAS BEEN COMMITTED
WHAT ACT
AN INFERIOR AGENT OF THE AUTHORITIES HAS FAILED IN RESPECT AND IN THE
GRAVEST MANNER TOWARDS A MAGISTRATE
I HAVE COME TO BRING THE FACT TO
YOUR KNOWLEDGE AS IT IS MY DUTY TO DO
WHO IS THE AGENT ASKED M
MADELEINE
I SAID JAVERT
YOU
I
AND WHO IS THE MAGISTRATE WHO HAS REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE AGENT
YOU MR
MAYOR
M
MADELEINE SAT ERECT IN HIS ARM CHAIR
JAVERT WENT ON WITH A SEVERE
AIR AND HIS EYES STILL CAST DOWN
MR
MAYOR I HAVE COME TO REQUEST YOU TO INSTIGATE THE AUTHORITIES TO
DISMISS ME
M
MADELEINE OPENED HIS MOUTH IN AMAZEMENT
JAVERT INTERRUPTED HIM
YOU WILL SAY THAT I MIGHT HAVE HANDED IN MY RESIGNATION BUT THAT DOES
NOT SUFFICE
HANDING IN ONE'S RESIGNATION IS HONORABLE
I HAVE FAILED IN
MY DUTY I OUGHT TO BE PUNISHED I MUST BE TURNED OUT
AND AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED
MR
MAYOR YOU WERE SEVERE WITH ME THE OTHER DAY AND UNJUSTLY
BE SO
TO DAY WITH JUSTICE
COME NOW WHY EXCLAIMED M
MADELEINE
WHAT NONSENSE IS THIS
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS WHAT CULPABLE ACT HAVE YOU BEEN GUILTY OF
TOWARDS ME WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME WHAT ARE YOUR WRONGS WITH REGARD
TO ME YOU ACCUSE YOURSELF YOU WISH TO BE SUPERSEDED
TURNED OUT SAID JAVERT
TURNED OUT SO IT BE THEN
THAT IS WELL
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
YOU SHALL UNDERSTAND MR
MAYOR
JAVERT SIGHED FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS CHEST AND RESUMED STILL
COLDLY AND SADLY
MR
MAYOR SIX WEEKS AGO IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE SCENE OVER THAT WOMAN
I WAS FURIOUS AND I INFORMED AGAINST YOU
INFORMED AGAINST ME
AT THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE IN PARIS
M
MADELEINE WHO WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF LAUGHING MUCH OFTENER THAN
JAVERT HIMSELF BURST OUT LAUGHING NOW
AS A MAYOR WHO HAD ENCROACHED ON THE PROVINCE OF THE POLICE
AS AN EX CONVICT
THE MAYOR TURNED LIVID
JAVERT WHO HAD NOT RAISED HIS EYES WENT ON
I THOUGHT IT WAS SO
I HAD HAD AN IDEA FOR A LONG TIME A RESEMBLANCE
INQUIRIES WHICH YOU HAD CAUSED TO BE MADE AT FAVEROLLES THE STRENGTH
OF YOUR LOINS THE ADVENTURE WITH OLD FAUCHELEVANT YOUR SKILL IN
MARKSMANSHIP YOUR LEG WHICH YOU DRAG A LITTLE I HARDLY KNOW WHAT
ALL ABSURDITIES BUT AT ALL EVENTS I TOOK YOU FOR A CERTAIN JEAN
VALJEAN
A CERTAIN WHAT DID YOU SAY THE NAME WAS
JEAN VALJEAN
HE WAS A CONVICT WHOM I WAS IN THE HABIT OF SEEING TWENTY
YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS ADJUTANT GUARD OF CONVICTS AT TOULON
ON LEAVING
THE GALLEYS THIS JEAN VALJEAN AS IT APPEARS ROBBED A BISHOP THEN HE
COMMITTED ANOTHER THEFT ACCOMPANIED WITH VIOLENCE ON A PUBLIC HIGHWAY
ON THE PERSON OF A LITTLE SAVOYARD
HE DISAPPEARED EIGHT YEARS AGO NO
ONE KNOWS HOW AND HE HAS BEEN SOUGHT I FANCIED
IN SHORT I DID THIS
THING WRATH IMPELLED ME I DENOUNCED YOU AT THE PREFECTURE
M
MADELEINE WHO HAD TAKEN UP THE DOCKET AGAIN SEVERAL MOMENTS BEFORE
THIS RESUMED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE
AND WHAT REPLY DID YOU RECEIVE
THAT I WAS MAD
WELL
WELL THEY WERE RIGHT
IT IS LUCKY THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THE FACT
I AM FORCED TO DO SO SINCE THE REAL JEAN VALJEAN HAS BEEN FOUND
THE SHEET OF PAPER WHICH M
MADELEINE WAS HOLDING DROPPED FROM HIS
HAND HE RAISED HIS HEAD GAZED FIXEDLY AT JAVERT AND SAID WITH HIS
INDESCRIBABLE ACCENT
AH
JAVERT CONTINUED
THIS IS THE WAY IT IS MR
MAYOR
IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR AILLY LE HAUT CLOCHER AN OLD FELLOW WHO WAS CALLED
FATHER CHAMPMATHIEU
HE WAS A VERY WRETCHED CREATURE
NO ONE PAID ANY
ATTENTION TO HIM
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT SUCH PEOPLE SUBSIST ON
LATELY LAST
AUTUMN FATHER CHAMPMATHIEU WAS ARRESTED FOR THE THEFT OF SOME CIDER
APPLES FROM WELL NO MATTER A THEFT HAD BEEN COMMITTED A WALL SCALED
BRANCHES OF TREES BROKEN
MY CHAMPMATHIEU WAS ARRESTED
HE STILL HAD
THE BRANCH OF APPLE TREE IN HIS HAND
THE SCAMP IS LOCKED UP
UP TO
THIS POINT IT WAS MERELY AN AFFAIR OF A MISDEMEANOR
BUT HERE IS WHERE
PROVIDENCE INTERVENED
THE JAIL BEING IN A BAD CONDITION THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE FINDS IT
CONVENIENT TO TRANSFER CHAMPMATHIEU TO ARRAS WHERE THE DEPARTMENTAL
PRISON IS SITUATED
IN THIS PRISON AT ARRAS THERE IS AN EX CONVICT NAMED
BREVET WHO IS DETAINED FOR I KNOW NOT WHAT AND WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED
TURNKEY OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE OF GOOD BEHAVIOR
MR
MAYOR NO SOONER HAD
CHAMPMATHIEU ARRIVED THAN BREVET EXCLAIMS 'EH WHY I KNOW THAT MAN
HE IS A FAGOT 4 TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME MY GOOD MAN YOU ARE JEAN
VALJEAN 'JEAN VALJEAN WHO'S JEAN VALJEAN CHAMPMATHIEU FEIGNS
ASTONISHMENT
'DON'T PLAY THE INNOCENT DODGE SAYS BREVET
'YOU ARE
JEAN VALJEAN YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE GALLEYS OF TOULON IT WAS TWENTY
YEARS AGO WE WERE THERE TOGETHER CHAMPMATHIEU DENIES IT
PARBLEU YOU
UNDERSTAND
THE CASE IS INVESTIGATED
THE THING WAS WELL VENTILATED FOR
ME
THIS IS WHAT THEY DISCOVERED THIS CHAMPMATHIEU HAD BEEN THIRTY
YEARS AGO A PRUNER OF TREES IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES NOTABLY AT
FAVEROLLES
THERE ALL TRACE OF HIM WAS LOST
A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS HE
WAS SEEN AGAIN IN AUVERGNE THEN IN PARIS WHERE HE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN
A WHEELWRIGHT AND TO HAVE HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WAS A LAUNDRESS BUT THAT
HAS NOT BEEN PROVED
NOW BEFORE GOING TO THE GALLEYS FOR THEFT WHAT
WAS JEAN VALJEAN A PRUNER OF TREES
WHERE AT FAVEROLLES
ANOTHER FACT
THIS VALJEAN'S CHRISTIAN NAME WAS JEAN AND HIS MOTHER'S SURNAME WAS
MATHIEU
WHAT MORE NATURAL TO SUPPOSE THAN THAT ON EMERGING FROM THE
GALLEYS HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIS MOTHER'S NAME FOR THE PURPOSE OF
CONCEALING HIMSELF AND HAVE CALLED HIMSELF JEAN MATHIEU HE GOES TO
AUVERGNE
THE LOCAL PRONUNCIATION TURNS JEAN INTO CHAN HE IS CALLED
CHAN MATHIEU
OUR MAN OFFERS NO OPPOSITION AND BEHOLD HIM TRANSFORMED
INTO CHAMPMATHIEU
YOU FOLLOW ME DO YOU NOT INQUIRIES WERE MADE AT
FAVEROLLES
THE FAMILY OF JEAN VALJEAN IS NO LONGER THERE
IT IS NOT
KNOWN WHERE THEY HAVE GONE
YOU KNOW THAT AMONG THOSE CLASSES A FAMILY
OFTEN DISAPPEARS
SEARCH WAS MADE AND NOTHING WAS FOUND
WHEN SUCH
PEOPLE ARE NOT MUD THEY ARE DUST
AND THEN AS THE BEGINNING OF THE
STORY DATES THIRTY YEARS BACK THERE IS NO LONGER ANY ONE AT FAVEROLLES
WHO KNEW JEAN VALJEAN
INQUIRIES WERE MADE AT TOULON
BESIDES BREVET
THERE ARE ONLY TWO CONVICTS IN EXISTENCE WHO HAVE SEEN JEAN VALJEAN
THEY ARE COCHEPAILLE AND CHENILDIEU AND ARE SENTENCED FOR LIFE
THEY ARE TAKEN FROM THE GALLEYS AND CONFRONTED WITH THE PRETENDED
CHAMPMATHIEU
THEY DO NOT HESITATE HE IS JEAN VALJEAN FOR THEM AS WELL
AS FOR BREVET
THE SAME AGE HE IS FIFTY FOUR THE SAME HEIGHT THE
SAME AIR THE SAME MAN IN SHORT IT IS HE
IT WAS PRECISELY AT THIS
MOMENT THAT I FORWARDED MY DENUNCIATION TO THE PREFECTURE IN PARIS
I
WAS TOLD THAT I HAD LOST MY REASON AND THAT JEAN VALJEAN IS AT ARRAS
IN THE POWER OF THE AUTHORITIES
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHETHER THIS SURPRISED
ME WHEN I THOUGHT THAT I HAD THAT SAME JEAN VALJEAN HERE
I WRITE TO
THE EXAMINING JUDGE HE SENDS FOR ME CHAMPMATHIEU IS CONDUCTED TO ME
WELL INTERPOSED M
MADELEINE
JAVERT REPLIED HIS FACE INCORRUPTIBLE AND AS MELANCHOLY AS EVER
MR
MAYOR THE TRUTH IS THE TRUTH
I AM SORRY BUT THAT MAN IS JEAN
VALJEAN
I RECOGNIZED HIM ALSO
M
MADELEINE RESUMED IN A VERY LOW VOICE
YOU ARE SURE
JAVERT BEGAN TO LAUGH WITH THAT MOURNFUL LAUGH WHICH COMES FROM
PROFOUND CONVICTION
O SURE
HE STOOD THERE THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MOMENT MECHANICALLY TAKING PINCHES OF
POWDERED WOOD FOR BLOTTING INK FROM THE WOODEN BOWL WHICH STOOD ON THE
TABLE AND HE ADDED
AND EVEN NOW THAT I HAVE SEEN THE REAL JEAN VALJEAN I DO NOT SEE HOW I
COULD HAVE THOUGHT OTHERWISE
I BEG YOUR PARDON MR
MAYOR
JAVERT AS HE ADDRESSED THESE GRAVE AND SUPPLICATING WORDS TO THE MAN
WHO SIX WEEKS BEFORE HAD HUMILIATED HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WHOLE
STATION HOUSE AND BADE HIM LEAVE THE ROOM JAVERT THAT HAUGHTY MAN
WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY FULL OF SIMPLICITY AND DIGNITY M
MADELEINE MADE NO
OTHER REPLY TO HIS PRAYER THAN THE ABRUPT QUESTION
AND WHAT DOES THIS MAN SAY
AH INDEED MR
MAYOR IT'S A BAD BUSINESS
IF HE IS JEAN VALJEAN HE
HAS HIS PREVIOUS CONVICTION AGAINST HIM
TO CLIMB A WALL TO BREAK A
BRANCH TO PURLOIN APPLES IS A MISCHIEVOUS TRICK IN A CHILD FOR A
MAN IT IS A MISDEMEANOR FOR A CONVICT IT IS A CRIME
ROBBING
AND HOUSEBREAKING IT IS ALL THERE
IT IS NO LONGER A QUESTION OF
CORRECTIONAL POLICE IT IS A MATTER FOR THE COURT OF ASSIZES
IT IS NO
LONGER A MATTER OF A FEW DAYS IN PRISON IT IS THE GALLEYS FOR LIFE
AND
THEN THERE IS THE AFFAIR WITH THE LITTLE SAVOYARD WHO WILL RETURN I
HOPE
THE DEUCE THERE IS PLENTY TO DISPUTE IN THE MATTER IS THERE NOT
YES FOR ANY ONE BUT JEAN VALJEAN
BUT JEAN VALJEAN IS A SLY DOG
THAT
IS THE WAY I RECOGNIZED HIM
ANY OTHER MAN WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THINGS
WERE GETTING HOT FOR HIM HE WOULD STRUGGLE HE WOULD CRY OUT THE
KETTLE SINGS BEFORE THE FIRE HE WOULD NOT BE JEAN VALJEAN ET
CETERA
BUT HE HAS NOT THE APPEARANCE OF UNDERSTANDING HE SAYS 'I AM
CHAMPMATHIEU AND I WON'T DEPART FROM THAT HE HAS AN ASTONISHED AIR
HE PRETENDS TO BE STUPID IT IS FAR BETTER
OH THE ROGUE IS CLEVER BUT
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
THE PROOFS ARE THERE
HE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY
FOUR PERSONS THE OLD SCAMP WILL BE CONDEMNED
THE CASE HAS BEEN TAKEN
TO THE ASSIZES AT ARRAS
I SHALL GO THERE TO GIVE MY TESTIMONY
I HAVE
BEEN SUMMONED
M
MADELEINE HAD TURNED TO HIS DESK AGAIN AND TAKEN UP HIS DOCKET AND
WAS TURNING OVER THE LEAVES TRANQUILLY READING AND WRITING BY TURNS
LIKE A BUSY MAN
HE TURNED TO JAVERT
THAT WILL DO JAVERT
IN TRUTH ALL THESE DETAILS INTEREST ME BUT
LITTLE
WE ARE WASTING OUR TIME AND WE HAVE PRESSING BUSINESS ON HAND
JAVERT YOU WILL BETAKE YOURSELF AT ONCE TO THE HOUSE OF THE WOMAN
BUSEAUPIED WHO SELLS HERBS AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE SAINT SAULVE
YOU
WILL TELL HER THAT SHE MUST ENTER HER COMPLAINT AGAINST CARTER PIERRE
CHESNELONG
THE MAN IS A BRUTE WHO CAME NEAR CRUSHING THIS WOMAN AND
HER CHILD
HE MUST BE PUNISHED
YOU WILL THEN GO TO M
CHARCELLAY
RUE MONTRE DE CHAMPIGNY
HE COMPLAINED THAT THERE IS A GUTTER ON THE
ADJOINING HOUSE WHICH DISCHARGES RAIN WATER ON HIS PREMISES AND IS
UNDERMINING THE FOUNDATIONS OF HIS HOUSE
AFTER THAT YOU WILL VERIFY
THE INFRACTIONS OF POLICE REGULATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO ME IN
THE RUE GUIBOURG AT WIDOW DORIS'S AND RUE DU GARRAUD BLANC AT MADAME
RENEE LE BOSSE'S AND YOU WILL PREPARE DOCUMENTS
BUT I AM GIVING YOU A
GREAT DEAL OF WORK
ARE YOU NOT TO BE ABSENT DID YOU NOT TELL ME THAT
YOU WERE GOING TO ARRAS ON THAT MATTER IN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
SOONER THAN THAT MR
MAYOR
ON WHAT DAY THEN
WHY I THOUGHT THAT I HAD SAID TO MONSIEUR LE MAIRE THAT THE CASE WAS
TO BE TRIED TO MORROW AND THAT I AM TO SET OUT BY DILIGENCE TO NIGHT
M
MADELEINE MADE AN IMPERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT
AND HOW LONG WILL THE CASE LAST
ONE DAY AT THE MOST
THE JUDGMENT WILL BE PRONOUNCED TO MORROW EVENING
AT LATEST
BUT I SHALL NOT WAIT FOR THE SENTENCE WHICH IS CERTAIN I
SHALL RETURN HERE AS SOON AS MY DEPOSITION HAS BEEN TAKEN
THAT IS WELL SAID M
MADELEINE
AND HE DISMISSED JAVERT WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND
JAVERT DID NOT WITHDRAW
EXCUSE ME MR
MAYOR SAID HE
WHAT IS IT NOW DEMANDED M
MADELEINE
MR
MAYOR THERE IS STILL SOMETHING OF WHICH I MUST REMIND YOU
WHAT IS IT
THAT I MUST BE DISMISSED
M
MADELEINE ROSE
JAVERT YOU ARE A MAN OF HONOR AND I ESTEEM YOU
YOU EXAGGERATE YOUR
FAULT
MOREOVER THIS IS AN OFFENCE WHICH CONCERNS ME
JAVERT YOU
DESERVE PROMOTION INSTEAD OF DEGRADATION
I WISH YOU TO RETAIN YOUR
POST
JAVERT GAZED AT M
MADELEINE WITH HIS CANDID EYES IN WHOSE DEPTHS HIS
NOT VERY ENLIGHTENED BUT PURE AND RIGID CONSCIENCE SEEMED VISIBLE AND
SAID IN A TRANQUIL VOICE
MR
MAYOR I CANNOT GRANT YOU THAT
I REPEAT REPLIED M
MADELEINE THAT THE MATTER CONCERNS ME
BUT JAVERT HEEDING HIS OWN THOUGHT ONLY CONTINUED
SO FAR AS EXAGGERATION IS CONCERNED I AM NOT EXAGGERATING
THIS IS THE
WAY I REASON I HAVE SUSPECTED YOU UNJUSTLY
THAT IS NOTHING
IT IS OUR
RIGHT TO CHERISH SUSPICION ALTHOUGH SUSPICION DIRECTED ABOVE OURSELVES
IS AN ABUSE
BUT WITHOUT PROOFS IN A FIT OF RAGE WITH THE OBJECT
OF WREAKING MY VENGEANCE I HAVE DENOUNCED YOU AS A CONVICT YOU A
RESPECTABLE MAN A MAYOR A MAGISTRATE THAT IS SERIOUS VERY SERIOUS
I
HAVE INSULTED AUTHORITY IN YOUR PERSON I AN AGENT OF THE AUTHORITIES
IF ONE OF MY SUBORDINATES HAD DONE WHAT I HAVE DONE I SHOULD HAVE
DECLARED HIM UNWORTHY OF THE SERVICE AND HAVE EXPELLED HIM
WELL STOP
MR
MAYOR ONE WORD MORE
I HAVE OFTEN BEEN SEVERE IN THE COURSE OF MY
LIFE TOWARDS OTHERS
THAT IS JUST
I HAVE DONE WELL
NOW IF I WERE NOT
SEVERE TOWARDS MYSELF ALL THE JUSTICE THAT I HAVE DONE WOULD BECOME
INJUSTICE
OUGHT I TO SPARE MYSELF MORE THAN OTHERS NO WHAT I SHOULD
BE GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT TO CHASTISE OTHERS AND NOT MYSELF WHY I
SHOULD BE A BLACKGUARD THOSE WHO SAY 'THAT BLACKGUARD OF A JAVERT
WOULD BE IN THE RIGHT
MR
MAYOR I DO NOT DESIRE THAT YOU SHOULD TREAT
ME KINDLY YOUR KINDNESS ROUSED SUFFICIENT BAD BLOOD IN ME WHEN IT WAS
DIRECTED TO OTHERS
I WANT NONE OF IT FOR MYSELF
THE KINDNESS WHICH
CONSISTS IN UPHOLDING A WOMAN OF THE TOWN AGAINST A CITIZEN THE POLICE
AGENT AGAINST THE MAYOR THE MAN WHO IS DOWN AGAINST THE MAN WHO IS
UP IN THE WORLD IS WHAT I CALL FALSE KINDNESS
THAT IS THE SORT OF
KINDNESS WHICH DISORGANIZES SOCIETY
GOOD GOD IT IS VERY EASY TO BE
KIND THE DIFFICULTY LIES IN BEING JUST
COME IF YOU HAD BEEN WHAT I
THOUGHT YOU I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN KIND TO YOU NOT I YOU WOULD HAVE
SEEN MR
MAYOR I MUST TREAT MYSELF AS I WOULD TREAT ANY OTHER MAN
WHEN I HAVE SUBDUED MALEFACTORS WHEN I HAVE PROCEEDED WITH VIGOR
AGAINST RASCALS I HAVE OFTEN SAID TO MYSELF 'IF YOU FLINCH IF I EVER
CATCH YOU IN FAULT YOU MAY REST AT YOUR EASE I HAVE FLINCHED I
HAVE CAUGHT MYSELF IN A FAULT
SO MUCH THE WORSE COME DISCHARGED
CASHIERED EXPELLED THAT IS WELL
I HAVE ARMS
I WILL TILL THE SOIL IT
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME
MR
MAYOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE DEMANDS AN
EXAMPLE
I SIMPLY REQUIRE THE DISCHARGE OF INSPECTOR JAVERT
ALL THIS WAS UTTERED IN A PROUD HUMBLE DESPAIRING YET CONVINCED TONE
WHICH LENT INDESCRIBABLE GRANDEUR TO THIS SINGULAR HONEST MAN
WE SHALL SEE SAID M
MADELEINE
AND HE OFFERED HIM HIS HAND
JAVERT RECOILED AND SAID IN A WILD VOICE
EXCUSE ME MR
MAYOR BUT THIS MUST NOT BE
A MAYOR DOES NOT OFFER HIS
HAND TO A POLICE SPY
HE ADDED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
A POLICE SPY YES FROM THE MOMENT WHEN I HAVE MISUSED THE POLICE
I AM
NO MORE THAN A POLICE SPY
THEN HE BOWED PROFOUNDLY AND DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR
THERE HE WHEELED ROUND AND WITH EYES STILL DOWNCAST
MR
MAYOR HE SAID I SHALL CONTINUE TO SERVE UNTIL I AM SUPERSEDED
HE WITHDREW
M
MADELEINE REMAINED THOUGHTFULLY LISTENING TO THE FIRM
SURE STEP WHICH DIED AWAY ON THE PAVEMENT OF THE CORRIDOR
BOOK SEVENTH THE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIR
CHAPTER I SISTER SIMPLICE
THE INCIDENTS THE READER IS ABOUT TO PERUSE WERE NOT ALL KNOWN AT M
SUR
M
BUT THE SMALL PORTION OF THEM WHICH BECAME KNOWN LEFT SUCH A MEMORY
IN THAT TOWN THAT A SERIOUS GAP WOULD EXIST IN THIS BOOK IF WE DID
NOT NARRATE THEM IN THEIR MOST MINUTE DETAILS
AMONG THESE DETAILS THE
READER WILL ENCOUNTER TWO OR THREE IMPROBABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WE
PRESERVE OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE TRUTH
ON THE AFTERNOON FOLLOWING THE VISIT OF JAVERT M
MADELEINE WENT TO SEE
FANTINE ACCORDING TO HIS WONT
BEFORE ENTERING FANTINE'S ROOM HE HAD SISTER SIMPLICE SUMMONED
THE TWO NUNS WHO PERFORMED THE SERVICES OF NURSE IN THE INFIRMARY
LAZARISTE LADIES LIKE ALL SISTERS OF CHARITY BORE THE NAMES OF SISTER
PERPETUE AND SISTER SIMPLICE
SISTER PERPETUE WAS AN ORDINARY VILLAGER A SISTER OF CHARITY IN A
COARSE STYLE WHO HAD ENTERED THE SERVICE OF GOD AS ONE ENTERS ANY OTHER
SERVICE
SHE WAS A NUN AS OTHER WOMEN ARE COOKS
THIS TYPE IS NOT
SO VERY RARE
THE MONASTIC ORDERS GLADLY ACCEPT THIS HEAVY PEASANT
EARTHENWARE WHICH IS EASILY FASHIONED INTO A CAPUCHIN OR AN URSULINE
THESE RUSTICS ARE UTILIZED FOR THE ROUGH WORK OF DEVOTION
THE
TRANSITION FROM A DROVER TO A CARMELITE IS NOT IN THE LEAST VIOLENT
THE ONE TURNS INTO THE OTHER WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT THE FUND OF IGNORANCE
COMMON TO THE VILLAGE AND THE CLOISTER IS A PREPARATION READY AT HAND
AND PLACES THE BOOR AT ONCE ON THE SAME FOOTING AS THE MONK A LITTLE
MORE AMPLITUDE IN THE SMOCK AND IT BECOMES A FROCK
SISTER PERPETUE
WAS A ROBUST NUN FROM MARINES NEAR PONTOISE WHO CHATTERED HER PATOIS
DRONED GRUMBLED SUGARED THE POTION ACCORDING TO THE BIGOTRY OR THE
HYPOCRISY OF THE INVALID TREATED HER PATIENTS ABRUPTLY ROUGHLY WAS
CRABBED WITH THE DYING ALMOST FLUNG GOD IN THEIR FACES STONED THEIR
DEATH AGONY WITH PRAYERS MUMBLED IN A RAGE WAS BOLD HONEST AND RUDDY
SISTER SIMPLICE WAS WHITE WITH A WAXEN PALLOR
BESIDE SISTER PERPETUE
SHE WAS THE TAPER BESIDE THE CANDLE
VINCENT DE PAUL HAS DIVINELY TRACED
THE FEATURES OF THE SISTER OF CHARITY IN THESE ADMIRABLE WORDS IN WHICH
HE MINGLES AS MUCH FREEDOM AS SERVITUDE THEY SHALL HAVE FOR THEIR
CONVENT ONLY THE HOUSE OF THE SICK FOR CELL ONLY A HIRED ROOM FOR
CHAPEL ONLY THEIR PARISH CHURCH FOR CLOISTER ONLY THE STREETS OF THE
TOWN AND THE WARDS OF THE HOSPITALS FOR ENCLOSURE ONLY OBEDIENCE FOR
GRATINGS ONLY THE FEAR OF GOD FOR VEIL ONLY MODESTY THIS IDEAL WAS
REALIZED IN THE LIVING PERSON OF SISTER SIMPLICE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN
YOUNG AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE WOULD NEVER GROW OLD
NO ONE COULD
HAVE TOLD SISTER SIMPLICE'S AGE
SHE WAS A PERSON WE DARE NOT SAY A
WOMAN WHO WAS GENTLE AUSTERE WELL BRED COLD AND WHO HAD NEVER LIED
SHE WAS SO GENTLE THAT SHE APPEARED FRAGILE BUT SHE WAS MORE SOLID THAN
GRANITE
SHE TOUCHED THE UNHAPPY WITH FINGERS THAT WERE CHARMINGLY PURE
AND FINE
THERE WAS SO TO SPEAK SILENCE IN HER SPEECH SHE SAID JUST
WHAT WAS NECESSARY AND SHE POSSESSED A TONE OF VOICE WHICH WOULD
HAVE EQUALLY EDIFIED A CONFESSIONAL OR ENCHANTED A DRAWING ROOM
THIS
DELICACY ACCOMMODATED ITSELF TO THE SERGE GOWN FINDING IN THIS HARSH
CONTACT A CONTINUAL REMINDER OF HEAVEN AND OF GOD
LET US EMPHASIZE
ONE DETAIL
NEVER TO HAVE LIED NEVER TO HAVE SAID FOR ANY INTEREST
WHATEVER EVEN IN INDIFFERENCE ANY SINGLE THING WHICH WAS NOT THE
TRUTH THE SACRED TRUTH WAS SISTER SIMPLICE'S DISTINCTIVE TRAIT IT WAS
THE ACCENT OF HER VIRTUE
SHE WAS ALMOST RENOWNED IN THE CONGREGATION
FOR THIS IMPERTURBABLE VERACITY
THE ABBE SICARD SPEAKS OF SISTER
SIMPLICE IN A LETTER TO THE DEAF MUTE MASSIEU
HOWEVER PURE AND SINCERE
WE MAY BE WE ALL BEAR UPON OUR CANDOR THE CRACK OF THE LITTLE INNOCENT
LIE
SHE DID NOT
LITTLE LIE INNOCENT LIE DOES SUCH A THING EXIST TO
LIE IS THE ABSOLUTE FORM OF EVIL
TO LIE A LITTLE IS NOT POSSIBLE HE
WHO LIES LIES THE WHOLE LIE
TO LIE IS THE VERY FACE OF THE DEMON
SATAN HAS TWO NAMES HE IS CALLED SATAN AND LYING
THAT IS WHAT SHE
THOUGHT AND AS SHE THOUGHT SO SHE DID
THE RESULT WAS THE WHITENESS
WHICH WE HAVE MENTIONED A WHITENESS WHICH COVERED EVEN HER LIPS AND HER
EYES WITH RADIANCE
HER SMILE WAS WHITE HER GLANCE WAS WHITE
THERE WAS
NOT A SINGLE SPIDER'S WEB NOT A GRAIN OF DUST ON THE GLASS WINDOW OF
THAT CONSCIENCE
ON ENTERING THE ORDER OF SAINT VINCENT DE PAUL SHE HAD
TAKEN THE NAME OF SIMPLICE BY SPECIAL CHOICE
SIMPLICE OF SICILY AS WE
KNOW IS THE SAINT WHO PREFERRED TO ALLOW BOTH HER BREASTS TO BE TORN
OFF RATHER THAN TO SAY THAT SHE HAD BEEN BORN AT SEGESTA WHEN SHE HAD
BEEN BORN AT SYRACUSE A LIE WHICH WOULD HAVE SAVED HER
THIS PATRON
SAINT SUITED THIS SOUL
SISTER SIMPLICE ON HER ENTRANCE INTO THE ORDER HAD HAD TWO FAULTS
WHICH SHE HAD GRADUALLY CORRECTED SHE HAD A TASTE FOR DAINTIES AND SHE
LIKED TO RECEIVE LETTERS
SHE NEVER READ ANYTHING BUT A BOOK OF PRAYERS
PRINTED IN LATIN IN COARSE TYPE
SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND LATIN BUT SHE
UNDERSTOOD THE BOOK
THIS PIOUS WOMAN HAD CONCEIVED AN AFFECTION FOR FANTINE PROBABLY
FEELING A LATENT VIRTUE THERE AND SHE HAD DEVOTED HERSELF ALMOST
EXCLUSIVELY TO HER CARE
M
MADELEINE TOOK SISTER SIMPLICE APART AND RECOMMENDED FANTINE TO HER
IN A SINGULAR TONE WHICH THE SISTER RECALLED LATER ON
ON LEAVING THE SISTER HE APPROACHED FANTINE
FANTINE AWAITED M
MADELEINE'S APPEARANCE EVERY DAY AS ONE AWAITS A RAY
OF WARMTH AND JOY
SHE SAID TO THE SISTERS I ONLY LIVE WHEN MONSIEUR
LE MAIRE IS HERE
SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF FEVER THAT DAY
AS SOON AS SHE SAW M
MADELEINE
SHE ASKED HIM
AND COSETTE
HE REPLIED WITH A SMILE
SOON
M
MADELEINE WAS THE SAME AS USUAL WITH FANTINE
ONLY HE REMAINED AN
HOUR INSTEAD OF HALF AN HOUR TO FANTINE'S GREAT DELIGHT
HE URGED EVERY
ONE REPEATEDLY NOT TO ALLOW THE INVALID TO WANT FOR ANYTHING
IT WAS
NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN HIS COUNTENANCE BECAME VERY SOMBRE
BUT THIS WAS EXPLAINED WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT THE DOCTOR HAD BENT
DOWN TO HIS EAR AND SAID TO HIM SHE IS LOSING GROUND FAST
THEN HE RETURNED TO THE TOWN HALL AND THE CLERK OBSERVED HIM
ATTENTIVELY EXAMINING A ROAD MAP OF FRANCE WHICH HUNG IN HIS STUDY
HE
WROTE A FEW FIGURES ON A BIT OF PAPER WITH A PENCIL
CHAPTER II THE PERSPICACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE
FROM THE TOWN HALL HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE TOWN TO A
FLEMING NAMED MASTER SCAUFFLAER FRENCH SCAUFFLAIRE WHO LET OUT HORSES
AND CABRIOLETS AS DESIRED
IN ORDER TO REACH THIS SCAUFFLAIRE THE SHORTEST WAY WAS TO TAKE THE
LITTLE FREQUENTED STREET IN WHICH WAS SITUATED THE PARSONAGE OF THE
PARISH IN WHICH M
MADELEINE RESIDED
THE CURE WAS IT WAS SAID A
WORTHY RESPECTABLE AND SENSIBLE MAN
AT THE MOMENT WHEN M
MADELEINE
ARRIVED IN FRONT OF THE PARSONAGE THERE WAS BUT ONE PASSER BY IN THE
STREET AND THIS PERSON NOTICED THIS AFTER THE MAYOR HAD PASSED THE
PRIEST'S HOUSE HE HALTED STOOD MOTIONLESS THEN TURNED ABOUT AND
RETRACED HIS STEPS TO THE DOOR OF THE PARSONAGE WHICH HAD AN IRON
KNOCKER
HE LAID HIS HAND QUICKLY ON THE KNOCKER AND LIFTED IT THEN
HE PAUSED AGAIN AND STOPPED SHORT AS THOUGH IN THOUGHT AND AFTER
THE LAPSE OF A FEW SECONDS INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE KNOCKER TO FALL
ABRUPTLY HE PLACED IT GENTLY AND RESUMED HIS WAY WITH A SORT OF HASTE
WHICH HAD NOT BEEN APPARENT PREVIOUSLY
M
MADELEINE FOUND MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE AT HOME ENGAGED IN STITCHING A
HARNESS OVER
MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE HE INQUIRED HAVE YOU A GOOD HORSE
MR
MAYOR SAID THE FLEMING ALL MY HORSES ARE GOOD
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY A GOOD HORSE
I MEAN A HORSE WHICH CAN TRAVEL TWENTY LEAGUES IN A DAY
THE DEUCE SAID THE FLEMING
TWENTY LEAGUES
YES
HITCHED TO A CABRIOLET
YES
AND HOW LONG CAN HE REST AT THE END OF HIS JOURNEY
HE MUST BE ABLE TO SET OUT AGAIN ON THE NEXT DAY IF NECESSARY
TO TRAVERSE THE SAME ROAD
YES
THE DEUCE THE DEUCE AND IT IS TWENTY LEAGUES
M
MADELEINE DREW FROM HIS POCKET THE PAPER ON WHICH HE HAD PENCILLED
SOME FIGURES
HE SHOWED IT TO THE FLEMING
THE FIGURES WERE 5 6 8 1 2
YOU SEE HE SAID TOTAL NINETEEN AND A HALF AS WELL SAY TWENTY
LEAGUES
MR
MAYOR RETURNED THE FLEMING I HAVE JUST WHAT YOU WANT
MY LITTLE
WHITE HORSE YOU MAY HAVE SEEN HIM PASS OCCASIONALLY HE IS A SMALL
BEAST FROM LOWER BOULONNAIS
HE IS FULL OF FIRE
THEY WANTED TO MAKE
A SADDLE HORSE OF HIM AT FIRST
BAH HE REARED HE KICKED HE LAID
EVERYBODY FLAT ON THE GROUND
HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE VICIOUS AND NO ONE
KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM
I BOUGHT HIM
I HARNESSED HIM TO A CARRIAGE
THAT IS WHAT HE WANTED SIR HE IS AS GENTLE AS A GIRL HE GOES LIKE THE
WIND
AH INDEED HE MUST NOT BE MOUNTED
IT DOES NOT SUIT HIS IDEAS TO
BE A SADDLE HORSE
EVERY ONE HAS HIS AMBITION
'DRAW YES
CARRY NO
WE MUST SUPPOSE THAT IS WHAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
AND HE WILL ACCOMPLISH THE TRIP
YOUR TWENTY LEAGUES ALL AT A FULL TROT AND IN LESS THAN EIGHT HOURS
BUT HERE ARE THE CONDITIONS
STATE THEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU WILL GIVE HIM HALF AN HOUR'S BREATHING SPELL
MIDWAY OF THE ROAD HE WILL EAT AND SOME ONE MUST BE BY WHILE HE IS
EATING TO PREVENT THE STABLE BOY OF THE INN FROM STEALING HIS OATS FOR
I HAVE NOTICED THAT IN INNS THE OATS ARE MORE OFTEN DRUNK BY THE STABLE
MEN THAN EATEN BY THE HORSES
SOME ONE WILL BE BY
IN THE SECOND PLACE IS THE CABRIOLET FOR MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
YES
DOES MONSIEUR LE MAIRE KNOW HOW TO DRIVE
YES
WELL MONSIEUR LE MAIRE WILL TRAVEL ALONE AND WITHOUT BAGGAGE IN ORDER
NOT TO OVERLOAD THE HORSE
AGREED
BUT AS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE WILL HAVE NO ONE WITH HIM HE WILL BE OBLIGED
TO TAKE THE TROUBLE HIMSELF OF SEEING THAT THE OATS ARE NOT STOLEN
THAT IS UNDERSTOOD
I AM TO HAVE THIRTY FRANCS A DAY
THE DAYS OF REST TO BE PAID FOR
ALSO NOT A FARTHING LESS AND THE BEAST'S FOOD TO BE AT MONSIEUR LE
MAIRE'S EXPENSE
M
MADELEINE DREW THREE NAPOLEONS FROM HIS PURSE AND LAID THEM ON THE
TABLE
HERE IS THE PAY FOR TWO DAYS IN ADVANCE
FOURTHLY FOR SUCH A JOURNEY A CABRIOLET WOULD BE TOO HEAVY AND WOULD
FATIGUE THE HORSE
MONSIEUR LE MAIRE MUST CONSENT TO TRAVEL IN A LITTLE
TILBURY THAT I OWN
I CONSENT TO THAT
IT IS LIGHT BUT IT HAS NO COVER
THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME
HAS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE REFLECTED THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER
M
MADELEINE DID NOT REPLY
THE FLEMING RESUMED
THAT IT IS VERY COLD
M
MADELEINE PRESERVED SILENCE
MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE CONTINUED
THAT IT MAY RAIN
M
MADELEINE RAISED HIS HEAD AND SAID
THE TILBURY AND THE HORSE WILL BE IN FRONT OF MY DOOR TO MORROW MORNING
AT HALF PAST FOUR O'CLOCK
OF COURSE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE REPLIED SCAUFFLAIRE THEN SCRATCHING A
SPECK IN THE WOOD OF THE TABLE WITH HIS THUMB NAIL HE RESUMED WITH THAT
CARELESS AIR WHICH THE FLEMINGS UNDERSTAND SO WELL HOW TO MINGLE WITH
THEIR SHREWDNESS
BUT THIS IS WHAT I AM THINKING OF NOW MONSIEUR LE MAIRE HAS NOT TOLD
ME WHERE HE IS GOING
WHERE IS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE GOING
HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF NOTHING ELSE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE
CONVERSATION BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHY HE HAD NOT DARED TO PUT THE
QUESTION
ARE YOUR HORSE'S FORELEGS GOOD SAID M
MADELEINE
YES MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
YOU MUST HOLD HIM IN A LITTLE WHEN GOING DOWN
HILL
ARE THERE MANY DESCENDS BETWEEN HERE AND THE PLACE WHITHER YOU ARE
GOING
DO NOT FORGET TO BE AT MY DOOR AT PRECISELY HALF PAST FOUR O'CLOCK
TO MORROW MORNING REPLIED M
MADELEINE AND HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE
THE FLEMING REMAINED UTTERLY STUPID AS HE HIMSELF SAID SOME TIME
AFTERWARDS
THE MAYOR HAD BEEN GONE TWO OR THREE MINUTES WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN
IT WAS THE MAYOR ONCE MORE
HE STILL WORE THE SAME IMPASSIVE AND PREOCCUPIED AIR
MONSIEUR SCAUFFLAIRE SAID HE AT WHAT SUM DO YOU ESTIMATE THE VALUE
OF THE HORSE AND TILBURY WHICH YOU ARE TO LET TO ME THE ONE BEARING
THE OTHER
THE ONE DRAGGING THE OTHER MONSIEUR LE MAIRE SAID THE FLEMING WITH
A BROAD SMILE
SO BE IT
WELL
DOES MONSIEUR LE MAIRE WISH TO PURCHASE THEM OR ME
NO BUT I WISH TO GUARANTEE YOU IN ANY CASE
YOU SHALL GIVE ME BACK
THE SUM AT MY RETURN
AT WHAT VALUE DO YOU ESTIMATE YOUR HORSE AND
CABRIOLET
FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
HERE IT IS
M
MADELEINE LAID A BANK BILL ON THE TABLE THEN LEFT THE ROOM AND THIS
TIME HE DID NOT RETURN
MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE EXPERIENCED A FRIGHTFUL REGRET THAT HE HAD NOT SAID A
THOUSAND FRANCS
BESIDES THE HORSE AND TILBURY TOGETHER WERE WORTH BUT A
HUNDRED CROWNS
THE FLEMING CALLED HIS WIFE AND RELATED THE AFFAIR TO HER
WHERE THE
DEVIL COULD MONSIEUR LE MAIRE BE GOING THEY HELD COUNSEL TOGETHER
HE IS GOING TO PARIS SAID THE WIFE
I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID THE
HUSBAND
M
MADELEINE HAD FORGOTTEN THE PAPER WITH THE FIGURES ON IT AND IT LAY
ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
THE FLEMING PICKED IT UP AND STUDIED IT
FIVE
SIX EIGHT AND A HALF THAT MUST DESIGNATE THE POSTING RELAYS HE
TURNED TO HIS WIFE
I HAVE FOUND OUT
WHAT
IT IS FIVE LEAGUES FROM HERE TO HESDIN SIX FROM HESDIN TO SAINT POL
EIGHT AND A HALF FROM SAINT POL TO ARRAS
HE IS GOING TO ARRAS
MEANWHILE M
MADELEINE HAD RETURNED HOME
HE HAD TAKEN THE LONGEST WAY
TO RETURN FROM MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE'S AS THOUGH THE PARSONAGE DOOR HAD
BEEN A TEMPTATION FOR HIM AND HE HAD WISHED TO AVOID IT
HE ASCENDED
TO HIS ROOM AND THERE HE SHUT HIMSELF UP WHICH WAS A VERY SIMPLE ACT
SINCE HE LIKED TO GO TO BED EARLY
NEVERTHELESS THE PORTRESS OF THE
FACTORY WHO WAS AT THE SAME TIME M
MADELEINE'S ONLY SERVANT NOTICED
THAT THE LATTER'S LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED AT HALF PAST EIGHT AND SHE
MENTIONED IT TO THE CASHIER WHEN HE CAME HOME ADDING
IS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE ILL I THOUGHT HE HAD A RATHER SINGULAR AIR
THIS CASHIER OCCUPIED A ROOM SITUATED DIRECTLY UNDER M
MADELEINE'S
CHAMBER
HE PAID NO HEED TO THE PORTRESS'S WORDS BUT WENT TO BED AND
TO SLEEP
TOWARDS MIDNIGHT HE WOKE UP WITH A START IN HIS SLEEP HE HAD
HEARD A NOISE ABOVE HIS HEAD
HE LISTENED IT WAS A FOOTSTEP PACING BACK
AND FORTH AS THOUGH SOME ONE WERE WALKING IN THE ROOM ABOVE HIM
HE
LISTENED MORE ATTENTIVELY AND RECOGNIZED M
MADELEINE'S STEP
THIS
STRUCK HIM AS STRANGE USUALLY THERE WAS NO NOISE IN M
MADELEINE'S
CHAMBER UNTIL HE ROSE IN THE MORNING
A MOMENT LATER THE CASHIER HEARD
A NOISE WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF A CUPBOARD BEING OPENED AND THEN SHUT
AGAIN THEN A PIECE OF FURNITURE WAS DISARRANGED THEN A PAUSE ENSUED
THEN THE STEP BEGAN AGAIN
THE CASHIER SAT UP IN BED QUITE AWAKE NOW
AND STARING AND THROUGH HIS WINDOW PANES HE SAW THE REDDISH GLEAM OF A
LIGHTED WINDOW REFLECTED ON THE OPPOSITE WALL FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE
RAYS IT COULD ONLY COME FROM THE WINDOW OF M
MADELEINE'S CHAMBER
THE
REFLECTION WAVERED AS THOUGH IT CAME RATHER FROM A FIRE WHICH HAD
BEEN LIGHTED THAN FROM A CANDLE
THE SHADOW OF THE WINDOW FRAME WAS NOT
SHOWN WHICH INDICATED THAT THE WINDOW WAS WIDE OPEN
THE FACT THAT THIS
WINDOW WAS OPEN IN SUCH COLD WEATHER WAS SURPRISING
THE CASHIER FELL
ASLEEP AGAIN
AN HOUR OR TWO LATER HE WAKED AGAIN
THE SAME STEP WAS
STILL PASSING SLOWLY AND REGULARLY BACK AND FORTH OVERHEAD
THE REFLECTION WAS STILL VISIBLE ON THE WALL BUT NOW IT WAS PALE AND
PEACEFUL LIKE THE REFLECTION OF A LAMP OR OF A CANDLE
THE WINDOW WAS
STILL OPEN
THIS IS WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN M
MADELEINE'S ROOM
CHAPTER III A TEMPEST IN A SKULL
THE READER HAS NO DOUBT ALREADY DIVINED THAT M
MADELEINE IS NO OTHER
THAN JEAN VALJEAN
WE HAVE ALREADY GAZED INTO THE DEPTHS OF THIS CONSCIENCE THE MOMENT HAS
NOW COME WHEN WE MUST TAKE ANOTHER LOOK INTO IT
WE DO SO NOT WITHOUT
EMOTION AND TREPIDATION
THERE IS NOTHING MORE TERRIBLE IN EXISTENCE
THAN THIS SORT OF CONTEMPLATION
THE EYE OF THE SPIRIT CAN NOWHERE FIND
MORE DAZZLING BRILLIANCE AND MORE SHADOW THAN IN MAN IT CAN FIX ITSELF
ON NO OTHER THING WHICH IS MORE FORMIDABLE MORE COMPLICATED MORE
MYSTERIOUS AND MORE INFINITE
THERE IS A SPECTACLE MORE GRAND THAN THE
SEA IT IS HEAVEN THERE IS A SPECTACLE MORE GRAND THAN HEAVEN IT IS
THE INMOST RECESSES OF THE SOUL
TO MAKE THE POEM OF THE HUMAN CONSCIENCE WERE IT ONLY WITH REFERENCE TO
A SINGLE MAN WERE IT ONLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BASEST OF MEN WOULD
BE TO BLEND ALL EPICS INTO ONE SUPERIOR AND DEFINITIVE EPIC
CONSCIENCE
IS THE CHAOS OF CHIMERAS OF LUSTS AND OF TEMPTATIONS THE FURNACE OF
DREAMS THE LAIR OF IDEAS OF WHICH WE ARE ASHAMED IT IS THE PANDEMONIUM
OF SOPHISMS IT IS THE BATTLEFIELD OF THE PASSIONS
PENETRATE AT
CERTAIN HOURS PAST THE LIVID FACE OF A HUMAN BEING WHO IS ENGAGED
IN REFLECTION AND LOOK BEHIND GAZE INTO THAT SOUL GAZE INTO THAT
OBSCURITY
THERE BENEATH THAT EXTERNAL SILENCE BATTLES OF GIANTS
LIKE THOSE RECORDED IN HOMER ARE IN PROGRESS SKIRMISHES OF DRAGONS AND
HYDRAS AND SWARMS OF PHANTOMS AS IN MILTON VISIONARY CIRCLES AS IN
DANTE
WHAT A SOLEMN THING IS THIS INFINITY WHICH EVERY MAN BEARS WITHIN
HIM AND WHICH HE MEASURES WITH DESPAIR AGAINST THE CAPRICES OF HIS
BRAIN AND THE ACTIONS OF HIS LIFE
ALIGHIERI ONE DAY MET WITH A SINISTER LOOKING DOOR BEFORE WHICH HE
HESITATED
HERE IS ONE BEFORE US UPON WHOSE THRESHOLD WE HESITATE
LET
US ENTER NEVERTHELESS
WE HAVE BUT LITTLE TO ADD TO WHAT THE READER ALREADY KNOWS OF WHAT HAD
HAPPENED TO JEAN VALJEAN AFTER THE ADVENTURE WITH LITTLE GERVAIS
FROM
THAT MOMENT FORTH HE WAS AS WE HAVE SEEN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT MAN
WHAT
THE BISHOP HAD WISHED TO MAKE OF HIM THAT HE CARRIED OUT
IT WAS MORE
THAN A TRANSFORMATION IT WAS A TRANSFIGURATION
HE SUCCEEDED IN DISAPPEARING SOLD THE BISHOP'S SILVER RESERVING ONLY
THE CANDLESTICKS AS A SOUVENIR CREPT FROM TOWN TO TOWN TRAVERSED
FRANCE CAME TO M
SUR M CONCEIVED THE IDEA WHICH WE HAVE MENTIONED
ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE HAVE RELATED SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING HIMSELF SAFE
FROM SEIZURE AND INACCESSIBLE AND THENCEFORTH ESTABLISHED AT M
SUR
M HAPPY IN FEELING HIS CONSCIENCE SADDENED BY THE PAST AND THE FIRST
HALF OF HIS EXISTENCE BELIED BY THE LAST HE LIVED IN PEACE REASSURED
AND HOPEFUL HAVING HENCEFORTH ONLY TWO THOUGHTS TO CONCEAL HIS NAME
AND TO SANCTIFY HIS LIFE TO ESCAPE MEN AND TO RETURN TO GOD
THESE TWO THOUGHTS WERE SO CLOSELY INTERTWINED IN HIS MIND THAT
THEY FORMED BUT A SINGLE ONE THERE BOTH WERE EQUALLY ABSORBING AND
IMPERATIVE AND RULED HIS SLIGHTEST ACTIONS
IN GENERAL THEY CONSPIRED
TO REGULATE THE CONDUCT OF HIS LIFE THEY TURNED HIM TOWARDS THE GLOOM
THEY RENDERED HIM KINDLY AND SIMPLE THEY COUNSELLED HIM TO THE SAME
THINGS
SOMETIMES HOWEVER THEY CONFLICTED
IN THAT CASE AS THE READER
WILL REMEMBER THE MAN WHOM ALL THE COUNTRY OF M
SUR M
CALLED M
MADELEINE DID NOT HESITATE TO SACRIFICE THE FIRST TO THE SECOND HIS
SECURITY TO HIS VIRTUE
THUS IN SPITE OF ALL HIS RESERVE AND ALL HIS
PRUDENCE HE HAD PRESERVED THE BISHOP'S CANDLESTICKS WORN MOURNING FOR
HIM SUMMONED AND INTERROGATED ALL THE LITTLE SAVOYARDS WHO PASSED THAT
WAY COLLECTED INFORMATION REGARDING THE FAMILIES AT FAVEROLLES AND
SAVED OLD FAUCHELEVENT'S LIFE DESPITE THE DISQUIETING INSINUATIONS OF
JAVERT
IT SEEMED AS WE HAVE ALREADY REMARKED AS THOUGH HE THOUGHT
FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WISE HOLY AND JUST
THAT HIS FIRST DUTY WAS NOT TOWARDS HIMSELF
AT THE SAME TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED NOTHING JUST LIKE THIS HAD YET
PRESENTED ITSELF
NEVER HAD THE TWO IDEAS WHICH GOVERNED THE UNHAPPY MAN WHOSE SUFFERINGS
WE ARE NARRATING ENGAGED IN SO SERIOUS A STRUGGLE
HE UNDERSTOOD THIS
CONFUSEDLY BUT PROFOUNDLY AT THE VERY FIRST WORDS PRONOUNCED BY JAVERT
WHEN THE LATTER ENTERED HIS STUDY
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THAT NAME WHICH
HE HAD BURIED BENEATH SO MANY LAYERS WAS SO STRANGELY ARTICULATED
HE WAS STRUCK WITH STUPOR AND AS THOUGH INTOXICATED WITH THE SINISTER
ECCENTRICITY OF HIS DESTINY AND THROUGH THIS STUPOR HE FELT THAT
SHUDDER WHICH PRECEDES GREAT SHOCKS
HE BENT LIKE AN OAK AT THE APPROACH
OF A STORM LIKE A SOLDIER AT THE APPROACH OF AN ASSAULT
HE FELT
SHADOWS FILLED WITH THUNDERS AND LIGHTNINGS DESCENDING UPON HIS HEAD
AS HE LISTENED TO JAVERT THE FIRST THOUGHT WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM WAS TO
GO TO RUN AND DENOUNCE HIMSELF TO TAKE THAT CHAMPMATHIEU OUT OF PRISON
AND PLACE HIMSELF THERE THIS WAS AS PAINFUL AND AS POIGNANT AS AN
INCISION IN THE LIVING FLESH
THEN IT PASSED AWAY AND HE SAID TO
HIMSELF WE WILL SEE WE WILL SEE HE REPRESSED THIS FIRST GENEROUS
INSTINCT AND RECOILED BEFORE HEROISM
IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL NO DOUBT AFTER THE BISHOP'S HOLY WORDS AFTER
SO MANY YEARS OF REPENTANCE AND ABNEGATION IN THE MIDST OF A PENITENCE
ADMIRABLY BEGUN IF THIS MAN HAD NOT FLINCHED FOR AN INSTANT EVEN IN
THE PRESENCE OF SO TERRIBLE A CONJECTURE BUT HAD CONTINUED TO WALK WITH
THE SAME STEP TOWARDS THIS YAWNING PRECIPICE AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
LAY HEAVEN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS NOT THUS
WE MUST
RENDER AN ACCOUNT OF THE THINGS WHICH WENT ON IN THIS SOUL AND WE CAN
ONLY TELL WHAT THERE WAS THERE
HE WAS CARRIED AWAY AT FIRST BY
THE INSTINCT OF SELF PRESERVATION HE RALLIED ALL HIS IDEAS IN HASTE
STIFLED HIS EMOTIONS TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION JAVERT'S PRESENCE THAT
GREAT DANGER POSTPONED ALL DECISION WITH THE FIRMNESS OF TERROR SHOOK
OFF THOUGHT AS TO WHAT HE HAD TO DO AND RESUMED HIS CALMNESS AS A
WARRIOR PICKS UP HIS BUCKLER
HE REMAINED IN THIS STATE DURING THE REST OF THE DAY A WHIRLWIND
WITHIN A PROFOUND TRANQUILLITY WITHOUT
HE TOOK NO PRESERVATIVE
MEASURES AS THEY MAY BE CALLED
EVERYTHING WAS STILL CONFUSED AND
JOSTLING TOGETHER IN HIS BRAIN
HIS TROUBLE WAS SO GREAT THAT HE COULD
NOT PERCEIVE THE FORM OF A SINGLE IDEA DISTINCTLY AND HE COULD HAVE
TOLD NOTHING ABOUT HIMSELF EXCEPT THAT HE HAD RECEIVED A GREAT BLOW
HE REPAIRED TO FANTINE'S BED OF SUFFERING AS USUAL AND PROLONGED HIS
VISIT THROUGH A KINDLY INSTINCT TELLING HIMSELF THAT HE MUST BEHAVE
THUS AND RECOMMEND HER WELL TO THE SISTERS IN CASE HE SHOULD BE
OBLIGED TO BE ABSENT HIMSELF
HE HAD A VAGUE FEELING THAT HE MIGHT BE
OBLIGED TO GO TO ARRAS AND WITHOUT HAVING THE LEAST IN THE WORLD MADE
UP HIS MIND TO THIS TRIP HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT BEING AS HE WAS
BEYOND THE SHADOW OF ANY SUSPICION THERE COULD BE NOTHING OUT OF THE
WAY IN BEING A WITNESS TO WHAT WAS TO TAKE PLACE AND HE ENGAGED THE
TILBURY FROM SCAUFFLAIRE IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED IN ANY EVENT
HE DINED WITH A GOOD DEAL OF APPETITE
ON RETURNING TO HIS ROOM HE COMMUNED WITH HIMSELF
HE EXAMINED THE SITUATION AND FOUND IT UNPRECEDENTED SO UNPRECEDENTED
THAT IN THE MIDST OF HIS REVERY HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR MOVED BY SOME
INEXPLICABLE IMPULSE OF ANXIETY AND BOLTED HIS DOOR
HE FEARED
LEST SOMETHING MORE SHOULD ENTER
HE WAS BARRICADING HIMSELF AGAINST
POSSIBILITIES
A MOMENT LATER HE EXTINGUISHED HIS LIGHT IT EMBARRASSED HIM
IT SEEMED TO HIM AS THOUGH HE MIGHT BE SEEN
BY WHOM
ALAS THAT ON WHICH HE DESIRED TO CLOSE THE DOOR HAD ALREADY ENTERED
THAT WHICH HE DESIRED TO BLIND WAS STARING HIM IN THE FACE HIS
CONSCIENCE
HIS CONSCIENCE THAT IS TO SAY GOD
NEVERTHELESS HE DELUDED HIMSELF AT FIRST HE HAD A FEELING OF SECURITY
AND OF SOLITUDE THE BOLT ONCE DRAWN HE THOUGHT HIMSELF IMPREGNABLE
THE CANDLE EXTINGUISHED HE FELT HIMSELF INVISIBLE
THEN HE TOOK
POSSESSION OF HIMSELF HE SET HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE LEANED HIS HEAD
ON HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO MEDITATE IN THE DARK
WHERE DO I STAND AM NOT I DREAMING WHAT HAVE I HEARD IS IT REALLY
TRUE THAT I HAVE SEEN THAT JAVERT AND THAT HE SPOKE TO ME IN THAT
MANNER WHO CAN THAT CHAMPMATHIEU BE SO HE RESEMBLES ME IS IT
POSSIBLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT YESTERDAY I WAS SO TRANQUIL AND SO FAR
FROM SUSPECTING ANYTHING WHAT WAS I DOING YESTERDAY AT THIS HOUR WHAT
IS THERE IN THIS INCIDENT WHAT WILL THE END BE WHAT IS TO BE DONE
THIS WAS THE TORMENT IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF
HIS BRAIN HAD LOST ITS
POWER OF RETAINING IDEAS THEY PASSED LIKE WAVES AND HE CLUTCHED HIS
BROW IN BOTH HANDS TO ARREST THEM
NOTHING BUT ANGUISH EXTRICATED ITSELF FROM THIS TUMULT WHICH OVERWHELMED
HIS WILL AND HIS REASON AND FROM WHICH HE SOUGHT TO DRAW PROOF AND
RESOLUTION
HIS HEAD WAS BURNING
HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND THREW IT WIDE OPEN
THERE WERE NO STARS IN THE SKY
HE RETURNED AND SEATED HIMSELF AT THE
TABLE
THE FIRST HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER
GRADUALLY HOWEVER VAGUE OUTLINES BEGAN TO TAKE FORM AND TO FIX
THEMSELVES IN HIS MEDITATION AND HE WAS ABLE TO CATCH A GLIMPSE WITH
PRECISION OF THE REALITY NOT THE WHOLE SITUATION BUT SOME OF
THE DETAILS
HE BEGAN BY RECOGNIZING THE FACT THAT CRITICAL AND
EXTRAORDINARY AS WAS THIS SITUATION HE WAS COMPLETELY MASTER OF IT
THIS ONLY CAUSED AN INCREASE OF HIS STUPOR
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SEVERE AND RELIGIOUS AIM WHICH HE HAD ASSIGNED TO
HIS ACTIONS ALL THAT HE HAD MADE UP TO THAT DAY HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT A
HOLE IN WHICH TO BURY HIS NAME
THAT WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS FEARED MOST OF
ALL IN HIS HOURS OF SELF COMMUNION DURING HIS SLEEPLESS NIGHTS WAS TO
EVER HEAR THAT NAME PRONOUNCED HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THAT WOULD
BE THE END OF ALL THINGS FOR HIM THAT ON THE DAY WHEN THAT NAME MADE
ITS REAPPEARANCE IT WOULD CAUSE HIS NEW LIFE TO VANISH FROM ABOUT
HIM AND WHO KNOWS PERHAPS EVEN HIS NEW SOUL WITHIN HIM ALSO
HE
SHUDDERED AT THE VERY THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLE
ASSUREDLY IF ANY
ONE HAD SAID TO HIM AT SUCH MOMENTS THAT THE HOUR WOULD COME WHEN THAT
NAME WOULD RING IN HIS EARS WHEN THE HIDEOUS WORDS JEAN VALJEAN WOULD
SUDDENLY EMERGE FROM THE DARKNESS AND RISE IN FRONT OF HIM WHEN THAT
FORMIDABLE LIGHT CAPABLE OF DISSIPATING THE MYSTERY IN WHICH HE HAD
ENVELOPED HIMSELF WOULD SUDDENLY BLAZE FORTH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND THAT
THAT NAME WOULD NOT MENACE HIM THAT THAT LIGHT WOULD BUT PRODUCE
AN OBSCURITY MORE DENSE THAT THIS RENT VEIL WOULD BUT INCREASE THE
MYSTERY THAT THIS EARTHQUAKE WOULD SOLIDIFY HIS EDIFICE THAT THIS
PRODIGIOUS INCIDENT WOULD HAVE NO OTHER RESULT SO FAR AS HE WAS
CONCERNED IF SO IT SEEMED GOOD TO HIM THAN THAT OF RENDERING HIS
EXISTENCE AT ONCE CLEARER AND MORE IMPENETRABLE AND THAT OUT OF HIS
CONFRONTATION WITH THE PHANTOM OF JEAN VALJEAN THE GOOD AND WORTHY
CITIZEN MONSIEUR MADELEINE WOULD EMERGE MORE HONORED MORE PEACEFUL AND
MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE
TOSSED HIS HEAD AND REGARDED THE WORDS AS THOSE OF A MADMAN
WELL ALL
THIS WAS PRECISELY WHAT HAD JUST COME TO PASS ALL THAT ACCUMULATION OF
IMPOSSIBILITIES WAS A FACT AND GOD HAD PERMITTED THESE WILD FANCIES TO
BECOME REAL THINGS
HIS REVERY CONTINUED TO GROW CLEARER
HE CAME MORE AND MORE TO AN
UNDERSTANDING OF HIS POSITION
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD BUT JUST WAKED UP FROM SOME INEXPLICABLE
DREAM AND THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF SLIPPING DOWN A DECLIVITY IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT ERECT SHIVERING HOLDING BACK ALL IN VAIN ON THE VERY
BRINK OF THE ABYSS
HE DISTINCTLY PERCEIVED IN THE DARKNESS A STRANGER
A MAN UNKNOWN TO HIM WHOM DESTINY HAD MISTAKEN FOR HIM AND WHOM SHE
WAS THRUSTING INTO THE GULF IN HIS STEAD IN ORDER THAT THE GULF MIGHT
CLOSE ONCE MORE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT SOME ONE HIMSELF OR THAT OTHER
MAN SHOULD FALL INTO IT HE HAD ONLY LET THINGS TAKE THEIR COURSE
THE LIGHT BECAME COMPLETE AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS TO HIMSELF THAT
HIS PLACE WAS EMPTY IN THE GALLEYS THAT DO WHAT HE WOULD IT WAS STILL
AWAITING HIM THAT THE THEFT FROM LITTLE GERVAIS HAD LED HIM BACK TO IT
THAT THIS VACANT PLACE WOULD AWAIT HIM AND DRAW HIM ON UNTIL HE FILLED
IT THAT THIS WAS INEVITABLE AND FATAL AND THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THAT AT THIS MOMENT HE HAD A SUBSTITUTE THAT IT APPEARED THAT A
CERTAIN CHAMPMATHIEU HAD THAT ILL LUCK AND THAT AS REGARDS HIMSELF
BEING PRESENT IN THE GALLEYS IN THE PERSON OF THAT CHAMPMATHIEU PRESENT
IN SOCIETY UNDER THE NAME OF M
MADELEINE HE HAD NOTHING MORE TO FEAR
PROVIDED THAT HE DID NOT PREVENT MEN FROM SEALING OVER THE HEAD OF
THAT CHAMPMATHIEU THIS STONE OF INFAMY WHICH LIKE THE STONE OF THE
SEPULCHRE FALLS ONCE NEVER TO RISE AGAIN
ALL THIS WAS SO STRANGE AND SO VIOLENT THAT THERE SUDDENLY TOOK PLACE
IN HIM THAT INDESCRIBABLE MOVEMENT WHICH NO MAN FEELS MORE THAN TWO
OR THREE TIMES IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE A SORT OF CONVULSION OF THE
CONSCIENCE WHICH STIRS UP ALL THAT THERE IS DOUBTFUL IN THE HEART WHICH
IS COMPOSED OF IRONY OF JOY AND OF DESPAIR AND WHICH MAY BE CALLED AN
OUTBURST OF INWARD LAUGHTER
HE HASTILY RELIGHTED HIS CANDLE
WELL WHAT THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF WHAT AM I AFRAID OF WHAT IS
THERE IN ALL THAT FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT I AM SAFE ALL IS OVER
I HAD
BUT ONE PARTLY OPEN DOOR THROUGH WHICH MY PAST MIGHT INVADE MY LIFE
AND BEHOLD THAT DOOR IS WALLED UP FOREVER THAT JAVERT WHO HAS BEEN
ANNOYING ME SO LONG THAT TERRIBLE INSTINCT WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE DIVINED
ME WHICH HAD DIVINED ME GOOD GOD AND WHICH FOLLOWED ME EVERYWHERE
THAT FRIGHTFUL HUNTING DOG ALWAYS MAKING A POINT AT ME IS THROWN
OFF THE SCENT ENGAGED ELSEWHERE ABSOLUTELY TURNED FROM THE TRAIL
HENCEFORTH HE IS SATISFIED HE WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE HE HAS HIS JEAN
VALJEAN
WHO KNOWS IT IS EVEN PROBABLE THAT HE WILL WISH TO LEAVE TOWN
AND ALL THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT WITHOUT ANY AID FROM ME AND I COUNT
FOR NOTHING IN IT AH BUT WHERE IS THE MISFORTUNE IN THIS UPON MY
HONOR PEOPLE WOULD THINK TO SEE ME THAT SOME CATASTROPHE HAD HAPPENED
TO ME AFTER ALL IF IT DOES BRING HARM TO SOME ONE THAT IS NOT MY
FAULT IN THE LEAST IT IS PROVIDENCE WHICH HAS DONE IT ALL IT IS
BECAUSE IT WISHES IT SO TO BE EVIDENTLY
HAVE I THE RIGHT TO DISARRANGE
WHAT IT HAS ARRANGED WHAT DO I ASK NOW WHY SHOULD I MEDDLE IT DOES
NOT CONCERN ME WHAT I AM NOT SATISFIED BUT WHAT MORE DO I WANT THE
GOAL TO WHICH I HAVE ASPIRED FOR SO MANY YEARS THE DREAM OF MY NIGHTS
THE OBJECT OF MY PRAYERS TO HEAVEN SECURITY I HAVE NOW ATTAINED IT
IS GOD WHO WILLS IT I CAN DO NOTHING AGAINST THE WILL OF GOD AND WHY
DOES GOD WILL IT IN ORDER THAT I MAY CONTINUE WHAT I HAVE BEGUN THAT I
MAY DO GOOD THAT I MAY ONE DAY BE A GRAND AND ENCOURAGING EXAMPLE THAT
IT MAY BE SAID AT LAST THAT A LITTLE HAPPINESS HAS BEEN ATTACHED TO
THE PENANCE WHICH I HAVE UNDERGONE AND TO THAT VIRTUE TO WHICH I HAVE
RETURNED
REALLY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS AFRAID A LITTLE WHILE
AGO TO ENTER THE HOUSE OF THAT GOOD CURE AND TO ASK HIS ADVICE THIS
IS EVIDENTLY WHAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO ME IT IS SETTLED LET THINGS
TAKE THEIR COURSE LET THE GOOD GOD DO AS HE LIKES
THUS DID HE ADDRESS HIMSELF IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS OWN CONSCIENCE BENDING
OVER WHAT MAY BE CALLED HIS OWN ABYSS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND BEGAN
TO PACE THE ROOM COME SAID HE LET US THINK NO MORE ABOUT IT MY
RESOLVE IS TAKEN BUT HE FELT NO JOY
QUITE THE REVERSE
ONE CAN NO MORE PREVENT THOUGHT FROM RECURRING TO AN IDEA THAN ONE CAN
THE SEA FROM RETURNING TO THE SHORE THE SAILOR CALLS IT THE TIDE THE
GUILTY MAN CALLS IT REMORSE GOD UPHEAVES THE SOUL AS HE DOES THE OCEAN
AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MOMENTS DO WHAT HE WOULD HE RESUMED THE
GLOOMY DIALOGUE IN WHICH IT WAS HE WHO SPOKE AND HE WHO LISTENED SAYING
THAT WHICH HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO IGNORE AND LISTENED TO THAT WHICH
HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED NOT TO HEAR YIELDING TO THAT MYSTERIOUS POWER
WHICH SAID TO HIM THINK AS IT SAID TO ANOTHER CONDEMNED MAN TWO
THOUSAND YEARS AGO MARCH ON
BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER AND IN ORDER TO MAKE OURSELVES FULLY
UNDERSTOOD LET US INSIST UPON ONE NECESSARY OBSERVATION
IT IS CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE DO TALK TO THEMSELVES THERE IS NO LIVING
BEING WHO HAS NOT DONE IT
IT MAY EVEN BE SAID THAT THE WORD IS NEVER
A MORE MAGNIFICENT MYSTERY THAN WHEN IT GOES FROM THOUGHT TO CONSCIENCE
WITHIN A MAN AND WHEN IT RETURNS FROM CONSCIENCE TO THOUGHT IT IS IN
THIS SENSE ONLY THAT THE WORDS SO OFTEN EMPLOYED IN THIS CHAPTER HE
SAID HE EXCLAIMED MUST BE UNDERSTOOD ONE SPEAKS TO ONE'S SELF TALKS
TO ONE'S SELF EXCLAIMS TO ONE'S SELF WITHOUT BREAKING THE EXTERNAL
SILENCE THERE IS A GREAT TUMULT EVERYTHING ABOUT US TALKS EXCEPT THE
MOUTH
THE REALITIES OF THE SOUL ARE NONE THE LESS REALITIES BECAUSE
THEY ARE NOT VISIBLE AND PALPABLE
SO HE ASKED HIMSELF WHERE HE STOOD
HE INTERROGATED HIMSELF UPON THAT
SETTLED RESOLVE HE CONFESSED TO HIMSELF THAT ALL THAT HE HAD JUST
ARRANGED IN HIS MIND WAS MONSTROUS THAT TO LET THINGS TAKE THEIR
COURSE TO LET THE GOOD GOD DO AS HE LIKED WAS SIMPLY HORRIBLE TO
ALLOW THIS ERROR OF FATE AND OF MEN TO BE CARRIED OUT NOT TO HINDER IT
TO LEND HIMSELF TO IT THROUGH HIS SILENCE TO DO NOTHING IN SHORT
WAS TO DO EVERYTHING THAT THIS WAS HYPOCRITICAL BASENESS IN THE LAST
DEGREE THAT IT WAS A BASE COWARDLY SNEAKING ABJECT HIDEOUS CRIME
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT YEARS THE WRETCHED MAN HAD JUST TASTED THE
BITTER SAVOR OF AN EVIL THOUGHT AND OF AN EVIL ACTION
HE SPIT IT OUT WITH DISGUST
HE CONTINUED TO QUESTION HIMSELF
HE ASKED HIMSELF SEVERELY WHAT HE HAD
MEANT BY THIS MY OBJECT IS ATTAINED HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT
HIS LIFE REALLY HAD AN OBJECT BUT WHAT OBJECT TO CONCEAL HIS NAME
TO DECEIVE THE POLICE WAS IT FOR SO PETTY A THING THAT HE HAD DONE ALL
THAT HE HAD DONE HAD HE NOT ANOTHER AND A GRAND OBJECT WHICH WAS THE
TRUE ONE TO SAVE NOT HIS PERSON BUT HIS SOUL TO BECOME HONEST AND
GOOD ONCE MORE TO BE A JUST MAN WAS IT NOT THAT ABOVE ALL THAT ALONE
WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS DESIRED WHICH THE BISHOP HAD ENJOINED UPON HIM TO
SHUT THE DOOR ON HIS PAST BUT HE WAS NOT SHUTTING IT GREAT GOD HE WAS
RE OPENING IT BY COMMITTING AN INFAMOUS ACTION HE WAS BECOMING A THIEF
ONCE MORE AND THE MOST ODIOUS OF THIEVES HE WAS ROBBING ANOTHER OF
HIS EXISTENCE HIS LIFE HIS PEACE HIS PLACE IN THE SUNSHINE
HE WAS
BECOMING AN ASSASSIN
HE WAS MURDERING MORALLY MURDERING A WRETCHED
MAN
HE WAS INFLICTING ON HIM THAT FRIGHTFUL LIVING DEATH THAT DEATH
BENEATH THE OPEN SKY WHICH IS CALLED THE GALLEYS
ON THE OTHER HAND
TO SURRENDER HIMSELF TO SAVE THAT MAN STRUCK DOWN WITH SO MELANCHOLY
AN ERROR TO RESUME HIS OWN NAME TO BECOME ONCE MORE OUT OF DUTY THE
CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN THAT WAS IN TRUTH TO ACHIEVE HIS RESURRECTION
AND TO CLOSE FOREVER THAT HELL WHENCE HE HAD JUST EMERGED TO FALL BACK
THERE IN APPEARANCE WAS TO ESCAPE FROM IT IN REALITY
THIS MUST BE
DONE HE HAD DONE NOTHING IF HE DID NOT DO ALL THIS HIS WHOLE LIFE WAS
USELESS ALL HIS PENITENCE WAS WASTED
THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY NEED OF
SAYING WHAT IS THE USE HE FELT THAT THE BISHOP WAS THERE THAT THE
BISHOP WAS PRESENT ALL THE MORE BECAUSE HE WAS DEAD THAT THE BISHOP
WAS GAZING FIXEDLY AT HIM THAT HENCEFORTH MAYOR MADELEINE WITH ALL HIS
VIRTUES WOULD BE ABOMINABLE TO HIM AND THAT THE CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN
WOULD BE PURE AND ADMIRABLE IN HIS SIGHT THAT MEN BEHELD HIS MASK BUT
THAT THE BISHOP SAW HIS FACE THAT MEN SAW HIS LIFE BUT THAT THE BISHOP
BEHELD HIS CONSCIENCE
SO HE MUST GO TO ARRAS DELIVER THE FALSE JEAN
VALJEAN AND DENOUNCE THE REAL ONE
ALAS THAT WAS THE GREATEST OF
SACRIFICES THE MOST POIGNANT OF VICTORIES THE LAST STEP TO TAKE BUT
IT MUST BE DONE
SAD FATE HE WOULD ENTER INTO SANCTITY ONLY IN THE EYES
OF GOD WHEN HE RETURNED TO INFAMY IN THE EYES OF MEN
WELL SAID HE LET US DECIDE UPON THIS LET US DO OUR DUTY LET US
SAVE THIS MAN HE UTTERED THESE WORDS ALOUD WITHOUT PERCEIVING THAT HE
WAS SPEAKING ALOUD
HE TOOK HIS BOOKS VERIFIED THEM AND PUT THEM IN ORDER
HE FLUNG IN
THE FIRE A BUNDLE OF BILLS WHICH HE HAD AGAINST PETTY AND EMBARRASSED
TRADESMEN
HE WROTE AND SEALED A LETTER AND ON THE ENVELOPE IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN READ HAD THERE BEEN ANY ONE IN HIS CHAMBER AT THE MOMENT
TO MONSIEUR LAFFITTE BANKER RUE D'ARTOIS PARIS
HE DREW FROM HIS
SECRETARY A POCKET BOOK WHICH CONTAINED SEVERAL BANK NOTES AND THE
PASSPORT OF WHICH HE HAD MADE USE THAT SAME YEAR WHEN HE WENT TO THE
ELECTIONS
ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN HIM DURING THE EXECUTION OF THESE VARIOUS ACTS
INTO WHICH THERE ENTERED SUCH GRAVE THOUGHT WOULD HAVE HAD NO SUSPICION
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITHIN HIM
ONLY OCCASIONALLY DID HIS LIPS MOVE AT
OTHER TIMES HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND FIXED HIS GAZE UPON SOME POINT OF THE
WALL AS THOUGH THERE EXISTED AT THAT POINT SOMETHING WHICH HE WISHED TO
ELUCIDATE OR INTERROGATE
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THE LETTER TO M
LAFFITTE HE PUT IT INTO HIS
POCKET TOGETHER WITH THE POCKET BOOK AND BEGAN HIS WALK ONCE MORE
HIS REVERY HAD NOT SWERVED FROM ITS COURSE
HE CONTINUED TO SEE HIS DUTY
CLEARLY WRITTEN IN LUMINOUS LETTERS WHICH FLAMED BEFORE HIS EYES AND
CHANGED ITS PLACE AS HE ALTERED THE DIRECTION OF HIS GLANCE
GO TELL YOUR NAME DENOUNCE YOURSELF
IN THE SAME WAY HE BEHELD AS THOUGH THEY HAD PASSED BEFORE HIM IN
VISIBLE FORMS THE TWO IDEAS WHICH HAD UP TO THAT TIME FORMED
THE DOUBLE RULE OF HIS SOUL THE CONCEALMENT OF HIS NAME THE
SANCTIFICATION OF HIS LIFE
FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY APPEARED TO HIM AS
ABSOLUTELY DISTINCT AND HE PERCEIVED THE DISTANCE WHICH SEPARATED THEM
HE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT ONE OF THESE IDEAS WAS NECESSARILY GOOD
WHILE THE OTHER MIGHT BECOME BAD THAT THE FIRST WAS SELF DEVOTION AND
THAT THE OTHER WAS PERSONALITY THAT THE ONE SAID MY NEIGHBOR AND THAT
THE OTHER SAID MYSELF THAT ONE EMANATED FROM THE LIGHT AND THE OTHER
FROM DARKNESS
THEY WERE ANTAGONISTIC
HE SAW THEM IN CONFLICT
IN PROPORTION AS
HE MEDITATED THEY GREW BEFORE THE EYES OF HIS SPIRIT
THEY HAD NOW
ATTAINED COLOSSAL STATURES AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE BEHELD WITHIN
HIMSELF IN THAT INFINITY OF WHICH WE WERE RECENTLY SPEAKING IN THE
MIDST OF THE DARKNESS AND THE LIGHTS A GODDESS AND A GIANT CONTENDING
HE WAS FILLED WITH TERROR BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE GOOD THOUGHT
WAS GETTING THE UPPER HAND
HE FELT THAT HE WAS ON THE BRINK OF THE SECOND DECISIVE CRISIS OF HIS
CONSCIENCE AND OF HIS DESTINY THAT THE BISHOP HAD MARKED THE FIRST
PHASE OF HIS NEW LIFE AND THAT CHAMPMATHIEU MARKED THE SECOND
AFTER
THE GRAND CRISIS THE GRAND TEST
BUT THE FEVER ALLAYED FOR AN INSTANT GRADUALLY RESUMED POSSESSION
OF HIM
A THOUSAND THOUGHTS TRAVERSED HIS MIND BUT THEY CONTINUED TO
FORTIFY HIM IN HIS RESOLUTION
ONE MOMENT HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS PERHAPS TAKING THE MATTER
TOO KEENLY THAT AFTER ALL THIS CHAMPMATHIEU WAS NOT INTERESTING AND
THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN GUILTY OF THEFT
HE ANSWERED HIMSELF IF THIS MAN HAS INDEED STOLEN A FEW APPLES THAT
MEANS A MONTH IN PRISON
IT IS A LONG WAY FROM THAT TO THE GALLEYS
AND
WHO KNOWS DID HE STEAL HAS IT BEEN PROVED THE NAME OF JEAN VALJEAN
OVERWHELMS HIM AND SEEMS TO DISPENSE WITH PROOFS
DO NOT THE ATTORNEYS
FOR THE CROWN ALWAYS PROCEED IN THIS MANNER HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A
THIEF BECAUSE HE IS KNOWN TO BE A CONVICT
IN ANOTHER INSTANT THE THOUGHT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THAT WHEN HE
DENOUNCED HIMSELF THE HEROISM OF HIS DEED MIGHT PERHAPS BE TAKEN INTO
CONSIDERATION AND HIS HONEST LIFE FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AND WHAT HE
HAD DONE FOR THE DISTRICT AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE MERCY ON HIM
BUT THIS SUPPOSITION VANISHED VERY QUICKLY AND HE SMILED BITTERLY AS HE
REMEMBERED THAT THE THEFT OF THE FORTY SOUS FROM LITTLE GERVAIS PUT HIM
IN THE POSITION OF A MAN GUILTY OF A SECOND OFFENCE AFTER CONVICTION
THAT THIS AFFAIR WOULD CERTAINLY COME UP AND ACCORDING TO THE PRECISE
TERMS OF THE LAW WOULD RENDER HIM LIABLE TO PENAL SERVITUDE FOR LIFE
HE TURNED ASIDE FROM ALL ILLUSIONS DETACHED HIMSELF MORE AND MORE FROM
EARTH AND SOUGHT STRENGTH AND CONSOLATION ELSEWHERE
HE TOLD HIMSELF
THAT HE MUST DO HIS DUTY THAT PERHAPS HE SHOULD NOT BE MORE UNHAPPY
AFTER DOING HIS DUTY THAN AFTER HAVING AVOIDED IT THAT IF HE ALLOWED
THINGS TO TAKE THEIR OWN COURSE IF HE REMAINED AT M
SUR M HIS
CONSIDERATION HIS GOOD NAME HIS GOOD WORKS THE DEFERENCE AND
VENERATION PAID TO HIM HIS CHARITY HIS WEALTH HIS POPULARITY HIS
VIRTUE WOULD BE SEASONED WITH A CRIME
AND WHAT WOULD BE THE TASTE OF
ALL THESE HOLY THINGS WHEN BOUND UP WITH THIS HIDEOUS THING WHILE IF
HE ACCOMPLISHED HIS SACRIFICE A CELESTIAL IDEA WOULD BE MINGLED WITH
THE GALLEYS THE POST THE IRON NECKLET THE GREEN CAP UNCEASING TOIL
AND PITILESS SHAME
AT LENGTH HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT MUST BE SO THAT HIS DESTINY WAS THUS
ALLOTTED THAT HE HAD NOT AUTHORITY TO ALTER THE ARRANGEMENTS MADE ON
HIGH THAT IN ANY CASE HE MUST MAKE HIS CHOICE VIRTUE WITHOUT AND
ABOMINATION WITHIN OR HOLINESS WITHIN AND INFAMY WITHOUT
THE STIRRING UP OF THESE LUGUBRIOUS IDEAS DID NOT CAUSE HIS COURAGE TO
FAIL BUT HIS BRAIN GROW WEARY
HE BEGAN TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS OF
INDIFFERENT MATTERS IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
THE VEINS IN HIS TEMPLES THROBBED VIOLENTLY HE STILL PACED TO AND FRO
MIDNIGHT SOUNDED FIRST FROM THE PARISH CHURCH THEN FROM THE TOWN HALL
HE COUNTED THE TWELVE STROKES OF THE TWO CLOCKS AND COMPARED THE SOUNDS
OF THE TWO BELLS HE RECALLED IN THIS CONNECTION THE FACT THAT A FEW
DAYS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD SEEN IN AN IRONMONGER'S SHOP AN ANCIENT CLOCK
FOR SALE UPON WHICH WAS WRITTEN THE NAME ANTOINE ALBIN DE ROMAINVILLE
HE WAS COLD HE LIGHTED A SMALL FIRE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM TO CLOSE
THE WINDOW
IN THE MEANTIME HE HAD RELAPSED INTO HIS STUPOR HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE
A TOLERABLY VIGOROUS EFFORT TO RECALL WHAT HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF HIS
THOUGHTS BEFORE MIDNIGHT HAD STRUCK HE FINALLY SUCCEEDED IN DOING THIS
AH YES HE SAID TO HIMSELF I HAD RESOLVED TO INFORM AGAINST
MYSELF
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE THOUGHT OF FANTINE
HOLD SAID HE AND WHAT ABOUT THAT POOR WOMAN
HERE A FRESH CRISIS DECLARED ITSELF
FANTINE BY APPEARING THUS ABRUPTLY IN HIS REVERY PRODUCED THE EFFECT
OF AN UNEXPECTED RAY OF LIGHT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS THOUGH EVERYTHING
ABOUT HIM WERE UNDERGOING A CHANGE OF ASPECT HE EXCLAIMED
AH BUT I HAVE HITHERTO CONSIDERED NO ONE BUT MYSELF IT IS PROPER FOR
ME TO HOLD MY TONGUE OR TO DENOUNCE MYSELF TO CONCEAL MY PERSON OR
TO SAVE MY SOUL TO BE A DESPICABLE AND RESPECTED MAGISTRATE OR AN
INFAMOUS AND VENERABLE CONVICT IT IS I IT IS ALWAYS I AND NOTHING
BUT I BUT GOOD GOD ALL THIS IS EGOTISM THESE ARE DIVERSE FORMS
OF EGOTISM BUT IT IS EGOTISM ALL THE SAME
WHAT IF I WERE TO THINK A
LITTLE ABOUT OTHERS THE HIGHEST HOLINESS IS TO THINK OF OTHERS COME
LET US EXAMINE THE MATTER
THE I EXCEPTED THE I EFFACED THE I
FORGOTTEN WHAT WOULD BE THE RESULT OF ALL THIS WHAT IF I DENOUNCE
MYSELF I AM ARRESTED THIS CHAMPMATHIEU IS RELEASED I AM PUT BACK IN
THE GALLEYS THAT IS WELL AND WHAT THEN WHAT IS GOING ON HERE AH
HERE IS A COUNTRY A TOWN HERE ARE FACTORIES AN INDUSTRY WORKERS
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AGED GRANDSIRES CHILDREN POOR PEOPLE ALL THIS I
HAVE CREATED ALL THESE I PROVIDE WITH THEIR LIVING EVERYWHERE WHERE
THERE IS A SMOKING CHIMNEY IT IS I WHO HAVE PLACED THE BRAND ON THE
HEARTH AND MEAT IN THE POT I HAVE CREATED EASE CIRCULATION CREDIT
BEFORE ME THERE WAS NOTHING I HAVE ELEVATED VIVIFIED INFORMED WITH
LIFE FECUNDATED STIMULATED ENRICHED THE WHOLE COUNTRY SIDE LACKING
ME THE SOUL IS LACKING I TAKE MYSELF OFF EVERYTHING DIES AND THIS
WOMAN WHO HAS SUFFERED SO MUCH WHO POSSESSES SO MANY MERITS IN SPITE
OF HER FALL THE CAUSE OF ALL WHOSE MISERY I HAVE UNWITTINGLY BEEN AND
THAT CHILD WHOM I MEANT TO GO IN SEARCH OF WHOM I HAVE PROMISED TO HER
MOTHER DO I NOT ALSO OWE SOMETHING TO THIS WOMAN IN REPARATION FOR
THE EVIL WHICH I HAVE DONE HER IF I DISAPPEAR WHAT HAPPENS THE MOTHER
DIES THE CHILD BECOMES WHAT IT CAN THAT IS WHAT WILL TAKE PLACE IF
I DENOUNCE MYSELF
IF I DO NOT DENOUNCE MYSELF COME LET US SEE HOW IT
WILL BE IF I DO NOT DENOUNCE MYSELF
AFTER PUTTING THIS QUESTION TO HIMSELF HE PAUSED HE SEEMED TO UNDERGO
A MOMENTARY HESITATION AND TREPIDATION BUT IT DID NOT LAST LONG AND HE
ANSWERED HIMSELF CALMLY
WELL THIS MAN IS GOING TO THE GALLEYS IT IS TRUE BUT WHAT THE DEUCE
HE HAS STOLEN THERE IS NO USE IN MY SAYING THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN GUILTY
OF THEFT FOR HE HAS I REMAIN HERE I GO ON IN TEN YEARS I SHALL HAVE
MADE TEN MILLIONS I SCATTER THEM OVER THE COUNTRY I HAVE NOTHING OF
MY OWN WHAT IS THAT TO ME IT IS NOT FOR MYSELF THAT I AM DOING IT
THE PROSPERITY OF ALL GOES ON AUGMENTING INDUSTRIES ARE AROUSED AND
ANIMATED FACTORIES AND SHOPS ARE MULTIPLIED FAMILIES A HUNDRED
FAMILIES A THOUSAND FAMILIES ARE HAPPY THE DISTRICT BECOMES
POPULATED VILLAGES SPRING UP WHERE THERE WERE ONLY FARMS BEFORE
FARMS RISE WHERE THERE WAS NOTHING WRETCHEDNESS DISAPPEARS AND
WITH WRETCHEDNESS DEBAUCHERY PROSTITUTION THEFT MURDER ALL VICES
DISAPPEAR ALL CRIMES AND THIS POOR MOTHER REARS HER CHILD AND BEHOLD
A WHOLE COUNTRY RICH AND HONEST AH I WAS A FOOL I WAS ABSURD
WHAT WAS THAT I WAS SAYING ABOUT DENOUNCING MYSELF I REALLY MUST PAY
ATTENTION AND NOT BE PRECIPITATE ABOUT ANYTHING
WHAT BECAUSE IT WOULD
HAVE PLEASED ME TO PLAY THE GRAND AND GENEROUS THIS IS MELODRAMA AFTER
ALL BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF NO ONE BUT MYSELF THE IDEA FOR
THE SAKE OF SAVING FROM A PUNISHMENT A TRIFLE EXAGGERATED PERHAPS
BUT JUST AT BOTTOM NO ONE KNOWS WHOM A THIEF A GOOD FOR NOTHING
EVIDENTLY A WHOLE COUNTRY SIDE MUST PERISH A POOR WOMAN MUST DIE IN
THE HOSPITAL A POOR LITTLE GIRL MUST DIE IN THE STREET LIKE DOGS AH
THIS IS ABOMINABLE AND WITHOUT THE MOTHER EVEN HAVING SEEN HER CHILD
ONCE MORE ALMOST WITHOUT THE CHILD'S HAVING KNOWN HER MOTHER AND
ALL THAT FOR THE SAKE OF AN OLD WRETCH OF AN APPLE THIEF WHO MOST
ASSUREDLY HAS DESERVED THE GALLEYS FOR SOMETHING ELSE IF NOT FOR
THAT FINE SCRUPLES INDEED WHICH SAVE A GUILTY MAN AND SACRIFICE THE
INNOCENT WHICH SAVE AN OLD VAGABOND WHO HAS ONLY A FEW YEARS TO LIVE AT
MOST AND WHO WILL NOT BE MORE UNHAPPY IN THE GALLEYS THAN IN HIS HOVEL
AND WHICH SACRIFICE A WHOLE POPULATION MOTHERS WIVES CHILDREN
THIS
POOR LITTLE COSETTE WHO HAS NO ONE IN THE WORLD BUT ME AND WHO IS NO
DOUBT BLUE WITH COLD AT THIS MOMENT IN THE DEN OF THOSE THENARDIERS
THOSE PEOPLES ARE RASCALS AND I WAS GOING TO NEGLECT MY DUTY TOWARDS
ALL THESE POOR CREATURES AND I WAS GOING OFF TO DENOUNCE MYSELF AND I
WAS ABOUT TO COMMIT THAT UNSPEAKABLE FOLLY LET US PUT IT AT THE WORST
SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS A WRONG ACTION ON MY PART IN THIS AND THAT MY
CONSCIENCE WILL REPROACH ME FOR IT SOME DAY TO ACCEPT FOR THE GOOD OF
OTHERS THESE REPROACHES WHICH WEIGH ONLY ON MYSELF THIS EVIL ACTION
WHICH COMPROMISES MY SOUL ALONE IN THAT LIES SELF SACRIFICE IN THAT
ALONE THERE IS VIRTUE
HE ROSE AND RESUMED HIS MARCH THIS TIME HE SEEMED TO BE CONTENT
DIAMONDS ARE FOUND ONLY IN THE DARK PLACES OF THE EARTH TRUTHS ARE
FOUND ONLY IN THE DEPTHS OF THOUGHT
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT AFTER
HAVING DESCENDED INTO THESE DEPTHS AFTER HAVING LONG GROPED AMONG THE
DARKEST OF THESE SHADOWS HE HAD AT LAST FOUND ONE OF THESE DIAMONDS
ONE OF THESE TRUTHS AND THAT HE NOW HELD IT IN HIS HAND AND HE WAS
DAZZLED AS HE GAZED UPON IT
YES HE THOUGHT THIS IS RIGHT I AM ON THE RIGHT ROAD I HAVE THE
SOLUTION I MUST END BY HOLDING FAST TO SOMETHING MY RESOLVE IS TAKEN
LET THINGS TAKE THEIR COURSE LET US NO LONGER VACILLATE LET US NO
LONGER HANG BACK THIS IS FOR THE INTEREST OF ALL NOT FOR MY OWN I AM
MADELEINE AND MADELEINE I REMAIN
WOE TO THE MAN WHO IS JEAN VALJEAN
I AM NO LONGER HE I DO NOT KNOW THAT MAN I NO LONGER KNOW ANYTHING IT
TURNS OUT THAT SOME ONE IS JEAN VALJEAN AT THE PRESENT MOMENT LET HIM
LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF THAT DOES NOT CONCERN ME IT IS A FATAL NAME WHICH
WAS FLOATING ABROAD IN THE NIGHT IF IT HALTS AND DESCENDS ON A HEAD SO
MUCH THE WORSE FOR THAT HEAD
HE LOOKED INTO THE LITTLE MIRROR WHICH HUNG ABOVE HIS CHIMNEY PIECE AND
SAID
HOLD IT HAS RELIEVED ME TO COME TO A DECISION I AM QUITE ANOTHER MAN
NOW
HE PROCEEDED A FEW PACES FURTHER THEN HE STOPPED SHORT
COME HE SAID I MUST NOT FLINCH BEFORE ANY OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF
THE RESOLUTION WHICH I HAVE ONCE ADOPTED THERE ARE STILL THREADS WHICH
ATTACH ME TO THAT JEAN VALJEAN THEY MUST BE BROKEN IN THIS VERY ROOM
THERE ARE OBJECTS WHICH WOULD BETRAY ME DUMB THINGS WHICH WOULD BEAR
WITNESS AGAINST ME IT IS SETTLED ALL THESE THINGS MUST DISAPPEAR
HE FUMBLED IN HIS POCKET DREW OUT HIS PURSE OPENED IT AND TOOK OUT A
SMALL KEY HE INSERTED THE KEY IN A LOCK WHOSE APERTURE COULD HARDLY
BE SEEN SO HIDDEN WAS IT IN THE MOST SOMBRE TONES OF THE DESIGN WHICH
COVERED THE WALL PAPER A SECRET RECEPTACLE OPENED A SORT OF
FALSE CUPBOARD CONSTRUCTED IN THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE
CHIMNEY PIECE IN THIS HIDING PLACE THERE WERE SOME RAGS A BLUE LINEN
BLOUSE AN OLD PAIR OF TROUSERS AN OLD KNAPSACK AND A HUGE THORN
CUDGEL SHOD WITH IRON AT BOTH ENDS
THOSE WHO HAD SEEN JEAN VALJEAN AT
THE EPOCH WHEN HE PASSED THROUGH D IN OCTOBER 1815 COULD EASILY
HAVE RECOGNIZED ALL THE PIECES OF THIS MISERABLE OUTFIT
HE HAD PRESERVED THEM AS HE HAD PRESERVED THE SILVER CANDLESTICKS IN
ORDER TO REMIND HIMSELF CONTINUALLY OF HIS STARTING POINT BUT HE
HAD CONCEALED ALL THAT CAME FROM THE GALLEYS AND HE HAD ALLOWED THE
CANDLESTICKS WHICH CAME FROM THE BISHOP TO BE SEEN
HE CAST A FURTIVE GLANCE TOWARDS THE DOOR AS THOUGH HE FEARED THAT IT
WOULD OPEN IN SPITE OF THE BOLT WHICH FASTENED IT THEN WITH A QUICK
AND ABRUPT MOVEMENT HE TOOK THE WHOLE IN HIS ARMS AT ONCE WITHOUT
BESTOWING SO MUCH AS A GLANCE ON THE THINGS WHICH HE HAD SO RELIGIOUSLY
AND SO PERILOUSLY PRESERVED FOR SO MANY YEARS AND FLUNG THEM ALL RAGS
CUDGEL KNAPSACK INTO THE FIRE
ILLUSTRATION CANDLESTICKS INTO THE FIRE 1B7 3 INTO THE FIRE
HE CLOSED THE FALSE CUPBOARD AGAIN AND WITH REDOUBLED PRECAUTIONS
HENCEFORTH UNNECESSARY SINCE IT WAS NOW EMPTY HE CONCEALED THE DOOR
BEHIND A HEAVY PIECE OF FURNITURE WHICH HE PUSHED IN FRONT OF IT
AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW SECONDS THE ROOM AND THE OPPOSITE WALL WERE
LIGHTED UP WITH A FIERCE RED TREMULOUS GLOW
EVERYTHING WAS ON FIRE
THE THORN CUDGEL SNAPPED AND THREW OUT SPARKS TO THE MIDDLE OF THE
CHAMBER
AS THE KNAPSACK WAS CONSUMED TOGETHER WITH THE HIDEOUS RAGS WHICH IT
CONTAINED IT REVEALED SOMETHING WHICH SPARKLED IN THE ASHES
BY BENDING
OVER ONE COULD HAVE READILY RECOGNIZED A COIN NO DOUBT THE FORTY SOU
PIECE STOLEN FROM THE LITTLE SAVOYARD
HE DID NOT LOOK AT THE FIRE BUT PACED BACK AND FORTH WITH THE SAME
STEP
ALL AT ONCE HIS EYE FELL ON THE TWO SILVER CANDLESTICKS WHICH SHONE
VAGUELY ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE THROUGH THE GLOW
HOLD HE THOUGHT THE WHOLE OF JEAN VALJEAN IS STILL IN THEM
THEY
MUST BE DESTROYED ALSO
HE SEIZED THE TWO CANDLESTICKS
THERE WAS STILL FIRE ENOUGH TO ALLOW OF THEIR BEING PUT OUT OF SHAPE
AND CONVERTED INTO A SORT OF UNRECOGNIZABLE BAR OF METAL
HE BENT OVER THE HEARTH AND WARMED HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT
HE FELT A SENSE
OF REAL COMFORT
HOW GOOD WARMTH IS SAID HE
HE STIRRED THE LIVE COALS WITH ONE OF THE CANDLESTICKS
A MINUTE MORE AND THEY WERE BOTH IN THE FIRE
AT THAT MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HEARD A VOICE WITHIN HIM
SHOUTING JEAN VALJEAN JEAN VALJEAN
HIS HAIR ROSE UPRIGHT HE BECAME LIKE A MAN WHO IS LISTENING TO SOME
TERRIBLE THING
YES THAT'S IT FINISH SAID THE VOICE
COMPLETE WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT
DESTROY THESE CANDLESTICKS ANNIHILATE THIS SOUVENIR FORGET THE BISHOP
FORGET EVERYTHING DESTROY THIS CHAMPMATHIEU DO THAT IS RIGHT APPLAUD
YOURSELF SO IT IS SETTLED RESOLVED FIXED AGREED HERE IS AN OLD MAN
WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IS WANTED OF HIM WHO HAS PERHAPS DONE NOTHING
AN INNOCENT MAN WHOSE WHOLE MISFORTUNE LIES IN YOUR NAME UPON WHOM
YOUR NAME WEIGHS LIKE A CRIME WHO IS ABOUT TO BE TAKEN FOR YOU WHO
WILL BE CONDEMNED WHO WILL FINISH HIS DAYS IN ABJECTNESS AND HORROR
THAT IS GOOD BE AN HONEST MAN YOURSELF REMAIN MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
REMAIN HONORABLE AND HONORED ENRICH THE TOWN NOURISH THE INDIGENT
REAR THE ORPHAN LIVE HAPPY VIRTUOUS AND ADMIRED AND DURING THIS
TIME WHILE YOU ARE HERE IN THE MIDST OF JOY AND LIGHT THERE WILL BE A
MAN WHO WILL WEAR YOUR RED BLOUSE WHO WILL BEAR YOUR NAME IN IGNOMINY
AND WHO WILL DRAG YOUR CHAIN IN THE GALLEYS
YES IT IS WELL ARRANGED
THUS
AH WRETCH
THE PERSPIRATION STREAMED FROM HIS BROW
HE FIXED A HAGGARD EYE ON THE
CANDLESTICKS
BUT THAT WITHIN HIM WHICH HAD SPOKEN HAD NOT FINISHED
THE
VOICE CONTINUED
JEAN VALJEAN THERE WILL BE AROUND YOU MANY VOICES WHICH WILL MAKE A
GREAT NOISE WHICH WILL TALK VERY LOUD AND WHICH WILL BLESS YOU AND
ONLY ONE WHICH NO ONE WILL HEAR AND WHICH WILL CURSE YOU IN THE DARK
WELL LISTEN INFAMOUS MAN ALL THOSE BENEDICTIONS WILL FALL BACK BEFORE
THEY REACH HEAVEN AND ONLY THE MALEDICTION WILL ASCEND TO GOD
THIS VOICE FEEBLE AT FIRST AND WHICH HAD PROCEEDED FROM THE MOST
OBSCURE DEPTHS OF HIS CONSCIENCE HAD GRADUALLY BECOME STARTLING AND
FORMIDABLE AND HE NOW HEARD IT IN HIS VERY EAR
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT
IT HAD DETACHED ITSELF FROM HIM AND THAT IT WAS NOW SPEAKING OUTSIDE
OF HIM
HE THOUGHT THAT HE HEARD THE LAST WORDS SO DISTINCTLY THAT HE
GLANCED AROUND THE ROOM IN A SORT OF TERROR
IS THERE ANY ONE HERE HE DEMANDED ALOUD IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT
THEN HE RESUMED WITH A LAUGH WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF AN IDIOT
HOW STUPID I AM THERE CAN BE NO ONE
THERE WAS SOME ONE BUT THE PERSON WHO WAS THERE WAS OF THOSE WHOM THE
HUMAN EYE CANNOT SEE
HE PLACED THE CANDLESTICKS ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
THEN HE RESUMED HIS MONOTONOUS AND LUGUBRIOUS TRAMP WHICH TROUBLED THE
DREAMS OF THE SLEEPING MAN BENEATH HIM AND AWOKE HIM WITH A START
THIS TRAMPING TO AND FRO SOOTHED AND AT THE SAME TIME INTOXICATED HIM
IT SOMETIMES SEEMS ON SUPREME OCCASIONS AS THOUGH PEOPLE MOVED ABOUT
FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASKING ADVICE OF EVERYTHING THAT THEY MAY ENCOUNTER
BY CHANGE OF PLACE
AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW MINUTES HE NO LONGER KNEW
HIS POSITION
HE NOW RECOILED IN EQUAL TERROR BEFORE BOTH THE RESOLUTIONS AT WHICH HE
HAD ARRIVED IN TURN
THE TWO IDEAS WHICH COUNSELLED HIM APPEARED TO HIM
EQUALLY FATAL
WHAT A FATALITY WHAT CONJUNCTION THAT THAT CHAMPMATHIEU
SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR HIM TO BE OVERWHELMED BY PRECISELY THE MEANS
WHICH PROVIDENCE SEEMED TO HAVE EMPLOYED AT FIRST TO STRENGTHEN HIS
POSITION
THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN HE REFLECTED ON THE FUTURE
DENOUNCE HIMSELF
GREAT GOD DELIVER HIMSELF UP WITH IMMENSE DESPAIR HE FACED ALL THAT
HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO LEAVE ALL THAT HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO TAKE UP
ONCE MORE
HE SHOULD HAVE TO BID FAREWELL TO THAT EXISTENCE WHICH WAS SO
GOOD SO PURE SO RADIANT TO THE RESPECT OF ALL TO HONOR TO LIBERTY
HE SHOULD NEVER MORE STROLL IN THE FIELDS HE SHOULD NEVER MORE HEAR THE
BIRDS SING IN THE MONTH OF MAY HE SHOULD NEVER MORE BESTOW ALMS ON THE
LITTLE CHILDREN HE SHOULD NEVER MORE EXPERIENCE THE SWEETNESS OF HAVING
GLANCES OF GRATITUDE AND LOVE FIXED UPON HIM HE SHOULD QUIT THAT HOUSE
WHICH HE HAD BUILT THAT LITTLE CHAMBER EVERYTHING SEEMED CHARMING TO
HIM AT THAT MOMENT
NEVER AGAIN SHOULD HE READ THOSE BOOKS NEVER MORE
SHOULD HE WRITE ON THAT LITTLE TABLE OF WHITE WOOD HIS OLD PORTRESS
THE ONLY SERVANT WHOM HE KEPT WOULD NEVER MORE BRING HIM HIS COFFEE
IN THE MORNING
GREAT GOD INSTEAD OF THAT THE CONVICT GANG THE IRON
NECKLET THE RED WAISTCOAT THE CHAIN ON HIS ANKLE FATIGUE THE CELL
THE CAMP BED ALL THOSE HORRORS WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL AT HIS AGE
AFTER HAVING BEEN WHAT HE WAS IF HE WERE ONLY YOUNG AGAIN BUT TO
BE ADDRESSED IN HIS OLD AGE AS THOU BY ANY ONE WHO PLEASED TO
BE SEARCHED BY THE CONVICT GUARD TO RECEIVE THE GALLEY SERGEANT'S
CUDGELLINGS TO WEAR IRON BOUND SHOES ON HIS BARE FEET TO HAVE TO
STRETCH OUT HIS LEG NIGHT AND MORNING TO THE HAMMER OF THE ROUNDSMAN WHO
VISITS THE GANG TO SUBMIT TO THE CURIOSITY OF STRANGERS WHO WOULD BE
TOLD THAT MAN YONDER IS THE FAMOUS JEAN VALJEAN WHO WAS MAYOR OF
M
SUR M AND AT NIGHT DRIPPING WITH PERSPIRATION OVERWHELMED WITH
LASSITUDE THEIR GREEN CAPS DRAWN OVER THEIR EYES TO REMOUNT TWO BY
TWO THE LADDER STAIRCASE OF THE GALLEYS BENEATH THE SERGEANT'S WHIP
OH WHAT MISERY CAN DESTINY THEN BE AS MALICIOUS AS AN INTELLIGENT
BEING AND BECOME AS MONSTROUS AS THE HUMAN HEART
AND DO WHAT HE WOULD HE ALWAYS FELL BACK UPON THE HEARTRENDING DILEMMA
WHICH LAY AT THE FOUNDATION OF HIS REVERY SHOULD HE REMAIN IN PARADISE
AND BECOME A DEMON SHOULD HE RETURN TO HELL AND BECOME AN ANGEL
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE GREAT GOD WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
THE TORMENT FROM WHICH HE HAD ESCAPED WITH SO MUCH DIFFICULTY WAS
UNCHAINED AFRESH WITHIN HIM
HIS IDEAS BEGAN TO GROW CONFUSED ONCE
MORE THEY ASSUMED A KIND OF STUPEFIED AND MECHANICAL QUALITY WHICH IS
PECULIAR TO DESPAIR
THE NAME OF ROMAINVILLE RECURRED INCESSANTLY TO HIS
MIND WITH THE TWO VERSES OF A SONG WHICH HE HAD HEARD IN THE PAST
HE THOUGHT THAT ROMAINVILLE WAS A LITTLE GROVE NEAR PARIS WHERE YOUNG
LOVERS GO TO PLUCK LILACS IN THE MONTH OF APRIL
HE WAVERED OUTWARDLY AS WELL AS INWARDLY
HE WALKED LIKE A LITTLE CHILD
WHO IS PERMITTED TO TODDLE ALONE
AT INTERVALS AS HE COMBATED HIS LASSITUDE HE MADE AN EFFORT TO RECOVER
THE MASTERY OF HIS MIND
HE TRIED TO PUT TO HIMSELF FOR THE LAST TIME
AND DEFINITELY THE PROBLEM OVER WHICH HE HAD IN A MANNER FALLEN
PROSTRATE WITH FATIGUE OUGHT HE TO DENOUNCE HIMSELF OUGHT HE TO HOLD
HIS PEACE HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO SEE ANYTHING DISTINCTLY
THE VAGUE
ASPECTS OF ALL THE COURSES OF REASONING WHICH HAD BEEN SKETCHED OUT BY
HIS MEDITATIONS QUIVERED AND VANISHED ONE AFTER THE OTHER INTO SMOKE
HE ONLY FELT THAT TO WHATEVER COURSE OF ACTION HE MADE UP HIS MIND
SOMETHING IN HIM MUST DIE AND THAT OF NECESSITY AND WITHOUT HIS BEING
ABLE TO ESCAPE THE FACT THAT HE WAS ENTERING A SEPULCHRE ON THE
RIGHT HAND AS MUCH AS ON THE LEFT THAT HE WAS PASSING THROUGH A DEATH
AGONY THE AGONY OF HIS HAPPINESS OR THE AGONY OF HIS VIRTUE
ALAS ALL HIS RESOLUTION HAD AGAIN TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIM
HE WAS NO
FURTHER ADVANCED THAN AT THE BEGINNING
THUS DID THIS UNHAPPY SOUL STRUGGLE IN ITS ANGUISH
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED
YEARS BEFORE THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN THE MYSTERIOUS BEING IN WHOM ARE
SUMMED UP ALL THE SANCTITIES AND ALL THE SUFFERINGS OF HUMANITY HAD ALSO
LONG THRUST ASIDE WITH HIS HAND WHILE THE OLIVE TREES QUIVERED IN
THE WILD WIND OF THE INFINITE THE TERRIBLE CUP WHICH APPEARED TO HIM
DRIPPING WITH DARKNESS AND OVERFLOWING WITH SHADOWS IN THE DEPTHS ALL
STUDDED WITH STARS
CHAPTER IV FORMS ASSUMED BY SUFFERING DURING SLEEP
THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING HAD JUST STRUCK AND HE HAD BEEN WALKING
THUS FOR FIVE HOURS ALMOST UNINTERRUPTEDLY WHEN HE AT LENGTH ALLOWED
HIMSELF TO DROP INTO HIS CHAIR
THERE HE FELL ASLEEP AND HAD A DREAM
THIS DREAM LIKE THE MAJORITY OF DREAMS BORE NO RELATION TO THE
SITUATION EXCEPT BY ITS PAINFUL AND HEART RENDING CHARACTER BUT IT
MADE AN IMPRESSION ON HIM
THIS NIGHTMARE STRUCK HIM SO FORCIBLY THAT HE
WROTE IT DOWN LATER ON
IT IS ONE OF THE PAPERS IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING
WHICH HE HAS BEQUEATHED TO US
WE THINK THAT WE HAVE HERE REPRODUCED THE
THING IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH THE TEXT
OF WHATEVER NATURE THIS DREAM MAY BE THE HISTORY OF THIS NIGHT WOULD
BE INCOMPLETE IF WE WERE TO OMIT IT IT IS THE GLOOMY ADVENTURE OF AN
AILING SOUL
HERE IT IS
ON THE ENVELOPE WE FIND THIS LINE INSCRIBED THE DREAM I
HAD THAT NIGHT
I WAS IN A PLAIN A VAST GLOOMY PLAIN WHERE THERE WAS NO GRASS
IT
DID NOT SEEM TO ME TO BE DAYLIGHT NOR YET NIGHT
I WAS WALKING WITH MY BROTHER THE BROTHER OF MY CHILDISH YEARS
THE BROTHER OF WHOM I MUST SAY I NEVER THINK AND WHOM I NOW HARDLY
REMEMBER
WE WERE CONVERSING AND WE MET SOME PASSERS BY
WE WERE TALKING OF A
NEIGHBOR OF OURS IN FORMER DAYS WHO HAD ALWAYS WORKED WITH HER WINDOW
OPEN FROM THE TIME WHEN SHE CAME TO LIVE ON THE STREET
AS WE TALKED WE
FELT COLD BECAUSE OF THAT OPEN WINDOW
THERE WERE NO TREES IN THE PLAIN
WE SAW A MAN PASSING CLOSE TO US
HE
WAS ENTIRELY NUDE OF THE HUE OF ASHES AND MOUNTED ON A HORSE WHICH WAS
EARTH COLOR
THE MAN HAD NO HAIR WE COULD SEE HIS SKULL AND THE VEINS
ON IT
IN HIS HAND HE HELD A SWITCH WHICH WAS AS SUPPLE AS A VINE SHOOT
AND AS HEAVY AS IRON
THIS HORSEMAN PASSED AND SAID NOTHING TO US
MY BROTHER SAID TO ME 'LET US TAKE TO THE HOLLOW ROAD
THERE EXISTED A HOLLOW WAY WHEREIN ONE SAW NEITHER A SINGLE SHRUB NOR
A SPEAR OF MOSS
EVERYTHING WAS DIRT COLORED EVEN THE SKY
AFTER
PROCEEDING A FEW PACES I RECEIVED NO REPLY WHEN I SPOKE I PERCEIVED
THAT MY BROTHER WAS NO LONGER WITH ME
I ENTERED A VILLAGE WHICH I ESPIED
I REFLECTED THAT IT MUST BE
ROMAINVILLE
WHY ROMAINVILLE 5
THE FIRST STREET THAT I ENTERED WAS DESERTED
I ENTERED A SECOND
STREET
BEHIND THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE TWO STREETS A MAN WAS STANDING
ERECT AGAINST THE WALL
I SAID TO THIS MAN
'WHAT COUNTRY IS THIS WHERE AM I THE MAN MADE NO REPLY
I SAW THE
DOOR OF A HOUSE OPEN AND I ENTERED
THE FIRST CHAMBER WAS DESERTED
I ENTERED THE SECOND
BEHIND THE DOOR
OF THIS CHAMBER A MAN WAS STANDING ERECT AGAINST THE WALL
I INQUIRED OF
THIS MAN 'WHOSE HOUSE IS THIS WHERE AM I THE MAN REPLIED NOT
THE HOUSE HAD A GARDEN
I QUITTED THE HOUSE AND ENTERED THE GARDEN
THE GARDEN WAS DESERTED
BEHIND THE FIRST TREE I FOUND A MAN STANDING
UPRIGHT
I SAID TO THIS MAN 'WHAT GARDEN IS THIS WHERE AM I THE MAN
DID NOT ANSWER
I STROLLED INTO THE VILLAGE AND PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS A TOWN
ALL
THE STREETS WERE DESERTED ALL THE DOORS WERE OPEN
NOT A SINGLE LIVING
BEING WAS PASSING IN THE STREETS WALKING THROUGH THE CHAMBERS OR
STROLLING IN THE GARDENS
BUT BEHIND EACH ANGLE OF THE WALLS BEHIND
EACH DOOR BEHIND EACH TREE STOOD A SILENT MAN
ONLY ONE WAS TO BE SEEN
AT A TIME
THESE MEN WATCHED ME PASS
I LEFT THE TOWN AND BEGAN TO RAMBLE ABOUT THE FIELDS
AFTER THE LAPSE OF SOME TIME I TURNED BACK AND SAW A GREAT CROWD COMING
UP BEHIND ME
I RECOGNIZED ALL THE MEN WHOM I HAD SEEN IN THAT TOWN
THEY HAD STRANGE HEADS
THEY DID NOT SEEM TO BE IN A HURRY YET THEY
WALKED FASTER THAN I DID
THEY MADE NO NOISE AS THEY WALKED
IN AN
INSTANT THIS CROWD HAD OVERTAKEN AND SURROUNDED ME
THE FACES OF THESE
MEN WERE EARTHEN IN HUE
THEN THE FIRST ONE WHOM I HAD SEEN AND QUESTIONED ON ENTERING THE TOWN
SAID TO ME
'WHITHER ARE YOU GOING DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DEAD THIS
LONG TIME
I OPENED MY MOUTH TO REPLY AND I PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS NO ONE NEAR
ME
HE WOKE
HE WAS ICY COLD
A WIND WHICH WAS CHILL LIKE THE BREEZE OF DAWN
WAS RATTLING THE LEAVES OF THE WINDOW WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN ON THEIR
HINGES
THE FIRE WAS OUT
THE CANDLE WAS NEARING ITS END
IT WAS STILL
BLACK NIGHT
HE ROSE HE WENT TO THE WINDOW
THERE WERE NO STARS IN THE SKY EVEN YET
FROM HIS WINDOW THE YARD OF THE HOUSE AND THE STREET WERE VISIBLE
A
SHARP HARSH NOISE WHICH MADE HIM DROP HIS EYES RESOUNDED FROM THE
EARTH
BELOW HIM HE PERCEIVED TWO RED STARS WHOSE RAYS LENGTHENED AND
SHORTENED IN A SINGULAR MANNER THROUGH THE DARKNESS
AS HIS THOUGHTS WERE STILL HALF IMMERSED IN THE MISTS OF SLEEP HOLD
SAID HE THERE ARE NO STARS IN THE SKY
THEY ARE ON EARTH NOW
BUT THIS CONFUSION VANISHED A SECOND SOUND SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ROUSED
HIM THOROUGHLY HE LOOKED AND RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT THESE TWO STARS
WERE THE LANTERNS OF A CARRIAGE
BY THE LIGHT WHICH THEY CAST HE WAS
ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE FORM OF THIS VEHICLE
IT WAS A TILBURY HARNESSED
TO A SMALL WHITE HORSE
THE NOISE WHICH HE HAD HEARD WAS THE TRAMPLING
OF THE HORSE'S HOOFS ON THE PAVEMENT
WHAT VEHICLE IS THIS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
WHO IS COMING HERE SO EARLY
IN THE MORNING
AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME A LIGHT TAP ON THE DOOR OF HIS CHAMBER
HE SHUDDERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND CRIED IN A TERRIBLE VOICE
WHO IS THERE
SOME ONE SAID
I MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
HE RECOGNIZED THE VOICE OF THE OLD WOMAN WHO WAS HIS PORTRESS
WELL HE REPLIED WHAT IS IT
MONSIEUR LE MAIRE IT IS JUST FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
WHAT IS THAT TO ME
THE CABRIOLET IS HERE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
WHAT CABRIOLET
THE TILBURY
WHAT TILBURY
DID NOT MONSIEUR LE MAIRE ORDER A TILBURY
NO SAID HE
THE COACHMAN SAYS THAT HE HAS COME FOR MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
WHAT COACHMAN
M
SCAUFFLAIRE'S COACHMAN
M
SCAUFFLAIRE
THAT NAME SENT A SHUDDER OVER HIM AS THOUGH A FLASH OF LIGHTNING HAD
PASSED IN FRONT OF HIS FACE
AH YES HE RESUMED M
SCAUFFLAIRE
IF THE OLD WOMAN COULD HAVE SEEN HIM AT THAT MOMENT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN
FRIGHTENED
A TOLERABLY LONG SILENCE ENSUED
HE EXAMINED THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE
WITH A STUPID AIR AND FROM AROUND THE WICK HE TOOK SOME OF THE BURNING
WAX WHICH HE ROLLED BETWEEN HIS FINGERS
THE OLD WOMAN WAITED FOR HIM
SHE EVEN VENTURED TO UPLIFT HER VOICE ONCE MORE
WHAT AM I TO SAY MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
SAY THAT IT IS WELL AND THAT I AM COMING DOWN
CHAPTER V HINDRANCES
THE POSTING SERVICE FROM ARRAS TO M
SUR M
WAS STILL OPERATED AT THIS
PERIOD BY SMALL MAIL WAGONS OF THE TIME OF THE EMPIRE
THESE MAIL WAGONS
WERE TWO WHEELED CABRIOLETS UPHOLSTERED INSIDE WITH FAWN COLORED
LEATHER HUNG ON SPRINGS AND HAVING BUT TWO SEATS ONE FOR THE POSTBOY
THE OTHER FOR THE TRAVELLER
THE WHEELS WERE ARMED WITH THOSE LONG
OFFENSIVE AXLES WHICH KEEP OTHER VEHICLES AT A DISTANCE AND WHICH
MAY STILL BE SEEN ON THE ROAD IN GERMANY
THE DESPATCH BOX AN IMMENSE
OBLONG COFFER WAS PLACED BEHIND THE VEHICLE AND FORMED A PART OF IT
THIS COFFER WAS PAINTED BLACK AND THE CABRIOLET YELLOW
THESE VEHICLES WHICH HAVE NO COUNTERPARTS NOWADAYS HAD SOMETHING
DISTORTED AND HUNCHBACKED ABOUT THEM AND WHEN ONE SAW THEM PASSING IN
THE DISTANCE AND CLIMBING UP SOME ROAD TO THE HORIZON THEY RESEMBLED
THE INSECTS WHICH ARE CALLED I THINK TERMITES AND WHICH THOUGH WITH
BUT LITTLE CORSELET DRAG A GREAT TRAIN BEHIND THEM
BUT THEY TRAVELLED
AT A VERY RAPID RATE
THE POST WAGON WHICH SET OUT FROM ARRAS AT ONE
O'CLOCK EVERY NIGHT AFTER THE MAIL FROM PARIS HAD PASSED ARRIVED AT M
SUR M
A LITTLE BEFORE FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THAT NIGHT THE WAGON WHICH WAS DESCENDING TO M
SUR M
BY THE HESDIN
ROAD COLLIDED AT THE CORNER OF A STREET JUST AS IT WAS ENTERING THE
TOWN WITH A LITTLE TILBURY HARNESSED TO A WHITE HORSE WHICH WAS GOING
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND IN WHICH THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON A MAN
ENVELOPED IN A MANTLE
THE WHEEL OF THE TILBURY RECEIVED QUITE A VIOLENT
SHOCK
THE POSTMAN SHOUTED TO THE MAN TO STOP BUT THE TRAVELLER PAID NO
HEED AND PURSUED HIS ROAD AT FULL GALLOP
THAT MAN IS IN A DEVILISH HURRY SAID THE POSTMAN
THE MAN THUS HASTENING ON WAS THE ONE WHOM WE HAVE JUST SEEN STRUGGLING
IN CONVULSIONS WHICH ARE CERTAINLY DESERVING OF PITY
WHITHER WAS HE GOING HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD
WHY WAS HE HASTENING
HE DID NOT KNOW
HE WAS DRIVING AT RANDOM STRAIGHT AHEAD
WHITHER
TO ARRAS NO DOUBT BUT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GOING ELSEWHERE AS WELL
AT TIMES HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF IT AND HE SHUDDERED
HE PLUNGED INTO THE
NIGHT AS INTO A GULF
SOMETHING URGED HIM FORWARD SOMETHING DREW HIM
ON
NO ONE COULD HAVE TOLD WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE WITHIN HIM EVERY ONE
WILL UNDERSTAND IT
WHAT MAN IS THERE WHO HAS NOT ENTERED AT LEAST ONCE
IN HIS LIFE INTO THAT OBSCURE CAVERN OF THE UNKNOWN
HOWEVER HE HAD RESOLVED ON NOTHING DECIDED NOTHING FORMED NO PLAN
DONE NOTHING
NONE OF THE ACTIONS OF HIS CONSCIENCE HAD BEEN DECISIVE
HE WAS MORE THAN EVER AS HE HAD BEEN AT THE FIRST MOMENT
WHY WAS HE GOING TO ARRAS
HE REPEATED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY SAID TO HIMSELF WHEN HE HAD HIRED
SCAUFFLAIRE'S CABRIOLET THAT WHATEVER THE RESULT WAS TO BE THERE WAS
NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES AND JUDGE OF MATTERS
FOR HIMSELF THAT THIS WAS EVEN PRUDENT THAT HE MUST KNOW WHAT TOOK
PLACE THAT NO DECISION COULD BE ARRIVED AT WITHOUT HAVING OBSERVED AND
SCRUTINIZED THAT ONE MADE MOUNTAINS OUT OF EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE
THAT AT ANY RATE WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT CHAMPMATHIEU SOME
WRETCH HIS CONSCIENCE WOULD PROBABLY BE GREATLY RELIEVED TO ALLOW HIM
TO GO TO THE GALLEYS IN HIS STEAD THAT JAVERT WOULD INDEED BE THERE
AND THAT BREVET THAT CHENILDIEU THAT COCHEPAILLE OLD CONVICTS WHO
HAD KNOWN HIM BUT THEY CERTAINLY WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE HIM BAH WHAT AN
IDEA THAT JAVERT WAS A HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM SUSPECTING THE TRUTH THAT
ALL CONJECTURES AND ALL SUPPOSITIONS WERE FIXED ON CHAMPMATHIEU AND
THAT THERE IS NOTHING SO HEADSTRONG AS SUPPOSITIONS AND CONJECTURES
THAT ACCORDINGLY THERE WAS NO DANGER
THAT IT WAS NO DOUBT A DARK MOMENT BUT THAT HE SHOULD EMERGE FROM IT
THAT AFTER ALL HE HELD HIS DESTINY HOWEVER BAD IT MIGHT BE IN HIS
OWN HAND THAT HE WAS MASTER OF IT
HE CLUNG TO THIS THOUGHT
AT BOTTOM TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED NOT TO GO TO
ARRAS
NEVERTHELESS HE WAS GOING THITHER
AS HE MEDITATED HE WHIPPED UP HIS HORSE WHICH WAS PROCEEDING AT THAT
FINE REGULAR AND EVEN TROT WHICH ACCOMPLISHES TWO LEAGUES AND A HALF
AN HOUR
IN PROPORTION AS THE CABRIOLET ADVANCED HE FELT SOMETHING WITHIN HIM
DRAW BACK
AT DAYBREAK HE WAS IN THE OPEN COUNTRY THE TOWN OF M
SUR M
LAY FAR
BEHIND HIM
HE WATCHED THE HORIZON GROW WHITE HE STARED AT ALL THE
CHILLY FIGURES OF A WINTER'S DAWN AS THEY PASSED BEFORE HIS EYES
BUT WITHOUT SEEING THEM
THE MORNING HAS ITS SPECTRES AS WELL AS THE
EVENING
HE DID NOT SEE THEM BUT WITHOUT HIS BEING AWARE OF IT AND BY
MEANS OF A SORT OF PENETRATION WHICH WAS ALMOST PHYSICAL THESE BLACK
SILHOUETTES OF TREES AND OF HILLS ADDED SOME GLOOMY AND SINISTER QUALITY
TO THE VIOLENT STATE OF HIS SOUL
EACH TIME THAT HE PASSED ONE OF THOSE ISOLATED DWELLINGS WHICH SOMETIMES
BORDER ON THE HIGHWAY HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND YET THERE ARE PEOPLE
THERE WITHIN WHO ARE SLEEPING
THE TROT OF THE HORSE THE BELLS ON THE HARNESS THE WHEELS ON THE ROAD
PRODUCED A GENTLE MONOTONOUS NOISE
THESE THINGS ARE CHARMING WHEN ONE
IS JOYOUS AND LUGUBRIOUS WHEN ONE IS SAD
IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT WHEN HE ARRIVED AT HESDIN
HE HALTED IN FRONT OF
THE INN TO ALLOW THE HORSE A BREATHING SPELL AND TO HAVE HIM GIVEN
SOME OATS
THE HORSE BELONGED AS SCAUFFLAIRE HAD SAID TO THAT SMALL RACE OF THE
BOULONNAIS WHICH HAS TOO MUCH HEAD TOO MUCH BELLY AND NOT ENOUGH NECK
AND SHOULDERS BUT WHICH HAS A BROAD CHEST A LARGE CRUPPER THIN FINE
LEGS AND SOLID HOOFS A HOMELY BUT A ROBUST AND HEALTHY RACE
THE
EXCELLENT BEAST HAD TRAVELLED FIVE LEAGUES IN TWO HOURS AND HAD NOT A
DROP OF SWEAT ON HIS LOINS
HE DID NOT GET OUT OF THE TILBURY
THE STABLEMAN WHO BROUGHT THE OATS
SUDDENLY BENT DOWN AND EXAMINED THE LEFT WHEEL
ARE YOU GOING FAR IN THIS CONDITION SAID THE MAN
HE REPLIED WITH AN AIR OF NOT HAVING ROUSED HIMSELF FROM HIS REVERY
WHY
HAVE YOU COME FROM A GREAT DISTANCE WENT ON THE MAN
FIVE LEAGUES
AH
WHY DO YOU SAY 'AH
THE MAN BENT DOWN ONCE MORE WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT WITH HIS EYES
FIXED ON THE WHEEL THEN HE ROSE ERECT AND SAID
BECAUSE THOUGH THIS WHEEL HAS TRAVELLED FIVE LEAGUES IT CERTAINLY
WILL NOT TRAVEL ANOTHER QUARTER OF A LEAGUE
HE SPRANG OUT OF THE TILBURY
WHAT IS THAT YOU SAY MY FRIEND
I SAY THAT IT IS A MIRACLE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE TRAVELLED FIVE LEAGUES
WITHOUT YOU AND YOUR HORSE ROLLING INTO SOME DITCH ON THE HIGHWAY
JUST
SEE HERE
THE WHEEL REALLY HAD SUFFERED SERIOUS DAMAGE
THE SHOCK ADMINISTERED BY
THE MAIL WAGON HAD SPLIT TWO SPOKES AND STRAINED THE HUB SO THAT THE
NUT NO LONGER HELD FIRM
MY FRIEND HE SAID TO THE STABLEMAN IS THERE A WHEELWRIGHT HERE
CERTAINLY SIR
DO ME THE SERVICE TO GO AND FETCH HIM
HE IS ONLY A STEP FROM HERE
HEY MASTER BOURGAILLARD
MASTER BOURGAILLARD THE WHEELWRIGHT WAS STANDING ON HIS OWN THRESHOLD
HE CAME EXAMINED THE WHEEL AND MADE A GRIMACE LIKE A SURGEON WHEN THE
LATTER THINKS A LIMB IS BROKEN
CAN YOU REPAIR THIS WHEEL IMMEDIATELY
YES SIR
WHEN CAN I SET OUT AGAIN
TO MORROW
TO MORROW
THERE IS A LONG DAY'S WORK ON IT
ARE YOU IN A HURRY SIR
IN A VERY GREAT HURRY
I MUST SET OUT AGAIN IN AN HOUR AT THE LATEST
IMPOSSIBLE SIR
I WILL PAY WHATEVER YOU ASK
IMPOSSIBLE
WELL IN TWO HOURS THEN
IMPOSSIBLE TO DAY
TWO NEW SPOKES AND A HUB MUST BE MADE
MONSIEUR WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO START BEFORE TO MORROW MORNING
THE MATTER CANNOT WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW
WHAT IF YOU WERE TO REPLACE
THIS WHEEL INSTEAD OF REPAIRING IT
HOW SO
YOU ARE A WHEELWRIGHT
CERTAINLY SIR
HAVE YOU NOT A WHEEL THAT YOU CAN SELL ME THEN I COULD START AGAIN AT
ONCE
A SPARE WHEEL
YES
I HAVE NO WHEEL ON HAND THAT WOULD FIT YOUR CABRIOLET
TWO WHEELS MAKE
A PAIR
TWO WHEELS CANNOT BE PUT TOGETHER HAP HAZARD
IN THAT CASE SELL ME A PAIR OF WHEELS
NOT ALL WHEELS FIT ALL AXLES SIR
TRY NEVERTHELESS
IT IS USELESS SIR
I HAVE NOTHING TO SELL BUT CART WHEELS
WE ARE BUT
A POOR COUNTRY HERE
HAVE YOU A CABRIOLET THAT YOU CAN LET ME HAVE
THE WHEELWRIGHT HAD SEEN AT THE FIRST GLANCE THAT THE TILBURY WAS A
HIRED VEHICLE
HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
YOU TREAT THE CABRIOLETS THAT PEOPLE LET YOU SO WELL IF I HAD ONE I
WOULD NOT LET IT TO YOU
WELL SELL IT TO ME THEN
I HAVE NONE
WHAT NOT EVEN A SPRING CART I AM NOT HARD TO PLEASE AS YOU SEE
WE LIVE IN A POOR COUNTRY
THERE IS IN TRUTH ADDED THE WHEELWRIGHT
AN OLD CALASH UNDER THE SHED YONDER WHICH BELONGS TO A BOURGEOIS OF
THE TOWN WHO GAVE IT TO ME TO TAKE CARE OF AND WHO ONLY USES IT ON THE
THIRTY SIXTH OF THE MONTH NEVER THAT IS TO SAY
I MIGHT LET THAT
TO YOU FOR WHAT MATTERS IT TO ME BUT THE BOURGEOIS MUST NOT SEE IT
PASS AND THEN IT IS A CALASH IT WOULD REQUIRE TWO HORSES
I WILL TAKE TWO POST HORSES
WHERE IS MONSIEUR GOING
TO ARRAS
AND MONSIEUR WISHES TO REACH THERE TO DAY
YES OF COURSE
BY TAKING TWO POST HORSES
WHY NOT
DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER MONSIEUR ARRIVES AT FOUR O'CLOCK
TO MORROW MORNING
CERTAINLY NOT
THERE IS ONE THING TO BE SAID ABOUT THAT YOU SEE BY TAKING
POST HORSES MONSIEUR HAS HIS PASSPORT
YES
WELL BY TAKING POST HORSES MONSIEUR CANNOT REACH ARRAS BEFORE
TO MORROW
WE ARE ON A CROSS ROAD
THE RELAYS ARE BADLY SERVED THE
HORSES ARE IN THE FIELDS
THE SEASON FOR PLOUGHING IS JUST BEGINNING
HEAVY TEAMS ARE REQUIRED AND HORSES ARE SEIZED UPON EVERYWHERE FROM
THE POST AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE
MONSIEUR WILL HAVE TO WAIT THREE OR FOUR
HOURS AT THE LEAST AT EVERY RELAY
AND THEN THEY DRIVE AT A WALK
THERE ARE MANY HILLS TO ASCEND
COME THEN I WILL GO ON HORSEBACK
UNHARNESS THE CABRIOLET
SOME ONE
CAN SURELY SELL ME A SADDLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WITHOUT DOUBT
BUT WILL THIS HORSE BEAR THE SADDLE
THAT IS TRUE YOU REMIND ME OF THAT HE WILL NOT BEAR IT
THEN
BUT I CAN SURELY HIRE A HORSE IN THE VILLAGE
A HORSE TO TRAVEL TO ARRAS AT ONE STRETCH
YES
THAT WOULD REQUIRE SUCH A HORSE AS DOES NOT EXIST IN THESE PARTS
YOU
WOULD HAVE TO BUY IT TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS YOU
BUT YOU
WILL NOT FIND ONE FOR SALE NOR TO LET FOR FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS OR FOR A
THOUSAND
WHAT AM I TO DO
THE BEST THING IS TO LET ME REPAIR THE WHEEL LIKE AN HONEST MAN AND
SET OUT ON YOUR JOURNEY TO MORROW
TO MORROW WILL BE TOO LATE
THE DEUCE
IS THERE NOT A MAIL WAGON WHICH RUNS TO ARRAS WHEN WILL IT PASS
TO NIGHT
BOTH THE POSTS PASS AT NIGHT THE ONE GOING AS WELL AS THE
ONE COMING
WHAT IT WILL TAKE YOU A DAY TO MEND THIS WHEEL
A DAY AND A GOOD LONG ONE
IF YOU SET TWO MEN TO WORK
IF I SET TEN MEN TO WORK
WHAT IF THE SPOKES WERE TO BE TIED TOGETHER WITH ROPES
THAT COULD BE DONE WITH THE SPOKES NOT WITH THE HUB AND THE FELLY IS
IN A BAD STATE TOO
IS THERE ANY ONE IN THIS VILLAGE WHO LETS OUT TEAMS
NO
IS THERE ANOTHER WHEELWRIGHT
THE STABLEMAN AND THE WHEELWRIGHT REPLIED IN CONCERT WITH A TOSS OF THE
HEAD
NO
HE FELT AN IMMENSE JOY
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT PROVIDENCE WAS INTERVENING
THAT IT WAS IT WHO HAD
BROKEN THE WHEEL OF THE TILBURY AND WHO WAS STOPPING HIM ON THE ROAD
HE HAD NOT YIELDED TO THIS SORT OF FIRST SUMMONS HE HAD JUST MADE EVERY
POSSIBLE EFFORT TO CONTINUE THE JOURNEY HE HAD LOYALLY AND SCRUPULOUSLY
EXHAUSTED ALL MEANS HE HAD BEEN DETERRED NEITHER BY THE SEASON NOR
FATIGUE NOR BY THE EXPENSE HE HAD NOTHING WITH WHICH TO REPROACH
HIMSELF
IF HE WENT NO FURTHER THAT WAS NO FAULT OF HIS
IT DID NOT
CONCERN HIM FURTHER
IT WAS NO LONGER HIS FAULT
IT WAS NOT THE ACT OF
HIS OWN CONSCIENCE BUT THE ACT OF PROVIDENCE
HE BREATHED AGAIN
HE BREATHED FREELY AND TO THE FULL EXTENT OF HIS
LUNGS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE JAVERT'S VISIT
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE
HAND OF IRON WHICH HAD HELD HIS HEART IN ITS GRASP FOR THE LAST TWENTY
HOURS HAD JUST RELEASED HIM
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT GOD WAS FOR HIM NOW AND WAS MANIFESTING HIMSELF
HE SAID HIMSELF THAT HE HAD DONE ALL HE COULD AND THAT NOW HE HAD
NOTHING TO DO BUT RETRACE HIS STEPS QUIETLY
IF HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE WHEELWRIGHT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A CHAMBER
OF THE INN IT WOULD HAVE HAD NO WITNESSES NO ONE WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM
THINGS WOULD HAVE RESTED THERE AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE SHOULD NOT
HAVE HAD TO RELATE ANY OF THE OCCURRENCES WHICH THE READER IS ABOUT
TO PERUSE BUT THIS CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE STREET
ANY
COLLOQUY IN THE STREET INEVITABLY ATTRACTS A CROWD
THERE ARE ALWAYS
PEOPLE WHO ASK NOTHING BETTER THAN TO BECOME SPECTATORS
WHILE HE WAS
QUESTIONING THE WHEELWRIGHT SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE PASSING BACK AND FORTH
HALTED AROUND THEM
AFTER LISTENING FOR A FEW MINUTES A YOUNG LAD TO
WHOM NO ONE HAD PAID ANY HEED DETACHED HIMSELF FROM THE GROUP AND RAN
OFF
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TRAVELLER AFTER THE INWARD DELIBERATION WHICH WE
HAVE JUST DESCRIBED RESOLVED TO RETRACE HIS STEPS THIS CHILD RETURNED
HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AN OLD WOMAN
MONSIEUR SAID THE WOMAN MY BOY TELLS ME THAT YOU WISH TO HIRE A
CABRIOLET
THESE SIMPLE WORDS UTTERED BY AN OLD WOMAN LED BY A CHILD MADE THE
PERSPIRATION TRICKLE DOWN HIS LIMBS
HE THOUGHT THAT HE BEHELD THE HAND
WHICH HAD RELAXED ITS GRASP REAPPEAR IN THE DARKNESS BEHIND HIM READY
TO SEIZE HIM ONCE MORE
HE ANSWERED
YES MY GOOD WOMAN I AM IN SEARCH OF A CABRIOLET WHICH I CAN HIRE
AND HE HASTENED TO ADD
BUT THERE IS NONE IN THE PLACE
CERTAINLY THERE IS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
WHERE INTERPOLATED THE WHEELWRIGHT
AT MY HOUSE REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN
HE SHUDDERED
THE FATAL HAND HAD GRASPED HIM AGAIN
THE OLD WOMAN REALLY HAD IN HER SHED A SORT OF BASKET SPRING CART
THE WHEELWRIGHT AND THE STABLE MAN IN DESPAIR AT THE PROSPECT OF THE
TRAVELLER ESCAPING THEIR CLUTCHES INTERFERED
IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL OLD TRAP IT RESTS FLAT ON THE AXLE IT IS AN ACTUAL
FACT THAT THE SEATS WERE SUSPENDED INSIDE IT BY LEATHER THONGS THE RAIN
CAME INTO IT THE WHEELS WERE RUSTED AND EATEN WITH MOISTURE IT
WOULD NOT GO MUCH FURTHER THAN THE TILBURY A REGULAR RAMSHACKLE OLD
STAGE WAGON THE GENTLEMAN WOULD MAKE A GREAT MISTAKE IF HE TRUSTED
HIMSELF TO IT ETC ETC
ALL THIS WAS TRUE BUT THIS TRAP THIS RAMSHACKLE OLD VEHICLE THIS
THING WHATEVER IT WAS RAN ON ITS TWO WHEELS AND COULD GO TO ARRAS
HE PAID WHAT WAS ASKED LEFT THE TILBURY WITH THE WHEELWRIGHT TO BE
REPAIRED INTENDING TO RECLAIM IT ON HIS RETURN HAD THE WHITE HORSE
PUT TO THE CART CLIMBED INTO IT AND RESUMED THE ROAD WHICH HE HAD BEEN
TRAVELLING SINCE MORNING
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE CART MOVED OFF HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD FELT A
MOMENT PREVIOUSLY A CERTAIN JOY IN THE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD NOT
GO WHITHER HE WAS NOW PROCEEDING
HE EXAMINED THIS JOY WITH A SORT OF
WRATH AND FOUND IT ABSURD
WHY SHOULD HE FEEL JOY AT TURNING BACK
AFTER ALL HE WAS TAKING THIS TRIP OF HIS OWN FREE WILL
NO ONE WAS
FORCING HIM TO IT
AND ASSUREDLY NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN EXCEPT WHAT HE SHOULD CHOOSE
AS HE LEFT HESDIN HE HEARD A VOICE SHOUTING TO HIM STOP STOP HE
HALTED THE CART WITH A VIGOROUS MOVEMENT WHICH CONTAINED A FEVERISH AND
CONVULSIVE ELEMENT RESEMBLING HOPE
IT WAS THE OLD WOMAN'S LITTLE BOY
MONSIEUR SAID THE LATTER IT WAS I WHO GOT THE CART FOR YOU
WELL
YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN ME ANYTHING
HE WHO GAVE TO ALL SO READILY THOUGHT THIS DEMAND EXORBITANT AND ALMOST
ODIOUS
AH IT'S YOU YOU SCAMP SAID HE YOU SHALL HAVE NOTHING
HE WHIPPED UP HIS HORSE AND SET OFF AT FULL SPEED
HE HAD LOST A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AT HESDIN
HE WANTED TO MAKE IT GOOD
THE LITTLE HORSE WAS COURAGEOUS AND PULLED FOR TWO BUT IT WAS THE
MONTH OF FEBRUARY THERE HAD BEEN RAIN THE ROADS WERE BAD
AND THEN
IT WAS NO LONGER THE TILBURY
THE CART WAS VERY HEAVY AND IN ADDITION
THERE WERE MANY ASCENTS
HE TOOK NEARLY FOUR HOURS TO GO FROM HESDIN TO SAINT POL FOUR HOURS FOR
FIVE LEAGUES
AT SAINT POL HE HAD THE HORSE UNHARNESSED AT THE FIRST INN HE CAME TO
AND LED TO THE STABLE AS HE HAD PROMISED SCAUFFLAIRE HE STOOD BESIDE
THE MANGER WHILE THE HORSE WAS EATING HE THOUGHT OF SAD AND CONFUSING
THINGS
THE INN KEEPER'S WIFE CAME TO THE STABLE
DOES NOT MONSIEUR WISH TO BREAKFAST
COME THAT IS TRUE I EVEN HAVE A GOOD APPETITE
HE FOLLOWED THE WOMAN WHO HAD A ROSY CHEERFUL FACE SHE LED HIM TO THE
PUBLIC ROOM WHERE THERE WERE TABLES COVERED WITH WAXED CLOTH
MAKE HASTE SAID HE I MUST START AGAIN I AM IN A HURRY
A BIG FLEMISH SERVANT MAID PLACED HIS KNIFE AND FORK IN ALL HASTE HE
LOOKED AT THE GIRL WITH A SENSATION OF COMFORT
THAT IS WHAT AILED ME HE THOUGHT I HAD NOT BREAKFASTED
HIS BREAKFAST WAS SERVED HE SEIZED THE BREAD TOOK A MOUTHFUL AND THEN
SLOWLY REPLACED IT ON THE TABLE AND DID NOT TOUCH IT AGAIN
A CARTER WAS EATING AT ANOTHER TABLE HE SAID TO THIS MAN
WHY IS THEIR BREAD SO BITTER HERE
THE CARTER WAS A GERMAN AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
HE RETURNED TO THE STABLE AND REMAINED NEAR THE HORSE
AN HOUR LATER HE HAD QUITTED SAINT POL AND WAS DIRECTING HIS COURSE
TOWARDS TINQUES WHICH IS ONLY FIVE LEAGUES FROM ARRAS
WHAT DID HE DO DURING THIS JOURNEY OF WHAT WAS HE THINKING AS IN THE
MORNING HE WATCHED THE TREES THE THATCHED ROOFS THE TILLED FIELDS
PASS BY AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE LANDSCAPE BROKEN AT EVERY TURN OF THE
ROAD VANISHED THIS IS A SORT OF CONTEMPLATION WHICH SOMETIMES
SUFFICES TO THE SOUL AND ALMOST RELIEVES IT FROM THOUGHT
WHAT IS MORE
MELANCHOLY AND MORE PROFOUND THAN TO SEE A THOUSAND OBJECTS FOR THE
FIRST AND THE LAST TIME TO TRAVEL IS TO BE BORN AND TO DIE AT EVERY
INSTANT PERHAPS IN THE VAGUEST REGION OF HIS MIND HE DID MAKE
COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE SHIFTING HORIZON AND OUR HUMAN EXISTENCE ALL
THE THINGS OF LIFE ARE PERPETUALLY FLEEING BEFORE US THE DARK AND
BRIGHT INTERVALS ARE INTERMINGLED AFTER A DAZZLING MOMENT AN ECLIPSE
WE LOOK WE HASTEN WE STRETCH OUT OUR HANDS TO GRASP WHAT IS PASSING
EACH EVENT IS A TURN IN THE ROAD AND ALL AT ONCE WE ARE OLD WE FEEL
A SHOCK ALL IS BLACK WE DISTINGUISH AN OBSCURE DOOR THE GLOOMY
HORSE OF LIFE WHICH HAS BEEN DRAWING US HALTS AND WE SEE A VEILED AND
UNKNOWN PERSON UNHARNESSING AMID THE SHADOWS
TWILIGHT WAS FALLING WHEN THE CHILDREN WHO WERE COMING OUT OF SCHOOL
BEHELD THIS TRAVELLER ENTER TINQUES IT IS TRUE THAT THE DAYS WERE STILL
SHORT HE DID NOT HALT AT TINQUES AS HE EMERGED FROM THE VILLAGE A
LABORER WHO WAS MENDING THE ROAD WITH STONES RAISED HIS HEAD AND SAID
TO HIM
THAT HORSE IS VERY MUCH FATIGUED
THE POOR BEAST WAS IN FACT GOING AT A WALK
ARE YOU GOING TO ARRAS ADDED THE ROAD MENDER
YES
IF YOU GO ON AT THAT RATE YOU WILL NOT ARRIVE VERY EARLY
HE STOPPED HIS HORSE AND ASKED THE LABORER
HOW FAR IS IT FROM HERE TO ARRAS
NEARLY SEVEN GOOD LEAGUES
HOW IS THAT THE POSTING GUIDE ONLY SAYS FIVE LEAGUES AND A QUARTER
AH RETURNED THE ROAD MENDER SO YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THE ROAD IS
UNDER REPAIR YOU WILL FIND IT BARRED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FURTHER ON
THERE IS NO WAY TO PROCEED FURTHER
REALLY
YOU WILL TAKE THE ROAD ON THE LEFT LEADING TO CARENCY YOU WILL CROSS
THE RIVER WHEN YOU REACH CAMBLIN YOU WILL TURN TO THE RIGHT THAT IS
THE ROAD TO MONT SAINT ELOY WHICH LEADS TO ARRAS
BUT IT IS NIGHT AND I SHALL LOSE MY WAY
YOU DO NOT BELONG IN THESE PARTS
NO
AND BESIDES IT IS ALL CROSS ROADS STOP SIR RESUMED THE
ROAD MENDER SHALL I GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE YOUR HORSE IS TIRED
RETURN TO TINQUES THERE IS A GOOD INN THERE SLEEP THERE YOU CAN REACH
ARRAS TO MORROW
I MUST BE THERE THIS EVENING
THAT IS DIFFERENT BUT GO TO THE INN ALL THE SAME AND GET AN EXTRA
HORSE THE STABLE BOY WILL GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE CROSS ROADS
HE FOLLOWED THE ROAD MENDER'S ADVICE RETRACED HIS STEPS AND HALF AN
HOUR LATER HE PASSED THE SAME SPOT AGAIN BUT THIS TIME AT FULL SPEED
WITH A GOOD HORSE TO AID A STABLE BOY WHO CALLED HIMSELF A POSTILION
WAS SEATED ON THE SHAFT OF THE CARIOLE
STILL HE FELT THAT HE HAD LOST TIME
NIGHT HAD FULLY COME
THEY TURNED INTO THE CROSS ROAD THE WAY BECAME FRIGHTFULLY BAD THE
CART LURCHED FROM ONE RUT TO THE OTHER HE SAID TO THE POSTILION
KEEP AT A TROT AND YOU SHALL HAVE A DOUBLE FEE
IN ONE OF THE JOLTS THE WHIFFLE TREE BROKE
THERE'S THE WHIFFLE TREE BROKEN SIR SAID THE POSTILION I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO HARNESS MY HORSE NOW THIS ROAD IS VERY BAD AT NIGHT IF
YOU WISH TO RETURN AND SLEEP AT TINQUES WE COULD BE IN ARRAS EARLY
TO MORROW MORNING
HE REPLIED HAVE YOU A BIT OF ROPE AND A KNIFE
YES SIR
HE CUT A BRANCH FROM A TREE AND MADE A WHIFFLE TREE OF IT
THIS CAUSED ANOTHER LOSS OF TWENTY MINUTES BUT THEY SET OUT AGAIN AT A
GALLOP
THE PLAIN WAS GLOOMY LOW HANGING BLACK CRISP FOGS CREPT OVER THE
HILLS AND WRENCHED THEMSELVES AWAY LIKE SMOKE THERE WERE WHITISH GLEAMS
IN THE CLOUDS A STRONG BREEZE WHICH BLEW IN FROM THE SEA PRODUCED A
SOUND IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE HORIZON AS OF SOME ONE MOVING FURNITURE
EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE SEEN ASSUMED ATTITUDES OF TERROR
HOW MANY
THINGS SHIVER BENEATH THESE VAST BREATHS OF THE NIGHT
HE WAS STIFF WITH COLD HE HAD EATEN NOTHING SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE
HE VAGUELY RECALLED HIS OTHER NOCTURNAL TRIP IN THE VAST PLAIN IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF D EIGHT YEARS PREVIOUSLY AND IT SEEMED BUT
YESTERDAY
THE HOUR STRUCK FROM A DISTANT TOWER HE ASKED THE BOY
WHAT TIME IS IT
SEVEN O'CLOCK SIR WE SHALL REACH ARRAS AT EIGHT WE HAVE BUT THREE
LEAGUES STILL TO GO
AT THAT MOMENT HE FOR THE FIRST TIME INDULGED IN THIS REFLECTION
THINKING IT ODD THE WHILE THAT IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM SOONER THAT
ALL THIS TROUBLE WHICH HE WAS TAKING WAS PERHAPS USELESS THAT HE DID
NOT KNOW SO MUCH AS THE HOUR OF THE TRIAL THAT HE SHOULD AT LEAST
HAVE INFORMED HIMSELF OF THAT THAT HE WAS FOOLISH TO GO THUS STRAIGHT
AHEAD WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER HE WOULD BE OF ANY SERVICE OR NOT THEN
HE SKETCHED OUT SOME CALCULATIONS IN HIS MIND THAT ORDINARILY THE
SITTINGS OF THE COURT OF ASSIZES BEGAN AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THAT IT COULD NOT BE A LONG AFFAIR THAT THE THEFT OF THE APPLES WOULD
BE VERY BRIEF THAT THERE WOULD THEN REMAIN ONLY A QUESTION OF IDENTITY
FOUR OR FIVE DEPOSITIONS AND VERY LITTLE FOR THE LAWYERS TO SAY THAT
HE SHOULD ARRIVE AFTER ALL WAS OVER
THE POSTILION WHIPPED UP THE HORSES THEY HAD CROSSED THE RIVER AND LEFT
MONT SAINT ELOY BEHIND THEM
THE NIGHT GREW MORE PROFOUND
CHAPTER VI SISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOF
BUT AT THAT MOMENT FANTINE WAS JOYOUS
SHE HAD PASSED A VERY BAD NIGHT HER COUGH WAS FRIGHTFUL HER FEVER
HAD DOUBLED IN INTENSITY SHE HAD HAD DREAMS IN THE MORNING WHEN THE
DOCTOR PAID HIS VISIT SHE WAS DELIRIOUS HE ASSUMED AN ALARMED LOOK
AND ORDERED THAT HE SHOULD BE INFORMED AS SOON AS M
MADELEINE ARRIVED
ALL THE MORNING SHE WAS MELANCHOLY SAID BUT LITTLE AND LAID PLAITS
IN HER SHEETS MURMURING THE WHILE IN A LOW VOICE CALCULATIONS
WHICH SEEMED TO BE CALCULATIONS OF DISTANCES
HER EYES WERE HOLLOW AND
STARING
THEY SEEMED ALMOST EXTINGUISHED AT INTERVALS THEN LIGHTED UP
AGAIN AND SHONE LIKE STARS
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH AT THE APPROACH OF A
CERTAIN DARK HOUR THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN FILLS THOSE WHO ARE QUITTING THE
LIGHT OF EARTH
EACH TIME THAT SISTER SIMPLICE ASKED HER HOW SHE FELT SHE REPLIED
INVARIABLY WELL
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE M
MADELEINE
SOME MONTHS BEFORE THIS AT THE MOMENT WHEN FANTINE HAD JUST LOST HER
LAST MODESTY HER LAST SHAME AND HER LAST JOY SHE WAS THE SHADOW OF
HERSELF NOW SHE WAS THE SPECTRE OF HERSELF
PHYSICAL SUFFERING HAD
COMPLETED THE WORK OF MORAL SUFFERING
THIS CREATURE OF FIVE AND TWENTY
HAD A WRINKLED BROW FLABBY CHEEKS PINCHED NOSTRILS TEETH FROM WHICH
THE GUMS HAD RECEDED A LEADEN COMPLEXION A BONY NECK PROMINENT
SHOULDER BLADES FRAIL LIMBS A CLAYEY SKIN AND HER GOLDEN HAIR WAS
GROWING OUT SPRINKLED WITH GRAY
ALAS HOW ILLNESS IMPROVISES OLD AGE
AT MID DAY THE PHYSICIAN RETURNED GAVE SOME DIRECTIONS INQUIRED
WHETHER THE MAYOR HAD MADE HIS APPEARANCE AT THE INFIRMARY AND SHOOK
HIS HEAD
M
MADELEINE USUALLY CAME TO SEE THE INVALID AT THREE O'CLOCK
AS
EXACTNESS IS KINDNESS HE WAS EXACT
ABOUT HALF PAST TWO FANTINE BEGAN TO BE RESTLESS
IN THE COURSE OF
TWENTY MINUTES SHE ASKED THE NUN MORE THAN TEN TIMES WHAT TIME IS IT
SISTER
THREE O'CLOCK STRUCK
AT THE THIRD STROKE FANTINE SAT UP IN BED SHE
WHO COULD IN GENERAL HARDLY TURN OVER JOINED HER YELLOW FLESHLESS
HANDS IN A SORT OF CONVULSIVE CLASP AND THE NUN HEARD HER UTTER ONE
OF THOSE PROFOUND SIGHS WHICH SEEM TO THROW OFF DEJECTION
THEN FANTINE
TURNED AND LOOKED AT THE DOOR
NO ONE ENTERED THE DOOR DID NOT OPEN
SHE REMAINED THUS FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HER EYES RIVETED ON THE
DOOR MOTIONLESS AND APPARENTLY HOLDING HER BREATH
THE SISTER DARED NOT
SPEAK TO HER
THE CLOCK STRUCK A QUARTER PAST THREE
FANTINE FELL BACK
ON HER PILLOW
SHE SAID NOTHING BUT BEGAN TO PLAIT THE SHEETS ONCE MORE
HALF AN HOUR PASSED THEN AN HOUR NO ONE CAME EVERY TIME THE CLOCK
STRUCK FANTINE STARTED UP AND LOOKED TOWARDS THE DOOR THEN FELL BACK
AGAIN
HER THOUGHT WAS CLEARLY PERCEPTIBLE BUT SHE UTTERED NO NAME SHE MADE
NO COMPLAINT SHE BLAMED NO ONE
BUT SHE COUGHED IN A MELANCHOLY WAY
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT SOMETHING DARK WAS DESCENDING UPON HER
SHE WAS
LIVID AND HER LIPS WERE BLUE
SHE SMILED NOW AND THEN
FIVE O'CLOCK STRUCK
THEN THE SISTER HEARD HER SAY VERY LOW AND GENTLY
HE IS WRONG NOT TO COME TO DAY SINCE I AM GOING AWAY TO MORROW
SISTER SIMPLICE HERSELF WAS SURPRISED AT M
MADELEINE'S DELAY
IN THE MEANTIME FANTINE WAS STARING AT THE TESTER OF HER BED
SHE
SEEMED TO BE ENDEAVORING TO RECALL SOMETHING
ALL AT ONCE SHE BEGAN TO
SING IN A VOICE AS FEEBLE AS A BREATH
THE NUN LISTENED
THIS IS WHAT
FANTINE WAS SINGING
LOVELY THINGS WE WILL BUY
AS WE STROLL THE FAUBOURGS THROUGH
ROSES ARE PINK CORN FLOWERS ARE BLUE
I LOVE MY LOVE CORN FLOWERS ARE BLUE
YESTERE'EN THE VIRGIN MARY CAME NEAR MY STOVE IN A BROIDERED MANTLE
CLAD AND SAID TO ME 'HERE HIDE 'NEATH MY VEIL THE CHILD WHOM YOU
ONE DAY BEGGED FROM ME
HASTE TO THE CITY BUY LINEN BUY A NEEDLE BUY
THREAD
LOVELY THINGS WE WILL BUY
AS WE STROLL THE FAUBOURGS THROUGH

LOVELY THINGS WE WILL BUY
AS WE STROLL THE FAUBOURGS THROUGH
ROSES ARE PINK CORN FLOWERS ARE BLUE
I LOVE MY LOVE CORN FLOWERS ARE BLUE
THIS SONG WAS AN OLD CRADLE ROMANCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD IN FORMER DAYS
LULLED HER LITTLE COSETTE TO SLEEP AND WHICH HAD NEVER RECURRED TO HER
MIND IN ALL THE FIVE YEARS DURING WHICH SHE HAD BEEN PARTED FROM HER
CHILD
SHE SANG IT IN SO SAD A VOICE AND TO SO SWEET AN AIR THAT IT
WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY ONE EVEN A NUN WEEP
THE SISTER ACCUSTOMED AS
SHE WAS TO AUSTERITIES FELT A TEAR SPRING TO HER EYES
THE CLOCK STRUCK SIX
FANTINE DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR IT
SHE NO LONGER
SEEMED TO PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING ABOUT HER
SISTER SIMPLICE SENT A SERVING MAID TO INQUIRE OF THE PORTRESS OF THE
FACTORY WHETHER THE MAYOR HAD RETURNED AND IF HE WOULD NOT COME TO THE
INFIRMARY SOON
THE GIRL RETURNED IN A FEW MINUTES
FANTINE WAS STILL MOTIONLESS AND SEEMED ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS
THE SERVANT INFORMED SISTER SIMPLICE IN A VERY LOW TONE THAT THE
MAYOR HAD SET OUT THAT MORNING BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK IN A LITTLE TILBURY
HARNESSED TO A WHITE HORSE COLD AS THE WEATHER WAS THAT HE HAD GONE
ALONE WITHOUT EVEN A DRIVER THAT NO ONE KNEW WHAT ROAD HE HAD TAKEN
THAT PEOPLE SAID HE HAD BEEN SEEN TO TURN INTO THE ROAD TO ARRAS THAT
OTHERS ASSERTED THAT THEY HAD MET HIM ON THE ROAD TO PARIS
THAT WHEN HE
WENT AWAY HE HAD BEEN VERY GENTLE AS USUAL AND THAT HE HAD MERELY TOLD
THE PORTRESS NOT TO EXPECT HIM THAT NIGHT
WHILE THE TWO WOMEN WERE WHISPERING TOGETHER WITH THEIR BACKS TURNED
TO FANTINE'S BED THE SISTER INTERROGATING THE SERVANT CONJECTURING
FANTINE WITH THE FEVERISH VIVACITY OF CERTAIN ORGANIC MALADIES WHICH
UNITE THE FREE MOVEMENTS OF HEALTH WITH THE FRIGHTFUL EMACIATION OF
DEATH HAD RAISED HERSELF TO HER KNEES IN BED WITH HER SHRIVELLED HANDS
RESTING ON THE BOLSTER AND HER HEAD THRUST THROUGH THE OPENING OF THE
CURTAINS AND WAS LISTENING
ALL AT ONCE SHE CRIED
YOU ARE SPEAKING OF M
MADELEINE WHY ARE YOU TALKING SO LOW WHAT IS
HE DOING WHY DOES HE NOT COME
HER VOICE WAS SO ABRUPT AND HOARSE THAT THE TWO WOMEN THOUGHT THEY HEARD
THE VOICE OF A MAN THEY WHEELED ROUND IN AFFRIGHT
ANSWER ME CRIED FANTINE
THE SERVANT STAMMERED
THE PORTRESS TOLD ME THAT HE COULD NOT COME TO DAY
BE CALM MY CHILD SAID THE SISTER LIE DOWN AGAIN
FANTINE WITHOUT CHANGING HER ATTITUDE CONTINUED IN A LOUD VOICE AND
WITH AN ACCENT THAT WAS BOTH IMPERIOUS AND HEART RENDING
HE CANNOT COME WHY NOT YOU KNOW THE REASON
YOU ARE WHISPERING IT TO
EACH OTHER THERE
I WANT TO KNOW IT
THE SERVANT MAID HASTENED TO SAY IN THE NUN'S EAR SAY THAT HE IS BUSY
WITH THE CITY COUNCIL
SISTER SIMPLICE BLUSHED FAINTLY FOR IT WAS A LIE THAT THE MAID HAD
PROPOSED TO HER
ON THE OTHER HAND IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THE MERE COMMUNICATION OF THE
TRUTH TO THE INVALID WOULD WITHOUT DOUBT DEAL HER A TERRIBLE BLOW AND
THAT THIS WAS A SERIOUS MATTER IN FANTINE'S PRESENT STATE
HER FLUSH
DID NOT LAST LONG THE SISTER RAISED HER CALM SAD EYES TO FANTINE AND
SAID MONSIEUR LE MAIRE HAS GONE AWAY
FANTINE RAISED HERSELF AND CROUCHED ON HER HEELS IN THE BED HER EYES
SPARKLED INDESCRIBABLE JOY BEAMED FROM THAT MELANCHOLY FACE
GONE SHE CRIED HE HAS GONE TO GET COSETTE
THEN SHE RAISED HER ARMS TO HEAVEN AND HER WHITE FACE BECAME INEFFABLE
HER LIPS MOVED SHE WAS PRAYING IN A LOW VOICE
WHEN HER PRAYER WAS FINISHED SISTER SHE SAID I AM WILLING TO LIE

I KNOW THAT WELL MY GOOD SISTER BUT YOU SEE I AM VERY HAPPY THE

MONTFERMEIL TO GET MY LITTLE COSETTE
SHE LAY DOWN AGAIN WITH THE NUN'S ASSISTANCE HELPED THE NUN TO ARRANGE
HER PILLOW AND KISSED THE LITTLE SILVER CROSS WHICH SHE WORE ON HER
NECK AND WHICH SISTER SIMPLICE HAD GIVEN HER
MY CHILD SAID THE SISTER TRY TO REST NOW AND DO NOT TALK ANY

FANTINE TOOK THE SISTER'S HAND IN HER MOIST HANDS AND THE LATTER WAS
PAINED TO FEEL THAT PERSPIRATION
HE SET OUT THIS MORNING FOR PARIS IN FACT HE NEED NOT EVEN GO THROUGH

LETTER SO THAT SHE COULD BE TAKEN FROM THE THENARDIERS THEY CANNOT

FIRST PLACE SHE WILL HAVE VERY BEAUTIFUL HANDS SHE HAD RIDICULOUS
HANDS WHEN SHE WAS ONLY A YEAR OLD LIKE THIS SHE MUST BE A BIG GIRL
NOW SHE IS SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE IS QUITE A YOUNG LADY I CALL HER
COSETTE BUT HER NAME IS REALLY EUPHRASIE
STOP THIS MORNING I WAS
LOOKING AT THE DUST ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE AND I HAD A SORT OF IDEA COME
ACROSS ME LIKE THAT THAT I SHOULD SEE COSETTE AGAIN SOON
MON DIEU
HOW WRONG IT IS NOT TO SEE ONE'S CHILDREN FOR YEARS ONE OUGHT TO
REFLECT THAT LIFE IS NOT ETERNAL
OH HOW GOOD M
LE MAIRE IS TO GO IT

MORNING SISTER YOU MUST REMIND ME TO PUT ON MY LITTLE CAP THAT HAS

WHAT A PLACE THAT MONTFERMEIL IS I TOOK THAT JOURNEY ON
FOOT ONCE IT WAS VERY LONG FOR ME BUT THE DILIGENCES GO VERY QUICKLY
HE WILL BE HERE TO MORROW WITH COSETTE HOW FAR IS IT FROM HERE TO
MONTFERMEIL
THE SISTER WHO HAD NO IDEA OF DISTANCES REPLIED OH I THINK THAT HE
WILL BE HERE TO MORROW
TO MORROW TO MORROW SAID FANTINE I SHALL SEE COSETTE TO MORROW
YOU SEE GOOD SISTER OF THE GOOD GOD THAT I AM NO LONGER ILL I AM MAD
I COULD DANCE IF ANY ONE WISHED IT
A PERSON WHO HAD SEEN HER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY WOULD NOT HAVE
UNDERSTOOD THE CHANGE SHE WAS ALL ROSY NOW SHE SPOKE IN A LIVELY AND
NATURAL VOICE HER WHOLE FACE WAS ONE SMILE NOW AND THEN SHE TALKED
SHE LAUGHED SOFTLY THE JOY OF A MOTHER IS ALMOST INFANTILE
WELL RESUMED THE NUN NOW THAT YOU ARE HAPPY MIND ME AND DO NOT
TALK ANY MORE
FANTINE LAID HER HEAD ON HER PILLOW AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE YES
LIE DOWN AGAIN BE GOOD FOR YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE YOUR CHILD SISTER
SIMPLICE IS RIGHT EVERY ONE HERE IS RIGHT
AND THEN WITHOUT STIRRING WITHOUT EVEN MOVING HER HEAD SHE BEGAN TO
STARE ALL ABOUT HER WITH WIDE OPEN EYES AND A JOYOUS AIR AND SHE SAID
NOTHING MORE
THE SISTER DREW THE CURTAINS TOGETHER AGAIN HOPING THAT SHE WOULD
FALL INTO A DOZE
BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT O'CLOCK THE DOCTOR CAME NOT
HEARING ANY SOUND HE THOUGHT FANTINE WAS ASLEEP ENTERED SOFTLY AND
APPROACHED THE BED ON TIPTOE HE OPENED THE CURTAINS A LITTLE AND BY
THE LIGHT OF THE TAPER HE SAW FANTINE'S BIG EYES GAZING AT HIM
SHE SAID TO HIM SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO SLEEP BESIDE ME IN A LITTLE
BED WILL SHE NOT SIR
THE DOCTOR THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS DELIRIOUS
SHE ADDED
SEE THERE IS JUST ROOM
THE DOCTOR TOOK SISTER SIMPLICE ASIDE AND SHE EXPLAINED MATTERS TO HIM
THAT M
MADELEINE WAS ABSENT FOR A DAY OR TWO AND THAT IN THEIR DOUBT
THEY HAD NOT THOUGHT IT WELL TO UNDECEIVE THE INVALID WHO BELIEVED THAT
THE MAYOR HAD GONE TO MONTFERMEIL THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE AFTER ALL THAT
HER GUESS WAS CORRECT THE DOCTOR APPROVED
HE RETURNED TO FANTINE'S BED AND SHE WENT ON
YOU SEE WHEN SHE WAKES UP IN THE MORNING I SHALL BE ABLE TO SAY GOOD
MORNING TO HER POOR KITTEN AND WHEN I CANNOT SLEEP AT NIGHT I CAN
HEAR HER ASLEEP HER LITTLE GENTLE BREATHING WILL DO ME GOOD
GIVE ME YOUR HAND SAID THE DOCTOR
SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARM AND EXCLAIMED WITH A LAUGH
AH HOLD IN TRUTH YOU DID NOT KNOW IT I AM CURED COSETTE WILL
ARRIVE TO MORROW
THE DOCTOR WAS SURPRISED SHE WAS BETTER THE PRESSURE ON HER CHEST
HAD DECREASED HER PULSE HAD REGAINED ITS STRENGTH A SORT OF LIFE HAD
SUDDENLY SUPERVENED AND REANIMATED THIS POOR WORN OUT CREATURE
DOCTOR SHE WENT ON DID THE SISTER TELL YOU THAT M
LE MAIRE HAS
GONE TO GET THAT MITE OF A CHILD
THE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED SILENCE AND THAT ALL PAINFUL EMOTIONS SHOULD BE
AVOIDED HE PRESCRIBED AN INFUSION OF PURE CHINCHONA AND IN CASE THE
FEVER SHOULD INCREASE AGAIN DURING THE NIGHT A CALMING POTION
AS HE
TOOK HIS DEPARTURE HE SAID TO THE SISTER
SHE IS DOING BETTER IF GOOD LUCK WILLED THAT THE MAYOR SHOULD
ACTUALLY ARRIVE TO MORROW WITH THE CHILD WHO KNOWS THERE ARE CRISES
SO ASTOUNDING GREAT JOY HAS BEEN KNOWN TO ARREST MALADIES I KNOW WELL
THAT THIS IS AN ORGANIC DISEASE AND IN AN ADVANCED STATE BUT ALL THOSE
THINGS ARE SUCH MYSTERIES WE MAY BE ABLE TO SAVE HER
CHAPTER VII THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FOR
DEPARTURE
IT WAS NEARLY EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING WHEN THE CART WHICH WE
LEFT ON THE ROAD ENTERED THE PORTE COCHERE OF THE HOTEL DE LA POSTE IN
ARRAS THE MAN WHOM WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING UP TO THIS MOMENT ALIGHTED
FROM IT RESPONDED WITH AN ABSTRACTED AIR TO THE ATTENTIONS OF THE
PEOPLE OF THE INN SENT BACK THE EXTRA HORSE AND WITH HIS OWN HANDS
LED THE LITTLE WHITE HORSE TO THE STABLE THEN HE OPENED THE DOOR OF A
BILLIARD ROOM WHICH WAS SITUATED ON THE GROUND FLOOR SAT DOWN THERE
AND LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON A TABLE HE HAD TAKEN FOURTEEN HOURS FOR
THE JOURNEY WHICH HE HAD COUNTED ON MAKING IN SIX HE DID HIMSELF THE
JUSTICE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT BUT AT BOTTOM HE WAS
NOT SORRY
THE LANDLADY OF THE HOTEL ENTERED
DOES MONSIEUR WISH A BED DOES MONSIEUR REQUIRE SUPPER
HE MADE A SIGN OF THE HEAD IN THE NEGATIVE
THE STABLEMAN SAYS THAT MONSIEUR'S HORSE IS EXTREMELY FATIGUED
HERE HE BROKE HIS SILENCE
WILL NOT THE HORSE BE IN A CONDITION TO SET OUT AGAIN TO MORROW
MORNING
OH MONSIEUR HE MUST REST FOR TWO DAYS AT LEAST
HE INQUIRED
IS NOT THE POSTING STATION LOCATED HERE
YES SIR
THE HOSTESS CONDUCTED HIM TO THE OFFICE HE SHOWED HIS PASSPORT AND
INQUIRED WHETHER THERE WAS ANY WAY OF RETURNING THAT SAME NIGHT TO M
SUR M
BY THE MAIL WAGON THE SEAT BESIDE THE POST BOY CHANCED TO BE
VACANT HE ENGAGED IT AND PAID FOR IT
MONSIEUR SAID THE CLERK
DO NOT FAIL TO BE HERE READY TO START AT PRECISELY ONE O'CLOCK IN THE
MORNING
THIS DONE HE LEFT THE HOTEL AND BEGAN TO WANDER ABOUT THE TOWN
HE WAS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ARRAS THE STREETS WERE DARK AND HE
WALKED ON AT RANDOM BUT HE SEEMED BENT UPON NOT ASKING THE WAY OF THE
PASSERS BY
HE CROSSED THE LITTLE RIVER CRINCHON AND FOUND HIMSELF IN A
LABYRINTH OF NARROW ALLEYS WHERE HE LOST HIS WAY
A CITIZEN WAS PASSING
ALONG WITH A LANTERN
AFTER SOME HESITATION HE DECIDED TO APPLY TO THIS
MAN NOT WITHOUT HAVING FIRST GLANCED BEHIND AND IN FRONT OF HIM AS
THOUGH HE FEARED LEST SOME ONE SHOULD HEAR THE QUESTION WHICH HE WAS
ABOUT TO PUT
MONSIEUR SAID HE WHERE IS THE COURT HOUSE IF YOU PLEASE
YOU DO NOT BELONG IN TOWN SIR REPLIED THE BOURGEOIS WHO WAS AN
OLDISH MAN WELL FOLLOW ME
I HAPPEN TO BE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF
THE COURT HOUSE THAT IS TO SAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HOTEL OF THE
PREFECTURE FOR THE COURT HOUSE IS UNDERGOING REPAIRS JUST AT THIS
MOMENT AND THE COURTS ARE HOLDING THEIR SITTINGS PROVISIONALLY IN THE
PREFECTURE
IS IT THERE THAT THE ASSIZES ARE HELD HE ASKED
CERTAINLY SIR YOU SEE THE PREFECTURE OF TO DAY WAS THE BISHOP'S
PALACE BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
M
DE CONZIE WHO WAS BISHOP IN '82 BUILT
A GRAND HALL THERE
IT IS IN THIS GRAND HALL THAT THE COURT IS HELD
ON THE WAY THE BOURGEOIS SAID TO HIM
IF MONSIEUR DESIRES TO WITNESS A CASE IT IS RATHER LATE
THE SITTINGS
GENERALLY CLOSE AT SIX O'CLOCK
WHEN THEY ARRIVED ON THE GRAND SQUARE HOWEVER THE MAN POINTED OUT TO
HIM FOUR LONG WINDOWS ALL LIGHTED UP IN THE FRONT OF A VAST AND GLOOMY
BUILDING
UPON MY WORD SIR YOU ARE IN LUCK YOU HAVE ARRIVED IN SEASON
DO YOU
SEE THOSE FOUR WINDOWS THAT IS THE COURT OF ASSIZES
THERE IS LIGHT
THERE SO THEY ARE NOT THROUGH
THE MATTER MUST HAVE BEEN GREATLY
PROTRACTED AND THEY ARE HOLDING AN EVENING SESSION
DO YOU TAKE AN
INTEREST IN THIS AFFAIR IS IT A CRIMINAL CASE ARE YOU A WITNESS
HE REPLIED
I HAVE NOT COME ON ANY BUSINESS I ONLY WISH TO SPEAK TO ONE OF THE
LAWYERS
THAT IS DIFFERENT SAID THE BOURGEOIS
STOP SIR HERE IS THE DOOR
WHERE THE SENTRY STANDS
YOU HAVE ONLY TO ASCEND THE GRAND STAIRCASE
HE CONFORMED TO THE BOURGEOIS'S DIRECTIONS AND A FEW MINUTES LATER HE
WAS IN A HALL CONTAINING MANY PEOPLE AND WHERE GROUPS INTERMINGLED
WITH LAWYERS IN THEIR GOWNS WERE WHISPERING TOGETHER HERE AND THERE
IT IS ALWAYS A HEART BREAKING THING TO SEE THESE CONGREGATIONS OF MEN
ROBED IN BLACK MURMURING TOGETHER IN LOW VOICES ON THE THRESHOLD OF
THE HALLS OF JUSTICE
IT IS RARE THAT CHARITY AND PITY ARE THE OUTCOME
OF THESE WORDS
CONDEMNATIONS PRONOUNCED IN ADVANCE ARE MORE LIKELY
TO BE THE RESULT
ALL THESE GROUPS SEEM TO THE PASSING AND THOUGHTFUL
OBSERVER SO MANY SOMBRE HIVES WHERE BUZZING SPIRITS CONSTRUCT IN CONCERT
ALL SORTS OF DARK EDIFICES
THIS SPACIOUS HALL ILLUMINATED BY A SINGLE LAMP WAS THE OLD HALL OF
THE EPISCOPAL PALACE AND SERVED AS THE LARGE HALL OF THE PALACE
OF JUSTICE
A DOUBLE LEAVED DOOR WHICH WAS CLOSED AT THAT MOMENT
SEPARATED IT FROM THE LARGE APARTMENT WHERE THE COURT WAS SITTING
THE OBSCURITY WAS SUCH THAT HE DID NOT FEAR TO ACCOST THE FIRST LAWYER
WHOM HE MET
WHAT STAGE HAVE THEY REACHED SIR HE ASKED
IT IS FINISHED SAID THE LAWYER
FINISHED
THIS WORD WAS REPEATED IN SUCH ACCENTS THAT THE LAWYER TURNED ROUND
EXCUSE ME SIR PERHAPS YOU ARE A RELATIVE
NO I KNOW NO ONE HERE
HAS JUDGMENT BEEN PRONOUNCED
OF COURSE
NOTHING ELSE WAS POSSIBLE
TO PENAL SERVITUDE
FOR LIFE
HE CONTINUED IN A VOICE SO WEAK THAT IT WAS BARELY AUDIBLE
THEN HIS IDENTITY WAS ESTABLISHED
WHAT IDENTITY REPLIED THE LAWYER
THERE WAS NO IDENTITY TO BE
ESTABLISHED
THE MATTER WAS VERY SIMPLE
THE WOMAN HAD MURDERED HER
CHILD THE INFANTICIDE WAS PROVED THE JURY THREW OUT THE QUESTION OF
PREMEDITATION AND SHE WAS CONDEMNED FOR LIFE
SO IT WAS A WOMAN SAID HE
WHY CERTAINLY
THE LIMOSIN WOMAN
OF WHAT ARE YOU SPEAKING
NOTHING
BUT SINCE IT IS ALL OVER HOW COMES IT THAT THE HALL IS STILL
LIGHTED
FOR ANOTHER CASE WHICH WAS BEGUN ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO
WHAT OTHER CASE
OH THIS ONE IS A CLEAR CASE ALSO
IT IS ABOUT A SORT OF BLACKGUARD
A MAN ARRESTED FOR A SECOND OFFENCE A CONVICT WHO HAS BEEN GUILTY OF
THEFT
I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME EXACTLY
THERE'S A BANDIT'S PHIZ FOR YOU
I'D SEND HIM TO THE GALLEYS ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS FACE ALONE
IS THERE ANY WAY OF GETTING INTO THE COURT ROOM SIR SAID HE
I REALLY THINK THAT THERE IS NOT
THERE IS A GREAT CROWD
HOWEVER
THE HEARING HAS BEEN SUSPENDED
SOME PEOPLE HAVE GONE OUT AND WHEN THE
HEARING IS RESUMED YOU MIGHT MAKE AN EFFORT
WHERE IS THE ENTRANCE
THROUGH YONDER LARGE DOOR
THE LAWYER LEFT HIM
IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD EXPERIENCED
ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY ALMOST INTERMINGLED WITH EACH OTHER ALL POSSIBLE
EMOTIONS
THE WORDS OF THIS INDIFFERENT SPECTATOR HAD IN TURN PIERCED
HIS HEART LIKE NEEDLES OF ICE AND LIKE BLADES OF FIRE
WHEN HE SAW THAT
NOTHING WAS SETTLED HE BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE BUT HE COULD NOT HAVE
TOLD WHETHER WHAT HE FELT WAS PAIN OR PLEASURE
HE DREW NEAR TO MANY GROUPS AND LISTENED TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING
THE
DOCKET OF THE SESSION WAS VERY HEAVY THE PRESIDENT HAD APPOINTED
FOR THE SAME DAY TWO SHORT AND SIMPLE CASES
THEY HAD BEGUN WITH THE
INFANTICIDE AND NOW THEY HAD REACHED THE CONVICT THE OLD OFFENDER THE
RETURN HORSE THIS MAN HAD STOLEN APPLES BUT THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO
BE ENTIRELY PROVED WHAT HAD BEEN PROVED WAS THAT HE HAD ALREADY BEEN
IN THE GALLEYS AT TOULON
IT WAS THAT WHICH LENT A BAD ASPECT TO
HIS CASE
HOWEVER THE MAN'S EXAMINATION AND THE DEPOSITIONS OF THE
WITNESSES HAD BEEN COMPLETED BUT THE LAWYER'S PLEA AND THE SPEECH
OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR WERE STILL TO COME IT COULD NOT BE
FINISHED BEFORE MIDNIGHT
THE MAN WOULD PROBABLY BE CONDEMNED THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS VERY CLEVER AND NEVER MISSED HIS CULPRITS HE WAS
A BRILLIANT FELLOW WHO WROTE VERSES
AN USHER STOOD AT THE DOOR COMMUNICATING WITH THE HALL OF THE ASSIZES
HE INQUIRED OF THIS USHER
WILL THE DOOR BE OPENED SOON SIR
IT WILL NOT BE OPENED AT ALL REPLIED THE USHER
WHAT IT WILL NOT BE OPENED WHEN THE HEARING IS RESUMED IS NOT THE
HEARING SUSPENDED
THE HEARING HAS JUST BEEN BEGUN AGAIN REPLIED THE USHER BUT THE
DOOR WILL NOT BE OPENED AGAIN
WHY
BECAUSE THE HALL IS FULL
WHAT THERE IS NOT ROOM FOR ONE MORE
NOT ANOTHER ONE
THE DOOR IS CLOSED
NO ONE CAN ENTER NOW
THE USHER ADDED AFTER A PAUSE THERE ARE TO TELL THE TRUTH TWO
OR THREE EXTRA PLACES BEHIND MONSIEUR LE PRESIDENT BUT MONSIEUR LE
PRESIDENT ONLY ADMITS PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES TO THEM
SO SAYING THE USHER TURNED HIS BACK
HE RETIRED WITH BOWED HEAD TRAVERSED THE ANTECHAMBER AND SLOWLY
DESCENDED THE STAIRS AS THOUGH HESITATING AT EVERY STEP
IT IS PROBABLE
THAT HE WAS HOLDING COUNSEL WITH HIMSELF
THE VIOLENT CONFLICT WHICH HAD
BEEN GOING ON WITHIN HIM SINCE THE PRECEDING EVENING WAS NOT YET ENDED
AND EVERY MOMENT HE ENCOUNTERED SOME NEW PHASE OF IT
ON REACHING THE
LANDING PLACE HE LEANED HIS BACK AGAINST THE BALUSTERS AND FOLDED HIS
ARMS
ALL AT ONCE HE OPENED HIS COAT DREW OUT HIS POCKET BOOK TOOK
FROM IT A PENCIL TORE OUT A LEAF AND UPON THAT LEAF HE WROTE RAPIDLY
BY THE LIGHT OF THE STREET LANTERN THIS LINE M
MADELEINE MAYOR OF M
SUR M THEN HE ASCENDED THE STAIRS ONCE MORE WITH GREAT STRIDES MADE
HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE USHER HANDED HIM
THE PAPER AND SAID IN AN AUTHORITATIVE MANNER
TAKE THIS TO MONSIEUR LE PRESIDENT
THE USHER TOOK THE PAPER CAST A GLANCE UPON IT AND OBEYED
CHAPTER VIII AN ENTRANCE BY FAVOR
ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SUSPECT THE FACT THE MAYOR OF M
SUR M
ENJOYED
A SORT OF CELEBRITY
FOR THE SPACE OF SEVEN YEARS HIS REPUTATION FOR
VIRTUE HAD FILLED THE WHOLE OF BAS BOULONNAIS IT HAD EVENTUALLY PASSED
THE CONFINES OF A SMALL DISTRICT AND HAD BEEN SPREAD ABROAD THROUGH
TWO OR THREE NEIGHBORING DEPARTMENTS
BESIDES THE SERVICE WHICH HE HAD
RENDERED TO THE CHIEF TOWN BY RESUSCITATING THE BLACK JET INDUSTRY
THERE WAS NOT ONE OUT OF THE HUNDRED AND FORTY COMMUNES OF THE
ARRONDISSEMENT OF M
SUR M
WHICH WAS NOT INDEBTED TO HIM FOR SOME
BENEFIT
HE HAD EVEN AT NEED CONTRIVED TO AID AND MULTIPLY THE
INDUSTRIES OF OTHER ARRONDISSEMENTS
IT WAS THUS THAT HE HAD WHEN
OCCASION OFFERED SUPPORTED WITH HIS CREDIT AND HIS FUNDS THE LINEN
FACTORY AT BOULOGNE THE FLAX SPINNING INDUSTRY AT FREVENT AND THE
HYDRAULIC MANUFACTURE OF CLOTH AT BOUBERS SUR CANCHE
EVERYWHERE THE
NAME OF M
MADELEINE WAS PRONOUNCED WITH VENERATION
ARRAS AND DOUAI
ENVIED THE HAPPY LITTLE TOWN OF M
SUR M
ITS MAYOR
THE COUNCILLOR OF THE ROYAL COURT OF DOUAI WHO WAS PRESIDING OVER THIS
SESSION OF THE ASSIZES AT ARRAS WAS ACQUAINTED IN COMMON WITH THE REST
OF THE WORLD WITH THIS NAME WHICH WAS SO PROFOUNDLY AND UNIVERSALLY
HONORED
WHEN THE USHER DISCREETLY OPENING THE DOOR WHICH CONNECTED
THE COUNCIL CHAMBER WITH THE COURT ROOM BENT OVER THE BACK OF THE
PRESIDENT'S ARM CHAIR AND HANDED HIM THE PAPER ON WHICH WAS INSCRIBED
THE LINE WHICH WE HAVE JUST PERUSED ADDING THE GENTLEMAN DESIRES TO
BE PRESENT AT THE TRIAL THE PRESIDENT WITH A QUICK AND DEFERENTIAL
MOVEMENT SEIZED A PEN AND WROTE A FEW WORDS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAPER
AND RETURNED IT TO THE USHER SAYING ADMIT HIM
THE UNHAPPY MAN WHOSE HISTORY WE ARE RELATING HAD REMAINED NEAR THE DOOR
OF THE HALL IN THE SAME PLACE AND THE SAME ATTITUDE IN WHICH THE USHER
HAD LEFT HIM
IN THE MIDST OF HIS REVERY HE HEARD SOME ONE SAYING TO
HIM WILL MONSIEUR DO ME THE HONOR TO FOLLOW ME IT WAS THE SAME USHER
WHO HAD TURNED HIS BACK UPON HIM BUT A MOMENT PREVIOUSLY AND WHO WAS
NOW BOWING TO THE EARTH BEFORE HIM
AT THE SAME TIME THE USHER HANDED
HIM THE PAPER
HE UNFOLDED IT AND AS HE CHANCED TO BE NEAR THE LIGHT
HE COULD READ IT
THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF ASSIZES PRESENTS HIS RESPECTS TO M
MADELEINE
HE CRUSHED THE PAPER IN HIS HAND AS THOUGH THOSE WORDS CONTAINED FOR HIM
A STRANGE AND BITTER AFTERTASTE
HE FOLLOWED THE USHER
A FEW MINUTES LATER HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE IN A SORT OF WAINSCOTED
CABINET OF SEVERE ASPECT LIGHTED BY TWO WAX CANDLES PLACED UPON A
TABLE WITH A GREEN CLOTH
THE LAST WORDS OF THE USHER WHO HAD JUST
QUITTED HIM STILL RANG IN HIS EARS MONSIEUR YOU ARE NOW IN THE
COUNCIL CHAMBER YOU HAVE ONLY TO TURN THE COPPER HANDLE OF YONDER DOOR
AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN THE COURT ROOM BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S
CHAIR THESE WORDS WERE MINGLED IN HIS THOUGHTS WITH A VAGUE MEMORY OF
NARROW CORRIDORS AND DARK STAIRCASES WHICH HE HAD RECENTLY TRAVERSED
THE USHER HAD LEFT HIM ALONE
THE SUPREME MOMENT HAD ARRIVED
HE SOUGHT
TO COLLECT HIS FACULTIES BUT COULD NOT
IT IS CHIEFLY AT THE MOMENT
WHEN THERE IS THE GREATEST NEED FOR ATTACHING THEM TO THE PAINFUL
REALITIES OF LIFE THAT THE THREADS OF THOUGHT SNAP WITHIN THE BRAIN
HE
WAS IN THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE JUDGES DELIBERATED AND CONDEMNED
WITH
STUPID TRANQUILLITY HE SURVEYED THIS PEACEFUL AND TERRIBLE APARTMENT
WHERE SO MANY LIVES HAD BEEN BROKEN WHICH WAS SOON TO RING WITH HIS
NAME AND WHICH HIS FATE WAS AT THAT MOMENT TRAVERSING
HE STARED AT
THE WALL THEN HE LOOKED AT HIMSELF WONDERING THAT IT SHOULD BE THAT
CHAMBER AND THAT IT SHOULD BE HE
HE HAD EATEN NOTHING FOR FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS HE WAS WORN OUT BY THE
JOLTS OF THE CART BUT HE WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT
HE FELT NOTHING
HE APPROACHED A BLACK FRAME WHICH WAS SUSPENDED ON THE WALL AND WHICH
CONTAINED UNDER GLASS AN ANCIENT AUTOGRAPH LETTER OF JEAN NICOLAS
PACHE MAYOR OF PARIS AND MINISTER AND DATED THROUGH AN ERROR NO
DOUBT THE 9TH OF JUNE OF THE YEAR II AND IN WHICH PACHE FORWARDED TO
THE COMMUNE THE LIST OF MINISTERS AND DEPUTIES HELD IN ARREST BY THEM
ANY SPECTATOR WHO HAD CHANCED TO SEE HIM AT THAT MOMENT AND WHO HAD
WATCHED HIM WOULD HAVE IMAGINED DOUBTLESS THAT THIS LETTER STRUCK HIM
AS VERY CURIOUS FOR HE DID NOT TAKE HIS EYES FROM IT AND HE READ IT
TWO OR THREE TIMES
HE READ IT WITHOUT PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO IT AND
UNCONSCIOUSLY
HE WAS THINKING OF FANTINE AND COSETTE
AS HE DREAMED HE TURNED ROUND AND HIS EYES FELL UPON THE BRASS KNOB
OF THE DOOR WHICH SEPARATED HIM FROM THE COURT OF ASSIZES
HE HAD ALMOST
FORGOTTEN THAT DOOR
HIS GLANCE CALM AT FIRST PAUSED THERE REMAINED
FIXED ON THAT BRASS HANDLE THEN GREW TERRIFIED AND LITTLE BY LITTLE
BECAME IMPREGNATED WITH FEAR
BEADS OF PERSPIRATION BURST FORTH AMONG
HIS HAIR AND TRICKLED DOWN UPON HIS TEMPLES
AT A CERTAIN MOMENT HE MADE THAT INDESCRIBABLE GESTURE OF A SORT OF
AUTHORITY MINGLED WITH REBELLION WHICH IS INTENDED TO CONVEY AND WHICH
DOES SO WELL CONVEY PARDIEU WHO COMPELS ME TO THIS THEN HE WHEELED
BRISKLY ROUND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH HE HAD ENTERED IN
FRONT OF HIM WENT TO IT OPENED IT AND PASSED OUT
HE WAS NO LONGER
IN THAT CHAMBER HE WAS OUTSIDE IN A CORRIDOR A LONG NARROW CORRIDOR
BROKEN BY STEPS AND GRATINGS MAKING ALL SORTS OF ANGLES LIGHTED
HERE AND THERE BY LANTERNS SIMILAR TO THE NIGHT TAPER OF INVALIDS THE
CORRIDOR THROUGH WHICH HE HAD APPROACHED
HE BREATHED HE LISTENED NOT
A SOUND IN FRONT NOT A SOUND BEHIND HIM AND HE FLED AS THOUGH PURSUED
WHEN HE HAD TURNED MANY ANGLES IN THIS CORRIDOR HE STILL LISTENED
THE
SAME SILENCE REIGNED AND THERE WAS THE SAME DARKNESS AROUND HIM
HE WAS
OUT OF BREATH HE STAGGERED HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL
THE STONE WAS
COLD THE PERSPIRATION LAY ICE COLD ON HIS BROW HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF
UP WITH A SHIVER
THEN THERE ALONE IN THE DARKNESS TREMBLING WITH COLD AND WITH
SOMETHING ELSE TOO PERCHANCE HE MEDITATED
HE HAD MEDITATED ALL NIGHT LONG HE HAD MEDITATED ALL THE DAY HE HEARD
WITHIN HIM BUT ONE VOICE WHICH SAID ALAS
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR PASSED THUS
AT LENGTH HE BOWED HIS HEAD SIGHED
WITH AGONY DROPPED HIS ARMS AND RETRACED HIS STEPS
HE WALKED SLOWLY
AND AS THOUGH CRUSHED
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME ONE HAD OVERTAKEN HIM IN
HIS FLIGHT AND WAS LEADING HIM BACK
HE RE ENTERED THE COUNCIL CHAMBER
THE FIRST THING HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF
WAS THE KNOB OF THE DOOR
THIS KNOB WHICH WAS ROUND AND OF POLISHED
BRASS SHONE LIKE A TERRIBLE STAR FOR HIM
HE GAZED AT IT AS A LAMB
MIGHT GAZE INTO THE EYE OF A TIGER
HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES FROM IT
FROM TIME TO TIME HE ADVANCED A STEP
AND APPROACHED THE DOOR
HAD HE LISTENED HE WOULD HAVE HEARD THE SOUND OF THE ADJOINING HALL
LIKE A SORT OF CONFUSED MURMUR BUT HE DID NOT LISTEN AND HE DID NOT
HEAR
SUDDENLY WITHOUT HIMSELF KNOWING HOW IT HAPPENED HE FOUND HIMSELF NEAR
THE DOOR HE GRASPED THE KNOB CONVULSIVELY THE DOOR OPENED
HE WAS IN THE COURT ROOM
CHAPTER IX A PLACE WHERE CONVICTIONS ARE IN PROCESS OF FORMATION
HE ADVANCED A PACE CLOSED THE DOOR MECHANICALLY BEHIND HIM AND
REMAINED STANDING CONTEMPLATING WHAT HE SAW
IT WAS A VAST AND BADLY LIGHTED APARTMENT NOW FULL OF UPROAR NOW FULL
OF SILENCE WHERE ALL THE APPARATUS OF A CRIMINAL CASE WITH ITS PETTY
AND MOURNFUL GRAVITY IN THE MIDST OF THE THRONG WAS IN PROCESS OF
DEVELOPMENT
AT THE ONE END OF THE HALL THE ONE WHERE HE WAS WERE JUDGES WITH
ABSTRACTED AIR IN THREADBARE ROBES WHO WERE GNAWING THEIR NAILS OR
CLOSING THEIR EYELIDS AT THE OTHER END A RAGGED CROWD LAWYERS IN
ALL SORTS OF ATTITUDES SOLDIERS WITH HARD BUT HONEST FACES ANCIENT
SPOTTED WOODWORK A DIRTY CEILING TABLES COVERED WITH SERGE THAT WAS
YELLOW RATHER THAN GREEN DOORS BLACKENED BY HANDMARKS TAP ROOM
LAMPS WHICH EMITTED MORE SMOKE THAN LIGHT SUSPENDED FROM NAILS IN
THE WAINSCOT ON THE TABLES CANDLES IN BRASS CANDLESTICKS DARKNESS
UGLINESS SADNESS AND FROM ALL THIS THERE WAS DISENGAGED AN AUSTERE AND
AUGUST IMPRESSION FOR ONE THERE FELT THAT GRAND HUMAN THING WHICH IS
CALLED THE LAW AND THAT GRAND DIVINE THING WHICH IS CALLED JUSTICE
NO ONE IN ALL THAT THRONG PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HIM ALL GLANCES WERE
DIRECTED TOWARDS A SINGLE POINT A WOODEN BENCH PLACED AGAINST A SMALL
DOOR IN THE STRETCH OF WALL ON THE PRESIDENT'S LEFT ON THIS BENCH
ILLUMINATED BY SEVERAL CANDLES SAT A MAN BETWEEN TWO GENDARMES
THIS MAN WAS THE MAN
HE DID NOT SEEK HIM HE SAW HIM HIS EYES WENT THITHER NATURALLY AS
THOUGH THEY HAD KNOWN BEFOREHAND WHERE THAT FIGURE WAS
HE THOUGHT HE WAS LOOKING AT HIMSELF GROWN OLD NOT ABSOLUTELY THE SAME
IN FACE OF COURSE BUT EXACTLY SIMILAR IN ATTITUDE AND ASPECT WITH HIS
BRISTLING HAIR WITH THAT WILD AND UNEASY EYE WITH THAT BLOUSE JUST AS
IT WAS ON THE DAY WHEN HE ENTERED D FULL OF HATRED CONCEALING
HIS SOUL IN THAT HIDEOUS MASS OF FRIGHTFUL THOUGHTS WHICH HE HAD SPENT
NINETEEN YEARS IN COLLECTING ON THE FLOOR OF THE PRISON
HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH A SHUDDER GOOD GOD SHALL I BECOME LIKE THAT
AGAIN
THIS CREATURE SEEMED TO BE AT LEAST SIXTY THERE WAS SOMETHING
INDESCRIBABLY COARSE STUPID AND FRIGHTENED ABOUT HIM
AT THE SOUND MADE BY THE OPENING DOOR PEOPLE HAD DRAWN ASIDE TO MAKE
WAY FOR HIM THE PRESIDENT HAD TURNED HIS HEAD AND UNDERSTANDING THAT
THE PERSONAGE WHO HAD JUST ENTERED WAS THE MAYOR OF M
SUR M HE HAD
BOWED TO HIM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO HAD SEEN M
MADELEINE AT M
SUR M WHITHER THE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE HAD CALLED HIM MORE THAN ONCE
RECOGNIZED HIM AND SALUTED HIM ALSO HE HAD HARDLY PERCEIVED IT HE WAS
THE VICTIM OF A SORT OF HALLUCINATION HE WAS WATCHING
JUDGES CLERKS GENDARMES A THRONG OF CRUELLY CURIOUS HEADS ALL THESE
HE HAD ALREADY BEHELD ONCE IN DAYS GONE BY TWENTY SEVEN YEARS BEFORE
HE HAD ENCOUNTERED THOSE FATAL THINGS ONCE MORE THERE THEY WERE THEY
MOVED THEY EXISTED IT WAS NO LONGER AN EFFORT OF HIS MEMORY A MIRAGE
OF HIS THOUGHT THEY WERE REAL GENDARMES AND REAL JUDGES A REAL
CROWD AND REAL MEN OF FLESH AND BLOOD IT WAS ALL OVER HE BEHELD THE
MONSTROUS ASPECTS OF HIS PAST REAPPEAR AND LIVE ONCE MORE AROUND HIM
WITH ALL THAT THERE IS FORMIDABLE IN REALITY
ALL THIS WAS YAWNING BEFORE HIM
HE WAS HORRIFIED BY IT HE SHUT HIS EYES AND EXCLAIMED IN THE DEEPEST
RECESSES OF HIS SOUL NEVER
AND BY A TRAGIC PLAY OF DESTINY WHICH MADE ALL HIS IDEAS TREMBLE AND
RENDERED HIM NEARLY MAD IT WAS ANOTHER SELF OF HIS THAT WAS THERE ALL
CALLED THAT MAN WHO WAS BEING TRIED JEAN VALJEAN
UNDER HIS VERY EYES UNHEARD OF VISION HE HAD A SORT OF REPRESENTATION
OF THE MOST HORRIBLE MOMENT OF HIS LIFE ENACTED BY HIS SPECTRE
EVERYTHING WAS THERE THE APPARATUS WAS THE SAME THE HOUR OF THE NIGHT
THE FACES OF THE JUDGES OF SOLDIERS AND OF SPECTATORS ALL WERE THE
SAME ONLY ABOVE THE PRESIDENT'S HEAD THERE HUNG A CRUCIFIX SOMETHING
WHICH THE COURTS HAD LACKED AT THE TIME OF HIS CONDEMNATION GOD HAD
BEEN ABSENT WHEN HE HAD BEEN JUDGED
THERE WAS A CHAIR BEHIND HIM HE DROPPED INTO IT TERRIFIED AT THE
THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT BE SEEN WHEN HE WAS SEATED HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF
A PILE OF CARDBOARD BOXES WHICH STOOD ON THE JUDGE'S DESK TO CONCEAL
HIS FACE FROM THE WHOLE ROOM HE COULD NOW SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN HE
HAD FULLY REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE REALITY OF THINGS GRADUALLY HE
RECOVERED HE ATTAINED THAT PHASE OF COMPOSURE WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE TO
LISTEN
M
BAMATABOIS WAS ONE OF THE JURORS
HE LOOKED FOR JAVERT BUT DID NOT SEE HIM THE SEAT OF THE WITNESSES WAS
HIDDEN FROM HIM BY THE CLERK'S TABLE AND THEN AS WE HAVE JUST SAID
THE HALL WAS SPARELY LIGHTED
AT THE MOMENT OF THIS ENTRANCE THE DEFENDANT'S LAWYER HAD JUST FINISHED
HIS PLEA
THE ATTENTION OF ALL WAS EXCITED TO THE HIGHEST PITCH THE AFFAIR HAD
LASTED FOR THREE HOURS FOR THREE HOURS THAT CROWD HAD BEEN WATCHING A
STRANGE MAN A MISERABLE SPECIMEN OF HUMANITY EITHER PROFOUNDLY STUPID
OR PROFOUNDLY SUBTLE GRADUALLY BENDING BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF A TERRIBLE
LIKENESS
THIS MAN AS THE READER ALREADY KNOWS WAS A VAGABOND WHO HAD
BEEN FOUND IN A FIELD CARRYING A BRANCH LADEN WITH RIPE APPLES BROKEN
IN THE ORCHARD OF A NEIGHBOR CALLED THE PIERRON ORCHARD
WHO WAS THIS
MAN AN EXAMINATION HAD BEEN MADE WITNESSES HAD BEEN HEARD AND THEY
WERE UNANIMOUS LIGHT HAD ABOUNDED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DEBATE THE
ACCUSATION SAID WE HAVE IN OUR GRASP NOT ONLY A MARAUDER A STEALER
OF FRUIT WE HAVE HERE IN OUR HANDS A BANDIT AN OLD OFFENDER WHO
HAS BROKEN HIS BAN AN EX CONVICT A MISCREANT OF THE MOST DANGEROUS
DESCRIPTION A MALEFACTOR NAMED JEAN VALJEAN WHOM JUSTICE HAS LONG BEEN
IN SEARCH OF AND WHO EIGHT YEARS AGO ON EMERGING FROM THE GALLEYS
AT TOULON COMMITTED A HIGHWAY ROBBERY ACCOMPANIED BY VIOLENCE ON THE
PERSON OF A CHILD A SAVOYARD NAMED LITTLE GERVAIS A CRIME PROVIDED
FOR BY ARTICLE 383 OF THE PENAL CODE THE RIGHT TO TRY HIM FOR WHICH
WE RESERVE HEREAFTER WHEN HIS IDENTITY SHALL HAVE BEEN JUDICIALLY
ESTABLISHED
HE HAS JUST COMMITTED A FRESH THEFT IT IS A CASE OF A
SECOND OFFENCE CONDEMN HIM FOR THE FRESH DEED LATER ON HE WILL BE
JUDGED FOR THE OLD CRIME IN THE FACE OF THIS ACCUSATION IN THE FACE
OF THE UNANIMITY OF THE WITNESSES THE ACCUSED APPEARED TO BE ASTONISHED
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE MADE SIGNS AND GESTURES WHICH WERE MEANT TO
CONVEY NO OR ELSE HE STARED AT THE CEILING HE SPOKE WITH DIFFICULTY
REPLIED WITH EMBARRASSMENT BUT HIS WHOLE PERSON FROM HEAD TO FOOT WAS
A DENIAL HE WAS AN IDIOT IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THESE MINDS RANGED IN
ORDER OF BATTLE AROUND HIM AND LIKE A STRANGER IN THE MIDST OF THIS
SOCIETY WHICH WAS SEIZING FAST UPON HIM NEVERTHELESS IT WAS A QUESTION
OF THE MOST MENACING FUTURE FOR HIM THE LIKENESS INCREASED EVERY
MOMENT AND THE ENTIRE CROWD SURVEYED WITH MORE ANXIETY THAN HE DID
HIMSELF THAT SENTENCE FREIGHTED WITH CALAMITY WHICH DESCENDED
EVER CLOSER OVER HIS HEAD THERE WAS EVEN A GLIMPSE OF A POSSIBILITY
AFFORDED BESIDES THE GALLEYS A POSSIBLE DEATH PENALTY IN CASE HIS
IDENTITY WERE ESTABLISHED AND THE AFFAIR OF LITTLE GERVAIS WERE TO END
THEREAFTER IN CONDEMNATION
WHO WAS THIS MAN WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF HIS
APATHY WAS IT IMBECILITY OR CRAFT DID HE UNDERSTAND TOO WELL OR DID
HE NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL THESE WERE QUESTIONS WHICH DIVIDED THE CROWD
AND SEEMED TO DIVIDE THE JURY THERE WAS SOMETHING BOTH TERRIBLE AND
PUZZLING IN THIS CASE THE DRAMA WAS NOT ONLY MELANCHOLY IT WAS ALSO
OBSCURE
THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE HAD SPOKEN TOLERABLY WELL IN THAT
PROVINCIAL TONGUE WHICH HAS LONG CONSTITUTED THE ELOQUENCE OF THE BAR
AND WHICH WAS FORMERLY EMPLOYED BY ALL ADVOCATES AT PARIS AS WELL AS AT
ROMORANTIN OR AT MONTBRISON AND WHICH TO DAY HAVING BECOME CLASSIC IS
NO LONGER SPOKEN EXCEPT BY THE OFFICIAL ORATORS OF MAGISTRACY TO WHOM
IT IS SUITED ON ACCOUNT OF ITS GRAVE SONOROUSNESS AND ITS MAJESTIC
STRIDE A TONGUE IN WHICH A HUSBAND IS CALLED A CONSORT AND A WOMAN
A SPOUSE PARIS THE CENTRE OF ART AND CIVILIZATION THE KING
THE MONARCH MONSEIGNEUR THE BISHOP A SAINTED PONTIFF THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY THE ELOQUENT INTERPRETER OF PUBLIC PROSECUTION THE
ARGUMENTS THE ACCENTS WHICH WE HAVE JUST LISTENED TO THE AGE OF LOUIS
XIV THE GRAND AGE A THEATRE THE TEMPLE OF MELPOMENE THE REIGNING
FAMILY THE AUGUST BLOOD OF OUR KINGS A CONCERT A MUSICAL SOLEMNITY
THE GENERAL COMMANDANT OF THE PROVINCE THE ILLUSTRIOUS WARRIOR WHO
ETC THE PUPILS IN THE SEMINARY THESE TENDER LEVITIES ERRORS IMPUTED
TO NEWSPAPERS THE IMPOSTURE WHICH DISTILLS ITS VENOM THROUGH THE
COLUMNS OF THOSE ORGANS ETC
THE LAWYER HAD ACCORDINGLY BEGUN WITH AN
EXPLANATION AS TO THE THEFT OF THE APPLES AN AWKWARD MATTER COUCHED
IN FINE STYLE BUT BENIGNE BOSSUET HIMSELF WAS OBLIGED TO ALLUDE TO A
CHICKEN IN THE MIDST OF A FUNERAL ORATION AND HE EXTRICATED HIMSELF
FROM THE SITUATION IN STATELY FASHION
THE LAWYER ESTABLISHED THE FACT
THAT THE THEFT OF THE APPLES HAD NOT BEEN CIRCUMSTANTIALLY PROVED
HIS CLIENT WHOM HE IN HIS CHARACTER OF COUNSEL PERSISTED IN CALLING
CHAMPMATHIEU HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SCALING THAT WALL NOR BREAKING THAT
BRANCH BY ANY ONE
HE HAD BEEN TAKEN WITH THAT BRANCH WHICH THE LAWYER
PREFERRED TO CALL A BOUGH IN HIS POSSESSION BUT HE SAID THAT HE HAD
FOUND IT BROKEN OFF AND LYING ON THE GROUND AND HAD PICKED IT UP
WHERE WAS THERE ANY PROOF TO THE CONTRARY NO DOUBT THAT BRANCH HAD BEEN
BROKEN OFF AND CONCEALED AFTER THE SCALING OF THE WALL THEN THROWN AWAY
BY THE ALARMED MARAUDER THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THERE HAD BEEN A
THIEF IN THE CASE
BUT WHAT PROOF WAS THERE THAT THAT THIEF HAD BEEN
CHAMPMATHIEU ONE THING ONLY
HIS CHARACTER AS AN EX CONVICT
THE
LAWYER DID NOT DENY THAT THAT CHARACTER APPEARED TO BE UNHAPPILY
WELL ATTESTED THE ACCUSED HAD RESIDED AT FAVEROLLES THE ACCUSED HAD
EXERCISED THE CALLING OF A TREE PRUNER THERE THE NAME OF CHAMPMATHIEU
MIGHT WELL HAVE HAD ITS ORIGIN IN JEAN MATHIEU ALL THAT WAS TRUE IN
SHORT FOUR WITNESSES RECOGNIZE CHAMPMATHIEU POSITIVELY AND WITHOUT
HESITATION AS THAT CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN TO THESE SIGNS TO THIS
TESTIMONY THE COUNSEL COULD OPPOSE NOTHING BUT THE DENIAL OF HIS
CLIENT THE DENIAL OF AN INTERESTED PARTY BUT SUPPOSING THAT HE WAS
THE CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN DID THAT PROVE THAT HE WAS THE THIEF OF THE
APPLES THAT WAS A PRESUMPTION AT THE MOST NOT A PROOF
THE PRISONER
IT WAS TRUE AND HIS COUNSEL IN GOOD FAITH WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT IT
HAD ADOPTED A BAD SYSTEM OF DEFENCE HE OBSTINATELY DENIED EVERYTHING
THE THEFT AND HIS CHARACTER OF CONVICT
AN ADMISSION UPON THIS LAST
POINT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN BETTER AND WOULD HAVE WON FOR HIM THE
INDULGENCE OF HIS JUDGES THE COUNSEL HAD ADVISED HIM TO DO THIS BUT
THE ACCUSED HAD OBSTINATELY REFUSED THINKING NO DOUBT THAT HE WOULD
SAVE EVERYTHING BY ADMITTING NOTHING
IT WAS AN ERROR BUT OUGHT NOT THE
PAUCITY OF THIS INTELLIGENCE TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THIS MAN
WAS VISIBLY STUPID
LONG CONTINUED WRETCHEDNESS IN THE GALLEYS LONG
MISERY OUTSIDE THE GALLEYS HAD BRUTALIZED HIM ETC
HE DEFENDED HIMSELF
BADLY WAS THAT A REASON FOR CONDEMNING HIM AS FOR THE AFFAIR WITH
LITTLE GERVAIS THE COUNSEL NEED NOT DISCUSS IT IT DID NOT ENTER INTO
THE CASE
THE LAWYER WOUND UP BY BESEECHING THE JURY AND THE COURT IF
THE IDENTITY OF JEAN VALJEAN APPEARED TO THEM TO BE EVIDENT TO APPLY
TO HIM THE POLICE PENALTIES WHICH ARE PROVIDED FOR A CRIMINAL WHO HAS
BROKEN HIS BAN AND NOT THE FRIGHTFUL CHASTISEMENT WHICH DESCENDS UPON
THE CONVICT GUILTY OF A SECOND OFFENCE
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY ANSWERED THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE
HE WAS
VIOLENT AND FLORID AS DISTRICT ATTORNEYS USUALLY ARE
HE CONGRATULATED THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE ON HIS LOYALTY AND
SKILFULLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS LOYALTY
HE REACHED THE ACCUSED THROUGH
ALL THE CONCESSIONS MADE BY HIS LAWYER
THE ADVOCATE HAD SEEMED TO ADMIT
THAT THE PRISONER WAS JEAN VALJEAN
HE TOOK NOTE OF THIS
SO THIS MAN
WAS JEAN VALJEAN
THIS POINT HAD BEEN CONCEDED TO THE ACCUSATION AND
COULD NO LONGER BE DISPUTED
HERE BY MEANS OF A CLEVER
AUTONOMASIA WHICH WENT BACK TO THE SOURCES AND CAUSES OF CRIME THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY THUNDERED AGAINST THE IMMORALITY OF THE ROMANTIC
SCHOOL THEN DAWNING UNDER THE NAME OF THE SATANIC SCHOOL WHICH
HAD BEEN BESTOWED UPON IT BY THE CRITICS OF THE QUOTIDIENNE AND THE
ORIFLAMME HE ATTRIBUTED NOT WITHOUT SOME PROBABILITY TO THE INFLUENCE
OF THIS PERVERSE LITERATURE THE CRIME OF CHAMPMATHIEU OR RATHER
TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY OF JEAN VALJEAN
HAVING EXHAUSTED THESE
CONSIDERATIONS HE PASSED ON TO JEAN VALJEAN HIMSELF
WHO WAS THIS JEAN
VALJEAN DESCRIPTION OF JEAN VALJEAN A MONSTER SPEWED FORTH ETC
THE MODEL FOR THIS SORT OF DESCRIPTION IS CONTAINED IN THE TALE OF
THERAMENE WHICH IS NOT USEFUL TO TRAGEDY BUT WHICH EVERY DAY RENDERS
GREAT SERVICES TO JUDICIAL ELOQUENCE
THE AUDIENCE AND THE JURY
SHUDDERED THE DESCRIPTION FINISHED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY RESUMED
WITH AN ORATORICAL TURN CALCULATED TO RAISE THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE
JOURNAL OF THE PREFECTURE TO THE HIGHEST PITCH ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AND
IT IS SUCH A MAN ETC ETC ETC VAGABOND BEGGAR WITHOUT MEANS OF
EXISTENCE ETC ETC INURED BY HIS PAST LIFE TO CULPABLE DEEDS AND
BUT LITTLE REFORMED BY HIS SOJOURN IN THE GALLEYS AS WAS PROVED BY THE
CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST LITTLE GERVAIS ETC ETC IT IS SUCH A MAN
CAUGHT UPON THE HIGHWAY IN THE VERY ACT OF THEFT A FEW PACES FROM A
WALL THAT HAD BEEN SCALED STILL HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE OBJECT
STOLEN WHO DENIES THE CRIME THE THEFT THE CLIMBING THE WALL DENIES
EVERYTHING DENIES EVEN HIS OWN IDENTITY IN ADDITION TO A HUNDRED
OTHER PROOFS TO WHICH WE WILL NOT RECUR FOUR WITNESSES RECOGNIZE
HIM JAVERT THE UPRIGHT INSPECTOR OF POLICE JAVERT AND THREE OF
HIS FORMER COMPANIONS IN INFAMY THE CONVICTS BREVET CHENILDIEU AND
COCHEPAILLE
WHAT DOES HE OFFER IN OPPOSITION TO THIS OVERWHELMING
UNANIMITY HIS DENIAL
WHAT OBDURACY YOU WILL DO JUSTICE GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY ETC ETC
WHILE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS SPEAKING THE
ACCUSED LISTENED TO HIM OPEN MOUTHED WITH A SORT OF AMAZEMENT IN WHICH
SOME ADMIRATION WAS ASSUREDLY BLENDED
HE WAS EVIDENTLY SURPRISED THAT
A MAN COULD TALK LIKE THAT
FROM TIME TO TIME AT THOSE ENERGETIC
MOMENTS OF THE PROSECUTOR'S SPEECH WHEN ELOQUENCE WHICH CANNOT CONTAIN
ITSELF OVERFLOWS IN A FLOOD OF WITHERING EPITHETS AND ENVELOPS THE
ACCUSED LIKE A STORM HE MOVED HIS HEAD SLOWLY FROM RIGHT TO LEFT AND
FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IN THE SORT OF MUTE AND MELANCHOLY PROTEST WITH WHICH
HE HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE ARGUMENT
TWO OR
THREE TIMES THE SPECTATORS WHO WERE NEAREST TO HIM HEARD HIM SAY IN
A LOW VOICE THAT IS WHAT COMES OF NOT HAVING ASKED M
BALOUP THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY DIRECTED THE ATTENTION OF THE JURY TO THIS STUPID
ATTITUDE EVIDENTLY DELIBERATE WHICH DENOTED NOT IMBECILITY BUT CRAFT
SKILL A HABIT OF DECEIVING JUSTICE AND WHICH SET FORTH IN ALL ITS
NAKEDNESS THE PROFOUND PERVERSITY OF THIS MAN
HE ENDED BY MAKING
HIS RESERVES ON THE AFFAIR OF LITTLE GERVAIS AND DEMANDING A SEVERE
SENTENCE
AT THAT TIME AS THE READER WILL REMEMBER IT WAS PENAL SERVITUDE FOR
LIFE
THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE ROSE BEGAN BY COMPLIMENTING MONSIEUR
L'AVOCAT GENERAL ON HIS ADMIRABLE SPEECH THEN REPLIED AS BEST HE
COULD BUT HE WEAKENED THE GROUND WAS EVIDENTLY SLIPPING AWAY FROM
UNDER HIS FEET
CHAPTER X THE SYSTEM OF DENIALS
THE MOMENT FOR CLOSING THE DEBATE HAD ARRIVED
THE PRESIDENT HAD THE
ACCUSED STAND UP AND ADDRESSED TO HIM THE CUSTOMARY QUESTION HAVE YOU
ANYTHING TO ADD TO YOUR DEFENCE
THE MAN DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND AS HE STOOD THERE TWISTING IN HIS
HANDS A TERRIBLE CAP WHICH HE HAD
THE PRESIDENT REPEATED THE QUESTION
THIS TIME THE MAN HEARD IT
HE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND
HE MADE A MOTION
LIKE A MAN WHO IS JUST WAKING UP CAST HIS EYES ABOUT HIM STARED AT
THE AUDIENCE THE GENDARMES HIS COUNSEL THE JURY THE COURT LAID
HIS MONSTROUS FIST ON THE RIM OF WOODWORK IN FRONT OF HIS BENCH
TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AND ALL AT ONCE FIXING HIS GLANCE UPON THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY HE BEGAN TO SPEAK
IT WAS LIKE AN ERUPTION
IT SEEMED FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH THE WORDS ESCAPED FROM HIS
MOUTH INCOHERENT IMPETUOUS PELL MELL TUMBLING OVER EACH OTHER AS
THOUGH THEY WERE ALL PRESSING FORWARD TO ISSUE FORTH AT ONCE
HE SAID
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
THAT I HAVE BEEN A WHEELWRIGHT IN PARIS
AND THAT IT WAS WITH MONSIEUR BALOUP
IT IS A HARD TRADE
IN THE
WHEELWRIGHT'S TRADE ONE WORKS ALWAYS IN THE OPEN AIR IN COURTYARDS
UNDER SHEDS WHEN THE MASTERS ARE GOOD NEVER IN CLOSED WORKSHOPS
BECAUSE SPACE IS REQUIRED YOU SEE
IN WINTER ONE GETS SO COLD THAT ONE
BEATS ONE'S ARMS TOGETHER TO WARM ONE'S SELF BUT THE MASTERS DON'T LIKE
IT THEY SAY IT WASTES TIME
HANDLING IRON WHEN THERE IS ICE BETWEEN
THE PAVING STONES IS HARD WORK
THAT WEARS A MAN OUT QUICKLY
ONE IS OLD
WHILE HE IS STILL QUITE YOUNG IN THAT TRADE
AT FORTY A MAN IS DONE FOR
I WAS FIFTY THREE
I WAS IN A BAD STATE
AND THEN WORKMEN ARE SO MEAN
WHEN A MAN IS NO LONGER YOUNG THEY CALL HIM NOTHING BUT AN OLD BIRD
OLD BEAST I WAS NOT EARNING MORE THAN THIRTY SOUS A DAY
THEY PAID ME
AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
THE MASTERS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY AGE AND THEN I
HAD MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS A LAUNDRESS AT THE RIVER
SHE EARNED A LITTLE
ALSO
IT SUFFICED FOR US TWO
SHE HAD TROUBLE ALSO ALL DAY LONG UP TO
HER WAIST IN A TUB IN RAIN IN SNOW
WHEN THE WIND CUTS YOUR FACE WHEN
IT FREEZES IT IS ALL THE SAME YOU MUST STILL WASH
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE NOT MUCH LINEN AND WAIT UNTIL LATE IF YOU DO NOT WASH YOU
LOSE YOUR CUSTOM
THE PLANKS ARE BADLY JOINED AND WATER DROPS ON YOU
FROM EVERYWHERE YOU HAVE YOUR PETTICOATS ALL DAMP ABOVE AND BELOW
THAT
PENETRATES
SHE HAS ALSO WORKED AT THE LAUNDRY OF THE ENFANTS ROUGES
WHERE THE WATER COMES THROUGH FAUCETS
YOU ARE NOT IN THE TUB THERE YOU
WASH AT THE FAUCET IN FRONT OF YOU AND RINSE IN A BASIN BEHIND YOU
AS
IT IS ENCLOSED YOU ARE NOT SO COLD BUT THERE IS THAT HOT STEAM WHICH
IS TERRIBLE AND WHICH RUINS YOUR EYES
SHE CAME HOME AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
IN THE EVENING AND WENT TO BED AT ONCE SHE WAS SO TIRED
HER HUSBAND
BEAT HER
SHE IS DEAD
WE HAVE NOT BEEN VERY HAPPY
SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL
WHO DID NOT GO TO THE BALL AND WHO WAS VERY PEACEABLE
I REMEMBER
ONE SHROVE TUESDAY WHEN SHE WENT TO BED AT EIGHT O'CLOCK
THERE I AM
TELLING THE TRUTH YOU HAVE ONLY TO ASK
AH YES HOW STUPID I AM PARIS
IS A GULF
WHO KNOWS FATHER CHAMPMATHIEU THERE BUT M
BALOUP DOES I
TELL YOU
GO SEE AT M
BALOUP'S AND AFTER ALL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS
WANTED OF ME
THE MAN CEASED SPEAKING AND REMAINED STANDING
HE HAD SAID THESE THINGS
IN A LOUD RAPID HOARSE VOICE WITH A SORT OF IRRITATED AND SAVAGE
INGENUOUSNESS
ONCE HE PAUSED TO SALUTE SOME ONE IN THE CROWD
THE SORT
OF AFFIRMATIONS WHICH HE SEEMED TO FLING OUT BEFORE HIM AT RANDOM CAME
LIKE HICCOUGHS AND TO EACH HE ADDED THE GESTURE OF A WOOD CUTTER WHO IS
SPLITTING WOOD
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THE AUDIENCE BURST INTO A LAUGH
HE STARED AT THE PUBLIC AND PERCEIVING THAT THEY WERE LAUGHING AND
NOT UNDERSTANDING WHY HE BEGAN TO LAUGH HIMSELF
IT WAS INAUSPICIOUS
THE PRESIDENT AN ATTENTIVE AND BENEVOLENT MAN RAISED HIS VOICE
HE REMINDED THE GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY THAT THE SIEUR BALOUP FORMERLY
A MASTER WHEELWRIGHT WITH WHOM THE ACCUSED STATED THAT HE HAD SERVED
HAD BEEN SUMMONED IN VAIN
HE HAD BECOME BANKRUPT AND WAS NOT TO BE
FOUND THEN TURNING TO THE ACCUSED HE ENJOINED HIM TO LISTEN TO WHAT
HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY AND ADDED YOU ARE IN A POSITION WHERE REFLECTION
IS NECESSARY
THE GRAVEST PRESUMPTIONS REST UPON YOU AND MAY INDUCE
VITAL RESULTS
PRISONER IN YOUR OWN INTERESTS I SUMMON YOU FOR THE
LAST TIME TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF CLEARLY ON TWO POINTS
IN THE FIRST PLACE
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT CLIMB THE WALL OF THE PIERRON ORCHARD BREAK
THE BRANCH AND STEAL THE APPLES THAT IS TO SAY COMMIT THE CRIME
OF BREAKING IN AND THEFT IN THE SECOND PLACE ARE YOU THE DISCHARGED
CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN YES OR NO
THE PRISONER SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A CAPABLE AIR LIKE A MAN WHO HAS
THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ANSWER HE IS GOING TO MAKE
HE
OPENED HIS MOUTH TURNED TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT AND SAID
IN THE FIRST PLACE
THEN HE STARED AT HIS CAP STARED AT THE CEILING AND HELD HIS PEACE
PRISONER SAID THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN A SEVERE VOICE PAY
ATTENTION
YOU ARE NOT ANSWERING ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN ASKED OF YOU
YOUR EMBARRASSMENT CONDEMNS YOU
IT IS EVIDENT THAT YOUR NAME IS NOT
CHAMPMATHIEU THAT YOU ARE THE CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN CONCEALED FIRST
UNDER THE NAME OF JEAN MATHIEU WHICH WAS THE NAME OF HIS MOTHER THAT
YOU WENT TO AUVERGNE THAT YOU WERE BORN AT FAVEROLLES WHERE YOU WERE
A PRUNER OF TREES
IT IS EVIDENT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF ENTERING
AND OF THE THEFT OF RIPE APPLES FROM THE PIERRON ORCHARD
THE GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY WILL FORM THEIR OWN OPINION
ILLUSTRATION FATHER CHAMPMATHIEU ON TRIAL
THE PRISONER HAD FINALLY RESUMED HIS SEAT HE AROSE ABRUPTLY WHEN THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAD FINISHED AND EXCLAIMED
YOU ARE VERY WICKED THAT YOU ARE THIS WHAT I WANTED TO SAY I COULD
NOT FIND WORDS FOR IT AT FIRST
I HAVE STOLEN NOTHING
I AM A MAN WHO
DOES NOT HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT EVERY DAY
I WAS COMING FROM AILLY I
WAS WALKING THROUGH THE COUNTRY AFTER A SHOWER WHICH HAD MADE THE WHOLE
COUNTRY YELLOW EVEN THE PONDS WERE OVERFLOWED AND NOTHING SPRANG FROM
THE SAND ANY MORE BUT THE LITTLE BLADES OF GRASS AT THE WAYSIDE
I
FOUND A BROKEN BRANCH WITH APPLES ON THE GROUND I PICKED UP THE BRANCH
WITHOUT KNOWING THAT IT WOULD GET ME INTO TROUBLE
I HAVE BEEN IN
PRISON AND THEY HAVE BEEN DRAGGING ME ABOUT FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS
MORE THAN THAT I CANNOT SAY PEOPLE TALK AGAINST ME THEY TELL ME
'ANSWER THE GENDARME WHO IS A GOOD FELLOW NUDGES MY ELBOW AND SAYS
TO ME IN A LOW VOICE 'COME ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN I
HAVE NO EDUCATION I AM A POOR MAN THAT IS WHERE THEY WRONG ME BECAUSE
THEY DO NOT SEE THIS
I HAVE NOT STOLEN I PICKED UP FROM THE GROUND
THINGS THAT WERE LYING THERE
YOU SAY JEAN VALJEAN JEAN MATHIEU I
DON'T KNOW THOSE PERSONS THEY ARE VILLAGERS
I WORKED FOR M
BALOUP
BOULEVARD DE L'HOPITAL MY NAME IS CHAMPMATHIEU
YOU ARE VERY CLEVER TO
TELL ME WHERE I WAS BORN I DON'T KNOW MYSELF IT'S NOT EVERYBODY
WHO HAS A HOUSE IN WHICH TO COME INTO THE WORLD THAT WOULD BE TOO
CONVENIENT
I THINK THAT MY FATHER AND MOTHER WERE PEOPLE WHO STROLLED
ALONG THE HIGHWAYS I KNOW NOTHING DIFFERENT
WHEN I WAS A CHILD
THEY CALLED ME YOUNG FELLOW NOW THEY CALL ME OLD FELLOW THOSE ARE MY
BAPTISMAL NAMES TAKE THAT AS YOU LIKE
I HAVE BEEN IN AUVERGNE I HAVE
BEEN AT FAVEROLLES
PARDI
WELL CAN'T A MAN HAVE BEEN IN AUVERGNE OR
AT FAVEROLLES WITHOUT HAVING BEEN IN THE GALLEYS I TELL YOU THAT I
HAVE NOT STOLEN AND THAT I AM FATHER CHAMPMATHIEU I HAVE BEEN WITH M
BALOUP I HAVE HAD A SETTLED RESIDENCE
YOU WORRY ME WITH YOUR NONSENSE
THERE WHY IS EVERYBODY PURSUING ME SO FURIOUSLY
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAD REMAINED STANDING HE ADDRESSED THE
PRESIDENT
MONSIEUR LE PRESIDENT IN VIEW OF THE CONFUSED BUT EXCEEDINGLY CLEVER
DENIALS OF THE PRISONER WHO WOULD LIKE TO PASS HIMSELF OFF AS AN IDIOT
BUT WHO WILL NOT SUCCEED IN SO DOING WE SHALL ATTEND TO THAT WE
DEMAND THAT IT SHALL PLEASE YOU AND THAT IT SHALL PLEASE THE COURT TO
SUMMON ONCE MORE INTO THIS PLACE THE CONVICTS BREVET COCHEPAILLE AND
CHENILDIEU AND POLICE INSPECTOR JAVERT AND QUESTION THEM FOR THE LAST
TIME AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE PRISONER WITH THE CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN
I WOULD REMIND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID THE PRESIDENT THAT
POLICE INSPECTOR JAVERT RECALLED BY HIS DUTIES TO THE CAPITAL OF A
NEIGHBORING ARRONDISSEMENT LEFT THE COURT ROOM AND THE TOWN AS SOON AS
HE HAD MADE HIS DEPOSITION WE HAVE ACCORDED HIM PERMISSION WITH THE
CONSENT OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND OF THE COUNSEL FOR THE PRISONER
THAT IS TRUE MR
PRESIDENT RESPONDED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
IN THE
ABSENCE OF SIEUR JAVERT I THINK IT MY DUTY TO REMIND THE GENTLEMEN OF
THE JURY OF WHAT HE SAID HERE A FEW HOURS AGO
JAVERT IS AN ESTIMABLE
MAN WHO DOES HONOR BY HIS RIGOROUS AND STRICT PROBITY TO INFERIOR BUT
IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
THESE ARE THE TERMS OF HIS DEPOSITION 'I DO NOT
EVEN STAND IN NEED OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL PROOFS AND MORAL PRESUMPTIONS TO
GIVE THE LIE TO THE PRISONER'S DENIAL
I RECOGNIZE HIM PERFECTLY
THE
NAME OF THIS MAN IS NOT CHAMPMATHIEU HE IS AN EX CONVICT NAMED JEAN
VALJEAN AND IS VERY VICIOUS AND MUCH TO BE FEARED
IT IS ONLY WITH
EXTREME REGRET THAT HE WAS RELEASED AT THE EXPIRATION OF HIS TERM
HE
UNDERWENT NINETEEN YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE FOR THEFT
HE MADE FIVE OR
SIX ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE
BESIDES THE THEFT FROM LITTLE GERVAIS AND FROM
THE PIERRON ORCHARD I SUSPECT HIM OF A THEFT COMMITTED IN THE HOUSE OF
HIS GRACE THE LATE BISHOP OF D I OFTEN SAW HIM AT THE TIME WHEN I
WAS ADJUTANT OF THE GALLEY GUARD AT THE PRISON IN TOULON
I REPEAT THAT
I RECOGNIZE HIM PERFECTLY
THIS EXTREMELY PRECISE STATEMENT APPEARED TO PRODUCE A VIVID IMPRESSION
ON THE PUBLIC AND ON THE JURY
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY CONCLUDED BY
INSISTING THAT IN DEFAULT OF JAVERT THE THREE WITNESSES BREVET
CHENILDIEU AND COCHEPAILLE SHOULD BE HEARD ONCE MORE AND SOLEMNLY
INTERROGATED
THE PRESIDENT TRANSMITTED THE ORDER TO AN USHER AND A MOMENT LATER
THE DOOR OF THE WITNESSES' ROOM OPENED
THE USHER ACCOMPANIED BY A
GENDARME READY TO LEND HIM ARMED ASSISTANCE INTRODUCED THE CONVICT
BREVET
THE AUDIENCE WAS IN SUSPENSE AND ALL BREASTS HEAVED AS THOUGH
THEY HAD CONTAINED BUT ONE SOUL
THE EX CONVICT BREVET WORE THE BLACK AND GRAY WAISTCOAT OF THE CENTRAL
PRISONS
BREVET WAS A PERSON SIXTY YEARS OF AGE WHO HAD A SORT OF
BUSINESS MAN'S FACE AND THE AIR OF A RASCAL
THE TWO SOMETIMES GO
TOGETHER
IN PRISON WHITHER FRESH MISDEEDS HAD LED HIM HE HAD BECOME
SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF A TURNKEY
HE WAS A MAN OF WHOM HIS SUPERIORS
SAID HE TRIES TO MAKE HIMSELF OF USE THE CHAPLAINS BORE GOOD
TESTIMONY AS TO HIS RELIGIOUS HABITS
IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THIS
PASSED UNDER THE RESTORATION
BREVET SAID THE PRESIDENT YOU HAVE UNDERGONE AN IGNOMINIOUS
SENTENCE AND YOU CANNOT TAKE AN OATH
BREVET DROPPED HIS EYES
NEVERTHELESS CONTINUED THE PRESIDENT EVEN IN THE MAN WHOM THE LAW
HAS DEGRADED THERE MAY REMAIN WHEN THE DIVINE MERCY PERMITS IT A
SENTIMENT OF HONOR AND OF EQUITY
IT IS TO THIS SENTIMENT THAT I
APPEAL AT THIS DECISIVE HOUR
IF IT STILL EXISTS IN YOU AND I HOPE
IT DOES REFLECT BEFORE REPLYING TO ME CONSIDER ON THE ONE HAND THIS
MAN WHOM A WORD FROM YOU MAY RUIN ON THE OTHER HAND JUSTICE WHICH A
WORD FROM YOU MAY ENLIGHTEN
THE INSTANT IS SOLEMN THERE IS STILL TIME
TO RETRACT IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
RISE PRISONER
BREVET
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THE ACCUSED RECALL YOUR SOUVENIRS AND TELL US ON
YOUR SOUL AND CONSCIENCE IF YOU PERSIST IN RECOGNIZING THIS MAN AS YOUR
FORMER COMPANION IN THE GALLEYS JEAN VALJEAN
BREVET LOOKED AT THE PRISONER THEN TURNED TOWARDS THE COURT
YES MR
PRESIDENT I WAS THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE HIM AND I STICK TO
IT THAT MAN IS JEAN VALJEAN WHO ENTERED AT TOULON IN 1796 AND LEFT IN
1815
I LEFT A YEAR LATER
HE HAS THE AIR OF A BRUTE NOW BUT IT MUST BE
BECAUSE AGE HAS BRUTALIZED HIM HE WAS SLY AT THE GALLEYS I RECOGNIZE
HIM POSITIVELY
TAKE YOUR SEAT SAID THE PRESIDENT
PRISONER REMAIN STANDING
CHENILDIEU WAS BROUGHT IN A PRISONER FOR LIFE AS WAS INDICATED BY HIS
RED CASSOCK AND HIS GREEN CAP
HE WAS SERVING OUT HIS SENTENCE AT THE
GALLEYS OF TOULON WHENCE HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT FOR THIS CASE
HE WAS A
SMALL MAN OF ABOUT FIFTY BRISK WRINKLED FRAIL YELLOW BRAZEN FACED
FEVERISH WHO HAD A SORT OF SICKLY FEEBLENESS ABOUT ALL HIS LIMBS AND
HIS WHOLE PERSON AND AN IMMENSE FORCE IN HIS GLANCE
HIS COMPANIONS IN
THE GALLEYS HAD NICKNAMED HIM I DENY GOD JE NIE DIEU CHENILDIEU
THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED HIM IN NEARLY THE SAME WORDS WHICH HE HAD
USED TO BREVET
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE REMINDED HIM OF HIS INFAMY WHICH
DEPRIVED HIM OF THE RIGHT TO TAKE AN OATH CHENILDIEU RAISED HIS
HEAD AND LOOKED THE CROWD IN THE FACE
THE PRESIDENT INVITED HIM TO
REFLECTION AND ASKED HIM AS HE HAD ASKED BREVET IF HE PERSISTED IN
RECOGNITION OF THE PRISONER
CHENILDIEU BURST OUT LAUGHING
PARDIEU AS IF I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM WE WERE ATTACHED TO THE SAME
CHAIN FOR FIVE YEARS
SO YOU ARE SULKING OLD FELLOW
GO TAKE YOUR SEAT SAID THE PRESIDENT
THE USHER BROUGHT IN COCHEPAILLE
HE WAS ANOTHER CONVICT FOR LIFE WHO
HAD COME FROM THE GALLEYS AND WAS DRESSED IN RED LIKE CHENILDIEU WAS
A PEASANT FROM LOURDES AND A HALF BEAR OF THE PYRENEES
HE HAD GUARDED
THE FLOCKS AMONG THE MOUNTAINS AND FROM A SHEPHERD HE HAD SLIPPED INTO
A BRIGAND
COCHEPAILLE WAS NO LESS SAVAGE AND SEEMED EVEN MORE STUPID
THAN THE PRISONER
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WRETCHED MEN WHOM NATURE HAS
SKETCHED OUT FOR WILD BEASTS AND ON WHOM SOCIETY PUTS THE FINISHING
TOUCHES AS CONVICTS IN THE GALLEYS
THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO TOUCH HIM WITH SOME GRAVE AND PATHETIC WORDS
AND ASKED HIM AS HE HAD ASKED THE OTHER TWO IF HE PERSISTED WITHOUT
HESITATION OR TROUBLE IN RECOGNIZING THE MAN WHO WAS STANDING BEFORE
HIM
HE IS JEAN VALJEAN SAID COCHEPAILLE
HE WAS EVEN CALLED
JEAN THE SCREW BECAUSE HE WAS SO STRONG
EACH OF THESE AFFIRMATIONS FROM THESE THREE MEN EVIDENTLY SINCERE AND
IN GOOD FAITH HAD RAISED IN THE AUDIENCE A MURMUR OF BAD AUGURY FOR THE
PRISONER A MURMUR WHICH INCREASED AND LASTED LONGER EACH TIME THAT A
FRESH DECLARATION WAS ADDED TO THE PROCEEDING
THE PRISONER HAD LISTENED TO THEM WITH THAT ASTOUNDED FACE WHICH WAS
ACCORDING TO THE ACCUSATION HIS PRINCIPAL MEANS OF DEFENCE AT THE
FIRST THE GENDARMES HIS NEIGHBORS HAD HEARD HIM MUTTER BETWEEN HIS
TEETH AH WELL HE'S A NICE ONE AFTER THE SECOND HE SAID A LITTLE
LOUDER WITH AN AIR THAT WAS ALMOST THAT OF SATISFACTION GOOD AT THE
THIRD HE CRIED FAMOUS
THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED HIM
HAVE YOU HEARD PRISONER WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY
HE REPLIED
I SAY 'FAMOUS
AN UPROAR BROKE OUT AMONG THE AUDIENCE AND WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE
JURY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE MAN WAS LOST
USHERS SAID THE PRESIDENT ENFORCE SILENCE I AM GOING TO SUM UP THE
ARGUMENTS
AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A MOVEMENT JUST BESIDE THE PRESIDENT A VOICE
WAS HEARD CRYING
BREVET CHENILDIEU COCHEPAILLE LOOK HERE
ALL WHO HEARD THAT VOICE WERE CHILLED SO LAMENTABLE AND TERRIBLE WAS
IT ALL EYES WERE TURNED TO THE POINT WHENCE IT HAD PROCEEDED
A MAN
PLACED AMONG THE PRIVILEGED SPECTATORS WHO WERE SEATED BEHIND THE
COURT HAD JUST RISEN HAD PUSHED OPEN THE HALF DOOR WHICH SEPARATED THE
TRIBUNAL FROM THE AUDIENCE AND WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL
THE PRESIDENT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY M
BAMATABOIS TWENTY PERSONS
RECOGNIZED HIM AND EXCLAIMED IN CONCERT
M
MADELEINE
CHAPTER XI CHAMPMATHIEU MORE AND MORE ASTONISHED
IT WAS HE IN FACT
THE CLERK'S LAMP ILLUMINED HIS COUNTENANCE
HE HELD
HIS HAT IN HIS HAND THERE WAS NO DISORDER IN HIS CLOTHING HIS COAT
WAS CAREFULLY BUTTONED HE WAS VERY PALE AND HE TREMBLED SLIGHTLY
HIS HAIR WHICH HAD STILL BEEN GRAY ON HIS ARRIVAL IN ARRAS WAS NOW
ENTIRELY WHITE IT HAD TURNED WHITE DURING THE HOUR HE HAD SAT THERE
ALL HEADS WERE RAISED THE SENSATION WAS INDESCRIBABLE THERE WAS
A MOMENTARY HESITATION IN THE AUDIENCE THE VOICE HAD BEEN SO
HEART RENDING THE MAN WHO STOOD THERE APPEARED SO CALM THAT THEY DID
NOT UNDERSTAND AT FIRST
THEY ASKED THEMSELVES WHETHER HE HAD INDEED
UTTERED THAT CRY THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT TRANQUIL MAN HAD BEEN
THE ONE TO GIVE THAT TERRIBLE OUTCRY
THIS INDECISION ONLY LASTED A FEW SECONDS
EVEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT
AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY COULD UTTER A WORD BEFORE THE USHERS AND THE
GENDARMES COULD MAKE A GESTURE THE MAN WHOM ALL STILL CALLED AT THAT
MOMENT M
MADELEINE HAD ADVANCED TOWARDS THE WITNESSES COCHEPAILLE
BREVET AND CHENILDIEU
DO YOU NOT RECOGNIZE ME SAID HE
ALL THREE REMAINED SPEECHLESS AND INDICATED BY A SIGN OF THE HEAD THAT
THEY DID NOT KNOW HIM
COCHEPAILLE WHO WAS INTIMIDATED MADE A MILITARY
SALUTE
M
MADELEINE TURNED TOWARDS THE JURY AND THE COURT AND SAID IN
A GENTLE VOICE
GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY ORDER THE PRISONER TO BE RELEASED MR
PRESIDENT HAVE ME ARRESTED
HE IS NOT THE MAN WHOM YOU ARE IN SEARCH
OF IT IS I I AM JEAN VALJEAN
NOT A MOUTH BREATHED THE FIRST COMMOTION OF ASTONISHMENT HAD BEEN
FOLLOWED BY A SILENCE LIKE THAT OF THE GRAVE THOSE WITHIN THE HALL
EXPERIENCED THAT SORT OF RELIGIOUS TERROR WHICH SEIZES THE MASSES WHEN
SOMETHING GRAND HAS BEEN DONE
IN THE MEANTIME THE FACE OF THE PRESIDENT WAS STAMPED WITH SYMPATHY AND
SADNESS HE HAD EXCHANGED A RAPID SIGN WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND A
FEW LOW TONED WORDS WITH THE ASSISTANT JUDGES HE ADDRESSED THE PUBLIC
AND ASKED IN ACCENTS WHICH ALL UNDERSTOOD
IS THERE A PHYSICIAN PRESENT
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TOOK THE WORD
GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY THE VERY STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED INCIDENT
WHICH DISTURBS THE AUDIENCE INSPIRES US LIKE YOURSELVES ONLY WITH A
SENTIMENT WHICH IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR US TO EXPRESS
YOU ALL KNOW BY
REPUTATION AT LEAST THE HONORABLE M
MADELEINE MAYOR OF M
SUR M
IF THERE IS A PHYSICIAN IN THE AUDIENCE WE JOIN THE PRESIDENT IN
REQUESTING HIM TO ATTEND TO M
MADELEINE AND TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS
HOME
M
MADELEINE DID NOT ALLOW THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO FINISH HE
INTERRUPTED HIM IN ACCENTS FULL OF SUAVITY AND AUTHORITY
THESE ARE THE
WORDS WHICH HE UTTERED HERE THEY ARE LITERALLY AS THEY WERE WRITTEN
DOWN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TRIAL BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES TO THIS SCENE
AND AS THEY NOW RING IN THE EARS OF THOSE WHO HEARD THEM NEARLY FORTY
YEARS AGO
I THANK YOU MR
DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUT I AM NOT MAD YOU SHALL SEE
YOU WERE ON THE POINT OF COMMITTING A GREAT ERROR RELEASE THIS MAN I
AM FULFILLING A DUTY I AM THAT MISERABLE CRIMINAL
I AM THE ONLY ONE
HERE WHO SEES THE MATTER CLEARLY AND I AM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH
GOD
WHO IS ON HIGH LOOKS DOWN ON WHAT I AM DOING AT THIS MOMENT AND THAT
SUFFICES
YOU CAN TAKE ME FOR HERE I AM BUT I HAVE DONE MY BEST I
CONCEALED MYSELF UNDER ANOTHER NAME I HAVE BECOME RICH I HAVE BECOME
A MAYOR I HAVE TRIED TO RE ENTER THE RANKS OF THE HONEST
IT SEEMS THAT
THAT IS NOT TO BE DONE
IN SHORT THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH I CANNOT
TELL
I WILL NOT NARRATE THE STORY OF MY LIFE TO YOU YOU WILL HEAR IT
ONE OF THESE DAYS
I ROBBED MONSEIGNEUR THE BISHOP IT IS TRUE IT IS
TRUE THAT I ROBBED LITTLE GERVAIS THEY WERE RIGHT IN TELLING YOU THAT
JEAN VALJEAN WAS A VERY VICIOUS WRETCH
PERHAPS IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER
HIS FAULT
LISTEN HONORABLE JUDGES A MAN WHO HAS BEEN SO GREATLY
HUMBLED AS I HAVE HAS NEITHER ANY REMONSTRANCES TO MAKE TO PROVIDENCE
NOR ANY ADVICE TO GIVE TO SOCIETY BUT YOU SEE THE INFAMY FROM WHICH I
HAVE TRIED TO ESCAPE IS AN INJURIOUS THING THE GALLEYS MAKE THE CONVICT
WHAT HE IS REFLECT UPON THAT IF YOU PLEASE
BEFORE GOING TO THE
GALLEYS I WAS A POOR PEASANT WITH VERY LITTLE INTELLIGENCE A SORT
OF IDIOT THE GALLEYS WROUGHT A CHANGE IN ME
I WAS STUPID I BECAME
VICIOUS I WAS A BLOCK OF WOOD I BECAME A FIREBRAND
LATER ON
INDULGENCE AND KINDNESS SAVED ME AS SEVERITY HAD RUINED ME
BUT PARDON
ME YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING
YOU WILL FIND AT MY HOUSE
AMONG THE ASHES IN THE FIREPLACE THE FORTY SOU PIECE WHICH I STOLE
SEVEN YEARS AGO FROM LITTLE GERVAIS

MADELEINE HAS GONE MAD YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME THAT IS DISTRESSING
DO
NOT AT LEAST CONDEMN THIS MAN WHAT THESE MEN DO NOT RECOGNIZE ME I
WISH JAVERT WERE HERE HE WOULD RECOGNIZE ME
NOTHING CAN REPRODUCE THE SOMBRE AND KINDLY MELANCHOLY OF TONE WHICH
ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS
HE TURNED TO THE THREE CONVICTS AND SAID
WELL I RECOGNIZE YOU DO YOU REMEMBER BREVET
HE PAUSED HESITATED FOR AN INSTANT AND SAID
DO YOU REMEMBER THE KNITTED SUSPENDERS WITH A CHECKED PATTERN WHICH YOU
WORE IN THE GALLEYS
BREVET GAVE A START OF SURPRISE AND SURVEYED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH
A FRIGHTENED AIR
HE CONTINUED
CHENILDIEU YOU WHO CONFERRED ON YOURSELF THE NAME OF 'JENIE DIEU
YOUR WHOLE RIGHT SHOULDER BEARS A DEEP BURN BECAUSE YOU ONE DAY LAID
YOUR SHOULDER AGAINST THE CHAFING DISH FULL OF COALS IN ORDER TO EFFACE
THE THREE LETTERS T
F
P WHICH ARE STILL VISIBLE NEVERTHELESS
ANSWER IS THIS TRUE
IT IS TRUE SAID CHENILDIEU
HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO COCHEPAILLE
COCHEPAILLE YOU HAVE NEAR THE BEND IN YOUR LEFT ARM A DATE STAMPED
IN BLUE LETTERS WITH BURNT POWDER THE DATE IS THAT OF THE LANDING OF
THE EMPEROR AT CANNES MARCH 1 1815 PULL UP YOUR SLEEVE
COCHEPAILLE PUSHED UP HIS SLEEVE ALL EYES WERE FOCUSED ON HIM AND ON
HIS BARE ARM
A GENDARME HELD A LIGHT CLOSE TO IT THERE WAS THE DATE
THE UNHAPPY MAN TURNED TO THE SPECTATORS AND THE JUDGES WITH A SMILE
WHICH STILL RENDS THE HEARTS OF ALL WHO SAW IT WHENEVER THEY THINK OF
IT
IT WAS A SMILE OF TRIUMPH IT WAS ALSO A SMILE OF DESPAIR
YOU SEE PLAINLY HE SAID THAT I AM JEAN VALJEAN
IN THAT CHAMBER THERE WERE NO LONGER EITHER JUDGES ACCUSERS NOR
GENDARMES THERE WAS NOTHING BUT STARING EYES AND SYMPATHIZING HEARTS
NO ONE RECALLED ANY LONGER THE PART THAT EACH MIGHT BE CALLED UPON
TO PLAY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FORGOT HE WAS THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF
PROSECUTING THE PRESIDENT THAT HE WAS THERE TO PRESIDE THE COUNSEL FOR
THE DEFENCE THAT HE WAS THERE TO DEFEND
IT WAS A STRIKING CIRCUMSTANCE
THAT NO QUESTION WAS PUT THAT NO AUTHORITY INTERVENED
THE PECULIARITY
OF SUBLIME SPECTACLES IS THAT THEY CAPTURE ALL SOULS AND TURN WITNESSES
INTO SPECTATORS
NO ONE PROBABLY COULD HAVE EXPLAINED WHAT HE FELT
NO ONE PROBABLY SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS WITNESSING THE SPLENDID
OUTBURST OF A GRAND LIGHT ALL FELT THEMSELVES INWARDLY DAZZLED
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY HAD JEAN VALJEAN BEFORE THEIR EYES
THAT WAS
CLEAR
THE APPEARANCE OF THIS MAN HAD SUFFICED TO SUFFUSE WITH LIGHT
THAT MATTER WHICH HAD BEEN SO OBSCURE BUT A MOMENT PREVIOUSLY WITHOUT
ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION THE WHOLE CROWD AS BY A SORT OF ELECTRIC
REVELATION UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY AND AT A SINGLE GLANCE THE SIMPLE
AND MAGNIFICENT HISTORY OF A MAN WHO WAS DELIVERING HIMSELF UP SO
THAT ANOTHER MAN MIGHT NOT BE CONDEMNED IN HIS STEAD
THE DETAILS THE
HESITATIONS LITTLE POSSIBLE OPPOSITIONS WERE SWALLOWED UP IN THAT VAST
AND LUMINOUS FACT
IT WAS AN IMPRESSION WHICH VANISHED SPEEDILY BUT WHICH WAS IRRESISTIBLE
AT THE MOMENT
I DO NOT WISH TO DISTURB THE COURT FURTHER RESUMED JEAN VALJEAN
I
SHALL WITHDRAW SINCE YOU DO NOT ARREST ME
I HAVE MANY THINGS TO DO
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY KNOWS WHO I AM HE KNOWS WHITHER I AM GOING HE
CAN HAVE ME ARRESTED WHEN HE LIKES
HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR
NOT A VOICE WAS RAISED NOT AN
ARM EXTENDED TO HINDER HIM
ALL STOOD ASIDE
AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS
ABOUT HIM THAT DIVINE SOMETHING WHICH CAUSES MULTITUDES TO STAND ASIDE
AND MAKE WAY FOR A MAN
HE TRAVERSED THE CROWD SLOWLY
IT WAS NEVER
KNOWN WHO OPENED THE DOOR BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE FOUND THE DOOR OPEN
WHEN HE REACHED IT
ON ARRIVING THERE HE TURNED ROUND AND SAID
I AM AT YOUR COMMAND MR
DISTRICT ATTORNEY
THEN HE ADDRESSED THE AUDIENCE
ALL OF YOU ALL WHO ARE PRESENT CONSIDER ME WORTHY OF PITY DO YOU
NOT GOOD GOD WHEN I THINK OF WHAT I WAS ON THE POINT OF DOING I
CONSIDER THAT I AM TO BE ENVIED
NEVERTHELESS I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED
NOT TO HAVE HAD THIS OCCUR
HE WITHDREW AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM AS IT HAD OPENED FOR THOSE
WHO DO CERTAIN SOVEREIGN THINGS ARE ALWAYS SURE OF BEING SERVED BY SOME
ONE IN THE CROWD
LESS THAN AN HOUR AFTER THIS THE VERDICT OF THE JURY FREED THE SAID
CHAMPMATHIEU FROM ALL ACCUSATIONS AND CHAMPMATHIEU BEING AT ONCE
RELEASED WENT OFF IN A STATE OF STUPEFACTION THINKING THAT ALL MEN
WERE FOOLS AND COMPREHENDING NOTHING OF THIS VISION
BOOK EIGHTH A COUNTER BLOW
CHAPTER I IN WHAT MIRROR M
MADELEINE CONTEMPLATES HIS HAIR
THE DAY HAD BEGUN TO DAWN
FANTINE HAD PASSED A SLEEPLESS AND FEVERISH
NIGHT FILLED WITH HAPPY VISIONS AT DAYBREAK SHE FELL ASLEEP
SISTER
SIMPLICE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING WITH HER AVAILED HERSELF OF THIS
SLUMBER TO GO AND PREPARE A NEW POTION OF CHINCHONA
THE WORTHY SISTER
HAD BEEN IN THE LABORATORY OF THE INFIRMARY BUT A FEW MOMENTS BENDING
OVER HER DRUGS AND PHIALS AND SCRUTINIZING THINGS VERY CLOSELY ON
ACCOUNT OF THE DIMNESS WHICH THE HALF LIGHT OF DAWN SPREADS OVER ALL
OBJECTS
SUDDENLY SHE RAISED HER HEAD AND UTTERED A FAINT SHRIEK
M
MADELEINE STOOD BEFORE HER HE HAD JUST ENTERED SILENTLY
IS IT YOU MR
MAYOR SHE EXCLAIMED
HE REPLIED IN A LOW VOICE
HOW IS THAT POOR WOMAN
NOT SO BAD JUST NOW BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY UNEASY
SHE EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT HAD PASSED THAT FANTINE HAD BEEN VERY ILL THE
DAY BEFORE AND THAT SHE WAS BETTER NOW BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT THAT THE
MAYOR HAD GONE TO MONTFERMEIL TO GET HER CHILD
THE SISTER DARED NOT
QUESTION THE MAYOR BUT SHE PERCEIVED PLAINLY FROM HIS AIR THAT HE HAD
NOT COME FROM THERE
ALL THAT IS GOOD SAID HE YOU WERE RIGHT NOT TO UNDECEIVE HER
YES RESPONDED THE SISTER BUT NOW MR
MAYOR SHE WILL SEE YOU AND
WILL NOT SEE HER CHILD
WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO HER
HE REFLECTED FOR A MOMENT
GOD WILL INSPIRE US SAID HE
BUT WE CANNOT TELL A LIE MURMURED THE SISTER HALF ALOUD
IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT IN THE ROOM
THE LIGHT FELL FULL ON M
MADELEINE'S
FACE
THE SISTER CHANCED TO RAISE HER EYES TO IT
GOOD GOD SIR SHE EXCLAIMED WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU YOUR HAIR IS
PERFECTLY WHITE
WHITE SAID HE
SISTER SIMPLICE HAD NO MIRROR
SHE RUMMAGED IN A DRAWER AND PULLED OUT
THE LITTLE GLASS WHICH THE DOCTOR OF THE INFIRMARY USED TO SEE WHETHER
A PATIENT WAS DEAD AND WHETHER HE NO LONGER BREATHED
M
MADELEINE TOOK
THE MIRROR LOOKED AT HIS HAIR AND SAID
WELL
HE UTTERED THE WORD INDIFFERENTLY AND AS THOUGH HIS MIND WERE ON
SOMETHING ELSE
THE SISTER FELT CHILLED BY SOMETHING STRANGE OF WHICH SHE CAUGHT A
GLIMPSE IN ALL THIS
HE INQUIRED
CAN I SEE HER
IS NOT MONSIEUR LE MAIRE GOING TO HAVE HER CHILD BROUGHT BACK TO HER
SAID THE SISTER HARDLY VENTURING TO PUT THE QUESTION
OF COURSE BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE DAYS AT LEAST
IF SHE WERE NOT TO SEE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE UNTIL THAT TIME WENT ON
THE SISTER TIMIDLY SHE WOULD NOT KNOW THAT MONSIEUR LE MAIRE HAD
RETURNED AND IT WOULD BE EASY TO INSPIRE HER WITH PATIENCE AND WHEN
THE CHILD ARRIVED SHE WOULD NATURALLY THINK MONSIEUR LE MAIRE HAD JUST
COME WITH THE CHILD
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ENACT A LIE
M
MADELEINE SEEMED TO REFLECT FOR A FEW MOMENTS THEN HE SAID WITH HIS
CALM GRAVITY
NO SISTER I MUST SEE HER
I MAY PERHAPS BE IN HASTE
THE NUN DID NOT APPEAR TO NOTICE THIS WORD PERHAPS WHICH COMMUNICATED
AN OBSCURE AND SINGULAR SENSE TO THE WORDS OF THE MAYOR'S SPEECH
SHE
REPLIED LOWERING HER EYES AND HER VOICE RESPECTFULLY
IN THAT CASE SHE IS ASLEEP BUT MONSIEUR LE MAIRE MAY ENTER
HE MADE SOME REMARKS ABOUT A DOOR WHICH SHUT BADLY AND THE NOISE OF
WHICH MIGHT AWAKEN THE SICK WOMAN THEN HE ENTERED FANTINE'S CHAMBER
APPROACHED THE BED AND DREW ASIDE THE CURTAINS
SHE WAS ASLEEP
HER
BREATH ISSUED FROM HER BREAST WITH THAT TRAGIC SOUND WHICH IS PECULIAR
TO THOSE MALADIES AND WHICH BREAKS THE HEARTS OF MOTHERS WHEN THEY ARE
WATCHING THROUGH THE NIGHT BESIDE THEIR SLEEPING CHILD WHO IS CONDEMNED
TO DEATH
BUT THIS PAINFUL RESPIRATION HARDLY TROUBLED A SORT OF
INEFFABLE SERENITY WHICH OVERSPREAD HER COUNTENANCE AND WHICH
TRANSFIGURED HER IN HER SLEEP
HER PALLOR HAD BECOME WHITENESS HER
CHEEKS WERE CRIMSON HER LONG GOLDEN LASHES THE ONLY BEAUTY OF HER
YOUTH AND HER VIRGINITY WHICH REMAINED TO HER PALPITATED THOUGH THEY
REMAINED CLOSED AND DROOPING
HER WHOLE PERSON WAS TREMBLING WITH AN
INDESCRIBABLE UNFOLDING OF WINGS ALL READY TO OPEN WIDE AND BEAR HER
AWAY WHICH COULD BE FELT AS THEY RUSTLED THOUGH THEY COULD NOT BE
SEEN
TO SEE HER THUS ONE WOULD NEVER HAVE DREAMED THAT SHE WAS
AN INVALID WHOSE LIFE WAS ALMOST DESPAIRED OF
SHE RESEMBLED RATHER
SOMETHING ON THE POINT OF SOARING AWAY THAN SOMETHING ON THE POINT OF
DYING
THE BRANCH TREMBLES WHEN A HAND APPROACHES IT TO PLUCK A FLOWER AND
SEEMS TO BOTH WITHDRAW AND TO OFFER ITSELF AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME
THE HUMAN BODY HAS SOMETHING OF THIS TREMOR WHEN THE INSTANT ARRIVES IN
WHICH THE MYSTERIOUS FINGERS OF DEATH ARE ABOUT TO PLUCK THE SOUL
M
MADELEINE REMAINED FOR SOME TIME MOTIONLESS BESIDE THAT BED GAZING
IN TURN UPON THE SICK WOMAN AND THE CRUCIFIX AS HE HAD DONE TWO MONTHS
BEFORE ON THE DAY WHEN HE HAD COME FOR THE FIRST TIME TO SEE HER
IN THAT ASYLUM
THEY WERE BOTH STILL THERE IN THE SAME ATTITUDE SHE
SLEEPING HE PRAYING ONLY NOW AFTER THE LAPSE OF TWO MONTHS HER HAIR
WAS GRAY AND HIS WAS WHITE
THE SISTER HAD NOT ENTERED WITH HIM
HE STOOD BESIDE THE BED WITH HIS
FINGER ON HIS LIPS AS THOUGH THERE WERE SOME ONE IN THE CHAMBER WHOM HE
MUST ENJOIN TO SILENCE
SHE OPENED HER EYES SAW HIM AND SAID QUIETLY WITH A SMILE
AND COSETTE
CHAPTER II FANTINE HAPPY
SHE MADE NO MOVEMENT OF EITHER SURPRISE OR OF JOY SHE WAS JOY ITSELF
THAT SIMPLE QUESTION AND COSETTE WAS PUT WITH SO PROFOUND A FAITH
WITH SO MUCH CERTAINTY WITH SUCH A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF DISQUIET AND OF
DOUBT THAT HE FOUND NOT A WORD OF REPLY
SHE CONTINUED
I KNEW THAT YOU WERE THERE
I WAS ASLEEP BUT I SAW YOU
I HAVE SEEN
YOU FOR A LONG LONG TIME
I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU WITH MY EYES ALL
NIGHT LONG
YOU WERE IN A GLORY AND YOU HAD AROUND YOU ALL SORTS OF
CELESTIAL FORMS
HE RAISED HIS GLANCE TO THE CRUCIFIX
BUT SHE RESUMED TELL ME WHERE COSETTE IS
WHY DID NOT YOU PLACE HER
ON MY BED AGAINST THE MOMENT OF MY WAKING
HE MADE SOME MECHANICAL REPLY WHICH HE WAS NEVER AFTERWARDS ABLE TO
RECALL
FORTUNATELY THE DOCTOR HAD BEEN WARNED AND HE NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE
HE CAME TO THE AID OF M
MADELEINE
CALM YOURSELF MY CHILD SAID THE DOCTOR YOUR CHILD IS HERE
FANTINE'S EYES BEAMED AND FILLED HER WHOLE FACE WITH LIGHT
SHE CLASPED
HER HANDS WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH CONTAINED ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO
PRAYER IN THE WAY OF VIOLENCE AND TENDERNESS
OH SHE EXCLAIMED BRING HER TO ME
TOUCHING ILLUSION OF A MOTHER COSETTE WAS FOR HER STILL THE LITTLE
CHILD WHO IS CARRIED
NOT YET SAID THE DOCTOR NOT JUST NOW
YOU STILL HAVE SOME FEVER
THE SIGHT OF YOUR CHILD WOULD AGITATE YOU AND DO YOU HARM
YOU MUST BE
CURED FIRST
SHE INTERRUPTED HIM IMPETUOUSLY
BUT I AM CURED OH I TELL YOU THAT I AM CURED WHAT AN ASS THAT DOCTOR
IS THE IDEA I WANT TO SEE MY CHILD
YOU SEE SAID THE DOCTOR HOW EXCITED YOU BECOME
SO LONG AS YOU ARE
IN THIS STATE I SHALL OPPOSE YOUR HAVING YOUR CHILD
IT IS NOT ENOUGH
TO SEE HER IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU SHOULD LIVE FOR HER
WHEN YOU ARE
REASONABLE I WILL BRING HER TO YOU MYSELF
THE POOR MOTHER BOWED HER HEAD
I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR I REALLY BEG YOUR PARDON
FORMERLY I SHOULD
NEVER HAVE SPOKEN AS I HAVE JUST DONE SO MANY MISFORTUNES HAVE HAPPENED
TO ME THAT I SOMETIMES DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING
I UNDERSTAND YOU
YOU FEAR THE EMOTION
I WILL WAIT AS LONG AS YOU LIKE BUT I SWEAR TO
YOU THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE HARMED ME TO SEE MY DAUGHTER
I HAVE BEEN
SEEING HER I HAVE NOT TAKEN MY EYES FROM HER SINCE YESTERDAY EVENING
DO YOU KNOW IF SHE WERE BROUGHT TO ME NOW I SHOULD TALK TO HER VERY
GENTLY
THAT IS ALL
IS IT NOT QUITE NATURAL THAT I SHOULD DESIRE TO SEE
MY DAUGHTER WHO HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO ME EXPRESSLY FROM MONTFERMEIL I
AM NOT ANGRY
I KNOW WELL THAT I AM ABOUT TO BE HAPPY
ALL NIGHT LONG I
HAVE SEEN WHITE THINGS AND PERSONS WHO SMILED AT ME
WHEN MONSIEUR LE
DOCTEUR PLEASES HE SHALL BRING ME COSETTE
I HAVE NO LONGER ANY FEVER
I AM WELL
I AM PERFECTLY CONSCIOUS THAT THERE IS NOTHING THE MATTER
WITH ME ANY MORE BUT I AM GOING TO BEHAVE AS THOUGH I WERE ILL AND NOT
STIR TO PLEASE THESE LADIES HERE
WHEN IT IS SEEN THAT I AM VERY CALM
THEY WILL SAY 'SHE MUST HAVE HER CHILD
M
MADELEINE WAS SITTING ON A CHAIR BESIDE THE BED
SHE TURNED TOWARDS
HIM SHE WAS MAKING A VISIBLE EFFORT TO BE CALM AND VERY GOOD AS SHE
EXPRESSED IT IN THE FEEBLENESS OF ILLNESS WHICH RESEMBLES INFANCY IN
ORDER THAT SEEING HER SO PEACEABLE THEY MIGHT MAKE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT
BRINGING COSETTE TO HER
BUT WHILE SHE CONTROLLED HERSELF SHE COULD NOT
REFRAIN FROM QUESTIONING M
MADELEINE
DID YOU HAVE A PLEASANT TRIP MONSIEUR LE MAIRE OH HOW GOOD YOU WERE
TO GO AND GET HER FOR ME ONLY TELL ME HOW SHE IS
DID SHE STAND THE
JOURNEY WELL ALAS SHE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE ME
SHE MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN
ME BY THIS TIME POOR DARLING CHILDREN HAVE NO MEMORIES
THEY ARE LIKE
BIRDS
A CHILD SEES ONE THING TO DAY AND ANOTHER THING TO MORROW AND
THINKS OF NOTHING ANY LONGER
AND DID SHE HAVE WHITE LINEN DID THOSE
THENARDIERS KEEP HER CLEAN HOW HAVE THEY FED HER OH IF YOU ONLY KNEW
HOW I HAVE SUFFERED PUTTING SUCH QUESTIONS AS THAT TO MYSELF DURING ALL
THE TIME OF MY WRETCHEDNESS
NOW IT IS ALL PAST
I AM HAPPY
OH HOW I
SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER DO YOU THINK HER PRETTY MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
IS NOT MY DAUGHTER BEAUTIFUL YOU MUST HAVE BEEN VERY COLD IN THAT
DILIGENCE COULD SHE NOT BE BROUGHT FOR JUST ONE LITTLE INSTANT SHE
MIGHT BE TAKEN AWAY DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS
TELL ME YOU ARE THE MASTER IT
COULD BE SO IF YOU CHOSE
HE TOOK HER HAND
COSETTE IS BEAUTIFUL HE SAID COSETTE IS WELL
YOU SHALL SEE HER SOON BUT CALM YOURSELF YOU ARE TALKING WITH TOO MUCH
VIVACITY AND YOU ARE THROWING YOUR ARMS OUT FROM UNDER THE CLOTHES AND
THAT MAKES YOU COUGH
IN FACT FITS OF COUGHING INTERRUPTED FANTINE AT NEARLY EVERY WORD
FANTINE DID NOT MURMUR SHE FEARED THAT SHE HAD INJURED BY HER TOO
PASSIONATE LAMENTATIONS THE CONFIDENCE WHICH SHE WAS DESIROUS OF
INSPIRING AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK OF INDIFFERENT THINGS
MONTFERMEIL IS QUITE PRETTY IS IT NOT PEOPLE GO THERE ON PLEASURE
PARTIES IN SUMMER
ARE THE THENARDIERS PROSPEROUS THERE ARE NOT MANY
TRAVELLERS IN THEIR PARTS
THAT INN OF THEIRS IS A SORT OF A COOK SHOP
M
MADELEINE WAS STILL HOLDING HER HAND AND GAZING AT HER WITH ANXIETY
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD COME TO TELL HER THINGS BEFORE WHICH HIS MIND
NOW HESITATED
THE DOCTOR HAVING FINISHED HIS VISIT RETIRED
SISTER
SIMPLICE REMAINED ALONE WITH THEM
BUT IN THE MIDST OF THIS PAUSE FANTINE EXCLAIMED
I HEAR HER MON DIEU I HEAR HER
SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARM TO ENJOIN SILENCE ABOUT HER HELD HER BREATH
AND BEGAN TO LISTEN WITH RAPTURE
THERE WAS A CHILD PLAYING IN THE YARD THE CHILD OF THE PORTRESS OR
OF SOME WORK WOMAN
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE ACCIDENTS WHICH ARE ALWAYS
OCCURRING AND WHICH SEEM TO FORM A PART OF THE MYSTERIOUS STAGE SETTING
OF MOURNFUL SCENES
THE CHILD A LITTLE GIRL WAS GOING AND COMING
RUNNING TO WARM HERSELF LAUGHING SINGING AT THE TOP OF HER VOICE
ALAS IN WHAT ARE THE PLAYS OF CHILDREN NOT INTERMINGLED
IT WAS THIS
LITTLE GIRL WHOM FANTINE HEARD SINGING
OH SHE RESUMED IT IS MY COSETTE I RECOGNIZE HER VOICE
THE CHILD RETREATED AS IT HAD COME THE VOICE DIED AWAY
FANTINE
LISTENED FOR A WHILE LONGER THEN HER FACE CLOUDED OVER AND M
MADELEINE HEARD HER SAY IN A LOW VOICE HOW WICKED THAT DOCTOR IS NOT
TO ALLOW ME TO SEE MY DAUGHTER THAT MAN HAS AN EVIL COUNTENANCE THAT
HE HAS
BUT THE SMILING BACKGROUND OF HER THOUGHTS CAME TO THE FRONT AGAIN
SHE
CONTINUED TO TALK TO HERSELF WITH HER HEAD RESTING ON THE PILLOW HOW
HAPPY WE ARE GOING TO BE WE SHALL HAVE A LITTLE GARDEN THE VERY FIRST
THING M
MADELEINE HAS PROMISED IT TO ME
MY DAUGHTER WILL PLAY IN THE
GARDEN
SHE MUST KNOW HER LETTERS BY THIS TIME
I WILL MAKE HER SPELL
SHE WILL RUN OVER THE GRASS AFTER BUTTERFLIES
I WILL WATCH HER
THEN
SHE WILL TAKE HER FIRST COMMUNION
AH WHEN WILL SHE TAKE HER FIRST
COMMUNION
SHE BEGAN TO RECKON ON HER FINGERS
ONE TWO THREE FOUR SHE IS SEVEN YEARS OLD
IN FIVE YEARS SHE WILL
HAVE A WHITE VEIL AND OPENWORK STOCKINGS SHE WILL LOOK LIKE A LITTLE
WOMAN
O MY GOOD SISTER YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW FOOLISH I BECOME WHEN I
THINK OF MY DAUGHTER'S FIRST COMMUNION
SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH
HE HAD RELEASED FANTINE'S HAND
HE LISTENED TO HER WORDS AS ONE LISTENS
TO THE SIGHING OF THE BREEZE WITH HIS EYES ON THE GROUND HIS MIND
ABSORBED IN REFLECTION WHICH HAD NO BOTTOM
ALL AT ONCE SHE CEASED
SPEAKING AND THIS CAUSED HIM TO RAISE HIS HEAD MECHANICALLY
FANTINE
HAD BECOME TERRIBLE
SHE NO LONGER SPOKE SHE NO LONGER BREATHED SHE HAD RAISED HERSELF TO
A SITTING POSTURE HER THIN SHOULDER EMERGED FROM HER CHEMISE HER FACE
WHICH HAD BEEN RADIANT BUT A MOMENT BEFORE WAS GHASTLY AND SHE
SEEMED TO HAVE FIXED HER EYES RENDERED LARGE WITH TERROR ON SOMETHING
ALARMING AT THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF THE ROOM
GOOD GOD HE EXCLAIMED WHAT AILS YOU FANTINE
SHE MADE NO REPLY SHE DID NOT REMOVE HER EYES FROM THE OBJECT WHICH
SHE SEEMED TO SEE
SHE REMOVED ONE HAND FROM HIS ARM AND WITH THE OTHER
MADE HIM A SIGN TO LOOK BEHIND HIM
HE TURNED AND BEHELD JAVERT
CHAPTER III JAVERT SATISFIED
THIS IS WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
THE HALF HOUR AFTER MIDNIGHT HAD JUST STRUCK WHEN M
MADELEINE QUITTED
THE HALL OF ASSIZES IN ARRAS
HE REGAINED HIS INN JUST IN TIME TO SET
OUT AGAIN BY THE MAIL WAGON IN WHICH HE HAD ENGAGED HIS PLACE
A LITTLE
BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING HE HAD ARRIVED AT M
SUR M AND HIS
FIRST CARE HAD BEEN TO POST A LETTER TO M
LAFFITTE THEN TO ENTER THE
INFIRMARY AND SEE FANTINE
HOWEVER HE HAD HARDLY QUITTED THE AUDIENCE HALL OF THE COURT OF
ASSIZES WHEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY RECOVERING FROM HIS FIRST SHOCK
HAD TAKEN THE WORD TO DEPLORE THE MAD DEED OF THE HONORABLE MAYOR OF
M
SUR M TO DECLARE THAT HIS CONVICTIONS HAD NOT BEEN IN THE LEAST
MODIFIED BY THAT CURIOUS INCIDENT WHICH WOULD BE EXPLAINED THEREAFTER
AND TO DEMAND IN THE MEANTIME THE CONDEMNATION OF THAT CHAMPMATHIEU
WHO WAS EVIDENTLY THE REAL JEAN VALJEAN
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
PERSISTENCE WAS VISIBLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE SENTIMENTS OF EVERY ONE OF
THE PUBLIC OF THE COURT AND OF THE JURY
THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE
HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN REFUTING THIS HARANGUE AND IN ESTABLISHING THAT
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE REVELATIONS OF M
MADELEINE THAT IS TO SAY OF
THE REAL JEAN VALJEAN THE ASPECT OF THE MATTER HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY
ALTERED AND THAT THE JURY HAD BEFORE THEIR EYES NOW ONLY AN INNOCENT
MAN
THENCE THE LAWYER HAD DRAWN SOME EPIPHONEMAS NOT VERY FRESH
UNFORTUNATELY UPON JUDICIAL ERRORS ETC ETC THE PRESIDENT IN HIS
SUMMING UP HAD JOINED THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES
THE JURY HAD THROWN CHAMPMATHIEU OUT OF THE CASE
NEVERTHELESS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS BENT ON HAVING A JEAN VALJEAN
AND AS HE HAD NO LONGER CHAMPMATHIEU HE TOOK MADELEINE
IMMEDIATELY AFTER CHAMPMATHIEU HAD BEEN SET AT LIBERTY THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY SHUT HIMSELF UP WITH THE PRESIDENT
THEY CONFERRED AS
TO THE NECESSITY OF SEIZING THE PERSON OF M
LE MAIRE OF M
SUR M
THIS PHRASE IN WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF OF IS THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S WRITTEN WITH HIS OWN HAND ON THE MINUTES OF HIS
REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
HIS FIRST EMOTION HAVING PASSED OFF THE
PRESIDENT DID NOT OFFER MANY OBJECTIONS
JUSTICE MUST AFTER ALL TAKE
ITS COURSE
AND THEN WHEN ALL WAS SAID ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT WAS
A KINDLY AND A TOLERABLY INTELLIGENT MAN HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME A
DEVOTED AND ALMOST AN ARDENT ROYALIST AND HE HAD BEEN SHOCKED TO HEAR
THE MAYOR OF M
SUR M
SAY THE EMPEROR AND NOT BONAPARTE WHEN ALLUDING
TO THE LANDING AT CANNES
THE ORDER FOR HIS ARREST WAS ACCORDINGLY DESPATCHED
THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY FORWARDED IT TO M
SUR M
BY A SPECIAL MESSENGER AT
FULL SPEED AND ENTRUSTED ITS EXECUTION TO POLICE INSPECTOR JAVERT
THE READER KNOWS THAT JAVERT HAD RETURNED TO M
SUR M
IMMEDIATELY AFTER
HAVING GIVEN HIS DEPOSITION
JAVERT WAS JUST GETTING OUT OF BED WHEN THE MESSENGER HANDED HIM THE
ORDER OF ARREST AND THE COMMAND TO PRODUCE THE PRISONER
THE MESSENGER HIMSELF WAS A VERY CLEVER MEMBER OF THE POLICE WHO IN
TWO WORDS INFORMED JAVERT OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AT ARRAS
THE ORDER
OF ARREST SIGNED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS COUCHED IN THESE WORDS
INSPECTOR JAVERT WILL APPREHEND THE BODY OF THE SIEUR MADELEINE MAYOR
OF M
SUR M WHO IN THIS DAY'S SESSION OF THE COURT WAS RECOGNIZED AS
THE LIBERATED CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN
ANY ONE WHO DID NOT KNOW JAVERT AND WHO HAD CHANCED TO SEE HIM AT THE
MOMENT WHEN HE PENETRATED THE ANTECHAMBER OF THE INFIRMARY COULD HAVE
DIVINED NOTHING OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIS AIR
THE MOST ORDINARY IN THE WORLD
HE WAS COOL CALM GRAVE HIS GRAY
HAIR WAS PERFECTLY SMOOTH UPON HIS TEMPLES AND HE HAD JUST MOUNTED
THE STAIRS WITH HIS HABITUAL DELIBERATION
ANY ONE WHO WAS THOROUGHLY
ACQUAINTED WITH HIM AND WHO HAD EXAMINED HIM ATTENTIVELY AT THE MOMENT
WOULD HAVE SHUDDERED
THE BUCKLE OF HIS LEATHER STOCK WAS UNDER HIS
LEFT EAR INSTEAD OF AT THE NAPE OF HIS NECK
THIS BETRAYED UNWONTED
AGITATION
JAVERT WAS A COMPLETE CHARACTER WHO NEVER HAD A WRINKLE IN HIS DUTY OR
IN HIS UNIFORM METHODICAL WITH MALEFACTORS RIGID WITH THE BUTTONS OF
HIS COAT
THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SET THE BUCKLE OF HIS STOCK AWRY IT WAS
INDISPENSABLE THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN HIM ONE OF THOSE
EMOTIONS WHICH MAY BE DESIGNATED AS INTERNAL EARTHQUAKES
HE HAD COME IN A SIMPLE WAY HAD MADE A REQUISITION ON THE NEIGHBORING
POST FOR A CORPORAL AND FOUR SOLDIERS HAD LEFT THE SOLDIERS IN THE
COURTYARD HAD HAD FANTINE'S ROOM POINTED OUT TO HIM BY THE PORTRESS
WHO WAS UTTERLY UNSUSPICIOUS ACCUSTOMED AS SHE WAS TO SEEING ARMED MEN
INQUIRING FOR THE MAYOR
ON ARRIVING AT FANTINE'S CHAMBER JAVERT TURNED THE HANDLE PUSHED
THE DOOR OPEN WITH THE GENTLENESS OF A SICK NURSE OR A POLICE SPY AND
ENTERED
PROPERLY SPEAKING HE DID NOT ENTER
HE STOOD ERECT IN THE HALF OPEN
DOOR HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD AND HIS LEFT HAND THRUST INTO HIS COAT WHICH
WAS BUTTONED UP TO THE CHIN
IN THE BEND OF HIS ELBOW THE LEADEN HEAD OF
HIS ENORMOUS CANE WHICH WAS HIDDEN BEHIND HIM COULD BE SEEN
THUS HE REMAINED FOR NEARLY A MINUTE WITHOUT HIS PRESENCE BEING
PERCEIVED
ALL AT ONCE FANTINE RAISED HER EYES SAW HIM AND MADE M
MADELEINE TURN ROUND
THE INSTANT THAT MADELEINE'S GLANCE ENCOUNTERED JAVERT'S GLANCE JAVERT
WITHOUT STIRRING WITHOUT MOVING FROM HIS POST WITHOUT APPROACHING HIM
BECAME TERRIBLE
NO HUMAN SENTIMENT CAN BE AS TERRIBLE AS JOY
IT WAS THE VISAGE OF A DEMON WHO HAS JUST FOUND HIS DAMNED SOUL
THE SATISFACTION OF AT LAST GETTING HOLD OF JEAN VALJEAN CAUSED ALL THAT
WAS IN HIS SOUL TO APPEAR IN HIS COUNTENANCE
THE DEPTHS HAVING BEEN
STIRRED UP MOUNTED TO THE SURFACE
THE HUMILIATION OF HAVING IN
SOME SLIGHT DEGREE LOST THE SCENT AND OF HAVING INDULGED FOR A FEW
MOMENTS IN AN ERROR WITH REGARD TO CHAMPMATHIEU WAS EFFACED BY PRIDE
AT HAVING SO WELL AND ACCURATELY DIVINED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND OF
HAVING FOR SO LONG CHERISHED A JUST INSTINCT
JAVERT'S CONTENT SHONE
FORTH IN HIS SOVEREIGN ATTITUDE
THE DEFORMITY OF TRIUMPH OVERSPREAD
THAT NARROW BROW
ALL THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF HORROR WHICH A SATISFIED
FACE CAN AFFORD WERE THERE
JAVERT WAS IN HEAVEN AT THAT MOMENT
WITHOUT PUTTING THE THING CLEARLY
TO HIMSELF BUT WITH A CONFUSED INTUITION OF THE NECESSITY OF HIS
PRESENCE AND OF HIS SUCCESS HE JAVERT PERSONIFIED JUSTICE LIGHT AND
TRUTH IN THEIR CELESTIAL FUNCTION OF CRUSHING OUT EVIL
BEHIND HIM AND
AROUND HIM AT AN INFINITE DISTANCE HE HAD AUTHORITY REASON THE CASE
JUDGED THE LEGAL CONSCIENCE THE PUBLIC PROSECUTION ALL THE STARS HE
WAS PROTECTING ORDER HE WAS CAUSING THE LAW TO YIELD UP ITS THUNDERS
HE WAS AVENGING SOCIETY HE WAS LENDING A HELPING HAND TO THE ABSOLUTE
HE WAS STANDING ERECT IN THE MIDST OF A GLORY
THERE EXISTED IN HIS
VICTORY A REMNANT OF DEFIANCE AND OF COMBAT
ERECT HAUGHTY BRILLIANT
HE FLAUNTED ABROAD IN OPEN DAY THE SUPERHUMAN BESTIALITY OF A FEROCIOUS
ARCHANGEL
THE TERRIBLE SHADOW OF THE ACTION WHICH HE WAS ACCOMPLISHING
CAUSED THE VAGUE FLASH OF THE SOCIAL SWORD TO BE VISIBLE IN HIS CLENCHED
FIST HAPPY AND INDIGNANT HE HELD HIS HEEL UPON CRIME VICE REBELLION
PERDITION HELL HE WAS RADIANT HE EXTERMINATED HE SMILED AND THERE
WAS AN INCONTESTABLE GRANDEUR IN THIS MONSTROUS SAINT MICHAEL
JAVERT THOUGH FRIGHTFUL HAD NOTHING IGNOBLE ABOUT HIM
PROBITY SINCERITY CANDOR CONVICTION THE SENSE OF DUTY ARE THINGS
WHICH MAY BECOME HIDEOUS WHEN WRONGLY DIRECTED BUT WHICH EVEN WHEN
HIDEOUS REMAIN GRAND THEIR MAJESTY THE MAJESTY PECULIAR TO THE HUMAN
CONSCIENCE CLINGS TO THEM IN THE MIDST OF HORROR THEY ARE VIRTUES
WHICH HAVE ONE VICE ERROR
THE HONEST PITILESS JOY OF A FANATIC
IN THE FULL FLOOD OF HIS ATROCITY PRESERVES A CERTAIN LUGUBRIOUSLY
VENERABLE RADIANCE
WITHOUT HIMSELF SUSPECTING THE FACT JAVERT IN HIS
FORMIDABLE HAPPINESS WAS TO BE PITIED AS IS EVERY IGNORANT MAN WHO
TRIUMPHS
NOTHING COULD BE SO POIGNANT AND SO TERRIBLE AS THIS FACE
WHEREIN WAS DISPLAYED ALL THAT MAY BE DESIGNATED AS THE EVIL OF THE
GOOD
CHAPTER IV AUTHORITY REASSERTS ITS RIGHTS
FANTINE HAD NOT SEEN JAVERT SINCE THE DAY ON WHICH THE MAYOR HAD TORN
HER FROM THE MAN
HER AILING BRAIN COMPREHENDED NOTHING BUT THE ONLY
THING WHICH SHE DID NOT DOUBT WAS THAT HE HAD COME TO GET HER
SHE COULD
NOT ENDURE THAT TERRIBLE FACE SHE FELT HER LIFE QUITTING HER SHE HID
HER FACE IN BOTH HANDS AND SHRIEKED IN HER ANGUISH
MONSIEUR MADELEINE SAVE ME
JEAN VALJEAN WE SHALL HENCEFORTH NOT SPEAK OF HIM OTHERWISE HAD RISEN
HE SAID TO FANTINE IN THE GENTLEST AND CALMEST OF VOICES
BE AT EASE IT IS NOT FOR YOU THAT HE IS COME
THEN HE ADDRESSED JAVERT AND SAID
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
JAVERT REPLIED
BE QUICK ABOUT IT
THERE LAY IN THE INFLECTION OF VOICE WHICH ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS
SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY FIERCE AND FRENZIED
JAVERT DID NOT SAY BE
QUICK ABOUT IT HE SAID BEQUIABOUIT
NO ORTHOGRAPHY CAN DO JUSTICE TO THE ACCENT WITH WHICH IT WAS UTTERED
IT WAS NO LONGER A HUMAN WORD IT WAS A ROAR
HE DID NOT PROCEED ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM HE DID NOT ENTER INTO THE
MATTER HE EXHIBITED NO WARRANT OF ARREST
IN HIS EYES JEAN VALJEAN
WAS A SORT OF MYSTERIOUS COMBATANT WHO WAS NOT TO BE LAID HANDS UPON
A WRESTLER IN THE DARK WHOM HE HAD HAD IN HIS GRASP FOR THE LAST FIVE
YEARS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO THROW HIM
THIS ARREST WAS NOT A BEGINNING
BUT AN END
HE CONFINED HIMSELF TO SAYING BE QUICK ABOUT IT
AS HE SPOKE THUS HE DID NOT ADVANCE A SINGLE STEP HE HURLED AT JEAN
VALJEAN A GLANCE WHICH HE THREW OUT LIKE A GRAPPLING HOOK AND WITH
WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DRAW WRETCHES VIOLENTLY TO HIM
IT WAS THIS GLANCE WHICH FANTINE HAD FELT PENETRATING TO THE VERY MARROW
OF HER BONES TWO MONTHS PREVIOUSLY
AT JAVERT'S EXCLAMATION FANTINE OPENED HER EYES ONCE MORE
BUT THE
MAYOR WAS THERE WHAT HAD SHE TO FEAR
JAVERT ADVANCED TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND CRIED
SEE HERE NOW ART THOU COMING
THE UNHAPPY WOMAN GLANCED ABOUT HER
NO ONE WAS PRESENT EXCEPTING THE
NUN AND THE MAYOR
TO WHOM COULD THAT ABJECT USE OF THOU BE ADDRESSED
TO HER ONLY
SHE SHUDDERED
THEN SHE BEHELD A MOST UNPRECEDENTED THING A THING SO UNPRECEDENTED
THAT NOTHING EQUAL TO IT HAD APPEARED TO HER EVEN IN THE BLACKEST
DELIRIUMS OF FEVER
SHE BEHELD JAVERT THE POLICE SPY SEIZE THE MAYOR BY THE COLLAR SHE
SAW THE MAYOR BOW HIS HEAD
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THE WORLD WAS COMING
TO AN END
JAVERT HAD IN FACT GRASPED JEAN VALJEAN BY THE COLLAR
MONSIEUR LE MAIRE SHRIEKED FANTINE
JAVERT BURST OUT LAUGHING WITH THAT FRIGHTFUL LAUGH WHICH DISPLAYED ALL
HIS GUMS
THERE IS NO LONGER ANY MONSIEUR LE MAIRE HERE
JEAN VALJEAN MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISENGAGE THE HAND WHICH GRASPED THE
COLLAR OF HIS COAT
HE SAID
JAVERT
JAVERT INTERRUPTED HIM CALL ME MR
INSPECTOR
MONSIEUR SAID JEAN VALJEAN I SHOULD LIKE TO SAY A WORD TO YOU IN
PRIVATE
ALOUD SAY IT ALOUD REPLIED JAVERT PEOPLE ARE IN THE HABIT OF
TALKING ALOUD TO ME
JEAN VALJEAN WENT ON IN A LOWER TONE
I HAVE A REQUEST TO MAKE OF YOU
I TELL YOU TO SPEAK LOUD
BUT YOU ALONE SHOULD HEAR IT
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE TO ME I SHALL NOT LISTEN
JEAN VALJEAN TURNED TOWARDS HIM AND SAID VERY RAPIDLY AND IN A VERY LOW
VOICE
GRANT ME THREE DAYS' GRACE THREE DAYS IN WHICH TO GO AND FETCH THE
CHILD OF THIS UNHAPPY WOMAN
I WILL PAY WHATEVER IS NECESSARY
YOU SHALL
ACCOMPANY ME IF YOU CHOOSE
YOU ARE MAKING SPORT OF ME CRIED JAVERT
COME NOW I DID NOT THINK
YOU SUCH A FOOL YOU ASK ME TO GIVE YOU THREE DAYS IN WHICH TO RUN AWAY
YOU SAY THAT IT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF FETCHING THAT CREATURE'S CHILD
AH AH THAT'S GOOD THAT'S REALLY CAPITAL
FANTINE WAS SEIZED WITH A FIT OF TREMBLING
MY CHILD SHE CRIED TO GO AND FETCH MY CHILD SHE IS NOT HERE
THEN ANSWER ME SISTER WHERE IS COSETTE I WANT MY CHILD MONSIEUR
MADELEINE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
JAVERT STAMPED HIS FOOT
AND NOW THERE'S THE OTHER ONE WILL YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU HUSSY
IT'S A PRETTY SORT OF A PLACE WHERE CONVICTS ARE MAGISTRATES AND WHERE
WOMEN OF THE TOWN ARE CARED FOR LIKE COUNTESSES AH BUT WE ARE GOING TO
CHANGE ALL THAT IT IS HIGH TIME
HE STARED INTENTLY AT FANTINE AND ADDED ONCE MORE TAKING INTO HIS
GRASP JEAN VALJEAN'S CRAVAT SHIRT AND COLLAR
I TELL YOU THAT THERE IS NO MONSIEUR MADELEINE AND THAT THERE IS NO
MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
THERE IS A THIEF A BRIGAND A CONVICT NAMED JEAN
VALJEAN AND I HAVE HIM IN MY GRASP THAT'S WHAT THERE IS
FANTINE RAISED HERSELF IN BED WITH A BOUND SUPPORTING HERSELF ON HER
STIFFENED ARMS AND ON BOTH HANDS SHE GAZED AT JEAN VALJEAN SHE GAZED
AT JAVERT SHE GAZED AT THE NUN SHE OPENED HER MOUTH AS THOUGH TO
SPEAK A RATTLE PROCEEDED FROM THE DEPTHS OF HER THROAT HER TEETH
CHATTERED SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS IN HER AGONY OPENING HER HANDS
CONVULSIVELY AND FUMBLING ABOUT HER LIKE A DROWNING PERSON THEN
SUDDENLY FELL BACK ON HER PILLOW
HER HEAD STRUCK THE HEAD BOARD OF THE BED AND FELL FORWARDS ON HER
BREAST WITH GAPING MOUTH AND STARING SIGHTLESS EYES
SHE WAS DEAD
JEAN VALJEAN LAID HIS HAND UPON THE DETAINING HAND OF JAVERT AND OPENED
IT AS HE WOULD HAVE OPENED THE HAND OF A BABY THEN HE SAID TO JAVERT
YOU HAVE MURDERED THAT WOMAN
LET'S HAVE AN END OF THIS SHOUTED JAVERT IN A FURY I AM NOT HERE
TO LISTEN TO ARGUMENT
LET US ECONOMIZE ALL THAT THE GUARD IS BELOW
MARCH ON INSTANTLY OR YOU'LL GET THE THUMB SCREWS
IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM STOOD AN OLD IRON BEDSTEAD WHICH WAS IN A
DECIDEDLY DECREPIT STATE AND WHICH SERVED THE SISTERS AS A CAMP BED
WHEN THEY WERE WATCHING WITH THE SICK
JEAN VALJEAN STEPPED UP TO THIS
BED IN A TWINKLING WRENCHED OFF THE HEAD PIECE WHICH WAS ALREADY IN A
DILAPIDATED CONDITION AN EASY MATTER TO MUSCLES LIKE HIS GRASPED THE
PRINCIPAL ROD LIKE A BLUDGEON AND GLANCED AT JAVERT
JAVERT RETREATED
TOWARDS THE DOOR
JEAN VALJEAN ARMED WITH HIS BAR OF IRON WALKED
SLOWLY UP TO FANTINE'S COUCH
WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE HE TURNED AND SAID
TO JAVERT IN A VOICE THAT WAS BARELY AUDIBLE
I ADVISE YOU NOT TO DISTURB ME AT THIS MOMENT
ONE THING IS CERTAIN AND THAT IS THAT JAVERT TREMBLED
IT DID OCCUR TO HIM TO SUMMON THE GUARD BUT JEAN VALJEAN MIGHT AVAIL
HIMSELF OF THAT MOMENT TO EFFECT HIS ESCAPE SO HE REMAINED GRASPED
HIS CANE BY THE SMALL END AND LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR POST WITHOUT
REMOVING HIS EYES FROM JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN RESTED HIS ELBOW ON THE KNOB AT THE HEAD OF THE BED AND
HIS BROW ON HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CONTEMPLATE THE MOTIONLESS BODY OF
FANTINE WHICH LAY EXTENDED THERE
HE REMAINED THUS MUTE ABSORBED
EVIDENTLY WITH NO FURTHER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING CONNECTED WITH THIS LIFE
UPON HIS FACE AND IN HIS ATTITUDE THERE WAS NOTHING BUT INEXPRESSIBLE
PITY
AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF THIS MEDITATION HE BENT TOWARDS FANTINE
AND SPOKE TO HER IN A LOW VOICE
WHAT DID HE SAY TO HER WHAT COULD THIS MAN WHO WAS REPROVED SAY TO
THAT WOMAN WHO WAS DEAD WHAT WORDS WERE THOSE NO ONE ON EARTH HEARD
THEM
DID THE DEAD WOMAN HEAR THEM THERE ARE SOME TOUCHING ILLUSIONS
WHICH ARE PERHAPS SUBLIME REALITIES
THE POINT AS TO WHICH THERE
EXISTS NO DOUBT IS THAT SISTER SIMPLICE THE SOLE WITNESS OF THE
INCIDENT OFTEN SAID THAT AT THE MOMENT THAT JEAN VALJEAN WHISPERED IN
FANTINE'S EAR SHE DISTINCTLY BEHELD AN INEFFABLE SMILE DAWN ON THOSE
PALE LIPS AND IN THOSE DIM EYES FILLED WITH THE AMAZEMENT OF THE TOMB
JEAN VALJEAN TOOK FANTINE'S HEAD IN BOTH HIS HANDS AND ARRANGED IT ON
THE PILLOW AS A MOTHER MIGHT HAVE DONE FOR HER CHILD THEN HE TIED THE
STRING OF HER CHEMISE AND SMOOTHED HER HAIR BACK UNDER HER CAP
THAT
DONE HE CLOSED HER EYES
FANTINE'S FACE SEEMED STRANGELY ILLUMINATED AT THAT MOMENT
DEATH THAT SIGNIFIES ENTRANCE INTO THE GREAT LIGHT
FANTINE'S HAND WAS HANGING OVER THE SIDE OF THE BED
JEAN VALJEAN KNELT
DOWN BEFORE THAT HAND LIFTED IT GENTLY AND KISSED IT
THEN HE ROSE AND TURNED TO JAVERT
NOW SAID HE I AM AT YOUR DISPOSAL
CHAPTER V A SUITABLE TOMB
JAVERT DEPOSITED JEAN VALJEAN IN THE CITY PRISON
THE ARREST OF M
MADELEINE OCCASIONED A SENSATION OR RATHER AN
EXTRAORDINARY COMMOTION IN M
SUR M
WE ARE SORRY THAT WE CANNOT CONCEAL
THE FACT THAT AT THE SINGLE WORD HE WAS A CONVICT NEARLY EVERY ONE
DESERTED HIM
IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS ALL THE GOOD THAT HE HAD DONE HAD
BEEN FORGOTTEN AND HE WAS NOTHING BUT A CONVICT FROM THE GALLEYS IT
IS JUST TO ADD THAT THE DETAILS OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AT ARRAS WERE
NOT YET KNOWN
ALL DAY LONG CONVERSATIONS LIKE THE FOLLOWING WERE TO BE
HEARD IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE TOWN
YOU DON'T KNOW HE WAS A LIBERATED CONVICT WHO THE MAYOR BAH
M
MADELEINE YES REALLY HIS NAME WAS NOT MADELEINE AT ALL HE
HAD A FRIGHTFUL NAME BEJEAN BOJEAN BOUJEAN AH GOOD GOD HE
HAS BEEN ARRESTED ARRESTED IN PRISON IN THE CITY PRISON WHILE
WAITING TO BE TRANSFERRED UNTIL HE IS TRANSFERRED HE IS TO BE
TRANSFERRED WHERE IS HE TO BE TAKEN HE WILL BE TRIED AT THE
ASSIZES FOR A HIGHWAY ROBBERY WHICH HE COMMITTED LONG AGO WELL I
SUSPECTED AS MUCH
THAT MAN WAS TOO GOOD TOO PERFECT TOO AFFECTED
HE REFUSED THE CROSS HE BESTOWED SOUS ON ALL THE LITTLE SCAMPS HE CAME
ACROSS
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME EVIL HISTORY BACK OF ALL THAT
THE DRAWING ROOMS PARTICULARLY ABOUNDED IN REMARKS OF THIS NATURE
ONE OLD LADY A SUBSCRIBER TO THE DRAPEAU BLANC MADE THE FOLLOWING
REMARK THE DEPTH OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FATHOM
I AM NOT SORRY
IT WILL BE A LESSON TO THE BONAPARTISTS
IT WAS THUS THAT THE PHANTOM WHICH HAD BEEN CALLED M
MADELEINE VANISHED
FROM M
SUR M
ONLY THREE OR FOUR PERSONS IN ALL THE TOWN REMAINED
FAITHFUL TO HIS MEMORY
THE OLD PORTRESS WHO HAD SERVED HIM WAS AMONG
THE NUMBER
ON THE EVENING OF THAT DAY THE WORTHY OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING IN HER
LODGE STILL IN A THOROUGH FRIGHT AND ABSORBED IN SAD REFLECTIONS
THE FACTORY HAD BEEN CLOSED ALL DAY THE CARRIAGE GATE WAS BOLTED THE
STREET WAS DESERTED
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE BUT THE TWO NUNS
SISTER PERPETUE AND SISTER SIMPLICE WHO WERE WATCHING BESIDE THE BODY
OF FANTINE
TOWARDS THE HOUR WHEN M
MADELEINE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO RETURN HOME
THE GOOD PORTRESS ROSE MECHANICALLY TOOK FROM A DRAWER THE KEY OF
M
MADELEINE'S CHAMBER AND THE FLAT CANDLESTICK WHICH HE USED EVERY
EVENING TO GO UP TO HIS QUARTERS THEN SHE HUNG THE KEY ON THE NAIL
WHENCE HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE IT AND SET THE CANDLESTICK ON ONE
SIDE AS THOUGH SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM
THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN ON HER
CHAIR AND BECAME ABSORBED IN THOUGHT ONCE MORE
THE POOR GOOD OLD
WOMAN HAD DONE ALL THIS WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF IT
IT WAS ONLY AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWO HOURS THAT SHE ROUSED HERSELF FROM
HER REVERY AND EXCLAIMED HOLD MY GOOD GOD JESUS AND I HUNG HIS KEY
ON THE NAIL
AT THAT MOMENT THE SMALL WINDOW IN THE LODGE OPENED A HAND PASSED
THROUGH SEIZED THE KEY AND THE CANDLESTICK AND LIGHTED THE TAPER AT
THE CANDLE WHICH WAS BURNING THERE
THE PORTRESS RAISED HER EYES AND STOOD THERE WITH GAPING MOUTH AND A
SHRIEK WHICH SHE CONFINED TO HER THROAT
SHE KNEW THAT HAND THAT ARM THE SLEEVE OF THAT COAT
IT WAS M
MADELEINE
IT WAS SEVERAL SECONDS BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK SHE HAD A SEIZURE AS SHE
SAID HERSELF WHEN SHE RELATED THE ADVENTURE AFTERWARDS
GOOD GOD MONSIEUR LE MAIRE SHE CRIED AT LAST I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SHE STOPPED THE CONCLUSION OF HER SENTENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN LACKING IN
RESPECT TOWARDS THE BEGINNING
JEAN VALJEAN WAS STILL MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
TO HER
HE FINISHED HER THOUGHT
IN PRISON SAID HE
I WAS THERE I BROKE A BAR OF ONE OF THE WINDOWS
I LET MYSELF DROP FROM THE TOP OF A ROOF AND HERE I AM
I AM GOING UP
TO MY ROOM GO AND FIND SISTER SIMPLICE FOR ME
SHE IS WITH THAT POOR
WOMAN NO DOUBT
THE OLD WOMAN OBEYED IN ALL HASTE
HE GAVE HER NO ORDERS HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT SHE WOULD GUARD HIM BETTER
THAN HE SHOULD GUARD HIMSELF
NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT HOW HE HAD MANAGED TO GET INTO THE COURTYARD
WITHOUT OPENING THE BIG GATES
HE HAD AND ALWAYS CARRIED ABOUT HIM
A PASS KEY WHICH OPENED A LITTLE SIDE DOOR BUT HE MUST HAVE BEEN
SEARCHED AND HIS LATCH KEY MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM
THIS POINT
WAS NEVER EXPLAINED
HE ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE LEADING TO HIS CHAMBER
ON ARRIVING AT THE
TOP HE LEFT HIS CANDLE ON THE TOP STEP OF HIS STAIRS OPENED HIS DOOR
WITH VERY LITTLE NOISE WENT AND CLOSED HIS WINDOW AND HIS SHUTTERS BY
FEELING THEN RETURNED FOR HIS CANDLE AND RE ENTERED HIS ROOM
IT WAS A USEFUL PRECAUTION IT WILL BE RECOLLECTED THAT HIS WINDOW COULD
BE SEEN FROM THE STREET
HE CAST A GLANCE ABOUT HIM AT HIS TABLE AT HIS CHAIR AT HIS BED WHICH
HAD NOT BEEN DISTURBED FOR THREE DAYS
NO TRACE OF THE DISORDER OF THE
NIGHT BEFORE LAST REMAINED
THE PORTRESS HAD DONE UP HIS ROOM ONLY
SHE HAD PICKED OUT OF THE ASHES AND PLACED NEATLY ON THE TABLE THE TWO
IRON ENDS OF THE CUDGEL AND THE FORTY SOU PIECE WHICH HAD BEEN BLACKENED
BY THE FIRE
HE TOOK A SHEET OF PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE THESE ARE THE TWO TIPS OF
MY IRON SHOD CUDGEL AND THE FORTY SOU PIECE STOLEN FROM LITTLE GERVAIS
WHICH I MENTIONED AT THE COURT OF ASSIZES AND HE ARRANGED THIS PIECE
OF PAPER THE BITS OF IRON AND THE COIN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY WERE
THE FIRST THINGS TO BE SEEN ON ENTERING THE ROOM
FROM A CUPBOARD HE
PULLED OUT ONE OF HIS OLD SHIRTS WHICH HE TORE IN PIECES
IN THE
STRIPS OF LINEN THUS PREPARED HE WRAPPED THE TWO SILVER CANDLESTICKS
HE
BETRAYED NEITHER HASTE NOR AGITATION AND WHILE HE WAS WRAPPING UP THE
BISHOP'S CANDLESTICKS HE NIBBLED AT A PIECE OF BLACK BREAD
IT WAS
PROBABLY THE PRISON BREAD WHICH HE HAD CARRIED WITH HIM IN HIS FLIGHT
THIS WAS PROVED BY THE CRUMBS WHICH WERE FOUND ON THE FLOOR OF THE ROOM
WHEN THE AUTHORITIES MADE AN EXAMINATION LATER ON
THERE CAME TWO TAPS AT THE DOOR
COME IN SAID HE
IT WAS SISTER SIMPLICE
SHE WAS PALE HER EYES WERE RED THE CANDLE WHICH SHE CARRIED TREMBLED
IN HER HAND
THE PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE VIOLENCES OF DESTINY IS THAT
HOWEVER POLISHED OR COOL WE MAY BE THEY WRING HUMAN NATURE FROM OUR
VERY BOWELS AND FORCE IT TO REAPPEAR ON THE SURFACE
THE EMOTIONS OF
THAT DAY HAD TURNED THE NUN INTO A WOMAN ONCE MORE
SHE HAD WEPT AND
SHE WAS TREMBLING
JEAN VALJEAN HAD JUST FINISHED WRITING A FEW LINES ON A PAPER WHICH HE
HANDED TO THE NUN SAYING SISTER YOU WILL GIVE THIS TO MONSIEUR LE
CURE
THE PAPER WAS NOT FOLDED
SHE CAST A GLANCE UPON IT
YOU CAN READ IT SAID HE
SHE READ
I BEG MONSIEUR LE CURE TO KEEP AN EYE ON ALL THAT I LEAVE BEHIND ME
HE
WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO PAY OUT OF IT THE EXPENSES OF MY TRIAL AND OF THE
FUNERAL OF THE WOMAN WHO DIED YESTERDAY
THE REST IS FOR THE POOR
THE SISTER TRIED TO SPEAK BUT SHE ONLY MANAGED TO STAMMER A FEW
INARTICULATE SOUNDS
SHE SUCCEEDED IN SAYING HOWEVER
DOES NOT MONSIEUR LE MAIRE DESIRE TO TAKE A LAST LOOK AT THAT POOR
UNHAPPY WOMAN
NO SAID HE I AM PURSUED IT WOULD ONLY END IN THEIR ARRESTING ME IN
THAT ROOM AND THAT WOULD DISTURB HER
HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED WHEN A LOUD NOISE BECAME AUDIBLE ON THE
STAIRCASE
THEY HEARD A TUMULT OF ASCENDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE OLD
PORTRESS SAYING IN HER LOUDEST AND MOST PIERCING TONES
MY GOOD SIR I SWEAR TO YOU BY THE GOOD GOD THAT NOT A SOUL HAS
ENTERED THIS HOUSE ALL DAY NOR ALL THE EVENING AND THAT I HAVE NOT
EVEN LEFT THE DOOR
A MAN RESPONDED
BUT THERE IS A LIGHT IN THAT ROOM NEVERTHELESS
THEY RECOGNIZED JAVERT'S VOICE
THE CHAMBER WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE DOOR IN OPENING MASKED THE CORNER
OF THE WALL ON THE RIGHT
JEAN VALJEAN BLEW OUT THE LIGHT AND PLACED
HIMSELF IN THIS ANGLE
SISTER SIMPLICE FELL ON HER KNEES NEAR THE TABLE
THE DOOR OPENED
JAVERT ENTERED
THE WHISPERS OF MANY MEN AND THE PROTESTATIONS OF THE PORTRESS WERE
AUDIBLE IN THE CORRIDOR
THE NUN DID NOT RAISE HER EYES
SHE WAS PRAYING
THE CANDLE WAS ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE AND GAVE BUT VERY LITTLE LIGHT
JAVERT CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE NUN AND HALTED IN AMAZEMENT
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT IN JAVERT HIS ELEMENT
THE VERY AIR HE BREATHED WAS VENERATION FOR ALL AUTHORITY
THIS WAS
IMPREGNABLE AND ADMITTED OF NEITHER OBJECTION NOR RESTRICTION
IN HIS
EYES OF COURSE THE ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY WAS THE CHIEF OF ALL HE
WAS RELIGIOUS SUPERFICIAL AND CORRECT ON THIS POINT AS ON ALL OTHERS
IN HIS EYES A PRIEST WAS A MIND WHO NEVER MAKES A MISTAKE A NUN WAS A
CREATURE WHO NEVER SINS THEY WERE SOULS WALLED IN FROM THIS WORLD
WITH A SINGLE DOOR WHICH NEVER OPENED EXCEPT TO ALLOW THE TRUTH TO PASS
THROUGH
ON PERCEIVING THE SISTER HIS FIRST MOVEMENT WAS TO RETIRE
BUT THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER DUTY WHICH BOUND HIM AND IMPELLED HIM
IMPERIOUSLY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
HIS SECOND MOVEMENT WAS TO REMAIN
AND TO VENTURE ON AT LEAST ONE QUESTION
THIS WAS SISTER SIMPLICE WHO HAD NEVER TOLD A LIE IN HER LIFE
JAVERT
KNEW IT AND HELD HER IN SPECIAL VENERATION IN CONSEQUENCE
SISTER SAID HE ARE YOU ALONE IN THIS ROOM
A TERRIBLE MOMENT ENSUED DURING WHICH THE POOR PORTRESS FELT AS THOUGH
SHE SHOULD FAINT
THE SISTER RAISED HER EYES AND ANSWERED
YES
THEN RESUMED JAVERT YOU WILL EXCUSE ME IF I PERSIST IT IS MY DUTY
YOU HAVE NOT SEEN A CERTAIN PERSON A MAN THIS EVENING HE HAS ESCAPED
WE ARE IN SEARCH OF HIM THAT JEAN VALJEAN YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HIM
THE SISTER REPLIED
NO
SHE LIED
SHE HAD LIED TWICE IN SUCCESSION ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITHOUT
HESITATION PROMPTLY AS A PERSON DOES WHEN SACRIFICING HERSELF
PARDON ME SAID JAVERT AND HE RETIRED WITH A DEEP BOW
O SAINTED MAID YOU LEFT THIS WORLD MANY YEARS AGO YOU HAVE REJOINED
YOUR SISTERS THE VIRGINS AND YOUR BROTHERS THE ANGELS IN THE LIGHT
MAY THIS LIE BE COUNTED TO YOUR CREDIT IN PARADISE
THE SISTER'S AFFIRMATION WAS FOR JAVERT SO DECISIVE A THING THAT HE DID
NOT EVEN OBSERVE THE SINGULARITY OF THAT CANDLE WHICH HAD BUT JUST BEEN
EXTINGUISHED AND WHICH WAS STILL SMOKING ON THE TABLE
AN HOUR LATER A MAN MARCHING AMID TREES AND MISTS WAS RAPIDLY
DEPARTING FROM M
SUR M
IN THE DIRECTION OF PARIS
THAT MAN WAS JEAN
VALJEAN
IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE
CARTERS WHO MET HIM THAT HE WAS CARRYING A BUNDLE THAT HE WAS DRESSED
IN A BLOUSE
WHERE HAD HE OBTAINED THAT BLOUSE NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT
BUT AN AGED WORKMAN HAD DIED IN THE INFIRMARY OF THE FACTORY A FEW DAYS
BEFORE LEAVING BEHIND HIM NOTHING BUT HIS BLOUSE
PERHAPS THAT WAS THE
ONE
ONE LAST WORD ABOUT FANTINE
WE ALL HAVE A MOTHER THE EARTH
FANTINE WAS GIVEN BACK TO THAT MOTHER
THE CURE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS DOING RIGHT AND PERHAPS HE REALLY WAS IN
RESERVING AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE FROM WHAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD LEFT FOR
THE POOR
WHO WAS CONCERNED AFTER ALL A CONVICT AND A WOMAN OF THE
TOWN
THAT IS WHY HE HAD A VERY SIMPLE FUNERAL FOR FANTINE AND REDUCED
IT TO THAT STRICTLY NECESSARY FORM KNOWN AS THE PAUPER'S GRAVE
SO FANTINE WAS BURIED IN THE FREE CORNER OF THE CEMETERY WHICH BELONGS
TO ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY AND WHERE THE POOR ARE LOST
FORTUNATELY GOD
KNOWS WHERE TO FIND THE SOUL AGAIN
FANTINE WAS LAID IN THE SHADE
AMONG THE FIRST BONES THAT CAME TO HAND SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO THE
PROMISCUOUSNESS OF ASHES
SHE WAS THROWN INTO THE PUBLIC GRAVE
HER
GRAVE RESEMBLED HER BED

CHAPTER I WHAT IS MET WITH ON THE WAY FROM NIVELLES
LAST YEAR 1861 ON A BEAUTIFUL MAY MORNING A TRAVELLER THE PERSON
WHO IS TELLING THIS STORY WAS COMING FROM NIVELLES AND DIRECTING HIS
COURSE TOWARDS LA HULPE
HE WAS ON FOOT
HE WAS PURSUING A BROAD PAVED
ROAD WHICH UNDULATED BETWEEN TWO ROWS OF TREES OVER THE HILLS WHICH
SUCCEED EACH OTHER RAISE THE ROAD AND LET IT FALL AGAIN AND PRODUCE
SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF ENORMOUS WAVES
HE HAD PASSED LILLOIS AND BOIS SEIGNEUR ISAAC
IN THE WEST HE PERCEIVED
THE SLATE ROOFED TOWER OF BRAINE L'ALLEUD WHICH HAS THE FORM OF A
REVERSED VASE
HE HAD JUST LEFT BEHIND A WOOD UPON AN EMINENCE AND
AT THE ANGLE OF THE CROSS ROAD BY THE SIDE OF A SORT OF MOULDY GIBBET
BEARING THE INSCRIPTION ANCIENT BARRIER NO
4 A PUBLIC HOUSE BEARING
ON ITS FRONT THIS SIGN AT THE FOUR WINDS AUX QUATRE VENTS
ECHABEAU
PRIVATE CAFE
A QUARTER OF A LEAGUE FURTHER ON HE ARRIVED AT THE BOTTOM OF A LITTLE
VALLEY WHERE THERE IS WATER WHICH PASSES BENEATH AN ARCH MADE THROUGH
THE EMBANKMENT OF THE ROAD
THE CLUMP OF SPARSELY PLANTED BUT VERY GREEN
TREES WHICH FILLS THE VALLEY ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD IS DISPERSED OVER
THE MEADOWS ON THE OTHER AND DISAPPEARS GRACEFULLY AND AS IN ORDER IN
THE DIRECTION OF BRAINE L'ALLEUD
ON THE RIGHT CLOSE TO THE ROAD WAS AN INN WITH A FOUR WHEELED CART
AT THE DOOR A LARGE BUNDLE OF HOP POLES A PLOUGH A HEAP OF DRIED
BRUSHWOOD NEAR A FLOURISHING HEDGE LIME SMOKING IN A SQUARE HOLE AND
A LADDER SUSPENDED ALONG AN OLD PENTHOUSE WITH STRAW PARTITIONS
A YOUNG
GIRL WAS WEEDING IN A FIELD WHERE A HUGE YELLOW POSTER PROBABLY OF
SOME OUTSIDE SPECTACLE SUCH AS A PARISH FESTIVAL WAS FLUTTERING IN
THE WIND
AT ONE CORNER OF THE INN BESIDE A POOL IN WHICH A FLOTILLA
OF DUCKS WAS NAVIGATING A BADLY PAVED PATH PLUNGED INTO THE BUSHES
THE
WAYFARER STRUCK INTO THIS
AFTER TRAVERSING A HUNDRED PACES SKIRTING A WALL OF THE FIFTEENTH
CENTURY SURMOUNTED BY A POINTED GABLE WITH BRICKS SET IN CONTRAST HE
FOUND HIMSELF BEFORE A LARGE DOOR OF ARCHED STONE WITH A RECTILINEAR
IMPOST IN THE SOMBRE STYLE OF LOUIS XIV FLANKED BY TWO FLAT
MEDALLIONS
A SEVERE FACADE ROSE ABOVE THIS DOOR A WALL PERPENDICULAR
TO THE FACADE ALMOST TOUCHED THE DOOR AND FLANKED IT WITH AN ABRUPT
RIGHT ANGLE
IN THE MEADOW BEFORE THE DOOR LAY THREE HARROWS THROUGH
WHICH IN DISORDER GREW ALL THE FLOWERS OF MAY
THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
THE TWO DECREPIT LEAVES WHICH BARRED IT WERE ORNAMENTED WITH AN OLD
RUSTY KNOCKER
THE SUN WAS CHARMING THE BRANCHES HAD THAT SOFT SHIVERING OF MAY
WHICH SEEMS TO PROCEED RATHER FROM THE NESTS THAN FROM THE WIND
A BRAVE
LITTLE BIRD PROBABLY A LOVER WAS CAROLLING IN A DISTRACTED MANNER IN A
LARGE TREE
THE WAYFARER BENT OVER AND EXAMINED A RATHER LARGE CIRCULAR EXCAVATION
RESEMBLING THE HOLLOW OF A SPHERE IN THE STONE ON THE LEFT AT THE FOOT
OF THE PIER OF THE DOOR
AT THIS MOMENT THE LEAVES OF THE DOOR PARTED AND A PEASANT WOMAN
EMERGED
SHE SAW THE WAYFARER AND PERCEIVED WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT
IT WAS A FRENCH CANNON BALL WHICH MADE THAT SHE SAID TO HIM
AND SHE
ADDED
THAT WHICH YOU SEE THERE HIGHER UP IN THE DOOR NEAR A NAIL IS THE
HOLE OF A BIG IRON BULLET AS LARGE AS AN EGG
THE BULLET DID NOT PIERCE
THE WOOD
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS PLACE INQUIRED THE WAYFARER
HOUGOMONT SAID THE PEASANT WOMAN
THE TRAVELLER STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP
HE WALKED ON A FEW PACES AND
WENT OFF TO LOOK OVER THE TOPS OF THE HEDGES
ON THE HORIZON THROUGH THE
TREES HE PERCEIVED A SORT OF LITTLE ELEVATION AND ON THIS ELEVATION
SOMETHING WHICH AT THAT DISTANCE RESEMBLED A LION
HE WAS ON THE BATTLE FIELD OF WATERLOO
CHAPTER II HOUGOMONT
HOUGOMONT THIS WAS A FUNEREAL SPOT THE BEGINNING OF THE OBSTACLE
THE FIRST RESISTANCE WHICH THAT GREAT WOOD CUTTER OF EUROPE CALLED
NAPOLEON ENCOUNTERED AT WATERLOO THE FIRST KNOT UNDER THE BLOWS OF HIS
AXE
IT WAS A CHATEAU IT IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT A FARM
FOR THE
ANTIQUARY HOUGOMONT IS HUGOMONS
THIS MANOR WAS BUILT BY HUGO SIRE
OF SOMEREL THE SAME WHO ENDOWED THE SIXTH CHAPLAINCY OF THE ABBEY OF
VILLIERS
THE TRAVELLER PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR ELBOWED AN ANCIENT CALASH UNDER THE
PORCH AND ENTERED THE COURTYARD
THE FIRST THING WHICH STRUCK HIM IN THIS PADDOCK WAS A DOOR OF THE
SIXTEENTH CENTURY WHICH HERE SIMULATES AN ARCADE EVERYTHING ELSE
HAVING FALLEN PROSTRATE AROUND IT
A MONUMENTAL ASPECT OFTEN HAS ITS
BIRTH IN RUIN
IN A WALL NEAR THE ARCADE OPENS ANOTHER ARCHED DOOR OF
THE TIME OF HENRY IV PERMITTING A GLIMPSE OF THE TREES OF AN ORCHARD
BESIDE THIS DOOR A MANURE HOLE SOME PICKAXES SOME SHOVELS SOME
CARTS AN OLD WELL WITH ITS FLAGSTONE AND ITS IRON REEL A CHICKEN
JUMPING AND A TURKEY SPREADING ITS TAIL A CHAPEL SURMOUNTED BY A SMALL
BELL TOWER A BLOSSOMING PEAR TREE TRAINED IN ESPALIER AGAINST THE
WALL OF THE CHAPEL BEHOLD THE COURT THE CONQUEST OF WHICH WAS ONE OF
NAPOLEON'S DREAMS
THIS CORNER OF EARTH COULD HE BUT HAVE SEIZED
IT WOULD PERHAPS HAVE GIVEN HIM THE WORLD LIKEWISE
CHICKENS ARE
SCATTERING ITS DUST ABROAD WITH THEIR BEAKS
A GROWL IS AUDIBLE IT IS A
HUGE DOG WHO SHOWS HIS TEETH AND REPLACES THE ENGLISH
THE ENGLISH BEHAVED ADMIRABLY THERE
COOKE'S FOUR COMPANIES OF GUARDS
THERE HELD OUT FOR SEVEN HOURS AGAINST THE FURY OF AN ARMY
HOUGOMONT VIEWED ON THE MAP AS A GEOMETRICAL PLAN COMPRISING BUILDINGS
AND ENCLOSURES PRESENTS A SORT OF IRREGULAR RECTANGLE ONE ANGLE OF
WHICH IS NICKED OUT
IT IS THIS ANGLE WHICH CONTAINS THE SOUTHERN
DOOR GUARDED BY THIS WALL WHICH COMMANDS IT ONLY A GUN'S LENGTH AWAY
HOUGOMONT HAS TWO DOORS THE SOUTHERN DOOR THAT OF THE CHATEAU AND
THE NORTHERN DOOR BELONGING TO THE FARM
NAPOLEON SENT HIS BROTHER
JEROME AGAINST HOUGOMONT THE DIVISIONS OF FOY GUILLEMINOT AND BACHELU
HURLED THEMSELVES AGAINST IT NEARLY THE ENTIRE CORPS OF REILLE WAS
EMPLOYED AGAINST IT AND MISCARRIED KELLERMANN'S BALLS WERE EXHAUSTED
ON THIS HEROIC SECTION OF WALL
BAUDUIN'S BRIGADE WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO FORCE HOUGOMONT ON THE NORTH AND THE BRIGADE OF SOYE COULD NOT DO
MORE THAN EFFECT THE BEGINNING OF A BREACH ON THE SOUTH BUT WITHOUT
TAKING IT
THE FARM BUILDINGS BORDER THE COURTYARD ON THE SOUTH
A BIT OF THE NORTH
DOOR BROKEN BY THE FRENCH HANGS SUSPENDED TO THE WALL
IT CONSISTS OF
FOUR PLANKS NAILED TO TWO CROSS BEAMS ON WHICH THE SCARS OF THE ATTACK
ARE VISIBLE
THE NORTHERN DOOR WHICH WAS BEATEN IN BY THE FRENCH AND WHICH HAS HAD
A PIECE APPLIED TO IT TO REPLACE THE PANEL SUSPENDED ON THE WALL STANDS
HALF OPEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PADDOCK IT IS CUT SQUARELY IN THE WALL
BUILT OF STONE BELOW OF BRICK ABOVE WHICH CLOSES IN THE COURTYARD ON
THE NORTH
IT IS A SIMPLE DOOR FOR CARTS SUCH AS EXIST IN ALL FARMS
WITH THE TWO LARGE LEAVES MADE OF RUSTIC PLANKS BEYOND LIE THE MEADOWS
THE DISPUTE OVER THIS ENTRANCE WAS FURIOUS
FOR A LONG TIME ALL SORTS
OF IMPRINTS OF BLOODY HANDS WERE VISIBLE ON THE DOOR POSTS
IT WAS THERE
THAT BAUDUIN WAS KILLED
THE STORM OF THE COMBAT STILL LINGERS IN THIS COURTYARD ITS HORROR IS
VISIBLE THERE THE CONFUSION OF THE FRAY WAS PETRIFIED THERE IT LIVES
AND IT DIES THERE IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY
THE WALLS ARE IN THE DEATH
AGONY THE STONES FALL THE BREACHES CRY ALOUD THE HOLES ARE WOUNDS
THE DROOPING QUIVERING TREES SEEM TO BE MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLEE
THIS COURTYARD WAS MORE BUILT UP IN 1815 THAN IT IS TO DAY
BUILDINGS
WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN PULLED DOWN THEN FORMED REDANS AND ANGLES
THE ENGLISH BARRICADED THEMSELVES THERE THE FRENCH MADE THEIR WAY IN
BUT COULD NOT STAND THEIR GROUND
BESIDE THE CHAPEL ONE WING OF THE
CHATEAU THE ONLY RUIN NOW REMAINING OF THE MANOR OF HOUGOMONT RISES IN
A CRUMBLING STATE DISEMBOWELLED ONE MIGHT SAY
THE CHATEAU SERVED
FOR A DUNGEON THE CHAPEL FOR A BLOCK HOUSE
THERE MEN EXTERMINATED EACH
OTHER
THE FRENCH FIRED ON FROM EVERY POINT FROM BEHIND THE WALLS
FROM THE SUMMITS OF THE GARRETS FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE CELLARS THROUGH
ALL THE CASEMENTS THROUGH ALL THE AIR HOLES THROUGH EVERY CRACK IN THE
STONES FETCHED FAGOTS AND SET FIRE TO WALLS AND MEN THE REPLY TO THE
GRAPE SHOT WAS A CONFLAGRATION
IN THE RUINED WING THROUGH WINDOWS GARNISHED WITH BARS OF IRON THE
DISMANTLED CHAMBERS OF THE MAIN BUILDING OF BRICK ARE VISIBLE THE
ENGLISH GUARDS WERE IN AMBUSH IN THESE ROOMS THE SPIRAL OF THE
STAIRCASE CRACKED FROM THE GROUND FLOOR TO THE VERY ROOF APPEARS
LIKE THE INSIDE OF A BROKEN SHELL
THE STAIRCASE HAS TWO STORIES THE
ENGLISH BESIEGED ON THE STAIRCASE AND MASSED ON ITS UPPER STEPS HAD
CUT OFF THE LOWER STEPS
THESE CONSISTED OF LARGE SLABS OF BLUE STONE
WHICH FORM A HEAP AMONG THE NETTLES
HALF A SCORE OF STEPS STILL
CLING TO THE WALL ON THE FIRST IS CUT THE FIGURE OF A TRIDENT
THESE
INACCESSIBLE STEPS ARE SOLID IN THEIR NICHES
ALL THE REST RESEMBLES A
JAW WHICH HAS BEEN DENUDED OF ITS TEETH
THERE ARE TWO OLD TREES THERE
ONE IS DEAD THE OTHER IS WOUNDED AT ITS BASE AND IS CLOTHED WITH
VERDURE IN APRIL
SINCE 1815 IT HAS TAKEN TO GROWING THROUGH THE
STAIRCASE
A MASSACRE TOOK PLACE IN THE CHAPEL
THE INTERIOR WHICH HAS RECOVERED
ITS CALM IS SINGULAR
THE MASS HAS NOT BEEN SAID THERE SINCE THE
CARNAGE
NEVERTHELESS THE ALTAR HAS BEEN LEFT THERE AN ALTAR OF
UNPOLISHED WOOD PLACED AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF ROUGHHEWN STONE
FOUR
WHITEWASHED WALLS A DOOR OPPOSITE THE ALTAR TWO SMALL ARCHED WINDOWS
OVER THE DOOR A LARGE WOODEN CRUCIFIX BELOW THE CRUCIFIX A SQUARE
AIR HOLE STOPPED UP WITH A BUNDLE OF HAY ON THE GROUND IN ONE CORNER
AN OLD WINDOW FRAME WITH THE GLASS ALL BROKEN TO PIECES SUCH IS THE
CHAPEL
NEAR THE ALTAR THERE IS NAILED UP A WOODEN STATUE OF SAINT ANNE
OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY THE HEAD OF THE INFANT JESUS HAS BEEN CARRIED
OFF BY A LARGE BALL
THE FRENCH WHO WERE MASTERS OF THE CHAPEL FOR A
MOMENT AND WERE THEN DISLODGED SET FIRE TO IT
THE FLAMES FILLED THIS
BUILDING IT WAS A PERFECT FURNACE THE DOOR WAS BURNED THE FLOOR WAS
BURNED THE WOODEN CHRIST WAS NOT BURNED
THE FIRE PREYED UPON HIS
FEET OF WHICH ONLY THE BLACKENED STUMPS ARE NOW TO BE SEEN THEN IT
STOPPED A MIRACLE ACCORDING TO THE ASSERTION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD
THE INFANT JESUS DECAPITATED WAS LESS FORTUNATE THAN THE
CHRIST
THE WALLS ARE COVERED WITH INSCRIPTIONS
NEAR THE FEET OF CHRIST THIS
NAME IS TO BE READ HENQUINEZ
THEN THESE OTHERS CONDE DE RIO MAIOR
MARQUES Y MARQUESA DE ALMAGRO HABANA
THERE ARE FRENCH NAMES WITH
EXCLAMATION POINTS A SIGN OF WRATH
THE WALL WAS FRESHLY WHITEWASHED
IN 1849
THE NATIONS INSULTED EACH OTHER THERE
IT WAS AT THE DOOR OF THIS CHAPEL THAT THE CORPSE WAS PICKED UP WHICH
HELD AN AXE IN ITS HAND THIS CORPSE WAS SUB LIEUTENANT LEGROS
ON EMERGING FROM THE CHAPEL A WELL IS VISIBLE ON THE LEFT
THERE ARE
TWO IN THIS COURTYARD
ONE INQUIRES WHY IS THERE NO BUCKET AND PULLEY
TO THIS IT IS BECAUSE WATER IS NO LONGER DRAWN THERE
WHY IS WATER NOT
DRAWN THERE BECAUSE IT IS FULL OF SKELETONS
THE LAST PERSON WHO DREW WATER FROM THE WELL WAS NAMED GUILLAUME VAN
KYLSOM
HE WAS A PEASANT WHO LIVED AT HOUGOMONT AND WAS GARDENER THERE
ON THE 18TH OF JUNE 1815 HIS FAMILY FLED AND CONCEALED THEMSELVES IN
THE WOODS
THE FOREST SURROUNDING THE ABBEY OF VILLIERS SHELTERED THESE UNFORTUNATE
PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN SCATTERED ABROAD FOR MANY DAYS AND NIGHTS
THERE
ARE AT THIS DAY CERTAIN TRACES RECOGNIZABLE SUCH AS OLD BOLES OF BURNED
TREES WHICH MARK THE SITE OF THESE POOR BIVOUACS TREMBLING IN THE
DEPTHS OF THE THICKETS
GUILLAUME VAN KYLSOM REMAINED AT HOUGOMONT TO GUARD THE CHATEAU AND
CONCEALED HIMSELF IN THE CELLAR
THE ENGLISH DISCOVERED HIM THERE
THEY TORE HIM FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND THE COMBATANTS FORCED THIS
FRIGHTENED MAN TO SERVE THEM BY ADMINISTERING BLOWS WITH THE FLATS OF
THEIR SWORDS
THEY WERE THIRSTY THIS GUILLAUME BROUGHT THEM WATER
IT
WAS FROM THIS WELL THAT HE DREW IT
MANY DRANK THERE THEIR LAST DRAUGHT
THIS WELL WHERE DRANK SO MANY OF THE DEAD WAS DESTINED TO DIE ITSELF
AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT THEY WERE IN HASTE TO BURY THE DEAD BODIES
DEATH
HAS A FASHION OF HARASSING VICTORY AND SHE CAUSES THE PEST TO FOLLOW
GLORY
THE TYPHUS IS A CONCOMITANT OF TRIUMPH
THIS WELL WAS DEEP AND
IT WAS TURNED INTO A SEPULCHRE
THREE HUNDRED DEAD BODIES WERE CAST INTO
IT
WITH TOO MUCH HASTE PERHAPS
WERE THEY ALL DEAD LEGEND SAYS THEY
WERE NOT
IT SEEMS THAT ON THE NIGHT SUCCEEDING THE INTERMENT FEEBLE
VOICES WERE HEARD CALLING FROM THE WELL
THIS WELL IS ISOLATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COURTYARD
THREE WALLS PART
STONE PART BRICK AND SIMULATING A SMALL SQUARE TOWER AND FOLDED LIKE
THE LEAVES OF A SCREEN SURROUND IT ON ALL SIDES
THE FOURTH SIDE IS
OPEN
IT IS THERE THAT THE WATER WAS DRAWN
THE WALL AT THE BOTTOM HAS
A SORT OF SHAPELESS LOOPHOLE POSSIBLY THE HOLE MADE BY A SHELL
THIS
LITTLE TOWER HAD A PLATFORM OF WHICH ONLY THE BEAMS REMAIN
THE IRON
SUPPORTS OF THE WELL ON THE RIGHT FORM A CROSS
ON LEANING OVER THE
EYE IS LOST IN A DEEP CYLINDER OF BRICK WHICH IS FILLED WITH A HEAPED UP
MASS OF SHADOWS
THE BASE OF THE WALLS ALL ABOUT THE WELL IS CONCEALED
IN A GROWTH OF NETTLES
THIS WELL HAS NOT IN FRONT OF IT THAT LARGE BLUE SLAB WHICH FORMS THE
TABLE FOR ALL WELLS IN BELGIUM
THE SLAB HAS HERE BEEN REPLACED BY A
CROSS BEAM AGAINST WHICH LEAN FIVE OR SIX SHAPELESS FRAGMENTS OF KNOTTY
AND PETRIFIED WOOD WHICH RESEMBLE HUGE BONES
THERE IS NO LONGER EITHER
PAIL CHAIN OR PULLEY BUT THERE IS STILL THE STONE BASIN WHICH SERVED
THE OVERFLOW
THE RAIN WATER COLLECTS THERE AND FROM TIME TO TIME A
BIRD OF THE NEIGHBORING FORESTS COMES THITHER TO DRINK AND THEN FLIES
AWAY
ONE HOUSE IN THIS RUIN THE FARMHOUSE IS STILL INHABITED
THE
DOOR OF THIS HOUSE OPENS ON THE COURTYARD
UPON THIS DOOR BESIDE A
PRETTY GOTHIC LOCK PLATE THERE IS AN IRON HANDLE WITH TREFOILS PLACED
SLANTING
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE HANOVERIAN LIEUTENANT WILDA GRASPED
THIS HANDLE IN ORDER TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE FARM A FRENCH SAPPER HEWED
OFF HIS HAND WITH AN AXE
THE FAMILY WHO OCCUPY THE HOUSE HAD FOR THEIR GRANDFATHER GUILLAUME VAN
KYLSOM THE OLD GARDENER DEAD LONG SINCE
A WOMAN WITH GRAY HAIR SAID
TO US I WAS THERE
I WAS THREE YEARS OLD
MY SISTER WHO WAS OLDER
WAS TERRIFIED AND WEPT
THEY CARRIED US OFF TO THE WOODS
I WENT THERE
IN MY MOTHER'S ARMS
WE GLUED OUR EARS TO THE EARTH TO HEAR
I IMITATED
THE CANNON AND WENT BOUM BOUM
A DOOR OPENING FROM THE COURTYARD ON THE LEFT LED INTO THE ORCHARD SO
WE WERE TOLD
THE ORCHARD IS TERRIBLE
IT IS IN THREE PARTS ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY IN THREE ACTS
THE FIRST
PART IS A GARDEN THE SECOND IS AN ORCHARD THE THIRD IS A WOOD
THESE
THREE PARTS HAVE A COMMON ENCLOSURE ON THE SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE THE
BUILDINGS OF THE CHATEAU AND THE FARM ON THE LEFT A HEDGE ON THE
RIGHT A WALL AND AT THE END A WALL
THE WALL ON THE RIGHT IS OF
BRICK THE WALL AT THE BOTTOM IS OF STONE
ONE ENTERS THE GARDEN FIRST
IT SLOPES DOWNWARDS IS PLANTED WITH GOOSEBERRY BUSHES CHOKED WITH A
WILD GROWTH OF VEGETATION AND TERMINATED BY A MONUMENTAL TERRACE OF CUT
STONE WITH BALUSTRADE WITH A DOUBLE CURVE
IT WAS A SEIGNORIAL GARDEN IN THE FIRST FRENCH STYLE WHICH PRECEDED LE
NOTRE TO DAY IT IS RUINS AND BRIARS
THE PILASTERS ARE SURMOUNTED BY
GLOBES WHICH RESEMBLE CANNON BALLS OF STONE
FORTY THREE BALUSTERS CAN
STILL BE COUNTED ON THEIR SOCKETS THE REST LIE PROSTRATE IN THE GRASS
ALMOST ALL BEAR SCRATCHES OF BULLETS
ONE BROKEN BALUSTER IS PLACED ON
THE PEDIMENT LIKE A FRACTURED LEG
IT WAS IN THIS GARDEN FURTHER DOWN THAN THE ORCHARD THAT SIX
LIGHT INFANTRY MEN OF THE 1ST HAVING MADE THEIR WAY THITHER AND BEING
UNABLE TO ESCAPE HUNTED DOWN AND CAUGHT LIKE BEARS IN THEIR DENS
ACCEPTED THE COMBAT WITH TWO HANOVERIAN COMPANIES ONE OF WHICH WAS
ARMED WITH CARBINES
THE HANOVERIANS LINED THIS BALUSTRADE AND FIRED
FROM ABOVE
THE INFANTRY MEN REPLYING FROM BELOW SIX AGAINST TWO
HUNDRED INTREPID AND WITH NO SHELTER SAVE THE CURRANT BUSHES TOOK A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO DIE
ONE MOUNTS A FEW STEPS AND PASSES FROM THE GARDEN INTO THE ORCHARD
PROPERLY SPEAKING
THERE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THOSE FEW SQUARE FATHOMS
FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN FELL IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
THE WALL SEEMS READY
TO RENEW THE COMBAT
THIRTY EIGHT LOOPHOLES PIERCED BY THE ENGLISH AT
IRREGULAR HEIGHTS ARE THERE STILL
IN FRONT OF THE SIXTH ARE PLACED TWO
ENGLISH TOMBS OF GRANITE
THERE ARE LOOPHOLES ONLY IN THE SOUTH WALL AS
THE PRINCIPAL ATTACK CAME FROM THAT QUARTER
THE WALL IS HIDDEN ON THE
OUTSIDE BY A TALL HEDGE THE FRENCH CAME UP THINKING THAT THEY HAD TO
DEAL ONLY WITH A HEDGE CROSSED IT AND FOUND THE WALL BOTH AN OBSTACLE
AND AN AMBUSCADE WITH THE ENGLISH GUARDS BEHIND IT THE THIRTY EIGHT
LOOPHOLES FIRING AT ONCE A SHOWER OF GRAPE SHOT AND BALLS AND SOYE'S
BRIGADE WAS BROKEN AGAINST IT
THUS WATERLOO BEGAN
NEVERTHELESS THE ORCHARD WAS TAKEN
AS THEY HAD NO LADDERS THE FRENCH
SCALED IT WITH THEIR NAILS
THEY FOUGHT HAND TO HAND AMID THE TREES
ALL THIS GRASS HAS BEEN SOAKED IN BLOOD
A BATTALION OF NASSAU SEVEN
HUNDRED STRONG WAS OVERWHELMED THERE
THE OUTSIDE OF THE WALL AGAINST
WHICH KELLERMANN'S TWO BATTERIES WERE TRAINED IS GNAWED BY GRAPE SHOT
THIS ORCHARD IS SENTIENT LIKE OTHERS IN THE MONTH OF MAY
IT HAS ITS
BUTTERCUPS AND ITS DAISIES THE GRASS IS TALL THERE THE CART HORSES
BROWSE THERE CORDS OF HAIR ON WHICH LINEN IS DRYING TRAVERSE THE
SPACES BETWEEN THE TREES AND FORCE THE PASSER BY TO BEND HIS HEAD ONE
WALKS OVER THIS UNCULTIVATED LAND AND ONE'S FOOT DIVES INTO MOLE HOLES
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GRASS ONE OBSERVES AN UPROOTED TREE BOLE WHICH LIES
THERE ALL VERDANT
MAJOR BLACKMANN LEANED AGAINST IT TO DIE
BENEATH
A GREAT TREE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FELL THE GERMAN GENERAL DUPLAT
DESCENDED FROM A FRENCH FAMILY WHICH FLED ON THE REVOCATION OF THE EDICT
OF NANTES
AN AGED AND FALLING APPLE TREE LEANS FAR OVER TO ONE SIDE
ITS WOUND DRESSED WITH A BANDAGE OF STRAW AND OF CLAYEY LOAM
NEARLY ALL
THE APPLE TREES ARE FALLING WITH AGE
THERE IS NOT ONE WHICH HAS NOT
HAD ITS BULLET OR ITS BISCAYAN 6 THE SKELETONS OF DEAD TREES ABOUND IN
THIS ORCHARD
CROWS FLY THROUGH THEIR BRANCHES AND AT THE END OF IT IS
A WOOD FULL OF VIOLETS
BAUDUIN KILLED FOY WOUNDED CONFLAGRATION MASSACRE CARNAGE A
RIVULET FORMED OF ENGLISH BLOOD FRENCH BLOOD GERMAN BLOOD MINGLED
IN FURY A WELL CRAMMED WITH CORPSES THE REGIMENT OF NASSAU AND THE
REGIMENT OF BRUNSWICK DESTROYED DUPLAT KILLED BLACKMANN KILLED THE
ENGLISH GUARDS MUTILATED TWENTY FRENCH BATTALIONS BESIDES THE FORTY
FROM REILLE'S CORPS DECIMATED THREE THOUSAND MEN IN THAT HOVEL OF
HOUGOMONT ALONE CUT DOWN SLASHED TO PIECES SHOT BURNED WITH THEIR
THROATS CUT AND ALL THIS SO THAT A PEASANT CAN SAY TO DAY TO THE
TRAVELLER MONSIEUR GIVE ME THREE FRANCS AND IF YOU LIKE I WILL
EXPLAIN TO YOU THE AFFAIR OF WATERLOO
CHAPTER III THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE 1815
LET US TURN BACK THAT IS ONE OF THE STORY TELLER'S RIGHTS AND PUT
OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE YEAR 1815 AND EVEN A LITTLE EARLIER THAN
THE EPOCH WHEN THE ACTION NARRATED IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS BOOK TOOK
PLACE
IF IT HAD NOT RAINED IN THE NIGHT BETWEEN THE 17TH AND THE 18TH OF
JUNE 1815 THE FATE OF EUROPE WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
A FEW DROPS
OF WATER MORE OR LESS DECIDED THE DOWNFALL OF NAPOLEON
ALL THAT
PROVIDENCE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MAKE WATERLOO THE END OF AUSTERLITZ
WAS A LITTLE MORE RAIN AND A CLOUD TRAVERSING THE SKY OUT OF SEASON
SUFFICED TO MAKE A WORLD CRUMBLE
THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO COULD NOT BE BEGUN UNTIL HALF PAST ELEVEN
O'CLOCK AND THAT GAVE BLUCHER TIME TO COME UP
WHY BECAUSE THE GROUND
WAS WET
THE ARTILLERY HAD TO WAIT UNTIL IT BECAME A LITTLE FIRMER
BEFORE THEY COULD MANOEUVRE
NAPOLEON WAS AN ARTILLERY OFFICER AND FELT THE EFFECTS OF THIS
THE
FOUNDATION OF THIS WONDERFUL CAPTAIN WAS THE MAN WHO IN THE REPORT TO
THE DIRECTORY ON ABOUKIR SAID SUCH A ONE OF OUR BALLS KILLED SIX MEN
ALL HIS PLANS OF BATTLE WERE ARRANGED FOR PROJECTILES
THE KEY TO HIS
VICTORY WAS TO MAKE THE ARTILLERY CONVERGE ON ONE POINT
HE TREATED THE
STRATEGY OF THE HOSTILE GENERAL LIKE A CITADEL AND MADE A BREACH IN IT
HE OVERWHELMED THE WEAK POINT WITH GRAPE SHOT HE JOINED AND DISSOLVED
BATTLES WITH CANNON
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THE SHARPSHOOTER IN HIS
GENIUS
TO BEAT IN SQUARES TO PULVERIZE REGIMENTS TO BREAK LINES TO
CRUSH AND DISPERSE MASSES FOR HIM EVERYTHING LAY IN THIS TO
STRIKE STRIKE STRIKE INCESSANTLY AND HE INTRUSTED THIS TASK TO THE
CANNON BALL
A REDOUBTABLE METHOD AND ONE WHICH UNITED WITH GENIUS
RENDERED THIS GLOOMY ATHLETE OF THE PUGILISM OF WAR INVINCIBLE FOR THE
SPACE OF FIFTEEN YEARS
ON THE 18TH OF JUNE 1815 HE RELIED ALL THE MORE ON HIS ARTILLERY
BECAUSE HE HAD NUMBERS ON HIS SIDE
WELLINGTON HAD ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND
FIFTY NINE MOUTHS OF FIRE NAPOLEON HAD TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY
SUPPOSE THE SOIL DRY AND THE ARTILLERY CAPABLE OF MOVING THE ACTION
WOULD HAVE BEGUN AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THE BATTLE WOULD HAVE
BEEN WON AND ENDED AT TWO O'CLOCK THREE HOURS BEFORE THE CHANGE OF
FORTUNE IN FAVOR OF THE PRUSSIANS
WHAT AMOUNT OF BLAME ATTACHES TO
NAPOLEON FOR THE LOSS OF THIS BATTLE IS THE SHIPWRECK DUE TO THE PILOT
WAS IT THE EVIDENT PHYSICAL DECLINE OF NAPOLEON THAT COMPLICATED THIS
EPOCH BY AN INWARD DIMINUTION OF FORCE HAD THE TWENTY YEARS OF WAR WORN
OUT THE BLADE AS IT HAD WORN THE SCABBARD THE SOUL AS WELL AS THE BODY
DID THE VETERAN MAKE HIMSELF DISASTROUSLY FELT IN THE LEADER IN A WORD
WAS THIS GENIUS AS MANY HISTORIANS OF NOTE HAVE THOUGHT SUFFERING FROM
AN ECLIPSE DID HE GO INTO A FRENZY IN ORDER TO DISGUISE HIS WEAKENED
POWERS FROM HIMSELF DID HE BEGIN TO WAVER UNDER THE DELUSION OF
A BREATH OF ADVENTURE HAD HE BECOME A GRAVE MATTER IN A
GENERAL UNCONSCIOUS OF PERIL IS THERE AN AGE IN THIS CLASS OF
MATERIAL GREAT MEN WHO MAY BE CALLED THE GIANTS OF ACTION WHEN GENIUS
GROWS SHORT SIGHTED OLD AGE HAS NO HOLD ON THE GENIUSES OF THE IDEAL
FOR THE DANTES AND MICHAEL ANGELOS TO GROW OLD IS TO GROW IN GREATNESS
IS IT TO GROW LESS FOR THE HANNIBALS AND THE BONAPARTES HAD NAPOLEON
LOST THE DIRECT SENSE OF VICTORY HAD HE REACHED THE POINT WHERE HE
COULD NO LONGER RECOGNIZE THE REEF COULD NO LONGER DIVINE THE SNARE NO
LONGER DISCERN THE CRUMBLING BRINK OF ABYSSES HAD HE LOST HIS POWER OF
SCENTING OUT CATASTROPHES HE WHO HAD IN FORMER DAYS KNOWN ALL THE
ROADS TO TRIUMPH AND WHO FROM THE SUMMIT OF HIS CHARIOT OF LIGHTNING
POINTED THEM OUT WITH A SOVEREIGN FINGER HAD HE NOW REACHED THAT
STATE OF SINISTER AMAZEMENT WHEN HE COULD LEAD HIS TUMULTUOUS LEGIONS
HARNESSED TO IT TO THE PRECIPICE WAS HE SEIZED AT THE AGE OF FORTY SIX
WITH A SUPREME MADNESS WAS THAT TITANIC CHARIOTEER OF DESTINY NO LONGER
ANYTHING MORE THAN AN IMMENSE DARE DEVIL
WE DO NOT THINK SO
HIS PLAN OF BATTLE WAS BY THE CONFESSION OF ALL A MASTERPIECE
TO
GO STRAIGHT TO THE CENTRE OF THE ALLIES' LINE TO MAKE A BREACH IN THE
ENEMY TO CUT THEM IN TWO TO DRIVE THE BRITISH HALF BACK ON HAL
AND THE PRUSSIAN HALF ON TONGRES TO MAKE TWO SHATTERED FRAGMENTS OF
WELLINGTON AND BLUCHER TO CARRY MONT SAINT JEAN TO SEIZE BRUSSELS
TO HURL THE GERMAN INTO THE RHINE AND THE ENGLISHMAN INTO THE SEA
ALL
THIS WAS CONTAINED IN THAT BATTLE ACCORDING TO NAPOLEON
AFTERWARDS
PEOPLE WOULD SEE
OF COURSE WE DO NOT HERE PRETEND TO FURNISH A HISTORY OF THE BATTLE OF
WATERLOO ONE OF THE SCENES OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE STORY WHICH WE
ARE RELATING IS CONNECTED WITH THIS BATTLE BUT THIS HISTORY IS NOT OUR
SUBJECT THIS HISTORY MOREOVER HAS BEEN FINISHED AND FINISHED IN A
MASTERLY MANNER FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW BY NAPOLEON AND FROM ANOTHER
POINT OF VIEW BY A WHOLE PLEIAD OF HISTORIANS 7
AS FOR US WE LEAVE THE HISTORIANS AT LOGGERHEADS WE ARE BUT A DISTANT
WITNESS A PASSER BY ON THE PLAIN A SEEKER BENDING OVER THAT SOIL ALL
MADE OF HUMAN FLESH TAKING APPEARANCES FOR REALITIES PERCHANCE WE
HAVE NO RIGHT TO OPPOSE IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE A COLLECTION OF FACTS
WHICH CONTAIN ILLUSIONS NO DOUBT WE POSSESS NEITHER MILITARY PRACTICE
NOR STRATEGIC ABILITY WHICH AUTHORIZE A SYSTEM IN OUR OPINION A CHAIN
OF ACCIDENTS DOMINATED THE TWO LEADERS AT WATERLOO AND WHEN IT BECOMES
A QUESTION OF DESTINY THAT MYSTERIOUS CULPRIT WE JUDGE LIKE THAT
INGENIOUS JUDGE THE POPULACE
CHAPTER IV A
THOSE PERSONS WHO WISH TO GAIN A CLEAR IDEA OF THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO
HAVE ONLY TO PLACE MENTALLY ON THE GROUND A CAPITAL A
THE LEFT LIMB
OF THE A IS THE ROAD TO NIVELLES THE RIGHT LIMB IS THE ROAD TO GENAPPE
THE TIE OF THE A IS THE HOLLOW ROAD TO OHAIN FROM BRAINE L'ALLEUD
THE
TOP OF THE A IS MONT SAINT JEAN WHERE WELLINGTON IS THE LOWER LEFT TIP
IS HOUGOMONT WHERE REILLE IS STATIONED WITH JEROME BONAPARTE THE RIGHT
TIP IS THE BELLE ALLIANCE WHERE NAPOLEON WAS
AT THE CENTRE OF THIS
CHORD IS THE PRECISE POINT WHERE THE FINAL WORD OF THE BATTLE WAS
PRONOUNCED
IT WAS THERE THAT THE LION HAS BEEN PLACED THE INVOLUNTARY
SYMBOL OF THE SUPREME HEROISM OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD
THE TRIANGLE INCLUDED IN THE TOP OF THE A BETWEEN THE TWO LIMBS AND THE
TIE IS THE PLATEAU OF MONT SAINT JEAN
THE DISPUTE OVER THIS PLATEAU
CONSTITUTED THE WHOLE BATTLE
THE WINGS OF THE TWO ARMIES EXTENDED TO
THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE TWO ROADS TO GENAPPE AND NIVELLES D'ERLON
FACING PICTON REILLE FACING HILL
BEHIND THE TIP OF THE A BEHIND THE PLATEAU OF MONT SAINT JEAN IS THE
FOREST OF SOIGNES
AS FOR THE PLAIN ITSELF LET THE READER PICTURE TO HIMSELF A VAST
UNDULATING SWEEP OF GROUND EACH RISE COMMANDS THE NEXT RISE AND ALL
THE UNDULATIONS MOUNT TOWARDS MONT SAINT JEAN AND THERE END IN THE
FOREST
TWO HOSTILE TROOPS ON A FIELD OF BATTLE ARE TWO WRESTLERS
IT IS A
QUESTION OF SEIZING THE OPPONENT ROUND THE WAIST
THE ONE SEEKS TO TRIP
UP THE OTHER
THEY CLUTCH AT EVERYTHING A BUSH IS A POINT OF SUPPORT
AN ANGLE OF THE WALL OFFERS THEM A REST TO THE SHOULDER FOR THE LACK
OF A HOVEL UNDER WHOSE COVER THEY CAN DRAW UP A REGIMENT YIELDS ITS
GROUND AN UNEVENNESS IN THE GROUND A CHANCE TURN IN THE LANDSCAPE A
CROSS PATH ENCOUNTERED AT THE RIGHT MOMENT A GROVE A RAVINE CAN
STAY THE HEEL OF THAT COLOSSUS WHICH IS CALLED AN ARMY AND PREVENT ITS
RETREAT
HE WHO QUITS THE FIELD IS BEATEN HENCE THE NECESSITY DEVOLVING
ON THE RESPONSIBLE LEADER OF EXAMINING THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT CLUMP OF
TREES AND OF STUDYING DEEPLY THE SLIGHTEST RELIEF IN THE GROUND
THE TWO GENERALS HAD ATTENTIVELY STUDIED THE PLAIN OF MONT SAINT JEAN
NOW CALLED THE PLAIN OF WATERLOO
IN THE PRECEDING YEAR WELLINGTON
WITH THE SAGACITY OF FORESIGHT HAD EXAMINED IT AS THE POSSIBLE SEAT OF
A GREAT BATTLE
UPON THIS SPOT AND FOR THIS DUEL ON THE 18TH OF JUNE
WELLINGTON HAD THE GOOD POST NAPOLEON THE BAD POST
THE ENGLISH ARMY
WAS STATIONED ABOVE THE FRENCH ARMY BELOW
IT IS ALMOST SUPERFLUOUS HERE TO SKETCH THE APPEARANCE OF NAPOLEON ON
HORSEBACK GLASS IN HAND UPON THE HEIGHTS OF ROSSOMME AT DAYBREAK ON
JUNE 18 1815
ALL THE WORLD HAS SEEN HIM BEFORE WE CAN SHOW HIM
THAT CALM PROFILE UNDER THE LITTLE THREE CORNERED HAT OF THE SCHOOL OF
BRIENNE THAT GREEN UNIFORM THE WHITE REVERS CONCEALING THE STAR OF THE
LEGION OF HONOR HIS GREAT COAT HIDING HIS EPAULETS THE CORNER OF RED
RIBBON PEEPING FROM BENEATH HIS VEST HIS LEATHER TROUSERS THE WHITE
HORSE WITH THE SADDLE CLOTH OF PURPLE VELVET BEARING ON THE CORNERS
CROWNED N'S AND EAGLES HESSIAN BOOTS OVER SILK STOCKINGS SILVER SPURS
THE SWORD OF MARENGO THAT WHOLE FIGURE OF THE LAST OF THE CAESARS IS
PRESENT TO ALL IMAGINATIONS SALUTED WITH ACCLAMATIONS BY SOME SEVERELY
REGARDED BY OTHERS
THAT FIGURE STOOD FOR A LONG TIME WHOLLY IN THE LIGHT THIS AROSE FROM
A CERTAIN LEGENDARY DIMNESS EVOLVED BY THE MAJORITY OF HEROES AND WHICH
ALWAYS VEILS THE TRUTH FOR A LONGER OR SHORTER TIME BUT TO DAY HISTORY
AND DAYLIGHT HAVE ARRIVED
THAT LIGHT CALLED HISTORY IS PITILESS IT POSSESSES THIS PECULIAR AND
DIVINE QUALITY THAT PURE LIGHT AS IT IS AND PRECISELY BECAUSE IT
IS WHOLLY LIGHT IT OFTEN CASTS A SHADOW IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE HAD
HITHERTO BEHELD RAYS FROM THE SAME MAN IT CONSTRUCTS TWO DIFFERENT
PHANTOMS AND THE ONE ATTACKS THE OTHER AND EXECUTES JUSTICE ON IT AND
THE SHADOWS OF THE DESPOT CONTEND WITH THE BRILLIANCY OF THE LEADER
HENCE ARISES A TRUER MEASURE IN THE DEFINITIVE JUDGMENTS OF NATIONS
BABYLON VIOLATED LESSENS ALEXANDER ROME ENCHAINED LESSENS CAESAR
JERUSALEM MURDERED LESSENS TITUS TYRANNY FOLLOWS THE TYRANT
IT IS A
MISFORTUNE FOR A MAN TO LEAVE BEHIND HIM THE NIGHT WHICH BEARS HIS FORM
CHAPTER V THE QUID OBSCURUM OF BATTLES
EVERY ONE IS ACQUAINTED WITH THE FIRST PHASE OF THIS BATTLE A BEGINNING
WHICH WAS TROUBLED UNCERTAIN HESITATING MENACING TO BOTH ARMIES BUT
STILL MORE SO FOR THE ENGLISH THAN FOR THE FRENCH
IT HAD RAINED ALL NIGHT THE EARTH HAD BEEN CUT UP BY THE DOWNPOUR THE
WATER HAD ACCUMULATED HERE AND THERE IN THE HOLLOWS OF THE PLAIN AS IF
IN CASKS AT SOME POINTS THE GEAR OF THE ARTILLERY CARRIAGES WAS BURIED
UP TO THE AXLES THE CIRCINGLES OF THE HORSES WERE DRIPPING WITH LIQUID
MUD
IF THE WHEAT AND RYE TRAMPLED DOWN BY THIS COHORT OF TRANSPORTS
ON THE MARCH HAD NOT FILLED IN THE RUTS AND STREWN A LITTER BENEATH THE
WHEELS ALL MOVEMENT PARTICULARLY IN THE VALLEYS IN THE DIRECTION OF
PAPELOTTE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE
THE AFFAIR BEGAN LATE
NAPOLEON AS WE HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED WAS IN
THE HABIT OF KEEPING ALL HIS ARTILLERY WELL IN HAND LIKE A PISTOL
AIMING IT NOW AT ONE POINT NOW AT ANOTHER OF THE BATTLE AND IT HAD
BEEN HIS WISH TO WAIT UNTIL THE HORSE BATTERIES COULD MOVE AND GALLOP
FREELY
IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE SUN SHOULD COME
OUT AND DRY THE SOIL
BUT THE SUN DID NOT MAKE ITS APPEARANCE
IT WAS
NO LONGER THE RENDEZVOUS OF AUSTERLITZ
WHEN THE FIRST CANNON WAS FIRED
THE ENGLISH GENERAL COLVILLE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND NOTED THAT IT
WAS THIRTY FIVE MINUTES PAST ELEVEN
THE ACTION WAS BEGUN FURIOUSLY WITH MORE FURY PERHAPS THAN THE
EMPEROR WOULD HAVE WISHED BY THE LEFT WING OF THE FRENCH RESTING ON
HOUGOMONT
AT THE SAME TIME NAPOLEON ATTACKED THE CENTRE BY HURLING
QUIOT'S BRIGADE ON LA HAIE SAINTE AND NEY PUSHED FORWARD THE RIGHT
WING OF THE FRENCH AGAINST THE LEFT WING OF THE ENGLISH WHICH RESTED ON
PAPELOTTE
THE ATTACK ON HOUGOMONT WAS SOMETHING OF A FEINT THE PLAN WAS TO DRAW
WELLINGTON THITHER AND TO MAKE HIM SWERVE TO THE LEFT
THIS PLAN WOULD
HAVE SUCCEEDED IF THE FOUR COMPANIES OF THE ENGLISH GUARDS AND THE BRAVE
BELGIANS OF PERPONCHER'S DIVISION HAD NOT HELD THE POSITION SOLIDLY AND
WELLINGTON INSTEAD OF MASSING HIS TROOPS THERE COULD CONFINE HIMSELF
TO DESPATCHING THITHER AS REINFORCEMENTS ONLY FOUR MORE COMPANIES OF
GUARDS AND ONE BATTALION FROM BRUNSWICK
THE ATTACK OF THE RIGHT WING OF THE FRENCH ON PAPELOTTE WAS CALCULATED
IN FACT TO OVERTHROW THE ENGLISH LEFT TO CUT OFF THE ROAD TO BRUSSELS
TO BAR THE PASSAGE AGAINST POSSIBLE PRUSSIANS TO FORCE MONT SAINT JEAN
TO TURN WELLINGTON BACK ON HOUGOMONT THENCE ON BRAINE L'ALLEUD THENCE
ON HAL NOTHING EASIER
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW INCIDENTS THIS
ATTACK SUCCEEDED PAPELOTTE WAS TAKEN LA HAIE SAINTE WAS CARRIED
A DETAIL TO BE NOTED
THERE WAS IN THE ENGLISH INFANTRY PARTICULARLY
IN KEMPT'S BRIGADE A GREAT MANY RAW RECRUITS
THESE YOUNG SOLDIERS WERE
VALIANT IN THE PRESENCE OF OUR REDOUBTABLE INFANTRY THEIR INEXPERIENCE
EXTRICATED THEM INTREPIDLY FROM THE DILEMMA THEY PERFORMED PARTICULARLY
EXCELLENT SERVICE AS SKIRMISHERS THE SOLDIER SKIRMISHER LEFT SOMEWHAT
TO HIMSELF BECOMES SO TO SPEAK HIS OWN GENERAL
THESE RECRUITS
DISPLAYED SOME OF THE FRENCH INGENUITY AND FURY
THIS NOVICE OF AN
INFANTRY HAD DASH
THIS DISPLEASED WELLINGTON
AFTER THE TAKING OF LA HAIE SAINTE THE BATTLE WAVERED
THERE IS IN THIS DAY AN OBSCURE INTERVAL FROM MID DAY TO FOUR O'CLOCK
THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THIS BATTLE IS ALMOST INDISTINCT AND PARTICIPATES
IN THE SOMBRENESS OF THE HAND TO HAND CONFLICT
TWILIGHT REIGNS OVER IT
WE PERCEIVE VAST FLUCTUATIONS IN THAT FOG A DIZZY MIRAGE PARAPHERNALIA
OF WAR ALMOST UNKNOWN TO DAY PENDANT COLBACKS FLOATING SABRE TACHES
CROSS BELTS CARTRIDGE BOXES FOR GRENADES HUSSAR DOLMANS RED BOOTS
WITH A THOUSAND WRINKLES HEAVY SHAKOS GARLANDED WITH TORSADES THE
ALMOST BLACK INFANTRY OF BRUNSWICK MINGLED WITH THE SCARLET INFANTRY
OF ENGLAND THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS WITH GREAT WHITE CIRCULAR PADS ON THE
SLOPES OF THEIR SHOULDERS FOR EPAULETS THE HANOVERIAN LIGHT HORSE WITH
THEIR OBLONG CASQUES OF LEATHER WITH BRASS HANDS AND RED HORSE TAILS
THE SCOTCH WITH THEIR BARE KNEES AND PLAIDS THE GREAT WHITE GAITERS
OF OUR GRENADIERS PICTURES NOT STRATEGIC LINES WHAT SALVATOR ROSA
REQUIRES NOT WHAT IS SUITED TO THE NEEDS OF GRIBEAUVAL
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TEMPEST IS ALWAYS MINGLED WITH A BATTLE
QUID
OBSCURUM QUID DIVINUM
EACH HISTORIAN TRACES TO SOME EXTENT THE
PARTICULAR FEATURE WHICH PLEASES HIM AMID THIS PELL MELL
WHATEVER MAY
BE THE COMBINATIONS OF THE GENERALS THE SHOCK OF ARMED MASSES HAS AN
INCALCULABLE EBB
DURING THE ACTION THE PLANS OF THE TWO LEADERS ENTER
INTO EACH OTHER AND BECOME MUTUALLY THROWN OUT OF SHAPE
SUCH A POINT OF
THE FIELD OF BATTLE DEVOURS MORE COMBATANTS THAN SUCH ANOTHER JUST AS
MORE OR LESS SPONGY SOILS SOAK UP MORE OR LESS QUICKLY THE WATER WHICH
IS POURED ON THEM
IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO POUR OUT MORE SOLDIERS THAN
ONE WOULD LIKE A SERIES OF EXPENDITURES WHICH ARE THE UNFORESEEN
THE
LINE OF BATTLE WAVES AND UNDULATES LIKE A THREAD THE TRAILS OF BLOOD
GUSH ILLOGICALLY THE FRONTS OF THE ARMIES WAVER THE REGIMENTS
FORM CAPES AND GULFS AS THEY ENTER AND WITHDRAW ALL THESE REEFS ARE
CONTINUALLY MOVING IN FRONT OF EACH OTHER
WHERE THE INFANTRY STOOD THE
ARTILLERY ARRIVES THE CAVALRY RUSHES IN WHERE THE ARTILLERY WAS THE
BATTALIONS ARE LIKE SMOKE
THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE SEEK IT
IT HAS
DISAPPEARED THE OPEN SPOTS CHANGE PLACE THE SOMBRE FOLDS ADVANCE AND
RETREAT A SORT OF WIND FROM THE SEPULCHRE PUSHES FORWARD HURLS BACK
DISTENDS AND DISPERSES THESE TRAGIC MULTITUDES
WHAT IS A FRAY AN
OSCILLATION THE IMMOBILITY OF A MATHEMATICAL PLAN EXPRESSES A MINUTE
NOT A DAY
IN ORDER TO DEPICT A BATTLE THERE IS REQUIRED ONE OF THOSE
POWERFUL PAINTERS WHO HAVE CHAOS IN THEIR BRUSHES
REMBRANDT IS BETTER
THAN VANDERMEULEN VANDERMEULEN EXACT AT NOON LIES AT THREE O'CLOCK
GEOMETRY IS DECEPTIVE THE HURRICANE ALONE IS TRUSTWORTHY
THAT IS WHAT
CONFERS ON FOLARD THE RIGHT TO CONTRADICT POLYBIUS
LET US ADD THAT
THERE IS A CERTAIN INSTANT WHEN THE BATTLE DEGENERATES INTO A COMBAT
BECOMES SPECIALIZED AND DISPERSES INTO INNUMERABLE DETAILED FEATS
WHICH TO BORROW THE EXPRESSION OF NAPOLEON HIMSELF BELONG RATHER TO
THE BIOGRAPHY OF THE REGIMENTS THAN TO THE HISTORY OF THE ARMY THE
HISTORIAN HAS IN THIS CASE THE EVIDENT RIGHT TO SUM UP THE WHOLE
HE
CANNOT DO MORE THAN SEIZE THE PRINCIPAL OUTLINES OF THE STRUGGLE AND
IT IS NOT GIVEN TO ANY ONE NARRATOR HOWEVER CONSCIENTIOUS HE MAY BE
TO FIX ABSOLUTELY THE FORM OF THAT HORRIBLE CLOUD WHICH IS CALLED A
BATTLE
THIS WHICH IS TRUE OF ALL GREAT ARMED ENCOUNTERS IS PARTICULARLY
APPLICABLE TO WATERLOO
NEVERTHELESS AT A CERTAIN MOMENT IN THE AFTERNOON THE BATTLE CAME TO A
POINT
CHAPTER VI FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
TOWARDS FOUR O'CLOCK THE CONDITION OF THE ENGLISH ARMY WAS SERIOUS
THE
PRINCE OF ORANGE WAS IN COMMAND OF THE CENTRE HILL OF THE RIGHT WING
PICTON OF THE LEFT WING
THE PRINCE OF ORANGE DESPERATE AND INTREPID
SHOUTED TO THE HOLLANDO BELGIANS NASSAU BRUNSWICK NEVER RETREAT
HILL HAVING BEEN WEAKENED HAD COME UP TO THE SUPPORT OF WELLINGTON
PICTON WAS DEAD
AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE ENGLISH HAD CAPTURED FROM
THE FRENCH THE FLAG OF THE 105TH OF THE LINE THE FRENCH HAD KILLED THE
ENGLISH GENERAL PICTON WITH A BULLET THROUGH THE HEAD
THE BATTLE
HAD FOR WELLINGTON TWO BASES OF ACTION HOUGOMONT AND LA HAIE SAINTE
HOUGOMONT STILL HELD OUT BUT WAS ON FIRE LA HAIE SAINTE WAS TAKEN
OF
THE GERMAN BATTALION WHICH DEFENDED IT ONLY FORTY TWO MEN SURVIVED ALL
THE OFFICERS EXCEPT FIVE WERE EITHER DEAD OR CAPTURED
THREE THOUSAND
COMBATANTS HAD BEEN MASSACRED IN THAT BARN
A SERGEANT OF THE ENGLISH
GUARDS THE FOREMOST BOXER IN ENGLAND REPUTED INVULNERABLE BY HIS
COMPANIONS HAD BEEN KILLED THERE BY A LITTLE FRENCH DRUMMER BOY
BARING
HAD BEEN DISLODGED ALTEN PUT TO THE SWORD
MANY FLAGS HAD BEEN LOST
ONE FROM ALTEN'S DIVISION AND ONE FROM THE BATTALION OF LUNENBURG
CARRIED BY A PRINCE OF THE HOUSE OF DEUX PONTS
THE SCOTCH GRAYS NO
LONGER EXISTED PONSONBY'S GREAT DRAGOONS HAD BEEN HACKED TO PIECES
THAT VALIANT CAVALRY HAD BENT BENEATH THE LANCERS OF BRO AND BENEATH
THE CUIRASSIERS OF TRAVERS OUT OF TWELVE HUNDRED HORSES SIX
HUNDRED REMAINED OUT OF THREE LIEUTENANT COLONELS TWO LAY ON THE
EARTH HAMILTON WOUNDED MATER SLAIN
PONSONBY HAD FALLEN RIDDLED BY
SEVEN LANCE THRUSTS
GORDON WAS DEAD
MARSH WAS DEAD
TWO DIVISIONS THE
FIFTH AND THE SIXTH HAD BEEN ANNIHILATED
HOUGOMONT INJURED LA HAIE SAINTE TAKEN THERE NOW EXISTED BUT ONE
RALLYING POINT THE CENTRE
THAT POINT STILL HELD FIRM
WELLINGTON
REINFORCED IT
HE SUMMONED THITHER HILL WHO WAS AT MERLE BRAINE HE
SUMMONED CHASSE WHO WAS AT BRAINE L'ALLEUD
THE CENTRE OF THE ENGLISH ARMY RATHER CONCAVE VERY DENSE AND
VERY COMPACT WAS STRONGLY POSTED
IT OCCUPIED THE PLATEAU OF
MONT SAINT JEAN HAVING BEHIND IT THE VILLAGE AND IN FRONT OF IT THE
SLOPE WHICH WAS TOLERABLY STEEP THEN
IT RESTED ON THAT STOUT STONE
DWELLING WHICH AT THAT TIME BELONGED TO THE DOMAIN OF NIVELLES AND
WHICH MARKS THE INTERSECTION OF THE ROADS A PILE OF THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY AND SO ROBUST THAT THE CANNON BALLS REBOUNDED FROM IT WITHOUT
INJURING IT
ALL ABOUT THE PLATEAU THE ENGLISH HAD CUT THE HEDGES HERE
AND THERE MADE EMBRASURES IN THE HAWTHORN TREES THRUST THE THROAT OF
A CANNON BETWEEN TWO BRANCHES EMBATTLED THE SHRUBS
THERE ARTILLERY WAS
AMBUSHED IN THE BRUSHWOOD
THIS PUNIC LABOR INCONTESTABLY AUTHORIZED
BY WAR WHICH PERMITS TRAPS WAS SO WELL DONE THAT HAXO WHO HAD BEEN
DESPATCHED BY THE EMPEROR AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO RECONNOITRE
THE ENEMY'S BATTERIES HAD DISCOVERED NOTHING OF IT AND HAD RETURNED
AND REPORTED TO NAPOLEON THAT THERE WERE NO OBSTACLES EXCEPT THE TWO
BARRICADES WHICH BARRED THE ROAD TO NIVELLES AND TO GENAPPE
IT WAS
AT THE SEASON WHEN THE GRAIN IS TALL ON THE EDGE OF THE PLATEAU A
BATTALION OF KEMPT'S BRIGADE THE 95TH ARMED WITH CARABINES WAS
CONCEALED IN THE TALL WHEAT
THUS ASSURED AND BUTTRESSED THE CENTRE OF THE ANGLO DUTCH ARMY WAS WELL
POSTED
THE PERIL OF THIS POSITION LAY IN THE FOREST OF SOIGNES
THEN ADJOINING THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND INTERSECTED BY THE PONDS OF
GROENENDAEL AND BOITSFORT
AN ARMY COULD NOT RETREAT THITHER WITHOUT
DISSOLVING THE REGIMENTS WOULD HAVE BROKEN UP IMMEDIATELY THERE
THE ARTILLERY WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST AMONG THE MORASSES
THE RETREAT
ACCORDING TO MANY A MAN VERSED IN THE ART THOUGH IT IS DISPUTED BY
OTHERS WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISORGANIZED FLIGHT
TO THIS CENTRE WELLINGTON ADDED ONE OF CHASSE'S BRIGADES TAKEN FROM THE
RIGHT WING AND ONE OF WINCKE'S BRIGADES TAKEN FROM THE LEFT WING PLUS
CLINTON'S DIVISION
TO HIS ENGLISH TO THE REGIMENTS OF HALKETT TO
THE BRIGADES OF MITCHELL TO THE GUARDS OF MAITLAND HE GAVE AS
REINFORCEMENTS AND AIDS THE INFANTRY OF BRUNSWICK NASSAU'S CONTINGENT
KIELMANSEGG'S HANOVERIANS AND OMPTEDA'S GERMANS
THIS PLACED TWENTY SIX
BATTALIONS UNDER HIS HAND
THE RIGHT WING AS CHARRAS SAYS WAS THROWN
BACK ON THE CENTRE
AN ENORMOUS BATTERY WAS MASKED BY SACKS OF EARTH AT
THE SPOT WHERE THERE NOW STANDS WHAT IS CALLED THE MUSEUM OF WATERLOO
BESIDES THIS WELLINGTON HAD BEHIND A RISE IN THE GROUND SOMERSET'S
DRAGOON GUARDS FOURTEEN HUNDRED HORSE STRONG
IT WAS THE REMAINING HALF
OF THE JUSTLY CELEBRATED ENGLISH CAVALRY
PONSONBY DESTROYED SOMERSET
REMAINED
THE BATTERY WHICH IF COMPLETED WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST A REDOUBT WAS
RANGED BEHIND A VERY LOW GARDEN WALL BACKED UP WITH A COATING OF BAGS
OF SAND AND A LARGE SLOPE OF EARTH
THIS WORK WAS NOT FINISHED THERE
HAD BEEN NO TIME TO MAKE A PALISADE FOR IT
WELLINGTON UNEASY BUT IMPASSIVE WAS ON HORSEBACK AND THERE REMAINED
THE WHOLE DAY IN THE SAME ATTITUDE A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF THE OLD MILL
OF MONT SAINT JEAN WHICH IS STILL IN EXISTENCE BENEATH AN ELM WHICH
AN ENGLISHMAN AN ENTHUSIASTIC VANDAL PURCHASED LATER ON FOR TWO
HUNDRED FRANCS CUT DOWN AND CARRIED OFF
WELLINGTON WAS COLDLY HEROIC
THE BULLETS RAINED ABOUT HIM
HIS AIDE DE CAMP GORDON FELL AT HIS
SIDE
LORD HILL POINTING TO A SHELL WHICH HAD BURST SAID TO HIM MY
LORD WHAT ARE YOUR ORDERS IN CASE YOU ARE KILLED TO DO LIKE ME
REPLIED WELLINGTON
TO CLINTON HE SAID LACONICALLY TO HOLD THIS SPOT
TO THE LAST MAN THE DAY WAS EVIDENTLY TURNING OUT ILL
WELLINGTON
SHOUTED TO HIS OLD COMPANIONS OF TALAVERA OF VITTORIA OF SALAMANCA
BOYS CAN RETREAT BE THOUGHT OF THINK OF OLD ENGLAND
TOWARDS FOUR O'CLOCK THE ENGLISH LINE DREW BACK
SUDDENLY NOTHING
WAS VISIBLE ON THE CREST OF THE PLATEAU EXCEPT THE ARTILLERY AND THE
SHARPSHOOTERS THE REST HAD DISAPPEARED THE REGIMENTS DISLODGED BY
THE SHELLS AND THE FRENCH BULLETS RETREATED INTO THE BOTTOM NOW
INTERSECTED BY THE BACK ROAD OF THE FARM OF MONT SAINT JEAN A
RETROGRADE MOVEMENT TOOK PLACE THE ENGLISH FRONT HID ITSELF WELLINGTON
DREW BACK
THE BEGINNING OF RETREAT CRIED NAPOLEON
CHAPTER VII NAPOLEON IN A GOOD HUMOR
THE EMPEROR THOUGH ILL AND DISCOMMODED ON HORSEBACK BY A LOCAL TROUBLE
HAD NEVER BEEN IN A BETTER HUMOR THAN ON THAT DAY
HIS IMPENETRABILITY
HAD BEEN SMILING EVER SINCE THE MORNING
ON THE 18TH OF JUNE THAT
PROFOUND SOUL MASKED BY MARBLE BEAMED BLINDLY
THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN
GLOOMY AT AUSTERLITZ WAS GAY AT WATERLOO
THE GREATEST FAVORITES OF
DESTINY MAKE MISTAKES
OUR JOYS ARE COMPOSED OF SHADOW
THE SUPREME
SMILE IS GOD'S ALONE
RIDET CAESAR POMPEIUS FLEBIT SAID THE LEGIONARIES OF THE FULMINATRIX
LEGION
POMPEY WAS NOT DESTINED TO WEEP ON THAT OCCASION BUT IT IS
CERTAIN THAT CAESAR LAUGHED
WHILE EXPLORING ON HORSEBACK AT ONE O'CLOCK
ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT IN STORM AND RAIN IN COMPANY WITH BERTRAND THE
COMMUNES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROSSOMME SATISFIED AT THE SIGHT OF THE
LONG LINE OF THE ENGLISH CAMP FIRES ILLUMINATING THE WHOLE HORIZON FROM
FRISCHEMONT TO BRAINE L'ALLEUD IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM THAT FATE TO
WHOM HE HAD ASSIGNED A DAY ON THE FIELD OF WATERLOO WAS EXACT TO
THE APPOINTMENT HE STOPPED HIS HORSE AND REMAINED FOR SOME TIME
MOTIONLESS GAZING AT THE LIGHTNING AND LISTENING TO THE THUNDER
AND THIS FATALIST WAS HEARD TO CAST INTO THE DARKNESS THIS MYSTERIOUS
SAYING WE ARE IN ACCORD NAPOLEON WAS MISTAKEN
THEY WERE NO LONGER
IN ACCORD
HE TOOK NOT A MOMENT FOR SLEEP EVERY INSTANT OF THAT NIGHT WAS MARKED
BY A JOY FOR HIM
HE TRAVERSED THE LINE OF THE PRINCIPAL OUTPOSTS
HALTING HERE AND THERE TO TALK TO THE SENTINELS
AT HALF PAST TWO NEAR
THE WOOD OF HOUGOMONT HE HEARD THE TREAD OF A COLUMN ON THE MARCH HE
THOUGHT AT THE MOMENT THAT IT WAS A RETREAT ON THE PART OF WELLINGTON
HE SAID IT IS THE REAR GUARD OF THE ENGLISH GETTING UNDER WAY FOR THE
PURPOSE OF DECAMPING
I WILL TAKE PRISONERS THE SIX THOUSAND ENGLISH WHO
HAVE JUST ARRIVED AT OSTEND HE CONVERSED EXPANSIVELY HE REGAINED THE
ANIMATION WHICH HE HAD SHOWN AT HIS LANDING ON THE FIRST OF MARCH WHEN
HE POINTED OUT TO THE GRAND MARSHAL THE ENTHUSIASTIC PEASANT OF THE GULF
JUAN AND CRIED WELL BERTRAND HERE IS A REINFORCEMENT ALREADY ON
THE NIGHT OF THE 17TH TO THE 18TH OF JUNE HE RALLIED WELLINGTON
THAT
LITTLE ENGLISHMAN NEEDS A LESSON SAID NAPOLEON
THE RAIN REDOUBLED IN
VIOLENCE THE THUNDER ROLLED WHILE THE EMPEROR WAS SPEAKING
AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING HE LOST ONE ILLUSION
OFFICERS WHO HAD BEEN DESPATCHED TO RECONNOITRE ANNOUNCED TO HIM THAT
THE ENEMY WAS NOT MAKING ANY MOVEMENT
NOTHING WAS STIRRING NOT A
BIVOUAC FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED THE ENGLISH ARMY WAS ASLEEP
THE
SILENCE ON EARTH WAS PROFOUND THE ONLY NOISE WAS IN THE HEAVENS
AT FOUR O'CLOCK A PEASANT WAS BROUGHT IN TO HIM BY THE SCOUTS THIS
PEASANT HAD SERVED AS GUIDE TO A BRIGADE OF ENGLISH CAVALRY PROBABLY
VIVIAN'S BRIGADE WHICH WAS ON ITS WAY TO TAKE UP A POSITION IN THE
VILLAGE OF OHAIN AT THE EXTREME LEFT
AT FIVE O'CLOCK TWO BELGIAN
DESERTERS REPORTED TO HIM THAT THEY HAD JUST QUITTED THEIR REGIMENT
AND THAT THE ENGLISH ARMY WAS READY FOR BATTLE
SO MUCH THE BETTER
EXCLAIMED NAPOLEON
I PREFER TO OVERTHROW THEM RATHER THAN TO DRIVE
THEM BACK
IN THE MORNING HE DISMOUNTED IN THE MUD ON THE SLOPE WHICH FORMS AN
ANGLE WITH THE PLANCENOIT ROAD HAD A KITCHEN TABLE AND A PEASANT'S
CHAIR BROUGHT TO HIM FROM THE FARM OF ROSSOMME SEATED HIMSELF WITH A
TRUSS OF STRAW FOR A CARPET AND SPREAD OUT ON THE TABLE THE CHART
OF THE BATTLE FIELD SAYING TO SOULT AS HE DID SO A PRETTY
CHECKER BOARD
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE RAINS DURING THE NIGHT THE TRANSPORTS OF
PROVISIONS EMBEDDED IN THE SOFT ROADS HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ARRIVE BY
MORNING THE SOLDIERS HAD HAD NO SLEEP THEY WERE WET AND FASTING
THIS
DID NOT PREVENT NAPOLEON FROM EXCLAIMING CHEERFULLY TO NEY WE HAVE
NINETY CHANCES OUT OF A HUNDRED AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE EMPEROR'S
BREAKFAST WAS BROUGHT TO HIM
HE INVITED MANY GENERALS TO IT
DURING
BREAKFAST IT WAS SAID THAT WELLINGTON HAD BEEN TO A BALL TWO NIGHTS
BEFORE IN BRUSSELS AT THE DUCHESS OF RICHMOND'S AND SOULT A ROUGH
MAN OF WAR WITH A FACE OF AN ARCHBISHOP SAID THE BALL TAKES PLACE
TO DAY THE EMPEROR JESTED WITH NEY WHO SAID WELLINGTON WILL NOT BE
SO SIMPLE AS TO WAIT FOR YOUR MAJESTY THAT WAS HIS WAY HOWEVER
HE
WAS FOND OF JESTING SAYS FLEURY DE CHABOULON
A MERRY HUMOR WAS
AT THE FOUNDATION OF HIS CHARACTER SAYS GOURGAUD
HE ABOUNDED IN
PLEASANTRIES WHICH WERE MORE PECULIAR THAN WITTY SAYS BENJAMIN
CONSTANT
THESE GAYETIES OF A GIANT ARE WORTHY OF INSISTENCE
IT WAS
HE WHO CALLED HIS GRENADIERS HIS GRUMBLERS HE PINCHED THEIR EARS HE
PULLED THEIR MUSTACHES
THE EMPEROR DID NOTHING BUT PLAY PRANKS ON US
IS THE REMARK OF ONE OF THEM
DURING THE MYSTERIOUS TRIP FROM THE ISLAND
OF ELBA TO FRANCE ON THE 27TH OF FEBRUARY ON THE OPEN SEA THE FRENCH
BRIG OF WAR LE ZEPHYR HAVING ENCOUNTERED THE BRIG L'INCONSTANT ON
WHICH NAPOLEON WAS CONCEALED AND HAVING ASKED THE NEWS OF NAPOLEON
FROM L'INCONSTANT THE EMPEROR WHO STILL WORE IN HIS HAT THE WHITE AND
AMARANTHINE COCKADE SOWN WITH BEES WHICH HE HAD ADOPTED AT THE ISLE OF
ELBA LAUGHINGLY SEIZED THE SPEAKING TRUMPET AND ANSWERED FOR HIMSELF
THE EMPEROR IS WELL A MAN WHO LAUGHS LIKE THAT IS ON FAMILIAR TERMS
WITH EVENTS
NAPOLEON INDULGED IN MANY FITS OF THIS LAUGHTER DURING THE
BREAKFAST AT WATERLOO
AFTER BREAKFAST HE MEDITATED FOR A QUARTER OF AN
HOUR THEN TWO GENERALS SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE TRUSS OF STRAW PEN IN
HAND AND THEIR PAPER ON THEIR KNEES AND THE EMPEROR DICTATED TO THEM
THE ORDER OF BATTLE
AT NINE O'CLOCK AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE FRENCH ARMY RANGED IN ECHELONS
AND SET IN MOTION IN FIVE COLUMNS HAD DEPLOYED THE DIVISIONS IN TWO
LINES THE ARTILLERY BETWEEN THE BRIGADES THE MUSIC AT THEIR HEAD AS
THEY BEAT THE MARCH WITH ROLLS ON THE DRUMS AND THE BLASTS OF TRUMPETS
MIGHTY VAST JOYOUS A SEA OF CASQUES OF SABRES AND OF BAYONETS ON
THE HORIZON THE EMPEROR WAS TOUCHED AND TWICE EXCLAIMED MAGNIFICENT
MAGNIFICENT
BETWEEN NINE O'CLOCK AND HALF PAST TEN THE WHOLE ARMY INCREDIBLE AS IT
MAY APPEAR HAD TAKEN UP ITS POSITION AND RANGED ITSELF IN SIX LINES
FORMING TO REPEAT THE EMPEROR'S EXPRESSION THE FIGURE OF SIX V'S
A FEW MOMENTS AFTER THE FORMATION OF THE BATTLE ARRAY IN THE MIDST OF
THAT PROFOUND SILENCE LIKE THAT WHICH HERALDS THE BEGINNING OF A STORM
WHICH PRECEDES ENGAGEMENTS THE EMPEROR TAPPED HAXO ON THE SHOULDER AS
HE BEHELD THE THREE BATTERIES OF TWELVE POUNDERS DETACHED BY HIS ORDERS
FROM THE CORPS OF ERLON REILLE AND LOBAU AND DESTINED TO BEGIN THE
ACTION BY TAKING MONT SAINT JEAN WHICH WAS SITUATED AT THE INTERSECTION
OF THE NIVELLES AND THE GENAPPE ROADS AND SAID TO HIM THERE ARE FOUR
AND TWENTY HANDSOME MAIDS GENERAL
SURE OF THE ISSUE HE ENCOURAGED WITH A SMILE AS THEY PASSED BEFORE
HIM THE COMPANY OF SAPPERS OF THE FIRST CORPS WHICH HE HAD APPOINTED
TO BARRICADE MONT SAINT JEAN AS SOON AS THE VILLAGE SHOULD BE CARRIED
ALL THIS SERENITY HAD BEEN TRAVERSED BY BUT A SINGLE WORD OF HAUGHTY
PITY PERCEIVING ON HIS LEFT AT A SPOT WHERE THERE NOW STANDS A LARGE
TOMB THOSE ADMIRABLE SCOTCH GRAYS WITH THEIR SUPERB HORSES MASSING
THEMSELVES HE SAID IT IS A PITY
THEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE ADVANCED BEYOND ROSSOMME AND SELECTED FOR
HIS POST OF OBSERVATION A CONTRACTED ELEVATION OF TURF TO THE RIGHT OF
THE ROAD FROM GENAPPE TO BRUSSELS WHICH WAS HIS SECOND STATION DURING
THE BATTLE
THE THIRD STATION THE ONE ADOPTED AT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE
EVENING BETWEEN LA BELLE ALLIANCE AND LA HAIE SAINTE IS FORMIDABLE
IT IS A RATHER ELEVATED KNOLL WHICH STILL EXISTS AND BEHIND WHICH THE
GUARD WAS MASSED ON A SLOPE OF THE PLAIN
AROUND THIS KNOLL THE BALLS
REBOUNDED FROM THE PAVEMENTS OF THE ROAD UP TO NAPOLEON HIMSELF
AS AT
BRIENNE HE HAD OVER HIS HEAD THE SHRIEK OF THE BULLETS AND OF THE
HEAVY ARTILLERY
MOULDY CANNON BALLS OLD SWORD BLADES AND SHAPELESS
PROJECTILES EATEN UP WITH RUST WERE PICKED UP AT THE SPOT WHERE HIS
HORSE' FEET STOOD
SCABRA RUBIGINE
A FEW YEARS AGO A SHELL OF SIXTY
POUNDS STILL CHARGED AND WITH ITS FUSE BROKEN OFF LEVEL WITH THE BOMB
WAS UNEARTHED
IT WAS AT THIS LAST POST THAT THE EMPEROR SAID TO HIS
GUIDE LACOSTE A HOSTILE AND TERRIFIED PEASANT WHO WAS ATTACHED TO THE
SADDLE OF A HUSSAR AND WHO TURNED ROUND AT EVERY DISCHARGE OF CANISTER
AND TRIED TO HIDE BEHIND NAPOLEON FOOL IT IS SHAMEFUL YOU'LL GET
YOURSELF KILLED WITH A BALL IN THE BACK HE WHO WRITES THESE LINES HAS
HIMSELF FOUND IN THE FRIABLE SOIL OF THIS KNOLL ON TURNING OVER
THE SAND THE REMAINS OF THE NECK OF A BOMB DISINTEGRATED BY THE
OXIDIZATION OF SIX AND FORTY YEARS AND OLD FRAGMENTS OF IRON WHICH
PARTED LIKE ELDER TWIGS BETWEEN THE FINGERS
EVERY ONE IS AWARE THAT THE VARIOUSLY INCLINED UNDULATIONS OF THE
PLAINS WHERE THE ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN NAPOLEON AND WELLINGTON TOOK PLACE
ARE NO LONGER WHAT THEY WERE ON JUNE 18 1815
BY TAKING FROM THIS
MOURNFUL FIELD THE WHEREWITHAL TO MAKE A MONUMENT TO IT ITS REAL RELIEF
HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND HISTORY DISCONCERTED NO LONGER FINDS HER
BEARINGS THERE
IT HAS BEEN DISFIGURED FOR THE SAKE OF GLORIFYING
IT
WELLINGTON WHEN HE BEHELD WATERLOO ONCE MORE TWO YEARS LATER
EXCLAIMED THEY HAVE ALTERED MY FIELD OF BATTLE WHERE THE GREAT
PYRAMID OF EARTH SURMOUNTED BY THE LION RISES TO DAY THERE WAS A
HILLOCK WHICH DESCENDED IN AN EASY SLOPE TOWARDS THE NIVELLES ROAD BUT
WHICH WAS ALMOST AN ESCARPMENT ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY TO GENAPPE
THE ELEVATION OF THIS ESCARPMENT CAN STILL BE MEASURED BY THE HEIGHT OF
THE TWO KNOLLS OF THE TWO GREAT SEPULCHRES WHICH ENCLOSE THE ROAD FROM
GENAPPE TO BRUSSELS ONE THE ENGLISH TOMB IS ON THE LEFT THE OTHER
THE GERMAN TOMB IS ON THE RIGHT
THERE IS NO FRENCH TOMB
THE WHOLE
OF THAT PLAIN IS A SEPULCHRE FOR FRANCE
THANKS TO THE THOUSANDS UPON
THOUSANDS OF CARTLOADS OF EARTH EMPLOYED IN THE HILLOCK ONE HUNDRED AND
FIFTY FEET IN HEIGHT AND HALF A MILE IN CIRCUMFERENCE THE PLATEAU
OF MONT SAINT JEAN IS NOW ACCESSIBLE BY AN EASY SLOPE
ON THE DAY OF
BATTLE PARTICULARLY ON THE SIDE OF LA HAIE SAINTE IT WAS ABRUPT AND
DIFFICULT OF APPROACH
THE SLOPE THERE IS SO STEEP THAT THE ENGLISH
CANNON COULD NOT SEE THE FARM SITUATED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY
WHICH WAS THE CENTRE OF THE COMBAT
ON THE 18TH OF JUNE 1815 THE RAINS
HAD STILL FARTHER INCREASED THIS ACCLIVITY THE MUD COMPLICATED THE
PROBLEM OF THE ASCENT AND THE MEN NOT ONLY SLIPPED BACK BUT STUCK FAST
IN THE MIRE
ALONG THE CREST OF THE PLATEAU RAN A SORT OF TRENCH WHOSE
PRESENCE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE DISTANT OBSERVER TO DIVINE
WHAT WAS THIS TRENCH LET US EXPLAIN
BRAINE L'ALLEUD IS A BELGIAN
VILLAGE OHAIN IS ANOTHER
THESE VILLAGES BOTH OF THEM CONCEALED IN
CURVES OF THE LANDSCAPE ARE CONNECTED BY A ROAD ABOUT A LEAGUE AND A
HALF IN LENGTH WHICH TRAVERSES THE PLAIN ALONG ITS UNDULATING LEVEL
AND OFTEN ENTERS AND BURIES ITSELF IN THE HILLS LIKE A FURROW WHICH
MAKES A RAVINE OF THIS ROAD IN SOME PLACES
IN 1815 AS AT THE PRESENT
DAY THIS ROAD CUT THE CREST OF THE PLATEAU OF MONT SAINT JEAN BETWEEN
THE TWO HIGHWAYS FROM GENAPPE AND NIVELLES ONLY IT IS NOW ON A LEVEL
WITH THE PLAIN IT WAS THEN A HOLLOW WAY
ITS TWO SLOPES HAVE BEEN
APPROPRIATED FOR THE MONUMENTAL HILLOCK
THIS ROAD WAS AND STILL IS
A TRENCH THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PORTION OF ITS COURSE A HOLLOW TRENCH
SOMETIMES A DOZEN FEET IN DEPTH AND WHOSE BANKS BEING TOO STEEP
CRUMBLED AWAY HERE AND THERE PARTICULARLY IN WINTER UNDER DRIVING
RAINS
ACCIDENTS HAPPENED HERE
THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW AT THE
BRAINE L'ALLEUD ENTRANCE THAT A PASSER BY WAS CRUSHED BY A CART AS IS
PROVED BY A STONE CROSS WHICH STANDS NEAR THE CEMETERY AND WHICH GIVES
THE NAME OF THE DEAD MONSIEUR BERNARD DEBRYE MERCHANT OF BRUSSELS
AND THE DATE OF THE ACCIDENT FEBRUARY 1637 8 IT WAS SO DEEP ON
THE TABLE LAND OF MONT SAINT JEAN THAT A PEASANT MATHIEU NICAISE
WAS CRUSHED THERE IN 1783 BY A SLIDE FROM THE SLOPE AS IS STATED ON
ANOTHER STONE CROSS THE TOP OF WHICH HAS DISAPPEARED IN THE PROCESS OF
CLEARING THE GROUND BUT WHOSE OVERTURNED PEDESTAL IS STILL VISIBLE ON
THE GRASSY SLOPE TO THE LEFT OF THE HIGHWAY BETWEEN LA HAIE SAINTE AND
THE FARM OF MONT SAINT JEAN
ON THE DAY OF BATTLE THIS HOLLOW ROAD WHOSE EXISTENCE WAS IN NO WAY
INDICATED BORDERING THE CREST OF MONT SAINT JEAN A TRENCH AT THE
SUMMIT OF THE ESCARPMENT A RUT CONCEALED IN THE SOIL WAS INVISIBLE
THAT IS TO SAY TERRIBLE
CHAPTER VIII THE EMPEROR PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE
SO ON THE MORNING OF WATERLOO NAPOLEON WAS CONTENT
HE WAS RIGHT THE PLAN OF BATTLE CONCEIVED BY HIM WAS AS WE HAVE SEEN
REALLY ADMIRABLE
THE BATTLE ONCE BEGUN ITS VERY VARIOUS CHANGES THE RESISTANCE OF
HOUGOMONT THE TENACITY OF LA HAIE SAINTE THE KILLING OF BAUDUIN THE
DISABLING OF FOY THE UNEXPECTED WALL AGAINST WHICH SOYE'S BRIGADE WAS
SHATTERED GUILLEMINOT'S FATAL HEEDLESSNESS WHEN HE HAD NEITHER PETARD
NOR POWDER SACKS THE MIRING OF THE BATTERIES THE FIFTEEN UNESCORTED
PIECES OVERWHELMED IN A HOLLOW WAY BY UXBRIDGE THE SMALL EFFECT OF THE
BOMBS FALLING IN THE ENGLISH LINES AND THERE EMBEDDING THEMSELVES IN
THE RAIN SOAKED SOIL AND ONLY SUCCEEDING IN PRODUCING VOLCANOES OF MUD
SO THAT THE CANISTER WAS TURNED INTO A SPLASH THE USELESSNESS OF PIRE'S
DEMONSTRATION ON BRAINE L'ALLEUD ALL THAT CAVALRY FIFTEEN SQUADRONS
ALMOST EXTERMINATED THE RIGHT WING OF THE ENGLISH BADLY ALARMED THE
LEFT WING BADLY CUT INTO NEY'S STRANGE MISTAKE IN MASSING INSTEAD OF
ECHELONNING THE FOUR DIVISIONS OF THE FIRST CORPS MEN DELIVERED OVER TO
GRAPE SHOT ARRANGED IN RANKS TWENTY SEVEN DEEP AND WITH A FRONTAGE
OF TWO HUNDRED THE FRIGHTFUL HOLES MADE IN THESE MASSES BY THE
CANNON BALLS ATTACKING COLUMNS DISORGANIZED THE SIDE BATTERY SUDDENLY
UNMASKED ON THEIR FLANK BOURGEOIS DONZELOT AND DURUTTE COMPROMISED
QUIOT REPULSED LIEUTENANT VIEUX THAT HERCULES GRADUATED AT THE
POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL WOUNDED AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE WAS BEATING IN WITH AN
AXE THE DOOR OF LA HAIE SAINTE UNDER THE DOWNRIGHT FIRE OF THE ENGLISH
BARRICADE WHICH BARRED THE ANGLE OF THE ROAD FROM GENAPPE TO BRUSSELS
MARCOGNET'S DIVISION CAUGHT BETWEEN THE INFANTRY AND THE CAVALRY SHOT
DOWN AT THE VERY MUZZLE OF THE GUNS AMID THE GRAIN BY BEST AND PACK PUT
TO THE SWORD BY PONSONBY HIS BATTERY OF SEVEN PIECES SPIKED THE PRINCE
OF SAXE WEIMAR HOLDING AND GUARDING IN SPITE OF THE COMTE D'ERLON BOTH
FRISCHEMONT AND SMOHAIN THE FLAG OF THE 105TH TAKEN THE FLAG OF THE
45TH CAPTURED THAT BLACK PRUSSIAN HUSSAR STOPPED BY RUNNERS OF THE
FLYING COLUMN OF THREE HUNDRED LIGHT CAVALRY ON THE SCOUT BETWEEN WAVRE
AND PLANCENOIT THE ALARMING THINGS THAT HAD BEEN SAID BY PRISONERS
GROUCHY'S DELAY FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN KILLED IN THE ORCHARD OF HOUGOMONT
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MEN OVERTHROWN IN A STILL SHORTER
TIME ABOUT LA HAIE SAINTE ALL THESE STORMY INCIDENTS PASSING LIKE THE
CLOUDS OF BATTLE BEFORE NAPOLEON HAD HARDLY TROUBLED HIS GAZE AND
HAD NOT OVERSHADOWED THAT FACE OF IMPERIAL CERTAINTY
NAPOLEON WAS
ACCUSTOMED TO GAZE STEADILY AT WAR HE NEVER ADDED UP THE HEART RENDING
DETAILS CIPHER BY CIPHER CIPHERS MATTERED LITTLE TO HIM PROVIDED THAT
THEY FURNISHED THE TOTAL VICTORY HE WAS NOT ALARMED IF THE BEGINNINGS
DID GO ASTRAY SINCE HE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE MASTER AND THE POSSESSOR
AT THE END HE KNEW HOW TO WAIT SUPPOSING HIMSELF TO BE OUT OF THE
QUESTION AND HE TREATED DESTINY AS HIS EQUAL HE SEEMED TO SAY TO FATE
THOU WILT NOT DARE
COMPOSED HALF OF LIGHT AND HALF OF SHADOW NAPOLEON THOUGHT HIMSELF
PROTECTED IN GOOD AND TOLERATED IN EVIL
HE HAD OR THOUGHT THAT HE HAD
A CONNIVANCE ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY A COMPLICITY OF EVENTS IN HIS FAVOR
WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO THE INVULNERABILITY OF ANTIQUITY
NEVERTHELESS WHEN ONE HAS BERESINA LEIPZIG AND FONTAINEBLEAU BEHIND
ONE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ONE MIGHT DISTRUST WATERLOO
A MYSTERIOUS FROWN
BECOMES PERCEPTIBLE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE HEAVENS
AT THE MOMENT WHEN WELLINGTON RETREATED NAPOLEON SHUDDERED
HE SUDDENLY
BEHELD THE TABLE LAND OF MONT SAINT JEAN CLEARED AND THE VAN OF THE
ENGLISH ARMY DISAPPEAR
IT WAS RALLYING BUT HIDING ITSELF
THE EMPEROR
HALF ROSE IN HIS STIRRUPS
THE LIGHTNING OF VICTORY FLASHED FROM HIS
EYES
WELLINGTON DRIVEN INTO A CORNER AT THE FOREST OF SOIGNES AND
DESTROYED THAT WAS THE DEFINITIVE CONQUEST OF ENGLAND BY FRANCE IT WAS
CRECY POITIERS MALPLAQUET AND RAMILLIES AVENGED
THE MAN OF MARENGO
WAS WIPING OUT AGINCOURT
SO THE EMPEROR MEDITATING ON THIS TERRIBLE TURN OF FORTUNE SWEPT HIS
GLASS FOR THE LAST TIME OVER ALL THE POINTS OF THE FIELD OF BATTLE
HIS
GUARD STANDING BEHIND HIM WITH GROUNDED ARMS WATCHED HIM FROM BELOW
WITH A SORT OF RELIGION
HE PONDERED HE EXAMINED THE SLOPES NOTED THE
DECLIVITIES SCRUTINIZED THE CLUMPS OF TREES THE SQUARE OF RYE THE
PATH HE SEEMED TO BE COUNTING EACH BUSH
HE GAZED WITH SOME INTENTNESS
AT THE ENGLISH BARRICADES OF THE TWO HIGHWAYS TWO LARGE ABATIS OF
TREES THAT ON THE ROAD TO GENAPPE ABOVE LA HAIE SAINTE ARMED WITH TWO
CANNON THE ONLY ONES OUT OF ALL THE ENGLISH ARTILLERY WHICH COMMANDED
THE EXTREMITY OF THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND THAT ON THE ROAD TO NIVELLES
WHERE GLEAMED THE DUTCH BAYONETS OF CHASSE'S BRIGADE
NEAR THIS
BARRICADE HE OBSERVED THE OLD CHAPEL OF SAINT NICHOLAS PAINTED WHITE
WHICH STANDS AT THE ANGLE OF THE CROSS ROAD NEAR BRAINE L'ALLEUD HE
BENT DOWN AND SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE
THE GUIDE MADE
A NEGATIVE SIGN WITH HIS HEAD WHICH WAS PROBABLY PERFIDIOUS
THE EMPEROR STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AND FELL TO THINKING
WELLINGTON HAD DRAWN BACK
ALL THAT REMAINED TO DO WAS TO COMPLETE THIS RETREAT BY CRUSHING HIM
NAPOLEON TURNING ROUND ABRUPTLY DESPATCHED AN EXPRESS AT FULL SPEED TO
PARIS TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE BATTLE WAS WON
NAPOLEON WAS ONE OF THOSE GENIUSES FROM WHOM THUNDER DARTS
HE HAD JUST FOUND HIS CLAP OF THUNDER
HE GAVE ORDERS TO MILHAUD'S CUIRASSIERS TO CARRY THE TABLE LAND OF
MONT SAINT JEAN
CHAPTER IX THE UNEXPECTED
THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM
THEY FORMED A FRONT A
QUARTER OF A LEAGUE IN EXTENT
THEY WERE GIANT MEN ON COLOSSAL HORSES
THERE WERE SIX AND TWENTY SQUADRONS OF THEM AND THEY HAD BEHIND THEM TO
SUPPORT THEM LEFEBVRE DESNOUETTES'S DIVISION THE ONE HUNDRED AND SIX
PICKED GENDARMES THE LIGHT CAVALRY OF THE GUARD ELEVEN HUNDRED AND
NINETY SEVEN MEN AND THE LANCERS OF THE GUARD OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND
EIGHTY LANCES
THEY WORE CASQUES WITHOUT HORSE TAILS AND CUIRASSES
OF BEATEN IRON WITH HORSE PISTOLS IN THEIR HOLSTERS AND LONG
SABRE SWORDS
THAT MORNING THE WHOLE ARMY HAD ADMIRED THEM WHEN AT
NINE O'CLOCK WITH BRAYING OF TRUMPETS AND ALL THE MUSIC PLAYING LET US
WATCH O'ER THE SAFETY OF THE EMPIRE THEY HAD COME IN A SOLID COLUMN
WITH ONE OF THEIR BATTERIES ON THEIR FLANK ANOTHER IN THEIR CENTRE AND
DEPLOYED IN TWO RANKS BETWEEN THE ROADS TO GENAPPE AND FRISCHEMONT
AND TAKEN UP THEIR POSITION FOR BATTLE IN THAT POWERFUL SECOND LINE
SO CLEVERLY ARRANGED BY NAPOLEON WHICH HAVING ON ITS EXTREME LEFT
KELLERMANN'S CUIRASSIERS AND ON ITS EXTREME RIGHT MILHAUD'S CUIRASSIERS
HAD SO TO SPEAK TWO WINGS OF IRON
AIDE DE CAMP BERNARD CARRIED THEM THE EMPEROR'S ORDERS
NEY DREW HIS
SWORD AND PLACED HIMSELF AT THEIR HEAD
THE ENORMOUS SQUADRONS WERE SET
IN MOTION
THEN A FORMIDABLE SPECTACLE WAS SEEN
ALL THEIR CAVALRY WITH UPRAISED SWORDS STANDARDS AND TRUMPETS FLUNG TO
THE BREEZE FORMED IN COLUMNS BY DIVISIONS DESCENDED BY A SIMULTANEOUS
MOVEMENT AND LIKE ONE MAN WITH THE PRECISION OF A BRAZEN BATTERING RAM
WHICH IS EFFECTING A BREACH THE HILL OF LA BELLE ALLIANCE PLUNGED INTO
THE TERRIBLE DEPTHS IN WHICH SO MANY MEN HAD ALREADY FALLEN DISAPPEARED
THERE IN THE SMOKE THEN EMERGING FROM THAT SHADOW REAPPEARED ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY STILL COMPACT AND IN CLOSE RANKS MOUNTING AT
A FULL TROT THROUGH A STORM OF GRAPE SHOT WHICH BURST UPON THEM
THE TERRIBLE MUDDY SLOPE OF THE TABLE LAND OF MONT SAINT JEAN
THEY
ASCENDED GRAVE THREATENING IMPERTURBABLE IN THE INTERVALS BETWEEN
THE MUSKETRY AND THE ARTILLERY THEIR COLOSSAL TRAMPLING WAS AUDIBLE
BEING TWO DIVISIONS THERE WERE TWO COLUMNS OF THEM WATHIER'S DIVISION
HELD THE RIGHT DELORT'S DIVISION WAS ON THE LEFT
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH
TWO IMMENSE ADDERS OF STEEL WERE TO BE SEEN CRAWLING TOWARDS THE CREST
OF THE TABLE LAND
IT TRAVERSED THE BATTLE LIKE A PRODIGY
NOTHING LIKE IT HAD BEEN SEEN SINCE THE TAKING OF THE GREAT REDOUBT OF
THE MUSKOWA BY THE HEAVY CAVALRY MURAT WAS LACKING HERE BUT NEY WAS
AGAIN PRESENT
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THAT MASS HAD BECOME A MONSTER AND
HAD BUT ONE SOUL
EACH COLUMN UNDULATED AND SWELLED LIKE THE RING OF A
POLYP
THEY COULD BE SEEN THROUGH A VAST CLOUD OF SMOKE WHICH WAS RENT
HERE AND THERE
A CONFUSION OF HELMETS OF CRIES OF SABRES A STORMY
HEAVING OF THE CRUPPERS OF HORSES AMID THE CANNONS AND THE FLOURISH OF
TRUMPETS A TERRIBLE AND DISCIPLINED TUMULT OVER ALL THE CUIRASSES
LIKE THE SCALES ON THE HYDRA
THESE NARRATIONS SEEMED TO BELONG TO ANOTHER AGE
SOMETHING PARALLEL TO
THIS VISION APPEARED NO DOUBT IN THE ANCIENT ORPHIC EPICS WHICH TOLD
OF THE CENTAURS THE OLD HIPPANTHROPES THOSE TITANS WITH HUMAN
HEADS AND EQUESTRIAN CHESTS WHO SCALED OLYMPUS AT A GALLOP HORRIBLE
INVULNERABLE SUBLIME GODS AND BEASTS
ODD NUMERICAL COINCIDENCE TWENTY SIX BATTALIONS RODE TO MEET
TWENTY SIX BATTALIONS
BEHIND THE CREST OF THE PLATEAU IN THE SHADOW OF
THE MASKED BATTERY THE ENGLISH INFANTRY FORMED INTO THIRTEEN SQUARES
TWO BATTALIONS TO THE SQUARE IN TWO LINES WITH SEVEN IN THE FIRST
LINE SIX IN THE SECOND THE STOCKS OF THEIR GUNS TO THEIR SHOULDERS
TAKING AIM AT THAT WHICH WAS ON THE POINT OF APPEARING WAITED CALM
MUTE MOTIONLESS
THEY DID NOT SEE THE CUIRASSIERS AND THE CUIRASSIERS
DID NOT SEE THEM
THEY LISTENED TO THE RISE OF THIS FLOOD OF MEN
THEY
HEARD THE SWELLING NOISE OF THREE THOUSAND HORSE THE ALTERNATE AND
SYMMETRICAL TRAMP OF THEIR HOOFS AT FULL TROT THE JINGLING OF THE
CUIRASSES THE CLANG OF THE SABRES AND A SORT OF GRAND AND SAVAGE
BREATHING
THERE ENSUED A MOST TERRIBLE SILENCE THEN ALL AT ONCE
A LONG FILE OF UPLIFTED ARMS BRANDISHING SABRES APPEARED ABOVE THE
CREST AND CASQUES TRUMPETS AND STANDARDS AND THREE THOUSAND HEADS
WITH GRAY MUSTACHES SHOUTING VIVE L'EMPEREUR ALL THIS CAVALRY
DEBOUCHED ON THE PLATEAU AND IT WAS LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF AN
EARTHQUAKE
ALL AT ONCE A TRAGIC INCIDENT ON THE ENGLISH LEFT ON OUR RIGHT THE
HEAD OF THE COLUMN OF CUIRASSIERS REARED UP WITH A FRIGHTFUL CLAMOR
ON
ARRIVING AT THE CULMINATING POINT OF THE CREST UNGOVERNABLE UTTERLY
GIVEN OVER TO FURY AND THEIR COURSE OF EXTERMINATION OF THE SQUARES AND
CANNON THE CUIRASSIERS HAD JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF A TRENCH A TRENCH
BETWEEN THEM AND THE ENGLISH
IT WAS THE HOLLOW ROAD OF OHAIN
IT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT
THE RAVINE WAS THERE UNEXPECTED YAWNING
DIRECTLY UNDER THE HORSES' FEET TWO FATHOMS DEEP BETWEEN ITS DOUBLE
SLOPES THE SECOND FILE PUSHED THE FIRST INTO IT AND THE THIRD PUSHED
ON THE SECOND THE HORSES REARED AND FELL BACKWARD LANDED ON THEIR
HAUNCHES SLID DOWN ALL FOUR FEET IN THE AIR CRUSHING AND OVERWHELMING
THE RIDERS AND THERE BEING NO MEANS OF RETREAT THE WHOLE COLUMN BEING
NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE THAN A PROJECTILE THE FORCE WHICH HAD BEEN
ACQUIRED TO CRUSH THE ENGLISH CRUSHED THE FRENCH THE INEXORABLE RAVINE
COULD ONLY YIELD WHEN FILLED HORSES AND RIDERS ROLLED THERE PELL MELL
GRINDING EACH OTHER FORMING BUT ONE MASS OF FLESH IN THIS GULF WHEN
THIS TRENCH WAS FULL OF LIVING MEN THE REST MARCHED OVER THEM AND
PASSED ON
ALMOST A THIRD OF DUBOIS'S BRIGADE FELL INTO THAT ABYSS
THIS BEGAN THE LOSS OF THE BATTLE
A LOCAL TRADITION WHICH EVIDENTLY EXAGGERATES MATTERS SAYS THAT TWO
THOUSAND HORSES AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN WERE BURIED IN THE HOLLOW ROAD
OF OHAIN
THIS FIGURE PROBABLY COMPRISES ALL THE OTHER CORPSES WHICH
WERE FLUNG INTO THIS RAVINE THE DAY AFTER THE COMBAT
LET US NOTE IN PASSING THAT IT WAS DUBOIS'S SORELY TRIED BRIGADE WHICH
AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY MAKING A CHARGE TO ONE SIDE HAD CAPTURED THE FLAG
OF THE LUNENBURG BATTALION
NAPOLEON BEFORE GIVING THE ORDER FOR THIS CHARGE OF MILHAUD'S
CUIRASSIERS HAD SCRUTINIZED THE GROUND BUT HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE
THAT HOLLOW ROAD WHICH DID NOT EVEN FORM A WRINKLE ON THE SURFACE OF
THE PLATEAU
WARNED NEVERTHELESS AND PUT ON THE ALERT BY THE LITTLE
WHITE CHAPEL WHICH MARKS ITS ANGLE OF JUNCTION WITH THE NIVELLES
HIGHWAY HE HAD PROBABLY PUT A QUESTION AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF AN
OBSTACLE TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE
THE GUIDE HAD ANSWERED NO
WE MIGHT
ALMOST AFFIRM THAT NAPOLEON'S CATASTROPHE ORIGINATED IN THAT SIGN OF A
PEASANT'S HEAD
OTHER FATALITIES WERE DESTINED TO ARISE
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT NAPOLEON SHOULD HAVE WON THAT BATTLE WE ANSWER NO
WHY BECAUSE OF WELLINGTON BECAUSE OF BLUCHER NO
BECAUSE OF GOD
BONAPARTE VICTOR AT WATERLOO THAT DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE LAW OF THE
NINETEENTH CENTURY
ANOTHER SERIES OF FACTS WAS IN PREPARATION IN WHICH
THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR NAPOLEON
THE ILL WILL OF EVENTS HAD
DECLARED ITSELF LONG BEFORE
IT WAS TIME THAT THIS VAST MAN SHOULD FALL
THE EXCESSIVE WEIGHT OF THIS MAN IN HUMAN DESTINY DISTURBED THE BALANCE
THIS INDIVIDUAL ALONE COUNTED FOR MORE THAN A UNIVERSAL GROUP
THESE
PLETHORAS OF ALL HUMAN VITALITY CONCENTRATED IN A SINGLE HEAD THE WORLD
MOUNTING TO THE BRAIN OF ONE MAN THIS WOULD BE MORTAL TO CIVILIZATION
WERE IT TO LAST
THE MOMENT HAD ARRIVED FOR THE INCORRUPTIBLE AND
SUPREME EQUITY TO ALTER ITS PLAN
PROBABLY THE PRINCIPLES AND THE
ELEMENTS ON WHICH THE REGULAR GRAVITATIONS OF THE MORAL AS OF THE
MATERIAL WORLD DEPEND HAD COMPLAINED
SMOKING BLOOD OVER FILLED
CEMETERIES MOTHERS IN TEARS THESE ARE FORMIDABLE PLEADERS
WHEN
THE EARTH IS SUFFERING FROM TOO HEAVY A BURDEN THERE ARE MYSTERIOUS
GROANINGS OF THE SHADES TO WHICH THE ABYSS LENDS AN EAR
NAPOLEON HAD BEEN DENOUNCED IN THE INFINITE AND HIS FALL HAD BEEN
DECIDED ON
HE EMBARRASSED GOD
WATERLOO IS NOT A BATTLE IT IS A CHANGE OF FRONT ON THE PART OF THE
UNIVERSE
CHAPTER X THE PLATEAU OF MONT SAINT JEAN
THE BATTERY WAS UNMASKED AT THE SAME MOMENT WITH THE RAVINE
SIXTY CANNONS AND THE THIRTEEN SQUARES DARTED LIGHTNING POINT BLANK ON
THE CUIRASSIERS
THE INTREPID GENERAL DELORT MADE THE MILITARY SALUTE TO
THE ENGLISH BATTERY
THE WHOLE OF THE FLYING ARTILLERY OF THE ENGLISH HAD RE ENTERED THE
SQUARES AT A GALLOP
THE CUIRASSIERS HAD NOT HAD EVEN THE TIME FOR A
HALT
THE DISASTER OF THE HOLLOW ROAD HAD DECIMATED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED
THEM
THEY BELONGED TO THAT CLASS OF MEN WHO WHEN DIMINISHED IN NUMBER
INCREASE IN COURAGE
WATHIER'S COLUMN ALONE HAD SUFFERED IN THE DISASTER DELORT'S COLUMN
WHICH NEY HAD DEFLECTED TO THE LEFT AS THOUGH HE HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF
AN AMBUSH HAD ARRIVED WHOLE
THE CUIRASSIERS HURLED THEMSELVES ON THE ENGLISH SQUARES
AT FULL SPEED WITH BRIDLES LOOSE SWORDS IN THEIR TEETH PISTOLS IN
FIST SUCH WAS THE ATTACK
THERE ARE MOMENTS IN BATTLES IN WHICH THE SOUL HARDENS THE MAN UNTIL
THE SOLDIER IS CHANGED INTO A STATUE AND WHEN ALL THIS FLESH TURNS INTO
GRANITE
THE ENGLISH BATTALIONS DESPERATELY ASSAULTED DID NOT STIR
THEN IT WAS TERRIBLE
ALL THE FACES OF THE ENGLISH SQUARES WERE ATTACKED AT ONCE
A FRENZIED
WHIRL ENVELOPED THEM
THAT COLD INFANTRY REMAINED IMPASSIVE
THE FIRST
RANK KNELT AND RECEIVED THE CUIRASSIERS ON THEIR BAYONETS THE SECOND
RANKS SHOT THEM DOWN BEHIND THE SECOND RANK THE CANNONEERS CHARGED
THEIR GUNS THE FRONT OF THE SQUARE PARTED PERMITTED THE PASSAGE OF
AN ERUPTION OF GRAPE SHOT AND CLOSED AGAIN
THE CUIRASSIERS REPLIED
BY CRUSHING THEM
THEIR GREAT HORSES REARED STRODE ACROSS THE RANKS
LEAPED OVER THE BAYONETS AND FELL GIGANTIC IN THE MIDST OF THESE FOUR
LIVING WELLS
THE CANNON BALLS PLOUGHED FURROWS IN THESE CUIRASSIERS
THE CUIRASSIERS MADE BREACHES IN THE SQUARES
FILES OF MEN DISAPPEARED
GROUND TO DUST UNDER THE HORSES
THE BAYONETS PLUNGED INTO THE BELLIES
OF THESE CENTAURS HENCE A HIDEOUSNESS OF WOUNDS WHICH HAS PROBABLY
NEVER BEEN SEEN ANYWHERE ELSE
THE SQUARES WASTED BY THIS MAD CAVALRY
CLOSED UP THEIR RANKS WITHOUT FLINCHING
INEXHAUSTIBLE IN THE MATTER OF
GRAPE SHOT THEY CREATED EXPLOSIONS IN THEIR ASSAILANTS' MIDST
THE FORM
OF THIS COMBAT WAS MONSTROUS
THESE SQUARES WERE NO LONGER BATTALIONS
THEY WERE CRATERS THOSE CUIRASSIERS WERE NO LONGER CAVALRY THEY WERE
A TEMPEST
EACH SQUARE WAS A VOLCANO ATTACKED BY A CLOUD LAVA CONTENDED
WITH LIGHTNING
THE SQUARE ON THE EXTREME RIGHT THE MOST EXPOSED OF ALL BEING IN THE
AIR WAS ALMOST ANNIHILATED AT THE VERY FIRST SHOCK
LT WAS FORMED
OF THE 75TH REGIMENT OF HIGHLANDERS
THE BAGPIPE PLAYER IN THE CENTRE
DROPPED HIS MELANCHOLY EYES FILLED WITH THE REFLECTIONS OF THE
FORESTS AND THE LAKES IN PROFOUND INATTENTION WHILE MEN WERE BEING
EXTERMINATED AROUND HIM AND SEATED ON A DRUM WITH HIS PIBROCH UNDER
HIS ARM PLAYED THE HIGHLAND AIRS
THESE SCOTCHMEN DIED THINKING OF BEN
LOTHIAN AS DID THE GREEKS RECALLING ARGOS
THE SWORD OF A CUIRASSIER
WHICH HEWED DOWN THE BAGPIPES AND THE ARM WHICH BORE IT PUT AN END TO
THE SONG BY KILLING THE SINGER
THE CUIRASSIERS RELATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER AND STILL FURTHER DIMINISHED
BY THE CATASTROPHE OF THE RAVINE HAD ALMOST THE WHOLE ENGLISH ARMY
AGAINST THEM BUT THEY MULTIPLIED THEMSELVES SO THAT EACH MAN OF THEM
WAS EQUAL TO TEN
NEVERTHELESS SOME HANOVERIAN BATTALIONS YIELDED
WELLINGTON PERCEIVED IT AND THOUGHT OF HIS CAVALRY
HAD NAPOLEON AT
THAT SAME MOMENT THOUGHT OF HIS INFANTRY HE WOULD HAVE WON THE BATTLE
THIS FORGETFULNESS WAS HIS GREAT AND FATAL MISTAKE
ALL AT ONCE THE CUIRASSIERS WHO HAD BEEN THE ASSAILANTS FOUND
THEMSELVES ASSAILED
THE ENGLISH CAVALRY WAS AT THEIR BACK
BEFORE
THEM TWO SQUARES BEHIND THEM SOMERSET SOMERSET MEANT FOURTEEN HUNDRED
DRAGOONS OF THE GUARD
ON THE RIGHT SOMERSET HAD DORNBERG WITH THE
GERMAN LIGHT HORSE AND ON HIS LEFT TRIP WITH THE BELGIAN CARABINEERS
THE CUIRASSIERS ATTACKED ON THE FLANK AND IN FRONT BEFORE AND IN THE
REAR BY INFANTRY AND CAVALRY HAD TO FACE ALL SIDES
WHAT MATTERED IT
TO THEM THEY WERE A WHIRLWIND
THEIR VALOR WAS SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLE
IN ADDITION TO THIS THEY HAD BEHIND THEM THE BATTERY WHICH WAS STILL
THUNDERING
IT WAS NECESSARY THAT IT SHOULD BE SO OR THEY COULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN THE BACK
ONE OF THEIR CUIRASSES PIERCED ON THE
SHOULDER BY A BALL FROM A BISCAYAN 9 IS IN THE COLLECTION OF THE
WATERLOO MUSEUM
FOR SUCH FRENCHMEN NOTHING LESS THAN SUCH ENGLISHMEN WAS NEEDED
IT
WAS NO LONGER A HAND TO HAND CONFLICT IT WAS A SHADOW A FURY A DIZZY
TRANSPORT OF SOULS AND COURAGE A HURRICANE OF LIGHTNING SWORDS
IN AN
INSTANT THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED DRAGOON GUARDS NUMBERED ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED
FULLER THEIR LIEUTENANT COLONEL FELL DEAD
NEY RUSHED UP WITH
THE LANCERS AND LEFEBVRE DESNOUETTES'S LIGHT HORSE
THE PLATEAU
OF MONT SAINT JEAN WAS CAPTURED RECAPTURED CAPTURED AGAIN
THE
CUIRASSIERS QUITTED THE CAVALRY TO RETURN TO THE INFANTRY OR TO PUT
IT MORE EXACTLY THE WHOLE OF THAT FORMIDABLE ROUT COLLARED EACH OTHER
WITHOUT RELEASING THE OTHER
THE SQUARES STILL HELD FIRM
THERE WERE A DOZEN ASSAULTS
NEY HAD FOUR HORSES KILLED UNDER HIM
HALF
THE CUIRASSIERS REMAINED ON THE PLATEAU
THIS CONFLICT LASTED TWO HOURS
THE ENGLISH ARMY WAS PROFOUNDLY SHAKEN
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HAD THEY
NOT BEEN ENFEEBLED IN THEIR FIRST SHOCK BY THE DISASTER OF THE HOLLOW
ROAD THE CUIRASSIERS WOULD HAVE OVERWHELMED THE CENTRE AND DECIDED THE
VICTORY
THIS EXTRAORDINARY CAVALRY PETRIFIED CLINTON WHO HAD SEEN
TALAVERA AND BADAJOZ
WELLINGTON THREE QUARTERS VANQUISHED ADMIRED
HEROICALLY
HE SAID IN AN UNDERTONE SUBLIME
THE CUIRASSIERS ANNIHILATED SEVEN SQUARES OUT OF THIRTEEN TOOK OR
SPIKED SIXTY PIECES OF ORDNANCE AND CAPTURED FROM THE ENGLISH REGIMENTS
SIX FLAGS WHICH THREE CUIRASSIERS AND THREE CHASSEURS OF THE GUARD BORE
TO THE EMPEROR IN FRONT OF THE FARM OF LA BELLE ALLIANCE
WELLINGTON'S SITUATION HAD GROWN WORSE
THIS STRANGE BATTLE WAS LIKE A
DUEL BETWEEN TWO RAGING WOUNDED MEN EACH OF WHOM STILL FIGHTING AND
STILL RESISTING IS EXPENDING ALL HIS BLOOD
WHICH OF THE TWO WILL BE THE FIRST TO FALL
THE CONFLICT ON THE PLATEAU CONTINUED
WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE CUIRASSIERS NO ONE COULD HAVE TOLD
ONE THING
IS CERTAIN THAT ON THE DAY AFTER THE BATTLE A CUIRASSIER AND HIS
HORSE WERE FOUND DEAD AMONG THE WOODWORK OF THE SCALES FOR VEHICLES AT
MONT SAINT JEAN AT THE VERY POINT WHERE THE FOUR ROADS FROM NIVELLES
GENAPPE LA HULPE AND BRUSSELS MEET AND INTERSECT EACH OTHER
THIS
HORSEMAN HAD PIERCED THE ENGLISH LINES
ONE OF THE MEN WHO PICKED UP THE
BODY STILL LIVES AT MONT SAINT JEAN
HIS NAME IS DEHAZE
HE WAS EIGHTEEN
YEARS OLD AT THAT TIME
WELLINGTON FELT THAT HE WAS YIELDING
THE CRISIS WAS AT HAND
THE CUIRASSIERS HAD NOT SUCCEEDED SINCE THE CENTRE WAS NOT BROKEN
THROUGH
AS EVERY ONE WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE PLATEAU NO ONE HELD IT
AND IN FACT IT REMAINED TO A GREAT EXTENT WITH THE ENGLISH
WELLINGTON
HELD THE VILLAGE AND THE CULMINATING PLAIN NEY HAD ONLY THE CREST AND
THE SLOPE
THEY SEEMED ROOTED IN THAT FATAL SOIL ON BOTH SIDES
BUT THE WEAKENING OF THE ENGLISH SEEMED IRREMEDIABLE
THE BLEEDING
OF THAT ARMY WAS HORRIBLE
KEMPT ON THE LEFT WING DEMANDED
REINFORCEMENTS
THERE ARE NONE REPLIED WELLINGTON HE MUST LET
HIMSELF BE KILLED ALMOST AT THAT SAME MOMENT A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE
WHICH PAINTS THE EXHAUSTION OF THE TWO ARMIES NEY DEMANDED INFANTRY
FROM NAPOLEON AND NAPOLEON EXCLAIMED INFANTRY WHERE DOES HE EXPECT
ME TO GET IT DOES HE THINK I CAN MAKE IT
NEVERTHELESS THE ENGLISH ARMY WAS IN THE WORSE CASE OF THE TWO
THE
FURIOUS ONSETS OF THOSE GREAT SQUADRONS WITH CUIRASSES OF IRON AND
BREASTS OF STEEL HAD GROUND THE INFANTRY TO NOTHING
A FEW MEN CLUSTERED
ROUND A FLAG MARKED THE POST OF A REGIMENT SUCH AND SUCH A BATTALION
WAS COMMANDED ONLY BY A CAPTAIN OR A LIEUTENANT ALTEN'S DIVISION
ALREADY SO ROUGHLY HANDLED AT LA HAIE SAINTE WAS ALMOST DESTROYED
THE INTREPID BELGIANS OF VAN KLUZE'S BRIGADE STREWED THE RYE FIELDS
ALL ALONG THE NIVELLES ROAD HARDLY ANYTHING WAS LEFT OF THOSE DUTCH
GRENADIERS WHO INTERMINGLED WITH SPANIARDS IN OUR RANKS IN 1811
FOUGHT AGAINST WELLINGTON AND WHO IN 1815 RALLIED TO THE
ENGLISH STANDARD FOUGHT AGAINST NAPOLEON
THE LOSS IN OFFICERS WAS
CONSIDERABLE
LORD UXBRIDGE WHO HAD HIS LEG BURIED ON THE FOLLOWING
DAY HAD HIS KNEE SHATTERED
IF ON THE FRENCH SIDE IN THAT TUSSLE
OF THE CUIRASSIERS DELORT L'HERITIER COLBERT DNOP TRAVERS AND
BLANCARD WERE DISABLED ON THE SIDE OF THE ENGLISH THERE WAS ALTEN
WOUNDED BARNE WOUNDED DELANCEY KILLED VAN MEEREN KILLED OMPTEDA
KILLED THE WHOLE OF WELLINGTON'S STAFF DECIMATED AND ENGLAND HAD THE
WORSE OF IT IN THAT BLOODY SCALE
THE SECOND REGIMENT OF FOOT GUARDS
HAD LOST FIVE LIEUTENANT COLONELS FOUR CAPTAINS AND THREE ENSIGNS
THE FIRST BATTALION OF THE 30TH INFANTRY HAD LOST 24 OFFICERS AND 1 200
SOLDIERS THE 79TH HIGHLANDERS HAD LOST 24 OFFICERS WOUNDED 18 OFFICERS
KILLED 450 SOLDIERS KILLED
THE HANOVERIAN HUSSARS OF CUMBERLAND A
WHOLE REGIMENT WITH COLONEL HACKE AT ITS HEAD WHO WAS DESTINED TO BE
TRIED LATER ON AND CASHIERED HAD TURNED BRIDLE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE
FRAY AND HAD FLED TO THE FOREST OF SOIGNES SOWING DEFEAT ALL THE WAY
TO BRUSSELS
THE TRANSPORTS AMMUNITION WAGONS THE BAGGAGE WAGONS THE
WAGONS FILLED WITH WOUNDED ON PERCEIVING THAT THE FRENCH WERE GAINING
GROUND AND APPROACHING THE FOREST RUSHED HEADLONG THITHER
THE DUTCH
MOWED DOWN BY THE FRENCH CAVALRY CRIED ALARM FROM VERT COUCOU TO
GROENTENDAEL FOR A DISTANCE OF NEARLY TWO LEAGUES IN THE DIRECTION
OF BRUSSELS ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF EYE WITNESSES WHO ARE STILL
ALIVE THE ROADS WERE ENCUMBERED WITH FUGITIVES
THIS PANIC WAS SUCH
THAT IT ATTACKED THE PRINCE DE CONDE AT MECHLIN AND LOUIS XVIII
AT
GHENT
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FEEBLE RESERVE ECHELONNED BEHIND THE
AMBULANCE ESTABLISHED AT THE FARM OF MONT SAINT JEAN AND OF VIVIAN'S
AND VANDELEUR'S BRIGADES WHICH FLANKED THE LEFT WING WELLINGTON HAD
NO CAVALRY LEFT
A NUMBER OF BATTERIES LAY UNHORSED
THESE FACTS ARE
ATTESTED BY SIBORNE AND PRINGLE EXAGGERATING THE DISASTER GOES SO FAR
AS TO SAY THAT THE ANGLO DUTCH ARMY WAS REDUCED TO THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND
MEN
THE IRON DUKE REMAINED CALM BUT HIS LIPS BLANCHED
VINCENT THE
AUSTRIAN COMMISSIONER ALAVA THE SPANISH COMMISSIONER WHO WERE PRESENT
AT THE BATTLE IN THE ENGLISH STAFF THOUGHT THE DUKE LOST
AT FIVE
O'CLOCK WELLINGTON DREW OUT HIS WATCH AND HE WAS HEARD TO MURMUR THESE
SINISTER WORDS BLUCHER OR NIGHT
IT WAS AT ABOUT THAT MOMENT THAT A DISTANT LINE OF BAYONETS GLEAMED ON
THE HEIGHTS IN THE DIRECTION OF FRISCHEMONT
HERE COMES THE CHANGE OF FACE IN THIS GIANT DRAMA
CHAPTER XI A BAD GUIDE TO NAPOLEON A GOOD GUIDE TO BULOW
THE PAINFUL SURPRISE OF NAPOLEON IS WELL KNOWN
GROUCHY HOPED FOR
BLUCHER ARRIVING
DEATH INSTEAD OF LIFE
FATE HAS THESE TURNS THE THRONE OF THE WORLD WAS EXPECTED IT WAS SAINT
HELENA THAT WAS SEEN
IF THE LITTLE SHEPHERD WHO SERVED AS GUIDE TO BULOW BLUCHER'S
LIEUTENANT HAD ADVISED HIM TO DEBOUCH FROM THE FOREST ABOVE
FRISCHEMONT INSTEAD OF BELOW PLANCENOIT THE FORM OF THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
NAPOLEON WOULD HAVE WON THE
BATTLE OF WATERLOO
BY ANY OTHER ROUTE THAN THAT BELOW PLANCENOIT
THE PRUSSIAN ARMY WOULD HAVE COME OUT UPON A RAVINE IMPASSABLE FOR
ARTILLERY AND BULOW WOULD NOT HAVE ARRIVED
NOW THE PRUSSIAN GENERAL MUFFLING DECLARES THAT ONE HOUR'S DELAY AND
BLUCHER WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND WELLINGTON ON HIS FEET
THE BATTLE WAS
LOST
IT WAS TIME THAT BULOW SHOULD ARRIVE AS WILL BE SEEN
HE HAD MOREOVER
BEEN VERY MUCH DELAYED
HE HAD BIVOUACKED AT DION LE MONT AND HAD SET
OUT AT DAYBREAK BUT THE ROADS WERE IMPASSABLE AND HIS DIVISIONS STUCK
FAST IN THE MIRE
THE RUTS WERE UP TO THE HUBS OF THE CANNONS
MOREOVER
HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO PASS THE DYLE ON THE NARROW BRIDGE OF WAVRE
THE STREET LEADING TO THE BRIDGE HAD BEEN FIRED BY THE FRENCH SO
THE CAISSONS AND AMMUNITION WAGONS COULD NOT PASS BETWEEN TWO ROWS OF
BURNING HOUSES AND HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO WAIT UNTIL THE CONFLAGRATION WAS
EXTINGUISHED
IT WAS MID DAY BEFORE BULOW'S VANGUARD HAD BEEN ABLE TO
REACH CHAPELLE SAINT LAMBERT
HAD THE ACTION BEEN BEGUN TWO HOURS EARLIER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER
AT FOUR O'CLOCK AND BLUCHER WOULD HAVE FALLEN ON THE BATTLE WON BY
NAPOLEON
SUCH ARE THESE IMMENSE RISKS PROPORTIONED TO AN INFINITE WHICH
WE CANNOT COMPREHEND
THE EMPEROR HAD BEEN THE FIRST AS EARLY AS MID DAY TO DESCRY WITH HIS
FIELD GLASS ON THE EXTREME HORIZON SOMETHING WHICH HAD ATTRACTED HIS
ATTENTION
HE HAD SAID I SEE YONDER A CLOUD WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO BE
TROOPS THEN HE ASKED THE DUC DE DALMATIE SOULT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN
THE DIRECTION OF CHAPELLE SAINT LAMBERT THE MARSHAL LEVELLING HIS
GLASS ANSWERED FOUR OR FIVE THOUSAND MEN SIRE EVIDENTLY GROUCHY
BUT IT REMAINED MOTIONLESS IN THE MIST
ALL THE GLASSES OF THE STAFF
HAD STUDIED THE CLOUD POINTED OUT BY THE EMPEROR
SOME SAID IT IS
TREES THE TRUTH IS THAT THE CLOUD DID NOT MOVE
THE EMPEROR DETACHED
DOMON'S DIVISION OF LIGHT CAVALRY TO RECONNOITRE IN THAT QUARTER
BULOW HAD NOT MOVED IN FACT
HIS VANGUARD WAS VERY FEEBLE AND COULD
ACCOMPLISH NOTHING
HE WAS OBLIGED TO WAIT FOR THE BODY OF THE ARMY
CORPS AND HE HAD RECEIVED ORDERS TO CONCENTRATE HIS FORCES BEFORE
ENTERING INTO LINE BUT AT FIVE O'CLOCK PERCEIVING WELLINGTON'S PERIL
BLUCHER ORDERED BULOW TO ATTACK AND UTTERED THESE REMARKABLE WORDS WE
MUST GIVE AIR TO THE ENGLISH ARMY
A LITTLE LATER THE DIVISIONS OF LOSTHIN HILLER HACKE AND RYSSEL
DEPLOYED BEFORE LOBAU'S CORPS THE CAVALRY OF PRINCE WILLIAM OF PRUSSIA
DEBOUCHED FROM THE FOREST OF PARIS PLANCENOIT WAS IN FLAMES AND THE
PRUSSIAN CANNON BALLS BEGAN TO RAIN EVEN UPON THE RANKS OF THE GUARD IN
RESERVE BEHIND NAPOLEON
CHAPTER XII THE GUARD
EVERY ONE KNOWS THE REST THE IRRUPTION OF A THIRD ARMY THE BATTLE
BROKEN TO PIECES EIGHTY SIX MOUTHS OF FIRE THUNDERING SIMULTANEOUSLY
PIRCH THE FIRST COMING UP WITH BULOW ZIETEN'S CAVALRY LED BY BLUCHER
IN PERSON THE FRENCH DRIVEN BACK MARCOGNET SWEPT FROM THE PLATEAU OF
OHAIN DURUTTE DISLODGED FROM PAPELOTTE DONZELOT AND QUIOT RETREATING
LOBAU CAUGHT ON THE FLANK A FRESH BATTLE PRECIPITATING ITSELF ON OUR
DISMANTLED REGIMENTS AT NIGHTFALL THE WHOLE ENGLISH LINE RESUMING THE
OFFENSIVE AND THRUST FORWARD THE GIGANTIC BREACH MADE IN THE FRENCH
ARMY THE ENGLISH GRAPE SHOT AND THE PRUSSIAN GRAPE SHOT AIDING EACH
OTHER THE EXTERMINATION DISASTER IN FRONT DISASTER ON THE FLANK THE
GUARD ENTERING THE LINE IN THE MIDST OF THIS TERRIBLE CRUMBLING OF ALL
THINGS
CONSCIOUS THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO DIE THEY SHOUTED VIVE L'EMPEREUR
HISTORY RECORDS NOTHING MORE TOUCHING THAN THAT AGONY BURSTING FORTH IN
ACCLAMATIONS
THE SKY HAD BEEN OVERCAST ALL DAY LONG
ALL OF A SUDDEN AT THAT VERY
MOMENT IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE CLOUDS ON THE HORIZON
PARTED AND ALLOWED THE GRAND AND SINISTER GLOW OF THE SETTING SUN TO
PASS THROUGH ATHWART THE ELMS ON THE NIVELLES ROAD
THEY HAD SEEN IT
RISE AT AUSTERLITZ
EACH BATTALION OF THE GUARD WAS COMMANDED BY A GENERAL FOR THIS FINAL
CATASTROPHE
FRIANT MICHEL ROGUET HARLET MALLET PORET DE MORVAN
WERE THERE
WHEN THE TALL CAPS OF THE GRENADIERS OF THE GUARD WITH
THEIR LARGE PLAQUES BEARING THE EAGLE APPEARED SYMMETRICAL IN LINE
TRANQUIL IN THE MIDST OF THAT COMBAT THE ENEMY FELT A RESPECT FOR
FRANCE THEY THOUGHT THEY BEHELD TWENTY VICTORIES ENTERING THE FIELD
OF BATTLE WITH WINGS OUTSPREAD AND THOSE WHO WERE THE CONQUERORS
BELIEVING THEMSELVES TO BE VANQUISHED RETREATED BUT WELLINGTON
SHOUTED UP GUARDS AND AIM STRAIGHT THE RED REGIMENT OF ENGLISH
GUARDS LYING FLAT BEHIND THE HEDGES SPRANG UP A CLOUD OF GRAPE SHOT
RIDDLED THE TRICOLORED FLAG AND WHISTLED ROUND OUR EAGLES ALL HURLED
THEMSELVES FORWARDS AND THE FINAL CARNAGE BEGAN
IN THE DARKNESS THE
IMPERIAL GUARD FELT THE ARMY LOSING GROUND AROUND IT AND IN THE VAST
SHOCK OF THE ROUT IT HEARD THE DESPERATE FLIGHT WHICH HAD TAKEN THE
PLACE OF THE VIVE L'EMPEREUR AND WITH FLIGHT BEHIND IT IT CONTINUED
TO ADVANCE MORE CRUSHED LOSING MORE MEN AT EVERY STEP THAT IT TOOK
THERE WERE NONE WHO HESITATED NO TIMID MEN IN ITS RANKS
THE SOLDIER IN
THAT TROOP WAS AS MUCH OF A HERO AS THE GENERAL
NOT A MAN WAS MISSING
IN THAT SUICIDE
NEY BEWILDERED GREAT WITH ALL THE GRANDEUR OF ACCEPTED DEATH OFFERED
HIMSELF TO ALL BLOWS IN THAT TEMPEST
HE HAD HIS FIFTH HORSE KILLED
UNDER HIM THERE
PERSPIRING HIS EYES AFLAME FOAMING AT THE MOUTH WITH
UNIFORM UNBUTTONED ONE OF HIS EPAULETS HALF CUT OFF BY A SWORD STROKE
FROM A HORSEGUARD HIS PLAQUE WITH THE GREAT EAGLE DENTED BY A BULLET
BLEEDING BEMIRED MAGNIFICENT A BROKEN SWORD IN HIS HAND HE SAID
COME AND SEE HOW A MARSHAL OF FRANCE DIES ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE BUT
IN VAIN HE DID NOT DIE
HE WAS HAGGARD AND ANGRY
AT DROUET D'ERLON HE
HURLED THIS QUESTION ARE YOU NOT GOING TO GET YOURSELF KILLED IN
THE MIDST OF ALL THAT ARTILLERY ENGAGED IN CRUSHING A HANDFUL OF MEN
HE SHOUTED SO THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME OH I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ALL
THESE ENGLISH BULLETS ENTER MY BOWELS UNHAPPY MAN THOU WERT RESERVED
FOR FRENCH BULLETS
CHAPTER XIII THE CATASTROPHE
THE ROUT BEHIND THE GUARD WAS MELANCHOLY
THE ARMY YIELDED SUDDENLY ON ALL SIDES AT ONCE HOUGOMONT LA
HAIE SAINTE PAPELOTTE PLANCENOIT
THE CRY TREACHERY WAS FOLLOWED BY
A CRY OF SAVE YOURSELVES WHO CAN AN ARMY WHICH IS DISBANDING IS
LIKE A THAW
ALL YIELDS SPLITS CRACKS FLOATS ROLLS FALLS JOSTLES
HASTENS IS PRECIPITATED
THE DISINTEGRATION IS UNPRECEDENTED
NEY
BORROWS A HORSE LEAPS UPON IT AND WITHOUT HAT CRAVAT OR SWORD
PLACES HIMSELF ACROSS THE BRUSSELS ROAD STOPPING BOTH ENGLISH AND
FRENCH
HE STRIVES TO DETAIN THE ARMY HE RECALLS IT TO ITS DUTY HE
INSULTS IT HE CLINGS TO THE ROUT
HE IS OVERWHELMED
THE SOLDIERS FLY
FROM HIM SHOUTING LONG LIVE MARSHAL NEY TWO OF DURUTTE'S REGIMENTS
GO AND COME IN AFFRIGHT AS THOUGH TOSSED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE
SWORDS OF THE UHLANS AND THE FUSILLADE OF THE BRIGADES OF KEMPT BEST
PACK AND RYLANDT THE WORST OF HAND TO HAND CONFLICTS IS THE DEFEAT
FRIENDS KILL EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO ESCAPE SQUADRONS AND BATTALIONS
BREAK AND DISPERSE AGAINST EACH OTHER LIKE THE TREMENDOUS FOAM OF
BATTLE
LOBAU AT ONE EXTREMITY AND REILLE AT THE OTHER ARE DRAWN INTO
THE TIDE
IN VAIN DOES NAPOLEON ERECT WALLS FROM WHAT IS LEFT TO HIM OF
HIS GUARD IN VAIN DOES HE EXPEND IN A LAST EFFORT HIS LAST SERVICEABLE
SQUADRONS
QUIOT RETREATS BEFORE VIVIAN KELLERMANN BEFORE VANDELEUR
LOBAU BEFORE BULOW MORAND BEFORE PIRCH DOMON AND SUBERVIC BEFORE
PRINCE WILLIAM OF PRUSSIA GUYOT WHO LED THE EMPEROR'S SQUADRONS TO THE
CHARGE FALLS BENEATH THE FEET OF THE ENGLISH DRAGOONS
NAPOLEON GALLOPS
PAST THE LINE OF FUGITIVES HARANGUES URGES THREATENS ENTREATS
THEM
ALL THE MOUTHS WHICH IN THE MORNING HAD SHOUTED LONG LIVE
THE EMPEROR REMAIN GAPING THEY HARDLY RECOGNIZE HIM
THE PRUSSIAN
CAVALRY NEWLY ARRIVED DASHES FORWARDS FLIES HEWS SLASHES KILLS
EXTERMINATES
HORSES LASH OUT THE CANNONS FLEE THE SOLDIERS OF THE
ARTILLERY TRAIN UNHARNESS THE CAISSONS AND USE THE HORSES TO MAKE THEIR
ESCAPE TRANSPORTS OVERTURNED WITH ALL FOUR WHEELS IN THE AIR CLOG THE
ROAD AND OCCASION MASSACRES
MEN ARE CRUSHED TRAMPLED DOWN OTHERS WALK
OVER THE DEAD AND THE LIVING
ARMS ARE LOST
A DIZZY MULTITUDE FILLS THE
ROADS THE PATHS THE BRIDGES THE PLAINS THE HILLS THE VALLEYS
THE WOODS ENCUMBERED BY THIS INVASION OF FORTY THOUSAND MEN
SHOUTS
DESPAIR KNAPSACKS AND GUNS FLUNG AMONG THE RYE PASSAGES FORCED AT
THE POINT OF THE SWORD NO MORE COMRADES NO MORE OFFICERS NO MORE
GENERALS AN INEXPRESSIBLE TERROR
ZIETEN PUTTING FRANCE TO THE SWORD AT
ITS LEISURE
LIONS CONVERTED INTO GOATS
SUCH WAS THE FLIGHT
AT GENAPPE AN EFFORT WAS MADE TO WHEEL ABOUT TO PRESENT A BATTLE
FRONT TO DRAW UP IN LINE
LOBAU RALLIED THREE HUNDRED MEN
THE ENTRANCE
TO THE VILLAGE WAS BARRICADED BUT AT THE FIRST VOLLEY OF PRUSSIAN
CANISTER ALL TOOK TO FLIGHT AGAIN AND LOBAU WAS TAKEN
THAT VOLLEY OF
GRAPE SHOT CAN BE SEEN TO DAY IMPRINTED ON THE ANCIENT GABLE OF A BRICK
BUILDING ON THE RIGHT OF THE ROAD AT A FEW MINUTES' DISTANCE BEFORE YOU
ENTER GENAPPE
THE PRUSSIANS THREW THEMSELVES INTO GENAPPE FURIOUS NO
DOUBT THAT THEY WERE NOT MORE ENTIRELY THE CONQUERORS
THE PURSUIT WAS
STUPENDOUS
BLUCHER ORDERED EXTERMINATION
ROGUET HAD SET THE LUGUBRIOUS
EXAMPLE OF THREATENING WITH DEATH ANY FRENCH GRENADIER WHO SHOULD BRING
HIM A PRUSSIAN PRISONER
BLUCHER OUTDID ROGUET
DUHESME THE GENERAL
OF THE YOUNG GUARD HEMMED IN AT THE DOORWAY OF AN INN AT GENAPPE
SURRENDERED HIS SWORD TO A HUZZAR OF DEATH WHO TOOK THE SWORD AND SLEW
THE PRISONER
THE VICTORY WAS COMPLETED BY THE ASSASSINATION OF THE
VANQUISHED
LET US INFLICT PUNISHMENT SINCE WE ARE HISTORY OLD
BLUCHER DISGRACED HIMSELF
THIS FEROCITY PUT THE FINISHING TOUCH TO THE
DISASTER
THE DESPERATE ROUTE TRAVERSED GENAPPE TRAVERSED QUATRE BRAS
TRAVERSED GOSSELIES TRAVERSED FRASNES TRAVERSED CHARLEROI TRAVERSED
THUIN AND ONLY HALTED AT THE FRONTIER
ALAS AND WHO THEN WAS FLEEING
IN THAT MANNER THE GRAND ARMY
THIS VERTIGO THIS TERROR THIS DOWNFALL INTO RUIN OF THE LOFTIEST
BRAVERY WHICH EVER ASTOUNDED HISTORY IS THAT CAUSELESS NO
THE SHADOW
OF AN ENORMOUS RIGHT IS PROJECTED ATHWART WATERLOO
IT IS THE DAY OF
DESTINY
THE FORCE WHICH IS MIGHTIER THAN MAN PRODUCED THAT DAY
HENCE
THE TERRIFIED WRINKLE OF THOSE BROWS HENCE ALL THOSE GREAT SOULS
SURRENDERING THEIR SWORDS
THOSE WHO HAD CONQUERED EUROPE HAVE FALLEN
PRONE ON THE EARTH WITH NOTHING LEFT TO SAY NOR TO DO FEELING THE
PRESENT SHADOW OF A TERRIBLE PRESENCE
HOC ERAT IN FATIS
THAT DAY THE
PERSPECTIVE OF THE HUMAN RACE UNDERWENT A CHANGE
WATERLOO IS THE
HINGE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE GREAT MAN WAS
NECESSARY TO THE ADVENT OF THE GREAT CENTURY
SOME ONE A PERSON TO WHOM
ONE REPLIES NOT TOOK THE RESPONSIBILITY ON HIMSELF
THE PANIC OF HEROES
CAN BE EXPLAINED
IN THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN
A CLOUD THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE METEOR
GOD HAS PASSED BY
AT NIGHTFALL IN A MEADOW NEAR GENAPPE BERNARD AND BERTRAND SEIZED BY
THE SKIRT OF HIS COAT AND DETAINED A MAN HAGGARD PENSIVE SINISTER
GLOOMY WHO DRAGGED TO THAT POINT BY THE CURRENT OF THE ROUT HAD JUST
DISMOUNTED HAD PASSED THE BRIDLE OF HIS HORSE OVER HIS ARM AND WITH
WILD EYE WAS RETURNING ALONE TO WATERLOO
IT WAS NAPOLEON THE IMMENSE
SOMNAMBULIST OF THIS DREAM WHICH HAD CRUMBLED ESSAYING ONCE MORE TO
ADVANCE
CHAPTER XIV THE LAST SQUARE
SEVERAL SQUARES OF THE GUARD MOTIONLESS AMID THIS STREAM OF THE DEFEAT
AS ROCKS IN RUNNING WATER HELD THEIR OWN UNTIL NIGHT
NIGHT CAME
DEATH ALSO THEY AWAITED THAT DOUBLE SHADOW AND INVINCIBLE ALLOWED
THEMSELVES TO BE ENVELOPED THEREIN
EACH REGIMENT ISOLATED FROM THE
REST AND HAVING NO BOND WITH THE ARMY NOW SHATTERED IN EVERY PART
DIED ALONE
THEY HAD TAKEN UP POSITION FOR THIS FINAL ACTION SOME ON
THE HEIGHTS OF ROSSOMME OTHERS ON THE PLAIN OF MONT SAINT JEAN
THERE
ABANDONED VANQUISHED TERRIBLE THOSE GLOOMY SQUARES ENDURED THEIR
DEATH THROES IN FORMIDABLE FASHION
ULM WAGRAM JENA FRIEDLAND DIED
WITH THEM
AT TWILIGHT TOWARDS NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING ONE OF THEM WAS LEFT
AT THE FOOT OF THE PLATEAU OF MONT SAINT JEAN
IN THAT FATAL VALLEY
AT THE FOOT OF THAT DECLIVITY WHICH THE CUIRASSIERS HAD ASCENDED NOW
INUNDATED BY THE MASSES OF THE ENGLISH UNDER THE CONVERGING FIRES
OF THE VICTORIOUS HOSTILE CAVALRY UNDER A FRIGHTFUL DENSITY OF
PROJECTILES THIS SQUARE FOUGHT ON
IT WAS COMMANDED BY AN OBSCURE
OFFICER NAMED CAMBRONNE
AT EACH DISCHARGE THE SQUARE DIMINISHED AND
REPLIED
IT REPLIED TO THE GRAPE SHOT WITH A FUSILLADE CONTINUALLY
CONTRACTING ITS FOUR WALLS
THE FUGITIVES PAUSING BREATHLESS FOR A
MOMENT IN THE DISTANCE LISTENED IN THE DARKNESS TO THAT GLOOMY AND
EVER DECREASING THUNDER
WHEN THIS LEGION HAD BEEN REDUCED TO A HANDFUL WHEN NOTHING WAS LEFT
OF THEIR FLAG BUT A RAG WHEN THEIR GUNS THE BULLETS ALL GONE WERE NO
LONGER ANYTHING BUT CLUBS WHEN THE HEAP OF CORPSES WAS LARGER THAN THE
GROUP OF SURVIVORS THERE REIGNED AMONG THE CONQUERORS AROUND THOSE MEN
DYING SO SUBLIMELY A SORT OF SACRED TERROR AND THE ENGLISH ARTILLERY
TAKING BREATH BECAME SILENT
THIS FURNISHED A SORT OF RESPITE
THESE
COMBATANTS HAD AROUND THEM SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF A SWARM OF
SPECTRES SILHOUETTES OF MEN ON HORSEBACK THE BLACK PROFILES OF CANNON
THE WHITE SKY VIEWED THROUGH WHEELS AND GUN CARRIAGES THE COLOSSAL
DEATH'S HEAD WHICH THE HEROES SAW CONSTANTLY THROUGH THE SMOKE IN THE
DEPTHS OF THE BATTLE ADVANCED UPON THEM AND GAZED AT THEM
THROUGH THE
SHADES OF TWILIGHT THEY COULD HEAR THE PIECES BEING LOADED THE MATCHES
ALL LIGHTED LIKE THE EYES OF TIGERS AT NIGHT FORMED A CIRCLE ROUND
THEIR HEADS ALL THE LINTSTOCKS OF THE ENGLISH BATTERIES APPROACHED THE
CANNONS AND THEN WITH EMOTION HOLDING THE SUPREME MOMENT SUSPENDED
ABOVE THESE MEN AN ENGLISH GENERAL COLVILLE ACCORDING TO SOME
MAITLAND ACCORDING TO OTHERS SHOUTED TO THEM SURRENDER BRAVE
FRENCHMEN CAMBRONNE REPLIED
EDITOR'S COMMENTARY ANOTHER EDITION OF THIS BOOK HAS THE WORD MERDE
IN LIEU OF THE ABOVE
CHAPTER XV CAMBRONNE
IF ANY FRENCH READER OBJECT TO HAVING HIS SUSCEPTIBILITIES OFFENDED ONE
WOULD HAVE TO REFRAIN FROM REPEATING IN HIS PRESENCE WHAT IS PERHAPS
THE FINEST REPLY THAT A FRENCHMAN EVER MADE
THIS WOULD ENJOIN US FROM
CONSIGNING SOMETHING SUBLIME TO HISTORY
AT OUR OWN RISK AND PERIL LET US VIOLATE THIS INJUNCTION
NOW THEN AMONG THOSE GIANTS THERE WAS ONE TITAN CAMBRONNE
TO MAKE THAT REPLY AND THEN PERISH WHAT COULD BE GRANDER FOR BEING
WILLING TO DIE IS THE SAME AS TO DIE AND IT WAS NOT THIS MAN'S FAULT IF
HE SURVIVED AFTER HE WAS SHOT
THE WINNER OF THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO WAS NOT NAPOLEON WHO WAS PUT TO
FLIGHT NOR WELLINGTON GIVING WAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN DESPAIR AT FIVE
NOR BLUCHER WHO TOOK NO PART IN THE ENGAGEMENT
THE WINNER OF WATERLOO
WAS CAMBRONNE
TO THUNDER FORTH SUCH A REPLY AT THE LIGHTNING FLASH THAT KILLS YOU IS
TO CONQUER
THUS TO ANSWER THE CATASTROPHE THUS TO SPEAK TO FATE TO GIVE THIS
PEDESTAL TO THE FUTURE LION TO HURL SUCH A CHALLENGE TO THE MIDNIGHT
RAINSTORM TO THE TREACHEROUS WALL OF HOUGOMONT TO THE SUNKEN ROAD OF
OHAIN TO GROUCHY'S DELAY TO BLUCHER'S ARRIVAL TO BE IRONY ITSELF IN
THE TOMB TO ACT SO AS TO STAND UPRIGHT THOUGH FALLEN TO DROWN IN
TWO SYLLABLES THE EUROPEAN COALITION TO OFFER KINGS PRIVIES WHICH
THE CAESARS ONCE KNEW TO MAKE THE LOWEST OF WORDS THE MOST LOFTY BY
ENTWINING WITH IT THE GLORY OF FRANCE INSOLENTLY TO END WATERLOO WITH
MARDIGRAS TO FINISH LEONIDAS WITH RABELLAIS TO SET THE CROWN ON THIS
VICTORY BY A WORD IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK TO LOSE THE FIELD AND PRESERVE
HISTORY TO HAVE THE LAUGH ON YOUR SIDE AFTER SUCH A CARNAGE THIS IS
IMMENSE
IT WAS AN INSULT SUCH AS A THUNDER CLOUD MIGHT HURL IT REACHES THE
GRANDEUR OF AESCHYLUS
CAMBRONNE'S REPLY PRODUCES THE EFFECT OF A VIOLENT BREAK
'TIS LIKE THE
BREAKING OF A HEART UNDER A WEIGHT OF SCORN
'TIS THE OVERFLOW OF AGONY
BURSTING FORTH
WHO CONQUERED WELLINGTON NO HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR
BLUCHER HE WAS LOST
WAS IT BLUCHER NO IF WELLINGTON HAD NOT BEGUN
BLUCHER COULD NOT HAVE FINISHED
THIS CAMBRONNE THIS MAN SPENDING HIS
LAST HOUR THIS UNKNOWN SOLDIER THIS INFINITESIMAL OF WAR REALIZES
THAT HERE IS A FALSEHOOD A FALSEHOOD IN A CATASTROPHE AND SO DOUBLY
AGONIZING AND AT THE MOMENT WHEN HIS RAGE IS BURSTING FORTH BECAUSE OF
IT HE IS OFFERED THIS MOCKERY LIFE HOW COULD HE RESTRAIN HIMSELF
YONDER ARE ALL THE KINGS OF EUROPE THE GENERAL'S FLUSHED WITH VICTORY
THE JUPITER'S DARTING THUNDERBOLTS THEY HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND
VICTORIOUS SOLDIERS AND BACK OF THE HUNDRED THOUSAND A MILLION THEIR
CANNON STAND WITH YAWNING MOUTHS THE MATCH IS LIGHTED THEY GRIND DOWN
UNDER THEIR HEELS THE IMPERIAL GUARDS AND THE GRAND ARMY THEY HAVE
JUST CRUSHED NAPOLEON AND ONLY CAMBRONNE REMAINS ONLY THIS EARTHWORM
IS LEFT TO PROTEST
HE WILL PROTEST
THEN HE SEEKS FOR THE APPROPRIATE
WORD AS ONE SEEKS FOR A SWORD
HIS MOUTH FROTHS AND THE FROTH IS THE
WORD
IN FACE OF THIS MEAN AND MIGHTY VICTORY IN FACE OF THIS VICTORY
WHICH COUNTS NONE VICTORIOUS THIS DESPERATE SOLDIER STANDS ERECT
HE
GRANTS ITS OVERWHELMING IMMENSITY BUT HE ESTABLISHES ITS TRIVIALITY
AND HE DOES MORE THAN SPIT UPON IT
BORNE DOWN BY NUMBERS BY SUPERIOR
FORCE BY BRUTE MATTER HE FINDS IN HIS SOUL AN EXPRESSION EXCREMENT
WE REPEAT IT TO USE THAT WORD TO DO THUS TO INVENT SUCH AN
EXPRESSION IS TO BE THE CONQUEROR
THE SPIRIT OF MIGHTY DAYS AT THAT PORTENTOUS MOMENT MADE ITS DESCENT
ON THAT UNKNOWN MAN
CAMBRONNE INVENTS THE WORD FOR WATERLOO AS ROUGET
INVENTS THE MARSEILLAISE UNDER THE VISITATION OF A BREATH FROM ON
HIGH
AN EMANATION FROM THE DIVINE WHIRLWIND LEAPS FORTH AND COMES
SWEEPING OVER THESE MEN AND THEY SHAKE AND ONE OF THEM SINGS THE SONG
SUPREME AND THE OTHER UTTERS THE FRIGHTFUL CRY
THIS CHALLENGE OF TITANIC SCORN CAMBRONNE HURLS NOT ONLY AT EUROPE IN
THE NAME OF THE EMPIRE THAT WOULD BE A TRIFLE HE HURLS IT AT THE PAST
IN THE NAME OF THE REVOLUTION
IT IS HEARD AND CAMBRONNE IS RECOGNIZED
AS POSSESSED BY THE ANCIENT SPIRIT OF THE TITANS
DANTON SEEMS TO BE
SPEAKING KLEBER SEEMS TO BE BELLOWING
AT THAT WORD FROM CAMBRONNE THE ENGLISH VOICE RESPONDED FIRE
THE BATTERIES FLAMED THE HILL TREMBLED FROM ALL THOSE BRAZEN MOUTHS
BELCHED A LAST TERRIBLE GUSH OF GRAPE SHOT A VAST VOLUME OF SMOKE
VAGUELY WHITE IN THE LIGHT OF THE RISING MOON ROLLED OUT AND WHEN THE
SMOKE DISPERSED THERE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING THERE
THAT FORMIDABLE
REMNANT HAD BEEN ANNIHILATED THE GUARD WAS DEAD
THE FOUR WALLS OF THE
LIVING REDOUBT LAY PRONE AND HARDLY WAS THERE DISCERNIBLE HERE AND
THERE EVEN A QUIVER IN THE BODIES IT WAS THUS THAT THE FRENCH LEGIONS
GREATER THAN THE ROMAN LEGIONS EXPIRED ON MONT SAINT JEAN ON THE SOIL
WATERED WITH RAIN AND BLOOD AMID THE GLOOMY GRAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE
NOWADAYS JOSEPH WHO DRIVES THE POST WAGON FROM NIVELLES PASSES
WHISTLING AND CHEERFULLY WHIPPING UP HIS HORSE AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE
MORNING
CHAPTER XVI QUOT LIBRAS IN DUCE
THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO IS AN ENIGMA
IT IS AS OBSCURE TO THOSE WHO WON
IT AS TO THOSE WHO LOST IT
FOR NAPOLEON IT WAS A PANIC 10 BLUCHER
SEES NOTHING IN IT BUT FIRE WELLINGTON UNDERSTANDS NOTHING IN REGARD
TO IT
LOOK AT THE REPORTS
THE BULLETINS ARE CONFUSED THE COMMENTARIES
INVOLVED
SOME STAMMER OTHERS LISP
JOMINI DIVIDES THE BATTLE OF
WATERLOO INTO FOUR MOMENTS MUFFLING CUTS IT UP INTO THREE CHANGES
CHARRAS ALONE THOUGH WE HOLD ANOTHER JUDGMENT THAN HIS ON SOME POINTS
SEIZED WITH HIS HAUGHTY GLANCE THE CHARACTERISTIC OUTLINES OF THAT
CATASTROPHE OF HUMAN GENIUS IN CONFLICT WITH DIVINE CHANCE
ALL THE
OTHER HISTORIANS SUFFER FROM BEING SOMEWHAT DAZZLED AND IN THIS DAZZLED
STATE THEY FUMBLE ABOUT
IT WAS A DAY OF LIGHTNING BRILLIANCY IN FACT
A CRUMBLING OF THE MILITARY MONARCHY WHICH TO THE VAST STUPEFACTION OF
KINGS DREW ALL THE KINGDOMS AFTER IT THE FALL OF FORCE THE DEFEAT OF
WAR
IN THIS EVENT STAMPED WITH SUPERHUMAN NECESSITY THE PART PLAYED BY MEN
AMOUNTS TO NOTHING
IF WE TAKE WATERLOO FROM WELLINGTON AND BLUCHER DO WE THEREBY DEPRIVE
ENGLAND AND GERMANY OF ANYTHING NO
NEITHER THAT ILLUSTRIOUS ENGLAND
NOR THAT AUGUST GERMANY ENTER INTO THE PROBLEM OF WATERLOO
THANK
HEAVEN NATIONS ARE GREAT INDEPENDENTLY OF THE LUGUBRIOUS FEATS OF
THE SWORD
NEITHER ENGLAND NOR GERMANY NOR FRANCE IS CONTAINED IN
A SCABBARD
AT THIS EPOCH WHEN WATERLOO IS ONLY A CLASHING OF SWORDS
ABOVE BLUCHER GERMANY HAS SCHILLER ABOVE WELLINGTON ENGLAND HAS
BYRON
A VAST DAWN OF IDEAS IS THE PECULIARITY OF OUR CENTURY AND IN
THAT AURORA ENGLAND AND GERMANY HAVE A MAGNIFICENT RADIANCE
THEY
ARE MAJESTIC BECAUSE THEY THINK
THE ELEVATION OF LEVEL WHICH THEY
CONTRIBUTE TO CIVILIZATION IS INTRINSIC WITH THEM IT PROCEEDS FROM
THEMSELVES AND NOT FROM AN ACCIDENT
THE AGGRANDIZEMENT WHICH THEY HAVE
BROUGHT TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HAS NOT WATERLOO AS ITS SOURCE
IT IS
ONLY BARBAROUS PEOPLES WHO UNDERGO RAPID GROWTH AFTER A VICTORY
THAT IS
THE TEMPORARY VANITY OF TORRENTS SWELLED BY A STORM
CIVILIZED PEOPLE
ESPECIALLY IN OUR DAY ARE NEITHER ELEVATED NOR ABASED BY THE GOOD OR
BAD FORTUNE OF A CAPTAIN
THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY IN THE HUMAN SPECIES
RESULTS FROM SOMETHING MORE THAN A COMBAT
THEIR HONOR THANK GOD THEIR
DIGNITY THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR GENIUS ARE NOT NUMBERS WHICH THOSE
GAMBLERS HEROES AND CONQUERORS CAN PUT IN THE LOTTERY OF BATTLES
OFTEN A BATTLE IS LOST AND PROGRESS IS CONQUERED
THERE IS LESS GLORY
AND MORE LIBERTY
THE DRUM HOLDS ITS PEACE REASON TAKES THE WORD
IT IS
A GAME IN WHICH HE WHO LOSES WINS
LET US THEREFORE SPEAK OF WATERLOO
COLDLY FROM BOTH SIDES
LET US RENDER TO CHANCE THAT WHICH IS DUE
TO CHANCE AND TO GOD THAT WHICH IS DUE TO GOD
WHAT IS WATERLOO A
VICTORY NO
THE WINNING NUMBER IN THE LOTTERY
THE QUINE 11 WON BY EUROPE PAID BY FRANCE
IT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE TO PLACE A LION THERE
WATERLOO MOREOVER IS THE STRANGEST ENCOUNTER IN HISTORY
NAPOLEON AND
WELLINGTON
THEY ARE NOT ENEMIES THEY ARE OPPOSITES
NEVER DID GOD
WHO IS FOND OF ANTITHESES MAKE A MORE STRIKING CONTRAST A MORE
EXTRAORDINARY COMPARISON
ON ONE SIDE PRECISION FORESIGHT GEOMETRY
PRUDENCE AN ASSURED RETREAT RESERVES SPARED WITH AN OBSTINATE
COOLNESS AN IMPERTURBABLE METHOD STRATEGY WHICH TAKES ADVANTAGE
OF THE GROUND TACTICS WHICH PRESERVE THE EQUILIBRIUM OF BATTALIONS
CARNAGE EXECUTED ACCORDING TO RULE WAR REGULATED WATCH IN HAND
NOTHING VOLUNTARILY LEFT TO CHANCE THE ANCIENT CLASSIC COURAGE
ABSOLUTE REGULARITY ON THE OTHER INTUITION DIVINATION MILITARY
ODDITY SUPERHUMAN INSTINCT A FLAMING GLANCE AN INDESCRIBABLE
SOMETHING WHICH GAZES LIKE AN EAGLE AND WHICH STRIKES LIKE THE
LIGHTNING A PRODIGIOUS ART IN DISDAINFUL IMPETUOSITY ALL THE MYSTERIES
OF A PROFOUND SOUL ASSOCIATED WITH DESTINY THE STREAM THE PLAIN THE
FOREST THE HILL SUMMONED AND IN A MANNER FORCED TO OBEY THE DESPOT
GOING EVEN SO FAR AS TO TYRANNIZE OVER THE FIELD OF BATTLE FAITH IN
A STAR MINGLED WITH STRATEGIC SCIENCE ELEVATING BUT PERTURBING IT
WELLINGTON WAS THE BAREME OF WAR NAPOLEON WAS ITS MICHAEL ANGELO AND
ON THIS OCCASION GENIUS WAS VANQUISHED BY CALCULATION
ON BOTH SIDES
SOME ONE WAS AWAITED
IT WAS THE EXACT CALCULATOR WHO SUCCEEDED
NAPOLEON WAS WAITING FOR GROUCHY HE DID NOT COME
WELLINGTON EXPECTED
BLUCHER HE CAME
WELLINGTON IS CLASSIC WAR TAKING ITS REVENGE
BONAPARTE AT HIS DAWNING
HAD ENCOUNTERED HIM IN ITALY AND BEATEN HIM SUPERBLY
THE OLD OWL HAD
FLED BEFORE THE YOUNG VULTURE
THE OLD TACTICS HAD BEEN NOT ONLY STRUCK
AS BY LIGHTNING BUT DISGRACED
WHO WAS THAT CORSICAN OF SIX AND TWENTY
WHAT SIGNIFIED THAT SPLENDID IGNORAMUS WHO WITH EVERYTHING AGAINST
HIM NOTHING IN HIS FAVOR WITHOUT PROVISIONS WITHOUT AMMUNITION
WITHOUT CANNON WITHOUT SHOES ALMOST WITHOUT AN ARMY WITH A MERE
HANDFUL OF MEN AGAINST MASSES HURLED HIMSELF ON EUROPE COMBINED
AND ABSURDLY WON VICTORIES IN THE IMPOSSIBLE WHENCE HAD ISSUED THAT
FULMINATING CONVICT WHO ALMOST WITHOUT TAKING BREATH AND WITH THE SAME
SET OF COMBATANTS IN HAND PULVERIZED ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE FIVE
ARMIES OF THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY UPSETTING BEAULIEU ON ALVINZI WURMSER
ON BEAULIEU MELAS ON WURMSER MACK ON MELAS WHO WAS THIS NOVICE IN
WAR WITH THE EFFRONTERY OF A LUMINARY THE ACADEMICAL MILITARY SCHOOL
EXCOMMUNICATED HIM AND AS IT LOST ITS FOOTING HENCE THE IMPLACABLE
RANCOR OF THE OLD CAESARISM AGAINST THE NEW OF THE REGULAR SWORD
AGAINST THE FLAMING SWORD AND OF THE EXCHEQUER AGAINST GENIUS
ON THE
18TH OF JUNE 1815 THAT RANCOR HAD THE LAST WORD
AND BENEATH LODI
MONTEBELLO MONTENOTTE MANTUA ARCOLA IT WROTE WATERLOO
A TRIUMPH OF
THE MEDIOCRES WHICH IS SWEET TO THE MAJORITY
DESTINY CONSENTED TO THIS
IRONY
IN HIS DECLINE NAPOLEON FOUND WURMSER THE YOUNGER AGAIN IN
FRONT OF HIM
IN FACT TO GET WURMSER IT SUFFICED TO BLANCH THE HAIR OF WELLINGTON
WATERLOO IS A BATTLE OF THE FIRST ORDER WON BY A CAPTAIN OF THE SECOND
THAT WHICH MUST BE ADMIRED IN THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO IS ENGLAND THE
ENGLISH FIRMNESS THE ENGLISH RESOLUTION THE ENGLISH BLOOD THE SUPERB
THING ABOUT ENGLAND THERE NO OFFENCE TO HER WAS HERSELF
IT WAS NOT
HER CAPTAIN IT WAS HER ARMY
WELLINGTON ODDLY UNGRATEFUL DECLARES IN A LETTER TO LORD BATHURST
THAT HIS ARMY THE ARMY WHICH FOUGHT ON THE 18TH OF JUNE 1815 WAS A
DETESTABLE ARMY WHAT DOES THAT SOMBRE INTERMINGLING OF BONES BURIED
BENEATH THE FURROWS OF WATERLOO THINK OF THAT
ENGLAND HAS BEEN TOO MODEST IN THE MATTER OF WELLINGTON
TO MAKE
WELLINGTON SO GREAT IS TO BELITTLE ENGLAND
WELLINGTON IS NOTHING BUT
A HERO LIKE MANY ANOTHER
THOSE SCOTCH GRAYS THOSE HORSE GUARDS THOSE
REGIMENTS OF MAITLAND AND OF MITCHELL THAT INFANTRY OF PACK AND KEMPT
THAT CAVALRY OF PONSONBY AND SOMERSET THOSE HIGHLANDERS PLAYING THE
PIBROCH UNDER THE SHOWER OF GRAPE SHOT THOSE BATTALIONS OF RYLANDT
THOSE UTTERLY RAW RECRUITS WHO HARDLY KNEW HOW TO HANDLE A MUSKET
HOLDING THEIR OWN AGAINST ESSLING'S AND RIVOLI'S OLD TROOPS THAT IS
WHAT WAS GRAND
WELLINGTON WAS TENACIOUS IN THAT LAY HIS MERIT AND WE
ARE NOT SEEKING TO LESSEN IT BUT THE LEAST OF HIS FOOT SOLDIERS AND OF
HIS CAVALRY WOULD HAVE BEEN AS SOLID AS HE
THE IRON SOLDIER IS WORTH
AS MUCH AS THE IRON DUKE
AS FOR US ALL OUR GLORIFICATION GOES TO THE
ENGLISH SOLDIER TO THE ENGLISH ARMY TO THE ENGLISH PEOPLE
IF TROPHY
THERE BE IT IS TO ENGLAND THAT THE TROPHY IS DUE
THE COLUMN OF
WATERLOO WOULD BE MORE JUST IF INSTEAD OF THE FIGURE OF A MAN IT BORE
ON HIGH THE STATUE OF A PEOPLE
BUT THIS GREAT ENGLAND WILL BE ANGRY AT WHAT WE ARE SAYING HERE
SHE
STILL CHERISHES AFTER HER OWN 1688 AND OUR 1789 THE FEUDAL ILLUSION
SHE BELIEVES IN HEREDITY AND HIERARCHY
THIS PEOPLE SURPASSED BY NONE
IN POWER AND GLORY REGARDS ITSELF AS A NATION AND NOT AS A PEOPLE
AND
AS A PEOPLE IT WILLINGLY SUBORDINATES ITSELF AND TAKES A LORD FOR ITS
HEAD
AS A WORKMAN IT ALLOWS ITSELF TO BE DISDAINED AS A SOLDIER IT
ALLOWS ITSELF TO BE FLOGGED
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THE BATTLE OF INKERMANN A SERGEANT WHO
HAD IT APPEARS SAVED THE ARMY COULD NOT BE MENTIONED BY LORD PAGLAN
AS THE ENGLISH MILITARY HIERARCHY DOES NOT PERMIT ANY HERO BELOW THE
GRADE OF AN OFFICER TO BE MENTIONED IN THE REPORTS
THAT WHICH WE ADMIRE ABOVE ALL IN AN ENCOUNTER OF THE NATURE OF
WATERLOO IS THE MARVELLOUS CLEVERNESS OF CHANCE
A NOCTURNAL RAIN THE
WALL OF HOUGOMONT THE HOLLOW ROAD OF OHAIN GROUCHY DEAF TO THE CANNON
NAPOLEON'S GUIDE DECEIVING HIM BULOW'S GUIDE ENLIGHTENING HIM THE
WHOLE OF THIS CATACLYSM IS WONDERFULLY CONDUCTED
ON THE WHOLE LET US SAY IT PLAINLY IT WAS MORE OF A MASSACRE THAN OF A
BATTLE AT WATERLOO
OF ALL PITCHED BATTLES WATERLOO IS THE ONE WHICH HAS THE SMALLEST FRONT
FOR SUCH A NUMBER OF COMBATANTS
NAPOLEON THREE QUARTERS OF A LEAGUE
WELLINGTON HALF A LEAGUE SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND COMBATANTS ON EACH SIDE
FROM THIS DENSENESS THE CARNAGE AROSE
THE FOLLOWING CALCULATION HAS BEEN MADE AND THE FOLLOWING PROPORTION
ESTABLISHED LOSS OF MEN AT AUSTERLITZ FRENCH FOURTEEN PER CENT
RUSSIANS THIRTY PER CENT AUSTRIANS FORTY FOUR PER CENT
AT WAGRAM
FRENCH THIRTEEN PER CENT AUSTRIANS FOURTEEN
AT THE MOSKOWA FRENCH
THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT RUSSIANS FORTY FOUR
AT BAUTZEN FRENCH
THIRTEEN PER CENT RUSSIANS AND PRUSSIANS FOURTEEN
AT WATERLOO
FRENCH FIFTY SIX PER CENT THE ALLIES THIRTY ONE
TOTAL FOR WATERLOO
FORTY ONE PER CENT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND COMBATANTS
SIXTY THOUSAND DEAD
TO DAY THE FIELD OF WATERLOO HAS THE CALM WHICH BELONGS TO THE EARTH
THE IMPASSIVE SUPPORT OF MAN AND IT RESEMBLES ALL PLAINS
AT NIGHT MOREOVER A SORT OF VISIONARY MIST ARISES FROM IT AND IF A
TRAVELLER STROLLS THERE IF HE LISTENS IF HE WATCHES IF HE DREAMS
LIKE VIRGIL IN THE FATAL PLAINS OF PHILIPPI THE HALLUCINATION OF THE
CATASTROPHE TAKES POSSESSION OF HIM
THE FRIGHTFUL 18TH OF JUNE LIVES
AGAIN THE FALSE MONUMENTAL HILLOCK DISAPPEARS THE LION VANISHES IN
AIR THE BATTLE FIELD RESUMES ITS REALITY LINES OF INFANTRY UNDULATE
OVER THE PLAIN FURIOUS GALLOPS TRAVERSE THE HORIZON THE FRIGHTENED
DREAMER BEHOLDS THE FLASH OF SABRES THE GLEAM OF BAYONETS THE FLARE OF
BOMBS THE TREMENDOUS INTERCHANGE OF THUNDERS HE HEARS AS IT WERE
THE DEATH RATTLE IN THE DEPTHS OF A TOMB THE VAGUE CLAMOR OF THE BATTLE
PHANTOM THOSE SHADOWS ARE GRENADIERS THOSE LIGHTS ARE CUIRASSIERS
THAT SKELETON NAPOLEON THAT OTHER SKELETON IS WELLINGTON ALL THIS NO
LONGER EXISTS AND YET IT CLASHES TOGETHER AND COMBATS STILL AND THE
RAVINES ARE EMPURPLED AND THE TREES QUIVER AND THERE IS FURY EVEN IN
THE CLOUDS AND IN THE SHADOWS ALL THOSE TERRIBLE HEIGHTS HOUGOMONT
MONT SAINT JEAN FRISCHEMONT PAPELOTTE PLANCENOIT APPEAR CONFUSEDLY
CROWNED WITH WHIRLWINDS OF SPECTRES ENGAGED IN EXTERMINATING EACH OTHER
CHAPTER XVII IS WATERLOO TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD
THERE EXISTS A VERY RESPECTABLE LIBERAL SCHOOL WHICH DOES NOT HATE
WATERLOO
WE DO NOT BELONG TO IT
TO US WATERLOO IS BUT THE STUPEFIED
DATE OF LIBERTY
THAT SUCH AN EAGLE SHOULD EMERGE FROM SUCH AN EGG IS
CERTAINLY UNEXPECTED
IF ONE PLACES ONE'S SELF AT THE CULMINATING POINT OF VIEW OF THE
QUESTION WATERLOO IS INTENTIONALLY A COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY VICTORY
IT
IS EUROPE AGAINST FRANCE IT IS PETERSBURG BERLIN AND VIENNA AGAINST
PARIS IT IS THE STATU QUO AGAINST THE INITIATIVE IT IS THE 14TH
OF JULY 1789 ATTACKED THROUGH THE 20TH OF MARCH 1815 IT IS THE
MONARCHIES CLEARING THE DECKS IN OPPOSITION TO THE INDOMITABLE FRENCH
RIOTING
THE FINAL EXTINCTION OF THAT VAST PEOPLE WHICH HAD BEEN IN
ERUPTION FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS SUCH WAS THE DREAM
THE SOLIDARITY OF THE
BRUNSWICKS THE NASSAUS THE ROMANOFFS THE HOHENZOLLERNS THE HAPSBURGS
WITH THE BOURBONS
WATERLOO BEARS DIVINE RIGHT ON ITS CRUPPER
IT IS
TRUE THAT THE EMPIRE HAVING BEEN DESPOTIC THE KINGDOM BY THE NATURAL
REACTION OF THINGS WAS FORCED TO BE LIBERAL AND THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL
ORDER WAS THE UNWILLING RESULT OF WATERLOO TO THE GREAT REGRET OF THE
CONQUERORS
IT IS BECAUSE REVOLUTION CANNOT BE REALLY CONQUERED AND
THAT BEING PROVIDENTIAL AND ABSOLUTELY FATAL IT IS ALWAYS CROPPING
UP AFRESH BEFORE WATERLOO IN BONAPARTE OVERTHROWING THE OLD THRONES
AFTER WATERLOO IN LOUIS XVIII
GRANTING AND CONFORMING TO THE CHARTER
BONAPARTE PLACES A POSTILION ON THE THRONE OF NAPLES AND A SERGEANT
ON THE THRONE OF SWEDEN EMPLOYING INEQUALITY TO DEMONSTRATE EQUALITY
LOUIS XVIII
AT SAINT OUEN COUNTERSIGNS THE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS
OF MAN
IF YOU WISH TO GAIN AN IDEA OF WHAT REVOLUTION IS CALL IT
PROGRESS AND IF YOU WISH TO ACQUIRE AN IDEA OF THE NATURE OF PROGRESS
CALL IT TO MORROW
TO MORROW FULFILS ITS WORK IRRESISTIBLY AND IT IS
ALREADY FULFILLING IT TO DAY
IT ALWAYS REACHES ITS GOAL STRANGELY
IT
EMPLOYS WELLINGTON TO MAKE OF FOY WHO WAS ONLY A SOLDIER AN ORATOR
FOY FALLS AT HOUGOMONT AND RISES AGAIN IN THE TRIBUNE
THUS DOES
PROGRESS PROCEED
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BAD TOOL FOR THAT WORKMAN
IT DOES NOT BECOME DISCONCERTED BUT ADJUSTS TO ITS DIVINE WORK THE
MAN WHO HAS BESTRIDDEN THE ALPS AND THE GOOD OLD TOTTERING INVALID
OF FATHER ELYSEE
IT MAKES USE OF THE GOUTY MAN AS WELL AS OF THE
CONQUEROR OF THE CONQUEROR WITHOUT OF THE GOUTY MAN WITHIN
WATERLOO
BY CUTTING SHORT THE DEMOLITION OF EUROPEAN THRONES BY THE SWORD HAD
NO OTHER EFFECT THAN TO CAUSE THE REVOLUTIONARY WORK TO BE CONTINUED IN
ANOTHER DIRECTION
THE SLASHERS HAVE FINISHED IT WAS THE TURN OF THE
THINKERS
THE CENTURY THAT WATERLOO WAS INTENDED TO ARREST HAS PURSUED
ITS MARCH
THAT SINISTER VICTORY WAS VANQUISHED BY LIBERTY
IN SHORT AND INCONTESTABLY THAT WHICH TRIUMPHED AT WATERLOO THAT
WHICH SMILED IN WELLINGTON'S REAR THAT WHICH BROUGHT HIM ALL THE
MARSHALS' STAFFS OF EUROPE INCLUDING IT IS SAID THE STAFF OF A
MARSHAL OF FRANCE THAT WHICH JOYOUSLY TRUNDLED THE BARROWS FULL OF
BONES TO ERECT THE KNOLL OF THE LION THAT WHICH TRIUMPHANTLY INSCRIBED
ON THAT PEDESTAL THE DATE JUNE 18 1815 THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED
BLUCHER AS HE PUT THE FLYING ARMY TO THE SWORD THAT WHICH FROM THE
HEIGHTS OF THE PLATEAU OF MONT SAINT JEAN HOVERED OVER FRANCE AS OVER
ITS PREY WAS THE COUNTER REVOLUTION
IT WAS THE COUNTER REVOLUTION
WHICH MURMURED THAT INFAMOUS WORD DISMEMBERMENT ON ARRIVING IN PARIS
IT BEHELD THE CRATER CLOSE AT HAND IT FELT THOSE ASHES WHICH SCORCHED
ITS FEET AND IT CHANGED ITS MIND IT RETURNED TO THE STAMMER OF A
CHARTER
LET US BEHOLD IN WATERLOO ONLY THAT WHICH IS IN WATERLOO
OF INTENTIONAL
LIBERTY THERE IS NONE
THE COUNTER REVOLUTION WAS INVOLUNTARILY LIBERAL
IN THE SAME MANNER AS BY A CORRESPONDING PHENOMENON NAPOLEON WAS
INVOLUNTARILY REVOLUTIONARY
ON THE 18TH OF JUNE 1815 THE MOUNTED
ROBESPIERRE WAS HURLED FROM HIS SADDLE
CHAPTER XVIII A RECRUDESCENCE OF DIVINE RIGHT
END OF THE DICTATORSHIP
A WHOLE EUROPEAN SYSTEM CRUMBLED AWAY
THE EMPIRE SANK INTO A GLOOM WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF THE ROMAN WORLD AS
IT EXPIRED
AGAIN WE BEHOLD THE ABYSS AS IN THE DAYS OF THE BARBARIANS
ONLY THE BARBARISM OF 1815 WHICH MUST BE CALLED BY ITS PET NAME OF THE
COUNTER REVOLUTION WAS NOT LONG BREATHED SOON FELL TO PANTING AND
HALTED SHORT
THE EMPIRE WAS BEWEPT LET US ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT AND
BEWEPT BY HEROIC EYES
IF GLORY LIES IN THE SWORD CONVERTED INTO A
SCEPTRE THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN GLORY IN PERSON
IT HAD DIFFUSED OVER THE
EARTH ALL THE LIGHT WHICH TYRANNY CAN GIVE A SOMBRE LIGHT
WE WILL SAY
MORE AN OBSCURE LIGHT
COMPARED TO THE TRUE DAYLIGHT IT IS NIGHT
THIS
DISAPPEARANCE OF NIGHT PRODUCES THE EFFECT OF AN ECLIPSE
LOUIS XVIII
RE ENTERED PARIS
THE CIRCLING DANCES OF THE 8TH OF JULY
EFFACED THE ENTHUSIASMS OF THE 20TH OF MARCH
THE CORSICAN BECAME THE
ANTITHESIS OF THE BEARNESE
THE FLAG ON THE DOME OF THE TUILERIES WAS
WHITE
THE EXILE REIGNED
HARTWELL'S PINE TABLE TOOK ITS PLACE IN FRONT
OF THE FLEUR DE LYS STREWN THRONE OF LOUIS XIV
BOUVINES AND FONTENOY
WERE MENTIONED AS THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN PLACE ON THE PRECEDING
DAY AUSTERLITZ HAVING BECOME ANTIQUATED
THE ALTAR AND THE THRONE
FRATERNIZED MAJESTICALLY
ONE OF THE MOST UNDISPUTED FORMS OF THE HEALTH
OF SOCIETY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WAS ESTABLISHED OVER FRANCE AND
OVER THE CONTINENT
EUROPE ADOPTED THE WHITE COCKADE
TRESTAILLON WAS
CELEBRATED
THE DEVICE NON PLURIBUS IMPAR RE APPEARED ON THE STONE RAYS
REPRESENTING A SUN UPON THE FRONT OF THE BARRACKS ON THE QUAI D'ORSAY
WHERE THERE HAD BEEN AN IMPERIAL GUARD THERE WAS NOW A RED HOUSE
THE
ARC DU CARROUSEL ALL LADEN WITH BADLY BORNE VICTORIES THROWN OUT
OF ITS ELEMENT AMONG THESE NOVELTIES A LITTLE ASHAMED IT MAY BE OF
MARENGO AND ARCOLA EXTRICATED ITSELF FROM ITS PREDICAMENT WITH THE
STATUE OF THE DUC D'ANGOULEME
THE CEMETERY OF THE MADELEINE A TERRIBLE
PAUPER'S GRAVE IN 1793 WAS COVERED WITH JASPER AND MARBLE SINCE THE
BONES OF LOUIS XVI
AND MARIE ANTOINETTE LAY IN THAT DUST
IN THE MOAT OF VINCENNES A SEPULCHRAL SHAFT SPRANG FROM THE EARTH
RECALLING THE FACT THAT THE DUC D'ENGHIEN HAD PERISHED IN THE VERY
MONTH WHEN NAPOLEON WAS CROWNED
POPE PIUS VII WHO HAD PERFORMED THE
CORONATION VERY NEAR THIS DEATH TRANQUILLY BESTOWED HIS BLESSING ON THE
FALL AS HE HAD BESTOWED IT ON THE ELEVATION
AT SCHOENBRUNN THERE WAS
A LITTLE SHADOW AGED FOUR WHOM IT WAS SEDITIOUS TO CALL THE KING OF
ROME
AND THESE THINGS TOOK PLACE AND THE KINGS RESUMED THEIR THRONES
AND THE MASTER OF EUROPE WAS PUT IN A CAGE AND THE OLD REGIME BECAME
THE NEW REGIME AND ALL THE SHADOWS AND ALL THE LIGHT OF THE EARTH
CHANGED PLACE BECAUSE ON THE AFTERNOON OF A CERTAIN SUMMER'S DAY A
SHEPHERD SAID TO A PRUSSIAN IN THE FOREST GO THIS WAY AND NOT THAT
THIS 1815 WAS A SORT OF LUGUBRIOUS APRIL
ANCIENT UNHEALTHY AND
POISONOUS REALITIES WERE COVERED WITH NEW APPEARANCES
A LIE WEDDED
1789 THE RIGHT DIVINE WAS MASKED UNDER A CHARTER FICTIONS BECAME
CONSTITUTIONAL PREJUDICES SUPERSTITIONS AND MENTAL RESERVATIONS WITH
ARTICLE 14 IN THE HEART WERE VARNISHED OVER WITH LIBERALISM
IT WAS THE
SERPENT'S CHANGE OF SKIN
MAN HAD BEEN RENDERED BOTH GREATER AND SMALLER BY NAPOLEON
UNDER THIS
REIGN OF SPLENDID MATTER THE IDEAL HAD RECEIVED THE STRANGE NAME OF
IDEOLOGY IT IS A GRAVE IMPRUDENCE IN A GREAT MAN TO TURN THE FUTURE
INTO DERISION
THE POPULACE HOWEVER THAT FOOD FOR CANNON WHICH IS SO
FOND OF THE CANNONEER SOUGHT HIM WITH ITS GLANCE
WHERE IS HE WHAT IS
HE DOING NAPOLEON IS DEAD SAID A PASSER BY TO A VETERAN OF MARENGO
AND WATERLOO
HE DEAD CRIED THE SOLDIER YOU DON'T KNOW HIM
IMAGINATION DISTRUSTED THIS MAN EVEN WHEN OVERTHROWN
THE DEPTHS OF
EUROPE WERE FULL OF DARKNESS AFTER WATERLOO
SOMETHING ENORMOUS REMAINED
LONG EMPTY THROUGH NAPOLEON'S DISAPPEARANCE
THE KINGS PLACED THEMSELVES IN THIS VOID
ANCIENT EUROPE PROFITED BY
IT TO UNDERTAKE REFORMS
THERE WAS A HOLY ALLIANCE BELLE ALLIANCE
BEAUTIFUL ALLIANCE THE FATAL FIELD OF WATERLOO HAD SAID IN ADVANCE
IN PRESENCE AND IN FACE OF THAT ANTIQUE EUROPE RECONSTRUCTED THE
FEATURES OF A NEW FRANCE WERE SKETCHED OUT
THE FUTURE WHICH THE
EMPEROR HAD RALLIED MADE ITS ENTRY
ON ITS BROW IT BORE THE STAR
LIBERTY
THE GLOWING EYES OF ALL YOUNG GENERATIONS WERE TURNED ON IT
SINGULAR FACT PEOPLE WERE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME IN LOVE WITH
THE FUTURE LIBERTY AND THE PAST NAPOLEON
DEFEAT HAD RENDERED THE
VANQUISHED GREATER
BONAPARTE FALLEN SEEMED MORE LOFTY THAN NAPOLEON
ERECT
THOSE WHO HAD TRIUMPHED WERE ALARMED
ENGLAND HAD HIM GUARDED BY
HUDSON LOWE AND FRANCE HAD HIM WATCHED BY MONTCHENU
HIS FOLDED ARMS
BECAME A SOURCE OF UNEASINESS TO THRONES
ALEXANDER CALLED HIM MY
SLEEPLESSNESS THIS TERROR WAS THE RESULT OF THE QUANTITY OF
REVOLUTION WHICH WAS CONTAINED IN HIM
THAT IS WHAT EXPLAINS AND EXCUSES
BONAPARTIST LIBERALISM
THIS PHANTOM CAUSED THE OLD WORLD TO TREMBLE
THE KINGS REIGNED BUT ILL AT THEIR EASE WITH THE ROCK OF SAINT HELENA
ON THE HORIZON
WHILE NAPOLEON WAS PASSING THROUGH THE DEATH STRUGGLE AT LONGWOOD THE
SIXTY THOUSAND MEN WHO HAD FALLEN ON THE FIELD OF WATERLOO WERE QUIETLY
ROTTING AND SOMETHING OF THEIR PEACE WAS SHED ABROAD OVER THE WORLD
THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA MADE THE TREATIES IN 1815 AND EUROPE CALLED THIS
THE RESTORATION
THIS IS WHAT WATERLOO WAS
BUT WHAT MATTERS IT TO THE INFINITE ALL THAT TEMPEST ALL THAT CLOUD
THAT WAR THEN THAT PEACE ALL THAT DARKNESS DID NOT TROUBLE FOR A
MOMENT THE LIGHT OF THAT IMMENSE EYE BEFORE WHICH A GRUB SKIPPING FROM
ONE BLADE OF GRASS TO ANOTHER EQUALS THE EAGLE SOARING FROM BELFRY TO
BELFRY ON THE TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME
CHAPTER XIX THE BATTLE FIELD AT NIGHT
LET US RETURN IT IS A NECESSITY IN THIS BOOK TO THAT FATAL
BATTLE FIELD
ON THE 18TH OF JUNE THE MOON WAS FULL
ITS LIGHT FAVORED BLUCHER'S
FEROCIOUS PURSUIT BETRAYED THE TRACES OF THE FUGITIVES DELIVERED
UP THAT DISASTROUS MASS TO THE EAGER PRUSSIAN CAVALRY AND AIDED THE
MASSACRE
SUCH TRAGIC FAVORS OF THE NIGHT DO OCCUR SOMETIMES DURING
CATASTROPHES
AFTER THE LAST CANNON SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED THE PLAIN OF MONT SAINT JEAN
REMAINED DESERTED
THE ENGLISH OCCUPIED THE ENCAMPMENT OF THE FRENCH IT IS THE USUAL SIGN
OF VICTORY TO SLEEP IN THE BED OF THE VANQUISHED
THEY ESTABLISHED THEIR
BIVOUAC BEYOND ROSSOMME
THE PRUSSIANS LET LOOSE ON THE RETREATING
ROUT PUSHED FORWARD
WELLINGTON WENT TO THE VILLAGE OF WATERLOO TO DRAW
UP HIS REPORT TO LORD BATHURST
IF EVER THE SIC VOS NON VOBIS WAS APPLICABLE IT CERTAINLY IS TO THAT
VILLAGE OF WATERLOO
WATERLOO TOOK NO PART AND LAY HALF A LEAGUE FROM
THE SCENE OF ACTION
MONT SAINT JEAN WAS CANNONADED HOUGOMONT WAS
BURNED LA HAIE SAINTE WAS TAKEN BY ASSAULT PAPELOTTE WAS BURNED
PLANCENOIT WAS BURNED LA BELLE ALLIANCE BEHELD THE EMBRACE OF THE TWO
CONQUERORS THESE NAMES ARE HARDLY KNOWN AND WATERLOO WHICH WORKED NOT
IN THE BATTLE BEARS OFF ALL THE HONOR
WE ARE NOT OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO FLATTER WAR WHEN THE OCCASION
PRESENTS ITSELF WE TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT
WAR HAS FRIGHTFUL BEAUTIES
WHICH WE HAVE NOT CONCEALED IT HAS ALSO WE ACKNOWLEDGE SOME HIDEOUS
FEATURES
ONE OF THE MOST SURPRISING IS THE PROMPT STRIPPING OF THE
BODIES OF THE DEAD AFTER THE VICTORY
THE DAWN WHICH FOLLOWS A BATTLE
ALWAYS RISES ON NAKED CORPSES
WHO DOES THIS WHO THUS SOILS THE TRIUMPH WHAT HIDEOUS FURTIVE HAND IS
THAT WHICH IS SLIPPED INTO THE POCKET OF VICTORY WHAT PICKPOCKETS
ARE THEY WHO PLY THEIR TRADE IN THE REAR OF GLORY SOME
PHILOSOPHERS VOLTAIRE AMONG THE NUMBER AFFIRM THAT IT IS PRECISELY
THOSE PERSONS HAVE MADE THE GLORY
IT IS THE SAME MEN THEY SAY THERE
IS NO RELIEF CORPS THOSE WHO ARE ERECT PILLAGE THOSE WHO ARE PRONE
ON THE EARTH
THE HERO OF THE DAY IS THE VAMPIRE OF THE NIGHT
ONE HAS
ASSUREDLY THE RIGHT AFTER ALL TO STRIP A CORPSE A BIT WHEN ONE IS THE
AUTHOR OF THAT CORPSE
FOR OUR OWN PART WE DO NOT THINK SO IT SEEMS
TO US IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE SAME HAND SHOULD PLUCK LAURELS AND PURLOIN THE
SHOES FROM A DEAD MAN
ONE THING IS CERTAIN WHICH IS THAT GENERALLY AFTER CONQUERORS FOLLOW
THIEVES
BUT LET US LEAVE THE SOLDIER ESPECIALLY THE CONTEMPORARY
SOLDIER OUT OF THE QUESTION
EVERY ARMY HAS A REAR GUARD AND IT IS THAT WHICH MUST BE BLAMED
BAT LIKE CREATURES HALF BRIGANDS AND LACKEYS ALL THE SORTS OF
VESPERTILLOS THAT THAT TWILIGHT CALLED WAR ENGENDERS WEARERS OF
UNIFORMS WHO TAKE NO PART IN THE FIGHTING PRETENDED INVALIDS
FORMIDABLE LIMPERS INTERLOPING SUTLERS TROTTING ALONG IN LITTLE CARTS
SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR WIVES AND STEALING THINGS WHICH THEY
SELL AGAIN BEGGARS OFFERING THEMSELVES AS GUIDES TO OFFICERS SOLDIERS'
SERVANTS MARAUDERS ARMIES ON THE MARCH IN DAYS GONE BY WE ARE NOT
SPEAKING OF THE PRESENT DRAGGED ALL THIS BEHIND THEM SO THAT IN THE
SPECIAL LANGUAGE THEY ARE CALLED STRAGGLERS NO ARMY NO NATION
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE BEINGS THEY SPOKE ITALIAN AND FOLLOWED THE
GERMANS THEN SPOKE FRENCH AND FOLLOWED THE ENGLISH
IT WAS BY ONE OF
THESE WRETCHES A SPANISH STRAGGLER WHO SPOKE FRENCH THAT THE MARQUIS
OF FERVACQUES DECEIVED BY HIS PICARD JARGON AND TAKING HIM FOR ONE
OF OUR OWN MEN WAS TRAITOROUSLY SLAIN AND ROBBED ON THE BATTLE FIELD
ITSELF IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT WHICH FOLLOWED THE VICTORY OF
CERISOLES
THE RASCAL SPRANG FROM THIS MARAUDING
THE DETESTABLE MAXIM
LIVE ON THE ENEMY PRODUCED THIS LEPROSY WHICH A STRICT DISCIPLINE
ALONE COULD HEAL
THERE ARE REPUTATIONS WHICH ARE DECEPTIVE ONE DOES
NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHY CERTAIN GENERALS GREAT IN OTHER DIRECTIONS HAVE
BEEN SO POPULAR
TURENNE WAS ADORED BY HIS SOLDIERS BECAUSE HE TOLERATED
PILLAGE EVIL PERMITTED CONSTITUTES PART OF GOODNESS
TURENNE WAS SO
GOOD THAT HE ALLOWED THE PALATINATE TO BE DELIVERED OVER TO FIRE AND
BLOOD
THE MARAUDERS IN THE TRAIN OF AN ARMY WERE MORE OR LESS IN
NUMBER ACCORDING AS THE CHIEF WAS MORE OR LESS SEVERE
HOCHE AND
MARCEAU HAD NO STRAGGLERS WELLINGTON HAD FEW AND WE DO HIM THE JUSTICE
TO MENTION IT
NEVERTHELESS ON THE NIGHT FROM THE 18TH TO THE 19TH OF JUNE THE DEAD
WERE ROBBED
WELLINGTON WAS RIGID HE GAVE ORDERS THAT ANY ONE CAUGHT IN
THE ACT SHOULD BE SHOT BUT RAPINE IS TENACIOUS
THE MARAUDERS STOLE IN
ONE CORNER OF THE BATTLEFIELD WHILE OTHERS WERE BEING SHOT IN ANOTHER
THE MOON WAS SINISTER OVER THIS PLAIN
TOWARDS MIDNIGHT A MAN WAS PROWLING ABOUT OR RATHER CLIMBING IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE HOLLOW ROAD OF OHAIN
TO ALL APPEARANCE HE WAS ONE OF
THOSE WHOM WE HAVE JUST DESCRIBED NEITHER ENGLISH NOR FRENCH NEITHER
PEASANT NOR SOLDIER LESS A MAN THAN A GHOUL ATTRACTED BY THE SCENT
OF THE DEAD BODIES HAVING THEFT FOR HIS VICTORY AND COME TO RIFLE
WATERLOO
HE WAS CLAD IN A BLOUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING LIKE A GREAT COAT
HE WAS UNEASY AND AUDACIOUS HE WALKED FORWARDS AND GAZED BEHIND HIM
WHO WAS THIS MAN THE NIGHT PROBABLY KNEW MORE OF HIM THAN THE DAY
HE
HAD NO SACK BUT EVIDENTLY HE HAD LARGE POCKETS UNDER HIS COAT
FROM
TIME TO TIME HE HALTED SCRUTINIZED THE PLAIN AROUND HIM AS THOUGH TO
SEE WHETHER HE WERE OBSERVED BENT OVER ABRUPTLY DISTURBED SOMETHING
SILENT AND MOTIONLESS ON THE GROUND THEN ROSE AND FLED
HIS SLIDING
MOTION HIS ATTITUDES HIS MYSTERIOUS AND RAPID GESTURES CAUSED HIM
TO RESEMBLE THOSE TWILIGHT LARVAE WHICH HAUNT RUINS AND WHICH ANCIENT
NORMAN LEGENDS CALL THE ALLEURS
CERTAIN NOCTURNAL WADING BIRDS PRODUCE THESE SILHOUETTES AMONG THE
MARSHES
A GLANCE CAPABLE OF PIERCING ALL THAT MIST DEEPLY WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED
AT SOME DISTANCE A SORT OF LITTLE SUTLER'S WAGON WITH A FLUTED WICKER
HOOD HARNESSED TO A FAMISHED NAG WHICH WAS CROPPING THE GRASS ACROSS
ITS BIT AS IT HALTED HIDDEN AS IT WERE BEHIND THE HOVEL WHICH ADJOINS
THE HIGHWAY TO NIVELLES AT THE ANGLE OF THE ROAD FROM MONT SAINT JEAN
TO BRAINE L'ALLEUD AND IN THE WAGON A SORT OF WOMAN SEATED ON COFFERS
AND PACKAGES
PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT WAGON AND
THAT PROWLER
THE DARKNESS WAS SERENE
NOT A CLOUD IN THE ZENITH
WHAT MATTERS IT IF
THE EARTH BE RED THE MOON REMAINS WHITE THESE ARE THE INDIFFERENCES OF
THE SKY
IN THE FIELDS BRANCHES OF TREES BROKEN BY GRAPE SHOT BUT NOT
FALLEN UPHELD BY THEIR BARK SWAYED GENTLY IN THE BREEZE OF NIGHT
A BREATH ALMOST A RESPIRATION MOVED THE SHRUBBERY
QUIVERS WHICH
RESEMBLED THE DEPARTURE OF SOULS RAN THROUGH THE GRASS
IN THE DISTANCE THE COMING AND GOING OF PATROLS AND THE GENERAL ROUNDS
OF THE ENGLISH CAMP WERE AUDIBLE
HOUGOMONT AND LA HAIE SAINTE CONTINUED TO BURN FORMING ONE IN THE
WEST THE OTHER IN THE EAST TWO GREAT FLAMES WHICH WERE JOINED BY THE
CORDON OF BIVOUAC FIRES OF THE ENGLISH LIKE A NECKLACE OF RUBIES
WITH TWO CARBUNCLES AT THE EXTREMITIES AS THEY EXTENDED IN AN IMMENSE
SEMICIRCLE OVER THE HILLS ALONG THE HORIZON
WE HAVE DESCRIBED THE CATASTROPHE OF THE ROAD OF OHAIN
THE HEART IS
TERRIFIED AT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT THAT DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN TO SO MANY
BRAVE MEN
IF THERE IS ANYTHING TERRIBLE IF THERE EXISTS A REALITY WHICH SURPASSES
DREAMS IT IS THIS TO LIVE TO SEE THE SUN TO BE IN FULL POSSESSION
OF VIRILE FORCE TO POSSESS HEALTH AND JOY TO LAUGH VALIANTLY TO RUSH
TOWARDS A GLORY WHICH ONE SEES DAZZLING IN FRONT OF ONE TO FEEL IN
ONE'S BREAST LUNGS WHICH BREATHE A HEART WHICH BEATS A WILL WHICH
REASONS TO SPEAK THINK HOPE LOVE TO HAVE A MOTHER TO HAVE A WIFE
TO HAVE CHILDREN TO HAVE THE LIGHT AND ALL AT ONCE IN THE SPACE OF A
SHOUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE TO SINK INTO AN ABYSS TO FALL TO
ROLL TO CRUSH TO BE CRUSHED TO SEE EARS OF WHEAT FLOWERS LEAVES
BRANCHES NOT TO BE ABLE TO CATCH HOLD OF ANYTHING TO FEEL ONE'S SWORD
USELESS MEN BENEATH ONE HORSES ON TOP OF ONE TO STRUGGLE IN VAIN
SINCE ONE'S BONES HAVE BEEN BROKEN BY SOME KICK IN THE DARKNESS TO FEEL
A HEEL WHICH MAKES ONE'S EYES START FROM THEIR SOCKETS TO BITE HORSES'
SHOES IN ONE'S RAGE TO STIFLE TO YELL TO WRITHE TO BE BENEATH AND
TO SAY TO ONE'S SELF BUT JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO I WAS A LIVING MAN
THERE WHERE THAT LAMENTABLE DISASTER HAD UTTERED ITS DEATH RATTLE
ALL WAS SILENCE NOW
THE EDGES OF THE HOLLOW ROAD WERE ENCUMBERED WITH
HORSES AND RIDERS INEXTRICABLY HEAPED UP
TERRIBLE ENTANGLEMENT THERE
WAS NO LONGER ANY SLOPE FOR THE CORPSES HAD LEVELLED THE ROAD WITH THE
PLAIN AND REACHED THE BRIM LIKE A WELL FILLED BUSHEL OF BARLEY
A
HEAP OF DEAD BODIES IN THE UPPER PART A RIVER OF BLOOD IN THE LOWER
PART SUCH WAS THAT ROAD ON THE EVENING OF THE 18TH OF JUNE 1815
THE
BLOOD RAN EVEN TO THE NIVELLES HIGHWAY AND THERE OVERFLOWED IN A LARGE
POOL IN FRONT OF THE ABATIS OF TREES WHICH BARRED THE WAY AT A SPOT
WHICH IS STILL POINTED OUT
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS AT THE OPPOSITE POINT IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE GENAPPE ROAD THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CUIRASSIERS
HAD TAKEN PLACE
THE THICKNESS OF THE LAYER OF BODIES WAS PROPORTIONED
TO THE DEPTH OF THE HOLLOW ROAD
TOWARDS THE MIDDLE AT THE POINT
WHERE IT BECAME LEVEL WHERE DELORT'S DIVISION HAD PASSED THE LAYER OF
CORPSES WAS THINNER
THE NOCTURNAL PROWLER WHOM WE HAVE JUST SHOWN TO THE READER WAS GOING
IN THAT DIRECTION
HE WAS SEARCHING THAT VAST TOMB
HE GAZED ABOUT
HE
PASSED THE DEAD IN SOME SORT OF HIDEOUS REVIEW
HE WALKED WITH HIS FEET
IN THE BLOOD
ALL AT ONCE HE PAUSED
A FEW PACES IN FRONT OF HIM IN THE HOLLOW ROAD AT THE POINT WHERE
THE PILE OF DEAD CAME TO AN END AN OPEN HAND ILLUMINED BY THE MOON
PROJECTED FROM BENEATH THAT HEAP OF MEN
THAT HAND HAD ON ITS FINGER
SOMETHING SPARKLING WHICH WAS A RING OF GOLD
THE MAN BENT OVER REMAINED IN A CROUCHING ATTITUDE FOR A MOMENT AND
WHEN HE ROSE THERE WAS NO LONGER A RING ON THE HAND
HE DID NOT PRECISELY RISE HE REMAINED IN A STOOPING AND FRIGHTENED
ATTITUDE WITH HIS BACK TURNED TO THE HEAP OF DEAD SCANNING THE HORIZON
ON HIS KNEES WITH THE WHOLE UPPER PORTION OF HIS BODY SUPPORTED ON HIS
TWO FOREFINGERS WHICH RESTED ON THE EARTH AND HIS HEAD PEERING ABOVE
THE EDGE OF THE HOLLOW ROAD
THE JACKAL'S FOUR PAWS SUIT SOME ACTIONS
THEN COMING TO A DECISION HE ROSE TO HIS FEET
AT THAT MOMENT HE GAVE A TERRIBLE START
HE FELT SOME ONE CLUTCH HIM
FROM BEHIND
HE WHEELED ROUND IT WAS THE OPEN HAND WHICH HAD CLOSED AND HAD SEIZED
THE SKIRT OF HIS COAT
AN HONEST MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIFIED THIS MAN BURST INTO A LAUGH
COME SAID HE IT'S ONLY A DEAD BODY
I PREFER A SPOOK TO A
GENDARME
BUT THE HAND WEAKENED AND RELEASED HIM
EFFORT IS QUICKLY EXHAUSTED IN
THE GRAVE
WELL NOW SAID THE PROWLER IS THAT DEAD FELLOW ALIVE LET'S SEE
HE BENT DOWN AGAIN FUMBLED AMONG THE HEAP PUSHED ASIDE EVERYTHING THAT
WAS IN HIS WAY SEIZED THE HAND GRASPED THE ARM FREED THE HEAD PULLED
OUT THE BODY AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE WAS DRAGGING THE LIFELESS OR
AT LEAST THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN THROUGH THE SHADOWS OF HOLLOW ROAD
HE
WAS A CUIRASSIER AN OFFICER AND EVEN AN OFFICER OF CONSIDERABLE RANK
A LARGE GOLD EPAULETTE PEEPED FROM BENEATH THE CUIRASS THIS OFFICER
NO LONGER POSSESSED A HELMET
A FURIOUS SWORD CUT HAD SCARRED HIS FACE
WHERE NOTHING WAS DISCERNIBLE BUT BLOOD
HOWEVER HE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY BROKEN LIMBS AND BY SOME HAPPY
CHANCE IF THAT WORD IS PERMISSIBLE HERE THE DEAD HAD BEEN VAULTED
ABOVE HIM IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PRESERVE HIM FROM BEING CRUSHED
HIS
EYES WERE STILL CLOSED
ON HIS CUIRASS HE WORE THE SILVER CROSS OF THE LEGION OF HONOR
THE PROWLER TORE OFF THIS CROSS WHICH DISAPPEARED INTO ONE OF THE GULFS
WHICH HE HAD BENEATH HIS GREAT COAT
THEN HE FELT OF THE OFFICER'S FOB DISCOVERED A WATCH THERE AND TOOK
POSSESSION OF IT
NEXT HE SEARCHED HIS WAISTCOAT FOUND A PURSE AND
POCKETED IT
WHEN HE HAD ARRIVED AT THIS STAGE OF SUCCOR WHICH HE WAS ADMINISTERING
TO THIS DYING MAN THE OFFICER OPENED HIS EYES
THANKS HE SAID FEEBLY
THE ABRUPTNESS OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MAN WHO WAS MANIPULATING HIM THE
FRESHNESS OF THE NIGHT THE AIR WHICH HE COULD INHALE FREELY HAD ROUSED
HIM FROM HIS LETHARGY
THE PROWLER MADE NO REPLY
HE RAISED HIS HEAD
A SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS WAS
AUDIBLE IN THE PLAIN SOME PATROL WAS PROBABLY APPROACHING
THE OFFICER MURMURED FOR THE DEATH AGONY WAS STILL IN HIS VOICE
WHO WON THE BATTLE
THE ENGLISH ANSWERED THE PROWLER
THE OFFICER WENT ON
LOOK IN MY POCKETS YOU WILL FIND A WATCH AND A PURSE
TAKE THEM
IT WAS ALREADY DONE
THE PROWLER EXECUTED THE REQUIRED FEINT AND SAID
THERE IS NOTHING THERE
I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SAID THE OFFICER I AM SORRY FOR THAT
YOU SHOULD
HAVE HAD THEM
THE STEPS OF THE PATROL BECAME MORE AND MORE DISTINCT
SOME ONE IS COMING SAID THE PROWLER WITH THE MOVEMENT OF A MAN WHO
IS TAKING HIS DEPARTURE
THE OFFICER RAISED HIS ARM FEEBLY AND DETAINED HIM
YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE
WHO ARE YOU
THE PROWLER ANSWERED RAPIDLY AND IN A LOW VOICE
LIKE YOURSELF I BELONGED TO THE FRENCH ARMY
I MUST LEAVE YOU
IF THEY
WERE TO CATCH ME THEY WOULD SHOOT ME
I HAVE SAVED YOUR LIFE
NOW GET
OUT OF THE SCRAPE YOURSELF
WHAT IS YOUR RANK
SERGEANT
WHAT IS YOUR NAME
THENARDIER
I SHALL NOT FORGET THAT NAME SAID THE OFFICER AND DO YOU REMEMBER
MINE
MY NAME IS PONTMERCY
BOOK SECOND THE SHIP ORION
CHAPTER I NUMBER 24 601 BECOMES NUMBER 9 430
JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN RECAPTURED
THE READER WILL BE GRATEFUL TO US IF WE PASS RAPIDLY OVER THE SAD
DETAILS
WE WILL CONFINE OURSELVES TO TRANSCRIBING TWO PARAGRAPHS
PUBLISHED BY THE JOURNALS OF THAT DAY A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE SURPRISING
EVENTS WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE AT M
SUR M
THESE ARTICLES ARE RATHER SUMMARY
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THAT
EPOCH THE GAZETTE DES TRIBUNAUX WAS NOT YET IN EXISTENCE
WE BORROW THE FIRST FROM THE DRAPEAU BLANC
IT BEARS THE DATE OF JULY
25 1823
AN ARRONDISSEMENT OF THE PAS DE CALAIS HAS JUST BEEN THE THEATRE OF AN
EVENT QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY COURSE
A MAN WHO WAS A STRANGER IN THE
DEPARTMENT AND WHO BORE THE NAME OF M
MADELEINE HAD THANKS TO THE
NEW METHODS RESUSCITATED SOME YEARS AGO AN ANCIENT LOCAL INDUSTRY THE
MANUFACTURE OF JET AND OF BLACK GLASS TRINKETS
HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE
IN THE BUSINESS AND THAT OF THE ARRONDISSEMENT AS WELL WE WILL ADMIT
HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED MAYOR IN RECOGNITION OF HIS SERVICES
THE POLICE
DISCOVERED THAT M
MADELEINE WAS NO OTHER THAN AN EX CONVICT WHO HAD
BROKEN HIS BAN CONDEMNED IN 1796 FOR THEFT AND NAMED JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN HAS BEEN RECOMMITTED TO PRISON
IT APPEARS THAT PREVIOUS
TO HIS ARREST HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN WITHDRAWING FROM THE HANDS OF M
LAFFITTE A SUM OF OVER HALF A MILLION WHICH HE HAD LODGED THERE AND
WHICH HE HAD MOREOVER AND BY PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE MEANS ACQUIRED IN
HIS BUSINESS
NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER WHERE JEAN VALJEAN HAS
CONCEALED THIS MONEY SINCE HIS RETURN TO PRISON AT TOULON
THE SECOND ARTICLE WHICH ENTERS A LITTLE MORE INTO DETAIL IS AN
EXTRACT FROM THE JOURNAL DE PARIS OF THE SAME DATE
A FORMER CONVICT WHO HAD BEEN LIBERATED NAMED JEAN VALJEAN HAS JUST
APPEARED BEFORE THE COURT OF ASSIZES OF THE VAR UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES
CALCULATED TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
THIS WRETCH HAD SUCCEEDED IN ESCAPING
THE VIGILANCE OF THE POLICE HE HAD CHANGED HIS NAME AND HAD SUCCEEDED
IN GETTING HIMSELF APPOINTED MAYOR OF ONE OF OUR SMALL NORTHERN TOWNS
IN THIS TOWN HE HAD ESTABLISHED A CONSIDERABLE COMMERCE
HE HAS AT LAST
BEEN UNMASKED AND ARRESTED THANKS TO THE INDEFATIGABLE ZEAL OF THE
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR
HE HAD FOR HIS CONCUBINE A WOMAN OF THE TOWN WHO
DIED OF A SHOCK AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST
THIS SCOUNDREL WHO IS
ENDOWED WITH HERCULEAN STRENGTH FOUND MEANS TO ESCAPE BUT THREE OR
FOUR DAYS AFTER HIS FLIGHT THE POLICE LAID THEIR HANDS ON HIM ONCE MORE
IN PARIS ITSELF AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN HE WAS ENTERING ONE OF THOSE
LITTLE VEHICLES WHICH RUN BETWEEN THE CAPITAL AND THE VILLAGE OF
MONTFERMEIL SEINE ET OISE
HE IS SAID TO HAVE PROFITED BY THIS
INTERVAL OF THREE OR FOUR DAYS OF LIBERTY TO WITHDRAW A CONSIDERABLE
SUM DEPOSITED BY HIM WITH ONE OF OUR LEADING BANKERS
THIS SUM HAS BEEN
ESTIMATED AT SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
IF THE INDICTMENT IS
TO BE TRUSTED HE HAS HIDDEN IT IN SOME PLACE KNOWN TO HIMSELF ALONE
AND IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO LAY HANDS ON IT
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE
THE SAID JEAN VALJEAN HAS JUST BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE ASSIZES OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF THE VAR AS ACCUSED OF HIGHWAY ROBBERY ACCOMPANIED WITH
VIOLENCE ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO ON THE PERSON OF ONE OF THOSE HONEST
CHILDREN WHO AS THE PATRIARCH OF FERNEY HAS SAID IN IMMORTAL VERSE
ARRIVE FROM SAVOY EVERY YEAR
AND WHO WITH GENTLE HANDS DO CLEAR
THOSE LONG CANALS CHOKED UP WITH SOOT
THIS BANDIT REFUSED TO DEFEND HIMSELF
IT WAS PROVED BY THE SKILFUL AND
ELOQUENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THAT THE THEFT WAS
COMMITTED IN COMPLICITY WITH OTHERS AND THAT JEAN VALJEAN WAS A MEMBER
OF A BAND OF ROBBERS IN THE SOUTH
JEAN VALJEAN WAS PRONOUNCED GUILTY
AND WAS CONDEMNED TO THE DEATH PENALTY IN CONSEQUENCE
THIS CRIMINAL
REFUSED TO LODGE AN APPEAL
THE KING IN HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE CLEMENCY HAS
DEIGNED TO COMMUTE HIS PENALTY TO THAT OF PENAL SERVITUDE FOR LIFE
JEAN
VALJEAN WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN TO THE PRISON AT TOULON
THE READER HAS NOT FORGOTTEN THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD RELIGIOUS HABITS AT
M
SUR M
SOME PAPERS AMONG OTHERS THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESENTED THIS
COMMUTATION AS A TRIUMPH OF THE PRIESTLY PARTY
JEAN VALJEAN CHANGED HIS NUMBER IN THE GALLEYS
HE WAS CALLED 9 430
HOWEVER AND WE WILL MENTION IT AT ONCE IN ORDER THAT WE MAY NOT BE
OBLIGED TO RECUR TO THE SUBJECT THE PROSPERITY OF M
SUR M
VANISHED
WITH M
MADELEINE ALL THAT HE HAD FORESEEN DURING HIS NIGHT OF FEVER
AND HESITATION WAS REALIZED LACKING HIM THERE ACTUALLY WAS A SOUL
LACKING
AFTER THIS FALL THERE TOOK PLACE AT M
SUR M
THAT EGOTISTICAL
DIVISION OF GREAT EXISTENCES WHICH HAVE FALLEN THAT FATAL DISMEMBERMENT
OF FLOURISHING THINGS WHICH IS ACCOMPLISHED EVERY DAY OBSCURELY IN
THE HUMAN COMMUNITY AND WHICH HISTORY HAS NOTED ONLY ONCE BECAUSE IT
OCCURRED AFTER THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER
LIEUTENANTS ARE CROWNED KINGS
SUPERINTENDENTS IMPROVISE MANUFACTURERS OUT OF THEMSELVES
ENVIOUS
RIVALRIES AROSE
M
MADELEINE'S VAST WORKSHOPS WERE SHUT HIS BUILDINGS
FELL TO RUIN HIS WORKMEN WERE SCATTERED
SOME OF THEM QUITTED THE
COUNTRY OTHERS ABANDONED THE TRADE
THENCEFORTH EVERYTHING WAS DONE
ON A SMALL SCALE INSTEAD OF ON A GRAND SCALE FOR LUCRE INSTEAD OF
THE GENERAL GOOD
THERE WAS NO LONGER A CENTRE EVERYWHERE THERE
WAS COMPETITION AND ANIMOSITY
M
MADELEINE HAD REIGNED OVER ALL AND
DIRECTED ALL
NO SOONER HAD HE FALLEN THAN EACH PULLED THINGS TO
HIMSELF THE SPIRIT OF COMBAT SUCCEEDED TO THE SPIRIT OF ORGANIZATION
BITTERNESS TO CORDIALITY HATRED OF ONE ANOTHER TO THE BENEVOLENCE OF
THE FOUNDER TOWARDS ALL THE THREADS WHICH M
MADELEINE HAD SET WERE
TANGLED AND BROKEN THE METHODS WERE ADULTERATED THE PRODUCTS WERE
DEBASED CONFIDENCE WAS KILLED THE MARKET DIMINISHED FOR LACK OF
ORDERS SALARIES WERE REDUCED THE WORKSHOPS STOOD STILL BANKRUPTCY
ARRIVED
AND THEN THERE WAS NOTHING MORE FOR THE POOR
ALL HAD VANISHED
THE STATE ITSELF PERCEIVED THAT SOME ONE HAD BEEN CRUSHED SOMEWHERE
LESS THAN FOUR YEARS AFTER THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF ASSIZES
ESTABLISHING THE IDENTITY OF JEAN VALJEAN AND M
MADELEINE FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THE GALLEYS THE COST OF COLLECTING TAXES HAD DOUBLED IN THE
ARRONDISSEMENT OF M
SUR M AND M
DE VILLELE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE
FACT IN THE ROSTRUM IN THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1827
CHAPTER II IN WHICH THE READER WILL PERUSE TWO VERSES WHICH ARE OF THE
DEVIL'S COMPOSITION POSSIBLY
BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER IT WILL BE TO THE PURPOSE TO NARRATE IN SOME
DETAIL A SINGULAR OCCURRENCE WHICH TOOK PLACE AT ABOUT THE SAME EPOCH
IN MONTFERMEIL AND WHICH IS NOT LACKING IN COINCIDENCE WITH CERTAIN
CONJECTURES OF THE INDICTMENT
THERE EXISTS IN THE REGION OF MONTFERMEIL A VERY ANCIENT SUPERSTITION
WHICH IS ALL THE MORE CURIOUS AND ALL THE MORE PRECIOUS BECAUSE
A POPULAR SUPERSTITION IN THE VICINITY OF PARIS IS LIKE AN ALOE IN
SIBERIA
WE ARE AMONG THOSE WHO RESPECT EVERYTHING WHICH IS IN THE
NATURE OF A RARE PLANT
HERE THEN IS THE SUPERSTITION OF MONTFERMEIL
IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE DEVIL FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAS SELECTED THE
FOREST AS A HIDING PLACE FOR HIS TREASURES
GOODWIVES AFFIRM THAT IT IS
NO RARITY TO ENCOUNTER AT NIGHTFALL IN SECLUDED NOOKS OF THE FOREST
A BLACK MAN WITH THE AIR OF A CARTER OR A WOOD CHOPPER WEARING WOODEN
SHOES CLAD IN TROUSERS AND A BLOUSE OF LINEN AND RECOGNIZABLE BY THE
FACT THAT INSTEAD OF A CAP OR HAT HE HAS TWO IMMENSE HORNS ON HIS
HEAD
THIS OUGHT IN FACT TO RENDER HIM RECOGNIZABLE
THIS MAN IS
HABITUALLY ENGAGED IN DIGGING A HOLE
THERE ARE THREE WAYS OF PROFITING
BY SUCH AN ENCOUNTER
THE FIRST IS TO APPROACH THE MAN AND SPEAK TO HIM
THEN IT IS SEEN THAT THE MAN IS SIMPLY A PEASANT THAT HE APPEARS BLACK
BECAUSE IT IS NIGHTFALL THAT HE IS NOT DIGGING ANY HOLE WHATEVER BUT
IS CUTTING GRASS FOR HIS COWS AND THAT WHAT HAD BEEN TAKEN FOR HORNS
IS NOTHING BUT A DUNG FORK WHICH HE IS CARRYING ON HIS BACK AND WHOSE
TEETH THANKS TO THE PERSPECTIVE OF EVENING SEEMED TO SPRING FROM HIS
HEAD
THE MAN RETURNS HOME AND DIES WITHIN THE WEEK
THE SECOND WAY IS
TO WATCH HIM TO WAIT UNTIL HE HAS DUG HIS HOLE UNTIL HE HAS FILLED IT
AND HAS GONE AWAY THEN TO RUN WITH GREAT SPEED TO THE TRENCH TO
OPEN IT ONCE MORE AND TO SEIZE THE TREASURE WHICH THE BLACK MAN
HAS NECESSARILY PLACED THERE
IN THIS CASE ONE DIES WITHIN THE MONTH
FINALLY THE LAST METHOD IS NOT TO SPEAK TO THE BLACK MAN NOT TO LOOK
AT HIM AND TO FLEE AT THE BEST SPEED OF ONE'S LEGS
ONE THEN DIES
WITHIN THE YEAR
AS ALL THREE METHODS ARE ATTENDED WITH THEIR SPECIAL INCONVENIENCES THE
SECOND WHICH AT ALL EVENTS PRESENTS SOME ADVANTAGES AMONG OTHERS THAT
OF POSSESSING A TREASURE IF ONLY FOR A MONTH IS THE ONE MOST GENERALLY
ADOPTED
SO BOLD MEN WHO ARE TEMPTED BY EVERY CHANCE HAVE QUITE
FREQUENTLY AS WE ARE ASSURED OPENED THE HOLES EXCAVATED BY THE BLACK
MAN AND TRIED TO ROB THE DEVIL
THE SUCCESS OF THE OPERATION APPEARS
TO BE BUT MODERATE
AT LEAST IF THE TRADITION IS TO BE BELIEVED AND IN
PARTICULAR THE TWO ENIGMATICAL LINES IN BARBAROUS LATIN WHICH AN
EVIL NORMAN MONK A BIT OF A SORCERER NAMED TRYPHON HAS LEFT ON
THIS SUBJECT
THIS TRYPHON IS BURIED AT THE ABBEY OF SAINT GEORGES DE
BOCHERVILLE NEAR ROUEN AND TOADS SPAWN ON HIS GRAVE
ACCORDINGLY ENORMOUS EFFORTS ARE MADE
SUCH TRENCHES ARE ORDINARILY
EXTREMELY DEEP A MAN SWEATS DIGS TOILS ALL NIGHT FOR IT MUST BE DONE
AT NIGHT HE WETS HIS SHIRT BURNS OUT HIS CANDLE BREAKS HIS MATTOCK
AND WHEN HE ARRIVES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE WHEN HE LAYS HIS HAND ON
THE TREASURE WHAT DOES HE FIND WHAT IS THE DEVIL'S TREASURE A SOU
SOMETIMES A CROWN PIECE A STONE A SKELETON A BLEEDING BODY SOMETIMES
A SPECTRE FOLDED IN FOUR LIKE A SHEET OF PAPER IN A PORTFOLIO
SOMETIMES NOTHING
THIS IS WHAT TRYPHON'S VERSES SEEM TO ANNOUNCE TO THE
INDISCREET AND CURIOUS
FODIT ET IN FOSSA THESAUROS CONDIT OPACA
AS NUMMAS LAPIDES CADAVER SIMULACRA NIHILQUE
IT SEEMS THAT IN OUR DAY THERE IS SOMETIMES FOUND A POWDER HORN WITH
BULLETS SOMETIMES AN OLD PACK OF CARDS GREASY AND WORN WHICH HAS
EVIDENTLY SERVED THE DEVIL
TRYPHON DOES NOT RECORD THESE TWO FINDS
SINCE TRYPHON LIVED IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY AND SINCE THE DEVIL DOES NOT
APPEAR TO HAVE HAD THE WIT TO INVENT POWDER BEFORE ROGER BACON'S TIME
AND CARDS BEFORE THE TIME OF CHARLES VI
MOREOVER IF ONE PLAYS AT CARDS ONE IS SURE TO LOSE ALL THAT ONE
POSSESSES AND AS FOR THE POWDER IN THE HORN IT POSSESSES THE PROPERTY
OF MAKING YOUR GUN BURST IN YOUR FACE
NOW A VERY SHORT TIME AFTER THE EPOCH WHEN IT SEEMED TO THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY THAT THE LIBERATED CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN DURING HIS FLIGHT OF
SEVERAL DAYS HAD BEEN PROWLING AROUND MONTFERMEIL IT WAS REMARKED IN
THAT VILLAGE THAT A CERTAIN OLD ROAD LABORER NAMED BOULATRUELLE HAD
PECULIAR WAYS IN THE FOREST
PEOPLE THEREABOUTS THOUGHT THEY KNEW THAT
THIS BOULATRUELLE HAD BEEN IN THE GALLEYS
HE WAS SUBJECTED TO
CERTAIN POLICE SUPERVISION AND AS HE COULD FIND WORK NOWHERE THE
ADMINISTRATION EMPLOYED HIM AT REDUCED RATES AS A ROAD MENDER ON THE
CROSS ROAD FROM GAGNY TO LAGNY
THIS BOULATRUELLE WAS A MAN WHO WAS VIEWED WITH DISFAVOR BY THE
INHABITANTS OF THE DISTRICT AS TOO RESPECTFUL TOO HUMBLE TOO PROMPT IN
REMOVING HIS CAP TO EVERY ONE AND TREMBLING AND SMILING IN THE PRESENCE
OF THE GENDARMES PROBABLY AFFILIATED TO ROBBER BANDS THEY SAID
SUSPECTED OF LYING IN AMBUSH AT VERGE OF COPSES AT NIGHTFALL
THE ONLY
THING IN HIS FAVOR WAS THAT HE WAS A DRUNKARD
THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY HAD NOTICED
OF LATE BOULATRUELLE HAD TAKEN TO QUITTING HIS TASK OF STONE BREAKING
AND CARE OF THE ROAD AT A VERY EARLY HOUR AND TO BETAKING HIMSELF TO
THE FOREST WITH HIS PICKAXE
HE WAS ENCOUNTERED TOWARDS EVENING IN
THE MOST DESERTED CLEARINGS IN THE WILDEST THICKETS AND HE HAD THE
APPEARANCE OF BEING IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING AND SOMETIMES HE WAS DIGGING
HOLES
THE GOODWIVES WHO PASSED TOOK HIM AT FIRST FOR BEELZEBUB THEN
THEY RECOGNIZED BOULATRUELLE AND WERE NOT IN THE LEAST REASSURED
THEREBY
THESE ENCOUNTERS SEEMED TO CAUSE BOULATRUELLE A LIVELY
DISPLEASURE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE SOUGHT TO HIDE AND THAT THERE WAS
SOME MYSTERY IN WHAT HE WAS DOING
IT WAS SAID IN THE VILLAGE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE DEVIL HAS APPEARED
BOULATRUELLE HAS SEEN HIM AND IS ON THE SEARCH
IN SOOTH HE IS CUNNING
ENOUGH TO POCKET LUCIFER'S HOARD
THE VOLTAIRIANS ADDED WILL BOULATRUELLE CATCH THE DEVIL OR WILL THE
DEVIL CATCH BOULATRUELLE THE OLD WOMEN MADE A GREAT MANY SIGNS OF THE
CROSS
IN THE MEANTIME BOULATRUELLE'S MANOEUVRES IN THE FOREST CEASED AND HE
RESUMED HIS REGULAR OCCUPATION OF ROADMENDING AND PEOPLE GOSSIPED OF
SOMETHING ELSE
SOME PERSONS HOWEVER WERE STILL CURIOUS SURMISING THAT IN ALL THIS
THERE WAS PROBABLY NO FABULOUS TREASURE OF THE LEGENDS BUT SOME
FINE WINDFALL OF A MORE SERIOUS AND PALPABLE SORT THAN THE DEVIL'S
BANK BILLS AND THAT THE ROAD MENDER HAD HALF DISCOVERED THE SECRET
THE
MOST PUZZLED WERE THE SCHOOL MASTER AND THENARDIER THE PROPRIETOR OF
THE TAVERN WHO WAS EVERYBODY'S FRIEND AND HAD NOT DISDAINED TO ALLY
HIMSELF WITH BOULATRUELLE
HE HAS BEEN IN THE GALLEYS SAID THENARDIER
EH GOOD GOD NO ONE
KNOWS WHO HAS BEEN THERE OR WILL BE THERE
ONE EVENING THE SCHOOLMASTER AFFIRMED THAT IN FORMER TIMES THE LAW WOULD
HAVE INSTITUTED AN INQUIRY AS TO WHAT BOULATRUELLE DID IN THE FOREST
AND THAT THE LATTER WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SPEAK AND THAT HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN PUT TO THE TORTURE IN CASE OF NEED AND THAT BOULATRUELLE
WOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED THE WATER TEST FOR EXAMPLE
LET US PUT HIM TO
THE WINE TEST SAID THENARDIER
THEY MADE AN EFFORT AND GOT THE OLD ROAD MENDER TO DRINKING
BOULATRUELLE DRANK AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT BUT SAID VERY LITTLE
HE COMBINED
WITH ADMIRABLE ART AND IN MASTERLY PROPORTIONS THE THIRST OF A
GORMANDIZER WITH THE DISCRETION OF A JUDGE
NEVERTHELESS BY DINT OF
RETURNING TO THE CHARGE AND OF COMPARING AND PUTTING TOGETHER THE FEW
OBSCURE WORDS WHICH HE DID ALLOW TO ESCAPE HIM THIS IS WHAT THENARDIER
AND THE SCHOOLMASTER IMAGINED THAT THEY HAD MADE OUT
ONE MORNING WHEN BOULATRUELLE WAS ON HIS WAY TO HIS WORK AT DAYBREAK
HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO SEE AT A NOOK OF THE FOREST IN THE UNDERBRUSH
A SHOVEL AND A PICKAXE CONCEALED AS ONE MIGHT SAY
HOWEVER HE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY THE SHOVEL AND
PICK OF FATHER SIX FOURS THE WATER CARRIER AND WOULD HAVE THOUGHT NO
MORE ABOUT IT
BUT ON THE EVENING OF THAT DAY HE SAW WITHOUT BEING
SEEN HIMSELF AS HE WAS HIDDEN BY A LARGE TREE A PERSON WHO DID NOT
BELONG IN THOSE PARTS AND WHOM HE BOULATRUELLE KNEW WELL DIRECTING
HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE DENSEST PART OF THE WOOD
TRANSLATION BY
THENARDIER A COMRADE OF THE GALLEYS
BOULATRUELLE OBSTINATELY REFUSED
TO REVEAL HIS NAME
THIS PERSON CARRIED A PACKAGE SOMETHING SQUARE
LIKE A LARGE BOX OR A SMALL TRUNK
SURPRISE ON THE PART OF BOULATRUELLE
HOWEVER IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES THAT
THE IDEA OF FOLLOWING THAT PERSON HAD OCCURRED TO HIM
BUT IT WAS TOO
LATE THE PERSON WAS ALREADY IN THE THICKET NIGHT HAD DESCENDED AND
BOULATRUELLE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CATCH UP WITH HIM
THEN HE HAD
ADOPTED THE COURSE OF WATCHING FOR HIM AT THE EDGE OF THE WOODS
IT WAS
MOONLIGHT TWO OR THREE HOURS LATER BOULATRUELLE HAD SEEN THIS PERSON
EMERGE FROM THE BRUSHWOOD CARRYING NO LONGER THE COFFER BUT A SHOVEL
AND PICK
BOULATRUELLE HAD ALLOWED THE PERSON TO PASS AND HAD NOT
DREAMED OF ACCOSTING HIM BECAUSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THE OTHER MAN
WAS THREE TIMES AS STRONG AS HE WAS AND ARMED WITH A PICKAXE AND THAT
HE WOULD PROBABLY KNOCK HIM OVER THE HEAD ON RECOGNIZING HIM AND ON
PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS RECOGNIZED
TOUCHING EFFUSION OF TWO OLD COMRADES
ON MEETING AGAIN
BUT THE SHOVEL AND PICK HAD SERVED AS A RAY OF LIGHT
TO BOULATRUELLE HE HAD HASTENED TO THE THICKET IN THE MORNING AND HAD
FOUND NEITHER SHOVEL NOR PICK
FROM THIS HE HAD DRAWN THE INFERENCE THAT
THIS PERSON ONCE IN THE FOREST HAD DUG A HOLE WITH HIS PICK BURIED
THE COFFER AND RECLOSED THE HOLE WITH HIS SHOVEL
NOW THE COFFER WAS
TOO SMALL TO CONTAIN A BODY THEREFORE IT CONTAINED MONEY
HENCE HIS
RESEARCHES
BOULATRUELLE HAD EXPLORED SOUNDED SEARCHED THE ENTIRE
FOREST AND THE THICKET AND HAD DUG WHEREVER THE EARTH APPEARED TO HIM
TO HAVE BEEN RECENTLY TURNED UP
IN VAIN
HE HAD FERRETED OUT NOTHING
NO ONE IN MONTFERMEIL THOUGHT ANY MORE
ABOUT IT
THERE WERE ONLY A FEW BRAVE GOSSIPS WHO SAID YOU MAY BE
CERTAIN THAT THE MENDER ON THE GAGNY ROAD DID NOT TAKE ALL THAT TROUBLE
FOR NOTHING HE WAS SURE THAT THE DEVIL HAD COME
CHAPTER III THE ANKLE CHAIN MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CERTAIN PREPARATORY
MANIPULATION TO BE THUS BROKEN WITH A BLOW FROM A HAMMER
TOWARDS THE END OF OCTOBER IN THAT SAME YEAR 1823 THE INHABITANTS OF
TOULON BEHELD THE ENTRY INTO THEIR PORT AFTER HEAVY WEATHER AND FOR
THE PURPOSE OF REPAIRING SOME DAMAGES OF THE SHIP ORION WHICH WAS
EMPLOYED LATER AT BREST AS A SCHOOL SHIP AND WHICH THEN FORMED A PART
OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SQUADRON
THIS VESSEL BATTERED AS IT WAS FOR THE SEA HAD HANDLED IT
ROUGHLY PRODUCED A FINE EFFECT AS IT ENTERED THE ROADS
IT FLEW SOME
COLORS WHICH PROCURED FOR IT THE REGULATION SALUTE OF ELEVEN GUNS WHICH
IT RETURNED SHOT FOR SHOT TOTAL TWENTY TWO
IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED
THAT WHAT WITH SALVOS ROYAL AND MILITARY POLITENESSES COURTEOUS
EXCHANGES OF UPROAR SIGNALS OF ETIQUETTE FORMALITIES OF ROADSTEADS AND
CITADELS SUNRISES AND SUNSETS SALUTED EVERY DAY BY ALL FORTRESSES AND
ALL SHIPS OF WAR OPENINGS AND CLOSINGS OF PORTS ETC THE CIVILIZED

HOURS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND USELESS SHOTS

SHOT THAT COMES TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A DAY THREE HUNDRED
MILLIONS A YEAR WHICH VANISH IN SMOKE
THIS IS A MERE DETAIL
ALL THIS
TIME THE POOR WERE DYING OF HUNGER
THE YEAR 1823 WAS WHAT THE RESTORATION CALLED THE EPOCH OF THE SPANISH
WAR
THIS WAR CONTAINED MANY EVENTS IN ONE AND A QUANTITY OF PECULIARITIES
A GRAND FAMILY AFFAIR FOR THE HOUSE OF BOURBON THE BRANCH OF FRANCE
SUCCORING AND PROTECTING THE BRANCH OF MADRID THAT IS TO SAY
PERFORMING AN ACT DEVOLVING ON THE ELDER AN APPARENT RETURN TO OUR

EMPIRE SETTING OUT ON A FRESH CAMPAIGN BUT AGED SADDENED AFTER EIGHT
YEARS OF REPOSE AND UNDER THE WHITE COCKADE THE TRICOLORED STANDARD
WAVED ABROAD BY A HEROIC HANDFUL OF FRENCHMEN AS THE WHITE STANDARD HAD
BEEN THIRTY YEARS EARLIER AT COBLENTZ MONKS MINGLED WITH OUR TROOPS
THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY AND OF NOVELTY BROUGHT TO ITS SENSES BY BAYONETS
PRINCIPLES SLAUGHTERED BY CANNONADES FRANCE UNDOING BY HER ARMS THAT
WHICH SHE HAD DONE BY HER MIND IN ADDITION TO THIS HOSTILE LEADERS
SOLD SOLDIERS HESITATING CITIES BESIEGED BY MILLIONS NO MILITARY
PERILS AND YET POSSIBLE EXPLOSIONS AS IN EVERY MINE WHICH IS SURPRISED
AND INVADED BUT LITTLE BLOODSHED LITTLE HONOR WON SHAME FOR SOME
GLORY FOR NO ONE
SUCH WAS THIS WAR MADE BY THE PRINCES DESCENDED FROM
LOUIS XIV AND CONDUCTED BY GENERALS WHO HAD BEEN UNDER NAPOLEON
ITS
SAD FATE WAS TO RECALL NEITHER THE GRAND WAR NOR GRAND POLITICS
SOME FEATS OF ARMS WERE SERIOUS THE TAKING OF THE TROCADERO AMONG
OTHERS WAS A FINE MILITARY ACTION BUT AFTER ALL WE REPEAT THE
TRUMPETS OF THIS WAR GIVE BACK A CRACKED SOUND THE WHOLE EFFECT WAS
SUSPICIOUS HISTORY APPROVES OF FRANCE FOR MAKING A DIFFICULTY ABOUT
ACCEPTING THIS FALSE TRIUMPH
IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT CERTAIN SPANISH
OFFICERS CHARGED WITH RESISTANCE YIELDED TOO EASILY THE IDEA OF
CORRUPTION WAS CONNECTED WITH THE VICTORY IT APPEARS AS THOUGH GENERALS
AND NOT BATTLES HAD BEEN WON AND THE CONQUERING SOLDIER RETURNED
HUMILIATED
A DEBASING WAR IN SHORT IN WHICH THE BANK OF FRANCE COULD
BE READ IN THE FOLDS OF THE FLAG
SOLDIERS OF THE WAR OF 1808 ON WHOM SARAGOSSA HAD FALLEN IN FORMIDABLE
RUIN FROWNED IN 1823 AT THE EASY SURRENDER OF CITADELS AND BEGAN TO
REGRET PALAFOX
IT IS THE NATURE OF FRANCE TO PREFER TO HAVE ROSTOPCHINE
RATHER THAN BALLESTEROS IN FRONT OF HER
FROM A STILL MORE SERIOUS POINT OF VIEW AND ONE WHICH IT IS ALSO PROPER
TO INSIST UPON HERE THIS WAR WHICH WOUNDED THE MILITARY SPIRIT
OF FRANCE ENRAGED THE DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT
IT WAS AN ENTERPRISE OF
INTHRALMENT
IN THAT CAMPAIGN THE OBJECT OF THE FRENCH SOLDIER THE
SON OF DEMOCRACY WAS THE CONQUEST OF A YOKE FOR OTHERS
A HIDEOUS
CONTRADICTION
FRANCE IS MADE TO AROUSE THE SOUL OF NATIONS NOT TO
STIFLE IT
ALL THE REVOLUTIONS OF EUROPE SINCE 1792 ARE THE FRENCH
REVOLUTION LIBERTY DARTS RAYS FROM FRANCE
THAT IS A SOLAR FACT
BLIND
IS HE WHO WILL NOT SEE IT WAS BONAPARTE WHO SAID IT
THE WAR OF 1823 AN OUTRAGE ON THE GENEROUS SPANISH NATION WAS THEN
AT THE SAME TIME AN OUTRAGE ON THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
IT WAS FRANCE
WHO COMMITTED THIS MONSTROUS VIOLENCE BY FOUL MEANS FOR WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF WARS OF LIBERATION EVERYTHING THAT ARMIES DO IS BY FOUL
MEANS
THE WORDS PASSIVE OBEDIENCE INDICATE THIS
AN ARMY IS A STRANGE
MASTERPIECE OF COMBINATION WHERE FORCE RESULTS FROM AN ENORMOUS SUM
OF IMPOTENCE
THUS IS WAR MADE BY HUMANITY AGAINST HUMANITY DESPITE
HUMANITY EXPLAINED
AS FOR THE BOURBONS THE WAR OF 1823 WAS FATAL TO THEM
THEY TOOK IT FOR
A SUCCESS
THEY DID NOT PERCEIVE THE DANGER THAT LIES IN HAVING AN IDEA
SLAIN TO ORDER
THEY WENT ASTRAY IN THEIR INNOCENCE TO SUCH A DEGREE
THAT THEY INTRODUCED THE IMMENSE ENFEEBLEMENT OF A CRIME INTO THEIR
ESTABLISHMENT AS AN ELEMENT OF STRENGTH
THE SPIRIT OF THE AMBUSH
ENTERED INTO THEIR POLITICS
1830 HAD ITS GERM IN 1823
THE SPANISH
CAMPAIGN BECAME IN THEIR COUNSELS AN ARGUMENT FOR FORCE AND FOR
ADVENTURES BY RIGHT DIVINE
FRANCE HAVING RE ESTABLISHED ELREY NETTO
IN SPAIN MIGHT WELL HAVE RE ESTABLISHED THE ABSOLUTE KING AT HOME
THEY
FELL INTO THE ALARMING ERROR OF TAKING THE OBEDIENCE OF THE SOLDIER FOR
THE CONSENT OF THE NATION
SUCH CONFIDENCE IS THE RUIN OF THRONES
IT IS
NOT PERMITTED TO FALL ASLEEP EITHER IN THE SHADOW OF A MACHINEEL TREE
NOR IN THE SHADOW OF AN ARMY
LET US RETURN TO THE SHIP ORION
DURING THE OPERATIONS OF THE ARMY COMMANDED BY THE PRINCE GENERALISSIMO
A SQUADRON HAD BEEN CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
WE HAVE JUST STATED
THAT THE ORION BELONGED TO THIS FLEET AND THAT ACCIDENTS OF THE SEA HAD
BROUGHT IT INTO PORT AT TOULON
THE PRESENCE OF A VESSEL OF WAR IN A PORT HAS SOMETHING ABOUT IT WHICH
ATTRACTS AND ENGAGES A CROWD
IT IS BECAUSE IT IS GREAT AND THE CROWD
LOVES WHAT IS GREAT
A SHIP OF THE LINE IS ONE OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT COMBINATIONS OF THE
GENIUS OF MAN WITH THE POWERS OF NATURE
A SHIP OF THE LINE IS COMPOSED AT THE SAME TIME OF THE HEAVIEST AND
THE LIGHTEST OF POSSIBLE MATTER FOR IT DEALS AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME
WITH THREE FORMS OF SUBSTANCE SOLID LIQUID AND FLUID AND IT MUST
DO BATTLE WITH ALL THREE
IT HAS ELEVEN CLAWS OF IRON WITH WHICH TO
SEIZE THE GRANITE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND MORE WINGS AND MORE
ANTENNAE THAN WINGED INSECTS TO CATCH THE WIND IN THE CLOUDS
ITS
BREATH POURS OUT THROUGH ITS HUNDRED AND TWENTY CANNONS AS THROUGH
ENORMOUS TRUMPETS AND REPLIES PROUDLY TO THE THUNDER
THE OCEAN SEEKS
TO LEAD IT ASTRAY IN THE ALARMING SAMENESS OF ITS BILLOWS BUT THE
VESSEL HAS ITS SOUL ITS COMPASS WHICH COUNSELS IT AND ALWAYS SHOWS IT
THE NORTH
IN THE BLACKEST NIGHTS ITS LANTERNS SUPPLY THE PLACE OF
THE STARS
THUS AGAINST THE WIND IT HAS ITS CORDAGE AND ITS CANVAS
AGAINST THE WATER WOOD AGAINST THE ROCKS ITS IRON BRASS AND LEAD
AGAINST THE SHADOWS ITS LIGHT AGAINST IMMENSITY A NEEDLE
IF ONE WISHES TO FORM AN IDEA OF ALL THOSE GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS WHICH
TAKEN AS A WHOLE CONSTITUTE THE SHIP OF THE LINE ONE HAS ONLY TO ENTER
ONE OF THE SIX STORY COVERED CONSTRUCTION STOCKS IN THE PORTS OF BREST
OR TOULON
THE VESSELS IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION ARE UNDER A BELL GLASS
THERE AS IT WERE
THIS COLOSSAL BEAM IS A YARD THAT GREAT COLUMN OF
WOOD WHICH STRETCHES OUT ON THE EARTH AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN REACH IS
THE MAIN MAST
TAKING IT FROM ITS ROOT IN THE STOCKS TO ITS TIP IN THE
CLOUDS IT IS SIXTY FATHOMS LONG AND ITS DIAMETER AT ITS BASE IS
THREE FEET
THE ENGLISH MAIN MAST RISES TO A HEIGHT OF TWO HUNDRED AND
SEVENTEEN FEET ABOVE THE WATER LINE
THE NAVY OF OUR FATHERS EMPLOYED
CABLES OURS EMPLOYS CHAINS
THE SIMPLE PILE OF CHAINS ON A SHIP OF A
HUNDRED GUNS IS FOUR FEET HIGH TWENTY FEET IN BREADTH AND EIGHT
FEET IN DEPTH
AND HOW MUCH WOOD IS REQUIRED TO MAKE THIS SHIP THREE
THOUSAND CUBIC METRES
IT IS A FLOATING FOREST
AND MOREOVER LET THIS BE BORNE IN MIND IT IS ONLY A QUESTION HERE OF
THE MILITARY VESSEL OF FORTY YEARS AGO OF THE SIMPLE SAILING VESSEL
STEAM THEN IN ITS INFANCY HAS SINCE ADDED NEW MIRACLES TO THAT PRODIGY
WHICH IS CALLED A WAR VESSEL
AT THE PRESENT TIME FOR EXAMPLE THE
MIXED VESSEL WITH A SCREW IS A SURPRISING MACHINE PROPELLED BY THREE
THOUSAND SQUARE METRES OF CANVAS AND BY AN ENGINE OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE
HUNDRED HORSE POWER
NOT TO MENTION THESE NEW MARVELS THE ANCIENT VESSEL OF CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS AND OF DE RUYTER IS ONE OF THE MASTERPIECES OF MAN
IT IS AS
INEXHAUSTIBLE IN FORCE AS IS THE INFINITE IN GALES IT STORES UP
THE WIND IN ITS SAILS IT IS PRECISE IN THE IMMENSE VAGUENESS OF THE
BILLOWS IT FLOATS AND IT REIGNS
THERE COMES AN HOUR NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE GALE BREAKS THAT SIXTY FOOT
YARD LIKE A STRAW WHEN THE WIND BENDS THAT MAST FOUR HUNDRED FEET TALL
WHEN THAT ANCHOR WHICH WEIGHS TENS OF THOUSANDS IS TWISTED IN THE JAWS
OF THE WAVES LIKE A FISHERMAN'S HOOK IN THE JAWS OF A PIKE WHEN THOSE
MONSTROUS CANNONS UTTER PLAINTIVE AND FUTILE ROARS WHICH THE HURRICANE
BEARS FORTH INTO THE VOID AND INTO NIGHT WHEN ALL THAT POWER AND ALL
THAT MAJESTY ARE ENGULFED IN A POWER AND MAJESTY WHICH ARE SUPERIOR
EVERY TIME THAT IMMENSE FORCE IS DISPLAYED TO CULMINATE IN AN IMMENSE
FEEBLENESS IT AFFORDS MEN FOOD FOR THOUGHT HENCE IN THE PORTS CURIOUS
PEOPLE ABOUND AROUND THESE MARVELLOUS MACHINES OF WAR AND OF NAVIGATION
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN PERFECTLY TO THEMSELVES WHY
EVERY DAY
ACCORDINGLY FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT THE QUAYS SLUICES AND THE
JETTIES OF THE PORT OF TOULON WERE COVERED WITH A MULTITUDE OF IDLERS
AND LOUNGERS AS THEY SAY IN PARIS WHOSE BUSINESS CONSISTED IN STARING
AT THE ORION
THE ORION WAS A SHIP THAT HAD BEEN AILING FOR A LONG TIME IN THE COURSE
OF ITS PREVIOUS CRUISES THICK LAYERS OF BARNACLES HAD COLLECTED ON ITS
KEEL TO SUCH A DEGREE AS TO DEPRIVE IT OF HALF ITS SPEED IT HAD GONE
INTO THE DRY DOCK THE YEAR BEFORE THIS IN ORDER TO HAVE THE BARNACLES
SCRAPED OFF THEN IT HAD PUT TO SEA AGAIN BUT THIS CLEANING HAD
AFFECTED THE BOLTS OF THE KEEL IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE BALEARIC
ISLES THE SIDES HAD BEEN STRAINED AND HAD OPENED AND AS THE PLATING
IN THOSE DAYS WAS NOT OF SHEET IRON THE VESSEL HAD SPRUNG A LEAK
A VIOLENT EQUINOCTIAL GALE HAD COME UP WHICH HAD FIRST STAVED IN
A GRATING AND A PORTHOLE ON THE LARBOARD SIDE AND DAMAGED THE
FORETOP GALLANT SHROUDS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THESE INJURIES THE ORION HAD
RUN BACK TO TOULON
IT ANCHORED NEAR THE ARSENAL IT WAS FULLY EQUIPPED AND REPAIRS WERE
BEGUN
THE HULL HAD RECEIVED NO DAMAGE ON THE STARBOARD BUT SOME OF THE
PLANKS HAD BEEN UNNAILED HERE AND THERE ACCORDING TO CUSTOM TO PERMIT
OF AIR ENTERING THE HOLD
ONE MORNING THE CROWD WHICH WAS GAZING AT IT WITNESSED AN ACCIDENT
ILLUSTRATION THE SHIP ORION AN ACCIDENT 2B2 1 THE SHIP ORION
THE CREW WAS BUSY BENDING THE SAILS THE TOPMAN WHO HAD TO TAKE THE
UPPER CORNER OF THE MAIN TOP SAIL ON THE STARBOARD LOST HIS BALANCE
HE WAS SEEN TO WAVER THE MULTITUDE THRONGING THE ARSENAL QUAY UTTERED A
CRY THE MAN'S HEAD OVERBALANCED HIS BODY THE MAN FELL AROUND THE YARD
WITH HIS HANDS OUTSTRETCHED TOWARDS THE ABYSS ON HIS WAY HE SEIZED THE
FOOTROPE FIRST WITH ONE HAND THEN WITH THE OTHER AND REMAINED HANGING
FROM IT THE SEA LAY BELOW HIM AT A DIZZY DEPTH THE SHOCK OF HIS FALL
HAD IMPARTED TO THE FOOT ROPE A VIOLENT SWINGING MOTION THE MAN SWAYED
BACK AND FORTH AT THE END OF THAT ROPE LIKE A STONE IN A SLING
IT WAS INCURRING A FRIGHTFUL RISK TO GO TO HIS ASSISTANCE NOT ONE
OF THE SAILORS ALL FISHERMEN OF THE COAST RECENTLY LEVIED FOR THE
SERVICE DARED TO ATTEMPT IT
IN THE MEANTIME THE UNFORTUNATE TOPMAN
WAS LOSING HIS STRENGTH HIS ANGUISH COULD NOT BE DISCERNED ON HIS FACE
BUT HIS EXHAUSTION WAS VISIBLE IN EVERY LIMB HIS ARMS WERE CONTRACTED
IN HORRIBLE TWITCHINGS EVERY EFFORT WHICH HE MADE TO RE ASCEND SERVED
BUT TO AUGMENT THE OSCILLATIONS OF THE FOOT ROPE HE DID NOT SHOUT FOR
FEAR OF EXHAUSTING HIS STRENGTH
ALL WERE AWAITING THE MINUTE WHEN HE
SHOULD RELEASE HIS HOLD ON THE ROPE AND FROM INSTANT TO INSTANT HEADS
WERE TURNED ASIDE THAT HIS FALL MIGHT NOT BE SEEN
THERE ARE MOMENTS
WHEN A BIT OF ROPE A POLE THE BRANCH OF A TREE IS LIFE ITSELF AND
IT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO SEE A LIVING BEING DETACH HIMSELF FROM IT AND
FALL LIKE A RIPE FRUIT
ALL AT ONCE A MAN WAS SEEN CLIMBING INTO THE RIGGING WITH THE AGILITY
OF A TIGER CAT THIS MAN WAS DRESSED IN RED HE WAS A CONVICT HE WORE A
GREEN CAP HE WAS A LIFE CONVICT
ON ARRIVING ON A LEVEL WITH THE TOP A
GUST OF WIND CARRIED AWAY HIS CAP AND ALLOWED A PERFECTLY WHITE HEAD TO
BE SEEN HE WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN
A CONVICT EMPLOYED ON BOARD WITH A DETACHMENT FROM THE GALLEYS HAD IN
FACT AT THE VERY FIRST INSTANT HASTENED TO THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH
AND IN THE MIDST OF THE CONSTERNATION AND THE HESITATION OF THE CREW
WHILE ALL THE SAILORS WERE TREMBLING AND DRAWING BACK HE HAD ASKED
THE OFFICER'S PERMISSION TO RISK HIS LIFE TO SAVE THE TOPMAN AT AN
AFFIRMATIVE SIGN FROM THE OFFICER HE HAD BROKEN THE CHAIN RIVETED TO HIS
ANKLE WITH ONE BLOW OF A HAMMER THEN HE HAD CAUGHT UP A ROPE AND HAD
DASHED INTO THE RIGGING NO ONE NOTICED AT THE INSTANT WITH WHAT EASE
THAT CHAIN HAD BEEN BROKEN IT WAS ONLY LATER ON THAT THE INCIDENT WAS
RECALLED
IN A TWINKLING HE WAS ON THE YARD HE PAUSED FOR A FEW SECONDS AND
APPEARED TO BE MEASURING IT WITH HIS EYE THESE SECONDS DURING WHICH
THE BREEZE SWAYED THE TOPMAN AT THE EXTREMITY OF A THREAD SEEMED
CENTURIES TO THOSE WHO WERE LOOKING ON
AT LAST THE CONVICT RAISED HIS
EYES TO HEAVEN AND ADVANCED A STEP THE CROWD DREW A LONG BREATH
HE WAS
SEEN TO RUN OUT ALONG THE YARD ON ARRIVING AT THE POINT HE FASTENED
THE ROPE WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT TO IT AND ALLOWED THE OTHER END TO HANG
DOWN THEN HE BEGAN TO DESCEND THE ROPE HAND OVER HAND AND THEN AND
THE ANGUISH WAS INDESCRIBABLE INSTEAD OF ONE MAN SUSPENDED OVER THE
GULF THERE WERE TWO
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID IT WAS A SPIDER COMING TO SEIZE A FLY ONLY HERE THE
SPIDER BROUGHT LIFE NOT DEATH
TEN THOUSAND GLANCES WERE FASTENED ON
THIS GROUP NOT A CRY NOT A WORD THE SAME TREMOR CONTRACTED EVERY
BROW ALL MOUTHS HELD THEIR BREATH AS THOUGH THEY FEARED TO ADD THE
SLIGHTEST PUFF TO THE WIND WHICH WAS SWAYING THE TWO UNFORTUNATE MEN
IN THE MEANTIME THE CONVICT HAD SUCCEEDED IN LOWERING HIMSELF TO A
POSITION NEAR THE SAILOR
IT WAS HIGH TIME ONE MINUTE MORE AND THE
EXHAUSTED AND DESPAIRING MAN WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO FALL INTO
THE ABYSS
THE CONVICT HAD MOORED HIM SECURELY WITH THE CORD TO WHICH
HE CLUNG WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE WAS WORKING WITH THE OTHER
AT LAST HE
WAS SEEN TO CLIMB BACK ON THE YARD AND TO DRAG THE SAILOR UP AFTER HIM
HE HELD HIM THERE A MOMENT TO ALLOW HIM TO RECOVER HIS STRENGTH THEN HE
GRASPED HIM IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HIM WALKING ON THE YARD HIMSELF TO
THE CAP AND FROM THERE TO THE MAIN TOP WHERE HE LEFT HIM IN THE HANDS
OF HIS COMRADES
AT THAT MOMENT THE CROWD BROKE INTO APPLAUSE OLD CONVICT SERGEANTS
AMONG THEM WEPT AND WOMEN EMBRACED EACH OTHER ON THE QUAY AND ALL
VOICES WERE HEARD TO CRY WITH A SORT OF TENDER RAGE PARDON FOR THAT
MAN
HE IN THE MEANTIME HAD IMMEDIATELY BEGUN TO MAKE HIS DESCENT TO REJOIN
HIS DETACHMENT
IN ORDER TO REACH THEM THE MORE SPEEDILY HE DROPPED
INTO THE RIGGING AND RAN ALONG ONE OF THE LOWER YARDS ALL EYES WERE
FOLLOWING HIM
AT A CERTAIN MOMENT FEAR ASSAILED THEM WHETHER IT WAS
THAT HE WAS FATIGUED OR THAT HIS HEAD TURNED THEY THOUGHT THEY SAW HIM
HESITATE AND STAGGER
ALL AT ONCE THE CROWD UTTERED A LOUD SHOUT THE
CONVICT HAD FALLEN INTO THE SEA
THE FALL WAS PERILOUS
THE FRIGATE ALGESIRAS WAS ANCHORED ALONGSIDE THE
ORION AND THE POOR CONVICT HAD FALLEN BETWEEN THE TWO VESSELS IT WAS
TO BE FEARED THAT HE WOULD SLIP UNDER ONE OR THE OTHER OF THEM
FOUR MEN
FLUNG THEMSELVES HASTILY INTO A BOAT THE CROWD CHEERED THEM ON
ANXIETY AGAIN TOOK POSSESSION OF ALL SOULS THE MAN HAD NOT RISEN TO
THE SURFACE HE HAD DISAPPEARED IN THE SEA WITHOUT LEAVING A RIPPLE AS
THOUGH HE HAD FALLEN INTO A CASK OF OIL THEY SOUNDED THEY DIVED
IN
VAIN
THE SEARCH WAS CONTINUED UNTIL THE EVENING THEY DID NOT EVEN FIND
THE BODY
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TOULON NEWSPAPER PRINTED THESE LINES
NOV
17 1823
YESTERDAY A CONVICT BELONGING TO THE DETACHMENT ON
BOARD OF THE ORION ON HIS RETURN FROM RENDERING ASSISTANCE TO A SAILOR
FELL INTO THE SEA AND WAS DROWNED
THE BODY HAS NOT YET BEEN FOUND IT
IS SUPPOSED THAT IT IS ENTANGLED AMONG THE PILES OF THE ARSENAL POINT
THIS MAN WAS COMMITTED UNDER THE NUMBER 9 430 AND HIS NAME WAS JEAN
VALJEAN
BOOK THIRD ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE TO THE DEAD WOMAN
CHAPTER I THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEIL
MONTFERMEIL IS SITUATED BETWEEN LIVRY AND CHELLES ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE
OF THAT LOFTY TABLE LAND WHICH SEPARATES THE OURCQ FROM THE MARNE
AT
THE PRESENT DAY IT IS A TOLERABLY LARGE TOWN ORNAMENTED ALL THE YEAR
THROUGH WITH PLASTER VILLAS AND ON SUNDAYS WITH BEAMING BOURGEOIS
IN
1823 THERE WERE AT MONTFERMEIL NEITHER SO MANY WHITE HOUSES NOR SO
MANY WELL SATISFIED CITIZENS IT WAS ONLY A VILLAGE IN THE FOREST
SOME
PLEASURE HOUSES OF THE LAST CENTURY WERE TO BE MET WITH THERE TO BE
SURE WHICH WERE RECOGNIZABLE BY THEIR GRAND AIR THEIR BALCONIES IN
TWISTED IRON AND THEIR LONG WINDOWS WHOSE TINY PANES CAST ALL SORTS
OF VARYING SHADES OF GREEN ON THE WHITE OF THE CLOSED SHUTTERS BUT
MONTFERMEIL WAS NONE THE LESS A VILLAGE
RETIRED CLOTH MERCHANTS AND
RUSTICATING ATTORNEYS HAD NOT DISCOVERED IT AS YET IT WAS A PEACEFUL
AND CHARMING PLACE WHICH WAS NOT ON THE ROAD TO ANYWHERE THERE PEOPLE
LIVED AND CHEAPLY THAT PEASANT RUSTIC LIFE WHICH IS SO BOUNTEOUS AND
SO EASY ONLY WATER WAS RARE THERE ON ACCOUNT OF THE ELEVATION OF THE
PLATEAU
IT WAS NECESSARY TO FETCH IT FROM A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE THE END OF
THE VILLAGE TOWARDS GAGNY DREW ITS WATER FROM THE MAGNIFICENT PONDS
WHICH EXIST IN THE WOODS THERE
THE OTHER END WHICH SURROUNDS THE
CHURCH AND WHICH LIES IN THE DIRECTION OF CHELLES FOUND DRINKING WATER
ONLY AT A LITTLE SPRING HALF WAY DOWN THE SLOPE NEAR THE ROAD TO
CHELLES ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FROM MONTFERMEIL
THUS EACH HOUSEHOLD FOUND IT HARD WORK TO KEEP SUPPLIED WITH WATER
THE
LARGE HOUSES THE ARISTOCRACY OF WHICH THE THENARDIER TAVERN FORMED A
PART PAID HALF A FARTHING A BUCKETFUL TO A MAN WHO MADE A BUSINESS OF
IT AND WHO EARNED ABOUT EIGHT SOUS A DAY IN HIS ENTERPRISE OF SUPPLYING
MONTFERMEIL WITH WATER BUT THIS GOOD MAN ONLY WORKED UNTIL SEVEN
O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND FIVE IN WINTER AND NIGHT ONCE
COME AND THE SHUTTERS ON THE GROUND FLOOR ONCE CLOSED HE WHO HAD NO
WATER TO DRINK WENT TO FETCH IT FOR HIMSELF OR DID WITHOUT IT
THIS CONSTITUTED THE TERROR OF THE POOR CREATURE WHOM THE READER HAS
PROBABLY NOT FORGOTTEN LITTLE COSETTE
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT
COSETTE WAS USEFUL TO THE THENARDIERS IN TWO WAYS THEY MADE THE MOTHER
PAY THEM AND THEY MADE THE CHILD SERVE THEM
SO WHEN THE MOTHER CEASED
TO PAY ALTOGETHER THE REASON FOR WHICH WE HAVE READ IN PRECEDING
CHAPTERS THE THENARDIERS KEPT COSETTE
SHE TOOK THE PLACE OF A SERVANT
IN THEIR HOUSE
IN THIS CAPACITY SHE IT WAS WHO RAN TO FETCH WATER WHEN
IT WAS REQUIRED
SO THE CHILD WHO WAS GREATLY TERRIFIED AT THE IDEA OF
GOING TO THE SPRING AT NIGHT TOOK GREAT CARE THAT WATER SHOULD NEVER BE
LACKING IN THE HOUSE
CHRISTMAS OF THE YEAR 1823 WAS PARTICULARLY BRILLIANT AT MONTFERMEIL
THE BEGINNING OF THE WINTER HAD BEEN MILD THERE HAD BEEN NEITHER SNOW
NOR FROST UP TO THAT TIME
SOME MOUNTEBANKS FROM PARIS HAD OBTAINED
PERMISSION OF THE MAYOR TO ERECT THEIR BOOTHS IN THE PRINCIPAL STREET OF
THE VILLAGE AND A BAND OF ITINERANT MERCHANTS UNDER PROTECTION OF THE
SAME TOLERANCE HAD CONSTRUCTED THEIR STALLS ON THE CHURCH SQUARE
AND EVEN EXTENDED THEM INTO BOULANGER ALLEY WHERE AS THE READER WILL
PERHAPS REMEMBER THE THENARDIERS' HOSTELRY WAS SITUATED
THESE PEOPLE
FILLED THE INNS AND DRINKING SHOPS AND COMMUNICATED TO THAT TRANQUIL
LITTLE DISTRICT A NOISY AND JOYOUS LIFE
IN ORDER TO PLAY THE PART OF
A FAITHFUL HISTORIAN WE OUGHT EVEN TO ADD THAT AMONG THE CURIOSITIES
DISPLAYED IN THE SQUARE THERE WAS A MENAGERIE IN WHICH FRIGHTFUL
CLOWNS CLAD IN RAGS AND COMING NO ONE KNEW WHENCE EXHIBITED TO
THE PEASANTS OF MONTFERMEIL IN 1823 ONE OF THOSE HORRIBLE BRAZILIAN
VULTURES SUCH AS OUR ROYAL MUSEUM DID NOT POSSESS UNTIL 1845 AND WHICH
HAVE A TRICOLORED COCKADE FOR AN EYE
I BELIEVE THAT NATURALISTS CALL
THIS BIRD CARACARA POLYBORUS IT BELONGS TO THE ORDER OF THE APICIDES
AND TO THE FAMILY OF THE VULTURES
SOME GOOD OLD BONAPARTIST SOLDIERS
WHO HAD RETIRED TO THE VILLAGE WENT TO SEE THIS CREATURE WITH GREAT
DEVOTION
THE MOUNTEBANKS GAVE OUT THAT THE TRICOLORED COCKADE WAS A
UNIQUE PHENOMENON MADE BY GOD EXPRESSLY FOR THEIR MENAGERIE
ON CHRISTMAS EVE ITSELF A NUMBER OF MEN CARTERS AND PEDDLERS WERE
SEATED AT TABLE DRINKING AND SMOKING AROUND FOUR OR FIVE CANDLES IN
THE PUBLIC ROOM OF THENARDIER'S HOSTELRY
THIS ROOM RESEMBLED ALL
DRINKING SHOP ROOMS TABLES PEWTER JUGS BOTTLES DRINKERS SMOKERS
BUT LITTLE LIGHT AND A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE
THE DATE OF THE YEAR 1823
WAS INDICATED NEVERTHELESS BY TWO OBJECTS WHICH WERE THEN FASHIONABLE
IN THE BOURGEOIS CLASS TO WIT A KALEIDOSCOPE AND A LAMP OF RIBBED TIN
THE FEMALE THENARDIER WAS ATTENDING TO THE SUPPER WHICH WAS ROASTING IN
FRONT OF A CLEAR FIRE HER HUSBAND WAS DRINKING WITH HIS CUSTOMERS AND
TALKING POLITICS
BESIDES POLITICAL CONVERSATIONS WHICH HAD FOR THEIR PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS
THE SPANISH WAR AND M
LE DUC D'ANGOULEME STRICTLY LOCAL PARENTHESES
LIKE THE FOLLOWING WERE AUDIBLE AMID THE UPROAR
ABOUT NANTERRE AND SURESNES THE VINES HAVE FLOURISHED GREATLY
WHEN
TEN PIECES WERE RECKONED ON THERE HAVE BEEN TWELVE
THEY HAVE YIELDED A
GREAT DEAL OF JUICE UNDER THE PRESS BUT THE GRAPES CANNOT BE RIPE
IN THOSE PARTS THE GRAPES SHOULD NOT BE RIPE THE WINE TURNS OILY AS
SOON AS SPRING COMES THEN IT IS VERY THIN WINE THERE ARE WINES
POORER EVEN THAN THESE
THE GRAPES MUST BE GATHERED WHILE GREEN ETC
OR A MILLER WOULD CALL OUT
ARE WE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS IN THE SACKS WE FIND IN THEM A QUANTITY
OF SMALL SEED WHICH WE CANNOT SIFT OUT AND WHICH WE ARE OBLIGED TO SEND
THROUGH THE MILL STONES THERE ARE TARES FENNEL VETCHES HEMPSEED
FOX TAIL AND A HOST OF OTHER WEEDS NOT TO MENTION PEBBLES WHICH
ABOUND IN CERTAIN WHEAT ESPECIALLY IN BRETON WHEAT
I AM NOT FOND OF
GRINDING BRETON WHEAT ANY MORE THAN LONG SAWYERS LIKE TO SAW BEAMS WITH
NAILS IN THEM
YOU CAN JUDGE OF THE BAD DUST THAT MAKES IN GRINDING
AND
THEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN OF THE FLOUR
THEY ARE IN THE WRONG
THE FLOUR IS
NO FAULT OF OURS
IN A SPACE BETWEEN TWO WINDOWS A MOWER WHO WAS SEATED AT TABLE WITH A
LANDED PROPRIETOR WHO WAS FIXING ON A PRICE FOR SOME MEADOW WORK TO BE
PERFORMED IN THE SPRING WAS SAYING
IT DOES NO HARM TO HAVE THE GRASS WET
IT CUTS BETTER
DEW IS A GOOD
THING SIR
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WITH THAT GRASS
YOUR GRASS IS YOUNG
AND VERY HARD TO CUT STILL
IT'S TERRIBLY TENDER
IT YIELDS BEFORE THE
IRON ETC
COSETTE WAS IN HER USUAL PLACE SEATED ON THE CROSS BAR OF THE KITCHEN
TABLE NEAR THE CHIMNEY
SHE WAS IN RAGS HER BARE FEET WERE THRUST INTO
WOODEN SHOES AND BY THE FIRELIGHT SHE WAS ENGAGED IN KNITTING WOOLLEN
STOCKINGS DESTINED FOR THE YOUNG THENARDIERS
A VERY YOUNG KITTEN WAS
PLAYING ABOUT AMONG THE CHAIRS
LAUGHTER AND CHATTER WERE AUDIBLE IN
THE ADJOINING ROOM FROM TWO FRESH CHILDREN'S VOICES IT WAS EPONINE AND
AZELMA
IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER A CAT O' NINE TAILS WAS HANGING ON A NAIL
AT INTERVALS THE CRY OF A VERY YOUNG CHILD WHICH WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE
HOUSE RANG THROUGH THE NOISE OF THE DRAM SHOP
IT WAS A LITTLE BOY
WHO HAD BEEN BORN TO THE THENARDIERS DURING ONE OF THE PRECEDING
WINTERS SHE DID NOT KNOW WHY SHE SAID THE RESULT OF THE
COLD AND WHO WAS A LITTLE MORE THAN THREE YEARS OLD
THE MOTHER HAD
NURSED HIM BUT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM
WHEN THE PERSISTENT CLAMOR OF THE
BRAT BECAME TOO ANNOYING YOUR SON IS SQUALLING THENARDIER WOULD
SAY DO GO AND SEE WHAT HE WANTS BAH THE MOTHER WOULD REPLY HE
BOTHERS ME AND THE NEGLECTED CHILD CONTINUED TO SHRIEK IN THE DARK
CHAPTER II TWO COMPLETE PORTRAITS
SO FAR IN THIS BOOK THE THENARDIERS HAVE BEEN VIEWED ONLY IN PROFILE
THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED FOR MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THIS COUPLE AND
CONSIDERING IT UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS
THENARDIER HAD JUST PASSED HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY MADAME THENARDIER WAS
APPROACHING HER FORTIES WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO FIFTY IN A WOMAN SO
THAT THERE EXISTED A BALANCE OF AGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE
OUR READERS HAVE POSSIBLY PRESERVED SOME RECOLLECTION OF THIS THENARDIER
WOMAN EVER SINCE HER FIRST APPEARANCE TALL BLOND RED FAT ANGULAR
SQUARE ENORMOUS AND AGILE SHE BELONGED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE
RACE OF THOSE COLOSSAL WILD WOMEN WHO CONTORT THEMSELVES AT FAIRS WITH
PAVING STONES HANGING FROM THEIR HAIR
SHE DID EVERYTHING ABOUT THE
HOUSE MADE THE BEDS DID THE WASHING THE COOKING AND EVERYTHING
ELSE
COSETTE WAS HER ONLY SERVANT A MOUSE IN THE SERVICE OF AN
ELEPHANT
EVERYTHING TREMBLED AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WINDOW PANES
FURNITURE AND PEOPLE
HER BIG FACE DOTTED WITH RED BLOTCHES
PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF A SKIMMER
SHE HAD A BEARD
SHE WAS AN IDEAL
MARKET PORTER DRESSED IN WOMAN'S CLOTHES
SHE SWORE SPLENDIDLY SHE
BOASTED OF BEING ABLE TO CRACK A NUT WITH ONE BLOW OF HER FIST
EXCEPT
FOR THE ROMANCES WHICH SHE HAD READ AND WHICH MADE THE AFFECTED LADY
PEEP THROUGH THE OGRESS AT TIMES IN A VERY QUEER WAY THE IDEA WOULD
NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO SAY OF HER THAT IS A WOMAN
THIS THENARDIER FEMALE WAS LIKE THE PRODUCT OF A WENCH ENGRAFTED ON A
FISHWIFE
WHEN ONE HEARD HER SPEAK ONE SAID THAT IS A GENDARME WHEN
ONE SAW HER DRINK ONE SAID THAT IS A CARTER WHEN ONE SAW HER HANDLE
COSETTE ONE SAID THAT IS THE HANGMAN ONE OF HER TEETH PROJECTED
WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE
THENARDIER WAS A SMALL THIN PALE ANGULAR BONY FEEBLE MAN WHO HAD
A SICKLY AIR AND WHO WAS WONDERFULLY HEALTHY
HIS CUNNING BEGAN HERE
HE SMILED HABITUALLY BY WAY OF PRECAUTION AND WAS ALMOST POLITE TO
EVERYBODY EVEN TO THE BEGGAR TO WHOM HE REFUSED HALF A FARTHING
HE HAD
THE GLANCE OF A POLE CAT AND THE BEARING OF A MAN OF LETTERS
HE GREATLY
RESEMBLED THE PORTRAITS OF THE ABBE DELILLE
HIS COQUETRY CONSISTED IN
DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS
NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING HIM
DRUNK
HE SMOKED A BIG PIPE
HE WORE A BLOUSE AND UNDER HIS BLOUSE AN
OLD BLACK COAT
HE MADE PRETENSIONS TO LITERATURE AND TO MATERIALISM
THERE WERE CERTAIN NAMES WHICH HE OFTEN PRONOUNCED TO SUPPORT WHATEVER
THINGS HE MIGHT BE SAYING VOLTAIRE RAYNAL PARNY AND SINGULARLY
ENOUGH SAINT AUGUSTINE
HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD A SYSTEM IN
ADDITION HE WAS A GREAT SWINDLER
A FILOUSOPHE PHILOSOPHE A
SCIENTIFIC THIEF
THE SPECIES DOES EXIST
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE
PRETENDED TO HAVE SERVED IN THE ARMY HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF RELATING
WITH EXUBERANCE HOW BEING A SERGEANT IN THE 6TH OR THE 9TH LIGHT
SOMETHING OR OTHER AT WATERLOO HE HAD ALONE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF A
SQUADRON OF DEATH DEALING HUSSARS COVERED WITH HIS BODY AND SAVED
FROM DEATH IN THE MIDST OF THE GRAPE SHOT A GENERAL WHO HAD BEEN
DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED THENCE AROSE FOR HIS WALL THE FLARING SIGN AND
FOR HIS INN THE NAME WHICH IT BORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CABARET
OF THE SERGEANT OF WATERLOO HE WAS A LIBERAL A CLASSIC AND A
BONAPARTIST
HE HAD SUBSCRIBED FOR THE CHAMP D'ASILE
IT WAS SAID IN THE
VILLAGE THAT HE HAD STUDIED FOR THE PRIESTHOOD
WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY STUDIED IN HOLLAND FOR AN INN KEEPER
THIS
RASCAL OF COMPOSITE ORDER WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME FLEMING FROM
LILLE IN FLANDERS A FRENCHMAN IN PARIS A BELGIAN AT BRUSSELS BEING
COMFORTABLY ASTRIDE OF BOTH FRONTIERS
AS FOR HIS PROWESS AT WATERLOO
THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THAT
IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT
HE EXAGGERATED IT A TRIFLE
EBB AND FLOW WANDERING ADVENTURE WAS
THE LEVEN OF HIS EXISTENCE A TATTERED CONSCIENCE ENTAILS A FRAGMENTARY
LIFE AND APPARENTLY AT THE STORMY EPOCH OF JUNE 18 1815 THENARDIER
BELONGED TO THAT VARIETY OF MARAUDING SUTLERS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
BEATING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SELLING TO SOME STEALING FROM OTHERS AND
TRAVELLING LIKE A FAMILY MAN WITH WIFE AND CHILDREN IN A RICKETY
CART IN THE REAR OF TROOPS ON THE MARCH WITH AN INSTINCT FOR ALWAYS
ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMY
THIS CAMPAIGN ENDED AND
HAVING AS HE SAID SOME QUIBUS HE HAD COME TO MONTFERMEIL AND SET UP
AN INN THERE
THIS QUIBUS COMPOSED OF PURSES AND WATCHES OF GOLD RINGS AND SILVER
CROSSES GATHERED IN HARVEST TIME IN FURROWS SOWN WITH CORPSES DID
NOT AMOUNT TO A LARGE TOTAL AND DID NOT CARRY THIS SUTLER TURNED
EATING HOUSE KEEPER VERY FAR
THENARDIER HAD THAT PECULIAR RECTILINEAR SOMETHING ABOUT HIS GESTURES
WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY AN OATH RECALLS THE BARRACKS AND BY A SIGN
OF THE CROSS THE SEMINARY
HE WAS A FINE TALKER
HE ALLOWED IT TO BE
THOUGHT THAT HE WAS AN EDUCATED MAN
NEVERTHELESS THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD
NOTICED THAT HE PRONOUNCED IMPROPERLY 12
HE COMPOSED THE TRAVELLERS' TARIFF CARD IN A SUPERIOR MANNER BUT
PRACTISED EYES SOMETIMES SPIED OUT ORTHOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN IT
THENARDIER WAS CUNNING GREEDY SLOTHFUL AND CLEVER
HE DID NOT DISDAIN
HIS SERVANTS WHICH CAUSED HIS WIFE TO DISPENSE WITH THEM
THIS GIANTESS
WAS JEALOUS
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THAT THIN AND YELLOW LITTLE MAN MUST
BE AN OBJECT COVETED BY ALL
THENARDIER WHO WAS ABOVE ALL AN ASTUTE AND WELL BALANCED MAN WAS A
SCAMP OF A TEMPERATE SORT
THIS IS THE WORST SPECIES HYPOCRISY ENTERS
INTO IT
IT IS NOT THAT THENARDIER WAS NOT ON OCCASION CAPABLE OF WRATH TO
QUITE THE SAME DEGREE AS HIS WIFE BUT THIS WAS VERY RARE AND AT SUCH
TIMES SINCE HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE HUMAN RACE IN GENERAL AS HE BORE
WITHIN HIM A DEEP FURNACE OF HATRED
AND SINCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY AVENGING THEIR WRONGS WHO ACCUSE EVERYTHING
THAT PASSES BEFORE THEM OF EVERYTHING WHICH HAS BEFALLEN THEM AND WHO
ARE ALWAYS READY TO CAST UPON THE FIRST PERSON WHO COMES TO HAND AS A
LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCE THE SUM TOTAL OF THE DECEPTIONS THE BANKRUPTCIES
AND THE CALAMITIES OF THEIR LIVES WHEN ALL THIS LEAVEN WAS STIRRED UP
IN HIM AND BOILED FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HE WAS TERRIBLE
WOE TO
THE PERSON WHO CAME UNDER HIS WRATH AT SUCH A TIME
IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER QUALITIES THENARDIER WAS ATTENTIVE AND
PENETRATING SILENT OR TALKATIVE ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALWAYS
HIGHLY INTELLIGENT
HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE LOOK OF SAILORS WHO ARE
ACCUSTOMED TO SCREW UP THEIR EYES TO GAZE THROUGH MARINE GLASSES
THENARDIER WAS A STATESMAN
EVERY NEW COMER WHO ENTERED THE TAVERN SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MADAME
THENARDIER THERE IS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A MISTAKE
SHE WAS NOT
EVEN THE MISTRESS
THE HUSBAND WAS BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
SHE WORKED
HE CREATED
HE DIRECTED EVERYTHING BY A SORT OF INVISIBLE AND CONSTANT
MAGNETIC ACTION
A WORD WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM SOMETIMES A SIGN THE
MASTODON OBEYED
THENARDIER WAS A SORT OF SPECIAL AND SOVEREIGN BEING IN
MADAME THENARDIER'S EYES THOUGH SHE DID NOT THOROUGHLY REALIZE IT
SHE WAS POSSESSED OF VIRTUES AFTER HER OWN KIND IF SHE HAD EVER HAD A
DISAGREEMENT AS TO ANY DETAIL WITH MONSIEUR THENARDIER WHICH WAS
AN INADMISSIBLE HYPOTHESIS BY THE WAY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED
HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER
SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE
COMMITTED BEFORE STRANGERS THAT MISTAKE SO OFTEN COMMITTED BY WOMEN
AND WHICH IS CALLED IN PARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE EXPOSING THE CROWN
ALTHOUGH THEIR CONCORD HAD ONLY EVIL AS ITS RESULT THERE WAS
CONTEMPLATION IN MADAME THENARDIER'S SUBMISSION TO HER HUSBAND
THAT
MOUNTAIN OF NOISE AND OF FLESH MOVED UNDER THE LITTLE FINGER OF THAT
FRAIL DESPOT
VIEWED ON ITS DWARFED AND GROTESQUE SIDE THIS WAS THAT
GRAND AND UNIVERSAL THING THE ADORATION OF MIND BY MATTER FOR CERTAIN
UGLY FEATURES HAVE A CAUSE IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF ETERNAL BEAUTY
THERE
WAS AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY ABOUT THENARDIER HENCE THE ABSOLUTE EMPIRE
OF THE MAN OVER THAT WOMAN
AT CERTAIN MOMENTS SHE BEHELD HIM LIKE A
LIGHTED CANDLE AT OTHERS SHE FELT HIM LIKE A CLAW
THIS WOMAN WAS A FORMIDABLE CREATURE WHO LOVED NO ONE EXCEPT HER
CHILDREN AND WHO DID NOT FEAR ANY ONE EXCEPT HER HUSBAND
SHE WAS A
MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS MAMMIFEROUS
BUT HER MATERNITY STOPPED SHORT WITH
HER DAUGHTERS AND AS WE SHALL SEE DID NOT EXTEND TO BOYS
THE MAN HAD
BUT ONE THOUGHT HOW TO ENRICH HIMSELF
HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN THIS
A THEATRE WORTHY OF THIS GREAT TALENT WAS
LACKING
THENARDIER WAS RUINING HIMSELF AT MONTFERMEIL IF RUIN IS
POSSIBLE TO ZERO IN SWITZERLAND OR IN THE PYRENEES THIS PENNILESS SCAMP
WOULD HAVE BECOME A MILLIONAIRE BUT AN INN KEEPER MUST BROWSE WHERE
FATE HAS HITCHED HIM
IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORD INN KEEPER IS HERE EMPLOYED IN A
RESTRICTED SENSE AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO AN ENTIRE CLASS
IN THIS SAME YEAR 1823 THENARDIER WAS BURDENED WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN
HUNDRED FRANCS' WORTH OF PETTY DEBTS AND THIS RENDERED HIM ANXIOUS
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE OBSTINATE INJUSTICE OF DESTINY IN THIS CASE
THENARDIER WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO UNDERSTAND BEST WITH THE MOST
PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE
AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED
PEOPLES HOSPITALITY
BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER AND QUOTED
FOR HIS SKILL IN SHOOTING
HE HAD A CERTAIN COLD AND TRANQUIL LAUGH
WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS
HIS THEORIES AS A LANDLORD SOMETIMES BURST FORTH IN LIGHTNING FLASHES
HE HAD PROFESSIONAL APHORISMS WHICH HE INSERTED INTO HIS WIFE'S MIND
THE DUTY OF THE INN KEEPER HE SAID TO HER ONE DAY VIOLENTLY AND IN
A LOW VOICE IS TO SELL TO THE FIRST COMER STEWS REPOSE LIGHT FIRE
DIRTY SHEETS A SERVANT LICE AND A SMILE TO STOP PASSERS BY TO EMPTY
SMALL PURSES AND TO HONESTLY LIGHTEN HEAVY ONES TO SHELTER TRAVELLING
FAMILIES RESPECTFULLY TO SHAVE THE MAN TO PLUCK THE WOMAN TO PICK
THE CHILD CLEAN TO QUOTE THE WINDOW OPEN THE WINDOW SHUT THE
CHIMNEY CORNER THE ARM CHAIR THE CHAIR THE OTTOMAN THE STOOL THE
FEATHER BED THE MATTRESS AND THE TRUSS OF STRAW TO KNOW HOW MUCH
THE SHADOW USES UP THE MIRROR AND TO PUT A PRICE ON IT AND BY FIVE
HUNDRED THOUSAND DEVILS TO MAKE THE TRAVELLER PAY FOR EVERYTHING EVEN
FOR THE FLIES WHICH HIS DOG EATS
THIS MAN AND THIS WOMAN WERE RUSE AND RAGE WEDDED A HIDEOUS AND
TERRIBLE TEAM
WHILE THE HUSBAND PONDERED AND COMBINED MADAME THENARDIER THOUGHT NOT
OF ABSENT CREDITORS TOOK NO HEED OF YESTERDAY NOR OF TO MORROW AND
LIVED IN A FIT OF ANGER ALL IN A MINUTE
SUCH WERE THESE TWO BEINGS
COSETTE WAS BETWEEN THEM SUBJECTED TO THEIR
DOUBLE PRESSURE LIKE A CREATURE WHO IS AT THE SAME TIME BEING GROUND UP
IN A MILL AND PULLED TO PIECES WITH PINCERS
THE MAN AND THE WOMAN EACH
HAD A DIFFERENT METHOD COSETTE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH BLOWS THIS WAS THE
WOMAN'S SHE WENT BAREFOOTED IN WINTER THAT WAS THE MAN'S DOING
COSETTE RAN UP STAIRS AND DOWN WASHED SWEPT RUBBED DUSTED RAN
FLUTTERED ABOUT PANTED MOVED HEAVY ARTICLES AND WEAK AS SHE WAS
DID THE COARSE WORK
THERE WAS NO MERCY FOR HER A FIERCE MISTRESS AND
VENOMOUS MASTER
THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB IN
WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND WHERE SHE LAY TREMBLING
THE IDEAL
OF OPPRESSION WAS REALIZED BY THIS SINISTER HOUSEHOLD
IT WAS SOMETHING
LIKE THE FLY SERVING THE SPIDERS
THE POOR CHILD PASSIVELY HELD HER PEACE
WHAT TAKES PLACE WITHIN THESE SOULS WHEN THEY HAVE BUT JUST QUITTED GOD
FIND THEMSELVES THUS AT THE VERY DAWN OF LIFE VERY SMALL AND IN THE
MIDST OF MEN ALL NAKED
CHAPTER III MEN MUST HAVE WINE AND HORSES MUST HAVE WATER
FOUR NEW TRAVELLERS HAD ARRIVED
COSETTE WAS MEDITATING SADLY FOR ALTHOUGH SHE WAS ONLY EIGHT YEARS
OLD SHE HAD ALREADY SUFFERED SO MUCH THAT SHE REFLECTED WITH THE
LUGUBRIOUS AIR OF AN OLD WOMAN
HER EYE WAS BLACK IN CONSEQUENCE OF A
BLOW FROM MADAME THENARDIER'S FIST WHICH CAUSED THE LATTER TO REMARK
FROM TIME TO TIME HOW UGLY SHE IS WITH HER FIST BLOW ON HER EYE
COSETTE WAS THINKING THAT IT WAS DARK VERY DARK THAT THE PITCHERS AND
CARAFFES IN THE CHAMBERS OF THE TRAVELLERS WHO HAD ARRIVED MUST HAVE
BEEN FILLED AND THAT THERE WAS NO MORE WATER IN THE CISTERN
SHE WAS SOMEWHAT REASSURED BECAUSE NO ONE IN THE THENARDIER
ESTABLISHMENT DRANK MUCH WATER
THIRSTY PEOPLE WERE NEVER LACKING THERE
BUT THEIR THIRST WAS OF THE SORT WHICH APPLIES TO THE JUG RATHER THAN TO
THE PITCHER
ANY ONE WHO HAD ASKED FOR A GLASS OF WATER AMONG ALL THOSE
GLASSES OF WINE WOULD HAVE APPEARED A SAVAGE TO ALL THESE MEN
BUT THERE
CAME A MOMENT WHEN THE CHILD TREMBLED MADAME THENARDIER RAISED THE
COVER OF A STEW PAN WHICH WAS BOILING ON THE STOVE THEN SEIZED A GLASS
AND BRISKLY APPROACHED THE CISTERN
SHE TURNED THE FAUCET THE CHILD
HAD RAISED HER HEAD AND WAS FOLLOWING ALL THE WOMAN'S MOVEMENTS
A THIN
STREAM OF WATER TRICKLED FROM THE FAUCET AND HALF FILLED THE GLASS
WELL SAID SHE THERE IS NO MORE WATER A MOMENTARY SILENCE ENSUED
THE CHILD DID NOT BREATHE
BAH RESUMED MADAME THENARDIER EXAMINING THE HALF FILLED GLASS THIS
WILL BE ENOUGH
COSETTE APPLIED HERSELF TO HER WORK ONCE MORE BUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN
HOUR SHE FELT HER HEART LEAPING IN HER BOSOM LIKE A BIG SNOW FLAKE
SHE COUNTED THE MINUTES THAT PASSED IN THIS MANNER AND WISHED IT WERE
THE NEXT MORNING
FROM TIME TO TIME ONE OF THE DRINKERS LOOKED INTO THE STREET AND
EXCLAIMED IT'S AS BLACK AS AN OVEN OR ONE MUST NEEDS BE A CAT
TO GO ABOUT THE STREETS WITHOUT A LANTERN AT THIS HOUR AND COSETTE
TREMBLED
ALL AT ONCE ONE OF THE PEDLERS WHO LODGED IN THE HOSTELRY ENTERED AND
SAID IN A HARSH VOICE
MY HORSE HAS NOT BEEN WATERED
YES IT HAS SAID MADAME THENARDIER
I TELL YOU THAT IT HAS NOT RETORTED THE PEDLER
COSETTE HAD EMERGED FROM UNDER THE TABLE
OH YES SIR SAID SHE THE HORSE HAS HAD A DRINK HE DRANK OUT OF A
BUCKET A WHOLE BUCKETFUL AND IT WAS I WHO TOOK THE WATER TO HIM AND I
SPOKE TO HIM
IT WAS NOT TRUE COSETTE LIED
THERE'S A BRAT AS BIG AS MY FIST WHO TELLS LIES AS BIG AS THE HOUSE
EXCLAIMED THE PEDLER
I TELL YOU THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN WATERED YOU
LITTLE JADE HE HAS A WAY OF BLOWING WHEN HE HAS HAD NO WATER WHICH I
KNOW WELL
COSETTE PERSISTED AND ADDED IN A VOICE RENDERED HOARSE WITH ANGUISH
AND WHICH WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE
AND HE DRANK HEARTILY
COME SAID THE PEDLER IN A RAGE THIS WON'T DO AT ALL LET MY HORSE
BE WATERED AND LET THAT BE THE END OF IT
COSETTE CREPT UNDER THE TABLE AGAIN
IN TRUTH THAT IS FAIR SAID MADAME THENARDIER IF THE BEAST HAS NOT
BEEN WATERED IT MUST BE
THEN GLANCING ABOUT HER
WELL NOW WHERE'S THAT OTHER BEAST
SHE BENT DOWN AND DISCOVERED COSETTE COWERING AT THE OTHER END OF THE
TABLE ALMOST UNDER THE DRINKERS' FEET
ARE YOU COMING SHRIEKED MADAME THENARDIER
COSETTE CRAWLED OUT OF THE SORT OF HOLE IN WHICH SHE HAD HIDDEN HERSELF
THE THENARDIER RESUMED
MADEMOISELLE DOG LACK NAME GO AND WATER THAT HORSE
BUT MADAME SAID COSETTE FEEBLY THERE IS NO WATER
THE THENARDIER THREW THE STREET DOOR WIDE OPEN
WELL GO AND GET SOME THEN
COSETTE DROPPED HER HEAD AND WENT FOR AN EMPTY BUCKET WHICH STOOD NEAR
THE CHIMNEY CORNER
THIS BUCKET WAS BIGGER THAN SHE WAS AND THE CHILD COULD HAVE SET DOWN
IN IT AT HER EASE
THE THENARDIER RETURNED TO HER STOVE AND TASTED WHAT WAS IN THE
STEWPAN WITH A WOODEN SPOON GRUMBLING THE WHILE
THERE'S PLENTY IN THE SPRING
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A MALICIOUS CREATURE
AS THAT
I THINK I SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO STRAIN MY ONIONS
THEN SHE RUMMAGED IN A DRAWER WHICH CONTAINED SOUS PEPPER AND
SHALLOTS
SEE HERE MAM'SELLE TOAD SHE ADDED ON YOUR WAY BACK YOU WILL GET A
BIG LOAF FROM THE BAKER
HERE'S A FIFTEEN SOU PIECE
COSETTE HAD A LITTLE POCKET ON ONE SIDE OF HER APRON SHE TOOK THE COIN
WITHOUT SAYING A WORD AND PUT IT IN THAT POCKET
THEN SHE STOOD MOTIONLESS BUCKET IN HAND THE OPEN DOOR BEFORE HER
SHE
SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOME ONE TO COME TO HER RESCUE
GET ALONG WITH YOU SCREAMED THE THENARDIER
COSETTE WENT OUT
THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HER
CHAPTER IV ENTRANCE ON THE SCENE OF A DOLL
THE LINE OF OPEN AIR BOOTHS STARTING AT THE CHURCH EXTENDED AS THE
READER WILL REMEMBER AS FAR AS THE HOSTELRY OF THE THENARDIERS
THESE
BOOTHS WERE ALL ILLUMINATED BECAUSE THE CITIZENS WOULD SOON PASS ON
THEIR WAY TO THE MIDNIGHT MASS WITH CANDLES BURNING IN PAPER FUNNELS
WHICH AS THE SCHOOLMASTER THEN SEATED AT THE TABLE AT THE THENARDIERS'
OBSERVED PRODUCED A MAGICAL EFFECT IN COMPENSATION NOT A STAR WAS
VISIBLE IN THE SKY
THE LAST OF THESE STALLS ESTABLISHED PRECISELY OPPOSITE THE
THENARDIERS' DOOR WAS A TOY SHOP ALL GLITTERING WITH TINSEL GLASS
AND MAGNIFICENT OBJECTS OF TIN
IN THE FIRST ROW AND FAR FORWARDS THE
MERCHANT HAD PLACED ON A BACKGROUND OF WHITE NAPKINS AN IMMENSE DOLL
NEARLY TWO FEET HIGH WHO WAS DRESSED IN A ROBE OF PINK CREPE WITH GOLD
WHEAT EARS ON HER HEAD WHICH HAD REAL HAIR AND ENAMEL EYES
ALL THAT
DAY THIS MARVEL HAD BEEN DISPLAYED TO THE WONDERMENT OF ALL PASSERS BY
UNDER TEN YEARS OF AGE WITHOUT A MOTHER BEING FOUND IN MONTFERMEIL
SUFFICIENTLY RICH OR SUFFICIENTLY EXTRAVAGANT TO GIVE IT TO HER CHILD
EPONINE AND AZELMA HAD PASSED HOURS IN CONTEMPLATING IT AND COSETTE
HERSELF HAD VENTURED TO CAST A GLANCE AT IT ON THE SLY IT IS TRUE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN COSETTE EMERGED BUCKET IN HAND MELANCHOLY AND
OVERCOME AS SHE WAS SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM LIFTING HER EYES TO
THAT WONDERFUL DOLL TOWARDS THE LADY AS SHE CALLED IT
THE POOR CHILD
PAUSED IN AMAZEMENT
SHE HAD NOT YET BEHELD THAT DOLL CLOSE TO
THE
WHOLE SHOP SEEMED A PALACE TO HER THE DOLL WAS NOT A DOLL IT WAS A
VISION
IT WAS JOY SPLENDOR RICHES HAPPINESS WHICH APPEARED IN
A SORT OF CHIMERICAL HALO TO THAT UNHAPPY LITTLE BEING SO PROFOUNDLY
ENGULFED IN GLOOMY AND CHILLY MISERY
WITH THE SAD AND INNOCENT SAGACITY
OF CHILDHOOD COSETTE MEASURED THE ABYSS WHICH SEPARATED HER FROM
THAT DOLL
SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT ONE MUST BE A QUEEN OR AT LEAST A
PRINCESS TO HAVE A THING LIKE THAT
SHE GAZED AT THAT BEAUTIFUL PINK
DRESS THAT BEAUTIFUL SMOOTH HAIR AND SHE THOUGHT HOW HAPPY THAT DOLL
MUST BE SHE COULD NOT TAKE HER EYES FROM THAT FANTASTIC STALL
THE
MORE SHE LOOKED THE MORE DAZZLED SHE GREW
SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GAZING
AT PARADISE
THERE WERE OTHER DOLLS BEHIND THE LARGE ONE WHICH SEEMED
TO HER TO BE FAIRIES AND GENII
THE MERCHANT WHO WAS PACING BACK AND
FORTH IN FRONT OF HIS SHOP PRODUCED ON HER SOMEWHAT THE EFFECT OF BEING
THE ETERNAL FATHER
IN THIS ADORATION SHE FORGOT EVERYTHING EVEN THE ERRAND WITH WHICH SHE
WAS CHARGED
ALL AT ONCE THE THENARDIER'S COARSE VOICE RECALLED HER TO REALITY
WHAT YOU SILLY JADE YOU HAVE NOT GONE WAIT I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU I
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING THERE GET ALONG YOU LITTLE MONSTER
THE THENARDIER HAD CAST A GLANCE INTO THE STREET AND HAD CAUGHT SIGHT
OF COSETTE IN HER ECSTASY
COSETTE FLED DRAGGING HER PAIL AND TAKING THE LONGEST STRIDES OF WHICH
SHE WAS CAPABLE
CHAPTER V THE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONE
AS THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS IN THAT PART OF THE VILLAGE WHICH IS
NEAR THE CHURCH IT WAS TO THE SPRING IN THE FOREST IN THE DIRECTION OF
CHELLES THAT COSETTE WAS OBLIGED TO GO FOR HER WATER
SHE DID NOT GLANCE AT THE DISPLAY OF A SINGLE OTHER MERCHANT
SO LONG
AS SHE WAS IN BOULANGER LANE AND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CHURCH THE
LIGHTED STALLS ILLUMINATED THE ROAD BUT SOON THE LAST LIGHT FROM THE
LAST STALL VANISHED
THE POOR CHILD FOUND HERSELF IN THE DARK
SHE
PLUNGED INTO IT
ONLY AS A CERTAIN EMOTION OVERCAME HER SHE MADE AS
MUCH MOTION AS POSSIBLE WITH THE HANDLE OF THE BUCKET AS SHE WALKED
ALONG
THIS MADE A NOISE WHICH AFFORDED HER COMPANY
THE FURTHER SHE WENT THE DENSER THE DARKNESS BECAME
THERE WAS NO ONE
IN THE STREETS
HOWEVER SHE DID ENCOUNTER A WOMAN WHO TURNED AROUND
ON SEEING HER AND STOOD STILL MUTTERING BETWEEN HER TEETH WHERE CAN
THAT CHILD BE GOING IS IT A WEREWOLF CHILD THEN THE WOMAN RECOGNIZED
COSETTE
WELL SAID SHE IT'S THE LARK
IN THIS MANNER COSETTE TRAVERSED THE LABYRINTH OF TORTUOUS AND DESERTED
STREETS WHICH TERMINATE IN THE VILLAGE OF MONTFERMEIL ON THE SIDE OF
CHELLES
SO LONG AS SHE HAD THE HOUSES OR EVEN THE WALLS ONLY ON BOTH
SIDES OF HER PATH SHE PROCEEDED WITH TOLERABLE BOLDNESS
FROM TIME
TO TIME SHE CAUGHT THE FLICKER OF A CANDLE THROUGH THE CRACK OF A
SHUTTER THIS WAS LIGHT AND LIFE THERE WERE PEOPLE THERE AND IT
REASSURED HER
BUT IN PROPORTION AS SHE ADVANCED HER PACE SLACKENED
MECHANICALLY AS IT WERE
WHEN SHE HAD PASSED THE CORNER OF THE LAST
HOUSE COSETTE PAUSED
IT HAD BEEN HARD TO ADVANCE FURTHER THAN THE LAST
STALL IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED FURTHER THAN THE LAST HOUSE
SHE
SET HER BUCKET ON THE GROUND THRUST HER HAND INTO HER HAIR AND
BEGAN SLOWLY TO SCRATCH HER HEAD A GESTURE PECULIAR TO CHILDREN WHEN
TERRIFIED AND UNDECIDED WHAT TO DO
IT WAS NO LONGER MONTFERMEIL IT
WAS THE OPEN FIELDS
BLACK AND DESERT SPACE WAS BEFORE HER
SHE GAZED IN
DESPAIR AT THAT DARKNESS WHERE THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ONE WHERE THERE
WERE BEASTS WHERE THERE WERE SPECTRES POSSIBLY
SHE TOOK A GOOD
LOOK AND HEARD THE BEASTS WALKING ON THE GRASS AND SHE DISTINCTLY SAW
SPECTRES MOVING IN THE TREES
THEN SHE SEIZED HER BUCKET AGAIN FEAR HAD
LENT HER AUDACITY
BAH SAID SHE I WILL TELL HIM THAT THERE WAS NO
MORE WATER AND SHE RESOLUTELY RE ENTERED MONTFERMEIL
HARDLY HAD SHE GONE A HUNDRED PACES WHEN SHE PAUSED AND BEGAN TO SCRATCH
HER HEAD AGAIN
NOW IT WAS THE THENARDIER WHO APPEARED TO HER WITH HER
HIDEOUS HYENA MOUTH AND WRATH FLASHING IN HER EYES
THE CHILD CAST A
MELANCHOLY GLANCE BEFORE HER AND BEHIND HER
WHAT WAS SHE TO DO WHAT
WAS TO BECOME OF HER WHERE WAS SHE TO GO IN FRONT OF HER WAS THE
SPECTRE OF THE THENARDIER BEHIND HER ALL THE PHANTOMS OF THE NIGHT
AND OF THE FOREST
IT WAS BEFORE THE THENARDIER THAT SHE RECOILED
SHE
RESUMED HER PATH TO THE SPRING AND BEGAN TO RUN
SHE EMERGED FROM
THE VILLAGE SHE ENTERED THE FOREST AT A RUN NO LONGER LOOKING AT OR
LISTENING TO ANYTHING
SHE ONLY PAUSED IN HER COURSE WHEN HER BREATH
FAILED HER BUT SHE DID NOT HALT IN HER ADVANCE
SHE WENT STRAIGHT
BEFORE HER IN DESPERATION
AS SHE RAN SHE FELT LIKE CRYING
THE NOCTURNAL QUIVERING OF THE FOREST SURROUNDED HER COMPLETELY
SHE NO LONGER THOUGHT SHE NO LONGER SAW
THE IMMENSITY OF NIGHT WAS
FACING THIS TINY CREATURE
ON THE ONE HAND ALL SHADOW ON THE OTHER AN
ATOM
IT WAS ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES' WALK FROM THE EDGE OF THE WOODS TO
THE SPRING
COSETTE KNEW THE WAY THROUGH HAVING GONE OVER IT MANY TIMES
IN DAYLIGHT
STRANGE TO SAY SHE DID NOT GET LOST
A REMNANT OF INSTINCT
GUIDED HER VAGUELY
BUT SHE DID NOT TURN HER EYES EITHER TO RIGHT OR TO
LEFT FOR FEAR OF SEEING THINGS IN THE BRANCHES AND IN THE BRUSHWOOD
IN
THIS MANNER SHE REACHED THE SPRING
IT WAS A NARROW NATURAL BASIN HOLLOWED OUT BY THE WATER IN A CLAYEY
SOIL ABOUT TWO FEET DEEP SURROUNDED WITH MOSS AND WITH THOSE TALL
CRIMPED GRASSES WHICH ARE CALLED HENRY IV 'S FRILLS AND PAVED WITH
SEVERAL LARGE STONES
A BROOK RAN OUT OF IT WITH A TRANQUIL LITTLE
NOISE
COSETTE DID NOT TAKE TIME TO BREATHE
IT WAS VERY DARK BUT SHE WAS IN
THE HABIT OF COMING TO THIS SPRING
SHE FELT WITH HER LEFT HAND IN THE
DARK FOR A YOUNG OAK WHICH LEANED OVER THE SPRING AND WHICH USUALLY
SERVED TO SUPPORT HER FOUND ONE OF ITS BRANCHES CLUNG TO IT BENT
DOWN AND PLUNGED THE BUCKET IN THE WATER
SHE WAS IN A STATE OF SUCH
VIOLENT EXCITEMENT THAT HER STRENGTH WAS TREBLED
WHILE THUS BENT OVER
SHE DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE POCKET OF HER APRON HAD EMPTIED ITSELF INTO
THE SPRING
THE FIFTEEN SOU PIECE FELL INTO THE WATER
COSETTE NEITHER
SAW NOR HEARD IT FALL
SHE DREW OUT THE BUCKET NEARLY FULL AND SET IT
ON THE GRASS
THAT DONE SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE
SHE WOULD
HAVE LIKED TO SET OUT AGAIN AT ONCE BUT THE EFFORT REQUIRED TO FILL THE
BUCKET HAD BEEN SUCH THAT SHE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A STEP
SHE
WAS FORCED TO SIT DOWN
SHE DROPPED ON THE GRASS AND REMAINED CROUCHING
THERE
SHE SHUT HER EYES THEN SHE OPENED THEM AGAIN WITHOUT KNOWING WHY BUT
BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE
THE AGITATED WATER IN THE BUCKET
BESIDE HER WAS DESCRIBING CIRCLES WHICH RESEMBLED TIN SERPENTS
OVERHEAD THE SKY WAS COVERED WITH VAST BLACK CLOUDS WHICH WERE LIKE
MASSES OF SMOKE
THE TRAGIC MASK OF SHADOW SEEMED TO BEND VAGUELY OVER
THE CHILD
JUPITER WAS SETTING IN THE DEPTHS
THE CHILD STARED WITH BEWILDERED EYES AT THIS GREAT STAR WITH WHICH SHE
WAS UNFAMILIAR AND WHICH TERRIFIED HER
THE PLANET WAS IN FACT VERY
NEAR THE HORIZON AND WAS TRAVERSING A DENSE LAYER OF MIST WHICH IMPARTED
TO IT A HORRIBLE RUDDY HUE
THE MIST GLOOMILY EMPURPLED MAGNIFIED THE
STAR
ONE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT A LUMINOUS WOUND
A COLD WIND WAS BLOWING FROM THE PLAIN
THE FOREST WAS DARK NOT A LEAF
WAS MOVING THERE WERE NONE OF THE VAGUE FRESH GLEAMS OF SUMMERTIDE
GREAT BOUGHS UPLIFTED THEMSELVES IN FRIGHTFUL WISE
SLENDER AND
MISSHAPEN BUSHES WHISTLED IN THE CLEARINGS
THE TALL GRASSES UNDULATED
LIKE EELS UNDER THE NORTH WIND
THE NETTLES SEEMED TO TWIST LONG ARMS
FURNISHED WITH CLAWS IN SEARCH OF PREY
SOME BITS OF DRY HEATHER TOSSED
BY THE BREEZE FLEW RAPIDLY BY AND HAD THE AIR OF FLEEING IN TERROR
BEFORE SOMETHING WHICH WAS COMING AFTER
ON ALL SIDES THERE WERE
LUGUBRIOUS STRETCHES
THE DARKNESS WAS BEWILDERING
MAN REQUIRES LIGHT
WHOEVER BURIES HIMSELF
IN THE OPPOSITE OF DAY FEELS HIS HEART CONTRACT
WHEN THE EYE SEES
BLACK THE HEART SEES TROUBLE
IN AN ECLIPSE IN THE NIGHT IN THE SOOTY
OPACITY THERE IS ANXIETY EVEN FOR THE STOUTEST OF HEARTS
NO ONE WALKS
ALONE IN THE FOREST AT NIGHT WITHOUT TREMBLING
SHADOWS AND TREES TWO
FORMIDABLE DENSITIES
A CHIMERICAL REALITY APPEARS IN THE INDISTINCT
DEPTHS
THE INCONCEIVABLE IS OUTLINED A FEW PACES DISTANT FROM YOU WITH
A SPECTRAL CLEARNESS
ONE BEHOLDS FLOATING EITHER IN SPACE OR IN ONE'S
OWN BRAIN ONE KNOWS NOT WHAT VAGUE AND INTANGIBLE THING LIKE THE
DREAMS OF SLEEPING FLOWERS
THERE ARE FIERCE ATTITUDES ON THE HORIZON
ONE INHALES THE EFFLUVIA OF THE GREAT BLACK VOID
ONE IS AFRAID TO
GLANCE BEHIND HIM YET DESIROUS OF DOING SO
THE CAVITIES OF NIGHT
THINGS GROWN HAGGARD TACITURN PROFILES WHICH VANISH WHEN ONE ADVANCES
OBSCURE DISHEVELMENTS IRRITATED TUFTS LIVID POOLS THE LUGUBRIOUS
REFLECTED IN THE FUNEREAL THE SEPULCHRAL IMMENSITY OF SILENCE UNKNOWN
BUT POSSIBLE BEINGS BENDINGS OF MYSTERIOUS BRANCHES ALARMING TORSOS OF
TREES LONG HANDFULS OF QUIVERING PLANTS AGAINST ALL THIS ONE HAS NO
PROTECTION
THERE IS NO HARDIHOOD WHICH DOES NOT SHUDDER AND WHICH DOES
NOT FEEL THE VICINITY OF ANGUISH
ONE IS CONSCIOUS OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS
AS THOUGH ONE'S SOUL WERE BECOMING AMALGAMATED WITH THE DARKNESS
THIS
PENETRATION OF THE SHADOWS IS INDESCRIBABLY SINISTER IN THE CASE OF A
CHILD
FORESTS ARE APOCALYPSES AND THE BEATING OF THE WINGS OF A TINY SOUL
PRODUCES A SOUND OF AGONY BENEATH THEIR MONSTROUS VAULT
WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HER SENSATIONS COSETTE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS
SEIZED UPON BY THAT BLACK ENORMITY OF NATURE IT WAS NO LONGER TERROR
ALONE WHICH WAS GAINING POSSESSION OF HER IT WAS SOMETHING MORE
TERRIBLE EVEN THAN TERROR SHE SHIVERED
THERE ARE NO WORDS TO EXPRESS
THE STRANGENESS OF THAT SHIVER WHICH CHILLED HER TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF
HER HEART HER EYE GREW WILD SHE THOUGHT SHE FELT THAT SHE SHOULD NOT
BE ABLE TO REFRAIN FROM RETURNING THERE AT THE SAME HOUR ON THE MORROW
THEN BY A SORT OF INSTINCT SHE BEGAN TO COUNT ALOUD ONE TWO THREE
FOUR AND SO ON UP TO TEN IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THAT SINGULAR STATE
WHICH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT WHICH TERRIFIED HER AND WHEN SHE HAD
FINISHED SHE BEGAN AGAIN THIS RESTORED HER TO A TRUE PERCEPTION OF
THE THINGS ABOUT HER
HER HANDS WHICH SHE HAD WET IN DRAWING THE WATER
FELT COLD SHE ROSE HER TERROR A NATURAL AND UNCONQUERABLE TERROR HAD
RETURNED SHE HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT NOW TO FLEE AT FULL SPEED THROUGH
THE FOREST ACROSS THE FIELDS TO THE HOUSES TO THE WINDOWS TO THE
LIGHTED CANDLES
HER GLANCE FELL UPON THE WATER WHICH STOOD BEFORE HER
SUCH WAS THE FRIGHT WHICH THE THENARDIER INSPIRED IN HER THAT SHE DARED
NOT FLEE WITHOUT THAT BUCKET OF WATER SHE SEIZED THE HANDLE WITH BOTH
HANDS SHE COULD HARDLY LIFT THE PAIL
IN THIS MANNER SHE ADVANCED A DOZEN PACES BUT THE BUCKET WAS FULL IT
WAS HEAVY SHE WAS FORCED TO SET IT ON THE GROUND ONCE MORE
SHE TOOK
BREATH FOR AN INSTANT THEN LIFTED THE HANDLE OF THE BUCKET AGAIN AND
RESUMED HER MARCH PROCEEDING A LITTLE FURTHER THIS TIME BUT AGAIN SHE
WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE
AFTER SOME SECONDS OF REPOSE SHE SET OUT AGAIN
SHE WALKED BENT FORWARD WITH DROOPING HEAD LIKE AN OLD WOMAN THE
WEIGHT OF THE BUCKET STRAINED AND STIFFENED HER THIN ARMS
THE IRON
HANDLE COMPLETED THE BENUMBING AND FREEZING OF HER WET AND TINY HANDS
SHE WAS FORCED TO HALT FROM TIME TO TIME AND EACH TIME THAT SHE DID SO
THE COLD WATER WHICH SPLASHED FROM THE PAIL FELL ON HER BARE LEGS
THIS
TOOK PLACE IN THE DEPTHS OF A FOREST AT NIGHT IN WINTER FAR FROM ALL
HUMAN SIGHT SHE WAS A CHILD OF EIGHT NO ONE BUT GOD SAW THAT SAD THING
AT THE MOMENT
AND HER MOTHER NO DOUBT ALAS
FOR THERE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE THE DEAD OPEN THEIR EYES IN THEIR GRAVES
SHE PANTED WITH A SORT OF PAINFUL RATTLE SOBS CONTRACTED HER THROAT
BUT SHE DARED NOT WEEP SO AFRAID WAS SHE OF THE THENARDIER EVEN AT A
DISTANCE IT WAS HER CUSTOM TO IMAGINE THE THENARDIER ALWAYS PRESENT
HOWEVER SHE COULD NOT MAKE MUCH HEADWAY IN THAT MANNER AND SHE WENT
ON VERY SLOWLY
IN SPITE OF DIMINISHING THE LENGTH OF HER STOPS AND
OF WALKING AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BETWEEN THEM SHE REFLECTED WITH ANGUISH
THAT IT WOULD TAKE HER MORE THAN AN HOUR TO RETURN TO MONTFERMEIL IN
THIS MANNER AND THAT THE THENARDIER WOULD BEAT HER
THIS ANGUISH WAS
MINGLED WITH HER TERROR AT BEING ALONE IN THE WOODS AT NIGHT SHE WAS
WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE AND HAD NOT YET EMERGED FROM THE FOREST
ON
ARRIVING NEAR AN OLD CHESTNUT TREE WITH WHICH SHE WAS ACQUAINTED MADE
A LAST HALT LONGER THAN THE REST IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT GET WELL
RESTED THEN SHE SUMMONED UP ALL HER STRENGTH PICKED UP HER BUCKET
AGAIN AND COURAGEOUSLY RESUMED HER MARCH BUT THE POOR LITTLE DESPERATE
CREATURE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM CRYING O MY GOD MY GOD
AT THAT MOMENT SHE SUDDENLY BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT HER BUCKET NO LONGER
WEIGHED ANYTHING AT ALL A HAND WHICH SEEMED TO HER ENORMOUS HAD JUST
SEIZED THE HANDLE AND LIFTED IT VIGOROUSLY
SHE RAISED HER HEAD
A
LARGE BLACK FORM STRAIGHT AND ERECT WAS WALKING BESIDE HER THROUGH THE
DARKNESS IT WAS A MAN WHO HAD COME UP BEHIND HER AND WHOSE APPROACH
SHE HAD NOT HEARD
THIS MAN WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HAD SEIZED THE
HANDLE OF THE BUCKET WHICH SHE WAS CARRYING
THERE ARE INSTINCTS FOR ALL THE ENCOUNTERS OF LIFE
THE CHILD WAS NOT AFRAID
CHAPTER VI WHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUELLE'S INTELLIGENCE
ON THE AFTERNOON OF THAT SAME CHRISTMAS DAY 1823 A MAN HAD WALKED
FOR RATHER A LONG TIME IN THE MOST DESERTED PART OF THE BOULEVARD DE
L'HOPITAL IN PARIS
THIS MAN HAD THE AIR OF A PERSON WHO IS SEEKING
LODGINGS AND HE SEEMED TO HALT BY PREFERENCE AT THE MOST MODEST
HOUSES ON THAT DILAPIDATED BORDER OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT MARCEAU
WE SHALL SEE FURTHER ON THAT THIS MAN HAD IN FACT HIRED A CHAMBER IN
THAT ISOLATED QUARTER
THIS MAN IN HIS ATTIRE AS IN ALL HIS PERSON REALIZED THE TYPE OF WHAT
MAY BE CALLED THE WELL BRED MENDICANT EXTREME WRETCHEDNESS COMBINED
WITH EXTREME CLEANLINESS
THIS IS A VERY RARE MIXTURE WHICH INSPIRES
INTELLIGENT HEARTS WITH THAT DOUBLE RESPECT WHICH ONE FEELS FOR THE MAN
WHO IS VERY POOR AND FOR THE MAN WHO IS VERY WORTHY
HE WORE A VERY
OLD AND VERY WELL BRUSHED ROUND HAT A COARSE COAT WORN PERFECTLY
THREADBARE OF AN OCHRE YELLOW A COLOR THAT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST
ECCENTRIC AT THAT EPOCH A LARGE WAISTCOAT WITH POCKETS OF A VENERABLE
CUT BLACK BREECHES WORN GRAY AT THE KNEE STOCKINGS OF BLACK WORSTED
AND THICK SHOES WITH COPPER BUCKLES
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PRONOUNCED A
PRECEPTOR IN SOME GOOD FAMILY RETURNED FROM THE EMIGRATION
HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS OF AGE FROM HIS PERFECTLY
WHITE HAIR HIS WRINKLED BROW HIS LIVID LIPS AND HIS COUNTENANCE
WHERE EVERYTHING BREATHED DEPRESSION AND WEARINESS OF LIFE
JUDGING FROM
HIS FIRM TREAD FROM THE SINGULAR VIGOR WHICH STAMPED ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
HE WOULD HAVE HARDLY BEEN THOUGHT FIFTY
THE WRINKLES ON HIS BROW WERE
WELL PLACED AND WOULD HAVE DISPOSED IN HIS FAVOR ANY ONE WHO OBSERVED
HIM ATTENTIVELY
HIS LIP CONTRACTED WITH A STRANGE FOLD WHICH SEEMED
SEVERE AND WHICH WAS HUMBLE
THERE WAS IN THE DEPTH OF HIS GLANCE AN
INDESCRIBABLE MELANCHOLY SERENITY
IN HIS LEFT HAND HE CARRIED A LITTLE
BUNDLE TIED UP IN A HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS RIGHT HE LEANED ON A SORT OF A
CUDGEL CUT FROM SOME HEDGE
THIS STICK HAD BEEN CAREFULLY TRIMMED AND
HAD AN AIR THAT WAS NOT TOO THREATENING THE MOST HAD BEEN MADE OF ITS
KNOTS AND IT HAD RECEIVED A CORAL LIKE HEAD MADE FROM RED WAX IT WAS
A CUDGEL AND IT SEEMED TO BE A CANE
THERE ARE BUT FEW PASSERS BY ON THAT BOULEVARD PARTICULARLY IN THE
WINTER
THE MAN SEEMED TO AVOID THEM RATHER THAN TO SEEK THEM BUT THIS
WITHOUT ANY AFFECTATION
AT THAT EPOCH KING LOUIS XVIII
WENT NEARLY EVERY DAY TO CHOISY LE ROI
IT WAS ONE OF HIS FAVORITE EXCURSIONS
TOWARDS TWO O'CLOCK ALMOST
INVARIABLY THE ROYAL CARRIAGE AND CAVALCADE WAS SEEN TO PASS AT FULL
SPEED ALONG THE BOULEVARD DE L'HOPITAL
THIS SERVED IN LIEU OF A WATCH OR CLOCK TO THE POOR WOMEN OF THE QUARTER
WHO SAID IT IS TWO O'CLOCK THERE HE IS RETURNING TO THE TUILERIES
AND SOME RUSHED FORWARD AND OTHERS DREW UP IN LINE FOR A PASSING KING
ALWAYS CREATES A TUMULT BESIDES THE APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF
LOUIS XVIII
PRODUCED A CERTAIN EFFECT IN THE STREETS OF PARIS
IT WAS
RAPID BUT MAJESTIC
THIS IMPOTENT KING HAD A TASTE FOR A FAST GALLOP
AS HE WAS NOT ABLE TO WALK HE WISHED TO RUN THAT CRIPPLE WOULD GLADLY
HAVE HAD HIMSELF DRAWN BY THE LIGHTNING
HE PASSED PACIFIC AND SEVERE
IN THE MIDST OF NAKED SWORDS
HIS MASSIVE COACH ALL COVERED WITH
GILDING WITH GREAT BRANCHES OF LILIES PAINTED ON THE PANELS THUNDERED
NOISILY ALONG
THERE WAS HARDLY TIME TO CAST A GLANCE UPON IT
IN THE
REAR ANGLE ON THE RIGHT THERE WAS VISIBLE ON TUFTED CUSHIONS OF WHITE
SATIN A LARGE FIRM AND RUDDY FACE A BROW FRESHLY POWDERED A L'OISEAU
ROYAL A PROUD HARD CRAFTY EYE THE SMILE OF AN EDUCATED MAN TWO
GREAT EPAULETS WITH BULLION FRINGE FLOATING OVER A BOURGEOIS COAT THE
GOLDEN FLEECE THE CROSS OF SAINT LOUIS THE CROSS OF THE LEGION OF
HONOR THE SILVER PLAQUE OF THE SAINT ESPRIT A HUGE BELLY AND A WIDE
BLUE RIBBON IT WAS THE KING
OUTSIDE OF PARIS HE HELD HIS HAT DECKED
WITH WHITE OSTRICH PLUMES ON HIS KNEES ENWRAPPED IN HIGH ENGLISH
GAITERS WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CITY HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND SALUTED
RARELY HE STARED COLDLY AT THE PEOPLE AND THEY RETURNED IT IN KIND
WHEN HE APPEARED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE SAINT MARCEAU QUARTER
THE WHOLE SUCCESS WHICH HE PRODUCED IS CONTAINED IN THIS REMARK OF AN
INHABITANT OF THE FAUBOURG TO HIS COMRADE THAT BIG FELLOW YONDER IS
THE GOVERNMENT
THIS INFALLIBLE PASSAGE OF THE KING AT THE SAME HOUR WAS THEREFORE THE
DAILY EVENT OF THE BOULEVARD DE L'HOPITAL
THE PROMENADER IN THE YELLOW COAT EVIDENTLY DID NOT BELONG IN THE
QUARTER AND PROBABLY DID NOT BELONG IN PARIS FOR HE WAS IGNORANT AS TO
THIS DETAIL
WHEN AT TWO O'CLOCK THE ROYAL CARRIAGE SURROUNDED BY A
SQUADRON OF THE BODY GUARD ALL COVERED WITH SILVER LACE DEBOUCHED
ON THE BOULEVARD AFTER HAVING MADE THE TURN OF THE SALPETRIERE HE
APPEARED SURPRISED AND ALMOST ALARMED
THERE WAS NO ONE BUT HIMSELF IN
THIS CROSS LANE
HE DREW UP HASTILY BEHIND THE CORNER OF THE WALL OF AN
ENCLOSURE THOUGH THIS DID NOT PREVENT M
LE DUC DE HAVRE FROM SPYING
HIM OUT
M
LE DUC DE HAVRE AS CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD ON DUTY THAT DAY WAS SEATED
IN THE CARRIAGE OPPOSITE THE KING
HE SAID TO HIS MAJESTY YONDER
IS AN EVIL LOOKING MAN MEMBERS OF THE POLICE WHO WERE CLEARING THE
KING'S ROUTE TOOK EQUAL NOTE OF HIM ONE OF THEM RECEIVED AN ORDER TO
FOLLOW HIM
BUT THE MAN PLUNGED INTO THE DESERTED LITTLE STREETS OF THE
FAUBOURG AND AS TWILIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO FALL THE AGENT LOST TRACE OF
HIM AS IS STATED IN A REPORT ADDRESSED THAT SAME EVENING TO M
LE COMTE
D'ANGLES MINISTER OF STATE PREFECT OF POLICE
WHEN THE MAN IN THE YELLOW COAT HAD THROWN THE AGENT OFF HIS TRACK
HE REDOUBLED HIS PACE NOT WITHOUT TURNING ROUND MANY A TIME TO ASSURE
HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT BEING FOLLOWED
AT A QUARTER PAST FOUR THAT IS
TO SAY WHEN NIGHT WAS FULLY COME HE PASSED IN FRONT OF THE THEATRE
OF THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN WHERE THE TWO CONVICTS WAS BEING PLAYED THAT
DAY
THIS POSTER ILLUMINATED BY THE THEATRE LANTERNS STRUCK HIM FOR
ALTHOUGH HE WAS WALKING RAPIDLY HE HALTED TO READ IT
AN INSTANT LATER
HE WAS IN THE BLIND ALLEY OF LA PLANCHETTE AND HE ENTERED THE PLAT
D'ETAIN THE PEWTER PLATTER WHERE THE OFFICE OF THE COACH FOR LAGNY
WAS THEN SITUATED
THIS COACH SET OUT AT HALF PAST FOUR
THE HORSES WERE
HARNESSED AND THE TRAVELLERS SUMMONED BY THE COACHMAN WERE HASTILY
CLIMBING THE LOFTY IRON LADDER OF THE VEHICLE
THE MAN INQUIRED
HAVE YOU A PLACE
ONLY ONE BESIDE ME ON THE BOX SAID THE COACHMAN
I WILL TAKE IT
CLIMB UP
NEVERTHELESS BEFORE SETTING OUT THE COACHMAN CAST A GLANCE AT THE
TRAVELLER'S SHABBY DRESS AT THE DIMINUTIVE SIZE OF HIS BUNDLE AND MADE
HIM PAY HIS FARE
ARE YOU GOING AS FAR AS LAGNY DEMANDED THE COACHMAN
YES SAID THE MAN
THE TRAVELLER PAID TO LAGNY
THEY STARTED
WHEN THEY HAD PASSED THE BARRIER THE COACHMAN TRIED
TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION BUT THE TRAVELLER ONLY REPLIED IN
MONOSYLLABLES
THE COACHMAN TOOK TO WHISTLING AND SWEARING AT HIS
HORSES
THE COACHMAN WRAPPED HIMSELF UP IN HIS CLOAK
IT WAS COLD
THE MAN
DID NOT APPEAR TO BE THINKING OF THAT
THUS THEY PASSED GOURNAY AND
NEUILLY SUR MARNE
TOWARDS SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THEY REACHED CHELLES
THE COACHMAN
DREW UP IN FRONT OF THE CARTERS' INN INSTALLED IN THE ANCIENT BUILDINGS
OF THE ROYAL ABBEY TO GIVE HIS HORSES A BREATHING SPELL
I GET DOWN HERE SAID THE MAN
HE TOOK HIS BUNDLE AND HIS CUDGEL AND JUMPED DOWN FROM THE VEHICLE
AN INSTANT LATER HE HAD DISAPPEARED
HE DID NOT ENTER THE INN
WHEN THE COACH SET OUT FOR LAGNY A FEW MINUTES LATER IT DID NOT
ENCOUNTER HIM IN THE PRINCIPAL STREET OF CHELLES
THE COACHMAN TURNED TO THE INSIDE TRAVELLERS
THERE SAID HE IS A MAN WHO DOES NOT BELONG HERE FOR I DO NOT KNOW
HIM
HE HAD NOT THE AIR OF OWNING A SOU BUT HE DOES NOT CONSIDER MONEY
HE PAYS TO LAGNY AND HE GOES ONLY AS FAR AS CHELLES
IT IS NIGHT ALL
THE HOUSES ARE SHUT HE DOES NOT ENTER THE INN AND HE IS NOT TO BE
FOUND
SO HE HAS DIVED THROUGH THE EARTH
THE MAN HAD NOT PLUNGED INTO THE EARTH BUT HE HAD GONE WITH GREAT
STRIDES THROUGH THE DARK DOWN THE PRINCIPAL STREET OF CHELLES THEN HE
HAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT BEFORE REACHING THE CHURCH INTO THE CROSS ROAD
LEADING TO MONTFERMEIL LIKE A PERSON WHO WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE
COUNTRY AND HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE
HE FOLLOWED THIS ROAD RAPIDLY
AT THE SPOT WHERE IT IS INTERSECTED BY
THE ANCIENT TREE BORDERED ROAD WHICH RUNS FROM GAGNY TO LAGNY HE HEARD
PEOPLE COMING
HE CONCEALED HIMSELF PRECIPITATELY IN A DITCH AND THERE
WAITED UNTIL THE PASSERS BY WERE AT A DISTANCE
THE PRECAUTION WAS
NEARLY SUPERFLUOUS HOWEVER FOR AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID IT WAS A VERY
DARK DECEMBER NIGHT
NOT MORE THAN TWO OR THREE STARS WERE VISIBLE IN
THE SKY
IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT THE ASCENT OF THE HILL BEGINS
THE MAN DID NOT
RETURN TO THE ROAD TO MONTFERMEIL HE STRUCK ACROSS THE FIELDS TO THE
RIGHT AND ENTERED THE FOREST WITH LONG STRIDES
ONCE IN THE FOREST HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND BEGAN A CAREFUL
EXAMINATION OF ALL THE TREES ADVANCING STEP BY STEP AS THOUGH SEEKING
AND FOLLOWING A MYSTERIOUS ROAD KNOWN TO HIMSELF ALONE
THERE CAME A
MOMENT WHEN HE APPEARED TO LOSE HIMSELF AND HE PAUSED IN INDECISION
AT
LAST HE ARRIVED BY DINT OF FEELING HIS WAY INCH BY INCH AT A CLEARING
WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT HEAP OF WHITISH STONES
HE STEPPED UP BRISKLY TO
THESE STONES AND EXAMINED THEM ATTENTIVELY THROUGH THE MISTS OF NIGHT
AS THOUGH HE WERE PASSING THEM IN REVIEW
A LARGE TREE COVERED WITH
THOSE EXCRESCENCES WHICH ARE THE WARTS OF VEGETATION STOOD A FEW PACES
DISTANT FROM THE PILE OF STONES
HE WENT UP TO THIS TREE AND PASSED
HIS HAND OVER THE BARK OF THE TRUNK AS THOUGH SEEKING TO RECOGNIZE AND
COUNT ALL THE WARTS
OPPOSITE THIS TREE WHICH WAS AN ASH THERE WAS A CHESTNUT TREE
SUFFERING FROM A PEELING OF THE BARK TO WHICH A BAND OF ZINC HAD BEEN
NAILED BY WAY OF DRESSING
HE RAISED HIMSELF ON TIPTOE AND TOUCHED THIS
BAND OF ZINC
THEN HE TROD ABOUT FOR AWHILE ON THE GROUND COMPRISED IN THE SPACE
BETWEEN THE TREE AND THE HEAP OF STONES LIKE A PERSON WHO IS TRYING TO
ASSURE HIMSELF THAT THE SOIL HAS NOT RECENTLY BEEN DISTURBED
THAT DONE HE TOOK HIS BEARINGS AND RESUMED HIS MARCH THROUGH THE
FOREST
IT WAS THE MAN WHO HAD JUST MET COSETTE
AS HE WALKED THROUGH THE THICKET IN THE DIRECTION OF MONTFERMEIL HE HAD
ESPIED THAT TINY SHADOW MOVING WITH A GROAN DEPOSITING A BURDEN ON
THE GROUND THEN TAKING IT UP AND SETTING OUT AGAIN
HE DREW NEAR AND
PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS A VERY YOUNG CHILD LADEN WITH AN ENORMOUS BUCKET
OF WATER
THEN HE APPROACHED THE CHILD AND SILENTLY GRASPED THE HANDLE
OF THE BUCKET
CHAPTER VII COSETTE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE STRANGER IN THE DARK
COSETTE AS WE HAVE SAID WAS NOT FRIGHTENED
THE MAN ACCOSTED HER
HE SPOKE IN A VOICE THAT WAS GRAVE AND ALMOST
BASS
MY CHILD WHAT YOU ARE CARRYING IS VERY HEAVY FOR YOU
COSETTE RAISED HER HEAD AND REPLIED
YES SIR
GIVE IT TO ME SAID THE MAN I WILL CARRY IT FOR YOU
COSETTE LET GO OF THE BUCKET HANDLE
THE MAN WALKED ALONG BESIDE HER
IT REALLY IS VERY HEAVY HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
THEN HE
ADDED
HOW OLD ARE YOU LITTLE ONE
EIGHT SIR
AND HAVE YOU COME FROM FAR LIKE THIS
FROM THE SPRING IN THE FOREST
ARE YOU GOING FAR
A GOOD QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S WALK FROM HERE
THE MAN SAID NOTHING FOR A MOMENT THEN HE REMARKED ABRUPTLY
SO YOU HAVE NO MOTHER
I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED THE CHILD
BEFORE THE MAN HAD TIME TO SPEAK AGAIN SHE ADDED
I DON'T THINK SO
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MOTHERS
I HAVE NONE
AND AFTER A SILENCE SHE WENT ON
I THINK THAT I NEVER HAD ANY
THE MAN HALTED HE SET THE BUCKET ON THE GROUND BENT DOWN AND PLACED
BOTH HANDS ON THE CHILD'S SHOULDERS MAKING AN EFFORT TO LOOK AT HER AND
TO SEE HER FACE IN THE DARK
COSETTE'S THIN AND SICKLY FACE WAS VAGUELY OUTLINED BY THE LIVID LIGHT
IN THE SKY
WHAT IS YOUR NAME SAID THE MAN
COSETTE
THE MAN SEEMED TO HAVE RECEIVED AN ELECTRIC SHOCK
HE LOOKED AT HER ONCE
MORE THEN HE REMOVED HIS HANDS FROM COSETTE'S SHOULDERS SEIZED THE
BUCKET AND SET OUT AGAIN
AFTER A MOMENT HE INQUIRED
WHERE DO YOU LIVE LITTLE ONE
AT MONTFERMEIL IF YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS
THAT IS WHERE WE ARE GOING
YES SIR
HE PAUSED THEN BEGAN AGAIN
WHO SENT YOU AT SUCH AN HOUR TO GET WATER IN THE FOREST
IT WAS MADAME THENARDIER
THE MAN RESUMED IN A VOICE WHICH HE STROVE TO RENDER INDIFFERENT BUT
IN WHICH THERE WAS NEVERTHELESS A SINGULAR TREMOR
WHAT DOES YOUR MADAME THENARDIER DO
SHE IS MY MISTRESS SAID THE CHILD
SHE KEEPS THE INN
THE INN SAID THE MAN
WELL I AM GOING TO LODGE THERE TO NIGHT
SHOW
ME THE WAY
WE ARE ON THE WAY THERE SAID THE CHILD
THE MAN WALKED TOLERABLY FAST
COSETTE FOLLOWED HIM WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
SHE NO LONGER FELT ANY FATIGUE
FROM TIME TO TIME SHE RAISED HER EYES
TOWARDS THE MAN WITH A SORT OF TRANQUILLITY AND AN INDESCRIBABLE
CONFIDENCE
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO TURN TO PROVIDENCE AND TO PRAY
NEVERTHELESS SHE FELT WITHIN HER SOMETHING WHICH RESEMBLED HOPE AND
JOY AND WHICH MOUNTED TOWARDS HEAVEN
SEVERAL MINUTES ELAPSED
THE MAN RESUMED
IS THERE NO SERVANT IN MADAME THENARDIER'S HOUSE
NO SIR
ARE YOU ALONE THERE
YES SIR
ANOTHER PAUSE ENSUED
COSETTE LIFTED UP HER VOICE
THAT IS TO SAY THERE ARE TWO LITTLE GIRLS
WHAT LITTLE GIRLS
PONINE AND ZELMA
THIS WAS THE WAY THE CHILD SIMPLIFIED THE ROMANTIC NAMES SO DEAR TO THE
FEMALE THENARDIER
WHO ARE PONINE AND ZELMA
THEY ARE MADAME THENARDIER'S YOUNG LADIES HER DAUGHTERS AS YOU WOULD
SAY
AND WHAT DO THOSE GIRLS DO
OH SAID THE CHILD THEY HAVE BEAUTIFUL DOLLS THINGS WITH GOLD IN
THEM ALL FULL OF AFFAIRS
THEY PLAY THEY AMUSE THEMSELVES
ALL DAY LONG
YES SIR
AND YOU
I I WORK
ALL DAY LONG
THE CHILD RAISED HER GREAT EYES IN WHICH HUNG A TEAR WHICH WAS NOT
VISIBLE BECAUSE OF THE DARKNESS AND REPLIED GENTLY
YES SIR
AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SILENCE SHE WENT ON
SOMETIMES WHEN I HAVE FINISHED MY WORK AND THEY LET ME I AMUSE
MYSELF TOO
HOW DO YOU AMUSE YOURSELF
IN THE BEST WAY I CAN
THEY LET ME ALONE BUT I HAVE NOT MANY
PLAYTHINGS
PONINE AND ZELMA WILL NOT LET ME PLAY WITH THEIR DOLLS
I
HAVE ONLY A LITTLE LEAD SWORD NO LONGER THAN THAT
THE CHILD HELD UP HER TINY FINGER
AND IT WILL NOT CUT
YES SIR SAID THE CHILD IT CUTS SALAD AND THE HEADS OF FLIES
THEY REACHED THE VILLAGE
COSETTE GUIDED THE STRANGER THROUGH THE
STREETS
THEY PASSED THE BAKESHOP BUT COSETTE DID NOT THINK OF THE
BREAD WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO FETCH
THE MAN HAD CEASED TO PLY HER
WITH QUESTIONS AND NOW PRESERVED A GLOOMY SILENCE
WHEN THEY HAD LEFT THE CHURCH BEHIND THEM THE MAN ON PERCEIVING ALL
THE OPEN AIR BOOTHS ASKED COSETTE
SO THERE IS A FAIR GOING ON HERE
NO SIR IT IS CHRISTMAS
AS THEY APPROACHED THE TAVERN COSETTE TIMIDLY TOUCHED HIS ARM
MONSIEUR
WHAT MY CHILD
WE ARE QUITE NEAR THE HOUSE
WELL
WILL YOU LET ME TAKE MY BUCKET NOW
WHY
IF MADAME SEES THAT SOME ONE HAS CARRIED IT FOR ME SHE WILL BEAT ME
THE MAN HANDED HER THE BUCKET
AN INSTANT LATER THEY WERE AT THE TAVERN
DOOR
CHAPTER VIII THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF RECEIVING INTO ONE'S HOUSE A POOR
MAN WHO MAY BE A RICH MAN
COSETTE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM CASTING A SIDELONG GLANCE AT THE BIG
DOLL WHICH WAS STILL DISPLAYED AT THE TOY MERCHANT'S THEN SHE KNOCKED
THE DOOR OPENED
THE THENARDIER APPEARED WITH A CANDLE IN HER HAND
AH SO IT'S YOU YOU LITTLE WRETCH GOOD MERCY BUT YOU'VE TAKEN YOUR
TIME THE HUSSY HAS BEEN AMUSING HERSELF
MADAME SAID COSETTE TREMBLING ALL OVER HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO
WANTS A LODGING
THE THENARDIER SPEEDILY REPLACED HER GRUFF AIR BY HER AMIABLE GRIMACE
A CHANGE OF ASPECT COMMON TO TAVERN KEEPERS AND EAGERLY SOUGHT THE
NEW COMER WITH HER EYES
THIS IS THE GENTLEMAN SAID SHE
YES MADAME REPLIED THE MAN RAISING HIS HAND TO HIS HAT
WEALTHY TRAVELLERS ARE NOT SO POLITE
THIS GESTURE AND AN INSPECTION
OF THE STRANGER'S COSTUME AND BAGGAGE WHICH THE THENARDIER PASSED IN
REVIEW WITH ONE GLANCE CAUSED THE AMIABLE GRIMACE TO VANISH AND THE
GRUFF MIEN TO REAPPEAR
SHE RESUMED DRYLY
ENTER MY GOOD MAN
THE GOOD MAN ENTERED
THE THENARDIER CAST A SECOND GLANCE AT HIM PAID
PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO HIS FROCK COAT WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY THREADBARE
AND TO HIS HAT WHICH WAS A LITTLE BATTERED AND TOSSING HER HEAD
WRINKLING HER NOSE AND SCREWING UP HER EYES SHE CONSULTED HER HUSBAND
WHO WAS STILL DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS
THE HUSBAND REPLIED BY THAT
IMPERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT OF THE FOREFINGER WHICH BACKED UP BY AN
INFLATION OF THE LIPS SIGNIFIES IN SUCH CASES A REGULAR BEGGAR
THEREUPON THE THENARDIER EXCLAIMED
AH SEE HERE MY GOOD MAN I AM VERY SORRY BUT I HAVE NO ROOM LEFT
PUT ME WHERE YOU LIKE SAID THE MAN IN THE ATTIC IN THE STABLE
I
WILL PAY AS THOUGH I OCCUPIED A ROOM
FORTY SOUS
FORTY SOUS AGREED
VERY WELL THEN
FORTY SOUS SAID A CARTER IN A LOW TONE TO THE THENARDIER WOMAN
WHY THE CHARGE IS ONLY TWENTY SOUS
IT IS FORTY IN HIS CASE RETORTED THE THENARDIER IN THE SAME TONE
I
DON'T LODGE POOR FOLKS FOR LESS
THAT'S TRUE ADDED HER HUSBAND GENTLY IT RUINS A HOUSE TO HAVE SUCH
PEOPLE IN IT
IN THE MEANTIME THE MAN LAYING HIS BUNDLE AND HIS CUDGEL ON A BENCH
HAD SEATED HIMSELF AT A TABLE ON WHICH COSETTE MADE HASTE TO PLACE A
BOTTLE OF WINE AND A GLASS
THE MERCHANT WHO HAD DEMANDED THE BUCKET OF
WATER TOOK IT TO HIS HORSE HIMSELF
COSETTE RESUMED HER PLACE UNDER THE
KITCHEN TABLE AND HER KNITTING
THE MAN WHO HAD BARELY MOISTENED HIS LIPS IN THE WINE WHICH HE HAD
POURED OUT FOR HIMSELF OBSERVED THE CHILD WITH PECULIAR ATTENTION
COSETTE WAS UGLY
IF SHE HAD BEEN HAPPY SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PRETTY
WE
HAVE ALREADY GIVEN A SKETCH OF THAT SOMBRE LITTLE FIGURE
COSETTE WAS
THIN AND PALE SHE WAS NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OLD BUT SHE SEEMED TO BE
HARDLY SIX
HER LARGE EYES SUNKEN IN A SORT OF SHADOW WERE ALMOST PUT
OUT WITH WEEPING
THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH HAD THAT CURVE OF HABITUAL
ANGUISH WHICH IS SEEN IN CONDEMNED PERSONS AND DESPERATELY SICK PEOPLE
HER HANDS WERE AS HER MOTHER HAD DIVINED RUINED WITH CHILBLAINS THE
FIRE WHICH ILLUMINATED HER AT THAT MOMENT BROUGHT INTO RELIEF ALL THE
ANGLES OF HER BONES AND RENDERED HER THINNESS FRIGHTFULLY APPARENT
AS SHE WAS ALWAYS SHIVERING SHE HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF PRESSING HER
KNEES ONE AGAINST THE OTHER
HER ENTIRE CLOTHING WAS BUT A RAG WHICH
WOULD HAVE INSPIRED PITY IN SUMMER AND WHICH INSPIRED HORROR IN WINTER
ALL SHE HAD ON WAS HOLE RIDDEN LINEN NOT A SCRAP OF WOOLLEN
HER SKIN
WAS VISIBLE HERE AND THERE AND EVERYWHERE BLACK AND BLUE SPOTS COULD BE
DESCRIED WHICH MARKED THE PLACES WHERE THE THENARDIER WOMAN HAD TOUCHED
HER
HER NAKED LEGS WERE THIN AND RED
THE HOLLOWS IN HER NECK WERE
ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE WEEP
THIS CHILD'S WHOLE PERSON HER MIEN HER
ATTITUDE THE SOUND OF HER VOICE THE INTERVALS WHICH SHE ALLOWED TO
ELAPSE BETWEEN ONE WORD AND THE NEXT HER GLANCE HER SILENCE HER
SLIGHTEST GESTURE EXPRESSED AND BETRAYED ONE SOLE IDEA FEAR
FEAR WAS DIFFUSED ALL OVER HER SHE WAS COVERED WITH IT SO TO SPEAK
FEAR DREW HER ELBOWS CLOSE TO HER HIPS WITHDREW HER HEELS UNDER HER
PETTICOAT MADE HER OCCUPY AS LITTLE SPACE AS POSSIBLE ALLOWED HER ONLY
THE BREATH THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND HAD BECOME WHAT MIGHT BE
CALLED THE HABIT OF HER BODY ADMITTING OF NO POSSIBLE VARIATION EXCEPT
AN INCREASE
IN THE DEPTHS OF HER EYES THERE WAS AN ASTONISHED NOOK
WHERE TERROR LURKED
HER FEAR WAS SUCH THAT ON HER ARRIVAL WET AS SHE WAS COSETTE DID NOT
DARE TO APPROACH THE FIRE AND DRY HERSELF BUT SAT SILENTLY DOWN TO HER
WORK AGAIN
THE EXPRESSION IN THE GLANCE OF THAT CHILD OF EIGHT YEARS WAS HABITUALLY
SO GLOOMY AND AT TIMES SO TRAGIC THAT IT SEEMED AT CERTAIN MOMENTS AS
THOUGH SHE WERE ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING AN IDIOT OR A DEMON
AS WE HAVE STATED SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT IT IS TO PRAY SHE HAD NEVER
SET FOOT IN A CHURCH
HAVE I THE TIME SAID THE THENARDIER
THE MAN IN THE YELLOW COAT NEVER TOOK HIS EYES FROM COSETTE
ALL AT ONCE THE THENARDIER EXCLAIMED
BY THE WAY WHERE'S THAT BREAD
COSETTE ACCORDING TO HER CUSTOM WHENEVER THE THENARDIER UPLIFTED HER
VOICE EMERGED WITH GREAT HASTE FROM BENEATH THE TABLE
SHE HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN THE BREAD
SHE HAD RECOURSE TO THE
EXPEDIENT OF CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN A CONSTANT STATE OF FEAR
SHE LIED
MADAME THE BAKER'S SHOP WAS SHUT
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED
I DID KNOCK MADAME
WELL
HE DID NOT OPEN THE DOOR
I'LL FIND OUT TO MORROW WHETHER THAT IS TRUE SAID THE THENARDIER
AND IF YOU ARE TELLING ME A LIE I'LL LEAD YOU A PRETTY DANCE
IN THE
MEANTIME GIVE ME BACK MY FIFTEEN SOU PIECE
COSETTE PLUNGED HER HAND INTO THE POCKET OF HER APRON AND TURNED GREEN
THE FIFTEEN SOU PIECE WAS NOT THERE
AH COME NOW SAID MADAME THENARDIER DID YOU HEAR ME
COSETTE TURNED HER POCKET INSIDE OUT THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT
WHAT
COULD HAVE BECOME OF THAT MONEY THE UNHAPPY LITTLE CREATURE COULD NOT
FIND A WORD TO SAY
SHE WAS PETRIFIED
HAVE YOU LOST THAT FIFTEEN SOU PIECE SCREAMED THE THENARDIER
HOARSELY OR DO YOU WANT TO ROB ME OF IT
AT THE SAME TIME SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARM TOWARDS THE
CAT O' NINE TAILS WHICH HUNG ON A NAIL IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER
THIS FORMIDABLE GESTURE RESTORED TO COSETTE SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO
SHRIEK
MERCY MADAME MADAME I WILL NOT DO SO ANY MORE
THE THENARDIER TOOK DOWN THE WHIP
IN THE MEANTIME THE MAN IN THE YELLOW COAT HAD BEEN FUMBLING IN THE FOB
OF HIS WAISTCOAT WITHOUT ANY ONE HAVING NOTICED HIS MOVEMENTS
BESIDES
THE OTHER TRAVELLERS WERE DRINKING OR PLAYING CARDS AND WERE NOT PAYING
ATTENTION TO ANYTHING
COSETTE CONTRACTED HERSELF INTO A BALL WITH ANGUISH WITHIN THE ANGLE
OF THE CHIMNEY ENDEAVORING TO GATHER UP AND CONCEAL HER POOR HALF NUDE
LIMBS
THE THENARDIER RAISED HER ARM
PARDON ME MADAME SAID THE MAN BUT JUST NOW I CAUGHT SIGHT OF
SOMETHING WHICH HAD FALLEN FROM THIS LITTLE ONE'S APRON POCKET AND
ROLLED ASIDE
PERHAPS THIS IS IT
AT THE SAME TIME HE BENT DOWN AND SEEMED TO BE SEARCHING ON THE FLOOR
FOR A MOMENT
EXACTLY HERE IT IS HE WENT ON STRAIGHTENING HIMSELF UP
AND HE HELD OUT A SILVER COIN TO THE THENARDIER
YES THAT'S IT SAID SHE
IT WAS NOT IT FOR IT WAS A TWENTY SOU PIECE BUT THE THENARDIER FOUND
IT TO HER ADVANTAGE
SHE PUT THE COIN IN HER POCKET AND CONFINED
HERSELF TO CASTING A FIERCE GLANCE AT THE CHILD ACCOMPANIED WITH THE
REMARK DON'T LET THIS EVER HAPPEN AGAIN
COSETTE RETURNED TO WHAT THE THENARDIER CALLED HER KENNEL AND HER
LARGE EYES WHICH WERE RIVETED ON THE TRAVELLER BEGAN TO TAKE ON AN
EXPRESSION SUCH AS THEY HAD NEVER WORN BEFORE
THUS FAR IT WAS ONLY AN
INNOCENT AMAZEMENT BUT A SORT OF STUPEFIED CONFIDENCE WAS MINGLED WITH
IT
BY THE WAY WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SUPPER THE THENARDIER INQUIRED OF THE
TRAVELLER
HE MADE NO REPLY
HE APPEARED TO BE ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
WHAT SORT OF A MAN IS THAT SHE MUTTERED BETWEEN HER TEETH
HE'S SOME
FRIGHTFULLY POOR WRETCH
HE HASN'T A SOU TO PAY FOR A SUPPER
WILL HE
EVEN PAY ME FOR HIS LODGING IT'S VERY LUCKY ALL THE SAME THAT IT DID
NOT OCCUR TO HIM TO STEAL THE MONEY THAT WAS ON THE FLOOR
IN THE MEANTIME A DOOR HAD OPENED AND EPONINE AND AZELMA ENTERED
THEY WERE TWO REALLY PRETTY LITTLE GIRLS MORE BOURGEOIS THAN PEASANT
IN LOOKS AND VERY CHARMING THE ONE WITH SHINING CHESTNUT TRESSES
THE OTHER WITH LONG BLACK BRAIDS HANGING DOWN HER BACK BOTH VIVACIOUS
NEAT PLUMP ROSY AND HEALTHY AND A DELIGHT TO THE EYE
THEY WERE
WARMLY CLAD BUT WITH SO MUCH MATERNAL ART THAT THE THICKNESS OF THE
STUFFS DID NOT DETRACT FROM THE COQUETRY OF ARRANGEMENT
THERE WAS A
HINT OF WINTER THOUGH THE SPRINGTIME WAS NOT WHOLLY EFFACED
LIGHT
EMANATED FROM THESE TWO LITTLE BEINGS
BESIDES THIS THEY WERE ON THE
THRONE
IN THEIR TOILETTES IN THEIR GAYETY IN THE NOISE WHICH THEY
MADE THERE WAS SOVEREIGNTY
WHEN THEY ENTERED THE THENARDIER SAID TO
THEM IN A GRUMBLING TONE WHICH WAS FULL OF ADORATION AH THERE YOU
ARE YOU CHILDREN
THEN DRAWING THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER TO HER KNEES SMOOTHING THEIR
HAIR TYING THEIR RIBBONS AFRESH AND THEN RELEASING THEM WITH
THAT GENTLE MANNER OF SHAKING OFF WHICH IS PECULIAR TO MOTHERS SHE
EXCLAIMED WHAT FRIGHTS THEY ARE
THEY WENT AND SEATED THEMSELVES IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER
THEY HAD A DOLL
WHICH THEY TURNED OVER AND OVER ON THEIR KNEES WITH ALL SORTS OF JOYOUS
CHATTER
FROM TIME TO TIME COSETTE RAISED HER EYES FROM HER KNITTING
AND WATCHED THEIR PLAY WITH A MELANCHOLY AIR
EPONINE AND AZELMA DID NOT LOOK AT COSETTE
SHE WAS THE SAME AS A DOG
TO THEM
THESE THREE LITTLE GIRLS DID NOT YET RECKON UP FOUR AND TWENTY
YEARS BETWEEN THEM BUT THEY ALREADY REPRESENTED THE WHOLE SOCIETY OF
MAN ENVY ON THE ONE SIDE DISDAIN ON THE OTHER
THE DOLL OF THE THENARDIER SISTERS WAS VERY MUCH FADED VERY OLD AND
MUCH BROKEN BUT IT SEEMED NONE THE LESS ADMIRABLE TO COSETTE WHO HAD
NEVER HAD A DOLL IN HER LIFE A REAL DOLL TO MAKE USE OF THE EXPRESSION
WHICH ALL CHILDREN WILL UNDERSTAND
ALL AT ONCE THE THENARDIER WHO HAD BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH IN THE
ROOM PERCEIVED THAT COSETTE'S MIND WAS DISTRACTED AND THAT INSTEAD OF
WORKING SHE WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE LITTLE ONES AT THEIR PLAY
AH I'VE CAUGHT YOU AT IT SHE CRIED
SO THAT'S THE WAY YOU WORK
I'LL MAKE YOU WORK TO THE TUNE OF THE WHIP THAT I WILL
THE STRANGER TURNED TO THE THENARDIER WITHOUT QUITTING HIS CHAIR
BAH MADAME HE SAID WITH AN ALMOST TIMID AIR LET HER PLAY
SUCH A WISH EXPRESSED BY A TRAVELLER WHO HAD EATEN A SLICE OF MUTTON AND
HAD DRUNK A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF WINE WITH HIS SUPPER AND WHO HAD NOT
THE AIR OF BEING FRIGHTFULLY POOR WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUIVALENT TO AN
ORDER
BUT THAT A MAN WITH SUCH A HAT SHOULD PERMIT HIMSELF SUCH A
DESIRE AND THAT A MAN WITH SUCH A COAT SHOULD PERMIT HIMSELF TO HAVE A
WILL WAS SOMETHING WHICH MADAME THENARDIER DID NOT INTEND TO TOLERATE
SHE RETORTED WITH ACRIMONY
SHE MUST WORK SINCE SHE EATS
I DON'T FEED HER TO DO NOTHING
WHAT IS SHE MAKING WENT ON THE STRANGER IN A GENTLE VOICE WHICH
CONTRASTED STRANGELY WITH HIS BEGGARLY GARMENTS AND HIS PORTER'S
SHOULDERS
THE THENARDIER DEIGNED TO REPLY
STOCKINGS IF YOU PLEASE
STOCKINGS FOR MY LITTLE GIRLS WHO HAVE NONE
SO TO SPEAK AND WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY BAREFOOT JUST NOW
THE MAN LOOKED AT COSETTE'S POOR LITTLE RED FEET AND CONTINUED
WHEN WILL SHE HAVE FINISHED THIS PAIR OF STOCKINGS
SHE HAS AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR GOOD DAYS' WORK ON THEM STILL THE LAZY
CREATURE
AND HOW MUCH WILL THAT PAIR OF STOCKINGS BE WORTH WHEN SHE HAS FINISHED
THEM
THE THENARDIER CAST A GLANCE OF DISDAIN ON HIM
THIRTY SOUS AT LEAST
WILL YOU SELL THEM FOR FIVE FRANCS WENT ON THE MAN
GOOD HEAVENS EXCLAIMED A CARTER WHO WAS LISTENING WITH A LOUD LAUGH
FIVE FRANCS THE DEUCE I SHOULD THINK SO FIVE BALLS
THENARDIER THOUGHT IT TIME TO STRIKE IN
YES SIR IF SUCH IS YOUR FANCY YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THAT PAIR
OF STOCKINGS FOR FIVE FRANCS
WE CAN REFUSE NOTHING TO TRAVELLERS
YOU MUST PAY ON THE SPOT SAID THE THENARDIER IN HER CURT AND
PEREMPTORY FASHION
I WILL BUY THAT PAIR OF STOCKINGS REPLIED THE MAN AND HE ADDED
DRAWING A FIVE FRANC PIECE FROM HIS POCKET AND LAYING IT ON THE TABLE
I WILL PAY FOR THEM
THEN HE TURNED TO COSETTE
NOW I OWN YOUR WORK PLAY MY CHILD
THE CARTER WAS SO MUCH TOUCHED BY THE FIVE FRANC PIECE THAT HE
ABANDONED HIS GLASS AND HASTENED UP
BUT IT'S TRUE HE CRIED EXAMINING IT
A REAL HIND WHEEL AND NOT
COUNTERFEIT
THENARDIER APPROACHED AND SILENTLY PUT THE COIN IN HIS POCKET
THE THENARDIER HAD NO REPLY TO MAKE
SHE BIT HER LIPS AND HER FACE
ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF HATRED
IN THE MEANTIME COSETTE WAS TREMBLING
SHE VENTURED TO ASK
IS IT TRUE MADAME MAY I PLAY
PLAY SAID THE THENARDIER IN A TERRIBLE VOICE
THANKS MADAME SAID COSETTE
AND WHILE HER MOUTH THANKED THE THENARDIER HER WHOLE LITTLE SOUL
THANKED THE TRAVELLER
THENARDIER HAD RESUMED HIS DRINKING HIS WIFE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
WHO CAN THIS YELLOW MAN BE
I HAVE SEEN MILLIONAIRES WITH COATS LIKE THAT REPLIED THENARDIER IN
A SOVEREIGN MANNER
COSETTE HAD DROPPED HER KNITTING BUT HAD NOT LEFT HER SEAT
COSETTE
ALWAYS MOVED AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
SHE PICKED UP SOME OLD RAGS AND HER
LITTLE LEAD SWORD FROM A BOX BEHIND HER
EPONINE AND AZELMA PAID NO ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING ON
THEY HAD JUST
EXECUTED A VERY IMPORTANT OPERATION THEY HAD JUST GOT HOLD OF THE
CAT
THEY HAD THROWN THEIR DOLL ON THE GROUND AND EPONINE WHO WAS
THE ELDER WAS SWATHING THE LITTLE CAT IN SPITE OF ITS MEWING AND ITS
CONTORTIONS IN A QUANTITY OF CLOTHES AND RED AND BLUE SCRAPS
WHILE
PERFORMING THIS SERIOUS AND DIFFICULT WORK SHE WAS SAYING TO HER SISTER
IN THAT SWEET AND ADORABLE LANGUAGE OF CHILDREN WHOSE GRACE LIKE THE
SPLENDOR OF THE BUTTERFLY'S WING VANISHES WHEN ONE ESSAYS TO FIX IT
FAST
YOU SEE SISTER THIS DOLL IS MORE AMUSING THAN THE OTHER
SHE TWISTS
SHE CRIES SHE IS WARM
SEE SISTER LET US PLAY WITH HER
SHE SHALL BE
MY LITTLE GIRL
I WILL BE A LADY
I WILL COME TO SEE YOU AND YOU SHALL
LOOK AT HER
GRADUALLY YOU WILL PERCEIVE HER WHISKERS AND THAT WILL
SURPRISE YOU
AND THEN YOU WILL SEE HER EARS AND THEN YOU WILL SEE HER
TAIL AND IT WILL AMAZE YOU
AND YOU WILL SAY TO ME 'AH MON DIEU AND
I WILL SAY TO YOU 'YES MADAME IT IS MY LITTLE GIRL
LITTLE GIRLS ARE
MADE LIKE THAT JUST AT PRESENT
AZELMA LISTENED ADMIRINGLY TO EPONINE
IN THE MEANTIME THE DRINKERS HAD BEGUN TO SING AN OBSCENE SONG AND
TO LAUGH AT IT UNTIL THE CEILING SHOOK
THENARDIER ACCOMPANIED AND
ENCOURAGED THEM
AS BIRDS MAKE NESTS OUT OF EVERYTHING SO CHILDREN MAKE A DOLL OUT OF
ANYTHING WHICH COMES TO HAND
WHILE EPONINE AND AZELMA WERE BUNDLING UP
THE CAT COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD DRESSED UP HER SWORD
THAT DONE SHE
LAID IT IN HER ARMS AND SANG TO IT SOFTLY TO LULL IT TO SLEEP
THE DOLL IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPERIOUS NEEDS AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE
OF THE MOST CHARMING INSTINCTS OF FEMININE CHILDHOOD
TO CARE FOR TO
CLOTHE TO DECK TO DRESS TO UNDRESS TO REDRESS TO TEACH SCOLD A
LITTLE TO ROCK TO DANDLE TO LULL TO SLEEP TO IMAGINE THAT SOMETHING
IS SOME ONE THEREIN LIES THE WHOLE WOMAN'S FUTURE
WHILE DREAMING AND
CHATTERING MAKING TINY OUTFITS AND BABY CLOTHES WHILE SEWING LITTLE
GOWNS AND CORSAGES AND BODICES THE CHILD GROWS INTO A YOUNG GIRL THE
YOUNG GIRL INTO A BIG GIRL THE BIG GIRL INTO A WOMAN
THE FIRST CHILD
IS THE CONTINUATION OF THE LAST DOLL
A LITTLE GIRL WITHOUT A DOLL IS ALMOST AS UNHAPPY AND QUITE AS
IMPOSSIBLE AS A WOMAN WITHOUT CHILDREN
SO COSETTE HAD MADE HERSELF A DOLL OUT OF THE SWORD
MADAME THENARDIER APPROACHED THE YELLOW MAN MY HUSBAND IS RIGHT SHE
THOUGHT PERHAPS IT IS M
LAFFITTE THERE ARE SUCH QUEER RICH MEN
SHE CAME AND SET HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE
MONSIEUR SAID SHE
AT THIS WORD MONSIEUR THE MAN TURNED UP TO THAT
TIME THE THENARDIER HAD ADDRESSED HIM ONLY AS BRAVE HOMME OR BONHOMME
YOU SEE SIR SHE PURSUED ASSUMING A SWEETISH AIR THAT WAS EVEN MORE
REPULSIVE TO BEHOLD THAN HER FIERCE MIEN I AM WILLING THAT THE CHILD
SHOULD PLAY I DO NOT OPPOSE IT BUT IT IS GOOD FOR ONCE BECAUSE YOU
ARE GENEROUS
YOU SEE SHE HAS NOTHING SHE MUST NEEDS WORK
THEN THIS CHILD IS NOT YOURS DEMANDED THE MAN
OH MON DIEU NO SIR SHE IS A LITTLE BEGGAR WHOM WE HAVE TAKEN IN
THROUGH CHARITY A SORT OF IMBECILE CHILD
SHE MUST HAVE WATER ON THE
BRAIN SHE HAS A LARGE HEAD AS YOU SEE
WE DO WHAT WE CAN FOR HER FOR
WE ARE NOT RICH WE HAVE WRITTEN IN VAIN TO HER NATIVE PLACE AND HAVE
RECEIVED NO REPLY THESE SIX MONTHS
IT MUST BE THAT HER MOTHER IS DEAD
AH SAID THE MAN AND FELL INTO HIS REVERY ONCE MORE
HER MOTHER DIDN'T AMOUNT TO MUCH ADDED THE THENARDIER SHE ABANDONED
HER CHILD
DURING THE WHOLE OF THIS CONVERSATION COSETTE AS THOUGH WARNED BY SOME
INSTINCT THAT SHE WAS UNDER DISCUSSION HAD NOT TAKEN HER EYES FROM THE
THENARDIER'S FACE SHE LISTENED VAGUELY SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS HERE AND
THERE
MEANWHILE THE DRINKERS ALL THREE QUARTERS INTOXICATED WERE REPEATING
THEIR UNCLEAN REFRAIN WITH REDOUBLED GAYETY IT WAS A HIGHLY SPICED AND
WANTON SONG IN WHICH THE VIRGIN AND THE INFANT JESUS WERE INTRODUCED
THE THENARDIER WENT OFF TO TAKE PART IN THE SHOUTS OF LAUGHTER
COSETTE
FROM HER POST UNDER THE TABLE GAZED AT THE FIRE WHICH WAS REFLECTED
FROM HER FIXED EYES
SHE HAD BEGUN TO ROCK THE SORT OF BABY WHICH SHE
HAD MADE AND AS SHE ROCKED IT SHE SANG IN A LOW VOICE MY MOTHER IS
DEAD MY MOTHER IS DEAD MY MOTHER IS DEAD
ON BEING URGED AFRESH BY THE HOSTESS THE YELLOW MAN THE MILLIONAIRE
CONSENTED AT LAST TO TAKE SUPPER
WHAT DOES MONSIEUR WISH
BREAD AND CHEESE SAID THE MAN
DECIDEDLY HE IS A BEGGAR THOUGHT MADAME THENARDIER
THE DRUNKEN MEN WERE STILL SINGING THEIR SONG AND THE CHILD UNDER THE
TABLE WAS SINGING HERS
ALL AT ONCE COSETTE PAUSED SHE HAD JUST TURNED ROUND AND CAUGHT SIGHT
OF THE LITTLE THENARDIERS' DOLL WHICH THEY HAD ABANDONED FOR THE CAT
AND HAD LEFT ON THE FLOOR A FEW PACES FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE
THEN SHE DROPPED THE SWADDLED SWORD WHICH ONLY HALF MET HER NEEDS AND
CAST HER EYES SLOWLY ROUND THE ROOM
MADAME THENARDIER WAS WHISPERING TO
HER HUSBAND AND COUNTING OVER SOME MONEY PONINE AND ZELMA WERE PLAYING
WITH THE CAT THE TRAVELLERS WERE EATING OR DRINKING OR SINGING NOT
A GLANCE WAS FIXED ON HER
SHE HAD NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE SHE CREPT OUT
FROM UNDER THE TABLE ON HER HANDS AND KNEES MADE SURE ONCE MORE THAT NO
ONE WAS WATCHING HER THEN SHE SLIPPED QUICKLY UP TO THE DOLL AND SEIZED
IT
AN INSTANT LATER SHE WAS IN HER PLACE AGAIN SEATED MOTIONLESS AND
ONLY TURNED SO AS TO CAST A SHADOW ON THE DOLL WHICH SHE HELD IN HER
ARMS
THE HAPPINESS OF PLAYING WITH A DOLL WAS SO RARE FOR HER THAT IT
CONTAINED ALL THE VIOLENCE OF VOLUPTUOUSNESS
NO ONE HAD SEEN HER EXCEPT THE TRAVELLER WHO WAS SLOWLY DEVOURING HIS
MEAGRE SUPPER
THIS JOY LASTED ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
BUT WITH ALL THE PRECAUTIONS THAT COSETTE HAD TAKEN SHE DID NOT PERCEIVE
THAT ONE OF THE DOLL'S LEGS STUCK OUT AND THAT THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH
LIGHTED IT UP VERY VIVIDLY
THAT PINK AND SHINING FOOT PROJECTING FROM
THE SHADOW SUDDENLY STRUCK THE EYE OF AZELMA WHO SAID TO EPONINE
LOOK SISTER
THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS PAUSED IN STUPEFACTION COSETTE HAD DARED TO TAKE
THEIR DOLL
EPONINE ROSE AND WITHOUT RELEASING THE CAT SHE RAN TO HER MOTHER AND
BEGAN TO TUG AT HER SKIRT
LET ME ALONE SAID HER MOTHER WHAT DO YOU WANT
MOTHER SAID THE CHILD LOOK THERE
AND SHE POINTED TO COSETTE
COSETTE ABSORBED IN THE ECSTASIES OF POSSESSION NO LONGER SAW OR HEARD
ANYTHING
MADAME THENARDIER'S COUNTENANCE ASSUMED THAT PECULIAR EXPRESSION WHICH
IS COMPOSED OF THE TERRIBLE MINGLED WITH THE TRIFLES OF LIFE AND WHICH
HAS CAUSED THIS STYLE OF WOMAN TO BE NAMED MEGAERAS
ON THIS OCCASION WOUNDED PRIDE EXASPERATED HER WRATH STILL FURTHER
COSETTE HAD OVERSTEPPED ALL BOUNDS COSETTE HAD LAID VIOLENT HANDS ON
THE DOLL BELONGING TO THESE YOUNG LADIES A CZARINA WHO SHOULD SEE
A MUZHIK TRYING ON HER IMPERIAL SON'S BLUE RIBBON WOULD WEAR NO OTHER
FACE
SHE SHRIEKED IN A VOICE RENDERED HOARSE WITH INDIGNATION
COSETTE
COSETTE STARTED AS THOUGH THE EARTH HAD TREMBLED BENEATH HER SHE TURNED
ROUND
COSETTE REPEATED THE THENARDIER
COSETTE TOOK THE DOLL AND LAID IT GENTLY ON THE FLOOR WITH A SORT OF
VENERATION MINGLED WITH DESPAIR THEN WITHOUT TAKING HER EYES FROM
IT SHE CLASPED HER HANDS AND WHAT IS TERRIBLE TO RELATE OF A CHILD
OF THAT AGE SHE WRUNG THEM THEN NOT ONE OF THE EMOTIONS OF THE DAY
NEITHER THE TRIP TO THE FOREST NOR THE WEIGHT OF THE BUCKET OF WATER
NOR THE LOSS OF THE MONEY NOR THE SIGHT OF THE WHIP NOR EVEN THE SAD
WORDS WHICH SHE HAD HEARD MADAME THENARDIER UTTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO WRING
THIS FROM HER SHE WEPT SHE BURST OUT SOBBING
MEANWHILE THE TRAVELLER HAD RISEN TO HIS FEET
WHAT IS THE MATTER HE SAID TO THE THENARDIER
DON'T YOU SEE SAID THE THENARDIER POINTING TO THE CORPUS DELICTI
WHICH LAY AT COSETTE'S FEET
WELL WHAT OF IT RESUMED THE MAN
THAT BEGGAR REPLIED THE THENARDIER HAS PERMITTED HERSELF TO TOUCH
THE CHILDREN'S DOLL
ALL THIS NOISE FOR THAT SAID THE MAN WELL WHAT IF SHE DID PLAY
WITH THAT DOLL
SHE TOUCHED IT WITH HER DIRTY HANDS PURSUED THE THENARDIER WITH HER
FRIGHTFUL HANDS
HERE COSETTE REDOUBLED HER SOBS
WILL YOU STOP YOUR NOISE SCREAMED THE THENARDIER
THE MAN WENT STRAIGHT TO THE STREET DOOR OPENED IT AND STEPPED OUT
AS SOON AS HE HAD GONE THE THENARDIER PROFITED BY HIS ABSENCE TO GIVE
COSETTE A HEARTY KICK UNDER THE TABLE WHICH MADE THE CHILD UTTER LOUD
CRIES
THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN THE MAN RE APPEARED HE CARRIED IN BOTH HANDS THE
FABULOUS DOLL WHICH WE HAVE MENTIONED AND WHICH ALL THE VILLAGE BRATS
HAD BEEN STARING AT EVER SINCE THE MORNING AND HE SET IT UPRIGHT IN
FRONT OF COSETTE SAYING
HERE THIS IS FOR YOU
IT MUST BE SUPPOSED THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE HOUR AND MORE WHICH HE HAD
SPENT THERE HE HAD TAKEN CONFUSED NOTICE THROUGH HIS REVERY OF THAT
TOY SHOP LIGHTED UP BY FIRE POTS AND CANDLES SO SPLENDIDLY THAT IT WAS
VISIBLE LIKE AN ILLUMINATION THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE DRINKING SHOP
COSETTE RAISED HER EYES SHE GAZED AT THE MAN APPROACHING HER WITH THAT
DOLL AS SHE MIGHT HAVE GAZED AT THE SUN SHE HEARD THE UNPRECEDENTED
WORDS IT IS FOR YOU SHE STARED AT HIM SHE STARED AT THE DOLL THEN
SHE SLOWLY RETREATED AND HID HERSELF AT THE EXTREME END UNDER THE
TABLE IN A CORNER OF THE WALL
SHE NO LONGER CRIED SHE NO LONGER WEPT SHE HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NO
LONGER DARING TO BREATHE
THE THENARDIER EPONINE AND AZELMA WERE LIKE STATUES ALSO THE VERY
DRINKERS HAD PAUSED A SOLEMN SILENCE REIGNED THROUGH THE WHOLE ROOM
MADAME THENARDIER PETRIFIED AND MUTE RECOMMENCED HER CONJECTURES WHO
IS THAT OLD FELLOW IS HE A POOR MAN IS HE A MILLIONAIRE PERHAPS HE IS
BOTH THAT IS TO SAY A THIEF
THE FACE OF THE MALE THENARDIER PRESENTED THAT EXPRESSIVE FOLD WHICH
ACCENTUATES THE HUMAN COUNTENANCE WHENEVER THE DOMINANT INSTINCT APPEARS
THERE IN ALL ITS BESTIAL FORCE
THE TAVERN KEEPER STARED ALTERNATELY AT
THE DOLL AND AT THE TRAVELLER HE SEEMED TO BE SCENTING OUT THE MAN AS
HE WOULD HAVE SCENTED OUT A BAG OF MONEY
THIS DID NOT LAST LONGER THAN
THE SPACE OF A FLASH OF LIGHTNING
HE STEPPED UP TO HIS WIFE AND SAID TO
HER IN A LOW VOICE
THAT MACHINE COSTS AT LEAST THIRTY FRANCS
NO NONSENSE
DOWN ON YOUR
BELLY BEFORE THAT MAN
GROSS NATURES HAVE THIS IN COMMON WITH NAIVE NATURES THAT THEY POSSESS
NO TRANSITION STATE
WELL COSETTE SAID THE THENARDIER IN A VOICE THAT STROVE TO BE
SWEET AND WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF THE BITTER HONEY OF MALICIOUS WOMEN
AREN'T YOU GOING TO TAKE YOUR DOLL
COSETTE VENTURED TO EMERGE FROM HER HOLE
THE GENTLEMAN HAS GIVEN YOU A DOLL MY LITTLE COSETTE SAID
THENARDIER WITH A CARESSING AIR
TAKE IT IT IS YOURS
COSETTE GAZED AT THE MARVELLOUS DOLL IN A SORT OF TERROR
HER FACE WAS
STILL FLOODED WITH TEARS BUT HER EYES BEGAN TO FILL LIKE THE SKY AT
DAYBREAK WITH STRANGE BEAMS OF JOY
WHAT SHE FELT AT THAT MOMENT WAS
A LITTLE LIKE WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT IF SHE HAD BEEN ABRUPTLY TOLD
LITTLE ONE YOU ARE THE QUEEN OF FRANCE
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT IF SHE TOUCHED THAT DOLL LIGHTNING WOULD DART
FROM IT
THIS WAS TRUE UP TO A CERTAIN POINT FOR SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT THE
THENARDIER WOULD SCOLD AND BEAT HER
NEVERTHELESS THE ATTRACTION CARRIED THE DAY
SHE ENDED BY DRAWING NEAR
AND MURMURING TIMIDLY AS SHE TURNED TOWARDS MADAME THENARDIER
MAY I MADAME
NO WORDS CAN RENDER THAT AIR AT ONCE DESPAIRING TERRIFIED AND
ECSTATIC
PARDI CRIED THE THENARDIER IT IS YOURS
THE GENTLEMAN HAS GIVEN IT
TO YOU
TRULY SIR SAID COSETTE
IS IT TRUE IS THE 'LADY' MINE
THE STRANGER'S EYES SEEMED TO BE FULL OF TEARS
HE APPEARED TO HAVE
REACHED THAT POINT OF EMOTION WHERE A MAN DOES NOT SPEAK FOR FEAR LEST
HE SHOULD WEEP
HE NODDED TO COSETTE AND PLACED THE LADY'S HAND IN
HER TINY HAND
COSETTE HASTILY WITHDREW HER HAND AS THOUGH THAT OF THE LADY SCORCHED
HER AND BEGAN TO STARE AT THE FLOOR
WE ARE FORCED TO ADD THAT AT THAT
MOMENT SHE STUCK OUT HER TONGUE IMMODERATELY
ALL AT ONCE SHE WHEELED
ROUND AND SEIZED THE DOLL IN A TRANSPORT
I SHALL CALL HER CATHERINE SHE SAID
IT WAS AN ODD MOMENT WHEN COSETTE'S RAGS MET AND CLASPED THE RIBBONS AND
FRESH PINK MUSLINS OF THE DOLL
MADAME SHE RESUMED MAY I PUT HER ON A CHAIR
YES MY CHILD REPLIED THE THENARDIER
IT WAS NOW THE TURN OF EPONINE AND AZELMA TO GAZE AT COSETTE WITH ENVY
COSETTE PLACED CATHERINE ON A CHAIR THEN SEATED HERSELF ON THE FLOOR
IN FRONT OF HER AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD IN AN
ATTITUDE OF CONTEMPLATION
PLAY COSETTE SAID THE STRANGER
OH I AM PLAYING RETURNED THE CHILD
THIS STRANGER THIS UNKNOWN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD THE AIR OF A VISIT WHICH
PROVIDENCE WAS MAKING ON COSETTE WAS THE PERSON WHOM THE THENARDIER
HATED WORSE THAN ANY ONE IN THE WORLD AT THAT MOMENT
HOWEVER IT WAS
NECESSARY TO CONTROL HERSELF
HABITUATED AS SHE WAS TO DISSIMULATION
THROUGH ENDEAVORING TO COPY HER HUSBAND IN ALL HIS ACTIONS THESE
EMOTIONS WERE MORE THAN SHE COULD ENDURE
SHE MADE HASTE TO SEND HER
DAUGHTERS TO BED THEN SHE ASKED THE MAN'S PERMISSION TO SEND COSETTE
OFF ALSO FOR SHE HAS WORKED HARD ALL DAY SHE ADDED WITH A MATERNAL
AIR
COSETTE WENT OFF TO BED CARRYING CATHERINE IN HER ARMS
FROM TIME TO TIME THE THENARDIER WENT TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WHERE
HER HUSBAND WAS TO RELIEVE HER SOUL AS SHE SAID
SHE EXCHANGED WITH
HER HUSBAND WORDS WHICH WERE ALL THE MORE FURIOUS BECAUSE SHE DARED NOT
UTTER THEM ALOUD
OLD BEAST WHAT HAS HE GOT IN HIS BELLY TO COME AND UPSET US IN THIS
MANNER TO WANT THAT LITTLE MONSTER TO PLAY TO GIVE AWAY FORTY FRANC
DOLLS TO A JADE THAT I WOULD SELL FOR FORTY SOUS SO I WOULD A LITTLE
MORE AND HE WILL BE SAYING YOUR MAJESTY TO HER AS THOUGH TO THE DUCHESS
DE BERRY IS THERE ANY SENSE IN IT IS HE MAD THEN THAT MYSTERIOUS OLD
FELLOW
WHY IT IS PERFECTLY SIMPLE REPLIED THENARDIER IF THAT AMUSES HIM
IT AMUSES YOU TO HAVE THE LITTLE ONE WORK IT AMUSES HIM TO HAVE HER
PLAY
HE'S ALL RIGHT
A TRAVELLER CAN DO WHAT HE PLEASES WHEN HE PAYS
FOR IT
IF THE OLD FELLOW IS A PHILANTHROPIST WHAT IS THAT TO YOU IF
HE IS AN IMBECILE IT DOES NOT CONCERN YOU
WHAT ARE YOU WORRYING FOR
SO LONG AS HE HAS MONEY
THE LANGUAGE OF A MASTER AND THE REASONING OF AN INNKEEPER NEITHER OF
WHICH ADMITTED OF ANY REPLY
THE MAN HAD PLACED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND RESUMED HIS THOUGHTFUL
ATTITUDE
ALL THE OTHER TRAVELLERS BOTH PEDLERS AND CARTERS HAD
WITHDRAWN A LITTLE AND HAD CEASED SINGING
THEY WERE STARING AT HIM
FROM A DISTANCE WITH A SORT OF RESPECTFUL AWE
THIS POORLY DRESSED
MAN WHO DREW HIND WHEELS FROM HIS POCKET WITH SO MUCH EASE AND
WHO LAVISHED GIGANTIC DOLLS ON DIRTY LITTLE BRATS IN WOODEN SHOES WAS
CERTAINLY A MAGNIFICENT FELLOW AND ONE TO BE FEARED
MANY HOURS PASSED
THE MIDNIGHT MASS WAS OVER THE CHIMES HAD CEASED
THE DRINKERS HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE THE DRINKING SHOP WAS CLOSED
THE PUBLIC ROOM WAS DESERTED THE FIRE EXTINCT THE STRANGER STILL
REMAINED IN THE SAME PLACE AND THE SAME ATTITUDE
FROM TIME TO TIME HE
CHANGED THE ELBOW ON WHICH HE LEANED
THAT WAS ALL BUT HE HAD NOT SAID
A WORD SINCE COSETTE HAD LEFT THE ROOM
THE THENARDIERS ALONE OUT OF POLITENESS AND CURIOSITY HAD REMAINED IN
THE ROOM
IS HE GOING TO PASS THE NIGHT IN THAT FASHION GRUMBLED THE
THENARDIER
WHEN TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING STRUCK SHE DECLARED HERSELF
VANQUISHED AND SAID TO HER HUSBAND I'M GOING TO BED
DO AS YOU LIKE
HER HUSBAND SEATED HIMSELF AT A TABLE IN THE CORNER LIGHTED A CANDLE
AND BEGAN TO READ THE COURRIER FRANCAIS
A GOOD HOUR PASSED THUS
THE WORTHY INN KEEPER HAD PERUSED THE COURRIER
FRANCAIS AT LEAST THREE TIMES FROM THE DATE OF THE NUMBER TO THE
PRINTER'S NAME
THE STRANGER DID NOT STIR
THENARDIER FIDGETED COUGHED SPIT BLEW HIS NOSE AND CREAKED HIS
CHAIR
NOT A MOVEMENT ON THE MAN'S PART
IS HE ASLEEP THOUGHT
THENARDIER
THE MAN WAS NOT ASLEEP BUT NOTHING COULD AROUSE HIM
AT LAST THENARDIER TOOK OFF HIS CAP STEPPED GENTLY UP TO HIM AND
VENTURED TO SAY
IS NOT MONSIEUR GOING TO HIS REPOSE
NOT GOING TO BED WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO HIM EXCESSIVE AND FAMILIAR
TO
REPOSE SMACKED OF LUXURY AND RESPECT
THESE WORDS POSSESS THE MYSTERIOUS
AND ADMIRABLE PROPERTY OF SWELLING THE BILL ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
A
CHAMBER WHERE ONE SLEEPS COSTS TWENTY SOUS A CHAMBER IN WHICH ONE
REPOSES COSTS TWENTY FRANCS
WELL SAID THE STRANGER YOU ARE RIGHT
WHERE IS YOUR STABLE
SIR EXCLAIMED THENARDIER WITH A SMILE I WILL CONDUCT YOU SIR
HE TOOK THE CANDLE THE MAN PICKED UP HIS BUNDLE AND CUDGEL AND
THENARDIER CONDUCTED HIM TO A CHAMBER ON THE FIRST FLOOR WHICH WAS OF
RARE SPLENDOR ALL FURNISHED IN MAHOGANY WITH A LOW BEDSTEAD CURTAINED
WITH RED CALICO
WHAT IS THIS SAID THE TRAVELLER
IT IS REALLY OUR BRIDAL CHAMBER SAID THE TAVERN KEEPER
MY WIFE AND
I OCCUPY ANOTHER
THIS IS ONLY ENTERED THREE OR FOUR TIMES A YEAR
I SHOULD HAVE LIKED THE STABLE QUITE AS WELL SAID THE MAN ABRUPTLY
THENARDIER PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR THIS UNAMIABLE REMARK
HE LIGHTED TWO PERFECTLY FRESH WAX CANDLES WHICH FIGURED ON THE
CHIMNEY PIECE
A VERY GOOD FIRE WAS FLICKERING ON THE HEARTH
ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE UNDER A GLASS GLOBE STOOD A WOMAN'S HEAD DRESS IN
SILVER WIRE AND ORANGE FLOWERS
AND WHAT IS THIS RESUMED THE STRANGER
THAT SIR SAID THENARDIER IS MY WIFE'S WEDDING BONNET
THE TRAVELLER SURVEYED THE OBJECT WITH A GLANCE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY
THERE REALLY WAS A TIME THEN WHEN THAT MONSTER WAS A MAIDEN
THENARDIER LIED HOWEVER
WHEN HE HAD LEASED THIS PALTRY BUILDING FOR
THE PURPOSE OF CONVERTING IT INTO A TAVERN HE HAD FOUND THIS CHAMBER
DECORATED IN JUST THIS MANNER AND HAD PURCHASED THE FURNITURE AND
OBTAINED THE ORANGE FLOWERS AT SECOND HAND WITH THE IDEA THAT THIS
WOULD CAST A GRACEFUL SHADOW ON HIS SPOUSE AND WOULD RESULT IN WHAT
THE ENGLISH CALL RESPECTABILITY FOR HIS HOUSE
WHEN THE TRAVELLER TURNED ROUND THE HOST HAD DISAPPEARED
THENARDIER
HAD WITHDRAWN DISCREETLY WITHOUT VENTURING TO WISH HIM A GOOD NIGHT
AS HE DID NOT WISH TO TREAT WITH DISRESPECTFUL CORDIALITY A MAN WHOM HE
PROPOSED TO FLEECE ROYALLY THE FOLLOWING MORNING
THE INN KEEPER RETIRED TO HIS ROOM
HIS WIFE WAS IN BED BUT SHE WAS NOT
ASLEEP
WHEN SHE HEARD HER HUSBAND'S STEP SHE TURNED OVER AND SAID TO
HIM
DO YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO TURN COSETTE OUT OF DOORS TO MORROW
THENARDIER REPLIED COLDLY
HOW YOU DO GO ON
THEY EXCHANGED NO FURTHER WORDS AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER THEIR CANDLE
WAS EXTINGUISHED
AS FOR THE TRAVELLER HE HAD DEPOSITED HIS CUDGEL AND HIS BUNDLE IN A
CORNER
THE LANDLORD ONCE GONE HE THREW HIMSELF INTO AN ARM CHAIR AND
REMAINED FOR SOME TIME BURIED IN THOUGHT
THEN HE REMOVED HIS SHOES
TOOK ONE OF THE TWO CANDLES BLEW OUT THE OTHER OPENED THE DOOR AND
QUITTED THE ROOM GAZING ABOUT HIM LIKE A PERSON WHO IS IN SEARCH OF
SOMETHING
HE TRAVERSED A CORRIDOR AND CAME UPON A STAIRCASE
THERE HE
HEARD A VERY FAINT AND GENTLE SOUND LIKE THE BREATHING OF A CHILD
HE
FOLLOWED THIS SOUND AND CAME TO A SORT OF TRIANGULAR RECESS BUILT UNDER
THE STAIRCASE OR RATHER FORMED BY THE STAIRCASE ITSELF
THIS RECESS WAS
NOTHING ELSE THAN THE SPACE UNDER THE STEPS
THERE IN THE MIDST OF ALL
SORTS OF OLD PAPERS AND POTSHERDS AMONG DUST AND SPIDERS' WEBS WAS A
BED IF ONE CAN CALL BY THE NAME OF BED A STRAW PALLET SO FULL OF HOLES
AS TO DISPLAY THE STRAW AND A COVERLET SO TATTERED AS TO SHOW THE
PALLET
NO SHEETS
THIS WAS PLACED ON THE FLOOR
IN THIS BED COSETTE WAS SLEEPING
THE MAN APPROACHED AND GAZED DOWN UPON HER
COSETTE WAS IN A PROFOUND SLEEP SHE WAS FULLY DRESSED
IN THE WINTER
SHE DID NOT UNDRESS IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE SO COLD
AGAINST HER BREAST WAS PRESSED THE DOLL WHOSE LARGE EYES WIDE OPEN
GLITTERED IN THE DARK
FROM TIME TO TIME SHE GAVE VENT TO A DEEP SIGH AS
THOUGH SHE WERE ON THE POINT OF WAKING AND SHE STRAINED THE DOLL ALMOST
CONVULSIVELY IN HER ARMS
BESIDE HER BED THERE WAS ONLY ONE OF HER
WOODEN SHOES
A DOOR WHICH STOOD OPEN NEAR COSETTE'S PALLET PERMITTED A VIEW OF A
RATHER LARGE DARK ROOM
THE STRANGER STEPPED INTO IT
AT THE FURTHER
EXTREMITY THROUGH A GLASS DOOR HE SAW TWO SMALL VERY WHITE BEDS
THEY BELONGED TO EPONINE AND AZELMA
BEHIND THESE BEDS AND HALF HIDDEN
STOOD AN UNCURTAINED WICKER CRADLE IN WHICH THE LITTLE BOY WHO HAD
CRIED ALL THE EVENING LAY ASLEEP
THE STRANGER CONJECTURED THAT THIS CHAMBER CONNECTED WITH THAT OF THE
THENARDIER PAIR
HE WAS ON THE POINT OF RETREATING WHEN HIS EYE FELL
UPON THE FIREPLACE ONE OF THOSE VAST TAVERN CHIMNEYS WHERE THERE IS
ALWAYS SO LITTLE FIRE WHEN THERE IS ANY FIRE AT ALL AND WHICH ARE
SO COLD TO LOOK AT
THERE WAS NO FIRE IN THIS ONE THERE WAS NOT EVEN
ASHES BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH ATTRACTED THE STRANGER'S GAZE
NEVERTHELESS
IT WAS TWO TINY CHILDREN'S SHOES COQUETTISH IN SHAPE
AND UNEQUAL IN SIZE
THE TRAVELLER RECALLED THE GRACEFUL AND IMMEMORIAL
CUSTOM IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHICH CHILDREN PLACE THEIR SHOES IN THE
CHIMNEY ON CHRISTMAS EVE THERE TO AWAIT IN THE DARKNESS SOME SPARKLING
GIFT FROM THEIR GOOD FAIRY
EPONINE AND AZELMA HAD TAKEN CARE NOT TO
OMIT THIS AND EACH OF THEM HAD SET ONE OF HER SHOES ON THE HEARTH
THE TRAVELLER BENT OVER THEM
THE FAIRY THAT IS TO SAY THEIR MOTHER HAD ALREADY PAID HER VISIT AND
IN EACH HE SAW A BRAND NEW AND SHINING TEN SOU PIECE
THE MAN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AND WAS ON THE POINT OF WITHDRAWING
WHEN FAR IN IN THE DARKEST CORNER OF THE HEARTH HE CAUGHT SIGHT
OF ANOTHER OBJECT
HE LOOKED AT IT AND RECOGNIZED A WOODEN SHOE A
FRIGHTFUL SHOE OF THE COARSEST DESCRIPTION HALF DILAPIDATED AND ALL
COVERED WITH ASHES AND DRIED MUD
IT WAS COSETTE'S SABOT
COSETTE WITH
THAT TOUCHING TRUST OF CHILDHOOD WHICH CAN ALWAYS BE DECEIVED YET NEVER
DISCOURAGED HAD PLACED HER SHOE ON THE HEARTH STONE ALSO
HOPE IN A CHILD WHO HAS NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING BUT DESPAIR IS A SWEET AND
TOUCHING THING
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THIS WOODEN SHOE
THE STRANGER FUMBLED IN HIS WAISTCOAT BENT OVER AND PLACED A LOUIS D'OR
IN COSETTE'S SHOE
THEN HE REGAINED HIS OWN CHAMBER WITH THE STEALTHY TREAD OF A WOLF
CHAPTER IX THENARDIER AND HIS MANOEUVRES
ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING TWO HOURS AT LEAST BEFORE DAY BREAK
THENARDIER SEATED BESIDE A CANDLE IN THE PUBLIC ROOM OF THE TAVERN PEN
IN HAND WAS MAKING OUT THE BILL FOR THE TRAVELLER WITH THE YELLOW COAT
HIS WIFE STANDING BESIDE HIM AND HALF BENT OVER HIM WAS FOLLOWING
HIM WITH HER EYES
THEY EXCHANGED NOT A WORD
ON THE ONE HAND THERE WAS
PROFOUND MEDITATION ON THE OTHER THE RELIGIOUS ADMIRATION WITH WHICH
ONE WATCHES THE BIRTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF A MARVEL OF THE HUMAN MIND
A
NOISE WAS AUDIBLE IN THE HOUSE IT WAS THE LARK SWEEPING THE STAIRS
AFTER THE LAPSE OF A GOOD QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND SOME ERASURES
THENARDIER PRODUCED THE FOLLOWING MASTERPIECE

MINGLED WITH SOME HESITATION

PEUH HE EXCLAIMED
IT WAS THE ACCENT OF CASTLEREAGH AUDITING FRANCE'S BILL AT THE CONGRESS
OF VIENNA
MONSIEUR THENARDIER YOU ARE RIGHT HE CERTAINLY OWES THAT MURMURED
THE WIFE WHO WAS THINKING OF THE DOLL BESTOWED ON COSETTE IN THE
PRESENCE OF HER DAUGHTERS
IT IS JUST BUT IT IS TOO MUCH
HE WILL NOT
PAY IT
THENARDIER LAUGHED COLDLY AS USUAL AND SAID
HE WILL PAY
THIS LAUGH WAS THE SUPREME ASSERTION OF CERTAINTY AND AUTHORITY
THAT
WHICH WAS ASSERTED IN THIS MANNER MUST NEEDS BE SO
HIS WIFE DID NOT
INSIST
SHE SET ABOUT ARRANGING THE TABLE HER HUSBAND PACED THE ROOM
A MOMENT
LATER HE ADDED
I OWE FULL FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS
HE WENT AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER MEDITATING WITH HIS
FEET AMONG THE WARM ASHES
AH BY THE WAY RESUMED HIS WIFE YOU DON'T FORGET THAT I'M GOING TO
TURN COSETTE OUT OF DOORS TO DAY THE MONSTER SHE BREAKS MY HEART WITH
THAT DOLL OF HERS I'D RATHER MARRY LOUIS XVIII
THAN KEEP HER ANOTHER
DAY IN THE HOUSE
THENARDIER LIGHTED HIS PIPE AND REPLIED BETWEEN TWO PUFFS
YOU WILL HAND THAT BILL TO THE MAN
THEN HE WENT OUT
HARDLY HAD HE LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THE TRAVELLER ENTERED
THENARDIER INSTANTLY REAPPEARED BEHIND HIM AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS IN
THE HALF OPEN DOOR VISIBLE ONLY TO HIS WIFE
THE YELLOW MAN CARRIED HIS BUNDLE AND HIS CUDGEL IN HIS HAND
UP SO EARLY SAID MADAME THENARDIER IS MONSIEUR LEAVING US ALREADY
AS SHE SPOKE THUS SHE WAS TWISTING THE BILL ABOUT IN HER HANDS WITH AN
EMBARRASSED AIR AND MAKING CREASES IN IT WITH HER NAILS
HER HARD
FACE PRESENTED A SHADE WHICH WAS NOT HABITUAL WITH IT TIMIDITY AND
SCRUPLES
TO PRESENT SUCH A BILL TO A MAN WHO HAD SO COMPLETELY THE AIR OF A POOR
WRETCH SEEMED DIFFICULT TO HER
THE TRAVELLER APPEARED TO BE PREOCCUPIED AND ABSENT MINDED
HE
REPLIED
YES MADAME I AM GOING
SO MONSIEUR HAS NO BUSINESS IN MONTFERMEIL
NO I WAS PASSING THROUGH
THAT IS ALL
WHAT DO I OWE YOU MADAME HE
ADDED
THE THENARDIER SILENTLY HANDED HIM THE FOLDED BILL
THE MAN UNFOLDED THE PAPER AND GLANCED AT IT BUT HIS THOUGHTS WERE
EVIDENTLY ELSEWHERE
MADAME HE RESUMED IS BUSINESS GOOD HERE IN MONTFERMEIL
SO SO MONSIEUR REPLIED THE THENARDIER STUPEFIED AT NOT WITNESSING
ANOTHER SORT OF EXPLOSION
SHE CONTINUED IN A DREARY AND LAMENTABLE TONE
OH MONSIEUR TIMES ARE SO HARD AND THEN WE HAVE SO FEW BOURGEOIS IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD ALL THE PEOPLE ARE POOR YOU SEE
IF WE HAD NOT NOW
AND THEN SOME RICH AND GENEROUS TRAVELLERS LIKE MONSIEUR WE SHOULD
NOT GET ALONG AT ALL

THE LICENSE THE IMPOSTS THE DOOR AND WINDOW TAX THE HUNDREDTHS
MONSIEUR IS AWARE THAT THE GOVERNMENT DEMANDS A TERRIBLE DEAL OF MONEY
AND THEN I HAVE MY DAUGHTERS

THE MAN RESUMED IN THAT VOICE WHICH HE STROVE TO RENDER INDIFFERENT
AND IN WHICH THERE LINGERED A TREMOR
WHAT IF ONE WERE TO RID YOU OF HER
WHO COSETTE

THE LANDLADY'S RED AND VIOLENT FACE BRIGHTENED UP HIDEOUSLY

IN THE MEANTIME PURSUED THE MAN I WILL PAY YOU WHAT I OWE YOU
HOW
MUCH IS IT
HE CAST A GLANCE ON THE BILL AND COULD NOT RESTRAIN A START OF
SURPRISE
TWENTY THREE FRANCS
HE LOOKED AT THE LANDLADY AND REPEATED
TWENTY THREE FRANCS
THERE WAS IN THE ENUNCIATION OF THESE WORDS THUS REPEATED AN ACCENT
BETWEEN AN EXCLAMATION AND AN INTERROGATION POINT
THE THENARDIER HAD HAD TIME TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR THE SHOCK
SHE
REPLIED WITH ASSURANCE
GOOD GRACIOUS YES SIR IT IS TWENTY THREE FRANCS
THE STRANGER LAID FIVE FIVE FRANC PIECES ON THE TABLE

AT THAT MOMENT THENARDIER ADVANCED TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND
SAID
MONSIEUR OWES TWENTY SIX SOUS

TWENTY SOUS FOR THE CHAMBER RESUMED THENARDIER COLDLY AND SIX SOUS
FOR HIS SUPPER
AS FOR THE CHILD I MUST DISCUSS THAT MATTER A LITTLE
WITH THE GENTLEMAN
LEAVE US WIFE
MADAME THENARDIER WAS DAZZLED AS WITH THE SHOCK CAUSED BY UNEXPECTED
LIGHTNING FLASHES OF TALENT
SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT A GREAT ACTOR WAS
MAKING HIS ENTRANCE ON THE STAGE UTTERED NOT A WORD IN REPLY AND LEFT
THE ROOM
AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALONE THENARDIER OFFERED THE TRAVELLER A CHAIR
THE TRAVELLER SEATED HIMSELF THENARDIER REMAINED STANDING AND HIS FACE
ASSUMED A SINGULAR EXPRESSION OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP AND SIMPLICITY

TINY THING

AND THE LARK WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER ONE MUST AT LEAST SEE SOME
PETTY SCRAP OF PAPER SOME TRIFLE IN THE WAY OF A PASSPORT YOU KNOW
THE STRANGER STILL SURVEYING HIM WITH THAT GAZE WHICH PENETRATES AS
THE SAYING GOES TO THE VERY DEPTHS OF THE CONSCIENCE REPLIED IN A
GRAVE FIRM VOICE
MONSIEUR THENARDIER ONE DOES NOT REQUIRE A PASSPORT TO TRAVEL FIVE
LEAGUES FROM PARIS
IF I TAKE COSETTE AWAY I SHALL TAKE HER AWAY AND
THAT IS THE END OF THE MATTER
YOU WILL NOT KNOW MY NAME YOU WILL NOT
KNOW MY RESIDENCE YOU WILL NOT KNOW WHERE SHE IS AND MY INTENTION IS
THAT SHE SHALL NEVER SET EYES ON YOU AGAIN SO LONG AS SHE LIVES
I BREAK
THE THREAD WHICH BINDS HER FOOT AND SHE DEPARTS
DOES THAT SUIT YOU
YES OR NO
SINCE GENIUSES LIKE DEMONS RECOGNIZE THE PRESENCE OF A SUPERIOR GOD BY
CERTAIN SIGNS THENARDIER COMPREHENDED THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A VERY
STRONG PERSON
IT WAS LIKE AN INTUITION HE COMPREHENDED IT WITH HIS
CLEAR AND SAGACIOUS PROMPTITUDE
WHILE DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS
SMOKING AND SINGING COARSE SONGS ON THE PRECEDING EVENING HE HAD
DEVOTED THE WHOLE OF THE TIME TO OBSERVING THE STRANGER WATCHING HIM
LIKE A CAT AND STUDYING HIM LIKE A MATHEMATICIAN
HE HAD WATCHED HIM
BOTH ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT FOR THE PLEASURE OF THE THING AND THROUGH
INSTINCT AND HAD SPIED UPON HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN PAID FOR SO
DOING
NOT A MOVEMENT NOT A GESTURE ON THE PART OF THE MAN IN THE
YELLOW GREAT COAT HAD ESCAPED HIM
EVEN BEFORE THE STRANGER HAD SO
CLEARLY MANIFESTED HIS INTEREST IN COSETTE THENARDIER HAD DIVINED HIS
PURPOSE
HE HAD CAUGHT THE OLD MAN'S DEEP GLANCES RETURNING CONSTANTLY
TO THE CHILD
WHO WAS THIS MAN WHY THIS INTEREST WHY THIS HIDEOUS
COSTUME WHEN HE HAD SO MUCH MONEY IN HIS PURSE QUESTIONS WHICH HE PUT
TO HIMSELF WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SOLVE THEM AND WHICH IRRITATED HIM
HE
HAD PONDERED IT ALL NIGHT LONG
HE COULD NOT BE COSETTE'S FATHER
WAS HE
HER GRANDFATHER THEN WHY NOT MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN AT ONCE WHEN ONE HAS
A RIGHT ONE ASSERTS IT
THIS MAN EVIDENTLY HAD NO RIGHT OVER COSETTE
WHAT WAS IT THEN THENARDIER LOST HIMSELF IN CONJECTURES
HE CAUGHT
GLIMPSES OF EVERYTHING BUT HE SAW NOTHING
BE THAT AS IT MAY ON
ENTERING INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE MAN SURE THAT THERE WAS SOME SECRET
IN THE CASE THAT THE LATTER HAD SOME INTEREST IN REMAINING IN THE
SHADOW HE FELT HIMSELF STRONG WHEN HE PERCEIVED FROM THE STRANGER'S
CLEAR AND FIRM RETORT THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE WAS MYSTERIOUS IN
SO SIMPLE A WAY HE BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS WEAK
HE HAD EXPECTED
NOTHING OF THE SORT
HIS CONJECTURES WERE PUT TO THE ROUT
HE RALLIED
HIS IDEAS
HE WEIGHED EVERYTHING IN THE SPACE OF A SECOND
THENARDIER
WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO TAKE IN A SITUATION AT A GLANCE
HE DECIDED
THAT THE MOMENT HAD ARRIVED FOR PROCEEDING STRAIGHTFORWARD AND QUICKLY
AT THAT
HE DID AS GREAT LEADERS DO AT THE DECISIVE MOMENT WHICH THEY
KNOW THAT THEY ALONE RECOGNIZE HE ABRUPTLY UNMASKED HIS BATTERIES
SIR SAID HE I AM IN NEED OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS
THE STRANGER TOOK FROM HIS SIDE POCKET AN OLD POCKETBOOK OF BLACK
LEATHER OPENED IT DREW OUT THREE BANK BILLS WHICH HE LAID ON THE
TABLE
THEN HE PLACED HIS LARGE THUMB ON THE NOTES AND SAID TO THE
INN KEEPER
GO AND FETCH COSETTE
WHILE THIS WAS TAKING PLACE WHAT HAD COSETTE BEEN DOING
ON WAKING UP COSETTE HAD RUN TO GET HER SHOE
IN IT SHE HAD FOUND THE
GOLD PIECE
IT WAS NOT A NAPOLEON IT WAS ONE OF THOSE PERFECTLY NEW
TWENTY FRANC PIECES OF THE RESTORATION ON WHOSE EFFIGY THE LITTLE
PRUSSIAN QUEUE HAD REPLACED THE LAUREL WREATH
COSETTE WAS DAZZLED
HER
DESTINY BEGAN TO INTOXICATE HER
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT A GOLD PIECE WAS
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE SHE HID IT QUICKLY IN HER POCKET AS THOUGH
SHE HAD STOLEN IT
STILL SHE FELT THAT IT REALLY WAS HERS SHE GUESSED
WHENCE HER GIFT HAD COME BUT THE JOY WHICH SHE EXPERIENCED WAS FULL OF
FEAR
SHE WAS HAPPY ABOVE ALL SHE WAS STUPEFIED
SUCH MAGNIFICENT AND
BEAUTIFUL THINGS DID NOT APPEAR REAL
THE DOLL FRIGHTENED HER THE
GOLD PIECE FRIGHTENED HER
SHE TREMBLED VAGUELY IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS
MAGNIFICENCE
THE STRANGER ALONE DID NOT FRIGHTEN HER
ON THE CONTRARY
HE REASSURED HER
EVER SINCE THE PRECEDING EVENING AMID ALL HER
AMAZEMENT EVEN IN HER SLEEP SHE HAD BEEN THINKING IN HER LITTLE
CHILDISH MIND OF THAT MAN WHO SEEMED TO BE SO POOR AND SO SAD AND WHO
WAS SO RICH AND SO KIND
EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED FOR HER SINCE SHE HAD
MET THAT GOOD MAN IN THE FOREST
COSETTE LESS HAPPY THAN THE MOST
INSIGNIFICANT SWALLOW OF HEAVEN HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO TAKE
REFUGE UNDER A MOTHER'S SHADOW AND UNDER A WING
FOR THE LAST FIVE
YEARS THAT IS TO SAY AS FAR BACK AS HER MEMORY RAN THE POOR CHILD HAD
SHIVERED AND TREMBLED
SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN EXPOSED COMPLETELY NAKED
TO THE SHARP WIND OF ADVERSITY NOW IT SEEMED TO HER SHE WAS CLOTHED
FORMERLY HER SOUL HAD SEEMED COLD NOW IT WAS WARM
COSETTE WAS NO
LONGER AFRAID OF THE THENARDIER
SHE WAS NO LONGER ALONE THERE WAS SOME
ONE THERE
SHE HASTILY SET ABOUT HER REGULAR MORNING DUTIES
THAT LOUIS WHICH SHE
HAD ABOUT HER IN THE VERY APRON POCKET WHENCE THE FIFTEEN SOU PIECE HAD
FALLEN ON THE NIGHT BEFORE DISTRACTED HER THOUGHTS
SHE DARED NOT TOUCH
IT BUT SHE SPENT FIVE MINUTES IN GAZING AT IT WITH HER TONGUE HANGING
OUT IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD
AS SHE SWEPT THE STAIRCASE SHE PAUSED
REMAINED STANDING THERE MOTIONLESS FORGETFUL OF HER BROOM AND OF THE
ENTIRE UNIVERSE OCCUPIED IN GAZING AT THAT STAR WHICH WAS BLAZING AT
THE BOTTOM OF HER POCKET
IT WAS DURING ONE OF THESE PERIODS OF CONTEMPLATION THAT THE THENARDIER
JOINED HER
SHE HAD GONE IN SEARCH OF COSETTE AT HER HUSBAND'S ORDERS
WHAT WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED SHE NEITHER STRUCK HER NOR SAID AN
INSULTING WORD TO HER
COSETTE SHE SAID ALMOST GENTLY COME IMMEDIATELY
AN INSTANT LATER COSETTE ENTERED THE PUBLIC ROOM
THE STRANGER TOOK UP THE BUNDLE WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT AND UNTIED IT
THIS
BUNDLE CONTAINED A LITTLE WOOLLEN GOWN AN APRON A FUSTIAN BODICE A
KERCHIEF A PETTICOAT WOOLLEN STOCKINGS SHOES A COMPLETE OUTFIT FOR A
GIRL OF SEVEN YEARS
ALL WAS BLACK
MY CHILD SAID THE MAN TAKE THESE AND GO AND DRESS YOURSELF
QUICKLY
DAYLIGHT WAS APPEARING WHEN THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS OF MONTFERMEIL WHO
HAD BEGUN TO OPEN THEIR DOORS BEHELD A POORLY CLAD OLD MAN LEADING A
LITTLE GIRL DRESSED IN MOURNING AND CARRYING A PINK DOLL IN HER ARMS
PASS ALONG THE ROAD TO PARIS
THEY WERE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF LIVRY
IT WAS OUR MAN AND COSETTE
NO ONE KNEW THE MAN AS COSETTE WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS MANY DID NOT
RECOGNIZE HER
COSETTE WAS GOING AWAY
WITH WHOM SHE DID NOT KNOW
WHITHER SHE KNEW NOT
ALL THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD WAS THAT SHE WAS LEAVING
THE THENARDIER TAVERN BEHIND HER
NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF BIDDING HER
FAREWELL NOR HAD SHE THOUGHT OF TAKING LEAVE OF ANY ONE
SHE WAS
LEAVING THAT HATED AND HATING HOUSE
POOR GENTLE CREATURE WHOSE HEART HAD BEEN REPRESSED UP TO THAT HOUR
COSETTE WALKED ALONG GRAVELY WITH HER LARGE EYES WIDE OPEN AND GAZING
AT THE SKY
SHE HAD PUT HER LOUIS IN THE POCKET OF HER NEW APRON
FROM
TIME TO TIME SHE BENT DOWN AND GLANCED AT IT THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE
GOOD MAN
SHE FELT SOMETHING AS THOUGH SHE WERE BESIDE THE GOOD GOD
CHAPTER X HE WHO SEEKS TO BETTER HIMSELF MAY RENDER HIS SITUATION WORSE
MADAME THENARDIER HAD ALLOWED HER HUSBAND TO HAVE HIS OWN WAY AS WAS
HER WONT
SHE HAD EXPECTED GREAT RESULTS
WHEN THE MAN AND COSETTE HAD
TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE THENARDIER ALLOWED A FULL QUARTER OF AN HOUR
TO ELAPSE THEN HE TOOK HER ASIDE AND SHOWED HER THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED
FRANCS
IS THAT ALL SAID SHE
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE THEY HAD SET UP HOUSEKEEPING THAT SHE HAD
DARED TO CRITICISE ONE OF THE MASTER'S ACTS
THE BLOW TOLD
YOU ARE RIGHT IN SOOTH SAID HE I AM A FOOL
GIVE ME MY HAT
HE FOLDED UP THE THREE BANK BILLS THRUST THEM INTO HIS POCKET AND RAN
OUT IN ALL HASTE BUT HE MADE A MISTAKE AND TURNED TO THE RIGHT FIRST
SOME NEIGHBORS OF WHOM HE MADE INQUIRIES PUT HIM ON THE TRACK AGAIN
THE LARK AND THE MAN HAD BEEN SEEN GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF LIVRY
HE
FOLLOWED THESE HINTS WALKING WITH GREAT STRIDES AND TALKING TO HIMSELF
THE WHILE
THAT MAN IS EVIDENTLY A MILLION DRESSED IN YELLOW AND I AM AN ANIMAL
FIRST HE GAVE TWENTY SOUS THEN FIVE FRANCS THEN FIFTY FRANCS THEN
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS ALL WITH EQUAL READINESS
HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN
FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
BUT I SHALL OVERTAKE HIM
AND THEN THAT BUNDLE OF CLOTHES PREPARED BEFOREHAND FOR THE CHILD ALL
THAT WAS SINGULAR MANY MYSTERIES LAY CONCEALED UNDER IT
ONE DOES NOT
LET MYSTERIES OUT OF ONE'S HAND WHEN ONE HAS ONCE GRASPED THEM
THE
SECRETS OF THE WEALTHY ARE SPONGES OF GOLD ONE MUST KNOW HOW TO SUBJECT
THEM TO PRESSURE
ALL THESE THOUGHTS WHIRLED THROUGH HIS BRAIN
I AM AN
ANIMAL SAID HE
WHEN ONE LEAVES MONTFERMEIL AND REACHES THE TURN WHICH THE ROAD TAKES
THAT RUNS TO LIVRY IT CAN BE SEEN STRETCHING OUT BEFORE ONE TO A GREAT
DISTANCE ACROSS THE PLATEAU
ON ARRIVING THERE HE CALCULATED THAT HE
OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE OLD MAN AND THE CHILD
HE LOOKED AS FAR AS
HIS VISION REACHED AND SAW NOTHING
HE MADE FRESH INQUIRIES BUT HE HAD
WASTED TIME
SOME PASSERS BY INFORMED HIM THAT THE MAN AND CHILD OF WHOM
HE WAS IN SEARCH HAD GONE TOWARDS THE FOREST IN THE DIRECTION OF GAGNY
HE HASTENED IN THAT DIRECTION
THEY WERE FAR IN ADVANCE OF HIM BUT A CHILD WALKS SLOWLY AND HE WALKED
FAST AND THEN HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE COUNTRY
ALL AT ONCE HE PAUSED AND DEALT HIMSELF A BLOW ON HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A
MAN WHO HAS FORGOTTEN SOME ESSENTIAL POINT AND WHO IS READY TO RETRACE
HIS STEPS
I OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN MY GUN SAID HE TO HIMSELF
THENARDIER WAS ONE OF THOSE DOUBLE NATURES WHICH SOMETIMES PASS THROUGH
OUR MIDST WITHOUT OUR BEING AWARE OF THE FACT AND WHO DISAPPEAR WITHOUT
OUR FINDING THEM OUT BECAUSE DESTINY HAS ONLY EXHIBITED ONE SIDE OF
THEM
IT IS THE FATE OF MANY MEN TO LIVE THUS HALF SUBMERGED
IN A
CALM AND EVEN SITUATION THENARDIER POSSESSED ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO
MAKE WE WILL NOT SAY TO BE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE AGREED TO CALL AN HONEST
TRADER A GOOD BOURGEOIS
AT THE SAME TIME CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BEING
GIVEN CERTAIN SHOCKS ARRIVING TO BRING HIS UNDER NATURE TO THE SURFACE
HE HAD ALL THE REQUISITES FOR A BLACKGUARD
HE WAS A SHOPKEEPER IN
WHOM THERE WAS SOME TAINT OF THE MONSTER
SATAN MUST HAVE OCCASIONALLY
CROUCHED DOWN IN SOME CORNER OF THE HOVEL IN WHICH THENARDIER DWELT AND
HAVE FALLEN A DREAMING IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS HIDEOUS MASTERPIECE
AFTER A MOMENTARY HESITATION
BAH HE THOUGHT THEY WILL HAVE TIME TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE
AND HE PURSUED HIS ROAD WALKING RAPIDLY STRAIGHT AHEAD AND WITH ALMOST
AN AIR OF CERTAINTY WITH THE SAGACITY OF A FOX SCENTING A COVEY OF
PARTRIDGES
IN TRUTH WHEN HE HAD PASSED THE PONDS AND HAD TRAVERSED IN AN OBLIQUE
DIRECTION THE LARGE CLEARING WHICH LIES ON THE RIGHT OF THE AVENUE DE
BELLEVUE AND REACHED THAT TURF ALLEY WHICH NEARLY MAKES THE CIRCUIT OF
THE HILL AND COVERS THE ARCH OF THE ANCIENT AQUEDUCT OF THE ABBEY OF
CHELLES HE CAUGHT SIGHT OVER THE TOP OF THE BRUSHWOOD OF THE HAT ON
WHICH HE HAD ALREADY ERECTED SO MANY CONJECTURES IT WAS THAT MAN'S HAT
THE BRUSHWOOD WAS NOT HIGH
THENARDIER RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT THE MAN
AND COSETTE WERE SITTING THERE
THE CHILD COULD NOT BE SEEN ON ACCOUNT
OF HER SMALL SIZE BUT THE HEAD OF HER DOLL WAS VISIBLE
THENARDIER WAS NOT MISTAKEN
THE MAN WAS SITTING THERE AND LETTING
COSETTE GET SOMEWHAT RESTED
THE INN KEEPER WALKED ROUND THE BRUSHWOOD
AND PRESENTED HIMSELF ABRUPTLY TO THE EYES OF THOSE WHOM HE WAS IN
SEARCH OF
PARDON EXCUSE ME SIR HE SAID QUITE BREATHLESS BUT HERE ARE YOUR
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS
SO SAYING HE HANDED THE STRANGER THE THREE BANK BILLS
THE MAN RAISED HIS EYES
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS
THENARDIER REPLIED RESPECTFULLY
IT MEANS SIR THAT I SHALL TAKE BACK COSETTE
COSETTE SHUDDERED AND PRESSED CLOSE TO THE OLD MAN
HE REPLIED GAZING TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THENARDIER'S EYES THE WHILE
AND ENUNCIATING EVERY SYLLABLE DISTINCTLY
YOU ARE GO ING TO TAKE BACK CO SETTE
YES SIR I AM
I WILL TELL YOU I HAVE CONSIDERED THE MATTER
IN FACT
I HAVE NOT THE RIGHT TO GIVE HER TO YOU
I AM AN HONEST MAN YOU SEE
THIS CHILD DOES NOT BELONG TO ME SHE BELONGS TO HER MOTHER
IT WAS HER
MOTHER WHO CONFIDED HER TO ME I CAN ONLY RESIGN HER TO HER MOTHER
YOU
WILL SAY TO ME 'BUT HER MOTHER IS DEAD GOOD IN THAT CASE I CAN ONLY
GIVE THE CHILD UP TO THE PERSON WHO SHALL BRING ME A WRITING SIGNED BY
HER MOTHER TO THE EFFECT THAT I AM TO HAND THE CHILD OVER TO THE PERSON
THEREIN MENTIONED THAT IS CLEAR
THE MAN WITHOUT MAKING ANY REPLY FUMBLED IN HIS POCKET AND THENARDIER
BEHELD THE POCKET BOOK OF BANK BILLS MAKE ITS APPEARANCE ONCE MORE
THE TAVERN KEEPER SHIVERED WITH JOY
GOOD THOUGHT HE LET US HOLD FIRM HE IS GOING TO BRIBE ME
BEFORE OPENING THE POCKET BOOK THE TRAVELLER CAST A GLANCE ABOUT HIM
THE SPOT WAS ABSOLUTELY DESERTED THERE WAS NOT A SOUL EITHER IN THE
WOODS OR IN THE VALLEY
THE MAN OPENED HIS POCKET BOOK ONCE MORE AND
DREW FROM IT NOT THE HANDFUL OF BILLS WHICH THENARDIER EXPECTED BUT A
SIMPLE LITTLE PAPER WHICH HE UNFOLDED AND PRESENTED FULLY OPEN TO THE
INN KEEPER SAYING
YOU ARE RIGHT READ
THENARDIER TOOK THE PAPER AND READ
M
SUR M MARCH 25 1823
MONSIEUR THENARDIER
YOU WILL DELIVER COSETTE TO THIS PERSON
YOU WILL BE PAID FOR ALL THE LITTLE THINGS
I HAVE THE HONOR TO SALUTE YOU WITH RESPECT
FANTINE
YOU KNOW THAT SIGNATURE RESUMED THE MAN
IT CERTAINLY WAS FANTINE'S SIGNATURE THENARDIER RECOGNIZED IT
THERE WAS NO REPLY TO MAKE HE EXPERIENCED TWO VIOLENT VEXATIONS THE
VEXATION OF RENOUNCING THE BRIBERY WHICH HE HAD HOPED FOR AND THE
VEXATION OF BEING BEATEN THE MAN ADDED
YOU MAY KEEP THIS PAPER AS YOUR RECEIPT
THENARDIER RETREATED IN TOLERABLY GOOD ORDER
THIS SIGNATURE IS FAIRLY WELL IMITATED HE GROWLED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
HOWEVER LET IT GO
THEN HE ESSAYED A DESPERATE EFFORT
IT IS WELL SIR HE SAID SINCE YOU ARE THE PERSON BUT I MUST BE
PAID FOR ALL THOSE LITTLE THINGS
A GREAT DEAL IS OWING TO ME
THE MAN ROSE TO HIS FEET FILLIPING THE DUST FROM HIS THREAD BARE
SLEEVE
MONSIEUR THENARDIER IN JANUARY LAST THE MOTHER RECKONED THAT SHE OWED
YOU ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FRANCS
IN FEBRUARY YOU SENT HER A BILL OF
FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS YOU RECEIVED THREE HUNDRED FRANCS AT THE END OF
FEBRUARY AND THREE HUNDRED FRANCS AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH
SINCE THEN
NINE MONTHS HAVE ELAPSED AT FIFTEEN FRANCS A MONTH THE PRICE AGREED
UPON WHICH MAKES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE FRANCS
YOU HAD RECEIVED
ONE HUNDRED FRANCS TOO MUCH THAT MAKES THIRTY FIVE STILL OWING YOU
I
HAVE JUST GIVEN YOU FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS
THENARDIER'S SENSATIONS WERE THOSE OF THE WOLF AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE
FEELS HIMSELF NIPPED AND SEIZED BY THE STEEL JAW OF THE TRAP
WHO IS THIS DEVIL OF A MAN HE THOUGHT
HE DID WHAT THE WOLF DOES HE SHOOK HIMSELF
AUDACITY HAD SUCCEEDED WITH
HIM ONCE
MONSIEUR I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME HE SAID RESOLUTELY AND THIS TIME
CASTING ASIDE ALL RESPECTFUL CEREMONY I SHALL TAKE BACK COSETTE IF YOU
DO NOT GIVE ME A THOUSAND CROWNS
THE STRANGER SAID TRANQUILLY
COME COSETTE
HE TOOK COSETTE BY HIS LEFT HAND AND WITH HIS RIGHT HE PICKED UP HIS
CUDGEL WHICH WAS LYING ON THE GROUND
THENARDIER NOTED THE ENORMOUS SIZE OF THE CUDGEL AND THE SOLITUDE OF THE
SPOT
THE MAN PLUNGED INTO THE FOREST WITH THE CHILD LEAVING THE INN KEEPER
MOTIONLESS AND SPEECHLESS
WHILE THEY WERE WALKING AWAY THENARDIER SCRUTINIZED HIS HUGE SHOULDERS
WHICH WERE A LITTLE ROUNDED AND HIS GREAT FISTS
THEN BRINGING HIS EYES BACK TO HIS OWN PERSON THEY FELL UPON HIS
FEEBLE ARMS AND HIS THIN HANDS
I REALLY MUST HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY
STUPID NOT TO HAVE THOUGHT TO BRING MY GUN HE SAID TO HIMSELF SINCE
I WAS GOING HUNTING
HOWEVER THE INN KEEPER DID NOT GIVE UP
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE HE IS GOING SAID HE AND HE SET OUT TO FOLLOW
THEM AT A DISTANCE
TWO THINGS WERE LEFT ON HIS HANDS AN IRONY IN
THE SHAPE OF THE PAPER SIGNED FANTINE AND A CONSOLATION THE FIFTEEN
HUNDRED FRANCS
THE MAN LED COSETTE OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF LIVRY AND BONDY
HE WALKED
SLOWLY WITH DROOPING HEAD IN AN ATTITUDE OF REFLECTION AND SADNESS
THE WINTER HAD THINNED OUT THE FOREST SO THAT THENARDIER DID NOT LOSE
THEM FROM SIGHT ALTHOUGH HE KEPT AT A GOOD DISTANCE
THE MAN TURNED
ROUND FROM TIME TO TIME AND LOOKED TO SEE IF HE WAS BEING FOLLOWED
ALL AT ONCE HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THENARDIER
HE PLUNGED SUDDENLY INTO
THE BRUSHWOOD WITH COSETTE WHERE THEY COULD BOTH HIDE THEMSELVES
THE
DEUCE SAID THENARDIER AND HE REDOUBLED HIS PACE
THE THICKNESS OF THE UNDERGROWTH FORCED HIM TO DRAW NEARER TO THEM
WHEN
THE MAN HAD REACHED THE DENSEST PART OF THE THICKET HE WHEELED
ROUND
IT WAS IN VAIN THAT THENARDIER SOUGHT TO CONCEAL HIMSELF IN THE
BRANCHES HE COULD NOT PREVENT THE MAN SEEING HIM
THE MAN CAST UPON HIM
AN UNEASY GLANCE THEN ELEVATED HIS HEAD AND CONTINUED HIS COURSE
THE
INN KEEPER SET OUT AGAIN IN PURSUIT
THUS THEY CONTINUED FOR TWO OR
THREE HUNDRED PACES
ALL AT ONCE THE MAN TURNED ROUND ONCE MORE HE SAW
THE INN KEEPER
THIS TIME HE GAZED AT HIM WITH SO SOMBRE AN AIR THAT
THENARDIER DECIDED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO PROCEED FURTHER
THENARDIER
RETRACED HIS STEPS
CHAPTER XI NUMBER 9 430 REAPPEARS AND COSETTE WINS IT IN THE LOTTERY
JEAN VALJEAN WAS NOT DEAD
WHEN HE FELL INTO THE SEA OR RATHER WHEN HE THREW HIMSELF INTO IT HE
WAS NOT IRONED AS WE HAVE SEEN
HE SWAM UNDER WATER UNTIL HE REACHED A
VESSEL AT ANCHOR TO WHICH A BOAT WAS MOORED
HE FOUND MEANS OF HIDING
HIMSELF IN THIS BOAT UNTIL NIGHT
AT NIGHT HE SWAM OFF AGAIN AND
REACHED THE SHORE A LITTLE WAY FROM CAPE BRUN
THERE AS HE DID NOT LACK
MONEY HE PROCURED CLOTHING
A SMALL COUNTRY HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF BALAGUIER WAS AT THAT TIME THE DRESSING ROOM OF ESCAPED CONVICTS A
LUCRATIVE SPECIALTY
THEN JEAN VALJEAN LIKE ALL THE SORRY FUGITIVES
WHO ARE SEEKING TO EVADE THE VIGILANCE OF THE LAW AND SOCIAL FATALITY
PURSUED AN OBSCURE AND UNDULATING ITINERARY
HE FOUND HIS FIRST
REFUGE AT PRADEAUX NEAR BEAUSSET
THEN HE DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARDS
GRAND VILLARD NEAR BRIANCON IN THE HAUTES ALPES
IT WAS A FUMBLING AND
UNEASY FLIGHT A MOLE'S TRACK WHOSE BRANCHINGS ARE UNTRACEABLE
LATER
ON SOME TRACE OF HIS PASSAGE INTO AIN IN THE TERRITORY OF CIVRIEUX
WAS DISCOVERED IN THE PYRENEES AT ACCONS AT THE SPOT CALLED
GRANGE DE DOUMEC NEAR THE MARKET OF CHAVAILLES AND IN THE ENVIRONS OF
PERIGUEUX AT BRUNIES CANTON OF LA CHAPELLE GONAGUET
HE REACHED PARIS
WE HAVE JUST SEEN HIM AT MONTFERMEIL
HIS FIRST CARE ON ARRIVING IN PARIS HAD BEEN TO BUY MOURNING CLOTHES
FOR A LITTLE GIRL OF FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT YEARS OF AGE THEN TO PROCURE
A LODGING
THAT DONE HE HAD BETAKEN HIMSELF TO MONTFERMEIL
IT WILL
BE REMEMBERED THAT ALREADY DURING HIS PRECEDING ESCAPE HE HAD MADE A
MYSTERIOUS TRIP THITHER OR SOMEWHERE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD OF WHICH THE
LAW HAD GATHERED AN INKLING
HOWEVER HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE DEAD AND THIS STILL FURTHER INCREASED THE
OBSCURITY WHICH HAD GATHERED ABOUT HIM
AT PARIS ONE OF THE JOURNALS
WHICH CHRONICLED THE FACT FELL INTO HIS HANDS
HE FELT REASSURED AND
ALMOST AT PEACE AS THOUGH HE HAD REALLY BEEN DEAD
ON THE EVENING OF THE DAY WHEN JEAN VALJEAN RESCUED COSETTE FROM THE
CLAWS OF THE THENARDIERS HE RETURNED TO PARIS
HE RE ENTERED IT AT
NIGHTFALL WITH THE CHILD BY WAY OF THE BARRIER MONCEAUX
THERE
HE ENTERED A CABRIOLET WHICH TOOK HIM TO THE ESPLANADE OF THE
OBSERVATOIRE
THERE HE GOT OUT PAID THE COACHMAN TOOK COSETTE BY
THE HAND AND TOGETHER THEY DIRECTED THEIR STEPS THROUGH THE
DARKNESS THROUGH THE DESERTED STREETS WHICH ADJOIN THE OURCINE AND THE
GLACIERE TOWARDS THE BOULEVARD DE L'HOPITAL
THE DAY HAD BEEN STRANGE AND FILLED WITH EMOTIONS FOR COSETTE
THEY
HAD EATEN SOME BREAD AND CHEESE PURCHASED IN ISOLATED TAVERNS BEHIND
HEDGES THEY HAD CHANGED CARRIAGES FREQUENTLY THEY HAD TRAVELLED SHORT
DISTANCES ON FOOT
SHE MADE NO COMPLAINT BUT SHE WAS WEARY AND JEAN
VALJEAN PERCEIVED IT BY THE WAY SHE DRAGGED MORE AND MORE ON HIS HAND
AS SHE WALKED
HE TOOK HER ON HIS BACK
COSETTE WITHOUT LETTING GO
OF CATHERINE LAID HER HEAD ON JEAN VALJEAN'S SHOULDER AND THERE FELL
ASLEEP
BOOK FOURTH THE GORBEAU HOVEL
ILLUSTRATION THE GORBEAU HOVEL 2B3 10 GORBEAU HOUSE
CHAPTER I MASTER GORBEAU
FORTY YEARS AGO A RAMBLER WHO HAD VENTURED INTO THAT UNKNOWN COUNTRY OF
THE SALPETRIERE AND WHO HAD MOUNTED TO THE BARRIERE D'ITALIE BY WAY
OF THE BOULEVARD REACHED A POINT WHERE IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT PARIS
DISAPPEARED
IT WAS NO LONGER SOLITUDE FOR THERE WERE PASSERS BY IT
WAS NOT THE COUNTRY FOR THERE WERE HOUSES AND STREETS IT WAS NOT THE
CITY FOR THE STREETS HAD RUTS LIKE HIGHWAYS AND THE GRASS GREW IN
THEM IT WAS NOT A VILLAGE THE HOUSES WERE TOO LOFTY
WHAT WAS IT
THEN IT WAS AN INHABITED SPOT WHERE THERE WAS NO ONE IT WAS A DESERT
PLACE WHERE THERE WAS SOME ONE IT WAS A BOULEVARD OF THE GREAT CITY A
STREET OF PARIS MORE WILD AT NIGHT THAN THE FOREST MORE GLOOMY BY DAY
THAN A CEMETERY
IT WAS THE OLD QUARTER OF THE MARCHE AUX CHEVAUX
THE RAMBLER IF HE RISKED HIMSELF OUTSIDE THE FOUR DECREPIT WALLS OF
THIS MARCHE AUX CHEVAUX IF HE CONSENTED EVEN TO PASS BEYOND THE RUE DU
PETIT BANQUIER AFTER LEAVING ON HIS RIGHT A GARDEN PROTECTED BY HIGH
WALLS THEN A FIELD IN WHICH TAN BARK MILLS ROSE LIKE GIGANTIC BEAVER
HUTS THEN AN ENCLOSURE ENCUMBERED WITH TIMBER WITH A HEAP OF STUMPS
SAWDUST AND SHAVINGS ON WHICH STOOD A LARGE DOG BARKING THEN A LONG
LOW UTTERLY DILAPIDATED WALL WITH A LITTLE BLACK DOOR IN MOURNING
LADEN WITH MOSSES WHICH WERE COVERED WITH FLOWERS IN THE SPRING THEN
IN THE MOST DESERTED SPOT A FRIGHTFUL AND DECREPIT BUILDING ON WHICH
RAN THE INSCRIPTION IN LARGE LETTERS POST NO BILLS THIS DARING
RAMBLER WOULD HAVE REACHED LITTLE KNOWN LATITUDES AT THE CORNER OF THE
RUE DES VIGNES SAINT MARCEL
THERE NEAR A FACTORY AND BETWEEN TWO
GARDEN WALLS THERE COULD BE SEEN AT THAT EPOCH A MEAN BUILDING
WHICH AT THE FIRST GLANCE SEEMED AS SMALL AS A THATCHED HOVEL AND
WHICH WAS IN REALITY AS LARGE AS A CATHEDRAL
IT PRESENTED ITS SIDE
AND GABLE TO THE PUBLIC ROAD HENCE ITS APPARENT DIMINUTIVENESS
NEARLY
THE WHOLE OF THE HOUSE WAS HIDDEN
ONLY THE DOOR AND ONE WINDOW COULD BE
SEEN
THIS HOVEL WAS ONLY ONE STORY HIGH
THE FIRST DETAIL THAT STRUCK THE OBSERVER WAS THAT THE DOOR COULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN ANYTHING BUT THE DOOR OF A HOVEL WHILE THE WINDOW IF IT
HAD BEEN CARVED OUT OF DRESSED STONE INSTEAD OF BEING IN ROUGH MASONRY
MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LATTICE OF A LORDLY MANSION
THE DOOR WAS NOTHING BUT A COLLECTION OF WORM EATEN PLANKS ROUGHLY BOUND
TOGETHER BY CROSS BEAMS WHICH RESEMBLED ROUGHLY HEWN LOGS
IT
OPENED DIRECTLY ON A STEEP STAIRCASE OF LOFTY STEPS MUDDY CHALKY
PLASTER STAINED DUSTY STEPS OF THE SAME WIDTH AS ITSELF WHICH
COULD BE SEEN FROM THE STREET RUNNING STRAIGHT UP LIKE A LADDER AND
DISAPPEARING IN THE DARKNESS BETWEEN TWO WALLS
THE TOP OF THE SHAPELESS
BAY INTO WHICH THIS DOOR SHUT WAS MASKED BY A NARROW SCANTLING IN THE
CENTRE OF WHICH A TRIANGULAR HOLE HAD BEEN SAWED WHICH SERVED BOTH AS
WICKET AND AIR HOLE WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
ON THE INSIDE OF THE
DOOR THE FIGURES 52 HAD BEEN TRACED WITH A COUPLE OF STROKES OF A BRUSH
DIPPED IN INK AND ABOVE THE SCANTLING THE SAME HAND HAD DAUBED THE
NUMBER 50 SO THAT ONE HESITATED
WHERE WAS ONE ABOVE THE DOOR IT SAID
NUMBER 50 THE INSIDE REPLIED NO NUMBER 52 NO ONE KNOWS WHAT
DUST COLORED FIGURES WERE SUSPENDED LIKE DRAPERIES FROM THE TRIANGULAR
OPENING
THE WINDOW WAS LARGE SUFFICIENTLY ELEVATED GARNISHED WITH VENETIAN
BLINDS AND WITH A FRAME IN LARGE SQUARE PANES ONLY THESE LARGE PANES
WERE SUFFERING FROM VARIOUS WOUNDS WHICH WERE BOTH CONCEALED AND
BETRAYED BY AN INGENIOUS PAPER BANDAGE
AND THE BLINDS DISLOCATED AND
UNPASTED THREATENED PASSERS BY RATHER THAN SCREENED THE OCCUPANTS
THE HORIZONTAL SLATS WERE MISSING HERE AND THERE AND HAD BEEN NAIVELY
REPLACED WITH BOARDS NAILED ON PERPENDICULARLY SO THAT WHAT BEGAN AS
A BLIND ENDED AS A SHUTTER
THIS DOOR WITH AN UNCLEAN AND THIS WINDOW
WITH AN HONEST THOUGH DILAPIDATED AIR THUS BEHELD ON THE SAME HOUSE
PRODUCED THE EFFECT OF TWO INCOMPLETE BEGGARS WALKING SIDE BY SIDE
WITH DIFFERENT MIENS BENEATH THE SAME RAGS THE ONE HAVING ALWAYS BEEN A
MENDICANT AND THE OTHER HAVING ONCE BEEN A GENTLEMAN
THE STAIRCASE LED TO A VERY VAST EDIFICE WHICH RESEMBLED A SHED WHICH
HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO A HOUSE
THIS EDIFICE HAD FOR ITS INTESTINAL
TUBE A LONG CORRIDOR ON WHICH OPENED TO RIGHT AND LEFT SORTS OF
COMPARTMENTS OF VARIED DIMENSIONS WHICH WERE INHABITABLE UNDER STRESS
OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND RATHER MORE LIKE STALLS THAN CELLS
THESE CHAMBERS
RECEIVED THEIR LIGHT FROM THE VAGUE WASTE GROUNDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
ALL THIS WAS DARK DISAGREEABLE WAN MELANCHOLY SEPULCHRAL TRAVERSED
ACCORDING AS THE CREVICES LAY IN THE ROOF OR IN THE DOOR BY COLD RAYS
OR BY ICY WINDS
AN INTERESTING AND PICTURESQUE PECULIARITY OF THIS SORT
OF DWELLING IS THE ENORMOUS SIZE OF THE SPIDERS
TO THE LEFT OF THE ENTRANCE DOOR ON THE BOULEVARD SIDE AT ABOUT THE
HEIGHT OF A MAN FROM THE GROUND A SMALL WINDOW WHICH HAD BEEN WALLED UP
FORMED A SQUARE NICHE FULL OF STONES WHICH THE CHILDREN HAD THROWN THERE
AS THEY PASSED BY
A PORTION OF THIS BUILDING HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEMOLISHED
FROM WHAT STILL
REMAINS OF IT ONE CAN FORM A JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT IT WAS IN FORMER DAYS
AS A WHOLE IT WAS NOT OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD
A HUNDRED YEARS IS
YOUTH IN A CHURCH AND AGE IN A HOUSE
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH MAN'S LODGING
PARTOOK OF HIS EPHEMERAL CHARACTER AND GOD'S HOUSE OF HIS ETERNITY
THE POSTMEN CALLED THE HOUSE NUMBER 50 52 BUT IT WAS KNOWN IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD AS THE GORBEAU HOUSE
LET US EXPLAIN WHENCE THIS APPELLATION WAS DERIVED
COLLECTORS OF PETTY DETAILS WHO BECOME HERBALISTS OF ANECDOTES AND
PRICK SLIPPERY DATES INTO THEIR MEMORIES WITH A PIN KNOW THAT THERE
WAS IN PARIS DURING THE LAST CENTURY ABOUT 1770 TWO ATTORNEYS AT THE
CHATELET NAMED ONE CORBEAU RAVEN THE OTHER RENARD FOX
THE TWO
NAMES HAD BEEN FORESTALLED BY LA FONTAINE
THE OPPORTUNITY WAS TOO FINE
FOR THE LAWYERS THEY MADE THE MOST OF IT
A PARODY WAS IMMEDIATELY
PUT IN CIRCULATION IN THE GALLERIES OF THE COURT HOUSE IN VERSES THAT
LIMPED A LITTLE
MAITRE CORBEAU SUR UN DOSSIER PERCHE 13
TENAIT DANS SON BEE UNE SAISIE EXECUTOIRE
MAITRE RENARD PAR L'ODEUR ALLECHE
LUI FIT A PEU PRES CETTE HISTOIRE
HE BONJOUR
ETC
THE TWO HONEST PRACTITIONERS EMBARRASSED BY THE JESTS AND FINDING THE
BEARING OF THEIR HEADS INTERFERED WITH BY THE SHOUTS OF LAUGHTER WHICH
FOLLOWED THEM RESOLVED TO GET RID OF THEIR NAMES AND HIT UPON THE
EXPEDIENT OF APPLYING TO THE KING
THEIR PETITION WAS PRESENTED TO LOUIS XV
ON THE SAME DAY WHEN THE
PAPAL NUNCIO ON THE ONE HAND AND THE CARDINAL DE LA ROCHE AYMON ON THE
OTHER BOTH DEVOUTLY KNEELING WERE EACH ENGAGED IN PUTTING ON IN HIS
MAJESTY'S PRESENCE A SLIPPER ON THE BARE FEET OF MADAME DU BARRY WHO
HAD JUST GOT OUT OF BED
THE KING WHO WAS LAUGHING CONTINUED TO LAUGH
PASSED GAYLY FROM THE TWO BISHOPS TO THE TWO LAWYERS AND BESTOWED ON
THESE LIMBS OF THE LAW THEIR FORMER NAMES OR NEARLY SO
BY THE KINGS
COMMAND MAITRE CORBEAU WAS PERMITTED TO ADD A TAIL TO HIS INITIAL
LETTER AND TO CALL HIMSELF GORBEAU
MAITRE RENARD WAS LESS LUCKY ALL HE
OBTAINED WAS LEAVE TO PLACE A P IN FRONT OF HIS R AND TO CALL HIMSELF
PRENARD SO THAT THE SECOND NAME BORE ALMOST AS MUCH RESEMBLANCE AS THE
FIRST
NOW ACCORDING TO LOCAL TRADITION THIS MAITRE GORBEAU HAD BEEN THE
PROPRIETOR OF THE BUILDING NUMBERED 50 52 ON THE BOULEVARD DE L'HOPITAL
HE WAS EVEN THE AUTHOR OF THE MONUMENTAL WINDOW
HENCE THE EDIFICE BORE THE NAME OF THE GORBEAU HOUSE
OPPOSITE THIS HOUSE AMONG THE TREES OF THE BOULEVARD ROSE A GREAT ELM
WHICH WAS THREE QUARTERS DEAD ALMOST DIRECTLY FACING IT OPENS THE RUE
DE LA BARRIERE DES GOBELINS A STREET THEN WITHOUT HOUSES UNPAVED
PLANTED WITH UNHEALTHY TREES WHICH WAS GREEN OR MUDDY ACCORDING TO THE
SEASON AND WHICH ENDED SQUARELY IN THE EXTERIOR WALL OF PARIS
AN ODOR
OF COPPERAS ISSUED IN PUFFS FROM THE ROOFS OF THE NEIGHBORING FACTORY
THE BARRIER WAS CLOSE AT HAND
IN 1823 THE CITY WALL WAS STILL IN
EXISTENCE
THIS BARRIER ITSELF EVOKED GLOOMY FANCIES IN THE MIND
IT WAS THE
ROAD TO BICETRE
IT WAS THROUGH IT THAT UNDER THE EMPIRE AND THE
RESTORATION PRISONERS CONDEMNED TO DEATH RE ENTERED PARIS ON THE DAY
OF THEIR EXECUTION
IT WAS THERE THAT ABOUT 1829 WAS COMMITTED THAT
MYSTERIOUS ASSASSINATION CALLED THE ASSASSINATION OF THE FONTAINEBLEAU
BARRIER WHOSE AUTHORS JUSTICE WAS NEVER ABLE TO DISCOVER A MELANCHOLY
PROBLEM WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN ELUCIDATED A FRIGHTFUL ENIGMA WHICH HAS
NEVER BEEN UNRIDDLED
TAKE A FEW STEPS AND YOU COME UPON THAT FATAL RUE
CROULEBARBE WHERE ULBACH STABBED THE GOAT GIRL OF IVRY TO THE SOUND OF
THUNDER AS IN THE MELODRAMAS
A FEW PACES MORE AND YOU ARRIVE AT THE
ABOMINABLE POLLARDED ELMS OF THE BARRIERE SAINT JACQUES THAT EXPEDIENT
OF THE PHILANTHROPIST TO CONCEAL THE SCAFFOLD THAT MISERABLE AND
SHAMEFUL PLACE DE GROVE OF A SHOP KEEPING AND BOURGEOIS SOCIETY WHICH
RECOILED BEFORE THE DEATH PENALTY NEITHER DARING TO ABOLISH IT WITH
GRANDEUR NOR TO UPHOLD IT WITH AUTHORITY
LEAVING ASIDE THIS PLACE SAINT JACQUES WHICH WAS AS IT WERE
PREDESTINED AND WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN HORRIBLE PROBABLY THE MOST
MOURNFUL SPOT ON THAT MOURNFUL BOULEVARD SEVEN AND THIRTY YEARS AGO
WAS THE SPOT WHICH EVEN TO DAY IS SO UNATTRACTIVE WHERE STOOD THE
BUILDING NUMBER 50 52
BOURGEOIS HOUSES ONLY BEGAN TO SPRING UP THERE TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER
THE PLACE WAS UNPLEASANT
IN ADDITION TO THE GLOOMY THOUGHTS WHICH
ASSAILED ONE THERE ONE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING BETWEEN THE SALPETRIERE
A GLIMPSE OF WHOSE DOME COULD BE SEEN AND BICETRE WHOSE OUTSKIRTS ONE
WAS FAIRLY TOUCHING THAT IS TO SAY BETWEEN THE MADNESS OF WOMEN AND
THE MADNESS OF MEN
AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE ONE COULD PERCEIVE
NOTHING BUT THE ABATTOIRS THE CITY WALL AND THE FRONTS OF A FEW
FACTORIES RESEMBLING BARRACKS OR MONASTERIES EVERYWHERE ABOUT STOOD
HOVELS RUBBISH ANCIENT WALLS BLACKENED LIKE CERECLOTHS NEW WHITE
WALLS LIKE WINDING SHEETS EVERYWHERE PARALLEL ROWS OF TREES BUILDINGS
ERECTED ON A LINE FLAT CONSTRUCTIONS LONG COLD ROWS AND THE
MELANCHOLY SADNESS OF RIGHT ANGLES
NOT AN UNEVENNESS OF THE GROUND
NOT A CAPRICE IN THE ARCHITECTURE NOT A FOLD
THE ENSEMBLE WAS GLACIAL
REGULAR HIDEOUS
NOTHING OPPRESSES THE HEART LIKE SYMMETRY
IT IS
BECAUSE SYMMETRY IS ENNUI AND ENNUI IS AT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF GRIEF
DESPAIR YAWNS
SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE THAN A HELL WHERE ONE SUFFERS
MAY BE IMAGINED AND THAT IS A HELL WHERE ONE IS BORED
IF SUCH A HELL
EXISTED THAT BIT OF THE BOULEVARD DE L'HOPITAL MIGHT HAVE FORMED THE
ENTRANCE TO IT
NEVERTHELESS AT NIGHTFALL AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE DAYLIGHT IS
VANISHING ESPECIALLY IN WINTER AT THE HOUR WHEN THE TWILIGHT BREEZE
TEARS FROM THE ELMS THEIR LAST RUSSET LEAVES WHEN THE DARKNESS IS DEEP
AND STARLESS OR WHEN THE MOON AND THE WIND ARE MAKING OPENINGS IN THE
CLOUDS AND LOSING THEMSELVES IN THE SHADOWS THIS BOULEVARD SUDDENLY
BECOMES FRIGHTFUL
THE BLACK LINES SINK INWARDS AND ARE LOST IN THE
SHADES LIKE MORSELS OF THE INFINITE
THE PASSER BY CANNOT REFRAIN FROM
RECALLING THE INNUMERABLE TRADITIONS OF THE PLACE WHICH ARE CONNECTED
WITH THE GIBBET
THE SOLITUDE OF THIS SPOT WHERE SO MANY CRIMES HAVE
BEEN COMMITTED HAD SOMETHING TERRIBLE ABOUT IT
ONE ALMOST HAD A
PRESENTIMENT OF MEETING WITH TRAPS IN THAT DARKNESS ALL THE CONFUSED
FORMS OF THE DARKNESS SEEMED SUSPICIOUS AND THE LONG HOLLOW SQUARE OF
WHICH ONE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE BETWEEN EACH TREE SEEMED GRAVES BY DAY IT
WAS UGLY IN THE EVENING MELANCHOLY BY NIGHT IT WAS SINISTER
IN SUMMER AT TWILIGHT ONE SAW HERE AND THERE A FEW OLD WOMEN SEATED
AT THE FOOT OF THE ELM ON BENCHES MOULDY WITH RAIN
THESE GOOD OLD
WOMEN WERE FOND OF BEGGING
HOWEVER THIS QUARTER WHICH HAD A SUPERANNUATED RATHER THAN AN ANTIQUE
AIR WAS TENDING EVEN THEN TO TRANSFORMATION
EVEN AT THAT TIME ANY ONE
WHO WAS DESIROUS OF SEEING IT HAD TO MAKE HASTE
EACH DAY SOME DETAIL OF
THE WHOLE EFFECT WAS DISAPPEARING
FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE STATION
OF THE ORLEANS RAILWAY HAS STOOD BESIDE THE OLD FAUBOURG AND DISTRACTED
IT AS IT DOES TO DAY
WHEREVER IT IS PLACED ON THE BORDERS OF A
CAPITAL A RAILWAY STATION IS THE DEATH OF A SUBURB AND THE BIRTH OF A
CITY
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH AROUND THESE GREAT CENTRES OF THE MOVEMENTS OF
A PEOPLE THE EARTH FULL OF GERMS TREMBLED AND YAWNED TO ENGULF THE
ANCIENT DWELLINGS OF MEN AND TO ALLOW NEW ONES TO SPRING FORTH AT THE
RATTLE OF THESE POWERFUL MACHINES AT THE BREATH OF THESE MONSTROUS
HORSES OF CIVILIZATION WHICH DEVOUR COAL AND VOMIT FIRE
THE OLD HOUSES
CRUMBLE AND NEW ONES RISE
SINCE THE ORLEANS RAILWAY HAS INVADED THE REGION OF THE SALPETRIERE
THE ANCIENT NARROW STREETS WHICH ADJOIN THE MOATS SAINT VICTOR AND THE
JARDIN DES PLANTES TREMBLE AS THEY ARE VIOLENTLY TRAVERSED THREE OR
FOUR TIMES EACH DAY BY THOSE CURRENTS OF COACH FIACRES AND OMNIBUSES
WHICH IN A GIVEN TIME CROWD BACK THE HOUSES TO THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT
FOR THERE ARE THINGS WHICH ARE ODD WHEN SAID THAT ARE RIGOROUSLY EXACT
AND JUST AS IT IS TRUE TO SAY THAT IN LARGE CITIES THE SUN MAKES THE
SOUTHERN FRONTS OF HOUSES TO VEGETATE AND GROW IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE
FREQUENT PASSAGE OF VEHICLES ENLARGES STREETS
THE SYMPTOMS OF A NEW
LIFE ARE EVIDENT
IN THIS OLD PROVINCIAL QUARTER IN THE WILDEST NOOKS
THE PAVEMENT SHOWS ITSELF THE SIDEWALKS BEGIN TO CRAWL AND TO GROW
LONGER EVEN WHERE THERE ARE AS YET NO PEDESTRIANS
ONE MORNING A
MEMORABLE MORNING IN JULY 1845 BLACK POTS OF BITUMEN WERE SEEN
SMOKING THERE ON THAT DAY IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT CIVILIZATION HAD
ARRIVED IN THE RUE DE L'OURCINE AND THAT PARIS HAD ENTERED THE SUBURB
OF SAINT MARCEAU
CHAPTER II A NEST FOR OWL AND A WARBLER
IT WAS IN FRONT OF THIS GORBEAU HOUSE THAT JEAN VALJEAN HALTED
LIKE
WILD BIRDS HE HAD CHOSEN THIS DESERT PLACE TO CONSTRUCT HIS NEST
HE FUMBLED IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET DREW OUT A SORT OF A PASS KEY
OPENED THE DOOR ENTERED CLOSED IT AGAIN CAREFULLY AND ASCENDED THE
STAIRCASE STILL CARRYING COSETTE
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET ANOTHER KEY WITH
WHICH HE OPENED ANOTHER DOOR
THE CHAMBER WHICH HE ENTERED AND WHICH
HE CLOSED AGAIN INSTANTLY WAS A KIND OF MODERATELY SPACIOUS ATTIC
FURNISHED WITH A MATTRESS LAID ON THE FLOOR A TABLE AND SEVERAL
CHAIRS A STOVE IN WHICH A FIRE WAS BURNING AND WHOSE EMBERS WERE
VISIBLE STOOD IN ONE CORNER
A LANTERN ON THE BOULEVARD CAST A VAGUE
LIGHT INTO THIS POOR ROOM
AT THE EXTREME END THERE WAS A DRESSING ROOM
WITH A FOLDING BED JEAN VALJEAN CARRIED THE CHILD TO THIS BED AND LAID
HER DOWN THERE WITHOUT WAKING HER
HE STRUCK A MATCH AND LIGHTED A CANDLE
ALL THIS WAS PREPARED BEFOREHAND
ON THE TABLE AND AS HE HAD DONE ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HE BEGAN
TO SCRUTINIZE COSETTE'S FACE WITH A GAZE FULL OF ECSTASY IN WHICH THE
EXPRESSION OF KINDNESS AND TENDERNESS ALMOST AMOUNTED TO ABERRATION
THE
LITTLE GIRL WITH THAT TRANQUIL CONFIDENCE WHICH BELONGS ONLY TO EXTREME
STRENGTH AND EXTREME WEAKNESS HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WITHOUT KNOWING WITH
WHOM SHE WAS AND CONTINUED TO SLEEP WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE SHE WAS
JEAN VALJEAN BENT DOWN AND KISSED THAT CHILD'S HAND
NINE MONTHS BEFORE HE HAD KISSED THE HAND OF THE MOTHER WHO HAD ALSO
JUST FALLEN ASLEEP
THE SAME SAD PIERCING RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT FILLED HIS HEART
HE KNELT BESIDE COSETTE'S BED
LT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT AND THE CHILD STILL SLEPT
A WAN RAY OF THE
DECEMBER SUN PENETRATED THE WINDOW OF THE ATTIC AND LAY UPON THE
CEILING IN LONG THREADS OF LIGHT AND SHADE
ALL AT ONCE A HEAVILY LADEN
CARRIER'S CART WHICH WAS PASSING ALONG THE BOULEVARD SHOOK THE FRAIL
BED LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER AND MADE IT QUIVER FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
YES MADAME CRIED COSETTE WAKING WITH A START HERE I AM HERE I
AM
AND SHE SPRANG OUT OF BED HER EYES STILL HALF SHUT WITH THE HEAVINESS
OF SLEEP EXTENDING HER ARMS TOWARDS THE CORNER OF THE WALL
AH MON DIEU MY BROOM SAID SHE
SHE OPENED HER EYES WIDE NOW AND BEHELD THE SMILING COUNTENANCE OF JEAN
VALJEAN
AH SO IT IS TRUE SAID THE CHILD
GOOD MORNING MONSIEUR
CHILDREN ACCEPT JOY AND HAPPINESS INSTANTLY AND FAMILIARLY BEING
THEMSELVES BY NATURE JOY AND HAPPINESS
COSETTE CAUGHT SIGHT OF CATHERINE AT THE FOOT OF HER BED AND TOOK
POSSESSION OF HER AND AS SHE PLAYED SHE PUT A HUNDRED QUESTIONS TO
JEAN VALJEAN
WHERE WAS SHE WAS PARIS VERY LARGE WAS MADAME THENARDIER
VERY FAR AWAY WAS SHE TO GO BACK ETC ETC
ALL AT ONCE SHE EXCLAIMED
HOW PRETTY IT IS HERE
IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL HOLE BUT SHE FELT FREE
MUST I SWEEP SHE RESUMED AT LAST
PLAY SAID JEAN VALJEAN
THE DAY PASSED THUS
COSETTE WITHOUT TROUBLING HERSELF TO UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING WAS INEXPRESSIBLY HAPPY WITH THAT DOLL AND THAT KIND MAN
CHAPTER III TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE
ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT DAYBREAK JEAN VALJEAN WAS STILL BY
COSETTE'S BEDSIDE HE WATCHED THERE MOTIONLESS WAITING FOR HER TO WAKE
SOME NEW THING HAD COME INTO HIS SOUL
JEAN VALJEAN HAD NEVER LOVED ANYTHING FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS HE HAD BEEN
ALONE IN THE WORLD
HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND
IN
THE PRISON HE HAD BEEN VICIOUS GLOOMY CHASTE IGNORANT AND SHY
THE HEART OF THAT EX CONVICT WAS FULL OF VIRGINITY
HIS SISTER AND HIS
SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VAGUE AND FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH
HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO
FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM
HUMAN NATURE IS MADE THUS THE OTHER TENDER EMOTIONS OF HIS YOUTH IF HE
HAD EVER HAD ANY HAD FALLEN INTO AN ABYSS
WHEN HE SAW COSETTE WHEN HE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER CARRIED HER
OFF AND DELIVERED HER HE FELT HIS HEART MOVED WITHIN HIM
ALL THE PASSION AND AFFECTION WITHIN HIM AWOKE AND RUSHED TOWARDS THAT
CHILD
HE APPROACHED THE BED WHERE SHE LAY SLEEPING AND TREMBLED WITH
JOY
HE SUFFERED ALL THE PANGS OF A MOTHER AND HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT
MEANT FOR THAT GREAT AND SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF A HEART WHICH BEGINS TO
LOVE IS A VERY OBSCURE AND A VERY SWEET THING
POOR OLD MAN WITH A PERFECTLY NEW HEART
ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER
INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT
IT WAS THE SECOND WHITE APPARITION WHICH HE HAD ENCOUNTERED
THE BISHOP
HAD CAUSED THE DAWN OF VIRTUE TO RISE ON HIS HORIZON COSETTE CAUSED THE
DAWN OF LOVE TO RISE
THE EARLY DAYS PASSED IN THIS DAZZLED STATE
COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER
BEING POOR LITTLE THING SHE WAS SO LITTLE WHEN HER MOTHER LEFT HER
THAT SHE NO LONGER REMEMBERED HER
LIKE ALL CHILDREN WHO RESEMBLE YOUNG
SHOOTS OF THE VINE WHICH CLING TO EVERYTHING SHE HAD TRIED TO LOVE
SHE HAD NOT SUCCEEDED
ALL HAD REPULSED HER THE THENARDIERS THEIR
CHILDREN OTHER CHILDREN
SHE HAD LOVED THE DOG AND HE HAD DIED AFTER
WHICH NOTHING AND NOBODY WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER
IT IS A SAD
THING TO SAY AND WE HAVE ALREADY INTIMATED IT THAT AT EIGHT YEARS OF
AGE HER HEART WAS COLD
IT WAS NOT HER FAULT IT WAS NOT THE FACULTY
OF LOVING THAT SHE LACKED ALAS IT WAS THE POSSIBILITY
THUS FROM THE
VERY FIRST DAY ALL HER SENTIENT AND THINKING POWERS LOVED THIS KIND
MAN
SHE FELT THAT WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A SENSATION OF
EXPANSION
THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLD OR POOR SHE
THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HOVEL PRETTY
THESE ARE THE EFFECTS OF THE DAWN OF CHILDHOOD OF JOY
THE NOVELTY OF
THE EARTH AND OF LIFE COUNTS FOR SOMETHING HERE
NOTHING IS SO CHARMING
AS THE COLORING REFLECTION OF HAPPINESS ON A GARRET
WE ALL HAVE IN OUR
PAST A DELIGHTFUL GARRET
NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GULF BETWEEN
JEAN VALJEAN AND COSETTE DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GULF
DESTINY SUDDENLY
UNITED AND WEDDED WITH ITS IRRESISTIBLE POWER THESE TWO UPROOTED
EXISTENCES DIFFERING IN AGE ALIKE IN SORROW
ONE IN FACT COMPLETED
THE OTHER
COSETTE'S INSTINCT SOUGHT A FATHER AS JEAN VALJEAN'S
INSTINCT SOUGHT A CHILD
TO MEET WAS TO FIND EACH OTHER
AT THE
MYSTERIOUS MOMENT WHEN THEIR HANDS TOUCHED THEY WERE WELDED TOGETHER
WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS
NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY
TAKING THE WORDS IN THEIR MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND ABSOLUTE SENSE WE
MAY SAY THAT SEPARATED FROM EVERY ONE BY THE WALLS OF THE TOMB JEAN
VALJEAN WAS THE WIDOWER AND COSETTE WAS THE ORPHAN THIS SITUATION
CAUSED JEAN VALJEAN TO BECOME COSETTE'S FATHER AFTER A CELESTIAL
FASHION
AND IN TRUTH THE MYSTERIOUS IMPRESSION PRODUCED ON COSETTE IN THE
DEPTHS OF THE FOREST OF CHELLES BY THE HAND OF JEAN VALJEAN GRASPING
HERS IN THE DARK WAS NOT AN ILLUSION BUT A REALITY
THE ENTRANCE OF
THAT MAN INTO THE DESTINY OF THAT CHILD HAD BEEN THE ADVENT OF GOD
MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL
THERE HE SEEMED
PERFECTLY SECURE
THE CHAMBER WITH A DRESSING ROOM WHICH HE OCCUPIED WITH COSETTE WAS
THE ONE WHOSE WINDOW OPENED ON THE BOULEVARD
THIS BEING THE ONLY WINDOW
IN THE HOUSE NO NEIGHBORS' GLANCES WERE TO BE FEARED FROM ACROSS THE
WAY OR AT THE SIDE
THE GROUND FLOOR OF NUMBER 50 52 A SORT OF DILAPIDATED PENTHOUSE
SERVED AS A WAGON HOUSE FOR MARKET GARDENERS AND NO COMMUNICATION
EXISTED BETWEEN IT AND THE FIRST STORY
IT WAS SEPARATED BY THE
FLOORING WHICH HAD NEITHER TRAPS NOR STAIRS AND WHICH FORMED THE
DIAPHRAGM OF THE BUILDING AS IT WERE
THE FIRST STORY CONTAINED AS WE
HAVE SAID NUMEROUS CHAMBERS AND SEVERAL ATTICS ONLY ONE OF WHICH
WAS OCCUPIED BY THE OLD WOMAN WHO TOOK CHARGE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S
HOUSEKEEPING ALL THE REST WAS UNINHABITED
IT WAS THIS OLD WOMAN ORNAMENTED WITH THE NAME OF THE PRINCIPAL LODGER
AND IN REALITY INTRUSTED WITH THE FUNCTIONS OF PORTRESS WHO HAD LET
HIM THE LODGING ON CHRISTMAS EVE
HE HAD REPRESENTED HIMSELF TO HER AS A
GENTLEMAN OF MEANS WHO HAD BEEN RUINED BY SPANISH BONDS WHO WAS COMING
THERE TO LIVE WITH HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER
HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN
ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND
DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN
IT WAS THIS GOOD WOMAN WHO HAD LIGHTED
THE FIRE IN THE STOVE AND PREPARED EVERYTHING ON THE EVENING OF THEIR
ARRIVAL
WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK THESE TWO BEINGS LED A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HOVEL
COSETTE LAUGHED CHATTERED AND SANG FROM DAYBREAK
CHILDREN HAVE THEIR
MORNING SONG AS WELL AS BIRDS
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT JEAN VALJEAN CLASPED HER TINY RED HAND ALL
CRACKED WITH CHILBLAINS AND KISSED IT
THE POOR CHILD WHO WAS USED
TO BEING BEATEN DID NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF THIS AND RAN AWAY IN
CONFUSION
AT TIMES SHE BECAME SERIOUS AND STARED AT HER LITTLE BLACK GOWN
COSETTE
WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MOURNING
SHE HAD EMERGED FROM MISERY
AND SHE WAS ENTERING INTO LIFE
JEAN VALJEAN HAD UNDERTAKEN TO TEACH HER TO READ
SOMETIMES AS HE MADE
THE CHILD SPELL HE REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS WITH THE IDEA OF DOING EVIL
THAT HE HAD LEARNED TO READ IN PRISON
THIS IDEA HAD ENDED IN TEACHING A
CHILD TO READ
THEN THE EX CONVICT SMILED WITH THE PENSIVE SMILE OF THE
ANGELS
HE FELT IN IT A PREMEDITATION FROM ON HIGH THE WILL OF SOME ONE WHO
WAS NOT MAN AND HE BECAME ABSORBED IN REVERY
GOOD THOUGHTS HAVE THEIR
ABYSSES AS WELL AS EVIL ONES
TO TEACH COSETTE TO READ AND TO LET HER PLAY THIS CONSTITUTED NEARLY
THE WHOLE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S EXISTENCE
AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER
AND HE MADE HER PRAY
SHE CALLED HIM FATHER AND KNEW NO OTHER NAME FOR HIM
HE PASSED HOURS IN WATCHING HER DRESSING AND UNDRESSING HER DOLL AND IN
LISTENING TO HER PRATTLE
LIFE HENCEFORTH APPEARED TO HIM TO BE FULL
OF INTEREST MEN SEEMED TO HIM GOOD AND JUST HE NO LONGER REPROACHED
ANY ONE IN THOUGHT HE SAW NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT LIVE TO BE A VERY
OLD MAN NOW THAT THIS CHILD LOVED HIM
HE SAW A WHOLE FUTURE STRETCHING
OUT BEFORE HIM ILLUMINATED BY COSETTE AS BY A CHARMING LIGHT
THE BEST
OF US ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM EGOTISTICAL THOUGHTS
AT TIMES HE REFLECTED
WITH A SORT OF JOY THAT SHE WOULD BE UGLY
THIS IS ONLY A PERSONAL OPINION BUT TO UTTER OUR WHOLE THOUGHT AT THE
POINT WHERE JEAN VALJEAN HAD ARRIVED WHEN HE BEGAN TO LOVE COSETTE IT
IS BY NO MEANS CLEAR TO US THAT HE DID NOT NEED THIS ENCOURAGEMENT IN
ORDER THAT HE MIGHT PERSEVERE IN WELL DOING
HE HAD JUST VIEWED THE
MALICE OF MEN AND THE MISERY OF SOCIETY UNDER A NEW ASPECT INCOMPLETE
ASPECTS WHICH UNFORTUNATELY ONLY EXHIBITED ONE SIDE OF THE TRUTH
THE FATE OF WOMAN AS SUMMED UP IN FANTINE AND PUBLIC AUTHORITY AS
PERSONIFIED IN JAVERT
HE HAD RETURNED TO PRISON THIS TIME FOR HAVING
DONE RIGHT HE HAD QUAFFED FRESH BITTERNESS DISGUST AND LASSITUDE WERE
OVERPOWERING HIM EVEN THE MEMORY OF THE BISHOP PROBABLY SUFFERED
A TEMPORARY ECLIPSE THOUGH SURE TO REAPPEAR LATER ON LUMINOUS AND
TRIUMPHANT BUT AFTER ALL THAT SACRED MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM
WHO KNOWS WHETHER JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT BEEN ON THE EVE OF GROWING
DISCOURAGED AND OF FALLING ONCE MORE HE LOVED AND GREW STRONG AGAIN
ALAS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISION THAN COSETTE
HE PROTECTED HER
AND SHE STRENGTHENED HIM
THANKS TO HIM SHE COULD WALK THROUGH LIFE
THANKS TO HER HE COULD CONTINUE IN VIRTUE
HE WAS THAT CHILD'S STAY
AND SHE WAS HIS PROP
OH UNFATHOMABLE AND DIVINE MYSTERY OF THE
BALANCES OF DESTINY
CHAPTER IV THE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANT
JEAN VALJEAN WAS PRUDENT ENOUGH NEVER TO GO OUT BY DAY
EVERY EVENING
AT TWILIGHT HE WALKED FOR AN HOUR OR TWO SOMETIMES ALONE OFTEN WITH
COSETTE SEEKING THE MOST DESERTED SIDE ALLEYS OF THE BOULEVARD AND
ENTERING CHURCHES AT NIGHTFALL
HE LIKED TO GO TO SAINT MEDARD WHICH IS
THE NEAREST CHURCH
WHEN HE DID NOT TAKE COSETTE WITH HIM SHE REMAINED
WITH THE OLD WOMAN BUT THE CHILD'S DELIGHT WAS TO GO OUT WITH THE GOOD
MAN
SHE PREFERRED AN HOUR WITH HIM TO ALL HER RAPTUROUS TETE A TETES
WITH CATHERINE
HE HELD HER HAND AS THEY WALKED AND SAID SWEET THINGS
TO HER
IT TURNED OUT THAT COSETTE WAS A VERY GAY LITTLE PERSON
THE OLD WOMAN ATTENDED TO THE HOUSEKEEPING AND COOKING AND WENT TO
MARKET
THEY LIVED SOBERLY ALWAYS HAVING A LITTLE FIRE BUT LIKE PEOPLE IN
VERY MODERATE CIRCUMSTANCES
JEAN VALJEAN HAD MADE NO ALTERATIONS IN
THE FURNITURE AS IT WAS THE FIRST DAY HE HAD MERELY HAD THE GLASS DOOR
LEADING TO COSETTE'S DRESSING ROOM REPLACED BY A SOLID DOOR
HE STILL WORE HIS YELLOW COAT HIS BLACK BREECHES AND HIS OLD HAT
IN THE STREET HE WAS TAKEN FOR A POOR MAN
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT
KIND HEARTED WOMEN TURNED BACK TO BESTOW A SOU ON HIM
JEAN VALJEAN
ACCEPTED THE SOU WITH A DEEP BOW
IT ALSO HAPPENED OCCASIONALLY THAT HE
ENCOUNTERED SOME POOR WRETCH ASKING ALMS THEN HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM
TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS OBSERVING HIM STEALTHILY APPROACHED THE
UNFORTUNATE MAN PUT A PIECE OF MONEY INTO HIS HAND OFTEN A SILVER
COIN AND WALKED RAPIDLY AWAY
THIS HAD ITS DISADVANTAGES
HE BEGAN
TO BE KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD UNDER THE NAME OF THE BEGGAR WHO GIVES
ALMS
THE OLD PRINCIPAL LODGER A CROSS LOOKING CREATURE WHO WAS
THOROUGHLY PERMEATED SO FAR AS HER NEIGHBORS WERE CONCERNED WITH THE
INQUISITIVENESS PECULIAR TO ENVIOUS PERSONS SCRUTINIZED JEAN VALJEAN
A GREAT DEAL WITHOUT HIS SUSPECTING THE FACT
SHE WAS A LITTLE DEAF
WHICH RENDERED HER TALKATIVE
THERE REMAINED TO HER FROM HER PAST TWO
TEETH ONE ABOVE THE OTHER BELOW WHICH SHE WAS CONTINUALLY KNOCKING
AGAINST EACH OTHER
SHE HAD QUESTIONED COSETTE WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABLE
TO TELL HER ANYTHING SINCE SHE KNEW NOTHING HERSELF EXCEPT THAT SHE HAD
COME FROM MONTFERMEIL
ONE MORNING THIS SPY SAW JEAN VALJEAN WITH
AN AIR WHICH STRUCK THE OLD GOSSIP AS PECULIAR ENTERING ONE OF THE
UNINHABITED COMPARTMENTS OF THE HOVEL
SHE FOLLOWED HIM WITH THE STEP
OF AN OLD CAT AND WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE HIM WITHOUT BEING SEEN THROUGH A
CRACK IN THE DOOR WHICH WAS DIRECTLY OPPOSITE HIM
JEAN VALJEAN HAD HIS
BACK TURNED TOWARDS THIS DOOR BY WAY OF GREATER SECURITY NO DOUBT
THE
OLD WOMAN SAW HIM FUMBLE IN HIS POCKET AND DRAW THENCE A CASE SCISSORS
AND THREAD THEN HE BEGAN TO RIP THE LINING OF ONE OF THE SKIRTS OF HIS
COAT AND FROM THE OPENING HE TOOK A BIT OF YELLOWISH PAPER WHICH HE
UNFOLDED
THE OLD WOMAN RECOGNIZED WITH TERROR THE FACT THAT IT WAS
A BANK BILL FOR A THOUSAND FRANCS
IT WAS THE SECOND OR THIRD ONLY THAT
SHE HAD SEEN IN THE COURSE OF HER EXISTENCE
SHE FLED IN ALARM
A MOMENT LATER JEAN VALJEAN ACCOSTED HER AND ASKED HER TO GO AND
GET THIS THOUSAND FRANC BILL CHANGED FOR HIM ADDING THAT IT WAS HIS
QUARTERLY INCOME WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED THE DAY BEFORE
WHERE THOUGHT
THE OLD WOMAN
HE DID NOT GO OUT UNTIL SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING AND
THE GOVERNMENT BANK CERTAINLY IS NOT OPEN AT THAT HOUR THE OLD
WOMAN WENT TO GET THE BILL CHANGED AND MENTIONED HER SURMISES
THAT
THOUSAND FRANC NOTE COMMENTED ON AND MULTIPLIED PRODUCED A VAST
AMOUNT OF TERRIFIED DISCUSSION AMONG THE GOSSIPS OF THE RUE DES VIGNES
SAINT MARCEL
A FEW DAYS LATER IT CHANCED THAT JEAN VALJEAN WAS SAWING SOME WOOD IN
HIS SHIRT SLEEVES IN THE CORRIDOR
THE OLD WOMAN WAS IN THE CHAMBER
PUTTING THINGS IN ORDER
SHE WAS ALONE
COSETTE WAS OCCUPIED IN ADMIRING
THE WOOD AS IT WAS SAWED
THE OLD WOMAN CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE COAT HANGING
ON A NAIL AND EXAMINED IT
THE LINING HAD BEEN SEWED UP AGAIN
THE GOOD
WOMAN FELT OF IT CAREFULLY AND THOUGHT SHE OBSERVED IN THE SKIRTS AND
REVERS THICKNESSES OF PAPER
MORE THOUSAND FRANC BANK BILLS NO DOUBT
SHE ALSO NOTICED THAT THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN THE POCKETS
NOT ONLY THE NEEDLES THREAD AND SCISSORS WHICH SHE HAD SEEN BUT A BIG
POCKET BOOK A VERY LARGE KNIFE AND A SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE SEVERAL
WIGS OF VARIOUS COLORS
EACH POCKET OF THIS COAT HAD THE AIR OF BEING IN
A MANNER PROVIDED AGAINST UNEXPECTED ACCIDENTS
THUS THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE REACHED THE LAST DAYS OF WINTER
CHAPTER V A FIVE FRANC PIECE FALLS ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TUMULT
NEAR SAINT MEDARD'S CHURCH THERE WAS A POOR MAN WHO WAS IN THE HABIT OF
CROUCHING ON THE BRINK OF A PUBLIC WELL WHICH HAD BEEN CONDEMNED AND
ON WHOM JEAN VALJEAN WAS FOND OF BESTOWING CHARITY
HE NEVER PASSED THIS
MAN WITHOUT GIVING HIM A FEW SOUS
SOMETIMES HE SPOKE TO HIM
THOSE WHO
ENVIED THIS MENDICANT SAID THAT HE BELONGED TO THE POLICE
HE WAS AN
EX BEADLE OF SEVENTY FIVE WHO WAS CONSTANTLY MUMBLING HIS PRAYERS
ONE EVENING AS JEAN VALJEAN WAS PASSING BY WHEN HE HAD NOT COSETTE
WITH HIM HE SAW THE BEGGAR IN HIS USUAL PLACE BENEATH THE LANTERN
WHICH HAD JUST BEEN LIGHTED
THE MAN SEEMED ENGAGED IN PRAYER ACCORDING
TO HIS CUSTOM AND WAS MUCH BENT OVER
JEAN VALJEAN STEPPED UP TO HIM
AND PLACED HIS CUSTOMARY ALMS IN HIS HAND
THE MENDICANT RAISED HIS
EYES SUDDENLY STARED INTENTLY AT JEAN VALJEAN THEN DROPPED HIS HEAD
QUICKLY
THIS MOVEMENT WAS LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING
JEAN VALJEAN WAS
SEIZED WITH A SHUDDER
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD JUST CAUGHT SIGHT
BY THE LIGHT OF THE STREET LANTERN NOT OF THE PLACID AND BEAMING
VISAGE OF THE OLD BEADLE BUT OF A WELL KNOWN AND STARTLING FACE
HE
EXPERIENCED THE SAME IMPRESSION THAT ONE WOULD HAVE ON FINDING ONE'S
SELF ALL OF A SUDDEN FACE TO FACE IN THE DARK WITH A TIGER
HE
RECOILED TERRIFIED PETRIFIED DARING NEITHER TO BREATHE TO SPEAK
TO REMAIN NOR TO FLEE STARING AT THE BEGGAR WHO HAD DROPPED HIS HEAD
WHICH WAS ENVELOPED IN A RAG AND NO LONGER APPEARED TO KNOW THAT HE
WAS THERE
AT THIS STRANGE MOMENT AN INSTINCT POSSIBLY THE MYSTERIOUS
INSTINCT OF SELF PRESERVATION RESTRAINED JEAN VALJEAN FROM UTTERING A
WORD
THE BEGGAR HAD THE SAME FIGURE THE SAME RAGS THE SAME APPEARANCE
AS HE HAD EVERY DAY
BAH SAID JEAN VALJEAN I AM MAD I AM DREAMING
IMPOSSIBLE AND HE RETURNED PROFOUNDLY TROUBLED
HE HARDLY DARED TO CONFESS EVEN TO HIMSELF THAT THE FACE WHICH HE
THOUGHT HE HAD SEEN WAS THE FACE OF JAVERT
THAT NIGHT ON THINKING THE MATTER OVER HE REGRETTED NOT HAVING
QUESTIONED THE MAN IN ORDER TO FORCE HIM TO RAISE HIS HEAD A SECOND
TIME
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT NIGHTFALL HE WENT BACK
THE BEGGAR WAS AT HIS
POST
GOOD DAY MY GOOD MAN SAID JEAN VALJEAN RESOLUTELY HANDING
HIM A SOU
THE BEGGAR RAISED HIS HEAD AND REPLIED IN A WHINING VOICE
THANKS MY GOOD SIR IT WAS UNMISTAKABLY THE EX BEADLE
JEAN VALJEAN FELT COMPLETELY REASSURED
HE BEGAN TO LAUGH
HOW THE
DEUCE COULD I HAVE THOUGHT THAT I SAW JAVERT THERE HE THOUGHT
AM I
GOING TO LOSE MY EYESIGHT NOW AND HE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT
A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE
EVENING HE WAS IN HIS ROOM AND ENGAGED IN MAKING COSETTE SPELL ALOUD
WHEN HE HEARD THE HOUSE DOOR OPEN AND THEN SHUT AGAIN
THIS STRUCK HIM
AS SINGULAR
THE OLD WOMAN WHO WAS THE ONLY INHABITANT OF THE HOUSE
EXCEPT HIMSELF ALWAYS WENT TO BED AT NIGHTFALL SO THAT SHE MIGHT NOT
BURN OUT HER CANDLES
JEAN VALJEAN MADE A SIGN TO COSETTE TO BE QUIET
HE HEARD SOME ONE ASCENDING THE STAIRS
IT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE THE OLD
WOMAN WHO MIGHT HAVE FALLEN ILL AND HAVE BEEN OUT TO THE APOTHECARY'S
JEAN VALJEAN LISTENED
THE STEP WAS HEAVY AND SOUNDED LIKE THAT OF A MAN BUT THE OLD WOMAN
WORE STOUT SHOES AND THERE IS NOTHING WHICH SO STRONGLY RESEMBLES THE
STEP OF A MAN AS THAT OF AN OLD WOMAN
NEVERTHELESS JEAN VALJEAN BLEW
OUT HIS CANDLE
HE HAD SENT COSETTE TO BED SAYING TO HER IN A LOW VOICE GET INTO BED
VERY SOFTLY AND AS HE KISSED HER BROW THE STEPS PAUSED
JEAN VALJEAN REMAINED SILENT MOTIONLESS WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THE
DOOR SEATED ON THE CHAIR FROM WHICH HE HAD NOT STIRRED AND HOLDING HIS
BREATH IN THE DARK
AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A RATHER LONG INTERVAL HE TURNED ROUND AS HE
HEARD NOTHING MORE AND AS HE RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE DOOR OF HIS
CHAMBER HE SAW A LIGHT THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
THIS LIGHT FORMED A SORT
OF SINISTER STAR IN THE BLACKNESS OF THE DOOR AND THE WALL
THERE WAS
EVIDENTLY SOME ONE THERE WHO WAS HOLDING A CANDLE IN HIS HAND AND
LISTENING
SEVERAL MINUTES ELAPSED THUS AND THE LIGHT RETREATED
BUT HE HEARD NO
SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD
BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR HAD REMOVED HIS SHOES
JEAN VALJEAN THREW HIMSELF ALL DRESSED AS HE WAS ON HIS BED AND COULD
NOT CLOSE HIS EYES ALL NIGHT
AT DAYBREAK JUST AS HE WAS FALLING INTO A DOZE THROUGH FATIGUE HE WAS
AWAKENED BY THE CREAKING OF A DOOR WHICH OPENED ON SOME ATTIC AT THE
END OF THE CORRIDOR THEN HE HEARD THE SAME MASCULINE FOOTSTEP WHICH HAD
ASCENDED THE STAIRS ON THE PRECEDING EVENING
THE STEP WAS APPROACHING
HE SPRANG OFF THE BED AND APPLIED HIS EYE TO THE KEYHOLE WHICH WAS
TOLERABLY LARGE HOPING TO SEE THE PERSON WHO HAD MADE HIS WAY BY NIGHT
INTO THE HOUSE AND HAD LISTENED AT HIS DOOR AS HE PASSED
IT WAS A
MAN IN FACT WHO PASSED THIS TIME WITHOUT PAUSING IN FRONT OF JEAN
VALJEAN'S CHAMBER
THE CORRIDOR WAS TOO DARK TO ALLOW OF THE PERSON'S
FACE BEING DISTINGUISHED BUT WHEN THE MAN REACHED THE STAIRCASE A
RAY OF LIGHT FROM WITHOUT MADE IT STAND OUT LIKE A SILHOUETTE AND JEAN
VALJEAN HAD A COMPLETE VIEW OF HIS BACK
THE MAN WAS OF LOFTY STATURE
CLAD IN A LONG FROCK COAT WITH A CUDGEL UNDER HIS ARM
THE FORMIDABLE
NECK AND SHOULDERS BELONGED TO JAVERT
JEAN VALJEAN MIGHT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CATCH ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIM
THROUGH HIS WINDOW OPENING ON THE BOULEVARD BUT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
OBLIGED TO OPEN THE WINDOW HE DARED NOT
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THIS MAN HAD ENTERED WITH A KEY AND LIKE HIMSELF
WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THAT KEY WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THIS
WHEN THE OLD WOMAN CAME TO DO THE WORK AT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
JEAN VALJEAN CAST A PENETRATING GLANCE ON HER BUT HE DID NOT QUESTION
HER
THE GOOD WOMAN APPEARED AS USUAL
AS SHE SWEPT UP SHE REMARKED TO HIM
POSSIBLY MONSIEUR MAY HAVE HEARD SOME ONE COME IN LAST NIGHT
AT THAT AGE AND ON THAT BOULEVARD EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING WAS THE
DEAD OF THE NIGHT
THAT IS TRUE BY THE WAY HE REPLIED IN THE MOST NATURAL TONE
POSSIBLE
WHO WAS IT
IT WAS A NEW LODGER WHO HAS COME INTO THE HOUSE SAID THE OLD WOMAN
AND WHAT IS HIS NAME
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY DUMONT OR DAUMONT OR SOME NAME OF THAT SORT
AND WHO IS THIS MONSIEUR DUMONT
THE OLD WOMAN GAZED AT HIM WITH HER LITTLE POLECAT EYES AND ANSWERED
A GENTLEMAN OF PROPERTY LIKE YOURSELF
PERHAPS SHE HAD NO ULTERIOR MEANING
JEAN VALJEAN THOUGHT HE PERCEIVED
ONE
WHEN THE OLD WOMAN HAD TAKEN HER DEPARTURE HE DID UP A HUNDRED FRANCS
WHICH HE HAD IN A CUPBOARD INTO A ROLL AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET
IN
SPITE OF ALL THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH HE TOOK IN THIS OPERATION SO THAT HE
MIGHT NOT BE HEARD RATTLING SILVER A HUNDRED SOU PIECE ESCAPED FROM HIS
HANDS AND ROLLED NOISILY ON THE FLOOR
WHEN DARKNESS CAME ON HE DESCENDED AND CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED BOTH SIDES
OF THE BOULEVARD
HE SAW NO ONE
THE BOULEVARD APPEARED TO BE ABSOLUTELY
DESERTED
IT IS TRUE THAT A PERSON CAN CONCEAL HIMSELF BEHIND TREES
HE WENT UP STAIRS AGAIN
COME HE SAID TO COSETTE
HE TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND THEY BOTH WENT OUT
BOOK FIFTH FOR A BLACK HUNT A MUTE PACK
CHAPTER I THE ZIGZAGS OF STRATEGY
AN OBSERVATION HERE BECOMES NECESSARY IN VIEW OF THE PAGES WHICH THE
READER IS ABOUT TO PERUSE AND OF OTHERS WHICH WILL BE MET WITH FURTHER
ON
THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK WHO REGRETS THE NECESSITY OF MENTIONING
HIMSELF HAS BEEN ABSENT FROM PARIS FOR MANY YEARS
PARIS HAS BEEN
TRANSFORMED SINCE HE QUITTED IT
A NEW CITY HAS ARISEN WHICH IS AFTER
A FASHION UNKNOWN TO HIM
THERE IS NO NEED FOR HIM TO SAY THAT HE LOVES
PARIS PARIS IS HIS MIND'S NATAL CITY
IN CONSEQUENCE OF DEMOLITIONS AND
RECONSTRUCTIONS THE PARIS OF HIS YOUTH THAT PARIS WHICH HE BORE AWAY
RELIGIOUSLY IN HIS MEMORY IS NOW A PARIS OF DAYS GONE BY
HE MUST
BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK OF THAT PARIS AS THOUGH IT STILL EXISTED
IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT WHEN THE AUTHOR CONDUCTS HIS READERS TO A SPOT AND SAYS
IN SUCH A STREET THERE STANDS SUCH AND SUCH A HOUSE NEITHER STREET
NOR HOUSE WILL ANY LONGER EXIST IN THAT LOCALITY
READERS MAY VERIFY
THE FACTS IF THEY CARE TO TAKE THE TROUBLE
FOR HIS OWN PART HE IS
UNACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW PARIS AND HE WRITES WITH THE OLD PARIS BEFORE
HIS EYES IN AN ILLUSION WHICH IS PRECIOUS TO HIM
IT IS A DELIGHT TO HIM
TO DREAM THAT THERE STILL LINGERS BEHIND HIM SOMETHING OF THAT WHICH HE
BEHELD WHEN HE WAS IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AND THAT ALL HAS NOT VANISHED
SO LONG AS YOU GO AND COME IN YOUR NATIVE LAND YOU IMAGINE THAT THOSE
STREETS ARE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO YOU THAT THOSE WINDOWS
THOSE ROOFS AND THOSE DOORS ARE NOTHING TO YOU THAT THOSE WALLS ARE
STRANGERS TO YOU THAT THOSE TREES ARE MERELY THE FIRST ENCOUNTERED
HAPHAZARD THAT THOSE HOUSES WHICH YOU DO NOT ENTER ARE USELESS TO
YOU THAT THE PAVEMENTS WHICH YOU TREAD ARE MERELY STONES
LATER ON
WHEN YOU ARE NO LONGER THERE YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE STREETS ARE DEAR TO
YOU THAT YOU MISS THOSE ROOFS THOSE DOORS AND THAT THOSE WALLS ARE
NECESSARY TO YOU THOSE TREES ARE WELL BELOVED BY YOU THAT YOU ENTERED
THOSE HOUSES WHICH YOU NEVER ENTERED EVERY DAY AND THAT YOU HAVE LEFT
A PART OF YOUR HEART OF YOUR BLOOD OF YOUR SOUL IN THOSE PAVEMENTS
ALL THOSE PLACES WHICH YOU NO LONGER BEHOLD WHICH YOU MAY NEVER
BEHOLD AGAIN PERCHANCE AND WHOSE MEMORY YOU HAVE CHERISHED TAKE ON
A MELANCHOLY CHARM RECUR TO YOUR MIND WITH THE MELANCHOLY OF AN
APPARITION MAKE THE HOLY LAND VISIBLE TO YOU AND ARE SO TO SPEAK
THE VERY FORM OF FRANCE AND YOU LOVE THEM AND YOU CALL THEM UP AS THEY
ARE AS THEY WERE AND YOU PERSIST IN THIS AND YOU WILL SUBMIT TO NO
CHANGE FOR YOU ARE ATTACHED TO THE FIGURE OF YOUR FATHERLAND AS TO THE
FACE OF YOUR MOTHER
MAY WE THEN BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK OF THE PAST IN THE PRESENT THAT
SAID WE BEG THE READER TO TAKE NOTE OF IT AND WE CONTINUE
JEAN VALJEAN INSTANTLY QUITTED THE BOULEVARD AND PLUNGED INTO THE
STREETS TAKING THE MOST INTRICATE LINES WHICH HE COULD DEVISE
RETURNING ON HIS TRACK AT TIMES TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WAS NOT BEING
FOLLOWED
ILLUSTRATION THE BLACK HUNT 2B5 1 BLACK HUNT
THIS MANOEUVRE IS PECULIAR TO THE HUNTED STAG
ON SOIL WHERE AN
IMPRINT OF THE TRACK MAY BE LEFT THIS MANOEUVRE POSSESSES AMONG OTHER
ADVANTAGES THAT OF DECEIVING THE HUNTSMEN AND THE DOGS BY THROWING
THEM ON THE WRONG SCENT
IN VENERY THIS IS CALLED FALSE RE IMBUSHMENT
THE MOON WAS FULL THAT NIGHT
JEAN VALJEAN WAS NOT SORRY FOR THIS
THE
MOON STILL VERY CLOSE TO THE HORIZON CAST GREAT MASSES OF LIGHT AND
SHADOW IN THE STREETS
JEAN VALJEAN COULD GLIDE ALONG CLOSE TO THE
HOUSES ON THE DARK SIDE AND YET KEEP WATCH ON THE LIGHT SIDE
HE DID
NOT PERHAPS TAKE SUFFICIENTLY INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THE
DARK SIDE ESCAPED HIM
STILL IN THE DESERTED LANES WHICH LIE NEAR THE
RUE POLIVEAU HE THOUGHT HE FELT CERTAIN THAT NO ONE WAS FOLLOWING HIM
COSETTE WALKED ON WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTIONS
THE SUFFERINGS OF THE
FIRST SIX YEARS OF HER LIFE HAD INSTILLED SOMETHING PASSIVE INTO HER
NATURE
MOREOVER AND THIS IS A REMARK TO WHICH WE SHALL FREQUENTLY
HAVE OCCASION TO RECUR SHE HAD GROWN USED WITHOUT BEING HERSELF
AWARE OF IT TO THE PECULIARITIES OF THIS GOOD MAN AND TO THE FREAKS OF
DESTINY
AND THEN SHE WAS WITH HIM AND SHE FELT SAFE
JEAN VALJEAN KNEW NO MORE WHERE HE WAS GOING THAN DID COSETTE
HE
TRUSTED IN GOD AS SHE TRUSTED IN HIM
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE ALSO WERE
CLINGING TO THE HAND OF SOME ONE GREATER THAN HIMSELF HE THOUGHT HE
FELT A BEING LEADING HIM THOUGH INVISIBLE
HOWEVER HE HAD NO SETTLED
IDEA NO PLAN NO PROJECT
HE WAS NOT EVEN ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT IT WAS
JAVERT AND THEN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN JAVERT WITHOUT JAVERT KNOWING THAT
HE WAS JEAN VALJEAN
WAS NOT HE DISGUISED WAS NOT HE BELIEVED TO BE
DEAD STILL QUEER THINGS HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL DAYS
HE WANTED
NO MORE OF THEM
HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO RETURN TO THE GORBEAU HOUSE
LIKE THE WILD ANIMAL CHASED FROM ITS LAIR HE WAS SEEKING A HOLE IN
WHICH HE MIGHT HIDE UNTIL HE COULD FIND ONE WHERE HE MIGHT DWELL
JEAN VALJEAN DESCRIBED MANY AND VARIED LABYRINTHS IN THE MOUFFETARD
QUARTER WHICH WAS ALREADY ASLEEP AS THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE
MIDDLE AGES AND THE YOKE OF THE CURFEW STILL EXISTED HE COMBINED IN
VARIOUS MANNERS WITH CUNNING STRATEGY THE RUE CENSIER AND THE RUE
COPEAU THE RUE DU BATTOIR SAINT VICTOR AND THE RUE DU PUITS L'ERMITE
THERE ARE LODGING HOUSES IN THIS LOCALITY BUT HE DID NOT EVEN ENTER
ONE FINDING NOTHING WHICH SUITED HIM
HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT IF ANY ONE
HAD CHANCED TO BE UPON HIS TRACK THEY WOULD HAVE LOST IT
AS ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK FROM SAINT ETIENNE DU MONT HE WAS TRAVERSING
THE RUE DE PONTOISE IN FRONT OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMMISSARY OF POLICE
SITUATED AT NO
14
A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE INSTINCT OF WHICH WE HAVE
SPOKEN ABOVE MADE HIM TURN ROUND
AT THAT MOMENT HE SAW DISTINCTLY
THANKS TO THE COMMISSARY'S LANTERN WHICH BETRAYED THEM THREE MEN
WHO WERE FOLLOWING HIM CLOSELY PASS ONE AFTER THE OTHER UNDER THAT
LANTERN ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE STREET
ONE OF THE THREE ENTERED THE
ALLEY LEADING TO THE COMMISSARY'S HOUSE
THE ONE WHO MARCHED AT THEIR
HEAD STRUCK HIM AS DECIDEDLY SUSPICIOUS
COME CHILD HE SAID TO COSETTE AND HE MADE HASTE TO QUIT THE RUE
PONTOISE
HE TOOK A CIRCUIT TURNED INTO THE PASSAGE DES PATRIARCHES WHICH WAS
CLOSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE HOUR STRODE ALONG THE RUE DE L'EPEE DE BOIS
AND THE RUE DE L'ARBALETE AND PLUNGED INTO THE RUE DES POSTES
AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A SQUARE FORMED BY THE INTERSECTION OF
STREETS WHERE THE COLLEGE ROLLIN STANDS TO DAY AND WHERE THE RUE
NEUVE SAINTE GENEVIEVE TURNS OFF
IT IS UNDERSTOOD OF COURSE THAT THE RUE NEUVE SAINTE GENEVIEVE IS AN
OLD STREET AND THAT A POSTING CHAISE DOES NOT PASS THROUGH THE RUE DES
POSTES ONCE IN TEN YEARS
IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THIS RUE DES POSTES
WAS INHABITED BY POTTERS AND ITS REAL NAME IS RUE DES POTS
THE MOON CAST A LIVID LIGHT INTO THIS OPEN SPACE
JEAN VALJEAN WENT INTO
AMBUSH IN A DOORWAY CALCULATING THAT IF THE MEN WERE STILL FOLLOWING
HIM HE COULD NOT FAIL TO GET A GOOD LOOK AT THEM AS THEY TRAVERSED
THIS ILLUMINATED SPACE
IN POINT OF FACT THREE MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED WHEN THE MEN MADE THEIR
APPEARANCE
THERE WERE FOUR OF THEM NOW
ALL WERE TALL DRESSED IN LONG
BROWN COATS WITH ROUND HATS AND HUGE CUDGELS IN THEIR HANDS
THEIR
GREAT STATURE AND THEIR VAST FISTS RENDERED THEM NO LESS ALARMING
THAN DID THEIR SINISTER STRIDE THROUGH THE DARKNESS
ONE WOULD HAVE
PRONOUNCED THEM FOUR SPECTRES DISGUISED AS BOURGEOIS
THEY HALTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPACE AND FORMED A GROUP LIKE MEN IN
CONSULTATION
THEY HAD AN AIR OF INDECISION
THE ONE WHO APPEARED TO BE
THEIR LEADER TURNED ROUND AND POINTED HASTILY WITH HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE
DIRECTION WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAD TAKEN ANOTHER SEEMED TO INDICATE THE
CONTRARY DIRECTION WITH CONSIDERABLE OBSTINACY
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE
FIRST MAN WHEELED ROUND THE MOON FELL FULL IN HIS FACE
JEAN VALJEAN
RECOGNIZED JAVERT PERFECTLY
CHAPTER II IT IS LUCKY THAT THE PONT D'AUSTERLITZ BEARS CARRIAGES
UNCERTAINTY WAS AT AN END FOR JEAN VALJEAN FORTUNATELY IT STILL LASTED
FOR THE MEN
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEIR HESITATION
IT WAS TIME LOST FOR
THEM BUT GAINED FOR HIM
HE SLIPPED FROM UNDER THE GATE WHERE HE HAD
CONCEALED HIMSELF AND WENT DOWN THE RUE DES POSTES TOWARDS THE REGION
OF THE JARDIN DES PLANTES
COSETTE WAS BEGINNING TO BE TIRED
HE TOOK
HER IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER
THERE WERE NO PASSERS BY AND THE
STREET LANTERNS HAD NOT BEEN LIGHTED ON ACCOUNT OF THERE BEING A MOON
HE REDOUBLED HIS PACE
IN A FEW STRIDES HE HAD REACHED THE GOBLET POTTERIES ON THE FRONT
OF WHICH THE MOONLIGHT RENDERED DISTINCTLY LEGIBLE THE ANCIENT
INSCRIPTION
DE GOBLET FILS C'EST ICI LA FABRIQUE 14
VENEZ CHOISIR DES CRUCHES ET DES BROOS
DES POTS A FLEURS DES TUYAUX DE LA BRIQUE
A TOUT VENANT LE COEUR VEND DES CARREAUX
HE LEFT BEHIND HIM THE RUE DE LA CLEF THEN THE FOUNTAIN SAINT VICTOR
SKIRTED THE JARDIN DES PLANTES BY THE LOWER STREETS AND REACHED THE
QUAY
THERE HE TURNED ROUND
THE QUAY WAS DESERTED
THE STREETS WERE
DESERTED
THERE WAS NO ONE BEHIND HIM
HE DREW A LONG BREATH
HE GAINED THE PONT D'AUSTERLITZ
TOLLS WERE STILL COLLECTED THERE AT THAT EPOCH
HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE TOLL OFFICE AND HANDED OVER A SOU
IT IS TWO SOUS SAID THE OLD SOLDIER IN CHARGE OF THE BRIDGE
YOU ARE
CARRYING A CHILD WHO CAN WALK
PAY FOR TWO
HE PAID VEXED THAT HIS PASSAGE SHOULD HAVE AROUSED REMARK
EVERY FLIGHT
SHOULD BE AN IMPERCEPTIBLE SLIPPING AWAY
A HEAVY CART WAS CROSSING THE SEINE AT THE SAME TIME AS HIMSELF AND ON
ITS WAY LIKE HIM TO THE RIGHT BANK
THIS WAS OF USE TO HIM
HE COULD
TRAVERSE THE BRIDGE IN THE SHADOW OF THE CART
TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE COSETTE WHOSE FEET WERE BENUMBED
WANTED TO WALK
HE SET HER ON THE GROUND AND TOOK HER HAND AGAIN
THE BRIDGE ONCE CROSSED HE PERCEIVED SOME TIMBER YARDS ON HIS RIGHT
HE
DIRECTED HIS COURSE THITHER
IN ORDER TO REACH THEM IT WAS NECESSARY TO
RISK HIMSELF IN A TOLERABLY LARGE UNSHELTERED AND ILLUMINATED SPACE
HE DID NOT HESITATE
THOSE WHO WERE ON HIS TRACK HAD EVIDENTLY LOST THE
SCENT AND JEAN VALJEAN BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE OUT OF DANGER
HUNTED
YES FOLLOWED NO
A LITTLE STREET THE RUE DU CHEMIN VERT SAINT ANTOINE OPENED OUT
BETWEEN TWO TIMBER YARDS ENCLOSED IN WALLS
THIS STREET WAS DARK AND
NARROW AND SEEMED MADE EXPRESSLY FOR HIM
BEFORE ENTERING IT HE CAST A
GLANCE BEHIND HIM
FROM THE POINT WHERE HE STOOD HE COULD SEE THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE PONT
D'AUSTERLITZ
FOUR SHADOWS WERE JUST ENTERING ON THE BRIDGE
THESE SHADOWS HAD THEIR BACKS TURNED TO THE JARDIN DES PLANTES AND WERE
ON THEIR WAY TO THE RIGHT BANK
THESE FOUR SHADOWS WERE THE FOUR MEN
JEAN VALJEAN SHUDDERED LIKE THE WILD BEAST WHICH IS RECAPTURED
ONE HOPE REMAINED TO HIM IT WAS THAT THE MEN HAD NOT PERHAPS STEPPED
ON THE BRIDGE AND HAD NOT CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM WHILE HE WAS CROSSING THE
LARGE ILLUMINATED SPACE HOLDING COSETTE BY THE HAND
IN THAT CASE BY PLUNGING INTO THE LITTLE STREET BEFORE HIM HE
MIGHT ESCAPE IF HE COULD REACH THE TIMBER YARDS THE MARSHES THE
MARKET GARDENS THE UNINHABITED GROUND WHICH WAS NOT BUILT UPON
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT COMMIT HIMSELF TO THAT SILENT LITTLE
STREET
HE ENTERED IT
CHAPTER III TO WIT THE PLAN OF PARIS IN 1727
THREE HUNDRED PACES FURTHER ON HE ARRIVED AT A POINT WHERE THE STREET
FORKED
IT SEPARATED INTO TWO STREETS WHICH RAN IN A SLANTING LINE ONE
TO THE RIGHT AND THE OTHER TO THE LEFT
JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEFORE HIM WHAT RESEMBLED THE TWO BRANCHES OF A Y
WHICH SHOULD HE CHOOSE HE DID NOT HESITATE BUT TOOK THE ONE ON THE
RIGHT
WHY
BECAUSE THAT TO THE LEFT RAN TOWARDS A SUBURB THAT IS TO SAY TOWARDS
INHABITED REGIONS AND THE RIGHT BRANCH TOWARDS THE OPEN COUNTRY THAT
IS TO SAY TOWARDS DESERTED REGIONS
HOWEVER THEY NO LONGER WALKED VERY FAST
COSETTE'S PACE RETARDED JEAN
VALJEAN'S
HE TOOK HER UP AND CARRIED HER AGAIN
COSETTE LAID HER HEAD ON THE
SHOULDER OF THE GOOD MAN AND SAID NOT A WORD
HE TURNED ROUND FROM TIME TO TIME AND LOOKED BEHIND HIM
HE TOOK CARE TO
KEEP ALWAYS ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE STREET
THE STREET WAS STRAIGHT
IN HIS REAR
THE FIRST TWO OR THREE TIMES THAT HE TURNED ROUND HE SAW
NOTHING THE SILENCE WAS PROFOUND AND HE CONTINUED HIS MARCH SOMEWHAT
REASSURED
ALL AT ONCE ON TURNING ROUND HE THOUGHT HE PERCEIVED IN THE
PORTION OF THE STREET WHICH HE HAD JUST PASSED THROUGH FAR OFF IN THE
OBSCURITY SOMETHING WHICH WAS MOVING
HE RUSHED FORWARD PRECIPITATELY RATHER THAN WALKED HOPING TO FIND SOME
SIDE STREET TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE THROUGH IT AND THUS TO BREAK HIS SCENT
ONCE MORE
HE ARRIVED AT A WALL
THIS WALL HOWEVER DID NOT ABSOLUTELY PREVENT FURTHER PROGRESS IT WAS
A WALL WHICH BORDERED A TRANSVERSE STREET IN WHICH THE ONE HE HAD TAKEN
ENDED
HERE AGAIN HE WAS OBLIGED TO COME TO A DECISION SHOULD HE GO TO THE
RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT
HE GLANCED TO THE RIGHT
THE FRAGMENTARY LANE WAS PROLONGED BETWEEN
BUILDINGS WHICH WERE EITHER SHEDS OR BARNS THEN ENDED AT A BLIND ALLEY
THE EXTREMITY OF THE CUL DE SAC WAS DISTINCTLY VISIBLE A LOFTY WHITE
WALL
HE GLANCED TO THE LEFT
ON THAT SIDE THE LANE WAS OPEN AND ABOUT
TWO HUNDRED PACES FURTHER ON RAN INTO A STREET OF WHICH IT WAS THE
AFFLUENT
ON THAT SIDE LAY SAFETY
AT THE MOMENT WHEN JEAN VALJEAN WAS MEDITATING A TURN TO THE LEFT IN
AN EFFORT TO REACH THE STREET WHICH HE SAW AT THE END OF THE LANE HE
PERCEIVED A SORT OF MOTIONLESS BLACK STATUE AT THE CORNER OF THE LANE
AND THE STREET TOWARDS WHICH HE WAS ON THE POINT OF DIRECTING HIS STEPS
IT WAS SOME ONE A MAN WHO HAD EVIDENTLY JUST BEEN POSTED THERE AND
WHO WAS BARRING THE PASSAGE AND WAITING
JEAN VALJEAN RECOILED
THE POINT OF PARIS WHERE JEAN VALJEAN FOUND HIMSELF SITUATED BETWEEN
THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE AND LA RAPEE IS ONE OF THOSE WHICH RECENT
IMPROVEMENTS HAVE TRANSFORMED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM RESULTING IN
DISFIGUREMENT ACCORDING TO SOME AND IN A TRANSFIGURATION ACCORDING TO
OTHERS
THE MARKET GARDENS THE TIMBER YARDS AND THE OLD BUILDINGS
HAVE BEEN EFFACED
TO DAY THERE ARE BRAND NEW WIDE STREETS ARENAS
CIRCUSES HIPPODROMES RAILWAY STATIONS AND A PRISON MAZAS THERE
PROGRESS AS THE READER SEES WITH ITS ANTIDOTE
HALF A CENTURY AGO IN THAT ORDINARY POPULAR TONGUE WHICH IS ALL
COMPOUNDED OF TRADITIONS WHICH PERSISTS IN CALLING THE INSTITUT LES
QUATRE NATIONS AND THE OPERA COMIQUE FEYDEAU THE PRECISE SPOT
WHITHER JEAN VALJEAN HAD ARRIVED WAS CALLED LE PETIT PICPUS
THE
PORTE SAINT JACQUES THE PORTE PARIS THE BARRIERE DES SERGENTS THE
PORCHERONS LA GALIOTE LES CELESTINS LES CAPUCINS LE MAIL LA BOURBE
L'ARBRE DE CRACOVIE LA PETITE POLOGNE THESE ARE THE NAMES OF OLD PARIS
WHICH SURVIVE AMID THE NEW
THE MEMORY OF THE POPULACE HOVERS OVER THESE
RELICS OF THE PAST
LE PETIT PICPUS WHICH MOREOVER HARDLY EVER HAD ANY EXISTENCE AND
NEVER WAS MORE THAN THE OUTLINE OF A QUARTER HAD NEARLY THE MONKISH
ASPECT OF A SPANISH TOWN
THE ROADS WERE NOT MUCH PAVED THE STREETS
WERE NOT MUCH BUILT UP
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TWO OR THREE STREETS
OF WHICH WE SHALL PRESENTLY SPEAK ALL WAS WALL AND SOLITUDE THERE
NOT
A SHOP NOT A VEHICLE HARDLY A CANDLE LIGHTED HERE AND THERE IN THE
WINDOWS ALL LIGHTS EXTINGUISHED AFTER TEN O'CLOCK
GARDENS CONVENTS
TIMBER YARDS MARSHES OCCASIONAL LOWLY DWELLINGS AND GREAT WALLS AS
HIGH AS THE HOUSES
SUCH WAS THIS QUARTER IN THE LAST CENTURY
THE REVOLUTION SNUBBED
IT SOUNDLY
THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT DEMOLISHED AND CUT THROUGH IT
RUBBISH SHOOTS WERE ESTABLISHED THERE
THIRTY YEARS AGO THIS QUARTER
WAS DISAPPEARING UNDER THE ERASING PROCESS OF NEW BUILDINGS
TO DAY
IT HAS BEEN UTTERLY BLOTTED OUT
THE PETIT PICPUS OF WHICH NO EXISTING
PLAN HAS PRESERVED A TRACE IS INDICATED WITH SUFFICIENT CLEARNESS
IN THE PLAN OF 1727 PUBLISHED AT PARIS BY DENIS THIERRY RUE
SAINT JACQUES OPPOSITE THE RUE DU PLATRE AND AT LYONS BY JEAN GIRIN
RUE MERCIERE AT THE SIGN OF PRUDENCE
PETIT PICPUS HAD AS
WE HAVE JUST MENTIONED A Y OF STREETS FORMED BY THE RUE DU
CHEMIN VERT SAINT ANTOINE WHICH SPREAD OUT IN TWO BRANCHES TAKING ON
THE LEFT THE NAME OF LITTLE PICPUS STREET AND ON THE RIGHT THE NAME OF
THE RUE POLONCEAU
THE TWO LIMBS OF THE Y WERE CONNECTED AT THE APEX
AS BY A BAR THIS BAR WAS CALLED RUE DROIT MUR
THE RUE POLONCEAU ENDED
THERE RUE PETIT PICPUS PASSED ON AND ASCENDED TOWARDS THE LENOIR
MARKET
A PERSON COMING FROM THE SEINE REACHED THE EXTREMITY OF THE RUE
POLONCEAU AND HAD ON HIS RIGHT THE RUE DROIT MUR TURNING ABRUPTLY AT A
RIGHT ANGLE IN FRONT OF HIM THE WALL OF THAT STREET AND ON HIS RIGHT A
TRUNCATED PROLONGATION OF THE RUE DROIT MUR WHICH HAD NO ISSUE AND WAS
CALLED THE CUL DE SAC GENROT
IT WAS HERE THAT JEAN VALJEAN STOOD
AS WE HAVE JUST SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF THAT BLACK SILHOUETTE
STANDING ON GUARD AT THE ANGLE OF THE RUE DROIT MUR AND THE RUE
PETIT PICPUS HE RECOILED
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF IT
THAT PHANTOM
WAS LYING IN WAIT FOR HIM
WHAT WAS HE TO DO
THE TIME FOR RETREATING WAS PASSED
THAT WHICH HE HAD PERCEIVED IN
MOVEMENT AN INSTANT BEFORE IN THE DISTANT DARKNESS WAS JAVERT AND HIS
SQUAD WITHOUT A DOUBT
JAVERT WAS PROBABLY ALREADY AT THE COMMENCEMENT
OF THE STREET AT WHOSE END JEAN VALJEAN STOOD
JAVERT TO ALL
APPEARANCES WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THIS LITTLE LABYRINTH AND HAD TAKEN
HIS PRECAUTIONS BY SENDING ONE OF HIS MEN TO GUARD THE EXIT
THESE
SURMISES WHICH SO CLOSELY RESEMBLED PROOFS WHIRLED SUDDENLY LIKE A
HANDFUL OF DUST CAUGHT UP BY AN UNEXPECTED GUST OF WIND THROUGH JEAN
VALJEAN'S MOURNFUL BRAIN
HE EXAMINED THE CUL DE SAC GENROT THERE HE
WAS CUT OFF
HE EXAMINED THE RUE PETIT PICPUS THERE STOOD A SENTINEL
HE SAW THAT BLACK FORM STANDING OUT IN RELIEF AGAINST THE WHITE
PAVEMENT ILLUMINATED BY THE MOON TO ADVANCE WAS TO FALL INTO THIS
MAN'S HANDS TO RETREAT WAS TO FLING HIMSELF INTO JAVERT'S ARMS
JEAN
VALJEAN FELT HIMSELF CAUGHT AS IN A NET WHICH WAS SLOWLY CONTRACTING
HE GAZED HEAVENWARD IN DESPAIR
CHAPTER IV THE GROPINGS OF FLIGHT
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FOLLOWS IT IS REQUISITE TO FORM AN EXACT
IDEA OF THE DROIT MUR LANE AND IN PARTICULAR OF THE ANGLE WHICH ONE
LEAVES ON THE LEFT WHEN ONE EMERGES FROM THE RUE POLONCEAU INTO THIS
LANE
DROIT MUR LANE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BORDERED ON THE RIGHT AS FAR
AS THE RUE PETIT PICPUS BY HOUSES OF MEAN ASPECT ON THE LEFT BY A
SOLITARY BUILDING OF SEVERE OUTLINES COMPOSED OF NUMEROUS PARTS WHICH
GREW GRADUALLY HIGHER BY A STORY OR TWO AS THEY APPROACHED THE RUE
PETIT PICPUS SIDE SO THAT THIS BUILDING WHICH WAS VERY LOFTY ON THE
RUE PETIT PICPUS SIDE WAS TOLERABLY LOW ON THE SIDE ADJOINING THE RUE
POLONCEAU
THERE AT THE ANGLE OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN IT DESCENDED TO
SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT CONSISTED OF MERELY A WALL
THIS WALL DID NOT ABUT
DIRECTLY ON THE STREET IT FORMED A DEEPLY RETREATING NICHE CONCEALED
BY ITS TWO CORNERS FROM TWO OBSERVERS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE IN THE
RUE POLONCEAU THE OTHER IN THE RUE DROIT MUR
BEGINNING WITH THESE ANGLES OF THE NICHE THE WALL EXTENDED ALONG THE
RUE POLONCEAU AS FAR AS A HOUSE WHICH BORE THE NUMBER 49 AND ALONG THE
RUE DROIT MUR WHERE THE FRAGMENT WAS MUCH SHORTER AS FAR AS THE GLOOMY
BUILDING WHICH WE HAVE MENTIONED AND WHOSE GABLE IT INTERSECTED THUS
FORMING ANOTHER RETREATING ANGLE IN THE STREET
THIS GABLE WAS SOMBRE
OF ASPECT ONLY ONE WINDOW WAS VISIBLE OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY TWO
SHUTTERS COVERED WITH A SHEET OF ZINC AND KEPT CONSTANTLY CLOSED
THE STATE OF THE PLACES OF WHICH WE ARE HERE GIVING A DESCRIPTION IS
RIGOROUSLY EXACT AND WILL CERTAINLY AWAKEN A VERY PRECISE MEMORY IN THE
MIND OF OLD INHABITANTS OF THE QUARTER
THE NICHE WAS ENTIRELY FILLED BY A THING WHICH RESEMBLED A COLOSSAL
AND WRETCHED DOOR IT WAS A VAST FORMLESS ASSEMBLAGE OF PERPENDICULAR
PLANKS THE UPPER ONES BEING BROADER THAN THE LOWER BOUND TOGETHER BY
LONG TRANSVERSE STRIPS OF IRON
AT ONE SIDE THERE WAS A CARRIAGE GATE OF
THE ORDINARY DIMENSIONS AND WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY NOT BEEN CUT MORE THAN
FIFTY YEARS PREVIOUSLY
A LINDEN TREE SHOWED ITS CREST ABOVE THE NICHE AND THE WALL WAS COVERED
WITH IVY ON THE SIDE OF THE RUE POLONCEAU
IN THE IMMINENT PERIL IN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN FOUND HIMSELF THIS SOMBRE
BUILDING HAD ABOUT IT A SOLITARY AND UNINHABITED LOOK WHICH TEMPTED HIM
HE RAN HIS EYES RAPIDLY OVER IT HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IF HE COULD
CONTRIVE TO GET INSIDE IT HE MIGHT SAVE HIMSELF
FIRST HE CONCEIVED AN
IDEA THEN A HOPE
IN THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE FRONT OF THIS BUILDING ON THE RUE
DROIT MUR SIDE THERE WERE AT ALL THE WINDOWS OF THE DIFFERENT STORIES
ANCIENT CISTERN PIPES OF LEAD
THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF THE PIPES WHICH
LED FROM ONE CENTRAL PIPE TO ALL THESE LITTLE BASINS SKETCHED OUT A SORT
OF TREE ON THE FRONT
THESE RAMIFICATIONS OF PIPES WITH THEIR HUNDRED
ELBOWS IMITATED THOSE OLD LEAFLESS VINE STOCKS WHICH WRITHE OVER THE
FRONTS OF OLD FARM HOUSES
THIS ODD ESPALIER WITH ITS BRANCHES OF LEAD AND IRON WAS THE FIRST
THING THAT STRUCK JEAN VALJEAN
HE SEATED COSETTE WITH HER BACK AGAINST
A STONE POST WITH AN INJUNCTION TO BE SILENT AND RAN TO THE SPOT WHERE
THE CONDUIT TOUCHED THE PAVEMENT
PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME WAY OF CLIMBING
UP BY IT AND ENTERING THE HOUSE
BUT THE PIPE WAS DILAPIDATED AND PAST
SERVICE AND HARDLY HUNG TO ITS FASTENINGS
MOREOVER ALL THE WINDOWS
OF THIS SILENT DWELLING WERE GRATED WITH HEAVY IRON BARS EVEN THE ATTIC
WINDOWS IN THE ROOF
AND THEN THE MOON FELL FULL UPON THAT FACADE AND
THE MAN WHO WAS WATCHING AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET WOULD HAVE SEEN
JEAN VALJEAN IN THE ACT OF CLIMBING
AND FINALLY WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
WITH COSETTE HOW WAS SHE TO BE DRAWN UP TO THE TOP OF A THREE STORY
HOUSE
HE GAVE UP ALL IDEA OF CLIMBING BY MEANS OF THE DRAIN PIPE AND CRAWLED
ALONG THE WALL TO GET BACK INTO THE RUE POLONCEAU
WHEN HE REACHED THE SLANT OF THE WALL WHERE HE HAD LEFT COSETTE HE
NOTICED THAT NO ONE COULD SEE HIM THERE
AS WE HAVE JUST EXPLAINED HE
WAS CONCEALED FROM ALL EYES NO MATTER FROM WHICH DIRECTION THEY WERE
APPROACHING BESIDES THIS HE WAS IN THE SHADOW
FINALLY THERE WERE
TWO DOORS PERHAPS THEY MIGHT BE FORCED
THE WALL ABOVE WHICH HE SAW THE
LINDEN TREE AND THE IVY EVIDENTLY ABUTTED ON A GARDEN WHERE HE COULD AT
LEAST HIDE HIMSELF ALTHOUGH THERE WERE AS YET NO LEAVES ON THE TREES
AND SPEND THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT
TIME WAS PASSING HE MUST ACT QUICKLY
HE FELT OVER THE CARRIAGE DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT
IT WAS IMPRACTICABLE OUTSIDE AND IN
HE APPROACHED THE OTHER DOOR WITH MORE HOPE IT WAS FRIGHTFULLY
DECREPIT ITS VERY IMMENSITY RENDERED IT LESS SOLID THE PLANKS WERE
ROTTEN THE IRON BANDS THERE WERE ONLY THREE OF THEM WERE RUSTED
IT
SEEMED AS THOUGH IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO PIERCE THIS WORM EATEN BARRIER
ON EXAMINING IT HE FOUND THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT A DOOR IT HAD NEITHER
HINGES CROSS BARS LOCK NOR FISSURE IN THE MIDDLE THE IRON BANDS
TRAVERSED IT FROM SIDE TO SIDE WITHOUT ANY BREAK
THROUGH THE CREVICES
IN THE PLANKS HE CAUGHT A VIEW OF UNHEWN SLABS AND BLOCKS OF STONE
ROUGHLY CEMENTED TOGETHER WHICH PASSERS BY MIGHT STILL HAVE SEEN THERE
TEN YEARS AGO
HE WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE WITH CONSTERNATION THAT THIS
APPARENT DOOR WAS SIMPLY THE WOODEN DECORATION OF A BUILDING AGAINST
WHICH IT WAS PLACED
IT WAS EASY TO TEAR OFF A PLANK BUT THEN ONE
FOUND ONE'S SELF FACE TO FACE WITH A WALL
CHAPTER V WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GAS LANTERNS
AT THAT MOMENT A HEAVY AND MEASURED SOUND BEGAN TO BE AUDIBLE AT SOME
DISTANCE
JEAN VALJEAN RISKED A GLANCE ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET
SEVEN OR EIGHT SOLDIERS DRAWN UP IN A PLATOON HAD JUST DEBOUCHED
INTO THE RUE POLONCEAU
HE SAW THE GLEAM OF THEIR BAYONETS
THEY WERE
ADVANCING TOWARDS HIM THESE SOLDIERS AT WHOSE HEAD HE DISTINGUISHED
JAVERT'S TALL FIGURE ADVANCED SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY
THEY HALTED
FREQUENTLY IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY WERE SEARCHING ALL THE NOOKS OF THE
WALLS AND ALL THE EMBRASURES OF THE DOORS AND ALLEYS
THIS WAS SOME PATROL THAT JAVERT HAD ENCOUNTERED THERE COULD BE NO
MISTAKE AS TO THIS SURMISE AND WHOSE AID HE HAD DEMANDED
JAVERT'S TWO ACOLYTES WERE MARCHING IN THEIR RANKS
AT THE RATE AT WHICH THEY WERE MARCHING AND IN CONSIDERATION OF THE
HALTS WHICH THEY WERE MAKING IT WOULD TAKE THEM ABOUT A QUARTER OF
AN HOUR TO REACH THE SPOT WHERE JEAN VALJEAN STOOD
IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL
MOMENT
A FEW MINUTES ONLY SEPARATED JEAN VALJEAN FROM THAT TERRIBLE
PRECIPICE WHICH YAWNED BEFORE HIM FOR THE THIRD TIME
AND THE GALLEYS
NOW MEANT NOT ONLY THE GALLEYS BUT COSETTE LOST TO HIM FOREVER THAT IS
TO SAY A LIFE RESEMBLING THE INTERIOR OF A TOMB
THERE WAS BUT ONE THING WHICH WAS POSSIBLE
JEAN VALJEAN HAD THIS PECULIARITY THAT HE CARRIED AS ONE MIGHT SAY
TWO BEGGAR'S POUCHES IN ONE HE KEPT HIS SAINTLY THOUGHTS IN THE OTHER
THE REDOUBTABLE TALENTS OF A CONVICT
HE RUMMAGED IN THE ONE OR THE
OTHER ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES
AMONG HIS OTHER RESOURCES THANKS TO HIS NUMEROUS ESCAPES FROM THE
PRISON AT TOULON HE WAS AS IT WILL BE REMEMBERED A PAST MASTER IN THE
INCREDIBLE ART OF CRAWLING UP WITHOUT LADDER OR CLIMBING IRONS BY SHEER
MUSCULAR FORCE BY LEANING ON THE NAPE OF HIS NECK HIS SHOULDERS HIS
HIPS AND HIS KNEES BY HELPING HIMSELF ON THE RARE PROJECTIONS OF THE
STONE IN THE RIGHT ANGLE OF A WALL AS HIGH AS THE SIXTH STORY IF NEED
BE AN ART WHICH HAS RENDERED SO CELEBRATED AND SO ALARMING THAT CORNER
OF THE WALL OF THE CONCIERGERIE OF PARIS BY WHICH BATTEMOLLE CONDEMNED
TO DEATH MADE HIS ESCAPE TWENTY YEARS AGO
JEAN VALJEAN MEASURED WITH HIS EYES THE WALL ABOVE WHICH HE ESPIED THE
LINDEN IT WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT
THE ANGLE WHICH IT FORMED
WITH THE GABLE OF THE LARGE BUILDING WAS FILLED AT ITS LOWER EXTREMITY
BY A MASS OF MASONRY OF A TRIANGULAR SHAPE PROBABLY INTENDED TO
PRESERVE THAT TOO CONVENIENT CORNER FROM THE RUBBISH OF THOSE DIRTY
CREATURES CALLED THE PASSERS BY
THIS PRACTICE OF FILLING UP CORNERS OF
THE WALL IS MUCH IN USE IN PARIS
THIS MASS WAS ABOUT FIVE FEET IN HEIGHT THE SPACE ABOVE THE SUMMIT OF
THIS MASS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO CLIMB WAS NOT MORE THAN FOURTEEN
FEET
THE WALL WAS SURMOUNTED BY A FLAT STONE WITHOUT A COPING
COSETTE WAS THE DIFFICULTY FOR SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO CLIMB A WALL
SHOULD HE ABANDON HER JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT ONCE THINK OF THAT
IT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY HER
A MAN'S WHOLE STRENGTH IS REQUIRED TO
SUCCESSFULLY CARRY OUT THESE SINGULAR ASCENTS
THE LEAST BURDEN WOULD
DISTURB HIS CENTRE OF GRAVITY AND PULL HIM DOWNWARDS
A ROPE WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED JEAN VALJEAN HAD NONE
WHERE WAS HE TO
GET A ROPE AT MIDNIGHT IN THE RUE POLONCEAU CERTAINLY IF JEAN VALJEAN
HAD HAD A KINGDOM HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT FOR A ROPE AT THAT MOMENT
ALL EXTREME SITUATIONS HAVE THEIR LIGHTNING FLASHES WHICH SOMETIMES
DAZZLE SOMETIMES ILLUMINATE US
JEAN VALJEAN'S DESPAIRING GLANCE FELL ON THE STREET LANTERN POST OF THE
BLIND ALLEY GENROT
AT THAT EPOCH THERE WERE NO GAS JETS IN THE STREETS OF PARIS
AT
NIGHTFALL LANTERNS PLACED AT REGULAR DISTANCES WERE LIGHTED THEY WERE
ASCENDED AND DESCENDED BY MEANS OF A ROPE WHICH TRAVERSED THE STREET
FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND WAS ADJUSTED IN A GROOVE OF THE POST
THE PULLEY
OVER WHICH THIS ROPE RAN WAS FASTENED UNDERNEATH THE LANTERN IN A LITTLE
IRON BOX THE KEY TO WHICH WAS KEPT BY THE LAMP LIGHTER AND THE ROPE
ITSELF WAS PROTECTED BY A METAL CASE
JEAN VALJEAN WITH THE ENERGY OF A SUPREME STRUGGLE CROSSED THE STREET
AT ONE BOUND ENTERED THE BLIND ALLEY BROKE THE LATCH OF THE LITTLE BOX
WITH THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE AND AN INSTANT LATER HE WAS BESIDE COSETTE
ONCE MORE
HE HAD A ROPE
THESE GLOOMY INVENTORS OF EXPEDIENTS WORK
RAPIDLY WHEN THEY ARE FIGHTING AGAINST FATALITY
WE HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED THAT THE LANTERNS HAD NOT BEEN LIGHTED THAT
NIGHT
THE LANTERN IN THE CUL DE SAC GENROT WAS THUS NATURALLY EXTINCT
LIKE THE REST AND ONE COULD PASS DIRECTLY UNDER IT WITHOUT EVEN
NOTICING THAT IT WAS NO LONGER IN ITS PLACE
NEVERTHELESS THE HOUR THE PLACE THE DARKNESS JEAN VALJEAN'S
ABSORPTION HIS SINGULAR GESTURES HIS GOINGS AND COMINGS ALL HAD BEGUN
TO RENDER COSETTE UNEASY
ANY OTHER CHILD THAN SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN VENT
TO LOUD SHRIEKS LONG BEFORE
SHE CONTENTED HERSELF WITH PLUCKING JEAN
VALJEAN BY THE SKIRT OF HIS COAT
THEY COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF THE
PATROL'S APPROACH EVER MORE AND MORE DISTINCTLY
FATHER SAID SHE IN A VERY LOW VOICE I AM AFRAID
WHO IS COMING
YONDER
HUSH REPLIED THE UNHAPPY MAN IT IS MADAME THENARDIER
COSETTE SHUDDERED
HE ADDED
SAY NOTHING
DON'T INTERFERE WITH ME
IF YOU CRY OUT IF YOU WEEP THE
THENARDIER IS LYING IN WAIT FOR YOU
SHE IS COMING TO TAKE YOU BACK
THEN WITHOUT HASTE BUT WITHOUT MAKING A USELESS MOVEMENT WITH FIRM
AND CURT PRECISION THE MORE REMARKABLE AT A MOMENT WHEN THE PATROL AND
JAVERT MIGHT COME UPON HIM AT ANY MOMENT HE UNDID HIS CRAVAT PASSED IT
ROUND COSETTE'S BODY UNDER THE ARMPITS TAKING CARE THAT IT SHOULD NOT
HURT THE CHILD FASTENED THIS CRAVAT TO ONE END OF THE ROPE BY MEANS OF
THAT KNOT WHICH SEAFARING MEN CALL A SWALLOW KNOT TOOK THE OTHER END
OF THE ROPE IN HIS TEETH PULLED OFF HIS SHOES AND STOCKINGS WHICH
HE THREW OVER THE WALL STEPPED UPON THE MASS OF MASONRY AND BEGAN
TO RAISE HIMSELF IN THE ANGLE OF THE WALL AND THE GABLE WITH AS MUCH
SOLIDITY AND CERTAINTY AS THOUGH HE HAD THE ROUNDS OF A LADDER UNDER HIS
FEET AND ELBOWS
HALF A MINUTE HAD NOT ELAPSED WHEN HE WAS RESTING ON
HIS KNEES ON THE WALL
COSETTE GAZED AT HIM IN STUPID AMAZEMENT WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD
JEAN
VALJEAN'S INJUNCTION AND THE NAME OF MADAME THENARDIER HAD CHILLED HER
BLOOD
ALL AT ONCE SHE HEARD JEAN VALJEAN'S VOICE CRYING TO HER THOUGH IN A
VERY LOW TONE
PUT YOUR BACK AGAINST THE WALL
SHE OBEYED
DON'T SAY A WORD AND DON'T BE ALARMED WENT ON JEAN VALJEAN
AND SHE FELT HERSELF LIFTED FROM THE GROUND
BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO RECOVER HERSELF SHE WAS ON THE TOP OF THE WALL
JEAN VALJEAN GRASPED HER PUT HER ON HIS BACK TOOK HER TWO TINY HANDS
IN HIS LARGE LEFT HAND LAY DOWN FLAT ON HIS STOMACH AND CRAWLED ALONG
ON TOP OF THE WALL AS FAR AS THE CANT
AS HE HAD GUESSED THERE STOOD
A BUILDING WHOSE ROOF STARTED FROM THE TOP OF THE WOODEN BARRICADE AND
DESCENDED TO WITHIN A VERY SHORT DISTANCE OF THE GROUND WITH A GENTLE
SLOPE WHICH GRAZED THE LINDEN TREE
A LUCKY CIRCUMSTANCE FOR THE WALL
WAS MUCH HIGHER ON THIS SIDE THAN ON THE STREET SIDE
JEAN VALJEAN COULD
ONLY SEE THE GROUND AT A GREAT DEPTH BELOW HIM
HE HAD JUST REACHED THE SLOPE OF THE ROOF AND HAD NOT YET LEFT THE
CREST OF THE WALL WHEN A VIOLENT UPROAR ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF THE
PATROL
THE THUNDERING VOICE OF JAVERT WAS AUDIBLE
SEARCH THE BLIND ALLEY THE RUE DROIT MUR IS GUARDED SO IS THE RUE
PETIT PICPUS
I'LL ANSWER FOR IT THAT HE IS IN THE BLIND ALLEY
THE SOLDIERS RUSHED INTO THE GENROT ALLEY
JEAN VALJEAN ALLOWED HIMSELF TO SLIDE DOWN THE ROOF STILL HOLDING FAST
TO COSETTE REACHED THE LINDEN TREE AND LEAPED TO THE GROUND
WHETHER
FROM TERROR OR COURAGE COSETTE HAD NOT BREATHED A SOUND THOUGH HER
HANDS WERE A LITTLE ABRADED
CHAPTER VI THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMA
JEAN VALJEAN FOUND HIMSELF IN A SORT OF GARDEN WHICH WAS VERY VAST AND
OF SINGULAR ASPECT ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY GARDENS WHICH SEEM MADE TO
BE LOOKED AT IN WINTER AND AT NIGHT
THIS GARDEN WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE
WITH AN ALLEY OF LARGE POPLARS AT THE FURTHER END TOLERABLY TALL FOREST
TREES IN THE CORNERS AND AN UNSHADED SPACE IN THE CENTRE WHERE COULD
BE SEEN A VERY LARGE SOLITARY TREE THEN SEVERAL FRUIT TREES GNARLED
AND BRISTLING LIKE BUSHES BEDS OF VEGETABLES A MELON PATCH WHOSE
GLASS FRAMES SPARKLED IN THE MOONLIGHT AND AN OLD WELL
HERE AND
THERE STOOD STONE BENCHES WHICH SEEMED BLACK WITH MOSS
THE ALLEYS WERE
BORDERED WITH GLOOMY AND VERY ERECT LITTLE SHRUBS
THE GRASS HAD HALF
TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM AND A GREEN MOULD COVERED THE REST
JEAN VALJEAN HAD BESIDE HIM THE BUILDING WHOSE ROOF HAD SERVED HIM AS
A MEANS OF DESCENT A PILE OF FAGOTS AND BEHIND THE FAGOTS DIRECTLY
AGAINST THE WALL A STONE STATUE WHOSE MUTILATED FACE WAS NO LONGER
ANYTHING MORE THAN A SHAPELESS MASK WHICH LOOMED VAGUELY THROUGH THE
GLOOM
THE BUILDING WAS A SORT OF RUIN WHERE DISMANTLED CHAMBERS WERE
DISTINGUISHABLE ONE OF WHICH MUCH ENCUMBERED SEEMED TO SERVE AS A
SHED
THE LARGE BUILDING OF THE RUE DROIT MUR WHICH HAD A WING ON THE RUE
PETIT PICPUS TURNED TWO FACADES AT RIGHT ANGLES TOWARDS THIS GARDEN
THESE INTERIOR FACADES WERE EVEN MORE TRAGIC THAN THE EXTERIOR
ALL
THE WINDOWS WERE GRATED
NOT A GLEAM OF LIGHT WAS VISIBLE AT ANY ONE OF
THEM
THE UPPER STORY HAD SCUTTLES LIKE PRISONS
ONE OF THOSE FACADES
CAST ITS SHADOW ON THE OTHER WHICH FELL OVER THE GARDEN LIKE AN IMMENSE
BLACK PALL
NO OTHER HOUSE WAS VISIBLE
THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN WAS LOST IN MIST
AND DARKNESS
NEVERTHELESS WALLS COULD BE CONFUSEDLY MADE OUT WHICH
INTERSECTED AS THOUGH THERE WERE MORE CULTIVATED LAND BEYOND AND THE
LOW ROOFS OF THE RUE POLONCEAU
NOTHING MORE WILD AND SOLITARY THAN THIS GARDEN COULD BE IMAGINED
THERE
WAS NO ONE IN IT WHICH WAS QUITE NATURAL IN VIEW OF THE HOUR BUT IT
DID NOT SEEM AS THOUGH THIS SPOT WERE MADE FOR ANY ONE TO WALK IN EVEN
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
JEAN VALJEAN'S FIRST CARE HAD BEEN TO GET HOLD OF HIS SHOES AND PUT THEM
ON AGAIN THEN TO STEP UNDER THE SHED WITH COSETTE
A MAN WHO IS FLEEING
NEVER THINKS HIMSELF SUFFICIENTLY HIDDEN
THE CHILD WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE
STILL ON THE THENARDIER SHARED HIS INSTINCT FOR WITHDRAWING FROM SIGHT
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
COSETTE TREMBLED AND PRESSED CLOSE TO HIM
THEY HEARD THE TUMULTUOUS
NOISE OF THE PATROL SEARCHING THE BLIND ALLEY AND THE STREETS THE BLOWS
OF THEIR GUN STOCKS AGAINST THE STONES JAVERT'S APPEALS TO THE POLICE
SPIES WHOM HE HAD POSTED AND HIS IMPRECATIONS MINGLED WITH WORDS WHICH
COULD NOT BE DISTINGUISHED
AT THE EXPIRATION OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THAT
SPECIES OF STORMY ROAR WERE BECOMING MORE DISTANT
JEAN VALJEAN HELD HIS
BREATH
HE HAD LAID HIS HAND LIGHTLY ON COSETTE'S MOUTH
HOWEVER THE SOLITUDE IN WHICH HE STOOD WAS SO STRANGELY CALM THAT THIS
FRIGHTFUL UPROAR CLOSE AND FURIOUS AS IT WAS DID NOT DISTURB HIM BY SO
MUCH AS THE SHADOW OF A MISGIVING
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THOSE WALLS HAD
BEEN BUILT OF THE DEAF STONES OF WHICH THE SCRIPTURES SPEAK
ALL AT ONCE IN THE MIDST OF THIS PROFOUND CALM A FRESH SOUND AROSE A
SOUND AS CELESTIAL DIVINE INEFFABLE RAVISHING AS THE OTHER HAD BEEN
HORRIBLE
IT WAS A HYMN WHICH ISSUED FROM THE GLOOM A DAZZLING BURST
OF PRAYER AND HARMONY IN THE OBSCURE AND ALARMING SILENCE OF THE NIGHT
WOMEN'S VOICES BUT VOICES COMPOSED AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME OF THE PURE
ACCENTS OF VIRGINS AND THE INNOCENT ACCENTS OF CHILDREN VOICES WHICH
ARE NOT OF THE EARTH AND WHICH RESEMBLE THOSE THAT THE NEWBORN INFANT
STILL HEARS AND WHICH THE DYING MAN HEARS ALREADY
THIS SONG PROCEEDED
FROM THE GLOOMY EDIFICE WHICH TOWERED ABOVE THE GARDEN
AT THE MOMENT
WHEN THE HUBBUB OF DEMONS RETREATED ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT A CHOIR OF
ANGELS WAS APPROACHING THROUGH THE GLOOM
COSETTE AND JEAN VALJEAN FELL ON THEIR KNEES
THEY KNEW NOT WHAT IT WAS THEY KNEW NOT WHERE THEY WERE BUT BOTH OF
THEM THE MAN AND THE CHILD THE PENITENT AND THE INNOCENT FELT THAT
THEY MUST KNEEL
THESE VOICES HAD THIS STRANGE CHARACTERISTIC THAT THEY DID NOT PREVENT
THE BUILDING FROM SEEMING TO BE DESERTED
IT WAS A SUPERNATURAL CHANT IN
AN UNINHABITED HOUSE
WHILE THESE VOICES WERE SINGING JEAN VALJEAN THOUGHT OF NOTHING
HE NO
LONGER BEHELD THE NIGHT HE BEHELD A BLUE SKY
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE
FELT THOSE WINGS WHICH WE ALL HAVE WITHIN US UNFOLDING
THE SONG DIED AWAY
IT MAY HAVE LASTED A LONG TIME
JEAN VALJEAN COULD
NOT HAVE TOLD
HOURS OF ECSTASY ARE NEVER MORE THAN A MOMENT
ALL FELL SILENT AGAIN
THERE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING IN THE STREET
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE GARDEN
THAT WHICH HAD MENACED THAT WHICH HAD
REASSURED HIM ALL HAD VANISHED
THE BREEZE SWAYED A FEW DRY WEEDS
ON THE CREST OF THE WALL AND THEY GAVE OUT A FAINT SWEET MELANCHOLY
SOUND
CHAPTER VII CONTINUATION OF THE ENIGMA
THE NIGHT WIND HAD RISEN WHICH INDICATED THAT IT MUST BE BETWEEN ONE
AND TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
POOR COSETTE SAID NOTHING
AS SHE HAD
SEATED HERSELF BESIDE HIM AND LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST HIM JEAN VALJEAN
HAD FANCIED THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP
HE BENT DOWN AND LOOKED AT HER
COSETTE'S EYES WERE WIDE OPEN AND HER THOUGHTFUL AIR PAINED JEAN
VALJEAN
SHE WAS STILL TREMBLING
ARE YOU SLEEPY SAID JEAN VALJEAN
I AM VERY COLD SHE REPLIED
A MOMENT LATER SHE RESUMED
IS SHE STILL THERE
WHO SAID JEAN VALJEAN
MADAME THENARDIER
JEAN VALJEAN HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN THE MEANS WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED TO
MAKE COSETTE KEEP SILENT
AH SAID HE SHE IS GONE
YOU NEED FEAR NOTHING FURTHER
THE CHILD SIGHED AS THOUGH A LOAD HAD BEEN LIFTED FROM HER BREAST
THE GROUND WAS DAMP THE SHED OPEN ON ALL SIDES THE BREEZE GREW MORE
KEEN EVERY INSTANT
THE GOODMAN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND WRAPPED IT ROUND
COSETTE
ARE YOU LESS COLD NOW SAID HE
OH YES FATHER
WELL WAIT FOR ME A MOMENT
I WILL SOON BE BACK
HE QUITTED THE RUIN AND CREPT ALONG THE LARGE BUILDING SEEKING A BETTER
SHELTER
HE CAME ACROSS DOORS BUT THEY WERE CLOSED
THERE WERE BARS AT
ALL THE WINDOWS OF THE GROUND FLOOR
JUST AFTER HE HAD TURNED THE INNER ANGLE OF THE EDIFICE HE OBSERVED
THAT HE WAS COMING TO SOME ARCHED WINDOWS WHERE HE PERCEIVED A LIGHT
HE STOOD ON TIPTOE AND PEEPED THROUGH ONE OF THESE WINDOWS
THEY ALL
OPENED ON A TOLERABLY VAST HALL PAVED WITH LARGE FLAGSTONES CUT UP
BY ARCADES AND PILLARS WHERE ONLY A TINY LIGHT AND GREAT SHADOWS WERE
VISIBLE
THE LIGHT CAME FROM A TAPER WHICH WAS BURNING IN ONE
CORNER
THE APARTMENT WAS DESERTED AND NOTHING WAS STIRRING IN IT
NEVERTHELESS BY DINT OF GAZING INTENTLY HE THOUGHT HE PERCEIVED ON THE
GROUND SOMETHING WHICH APPEARED TO BE COVERED WITH A WINDING SHEET AND
WHICH RESEMBLED A HUMAN FORM
THIS FORM WAS LYING FACE DOWNWARD FLAT
ON THE PAVEMENT WITH THE ARMS EXTENDED IN THE FORM OF A CROSS IN THE
IMMOBILITY OF DEATH
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID JUDGING FROM A SORT OF SERPENT
WHICH UNDULATED OVER THE FLOOR THAT THIS SINISTER FORM HAD A ROPE ROUND
ITS NECK
THE WHOLE CHAMBER WAS BATHED IN THAT MIST OF PLACES WHICH ARE SPARELY
ILLUMINATED WHICH ADDS TO HORROR
JEAN VALJEAN OFTEN SAID AFTERWARDS THAT ALTHOUGH MANY FUNEREAL
SPECTRES HAD CROSSED HIS PATH IN LIFE HE HAD NEVER BEHELD ANYTHING MORE
BLOOD CURDLING AND TERRIBLE THAN THAT ENIGMATICAL FORM ACCOMPLISHING
SOME INEXPLICABLE MYSTERY IN THAT GLOOMY PLACE AND BEHELD THUS AT
NIGHT
IT WAS ALARMING TO SUPPOSE THAT THAT THING WAS PERHAPS DEAD AND
STILL MORE ALARMING TO THINK THAT IT WAS PERHAPS ALIVE
HE HAD THE COURAGE TO PLASTER HIS FACE TO THE GLASS AND TO WATCH
WHETHER THE THING WOULD MOVE
IN SPITE OF HIS REMAINING THUS WHAT SEEMED
TO HIM A VERY LONG TIME THE OUTSTRETCHED FORM MADE NO MOVEMENT
ALL
AT ONCE HE FELT HIMSELF OVERPOWERED BY AN INEXPRESSIBLE TERROR AND HE
FLED
HE BEGAN TO RUN TOWARDS THE SHED NOT DARING TO LOOK BEHIND HIM
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IF HE TURNED HIS HEAD HE SHOULD SEE THAT FORM
FOLLOWING HIM WITH GREAT STRIDES AND WAVING ITS ARMS
HE REACHED THE RUIN ALL OUT OF BREATH
HIS KNEES WERE GIVING WAY BENEATH
HIM THE PERSPIRATION WAS POURING FROM HIM
WHERE WAS HE WHO COULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED ANYTHING LIKE THAT SORT OF
SEPULCHRE IN THE MIDST OF PARIS WHAT WAS THIS STRANGE HOUSE AN EDIFICE
FULL OF NOCTURNAL MYSTERY CALLING TO SOULS THROUGH THE DARKNESS WITH
THE VOICE OF ANGELS AND WHEN THEY CAME OFFERING THEM ABRUPTLY THAT
TERRIBLE VISION PROMISING TO OPEN THE RADIANT PORTALS OF HEAVEN AND
THEN OPENING THE HORRIBLE GATES OF THE TOMB AND IT ACTUALLY WAS AN
EDIFICE A HOUSE WHICH BORE A NUMBER ON THE STREET IT WAS NOT A DREAM
HE HAD TO TOUCH THE STONES TO CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT SUCH WAS THE FACT
COLD ANXIETY UNEASINESS THE EMOTIONS OF THE NIGHT HAD GIVEN HIM A
GENUINE FEVER AND ALL THESE IDEAS WERE CLASHING TOGETHER IN HIS BRAIN
HE STEPPED UP TO COSETTE
SHE WAS ASLEEP
CHAPTER VIII THE ENIGMA BECOMES DOUBLY MYSTERIOUS
THE CHILD HAD LAID HER HEAD ON A STONE AND FALLEN ASLEEP
HE SAT DOWN BESIDE HER AND BEGAN TO THINK
LITTLE BY LITTLE AS HE GAZED
AT HER HE GREW CALM AND REGAINED POSSESSION OF HIS FREEDOM OF MIND
HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THIS TRUTH THE FOUNDATION OF HIS LIFE HENCEFORTH
THAT SO LONG AS SHE WAS THERE SO LONG AS HE HAD HER NEAR HIM HE SHOULD
NEED NOTHING EXCEPT FOR HER HE SHOULD FEAR NOTHING EXCEPT FOR HER
HE
WAS NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS VERY COLD SINCE HE HAD TAKEN OFF HIS
COAT TO COVER HER
NEVERTHELESS ATHWART THIS REVERY INTO WHICH HE HAD FALLEN HE HAD HEARD
FOR SOME TIME A PECULIAR NOISE
IT WAS LIKE THE TINKLING OF A BELL
THIS
SOUND PROCEEDED FROM THE GARDEN
IT COULD BE HEARD DISTINCTLY THOUGH
FAINTLY
IT RESEMBLED THE FAINT VAGUE MUSIC PRODUCED BY THE BELLS OF
CATTLE AT NIGHT IN THE PASTURES
THIS NOISE MADE VALJEAN TURN ROUND
HE LOOKED AND SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME ONE IN THE GARDEN
A BEING RESEMBLING A MAN WAS WALKING AMID THE BELL GLASSES OF THE MELON
BEDS RISING STOOPING HALTING WITH REGULAR MOVEMENTS AS THOUGH HE
WERE DRAGGING OR SPREADING OUT SOMETHING ON THE GROUND
THIS PERSON
APPEARED TO LIMP
JEAN VALJEAN SHUDDERED WITH THE CONTINUAL TREMOR OF THE UNHAPPY
FOR
THEM EVERYTHING IS HOSTILE AND SUSPICIOUS
THEY DISTRUST THE DAY
BECAUSE IT ENABLES PEOPLE TO SEE THEM AND THE NIGHT BECAUSE IT AIDS
IN SURPRISING THEM
A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HE HAD SHIVERED BECAUSE THE
GARDEN WAS DESERTED AND NOW HE SHIVERED BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME ONE
THERE
HE FELL BACK FROM CHIMERICAL TERRORS TO REAL TERRORS
HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THAT JAVERT AND THE SPIES HAD PERHAPS NOT TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE THAT
THEY HAD NO DOUBT LEFT PEOPLE ON THE WATCH IN THE STREET THAT IF THIS
MAN SHOULD DISCOVER HIM IN THE GARDEN HE WOULD CRY OUT FOR HELP AGAINST
THIEVES AND DELIVER HIM UP
HE TOOK THE SLEEPING COSETTE GENTLY IN HIS
ARMS AND CARRIED HER BEHIND A HEAP OF OLD FURNITURE WHICH WAS OUT OF
USE IN THE MOST REMOTE CORNER OF THE SHED
COSETTE DID NOT STIR
FROM THAT POINT HE SCRUTINIZED THE APPEARANCE OF THE BEING IN THE
MELON PATCH
THE STRANGE THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THE SOUND OF THE BELL
FOLLOWED EACH OF THIS MAN'S MOVEMENTS
WHEN THE MAN APPROACHED THE
SOUND APPROACHED WHEN THE MAN RETREATED THE SOUND RETREATED IF HE
MADE ANY HASTY GESTURE A TREMOLO ACCOMPANIED THE GESTURE WHEN HE
HALTED THE SOUND CEASED
IT APPEARED EVIDENT THAT THE BELL WAS ATTACHED
TO THAT MAN BUT WHAT COULD THAT SIGNIFY WHO WAS THIS MAN WHO HAD A
BELL SUSPENDED ABOUT HIM LIKE A RAM OR AN OX
AS HE PUT THESE QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF HE TOUCHED COSETTE'S HANDS
THEY
WERE ICY COLD
AH GOOD GOD HE CRIED
HE SPOKE TO HER IN A LOW VOICE
COSETTE
SHE DID NOT OPEN HER EYES
HE SHOOK HER VIGOROUSLY
SHE DID NOT WAKE
IS SHE DEAD HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET QUIVERING
FROM HEAD TO FOOT
THE MOST FRIGHTFUL THOUGHTS RUSHED PELL MELL THROUGH HIS MIND
THERE
ARE MOMENTS WHEN HIDEOUS SURMISES ASSAIL US LIKE A COHORT OF FURIES AND
VIOLENTLY FORCE THE PARTITIONS OF OUR BRAINS
WHEN THOSE WE LOVE ARE IN
QUESTION OUR PRUDENCE INVENTS EVERY SORT OF MADNESS
HE REMEMBERED THAT
SLEEP IN THE OPEN AIR ON A COLD NIGHT MAY BE FATAL
COSETTE WAS PALE AND HAD FALLEN AT FULL LENGTH ON THE GROUND AT HIS
FEET WITHOUT A MOVEMENT
HE LISTENED TO HER BREATHING SHE STILL BREATHED BUT WITH A RESPIRATION
WHICH SEEMED TO HIM WEAK AND ON THE POINT OF EXTINCTION
HOW WAS HE TO WARM HER BACK TO LIFE HOW WAS HE TO ROUSE HER ALL THAT
WAS NOT CONNECTED WITH THIS VANISHED FROM HIS THOUGHTS
HE RUSHED WILDLY
FROM THE RUIN
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT COSETTE SHOULD BE IN BED AND BESIDE A
FIRE IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
CHAPTER IX THE MAN WITH THE BELL
HE WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE MAN WHOM HE SAW IN THE GARDEN
HE HAD TAKEN
IN HIS HAND THE ROLL OF SILVER WHICH WAS IN THE POCKET OF HIS WAISTCOAT
THE MAN'S HEAD WAS BENT DOWN AND HE DID NOT SEE HIM APPROACHING
IN A
FEW STRIDES JEAN VALJEAN STOOD BESIDE HIM
JEAN VALJEAN ACCOSTED HIM WITH THE CRY
ONE HUNDRED FRANCS
THE MAN GAVE A START AND RAISED HIS EYES
YOU CAN EARN A HUNDRED FRANCS WENT ON JEAN VALJEAN IF YOU WILL
GRANT ME SHELTER FOR THIS NIGHT
THE MOON SHONE FULL UPON JEAN VALJEAN'S TERRIFIED COUNTENANCE
WHAT SO IT IS YOU FATHER MADELEINE SAID THE MAN
THAT NAME THUS PRONOUNCED AT THAT OBSCURE HOUR IN THAT UNKNOWN SPOT
BY THAT STRANGE MAN MADE JEAN VALJEAN START BACK
HE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THAT
THE PERSON WHO THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS
A BENT AND LAME OLD MAN DRESSED ALMOST LIKE A PEASANT WHO WORE ON HIS
LEFT KNEE A LEATHER KNEE CAP WHENCE HUNG A MODERATELY LARGE BELL
HIS
FACE WHICH WAS IN THE SHADOW WAS NOT DISTINGUISHABLE
HOWEVER THE GOODMAN HAD REMOVED HIS CAP AND EXCLAIMED TREMBLING ALL
OVER
AH GOOD GOD HOW COME YOU HERE FATHER MADELEINE WHERE DID YOU ENTER
DIEU JESUS DID YOU FALL FROM HEAVEN THERE IS NO TROUBLE ABOUT THAT
IF EVER YOU DO FALL IT WILL BE FROM THERE
AND WHAT A STATE YOU ARE IN
YOU HAVE NO CRAVAT YOU HAVE NO HAT YOU HAVE NO COAT DO YOU KNOW YOU
WOULD HAVE FRIGHTENED ANY ONE WHO DID NOT KNOW YOU NO COAT LORD GOD
ARE THE SAINTS GOING MAD NOWADAYS BUT HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE
HIS WORDS TUMBLED OVER EACH OTHER
THE GOODMAN TALKED WITH A RUSTIC
VOLUBILITY IN WHICH THERE WAS NOTHING ALARMING
ALL THIS WAS UTTERED
WITH A MIXTURE OF STUPEFACTION AND NAIVE KINDLINESS
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HOUSE IS THIS DEMANDED JEAN VALJEAN
AH PARDIEU THIS IS TOO MUCH EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN
I AM THE PERSON
FOR WHOM YOU GOT THE PLACE HERE AND THIS HOUSE IS THE ONE WHERE YOU HAD
ME PLACED
WHAT YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE ME
NO SAID JEAN VALJEAN AND HOW HAPPENS IT THAT YOU KNOW ME
YOU SAVED MY LIFE SAID THE MAN
HE TURNED
A RAY OF MOONLIGHT OUTLINED HIS PROFILE AND JEAN VALJEAN
RECOGNIZED OLD FAUCHELEVENT
AH SAID JEAN VALJEAN SO IT IS YOU YES I RECOLLECT YOU
THAT IS VERY LUCKY SAID THE OLD MAN IN A REPROACHFUL TONE
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE RESUMED JEAN VALJEAN
WHY I AM COVERING MY MELONS OF COURSE
IN FACT AT THE MOMENT WHEN JEAN VALJEAN ACCOSTED HIM OLD FAUCHELEVENT
HELD IN HIS HAND THE END OF A STRAW MAT WHICH HE WAS OCCUPIED IN
SPREADING OVER THE MELON BED
DURING THE HOUR OR THEREABOUTS THAT HE HAD
BEEN IN THE GARDEN HE HAD ALREADY SPREAD OUT A NUMBER OF THEM
IT WAS
THIS OPERATION WHICH HAD CAUSED HIM TO EXECUTE THE PECULIAR MOVEMENTS
OBSERVED FROM THE SHED BY JEAN VALJEAN
HE CONTINUED
I SAID TO MYSELF 'THE MOON IS BRIGHT IT IS GOING TO FREEZE
WHAT IF I
WERE TO PUT MY MELONS INTO THEIR GREATCOATS AND HE ADDED LOOKING AT
JEAN VALJEAN WITH A BROAD SMILE PARDIEU YOU OUGHT TO HAVE DONE THE
SAME BUT HOW DO YOU COME HERE
JEAN VALJEAN FINDING HIMSELF KNOWN TO THIS MAN AT LEAST ONLY UNDER THE
NAME OF MADELEINE THENCEFORTH ADVANCED ONLY WITH CAUTION
HE MULTIPLIED
HIS QUESTIONS
STRANGE TO SAY THEIR ROLES SEEMED TO BE REVERSED
IT WAS
HE THE INTRUDER WHO INTERROGATED
AND WHAT IS THIS BELL WHICH YOU WEAR ON YOUR KNEE
THIS REPLIED FAUCHELEVENT IS SO THAT I MAY BE AVOIDED
WHAT SO THAT YOU MAY BE AVOIDED
OLD FAUCHELEVENT WINKED WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE AIR
AH GOODNESS THERE ARE ONLY WOMEN IN THIS HOUSE MANY YOUNG GIRLS
IT
APPEARS THAT I SHOULD BE A DANGEROUS PERSON TO MEET
THE BELL GIVES THEM
WARNING
WHEN I COME THEY GO
WHAT HOUSE IS THIS
COME YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH
BUT I DO NOT
NOT WHEN YOU GOT ME THE PLACE HERE AS GARDENER
ANSWER ME AS THOUGH I KNEW NOTHING
WELL THEN THIS IS THE PETIT PICPUS CONVENT
MEMORIES RECURRED TO JEAN VALJEAN
CHANCE THAT IS TO SAY PROVIDENCE
HAD CAST HIM INTO PRECISELY THAT CONVENT IN THE QUARTIER SAINT ANTOINE
WHERE OLD FAUCHELEVENT CRIPPLED BY THE FALL FROM HIS CART HAD BEEN
ADMITTED ON HIS RECOMMENDATION TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY
HE REPEATED AS
THOUGH TALKING TO HIMSELF
THE PETIT PICPUS CONVENT
EXACTLY RETURNED OLD FAUCHELEVENT
BUT TO COME TO THE POINT HOW THE
DEUCE DID YOU MANAGE TO GET IN HERE YOU FATHER MADELEINE NO MATTER IF
YOU ARE A SAINT YOU ARE A MAN AS WELL AND NO MAN ENTERS HERE
YOU CERTAINLY ARE HERE
THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME
STILL SAID JEAN VALJEAN I MUST STAY HERE
AH GOOD GOD CRIED FAUCHELEVENT
JEAN VALJEAN DREW NEAR TO THE OLD MAN AND SAID TO HIM IN A GRAVE
VOICE
FATHER FAUCHELEVENT I SAVED YOUR LIFE
I WAS THE FIRST TO RECALL IT RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT
WELL YOU CAN DO TO DAY FOR ME THAT WHICH I DID FOR YOU IN THE OLDEN
DAYS
FAUCHELEVENT TOOK IN HIS AGED TREMBLING AND WRINKLED HANDS JEAN
VALJEAN'S TWO ROBUST HANDS AND STOOD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AS THOUGH
INCAPABLE OF SPEAKING
AT LENGTH HE EXCLAIMED
OH THAT WOULD BE A BLESSING FROM THE GOOD GOD IF I COULD MAKE YOU
SOME LITTLE RETURN FOR THAT SAVE YOUR LIFE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE DISPOSE
OF THE OLD MAN
A WONDERFUL JOY HAD TRANSFIGURED THIS OLD MAN
HIS COUNTENANCE SEEMED TO
EMIT A RAY OF LIGHT
WHAT DO YOU WISH ME TO DO HE RESUMED
THAT I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU
YOU HAVE A CHAMBER
I HAVE AN ISOLATED HOVEL YONDER BEHIND THE RUINS OF THE OLD CONVENT
IN A CORNER WHICH NO ONE EVER LOOKS INTO
THERE ARE THREE ROOMS IN IT
THE HUT WAS IN FACT SO WELL HIDDEN BEHIND THE RUINS AND SO CLEVERLY
ARRANGED TO PREVENT IT BEING SEEN THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT PERCEIVED
IT
GOOD SAID JEAN VALJEAN
NOW I AM GOING TO ASK TWO THINGS OF YOU
WHAT ARE THEY MR
MAYOR
IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU ARE NOT TO TELL ANY ONE WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT ME
IN THE SECOND YOU ARE NOT TO TRY TO FIND OUT ANYTHING MORE
AS YOU PLEASE
I KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO NOTHING THAT IS NOT HONEST
THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A MAN AFTER THE GOOD GOD'S HEART
AND THEN
MOREOVER YOU IT WAS WHO PLACED ME HERE
THAT CONCERNS YOU
I AM AT YOUR
SERVICE
THAT IS SETTLED THEN
NOW COME WITH ME
WE WILL GO AND GET THE CHILD
AH SAID FAUCHELEVENT SO THERE IS A CHILD
HE ADDED NOT A WORD FURTHER AND FOLLOWED JEAN VALJEAN AS A DOG FOLLOWS
HIS MASTER
LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS COSETTE WHO HAD GROWN ROSY AGAIN
BEFORE THE FLAME OF A GOOD FIRE WAS LYING ASLEEP IN THE OLD GARDENER'S
BED
JEAN VALJEAN HAD PUT ON HIS CRAVAT AND COAT ONCE MORE HIS HAT
WHICH HE HAD FLUNG OVER THE WALL HAD BEEN FOUND AND PICKED UP
WHILE
JEAN VALJEAN WAS PUTTING ON HIS COAT FAUCHELEVENT HAD REMOVED THE
BELL AND KNEECAP WHICH NOW HUNG ON A NAIL BESIDE A VINTAGE BASKET THAT
ADORNED THE WALL
THE TWO MEN WERE WARMING THEMSELVES WITH THEIR ELBOWS
RESTING ON A TABLE UPON WHICH FAUCHELEVENT HAD PLACED A BIT OF CHEESE
BLACK BREAD A BOTTLE OF WINE AND TWO GLASSES AND THE OLD MAN WAS
SAYING TO JEAN VALJEAN AS HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE LATTER'S KNEE
AH FATHER MADELEINE YOU DID NOT RECOGNIZE ME IMMEDIATELY YOU SAVE
PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THEN YOU FORGET THEM THAT IS BAD BUT THEY REMEMBER
YOU YOU ARE AN INGRATE
CHAPTER X WHICH EXPLAINS HOW JAVERT GOT ON THE SCENT
THE EVENTS OF WHICH WE HAVE JUST BEHELD THE REVERSE SIDE SO TO SPEAK
HAD COME ABOUT IN THE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE MANNER
WHEN JEAN VALJEAN ON THE EVENING OF THE VERY DAY WHEN JAVERT HAD
ARRESTED HIM BESIDE FANTINE'S DEATH BED HAD ESCAPED FROM THE TOWN JAIL
OF M
SUR M THE POLICE HAD SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD BETAKEN HIMSELF TO
PARIS
PARIS IS A MAELSTROM WHERE EVERYTHING IS LOST AND EVERYTHING
DISAPPEARS IN THIS BELLY OF THE WORLD AS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA
NO
FOREST HIDES A MAN AS DOES THAT CROWD
FUGITIVES OF EVERY SORT KNOW
THIS
THEY GO TO PARIS AS TO AN ABYSS THERE ARE GULFS WHICH SAVE
THE
POLICE KNOW IT ALSO AND IT IS IN PARIS THAT THEY SEEK WHAT THEY
HAVE LOST ELSEWHERE
THEY SOUGHT THE EX MAYOR OF M
SUR M
JAVERT WAS
SUMMONED TO PARIS TO THROW LIGHT ON THEIR RESEARCHES
JAVERT HAD IN
FACT RENDERED POWERFUL ASSISTANCE IN THE RECAPTURE OF JEAN VALJEAN
JAVERT'S ZEAL AND INTELLIGENCE ON THAT OCCASION HAD BEEN REMARKED BY
M
CHABOUILLET SECRETARY OF THE PREFECTURE UNDER COMTE ANGLES
M
CHABOUILLET WHO HAD MOREOVER ALREADY BEEN JAVERT'S PATRON HAD THE
INSPECTOR OF M
SUR M
ATTACHED TO THE POLICE FORCE OF PARIS
THERE
JAVERT RENDERED HIMSELF USEFUL IN DIVERS AND THOUGH THE WORD MAY SEEM
STRANGE FOR SUCH SERVICES HONORABLE MANNERS
HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF JEAN VALJEAN THE WOLF OF TO DAY CAUSES THESE
DOGS WHO ARE ALWAYS ON THE CHASE TO FORGET THE WOLF OF YESTERDAY WHEN
IN DECEMBER 1823 HE READ A NEWSPAPER HE WHO NEVER READ NEWSPAPERS
BUT JAVERT A MONARCHICAL MAN HAD A DESIRE TO KNOW THE PARTICULARS OF
THE TRIUMPHAL ENTRY OF THE PRINCE GENERALISSIMO INTO BAYONNE
JUST AS
HE WAS FINISHING THE ARTICLE WHICH INTERESTED HIM A NAME THE NAME OF
JEAN VALJEAN ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION AT THE BOTTOM OF A PAGE
THE PAPER
ANNOUNCED THAT THE CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN WAS DEAD AND PUBLISHED THE FACT
IN SUCH FORMAL TERMS THAT JAVERT DID NOT DOUBT IT
HE CONFINED HIMSELF
TO THE REMARK THAT'S A GOOD ENTRY THEN HE THREW ASIDE THE PAPER AND
THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT
SOME TIME AFTERWARDS IT CHANCED THAT A POLICE REPORT WAS TRANSMITTED
FROM THE PREFECTURE OF THE SEINE ET OISE TO THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE IN
PARIS CONCERNING THE ABDUCTION OF A CHILD WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE UNDER
PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES AS IT WAS SAID IN THE COMMUNE OF MONTFERMEIL
A LITTLE GIRL OF SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS OF AGE THE REPORT SAID WHO HAD
BEEN INTRUSTED BY HER MOTHER TO AN INN KEEPER OF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD HAD
BEEN STOLEN BY A STRANGER THIS CHILD ANSWERED TO THE NAME OF COSETTE
AND WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A GIRL NAMED FANTINE WHO HAD DIED IN THE
HOSPITAL IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHERE OR WHEN
THIS REPORT CAME UNDER JAVERT'S EYE AND SET HIM TO THINKING
THE NAME OF FANTINE WAS WELL KNOWN TO HIM
HE REMEMBERED THAT JEAN
VALJEAN HAD MADE HIM JAVERT BURST INTO LAUGHTER BY ASKING HIM FOR A
RESPITE OF THREE DAYS FOR THE PURPOSE OF GOING TO FETCH THAT CREATURE'S
CHILD
HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN PARIS
AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN HE WAS STEPPING INTO THE COACH FOR MONTFERMEIL
SOME SIGNS HAD MADE HIM SUSPECT AT THE TIME THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND
OCCASION OF HIS ENTERING THAT COACH AND THAT HE HAD ALREADY ON THE
PREVIOUS DAY MADE AN EXCURSION TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THAT VILLAGE FOR
HE HAD NOT BEEN SEEN IN THE VILLAGE ITSELF
WHAT HAD HE BEEN INTENDING
TO DO IN THAT REGION OF MONTFERMEIL IT COULD NOT EVEN BE SURMISED
JAVERT UNDERSTOOD IT NOW
FANTINE'S DAUGHTER WAS THERE
JEAN VALJEAN WAS
GOING THERE IN SEARCH OF HER
AND NOW THIS CHILD HAD BEEN STOLEN BY A
STRANGER WHO COULD THAT STRANGER BE COULD IT BE JEAN VALJEAN BUT JEAN
VALJEAN WAS DEAD
JAVERT WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO ANYBODY TOOK THE
COACH FROM THE PEWTER PLATTER CUL DE SAC DE LA PLANCHETTE AND MADE A
TRIP TO MONTFERMEIL
HE EXPECTED TO FIND A GREAT DEAL OF LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT THERE HE FOUND
A GREAT DEAL OF OBSCURITY
FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS THE THENARDIERS HAD CHATTERED IN THEIR RAGE
THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE LARK HAD CREATED A SENSATION IN THE VILLAGE
HE
IMMEDIATELY OBTAINED NUMEROUS VERSIONS OF THE STORY WHICH ENDED IN THE
ABDUCTION OF A CHILD
HENCE THE POLICE REPORT
BUT THEIR FIRST VEXATION
HAVING PASSED OFF THENARDIER WITH HIS WONDERFUL INSTINCT HAD
VERY QUICKLY COMPREHENDED THAT IT IS NEVER ADVISABLE TO STIR UP THE
PROSECUTOR OF THE CROWN AND THAT HIS COMPLAINTS WITH REGARD TO THE
ABDUCTION OF COSETTE WOULD HAVE AS THEIR FIRST RESULT TO FIX UPON
HIMSELF AND UPON MANY DARK AFFAIRS WHICH HE HAD ON HAND THE GLITTERING
EYE OF JUSTICE
THE LAST THING THAT OWLS DESIRE IS TO HAVE A CANDLE
BROUGHT TO THEM
AND IN THE FIRST PLACE HOW EXPLAIN THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED
FRANCS WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED HE TURNED SQUARELY ROUND PUT A GAG ON
HIS WIFE'S MOUTH AND FEIGNED ASTONISHMENT WHEN THE STOLEN CHILD WAS
MENTIONED TO HIM
HE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING ABOUT IT NO DOUBT HE HAD
GRUMBLED FOR AWHILE AT HAVING THAT DEAR LITTLE CREATURE TAKEN FROM HIM
SO HASTILY HE SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO KEEP HER TWO OR THREE DAYS LONGER
OUT OF TENDERNESS BUT HER GRANDFATHER HAD COME FOR HER IN THE MOST
NATURAL WAY IN THE WORLD
HE ADDED THE GRANDFATHER WHICH PRODUCED A
GOOD EFFECT
THIS WAS THE STORY THAT JAVERT HIT UPON WHEN HE ARRIVED AT
MONTFERMEIL
THE GRANDFATHER CAUSED JEAN VALJEAN TO VANISH
NEVERTHELESS JAVERT DROPPED A FEW QUESTIONS LIKE PLUMMETS INTO
THENARDIER'S HISTORY
WHO WAS THAT GRANDFATHER AND WHAT WAS HIS NAME
THENARDIER REPLIED WITH SIMPLICITY HE IS A WEALTHY FARMER
I SAW HIS
PASSPORT
I THINK HIS NAME WAS M
GUILLAUME LAMBERT
LAMBERT IS A RESPECTABLE AND EXTREMELY REASSURING NAME
THEREUPON JAVERT
RETURNED TO PARIS
JEAN VALJEAN IS CERTAINLY DEAD SAID HE AND I AM A NINNY
HE HAD AGAIN BEGUN TO FORGET THIS HISTORY WHEN IN THE COURSE OF
MARCH 1824 HE HEARD OF A SINGULAR PERSONAGE WHO DWELT IN THE PARISH OF
SAINT MEDARD AND WHO HAD BEEN SURNAMED THE MENDICANT WHO GIVES ALMS
THIS PERSON THE STORY RAN WAS A MAN OF MEANS WHOSE NAME NO ONE KNEW
EXACTLY AND WHO LIVED ALONE WITH A LITTLE GIRL OF EIGHT YEARS WHO
KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HERSELF SAVE THAT SHE HAD COME FROM MONTFERMEIL
MONTFERMEIL THAT NAME WAS ALWAYS COMING UP AND IT MADE JAVERT PRICK
UP HIS EARS
AN OLD BEGGAR POLICE SPY AN EX BEADLE TO WHOM THIS PERSON
HAD GIVEN ALMS ADDED A FEW MORE DETAILS
THIS GENTLEMAN OF PROPERTY WAS
VERY SHY NEVER COMING OUT EXCEPT IN THE EVENING SPEAKING TO NO ONE
EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY TO THE POOR AND NEVER ALLOWING ANY ONE TO APPROACH
HIM
HE WORE A HORRIBLE OLD YELLOW FROCK COAT WHICH WAS WORTH MANY
MILLIONS BEING ALL WADDED WITH BANK BILLS
THIS PIQUED JAVERT'S
CURIOSITY IN A DECIDED MANNER
IN ORDER TO GET A CLOSE LOOK AT THIS
FANTASTIC GENTLEMAN WITHOUT ALARMING HIM HE BORROWED THE BEADLE'S
OUTFIT FOR A DAY AND THE PLACE WHERE THE OLD SPY WAS IN THE HABIT OF
CROUCHING EVERY EVENING WHINING ORISONS THROUGH HIS NOSE AND PLAYING
THE SPY UNDER COVER OF PRAYER
THE SUSPECTED INDIVIDUAL DID INDEED APPROACH JAVERT THUS DISGUISED
AND BESTOW ALMS ON HIM
AT THAT MOMENT JAVERT RAISED HIS HEAD AND THE
SHOCK WHICH JEAN VALJEAN RECEIVED ON RECOGNIZING JAVERT WAS EQUAL TO THE
ONE RECEIVED BY JAVERT WHEN HE THOUGHT HE RECOGNIZED JEAN VALJEAN
HOWEVER THE DARKNESS MIGHT HAVE MISLED HIM JEAN VALJEAN'S DEATH WAS
OFFICIAL JAVERT CHERISHED VERY GRAVE DOUBTS AND WHEN IN DOUBT JAVERT
THE MAN OF SCRUPLES NEVER LAID A FINGER ON ANY ONE'S COLLAR
HE FOLLOWED HIS MAN TO THE GORBEAU HOUSE AND GOT THE OLD WOMAN TO
TALKING WHICH WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER
THE OLD WOMAN CONFIRMED THE FACT
REGARDING THE COAT LINED WITH MILLIONS AND NARRATED TO HIM THE EPISODE
OF THE THOUSAND FRANC BILL
SHE HAD SEEN IT SHE HAD HANDLED IT JAVERT
HIRED A ROOM THAT EVENING HE INSTALLED HIMSELF IN IT
HE CAME AND
LISTENED AT THE MYSTERIOUS LODGER'S DOOR HOPING TO CATCH THE SOUND OF
HIS VOICE BUT JEAN VALJEAN SAW HIS CANDLE THROUGH THE KEY HOLE AND
FOILED THE SPY BY KEEPING SILENT
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY JEAN VALJEAN DECAMPED BUT THE NOISE MADE BY THE
FALL OF THE FIVE FRANC PIECE WAS NOTICED BY THE OLD WOMAN WHO HEARING
THE RATTLING OF COIN SUSPECTED THAT HE MIGHT BE INTENDING TO LEAVE AND
MADE HASTE TO WARN JAVERT
AT NIGHT WHEN JEAN VALJEAN CAME OUT JAVERT
WAS WAITING FOR HIM BEHIND THE TREES OF THE BOULEVARD WITH TWO MEN
JAVERT HAD DEMANDED ASSISTANCE AT THE PREFECTURE BUT HE HAD NOT
MENTIONED THE NAME OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM HE HOPED TO SEIZE THAT WAS
HIS SECRET AND HE HAD KEPT IT FOR THREE REASONS IN THE FIRST PLACE
BECAUSE THE SLIGHTEST INDISCRETION MIGHT PUT JEAN VALJEAN ON THE ALERT
NEXT BECAUSE TO LAY HANDS ON AN EX CONVICT WHO HAD MADE HIS ESCAPE
AND WAS REPUTED DEAD ON A CRIMINAL WHOM JUSTICE HAD FORMERLY CLASSED
FOREVER AS AMONG MALEFACTORS OF THE MOST DANGEROUS SORT WAS A
MAGNIFICENT SUCCESS WHICH THE OLD MEMBERS OF THE PARISIAN POLICE WOULD
ASSUREDLY NOT LEAVE TO A NEW COMER LIKE JAVERT AND HE WAS AFRAID OF
BEING DEPRIVED OF HIS CONVICT AND LASTLY BECAUSE JAVERT BEING AN
ARTIST HAD A TASTE FOR THE UNFORESEEN
HE HATED THOSE WELL HERALDED
SUCCESSES WHICH ARE TALKED OF LONG IN ADVANCE AND HAVE HAD THE BLOOM
BRUSHED OFF
HE PREFERRED TO ELABORATE HIS MASTERPIECES IN THE DARK AND
TO UNVEIL THEM SUDDENLY AT THE LAST
JAVERT HAD FOLLOWED JEAN VALJEAN FROM TREE TO TREE THEN FROM CORNER
TO CORNER OF THE STREET AND HAD NOT LOST SIGHT OF HIM FOR A SINGLE
INSTANT EVEN AT THE MOMENTS WHEN JEAN VALJEAN BELIEVED HIMSELF TO
BE THE MOST SECURE JAVERT'S EYE HAD BEEN ON HIM
WHY HAD NOT JAVERT
ARRESTED JEAN VALJEAN BECAUSE HE WAS STILL IN DOUBT
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THAT EPOCH THE POLICE WAS NOT PRECISELY
AT ITS EASE THE FREE PRESS EMBARRASSED IT SEVERAL ARBITRARY ARRESTS
DENOUNCED BY THE NEWSPAPERS HAD ECHOED EVEN AS FAR AS THE CHAMBERS AND
HAD RENDERED THE PREFECTURE TIMID
INTERFERENCE WITH INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY
WAS A GRAVE MATTER
THE POLICE AGENTS WERE AFRAID OF MAKING A MISTAKE
THE PREFECT LAID THE BLAME ON THEM A MISTAKE MEANT DISMISSAL
THE
READER CAN IMAGINE THE EFFECT WHICH THIS BRIEF PARAGRAPH REPRODUCED
BY TWENTY NEWSPAPERS WOULD HAVE CAUSED IN PARIS YESTERDAY AN AGED
GRANDFATHER WITH WHITE HAIR A RESPECTABLE AND WELL TO DO GENTLEMAN
WHO WAS WALKING WITH HIS GRANDCHILD AGED EIGHT WAS ARRESTED AND
CONDUCTED TO THE AGENCY OF THE PREFECTURE AS AN ESCAPED CONVICT
LET US REPEAT IN ADDITION THAT JAVERT HAD SCRUPLES OF HIS OWN
INJUNCTIONS OF HIS CONSCIENCE WERE ADDED TO THE INJUNCTIONS OF THE
PREFECT
HE WAS REALLY IN DOUBT
JEAN VALJEAN TURNED HIS BACK ON HIM AND WALKED IN THE DARK
SADNESS UNEASINESS ANXIETY DEPRESSION THIS FRESH MISFORTUNE OF BEING
FORCED TO FLEE BY NIGHT TO SEEK A CHANCE REFUGE IN PARIS FOR COSETTE
AND HIMSELF THE NECESSITY OF REGULATING HIS PACE TO THE PACE OF
THE CHILD ALL THIS WITHOUT HIS BEING AWARE OF IT HAD ALTERED JEAN
VALJEAN'S WALK AND IMPRESSED ON HIS BEARING SUCH SENILITY THAT THE
POLICE THEMSELVES INCARNATE IN THE PERSON OF JAVERT MIGHT AND DID IN
FACT MAKE A MISTAKE
THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF APPROACHING TOO CLOSE HIS
COSTUME OF AN EMIGRE PRECEPTOR THE DECLARATION OF THENARDIER WHICH MADE
A GRANDFATHER OF HIM AND FINALLY THE BELIEF IN HIS DEATH IN PRISON
ADDED STILL FURTHER TO THE UNCERTAINTY WHICH GATHERED THICK IN JAVERT'S
MIND
FOR AN INSTANT IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO MAKE AN ABRUPT DEMAND FOR HIS
PAPERS BUT IF THE MAN WAS NOT JEAN VALJEAN AND IF THIS MAN WAS NOT A
GOOD HONEST OLD FELLOW LIVING ON HIS INCOME HE WAS PROBABLY SOME MERRY
BLADE DEEPLY AND CUNNINGLY IMPLICATED IN THE OBSCURE WEB OF PARISIAN
MISDEEDS SOME CHIEF OF A DANGEROUS BAND WHO GAVE ALMS TO CONCEAL
HIS OTHER TALENTS WHICH WAS AN OLD DODGE
HE HAD TRUSTY FELLOWS
ACCOMPLICES' RETREATS IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES IN WHICH HE WOULD NO
DOUBT TAKE REFUGE
ALL THESE TURNS WHICH HE WAS MAKING THROUGH THE
STREETS SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS NOT A SIMPLE AND HONEST MAN
TO
ARREST HIM TOO HASTILY WOULD BE TO KILL THE HEN THAT LAID THE GOLDEN
EGGS WHERE WAS THE INCONVENIENCE IN WAITING JAVERT WAS VERY SURE THAT
HE WOULD NOT ESCAPE
THUS HE PROCEEDED IN A TOLERABLY PERPLEXED STATE OF MIND PUTTING TO
HIMSELF A HUNDRED QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS ENIGMATICAL PERSONAGE
IT WAS ONLY QUITE LATE IN THE RUE DE PONTOISE THAT THANKS TO THE
BRILLIANT LIGHT THROWN FROM A DRAM SHOP HE DECIDEDLY RECOGNIZED JEAN
VALJEAN
THERE ARE IN THIS WORLD TWO BEINGS WHO GIVE A PROFOUND START THE
MOTHER WHO RECOVERS HER CHILD AND THE TIGER WHO RECOVERS HIS PREY
JAVERT GAVE THAT PROFOUND START
AS SOON AS HE HAD POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED JEAN VALJEAN THE FORMIDABLE
CONVICT HE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WERE ONLY THREE OF THEM AND HE ASKED
FOR REINFORCEMENTS AT THE POLICE STATION OF THE RUE DE PONTOISE
ONE
PUTS ON GLOVES BEFORE GRASPING A THORN CUDGEL
THIS DELAY AND THE HALT AT THE CARREFOUR ROLLIN TO CONSULT WITH HIS
AGENTS CAME NEAR CAUSING HIM TO LOSE THE TRAIL
HE SPEEDILY DIVINED
HOWEVER THAT JEAN VALJEAN WOULD WANT TO PUT THE RIVER BETWEEN HIS
PURSUERS AND HIMSELF
HE BENT HIS HEAD AND REFLECTED LIKE A BLOOD HOUND
WHO PUTS HIS NOSE TO THE GROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT HE IS ON THE RIGHT
SCENT
JAVERT WITH HIS POWERFUL RECTITUDE OF INSTINCT WENT STRAIGHT TO
THE BRIDGE OF AUSTERLITZ
A WORD WITH THE TOLL KEEPER FURNISHED HIM WITH
THE INFORMATION WHICH HE REQUIRED HAVE YOU SEEN A MAN WITH A LITTLE
GIRL I MADE HIM PAY TWO SOUS REPLIED THE TOLL KEEPER
JAVERT
REACHED THE BRIDGE IN SEASON TO SEE JEAN VALJEAN TRAVERSE THE SMALL
ILLUMINATED SPOT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WATER LEADING COSETTE BY
THE HAND
HE SAW HIM ENTER THE RUE DU CHEMIN VERT SAINT ANTOINE HE
REMEMBERED THE CUL DE SAC GENROT ARRANGED THERE LIKE A TRAP AND OF THE
SOLE EXIT OF THE RUE DROIT MUR INTO THE RUE PETIT PICPUS
HE MADE SURE
OF HIS BACK BURROWS AS HUNTSMEN SAY HE HASTILY DESPATCHED ONE OF HIS
AGENTS BY A ROUNDABOUT WAY TO GUARD THAT ISSUE
A PATROL WHICH WAS
RETURNING TO THE ARSENAL POST HAVING PASSED HIM HE MADE A REQUISITION
ON IT AND CAUSED IT TO ACCOMPANY HIM
IN SUCH GAMES SOLDIERS ARE ACES
MOREOVER THE PRINCIPLE IS THAT IN ORDER TO GET THE BEST OF A WILD
BOAR ONE MUST EMPLOY THE SCIENCE OF VENERY AND PLENTY OF DOGS
THESE
COMBINATIONS HAVING BEEN EFFECTED FEELING THAT JEAN VALJEAN WAS CAUGHT
BETWEEN THE BLIND ALLEY GENROT ON THE RIGHT HIS AGENT ON THE LEFT AND
HIMSELF JAVERT IN THE REAR HE TOOK A PINCH OF SNUFF
THEN HE BEGAN THE GAME
HE EXPERIENCED ONE ECSTATIC AND INFERNAL MOMENT
HE ALLOWED HIS MAN TO GO ON AHEAD KNOWING THAT HE HAD HIM SAFE BUT
DESIROUS OF POSTPONING THE MOMENT OF ARREST AS LONG AS POSSIBLE HAPPY
AT THE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS TAKEN AND YET AT SEEING HIM FREE GLOATING
OVER HIM WITH HIS GAZE WITH THAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF THE SPIDER WHICH
ALLOWS THE FLY TO FLUTTER AND OF THE CAT WHICH LETS THE MOUSE RUN
CLAWS AND TALONS POSSESS A MONSTROUS SENSUALITY THE OBSCURE MOVEMENTS
OF THE CREATURE IMPRISONED IN THEIR PINCERS
WHAT A DELIGHT THIS
STRANGLING IS
JAVERT WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF
THE MESHES OF HIS NET WERE STOUTLY KNOTTED
HE WAS SURE OF SUCCESS ALL HE HAD TO DO NOW WAS TO CLOSE HIS HAND
ACCOMPANIED AS HE WAS THE VERY IDEA OF RESISTANCE WAS IMPOSSIBLE
HOWEVER VIGOROUS ENERGETIC AND DESPERATE JEAN VALJEAN MIGHT BE
ILLUSTRATION JAVERT ON THE HUNT 2B5 10 JAVERT ON THE HUNT
JAVERT ADVANCED SLOWLY SOUNDING SEARCHING ON HIS WAY ALL THE NOOKS OF
THE STREET LIKE SO MANY POCKETS OF THIEVES
WHEN HE REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE WEB HE FOUND THE FLY NO LONGER THERE
HIS EXASPERATION CAN BE IMAGINED
HE INTERROGATED HIS SENTINEL OF THE RUES DROIT MUR AND PETIT PICPUS
THAT AGENT WHO HAD REMAINED IMPERTURBABLY AT HIS POST HAD NOT SEEN THE
MAN PASS
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT A STAG IS LOST HEAD AND HORNS THAT IS TO
SAY HE ESCAPES ALTHOUGH HE HAS THE PACK ON HIS VERY HEELS AND THEN THE
OLDEST HUNTSMEN KNOW NOT WHAT TO SAY
DUVIVIER LIGNIVILLE AND DESPREZ
HALT SHORT
IN A DISCOMFITURE OF THIS SORT ARTONGE EXCLAIMS IT WAS
NOT A STAG BUT A SORCERER JAVERT WOULD HAVE LIKED TO UTTER THE SAME
CRY
HIS DISAPPOINTMENT BORDERED FOR A MOMENT ON DESPAIR AND RAGE
IT IS CERTAIN THAT NAPOLEON MADE MISTAKES DURING THE WAR WITH RUSSIA
THAT ALEXANDER COMMITTED BLUNDERS IN THE WAR IN INDIA THAT CAESAR MADE
MISTAKES IN THE WAR IN AFRICA THAT CYRUS WAS AT FAULT IN THE WAR
IN SCYTHIA AND THAT JAVERT BLUNDERED IN THIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST JEAN
VALJEAN
HE WAS WRONG PERHAPS IN HESITATING IN HIS RECOGNITION OF THE
EXCONVICT
THE FIRST GLANCE SHOULD HAVE SUFFICED HIM
HE WAS WRONG IN
NOT ARRESTING HIM PURELY AND SIMPLY IN THE OLD BUILDING HE WAS WRONG
IN NOT ARRESTING HIM WHEN HE POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED HIM IN THE RUE DE
PONTOISE
HE WAS WRONG IN TAKING COUNSEL WITH HIS AUXILIARIES IN THE
FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON IN THE CARREFOUR ROLLIN
ADVICE IS CERTAINLY
USEFUL IT IS A GOOD THING TO KNOW AND TO INTERROGATE THOSE OF THE DOGS
WHO DESERVE CONFIDENCE BUT THE HUNTER CANNOT BE TOO CAUTIOUS WHEN HE IS
CHASING UNEASY ANIMALS LIKE THE WOLF AND THE CONVICT
JAVERT BY TAKING
TOO MUCH THOUGHT AS TO HOW HE SHOULD SET THE BLOODHOUNDS OF THE PACK ON
THE TRAIL ALARMED THE BEAST BY GIVING HIM WIND OF THE DART AND SO
MADE HIM RUN
ABOVE ALL HE WAS WRONG IN THAT AFTER HE HAD PICKED UP THE
SCENT AGAIN ON THE BRIDGE OF AUSTERLITZ HE PLAYED THAT FORMIDABLE AND
PUERILE GAME OF KEEPING SUCH A MAN AT THE END OF A THREAD
HE THOUGHT
HIMSELF STRONGER THAN HE WAS AND BELIEVED THAT HE COULD PLAY AT THE
GAME OF THE MOUSE AND THE LION
AT THE SAME TIME HE RECKONED HIMSELF
AS TOO WEAK WHEN HE JUDGED IT NECESSARY TO OBTAIN REINFORCEMENT
FATAL
PRECAUTION WASTE OF PRECIOUS TIME JAVERT COMMITTED ALL THESE BLUNDERS
AND NONE THE LESS WAS ONE OF THE CLEVEREST AND MOST CORRECT SPIES THAT
EVER EXISTED
HE WAS IN THE FULL FORCE OF THE TERM WHAT IS CALLED IN
VENERY A KNOWING DOG
BUT WHAT IS THERE THAT IS PERFECT
GREAT STRATEGISTS HAVE THEIR ECLIPSES
THE GREATEST FOLLIES ARE OFTEN COMPOSED LIKE THE LARGEST ROPES OF
A MULTITUDE OF STRANDS
TAKE THE CABLE THREAD BY THREAD TAKE ALL THE
PETTY DETERMINING MOTIVES SEPARATELY AND YOU CAN BREAK THEM ONE AFTER
THE OTHER AND YOU SAY THAT IS ALL THERE IS OF IT BRAID THEM TWIST
THEM TOGETHER THE RESULT IS ENORMOUS IT IS ATTILA HESITATING BETWEEN
MARCIAN ON THE EAST AND VALENTINIAN ON THE WEST IT IS HANNIBAL TARRYING
AT CAPUA IT IS DANTON FALLING ASLEEP AT ARCIS SUR AUBE
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE EVEN AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE SAW THAT JEAN VALJEAN
HAD ESCAPED HIM JAVERT DID NOT LOSE HIS HEAD
SURE THAT THE CONVICT WHO
HAD BROKEN HIS BAN COULD NOT BE FAR OFF HE ESTABLISHED SENTINELS HE
ORGANIZED TRAPS AND AMBUSCADES AND BEAT THE QUARTER ALL THAT NIGHT
THE
FIRST THING HE SAW WAS THE DISORDER IN THE STREET LANTERN WHOSE ROPE
HAD BEEN CUT
A PRECIOUS SIGN WHICH HOWEVER LED HIM ASTRAY SINCE IT
CAUSED HIM TO TURN ALL HIS RESEARCHES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CUL DE SAC
GENROT
IN THIS BLIND ALLEY THERE WERE TOLERABLY LOW WALLS WHICH ABUTTED
ON GARDENS WHOSE BOUNDS ADJOINED THE IMMENSE STRETCHES OF WASTE LAND
JEAN VALJEAN EVIDENTLY MUST HAVE FLED IN THAT DIRECTION
THE FACT IS
THAT HAD HE PENETRATED A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE CUL DE SAC GENROT HE
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE DONE SO AND HAVE BEEN LOST
JAVERT EXPLORED THESE
GARDENS AND THESE WASTE STRETCHES AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN HUNTING FOR A
NEEDLE
AT DAYBREAK HE LEFT TWO INTELLIGENT MEN ON THE OUTLOOK AND RETURNED TO
THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE AS MUCH ASHAMED AS A POLICE SPY WHO HAD BEEN
CAPTURED BY A ROBBER MIGHT HAVE BEEN
BOOK SIXTH LE PETIT PICPUS
CHAPTER I NUMBER 62 RUE PETIT PICPUS
NOTHING HALF A CENTURY AGO MORE RESEMBLED EVERY OTHER CARRIAGE GATE
THAN THE CARRIAGE GATE OF NUMBER 62 RUE PETIT PICPUS
THIS ENTRANCE
WHICH USUALLY STOOD AJAR IN THE MOST INVITING FASHION PERMITTED A
VIEW OF TWO THINGS NEITHER OF WHICH HAVE ANYTHING VERY FUNEREAL ABOUT
THEM A COURTYARD SURROUNDED BY WALLS HUNG WITH VINES AND THE FACE
OF A LOUNGING PORTER
ABOVE THE WALL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE COURT TALL
TREES WERE VISIBLE
WHEN A RAY OF SUNLIGHT ENLIVENED THE COURTYARD WHEN
A GLASS OF WINE CHEERED UP THE PORTER IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PASS NUMBER
62 LITTLE PICPUS STREET WITHOUT CARRYING AWAY A SMILING IMPRESSION OF
IT
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS A SOMBRE PLACE OF WHICH ONE HAD HAD A GLIMPSE
THE THRESHOLD SMILED THE HOUSE PRAYED AND WEPT
IF ONE SUCCEEDED IN PASSING THE PORTER WHICH WAS NOT EASY WHICH WAS
EVEN NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR EVERY ONE FOR THERE WAS AN OPEN SESAME
WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO KNOW IF THE PORTER ONCE PASSED ONE ENTERED
A LITTLE VESTIBULE ON THE RIGHT ON WHICH OPENED A STAIRCASE SHUT IN
BETWEEN TWO WALLS AND SO NARROW THAT ONLY ONE PERSON COULD ASCEND IT AT
A TIME IF ONE DID NOT ALLOW ONE'S SELF TO BE ALARMED BY A DAUBING OF
CANARY YELLOW WITH A DADO OF CHOCOLATE WHICH CLOTHED THIS STAIRCASE IF
ONE VENTURED TO ASCEND IT ONE CROSSED A FIRST LANDING THEN A SECOND
AND ARRIVED ON THE FIRST STORY AT A CORRIDOR WHERE THE YELLOW WASH AND
THE CHOCOLATE HUED PLINTH PURSUED ONE WITH A PEACEABLE PERSISTENCY
STAIRCASE AND CORRIDOR WERE LIGHTED BY TWO BEAUTIFUL WINDOWS
THE
CORRIDOR TOOK A TURN AND BECAME DARK
IF ONE DOUBLED THIS CAPE ONE
ARRIVED A FEW PACES FURTHER ON IN FRONT OF A DOOR WHICH WAS ALL THE
MORE MYSTERIOUS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT FASTENED
IF ONE OPENED IT ONE
FOUND ONE'S SELF IN A LITTLE CHAMBER ABOUT SIX FEET SQUARE TILED
WELL SCRUBBED CLEAN COLD AND HUNG WITH NANKIN PAPER WITH GREEN
FLOWERS AT FIFTEEN SOUS THE ROLL
A WHITE DULL LIGHT FELL FROM A LARGE
WINDOW WITH TINY PANES ON THE LEFT WHICH USURPED THE WHOLE WIDTH
OF THE ROOM
ONE GAZED ABOUT BUT SAW NO ONE ONE LISTENED ONE HEARD
NEITHER A FOOTSTEP NOR A HUMAN MURMUR
THE WALLS WERE BARE THE CHAMBER
WAS NOT FURNISHED THERE WAS NOT EVEN A CHAIR
ONE LOOKED AGAIN AND BEHELD ON THE WALL FACING THE DOOR A QUADRANGULAR
HOLE ABOUT A FOOT SQUARE WITH A GRATING OF INTERLACING IRON BARS
BLACK KNOTTED SOLID WHICH FORMED SQUARES I HAD ALMOST SAID
MESHES OF LESS THAN AN INCH AND A HALF IN DIAGONAL LENGTH
THE LITTLE
GREEN FLOWERS OF THE NANKIN PAPER RAN IN A CALM AND ORDERLY MANNER TO
THOSE IRON BARS WITHOUT BEING STARTLED OR THROWN INTO CONFUSION BY
THEIR FUNEREAL CONTACT
SUPPOSING THAT A LIVING BEING HAD BEEN SO
WONDERFULLY THIN AS TO ESSAY AN ENTRANCE OR AN EXIT THROUGH THE SQUARE
HOLE THIS GRATING WOULD HAVE PREVENTED IT
IT DID NOT ALLOW THE PASSAGE
OF THE BODY BUT IT DID ALLOW THE PASSAGE OF THE EYES THAT IS TO
SAY OF THE MIND
THIS SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED TO THEM FOR IT HAD BEEN
RE ENFORCED BY A SHEET OF TIN INSERTED IN THE WALL A LITTLE IN THE REAR
AND PIERCED WITH A THOUSAND HOLES MORE MICROSCOPIC THAN THE HOLES OF
A STRAINER
AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PLATE AN APERTURE HAD BEEN PIERCED
EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THE ORIFICE OF A LETTER BOX
A BIT OF TAPE ATTACHED
TO A BELL WIRE HUNG AT THE RIGHT OF THE GRATED OPENING
IF THE TAPE WAS PULLED A BELL RANG AND ONE HEARD A VOICE VERY NEAR AT
HAND WHICH MADE ONE START
WHO IS THERE THE VOICE DEMANDED
IT WAS A WOMAN'S VOICE A GENTLE VOICE SO GENTLE THAT IT WAS MOURNFUL
HERE AGAIN THERE WAS A MAGICAL WORD WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO KNOW
IF
ONE DID NOT KNOW IT THE VOICE CEASED THE WALL BECAME SILENT ONCE MORE
AS THOUGH THE TERRIFIED OBSCURITY OF THE SEPULCHRE HAD BEEN ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF IT
IF ONE KNEW THE PASSWORD THE VOICE RESUMED ENTER ON THE RIGHT
ONE THEN PERCEIVED ON THE RIGHT FACING THE WINDOW A GLASS DOOR
SURMOUNTED BY A FRAME GLAZED AND PAINTED GRAY
ON RAISING THE LATCH AND
CROSSING THE THRESHOLD ONE EXPERIENCED PRECISELY THE SAME IMPRESSION
AS WHEN ONE ENTERS AT THE THEATRE INTO A GRATED BAIGNOIRE BEFORE THE
GRATING IS LOWERED AND THE CHANDELIER IS LIGHTED
ONE WAS IN FACT IN
A SORT OF THEATRE BOX NARROW FURNISHED WITH TWO OLD CHAIRS AND A
MUCH FRAYED STRAW MATTING SPARELY ILLUMINATED BY THE VAGUE LIGHT FROM
THE GLASS DOOR A REGULAR BOX WITH ITS FRONT JUST OF A HEIGHT TO LEAN
UPON BEARING A TABLET OF BLACK WOOD
THIS BOX WAS GRATED ONLY
THE GRATING OF IT WAS NOT OF GILDED WOOD AS AT THE OPERA IT WAS A
MONSTROUS LATTICE OF IRON BARS HIDEOUSLY INTERLACED AND RIVETED TO THE
WALL BY ENORMOUS FASTENINGS WHICH RESEMBLED CLENCHED FISTS
THE FIRST MINUTES PASSED WHEN ONE'S EYES BEGAN TO GROW USED TO THIS
CELLAR LIKE HALF TWILIGHT ONE TRIED TO PASS THE GRATING BUT GOT NO
FURTHER THAN SIX INCHES BEYOND IT
THERE HE ENCOUNTERED A BARRIER OF
BLACK SHUTTERS RE ENFORCED AND FORTIFIED WITH TRANSVERSE BEAMS OF WOOD
PAINTED A GINGERBREAD YELLOW
THESE SHUTTERS WERE DIVIDED INTO LONG
NARROW SLATS AND THEY MASKED THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE GRATING
THEY
WERE ALWAYS CLOSED
AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MOMENTS ONE HEARD A VOICE
PROCEEDING FROM BEHIND THESE SHUTTERS AND SAYING
I AM HERE
WHAT DO YOU WISH WITH ME
IT WAS A BELOVED SOMETIMES AN ADORED VOICE
NO ONE WAS VISIBLE
HARDLY
THE SOUND OF A BREATH WAS AUDIBLE
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH IT WERE A SPIRIT
WHICH HAD BEEN EVOKED THAT WAS SPEAKING TO YOU ACROSS THE WALLS OF THE
TOMB
IF ONE CHANCED TO BE WITHIN CERTAIN PRESCRIBED AND VERY RARE CONDITIONS
THE SLAT OF ONE OF THE SHUTTERS OPENED OPPOSITE YOU THE EVOKED SPIRIT
BECAME AN APPARITION
BEHIND THE GRATING BEHIND THE SHUTTER ONE
PERCEIVED SO FAR AS THE GRATING PERMITTED SIGHT A HEAD OF WHICH ONLY
THE MOUTH AND THE CHIN WERE VISIBLE THE REST WAS COVERED WITH A BLACK
VEIL
ONE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A BLACK GUIMPE AND A FORM THAT WAS BARELY
DEFINED COVERED WITH A BLACK SHROUD
THAT HEAD SPOKE WITH YOU BUT DID
NOT LOOK AT YOU AND NEVER SMILED AT YOU
THE LIGHT WHICH CAME FROM BEHIND YOU WAS ADJUSTED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT
YOU SAW HER IN THE WHITE AND SHE SAW YOU IN THE BLACK
THIS LIGHT WAS
SYMBOLICAL
NEVERTHELESS YOUR EYES PLUNGED EAGERLY THROUGH THAT OPENING WHICH
WAS MADE IN THAT PLACE SHUT OFF FROM ALL GLANCES
A PROFOUND VAGUENESS
ENVELOPED THAT FORM CLAD IN MOURNING
YOUR EYES SEARCHED THAT VAGUENESS
AND SOUGHT TO MAKE OUT THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE APPARITION
AT THE
EXPIRATION OF A VERY SHORT TIME YOU DISCOVERED THAT YOU COULD SEE
NOTHING
WHAT YOU BEHELD WAS NIGHT EMPTINESS SHADOWS A WINTRY MIST
MINGLED WITH A VAPOR FROM THE TOMB A SORT OF TERRIBLE PEACE A SILENCE
FROM WHICH YOU COULD GATHER NOTHING NOT EVEN SIGHS A GLOOM IN WHICH
YOU COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING NOT EVEN PHANTOMS
WHAT YOU BEHELD WAS THE INTERIOR OF A CLOISTER
IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF THAT SEVERE AND GLOOMY EDIFICE WHICH WAS CALLED
THE CONVENT OF THE BERNARDINES OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION
THE BOX IN
WHICH YOU STOOD WAS THE PARLOR
THE FIRST VOICE WHICH HAD ADDRESSED YOU
WAS THAT OF THE PORTRESS WHO ALWAYS SAT MOTIONLESS AND SILENT ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL NEAR THE SQUARE OPENING SCREENED BY THE IRON
GRATING AND THE PLATE WITH ITS THOUSAND HOLES AS BY A DOUBLE VISOR
THE OBSCURITY WHICH BATHED THE GRATED BOX AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT THE
PARLOR WHICH HAD A WINDOW ON THE SIDE OF THE WORLD HAD NONE ON THE
SIDE OF THE CONVENT
PROFANE EYES MUST SEE NOTHING OF THAT SACRED PLACE
NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS SOMETHING BEYOND THAT SHADOW THERE WAS A LIGHT
THERE WAS LIFE IN THE MIDST OF THAT DEATH
ALTHOUGH THIS WAS THE MOST
STRICTLY WALLED OF ALL CONVENTS WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO MAKE OUR WAY INTO
IT AND TO TAKE THE READER IN AND TO SAY WITHOUT TRANSGRESSING THE
PROPER BOUNDS THINGS WHICH STORY TELLERS HAVE NEVER SEEN AND HAVE
THEREFORE NEVER DESCRIBED
CHAPTER II THE OBEDIENCE OF MARTIN VERGA
THIS CONVENT WHICH IN 1824 HAD ALREADY EXISTED FOR MANY A LONG YEAR IN
THE RUE PETIT PICPUS WAS A COMMUNITY OF BERNARDINES OF THE OBEDIENCE OF
MARTIN VERGA
THESE BERNARDINES WERE ATTACHED IN CONSEQUENCE NOT TO CLAIRVAUX LIKE
THE BERNARDINE MONKS BUT TO CITEAUX LIKE THE BENEDICTINE MONKS
IN
OTHER WORDS THEY WERE THE SUBJECTS NOT OF SAINT BERNARD BUT OF SAINT
BENOIT
ANY ONE WHO HAS TURNED OVER OLD FOLIOS TO ANY EXTENT KNOWS THAT MARTIN
VERGA FOUNDED IN 1425 A CONGREGATION OF BERNARDINES BENEDICTINES
WITH SALAMANCA FOR THE HEAD OF THE ORDER AND ALCALA AS THE BRANCH
ESTABLISHMENT
THIS CONGREGATION HAD SENT OUT BRANCHES THROUGHOUT ALL THE CATHOLIC
COUNTRIES OF EUROPE
THERE IS NOTHING UNUSUAL IN THE LATIN CHURCH IN THESE GRAFTS OF ONE
ORDER ON ANOTHER
TO MENTION ONLY A SINGLE ORDER OF SAINT BENOIT WHICH
IS HERE IN QUESTION THERE ARE ATTACHED TO THIS ORDER WITHOUT COUNTING
THE OBEDIENCE OF MARTIN VERGA FOUR CONGREGATIONS TWO IN ITALY
MONT CASSIN AND SAINTE JUSTINE OF PADUA TWO IN FRANCE CLUNY AND
SAINT MAUR AND NINE ORDERS VALLOMBROSA GRANMONT THE CELESTINS
THE CAMALDULES THE CARTHUSIANS THE HUMILIES THE OLIVATEURS THE
SILVESTRINS AND LASTLY CITEAUX FOR CITEAUX ITSELF A TRUNK FOR OTHER
ORDERS IS ONLY AN OFFSHOOT OF SAINT BENOIT
CITEAUX DATES FROM SAINT
ROBERT ABBE DE MOLESME IN THE DIOCESE OF LANGRES IN 1098
NOW IT WAS
IN 529 THAT THE DEVIL HAVING RETIRED TO THE DESERT OF SUBIACO HE
WAS OLD HAD HE TURNED HERMIT WAS CHASED FROM THE ANCIENT TEMPLE OF
APOLLO WHERE HE DWELT BY SAINT BENOIT THEN AGED SEVENTEEN
AFTER THE RULE OF THE CARMELITES WHO GO BAREFOOT WEAR A BIT OF WILLOW
ON THEIR THROATS AND NEVER SIT DOWN THE HARSHEST RULE IS THAT OF THE
BERNARDINES BENEDICTINES OF MARTIN VERGA
THEY ARE CLOTHED IN BLACK
WITH A GUIMPE WHICH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS COMMAND OF
SAINT BENOIT MOUNTS TO THE CHIN
A ROBE OF SERGE WITH LARGE SLEEVES
A LARGE WOOLLEN VEIL THE GUIMPE WHICH MOUNTS TO THE CHIN CUT SQUARE ON
THE BREAST THE BAND WHICH DESCENDS OVER THEIR BROW TO THEIR EYES THIS
IS THEIR DRESS
ALL IS BLACK EXCEPT THE BAND WHICH IS WHITE
THE
NOVICES WEAR THE SAME HABIT BUT ALL IN WHITE
THE PROFESSED NUNS ALSO
WEAR A ROSARY AT THEIR SIDE
THE BERNARDINES BENEDICTINES OF MARTIN VERGA PRACTISE THE PERPETUAL
ADORATION LIKE THE BENEDICTINES CALLED LADIES OF THE HOLY SACRAMENT
WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY HAD TWO HOUSES IN PARIS ONE AT
THE TEMPLE THE OTHER IN THE RUE NEUVE SAINTE GENEVIEVE
HOWEVER THE
BERNARDINES BENEDICTINES OF THE PETIT PICPUS OF WHOM WE ARE SPEAKING
WERE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ORDER FROM THE LADIES OF THE HOLY SACRAMENT
CLOISTERED IN THE RUE NEUVE SAINTE GENEVIEVE AND AT THE TEMPLE
THERE
WERE NUMEROUS DIFFERENCES IN THEIR RULE THERE WERE SOME IN THEIR
COSTUME
THE BERNARDINES BENEDICTINES OF THE PETIT PICPUS WORE THE
BLACK GUIMPE AND THE BENEDICTINES OF THE HOLY SACRAMENT AND OF THE
RUE NEUVE SAINTE GENEVIEVE WORE A WHITE ONE AND HAD BESIDES ON THEIR
BREASTS A HOLY SACRAMENT ABOUT THREE INCHES LONG IN SILVER GILT OR
GILDED COPPER
THE NUNS OF THE PETIT PICPUS DID NOT WEAR THIS HOLY
SACRAMENT
THE PERPETUAL ADORATION WHICH WAS COMMON TO THE HOUSE OF
THE PETIT PICPUS AND TO THE HOUSE OF THE TEMPLE LEAVES THOSE TWO ORDERS
PERFECTLY DISTINCT
THEIR ONLY RESEMBLANCE LIES IN THIS PRACTICE OF THE
LADIES OF THE HOLY SACRAMENT AND THE BERNARDINES OF MARTIN VERGA JUST
AS THERE EXISTED A SIMILARITY IN THE STUDY AND THE GLORIFICATION OF
ALL THE MYSTERIES RELATING TO THE INFANCY THE LIFE AND DEATH OF JESUS
CHRIST AND THE VIRGIN BETWEEN THE TWO ORDERS WHICH WERE NEVERTHELESS
WIDELY SEPARATED AND ON OCCASION EVEN HOSTILE
THE ORATORY OF ITALY
ESTABLISHED AT FLORENCE BY PHILIP DE NERI AND THE ORATORY OF FRANCE
ESTABLISHED BY PIERRE DE BERULLE
THE ORATORY OF FRANCE CLAIMED THE
PRECEDENCE SINCE PHILIP DE NERI WAS ONLY A SAINT WHILE BERULLE WAS A
CARDINAL
LET US RETURN TO THE HARSH SPANISH RULE OF MARTIN VERGA
THE BERNARDINES BENEDICTINES OF THIS OBEDIENCE FAST ALL THE YEAR
ROUND ABSTAIN FROM MEAT FAST IN LENT AND ON MANY OTHER DAYS WHICH ARE
PECULIAR TO THEM RISE FROM THEIR FIRST SLEEP FROM ONE TO THREE O'CLOCK
IN THE MORNING TO READ THEIR BREVIARY AND CHANT MATINS SLEEP IN ALL
SEASONS BETWEEN SERGE SHEETS AND ON STRAW MAKE NO USE OF THE BATH
NEVER LIGHT A FIRE SCOURGE THEMSELVES EVERY FRIDAY OBSERVE THE RULE OF
SILENCE SPEAK TO EACH OTHER ONLY DURING THE RECREATION HOURS WHICH ARE
VERY BRIEF AND WEAR DRUGGET CHEMISES FOR SIX MONTHS IN THE YEAR FROM
SEPTEMBER 14TH WHICH IS THE EXALTATION OF THE HOLY CROSS UNTIL EASTER
THESE SIX MONTHS ARE A MODIFICATION THE RULE SAYS ALL THE YEAR BUT
THIS DRUGGET CHEMISE INTOLERABLE IN THE HEAT OF SUMMER PRODUCED FEVERS
AND NERVOUS SPASMS
THE USE OF IT HAD TO BE RESTRICTED
EVEN WITH THIS
PALLIATION WHEN THE NUNS PUT ON THIS CHEMISE ON THE 14TH OF SEPTEMBER
THEY SUFFER FROM FEVER FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS
OBEDIENCE POVERTY
CHASTITY PERSEVERANCE IN THEIR SECLUSION THESE ARE THEIR VOWS WHICH
THE RULE GREATLY AGGRAVATES
THE PRIORESS IS ELECTED FOR THREE YEARS BY THE MOTHERS WHO ARE CALLED
MERES VOCALES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A VOICE IN THE CHAPTER
A PRIORESS CAN
ONLY BE RE ELECTED TWICE WHICH FIXES THE LONGEST POSSIBLE REIGN OF A
PRIORESS AT NINE YEARS
THEY NEVER SEE THE OFFICIATING PRIEST WHO IS ALWAYS HIDDEN FROM THEM
BY A SERGE CURTAIN NINE FEET IN HEIGHT
DURING THE SERMON WHEN THE
PREACHER IS IN THE CHAPEL THEY DROP THEIR VEILS OVER THEIR FACES
THEY
MUST ALWAYS SPEAK LOW WALK WITH THEIR EYES ON THE GROUND AND THEIR
HEADS BOWED
ONE MAN ONLY IS ALLOWED TO ENTER THE CONVENT THE
ARCHBISHOP OF THE DIOCESE
THERE IS REALLY ONE OTHER THE GARDENER
BUT HE IS ALWAYS AN OLD MAN
AND IN ORDER THAT HE MAY ALWAYS BE ALONE IN THE GARDEN AND THAT THE
NUNS MAY BE WARNED TO AVOID HIM A BELL IS ATTACHED TO HIS KNEE
THEIR SUBMISSION TO THE PRIORESS IS ABSOLUTE AND PASSIVE
IT IS THE
CANONICAL SUBJECTION IN THE FULL FORCE OF ITS ABNEGATION
AS AT THE
VOICE OF CHRIST UT VOCI CHRISTI AT A GESTURE AT THE FIRST SIGN
AD NUTUM AD PRIMUM SIGNUM IMMEDIATELY WITH CHEERFULNESS WITH
PERSEVERANCE WITH A CERTAIN BLIND OBEDIENCE PROMPTE HILARITER
PERSEVERANTER ET CAECA QUADAM OBEDIENTIA AS THE FILE IN THE HAND OF THE
WORKMAN QUASI LIMAM IN MANIBUS FABRI WITHOUT POWER TO READ OR TO WRITE
WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION LEGERE VEL SCRIBERE NON ADDISCERIT SINE
EXPRESSA SUPERIORIS LICENTIA
EACH ONE OF THEM IN TURN MAKES WHAT THEY CALL REPARATION
THE REPARATION
IS THE PRAYER FOR ALL THE SINS FOR ALL THE FAULTS FOR ALL THE
DISSENSIONS FOR ALL THE VIOLATIONS FOR ALL THE INIQUITIES FOR ALL THE
CRIMES COMMITTED ON EARTH
FOR THE SPACE OF TWELVE CONSECUTIVE HOURS
FROM FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON TILL FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING OR
FROM FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING UNTIL FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
THE SISTER WHO IS MAKING REPARATION REMAINS ON HER KNEES ON THE STONE
BEFORE THE HOLY SACRAMENT WITH HANDS CLASPED A ROPE AROUND HER NECK
WHEN HER FATIGUE BECOMES UNENDURABLE SHE PROSTRATES HERSELF FLAT ON
HER FACE AGAINST THE EARTH WITH HER ARMS OUTSTRETCHED IN THE FORM OF A
CROSS THIS IS HER ONLY RELIEF
IN THIS ATTITUDE SHE PRAYS FOR ALL THE
GUILTY IN THE UNIVERSE
THIS IS GREAT TO SUBLIMITY
AS THIS ACT IS PERFORMED IN FRONT OF A POST ON WHICH BURNS A CANDLE IT
IS CALLED WITHOUT DISTINCTION TO MAKE REPARATION OR TO BE AT THE POST
THE NUNS EVEN PREFER OUT OF HUMILITY THIS LAST EXPRESSION WHICH
CONTAINS AN IDEA OF TORTURE AND ABASEMENT
TO MAKE REPARATION IS A FUNCTION IN WHICH THE WHOLE SOUL IS ABSORBED
THE SISTER AT THE POST WOULD NOT TURN ROUND WERE A THUNDERBOLT TO FALL
DIRECTLY BEHIND HER
BESIDES THIS THERE IS ALWAYS A SISTER KNEELING BEFORE THE HOLY
SACRAMENT
THIS STATION LASTS AN HOUR
THEY RELIEVE EACH OTHER LIKE
SOLDIERS ON GUARD
THIS IS THE PERPETUAL ADORATION
THE PRIORESSES AND THE MOTHERS ALMOST ALWAYS BEAR NAMES STAMPED WITH
PECULIAR SOLEMNITY RECALLING NOT THE SAINTS AND MARTYRS BUT MOMENTS
IN THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST AS MOTHER NATIVITY MOTHER CONCEPTION
MOTHER PRESENTATION MOTHER PASSION
BUT THE NAMES OF SAINTS ARE NOT
INTERDICTED
WHEN ONE SEES THEM ONE NEVER SEES ANYTHING BUT THEIR MOUTHS
ALL THEIR TEETH ARE YELLOW
NO TOOTH BRUSH EVER ENTERED THAT CONVENT
BRUSHING ONE'S TEETH IS AT THE TOP OF A LADDER AT WHOSE BOTTOM IS THE
LOSS OF ONE'S SOUL
THEY NEVER SAY MY
THEY POSSESS NOTHING OF THEIR OWN AND THEY MUST NOT
ATTACH THEMSELVES TO ANYTHING
THEY CALL EVERYTHING OUR THUS OUR VEIL
OUR CHAPLET IF THEY WERE SPEAKING OF THEIR CHEMISE THEY WOULD SAY OUR
CHEMISE
SOMETIMES THEY GROW ATTACHED TO SOME PETTY OBJECT TO A BOOK
OF HOURS A RELIC A MEDAL THAT HAS BEEN BLESSED
AS SOON AS THEY BECOME
AWARE THAT THEY ARE GROWING ATTACHED TO THIS OBJECT THEY MUST GIVE IT
UP
THEY RECALL THE WORDS OF SAINT THERESE TO WHOM A GREAT LADY SAID
AS SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF ENTERING HER ORDER PERMIT ME MOTHER TO
SEND FOR A BIBLE TO WHICH I AM GREATLY ATTACHED AH YOU ARE ATTACHED
TO SOMETHING IN THAT CASE DO NOT ENTER OUR ORDER
EVERY PERSON WHATEVER IS FORBIDDEN TO SHUT HERSELF UP TO HAVE A PLACE
OF HER OWN A CHAMBER
THEY LIVE WITH THEIR CELLS OPEN
WHEN THEY MEET
ONE SAYS BLESSED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR
THE OTHER RESPONDS FOREVER THE SAME CEREMONY WHEN ONE TAPS AT THE
OTHER'S DOOR
HARDLY HAS SHE TOUCHED THE DOOR WHEN A SOFT VOICE ON THE
OTHER SIDE IS HEARD TO SAY HASTILY FOREVER LIKE ALL PRACTICES THIS
BECOMES MECHANICAL BY FORCE OF HABIT AND ONE SOMETIMES SAYS FOREVER
BEFORE THE OTHER HAS HAD TIME TO SAY THE RATHER LONG SENTENCE PRAISED
AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR
AMONG THE VISITANDINES THE ONE WHO ENTERS SAYS AVE MARIA AND THE ONE
WHOSE CELL IS ENTERED SAYS GRATIA PLENA IT IS THEIR WAY OF SAYING
GOOD DAY WHICH IS IN FACT FULL OF GRACE
AT EACH HOUR OF THE DAY THREE SUPPLEMENTARY STROKES SOUND FROM THE
CHURCH BELL OF THE CONVENT
AT THIS SIGNAL PRIORESS VOCAL MOTHERS
PROFESSED NUNS LAY SISTERS NOVICES POSTULANTS INTERRUPT WHAT THEY
ARE SAYING WHAT THEY ARE DOING OR WHAT THEY ARE THINKING AND ALL SAY
IN UNISON IF IT IS FIVE O'CLOCK FOR INSTANCE AT FIVE O'CLOCK AND AT
ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR
IF IT IS EIGHT O'CLOCK AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND AT ALL HOURS AND SO ON
ACCORDING TO THE HOUR
THIS CUSTOM THE OBJECT OF WHICH IS TO BREAK THE THREAD OF THOUGHT
AND TO LEAD IT BACK CONSTANTLY TO GOD EXISTS IN MANY COMMUNITIES THE
FORMULA ALONE VARIES
THUS AT THE INFANT JESUS THEY SAY AT THIS
HOUR AND AT EVERY HOUR MAY THE LOVE OF JESUS KINDLE MY HEART THE
BERNARDINES BENEDICTINES OF MARTIN VERGA CLOISTERED FIFTY YEARS AGO AT
PETIT PICPUS CHANT THE OFFICES TO A SOLEMN PSALMODY A PURE GREGORIAN
CHANT AND ALWAYS WITH FULL VOICE DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE OFFICE
EVERYWHERE IN THE MISSAL WHERE AN ASTERISK OCCURS THEY PAUSE AND SAY IN
A LOW VOICE JESUS MARIE JOSEPH FOR THE OFFICE OF THE DEAD THEY ADOPT
A TONE SO LOW THAT THE VOICES OF WOMEN CAN HARDLY DESCEND TO SUCH A
DEPTH
THE EFFECT PRODUCED IS STRIKING AND TRAGIC
THE NUNS OF THE PETIT PICPUS HAD MADE A VAULT UNDER THEIR GRAND ALTAR
FOR THE BURIAL OF THEIR COMMUNITY
THE GOVERNMENT AS THEY SAY DOES NOT
PERMIT THIS VAULT TO RECEIVE COFFINS SO THEY LEAVE THE CONVENT WHEN THEY
DIE
THIS IS AN AFFLICTION TO THEM AND CAUSES THEM CONSTERNATION AS AN
INFRACTION OF THE RULES
THEY HAD OBTAINED A MEDIOCRE CONSOLATION AT BEST PERMISSION TO BE
INTERRED AT A SPECIAL HOUR AND IN A SPECIAL CORNER IN THE ANCIENT
VAUGIRARD CEMETERY WHICH WAS MADE OF LAND WHICH HAD FORMERLY BELONGED
TO THEIR COMMUNITY
ON FRIDAYS THE NUNS HEAR HIGH MASS VESPERS AND ALL THE OFFICES AS ON
SUNDAY
THEY SCRUPULOUSLY OBSERVE IN ADDITION ALL THE LITTLE FESTIVALS
UNKNOWN TO PEOPLE OF THE WORLD OF WHICH THE CHURCH OF FRANCE WAS SO
PRODIGAL IN THE OLDEN DAYS AND OF WHICH IT IS STILL PRODIGAL IN SPAIN
AND ITALY
THEIR STATIONS IN THE CHAPEL ARE INTERMINABLE
AS FOR THE
NUMBER AND DURATION OF THEIR PRAYERS WE CAN CONVEY NO BETTER IDEA OF
THEM THAN BY QUOTING THE INGENUOUS REMARK OF ONE OF THEM THE PRAYERS
OF THE POSTULANTS ARE FRIGHTFUL THE PRAYERS OF THE NOVICES ARE STILL
WORSE AND THE PRAYERS OF THE PROFESSED NUNS ARE STILL WORSE
ONCE A WEEK THE CHAPTER ASSEMBLES THE PRIORESS PRESIDES THE VOCAL
MOTHERS ASSIST
EACH SISTER KNEELS IN TURN ON THE STONES AND CONFESSES
ALOUD IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE FAULTS AND SINS WHICH SHE HAS
COMMITTED DURING THE WEEK
THE VOCAL MOTHERS CONSULT AFTER EACH
CONFESSION AND INFLICT THE PENANCE ALOUD
BESIDES THIS CONFESSION IN A LOUD TONE FOR WHICH ALL FAULTS IN THE
LEAST SERIOUS ARE RESERVED THEY HAVE FOR THEIR VENIAL OFFENCES WHAT
THEY CALL THE COULPE
TO MAKE ONE'S COULPE MEANS TO PROSTRATE ONE'S SELF
FLAT ON ONE'S FACE DURING THE OFFICE IN FRONT OF THE PRIORESS UNTIL
THE LATTER WHO IS NEVER CALLED ANYTHING BUT OUR MOTHER NOTIFIES THE
CULPRIT BY A SLIGHT TAP OF HER FOOT AGAINST THE WOOD OF HER STALL THAT
SHE CAN RISE
THE COULPE OR PECCAVI IS MADE FOR A VERY SMALL MATTER A
BROKEN GLASS A TORN VEIL AN INVOLUNTARY DELAY OF A FEW SECONDS AT AN
OFFICE A FALSE NOTE IN CHURCH ETC THIS SUFFICES AND THE COULPE
IS MADE
THE COULPE IS ENTIRELY SPONTANEOUS IT IS THE CULPABLE PERSON
HERSELF THE WORD IS ETYMOLOGICALLY IN ITS PLACE HERE WHO JUDGES
HERSELF AND INFLICTS IT ON HERSELF
ON FESTIVAL DAYS AND SUNDAYS FOUR
MOTHER PRECENTORS INTONE THE OFFICES BEFORE A LARGE READING DESK WITH
FOUR PLACES
ONE DAY ONE OF THE MOTHER PRECENTORS INTONED A PSALM
BEGINNING WITH ECCE AND INSTEAD OF ECCE SHE UTTERED ALOUD THE THREE
NOTES DO SI SOL FOR THIS PIECE OF ABSENT MINDEDNESS SHE UNDERWENT A
COULPE WHICH LASTED DURING THE WHOLE SERVICE WHAT RENDERED THE FAULT
ENORMOUS WAS THE FACT THAT THE CHAPTER HAD LAUGHED
WHEN A NUN IS SUMMONED TO THE PARLOR EVEN WERE IT THE PRIORESS HERSELF
SHE DROPS HER VEIL AS WILL BE REMEMBERED SO THAT ONLY HER MOUTH IS
VISIBLE
THE PRIORESS ALONE CAN HOLD COMMUNICATION WITH STRANGERS
THE OTHERS CAN
SEE ONLY THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY AND THAT VERY RARELY
IF BY CHANCE
AN OUTSIDER PRESENTS HERSELF TO SEE A NUN OR ONE WHOM SHE HAS KNOWN AND
LOVED IN THE OUTER WORLD A REGULAR SERIES OF NEGOTIATIONS IS REQUIRED
IF IT IS A WOMAN THE AUTHORIZATION MAY SOMETIMES BE GRANTED THE NUN
COMES AND THEY TALK TO HER THROUGH THE SHUTTERS WHICH ARE OPENED ONLY
FOR A MOTHER OR SISTER
IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT PERMISSION IS
ALWAYS REFUSED TO MEN
SUCH IS THE RULE OF SAINT BENOIT AGGRAVATED BY MARTIN VERGA
THESE NUNS ARE NOT GAY ROSY AND FRESH AS THE DAUGHTERS OF OTHER
ORDERS OFTEN ARE
THEY ARE PALE AND GRAVE
BETWEEN 1825 AND 1830 THREE
OF THEM WENT MAD
CHAPTER III AUSTERITIES
ONE IS A POSTULANT FOR TWO YEARS AT LEAST OFTEN FOR FOUR A NOVICE FOR
FOUR
IT IS RARE THAT THE DEFINITIVE VOWS CAN BE PRONOUNCED
EARLIER THAN THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY FOUR YEARS
THE
BERNARDINES BENEDICTINES OF MARTIN VERGA DO NOT ADMIT WIDOWS TO THEIR
ORDER
IN THEIR CELLS THEY DELIVER THEMSELVES UP TO MANY UNKNOWN MACERATIONS
OF WHICH THEY MUST NEVER SPEAK
ON THE DAY WHEN A NOVICE MAKES HER PROFESSION SHE IS DRESSED IN HER
HANDSOMEST ATTIRE SHE IS CROWNED WITH WHITE ROSES HER HAIR IS BRUSHED
UNTIL IT SHINES AND CURLED
THEN SHE PROSTRATES HERSELF A GREAT BLACK
VEIL IS THROWN OVER HER AND THE OFFICE FOR THE DEAD IS SUNG
THEN THE
NUNS SEPARATE INTO TWO FILES ONE FILE PASSES CLOSE TO HER SAYING IN
PLAINTIVE ACCENTS OUR SISTER IS DEAD AND THE OTHER FILE RESPONDS IN
A VOICE OF ECSTASY OUR SISTER IS ALIVE IN JESUS CHRIST
AT THE EPOCH WHEN THIS STORY TAKES PLACE A BOARDING SCHOOL WAS ATTACHED
TO THE CONVENT A BOARDING SCHOOL FOR YOUNG GIRLS OF NOBLE AND
MOSTLY WEALTHY FAMILIES AMONG WHOM COULD BE REMARKED MADEMOISELLE
DE SAINT AULAIRE AND DE BELISSEN AND AN ENGLISH GIRL BEARING THE
ILLUSTRIOUS CATHOLIC NAME OF TALBOT
THESE YOUNG GIRLS REARED BY THESE
NUNS BETWEEN FOUR WALLS GREW UP WITH A HORROR OF THE WORLD AND OF THE
AGE
ONE OF THEM SAID TO US ONE DAY THE SIGHT OF THE STREET PAVEMENT
MADE ME SHUDDER FROM HEAD TO FOOT THEY WERE DRESSED IN BLUE WITH A
WHITE CAP AND A HOLY SPIRIT OF SILVER GILT OR OF COPPER ON THEIR BREAST
ON CERTAIN GRAND FESTIVAL DAYS PARTICULARLY SAINT MARTHA'S DAY THEY
WERE PERMITTED AS A HIGH FAVOR AND A SUPREME HAPPINESS TO DRESS
THEMSELVES AS NUNS AND TO CARRY OUT THE OFFICES AND PRACTICE OF
SAINT BENOIT FOR A WHOLE DAY
IN THE EARLY DAYS THE NUNS WERE IN THE
HABIT OF LENDING THEM THEIR BLACK GARMENTS
THIS SEEMED PROFANE AND
THE PRIORESS FORBADE IT
ONLY THE NOVICES WERE PERMITTED TO LEND
IT IS
REMARKABLE THAT THESE PERFORMANCES TOLERATED AND ENCOURAGED NO DOUBT
IN THE CONVENT OUT OF A SECRET SPIRIT OF PROSELYTISM AND IN ORDER
TO GIVE THESE CHILDREN A FORETASTE OF THE HOLY HABIT WERE A GENUINE
HAPPINESS AND A REAL RECREATION FOR THE SCHOLARS
THEY SIMPLY AMUSED
THEMSELVES WITH IT
IT WAS NEW IT GAVE THEM A CHANGE
CANDID REASONS
OF CHILDHOOD WHICH DO NOT HOWEVER SUCCEED IN MAKING US WORLDLINGS
COMPREHEND THE FELICITY OF HOLDING A HOLY WATER SPRINKLER IN ONE'S HAND
AND STANDING FOR HOURS TOGETHER SINGING HARD ENOUGH FOR FOUR IN FRONT OF
A READING DESK
THE PUPILS CONFORMED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE AUSTERITIES TO ALL THE
PRACTICES OF THE CONVENT
THERE WAS A CERTAIN YOUNG WOMAN WHO ENTERED
THE WORLD AND WHO AFTER MANY YEARS OF MARRIED LIFE HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN
BREAKING HERSELF OF THE HABIT OF SAYING IN GREAT HASTE WHENEVER ANY
ONE KNOCKED AT HER DOOR FOREVER LIKE THE NUNS THE PUPILS SAW
THEIR RELATIVES ONLY IN THE PARLOR
THEIR VERY MOTHERS DID NOT OBTAIN
PERMISSION TO EMBRACE THEM
THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATES TO WHAT A DEGREE
SEVERITY ON THAT POINT WAS CARRIED
ONE DAY A YOUNG GIRL RECEIVED A
VISIT FROM HER MOTHER WHO WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A LITTLE SISTER THREE
YEARS OF AGE
THE YOUNG GIRL WEPT FOR SHE WISHED GREATLY TO EMBRACE
HER SISTER
IMPOSSIBLE
SHE BEGGED THAT AT LEAST THE CHILD MIGHT BE
PERMITTED TO PASS HER LITTLE HAND THROUGH THE BARS SO THAT SHE COULD
KISS IT
THIS WAS ALMOST INDIGNANTLY REFUSED
CHAPTER IV GAYETIES
NONE THE LESS THESE YOUNG GIRLS FILLED THIS GRAVE HOUSE WITH CHARMING
SOUVENIRS
AT CERTAIN HOURS CHILDHOOD SPARKLED IN THAT CLOISTER
THE RECREATION
HOUR STRUCK
A DOOR SWUNG ON ITS HINGES
THE BIRDS SAID GOOD
HERE COME THE CHILDREN AN IRRUPTION OF YOUTH INUNDATED THAT GARDEN
INTERSECTED WITH A CROSS LIKE A SHROUD
RADIANT FACES WHITE FOREHEADS
INNOCENT EYES FULL OF MERRY LIGHT ALL SORTS OF AURORAS WERE SCATTERED
ABOUT AMID THESE SHADOWS
AFTER THE PSALMODIES THE BELLS THE PEALS
AND KNELLS AND OFFICES THE SOUND OF THESE LITTLE GIRLS BURST FORTH ON A
SUDDEN MORE SWEETLY THAN THE NOISE OF BEES
THE HIVE OF JOY WAS OPENED
AND EACH ONE BROUGHT HER HONEY
THEY PLAYED THEY CALLED TO EACH OTHER
THEY FORMED INTO GROUPS THEY RAN ABOUT PRETTY LITTLE WHITE TEETH
CHATTERED IN THE CORNERS THE VEILS SUPERINTENDED THE LAUGHS FROM A
DISTANCE SHADES KEPT WATCH OF THE SUNBEAMS BUT WHAT MATTERED IT STILL
THEY BEAMED AND LAUGHED
THOSE FOUR LUGUBRIOUS WALLS HAD THEIR MOMENT
OF DAZZLING BRILLIANCY
THEY LOOKED ON VAGUELY BLANCHED WITH THE
REFLECTION OF SO MUCH JOY AT THIS SWEET SWARMING OF THE HIVES
IT WAS
LIKE A SHOWER OF ROSES FALLING ATHWART THIS HOUSE OF MOURNING
THE YOUNG
GIRLS FROLICKED BENEATH THE EYES OF THE NUNS THE GAZE OF IMPECCABILITY
DOES NOT EMBARRASS INNOCENCE
THANKS TO THESE CHILDREN THERE WAS
AMONG SO MANY AUSTERE HOURS ONE HOUR OF INGENUOUSNESS
THE LITTLE ONES
SKIPPED ABOUT THE ELDER ONES DANCED
IN THIS CLOISTER PLAY WAS MINGLED
WITH HEAVEN
NOTHING IS SO DELIGHTFUL AND SO AUGUST AS ALL THESE FRESH
EXPANDING YOUNG SOULS
HOMER WOULD HAVE COME THITHER TO LAUGH WITH
PERRAULT AND THERE WAS IN THAT BLACK GARDEN YOUTH HEALTH NOISE
CRIES GIDDINESS PLEASURE HAPPINESS ENOUGH TO SMOOTH OUT THE WRINKLES
OF ALL THEIR ANCESTRESSES THOSE OF THE EPIC AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE
FAIRY TALE THOSE OF THE THRONE AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE THATCHED COTTAGE
FROM HECUBA TO LA MERE GRAND
IN THAT HOUSE MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE PERHAPS ARISE THOSE CHILDREN'S
SAYINGS WHICH ARE SO GRACEFUL AND WHICH EVOKE A SMILE THAT IS FULL OF
THOUGHTFULNESS
IT WAS BETWEEN THOSE FOUR GLOOMY WALLS THAT A CHILD OF
FIVE YEARS EXCLAIMED ONE DAY MOTHER ONE OF THE BIG GIRLS HAS JUST
TOLD ME THAT I HAVE ONLY NINE YEARS AND TEN MONTHS LONGER TO REMAIN
HERE
WHAT HAPPINESS
IT WAS HERE TOO THAT THIS MEMORABLE DIALOGUE TOOK PLACE
A VOCAL MOTHER
WHY ARE YOU WEEPING MY CHILD
THE CHILD AGED SIX
I TOLD ALIX THAT I KNEW MY FRENCH HISTORY
SHE
SAYS THAT I DO NOT KNOW IT BUT I DO
ALIX THE BIG GIRL AGED NINE
NO SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT
THE MOTHER
HOW IS THAT MY CHILD
ALIX
SHE TOLD ME TO OPEN THE BOOK AT RANDOM AND TO ASK HER ANY QUESTION
IN THE BOOK AND SHE WOULD ANSWER IT
WELL
SHE DID NOT ANSWER IT
LET US SEE ABOUT IT
WHAT DID YOU ASK HER
I OPENED THE BOOK AT RANDOM AS SHE PROPOSED AND I PUT THE FIRST
QUESTION THAT I CAME ACROSS
AND WHAT WAS THE QUESTION
IT WAS 'WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT
IT WAS THERE THAT THAT PROFOUND REMARK WAS MADE ANENT A RATHER GREEDY
PAROQUET WHICH BELONGED TO A LADY BOARDER
HOW WELL BRED IT EATS THE TOP OF THE SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER JUST
LIKE A PERSON
IT WAS ON ONE OF THE FLAGSTONES OF THIS CLOISTER THAT THERE WAS ONCE
PICKED UP A CONFESSION WHICH HAD BEEN WRITTEN OUT IN ADVANCE IN ORDER
THAT SHE MIGHT NOT FORGET IT BY A SINNER OF SEVEN YEARS
FATHER I ACCUSE MYSELF OF HAVING BEEN AVARICIOUS
FATHER I ACCUSE MYSELF OF HAVING BEEN AN ADULTERESS
FATHER I ACCUSE MYSELF OF HAVING RAISED MY EYES TO THE GENTLEMEN
IT WAS ON ONE OF THE TURF BENCHES OF THIS GARDEN THAT A ROSY MOUTH SIX
YEARS OF AGE IMPROVISED THE FOLLOWING TALE WHICH WAS LISTENED TO BY
BLUE EYES AGED FOUR AND FIVE YEARS
THERE WERE THREE LITTLE COCKS WHO OWNED A COUNTRY WHERE THERE WERE
A GREAT MANY FLOWERS
THEY PLUCKED THE FLOWERS AND PUT THEM IN THEIR
POCKETS
AFTER THAT THEY PLUCKED THE LEAVES AND PUT THEM IN THEIR
PLAYTHINGS
THERE WAS A WOLF IN THAT COUNTRY THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF
FOREST AND THE WOLF WAS IN THE FOREST AND HE ATE THE LITTLE COCKS
AND THIS OTHER POEM
THERE CAME A BLOW WITH A STICK
IT WAS PUNCHINELLO WHO BESTOWED IT ON THE CAT
IT WAS NOT GOOD FOR HER IT HURT HER
THEN A LADY PUT PUNCHINELLO IN PRISON
IT WAS THERE THAT A LITTLE ABANDONED CHILD A FOUNDLING WHOM THE CONVENT
WAS BRINGING UP OUT OF CHARITY UTTERED THIS SWEET AND HEART BREAKING
SAYING
SHE HEARD THE OTHERS TALKING OF THEIR MOTHERS AND SHE MURMURED
IN HER CORNER
AS FOR ME MY MOTHER WAS NOT THERE WHEN I WAS BORN
THERE WAS A STOUT PORTRESS WHO COULD ALWAYS BE SEEN HURRYING THROUGH THE
CORRIDORS WITH HER BUNCH OF KEYS AND WHOSE NAME WAS SISTER AGATHA
THE
BIG BIG GIRLS THOSE OVER TEN YEARS OF AGE CALLED HER AGATHOCLES
THE REFECTORY A LARGE APARTMENT OF AN OBLONG SQUARE FORM WHICH
RECEIVED NO LIGHT EXCEPT THROUGH A VAULTED CLOISTER ON A LEVEL WITH THE
GARDEN WAS DARK AND DAMP AND AS THE CHILDREN SAY FULL OF BEASTS
ALL
THE PLACES ROUND ABOUT FURNISHED THEIR CONTINGENT OF INSECTS
EACH OF ITS FOUR CORNERS HAD RECEIVED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE PUPILS
A SPECIAL AND EXPRESSIVE NAME
THERE WAS SPIDER CORNER CATERPILLAR
CORNER WOOD LOUSE CORNER AND CRICKET CORNER
CRICKET CORNER WAS NEAR THE KITCHEN AND WAS HIGHLY ESTEEMED
IT WAS NOT
SO COLD THERE AS ELSEWHERE
FROM THE REFECTORY THE NAMES HAD PASSED TO
THE BOARDING SCHOOL AND THERE SERVED AS IN THE OLD COLLEGE MAZARIN
TO DISTINGUISH FOUR NATIONS
EVERY PUPIL BELONGED TO ONE OF THESE FOUR
NATIONS ACCORDING TO THE CORNER OF THE REFECTORY IN WHICH SHE SAT AT
MEALS
ONE DAY MONSEIGNEUR THE ARCHBISHOP WHILE MAKING HIS PASTORAL
VISIT SAW A PRETTY LITTLE ROSY GIRL WITH BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HAIR ENTER THE
CLASS ROOM THROUGH WHICH HE WAS PASSING
HE INQUIRED OF ANOTHER PUPIL A CHARMING BRUNETTE WITH ROSY CHEEKS WHO
STOOD NEAR HIM
WHO IS THAT
SHE IS A SPIDER MONSEIGNEUR
BAH AND THAT ONE YONDER
SHE IS A CRICKET
AND THAT ONE
SHE IS A CATERPILLAR
REALLY AND YOURSELF
I AM A WOOD LOUSE MONSEIGNEUR
EVERY HOUSE OF THIS SORT HAS ITS OWN PECULIARITIES
AT THE BEGINNING OF
THIS CENTURY ECOUEN WAS ONE OF THOSE STRICT AND GRACEFUL PLACES WHERE
YOUNG GIRLS PASS THEIR CHILDHOOD IN A SHADOW THAT IS ALMOST AUGUST
AT
ECOUEN IN ORDER TO TAKE RANK IN THE PROCESSION OF THE HOLY SACRAMENT
A DISTINCTION WAS MADE BETWEEN VIRGINS AND FLORISTS
THERE WERE ALSO THE
DAIS AND THE CENSORS THE FIRST WHO HELD THE CORDS OF THE DAIS AND
THE OTHERS WHO CARRIED INCENSE BEFORE THE HOLY SACRAMENT
THE FLOWERS
BELONGED BY RIGHT TO THE FLORISTS
FOUR VIRGINS WALKED IN ADVANCE
ON
THE MORNING OF THAT GREAT DAY IT WAS NO RARE THING TO HEAR THE QUESTION
PUT IN THE DORMITORY WHO IS A VIRGIN
MADAME CAMPAN USED TO QUOTE THIS SAYING OF A LITTLE ONE OF SEVEN
YEARS TO A BIG GIRL OF SIXTEEN WHO TOOK THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION
WHILE SHE THE LITTLE ONE REMAINED AT THE REAR YOU ARE A VIRGIN BUT
I AM NOT
CHAPTER V DISTRACTIONS
ABOVE THE DOOR OF THE REFECTORY THIS PRAYER WHICH WAS CALLED THE WHITE
PATERNOSTER AND WHICH POSSESSED THE PROPERTY OF BEARING PEOPLE STRAIGHT
TO PARADISE WAS INSCRIBED IN LARGE BLACK LETTERS
LITTLE WHITE PATERNOSTER WHICH GOD MADE WHICH GOD SAID WHICH GOD
PLACED IN PARADISE
IN THE EVENING WHEN I WENT TO BED I FOUND THREE
ANGELS SITTING ON MY BED ONE AT THE FOOT TWO AT THE HEAD THE GOOD
VIRGIN MARY IN THE MIDDLE WHO TOLD ME TO LIE DOWN WITHOUT HESITATION
THE GOOD GOD IS MY FATHER THE GOOD VIRGIN IS MY MOTHER THE THREE
APOSTLES ARE MY BROTHERS THE THREE VIRGINS ARE MY SISTERS
THE SHIRT IN
WHICH GOD WAS BORN ENVELOPES MY BODY SAINT MARGARET'S CROSS IS WRITTEN
ON MY BREAST
MADAME THE VIRGIN WAS WALKING THROUGH THE MEADOWS WEEPING
FOR GOD WHEN SHE MET M
SAINT JOHN
'MONSIEUR SAINT JOHN WHENCE COME
YOU 'I COME FROM AVE SALUS 'YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE GOOD GOD WHERE
IS HE 'HE IS ON THE TREE OF THE CROSS HIS FEET HANGING HIS HANDS
NAILED A LITTLE CAP OF WHITE THORNS ON HIS HEAD WHOEVER SHALL SAY
THIS THRICE AT EVENTIDE THRICE IN THE MORNING SHALL WIN PARADISE AT
THE LAST
IN 1827 THIS CHARACTERISTIC ORISON HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE WALL UNDER
A TRIPLE COATING OF DAUBING PAINT
AT THE PRESENT TIME IT IS FINALLY
DISAPPEARING FROM THE MEMORIES OF SEVERAL WHO WERE YOUNG GIRLS THEN AND
WHO ARE OLD WOMEN NOW
A LARGE CRUCIFIX FASTENED TO THE WALL COMPLETED THE DECORATION OF THIS
REFECTORY WHOSE ONLY DOOR AS WE THINK WE HAVE MENTIONED OPENED ON THE
GARDEN
TWO NARROW TABLES EACH FLANKED BY TWO WOODEN BENCHES FORMED
TWO LONG PARALLEL LINES FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER OF THE REFECTORY
THE WALLS WERE WHITE THE TABLES WERE BLACK THESE TWO MOURNING COLORS
CONSTITUTE THE ONLY VARIETY IN CONVENTS
THE MEALS WERE PLAIN AND
THE FOOD OF THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES SEVERE
A SINGLE DISH OF MEAT AND
VEGETABLES COMBINED OR SALT FISH SUCH WAS THEIR LUXURY
THIS MEAGRE
FARE WHICH WAS RESERVED FOR THE PUPILS ALONE WAS NEVERTHELESS AN
EXCEPTION
THE CHILDREN ATE IN SILENCE UNDER THE EYE OF THE MOTHER
WHOSE TURN IT WAS WHO IF A FLY TOOK A NOTION TO FLY OR TO HUM AGAINST
THE RULE OPENED AND SHUT A WOODEN BOOK FROM TIME TO TIME
THIS SILENCE
WAS SEASONED WITH THE LIVES OF THE SAINTS READ ALOUD FROM A LITTLE
PULPIT WITH A DESK WHICH WAS SITUATED AT THE FOOT OF THE CRUCIFIX
THE
READER WAS ONE OF THE BIG GIRLS IN WEEKLY TURN
AT REGULAR DISTANCES
ON THE BARE TABLES THERE WERE LARGE VARNISHED BOWLS IN WHICH THE
PUPILS WASHED THEIR OWN SILVER CUPS AND KNIVES AND FORKS AND INTO WHICH
THEY SOMETIMES THREW SOME SCRAP OF TOUGH MEAT OR SPOILED FISH THIS WAS
PUNISHED
THESE BOWLS WERE CALLED RONDS D'EAU
THE CHILD WHO BROKE THE
SILENCE MADE A CROSS WITH HER TONGUE WHERE ON THE GROUND
SHE LICKED
THE PAVEMENT
THE DUST THAT END OF ALL JOYS WAS CHARGED WITH THE
CHASTISEMENT OF THOSE POOR LITTLE ROSE LEAVES WHICH HAD BEEN GUILTY OF
CHIRPING
THERE WAS IN THE CONVENT A BOOK WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN PRINTED EXCEPT AS
A UNIQUE COPY AND WHICH IT IS FORBIDDEN TO READ
IT IS THE RULE OF
SAINT BENOIT
AN ARCANUM WHICH NO PROFANE EYE MUST PENETRATE
NEMO
REGULAS SEU CONSTITUTIONES NOSTRAS EXTERNIS COMMUNICABIT
THE PUPILS ONE DAY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING POSSESSION OF THIS BOOK AND SET
TO READING IT WITH AVIDITY A READING WHICH WAS OFTEN INTERRUPTED BY
THE FEAR OF BEING CAUGHT WHICH CAUSED THEM TO CLOSE THE VOLUME
PRECIPITATELY
FROM THE GREAT DANGER THUS INCURRED THEY DERIVED BUT A VERY MODERATE
AMOUNT OF PLEASURE
THE MOST INTERESTING THING THEY FOUND WERE SOME
UNINTELLIGIBLE PAGES ABOUT THE SINS OF YOUNG BOYS
THEY PLAYED IN AN ALLEY OF THE GARDEN BORDERED WITH A FEW SHABBY
FRUIT TREES
IN SPITE OF THE EXTREME SURVEILLANCE AND THE SEVERITY OF
THE PUNISHMENTS ADMINISTERED WHEN THE WIND HAD SHAKEN THE TREES THEY
SOMETIMES SUCCEEDED IN PICKING UP A GREEN APPLE OR A SPOILED APRICOT OR
AN INHABITED PEAR ON THE SLY
I WILL NOW CEDE THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEECH
TO A LETTER WHICH LIES BEFORE ME A LETTER WRITTEN FIVE AND TWENTY
YEARS AGO BY AN OLD PUPIL NOW MADAME LA DUCHESSE DE ONE OF THE MOST
ELEGANT WOMEN IN PARIS
I QUOTE LITERALLY ONE HIDES ONE'S PEAR OR
ONE'S APPLE AS BEST ONE MAY
WHEN ONE GOES UP STAIRS TO PUT THE VEIL ON
THE BED BEFORE SUPPER ONE STUFFS THEM UNDER ONE'S PILLOW AND AT NIGHT
ONE EATS THEM IN BED AND WHEN ONE CANNOT DO THAT ONE EATS THEM IN THE
CLOSET THAT WAS ONE OF THEIR GREATEST LUXURIES
ONCE IT WAS AT THE EPOCH OF THE VISIT FROM THE ARCHBISHOP TO THE
CONVENT ONE OF THE YOUNG GIRLS MADEMOISELLE BOUCHARD WHO WAS
CONNECTED WITH THE MONTMORENCY FAMILY LAID A WAGER THAT SHE WOULD ASK
FOR A DAY'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE AN ENORMITY IN SO AUSTERE A COMMUNITY
THE
WAGER WAS ACCEPTED BUT NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO BET BELIEVED THAT SHE WOULD
DO IT
WHEN THE MOMENT CAME AS THE ARCHBISHOP WAS PASSING IN FRONT OF
THE PUPILS MADEMOISELLE BOUCHARD TO THE INDESCRIBABLE TERROR OF HER
COMPANIONS STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS AND SAID MONSEIGNEUR A DAY'S
LEAVE OF ABSENCE MADEMOISELLE BOUCHARD WAS TALL BLOOMING WITH THE
PRETTIEST LITTLE ROSY FACE IN THE WORLD
M
DE QUELEN SMILED AND SAID
WHAT MY DEAR CHILD A DAY'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE THREE DAYS IF YOU LIKE
I GRANT YOU THREE DAYS THE PRIORESS COULD DO NOTHING THE ARCHBISHOP
HAD SPOKEN
HORROR OF THE CONVENT BUT JOY OF THE PUPIL
THE EFFECT MAY
BE IMAGINED
THIS STERN CLOISTER WAS NOT SO WELL WALLED OFF HOWEVER BUT THAT THE
LIFE OF THE PASSIONS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD DRAMA AND EVEN ROMANCE
DID NOT MAKE THEIR WAY IN
TO PROVE THIS WE WILL CONFINE OURSELVES TO
RECORDING HERE AND TO BRIEFLY MENTIONING A REAL AND INCONTESTABLE FACT
WHICH HOWEVER BEARS NO REFERENCE IN ITSELF TO AND IS NOT CONNECTED BY
ANY THREAD WHATEVER WITH THE STORY WHICH WE ARE RELATING
WE MENTION THE
FACT FOR THE SAKE OF COMPLETING THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE CONVENT IN THE
READER'S MIND
ABOUT THIS TIME THERE WAS IN THE CONVENT A MYSTERIOUS PERSON WHO WAS
NOT A NUN WHO WAS TREATED WITH GREAT RESPECT AND WHO WAS ADDRESSED AS
MADAME ALBERTINE
NOTHING WAS KNOWN ABOUT HER SAVE THAT SHE WAS MAD
AND THAT IN THE WORLD SHE PASSED FOR DEAD
BENEATH THIS HISTORY IT
WAS SAID THERE LAY THE ARRANGEMENTS OF FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR A GREAT
MARRIAGE
THIS WOMAN HARDLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE OF DARK COMPLEXION AND TOLERABLY
PRETTY HAD A VAGUE LOOK IN HER LARGE BLACK EYES
COULD SHE SEE THERE
WAS SOME DOUBT ABOUT THIS
SHE GLIDED RATHER THAN WALKED SHE NEVER
SPOKE IT WAS NOT QUITE KNOWN WHETHER SHE BREATHED
HER NOSTRILS WERE
LIVID AND PINCHED AS AFTER YIELDING UP THEIR LAST SIGH
TO TOUCH HER
HAND WAS LIKE TOUCHING SNOW
SHE POSSESSED A STRANGE SPECTRAL GRACE
WHEREVER SHE ENTERED PEOPLE FELT COLD
ONE DAY A SISTER ON SEEING HER
PASS SAID TO ANOTHER SISTER SHE PASSES FOR A DEAD WOMAN PERHAPS
SHE IS ONE REPLIED THE OTHER
A HUNDRED TALES WERE TOLD OF MADAME ALBERTINE
THIS AROSE FROM THE
ETERNAL CURIOSITY OF THE PUPILS
IN THE CHAPEL THERE WAS A GALLERY
CALLED L'OEIL DE BOEUF
IT WAS IN THIS GALLERY WHICH HAD ONLY A
CIRCULAR BAY AN OEIL DE BOEUF THAT MADAME ALBERTINE LISTENED TO THE
OFFICES
SHE ALWAYS OCCUPIED IT ALONE BECAUSE FROM THIS GALLERY BEING
ON THE LEVEL OF THE FIRST STORY THE PREACHER OR THE OFFICIATING PRIEST
COULD BE SEEN WHICH WAS INTERDICTED TO THE NUNS
ONE DAY THE PULPIT WAS
OCCUPIED BY A YOUNG PRIEST OF HIGH RANK M
LE DUC DE ROHAN PEER OF
FRANCE OFFICER OF THE RED MUSKETEERS IN 1815 WHEN HE WAS PRINCE DE
LEON AND WHO DIED AFTERWARD IN 1830 AS CARDINAL AND ARCHBISHOP OF
BESANCON
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT M
DE ROHAN HAD PREACHED AT THE
PETIT PICPUS CONVENT
MADAME ALBERTINE USUALLY PRESERVED PERFECT
CALMNESS AND COMPLETE IMMOBILITY DURING THE SERMONS AND SERVICES
THAT
DAY AS SOON AS SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF M
DE ROHAN SHE HALF ROSE AND
SAID IN A LOUD VOICE AMID THE SILENCE OF THE CHAPEL AH AUGUSTE
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY TURNED THEIR HEADS IN AMAZEMENT THE PREACHER RAISED
HIS EYES BUT MADAME ALBERTINE HAD RELAPSED INTO HER IMMOBILITY
A
BREATH FROM THE OUTER WORLD A FLASH OF LIFE HAD PASSED FOR AN INSTANT
ACROSS THAT COLD AND LIFELESS FACE AND HAD THEN VANISHED AND THE MAD
WOMAN HAD BECOME A CORPSE AGAIN
THOSE TWO WORDS HOWEVER HAD SET EVERY ONE IN THE CONVENT WHO HAD THE
PRIVILEGE OF SPEECH TO CHATTERING
HOW MANY THINGS WERE CONTAINED IN
THAT AH AUGUSTE WHAT REVELATIONS M
DE ROHAN'S NAME REALLY WAS
AUGUSTE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MADAME ALBERTINE BELONGED TO THE VERY
HIGHEST SOCIETY SINCE SHE KNEW M
DE ROHAN AND THAT HER OWN RANK THERE
WAS OF THE HIGHEST SINCE SHE SPOKE THUS FAMILIARLY OF SO GREAT A LORD
AND THAT THERE EXISTED BETWEEN THEM SOME CONNECTION OF RELATIONSHIP
PERHAPS BUT A VERY CLOSE ONE IN ANY CASE SINCE SHE KNEW HIS PET
NAME
TWO VERY SEVERE DUCHESSES MESDAMES DE CHOISEUL AND DE SERENT OFTEN
VISITED THE COMMUNITY WHITHER THEY PENETRATED NO DOUBT IN VIRTUE OF
THE PRIVILEGE MAGNATES MULIERES AND CAUSED GREAT CONSTERNATION IN THE
BOARDING SCHOOL
WHEN THESE TWO OLD LADIES PASSED BY ALL THE POOR YOUNG
GIRLS TREMBLED AND DROPPED THEIR EYES
MOREOVER M
DE ROHAN QUITE UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF WAS AN OBJECT OF
ATTENTION TO THE SCHOOL GIRLS
AT THAT EPOCH HE HAD JUST BEEN MADE
WHILE WAITING FOR THE EPISCOPATE VICAR GENERAL OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF
PARIS
IT WAS ONE OF HIS HABITS TO COME TOLERABLY OFTEN TO CELEBRATE THE
OFFICES IN THE CHAPEL OF THE NUNS OF THE PETIT PICPUS
NOT ONE OF THE
YOUNG RECLUSES COULD SEE HIM BECAUSE OF THE SERGE CURTAIN BUT HE HAD
A SWEET AND RATHER SHRILL VOICE WHICH THEY HAD COME TO KNOW AND TO
DISTINGUISH
HE HAD BEEN A MOUSQUETAIRE AND THEN HE WAS SAID TO BE
VERY COQUETTISH THAT HIS HANDSOME BROWN HAIR WAS VERY WELL DRESSED IN
A ROLL AROUND HIS HEAD AND THAT HE HAD A BROAD GIRDLE OF MAGNIFICENT
MOIRE AND THAT HIS BLACK CASSOCK WAS OF THE MOST ELEGANT CUT IN THE
WORLD
HE HELD A GREAT PLACE IN ALL THESE IMAGINATIONS OF SIXTEEN YEARS
NOT A SOUND FROM WITHOUT MADE ITS WAY INTO THE CONVENT
BUT THERE WAS
ONE YEAR WHEN THE SOUND OF A FLUTE PENETRATED THITHER
THIS WAS AN
EVENT AND THE GIRLS WHO WERE AT SCHOOL THERE AT THE TIME STILL RECALL
IT
IT WAS A FLUTE WHICH WAS PLAYED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THIS FLUTE ALWAYS
PLAYED THE SAME AIR AN AIR WHICH IS VERY FAR AWAY NOWADAYS MY
ZETULBE COME REIGN O'ER MY SOUL AND IT WAS HEARD TWO OR THREE
TIMES A DAY
THE YOUNG GIRLS PASSED HOURS IN LISTENING TO IT THE VOCAL
MOTHERS WERE UPSET BY IT BRAINS WERE BUSY PUNISHMENTS DESCENDED IN
SHOWERS
THIS LASTED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS
THE GIRLS WERE ALL MORE OR
LESS IN LOVE WITH THE UNKNOWN MUSICIAN
EACH ONE DREAMED THAT SHE WAS
ZETULBE
THE SOUND OF THE FLUTE PROCEEDED FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE RUE
DROIT MUR AND THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING COMPROMISED EVERYTHING
ATTEMPTED ANYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF SEEING OF CATCHING A GLANCE IF ONLY
FOR A SECOND OF THE YOUNG MAN WHO PLAYED THAT FLUTE SO DELICIOUSLY
AND WHO NO DOUBT PLAYED ON ALL THESE SOULS AT THE SAME TIME
THERE
WERE SOME WHO MADE THEIR ESCAPE BY A BACK DOOR AND ASCENDED TO THE
THIRD STORY ON THE RUE DROIT MUR SIDE IN ORDER TO ATTEMPT TO CATCH A
GLIMPSE THROUGH THE GAPS
IMPOSSIBLE ONE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO THRUST
HER ARM THROUGH THE GRATING AND TO WAVE HER WHITE HANDKERCHIEF
TWO
WERE STILL BOLDER
THEY FOUND MEANS TO CLIMB ON A ROOF AND RISKED THEIR
LIVES THERE AND SUCCEEDED AT LAST IN SEEING THE YOUNG MAN HE WAS AN
OLD EMIGRE GENTLEMAN BLIND AND PENNILESS WHO WAS PLAYING HIS FLUTE IN
HIS ATTIC IN ORDER TO PASS THE TIME
CHAPTER VI THE LITTLE CONVENT
IN THIS ENCLOSURE OF THE PETIT PICPUS THERE WERE THREE PERFECTLY
DISTINCT BUILDINGS THE GREAT CONVENT INHABITED BY THE NUNS THE
BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE THE SCHOLARS WERE LODGED AND LASTLY WHAT WAS
CALLED THE LITTLE CONVENT
IT WAS A BUILDING WITH A GARDEN IN WHICH
LIVED ALL SORTS OF AGED NUNS OF VARIOUS ORDERS THE RELICS OF CLOISTERS
DESTROYED IN THE REVOLUTION A REUNION OF ALL THE BLACK GRAY AND WHITE
MEDLEYS OF ALL COMMUNITIES AND ALL POSSIBLE VARIETIES WHAT MIGHT BE
CALLED IF SUCH A COUPLING OF WORDS IS PERMISSIBLE A SORT OF HARLEQUIN
CONVENT
WHEN THE EMPIRE WAS ESTABLISHED ALL THESE POOR OLD DISPERSED AND EXILED
WOMEN HAD BEEN ACCORDED PERMISSION TO COME AND TAKE SHELTER UNDER THE
WINGS OF THE BERNARDINES BENEDICTINES
THE GOVERNMENT PAID THEM A SMALL
PENSION THE LADIES OF THE PETIT PICPUS RECEIVED THEM CORDIALLY
IT WAS
A SINGULAR PELL MELL
EACH FOLLOWED HER OWN RULE SOMETIMES THE PUPILS
OF THE BOARDING SCHOOL WERE ALLOWED AS A GREAT RECREATION TO PAY THEM
A VISIT THE RESULT IS THAT ALL THOSE YOUNG MEMORIES HAVE
RETAINED AMONG OTHER SOUVENIRS THAT OF MOTHER SAINTE BAZILE MOTHER
SAINTE SCOLASTIQUE AND MOTHER JACOB
ONE OF THESE REFUGEES FOUND HERSELF ALMOST AT HOME
SHE WAS A NUN OF
SAINTE AURE THE ONLY ONE OF HER ORDER WHO HAD SURVIVED
THE ANCIENT
CONVENT OF THE LADIES OF SAINTE AURE OCCUPIED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THIS VERY HOUSE OF THE PETIT PICPUS WHICH BELONGED
LATER TO THE BENEDICTINES OF MARTIN VERGA
THIS HOLY WOMAN TOO POOR TO
WEAR THE MAGNIFICENT HABIT OF HER ORDER WHICH WAS A WHITE ROBE WITH
A SCARLET SCAPULARY HAD PIOUSLY PUT IT ON A LITTLE MANIKIN WHICH SHE
EXHIBITED WITH COMPLACENCY AND WHICH SHE BEQUEATHED TO THE HOUSE AT
HER DEATH
IN 1824 ONLY ONE NUN OF THIS ORDER REMAINED TO DAY THERE
REMAINS ONLY A DOLL
IN ADDITION TO THESE WORTHY MOTHERS SOME OLD SOCIETY WOMEN HAD OBTAINED
PERMISSION OF THE PRIORESS LIKE MADAME ALBERTINE TO RETIRE INTO THE
LITTLE CONVENT
AMONG THE NUMBER WERE MADAME BEAUFORT D'HAUTPOUL AND
MARQUISE DUFRESNE
ANOTHER WAS NEVER KNOWN IN THE CONVENT EXCEPT BY
THE FORMIDABLE NOISE WHICH SHE MADE WHEN SHE BLEW HER NOSE
THE PUPILS
CALLED HER MADAME VACARMINI HUBBUB
ABOUT 1820 OR 1821 MADAME DE GENLIS WHO WAS AT THAT TIME EDITING A
LITTLE PERIODICAL PUBLICATION CALLED L'INTREPIDE ASKED TO BE ALLOWED
TO ENTER THE CONVENT OF THE PETIT PICPUS AS LADY RESIDENT
THE DUC
D'ORLEANS RECOMMENDED HER
UPROAR IN THE HIVE THE VOCAL MOTHERS WERE
ALL IN A FLUTTER MADAME DE GENLIS HAD MADE ROMANCES
BUT SHE DECLARED
THAT SHE WAS THE FIRST TO DETEST THEM AND THEN SHE HAD REACHED HER
FIERCE STAGE OF DEVOTION
WITH THE AID OF GOD AND OF THE PRINCE SHE
ENTERED
SHE DEPARTED AT THE END OF SIX OR EIGHT MONTHS ALLEGING AS A
REASON THAT THERE WAS NO SHADE IN THE GARDEN
THE NUNS WERE DELIGHTED
ALTHOUGH VERY OLD SHE STILL PLAYED THE HARP AND DID IT VERY WELL
WHEN SHE WENT AWAY SHE LEFT HER MARK IN HER CELL
MADAME DE GENLIS WAS
SUPERSTITIOUS AND A LATINIST
THESE TWO WORDS FURNISH A TOLERABLY GOOD
PROFILE OF HER
A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WERE STILL TO BE SEEN PASTED IN
THE INSIDE OF A LITTLE CUPBOARD IN HER CELL IN WHICH SHE LOCKED UP HER
SILVERWARE AND HER JEWELS THESE FIVE LINES IN LATIN WRITTEN WITH
HER OWN HAND IN RED INK ON YELLOW PAPER AND WHICH IN HER OPINION
POSSESSED THE PROPERTY OF FRIGHTENING AWAY ROBBERS
IMPARIBUS MERITIS PENDENT TRIA CORPORA RAMIS 15
DISMAS ET GESMAS MEDIA EST DIVINA POTESTAS
ALTA PETIT DISMAS INFELIX INFIMA GESMAS
NOS ET RES NOSTRAS CONSERVET SUMMA POTESTAS
HOS VERSUS DICAS NE TU FURTO TUA PERDAS
THESE VERSES IN SIXTH CENTURY LATIN RAISE THE QUESTION WHETHER THE
TWO THIEVES OF CALVARY WERE NAMED AS IS COMMONLY BELIEVED DISMAS AND
GESTAS OR DISMAS AND GESMAS
THIS ORTHOGRAPHY MIGHT HAVE CONFOUNDED THE
PRETENSIONS PUT FORWARD IN THE LAST CENTURY BY THE VICOMTE DE GESTAS OF
A DESCENT FROM THE WICKED THIEF
HOWEVER THE USEFUL VIRTUE ATTACHED TO
THESE VERSES FORMS AN ARTICLE OF FAITH IN THE ORDER OF THE HOSPITALLERS
THE CHURCH OF THE HOUSE CONSTRUCTED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO SEPARATE THE
GREAT CONVENT FROM THE BOARDING SCHOOL LIKE A VERITABLE INTRENCHMENT
WAS OF COURSE COMMON TO THE BOARDING SCHOOL THE GREAT CONVENT AND
THE LITTLE CONVENT
THE PUBLIC WAS EVEN ADMITTED BY A SORT OF LAZARETTO
ENTRANCE ON THE STREET
BUT ALL WAS SO ARRANGED THAT NONE OF THE
INHABITANTS OF THE CLOISTER COULD SEE A FACE FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD
SUPPOSE A CHURCH WHOSE CHOIR IS GRASPED IN A GIGANTIC HAND AND
FOLDED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO FORM NOT AS IN ORDINARY CHURCHES A
PROLONGATION BEHIND THE ALTAR BUT A SORT OF HALL OR OBSCURE CELLAR TO
THE RIGHT OF THE OFFICIATING PRIEST SUPPOSE THIS HALL TO BE SHUT OFF BY
A CURTAIN SEVEN FEET IN HEIGHT OF WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN IN THE
SHADOW OF THAT CURTAIN PILE UP ON WOODEN STALLS THE NUNS IN THE CHOIR
ON THE LEFT THE SCHOOL GIRLS ON THE RIGHT THE LAY SISTERS AND THE
NOVICES AT THE BOTTOM AND YOU WILL HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE NUNS OF THE
PETIT PICPUS ASSISTING AT DIVINE SERVICE
THAT CAVERN WHICH WAS CALLED
THE CHOIR COMMUNICATED WITH THE CLOISTER BY A LOBBY
THE CHURCH WAS
LIGHTED FROM THE GARDEN
WHEN THE NUNS WERE PRESENT AT SERVICES WHERE
THEIR RULE ENJOINED SILENCE THE PUBLIC WAS WARNED OF THEIR PRESENCE
ONLY BY THE FOLDING SEATS OF THE STALLS NOISILY RISING AND FALLING
CHAPTER VII SOME SILHOUETTES OF THIS DARKNESS
DURING THE SIX YEARS WHICH SEPARATE 1819 FROM 1825 THE PRIORESS OF THE
PETIT PICPUS WAS MADEMOISELLE DE BLEMEUR WHOSE NAME IN RELIGION
WAS MOTHER INNOCENTE
SHE CAME OF THE FAMILY OF MARGUERITE DE BLEMEUR
AUTHOR OF LIVES OF THE SAINTS OF THE ORDER OF SAINT BENOIT
SHE HAD
BEEN RE ELECTED
SHE WAS A WOMAN ABOUT SIXTY YEARS OF AGE SHORT THICK
SINGING LIKE A CRACKED POT SAYS THE LETTER WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY
QUOTED AN EXCELLENT WOMAN MOREOVER AND THE ONLY MERRY ONE IN THE
WHOLE CONVENT AND FOR THAT REASON ADORED
SHE WAS LEARNED ERUDITE
WISE COMPETENT CURIOUSLY PROFICIENT IN HISTORY CRAMMED WITH LATIN
STUFFED WITH GREEK FULL OF HEBREW AND MORE OF A BENEDICTINE MONK THAN
A BENEDICTINE NUN
THE SUB PRIORESS WAS AN OLD SPANISH NUN MOTHER CINERES WHO WAS ALMOST
BLIND
THE MOST ESTEEMED AMONG THE VOCAL MOTHERS WERE MOTHER SAINTE HONORINE
THE TREASURER MOTHER SAINTE GERTRUDE THE CHIEF MISTRESS OF THE
NOVICES MOTHER SAINT ANGE THE ASSISTANT MISTRESS MOTHER ANNONCIATION
THE SACRISTAN MOTHER SAINT AUGUSTIN THE NURSE THE ONLY ONE IN THE
CONVENT WHO WAS MALICIOUS THEN MOTHER SAINTE MECHTILDE MADEMOISELLE
GAUVAIN VERY YOUNG AND WITH A BEAUTIFUL VOICE MOTHER DES ANGES
MADEMOISELLE DROUET WHO HAD BEEN IN THE CONVENT OF THE FILLES DIEU
AND IN THE CONVENT DU TRESOR BETWEEN GISORS AND MAGNY MOTHER
SAINT JOSEPH MADEMOISELLE DE COGOLLUDO MOTHER SAINTE ADELAIDE
MADEMOISELLE D'AUVERNEY MOTHER MISERICORDE MADEMOISELLE DE
CIFUENTES WHO COULD NOT RESIST AUSTERITIES MOTHER COMPASSION
MADEMOISELLE DE LA MILTIERE RECEIVED AT THE AGE OF SIXTY IN DEFIANCE
OF THE RULE AND VERY WEALTHY MOTHER PROVIDENCE MADEMOISELLE DE
LAUDINIERE MOTHER PRESENTATION MADEMOISELLE DE SIGUENZA WHO WAS
PRIORESS IN 1847 AND FINALLY MOTHER SAINTE CELIGNE SISTER OF THE
SCULPTOR CERACCHI WHO WENT MAD MOTHER SAINTE CHANTAL MADEMOISELLE DE
SUZON WHO WENT MAD
THERE WAS ALSO AMONG THE PRETTIEST OF THEM A CHARMING GIRL OF THREE
AND TWENTY WHO WAS FROM THE ISLE DE BOURBON A DESCENDANT OF THE
CHEVALIER ROZE WHOSE NAME HAD BEEN MADEMOISELLE ROZE AND WHO WAS
CALLED MOTHER ASSUMPTION
MOTHER SAINTE MECHTILDE INTRUSTED WITH THE SINGING AND THE CHOIR WAS
FOND OF MAKING USE OF THE PUPILS IN THIS QUARTER
SHE USUALLY TOOK A
COMPLETE SCALE OF THEM THAT IS TO SAY SEVEN FROM TEN TO SIXTEEN YEARS
OF AGE INCLUSIVE OF ASSORTED VOICES AND SIZES WHOM SHE MADE SING
STANDING DRAWN UP IN A LINE SIDE BY SIDE ACCORDING TO AGE FROM THE
SMALLEST TO THE LARGEST
THIS PRESENTED TO THE EYE SOMETHING IN THE
NATURE OF A REED PIPE OF YOUNG GIRLS A SORT OF LIVING PAN PIPE MADE OF
ANGELS
THOSE OF THE LAY SISTERS WHOM THE SCHOLARS LOVED MOST WERE SISTER
EUPHRASIE SISTER SAINTE MARGUERITE SISTER SAINTE MARTHE WHO WAS IN
HER DOTAGE AND SISTER SAINTE MICHEL WHOSE LONG NOSE MADE THEM LAUGH
ALL THESE WOMEN WERE GENTLE WITH THE CHILDREN
THE NUNS WERE SEVERE ONLY
TOWARDS THEMSELVES
NO FIRE WAS LIGHTED EXCEPT IN THE SCHOOL AND THE
FOOD WAS CHOICE COMPARED TO THAT IN THE CONVENT
MOREOVER THEY LAVISHED
A THOUSAND CARES ON THEIR SCHOLARS
ONLY WHEN A CHILD PASSED NEAR A NUN
AND ADDRESSED HER THE NUN NEVER REPLIED
THIS RULE OF SILENCE HAD HAD THIS EFFECT THAT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE
CONVENT SPEECH HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM HUMAN CREATURES AND BESTOWED
ON INANIMATE OBJECTS
NOW IT WAS THE CHURCH BELL WHICH SPOKE NOW IT WAS
THE GARDENER'S BELL
A VERY SONOROUS BELL PLACED BESIDE THE PORTRESS
AND WHICH WAS AUDIBLE THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE INDICATED BY ITS VARIED
PEALS WHICH FORMED A SORT OF ACOUSTIC TELEGRAPH ALL THE ACTIONS OF
MATERIAL LIFE WHICH WERE TO BE PERFORMED AND SUMMONED TO THE PARLOR IN
CASE OF NEED SUCH OR SUCH AN INHABITANT OF THE HOUSE
EACH PERSON
AND EACH THING HAD ITS OWN PEAL
THE PRIORESS HAD ONE AND ONE THE
SUB PRIORESS ONE AND TWO
SIX FIVE ANNOUNCED LESSONS SO THAT THE PUPILS
NEVER SAID TO GO TO LESSONS BUT TO GO TO SIX FIVE FOUR FOUR WAS
MADAME DE GENLIS'S SIGNAL
IT WAS VERY OFTEN HEARD
C'EST LE DIABLE
A QUATRE IT'S THE VERY DEUCE SAID THE UNCHARITABLE
TENNINE STROKES
ANNOUNCED A GREAT EVENT
IT WAS THE OPENING OF THE DOOR OF SECLUSION
A FRIGHTFUL SHEET OF IRON BRISTLING WITH BOLTS WHICH ONLY TURNED ON ITS
HINGES IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ARCHBISHOP
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ARCHBISHOP AND THE GARDENER NO MAN ENTERED
THE CONVENT AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID
THE SCHOOLGIRLS SAW TWO OTHERS
ONE THE CHAPLAIN THE ABBE BANES OLD AND UGLY WHOM THEY WERE
PERMITTED TO CONTEMPLATE IN THE CHOIR THROUGH A GRATING THE OTHER THE
DRAWING MASTER M
ANSIAUX WHOM THE LETTER OF WHICH WE HAVE PERUSED A
FEW LINES CALLS M
ANCIOT AND DESCRIBES AS A FRIGHTFUL OLD HUNCHBACK
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT ALL THESE MEN WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN
SUCH WAS THIS CURIOUS HOUSE
CHAPTER VIII POST CORDA LAPIDES
AFTER HAVING SKETCHED ITS MORAL FACE IT WILL NOT PROVE UNPROFITABLE
TO POINT OUT IN A FEW WORDS ITS MATERIAL CONFIGURATION
THE READER
ALREADY HAS SOME IDEA OF IT
THE CONVENT OF THE PETIT PICPUS SAINTE ANTOINE FILLED ALMOST THE WHOLE
OF THE VAST TRAPEZIUM WHICH RESULTED FROM THE INTERSECTION OF THE RUE
POLONCEAU THE RUE DROIT MUR THE RUE PETIT PICPUS AND THE UNUSED LANE
CALLED RUE AUMARAIS ON OLD PLANS
THESE FOUR STREETS SURROUNDED THIS
TRAPEZIUM LIKE A MOAT
THE CONVENT WAS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL BUILDINGS
AND A GARDEN
THE PRINCIPAL BUILDING TAKEN IN ITS ENTIRETY WAS A
JUXTAPOSITION OF HYBRID CONSTRUCTIONS WHICH VIEWED FROM A BIRD'S EYE
VIEW OUTLINED WITH CONSIDERABLE EXACTNESS A GIBBET LAID FLAT ON THE
GROUND
THE MAIN ARM OF THE GIBBET OCCUPIED THE WHOLE OF THE FRAGMENT
OF THE RUE DROIT MUR COMPRISED BETWEEN THE RUE PETIT PICPUS AND THE RUE
POLONCEAU THE LESSER ARM WAS A LOFTY GRAY SEVERE GRATED FACADE WHICH
FACED THE RUE PETIT PICPUS THE CARRIAGE ENTRANCE NO
62 MARKED ITS
EXTREMITY
TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THIS FACADE WAS A LOW ARCHED DOOR
WHITENED WITH DUST AND ASHES WHERE THE SPIDERS WOVE THEIR WEBS
AND WHICH WAS OPEN ONLY FOR AN HOUR OR TWO ON SUNDAYS AND ON RARE
OCCASIONS WHEN THE COFFIN OF A NUN LEFT THE CONVENT
THIS WAS THE
PUBLIC ENTRANCE OF THE CHURCH
THE ELBOW OF THE GIBBET WAS A SQUARE
HALL WHICH WAS USED AS THE SERVANTS' HALL AND WHICH THE NUNS CALLED THE
BUTTERY
IN THE MAIN ARM WERE THE CELLS OF THE MOTHERS THE SISTERS AND
THE NOVICES
IN THE LESSER ARM LAY THE KITCHENS THE REFECTORY BACKED
UP BY THE CLOISTERS AND THE CHURCH
BETWEEN THE DOOR NO
62 AND THE
CORNER OF THE CLOSED LANE AUMARAIS WAS THE SCHOOL WHICH WAS NOT
VISIBLE FROM WITHOUT
THE REMAINDER OF THE TRAPEZIUM FORMED THE GARDEN
WHICH WAS MUCH LOWER THAN THE LEVEL OF THE RUE POLONCEAU WHICH CAUSED
THE WALLS TO BE VERY MUCH HIGHER ON THE INSIDE THAN ON THE OUTSIDE
THE
GARDEN WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY ARCHED HAD IN ITS CENTRE ON THE SUMMIT OF
A HILLOCK A FINE POINTED AND CONICAL FIR TREE WHENCE RAN AS FROM
THE PEAKED BOSS OF A SHIELD FOUR GRAND ALLEYS AND RANGED BY TWOS
IN BETWEEN THE BRANCHINGS OF THESE EIGHT SMALL ONES SO THAT IF THE
ENCLOSURE HAD BEEN CIRCULAR THE GEOMETRICAL PLAN OF THE ALLEYS WOULD
HAVE RESEMBLED A CROSS SUPERPOSED ON A WHEEL
AS THE ALLEYS ALL ENDED
IN THE VERY IRREGULAR WALLS OF THE GARDEN THEY WERE OF UNEQUAL LENGTH
THEY WERE BORDERED WITH CURRANT BUSHES
AT THE BOTTOM AN ALLEY OF TALL
POPLARS RAN FROM THE RUINS OF THE OLD CONVENT WHICH WAS AT THE ANGLE OF
THE RUE DROIT MUR TO THE HOUSE OF THE LITTLE CONVENT WHICH WAS AT THE
ANGLE OF THE AUMARAIS LANE
IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE CONVENT WAS WHAT WAS
CALLED THE LITTLE GARDEN
TO THIS WHOLE LET THE READER ADD A COURTYARD
ALL SORTS OF VARIED ANGLES FORMED BY THE INTERIOR BUILDINGS PRISON
WALLS THE LONG BLACK LINE OF ROOFS WHICH BORDERED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
RUE POLONCEAU FOR ITS SOLE PERSPECTIVE AND NEIGHBORHOOD AND HE WILL
BE ABLE TO FORM FOR HIMSELF A COMPLETE IMAGE OF WHAT THE HOUSE OF THE
BERNARDINES OF THE PETIT PICPUS WAS FORTY YEARS AGO
THIS HOLY HOUSE
HAD BEEN BUILT ON THE PRECISE SITE OF A FAMOUS TENNIS GROUND OF THE
FOURTEENTH TO THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY WHICH WAS CALLED THE TENNIS GROUND
OF THE ELEVEN THOUSAND DEVILS
ALL THESE STREETS MOREOVER WERE MORE ANCIENT THAN PARIS
THESE NAMES
DROIT MUR AND AUMARAIS ARE VERY ANCIENT THE STREETS WHICH BEAR THEM
ARE VERY MUCH MORE ANCIENT STILL
AUMARAIS LANE WAS CALLED MAUGOUT LANE
THE RUE DROIT MUR WAS CALLED THE RUE DES EGLANTIERS FOR GOD OPENED
FLOWERS BEFORE MAN CUT STONES
CHAPTER IX A CENTURY UNDER A GUIMPE
SINCE WE ARE ENGAGED IN GIVING DETAILS AS TO WHAT THE CONVENT OF THE
PETIT PICPUS WAS IN FORMER TIMES AND SINCE WE HAVE VENTURED TO OPEN
A WINDOW ON THAT DISCREET RETREAT THE READER WILL PERMIT US ONE OTHER
LITTLE DIGRESSION UTTERLY FOREIGN TO THIS BOOK BUT CHARACTERISTIC AND
USEFUL SINCE IT SHOWS THAT THE CLOISTER EVEN HAS ITS ORIGINAL FIGURES
IN THE LITTLE CONVENT THERE WAS A CENTENARIAN WHO CAME FROM THE ABBEY
OF FONTEVRAULT
SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
SHE
TALKED A GREAT DEAL OF M
DE MIROMESNIL KEEPER OF THE SEALS UNDER LOUIS
XVI
AND OF A PRESIDENTESS DUPLAT WITH WHOM SHE HAD BEEN VERY INTIMATE
IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES ON EVERY
PRETEXT
SHE TOLD WONDERS OF THE ABBEY OF FONTEVRAULT THAT IT WAS LIKE
A CITY AND THAT THERE WERE STREETS IN THE MONASTERY
SHE TALKED WITH A PICARD ACCENT WHICH AMUSED THE PUPILS
EVERY YEAR
SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE
SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR
SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR
SAINT EUSEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR
SAINT PROCOPIUS ETC ETC AND THUS I GIVE IT TO YOU FATHER AND THE
SCHOOL GIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER
THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS
FROWN
ON ANOTHER OCCASION THE CENTENARIAN WAS TELLING STORIES
SHE SAID
THAT IN HER YOUTH THE BERNARDINE MONKS WERE EVERY WHIT AS GOOD AS THE
MOUSQUETAIRES
IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
SHE TOLD ABOUT THE CUSTOM OF THE FOUR WINES WHICH
EXISTED BEFORE THE REVOLUTION IN CHAMPAGNE AND BOURGOGNE
WHEN A GREAT
PERSONAGE A MARSHAL OF FRANCE A PRINCE A DUKE AND A PEER TRAVERSED
A TOWN IN BURGUNDY OR CHAMPAGNE THE CITY FATHERS CAME OUT TO HARANGUE
HIM AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FOUR SILVER GONDOLAS INTO WHICH THEY
HAD POURED FOUR DIFFERENT SORTS OF WINE
ON THE FIRST GOBLET THIS
INSCRIPTION COULD BE READ MONKEY WINE ON THE SECOND LION WINE ON THE
THIRD SHEEP WINE ON THE FOURTH HOG WINE
THESE FOUR LEGENDS EXPRESS
THE FOUR STAGES DESCENDED BY THE DRUNKARD THE FIRST INTOXICATION
WHICH ENLIVENS THE SECOND THAT WHICH IRRITATES THE THIRD THAT WHICH
DULLS AND THE FOURTH THAT WHICH BRUTALIZES
IN A CUPBOARD UNDER LOCK AND KEY SHE KEPT A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT OF WHICH
SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL
THE RULE OF FONTEVRAULT DID NOT FORBID THIS
SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THIS OBJECT TO ANYONE
SHE SHUT HERSELF UP WHICH HER
RULE ALLOWED HER TO DO AND HID HERSELF EVERY TIME THAT SHE DESIRED TO
CONTEMPLATE IT
IF SHE HEARD A FOOTSTEP IN THE CORRIDOR SHE CLOSED THE
CUPBOARD AGAIN AS HASTILY AS IT WAS POSSIBLE WITH HER AGED HANDS
AS
SOON AS IT WAS MENTIONED TO HER SHE BECAME SILENT SHE WHO WAS SO FOND
OF TALKING
THE MOST CURIOUS WERE BAFFLED BY HER SILENCE AND THE MOST
TENACIOUS BY HER OBSTINACY
THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR
ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
WHAT COULD THAT
TREASURE OF THE CENTENARIAN BE WHICH WAS SO PRECIOUS AND SO SECRET
SOME HOLY BOOK NO DOUBT SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC
THEY LOST THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURES
WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED
THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND
OPENED IT
THEY FOUND THE OBJECT BENEATH A TRIPLE LINEN CLOTH LIKE SOME
CONSECRATED PATEN
IT WAS A FAENZA PLATTER REPRESENTING LITTLE LOVES
FLITTING AWAY PURSUED BY APOTHECARY LADS ARMED WITH ENORMOUS SYRINGES
THE CHASE ABOUNDS IN GRIMACES AND IN COMICAL POSTURES
ONE OF THE
CHARMING LITTLE LOVES IS ALREADY FAIRLY SPITTED
HE IS RESISTING
FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE
DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE
COLIC
THIS PLATTER WHICH IS VERY CURIOUS AND WHICH HAD POSSIBLY
THE HONOR OF FURNISHING MOLIERE WITH AN IDEA WAS STILL IN EXISTENCE
IN SEPTEMBER 1845 IT WAS FOR SALE BY A BRIC A BRAC MERCHANT IN THE
BOULEVARD BEAUMARCHAIS
THIS GOOD OLD WOMAN WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY VISITS FROM OUTSIDE BECAUSE
SAID SHE THE PARLOR IS TOO GLOOMY
CHAPTER X ORIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION
HOWEVER THIS ALMOST SEPULCHRAL PARLOR OF WHICH WE HAVE SOUGHT TO
CONVEY AN IDEA IS A PURELY LOCAL TRAIT WHICH IS NOT REPRODUCED WITH THE
SAME SEVERITY IN OTHER CONVENTS
AT THE CONVENT OF THE RUE DU TEMPLE
IN PARTICULAR WHICH BELONGED IN TRUTH TO ANOTHER ORDER THE BLACK
SHUTTERS WERE REPLACED BY BROWN CURTAINS AND THE PARLOR ITSELF WAS A
SALON WITH A POLISHED WOOD FLOOR WHOSE WINDOWS WERE DRAPED IN WHITE
MUSLIN CURTAINS AND WHOSE WALLS ADMITTED ALL SORTS OF FRAMES A PORTRAIT
OF A BENEDICTINE NUN WITH UNVEILED FACE PAINTED BOUQUETS AND EVEN THE
HEAD OF A TURK
IT IS IN THAT GARDEN OF THE TEMPLE CONVENT THAT STOOD THAT FAMOUS
CHESTNUT TREE WHICH WAS RENOWNED AS THE FINEST AND THE LARGEST IN
FRANCE AND WHICH BORE THE REPUTATION AMONG THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THE
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY OF BEING THE FATHER OF ALL THE CHESTNUT TREES OF THE
REALM
AS WE HAVE SAID THIS CONVENT OF THE TEMPLE WAS OCCUPIED BY BENEDICTINES
OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION BENEDICTINES QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHO
DEPENDED ON CITEAUX
THIS ORDER OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION IS NOT VERY
ANCIENT AND DOES NOT GO BACK MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS
IN 1649 THE
HOLY SACRAMENT WAS PROFANED ON TWO OCCASIONS A FEW DAYS APART IN TWO
CHURCHES IN PARIS AT SAINT SULPICE AND AT SAINT JEAN EN GREVE A RARE
AND FRIGHTFUL SACRILEGE WHICH SET THE WHOLE TOWN IN AN UPROAR
M
THE
PRIOR AND VICAR GENERAL OF SAINT GERMAIN DES PRES ORDERED A SOLEMN
PROCESSION OF ALL HIS CLERGY IN WHICH THE POPE'S NUNCIO OFFICIATED
BUT THIS EXPIATION DID NOT SATISFY TWO SAINTED WOMEN MADAME COURTIN
MARQUISE DE BOUCS AND THE COMTESSE DE CHATEAUVIEUX
THIS OUTRAGE
COMMITTED ON THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR THOUGH BUT
TEMPORARY WOULD NOT DEPART FROM THESE HOLY SOULS AND IT SEEMED TO
THEM THAT IT COULD ONLY BE EXTENUATED BY A PERPETUAL ADORATION IN SOME
FEMALE MONASTERY
BOTH OF THEM ONE IN 1652 THE OTHER IN 1653 MADE
DONATIONS OF NOTABLE SUMS TO MOTHER CATHERINE DE BAR CALLED OF THE HOLY
SACRAMENT A BENEDICTINE NUN FOR THE PURPOSE OF FOUNDING TO THIS PIOUS
END A MONASTERY OF THE ORDER OF SAINT BENOIT THE FIRST PERMISSION FOR
THIS FOUNDATION WAS GIVEN TO MOTHER CATHERINE DE BAR BY M
DE METZ ABBE
OF SAINT GERMAIN ON CONDITION THAT NO WOMAN COULD BE RECEIVED UNLESS
SHE CONTRIBUTED THREE HUNDRED LIVRES INCOME WHICH AMOUNTS TO SIX
THOUSAND LIVRES TO THE PRINCIPAL AFTER THE ABBE OF SAINT GERMAIN THE
KING ACCORDED LETTERS PATENT AND ALL THE REST ABBATIAL CHARTER AND
ROYAL LETTERS WAS CONFIRMED IN 1654 BY THE CHAMBER OF ACCOUNTS AND THE
PARLIAMENT
SUCH IS THE ORIGIN OF THE LEGAL CONSECRATION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
BENEDICTINES OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION OF THE HOLY SACRAMENT AT PARIS
THEIR FIRST CONVENT WAS A NEW BUILDING IN THE RUE CASSETTE OUT OF THE
CONTRIBUTIONS OF MESDAMES DE BOUCS AND DE CHATEAUVIEUX
THIS ORDER AS IT WILL BE SEEN WAS NOT TO BE CONFOUNDED WITH
THE BENEDICTINE NUNS OF CITEAUX
IT MOUNTED BACK TO THE ABBE OF
SAINT GERMAIN DES PRES IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THE LADIES OF THE SACRED
HEART GO BACK TO THE GENERAL OF THE JESUITS AND THE SISTERS OF CHARITY
TO THE GENERAL OF THE LAZARISTS
IT WAS ALSO TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE BERNARDINES OF THE PETIT PICPUS
WHOSE INTERIOR WE HAVE JUST SHOWN
IN 1657 POPE ALEXANDER VII
HAD
AUTHORIZED BY A SPECIAL BRIEF THE BERNARDINES OF THE RUE PETIT PICPUS
TO PRACTISE THE PERPETUAL ADORATION LIKE THE BENEDICTINE NUNS OF THE
HOLY SACRAMENT
BUT THE TWO ORDERS REMAINED DISTINCT NONE THE LESS
CHAPTER XI END OF THE PETIT PICPUS
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE RESTORATION THE CONVENT OF THE PETIT PICPUS
WAS IN ITS DECAY THIS FORMS A PART OF THE GENERAL DEATH OF THE ORDER
WHICH AFTER THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HAS BEEN DISAPPEARING LIKE ALL
THE RELIGIOUS ORDERS
CONTEMPLATION IS LIKE PRAYER ONE OF HUMANITY'S
NEEDS BUT LIKE EVERYTHING WHICH THE REVOLUTION TOUCHED IT WILL BE
TRANSFORMED AND FROM BEING HOSTILE TO SOCIAL PROGRESS IT WILL BECOME
FAVORABLE TO IT
THE HOUSE OF THE PETIT PICPUS WAS BECOMING RAPIDLY DEPOPULATED
IN 1840
THE LITTLE CONVENT HAD DISAPPEARED THE SCHOOL HAD DISAPPEARED
THERE
WERE NO LONGER ANY OLD WOMEN NOR YOUNG GIRLS THE FIRST WERE DEAD THE
LATTER HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
VOLAVERUNT
THE RULE OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION IS SO RIGID IN ITS NATURE THAT IT
ALARMS VOCATIONS RECOIL BEFORE IT THE ORDER RECEIVES NO RECRUITS
IN
1845 IT STILL OBTAINED LAY SISTERS HERE AND THERE
BUT OF PROFESSED
NUNS NONE AT ALL
FORTY YEARS AGO THE NUNS NUMBERED NEARLY A HUNDRED
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THERE WERE NOT MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM
HOW
MANY ARE THERE TO DAY IN 1847 THE PRIORESS WAS YOUNG A SIGN THAT
THE CIRCLE OF CHOICE WAS RESTRICTED
SHE WAS NOT FORTY YEARS OLD
IN
PROPORTION AS THE NUMBER DIMINISHES THE FATIGUE INCREASES THE SERVICE
OF EACH BECOMES MORE PAINFUL THE MOMENT COULD THEN BE SEEN DRAWING NEAR
WHEN THERE WOULD BE BUT A DOZEN BENT AND ACHING SHOULDERS TO BEAR THE
HEAVY RULE OF SAINT BENOIT
THE BURDEN IS IMPLACABLE AND REMAINS THE
SAME FOR THE FEW AS FOR THE MANY
IT WEIGHS DOWN IT CRUSHES
THUS THEY
DIE
AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK STILL LIVED IN PARIS
TWO DIED
ONE WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD THE OTHER TWENTY THREE
THIS
LATTER CAN SAY LIKE JULIA ALPINULA HIC JACEO
VIXI ANNOS VIGINTI ET
TRES IT IS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS DECAY THAT THE CONVENT GAVE UP THE
EDUCATION OF GIRLS
WE HAVE NOT FELT ABLE TO PASS BEFORE THIS EXTRAORDINARY HOUSE WITHOUT
ENTERING IT AND WITHOUT INTRODUCING THE MINDS WHICH ACCOMPANY US AND
WHICH ARE LISTENING TO OUR TALE TO THE PROFIT OF SOME PERCHANCE OF
THE MELANCHOLY HISTORY OF JEAN VALJEAN
WE HAVE PENETRATED INTO THIS
COMMUNITY FULL OF THOSE OLD PRACTICES WHICH SEEM SO NOVEL TO DAY
IT
IS THE CLOSED GARDEN HORTUS CONCLUSUS
WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THIS SINGULAR
PLACE IN DETAIL BUT WITH RESPECT IN SO FAR AT LEAST AS DETAIL AND
RESPECT ARE COMPATIBLE
WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND ALL BUT WE INSULT NOTHING
WE ARE EQUALLY FAR REMOVED FROM THE HOSANNA OF JOSEPH DE MAISTRE WHO
WOUND UP BY ANOINTING THE EXECUTIONER AND FROM THE SNEER OF VOLTAIRE
WHO EVEN GOES SO FAR AS TO RIDICULE THE CROSS
AN ILLOGICAL ACT ON VOLTAIRE'S PART WE MAY REMARK BY THE WAY FOR
VOLTAIRE WOULD HAVE DEFENDED JESUS AS HE DEFENDED CALAS AND EVEN
FOR THOSE WHO DENY SUPERHUMAN INCARNATIONS WHAT DOES THE CRUCIFIX
REPRESENT THE ASSASSINATED SAGE
IN THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY THE RELIGIOUS IDEA IS UNDERGOING A CRISIS
PEOPLE ARE UNLEARNING CERTAIN THINGS AND THEY DO WELL PROVIDED THAT
WHILE UNLEARNING THEM THEY LEARN THIS THERE IS NO VACUUM IN THE HUMAN
HEART
CERTAIN DEMOLITIONS TAKE PLACE AND IT IS WELL THAT THEY DO BUT
ON CONDITION THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWED BY RECONSTRUCTIONS
IN THE MEANTIME LET US STUDY THINGS WHICH ARE NO MORE
IT IS NECESSARY
TO KNOW THEM IF ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING THEM
THE COUNTERFEITS
OF THE PAST ASSUME FALSE NAMES AND GLADLY CALL THEMSELVES THE FUTURE
THIS SPECTRE THIS PAST IS GIVEN TO FALSIFYING ITS OWN PASSPORT
LET
US INFORM OURSELVES OF THE TRAP
LET US BE ON OUR GUARD
THE PAST HAS A
VISAGE SUPERSTITION AND A MASK HYPOCRISY
LET US DENOUNCE THE VISAGE
AND LET US TEAR OFF THE MASK
AS FOR CONVENTS THEY PRESENT A COMPLEX PROBLEM A QUESTION OF
CIVILIZATION WHICH CONDEMNS THEM A QUESTION OF LIBERTY WHICH PROTECTS
THEM
BOOK SEVENTH PARENTHESIS
CHAPTER I THE CONVENT AS AN ABSTRACT IDEA
THIS BOOK IS A DRAMA WHOSE LEADING PERSONAGE IS THE INFINITE
MAN IS THE SECOND
SUCH BEING THE CASE AND A CONVENT HAVING HAPPENED TO BE ON OUR ROAD IT
HAS BEEN OUR DUTY TO ENTER IT
WHY BECAUSE THE CONVENT WHICH IS COMMON
TO THE ORIENT AS WELL AS TO THE OCCIDENT TO ANTIQUITY AS WELL AS TO
MODERN TIMES TO PAGANISM TO BUDDHISM TO MAHOMETANISM AS WELL AS TO
CHRISTIANITY IS ONE OF THE OPTICAL APPARATUSES APPLIED BY MAN TO THE
INFINITE
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR ENLARGING DISPROPORTIONATELY ON CERTAIN
IDEAS NEVERTHELESS WHILE ABSOLUTELY MAINTAINING OUR RESERVES OUR
RESTRICTIONS AND EVEN OUR INDIGNATIONS WE MUST SAY THAT EVERY TIME WE
ENCOUNTER MAN IN THE INFINITE EITHER WELL OR ILL UNDERSTOOD WE FEEL
OURSELVES OVERPOWERED WITH RESPECT
THERE IS IN THE SYNAGOGUE IN THE
MOSQUE IN THE PAGODA IN THE WIGWAM A HIDEOUS SIDE WHICH WE EXECRATE
AND A SUBLIME SIDE WHICH WE ADORE
WHAT A CONTEMPLATION FOR THE MIND
AND WHAT ENDLESS FOOD FOR THOUGHT IS THE REVERBERATION OF GOD UPON THE
HUMAN WALL
CHAPTER II THE CONVENT AS AN HISTORICAL FACT
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF HISTORY OF REASON AND OF TRUTH MONASTICISM
IS CONDEMNED
MONASTERIES WHEN THEY ABOUND IN A NATION ARE CLOGS IN
ITS CIRCULATION CUMBROUS ESTABLISHMENTS CENTRES OF IDLENESS WHERE
CENTRES OF LABOR SHOULD EXIST
MONASTIC COMMUNITIES ARE TO THE GREAT
SOCIAL COMMUNITY WHAT THE MISTLETOE IS TO THE OAK WHAT THE WART IS
TO THE HUMAN BODY
THEIR PROSPERITY AND THEIR FATNESS MEAN THE
IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE COUNTRY
THE MONASTIC REGIME GOOD AT THE
BEGINNING OF CIVILIZATION USEFUL IN THE REDUCTION OF THE BRUTAL BY THE
SPIRITUAL IS BAD WHEN PEOPLES HAVE REACHED THEIR MANHOOD
MOREOVER
WHEN IT BECOMES RELAXED AND WHEN IT ENTERS INTO ITS PERIOD OF DISORDER
IT BECOMES BAD FOR THE VERY REASONS WHICH RENDERED IT SALUTARY IN ITS
PERIOD OF PURITY BECAUSE IT STILL CONTINUES TO SET THE EXAMPLE
CLAUSTRATION HAS HAD ITS DAY
CLOISTERS USEFUL IN THE EARLY EDUCATION
OF MODERN CIVILIZATION HAVE EMBARRASSED ITS GROWTH AND ARE INJURIOUS
TO ITS DEVELOPMENT
SO FAR AS INSTITUTION AND FORMATION WITH RELATION
TO MAN ARE CONCERNED MONASTERIES WHICH WERE GOOD IN THE TENTH CENTURY
QUESTIONABLE IN THE FIFTEENTH ARE DETESTABLE IN THE NINETEENTH
THE
LEPROSY OF MONASTICISM HAS GNAWED NEARLY TO A SKELETON TWO WONDERFUL
NATIONS ITALY AND SPAIN THE ONE THE LIGHT THE OTHER THE SPLENDOR OF
EUROPE FOR CENTURIES AND AT THE PRESENT DAY THESE TWO ILLUSTRIOUS
PEOPLES ARE BUT JUST BEGINNING TO CONVALESCE THANKS TO THE HEALTHY AND
VIGOROUS HYGIENE OF 1789 ALONE
THE CONVENT THE ANCIENT FEMALE CONVENT IN PARTICULAR SUCH AS IT STILL
PRESENTS ITSELF ON THE THRESHOLD OF THIS CENTURY IN ITALY IN AUSTRIA
IN SPAIN IS ONE OF THE MOST SOMBRE CONCRETIONS OF THE MIDDLE AGES
THE
CLOISTER THAT CLOISTER IS THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF HORRORS
THE
CATHOLIC CLOISTER PROPERLY SPEAKING IS WHOLLY FILLED WITH THE BLACK
RADIANCE OF DEATH
THE SPANISH CONVENT IS THE MOST FUNEREAL OF ALL
THERE RISE IN
OBSCURITY BENEATH VAULTS FILLED WITH GLOOM BENEATH DOMES VAGUE WITH
SHADOW MASSIVE ALTARS OF BABEL AS HIGH AS CATHEDRALS THERE IMMENSE
WHITE CRUCIFIXES HANG FROM CHAINS IN THE DARK THERE ARE EXTENDED ALL
NUDE ON THE EBONY GREAT CHRISTS OF IVORY MORE THAN BLEEDING BLOODY
HIDEOUS AND MAGNIFICENT WITH THEIR ELBOWS DISPLAYING THE BONES THEIR
KNEE PANS SHOWING THEIR INTEGUMENTS THEIR WOUNDS SHOWING THEIR FLESH
CROWNED WITH SILVER THORNS NAILED WITH NAILS OF GOLD WITH BLOOD DROPS
OF RUBIES ON THEIR BROWS AND DIAMOND TEARS IN THEIR EYES
THE DIAMONDS
AND RUBIES SEEM WET AND MAKE VEILED BEINGS IN THE SHADOW BELOW WEEP
THEIR SIDES BRUISED WITH THE HAIR SHIRT AND THEIR IRON TIPPED SCOURGES
THEIR BREASTS CRUSHED WITH WICKER HURDLES THEIR KNEES EXCORIATED WITH
PRAYER WOMEN WHO THINK THEMSELVES WIVES SPECTRES WHO THINK THEMSELVES
SERAPHIM
DO THESE WOMEN THINK NO
HAVE THEY ANY WILL NO
DO THEY
LOVE NO
DO THEY LIVE NO
THEIR NERVES HAVE TURNED TO BONE THEIR
BONES HAVE TURNED TO STONE
THEIR VEIL IS OF WOVEN NIGHT
THEIR BREATH
UNDER THEIR VEIL RESEMBLES THE INDESCRIBABLY TRAGIC RESPIRATION OF
DEATH
THE ABBESS A SPECTRE SANCTIFIES THEM AND TERRIFIES THEM
THE IMMACULATE ONE IS THERE AND VERY FIERCE
SUCH ARE THE ANCIENT
MONASTERIES OF SPAIN
LAIRS OF TERRIBLE DEVOTION CAVERNS OF VIRGINS
FEROCIOUS PLACES
CATHOLIC SPAIN IS MORE ROMAN THAN ROME HERSELF
THE SPANISH CONVENT WAS
ABOVE ALL OTHERS THE CATHOLIC CONVENT
THERE WAS A FLAVOR OF THE ORIENT
ABOUT IT
THE ARCHBISHOP THE KISLAR AGA OF HEAVEN LOCKED UP AND KEPT
WATCH OVER THIS SERAGLIO OF SOULS RESERVED FOR GOD
THE NUN WAS THE
ODALISQUE THE PRIEST WAS THE EUNUCH
THE FERVENT WERE CHOSEN IN DREAMS
AND POSSESSED CHRIST
AT NIGHT THE BEAUTIFUL NUDE YOUNG MAN DESCENDED
FROM THE CROSS AND BECAME THE ECSTASY OF THE CLOISTERED ONE
LOFTY WALLS
GUARDED THE MYSTIC SULTANA WHO HAD THE CRUCIFIED FOR HER SULTAN FROM
ALL LIVING DISTRACTION
A GLANCE ON THE OUTER WORLD WAS INFIDELITY
THE
IN PACE REPLACED THE LEATHER SACK
THAT WHICH WAS CAST INTO THE SEA IN
THE EAST WAS THROWN INTO THE GROUND IN THE WEST
IN BOTH QUARTERS WOMEN
WRUNG THEIR HANDS THE WAVES FOR THE FIRST THE GRAVE FOR THE LAST HERE
THE DROWNED THERE THE BURIED
MONSTROUS PARALLEL
TO DAY THE UPHOLDERS OF THE PAST UNABLE TO DENY THESE THINGS HAVE
ADOPTED THE EXPEDIENT OF SMILING AT THEM
THERE HAS COME INTO FASHION
A STRANGE AND EASY MANNER OF SUPPRESSING THE REVELATIONS OF HISTORY OF
INVALIDATING THE COMMENTARIES OF PHILOSOPHY OF ELIDING ALL EMBARRASSING
FACTS AND ALL GLOOMY QUESTIONS
A MATTER FOR DECLAMATIONS SAY THE
CLEVER
DECLAMATIONS REPEAT THE FOOLISH
JEAN JACQUES A DECLAIMER
DIDEROT A DECLAIMER VOLTAIRE ON CALAS LABARRE AND SIRVEN DECLAIMERS
I KNOW NOT WHO HAS RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT TACITUS WAS A DECLAIMER
THAT NERO WAS A VICTIM AND THAT PITY IS DECIDEDLY DUE TO THAT POOR
HOLOFERNES
FACTS HOWEVER ARE AWKWARD THINGS TO DISCONCERT AND THEY ARE
OBSTINATE
THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK HAS SEEN WITH HIS OWN EYES EIGHT
LEAGUES DISTANT FROM BRUSSELS THERE ARE RELICS OF THE MIDDLE AGES
THERE WHICH ARE ATTAINABLE FOR EVERYBODY AT THE ABBEY OF VILLERS THE
HOLE OF THE OUBLIETTES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS FORMERLY
THE COURTYARD OF THE CLOISTER AND ON THE BANKS OF THE THIL FOUR STONE
DUNGEONS HALF UNDER GROUND HALF UNDER THE WATER
THEY WERE IN PACE
EACH OF THESE DUNGEONS HAS THE REMAINS OF AN IRON DOOR A VAULT AND A
GRATED OPENING WHICH ON THE OUTSIDE IS TWO FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE
RIVER AND ON THE INSIDE SIX FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE GROUND
FOUR
FEET OF RIVER FLOW PAST ALONG THE OUTSIDE WALL
THE GROUND IS ALWAYS
SOAKED
THE OCCUPANT OF THE IN PACE HAD THIS WET SOIL FOR HIS BED
IN
ONE OF THESE DUNGEONS THERE IS A FRAGMENT OF AN IRON NECKLET RIVETED TO
THE WALL IN ANOTHER THERE CAN BE SEEN A SQUARE BOX MADE OF FOUR SLABS
OF GRANITE TOO SHORT FOR A PERSON TO LIE DOWN IN TOO LOW FOR HIM TO
STAND UPRIGHT IN
A HUMAN BEING WAS PUT INSIDE WITH A COVERLID OF STONE
ON TOP
THIS EXISTS
IT CAN BE SEEN
IT CAN BE TOUCHED
THESE IN PACE
THESE DUNGEONS THESE IRON HINGES THESE NECKLETS THAT LOFTY PEEP HOLE
ON A LEVEL WITH THE RIVER'S CURRENT THAT BOX OF STONE CLOSED WITH A LID
OF GRANITE LIKE A TOMB WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT THE DEAD MAN HERE
WAS A LIVING BEING THAT SOIL WHICH IS BUT MUD THAT VAULT HOLE THOSE
OOZING WALLS WHAT DECLAIMERS
CHAPTER III ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RESPECT THE PAST
MONASTICISM SUCH AS IT EXISTED IN SPAIN AND SUCH AS IT STILL EXISTS IN
THIBET IS A SORT OF PHTHISIS FOR CIVILIZATION
IT STOPS LIFE SHORT
IT
SIMPLY DEPOPULATES
CLAUSTRATION CASTRATION
IT HAS BEEN THE SCOURGE
OF EUROPE
ADD TO THIS THE VIOLENCE SO OFTEN DONE TO THE CONSCIENCE THE
FORCED VOCATIONS FEUDALISM BOLSTERED UP BY THE CLOISTER THE RIGHT OF
THE FIRST BORN POURING THE EXCESS OF THE FAMILY INTO MONASTICISM THE
FEROCITIES OF WHICH WE HAVE JUST SPOKEN THE IN PACE THE CLOSED MOUTHS
THE WALLED UP BRAINS SO MANY UNFORTUNATE MINDS PLACED IN THE DUNGEON
OF ETERNAL VOWS THE TAKING OF THE HABIT THE INTERMENT OF LIVING SOULS
ADD INDIVIDUAL TORTURES TO NATIONAL DEGRADATIONS AND WHOEVER YOU
MAY BE YOU WILL SHUDDER BEFORE THE FROCK AND THE VEIL THOSE TWO
WINDING SHEETS OF HUMAN DEVISING
NEVERTHELESS AT CERTAIN POINTS AND IN
CERTAIN PLACES IN SPITE OF PHILOSOPHY IN SPITE OF PROGRESS THE SPIRIT
OF THE CLOISTER PERSISTS IN THE MIDST OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND
A SINGULAR ASCETIC RECRUDESCENCE IS AT THIS MOMENT ASTONISHING
THE CIVILIZED WORLD
THE OBSTINACY OF ANTIQUATED INSTITUTIONS IN
PERPETUATING THEMSELVES RESEMBLES THE STUBBORNNESS OF THE RANCID PERFUME
WHICH SHOULD CLAIM OUR HAIR THE PRETENSIONS OF THE SPOILED FISH WHICH
SHOULD PERSIST IN BEING EATEN THE PERSECUTION OF THE CHILD'S GARMENT
WHICH SHOULD INSIST ON CLOTHING THE MAN THE TENDERNESS OF CORPSES WHICH
SHOULD RETURN TO EMBRACE THE LIVING
INGRATES SAYS THE GARMENT I PROTECTED YOU IN INCLEMENT WEATHER
WHY
WILL YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ME I HAVE JUST COME FROM THE DEEP
SEA SAYS THE FISH
I HAVE BEEN A ROSE SAYS THE PERFUME
I HAVE
LOVED YOU SAYS THE CORPSE
I HAVE CIVILIZED YOU SAYS THE CONVENT
TO THIS THERE IS BUT ONE REPLY IN FORMER DAYS
TO DREAM OF THE INDEFINITE PROLONGATION OF DEFUNCT THINGS AND OF THE
GOVERNMENT OF MEN BY EMBALMING TO RESTORE DOGMAS IN A BAD CONDITION
TO REGILD SHRINES TO PATCH UP CLOISTERS TO REBLESS RELIQUARIES TO
REFURNISH SUPERSTITIONS TO REVICTUAL FANATICISMS TO PUT NEW HANDLES
ON HOLY WATER BRUSHES AND MILITARISM TO RECONSTITUTE MONASTICISM AND
MILITARISM TO BELIEVE IN THE SALVATION OF SOCIETY BY THE MULTIPLICATION
OF PARASITES TO FORCE THE PAST ON THE PRESENT THIS SEEMS STRANGE
STILL THERE ARE THEORISTS WHO HOLD SUCH THEORIES
THESE THEORISTS
WHO ARE IN OTHER RESPECTS PEOPLE OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE A VERY SIMPLE
PROCESS THEY APPLY TO THE PAST A GLAZING WHICH THEY CALL SOCIAL
ORDER DIVINE RIGHT MORALITY FAMILY THE RESPECT OF ELDERS ANTIQUE
AUTHORITY SACRED TRADITION LEGITIMACY RELIGION AND THEY GO ABOUT
SHOUTING LOOK TAKE THIS HONEST PEOPLE THIS LOGIC WAS KNOWN TO THE
ANCIENTS
THE SOOTHSAYERS PRACTISE IT
THEY RUBBED A BLACK HEIFER OVER
WITH CHALK AND SAID SHE IS WHITE BOS CRETATUS
AS FOR US WE RESPECT THE PAST HERE AND THERE AND WE SPARE IT ABOVE
ALL PROVIDED THAT IT CONSENTS TO BE DEAD
IF IT INSISTS ON BEING ALIVE
WE ATTACK IT AND WE TRY TO KILL IT
SUPERSTITIONS BIGOTRIES AFFECTED DEVOTION PREJUDICES THOSE FORMS ALL
FORMS AS THEY ARE ARE TENACIOUS OF LIFE THEY HAVE TEETH AND NAILS IN
THEIR SMOKE AND THEY MUST BE CLASPED CLOSE BODY TO BODY AND WAR MUST
BE MADE ON THEM AND THAT WITHOUT TRUCE FOR IT IS ONE OF THE FATALITIES
OF HUMANITY TO BE CONDEMNED TO ETERNAL COMBAT WITH PHANTOMS
IT IS
DIFFICULT TO SEIZE DARKNESS BY THE THROAT AND TO HURL IT TO THE EARTH
A CONVENT IN FRANCE IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS
A COLLEGE OF OWLS FACING THE LIGHT
A CLOISTER CAUGHT IN THE VERY ACT
OF ASCETICISM IN THE VERY HEART OF THE CITY OF '89 AND OF 1830 AND
OF 1848 ROME BLOSSOMING OUT IN PARIS IS AN ANACHRONISM
IN ORDINARY
TIMES IN ORDER TO DISSOLVE AN ANACHRONISM AND TO CAUSE IT TO VANISH
ONE HAS ONLY TO MAKE IT SPELL OUT THE DATE
BUT WE ARE NOT IN ORDINARY
TIMES
LET US FIGHT
LET US FIGHT BUT LET US MAKE A DISTINCTION
THE PECULIAR PROPERTY OF
TRUTH IS NEVER TO COMMIT EXCESSES
WHAT NEED HAS IT OF EXAGGERATION
THERE IS THAT WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO DESTROY AND THERE IS THAT WHICH
IT IS SIMPLY NECESSARY TO ELUCIDATE AND EXAMINE
WHAT A FORCE IS KINDLY
AND SERIOUS EXAMINATION LET US NOT APPLY A FLAME WHERE ONLY A LIGHT IS
REQUIRED
SO GIVEN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WE ARE OPPOSED AS A GENERAL
PROPOSITION AND AMONG ALL PEOPLES IN ASIA AS WELL AS IN EUROPE
IN INDIA AS WELL AS IN TURKEY TO ASCETIC CLAUSTRATION
WHOEVER SAYS
CLOISTER SAYS MARSH
THEIR PUTRESCENCE IS EVIDENT THEIR STAGNATION IS
UNHEALTHY THEIR FERMENTATION INFECTS PEOPLE WITH FEVER AND ETIOLATES
THEM THEIR MULTIPLICATION BECOMES A PLAGUE OF EGYPT
WE CANNOT THINK
WITHOUT AFFRIGHT OF THOSE LANDS WHERE FAKIRS BONZES SANTONS GREEK
MONKS MARABOUTS TALAPOINS AND DERVISHES MULTIPLY EVEN LIKE SWARMS OF
VERMIN
THIS SAID THE RELIGIOUS QUESTION REMAINS
THIS QUESTION HAS CERTAIN
MYSTERIOUS ALMOST FORMIDABLE SIDES MAY WE BE PERMITTED TO LOOK AT IT
FIXEDLY
CHAPTER IV THE CONVENT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PRINCIPLES
MEN UNITE THEMSELVES AND DWELL IN COMMUNITIES
BY VIRTUE OF WHAT RIGHT
BY VIRTUE OF THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION
THEY SHUT THEMSELVES UP AT HOME
BY VIRTUE OF WHAT RIGHT BY VIRTUE OF
THE RIGHT WHICH EVERY MAN HAS TO OPEN OR SHUT HIS DOOR
THEY DO NOT COME FORTH
BY VIRTUE OF WHAT RIGHT BY VIRTUE OF THE RIGHT
TO GO AND COME WHICH IMPLIES THE RIGHT TO REMAIN AT HOME
THERE AT HOME WHAT DO THEY DO
THEY SPEAK IN LOW TONES THEY DROP THEIR EYES THEY TOIL
THEY RENOUNCE
THE WORLD TOWNS SENSUALITIES PLEASURES VANITIES PRIDE INTERESTS
THEY ARE CLOTHED IN COARSE WOOLLEN OR COARSE LINEN
NOT ONE OF THEM
POSSESSES IN HIS OWN RIGHT ANYTHING WHATEVER
ON ENTERING THERE EACH
ONE WHO WAS RICH MAKES HIMSELF POOR
WHAT HE HAS HE GIVES TO ALL
HE
WHO WAS WHAT IS CALLED NOBLE A GENTLEMAN AND A LORD IS THE EQUAL OF
HIM WHO WAS A PEASANT
THE CELL IS IDENTICAL FOR ALL
ALL UNDERGO THE
SAME TONSURE WEAR THE SAME FROCK EAT THE SAME BLACK BREAD SLEEP ON
THE SAME STRAW DIE ON THE SAME ASHES
THE SAME SACK ON THEIR BACKS THE
SAME ROPE AROUND THEIR LOINS
IF THE DECISION HAS BEEN TO GO BAREFOOT
ALL GO BAREFOOT
THERE MAY BE A PRINCE AMONG THEM THAT PRINCE IS THE
SAME SHADOW AS THE REST
NO TITLES
EVEN FAMILY NAMES HAVE DISAPPEARED
THEY BEAR ONLY FIRST NAMES
ALL ARE BOWED BENEATH THE EQUALITY OF
BAPTISMAL NAMES
THEY HAVE DISSOLVED THE CARNAL FAMILY AND CONSTITUTED
IN THEIR COMMUNITY A SPIRITUAL FAMILY
THEY HAVE NO OTHER RELATIVES THAN
ALL MEN
THEY SUCCOR THE POOR THEY CARE FOR THE SICK
THEY ELECT THOSE
WHOM THEY OBEY
THEY CALL EACH OTHER MY BROTHER
YOU STOP ME AND EXCLAIM BUT THAT IS THE IDEAL CONVENT
IT IS SUFFICIENT THAT IT MAY BE THE POSSIBLE CONVENT THAT I SHOULD TAKE
NOTICE OF IT
THENCE IT RESULTS THAT IN THE PRECEDING BOOK I HAVE SPOKEN OF A
CONVENT WITH RESPECTFUL ACCENTS
THE MIDDLE AGES CAST ASIDE ASIA CAST
ASIDE THE HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL QUESTION HELD IN RESERVE FROM THE
PURELY PHILOSOPHICAL POINT OF VIEW OUTSIDE THE REQUIREMENTS OF MILITANT
POLICY ON CONDITION THAT THE MONASTERY SHALL BE ABSOLUTELY A VOLUNTARY
MATTER AND SHALL CONTAIN ONLY CONSENTING PARTIES I SHALL ALWAYS
CONSIDER A CLOISTERED COMMUNITY WITH A CERTAIN ATTENTIVE AND IN SOME
RESPECTS A DEFERENTIAL GRAVITY
WHEREVER THERE IS A COMMUNITY THERE IS A COMMUNE WHERE THERE IS A
COMMUNE THERE IS RIGHT
THE MONASTERY IS THE PRODUCT OF THE FORMULA
EQUALITY FRATERNITY
OH HOW GRAND IS LIBERTY AND WHAT A SPLENDID
TRANSFIGURATION LIBERTY SUFFICES TO TRANSFORM THE MONASTERY INTO A
REPUBLIC
LET US CONTINUE
BUT THESE MEN OR THESE WOMEN WHO ARE BEHIND THESE FOUR WALLS
THEY
DRESS THEMSELVES IN COARSE WOOLLEN THEY ARE EQUALS THEY CALL EACH
OTHER BROTHERS THAT IS WELL BUT THEY DO SOMETHING ELSE
YES
WHAT
THEY GAZE ON THE DARKNESS THEY KNEEL AND THEY CLASP THEIR HANDS
WHAT DOES THIS SIGNIFY
CHAPTER V PRAYER
THEY PRAY
TO WHOM
TO GOD
TO PRAY TO GOD WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THESE WORDS
IS THERE AN INFINITE BEYOND US IS THAT INFINITE THERE INHERENT
PERMANENT NECESSARILY SUBSTANTIAL SINCE IT IS INFINITE AND BECAUSE
IF IT LACKED MATTER IT WOULD BE BOUNDED NECESSARILY INTELLIGENT SINCE
IT IS INFINITE AND BECAUSE IF IT LACKED INTELLIGENCE IT WOULD END
THERE DOES THIS INFINITE AWAKEN IN US THE IDEA OF ESSENCE WHILE WE CAN
ATTRIBUTE TO OURSELVES ONLY THE IDEA OF EXISTENCE IN OTHER TERMS IS IT
NOT THE ABSOLUTE OF WHICH WE ARE ONLY THE RELATIVE
AT THE SAME TIME THAT THERE IS AN INFINITE WITHOUT US IS THERE NOT
AN INFINITE WITHIN US ARE NOT THESE TWO INFINITES WHAT AN ALARMING
PLURAL SUPERPOSED THE ONE UPON THE OTHER IS NOT THIS SECOND
INFINITE SO TO SPEAK SUBJACENT TO THE FIRST IS IT NOT THE LATTER'S
MIRROR REFLECTION ECHO AN ABYSS WHICH IS CONCENTRIC WITH ANOTHER
ABYSS IS THIS SECOND INFINITY INTELLIGENT ALSO DOES IT THINK DOES
IT LOVE DOES IT WILL IF THESE TWO INFINITIES ARE INTELLIGENT EACH OF
THEM HAS A WILL PRINCIPLE AND THERE IS AN I IN THE UPPER INFINITY AS
THERE IS AN I IN THE LOWER INFINITY
THE I BELOW IS THE SOUL THE
I ON HIGH IS GOD
TO PLACE THE INFINITY HERE BELOW IN CONTACT BY THE MEDIUM OF THOUGHT
WITH THE INFINITY ON HIGH IS CALLED PRAYING
LET US TAKE NOTHING FROM THE HUMAN MIND TO SUPPRESS IS BAD
WE MUST
REFORM AND TRANSFORM
CERTAIN FACULTIES IN MAN ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS
THE UNKNOWN THOUGHT REVERY PRAYER
THE UNKNOWN IS AN OCEAN
WHAT
IS CONSCIENCE IT IS THE COMPASS OF THE UNKNOWN
THOUGHT REVERY
PRAYER THESE ARE GREAT AND MYSTERIOUS RADIATIONS
LET US RESPECT THEM
WHITHER GO THESE MAJESTIC IRRADIATIONS OF THE SOUL INTO THE SHADOW
THAT IS TO SAY TO THE LIGHT
THE GRANDEUR OF DEMOCRACY IS TO DISOWN NOTHING AND TO DENY NOTHING OF
HUMANITY
CLOSE TO THE RIGHT OF THE MAN BESIDE IT AT THE LEAST THERE
EXISTS THE RIGHT OF THE SOUL
TO CRUSH FANATICISM AND TO VENERATE THE INFINITE SUCH IS THE LAW
LET
US NOT CONFINE OURSELVES TO PROSTRATING OURSELVES BEFORE THE TREE OF
CREATION AND TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF ITS BRANCHES FULL OF STARS
WE
HAVE A DUTY TO LABOR OVER THE HUMAN SOUL TO DEFEND THE MYSTERY AGAINST
THE MIRACLE TO ADORE THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND REJECT THE ABSURD
TO ADMIT AS AN INEXPLICABLE FACT ONLY WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PURIFY
BELIEF TO REMOVE SUPERSTITIONS FROM ABOVE RELIGION TO CLEAR GOD OF
CATERPILLARS
CHAPTER VI THE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF PRAYER
WITH REGARD TO THE MODES OF PRAYER ALL ARE GOOD PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE
SINCERE
TURN YOUR BOOK UPSIDE DOWN AND BE IN THE INFINITE
THERE IS AS WE KNOW A PHILOSOPHY WHICH DENIES THE INFINITE
THERE IS
ALSO A PHILOSOPHY PATHOLOGICALLY CLASSIFIED WHICH DENIES THE SUN THIS
PHILOSOPHY IS CALLED BLINDNESS
TO ERECT A SENSE WHICH WE LACK INTO A SOURCE OF TRUTH IS A FINE BLIND
MAN'S SELF SUFFICIENCY
THE CURIOUS THING IS THE HAUGHTY SUPERIOR AND COMPASSIONATE AIRS WHICH
THIS GROPING PHILOSOPHY ASSUMES TOWARDS THE PHILOSOPHY WHICH BEHOLDS
GOD
ONE FANCIES HE HEARS A MOLE CRYING I PITY THEM WITH THEIR SUN
THERE ARE AS WE KNOW POWERFUL AND ILLUSTRIOUS ATHEISTS
AT BOTTOM LED
BACK TO THE TRUTH BY THEIR VERY FORCE THEY ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT
THEY ARE ATHEISTS IT IS WITH THEM ONLY A QUESTION OF DEFINITION AND IN
ANY CASE IF THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN GOD BEING GREAT MINDS THEY PROVE
GOD
WE SALUTE THEM AS PHILOSOPHERS WHILE INEXORABLY DENOUNCING THEIR
PHILOSOPHY
LET US GO ON
THE REMARKABLE THING ABOUT IT IS ALSO THEIR FACILITY IN PAYING
THEMSELVES OFF WITH WORDS
A METAPHYSICAL SCHOOL OF THE NORTH
IMPREGNATED TO SOME EXTENT WITH FOG HAS FANCIED THAT IT HAS WORKED A
REVOLUTION IN HUMAN UNDERSTANDING BY REPLACING THE WORD FORCE WITH THE
WORD WILL
TO SAY THE PLANT WILLS INSTEAD OF THE PLANT GROWS THIS WOULD BE
FECUND IN RESULTS INDEED IF WE WERE TO ADD THE UNIVERSE WILLS WHY
BECAUSE IT WOULD COME TO THIS THE PLANT WILLS THEREFORE IT HAS AN I
THE UNIVERSE WILLS THEREFORE IT HAS A GOD
AS FOR US WHO HOWEVER IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THIS SCHOOL REJECT
NOTHING A PRIORI A WILL IN THE PLANT ACCEPTED BY THIS SCHOOL APPEARS
TO US MORE DIFFICULT TO ADMIT THAN A WILL IN THE UNIVERSE DENIED BY IT
TO DENY THE WILL OF THE INFINITE THAT IS TO SAY GOD IS IMPOSSIBLE ON
ANY OTHER CONDITIONS THAN A DENIAL OF THE INFINITE
WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED
THIS
THE NEGATION OF THE INFINITE LEADS STRAIGHT TO NIHILISM
EVERYTHING
BECOMES A MENTAL CONCEPTION
WITH NIHILISM NO DISCUSSION IS POSSIBLE FOR THE NIHILIST LOGIC DOUBTS
THE EXISTENCE OF ITS INTERLOCUTOR AND IS NOT QUITE SURE THAT IT EXISTS
ITSELF
FROM ITS POINT OF VIEW IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY BE FOR ITSELF ONLY
A MENTAL CONCEPTION
ONLY IT DOES NOT PERCEIVE THAT ALL WHICH IT HAS DENIED IT ADMITS IN THE
LUMP SIMPLY BY THE UTTERANCE OF THE WORD MIND
IN SHORT NO WAY IS OPEN TO THE THOUGHT BY A PHILOSOPHY WHICH MAKES ALL
END IN THE MONOSYLLABLE NO
TO NO THERE IS ONLY ONE REPLY YES
NIHILISM HAS NO POINT
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS NOTHINGNESS
ZERO DOES NOT EXIST
EVERYTHING
IS SOMETHING
NOTHING IS NOTHING
MAN LIVES BY AFFIRMATION EVEN MORE THAN BY BREAD
EVEN TO SEE AND TO SHOW DOES NOT SUFFICE
PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE AN
ENERGY IT SHOULD HAVE FOR EFFORT AND EFFECT TO AMELIORATE THE CONDITION
OF MAN
SOCRATES SHOULD ENTER INTO ADAM AND PRODUCE MARCUS AURELIUS IN
OTHER WORDS THE MAN OF WISDOM SHOULD BE MADE TO EMERGE FROM THE MAN
OF FELICITY
EDEN SHOULD BE CHANGED INTO A LYCEUM
SCIENCE SHOULD BE
A CORDIAL
TO ENJOY WHAT A SAD AIM AND WHAT A PALTRY AMBITION THE
BRUTE ENJOYS
TO OFFER THOUGHT TO THE THIRST OF MEN TO GIVE THEM ALL AS
AN ELIXIR THE NOTION OF GOD TO MAKE CONSCIENCE AND SCIENCE FRATERNIZE
IN THEM TO RENDER THEM JUST BY THIS MYSTERIOUS CONFRONTATION SUCH IS
THE FUNCTION OF REAL PHILOSOPHY
MORALITY IS A BLOSSOMING OUT OF TRUTHS
CONTEMPLATION LEADS TO ACTION
THE ABSOLUTE SHOULD BE PRACTICABLE
IT IS
NECESSARY THAT THE IDEAL SHOULD BE BREATHABLE DRINKABLE AND EATABLE TO
THE HUMAN MIND
IT IS THE IDEAL WHICH HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY TAKE THIS
IT IS ON THIS CONDITION THAT IT CEASES TO BE A STERILE LOVE OF SCIENCE
AND BECOMES THE ONE AND SOVEREIGN MODE OF HUMAN RALLYING AND THAT
PHILOSOPHY HERSELF IS PROMOTED TO RELIGION
PHILOSOPHY SHOULD NOT BE A CORBEL ERECTED ON MYSTERY TO GAZE UPON IT
AT ITS EASE WITHOUT ANY OTHER RESULT THAN THAT OF BEING CONVENIENT TO
CURIOSITY
FOR OUR PART ADJOURNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR THOUGHT TO ANOTHER
OCCASION WE WILL CONFINE OURSELVES TO SAYING THAT WE NEITHER UNDERSTAND
MAN AS A POINT OF DEPARTURE NOR PROGRESS AS AN END WITHOUT THOSE TWO
FORCES WHICH ARE THEIR TWO MOTORS FAITH AND LOVE
PROGRESS IS THE GOAL THE IDEAL IS THE TYPE
WHAT IS THIS IDEAL IT IS GOD
IDEAL ABSOLUTE PERFECTION INFINITY IDENTICAL WORDS
CHAPTER VII PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN BLAME
HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY HAVE ETERNAL DUTIES WHICH ARE AT THE SAME TIME
SIMPLE DUTIES TO COMBAT CAIPHAS THE HIGH PRIEST DRACO THE LAWGIVER
TRIMALCION THE LEGISLATOR TIBERIUS THE EMPEROR THIS IS CLEAR DIRECT
AND LIMPID AND OFFERS NO OBSCURITY
BUT THE RIGHT TO LIVE APART EVEN WITH ITS INCONVENIENCES AND ITS
ABUSES INSISTS ON BEING STATED AND TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
CENOBITISM IS A
HUMAN PROBLEM
WHEN ONE SPEAKS OF CONVENTS THOSE ABODES OF ERROR BUT OF INNOCENCE
OF ABERRATION BUT OF GOOD WILL OF IGNORANCE BUT OF DEVOTION OF TORTURE
BUT OF MARTYRDOM IT ALWAYS BECOMES NECESSARY TO SAY EITHER YES OR NO
A CONVENT IS A CONTRADICTION
ITS OBJECT SALVATION ITS MEANS THERETO
SACRIFICE
THE CONVENT IS SUPREME EGOISM HAVING FOR ITS RESULT SUPREME
ABNEGATION
TO ABDICATE WITH THE OBJECT OF REIGNING SEEMS TO BE THE DEVICE OF
MONASTICISM
IN THE CLOISTER ONE SUFFERS IN ORDER TO ENJOY
ONE DRAWS A BILL OF
EXCHANGE ON DEATH
ONE DISCOUNTS IN TERRESTRIAL GLOOM CELESTIAL LIGHT
IN THE CLOISTER HELL IS ACCEPTED IN ADVANCE AS A POST OBIT ON PARADISE
THE TAKING OF THE VEIL OR THE FROCK IS A SUICIDE PAID FOR WITH ETERNITY
IT DOES NOT SEEM TO US THAT ON SUCH A SUBJECT MOCKERY IS PERMISSIBLE
ALL ABOUT IT IS SERIOUS THE GOOD AS WELL AS THE BAD
THE JUST MAN FROWNS BUT NEVER SMILES WITH A MALICIOUS SNEER
WE
UNDERSTAND WRATH BUT NOT MALICE
CHAPTER VIII FAITH LAW
A FEW WORDS MORE
WE BLAME THE CHURCH WHEN SHE IS SATURATED WITH INTRIGUES WE DESPISE THE
SPIRITUAL WHICH IS HARSH TOWARD THE TEMPORAL BUT WE EVERYWHERE HONOR
THE THOUGHTFUL MAN
WE SALUTE THE MAN WHO KNEELS
A FAITH THIS IS A NECESSITY FOR MAN
WOE TO HIM WHO BELIEVES NOTHING
ONE IS NOT UNOCCUPIED BECAUSE ONE IS ABSORBED
THERE IS VISIBLE LABOR
AND INVISIBLE LABOR
TO CONTEMPLATE IS TO LABOR TO THINK IS TO ACT
FOLDED ARMS TOIL CLASPED HANDS WORK
A GAZE FIXED ON HEAVEN IS A WORK
THALES REMAINED MOTIONLESS FOR FOUR YEARS
HE FOUNDED PHILOSOPHY
IN OUR OPINION CENOBITES ARE NOT LAZY MEN AND RECLUSES ARE NOT IDLERS
TO MEDITATE ON THE SHADOW IS A SERIOUS THING
WITHOUT INVALIDATING ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE JUST SAID WE BELIEVE THAT
A PERPETUAL MEMORY OF THE TOMB IS PROPER FOR THE LIVING
ON THIS POINT
THE PRIEST AND THE PHILOSOPHER AGREE
WE MUST DIE
THE ABBE DE LA TRAPPE
REPLIES TO HORACE
TO MINGLE WITH ONE'S LIFE A CERTAIN PRESENCE OF THE SEPULCHRE THIS IS
THE LAW OF THE SAGE AND IT IS THE LAW OF THE ASCETIC
IN THIS RESPECT
THE ASCETIC AND THE SAGE CONVERGE
THERE IS A MATERIAL GROWTH WE
ADMIT IT
THERE IS A MORAL GRANDEUR WE HOLD TO THAT
THOUGHTLESS AND
VIVACIOUS SPIRITS SAY
WHAT IS THE GOOD OF THOSE MOTIONLESS FIGURES ON THE SIDE OF MYSTERY
WHAT PURPOSE DO THEY SERVE WHAT DO THEY DO
ALAS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DARKNESS WHICH ENVIRONS US AND WHICH
AWAITS US IN OUR IGNORANCE OF WHAT THE IMMENSE DISPERSION WILL MAKE OF
US WE REPLY THERE IS PROBABLY NO WORK MORE DIVINE THAN THAT PERFORMED
BY THESE SOULS AND WE ADD THERE IS PROBABLY NO WORK WHICH IS MORE
USEFUL
THERE CERTAINLY MUST BE SOME WHO PRAY CONSTANTLY FOR THOSE WHO NEVER
PRAY AT ALL
IN OUR OPINION THE WHOLE QUESTION LIES IN THE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT THAT IS
MINGLED WITH PRAYER
LEIBNITZ PRAYING IS GRAND VOLTAIRE ADORING IS FINE
DEO EREXIT
VOLTAIRE
WE ARE FOR RELIGION AS AGAINST RELIGIONS
WE ARE OF THE NUMBER WHO BELIEVE IN THE WRETCHEDNESS OF ORISONS AND THE
SUBLIMITY OF PRAYER
MOREOVER AT THIS MINUTE WHICH WE ARE NOW TRAVERSING A MINUTE WHICH
WILL NOT FORTUNATELY LEAVE ITS IMPRESS ON THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AT
THIS HOUR WHEN SO MANY MEN HAVE LOW BROWS AND SOULS BUT LITTLE
ELEVATED AMONG SO MANY MORTALS WHOSE MORALITY CONSISTS IN ENJOYMENT
AND WHO ARE BUSIED WITH THE BRIEF AND MISSHAPEN THINGS OF MATTER
WHOEVER EXILES HIMSELF SEEMS WORTHY OF VENERATION TO US
THE MONASTERY IS A RENUNCIATION
SACRIFICE WRONGLY DIRECTED IS STILL
SACRIFICE
TO MISTAKE A GRAVE ERROR FOR A DUTY HAS A GRANDEUR OF ITS
OWN
TAKEN BY ITSELF AND IDEALLY AND IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE TRUTH ON ALL
SIDES UNTIL ALL ASPECTS HAVE BEEN IMPARTIALLY EXHAUSTED THE MONASTERY
THE FEMALE CONVENT IN PARTICULAR FOR IN OUR CENTURY IT IS WOMAN WHO
SUFFERS THE MOST AND IN THIS EXILE OF THE CLOISTER THERE IS SOMETHING
OF PROTESTATION THE FEMALE CONVENT HAS INCONTESTABLY A CERTAIN
MAJESTY
THIS CLOISTERED EXISTENCE WHICH IS SO AUSTERE SO DEPRESSING A FEW OF
WHOSE FEATURES WE HAVE JUST TRACED IS NOT LIFE FOR IT IS NOT LIBERTY
IT IS NOT THE TOMB FOR IT IS NOT PLENITUDE IT IS THE STRANGE PLACE
WHENCE ONE BEHOLDS AS FROM THE CREST OF A LOFTY MOUNTAIN ON ONE SIDE
THE ABYSS WHERE WE ARE ON THE OTHER THE ABYSS WHITHER WE SHALL GO IT
IS THE NARROW AND MISTY FRONTIER SEPARATING TWO WORLDS ILLUMINATED
AND OBSCURED BY BOTH AT THE SAME TIME WHERE THE RAY OF LIFE WHICH HAS
BECOME ENFEEBLED IS MINGLED WITH THE VAGUE RAY OF DEATH IT IS THE HALF
OBSCURITY OF THE TOMB
WE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT THESE WOMEN BELIEVE BUT WHO LIKE THEM
LIVE BY FAITH WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO THINK WITHOUT A SORT OF
TENDER AND RELIGIOUS TERROR WITHOUT A SORT OF PITY THAT IS FULL OF
ENVY OF THOSE DEVOTED TREMBLING AND TRUSTING CREATURES OF THESE
HUMBLE AND AUGUST SOULS WHO DARE TO DWELL ON THE VERY BRINK OF THE
MYSTERY WAITING BETWEEN THE WORLD WHICH IS CLOSED AND HEAVEN WHICH IS
NOT YET OPEN TURNED TOWARDS THE LIGHT WHICH ONE CANNOT SEE POSSESSING
THE SOLE HAPPINESS OF THINKING THAT THEY KNOW WHERE IT IS ASPIRING
TOWARDS THE GULF AND THE UNKNOWN THEIR EYES FIXED MOTIONLESS ON THE
DARKNESS KNEELING BEWILDERED STUPEFIED SHUDDERING HALF LIFTED AT
TIMES BY THE DEEP BREATHS OF ETERNITY
BOOK EIGHTH CEMETERIES TAKE THAT WHICH IS COMMITTED THEM
CHAPTER I WHICH TREATS OF THE MANNER OF ENTERING A CONVENT
IT WAS INTO THIS HOUSE THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD AS FAUCHELEVENT EXPRESSED
IT FALLEN FROM THE SKY
HE HAD SCALED THE WALL OF THE GARDEN WHICH FORMED THE ANGLE OF THE RUE
POLONCEAU
THAT HYMN OF THE ANGELS WHICH HE HAD HEARD IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT WAS THE NUNS CHANTING MATINS THAT HALL OF WHICH HE HAD
CAUGHT A GLIMPSE IN THE GLOOM WAS THE CHAPEL
THAT PHANTOM WHICH HE HAD
SEEN STRETCHED ON THE GROUND WAS THE SISTER WHO WAS MAKING REPARATION
THAT BELL THE SOUND OF WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY SURPRISED HIM WAS THE
GARDENER'S BELL ATTACHED TO THE KNEE OF FATHER FAUCHELEVENT
COSETTE ONCE PUT TO BED JEAN VALJEAN AND FAUCHELEVENT HAD AS WE HAVE
ALREADY SEEN SUPPED ON A GLASS OF WINE AND A BIT OF CHEESE BEFORE A
GOOD CRACKLING FIRE THEN THE ONLY BED IN THE HUT BEING OCCUPIED BY
COSETTE EACH THREW HIMSELF ON A TRUSS OF STRAW
BEFORE HE SHUT HIS EYES JEAN VALJEAN SAID I MUST REMAIN HERE
HENCEFORTH THIS REMARK TROTTED THROUGH FAUCHELEVENT'S HEAD ALL NIGHT
LONG
TO TELL THE TRUTH NEITHER OF THEM SLEPT
JEAN VALJEAN FEELING THAT HE WAS DISCOVERED AND THAT JAVERT WAS ON
HIS SCENT UNDERSTOOD THAT HE AND COSETTE WERE LOST IF THEY RETURNED TO
PARIS
THEN THE NEW STORM WHICH HAD JUST BURST UPON HIM HAD STRANDED
HIM IN THIS CLOISTER
JEAN VALJEAN HAD HENCEFORTH BUT ONE THOUGHT TO
REMAIN THERE
NOW FOR AN UNFORTUNATE MAN IN HIS POSITION THIS
CONVENT WAS BOTH THE SAFEST AND THE MOST DANGEROUS OF PLACES THE MOST
DANGEROUS BECAUSE AS NO MEN MIGHT ENTER THERE IF HE WERE DISCOVERED
IT WAS A FLAGRANT OFFENCE AND JEAN VALJEAN WOULD FIND BUT ONE STEP
INTERVENING BETWEEN THE CONVENT AND PRISON THE SAFEST BECAUSE IF HE
COULD MANAGE TO GET HIMSELF ACCEPTED THERE AND REMAIN THERE WHO WOULD
EVER SEEK HIM IN SUCH A PLACE TO DWELL IN AN IMPOSSIBLE PLACE WAS
SAFETY
ON HIS SIDE FAUCHELEVENT WAS CUDGELLING HIS BRAINS
HE BEGAN BY
DECLARING TO HIMSELF THAT HE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF THE MATTER
HOW HAD
M
MADELEINE GOT THERE WHEN THE WALLS WERE WHAT THEY WERE CLOISTER
WALLS ARE NOT TO BE STEPPED OVER
HOW DID HE GET THERE WITH A CHILD ONE
CANNOT SCALE A PERPENDICULAR WALL WITH A CHILD IN ONE'S ARMS
WHO WAS
THAT CHILD WHERE DID THEY BOTH COME FROM SINCE FAUCHELEVENT HAD LIVED
IN THE CONVENT HE HAD HEARD NOTHING OF M
SUR M AND HE KNEW NOTHING
OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE THERE
FATHER MADELEINE HAD AN AIR WHICH
DISCOURAGED QUESTIONS AND BESIDES FAUCHELEVENT SAID TO HIMSELF ONE
DOES NOT QUESTION A SAINT M
MADELEINE HAD PRESERVED ALL HIS PRESTIGE
IN FAUCHELEVENT'S EYES
ONLY FROM SOME WORDS WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAD LET
FALL THE GARDENER THOUGHT HE COULD DRAW THE INFERENCE THAT M
MADELEINE
HAD PROBABLY BECOME BANKRUPT THROUGH THE HARD TIMES AND THAT HE WAS
PURSUED BY HIS CREDITORS OR THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED HIMSELF IN SOME
POLITICAL AFFAIR AND WAS IN HIDING WHICH LAST DID NOT DISPLEASE
FAUCHELEVENT WHO LIKE MANY OF OUR PEASANTS OF THE NORTH HAD AN
OLD FUND OF BONAPARTISM ABOUT HIM
WHILE IN HIDING M
MADELEINE HAD
SELECTED THE CONVENT AS A REFUGE AND IT WAS QUITE SIMPLE THAT HE SHOULD
WISH TO REMAIN THERE
BUT THE INEXPLICABLE POINT TO WHICH FAUCHELEVENT
RETURNED CONSTANTLY AND OVER WHICH HE WEARIED HIS BRAIN WAS THAT M
MADELEINE SHOULD BE THERE AND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THAT LITTLE GIRL WITH
HIM
FAUCHELEVENT SAW THEM TOUCHED THEM SPOKE TO THEM AND STILL DID
NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE
THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE HAD JUST MADE ITS ENTRANCE
INTO FAUCHELEVENT'S HUT
FAUCHELEVENT GROPED ABOUT AMID CONJECTURES AND
COULD SEE NOTHING CLEARLY BUT THIS M
MADELEINE SAVED MY LIFE
THIS CERTAINTY ALONE WAS SUFFICIENT AND DECIDED HIS COURSE
HE SAID TO
HIMSELF IT IS MY TURN NOW HE ADDED IN HIS CONSCIENCE M
MADELEINE
DID NOT STOP TO DELIBERATE WHEN IT WAS A QUESTION OF THRUSTING HIMSELF
UNDER THE CART FOR THE PURPOSE OF DRAGGING ME OUT HE MADE UP HIS MIND
TO SAVE M
MADELEINE
NEVERTHELESS HE PUT MANY QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF AND MADE HIMSELF DIVERS
REPLIES AFTER WHAT HE DID FOR ME WOULD I SAVE HIM IF HE WERE A THIEF
JUST THE SAME
IF HE WERE AN ASSASSIN WOULD I SAVE HIM JUST THE SAME
SINCE HE IS A SAINT SHALL I SAVE HIM JUST THE SAME
BUT WHAT A PROBLEM IT WAS TO MANAGE TO HAVE HIM REMAIN IN THE CONVENT
FAUCHELEVENT DID NOT RECOIL IN THE FACE OF THIS ALMOST CHIMERICAL
UNDERTAKING THIS POOR PEASANT OF PICARDY WITHOUT ANY OTHER LADDER
THAN HIS SELF DEVOTION HIS GOOD WILL AND A LITTLE OF THAT OLD
RUSTIC CUNNING ON THIS OCCASION ENLISTED IN THE SERVICE OF A GENEROUS
ENTERPRISE UNDERTOOK TO SCALE THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE CLOISTER AND THE
STEEP ESCARPMENTS OF THE RULE OF SAINT BENOIT
FATHER FAUCHELEVENT WAS
AN OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN AN EGOIST ALL HIS LIFE AND WHO TOWARDS THE END
OF HIS DAYS HALT INFIRM WITH NO INTEREST LEFT TO HIM IN THE WORLD
FOUND IT SWEET TO BE GRATEFUL AND PERCEIVING A GENEROUS ACTION TO BE
PERFORMED FLUNG HIMSELF UPON IT LIKE A MAN WHO AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE
IS DYING SHOULD FIND CLOSE TO HIS HAND A GLASS OF GOOD WINE WHICH HE
HAD NEVER TASTED AND SHOULD SWALLOW IT WITH AVIDITY
WE MAY ADD
THAT THE AIR WHICH HE HAD BREATHED FOR MANY YEARS IN THIS CONVENT HAD
DESTROYED ALL PERSONALITY IN HIM AND HAD ENDED BY RENDERING A GOOD
ACTION OF SOME KIND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO HIM
SO HE TOOK HIS RESOLVE TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO M
MADELEINE
WE HAVE JUST CALLED HIM A POOR PEASANT OF PICARDY
THAT DESCRIPTION
IS JUST BUT INCOMPLETE
AT THE POINT OF THIS STORY WHICH WE HAVE NOW
REACHED A LITTLE OF FATHER FAUCHELEVENT'S PHYSIOLOGY BECOMES USEFUL
HE WAS A PEASANT BUT HE HAD BEEN A NOTARY WHICH ADDED TRICKERY TO HIS
CUNNING AND PENETRATION TO HIS INGENUOUSNESS
HAVING THROUGH VARIOUS
CAUSES FAILED IN HIS BUSINESS HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE CALLING OF A
CARTER AND A LABORER
BUT IN SPITE OF OATHS AND LASHINGS WHICH HORSES
SEEM TO REQUIRE SOMETHING OF THE NOTARY HAD LINGERED IN HIM
HE HAD
SOME NATURAL WIT HE TALKED GOOD GRAMMAR HE CONVERSED WHICH IS A RARE
THING IN A VILLAGE AND THE OTHER PEASANTS SAID OF HIM HE TALKS ALMOST
LIKE A GENTLEMAN WITH A HAT FAUCHELEVENT BELONGED IN FACT TO THAT
SPECIES WHICH THE IMPERTINENT AND FLIPPANT VOCABULARY OF THE LAST
CENTURY QUALIFIED AS DEMI BOURGEOIS DEMI LOUT AND WHICH THE METAPHORS
SHOWERED BY THE CHATEAU UPON THE THATCHED COTTAGE TICKETED IN THE
PIGEON HOLE OF THE PLEBEIAN RATHER RUSTIC RATHER CITIFIED PEPPER AND
SALT
FAUCHELEVENT THOUGH SORELY TRIED AND HARSHLY USED BY FATE
WORN OUT A SORT OF POOR THREADBARE OLD SOUL WAS NEVERTHELESS AN
IMPULSIVE MAN AND EXTREMELY SPONTANEOUS IN HIS ACTIONS A PRECIOUS
QUALITY WHICH PREVENTS ONE FROM EVER BEING WICKED
HIS DEFECTS AND HIS
VICES FOR HE HAD SOME WERE ALL SUPERFICIAL IN SHORT HIS PHYSIOGNOMY
WAS OF THE KIND WHICH SUCCEEDS WITH AN OBSERVER
HIS AGED FACE HAD NONE
OF THOSE DISAGREEABLE WRINKLES AT THE TOP OF THE FOREHEAD WHICH SIGNIFY
MALICE OR STUPIDITY
AT DAYBREAK FATHER FAUCHELEVENT OPENED HIS EYES AFTER HAVING DONE AN
ENORMOUS DEAL OF THINKING AND BEHELD M
MADELEINE SEATED ON HIS TRUSS
OF STRAW AND WATCHING COSETTE'S SLUMBERS
FAUCHELEVENT SAT UP AND
SAID
NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CONTRIVE TO ENTER
THIS REMARK SUMMED UP THE SITUATION AND AROUSED JEAN VALJEAN FROM HIS
REVERY
THE TWO MEN TOOK COUNSEL TOGETHER
IN THE FIRST PLACE SAID FAUCHELEVENT YOU WILL BEGIN BY NOT SETTING
FOOT OUTSIDE OF THIS CHAMBER EITHER YOU OR THE CHILD
ONE STEP IN THE
GARDEN AND WE ARE DONE FOR
THAT IS TRUE
MONSIEUR MADELEINE RESUMED FAUCHELEVENT YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT A VERY
AUSPICIOUS MOMENT I MEAN TO SAY A VERY INAUSPICIOUS MOMENT ONE OF
THE LADIES IS VERY ILL
THIS WILL PREVENT THEM FROM LOOKING MUCH IN OUR
DIRECTION
IT SEEMS THAT SHE IS DYING
THE PRAYERS OF THE FORTY HOURS
ARE BEING SAID
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IS IN CONFUSION
THAT OCCUPIES THEM
THE ONE WHO IS ON THE POINT OF DEPARTURE IS A SAINT
IN FACT WE ARE
ALL SAINTS HERE ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND ME IS THAT THEY SAY
'OUR CELL AND THAT I SAY 'MY CABIN THE PRAYERS FOR THE DYING ARE TO
BE SAID AND THEN THE PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD
WE SHALL BE AT PEACE HERE
FOR TO DAY BUT I WILL NOT ANSWER FOR TO MORROW
STILL OBSERVED JEAN VALJEAN THIS COTTAGE IS IN THE NICHE OF THE
WALL IT IS HIDDEN BY A SORT OF RUIN THERE ARE TREES IT IS NOT VISIBLE
FROM THE CONVENT
AND I ADD THAT THE NUNS NEVER COME NEAR IT
WELL SAID JEAN VALJEAN
THE INTERROGATION MARK WHICH ACCENTUATED THIS WELL SIGNIFIED
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE MAY REMAIN CONCEALED HERE IT WAS TO THIS
INTERROGATION POINT THAT FAUCHELEVENT RESPONDED
THERE ARE THE LITTLE GIRLS
WHAT LITTLE GIRLS ASKED JEAN VALJEAN
JUST AS FAUCHELEVENT OPENED HIS MOUTH TO EXPLAIN THE WORDS WHICH HE HAD
UTTERED A BELL EMITTED ONE STROKE
THE NUN IS DEAD SAID HE
THERE IS THE KNELL
AND HE MADE A SIGN TO JEAN VALJEAN TO LISTEN
THE BELL STRUCK A SECOND TIME
IT IS THE KNELL MONSIEUR MADELEINE
THE BELL WILL CONTINUE TO STRIKE
ONCE A MINUTE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS UNTIL THE BODY IS TAKEN FROM THE
CHURCH YOU SEE THEY PLAY
AT RECREATION HOURS IT SUFFICES TO HAVE A
BALL ROLL ASIDE TO SEND THEM ALL HITHER IN SPITE OF PROHIBITIONS TO
HUNT AND RUMMAGE FOR IT ALL ABOUT HERE
THOSE CHERUBS ARE DEVILS
WHO ASKED JEAN VALJEAN
THE LITTLE GIRLS
YOU WOULD BE VERY QUICKLY DISCOVERED
THEY WOULD
SHRIEK 'OH A MAN THERE IS NO DANGER TO DAY
THERE WILL BE NO
RECREATION HOUR
THE DAY WILL BE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO PRAYERS
YOU HEAR
THE BELL
AS I TOLD YOU A STROKE EACH MINUTE
IT IS THE DEATH KNELL
I UNDERSTAND FATHER FAUCHELEVENT
THERE ARE PUPILS
AND JEAN VALJEAN THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
HERE IS COSETTE'S EDUCATION ALREADY PROVIDED
FAUCHELEVENT EXCLAIMED
PARDINE THERE ARE LITTLE GIRLS INDEED AND THEY WOULD BAWL AROUND YOU
AND THEY WOULD RUSH OFF TO BE A MAN HERE IS TO HAVE THE PLAGUE
YOU SEE
HOW THEY FASTEN A BELL TO MY PAW AS THOUGH I WERE A WILD BEAST
JEAN VALJEAN FELL INTO MORE AND MORE PROFOUND THOUGHT THIS CONVENT
WOULD BE OUR SALVATION HE MURMURED
THEN HE RAISED HIS VOICE
YES THE DIFFICULTY IS TO REMAIN HERE
NO SAID FAUCHELEVENT THE DIFFICULTY IS TO GET OUT
JEAN VALJEAN FELT THE BLOOD RUSH BACK TO HIS HEART
TO GET OUT
YES MONSIEUR MADELEINE
IN ORDER TO RETURN HERE IT IS FIRST NECESSARY
TO GET OUT
AND AFTER WAITING UNTIL ANOTHER STROKE OF THE KNELL HAD SOUNDED
FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON
YOU MUST NOT BE FOUND HERE IN THIS FASHION
WHENCE COME YOU FOR ME
YOU FALL FROM HEAVEN BECAUSE I KNOW YOU BUT THE NUNS REQUIRE ONE TO
ENTER BY THE DOOR
ALL AT ONCE THEY HEARD A RATHER COMPLICATED PEALING FROM ANOTHER BELL
AH SAID FAUCHELEVENT THEY ARE RINGING UP THE VOCAL MOTHERS
THEY
ARE GOING TO THE CHAPTER
THEY ALWAYS HOLD A CHAPTER WHEN ANY ONE DIES
SHE DIED AT DAYBREAK
PEOPLE GENERALLY DO DIE AT DAYBREAK
BUT CANNOT
YOU GET OUT BY THE WAY IN WHICH YOU ENTERED COME I DO NOT ASK FOR THE
SAKE OF QUESTIONING YOU BUT HOW DID YOU GET IN
JEAN VALJEAN TURNED PALE THE VERY THOUGHT OF DESCENDING AGAIN INTO
THAT TERRIBLE STREET MADE HIM SHUDDER
YOU MAKE YOUR WAY OUT OF A FOREST
FILLED WITH TIGERS AND ONCE OUT OF IT IMAGINE A FRIENDLY COUNSEL THAT
SHALL ADVISE YOU TO RETURN THITHER JEAN VALJEAN PICTURED TO HIMSELF THE
WHOLE POLICE FORCE STILL ENGAGED IN SWARMING IN THAT QUARTER AGENTS ON
THE WATCH SENTINELS EVERYWHERE FRIGHTFUL FISTS EXTENDED TOWARDS HIS
COLLAR JAVERT AT THE CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION OF THE STREETS PERHAPS
IMPOSSIBLE SAID HE
FATHER FAUCHELEVENT SAY THAT I FELL FROM THE
SKY
BUT I BELIEVE IT I BELIEVE IT RETORTED FAUCHELEVENT
YOU HAVE NO
NEED TO TELL ME THAT
THE GOOD GOD MUST HAVE TAKEN YOU IN HIS HAND FOR
THE PURPOSE OF GETTING A GOOD LOOK AT YOU CLOSE TO AND THEN DROPPED
YOU
ONLY HE MEANT TO PLACE YOU IN A MAN'S CONVENT HE MADE A MISTAKE
COME THERE GOES ANOTHER PEAL THAT IS TO ORDER THE PORTER TO GO AND
INFORM THE MUNICIPALITY THAT THE DEAD DOCTOR IS TO COME HERE AND VIEW A
CORPSE
ALL THAT IS THE CEREMONY OF DYING
THESE GOOD LADIES ARE NOT
AT ALL FOND OF THAT VISIT
A DOCTOR IS A MAN WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE IN
ANYTHING
HE LIFTS THE VEIL
SOMETIMES HE LIFTS SOMETHING ELSE TOO
HOW
QUICKLY THEY HAVE HAD THE DOCTOR SUMMONED THIS TIME WHAT IS THE MATTER
YOUR LITTLE ONE IS STILL ASLEEP
WHAT IS HER NAME
COSETTE
SHE IS YOUR DAUGHTER YOU ARE HER GRANDFATHER THAT IS
YES
IT WILL BE EASY ENOUGH FOR HER TO GET OUT OF HERE
I HAVE MY SERVICE
DOOR WHICH OPENS ON THE COURTYARD
I KNOCK
THE PORTER OPENS I HAVE
MY VINTAGE BASKET ON MY BACK THE CHILD IS IN IT I GO OUT
FATHER
FAUCHELEVENT GOES OUT WITH HIS BASKET THAT IS PERFECTLY NATURAL
YOU
WILL TELL THE CHILD TO KEEP VERY QUIET
SHE WILL BE UNDER THE COVER
I
WILL LEAVE HER FOR WHATEVER TIME IS REQUIRED WITH A GOOD OLD FRIEND A
FRUIT SELLER WHOM I KNOW IN THE RUE CHEMIN VERT WHO IS DEAF AND WHO
HAS A LITTLE BED
I WILL SHOUT IN THE FRUIT SELLER'S EAR THAT SHE IS A
NIECE OF MINE AND THAT SHE IS TO KEEP HER FOR ME UNTIL TO MORROW
THEN
THE LITTLE ONE WILL RE ENTER WITH YOU FOR I WILL CONTRIVE TO HAVE YOU
RE ENTER
IT MUST BE DONE
BUT HOW WILL YOU MANAGE TO GET OUT
JEAN VALJEAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
NO ONE MUST SEE ME THE WHOLE POINT LIES THERE FATHER FAUCHELEVENT
FIND SOME MEANS OF GETTING ME OUT IN A BASKET UNDER COVER LIKE
COSETTE
FAUCHELEVENT SCRATCHED THE LOBE OF HIS EAR WITH THE MIDDLE FINGER OF HIS
LEFT HAND A SIGN OF SERIOUS EMBARRASSMENT
A THIRD PEAL CREATED A DIVERSION
THAT IS THE DEAD DOCTOR TAKING HIS DEPARTURE SAID FAUCHELEVENT
HE
HAS TAKEN A LOOK AND SAID 'SHE IS DEAD THAT IS WELL WHEN THE DOCTOR
HAS SIGNED THE PASSPORT FOR PARADISE THE UNDERTAKER'S COMPANY SENDS A
COFFIN
IF IT IS A MOTHER THE MOTHERS LAY HER OUT IF SHE IS A SISTER
THE SISTERS LAY HER OUT
AFTER WHICH I NAIL HER UP
THAT FORMS A PART
OF MY GARDENER'S DUTY
A GARDENER IS A BIT OF A GRAVE DIGGER
SHE IS
PLACED IN A LOWER HALL OF THE CHURCH WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE STREET
AND INTO WHICH NO MAN MAY ENTER SAVE THE DOCTOR OF THE DEAD
I DON'T
COUNT THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN AND MYSELF AS MEN
IT IS IN THAT HALL THAT I
NAIL UP THE COFFIN
THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN COME AND GET IT AND WHIP
UP COACHMAN THAT'S THE WAY ONE GOES TO HEAVEN
THEY FETCH A BOX WITH
NOTHING IN IT THEY TAKE IT AWAY AGAIN WITH SOMETHING IN IT
THAT'S WHAT
A BURIAL IS LIKE
DE PROFUNDIS
A HORIZONTAL RAY OF SUNSHINE LIGHTLY TOUCHED THE FACE OF THE SLEEPING
COSETTE WHO LAY WITH HER MOUTH VAGUELY OPEN AND HAD THE AIR OF AN
ANGEL DRINKING IN THE LIGHT
JEAN VALJEAN HAD FALLEN TO GAZING AT HER
HE WAS NO LONGER LISTENING TO FAUCHELEVENT
THAT ONE IS NOT LISTENED TO IS NO REASON FOR PRESERVING SILENCE
THE
GOOD OLD GARDENER WENT ON TRANQUILLY WITH HIS BABBLE
THE GRAVE IS DUG IN THE VAUGIRARD CEMETERY
THEY DECLARE THAT THEY ARE
GOING TO SUPPRESS THAT VAUGIRARD CEMETERY
IT IS AN ANCIENT CEMETERY
WHICH IS OUTSIDE THE REGULATIONS WHICH HAS NO UNIFORM AND WHICH IS
GOING TO RETIRE
IT IS A SHAME FOR IT IS CONVENIENT
I HAVE A FRIEND
THERE FATHER MESTIENNE THE GRAVE DIGGER
THE NUNS HERE POSSESS ONE
PRIVILEGE IT IS TO BE TAKEN TO THAT CEMETERY AT NIGHTFALL
THERE IS
A SPECIAL PERMISSION FROM THE PREFECTURE ON THEIR BEHALF
BUT HOW MANY
EVENTS HAVE HAPPENED SINCE YESTERDAY MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS DEAD AND
FATHER MADELEINE
IS BURIED SAID JEAN VALJEAN SMILING SADLY
FAUCHELEVENT CAUGHT THE WORD
GOODNESS IF YOU WERE HERE FOR GOOD IT WOULD BE A REAL BURIAL
A FOURTH PEAL BURST OUT
FAUCHELEVENT HASTILY DETACHED THE BELLED
KNEE CAP FROM ITS NAIL AND BUCKLED IT ON HIS KNEE AGAIN
THIS TIME IT IS FOR ME
THE MOTHER PRIORESS WANTS ME
GOOD NOW I AM
PRICKING MYSELF ON THE TONGUE OF MY BUCKLE
MONSIEUR MADELEINE DON'T
STIR FROM HERE AND WAIT FOR ME
SOMETHING NEW HAS COME UP
IF YOU ARE
HUNGRY THERE IS WINE BREAD AND CHEESE
AND HE HASTENED OUT OF THE HUT CRYING COMING COMING
JEAN VALJEAN WATCHED HIM HURRYING ACROSS THE GARDEN AS FAST AS HIS
CROOKED LEG WOULD PERMIT CASTING A SIDELONG GLANCE BY THE WAY ON HIS
MELON PATCH
LESS THAN TEN MINUTES LATER FATHER FAUCHELEVENT WHOSE BELL PUT THE
NUNS IN HIS ROAD TO FLIGHT TAPPED GENTLY AT A DOOR AND A GENTLE VOICE
REPLIED FOREVER FOREVER THAT IS TO SAY ENTER
THE DOOR WAS THE ONE LEADING TO THE PARLOR RESERVED FOR SEEING THE
GARDENER ON BUSINESS
THIS PARLOR ADJOINED THE CHAPTER HALL
THE
PRIORESS SEATED ON THE ONLY CHAIR IN THE PARLOR WAS WAITING FOR
FAUCHELEVENT
CHAPTER II FAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTY
IT IS THE PECULIARITY OF CERTAIN PERSONS AND CERTAIN PROFESSIONS
NOTABLY PRIESTS AND NUNS TO WEAR A GRAVE AND AGITATED AIR ON CRITICAL
OCCASIONS
AT THE MOMENT WHEN FAUCHELEVENT ENTERED THIS DOUBLE FORM OF
PREOCCUPATION WAS IMPRINTED ON THE COUNTENANCE OF THE PRIORESS WHO WAS
THAT WISE AND CHARMING MADEMOISELLE DE BLEMEUR MOTHER INNOCENTE WHO
WAS ORDINARILY CHEERFUL
THE GARDENER MADE A TIMID BOW AND REMAINED AT THE DOOR OF THE CELL
THE
PRIORESS WHO WAS TELLING HER BEADS RAISED HER EYES AND SAID
AH IT IS YOU FATHER FAUVENT
THIS ABBREVIATION HAD BEEN ADOPTED IN THE CONVENT
FAUCHELEVENT BOWED AGAIN
FATHER FAUVENT I HAVE SENT FOR YOU
HERE I AM REVEREND MOTHER
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU
AND SO HAVE I SAID FAUCHELEVENT WITH A BOLDNESS WHICH CAUSED HIM
INWARD TERROR I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO THE VERY REVEREND MOTHER
THE PRIORESS STARED AT HIM
AH YOU HAVE A COMMUNICATION TO MAKE TO ME
A REQUEST
VERY WELL SPEAK
GOODMAN FAUCHELEVENT THE EX NOTARY BELONGED TO THE CATEGORY OF
PEASANTS WHO HAVE ASSURANCE
A CERTAIN CLEVER IGNORANCE CONSTITUTES A
FORCE YOU DO NOT DISTRUST IT AND YOU ARE CAUGHT BY IT
FAUCHELEVENT
HAD BEEN A SUCCESS DURING THE SOMETHING MORE THAN TWO YEARS WHICH HE HAD
PASSED IN THE CONVENT
ALWAYS SOLITARY AND BUSIED ABOUT HIS GARDENING
HE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO THAN TO INDULGE HIS CURIOSITY
AS HE WAS AT A
DISTANCE FROM ALL THOSE VEILED WOMEN PASSING TO AND FRO HE SAW BEFORE
HIM ONLY AN AGITATION OF SHADOWS
BY DINT OF ATTENTION AND SHARPNESS
HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN CLOTHING ALL THOSE PHANTOMS WITH FLESH AND THOSE
CORPSES WERE ALIVE FOR HIM
HE WAS LIKE A DEAF MAN WHOSE SIGHT GROWS
KEENER AND LIKE A BLIND MAN WHOSE HEARING BECOMES MORE ACUTE
HE HAD
APPLIED HIMSELF TO RIDDLING OUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIFFERENT PEALS
AND HE HAD SUCCEEDED SO THAT THIS TACITURN AND ENIGMATICAL CLOISTER
POSSESSED NO SECRETS FOR HIM THE SPHINX BABBLED ALL HER SECRETS IN HIS
EAR
FAUCHELEVENT KNEW ALL AND CONCEALED ALL THAT CONSTITUTED HIS ART
THE WHOLE CONVENT THOUGHT HIM STUPID
A GREAT MERIT IN RELIGION
THE
VOCAL MOTHERS MADE MUCH OF FAUCHELEVENT
HE WAS A CURIOUS MUTE
HE
INSPIRED CONFIDENCE
MOREOVER HE WAS REGULAR AND NEVER WENT OUT EXCEPT
FOR WELL DEMONSTRATED REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORCHARD AND VEGETABLE GARDEN
THIS DISCRETION OF CONDUCT HAD INURED TO HIS CREDIT
NONE THE LESS HE
HAD SET TWO MEN TO CHATTERING THE PORTER IN THE CONVENT AND HE
KNEW THE SINGULARITIES OF THEIR PARLOR AND THE GRAVE DIGGER AT
THE CEMETERY AND HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE PECULIARITIES OF THEIR
SEPULTURE IN THIS WAY HE POSSESSED A DOUBLE LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT OF
THESE NUNS ONE AS TO THEIR LIFE THE OTHER AS TO THEIR DEATH
BUT HE
DID NOT ABUSE HIS KNOWLEDGE
THE CONGREGATION THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF
HIM
OLD LAME BLIND TO EVERYTHING PROBABLY A LITTLE DEAF INTO THE
BARGAIN WHAT QUALITIES THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO REPLACE
HIM
THE GOODMAN WITH THE ASSURANCE OF A PERSON WHO FEELS THAT HE IS
APPRECIATED ENTERED INTO A RATHER DIFFUSE AND VERY DEEP RUSTIC HARANGUE
TO THE REVEREND PRIORESS
HE TALKED A LONG TIME ABOUT HIS AGE HIS
INFIRMITIES THE SURCHARGE OF YEARS COUNTING DOUBLE FOR HIM HENCEFORTH
OF THE INCREASING DEMANDS OF HIS WORK OF THE GREAT SIZE OF THE GARDEN
OF NIGHTS WHICH MUST BE PASSED LIKE THE LAST FOR INSTANCE WHEN HE HAD
BEEN OBLIGED TO PUT STRAW MATS OVER THE MELON BEDS BECAUSE OF THE MOON
AND HE WOUND UP AS FOLLOWS THAT HE HAD A BROTHER THE PRIORESS MADE
A MOVEMENT A BROTHER NO LONGER YOUNG A SECOND MOVEMENT ON THE
PART OF THE PRIORESS BUT ONE EXPRESSIVE OF REASSURANCE THAT IF HE
MIGHT BE PERMITTED THIS BROTHER WOULD COME AND LIVE WITH HIM AND HELP
HIM THAT HE WAS AN EXCELLENT GARDENER THAT THE COMMUNITY WOULD RECEIVE
FROM HIM GOOD SERVICE BETTER THAN HIS OWN THAT OTHERWISE IF HIS
BROTHER WERE NOT ADMITTED AS HE THE ELDER FELT THAT HIS HEALTH WAS
BROKEN AND THAT HE WAS INSUFFICIENT FOR THE WORK HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED
GREATLY TO HIS REGRET TO GO AWAY AND THAT HIS BROTHER HAD A LITTLE
DAUGHTER WHOM HE WOULD BRING WITH HIM WHO MIGHT BE REARED FOR GOD IN
THE HOUSE AND WHO MIGHT WHO KNOWS BECOME A NUN SOME DAY
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING THE PRIORESS STAYED THE SLIPPING OF HER
ROSARY BETWEEN HER FINGERS AND SAID TO HIM
COULD YOU PROCURE A STOUT IRON BAR BETWEEN NOW AND THIS EVENING
FOR WHAT PURPOSE
TO SERVE AS A LEVER
YES REVEREND MOTHER REPLIED FAUCHELEVENT
THE PRIORESS WITHOUT ADDING A WORD ROSE AND ENTERED THE ADJOINING
ROOM WHICH WAS THE HALL OF THE CHAPTER AND WHERE THE VOCAL MOTHERS
WERE PROBABLY ASSEMBLED
FAUCHELEVENT WAS LEFT ALONE
CHAPTER III MOTHER INNOCENTE
ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR ELAPSED
THE PRIORESS RETURNED AND SEATED
HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
THE TWO INTERLOCUTORS SEEMED PREOCCUPIED
WE WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC
REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
FATHER FAUVENT
REVEREND MOTHER
DO YOU KNOW THE CHAPEL
I HAVE A LITTLE CAGE THERE WHERE I HEAR THE MASS AND THE OFFICES
AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES
TWO OR THREE TIMES
THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED
HEAVY
THE SLAB OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT
YES
IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR IT
MOTHER ASCENSION WHO IS AS STRONG AS A MAN WILL HELP YOU
A WOMAN IS NEVER A MAN
WE HAVE ONLY A WOMAN HERE TO HELP YOU
EACH ONE DOES WHAT HE CAN
BECAUSE DOM MABILLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF
SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSTIUS ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND
SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLONUS HORSTIUS
NEITHER DO I
MERIT CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH
A CLOISTER IS
NOT A DOCK YARD
AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN
BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
AND CAN YOU GET A LEVER
THAT IS THE ONLY SORT OF KEY THAT FITS THAT SORT OF DOOR
THERE IS A RING IN THE STONE
I WILL PUT THE LEVER THROUGH IT
AND THE STONE IS SO ARRANGED THAT IT SWINGS ON A PIVOT
THAT IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER
I WILL OPEN THE VAULT
AND THE FOUR MOTHER PRECENTORS WILL HELP YOU
AND WHEN THE VAULT IS OPEN
IT MUST BE CLOSED AGAIN
WILL THAT BE ALL
NO
GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS VERY REVEREND MOTHER
FAUVENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
I AM HERE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISH
AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERYTHING
YES REVEREND MOTHER
WHEN THE VAULT IS OPEN
I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
BUT BEFORE THAT
WHAT REVEREND MOTHER
SOMETHING MUST BE LOWERED INTO IT
A SILENCE ENSUED
THE PRIORESS AFTER A POUT OF THE UNDER LIP WHICH
RESEMBLED HESITATION BROKE IT
FATHER FAUVENT
REVEREND MOTHER
YOU KNOW THAT A MOTHER DIED THIS MORNING
NO
DID YOU NOT HEAR THE BELL
NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
REALLY
I CAN HARDLY DISTINGUISH MY OWN SIGNAL
SHE DIED AT DAYBREAK
AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS MORNING
IT WAS MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
A BLESSED WOMAN
THE PRIORESS PAUSED MOVED HER LIPS AS THOUGH IN MENTAL PRAYER AND
RESUMED
THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX
MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER
AH YES NOW I HEAR THE KNELL REVEREND MOTHER
THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE
CHURCH
I KNOW
NO OTHER MAN THAN YOU CAN OR MUST ENTER THAT CHAMBER
SEE TO THAT
A
FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM
MORE OFTEN
HEY
MORE OFTEN
WHAT DO YOU SAY
I SAY MORE OFTEN
MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT
REVEREND MOTHER I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MORE
OFTEN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU
WHY DO YOU SAY MORE OFTEN
IN ORDER TO SPEAK LIKE YOU REVEREND MOTHER
BUT I DID NOT SAY 'MORE OFTEN
AT THAT MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK
AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE
THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR SAID THE PRIORESS
AMEN SAID FAUCHELEVENT
THE CLOCK STRUCK OPPORTUNELY
IT CUT MORE OFTEN SHORT
IT IS PROBABLE
THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS THE PRIORESS AND FAUCHELEVENT WOULD NEVER
HAVE UNRAVELLED THAT SKEIN
FAUCHELEVENT MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD
THE PRIORESS INDULGED IN ANOTHER LITTLE INWARD MURMUR PROBABLY SACRED
THEN RAISED HER VOICE
IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE
WILL PERFORM MIRACLES
SHE WILL REPLIED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT FALLING INTO STEP AND STRIVING
NOT TO FLINCH AGAIN
FATHER FAUVENT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
NO DOUBT IT IS NOT GRANTED TO EVERY ONE TO DIE LIKE CARDINAL DE
BERULLE WHILE SAYING THE HOLY MASS AND TO BREATHE FORTH THEIR SOULS TO
GOD WHILE PRONOUNCING THESE WORDS HANC IGITUR OBLATIONEM
BUT WITHOUT
ATTAINING TO SUCH HAPPINESS MOTHER CRUCIFIXION'S DEATH WAS VERY
PRECIOUS
SHE RETAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
SHE SPOKE TO US THEN SHE SPOKE TO THE ANGELS
SHE GAVE US HER LAST
COMMANDS
IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN
IN HER CELL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT
SHE SMILED
WE FELT THAT SHE WAS REGAINING HER LIFE IN GOD
THERE WAS
SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT DEATH
FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING
AMEN SAID HE
FATHER FAUVENT WHAT THE DEAD WISH MUST BE DONE
THE PRIORESS TOOK OFF SEVERAL BEADS OF HER CHAPLET
FAUCHELEVENT HELD
HIS PEACE
SHE WENT ON
I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR
LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND
WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
REVEREND MOTHER YOU CAN HEAR THE KNELL MUCH BETTER HERE THAN IN THE
GARDEN
BESIDES SHE IS MORE THAN A DEAD WOMAN SHE IS A SAINT
LIKE YOURSELF REVEREND MOTHER
SHE SLEPT IN HER COFFIN FOR TWENTY YEARS BY EXPRESS PERMISSION OF OUR
HOLY FATHER PIUS VII
THE ONE WHO CROWNED THE EMP BUONAPARTE
FOR A CLEVER MAN LIKE FAUCHELEVENT THIS ALLUSION WAS AN AWKWARD ONE
FORTUNATELY THE PRIORESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID
NOT HEAR IT
SHE CONTINUED
FATHER FAUVENT
REVEREND MOTHER
SAINT DIDORUS ARCHBISHOP OF CAPPADOCIA DESIRED THAT THIS SINGLE WORD
MIGHT BE INSCRIBED ON HIS TOMB ACARUS WHICH SIGNIFIES A WORM OF THE
EARTH THIS WAS DONE
IS THIS TRUE
YES REVEREND MOTHER
THE BLESSED MEZZOCANE ABBOT OF AQUILA WISHED TO BE BURIED BENEATH THE
GALLOWS THIS WAS DONE
THAT IS TRUE
SAINT TERENTIUS BISHOP OF PORT WHERE THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER EMPTIES
INTO THE SEA REQUESTED THAT ON HIS TOMB MIGHT BE ENGRAVED THE
SIGN WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE GRAVES OF PARRICIDES IN THE HOPE THAT
PASSERS BY WOULD SPIT ON HIS TOMB
THIS WAS DONE
THE DEAD MUST BE
OBEYED
SO BE IT
THE BODY OF BERNARD GUIDONIS BORN IN FRANCE NEAR ROCHE ABEILLE WAS
AS HE HAD ORDERED AND IN SPITE OF THE KING OF CASTILE BORNE TO THE
CHURCH OF THE DOMINICANS IN LIMOGES ALTHOUGH BERNARD GUIDONIS WAS
BISHOP OF TUY IN SPAIN
CAN THE CONTRARY BE AFFIRMED
FOR THAT MATTER NO REVEREND MOTHER
THE FACT IS ATTESTED BY PLANTAVIT DE LA FOSSE
SEVERAL BEADS OF THE CHAPLET WERE TOLD OFF STILL IN SILENCE
THE
PRIORESS RESUMED
FATHER FAUVENT MOTHER CRUCIFIXION WILL BE INTERRED IN THE COFFIN IN
WHICH SHE HAS SLEPT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS
THAT IS JUST
IT IS A CONTINUATION OF HER SLUMBER
SO I SHALL HAVE TO NAIL UP THAT COFFIN
YES
AND WE ARE TO REJECT THE UNDERTAKER'S COFFIN
PRECISELY
I AM AT THE ORDERS OF THE VERY REVEREND COMMUNITY
THE FOUR MOTHER PRECENTORS WILL ASSIST YOU
IN NAILING UP THE COFFIN I DO NOT NEED THEM
NO
IN LOWERING THE COFFIN
WHERE
INTO THE VAULT
WHAT VAULT
UNDER THE ALTAR
FAUCHELEVENT STARTED
THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR
UNDER THE ALTAR
BUT
YOU WILL HAVE AN IRON BAR
YES BUT
YOU WILL RAISE THE STONE WITH THE BAR BY MEANS OF THE RING
BUT
THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED
TO BE BURIED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF
THE CHAPEL NOT TO GO TO PROFANE EARTH TO REMAIN THERE IN DEATH WHERE
SHE PRAYED WHILE LIVING SUCH WAS THE LAST WISH OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
SHE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED US
BUT IT IS FORBIDDEN
FORBIDDEN BY MEN ENJOINED BY GOD
WHAT IF IT BECAME KNOWN
WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
OH I AM A STONE IN YOUR WALLS
THE CHAPTER ASSEMBLED
THE VOCAL MOTHERS WHOM I HAVE JUST CONSULTED
AGAIN AND WHO ARE NOW DELIBERATING HAVE DECIDED THAT MOTHER
CRUCIFIXION SHALL BE BURIED ACCORDING TO HER WISH IN HER OWN COFFIN
UNDER OUR ALTAR
THINK FATHER FAUVENT IF SHE WERE TO WORK MIRACLES
HERE WHAT A GLORY OF GOD FOR THE COMMUNITY AND MIRACLES ISSUE FROM
TOMBS
BUT REVEREND MOTHER IF THE AGENT OF THE SANITARY COMMISSION
SAINT BENOIT II IN THE MATTER OF SEPULTURE RESISTED CONSTANTINE
POGONATUS
BUT THE COMMISSARY OF POLICE
CHONODEMAIRE ONE OF THE SEVEN GERMAN KINGS WHO ENTERED AMONG THE GAULS
UNDER THE EMPIRE OF CONSTANTIUS EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT OF NUNS
TO BE BURIED IN RELIGION THAT IS TO SAY BENEATH THE ALTAR
BUT THE INSPECTOR FROM THE PREFECTURE
THE WORLD IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CROSS
MARTIN THE ELEVENTH
GENERAL OF THE CARTHUSIANS GAVE TO HIS ORDER THIS DEVICE STAT CRUX DUM
VOLVITUR ORBIS
AMEN SAID FAUCHELEVENT WHO IMPERTURBABLY EXTRICATED HIMSELF IN THIS
MANNER FROM THE DILEMMA WHENEVER HE HEARD LATIN
ANY AUDIENCE SUFFICES FOR A PERSON WHO HAS HELD HIS PEACE TOO LONG
ON
THE DAY WHEN THE RHETORICIAN GYMNASTORAS LEFT HIS PRISON BEARING IN
HIS BODY MANY DILEMMAS AND NUMEROUS SYLLOGISMS WHICH HAD STRUCK IN HE
HALTED IN FRONT OF THE FIRST TREE WHICH HE CAME TO HARANGUED IT AND
MADE VERY GREAT EFFORTS TO CONVINCE IT
THE PRIORESS WHO WAS USUALLY
SUBJECTED TO THE BARRIER OF SILENCE AND WHOSE RESERVOIR WAS OVERFULL
ROSE AND EXCLAIMED WITH THE LOQUACITY OF A DAM WHICH HAS BROKEN AWAY
I HAVE ON MY RIGHT BENOIT AND ON MY LEFT BERNARD
WHO WAS BERNARD THE
FIRST ABBOT OF CLAIRVAUX
FONTAINES IN BURGUNDY IS A COUNTRY THAT IS
BLEST BECAUSE IT GAVE HIM BIRTH
HIS FATHER WAS NAMED TECELIN AND HIS
MOTHER ALETHE
HE BEGAN AT CITEAUX TO END IN CLAIRVAUX HE WAS ORDAINED
ABBOT BY THE BISHOP OF CHALON SUR SAONE GUILLAUME DE CHAMPEAUX HE HAD
SEVEN HUNDRED NOVICES AND FOUNDED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MONASTERIES HE
OVERTHREW ABEILARD AT THE COUNCIL OF SENS IN 1140 AND PIERRE DE BRUYS
AND HENRY HIS DISCIPLE AND ANOTHER SORT OF ERRING SPIRITS WHO WERE
CALLED THE APOSTOLICS HE CONFOUNDED ARNAULD DE BRESCIA DARTED
LIGHTNING AT THE MONK RAOUL THE MURDERER OF THE JEWS DOMINATED THE
COUNCIL OF REIMS IN 1148 CAUSED THE CONDEMNATION OF GILBERT DE POREA
BISHOP OF POITIERS CAUSED THE CONDEMNATION OF EON DE L'ETOILE ARRANGED
THE DISPUTES OF PRINCES ENLIGHTENED KING LOUIS THE YOUNG ADVISED POPE
EUGENE III REGULATED THE TEMPLE PREACHED THE CRUSADE PERFORMED
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MIRACLES DURING HIS LIFETIME AND AS MANY
AS THIRTY NINE IN ONE DAY
WHO WAS BENOIT HE WAS THE PATRIARCH OF
MONT CASSIN HE WAS THE SECOND FOUNDER OF THE SAINTETE CLAUSTRALE
HE WAS THE BASIL OF THE WEST
HIS ORDER HAS PRODUCED FORTY POPES TWO
HUNDRED CARDINALS FIFTY PATRIARCHS SIXTEEN HUNDRED ARCHBISHOPS FOUR
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED BISHOPS FOUR EMPERORS TWELVE EMPRESSES FORTY SIX
KINGS FORTY ONE QUEENS THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CANONIZED SAINTS
AND HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEARS
ON ONE SIDE SAINT
BERNARD ON THE OTHER THE AGENT OF THE SANITARY DEPARTMENT ON ONE SIDE
SAINT BENOIT ON THE OTHER THE INSPECTOR OF PUBLIC WAYS THE STATE
THE ROAD COMMISSIONERS THE PUBLIC UNDERTAKER REGULATIONS THE
ADMINISTRATION WHAT DO WE KNOW OF ALL THAT THERE IS NOT A CHANCE
PASSER BY WHO WOULD NOT BE INDIGNANT TO SEE HOW WE ARE TREATED
WE
HAVE NOT EVEN THE RIGHT TO GIVE OUR DUST TO JESUS CHRIST YOUR SANITARY
DEPARTMENT IS A REVOLUTIONARY INVENTION
GOD SUBORDINATED TO THE
COMMISSARY OF POLICE SUCH IS THE AGE
SILENCE FAUVENT
FAUCHELEVENT WAS BUT ILL AT EASE UNDER THIS SHOWER BATH
THE PRIORESS
CONTINUED
NO ONE DOUBTS THE RIGHT OF THE MONASTERY TO SEPULTURE
ONLY FANATICS
AND THOSE IN ERROR DENY IT
WE LIVE IN TIMES OF TERRIBLE CONFUSION
WE
DO NOT KNOW THAT WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW AND WE KNOW THAT WHICH
WE SHOULD IGNORE
WE ARE IGNORANT AND IMPIOUS
IN THIS AGE THERE EXIST
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE VERY GREAT SAINT BERNARD AND
THE SAINT BERNARD DENOMINATED OF THE POOR CATHOLICS A CERTAIN GOOD
ECCLESIASTIC WHO LIVED IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY
OTHERS ARE SO
BLASPHEMOUS AS TO COMPARE THE SCAFFOLD OF LOUIS XVI
TO THE CROSS OF
JESUS CHRIST
LOUIS XVI
WAS MERELY A KING
LET US BEWARE OF GOD THERE
IS NO LONGER JUST NOR UNJUST
THE NAME OF VOLTAIRE IS KNOWN BUT NOT
THE NAME OF CESAR DE BUS
NEVERTHELESS CESAR DE BUS IS A MAN OF BLESSED
MEMORY AND VOLTAIRE ONE OF UNBLESSED MEMORY
THE LAST ARCH BISHOP
THE CARDINAL DE PERIGORD DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT CHARLES DE
GONDREN SUCCEEDED TO BERULLE AND FRANCOIS BOURGOIN TO GONDREN
AND JEAN FRANCOIS SENAULT TO BOURGOIN AND FATHER SAINTE MARTHE TO
JEAN FRANCOIS SENAULT
THE NAME OF FATHER COTON IS KNOWN NOT BECAUSE
HE WAS ONE OF THE THREE WHO URGED THE FOUNDATION OF THE ORATORIE BUT
BECAUSE HE FURNISHED HENRI IV THE HUGUENOT KING WITH THE MATERIAL
FOR AN OATH
THAT WHICH PLEASES PEOPLE OF THE WORLD IN SAINT FRANCOIS DE
SALES IS THAT HE CHEATED AT PLAY
AND THEN RELIGION IS ATTACKED
WHY
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN BAD PRIESTS BECAUSE SAGITTAIRE BISHOP OF GAP
WAS THE BROTHER OF SALONE BISHOP OF EMBRUN AND BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM
FOLLOWED MOMMOL
WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH THE QUESTION DOES THAT
PREVENT MARTIN DE TOURS FROM BEING A SAINT AND GIVING HALF OF HIS CLOAK
TO A BEGGAR THEY PERSECUTE THE SAINTS
THEY SHUT THEIR EYES TO THE
TRUTH
DARKNESS IS THE RULE
THE MOST FEROCIOUS BEASTS ARE BEASTS WHICH
ARE BLIND
NO ONE THINKS OF HELL AS A REALITY
OH HOW WICKED PEOPLE
ARE BY ORDER OF THE KING SIGNIFIES TO DAY BY ORDER OF THE REVOLUTION
ONE NO LONGER KNOWS WHAT IS DUE TO THE LIVING OR TO THE DEAD
A HOLY
DEATH IS PROHIBITED
BURIAL IS A CIVIL MATTER
THIS IS HORRIBLE
SAINT
LEO II
WROTE TWO SPECIAL LETTERS ONE TO PIERRE NOTAIRE THE OTHER TO
THE KING OF THE VISIGOTHS FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMBATING AND REJECTING
IN QUESTIONS TOUCHING THE DEAD THE AUTHORITY OF THE EXARCH AND THE
SUPREMACY OF THE EMPEROR
GAUTHIER BISHOP OF CHALONS HELD HIS OWN
IN THIS MATTER AGAINST OTHO DUKE OF BURGUNDY
THE ANCIENT MAGISTRACY
AGREED WITH HIM
IN FORMER TIMES WE HAD VOICES IN THE CHAPTER EVEN ON
MATTERS OF THE DAY
THE ABBOT OF CITEAUX THE GENERAL OF THE ORDER WAS
COUNCILLOR BY RIGHT OF BIRTH TO THE PARLIAMENT OF BURGUNDY
WE DO WHAT
WE PLEASE WITH OUR DEAD
IS NOT THE BODY OF SAINT BENOIT HIMSELF IN
FRANCE IN THE ABBEY OF FLEURY CALLED SAINT BENOIT SUR LOIRE ALTHOUGH
HE DIED IN ITALY AT MONT CASSIN ON SATURDAY THE 21ST OF THE MONTH
OF MARCH OF THE YEAR 543 ALL THIS IS INCONTESTABLE
I ABHOR
PSALM SINGERS I HATE PRIORS I EXECRATE HERETICS BUT I SHOULD DETEST
YET MORE ANY ONE WHO SHOULD MAINTAIN THE CONTRARY
ONE HAS ONLY TO
READ ARNOUL WION GABRIEL BUCELIN TRITHEMUS MAUROLICS AND DOM LUC
D'ACHERY
THE PRIORESS TOOK BREATH THEN TURNED TO FAUCHELEVENT
IS IT SETTLED FATHER FAUVENT
IT IS SETTLED REVEREND MOTHER
WE MAY DEPEND ON YOU
I WILL OBEY
THAT IS WELL
I AM ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO THE CONVENT
THAT IS UNDERSTOOD
YOU WILL CLOSE THE COFFIN
THE SISTERS WILL CARRY
IT TO THE CHAPEL
THE OFFICE FOR THE DEAD WILL THEN BE SAID
THEN WE
SHALL RETURN TO THE CLOISTER
BETWEEN ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND MIDNIGHT YOU
WILL COME WITH YOUR IRON BAR
ALL WILL BE DONE IN THE MOST PROFOUND
SECRECY
THERE WILL BE IN THE CHAPEL ONLY THE FOUR MOTHER PRECENTORS
MOTHER ASCENSION AND YOURSELF
AND THE SISTER AT THE POST
SHE WILL NOT TURN ROUND
BUT SHE WILL HEAR
SHE WILL NOT LISTEN
BESIDES WHAT THE CLOISTER KNOWS THE WORLD LEARNS
NOT
A PAUSE ENSUED
THE PRIORESS WENT ON
YOU WILL REMOVE YOUR BELL
IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT THE SISTER AT THE
POST SHOULD PERCEIVE YOUR PRESENCE
REVEREND MOTHER
WHAT FATHER FAUVENT
HAS THE DOCTOR FOR THE DEAD PAID HIS VISIT
HE WILL PAY IT AT FOUR O'CLOCK TO DAY
THE PEAL WHICH ORDERS THE
DOCTOR FOR THE DEAD TO BE SUMMONED HAS ALREADY BEEN RUNG
BUT YOU DO NOT
UNDERSTAND ANY OF THE PEALS
I PAY NO ATTENTION TO ANY BUT MY OWN
THAT IS WELL FATHER FAUVENT
REVEREND MOTHER A LEVER AT LEAST SIX FEET LONG WILL BE REQUIRED
WHERE WILL YOU OBTAIN IT
WHERE GRATINGS ARE NOT LACKING IRON BARS ARE NOT LACKING
I HAVE MY
HEAP OF OLD IRON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR BEFORE MIDNIGHT DO NOT FORGET
REVEREND MOTHER
WHAT
IF YOU WERE EVER TO HAVE ANY OTHER JOBS OF THIS SORT MY BROTHER IS THE
STRONG MAN FOR YOU
A PERFECT TURK
YOU WILL DO IT AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE
I CANNOT WORK VERY FAST
I AM INFIRM THAT IS WHY I REQUIRE AN
ASSISTANT
I LIMP
TO LIMP IS NO SIN AND PERHAPS IT IS A BLESSING
THE EMPEROR HENRY II
WHO COMBATED ANTIPOPE GREGORY AND RE ESTABLISHED BENOIT VIII HAS TWO
SURNAMES THE SAINT AND THE LAME
TWO SURTOUTS ARE A GOOD THING MURMURED FAUCHELEVENT WHO REALLY WAS A
LITTLE HARD OF HEARING
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT FATHER FAUVENT LET US GIVE A WHOLE HOUR TO IT
THAT IS NOT TOO MUCH
BE NEAR THE PRINCIPAL ALTAR WITH YOUR IRON BAR
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
THE OFFICE BEGINS AT MIDNIGHT
EVERYTHING MUST HAVE
BEEN COMPLETED A GOOD QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THAT
I WILL DO ANYTHING TO PROVE MY ZEAL TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY
THESE ARE MY
ORDERS
I AM TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK EXACTLY I AM TO
BE IN THE CHAPEL
THE MOTHER PRECENTORS WILL BE THERE
MOTHER ASCENSION
WILL BE THERE
TWO MEN WOULD BE BETTER
HOWEVER NEVER MIND I SHALL
HAVE MY LEVER
WE WILL OPEN THE VAULT WE WILL LOWER THE COFFIN AND
WE WILL CLOSE THE VAULT AGAIN
AFTER WHICH THERE WILL BE NO TRACE
OF ANYTHING
THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE NO SUSPICION
THUS ALL HAS BEEN
ARRANGED REVEREND MOTHER
NO
WHAT ELSE REMAINS
THE EMPTY COFFIN REMAINS
THIS PRODUCED A PAUSE
FAUCHELEVENT MEDITATED
THE PRIORESS MEDITATED
WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THAT COFFIN FATHER FAUVENT
IT WILL BE GIVEN TO THE EARTH
EMPTY
ANOTHER SILENCE
FAUCHELEVENT MADE WITH HIS LEFT HAND THAT SORT OF A
GESTURE WHICH DISMISSES A TROUBLESOME SUBJECT
REVEREND MOTHER I AM THE ONE WHO IS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE
BASEMENT OF THE CHURCH AND NO ONE CAN ENTER THERE BUT MYSELF AND I
WILL COVER THE COFFIN WITH THE PALL
YES BUT THE BEARERS WHEN THEY PLACE IT IN THE HEARSE AND LOWER IT
INTO THE GRAVE WILL BE SURE TO FEEL THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN IT
AH THE DE EXCLAIMED FAUCHELEVENT
THE PRIORESS BEGAN TO MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS AND LOOKED FIXEDLY AT
THE GARDENER
THE VIL STUCK FAST IN HIS THROAT
HE MADE HASTE TO IMPROVISE AN EXPEDIENT TO MAKE HER FORGET THE OATH
I WILL PUT EARTH IN THE COFFIN REVEREND MOTHER
THAT WILL PRODUCE THE
EFFECT OF A CORPSE
YOU ARE RIGHT
EARTH THAT IS THE SAME THING AS MAN
SO YOU WILL MANAGE
THE EMPTY COFFIN
I WILL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
THE PRIORESS'S FACE UP TO THAT MOMENT TROUBLED AND CLOUDED GREW SERENE
ONCE MORE
SHE MADE THE SIGN OF A SUPERIOR DISMISSING AN INFERIOR TO
HIM
FAUCHELEVENT WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR
AS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF
PASSING OUT THE PRIORESS RAISED HER VOICE GENTLY
I AM PLEASED WITH YOU FATHER FAUVENT BRING YOUR BROTHER TO ME
TO MORROW AFTER THE BURIAL AND TELL HIM TO FETCH HIS DAUGHTER
CHAPTER IV IN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING READ
AUSTIN CASTILLEJO
THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN
THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
MOREOVER FAUCHELEVENT
WAS IN A DILEMMA
HE TOOK NEARLY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO RETURN TO HIS
COTTAGE IN THE GARDEN
COSETTE HAD WAKED UP
JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER
NEAR THE FIRE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN FAUCHELEVENT ENTERED JEAN VALJEAN WAS
POINTING OUT TO HER THE VINTNER'S BASKET ON THE WALL AND SAYING TO HER
LISTEN ATTENTIVELY TO ME MY LITTLE COSETTE
WE MUST GO AWAY FROM THIS
HOUSE BUT WE SHALL RETURN TO IT AND WE SHALL BE VERY HAPPY HERE
THE
GOOD MAN WHO LIVES HERE IS GOING TO CARRY YOU OFF ON HIS BACK IN THAT
YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE
I SHALL COME TO FETCH YOU
OBEY
AND SAY NOTHING ABOVE ALL THINGS UNLESS YOU WANT MADAME THENARDIER TO
GET YOU AGAIN
COSETTE NODDED GRAVELY
JEAN VALJEAN TURNED ROUND AT THE NOISE MADE BY FAUCHELEVENT OPENING THE
DOOR
WELL
EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
I HAVE
PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE
GOT OUT
THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFICULTY LIES
IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE
CHILD
YOU WILL CARRY HER OUT
AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE
I ANSWER FOR THAT
BUT YOU FATHER MADELEINE
AND AFTER A SILENCE FRAUGHT WITH ANXIETY FAUCHELEVENT EXCLAIMED
WHY GET OUT AS YOU CAME IN
JEAN VALJEAN AS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING
IMPOSSIBLE
FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN
THERE IS ANOTHER THING WHICH BOTHERS ME
I HAVE SAID THAT I WOULD PUT
EARTH IN IT
WHEN I COME TO THINK IT OVER THE EARTH INSTEAD OF THE
CORPSE WILL NOT SEEM LIKE THE REAL THING IT WON'T DO IT WILL GET
DISPLACED IT WILL MOVE ABOUT
THE MEN WILL BEAR IT
YOU UNDERSTAND
FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE IT
JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS
RAVING
FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON
HOW THE DE UCE ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT IT MUST ALL BE DONE BY
TO MORROW MORNING
IT IS TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN
THE
PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A
SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
THAT IT
FELL AMONG HIS DUTIES TO TAKE PART IN THEIR BURIALS THAT HE NAILED UP
THE COFFINS AND HELPED THE GRAVE DIGGER AT THE CEMETERY
THAT THE NUN
WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH
HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF
THE CHAPEL
THAT THE POLICE REGULATIONS FORBADE THIS BUT THAT SHE WAS
ONE OF THOSE DEAD TO WHOM NOTHING IS REFUSED
THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE
VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
THAT IT WAS
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THE GOVERNMENT
THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL
UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE
CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
AND THAT BY WAY OF THANKS THE PRIORESS WAS TO
ADMIT HIS BROTHER TO THE HOUSE AS A GARDENER AND HIS NIECE AS A PUPIL
THAT HIS BROTHER WAS M
MADELEINE AND THAT HIS NIECE WAS COSETTE
THAT
THE PRIORESS HAD TOLD HIM TO BRING HIS BROTHER ON THE FOLLOWING EVENING
AFTER THE COUNTERFEIT INTERMENT IN THE CEMETERY
BUT THAT HE COULD NOT
BRING M
MADELEINE IN FROM THE OUTSIDE IF M
MADELEINE WAS NOT OUTSIDE
THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST PROBLEM
AND THEN THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER THE
EMPTY COFFIN
WHAT IS THAT EMPTY COFFIN ASKED JEAN VALJEAN
FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
THE COFFIN OF THE ADMINISTRATION
WHAT COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION
A NUN DIES
THE MUNICIPAL DOCTOR COMES AND SAYS 'A NUN HAS DIED
THE GOVERNMENT SENDS A COFFIN
THE NEXT DAY IT SENDS A HEARSE AND
UNDERTAKER'S MEN TO GET THE COFFIN AND CARRY IT TO THE CEMETERY
THE
UNDERTAKER'S MEN WILL COME AND LIFT THE COFFIN THERE WILL BE NOTHING IN
IT
PUT SOMETHING IN IT
A CORPSE I HAVE NONE
NO
WHAT THEN
A LIVING PERSON
WHAT PERSON
ME SAID JEAN VALJEAN
FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER
HIS CHAIR
YOU
WHY NOT
JEAN VALJEAN GAVE WAY TO ONE OF THOSE RARE SMILES WHICH LIGHTED UP HIS
FACE LIKE A FLASH FROM HEAVEN IN THE WINTER
YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID 'MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS
DEAD AND I ADD 'AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED
AH GOOD YOU CAN LAUGH YOU ARE NOT SPEAKING SERIOUSLY
VERY SERIOUSLY I MUST GET OUT OF THIS PLACE
CERTAINLY
L HAVE TOLD YOU TO FIND A BASKET AND A COVER FOR ME ALSO
WELL
THE BASKET WILL BE OF PINE AND THE COVER A BLACK CLOTH
IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WILL BE A WHITE CLOTH
NUNS ARE BURIED IN
WHITE
LET IT BE A WHITE CLOTH THEN
YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MADELEINE
TO BEHOLD SUCH DEVICES WHICH ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN THE SAVAGE AND
DARING INVENTIONS OF THE GALLEYS SPRING FORTH FROM THE PEACEABLE THINGS
WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AND MINGLE WITH WHAT HE CALLED THE PETTY COURSE
OF LIFE IN THE CONVENT CAUSED FAUCHELEVENT AS MUCH AMAZEMENT AS A
GULL FISHING IN THE GUTTER OF THE RUE SAINT DENIS WOULD INSPIRE IN A
PASSER BY
JEAN VALJEAN WENT ON
THE PROBLEM IS TO GET OUT OF HERE WITHOUT BEING SEEN
THIS OFFERS
THE MEANS
BUT GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
HOW IS IT
MANAGED WHERE IS THIS COFFIN
THE EMPTY ONE
YES
DOWN STAIRS IN WHAT IS CALLED THE DEAD ROOM
IT STANDS ON TWO
TRESTLES UNDER THE PALL
HOW LONG IS THE COFFIN
SIX FEET
WHAT IS THIS DEAD ROOM
IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING
ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO
DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH
WHAT CHURCH
THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THOSE TWO DOORS
NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE
PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
WHEN DOES THE PORTER OPEN THAT DOOR
ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE
COFFIN
WHEN THE COFFIN HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT THE DOOR IS CLOSED AGAIN
WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN
I DO
WHO SPREADS THE PALL OVER IT
I DO
ARE YOU ALONE
NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM
THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THAT ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP
NO
BUT I COULD HIDE YOU IN A SMALL DARK NOOK WHICH OPENS ON THE
DEAD ROOM WHERE I KEEP MY TOOLS TO USE FOR BURIALS AND OF WHICH I HAVE
THE KEY
AT WHAT TIME WILL THE HEARSE COME FOR THE COFFIN TO MORROW
ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
THE BURIAL WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE
VAUGIRARD CEMETERY A LITTLE BEFORE NIGHTFALL
IT IS NOT VERY NEAR
I WILL REMAIN CONCEALED IN YOUR TOOL CLOSET ALL NIGHT AND ALL THE
MORNING
AND HOW ABOUT FOOD I SHALL BE HUNGRY
I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING
YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE COFFIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS
BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS IN A PLANK
WHAT SEEMED UNPRECEDENTED TO FAUCHELEVENT WAS WE REPEAT A SIMPLE
MATTER TO JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS THAN
THIS
ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT
HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
THE PRISONER IS SUBJECT TO
FLIGHT AS THE SICK MAN IS SUBJECT TO A CRISIS WHICH SAVES OR KILLS HIM
AN ESCAPE IS A CURE
WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A
CURE TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE
OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS
NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT
DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
MOREOVER A COFFIN CONTAINING A LIVING BEING THAT CONVICT'S
EXPEDIENT IS ALSO AN IMPERIAL EXPEDIENT
IF WE ARE TO CREDIT THE MONK
AUSTIN CASTILLEJO THIS WAS THE MEANS EMPLOYED BY CHARLES THE FIFTH
DESIROUS OF SEEING THE PLOMBES FOR THE LAST TIME AFTER HIS ABDICATION
HE HAD HER BROUGHT INTO AND CARRIED OUT OF THE MONASTERY OF SAINT YUSTE
IN THIS MANNER
FAUCHELEVENT WHO HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF A LITTLE EXCLAIMED
BUT HOW WILL YOU MANAGE TO BREATHE
I WILL BREATHE
IN THAT BOX THE MERE THOUGHT OF IT SUFFOCATES ME
YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND
THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ON LOOSELY
GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE
AND JEAN VALJEAN ADDED
FATHER FAUCHELEVENT WE MUST COME TO A DECISION I MUST EITHER BE
CAUGHT HERE OR ACCEPT THIS ESCAPE THROUGH THE HEARSE
EVERY ONE HAS NOTICED THE TASTE WHICH CATS HAVE FOR PAUSING AND LOUNGING
BETWEEN THE TWO LEAVES OF A HALF SHUT DOOR
WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT
SAID TO A CAT DO COME IN THERE ARE MEN WHO WHEN AN INCIDENT STANDS
HALF OPEN BEFORE THEM HAVE THE SAME TENDENCY TO HALT IN INDECISION
BETWEEN TWO RESOLUTIONS AT THE RISK OF GETTING CRUSHED THROUGH THE
ABRUPT CLOSING OF THE ADVENTURE BY FATE
THE OVER PRUDENT CATS AS THEY
ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN
THE AUDACIOUS
FAUCHELEVENT WAS OF THIS HESITATING NATURE
BUT
JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
HE
GRUMBLED
WELL SINCE THERE IS NO OTHER MEANS
JEAN VALJEAN RESUMED
THE ONLY THING WHICH TROUBLES ME IS WHAT WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE
CEMETERY
THAT IS THE VERY POINT THAT IS NOT TROUBLESOME EXCLAIMED
FAUCHELEVENT
IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I
AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
THE GRAVE DIGGER IS A DRUNKARD
AND A FRIEND OF MINE
HE IS FATHER MESTIENNE
AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD
SCHOOL
THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE
GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WILL TAKE PLACE
THEY
WILL ARRIVE A LITTLE BEFORE DUSK THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR BEFORE THE
GATES OF THE CEMETERY ARE CLOSED
THE HEARSE WILL DRIVE DIRECTLY UP TO
THE GRAVE
I SHALL FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
I SHALL HAVE A HAMMER
A CHISEL AND SOME PINCERS IN MY POCKET
THE HEARSE HALTS THE
UNDERTAKER'S MEN KNOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
THE
PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY
WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
I AM LEFT ALONE WITH FATHER MESTIENNE
HE IS MY FRIEND I TELL YOU
ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL
EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
IF HE IS NOT DRUNK I SHALL
SAY TO HIM 'COME AND DRINK A BOUT WHILE THE BON COING THE GOOD QUINCE
IS OPEN I CARRY HIM OFF I GET HIM DRUNK IT DOES NOT TAKE LONG TO
MAKE FATHER MESTIENNE DRUNK HE ALWAYS HAS THE BEGINNING OF IT ABOUT
HIM I LAY HIM UNDER THE TABLE I TAKE HIS CARD SO THAT I CAN GET INTO
THE CEMETERY AGAIN AND I RETURN WITHOUT HIM
THEN YOU HAVE NO LONGER
ANY ONE BUT ME TO DEAL WITH
IF HE IS DRUNK I SHALL SAY TO HIM 'BE
OFF I WILL DO YOUR WORK FOR YOU OFF HE GOES AND I DRAG YOU OUT OF
THE HOLE
JEAN VALJEAN HELD OUT HIS HAND AND FAUCHELEVENT PRECIPITATED HIMSELF
UPON IT WITH THE TOUCHING EFFUSION OF A PEASANT
THAT IS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT
ALL WILL GO WELL
PROVIDED NOTHING GOES WRONG THOUGHT FAUCHELEVENT
IN THAT CASE IT
WOULD BE TERRIBLE
CHAPTER V IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTAL
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY
ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAINE PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED
HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
THIS HEARSE
CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE
BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
A MOURNING COACH IN
WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED
CAP FOLLOWED
TWO UNDERTAKER'S MEN IN GRAY UNIFORMS TRIMMED WITH BLACK
WALKED ON THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT OF THE HEARSE
BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD
MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG
THE PROCESSION WAS
GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VAUGIRARD CEMETERY
THE HANDLE OF A HAMMER THE BLADE OF A COLD CHISEL AND THE ANTENNAE OF
A PAIR OF PINCERS WERE VISIBLE PROTRUDING FROM THE MAN'S POCKET
THE VAUGIRARD CEMETERY FORMED AN EXCEPTION AMONG THE CEMETERIES OF
PARIS
IT HAD ITS PECULIAR USAGES JUST AS IT HAD ITS CARRIAGE
ENTRANCE AND ITS HOUSE DOOR WHICH OLD PEOPLE IN THE QUARTER WHO CLUNG
TENACIOUSLY TO ANCIENT WORDS STILL CALLED THE PORTE CAVALIERE AND THE
PORTE PIETONNE 16 THE BERNARDINES BENEDICTINES OF THE RUE PETIT PICPUS
HAD OBTAINED PERMISSION AS WE HAVE ALREADY STATED TO BE BURIED THERE
IN A CORNER APART AND AT NIGHT THE PLOT OF LAND HAVING FORMERLY
BELONGED TO THEIR COMMUNITY
THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO
SERVICE IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS
CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
THE GATES OF THE
PARIS CEMETERIES CLOSED AT THAT EPOCH AT SUNDOWN AND THIS BEING A
MUNICIPAL REGULATION THE VAUGIRARD CEMETERY WAS BOUND BY IT LIKE THE
REST
THE CARRIAGE GATE AND THE HOUSE DOOR WERE TWO CONTIGUOUS GRATED
GATES ADJOINING A PAVILION BUILT BY THE ARCHITECT PERRONET AND
INHABITED BY THE DOOR KEEPER OF THE CEMETERY
THESE GATES THEREFORE
SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED
BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
IF ANY GRAVE DIGGER WERE DELAYED
AFTER THAT MOMENT IN THE CEMETERY THERE WAS BUT ONE WAY FOR HIM TO
GET OUT HIS GRAVE DIGGER'S CARD FURNISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
FUNERALS
A SORT OF LETTER BOX WAS CONSTRUCTED IN THE PORTER'S WINDOW
THE GRAVE DIGGER DROPPED HIS CARD INTO THIS BOX THE PORTER HEARD IT
FALL PULLED THE ROPE AND THE SMALL DOOR OPENED
IF THE MAN HAD NOT HIS
CARD HE MENTIONED HIS NAME THE PORTER WHO WAS SOMETIMES IN BED AND
ASLEEP ROSE CAME OUT AND IDENTIFIED THE MAN AND OPENED THE GATE WITH
HIS KEY THE GRAVE DIGGER STEPPED OUT BUT HAD TO PAY A FINE OF FIFTEEN
FRANCS
THIS CEMETERY WITH ITS PECULIARITIES OUTSIDE THE REGULATIONS
EMBARRASSED THE SYMMETRY OF THE ADMINISTRATION
IT WAS SUPPRESSED
A LITTLE LATER THAN 1830
THE CEMETERY OF MONT PARNASSE CALLED THE
EASTERN CEMETERY SUCCEEDED TO IT AND INHERITED THAT FAMOUS DRAM SHOP
NEXT TO THE VAUGIRARD CEMETERY WHICH WAS SURMOUNTED BY A QUINCE PAINTED
ON A BOARD AND WHICH FORMED AN ANGLE ONE SIDE ON THE DRINKERS' TABLES
AND THE OTHER ON THE TOMBS WITH THIS SIGN AU BON COING
THE VAUGIRARD CEMETERY WAS WHAT MAY BE CALLED A FADED CEMETERY
IT
WAS FALLING INTO DISUSE
DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE
DESERTING IT
THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN
THE VAUGIRARD IT HINTED AT POVERTY
PERE LACHAISE IF YOU PLEASE TO BE
BURIED IN PERE LACHAISE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY
IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
THE VAUGIRARD CEMETERY WAS A VENERABLE
ENCLOSURE PLANTED LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED FRENCH GARDEN
STRAIGHT ALLEYS
BOX THUYA TREES HOLLY ANCIENT TOMBS BENEATH AGED CYPRESS TREES AND
VERY TALL GRASS
IN THE EVENING IT WAS TRAGIC THERE
THERE WERE VERY
LUGUBRIOUS LINES ABOUT IT
THE SUN HAD NOT YET SET WHEN THE HEARSE WITH THE WHITE PALL AND THE
BLACK CROSS ENTERED THE AVENUE OF THE VAUGIRARD CEMETERY
THE LAME MAN
WHO FOLLOWED IT WAS NO OTHER THAN FAUCHELEVENT
THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE
EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN TO THE DEAD ROOM ALL
HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH
LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER
THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT
IT
IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY
THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED IT
NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN
CONSCIENCES
IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY
AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS
QUESTIONABLE
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE RULE AS FOR THE CODE WE SHALL
SEE
MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
THE TRIBUTE TO CAESAR IS NEVER ANYTHING BUT THE REMNANTS OF THE TRIBUTE
TO GOD
A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPLE
FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME
OF MIND
HIS TWIN PLOTS THE ONE WITH THE NUNS THE ONE FOR THE CONVENT
THE OTHER AGAINST IT THE OTHER WITH M
MADELEINE HAD SUCCEEDED TO
ALL APPEARANCE
JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL
TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
FAUCHELEVENT NO LONGER FELT
DOUBTFUL AS TO HIS SUCCESS
WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING
WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS
HE HAD MADE GOOD FATHER MESTIENNE A CHUBBY CHEEKED PERSON DRUNK AT
LEAST TEN TIMES
HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESTIENNE
HE DID WHAT HE LIKED
WITH HIM
HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
MESTIENNE'S HEAD
ADJUSTED ITSELF TO THE CAP OF FAUCHELEVENT'S WILL
FAUCHELEVENT'S
CONFIDENCE WAS PERFECT
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE CONVOY ENTERED THE AVENUE LEADING TO THE
CEMETERY FAUCHELEVENT GLANCED CHEERFULLY AT THE HEARSE AND SAID HALF
ALOUD AS HE RUBBED HIS BIG HANDS
HERE'S A FINE FARCE
ALL AT ONCE THE HEARSE HALTED IT HAD REACHED THE GATE
THE PERMISSION
FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
THE UNDERTAKER'S MAN ADDRESSED HIMSELF
TO THE PORTER OF THE CEMETERY
DURING THIS COLLOQUY WHICH ALWAYS IS
PRODUCTIVE OF A DELAY OF FROM ONE TO TWO MINUTES SOME ONE A STRANGER
CAME AND PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE HEARSE BESIDE FAUCHELEVENT
HE WAS
A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND
CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
FAUCHELEVENT SURVEYED THIS STRANGER
WHO ARE YOU HE DEMANDED
THE MAN REPLIED
THE GRAVE DIGGER
IF A MAN COULD SURVIVE THE BLOW OF A CANNON BALL FULL IN THE BREAST HE
WOULD MAKE THE SAME FACE THAT FAUCHELEVENT MADE
THE GRAVE DIGGER
YES
YOU
I
FATHER MESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
HE WAS
WHAT HE WAS
HE IS DEAD
FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS THAT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD
DIE
IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE THEMSELVES
BY
DINT OF EXCAVATING GRAVES FOR OTHER PEOPLE ONE HOLLOWS OUT ONE'S OWN
FAUCHELEVENT STOOD THERE WITH HIS MOUTH WIDE OPEN
HE HAD HARDLY THE
STRENGTH TO STAMMER
BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE
IT IS SO
BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
AFTER NAPOLEON LOUIS XVIII
AFTER MESTIENNE GRIBIER
PEASANT MY NAME
IS GRIBIER
FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS DEADLY PALE STARED AT THIS GRIBIER
HE WAS A TALL THIN LIVID UTTERLY FUNEREAL MAN
HE HAD THE AIR OF AN
UNSUCCESSFUL DOCTOR WHO HAD TURNED GRAVE DIGGER
FAUCHELEVENT BURST OUT LAUGHING
AH SAID HE WHAT QUEER THINGS DO HAPPEN FATHER MESTIENNE IS DEAD
BUT LONG LIVE LITTLE FATHER LENOIR DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LENOIR
IS HE IS A JUG OF RED WINE
IT IS A JUG OF SURENE MORBIGOU OF REAL
PARIS SURENE AH SO OLD MESTIENNE IS DEAD I AM SORRY FOR IT HE WAS
A JOLLY FELLOW
BUT YOU ARE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
ARE YOU NOT COMRADE
WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
THE MAN REPLIED
I HAVE BEEN A STUDENT
I PASSED MY FOURTH EXAMINATION
I NEVER DRINK
THE HEARSE HAD SET OUT AGAIN AND WAS ROLLING UP THE GRAND ALLEY OF THE
CEMETERY
FAUCHELEVENT HAD SLACKENED HIS PACE
HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN
FROM INFIRMITY
THE GRAVE DIGGER WALKED ON IN FRONT OF HIM
FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED GRIBIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO THOUGH VERY YOUNG HAVE THE AIR OF AGE AND
WHO THOUGH SLENDER ARE EXTREMELY STRONG
COMRADE CRIED FAUCHELEVENT
THE MAN TURNED ROUND
I AM THE CONVENT GRAVE DIGGER
MY COLLEAGUE SAID THE MAN
FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE
HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER
HE
MUTTERED
SO FATHER MESTIENNE IS DEAD
THE MAN REPLIED
COMPLETELY
THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTE BOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE
TIME IS UP
IT WAS FATHER MESTIENNE'S TURN
FATHER MESTIENNE DIED
FAUCHELEVENT REPEATED MECHANICALLY THE GOOD GOD
THE GOOD GOD SAID THE MAN AUTHORITATIVELY
ACCORDING TO THE
PHILOSOPHERS THE ETERNAL FATHER ACCORDING TO THE JACOBINS THE SUPREME
BEING
SHALL WE NOT MAKE EACH OTHER'S ACQUAINTANCE STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT
IT IS MADE
YOU ARE A PEASANT I AM A PARISIAN
PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY HAVE DRUNK TOGETHER
HE WHO
EMPTIES HIS GLASS EMPTIES HIS HEART
YOU MUST COME AND HAVE A DRINK WITH
ME
SUCH A THING CANNOT BE REFUSED
BUSINESS FIRST
FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT I AM LOST
THEY WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY
LEADING TO THE NUNS' CORNER
THE GRAVE DIGGER RESUMED
PEASANT I HAVE SEVEN SMALL CHILDREN WHO MUST BE FED
AS THEY MUST EAT
I CANNOT DRINK
AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A
PHRASE WELL
THEIR HUNGER IS THE ENEMY OF MY THIRST
THE HEARSE SKIRTED A CLUMP OF CYPRESS TREES QUITTED THE GRAND ALLEY
TURNED INTO A NARROW ONE ENTERED THE WASTE LAND AND PLUNGED INTO
A THICKET
THIS INDICATED THE IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY OF THE PLACE OF
SEPULTURE
FAUCHELEVENT SLACKENED HIS PACE BUT HE COULD NOT DETAIN THE
HEARSE
FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER
RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
HE APPROACHED THE GRAVE DIGGER
THEY HAVE SUCH A NICE LITTLE ARGENTEUIL WINE MURMURED FAUCHELEVENT
VILLAGER RETORTED THE MAN I OUGHT NOT BE A GRAVE DIGGER
MY
FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRYTANEUM TOWN HALL
HE DESTINED ME FOR
LITERATURE
BUT HE HAD REVERSES
HE HAD LOSSES ON 'CHANGE
I WAS OBLIGED
TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR
BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
SO YOU ARE NOT A GRAVE DIGGER THEN RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING
AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
THE ONE DOES NOT HINDER THE OTHER
I CUMULATE
FAUCHELEVENT DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS LAST WORD
COME HAVE A DRINK SAID HE
HERE A REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH
OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO
PAY GENERALLY FAUCHELEVENT OFFERED AND FATHER MESTIENNE PAID
AN OFFER
OF A DRINK WAS THE EVIDENT RESULT OF THE NOVEL SITUATION CREATED BY THE
NEW GRAVE DIGGER AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE THIS OFFER BUT THE OLD
GARDENER LEFT THE PROVERBIAL QUARTER OF AN HOUR NAMED AFTER RABELAIS IN
THE DARK AND THAT NOT UNINTENTIONALLY
AS FOR HIMSELF FAUCHELEVENT DID
NOT WISH TO PAY TROUBLED AS HE WAS
THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
ONE MUST EAT
I HAVE ACCEPTED FATHER MESTIENNE'S REVERSION
ONE GETS TO
BE A PHILOSOPHER WHEN ONE HAS NEARLY COMPLETED HIS CLASSES
TO THE LABOR
OF THE HAND I JOIN THE LABOR OF THE ARM
I HAVE MY SCRIVENER'S STALL IN
THE MARKET OF THE RUE DE SEVRES
YOU KNOW THE UMBRELLA MARKET
ALL THE
COOKS OF THE RED CROSS APPLY TO ME
I SCRIBBLE THEIR DECLARATIONS OF
LOVE TO THE RAW SOLDIERS
IN THE MORNING I WRITE LOVE LETTERS IN THE
EVENING I DIG GRAVES
SUCH IS LIFE RUSTIC
THE HEARSE WAS STILL ADVANCING
FAUCHELEVENT UNEASY TO THE LAST DEGREE
WAS GAZING ABOUT HIM ON ALL SIDES
GREAT DROPS OF PERSPIRATION TRICKLED
DOWN FROM HIS BROW
BUT CONTINUED THE GRAVE DIGGER A MAN CANNOT SERVE TWO MISTRESSES
I MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN THE PEN AND THE MATTOCK
THE MATTOCK IS RUINING MY
HAND
THE HEARSE HALTED
THE CHOIR BOY ALIGHTED FROM THE MOURNING COACH THEN THE PRIEST
ONE OF THE SMALL FRONT WHEELS OF THE HEARSE HAD RUN UP A LITTLE ON A
PILE OF EARTH BEYOND WHICH AN OPEN GRAVE WAS VISIBLE
WHAT A FARCE THIS IS REPEATED FAUCHELEVENT IN CONSTERNATION
CHAPTER VI BETWEEN FOUR PLANKS
WHO WAS IN THE COFFIN THE READER KNOWS
JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN HAD ARRANGED THINGS SO THAT HE COULD EXIST THERE AND HE
COULD ALMOST BREATHE
IT IS A STRANGE THING TO WHAT A DEGREE SECURITY OF CONSCIENCE CONFERS
SECURITY OF THE REST
EVERY COMBINATION THOUGHT OUT BY JEAN VALJEAN HAD
BEEN PROGRESSING AND PROGRESSING FAVORABLY SINCE THE PRECEDING DAY
HE LIKE FAUCHELEVENT COUNTED ON FATHER MESTIENNE
HE HAD NO DOUBT
AS TO THE END
NEVER WAS THERE A MORE CRITICAL SITUATION NEVER MORE
COMPLETE COMPOSURE
THE FOUR PLANKS OF THE COFFIN BREATHE OUT A KIND OF TERRIBLE PEACE
IT
SEEMED AS THOUGH SOMETHING OF THE REPOSE OF THE DEAD ENTERED INTO JEAN
VALJEAN'S TRANQUILLITY
FROM THE DEPTHS OF THAT COFFIN HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FOLLOW AND HE HAD
FOLLOWED ALL THE PHASES OF THE TERRIBLE DRAMA WHICH HE WAS PLAYING WITH
DEATH
SHORTLY AFTER FAUCHELEVENT HAD FINISHED NAILING ON THE UPPER PLANK JEAN
VALJEAN HAD FELT HIMSELF CARRIED OUT THEN DRIVEN OFF
HE KNEW FROM THE
DIMINUTION IN THE JOLTING WHEN THEY LEFT THE PAVEMENTS AND REACHED THE
EARTH ROAD
HE HAD DIVINED FROM A DULL NOISE THAT THEY WERE CROSSING
THE BRIDGE OF AUSTERLITZ
AT THE FIRST HALT HE HAD UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY
WERE ENTERING THE CEMETERY AT THE SECOND HALT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
HERE IS THE GRAVE
SUDDENLY HE FELT HANDS SEIZE THE COFFIN THEN A HARSH GRATING AGAINST
THE PLANKS HE EXPLAINED IT TO HIMSELF AS THE ROPE WHICH WAS BEING
FASTENED ROUND THE CASKET IN ORDER TO LOWER IT INTO THE CAVITY
THEN HE EXPERIENCED A GIDDINESS
THE UNDERTAKER'S MAN AND THE GRAVE DIGGER HAD PROBABLY ALLOWED THE
COFFIN TO LOSE ITS BALANCE AND HAD LOWERED THE HEAD BEFORE THE FOOT
HE
RECOVERED HIMSELF FULLY WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF HORIZONTAL AND MOTIONLESS
HE HAD JUST TOUCHED THE BOTTOM
HE HAD A CERTAIN SENSATION OF COLD
A VOICE ROSE ABOVE HIM GLACIAL AND SOLEMN
HE HEARD LATIN WORDS WHICH
HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND PASS OVER HIM SO SLOWLY THAT HE WAS ABLE TO
CATCH THEM ONE BY ONE
QUI DORMIUNT IN TERRAE PULVERE EVIGILABUNT ALII IN VITAM AETERNAM ET
ALII IN APPROBRIUM UT VIDEANT SEMPER
A CHILD'S VOICE SAID
DE PROFUNDIS
THE GRAVE VOICE BEGAN AGAIN
REQUIEM AETERNAM DONA EI DOMINE
THE CHILD'S VOICE RESPONDED
ET LUX PERPETUA LUCEAT EI
HE HEARD SOMETHING LIKE THE GENTLE PATTER OF SEVERAL DROPS OF RAIN ON
THE PLANK WHICH COVERED HIM
IT WAS PROBABLY THE HOLY WATER
HE THOUGHT THIS WILL BE OVER SOON NOW
PATIENCE FOR A LITTLE WHILE
LONGER
THE PRIEST WILL TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
FAUCHELEVENT WILL TAKE
MESTIENNE OFF TO DRINK
I SHALL BE LEFT
THEN FAUCHELEVENT WILL RETURN
ALONE AND I SHALL GET OUT
THAT WILL BE THE WORK OF A GOOD HOUR
THE GRAVE VOICE RESUMED
REQUIESCAT IN PACE
AND THE CHILD'S VOICE SAID
AMEN
JEAN VALJEAN STRAINED HIS EARS AND HEARD SOMETHING LIKE RETREATING
FOOTSTEPS
THERE THEY ARE GOING NOW THOUGHT HE
I AM ALONE
ALL AT ONCE HE HEARD OVER HIS HEAD A SOUND WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TO BE A
CLAP OF THUNDER
IT WAS A SHOVELFUL OF EARTH FALLING ON THE COFFIN
A SECOND SHOVELFUL FELL
ONE OF THE HOLES THROUGH WHICH HE BREATHED HAD JUST BEEN STOPPED UP
A THIRD SHOVELFUL OF EARTH FELL
THEN A FOURTH
THERE ARE THINGS WHICH ARE TOO STRONG FOR THE STRONGEST MAN
JEAN
VALJEAN LOST CONSCIOUSNESS
CHAPTER VII IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE ORIGIN OF THE SAYING DON'T LOSE
THE CARD
THIS IS WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE ABOVE THE COFFIN IN WHICH LAY JEAN VALJEAN
WHEN THE HEARSE HAD DRIVEN OFF WHEN THE PRIEST AND THE CHOIR BOY HAD
ENTERED THE CARRIAGE AGAIN AND TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE FAUCHELEVENT WHO
HAD NOT TAKEN HIS EYES FROM THE GRAVE DIGGER SAW THE LATTER BEND OVER
AND GRASP HIS SHOVEL WHICH WAS STICKING UPRIGHT IN THE HEAP OF DIRT
THEN FAUCHELEVENT TOOK A SUPREME RESOLVE
HE PLACED HIMSELF BETWEEN THE GRAVE AND THE GRAVE DIGGER CROSSED HIS
ARMS AND SAID
I AM THE ONE TO PAY
THE GRAVE DIGGER STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT AND REPLIED
WHAT'S THAT PEASANT
FAUCHELEVENT REPEATED
I AM THE ONE WHO PAYS
WHAT
FOR THE WINE
WHAT WINE
THAT ARGENTEUIL WINE
WHERE IS THE ARGENTEUIL
AT THE BON COING
GO TO THE DEVIL SAID THE GRAVE DIGGER
AND HE FLUNG A SHOVELFUL OF EARTH ON THE COFFIN
THE COFFIN GAVE BACK A HOLLOW SOUND
FAUCHELEVENT FELT HIMSELF STAGGER
AND ON THE POINT OF FALLING HEADLONG INTO THE GRAVE HIMSELF
HE SHOUTED
IN A VOICE IN WHICH THE STRANGLING SOUND OF THE DEATH RATTLE BEGAN TO
MINGLE
COMRADE BEFORE THE BON COING IS SHUT
THE GRAVE DIGGER TOOK SOME MORE EARTH ON HIS SHOVEL
FAUCHELEVENT
CONTINUED
I WILL PAY
AND HE SEIZED THE MAN'S ARM
LISTEN TO ME COMRADE
I AM THE CONVENT GRAVE DIGGER I HAVE COME
TO HELP YOU
IT IS A BUSINESS WHICH CAN BE PERFORMED AT NIGHT
LET US
BEGIN THEN BY GOING FOR A DRINK
AND AS HE SPOKE AND CLUNG TO THIS DESPERATE INSISTENCE THIS MELANCHOLY
REFLECTION OCCURRED TO HIM AND IF HE DRINKS WILL HE GET DRUNK
PROVINCIAL SAID THE MAN IF YOU POSITIVELY INSIST UPON IT I
CONSENT
WE WILL DRINK
AFTER WORK NEVER BEFORE
AND HE FLOURISHED HIS SHOVEL BRISKLY
FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIM BACK
IT IS ARGENTEUIL WINE AT SIX
OH COME SAID THE GRAVE DIGGER YOU ARE A BELL RINGER
DING DONG
DING DONG THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW HOW TO SAY
GO HANG YOURSELF
AND HE THREW IN A SECOND SHOVELFUL
FAUCHELEVENT HAD REACHED A POINT WHERE HE NO LONGER KNEW WHAT HE WAS
SAYING
COME ALONG AND DRINK HE CRIED SINCE IT IS I WHO PAYS THE BILL
WHEN WE HAVE PUT THE CHILD TO BED SAID THE GRAVE DIGGER
HE FLUNG IN A THIRD SHOVELFUL
THEN HE THRUST HIS SHOVEL INTO THE EARTH AND ADDED
IT'S COLD TO NIGHT YOU SEE AND THE CORPSE WOULD SHRIEK OUT AFTER US
IF WE WERE TO PLANT HER THERE WITHOUT A COVERLET
AT THAT MOMENT AS HE LOADED HIS SHOVEL THE GRAVE DIGGER BENT OVER
AND THE POCKET OF HIS WAISTCOAT GAPED
FAUCHELEVENT'S WILD GAZE FELL
MECHANICALLY INTO THAT POCKET AND THERE IT STOPPED
THE SUN WAS NOT YET HIDDEN BEHIND THE HORIZON THERE WAS STILL LIGHT
ENOUGH TO ENABLE HIM TO DISTINGUISH SOMETHING WHITE AT THE BOTTOM OF
THAT YAWNING POCKET
THE SUM TOTAL OF LIGHTNING THAT THE EYE OF A PICARD PEASANT CAN CONTAIN
TRAVERSED FAUCHELEVENT'S PUPILS
AN IDEA HAD JUST OCCURRED TO HIM
HE THRUST HIS HAND INTO THE POCKET FROM BEHIND WITHOUT THE
GRAVE DIGGER WHO WAS WHOLLY ABSORBED IN HIS SHOVELFUL OF EARTH
OBSERVING IT AND PULLED OUT THE WHITE OBJECT WHICH LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF
IT
THE MAN SENT A FOURTH SHOVELFUL TUMBLING INTO THE GRAVE
JUST AS HE TURNED ROUND TO GET THE FIFTH FAUCHELEVENT LOOKED CALMLY AT
HIM AND SAID
BY THE WAY YOU NEW MAN HAVE YOU YOUR CARD
THE GRAVE DIGGER PAUSED
WHAT CARD
THE SUN IS ON THE POINT OF SETTING
THAT'S GOOD IT IS GOING TO PUT ON ITS NIGHTCAP
THE GATE OF THE CEMETERY WILL CLOSE IMMEDIATELY
WELL WHAT THEN
HAVE YOU YOUR CARD
AH MY CARD SAID THE GRAVE DIGGER
AND HE FUMBLED IN HIS POCKET
HAVING SEARCHED ONE POCKET HE PROCEEDED TO SEARCH THE OTHER
HE PASSED
ON TO HIS FOBS EXPLORED THE FIRST RETURNED TO THE SECOND
WHY NO SAID HE I HAVE NOT MY CARD
I MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN IT
FIFTEEN FRANCS FINE SAID FAUCHELEVENT
THE GRAVE DIGGER TURNED GREEN
GREEN IS THE PALLOR OF LIVID PEOPLE
AH JESUS MON DIEU BANCROCHE A BAS LA LUNE 17 HE EXCLAIMED
FIFTEEN
FRANCS FINE
THREE PIECES OF A HUNDRED SOUS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
THE GRAVE DIGGER DROPPED HIS SHOVEL
FAUCHELEVENT'S TURN HAD COME
AH COME NOW CONSCRIPT SAID FAUCHELEVENT NONE OF THIS DESPAIR
THERE IS NO QUESTION OF COMMITTING SUICIDE AND BENEFITING THE GRAVE
FIFTEEN FRANCS IS FIFTEEN FRANCS AND BESIDES YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
PAY IT
I AM AN OLD HAND YOU ARE A NEW ONE
I KNOW ALL THE ROPES AND
THE DEVICES
I WILL GIVE YOU SOME FRIENDLY ADVICE
ONE THING IS CLEAR
THE SUN IS ON THE POINT OF SETTING IT IS TOUCHING THE DOME NOW THE
CEMETERY WILL BE CLOSED IN FIVE MINUTES MORE
THAT IS TRUE REPLIED THE MAN
FIVE MINUTES MORE AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE TIME TO FILL THE GRAVE IT IS
AS HOLLOW AS THE DEVIL THIS GRAVE AND TO REACH THE GATE IN SEASON TO
PASS IT BEFORE IT IS SHUT
THAT IS TRUE
IN THAT CASE A FINE OF FIFTEEN FRANCS
FIFTEEN FRANCS
BUT YOU HAVE TIME
WHERE DO YOU LIVE
A COUPLE OF STEPS FROM THE BARRIER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FROM HERE
NO
87 RUE DE VAUGIRARD
YOU HAVE JUST TIME TO GET OUT BY TAKING TO YOUR HEELS AT YOUR BEST
SPEED
THAT IS EXACTLY SO
ONCE OUTSIDE THE GATE YOU GALLOP HOME YOU GET YOUR CARD YOU RETURN
THE CEMETERY PORTER ADMITS YOU
AS YOU HAVE YOUR CARD THERE WILL BE
NOTHING TO PAY
AND YOU WILL BURY YOUR CORPSE
I'LL WATCH IT FOR YOU IN
THE MEANTIME SO THAT IT SHALL NOT RUN AWAY
I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE PEASANT
DECAMP SAID FAUCHELEVENT
THE GRAVE DIGGER OVERWHELMED WITH GRATITUDE SHOOK HIS HAND AND SET OFF
ON A RUN
WHEN THE MAN HAD DISAPPEARED IN THE THICKET FAUCHELEVENT LISTENED UNTIL
HE HEARD HIS FOOTSTEPS DIE AWAY IN THE DISTANCE THEN HE LEANED OVER THE
GRAVE AND SAID IN A LOW TONE
FATHER MADELEINE
THERE WAS NO REPLY
FAUCHELEVENT WAS SEIZED WITH A SHUDDER
HE TUMBLED RATHER THAN CLIMBED
INTO THE GRAVE FLUNG HIMSELF ON THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN AND CRIED
ARE YOU THERE
SILENCE IN THE COFFIN
FAUCHELEVENT HARDLY ABLE TO DRAW HIS BREATH FOR TREMBLING SEIZED HIS
COLD CHISEL AND HIS HAMMER AND PRIED UP THE COFFIN LID
JEAN VALJEAN'S FACE APPEARED IN THE TWILIGHT IT WAS PALE AND HIS EYES
WERE CLOSED
FAUCHELEVENT'S HAIR ROSE UPRIGHT ON HIS HEAD HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET
THEN FELL BACK AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE READY TO SWOON ON THE
COFFIN
HE STARED AT JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN LAY THERE PALLID AND MOTIONLESS
FAUCHELEVENT MURMURED IN A VOICE AS FAINT AS A SIGH
HE IS DEAD
AND DRAWING HIMSELF UP AND FOLDING HIS ARMS WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT
HIS CLENCHED FISTS CAME IN CONTACT WITH HIS SHOULDERS HE CRIED
AND THIS IS THE WAY I SAVE HIS LIFE
THEN THE POOR MAN FELL TO SOBBING
HE SOLILOQUIZED THE WHILE FOR IT IS
AN ERROR TO SUPPOSE THAT THE SOLILOQUY IS UNNATURAL
POWERFUL EMOTION
OFTEN TALKS ALOUD
IT IS FATHER MESTIENNE'S FAULT
WHY DID THAT FOOL DIE WHAT NEED WAS
THERE FOR HIM TO GIVE UP THE GHOST AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN NO ONE WAS
EXPECTING IT IT IS HE WHO HAS KILLED M
MADELEINE
FATHER MADELEINE
HE IS IN THE COFFIN
IT IS QUITE HANDY
ALL IS OVER
NOW IS THERE ANY
SENSE IN THESE THINGS AH MY GOD HE IS DEAD WELL AND HIS LITTLE
GIRL WHAT AM I TO DO WITH HER WHAT WILL THE FRUIT SELLER SAY THE IDEA
OF ITS BEING POSSIBLE FOR A MAN LIKE THAT TO DIE LIKE THIS WHEN I THINK
HOW HE PUT HIMSELF UNDER THAT CART FATHER MADELEINE FATHER MADELEINE
PARDINE HE WAS SUFFOCATED I SAID SO
HE WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME
WELL
HERE'S A PRETTY TRICK TO PLAY HE IS DEAD THAT GOOD MAN THE VERY BEST
MAN OUT OF ALL THE GOOD GOD'S GOOD FOLKS AND HIS LITTLE GIRL AH IN
THE FIRST PLACE I WON'T GO BACK THERE MYSELF
I SHALL STAY HERE
AFTER
HAVING DONE SUCH A THING AS THAT WHAT'S THE USE OF BEING TWO OLD MEN
IF WE ARE TWO OLD FOOLS BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE HOW DID HE MANAGE TO
ENTER THE CONVENT THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL
ONE SHOULD NOT
DO SUCH THINGS
FATHER MADELEINE FATHER MADELEINE FATHER MADELEINE
MADELEINE MONSIEUR MADELEINE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE HE DOES NOT HEAR ME
NOW GET OUT OF THIS SCRAPE IF YOU CAN
AND HE TORE HIS HAIR
A GRATING SOUND BECAME AUDIBLE THROUGH THE TREES IN THE DISTANCE
IT WAS
THE CEMETERY GATE CLOSING
FAUCHELEVENT BENT OVER JEAN VALJEAN AND ALL AT ONCE HE BOUNDED BACK AND
RECOILED SO FAR AS THE LIMITS OF A GRAVE PERMIT
JEAN VALJEAN'S EYES WERE OPEN AND GAZING AT HIM
TO SEE A CORPSE IS ALARMING TO BEHOLD A RESURRECTION IS ALMOST AS MUCH
SO
FAUCHELEVENT BECAME LIKE STONE PALE HAGGARD OVERWHELMED BY ALL
THESE EXCESSES OF EMOTION NOT KNOWING WHETHER HE HAD TO DO WITH A
LIVING MAN OR A DEAD ONE AND STARING AT JEAN VALJEAN WHO WAS GAZING AT
HIM
ILLUSTRATION THE RESURRECTION 2B8 7 RESURRECTION
I FELL ASLEEP SAID JEAN VALJEAN
AND HE RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSTURE
FAUCHELEVENT FELL ON HIS KNEES
JUST GOOD VIRGIN HOW YOU FRIGHTENED ME
THEN HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND CRIED
THANKS FATHER MADELEINE
JEAN VALJEAN HAD MERELY FAINTED
THE FRESH AIR HAD REVIVED HIM
JOY IS THE EBB OF TERROR
FAUCHELEVENT FOUND ALMOST AS MUCH DIFFICULTY
IN RECOVERING HIMSELF AS JEAN VALJEAN HAD
SO YOU ARE NOT DEAD OH HOW WISE YOU ARE I CALLED YOU SO MUCH THAT
YOU CAME BACK
WHEN I SAW YOUR EYES SHUT I SAID 'GOOD THERE HE IS
STIFLED I SHOULD HAVE GONE RAVING MAD MAD ENOUGH FOR A STRAIT JACKET
THEY WOULD HAVE PUT ME IN BICETRE
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE I SHOULD
HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD BEEN DEAD AND YOUR LITTLE GIRL THERE'S THAT
FRUIT SELLER SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT THE CHILD IS THRUST
INTO YOUR ARMS AND THEN THE GRANDFATHER IS DEAD WHAT A STORY GOOD
SAINTS OF PARADISE WHAT A TALE AH YOU ARE ALIVE THAT'S THE BEST OF
IT
I AM COLD SAID JEAN VALJEAN
THIS REMARK RECALLED FAUCHELEVENT THOROUGHLY TO REALITY AND THERE WAS
PRESSING NEED OF IT
THE SOULS OF THESE TWO MEN WERE TROUBLED EVEN WHEN
THEY HAD RECOVERED THEMSELVES ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT REALIZE IT
AND THERE WAS ABOUT THEM SOMETHING UNCANNY WHICH WAS THE SINISTER
BEWILDERMENT INSPIRED BY THE PLACE
LET US GET OUT OF HERE QUICKLY EXCLAIMED FAUCHELEVENT
HE FUMBLED IN HIS POCKET AND PULLED OUT A GOURD WITH WHICH HE HAD
PROVIDED HIMSELF
BUT FIRST TAKE A DROP SAID HE
THE FLASK FINISHED WHAT THE FRESH AIR HAD BEGUN JEAN VALJEAN SWALLOWED
A MOUTHFUL OF BRANDY AND REGAINED FULL POSSESSION OF HIS FACULTIES
HE GOT OUT OF THE COFFIN AND HELPED FAUCHELEVENT TO NAIL ON THE LID
AGAIN
THREE MINUTES LATER THEY WERE OUT OF THE GRAVE
MOREOVER FAUCHELEVENT WAS PERFECTLY COMPOSED
HE TOOK HIS TIME
THE
CEMETERY WAS CLOSED
THE ARRIVAL OF THE GRAVE DIGGER GRIBIER WAS NOT TO
BE APPREHENDED
THAT CONSCRIPT WAS AT HOME BUSILY ENGAGED IN LOOKING
FOR HIS CARD AND AT SOME DIFFICULTY IN FINDING IT IN HIS LODGINGS
SINCE IT WAS IN FAUCHELEVENT'S POCKET
WITHOUT A CARD HE COULD NOT GET
BACK INTO THE CEMETERY
FAUCHELEVENT TOOK THE SHOVEL AND JEAN VALJEAN THE PICK AXE AND
TOGETHER THEY BURIED THE EMPTY COFFIN
WHEN THE GRAVE WAS FULL FAUCHELEVENT SAID TO JEAN VALJEAN
LET US GO
I WILL KEEP THE SHOVEL DO YOU CARRY OFF THE MATTOCK
NIGHT WAS FALLING
JEAN VALJEAN EXPERIENCED ROME DIFFICULTY IN MOVING AND IN WALKING
HE
HAD STIFFENED HIMSELF IN THAT COFFIN AND HAD BECOME A LITTLE LIKE A
CORPSE
THE RIGIDITY OF DEATH HAD SEIZED UPON HIM BETWEEN THOSE FOUR
PLANKS
HE HAD IN A MANNER TO THAW OUT FROM THE TOMB
YOU ARE BENUMBED SAID FAUCHELEVENT
IT IS A PITY THAT I HAVE A GAME
LEG FOR OTHERWISE WE MIGHT STEP OUT BRISKLY
BAH REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN FOUR PACES WILL PUT LIFE INTO MY LEGS ONCE
MORE
THEY SET OFF BY THE ALLEYS THROUGH WHICH THE HEARSE HAD PASSED
ON
ARRIVING BEFORE THE CLOSED GATE AND THE PORTER'S PAVILION FAUCHELEVENT
WHO HELD THE GRAVE DIGGER'S CARD IN HIS HAND DROPPED IT INTO THE BOX
THE PORTER PULLED THE ROPE THE GATE OPENED AND THEY WENT OUT
HOW WELL EVERYTHING IS GOING SAID FAUCHELEVENT WHAT A CAPITAL IDEA
THAT WAS OF YOURS FATHER MADELEINE
THEY PASSED THE VAUGIRARD BARRIER IN THE SIMPLEST MANNER IN THE WORLD
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CEMETERY A SHOVEL AND PICK ARE EQUAL TO TWO
PASSPORTS
THE RUE VAUGIRARD WAS DESERTED
FATHER MADELEINE SAID FAUCHELEVENT AS THEY WENT ALONG AND RAISING
HIS EYES TO THE HOUSES YOUR EYES ARE BETTER THAN MINE
SHOW ME NO
87
HERE IT IS SAID JEAN VALJEAN
THERE IS NO ONE IN THE STREET SAID FAUCHELEVENT
GIVE ME YOUR
MATTOCK AND WAIT A COUPLE OF MINUTES FOR ME
FAUCHELEVENT ENTERED NO
87 ASCENDED TO THE VERY TOP GUIDED BY THE
INSTINCT WHICH ALWAYS LEADS THE POOR MAN TO THE GARRET AND KNOCKED IN
THE DARK AT THE DOOR OF AN ATTIC
A VOICE REPLIED COME IN
IT WAS GRIBIER'S VOICE
FAUCHELEVENT OPENED THE DOOR
THE GRAVE DIGGER'S DWELLING WAS LIKE
ALL SUCH WRETCHED HABITATIONS AN UNFURNISHED AND ENCUMBERED GARRET
A PACKING CASE A COFFIN PERHAPS TOOK THE PLACE OF A COMMODE A
BUTTER POT SERVED FOR A DRINKING FOUNTAIN A STRAW MATTRESS SERVED FOR
A BED THE FLOOR SERVED INSTEAD OF TABLES AND CHAIRS
IN A CORNER ON A
TATTERED FRAGMENT WHICH HAD BEEN A PIECE OF AN OLD CARPET A THIN
WOMAN AND A NUMBER OF CHILDREN WERE PILED IN A HEAP
THE WHOLE OF THIS
POVERTY STRICKEN INTERIOR BORE TRACES OF HAVING BEEN OVERTURNED
ONE
WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN EARTHQUAKE FOR ONE THE COVERS
WERE DISPLACED THE RAGS SCATTERED ABOUT THE JUG BROKEN THE MOTHER HAD
BEEN CRYING THE CHILDREN HAD PROBABLY BEEN BEATEN TRACES OF A VIGOROUS
AND ILL TEMPERED SEARCH
IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE GRAVE DIGGER HAD MADE
A DESPERATE SEARCH FOR HIS CARD AND HAD MADE EVERYBODY IN THE GARRET
FROM THE JUG TO HIS WIFE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS LOSS
HE WORE AN AIR OF
DESPERATION
BUT FAUCHELEVENT WAS IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO TERMINATE THIS ADVENTURE TO
TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THIS SAD SIDE OF HIS SUCCESS
HE ENTERED AND SAID
I HAVE BROUGHT YOU BACK YOUR SHOVEL AND PICK
GRIBIER GAZED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION
IS IT YOU PEASANT
AND TO MORROW MORNING YOU WILL FIND YOUR CARD WITH THE PORTER OF THE
CEMETERY
AND HE LAID THE SHOVEL AND MATTOCK ON THE FLOOR
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS DEMANDED GRIBIER
THE MEANING OF IT IS THAT YOU DROPPED YOUR CARD OUT OF YOUR POCKET
THAT I FOUND IT ON THE GROUND AFTER YOU WERE GONE THAT I HAVE BURIED
THE CORPSE THAT I HAVE FILLED THE GRAVE THAT I HAVE DONE YOUR WORK
THAT THE PORTER WILL RETURN YOUR CARD TO YOU AND THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE
TO PAY FIFTEEN FRANCS
THERE YOU HAVE IT CONSCRIPT
THANKS VILLAGER EXCLAIMED GRIBIER RADIANT
THE NEXT TIME I WILL
PAY FOR THE DRINKS
CHAPTER VIII A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORY
AN HOUR LATER IN THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT TWO MEN AND A CHILD PRESENTED
THEMSELVES AT NO
62 RUE PETIT PICPUS
THE ELDER OF THE MEN LIFTED THE
KNOCKER AND RAPPED
THEY WERE FAUCHELEVENT JEAN VALJEAN AND COSETTE
THE TWO OLD MEN HAD GONE TO FETCH COSETTE FROM THE FRUITERER'S IN
THE RUE DU CHEMIN VERT WHERE FAUCHELEVENT HAD DEPOSITED HER ON THE
PRECEDING DAY
COSETTE HAD PASSED THESE TWENTY FOUR HOURS TREMBLING
SILENTLY AND UNDERSTANDING NOTHING
SHE TREMBLED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT
SHE WEPT
SHE HAD NEITHER EATEN NOR SLEPT
THE WORTHY FRUIT SELLER HAD
PLIED HER WITH A HUNDRED QUESTIONS WITHOUT OBTAINING ANY OTHER REPLY
THAN A MELANCHOLY AND UNVARYING GAZE
COSETTE HAD BETRAYED NOTHING OF
WHAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD DURING THE LAST TWO DAYS
SHE DIVINED THAT
THEY WERE PASSING THROUGH A CRISIS
SHE WAS DEEPLY CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS
NECESSARY TO BE GOOD WHO HAS NOT EXPERIENCED THE SOVEREIGN POWER
OF THOSE TWO WORDS PRONOUNCED WITH A CERTAIN ACCENT IN THE EAR OF A
TERRIFIED LITTLE BEING SAY NOTHING FEAR IS MUTE
MOREOVER NO ONE
GUARDS A SECRET LIKE A CHILD
BUT WHEN AT THE EXPIRATION OF THESE LUGUBRIOUS TWENTY FOUR HOURS SHE
BEHELD JEAN VALJEAN AGAIN SHE GAVE VENT TO SUCH A CRY OF JOY THAT ANY
THOUGHTFUL PERSON WHO HAD CHANCED TO HEAR THAT CRY WOULD HAVE GUESSED
THAT IT ISSUED FROM AN ABYSS
FAUCHELEVENT BELONGED TO THE CONVENT AND KNEW THE PASS WORDS
ALL THE
DOORS OPENED
THUS WAS SOLVED THE DOUBLE AND ALARMING PROBLEM OF HOW TO GET OUT AND
HOW TO GET IN
THE PORTER WHO HAD RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS OPENED THE LITTLE
SERVANT'S DOOR WHICH CONNECTED THE COURTYARD WITH THE GARDEN AND WHICH
COULD STILL BE SEEN FROM THE STREET TWENTY YEARS AGO IN THE WALL AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE COURT WHICH FACED THE CARRIAGE ENTRANCE
THE PORTER ADMITTED ALL THREE OF THEM THROUGH THIS DOOR AND FROM THAT
POINT THEY REACHED THE INNER RESERVED PARLOR WHERE FAUCHELEVENT ON THE
PRECEDING DAY HAD RECEIVED HIS ORDERS FROM THE PRIORESS
THE PRIORESS ROSARY IN HAND WAS WAITING FOR THEM
A VOCAL MOTHER WITH
HER VEIL LOWERED STOOD BESIDE HER
A DISCREET CANDLE LIGHTED ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY MADE A SHOW OF LIGHTING
THE PARLOR
THE PRIORESS PASSED JEAN VALJEAN IN REVIEW
THERE IS NOTHING WHICH
EXAMINES LIKE A DOWNCAST EYE
THEN SHE QUESTIONED HIM
YOU ARE THE BROTHER
YES REVEREND MOTHER REPLIED FAUCHELEVENT
WHAT IS YOUR NAME
FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
ULTIME FAUCHELEVENT
HE REALLY HAD HAD A BROTHER NAMED ULTIME WHO WAS DEAD
WHERE DO YOU COME FROM
FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
FROM PICQUIGNY NEAR AMIENS
WHAT IS YOUR AGE
FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
FIFTY
WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION
FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
GARDENER
ARE YOU A GOOD CHRISTIAN
FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
EVERY ONE IS IN THE FAMILY
IS THIS YOUR LITTLE GIRL
FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
YES REVEREND MOTHER
YOU ARE HER FATHER
FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
HER GRANDFATHER
THE VOCAL MOTHER SAID TO THE PRIORESS IN A LOW VOICE
HE ANSWERS WELL
JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT UTTERED A SINGLE WORD
THE PRIORESS LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AT COSETTE AND SAID HALF ALOUD TO THE
VOCAL MOTHER
SHE WILL GROW UP UGLY
THE TWO MOTHERS CONSULTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN VERY LOW TONES IN THE
CORNER OF THE PARLOR THEN THE PRIORESS TURNED ROUND AND SAID
FATHER FAUVENT YOU WILL GET ANOTHER KNEE CAP WITH A BELL
TWO WILL BE
REQUIRED NOW
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THEREFORE TWO BELLS WERE AUDIBLE IN THE GARDEN
AND THE NUNS COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO RAISE THE CORNER OF
THEIR VEILS
AT THE EXTREME END OF THE GARDEN UNDER THE TREES TWO
MEN FAUVENT AND ANOTHER MAN WERE VISIBLE AS THEY DUG SIDE BY SIDE
AN
ENORMOUS EVENT
THEIR SILENCE WAS BROKEN TO THE EXTENT OF SAYING TO EACH
OTHER HE IS AN ASSISTANT GARDENER
THE VOCAL MOTHERS ADDED HE IS A BROTHER OF FATHER FAUVENT
JEAN VALJEAN WAS IN FACT REGULARLY INSTALLED HE HAD HIS BELLED
KNEE CAP HENCEFORTH HE WAS OFFICIAL
HIS NAME WAS ULTIME FAUCHELEVENT
THE MOST POWERFUL DETERMINING CAUSE OF HIS ADMISSION HAD BEEN THE
PRIORESS'S OBSERVATION UPON COSETTE SHE WILL GROW UP UGLY
THE PRIORESS THAT PRONOUNCED PROGNOSTICATOR IMMEDIATELY TOOK A FANCY
TO COSETTE AND GAVE HER A PLACE IN THE SCHOOL AS A CHARITY PUPIL
THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT STRICTLY LOGICAL ABOUT THIS
IT IS IN VAIN THAT MIRRORS ARE BANISHED FROM THE CONVENT WOMEN ARE
CONSCIOUS OF THEIR FACES NOW GIRLS WHO ARE CONSCIOUS OF THEIR BEAUTY
DO NOT EASILY BECOME NUNS THE VOCATION BEING VOLUNTARY IN INVERSE
PROPORTION TO THEIR GOOD LOOKS MORE IS TO BE HOPED FROM THE UGLY THAN
FROM THE PRETTY
HENCE A LIVELY TASTE FOR PLAIN GIRLS
THE WHOLE OF THIS ADVENTURE INCREASED THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD OLD
FAUCHELEVENT HE WON A TRIPLE SUCCESS IN THE EYES OF JEAN VALJEAN WHOM
HE HAD SAVED AND SHELTERED IN THOSE OF GRAVE DIGGER GRIBIER WHO SAID
TO HIMSELF HE SPARED ME THAT FINE WITH THE CONVENT WHICH BEING
ENABLED THANKS TO HIM TO RETAIN THE COFFIN OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
UNDER THE ALTAR ELUDED CAESAR AND SATISFIED GOD
THERE WAS A COFFIN
CONTAINING A BODY IN THE PETIT PICPUS AND A COFFIN WITHOUT A BODY IN
THE VAUGIRARD CEMETERY PUBLIC ORDER HAD NO DOUBT BEEN DEEPLY DISTURBED
THEREBY BUT NO ONE WAS AWARE OF IT
AS FOR THE CONVENT ITS GRATITUDE TO FAUCHELEVENT WAS VERY GREAT
FAUCHELEVENT BECAME THE BEST OF SERVITORS AND THE MOST PRECIOUS OF
GARDENERS
UPON THE OCCASION OF THE ARCHBISHOP'S NEXT VISIT THE
PRIORESS RECOUNTED THE AFFAIR TO HIS GRACE MAKING SOMETHING OF A
CONFESSION AT THE SAME TIME AND YET BOASTING OF HER DEED
ON LEAVING
THE CONVENT THE ARCHBISHOP MENTIONED IT WITH APPROVAL AND IN A WHISPER
TO M
DE LATIL MONSIEUR'S CONFESSOR AFTERWARDS ARCHBISHOP OF REIMS
AND CARDINAL
THIS ADMIRATION FOR FAUCHELEVENT BECAME WIDESPREAD FOR IT
MADE ITS WAY TO ROME
WE HAVE SEEN A NOTE ADDRESSED BY THE THEN REIGNING
POPE LEO XII TO ONE OF HIS RELATIVES A MONSIGNOR IN THE NUNCIO'S
ESTABLISHMENT IN PARIS AND BEARING LIKE HIMSELF THE NAME OF DELLA
GENGA IT CONTAINED THESE LINES IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS IN A CONVENT
IN PARIS AN EXCELLENT GARDENER WHO IS ALSO A HOLY MAN NAMED FAUVENT
NOTHING OF THIS TRIUMPH REACHED FAUCHELEVENT IN HIS HUT HE WENT ON
GRAFTING WEEDING AND COVERING UP HIS MELON BEDS WITHOUT IN THE LEAST
SUSPECTING HIS EXCELLENCES AND HIS SANCTITY
NEITHER DID HE SUSPECT HIS
GLORY ANY MORE THAN A DURHAM OR SURREY BULL WHOSE PORTRAIT IS PUBLISHED
IN THE LONDON ILLUSTRATED NEWS WITH THIS INSCRIPTION BULL WHICH
CARRIED OFF THE PRIZE AT THE CATTLE SHOW
CHAPTER IX CLOISTERED
COSETTE CONTINUED TO HOLD HER TONGUE IN THE CONVENT
IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT COSETTE SHOULD THINK HERSELF JEAN VALJEAN'S
DAUGHTER
MOREOVER AS SHE KNEW NOTHING SHE COULD SAY NOTHING AND
THEN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE SAID ANYTHING IN ANY CASE
AS WE HAVE JUST
OBSERVED NOTHING TRAINS CHILDREN TO SILENCE LIKE UNHAPPINESS
COSETTE
HAD SUFFERED SO MUCH THAT SHE FEARED EVERYTHING EVEN TO SPEAK OR TO
BREATHE
A SINGLE WORD HAD SO OFTEN BROUGHT DOWN AN AVALANCHE UPON HER
SHE HAD HARDLY BEGUN TO REGAIN HER CONFIDENCE SINCE SHE HAD BEEN WITH
JEAN VALJEAN
SHE SPEEDILY BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONVENT
ONLY SHE
REGRETTED CATHERINE BUT SHE DARED NOT SAY SO
ONCE HOWEVER SHE DID
SAY TO JEAN VALJEAN FATHER IF I HAD KNOWN I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HER
AWAY WITH ME
COSETTE HAD BEEN OBLIGED ON BECOMING A SCHOLAR IN THE CONVENT TO DON
THE GARB OF THE PUPILS OF THE HOUSE
JEAN VALJEAN SUCCEEDED IN GETTING
THEM TO RESTORE TO HIM THE GARMENTS WHICH SHE LAID ASIDE
THIS WAS THE
SAME MOURNING SUIT WHICH HE HAD MADE HER PUT ON WHEN SHE HAD QUITTED
THE THENARDIERS' INN
IT WAS NOT VERY THREADBARE EVEN NOW
JEAN VALJEAN
LOCKED UP THESE GARMENTS PLUS THE STOCKINGS AND THE SHOES WITH A
QUANTITY OF CAMPHOR AND ALL THE AROMATICS IN WHICH CONVENTS ABOUND IN A
LITTLE VALISE WHICH HE FOUND MEANS OF PROCURING
HE SET THIS VALISE ON
A CHAIR NEAR HIS BED AND HE ALWAYS CARRIED THE KEY ABOUT HIS PERSON
FATHER COSETTE ASKED HIM ONE DAY WHAT IS THERE IN THAT BOX WHICH
SMELLS SO GOOD
FATHER FAUCHELEVENT RECEIVED OTHER RECOMPENSE FOR HIS GOOD ACTION IN
ADDITION TO THE GLORY WHICH WE JUST MENTIONED AND OF WHICH HE KNEW
NOTHING IN THE FIRST PLACE IT MADE HIM HAPPY NEXT HE HAD MUCH LESS
WORK SINCE IT WAS SHARED
LASTLY AS HE WAS VERY FOND OF SNUFF HE
FOUND THE PRESENCE OF M
MADELEINE AN ADVANTAGE IN THAT HE USED THREE
TIMES AS MUCH AS HE HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY AND THAT IN AN INFINITELY MORE
LUXURIOUS MANNER SEEING THAT M
MADELEINE PAID FOR IT
THE NUNS DID NOT ADOPT THE NAME OF ULTIME THEY CALLED JEAN VALJEAN THE
OTHER FAUVENT
IF THESE HOLY WOMEN HAD POSSESSED ANYTHING OF JAVERT'S GLANCE THEY
WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE NOTICED THAT WHEN THERE WAS ANY ERRAND TO BE
DONE OUTSIDE IN THE BEHALF OF THE GARDEN IT WAS ALWAYS THE ELDER
FAUCHELEVENT THE OLD THE INFIRM THE LAME MAN WHO WENT AND NEVER THE
OTHER BUT WHETHER IT IS THAT EYES CONSTANTLY FIXED ON GOD KNOW NOT HOW
TO SPY OR WHETHER THEY WERE BY PREFERENCE OCCUPIED IN KEEPING WATCH
ON EACH OTHER THEY PAID NO HEED TO THIS
MOREOVER IT WAS WELL FOR JEAN VALJEAN THAT HE KEPT CLOSE AND DID NOT
STIR OUT
JAVERT WATCHED THE QUARTER FOR MORE THAN A MONTH
THIS CONVENT WAS FOR JEAN VALJEAN LIKE AN ISLAND SURROUNDED BY GULFS
HENCEFORTH THOSE FOUR WALLS CONSTITUTED HIS WORLD
HE SAW ENOUGH OF THE
SKY THERE TO ENABLE HIM TO PRESERVE HIS SERENITY AND COSETTE ENOUGH TO
REMAIN HAPPY
A VERY SWEET LIFE BEGAN FOR HIM
HE INHABITED THE OLD HUT AT THE END OF THE GARDEN IN COMPANY WITH
FAUCHELEVENT
THIS HOVEL BUILT OF OLD RUBBISH WHICH WAS STILL IN
EXISTENCE IN 1845 WAS COMPOSED AS THE READER ALREADY KNOWS OF THREE
CHAMBERS ALL OF WHICH WERE UTTERLY BARE AND HAD NOTHING BEYOND THE
WALLS
THE PRINCIPAL ONE HAD BEEN GIVEN UP BY FORCE FOR JEAN VALJEAN
HAD OPPOSED IT IN VAIN TO M
MADELEINE BY FATHER FAUCHELEVENT
THE
WALLS OF THIS CHAMBER HAD FOR ORNAMENT IN ADDITION TO THE TWO NAILS
WHEREON TO HANG THE KNEE CAP AND THE BASKET A ROYALIST BANK NOTE
OF '93 APPLIED TO THE WALL OVER THE CHIMNEY PIECE AND OF WHICH THE
FOLLOWING IS AN EXACT FACSIMILE
ILLUSTRATION ROYALIST BANK NOTE 2B8 9 BANKNOTE
THIS SPECIMEN OF VENDEAN PAPER MONEY HAD BEEN NAILED TO THE WALL BY
THE PRECEDING GARDENER AN OLD CHOUAN WHO HAD DIED IN THE CONVENT AND
WHOSE PLACE FAUCHELEVENT HAD TAKEN
JEAN VALJEAN WORKED IN THE GARDEN EVERY DAY AND MADE HIMSELF VERY
USEFUL
HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A PRUNER OF TREES AND HE GLADLY FOUND
HIMSELF A GARDENER ONCE MORE
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE KNEW ALL
SORTS OF SECRETS AND RECEIPTS FOR AGRICULTURE
HE TURNED THESE TO
ADVANTAGE
ALMOST ALL THE TREES IN THE ORCHARD WERE UNGRAFTED AND WILD
HE BUDDED THEM AND MADE THEM PRODUCE EXCELLENT FRUIT
COSETTE HAD PERMISSION TO PASS AN HOUR WITH HIM EVERY DAY
AS THE
SISTERS WERE MELANCHOLY AND HE WAS KIND THE CHILD MADE COMPARISONS AND
ADORED HIM
AT THE APPOINTED HOUR SHE FLEW TO THE HUT
WHEN SHE ENTERED
THE LOWLY CABIN SHE FILLED IT WITH PARADISE
JEAN VALJEAN BLOSSOMED
OUT AND FELT HIS HAPPINESS INCREASE WITH THE HAPPINESS WHICH HE AFFORDED
COSETTE
THE JOY WHICH WE INSPIRE HAS THIS CHARMING PROPERTY THAT FAR
FROM GROWING MEAGRE LIKE ALL REFLECTIONS IT RETURNS TO US MORE RADIANT
THAN EVER
AT RECREATION HOURS JEAN VALJEAN WATCHED HER RUNNING AND
PLAYING IN THE DISTANCE AND HE DISTINGUISHED HER LAUGH FROM THAT OF THE
REST
FOR COSETTE LAUGHED NOW
COSETTE'S FACE HAD EVEN UNDERGONE A CHANGE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
THE
GLOOM HAD DISAPPEARED FROM IT
A SMILE IS THE SAME AS SUNSHINE IT
BANISHES WINTER FROM THE HUMAN COUNTENANCE
RECREATION OVER WHEN COSETTE WENT INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN JEAN VALJEAN
GAZED AT THE WINDOWS OF HER CLASS ROOM AND AT NIGHT HE ROSE TO LOOK AT
THE WINDOWS OF HER DORMITORY
GOD HAS HIS OWN WAYS MOREOVER THE CONVENT CONTRIBUTED LIKE COSETTE
TO UPHOLD AND COMPLETE THE BISHOP'S WORK IN JEAN VALJEAN
IT IS CERTAIN
THAT VIRTUE ADJOINS PRIDE ON ONE SIDE
A BRIDGE BUILT BY THE DEVIL
EXISTS THERE
JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN UNCONSCIOUSLY PERHAPS TOLERABLY
NEAR THAT SIDE AND THAT BRIDGE WHEN PROVIDENCE CAST HIS LOT IN THE
CONVENT OF THE PETIT PICPUS SO LONG AS HE HAD COMPARED HIMSELF ONLY TO
THE BISHOP HE HAD REGARDED HIMSELF AS UNWORTHY AND HAD REMAINED HUMBLE
BUT FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN COMPARING HIMSELF TO MEN IN GENERAL
AND PRIDE WAS BEGINNING TO SPRING UP
WHO KNOWS HE MIGHT HAVE ENDED BY
RETURNING VERY GRADUALLY TO HATRED
THE CONVENT STOPPED HIM ON THAT DOWNWARD PATH
THIS WAS THE SECOND PLACE OF CAPTIVITY WHICH HE HAD SEEN
IN HIS YOUTH
IN WHAT HAD BEEN FOR HIM THE BEGINNING OF HIS LIFE AND LATER ON QUITE
RECENTLY AGAIN HE HAD BEHELD ANOTHER A FRIGHTFUL PLACE A TERRIBLE
PLACE WHOSE SEVERITIES HAD ALWAYS APPEARED TO HIM THE INIQUITY OF
JUSTICE AND THE CRIME OF THE LAW
NOW AFTER THE GALLEYS HE SAW THE
CLOISTER AND WHEN HE MEDITATED HOW HE HAD FORMED A PART OF THE GALLEYS
AND THAT HE NOW SO TO SPEAK WAS A SPECTATOR OF THE CLOISTER HE
CONFRONTED THE TWO IN HIS OWN MIND WITH ANXIETY
SOMETIMES HE CROSSED HIS ARMS AND LEANED ON HIS HOE AND SLOWLY
DESCENDED THE ENDLESS SPIRALS OF REVERY
HE RECALLED HIS FORMER COMPANIONS HOW WRETCHED THEY WERE THEY ROSE AT
DAWN AND TOILED UNTIL NIGHT HARDLY WERE THEY PERMITTED TO SLEEP THEY
LAY ON CAMP BEDS WHERE NOTHING WAS TOLERATED BUT MATTRESSES TWO INCHES
THICK IN ROOMS WHICH WERE HEATED ONLY IN THE VERY HARSHEST MONTHS OF
THE YEAR THEY WERE CLOTHED IN FRIGHTFUL RED BLOUSES THEY WERE ALLOWED
AS A GREAT FAVOR LINEN TROUSERS IN THE HOTTEST WEATHER AND A WOOLLEN
CARTER'S BLOUSE ON THEIR BACKS WHEN IT WAS VERY COLD THEY DRANK NO
WINE AND ATE NO MEAT EXCEPT WHEN THEY WENT ON FATIGUE DUTY THEY
LIVED NAMELESS DESIGNATED ONLY BY NUMBERS AND CONVERTED AFTER A
MANNER INTO CIPHERS THEMSELVES WITH DOWNCAST EYES WITH LOWERED
VOICES WITH SHORN HEADS BENEATH THE CUDGEL AND IN DISGRACE
THEN HIS MIND REVERTED TO THE BEINGS WHOM HE HAD UNDER HIS EYES
THESE BEINGS ALSO LIVED WITH SHORN HEADS WITH DOWNCAST EYES WITH
LOWERED VOICES NOT IN DISGRACE BUT AMID THE SCOFFS OF THE WORLD
NOT WITH THEIR BACKS BRUISED WITH THE CUDGEL BUT WITH THEIR SHOULDERS
LACERATED WITH THEIR DISCIPLINE
THEIR NAMES ALSO HAD VANISHED FROM
AMONG MEN THEY NO LONGER EXISTED EXCEPT UNDER AUSTERE APPELLATIONS
THEY NEVER ATE MEAT AND THEY NEVER DRANK WINE THEY OFTEN REMAINED UNTIL
EVENING WITHOUT FOOD THEY WERE ATTIRED NOT IN A RED BLOUSE BUT IN A
BLACK SHROUD OF WOOLLEN WHICH WAS HEAVY IN SUMMER AND THIN IN WINTER
WITHOUT THE POWER TO ADD OR SUBTRACT ANYTHING FROM IT WITHOUT HAVING
EVEN ACCORDING TO THE SEASON THE RESOURCE OF THE LINEN GARMENT OR THE
WOOLLEN CLOAK AND FOR SIX MONTHS IN THE YEAR THEY WORE SERGE CHEMISES
WHICH GAVE THEM FEVER
THEY DWELT NOT IN ROOMS WARMED ONLY DURING
RIGOROUS COLD BUT IN CELLS WHERE NO FIRE WAS EVER LIGHTED THEY SLEPT
NOT ON MATTRESSES TWO INCHES THICK BUT ON STRAW
AND FINALLY THEY WERE
NOT EVEN ALLOWED THEIR SLEEP EVERY NIGHT AFTER A DAY OF TOIL THEY
WERE OBLIGED IN THE WEARINESS OF THEIR FIRST SLUMBER AT THE MOMENT
WHEN THEY WERE FALLING SOUND ASLEEP AND BEGINNING TO GET WARM TO ROUSE
THEMSELVES TO RISE AND TO GO AND PRAY IN AN ICE COLD AND GLOOMY CHAPEL
WITH THEIR KNEES ON THE STONES
ON CERTAIN DAYS EACH OF THESE BEINGS IN TURN HAD TO REMAIN FOR TWELVE
SUCCESSIVE HOURS IN A KNEELING POSTURE OR PROSTRATE WITH FACE UPON THE
PAVEMENT AND ARMS OUTSTRETCHED IN THE FORM OF A CROSS
THE OTHERS WERE MEN THESE WERE WOMEN
WHAT HAD THOSE MEN DONE THEY HAD STOLEN VIOLATED PILLAGED
MURDERED ASSASSINATED
THEY WERE BANDITS COUNTERFEITERS POISONERS
INCENDIARIES MURDERERS PARRICIDES
WHAT HAD THESE WOMEN DONE THEY HAD
DONE NOTHING WHATEVER
ON THE ONE HAND HIGHWAY ROBBERY FRAUD DECEIT VIOLENCE SENSUALITY
HOMICIDE ALL SORTS OF SACRILEGE EVERY VARIETY OF CRIME ON THE OTHER
ONE THING ONLY INNOCENCE
PERFECT INNOCENCE ALMOST CAUGHT UP INTO HEAVEN IN A MYSTERIOUS
ASSUMPTION ATTACHED TO THE EARTH BY VIRTUE ALREADY POSSESSING
SOMETHING OF HEAVEN THROUGH HOLINESS
ON THE ONE HAND CONFIDENCES OVER CRIMES WHICH ARE EXCHANGED IN
WHISPERS ON THE OTHER THE CONFESSION OF FAULTS MADE ALOUD
AND WHAT
CRIMES AND WHAT FAULTS
ON THE ONE HAND MIASMS ON THE OTHER AN INEFFABLE PERFUME
ON THE ONE
HAND A MORAL PEST GUARDED FROM SIGHT PENNED UP UNDER THE RANGE OF
CANNON AND LITERALLY DEVOURING ITS PLAGUE STRICKEN VICTIMS ON
THE OTHER THE CHASTE FLAME OF ALL SOULS ON THE SAME HEARTH
THERE
DARKNESS HERE THE SHADOW BUT A SHADOW FILLED WITH GLEAMS OF LIGHT
AND OF GLEAMS FULL OF RADIANCE
TWO STRONGHOLDS OF SLAVERY BUT IN THE FIRST DELIVERANCE POSSIBLE
A LEGAL LIMIT ALWAYS IN SIGHT AND THEN ESCAPE
IN THE SECOND
PERPETUITY THE SOLE HOPE AT THE DISTANT EXTREMITY OF THE FUTURE THAT
FAINT LIGHT OF LIBERTY WHICH MEN CALL DEATH
IN THE FIRST MEN ARE BOUND ONLY WITH CHAINS IN THE OTHER CHAINED BY
FAITH
WHAT FLOWED FROM THE FIRST AN IMMENSE CURSE THE GNASHING OF TEETH
HATRED DESPERATE VICIOUSNESS A CRY OF RAGE AGAINST HUMAN SOCIETY A
SARCASM AGAINST HEAVEN
WHAT RESULTS FLOWED FROM THE SECOND BLESSINGS AND LOVE
AND IN THESE TWO PLACES SO SIMILAR YET SO UNLIKE THESE TWO SPECIES
OF BEINGS WHO WERE SO VERY UNLIKE WERE UNDERGOING THE SAME WORK
EXPIATION
JEAN VALJEAN UNDERSTOOD THOROUGHLY THE EXPIATION OF THE FORMER THAT
PERSONAL EXPIATION THE EXPIATION FOR ONE'S SELF
BUT HE DID NOT
UNDERSTAND THAT OF THESE LAST THAT OF CREATURES WITHOUT REPROACH AND
WITHOUT STAIN AND HE TREMBLED AS HE ASKED HIMSELF THE EXPIATION OF
WHAT WHAT EXPIATION
A VOICE WITHIN HIS CONSCIENCE REPLIED THE MOST DIVINE OF HUMAN
GENEROSITIES THE EXPIATION FOR OTHERS
HERE ALL PERSONAL THEORY IS WITHHELD WE ARE ONLY THE NARRATOR WE
PLACE OURSELVES AT JEAN VALJEAN'S POINT OF VIEW AND WE TRANSLATE HIS
IMPRESSIONS
BEFORE HIS EYES HE HAD THE SUBLIME SUMMIT OF ABNEGATION THE HIGHEST
POSSIBLE PITCH OF VIRTUE THE INNOCENCE WHICH PARDONS MEN THEIR FAULTS
AND WHICH EXPIATES IN THEIR STEAD SERVITUDE SUBMITTED TO TORTURE
ACCEPTED PUNISHMENT CLAIMED BY SOULS WHICH HAVE NOT SINNED FOR THE
SAKE OF SPARING IT TO SOULS WHICH HAVE FALLEN THE LOVE OF HUMANITY
SWALLOWED UP IN THE LOVE OF GOD BUT EVEN THERE PRESERVING ITS DISTINCT
AND MEDIATORIAL CHARACTER SWEET AND FEEBLE BEINGS POSSESSING THE MISERY
OF THOSE WHO ARE PUNISHED AND THE SMILE OF THOSE WHO ARE RECOMPENSED
AND HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD DARED TO MURMUR
OFTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HE ROSE TO LISTEN TO THE GRATEFUL
SONG OF THOSE INNOCENT CREATURES WEIGHED DOWN WITH SEVERITIES AND THE
BLOOD RAN COLD IN HIS VEINS AT THE THOUGHT THAT THOSE WHO WERE JUSTLY
CHASTISED RAISED THEIR VOICES HEAVENWARD ONLY IN BLASPHEMY AND THAT HE
WRETCH THAT HE WAS HAD SHAKEN HIS FIST AT GOD
THERE WAS ONE STRIKING THING WHICH CAUSED HIM TO MEDITATE DEEPLY LIKE
A WARNING WHISPER FROM PROVIDENCE ITSELF THE SCALING OF THAT WALL THE
PASSING OF THOSE BARRIERS THE ADVENTURE ACCEPTED EVEN AT THE RISK OF
DEATH THE PAINFUL AND DIFFICULT ASCENT ALL THOSE EFFORTS EVEN WHICH
HE HAD MADE TO ESCAPE FROM THAT OTHER PLACE OF EXPIATION HE HAD MADE IN
ORDER TO GAIN ENTRANCE INTO THIS ONE
WAS THIS A SYMBOL OF HIS DESTINY
THIS HOUSE WAS A PRISON LIKEWISE AND BORE A MELANCHOLY RESEMBLANCE TO
THAT OTHER ONE WHENCE HE HAD FLED AND YET HE HAD NEVER CONCEIVED AN
IDEA OF ANYTHING SIMILAR
AGAIN HE BEHELD GRATINGS BOLTS IRON BARS TO GUARD WHOM ANGELS
THESE LOFTY WALLS WHICH HE HAD SEEN AROUND TIGERS HE NOW BEHELD ONCE
MORE AROUND LAMBS
THIS WAS A PLACE OF EXPIATION AND NOT OF PUNISHMENT AND YET IT WAS
STILL MORE AUSTERE MORE GLOOMY AND MORE PITILESS THAN THE OTHER
THESE VIRGINS WERE EVEN MORE HEAVILY BURDENED THAN THE CONVICTS
A COLD
HARSH WIND THAT WIND WHICH HAD CHILLED HIS YOUTH TRAVERSED THE BARRED
AND PADLOCKED GRATING OF THE VULTURES A STILL HARSHER AND MORE BITING
BREEZE BLEW IN THE CAGE OF THESE DOVES
WHY
WHEN HE THOUGHT ON THESE THINGS ALL THAT WAS WITHIN HIM WAS LOST IN
AMAZEMENT BEFORE THIS MYSTERY OF SUBLIMITY
IN THESE MEDITATIONS HIS PRIDE VANISHED
HE SCRUTINIZED HIS OWN HEART
IN ALL MANNER OF WAYS HE FELT HIS PETTINESS AND MANY A TIME HE WEPT
ALL THAT HAD ENTERED INTO HIS LIFE FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS HAD LED HIM
BACK TOWARDS THE BISHOP'S HOLY INJUNCTIONS COSETTE THROUGH LOVE THE
CONVENT THROUGH HUMILITY
SOMETIMES AT EVENTIDE IN THE TWILIGHT AT AN HOUR WHEN THE GARDEN WAS
DESERTED HE COULD BE SEEN ON HIS KNEES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALK WHICH
SKIRTED THE CHAPEL IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH HE HAD GAZED ON
THE NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL AND TURNED TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE AS HE KNEW
THE SISTER WAS MAKING REPARATION PROSTRATED IN PRAYER
THUS HE PRAYED
AS HE KNELT BEFORE THE SISTER
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE DARED NOT KNEEL DIRECTLY BEFORE GOD
EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDED HIM THAT PEACEFUL GARDEN THOSE FRAGRANT
FLOWERS THOSE CHILDREN WHO UTTERED JOYOUS CRIES THOSE GRAVE AND SIMPLE
WOMEN THAT SILENT CLOISTER SLOWLY PERMEATED HIM AND LITTLE BY LITTLE
HIS SOUL BECAME COMPOUNDED OF SILENCE LIKE THE CLOISTER OF PERFUME LIKE
THE FLOWERS OF SIMPLICITY LIKE THE WOMEN OF JOY LIKE THE CHILDREN
AND THEN HE REFLECTED THAT THESE HAD BEEN TWO HOUSES OF GOD WHICH HAD
RECEIVED HIM IN SUCCESSION AT TWO CRITICAL MOMENTS IN HIS LIFE THE
FIRST WHEN ALL DOORS WERE CLOSED AND WHEN HUMAN SOCIETY REJECTED HIM
THE SECOND AT A MOMENT WHEN HUMAN SOCIETY HAD AGAIN SET OUT IN PURSUIT
OF HIM AND WHEN THE GALLEYS WERE AGAIN YAWNING AND THAT HAD IT NOT
BEEN FOR THE FIRST HE SHOULD HAVE RELAPSED INTO CRIME AND HAD IT NOT
BEEN FOR THE SECOND INTO TORMENT
HIS WHOLE HEART MELTED IN GRATITUDE AND HE LOVED MORE AND MORE
MANY YEARS PASSED IN THIS MANNER COSETTE WAS GROWING UP

CHAPTER I PARVULUS
PARIS HAS A CHILD AND THE FOREST HAS A BIRD THE BIRD IS CALLED THE
SPARROW THE CHILD IS CALLED THE GAMIN
COUPLE THESE TWO IDEAS WHICH CONTAIN THE ONE ALL THE FURNACE THE OTHER
ALL THE DAWN STRIKE THESE TWO SPARKS TOGETHER PARIS CHILDHOOD THERE
LEAPS OUT FROM THEM A LITTLE BEING
HOMUNCIO PLAUTUS WOULD SAY
THIS LITTLE BEING IS JOYOUS
HE HAS NOT FOOD EVERY DAY AND HE GOES TO
THE PLAY EVERY EVENING IF HE SEES GOOD
HE HAS NO SHIRT ON HIS BODY
NO SHOES ON HIS FEET NO ROOF OVER HIS HEAD HE IS LIKE THE FLIES OF
HEAVEN WHO HAVE NONE OF THESE THINGS
HE IS FROM SEVEN TO THIRTEEN
YEARS OF AGE HE LIVES IN BANDS ROAMS THE STREETS LODGES IN THE OPEN
AIR WEARS AN OLD PAIR OF TROUSERS OF HIS FATHER'S WHICH DESCEND BELOW
HIS HEELS AN OLD HAT OF SOME OTHER FATHER WHICH DESCENDS BELOW HIS
EARS A SINGLE SUSPENDER OF YELLOW LISTING HE RUNS LIES IN WAIT
RUMMAGES ABOUT WASTES TIME BLACKENS PIPES SWEARS LIKE A CONVICT
HAUNTS THE WINE SHOP KNOWS THIEVES CALLS GAY WOMEN THOU TALKS SLANG
SINGS OBSCENE SONGS AND HAS NO EVIL IN HIS HEART
THIS IS BECAUSE HE
HAS IN HIS HEART A PEARL INNOCENCE AND PEARLS ARE NOT TO BE DISSOLVED
IN MUD
SO LONG AS MAN IS IN HIS CHILDHOOD GOD WILLS THAT HE SHALL BE
INNOCENT
IF ONE WERE TO ASK THAT ENORMOUS CITY WHAT IS THIS SHE WOULD REPLY
IT IS MY LITTLE ONE
CHAPTER II SOME OF HIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS
THE GAMIN THE STREET ARAB OF PARIS IS THE DWARF OF THE GIANT
LET US NOT EXAGGERATE THIS CHERUB OF THE GUTTER SOMETIMES HAS A SHIRT
BUT IN THAT CASE HE OWNS BUT ONE HE SOMETIMES HAS SHOES BUT THEN
THEY HAVE NO SOLES HE SOMETIMES HAS A LODGING AND HE LOVES IT FOR
HE FINDS HIS MOTHER THERE BUT HE PREFERS THE STREET BECAUSE THERE HE
FINDS LIBERTY
HE HAS HIS OWN GAMES HIS OWN BITS OF MISCHIEF WHOSE
FOUNDATION CONSISTS OF HATRED FOR THE BOURGEOIS HIS PECULIAR METAPHORS
TO BE DEAD IS TO EAT DANDELIONS BY THE ROOT HIS OWN OCCUPATIONS
CALLING HACKNEY COACHES LETTING DOWN CARRIAGE STEPS ESTABLISHING MEANS
OF TRANSIT BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF A STREET IN HEAVY RAINS WHICH HE
CALLS MAKING THE BRIDGE OF ARTS CRYING DISCOURSES PRONOUNCED BY THE
AUTHORITIES IN FAVOR OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE CLEANING OUT THE CRACKS
IN THE PAVEMENT HE HAS HIS OWN COINAGE WHICH IS COMPOSED OF ALL THE
LITTLE MORSELS OF WORKED COPPER WHICH ARE FOUND ON THE PUBLIC STREETS
THIS CURIOUS MONEY WHICH RECEIVES THE NAME OF LOQUES RAGS HAS
AN INVARIABLE AND WELL REGULATED CURRENCY IN THIS LITTLE BOHEMIA OF
CHILDREN
LASTLY HE HAS HIS OWN FAUNA WHICH HE OBSERVES ATTENTIVELY IN
THE CORNERS THE LADY BIRD THE DEATH'S HEAD PLANT LOUSE THE
DADDY LONG LEGS THE DEVIL A BLACK INSECT WHICH MENACES BY TWISTING
ABOUT ITS TAIL ARMED WITH TWO HORNS
HE HAS HIS FABULOUS MONSTER WHICH
HAS SCALES UNDER ITS BELLY BUT IS NOT A LIZARD WHICH HAS PUSTULES ON
ITS BACK BUT IS NOT A TOAD WHICH INHABITS THE NOOKS OF OLD LIME KILNS
AND WELLS THAT HAVE RUN DRY WHICH IS BLACK HAIRY STICKY WHICH CRAWLS
SOMETIMES SLOWLY SOMETIMES RAPIDLY WHICH HAS NO CRY BUT WHICH HAS A
LOOK AND IS SO TERRIBLE THAT NO ONE HAS EVER BEHELD IT HE CALLS THIS
MONSTER THE DEAF THING THE SEARCH FOR THESE DEAF THINGS AMONG
THE STONES IS A JOY OF FORMIDABLE NATURE
ANOTHER PLEASURE CONSISTS IN
SUDDENLY PRYING UP A PAVING STONE AND TAKING A LOOK AT THE WOOD LICE
EACH REGION OF PARIS IS CELEBRATED FOR THE INTERESTING TREASURES WHICH
ARE TO BE FOUND THERE
THERE ARE EAR WIGS IN THE TIMBER YARDS OF THE
URSULINES THERE ARE MILLEPEDS IN THE PANTHEON THERE ARE TADPOLES IN
THE DITCHES OF THE CHAMPS DE MARS
AS FAR AS SAYINGS ARE CONCERNED THIS CHILD HAS AS MANY OF THEM AS
TALLEYRAND
HE IS NO LESS CYNICAL BUT HE IS MORE HONEST
HE IS ENDOWED
WITH A CERTAIN INDESCRIBABLE UNEXPECTED JOVIALITY HE UPSETS THE
COMPOSURE OF THE SHOPKEEPER WITH HIS WILD LAUGHTER
HE RANGES BOLDLY
FROM HIGH COMEDY TO FARCE
A FUNERAL PASSES BY
AMONG THOSE WHO ACCOMPANY THE DEAD THERE IS A
DOCTOR
HEY THERE SHOUTS SOME STREET ARAB HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
CUSTOMARY FOR DOCTORS TO CARRY HOME THEIR OWN WORK
ANOTHER IS IN A CROWD
A GRAVE MAN ADORNED WITH SPECTACLES AND
TRINKETS TURNS ROUND INDIGNANTLY YOU GOOD FOR NOTHING YOU HAVE
SEIZED MY WIFE'S WAIST I SIR SEARCH ME
CHAPTER III HE IS AGREEABLE
IN THE EVENING THANKS TO A FEW SOUS WHICH HE ALWAYS FINDS MEANS
TO PROCURE THE HOMUNCIO ENTERS A THEATRE
ON CROSSING THAT MAGIC
THRESHOLD HE BECOMES TRANSFIGURED HE WAS THE STREET ARAB HE BECOMES
THE TITI 18 THEATRES ARE A SORT OF SHIP TURNED UPSIDE DOWN WITH THE
KEEL IN THE AIR
IT IS IN THAT KEEL THAT THE TITI HUDDLE TOGETHER
THE TITI IS TO THE GAMIN WHAT THE MOTH IS TO THE LARVA THE SAME BEING
ENDOWED WITH WINGS AND SOARING
IT SUFFICES FOR HIM TO BE THERE WITH
HIS RADIANCE OF HAPPINESS WITH HIS POWER OF ENTHUSIASM AND JOY WITH
HIS HAND CLAPPING WHICH RESEMBLES A CLAPPING OF WINGS TO CONFER ON
THAT NARROW DARK FETID SORDID UNHEALTHY HIDEOUS ABOMINABLE KEEL
THE NAME OF PARADISE
BESTOW ON AN INDIVIDUAL THE USELESS AND DEPRIVE HIM OF THE NECESSARY
AND YOU HAVE THE GAMIN
THE GAMIN IS NOT DEVOID OF LITERARY INTUITION
HIS TENDENCY AND WE SAY
IT WITH THE PROPER AMOUNT OF REGRET WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE CLASSIC
TASTE
HE IS NOT VERY ACADEMIC BY NATURE
THUS TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE THE
POPULARITY OF MADEMOISELLE MARS AMONG THAT LITTLE AUDIENCE OF STORMY
CHILDREN WAS SEASONED WITH A TOUCH OF IRONY
THE GAMIN CALLED HER
MADEMOISELLE MUCHE HIDE YOURSELF
THIS BEING BAWLS AND SCOFFS AND RIDICULES AND FIGHTS HAS RAGS LIKE A
BABY AND TATTERS LIKE A PHILOSOPHER FISHES IN THE SEWER HUNTS IN THE
CESSPOOL EXTRACTS MIRTH FROM FOULNESS WHIPS UP THE SQUARES WITH HIS
WIT GRINS AND BITES WHISTLES AND SINGS SHOUTS AND SHRIEKS TEMPERS
ALLELUIA WITH MATANTUR LURETTE CHANTS EVERY RHYTHM FROM THE DE
PROFUNDIS TO THE JACK PUDDING FINDS WITHOUT SEEKING KNOWS WHAT HE IS
IGNORANT OF IS A SPARTAN TO THE POINT OF THIEVING IS MAD TO WISDOM IS
LYRICAL TO FILTH WOULD CROUCH DOWN ON OLYMPUS WALLOWS IN THE DUNGHILL
AND EMERGES FROM IT COVERED WITH STARS
THE GAMIN OF PARIS IS RABELAIS
IN THIS YOUTH
HE IS NOT CONTENT WITH HIS TROUSERS UNLESS THEY HAVE A WATCH POCKET
HE IS NOT EASILY ASTONISHED HE IS STILL LESS EASILY TERRIFIED HE MAKES
SONGS ON SUPERSTITIONS HE TAKES THE WIND OUT OF EXAGGERATIONS HE TWITS
MYSTERIES HE THRUSTS OUT HIS TONGUE AT GHOSTS HE TAKES THE POETRY OUT
OF STILTED THINGS HE INTRODUCES CARICATURE INTO EPIC EXTRAVAGANZAS
IT IS NOT THAT HE IS PROSAIC FAR FROM THAT BUT HE REPLACES THE SOLEMN
VISION BY THE FARCICAL PHANTASMAGORIA
IF ADAMASTOR WERE TO APPEAR TO
HIM THE STREET ARAB WOULD SAY HI THERE THE BUGABOO
CHAPTER IV HE MAY BE OF USE
PARIS BEGINS WITH THE LOUNGER AND ENDS WITH THE STREET ARAB TWO
BEINGS OF WHICH NO OTHER CITY IS CAPABLE THE PASSIVE ACCEPTANCE WHICH
CONTENTS ITSELF WITH GAZING AND THE INEXHAUSTIBLE INITIATIVE PRUDHOMME
AND FOUILLOU
PARIS ALONE HAS THIS IN ITS NATURAL HISTORY
THE WHOLE OF
THE MONARCHY IS CONTAINED IN THE LOUNGER THE WHOLE OF ANARCHY IN THE
GAMIN
THIS PALE CHILD OF THE PARISIAN FAUBOURGS LIVES AND DEVELOPS MAKES
CONNECTIONS GROWS SUPPLE IN SUFFERING IN THE PRESENCE OF SOCIAL
REALITIES AND OF HUMAN THINGS A THOUGHTFUL WITNESS
HE THINKS HIMSELF
HEEDLESS AND HE IS NOT
HE LOOKS AND IS ON THE VERGE OF LAUGHTER HE IS
ON THE VERGE OF SOMETHING ELSE ALSO
WHOEVER YOU MAY BE IF YOUR NAME IS
PREJUDICE ABUSE IGNORANCE OPPRESSION INIQUITY DESPOTISM INJUSTICE
FANATICISM TYRANNY BEWARE OF THE GAPING GAMIN
THE LITTLE FELLOW WILL GROW UP
OF WHAT CLAY IS HE MADE OF THE FIRST MUD THAT COMES TO HAND
A HANDFUL
OF DIRT A BREATH AND BEHOLD ADAM
IT SUFFICES FOR A GOD TO PASS BY
A
GOD HAS ALWAYS PASSED OVER THE STREET ARAB
FORTUNE LABORS AT THIS TINY
BEING
BY THE WORD FORTUNE WE MEAN CHANCE TO SOME EXTENT
THAT PIGMY
KNEADED OUT OF COMMON EARTH IGNORANT UNLETTERED GIDDY VULGAR LOW
WILL THAT BECOME AN IONIAN OR A BOEOTIAN WAIT CURRIT ROTA THE SPIRIT
OF PARIS THAT DEMON WHICH CREATES THE CHILDREN OF CHANCE AND THE MEN
OF DESTINY REVERSING THE PROCESS OF THE LATIN POTTER MAKES OF A JUG AN
AMPHORA
CHAPTER V HIS FRONTIERS
THE GAMIN LOVES THE CITY HE ALSO LOVES SOLITUDE SINCE HE HAS SOMETHING
OF THE SAGE IN HIM
URBIS AMATOR LIKE FUSCUS RURIS AMATOR LIKE
FLACCUS
TO ROAM THOUGHTFULLY ABOUT THAT IS TO SAY TO LOUNGE IS A FINE
EMPLOYMENT OF TIME IN THE EYES OF THE PHILOSOPHER PARTICULARLY IN THAT
RATHER ILLEGITIMATE SPECIES OF CAMPAIGN WHICH IS TOLERABLY UGLY BUT
ODD AND COMPOSED OF TWO NATURES WHICH SURROUNDS CERTAIN GREAT CITIES
NOTABLY PARIS
TO STUDY THE SUBURBS IS TO STUDY THE AMPHIBIOUS ANIMAL
END OF THE TREES BEGINNING OF THE ROOFS END OF THE GRASS BEGINNING
OF THE PAVEMENTS END OF THE FURROWS BEGINNING OF THE SHOPS END OF
THE WHEEL RUTS BEGINNING OF THE PASSIONS END OF THE DIVINE MURMUR
BEGINNING OF THE HUMAN UPROAR HENCE AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST
HENCE IN THESE NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE PLACES INDELIBLY STAMPED BY THE
PASSING STROLLER WITH THE EPITHET MELANCHOLY THE APPARENTLY OBJECTLESS
PROMENADES OF THE DREAMER
HE WHO WRITES THESE LINES HAS LONG BEEN A PROWLER ABOUT THE BARRIERS
OF PARIS AND IT IS FOR HIM A SOURCE OF PROFOUND SOUVENIRS
THAT
CLOSE SHAVEN TURF THOSE PEBBLY PATHS THAT CHALK THOSE POOLS
THOSE HARSH MONOTONIES OF WASTE AND FALLOW LANDS THE PLANTS OF EARLY
MARKET GARDEN SUDDENLY SPRINGING INTO SIGHT IN A BOTTOM THAT MIXTURE OF
THE SAVAGE AND THE CITIZEN THOSE VAST DESERT NOOKS WHERE THE GARRISON
DRUMS PRACTISE NOISILY AND PRODUCE A SORT OF LISPING OF BATTLE THOSE
HERMITS BY DAY AND CUT THROATS BY NIGHT THAT CLUMSY MILL WHICH TURNS
IN THE WIND THE HOISTING WHEELS OF THE QUARRIES THE TEA GARDENS AT THE
CORNERS OF THE CEMETERIES THE MYSTERIOUS CHARM OF GREAT SOMBRE WALLS
SQUARELY INTERSECTING IMMENSE VAGUE STRETCHES OF LAND INUNDATED WITH
SUNSHINE AND FULL OF BUTTERFLIES ALL THIS ATTRACTED HIM
THERE IS HARDLY ANY ONE ON EARTH WHO IS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THOSE
SINGULAR SPOTS THE GLACIERE THE CUNETTE THE HIDEOUS WALL OF GRENELLE
ALL SPECKLED WITH BALLS MONT PARNASSE THE FOSSE AUX LOUPS AUBIERS ON
THE BANK OF THE MARNE MONT SOURIS THE TOMBE ISSOIRE THE PIERRE PLATE
DE CHATILLON WHERE THERE IS AN OLD EXHAUSTED QUARRY WHICH NO LONGER
SERVES ANY PURPOSE EXCEPT TO RAISE MUSHROOMS AND WHICH IS CLOSED ON A
LEVEL WITH THE GROUND BY A TRAP DOOR OF ROTTEN PLANKS
THE CAMPAGNA OF
ROME IS ONE IDEA THE BANLIEUE OF PARIS IS ANOTHER TO BEHOLD NOTHING
BUT FIELDS HOUSES OR TREES IN WHAT A STRETCH OF COUNTRY OFFERS US IS
TO REMAIN ON THE SURFACE ALL ASPECTS OF THINGS ARE THOUGHTS OF GOD
THE
SPOT WHERE A PLAIN EFFECTS ITS JUNCTION WITH A CITY IS ALWAYS STAMPED
WITH A CERTAIN PIERCING MELANCHOLY
NATURE AND HUMANITY BOTH APPEAL
TO YOU AT THE SAME TIME THERE
LOCAL ORIGINALITIES THERE MAKE THEIR
APPEARANCE
ANY ONE WHO LIKE OURSELVES HAS WANDERED ABOUT IN THESE SOLITUDES
CONTIGUOUS TO OUR FAUBOURGS WHICH MAY BE DESIGNATED AS THE LIMBOS OF
PARIS HAS SEEN HERE AND THERE IN THE MOST DESERT SPOT AT THE
MOST UNEXPECTED MOMENT BEHIND A MEAGRE HEDGE OR IN THE CORNER OF A
LUGUBRIOUS WALL CHILDREN GROUPED TUMULTUOUSLY FETID MUDDY
DUSTY RAGGED DISHEVELLED PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK AND CROWNED WITH
CORN FLOWERS
ALL OF THEM ARE LITTLE ONES WHO HAVE MADE THEIR ESCAPE
FROM POOR FAMILIES
THE OUTER BOULEVARD IS THEIR BREATHING SPACE THE
SUBURBS BELONG TO THEM
THERE THEY ARE ETERNALLY PLAYING TRUANT
THERE
THEY INNOCENTLY SING THEIR REPERTORY OF DIRTY SONGS
THERE THEY ARE OR
RATHER THERE THEY EXIST FAR FROM EVERY EYE IN THE SWEET LIGHT OF
MAY OR JUNE KNEELING ROUND A HOLE IN THE GROUND SNAPPING MARBLES WITH
THEIR THUMBS QUARRELLING OVER HALF FARTHINGS IRRESPONSIBLE VOLATILE
FREE AND HAPPY AND NO SOONER DO THEY CATCH SIGHT OF YOU THAN THEY
RECOLLECT THAT THEY HAVE AN INDUSTRY AND THAT THEY MUST EARN THEIR
LIVING AND THEY OFFER TO SELL YOU AN OLD WOOLLEN STOCKING FILLED
WITH COCKCHAFERS OR A BUNCH OF LILACS
THESE ENCOUNTERS WITH STRANGE
CHILDREN ARE ONE OF THE CHARMING AND AT THE SAME TIME POIGNANT GRACES OF
THE ENVIRONS OF PARIS
SOMETIMES THERE ARE LITTLE GIRLS AMONG THE THRONG OF BOYS ARE THEY
THEIR SISTERS WHO ARE ALMOST YOUNG MAIDENS THIN FEVERISH WITH
SUNBURNT HANDS COVERED WITH FRECKLES CROWNED WITH POPPIES AND EARS OF
RYE GAY HAGGARD BAREFOOTED
THEY CAN BE SEEN DEVOURING CHERRIES AMONG
THE WHEAT
IN THE EVENING THEY CAN BE HEARD LAUGHING
THESE GROUPS
WARMLY ILLUMINATED BY THE FULL GLOW OF MIDDAY OR INDISTINCTLY SEEN IN
THE TWILIGHT OCCUPY THE THOUGHTFUL MAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THESE
VISIONS MINGLE WITH HIS DREAMS
PARIS CENTRE BANLIEUE CIRCUMFERENCE THIS CONSTITUTES ALL THE EARTH
TO THOSE CHILDREN
THEY NEVER VENTURE BEYOND THIS
THEY CAN NO MORE
ESCAPE FROM THE PARISIAN ATMOSPHERE THAN FISH CAN ESCAPE FROM THE
WATER
FOR THEM NOTHING EXISTS TWO LEAGUES BEYOND THE BARRIERS

CHAPTER VI A BIT OF HISTORY
AT THE EPOCH NEARLY CONTEMPORARY BY THE WAY WHEN THE ACTION OF THIS
BOOK TAKES PLACE THERE WAS NOT AS THERE IS TO DAY A POLICEMAN AT
THE CORNER OF EVERY STREET A BENEFIT WHICH THERE IS NO TIME TO DISCUSS
HERE STRAY CHILDREN ABOUNDED IN PARIS
THE STATISTICS GIVE AN AVERAGE
OF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOMELESS CHILDREN PICKED UP ANNUALLY AT THAT
PERIOD BY THE POLICE PATROLS IN UNENCLOSED LANDS IN HOUSES IN PROCESS
OF CONSTRUCTION AND UNDER THE ARCHES OF THE BRIDGES
ONE OF THESE
NESTS WHICH HAS BECOME FAMOUS PRODUCED THE SWALLOWS OF THE BRIDGE OF
ARCOLA THIS IS MOREOVER THE MOST DISASTROUS OF SOCIAL SYMPTOMS
ALL
CRIMES OF THE MAN BEGIN IN THE VAGABONDAGE OF THE CHILD
LET US MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN FAVOR OF PARIS NEVERTHELESS
IN A RELATIVE
MEASURE AND IN SPITE OF THE SOUVENIR WHICH WE HAVE JUST RECALLED THE
EXCEPTION IS JUST
WHILE IN ANY OTHER GREAT CITY THE VAGABOND CHILD IS
A LOST MAN WHILE NEARLY EVERYWHERE THE CHILD LEFT TO ITSELF IS IN
SOME SORT SACRIFICED AND ABANDONED TO A KIND OF FATAL IMMERSION IN THE
PUBLIC VICES WHICH DEVOUR IN HIM HONESTY AND CONSCIENCE THE STREET BOY
OF PARIS WE INSIST ON THIS POINT HOWEVER DEFACED AND INJURED ON THE
SURFACE IS ALMOST INTACT ON THE INTERIOR
IT IS A MAGNIFICENT THING TO
PUT ON RECORD AND ONE WHICH SHINES FORTH IN THE SPLENDID PROBITY OF OUR
POPULAR REVOLUTIONS THAT A CERTAIN INCORRUPTIBILITY RESULTS FROM THE
IDEA WHICH EXISTS IN THE AIR OF PARIS AS SALT EXISTS IN THE WATER OF
THE OCEAN
TO BREATHE PARIS PRESERVES THE SOUL
WHAT WE HAVE JUST SAID TAKES AWAY NOTHING OF THE ANGUISH OF HEART WHICH
ONE EXPERIENCES EVERY TIME THAT ONE MEETS ONE OF THESE CHILDREN AROUND
WHOM ONE FANCIES THAT HE BEHOLDS FLOATING THE THREADS OF A BROKEN
FAMILY
IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE PRESENT DAY INCOMPLETE AS IT STILL
IS IT IS NOT A VERY ABNORMAL THING TO BEHOLD THESE FRACTURED FAMILIES
POURING THEMSELVES OUT INTO THE DARKNESS NOT KNOWING CLEARLY WHAT HAS
BECOME OF THEIR CHILDREN AND ALLOWING THEIR OWN ENTRAILS TO FALL ON THE
PUBLIC HIGHWAY
HENCE THESE OBSCURE DESTINIES
THIS IS CALLED FOR THIS
SAD THING HAS GIVEN RISE TO AN EXPRESSION TO BE CAST ON THE PAVEMENTS
OF PARIS
LET IT BE SAID BY THE WAY THAT THIS ABANDONMENT OF CHILDREN WAS NOT
DISCOURAGED BY THE ANCIENT MONARCHY
A LITTLE OF EGYPT AND BOHEMIA IN
THE LOWER REGIONS SUITED THE UPPER SPHERES AND COMPASSED THE AIMS OF
THE POWERFUL
THE HATRED OF INSTRUCTION FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE
WAS A DOGMA
WHAT IS THE USE OF HALF LIGHTS SUCH WAS THE COUNTERSIGN
NOW THE ERRING CHILD IS THE COROLLARY OF THE IGNORANT CHILD
BESIDES THIS THE MONARCHY SOMETIMES WAS IN NEED OF CHILDREN AND IN
THAT CASE IT SKIMMED THE STREETS
UNDER LOUIS XIV NOT TO GO ANY FURTHER BACK THE KING RIGHTLY DESIRED
TO CREATE A FLEET
THE IDEA WAS A GOOD ONE
BUT LET US CONSIDER
THE MEANS
THERE CAN BE NO FLEET IF BESIDE THE SAILING SHIP THAT
PLAYTHING OF THE WINDS AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF TOWING IT IN CASE OF
NECESSITY THERE IS NOT THE VESSEL WHICH GOES WHERE IT PLEASES EITHER
BY MEANS OF OARS OR OF STEAM THE GALLEYS WERE THEN TO THE MARINE WHAT
STEAMERS ARE TO DAY
THEREFORE GALLEYS WERE NECESSARY BUT THE GALLEY
IS MOVED ONLY BY THE GALLEY SLAVE HENCE GALLEY SLAVES WERE REQUIRED
COLBERT HAD THE COMMISSIONERS OF PROVINCES AND THE PARLIAMENTS MAKE
AS MANY CONVICTS AS POSSIBLE
THE MAGISTRACY SHOWED A GREAT DEAL OF
COMPLAISANCE IN THE MATTER
A MAN KEPT HIS HAT ON IN THE PRESENCE OF A
PROCESSION IT WAS A HUGUENOT ATTITUDE HE WAS SENT TO THE GALLEYS
A
CHILD WAS ENCOUNTERED IN THE STREETS PROVIDED THAT HE WAS FIFTEEN
YEARS OF AGE AND DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS TO SLEEP HE WAS SENT TO THE
GALLEYS
GRAND REIGN GRAND CENTURY
UNDER LOUIS XV
CHILDREN DISAPPEARED IN PARIS THE POLICE CARRIED THEM
OFF FOR WHAT MYSTERIOUS PURPOSE NO ONE KNEW
PEOPLE WHISPERED WITH
TERROR MONSTROUS CONJECTURES AS TO THE KING'S BATHS OF PURPLE
BARBIER
SPEAKS INGENUOUSLY OF THESE THINGS
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT THE
EXEMPTS OF THE GUARD WHEN THEY RAN SHORT OF CHILDREN TOOK THOSE WHO
HAD FATHERS
THE FATHERS IN DESPAIR ATTACKED THE EXEMPTS
IN THAT
CASE THE PARLIAMENT INTERVENED AND HAD SOME ONE HUNG
WHO THE EXEMPTS
NO THE FATHERS
CHAPTER VII THE GAMIN SHOULD HAVE HIS PLACE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS OF
INDIA
THE BODY OF STREET ARABS IN PARIS ALMOST CONSTITUTES A CASTE
ONE MIGHT
ALMOST SAY NOT EVERY ONE WHO WISHES TO BELONG TO IT CAN DO SO
THIS WORD GAMIN WAS PRINTED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND REACHED POPULAR
SPEECH THROUGH THE LITERARY TONGUE IN 1834
IT IS IN A LITTLE WORK
ENTITLED CLAUDE GUEUX THAT THIS WORD MADE ITS APPEARANCE
THE HORROR WAS
LIVELY
THE WORD PASSED INTO CIRCULATION
THE ELEMENTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE CONSIDERATION OF THE GAMINS FOR EACH
OTHER ARE VERY VARIOUS
WE HAVE KNOWN AND ASSOCIATED WITH ONE WHO WAS
GREATLY RESPECTED AND VASTLY ADMIRED BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN A MAN FALL FROM
THE TOP OF THE TOWER OF NOTRE DAME ANOTHER BECAUSE HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN
MAKING HIS WAY INTO THE REAR COURTYARD WHERE THE STATUES OF THE DOME
OF THE INVALIDES HAD BEEN TEMPORARILY DEPOSITED AND HAD PRIGGED SOME
LEAD FROM THEM A THIRD BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN A DILIGENCE TIP OVER STILL
ANOTHER BECAUSE HE KNEW A SOLDIER WHO CAME NEAR PUTTING OUT THE EYE
OF A CITIZEN
THIS EXPLAINS THAT FAMOUS EXCLAMATION OF A PARISIAN GAMIN A PROFOUND
EPIPHONEMA WHICH THE VULGAR HERD LAUGHS AT WITHOUT COMPREHENDING DIEU
DE DIEU WHAT ILL LUCK I DO HAVE TO THINK THAT I HAVE NEVER YET SEEN
ANYBODY TUMBLE FROM A FIFTH STORY WINDOW I HAVE PRONOUNCED I'AVE AND
FIFTH PRONOUNCED FIFT'
SURELY THIS SAYING OF A PEASANT IS A FINE ONE FATHER SO AND SO YOUR
WIFE HAS DIED OF HER MALADY WHY DID YOU NOT SEND FOR THE DOCTOR
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SIR WE POOR FOLKS DIE OF OURSELVES BUT IF
THE PEASANT'S WHOLE PASSIVITY LIES IN THIS SAYING THE WHOLE OF THE
FREE THINKING ANARCHY OF THE BRAT OF THE FAUBOURGS IS ASSUREDLY
CONTAINED IN THIS OTHER SAYING
A MAN CONDEMNED TO DEATH IS LISTENING
TO HIS CONFESSOR IN THE TUMBREL
THE CHILD OF PARIS EXCLAIMS HE IS
TALKING TO HIS BLACK CAP OH THE SNEAK
A CERTAIN AUDACITY ON MATTERS OF RELIGION SETS OFF THE GAMIN
TO BE
STRONG MINDED IS AN IMPORTANT ITEM
TO BE PRESENT AT EXECUTIONS CONSTITUTES A DUTY
HE SHOWS HIMSELF AT THE
GUILLOTINE AND HE LAUGHS
HE CALLS IT BY ALL SORTS OF PET NAMES THE
END OF THE SOUP THE GROWLER THE MOTHER IN THE BLUE THE SKY THE LAST
MOUTHFUL ETC ETC
IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE ANYTHING OF THE AFFAIR HE
SCALES THE WALLS HE HOISTS HIMSELF TO BALCONIES HE ASCENDS TREES HE
SUSPENDS HIMSELF TO GRATINGS HE CLINGS FAST TO CHIMNEYS
THE GAMIN IS
BORN A TILER AS HE IS BORN A MARINER
A ROOF INSPIRES HIM WITH NO MORE
FEAR THAN A MAST
THERE IS NO FESTIVAL WHICH COMES UP TO AN EXECUTION
ON THE PLACE DE GREVE
SAMSON AND THE ABBE MONTES ARE THE TRULY POPULAR
NAMES
THEY HOOT AT THE VICTIM IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE HIM
THEY SOMETIMES
ADMIRE HIM
LACENAIRE WHEN A GAMIN ON SEEING THE HIDEOUS DAUTIN DIE
BRAVELY UTTERED THESE WORDS WHICH CONTAIN A FUTURE I WAS JEALOUS OF
HIM IN THE BROTHERHOOD OF GAMINS VOLTAIRE IS NOT KNOWN BUT PAPAVOINE
IS
POLITICIANS ARE CONFUSED WITH ASSASSINS IN THE SAME LEGEND
THEY HAVE A TRADITION AS TO EVERYBODY'S LAST GARMENT
IT IS KNOWN THAT
TOLLERON HAD A FIREMAN'S CAP AVRIL AN OTTER CAP LOSVEL A ROUND HAT
THAT OLD DELAPORTE WAS BALD AND BARE HEADED THAT CASTAING WAS ALL RUDDY
AND VERY HANDSOME THAT BORIES HAD A ROMANTIC SMALL BEARD THAT JEAN
MARTIN KEPT ON HIS SUSPENDERS THAT LECOUFFE AND HIS MOTHER QUARRELLED
DON'T REPROACH EACH OTHER FOR YOUR BASKET SHOUTED A GAMIN TO THEM
ANOTHER IN ORDER TO GET A LOOK AT DEBACKER AS HE PASSED AND BEING TOO
SMALL IN THE CROWD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE LANTERN ON THE QUAY AND CLIMBED
IT
A GENDARME STATIONED OPPOSITE FROWNED
LET ME CLIMB UP M'SIEU LE
GENDARME SAID THE GAMIN
AND TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF THE AUTHORITIES
HE ADDED I WILL NOT FALL I DON'T CARE IF YOU DO RETORTED THE
GENDARME
IN THE BROTHERHOOD OF GAMINS A MEMORABLE ACCIDENT COUNTS FOR A GREAT
DEAL
ONE REACHES THE HEIGHT OF CONSIDERATION IF ONE CHANCES TO CUT
ONE'S SELF VERY DEEPLY TO THE VERY BONE
THE FIST IS NO MEDIOCRE ELEMENT OF RESPECT
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE
GAMIN IS FONDEST OF SAYING IS I AM FINE AND STRONG COME NOW TO BE
LEFT HANDED RENDERS YOU VERY ENVIABLE
A SQUINT IS HIGHLY ESTEEMED
CHAPTER VIII IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARMING SAYING OF THE
LAST KING
IN SUMMER HE METAMORPHOSES HIMSELF INTO A FROG AND IN THE EVENING
WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING IN FRONT OF THE BRIDGES OF AUSTERLITZ AND JENA
FROM THE TOPS OF COAL WAGONS AND THE WASHERWOMEN'S BOATS HE HURLS
HIMSELF HEADLONG INTO THE SEINE AND INTO ALL POSSIBLE INFRACTIONS OF
THE LAWS OF MODESTY AND OF THE POLICE
NEVERTHELESS THE POLICE KEEP AN
EYE ON HIM AND THE RESULT IS A HIGHLY DRAMATIC SITUATION WHICH
ONCE GAVE RISE TO A FRATERNAL AND MEMORABLE CRY THAT CRY WHICH WAS
CELEBRATED ABOUT 1830 IS A STRATEGIC WARNING FROM GAMIN TO GAMIN IT
SCANS LIKE A VERSE FROM HOMER WITH A NOTATION AS INEXPRESSIBLE AS THE
ELEUSIAC CHANT OF THE PANATHENAEA AND IN IT ONE ENCOUNTERS AGAIN THE
ANCIENT EVOHE
HERE IT IS OHE TITI OHEEE HERE COMES THE BOBBY HERE
COMES THE P'LICE PICK UP YOUR DUDS AND BE OFF THROUGH THE SEWER WITH
YOU
SOMETIMES THIS GNAT THAT IS WHAT HE CALLS HIMSELF KNOWS HOW TO READ
SOMETIMES HE KNOWS HOW TO WRITE HE ALWAYS KNOWS HOW TO DAUB
HE
DOES NOT HESITATE TO ACQUIRE BY NO ONE KNOWS WHAT MYSTERIOUS MUTUAL
INSTRUCTION ALL THE TALENTS WHICH CAN BE OF USE TO THE PUBLIC FROM
1815 TO 1830 HE IMITATED THE CRY OF THE TURKEY FROM 1830 TO 1848 HE
SCRAWLED PEARS ON THE WALLS
ONE SUMMER EVENING WHEN LOUIS PHILIPPE WAS
RETURNING HOME ON FOOT HE SAW A LITTLE FELLOW NO HIGHER THAN HIS KNEE
PERSPIRING AND CLIMBING UP TO DRAW A GIGANTIC PEAR IN CHARCOAL ON ONE
OF THE PILLARS OF THE GATE OF NEUILLY THE KING WITH THAT GOOD NATURE
WHICH CAME TO HIM FROM HENRY IV HELPED THE GAMIN FINISHED THE PEAR
AND GAVE THE CHILD A LOUIS SAYING THE PEAR IS ON THAT ALSO 19
THE GAMIN LOVES UPROAR
A CERTAIN STATE OF VIOLENCE PLEASES HIM
HE
EXECRATES THE CURES ONE DAY IN THE RUE DE L'UNIVERSITE ONE OF THESE
SCAMPS WAS PUTTING HIS THUMB TO HIS NOSE AT THE CARRIAGE GATE OF NO
69
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT AT THE GATE A PASSER BY ASKED
THE BOY
REPLIED THERE IS A CURE THERE IT WAS THERE IN FACT THAT THE PAPAL
NUNCIO LIVED
NEVERTHELESS WHATEVER MAY BE THE VOLTAIRIANISM OF THE SMALL GAMIN IF
THE OCCASION TO BECOME A CHORISTER PRESENTS ITSELF IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE
THAT HE WILL ACCEPT AND IN THAT CASE HE SERVES THE MASS CIVILLY
THERE
ARE TWO THINGS TO WHICH HE PLAYS TANTALUS AND WHICH HE ALWAYS DESIRES
WITHOUT EVER ATTAINING THEM TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND TO GET HIS
TROUSERS SEWED UP AGAIN
THE GAMIN IN HIS PERFECT STATE POSSESSES ALL THE POLICEMEN OF PARIS AND
CAN ALWAYS PUT THE NAME TO THE FACE OF ANY ONE WHICH HE CHANCES TO
MEET
HE CAN TELL THEM OFF ON THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS
HE STUDIES THEIR
HABITS AND HE HAS SPECIAL NOTES ON EACH ONE OF THEM
HE READS THE SOULS
OF THE POLICE LIKE AN OPEN BOOK
HE WILL TELL YOU FLUENTLY AND WITHOUT
FLINCHING SUCH AN ONE IS A TRAITOR SUCH ANOTHER IS VERY MALICIOUS
SUCH ANOTHER IS GREAT SUCH ANOTHER IS RIDICULOUS ALL THESE WORDS
TRAITOR MALICIOUS GREAT RIDICULOUS HAVE A PARTICULAR MEANING IN HIS
MOUTH THAT ONE IMAGINES THAT HE OWNS THE PONT NEUF AND HE PREVENTS
PEOPLE FROM WALKING ON THE CORNICE OUTSIDE THE PARAPET THAT OTHER HAS A
MANIA FOR PULLING PERSON'S EARS ETC ETC
CHAPTER IX THE OLD SOUL OF GAUL
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THAT BOY IN POQUELIN THE SON OF THE FISH MARKET
BEAUMARCHAIS HAD SOMETHING OF IT
GAMINERIE IS A SHADE OF THE GALLIC
SPIRIT
MINGLED WITH GOOD SENSE IT SOMETIMES ADDS FORCE TO THE LATTER
AS ALCOHOL DOES TO WINE
SOMETIMES IT IS A DEFECT
HOMER REPEATS HIMSELF
ETERNALLY GRANTED ONE MAY SAY THAT VOLTAIRE PLAYS THE GAMIN
CAMILLE
DESMOULINS WAS A NATIVE OF THE FAUBOURGS
CHAMPIONNET WHO TREATED
MIRACLES BRUTALLY ROSE FROM THE PAVEMENTS OF PARIS HE HAD WHEN A
SMALL LAD INUNDATED THE PORTICOS OF SAINT JEAN DE BEAUVAIS AND OF
SAINT ETIENNE DU MONT HE HAD ADDRESSED THE SHRINE OF SAINTE GENEVIEVE
FAMILIARLY TO GIVE ORDERS TO THE PHIAL OF SAINT JANUARIUS
THE GAMIN OF PARIS IS RESPECTFUL IRONICAL AND INSOLENT
HE HAS
VILLAINOUS TEETH BECAUSE HE IS BADLY FED AND HIS STOMACH SUFFERS AND
HANDSOME EYES BECAUSE HE HAS WIT
IF JEHOVAH HIMSELF WERE PRESENT HE
WOULD GO HOPPING UP THE STEPS OF PARADISE ON ONE FOOT
HE IS STRONG ON
BOXING
ALL BELIEFS ARE POSSIBLE TO HIM
HE PLAYS IN THE GUTTER AND
STRAIGHTENS HIMSELF UP WITH A REVOLT HIS EFFRONTERY PERSISTS EVEN IN
THE PRESENCE OF GRAPE SHOT HE WAS A SCAPEGRACE HE IS A HERO LIKE THE
LITTLE THEBAN HE SHAKES THE SKIN FROM THE LION BARRA THE DRUMMER BOY
WAS A GAMIN OF PARIS HE SHOUTS FORWARD AS THE HORSE OF SCRIPTURE
SAYS VAH AND IN A MOMENT HE HAS PASSED FROM THE SMALL BRAT TO THE
GIANT
THIS CHILD OF THE PUDDLE IS ALSO THE CHILD OF THE IDEAL
MEASURE THAT
SPREAD OF WINGS WHICH REACHES FROM MOLIERE TO BARRA
TO SUM UP THE WHOLE AND IN ONE WORD THE GAMIN IS A BEING WHO AMUSES
HIMSELF BECAUSE HE IS UNHAPPY
CHAPTER X ECCE PARIS ECCE HOMO
TO SUM IT ALL UP ONCE MORE THE PARIS GAMIN OF TO DAY LIKE THE
GRAECULUS OF ROME IN DAYS GONE BY IS THE INFANT POPULACE WITH THE
WRINKLE OF THE OLD WORLD ON HIS BROW
THE GAMIN IS A GRACE TO THE NATION AND AT THE SAME TIME A DISEASE A
DISEASE WHICH MUST BE CURED HOW BY LIGHT
LIGHT RENDERS HEALTHY
LIGHT KINDLES
ALL GENEROUS SOCIAL IRRADIATIONS SPRING FROM SCIENCE LETTERS ARTS
EDUCATION
MAKE MEN MAKE MEN
GIVE THEM LIGHT THAT THEY MAY WARM
YOU
SOONER OR LATER THE SPLENDID QUESTION OF UNIVERSAL EDUCATION WILL
PRESENT ITSELF WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE AUTHORITY OF THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH
AND THEN THOSE WHO GOVERN UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE FRENCH IDEA
WILL HAVE TO MAKE THIS CHOICE THE CHILDREN OF FRANCE OR THE GAMINS OF
PARIS FLAMES IN THE LIGHT OR WILL O' THE WISPS IN THE GLOOM
THE GAMIN EXPRESSES PARIS AND PARIS EXPRESSES THE WORLD
FOR PARIS IS A TOTAL
PARIS IS THE CEILING OF THE HUMAN RACE
THE WHOLE
OF THIS PRODIGIOUS CITY IS A FORESHORTENING OF DEAD MANNERS AND LIVING
MANNERS
HE WHO SEES PARIS THINKS HE SEES THE BOTTOM OF ALL HISTORY WITH
HEAVEN AND CONSTELLATIONS IN THE INTERVALS
PARIS HAS A CAPITAL THE
TOWN HALL A PARTHENON NOTRE DAME A MOUNT AVENTINE THE FAUBOURG
SAINT ANTOINE AN ASINARIUM THE SORBONNE A PANTHEON THE PANTHEON A
VIA SACRA THE BOULEVARD DES ITALIENS A TEMPLE OF THE WINDS OPINION
AND IT REPLACES THE GEMONIAE BY RIDICULE
ITS MAJO IS CALLED FARAUD
ITS TRANSTEVERIN IS THE MAN OF THE FAUBOURGS ITS HAMMAL IS THE
MARKET PORTER ITS LAZZARONE IS THE PEGRE ITS COCKNEY IS THE NATIVE OF
GHENT
EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS ELSEWHERE EXISTS AT PARIS
THE FISHWOMAN
OF DUMARSAIS CAN RETORT ON THE HERB SELLER OF EURIPIDES THE
DISCOBOLS VEJANUS LIVES AGAIN IN THE FORIOSO THE TIGHT ROPE DANCER
THERAPONTIGONUS MILES COULD WALK ARM IN ARM WITH VADEBONCOEUR THE
GRENADIER DAMASIPPUS THE SECOND HAND DEALER WOULD BE HAPPY AMONG
BRIC A BRAC MERCHANTS VINCENNES COULD GRASP SOCRATES IN ITS FIST AS
JUST AS AGORA COULD IMPRISON DIDEROT GRIMOD DE LA REYNIERE DISCOVERED

TRAPEZE WHICH FIGURES IN PLAUTUS REAPPEAR UNDER THE VAULT OF THE ARC

SWORD SWALLOWER ON THE PONT NEUF THE NEPHEW OF RAMEAU AND CURCULIO

A TIGRESS BUT PARDALISCA WAS NOT A DRAGON PANTOLABUS THE WAG JEERS IN
THE CAFE ANGLAIS AT NOMENTANUS THE FAST LIVER HERMOGENUS IS A TENOR
IN THE CHAMPS ELYSEES AND ROUND HIM THRACIUS THE BEGGAR CLAD LIKE
BOBECHE TAKES UP A COLLECTION THE BORE WHO STOPS YOU BY THE BUTTON
OF YOUR COAT IN THE TUILERIES MAKES YOU REPEAT AFTER A LAPSE OF TWO
THOUSAND YEARS THESPRION'S APOSTROPHE QUIS PROPERANTEM ME PREHENDIT
PALLIO THE WINE ON SURENE IS A PARODY OF THE WINE OF ALBA THE RED
BORDER OF DESAUGIERS FORMS A BALANCE TO THE GREAT CUTTING OF BALATRO
PERE LACHAISE EXHALES BENEATH NOCTURNAL RAINS SAME GLEAMS AS THE
ESQUILIAE AND THE GRAVE OF THE POOR BOUGHT FOR FIVE YEARS IS CERTAINLY
THE EQUIVALENT OF THE SLAVE'S HIVED COFFIN
SEEK SOMETHING THAT PARIS HAS NOT
THE VAT OF TROPHONIUS CONTAINS
NOTHING THAT IS NOT IN MESMER'S TUB ERGAPHILAS LIVES AGAIN IN
CAGLIOSTRO THE BRAHMIN VASAPHANTA BECOME INCARNATE IN THE COMTE DE
SAINT GERMAIN THE CEMETERY OF SAINT MEDARD WORKS QUITE AS GOOD MIRACLES
AS THE MOSQUE OF OUMOUMIE AT DAMASCUS
PARIS HAS AN AESOP MAYEUX AND A CANIDIA MADEMOISELLE LENORMAND
IT IS
TERRIFIED LIKE DELPHOS AT THE FULGURATING REALITIES OF THE VISION IT
MAKES TABLES TURN AS DODONA DID TRIPODS
IT PLACES THE GRISETTE ON THE
THRONE AS ROME PLACED THE COURTESAN THERE AND TAKING IT ALTOGETHER
IF LOUIS XV
IS WORSE THAN CLAUDIAN MADAME DUBARRY IS BETTER THAN
MESSALINA
PARIS COMBINES IN AN UNPRECEDENTED TYPE WHICH HAS EXISTED
AND WHICH WE HAVE ELBOWED GRECIAN NUDITY THE HEBRAIC ULCER AND THE
GASCON PUN
IT MINGLES DIOGENES JOB AND JACK PUDDING DRESSES UP A
SPECTRE IN OLD NUMBERS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND MAKES CHODRUC DUCLOS
ALTHOUGH PLUTARCH SAYS THE TYRANT NEVER GROWS OLD ROME UNDER SYLLA AS
UNDER DOMITIAN RESIGNED ITSELF AND WILLINGLY PUT WATER IN ITS WINE
THE
TIBER WAS A LETHE IF THE RATHER DOCTRINARY EULOGIUM MADE OF IT BY VARUS
VIBISCUS IS TO BE CREDITED CONTRA GRACCHOS TIBERIM HABEMUS BIBERE
TIBERIM ID EST SEDITIONEM OBLIVISCI
PARIS DRINKS A MILLION LITRES OF
WATER A DAY BUT THAT DOES NOT PREVENT IT FROM OCCASIONALLY BEATING THE
GENERAL ALARM AND RINGING THE TOCSIN
WITH THAT EXCEPTION PARIS IS AMIABLE
IT ACCEPTS EVERYTHING ROYALLY
IT IS NOT TOO PARTICULAR ABOUT ITS VENUS ITS CALLIPYGE IS HOTTENTOT
PROVIDED THAT IT IS MADE TO LAUGH IT CONDONES UGLINESS CHEERS IT
DEFORMITY PROVOKES IT TO LAUGHTER VICE DIVERTS IT BE ECCENTRIC AND
YOU MAY BE AN ECCENTRIC EVEN HYPOCRISY THAT SUPREME CYNICISM DOES
NOT DISGUST IT IT IS SO LITERARY THAT IT DOES NOT HOLD ITS NOSE BEFORE
BASILE AND IS NO MORE SCANDALIZED BY THE PRAYER OF TARTUFFE THAN HORACE
WAS REPELLED BY THE HICCUP OF PRIAPUS
NO TRAIT OF THE UNIVERSAL FACE
IS LACKING IN THE PROFILE OF PARIS
THE BAL MABILE IS NOT THE POLYMNIA
DANCE OF THE JANICULUM BUT THE DEALER IN LADIES' WEARING APPAREL THERE
DEVOURS THE LORETTE WITH HER EYES EXACTLY AS THE PROCURESS STAPHYLA
LAY IN WAIT FOR THE VIRGIN PLANESIUM
THE BARRIERE DU COMBAT IS NOT
THE COLISEUM BUT PEOPLE ARE AS FEROCIOUS THERE AS THOUGH CAESAR WERE
LOOKING ON
THE SYRIAN HOSTESS HAS MORE GRACE THAN MOTHER SAGUET
BUT IF VIRGIL HAUNTED THE ROMAN WINE SHOP DAVID D'ANGERS BALZAC
AND CHARLET HAVE SAT AT THE TABLES OF PARISIAN TAVERNS
PARIS REIGNS
GENIUSES FLASH FORTH THERE THE RED TAILS PROSPER THERE
ADONAI PASSES
ON HIS CHARIOT WITH ITS TWELVE WHEELS OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING SILENUS
MAKES HIS ENTRY THERE ON HIS ASS
FOR SILENUS READ RAMPONNEAU
PARIS IS THE SYNONYM OF COSMOS PARIS IS ATHENS SYBARIS JERUSALEM
PANTIN
ALL CIVILIZATIONS ARE THERE IN AN ABRIDGED FORM ALL BARBARISMS
ALSO
PARIS WOULD GREATLY REGRET IT IF IT HAD NOT A GUILLOTINE
A LITTLE OF THE PLACE DE GREVE IS A GOOD THING
WHAT WOULD ALL THAT
ETERNAL FESTIVAL BE WITHOUT THIS SEASONING OUR LAWS ARE WISELY
PROVIDED AND THANKS TO THEM THIS BLADE DRIPS ON THIS SHROVE TUESDAY
CHAPTER XI TO SCOFF TO REIGN
THERE IS NO LIMIT TO PARIS
NO CITY HAS HAD THAT DOMINATION WHICH
SOMETIMES DERIDES THOSE WHOM IT SUBJUGATES
TO PLEASE YOU O ATHENIANS
EXCLAIMED ALEXANDER
PARIS MAKES MORE THAN THE LAW IT MAKES THE
FASHION PARIS SETS MORE THAN THE FASHION IT SETS THE ROUTINE
PARIS
MAY BE STUPID IF IT SEES FIT IT SOMETIMES ALLOWS ITSELF THIS LUXURY
THEN THE UNIVERSE IS STUPID IN COMPANY WITH IT THEN PARIS AWAKES RUBS
ITS EYES SAYS HOW STUPID I AM AND BURSTS OUT LAUGHING IN THE FACE
OF THE HUMAN RACE
WHAT A MARVEL IS SUCH A CITY IT IS A STRANGE THING
THAT THIS GRANDIOSENESS AND THIS BURLESQUE SHOULD BE AMICABLE NEIGHBORS
THAT ALL THIS MAJESTY SHOULD NOT BE THROWN INTO DISORDER BY ALL THIS
PARODY AND THAT THE SAME MOUTH CAN TO DAY BLOW INTO THE TRUMP OF THE
JUDGMENT DAY AND TO MORROW INTO THE REED FLUTE PARIS HAS A SOVEREIGN
JOVIALITY
ITS GAYETY IS OF THE THUNDER AND ITS FARCE HOLDS A SCEPTRE
ITS TEMPEST SOMETIMES PROCEEDS FROM A GRIMACE
ITS EXPLOSIONS ITS DAYS
ITS MASTERPIECES ITS PRODIGIES ITS EPICS GO FORTH TO THE BOUNDS OF
THE UNIVERSE AND SO ALSO DO ITS COCK AND BULL STORIES
ITS LAUGH IS THE
MOUTH OF A VOLCANO WHICH SPATTERS THE WHOLE EARTH
ITS JESTS ARE SPARKS
IT IMPOSES ITS CARICATURES AS WELL AS ITS IDEAL ON PEOPLE THE HIGHEST
MONUMENTS OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION ACCEPT ITS IRONIES AND LEND THEIR
ETERNITY TO ITS MISCHIEVOUS PRANKS
IT IS SUPERB IT HAS A PRODIGIOUS
14TH OF JULY WHICH DELIVERS THE GLOBE IT FORCES ALL NATIONS TO TAKE
THE OATH OF TENNIS ITS NIGHT OF THE 4TH OF AUGUST DISSOLVES IN THREE
HOURS A THOUSAND YEARS OF FEUDALISM IT MAKES OF ITS LOGIC THE MUSCLE
OF UNANIMOUS WILL IT MULTIPLIES ITSELF UNDER ALL SORTS OF FORMS OF
THE SUBLIME IT FILLS WITH ITS LIGHT WASHINGTON KOSCIUSKO BOLIVAR
BOZZARIS RIEGO BEM MANIN LOPEZ JOHN BROWN GARIBALDI IT IS
EVERYWHERE WHERE THE FUTURE IS BEING LIGHTED UP AT BOSTON IN 1779
AT THE ISLE DE LEON IN 1820 AT PESTH IN 1848 AT PALERMO IN 1860 IT
WHISPERS THE MIGHTY COUNTERSIGN LIBERTY IN THE EAR OF THE AMERICAN
ABOLITIONISTS GROUPED ABOUT THE BOAT AT HARPER'S FERRY AND IN THE EAR
OF THE PATRIOTS OF ANCONA ASSEMBLED IN THE SHADOW TO THE ARCHI BEFORE
THE GOZZI INN ON THE SEASHORE IT CREATES CANARIS IT CREATES QUIROGA
IT CREATES PISACANE IT IRRADIATES THE GREAT ON EARTH IT WAS WHILE
PROCEEDING WHITHER ITS BREATH URGE THEM THAT BYRON PERISHED AT
MISSOLONGHI AND THAT MAZET DIED AT BARCELONA IT IS THE TRIBUNE UNDER
THE FEET OF MIRABEAU AND A CRATER UNDER THE FEET OF ROBESPIERRE
ITS BOOKS ITS THEATRE ITS ART ITS SCIENCE ITS LITERATURE ITS
PHILOSOPHY ARE THE MANUALS OF THE HUMAN RACE IT HAS PASCAL REGNIER
CORNEILLE DESCARTES JEAN JACQUES VOLTAIRE FOR ALL MOMENTS MOLIERE
FOR ALL CENTURIES IT MAKES ITS LANGUAGE TO BE TALKED BY THE UNIVERSAL
MOUTH AND THAT LANGUAGE BECOMES THE WORD IT CONSTRUCTS IN ALL MINDS
THE IDEA OF PROGRESS THE LIBERATING DOGMAS WHICH IT FORGES ARE FOR THE
GENERATIONS TRUSTY FRIENDS AND IT IS WITH THE SOUL OF ITS THINKERS AND
ITS POETS THAT ALL HEROES OF ALL NATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE 1789 THIS
DOES NOT PREVENT VAGABONDISM AND THAT ENORMOUS GENIUS WHICH IS CALLED
PARIS WHILE TRANSFIGURING THE WORLD BY ITS LIGHT SKETCHES IN CHARCOAL
BOUGINIER'S NOSE ON THE WALL OF THE TEMPLE OF THESEUS AND WRITES
CREDEVILLE THE THIEF ON THE PYRAMIDS
PARIS IS ALWAYS SHOWING ITS TEETH WHEN IT IS NOT SCOLDING IT IS
LAUGHING
SUCH IS PARIS
THE SMOKE OF ITS ROOFS FORMS THE IDEAS OF THE UNIVERSE
A
HEAP OF MUD AND STONE IF YOU WILL BUT ABOVE ALL A MORAL BEING
IT IS
MORE THAN GREAT IT IS IMMENSE
WHY BECAUSE IT IS DARING
TO DARE THAT IS THE PRICE OF PROGRESS
ALL SUBLIME CONQUESTS ARE MORE OR LESS THE PRIZES OF DARING
IN
ORDER THAT THE REVOLUTION SHOULD TAKE PLACE IT DOES NOT SUFFICE THAT
MONTESQUIEU SHOULD FORESEE IT THAT DIDEROT SHOULD PREACH IT THAT
BEAUMARCHAIS SHOULD ANNOUNCE IT THAT CONDORCET SHOULD CALCULATE IT
THAT AROUET SHOULD PREPARE IT THAT ROUSSEAU SHOULD PREMEDITATE IT IT
IS NECESSARY THAT DANTON SHOULD DARE IT
THE CRY AUDACITY IS A FIAT LUX
IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE SAKE OF THE
FORWARD MARCH OF THE HUMAN RACE THAT THERE SHOULD BE PROUD LESSONS OF
COURAGE PERMANENTLY ON THE HEIGHTS
DARING DEEDS DAZZLE HISTORY AND ARE
ONE OF MAN'S GREAT SOURCES OF LIGHT
THE DAWN DARES WHEN IT RISES
TO
ATTEMPT TO BRAVE TO PERSIST TO PERSEVERE TO BE FAITHFUL TO ONE'S
SELF TO GRASP FATE BODILY TO ASTOUND CATASTROPHE BY THE SMALL AMOUNT
OF FEAR THAT IT OCCASIONS US NOW TO AFFRONT UNJUST POWER AGAIN TO
INSULT DRUNKEN VICTORY TO HOLD ONE'S POSITION TO STAND ONE'S GROUND
THAT IS THE EXAMPLE WHICH NATIONS NEED THAT IS THE LIGHT WHICH
ELECTRIFIES THEM
THE SAME FORMIDABLE LIGHTNING PROCEEDS FROM THE TORCH
OF PROMETHEUS TO CAMBRONNE'S SHORT PIPE
CHAPTER XII THE FUTURE LATENT IN THE PEOPLE
AS FOR THE PARISIAN POPULACE EVEN WHEN A MAN GROWN IT IS ALWAYS THE
STREET ARAB TO PAINT THE CHILD IS TO PAINT THE CITY AND IT IS FOR THAT
REASON THAT WE HAVE STUDIED THIS EAGLE IN THIS ARRANT SPARROW
IT IS IN
THE FAUBOURGS ABOVE ALL WE MAINTAIN THAT THE PARISIAN RACE APPEARS
THERE IS THE PURE BLOOD THERE IS THE TRUE PHYSIOGNOMY THERE THIS
PEOPLE TOILS AND SUFFERS AND SUFFERING AND TOIL ARE THE TWO FACES OF
MAN
THERE EXIST THERE IMMENSE NUMBERS OF UNKNOWN BEINGS AMONG WHOM
SWARM TYPES OF THE STRANGEST FROM THE PORTER OF LA RAPEE TO THE KNACKER
OF MONTFAUCON
FEX URBIS EXCLAIMS CICERO MOB ADDS BURKE INDIGNANTLY
RABBLE MULTITUDE POPULACE
THESE ARE WORDS AND QUICKLY UTTERED
BUT
SO BE IT
WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT IS IT TO ME IF THEY DO GO BAREFOOT
THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO READ SO MUCH THE WORSE
WOULD YOU ABANDON THEM
FOR THAT WOULD YOU TURN THEIR DISTRESS INTO A MALEDICTION CANNOT THE
LIGHT PENETRATE THESE MASSES LET US RETURN TO THAT CRY LIGHT AND LET
US OBSTINATELY PERSIST THEREIN LIGHT LIGHT WHO KNOWS WHETHER

CHAPTER XIII LITTLE GAVROCHE
ILLUSTRATION LITTLE GAVROCHE 3B1 13 GAVROCHE
EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AFTER THE EVENTS NARRATED IN THE SECOND PART OF THIS
STORY PEOPLE NOTICED ON THE BOULEVARD DU TEMPLE AND IN THE REGIONS OF
THE CHATEAU D'EAU A LITTLE BOY ELEVEN OR TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WHO WOULD
HAVE REALIZED WITH TOLERABLE ACCURACY THAT IDEAL OF THE GAMIN SKETCHED
OUT ABOVE IF WITH THE LAUGH OF HIS AGE ON HIS LIPS HE HAD NOT HAD A
HEART ABSOLUTELY SOMBRE AND EMPTY
THIS CHILD WAS WELL MUFFLED UP IN A
PAIR OF MAN'S TROUSERS BUT HE DID NOT GET THEM FROM HIS FATHER AND A
WOMAN'S CHEMISE BUT HE DID NOT GET IT FROM HIS MOTHER
SOME PEOPLE OR
OTHER HAD CLOTHED HIM IN RAGS OUT OF CHARITY
STILL HE HAD A FATHER AND
A MOTHER
BUT HIS FATHER DID NOT THINK OF HIM AND HIS MOTHER DID NOT
LOVE HIM
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN MOST DESERVING OF PITY AMONG ALL ONE OF
THOSE WHO HAVE FATHER AND MOTHER AND WHO ARE ORPHANS NEVERTHELESS
THIS CHILD NEVER FELT SO WELL AS WHEN HE WAS IN THE STREET
THE
PAVEMENTS WERE LESS HARD TO HIM THAN HIS MOTHER'S HEART
HIS PARENTS HAD DESPATCHED HIM INTO LIFE WITH A KICK
HE SIMPLY TOOK FLIGHT
HE WAS A BOISTEROUS PALLID NIMBLE WIDE AWAKE JEERING LAD WITH A
VIVACIOUS BUT SICKLY AIR
HE WENT AND CAME SANG PLAYED AT HOPSCOTCH
SCRAPED THE GUTTERS STOLE A LITTLE BUT LIKE CATS AND SPARROWS GAYLY
LAUGHED WHEN HE WAS CALLED A ROGUE AND GOT ANGRY WHEN CALLED A THIEF
HE HAD NO SHELTER NO BREAD NO FIRE NO LOVE BUT HE WAS MERRY BECAUSE
HE WAS FREE
WHEN THESE POOR CREATURES GROW TO BE MEN THE MILLSTONES OF THE SOCIAL
ORDER MEET THEM AND CRUSH THEM BUT SO LONG AS THEY ARE CHILDREN THEY
ESCAPE BECAUSE OF THEIR SMALLNESS
THE TINIEST HOLE SAVES THEM
NEVERTHELESS ABANDONED AS THIS CHILD WAS IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED EVERY
TWO OR THREE MONTHS THAT HE SAID COME I'LL GO AND SEE MAMMA THEN
HE QUITTED THE BOULEVARD THE CIRQUE THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN DESCENDED
TO THE QUAYS CROSSED THE BRIDGES REACHED THE SUBURBS ARRIVED AT THE
SALPETRIERE AND CAME TO A HALT WHERE PRECISELY AT THAT DOUBLE NUMBER
50 52 WITH WHICH THE READER IS ACQUAINTED AT THE GORBEAU HOVEL
AT THAT EPOCH THE HOVEL 50 52 GENERALLY DESERTED AND ETERNALLY
DECORATED WITH THE PLACARD CHAMBERS TO LET CHANCED TO BE A RARE
THING INHABITED BY NUMEROUS INDIVIDUALS WHO HOWEVER AS IS ALWAYS THE
CASE IN PARIS HAD NO CONNECTION WITH EACH OTHER
ALL BELONGED TO
THAT INDIGENT CLASS WHICH BEGINS TO SEPARATE FROM THE LOWEST OF PETTY
BOURGEOISIE IN STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHICH EXTENDS FROM MISERY
TO MISERY INTO THE LOWEST DEPTHS OF SOCIETY DOWN TO THOSE TWO BEINGS
IN WHOM ALL THE MATERIAL THINGS OF CIVILIZATION END THE SEWER MAN WHO
SWEEPS UP THE MUD AND THE RAGPICKER WHO COLLECTS SCRAPS
THE PRINCIPAL LODGER OF JEAN VALJEAN'S DAY WAS DEAD AND HAD BEEN
REPLACED BY ANOTHER EXACTLY LIKE HER
I KNOW NOT WHAT PHILOSOPHER HAS
SAID OLD WOMEN ARE NEVER LACKING
THIS NEW OLD WOMAN WAS NAMED MADAME BOURGON AND HAD NOTHING REMARKABLE
ABOUT HER LIFE EXCEPT A DYNASTY OF THREE PAROQUETS WHO HAD REIGNED IN
SUCCESSION OVER HER SOUL
THE MOST MISERABLE OF THOSE WHO INHABITED THE HOVEL WERE A FAMILY OF
FOUR PERSONS CONSISTING OF FATHER MOTHER AND TWO DAUGHTERS ALREADY
WELL GROWN ALL FOUR OF WHOM WERE LODGED IN THE SAME ATTIC ONE OF THE
CELLS WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED
AT FIRST SIGHT THIS FAMILY PRESENTED NO VERY SPECIAL FEATURE EXCEPT ITS
EXTREME DESTITUTION THE FATHER WHEN HE HIRED THE CHAMBER HAD STATED
THAT HIS NAME WAS JONDRETTE
SOME TIME AFTER HIS MOVING IN WHICH HAD
BORNE A SINGULAR RESEMBLANCE TO THE ENTRANCE OF NOTHING AT ALL TO
BORROW THE MEMORABLE EXPRESSION OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANT THIS JONDRETTE
HAD SAID TO THE WOMAN WHO LIKE HER PREDECESSOR WAS AT THE SAME TIME
PORTRESS AND STAIR SWEEPER MOTHER SO AND SO IF ANY ONE SHOULD CHANCE
TO COME AND INQUIRE FOR A POLE OR AN ITALIAN OR EVEN A SPANIARD
PERCHANCE IT IS I
THIS FAMILY WAS THAT OF THE MERRY BAREFOOT BOY
HE ARRIVED THERE AND
FOUND DISTRESS AND WHAT IS STILL SADDER NO SMILE A COLD HEARTH
AND COLD HEARTS
WHEN HE ENTERED HE WAS ASKED WHENCE COME YOU HE
REPLIED FROM THE STREET WHEN HE WENT AWAY THEY ASKED HIM WHITHER
ARE YOU GOING HE REPLIED INTO THE STREETS HIS MOTHER SAID TO HIM
WHAT DID YOU COME HERE FOR
THIS CHILD LIVED IN THIS ABSENCE OF AFFECTION LIKE THE PALE PLANTS
WHICH SPRING UP IN CELLARS
IT DID NOT CAUSE HIM SUFFERING AND HE
BLAMED NO ONE
HE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW A FATHER AND MOTHER SHOULD
BE
NEVERTHELESS HIS MOTHER LOVED HIS SISTERS
WE HAVE FORGOTTEN TO MENTION THAT ON THE BOULEVARD DU TEMPLE THIS CHILD
WAS CALLED LITTLE GAVROCHE
WHY WAS HE CALLED LITTLE GAVROCHE
PROBABLY BECAUSE HIS FATHER'S NAME WAS JONDRETTE
IT SEEMS TO BE THE INSTINCT OF CERTAIN WRETCHED FAMILIES TO BREAK THE
THREAD
THE CHAMBER WHICH THE JONDRETTES INHABITED IN THE GORBEAU HOVEL WAS THE
LAST AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR
THE CELL NEXT TO IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A
VERY POOR YOUNG MAN WHO WAS CALLED M
MARIUS
LET US EXPLAIN WHO THIS M
MARIUS WAS
BOOK SECOND THE GREAT BOURGEOIS
CHAPTER I NINETY YEARS AND THIRTY TWO TEETH
IN THE RUE BOUCHERAT RUE DE NORMANDIE AND THE RUE DE SAINTONGE THERE
STILL EXIST A FEW ANCIENT INHABITANTS WHO HAVE PRESERVED THE MEMORY OF A
WORTHY MAN NAMED M
GILLENORMAND AND WHO MENTION HIM WITH COMPLAISANCE
THIS GOOD MAN WAS OLD WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG
THIS SILHOUETTE HAS NOT YET
ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED FOR THOSE WHO REGARD WITH MELANCHOLY THAT VAGUE
SWARM OF SHADOWS WHICH IS CALLED THE PAST FROM THE LABYRINTH OF STREETS
IN THE VICINITY OF THE TEMPLE TO WHICH UNDER LOUIS XIV THE NAMES OF
ALL THE PROVINCES OF FRANCE WERE APPENDED EXACTLY AS IN OUR DAY THE
STREETS OF THE NEW TIVOLI QUARTER HAVE RECEIVED THE NAMES OF ALL THE
CAPITALS OF EUROPE A PROGRESSION BY THE WAY IN WHICH PROGRESS IS
VISIBLE
M GILLENORMAND WHO WAS AS MUCH ALIVE AS POSSIBLE IN 1831 WAS ONE OF
THOSE MEN WHO HAD BECOME CURIOSITIES TO BE VIEWED SIMPLY BECAUSE
THEY HAVE LIVED A LONG TIME AND WHO ARE STRANGE BECAUSE THEY FORMERLY
RESEMBLED EVERYBODY AND NOW RESEMBLE NOBODY
HE WAS A PECULIAR OLD MAN
AND IN VERY TRUTH A MAN OF ANOTHER AGE THE REAL COMPLETE AND RATHER
HAUGHTY BOURGEOIS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WHO WORE HIS GOOD OLD
BOURGEOISIE WITH THE AIR WITH WHICH MARQUISES WEAR THEIR MARQUISATES
HE
WAS OVER NINETY YEARS OF AGE HIS WALK WAS ERECT HE TALKED LOUDLY SAW
CLEARLY DRANK NEAT ATE SLEPT AND SNORED
HE HAD ALL THIRTY TWO OF
HIS TEETH
HE ONLY WORE SPECTACLES WHEN HE READ
HE WAS OF AN AMOROUS
DISPOSITION BUT DECLARED THAT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS HE HAD WHOLLY
AND DECIDEDLY RENOUNCED WOMEN
HE COULD NO LONGER PLEASE HE SAID HE
DID NOT ADD I AM TOO OLD BUT I AM TOO POOR HE SAID IF I WERE
NOT RUINED HEEE ALL HE HAD LEFT IN FACT WAS AN INCOME OF ABOUT
FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
HIS DREAM WAS TO COME INTO AN INHERITANCE AND
TO HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVRES INCOME FOR MISTRESSES
HE DID
NOT BELONG AS THE READER WILL PERCEIVE TO THAT PUNY VARIETY OF
OCTOGENARIES WHO LIKE M
DE VOLTAIRE HAVE BEEN DYING ALL THEIR LIFE
HIS WAS NO LONGEVITY OF A CRACKED POT THIS JOVIAL OLD MAN HAD ALWAYS
HAD GOOD HEALTH
HE WAS SUPERFICIAL RAPID EASILY ANGERED
HE FLEW INTO
A PASSION AT EVERYTHING GENERALLY QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL REASON
WHEN
CONTRADICTED HE RAISED HIS CANE HE BEAT PEOPLE AS HE HAD DONE IN THE
GREAT CENTURY
HE HAD A DAUGHTER OVER FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND UNMARRIED
WHOM HE CHASTISED SEVERELY WITH HIS TONGUE WHEN IN A RAGE AND WHOM HE
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO WHIP
SHE SEEMED TO HIM TO BE EIGHT YEARS OLD
HE
BOXED HIS SERVANTS' EARS SOUNDLY AND SAID AH CAROGNE ONE OF HIS
OATHS WAS BY THE PANTOUFLOCHE OF THE PANTOUFLOCHADE HE HAD SINGULAR
FREAKS OF TRANQUILLITY HE HAD HIMSELF SHAVED EVERY DAY BY A BARBER WHO
HAD BEEN MAD AND WHO DETESTED HIM BEING JEALOUS OF M
GILLENORMAND ON
ACCOUNT OF HIS WIFE A PRETTY AND COQUETTISH BARBERESS
M
GILLENORMAND
ADMIRED HIS OWN DISCERNMENT IN ALL THINGS AND DECLARED THAT HE WAS
EXTREMELY SAGACIOUS HERE IS ONE OF HIS SAYINGS I HAVE IN TRUTH SOME
PENETRATION I AM ABLE TO SAY WHEN A FLEA BITES ME FROM WHAT WOMAN IT
CAME
THE WORDS WHICH HE UTTERED THE MOST FREQUENTLY WERE THE SENSIBLE MAN
AND NATURE
HE DID NOT GIVE TO THIS LAST WORD THE GRAND ACCEPTATION
WHICH OUR EPOCH HAS ACCORDED TO IT BUT HE MADE IT ENTER AFTER HIS OWN
FASHION INTO HIS LITTLE CHIMNEY CORNER SATIRES NATURE HE SAID IN
ORDER THAT CIVILIZATION MAY HAVE A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING GIVES IT EVEN
SPECIMENS OF ITS AMUSING BARBARISM
EUROPE POSSESSES SPECIMENS OF ASIA
AND AFRICA ON A SMALL SCALE
THE CAT IS A DRAWING ROOM TIGER THE LIZARD
IS A POCKET CROCODILE
THE DANCERS AT THE OPERA ARE PINK FEMALE SAVAGES
THEY DO NOT EAT MEN THEY CRUNCH THEM OR MAGICIANS THAT THEY ARE THEY
TRANSFORM THEM INTO OYSTERS AND SWALLOW THEM
THE CARIBBEANS LEAVE ONLY
THE BONES THEY LEAVE ONLY THE SHELL
SUCH ARE OUR MORALS
WE DO NOT
DEVOUR WE GNAW WE DO NOT EXTERMINATE WE CLAW
CHAPTER II LIKE MASTER LIKE HOUSE
HE LIVED IN THE MARAIS RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE NO
6
HE OWNED THE
HOUSE
THIS HOUSE HAS SINCE BEEN DEMOLISHED AND REBUILT AND THE NUMBER
HAS PROBABLY BEEN CHANGED IN THOSE REVOLUTIONS OF NUMERATION WHICH THE
STREETS OF PARIS UNDERGO
HE OCCUPIED AN ANCIENT AND VAST APARTMENT
ON THE FIRST FLOOR BETWEEN STREET AND GARDENS FURNISHED TO THE VERY
CEILINGS WITH GREAT GOBELINS AND BEAUVAIS TAPESTRIES REPRESENTING
PASTORAL SCENES THE SUBJECTS OF THE CEILINGS AND THE PANELS WERE
REPEATED IN MINIATURE ON THE ARM CHAIRS
HE ENVELOPED HIS BED IN A VAST
NINE LEAVED SCREEN OF COROMANDEL LACQUER
LONG FULL CURTAINS HUNG FROM
THE WINDOWS AND FORMED GREAT BROKEN FOLDS THAT WERE VERY MAGNIFICENT
THE GARDEN SITUATED IMMEDIATELY UNDER HIS WINDOWS WAS ATTACHED TO THAT
ONE OF THEM WHICH FORMED THE ANGLE BY MEANS OF A STAIRCASE TWELVE OR
FIFTEEN STEPS LONG WHICH THE OLD GENTLEMAN ASCENDED AND DESCENDED WITH
GREAT AGILITY
IN ADDITION TO A LIBRARY ADJOINING HIS CHAMBER HE HAD A
BOUDOIR OF WHICH HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL A GALLANT AND ELEGANT RETREAT
WITH MAGNIFICENT HANGINGS OF STRAW WITH A PATTERN OF FLOWERS AND
FLEURS DE LYS MADE ON THE GALLEYS OF LOUIS XIV
AND ORDERED OF HIS
CONVICTS BY M
DE VIVONNE FOR HIS MISTRESS
M
GILLENORMAND HAD
INHERITED IT FROM A GRIM MATERNAL GREAT AUNT WHO HAD DIED A
CENTENARIAN
HE HAD HAD TWO WIVES
HIS MANNERS WERE SOMETHING BETWEEN
THOSE OF THE COURTIER WHICH HE HAD NEVER BEEN AND THE LAWYER WHICH
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
HE WAS GAY AND CARESSING WHEN HE HAD A MIND
IN
HIS YOUTH HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO ARE ALWAYS DECEIVED BY THEIR
WIVES AND NEVER BY THEIR MISTRESSES BECAUSE THEY ARE AT THE SAME
TIME THE MOST SULLEN OF HUSBANDS AND THE MOST CHARMING OF LOVERS IN
EXISTENCE
HE WAS A CONNOISSEUR OF PAINTING
HE HAD IN HIS CHAMBER A
MARVELLOUS PORTRAIT OF NO ONE KNOWS WHOM PAINTED BY JORDAENS EXECUTED
WITH GREAT DASHES OF THE BRUSH WITH MILLIONS OF DETAILS IN A CONFUSED
AND HAP HAZARD MANNER
M
GILLENORMAND'S ATTIRE WAS NOT THE HABIT OF
LOUIS XIV
NOR YET THAT OF LOUIS XVI IT WAS THAT OF THE INCROYABLES
OF THE DIRECTORY
HE HAD THOUGHT HIMSELF YOUNG UP TO THAT PERIOD AND
HAD FOLLOWED THE FASHIONS
HIS COAT WAS OF LIGHT WEIGHT CLOTH WITH
VOLUMINOUS REVERS A LONG SWALLOW TAIL AND LARGE STEEL BUTTONS
WITH
THIS HE WORE KNEE BREECHES AND BUCKLE SHOES
HE ALWAYS THRUST HIS HANDS
INTO HIS FOBS
HE SAID AUTHORITATIVELY THE FRENCH REVOLUTION IS A HEAP
OF BLACKGUARDS
CHAPTER III LUC ESPRIT
AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN ONE EVENING AT THE OPERA HE HAD HAD THE HONOR
TO BE STARED AT THROUGH OPERA GLASSES BY TWO BEAUTIES AT THE SAME
TIME RIPE AND CELEBRATED BEAUTIES THEN AND SUNG BY VOLTAIRE THE
CAMARGO AND THE SALLE
CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO FIRES HE HAD BEATEN A HEROIC
RETREAT TOWARDS A LITTLE DANCER A YOUNG GIRL NAMED NAHENRY WHO WAS
SIXTEEN LIKE HIMSELF OBSCURE AS A CAT AND WITH WHOM HE WAS IN LOVE
HE ABOUNDED IN MEMORIES
HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO EXCLAIM HOW PRETTY SHE
WAS THAT GUIMARD GUIMARDINI GUIMARDINETTE THE LAST TIME I SAW HER
AT LONGCHAMPS HER HAIR CURLED IN SUSTAINED SENTIMENTS WITH HER
COME AND SEE OF TURQUOISES HER GOWN OF THE COLOR OF PERSONS NEWLY
ARRIVED AND HER LITTLE AGITATION MUFF HE HAD WORN IN HIS YOUNG
MANHOOD A WAISTCOAT OF NAIN LONDRIN WHICH HE WAS FOND OF TALKING ABOUT
EFFUSIVELY
I WAS DRESSED LIKE A TURK OF THE LEVANT LEVANTIN SAID HE
MADAME DE BOUFFLERS HAVING SEEN HIM BY CHANCE WHEN HE WAS TWENTY HAD
DESCRIBED HIM AS A CHARMING FOOL HE WAS HORRIFIED BY ALL THE NAMES
WHICH HE SAW IN POLITICS AND IN POWER REGARDING THEM AS VULGAR AND
BOURGEOIS
HE READ THE JOURNALS THE NEWSPAPERS THE GAZETTES AS HE
SAID STIFLING OUTBURSTS OF LAUGHTER THE WHILE
OH HE SAID WHAT
PEOPLE THESE ARE CORBIERE HUMANN CASIMIR PERIER THERE'S A MINISTER
FOR YOU I CAN IMAGINE THIS IN A JOURNAL 'M
GILLENORMAN MINISTER
THAT WOULD BE A FARCE
WELL THEY ARE SO STUPID THAT IT WOULD PASS HE
MERRILY CALLED EVERYTHING BY ITS NAME WHETHER DECENT OR INDECENT AND
DID NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF IN THE LEAST BEFORE LADIES
HE UTTERED COARSE
SPEECHES OBSCENITIES AND FILTH WITH A CERTAIN TRANQUILLITY AND LACK
OF ASTONISHMENT WHICH WAS ELEGANT
IT WAS IN KEEPING WITH THE
UNCEREMONIOUSNESS OF HIS CENTURY
IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT THE AGE OF
PERIPHRASE IN VERSE WAS THE AGE OF CRUDITIES IN PROSE
HIS GOD FATHER
HAD PREDICTED THAT HE WOULD TURN OUT A MAN OF GENIUS AND HAD BESTOWED
ON HIM THESE TWO SIGNIFICANT NAMES LUC ESPRIT
CHAPTER IV A CENTENARIAN ASPIRANT
HE HAD TAKEN PRIZES IN HIS BOYHOOD AT THE COLLEGE OF MOULINS WHERE HE
WAS BORN AND HE HAD BEEN CROWNED BY THE HAND OF THE DUC DE NIVERNAIS
WHOM HE CALLED THE DUC DE NEVERS
NEITHER THE CONVENTION NOR THE DEATH
OF LOUIS XVI NOR THE NAPOLEON NOR THE RETURN OF THE BOURBONS NOR
ANYTHING ELSE HAD BEEN ABLE TO EFFACE THE MEMORY OF THIS CROWNING
THE
DUC DE NEVERS WAS IN HIS EYES THE GREAT FIGURE OF THE CENTURY
WHAT A
CHARMING GRAND SEIGNEUR HE SAID AND WHAT A FINE AIR HE HAD WITH HIS
BLUE RIBBON
IN THE EYES OF M
GILLENORMAND CATHERINE THE SECOND HAD MADE REPARATION
FOR THE CRIME OF THE PARTITION OF POLAND BY PURCHASING FOR THREE
THOUSAND ROUBLES THE SECRET OF THE ELIXIR OF GOLD FROM BESTUCHEFF
HE
GREW ANIMATED ON THIS SUBJECT THE ELIXIR OF GOLD HE EXCLAIMED THE
YELLOW DYE OF BESTUCHEFF GENERAL LAMOTTE'S DROPS IN THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY THIS WAS THE GREAT REMEDY FOR THE CATASTROPHES OF LOVE THE
PANACEA AGAINST VENUS AT ONE LOUIS THE HALF OUNCE PHIAL
LOUIS XV
SENT TWO HUNDRED PHIALS OF IT TO THE POPE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY
IRRITATED AND THROWN OFF HIS BALANCE HAD ANY ONE TOLD HIM THAT THE
ELIXIR OF GOLD IS NOTHING BUT THE PERCHLORIDE OF IRON
M
GILLENORMAND
ADORED THE BOURBONS AND HAD A HORROR OF 1789 HE WAS FOREVER NARRATING
IN WHAT MANNER HE HAD SAVED HIMSELF DURING THE TERROR AND HOW HE HAD
BEEN OBLIGED TO DISPLAY A VAST DEAL OF GAYETY AND CLEVERNESS IN ORDER TO
ESCAPE HAVING HIS HEAD CUT OFF
IF ANY YOUNG MAN VENTURED TO PRONOUNCE
AN EULOGIUM ON THE REPUBLIC IN HIS PRESENCE HE TURNED PURPLE AND GREW
SO ANGRY THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF SWOONING
HE SOMETIMES ALLUDED TO
HIS NINETY YEARS AND SAID I HOPE THAT I SHALL NOT SEE NINETY THREE
TWICE ON THESE OCCASIONS HE HINTED TO PEOPLE THAT HE MEANT TO LIVE TO
BE A HUNDRED
CHAPTER V BASQUE AND NICOLETTE
HE HAD THEORIES
HERE IS ONE OF THEM WHEN A MAN IS PASSIONATELY FOND
OF WOMEN AND WHEN HE HAS HIMSELF A WIFE FOR WHOM HE CARES BUT LITTLE
WHO IS HOMELY CROSS LEGITIMATE WITH PLENTY OF RIGHTS PERCHED ON THE
CODE AND JEALOUS AT NEED THERE IS BUT ONE WAY OF EXTRICATING HIMSELF
FROM THE QUANDRY AND OF PROCURING PEACE AND THAT IS TO LET HIS WIFE
CONTROL THE PURSE STRINGS
THIS ABDICATION SETS HIM FREE
THEN HIS
WIFE BUSIES HERSELF GROWS PASSIONATELY FOND OF HANDLING COIN GETS HER
FINGERS COVERED WITH VERDIGRIS IN THE PROCESS UNDERTAKES THE EDUCATION
OF HALF SHARE TENANTS AND THE TRAINING OF FARMERS CONVOKES LAWYERS
PRESIDES OVER NOTARIES HARANGUES SCRIVENERS VISITS LIMBS OF THE LAW
FOLLOWS LAWSUITS DRAWS UP LEASES DICTATES CONTRACTS FEELS HERSELF THE
SOVEREIGN SELLS BUYS REGULATES PROMISES AND COMPROMISES BINDS FAST
AND ANNULS YIELDS CONCEDES AND RETROCEDES ARRANGES DISARRANGES
HOARDS LAVISHES SHE COMMITS FOLLIES A SUPREME AND PERSONAL DELIGHT
AND THAT CONSOLES HER
WHILE HER HUSBAND DISDAINS HER SHE HAS THE
SATISFACTION OF RUINING HER HUSBAND THIS THEORY M
GILLENORMAND HAD
HIMSELF APPLIED AND IT HAD BECOME HIS HISTORY
HIS WIFE THE SECOND
ONE HAD ADMINISTERED HIS FORTUNE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE FINE DAY
WHEN M
GILLENORMAND FOUND HIMSELF A WIDOWER THERE REMAINED TO HIM JUST
SUFFICIENT TO LIVE ON BY SINKING NEARLY THE WHOLE OF IT IN AN ANNUITY
OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS THREE QUARTERS OF WHICH WOULD EXPIRE WITH
HIM
HE HAD NOT HESITATED ON THIS POINT NOT BEING ANXIOUS TO LEAVE
A PROPERTY BEHIND HIM
BESIDES HE HAD NOTICED THAT PATRIMONIES ARE
SUBJECT TO ADVENTURES AND FOR INSTANCE BECOME NATIONAL PROPERTY HE
HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE AVATARS OF CONSOLIDATED THREE PER CENTS AND HE
HAD NO GREAT FAITH IN THE GREAT BOOK OF THE PUBLIC DEBT
ALL THAT'S
THE RUE QUINCAMPOIS HE SAID
HIS HOUSE IN THE RUE FILLES DU CLAVAIRE
BELONGED TO HIM AS WE HAVE ALREADY STATED
HE HAD TWO SERVANTS A MALE
AND A FEMALE WHEN A SERVANT ENTERED HIS ESTABLISHMENT M
GILLENORMAND
RE BAPTIZED HIM
HE BESTOWED ON THE MEN THE NAME OF THEIR PROVINCE
NIMOIS COMTOIS POITEVIN PICARD
HIS LAST VALET WAS A BIG FOUNDERED
SHORT WINDED FELLOW OF FIFTY FIVE WHO WAS INCAPABLE OF RUNNING TWENTY
PACES BUT AS HE HAD BEEN BORN AT BAYONNE M
GILLENORMAND CALLED HIM
BASQUE
ALL THE FEMALE SERVANTS IN HIS HOUSE WERE CALLED NICOLETTE EVEN
THE MAGNON OF WHOM WE SHALL HEAR MORE FARTHER ON
ONE DAY A HAUGHTY
COOK A CORDON BLEU OF THE LOFTY RACE OF PORTERS PRESENTED HERSELF
HOW MUCH WAGES DO YOU WANT A MONTH ASKED M
GILLENORMAND
THIRTY
FRANCS WHAT IS YOUR NAME OLYMPIE YOU SHALL HAVE FIFTY FRANCS
AND YOU SHALL BE CALLED NICOLETTE
CHAPTER VI IN WHICH MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARE SEEN
WITH M
GILLENORMAND SORROW WAS CONVERTED INTO WRATH HE WAS FURIOUS AT
BEING IN DESPAIR
HE HAD ALL SORTS OF PREJUDICES AND TOOK ALL SORTS
OF LIBERTIES
ONE OF THE FACTS OF WHICH HIS EXTERIOR RELIEF AND HIS
INTERNAL SATISFACTION WAS COMPOSED WAS AS WE HAVE JUST HINTED THAT HE
HAD REMAINED A BRISK SPARK AND THAT HE PASSED ENERGETICALLY FOR SUCH
THIS HE CALLED HAVING ROYAL RENOWN THIS ROYAL RENOWN SOMETIMES DREW
DOWN UPON HIM SINGULAR WINDFALLS
ONE DAY THERE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM IN
A BASKET AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A BASKET OF OYSTERS A STOUT NEWLY
BORN BOY WHO WAS YELLING LIKE THE DEUCE AND DULY WRAPPED IN
SWADDLING CLOTHES WHICH A SERVANT MAID DISMISSED SIX MONTHS
PREVIOUSLY ATTRIBUTED TO HIM
M
GILLENORMAND HAD AT THAT TIME
FULLY COMPLETED HIS EIGHTY FOURTH YEAR
INDIGNATION AND UPROAR IN THE
ESTABLISHMENT
AND WHOM DID THAT BOLD HUSSY THINK SHE COULD PERSUADE TO
BELIEVE THAT WHAT AUDACITY WHAT AN ABOMINABLE CALUMNY M
GILLENORMAND
HIMSELF WAS NOT AT ALL ENRAGED
HE GAZED AT THE BRAT WITH THE AMIABLE
SMILE OF A GOOD MAN WHO IS FLATTERED BY THE CALUMNY AND SAID IN AN
ASIDE WELL WHAT NOW WHAT'S THE MATTER YOU ARE FINELY TAKEN ABACK
AND REALLY YOU ARE EXCESSIVELY IGNORANT
M
LE DUC D'ANGOULEME THE
BASTARD OF HIS MAJESTY CHARLES IX MARRIED A SILLY JADE OF FIFTEEN
WHEN HE WAS EIGHTY FIVE M
VIRGINAL MARQUIS D'ALLUYE BROTHER TO
THE CARDINAL DE SOURDIS ARCHBISHOP OF BORDEAUX HAD AT THE AGE OF
EIGHTY THREE BY THE MAID OF MADAME LA PRESIDENTE JACQUIN A SON A
REAL CHILD OF LOVE WHO BECAME A CHEVALIER OF MALTA AND A COUNSELLOR OF
STATE ONE OF THE GREAT MEN OF THIS CENTURY THE ABBE TABARAUD IS THE
SON OF A MAN OF EIGHTY SEVEN
THERE IS NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY IN
THESE THINGS
AND THEN THE BIBLE UPON THAT I DECLARE THAT THIS LITTLE
GENTLEMAN IS NONE OF MINE
LET HIM BE TAKEN CARE OF
IT IS NOT HIS
FAULT THIS MANNER OF PROCEDURE WAS GOOD TEMPERED
THE WOMAN WHOSE
NAME WAS MAGNON SENT HIM ANOTHER PARCEL IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR
IT WAS A
BOY AGAIN
THEREUPON M
GILLENORMAND CAPITULATED
HE SENT THE TWO BRATS
BACK TO THEIR MOTHER PROMISING TO PAY EIGHTY FRANCS A MONTH FOR THEIR
MAINTENANCE ON THE CONDITION THAT THE SAID MOTHER WOULD NOT DO SO ANY
MORE
HE ADDED I INSIST UPON IT THAT THE MOTHER SHALL TREAT THEM WELL
I SHALL GO TO SEE THEM FROM TIME TO TIME AND THIS HE DID
HE HAD HAD
A BROTHER WHO WAS A PRIEST AND WHO HAD BEEN RECTOR OF THE ACADEMY OF
POITIERS FOR THREE AND THIRTY YEARS AND HAD DIED AT SEVENTY NINE
I LOST HIM YOUNG SAID HE
THIS BROTHER OF WHOM BUT LITTLE MEMORY
REMAINS WAS A PEACEABLE MISER WHO BEING A PRIEST THOUGHT HIMSELF
BOUND TO BESTOW ALMS ON THE POOR WHOM HE MET BUT HE NEVER GAVE THEM
ANYTHING EXCEPT BAD OR DEMONETIZED SOUS THEREBY DISCOVERING A MEANS OF
GOING TO HELL BY WAY OF PARADISE
AS FOR M
GILLENORMAND THE ELDER HE
NEVER HAGGLED OVER HIS ALMS GIVING BUT GAVE GLADLY AND NOBLY
HE WAS
KINDLY ABRUPT CHARITABLE AND IF HE HAD BEEN RICH HIS TURN OF MIND
WOULD HAVE BEEN MAGNIFICENT
HE DESIRED THAT ALL WHICH CONCERNED HIM
SHOULD BE DONE IN A GRAND MANNER EVEN HIS ROGUERIES
ONE DAY HAVING
BEEN CHEATED BY A BUSINESS MAN IN A MATTER OF INHERITANCE IN A GROSS
AND APPARENT MANNER HE UTTERED THIS SOLEMN EXCLAMATION THAT WAS
INDECENTLY DONE I AM REALLY ASHAMED OF THIS PILFERING
EVERYTHING HAS
DEGENERATED IN THIS CENTURY EVEN THE RASCALS
MORBLEU THIS IS NOT THE
WAY TO ROB A MAN OF MY STANDING
I AM ROBBED AS THOUGH IN A FOREST BUT
BADLY ROBBED
SILVA SINT CONSULE DIGNAE HE HAD HAD TWO WIVES AS
WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED BY THE FIRST HE HAD HAD A DAUGHTER WHO HAD
REMAINED UNMARRIED AND BY THE SECOND ANOTHER DAUGHTER WHO HAD DIED
AT ABOUT THE AGE OF THIRTY WHO HAD WEDDED THROUGH LOVE OR CHANCE
OR OTHERWISE A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE WHO HAD SERVED IN THE ARMIES OF THE
REPUBLIC AND OF THE EMPIRE WHO HAD WON THE CROSS AT AUSTERLITZ AND HAD
BEEN MADE COLONEL AT WATERLOO
HE IS THE DISGRACE OF MY FAMILY
SAID THE OLD BOURGEOIS
HE TOOK AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF SNUFF AND HAD A
PARTICULARLY GRACEFUL MANNER OF PLUCKING AT HIS LACE RUFFLE WITH THE
BACK OF ONE HAND
HE BELIEVED VERY LITTLE IN GOD
CHAPTER VII RULE RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENING
SUCH WAS M
LUC ESPRIT GILLENORMAND WHO HAD NOT LOST HIS HAIR WHICH
WAS GRAY RATHER THAN WHITE AND WHICH WAS ALWAYS DRESSED IN DOG'S
EARS TO SUM UP HE WAS VENERABLE IN SPITE OF ALL THIS
HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ABOUT HIM FRIVOLOUS AND
GREAT
IN 1814 AND DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THE RESTORATION M
GILLENORMAND
WHO WAS STILL YOUNG HE WAS ONLY SEVENTY FOUR LIVED IN THE FAUBOURG
SAINT GERMAIN RUE SERVANDONI NEAR SAINT SULPICE
HE HAD ONLY RETIRED
TO THE MARAIS WHEN HE QUITTED SOCIETY LONG AFTER ATTAINING THE AGE OF
EIGHTY
AND ON ABANDONING SOCIETY HE HAD IMMURED HIMSELF IN HIS HABITS
THE
PRINCIPAL ONE AND THAT WHICH WAS INVARIABLE WAS TO KEEP HIS DOOR
ABSOLUTELY CLOSED DURING THE DAY AND NEVER TO RECEIVE ANY ONE WHATEVER
EXCEPT IN THE EVENING
HE DINED AT FIVE O'CLOCK AND AFTER THAT HIS DOOR
WAS OPEN
THAT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS CENTURY AND HE WOULD NOT
SWERVE FROM IT
THE DAY IS VULGAR SAID HE AND DESERVES ONLY A
CLOSED SHUTTER
FASHIONABLE PEOPLE ONLY LIGHT UP THEIR MINDS WHEN THE
ZENITH LIGHTS UP ITS STARS AND HE BARRICADED HIMSELF AGAINST EVERY
ONE EVEN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF
THIS WAS THE ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE
OF HIS DAY
CHAPTER VIII TWO DO NOT MAKE A PAIR
WE HAVE JUST SPOKEN OF M
GILLENORMAND'S TWO DAUGHTERS
THEY HAD COME
INTO THE WORLD TEN YEARS APART
IN THEIR YOUTH THEY HAD BORNE VERY
LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO EACH OTHER EITHER IN CHARACTER OR COUNTENANCE
AND HAD ALSO BEEN AS LITTLE LIKE SISTERS TO EACH OTHER AS POSSIBLE
THE
YOUNGEST HAD A CHARMING SOUL WHICH TURNED TOWARDS ALL THAT BELONGS TO
THE LIGHT WAS OCCUPIED WITH FLOWERS WITH VERSES WITH MUSIC WHICH
FLUTTERED AWAY INTO GLORIOUS SPACE ENTHUSIASTIC ETHEREAL AND WAS
WEDDED FROM HER VERY YOUTH IN IDEAL TO A VAGUE AND HEROIC FIGURE
THE
ELDER HAD ALSO HER CHIMERA SHE ESPIED IN THE AZURE SOME VERY WEALTHY
PURVEYOR A CONTRACTOR A SPLENDIDLY STUPID HUSBAND A MILLION MADE MAN
OR EVEN A PREFECT THE RECEPTIONS OF THE PREFECTURE AN USHER IN THE
ANTECHAMBER WITH A CHAIN ON HIS NECK OFFICIAL BALLS THE HARANGUES
OF THE TOWN HALL TO BE MADAME LA PREFETE ALL THIS HAD CREATED A
WHIRLWIND IN HER IMAGINATION
THUS THE TWO SISTERS STRAYED EACH IN HER
OWN DREAM AT THE EPOCH WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG GIRLS
BOTH HAD WINGS THE
ONE LIKE AN ANGEL THE OTHER LIKE A GOOSE
NO AMBITION IS EVER FULLY REALIZED HERE BELOW AT LEAST
NO PARADISE
BECOMES TERRESTRIAL IN OUR DAY
THE YOUNGER WEDDED THE MAN OF HER
DREAMS BUT SHE DIED
THE ELDER DID NOT MARRY AT ALL
AT THE MOMENT WHEN SHE MAKES HER ENTRANCE INTO THIS HISTORY WHICH WE ARE
RELATING SHE WAS AN ANTIQUE VIRTUE AN INCOMBUSTIBLE PRUDE WITH ONE OF
THE SHARPEST NOSES AND ONE OF THE MOST OBTUSE MINDS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE
TO SEE
A CHARACTERISTIC DETAIL OUTSIDE OF HER IMMEDIATE FAMILY NO ONE
HAD EVER KNOWN HER FIRST NAME
SHE WAS CALLED MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND
THE ELDER
IN THE MATTER OF CANT MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND COULD HAVE GIVEN POINTS
TO A MISS
HER MODESTY WAS CARRIED TO THE OTHER EXTREME OF BLACKNESS
SHE CHERISHED A FRIGHTFUL MEMORY OF HER LIFE ONE DAY A MAN HAD BEHELD
HER GARTER
AGE HAD ONLY SERVED TO ACCENTUATE THIS PITILESS MODESTY
HER GUIMPE WAS
NEVER SUFFICIENTLY OPAQUE AND NEVER ASCENDED SUFFICIENTLY HIGH
SHE
MULTIPLIED CLASPS AND PINS WHERE NO ONE WOULD HAVE DREAMED OF LOOKING
THE PECULIARITY OF PRUDERY IS TO PLACE ALL THE MORE SENTINELS IN
PROPORTION AS THE FORTRESS IS THE LESS MENACED
NEVERTHELESS LET HIM WHO CAN EXPLAIN THESE ANTIQUE MYSTERIES OF
INNOCENCE SHE ALLOWED AN OFFICER OF THE LANCERS HER GRAND NEPHEW
NAMED THEODULE TO EMBRACE HER WITHOUT DISPLEASURE
IN SPITE OF THIS FAVORED LANCER THE LABEL PRUDE UNDER WHICH WE
HAVE CLASSED HER SUITED HER TO ABSOLUTE PERFECTION
MADEMOISELLE
GILLENORMAND WAS A SORT OF TWILIGHT SOUL
PRUDERY IS A DEMI VIRTUE AND A
DEMI VICE
TO PRUDERY SHE ADDED BIGOTRY A WELL ASSORTED LINING
SHE BELONGED
TO THE SOCIETY OF THE VIRGIN WORE A WHITE VEIL ON CERTAIN FESTIVALS
MUMBLED SPECIAL ORISONS REVERED THE HOLY BLOOD VENERATED THE SACRED
HEART REMAINED FOR HOURS IN CONTEMPLATION BEFORE A ROCOCO JESUIT ALTAR
IN A CHAPEL WHICH WAS INACCESSIBLE TO THE RANK AND FILE OF THE FAITHFUL
AND THERE ALLOWED HER SOUL TO SOAR AMONG LITTLE CLOUDS OF MARBLE AND
THROUGH GREAT RAYS OF GILDED WOOD
SHE HAD A CHAPEL FRIEND AN ANCIENT VIRGIN LIKE HERSELF NAMED
MADEMOISELLE VAUBOIS WHO WAS A POSITIVE BLOCKHEAD AND BESIDE WHOM
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING AN EAGLE
BEYOND
THE AGNUS DEI AND AVE MARIA MADEMOISELLE VAUBOIS HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF
ANYTHING EXCEPT OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MAKING PRESERVES
MADEMOISELLE
VAUBOIS PERFECT IN HER STYLE WAS THE ERMINE OF STUPIDITY WITHOUT A
SINGLE SPOT OF INTELLIGENCE
LET US SAY IT PLAINLY MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND HAD GAINED RATHER THAN
LOST AS SHE GREW OLDER
THIS IS THE CASE WITH PASSIVE NATURES
SHE HAD
NEVER BEEN MALICIOUS WHICH IS RELATIVE KINDNESS AND THEN YEARS WEAR
AWAY THE ANGLES AND THE SOFTENING WHICH COMES WITH TIME HAD COME TO
HER
SHE WAS MELANCHOLY WITH AN OBSCURE SADNESS OF WHICH SHE DID NOT
HERSELF KNOW THE SECRET
THERE BREATHED FROM HER WHOLE PERSON THE STUPOR
OF A LIFE THAT WAS FINISHED AND WHICH HAD NEVER HAD A BEGINNING
SHE KEPT HOUSE FOR HER FATHER
M
GILLENORMAND HAD HIS DAUGHTER NEAR
HIM AS WE HAVE SEEN THAT MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU HAD HIS SISTER WITH HIM
THESE HOUSEHOLDS COMPRISED OF AN OLD MAN AND AN OLD SPINSTER ARE NOT
RARE AND ALWAYS HAVE THE TOUCHING ASPECT OF TWO WEAKNESSES LEANING ON
EACH OTHER FOR SUPPORT
THERE WAS ALSO IN THIS HOUSE BETWEEN THIS ELDERLY SPINSTER AND THIS
OLD MAN A CHILD A LITTLE BOY WHO WAS ALWAYS TREMBLING AND MUTE IN THE
PRESENCE OF M
GILLENORMAND
M
GILLENORMAND NEVER ADDRESSED THIS CHILD
EXCEPT IN A SEVERE VOICE AND SOMETIMES WITH UPLIFTED CANE HERE SIR
RASCAL SCOUNDREL COME HERE ANSWER ME YOU SCAMP JUST LET ME SEE
YOU YOU GOOD FOR NOTHING ETC ETC
HE IDOLIZED HIM
THIS WAS HIS GRANDSON
WE SHALL MEET WITH THIS CHILD AGAIN LATER ON
BOOK THIRD THE GRANDFATHER AND THE GRANDSON
CHAPTER I AN ANCIENT SALON
WHEN M
GILLENORMAND LIVED IN THE RUE SERVANDONI HE HAD FREQUENTED
MANY VERY GOOD AND VERY ARISTOCRATIC SALONS
ALTHOUGH A BOURGEOIS M
GILLENORMAND WAS RECEIVED IN SOCIETY
AS HE HAD A DOUBLE MEASURE OF WIT
IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WHICH WAS BORN WITH HIM AND SECONDLY THAT
WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTED TO HIM HE WAS EVEN SOUGHT OUT AND MADE MUCH OF
HE
NEVER WENT ANYWHERE EXCEPT ON CONDITION OF BEING THE CHIEF PERSON THERE
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE INFLUENCE AT ANY PRICE AND WHO WILL HAVE
OTHER PEOPLE BUSY THEMSELVES OVER THEM WHEN THEY CANNOT BE ORACLES
THEY TURN WAGS
M
GILLENORMAND WAS NOT OF THIS NATURE HIS DOMINATION
IN THE ROYALIST SALONS WHICH HE FREQUENTED COST HIS SELF RESPECT
NOTHING
HE WAS AN ORACLE EVERYWHERE
IT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM TO HOLD HIS
OWN AGAINST M
DE BONALD AND EVEN AGAINST M
BENGY PUY VALLEE
ABOUT 1817 HE INVARIABLY PASSED TWO AFTERNOONS A WEEK IN A HOUSE IN
HIS OWN NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE RUE FEROU WITH MADAME LA BARONNE DE T
A WORTHY AND RESPECTABLE PERSON WHOSE HUSBAND HAD BEEN AMBASSADOR OF
FRANCE TO BERLIN UNDER LOUIS XVI
BARON DE T WHO DURING HIS LIFETIME
HAD GONE VERY PASSIONATELY INTO ECSTASIES AND MAGNETIC VISIONS HAD DIED
BANKRUPT DURING THE EMIGRATION LEAVING AS HIS ENTIRE FORTUNE
SOME VERY CURIOUS MEMOIRS ABOUT MESMER AND HIS TUB IN TEN MANUSCRIPT
VOLUMES BOUND IN RED MOROCCO AND GILDED ON THE EDGES
MADAME DE T
HAD
NOT PUBLISHED THE MEMOIRS OUT OF PRIDE AND MAINTAINED HERSELF ON A
MEAGRE INCOME WHICH HAD SURVIVED NO ONE KNEW HOW
MADAME DE T
LIVED FAR FROM THE COURT A VERY MIXED SOCIETY AS SHE
SAID IN A NOBLE ISOLATION PROUD AND POOR
A FEW FRIENDS ASSEMBLED
TWICE A WEEK ABOUT HER WIDOWED HEARTH AND THESE CONSTITUTED A PURELY
ROYALIST SALON
THEY SIPPED TEA THERE AND UTTERED GROANS OR CRIES OF
HORROR AT THE CENTURY THE CHARTER THE BONAPARTISTS THE PROSTITUTION
OF THE BLUE RIBBON OR THE JACOBINISM OF LOUIS XVIII ACCORDING AS THE
WIND VEERED TOWARDS ELEGY OR DITHYRAMBS AND THEY SPOKE IN LOW TONES OF
THE HOPES WHICH WERE PRESENTED BY MONSIEUR AFTERWARDS CHARLES X
THE SONGS OF THE FISHWOMEN IN WHICH NAPOLEON WAS CALLED NICOLAS WERE
RECEIVED THERE WITH TRANSPORTS OF JOY
DUCHESSES THE MOST DELICATE AND
CHARMING WOMEN IN THE WORLD WENT INTO ECSTASIES OVER COUPLETS LIKE THE
FOLLOWING ADDRESSED TO THE FEDERATES
REFONCEZ DANS VOS CULOTTES 20
LE BOUT D' CHEMIS' QUI VOUS PEND
QU'ON N' DIS' PAS QU' LES PATRIOTES
ONT ARBORE L' DRAPEAU BLANC
THERE THEY AMUSED THEMSELVES WITH PUNS WHICH WERE CONSIDERED TERRIBLE
WITH INNOCENT PLAYS UPON WORDS WHICH THEY SUPPOSED TO BE VENOMOUS WITH
QUATRAINS WITH DISTICHES EVEN THUS UPON THE DESSOLLES MINISTRY A
MODERATE CABINET OF WHICH MM
DECAZES AND DESERRE WERE MEMBERS
POUR RAFFERMIR LE TRONE EBRANLE SUR SA BASE 21
IL FAUT CHANGER DE SOL ET DE SERRE ET DE CASE
OR THEY DREW UP A LIST OF THE CHAMBER OF PEERS AN ABOMINABLY JACOBIN
CHAMBER AND FROM THIS LIST THEY COMBINED ALLIANCES OF NAMES IN SUCH
A MANNER AS TO FORM FOR EXAMPLE PHRASES LIKE THE FOLLOWING DAMAS
SABRAN
GOUVION SAINT CYR ALL THIS WAS DONE MERRILY
IN THAT SOCIETY
THEY PARODIED THE REVOLUTION
THEY USED I KNOW NOT WHAT DESIRES TO GIVE
POINT TO THE SAME WRATH IN INVERSE SENSE
THEY SANG THEIR LITTLE CA
IRA
AH CA IRA CA IRA CA IRA
LES BONAPARTISTES A LA LANTERNE
SONGS ARE LIKE THE GUILLOTINE THEY CHOP AWAY INDIFFERENTLY TO DAY THIS
HEAD TO MORROW THAT
IT IS ONLY A VARIATION
IN THE FUALDES AFFAIR WHICH BELONGS TO THIS EPOCH 1816 THEY TOOK
PART FOR BASTIDE AND JAUSION BECAUSE FUALDES WAS A BUONAPARTIST THEY
DESIGNATED THE LIBERALS AS FRIENDS AND BROTHERS THIS CONSTITUTED THE
MOST DEADLY INSULT
LIKE CERTAIN CHURCH TOWERS MADAME DE T 'S SALON HAD TWO COCKS
ONE OF
THEM WAS M
GILLENORMAND THE OTHER WAS COMTE DE LAMOTHE VALOIS OF WHOM
IT WAS WHISPERED ABOUT WITH A SORT OF RESPECT DO YOU KNOW THAT IS
THE LAMOTHE OF THE AFFAIR OF THE NECKLACE THESE SINGULAR AMNESTIES DO
OCCUR IN PARTIES
LET US ADD THE FOLLOWING IN THE BOURGEOISIE HONORED SITUATIONS DECAY
THROUGH TOO EASY RELATIONS ONE MUST BEWARE WHOM ONE ADMITS IN THE SAME
WAY THAT THERE IS A LOSS OF CALORIC IN THE VICINITY OF THOSE WHO ARE
COLD THERE IS A DIMINUTION OF CONSIDERATION IN THE APPROACH OF DESPISED
PERSONS
THE ANCIENT SOCIETY OF THE UPPER CLASSES HELD THEMSELVES ABOVE
THIS LAW AS ABOVE EVERY OTHER
MARIGNY THE BROTHER OF THE POMPADOUR
HAD HIS ENTRY WITH M
LE PRINCE DE SOUBISE
IN SPITE OF NO BECAUSE
DU
BARRY THE GOD FATHER OF THE VAUBERNIER WAS VERY WELCOME AT THE HOUSE
OF M
LE MARECHAL DE RICHELIEU
THIS SOCIETY IS OLYMPUS
MERCURY AND
THE PRINCE DE GUEMENEE ARE AT HOME THERE
A THIEF IS ADMITTED THERE
PROVIDED HE BE A GOD
THE COMTE DE LAMOTHE WHO IN 1815 WAS AN OLD MAN SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OF
AGE HAD NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT HIM EXCEPT HIS SILENT AND SENTENTIOUS
AIR HIS COLD AND ANGULAR FACE HIS PERFECTLY POLISHED MANNERS HIS COAT
BUTTONED UP TO HIS CRAVAT AND HIS LONG LEGS ALWAYS CROSSED IN LONG
FLABBY TROUSERS OF THE HUE OF BURNT SIENNA
HIS FACE WAS THE SAME COLOR
AS HIS TROUSERS
THIS M
DE LAMOTHE WAS HELD IN CONSIDERATION IN THIS SALON ON ACCOUNT
OF HIS CELEBRITY AND STRANGE TO SAY THOUGH TRUE BECAUSE OF HIS NAME
OF VALOIS
AS FOR M
GILLENORMAND HIS CONSIDERATION WAS OF ABSOLUTELY FIRST RATE
QUALITY
HE HAD IN SPITE OF HIS LEVITY AND WITHOUT ITS INTERFERING IN
ANY WAY WITH HIS DIGNITY A CERTAIN MANNER ABOUT HIM WHICH WAS IMPOSING
DIGNIFIED HONEST AND LOFTY IN A BOURGEOIS FASHION AND HIS GREAT
AGE ADDED TO IT
ONE IS NOT A CENTURY WITH IMPUNITY
THE YEARS FINALLY
PRODUCE AROUND A HEAD A VENERABLE DISHEVELMENT
IN ADDITION TO THIS HE SAID THINGS WHICH HAD THE GENUINE SPARKLE OF THE
OLD ROCK
THUS WHEN THE KING OF PRUSSIA AFTER HAVING RESTORED LOUIS
XVIII CAME TO PAY THE LATTER A VISIT UNDER THE NAME OF THE COUNT DE
RUPPIN HE WAS RECEIVED BY THE DESCENDANT OF LOUIS XIV
SOMEWHAT
AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN THE MARQUIS DE BRANDEBOURG AND WITH THE MOST
DELICATE IMPERTINENCE
M
GILLENORMAND APPROVED ALL KINGS WHO ARE
NOT THE KING OF FRANCE SAID HE ARE PROVINCIAL KINGS ONE DAY THE
FOLLOWING QUESTION WAS PUT AND THE FOLLOWING ANSWER RETURNED IN HIS
PRESENCE TO WHAT WAS THE EDITOR OF THE COURRIER FRANCAIS CONDEMNED
TO BE SUSPENDED SUS IS SUPERFLUOUS OBSERVED M
GILLENORMAND 22
REMARKS OF THIS NATURE FOUND A SITUATION
AT THE TE DEUM ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE RETURN OF THE BOURBONS HE
SAID ON SEEING M
DE TALLEYRAND PASS BY THERE GOES HIS EXCELLENCY THE
EVIL ONE
M
GILLENORMAND WAS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS DAUGHTER THAT TALL
MADEMOISELLE WHO WAS OVER FORTY AND LOOKED FIFTY AND BY A HANDSOME
LITTLE BOY OF SEVEN YEARS WHITE ROSY FRESH WITH HAPPY AND TRUSTING
EYES WHO NEVER APPEARED IN THAT SALON WITHOUT HEARING VOICES MURMUR
AROUND HIM HOW HANDSOME HE IS WHAT A PITY POOR CHILD THIS CHILD
WAS THE ONE OF WHOM WE DROPPED A WORD A WHILE AGO
HE WAS CALLED POOR
CHILD BECAUSE HE HAD FOR A FATHER A BRIGAND OF THE LOIRE
THIS BRIGAND OF THE LOIRE WAS M
GILLENORMAND'S SON IN LAW WHO HAS
ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED AND WHOM M
GILLENORMAND CALLED THE DISGRACE OF
HIS FAMILY
CHAPTER II ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH
ANY ONE WHO HAD CHANCED TO PASS THROUGH THE LITTLE TOWN OF VERNON AT
THIS EPOCH AND WHO HAD HAPPENED TO WALK ACROSS THAT FINE MONUMENTAL
BRIDGE WHICH WILL SOON BE SUCCEEDED LET US HOPE BY SOME HIDEOUS IRON
CABLE BRIDGE MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED HAD HE DROPPED HIS EYES OVER THE
PARAPET A MAN ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE WEARING A LEATHER CAP AND
TROUSERS AND A WAISTCOAT OF COARSE GRAY CLOTH TO WHICH SOMETHING YELLOW
WHICH HAD BEEN A RED RIBBON WAS SEWN SHOD WITH WOODEN SABOTS TANNED
BY THE SUN HIS FACE NEARLY BLACK AND HIS HAIR NEARLY WHITE A LARGE
SCAR ON HIS FOREHEAD WHICH RAN DOWN UPON HIS CHEEK BOWED BENT
PREMATURELY AGED WHO WALKED NEARLY EVERY DAY HOE AND SICKLE IN HAND
IN ONE OF THOSE COMPARTMENTS SURROUNDED BY WALLS WHICH ABUT ON THE
BRIDGE AND BORDER THE LEFT BANK OF THE SEINE LIKE A CHAIN OF TERRACES
CHARMING ENCLOSURES FULL OF FLOWERS OF WHICH ONE COULD SAY WERE THEY
MUCH LARGER THESE ARE GARDENS AND WERE THEY A LITTLE SMALLER THESE
ARE BOUQUETS ALL THESE ENCLOSURES ABUT UPON THE RIVER AT ONE END AND
ON A HOUSE AT THE OTHER
THE MAN IN THE WAISTCOAT AND THE WOODEN SHOES
OF WHOM WE HAVE JUST SPOKEN INHABITED THE SMALLEST OF THESE ENCLOSURES
AND THE MOST HUMBLE OF THESE HOUSES ABOUT 1817
HE LIVED THERE ALONE AND
SOLITARY SILENTLY AND POORLY WITH A WOMAN WHO WAS NEITHER YOUNG NOR
OLD NEITHER HOMELY NOR PRETTY NEITHER A PEASANT NOR A BOURGEOISE WHO
SERVED HIM
THE PLOT OF EARTH WHICH HE CALLED HIS GARDEN WAS CELEBRATED
IN THE TOWN FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE FLOWERS WHICH HE CULTIVATED THERE
THESE FLOWERS WERE HIS OCCUPATION
BY DINT OF LABOR OF PERSEVERANCE OF ATTENTION AND OF BUCKETS OF
WATER HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN CREATING AFTER THE CREATOR AND HE HAD
INVENTED CERTAIN TULIPS AND CERTAIN DAHLIAS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN
FORGOTTEN BY NATURE
HE WAS INGENIOUS HE HAD FORESTALLED SOULANGE
BODIN IN THE FORMATION OF LITTLE CLUMPS OF EARTH OF HEATH MOULD FOR THE
CULTIVATION OF RARE AND PRECIOUS SHRUBS FROM AMERICA AND CHINA
HE
WAS IN HIS ALLEYS FROM THE BREAK OF DAY IN SUMMER PLANTING CUTTING
HOEING WATERING WALKING AMID HIS FLOWERS WITH AN AIR OF KINDNESS
SADNESS AND SWEETNESS SOMETIMES STANDING MOTIONLESS AND THOUGHTFUL
FOR HOURS LISTENING TO THE SONG OF A BIRD IN THE TREES THE BABBLE OF A
CHILD IN A HOUSE OR WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON A DROP OF DEW AT THE TIP OF
A SPEAR OF GRASS OF WHICH THE SUN MADE A CARBUNCLE
HIS TABLE WAS VERY
PLAIN AND HE DRANK MORE MILK THAN WINE
A CHILD COULD MAKE HIM GIVE
WAY AND HIS SERVANT SCOLDED HIM
HE WAS SO TIMID THAT HE SEEMED SHY HE
RARELY WENT OUT AND HE SAW NO ONE BUT THE POOR PEOPLE WHO TAPPED AT HIS
PANE AND HIS CURE THE ABBE MABEUF A GOOD OLD MAN
NEVERTHELESS IF THE
INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN OR STRANGERS OR ANY CHANCE COMERS CURIOUS TO
SEE HIS TULIPS RANG AT HIS LITTLE COTTAGE HE OPENED HIS DOOR WITH A
SMILE
HE WAS THE BRIGAND OF THE LOIRE
ANY ONE WHO HAD AT THE SAME TIME READ MILITARY MEMOIRS BIOGRAPHIES
THE MONITEUR AND THE BULLETINS OF THE GRAND ARMY WOULD HAVE BEEN
STRUCK BY A NAME WHICH OCCURS THERE WITH TOLERABLE FREQUENCY THE NAME
OF GEORGES PONTMERCY
WHEN VERY YOUNG THIS GEORGES PONTMERCY HAD BEEN
A SOLDIER IN SAINTONGE'S REGIMENT
THE REVOLUTION BROKE OUT
SAINTONGE'S
REGIMENT FORMED A PART OF THE ARMY OF THE RHINE FOR THE OLD REGIMENTS
OF THE MONARCHY PRESERVED THEIR NAMES OF PROVINCES EVEN AFTER THE FALL
OF THE MONARCHY AND WERE ONLY DIVIDED INTO BRIGADES IN 1794
PONTMERCY
FOUGHT AT SPIRE AT WORMS AT NEUSTADT AT TURKHEIM AT ALZEY AT
MAYENCE WHERE HE WAS ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED WHO FORMED HOUCHARD'S
REARGUARD
IT WAS THE TWELFTH TO HOLD ITS GROUND AGAINST THE CORPS
OF THE PRINCE OF HESSE BEHIND THE OLD RAMPART OF ANDERNACH AND ONLY
REJOINED THE MAIN BODY OF THE ARMY WHEN THE ENEMY'S CANNON HAD OPENED
A BREACH FROM THE CORD OF THE PARAPET TO THE FOOT OF THE GLACIS
HE WAS
UNDER KLEBER AT MARCHIENNES AND AT THE BATTLE OF MONT PALISSEL WHERE
A BALL FROM A BISCAIEN BROKE HIS ARM
THEN HE PASSED TO THE FRONTIER
OF ITALY AND WAS ONE OF THE THIRTY GRENADIERS WHO DEFENDED THE COL
DE TENDE WITH JOUBERT
JOUBERT WAS APPOINTED ITS ADJUTANT GENERAL AND
PONTMERCY SUB LIEUTENANT
PONTMERCY WAS BY BERTHIER'S SIDE IN THE MIDST
OF THE GRAPE SHOT OF THAT DAY AT LODI WHICH CAUSED BONAPARTE TO SAY
BERTHIER HAS BEEN CANNONEER CAVALIER AND GRENADIER HE BEHELD HIS
OLD GENERAL JOUBERT FALL AT NOVI AT THE MOMENT WHEN WITH UPLIFTED
SABRE HE WAS SHOUTING FORWARD HAVING BEEN EMBARKED WITH HIS
COMPANY IN THE EXIGENCIES OF THE CAMPAIGN ON BOARD A PINNACE WHICH WAS
PROCEEDING FROM GENOA TO SOME OBSCURE PORT ON THE COAST HE FELL INTO
A WASPS' NEST OF SEVEN OR EIGHT ENGLISH VESSELS
THE GENOESE COMMANDER
WANTED TO THROW HIS CANNON INTO THE SEA TO HIDE THE SOLDIERS BETWEEN
DECKS AND TO SLIP ALONG IN THE DARK AS A MERCHANT VESSEL
PONTMERCY HAD
THE COLORS HOISTED TO THE PEAK AND SAILED PROUDLY PAST UNDER THE GUNS
OF THE BRITISH FRIGATES
TWENTY LEAGUES FURTHER ON HIS AUDACITY HAVING
INCREASED HE ATTACKED WITH HIS PINNACE AND CAPTURED A LARGE ENGLISH
TRANSPORT WHICH WAS CARRYING TROOPS TO SICILY AND WHICH WAS SO LOADED
DOWN WITH MEN AND HORSES THAT THE VESSEL WAS SUNK TO THE LEVEL OF THE
SEA
IN 1805 HE WAS IN THAT MALHER DIVISION WHICH TOOK GUNZBERG FROM THE
ARCHDUKE FERDINAND
AT WELTINGEN HE RECEIVED INTO HIS ARMS BENEATH A
STORM OF BULLETS COLONEL MAUPETIT MORTALLY WOUNDED AT THE HEAD OF THE
9TH DRAGOONS
HE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AT AUSTERLITZ IN THAT ADMIRABLE
MARCH IN ECHELONS EFFECTED UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
WHEN THE CAVALRY OF
THE IMPERIAL RUSSIAN GUARD CRUSHED A BATTALION OF THE 4TH OF THE LINE
PONTMERCY WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO TOOK THEIR REVENGE AND OVERTHREW THE
GUARD
THE EMPEROR GAVE HIM THE CROSS
PONTMERCY SAW WURMSER AT MANTUA
MELAS AND ALEXANDRIA MACK AT ULM MADE PRISONERS IN SUCCESSION
HE FORMED A PART OF THE EIGHTH CORPS OF THE GRAND ARMY WHICH MORTIER
COMMANDED AND WHICH CAPTURED HAMBURG
THEN HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE
55TH OF THE LINE WHICH WAS THE OLD REGIMENT OF FLANDERS
AT EYLAU
HE WAS IN THE CEMETERY WHERE FOR THE SPACE OF TWO HOURS THE HEROIC
CAPTAIN LOUIS HUGO THE UNCLE OF THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK SUSTAINED
ALONE WITH HIS COMPANY OF EIGHTY THREE MEN EVERY EFFORT OF THE HOSTILE
ARMY
PONTMERCY WAS ONE OF THE THREE WHO EMERGED ALIVE FROM THAT
CEMETERY
HE WAS AT FRIEDLAND
THEN HE SAW MOSCOW
THEN LA BERESINA
THEN LUTZEN BAUTZEN DRESDEN WACHAU LEIPZIG AND THE DEFILES OF
GELENHAUSEN THEN MONTMIRAIL CHATEAU THIERRY CRAON THE BANKS OF THE
MARNE THE BANKS OF THE AISNE AND THE REDOUBTABLE POSITION OF LAON
AT
ARNAY LE DUC BEING THEN A CAPTAIN HE PUT TEN COSSACKS TO THE SWORD
AND SAVED NOT HIS GENERAL BUT HIS CORPORAL
HE WAS WELL SLASHED UP ON
THIS OCCASION AND TWENTY SEVEN SPLINTERS WERE EXTRACTED FROM HIS LEFT
ARM ALONE
EIGHT DAYS BEFORE THE CAPITULATION OF PARIS HE HAD JUST
EXCHANGED WITH A COMRADE AND ENTERED THE CAVALRY
HE HAD WHAT WAS CALLED
UNDER THE OLD REGIME THE DOUBLE HAND THAT IS TO SAY AN EQUAL APTITUDE
FOR HANDLING THE SABRE OR THE MUSKET AS A SOLDIER OR A SQUADRON OR
A BATTALION AS AN OFFICER
IT IS FROM THIS APTITUDE PERFECTED BY A
MILITARY EDUCATION WHICH CERTAIN SPECIAL BRANCHES OF THE SERVICE ARISE
THE DRAGOONS FOR EXAMPLE WHO ARE BOTH CAVALRY MEN AND INFANTRY AT ONE
AND THE SAME TIME
HE ACCOMPANIED NAPOLEON TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA
AT
WATERLOO HE WAS CHIEF OF A SQUADRON OF CUIRASSIERS IN DUBOIS' BRIGADE
IT WAS HE WHO CAPTURED THE STANDARD OF THE LUNENBURG BATTALION
HE CAME
AND CAST THE FLAG AT THE EMPEROR'S FEET
HE WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD
WHILE TEARING DOWN THE BANNER HE HAD RECEIVED A SWORD CUT ACROSS HIS
FACE
THE EMPEROR GREATLY PLEASED SHOUTED TO HIM YOU ARE A COLONEL
YOU ARE A BARON YOU ARE AN OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR PONTMERCY
REPLIED SIRE I THANK YOU FOR MY WIDOW AN HOUR LATER HE FELL IN THE
RAVINE OF OHAIN
NOW WHO WAS THIS GEORGES PONTMERCY HE WAS THIS SAME
BRIGAND OF THE LOIRE
WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN SOMETHING OF HIS HISTORY
AFTER WATERLOO
PONTMERCY WHO HAD BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE HOLLOW ROAD OF OHAIN AS IT
WILL BE REMEMBERED HAD SUCCEEDED IN JOINING THE ARMY AND HAD DRAGGED
HIMSELF FROM AMBULANCE TO AMBULANCE AS FAR AS THE CANTONMENTS OF THE
LOIRE
THE RESTORATION HAD PLACED HIM ON HALF PAY THEN HAD SENT HIM INTO
RESIDENCE THAT IS TO SAY UNDER SURVEILLANCE AT VERNON
KING LOUIS
XVIII REGARDING ALL THAT WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING THE HUNDRED
DAYS AS NOT HAVING OCCURRED AT ALL DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIS QUALITY AS AN
OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR NOR HIS GRADE OF COLONEL NOR HIS TITLE
OF BARON
HE ON HIS SIDE NEGLECTED NO OCCASION OF SIGNING HIMSELF
COLONEL BARON PONTMERCY HE HAD ONLY AN OLD BLUE COAT AND HE NEVER
WENT OUT WITHOUT FASTENING TO IT HIS ROSETTE AS AN OFFICER OF THE LEGION
OF HONOR
THE ATTORNEY FOR THE CROWN HAD HIM WARNED THAT THE AUTHORITIES
WOULD PROSECUTE HIM FOR ILLEGAL WEARING OF THIS DECORATION
WHEN THIS
NOTICE WAS CONVEYED TO HIM THROUGH AN OFFICIOUS INTERMEDIARY PONTMERCY
RETORTED WITH A BITTER SMILE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I NO LONGER
UNDERSTAND FRENCH OR WHETHER YOU NO LONGER SPEAK IT BUT THE FACT IS
THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEN HE WENT OUT FOR EIGHT SUCCESSIVE DAYS
WITH HIS ROSETTE
THEY DARED NOT INTERFERE WITH HIM
TWO OR THREE TIMES
THE MINISTER OF WAR AND THE GENERAL IN COMMAND OF THE DEPARTMENT WROTE
TO HIM WITH THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS A MONSIEUR LE COMMANDANT PONTMERCY
HE SENT BACK THE LETTERS WITH THE SEALS UNBROKEN
AT THE SAME MOMENT
NAPOLEON AT SAINT HELENA WAS TREATING IN THE SAME FASHION THE MISSIVES
OF SIR HUDSON LOWE ADDRESSED TO GENERAL BONAPARTE
PONTMERCY HAD ENDED
MAY WE BE PARDONED THE EXPRESSION BY HAVING IN HIS MOUTH THE SAME
SALIVA AS HIS EMPEROR
IN THE SAME WAY THERE WERE AT ROME CARTHAGINIAN PRISONERS WHO REFUSED
TO SALUTE FLAMINIUS AND WHO HAD A LITTLE OF HANNIBAL'S SPIRIT
ONE DAY HE ENCOUNTERED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN ONE OF THE STREETS OF
VERNON STEPPED UP TO HIM AND SAID MR
CROWN ATTORNEY AM I PERMITTED
TO WEAR MY SCAR
HE HAD NOTHING SAVE HIS MEAGRE HALF PAY AS CHIEF OF SQUADRON
HE HAD
HIRED THE SMALLEST HOUSE WHICH HE COULD FIND AT VERNON
HE LIVED THERE
ALONE WE HAVE JUST SEEN HOW
UNDER THE EMPIRE BETWEEN TWO WARS HE
HAD FOUND TIME TO MARRY MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND
THE OLD BOURGEOIS
THOROUGHLY INDIGNANT AT BOTTOM HAD GIVEN HIS CONSENT WITH A SIGH
SAYING THE GREATEST FAMILIES ARE FORCED INTO IT IN 1815 MADAME
PONTMERCY AN ADMIRABLE WOMAN IN EVERY SENSE BY THE WAY LOFTY IN
SENTIMENT AND RARE AND WORTHY OF HER HUSBAND DIED LEAVING A
CHILD
THIS CHILD HAD BEEN THE COLONEL'S JOY IN HIS SOLITUDE BUT THE
GRANDFATHER HAD IMPERATIVELY CLAIMED HIS GRANDSON DECLARING THAT IF
THE CHILD WERE NOT GIVEN TO HIM HE WOULD DISINHERIT HIM
THE FATHER HAD
YIELDED IN THE LITTLE ONE'S INTEREST AND HAD TRANSFERRED HIS LOVE TO
FLOWERS
MOREOVER HE HAD RENOUNCED EVERYTHING AND NEITHER STIRRED UP MISCHIEF
NOR CONSPIRED
HE SHARED HIS THOUGHTS BETWEEN THE INNOCENT THINGS WHICH
HE WAS THEN DOING AND THE GREAT THINGS WHICH HE HAD DONE
HE PASSED HIS
TIME IN EXPECTING A PINK OR IN RECALLING AUSTERLITZ
M
GILLENORMAND KEPT UP NO RELATIONS WITH HIS SON IN LAW
THE COLONEL
WAS A BANDIT TO HIM
M
GILLENORMAND NEVER MENTIONED THE COLONEL
EXCEPT WHEN HE OCCASIONALLY MADE MOCKING ALLUSIONS TO HIS BARONSHIP
IT HAD BEEN EXPRESSLY AGREED THAT PONTMERCY SHOULD NEVER ATTEMPT TO SEE
HIS SON NOR TO SPEAK TO HIM UNDER PENALTY OF HAVING THE LATTER HANDED
OVER TO HIM DISOWNED AND DISINHERITED
FOR THE GILLENORMANDS PONTMERCY
WAS A MAN AFFLICTED WITH THE PLAGUE
THEY INTENDED TO BRING UP THE
CHILD IN THEIR OWN WAY
PERHAPS THE COLONEL WAS WRONG TO ACCEPT THESE
CONDITIONS BUT HE SUBMITTED TO THEM THINKING THAT HE WAS DOING RIGHT
AND SACRIFICING NO ONE BUT HIMSELF
THE INHERITANCE OF FATHER GILLENORMAND DID NOT AMOUNT TO MUCH BUT THE
INHERITANCE OF MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND THE ELDER WAS CONSIDERABLE
THIS AUNT WHO HAD REMAINED UNMARRIED WAS VERY RICH ON THE MATERNAL
SIDE AND HER SISTER'S SON WAS HER NATURAL HEIR
THE BOY WHOSE NAME WAS
MARIUS KNEW THAT HE HAD A FATHER BUT NOTHING MORE
NO ONE OPENED
HIS MOUTH TO HIM ABOUT IT
NEVERTHELESS IN THE SOCIETY INTO WHICH HIS
GRANDFATHER TOOK HIM WHISPERS INNUENDOES AND WINKS HAD EVENTUALLY
ENLIGHTENED THE LITTLE BOY'S MIND HE HAD FINALLY UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING
OF THE CASE AND AS HE NATURALLY TOOK IN THE IDEAS AND OPINIONS WHICH
WERE SO TO SPEAK THE AIR HE BREATHED BY A SORT OF INFILTRATION AND
SLOW PENETRATION HE GRADUALLY CAME TO THINK OF HIS FATHER ONLY WITH
SHAME AND WITH A PAIN AT HIS HEART
WHILE HE WAS GROWING UP IN THIS FASHION THE COLONEL SLIPPED AWAY EVERY
TWO OR THREE MONTHS CAME TO PARIS ON THE SLY LIKE A CRIMINAL BREAKING
HIS BAN AND WENT AND POSTED HIMSELF AT SAINT SULPICE AT THE HOUR WHEN
AUNT GILLENORMAND LED MARIUS TO THE MASS
THERE TREMBLING LEST THE AUNT
SHOULD TURN ROUND CONCEALED BEHIND A PILLAR MOTIONLESS NOT DARING TO
BREATHE HE GAZED AT HIS CHILD
THE SCARRED VETERAN WAS AFRAID OF THAT
OLD SPINSTER
FROM THIS HAD ARISEN HIS CONNECTION WITH THE CURE OF VERNON M
L'ABBE
MABEUF
THAT WORTHY PRIEST WAS THE BROTHER OF A WARDEN OF SAINT SULPICE WHO HAD
OFTEN OBSERVED THIS MAN GAZING AT HIS CHILD AND THE SCAR ON HIS CHEEK
AND THE LARGE TEARS IN HIS EYES
THAT MAN WHO HAD SO MANLY AN AIR YET
WHO WAS WEEPING LIKE A WOMAN HAD STRUCK THE WARDEN
THAT FACE HAD CLUNG
TO HIS MIND
ONE DAY HAVING GONE TO VERNON TO SEE HIS BROTHER HE HAD
ENCOUNTERED COLONEL PONTMERCY ON THE BRIDGE AND HAD RECOGNIZED THE MAN
OF SAINT SULPICE
THE WARDEN HAD MENTIONED THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE CURE
AND BOTH HAD PAID THE COLONEL A VISIT ON SOME PRETEXT OR OTHER
THIS
VISIT LED TO OTHERS
THE COLONEL WHO HAD BEEN EXTREMELY RESERVED AT
FIRST ENDED BY OPENING HIS HEART AND THE CURE AND THE WARDEN FINALLY
CAME TO KNOW THE WHOLE HISTORY AND HOW PONTMERCY WAS SACRIFICING HIS
HAPPINESS TO HIS CHILD'S FUTURE
THIS CAUSED THE CURE TO REGARD HIM WITH
VENERATION AND TENDERNESS AND THE COLONEL ON HIS SIDE BECAME FOND
OF THE CURE
AND MOREOVER WHEN BOTH ARE SINCERE AND GOOD NO MEN SO
PENETRATE EACH OTHER AND SO AMALGAMATE WITH EACH OTHER AS AN OLD
PRIEST AND AN OLD SOLDIER
AT BOTTOM THE MAN IS THE SAME
THE ONE HAS
DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO HIS COUNTRY HERE BELOW THE OTHER TO HIS COUNTRY ON
HIGH THAT IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
TWICE A YEAR ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY AND ON ST
GEORGE'S DAY MARIUS
WROTE DUTY LETTERS TO HIS FATHER WHICH WERE DICTATED BY HIS AUNT AND
WHICH ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED TO BE COPIED FROM SOME FORMULA THIS WAS
ALL THAT M
GILLENORMAND TOLERATED AND THE FATHER ANSWERED THEM WITH
VERY TENDER LETTERS WHICH THE GRANDFATHER THRUST INTO HIS POCKET UNREAD
CHAPTER III REQUIESCANT
MADAME DE T 'S SALON WAS ALL THAT MARIUS PONTMERCY KNEW OF THE WORLD
IT
WAS THE ONLY OPENING THROUGH WHICH HE COULD GET A GLIMPSE OF LIFE
THIS
OPENING WAS SOMBRE AND MORE COLD THAN WARMTH MORE NIGHT THAN DAY CAME
TO HIM THROUGH THIS SKYLIGHT
THIS CHILD WHO HAD BEEN ALL JOY AND LIGHT
ON ENTERING THIS STRANGE WORLD SOON BECAME MELANCHOLY AND WHAT IS
STILL MORE CONTRARY TO HIS AGE GRAVE
SURROUNDED BY ALL THOSE SINGULAR
AND IMPOSING PERSONAGES HE GAZED ABOUT HIM WITH SERIOUS AMAZEMENT
EVERYTHING CONSPIRED TO INCREASE THIS ASTONISHMENT IN HIM
THERE WERE
IN MADAME DE T 'S SALON SOME VERY NOBLE LADIES NAMED MATHAN NOE
LEVIS WHICH WAS PRONOUNCED LEVI CAMBIS PRONOUNCED CAMBYSE
THESE
ANTIQUE VISAGES AND THESE BIBLICAL NAMES MINGLED IN THE CHILD'S MIND
WITH THE OLD TESTAMENT WHICH HE WAS LEARNING BY HEART AND WHEN THEY
WERE ALL THERE SEATED IN A CIRCLE AROUND A DYING FIRE SPARELY LIGHTED
BY A LAMP SHADED WITH GREEN WITH THEIR SEVERE PROFILES THEIR GRAY OR
WHITE HAIR THEIR LONG GOWNS OF ANOTHER AGE WHOSE LUGUBRIOUS COLORS
COULD NOT BE DISTINGUISHED DROPPING AT RARE INTERVALS WORDS WHICH
WERE BOTH MAJESTIC AND SEVERE LITTLE MARIUS STARED AT THEM WITH
FRIGHTENED EYES IN THE CONVICTION THAT HE BEHELD NOT WOMEN BUT
PATRIARCHS AND MAGI NOT REAL BEINGS BUT PHANTOMS
WITH THESE PHANTOMS PRIESTS WERE SOMETIMES MINGLED FREQUENTERS OF
THIS ANCIENT SALON AND SOME GENTLEMEN THE MARQUIS DE SASS PRIVATE
SECRETARY TO MADAME DE BERRY THE VICOMTE DE VAL WHO PUBLISHED
UNDER THE PSEUDONYME OF CHARLES ANTOINE MONORHYMED ODES THE PRINCE DE
BEAUFF WHO THOUGH VERY YOUNG HAD A GRAY HEAD AND A PRETTY AND
WITTY WIFE WHOSE VERY LOW NECKED TOILETTES OF SCARLET VELVET WITH GOLD
TORSADES ALARMED THESE SHADOWS THE MARQUIS DE C D'E THE MAN
IN ALL FRANCE WHO BEST UNDERSTOOD PROPORTIONED POLITENESS THE COMTE
D'AM THE KINDLY MAN WITH THE AMIABLE CHIN AND THE CHEVALIER DE
PORT DE GUY A PILLAR OF THE LIBRARY OF THE LOUVRE CALLED THE KING'S
CABINET M
DE PORT DE GUY BALD AND RATHER AGED THAN OLD WAS WONT
TO RELATE THAT IN 1793 AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN HE HAD BEEN PUT IN THE
GALLEYS AS REFRACTORY AND CHAINED WITH AN OCTOGENARIAN THE BISHOP
OF MIREPOIX ALSO REFRACTORY BUT AS A PRIEST WHILE HE WAS SO IN THE
CAPACITY OF A SOLDIER
THIS WAS AT TOULON
THEIR BUSINESS WAS TO GO AT
NIGHT AND GATHER UP ON THE SCAFFOLD THE HEADS AND BODIES OF THE PERSONS
WHO HAD BEEN GUILLOTINED DURING THE DAY THEY BORE AWAY ON THEIR BACKS
THESE DRIPPING CORPSES AND THEIR RED GALLEY SLAVE BLOUSES HAD A CLOT OF
BLOOD AT THE BACK OF THE NECK WHICH WAS DRY IN THE MORNING AND WET AT
NIGHT
THESE TRAGIC TALES ABOUNDED IN MADAME DE T 'S SALON AND BY
DINT OF CURSING MARAT THEY APPLAUDED TRESTAILLON
SOME DEPUTIES OF THE
UNDISCOVERABLE VARIETY PLAYED THEIR WHIST THERE M
THIBORD DU CHALARD
M
LEMARCHANT DE GOMICOURT AND THE CELEBRATED SCOFFER OF THE RIGHT M
CORNET DINCOURT
THE BAILIFF DE FERRETTE WITH HIS SHORT BREECHES
AND HIS THIN LEGS SOMETIMES TRAVERSED THIS SALON ON HIS WAY TO M
DE
TALLEYRAND
HE HAD BEEN M
LE COMTE D'ARTOIS' COMPANION IN PLEASURES AND
UNLIKE ARISTOTLE CROUCHING UNDER CAMPASPE HE HAD MADE THE GUIMARD CRAWL
ON ALL FOURS AND IN THAT WAY HE HAD EXHIBITED TO THE AGES A PHILOSOPHER
AVENGED BY A BAILIFF
AS FOR THE PRIESTS THERE WAS THE ABBE HALMA THE
SAME TO WHOM M
LAROSE HIS COLLABORATOR ON LA FOUDRE SAID BAH WHO
IS THERE WHO IS NOT FIFTY YEARS OLD A FEW GREENHORNS PERHAPS THE ABBE
LETOURNEUR PREACHER TO THE KING THE ABBE FRAYSSINOUS WHO WAS NOT AS
YET EITHER COUNT OR BISHOP OR MINISTER OR PEER AND WHO WORE AN OLD
CASSOCK WHOSE BUTTONS WERE MISSING AND THE ABBE KERAVENANT CURE OF
SAINT GERMAIN DES PRES ALSO THE POPE'S NUNCIO THEN MONSIGNOR MACCHI
ARCHBISHOP OF NISIBI LATER ON CARDINAL REMARKABLE FOR HIS LONG
PENSIVE NOSE AND ANOTHER MONSIGNOR ENTITLED THUS ABBATE PALMIERI
DOMESTIC PRELATE ONE OF THE SEVEN PARTICIPANT PROTHONOTARIES OF THE
HOLY SEE CANON OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS LIBERIAN BASILICA ADVOCATE OF THE
SAINTS POSTULATORE DEI SANTI WHICH REFERS TO MATTERS OF CANONIZATION
AND SIGNIFIES VERY NEARLY MASTER OF REQUESTS OF THE SECTION OF
PARADISE
LASTLY TWO CARDINALS M
DE LA LUZERNE AND M
DE CL
T
THE CARDINAL OF LUZERNE WAS A WRITER AND WAS DESTINED TO HAVE
A FEW YEARS LATER THE HONOR OF SIGNING IN THE CONSERVATEUR ARTICLES
SIDE BY SIDE WITH CHATEAUBRIAND M
DE CL T WAS ARCHBISHOP
OF TOUL AND OFTEN MADE TRIPS TO PARIS TO HIS NEPHEW THE MARQUIS
DE T WHO WAS MINISTER OF MARINE AND WAR
THE CARDINAL OF
CL T WAS A MERRY LITTLE MAN WHO DISPLAYED HIS RED
STOCKINGS BENEATH HIS TUCKED UP CASSOCK HIS SPECIALTY WAS A HATRED OF
THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND HIS DESPERATE PLAY AT BILLIARDS AND PERSONS WHO
AT THAT EPOCH PASSED THROUGH THE RUE M ON SUMMER EVENINGS WHERE
THE HOTEL DE CL T THEN STOOD HALTED TO LISTEN TO THE SHOCK
OF THE BALLS AND THE PIERCING VOICE OF THE CARDINAL SHOUTING TO HIS
CONCLAVIST MONSEIGNEUR COTIRET BISHOP IN PARTIBUS OF CARYSTE MARK
ABBE I MAKE A CANNON THE CARDINAL DE CL T HAD BEEN
BROUGHT TO MADAME DE T 'S BY HIS MOST INTIMATE FRIEND M
DE ROQUELAURE
FORMER BISHOP OF SENLIS AND ONE OF THE FORTY
M
DE ROQUELAURE WAS
NOTABLE FOR HIS LOFTY FIGURE AND HIS ASSIDUITY AT THE ACADEMY THROUGH
THE GLASS DOOR OF THE NEIGHBORING HALL OF THE LIBRARY WHERE THE FRENCH
ACADEMY THEN HELD ITS MEETINGS THE CURIOUS COULD ON EVERY TUESDAY
CONTEMPLATE THE EX BISHOP OF SENLIS USUALLY STANDING ERECT FRESHLY
POWDERED IN VIOLET HOSE WITH HIS BACK TURNED TO THE DOOR APPARENTLY
FOR THE PURPOSE OF ALLOWING A BETTER VIEW OF HIS LITTLE COLLAR
ALL
THESE ECCLESIASTICS THOUGH FOR THE MOST PART AS MUCH COURTIERS AS
CHURCHMEN ADDED TO THE GRAVITY OF THE T
SALON WHOSE SEIGNIORIAL
ASPECT WAS ACCENTUATED BY FIVE PEERS OF FRANCE THE MARQUIS DE VIB
THE MARQUIS DE TAL THE MARQUIS DE HERB THE VICOMTE DAMB
AND THE DUC DE VAL
THIS DUC DE VAL ALTHOUGH PRINCE DE
MON THAT IS TO SAY A REIGNING PRINCE ABROAD HAD SO HIGH AN IDEA OF
FRANCE AND ITS PEERAGE THAT HE VIEWED EVERYTHING THROUGH THEIR MEDIUM
IT WAS HE WHO SAID THE CARDINALS ARE THE PEERS OF FRANCE OF ROME
THE LORDS ARE THE PEERS OF FRANCE OF ENGLAND MOREOVER AS IT IS
INDISPENSABLE THAT THE REVOLUTION SHOULD BE EVERYWHERE IN THIS CENTURY
THIS FEUDAL SALON WAS AS WE HAVE SAID DOMINATED BY A BOURGEOIS
M
GILLENORMAND REIGNED THERE
THERE LAY THE ESSENCE AND QUINTESSENCE OF THE PARISIAN WHITE SOCIETY
THERE REPUTATIONS EVEN ROYALIST REPUTATIONS WERE HELD IN QUARANTINE
THERE IS ALWAYS A TRACE OF ANARCHY IN RENOWN
CHATEAUBRIAND HAD HE
ENTERED THERE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED THE EFFECT OF PERE DUCHENE
SOME OF
THE SCOFFED AT DID NEVERTHELESS PENETRATE THITHER ON SUFFERANCE
COMTE
BEUG WAS RECEIVED THERE SUBJECT TO CORRECTION
THE NOBLE SALONS OF THE PRESENT DAY NO LONGER RESEMBLE THOSE SALONS
THE FAUBOURG SAINT GERMAIN REEKS OF THE FAGOT EVEN NOW
THE ROYALISTS OF
TO DAY ARE DEMAGOGUES LET US RECORD IT TO THEIR CREDIT
AT MADAME DE T 'S THE SOCIETY WAS SUPERIOR TASTE WAS EXQUISITE AND
HAUGHTY UNDER THE COVER OF A GREAT SHOW OF POLITENESS
MANNERS THERE
ADMITTED OF ALL SORTS OF INVOLUNTARY REFINEMENTS WHICH WERE THE OLD
REGIME ITSELF BURIED BUT STILL ALIVE
SOME OF THESE HABITS ESPECIALLY
IN THE MATTER OF LANGUAGE SEEM ECCENTRIC
PERSONS BUT SUPERFICIALLY
ACQUAINTED WITH THEM WOULD HAVE TAKEN FOR PROVINCIAL THAT WHICH WAS ONLY
ANTIQUE
A WOMAN WAS CALLED MADAME LA GENERALE
MADAME LA COLONELLE WAS
NOT ENTIRELY DISUSED
THE CHARMING MADAME DE LEON IN MEMORY NO
DOUBT OF THE DUCHESSES DE LONGUEVILLE AND DE CHEVREUSE PREFERRED THIS
APPELLATION TO HER TITLE OF PRINCESSE
THE MARQUISE DE CREQUY WAS ALSO
CALLED MADAME LA COLONELLE
IT WAS THIS LITTLE HIGH SOCIETY WHICH INVENTED AT THE TUILERIES THE
REFINEMENT OF SPEAKING TO THE KING IN PRIVATE AS THE KING IN THE THIRD
PERSON AND NEVER AS YOUR MAJESTY THE DESIGNATION OF YOUR MAJESTY
HAVING BEEN SOILED BY THE USURPER
MEN AND DEEDS WERE BROUGHT TO JUDGMENT THERE
THEY JEERED AT THE AGE
WHICH RELEASED THEM FROM THE NECESSITY OF UNDERSTANDING IT
THEY ABETTED
EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT
THEY COMMUNICATED TO EACH OTHER THAT MODICUM
OF LIGHT WHICH THEY POSSESSED
METHUSELAH BESTOWED INFORMATION ON
EPIMENIDES
THE DEAF MAN MADE THE BLIND MAN ACQUAINTED WITH THE COURSE
OF THINGS
THEY DECLARED THAT THE TIME WHICH HAD ELASPED SINCE COBLENTZ
HAD NOT EXISTED
IN THE SAME MANNER THAT LOUIS XVIII
WAS BY THE GRACE
OF GOD IN THE FIVE AND TWENTIETH YEAR OF HIS REIGN THE EMIGRANTS WERE
BY RIGHTS IN THE FIVE AND TWENTIETH YEAR OF THEIR ADOLESCENCE
ALL WAS HARMONIOUS NOTHING WAS TOO MUCH ALIVE SPEECH HARDLY AMOUNTED
TO A BREATH THE NEWSPAPERS AGREEING WITH THE SALONS SEEMED A PAPYRUS
THERE WERE SOME YOUNG PEOPLE BUT THEY WERE RATHER DEAD
THE LIVERIES IN
THE ANTECHAMBER WERE ANTIQUATED
THESE UTTERLY OBSOLETE PERSONAGES WERE
SERVED BY DOMESTICS OF THE SAME STAMP
THEY ALL HAD THE AIR OF HAVING LIVED A LONG TIME AGO AND OF OBSTINATELY
RESISTING THE SEPULCHRE
NEARLY THE WHOLE DICTIONARY CONSISTED OF
CONSERVER CONSERVATION CONSERVATEUR TO BE IN GOOD ODOR THAT WAS THE
POINT
THERE ARE IN FACT AROMATICS IN THE OPINIONS OF THESE VENERABLE
GROUPS AND THEIR IDEAS SMELLED OF IT
IT WAS A MUMMIFIED SOCIETY
THE
MASTERS WERE EMBALMED THE SERVANTS WERE STUFFED WITH STRAW
A WORTHY OLD MARQUISE AN EMIGREE AND RUINED WHO HAD BUT A SOLITARY
MAID CONTINUED TO SAY MY PEOPLE
WHAT DID THEY DO IN MADAME DE T 'S SALON THEY WERE ULTRA
TO BE ULTRA THIS WORD ALTHOUGH WHAT IT REPRESENTS MAY NOT HAVE
DISAPPEARED HAS NO LONGER ANY MEANING AT THE PRESENT DAY
LET US
EXPLAIN IT
TO BE ULTRA IS TO GO BEYOND
IT IS TO ATTACK THE SCEPTRE IN THE NAME OF
THE THRONE AND THE MITRE IN THE NAME OF THE ATTAR IT IS TO ILL TREAT
THE THING WHICH ONE IS DRAGGING IT IS TO KICK OVER THE TRACES IT IS
TO CAVIL AT THE FAGOT ON THE SCORE OF THE AMOUNT OF COOKING RECEIVED BY
HERETICS IT IS TO REPROACH THE IDOL WITH ITS SMALL AMOUNT OF IDOLATRY
IT IS TO INSULT THROUGH EXCESS OF RESPECT IT IS TO DISCOVER THAT THE
POPE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY PAPISH THAT THE KING IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY
ROYAL AND THAT THE NIGHT HAS TOO MUCH LIGHT IT IS TO BE DISCONTENTED
WITH ALABASTER WITH SNOW WITH THE SWAN AND THE LILY IN THE NAME OF
WHITENESS IT IS TO BE A PARTISAN OF THINGS TO THE POINT OF BECOMING
THEIR ENEMY IT IS TO BE SO STRONGLY FOR AS TO BE AGAINST
THE ULTRA SPIRIT ESPECIALLY CHARACTERIZES THE FIRST PHASE OF THE
RESTORATION
NOTHING IN HISTORY RESEMBLES THAT QUARTER OF AN HOUR WHICH BEGINS IN
1814 AND TERMINATES ABOUT 1820 WITH THE ADVENT OF M
DE VILLELE
THE PRACTICAL MAN OF THE RIGHT
THESE SIX YEARS WERE AN EXTRAORDINARY
MOMENT AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME BRILLIANT AND GLOOMY SMILING AND
SOMBRE ILLUMINATED AS BY THE RADIANCE OF DAWN AND ENTIRELY COVERED AT
THE SAME TIME WITH THE SHADOWS OF THE GREAT CATASTROPHES WHICH STILL
FILLED THE HORIZON AND WERE SLOWLY SINKING INTO THE PAST
THERE EXISTED
IN THAT LIGHT AND THAT SHADOW A COMPLETE LITTLE NEW AND OLD WORLD
COMIC AND SAD JUVENILE AND SENILE WHICH WAS RUBBING ITS EYES NOTHING
RESEMBLES AN AWAKENING LIKE A RETURN A GROUP WHICH REGARDED FRANCE
WITH ILL TEMPER AND WHICH FRANCE REGARDED WITH IRONY GOOD OLD OWLS
OF MARQUISES BY THE STREETFUL WHO HAD RETURNED AND OF GHOSTS THE
FORMER SUBJECTS OF AMAZEMENT AT EVERYTHING BRAVE AND NOBLE GENTLEMEN
WHO SMILED AT BEING IN FRANCE BUT WEPT ALSO DELIGHTED TO BEHOLD
THEIR COUNTRY ONCE MORE IN DESPAIR AT NOT FINDING THEIR MONARCHY THE
NOBILITY OF THE CRUSADES TREATING THE NOBILITY OF THE EMPIRE THAT IS TO
SAY THE NOBILITY OF THE SWORD WITH SCORN HISTORIC RACES WHO HAD
LOST THE SENSE OF HISTORY THE SONS OF THE COMPANIONS OF CHARLEMAGNE
DISDAINING THE COMPANIONS OF NAPOLEON
THE SWORDS AS WE HAVE JUST
REMARKED RETURNED THE INSULT THE SWORD OF FONTENOY WAS LAUGHABLE AND
NOTHING BUT A SCRAP OF RUSTY IRON THE SWORD OF MARENGO WAS ODIOUS AND
WAS ONLY A SABRE
FORMER DAYS DID NOT RECOGNIZE YESTERDAY
PEOPLE NO
LONGER HAD THE FEELING FOR WHAT WAS GRAND
THERE WAS SOME ONE WHO CALLED
BONAPARTE SCAPIN
THIS SOCIETY NO LONGER EXISTS
NOTHING OF IT WE
REPEAT EXISTS TO DAY
WHEN WE SELECT FROM IT SOME ONE FIGURE AT RANDOM
AND ATTEMPT TO MAKE IT LIVE AGAIN IN THOUGHT IT SEEMS AS STRANGE TO US
AS THE WORLD BEFORE THE DELUGE
IT IS BECAUSE IT TOO AS A MATTER OF
FACT HAS BEEN ENGULFED IN A DELUGE
IT HAS DISAPPEARED BENEATH TWO
REVOLUTIONS
WHAT BILLOWS ARE IDEAS HOW QUICKLY THEY COVER ALL THAT IT
IS THEIR MISSION TO DESTROY AND TO BURY AND HOW PROMPTLY THEY CREATE
FRIGHTFUL GULFS
SUCH WAS THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE SALONS OF THOSE DISTANT AND CANDID TIMES
WHEN M
MARTAINVILLE HAD MORE WIT THAN VOLTAIRE
THESE SALONS HAD A LITERATURE AND POLITICS OF THEIR OWN
THEY BELIEVED
IN FIEVEE
M
AGIER LAID DOWN THE LAW IN THEM
THEY COMMENTATED M
COLNET THE OLD BOOKSELLER AND PUBLICIST OF THE QUAY MALAQUAIS
NAPOLEON
WAS TO THEM THOROUGHLY THE CORSICAN OGRE
LATER ON THE INTRODUCTION INTO
HISTORY OF M
LE MARQUIS DE BONAPARTE LIEUTENANT GENERAL OF THE KING'S
ARMIES WAS A CONCESSION TO THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE
THESE SALONS DID NOT LONG PRESERVE THEIR PURITY
BEGINNING WITH 1818
DOCTRINARIANS BEGAN TO SPRING UP IN THEM A DISTURBING SHADE
THEIR WAY
WAS TO BE ROYALISTS AND TO EXCUSE THEMSELVES FOR BEING SO
WHERE THE
ULTRAS WERE VERY PROUD THE DOCTRINARIANS WERE RATHER ASHAMED
THEY HAD
WIT THEY HAD SILENCE THEIR POLITICAL DOGMA WAS SUITABLY IMPREGNATED
WITH ARROGANCE THEY SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED
THEY INDULGED AND USEFULLY
TOO IN EXCESSES IN THE MATTER OF WHITE NECKTIES AND TIGHTLY BUTTONED
COATS
THE MISTAKE OR THE MISFORTUNE OF THE DOCTRINARIAN PARTY WAS TO
CREATE AGED YOUTH
THEY ASSUMED THE POSES OF WISE MEN
THEY DREAMED OF
ENGRAFTING A TEMPERATE POWER ON THE ABSOLUTE AND EXCESSIVE PRINCIPLE
THEY OPPOSED AND SOMETIMES WITH RARE INTELLIGENCE CONSERVATIVE
LIBERALISM TO THE LIBERALISM WHICH DEMOLISHES
THEY WERE HEARD TO SAY
THANKS FOR ROYALISM IT HAS RENDERED MORE THAN ONE SERVICE
IT HAS
BROUGHT BACK TRADITION WORSHIP RELIGION RESPECT
IT IS FAITHFUL
BRAVE CHIVALRIC LOVING DEVOTED
IT HAS MINGLED THOUGH WITH REGRET
THE SECULAR GRANDEURS OF THE MONARCHY WITH THE NEW GRANDEURS OF THE
NATION
ITS MISTAKE IS NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE REVOLUTION THE EMPIRE
GLORY LIBERTY YOUNG IDEAS YOUNG GENERATIONS THE AGE
BUT THIS
MISTAKE WHICH IT MAKES WITH REGARD TO US HAVE WE NOT SOMETIMES BEEN
GUILTY OF IT TOWARDS THEM THE REVOLUTION WHOSE HEIRS WE ARE OUGHT TO
BE INTELLIGENT ON ALL POINTS
TO ATTACK ROYALISM IS A MISCONSTRUCTION OF
LIBERALISM
WHAT AN ERROR AND WHAT BLINDNESS REVOLUTIONARY FRANCE IS
WANTING IN RESPECT TOWARDS HISTORIC FRANCE THAT IS TO SAY TOWARDS ITS
MOTHER THAT IS TO SAY TOWARDS ITSELF
AFTER THE 5TH OF SEPTEMBER THE
NOBILITY OF THE MONARCHY IS TREATED AS THE NOBILITY OF THE EMPIRE WAS
TREATED AFTER THE 5TH OF JULY
THEY WERE UNJUST TO THE EAGLE WE ARE
UNJUST TO THE FLEUR DE LYS
IT SEEMS THAT WE MUST ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING
TO PROSCRIBE DOES IT SERVE ANY PURPOSE TO UNGILD THE CROWN OF LOUIS
XIV TO SCRAPE THE COAT OF ARMS OF HENRY IV WE SCOFF AT M
DE
VAUBLANC FOR ERASING THE N'S FROM THE BRIDGE OF JENA WHAT WAS IT THAT
HE DID WHAT ARE WE DOING BOUVINES BELONGS TO US AS WELL AS MARENGO
THE FLEURS DE LYS ARE OURS AS WELL AS THE N'S
THAT IS OUR PATRIMONY
TO
WHAT PURPOSE SHALL WE DIMINISH IT WE MUST NOT DENY OUR COUNTRY IN THE
PAST ANY MORE THAN IN THE PRESENT
WHY NOT ACCEPT THE WHOLE OF HISTORY
WHY NOT LOVE THE WHOLE OF FRANCE
IT IS THUS THAT DOCTRINARIANS CRITICISED AND PROTECTED ROYALISM WHICH
WAS DISPLEASED AT CRITICISM AND FURIOUS AT PROTECTION
THE ULTRAS MARKED THE FIRST EPOCH OF ROYALISM CONGREGATION
CHARACTERIZED THE SECOND
SKILL FOLLOWS ARDOR
LET US CONFINE OURSELVES
HERE TO THIS SKETCH
IN THE COURSE OF THIS NARRATIVE THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK HAS ENCOUNTERED
IN HIS PATH THIS CURIOUS MOMENT OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY HE HAS BEEN
FORCED TO CAST A PASSING GLANCE UPON IT AND TO TRACE ONCE MORE SOME OF
THE SINGULAR FEATURES OF THIS SOCIETY WHICH IS UNKNOWN TO DAY
BUT HE
DOES IT RAPIDLY AND WITHOUT ANY BITTER OR DERISIVE IDEA
SOUVENIRS BOTH
RESPECTFUL AND AFFECTIONATE FOR THEY TOUCH HIS MOTHER ATTACH HIM TO
THIS PAST
MOREOVER LET US REMARK THIS SAME PETTY WORLD HAD A GRANDEUR
OF ITS OWN
ONE MAY SMILE AT IT BUT ONE CAN NEITHER DESPISE NOR HATE
IT
IT WAS THE FRANCE OF FORMER DAYS
MARIUS PONTMERCY PURSUED SOME STUDIES AS ALL CHILDREN DO
WHEN HE
EMERGED FROM THE HANDS OF AUNT GILLENORMAND HIS GRANDFATHER CONFIDED
HIM TO A WORTHY PROFESSOR OF THE MOST PURELY CLASSIC INNOCENCE
THIS
YOUNG SOUL WHICH WAS EXPANDING PASSED FROM A PRUDE TO A VULGAR PEDANT
MARIUS WENT THROUGH HIS YEARS OF COLLEGE THEN HE ENTERED THE LAW
SCHOOL
HE WAS A ROYALIST FANATICAL AND SEVERE
HE DID NOT LOVE HIS
GRANDFATHER MUCH AS THE LATTER'S GAYETY AND CYNICISM REPELLED HIM AND
HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS HIS FATHER WERE GLOOMY
HE WAS ON THE WHOLE A COLD AND ARDENT NOBLE GENEROUS PROUD
RELIGIOUS ENTHUSIASTIC LAD DIGNIFIED TO HARSHNESS PURE TO SHYNESS
CHAPTER IV END OF THE BRIGAND
THE CONCLUSION OF MARIUS' CLASSICAL STUDIES COINCIDED WITH M
GILLENORMAND'S DEPARTURE FROM SOCIETY
THE OLD MAN BADE FAREWELL TO
THE FAUBOURG SAINT GERMAIN AND TO MADAME DE T 'S SALON AND ESTABLISHED
HIMSELF IN THE MARDIS IN HIS HOUSE OF THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE
THERE HE HAD FOR SERVANTS IN ADDITION TO THE PORTER THAT CHAMBERMAID
NICOLETTE WHO HAD SUCCEEDED TO MAGNON AND THAT SHORT BREATHED AND
PURSY BASQUE WHO HAVE BEEN MENTIONED ABOVE
IN 1827 MARIUS HAD JUST ATTAINED HIS SEVENTEENTH YEAR
ONE EVENING ON
HIS RETURN HOME HE SAW HIS GRANDFATHER HOLDING A LETTER IN HIS HAND
MARIUS SAID M
GILLENORMAND YOU WILL SET OUT FOR VERNON TO MORROW
WHY SAID MARIUS
TO SEE YOUR FATHER
MARIUS WAS SEIZED WITH A TREMBLING FIT
HE HAD THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING
EXCEPT THIS THAT HE SHOULD ONE DAY BE CALLED UPON TO SEE HIS FATHER
NOTHING COULD BE MORE UNEXPECTED MORE SURPRISING AND LET US ADMIT
IT MORE DISAGREEABLE TO HIM
IT WAS FORCING ESTRANGEMENT INTO
RECONCILIATION
IT WAS NOT AN AFFLICTION BUT IT WAS AN UNPLEASANT DUTY
MARIUS IN ADDITION TO HIS MOTIVES OF POLITICAL ANTIPATHY WAS CONVINCED
THAT HIS FATHER THE SLASHER AS M
GILLENORMAND CALLED HIM ON HIS
AMIABLE DAYS DID NOT LOVE HIM THIS WAS EVIDENT SINCE HE HAD ABANDONED
HIM TO OTHERS
FEELING THAT HE WAS NOT BELOVED HE DID NOT LOVE
NOTHING IS MORE SIMPLE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
HE WAS SO ASTOUNDED THAT HE DID NOT QUESTION M
GILLENORMAND
THE
GRANDFATHER RESUMED
IT APPEARS THAT HE IS ILL
HE DEMANDS YOUR PRESENCE
AND AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED
SET OUT TO MORROW MORNING
I THINK THERE IS A COACH WHICH LEAVES THE
COUR DES FONTAINES AT SIX O'CLOCK AND WHICH ARRIVES IN THE EVENING
TAKE IT
HE SAYS THAT HERE IS HASTE
THEN HE CRUSHED THE LETTER IN HIS HAND AND THRUST IT INTO HIS POCKET
MARIUS MIGHT HAVE SET OUT THAT VERY EVENING AND HAVE BEEN WITH HIS
FATHER ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
A DILIGENCE FROM THE RUE DU BOULOI
TOOK THE TRIP TO ROUEN BY NIGHT AT THAT DATE AND PASSED THROUGH VERNON
NEITHER MARIUS NOR M
GILLENORMAND THOUGHT OF MAKING INQUIRIES ABOUT IT
THE NEXT DAY AT TWILIGHT MARIUS REACHED VERNON
PEOPLE WERE JUST
BEGINNING TO LIGHT THEIR CANDLES
HE ASKED THE FIRST PERSON WHOM HE
MET FOR M
PONTMERCY'S HOUSE FOR IN HIS OWN MIND HE AGREED WITH THE
RESTORATION AND LIKE IT DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIS FATHER'S CLAIM TO THE
TITLE OF EITHER COLONEL OR BARON
THE HOUSE WAS POINTED OUT TO HIM
HE RANG A WOMAN WITH A LITTLE LAMP IN
HER HAND OPENED THE DOOR
M
PONTMERCY SAID MARIUS
THE WOMAN REMAINED MOTIONLESS
IS THIS HIS HOUSE DEMANDED MARIUS
THE WOMAN NODDED AFFIRMATIVELY
CAN I SPEAK WITH HIM
THE WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD
BUT I AM HIS SON PERSISTED MARIUS
HE IS EXPECTING ME
HE NO LONGER EXPECTS YOU SAID THE WOMAN
THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS WEEPING
SHE POINTED TO THE DOOR OF A ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR HE ENTERED
IN THAT ROOM WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY A TALLOW CANDLE STANDING ON THE
CHIMNEY PIECE THERE WERE THREE MEN ONE STANDING ERECT ANOTHER
KNEELING AND ONE LYING AT FULL LENGTH ON THE FLOOR IN HIS SHIRT
THE
ONE ON THE FLOOR WAS THE COLONEL
THE OTHER TWO WERE THE DOCTOR AND THE PRIEST WHO WAS ENGAGED IN
PRAYER
THE COLONEL HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY BRAIN FEVER THREE DAYS PREVIOUSLY
AS
HE HAD A FOREBODING OF EVIL AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIS ILLNESS HE
HAD WRITTEN TO M
GILLENORMAND TO DEMAND HIS SON
THE MALADY HAD GROWN
WORSE
ON THE VERY EVENING OF MARIUS' ARRIVAL AT VERNON THE COLONEL HAD
HAD AN ATTACK OF DELIRIUM HE HAD RISEN FROM HIS BED IN SPITE OF THE
SERVANT'S EFFORTS TO PREVENT HIM CRYING MY SON IS NOT COMING I SHALL
GO TO MEET HIM THEN HE RAN OUT OF HIS ROOM AND FELL PROSTRATE ON THE
FLOOR OF THE ANTECHAMBER
HE HAD JUST EXPIRED
THE DOCTOR HAD BEEN SUMMONED AND THE CURE
THE DOCTOR HAD ARRIVED TOO
LATE
THE SON HAD ALSO ARRIVED TOO LATE
BY THE DIM LIGHT OF THE CANDLE A LARGE TEAR COULD BE DISTINGUISHED ON
THE PALE AND PROSTRATE COLONEL'S CHEEK WHERE IT HAD TRICKLED FROM HIS
DEAD EYE
THE EYE WAS EXTINGUISHED BUT THE TEAR WAS NOT YET DRY
THAT
TEAR WAS HIS SON'S DELAY
MARIUS GAZED UPON THAT MAN WHOM HE BEHELD FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THAT
VENERABLE AND MANLY FACE ON THOSE OPEN EYES WHICH SAW NOT ON THOSE
WHITE LOCKS THOSE ROBUST LIMBS ON WHICH HERE AND THERE BROWN
LINES MARKING SWORD THRUSTS AND A SORT OF RED STARS WHICH INDICATED
BULLET HOLES WERE VISIBLE
HE CONTEMPLATED THAT GIGANTIC SEAR WHICH
STAMPED HEROISM ON THAT COUNTENANCE UPON WHICH GOD HAD IMPRINTED
GOODNESS
HE REFLECTED THAT THIS MAN WAS HIS FATHER AND THAT THIS MAN
WAS DEAD AND A CHILL RAN OVER HIM
THE SORROW WHICH HE FELT WAS THE SORROW WHICH HE WOULD HAVE FELT IN THE
PRESENCE OF ANY OTHER MAN WHOM HE HAD CHANCED TO BEHOLD STRETCHED OUT IN
DEATH
ANGUISH POIGNANT ANGUISH WAS IN THAT CHAMBER
THE SERVANT WOMAN WAS
LAMENTING IN A CORNER THE CURE WAS PRAYING AND HIS SOBS WERE AUDIBLE
THE DOCTOR WAS WIPING HIS EYES THE CORPSE ITSELF WAS WEEPING
THE DOCTOR THE PRIEST AND THE WOMAN GAZED AT MARIUS IN THE MIDST OF
THEIR AFFLICTION WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE WAS THE STRANGER THERE
MARIUS WHO WAS FAR TOO LITTLE AFFECTED FELT ASHAMED AND EMBARRASSED AT
HIS OWN ATTITUDE HE HELD HIS HAT IN HIS HAND AND HE DROPPED IT ON THE
FLOOR IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE IMPRESSION THAT GRIEF HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF
THE STRENGTH TO HOLD IT
AT THE SAME TIME HE EXPERIENCED REMORSE AND HE DESPISED HIMSELF FOR
BEHAVING IN THIS MANNER
BUT WAS IT HIS FAULT HE DID NOT LOVE HIS
FATHER WHY SHOULD HE
THE COLONEL HAD LEFT NOTHING
THE SALE OF BIG FURNITURE BARELY PAID THE
EXPENSES OF HIS BURIAL
THE SERVANT FOUND A SCRAP OF PAPER WHICH SHE HANDED TO MARIUS
IT
CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING IN THE COLONEL'S HANDWRITING
FOR MY SON THE EMPEROR MADE ME A BARON ON THE BATTLE FIELD OF
WATERLOO
SINCE THE RESTORATION DISPUTES MY RIGHT TO THIS TITLE WHICH I
PURCHASED WITH MY BLOOD MY SON SHALL TAKE IT AND BEAR IT
THAT HE WILL
BE WORTHY OF IT IS A MATTER OF COURSE BELOW THE COLONEL HAD ADDED
AT THAT SAME BATTLE OF WATERLOO A SERGEANT SAVED MY LIFE
THE MAN'S
NAME WAS THENARDIER
I THINK THAT HE HAS RECENTLY BEEN KEEPING A
LITTLE INN IN A VILLAGE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF PARIS AT CHELLES OR
MONTFERMEIL
IF MY SON MEETS HIM HE WILL DO ALL THE GOOD HE CAN TO
THENARDIER
MARIUS TOOK THIS PAPER AND PRESERVED IT NOT OUT OF DUTY TO HIS FATHER
BUT BECAUSE OF THAT VAGUE RESPECT FOR DEATH WHICH IS ALWAYS IMPERIOUS IN
THE HEART OF MAN
NOTHING REMAINED OF THE COLONEL
M
GILLENORMAND HAD HIS SWORD AND
UNIFORM SOLD TO AN OLD CLOTHES DEALER
THE NEIGHBORS DEVASTATED THE
GARDEN AND PILLAGED THE RARE FLOWERS
THE OTHER PLANTS TURNED TO NETTLES
AND WEEDS AND DIED
MARIUS REMAINED ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS AT VERNON
AFTER THE INTERMENT HE
RETURNED TO PARIS AND APPLIED HIMSELF AGAIN TO HIS LAW STUDIES WITH
NO MORE THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER THAN IF THE LATTER HAD NEVER LIVED
IN TWO
DAYS THE COLONEL WAS BURIED AND IN THREE FORGOTTEN
MARIUS WORE CRAPE ON HIS HAT
THAT WAS ALL
CHAPTER V THE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS IN ORDER TO BECOME A
REVOLUTIONIST
MARIUS HAD PRESERVED THE RELIGIOUS HABITS OF HIS CHILDHOOD
ONE SUNDAY
WHEN HE WENT TO HEAR MASS AT SAINT SULPICE AT THAT SAME CHAPEL OF THE
VIRGIN WHITHER HIS AUNT HAD LED HIM WHEN A SMALL LAD HE PLACED HIMSELF
BEHIND A PILLAR BEING MORE ABSENT MINDED AND THOUGHTFUL THAN USUAL ON
THAT OCCASION AND KNELT DOWN WITHOUT PAYING ANY SPECIAL HEED UPON A
CHAIR OF UTRECHT VELVET ON THE BACK OF WHICH WAS INSCRIBED THIS NAME
MONSIEUR MABEUF WARDEN
MASS HAD HARDLY BEGUN WHEN AN OLD MAN PRESENTED
HIMSELF AND SAID TO MARIUS
THIS IS MY PLACE SIR
MARIUS STEPPED ASIDE PROMPTLY AND THE OLD MAN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS
CHAIR
THE MASS CONCLUDED MARIUS STILL STOOD THOUGHTFULLY A FEW PACES DISTANT
THE OLD MAN APPROACHED HIM AGAIN AND SAID
I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR FOR HAVING DISTURBED YOU A WHILE AGO AND FOR
AGAIN DISTURBING YOU AT THIS MOMENT YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ME INTRUSIVE
AND I WILL EXPLAIN MYSELF
THERE IS NO NEED OF THAT SIR SAID MARIUS
YES WENT ON THE OLD MAN I DO NOT WISH YOU TO HAVE A BAD OPINION OF
ME
YOU SEE I AM ATTACHED TO THIS PLACE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MASS
IS BETTER FROM HERE
WHY I WILL TELL YOU
IT IS FROM THIS PLACE THAT
I HAVE WATCHED A POOR BRAVE FATHER COME REGULARLY EVERY TWO OR THREE
MONTHS FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS SINCE HE HAD NO OTHER OPPORTUNITY AND
NO OTHER WAY OF SEEING HIS CHILD BECAUSE HE WAS PREVENTED BY FAMILY
ARRANGEMENTS
HE CAME AT THE HOUR WHEN HE KNEW THAT HIS SON WOULD BE
BROUGHT TO MASS
THE LITTLE ONE NEVER SUSPECTED THAT HIS FATHER WAS
THERE
PERHAPS HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT HE HAD A FATHER POOR INNOCENT
THE FATHER KEPT BEHIND A PILLAR SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE SEEN
HE GAZED
AT HIS CHILD AND HE WEPT
HE ADORED THAT LITTLE FELLOW POOR MAN I
COULD SEE THAT
THIS SPOT HAS BECOME SANCTIFIED IN MY SIGHT AND I HAVE
CONTRACTED A HABIT OF COMING HITHER TO LISTEN TO THE MASS
I PREFER IT
TO THE STALL TO WHICH I HAVE A RIGHT IN MY CAPACITY OF WARDEN
I KNEW
THAT UNHAPPY GENTLEMAN A LITTLE TOO
HE HAD A FATHER IN LAW A WEALTHY
AUNT RELATIVES I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT ALL WHO THREATENED TO
DISINHERIT THE CHILD IF HE THE FATHER SAW HIM
HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF
IN ORDER THAT HIS SON MIGHT BE RICH AND HAPPY SOME DAY
HE WAS SEPARATED
FROM HIM BECAUSE OF POLITICAL OPINIONS
CERTAINLY I APPROVE OF
POLITICAL OPINIONS BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO STOP
MON DIEU A MAN IS NOT A MONSTER BECAUSE HE WAS AT WATERLOO A FATHER
IS NOT SEPARATED FROM HIS CHILD FOR SUCH A REASON AS THAT
HE WAS ONE OF
BONAPARTE'S COLONELS
HE IS DEAD I BELIEVE
HE LIVED AT VERNON WHERE I
HAVE A BROTHER WHO IS A CURE AND HIS NAME WAS SOMETHING LIKE PONTMARIE
OR MONTPERCY
HE HAD A FINE SWORD CUT ON MY HONOR
PONTMERCY SUGGESTED MARIUS TURNING PALE
PRECISELY PONTMERCY
DID YOU KNOW HIM
SIR SAID MARIUS HE WAS MY FATHER
THE OLD WARDEN CLASPED HIS HANDS AND EXCLAIMED
AH YOU ARE THE CHILD YES THAT'S TRUE HE MUST BE A MAN BY THIS
TIME
WELL POOR CHILD YOU MAY SAY THAT YOU HAD A FATHER WHO LOVED YOU
DEARLY
MARIUS OFFERED HIS ARM TO THE OLD MAN AND CONDUCTED HIM TO HIS LODGINGS
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE SAID TO M
GILLENORMAND
I HAVE ARRANGED A HUNTING PARTY WITH SOME FRIENDS
WILL YOU PERMIT ME
TO BE ABSENT FOR THREE DAYS
FOUR REPLIED HIS GRANDFATHER
GO AND AMUSE YOURSELF
AND HE SAID TO HIS DAUGHTER IN A LOW TONE AND WITH A WINK SOME LOVE
AFFAIR
CHAPTER VI THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDEN
WHERE IT WAS THAT MARIUS WENT WILL BE DISCLOSED A LITTLE FURTHER ON
MARIUS WAS ABSENT FOR THREE DAYS THEN HE RETURNED TO PARIS WENT
STRAIGHT TO THE LIBRARY OF THE LAW SCHOOL AND ASKED FOR THE FILES OF THE
MONITEUR
HE READ THE MONITEUR HE READ ALL THE HISTORIES OF THE REPUBLIC AND
THE EMPIRE THE MEMORIAL DE SAINTE HELENE ALL THE MEMOIRS ALL THE
NEWSPAPERS THE BULLETINS THE PROCLAMATIONS HE DEVOURED EVERYTHING
THE FIRST TIME THAT HE CAME ACROSS HIS FATHER'S NAME IN THE BULLETINS OF
THE GRAND ARMY HE HAD A FEVER FOR A WEEK
HE WENT TO SEE THE GENERALS
UNDER WHOM GEORGES PONTMERCY HAD SERVED AMONG OTHERS COMTE H
CHURCH WARDEN MABEUF WHOM HE WENT TO SEE AGAIN TOLD HIM ABOUT THE LIFE
AT VERNON THE COLONEL'S RETREAT HIS FLOWERS HIS SOLITUDE
MARIUS CAME
TO A FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THAT RARE SWEET AND SUBLIME MAN THAT SPECIES
OF LION LAMB WHO HAD BEEN HIS FATHER
IN THE MEANWHILE OCCUPIED AS HE WAS WITH THIS STUDY WHICH ABSORBED ALL
HIS MOMENTS AS WELL AS HIS THOUGHTS HE HARDLY SAW THE GILLENORMANDS AT
ALL
HE MADE HIS APPEARANCE AT MEALS THEN THEY SEARCHED FOR HIM AND HE
WAS NOT TO BE FOUND
FATHER GILLENORMAND SMILED
BAH BAH HE IS JUST
OF THE AGE FOR THE GIRLS SOMETIMES THE OLD MAN ADDED THE DEUCE
I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY AN AFFAIR OF GALLANTRY IT SEEMS THAT IT IS AN
AFFAIR OF PASSION
IT WAS A PASSION IN FACT
MARIUS WAS ON THE HIGH ROAD TO ADORING HIS
FATHER
AT THE SAME TIME HIS IDEAS UNDERWENT AN EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE
THE
PHASES OF THIS CHANGE WERE NUMEROUS AND SUCCESSIVE
AS THIS IS THE
HISTORY OF MANY MINDS OF OUR DAY WE THINK IT WILL PROVE USEFUL TO
FOLLOW THESE PHASES STEP BY STEP AND TO INDICATE THEM ALL
THAT HISTORY UPON WHICH HE HAD JUST CAST HIS EYES APPALLED HIM
THE FIRST EFFECT WAS TO DAZZLE HIM
UP TO THAT TIME THE REPUBLIC THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN TO HIM ONLY
MONSTROUS WORDS
THE REPUBLIC A GUILLOTINE IN THE TWILIGHT THE EMPIRE
A SWORD IN THE NIGHT
HE HAD JUST TAKEN A LOOK AT IT AND WHERE HE HAD
EXPECTED TO FIND ONLY A CHAOS OF SHADOWS HE HAD BEHELD WITH A SORT
OF UNPRECEDENTED SURPRISE MINGLED WITH FEAR AND JOY STARS SPARKLING
MIRABEAU VERGNIAUD SAINT JUST ROBESPIERRE CAMILLE DESMOULINS
DANTON AND A SUN ARISE NAPOLEON
HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE STOOD
HE
RECOILED BLINDED BY THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS
LITTLE BY LITTLE WHEN HIS
ASTONISHMENT HAD PASSED OFF HE GREW ACCUSTOMED TO THIS RADIANCE HE
CONTEMPLATED THESE DEEDS WITHOUT DIZZINESS HE EXAMINED THESE PERSONAGES
WITHOUT TERROR THE REVOLUTION AND THE EMPIRE PRESENTED THEMSELVES
LUMINOUSLY IN PERSPECTIVE BEFORE HIS MIND'S EYE HE BEHELD EACH OF
THESE GROUPS OF EVENTS AND OF MEN SUMMED UP IN TWO TREMENDOUS FACTS THE
REPUBLIC IN THE SOVEREIGNTY OF CIVIL RIGHT RESTORED TO THE MASSES
THE EMPIRE IN THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE FRENCH IDEA IMPOSED ON EUROPE HE
BEHELD THE GRAND FIGURE OF THE PEOPLE EMERGE FROM THE REVOLUTION AND
THE GRAND FIGURE OF FRANCE SPRING FORTH FROM THE EMPIRE
HE ASSERTED
IN HIS CONSCIENCE THAT ALL THIS HAD BEEN GOOD
WHAT HIS DAZZLED STATE
NEGLECTED IN THIS HIS FIRST FAR TOO SYNTHETIC ESTIMATION WE DO NOT
THINK IT NECESSARY TO POINT OUT HERE
IT IS THE STATE OF A MIND ON THE
MARCH THAT WE ARE RECORDING
PROGRESS IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED IN ONE STAGE
THAT STATED ONCE FOR ALL IN CONNECTION WITH WHAT PRECEDES AS WELL AS
WITH WHAT IS TO FOLLOW WE CONTINUE
HE THEN PERCEIVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD COMPREHENDED HIS
COUNTRY NO MORE THAN HE HAD COMPREHENDED HIS FATHER
HE HAD NOT KNOWN
EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER AND A SORT OF VOLUNTARY NIGHT HAD OBSCURED
HIS EYES
NOW HE SAW AND ON THE ONE HAND HE ADMIRED WHILE ON THE OTHER
HE ADORED
HE WAS FILLED WITH REGRET AND REMORSE AND HE REFLECTED IN DESPAIR THAT
ALL HE HAD IN HIS SOUL COULD NOW BE SAID ONLY TO THE TOMB
OH IF HIS
FATHER HAD STILL BEEN IN EXISTENCE IF HE HAD STILL HAD HIM IF GOD IN
HIS COMPASSION AND HIS GOODNESS HAD PERMITTED HIS FATHER TO BE STILL
AMONG THE LIVING HOW HE WOULD HAVE RUN HOW HE WOULD HAVE PRECIPITATED
HIMSELF HOW HE WOULD HAVE CRIED TO HIS FATHER FATHER HERE I AM IT
IS I I HAVE THE SAME HEART AS THOU I AM THY SON HOW HE WOULD HAVE
EMBRACED THAT WHITE HEAD BATHED HIS HAIR IN TEARS GAZED UPON HIS SCAR
PRESSED HIS HANDS ADORED HIS GARMENT KISSED HIS FEET OH WHY HAD HIS
FATHER DIED SO EARLY BEFORE HIS TIME BEFORE THE JUSTICE THE LOVE OF
HIS SON HAD COME TO HIM MARIUS HAD A CONTINUAL SOB IN HIS HEART WHICH
SAID TO HIM EVERY MOMENT ALAS AT THE SAME TIME HE BECAME MORE TRULY
SERIOUS MORE TRULY GRAVE MORE SURE OF HIS THOUGHT AND HIS FAITH
AT
EACH INSTANT GLEAMS OF THE TRUE CAME TO COMPLETE HIS REASON
AN INWARD
GROWTH SEEMED TO BE IN PROGRESS WITHIN HIM
HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A SORT
OF NATURAL ENLARGEMENT WHICH GAVE HIM TWO THINGS THAT WERE NEW TO
HIM HIS FATHER AND HIS COUNTRY
AS EVERYTHING OPENS WHEN ONE HAS A KEY SO HE EXPLAINED TO HIMSELF THAT
WHICH HE HAD HATED HE PENETRATED THAT WHICH HE HAD ABHORRED HENCEFORTH
HE PLAINLY PERCEIVED THE PROVIDENTIAL DIVINE AND HUMAN SENSE OF THE
GREAT THINGS WHICH HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO DETEST AND OF THE GREAT MEN
WHOM HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO CURSE
WHEN HE REFLECTED ON HIS FORMER
OPINIONS WHICH WERE BUT THOSE OF YESTERDAY AND WHICH NEVERTHELESS
SEEMED TO HIM ALREADY SO VERY ANCIENT HE GREW INDIGNANT YET HE SMILED
FROM THE REHABILITATION OF HIS FATHER HE NATURALLY PASSED TO THE
REHABILITATION OF NAPOLEON
BUT THE LATTER WE WILL CONFESS WAS NOT EFFECTED WITHOUT LABOR
FROM HIS INFANCY HE HAD BEEN IMBUED WITH THE JUDGMENTS OF THE PARTY OF
1814 ON BONAPARTE
NOW ALL THE PREJUDICES OF THE RESTORATION ALL ITS
INTERESTS ALL ITS INSTINCTS TENDED TO DISFIGURE NAPOLEON
IT EXECRATED
HIM EVEN MORE THAN IT DID ROBESPIERRE
IT HAD VERY CLEVERLY TURNED TO
SUFFICIENTLY GOOD ACCOUNT THE FATIGUE OF THE NATION AND THE HATRED OF
MOTHERS
BONAPARTE HAD BECOME AN ALMOST FABULOUS MONSTER AND IN ORDER
TO PAINT HIM TO THE IMAGINATION OF THE PEOPLE WHICH AS WE LATELY
POINTED OUT RESEMBLES THE IMAGINATION OF CHILDREN THE PARTY OF 1814
MADE HIM APPEAR UNDER ALL SORTS OF TERRIFYING MASKS IN SUCCESSION FROM
THAT WHICH IS TERRIBLE THOUGH IT REMAINS GRANDIOSE TO THAT WHICH IS
TERRIBLE AND BECOMES GROTESQUE FROM TIBERIUS TO THE BUGABOO
THUS IN
SPEAKING OF BONAPARTE ONE WAS FREE TO SOB OR TO PUFF UP WITH
LAUGHTER PROVIDED THAT HATRED LAY AT THE BOTTOM
MARIUS HAD NEVER
ENTERTAINED ABOUT THAT MAN AS HE WAS CALLED ANY OTHER IDEAS IN HIS
MIND
THEY HAD COMBINED WITH THE TENACITY WHICH EXISTED IN HIS NATURE
THERE WAS IN HIM A HEADSTRONG LITTLE MAN WHO HATED NAPOLEON
ON READING HISTORY ON STUDYING HIM ESPECIALLY IN THE DOCUMENTS AND
MATERIALS FOR HISTORY THE VEIL WHICH CONCEALED NAPOLEON FROM THE EYES
OF MARIUS WAS GRADUALLY RENT
HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF SOMETHING IMMENSE
AND HE SUSPECTED THAT HE HAD BEEN DECEIVED UP TO THAT MOMENT ON
THE SCORE OF BONAPARTE AS ABOUT ALL THE REST EACH DAY HE SAW MORE
DISTINCTLY AND HE SET ABOUT MOUNTING SLOWLY STEP BY STEP ALMOST
REGRETFULLY IN THE BEGINNING THEN WITH INTOXICATION AND AS THOUGH
ATTRACTED BY AN IRRESISTIBLE FASCINATION FIRST THE SOMBRE STEPS THEN
THE VAGUELY ILLUMINATED STEPS AT LAST THE LUMINOUS AND SPLENDID STEPS
OF ENTHUSIASM
ONE NIGHT HE WAS ALONE IN HIS LITTLE CHAMBER NEAR THE ROOF
HIS CANDLE
WAS BURNING HE WAS READING WITH HIS ELBOWS RESTING ON HIS TABLE CLOSE
TO THE OPEN WINDOW
ALL SORTS OF REVERIES REACHED HIM FROM SPACE AND
MINGLED WITH HIS THOUGHTS
WHAT A SPECTACLE IS THE NIGHT ONE HEARS DULL
SOUNDS WITHOUT KNOWING WHENCE THEY PROCEED ONE BEHOLDS JUPITER WHICH
IS TWELVE HUNDRED TIMES LARGER THAN THE EARTH GLOWING LIKE A FIREBRAND
THE AZURE IS BLACK THE STARS SHINE IT IS FORMIDABLE
HE WAS PERUSING THE BULLETINS OF THE GRAND ARMY THOSE HEROIC STROPHES
PENNED ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE THERE AT INTERVALS HE BEHELD HIS
FATHER'S NAME ALWAYS THE NAME OF THE EMPEROR THE WHOLE OF THAT GREAT
EMPIRE PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM HE FELT A FLOOD SWELLING AND RISING
WITHIN HIM IT SEEMED TO HIM AT MOMENTS THAT HIS FATHER PASSED CLOSE
TO HIM LIKE A BREATH AND WHISPERED IN HIS EAR HE GRADUALLY GOT INTO
A SINGULAR STATE HE THOUGHT THAT HE HEARD DRUMS CANNON TRUMPETS
THE MEASURED TREAD OF BATTALIONS THE DULL AND DISTANT GALLOP OF THE
CAVALRY FROM TIME TO TIME HIS EYES WERE RAISED HEAVENWARD AND GAZED
UPON THE COLOSSAL CONSTELLATIONS AS THEY GLEAMED IN THE MEASURELESS
DEPTHS OF SPACE THEN THEY FELL UPON HIS BOOK ONCE MORE AND THERE THEY
BEHELD OTHER COLOSSAL THINGS MOVING CONFUSEDLY
HIS HEART CONTRACTED
WITHIN HIM
HE WAS IN A TRANSPORT TREMBLING PANTING
ALL AT ONCE
WITHOUT HIMSELF KNOWING WHAT WAS IN HIM AND WHAT IMPULSE HE WAS
OBEYING HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET STRETCHED BOTH ARMS OUT OF THE WINDOW
GAZED INTENTLY INTO THE GLOOM THE SILENCE THE INFINITE DARKNESS THE
ETERNAL IMMENSITY AND EXCLAIMED LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR
FROM THAT MOMENT FORTH ALL WAS OVER THE OGRE OF CORSICA THE
USURPER THE TYRANT THE MONSTER WHO WAS THE LOVER OF HIS OWN
SISTERS THE ACTOR WHO TOOK LESSONS OF TALMA THE POISONER OF
JAFFA THE TIGER BUONAPARTE ALL THIS VANISHED AND GAVE PLACE
IN HIS MIND TO A VAGUE AND BRILLIANT RADIANCE IN WHICH SHONE AT AN
INACCESSIBLE HEIGHT THE PALE MARBLE PHANTOM OF CAESAR
THE EMPEROR HAD
BEEN FOR HIS FATHER ONLY THE WELL BELOVED CAPTAIN WHOM ONE ADMIRES FOR
WHOM ONE SACRIFICES ONE'S SELF HE WAS SOMETHING MORE TO MARIUS
HE WAS
THE PREDESTINED CONSTRUCTOR OF THE FRENCH GROUP SUCCEEDING THE ROMAN
GROUP IN THE DOMINATION OF THE UNIVERSE
HE WAS A PRODIGIOUS ARCHITECT
OF A DESTRUCTION THE CONTINUER OF CHARLEMAGNE OF LOUIS XI OF HENRY
IV OF RICHELIEU OF LOUIS XIV AND OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY
HAVING HIS SPOTS NO DOUBT HIS FAULTS HIS CRIMES EVEN BEING A MAN
THAT IS TO SAY BUT AUGUST IN HIS FAULTS BRILLIANT IN HIS SPOTS
POWERFUL IN HIS CRIME
HE WAS THE PREDESTINED MAN WHO HAD FORCED ALL NATIONS TO SAY THE
GREAT NATION HE WAS BETTER THAN THAT HE WAS THE VERY INCARNATION OF
FRANCE CONQUERING EUROPE BY THE SWORD WHICH HE GRASPED AND THE WORLD
BY THE LIGHT WHICH HE SHED
MARIUS SAW IN BONAPARTE THE DAZZLING SPECTRE
WHICH WILL ALWAYS RISE UPON THE FRONTIER AND WHICH WILL GUARD THE
FUTURE
DESPOT BUT DICTATOR A DESPOT RESULTING FROM A REPUBLIC AND
SUMMING UP A REVOLUTION
NAPOLEON BECAME FOR HIM THE MAN PEOPLE AS JESUS
CHRIST IS THE MAN GOD
IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT LIKE ALL NEW CONVERTS TO A RELIGION HIS
CONVERSION INTOXICATED HIM HE HURLED HIMSELF HEADLONG INTO ADHESION
AND HE WENT TOO FAR
HIS NATURE WAS SO CONSTRUCTED ONCE ON THE DOWNWARD
SLOPE IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PUT ON THE DRAG
FANATICISM
FOR THE SWORD TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM AND COMPLICATED IN HIS MIND HIS
ENTHUSIASM FOR THE IDEA
HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THAT ALONG WITH GENIUS
AND PELL MELL HE WAS ADMITTING FORCE THAT IS TO SAY THAT HE WAS
INSTALLING IN TWO COMPARTMENTS OF HIS IDOLATRY ON THE ONE HAND THAT
WHICH IS DIVINE ON THE OTHER THAT WHICH IS BRUTAL
IN MANY RESPECTS HE
HAD SET ABOUT DECEIVING HIMSELF OTHERWISE
HE ADMITTED EVERYTHING
THERE
IS A WAY OF ENCOUNTERING ERROR WHILE ON ONE'S WAY TO THE TRUTH
HE HAD A
VIOLENT SORT OF GOOD FAITH WHICH TOOK EVERYTHING IN THE LUMP
IN THE NEW
PATH WHICH HE HAD ENTERED ON IN JUDGING THE MISTAKES OF THE OLD REGIME
AS IN MEASURING THE GLORY OF NAPOLEON HE NEGLECTED THE ATTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES
AT ALL EVENTS A TREMENDOUS STEP HAD BEEN TAKEN
WHERE HE HAD FORMERLY
BEHELD THE FALL OF THE MONARCHY HE NOW SAW THE ADVENT OF FRANCE
HIS
ORIENTATION HAD CHANGED
WHAT HAD BEEN HIS EAST BECAME THE WEST
HE HAD
TURNED SQUARELY ROUND
ALL THESE REVOLUTIONS WERE ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN HIM WITHOUT HIS FAMILY
OBTAINING AN INKLING OF THE CASE
WHEN DURING THIS MYSTERIOUS LABOR HE HAD ENTIRELY SHED HIS OLD BOURBON
AND ULTRA SKIN WHEN HE HAD CAST OFF THE ARISTOCRAT THE JACOBITE AND
THE ROYALIST WHEN HE HAD BECOME THOROUGHLY A REVOLUTIONIST PROFOUNDLY
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN HE WENT TO AN ENGRAVER ON THE QUAI DES
ORFEVRES AND ORDERED A HUNDRED CARDS BEARING THIS NAME LE BARON MARIUS
PONTMERCY
THIS WAS ONLY THE STRICTLY LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD
TAKEN PLACE IN HIM A CHANGE IN WHICH EVERYTHING GRAVITATED ROUND HIS
FATHER
ONLY AS HE DID NOT KNOW ANY ONE AND COULD NOT SOW HIS CARDS WITH ANY
PORTER HE PUT THEM IN HIS POCKET
BY ANOTHER NATURAL CONSEQUENCE IN PROPORTION AS HE DREW NEARER TO HIS
FATHER TO THE LATTER'S MEMORY AND TO THE THINGS FOR WHICH THE
COLONEL HAD FOUGHT FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS BEFORE HE RECEDED FROM HIS
GRANDFATHER
WE HAVE LONG AGO SAID THAT M
GILLENORMAND'S TEMPER DID
NOT PLEASE HIM
THERE ALREADY EXISTED BETWEEN THEM ALL THE DISSONANCES
OF THE GRAVE YOUNG MAN AND THE FRIVOLOUS OLD MAN
THE GAYETY OF GERONTE
SHOCKS AND EXASPERATES THE MELANCHOLY OF WERTHER
SO LONG AS THE SAME
POLITICAL OPINIONS AND THE SAME IDEAS HAD BEEN COMMON TO THEM BOTH
MARIUS HAD MET M
GILLENORMAND THERE AS ON A BRIDGE
WHEN THE BRIDGE
FELL AN ABYSS WAS FORMED
AND THEN OVER AND ABOVE ALL MARIUS
EXPERIENCED UNUTTERABLE IMPULSES TO REVOLT WHEN HE REFLECTED THAT IT
WAS M
GILLENORMAND WHO HAD FROM STUPID MOTIVES TORN HIM RUTHLESSLY
FROM THE COLONEL THUS DEPRIVING THE FATHER OF THE CHILD AND THE CHILD
OF THE FATHER
BY DINT OF PITY FOR HIS FATHER MARIUS HAD NEARLY ARRIVED AT AVERSION
FOR HIS GRANDFATHER
NOTHING OF THIS SORT HOWEVER WAS BETRAYED ON THE EXTERIOR AS WE HAVE
ALREADY SAID
ONLY HE GREW COLDER AND COLDER LACONIC AT MEALS AND RARE
IN THE HOUSE
WHEN HIS AUNT SCOLDED HIM FOR IT HE WAS VERY GENTLE AND
ALLEGED HIS STUDIES HIS LECTURES THE EXAMINATIONS ETC AS A PRETEXT
HIS GRANDFATHER NEVER DEPARTED FROM HIS INFALLIBLE DIAGNOSIS IN LOVE
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
FROM TIME TO TIME MARIUS ABSENTED HIMSELF
WHERE IS IT THAT HE GOES OFF LIKE THIS SAID HIS AUNT
ON ONE OF THESE TRIPS WHICH WERE ALWAYS VERY BRIEF HE WENT TO
MONTFERMEIL IN ORDER TO OBEY THE INJUNCTION WHICH HIS FATHER HAD
LEFT HIM AND HE SOUGHT THE OLD SERGEANT TO WATERLOO THE INN KEEPER
THENARDIER
THENARDIER HAD FAILED THE INN WAS CLOSED AND NO ONE KNEW
WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM
MARIUS WAS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE FOR FOUR DAYS ON
THIS QUEST
HE IS GETTING DECIDEDLY WILD SAID HIS GRANDFATHER
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD NOTICED THAT HE WORE SOMETHING ON HIS BREAST
UNDER HIS SHIRT WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO HIS NECK BY A BLACK RIBBON
CHAPTER VII SOME PETTICOAT
WE HAVE MENTIONED A LANCER
HE WAS A GREAT GRAND NEPHEW OF M
GILLENORMAND ON THE PATERNAL SIDE
WHO LED A GARRISON LIFE OUTSIDE THE FAMILY AND FAR FROM THE DOMESTIC
HEARTH
LIEUTENANT THEODULE GILLENORMAND FULFILLED ALL THE CONDITIONS
REQUIRED TO MAKE WHAT IS CALLED A FINE OFFICER
HE HAD A LADY'S WAIST
A VICTORIOUS MANNER OF TRAILING HIS SWORD AND OF TWIRLING HIS MUSTACHE
IN A HOOK
HE VISITED PARIS VERY RARELY AND SO RARELY THAT MARIUS HAD
NEVER SEEN HIM
THE COUSINS KNEW EACH OTHER ONLY BY NAME
WE THINK
WE HAVE SAID THAT THEODULE WAS THE FAVORITE OF AUNT GILLENORMAND WHO
PREFERRED HIM BECAUSE SHE DID NOT SEE HIM
NOT SEEING PEOPLE PERMITS ONE
TO ATTRIBUTE TO THEM ALL POSSIBLE PERFECTIONS
ONE MORNING MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND THE ELDER RETURNED TO HER
APARTMENT AS MUCH DISTURBED AS HER PLACIDITY WAS CAPABLE OF ALLOWING
MARIUS HAD JUST ASKED HIS GRANDFATHER'S PERMISSION TO TAKE A LITTLE
TRIP ADDING THAT HE MEANT TO SET OUT THAT VERY EVENING
GO HAD BEEN
HIS GRANDFATHER'S REPLY AND M
GILLENORMAND HAD ADDED IN AN ASIDE AS
HE RAISED HIS EYEBROWS TO THE TOP OF HIS FOREHEAD HERE HE IS PASSING
THE NIGHT OUT AGAIN MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND HAD ASCENDED TO
HER CHAMBER GREATLY PUZZLED AND ON THE STAIRCASE HAD DROPPED THIS
EXCLAMATION THIS IS TOO MUCH AND THIS INTERROGATION BUT WHERE IS
IT THAT HE GOES SHE ESPIED SOME ADVENTURE OF THE HEART MORE OR LESS
ILLICIT A WOMAN IN THE SHADOW A RENDEZVOUS A MYSTERY AND SHE WOULD
NOT HAVE BEEN SORRY TO THRUST HER SPECTACLES INTO THE AFFAIR
TASTING A
MYSTERY RESEMBLES GETTING THE FIRST FLAVOR OF A SCANDAL SAINTED SOULS
DO NOT DETEST THIS
THERE IS SOME CURIOSITY ABOUT SCANDAL IN THE SECRET
COMPARTMENTS OF BIGOTRY
SO SHE WAS THE PREY OF A VAGUE APPETITE FOR LEARNING A HISTORY
IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THIS CURIOSITY WHICH AGITATED HER A LITTLE BEYOND
HER WONT SHE TOOK REFUGE IN HER TALENTS AND SET ABOUT SCALLOPING
WITH ONE LAYER OF COTTON AFTER ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE EMBROIDERIES OF THE
EMPIRE AND THE RESTORATION IN WHICH THERE ARE NUMEROUS CART WHEELS
THE WORK WAS CLUMSY THE WORKER CROSS
SHE HAD BEEN SEATED AT THIS FOR
SEVERAL HOURS WHEN THE DOOR OPENED
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND RAISED
HER NOSE
LIEUTENANT THEODULE STOOD BEFORE HER MAKING THE REGULATION
SALUTE
SHE UTTERED A CRY OF DELIGHT
ONE MAY BE OLD ONE MAY BE A
PRUDE ONE MAY BE PIOUS ONE MAY BE AN AUNT BUT IT IS ALWAYS AGREEABLE
TO SEE A LANCER ENTER ONE'S CHAMBER
YOU HERE THEODULE SHE EXCLAIMED
ON MY WAY THROUGH TOWN AUNT
EMBRACE ME
HERE GOES SAID THEODULE
AND HE KISSED HER
AUNT GILLENORMAND WENT TO HER WRITING DESK AND OPENED
IT
YOU WILL REMAIN WITH US A WEEK AT LEAST
I LEAVE THIS VERY EVENING AUNT
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE
MATHEMATICALLY
REMAIN MY LITTLE THEODULE I BESEECH YOU
MY HEART SAYS 'YES BUT MY ORDERS SAY 'NO THE MATTER IS SIMPLE
THEY ARE CHANGING OUR GARRISON WE HAVE BEEN AT MELUN WE ARE BEING
TRANSFERRED TO GAILLON
IT IS NECESSARY TO PASS THROUGH PARIS IN ORDER
TO GET FROM THE OLD POST TO THE NEW ONE
I SAID 'I AM GOING TO SEE MY
AUNT
HERE IS SOMETHING FOR YOUR TROUBLE
AND SHE PUT TEN LOUIS INTO HIS HAND
FOR MY PLEASURE YOU MEAN TO SAY MY DEAR AUNT
THEODULE KISSED HER AGAIN AND SHE EXPERIENCED THE JOY OF HAVING SOME OF
THE SKIN SCRATCHED FROM HER NECK BY THE BRAIDINGS ON HIS UNIFORM
ARE YOU MAKING THE JOURNEY ON HORSEBACK WITH YOUR REGIMENT SHE ASKED
HIM
NO AUNT
I WANTED TO SEE YOU
I HAVE SPECIAL PERMISSION
MY SERVANT IS
TAKING MY HORSE I AM TRAVELLING BY DILIGENCE
AND BY THE WAY I WANT
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
WHAT IS IT
IS MY COUSIN MARIUS PONTMERCY TRAVELLING SO TOO
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SAID HIS AUNT SUDDENLY PRICKED TO THE QUICK
WITH A LIVELY CURIOSITY
ON MY ARRIVAL I WENT TO THE DILIGENCE TO ENGAGE MY SEAT IN THE COUPE
WELL
A TRAVELLER HAD ALREADY COME TO ENGAGE A SEAT IN THE IMPERIAL
I SAW
HIS NAME ON THE CARD
WHAT NAME
MARIUS PONTMERCY
THE WICKED FELLOW EXCLAIMED HIS AUNT
AH YOUR COUSIN IS NOT A
STEADY LAD LIKE YOURSELF
TO THINK THAT HE IS TO PASS THE NIGHT IN A
DILIGENCE
JUST AS I AM GOING TO DO
BUT YOU IT IS YOUR DUTY IN HIS CASE IT IS WILDNESS
BOSH SAID THEODULE
HERE AN EVENT OCCURRED TO MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND THE ELDER AN IDEA
STRUCK HER
IF SHE HAD BEEN A MAN SHE WOULD HAVE SLAPPED HER BROW
SHE
APOSTROPHIZED THEODULE
ARE YOU AWARE WHETHER YOUR COUSIN KNOWS YOU
NO
I HAVE SEEN HIM BUT HE HAS NEVER DEIGNED TO NOTICE ME
SO YOU ARE GOING TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
HE IN THE IMPERIAL I IN THE COUPE
WHERE DOES THIS DILIGENCE RUN
TO ANDELYS
THEN THAT IS WHERE MARIUS IS GOING
UNLESS LIKE MYSELF HE SHOULD STOP ON THE WAY
I GET DOWN AT VERNON
IN ORDER TO TAKE THE BRANCH COACH FOR GAILLON
I KNOW NOTHING OF MARIUS'
PLAN OF TRAVEL
MARIUS WHAT AN UGLY NAME WHAT POSSESSED THEM TO NAME HIM MARIUS
WHILE YOU AT LEAST ARE CALLED THEODULE
I WOULD RATHER BE CALLED ALFRED SAID THE OFFICER
LISTEN THEODULE
I AM LISTENING AUNT
PAY ATTENTION
I AM PAYING ATTENTION
YOU UNDERSTAND
YES
WELL MARIUS ABSENTS HIMSELF
EH EH
HE TRAVELS
AH AH
HE SPENDS THE NIGHT OUT
OH OH
WE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THERE IS BEHIND ALL THIS
THEODULE REPLIED WITH THE COMPOSURE OF A MAN OF BRONZE
SOME PETTICOAT OR OTHER
AND WITH THAT INWARD LAUGH WHICH DENOTES CERTAINTY HE ADDED
A LASS
THAT IS EVIDENT EXCLAIMED HIS AUNT WHO THOUGHT SHE HEARD M
GILLENORMAND SPEAKING AND WHO FELT HER CONVICTION BECOME IRRESISTIBLE
AT THAT WORD FILLETTE ACCENTUATED IN ALMOST THE VERY SAME FASHION BY
THE GRANDUNCLE AND THE GRANDNEPHEW
SHE RESUMED
DO US A FAVOR
FOLLOW MARIUS A LITTLE
HE DOES NOT KNOW YOU IT WILL BE
EASY
SINCE A LASS THERE IS TRY TO GET A SIGHT OF HER
YOU MUST WRITE
US THE TALE
IT WILL AMUSE HIS GRANDFATHER
THEODULE HAD NO EXCESSIVE TASTE FOR THIS SORT OF SPYING BUT HE WAS MUCH
TOUCHED BY THE TEN LOUIS AND HE THOUGHT HE SAW A CHANCE FOR A POSSIBLE
SEQUEL
HE ACCEPTED THE COMMISSION AND SAID AS YOU PLEASE AUNT
AND HE ADDED IN AN ASIDE TO HIMSELF HERE I AM A DUENNA
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND EMBRACED HIM
YOU ARE NOT THE MAN TO PLAY SUCH PRANKS THEODULE
YOU OBEY DISCIPLINE
YOU ARE THE SLAVE OF ORDERS YOU ARE A MAN OF SCRUPLES AND DUTY AND YOU
WOULD NOT QUIT YOUR FAMILY TO GO AND SEE A CREATURE
THE LANCER MADE THE PLEASED GRIMACE OF CARTOUCHE WHEN PRAISED FOR HIS
PROBITY
MARIUS ON THE EVENING FOLLOWING THIS DIALOGUE MOUNTED THE DILIGENCE
WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT HE WAS WATCHED
AS FOR THE WATCHER THE
FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO FALL ASLEEP
HIS SLUMBER WAS COMPLETE AND
CONSCIENTIOUS
ARGUS SNORED ALL NIGHT LONG
AT DAYBREAK THE CONDUCTOR OF THE DILIGENCE SHOUTED VERNON RELAY OF
VERNON TRAVELLERS FOR VERNON AND LIEUTENANT THEODULE WOKE
GOOD HE GROWLED STILL HALF ASLEEP THIS IS WHERE I GET OUT
THEN AS HIS MEMORY CLEARED BY DEGREES THE EFFECT OF WAKING HE
RECALLED HIS AUNT THE TEN LOUIS AND THE ACCOUNT WHICH HE HAD
UNDERTAKEN TO RENDER OF THE DEEDS AND PROCEEDINGS OF MARIUS
THIS SET
HIM TO LAUGHING
PERHAPS HE IS NO LONGER IN THE COACH HE THOUGHT AS HE REBUTTONED THE
WAISTCOAT OF HIS UNDRESS UNIFORM
HE MAY HAVE STOPPED AT POISSY HE MAY
HAVE STOPPED AT TRIEL IF HE DID NOT GET OUT AT MEULAN HE MAY HAVE GOT
OUT AT MANTES UNLESS HE GOT OUT AT ROLLEBOISE OR IF HE DID NOT GO ON
AS FAR AS PACY WITH THE CHOICE OF TURNING TO THE LEFT AT EVREUS OR TO
THE RIGHT AT LAROCHE GUYON
RUN AFTER HIM AUNTY
WHAT THE DEVIL AM I TO
WRITE TO THAT GOOD OLD SOUL
AT THAT MOMENT A PAIR OF BLACK TROUSERS DESCENDING FROM THE IMPERIAL
MADE ITS APPEARANCE AT THE WINDOW OF THE COUPE
CAN THAT BE MARIUS SAID THE LIEUTENANT
IT WAS MARIUS
A LITTLE PEASANT GIRL ALL ENTANGLED WITH THE HORSES AND THE POSTILIONS
AT THE END OF THE VEHICLE WAS OFFERING FLOWERS TO THE TRAVELLERS
GIVE
YOUR LADIES FLOWERS SHE CRIED
MARIUS APPROACHED HER AND PURCHASED THE FINEST FLOWERS IN HER FLAT
BASKET
COME NOW SAID THEODULE LEAPING DOWN FROM THE COUPE THIS PIQUES MY
CURIOSITY
WHO THE DEUCE IS HE GOING TO CARRY THOSE FLOWERS TO SHE
MUST BE A SPLENDIDLY HANDSOME WOMAN FOR SO FINE A BOUQUET
I WANT TO SEE
HER
AND NO LONGER IN PURSUANCE OF ORDERS BUT FROM PERSONAL CURIOSITY LIKE
DOGS WHO HUNT ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT HE SET OUT TO FOLLOW MARIUS
MARIUS PAID NO ATTENTION TO THEODULE
ELEGANT WOMEN DESCENDED FROM THE
DILIGENCE HE DID NOT GLANCE AT THEM
HE SEEMED TO SEE NOTHING AROUND
HIM
HE IS PRETTY DEEPLY IN LOVE THOUGHT THEODULE
MARIUS DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE CHURCH
CAPITAL SAID THEODULE TO HIMSELF
RENDEZVOUS SEASONED WITH A BIT OF
MASS ARE THE BEST SORT
NOTHING IS SO EXQUISITE AS AN OGLE WHICH PASSES
OVER THE GOOD GOD'S HEAD
ON ARRIVING AT THE CHURCH MARIUS DID NOT ENTER IT BUT SKIRTED THE
APSE
HE DISAPPEARED BEHIND ONE OF THE ANGLES OF THE APSE
THE RENDEZVOUS IS APPOINTED OUTSIDE SAID THEODULE
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
AT THE LASS
AND HE ADVANCED ON THE TIPS OF HIS BOOTS TOWARDS THE CORNER WHICH MARIUS
HAD TURNED
ON ARRIVING THERE HE HALTED IN AMAZEMENT
MARIUS WITH HIS FOREHEAD CLASPED IN HIS HANDS WAS KNEELING UPON THE
GRASS ON A GRAVE
HE HAD STREWN HIS BOUQUET THERE
AT THE EXTREMITY OF
THE GRAVE ON A LITTLE SWELLING WHICH MARKED THE HEAD THERE STOOD
A CROSS OF BLACK WOOD WITH THIS NAME IN WHITE LETTERS COLONEL BARON
PONTMERCY
MARIUS' SOBS WERE AUDIBLE
THE LASS WAS A GRAVE
CHAPTER VIII MARBLE AGAINST GRANITE
IT WAS HITHER THAT MARIUS HAD COME ON THE FIRST OCCASION OF HIS
ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM PARIS
IT WAS HITHER THAT HE HAD COME EVERY TIME
THAT M
GILLENORMAND HAD SAID HE IS SLEEPING OUT
LIEUTENANT THEODULE WAS ABSOLUTELY PUT OUT OF COUNTENANCE BY THIS
UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER WITH A SEPULCHRE HE EXPERIENCED A SINGULAR AND
DISAGREEABLE SENSATION WHICH HE WAS INCAPABLE OF ANALYZING AND WHICH
WAS COMPOSED OF RESPECT FOR THE TOMB MINGLED WITH RESPECT FOR THE
COLONEL
HE RETREATED LEAVING MARIUS ALONE IN THE CEMETERY AND
THERE WAS DISCIPLINE IN THIS RETREAT
DEATH APPEARED TO HIM WITH LARGE
EPAULETS AND HE ALMOST MADE THE MILITARY SALUTE TO HIM
NOT KNOWING
WHAT TO WRITE TO HIS AUNT HE DECIDED NOT TO WRITE AT ALL AND IT IS
PROBABLE THAT NOTHING WOULD HAVE RESULTED FROM THE DISCOVERY MADE
BY THEODULE AS TO THE LOVE AFFAIRS OF MARIUS IF BY ONE OF THOSE
MYSTERIOUS ARRANGEMENTS WHICH ARE SO FREQUENT IN CHANCE THE SCENE AT
VERNON HAD NOT HAD AN ALMOST IMMEDIATE COUNTER SHOCK AT PARIS
MARIUS RETURNED FROM VERNON ON THE THIRD DAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
MORNING DESCENDED AT HIS GRANDFATHER'S DOOR AND WEARIED BY THE TWO
NIGHTS SPENT IN THE DILIGENCE AND FEELING THE NEED OF REPAIRING HIS
LOSS OF SLEEP BY AN HOUR AT THE SWIMMING SCHOOL HE MOUNTED RAPIDLY TO
HIS CHAMBER TOOK MERELY TIME ENOUGH TO THROW OFF HIS TRAVELLING COAT
AND THE BLACK RIBBON WHICH HE WORE ROUND HIS NECK AND WENT OFF TO THE
BATH
M
GILLENORMAND WHO HAD RISEN BETIMES LIKE ALL OLD MEN IN GOOD HEALTH
HAD HEARD HIS ENTRANCE AND HAD MADE HASTE TO CLIMB AS QUICKLY AS HIS
OLD LEGS PERMITTED THE STAIRS TO THE UPPER STORY WHERE MARIUS LIVED
IN ORDER TO EMBRACE HIM AND TO QUESTION HIM WHILE SO DOING AND TO FIND
OUT WHERE HE HAD BEEN
BUT THE YOUTH HAD TAKEN LESS TIME TO DESCEND THAN THE OLD MAN HAD TO
ASCEND AND WHEN FATHER GILLENORMAND ENTERED THE ATTIC MARIUS WAS NO
LONGER THERE
THE BED HAD NOT BEEN DISTURBED AND ON THE BED LAY OUTSPREAD BUT NOT
DEFIANTLY THE GREAT COAT AND THE BLACK RIBBON
I LIKE THIS BETTER SAID M
GILLENORMAND
AND A MOMENT LATER HE MADE HIS ENTRANCE INTO THE SALON WHERE
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND WAS ALREADY SEATED BUSILY EMBROIDERING HER
CART WHEELS
THE ENTRANCE WAS A TRIUMPHANT ONE
M
GILLENORMAND HELD IN ONE HAND THE GREAT COAT AND IN THE OTHER THE
NECK RIBBON AND EXCLAIMED
VICTORY WE ARE ABOUT TO PENETRATE THE MYSTERY WE ARE GOING TO
LEARN THE MOST MINUTE DETAILS WE ARE GOING TO LAY OUR FINGER ON THE
DEBAUCHERIES OF OUR SLY FRIEND HERE WE HAVE THE ROMANCE ITSELF
I HAVE
THE PORTRAIT
IN FACT A CASE OF BLACK SHAGREEN RESEMBLING A MEDALLION PORTRAIT WAS
SUSPENDED FROM THE RIBBON
THE OLD MAN TOOK THIS CASE AND GAZED AT IT FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT OPENING
IT WITH THAT AIR OF ENJOYMENT RAPTURE AND WRATH WITH WHICH A POOR
HUNGRY FELLOW BEHOLDS AN ADMIRABLE DINNER WHICH IS NOT FOR HIM PASS
UNDER HIS VERY NOSE
FOR THIS EVIDENTLY IS A PORTRAIT
I KNOW ALL ABOUT SUCH THINGS
THAT IS
WORN TENDERLY ON THE HEART
HOW STUPID THEY ARE SOME ABOMINABLE FRIGHT
THAT WILL MAKE US SHUDDER PROBABLY YOUNG MEN HAVE SUCH BAD TASTE
NOWADAYS
LET US SEE FATHER SAID THE OLD SPINSTER
THE CASE OPENED BY THE PRESSURE OF A SPRING
THEY FOUND IN IT NOTHING
BUT A CAREFULLY FOLDED PAPER
FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME SAID M
GILLENORMAND BURSTING WITH
LAUGHTER
I KNOW WHAT IT IS
A BILLET DOUX
AH LET US READ IT SAID THE AUNT
AND SHE PUT ON HER SPECTACLES
THEY UNFOLDED THE PAPER AND READ AS
FOLLOWS
FOR MY SON THE EMPEROR MADE ME A BARON ON THE BATTLEFIELD OF
WATERLOO
SINCE THE RESTORATION DISPUTES MY RIGHT TO THIS TITLE WHICH I
PURCHASED WITH MY BLOOD MY SON SHALL TAKE IT AND BEAR IT
THAT HE WILL
BE WORTHY OF IT IS A MATTER OF COURSE
THE FEELINGS OF FATHER AND DAUGHTER CANNOT BE DESCRIBED
THEY FELT
CHILLED AS BY THE BREATH OF A DEATH'S HEAD
THEY DID NOT EXCHANGE A
WORD
ONLY M
GILLENORMAND SAID IN A LOW VOICE AND AS THOUGH SPEAKING TO
HIMSELF
IT IS THE SLASHER'S HANDWRITING
THE AUNT EXAMINED THE PAPER TURNED IT ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS THEN PUT
IT BACK IN ITS CASE
AT THE SAME MOMENT A LITTLE OBLONG PACKET ENVELOPED IN BLUE PAPER FELL
FROM ONE OF THE POCKETS OF THE GREAT COAT
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND
PICKED IT UP AND UNFOLDED THE BLUE PAPER
IT CONTAINED MARIUS' HUNDRED CARDS
SHE HANDED ONE OF THEM TO M
GILLENORMAND WHO READ LE BARON MARIUS PONTMERCY
THE OLD MAN RANG THE BELL
NICOLETTE CAME
M
GILLENORMAND TOOK THE
RIBBON THE CASE AND THE COAT FLUNG THEM ALL ON THE FLOOR IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND SAID
CARRY THOSE DUDS AWAY
A FULL HOUR PASSED IN THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE
THE OLD MAN AND THE OLD
SPINSTER HAD SEATED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR BACKS TO EACH OTHER AND WERE
THINKING EACH ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT THE SAME THINGS IN ALL PROBABILITY
AT THE EXPIRATION OF THIS HOUR AUNT GILLENORMAND SAID A PRETTY STATE
OF THINGS
A FEW MOMENTS LATER MARIUS MADE HIS APPEARANCE
HE ENTERED
EVEN BEFORE
HE HAD CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE SAW HIS GRANDFATHER HOLDING ONE OF
HIS OWN CARDS IN HIS HAND AND ON CATCHING SIGHT OF HIM THE LATTER
EXCLAIMED WITH HIS AIR OF BOURGEOIS AND GRINNING SUPERIORITY WHICH WAS
SOMETHING CRUSHING
WELL WELL WELL WELL WELL SO YOU ARE A BARON NOW
I PRESENT YOU MY
COMPLIMENTS
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS
MARIUS REDDENED SLIGHTLY AND REPLIED
IT MEANS THAT I AM THE SON OF MY FATHER
M
GILLENORMAND CEASED TO LAUGH AND SAID HARSHLY
I AM YOUR FATHER
MY FATHER RETORTED MARIUS WITH DOWNCAST EYES AND A SEVERE AIR WAS
A HUMBLE AND HEROIC MAN WHO SERVED THE REPUBLIC AND FRANCE GLORIOUSLY
WHO WAS GREAT IN THE GREATEST HISTORY THAT MEN HAVE EVER MADE WHO
LIVED IN THE BIVOUAC FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY BENEATH GRAPE SHOT AND
BULLETS IN SNOW AND MUD BY DAY BENEATH RAIN AT NIGHT WHO CAPTURED TWO
FLAGS WHO RECEIVED TWENTY WOUNDS WHO DIED FORGOTTEN AND ABANDONED AND
WHO NEVER COMMITTED BUT ONE MISTAKE WHICH WAS TO LOVE TOO FONDLY TWO
INGRATES HIS COUNTRY AND MYSELF
THIS WAS MORE THAN M
GILLENORMAND COULD BEAR TO HEAR
AT THE WORD
REPUBLIC HE ROSE OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET
EVERY WORD THAT MARIUS HAD JUST UTTERED PRODUCED ON THE VISAGE OF THE
OLD ROYALIST THE EFFECT OF THE PUFFS OF AIR FROM A FORGE UPON A BLAZING
BRAND
FROM A DULL HUE HE HAD TURNED RED FROM RED PURPLE AND FROM
PURPLE FLAME COLORED
MARIUS HE CRIED
ABOMINABLE CHILD I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOUR FATHER
WAS I DO NOT WISH TO KNOW I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT AND I DO NOT KNOW
HIM BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THERE NEVER WAS ANYTHING BUT SCOUNDRELS
AMONG THOSE MEN THEY WERE ALL RASCALS ASSASSINS RED CAPS THIEVES I
SAY ALL I SAY ALL I KNOW NOT ONE I SAY ALL DO YOU HEAR ME MARIUS
SEE HERE YOU ARE NO MORE A BARON THAN MY SLIPPER IS THEY WERE ALL
BANDITS IN THE SERVICE OF ROBESPIERRE ALL WHO SERVED B U O NAPARTE WERE
BRIGANDS THEY WERE ALL TRAITORS WHO BETRAYED BETRAYED BETRAYED THEIR
LEGITIMATE KING ALL COWARDS WHO FLED BEFORE THE PRUSSIANS AND THE
ENGLISH AT WATERLOO THAT IS WHAT I DO KNOW WHETHER MONSIEUR YOUR
FATHER COMES IN THAT CATEGORY I DO NOT KNOW I AM SORRY FOR IT SO MUCH
THE WORSE YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT
IN HIS TURN IT WAS MARIUS WHO WAS THE FIREBRAND AND M
GILLENORMAND
WHO WAS THE BELLOWS
MARIUS QUIVERED IN EVERY LIMB HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN NEXT HIS BRAIN WAS ON FIRE
HE WAS THE PRIEST WHO BEHOLDS
ALL HIS SACRED WAFERS CAST TO THE WINDS THE FAKIR WHO BEHOLDS A
PASSER BY SPIT UPON HIS IDOL
IT COULD NOT BE THAT SUCH THINGS HAD BEEN
UTTERED IN HIS PRESENCE
WHAT WAS HE TO DO HIS FATHER HAD JUST BEEN
TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT AND STAMPED UPON IN HIS PRESENCE BUT BY WHOM BY
HIS GRANDFATHER
HOW WAS HE TO AVENGE THE ONE WITHOUT OUTRAGING THE
OTHER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO INSULT HIS GRANDFATHER AND IT WAS
EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO LEAVE HIS FATHER UNAVENGED
ON THE ONE
HAND WAS A SACRED GRAVE ON THE OTHER HOARY LOCKS
HE STOOD THERE FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS STAGGERING AS THOUGH INTOXICATED
WITH ALL THIS WHIRLWIND DASHING THROUGH HIS HEAD THEN HE RAISED
HIS EYES GAZED FIXEDLY AT HIS GRANDFATHER AND CRIED IN A VOICE OF
THUNDER
DOWN WITH THE BOURBONS AND THAT GREAT HOG OF A LOUIS XVIII
LOUIS XVIII
HAD BEEN DEAD FOR FOUR YEARS BUT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO
HIM
THE OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN CRIMSON TURNED WHITER THAN HIS HAIR
HE
WHEELED ROUND TOWARDS A BUST OF M
LE DUC DE BERRY WHICH STOOD ON THE
CHIMNEY PIECE AND MADE A PROFOUND BOW WITH A SORT OF PECULIAR MAJESTY
THEN HE PACED TWICE SLOWLY AND IN SILENCE FROM THE FIREPLACE TO THE
WINDOW AND FROM THE WINDOW TO THE FIREPLACE TRAVERSING THE WHOLE LENGTH
OF THE ROOM AND MAKING THE POLISHED FLOOR CREAK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN A
STONE STATUE WALKING
ON HIS SECOND TURN HE BENT OVER HIS DAUGHTER WHO WAS WATCHING THIS
ENCOUNTER WITH THE STUPEFIED AIR OF AN ANTIQUATED LAMB AND SAID TO HER
WITH A SMILE THAT WAS ALMOST CALM A BARON LIKE THIS GENTLEMAN AND A
BOURGEOIS LIKE MYSELF CANNOT REMAIN UNDER THE SAME ROOF
AND DRAWING HIMSELF UP ALL AT ONCE PALLID TREMBLING TERRIBLE WITH
HIS BROW RENDERED MORE LOFTY BY THE TERRIBLE RADIANCE OF WRATH HE
EXTENDED HIS ARM TOWARDS MARIUS AND SHOUTED TO HIM
BE OFF
MARIUS LEFT THE HOUSE
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY M
GILLENORMAND SAID TO HIS DAUGHTER
YOU WILL SEND SIXTY PISTOLES EVERY SIX MONTHS TO THAT BLOOD DRINKER
AND YOU WILL NEVER MENTION HIS NAME TO ME
HAVING AN IMMENSE RESERVE FUND OF WRATH TO GET RID OF AND NOT KNOWING
WHAT TO DO WITH IT HE CONTINUED TO ADDRESS HIS DAUGHTER AS YOU INSTEAD
OF THOU FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS
MARIUS ON HIS SIDE HAD GONE FORTH IN INDIGNATION
THERE WAS ONE
CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IT MUST BE ADMITTED AGGRAVATED HIS EXASPERATION
THERE ARE ALWAYS PETTY FATALITIES OF THE SORT WHICH COMPLICATE DOMESTIC
DRAMAS
THEY AUGMENT THE GRIEVANCES IN SUCH CASES ALTHOUGH IN REALITY
THE WRONGS ARE NOT INCREASED BY THEM
WHILE CARRYING MARIUS' DUDS
PRECIPITATELY TO HIS CHAMBER AT HIS GRANDFATHER'S COMMAND NICOLETTE
HAD INADVERTENTLY LET FALL PROBABLY ON THE ATTIC STAIRCASE WHICH
WAS DARK THAT MEDALLION OF BLACK SHAGREEN WHICH CONTAINED THE PAPER
PENNED BY THE COLONEL
NEITHER PAPER NOR CASE COULD AFTERWARDS BE FOUND
MARIUS WAS CONVINCED THAT MONSIEUR GILLENORMAND FROM THAT DAY FORTH
HE NEVER ALLUDED TO HIM OTHERWISE HAD FLUNG HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT IN
THE FIRE
HE KNEW BY HEART THE FEW LINES WHICH THE COLONEL HAD WRITTEN
AND CONSEQUENTLY NOTHING WAS LOST
BUT THE PAPER THE WRITING THAT
SACRED RELIC ALL THAT WAS HIS VERY HEART
WHAT HAD BEEN DONE WITH IT
MARIUS HAD TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE WITHOUT SAYING WHITHER HE WAS GOING AND
WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE WITH THIRTY FRANCS HIS WATCH AND A FEW CLOTHES
IN A HAND BAG
HE HAD ENTERED A HACKNEY COACH HAD ENGAGED IT BY THE
HOUR AND HAD DIRECTED HIS COURSE AT HAP HAZARD TOWARDS THE LATIN
QUARTER
WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF MARIUS
BOOK FOURTH THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C
CHAPTER I A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORIC
AT THAT EPOCH WHICH WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES INDIFFERENT A CERTAIN
REVOLUTIONARY QUIVER WAS VAGUELY CURRENT
BREATHS WHICH HAD STARTED
FORTH FROM THE DEPTHS OF '89 AND '93 WERE IN THE AIR
YOUTH WAS ON
THE POINT MAY THE READER PARDON US THE WORD OF MOULTING
PEOPLE WERE
UNDERGOING A TRANSFORMATION ALMOST WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF IT
THROUGH THE MOVEMENT OF THE AGE
THE NEEDLE WHICH MOVES ROUND THE
COMPASS ALSO MOVES IN SOULS
EACH PERSON WAS TAKING THAT STEP IN ADVANCE
WHICH HE WAS BOUND TO TAKE
THE ROYALISTS WERE BECOMING LIBERALS
LIBERALS WERE TURNING DEMOCRATS
IT WAS A FLOOD TIDE COMPLICATED WITH
A THOUSAND EBB MOVEMENTS THE PECULIARITY OF EBBS IS TO CREATE
INTERMIXTURES HENCE THE COMBINATION OF VERY SINGULAR IDEAS PEOPLE
ADORED BOTH NAPOLEON AND LIBERTY
WE ARE MAKING HISTORY HERE
THESE
WERE THE MIRAGES OF THAT PERIOD
OPINIONS TRAVERSE PHASES
VOLTAIRIAN
ROYALISM A QUAINT VARIETY HAD A NO LESS SINGULAR SEQUEL BONAPARTIST
LIBERALISM
OTHER GROUPS OF MINDS WERE MORE SERIOUS
IN THAT DIRECTION THEY
SOUNDED PRINCIPLES THEY ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO THE RIGHT
THEY
GREW ENTHUSIASTIC FOR THE ABSOLUTE THEY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF INFINITE
REALIZATIONS THE ABSOLUTE BY ITS VERY RIGIDITY URGES SPIRITS TOWARDS
THE SKY AND CAUSES THEM TO FLOAT IN ILLIMITABLE SPACE
THERE IS NOTHING
LIKE DOGMA FOR BRINGING FORTH DREAMS
AND THERE IS NOTHING LIKE DREAMS
FOR ENGENDERING THE FUTURE
UTOPIA TO DAY FLESH AND BLOOD TO MORROW
THESE ADVANCED OPINIONS HAD A DOUBLE FOUNDATION
A BEGINNING OF MYSTERY
MENACED THE ESTABLISHED ORDER OF THINGS WHICH WAS SUSPICIOUS AND
UNDERHAND
A SIGN WHICH WAS REVOLUTIONARY TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE
THE
SECOND THOUGHTS OF POWER MEET THE SECOND THOUGHTS OF THE POPULACE IN
THE MINE
THE INCUBATION OF INSURRECTIONS GIVES THE RETORT TO THE
PREMEDITATION OF COUPS D'ETAT
THERE DID NOT AS YET EXIST IN FRANCE ANY OF THOSE VAST UNDERLYING
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE GERMAN TUGENDBUND AND ITALIAN CARBONARISM BUT
HERE AND THERE THERE WERE DARK UNDERMININGS WHICH WERE IN PROCESS OF
THROWING OFF SHOOTS
THE COUGOURDE WAS BEING OUTLINED AT AIX THERE
EXISTED AT PARIS AMONG OTHER AFFILIATIONS OF THAT NATURE THE SOCIETY
OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C
WHAT WERE THESE FRIENDS OF THE A B C A SOCIETY WHICH HAD FOR ITS OBJECT
APPARENTLY THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN IN REALITY THE ELEVATION OF MAN
THEY DECLARED THEMSELVES THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C THE ABAISSE THE
DEBASED THAT IS TO SAY THE PEOPLE
THEY WISHED TO ELEVATE THE PEOPLE
IT WAS A PUN WHICH WE SHOULD DO WRONG TO SMILE AT
PUNS ARE SOMETIMES
SERIOUS FACTORS IN POLITICS WITNESS THE CASTRATUS AD CASTRA WHICH MADE
A GENERAL OF THE ARMY OF NARSES WITNESS BARBARI ET BARBERINI WITNESS
TU ES PETRUS ET SUPER HANC PETRAM ETC ETC
THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C WERE NOT NUMEROUS IT WAS A SECRET SOCIETY IN
THE STATE OF EMBRYO WE MIGHT ALMOST SAY A COTERIE IF COTERIES ENDED IN
HEROES
THEY ASSEMBLED IN PARIS IN TWO LOCALITIES NEAR THE FISH MARKET
IN A WINE SHOP CALLED CORINTHE OF WHICH MORE WILL BE HEARD LATER ON
AND NEAR THE PANTHEON IN A LITTLE CAFE IN THE RUE SAINT MICHEL CALLED
THE CAFE MUSAIN NOW TORN DOWN THE FIRST OF THESE MEETING PLACES WAS
CLOSE TO THE WORKINGMAN THE SECOND TO THE STUDENTS
THE ASSEMBLIES OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C WERE USUALLY HELD IN A BACK
ROOM OF THE CAFE MUSAIN
THIS HALL WHICH WAS TOLERABLY REMOTE FROM THE CAFE WITH WHICH IT WAS
CONNECTED BY AN EXTREMELY LONG CORRIDOR HAD TWO WINDOWS AND AN EXIT
WITH A PRIVATE STAIRWAY ON THE LITTLE RUE DES GRES
THERE THEY SMOKED
AND DRANK AND GAMBLED AND LAUGHED
THERE THEY CONVERSED IN VERY LOUD
TONES ABOUT EVERYTHING AND IN WHISPERS OF OTHER THINGS
AN OLD MAP
OF FRANCE UNDER THE REPUBLIC WAS NAILED TO THE WALL A SIGN QUITE
SUFFICIENT TO EXCITE THE SUSPICION OF A POLICE AGENT
THE GREATER PART OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C WERE STUDENTS WHO WERE
ON CORDIAL TERMS WITH THE WORKING CLASSES
HERE ARE THE NAMES OF THE
PRINCIPAL ONES
THEY BELONG IN A CERTAIN MEASURE TO HISTORY ENJOLRAS
COMBEFERRE JEAN PROUVAIRE FEUILLY COURFEYRAC BAHOREL LESGLE OR
LAIGLE JOLY GRANTAIRE
THESE YOUNG MEN FORMED A SORT OF FAMILY THROUGH THE BOND OF FRIENDSHIP
ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LAIGLE WERE FROM THE SOUTH
ILLUSTRATION FRIENDS OF THE A B C 3B4 1 ABC FRIENDS
THIS WAS A REMARKABLE GROUP
IT VANISHED IN THE INVISIBLE DEPTHS WHICH
LIE BEHIND US
AT THE POINT OF THIS DRAMA WHICH WE HAVE NOW REACHED
IT WILL NOT PERHAPS BE SUPERFLUOUS TO THROW A RAY OF LIGHT UPON THESE
YOUTHFUL HEADS BEFORE THE READER BEHOLDS THEM PLUNGING INTO THE SHADOW
OF A TRAGIC ADVENTURE
ENJOLRAS WHOSE NAME WE HAVE MENTIONED FIRST OF ALL THE READER SHALL
SEE WHY LATER ON WAS AN ONLY SON AND WEALTHY
ENJOLRAS WAS A CHARMING YOUNG MAN WHO WAS CAPABLE OF BEING TERRIBLE
HE
WAS ANGELICALLY HANDSOME
HE WAS A SAVAGE ANTINOUS
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID
TO SEE THE PENSIVE THOUGHTFULNESS OF HIS GLANCE THAT HE HAD ALREADY
IN SOME PREVIOUS STATE OF EXISTENCE TRAVERSED THE REVOLUTIONARY
APOCALYPSE
HE POSSESSED THE TRADITION OF IT AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN A
WITNESS
HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE MINUTE DETAILS OF THE GREAT
AFFAIR
A PONTIFICAL AND WARLIKE NATURE A SINGULAR THING IN A YOUTH
HE
WAS AN OFFICIATING PRIEST AND A MAN OF WAR FROM THE IMMEDIATE POINT OF
VIEW A SOLDIER OF THE DEMOCRACY ABOVE THE CONTEMPORARY MOVEMENT THE
PRIEST OF THE IDEAL
HIS EYES WERE DEEP HIS LIDS A LITTLE RED HIS
LOWER LIP WAS THICK AND EASILY BECAME DISDAINFUL HIS BROW WAS LOFTY
A
GREAT DEAL OF BROW IN A FACE IS LIKE A GREAT DEAL OF HORIZON IN A VIEW
LIKE CERTAIN YOUNG MEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY AND THE END OF
THE LAST WHO BECAME ILLUSTRIOUS AT AN EARLY AGE HE WAS ENDOWED WITH
EXCESSIVE YOUTH AND WAS AS ROSY AS A YOUNG GIRL ALTHOUGH SUBJECT TO
HOURS OF PALLOR
ALREADY A MAN HE STILL SEEMED A CHILD
HIS TWO AND
TWENTY YEARS APPEARED TO BE BUT SEVENTEEN HE WAS SERIOUS IT DID NOT
SEEM AS THOUGH HE WERE AWARE THERE WAS ON EARTH A THING CALLED WOMAN
HE HAD BUT ONE PASSION THE RIGHT BUT ONE THOUGHT TO OVERTHROW
THE OBSTACLE
ON MOUNT AVENTINE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GRACCHUS IN THE
CONVENTION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAINT JUST
HE HARDLY SAW THE ROSES HE
IGNORED SPRING HE DID NOT HEAR THE CAROLLING OF THE BIRDS THE BARE
THROAT OF EVADNE WOULD HAVE MOVED HIM NO MORE THAN IT WOULD HAVE MOVED
ARISTOGEITON HE LIKE HARMODIUS THOUGHT FLOWERS GOOD FOR NOTHING
EXCEPT TO CONCEAL THE SWORD
HE WAS SEVERE IN HIS ENJOYMENTS
HE
CHASTELY DROPPED HIS EYES BEFORE EVERYTHING WHICH WAS NOT THE REPUBLIC
HE WAS THE MARBLE LOVER OF LIBERTY
HIS SPEECH WAS HARSHLY INSPIRED
AND HAD THE THRILL OF A HYMN
HE WAS SUBJECT TO UNEXPECTED OUTBURSTS OF
SOUL
WOE TO THE LOVE AFFAIR WHICH SHOULD HAVE RISKED ITSELF BESIDE HIM
IF ANY GRISETTE OF THE PLACE CAMBRAI OR THE RUE SAINT JEAN DE BEAUVAIS
SEEING THAT FACE OF A YOUTH ESCAPED FROM COLLEGE THAT PAGE'S MIEN
THOSE LONG GOLDEN LASHES THOSE BLUE EYES THAT HAIR BILLOWING IN THE
WIND THOSE ROSY CHEEKS THOSE FRESH LIPS THOSE EXQUISITE TEETH HAD
CONCEIVED AN APPETITE FOR THAT COMPLETE AURORA AND HAD TRIED HER BEAUTY
ON ENJOLRAS AN ASTOUNDING AND TERRIBLE GLANCE WOULD HAVE PROMPTLY SHOWN
HER THE ABYSS AND WOULD HAVE TAUGHT HER NOT TO CONFOUND THE MIGHTY
CHERUB OF EZEKIEL WITH THE GALLANT CHERUBINO OF BEAUMARCHAIS
BY THE SIDE OF ENJOLRAS WHO REPRESENTED THE LOGIC OF THE REVOLUTION
COMBEFERRE REPRESENTED ITS PHILOSOPHY
BETWEEN THE LOGIC OF THE
REVOLUTION AND ITS PHILOSOPHY THERE EXISTS THIS DIFFERENCE THAT ITS
LOGIC MAY END IN WAR WHEREAS ITS PHILOSOPHY CAN END ONLY IN PEACE
COMBEFERRE COMPLEMENTED AND RECTIFIED ENJOLRAS
HE WAS LESS LOFTY BUT
BROADER
HE DESIRED TO POUR INTO ALL MINDS THE EXTENSIVE PRINCIPLES OF
GENERAL IDEAS HE SAID REVOLUTION BUT CIVILIZATION AND AROUND THE
MOUNTAIN PEAK HE OPENED OUT A VAST VIEW OF THE BLUE SKY
THE REVOLUTION
WAS MORE ADAPTED FOR BREATHING WITH COMBEFERRE THAN WITH ENJOLRAS
ENJOLRAS EXPRESSED ITS DIVINE RIGHT AND COMBEFERRE ITS NATURAL RIGHT
THE FIRST ATTACHED HIMSELF TO ROBESPIERRE THE SECOND CONFINED HIMSELF
TO CONDORCET
COMBEFERRE LIVED THE LIFE OF ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD
MORE THAN DID ENJOLRAS
IF IT HAD BEEN GRANTED TO THESE TWO YOUNG MEN TO
ATTAIN TO HISTORY THE ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE JUST THE OTHER THE WISE
MAN
ENJOLRAS WAS THE MORE VIRILE COMBEFERRE THE MORE HUMANE
HOMO AND
VIR THAT WAS THE EXACT EFFECT OF THEIR DIFFERENT SHADES
COMBEFERRE WAS
AS GENTLE AS ENJOLRAS WAS SEVERE THROUGH NATURAL WHITENESS
HE LOVED
THE WORD CITIZEN BUT HE PREFERRED THE WORD MAN
HE WOULD GLADLY
HAVE SAID HOMBRE LIKE THE SPANISH
HE READ EVERYTHING WENT TO
THE THEATRES ATTENDED THE COURSES OF PUBLIC LECTURERS LEARNED THE
POLARIZATION OF LIGHT FROM ARAGO GREW ENTHUSIASTIC OVER A LESSON IN
WHICH GEOFFREY SAINTE HILAIRE EXPLAINED THE DOUBLE FUNCTION OF THE
EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY AND THE INTERNAL THE ONE WHICH MAKES THE FACE
AND THE ONE WHICH MAKES THE BRAIN HE KEPT UP WITH WHAT WAS GOING
ON FOLLOWED SCIENCE STEP BY STEP COMPARED SAINT SIMON WITH FOURIER
DECIPHERED HIEROGLYPHICS BROKE THE PEBBLE WHICH HE FOUND AND REASONED
ON GEOLOGY DREW FROM MEMORY A SILKWORM MOTH POINTED OUT THE FAULTY
FRENCH IN THE DICTIONARY OF THE ACADEMY STUDIED PUYSEGUR AND DELEUZE
AFFIRMED NOTHING NOT EVEN MIRACLES DENIED NOTHING NOT EVEN GHOSTS
TURNED OVER THE FILES OF THE MONITEUR REFLECTED
HE DECLARED THAT THE
FUTURE LIES IN THE HAND OF THE SCHOOLMASTER AND BUSIED HIMSELF WITH
EDUCATIONAL QUESTIONS
HE DESIRED THAT SOCIETY SHOULD LABOR WITHOUT
RELAXATION AT THE ELEVATION OF THE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL LEVEL AT
COINING SCIENCE AT PUTTING IDEAS INTO CIRCULATION AT INCREASING THE
MIND IN YOUTHFUL PERSONS AND HE FEARED LEST THE PRESENT POVERTY OF
METHOD THE PALTRINESS FROM A LITERARY POINT OF VIEW CONFINED TO TWO
OR THREE CENTURIES CALLED CLASSIC THE TYRANNICAL DOGMATISM OF OFFICIAL
PEDANTS SCHOLASTIC PREJUDICES AND ROUTINES SHOULD END BY CONVERTING OUR
COLLEGES INTO ARTIFICIAL OYSTER BEDS
HE WAS LEARNED A PURIST EXACT
A GRADUATE OF THE POLYTECHNIC A CLOSE STUDENT AND AT THE SAME TIME
THOUGHTFUL EVEN TO CHIMAERAS SO HIS FRIENDS SAID
HE BELIEVED IN
ALL DREAMS RAILROADS THE SUPPRESSION OF SUFFERING IN CHIRURGICAL
OPERATIONS THE FIXING OF IMAGES IN THE DARK CHAMBER THE ELECTRIC
TELEGRAPH THE STEERING OF BALLOONS
MOREOVER HE WAS NOT MUCH ALARMED
BY THE CITADELS ERECTED AGAINST THE HUMAN MIND IN EVERY DIRECTION BY
SUPERSTITION DESPOTISM AND PREJUDICE
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO THINK
THAT SCIENCE WILL EVENTUALLY TURN THE POSITION
ENJOLRAS WAS A CHIEF
COMBEFERRE WAS A GUIDE
ONE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO FIGHT UNDER THE ONE AND
TO MARCH BEHIND THE OTHER
IT IS NOT THAT COMBEFERRE WAS NOT CAPABLE OF
FIGHTING HE DID NOT REFUSE A HAND TO HAND COMBAT WITH THE OBSTACLE AND
TO ATTACK IT BY MAIN FORCE AND EXPLOSIVELY BUT IT SUITED HIM BETTER TO
BRING THE HUMAN RACE INTO ACCORD WITH ITS DESTINY GRADUALLY BY MEANS OF
EDUCATION THE INCULCATION OF AXIOMS THE PROMULGATION OF POSITIVE LAWS
AND BETWEEN TWO LIGHTS HIS PREFERENCE WAS RATHER FOR ILLUMINATION THAN
FOR CONFLAGRATION
A CONFLAGRATION CAN CREATE AN AURORA NO DOUBT BUT
WHY NOT AWAIT THE DAWN A VOLCANO ILLUMINATES BUT DAYBREAK FURNISHES A
STILL BETTER ILLUMINATION
POSSIBLY COMBEFERRE PREFERRED THE WHITENESS
OF THE BEAUTIFUL TO THE BLAZE OF THE SUBLIME
A LIGHT TROUBLED BY SMOKE
PROGRESS PURCHASED AT THE EXPENSE OF VIOLENCE ONLY HALF SATISFIED THIS
TENDER AND SERIOUS SPIRIT
THE HEADLONG PRECIPITATION OF A PEOPLE INTO
THE TRUTH A '93 TERRIFIED HIM NEVERTHELESS STAGNATION WAS STILL
MORE REPULSIVE TO HIM IN IT HE DETECTED PUTREFACTION AND DEATH ON THE
WHOLE HE PREFERRED SCUM TO MIASMA AND HE PREFERRED THE TORRENT TO THE
CESSPOOL AND THE FALLS OF NIAGARA TO THE LAKE OF MONTFAUCON
IN
SHORT HE DESIRED NEITHER HALT NOR HASTE
WHILE HIS TUMULTUOUS FRIENDS
CAPTIVATED BY THE ABSOLUTE ADORED AND INVOKED SPLENDID REVOLUTIONARY
ADVENTURES COMBEFERRE WAS INCLINED TO LET PROGRESS GOOD PROGRESS TAKE
ITS OWN COURSE HE MAY HAVE BEEN COLD BUT HE WAS PURE METHODICAL BUT
IRREPROACHABLE PHLEGMATIC BUT IMPERTURBABLE
COMBEFERRE WOULD HAVE
KNELT AND CLASPED HIS HANDS TO ENABLE THE FUTURE TO ARRIVE IN ALL
ITS CANDOR AND THAT NOTHING MIGHT DISTURB THE IMMENSE AND VIRTUOUS
EVOLUTION OF THE RACES
THE GOOD MUST BE INNOCENT HE REPEATED
INCESSANTLY
AND IN FACT IF THE GRANDEUR OF THE REVOLUTION CONSISTS
IN KEEPING THE DAZZLING IDEAL FIXEDLY IN VIEW AND OF SOARING THITHER
ATHWART THE LIGHTNINGS WITH FIRE AND BLOOD IN ITS TALONS THE BEAUTY
OF PROGRESS LIES IN BEING SPOTLESS AND THERE EXISTS BETWEEN WASHINGTON
WHO REPRESENTS THE ONE AND DANTON WHO INCARNATES THE OTHER THAT
DIFFERENCE WHICH SEPARATES THE SWAN FROM THE ANGEL WITH THE WINGS OF AN
EAGLE
JEAN PROUVAIRE WAS A STILL SOFTER SHADE THAN COMBEFERRE
HIS NAME
WAS JEHAN OWING TO THAT PETTY MOMENTARY FREAK WHICH MINGLED WITH THE
POWERFUL AND PROFOUND MOVEMENT WHENCE SPRANG THE VERY ESSENTIAL STUDY
OF THE MIDDLE AGES
JEAN PROUVAIRE WAS IN LOVE HE CULTIVATED A POT
OF FLOWERS PLAYED ON THE FLUTE MADE VERSES LOVED THE PEOPLE PITIED
WOMAN WEPT OVER THE CHILD CONFOUNDED GOD AND THE FUTURE IN THE SAME
CONFIDENCE AND BLAMED THE REVOLUTION FOR HAVING CAUSED THE FALL OF A
ROYAL HEAD THAT OF ANDRE CHENIER
HIS VOICE WAS ORDINARILY DELICATE
BUT SUDDENLY GREW MANLY
HE WAS LEARNED EVEN TO ERUDITION AND ALMOST AN
ORIENTALIST
ABOVE ALL HE WAS GOOD AND A VERY SIMPLE THING TO THOSE
WHO KNOW HOW NEARLY GOODNESS BORDERS ON GRANDEUR IN THE MATTER OF
POETRY HE PREFERRED THE IMMENSE
HE KNEW ITALIAN LATIN GREEK AND
HEBREW AND THESE SERVED HIM ONLY FOR THE PERUSAL OF FOUR POETS DANTE
JUVENAL AESCHYLUS AND ISAIAH
IN FRENCH HE PREFERRED CORNEILLE TO
RACINE AND AGRIPPA D'AUBIGNE TO CORNEILLE
HE LOVED TO SAUNTER THROUGH
FIELDS OF WILD OATS AND CORN FLOWERS AND BUSIED HIMSELF WITH CLOUDS
NEARLY AS MUCH AS WITH EVENTS
HIS MIND HAD TWO ATTITUDES ONE ON
THE SIDE TOWARDS MAN THE OTHER ON THAT TOWARDS GOD HE STUDIED OR
HE CONTEMPLATED
ALL DAY LONG HE BURIED HIMSELF IN SOCIAL QUESTIONS
SALARY CAPITAL CREDIT MARRIAGE RELIGION LIBERTY OF THOUGHT
EDUCATION PENAL SERVITUDE POVERTY ASSOCIATION PROPERTY PRODUCTION
AND SHARING THE ENIGMA OF THIS LOWER WORLD WHICH COVERS THE HUMAN
ANT HILL WITH DARKNESS AND AT NIGHT HE GAZED UPON THE PLANETS THOSE
ENORMOUS BEINGS
LIKE ENJOLRAS HE WAS WEALTHY AND AN ONLY SON
HE SPOKE
SOFTLY BOWED HIS HEAD LOWERED HIS EYES SMILED WITH EMBARRASSMENT
DRESSED BADLY HAD AN AWKWARD AIR BLUSHED AT A MERE NOTHING AND WAS
VERY TIMID
YET HE WAS INTREPID
FEUILLY WAS A WORKINGMAN A FAN MAKER ORPHANED BOTH OF FATHER AND
MOTHER WHO EARNED WITH DIFFICULTY THREE FRANCS A DAY AND HAD BUT
ONE THOUGHT TO DELIVER THE WORLD
HE HAD ONE OTHER PREOCCUPATION TO
EDUCATE HIMSELF HE CALLED THIS ALSO DELIVERING HIMSELF
HE HAD TAUGHT
HIMSELF TO READ AND WRITE EVERYTHING THAT HE KNEW HE HAD LEARNED BY
HIMSELF
FEUILLY HAD A GENEROUS HEART
THE RANGE OF HIS EMBRACE WAS
IMMENSE
THIS ORPHAN HAD ADOPTED THE PEOPLES
AS HIS MOTHER HAD
FAILED HIM HE MEDITATED ON HIS COUNTRY
HE BROODED WITH THE PROFOUND
DIVINATION OF THE MAN OF THE PEOPLE OVER WHAT WE NOW CALL THE IDEA OF
THE NATIONALITY HAD LEARNED HISTORY WITH THE EXPRESS OBJECT OF RAGING
WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE CASE
IN THIS CLUB OF YOUNG UTOPIANS
OCCUPIED CHIEFLY WITH FRANCE HE REPRESENTED THE OUTSIDE WORLD
HE HAD
FOR HIS SPECIALTY GREECE POLAND HUNGARY ROUMANIA ITALY
HE UTTERED
THESE NAMES INCESSANTLY APPROPRIATELY AND INAPPROPRIATELY WITH THE
TENACITY OF RIGHT
THE VIOLATIONS OF TURKEY ON GREECE AND THESSALY OF
RUSSIA ON WARSAW OF AUSTRIA ON VENICE ENRAGED HIM
ABOVE ALL THINGS
THE GREAT VIOLENCE OF 1772 AROUSED HIM
THERE IS NO MORE SOVEREIGN
ELOQUENCE THAN THE TRUE IN INDIGNATION HE WAS ELOQUENT WITH THAT
ELOQUENCE
HE WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE ON THAT INFAMOUS DATE OF 1772 ON THE
SUBJECT OF THAT NOBLE AND VALIANT RACE SUPPRESSED BY TREASON AND THAT
THREE SIDED CRIME ON THAT MONSTROUS AMBUSH THE PROTOTYPE AND PATTERN
OF ALL THOSE HORRIBLE SUPPRESSIONS OF STATES WHICH SINCE THAT TIME
HAVE STRUCK MANY A NOBLE NATION AND HAVE ANNULLED THEIR CERTIFICATE OF
BIRTH SO TO SPEAK
ALL CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL CRIMES HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN
THE PARTITION OF POLAND
THE PARTITION OF POLAND IS A THEOREM OF WHICH
ALL PRESENT POLITICAL OUTRAGES ARE THE COROLLARIES
THERE HAS NOT BEEN
A DESPOT NOR A TRAITOR FOR NEARLY A CENTURY BACK WHO HAS NOT SIGNED
APPROVED COUNTER SIGNED AND COPIED NE VARIATUR THE PARTITION OF
POLAND
WHEN THE RECORD OF MODERN TREASONS WAS EXAMINED THAT WAS THE
FIRST THING WHICH MADE ITS APPEARANCE
THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA CONSULTED
THAT CRIME BEFORE CONSUMMATING ITS OWN
1772 SOUNDED THE ONSET 1815
WAS THE DEATH OF THE GAME
SUCH WAS FEUILLY'S HABITUAL TEXT
THIS
POOR WORKINGMAN HAD CONSTITUTED HIMSELF THE TUTOR OF JUSTICE AND SHE
RECOMPENSED HIM BY RENDERING HIM GREAT
THE FACT IS THAT THERE IS
ETERNITY IN RIGHT
WARSAW CAN NO MORE BE TARTAR THAN VENICE CAN BE
TEUTON
KINGS LOSE THEIR PAINS AND THEIR HONOR IN THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE
THEM SO
SOONER OR LATER THE SUBMERGED PART FLOATS TO THE SURFACE AND
REAPPEARS
GREECE BECOMES GREECE AGAIN ITALY IS ONCE MORE ITALY
THE
PROTEST OF RIGHT AGAINST THE DEED PERSISTS FOREVER
THE THEFT OF A
NATION CANNOT BE ALLOWED BY PRESCRIPTION
THESE LOFTY DEEDS OF RASCALITY
HAVE NO FUTURE
A NATION CANNOT HAVE ITS MARK EXTRACTED LIKE A POCKET
HANDKERCHIEF
COURFEYRAC HAD A FATHER WHO WAS CALLED M
DE COURFEYRAC
ONE OF
THE FALSE IDEAS OF THE BOURGEOISIE UNDER THE RESTORATION AS REGARDS
ARISTOCRACY AND THE NOBILITY WAS TO BELIEVE IN THE PARTICLE
THE
PARTICLE AS EVERY ONE KNOWS POSSESSES NO SIGNIFICANCE
BUT THE
BOURGEOIS OF THE EPOCH OF LA MINERVE ESTIMATED SO HIGHLY THAT POOR DE
THAT THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES BOUND TO ABDICATE IT
M
DE CHAUVELIN
HAD HIMSELF CALLED M
CHAUVELIN M
DE CAUMARTIN M
CAUMARTIN M
DE
CONSTANT DE ROBECQUE BENJAMIN CONSTANT M
DE LAFAYETTE M
LAFAYETTE
COURFEYRAC HAD NOT WISHED TO REMAIN BEHIND THE REST AND CALLED HIMSELF
PLAIN COURFEYRAC
WE MIGHT ALMOST SO FAR AS COURFEYRAC IS CONCERNED STOP HERE
AND CONFINE OURSELVES TO SAYING WITH REGARD TO WHAT REMAINS FOR
COURFEYRAC SEE THOLOMYES
COURFEYRAC HAD IN FACT THAT ANIMATION OF YOUTH WHICH MAY BE CALLED
THE BEAUTE DU DIABLE OF THE MIND
LATER ON THIS DISAPPEARS LIKE THE
PLAYFULNESS OF THE KITTEN AND ALL THIS GRACE ENDS WITH THE BOURGEOIS
ON TWO LEGS AND WITH THE TOMCAT ON FOUR PAWS
THIS SORT OF WIT IS TRANSMITTED FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION OF THE
SUCCESSIVE LEVIES OF YOUTH WHO TRAVERSE THE SCHOOLS WHO PASS IT FROM
HAND TO HAND QUASI CURSORES AND IS ALMOST ALWAYS EXACTLY THE SAME
SO THAT AS WE HAVE JUST POINTED OUT ANY ONE WHO HAD LISTENED TO
COURFEYRAC IN 1828 WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE HEARD THOLOMYES IN 1817
ONLY
COURFEYRAC WAS AN HONORABLE FELLOW
BENEATH THE APPARENT SIMILARITIES
OF THE EXTERIOR MIND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND THOLOMYES WAS VERY
GREAT
THE LATENT MAN WHICH EXISTED IN THE TWO WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
IN THE FIRST FROM WHAT IT WAS IN THE SECOND
THERE WAS IN THOLOMYES A
DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND IN COURFEYRAC A PALADIN
ENJOLRAS WAS THE CHIEF COMBEFERRE WAS THE GUIDE COURFEYRAC WAS THE
CENTRE
THE OTHERS GAVE MORE LIGHT HE SHED MORE WARMTH THE TRUTH IS
THAT HE POSSESSED ALL THE QUALITIES OF A CENTRE ROUNDNESS AND RADIANCE
BAHOREL HAD FIGURED IN THE BLOODY TUMULT OF JUNE 1822 ON THE OCCASION
OF THE BURIAL OF YOUNG LALLEMAND
BAHOREL WAS A GOOD NATURED MORTAL WHO KEPT BAD COMPANY BRAVE A
SPENDTHRIFT PRODIGAL AND TO THE VERGE OF GENEROSITY TALKATIVE AND
AT TIMES ELOQUENT BOLD TO THE VERGE OF EFFRONTERY THE BEST FELLOW
POSSIBLE HE HAD DARING WAISTCOATS AND SCARLET OPINIONS A WHOLESALE
BLUSTERER THAT IS TO SAY LOVING NOTHING SO MUCH AS A QUARREL UNLESS
IT WERE AN UPRISING AND NOTHING SO MUCH AS AN UPRISING UNLESS IT WERE
A REVOLUTION ALWAYS READY TO SMASH A WINDOW PANE THEN TO TEAR UP THE
PAVEMENT THEN TO DEMOLISH A GOVERNMENT JUST TO SEE THE EFFECT OF IT
A STUDENT IN HIS ELEVENTH YEAR
HE HAD NOSED ABOUT THE LAW BUT DID NOT
PRACTISE IT
HE HAD TAKEN FOR HIS DEVICE NEVER A LAWYER AND FOR HIS
ARMORIAL BEARINGS A NIGHTSTAND IN WHICH WAS VISIBLE A SQUARE CAP
EVERY
TIME THAT HE PASSED THE LAW SCHOOL WHICH RARELY HAPPENED HE BUTTONED
UP HIS FROCK COAT THE PALETOT HAD NOT YET BEEN INVENTED AND TOOK
HYGIENIC PRECAUTIONS
OF THE SCHOOL PORTER HE SAID WHAT A FINE
OLD MAN AND OF THE DEAN M
DELVINCOURT WHAT A MONUMENT IN HIS
LECTURES HE ESPIED SUBJECTS FOR BALLADS AND IN HIS PROFESSORS OCCASIONS
FOR CARICATURE
HE WASTED A TOLERABLY LARGE ALLOWANCE SOMETHING LIKE
THREE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR IN DOING NOTHING
HE HAD PEASANT PARENTS WHOM HE HAD CONTRIVED TO IMBUE WITH RESPECT FOR
THEIR SON
HE SAID OF THEM THEY ARE PEASANTS AND NOT BOURGEOIS THAT IS THE
REASON THEY ARE INTELLIGENT
BAHOREL A MAN OF CAPRICE WAS SCATTERED OVER NUMEROUS CAFES THE OTHERS
HAD HABITS HE HAD NONE
HE SAUNTERED
TO STRAY IS HUMAN
TO SAUNTER
IS PARISIAN
IN REALITY HE HAD A PENETRATING MIND AND WAS MORE OF A
THINKER THAN APPEARED TO VIEW
HE SERVED AS A CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C AND
OTHER STILL UNORGANIZED GROUPS WHICH WERE DESTINED TO TAKE FORM LATER
ON
IN THIS CONCLAVE OF YOUNG HEADS THERE WAS ONE BALD MEMBER
THE MARQUIS D'AVARAY WHOM LOUIS XVIII
MADE A DUKE FOR HAVING ASSISTED
HIM TO ENTER A HACKNEY COACH ON THE DAY WHEN HE EMIGRATED WAS WONT
TO RELATE THAT IN 1814 ON HIS RETURN TO FRANCE AS THE KING WAS
DISEMBARKING AT CALAIS A MAN HANDED HIM A PETITION
WHAT IS YOUR REQUEST SAID THE KING
SIRE A POST OFFICE
WHAT IS YOUR NAME
L'AIGLE
THE KING FROWNED GLANCED AT THE SIGNATURE OF THE PETITION AND BEHELD
THE NAME WRITTEN THUS LESGLE
THIS NON BONOPARTE ORTHOGRAPHY TOUCHED
THE KING AND HE BEGAN TO SMILE
SIRE RESUMED THE MAN WITH THE
PETITION I HAD FOR ANCESTOR A KEEPER OF THE HOUNDS SURNAMED
LESGUEULES
THIS SURNAME FURNISHED MY NAME
I AM CALLED LESGUEULES BY
CONTRACTION LESGLE AND BY CORRUPTION L'AIGLE THIS CAUSED THE KING
TO SMILE BROADLY
LATER ON HE GAVE THE MAN THE POSTING OFFICE OF MEAUX
EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR ACCIDENTALLY
THE BALD MEMBER OF THE GROUP WAS THE SON OF THIS LESGLE OR LEGLE AND
HE SIGNED HIMSELF LEGLE DE MEAUX
AS AN ABBREVIATION HIS COMPANIONS
CALLED HIM BOSSUET
BOSSUET WAS A GAY BUT UNLUCKY FELLOW
HIS SPECIALTY WAS NOT TO SUCCEED
IN ANYTHING
AS AN OFFSET HE LAUGHED AT EVERYTHING
AT FIVE AND TWENTY
HE WAS BALD
HIS FATHER HAD ENDED BY OWNING A HOUSE AND A FIELD BUT
HE THE SON HAD MADE HASTE TO LOSE THAT HOUSE AND FIELD IN A BAD
SPECULATION
HE HAD NOTHING LEFT
HE POSSESSED KNOWLEDGE AND WIT BUT
ALL HE DID MISCARRIED
EVERYTHING FAILED HIM AND EVERYBODY DECEIVED HIM
WHAT HE WAS BUILDING TUMBLED DOWN ON TOP OF HIM
IF HE WERE SPLITTING
WOOD HE CUT OFF A FINGER
IF HE HAD A MISTRESS HE SPEEDILY DISCOVERED
THAT HE HAD A FRIEND ALSO
SOME MISFORTUNE HAPPENED TO HIM EVERY MOMENT
HENCE HIS JOVIALITY
HE SAID I LIVE UNDER FALLING TILES HE WAS
NOT EASILY ASTONISHED BECAUSE FOR HIM AN ACCIDENT WAS WHAT HE HAD
FORESEEN HE TOOK HIS BAD LUCK SERENELY AND SMILED AT THE TEASING OF
FATE LIKE A PERSON WHO IS LISTENING TO PLEASANTRIES
HE WAS POOR BUT
HIS FUND OF GOOD HUMOR WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE
HE SOON REACHED HIS LAST SOU
NEVER HIS LAST BURST OF LAUGHTER
WHEN ADVERSITY ENTERED HIS DOORS HE
SALUTED THIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE CORDIALLY HE TAPPED ALL CATASTROPHES ON
THE STOMACH HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH FATALITY TO THE POINT OF CALLING IT BY
ITS NICKNAME GOOD DAY GUIGNON HE SAID TO IT
THESE PERSECUTIONS OF FATE HAD RENDERED HIM INVENTIVE
HE WAS FULL OF
RESOURCES
HE HAD NO MONEY BUT HE FOUND MEANS WHEN IT SEEMED GOOD TO
HIM TO INDULGE IN UNBRIDLED EXTRAVAGANCE ONE NIGHT HE WENT SO FAR
AS TO EAT A HUNDRED FRANCS IN A SUPPER WITH A WENCH WHICH INSPIRED
HIM TO MAKE THIS MEMORABLE REMARK IN THE MIDST OF THE ORGY PULL OFF MY
BOOTS YOU FIVE LOUIS JADE
BOSSUET WAS SLOWLY DIRECTING HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE PROFESSION OF A
LAWYER HE WAS PURSUING HIS LAW STUDIES AFTER THE MANNER OF BAHOREL
BOSSUET HAD NOT MUCH DOMICILE SOMETIMES NONE AT ALL
HE LODGED NOW WITH
ONE NOW WITH ANOTHER MOST OFTEN WITH JOLY
JOLY WAS STUDYING MEDICINE
HE WAS TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN BOSSUET
JOLY WAS THE MALADE IMAGINAIRE JUNIOR
WHAT HE HAD WON IN MEDICINE WAS
TO BE MORE OF AN INVALID THAN A DOCTOR
AT THREE AND TWENTY HE THOUGHT
HIMSELF A VALETUDINARIAN AND PASSED HIS LIFE IN INSPECTING HIS TONGUE
IN THE MIRROR
HE AFFIRMED THAT MAN BECOMES MAGNETIC LIKE A NEEDLE AND
IN HIS CHAMBER HE PLACED HIS BED WITH ITS HEAD TO THE SOUTH AND THE
FOOT TO THE NORTH SO THAT AT NIGHT THE CIRCULATION OF HIS BLOOD
MIGHT NOT BE INTERFERED WITH BY THE GREAT ELECTRIC CURRENT OF THE GLOBE
DURING THUNDER STORMS HE FELT HIS PULSE
OTHERWISE HE WAS THE GAYEST
OF THEM ALL
ALL THESE YOUNG MANIACAL PUNY MERRY INCOHERENCES LIVED
IN HARMONY TOGETHER AND THE RESULT WAS AN ECCENTRIC AND AGREEABLE
BEING WHOM HIS COMRADES WHO WERE PRODIGAL OF WINGED CONSONANTS CALLED
JOLLLLY
YOU MAY FLY AWAY ON THE FOUR L'S JEAN PROUVAIRE SAID TO
HIM 23
JOLY HAD A TRICK OF TOUCHING HIS NOSE WITH THE TIP OF HIS CANE WHICH IS
AN INDICATION OF A SAGACIOUS MIND
ALL THESE YOUNG MEN WHO DIFFERED SO GREATLY AND WHO ON THE WHOLE CAN
ONLY BE DISCUSSED SERIOUSLY HELD THE SAME RELIGION PROGRESS
ALL WERE THE DIRECT SONS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
THE MOST GIDDY OF
THEM BECAME SOLEMN WHEN THEY PRONOUNCED THAT DATE '89
THEIR FATHERS IN
THE FLESH HAD BEEN EITHER ROYALISTS DOCTRINAIRES IT MATTERS NOT WHAT
THIS CONFUSION ANTERIOR TO THEMSELVES WHO WERE YOUNG DID NOT CONCERN
THEM AT ALL THE PURE BLOOD OF PRINCIPLE RAN IN THEIR VEINS
THEY
ATTACHED THEMSELVES WITHOUT INTERMEDIATE SHADES TO INCORRUPTIBLE RIGHT
AND ABSOLUTE DUTY
AFFILIATED AND INITIATED THEY SKETCHED OUT THE IDEAL UNDERGROUND
AMONG ALL THESE GLOWING HEARTS AND THOROUGHLY CONVINCED MINDS THERE WAS
ONE SCEPTIC
HOW CAME HE THERE BY JUXTAPOSITION
THIS SCEPTIC'S NAME
WAS GRANTAIRE AND HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF SIGNING HIMSELF WITH THIS
REBUS R
GRANTAIRE WAS A MAN WHO TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO BELIEVE IN
ANYTHING
MOREOVER HE WAS ONE OF THE STUDENTS WHO HAD LEARNED THE MOST
DURING THEIR COURSE AT PARIS HE KNEW THAT THE BEST COFFEE WAS TO BE HAD
AT THE CAFE LEMBLIN AND THE BEST BILLIARDS AT THE CAFE VOLTAIRE THAT
GOOD CAKES AND LASSES WERE TO BE FOUND AT THE ERMITAGE ON THE BOULEVARD
DU MAINE SPATCHCOCKED CHICKENS AT MOTHER SAUGET'S EXCELLENT MATELOTES
AT THE BARRIERE DE LA CUNETTE AND A CERTAIN THIN WHITE WINE AT THE
BARRIERE DU COM PAT
HE KNEW THE BEST PLACE FOR EVERYTHING IN
ADDITION BOXING AND FOOT FENCING AND SOME DANCES AND HE WAS A THOROUGH
SINGLE STICK PLAYER
HE WAS A TREMENDOUS DRINKER TO BOOT
HE WAS
INORDINATELY HOMELY THE PRETTIEST BOOT STITCHER OF THAT DAY IRMA
BOISSY ENRAGED WITH HIS HOMELINESS PRONOUNCED SENTENCE ON HIM AS
FOLLOWS GRANTAIRE IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT GRANTAIRE'S FATUITY WAS NOT TO
BE DISCONCERTED
HE STARED TENDERLY AND FIXEDLY AT ALL WOMEN WITH THE
AIR OF SAYING TO THEM ALL IF I ONLY CHOSE AND OF TRYING TO MAKE HIS
COMRADES BELIEVE THAT HE WAS IN GENERAL DEMAND
ALL THOSE WORDS RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE RIGHTS OF MAN THE SOCIAL
CONTRACT THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THE REPUBLIC DEMOCRACY HUMANITY
CIVILIZATION RELIGION PROGRESS CAME VERY NEAR TO SIGNIFYING NOTHING
WHATEVER TO GRANTAIRE
HE SMILED AT THEM
SCEPTICISM THAT CARIES OF THE
INTELLIGENCE HAD NOT LEFT HIM A SINGLE WHOLE IDEA
HE LIVED WITH IRONY
THIS WAS HIS AXIOM THERE IS BUT ONE CERTAINTY MY FULL GLASS HE
SNEERED AT ALL DEVOTION IN ALL PARTIES THE FATHER AS WELL AS THE
BROTHER ROBESPIERRE JUNIOR AS WELL AS LOIZEROLLES
THEY ARE GREATLY IN
ADVANCE TO BE DEAD HE EXCLAIMED
HE SAID OF THE CRUCIFIX THERE IS A
GIBBET WHICH HAS BEEN A SUCCESS A ROVER A GAMBLER A LIBERTINE
OFTEN DRUNK HE DISPLEASED THESE YOUNG DREAMERS BY HUMMING INCESSANTLY
J'AIMONS LES FILLES ET J'AIMONS LE BON VIN AIR VIVE HENRI IV
HOWEVER THIS SCEPTIC HAD ONE FANATICISM
THIS FANATICISM WAS NEITHER A
DOGMA NOR AN IDEA NOR AN ART NOR A SCIENCE IT WAS A MAN ENJOLRAS
GRANTAIRE ADMIRED LOVED AND VENERATED ENJOLRAS
TO WHOM DID THIS
ANARCHICAL SCOFFER UNITE HIMSELF IN THIS PHALANX OF ABSOLUTE MINDS TO
THE MOST ABSOLUTE
IN WHAT MANNER HAD ENJOLRAS SUBJUGATED HIM BY HIS
IDEAS NO
BY HIS CHARACTER
A PHENOMENON WHICH IS OFTEN OBSERVABLE
A SCEPTIC WHO ADHERES TO A BELIEVER IS AS SIMPLE AS THE LAW OF
COMPLEMENTARY COLORS
THAT WHICH WE LACK ATTRACTS US
NO ONE LOVES THE
LIGHT LIKE THE BLIND MAN
THE DWARF ADORES THE DRUM MAJOR
THE TOAD
ALWAYS HAS HIS EYES FIXED ON HEAVEN
WHY IN ORDER TO WATCH THE BIRD IN
ITS FLIGHT
GRANTAIRE IN WHOM WRITHED DOUBT LOVED TO WATCH FAITH
SOAR IN ENJOLRAS
HE HAD NEED OF ENJOLRAS
THAT CHASTE HEALTHY FIRM
UPRIGHT HARD CANDID NATURE CHARMED HIM WITHOUT HIS BEING CLEARLY
AWARE OF IT AND WITHOUT THE IDEA OF EXPLAINING IT TO HIMSELF HAVING
OCCURRED TO HIM
HE ADMIRED HIS OPPOSITE BY INSTINCT
HIS SOFT
YIELDING DISLOCATED SICKLY SHAPELESS IDEAS ATTACHED THEMSELVES
TO ENJOLRAS AS TO A SPINAL COLUMN
HIS MORAL BACKBONE LEANED ON THAT
FIRMNESS
GRANTAIRE IN THE PRESENCE OF ENJOLRAS BECAME SOME ONE ONCE
MORE
HE WAS HIMSELF MOREOVER COMPOSED OF TWO ELEMENTS WHICH WERE
TO ALL APPEARANCE INCOMPATIBLE
HE WAS IRONICAL AND CORDIAL
HIS
INDIFFERENCE LOVED
HIS MIND COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT BELIEF BUT HIS
HEART COULD NOT GET ALONG WITHOUT FRIENDSHIP
A PROFOUND CONTRADICTION
FOR AN AFFECTION IS A CONVICTION
HIS NATURE WAS THUS CONSTITUTED
THERE
ARE MEN WHO SEEM TO BE BORN TO BE THE REVERSE THE OBVERSE THE WRONG
SIDE
THEY ARE POLLUX PATROCLES NISUS EUDAMIDAS EPHESTION PECHMEJA
THEY ONLY EXIST ON CONDITION THAT THEY ARE BACKED UP WITH ANOTHER MAN
THEIR NAME IS A SEQUEL AND IS ONLY WRITTEN PRECEDED BY THE CONJUNCTION
AND AND THEIR EXISTENCE IS NOT THEIR OWN IT IS THE OTHER SIDE OF AN
EXISTENCE WHICH IS NOT THEIRS
GRANTAIRE WAS ONE OF THESE MEN
HE WAS
THE OBVERSE OF ENJOLRAS
ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THAT AFFINITIES BEGIN WITH THE LETTERS OF THE
ALPHABET
IN THE SERIES O AND P ARE INSEPARABLE
YOU CAN AT WILL
PRONOUNCE O AND P OR ORESTES AND PYLADES
GRANTAIRE ENJOLRAS' TRUE SATELLITE INHABITED THIS CIRCLE OF YOUNG MEN
HE LIVED THERE HE TOOK NO PLEASURE ANYWHERE BUT THERE HE FOLLOWED THEM
EVERYWHERE
HIS JOY WAS TO SEE THESE FORMS GO AND COME THROUGH THE FUMES
OF WINE
THEY TOLERATED HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS GOOD HUMOR
ENJOLRAS THE BELIEVER DISDAINED THIS SCEPTIC AND A SOBER MAN
HIMSELF SCORNED THIS DRUNKARD
HE ACCORDED HIM A LITTLE LOFTY PITY
GRANTAIRE WAS AN UNACCEPTED PYLADES
ALWAYS HARSHLY TREATED BY ENJOLRAS
ROUGHLY REPULSED REJECTED YET EVER RETURNING TO THE CHARGE HE SAID OF
ENJOLRAS WHAT FINE MARBLE
CHAPTER II BLONDEAU'S FUNERAL ORATION BY BOSSUET
ON A CERTAIN AFTERNOON WHICH HAD AS WILL BE SEEN HEREAFTER SOME
COINCIDENCE WITH THE EVENTS HERETOFORE RELATED LAIGLE DE MEAUX WAS TO
BE SEEN LEANING IN A SENSUAL MANNER AGAINST THE DOORPOST OF THE CAFE
MUSAIN
HE HAD THE AIR OF A CARYATID ON A VACATION HE CARRIED NOTHING
BUT HIS REVERY HOWEVER
HE WAS STARING AT THE PLACE SAINT MICHEL
TO LEAN ONE'S BACK AGAINST A THING IS EQUIVALENT TO LYING DOWN WHILE
STANDING ERECT WHICH ATTITUDE IS NOT HATED BY THINKERS
LAIGLE DE MEAUX
WAS PONDERING WITHOUT MELANCHOLY OVER A LITTLE MISADVENTURE WHICH
HAD BEFALLEN HIM TWO DAYS PREVIOUSLY AT THE LAW SCHOOL AND WHICH HAD
MODIFIED HIS PERSONAL PLANS FOR THE FUTURE PLANS WHICH WERE RATHER
INDISTINCT IN ANY CASE
REVERY DOES NOT PREVENT A CAB FROM PASSING BY NOR THE DREAMER FROM
TAKING NOTE OF THAT CAB
LAIGLE DE MEAUX WHOSE EYES WERE STRAYING ABOUT
IN A SORT OF DIFFUSE LOUNGING PERCEIVED ATHWART HIS SOMNAMBULISM A
TWO WHEELED VEHICLE PROCEEDING THROUGH THE PLACE AT A FOOT PACE AND
APPARENTLY IN INDECISION
FOR WHOM WAS THIS CABRIOLET WHY WAS IT
DRIVING AT A WALK LAIGLE TOOK A SURVEY
IN IT BESIDE THE COACHMAN SAT
A YOUNG MAN AND IN FRONT OF THE YOUNG MAN LAY A RATHER BULKY HAND BAG
THE BAG DISPLAYED TO PASSERS BY THE FOLLOWING NAME INSCRIBED IN LARGE
BLACK LETTERS ON A CARD WHICH WAS SEWN TO THE STUFF MARIUS PONTMERCY
THIS NAME CAUSED LAIGLE TO CHANGE HIS ATTITUDE
HE DREW HIMSELF UP AND
HURLED THIS APOSTROPHE AT THE YOUNG MAN IN THE CABRIOLET
MONSIEUR MARIUS PONTMERCY
THE CABRIOLET THUS ADDRESSED CAME TO A HALT
THE YOUNG MAN WHO ALSO SEEMED DEEPLY BURIED IN THOUGHT RAISED HIS
EYES
HEY SAID HE

MARIUS PONTMERCY
CERTAINLY
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU RESUMED LAIGLE DE MEAUX

HIS GRANDFATHER'S AND HAD BEFORE HIM A FACE WHICH HE NOW BEHELD FOR THE
FIRST TIME
I DO NOT KNOW YOU

MARIUS THOUGHT HE HAD ENCOUNTERED A WAG THE BEGINNING OF A
MYSTIFICATION IN THE OPEN STREET
HE WAS NOT IN A VERY GOOD HUMOR AT THE
MOMENT
HE FROWNED
LAIGLE DE MEAUX WENT ON IMPERTURBABLY
YOU WERE NOT AT THE SCHOOL DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
THAT IS POSSIBLE
THAT IS CERTAIN
YOU ARE A STUDENT DEMANDED MARIUS
YES SIR

DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I ENTERED THE SCHOOL BY
CHANCE

THE PROFESSOR WAS
JUST CALLING THE ROLL
YOU ARE NOT UNAWARE THAT THEY ARE VERY RIDICULOUS
ON SUCH OCCASIONS
AT THE THIRD CALL UNANSWERED YOUR NAME IS ERASED
FROM THE LIST
SIXTY FRANCS IN THE GULF
MARIUS BEGAN TO LISTEN
IT WAS BLONDEAU WHO WAS MAKING THE CALL
YOU KNOW BLONDEAU HE HAS A
VERY POINTED AND VERY MALICIOUS NOSE AND HE DELIGHTS TO SCENT OUT THE
ABSENT
HE SLYLY BEGAN WITH THE LETTER P
I WAS NOT LISTENING NOT BEING
COMPROMISED BY THAT LETTER
THE CALL WAS NOT GOING BADLY
NO ERASURES
THE UNIVERSE WAS PRESENT
BLONDEAU WAS GRIEVED
I SAID TO MYSELF
'BLONDEAU MY LOVE YOU WILL NOT GET THE VERY SMALLEST SORT OF AN
EXECUTION TO DAY ALL AT ONCE BLONDEAU CALLS 'MARIUS PONTMERCY NO
ONE ANSWERS
BLONDEAU FILLED WITH HOPE REPEATS MORE LOUDLY 'MARIUS
PONTMERCY AND HE TAKES HIS PEN
MONSIEUR I HAVE BOWELS OF COMPASSION
I SAID TO MYSELF HASTILY 'HERE'S A BRAVE FELLOW WHO IS GOING TO GET
SCRATCHED OUT
ATTENTION

HE'S NOT A GOOD STUDENT
HERE IS NONE OF YOUR HEAVY SIDES A STUDENT WHO
STUDIES A GREENHORN PEDANT STRONG ON LETTERS THEOLOGY SCIENCE AND
SAPIENCE ONE OF THOSE DULL WITS CUT BY THE SQUARE A PIN BY PROFESSION
HE IS AN HONORABLE IDLER WHO LOUNGES WHO PRACTISES COUNTRY JAUNTS WHO
CULTIVATES THE GRISETTE WHO PAYS COURT TO THE FAIR SEX WHO IS AT
THIS VERY MOMENT PERHAPS WITH MY MISTRESS
LET US SAVE HIM
DEATH TO
BLONDEAU AT THAT MOMENT BLONDEAU DIPPED HIS PEN IN ALL BLACK WITH
ERASURES IN THE INK CAST HIS YELLOW EYES ROUND THE AUDIENCE ROOM AND
REPEATED FOR THE THIRD TIME 'MARIUS PONTMERCY I REPLIED 'PRESENT
THIS IS WHY YOU WERE NOT CROSSED OFF
MONSIEUR SAID MARIUS
AND WHY I WAS ADDED LAIGLE DE MEAUX
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SAID MARIUS
LAIGLE RESUMED
NOTHING IS MORE SIMPLE
I WAS CLOSE TO THE DESK TO REPLY AND CLOSE
TO THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF FLIGHT
THE PROFESSOR GAZED AT ME WITH A
CERTAIN INTENSITY

TIGER AND SAYS TO ME 'IF YOU ARE PONTMERCY YOU ARE NOT LAIGLE A

ONLY FOR ME
THAT SAID HE CROSSED ME OFF
MARIUS EXCLAIMED

AND I SAY 'ERUDIMINI

MARIUS RESUMED
I AM VERY SORRY
YOUNG MAN SAID LAIGLE DE MEAUX LET THIS SERVE YOU AS A LESSON
IN
FUTURE BE EXACT
I REALLY BEG YOU A THOUSAND PARDONS
DO NOT EXPOSE YOUR NEIGHBOR TO THE DANGER OF HAVING HIS NAME ERASED
AGAIN
I AM EXTREMELY SORRY
LAIGLE BURST OUT LAUGHING

I WAS ON THE BRINK OF BECOMING A LAWYER
THIS
ERASURE SAVES ME

THE WIDOW AND I SHALL NOT ATTACK THE ORPHAN
NO MORE TOGA NO MORE
STAGE
HERE IS MY ERASURE ALL READY FOR ME
IT IS TO YOU THAT I AM
INDEBTED FOR IT MONSIEUR PONTMERCY
I INTEND TO PAY A SOLEMN CALL OF
THANKS UPON YOU
WHERE DO YOU LIVE
IN THIS CAB SAID MARIUS
A SIGN OF OPULENCE RETORTED LAIGLE CALMLY
I CONGRATULATE YOU
YOU
HAVE THERE A RENT OF NINE THOUSAND FRANCS PER ANNUM
AT THAT MOMENT COURFEYRAC EMERGED FROM THE CAFE
MARIUS SMILED SADLY
I HAVE PAID THIS RENT FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS AND I ASPIRE TO GET RID
OF IT BUT THERE IS A SORT OF HISTORY ATTACHED TO IT AND I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO GO
COME TO MY PLACE SIR SAID COURFEYRAC
I HAVE THE PRIORITY OBSERVED LAIGLE BUT I HAVE NO HOME
HOLD YOUR TONGUE BOSSUET SAID COURFEYRAC
BOSSUET SAID MARIUS BUT I THOUGHT THAT YOUR NAME WAS LAIGLE
DE MEAUX REPLIED LAIGLE BY METAPHOR BOSSUET
COURFEYRAC ENTERED THE CAB
COACHMAN SAID HE HOTEL DE LA PORTE SAINT JACQUES
AND THAT VERY EVENING MARIUS FOUND HIMSELF INSTALLED IN A CHAMBER OF
THE HOTEL DE LA PORTE SAINT JACQUES SIDE BY SIDE WITH COURFEYRAC
CHAPTER III MARIUS' ASTONISHMENTS
IN A FEW DAYS MARIUS HAD BECOME COURFEYRAC'S FRIEND
YOUTH IS THE
SEASON FOR PROMPT WELDING AND THE RAPID HEALING OF SCARS
MARIUS
BREATHED FREELY IN COURFEYRAC'S SOCIETY A DECIDEDLY NEW THING FOR HIM
COURFEYRAC PUT NO QUESTIONS TO HIM
HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF SUCH A
THING
AT THAT AGE FACES DISCLOSE EVERYTHING ON THE SPOT
WORDS ARE
SUPERFLUOUS
THERE ARE YOUNG MEN OF WHOM IT CAN BE SAID THAT THEIR
COUNTENANCES CHATTER
ONE LOOKS AT THEM AND ONE KNOWS THEM
ONE MORNING HOWEVER COURFEYRAC ABRUPTLY ADDRESSED THIS INTERROGATION
TO HIM
BY THE WAY HAVE YOU ANY POLITICAL OPINIONS
THE IDEA SAID MARIUS ALMOST AFFRONTED BY THE QUESTION
WHAT ARE YOU
A DEMOCRAT BONAPARTIST
THE GRAY HUE OF A REASSURED RAT SAID COURFEYRAC
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY COURFEYRAC INTRODUCED MARIUS AT THE CAFE MUSAIN
THEN HE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR WITH A SMILE I MUST GIVE YOU YOUR ENTRY
TO THE REVOLUTION AND HE LED HIM TO THE HALL OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B
C
HE PRESENTED HIM TO THE OTHER COMRADES SAYING THIS SIMPLE WORD WHICH
MARIUS DID NOT UNDERSTAND A PUPIL
MARIUS HAD FALLEN INTO A WASPS' NEST OF WITS
HOWEVER ALTHOUGH HE WAS
SILENT AND GRAVE HE WAS NONE THE LESS BOTH WINGED AND ARMED
MARIUS UP TO THAT TIME SOLITARY AND INCLINED TO SOLILOQUY AND TO
ASIDES BOTH BY HABIT AND BY TASTE WAS A LITTLE FLUTTERED BY THIS COVEY
OF YOUNG MEN AROUND HIM
ALL THESE VARIOUS INITIATIVES SOLICITED HIS
ATTENTION AT ONCE AND PULLED HIM ABOUT
THE TUMULTUOUS MOVEMENTS OF
THESE MINDS AT LIBERTY AND AT WORK SET HIS IDEAS IN A WHIRL
SOMETIMES
IN HIS TROUBLE THEY FLED SO FAR FROM HIM THAT HE HAD DIFFICULTY IN
RECOVERING THEM
HE HEARD THEM TALK OF PHILOSOPHY OF LITERATURE OF
ART OF HISTORY OF RELIGION IN UNEXPECTED FASHION
HE CAUGHT GLIMPSES
OF STRANGE ASPECTS AND AS HE DID NOT PLACE THEM IN PROPER PERSPECTIVE
HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SURE THAT IT WAS NOT CHAOS THAT HE GRASPED
ON
ABANDONING HIS GRANDFATHER'S OPINIONS FOR THE OPINIONS OF HIS FATHER
HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF FIXED HE NOW SUSPECTED WITH UNEASINESS AND
WITHOUT DARING TO AVOW IT TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT
THE ANGLE
AT WHICH HE SAW EVERYTHING BEGAN TO BE DISPLACED ANEW
A CERTAIN
OSCILLATION SET ALL THE HORIZONS OF HIS BRAINS IN MOTION
AN ODD
INTERNAL UPSETTING
HE ALMOST SUFFERED FROM IT
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO CONSECRATED THINGS FOR THOSE YOUNG
MEN
MARIUS HEARD SINGULAR PROPOSITIONS ON EVERY SORT OF SUBJECT WHICH
EMBARRASSED HIS STILL TIMID MIND
A THEATRE POSTER PRESENTED ITSELF ADORNED WITH THE TITLE OF A TRAGEDY
FROM THE ANCIENT REPERTORY CALLED CLASSIC DOWN WITH TRAGEDY DEAR TO
THE BOURGEOIS CRIED BAHOREL
AND MARIUS HEARD COMBEFERRE REPLY
YOU ARE WRONG BAHOREL
THE BOURGEOISIE LOVES TRAGEDY AND THE
BOURGEOISIE MUST BE LEFT AT PEACE ON THAT SCORE
BEWIGGED TRAGEDY HAS
A REASON FOR ITS EXISTENCE AND I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO BY ORDER OF
AESCHYLUS CONTEST ITS RIGHT TO EXISTENCE
THERE ARE ROUGH OUTLINES IN
NATURE THERE ARE IN CREATION READY MADE PARODIES A BEAK WHICH IS NOT
A BEAK WINGS WHICH ARE NOT WINGS GILLS WHICH ARE NOT GILLS PAWS WHICH
ARE NOT PAWS A CRY OF PAIN WHICH AROUSES A DESIRE TO LAUGH THERE IS
THE DUCK
NOW SINCE POULTRY EXISTS BY THE SIDE OF THE BIRD I DO
NOT SEE WHY CLASSIC TRAGEDY SHOULD NOT EXIST IN THE FACE OF ANTIQUE
TRAGEDY
OR CHANCE DECREED THAT MARIUS SHOULD TRAVERSE RUE JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU
BETWEEN ENJOLRAS AND COURFEYRAC
COURFEYRAC TOOK HIS ARM
PAY ATTENTION
THIS IS THE RUE PLATRIERE NOW CALLED RUE JEAN JACQUES
ROUSSEAU ON ACCOUNT OF A SINGULAR HOUSEHOLD WHICH LIVED IN IT SIXTY
YEARS AGO
THIS CONSISTED OF JEAN JACQUES AND THERESE
FROM TIME
TO TIME LITTLE BEINGS WERE BORN THERE
THERESE GAVE BIRTH TO THEM
JEAN JACQUES REPRESENTED THEM AS FOUNDLINGS
AND ENJOLRAS ADDRESSED COURFEYRAC ROUGHLY
SILENCE IN THE PRESENCE OF JEAN JACQUES I ADMIRE THAT MAN
HE DENIED
HIS OWN CHILDREN THAT MAY BE BUT HE ADOPTED THE PEOPLE
NOT ONE OF THESE YOUNG MEN ARTICULATED THE WORD THE EMPEROR
JEAN PROUVAIRE ALONE SOMETIMES SAID NAPOLEON ALL THE OTHERS SAID
BONAPARTE ENJOLRAS PRONOUNCED IT BUONAPARTE
MARIUS WAS VAGUELY SURPRISED
INITIUM SAPIENTIAE
CHAPTER IV THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFE MUSAIN
ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS AMONG THE YOUNG MEN AT WHICH MARIUS WAS
PRESENT AND IN WHICH HE SOMETIMES JOINED WAS A VERITABLE SHOCK TO HIS
MIND
THIS TOOK PLACE IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFE MUSAIN
NEARLY ALL THE
FRIENDS OF THE A B C HAD CONVENED THAT EVENING
THE ARGAND LAMP WAS
SOLEMNLY LIGHTED
THEY TALKED OF ONE THING AND ANOTHER WITHOUT PASSION
AND WITH NOISE
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ENJOLRAS AND MARIUS WHO HELD
THEIR PEACE ALL WERE HARANGUING RATHER AT HAP HAZARD
CONVERSATIONS
BETWEEN COMRADES SOMETIMES ARE SUBJECT TO THESE PEACEABLE TUMULTS
IT
WAS A GAME AND AN UPROAR AS MUCH AS A CONVERSATION
THEY TOSSED WORDS
TO EACH OTHER AND CAUGHT THEM UP IN TURN
THEY WERE CHATTERING IN ALL
QUARTERS
NO WOMAN WAS ADMITTED TO THIS BACK ROOM EXCEPT LOUISON THE DISH WASHER
OF THE CAFE WHO PASSED THROUGH IT FROM TIME TO TIME TO GO TO HER
WASHING IN THE LAVATORY
GRANTAIRE THOROUGHLY DRUNK WAS DEAFENING THE CORNER OF WHICH HE HAD
TAKEN POSSESSION REASONING AND CONTRADICTING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS
AND SHOUTING
I AM THIRSTY
MORTALS I AM DREAMING THAT THE TUN OF HEIDELBERG HAS AN
ATTACK OF APOPLEXY AND THAT I AM ONE OF THE DOZEN LEECHES WHICH WILL
BE APPLIED TO IT
I WANT A DRINK
I DESIRE TO FORGET LIFE
LIFE IS A
HIDEOUS INVENTION OF I KNOW NOT WHOM
IT LASTS NO TIME AT ALL AND IS
WORTH NOTHING
ONE BREAKS ONE'S NECK IN LIVING
LIFE IS A THEATRE SET IN
WHICH THERE ARE BUT FEW PRACTICABLE ENTRANCES
HAPPINESS IS AN ANTIQUE
RELIQUARY PAINTED ON ONE SIDE ONLY
ECCLESIASTES SAYS 'ALL IS VANITY
I AGREE WITH THAT GOOD MAN WHO NEVER EXISTED PERHAPS
ZERO NOT WISHING
TO GO STARK NAKED CLOTHED HIMSELF IN VANITY
O VANITY THE PATCHING UP
OF EVERYTHING WITH BIG WORDS A KITCHEN IS A LABORATORY A DANCER IS A
PROFESSOR AN ACROBAT IS A GYMNAST A BOXER IS A PUGILIST AN APOTHECARY
IS A CHEMIST A WIGMAKER IS AN ARTIST A HODMAN IS AN ARCHITECT A
JOCKEY IS A SPORTSMAN A WOOD LOUSE IS A PTERIGYBRANCHE
VANITY HAS A
RIGHT AND A WRONG SIDE THE RIGHT SIDE IS STUPID IT IS THE NEGRO WITH
HIS GLASS BEADS THE WRONG SIDE IS FOOLISH IT IS THE PHILOSOPHER WITH
HIS RAGS
I WEEP OVER THE ONE AND I LAUGH OVER THE OTHER
WHAT ARE
CALLED HONORS AND DIGNITIES AND EVEN DIGNITY AND HONOR ARE GENERALLY
OF PINCHBECK
KINGS MAKE PLAYTHINGS OF HUMAN PRIDE
CALIGULA MADE A
HORSE A CONSUL CHARLES II
MADE A KNIGHT OF A SIRLOIN
WRAP YOURSELF
UP NOW THEN BETWEEN CONSUL INCITATUS AND BARONET ROASTBEEF
AS FOR
THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF PEOPLE IT IS NO LONGER RESPECTABLE IN THE LEAST
LISTEN TO THE PANEGYRIC WHICH NEIGHBOR MAKES OF NEIGHBOR
WHITE ON WHITE
IS FEROCIOUS IF THE LILY COULD SPEAK WHAT A SETTING DOWN IT WOULD GIVE
THE DOVE A BIGOTED WOMAN PRATING OF A DEVOUT WOMAN IS MORE VENOMOUS
THAN THE ASP AND THE COBRA
IT IS A SHAME THAT I AM IGNORANT OTHERWISE
I WOULD QUOTE TO YOU A MASS OF THINGS BUT I KNOW NOTHING
FOR INSTANCE
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WITTY WHEN I WAS A PUPIL OF GROS INSTEAD OF
DAUBING WRETCHED LITTLE PICTURES I PASSED MY TIME IN PILFERING APPLES
RAPIN 24 IS THE MASCULINE OF RAPINE
SO MUCH FOR MYSELF AS FOR
THE REST OF YOU YOU ARE WORTH NO MORE THAN I AM
I SCOFF AT YOUR
PERFECTIONS EXCELLENCIES AND QUALITIES
EVERY GOOD QUALITY TENDS
TOWARDS A DEFECT ECONOMY BORDERS ON AVARICE THE GENEROUS MAN IS NEXT
DOOR TO THE PRODIGAL THE BRAVE MAN RUBS ELBOWS WITH THE BRAGGART HE
WHO SAYS VERY PIOUS SAYS A TRIFLE BIGOTED THERE ARE JUST AS MANY VICES
IN VIRTUE AS THERE ARE HOLES IN DIOGENES' CLOAK
WHOM DO YOU ADMIRE THE
SLAIN OR THE SLAYER CAESAR OR BRUTUS GENERALLY MEN ARE IN FAVOR OF THE
SLAYER
LONG LIVE BRUTUS HE HAS SLAIN THERE LIES THE VIRTUE
VIRTUE
GRANTED BUT MADNESS ALSO
THERE ARE QUEER SPOTS ON THOSE GREAT MEN
THE
BRUTUS WHO KILLED CAESAR WAS IN LOVE WITH THE STATUE OF A LITTLE BOY
THIS STATUE WAS FROM THE HAND OF THE GREEK SCULPTOR STRONGYLION
WHO ALSO CARVED THAT FIGURE OF AN AMAZON KNOWN AS THE BEAUTIFUL LEG
EUCNEMOS WHICH NERO CARRIED WITH HIM IN HIS TRAVELS
THIS STRONGYLION
LEFT BUT TWO STATUES WHICH PLACED NERO AND BRUTUS IN ACCORD
BRUTUS WAS
IN LOVE WITH THE ONE NERO WITH THE OTHER
ALL HISTORY IS NOTHING BUT
WEARISOME REPETITION
ONE CENTURY IS THE PLAGIARIST OF THE OTHER
THE
BATTLE OF MARENGO COPIES THE BATTLE OF PYDNA THE TOLBIAC OF CLOVIS AND
THE AUSTERLITZ OF NAPOLEON ARE AS LIKE EACH OTHER AS TWO DROPS OF WATER
I DON'T ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO VICTORY
NOTHING IS SO STUPID AS TO
CONQUER TRUE GLORY LIES IN CONVINCING
BUT TRY TO PROVE SOMETHING IF
YOU ARE CONTENT WITH SUCCESS WHAT MEDIOCRITY AND WITH CONQUERING WHAT
WRETCHEDNESS ALAS VANITY AND COWARDICE EVERYWHERE
EVERYTHING OBEYS
SUCCESS EVEN GRAMMAR
SI VOLET USUS SAYS HORACE
THEREFORE I DISDAIN
THE HUMAN RACE
SHALL WE DESCEND TO THE PARTY AT ALL DO YOU WISH ME
TO BEGIN ADMIRING THE PEOPLES WHAT PEOPLE IF YOU PLEASE SHALL IT BE
GREECE THE ATHENIANS THOSE PARISIANS OF DAYS GONE BY SLEW PHOCION
AS WE MIGHT SAY COLIGNY AND FAWNED UPON TYRANTS TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT
ANACEPHORUS SAID OF PISISTRATUS HIS URINE ATTRACTS THE BEES THE MOST
PROMINENT MAN IN GREECE FOR FIFTY YEARS WAS THAT GRAMMARIAN PHILETAS
WHO WAS SO SMALL AND SO THIN THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO LOAD HIS SHOES WITH
LEAD IN ORDER NOT TO BE BLOWN AWAY BY THE WIND
THERE STOOD ON THE GREAT
SQUARE IN CORINTH A STATUE CARVED BY SILANION AND CATALOGUED BY PLINY
THIS STATUE REPRESENTED EPISTHATES
WHAT DID EPISTHATES DO HE INVENTED
A TRIP
THAT SUMS UP GREECE AND GLORY
LET US PASS ON TO OTHERS
SHALL I
ADMIRE ENGLAND SHALL I ADMIRE FRANCE FRANCE WHY BECAUSE OF PARIS
I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU MY OPINION OF ATHENS
ENGLAND WHY BECAUSE OF
LONDON I HATE CARTHAGE
AND THEN LONDON THE METROPOLIS OF LUXURY IS
THE HEADQUARTERS OF WRETCHEDNESS
THERE ARE A HUNDRED DEATHS A YEAR OF
HUNGER IN THE PARISH OF CHARING CROSS ALONE
SUCH IS ALBION
I ADD
AS THE CLIMAX THAT I HAVE SEEN AN ENGLISHWOMAN DANCING IN A WREATH OF
ROSES AND BLUE SPECTACLES
A FIG THEN FOR ENGLAND IF I DO NOT ADMIRE
JOHN BULL SHALL I ADMIRE BROTHER JONATHAN I HAVE BUT LITTLE TASTE FOR
THAT SLAVE HOLDING BROTHER
TAKE AWAY TIME IS MONEY WHAT REMAINS OF
ENGLAND TAKE AWAY COTTON IS KING WHAT REMAINS OF AMERICA GERMANY IS
THE LYMPH ITALY IS THE BILE
SHALL WE GO INTO ECSTASIES OVER RUSSIA
VOLTAIRE ADMIRED IT
HE ALSO ADMIRED CHINA
I ADMIT THAT RUSSIA HAS ITS
BEAUTIES AMONG OTHERS A STOUT DESPOTISM BUT I PITY THE DESPOTS
THEIR HEALTH IS DELICATE
A DECAPITATED ALEXIS A POIGNARDED PETER
A STRANGLED PAUL ANOTHER PAUL CRUSHED FLAT WITH KICKS DIVERS IVANS
STRANGLED WITH THEIR THROATS CUT NUMEROUS NICHOLASES AND BASILS
POISONED ALL THIS INDICATES THAT THE PALACE OF THE EMPERORS OF RUSSIA
IS IN A CONDITION OF FLAGRANT INSALUBRITY
ALL CIVILIZED PEOPLES OFFER
THIS DETAIL TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE THINKER WAR NOW WAR CIVILIZED
WAR EXHAUSTS AND SUMS UP ALL THE FORMS OF RUFFIANISM FROM THE
BRIGANDAGE OF THE TRABUCEROS IN THE GORGES OF MONT JAXA TO THE MARAUDING
OF THE COMANCHE INDIANS IN THE DOUBTFUL PASS
'BAH YOU WILL SAY TO
ME 'BUT EUROPE IS CERTAINLY BETTER THAN ASIA I ADMIT THAT ASIA IS A
FARCE BUT I DO NOT PRECISELY SEE WHAT YOU FIND TO LAUGH AT IN THE GRAND
LAMA YOU PEOPLES OF THE WEST WHO HAVE MINGLED WITH YOUR FASHIONS AND
YOUR ELEGANCES ALL THE COMPLICATED FILTH OF MAJESTY FROM THE DIRTY
CHEMISE OF QUEEN ISABELLA TO THE CHAMBER CHAIR OF THE DAUPHIN
GENTLEMEN
OF THE HUMAN RACE I TELL YOU NOT A BIT OF IT IT IS AT BRUSSELS THAT
THE MOST BEER IS CONSUMED AT STOCKHOLM THE MOST BRANDY AT MADRID THE
MOST CHOCOLATE AT AMSTERDAM THE MOST GIN AT LONDON THE MOST WINE AT
CONSTANTINOPLE THE MOST COFFEE AT PARIS THE MOST ABSINTHE THERE ARE
ALL THE USEFUL NOTIONS
PARIS CARRIES THE DAY IN SHORT
IN PARIS
EVEN THE RAG PICKERS ARE SYBARITES DIOGENES WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE A
RAG PICKER OF THE PLACE MAUBERT BETTER THAN TO BE A PHILOSOPHER AT THE
PIRAEUS

THE FIRST COMER IS A WRETCH
FEMME WOMAN RHYMES WITH INFAME INFAMOUS
YES I HAVE THE SPLEEN
COMPLICATED WITH MELANCHOLY WITH HOMESICKNESS PLUS HYPOCHONDRIA AND
I AM VEXED AND I RAGE AND I YAWN AND I AM BORED AND I AM TIRED TO
DEATH AND I AM STUPID LET GOD GO TO THE DEVIL
SILENCE THEN CAPITAL R RESUMED BOSSUET WHO WAS DISCUSSING A POINT
OF LAW BEHIND THE SCENES AND WHO WAS PLUNGED MORE THAN WAIST HIGH IN A
PHRASE OF JUDICIAL SLANG OF WHICH THIS IS THE CONCLUSION
AND AS FOR ME ALTHOUGH I AM HARDLY A LEGIST AND AT THE MOST AN
AMATEUR ATTORNEY I MAINTAIN THIS THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS
OF THE CUSTOMS OF NORMANDY AT SAINT MICHEL AND FOR EACH YEAR AN
EQUIVALENT MUST BE PAID TO THE PROFIT OF THE LORD OF THE MANOR SAVING
THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS AND BY ALL AND SEVERAL THE PROPRIETORS AS WELL
AS THOSE SEIZED WITH INHERITANCE AND THAT FOR ALL EMPHYTEUSES LEASES
FREEHOLDS CONTRACTS OF DOMAIN MORTGAGES
ECHO PLAINTIVE NYMPH HUMMED GRANTAIRE
NEAR GRANTAIRE AN ALMOST SILENT TABLE A SHEET OF PAPER AN INKSTAND
AND A PEN BETWEEN TWO GLASSES OF BRANDY ANNOUNCED THAT A VAUDEVILLE WAS
BEING SKETCHED OUT
THIS GREAT AFFAIR WAS BEING DISCUSSED IN A LOW VOICE AND THE TWO HEADS
AT WORK TOUCHED EACH OTHER LET US BEGIN BY FINDING NAMES
WHEN ONE HAS
THE NAMES ONE FINDS THE SUBJECT
THAT IS TRUE
DICTATE
I WILL WRITE
MONSIEUR DORIMON
AN INDEPENDENT GENTLEMAN
OF COURSE
HIS DAUGHTER CELESTINE
TINE
WHAT NEXT
COLONEL SAINVAL
SAINVAL IS STALE
I SHOULD SAY VALSIN
BESIDE THE VAUDEVILLE ASPIRANTS ANOTHER GROUP WHICH WAS ALSO TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THE UPROAR TO TALK LOW WAS DISCUSSING A DUEL
AN OLD
FELLOW OF THIRTY WAS COUNSELLING A YOUNG ONE OF EIGHTEEN AND EXPLAINING
TO HIM WHAT SORT OF AN ADVERSARY HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
THE DEUCE LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF
HE IS A FINE SWORDSMAN
HIS PLAY IS
NEAT
HE HAS THE ATTACK NO WASTED FEINTS WRIST DASH LIGHTNING A
JUST PARADE MATHEMATICAL PARRIES BIGRE AND HE IS LEFT HANDED
IN THE ANGLE OPPOSITE GRANTAIRE JOLY AND BAHOREL WERE PLAYING DOMINOES
AND TALKING OF LOVE
YOU ARE IN LUCK THAT YOU ARE JOLY WAS SAYING
YOU HAVE A MISTRESS
WHO IS ALWAYS LAUGHING
THAT IS A FAULT OF HERS RETURNED BAHOREL
ONE'S MISTRESS DOES WRONG
TO LAUGH
THAT ENCOURAGES ONE TO DECEIVE HER
TO SEE HER GAY REMOVES
YOUR REMORSE IF YOU SEE HER SAD YOUR CONSCIENCE PRICKS YOU
INGRATE A WOMAN WHO LAUGHS IS SUCH A GOOD THING AND YOU NEVER
QUARREL
THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE TREATY WHICH WE HAVE MADE
ON FORMING OUR LITTLE
HOLY ALLIANCE WE ASSIGNED OURSELVES EACH OUR FRONTIER WHICH WE NEVER
CROSS
WHAT IS SITUATED ON THE SIDE OF WINTER BELONGS TO VAUD ON THE
SIDE OF THE WIND TO GEX
HENCE THE PEACE
PEACE IS HAPPINESS DIGESTING
AND YOU JOLLLLY WHERE DO YOU STAND IN YOUR ENTANGLEMENT WITH
MAMSELLE YOU KNOW WHOM I MEAN
SHE SULKS AT ME WITH CRUEL PATIENCE
YET YOU ARE A LOVER TO SOFTEN THE HEART WITH GAUNTNESS
ALAS
IN YOUR PLACE I WOULD LET HER ALONE
THAT IS EASY ENOUGH TO SAY
AND TO DO
IS NOT HER NAME MUSICHETTA
YES
AH MY POOR BAHOREL SHE IS A SUPERB GIRL VERY LITERARY WITH
TINY FEET LITTLE HANDS SHE DRESSES WELL AND IS WHITE AND DIMPLED
WITH THE EYES OF A FORTUNE TELLER
I AM WILD OVER HER
MY DEAR FELLOW THEN IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER YOU MUST BE ELEGANT
AND PRODUCE EFFECTS WITH YOUR KNEES
BUY A GOOD PAIR OF TROUSERS OF
DOUBLE MILLED CLOTH AT STAUB'S
THAT WILL ASSIST
AT WHAT PRICE SHOUTED GRANTAIRE
THE THIRD CORNER WAS DELIVERED UP TO A POETICAL DISCUSSION
PAGAN
MYTHOLOGY WAS GIVING BATTLE TO CHRISTIAN MYTHOLOGY
THE QUESTION WAS
ABOUT OLYMPUS WHOSE PART WAS TAKEN BY JEAN PROUVAIRE OUT OF PURE
ROMANTICISM
JEAN PROUVAIRE WAS TIMID ONLY IN REPOSE
ONCE EXCITED HE BURST FORTH
A SORT OF MIRTH ACCENTUATED HIS ENTHUSIASM AND HE WAS AT ONCE BOTH
LAUGHING AND LYRIC
LET US NOT INSULT THE GODS SAID HE
THE GODS MAY NOT HAVE TAKEN
THEIR DEPARTURE
JUPITER DOES NOT IMPRESS ME AS DEAD
THE GODS ARE
DREAMS YOU SAY
WELL EVEN IN NATURE SUCH AS IT IS TO DAY AFTER THE
FLIGHT OF THESE DREAMS WE STILL FIND ALL THE GRAND OLD PAGAN MYTHS
SUCH AND SUCH A MOUNTAIN WITH THE PROFILE OF A CITADEL LIKE THE
VIGNEMALE FOR EXAMPLE IS STILL TO ME THE HEADDRESS OF CYBELE IT HAS
NOT BEEN PROVED TO ME THAT PAN DOES NOT COME AT NIGHT TO BREATHE INTO
THE HOLLOW TRUNKS OF THE WILLOWS STOPPING UP THE HOLES IN TURN WITH HIS
FINGERS AND I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT IO HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE
CASCADE OF PISSEVACHE
IN THE LAST CORNER THEY WERE TALKING POLITICS
THE CHARTER WHICH HAD
BEEN GRANTED WAS GETTING ROUGHLY HANDLED
COMBEFERRE WAS UPHOLDING IT
WEAKLY
COURFEYRAC WAS ENERGETICALLY MAKING A BREACH IN IT
ON THE TABLE
LAY AN UNFORTUNATE COPY OF THE FAMOUS TOUQUET CHARTER
COURFEYRAC HAD
SEIZED IT AND WAS BRANDISHING IT MINGLING WITH HIS ARGUMENTS THE
RATTLING OF THIS SHEET OF PAPER
IN THE FIRST PLACE I WON'T HAVE ANY KINGS IF IT WERE ONLY FROM AN
ECONOMICAL POINT OF VIEW I DON'T WANT ANY A KING IS A PARASITE
ONE
DOES NOT HAVE KINGS GRATIS
LISTEN TO THIS THE DEARNESS OF KINGS
AT
THE DEATH OF FRANCOIS I THE NATIONAL DEBT OF FRANCE AMOUNTED TO AN
INCOME OF THIRTY THOUSAND LIVRES AT THE DEATH OF LOUIS XIV
IT WAS TWO
MILLIARDS SIX HUNDRED MILLIONS AT TWENTY EIGHT LIVRES THE MARK WHICH
WAS EQUIVALENT IN 1760 ACCORDING TO DESMARETS TO FOUR MILLIARDS FIVE
HUNDRED MILLIONS WHICH WOULD TO DAY BE EQUIVALENT TO TWELVE MILLIARDS
IN THE SECOND PLACE AND NO OFFENCE TO COMBEFERRE A CHARTER GRANTED IS
BUT A POOR EXPEDIENT OF CIVILIZATION
TO SAVE THE TRANSITION TO SOFTEN
THE PASSAGE TO DEADEN THE SHOCK TO CAUSE THE NATION TO PASS INSENSIBLY
FROM THE MONARCHY TO DEMOCRACY BY THE PRACTICE OF CONSTITUTIONAL
FICTIONS WHAT DETESTABLE REASONS ALL THOSE ARE NO NO LET US NEVER
ENLIGHTEN THE PEOPLE WITH FALSE DAYLIGHT
PRINCIPLES DWINDLE AND PALE
IN YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL CELLAR
NO ILLEGITIMACY NO COMPROMISE NO GRANT
FROM THE KING TO THE PEOPLE
IN ALL SUCH GRANTS THERE IS AN ARTICLE 14
BY THE SIDE OF THE HAND WHICH GIVES THERE IS THE CLAW WHICH SNATCHES
BACK
I REFUSE YOUR CHARTER POINT BLANK
A CHARTER IS A MASK THE LIE
LURKS BENEATH IT
A PEOPLE WHICH ACCEPTS A CHARTER ABDICATES
THE LAW IS
ONLY THE LAW WHEN ENTIRE
NO NO CHARTER
IT WAS WINTER A COUPLE OF FAGOTS WERE CRACKLING IN THE FIREPLACE
THIS
WAS TEMPTING AND COURFEYRAC COULD NOT RESIST
HE CRUMPLED THE POOR
TOUQUET CHARTER IN HIS FIST AND FLUNG IT IN THE FIRE
THE PAPER
FLASHED UP
COMBEFERRE WATCHED THE MASTERPIECE OF LOUIS XVIII
BURN
PHILOSOPHICALLY AND CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING
THE CHARTER METAMORPHOSED INTO FLAME
AND SARCASMS SALLIES JESTS THAT FRENCH THING WHICH IS CALLED ENTRAIN
AND THAT ENGLISH THING WHICH IS CALLED HUMOR GOOD AND BAD TASTE
GOOD AND BAD REASONS ALL THE WILD PYROTECHNICS OF DIALOGUE MOUNTING
TOGETHER AND CROSSING FROM ALL POINTS OF THE ROOM PRODUCED A SORT OF
MERRY BOMBARDMENT OVER THEIR HEADS
CHAPTER V ENLARGEMENT OF HORIZON
THE SHOCKS OF YOUTHFUL MINDS AMONG THEMSELVES HAVE THIS ADMIRABLE
PROPERTY THAT ONE CAN NEVER FORESEE THE SPARK NOR DIVINE THE LIGHTNING
FLASH
WHAT WILL DART OUT PRESENTLY NO ONE KNOWS
THE BURST OF LAUGHTER
STARTS FROM A TENDER FEELING
AT THE MOMENT OF JEST THE SERIOUS MAKES ITS ENTRY
IMPULSES DEPEND ON
THE FIRST CHANCE WORD
THE SPIRIT OF EACH IS SOVEREIGN JEST SUFFICES
TO OPEN THE FIELD TO THE UNEXPECTED
THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS WITH
ABRUPT TURNS IN WHICH THE PERSPECTIVE CHANGES SUDDENLY
CHANCE IS THE
STAGE MANAGER OF SUCH CONVERSATIONS
A SEVERE THOUGHT STARTING ODDLY FROM A CLASH OF WORDS SUDDENLY
TRAVERSED THE CONFLICT OF QUIPS IN WHICH GRANTAIRE BAHOREL PROUVAIRE
BOSSUET COMBEFERRE AND COURFEYRAC WERE CONFUSEDLY FENCING
HOW DOES A PHRASE CROP UP IN A DIALOGUE WHENCE COMES IT THAT IT
SUDDENLY IMPRESSES ITSELF ON THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO HEAR IT WE
HAVE JUST SAID THAT NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT IT
IN THE MIDST OF THE
UPROAR BOSSUET ALL AT ONCE TERMINATED SOME APOSTROPHE TO COMBEFERRE
WITH THIS DATE
JUNE 18TH 1815 WATERLOO
AT THIS NAME OF WATERLOO MARIUS WHO WAS LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON A TABLE
BESIDE A GLASS OF WATER REMOVED HIS WRIST FROM BENEATH HIS CHIN AND
BEGAN TO GAZE FIXEDLY AT THE AUDIENCE
PARDIEU EXCLAIMED COURFEYRAC PARBLEU WAS FALLING INTO DISUSE
AT THIS PERIOD THAT NUMBER 18 IS STRANGE AND STRIKES ME
IT IS
BONAPARTE'S FATAL NUMBER
PLACE LOUIS IN FRONT AND BRUMAIRE BEHIND YOU
HAVE THE WHOLE DESTINY OF THE MAN WITH THIS SIGNIFICANT PECULIARITY
THAT THE END TREADS CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF THE COMMENCEMENT
ENJOLRAS WHO HAD REMAINED MUTE UP TO THAT POINT BROKE THE SILENCE AND
ADDRESSED THIS REMARK TO COMBEFERRE
YOU MEAN TO SAY THE CRIME AND THE EXPIATION
THIS WORD CRIME OVERPASSED THE MEASURE OF WHAT MARIUS WHO WAS ALREADY
GREATLY AGITATED BY THE ABRUPT EVOCATION OF WATERLOO COULD ACCEPT
HE ROSE WALKED SLOWLY TO THE MAP OF FRANCE SPREAD OUT ON THE WALL AND
AT WHOSE BASE AN ISLAND WAS VISIBLE IN A SEPARATE COMPARTMENT LAID HIS
FINGER ON THIS COMPARTMENT AND SAID
CORSICA A LITTLE ISLAND WHICH HAS RENDERED FRANCE VERY GREAT
THIS WAS LIKE A BREATH OF ICY AIR
ALL CEASED TALKING
THEY FELT THAT
SOMETHING WAS ON THE POINT OF OCCURRING
BAHOREL REPLYING TO BOSSUET WAS JUST ASSUMING AN ATTITUDE OF THE TORSO
TO WHICH HE WAS ADDICTED
HE GAVE IT UP TO LISTEN
ENJOLRAS WHOSE BLUE EYE WAS NOT FIXED ON ANY ONE AND WHO SEEMED TO BE
GAZING AT SPACE REPLIED WITHOUT GLANCING AT MARIUS
FRANCE NEEDS NO CORSICA TO BE GREAT
FRANCE IS GREAT BECAUSE SHE IS
FRANCE
QUIA NOMINA LEO
MARIUS FELT NO DESIRE TO RETREAT HE TURNED TOWARDS ENJOLRAS AND HIS
VOICE BURST FORTH WITH A VIBRATION WHICH CAME FROM A QUIVER OF HIS VERY
BEING
GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD DIMINISH FRANCE BUT AMALGAMATING NAPOLEON
WITH HER IS NOT DIMINISHING HER
COME LET US ARGUE THE QUESTION
I AM
A NEW COMER AMONG YOU BUT I WILL CONFESS THAT YOU AMAZE ME
WHERE DO WE
STAND WHO ARE WE WHO ARE YOU WHO AM I LET US COME TO AN EXPLANATION
ABOUT THE EMPEROR
I HEAR YOU SAY BUONAPARTE ACCENTING THE U LIKE THE
ROYALISTS
I WARN YOU THAT MY GRANDFATHER DOES BETTER STILL HE
SAYS BUONAPARTE'
I THOUGHT YOU WERE YOUNG MEN
WHERE THEN IS YOUR
ENTHUSIASM AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH IT WHOM DO YOU ADMIRE IF YOU
DO NOT ADMIRE THE EMPEROR AND WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT IF YOU WILL
HAVE NONE OF THAT GREAT MAN WHAT GREAT MEN WOULD YOU LIKE HE HAD
EVERYTHING
HE WAS COMPLETE
HE HAD IN HIS BRAIN THE SUM OF HUMAN
FACULTIES
HE MADE CODES LIKE JUSTINIAN HE DICTATED LIKE CAESAR HIS
CONVERSATION WAS MINGLED WITH THE LIGHTNING FLASH OF PASCAL WITH THE
THUNDERCLAP OF TACITUS HE MADE HISTORY AND HE WROTE IT HIS BULLETINS
ARE ILIADS HE COMBINED THE CIPHER OF NEWTON WITH THE METAPHOR OF
MAHOMET HE LEFT BEHIND HIM IN THE EAST WORDS AS GREAT AS THE PYRAMIDS
AT TILSIT HE TAUGHT EMPERORS MAJESTY AT THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES HE
REPLIED TO LAPLACE IN THE COUNCIL OF STATE BE HELD HIS OWN AGAINST
MERLIN HE GAVE A SOUL TO THE GEOMETRY OF THE FIRST AND TO THE
CHICANERY OF THE LAST HE WAS A LEGIST WITH THE ATTORNEYS AND SIDEREAL
WITH THE ASTRONOMERS LIKE CROMWELL BLOWING OUT ONE OF TWO CANDLES HE
WENT TO THE TEMPLE TO BARGAIN FOR A CURTAIN TASSEL HE SAW EVERYTHING
HE KNEW EVERYTHING WHICH DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM LAUGHING
GOOD NATUREDLY BESIDE THE CRADLE OF HIS LITTLE CHILD AND ALL AT ONCE
FRIGHTENED EUROPE LENT AN EAR ARMIES PUT THEMSELVES IN MOTION PARKS OF
ARTILLERY RUMBLED PONTOONS STRETCHED OVER THE RIVERS CLOUDS OF CAVALRY
GALLOPED IN THE STORM CRIES TRUMPETS A TREMBLING OF THRONES IN EVERY
DIRECTION THE FRONTIERS OF KINGDOMS OSCILLATED ON THE MAP THE SOUND
OF A SUPERHUMAN SWORD WAS HEARD AS IT WAS DRAWN FROM ITS SHEATH THEY
BEHELD HIM HIM RISE ERECT ON THE HORIZON WITH A BLAZING BRAND IN HIS
HAND AND A GLOW IN HIS EYES UNFOLDING AMID THE THUNDER HIS TWO WINGS
THE GRAND ARMY AND THE OLD GUARD AND HE WAS THE ARCHANGEL OF WAR
ALL HELD THEIR PEACE AND ENJOLRAS BOWED HIS HEAD
SILENCE ALWAYS
PRODUCES SOMEWHAT THE EFFECT OF ACQUIESCENCE OF THE ENEMY BEING DRIVEN
TO THE WALL
MARIUS CONTINUED WITH INCREASED ENTHUSIASM AND ALMOST
WITHOUT PAUSING FOR BREATH
LET US BE JUST MY FRIENDS WHAT A SPLENDID DESTINY FOR A NATION TO BE
THE EMPIRE OF SUCH AN EMPEROR WHEN THAT NATION IS FRANCE AND WHEN IT
ADDS ITS OWN GENIUS TO THE GENIUS OF THAT MAN TO APPEAR AND TO REIGN
TO MARCH AND TO TRIUMPH TO HAVE FOR HALTING PLACES ALL CAPITALS TO
TAKE HIS GRENADIERS AND TO MAKE KINGS OF THEM TO DECREE THE FALLS OF
DYNASTIES AND TO TRANSFIGURE EUROPE AT THE PACE OF A CHARGE TO MAKE
YOU FEEL THAT WHEN YOU THREATEN YOU LAY YOUR HAND ON THE HILT OF THE
SWORD OF GOD TO FOLLOW IN A SINGLE MAN HANNIBAL CAESAR CHARLEMAGNE
TO BE THE PEOPLE OF SOME ONE WHO MINGLES WITH YOUR DAWNS THE STARTLING
ANNOUNCEMENT OF A BATTLE WON TO HAVE THE CANNON OF THE INVALIDES TO
ROUSE YOU IN THE MORNING TO HURL INTO ABYSSES OF LIGHT PRODIGIOUS WORDS
WHICH FLAME FOREVER MARENGO ARCOLA AUSTERLITZ JENA WAGRAM TO CAUSE
CONSTELLATIONS OF VICTORIES TO FLASH FORTH AT EACH INSTANT FROM THE
ZENITH OF THE CENTURIES TO MAKE THE FRENCH EMPIRE A PENDANT TO THE
ROMAN EMPIRE TO BE THE GREAT NATION AND TO GIVE BIRTH TO THE GRAND
ARMY TO MAKE ITS LEGIONS FLY FORTH OVER ALL THE EARTH AS A MOUNTAIN
SENDS OUT ITS EAGLES ON ALL SIDES TO CONQUER TO DOMINATE TO STRIKE
WITH LIGHTNING TO BE IN EUROPE A SORT OF NATION GILDED THROUGH GLORY
TO SOUND ATHWART THE CENTURIES A TRUMPET BLAST OF TITANS TO CONQUER
THE WORLD TWICE BY CONQUEST AND BY DAZZLING THAT IS SUBLIME AND WHAT
GREATER THING IS THERE
TO BE FREE SAID COMBEFERRE
MARIUS LOWERED HIS HEAD IN HIS TURN THAT COLD AND SIMPLE WORD HAD
TRAVERSED HIS EPIC EFFUSION LIKE A BLADE OF STEEL AND HE FELT IT
VANISHING WITHIN HIM
WHEN HE RAISED HIS EYES COMBEFERRE WAS NO LONGER
THERE
PROBABLY SATISFIED WITH HIS REPLY TO THE APOTHEOSIS HE HAD
JUST TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE AND ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ENJOLRAS
HAD FOLLOWED HIM
THE ROOM HAD BEEN EMPTIED
ENJOLRAS LEFT ALONE WITH
MARIUS WAS GAZING GRAVELY AT HIM
MARIUS HOWEVER HAVING RALLIED HIS
IDEAS TO SOME EXTENT DID NOT CONSIDER HIMSELF BEATEN THERE LINGERED IN
HIM A TRACE OF INWARD FERMENTATION WHICH WAS ON THE POINT NO DOUBT OF
TRANSLATING ITSELF INTO SYLLOGISMS ARRAYED AGAINST ENJOLRAS WHEN ALL OF
A SUDDEN THEY HEARD SOME ONE SINGING ON THE STAIRS AS HE WENT
IT WAS
COMBEFERRE AND THIS IS WHAT HE WAS SINGING
SI CESAR M'AVAIT DONNE 25
LA GLOIRE ET LA GUERRE
ET QU'IL ME FALLAIT QUITTER
L'AMOUR DE MA MERE
JE DIRAIS AU GRAND CESAR
REPRENDS TON SCEPTRE ET TON CHAR
J'AIME MIEUX MA MERE O GUE
J'AIME MIEUX MA MERE
THE WILD AND TENDER ACCENTS WITH WHICH COMBEFERRE SANG COMMUNICATED TO
THIS COUPLET A SORT OF STRANGE GRANDEUR
MARIUS THOUGHTFULLY AND
WITH HIS EYES DIKED ON THE CEILING REPEATED ALMOST MECHANICALLY MY
MOTHER
AT THAT MOMENT HE FELT ENJOLRAS' HAND ON HIS SHOULDER
CITIZEN SAID ENJOLRAS TO HIM MY MOTHER IS THE REPUBLIC
CHAPTER VI RES ANGUSTA
THAT EVENING LEFT MARIUS PROFOUNDLY SHAKEN AND WITH A MELANCHOLY SHADOW
IN HIS SOUL
HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT
WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED
WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY
OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
MARIUS WAS GLOOMY
HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT
IT ALREADY HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT
HE DECLARED TO
HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF
HIMSELF
TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE
NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS
INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
MARIUS
WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT
PAINED HIM
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS
HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO
ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
WHITHER WOULD THIS LEAD
HIM HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM
NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM
THAT FATHER
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH
OCCURRED TO HIM
AN ESCARPMENT ROSE AROUND HIM
HE WAS IN ACCORD NEITHER
WITH HIS GRANDFATHER NOR WITH HIS FRIENDS DARING IN THE EYES OF
THE ONE HE WAS BEHIND THE TIMES IN THE EYES OF THE OTHERS AND HE
RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT HE WAS DOUBLY ISOLATED ON THE SIDE OF AGE AND
ON THE SIDE OF YOUTH
HE CEASED TO GO TO THE CAFE MUSAIN
IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF
CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
THE REALITIES OF LIFE DO NOT ALLOW
THEMSELVES TO BE FORGOTTEN
THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
ONE MORNING THE PROPRIETOR OF THE HOTEL ENTERED MARIUS' ROOM AND SAID
TO HIM
MONSIEUR COURFEYRAC ANSWERED FOR YOU
YES
BUT I MUST HAVE MY MONEY
REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
COURFEYRAC HAVING MADE HIS APPEARANCE THE HOST LEFT THEM
MARIUS THEN
TOLD HIM WHAT IT HAD NOT BEFORE OCCURRED TO HIM TO RELATE THAT HE WAS
THE SAME AS ALONE IN THE WORLD AND HAD NO RELATIVES
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC
I DO NOT KNOW IN THE LEAST REPLIED MARIUS
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
I DO NOT KNOW
HAVE YOU ANY MONEY
FIFTEEN FRANCS
DO YOU WANT ME TO LEND YOU SOME
NEVER
HAVE YOU CLOTHES
HERE IS WHAT I HAVE
HAVE YOU TRINKETS
A WATCH
SILVER
GOLD HERE IT IS
I KNOW A CLOTHES DEALER WHO WILL TAKE YOUR FROCK COAT AND A PAIR OF
TROUSERS
THAT IS GOOD
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A
COAT
AND MY BOOTS
WHAT YOU WILL NOT GO BAREFOOT WHAT OPULENCE
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
I KNOW A WATCHMAKER WHO WILL BUY YOUR WATCH
THAT IS GOOD
NO IT IS NOT GOOD
WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
WHATEVER IS NECESSARY
ANYTHING HONEST THAT IS TO SAY
DO YOU KNOW ENGLISH
NO
DO YOU KNOW GERMAN
NO
SO MUCH THE WORSE
WHY
BECAUSE ONE OF MY FRIENDS A PUBLISHER IS GETTING UP A SORT OF AN
ENCYCLOPAEDIA FOR WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE TRANSLATED ENGLISH OR GERMAN
ARTICLES
IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
I WILL LEARN ENGLISH AND GERMAN
AND IN THE MEANWHILE
IN THE MEANWHILE I WILL LIVE ON MY CLOTHES AND MY WATCH
THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR
HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF
GARMENTS
THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR
FORTY FIVE FRANCS
THAT IS NOT BAD SAID MARIUS TO COURFEYRAC ON THEIR RETURN TO THE
HOTEL WITH MY FIFTEEN FRANCS THAT MAKES EIGHTY
AND THE HOTEL BILL OBSERVED COURFEYRAC
HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
IT
AMOUNTED TO SEVENTY FRANCS
I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
THE DEUCE EXCLAIMED COURFEYRAC YOU WILL EAT UP FIVE FRANCS WHILE
YOU ARE LEARNING ENGLISH AND FIVE WHILE LEARNING GERMAN
THAT WILL BE
SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
IN THE MEANTIME AUNT GILLENORMAND A RATHER GOOD HEARTED PERSON AT
BOTTOM IN DIFFICULTIES HAD FINALLY HUNTED UP MARIUS' ABODE
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER
FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED
FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER
IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT
HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
AT THAT MOMENT
HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
HIS AUNT DID NOT INFORM HIS GRANDFATHER OF THIS REFUSAL FOR FEAR OF
EXASPERATING HIM
BESIDES HAD HE NOT SAID LET ME NEVER HEAR THE NAME
OF THAT BLOOD DRINKER AGAIN
MARIUS LEFT THE HOTEL DE LA PORTE SAINT JACQUES AS HE DID NOT WISH TO
RUN IN DEBT THERE
BOOK FIFTH THE EXCELLENCE OF MISFORTUNE
CHAPTER I MARIUS INDIGENT
ILLUSTRATION EXCELLENCE OF MISFORTUNE 3B5 1 MISFORTUNE
LIFE BECAME HARD FOR MARIUS
IT WAS NOTHING TO EAT HIS CLOTHES AND HIS
WATCH
HE ATE OF THAT TERRIBLE INEXPRESSIBLE THING THAT IS CALLED DE LA
VACHE ENRAGE THAT IS TO SAY HE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIPS AND PRIVATIONS
A TERRIBLE THING IT IS CONTAINING DAYS WITHOUT BREAD NIGHTS WITHOUT
SLEEP EVENINGS WITHOUT A CANDLE A HEARTH WITHOUT A FIRE WEEKS WITHOUT
WORK A FUTURE WITHOUT HOPE A COAT OUT AT THE ELBOWS AN OLD HAT WHICH
EVOKES THE LAUGHTER OF YOUNG GIRLS A DOOR WHICH ONE FINDS LOCKED ON ONE
AT NIGHT BECAUSE ONE'S RENT IS NOT PAID THE INSOLENCE OF THE PORTER
AND THE COOK SHOP MAN THE SNEERS OF NEIGHBORS HUMILIATIONS DIGNITY
TRAMPLED ON WORK OF WHATEVER NATURE ACCEPTED DISGUSTS BITTERNESS
DESPONDENCY
MARIUS LEARNED HOW ALL THIS IS EATEN AND HOW SUCH ARE
OFTEN THE ONLY THINGS WHICH ONE HAS TO DEVOUR
AT THAT MOMENT OF HIS
EXISTENCE WHEN A MAN NEEDS HIS PRIDE BECAUSE HE NEEDS LOVE HE FELT
THAT HE WAS JEERED AT BECAUSE HE WAS BADLY DRESSED AND RIDICULOUS
BECAUSE HE WAS POOR
AT THE AGE WHEN YOUTH SWELLS THE HEART WITH
IMPERIAL PRIDE HE DROPPED HIS EYES MORE THAN ONCE ON HIS DILAPIDATED
BOOTS AND HE KNEW THE UNJUST SHAME AND THE POIGNANT BLUSHES OF
WRETCHEDNESS
ADMIRABLE AND TERRIBLE TRIAL FROM WHICH THE FEEBLE EMERGE
BASE FROM WHICH THE STRONG EMERGE SUBLIME
A CRUCIBLE INTO WHICH
DESTINY CASTS A MAN WHENEVER IT DESIRES A SCOUNDREL OR A DEMI GOD
FOR MANY GREAT DEEDS ARE PERFORMED IN PETTY COMBATS
THERE ARE INSTANCES
OF BRAVERY IGNORED AND OBSTINATE WHICH DEFEND THEMSELVES STEP BY
STEP IN THAT FATAL ONSLAUGHT OF NECESSITIES AND TURPITUDES
NOBLE AND
MYSTERIOUS TRIUMPHS WHICH NO EYE BEHOLDS WHICH ARE REQUITED WITH NO
RENOWN WHICH ARE SALUTED WITH NO TRUMPET BLAST
LIFE MISFORTUNE
ISOLATION ABANDONMENT POVERTY ARE THE FIELDS OF BATTLE WHICH HAVE
THEIR HEROES OBSCURE HEROES WHO ARE SOMETIMES GRANDER THAN THE
HEROES WHO WIN RENOWN
FIRM AND RARE NATURES ARE THUS CREATED MISERY ALMOST ALWAYS A
STEP MOTHER IS SOMETIMES A MOTHER DESTITUTION GIVES BIRTH TO MIGHT OF
SOUL AND SPIRIT DISTRESS IS THE NURSE OF PRIDE UNHAPPINESS IS A GOOD
MILK FOR THE MAGNANIMOUS
THERE CAME A MOMENT IN MARIUS' LIFE WHEN HE SWEPT HIS OWN LANDING WHEN
HE BOUGHT HIS SOU'S WORTH OF BRIE CHEESE AT THE FRUITERER'S WHEN HE
WAITED UNTIL TWILIGHT HAD FALLEN TO SLIP INTO THE BAKER'S AND PURCHASE
A LOAF WHICH HE CARRIED OFF FURTIVELY TO HIS ATTIC AS THOUGH HE HAD
STOLEN IT
SOMETIMES THERE COULD BE SEEN GLIDING INTO THE BUTCHER'S SHOP
ON THE CORNER IN THE MIDST OF THE BANTERING COOKS WHO ELBOWED HIM AN
AWKWARD YOUNG MAN CARRYING BIG BOOKS UNDER HIS ARM WHO HAD A TIMID YET
ANGRY AIR WHO ON ENTERING REMOVED HIS HAT FROM A BROW WHEREON STOOD
DROPS OF PERSPIRATION MADE A PROFOUND BOW TO THE BUTCHER'S ASTONISHED
WIFE ASKED FOR A MUTTON CUTLET PAID SIX OR SEVEN SOUS FOR IT WRAPPED
IT UP IN A PAPER PUT IT UNDER HIS ARM BETWEEN TWO BOOKS AND WENT
AWAY
IT WAS MARIUS
ON THIS CUTLET WHICH HE COOKED FOR HIMSELF HE
LIVED FOR THREE DAYS
ON THE FIRST DAY HE ATE THE MEAT ON THE SECOND HE ATE THE FAT ON THE
THIRD HE GNAWED THE BONE
AUNT GILLENORMAND MADE REPEATED ATTEMPTS AND
SENT HIM THE SIXTY PISTOLES SEVERAL TIMES
MARIUS RETURNED THEM ON EVERY
OCCASION SAYING THAT HE NEEDED NOTHING
HE WAS STILL IN MOURNING FOR HIS FATHER WHEN THE REVOLUTION WHICH WE
HAVE JUST DESCRIBED WAS EFFECTED WITHIN HIM
FROM THAT TIME FORTH HE
HAD NOT PUT OFF HIS BLACK GARMENTS
BUT HIS GARMENTS WERE QUITTING HIM
THE DAY CAME WHEN HE HAD NO LONGER A COAT
THE TROUSERS WOULD GO NEXT
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE COURFEYRAC TO WHOM HE HAD ON HIS SIDE DONE SOME
GOOD TURNS GAVE HIM AN OLD COAT
FOR THIRTY SOUS MARIUS GOT IT TURNED
BY SOME PORTER OR OTHER AND IT WAS A NEW COAT
BUT THIS COAT WAS GREEN
THEN MARIUS CEASED TO GO OUT UNTIL AFTER NIGHTFALL
THIS MADE HIS COAT
BLACK
AS HE WISHED ALWAYS TO APPEAR IN MOURNING HE CLOTHED HIMSELF
WITH THE NIGHT
IN SPITE OF ALL THIS HE GOT ADMITTED TO PRACTICE AS A LAWYER
HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO LIVE IN COURFEYRAC'S ROOM WHICH WAS DECENT AND WHERE
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF LAW BOOKS BACKED UP AND COMPLETED BY SEVERAL
DILAPIDATED VOLUMES OF ROMANCE PASSED AS THE LIBRARY REQUIRED BY THE
REGULATIONS
HE HAD HIS LETTERS ADDRESSED TO COURFEYRAC'S QUARTERS
WHEN MARIUS BECAME A LAWYER HE INFORMED HIS GRANDFATHER OF THE FACT
IN A LETTER WHICH WAS COLD BUT FULL OF SUBMISSION AND RESPECT
M
GILLENORMAND TREMBLED AS HE TOOK THE LETTER READ IT TORE IT IN FOUR
PIECES AND THREW IT INTO THE WASTE BASKET
TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND HEARD HER FATHER WHO WAS ALONE IN HIS ROOM
TALKING ALOUD TO HIMSELF
HE ALWAYS DID THIS WHENEVER HE WAS GREATLY
AGITATED
SHE LISTENED AND THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING IF YOU WERE NOT A
FOOL YOU WOULD KNOW THAT ONE CANNOT BE A BARON AND A LAWYER AT THE SAME
TIME
CHAPTER II MARIUS POOR
IT IS THE SAME WITH WRETCHEDNESS AS WITH EVERYTHING ELSE
IT ENDS BY
BECOMING BEARABLE
IT FINALLY ASSUMES A FORM AND ADJUSTS ITSELF
ONE
VEGETATES THAT IS TO SAY ONE DEVELOPS IN A CERTAIN MEAGRE FASHION
WHICH IS HOWEVER SUFFICIENT FOR LIFE
THIS IS THE MODE IN WHICH THE
EXISTENCE OF MARIUS PONTMERCY WAS ARRANGED
HE HAD PASSED THE WORST STRAITS THE NARROW PASS WAS OPENING OUT A
LITTLE IN FRONT OF HIM
BY DINT OF TOIL PERSEVERANCE COURAGE AND
WILL HE HAD MANAGED TO DRAW FROM HIS WORK ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FRANCS A
YEAR
HE HAD LEARNED GERMAN AND ENGLISH THANKS TO COURFEYRAC WHO HAD
PUT HIM IN COMMUNICATION WITH HIS FRIEND THE PUBLISHER MARIUS FILLED
THE MODEST POST OF UTILITY MAN IN THE LITERATURE OF THE PUBLISHING
HOUSE
HE DREW UP PROSPECTUSES TRANSLATED NEWSPAPERS ANNOTATED
EDITIONS COMPILED BIOGRAPHIES ETC NET PRODUCT YEAR IN AND YEAR
OUT SEVEN HUNDRED FRANCS
HE LIVED ON IT
HOW NOT SO BADLY
WE WILL
EXPLAIN
MARIUS OCCUPIED IN THE GORBEAU HOUSE FOR AN ANNUAL SUM OF THIRTY
FRANCS A DEN MINUS A FIREPLACE CALLED A CABINET WHICH CONTAINED ONLY
THE MOST INDISPENSABLE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE
THIS FURNITURE BELONGED
TO HIM
HE GAVE THREE FRANCS A MONTH TO THE OLD PRINCIPAL TENANT TO COME
AND SWEEP HIS HOLE AND TO BRING HIM A LITTLE HOT WATER EVERY MORNING
A FRESH EGG AND A PENNY ROLL
HE BREAKFASTED ON THIS EGG AND ROLL
HIS
BREAKFAST VARIED IN COST FROM TWO TO FOUR SOUS ACCORDING AS EGGS
WERE DEAR OR CHEAP
AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING HE DESCENDED THE
RUE SAINT JACQUES TO DINE AT ROUSSEAU'S OPPOSITE BASSET'S THE
STAMP DEALER'S ON THE CORNER OF THE RUE DES MATHURINS
HE ATE NO SOUP
HE TOOK A SIX SOU PLATE OF MEAT A HALF PORTION OF VEGETABLES FOR THREE
SOUS AND A THREE SOU DESSERT
FOR THREE SOUS HE GOT AS MUCH BREAD AS
HE WISHED
AS FOR WINE HE DRANK WATER
WHEN HE PAID AT THE DESK
WHERE MADAM ROUSSEAU AT THAT PERIOD STILL PLUMP AND ROSY MAJESTICALLY
PRESIDED HE GAVE A SOU TO THE WAITER AND MADAM ROUSSEAU GAVE HIM A
SMILE
THEN HE WENT AWAY
FOR SIXTEEN SOUS HE HAD A SMILE AND A DINNER
THIS RESTAURANT ROUSSEAU WHERE SO FEW BOTTLES AND SO MANY WATER CARAFES
WERE EMPTIED WAS A CALMING POTION RATHER THAN A RESTAURANT
IT NO
LONGER EXISTS
THE PROPRIETOR HAD A FINE NICKNAME HE WAS CALLED
ROUSSEAU THE AQUATIC
THUS BREAKFAST FOUR SOUS DINNER SIXTEEN SOUS HIS FOOD COST HIM TWENTY
SOUS A DAY WHICH MADE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE FRANCS A YEAR
ADD
THE THIRTY FRANCS FOR RENT AND THE THIRTY SIX FRANCS TO THE OLD WOMAN
PLUS A FEW TRIFLING EXPENSES FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FRANCS MARIUS
WAS FED LODGED AND WAITED ON
HIS CLOTHING COST HIM A HUNDRED FRANCS
HIS LINEN FIFTY FRANCS HIS WASHING FIFTY FRANCS THE WHOLE DID NOT
EXCEED SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FRANCS
HE WAS RICH
HE SOMETIMES LENT TEN
FRANCS TO A FRIEND
COURFEYRAC HAD ONCE BEEN ABLE TO BORROW SIXTY FRANCS
OF HIM
AS FAR AS FIRE WAS CONCERNED AS MARIUS HAD NO FIREPLACE HE HAD
SIMPLIFIED MATTERS
MARIUS ALWAYS HAD TWO COMPLETE SUITS OF CLOTHES THE ONE OLD FOR EVERY
DAY THE OTHER BRAND NEW FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS
BOTH WERE BLACK
HE
HAD BUT THREE SHIRTS ONE ON HIS PERSON THE SECOND IN THE COMMODE AND
THE THIRD IN THE WASHERWOMAN'S HANDS
HE RENEWED THEM AS THEY WORE OUT
THEY WERE ALWAYS RAGGED WHICH CAUSED HIM TO BUTTON HIS COAT TO THE
CHIN
IT HAD REQUIRED YEARS FOR MARIUS TO ATTAIN TO THIS FLOURISHING
CONDITION
HARD YEARS DIFFICULT SOME OF THEM TO TRAVERSE OTHERS TO
CLIMB
MARIUS HAD NOT FAILED FOR A SINGLE DAY
HE HAD ENDURED EVERYTHING
IN THE WAY OF DESTITUTION HE HAD DONE EVERYTHING EXCEPT CONTRACT DEBTS
HE DID HIMSELF THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT HE HAD NEVER OWED ANY ONE A SOU
A DEBT WAS TO HIM THE BEGINNING OF SLAVERY
HE EVEN SAID TO HIMSELF
THAT A CREDITOR IS WORSE THAN A MASTER FOR THE MASTER POSSESSES ONLY
YOUR PERSON A CREDITOR POSSESSES YOUR DIGNITY AND CAN ADMINISTER TO
IT A BOX ON THE EAR
RATHER THAN BORROW HE WENT WITHOUT FOOD
HE HAD
PASSED MANY A DAY FASTING
FEELING THAT ALL EXTREMES MEET AND THAT
IF ONE IS NOT ON ONE'S GUARD LOWERED FORTUNES MAY LEAD TO BASENESS OF
SOUL HE KEPT A JEALOUS WATCH ON HIS PRIDE
SUCH AND SUCH A FORMALITY
OR ACTION WHICH IN ANY OTHER SITUATION WOULD HAVE APPEARED MERELY A
DEFERENCE TO HIM NOW SEEMED INSIPIDITY AND HE NERVED HIMSELF AGAINST
IT
HIS FACE WORE A SORT OF SEVERE FLUSH
HE WAS TIMID EVEN TO RUDENESS
DURING ALL THESE TRIALS HE HAD FELT HIMSELF ENCOURAGED AND EVEN
UPLIFTED AT TIMES BY A SECRET FORCE THAT HE POSSESSED WITHIN HIMSELF
THE SOUL AIDS THE BODY AND AT CERTAIN MOMENTS RAISES IT
IT IS THE
ONLY BIRD WHICH BEARS UP ITS OWN CAGE
BESIDES HIS FATHER'S NAME ANOTHER NAME WAS GRAVEN IN MARIUS' HEART
THE NAME OF THENARDIER
MARIUS WITH HIS GRAVE AND ENTHUSIASTIC NATURE
SURROUNDED WITH A SORT OF AUREOLE THE MAN TO WHOM IN HIS THOUGHTS
HE OWED HIS FATHER'S LIFE THAT INTREPID SERGEANT WHO HAD SAVED THE
COLONEL AMID THE BULLETS AND THE CANNON BALLS OF WATERLOO
HE NEVER
SEPARATED THE MEMORY OF THIS MAN FROM THE MEMORY OF HIS FATHER AND
HE ASSOCIATED THEM IN HIS VENERATION
IT WAS A SORT OF WORSHIP IN TWO
STEPS WITH THE GRAND ALTAR FOR THE COLONEL AND THE LESSER ONE FOR
THENARDIER
WHAT REDOUBLED THE TENDERNESS OF HIS GRATITUDE TOWARDS
THENARDIER WAS THE IDEA OF THE DISTRESS INTO WHICH HE KNEW THAT
THENARDIER HAD FALLEN AND WHICH HAD ENGULFED THE LATTER
MARIUS HAD
LEARNED AT MONTFERMEIL OF THE RUIN AND BANKRUPTCY OF THE UNFORTUNATE
INN KEEPER
SINCE THAT TIME HE HAD MADE UNHEARD OF EFFORTS TO FIND
TRACES OF HIM AND TO REACH HIM IN THAT DARK ABYSS OF MISERY IN WHICH
THENARDIER HAD DISAPPEARED
MARIUS HAD BEATEN THE WHOLE COUNTRY HE
HAD GONE TO CHELLES TO BONDY TO GOURNEY TO NOGENT TO LAGNY
HE HAD
PERSISTED FOR THREE YEARS EXPENDING IN THESE EXPLORATIONS THE LITTLE
MONEY WHICH HE HAD LAID BY
NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GIVE HIM ANY NEWS OF
THENARDIER HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE GONE ABROAD
HIS CREDITORS HAD ALSO
SOUGHT HIM WITH LESS LOVE THAN MARIUS BUT WITH AS MUCH ASSIDUITY AND
HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO LAY THEIR HANDS ON HIM
MARIUS BLAMED HIMSELF AND
WAS ALMOST ANGRY WITH HIMSELF FOR HIS LACK OF SUCCESS IN HIS RESEARCHES
IT WAS THE ONLY DEBT LEFT HIM BY THE COLONEL AND MARIUS MADE IT A
MATTER OF HONOR TO PAY IT
WHAT HE THOUGHT WHEN MY FATHER LAY DYING
ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE DID THENARDIER CONTRIVE TO FIND HIM AMID THE
SMOKE AND THE GRAPE SHOT AND BEAR HIM OFF ON HIS SHOULDERS AND YET HE
OWED HIM NOTHING AND I WHO OWE SO MUCH TO THENARDIER CANNOT JOIN HIM
IN THIS SHADOW WHERE HE IS LYING IN THE PANGS OF DEATH AND IN MY
TURN BRING HIM BACK FROM DEATH TO LIFE OH I WILL FIND HIM TO FIND
THENARDIER IN FACT MARIUS WOULD HAVE GIVEN ONE OF HIS ARMS TO RESCUE
HIM FROM HIS MISERY HE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED ALL HIS BLOOD
TO SEE
THENARDIER TO RENDER THENARDIER SOME SERVICE TO SAY TO HIM YOU DO
NOT KNOW ME WELL I DO KNOW YOU HERE I AM
DISPOSE OF ME THIS WAS
MARIUS' SWEETEST AND MOST MAGNIFICENT DREAM
CHAPTER III MARIUS GROWN UP
AT THIS EPOCH MARIUS WAS TWENTY YEARS OF AGE
IT WAS THREE YEARS SINCE
HE HAD LEFT HIS GRANDFATHER
BOTH PARTIES HAD REMAINED ON THE SAME
TERMS WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO APPROACH EACH OTHER AND WITHOUT SEEKING TO
SEE EACH OTHER
BESIDES WHAT WAS THE USE OF SEEING EACH OTHER MARIUS
WAS THE BRASS VASE WHILE FATHER GILLENORMAND WAS THE IRON POT
WE ADMIT THAT MARIUS WAS MISTAKEN AS TO HIS GRANDFATHER'S HEART
HE HAD
IMAGINED THAT M
GILLENORMAND HAD NEVER LOVED HIM AND THAT THAT CRUSTY
HARSH AND SMILING OLD FELLOW WHO CURSED SHOUTED AND STORMED
AND BRANDISHED HIS CANE CHERISHED FOR HIM AT THE MOST ONLY THAT
AFFECTION WHICH IS AT ONCE SLIGHT AND SEVERE OF THE DOTARDS OF COMEDY
MARIUS WAS IN ERROR
THERE ARE FATHERS WHO DO NOT LOVE THEIR CHILDREN
THERE EXISTS NO GRANDFATHER WHO DOES NOT ADORE HIS GRANDSON
AT BOTTOM
AS WE HAVE SAID M
GILLENORMAND IDOLIZED MARIUS
HE IDOLIZED HIM AFTER
HIS OWN FASHION WITH AN ACCOMPANIMENT OF SNAPPISHNESS AND BOXES ON THE
EAR BUT THIS CHILD ONCE GONE HE FELT A BLACK VOID IN HIS HEART
HE WOULD ALLOW NO ONE TO MENTION THE CHILD TO HIM AND ALL THE WHILE
SECRETLY REGRETTED THAT HE WAS SO WELL OBEYED
AT FIRST HE HOPED THAT
THIS BUONAPARTIST THIS JACOBIN THIS TERRORIST THIS SEPTEMBRIST WOULD
RETURN
BUT THE WEEKS PASSED BY YEARS PASSED TO M
GILLENORMAND'S
GREAT DESPAIR THE BLOOD DRINKER DID NOT MAKE HIS APPEARANCE
I COULD
NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN TURN HIM OUT SAID THE GRANDFATHER TO HIMSELF
AND HE ASKED HIMSELF IF THE THING WERE TO DO OVER AGAIN WOULD I DO
IT HIS PRIDE INSTANTLY ANSWERED YES BUT HIS AGED HEAD WHICH HE
SHOOK IN SILENCE REPLIED SADLY NO HE HAD HIS HOURS OF DEPRESSION
HE MISSED MARIUS
OLD MEN NEED AFFECTION AS THEY NEED THE SUN
IT IS
WARMTH
STRONG AS HIS NATURE WAS THE ABSENCE OF MARIUS HAD WROUGHT SOME
CHANGE IN HIM
NOTHING IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO TAKE A
STEP TOWARDS THAT ROGUE BUT HE SUFFERED
HE NEVER INQUIRED ABOUT HIM
BUT HE THOUGHT OF HIM INCESSANTLY
HE LIVED IN THE MARAIS IN A MORE AND
MORE RETIRED MANNER HE WAS STILL MERRY AND VIOLENT AS OF OLD BUT
HIS MERRIMENT HAD A CONVULSIVE HARSHNESS AND HIS VIOLENCES ALWAYS
TERMINATED IN A SORT OF GENTLE AND GLOOMY DEJECTION
HE SOMETIMES SAID
OH IF HE ONLY WOULD RETURN WHAT A GOOD BOX ON THE EAR I WOULD GIVE
HIM
AS FOR HIS AUNT SHE THOUGHT TOO LITTLE TO LOVE MUCH MARIUS WAS NO
LONGER FOR HER MUCH MORE THAN A VAGUE BLACK FORM AND SHE EVENTUALLY
CAME TO OCCUPY HERSELF WITH HIM MUCH LESS THAN WITH THE CAT OR THE
PAROQUET WHICH SHE PROBABLY HAD
WHAT AUGMENTED FATHER GILLENORMAND'S
SECRET SUFFERING WAS THAT HE LOCKED IT ALL UP WITHIN HIS BREAST AND
DID NOT ALLOW ITS EXISTENCE TO BE DIVINED
HIS SORROW WAS LIKE THOSE
RECENTLY INVENTED FURNACES WHICH CONSUME THEIR OWN SMOKE
IT SOMETIMES
HAPPENED THAT OFFICIOUS BUSYBODIES SPOKE TO HIM OF MARIUS AND ASKED
HIM WHAT IS YOUR GRANDSON DOING WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM THE OLD
BOURGEOIS REPLIED WITH A SIGH THAT HE WAS A SAD CASE AND GIVING A
FILLIP TO HIS CUFF IF HE WISHED TO APPEAR GAY MONSIEUR LE BARON DE
PONTMERCY IS PRACTISING PETTIFOGGING IN SOME CORNER OR OTHER
WHILE THE OLD MAN REGRETTED MARIUS APPLAUDED HIMSELF
AS IS THE CASE
WITH ALL GOOD HEARTED PEOPLE MISFORTUNE HAD ERADICATED HIS BITTERNESS
HE ONLY THOUGHT OF M
GILLENORMAND IN AN AMIABLE LIGHT BUT HE HAD SET
HIS MIND ON NOT RECEIVING ANYTHING MORE FROM THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN
UNKIND TO HIS FATHER
THIS WAS THE MITIGATED TRANSLATION OF HIS FIRST
INDIGNATION
MOREOVER HE WAS HAPPY AT HAVING SUFFERED AND AT SUFFERING
STILL
IT WAS FOR HIS FATHER'S SAKE
THE HARDNESS OF HIS LIFE SATISFIED
AND PLEASED HIM
HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH A SORT OF JOY THAT IT WAS
CERTAINLY THE LEAST HE COULD DO THAT IT WAS AN EXPIATION THAT HAD
IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PUNISHED IN SOME OTHER WAY AND
LATER ON FOR HIS IMPIOUS INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS HIS FATHER AND SUCH A
FATHER THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN JUST THAT HIS FATHER SHOULD HAVE ALL
THE SUFFERING AND HE NONE OF IT AND THAT IN ANY CASE WHAT WERE HIS
TOILS AND HIS DESTITUTION COMPARED WITH THE COLONEL'S HEROIC LIFE THAT
IN SHORT THE ONLY WAY FOR HIM TO APPROACH HIS FATHER AND RESEMBLE HIM
WAS TO BE BRAVE IN THE FACE OF INDIGENCE AS THE OTHER HAD BEEN VALIANT
BEFORE THE ENEMY AND THAT THAT WAS NO DOUBT WHAT THE COLONEL HAD
MEANT TO IMPLY BY THE WORDS HE WILL BE WORTHY OF IT WORDS WHICH
MARIUS CONTINUED TO WEAR NOT ON HIS BREAST SINCE THE COLONEL'S WRITING
HAD DISAPPEARED BUT IN HIS HEART
AND THEN ON THE DAY WHEN HIS GRANDFATHER HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF DOORS
HE HAD BEEN ONLY A CHILD NOW HE WAS A MAN
HE FELT IT
MISERY WE
REPEAT HAD BEEN GOOD FOR HIM
POVERTY IN YOUTH WHEN IT SUCCEEDS HAS
THIS MAGNIFICENT PROPERTY ABOUT IT THAT IT TURNS THE WHOLE WILL TOWARDS
EFFORT AND THE WHOLE SOUL TOWARDS ASPIRATION
POVERTY INSTANTLY LAYS
MATERIAL LIFE BARE AND RENDERS IT HIDEOUS HENCE INEXPRESSIBLE BOUNDS
TOWARDS THE IDEAL LIFE
THE WEALTHY YOUNG MAN HAS A HUNDRED COARSE AND
BRILLIANT DISTRACTIONS HORSE RACES HUNTING DOGS TOBACCO GAMING
GOOD REPASTS AND ALL THE REST OF IT OCCUPATIONS FOR THE BASER SIDE
OF THE SOUL AT THE EXPENSE OF THE LOFTIER AND MORE DELICATE SIDES
THE POOR YOUNG MAN WINS HIS BREAD WITH DIFFICULTY HE EATS WHEN HE HAS
EATEN HE HAS NOTHING MORE BUT MEDITATION
HE GOES TO THE SPECTACLES
WHICH GOD FURNISHES GRATIS HE GAZES AT THE SKY SPACE THE STARS
FLOWERS CHILDREN THE HUMANITY AMONG WHICH HE IS SUFFERING THE
CREATION AMID WHICH HE BEAMS
HE GAZES SO MUCH ON HUMANITY THAT HE
PERCEIVES ITS SOUL HE GAZES UPON CREATION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE
BEHOLDS GOD
HE DREAMS HE FEELS HIMSELF GREAT HE DREAMS ON AND FEELS
HIMSELF TENDER
FROM THE EGOTISM OF THE MAN WHO SUFFERS HE PASSES TO THE
COMPASSION OF THE MAN WHO MEDITATES
AN ADMIRABLE SENTIMENT BREAKS FORTH
IN HIM FORGETFULNESS OF SELF AND PITY FOR ALL
AS HE THINKS OF THE
INNUMERABLE ENJOYMENTS WHICH NATURE OFFERS GIVES AND LAVISHES TO SOULS
WHICH STAND OPEN AND REFUSES TO SOULS THAT ARE CLOSED HE COMES TO
PITY HE THE MILLIONNAIRE OF THE MIND THE MILLIONNAIRE OF MONEY
ALL
HATRED DEPARTS FROM HIS HEART IN PROPORTION AS LIGHT PENETRATES HIS
SPIRIT
AND IS HE UNHAPPY NO
THE MISERY OF A YOUNG MAN IS NEVER
MISERABLE
THE FIRST YOUNG LAD WHO COMES TO HAND HOWEVER POOR HE MAY
BE WITH HIS STRENGTH HIS HEALTH HIS RAPID WALK HIS BRILLIANT EYES
HIS WARMLY CIRCULATING BLOOD HIS BLACK HAIR HIS RED LIPS HIS WHITE
TEETH HIS PURE BREATH WILL ALWAYS AROUSE THE ENVY OF AN AGED EMPEROR
AND THEN EVERY MORNING HE SETS HIMSELF AFRESH TO THE TASK OF EARNING
HIS BREAD AND WHILE HIS HANDS EARN HIS BREAD HIS DORSAL COLUMN
GAINS PRIDE HIS BRAIN GATHERS IDEAS
HIS TASK FINISHED HE RETURNS TO
INEFFABLE ECSTASIES TO CONTEMPLATION TO JOYS HE BEHOLDS HIS FEET SET
IN AFFLICTIONS IN OBSTACLES ON THE PAVEMENT IN THE NETTLES SOMETIMES
IN THE MIRE HIS HEAD IN THE LIGHT
HE IS FIRM SERENE GENTLE PEACEFUL
ATTENTIVE SERIOUS CONTENT WITH LITTLE KINDLY AND HE THANKS GOD FOR
HAVING BESTOWED ON HIM THOSE TWO FORMS OF RICHES WHICH MANY A RICH
MAN LACKS WORK WHICH MAKES HIM FREE AND THOUGHT WHICH MAKES HIM
DIGNIFIED
THIS IS WHAT HAD HAPPENED WITH MARIUS
TO TELL THE TRUTH HE INCLINED A
LITTLE TOO MUCH TO THE SIDE OF CONTEMPLATION
FROM THE DAY WHEN HE HAD
SUCCEEDED IN EARNING HIS LIVING WITH SOME APPROACH TO CERTAINTY HE HAD
STOPPED THINKING IT GOOD TO BE POOR AND RETRENCHING TIME FROM HIS WORK
TO GIVE TO THOUGHT THAT IS TO SAY HE SOMETIMES PASSED ENTIRE DAYS
IN MEDITATION ABSORBED ENGULFED LIKE A VISIONARY IN THE MUTE
VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF ECSTASY AND INWARD RADIANCE
HE HAD THUS PROPOUNDED
THE PROBLEM OF HIS LIFE TO TOIL AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AT MATERIAL
LABOR IN ORDER TO TOIL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AT THE LABOR WHICH IS
IMPALPABLE IN OTHER WORDS TO BESTOW A FEW HOURS ON REAL LIFE AND TO
CAST THE REST TO THE INFINITE
AS HE BELIEVED THAT HE LACKED NOTHING HE
DID NOT PERCEIVE THAT CONTEMPLATION THUS UNDERSTOOD ENDS BY BECOMING
ONE OF THE FORMS OF IDLENESS THAT HE WAS CONTENTING HIMSELF WITH
CONQUERING THE FIRST NECESSITIES OF LIFE AND THAT HE WAS RESTING FROM
HIS LABORS TOO SOON
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT FOR THIS ENERGETIC AND ENTHUSIASTIC NATURE THIS
COULD ONLY BE A TRANSITORY STATE AND THAT AT THE FIRST SHOCK AGAINST
THE INEVITABLE COMPLICATIONS OF DESTINY MARIUS WOULD AWAKEN
IN THE MEANTIME ALTHOUGH HE WAS A LAWYER AND WHATEVER FATHER
GILLENORMAND THOUGHT ABOUT THE MATTER HE WAS NOT PRACTISING HE WAS
NOT EVEN PETTIFOGGING
MEDITATION HAD TURNED HIM ASIDE FROM PLEADING
TO
HAUNT ATTORNEYS TO FOLLOW THE COURT TO HUNT UP CASES WHAT A BORE WHY
SHOULD HE DO IT HE SAW NO REASON FOR CHANGING THE MANNER OF GAINING HIS
LIVELIHOOD THE OBSCURE AND ILL PAID PUBLISHING ESTABLISHMENT HAD COME
TO MEAN FOR HIM A SURE SOURCE OF WORK WHICH DID NOT INVOLVE TOO MUCH
LABOR AS WE HAVE EXPLAINED AND WHICH SUFFICED FOR HIS WANTS
ONE OF THE PUBLISHERS FOR WHOM HE WORKED M
MAGIMEL I THINK OFFERED
TO TAKE HIM INTO HIS OWN HOUSE TO LODGE HIM WELL TO FURNISH HIM WITH
REGULAR OCCUPATION AND TO GIVE HIM FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS A YEAR
TO BE
WELL LODGED FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS NO DOUBT
BUT RENOUNCE HIS LIBERTY
BE ON FIXED WAGES A SORT OF HIRED MAN OF LETTERS ACCORDING TO MARIUS'
OPINION IF HE ACCEPTED HIS POSITION WOULD BECOME BOTH BETTER AND WORSE
AT THE SAME TIME HE ACQUIRED COMFORT AND LOST HIS DIGNITY IT WAS A
FINE AND COMPLETE UNHAPPINESS CONVERTED INTO A REPULSIVE AND RIDICULOUS
STATE OF TORTURE SOMETHING LIKE THE CASE OF A BLIND MAN WHO SHOULD
RECOVER THE SIGHT OF ONE EYE
HE REFUSED
MARIUS DWELT IN SOLITUDE
OWING TO HIS TASTE FOR REMAINING OUTSIDE OF
EVERYTHING AND THROUGH HAVING BEEN TOO MUCH ALARMED HE HAD NOT ENTERED
DECIDEDLY INTO THE GROUP PRESIDED OVER BY ENJOLRAS
THEY HAD REMAINED
GOOD FRIENDS THEY WERE READY TO ASSIST EACH OTHER ON OCCASION IN EVERY
POSSIBLE WAY BUT NOTHING MORE
MARIUS HAD TWO FRIENDS ONE YOUNG
COURFEYRAC AND ONE OLD M
MABEUF
HE INCLINED MORE TO THE OLD MAN
IN THE FIRST PLACE HE OWED TO HIM THE REVOLUTION WHICH HAD TAKEN
PLACE WITHIN HIM TO HIM HE WAS INDEBTED FOR HAVING KNOWN AND LOVED HIS
FATHER
HE OPERATED ON ME FOR A CATARACT HE SAID
THE CHURCHWARDEN HAD CERTAINLY PLAYED A DECISIVE PART
IT WAS NOT HOWEVER THAT M
MABEUF HAD BEEN ANYTHING BUT THE CALM AND
IMPASSIVE AGENT OF PROVIDENCE IN THIS CONNECTION
HE HAD ENLIGHTENED
MARIUS BY CHANCE AND WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF THE FACT AS DOES A CANDLE
WHICH SOME ONE BRINGS HE HAD BEEN THE CANDLE AND NOT THE SOME ONE
AS FOR MARIUS' INWARD POLITICAL REVOLUTION M
MABEUF WAS TOTALLY
INCAPABLE OF COMPREHENDING IT OF WILLING OR OF DIRECTING IT
AS WE SHALL SEE M
MABEUF AGAIN LATER ON A FEW WORDS WILL NOT BE
SUPERFLUOUS
CHAPTER IV M
MABEUF
ON THE DAY WHEN M
MABEUF SAID TO MARIUS CERTAINLY I APPROVE OF
POLITICAL OPINIONS HE EXPRESSED THE REAL STATE OF HIS MIND
ALL
POLITICAL OPINIONS WERE MATTERS OF INDIFFERENCE TO HIM AND HE APPROVED
THEM ALL WITHOUT DISTINCTION PROVIDED THEY LEFT HIM IN PEACE AS THE
GREEKS CALLED THE FURIES THE BEAUTIFUL THE GOOD THE CHARMING THE
EUMENIDES
M
MABEUF'S POLITICAL OPINION CONSISTED IN A PASSIONATE LOVE
FOR PLANTS AND ABOVE ALL FOR BOOKS
LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD
HE POSSESSED THE TERMINATION IN IST WITHOUT WHICH NO ONE COULD EXIST AT
THAT TIME BUT HE WAS NEITHER A ROYALIST A BONAPARTIST A CHARTIST
AN ORLEANIST NOR AN ANARCHIST HE WAS A BOUQUINIST A COLLECTOR OF OLD
BOOKS
HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MEN COULD BUSY THEMSELVES WITH
HATING EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF SILLY STUFF LIKE THE CHARTER DEMOCRACY
LEGITIMACY MONARCHY THE REPUBLIC ETC WHEN THERE WERE IN THE WORLD
ALL SORTS OF MOSSES GRASSES AND SHRUBS WHICH THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING AT
AND HEAPS OF FOLIOS AND EVEN OF 32MOS WHICH THEY MIGHT TURN OVER
HE
TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO BECOME USELESS HAVING BOOKS DID NOT PREVENT HIS
READING BEING A BOTANIST DID NOT PREVENT HIS BEING A GARDENER
WHEN
HE MADE PONTMERCY'S ACQUAINTANCE THIS SYMPATHY HAD EXISTED BETWEEN THE
COLONEL AND HIMSELF THAT WHAT THE COLONEL DID FOR FLOWERS HE DID FOR
FRUITS
M
MABEUF HAD SUCCEEDED IN PRODUCING SEEDLING PEARS AS SAVORY
AS THE PEARS OF ST
GERMAIN IT IS FROM ONE OF HIS COMBINATIONS
APPARENTLY THAT THE OCTOBER MIRABELLE NOW CELEBRATED AND NO LESS
PERFUMED THAN THE SUMMER MIRABELLE OWES ITS ORIGIN
HE WENT TO MASS
RATHER FROM GENTLENESS THAN FROM PIETY AND BECAUSE AS HE LOVED THE
FACES OF MEN BUT HATED THEIR NOISE HE FOUND THEM ASSEMBLED AND SILENT
ONLY IN CHURCH
FEELING THAT HE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE STATE HE HAD
CHOSEN THE CAREER OF WARDEN
HOWEVER HE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN LOVING
ANY WOMAN AS MUCH AS A TULIP BULB NOR ANY MAN AS MUCH AS AN ELZEVIR
HE HAD LONG PASSED SIXTY WHEN ONE DAY SOME ONE ASKED HIM HAVE YOU
NEVER BEEN MARRIED I HAVE FORGOTTEN SAID HE
WHEN IT SOMETIMES
HAPPENED TO HIM AND TO WHOM DOES IT NOT HAPPEN TO SAY OH IF I WERE
ONLY RICH IT WAS NOT WHEN OGLING A PRETTY GIRL AS WAS THE CASE WITH
FATHER GILLENORMAND BUT WHEN CONTEMPLATING AN OLD BOOK
HE LIVED ALONE
WITH AN OLD HOUSEKEEPER
HE WAS SOMEWHAT GOUTY AND WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP
HIS AGED FINGERS STIFFENED WITH RHEUMATISM LAY CROOKED UP IN THE FOLDS
OF HIS SHEETS
HE HAD COMPOSED AND PUBLISHED A FLORA OF THE ENVIRONS OF
CAUTERETZ WITH COLORED PLATES A WORK WHICH ENJOYED A TOLERABLE
MEASURE OF ESTEEM AND WHICH SOLD WELL
PEOPLE RANG HIS BELL IN THE RUE
MESIERES TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY TO ASK FOR IT
HE DREW AS MUCH AS
TWO THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR FROM IT THIS CONSTITUTED NEARLY THE WHOLE OF
HIS FORTUNE
ALTHOUGH POOR HE HAD HAD THE TALENT TO FORM FOR HIMSELF
BY DINT OF PATIENCE PRIVATIONS AND TIME A PRECIOUS COLLECTION OF RARE
COPIES OF EVERY SORT
HE NEVER WENT OUT WITHOUT A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM
AND HE OFTEN RETURNED WITH TWO
THE SOLE DECORATION OF THE FOUR ROOMS
ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH COMPOSED HIS LODGINGS CONSISTED OF FRAMED
HERBARIUMS AND ENGRAVINGS OF THE OLD MASTERS
THE SIGHT OF A SWORD OR
A GUN CHILLED HIS BLOOD
HE HAD NEVER APPROACHED A CANNON IN HIS LIFE
EVEN AT THE INVALIDES
HE HAD A PASSABLE STOMACH A BROTHER WHO WAS A
CURE PERFECTLY WHITE HAIR NO TEETH EITHER IN HIS MOUTH OR HIS MIND A
TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB A PICARD ACCENT AN INFANTILE LAUGH THE AIR OF
AN OLD SHEEP AND HE WAS EASILY FRIGHTENED
ADD TO THIS THAT HE HAD NO
OTHER FRIENDSHIP NO OTHER ACQUAINTANCE AMONG THE LIVING THAN AN OLD
BOOKSELLER OF THE PORTE SAINT JACQUES NAMED ROYAL
HIS DREAM WAS TO
NATURALIZE INDIGO IN FRANCE
HIS SERVANT WAS ALSO A SORT OF INNOCENT
THE POOR GOOD OLD WOMAN WAS A
SPINSTER
SULTAN HER CAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE MEWED ALLEGRI'S MISERERE IN
THE SIXTINE CHAPEL HAD FILLED HER HEART AND SUFFICED FOR THE QUANTITY
OF PASSION WHICH EXISTED IN HER
NONE OF HER DREAMS HAD EVER PROCEEDED
AS FAR AS MAN
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET FURTHER THAN HER CAT
LIKE
HIM SHE HAD A MUSTACHE
HER GLORY CONSISTED IN HER CAPS WHICH WERE
ALWAYS WHITE
SHE PASSED HER TIME ON SUNDAYS AFTER MASS IN COUNTING
OVER THE LINEN IN HER CHEST AND IN SPREADING OUT ON HER BED THE DRESSES
IN THE PIECE WHICH SHE BOUGHT AND NEVER HAD MADE UP
SHE KNEW HOW TO
READ
M
MABEUF HAD NICKNAMED HER MOTHER PLUTARQUE
M
MABEUF HAD TAKEN A FANCY TO MARIUS BECAUSE MARIUS BEING YOUNG AND
GENTLE WARMED HIS AGE WITHOUT STARTLING HIS TIMIDITY
YOUTH COMBINED
WITH GENTLENESS PRODUCES ON OLD PEOPLE THE EFFECT OF THE SUN WITHOUT
WIND
WHEN MARIUS WAS SATURATED WITH MILITARY GLORY WITH GUNPOWDER
WITH MARCHES AND COUNTERMARCHES AND WITH ALL THOSE PRODIGIOUS BATTLES
IN WHICH HIS FATHER HAD GIVEN AND RECEIVED SUCH TREMENDOUS BLOWS OF THE
SWORD HE WENT TO SEE M
MABEUF AND M
MABEUF TALKED TO HIM OF HIS HERO
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF FLOWERS
HIS BROTHER THE CURE DIED ABOUT 1830 AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AS WHEN
THE NIGHT IS DRAWING ON THE WHOLE HORIZON GREW DARK FOR M
MABEUF
A
NOTARY'S FAILURE DEPRIVED HIM OF THE SUM OF TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH
WAS ALL THAT HE POSSESSED IN HIS BROTHER'S RIGHT AND HIS OWN
THE
REVOLUTION OF JULY BROUGHT A CRISIS TO PUBLISHING
IN A PERIOD OF
EMBARRASSMENT THE FIRST THING WHICH DOES NOT SELL IS A FLORA
THE FLORA
OF THE ENVIRONS OF CAUTERETZ STOPPED SHORT
WEEKS PASSED BY WITHOUT A
SINGLE PURCHASER
SOMETIMES M
MABEUF STARTED AT THE SOUND OF THE BELL
MONSIEUR SAID MOTHER PLUTARQUE SADLY IT IS THE WATER CARRIER
IN SHORT ONE DAY M
MABEUF QUITTED THE RUE MESIERES ABDICATED THE
FUNCTIONS OF WARDEN GAVE UP SAINT SULPICE SOLD NOT A PART OF HIS
BOOKS BUT OF HIS PRINTS THAT TO WHICH HE WAS THE LEAST ATTACHED AND
INSTALLED HIMSELF IN A LITTLE HOUSE ON THE RUE MONTPARNASSE WHERE
HOWEVER HE REMAINED BUT ONE QUARTER FOR TWO REASONS IN THE FIRST
PLACE THE GROUND FLOOR AND THE GARDEN COST THREE HUNDRED FRANCS AND HE
DARED NOT SPEND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FRANCS ON HIS RENT IN THE SECOND
BEING NEAR FATON'S SHOOTING GALLERY HE COULD HEAR THE PISTOL SHOTS
WHICH WAS INTOLERABLE TO HIM
HE CARRIED OFF HIS FLORA HIS COPPER PLATES HIS HERBARIUMS HIS
PORTFOLIOS AND HIS BOOKS AND ESTABLISHED HIMSELF NEAR THE SALPETRIERE
IN A SORT OF THATCHED COTTAGE OF THE VILLAGE OF AUSTERLITZ WHERE
FOR FIFTY CROWNS A YEAR HE GOT THREE ROOMS AND A GARDEN ENCLOSED BY A
HEDGE AND CONTAINING A WELL
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS REMOVAL TO SELL
OFF NEARLY ALL HIS FURNITURE
ON THE DAY OF HIS ENTRANCE INTO HIS NEW
QUARTERS HE WAS VERY GAY AND DROVE THE NAILS ON WHICH HIS ENGRAVINGS
AND HERBARIUMS WERE TO HANG WITH HIS OWN HANDS DUG IN HIS GARDEN THE
REST OF THE DAY AND AT NIGHT PERCEIVING THAT MOTHER PLUTARQUE HAD A
MELANCHOLY AIR AND WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL HE TAPPED HER ON THE SHOULDER
AND SAID TO HER WITH A SMILE WE HAVE THE INDIGO
ONLY TWO VISITORS THE BOOKSELLER OF THE PORTE SAINT JACQUES AND MARIUS
WERE ADMITTED TO VIEW THE THATCHED COTTAGE AT AUSTERLITZ A BRAWLING
NAME WHICH WAS TO TELL THE TRUTH EXTREMELY DISAGREEABLE TO HIM
HOWEVER AS WE HAVE JUST POINTED OUT BRAINS WHICH ARE ABSORBED IN SOME
BIT OF WISDOM OR FOLLY OR AS IT OFTEN HAPPENS IN BOTH AT ONCE ARE
BUT SLOWLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE THINGS OF ACTUAL LIFE
THEIR OWN DESTINY
IS A FAR OFF THING TO THEM
THERE RESULTS FROM SUCH CONCENTRATION A
PASSIVITY WHICH IF IT WERE THE OUTCOME OF REASONING WOULD RESEMBLE
PHILOSOPHY
ONE DECLINES DESCENDS TRICKLES AWAY EVEN CRUMBLES AWAY
AND YET IS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF IT ONE'S SELF
IT ALWAYS ENDS IT IS
TRUE IN AN AWAKENING BUT THE AWAKENING IS TARDY
IN THE MEANTIME IT
SEEMS AS THOUGH WE HELD OURSELVES NEUTRAL IN THE GAME WHICH IS GOING ON
BETWEEN OUR HAPPINESS AND OUR UNHAPPINESS
WE ARE THE STAKE AND WE LOOK
ON AT THE GAME WITH INDIFFERENCE
IT IS THUS THAT ATHWART THE CLOUD WHICH FORMED ABOUT HIM WHEN ALL HIS
HOPES WERE EXTINGUISHED ONE AFTER THE OTHER M
MABEUF REMAINED RATHER
PUERILELY BUT PROFOUNDLY SERENE
HIS HABITS OF MIND HAD THE REGULAR
SWING OF A PENDULUM
ONCE MOUNTED ON AN ILLUSION HE WENT FOR A VERY
LONG TIME EVEN AFTER THE ILLUSION HAD DISAPPEARED
A CLOCK DOES NOT
STOP SHORT AT THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN THE KEY IS LOST
M
MABEUF HAD HIS INNOCENT PLEASURES
THESE PLEASURES WERE INEXPENSIVE
AND UNEXPECTED THE MEREST CHANCE FURNISHED THEM
ONE DAY MOTHER
PLUTARQUE WAS READING A ROMANCE IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM
SHE WAS
READING ALOUD FINDING THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD BETTER THUS
TO READ ALOUD IS
TO ASSURE ONE'S SELF OF WHAT ONE IS READING
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO READ
VERY LOUD AND WHO HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF GIVING THEMSELVES THEIR WORD
OF HONOR AS TO WHAT THEY ARE PERUSING
IT WAS WITH THIS SORT OF ENERGY THAT MOTHER PLUTARQUE WAS READING THE
ROMANCE WHICH SHE HAD IN HAND
M
MABEUF HEARD HER WITHOUT LISTENING TO
HER
IN THE COURSE OF HER READING MOTHER PLUTARQUE CAME TO THIS PHRASE
IT
WAS A QUESTION OF AN OFFICER OF DRAGOONS AND A BEAUTY
THE BEAUTY POUTED AND THE DRAGOON
HERE SHE INTERRUPTED HERSELF TO WIPE HER GLASSES
BOUDDHA AND THE DRAGON STRUCK IN M
MABEUF IN A LOW VOICE
YES IT
IS TRUE THAT THERE WAS A DRAGON WHICH FROM THE DEPTHS OF ITS CAVE
SPOUTED FLAME THROUGH HIS MAW AND SET THE HEAVENS ON FIRE
MANY STARS
HAD ALREADY BEEN CONSUMED BY THIS MONSTER WHICH BESIDES HAD THE CLAWS
OF A TIGER
BOUDDHA WENT INTO ITS DEN AND SUCCEEDED IN CONVERTING THE
DRAGON
THAT IS A GOOD BOOK THAT YOU ARE READING MOTHER PLUTARQUE
THERE IS NO MORE BEAUTIFUL LEGEND IN EXISTENCE
AND M
MABEUF FELL INTO A DELICIOUS REVERY
CHAPTER V POVERTY A GOOD NEIGHBOR FOR MISERY
MARIUS LIKED THIS CANDID OLD MAN WHO SAW HIMSELF GRADUALLY FALLING INTO
THE CLUTCHES OF INDIGENCE AND WHO CAME TO FEEL ASTONISHMENT LITTLE
BY LITTLE WITHOUT HOWEVER BEING MADE MELANCHOLY BY IT
MARIUS MET
COURFEYRAC AND SOUGHT OUT M
MABEUF
VERY RARELY HOWEVER TWICE A MONTH
AT MOST
MARIUS' PLEASURE CONSISTED IN TAKING LONG WALKS ALONE ON THE OUTER
BOULEVARDS OR IN THE CHAMPS DE MARS OR IN THE LEAST FREQUENTED ALLEYS
OF THE LUXEMBOURG
HE OFTEN SPENT HALF A DAY IN GAZING AT A MARKET
GARDEN THE BEDS OF LETTUCE THE CHICKENS ON THE DUNG HEAP THE HORSE
TURNING THE WATER WHEEL
THE PASSERS BY STARED AT HIM IN SURPRISE AND
SOME OF THEM THOUGHT HIS ATTIRE SUSPICIOUS AND HIS MIEN SINISTER
HE WAS
ONLY A POOR YOUNG MAN DREAMING IN AN OBJECTLESS WAY
IT WAS DURING ONE OF HIS STROLLS THAT HE HAD HIT UPON THE GORBEAU HOUSE
AND TEMPTED BY ITS ISOLATION AND ITS CHEAPNESS HAD TAKEN UP HIS ABODE
THERE
HE WAS KNOWN THERE ONLY UNDER THE NAME OF M
MARIUS
SOME OF HIS FATHER'S OLD GENERALS OR OLD COMRADES HAD INVITED HIM TO GO
AND SEE THEM WHEN THEY LEARNED ABOUT HIM
MARIUS HAD NOT REFUSED THEIR
INVITATIONS
THEY AFFORDED OPPORTUNITIES OF TALKING ABOUT HIS FATHER
THUS HE WENT FROM TIME TO TIME TO COMTE PAJOL TO GENERAL BELLAVESNE
TO GENERAL FRIRION TO THE INVALIDES
THERE WAS MUSIC AND DANCING THERE
ON SUCH EVENINGS MARIUS PUT ON HIS NEW COAT
BUT HE NEVER WENT TO
THESE EVENING PARTIES OR BALLS EXCEPT ON DAYS WHEN IT WAS FREEZING COLD
BECAUSE HE COULD NOT AFFORD A CARRIAGE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO ARRIVE
WITH BOOTS OTHERWISE THAN LIKE MIRRORS
HE SAID SOMETIMES BUT WITHOUT BITTERNESS MEN ARE SO MADE THAT IN A
DRAWING ROOM YOU MAY BE SOILED EVERYWHERE EXCEPT ON YOUR SHOES
IN ORDER
TO INSURE A GOOD RECEPTION THERE ONLY ONE IRREPROACHABLE THING IS ASKED
OF YOU YOUR CONSCIENCE NO YOUR BOOTS
ALL PASSIONS EXCEPT THOSE OF THE HEART ARE DISSIPATED BY REVERY
MARIUS'
POLITICAL FEVERS VANISHED THUS
THE REVOLUTION OF 1830 ASSISTED IN THE
PROCESS BY SATISFYING AND CALMING HIM
HE REMAINED THE SAME SETTING
ASIDE HIS FITS OF WRATH
HE STILL HELD THE SAME OPINIONS
ONLY THEY HAD
BEEN TEMPERED
TO SPEAK ACCURATELY HE HAD NO LONGER ANY OPINIONS HE
HAD SYMPATHIES
TO WHAT PARTY DID HE BELONG TO THE PARTY OF HUMANITY
OUT OF HUMANITY HE CHOSE FRANCE OUT OF THE NATION HE CHOSE THE PEOPLE
OUT OF THE PEOPLE HE CHOSE THE WOMAN
IT WAS TO THAT POINT ABOVE ALL
THAT HIS PITY WAS DIRECTED
NOW HE PREFERRED AN IDEA TO A DEED A
POET TO A HERO AND HE ADMIRED A BOOK LIKE JOB MORE THAN AN EVENT LIKE
MARENGO
AND THEN WHEN AFTER A DAY SPENT IN MEDITATION HE RETURNED
IN THE EVENING THROUGH THE BOULEVARDS AND CAUGHT A GLIMPSE THROUGH
THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES OF THE FATHOMLESS SPACE BEYOND THE NAMELESS
GLEAMS THE ABYSS THE SHADOW THE MYSTERY ALL THAT WHICH IS ONLY HUMAN
SEEMED VERY PETTY INDEED TO HIM
HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD AND HE REALLY HAD IN FACT ARRIVED AT THE TRUTH
OF LIFE AND OF HUMAN PHILOSOPHY AND HE HAD ENDED BY GAZING AT NOTHING
BUT HEAVEN THE ONLY THING WHICH TRUTH CAN PERCEIVE FROM THE BOTTOM OF
HER WELL
THIS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM MULTIPLYING HIS PLANS HIS COMBINATIONS
HIS SCAFFOLDINGS HIS PROJECTS FOR THE FUTURE
IN THIS STATE OF REVERY
AN EYE WHICH COULD HAVE CAST A GLANCE INTO MARIUS' INTERIOR WOULD HAVE
BEEN DAZZLED WITH THE PURITY OF THAT SOUL
IN FACT HAD IT BEEN GIVEN TO
OUR EYES OF THE FLESH TO GAZE INTO THE CONSCIENCES OF OTHERS WE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO JUDGE A MAN MUCH MORE SURELY ACCORDING TO WHAT HE DREAMS
THAN ACCORDING TO WHAT HE THINKS
THERE IS WILL IN THOUGHT THERE IS
NONE IN DREAMS
REVERY WHICH IS UTTERLY SPONTANEOUS TAKES AND KEEPS
EVEN IN THE GIGANTIC AND THE IDEAL THE FORM OF OUR SPIRIT
NOTHING
PROCEEDS MORE DIRECTLY AND MORE SINCERELY FROM THE VERY DEPTH OF OUR
SOUL THAN OUR UNPREMEDITATED AND BOUNDLESS ASPIRATIONS TOWARDS
THE SPLENDORS OF DESTINY
IN THESE ASPIRATIONS MUCH MORE THAN IN
DELIBERATE RATIONAL COORDINATED IDEAS IS THE REAL CHARACTER OF A MAN
TO BE FOUND
OUR CHIMERAS ARE THE THINGS WHICH THE MOST RESEMBLE US
EACH ONE OF US DREAMS OF THE UNKNOWN AND THE IMPOSSIBLE IN ACCORDANCE
WITH HIS NATURE
TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THIS YEAR 1831 THE OLD WOMAN WHO WAITED ON MARIUS
TOLD HIM THAT HIS NEIGHBORS THE WRETCHED JONDRETTE FAMILY HAD BEEN
TURNED OUT OF DOORS
MARIUS WHO PASSED NEARLY THE WHOLE OF HIS DAYS OUT
OF THE HOUSE HARDLY KNEW THAT HE HAD ANY NEIGHBORS
WHY ARE THEY TURNED OUT HE ASKED
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT PAY THEIR RENT THEY OWE FOR TWO QUARTERS
HOW MUCH IS IT
TWENTY FRANCS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
MARIUS HAD THIRTY FRANCS SAVED UP IN A DRAWER
HERE HE SAID TO THE OLD WOMAN TAKE THESE TWENTY FIVE FRANCS
PAY
FOR THE POOR PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM FIVE FRANCS AND DO NOT TELL THEM THAT
IT WAS I
CHAPTER VI THE SUBSTITUTE
IT CHANCED THAT THE REGIMENT TO WHICH LIEUTENANT THEODULE BELONGED CAME
TO PERFORM GARRISON DUTY IN PARIS
THIS INSPIRED AUNT GILLENORMAND WITH
A SECOND IDEA
SHE HAD ON THE FIRST OCCASION HIT UPON THE PLAN OF
HAVING MARIUS SPIED UPON BY THEODULE NOW SHE PLOTTED TO HAVE THEODULE
TAKE MARIUS' PLACE
AT ALL EVENTS AND IN CASE THE GRANDFATHER SHOULD FEEL THE VAGUE NEED OF
A YOUNG FACE IN THE HOUSE THESE RAYS OF DAWN ARE SOMETIMES SWEET TO
RUIN IT WAS EXPEDIENT TO FIND ANOTHER MARIUS
TAKE IT AS A SIMPLE
ERRATUM SHE THOUGHT SUCH AS ONE SEES IN BOOKS
FOR MARIUS READ
THEODULE
A GRANDNEPHEW IS ALMOST THE SAME AS A GRANDSON IN DEFAULT OF A LAWYER
ONE TAKES A LANCER
ONE MORNING WHEN M
GILLENORMAND WAS ABOUT TO READ SOMETHING IN THE
QUOTIDIENNE HIS DAUGHTER ENTERED AND SAID TO HIM IN HER SWEETEST VOICE
FOR THE QUESTION CONCERNED HER FAVORITE
FATHER THEODULE IS COMING TO PRESENT HIS RESPECTS TO YOU THIS
MORNING
WHO'S THEODULE
YOUR GRANDNEPHEW
AH SAID THE GRANDFATHER
THEN HE WENT BACK TO HIS READING THOUGHT NO MORE OF HIS GRANDNEPHEW
WHO WAS MERELY SOME THEODULE OR OTHER AND SOON FLEW INTO A RAGE WHICH
ALMOST ALWAYS HAPPENED WHEN HE READ
THE SHEET WHICH HE HELD ALTHOUGH
ROYALIST OF COURSE ANNOUNCED FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY WITHOUT ANY
SOFTENING PHRASES ONE OF THESE LITTLE EVENTS WHICH WERE OF DAILY
OCCURRENCE AT THAT DATE IN PARIS THAT THE STUDENTS OF THE SCHOOLS
OF LAW AND MEDICINE WERE TO ASSEMBLE ON THE PLACE DU PANTHEON AT
MIDDAY TO DELIBERATE THE DISCUSSION CONCERNED ONE OF THE QUESTIONS
OF THE MOMENT THE ARTILLERY OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND A CONFLICT
BETWEEN THE MINISTER OF WAR AND THE CITIZEN'S MILITIA ON THE SUBJECT
OF THE CANNON PARKED IN THE COURTYARD OF THE LOUVRE
THE STUDENTS WERE
TO DELIBERATE OVER THIS
IT DID NOT TAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS TO SWELL
M
GILLENORMAND'S RAGE
HE THOUGHT OF MARIUS WHO WAS A STUDENT AND WHO WOULD PROBABLY GO WITH
THE REST TO DELIBERATE AT MIDDAY ON THE PLACE DU PANTHEON
AS HE WAS INDULGING IN THIS PAINFUL DREAM LIEUTENANT THEODULE ENTERED
CLAD IN PLAIN CLOTHES AS A BOURGEOIS WHICH WAS CLEVER OF HIM AND
WAS DISCREETLY INTRODUCED BY MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND
THE LANCER HAD
REASONED AS FOLLOWS THE OLD DRUID HAS NOT SUNK ALL HIS MONEY IN A LIFE
PENSION
IT IS WELL TO DISGUISE ONE'S SELF AS A CIVILIAN FROM TIME TO
TIME
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND SAID ALOUD TO HER FATHER
THEODULE YOUR GRANDNEPHEW
AND IN A LOW VOICE TO THE LIEUTENANT
APPROVE OF EVERYTHING
AND SHE WITHDREW
THE LIEUTENANT WHO WAS BUT LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH VENERABLE
ENCOUNTERS STAMMERED WITH SOME TIMIDITY GOOD DAY UNCLE AND MADE
A SALUTE COMPOSED OF THE INVOLUNTARY AND MECHANICAL OUTLINE OF THE
MILITARY SALUTE FINISHED OFF AS A BOURGEOIS SALUTE
AH SO IT'S YOU THAT IS WELL SIT DOWN SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN
THAT SAID HE TOTALLY FORGOT THE LANCER
THEODULE SEATED HIMSELF AND M
GILLENORMAND ROSE
M
GILLENORMAND BEGAN TO PACE BACK AND FORTH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
TALKING ALOUD AND TWITCHING WITH HIS IRRITATED OLD FINGERS AT THE TWO
WATCHES WHICH HE WORE IN HIS TWO FOBS
THAT PACK OF BRATS THEY CONVENE ON THE PLACE DU PANTHEON BY MY LIFE
URCHINS WHO WERE WITH THEIR NURSES BUT YESTERDAY IF ONE WERE TO SQUEEZE
THEIR NOSES MILK WOULD BURST OUT
AND THEY DELIBERATE TO MORROW AT
MIDDAY
WHAT ARE WE COMING TO WHAT ARE WE COMING TO IT IS CLEAR THAT
WE ARE MAKING FOR THE ABYSS
THAT IS WHAT THE DESCAMISADOS HAVE BROUGHT
US TO TO DELIBERATE ON THE CITIZEN ARTILLERY TO GO AND JABBER IN THE
OPEN AIR OVER THE JIBES OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND WITH WHOM ARE THEY TO
MEET THERE JUST SEE WHITHER JACOBINISM LEADS
I WILL BET ANYTHING YOU
LIKE A MILLION AGAINST A COUNTER THAT THERE WILL BE NO ONE THERE BUT
RETURNED CONVICTS AND RELEASED GALLEY SLAVES
THE REPUBLICANS AND THE
GALLEY SLAVES THEY FORM BUT ONE NOSE AND ONE HANDKERCHIEF
CARNOT USED
TO SAY 'WHERE WOULD YOU HAVE ME GO TRAITOR FOUCHE REPLIED 'WHEREVER
YOU PLEASE IMBECILE THAT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE
THAT IS TRUE SAID THEODULE
M
GILLENORMAND HALF TURNED HIS HEAD SAW THEODULE AND WENT ON
WHEN ONE REFLECTS THAT THAT SCOUNDREL WAS SO VILE AS TO TURN CARBONARO
WHY DID YOU LEAVE MY HOUSE TO GO AND BECOME A REPUBLICAN PSSST IN
THE FIRST PLACE THE PEOPLE WANT NONE OF YOUR REPUBLIC THEY HAVE COMMON
SENSE THEY KNOW WELL THAT THERE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN KINGS AND THAT THERE
ALWAYS WILL BE THEY KNOW WELL THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ONLY THE PEOPLE
AFTER ALL THEY MAKE SPORT OF IT OF YOUR REPUBLIC DO YOU UNDERSTAND
IDIOT IS IT NOT A HORRIBLE CAPRICE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH PERE DUCHESNE
TO MAKE SHEEP'S EYES AT THE GUILLOTINE TO SING ROMANCES AND PLAY ON
THE GUITAR UNDER THE BALCONY OF '93 IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE SPIT ON ALL
THESE YOUNG FELLOWS SUCH FOOLS ARE THEY THEY ARE ALL ALIKE
NOT ONE
ESCAPES
IT SUFFICES FOR THEM TO BREATHE THE AIR WHICH BLOWS THROUGH THE
STREET TO LOSE THEIR SENSES
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS POISON
THE
FIRST SCAMP THAT HAPPENS ALONG LETS HIS BEARD GROW LIKE A GOAT'S
THINKS HIMSELF A REAL SCOUNDREL AND ABANDONS HIS OLD RELATIVES
HE'S
A REPUBLICAN HE'S A ROMANTIC
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ROMANTIC DO ME THE
FAVOR TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS
ALL POSSIBLE FOLLIES
A YEAR AGO THEY RAN
TO HERNANI
NOW I JUST ASK YOU HERNANI ANTITHESES ABOMINATIONS
WHICH ARE NOT EVEN WRITTEN IN FRENCH AND THEN THEY HAVE CANNONS IN THE
COURTYARD OF THE LOUVRE
SUCH ARE THE RASCALITIES OF THIS AGE
YOU ARE RIGHT UNCLE SAID THEODULE
M
GILLENORMAND RESUMED
CANNONS IN THE COURTYARD OF THE MUSEUM FOR WHAT PURPOSE DO YOU WANT
TO FIRE GRAPE SHOT AT THE APOLLO BELVEDERE WHAT HAVE THOSE CARTRIDGES
TO DO WITH THE VENUS DE MEDICI OH THE YOUNG MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY ARE
ALL BLACKGUARDS WHAT A PRETTY CREATURE IS THEIR BENJAMIN CONSTANT AND
THOSE WHO ARE NOT RASCALS ARE SIMPLETONS THEY DO ALL THEY CAN TO MAKE
THEMSELVES UGLY THEY ARE BADLY DRESSED THEY ARE AFRAID OF WOMEN IN
THE PRESENCE OF PETTICOATS THEY HAVE A MENDICANT AIR WHICH SETS THE
GIRLS INTO FITS OF LAUGHTER ON MY WORD OF HONOR ONE WOULD SAY THE POOR
CREATURES WERE ASHAMED OF LOVE
THEY ARE DEFORMED AND THEY COMPLETE
THEMSELVES BY BEING STUPID THEY REPEAT THE PUNS OF TIERCELIN AND
POTIER THEY HAVE SACK COATS STABLEMEN'S WAISTCOATS SHIRTS OF COARSE
LINEN TROUSERS OF COARSE CLOTH BOOTS OF COARSE LEATHER AND THEIR
RIGMAROLE RESEMBLES THEIR PLUMAGE
ONE MIGHT MAKE USE OF THEIR JARGON
TO PUT NEW SOLES ON THEIR OLD SHOES
AND ALL THIS AWKWARD BATCH OF BRATS
HAS POLITICAL OPINIONS IF YOU PLEASE
POLITICAL OPINIONS SHOULD BE
STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
THEY FABRICATE SYSTEMS THEY RECAST SOCIETY THEY
DEMOLISH THE MONARCHY THEY FLING ALL LAWS TO THE EARTH THEY PUT THE
ATTIC IN THE CELLAR'S PLACE AND MY PORTER IN THE PLACE OF THE KING THEY
TURN EUROPE TOPSY TURVY THEY RECONSTRUCT THE WORLD AND ALL THEIR LOVE
AFFAIRS CONSIST IN STARING SLILY AT THE ANKLES OF THE LAUNDRESSES AS
THESE WOMEN CLIMB INTO THEIR CARTS
AH MARIUS AH YOU BLACKGUARD TO
GO AND VOCIFERATE ON THE PUBLIC PLACE TO DISCUSS TO DEBATE TO TAKE
MEASURES THEY CALL THAT MEASURES JUST GOD DISORDER HUMBLES ITSELF
AND BECOMES SILLY
I HAVE SEEN CHAOS I NOW SEE A MESS
STUDENTS
DELIBERATING ON THE NATIONAL GUARD SUCH A THING COULD NOT BE SEEN
AMONG THE OGIBEWAS NOR THE CADODACHES SAVAGES WHO GO NAKED WITH THEIR
NODDLES DRESSED LIKE A SHUTTLECOCK WITH A CLUB IN THEIR PAWS ARE LESS
OF BRUTES THAN THOSE BACHELORS OF ARTS THE FOUR PENNY MONKEYS AND THEY
SET UP FOR JUDGES THOSE CREATURES DELIBERATE AND RATIOCINATE THE
END OF THE WORLD IS COME THIS IS PLAINLY THE END OF THIS MISERABLE
TERRAQUEOUS GLOBE A FINAL HICCOUGH WAS REQUIRED AND FRANCE HAS EMITTED
IT
DELIBERATE MY RASCALS SUCH THINGS WILL HAPPEN SO LONG AS THEY GO
AND READ THE NEWSPAPERS UNDER THE ARCADES OF THE ODEON
THAT COSTS THEM
A SOU AND THEIR GOOD SENSE AND THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND THEIR HEART AND
THEIR SOUL AND THEIR WITS
THEY EMERGE THENCE AND DECAMP FROM THEIR
FAMILIES
ALL NEWSPAPERS ARE PESTS ALL EVEN THE DRAPEAU BLANC AT
BOTTOM MARTAINVILLE WAS A JACOBIN
AH JUST HEAVEN YOU MAY BOAST OF
HAVING DRIVEN YOUR GRANDFATHER TO DESPAIR THAT YOU MAY
THAT IS EVIDENT SAID THEODULE
AND PROFITING BY THE FACT THAT M
GILLENORMAND WAS TAKING BREATH THE
LANCER ADDED IN A MAGISTERIAL MANNER
THERE SHOULD BE NO OTHER NEWSPAPER THAN THE MONITEUR AND NO OTHER BOOK
THAN THE ANNUAIRE MILITAIRE
M
GILLENORMAND CONTINUED
IT IS LIKE THEIR SIEYES A REGICIDE ENDING IN A SENATOR FOR THAT IS
THE WAY THEY ALWAYS END
THEY GIVE THEMSELVES A SCAR WITH THE ADDRESS
OF THOU AS CITIZENS IN ORDER TO GET THEMSELVES CALLED EVENTUALLY
MONSIEUR LE COMTE
MONSIEUR LE COMTE AS BIG AS MY ARM ASSASSINS OF
SEPTEMBER
THE PHILOSOPHER SIEYES I WILL DO MYSELF THE JUSTICE TO SAY
THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY BETTER OPINION OF THE PHILOSOPHIES OF ALL
THOSE PHILOSOPHERS THAN OF THE SPECTACLES OF THE GRIMACER OF TIVOLI
ONE DAY I SAW THE SENATORS CROSS THE QUAI MALPLAQUET IN MANTLES OF
VIOLET VELVET SOWN WITH BEES WITH HATS A LA HENRI IV
THEY WERE
HIDEOUS
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED THEM MONKEYS FROM THE TIGER'S COURT
CITIZENS I DECLARE TO YOU THAT YOUR PROGRESS IS MADNESS THAT YOUR
HUMANITY IS A DREAM THAT YOUR REVOLUTION IS A CRIME THAT YOUR REPUBLIC
IS A MONSTER THAT YOUR YOUNG AND VIRGIN FRANCE COMES FROM THE BROTHEL
AND I MAINTAIN IT AGAINST ALL WHOEVER YOU MAY BE WHETHER JOURNALISTS
ECONOMISTS LEGISTS OR EVEN WERE YOU BETTER JUDGES OF LIBERTY OF
EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY THAN THE KNIFE OF THE GUILLOTINE AND THAT I
ANNOUNCE TO YOU MY FINE FELLOWS
PARBLEU CRIED THE LIEUTENANT THAT IS WONDERFULLY TRUE
M
GILLENORMAND PAUSED IN A GESTURE WHICH HE HAD BEGUN WHEELED ROUND
STARED LANCER THEODULE INTENTLY IN THE EYES AND SAID TO HIM
YOU ARE A FOOL
BOOK SIXTH THE CONJUNCTION OF TWO STARS
CHAPTER I THE SOBRIQUET MODE OF FORMATION OF FAMILY NAMES
MARIUS WAS AT THIS EPOCH A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN OF MEDIUM STATURE
WITH THICK AND INTENSELY BLACK HAIR A LOFTY AND INTELLIGENT BROW
WELL OPENED AND PASSIONATE NOSTRILS AN AIR OF CALMNESS AND SINCERITY
AND WITH SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY PROUD THOUGHTFUL AND INNOCENT OVER
HIS WHOLE COUNTENANCE
HIS PROFILE ALL OF WHOSE LINES WERE ROUNDED
WITHOUT THEREBY LOSING THEIR FIRMNESS HAD A CERTAIN GERMANIC SWEETNESS
WHICH HAS MADE ITS WAY INTO THE FRENCH PHYSIOGNOMY BY WAY OF ALSACE
AND LORRAINE AND THAT COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ANGLES WHICH RENDERED
THE SICAMBRES SO EASILY RECOGNIZABLE AMONG THE ROMANS AND WHICH
DISTINGUISHES THE LEONINE FROM THE AQUILINE RACE
HE WAS AT THAT PERIOD
OF LIFE WHEN THE MIND OF MEN WHO THINK IS COMPOSED IN NEARLY EQUAL
PARTS OF DEPTH AND INGENUOUSNESS
A GRAVE SITUATION BEING GIVEN HE
HAD ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE STUPID ONE MORE TURN OF THE KEY AND HE
MIGHT BE SUBLIME
HIS MANNERS WERE RESERVED COLD POLISHED NOT VERY
GENIAL
AS HIS MOUTH WAS CHARMING HIS LIPS THE REDDEST AND HIS TEETH
THE WHITEST IN THE WORLD HIS SMILE CORRECTED THE SEVERITY OF HIS FACE
AS A WHOLE
AT CERTAIN MOMENTS THAT PURE BROW AND THAT VOLUPTUOUS SMILE
PRESENTED A SINGULAR CONTRAST
HIS EYES WERE SMALL BUT HIS GLANCE WAS
LARGE
AT THE PERIOD OF HIS MOST ABJECT MISERY HE HAD OBSERVED THAT YOUNG
GIRLS TURNED ROUND WHEN HE PASSED BY AND HE FLED OR HID WITH DEATH IN
HIS SOUL
HE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE STARING AT HIM BECAUSE OF HIS OLD
CLOTHES AND THAT THEY WERE LAUGHING AT THEM THE FACT IS THAT THEY
STARED AT HIM BECAUSE OF HIS GRACE AND THAT THEY DREAMED OF HIM
THIS MUTE MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN HIM AND THE PRETTY PASSERS BY HAD
MADE HIM SHY
HE CHOSE NONE OF THEM FOR THE EXCELLENT REASON THAT
HE FLED FROM ALL OF THEM
HE LIVED THUS INDEFINITELY STUPIDLY AS
COURFEYRAC SAID
COURFEYRAC ALSO SAID TO HIM DO NOT ASPIRE TO BE VENERABLE THEY
CALLED EACH OTHER THOU IT IS THE TENDENCY OF YOUTHFUL FRIENDSHIPS TO
SLIP INTO THIS MODE OF ADDRESS
LET ME GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE
MY DEAR FELLOW
DON'T READ SO MANY BOOKS AND LOOK A LITTLE MORE AT THE
LASSES
THE JADES HAVE SOME GOOD POINTS ABOUT THEM O MARIUS BY DINT OF
FLEEING AND BLUSHING YOU WILL BECOME BRUTALIZED
ON OTHER OCCASIONS COURFEYRAC ENCOUNTERED HIM AND SAID GOOD MORNING
MONSIEUR L'ABBE
WHEN COURFEYRAC HAD ADDRESSED TO HIM SOME REMARK OF THIS NATURE MARIUS
AVOIDED WOMEN BOTH YOUNG AND OLD MORE THAN EVER FOR A WEEK TO COME
AND HE AVOIDED COURFEYRAC TO BOOT
NEVERTHELESS THERE EXISTED IN ALL THE IMMENSITY OF CREATION TWO WOMEN
WHOM MARIUS DID NOT FLEE AND TO WHOM HE PAID NO ATTENTION WHATEVER
IN
TRUTH HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH AMAZED IF HE HAD BEEN INFORMED
THAT THEY WERE WOMEN
ONE WAS THE BEARDED OLD WOMAN WHO SWEPT OUT HIS
CHAMBER AND CAUSED COURFEYRAC TO SAY SEEING THAT HIS SERVANT WOMAN
WEARS HIS BEARD MARIUS DOES NOT WEAR HIS OWN BEARD THE OTHER WAS A
SORT OF LITTLE GIRL WHOM HE SAW VERY OFTEN AND WHOM HE NEVER LOOKED AT
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR MARIUS HAD NOTICED IN ONE OF THE WALKS OF THE
LUXEMBOURG THE ONE WHICH SKIRTS THE PARAPET OF THE PEPINIERE A MAN
AND A VERY YOUNG GIRL WHO WERE ALMOST ALWAYS SEATED SIDE BY SIDE ON THE
SAME BENCH AT THE MOST SOLITARY END OF THE ALLEY ON THE RUE DE L'OUEST
SIDE
EVERY TIME THAT THAT CHANCE WHICH MEDDLES WITH THE STROLLS OF
PERSONS WHOSE GAZE IS TURNED INWARDS LED MARIUS TO THAT WALK AND IT
WAS NEARLY EVERY DAY HE FOUND THIS COUPLE THERE
THE MAN APPEARED TO
BE ABOUT SIXTY YEARS OF AGE HE SEEMED SAD AND SERIOUS HIS WHOLE PERSON
PRESENTED THE ROBUST AND WEARY ASPECT PECULIAR TO MILITARY MEN WHO HAVE
RETIRED FROM THE SERVICE
IF HE HAD WORN A DECORATION MARIUS WOULD HAVE
SAID HE IS AN EX OFFICER HE HAD A KINDLY BUT UNAPPROACHABLE AIR
AND HE NEVER LET HIS GLANCE LINGER ON THE EYES OF ANY ONE
HE WORE
BLUE TROUSERS A BLUE FROCK COAT AND A BROAD BRIMMED HAT WHICH ALWAYS
APPEARED TO BE NEW A BLACK CRAVAT A QUAKER SHIRT THAT IS TO SAY IT
WAS DAZZLINGLY WHITE BUT OF COARSE LINEN
A GRISETTE WHO PASSED NEAR
HIM ONE DAY SAID HERE'S A VERY TIDY WIDOWER HIS HAIR WAS VERY
WHITE
THE FIRST TIME THAT THE YOUNG GIRL WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM CAME AND SEATED
HERSELF ON THE BENCH WHICH THEY SEEMED TO HAVE ADOPTED SHE WAS A SORT
OF CHILD THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE SO THIN AS TO BE ALMOST
HOMELY AWKWARD INSIGNIFICANT AND WITH A POSSIBLE PROMISE OF
HANDSOME EYES
ONLY THEY WERE ALWAYS RAISED WITH A SORT OF DISPLEASING
ASSURANCE
HER DRESS WAS BOTH AGED AND CHILDISH LIKE THE DRESS OF THE
SCHOLARS IN A CONVENT IT CONSISTED OF A BADLY CUT GOWN OF BLACK MERINO
THEY HAD THE AIR OF BEING FATHER AND DAUGHTER
MARIUS SCANNED THIS OLD MAN WHO WAS NOT YET AGED AND THIS LITTLE
GIRL WHO WAS NOT YET A PERSON FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEREAFTER PAID NO
ATTENTION TO THEM
THEY ON THEIR SIDE DID NOT APPEAR EVEN TO SEE HIM
THEY CONVERSED TOGETHER WITH A PEACEFUL AND INDIFFERENT AIR
THE GIRL
CHATTERED INCESSANTLY AND MERRILY
THE OLD MAN TALKED BUT LITTLE AND
AT TIMES HE FIXED ON HER EYES OVERFLOWING WITH AN INEFFABLE PATERNITY
MARIUS HAD ACQUIRED THE MECHANICAL HABIT OF STROLLING IN THAT WALK
HE
INVARIABLY FOUND THEM THERE
THIS IS THE WAY THINGS WENT
MARIUS LIKED TO ARRIVE BY THE END OF THE ALLEY WHICH WAS FURTHEST FROM
THEIR BENCH HE WALKED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE ALLEY PASSED IN FRONT
OF THEM THEN RETURNED TO THE EXTREMITY WHENCE HE HAD COME AND BEGAN
AGAIN
THIS HE DID FIVE OR SIX TIMES IN THE COURSE OF HIS PROMENADE
AND THE PROMENADE WAS TAKEN FIVE OR SIX TIMES A WEEK WITHOUT ITS
HAVING OCCURRED TO HIM OR TO THESE PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE A GREETING
THAT
PERSONAGE AND THAT YOUNG GIRL ALTHOUGH THEY APPEARED AND PERHAPS
BECAUSE THEY APPEARED TO SHUN ALL GLANCES HAD NATURALLY CAUSED SOME
ATTENTION ON THE PART OF THE FIVE OR SIX STUDENTS WHO STROLLED ALONG
THE PEPINIERE FROM TIME TO TIME THE STUDIOUS AFTER THEIR LECTURES
THE OTHERS AFTER THEIR GAME OF BILLIARDS
COURFEYRAC WHO WAS AMONG THE
LAST HAD OBSERVED THEM SEVERAL TIMES BUT FINDING THE GIRL HOMELY HE
HAD SPEEDILY AND CAREFULLY KEPT OUT OF THE WAY
HE HAD FLED DISCHARGING
AT THEM A SOBRIQUET LIKE A PARTHIAN DART
IMPRESSED SOLELY WITH
THE CHILD'S GOWN AND THE OLD MAN'S HAIR HE HAD DUBBED THE DAUGHTER
MADEMOISELLE LANOIRE AND THE FATHER MONSIEUR LEBLANC SO THAT AS NO
ONE KNEW THEM UNDER ANY OTHER TITLE THIS NICKNAME BECAME A LAW IN THE
DEFAULT OF ANY OTHER NAME
THE STUDENTS SAID AH MONSIEUR LEBLANC IS
ON HIS BENCH AND MARIUS LIKE THE REST HAD FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO
CALL THIS UNKNOWN GENTLEMAN MONSIEUR LEBLANC
WE SHALL FOLLOW THEIR EXAMPLE AND WE SHALL SAY M
LEBLANC IN ORDER TO
FACILITATE THIS TALE
SO MARIUS SAW THEM NEARLY EVERY DAY AT THE SAME HOUR DURING THE FIRST
YEAR
HE FOUND THE MAN TO HIS TASTE BUT THE GIRL INSIPID
CHAPTER II LUX FACTA EST
DURING THE SECOND YEAR PRECISELY AT THE POINT IN THIS HISTORY WHICH THE
READER HAS NOW REACHED IT CHANCED THAT THIS HABIT OF THE LUXEMBOURG WAS
INTERRUPTED WITHOUT MARIUS HIMSELF BEING QUITE AWARE WHY AND NEARLY
SIX MONTHS ELAPSED DURING WHICH HE DID NOT SET FOOT IN THE ALLEY
ONE
DAY AT LAST HE RETURNED THITHER ONCE MORE IT WAS A SERENE SUMMER
MORNING AND MARIUS WAS IN JOYOUS MOOD AS ONE IS WHEN THE WEATHER IS
FINE
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD IN HIS HEART ALL THE SONGS OF THE
BIRDS THAT HE WAS LISTENING TO AND ALL THE BITS OF BLUE SKY OF WHICH HE
CAUGHT GLIMPSES THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE TREES
HE WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS ALLEY AND WHEN HE REACHED THE END OF IT HE
PERCEIVED STILL ON THE SAME BENCH THAT WELL KNOWN COUPLE
ONLY WHEN
HE APPROACHED IT CERTAINLY WAS THE SAME MAN BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT
IT WAS NO LONGER THE SAME GIRL
THE PERSON WHOM HE NOW BEHELD WAS A TALL
AND BEAUTIFUL CREATURE POSSESSED OF ALL THE MOST CHARMING LINES OF A
WOMAN AT THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN THEY ARE STILL COMBINED WITH ALL THE
MOST INGENUOUS GRACES OF THE CHILD A PURE AND FUGITIVE MOMENT WHICH
CAN BE EXPRESSED ONLY BY THESE TWO WORDS FIFTEEN YEARS SHE HAD
WONDERFUL BROWN HAIR SHADED WITH THREADS OF GOLD A BROW THAT SEEMED
MADE OF MARBLE CHEEKS THAT SEEMED MADE OF ROSE LEAF A PALE FLUSH
AN AGITATED WHITENESS AN EXQUISITE MOUTH WHENCE SMILES DARTED LIKE
SUNBEAMS AND WORDS LIKE MUSIC A HEAD SUCH AS RAPHAEL WOULD HAVE GIVEN
TO MARY SET UPON A NECK THAT JEAN GOUJON WOULD HAVE ATTRIBUTED TO A
VENUS
AND IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT BE LACKING TO THIS BEWITCHING
FACE HER NOSE WAS NOT HANDSOME IT WAS PRETTY NEITHER STRAIGHT NOR
CURVED NEITHER ITALIAN NOR GREEK IT WAS THE PARISIAN NOSE THAT IS
TO SAY SPIRITUAL DELICATE IRREGULAR PURE WHICH DRIVES PAINTERS TO
DESPAIR AND CHARMS POETS
WHEN MARIUS PASSED NEAR HER HE COULD NOT SEE HER EYES WHICH WERE
CONSTANTLY LOWERED
HE SAW ONLY HER LONG CHESTNUT LASHES PERMEATED WITH
SHADOW AND MODESTY
THIS DID NOT PREVENT THE BEAUTIFUL CHILD FROM SMILING AS SHE LISTENED
TO WHAT THE WHITE HAIRED OLD MAN WAS SAYING TO HER AND NOTHING COULD
BE MORE FASCINATING THAN THAT FRESH SMILE COMBINED WITH THOSE DROOPING
EYES
FOR A MOMENT MARIUS THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS ANOTHER DAUGHTER OF THE SAME
MAN A SISTER OF THE FORMER NO DOUBT
BUT WHEN THE INVARIABLE HABIT OF
HIS STROLL BROUGHT HIM FOR THE SECOND TIME NEAR THE BENCH AND HE HAD
EXAMINED HER ATTENTIVELY HE RECOGNIZED HER AS THE SAME
IN SIX MONTHS
THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BECOME A YOUNG MAIDEN THAT WAS ALL
NOTHING IS MORE
FREQUENT THAN THIS PHENOMENON
THERE IS A MOMENT WHEN GIRLS BLOSSOM OUT
IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AND BECOME ROSES ALL AT ONCE
ONE LEFT
THEM CHILDREN BUT YESTERDAY TODAY ONE FINDS THEM DISQUIETING TO THE
FEELINGS
THIS CHILD HAD NOT ONLY GROWN SHE HAD BECOME IDEALIZED
AS THREE DAYS
IN APRIL SUFFICE TO COVER CERTAIN TREES WITH FLOWERS SIX MONTHS HAD
SUFFICED TO CLOTHE HER WITH BEAUTY
HER APRIL HAD ARRIVED
ONE SOMETIMES SEES PEOPLE WHO POOR AND MEAN SEEM TO WAKE UP PASS
SUDDENLY FROM INDIGENCE TO LUXURY INDULGE IN EXPENDITURES OF ALL SORTS
AND BECOME DAZZLING PRODIGAL MAGNIFICENT ALL OF A SUDDEN
THAT IS
THE RESULT OF HAVING POCKETED AN INCOME A NOTE FELL DUE YESTERDAY
THE
YOUNG GIRL HAD RECEIVED HER QUARTERLY INCOME
AND THEN SHE WAS NO LONGER THE SCHOOL GIRL WITH HER FELT HAT HER
MERINO GOWN HER SCHOLAR'S SHOES AND RED HANDS TASTE HAD COME TO HER
WITH BEAUTY SHE WAS A WELL DRESSED PERSON CLAD WITH A SORT OF RICH
AND SIMPLE ELEGANCE AND WITHOUT AFFECTATION
SHE WORE A DRESS OF BLACK
DAMASK A CAPE OF THE SAME MATERIAL AND A BONNET OF WHITE CRAPE
HER
WHITE GLOVES DISPLAYED THE DELICACY OF THE HAND WHICH TOYED WITH THE
CARVED CHINESE IVORY HANDLE OF A PARASOL AND HER SILKEN SHOE OUTLINED
THE SMALLNESS OF HER FOOT
WHEN ONE PASSED NEAR HER HER WHOLE TOILETTE
EXHALED A YOUTHFUL AND PENETRATING PERFUME
AS FOR THE MAN HE WAS THE SAME AS USUAL
THE SECOND TIME THAT MARIUS APPROACHED HER THE YOUNG GIRL RAISED HER
EYELIDS HER EYES WERE OF A DEEP CELESTIAL BLUE BUT IN THAT VEILED
AZURE THERE WAS AS YET NOTHING BUT THE GLANCE OF A CHILD
SHE LOOKED
AT MARIUS INDIFFERENTLY AS SHE WOULD HAVE STARED AT THE BRAT RUNNING
BENEATH THE SYCAMORES OR THE MARBLE VASE WHICH CAST A SHADOW ON THE
BENCH AND MARIUS ON HIS SIDE CONTINUED HIS PROMENADE AND THOUGHT
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
HE PASSED NEAR THE BENCH WHERE THE YOUNG GIRL SAT FIVE OR SIX TIMES
BUT WITHOUT EVEN TURNING HIS EYES IN HER DIRECTION
ON THE FOLLOWING DAYS HE RETURNED AS WAS HIS WONT TO THE LUXEMBOURG
AS USUAL HE FOUND THERE THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER BUT HE PAID NO
FURTHER ATTENTION TO THEM
HE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE GIRL NOW THAT
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL THAN HE HAD WHEN SHE WAS HOMELY
HE PASSED VERY NEAR
THE BENCH WHERE SHE SAT BECAUSE SUCH WAS HIS HABIT
CHAPTER III EFFECT OF THE SPRING
ONE DAY THE AIR WAS WARM THE LUXEMBOURG WAS INUNDATED WITH LIGHT
AND SHADE THE SKY WAS AS PURE AS THOUGH THE ANGELS HAD WASHED IT THAT
MORNING THE SPARROWS WERE GIVING VENT TO LITTLE TWITTERS IN THE DEPTHS
OF THE CHESTNUT TREES
MARIUS HAD THROWN OPEN HIS WHOLE SOUL TO NATURE
HE WAS NOT THINKING OF ANYTHING HE SIMPLY LIVED AND BREATHED HE PASSED
NEAR THE BENCH THE YOUNG GIRL RAISED HER EYES TO HIM THE TWO GLANCES
MET
WHAT WAS THERE IN THE YOUNG GIRL'S GLANCE ON THIS OCCASION MARIUS COULD
NOT HAVE TOLD
THERE WAS NOTHING AND THERE WAS EVERYTHING
IT WAS A
STRANGE FLASH
SHE DROPPED HER EYES AND HE PURSUED HIS WAY
WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN WAS NO LONGER THE INGENUOUS AND SIMPLE EYE OF A
CHILD IT WAS A MYSTERIOUS GULF WHICH HAD HALF OPENED THEN ABRUPTLY
CLOSED AGAIN
THERE COMES A DAY WHEN THE YOUNG GIRL GLANCES IN THIS MANNER
WOE TO HIM
WHO CHANCES TO BE THERE
THAT FIRST GAZE OF A SOUL WHICH DOES NOT AS YET KNOW ITSELF IS
LIKE THE DAWN IN THE SKY
IT IS THE AWAKENING OF SOMETHING RADIANT
AND STRANGE
NOTHING CAN GIVE ANY IDEA OF THE DANGEROUS CHARM OF THAT
UNEXPECTED GLEAM WHICH FLASHES SUDDENLY AND VAGUELY FORTH FROM ADORABLE
SHADOWS AND WHICH IS COMPOSED OF ALL THE INNOCENCE OF THE PRESENT AND
OF ALL THE PASSION OF THE FUTURE
IT IS A SORT OF UNDECIDED TENDERNESS
WHICH REVEALS ITSELF BY CHANCE AND WHICH WAITS
IT IS A SNARE WHICH
THE INNOCENT MAIDEN SETS UNKNOWN TO HERSELF AND IN WHICH SHE CAPTURES
HEARTS WITHOUT EITHER WISHING OR KNOWING IT
IT IS A VIRGIN LOOKING LIKE
A WOMAN
IT IS RARE THAT A PROFOUND REVERY DOES NOT SPRING FROM THAT GLANCE
WHERE IT FALLS
ALL PURITIES AND ALL CANDORS MEET IN THAT CELESTIAL
AND FATAL GLEAM WHICH MORE THAN ALL THE BEST PLANNED TENDER GLANCES OF
COQUETTES POSSESSES THE MAGIC POWER OF CAUSING THE SUDDEN BLOSSOMING
IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SOUL OF THAT SOMBRE FLOWER IMPREGNATED WITH
PERFUME AND WITH POISON WHICH IS CALLED LOVE
THAT EVENING ON HIS RETURN TO HIS GARRET MARIUS CAST HIS EYES OVER
HIS GARMENTS AND PERCEIVED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HE HAD BEEN SO
SLOVENLY INDECOROUS AND INCONCEIVABLY STUPID AS TO GO FOR HIS WALK IN
THE LUXEMBOURG WITH HIS EVERY DAY CLOTHES THAT IS TO SAY WITH A
HAT BATTERED NEAR THE BAND COARSE CARTER'S BOOTS BLACK TROUSERS
WHICH SHOWED WHITE AT THE KNEES AND A BLACK COAT WHICH WAS PALE AT THE
ELBOWS
CHAPTER IV BEGINNING OF A GREAT MALADY
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT THE ACCUSTOMED HOUR MARIUS DREW FROM HIS
WARDROBE HIS NEW COAT HIS NEW TROUSERS HIS NEW HAT AND HIS NEW
BOOTS HE CLOTHED HIMSELF IN THIS COMPLETE PANOPLY PUT ON HIS GLOVES A
TREMENDOUS LUXURY AND SET OFF FOR THE LUXEMBOURG
ON THE WAY THITHER HE ENCOUNTERED COURFEYRAC AND PRETENDED NOT TO SEE
HIM
COURFEYRAC ON HIS RETURN HOME SAID TO HIS FRIENDS
I HAVE JUST MET MARIUS' NEW HAT AND NEW COAT WITH MARIUS INSIDE
THEM
HE WAS GOING TO PASS AN EXAMINATION NO DOUBT
HE LOOKED UTTERLY
STUPID
ON ARRIVING AT THE LUXEMBOURG MARIUS MADE THE TOUR OF THE FOUNTAIN
BASIN AND STARED AT THE SWANS THEN HE REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME IN
CONTEMPLATION BEFORE A STATUE WHOSE HEAD WAS PERFECTLY BLACK WITH MOULD
AND ONE OF WHOSE HIPS WAS MISSING
NEAR THE BASIN THERE WAS A BOURGEOIS
FORTY YEARS OF AGE WITH A PROMINENT STOMACH WHO WAS HOLDING BY THE
HAND A LITTLE URCHIN OF FIVE AND SAYING TO HIM SHUN EXCESS MY SON
KEEP AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM DESPOTISM AND FROM ANARCHY MARIUS
LISTENED TO THIS BOURGEOIS
THEN HE MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE BASIN ONCE
MORE
AT LAST HE DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARDS HIS ALLEY SLOWLY AND AS
IF WITH REGRET
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS BOTH FORCED TO GO THERE
AND WITHHELD FROM DOING SO
HE DID NOT PERCEIVE IT HIMSELF AND THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS DOING AS HE ALWAYS DID
ON TURNING INTO THE WALK HE SAW M
LEBLANC AND THE YOUNG GIRL AT THE
OTHER END ON THEIR BENCH HE BUTTONED HIS COAT UP TO THE VERY TOP
PULLED IT DOWN ON HIS BODY SO THAT THERE MIGHT BE NO WRINKLES EXAMINED
WITH A CERTAIN COMPLAISANCE THE LUSTROUS GLEAMS OF HIS TROUSERS AND
MARCHED ON THE BENCH
THIS MARCH SAVORED OF AN ATTACK AND CERTAINLY
OF A DESIRE FOR CONQUEST
SO I SAY THAT HE MARCHED ON THE BENCH AS I
SHOULD SAY HANNIBAL MARCHED ON ROME
HOWEVER ALL HIS MOVEMENTS WERE PURELY MECHANICAL AND HE HAD
INTERRUPTED NONE OF THE HABITUAL PREOCCUPATIONS OF HIS MIND AND LABORS
AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS THINKING THAT THE MANUEL DU BACCALAUREAT WAS
A STUPID BOOK AND THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP BY RARE IDIOTS TO
ALLOW OF THREE TRAGEDIES OF RACINE AND ONLY ONE COMEDY OF MOLIERE BEING
ANALYZED THEREIN AS MASTERPIECES OF THE HUMAN MIND
THERE WAS A PIERCING
WHISTLING GOING ON IN HIS EARS
AS HE APPROACHED THE BENCH HE HELD
FAST TO THE FOLDS IN HIS COAT AND FIXED HIS EYES ON THE YOUNG GIRL
IT
SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE FILLED THE ENTIRE EXTREMITY OF THE ALLEY WITH A
VAGUE BLUE LIGHT
IN PROPORTION AS HE DREW NEAR HIS PACE SLACKENED MORE AND MORE
ON
ARRIVING AT SOME LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE BENCH AND LONG BEFORE HE HAD
REACHED THE END OF THE WALK HE HALTED AND COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO HIMSELF
WHY HE RETRACED HIS STEPS
HE DID NOT EVEN SAY TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD
NOT GO AS FAR AS THE END
IT WAS ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE YOUNG
GIRL COULD HAVE PERCEIVED HIM IN THE DISTANCE AND NOTED HIS FINE
APPEARANCE IN HIS NEW CLOTHES
NEVERTHELESS HE HELD HIMSELF VERY ERECT
IN CASE ANY ONE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HIM FROM BEHIND
HE ATTAINED THE OPPOSITE END THEN CAME BACK AND THIS TIME HE
APPROACHED A LITTLE NEARER TO THE BENCH
HE EVEN GOT TO WITHIN THREE
INTERVALS OF TREES BUT THERE HE FELT AN INDESCRIBABLE IMPOSSIBILITY OF
PROCEEDING FURTHER AND HE HESITATED
HE THOUGHT HE SAW THE YOUNG GIRL'S
FACE BENDING TOWARDS HIM
BUT HE EXERTED A MANLY AND VIOLENT EFFORT
SUBDUED HIS HESITATION AND WALKED STRAIGHT AHEAD
A FEW SECONDS LATER
HE RUSHED IN FRONT OF THE BENCH ERECT AND FIRM REDDENING TO THE VERY
EARS WITHOUT DARING TO CAST A GLANCE EITHER TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE
LEFT WITH HIS HAND THRUST INTO HIS COAT LIKE A STATESMAN
AT THE MOMENT
WHEN HE PASSED UNDER THE CANNON OF THE PLACE HE FELT HIS HEART BEAT
WILDLY
AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY SHE WORE HER DAMASK GOWN AND HER CRAPE
BONNET
HE HEARD AN INEFFABLE VOICE WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN HER VOICE
SHE WAS TALKING TRANQUILLY
SHE WAS VERY PRETTY
HE FELT IT ALTHOUGH HE
MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE HER
SHE COULD NOT HOWEVER HE THOUGHT HELP
FEELING ESTEEM AND CONSIDERATION FOR ME IF SHE ONLY KNEW THAT I AM
THE VERITABLE AUTHOR OF THE DISSERTATION ON MARCOS OBREGON DE LA RONDE
WHICH M
FRANCOIS DE NEUFCHATEAU PUT AS THOUGH IT WERE HIS OWN AT THE
HEAD OF HIS EDITION OF GIL BLAS HE WENT BEYOND THE BENCH AS FAR AS THE
EXTREMITY OF THE WALK WHICH WAS VERY NEAR THEN TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND
PASSED ONCE MORE IN FRONT OF THE LOVELY GIRL
THIS TIME HE WAS VERY
PALE
MOREOVER ALL HIS EMOTIONS WERE DISAGREEABLE
AS HE WENT FURTHER
FROM THE BENCH AND THE YOUNG GIRL AND WHILE HIS BACK WAS TURNED TO HER
HE FANCIED THAT SHE WAS GAZING AFTER HIM AND THAT MADE HIM STUMBLE
HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO APPROACH THE BENCH AGAIN HE HALTED NEAR THE
MIDDLE OF THE WALK AND THERE A THING WHICH HE NEVER DID HE SAT DOWN
AND REFLECTING IN THE MOST PROFOUNDLY INDISTINCT DEPTHS OF HIS SPIRIT
THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS HARD THAT PERSONS WHOSE WHITE BONNET AND BLACK
GOWN HE ADMIRED SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY INSENSIBLE TO HIS SPLENDID TROUSERS
AND HIS NEW COAT
AT THE EXPIRATION OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE ROSE AS THOUGH HE WERE
ON THE POINT OF AGAIN BEGINNING HIS MARCH TOWARDS THAT BENCH WHICH WAS
SURROUNDED BY AN AUREOLE
BUT HE REMAINED STANDING THERE MOTIONLESS
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIFTEEN MONTHS HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THAT
GENTLEMAN WHO SAT THERE EVERY DAY WITH HIS DAUGHTER HAD ON HIS SIDE
NOTICED HIM AND PROBABLY CONSIDERED HIS ASSIDUITY SINGULAR
FOR THE FIRST TIME ALSO HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF SOME IRREVERENCE IN
DESIGNATING THAT STRANGER EVEN IN HIS SECRET THOUGHTS BY THE SOBRIQUET
OF M
LE BLANC
HE STOOD THUS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITH DROOPING HEAD TRACING FIGURES
IN THE SAND WITH THE CANE WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND
THEN HE TURNED ABRUPTLY IN THE DIRECTION OPPOSITE TO THE BENCH TO M
LEBLANC AND HIS DAUGHTER AND WENT HOME
THAT DAY HE FORGOT TO DINE
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING HE PERCEIVED
THIS FACT AND AS IT WAS TOO LATE TO GO DOWN TO THE RUE SAINT JACQUES
HE SAID NEVER MIND AND ATE A BIT OF BREAD
HE DID NOT GO TO BED UNTIL HE HAD BRUSHED HIS COAT AND FOLDED IT UP WITH
GREAT CARE
CHAPTER V DIVRS CLAPS OF THUNDER FALL ON MA'AM BOUGON
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY MA'AM BOUGON AS COURFEYRAC STYLED THE OLD
PORTRESS PRINCIPAL TENANT HOUSEKEEPER OF THE GORBEAU HOVEL MA'AM
BOUGON WHOSE NAME WAS IN REALITY MADAME BURGON AS WE HAVE FOUND
OUT BUT THIS ICONOCLAST COURFEYRAC RESPECTED NOTHING MA'AM BOUGON
OBSERVED WITH STUPEFACTION THAT M
MARIUS WAS GOING OUT AGAIN IN HIS
NEW COAT
HE WENT TO THE LUXEMBOURG AGAIN BUT HE DID NOT PROCEED FURTHER THAN HIS
BENCH MIDWAY OF THE ALLEY
HE SEATED HIMSELF THERE AS ON THE PRECEDING
DAY SURVEYING FROM A DISTANCE AND CLEARLY MAKING OUT THE WHITE
BONNET THE BLACK DRESS AND ABOVE ALL THAT BLUE LIGHT
HE DID NOT STIR
FROM IT AND ONLY WENT HOME WHEN THE GATES OF THE LUXEMBOURG CLOSED
HE
DID NOT SEE M
LEBLANC AND HIS DAUGHTER RETIRE
HE CONCLUDED THAT THEY
HAD QUITTED THE GARDEN BY THE GATE ON THE RUE DE L'OUEST
LATER ON
SEVERAL WEEKS AFTERWARDS WHEN HE CAME TO THINK IT OVER HE COULD NEVER
RECALL WHERE HE HAD DINED THAT EVENING
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHICH WAS THE THIRD MA'AM BOUGON WAS
THUNDERSTRUCK
MARIUS WENT OUT IN HIS NEW COAT
THREE DAYS IN
SUCCESSION SHE EXCLAIMED
SHE TRIED TO FOLLOW HIM BUT MARIUS WALKED BRISKLY AND WITH IMMENSE
STRIDES IT WAS A HIPPOPOTAMUS UNDERTAKING THE PURSUIT OF A CHAMOIS
SHE LOST SIGHT OF HIM IN TWO MINUTES AND RETURNED BREATHLESS
THREE QUARTERS CHOKED WITH ASTHMA AND FURIOUS
IF THERE IS ANY SENSE
SHE GROWLED IN PUTTING ON ONE'S BEST CLOTHES EVERY DAY AND MAKING
PEOPLE RUN LIKE THIS
MARIUS BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE LUXEMBOURG
THE YOUNG GIRL WAS THERE WITH M
LEBLANC
MARIUS APPROACHED AS NEAR AS
HE COULD PRETENDING TO BE BUSY READING A BOOK BUT HE HALTED AFAR OFF
THEN RETURNED AND SEATED HIMSELF ON HIS BENCH WHERE HE SPENT FOUR HOURS
IN WATCHING THE HOUSE SPARROWS WHO WERE SKIPPING ABOUT THE WALK AND WHO
PRODUCED ON HIM THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE MAKING SPORT OF HIM
A FORTNIGHT PASSED THUS
MARIUS WENT TO THE LUXEMBOURG NO LONGER FOR THE
SAKE OF STROLLING THERE BUT TO SEAT HIMSELF ALWAYS IN THE SAME SPOT
AND THAT WITHOUT KNOWING WHY
ONCE ARRIVED THERE HE DID NOT STIR
HE PUT ON HIS NEW COAT EVERY MORNING FOR THE PURPOSE OF NOT SHOWING
HIMSELF AND HE BEGAN ALL OVER AGAIN ON THE MORROW
SHE WAS DECIDEDLY A MARVELLOUS BEAUTY
THE ONLY REMARK APPROACHING A
CRITICISM THAT COULD BE MADE WAS THAT THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN
HER GAZE WHICH WAS MELANCHOLY AND HER SMILE WHICH WAS MERRY GAVE
A RATHER WILD EFFECT TO HER FACE WHICH SOMETIMES CAUSED THIS SWEET
COUNTENANCE TO BECOME STRANGE WITHOUT CEASING TO BE CHARMING
CHAPTER VI TAKEN PRISONER
ON ONE OF THE LAST DAYS OF THE SECOND WEEK MARIUS WAS SEATED ON HIS
BENCH AS USUAL HOLDING IN HIS HAND AN OPEN BOOK OF WHICH HE HAD NOT
TURNED A PAGE FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS
ALL AT ONCE HE STARTED
AN EVENT
WAS TAKING PLACE AT THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF THE WALK
LEBLANC AND HIS
DAUGHTER HAD JUST LEFT THEIR SEAT AND THE DAUGHTER HAD TAKEN HER
FATHER'S ARM AND BOTH WERE ADVANCING SLOWLY TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE
ALLEY WHERE MARIUS WAS
MARIUS CLOSED HIS BOOK THEN OPENED IT AGAIN
THEN FORCED HIMSELF TO READ HE TREMBLED THE AUREOLE WAS COMING
STRAIGHT TOWARDS HIM
AH GOOD HEAVENS THOUGHT HE I SHALL NOT HAVE
TIME TO STRIKE AN ATTITUDE STILL THE WHITE HAIRED MAN AND THE GIRL
ADVANCED
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THIS LASTED FOR A CENTURY AND THAT IT
WAS BUT A SECOND
WHAT ARE THEY COMING IN THIS DIRECTION FOR HE ASKED
HIMSELF
WHAT SHE WILL PASS HERE HER FEET WILL TREAD THIS SAND THIS
WALK TWO PACES FROM ME HE WAS UTTERLY UPSET HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO
BE VERY HANDSOME HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO OWN THE CROSS
HE HEARD THE
SOFT AND MEASURED SOUND OF THEIR APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
HE IMAGINED THAT
M
LEBLANC WAS DARTING ANGRY GLANCES AT HIM
IS THAT GENTLEMAN GOING TO
ADDRESS ME HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
HE DROPPED HIS HEAD WHEN HE RAISED
IT AGAIN THEY WERE VERY NEAR HIM
THE YOUNG GIRL PASSED AND AS SHE
PASSED SHE GLANCED AT HIM
SHE GAZED STEADILY AT HIM WITH A PENSIVE
SWEETNESS WHICH THRILLED MARIUS FROM HEAD TO FOOT
IT SEEMED TO HIM
THAT SHE WAS REPROACHING HIM FOR HAVING ALLOWED SO LONG A TIME TO ELAPSE
WITHOUT COMING AS FAR AS HER AND THAT SHE WAS SAYING TO HIM I AM
COMING MYSELF MARIUS WAS DAZZLED BY THOSE EYES FRAUGHT WITH RAYS AND
ABYSSES
HE FELT HIS BRAIN ON FIRE
SHE HAD COME TO HIM WHAT JOY AND THEN HOW
SHE HAD LOOKED AT HIM SHE APPEARED TO HIM MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HE HAD
EVER SEEN HER YET
BEAUTIFUL WITH A BEAUTY WHICH WAS WHOLLY FEMININE AND
ANGELIC WITH A COMPLETE BEAUTY WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE PETRARCH SING AND
DANTE KNEEL
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS FLOATING FREE IN THE AZURE
HEAVENS
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS HORRIBLY VEXED BECAUSE THERE WAS DUST
ON HIS BOOTS
HE THOUGHT HE FELT SURE THAT SHE HAD LOOKED AT HIS BOOTS TOO
HE FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES UNTIL SHE DISAPPEARED
THEN HE STARTED
UP AND WALKED ABOUT THE LUXEMBOURG GARDEN LIKE A MADMAN
IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT AT TIMES HE LAUGHED TO HIMSELF AND TALKED ALOUD
HE WAS SO DREAMY
WHEN HE CAME NEAR THE CHILDREN'S NURSES THAT EACH ONE OF THEM THOUGHT
HIM IN LOVE WITH HER
HE QUITTED THE LUXEMBOURG HOPING TO FIND HER AGAIN IN THE STREET
HE ENCOUNTERED COURFEYRAC UNDER THE ARCADES OF THE ODEON AND SAID TO
HIM COME AND DINE WITH ME THEY WENT OFF TO ROUSSEAU'S AND SPENT
SIX FRANCS
MARIUS ATE LIKE AN OGRE
HE GAVE THE WAITER SIX SOUS
AT
DESSERT HE SAID TO COURFEYRAC
HAVE YOU READ THE PAPER WHAT A FINE
DISCOURSE AUDRY DE PUYRAVEAU DELIVERED
HE WAS DESPERATELY IN LOVE
AFTER DINNER HE SAID TO COURFEYRAC I WILL TREAT YOU TO THE PLAY
THEY WENT TO THE PORTE SAINTE MARTIN TO SEE FREDERICK IN L'AUBERGE DES
ADRETS
MARIUS WAS ENORMOUSLY AMUSED
AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD A REDOUBLED ATTACK OF SHYNESS
ON EMERGING
FROM THE THEATRE HE REFUSED TO LOOK AT THE GARTER OF A MODISTE WHO WAS
STEPPING ACROSS A GUTTER AND COURFEYRAC WHO SAID I SHOULD LIKE TO
PUT THAT WOMAN IN MY COLLECTION ALMOST HORRIFIED HIM
COURFEYRAC INVITED HIM TO BREAKFAST AT THE CAFE VOLTAIRE ON THE
FOLLOWING MORNING
MARIUS WENT THITHER AND ATE EVEN MORE THAN ON THE
PRECEDING EVENING
HE WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL AND VERY MERRY
ONE WOULD
HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVERY OCCASION TO LAUGH
UPROARIOUSLY
HE TENDERLY EMBRACED SOME MAN OR OTHER FROM THE PROVINCES
WHO WAS PRESENTED TO HIM
A CIRCLE OF STUDENTS FORMED ROUND THE TABLE
AND THEY SPOKE OF THE NONSENSE PAID FOR BY THE STATE WHICH WAS UTTERED
FROM THE ROSTRUM IN THE SORBONNE THEN THE CONVERSATION FELL UPON THE
FAULTS AND OMISSIONS IN GUICHERAT'S DICTIONARIES AND GRAMMARS
MARIUS
INTERRUPTED THE DISCUSSION TO EXCLAIM BUT IT IS VERY AGREEABLE ALL
THE SAME TO HAVE THE CROSS
THAT'S QUEER WHISPERED COURFEYRAC TO JEAN PROUVAIRE
NO RESPONDED PROUVAIRE THAT'S SERIOUS
IT WAS SERIOUS IN FACT MARIUS HAD REACHED THAT FIRST VIOLENT AND
CHARMING HOUR WITH WHICH GRAND PASSIONS BEGIN
A GLANCE HAD WROUGHT ALL THIS
WHEN THE MINE IS CHARGED WHEN THE CONFLAGRATION IS READY NOTHING IS
MORE SIMPLE
A GLANCE IS A SPARK
IT WAS ALL OVER WITH HIM
MARIUS LOVED A WOMAN
HIS FATE WAS ENTERING
THE UNKNOWN
THE GLANCE OF WOMEN RESEMBLES CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF WHEELS WHICH ARE
TRANQUIL IN APPEARANCE YET FORMIDABLE
YOU PASS CLOSE TO THEM EVERY
DAY PEACEABLY AND WITH IMPUNITY AND WITHOUT A SUSPICION OF ANYTHING
A
MOMENT ARRIVES WHEN YOU FORGET THAT THE THING IS THERE
YOU GO AND COME
DREAM SPEAK LAUGH
ALL AT ONCE YOU FEEL YOURSELF CLUTCHED ALL IS
OVER
THE WHEELS HOLD YOU FAST THE GLANCE HAS ENSNARED YOU
IT HAS
CAUGHT YOU NO MATTER WHERE OR HOW BY SOME PORTION OF YOUR THOUGHT
WHICH WAS FLUTTERING LOOSE BY SOME DISTRACTION WHICH HAD ATTACKED YOU
YOU ARE LOST
THE WHOLE OF YOU PASSES INTO IT
A CHAIN OF MYSTERIOUS
FORCES TAKES POSSESSION OF YOU
YOU STRUGGLE IN VAIN NO MORE HUMAN
SUCCOR IS POSSIBLE
YOU GO ON FALLING FROM GEARING TO GEARING FROM
AGONY TO AGONY FROM TORTURE TO TORTURE YOU YOUR MIND YOUR FORTUNE
YOUR FUTURE YOUR SOUL AND ACCORDING TO WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE POWER
OF A WICKED CREATURE OR OF A NOBLE HEART YOU WILL NOT ESCAPE FROM THIS
TERRIFYING MACHINE OTHERWISE THAN DISFIGURED WITH SHAME OR TRANSFIGURED
BY PASSION
CHAPTER VII ADVENTURES OF THE LETTER U DELIVERED OVER TO CONJECTURES
ISOLATION DETACHMENT FROM EVERYTHING PRIDE INDEPENDENCE THE TASTE
OF NATURE THE ABSENCE OF DAILY AND MATERIAL ACTIVITY THE LIFE WITHIN
HIMSELF THE SECRET CONFLICTS OF CHASTITY A BENEVOLENT ECSTASY TOWARDS
ALL CREATION HAD PREPARED MARIUS FOR THIS POSSESSION WHICH IS CALLED
PASSION
HIS WORSHIP OF HIS FATHER HAD GRADUALLY BECOME A RELIGION
AND LIKE ALL RELIGIONS IT HAD RETREATED TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS SOUL
SOMETHING WAS REQUIRED IN THE FOREGROUND
LOVE CAME
A FULL MONTH ELAPSED DURING WHICH MARIUS WENT EVERY DAY TO THE
LUXEMBOURG
WHEN THE HOUR ARRIVED NOTHING COULD HOLD HIM BACK HE
IS ON DUTY SAID COURFEYRAC
MARIUS LIVED IN A STATE OF DELIGHT
IT IS
CERTAIN THAT THE YOUNG GIRL DID LOOK AT HIM
HE HAD FINALLY GROWN BOLD AND APPROACHED THE BENCH
STILL HE DID NOT
PASS IN FRONT OF IT ANY MORE IN OBEDIENCE TO THE INSTINCT OF TIMIDITY
AND TO THE INSTINCT OF PRUDENCE COMMON TO LOVERS
HE CONSIDERED IT
BETTER NOT TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE FATHER HE COMBINED HIS
STATIONS BEHIND THE TREES AND THE PEDESTALS OF THE STATUES WITH A
PROFOUND DIPLOMACY SO THAT HE MIGHT BE SEEN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BY THE
YOUNG GIRL AND AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE BY THE OLD GENTLEMAN
SOMETIMES HE
REMAINED MOTIONLESS BY THE HALF HOUR TOGETHER IN THE SHADE OF A LEONIDAS
OR A SPARTACUS HOLDING IN HIS HAND A BOOK ABOVE WHICH HIS EYES GENTLY
RAISED SOUGHT THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL AND SHE ON HER SIDE TURNED HER
CHARMING PROFILE TOWARDS HIM WITH A VAGUE SMILE
WHILE CONVERSING IN THE
MOST NATURAL AND TRANQUIL MANNER IN THE WORLD WITH THE WHITE HAIRED MAN
SHE BENT UPON MARIUS ALL THE REVERIES OF A VIRGINAL AND PASSIONATE EYE
ANCIENT AND TIME HONORED MANOEUVRE WHICH EVE UNDERSTOOD FROM THE VERY
FIRST DAY OF THE WORLD AND WHICH EVERY WOMAN UNDERSTANDS FROM THE VERY
FIRST DAY OF HER LIFE HER MOUTH REPLIED TO ONE AND HER GLANCE REPLIED
TO ANOTHER
IT MUST BE SUPPOSED THAT M
LEBLANC FINALLY NOTICED SOMETHING FOR
OFTEN WHEN MARIUS ARRIVED HE ROSE AND BEGAN TO WALK ABOUT
HE HAD
ABANDONED THEIR ACCUSTOMED PLACE AND HAD ADOPTED THE BENCH BY THE
GLADIATOR NEAR THE OTHER END OF THE WALK AS THOUGH WITH THE OBJECT
OF SEEING WHETHER MARIUS WOULD PURSUE THEM THITHER
MARIUS DID NOT
UNDERSTAND AND COMMITTED THIS ERROR
THE FATHER BEGAN TO GROW
INEXACT AND NO LONGER BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER EVERY DAY
SOMETIMES HE
CAME ALONE
THEN MARIUS DID NOT STAY
ANOTHER BLUNDER
MARIUS PAID NO HEED TO THESE SYMPTOMS
FROM THE PHASE OF TIMIDITY HE
HAD PASSED BY A NATURAL AND FATAL PROGRESS TO THE PHASE OF BLINDNESS
HIS LOVE INCREASED
HE DREAMED OF IT EVERY NIGHT
AND THEN AN
UNEXPECTED BLISS HAD HAPPENED TO HIM OIL ON THE FIRE A REDOUBLING OF
THE SHADOWS OVER HIS EYES
ONE EVENING AT DUSK HE HAD FOUND ON
THE BENCH WHICH M
LEBLANC AND HIS DAUGHTER HAD JUST QUITTED A
HANDKERCHIEF A VERY SIMPLE HANDKERCHIEF WITHOUT EMBROIDERY BUT WHITE
AND FINE AND WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TO EXHALE INEFFABLE PERFUME
HE SEIZED
IT WITH RAPTURE
THIS HANDKERCHIEF WAS MARKED WITH THE LETTERS U
F
MARIUS KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS BEAUTIFUL CHILD NEITHER HER FAMILY
NAME HER CHRISTIAN NAME NOR HER ABODE THESE TWO LETTERS WERE THE FIRST
THING OF HER THAT HE HAD GAINED POSSESSION OF ADORABLE INITIALS UPON
WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO CONSTRUCT HIS SCAFFOLDING
U WAS EVIDENTLY
THE CHRISTIAN NAME
URSULE HE THOUGHT WHAT A DELICIOUS NAME HE
KISSED THE HANDKERCHIEF DRANK IT IN PLACED IT ON HIS HEART ON HIS
FLESH DURING THE DAY AND AT NIGHT LAID IT BENEATH HIS LIPS THAT HE
MIGHT FALL ASLEEP ON IT
I FEEL THAT HER WHOLE SOUL LIES WITHIN IT HE EXCLAIMED
THIS HANDKERCHIEF BELONGED TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD SIMPLY LET IT
FALL FROM HIS POCKET
IN THE DAYS WHICH FOLLOWED THE FINDING OF THIS TREASURE HE ONLY
DISPLAYED HIMSELF AT THE LUXEMBOURG IN THE ACT OF KISSING THE
HANDKERCHIEF AND LAYING IT ON HIS HEART
THE BEAUTIFUL CHILD UNDERSTOOD
NOTHING OF ALL THIS AND SIGNIFIED IT TO HIM BY IMPERCEPTIBLE SIGNS
O MODESTY SAID MARIUS
CHAPTER VIII THE VETERANS THEMSELVES CAN BE HAPPY
SINCE WE HAVE PRONOUNCED THE WORD MODESTY AND SINCE WE CONCEAL NOTHING
WE OUGHT TO SAY THAT ONCE NEVERTHELESS IN SPITE OF HIS ECSTASIES HIS
URSULE CAUSED HIM VERY SERIOUS GRIEF
IT WAS ON ONE OF THE DAYS WHEN
SHE PERSUADED M
LEBLANC TO LEAVE THE BENCH AND STROLL ALONG THE WALK
A BRISK MAY BREEZE WAS BLOWING WHICH SWAYED THE CRESTS OF THE
PLAINTAIN TREES
THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER ARM IN ARM HAD JUST PASSED
MARIUS' BENCH
MARIUS HAD RISEN TO HIS FEET BEHIND THEM AND WAS
FOLLOWING THEM WITH HIS EYES AS WAS FITTING IN THE DESPERATE SITUATION
OF HIS SOUL
ALL AT ONCE A GUST OF WIND MORE MERRY THAN THE REST AND PROBABLY
CHARGED WITH PERFORMING THE AFFAIRS OF SPRINGTIME SWEPT DOWN FROM
THE NURSERY FLUNG ITSELF ON THE ALLEY ENVELOPED THE YOUNG GIRL IN
A DELICIOUS SHIVER WORTHY OF VIRGIL'S NYMPHS AND THE FAWNS OF
THEOCRITUS AND LIFTED HER DRESS THE ROBE MORE SACRED THAN THAT OF
ISIS ALMOST TO THE HEIGHT OF HER GARTER
A LEG OF EXQUISITE SHAPE
APPEARED
MARIUS SAW IT
HE WAS EXASPERATED AND FURIOUS
THE YOUNG GIRL HAD HASTILY THRUST DOWN HER DRESS WITH A DIVINELY
TROUBLED MOTION BUT HE WAS NONE THE LESS ANGRY FOR ALL THAT
HE WAS
ALONE IN THE ALLEY IT IS TRUE
BUT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME ONE
THERE
AND WHAT IF THERE HAD BEEN SOME ONE THERE CAN ANY ONE COMPREHEND
SUCH A THING WHAT SHE HAD JUST DONE IS HORRIBLE ALAS THE POOR CHILD
HAD DONE NOTHING THERE HAD BEEN BUT ONE CULPRIT THE WIND BUT MARIUS
IN WHOM QUIVERED THE BARTHOLO WHO EXISTS IN CHERUBIN WAS DETERMINED TO
BE VEXED AND WAS JEALOUS OF HIS OWN SHADOW
IT IS THUS IN FACT THAT
THE HARSH AND CAPRICIOUS JEALOUSY OF THE FLESH AWAKENS IN THE HUMAN
HEART AND TAKES POSSESSION OF IT EVEN WITHOUT ANY RIGHT
MOREOVER
SETTING ASIDE EVEN THAT JEALOUSY THE SIGHT OF THAT CHARMING LEG HAD
CONTAINED NOTHING AGREEABLE FOR HIM THE WHITE STOCKING OF THE FIRST
WOMAN HE CHANCED TO MEET WOULD HAVE AFFORDED HIM MORE PLEASURE
WHEN HIS URSULE AFTER HAVING REACHED THE END OF THE WALK RETRACED
HER STEPS WITH M
LEBLANC AND PASSED IN FRONT OF THE BENCH ON WHICH
MARIUS HAD SEATED HIMSELF ONCE MORE MARIUS DARTED A SULLEN AND
FEROCIOUS GLANCE AT HER
THE YOUNG GIRL GAVE WAY TO THAT SLIGHT
STRAIGHTENING UP WITH A BACKWARD MOVEMENT ACCOMPANIED BY A RAISING OF
THE EYELIDS WHICH SIGNIFIES WELL WHAT IS THE MATTER
THIS WAS THEIR FIRST QUARREL
MARIUS HAD HARDLY MADE THIS SCENE AT HER WITH HIS EYES WHEN SOME ONE
CROSSED THE WALK
IT WAS A VETERAN VERY MUCH BENT EXTREMELY WRINKLED
AND PALE IN A UNIFORM OF THE LOUIS XV
PATTERN BEARING ON HIS BREAST
THE LITTLE OVAL PLAQUE OF RED CLOTH WITH THE CROSSED SWORDS THE
SOLDIER'S CROSS OF SAINT LOUIS AND ADORNED IN ADDITION WITH A
COAT SLEEVE WHICH HAD NO ARM WITHIN IT WITH A SILVER CHIN AND A WOODEN
LEG
MARIUS THOUGHT HE PERCEIVED THAT THIS MAN HAD AN EXTREMELY WELL
SATISFIED AIR
IT EVEN STRUCK HIM THAT THE AGED CYNIC AS HE HOBBLED
ALONG PAST HIM ADDRESSED TO HIM A VERY FRATERNAL AND VERY MERRY WINK
AS THOUGH SOME CHANCE HAD CREATED AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM AND AS
THOUGH THEY HAD SHARED SOME PIECE OF GOOD LUCK TOGETHER
WHAT DID THAT
RELIC OF MARS MEAN BY BEING SO CONTENTED WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN
THAT WOODEN LEG AND THE OTHER MARIUS REACHED A PAROXYSM OF
JEALOUSY PERHAPS HE WAS THERE HE SAID TO HIMSELF PERHAPS HE
SAW AND HE FELT A DESIRE TO EXTERMINATE THE VETERAN
WITH THE AID OF TIME ALL POINTS GROW DULL
MARIUS' WRATH AGAINST
URSULE JUST AND LEGITIMATE AS IT WAS PASSED OFF
HE FINALLY PARDONED
HER BUT THIS COST HIM A GREAT EFFORT HE SULKED FOR THREE DAYS
NEVERTHELESS IN SPITE OF ALL THIS AND BECAUSE OF ALL THIS HIS PASSION
AUGMENTED AND GREW TO MADNESS
CHAPTER IX ECLIPSE
THE READER HAS JUST SEEN HOW MARIUS DISCOVERED OR THOUGHT THAT HE
DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS NAMED URSULE
APPETITE GROWS WITH LOVING
TO KNOW THAT HER NAME WAS URSULE WAS A GREAT
DEAL IT WAS VERY LITTLE
IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS MARIUS HAD DEVOURED
THIS BLISS
HE WANTED ANOTHER
HE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE SHE LIVED
HE HAD COMMITTED HIS FIRST BLUNDER BY FALLING INTO THE AMBUSH OF THE
BENCH BY THE GLADIATOR
HE HAD COMMITTED A SECOND BY NOT REMAINING AT
THE LUXEMBOURG WHEN M
LEBLANC CAME THITHER ALONE
HE NOW COMMITTED A
THIRD AND AN IMMENSE ONE
HE FOLLOWED URSULE
SHE LIVED IN THE RUE DE L'OUEST IN THE MOST UNFREQUENTED SPOT IN A
NEW THREE STORY HOUSE OF MODEST APPEARANCE
FROM THAT MOMENT FORTH MARIUS ADDED TO HIS HAPPINESS OF SEEING HER AT
THE LUXEMBOURG THE HAPPINESS OF FOLLOWING HER HOME
HIS HUNGER WAS INCREASING
HE KNEW HER FIRST NAME AT LEAST A CHARMING
NAME A GENUINE WOMAN'S NAME HE KNEW WHERE SHE LIVED HE WANTED TO KNOW
WHO SHE WAS
ONE EVENING AFTER HE HAD FOLLOWED THEM TO THEIR DWELLING AND HAD SEEN
THEM DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE CARRIAGE GATE HE ENTERED IN THEIR TRAIN AND
SAID BOLDLY TO THE PORTER
IS THAT THE GENTLEMAN WHO LIVES ON THE FIRST FLOOR WHO HAS JUST COME
IN
NO REPLIED THE PORTER
HE IS THE GENTLEMAN ON THE THIRD FLOOR
ANOTHER STEP GAINED
THIS SUCCESS EMBOLDENED MARIUS
ON THE FRONT HE ASKED
PARBLEU SAID THE PORTER THE HOUSE IS ONLY BUILT ON THE STREET
AND WHAT IS THAT GENTLEMAN'S BUSINESS BEGAN MARIUS AGAIN
HE IS A GENTLEMAN OF PROPERTY SIR
A VERY KIND MAN WHO DOES GOOD TO
THE UNFORTUNATE THOUGH NOT RICH HIMSELF
WHAT IS HIS NAME RESUMED MARIUS
THE PORTER RAISED HIS HEAD AND SAID
ARE YOU A POLICE SPY SIR
MARIUS WENT OFF QUITE ABASHED BUT DELIGHTED
HE WAS GETTING ON
GOOD THOUGHT HE I KNOW THAT HER NAME IS URSULE THAT SHE IS THE
DAUGHTER OF A GENTLEMAN WHO LIVES ON HIS INCOME AND THAT SHE LIVES
THERE ON THE THIRD FLOOR IN THE RUE DE L'OUEST
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY M
LEBLANC AND HIS DAUGHTER MADE ONLY A VERY
BRIEF STAY IN THE LUXEMBOURG THEY WENT AWAY WHILE IT WAS STILL BROAD
DAYLIGHT
MARIUS FOLLOWED THEM TO THE RUE DE L'OUEST AS HE HAD TAKEN UP
THE HABIT OF DOING
ON ARRIVING AT THE CARRIAGE ENTRANCE M
LEBLANC MADE
HIS DAUGHTER PASS IN FIRST THEN PAUSED BEFORE CROSSING THE THRESHOLD
AND STARED INTENTLY AT MARIUS
ON THE NEXT DAY THEY DID NOT COME TO THE LUXEMBOURG
MARIUS WAITED FOR
THEM ALL DAY IN VAIN
AT NIGHTFALL HE WENT TO THE RUE DE L'OUEST AND SAW A LIGHT IN THE
WINDOWS OF THE THIRD STORY
HE WALKED ABOUT BENEATH THE WINDOWS UNTIL THE LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED
THE NEXT DAY NO ONE AT THE LUXEMBOURG
MARIUS WAITED ALL DAY THEN WENT
AND DID SENTINEL DUTY UNDER THEIR WINDOWS
THIS CARRIED HIM ON TO TEN
O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
HIS DINNER TOOK CARE OF ITSELF
FEVER NOURISHES THE SICK MAN AND LOVE
THE LOVER
HE SPENT A WEEK IN THIS MANNER
M
LEBLANC NO LONGER APPEARED AT THE
LUXEMBOURG
MARIUS INDULGED IN MELANCHOLY CONJECTURES HE DARED NOT WATCH THE PORTE
COCHERE DURING THE DAY HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH GOING AT NIGHT TO GAZE
UPON THE RED LIGHT OF THE WINDOWS
AT TIMES HE SAW SHADOWS FLIT ACROSS
THEM AND HIS HEART BEGAN TO BEAT
ON THE EIGHTH DAY WHEN HE ARRIVED UNDER THE WINDOWS THERE WAS NO LIGHT
IN THEM
HELLO HE SAID THE LAMP IS NOT LIGHTED YET
BUT IT IS DARK
CAN THEY
HAVE GONE OUT HE WAITED UNTIL TEN O'CLOCK
UNTIL MIDNIGHT
UNTIL ONE
IN THE MORNING
NOT A LIGHT APPEARED IN THE WINDOWS OF THE THIRD STORY
AND NO ONE ENTERED THE HOUSE
HE WENT AWAY IN A VERY GLOOMY FRAME OF MIND
ON THE MORROW FOR HE ONLY EXISTED FROM MORROW TO MORROW THERE WAS
SO TO SPEAK NO TO DAY FOR HIM ON THE MORROW HE FOUND NO ONE AT THE
LUXEMBOURG HE HAD EXPECTED THIS
AT DUSK HE WENT TO THE HOUSE
NO LIGHT IN THE WINDOWS THE SHADES WERE DRAWN THE THIRD FLOOR WAS
TOTALLY DARK
MARIUS RAPPED AT THE PORTE COCHERE ENTERED AND SAID TO THE PORTER
THE GENTLEMAN ON THE THIRD FLOOR
HAS MOVED AWAY REPLIED THE PORTER
MARIUS REELED AND SAID FEEBLY
HOW LONG AGO
YESTERDAY
WHERE IS HE LIVING NOW
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
SO HE HAS NOT LEFT HIS NEW ADDRESS
NO
AND THE PORTER RAISING HIS EYES RECOGNIZED MARIUS
COME SO IT'S YOU SAID HE BUT YOU ARE DECIDEDLY A SPY THEN
BOOK SEVENTH PATRON MINETTE
CHAPTER I MINES AND MINERS
HUMAN SOCIETIES ALL HAVE WHAT IS CALLED IN THEATRICAL PARLANCE A THIRD
LOWER FLOOR
THE SOCIAL SOIL IS EVERYWHERE UNDERMINED SOMETIMES FOR
GOOD SOMETIMES FOR EVIL
THESE WORKS ARE SUPERPOSED ONE UPON THE OTHER
THERE ARE SUPERIOR MINES AND INFERIOR MINES
THERE IS A TOP AND A
BOTTOM IN THIS OBSCURE SUB SOIL WHICH SOMETIMES GIVES WAY BENEATH
CIVILIZATION AND WHICH OUR INDIFFERENCE AND HEEDLESSNESS TRAMPLE UNDER
FOOT
THE ENCYCLOPEDIA IN THE LAST CENTURY WAS A MINE THAT WAS
ALMOST OPEN TO THE SKY
THE SHADES THOSE SOMBRE HATCHERS OF PRIMITIVE
CHRISTIANITY ONLY AWAITED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING ABOUT AN EXPLOSION
UNDER THE CAESARS AND TO INUNDATE THE HUMAN RACE WITH LIGHT
FOR IN THE
SACRED SHADOWS THERE LIES LATENT LIGHT
VOLCANOES ARE FULL OF A SHADOW
THAT IS CAPABLE OF FLASHING FORTH
EVERY FORM BEGINS BY BEING NIGHT
THE
CATACOMBS IN WHICH THE FIRST MASS WAS SAID WERE NOT ALONE THE CELLAR
OF ROME THEY WERE THE VAULTS OF THE WORLD
BENEATH THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION THAT COMPLICATED MARVEL OF A STRUCTURE
THERE ARE EXCAVATIONS OF ALL SORTS
THERE IS THE RELIGIOUS MINE THE
PHILOSOPHICAL MINE THE ECONOMIC MINE THE REVOLUTIONARY MINE
SUCH AND
SUCH A PICK AXE WITH THE IDEA SUCH A PICK WITH CIPHERS
SUCH ANOTHER

CALVIN SEIZES SOCINIUS

BUT NOTHING ARRESTS NOR INTERRUPTS THE TENSION OF ALL THESE
ENERGIES TOWARD THE GOAL AND THE VAST SIMULTANEOUS ACTIVITY WHICH
GOES AND COMES MOUNTS DESCENDS AND MOUNTS AGAIN IN THESE OBSCURITIES
AND WHICH IMMENSE UNKNOWN SWARMING SLOWLY TRANSFORMS THE TOP AND THE
BOTTOM AND THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE
SOCIETY HARDLY EVEN SUSPECTS THIS
DIGGING WHICH LEAVES ITS SURFACE INTACT AND CHANGES ITS BOWELS
THERE
ARE AS MANY DIFFERENT SUBTERRANEAN STAGES AS THERE ARE VARYING WORKS
AS THERE ARE EXTRACTIONS
WHAT EMERGES FROM THESE DEEP EXCAVATIONS THE
FUTURE
THE DEEPER ONE GOES THE MORE MYSTERIOUS ARE THE TOILERS
THE WORK
IS GOOD UP TO A DEGREE WHICH THE SOCIAL PHILOSOPHIES ARE ABLE TO
RECOGNIZE BEYOND THAT DEGREE IT IS DOUBTFUL AND MIXED LOWER DOWN
IT BECOMES TERRIBLE
AT A CERTAIN DEPTH THE EXCAVATIONS ARE NO LONGER
PENETRABLE BY THE SPIRIT OF CIVILIZATION THE LIMIT BREATHABLE BY MAN
HAS BEEN PASSED A BEGINNING OF MONSTERS IS POSSIBLE
THE DESCENDING SCALE IS A STRANGE ONE AND EACH ONE OF THE RUNGS OF THIS
LADDER CORRESPONDS TO A STAGE WHERE PHILOSOPHY CAN FIND FOOTHOLD AND
WHERE ONE ENCOUNTERS ONE OF THESE WORKMEN SOMETIMES DIVINE SOMETIMES
MISSHAPEN
BELOW JOHN HUSS THERE IS LUTHER BELOW LUTHER THERE IS
DESCARTES BELOW DESCARTES THERE IS VOLTAIRE BELOW VOLTAIRE THERE
IS CONDORCET BELOW CONDORCET THERE IS ROBESPIERRE BELOW ROBESPIERRE
THERE IS MARAT BELOW MARAT THERE IS BABEUF
AND SO IT GOES ON
LOWER
DOWN CONFUSEDLY AT THE LIMIT WHICH SEPARATES THE INDISTINCT FROM THE
INVISIBLE ONE PERCEIVES OTHER GLOOMY MEN WHO PERHAPS DO NOT EXIST AS

THE MEN OF YESTERDAY ARE SPECTRES THOSE OF TO MORROW ARE FORMS
THE EYE OF THE SPIRIT DISTINGUISHES THEM BUT OBSCURELY

IS IT DISINTERESTEDNESS
MARAT FORGETS HIMSELF LIKE JESUS
THEY
THROW THEMSELVES ON ONE SIDE THEY OMIT THEMSELVES THEY THINK NOT OF
THEMSELVES
THEY HAVE A GLANCE AND THAT GLANCE SEEKS THE ABSOLUTE
THE
FIRST HAS THE WHOLE HEAVENS IN HIS EYES THE LAST ENIGMATICAL THOUGH HE
MAY BE HAS STILL BENEATH HIS EYELIDS THE PALE BEAM OF THE INFINITE
VENERATE THE MAN WHOEVER HE MAY BE WHO HAS THIS SIGN THE STARRY EYE
THE SHADOWY EYE IS THE OTHER SIGN
WITH IT EVIL COMMENCES
REFLECT AND TREMBLE IN THE PRESENCE OF ANY ONE
WHO HAS NO GLANCE AT ALL
THE SOCIAL ORDER HAS ITS BLACK MINERS
THERE IS A POINT WHERE DEPTH IS TANTAMOUNT TO BURIAL AND WHERE LIGHT
BECOMES EXTINCT
BELOW ALL THESE MINES WHICH WE HAVE JUST MENTIONED BELOW ALL THESE
GALLERIES BELOW THIS WHOLE IMMENSE SUBTERRANEAN VENOUS SYSTEM OF
PROGRESS AND UTOPIA MUCH FURTHER ON IN THE EARTH MUCH LOWER THAN
MARAT LOWER THAN BABEUF LOWER MUCH LOWER AND WITHOUT ANY CONNECTION
WITH THE UPPER LEVELS THERE LIES THE LAST MINE
A FORMIDABLE SPOT
THIS
IS WHAT WE HAVE DESIGNATED AS THE LE TROISIEME DESSOUS
IT IS THE GRAVE
OF SHADOWS
IT IS THE CELLAR OF THE BLIND
INFERI
THIS COMMUNICATES WITH THE ABYSS
CHAPTER II THE LOWEST DEPTHS
THERE DISINTERESTEDNESS VANISHES
THE DEMON IS VAGUELY OUTLINED EACH
ONE IS FOR HIMSELF
THE I IN THE EYES HOWLS SEEKS FUMBLES AND
GNAWS
THE SOCIAL UGOLINO IS IN THIS GULF
THE WILD SPECTRES WHO ROAM IN THIS GRAVE ALMOST BEASTS ALMOST
PHANTOMS ARE NOT OCCUPIED WITH UNIVERSAL PROGRESS THEY ARE IGNORANT
BOTH OF THE IDEA AND OF THE WORD THEY TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR ANYTHING
BUT THE SATISFACTION OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL DESIRES
THEY ARE ALMOST
UNCONSCIOUS AND THERE EXISTS WITHIN THEM A SORT OF TERRIBLE
OBLITERATION
THEY HAVE TWO MOTHERS BOTH STEP MOTHERS IGNORANCE AND
MISERY
THEY HAVE A GUIDE NECESSITY AND FOR ALL FORMS OF SATISFACTION
APPETITE
THEY ARE BRUTALLY VORACIOUS THAT IS TO SAY FEROCIOUS NOT
AFTER THE FASHION OF THE TYRANT BUT AFTER THE FASHION OF THE TIGER
FROM SUFFERING THESE SPECTRES PASS TO CRIME FATAL AFFILIATION DIZZY
CREATION LOGIC OF DARKNESS
THAT WHICH CRAWLS IN THE SOCIAL THIRD LOWER
LEVEL IS NO LONGER COMPLAINT STIFLED BY THE ABSOLUTE IT IS THE PROTEST
OF MATTER
MAN THERE BECOMES A DRAGON
TO BE HUNGRY TO BE THIRSTY THAT
IS THE POINT OF DEPARTURE TO BE SATAN THAT IS THE POINT REACHED
FROM
THAT VAULT LACENAIRE EMERGES
WE HAVE JUST SEEN IN BOOK FOURTH ONE OF THE COMPARTMENTS OF THE
UPPER MINE OF THE GREAT POLITICAL REVOLUTIONARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL
EXCAVATION
THERE AS WE HAVE JUST SAID ALL IS PURE NOBLE DIGNIFIED
HONEST
THERE ASSUREDLY ONE MIGHT BE MISLED BUT ERROR IS WORTHY OF
VENERATION THERE SO THOROUGHLY DOES IT IMPLY HEROISM
THE WORK THERE
EFFECTED TAKEN AS A WHOLE HAS A NAME PROGRESS
THE MOMENT HAS NOW COME WHEN WE MUST TAKE A LOOK AT OTHER DEPTHS
HIDEOUS DEPTHS
THERE EXISTS BENEATH SOCIETY WE INSIST UPON THIS POINT
AND THERE WILL EXIST UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN IGNORANCE SHALL BE DISSIPATED
THE GREAT CAVERN OF EVIL
THIS CAVERN IS BELOW ALL AND IS THE FOE OF ALL
IT IS HATRED WITHOUT
EXCEPTION
THIS CAVERN KNOWS NO PHILOSOPHERS ITS DAGGER HAS NEVER CUT
A PEN
ITS BLACKNESS HAS NO CONNECTION WITH THE SUBLIME BLACKNESS OF THE
INKSTAND
NEVER HAVE THE FINGERS OF NIGHT WHICH CONTRACT BENEATH THIS
STIFLING CEILING TURNED THE LEAVES OF A BOOK NOR UNFOLDED A NEWSPAPER
BABEUF IS A SPECULATOR TO CARTOUCHE MARAT IS AN ARISTOCRAT TO
SCHINDERHANNES
THIS CAVERN HAS FOR ITS OBJECT THE DESTRUCTION OF
EVERYTHING
OF EVERYTHING
INCLUDING THE UPPER SUPERIOR MINES WHICH IT EXECRATES
IT NOT ONLY UNDERMINES IN ITS HIDEOUS SWARMING THE ACTUAL SOCIAL
ORDER IT UNDERMINES PHILOSOPHY IT UNDERMINES HUMAN THOUGHT IT
UNDERMINES CIVILIZATION IT UNDERMINES REVOLUTION IT UNDERMINES
PROGRESS
ITS NAME IS SIMPLY THEFT PROSTITUTION MURDER ASSASSINATION
IT IS DARKNESS AND IT DESIRES CHAOS
ITS VAULT IS FORMED OF IGNORANCE
ALL THE OTHERS THOSE ABOVE IT HAVE BUT ONE OBJECT TO SUPPRESS IT
IT IS TO THIS POINT THAT PHILOSOPHY AND PROGRESS TEND WITH ALL THEIR
ORGANS SIMULTANEOUSLY BY THEIR AMELIORATION OF THE REAL AS WELL AS BY
THEIR CONTEMPLATION OF THE ABSOLUTE
DESTROY THE CAVERN IGNORANCE AND
YOU DESTROY THE LAIR CRIME
LET US CONDENSE IN A FEW WORDS A PART OF WHAT WE HAVE JUST WRITTEN
THE ONLY SOCIAL PERIL IS DARKNESS
HUMANITY IS IDENTITY
ALL MEN ARE MADE OF THE SAME CLAY
THERE IS NO
DIFFERENCE HERE BELOW AT LEAST IN PREDESTINATION
THE SAME SHADOW
IN FRONT THE SAME FLESH IN THE PRESENT THE SAME ASHES AFTERWARDS
BUT
IGNORANCE MINGLED WITH THE HUMAN PASTE BLACKENS IT
THIS INCURABLE
BLACKNESS TAKES POSSESSION OF THE INTERIOR OF A MAN AND IS THERE
CONVERTED INTO EVIL
CHAPTER III BABET GUEULEMER CLAQUESOUS AND MONTPARNASSE
A QUARTETTE OF RUFFIANS CLAQUESOUS GUEULEMER BABET AND MONTPARNASSE
GOVERNED THE THIRD LOWER FLOOR OF PARIS FROM 1830 TO 1835
GUEULEMER WAS A HERCULES OF NO DEFINED POSITION
FOR HIS LAIR HE HAD THE
SEWER OF THE ARCHE MARION
HE WAS SIX FEET HIGH HIS PECTORAL MUSCLES
WERE OF MARBLE HIS BICEPS OF BRASS HIS BREATH WAS THAT OF A CAVERN
HIS TORSO THAT OF A COLOSSUS HIS HEAD THAT OF A BIRD
ONE THOUGHT ONE
BEHELD THE FARNESE HERCULES CLAD IN DUCK TROUSERS AND A COTTON VELVET
WAISTCOAT
GUEULEMER BUILT AFTER THIS SCULPTURAL FASHION MIGHT HAVE
SUBDUED MONSTERS HE HAD FOUND IT MORE EXPEDITIOUS TO BE ONE
A LOW
BROW LARGE TEMPLES LESS THAN FORTY YEARS OF AGE BUT WITH CROW'S FEET
HARSH SHORT HAIR CHEEKS LIKE A BRUSH A BEARD LIKE THAT OF A WILD
BOAR THE READER CAN SEE THE MAN BEFORE HIM
HIS MUSCLES CALLED FOR
WORK HIS STUPIDITY WOULD HAVE NONE OF IT
HE WAS A GREAT IDLE FORCE
HE WAS AN ASSASSIN THROUGH COOLNESS
HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE A CREOLE
HE
HAD PROBABLY SOMEWHAT TO DO WITH MARSHAL BRUNE HAVING BEEN A PORTER
AT AVIGNON IN 1815
AFTER THIS STAGE HE HAD TURNED RUFFIAN
THE DIAPHANEITY OF BABET CONTRASTED WITH THE GROSSNESS OF GUEULEMER
BABET WAS THIN AND LEARNED
HE WAS TRANSPARENT BUT IMPENETRABLE
DAYLIGHT WAS VISIBLE THROUGH HIS BONES BUT NOTHING THROUGH HIS EYES
HE
DECLARED THAT HE WAS A CHEMIST
HE HAD BEEN A JACK OF ALL TRADES
HE HAD
PLAYED IN VAUDEVILLE AT SAINT MIHIEL
HE WAS A MAN OF PURPOSE A FINE
TALKER WHO UNDERLINED HIS SMILES AND ACCENTUATED HIS GESTURES
HIS
OCCUPATION CONSISTED IN SELLING IN THE OPEN AIR PLASTER BUSTS AND
PORTRAITS OF THE HEAD OF THE STATE IN ADDITION TO THIS HE EXTRACTED
TEETH
HE HAD EXHIBITED PHENOMENA AT FAIRS AND HE HAD OWNED A BOOTH
WITH A TRUMPET AND THIS POSTER BABET DENTAL ARTIST MEMBER OF THE
ACADEMIES MAKES PHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS ON METALS AND METALLOIDS EXTRACTS
TEETH UNDERTAKES STUMPS ABANDONED BY HIS BROTHER PRACTITIONERS
PRICE
ONE TOOTH ONE FRANC FIFTY CENTIMES TWO TEETH TWO FRANCS THREE
TEETH TWO FRANCS FIFTY
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY THIS TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY MEANT HAVE AS MANY TEETH EXTRACTED AS
POSSIBLE
HE HAD BEEN MARRIED AND HAD HAD CHILDREN
HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT
HAD BECOME OF HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
HE HAD LOST THEM AS ONE LOSES HIS
HANDKERCHIEF
BABET READ THE PAPERS A STRIKING EXCEPTION IN THE WORLD
TO WHICH HE BELONGED
ONE DAY AT THE PERIOD WHEN HE HAD HIS FAMILY WITH
HIM IN HIS BOOTH ON WHEELS HE HAD READ IN THE MESSAGER THAT A WOMAN
HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH TO A CHILD WHO WAS DOING WELL AND HAD A CALF'S
MUZZLE AND HE EXCLAIMED THERE'S A FORTUNE MY WIFE HAS NOT THE WIT TO
PRESENT ME WITH A CHILD LIKE THAT
LATER ON HE HAD ABANDONED EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO UNDERTAKE PARIS
THIS WAS HIS EXPRESSION
WHO WAS CLAQUESOUS HE WAS NIGHT
HE WAITED UNTIL THE SKY WAS DAUBED
WITH BLACK BEFORE HE SHOWED HIMSELF
AT NIGHTFALL HE EMERGED FROM THE
HOLE WHITHER HE RETURNED BEFORE DAYLIGHT
WHERE WAS THIS HOLE NO ONE
KNEW
HE ONLY ADDRESSED HIS ACCOMPLICES IN THE MOST ABSOLUTE DARKNESS
AND WITH HIS BACK TURNED TO THEM
WAS HIS NAME CLAQUESOUS CERTAINLY
NOT
IF A CANDLE WAS BROUGHT HE PUT ON A MASK
HE WAS A VENTRILOQUIST
BABET SAID CLAQUESOUS IS A NOCTURNE FOR TWO VOICES CLAQUESOUS WAS
VAGUE TERRIBLE AND A ROAMER
NO ONE WAS SURE WHETHER HE HAD A NAME
CLAQUESOUS BEING A SOBRIQUET NONE WAS SURE THAT HE HAD A VOICE AS HIS
STOMACH SPOKE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN HIS VOICE NO ONE WAS SURE THAT HE
HAD A FACE AS HE WAS NEVER SEEN WITHOUT HIS MASK
HE DISAPPEARED AS
THOUGH HE HAD VANISHED INTO THIN AIR WHEN HE APPEARED IT WAS AS THOUGH
HE SPRANG FROM THE EARTH
A LUGUBRIOUS BEING WAS MONTPARNASSE
MONTPARNASSE WAS A CHILD LESS THAN
TWENTY YEARS OF AGE WITH A HANDSOME FACE LIPS LIKE CHERRIES CHARMING
BLACK HAIR THE BRILLIANT LIGHT OF SPRINGTIME IN HIS EYES HE HAD ALL
VICES AND ASPIRED TO ALL CRIMES
THE DIGESTION OF EVIL AROUSED IN HIM AN APPETITE FOR WORSE
IT WAS THE
STREET BOY TURNED PICKPOCKET AND A PICKPOCKET TURNED GARROTER
HE WAS
GENTEEL EFFEMINATE GRACEFUL ROBUST SLUGGISH FEROCIOUS
THE RIM OF
HIS HAT WAS CURLED UP ON THE LEFT SIDE IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOM FOR A TUFT
OF HAIR AFTER THE STYLE OF 1829
HE LIVED BY ROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE
HIS COAT WAS OF THE BEST CUT BUT THREADBARE
MONTPARNASSE WAS A
FASHION PLATE IN MISERY AND GIVEN TO THE COMMISSION OF MURDERS
THE
CAUSE OF ALL THIS YOUTH'S CRIMES WAS THE DESIRE TO BE WELL DRESSED
THE
FIRST GRISETTE WHO HAD SAID TO HIM YOU ARE HANDSOME HAD CAST THE
STAIN OF DARKNESS INTO HIS HEART AND HAD MADE A CAIN OF THIS ABEL
FINDING THAT HE WAS HANDSOME HE DESIRED TO BE ELEGANT NOW THE
HEIGHT OF ELEGANCE IS IDLENESS IDLENESS IN A POOR MAN MEANS CRIME
FEW
PROWLERS WERE SO DREADED AS MONTPARNASSE
AT EIGHTEEN HE HAD ALREADY
NUMEROUS CORPSES IN HIS PAST
MORE THAN ONE PASSER BY LAY WITH
OUTSTRETCHED ARMS IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS WRETCH WITH HIS FACE IN A
POOL OF BLOOD
CURLED POMADED WITH LACED WAIST THE HIPS OF A WOMAN
THE BUST OF A PRUSSIAN OFFICER THE MURMUR OF ADMIRATION FROM THE
BOULEVARD WENCHES SURROUNDING HIM HIS CRAVAT KNOWINGLY TIED A BLUDGEON
IN HIS POCKET A FLOWER IN HIS BUTTONHOLE SUCH WAS THIS DANDY OF THE
SEPULCHRE
CHAPTER IV COMPOSITION OF THE TROUPE
THESE FOUR RUFFIANS FORMED A SORT OF PROTEUS WINDING LIKE A SERPENT
AMONG THE POLICE AND STRIVING TO ESCAPE VIDOCQ'S INDISCREET GLANCES
UNDER DIVERS FORMS TREE FLAME FOUNTAIN LENDING EACH OTHER THEIR
NAMES AND THEIR TRAPS HIDING IN THEIR OWN SHADOWS BOXES WITH
SECRET COMPARTMENTS AND REFUGES FOR EACH OTHER STRIPPING OFF THEIR
PERSONALITIES AS ONE REMOVES HIS FALSE NOSE AT A MASKED BALL SOMETIMES
SIMPLIFYING MATTERS TO THE POINT OF CONSISTING OF BUT ONE INDIVIDUAL
SOMETIMES MULTIPLYING THEMSELVES TO SUCH A POINT THAT COCO LATOUR
HIMSELF TOOK THEM FOR A WHOLE THRONG
THESE FOUR MEN WERE NOT FOUR MEN THEY WERE A SORT OF MYSTERIOUS ROBBER
WITH FOUR HEADS OPERATING ON A GRAND SCALE ON PARIS THEY WERE THAT
MONSTROUS POLYP OF EVIL WHICH INHABITS THE CRYPT OF SOCIETY
THANKS TO THEIR RAMIFICATIONS AND TO THE NETWORK UNDERLYING THEIR
RELATIONS BABET GUEULEMER CLAQUESOUS AND MONTPARNASSE WERE CHARGED
WITH THE GENERAL ENTERPRISE OF THE AMBUSHES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
THE SEINE
THE INVENTORS OF IDEAS OF THAT NATURE MEN WITH NOCTURNAL
IMAGINATIONS APPLIED TO THEM TO HAVE THEIR IDEAS EXECUTED
THEY
FURNISHED THE CANVAS TO THE FOUR RASCALS AND THE LATTER UNDERTOOK THE
PREPARATION OF THE SCENERY
THEY LABORED AT THE STAGE SETTING
THEY WERE
ALWAYS IN A CONDITION TO LEND A FORCE PROPORTIONED AND SUITABLE TO
ALL CRIMES WHICH DEMANDED A LIFT OF THE SHOULDER AND WHICH WERE
SUFFICIENTLY LUCRATIVE
WHEN A CRIME WAS IN QUEST OF ARMS THEY
UNDER LET THEIR ACCOMPLICES
THEY KEPT A TROUPE OF ACTORS OF THE SHADOWS
AT THE DISPOSITION OF ALL UNDERGROUND TRAGEDIES
THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF ASSEMBLING AT NIGHTFALL THE HOUR WHEN THEY
WOKE UP ON THE PLAINS WHICH ADJOIN THE SALPETRIERE
THERE THEY HELD
THEIR CONFERENCES
THEY HAD TWELVE BLACK HOURS BEFORE THEM THEY
REGULATED THEIR EMPLOYMENT ACCORDINGLY
PATRON MINETTE SUCH WAS THE NAME WHICH WAS BESTOWED IN THE
SUBTERRANEAN CIRCULATION ON THE ASSOCIATION OF THESE FOUR MEN
IN THE
FANTASTIC ANCIENT POPULAR PARLANCE WHICH IS VANISHING DAY BY DAY
PATRON MINETTE SIGNIFIES THE MORNING THE SAME AS ENTRE CHIEN ET
LOUP BETWEEN DOG AND WOLF SIGNIFIES THE EVENING
THIS APPELLATION
PATRON MINETTE WAS PROBABLY DERIVED FROM THE HOUR AT WHICH THEIR WORK
ENDED THE DAWN BEING THE VANISHING MOMENT FOR PHANTOMS AND FOR THE
SEPARATION OF RUFFIANS
THESE FOUR MEN WERE KNOWN UNDER THIS TITLE
WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSIZES VISITED LACENAIRE IN HIS PRISON AND
QUESTIONED HIM CONCERNING A MISDEED WHICH LACENAIRE DENIED WHO DID
IT DEMANDED THE PRESIDENT
LACENAIRE MADE THIS RESPONSE ENIGMATICAL
SO FAR AS THE MAGISTRATE WAS CONCERNED BUT CLEAR TO THE POLICE
PERHAPS IT WAS PATRON MINETTE
A PIECE CAN SOMETIMES BE DIVINED ON THE ENUNCIATION OF THE PERSONAGES
IN THE SAME MANNER A BAND CAN ALMOST BE JUDGED FROM THE LIST OF RUFFIANS
COMPOSING IT
HERE ARE THE APPELLATIONS TO WHICH THE PRINCIPAL MEMBERS
OF PATRON MINETTE ANSWERED FOR THE NAMES HAVE SURVIVED IN SPECIAL
MEMOIRS
PANCHAUD ALIAS PRINTANIER ALIAS BIGRENAILLE
BRUJON
THERE WAS A BRUJON DYNASTY WE CANNOT REFRAIN FROM
INTERPOLATING THIS WORD

KRUIDENIERS CALLED BIZARRO
MANGEDENTELLE
LACE EATER
LES PIEDS EN L'AIR
FEET IN THE AIR
DEMI LIARD CALLED DEUX MILLIARDS
ETC ETC
WE PASS OVER SOME AND NOT THE WORST OF THEM
THESE NAMES HAVE FACES
ATTACHED
THEY DO NOT EXPRESS MERELY BEINGS BUT SPECIES
EACH ONE OF
THESE NAMES CORRESPONDS TO A VARIETY OF THOSE MISSHAPEN FUNGI FROM THE
UNDER SIDE OF CIVILIZATION
THOSE BEINGS WHO WERE NOT VERY LAVISH WITH THEIR COUNTENANCES WERE NOT
AMONG THE MEN WHOM ONE SEES PASSING ALONG THE STREETS
FATIGUED BY THE
WILD NIGHTS WHICH THEY PASSED THEY WENT OFF BY DAY TO SLEEP SOMETIMES
IN THE LIME KILNS SOMETIMES IN THE ABANDONED QUARRIES OF MONTMATRE OR
MONTROUGE SOMETIMES IN THE SEWERS
THEY RAN TO EARTH
WHAT BECAME OF THESE MEN THEY STILL EXIST
THEY HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED
HORACE SPEAKS OF THEM AMBUBAIARUM COLLEGIA PHARMACOPOLAE MENDICI
MIMAE AND SO LONG AS SOCIETY REMAINS WHAT IT IS THEY WILL REMAIN WHAT
THEY ARE
BENEATH THE OBSCURE ROOF OF THEIR CAVERN THEY ARE CONTINUALLY
BORN AGAIN FROM THE SOCIAL OOZE
THEY RETURN SPECTRES BUT ALWAYS
IDENTICAL ONLY THEY NO LONGER BEAR THE SAME NAMES AND THEY ARE
NO LONGER IN THE SAME SKINS
THE INDIVIDUALS EXTIRPATED THE TRIBE
SUBSISTS
THEY ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME FACULTIES
FROM THE VAGRANT TO THE TRAMP THE
RACE IS MAINTAINED IN ITS PURITY
THEY DIVINE PURSES IN POCKETS THEY
SCENT OUT WATCHES IN FOBS
GOLD AND SILVER POSSESS AN ODOR FOR THEM
THERE EXIST INGENUOUS BOURGEOIS OF WHOM IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT THEY
HAVE A STEALABLE AIR
THESE MEN PATIENTLY PURSUE THESE BOURGEOIS
THEY
EXPERIENCE THE QUIVERS OF A SPIDER AT THE PASSAGE OF A STRANGER OR OF A
MAN FROM THE COUNTRY
THESE MEN ARE TERRIBLE WHEN ONE ENCOUNTERS THEM OR CATCHES A GLIMPSE
OF THEM TOWARDS MIDNIGHT ON A DESERTED BOULEVARD
THEY DO NOT SEEM
TO BE MEN BUT FORMS COMPOSED OF LIVING MISTS ONE WOULD SAY THAT THEY
HABITUALLY CONSTITUTE ONE MASS WITH THE SHADOWS THAT THEY ARE IN
NO WISE DISTINCT FROM THEM THAT THEY POSSESS NO OTHER SOUL THAN THE
DARKNESS AND THAT IT IS ONLY MOMENTARILY AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF LIVING
FOR A FEW MINUTES A MONSTROUS LIFE THAT THEY HAVE SEPARATED FROM THE
NIGHT
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO CAUSE THESE SPECTRES TO VANISH LIGHT
LIGHT IN
FLOODS
NOT A SINGLE BAT CAN RESIST THE DAWN
LIGHT UP SOCIETY FROM

BOOK EIGHTH THE WICKED POOR MAN
CHAPTER I MARIUS WHILE SEEKING A GIRL IN A BONNET ENCOUNTERS A MAN IN
A CAP
SUMMER PASSED THEN THE AUTUMN WINTER CAME
NEITHER M
LEBLANC NOR THE
YOUNG GIRL HAD AGAIN SET FOOT IN THE LUXEMBOURG GARDEN
THENCEFORTH
MARIUS HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT TO GAZE ONCE MORE ON THAT SWEET AND
ADORABLE FACE
HE SOUGHT CONSTANTLY HE SOUGHT EVERYWHERE HE FOUND
NOTHING
HE WAS NO LONGER MARIUS THE ENTHUSIASTIC DREAMER THE FIRM
RESOLUTE ARDENT MAN THE BOLD DEFIER OF FATE THE BRAIN WHICH ERECTED
FUTURE ON FUTURE THE YOUNG SPIRIT ENCUMBERED WITH PLANS WITH PROJECTS
WITH PRIDE WITH IDEAS AND WISHES HE WAS A LOST DOG
HE FELL INTO A
BLACK MELANCHOLY
ALL WAS OVER
WORK DISGUSTED HIM WALKING TIRED HIM
VAST NATURE FORMERLY SO FILLED WITH FORMS LIGHTS VOICES COUNSELS
PERSPECTIVES HORIZONS TEACHINGS NOW LAY EMPTY BEFORE HIM
IT SEEMED
TO HIM THAT EVERYTHING HAD DISAPPEARED
HE THOUGHT INCESSANTLY FOR HE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE BUT HE NO LONGER
TOOK PLEASURE IN HIS THOUGHTS
TO EVERYTHING THAT THEY PROPOSED TO HIM
IN A WHISPER HE REPLIED IN HIS DARKNESS WHAT IS THE USE
HE HEAPED A HUNDRED REPROACHES ON HIMSELF
WHY DID I FOLLOW HER I
WAS SO HAPPY AT THE MERE SIGHT OF HER SHE LOOKED AT ME WAS NOT THAT
IMMENSE SHE HAD THE AIR OF LOVING ME
WAS NOT THAT EVERYTHING I WISHED
TO HAVE WHAT THERE WAS NOTHING AFTER THAT
I HAVE BEEN ABSURD
IT IS
MY OWN FAULT ETC ETC
COURFEYRAC TO WHOM HE CONFIDED NOTHING IT
WAS HIS NATURE BUT WHO MADE SOME LITTLE GUESS AT EVERYTHING THAT WAS
HIS NATURE HAD BEGUN BY CONGRATULATING HIM ON BEING IN LOVE THOUGH HE
WAS AMAZED AT IT THEN SEEING MARIUS FALL INTO THIS MELANCHOLY STATE
HE ENDED BY SAYING TO HIM I SEE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SIMPLY AN ANIMAL
HERE COME TO THE CHAUMIERE
ONCE HAVING CONFIDENCE IN A FINE SEPTEMBER SUN MARIUS HAD ALLOWED
HIMSELF TO BE TAKEN TO THE BALL AT SCEAUX BY COURFEYRAC BOSSUET AND
GRANTAIRE HOPING WHAT A DREAM THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS FIND HER THERE
OF COURSE HE DID NOT SEE THE ONE HE SOUGHT BUT THIS IS THE PLACE
ALL THE SAME WHERE ALL LOST WOMEN ARE FOUND GRUMBLED GRANTAIRE IN AN
ASIDE
MARIUS LEFT HIS FRIENDS AT THE BALL AND RETURNED HOME ON FOOT
ALONE THROUGH THE NIGHT WEARY FEVERISH WITH SAD AND TROUBLED EYES
STUNNED BY THE NOISE AND DUST OF THE MERRY WAGONS FILLED WITH SINGING
CREATURES ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM THE FEAST WHICH PASSED CLOSE TO
HIM AS HE IN HIS DISCOURAGEMENT BREATHED IN THE ACRID SCENT OF THE
WALNUT TREES ALONG THE ROAD IN ORDER TO REFRESH HIS HEAD
HE TOOK TO LIVING MORE AND MORE ALONE UTTERLY OVERWHELMED WHOLLY GIVEN
UP TO HIS INWARD ANGUISH GOING AND COMING IN HIS PAIN LIKE THE WOLF IN
THE TRAP SEEKING THE ABSENT ONE EVERYWHERE STUPEFIED BY LOVE
ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE HAD AN ENCOUNTER WHICH PRODUCED ON HIM A
SINGULAR EFFECT
HE MET IN THE NARROW STREETS IN THE VICINITY OF THE
BOULEVARD DES INVALIDES A MAN DRESSED LIKE A WORKINGMAN AND WEARING A
CAP WITH A LONG VISOR WHICH ALLOWED A GLIMPSE OF LOCKS OF VERY
WHITE HAIR
MARIUS WAS STRUCK WITH THE BEAUTY OF THIS WHITE HAIR AND
SCRUTINIZED THE MAN WHO WAS WALKING SLOWLY AND AS THOUGH ABSORBED IN
PAINFUL MEDITATION
STRANGE TO SAY HE THOUGHT THAT HE RECOGNIZED M
LEBLANC
THE HAIR WAS THE SAME ALSO THE PROFILE SO FAR AS THE CAP
PERMITTED A VIEW OF IT THE MIEN IDENTICAL ONLY MORE DEPRESSED
BUT WHY
THESE WORKINGMAN'S CLOTHES WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THIS WHAT SIGNIFIED
THAT DISGUISE MARIUS WAS GREATLY ASTONISHED
WHEN HE RECOVERED HIMSELF
HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE MAN WHO KNOWS WHETHER HE DID NOT
HOLD AT LAST THE CLUE WHICH HE WAS SEEKING IN ANY CASE HE MUST SEE THE
MAN NEAR AT HAND AND CLEAR UP THE MYSTERY
BUT THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM
TOO LATE THE MAN WAS NO LONGER THERE
HE HAD TURNED INTO SOME LITTLE
SIDE STREET AND MARIUS COULD NOT FIND HIM
THIS ENCOUNTER OCCUPIED
HIS MIND FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN WAS EFFACED
AFTER ALL HE SAID TO
HIMSELF IT WAS PROBABLY ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
CHAPTER II TREASURE TROVE
MARIUS HAD NOT LEFT THE GORBEAU HOUSE
HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANY ONE
THERE
AT THAT EPOCH TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE WERE NO OTHER INHABITANTS IN THE
HOUSE EXCEPT HIMSELF AND THOSE JONDRETTES WHOSE RENT HE HAD ONCE PAID
WITHOUT MOREOVER EVER HAVING SPOKEN TO EITHER FATHER MOTHER OR
DAUGHTERS
THE OTHER LODGERS HAD MOVED AWAY OR HAD DIED OR HAD BEEN
TURNED OUT IN DEFAULT OF PAYMENT
ONE DAY DURING THAT WINTER THE SUN HAD SHOWN ITSELF A LITTLE IN THE
AFTERNOON BUT IT WAS THE 2D OF FEBRUARY THAT ANCIENT CANDLEMAS
DAY WHOSE TREACHEROUS SUN THE PRECURSOR OF A SIX WEEKS' COLD SPELL
INSPIRED MATHIEU LAENSBERG WITH THESE TWO LINES WHICH HAVE WITH JUSTICE
REMAINED CLASSIC
QU'IL LUISE OU QU'IL LUISERNE
L'OURS RENTRE DANS EN SA CAVERNE 26
MARIUS HAD JUST EMERGED FROM HIS NIGHT WAS FALLING
IT WAS THE HOUR FOR
HIS DINNER FOR HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE TO DINING AGAIN ALAS OH
INFIRMITIES OF IDEAL PASSIONS
HE HAD JUST CROSSED HIS THRESHOLD WHERE MA'AM BOUGON WAS SWEEPING AT
THE MOMENT AS SHE UTTERED THIS MEMORABLE MONOLOGUE
WHAT IS THERE THAT IS CHEAP NOW EVERYTHING IS DEAR
THERE IS NOTHING
IN THE WORLD THAT IS CHEAP EXCEPT TROUBLE YOU CAN GET THAT FOR NOTHING
THE TROUBLE OF THE WORLD
MARIUS SLOWLY ASCENDED THE BOULEVARD TOWARDS THE BARRIER IN ORDER TO
REACH THE RUE SAINT JACQUES
HE WAS WALKING ALONG WITH DROOPING HEAD
ALL AT ONCE HE FELT SOME ONE ELBOW HIM IN THE DUSK HE WHEELED ROUND
AND SAW TWO YOUNG GIRLS CLAD IN RAGS THE ONE TALL AND SLIM THE OTHER A
LITTLE SHORTER WHO WERE PASSING RAPIDLY ALL OUT OF BREATH IN TERROR
AND WITH THE APPEARANCE OF FLEEING THEY HAD BEEN COMING TO MEET HIM
HAD NOT SEEN HIM AND HAD JOSTLED HIM AS THEY PASSED
THROUGH THE
TWILIGHT MARIUS COULD DISTINGUISH THEIR LIVID FACES THEIR WILD HEADS
THEIR DISHEVELLED HAIR THEIR HIDEOUS BONNETS THEIR RAGGED PETTICOATS
AND THEIR BARE FEET
THEY WERE TALKING AS THEY RAN
THE TALLER SAID IN A
VERY LOW VOICE
THE BOBBIES HAVE COME
THEY CAME NEAR NABBING ME AT THE HALF CIRCLE
THE OTHER ANSWERED I SAW THEM
I BOLTED BOLTED BOLTED
THROUGH THIS REPULSIVE SLANG MARIUS UNDERSTOOD THAT GENDARMES OR THE
POLICE HAD COME NEAR APPREHENDING THESE TWO CHILDREN AND THAT THE
LATTER HAD ESCAPED
THEY PLUNGED AMONG THE TREES OF THE BOULEVARD BEHIND HIM AND THERE
CREATED FOR A FEW MINUTES IN THE GLOOM A SORT OF VAGUE WHITE SPOT
THEN DISAPPEARED
MARIUS HAD HALTED FOR A MOMENT
HE WAS ABOUT TO PURSUE HIS WAY WHEN HIS EYE LIGHTED ON A LITTLE GRAYISH
PACKAGE LYING ON THE GROUND AT HIS FEET
HE STOOPED AND PICKED IT UP
IT
WAS A SORT OF ENVELOPE WHICH APPEARED TO CONTAIN PAPERS
GOOD HE SAID TO HIMSELF THOSE UNHAPPY GIRLS DROPPED IT
HE RETRACED HIS STEPS HE CALLED HE DID NOT FIND THEM HE REFLECTED
THAT THEY MUST ALREADY BE FAR AWAY PUT THE PACKAGE IN HIS POCKET AND
WENT OFF TO DINE
ON THE WAY HE SAW IN AN ALLEY OF THE RUE MOUFFETARD A CHILD'S COFFIN
COVERED WITH A BLACK CLOTH RESTING ON THREE CHAIRS AND ILLUMINATED BY A
CANDLE
THE TWO GIRLS OF THE TWILIGHT RECURRED TO HIS MIND
POOR MOTHERS HE THOUGHT
THERE IS ONE THING SADDER THAN TO SEE ONE'S
CHILDREN DIE IT IS TO SEE THEM LEADING AN EVIL LIFE
THEN THOSE SHADOWS WHICH HAD VARIED HIS MELANCHOLY VANISHED FROM HIS
THOUGHTS AND HE FELL BACK ONCE MORE INTO HIS HABITUAL PREOCCUPATIONS
HE FELL TO THINKING ONCE MORE OF HIS SIX MONTHS OF LOVE AND HAPPINESS
IN THE OPEN AIR AND THE BROAD DAYLIGHT BENEATH THE BEAUTIFUL TREES OF
LUXEMBOURG
HOW GLOOMY MY LIFE HAS BECOME HE SAID TO HIMSELF
YOUNG GIRLS ARE
ALWAYS APPEARING TO ME ONLY FORMERLY THEY WERE ANGELS AND NOW THEY ARE
GHOULS
CHAPTER III QUADRIFRONS
THAT EVENING AS HE WAS UNDRESSING PREPARATORY TO GOING TO BED HIS HAND
CAME IN CONTACT IN THE POCKET OF HIS COAT WITH THE PACKET WHICH HE
HAD PICKED UP ON THE BOULEVARD
HE HAD FORGOTTEN IT
HE THOUGHT THAT IT
WOULD BE WELL TO OPEN IT AND THAT THIS PACKAGE MIGHT POSSIBLY CONTAIN
THE ADDRESS OF THE YOUNG GIRLS IF IT REALLY BELONGED TO THEM AND IN
ANY CASE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO A RESTITUTION TO THE PERSON WHO
HAD LOST IT
HE OPENED THE ENVELOPE
IT WAS NOT SEALED AND CONTAINED FOUR LETTERS ALSO UNSEALED
THEY BORE ADDRESSES
ALL FOUR EXHALED A HORRIBLE ODOR OF TOBACCO
THE FIRST WAS ADDRESSED TO MADAME MADAME LA MARQUISE DE GRUCHERAY
THE PLACE OPPOSITE THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES NO
MARIUS SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD PROBABLY FIND IN IT THE
INFORMATION WHICH HE SOUGHT AND THAT MOREOVER THE LETTER BEING OPEN
IT WAS PROBABLE THAT IT COULD BE READ WITHOUT IMPROPRIETY
IT WAS CONCEIVED AS FOLLOWS
MADAME LA MARQUISE THE VIRTUE OF CLEMENCY AND PIETY IS THAT WHICH MOST
CLOSELY UNITES SOSIETY
TURN YOUR CHRISTIAN SPIRIT AND CAST A LOOK OF
COMPASSION ON THIS UNFORTUNATE SPANISH VICTIM OF LOYALTY AND ATTACHMENT
TO THE SACRED CAUSE OF LEGITIMACY WHO HAS GIVEN WITH HIS BLOOD
CONSECRATED HIS FORTUNE EVVERYTHING TO DEFEND THAT CAUSE AND TO DAY
FINDS HIMSELF IN THE GREATEST MISSERY
HE DOUBTS NOT THAT YOUR HONORABLE
PERSON WILL GRANT SUCCOR TO PRESERVE AN EXISTENCE EXTEREMELY PAINFUL FOR
A MILITARY MAN OF EDUCATION AND HONOR FULL OF WOUNDS COUNTS IN ADVANCE
ON THE HUMANITY WHICH ANIMATES YOU AND ON THE INTEREST WHICH MADAME LA
MARQUISE BEARS TO A NATION SO UNFORTUNATE
THEIR PRAYER WILL NOT BE IN
VAIN AND THEIR GRATITUDE WILL PRESERVE THEIRS CHARMING SOUVENIR
MY RESPECTFUL SENTIMENTS WITH WHICH I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE
MADAME
DON ALVARES SPANISH CAPTAIN
OF CAVALRY A ROYALIST WHO
HAS TAKE REFUGE IN FRANCE
WHO FINDS HIMSELF ON TRAVELLS
FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE
RESOURCES ARE LACKING HIM TO
CONTINUE HIS TRAVELLS
NO ADDRESS WAS JOINED TO THE SIGNATURE
MARIUS HOPED TO FIND THE ADDRESS
IN THE SECOND LETTER WHOSE SUPERSCRIPTION READ A MADAME MADAME LA
COMTESSE DE MONTVERNET RUE CASSETTE NO
9
THIS IS WHAT MARIUS READ IN
IT
MADAME LA COMTESSE IT IS AN UNHAPPY MOTHER OF A FAMILY OF SIX
CHILDREN THE LAST OF WHICH IS ONLY EIGHT MONTHS OLD
I SICK
SINCE MY LAST CONFINEMENT ABANDONED BY MY HUSBAND FIVE MONTHS AGO
HAVEING NO RESOURCES IN THE WORLD THE MOST FRIGHTFUL INDIGANCE
IN THE HOPE OF MADAME LA COMTESSE SHE HAS THE HONOR TO BE
MADAME WITH PROFOUND RESPECT
MISTRESS BALIZARD
MARIUS TURNED TO THE THIRD LETTER WHICH WAS A PETITION LIKE THE
PRECEDING HE READ
MONSIEUR PABOURGEOT ELECTOR WHOLESALE STOCKING MERCHANT
RUE SAINT DENIS ON THE CORNER OF THE RUE AUX FERS
I PERMIT MYSELF TO ADDRESS YOU THIS LETTER TO BEG YOU TO GRANT ME
THE PRETIOUS FAVOR OF YOUR SIMPATIES AND TO INTEREST YOURSELF IN A MAN
OF LETTERS WHO HAS JUST SENT A DRAMA TO THE THEATRE FRANCAIS
THE SUBJECT
IS HISTORICAL AND THE ACTION TAKES PLACE IN AUVERGNE IN THE TIME
OF THE EMPIRE THE STYLE I THINK IS NATURAL LACONIC AND MAY HAVE
SOME MERIT
THERE ARE COUPLETS TO BE SUNG IN FOUR PLACES
THE COMIC
THE SERIOUS THE UNEXPECTED ARE MINGLED IN A VARIETY OF CHARACTERS
AND A TINGE OF ROMANTICISM LIGHTLY SPREAD THROUGH ALL THE INTRIGUE
WHICH PROCEEDS MISTERIOUSLY AND ENDS AFTER STRIKING ALTARATIONS
IN THE MIDST OF MANY BEAUTIFUL STROKES OF BRILLIANT SCENES
MY PRINCIPAL OBJECT IS TO SATISFI THE DESIRE WHICH PROGRESSIVELY
ANIMATES THE MAN OF OUR CENTURY THAT IS TO SAY THE FASHION
THAT CAPRITIOUS AND BIZARRE WEATHERVANE WHICH CHANGES AT ALMOST
EVERY NEW WIND
IN SPITE OF THESE QUALITIES I HAVE REASON TO FEAR THAT JEALOUSY
THE EGOTISM OF PRIVILIGED AUTHORS MAY OBTAINE MY EXCLUSION FROM
THE THEATRE FOR I AM NOT IGNORANT OF THE MORTIFICATIONS WITH WHICH
NEW COMERS ARE TREATED
MONSIUER PABOURGEOT YOUR JUST REPUTATION AS AN ENLIGHTENED PROTECTOR
OF MEN OF LITTERS EMBOLDENS ME TO SEND YOU MY DAUGHTER WHO WILL
EXPLAIN OUR INDIGANT SITUATION TO YOU LACKING BREAD AND FIRE
IN THIS WYNTER SEASON
WHEN I SAY TO YOU THAT I BEG YOU TO ACCEPT
THE DEDICATION OF MY DRAMA WHICH I DESIRE TO MAKE TO YOU AND OF ALL
THOSE THAT I SHALL MAKE IS TO PROVE TO YOU HOW GREAT IS MY AMBITION
TO HAVE THE HONOR OF SHELTERING MYSELF UNDER YOUR PROTECTION
AND OF ADORNING MY WRITINGS WITH YOUR NAME
IF YOU DEIGN TO HONOR
ME WITH THE MOST MODEST OFFERING I SHALL IMMEDIATELY OCCUPY MYSELF
IN MAKING A PIESSE OF VERSE TO PAY YOU MY TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE
WHICH I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO RENDER THIS PIESSE AS PERFECT AS POSSIBLE
WILL BE SENT TO YOU BEFORE IT IS INSERTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
DRAMA AND DELIVERED ON THE STAGE
TO MONSIEUR
AND MADAME PABOURGEOT
MY MOST RESPECTFUL COMPLEMENTS
GENFLOT MAN OF LETTERS
P
S
EVEN IF IT IS ONLY FORTY SOUS
EXCUSE ME FOR SENDING MY DAUGHTER AND NOT PRESENTING MYSELF
BUT SAD MOTIVES CONNECTED WITH THE TOILET DO NOT PERMIT ME
ALAS TO GO OUT
FINALLY MARIUS OPENED THE FOURTH LETTER
THE ADDRESS RAN TO THE
BENEVOLENT GENTLEMAN OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT JACQUESDU HAUT PAS
IT
CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING LINES
BENEVOLENT MAN IF YOU DEIGN TO ACCOMPANY MY DAUGHTER YOU WILL
BEHOLD A MISSERABLE CALAMITY AND I WILL SHOW YOU MY CERTIFICATES
AT THE ASPECT OF THESE WRITINGS YOUR GENEROUS SOUL WILL BE MOVED
WITH A SENTIMENT OF OBVIOUS BENEVOLENCE FOR TRUE PHILOSOPHERS
ALWAYS FEEL LIVELY EMOTIONS
ADMIT COMPASSIONATE MAN THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUFFER THE MOST
CRUEL NEED AND THAT IT IS VERY PAINFUL FOR THE SAKE OF OBTAINING
A LITTLE RELIEF TO GET ONESELF ATTESTED BY THE AUTHORITIES AS THOUGH
ONE WERE NOT FREE TO SUFFER AND TO DIE OF INANITION WHILE WAITING
TO HAVE OUR MISERY RELIEVED
DESTINIES ARE VERY FATAL FOR SEVERAL
AND TOO PRODIGAL OR TOO PROTECTING FOR OTHERS
I AWAIT YOUR PRESENCE OR YOUR OFFERING IF YOU DEIGN TO MAKE ONE
AND I BESEECH YOU TO ACCEPT THE RESPECTFUL SENTIMENTS WITH WHICH I
HAVE THE HONOR TO BE
TRULY MAGNANIMOUS MAN
YOUR VERY HUMBLE
AND VERY OBEDIENT SERVANT
P
FABANTOU DRAMATIC ARTIST
AFTER PERUSING THESE FOUR LETTERS MARIUS DID NOT FIND HIMSELF MUCH
FURTHER ADVANCED THAN BEFORE
IN THE FIRST PLACE NOT ONE OF THE SIGNERS GAVE HIS ADDRESS
THEN THEY SEEMED TO COME FROM FOUR DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS DON ALVERAS
MISTRESS BALIZARD THE POET GENFLOT AND DRAMATIC ARTIST FABANTOU BUT
THE SINGULAR THING ABOUT THESE LETTERS WAS THAT ALL FOUR WERE WRITTEN
BY THE SAME HAND
WHAT CONCLUSION WAS TO BE DRAWN FROM THIS EXCEPT THAT THEY ALL COME
FROM THE SAME PERSON
MOREOVER AND THIS RENDERED THE CONJECTURE ALL THE MORE PROBABLE THE
COARSE AND YELLOW PAPER WAS THE SAME IN ALL FOUR THE ODOR OF TOBACCO
WAS THE SAME AND ALTHOUGH AN ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE TO VARY THE
STYLE THE SAME ORTHOGRAPHICAL FAULTS WERE REPRODUCED WITH THE GREATEST
TRANQUILLITY AND THE MAN OF LETTERS GENFLOT WAS NO MORE EXEMPT FROM
THEM THAN THE SPANISH CAPTAIN
IT WAS WASTE OF TROUBLE TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS PETTY MYSTERY
HAD IT NOT
BEEN A CHANCE FIND IT WOULD HAVE BORNE THE AIR OF A MYSTIFICATION
MARIUS WAS TOO MELANCHOLY TO TAKE EVEN A CHANCE PLEASANTRY WELL AND TO
LEND HIMSELF TO A GAME WHICH THE PAVEMENT OF THE STREET SEEMED DESIROUS
OF PLAYING WITH HIM
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS PLAYING THE PART OF
THE BLIND MAN IN BLIND MAN'S BUFF BETWEEN THE FOUR LETTERS AND THAT
THEY WERE MAKING SPORT OF HIM
NOTHING HOWEVER INDICATED THAT THESE LETTERS BELONGED TO THE TWO
YOUNG GIRLS WHOM MARIUS HAD MET ON THE BOULEVARD
AFTER ALL THEY WERE
EVIDENTLY PAPERS OF NO VALUE
MARIUS REPLACED THEM IN THEIR ENVELOPE
FLUNG THE WHOLE INTO A CORNER AND WENT TO BED
ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN
THE MORNING HE HAD JUST RISEN AND BREAKFASTED AND WAS TRYING TO SETTLE
DOWN TO WORK WHEN THERE CAME A SOFT KNOCK AT HIS DOOR
AS HE OWNED NOTHING HE NEVER LOCKED HIS DOOR UNLESS OCCASIONALLY
THOUGH VERY RARELY WHEN HE WAS ENGAGED IN SOME PRESSING WORK
EVEN WHEN
ABSENT HE LEFT HIS KEY IN THE LOCK
YOU WILL BE ROBBED SAID MA'AM
BOUGON
OF WHAT SAID MARIUS
THE TRUTH IS HOWEVER THAT HE HAD ONE
DAY BEEN ROBBED OF AN OLD PAIR OF BOOTS TO THE GREAT TRIUMPH OF MA'AM
BOUGON
THERE CAME A SECOND KNOCK AS GENTLE AS THE FIRST
COME IN SAID MARIUS
THE DOOR OPENED
WHAT DO YOU WANT MA'AM BOUGON ASKED MARIUS WITHOUT RAISING HIS EYES
FROM THE BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS ON HIS TABLE
A VOICE WHICH DID NOT BELONG TO MA'AM BOUGON REPLIED
EXCUSE ME SIR
IT WAS A DULL BROKEN HOARSE STRANGLED VOICE THE VOICE OF AN OLD MAN
ROUGHENED WITH BRANDY AND LIQUOR
MARIUS TURNED ROUND HASTILY AND BEHELD A YOUNG GIRL
CHAPTER IV A ROSE IN MISERY
ILLUSTRATION ROSE IN MISERY 3B8 4 ROSE IN MISERY
A VERY YOUNG GIRL WAS STANDING IN THE HALF OPEN DOOR
THE DORMER WINDOW
OF THE GARRET THROUGH WHICH THE LIGHT FELL WAS PRECISELY OPPOSITE
THE DOOR AND ILLUMINATED THE FIGURE WITH A WAN LIGHT
SHE WAS A FRAIL
EMACIATED SLENDER CREATURE THERE WAS NOTHING BUT A CHEMISE AND A
PETTICOAT UPON THAT CHILLED AND SHIVERING NAKEDNESS
HER GIRDLE WAS A
STRING HER HEAD RIBBON A STRING HER POINTED SHOULDERS EMERGED FROM HER
CHEMISE A BLOND AND LYMPHATIC PALLOR EARTH COLORED COLLAR BONES RED
HANDS A HALF OPEN AND DEGRADED MOUTH MISSING TEETH DULL BOLD BASE
EYES SHE HAD THE FORM OF A YOUNG GIRL WHO HAS MISSED HER YOUTH AND THE
LOOK OF A CORRUPT OLD WOMAN FIFTY YEARS MINGLED WITH FIFTEEN ONE OF
THOSE BEINGS WHICH ARE BOTH FEEBLE AND HORRIBLE AND WHICH CAUSE THOSE
TO SHUDDER WHOM THEY DO NOT CAUSE TO WEEP
MARIUS HAD RISEN AND WAS STARING IN A SORT OF STUPOR AT THIS BEING WHO
WAS ALMOST LIKE THE FORMS OF THE SHADOWS WHICH TRAVERSE DREAMS
THE MOST HEART BREAKING THING OF ALL WAS THAT THIS YOUNG GIRL HAD NOT
COME INTO THE WORLD TO BE HOMELY
IN HER EARLY CHILDHOOD SHE MUST EVEN
HAVE BEEN PRETTY
THE GRACE OF HER AGE WAS STILL STRUGGLING AGAINST THE
HIDEOUS PREMATURE DECREPITUDE OF DEBAUCHERY AND POVERTY
THE REMAINS OF
BEAUTY WERE DYING AWAY IN THAT FACE OF SIXTEEN LIKE THE PALE SUNLIGHT
WHICH IS EXTINGUISHED UNDER HIDEOUS CLOUDS AT DAWN ON A WINTER'S DAY
THAT FACE WAS NOT WHOLLY UNKNOWN TO MARIUS
HE THOUGHT HE REMEMBERED
HAVING SEEN IT SOMEWHERE
WHAT DO YOU WISH MADEMOISELLE HE ASKED
THE YOUNG GIRL REPLIED IN HER VOICE OF A DRUNKEN CONVICT
HERE IS A LETTER FOR YOU MONSIEUR MARIUS
SHE CALLED MARIUS BY HIS NAME HE COULD NOT DOUBT THAT HE WAS THE PERSON
WHOM SHE WANTED BUT WHO WAS THIS GIRL HOW DID SHE KNOW HIS NAME
WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM TO TELL HER TO ADVANCE SHE ENTERED
SHE ENTERED
RESOLUTELY STARING WITH A SORT OF ASSURANCE THAT MADE THE HEART BLEED
AT THE WHOLE ROOM AND THE UNMADE BED
HER FEET WERE BARE
LARGE HOLES
IN HER PETTICOAT PERMITTED GLIMPSES OF HER LONG LEGS AND HER THIN KNEES
SHE WAS SHIVERING
SHE HELD A LETTER IN HER HAND WHICH SHE PRESENTED TO MARIUS
MARIUS AS HE OPENED THE LETTER NOTICED THAT THE ENORMOUS WAFER WHICH
SEALED IT WAS STILL MOIST
THE MESSAGE COULD NOT HAVE COME FROM A
DISTANCE
HE READ
MY AMIABLE NEIGHBOR YOUNG MAN I HAVE LEARNED OF YOUR GOODNESS TO ME
THAT YOU PAID MY RENT SIX MONTHS AGO
I BLESS YOU YOUNG MAN
MY ELDEST DAUGHTER WILL TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A MORSEL
OF BREAD FOR TWO DAYS FOUR PERSONS AND MY SPOUSE ILL
IF I AM
NOT DESEAVED IN MY OPINION I THINK I MAY HOPE THAT YOUR GENEROUS
HEART WILL MELT AT THIS STATEMENT AND THE DESIRE WILL SUBJUGATE YOU
TO BE PROPITIOUS TO ME BY DAIGNING TO LAVISH ON ME A SLIGHT FAVOR
I AM WITH THE DISTINGUISHED CONSIDERATION WHICH IS DUE TO THE
BENEFACTORS OF HUMANITY
JONDRETTE
P S
MY ELDEST DAUGHTER WILL AWAIT YOUR ORDERS DEAR MONSIEUR MARIUS
THIS LETTER COMING IN THE VERY MIDST OF THE MYSTERIOUS ADVENTURE WHICH
HAD OCCUPIED MARIUS' THOUGHTS EVER SINCE THE PRECEDING EVENING WAS LIKE
A CANDLE IN A CELLAR
ALL WAS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATED
THIS LETTER CAME FROM THE SAME PLACE AS THE OTHER FOUR
THERE WAS THE
SAME WRITING THE SAME STYLE THE SAME ORTHOGRAPHY THE SAME PAPER THE
SAME ODOR OF TOBACCO
THERE WERE FIVE MISSIVES FIVE HISTORIES FIVE SIGNATURES AND A SINGLE
SIGNER
THE SPANISH CAPTAIN DON ALVARES THE UNHAPPY MISTRESS BALIZARD
THE DRAMATIC POET GENFLOT THE OLD COMEDIAN FABANTOU WERE ALL FOUR
NAMED JONDRETTE IF INDEED JONDRETTE HIMSELF WERE NAMED JONDRETTE
MARIUS HAD LIVED IN THE HOUSE FOR A TOLERABLY LONG TIME AND HE HAD HAD
AS WE HAVE SAID BUT VERY RARE OCCASION TO SEE TO EVEN CATCH A GLIMPSE
OF HIS EXTREMELY MEAN NEIGHBORS
HIS MIND WAS ELSEWHERE AND WHERE THE
MIND IS THERE THE EYES ARE ALSO
HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED MORE THAN ONCE TO
PASS THE JONDRETTES IN THE CORRIDOR OR ON THE STAIRS BUT THEY WERE MERE
FORMS TO HIM HE HAD PAID SO LITTLE HEED TO THEM THAT ON THE PRECEDING
EVENING HE HAD JOSTLED THE JONDRETTE GIRLS ON THE BOULEVARD WITHOUT
RECOGNIZING THEM FOR IT HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN THEY AND IT WAS WITH GREAT
DIFFICULTY THAT THE ONE WHO HAD JUST ENTERED HIS ROOM HAD AWAKENED IN
HIM IN SPITE OF DISGUST AND PITY A VAGUE RECOLLECTION OF HAVING MET
HER ELSEWHERE
NOW HE SAW EVERYTHING CLEARLY
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS NEIGHBOR
JONDRETTE IN HIS DISTRESS EXERCISED THE INDUSTRY OF SPECULATING ON THE
CHARITY OF BENEVOLENT PERSONS THAT HE PROCURED ADDRESSES AND THAT HE
WROTE UNDER FEIGNED NAMES TO PEOPLE WHOM HE JUDGED TO BE WEALTHY AND
COMPASSIONATE LETTERS WHICH HIS DAUGHTERS DELIVERED AT THEIR RISK
AND PERIL FOR THIS FATHER HAD COME TO SUCH A PASS THAT HE RISKED HIS
DAUGHTERS HE WAS PLAYING A GAME WITH FATE AND HE USED THEM AS THE
STAKE
MARIUS UNDERSTOOD THAT PROBABLY JUDGING FROM THEIR FLIGHT ON THE
EVENING BEFORE FROM THEIR BREATHLESS CONDITION FROM THEIR TERROR
AND FROM THE WORDS OF SLANG WHICH HE HAD OVERHEARD THESE UNFORTUNATE
CREATURES WERE PLYING SOME INEXPLICABLY SAD PROFESSION AND THAT THE
RESULT OF THE WHOLE WAS IN THE MIDST OF HUMAN SOCIETY AS IT IS NOW
CONSTITUTED TWO MISERABLE BEINGS WHO WERE NEITHER GIRLS NOR WOMEN A
SPECIES OF IMPURE AND INNOCENT MONSTERS PRODUCED BY MISERY
SAD CREATURES WITHOUT NAME OR SEX OR AGE TO WHOM NEITHER GOOD NOR
EVIL WERE ANY LONGER POSSIBLE AND WHO ON EMERGING FROM CHILDHOOD
HAVE ALREADY NOTHING IN THIS WORLD NEITHER LIBERTY NOR VIRTUE NOR
RESPONSIBILITY
SOULS WHICH BLOSSOMED OUT YESTERDAY AND ARE FADED
TO DAY LIKE THOSE FLOWERS LET FALL IN THE STREETS WHICH ARE SOILED
WITH EVERY SORT OF MIRE WHILE WAITING FOR SOME WHEEL TO CRUSH THEM
NEVERTHELESS WHILE MARIUS BENT A PAINED AND ASTONISHED GAZE ON HER THE
YOUNG GIRL WAS WANDERING BACK AND FORTH IN THE GARRET WITH THE AUDACITY
OF A SPECTRE
SHE KICKED ABOUT WITHOUT TROUBLING HERSELF AS TO HER
NAKEDNESS
OCCASIONALLY HER CHEMISE WHICH WAS UNTIED AND TORN FELL
ALMOST TO HER WAIST
SHE MOVED THE CHAIRS ABOUT SHE DISARRANGED THE
TOILET ARTICLES WHICH STOOD ON THE COMMODE SHE HANDLED MARIUS' CLOTHES
SHE RUMMAGED ABOUT TO SEE WHAT THERE WAS IN THE CORNERS
HULLO SAID SHE YOU HAVE A MIRROR
AND SHE HUMMED SCRAPS OF VAUDEVILLES AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN ALONE
FROLICSOME REFRAINS WHICH HER HOARSE AND GUTTURAL VOICE RENDERED
LUGUBRIOUS
AN INDESCRIBABLE CONSTRAINT WEARINESS AND HUMILIATION WERE PERCEPTIBLE
BENEATH THIS HARDIHOOD
EFFRONTERY IS A DISGRACE
NOTHING COULD BE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN TO SEE HER SPORT ABOUT THE ROOM
AND SO TO SPEAK FLIT WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF A BIRD WHICH IS FRIGHTENED
BY THE DAYLIGHT OR WHICH HAS BROKEN ITS WING
ONE FELT THAT UNDER OTHER
CONDITIONS OF EDUCATION AND DESTINY THE GAY AND OVER FREE MIEN OF THIS
YOUNG GIRL MIGHT HAVE TURNED OUT SWEET AND CHARMING
NEVER EVEN AMONG
ANIMALS DOES THE CREATURE BORN TO BE A DOVE CHANGE INTO AN OSPREY
THAT
IS ONLY TO BE SEEN AMONG MEN
MARIUS REFLECTED AND ALLOWED HER TO HAVE HER WAY
SHE APPROACHED THE TABLE
AH SAID SHE BOOKS
A FLASH PIERCED HER GLASSY EYE
SHE RESUMED AND HER ACCENT EXPRESSED
THE HAPPINESS WHICH SHE FELT IN BOASTING OF SOMETHING TO WHICH NO HUMAN
CREATURE IS INSENSIBLE
I KNOW HOW TO READ I DO
SHE EAGERLY SEIZED A BOOK WHICH LAY OPEN ON THE TABLE AND READ WITH
TOLERABLE FLUENCY
GENERAL BAUDUIN RECEIVED ORDERS TO TAKE THE CHATEAU OF HOUGOMONT
WHICH STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAIN OF WATERLOO WITH FIVE
BATTALIONS OF HIS BRIGADE
SHE PAUSED
AH WATERLOO I KNOW ABOUT THAT
IT WAS A BATTLE LONG AGO
MY FATHER
WAS THERE
MY FATHER HAS SERVED IN THE ARMIES
WE ARE FINE BONAPARTISTS
IN OUR HOUSE THAT WE ARE WATERLOO WAS AGAINST THE ENGLISH
SHE LAID DOWN THE BOOK CAUGHT UP A PEN AND EXCLAIMED
AND I KNOW HOW TO WRITE TOO
SHE DIPPED HER PEN IN THE INK AND TURNING TO MARIUS
DO YOU WANT TO SEE LOOK HERE I'M GOING TO WRITE A WORD TO SHOW YOU
AND BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO ANSWER SHE WROTE ON A SHEET OF WHITE PAPER
WHICH LAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE THE BOBBIES ARE HERE
THEN THROWING DOWN THE PEN
THERE ARE NO FAULTS OF ORTHOGRAPHY
YOU CAN LOOK
WE HAVE RECEIVED AN
EDUCATION MY SISTER AND I
WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN AS WE ARE NOW
WE
WERE NOT MADE
HERE SHE PAUSED FIXED HER DULL EYES ON MARIUS AND BURST OUT LAUGHING
SAYING WITH AN INTONATION WHICH CONTAINED EVERY FORM OF ANGUISH
STIFLED BY EVERY FORM OF CYNICISM
BAH
AND SHE BEGAN TO HUM THESE WORDS TO A GAY AIR
J'AI FAIM MON PERE I AM HUNGRY FATHER
PAS DE FRICOT
I HAVE NO FOOD
J'AI FROID MA MERE
I AM COLD MOTHER
PAS DE TRICOT
I HAVE NO CLOTHES
GRELOTTE LOLOTTE
LOLOTTE SHIVER
SANGLOTE SOB
JACQUOT JACQUOT
SHE HAD HARDLY FINISHED THIS COUPLET WHEN SHE EXCLAIMED
DO YOU EVER GO TO THE PLAY MONSIEUR MARIUS I DO
I HAVE A LITTLE
BROTHER WHO IS A FRIEND OF THE ARTISTS AND WHO GIVES ME TICKETS
SOMETIMES
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE BENCHES IN THE GALLERIES
ONE IS CRAMPED
AND UNCOMFORTABLE THERE
THERE ARE ROUGH PEOPLE THERE SOMETIMES AND
PEOPLE WHO SMELL BAD
THEN SHE SCRUTINIZED MARIUS ASSUMED A SINGULAR AIR AND SAID
DO YOU KNOW MR
MARIUS THAT YOU ARE A VERY HANDSOME FELLOW
AND AT THE SAME MOMENT THE SAME IDEA OCCURRED TO THEM BOTH AND MADE
HER SMILE AND HIM BLUSH
SHE STEPPED UP TO HIM AND LAID HER HAND ON HIS
SHOULDER YOU PAY NO HEED TO ME BUT I KNOW YOU MR
MARIUS
I MEET YOU
HERE ON THE STAIRCASE AND THEN I OFTEN SEE YOU GOING TO A PERSON NAMED
FATHER MABEUF WHO LIVES IN THE DIRECTION OF AUSTERLITZ SOMETIMES WHEN I
HAVE BEEN STROLLING IN THAT QUARTER
IT IS VERY BECOMING TO YOU TO HAVE
YOUR HAIR TUMBLED THUS
SHE TRIED TO RENDER HER VOICE SOFT BUT ONLY SUCCEEDED IN MAKING IT VERY
DEEP
A PORTION OF HER WORDS WAS LOST IN THE TRANSIT FROM HER LARYNX TO
HER LIPS AS THOUGH ON A PIANO WHERE SOME NOTES ARE MISSING
MARIUS HAD RETREATED GENTLY
MADEMOISELLE SAID HE WITH HIS COOL GRAVITY I HAVE HERE A PACKAGE
WHICH BELONGS TO YOU I THINK
PERMIT ME TO RETURN IT TO YOU
AND HE HELD OUT THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE FOUR LETTERS
SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS AND EXCLAIMED
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR THAT
THEN SHE EAGERLY SEIZED THE PACKAGE AND OPENED THE ENVELOPE SAYING AS
SHE DID SO
DIEU DE DIEU HOW MY SISTER AND I HAVE HUNTED AND IT WAS YOU WHO FOUND
IT ON THE BOULEVARD WAS IT NOT IT MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE BOULEVARD
YOU SEE WE LET IT FALL WHEN WE WERE RUNNING
IT WAS THAT BRAT OF A
SISTER OF MINE WHO WAS SO STUPID
WHEN WE GOT HOME WE COULD NOT FIND IT
ANYWHERE
AS WE DID NOT WISH TO BE BEATEN AS THAT IS USELESS AS THAT
IS ENTIRELY USELESS AS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS WE SAID THAT WE HAD
CARRIED THE LETTERS TO THE PROPER PERSONS AND THAT THEY HAD SAID TO US
'NIX SO HERE THEY ARE THOSE POOR LETTERS AND HOW DID YOU FIND OUT
THAT THEY BELONGED TO ME AH YES THE WRITING
SO IT WAS YOU THAT WE
JOSTLED AS WE PASSED LAST NIGHT
WE COULDN'T SEE
I SAID TO MY SISTER
'IS IT A GENTLEMAN MY SISTER SAID TO ME 'I THINK IT IS A GENTLEMAN
IN THE MEANWHILE SHE HAD UNFOLDED THE PETITION ADDRESSED TO THE
BENEVOLENT GENTLEMAN OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT JACQUESDU HAUT PAS
HERE SAID SHE THIS IS FOR THAT OLD FELLOW WHO GOES TO MASS
BY THE
WAY THIS IS HIS HOUR
I'LL GO AND CARRY IT TO HIM
PERHAPS HE WILL GIVE
US SOMETHING TO BREAKFAST ON
THEN SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH AGAIN AND ADDED
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT WILL MEAN IF WE GET A BREAKFAST TODAY IT WILL MEAN
THAT WE SHALL HAVE HAD OUR BREAKFAST OF THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY OUR
BREAKFAST OF YESTERDAY OUR DINNER OF TO DAY AND ALL THAT AT ONCE AND
THIS MORNING
COME PARBLEU IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED DOGS BURST
THIS REMINDED MARIUS OF THE WRETCHED GIRL'S ERRAND TO HIMSELF
HE
FUMBLED IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET AND FOUND NOTHING THERE
THE YOUNG GIRL WENT ON AND SEEMED TO HAVE NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF MARIUS'
PRESENCE
I OFTEN GO OFF IN THE EVENING
SOMETIMES I DON'T COME HOME AGAIN
LAST
WINTER BEFORE WE CAME HERE WE LIVED UNDER THE ARCHES OF THE BRIDGES
WE HUDDLED TOGETHER TO KEEP FROM FREEZING
MY LITTLE SISTER CRIED
HOW
MELANCHOLY THE WATER IS WHEN I THOUGHT OF DROWNING MYSELF I SAID
TO MYSELF 'NO IT'S TOO COLD I GO OUT ALONE WHENEVER I CHOOSE I
SOMETIMES SLEEP IN THE DITCHES
DO YOU KNOW AT NIGHT WHEN I WALK ALONG
THE BOULEVARD I SEE THE TREES LIKE FORKS I SEE HOUSES ALL BLACK AND
AS BIG AS NOTRE DAME I FANCY THAT THE WHITE WALLS ARE THE RIVER I SAY
TO MYSELF 'WHY THERE'S WATER THERE THE STARS ARE LIKE THE LAMPS IN
ILLUMINATIONS ONE WOULD SAY THAT THEY SMOKED AND THAT THE WIND BLEW
THEM OUT I AM BEWILDERED AS THOUGH HORSES WERE BREATHING IN MY EARS
ALTHOUGH IT IS NIGHT I HEAR HAND ORGANS AND SPINNING MACHINES AND I
DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL
I THINK PEOPLE ARE FLINGING STONES AT ME I FLEE
WITHOUT KNOWING WHITHER EVERYTHING WHIRLS AND WHIRLS
YOU FEEL VERY
QUEER WHEN YOU HAVE HAD NO FOOD
AND THEN SHE STARED AT HIM WITH A BEWILDERED AIR
BY DINT OF SEARCHING AND RANSACKING HIS POCKETS MARIUS HAD FINALLY
COLLECTED FIVE FRANCS SIXTEEN SOUS
THIS WAS ALL HE OWNED IN THE WORLD
FOR THE MOMENT
AT ALL EVENTS HE THOUGHT THERE IS MY DINNER FOR
TO DAY AND TO MORROW WE WILL SEE HE KEPT THE SIXTEEN SOUS AND HANDED
THE FIVE FRANCS TO THE YOUNG GIRL
SHE SEIZED THE COIN
GOOD SAID SHE THE SUN IS SHINING
AND AS THOUGH THE SUN HAD POSSESSED THE PROPERTY OF MELTING THE
AVALANCHES OF SLANG IN HER BRAIN SHE WENT ON
FIVE FRANCS THE SHINER A MONARCH IN THIS HOLE AIN'T THIS FINE
YOU'RE A JOLLY THIEF I'M YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT BRAVO FOR THE GOOD
FELLOWS TWO DAYS' WINE AND MEAT AND STEW WE'LL HAVE A ROYAL FEAST
AND A GOOD FILL
SHE PULLED HER CHEMISE UP ON HER SHOULDERS MADE A LOW BOW TO MARIUS
THEN A FAMILIAR SIGN WITH HER HAND AND WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR SAYING
GOOD MORNING SIR
IT'S ALL RIGHT
I'LL GO AND FIND MY OLD MAN
AS SHE PASSED SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A DRY CRUST OF BREAD ON THE COMMODE
WHICH WAS MOULDING THERE AMID THE DUST SHE FLUNG HERSELF UPON IT AND
BIT INTO IT MUTTERING
THAT'S GOOD IT'S HARD IT BREAKS MY TEETH
THEN SHE DEPARTED
CHAPTER V A PROVIDENTIAL PEEP HOLE
MARIUS HAD LIVED FOR FIVE YEARS IN POVERTY IN DESTITUTION EVEN IN
DISTRESS BUT HE NOW PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD NOT KNOWN REAL MISERY
TRUE
MISERY HE HAD BUT JUST HAD A VIEW OF
IT WAS ITS SPECTRE WHICH HAD JUST
PASSED BEFORE HIS EYES
IN FACT HE WHO HAS ONLY BEHELD THE MISERY OF
MAN HAS SEEN NOTHING THE MISERY OF WOMAN IS WHAT HE MUST SEE HE WHO
HAS SEEN ONLY THE MISERY OF WOMAN HAS SEEN NOTHING HE MUST SEE THE
MISERY OF THE CHILD
WHEN A MAN HAS REACHED HIS LAST EXTREMITY HE HAS REACHED HIS LAST
RESOURCES AT THE SAME TIME
WOE TO THE DEFENCELESS BEINGS WHO SURROUND
HIM WORK WAGES BREAD FIRE COURAGE GOOD WILL ALL FAIL HIM
SIMULTANEOUSLY
THE LIGHT OF DAY SEEMS EXTINGUISHED WITHOUT THE MORAL
LIGHT WITHIN IN THESE SHADOWS MAN ENCOUNTERS THE FEEBLENESS OF THE
WOMAN AND THE CHILD AND BENDS THEM VIOLENTLY TO IGNOMINY
THEN ALL HORRORS BECOME POSSIBLE
DESPAIR IS SURROUNDED WITH FRAGILE
PARTITIONS WHICH ALL OPEN ON EITHER VICE OR CRIME
HEALTH YOUTH HONOR ALL THE SHY DELICACIES OF THE YOUNG BODY THE
HEART VIRGINITY MODESTY THAT EPIDERMIS OF THE SOUL ARE MANIPULATED
IN SINISTER WISE BY THAT FUMBLING WHICH SEEKS RESOURCES WHICH
ENCOUNTERS OPPROBRIUM AND WHICH ACCOMMODATES ITSELF TO IT
FATHERS
MOTHERS CHILDREN BROTHERS SISTERS MEN WOMEN DAUGHTERS ADHERE
AND BECOME INCORPORATED ALMOST LIKE A MINERAL FORMATION IN THAT DUSKY
PROMISCUOUSNESS OF SEXES RELATIONSHIPS AGES INFAMIES AND INNOCENCES
THEY CROUCH BACK TO BACK IN A SORT OF HUT OF FATE
THEY EXCHANGE
WOE BEGONE GLANCES
OH THE UNFORTUNATE WRETCHES HOW PALE THEY ARE HOW
COLD THEY ARE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THEY DWELT IN A PLANET MUCH FURTHER
FROM THE SUN THAN OURS
THIS YOUNG GIRL WAS TO MARIUS A SORT OF MESSENGER FROM THE REALM OF SAD
SHADOWS
SHE REVEALED TO HIM A HIDEOUS SIDE OF THE NIGHT
MARIUS ALMOST REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR THE PREOCCUPATIONS OF REVERY AND
PASSION WHICH HAD PREVENTED HIS BESTOWING A GLANCE ON HIS NEIGHBORS UP
TO THAT DAY
THE PAYMENT OF THEIR RENT HAD BEEN A MECHANICAL MOVEMENT
WHICH ANY ONE WOULD HAVE YIELDED TO BUT HE MARIUS SHOULD HAVE DONE
BETTER THAN THAT
WHAT ONLY A WALL SEPARATED HIM FROM THOSE ABANDONED
BEINGS WHO LIVED GROPINGLY IN THE DARK OUTSIDE THE PALE OF THE REST OF
THE WORLD HE WAS ELBOW TO ELBOW WITH THEM HE WAS IN SOME SORT THE
LAST LINK OF THE HUMAN RACE WHICH THEY TOUCHED HE HEARD THEM LIVE OR
RATHER RATTLE IN THE DEATH AGONY BESIDE HIM AND HE PAID NO HEED TO
THEM EVERY DAY EVERY INSTANT HE HEARD THEM WALKING ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE WALL HE HEARD THEM GO AND COME AND SPEAK AND HE DID NOT EVEN
LEND AN EAR AND GROANS LAY IN THOSE WORDS AND HE DID NOT EVEN LISTEN
TO THEM HIS THOUGHTS WERE ELSEWHERE GIVEN UP TO DREAMS TO IMPOSSIBLE
RADIANCES TO LOVES IN THE AIR TO FOLLIES AND ALL THE WHILE HUMAN
CREATURES HIS BROTHERS IN JESUS CHRIST HIS BROTHERS IN THE PEOPLE
WERE AGONIZING IN VAIN BESIDE HIM HE EVEN FORMED A PART OF THEIR
MISFORTUNE AND HE AGGRAVATED IT
FOR IF THEY HAD HAD ANOTHER NEIGHBOR
WHO WAS LESS CHIMERICAL AND MORE ATTENTIVE ANY ORDINARY AND CHARITABLE
MAN EVIDENTLY THEIR INDIGENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTICED THEIR SIGNALS OF
DISTRESS WOULD HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN HOLD
OF AND RESCUED THEY APPEARED VERY CORRUPT AND VERY DEPRAVED NO
DOUBT VERY VILE VERY ODIOUS EVEN BUT THOSE WHO FALL WITHOUT BECOMING
DEGRADED ARE RARE BESIDES THERE IS A POINT WHERE THE UNFORTUNATE AND
THE INFAMOUS UNITE AND ARE CONFOUNDED IN A SINGLE WORD A FATAL WORD
THE MISERABLE WHOSE FAULT IS THIS AND THEN SHOULD NOT THE CHARITY BE
ALL THE MORE PROFOUND IN PROPORTION AS THE FALL IS GREAT
WHILE READING HIMSELF THIS MORAL LESSON FOR THERE WERE OCCASIONS ON
WHICH MARIUS LIKE ALL TRULY HONEST HEARTS WAS HIS OWN PEDAGOGUE AND
SCOLDED HIMSELF MORE THAN HE DESERVED HE STARED AT THE WALL WHICH
SEPARATED HIM FROM THE JONDRETTES AS THOUGH HE WERE ABLE TO MAKE HIS
GAZE FULL OF PITY PENETRATE THAT PARTITION AND WARM THESE WRETCHED
PEOPLE
THE WALL WAS A THIN LAYER OF PLASTER UPHELD BY LATHES AND BEAMS
AND AS THE READER HAD JUST LEARNED IT ALLOWED THE SOUND OF VOICES AND
WORDS TO BE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED
ONLY A MAN AS DREAMY AS MARIUS COULD
HAVE FAILED TO PERCEIVE THIS LONG BEFORE
THERE WAS NO PAPER PASTED ON
THE WALL EITHER ON THE SIDE OF THE JONDRETTES OR ON THAT OF MARIUS THE
COARSE CONSTRUCTION WAS VISIBLE IN ITS NAKEDNESS
MARIUS EXAMINED THE
PARTITION ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY SOMETIMES REVERY EXAMINES OBSERVES
AND SCRUTINIZES AS THOUGHT WOULD
ALL AT ONCE HE SPRANG UP HE HAD JUST
PERCEIVED NEAR THE TOP CLOSE TO THE CEILING A TRIANGULAR HOLE WHICH
RESULTED FROM THE SPACE BETWEEN THREE LATHES
THE PLASTER WHICH SHOULD
HAVE FILLED THIS CAVITY WAS MISSING AND BY MOUNTING ON THE COMMODE
A VIEW COULD BE HAD THROUGH THIS APERTURE INTO THE JONDRETTES' ATTIC
COMMISERATION HAS AND SHOULD HAVE ITS CURIOSITY
THIS APERTURE FORMED
A SORT OF PEEP HOLE
IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO GAZE AT MISFORTUNE LIKE A
TRAITOR IN ORDER TO SUCCOR IT 27
LET US GET SOME LITTLE IDEA OF WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE LIKE THOUGHT
MARIUS AND IN WHAT CONDITION THEY ARE
HE CLIMBED UPON THE COMMODE PUT HIS EYE TO THE CREVICE AND LOOKED
CHAPTER VI THE WILD MAN IN HIS LAIR
CITIES LIKE FORESTS HAVE THEIR CAVERNS IN WHICH ALL THE MOST WICKED
AND FORMIDABLE CREATURES WHICH THEY CONTAIN CONCEAL THEMSELVES
ONLY
IN CITIES THAT WHICH THUS CONCEALS ITSELF IS FEROCIOUS UNCLEAN AND
PETTY THAT IS TO SAY UGLY IN FORESTS THAT WHICH CONCEALS ITSELF IS
FEROCIOUS SAVAGE AND GRAND THAT IS TO SAY BEAUTIFUL
TAKING ONE LAIR
WITH ANOTHER THE BEAST'S IS PREFERABLE TO THE MAN'S
CAVERNS ARE BETTER
THAN HOVELS
WHAT MARIUS NOW BEHELD WAS A HOVEL
MARIUS WAS POOR AND HIS CHAMBER WAS POVERTY STRICKEN BUT AS HIS
POVERTY WAS NOBLE HIS GARRET WAS NEAT
THE DEN UPON WHICH HIS EYE NOW
RESTED WAS ABJECT DIRTY FETID PESTIFEROUS MEAN SORDID
THE ONLY
FURNITURE CONSISTED OF A STRAW CHAIR AN INFIRM TABLE SOME OLD BITS OF
CROCKERY AND IN TWO OF THE CORNERS TWO INDESCRIBABLE PALLETS ALL
THE LIGHT WAS FURNISHED BY A DORMER WINDOW OF FOUR PANES DRAPED WITH
SPIDERS' WEBS
THROUGH THIS APERTURE THERE PENETRATED JUST ENOUGH LIGHT
TO MAKE THE FACE OF A MAN APPEAR LIKE THE FACE OF A PHANTOM
THE WALLS
HAD A LEPROUS ASPECT AND WERE COVERED WITH SEAMS AND SCARS LIKE A
VISAGE DISFIGURED BY SOME HORRIBLE MALADY A REPULSIVE MOISTURE EXUDED
FROM THEM
OBSCENE SKETCHES ROUGHLY SKETCHED WITH CHARCOAL COULD BE
DISTINGUISHED UPON THEM
THE CHAMBER WHICH MARIUS OCCUPIED HAD A DILAPIDATED BRICK PAVEMENT THIS
ONE WAS NEITHER TILED NOR PLANKED ITS INHABITANTS STEPPED DIRECTLY
ON THE ANTIQUE PLASTER OF THE HOVEL WHICH HAD GROWN BLACK UNDER THE
LONG CONTINUED PRESSURE OF FEET
UPON THIS UNEVEN FLOOR WHERE THE DIRT
SEEMED TO BE FAIRLY INCRUSTED AND WHICH POSSESSED BUT ONE VIRGINITY
THAT OF THE BROOM WERE CAPRICIOUSLY GROUPED CONSTELLATIONS OF OLD
SHOES SOCKS AND REPULSIVE RAGS HOWEVER THIS ROOM HAD A FIREPLACE
SO IT WAS LET FOR FORTY FRANCS A YEAR
THERE WAS EVERY SORT OF THING
IN THAT FIREPLACE A BRAZIER A POT BROKEN BOARDS RAGS SUSPENDED
FROM NAILS A BIRD CAGE ASHES AND EVEN A LITTLE FIRE
TWO BRANDS WERE
SMOULDERING THERE IN A MELANCHOLY WAY
ONE THING WHICH ADDED STILL MORE TO THE HORRORS OF THIS GARRET WAS THAT
IT WAS LARGE
IT HAD PROJECTIONS AND ANGLES AND BLACK HOLES THE LOWER
SIDES OF ROOFS BAYS AND PROMONTORIES
HENCE HORRIBLE UNFATHOMABLE
NOOKS WHERE IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SPIDERS AS BIG AS ONE'S FIST WOOD LICE
AS LARGE AS ONE'S FOOT AND PERHAPS EVEN WHO KNOWS SOME MONSTROUS
HUMAN BEINGS MUST BE HIDING
ONE OF THE PALLETS WAS NEAR THE DOOR THE OTHER NEAR THE WINDOW
ONE
END OF EACH TOUCHED THE FIREPLACE AND FACED MARIUS
IN A CORNER NEAR THE
APERTURE THROUGH WHICH MARIUS WAS GAZING A COLORED ENGRAVING IN A BLACK
FRAME WAS SUSPENDED TO A NAIL ON THE WALL AND AT ITS BOTTOM IN LARGE
LETTERS WAS THE INSCRIPTION THE DREAM
THIS REPRESENTED A SLEEPING
WOMAN AND A CHILD ALSO ASLEEP THE CHILD ON THE WOMAN'S LAP AN EAGLE
IN A CLOUD WITH A CROWN IN HIS BEAK AND THE WOMAN THRUSTING THE
CROWN AWAY FROM THE CHILD'S HEAD WITHOUT AWAKING THE LATTER IN THE
BACKGROUND NAPOLEON IN A GLORY LEANING ON A VERY BLUE COLUMN WITH A
YELLOW CAPITAL ORNAMENTED WITH THIS INSCRIPTION
MARINGO
AUSTERLITS
IENA
WAGRAMME
ELOT
BENEATH THIS FRAME A SORT OF WOODEN PANEL WHICH WAS NO LONGER THAN IT
WAS BROAD STOOD ON THE GROUND AND RESTED IN A SLOPING ATTITUDE AGAINST
THE WALL
IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A PICTURE WITH ITS FACE TURNED TO
THE WALL OF A FRAME PROBABLY SHOWING A DAUB ON THE OTHER SIDE OF SOME
PIER GLASS DETACHED FROM A WALL AND LYING FORGOTTEN THERE WHILE WAITING
TO BE REHUNG
NEAR THE TABLE UPON WHICH MARIUS DESCRIED A PEN INK AND PAPER SAT
A MAN ABOUT SIXTY YEARS OF AGE SMALL THIN LIVID HAGGARD WITH A
CUNNING CRUEL AND UNEASY AIR A HIDEOUS SCOUNDREL
IF LAVATER HAD STUDIED THIS VISAGE HE WOULD HAVE FOUND THE VULTURE
MINGLED WITH THE ATTORNEY THERE THE BIRD OF PREY AND THE PETTIFOGGER
RENDERING EACH OTHER MUTUALLY HIDEOUS AND COMPLEMENTING EACH OTHER THE
PETTIFOGGER MAKING THE BIRD OF PREY IGNOBLE THE BIRD OF PREY MAKING THE
PETTIFOGGER HORRIBLE
THIS MAN HAD A LONG GRAY BEARD
HE WAS CLAD IN A WOMAN'S CHEMISE WHICH
ALLOWED HIS HAIRY BREAST AND HIS BARE ARMS BRISTLING WITH GRAY HAIR
TO BE SEEN
BENEATH THIS CHEMISE MUDDY TROUSERS AND BOOTS THROUGH WHICH
HIS TOES PROJECTED WERE VISIBLE
HE HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SMOKING
THERE WAS NO BREAD IN THE
HOVEL BUT THERE WAS STILL TOBACCO
HE WAS WRITING PROBABLY SOME MORE LETTERS LIKE THOSE WHICH MARIUS HAD

ON THE CORNER OF THE TABLE LAY AN ANCIENT DILAPIDATED REDDISH VOLUME
AND THE SIZE WHICH WAS THE ANTIQUE 12MO OF READING ROOMS BETRAYED A
ROMANCE
ON THE COVER SPRAWLED THE FOLLOWING TITLE PRINTED IN LARGE
CAPITALS GOD THE KING HONOR AND THE LADIES BY DUCRAY DUMINIL 1814
AS THE MAN WROTE HE TALKED ALOUD AND MARIUS HEARD HIS WORDS
THE IDEA THAT THERE IS NO EQUALITY EVEN WHEN YOU ARE DEAD JUST LOOK
AT PERE LACHAISE THE GREAT THOSE WHO ARE RICH ARE UP ABOVE IN THE
ACACIA ALLEY WHICH IS PAVED
THEY CAN REACH IT IN A CARRIAGE
THE
LITTLE PEOPLE THE POOR THE UNHAPPY WELL WHAT OF THEM THEY ARE PUT
DOWN BELOW WHERE THE MUD IS UP TO YOUR KNEES IN THE DAMP PLACES
THEY
ARE PUT THERE SO THAT THEY WILL DECAY THE SOONER YOU CANNOT GO TO SEE
THEM WITHOUT SINKING INTO THE EARTH
HE PAUSED SMOTE THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST AND ADDED AS HE GROUND HIS
TEETH
OH I COULD EAT THE WHOLE WORLD
A BIG WOMAN WHO MIGHT BE FORTY YEARS OF AGE OR A HUNDRED WAS
CROUCHING NEAR THE FIREPLACE ON HER BARE HEELS
SHE TOO WAS CLAD ONLY IN A CHEMISE AND A KNITTED PETTICOAT PATCHED
WITH BITS OF OLD CLOTH
A COARSE LINEN APRON CONCEALED THE HALF OF HER
PETTICOAT
ALTHOUGH THIS WOMAN WAS DOUBLED UP AND BENT TOGETHER IT
COULD BE SEEN THAT SHE WAS OF VERY LOFTY STATURE
SHE WAS A SORT OF
GIANT BESIDE HER HUSBAND
SHE HAD HIDEOUS HAIR OF A REDDISH BLOND
WHICH WAS TURNING GRAY AND WHICH SHE THRUST BACK FROM TIME TO TIME
WITH HER ENORMOUS SHINING HANDS WITH THEIR FLAT NAILS
BESIDE HER ON THE FLOOR WIDE OPEN LAY A BOOK OF THE SAME FORM AS THE
OTHER AND PROBABLY A VOLUME OF THE SAME ROMANCE
ON ONE OF THE PALLETS MARIUS CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A SORT OF TALL PALE
YOUNG GIRL WHO SAT THERE HALF NAKED AND WITH PENDANT FEET AND WHO DID
NOT SEEM TO BE LISTENING OR SEEING OR LIVING
NO DOUBT THE YOUNGER SISTER OF THE ONE WHO HAD COME TO HIS ROOM
SHE SEEMED TO BE ELEVEN OR TWELVE YEARS OF AGE
ON CLOSER SCRUTINY IT
WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE REALLY WAS FOURTEEN
SHE WAS THE CHILD WHO HAD
SAID ON THE BOULEVARD THE EVENING BEFORE I BOLTED BOLTED BOLTED
SHE WAS OF THAT PUNY SORT WHICH REMAINS BACKWARD FOR A LONG TIME
THEN SUDDENLY STARTS UP RAPIDLY
IT IS INDIGENCE WHICH PRODUCES THESE
MELANCHOLY HUMAN PLANTS
THESE CREATURES HAVE NEITHER CHILDHOOD NOR
YOUTH
AT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE THEY APPEAR TO BE TWELVE AT SIXTEEN THEY
SEEM TWENTY
TO DAY A LITTLE GIRL TO MORROW A WOMAN
ONE MIGHT SAY
THAT THEY STRIDE THROUGH LIFE IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH WITH IT THE MORE
SPEEDILY
AT THIS MOMENT THIS BEING HAD THE AIR OF A CHILD
MOREOVER NO TRACE OF WORK WAS REVEALED IN THAT DWELLING NO HANDICRAFT
NO SPINNING WHEEL NOT A TOOL
IN ONE CORNER LAY SOME IRONMONGERY OF
DUBIOUS ASPECT
IT WAS THE DULL LISTLESSNESS WHICH FOLLOWS DESPAIR AND
PRECEDES THE DEATH AGONY
MARIUS GAZED FOR A WHILE AT THIS GLOOMY INTERIOR MORE TERRIFYING THAN
THE INTERIOR OF A TOMB FOR THE HUMAN SOUL COULD BE FELT FLUTTERING
THERE AND LIFE WAS PALPITATING THERE
THE GARRET THE CELLAR THE LOWLY
DITCH WHERE CERTAIN INDIGENT WRETCHES CRAWL AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE
SOCIAL EDIFICE IS NOT EXACTLY THE SEPULCHRE BUT ONLY ITS ANTECHAMBER
BUT AS THE WEALTHY DISPLAY THEIR GREATEST MAGNIFICENCE AT THE ENTRANCE
OF THEIR PALACES IT SEEMS THAT DEATH WHICH STANDS DIRECTLY SIDE BY
SIDE WITH THEM PLACES ITS GREATEST MISERIES IN THAT VESTIBULE
THE MAN HELD HIS PEACE THE WOMAN SPOKE NO WORD THE YOUNG GIRL DID
NOT EVEN SEEM TO BREATHE
THE SCRATCHING OF THE PEN ON THE PAPER WAS
AUDIBLE
THE MAN GRUMBLED WITHOUT PAUSING IN HIS WRITING
CANAILLE CANAILLE
EVERYBODY IS CANAILLE
THIS VARIATION TO SOLOMON'S EXCLAMATION ELICITED A SIGH FROM THE WOMAN
CALM YOURSELF MY LITTLE FRIEND SHE SAID
DON'T HURT YOURSELF MY
DEAR
YOU ARE TOO GOOD TO WRITE TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE HUSBAND
BODIES PRESS CLOSE TO EACH OTHER IN MISERY AS IN COLD BUT HEARTS DRAW
APART
THIS WOMAN MUST HAVE LOVED THIS MAN TO ALL APPEARANCE JUDGING
FROM THE AMOUNT OF LOVE WITHIN HER BUT PROBABLY IN THE DAILY AND
RECIPROCAL REPROACHES OF THE HORRIBLE DISTRESS WHICH WEIGHED ON THE
WHOLE GROUP THIS HAD BECOME EXTINCT
THERE NO LONGER EXISTED IN HER
ANYTHING MORE THAN THE ASHES OF AFFECTION FOR HER HUSBAND
NEVERTHELESS
CARESSING APPELLATIONS HAD SURVIVED AS IS OFTEN THE CASE
SHE CALLED
HIM MY DEAR MY LITTLE FRIEND MY GOOD MAN ETC WITH HER MOUTH WHILE
HER HEART WAS SILENT
THE MAN RESUMED HIS WRITING
CHAPTER VII STRATEGY AND TACTICS
MARIUS WITH A LOAD UPON HIS BREAST WAS ON THE POINT OF DESCENDING
FROM THE SPECIES OF OBSERVATORY WHICH HE HAD IMPROVISED WHEN A SOUND
ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION AND CAUSED HIM TO REMAIN AT HIS POST
THE DOOR OF THE ATTIC HAD JUST BURST OPEN ABRUPTLY
THE ELDEST GIRL MADE
HER APPEARANCE ON THE THRESHOLD
ON HER FEET SHE HAD LARGE COARSE
MEN'S SHOES BESPATTERED WITH MUD WHICH HAD SPLASHED EVEN TO HER RED
ANKLES AND SHE WAS WRAPPED IN AN OLD MANTLE WHICH HUNG IN TATTERS
MARIUS HAD NOT SEEN IT ON HER AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY BUT SHE HAD PROBABLY
DEPOSITED IT AT HIS DOOR IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT INSPIRE THE MORE PITY
AND HAD PICKED IT UP AGAIN ON EMERGING
SHE ENTERED PUSHED THE DOOR TO
BEHIND HER PAUSED TO TAKE BREATH FOR SHE WAS COMPLETELY BREATHLESS
THEN EXCLAIMED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF TRIUMPH AND JOY
HE IS COMING
THE FATHER TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS HER THE WOMAN TURNED HER HEAD THE
LITTLE SISTER DID NOT STIR
WHO DEMANDED HER FATHER
THE GENTLEMAN
THE PHILANTHROPIST
YES
FROM THE CHURCH OF SAINT JACQUES
YES
THAT OLD FELLOW
YES
AND HE IS COMING
HE IS FOLLOWING ME
YOU ARE SURE
I AM SURE
THERE TRULY HE IS COMING
HE IS COMING IN A FIACRE
IN A FIACRE
HE IS ROTHSCHILD
THE FATHER ROSE
HOW ARE YOU SURE IF HE IS COMING IN A FIACRE HOW IS IT THAT YOU
ARRIVE BEFORE HIM YOU GAVE HIM OUR ADDRESS AT LEAST DID YOU TELL HIM
THAT IT WAS THE LAST DOOR AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR ON THE RIGHT IF
HE ONLY DOES NOT MAKE A MISTAKE SO YOU FOUND HIM AT THE CHURCH DID HE
READ MY LETTER WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU
TA TA TA SAID THE GIRL HOW YOU DO GALLOP ON MY GOOD MAN SEE
HERE I ENTERED THE CHURCH HE WAS IN HIS USUAL PLACE I MADE HIM A
REVERENCE AND I HANDED HIM THE LETTER HE READ IT AND SAID TO ME
'WHERE DO YOU LIVE MY CHILD I SAID 'MONSIEUR I WILL SHOW YOU HE
SAID TO ME 'NO GIVE ME YOUR ADDRESS MY DAUGHTER HAS SOME PURCHASES TO
MAKE I WILL TAKE A CARRIAGE AND REACH YOUR HOUSE AT THE SAME TIME THAT
YOU DO I GAVE HIM THE ADDRESS
WHEN I MENTIONED THE HOUSE HE SEEMED
SURPRISED AND HESITATED FOR AN INSTANT THEN HE SAID 'NEVER MIND I
WILL COME WHEN THE MASS WAS FINISHED I WATCHED HIM LEAVE THE CHURCH
WITH HIS DAUGHTER AND I SAW THEM ENTER A CARRIAGE
I CERTAINLY DID TELL
HIM THE LAST DOOR IN THE CORRIDOR ON THE RIGHT
AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT HE WILL COME
I HAVE JUST SEEN THE FIACRE TURN INTO THE RUE PETIT BANQUIER
THAT IS
WHAT MADE ME RUN SO
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS THE SAME FIACRE
BECAUSE I TOOK NOTICE OF THE NUMBER SO THERE
WHAT WAS THE NUMBER
440
GOOD YOU ARE A CLEVER GIRL
THE GIRL STARED BOLDLY AT HER FATHER AND SHOWING THE SHOES WHICH SHE
HAD ON HER FEET
A CLEVER GIRL POSSIBLY BUT I TELL YOU I WON'T PUT THESE SHOES ON
AGAIN AND THAT I WON'T FOR THE SAKE OF MY HEALTH IN THE FIRST PLACE
AND FOR THE SAKE OF CLEANLINESS IN THE NEXT
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
MORE IRRITATING THAN SHOES THAT SQUELCH AND GO GHI GHI GHI THE WHOLE
TIME
I PREFER TO GO BAREFOOT
YOU ARE RIGHT SAID HER FATHER IN A SWEET TONE WHICH CONTRASTED WITH
THE YOUNG GIRL'S RUDENESS BUT THEN YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO ENTER
CHURCHES FOR POOR PEOPLE MUST HAVE SHOES TO DO THAT
ONE CANNOT GO
BAREFOOT TO THE GOOD GOD HE ADDED BITTERLY
THEN RETURNING TO THE SUBJECT WHICH ABSORBED HIM
SO YOU ARE SURE THAT HE WILL COME
HE IS FOLLOWING ON MY HEELS SAID SHE
THE MAN STARTED UP
A SORT OF ILLUMINATION APPEARED ON HIS COUNTENANCE
WIFE HE EXCLAIMED YOU HEAR
HERE IS THE PHILANTHROPIST
EXTINGUISH
THE FIRE
THE STUPEFIED MOTHER DID NOT STIR
THE FATHER WITH THE AGILITY OF AN ACROBAT SEIZED A BROKEN NOSED JUG
WHICH STOOD ON THE CHIMNEY AND FLUNG THE WATER ON THE BRANDS
THEN ADDRESSING HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER
HERE YOU PULL THE STRAW OFF THAT CHAIR
HIS DAUGHTER DID NOT UNDERSTAND
HE SEIZED THE CHAIR AND WITH ONE KICK HE RENDERED IT SEATLESS
HIS LEG
PASSED THROUGH IT
AS HE WITHDREW HIS LEG HE ASKED HIS DAUGHTER
IS IT COLD
VERY COLD
IT IS SNOWING
THE FATHER TURNED TOWARDS THE YOUNGER GIRL WHO SAT ON THE BED NEAR THE
WINDOW AND SHOUTED TO HER IN A THUNDERING VOICE
QUICK GET OFF THAT BED YOU LAZY THING WILL YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING
BREAK A PANE OF GLASS
THE LITTLE GIRL JUMPED OFF THE BED WITH A SHIVER
BREAK A PANE HE REPEATED
THE CHILD STOOD STILL IN BEWILDERMENT
DO YOU HEAR ME REPEATED HER FATHER I TELL YOU TO BREAK A PANE
THE CHILD WITH A SORT OF TERRIFIED OBEDIENCE ROSE ON TIPTOE AND
STRUCK A PANE WITH HER FIST
THE GLASS BROKE AND FELL WITH A LOUD
CLATTER
GOOD SAID THE FATHER
HE WAS GRAVE AND ABRUPT
HIS GLANCE SWEPT RAPIDLY OVER ALL THE CRANNIES
OF THE GARRET
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS A GENERAL MAKING THE
FINAL PREPARATION AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE BATTLE IS ON THE POINT OF
BEGINNING
THE MOTHER WHO HAD NOT SAID A WORD SO FAR NOW ROSE AND DEMANDED IN
A DULL SLOW LANGUID VOICE WHENCE HER WORDS SEEMED TO EMERGE IN A
CONGEALED STATE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO MY DEAR
GET INTO BED REPLIED THE MAN
HIS INTONATION ADMITTED OF NO DELIBERATION
THE MOTHER OBEYED AND THREW
HERSELF HEAVILY ON ONE OF THE PALLETS
IN THE MEANTIME A SOB BECAME AUDIBLE IN ONE CORNER
WHAT'S THAT CRIED THE FATHER
THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER EXHIBITED HER BLEEDING FIST WITHOUT QUITTING THE
CORNER IN WHICH SHE WAS COWERING
SHE HAD WOUNDED HERSELF WHILE BREAKING
THE WINDOW SHE WENT OFF NEAR HER MOTHER'S PALLET AND WEPT SILENTLY
IT WAS NOW THE MOTHER'S TURN TO START UP AND EXCLAIM
JUST SEE THERE WHAT FOLLIES YOU COMMIT SHE HAS CUT HERSELF BREAKING
THAT PANE FOR YOU
SO MUCH THE BETTER SAID THE MAN
I FORESAW THAT
WHAT SO MUCH THE BETTER RETORTED HIS WIFE
PEACE REPLIED THE FATHER I SUPPRESS THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS
THEN TEARING THE WOMAN'S CHEMISE WHICH HE WAS WEARING HE MADE A STRIP
OF CLOTH WITH WHICH HE HASTILY SWATHED THE LITTLE GIRL'S BLEEDING WRIST
THAT DONE HIS EYE FELL WITH A SATISFIED EXPRESSION ON HIS TORN CHEMISE
AND THE CHEMISE TOO SAID HE THIS HAS A GOOD APPEARANCE
AN ICY BREEZE WHISTLED THROUGH THE WINDOW AND ENTERED THE ROOM
THE
OUTER MIST PENETRATED THITHER AND DIFFUSED ITSELF LIKE A WHITISH SHEET
OF WADDING VAGUELY SPREAD BY INVISIBLE FINGERS
THROUGH THE BROKEN PANE
THE SNOW COULD BE SEEN FALLING
THE SNOW PROMISED BY THE CANDLEMAS SUN
OF THE PRECEDING DAY HAD ACTUALLY COME
THE FATHER CAST A GLANCE ABOUT HIM AS THOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT HE HAD
FORGOTTEN NOTHING
HE SEIZED AN OLD SHOVEL AND SPREAD ASHES OVER THE WET
BRANDS IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO ENTIRELY CONCEAL THEM
THEN DRAWING HIMSELF UP AND LEANING AGAINST THE CHIMNEY PIECE
NOW SAID HE WE CAN RECEIVE THE PHILANTHROPIST
CHAPTER VIII THE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVEL
THE BIG GIRL APPROACHED AND LAID HER HAND IN HER FATHER'S
FEEL HOW COLD I AM SAID SHE
BAH REPLIED THE FATHER I AM MUCH COLDER THAN THAT
THE MOTHER EXCLAIMED IMPETUOUSLY
YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE SO YOU DO EVEN BAD
THINGS
DOWN WITH YOU SAID THE MAN
THE MOTHER BEING EYED AFTER A CERTAIN FASHION HELD HER TONGUE
SILENCE REIGNED FOR A MOMENT IN THE HOVEL
THE ELDER GIRL WAS REMOVING
THE MUD FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER MANTLE WITH A CARELESS AIR HER YOUNGER
SISTER CONTINUED TO SOB THE MOTHER HAD TAKEN THE LATTER'S HEAD BETWEEN
HER HANDS AND WAS COVERING IT WITH KISSES WHISPERING TO HER THE
WHILE
MY TREASURE I ENTREAT YOU IT IS NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE DON'T CRY
YOU WILL ANGER YOUR FATHER
NO EXCLAIMED THE FATHER QUITE THE CONTRARY SOB SOB THAT'S
RIGHT
THEN TURNING TO THE ELDER
THERE NOW HE IS NOT COMING WHAT IF HE WERE NOT TO COME I SHALL HAVE
EXTINGUISHED MY FIRE WRECKED MY CHAIR TORN MY SHIRT AND BROKEN MY
PANE ALL FOR NOTHING
AND WOUNDED THE CHILD MURMURED THE MOTHER
DO YOU KNOW WENT ON THE FATHER THAT IT'S BEASTLY COLD IN THIS
DEVIL'S GARRET WHAT IF THAT MAN SHOULD NOT COME OH SEE THERE YOU HE
MAKES US WAIT HE SAYS TO HIMSELF 'WELL THEY WILL WAIT FOR ME
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THERE FOR OH HOW I HATE THEM AND WITH WHAT JOY
JUBILATION ENTHUSIASM AND SATISFACTION I COULD STRANGLE ALL THOSE RICH
FOLKS ALL THOSE RICH FOLKS THESE MEN WHO PRETEND TO BE CHARITABLE
WHO PUT ON AIRS WHO GO TO MASS WHO MAKE PRESENTS TO THE PRIESTHOOD
PREACHY PREACHY IN THEIR SKULLCAPS AND WHO THINK THEMSELVES ABOVE

'CLOTHES AS THEY SAY OLD DUDS THAT ARE NOT WORTH FOUR SOUS AND
BREAD THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT PACK OF RASCALS THAT THEY ARE IT'S
MONEY AH MONEY NEVER BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT WE WOULD GO OFF AND DRINK
IT UP AND THAT WE ARE DRUNKARDS AND IDLERS AND THEY WHAT ARE THEY
THEN AND WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN IN THEIR TIME THIEVES THEY NEVER COULD
HAVE BECOME RICH OTHERWISE OH SOCIETY OUGHT TO BE GRASPED BY THE FOUR
CORNERS OF THE CLOTH AND TOSSED INTO THE AIR ALL OF IT IT WOULD ALL
BE SMASHED VERY LIKELY BUT AT LEAST NO ONE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING
AND THERE WOULD BE THAT MUCH GAINED BUT WHAT IS THAT BLOCKHEAD OF
A BENEVOLENT GENTLEMAN DOING WILL HE COME PERHAPS THE ANIMAL HAS
FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS I'LL BET THAT THAT OLD BEAST
AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME A LIGHT TAP AT THE DOOR THE MAN RUSHED TO IT
AND OPENED IT EXCLAIMING AMID PROFOUND BOWS AND SMILES OF ADORATION
ENTER SIR DEIGN TO ENTER MOST RESPECTED BENEFACTOR AND YOUR
CHARMING YOUNG LADY ALSO
A MAN OF RIPE AGE AND A YOUNG GIRL MADE THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE
THRESHOLD OF THE ATTIC
MARIUS HAD NOT QUITTED HIS POST
HIS FEELINGS FOR THE MOMENT SURPASSED
THE POWERS OF THE HUMAN TONGUE
IT WAS SHE
WHOEVER HAS LOVED KNOWS ALL THE RADIANT MEANINGS CONTAINED IN THOSE
THREE LETTERS OF THAT WORD SHE
IT WAS CERTAINLY SHE
MARIUS COULD HARDLY DISTINGUISH HER THROUGH THE
LUMINOUS VAPOR WHICH HAD SUDDENLY SPREAD BEFORE HIS EYES
IT WAS THAT
SWEET ABSENT BEING THAT STAR WHICH HAD BEAMED UPON HIM FOR SIX MONTHS
IT WAS THOSE EYES THAT BROW THAT MOUTH THAT LOVELY VANISHED FACE
WHICH HAD CREATED NIGHT BY ITS DEPARTURE
THE VISION HAD BEEN ECLIPSED
NOW IT REAPPEARED
IT REAPPEARED IN THAT GLOOM IN THAT GARRET IN THAT MISSHAPEN ATTIC IN
ALL THAT HORROR
MARIUS SHUDDERED IN DISMAY
WHAT IT WAS SHE THE PALPITATIONS OF HIS
HEART TROUBLED HIS SIGHT
HE FELT THAT HE WAS ON THE BRINK OF BURSTING
INTO TEARS WHAT HE BEHELD HER AGAIN AT LAST AFTER HAVING SOUGHT HER
SO LONG IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD LOST HIS SOUL AND THAT HE HAD
JUST FOUND IT AGAIN
SHE WAS THE SAME AS EVER ONLY A LITTLE PALE HER DELICATE FACE WAS
FRAMED IN A BONNET OF VIOLET VELVET HER FIGURE WAS CONCEALED BENEATH
A PELISSE OF BLACK SATIN
BENEATH HER LONG DRESS A GLIMPSE COULD BE
CAUGHT OF HER TINY FOOT SHOD IN A SILKEN BOOT
SHE WAS STILL ACCOMPANIED BY M
LEBLANC
SHE HAD TAKEN A FEW STEPS INTO THE ROOM AND HAD DEPOSITED A TOLERABLY
BULKY PARCEL ON THE TABLE
THE ELDEST JONDRETTE GIRL HAD RETIRED BEHIND THE DOOR AND WAS STARING
WITH SOMBRE EYES AT THAT VELVET BONNET THAT SILK MANTLE AND THAT
CHARMING HAPPY FACE
CHAPTER IX JONDRETTE COMES NEAR WEEPING
THE HOVEL WAS SO DARK THAT PEOPLE COMING FROM WITHOUT FELT ON ENTERING
IT THE EFFECT PRODUCED ON ENTERING A CELLAR
THE TWO NEW COMERS
ADVANCED THEREFORE WITH A CERTAIN HESITATION BEING HARDLY ABLE
TO DISTINGUISH THE VAGUE FORMS SURROUNDING THEM WHILE THEY COULD BE
CLEARLY SEEN AND SCRUTINIZED BY THE EYES OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE
GARRET WHO WERE ACCUSTOMED TO THIS TWILIGHT
M
LEBLANC APPROACHED WITH HIS SAD BUT KINDLY LOOK AND SAID TO
JONDRETTE THE FATHER
MONSIEUR IN THIS PACKAGE YOU WILL FIND SOME NEW CLOTHES AND SOME
WOOLLEN STOCKINGS AND BLANKETS
OUR ANGELIC BENEFACTOR OVERWHELMS US SAID JONDRETTE BOWING TO THE
VERY EARTH
THEN BENDING DOWN TO THE EAR OF HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER WHILE THE TWO
VISITORS WERE ENGAGED IN EXAMINING THIS LAMENTABLE INTERIOR HE ADDED IN
A LOW AND RAPID VOICE
HEY WHAT DID I SAY DUDS NO MONEY THEY ARE ALL ALIKE BY THE WAY
HOW WAS THE LETTER TO THAT OLD BLOCKHEAD SIGNED
FABANTOU REPLIED THE GIRL
THE DRAMATIC ARTIST GOOD
IT WAS LUCKY FOR JONDRETTE THAT THIS HAD OCCURRED TO HIM FOR AT THE
VERY MOMENT M
LEBLANC TURNED TO HIM AND SAID TO HIM WITH THE AIR OF A
PERSON WHO IS SEEKING TO RECALL A NAME
I SEE THAT YOU ARE GREATLY TO BE PITIED MONSIEUR
FABANTOU REPLIED JONDRETTE QUICKLY
MONSIEUR FABANTOU YES THAT IS IT
I REMEMBER
DRAMATIC ARTIST SIR AND ONE WHO HAS HAD SOME SUCCESS
HERE JONDRETTE EVIDENTLY JUDGED THE MOMENT PROPITIOUS FOR CAPTURING THE
PHILANTHROPIST HE EXCLAIMED WITH AN ACCENT WHICH SMACKED AT THE SAME
TIME OF THE VAINGLORY OF THE MOUNTEBANK AT FAIRS AND THE HUMILITY OF
THE MENDICANT ON THE HIGHWAY
A PUPIL OF TALMA SIR I AM A PUPIL OF TALMA FORTUNE FORMERLY SMILED
ON ME ALAS NOW IT IS MISFORTUNE'S TURN
YOU SEE MY BENEFACTOR NO
BREAD NO FIRE

BROKEN PANE AND IN SUCH WEATHER MY SPOUSE IN BED ILL
POOR WOMAN SAID M
LEBLANC
MY CHILD WOUNDED ADDED JONDRETTE
THE CHILD DIVERTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF THE STRANGERS HAD FALLEN TO
CONTEMPLATING THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD CEASED TO SOB
CRY BAWL SAID JONDRETTE TO HER IN A LOW VOICE
AT THE SAME TIME HE PINCHED HER SORE HAND
ALL THIS WAS DONE WITH THE
TALENT OF A JUGGLER
THE LITTLE GIRL GAVE VENT TO LOUD SHRIEKS
THE ADORABLE YOUNG GIRL WHOM MARIUS IN HIS HEART CALLED HIS URSULE
APPROACHED HER HASTILY
POOR DEAR CHILD SAID SHE
YOU SEE MY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY PURSUED JONDRETTE HER BLEEDING
WRIST IT CAME THROUGH AN ACCIDENT WHILE WORKING AT A MACHINE TO EARN
SIX SOUS A DAY
IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO CUT OFF HER ARM
REALLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN ALARM
THE LITTLE GIRL TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY FELL TO SOBBING MORE VIOLENTLY
THAN EVER
ALAS YES MY BENEFACTOR REPLIED THE FATHER
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES JONDRETTE HAD BEEN SCRUTINIZING THE BENEFACTOR
IN A SINGULAR FASHION
AS HE SPOKE HE SEEMED TO BE EXAMINING THE OTHER
ATTENTIVELY AS THOUGH SEEKING TO SUMMON UP HIS RECOLLECTIONS
ALL AT
ONCE PROFITING BY A MOMENT WHEN THE NEW COMERS WERE QUESTIONING THE
CHILD WITH INTEREST AS TO HER INJURED HAND HE PASSED NEAR HIS WIFE
WHO LAY IN HER BED WITH A STUPID AND DEJECTED AIR AND SAID TO HER IN A
RAPID BUT VERY LOW TONE
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT MAN
THEN TURNING TO M
LEBLANC AND CONTINUING HIS LAMENTATIONS
YOU SEE SIR ALL THE CLOTHING THAT I HAVE IS MY WIFE'S CHEMISE AND
ALL TORN AT THAT IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER I CAN'T GO OUT FOR LACK OF A
COAT

THERE SIR
I OWE FOR FOUR QUARTERS A WHOLE YEAR THAT IS TO SAY SIXTY
FRANCS
JONDRETTE LIED
FOUR QUARTERS WOULD HAVE AMOUNTED TO ONLY FORTY FRANCS
AND HE COULD NOT OWE FOUR BECAUSE SIX MONTHS HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE
MARIUS HAD PAID FOR TWO
M
LEBLANC DREW FIVE FRANCS FROM HIS POCKET AND THREW THEM ON THE TABLE
JONDRETTE FOUND TIME TO MUTTER IN THE EAR OF HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER
THE SCOUNDREL WHAT DOES HE THINK I CAN DO WITH HIS FIVE FRANCS
THAT WON'T PAY ME FOR MY CHAIR AND PANE OF GLASS THAT'S WHAT COMES OF
INCURRING EXPENSES
IN THE MEANWHILE M
LEBLANC HAD REMOVED THE LARGE BROWN GREAT COAT

CHAIR
MONSIEUR FABANTOU HE SAID THESE FIVE FRANCS ARE ALL THAT I HAVE
ABOUT ME BUT I SHALL NOW TAKE MY DAUGHTER HOME AND I WILL RETURN THIS
EVENING IT IS THIS EVENING THAT YOU MUST PAY IS IT NOT
JONDRETTE'S FACE LIGHTED UP WITH A STRANGE EXPRESSION
HE REPLIED
VIVACIOUSLY

MY BENEFACTOR EXCLAIMED JONDRETTE OVERWHELMED
AND HE ADDED IN A
LOW TONE TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT HIM WIFE
M
LEBLANC HAD TAKEN THE ARM OF THE YOUNG GIRL ONCE MORE AND HAD
TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR
FAREWELL UNTIL THIS EVENING MY FRIENDS SAID HE
SIX O'CLOCK SAID JONDRETTE
SIX O'CLOCK PRECISELY
AT THAT MOMENT THE OVERCOAT LYING ON THE CHAIR CAUGHT THE EYE OF THE
ELDER JONDRETTE GIRL
YOU ARE FORGETTING YOUR COAT SIR SAID SHE
JONDRETTE DARTED AN ANNIHILATING LOOK AT HIS DAUGHTER ACCOMPANIED BY A
FORMIDABLE SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS
M
LEBLANC TURNED BACK AND SAID WITH A SMILE
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN IT I AM LEAVING IT
O MY PROTECTOR SAID JONDRETTE MY AUGUST BENEFACTOR I MELT INTO
TEARS PERMIT ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU TO YOUR CARRIAGE
IF YOU COME OUT ANSWERED M
LEBLANC PUT ON THIS COAT
IT REALLY IS
VERY COLD
JONDRETTE DID NOT NEED TO BE TOLD TWICE
HE HASTILY DONNED THE BROWN
GREAT COAT
AND ALL THREE WENT OUT JONDRETTE PRECEDING THE TWO
STRANGERS
CHAPTER X TARIFF OF LICENSED CABS TWO FRANCS AN HOUR
MARIUS HAD LOST NOTHING OF THIS ENTIRE SCENE AND YET IN REALITY HAD
SEEN NOTHING
HIS EYES HAD REMAINED FIXED ON THE YOUNG GIRL HIS HEART
HAD SO TO SPEAK SEIZED HER AND WHOLLY ENVELOPED HER FROM THE MOMENT OF
HER VERY FIRST STEP IN THAT GARRET
DURING HER ENTIRE STAY THERE HE
HAD LIVED THAT LIFE OF ECSTASY WHICH SUSPENDS MATERIAL PERCEPTIONS AND
PRECIPITATES THE WHOLE SOUL ON A SINGLE POINT
HE CONTEMPLATED NOT THAT
GIRL BUT THAT LIGHT WHICH WORE A SATIN PELISSE AND A VELVET BONNET
THE
STAR SIRIUS MIGHT HAVE ENTERED THE ROOM AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY
MORE DAZZLED
WHILE THE YOUNG GIRL WAS ENGAGED IN OPENING THE PACKAGE UNFOLDING THE
CLOTHING AND THE BLANKETS QUESTIONING THE SICK MOTHER KINDLY AND THE
LITTLE INJURED GIRL TENDERLY HE WATCHED HER EVERY MOVEMENT HE SOUGHT
TO CATCH HER WORDS
HE KNEW HER EYES HER BROW HER BEAUTY HER FORM
HER WALK HE DID NOT KNOW THE SOUND OF HER VOICE
HE HAD ONCE FANCIED
THAT HE HAD CAUGHT A FEW WORDS AT THE LUXEMBOURG BUT HE WAS NOT
ABSOLUTELY SURE OF THE FACT
HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN TEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE
TO HEAR IT IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BEAR AWAY IN HIS SOUL A LITTLE OF
THAT MUSIC
BUT EVERYTHING WAS DROWNED IN THE LAMENTABLE EXCLAMATIONS
AND TRUMPET BURSTS OF JONDRETTE
THIS ADDED A TOUCH OF GENUINE WRATH
TO MARIUS' ECSTASY
HE DEVOURED HER WITH HIS EYES
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE
THAT IT REALLY WAS THAT DIVINE CREATURE WHOM HE SAW IN THE MIDST OF
THOSE VILE CREATURES IN THAT MONSTROUS LAIR
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE
BEHELD A HUMMING BIRD IN THE MIDST OF TOADS
WHEN SHE TOOK HER DEPARTURE HE HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT TO FOLLOW HER TO
CLING TO HER TRACE NOT TO QUIT HER UNTIL HE LEARNED WHERE SHE
LIVED NOT TO LOSE HER AGAIN AT LEAST AFTER HAVING SO MIRACULOUSLY
RE DISCOVERED HER
HE LEAPED DOWN FROM THE COMMODE AND SEIZED HIS HAT
AS HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE LOCK OF THE DOOR AND WAS ON THE POINT OF
OPENING IT A SUDDEN REFLECTION CAUSED HIM TO PAUSE
THE CORRIDOR WAS
LONG THE STAIRCASE STEEP JONDRETTE WAS TALKATIVE M
LEBLANC HAD
NO DOUBT NOT YET REGAINED HIS CARRIAGE IF ON TURNING ROUND IN THE
CORRIDOR OR ON THE STAIRCASE HE WERE TO CATCH SIGHT OF HIM MARIUS
IN THAT HOUSE HE WOULD EVIDENTLY TAKE THE ALARM AND FIND MEANS TO
ESCAPE FROM HIM AGAIN AND THIS TIME IT WOULD BE FINAL
WHAT WAS HE
TO DO SHOULD HE WAIT A LITTLE BUT WHILE HE WAS WAITING THE CARRIAGE
MIGHT DRIVE OFF
MARIUS WAS PERPLEXED
AT LAST HE ACCEPTED THE RISK AND
QUITTED HIS ROOM
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE CORRIDOR
HE HASTENED TO THE STAIRS
THERE WAS
NO ONE ON THE STAIRCASE
HE DESCENDED IN ALL HASTE AND REACHED THE
BOULEVARD IN TIME TO SEE A FIACRE TURNING THE CORNER OF THE RUE DU
PETIT BANQUIER ON ITS WAY BACK TO PARIS
MARIUS RUSHED HEADLONG IN THAT DIRECTION
ON ARRIVING AT THE ANGLE OF
THE BOULEVARD HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE FIACRE AGAIN RAPIDLY DESCENDING
THE RUE MOUFFETARD THE CARRIAGE WAS ALREADY A LONG WAY OFF AND THERE
WAS NO MEANS OF OVERTAKING IT WHAT RUN AFTER IT IMPOSSIBLE AND
BESIDES THE PEOPLE IN THE CARRIAGE WOULD ASSUREDLY NOTICE AN INDIVIDUAL
RUNNING AT FULL SPEED IN PURSUIT OF A FIACRE AND THE FATHER WOULD
RECOGNIZE HIM
AT THAT MOMENT WONDERFUL AND UNPRECEDENTED GOOD LUCK
MARIUS PERCEIVED AN EMPTY CAB PASSING ALONG THE BOULEVARD
THERE WAS BUT
ONE THING TO BE DONE TO JUMP INTO THIS CAB AND FOLLOW THE FIACRE
THAT
WAS SURE EFFICACIOUS AND FREE FROM DANGER
MARIUS MADE THE DRIVER A SIGN TO HALT AND CALLED TO HIM
BY THE HOUR
MARIUS WORE NO CRAVAT HE HAD ON HIS WORKING COAT WHICH WAS DESTITUTE
OF BUTTONS HIS SHIRT WAS TORN ALONG ONE OF THE PLAITS ON THE BOSOM
THE DRIVER HALTED WINKED AND HELD OUT HIS LEFT HAND TO MARIUS RUBBING
HIS FOREFINGER GENTLY WITH HIS THUMB
WHAT IS IT SAID MARIUS
PAY IN ADVANCE SAID THE COACHMAN
MARIUS RECOLLECTED THAT HE HAD BUT SIXTEEN SOUS ABOUT HIM
HOW MUCH HE DEMANDED
FORTY SOUS
I WILL PAY ON MY RETURN
THE DRIVER'S ONLY REPLY WAS TO WHISTLE THE AIR OF LA PALISSE AND TO WHIP
UP HIS HORSE
MARIUS STARED AT THE RETREATING CABRIOLET WITH A BEWILDERED AIR
FOR THE
LACK OF FOUR AND TWENTY SOUS HE WAS LOSING HIS JOY HIS HAPPINESS
HIS LOVE HE HAD SEEN AND HE WAS BECOMING BLIND AGAIN
HE REFLECTED
BITTERLY AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED WITH PROFOUND REGRET ON THE FIVE
FRANCS WHICH HE HAD BESTOWED THAT VERY MORNING ON THAT MISERABLE GIRL
IF HE HAD HAD THOSE FIVE FRANCS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED HE WOULD HAVE
BEEN BORN AGAIN HE WOULD HAVE EMERGED FROM THE LIMBO AND DARKNESS HE
WOULD HAVE MADE HIS ESCAPE FROM ISOLATION AND SPLEEN FROM HIS WIDOWED
STATE HE MIGHT HAVE RE KNOTTED THE BLACK THREAD OF HIS DESTINY TO THAT
BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN THREAD WHICH HAD JUST FLOATED BEFORE HIS EYES AND
HAD BROKEN AT THE SAME INSTANT ONCE MORE HE RETURNED TO HIS HOVEL IN
DESPAIR
HE MIGHT HAVE TOLD HIMSELF THAT M
LEBLANC HAD PROMISED TO RETURN IN
THE EVENING AND THAT ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS TO SET ABOUT THE MATTER MORE
SKILFULLY SO THAT HE MIGHT FOLLOW HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT IN HIS
CONTEMPLATION IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE HAD HEARD THIS
AS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF MOUNTING THE STAIRCASE HE PERCEIVED ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD NEAR THE DESERTED WALL SKIRTING THE RUE DE
LA BARRIERE DES GOBELINS JONDRETTE WRAPPED IN THE PHILANTHROPIST'S
GREAT COAT ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THOSE MEN OF DISQUIETING
ASPECT WHO HAVE BEEN DUBBED BY COMMON CONSENT PROWLERS OF THE BARRIERS
PEOPLE OF EQUIVOCAL FACE OF SUSPICIOUS MONOLOGUES WHO PRESENT THE
AIR OF HAVING EVIL MINDS AND WHO GENERALLY SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME WHICH
SUGGESTS THE SUPPOSITION THAT THEY WORK BY NIGHT
THESE TWO MEN STANDING THERE MOTIONLESS AND IN CONVERSATION IN THE
SNOW WHICH WAS FALLING IN WHIRLWINDS FORMED A GROUP THAT A POLICEMAN
WOULD SURELY HAVE OBSERVED BUT WHICH MARIUS HARDLY NOTICED
STILL IN SPITE OF HIS MOURNFUL PREOCCUPATION HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM
SAYING TO HIMSELF THAT THIS PROWLER OF THE BARRIERS WITH WHOM JONDRETTE
WAS TALKING RESEMBLED A CERTAIN PANCHAUD ALIAS PRINTANIER ALIAS
BIGRENAILLE WHOM COURFEYRAC HAD ONCE POINTED OUT TO HIM AS A VERY
DANGEROUS NOCTURNAL ROAMER
THIS MAN'S NAME THE READER HAS LEARNED IN
THE PRECEDING BOOK
THIS PANCHAUD ALIAS PRINTANIER ALIAS BIGRENAILLE
FIGURED LATER ON IN MANY CRIMINAL TRIALS AND BECAME A NOTORIOUS RASCAL
HE WAS AT THAT TIME ONLY A FAMOUS RASCAL
TO DAY HE EXISTS IN THE STATE
OF TRADITION AMONG RUFFIANS AND ASSASSINS
HE WAS AT THE HEAD OF
A SCHOOL TOWARDS THE END OF THE LAST REIGN
AND IN THE EVENING AT
NIGHTFALL AT THE HOUR WHEN GROUPS FORM AND TALK IN WHISPERS HE WAS
DISCUSSED AT LA FORCE IN THE FOSSE AUX LIONS
ONE MIGHT EVEN IN
THAT PRISON PRECISELY AT THE SPOT WHERE THE SEWER WHICH SERVED THE
UNPRECEDENTED ESCAPE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT OF THIRTY PRISONERS IN 1843
PASSES UNDER THE CULVERT READ HIS NAME PANCHAUD AUDACIOUSLY CARVED
BY HIS OWN HAND ON THE WALL OF THE SEWER DURING ONE OF HIS ATTEMPTS AT
FLIGHT
IN 1832 THE POLICE ALREADY HAD THEIR EYE ON HIM BUT HE HAD NOT
AS YET MADE A SERIOUS BEGINNING
CHAPTER XI OFFERS OF SERVICE FROM MISERY TO WRETCHEDNESS
MARIUS ASCENDED THE STAIRS OF THE HOVEL WITH SLOW STEPS AT THE MOMENT
WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO RE ENTER HIS CELL HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE ELDER
JONDRETTE GIRL FOLLOWING HIM THROUGH THE CORRIDOR
THE VERY SIGHT OF
THIS GIRL WAS ODIOUS TO HIM IT WAS SHE WHO HAD HIS FIVE FRANCS IT WAS
TOO LATE TO DEMAND THEM BACK THE CAB WAS NO LONGER THERE THE FIACRE
WAS FAR AWAY
MOREOVER SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THEM BACK
AS FOR
QUESTIONING HER ABOUT THE RESIDENCE OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD JUST BEEN
THERE THAT WAS USELESS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW SINCE THE
LETTER SIGNED FABANTOU HAD BEEN ADDRESSED TO THE BENEVOLENT GENTLEMAN
OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT JACQUESDU HAUT PAS
MARIUS ENTERED HIS ROOM AND PUSHED THE DOOR TO AFTER HIM
IT DID NOT CLOSE HE TURNED ROUND AND BEHELD A HAND WHICH HELD THE DOOR
HALF OPEN
WHAT IS IT HE ASKED WHO IS THERE
IT WAS THE JONDRETTE GIRL
IS IT YOU RESUMED MARIUS ALMOST HARSHLY STILL YOU WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH ME
SHE APPEARED TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND DID NOT LOOK AT HIM
SHE NO LONGER HAD
THE AIR OF ASSURANCE WHICH HAD CHARACTERIZED HER THAT MORNING
SHE DID
NOT ENTER BUT HELD BACK IN THE DARKNESS OF THE CORRIDOR WHERE MARIUS
COULD SEE HER THROUGH THE HALF OPEN DOOR
COME NOW WILL YOU ANSWER CRIED MARIUS
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME
SHE RAISED HER DULL EYES IN WHICH A SORT OF GLEAM SEEMED TO FLICKER
VAGUELY AND SAID
MONSIEUR MARIUS YOU LOOK SAD
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU
WITH ME SAID MARIUS
YES YOU
THERE IS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH ME
YES THERE IS

LET ME ALONE
MARIUS GAVE THE DOOR ANOTHER PUSH BUT SHE RETAINED HER HOLD ON IT
STOP SAID SHE YOU ARE IN THE WRONG
ALTHOUGH YOU ARE NOT RICH YOU
WERE KIND THIS MORNING
BE SO AGAIN NOW
YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT
NOW TELL ME WHAT AILS YOU

WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR IT CAN I BE OF ANY SERVICE
EMPLOY ME
I DO NOT ASK FOR YOUR SECRETS YOU NEED NOT TELL THEM TO ME
BUT I MAY BE OF USE NEVERTHELESS
I MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU SINCE I
HELP MY FATHER
WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO CARRY LETTERS TO GO TO HOUSES
TO INQUIRE FROM DOOR TO DOOR TO FIND OUT AN ADDRESS TO FOLLOW ANY ONE
I AM OF SERVICE
WELL YOU MAY ASSUREDLY TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH
YOU AND I WILL GO AND SPEAK TO THE PERSONS SOMETIMES IT IS ENOUGH IF
SOME ONE SPEAKS TO THE PERSONS THAT SUFFICES TO LET THEM UNDERSTAND
MATTERS AND EVERYTHING COMES RIGHT
MAKE USE OF ME
AN IDEA FLASHED ACROSS MARIUS' MIND
WHAT BRANCH DOES ONE DISDAIN WHEN
ONE FEELS THAT ONE IS FALLING
HE DREW NEAR TO THE JONDRETTE GIRL
LISTEN HE SAID TO HER
SHE INTERRUPTED HIM WITH A GLEAM OF JOY IN HER EYES
OH YES DO CALL ME THOU I LIKE THAT BETTER
WELL HE RESUMED THOU HAST BROUGHT HITHER THAT OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS
DAUGHTER

NO

THE JONDRETTE'S DULL EYES HAD GROWN JOYOUS AND THEY NOW BECAME GLOOMY
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT SHE DEMANDED
YES
DO YOU KNOW THEM
NO
THAT IS TO SAY SHE RESUMED QUICKLY YOU DO NOT KNOW HER BUT YOU
WISH TO KNOW HER
THIS THEM WHICH HAD TURNED INTO HER HAD SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY
SIGNIFICANT AND BITTER ABOUT IT
WELL CAN YOU DO IT SAID MARIUS
YOU SHALL HAVE THE BEAUTIFUL LADY'S ADDRESS
THERE WAS STILL A SHADE IN THE WORDS THE BEAUTIFUL LADY WHICH TROUBLED
MARIUS
HE RESUMED
NEVER MIND AFTER ALL THE ADDRESS OF THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER
THEIR
ADDRESS INDEED
SHE GAZED FIXEDLY AT HIM
WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME
ANYTHING YOU LIKE
ANYTHING I LIKE
YES
YOU SHALL HAVE THE ADDRESS
SHE DROPPED HER HEAD THEN WITH A BRUSQUE MOVEMENT SHE PULLED TO THE
DOOR WHICH CLOSED BEHIND HER
MARIUS FOUND HIMSELF ALONE
HE DROPPED INTO A CHAIR WITH HIS HEAD AND BOTH ELBOWS ON HIS BED
ABSORBED IN THOUGHTS WHICH HE COULD NOT GRASP AND AS THOUGH A PREY TO
VERTIGO
ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE MORNING THE APPEARANCE OF
THE ANGEL HER DISAPPEARANCE WHAT THAT CREATURE HAD JUST SAID TO HIM A
GLEAM OF HOPE FLOATING IN AN IMMENSE DESPAIR THIS WAS WHAT FILLED HIS
BRAIN CONFUSEDLY
ALL AT ONCE HE WAS VIOLENTLY AROUSED FROM HIS REVERY
HE HEARD THE SHRILL HARD VOICE OF JONDRETTE UTTER THESE WORDS WHICH
WERE FRAUGHT WITH A STRANGE INTEREST FOR HIM
I TELL YOU THAT I AM SURE OF IT AND THAT I RECOGNIZED HIM
OF WHOM WAS JONDRETTE SPEAKING WHOM HAD HE RECOGNIZED M
LEBLANC THE
FATHER OF HIS URSULE WHAT DID JONDRETTE KNOW HIM WAS MARIUS ABOUT
TO OBTAIN IN THIS ABRUPT AND UNEXPECTED FASHION ALL THE INFORMATION
WITHOUT WHICH HIS LIFE WAS SO DARK TO HIM WAS HE ABOUT TO LEARN AT LAST
WHO IT WAS THAT HE LOVED WHO THAT YOUNG GIRL WAS WHO HER FATHER
WAS WAS THE DENSE SHADOW WHICH ENWRAPPED THEM ON THE POINT OF BEING
DISPELLED WAS THE VEIL ABOUT TO BE RENT AH HEAVENS
HE BOUNDED RATHER THAN CLIMBED UPON HIS COMMODE AND RESUMED HIS POST
NEAR THE LITTLE PEEP HOLE IN THE PARTITION WALL
AGAIN HE BEHELD THE INTERIOR OF JONDRETTE'S HOVEL
CHAPTER XII THE USE MADE OF M
LEBLANC'S FIVE FRANC PIECE
NOTHING IN THE ASPECT OF THE FAMILY WAS ALTERED EXCEPT THAT THE WIFE
AND DAUGHTERS HAD LEVIED ON THE PACKAGE AND PUT ON WOOLLEN STOCKINGS AND
JACKETS
TWO NEW BLANKETS WERE THROWN ACROSS THE TWO BEDS
JONDRETTE HAD EVIDENTLY JUST RETURNED
HE STILL HAD THE BREATHLESSNESS
OF OUT OF DOORS
HIS DAUGHTERS WERE SEATED ON THE FLOOR NEAR THE
FIREPLACE THE ELDER ENGAGED IN DRESSING THE YOUNGER'S WOUNDED HAND
HIS
WIFE HAD SUNK BACK ON THE BED NEAR THE FIREPLACE WITH A FACE INDICATIVE
OF ASTONISHMENT
JONDRETTE WAS PACING UP AND DOWN THE GARRET WITH LONG
STRIDES
HIS EYES WERE EXTRAORDINARY
THE WOMAN WHO SEEMED TIMID AND OVERWHELMED WITH STUPOR IN THE PRESENCE
OF HER HUSBAND TURNED TO SAY
WHAT REALLY YOU ARE SURE
SURE EIGHT YEARS HAVE PASSED BUT I RECOGNIZE HIM AH I RECOGNIZE
HIM
I KNEW HIM AT ONCE WHAT DIDN'T IT FORCE ITSELF ON YOU
NO
BUT I TOLD YOU 'PAY ATTENTION WHY IT IS HIS FIGURE IT IS HIS FACE
ONLY OLDER THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT GROW OLD I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY
MANAGE IT IT IS THE VERY SOUND OF HIS VOICE
HE IS BETTER DRESSED
THAT IS ALL AH YOU MYSTERIOUS OLD DEVIL I'VE GOT YOU THAT I HAVE
HE PAUSED AND SAID TO HIS DAUGHTERS
GET OUT OF HERE YOU IT'S QUEER THAT IT DIDN'T STRIKE YOU
THEY AROSE TO OBEY
THE MOTHER STAMMERED
WITH HER INJURED HAND
THE AIR WILL DO IT GOOD SAID JONDRETTE
BE OFF
IT WAS PLAIN THAT THIS MAN WAS OF THE SORT TO WHOM NO ONE OFFERS TO
REPLY
THE TWO GIRLS DEPARTED
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO PASS THROUGH THE DOOR THE FATHER
DETAINED THE ELDER BY THE ARM AND SAID TO HER WITH A PECULIAR ACCENT
YOU WILL BE HERE AT FIVE O'CLOCK PRECISELY
BOTH OF YOU
I SHALL NEED
YOU
MARIUS REDOUBLED HIS ATTENTION
ON BEING LEFT ALONE WITH HIS WIFE JONDRETTE BEGAN TO PACE THE ROOM
AGAIN AND MADE THE TOUR OF IT TWO OR THREE TIMES IN SILENCE
THEN HE
SPENT SEVERAL MINUTES IN TUCKING THE LOWER PART OF THE WOMAN'S CHEMISE
WHICH HE WORE INTO HIS TROUSERS
ALL AT ONCE HE TURNED TO THE FEMALE JONDRETTE FOLDED HIS ARMS AND
EXCLAIMED
AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TELL YOU SOMETHING THE YOUNG LADY
WELL WHAT RETORTED HIS WIFE THE YOUNG LADY
MARIUS COULD NOT DOUBT THAT IT WAS REALLY SHE OF WHOM THEY WERE
SPEAKING
HE LISTENED WITH ARDENT ANXIETY
HIS WHOLE LIFE WAS IN HIS
EARS
BUT JONDRETTE HAD BENT OVER AND SPOKE TO HIS WIFE IN A WHISPER
THEN HE
STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AND CONCLUDED ALOUD
IT IS SHE
THAT ONE SAID HIS WIFE
THAT VERY ONE SAID THE HUSBAND
NO EXPRESSION CAN REPRODUCE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MOTHER'S WORDS
SURPRISE RAGE HATE WRATH WERE MINGLED AND COMBINED IN ONE MONSTROUS
INTONATION
THE PRONUNCIATION OF A FEW WORDS THE NAME NO DOUBT WHICH
HER HUSBAND HAD WHISPERED IN HER EAR HAD SUFFICED TO ROUSE THIS HUGE
SOMNOLENT WOMAN AND FROM BEING REPULSIVE SHE BECAME TERRIBLE
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE SHE CRIED
WHEN I THINK THAT MY DAUGHTERS ARE
GOING BAREFOOT AND HAVE NOT A GOWN TO THEIR BACKS WHAT A SATIN
PELISSE A VELVET BONNET BOOTS AND EVERYTHING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED
FRANCS' WORTH OF CLOTHES SO THAT ONE WOULD THINK SHE WAS A LADY NO
YOU ARE MISTAKEN WHY IN THE FIRST PLACE THE OTHER WAS HIDEOUS AND
THIS ONE IS NOT SO BAD LOOKING SHE REALLY IS NOT BAD LOOKING IT CAN'T
BE SHE
I TELL YOU THAT IT IS SHE
YOU WILL SEE
AT THIS ABSOLUTE ASSERTION THE JONDRETTE WOMAN RAISED HER LARGE RED
BLONDE FACE AND STARED AT THE CEILING WITH A HORRIBLE EXPRESSION
AT THAT MOMENT SHE SEEMED TO MARIUS EVEN MORE TO BE FEARED THAN HER
HUSBAND
SHE WAS A SOW WITH THE LOOK OF A TIGRESS
WHAT SHE RESUMED THAT HORRIBLE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY WHO GAZED AT
MY DAUGHTERS WITH AN AIR OF PITY SHE IS THAT BEGGAR BRAT OH I SHOULD
LIKE TO KICK HER STOMACH IN FOR HER
SHE SPRANG OFF OF THE BED AND REMAINED STANDING FOR A MOMENT HER
HAIR IN DISORDER HER NOSTRILS DILATING HER MOUTH HALF OPEN HER FISTS
CLENCHED AND DRAWN BACK
THEN SHE FELL BACK ON THE BED ONCE MORE
THE
MAN PACED TO AND FRO AND PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIS FEMALE
AFTER A SILENCE LASTING SEVERAL MINUTES HE APPROACHED THE FEMALE
JONDRETTE AND HALTED IN FRONT OF HER WITH FOLDED ARMS AS HE HAD DONE
A MOMENT BEFORE
AND SHALL I TELL YOU ANOTHER THING
WHAT IS IT SHE ASKED
HE ANSWERED IN A LOW CURT VOICE
MY FORTUNE IS MADE
THE WOMAN STARED AT HIM WITH THE LOOK THAT SIGNIFIES IS THE PERSON WHO
IS ADDRESSING ME ON THE POINT OF GOING MAD
HE WENT ON
THUNDER IT WAS NOT SO VERY LONG AGO THAT I WAS A PARISHIONER OF
THE PARISH OF
DIE OF HUNGER IF YOU HAVE A FIRE DIE OF COLD IF YOU HAVE BREAD I HAVE
HAD ENOUGH OF MISERY MY SHARE AND OTHER PEOPLE'S SHARE I AM NOT JOKING
ANY LONGER I DON'T FIND IT COMIC ANY MORE I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF PUNS
GOOD GOD NO MORE FARCES ETERNAL FATHER I WANT TO EAT TILL I AM FULL
I WANT TO DRINK MY FILL TO GORMANDIZE TO SLEEP TO DO NOTHING I WANT
TO HAVE MY TURN SO I DO COME NOW BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO BE A BIT OF
A MILLIONNAIRE
HE TOOK A TURN ROUND THE HOVEL AND ADDED
LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT ASKED THE WOMAN
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WINKED SCREWED UP ONE EYE AND RAISED HIS VOICE LIKE
A MEDICAL PROFESSOR WHO IS ABOUT TO MAKE A DEMONSTRATION
WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT LISTEN
HUSH MUTTERED THE WOMAN NOT SO LOUD THESE ARE MATTERS WHICH MUST
NOT BE OVERHEARD
BAH WHO'S HERE OUR NEIGHBOR I SAW HIM GO OUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO
BESIDES HE DOESN'T LISTEN THE BIG BOOBY
AND I TELL YOU THAT I SAW HIM
GO OUT
NEVERTHELESS BY A SORT OF INSTINCT JONDRETTE LOWERED HIS VOICE
ALTHOUGH NOT SUFFICIENTLY TO PREVENT MARIUS HEARING HIS WORDS
ONE
FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH ENABLED MARIUS NOT TO LOSE A WORD OF THIS
CONVERSATION WAS THE FALLING SNOW WHICH DEADENED THE SOUND OF VEHICLES
ON THE BOULEVARD
THIS IS WHAT MARIUS HEARD
LISTEN CAREFULLY
THE CROESUS IS CAUGHT OR AS GOOD AS CAUGHT THAT'S
ALL SETTLED ALREADY
EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED
I HAVE SEEN SOME PEOPLE
HE
WILL COME HERE THIS EVENING AT SIX O'CLOCK
TO BRING SIXTY FRANCS THE
RASCAL DID YOU NOTICE HOW I PLAYED THAT GAME ON HIM MY SIXTY FRANCS
MY LANDLORD MY FOURTH OF FEBRUARY I DON'T EVEN OWE FOR ONE QUARTER
ISN'T HE A FOOL SO HE WILL COME AT SIX O'CLOCK THAT'S THE HOUR WHEN
OUR NEIGHBOR GOES TO HIS DINNER
MOTHER BOUGON IS OFF WASHING DISHES IN
THE CITY
THERE'S NOT A SOUL IN THE HOUSE
THE NEIGHBOR NEVER COMES HOME
UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
THE CHILDREN SHALL STAND ON WATCH
YOU SHALL HELP
US
HE WILL GIVE IN
AND WHAT IF HE DOES NOT GIVE IN DEMANDED HIS WIFE
JONDRETTE MADE A SINISTER GESTURE AND SAID
WE'LL FIX HIM
AND HE BURST OUT LAUGHING
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME MARIUS HAD SEEN HIM LAUGH
THE LAUGH WAS COLD
AND SWEET AND PROVOKED A SHUDDER
JONDRETTE OPENED A CUPBOARD NEAR THE FIREPLACE AND DREW FROM IT AN OLD
CAP WHICH HE PLACED ON HIS HEAD AFTER BRUSHING IT WITH HIS SLEEVE
NOW SAID HE I'M GOING OUT
I HAVE SOME MORE PEOPLE THAT I MUST SEE
GOOD ONES
YOU'LL SEE HOW WELL THE WHOLE THING WILL WORK
I SHALL BE
AWAY AS SHORT A TIME AS POSSIBLE IT'S A FINE STROKE OF BUSINESS DO YOU
LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE
AND WITH BOTH FISTS THRUST INTO THE POCKETS OF HIS TROUSERS HE STOOD
FOR A MOMENT IN THOUGHT THEN EXCLAIMED
DO YOU KNOW IT'S MIGHTY LUCKY BY THE WAY THAT HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
ME IF HE HAD RECOGNIZED ME ON HIS SIDE HE WOULD NOT HAVE COME BACK
AGAIN
HE WOULD HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH OUR FINGERS IT WAS MY BEARD THAT
SAVED US MY ROMANTIC BEARD MY PRETTY LITTLE ROMANTIC BEARD
AND AGAIN HE BROKE INTO A LAUGH
HE STEPPED TO THE WINDOW
THE SNOW WAS STILL FALLING AND STREAKING THE
GRAY OF THE SKY
WHAT BEASTLY WEATHER SAID HE
THEN LAPPING HIS OVERCOAT ACROSS HIS BREAST
THIS RIND IS TOO LARGE FOR ME
NEVER MIND HE ADDED HE DID A
DEVILISH GOOD THING IN LEAVING IT FOR ME THE OLD SCOUNDREL IF IT
HADN'T BEEN FOR THAT I COULDN'T HAVE GONE OUT AND EVERYTHING WOULD
HAVE GONE WRONG WHAT SMALL POINTS THINGS HANG ON ANYWAY
AND PULLING HIS CAP DOWN OVER HIS EYES HE QUITTED THE ROOM
HE HAD BARELY HAD TIME TO TAKE HALF A DOZEN STEPS FROM THE DOOR WHEN
THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN AND HIS SAVAGE BUT INTELLIGENT FACE MADE ITS
APPEARANCE ONCE MORE IN THE OPENING
I CAME NEAR FORGETTING SAID HE
YOU ARE TO HAVE A BRAZIER OF
CHARCOAL READY
AND HE FLUNG INTO HIS WIFE'S APRON THE FIVE FRANC PIECE WHICH THE
PHILANTHROPIST HAD LEFT WITH HIM
A BRAZIER OF CHARCOAL ASKED HIS WIFE
YES
HOW MANY BUSHELS
TWO GOOD ONES
THAT WILL COME TO THIRTY SOUS
WITH THE REST I WILL BUY SOMETHING FOR
DINNER
THE DEVIL NO
WHY
DON'T GO AND SPEND THE HUNDRED SOU PIECE
WHY
BECAUSE I SHALL HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING TOO
WHAT
SOMETHING
HOW MUCH SHALL YOU NEED
WHEREABOUTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS THERE AN IRONMONGER'S SHOP
RUE MOUFFETARD
AH YES AT THE CORNER OF A STREET I CAN SEE THE SHOP
BUT TELL ME HOW MUCH YOU WILL NEED FOR WHAT YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE
FIFTY SOUS THREE FRANCS
THERE WON'T BE MUCH LEFT FOR DINNER
EATING IS NOT THE POINT TO DAY
THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER TO BE DONE
THAT'S ENOUGH MY JEWEL
AT THIS WORD FROM HIS WIFE JONDRETTE CLOSED THE DOOR AGAIN AND THIS
TIME MARIUS HEARD HIS STEP DIE AWAY IN THE CORRIDOR OF THE HOVEL AND
DESCEND THE STAIRCASE RAPIDLY
AT THAT MOMENT ONE O'CLOCK STRUCK FROM THE CHURCH OF SAINT MEDARD
CHAPTER XIII SOLUS CUM SOLO IN LOCO REMOTO NON COGITABUNTUR ORARE
PATER NOSTER
MARIUS DREAMER AS HE WAS WAS AS WE HAVE SAID FIRM AND ENERGETIC BY
NATURE
HIS HABITS OF SOLITARY MEDITATION WHILE THEY HAD DEVELOPED IN
HIM SYMPATHY AND COMPASSION HAD PERHAPS DIMINISHED THE FACULTY FOR
IRRITATION BUT HAD LEFT INTACT THE POWER OF WAXING INDIGNANT HE HAD
THE KINDLINESS OF A BRAHMIN AND THE SEVERITY OF A JUDGE HE TOOK PITY
UPON A TOAD BUT HE CRUSHED A VIPER
NOW IT WAS INTO A HOLE OF VIPERS
THAT HIS GLANCE HAD JUST BEEN DIRECTED IT WAS A NEST OF MONSTERS THAT
HE HAD BENEATH HIS EYES
THESE WRETCHES MUST BE STAMPED UPON SAID HE
NOT ONE OF THE ENIGMAS WHICH HE HAD HOPED TO SEE SOLVED HAD BEEN
ELUCIDATED ON THE CONTRARY ALL OF THEM HAD BEEN RENDERED MORE DENSE
IF ANYTHING HE KNEW NOTHING MORE ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN OF THE
LUXEMBOURG AND THE MAN WHOM HE CALLED M
LEBLANC EXCEPT THAT JONDRETTE
WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
ATHWART THE MYSTERIOUS WORDS WHICH HAD BEEN
UTTERED THE ONLY THING OF WHICH HE CAUGHT A DISTINCT GLIMPSE WAS THE
FACT THAT AN AMBUSH WAS IN COURSE OF PREPARATION A DARK BUT TERRIBLE
TRAP THAT BOTH OF THEM WERE INCURRING GREAT DANGER SHE PROBABLY HER
FATHER CERTAINLY THAT THEY MUST BE SAVED THAT THE HIDEOUS PLOTS OF THE
JONDRETTES MUST BE THWARTED AND THE WEB OF THESE SPIDERS BROKEN
HE SCANNED THE FEMALE JONDRETTE FOR A MOMENT
SHE HAD PULLED AN OLD
SHEET IRON STOVE FROM A CORNER AND SHE WAS RUMMAGING AMONG THE OLD HEAP
OF IRON
HE DESCENDED FROM THE COMMODE AS SOFTLY AS POSSIBLE TAKING CARE NOT TO
MAKE THE LEAST NOISE
AMID HIS TERROR AS TO WHAT WAS IN PREPARATION AND
IN THE HORROR WITH WHICH THE JONDRETTES HAD INSPIRED HIM HE EXPERIENCED
A SORT OF JOY AT THE IDEA THAT IT MIGHT BE GRANTED TO HIM PERHAPS TO
RENDER A SERVICE TO THE ONE WHOM HE LOVED
BUT HOW WAS IT TO BE DONE HOW WARN THE PERSONS THREATENED HE DID NOT
KNOW THEIR ADDRESS
THEY HAD REAPPEARED FOR AN INSTANT BEFORE HIS EYES
AND HAD THEN PLUNGED BACK AGAIN INTO THE IMMENSE DEPTHS OF PARIS
SHOULD
HE WAIT FOR M
LEBLANC AT THE DOOR THAT EVENING AT SIX O'CLOCK AT THE
MOMENT OF HIS ARRIVAL AND WARN HIM OF THE TRAP BUT JONDRETTE AND HIS
MEN WOULD SEE HIM ON THE WATCH THE SPOT WAS LONELY THEY WERE STRONGER
THAN HE THEY WOULD DEVISE MEANS TO SEIZE HIM OR TO GET HIM AWAY AND
THE MAN WHOM MARIUS WAS ANXIOUS TO SAVE WOULD BE LOST
ONE O'CLOCK HAD
JUST STRUCK THE TRAP WAS TO BE SPRUNG AT SIX
MARIUS HAD FIVE HOURS
BEFORE HIM
THERE WAS BUT ONE THING TO BE DONE
HE PUT ON HIS DECENT COAT KNOTTED A SILK HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HIS NECK
TOOK HIS HAT AND WENT OUT WITHOUT MAKING ANY MORE NOISE THAN IF HE HAD
BEEN TREADING ON MOSS WITH BARE FEET
MOREOVER THE JONDRETTE WOMAN CONTINUED TO RUMMAGE AMONG HER OLD IRON
ONCE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE HE MADE FOR THE RUE DU PETIT BANQUIER
HE HAD ALMOST REACHED THE MIDDLE OF THIS STREET NEAR A VERY LOW WALL
WHICH A MAN CAN EASILY STEP OVER AT CERTAIN POINTS AND WHICH ABUTS ON
A WASTE SPACE AND WAS WALKING SLOWLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS PREOCCUPIED
CONDITION AND THE SNOW DEADENED THE SOUND OF HIS STEPS ALL AT ONCE HE
HEARD VOICES TALKING VERY CLOSE BY
HE TURNED HIS HEAD THE STREET WAS
DESERTED THERE WAS NOT A SOUL IN IT IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT AND YET HE
DISTINCTLY HEARD VOICES
IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO GLANCE OVER THE WALL WHICH HE WAS SKIRTING
THERE IN FACT SAT TWO MEN FLAT ON THE SNOW WITH THEIR BACKS AGAINST
THE WALL TALKING TOGETHER IN SUBDUED TONES
THESE TWO PERSONS WERE STRANGERS TO HIM ONE WAS A BEARDED MAN IN A
BLOUSE AND THE OTHER A LONG HAIRED INDIVIDUAL IN RAGS
THE BEARDED MAN
HAD ON A FEZ THE OTHER'S HEAD WAS BARE AND THE SNOW HAD LODGED IN HIS
HAIR
BY THRUSTING HIS HEAD OVER THE WALL MARIUS COULD HEAR THEIR REMARKS
THE HAIRY ONE JOGGED THE OTHER MAN'S ELBOW AND SAID
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF PATRON MINETTE IT CAN'T FAIL
DO YOU THINK SO SAID THE BEARDED MAN
AND THE LONG HAIRED ONE BEGAN AGAIN
IT'S AS GOOD AS A WARRANT FOR EACH ONE OF FIVE HUNDRED BALLS AND THE
WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN IS FIVE YEARS SIX YEARS TEN YEARS AT THE MOST
THE OTHER REPLIED WITH SOME HESITATION AND SHIVERING BENEATH HIS FEZ
THAT'S A REAL THING
YOU CAN'T GO AGAINST SUCH THINGS
I TELL YOU THAT THE AFFAIR CAN'T GO WRONG RESUMED THE LONG HAIRED
MAN
FATHER WHAT'S HIS NAME'S TEAM WILL BE ALREADY HARNESSED
THEN THEY BEGAN TO DISCUSS A MELODRAMA THAT THEY HAD SEEN ON THE
PRECEDING EVENING AT THE GAITE THEATRE
MARIUS WENT HIS WAY
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE MYSTERIOUS WORDS OF THESE MEN SO STRANGELY
HIDDEN BEHIND THAT WALL AND CROUCHING IN THE SNOW COULD NOT BUT BEAR
SOME RELATION TO JONDRETTE'S ABOMINABLE PROJECTS
THAT MUST BE THE
AFFAIR
HE DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARDS THE FAUBOURG SAINT MARCEAU AND ASKED AT
THE FIRST SHOP HE CAME TO WHERE HE COULD FIND A COMMISSARY OF POLICE
HE WAS DIRECTED TO RUE DE PONTOISE NO
14
THITHER MARIUS BETOOK HIMSELF
AS HE PASSED A BAKER'S SHOP HE BOUGHT A TWO PENNY ROLL AND ATE IT
FORESEEING THAT HE SHOULD NOT DINE
ON THE WAY HE RENDERED JUSTICE TO PROVIDENCE
HE REFLECTED THAT HAD HE
NOT GIVEN HIS FIVE FRANCS TO THE JONDRETTE GIRL IN THE MORNING HE
WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED M
LEBLANC'S FIACRE AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE REMAINED
IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING AND THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO OBSTACLE TO
THE TRAP OF THE JONDRETTES AND THAT M
LEBLANC WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST AND
HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM NO DOUBT
CHAPTER XIV IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYER
ON ARRIVING AT NO
14 RUE DE PONTOISE HE ASCENDED TO THE FIRST FLOOR
AND INQUIRED FOR THE COMMISSARY OF POLICE
THE COMMISSARY OF POLICE IS NOT HERE SAID A CLERK BUT THERE IS AN
INSPECTOR WHO TAKES HIS PLACE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK TO HIM ARE YOU
IN HASTE
YES SAID MARIUS
THE CLERK INTRODUCED HIM INTO THE COMMISSARY'S OFFICE
THERE STOOD A
TALL MAN BEHIND A GRATING LEANING AGAINST A STOVE AND HOLDING UP WITH
BOTH HANDS THE TAILS OF A VAST TOPCOAT WITH THREE COLLARS
HIS FACE
WAS SQUARE WITH A THIN FIRM MOUTH THICK GRAY AND VERY FEROCIOUS
WHISKERS AND A LOOK THAT WAS ENOUGH TO TURN YOUR POCKETS INSIDE OUT
OF THAT GLANCE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WELL SAID NOT THAT IT PENETRATED BUT
THAT IT SEARCHED
THIS MAN'S AIR WAS NOT MUCH LESS FEROCIOUS NOR LESS TERRIBLE THAN
JONDRETTE'S THE DOG IS AT TIMES NO LESS TERRIBLE TO MEET THAN THE
WOLF
WHAT DO YOU WANT HE SAID TO MARIUS WITHOUT ADDING MONSIEUR
IS THIS MONSIEUR LE COMMISSAIRE DE POLICE
HE IS ABSENT
I AM HERE IN HIS STEAD
THE MATTER IS VERY PRIVATE
THEN SPEAK
AND GREAT HASTE IS REQUIRED
THEN SPEAK QUICK
THIS CALM ABRUPT MAN WAS BOTH TERRIFYING AND REASSURING AT ONE AND THE
SAME TIME
HE INSPIRED FEAR AND CONFIDENCE
MARIUS RELATED THE ADVENTURE
TO HIM THAT A PERSON WITH WHOM HE WAS NOT ACQUAINTED OTHERWISE THAN BY
SIGHT WAS TO BE INVEIGLED INTO A TRAP THAT VERY EVENING THAT AS HE
OCCUPIED THE ROOM ADJOINING THE DEN HE MARIUS PONTMERCY A LAWYER
HAD HEARD THE WHOLE PLOT THROUGH THE PARTITION THAT THE WRETCH WHO
HAD PLANNED THE TRAP WAS A CERTAIN JONDRETTE THAT THERE WOULD BE
ACCOMPLICES PROBABLY SOME PROWLERS OF THE BARRIERS AMONG OTHERS A
CERTAIN PANCHAUD ALIAS PRINTANIER ALIAS BIGRENAILLE THAT JONDRETTE'S
DAUGHTERS WERE TO LIE IN WAIT THAT THERE WAS NO WAY OF WARNING THE
THREATENED MAN SINCE HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW HIS NAME AND THAT FINALLY
ALL THIS WAS TO BE CARRIED OUT AT SIX O'CLOCK THAT EVENING AT THE MOST
DESERTED POINT OF THE BOULEVARD DE L'HOPITAL IN HOUSE NO
50 52
AT THE SOUND OF THIS NUMBER THE INSPECTOR RAISED HIS HEAD AND SAID
COLDLY
SO IT IS IN THE ROOM AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR
PRECISELY ANSWERED MARIUS AND HE ADDED ARE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH
THAT HOUSE
THE INSPECTOR REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT THEN REPLIED AS HE WARMED
THE HEEL OF HIS BOOT AT THE DOOR OF THE STOVE
APPARENTLY
HE WENT ON MUTTERING BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND NOT ADDRESSING MARIUS SO
MUCH AS HIS CRAVAT
PATRON MINETTE MUST HAVE HAD A HAND IN THIS
THIS WORD STRUCK MARIUS
PATRON MINETTE SAID HE I DID HEAR THAT WORD PRONOUNCED IN FACT
AND HE REPEATED TO THE INSPECTOR THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE LONG HAIRED
MAN AND THE BEARDED MAN IN THE SNOW BEHIND THE WALL OF THE RUE DU
PETIT BANQUIER
THE INSPECTOR MUTTERED
THE LONG HAIRED MAN MUST BE BRUJON AND THE BEARDED ONE DEMI LIARD
ALIAS DEUX MILLIARDS
HE HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AGAIN AND BECAME ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
AS FOR FATHER WHAT'S HIS NAME I THINK I RECOGNIZE HIM
HERE I'VE
BURNED MY COAT
THEY ALWAYS HAVE TOO MUCH FIRE IN THESE CURSED STOVES
NUMBER 50 52
FORMER PROPERTY OF GORBEAU
THEN HE GLANCED AT MARIUS
YOU SAW ONLY THAT BEARDED AND THAT LONG HAIRED MAN
AND PANCHAUD
YOU DIDN'T SEE A LITTLE IMP OF A DANDY PROWLING ABOUT THE PREMISES
NO
NOR A BIG LUMP OF MATTER RESEMBLING AN ELEPHANT IN THE JARDIN DES
PLANTES
NO
NOR A SCAMP WITH THE AIR OF AN OLD RED TAIL
NO
AS FOR THE FOURTH NO ONE SEES HIM NOT EVEN HIS ADJUTANTS CLERKS AND
EMPLOYEES
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT YOU DID NOT SEE HIM
NO
WHO ARE ALL THOSE PERSONS ASKED MARIUS
THE INSPECTOR ANSWERED
BESIDES THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR THEM
HE RELAPSED INTO SILENCE THEN RESUMED
50 52
I KNOW THAT BARRACK
IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEAL OURSELVES INSIDE
IT WITHOUT THE ARTISTS SEEING US AND THEN THEY WILL GET OFF SIMPLY
BY COUNTERMANDING THE VAUDEVILLE
THEY ARE SO MODEST AN AUDIENCE
EMBARRASSES THEM
NONE OF THAT NONE OF THAT
I WANT TO HEAR THEM SING
AND MAKE THEM DANCE
THIS MONOLOGUE CONCLUDED HE TURNED TO MARIUS AND DEMANDED GAZING AT
HIM INTENTLY THE WHILE
ARE YOU AFRAID
OF WHAT SAID MARIUS
OF THESE MEN
NO MORE THAN YOURSELF RETORTED MARIUS RUDELY WHO HAD BEGUN TO NOTICE
THAT THIS POLICE AGENT HAD NOT YET SAID MONSIEUR TO HIM
THE INSPECTOR STARED STILL MORE INTENTLY AT MARIUS AND CONTINUED WITH
SENTENTIOUS SOLEMNITY
THERE YOU SPEAK LIKE A BRAVE MAN AND LIKE AN HONEST MAN
COURAGE DOES
NOT FEAR CRIME AND HONESTY DOES NOT FEAR AUTHORITY
MARIUS INTERRUPTED HIM
THAT IS WELL BUT WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO
THE INSPECTOR CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH THE REMARK
THE LODGERS HAVE PASS KEYS WITH WHICH TO GET IN AT NIGHT
YOU MUST HAVE
ONE
YES SAID MARIUS
HAVE YOU IT ABOUT YOU
YES
GIVE IT TO ME SAID THE INSPECTOR
MARIUS TOOK HIS KEY FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET HANDED IT TO THE
INSPECTOR AND ADDED
IF YOU WILL TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL COME IN FORCE
THE INSPECTOR CAST ON MARIUS SUCH A GLANCE AS VOLTAIRE MIGHT HAVE
BESTOWED ON A PROVINCIAL ACADEMICIAN WHO HAD SUGGESTED A RHYME TO HIM
WITH ONE MOVEMENT HE PLUNGED HIS HANDS WHICH WERE ENORMOUS INTO THE
TWO IMMENSE POCKETS OF HIS TOP COAT AND PULLED OUT TWO SMALL STEEL
PISTOLS OF THE SORT CALLED KNOCK ME DOWNS THEN HE PRESENTED THEM TO
MARIUS SAYING RAPIDLY IN A CURT TONE
TAKE THESE
GO HOME
HIDE IN YOUR CHAMBER SO THAT YOU MAY BE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE GONE OUT
THEY ARE LOADED
EACH ONE CARRIES TWO BALLS
YOU WILL
KEEP WATCH THERE IS A HOLE IN THE WALL AS YOU HAVE INFORMED ME
THESE
MEN WILL COME
LEAVE THEM TO THEIR OWN DEVICES FOR A TIME
WHEN YOU
THINK MATTERS HAVE REACHED A CRISIS AND THAT IT IS TIME TO PUT A STOP
TO THEM FIRE A SHOT
NOT TOO SOON
THE REST CONCERNS ME
A SHOT INTO
THE CEILING THE AIR NO MATTER WHERE
ABOVE ALL THINGS NOT TOO SOON
WAIT UNTIL THEY BEGIN TO PUT THEIR PROJECT INTO EXECUTION YOU ARE A
LAWYER YOU KNOW THE PROPER POINT MARIUS TOOK THE PISTOLS AND PUT THEM
IN THE SIDE POCKET OF HIS COAT
THAT MAKES A LUMP THAT CAN BE SEEN SAID THE INSPECTOR
PUT THEM IN
YOUR TROUSERS POCKET
MARIUS HID THE PISTOLS IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS
NOW PURSUED THE INSPECTOR THERE IS NOT A MINUTE MORE TO BE LOST BY
ANY ONE
WHAT TIME IS IT HALF PAST TWO
SEVEN O'CLOCK IS THE HOUR
SIX O'CLOCK ANSWERED MARIUS
I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME SAID THE INSPECTOR BUT NO MORE THAN ENOUGH
DON'T FORGET ANYTHING THAT I HAVE SAID TO YOU
BANG
A PISTOL SHOT
REST EASY SAID MARIUS
AND AS MARIUS LAID HIS HAND ON THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR ON HIS WAY OUT
THE INSPECTOR CALLED TO HIM
BY THE WAY IF YOU HAVE OCCASION FOR MY SERVICES BETWEEN NOW AND THEN
COME OR SEND HERE
YOU WILL ASK FOR INSPECTOR JAVERT
CHAPTER XV JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES
A FEW MOMENTS LATER ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK COURFEYRAC CHANCED TO BE
PASSING ALONG THE RUE MOUFFETARD IN COMPANY WITH BOSSUET
THE SNOW HAD
REDOUBLED IN VIOLENCE AND FILLED THE AIR
BOSSUET WAS JUST SAYING TO
COURFEYRAC
ONE WOULD SAY TO SEE ALL THESE SNOW FLAKES FALL THAT THERE WAS A
PLAGUE OF WHITE BUTTERFLIES IN HEAVEN ALL AT ONCE BOSSUET CAUGHT
SIGHT OF MARIUS COMING UP THE STREET TOWARDS THE BARRIER WITH A PECULIAR
AIR
HOLD SAID BOSSUET
THERE'S MARIUS
I SAW HIM SAID COURFEYRAC
DON'T LET'S SPEAK TO HIM
WHY
HE IS BUSY
WITH WHAT
DON'T YOU SEE HIS AIR
WHAT AIR
HE HAS THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS FOLLOWING SOME ONE
THAT'S TRUE SAID BOSSUET
JUST SEE THE EYES HE IS MAKING SAID COURFEYRAC
BUT WHO THE DEUCE IS HE FOLLOWING
SOME FINE FLOWERY BONNETED WENCH HE'S IN LOVE
BUT OBSERVED BOSSUET I DON'T SEE ANY WENCH NOR ANY FLOWERY BONNET
IN THE STREET
THERE'S NOT A WOMAN ROUND
COURFEYRAC TOOK A SURVEY AND EXCLAIMED
HE'S FOLLOWING A MAN
A MAN IN FACT WEARING A GRAY CAP AND WHOSE GRAY BEARD COULD BE
DISTINGUISHED ALTHOUGH THEY ONLY SAW HIS BACK WAS WALKING ALONG ABOUT
TWENTY PACES IN ADVANCE OF MARIUS
THIS MAN WAS DRESSED IN A GREAT COAT WHICH WAS PERFECTLY NEW AND TOO
LARGE FOR HIM AND IN A FRIGHTFUL PAIR OF TROUSERS ALL HANGING IN RAGS
AND BLACK WITH MUD
BOSSUET BURST OUT LAUGHING
WHO IS THAT MAN
HE RETORTED COURFEYRAC HE'S A POET
POETS ARE VERY FOND OF WEARING
THE TROUSERS OF DEALERS IN RABBIT SKINS AND THE OVERCOATS OF PEERS OF
FRANCE
LET'S SEE WHERE MARIUS WILL GO SAID BOSSUET LET'S SEE WHERE THE MAN
IS GOING LET'S FOLLOW THEM HEY
BOSSUET EXCLAIMED COURFEYRAC EAGLE OF MEAUX YOU ARE A PRODIGIOUS
BRUTE
FOLLOW A MAN WHO IS FOLLOWING ANOTHER MAN INDEED
THEY RETRACED THEIR STEPS
MARIUS HAD IN FACT SEEN JONDRETTE PASSING ALONG THE RUE MOUFFETARD
AND WAS SPYING ON HIS PROCEEDINGS
JONDRETTE WALKED STRAIGHT AHEAD WITHOUT A SUSPICION THAT HE WAS ALREADY
HELD BY A GLANCE
HE QUITTED THE RUE MOUFFETARD AND MARIUS SAW HIM ENTER ONE OF THE MOST
TERRIBLE HOVELS IN THE RUE GRACIEUSE HE REMAINED THERE ABOUT A QUARTER
OF AN HOUR THEN RETURNED TO THE RUE MOUFFETARD
HE HALTED AT
AN IRONMONGER'S SHOP WHICH THEN STOOD AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE
PIERRE LOMBARD AND A FEW MINUTES LATER MARIUS SAW HIM EMERGE FROM THE
SHOP HOLDING IN HIS HAND A HUGE COLD CHISEL WITH A WHITE WOOD HANDLE
WHICH HE CONCEALED BENEATH HIS GREAT COAT
AT THE TOP OF THE RUE
PETIT GENTILLY HE TURNED TO THE LEFT AND PROCEEDED RAPIDLY TO THE RUE DU
PETIT BANQUIER
THE DAY WAS DECLINING THE SNOW WHICH HAD CEASED FOR A
MOMENT HAD JUST BEGUN AGAIN
MARIUS POSTED HIMSELF ON THE WATCH AT THE
VERY CORNER OF THE RUE DU PETIT BANQUIER WHICH WAS DESERTED AS USUAL
AND DID NOT FOLLOW JONDRETTE INTO IT
IT WAS LUCKY THAT HE DID SO
FOR ON ARRIVING IN THE VICINITY OF THE WALL WHERE MARIUS HAD HEARD THE
LONG HAIRED MAN AND THE BEARDED MAN CONVERSING JONDRETTE TURNED ROUND
MADE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS FOLLOWING HIM DID NOT SEE HIM THEN SPRANG
ACROSS THE WALL AND DISAPPEARED
THE WASTE LAND BORDERED BY THIS WALL COMMUNICATED WITH THE BACK YARD OF
AN EX LIVERY STABLE KEEPER OF BAD REPUTE WHO HAD FAILED AND WHO STILL
KEPT A FEW OLD SINGLE SEATED BERLINS UNDER HIS SHEDS
MARIUS THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WISE TO PROFIT BY JONDRETTE'S ABSENCE TO
RETURN HOME MOREOVER IT WAS GROWING LATE EVERY EVENING MA'AM BOUGON
WHEN SHE SET OUT FOR HER DISH WASHING IN TOWN HAD A HABIT OF LOCKING
THE DOOR WHICH WAS ALWAYS CLOSED AT DUSK
MARIUS HAD GIVEN HIS KEY TO
THE INSPECTOR OF POLICE IT WAS IMPORTANT THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD
MAKE HASTE
EVENING HAD ARRIVED NIGHT HAD ALMOST CLOSED IN ON THE HORIZON AND IN
THE IMMENSITY OF SPACE THERE REMAINED BUT ONE SPOT ILLUMINATED BY THE
SUN AND THAT WAS THE MOON
IT WAS RISING IN A RUDDY GLOW BEHIND THE LOW DOME OF SALPETRIERE
MARIUS RETURNED TO NO
50 52 WITH GREAT STRIDES
THE DOOR WAS STILL OPEN
WHEN HE ARRIVED
HE MOUNTED THE STAIRS ON TIP TOE AND GLIDED ALONG THE
WALL OF THE CORRIDOR TO HIS CHAMBER
THIS CORRIDOR AS THE READER WILL
REMEMBER WAS BORDERED ON BOTH SIDES BY ATTICS ALL OF WHICH WERE FOR
THE MOMENT EMPTY AND TO LET
MA'AM BOUGON WAS IN THE HABIT OF LEAVING
ALL THE DOORS OPEN
AS HE PASSED ONE OF THESE ATTICS MARIUS THOUGHT
HE PERCEIVED IN THE UNINHABITED CELL THE MOTIONLESS HEADS OF FOUR MEN
VAGUELY LIGHTED UP BY A REMNANT OF DAYLIGHT FALLING THROUGH A DORMER
WINDOW
MARIUS MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE NOT WISHING TO BE SEEN HIMSELF
HE
SUCCEEDED IN REACHING HIS CHAMBER WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND WITHOUT MAKING
ANY NOISE
IT WAS HIGH TIME
A MOMENT LATER HE HEARD MA'AM BOUGON TAKE
HER DEPARTURE LOCKING THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE BEHIND HER
CHAPTER XVI IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH AIR WHICH
WAS IN FASHION IN 1832
MARIUS SEATED HIMSELF ON HIS BED
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF PAST FIVE
O'CLOCK
ONLY HALF AN HOUR SEPARATED HIM FROM WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN
HE HEARD THE BEATING OF HIS ARTERIES AS ONE HEARS THE TICKING OF A WATCH
IN THE DARK
HE THOUGHT OF THE DOUBLE MARCH WHICH WAS GOING ON AT THAT
MOMENT IN THE DARK CRIME ADVANCING ON ONE SIDE JUSTICE COMING UP ON
THE OTHER
HE WAS NOT AFRAID BUT HE COULD NOT THINK WITHOUT A SHUDDER
OF WHAT WAS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE
AS IS THE CASE WITH ALL THOSE WHO ARE
SUDDENLY ASSAILED BY AN UNFORESEEN ADVENTURE THE ENTIRE DAY PRODUCED
UPON HIM THE EFFECT OF A DREAM AND IN ORDER TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE
WAS NOT THE PREY OF A NIGHTMARE HE HAD TO FEEL THE COLD BARRELS OF THE
STEEL PISTOLS IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS
IT WAS NO LONGER SNOWING THE MOON DISENGAGED ITSELF MORE AND MORE
CLEARLY FROM THE MIST AND ITS LIGHT MINGLED WITH THE WHITE REFLECTION
OF THE SNOW WHICH HAD FALLEN COMMUNICATED TO THE CHAMBER A SORT OF
TWILIGHT ASPECT
THERE WAS A LIGHT IN THE JONDRETTE DEN
MARIUS SAW THE HOLE IN THE WALL
SHINING WITH A REDDISH GLOW WHICH SEEMED BLOODY TO HIM
IT WAS TRUE THAT THE LIGHT COULD NOT BE PRODUCED BY A CANDLE
HOWEVER
THERE WAS NOT A SOUND IN THE JONDRETTE QUARTERS NOT A SOUL WAS MOVING
THERE NOT A SOUL SPEAKING NOT A BREATH THE SILENCE WAS GLACIAL AND
PROFOUND AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT LIGHT HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT
HIMSELF NEXT DOOR TO A SEPULCHRE
MARIUS SOFTLY REMOVED HIS BOOTS AND PUSHED THEM UNDER HIS BED
SEVERAL MINUTES ELAPSED
MARIUS HEARD THE LOWER DOOR TURN ON ITS HINGES
A HEAVY STEP MOUNTED THE STAIRCASE AND HASTENED ALONG THE CORRIDOR THE
LATCH OF THE HOVEL WAS NOISILY LIFTED IT WAS JONDRETTE RETURNING
INSTANTLY SEVERAL VOICES AROSE
THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS IN THE GARRET
ONLY IT HAD BEEN SILENT IN THE MASTER'S ABSENCE LIKE WOLF WHELPS IN
THE ABSENCE OF THE WOLF
IT'S I SAID HE
GOOD EVENING DADDY YELPED THE GIRLS
WELL SAID THE MOTHER
ALL'S GOING FIRST RATE RESPONDED JONDRETTE BUT MY FEET ARE BEASTLY
COLD
GOOD YOU HAVE DRESSED UP
YOU HAVE DONE WELL YOU MUST INSPIRE
CONFIDENCE
ALL READY TO GO OUT
DON'T FORGET WHAT I TOLD YOU
YOU WILL DO EVERYTHING SURE
REST EASY
BECAUSE SAID JONDRETTE
AND HE LEFT THE PHRASE UNFINISHED
MARIUS HEARD HIM LAY SOMETHING HEAVY ON THE TABLE PROBABLY THE CHISEL
WHICH HE HAD PURCHASED
BY THE WAY SAID JONDRETTE HAVE YOU BEEN EATING HERE
YES SAID THE MOTHER
I GOT THREE LARGE POTATOES AND SOME SALT
I
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE FIRE TO COOK THEM
GOOD RETURNED JONDRETTE
TO MORROW I WILL TAKE YOU OUT TO DINE WITH
ME
WE WILL HAVE A DUCK AND FIXINGS
YOU SHALL DINE LIKE CHARLES THE
TENTH ALL IS GOING WELL
THEN HE ADDED
THE MOUSE TRAP IS OPEN
THE CATS ARE THERE
HE LOWERED HIS VOICE STILL FURTHER AND SAID
PUT THIS IN THE FIRE
MARIUS HEARD A SOUND OF CHARCOAL BEING KNOCKED WITH THE TONGS OR SOME
IRON UTENSIL AND JONDRETTE CONTINUED
HAVE YOU GREASED THE HINGES OF THE DOOR SO THAT THEY WILL NOT SQUEAK
YES REPLIED THE MOTHER
WHAT TIME IS IT
NEARLY SIX
THE HALF HOUR STRUCK FROM SAINT MEDARD A WHILE AGO
THE DEVIL EJACULATED JONDRETTE THE CHILDREN MUST GO AND WATCH
COME
YOU DO YOU LISTEN HERE
A WHISPERING ENSUED
JONDRETTE'S VOICE BECAME AUDIBLE AGAIN
HAS OLD BOUGON LEFT
YES SAID THE MOTHER
ARE YOU SURE THAT THERE IS NO ONE IN OUR NEIGHBOR'S ROOM
HE HAS NOT BEEN IN ALL DAY AND YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT THIS IS HIS
DINNER HOUR
YOU ARE SURE
SURE
ALL THE SAME SAID JONDRETTE THERE'S NO HARM IN GOING TO SEE WHETHER
HE IS THERE
HERE MY GIRL TAKE THE CANDLE AND GO THERE
MARIUS FELL ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND CRAWLED SILENTLY UNDER HIS BED
HARDLY HAD HE CONCEALED HIMSELF WHEN HE PERCEIVED A LIGHT THROUGH THE
CRACK OF HIS DOOR
P'PA CRIED A VOICE HE IS NOT IN HERE
HE RECOGNIZED THE VOICE OF THE ELDEST DAUGHTER
DID YOU GO IN DEMANDED HER FATHER
NO REPLIED THE GIRL BUT AS HIS KEY IS IN THE DOOR HE MUST BE OUT
THE FATHER EXCLAIMED
GO IN NEVERTHELESS
THE DOOR OPENED AND MARIUS SAW THE TALL JONDRETTE COME IN WITH A CANDLE
IN HER HAND
SHE WAS AS SHE HAD BEEN IN THE MORNING ONLY STILL MORE
REPULSIVE IN THIS LIGHT
SHE WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE BED
MARIUS ENDURED AN INDESCRIBABLE
MOMENT OF ANXIETY BUT NEAR THE BED THERE WAS A MIRROR NAILED TO THE
WALL AND IT WAS THITHER THAT SHE WAS DIRECTING HER STEPS
SHE RAISED
HERSELF ON TIPTOE AND LOOKED AT HERSELF IN IT
IN THE NEIGHBORING ROOM
THE SOUND OF IRON ARTICLES BEING MOVED WAS AUDIBLE
SHE SMOOTHED HER HAIR WITH THE PALM OF HER HAND AND SMILED INTO THE
MIRROR HUMMING WITH HER CRACKED AND SEPULCHRAL VOICE
NOS AMOURS ONT DURE TOUTE UNE SEMAINE 28
MAIS QUE DU BONHEUR LES INSTANTS SONT COURTS
S'ADORER HUIT JOURS C' ETAIT BIEN LA PEINE
LE TEMPS DES AMOURS DEVAIT DURER TOUJOURS
DEVRAIT DURER TOUJOURS DEVRAIT DURER TOUJOURS
IN THE MEANTIME MARIUS TREMBLED
IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM THAT SHE
SHOULD NOT HEAR HIS BREATHING
SHE STEPPED TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT WITH THE HALF FOOLISH WAY SHE
HAD
HOW UGLY PARIS IS WHEN IT HAS PUT ON A WHITE CHEMISE SAID SHE
SHE RETURNED TO THE MIRROR AND BEGAN AGAIN TO PUT ON AIRS BEFORE IT
SCRUTINIZING HERSELF FULL FACE AND THREE QUARTERS FACE IN TURN
WELL CRIED HER FATHER WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT THERE
I AM LOOKING UNDER THE BED AND THE FURNITURE SHE REPLIED CONTINUING
TO ARRANGE HER HAIR THERE'S NO ONE HERE
BOOBY YELLED HER FATHER
COME HERE THIS MINUTE AND DON'T WASTE ANY
TIME ABOUT IT
COMING COMING SAID SHE
ONE HAS NO TIME FOR ANYTHING IN THIS
HOVEL
SHE HUMMED
VOUS ME QUITTEZ POUR ALLER A LA GLOIRE 29
MON TRISTE COEUR SUIVRA PARTOUT
SHE CAST A PARTING GLANCE IN THE MIRROR AND WENT OUT SHUTTING THE DOOR
BEHIND HER
A MOMENT MORE AND MARIUS HEARD THE SOUND OF THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS' BARE
FEET IN THE CORRIDOR AND JONDRETTE'S VOICE SHOUTING TO THEM
PAY STRICT HEED ONE ON THE SIDE OF THE BARRIER THE OTHER AT THE
CORNER OF THE RUE DU PETIT BANQUIER
DON'T LOSE SIGHT FOR A MOMENT OF
THE DOOR OF THIS HOUSE AND THE MOMENT YOU SEE ANYTHING RUSH HERE ON
THE INSTANT AS HARD AS YOU CAN GO YOU HAVE A KEY TO GET IN
THE ELDEST GIRL GRUMBLED
THE IDEA OF STANDING WATCH IN THE SNOW BAREFOOT
TO MORROW YOU SHALL HAVE SOME DAINTY LITTLE GREEN SILK BOOTS SAID THE
FATHER
THEY RAN DOWN STAIRS AND A FEW SECONDS LATER THE SHOCK OF THE OUTER
DOOR AS IT BANGED TO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE OUTSIDE
THERE NOW REMAINED IN THE HOUSE ONLY MARIUS THE JONDRETTES AND
PROBABLY ALSO THE MYSTERIOUS PERSONS OF WHOM MARIUS HAD CAUGHT A
GLIMPSE IN THE TWILIGHT BEHIND THE DOOR OF THE UNUSED ATTIC
CHAPTER XVII THE USE MADE OF MARIUS' FIVE FRANC PIECE
MARIUS DECIDED THAT THE MOMENT HAD NOW ARRIVED WHEN HE MUST RESUME HIS
POST AT HIS OBSERVATORY
IN A TWINKLING AND WITH THE AGILITY OF HIS
AGE HE HAD REACHED THE HOLE IN THE PARTITION
HE LOOKED
THE INTERIOR OF THE JONDRETTE APARTMENT PRESENTED A CURIOUS ASPECT AND
MARIUS FOUND AN EXPLANATION OF THE SINGULAR LIGHT WHICH HE HAD NOTICED
A CANDLE WAS BURNING IN A CANDLESTICK COVERED WITH VERDIGRIS BUT
THAT WAS NOT WHAT REALLY LIGHTED THE CHAMBER
THE HOVEL WAS COMPLETELY
ILLUMINATED AS IT WERE BY THE REFLECTION FROM A RATHER LARGE
SHEET IRON BRAZIER STANDING IN THE FIREPLACE AND FILLED WITH BURNING
CHARCOAL THE BRAZIER PREPARED BY THE JONDRETTE WOMAN THAT MORNING
THE
CHARCOAL WAS GLOWING HOT AND THE BRAZIER WAS RED A BLUE FLAME FLICKERED
OVER IT AND HELPED HIM TO MAKE OUT THE FORM OF THE CHISEL PURCHASED BY
JONDRETTE IN THE RUE PIERRE LOMBARD WHERE IT HAD BEEN THRUST INTO THE
BRAZIER TO HEAT
IN ONE CORNER NEAR THE DOOR AND AS THOUGH PREPARED
FOR SOME DEFINITE USE TWO HEAPS WERE VISIBLE WHICH APPEARED TO BE THE
ONE A HEAP OF OLD IRON THE OTHER A HEAP OF ROPES
ALL THIS WOULD HAVE
CAUSED THE MIND OF A PERSON WHO KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS IN PREPARATION
TO WAVER BETWEEN A VERY SINISTER AND A VERY SIMPLE IDEA
THE LAIR THUS
LIGHTED UP MORE RESEMBLED A FORGE THAN A MOUTH OF HELL BUT JONDRETTE
IN THIS LIGHT HAD RATHER THE AIR OF A DEMON THAN OF A SMITH
THE HEAT OF THE BRAZIER WAS SO GREAT THAT THE CANDLE ON THE TABLE WAS
MELTING ON THE SIDE NEXT THE CHAFING DISH AND WAS DROOPING OVER
AN OLD
DARK LANTERN OF COPPER WORTHY OF DIOGENES TURNED CARTOUCHE STOOD ON
THE CHIMNEY PIECE
THE BRAZIER PLACED IN THE FIREPLACE ITSELF BESIDE THE NEARLY EXTINCT
BRANDS SENT ITS VAPORS UP THE CHIMNEY AND GAVE OUT NO ODOR
THE MOON ENTERING THROUGH THE FOUR PANES OF THE WINDOW CAST ITS
WHITENESS INTO THE CRIMSON AND FLAMING GARRET AND TO THE POETIC SPIRIT
OF MARIUS WHO WAS DREAMY EVEN IN THE MOMENT OF ACTION IT WAS LIKE A
THOUGHT OF HEAVEN MINGLED WITH THE MISSHAPEN REVERIES OF EARTH
A BREATH OF AIR WHICH MADE ITS WAY IN THROUGH THE OPEN PANE HELPED TO
DISSIPATE THE SMELL OF THE CHARCOAL AND TO CONCEAL THE PRESENCE OF THE
BRAZIER
THE JONDRETTE LAIR WAS IF THE READER RECALLS WHAT WE HAVE SAID OF THE
GORBEAU BUILDING ADMIRABLY CHOSEN TO SERVE AS THE THEATRE OF A VIOLENT
AND SOMBRE DEED AND AS THE ENVELOPE FOR A CRIME
IT WAS THE MOST
RETIRED CHAMBER IN THE MOST ISOLATED HOUSE ON THE MOST DESERTED
BOULEVARD IN PARIS
IF THE SYSTEM OF AMBUSH AND TRAPS HAD NOT ALREADY
EXISTED THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN INVENTED THERE
THE WHOLE THICKNESS OF A HOUSE AND A MULTITUDE OF UNINHABITED ROOMS
SEPARATED THIS DEN FROM THE BOULEVARD AND THE ONLY WINDOW THAT EXISTED
OPENED ON WASTE LANDS ENCLOSED WITH WALLS AND PALISADES
JONDRETTE HAD LIGHTED HIS PIPE SEATED HIMSELF ON THE SEATLESS CHAIR
AND WAS ENGAGED IN SMOKING
HIS WIFE WAS TALKING TO HIM IN A LOW TONE
IF MARIUS HAD BEEN COURFEYRAC THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO
LAUGH ON EVERY OCCASION IN LIFE HE WOULD HAVE BURST WITH LAUGHTER WHEN
HIS GAZE FELL ON THE JONDRETTE WOMAN
SHE HAD ON A BLACK BONNET WITH
PLUMES NOT UNLIKE THE HATS OF THE HERALDS AT ARMS AT THE CORONATION OF
CHARLES X AN IMMENSE TARTAN SHAWL OVER HER KNITTED PETTICOAT AND THE
MAN'S SHOES WHICH HER DAUGHTER HAD SCORNED IN THE MORNING
IT WAS THIS
TOILETTE WHICH HAD EXTRACTED FROM JONDRETTE THE EXCLAMATION GOOD YOU
HAVE DRESSED UP
YOU HAVE DONE WELL
YOU MUST INSPIRE CONFIDENCE
AS FOR JONDRETTE HE HAD NOT TAKEN OFF THE NEW SURTOUT WHICH WAS TOO
LARGE FOR HIM AND WHICH M
LEBLANC HAD GIVEN HIM AND HIS COSTUME
CONTINUED TO PRESENT THAT CONTRAST OF COAT AND TROUSERS WHICH
CONSTITUTED THE IDEAL OF A POET IN COURFEYRAC'S EYES
ALL AT ONCE JONDRETTE LIFTED UP HIS VOICE
BY THE WAY NOW THAT I THINK OF IT
IN THIS WEATHER HE WILL COME IN A
CARRIAGE
LIGHT THE LANTERN TAKE IT AND GO DOWN STAIRS
YOU WILL STAND
BEHIND THE LOWER DOOR
THE VERY MOMENT THAT YOU HEAR THE CARRIAGE STOP
YOU WILL OPEN THE DOOR INSTANTLY HE WILL COME UP YOU WILL LIGHT THE
STAIRCASE AND THE CORRIDOR AND WHEN HE ENTERS HERE YOU WILL GO DOWN
STAIRS AGAIN AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE YOU WILL PAY THE COACHMAN AND
DISMISS THE FIACRE
AND THE MONEY INQUIRED THE WOMAN
JONDRETTE FUMBLED IN HIS TROUSERS POCKET AND HANDED HER FIVE FRANCS
WHAT'S THIS SHE EXCLAIMED
JONDRETTE REPLIED WITH DIGNITY
THAT IS THE MONARCH WHICH OUR NEIGHBOR GAVE US THIS MORNING
AND HE ADDED
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TWO CHAIRS WILL BE NEEDED HERE
WHAT FOR
TO SIT ON
MARIUS FELT A COLD CHILL PASS THROUGH HIS LIMBS AT HEARING THIS MILD
ANSWER FROM JONDRETTE
PARDIEU I'LL GO AND GET ONE OF OUR NEIGHBOR'S
AND WITH A RAPID MOVEMENT SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE DEN AND WENT OUT
INTO THE CORRIDOR
MARIUS ABSOLUTELY HAD NOT THE TIME TO DESCEND FROM THE COMMODE REACH
HIS BED AND CONCEAL HIMSELF BENEATH IT
TAKE THE CANDLE CRIED JONDRETTE
NO SAID SHE IT WOULD EMBARRASS ME I HAVE THE TWO CHAIRS TO CARRY
THERE IS MOONLIGHT
MARIUS HEARD MOTHER JONDRETTE'S HEAVY HAND FUMBLING AT HIS LOCK IN THE
DARK
THE DOOR OPENED
HE REMAINED NAILED TO THE SPOT WITH THE SHOCK AND
WITH HORROR
THE JONDRETTE ENTERED
THE DORMER WINDOW PERMITTED THE ENTRANCE OF A RAY OF MOONLIGHT BETWEEN
TWO BLOCKS OF SHADOW
ONE OF THESE BLOCKS OF SHADOW ENTIRELY COVERED THE
WALL AGAINST WHICH MARIUS WAS LEANING SO THAT HE DISAPPEARED WITHIN IT
MOTHER JONDRETTE RAISED HER EYES DID NOT SEE MARIUS TOOK THE TWO
CHAIRS THE ONLY ONES WHICH MARIUS POSSESSED AND WENT AWAY LETTING THE
DOOR FALL HEAVILY TO BEHIND HER
SHE RE ENTERED THE LAIR
HERE ARE THE TWO CHAIRS
AND HERE IS THE LANTERN
GO DOWN AS QUICK AS YOU CAN
SHE HASTILY OBEYED AND JONDRETTE WAS LEFT ALONE
HE PLACED THE TWO CHAIRS ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE TABLE TURNED THE
CHISEL IN THE BRAZIER SET IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE AN OLD SCREEN WHICH
MASKED THE CHAFING DISH THEN WENT TO THE CORNER WHERE LAY THE PILE
OF ROPE AND BENT DOWN AS THOUGH TO EXAMINE SOMETHING
MARIUS THEN
RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT WHAT HE HAD TAKEN FOR A SHAPELESS MASS WAS A
VERY WELL MADE ROPE LADDER WITH WOODEN RUNGS AND TWO HOOKS WITH WHICH
TO ATTACH IT
THIS LADDER AND SOME LARGE TOOLS VERITABLE MASSES OF IRON WHICH WERE
MINGLED WITH THE OLD IRON PILED UP BEHIND THE DOOR HAD NOT BEEN IN THE
JONDRETTE HOVEL IN THE MORNING AND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN BROUGHT THITHER
IN THE AFTERNOON DURING MARIUS' ABSENCE
THOSE ARE THE UTENSILS OF AN EDGE TOOL MAKER THOUGHT MARIUS
HAD MARIUS BEEN A LITTLE MORE LEARNED IN THIS LINE HE WOULD HAVE
RECOGNIZED IN WHAT HE TOOK FOR THE ENGINES OF AN EDGE TOOL MAKER
CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS WHICH WILL FORCE A LOCK OR PICK A LOCK AND OTHERS
WHICH WILL CUT OR SLICE THE TWO FAMILIES OF TOOLS WHICH BURGLARS CALL
CADETS AND FAUCHANTS
THE FIREPLACE AND THE TWO CHAIRS WERE EXACTLY OPPOSITE MARIUS
THE
BRAZIER BEING CONCEALED THE ONLY LIGHT IN THE ROOM WAS NOW FURNISHED
BY THE CANDLE THE SMALLEST BIT OF CROCKERY ON THE TABLE OR ON THE
CHIMNEY PIECE CAST A LARGE SHADOW
THERE WAS SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY
CALM THREATENING AND HIDEOUS ABOUT THIS CHAMBER
ONE FELT THAT THERE
EXISTED IN IT THE ANTICIPATION OF SOMETHING TERRIBLE
JONDRETTE HAD ALLOWED HIS PIPE TO GO OUT A SERIOUS SIGN OF
PREOCCUPATION AND HAD AGAIN SEATED HIMSELF
THE CANDLE BROUGHT OUT THE
FIERCE AND THE FINE ANGLES OF HIS COUNTENANCE
HE INDULGED IN SCOWLS AND
IN ABRUPT UNFOLDINGS OF THE RIGHT HAND AS THOUGH HE WERE RESPONDING TO
THE LAST COUNSELS OF A SOMBRE INWARD MONOLOGUE
IN THE COURSE OF ONE OF
THESE DARK REPLIES WHICH HE WAS MAKING TO HIMSELF HE PULLED THE TABLE
DRAWER RAPIDLY TOWARDS HIM TOOK OUT A LONG KITCHEN KNIFE WHICH WAS
CONCEALED THERE AND TRIED THE EDGE OF ITS BLADE ON HIS NAIL
THAT DONE
HE PUT THE KNIFE BACK IN THE DRAWER AND SHUT IT
MARIUS ON HIS SIDE GRASPED THE PISTOL IN HIS RIGHT POCKET DREW IT OUT
AND COCKED IT
THE PISTOL EMITTED A SHARP CLEAR CLICK AS HE COCKED IT
JONDRETTE STARTED HALF ROSE LISTENED A MOMENT THEN BEGAN TO LAUGH AND
SAID
WHAT A FOOL I AM IT'S THE PARTITION CRACKING
MARIUS KEPT THE PISTOL IN HIS HAND
CHAPTER XVIII MARIUS' TWO CHAIRS FORM A VIS A VIS
SUDDENLY THE DISTANT AND MELANCHOLY VIBRATION OF A CLOCK SHOOK THE
PANES
SIX O'CLOCK WAS STRIKING FROM SAINT MEDARD
JONDRETTE MARKED OFF EACH STROKE WITH A TOSS OF HIS HEAD
WHEN THE SIXTH
HAD STRUCK HE SNUFFED THE CANDLE WITH HIS FINGERS
THEN HE BEGAN TO PACE UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LISTENED AT THE CORRIDOR
WALKED ON AGAIN THEN LISTENED ONCE MORE
PROVIDED ONLY THAT HE COMES HE MUTTERED THEN HE RETURNED TO HIS
CHAIR
HE HAD HARDLY RESEATED HIMSELF WHEN THE DOOR OPENED
MOTHER JONDRETTE HAD OPENED IT AND NOW REMAINED IN THE CORRIDOR MAKING
A HORRIBLE AMIABLE GRIMACE WHICH ONE OF THE HOLES OF THE DARK LANTERN
ILLUMINATED FROM BELOW
ENTER SIR SHE SAID
ENTER MY BENEFACTOR REPEATED JONDRETTE RISING HASTILY
M
LEBLANC MADE HIS APPEARANCE
HE WORE AN AIR OF SERENITY WHICH RENDERED HIM SINGULARLY VENERABLE
HE LAID FOUR LOUIS ON THE TABLE
MONSIEUR FABANTOU SAID HE THIS IS FOR YOUR RENT AND YOUR MOST
PRESSING NECESSITIES
WE WILL ATTEND TO THE REST HEREAFTER
MAY GOD REQUITE IT TO YOU MY GENEROUS BENEFACTOR SAID JONDRETTE
AND RAPIDLY APPROACHING HIS WIFE
DISMISS THE CARRIAGE
SHE SLIPPED OUT WHILE HER HUSBAND WAS LAVISHING SALUTES AND OFFERING
M
LEBLANC A CHAIR
AN INSTANT LATER SHE RETURNED AND WHISPERED IN HIS
EAR
'TIS DONE
THE SNOW WHICH HAD NOT CEASED FALLING SINCE THE MORNING WAS SO DEEP
THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIACRE HAD NOT BEEN AUDIBLE AND THEY DID NOT
NOW HEAR ITS DEPARTURE
MEANWHILE M
LEBLANC HAD SEATED HIMSELF
JONDRETTE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE OTHER CHAIR FACING M
LEBLANC
NOW IN ORDER TO FORM AN IDEA OF THE SCENE WHICH IS TO FOLLOW LET THE
READER PICTURE TO HIMSELF IN HIS OWN MIND A COLD NIGHT THE SOLITUDES
OF THE SALPETRIERE COVERED WITH SNOW AND WHITE AS WINDING SHEETS IN
THE MOONLIGHT THE TAPER LIKE LIGHTS OF THE STREET LANTERNS WHICH SHONE
REDLY HERE AND THERE ALONG THOSE TRAGIC BOULEVARDS AND THE LONG ROWS
OF BLACK ELMS NOT A PASSER BY FOR PERHAPS A QUARTER OF A LEAGUE AROUND
THE GORBEAU HOVEL AT ITS HIGHEST PITCH OF SILENCE OF HORROR AND OF
DARKNESS IN THAT BUILDING IN THE MIDST OF THOSE SOLITUDES IN THE
MIDST OF THAT DARKNESS THE VAST JONDRETTE GARRET LIGHTED BY A SINGLE
CANDLE AND IN THAT DEN TWO MEN SEATED AT A TABLE M
LEBLANC TRANQUIL
JONDRETTE SMILING AND ALARMING THE JONDRETTE WOMAN THE FEMALE WOLF
IN ONE CORNER AND BEHIND THE PARTITION MARIUS INVISIBLE ERECT NOT
LOSING A WORD NOT MISSING A SINGLE MOVEMENT HIS EYE ON THE WATCH AND
PISTOL IN HAND
HOWEVER MARIUS EXPERIENCED ONLY AN EMOTION OF HORROR BUT NO FEAR
HE
CLASPED THE STOCK OF THE PISTOL FIRMLY AND FELT REASSURED
I SHALL BE
ABLE TO STOP THAT WRETCH WHENEVER I PLEASE HE THOUGHT
HE FELT THAT THE POLICE WERE THERE SOMEWHERE IN AMBUSCADE WAITING FOR
THE SIGNAL AGREED UPON AND READY TO STRETCH OUT THEIR ARM
MOREOVER HE WAS IN HOPES THAT THIS VIOLENT ENCOUNTER BETWEEN JONDRETTE
AND M
LEBLANC WOULD CAST SOME LIGHT ON ALL THE THINGS WHICH HE WAS
INTERESTED IN LEARNING
CHAPTER XIX OCCUPYING ONE'S SELF WITH OBSCURE DEPTHS
HARDLY WAS M
LEBLANC SEATED WHEN HE TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE
PALLETS WHICH WERE EMPTY
HOW IS THE POOR LITTLE WOUNDED GIRL HE INQUIRED
BAD REPLIED JONDRETTE WITH A HEART BROKEN AND GRATEFUL SMILE VERY
BAD MY WORTHY SIR
HER ELDER SISTER HAS TAKEN HER TO THE BOURBE TO
HAVE HER HURT DRESSED
YOU WILL SEE THEM PRESENTLY THEY WILL BE BACK
IMMEDIATELY
MADAME FABANTOU SEEMS TO ME TO BE BETTER WENT ON M
LEBLANC CASTING
HIS EYES ON THE ECCENTRIC COSTUME OF THE JONDRETTE WOMAN AS SHE STOOD
BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR AS THOUGH ALREADY GUARDING THE EXIT AND GAZED
AT HIM IN AN ATTITUDE OF MENACE AND ALMOST OF COMBAT
SHE IS DYING SAID JONDRETTE
BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT SIR SHE HAS SO
MUCH COURAGE THAT WOMAN HAS SHE'S NOT A WOMAN SHE'S AN OX
THE JONDRETTE TOUCHED BY HIS COMPLIMENT DEPRECATED IT WITH THE
AFFECTED AIRS OF A FLATTERED MONSTER
YOU ARE ALWAYS TOO GOOD TO ME MONSIEUR JONDRETTE
JONDRETTE SAID M
LEBLANC I THOUGHT YOUR NAME WAS FABANTOU
FABANTOU ALIAS JONDRETTE REPLIED THE HUSBAND HURRIEDLY
AN ARTISTIC
SOBRIQUET
AND LAUNCHING AT HIS WIFE A SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS WHICH M
LEBLANC DID
NOT CATCH HE CONTINUED WITH AN EMPHATIC AND CARESSING INFLECTION OF
VOICE
AH WE HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE TOGETHER THIS POOR DARLING AND I WHAT
WOULD THERE BE LEFT FOR US IF WE HAD NOT THAT WE ARE SO WRETCHED MY
RESPECTABLE SIR WE HAVE ARMS BUT THERE IS NO WORK WE HAVE THE WILL
NO WORK I DON'T KNOW HOW THE GOVERNMENT ARRANGES THAT BUT ON MY WORD
OF HONOR SIR I AM NOT JACOBIN SIR I AM NOT A BOUSINGOT 30 I DON'T
WISH THEM ANY EVIL BUT IF I WERE THE MINISTERS ON MY MOST SACRED WORD
THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT
HERE FOR INSTANCE I WANTED TO HAVE MY
GIRLS TAUGHT THE TRADE OF PAPER BOX MAKERS
YOU WILL SAY TO ME 'WHAT
A TRADE YES A TRADE A SIMPLE TRADE A BREAD WINNER WHAT A FALL
MY BENEFACTOR WHAT A DEGRADATION WHEN ONE HAS BEEN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
ALAS THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO US OF OUR DAYS OF PROSPERITY ONE THING
ONLY A PICTURE OF WHICH I THINK A GREAT DEAL BUT WHICH I AM WILLING
TO PART WITH FOR I MUST LIVE ITEM ONE MUST LIVE
WHILE JONDRETTE THUS TALKED WITH AN APPARENT INCOHERENCE WHICH
DETRACTED NOTHING FROM THE THOUGHTFUL AND SAGACIOUS EXPRESSION OF HIS
PHYSIOGNOMY MARIUS RAISED HIS EYES AND PERCEIVED AT THE OTHER END OF
THE ROOM A PERSON WHOM HE HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE
A MAN HAD JUST ENTERED
SO SOFTLY THAT THE DOOR HAD NOT BEEN HEARD TO TURN ON ITS HINGES
THIS
MAN WORE A VIOLET KNITTED VEST WHICH WAS OLD WORN SPOTTED CUT AND
GAPING AT EVERY FOLD WIDE TROUSERS OF COTTON VELVET WOODEN SHOES ON
HIS FEET NO SHIRT HAD HIS NECK BARE HIS BARE ARMS TATTOOED AND HIS
FACE SMEARED WITH BLACK
HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF IN SILENCE ON THE NEAREST
BED AND AS HE WAS BEHIND JONDRETTE HE COULD ONLY BE INDISTINCTLY
SEEN
THAT SORT OF MAGNETIC INSTINCT WHICH TURNS ASIDE THE GAZE CAUSED M
LEBLANC TO TURN ROUND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT AS MARIUS
HE COULD NOT
REFRAIN FROM A GESTURE OF SURPRISE WHICH DID NOT ESCAPE JONDRETTE
AH I SEE EXCLAIMED JONDRETTE BUTTONING UP HIS COAT WITH AN AIR OF
COMPLAISANCE YOU ARE LOOKING AT YOUR OVERCOAT IT FITS ME MY FAITH
BUT IT FITS ME
WHO IS THAT MAN SAID M
LEBLANC
HIM EJACULATED JONDRETTE HE'S A NEIGHBOR OF MINE
DON'T PAY ANY
ATTENTION TO HIM
THE NEIGHBOR WAS A SINGULAR LOOKING INDIVIDUAL
HOWEVER MANUFACTORIES
OF CHEMICAL PRODUCTS ABOUND IN THE FAUBOURG SAINT MARCEAU
MANY OF THE
WORKMEN MIGHT HAVE BLACK FACES
BESIDES THIS M
LEBLANC'S WHOLE PERSON
WAS EXPRESSIVE OF CANDID AND INTREPID CONFIDENCE
HE WENT ON
EXCUSE ME WHAT WERE YOU SAYING M
FABANTOU
I WAS TELLING YOU SIR AND DEAR PROTECTOR REPLIED JONDRETTE PLACING
HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND CONTEMPLATING M
LEBLANC WITH STEADY AND
TENDER EYES NOT UNLIKE THE EYES OF THE BOA CONSTRICTOR I WAS TELLING
YOU THAT I HAVE A PICTURE TO SELL
A SLIGHT SOUND CAME FROM THE DOOR
A SECOND MAN HAD JUST ENTERED AND
SEATED HIMSELF ON THE BED BEHIND JONDRETTE
LIKE THE FIRST HIS ARMS WERE BARE AND HE HAD A MASK OF INK OR
LAMPBLACK
ALTHOUGH THIS MAN HAD LITERALLY GLIDED INTO THE ROOM HE HAD NOT BEEN
ABLE TO PREVENT M
LEBLANC CATCHING SIGHT OF HIM
DON'T MIND THEM SAID JONDRETTE THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO BELONG IN THE
HOUSE
SO I WAS SAYING THAT THERE REMAINS IN MY POSSESSION A VALUABLE
PICTURE
BUT STOP SIR TAKE A LOOK AT IT
HE ROSE WENT TO THE WALL AT THE FOOT OF WHICH STOOD THE PANEL WHICH WE
HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED AND TURNED IT ROUND STILL LEAVING IT SUPPORTED
AGAINST THE WALL
IT REALLY WAS SOMETHING WHICH RESEMBLED A PICTURE AND
WHICH THE CANDLE ILLUMINATED SOMEWHAT
MARIUS COULD MAKE NOTHING OUT OF
IT AS JONDRETTE STOOD BETWEEN THE PICTURE AND HIM HE ONLY SAW A COARSE
DAUB AND A SORT OF PRINCIPAL PERSONAGE COLORED WITH THE HARSH CRUDITY
OF FOREIGN CANVASSES AND SCREEN PAINTINGS
WHAT IS THAT ASKED M
LEBLANC
JONDRETTE EXCLAIMED
A PAINTING BY A MASTER A PICTURE OF GREAT VALUE MY BENEFACTOR I AM
AS MUCH ATTACHED TO IT AS I AM TO MY TWO DAUGHTERS IT RECALLS SOUVENIRS
TO ME BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU AND I WILL NOT TAKE IT BACK THAT I AM SO
WRETCHED THAT I WILL PART WITH IT
EITHER BY CHANCE OR BECAUSE HE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL A DAWNING UNEASINESS
M
LEBLANC'S GLANCE RETURNED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ROOM AS HE EXAMINED
THE PICTURE
THERE WERE NOW FOUR MEN THREE SEATED ON THE BED ONE STANDING NEAR THE
DOOR POST ALL FOUR WITH BARE ARMS AND MOTIONLESS WITH FACES SMEARED
WITH BLACK
ONE OF THOSE ON THE BED WAS LEANING AGAINST THE WALL WITH
CLOSED EYES AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ASLEEP
HE
WAS OLD HIS WHITE HAIR CONTRASTING WITH HIS BLACKENED FACE PRODUCED A
HORRIBLE EFFECT
THE OTHER TWO SEEMED TO BE YOUNG ONE WORE A BEARD THE
OTHER WORE HIS HAIR LONG
NONE OF THEM HAD ON SHOES THOSE WHO DID NOT
WEAR SOCKS WERE BAREFOOTED
JONDRETTE NOTICED THAT M
LEBLANC'S EYE WAS FIXED ON THESE MEN
THEY ARE FRIENDS
THEY ARE NEIGHBORS SAID HE
THEIR FACES ARE BLACK
BECAUSE THEY WORK IN CHARCOAL
THEY ARE CHIMNEY BUILDERS
DON'T TROUBLE
YOURSELF ABOUT THEM MY BENEFACTOR BUT BUY MY PICTURE
HAVE PITY ON
MY MISERY
I WILL NOT ASK YOU MUCH FOR IT
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT IS
WORTH
WELL SAID M
LEBLANC LOOKING JONDRETTE FULL IN THE EYE AND WITH THE
MANNER OF A MAN WHO IS ON HIS GUARD IT IS SOME SIGNBOARD FOR A TAVERN
AND IS WORTH ABOUT THREE FRANCS
JONDRETTE REPLIED SWEETLY
HAVE YOU YOUR POCKET BOOK WITH YOU I SHOULD BE SATISFIED WITH A
THOUSAND CROWNS
M
LEBLANC SPRANG UP PLACED HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL AND CAST A RAPID
GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM
HE HAD JONDRETTE ON HIS LEFT ON THE SIDE NEXT
THE WINDOW AND THE JONDRETTE WOMAN AND THE FOUR MEN ON HIS RIGHT ON
THE SIDE NEXT THE DOOR
THE FOUR MEN DID NOT STIR AND DID NOT EVEN SEEM
TO BE LOOKING ON
JONDRETTE HAD AGAIN BEGUN TO SPEAK IN A PLAINTIVE TONE WITH SO VAGUE
AN EYE AND SO LAMENTABLE AN INTONATION THAT M
LEBLANC MIGHT HAVE
SUPPOSED THAT WHAT HE HAD BEFORE HIM WAS A MAN WHO HAD SIMPLY GONE MAD
WITH MISERY
IF YOU DO NOT BUY MY PICTURE MY DEAR BENEFACTOR SAID JONDRETTE I
SHALL BE LEFT WITHOUT RESOURCES THERE WILL BE NOTHING LEFT FOR ME BUT
TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE RIVER
WHEN I THINK THAT I WANTED TO HAVE MY
TWO GIRLS TAUGHT THE MIDDLE CLASS PAPER BOX TRADE THE MAKING OF BOXES
FOR NEW YEAR'S GIFTS WELL A TABLE WITH A BOARD AT THE END TO KEEP THE
GLASSES FROM FALLING OFF IS REQUIRED THEN A SPECIAL STOVE IS NEEDED A
POT WITH THREE COMPARTMENTS FOR THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF STRENGTH OF
THE PASTE ACCORDING AS IT IS TO BE USED FOR WOOD PAPER OR STUFF A
PARING KNIFE TO CUT THE CARDBOARD A MOULD TO ADJUST IT A HAMMER TO
NAIL THE STEELS PINCERS HOW THE DEVIL DO I KNOW WHAT ALL AND ALL THAT
IN ORDER TO EARN FOUR SOUS A DAY AND YOU HAVE TO WORK FOURTEEN HOURS A
DAY AND EACH BOX PASSES THROUGH THE WORKWOMAN'S HANDS THIRTEEN TIMES
AND YOU CAN'T WET THE PAPER AND YOU MUSTN'T SPOT ANYTHING AND YOU MUST
KEEP THE PASTE HOT
THE DEVIL I TELL YOU FOUR SOUS A DAY HOW DO YOU
SUPPOSE A MAN IS TO LIVE
AS HE SPOKE JONDRETTE DID NOT LOOK AT M
LEBLANC WHO WAS OBSERVING
HIM
M
LEBLANC'S EYE WAS FIXED ON JONDRETTE AND JONDRETTE'S EYE WAS
FIXED ON THE DOOR
MARIUS' EAGER ATTENTION WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE
TO THE OTHER
M
LEBLANC SEEMED TO BE ASKING HIMSELF IS THIS MAN AN
IDIOT JONDRETTE REPEATED TWO OR THREE DISTINCT TIMES WITH ALL MANNER
OF VARYING INFLECTIONS OF THE WHINING AND SUPPLICATING ORDER THERE
IS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME BUT TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE RIVER I WENT DOWN
THREE STEPS AT THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE OF AUSTERLITZ THE OTHER DAY FOR
THAT PURPOSE
ALL AT ONCE HIS DULL EYES LIGHTED UP WITH A HIDEOUS FLASH THE LITTLE
MAN DREW HIMSELF UP AND BECAME TERRIBLE TOOK A STEP TOWARD M
LEBLANC
AND CRIED IN A VOICE OF THUNDER THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
QUESTION DO YOU KNOW ME
CHAPTER XX THE TRAP
THE DOOR OF THE GARRET HAD JUST OPENED ABRUPTLY AND ALLOWED A VIEW OF
THREE MEN CLAD IN BLUE LINEN BLOUSES AND MASKED WITH MASKS OF BLACK
PAPER
THE FIRST WAS THIN AND HAD A LONG IRON TIPPED CUDGEL THE
SECOND WHO WAS A SORT OF COLOSSUS CARRIED BY THE MIDDLE OF THE
HANDLE WITH THE BLADE DOWNWARD A BUTCHER'S POLE AXE FOR SLAUGHTERING
CATTLE
THE THIRD A MAN WITH THICK SET SHOULDERS NOT SO SLENDER AS
THE FIRST HELD IN HIS HAND AN ENORMOUS KEY STOLEN FROM THE DOOR OF SOME
PRISON
IT APPEARED THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THESE MEN WAS WHAT JONDRETTE HAD BEEN
WAITING FOR
A RAPID DIALOGUE ENSUED BETWEEN HIM AND THE MAN WITH THE
CUDGEL THE THIN ONE
IS EVERYTHING READY SAID JONDRETTE
YES REPLIED THE THIN MAN
WHERE IS MONTPARNASSE
THE YOUNG PRINCIPAL ACTOR STOPPED TO CHAT WITH YOUR GIRL
WHICH
THE ELDEST
IS THERE A CARRIAGE AT THE DOOR
YES
IS THE TEAM HARNESSED
YES
WITH TWO GOOD HORSES
EXCELLENT
IS IT WAITING WHERE I ORDERED
YES
GOOD SAID JONDRETTE
M
LEBLANC WAS VERY PALE
HE WAS SCRUTINIZING EVERYTHING AROUND HIM IN
THE DEN LIKE A MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT HE HAS FALLEN INTO AND HIS
HEAD DIRECTED IN TURN TOWARD ALL THE HEADS WHICH SURROUNDED HIM MOVED
ON HIS NECK WITH AN ASTONISHED AND ATTENTIVE SLOWNESS BUT THERE
WAS NOTHING IN HIS AIR WHICH RESEMBLED FEAR
HE HAD IMPROVISED
AN INTRENCHMENT OUT OF THE TABLE AND THE MAN WHO BUT AN INSTANT
PREVIOUSLY HAD BORNE MERELY THE APPEARANCE OF A KINDLY OLD MAN HAD
SUDDENLY BECOME A SORT OF ATHLETE AND PLACED HIS ROBUST FIST ON THE
BACK OF HIS CHAIR WITH A FORMIDABLE AND SURPRISING GESTURE
THIS OLD MAN WHO WAS SO FIRM AND SO BRAVE IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A
DANGER SEEMED TO POSSESS ONE OF THOSE NATURES WHICH ARE AS COURAGEOUS
AS THEY ARE KIND BOTH EASILY AND SIMPLY
THE FATHER OF A WOMAN WHOM WE
LOVE IS NEVER A STRANGER TO US
MARIUS FELT PROUD OF THAT UNKNOWN MAN
THREE OF THE MEN OF WHOM JONDRETTE HAD SAID THEY ARE
CHIMNEY BUILDERS HAD ARMED THEMSELVES FROM THE PILE OF OLD IRON ONE
WITH A HEAVY PAIR OF SHEARS THE SECOND WITH WEIGHING TONGS THE THIRD
WITH A HAMMER AND HAD PLACED THEMSELVES ACROSS THE ENTRANCE WITHOUT
UTTERING A SYLLABLE
THE OLD MAN HAD REMAINED ON THE BED AND HAD MERELY
OPENED HIS EYES
THE JONDRETTE WOMAN HAD SEATED HERSELF BESIDE HIM
MARIUS DECIDED THAT IN A FEW SECONDS MORE THE MOMENT FOR INTERVENTION
WOULD ARRIVE AND HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND TOWARDS THE CEILING IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE CORRIDOR IN READINESS TO DISCHARGE HIS PISTOL
JONDRETTE HAVING TERMINATED HIS COLLOQUY WITH THE MAN WITH THE CUDGEL
TURNED ONCE MORE TO M
LEBLANC AND REPEATED HIS QUESTION ACCOMPANYING
IT WITH THAT LOW REPRESSED AND TERRIBLE LAUGH WHICH WAS PECULIAR TO
HIM
SO YOU DO NOT RECOGNIZE ME
M
LEBLANC LOOKED HIM FULL IN THE FACE AND REPLIED
NO
THEN JONDRETTE ADVANCED TO THE TABLE
HE LEANED ACROSS THE CANDLE
CROSSING HIS ARMS PUTTING HIS ANGULAR AND FEROCIOUS JAW CLOSE TO M
LEBLANC'S CALM FACE AND ADVANCING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT FORCING M
LEBLANC TO RETREAT AND IN THIS POSTURE OF A WILD BEAST WHO IS ABOUT TO
BITE HE EXCLAIMED
MY NAME IS NOT FABANTOU MY NAME IS NOT JONDRETTE MY NAME IS
THENARDIER
I AM THE INN KEEPER OF MONTFERMEIL DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THENARDIER NOW DO YOU KNOW ME
AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE FLUSH CROSSED M
LEBLANC'S BROW AND HE REPLIED
WITH A VOICE WHICH NEITHER TREMBLED NOR ROSE ABOVE ITS ORDINARY LEVEL
WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED PLACIDITY
NO MORE THAN BEFORE
MARIUS DID NOT HEAR THIS REPLY
ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN HIM AT THAT MOMENT
THROUGH THE DARKNESS WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS HAGGARD
STUPID THUNDER STRUCK
AT THE MOMENT WHEN JONDRETTE SAID MY NAME IS
THENARDIER MARIUS HAD TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB AND HAD LEANED AGAINST
THE WALL AS THOUGH HE FELT THE COLD OF A STEEL BLADE THROUGH HIS HEART
THEN HIS RIGHT ARM ALL READY TO DISCHARGE THE SIGNAL SHOT DROPPED
SLOWLY AND AT THE MOMENT WHEN JONDRETTE REPEATED THENARDIER DO YOU
UNDERSTAND MARIUS'S FALTERING FINGERS HAD COME NEAR LETTING THE PISTOL
FALL
JONDRETTE BY REVEALING HIS IDENTITY HAD NOT MOVED M
LEBLANC
BUT HE HAD QUITE UPSET MARIUS
THAT NAME OF THENARDIER WITH WHICH M
LEBLANC DID NOT SEEM TO BE ACQUAINTED MARIUS KNEW WELL
LET THE READER
RECALL WHAT THAT NAME MEANT TO HIM THAT NAME HE HAD WORN ON HIS HEART
INSCRIBED IN HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT HE BORE IT AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS
MIND IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS MEMORY IN THAT SACRED INJUNCTION A CERTAIN
THENARDIER SAVED MY LIFE
IF MY SON ENCOUNTERS HIM HE WILL DO HIM ALL
THE GOOD THAT LIES IN HIS POWER THAT NAME IT WILL BE REMEMBERED
WAS ONE OF THE PIETIES OF HIS SOUL HE MINGLED IT WITH THE NAME OF
HIS FATHER IN HIS WORSHIP
WHAT THIS MAN WAS THAT THENARDIER THAT
INN KEEPER OF MONTFERMEIL WHOM HE HAD SO LONG AND SO VAINLY SOUGHT HE
HAD FOUND HIM AT LAST AND HOW HIS FATHER'S SAVIOUR WAS A RUFFIAN
THAT MAN TO WHOSE SERVICE MARIUS WAS BURNING TO DEVOTE HIMSELF WAS
A MONSTER THAT LIBERATOR OF COLONEL PONTMERCY WAS ON THE POINT
OF COMMITTING A CRIME WHOSE SCOPE MARIUS DID NOT AS YET CLEARLY
COMPREHEND BUT WHICH RESEMBLED AN ASSASSINATION AND AGAINST WHOM
GREAT GOD WHAT A FATALITY WHAT A BITTER MOCKERY OF FATE HIS FATHER
HAD COMMANDED HIM FROM THE DEPTHS OF HIS COFFIN TO DO ALL THE GOOD IN
HIS POWER TO THIS THENARDIER AND FOR FOUR YEARS MARIUS HAD CHERISHED
NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN TO ACQUIT THIS DEBT OF HIS FATHER'S AND AT THE
MOMENT WHEN HE WAS ON THE EVE OF HAVING A BRIGAND SEIZED IN THE VERY
ACT OF CRIME BY JUSTICE DESTINY CRIED TO HIM THIS IS THENARDIER
HE COULD AT LAST REPAY THIS MAN FOR HIS FATHER'S LIFE SAVED AMID A
HAIL STORM OF GRAPE SHOT ON THE HEROIC FIELD OF WATERLOO AND REPAY IT
WITH THE SCAFFOLD HE HAD SWORN TO HIMSELF THAT IF EVER HE FOUND THAT
THENARDIER HE WOULD ADDRESS HIM ONLY BY THROWING HIMSELF AT HIS FEET
AND NOW HE ACTUALLY HAD FOUND HIM BUT IT WAS ONLY TO DELIVER HIM OVER
TO THE EXECUTIONER HIS FATHER SAID TO HIM SUCCOR THENARDIER AND HE
REPLIED TO THAT ADORED AND SAINTED VOICE BY CRUSHING THENARDIER HE WAS
ABOUT TO OFFER TO HIS FATHER IN HIS GRAVE THE SPECTACLE OF THAT MAN WHO
HAD TORN HIM FROM DEATH AT THE PERIL OF HIS OWN LIFE EXECUTED ON THE
PLACE SAINT JACQUES THROUGH THE MEANS OF HIS SON OF THAT MARIUS TO WHOM
HE HAD ENTRUSTED THAT MAN BY HIS WILL AND WHAT A MOCKERY TO HAVE SO
LONG WORN ON HIS BREAST HIS FATHER'S LAST COMMANDS WRITTEN IN HIS OWN
HAND ONLY TO ACT IN SO HORRIBLY CONTRARY A SENSE BUT ON THE OTHER
HAND NOW LOOK ON THAT TRAP AND NOT PREVENT IT CONDEMN THE VICTIM AND
TO SPARE THE ASSASSIN COULD ONE BE HELD TO ANY GRATITUDE TOWARDS SO
MISERABLE A WRETCH ALL THE IDEAS WHICH MARIUS HAD CHERISHED FOR THE
LAST FOUR YEARS WERE PIERCED THROUGH AND THROUGH AS IT WERE BY THIS
UNFORESEEN BLOW
HE SHUDDERED
EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON HIM
UNKNOWN TO THEMSELVES HE
HELD IN HIS HAND ALL THOSE BEINGS WHO WERE MOVING ABOUT THERE BEFORE HIS
EYES
IF HE FIRED HIS PISTOL M
LEBLANC WAS SAVED AND THENARDIER LOST
IF HE DID NOT FIRE M
LEBLANC WOULD BE SACRIFICED AND WHO KNOWS
THENARDIER WOULD ESCAPE
SHOULD HE DASH DOWN THE ONE OR ALLOW THE OTHER
TO FALL REMORSE AWAITED HIM IN EITHER CASE
WHAT WAS HE TO DO WHAT SHOULD HE CHOOSE BE FALSE TO THE MOST IMPERIOUS
SOUVENIRS TO ALL THOSE SOLEMN VOWS TO HIMSELF TO THE MOST SACRED DUTY
TO THE MOST VENERATED TEXT SHOULD HE IGNORE HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT
OR ALLOW THE PERPETRATION OF A CRIME ON THE ONE HAND IT SEEMED TO HIM
THAT HE HEARD HIS URSULE SUPPLICATING FOR HER FATHER AND ON THE OTHER
THE COLONEL COMMENDING THENARDIER TO HIS CARE
HE FELT THAT HE WAS GOING
MAD
HIS KNEES GAVE WAY BENEATH HIM
AND HE HAD NOT EVEN THE TIME FOR
DELIBERATION SO GREAT WAS THE FURY WITH WHICH THE SCENE BEFORE HIS EYES
WAS HASTENING TO ITS CATASTROPHE
IT WAS LIKE A WHIRLWIND OF WHICH HE
HAD THOUGHT HIMSELF THE MASTER AND WHICH WAS NOW SWEEPING HIM AWAY
HE
WAS ON THE VERGE OF SWOONING
IN THE MEANTIME THENARDIER WHOM WE SHALL HENCEFORTH CALL BY NO OTHER
NAME WAS PACING UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THE TABLE IN A SORT OF FRENZY
AND WILD TRIUMPH
HE SEIZED THE CANDLE IN HIS FIST AND SET IT ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE WITH
SO VIOLENT A BANG THAT THE WICK CAME NEAR BEING EXTINGUISHED AND THE
TALLOW BESPATTERED THE WALL
THEN HE TURNED TO M
LEBLANC WITH A HORRIBLE LOOK AND SPIT OUT THESE
WORDS
DONE FOR SMOKED BROWN COOKED SPITCHCOCKED
AND AGAIN HE BEGAN TO MARCH BACK AND FORTH IN FULL ERUPTION
AH HE CRIED SO I'VE FOUND YOU AGAIN AT LAST MISTER PHILANTHROPIST

CAN'T CALL THINGS QUITS BECAUSE AFTERWARDS WHEN PEOPLE ARE RUINED YOU

OLD BLACKGUARD YOU CHILD STEALER
HE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO BE TALKING TO HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT
ONE WOULD
HAVE SAID THAT HIS WRATH HAD FALLEN INTO SOME HOLE LIKE THE RHONE
THEN AS THOUGH HE WERE CONCLUDING ALOUD THE THINGS WHICH HE HAD BEEN
SAYING TO HIMSELF IN A WHISPER HE SMOTE THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST AND
SHOUTED
AND WITH HIS GOODY GOODY AIR
AND APOSTROPHIZING M
LEBLANC

MISFORTUNES FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS YOU GOT A GIRL WHOM I HAD AND

4TH OF FEBRUARY IS THE TIME WHEN THE QUARTER RUNS OUT ABSURD IDIOT
AND THE FOUR MISERABLE PHILIPPES WHICH HE HAS BROUGHT ME SCOUNDREL

HE SWALLOWED MY PLATITUDES THAT DID AMUSE ME
I SAID TO MYSELF
'BLOCKHEAD COME I'VE GOT YOU I LICK YOUR PAWS THIS MORNING BUT I'LL
GNAW YOUR HEART THIS EVENING
THENARDIER PAUSED
HE WAS OUT OF BREATH
HIS LITTLE NARROW CHEST PANTED
LIKE A FORGE BELLOWS
HIS EYES WERE FULL OF THE IGNOBLE HAPPINESS OF A
FEEBLE CRUEL AND COWARDLY CREATURE WHICH FINDS THAT IT CAN AT LAST
HARASS WHAT IT HAS FEARED AND INSULT WHAT IT HAS FLATTERED THE JOY OF
A DWARF WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO SET HIS HEEL ON THE HEAD OF GOLIATH THE
JOY OF A JACKAL WHICH IS BEGINNING TO REND A SICK BULL SO NEARLY DEAD
THAT HE CAN NO LONGER DEFEND HIMSELF BUT SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO SUFFER
STILL
M
LEBLANC DID NOT INTERRUPT HIM BUT SAID TO HIM WHEN HE PAUSED
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY

WHO HAS NOT REMARKED THE FACT THAT ODIOUS CREATURES POSSESS A
SUSCEPTIBILITY OF THEIR OWN THAT MONSTERS ARE TICKLISH AT THIS WORD
VILLAIN THE FEMALE THENARDIER SPRANG FROM THE BED THENARDIER GRASPED
HIS CHAIR AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO CRUSH IT IN HIS HANDS

ADDED WITH A SHUDDER
WHEN I THINK THAT HE HAS DARED TO COME HERE AND TALK TO ME LIKE A
COBBLER
THEN ADDRESSING M
LEBLANC WITH A FRESH OUTBURST OF FRENZY
AND LISTEN TO THIS ALSO MISTER PHILANTHROPIST I'M NOT A SUSPICIOUS
CHARACTER NOT A BIT OF IT I'M NOT A MAN WHOSE NAME NOBODY KNOWS AND
WHO COMES AND ABDUCTS CHILDREN FROM HOUSES I'M AN OLD FRENCH SOLDIER
I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DECORATED I WAS AT WATERLOO SO I WAS AND IN THE
BATTLE I SAVED A GENERAL CALLED THE COMTE OF I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE TOLD
ME HIS NAME BUT HIS BEASTLY VOICE WAS SO WEAK THAT I DIDN'T HEAR
ALL I
CAUGHT WAS MERCI THANKS
I'D RATHER HAVE HAD HIS NAME THAN HIS THANKS
THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED ME TO FIND HIM AGAIN
THE PICTURE THAT YOU SEE
HERE AND WHICH WAS PAINTED BY DAVID AT BRUQUESELLES DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT REPRESENTS IT REPRESENTS ME
DAVID WISHED TO IMMORTALIZE THAT
FEAT OF PROWESS
I HAVE THAT GENERAL ON MY BACK AND I AM CARRYING HIM
THROUGH THE GRAPE SHOT
THERE'S THE HISTORY OF IT THAT GENERAL NEVER
DID A SINGLE THING FOR ME HE WAS NO BETTER THAN THE REST BUT NONE THE
LESS I SAVED HIS LIFE AT THE RISK OF MY OWN AND I HAVE THE CERTIFICATE
OF THE FACT IN MY POCKET I AM A SOLDIER OF WATERLOO BY ALL THE FURIES
AND NOW THAT I HAVE HAD THE GOODNESS TO TELL YOU ALL THIS LET'S HAVE AN
END OF IT
I WANT MONEY I WANT A DEAL OF MONEY I MUST HAVE AN ENORMOUS
LOT OF MONEY OR I'LL EXTERMINATE YOU BY THE THUNDER OF THE GOOD GOD
MARIUS HAD REGAINED SOME MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER HIS ANGUISH AND WAS
LISTENING
THE LAST POSSIBILITY OF DOUBT HAD JUST VANISHED
IT CERTAINLY
WAS THE THENARDIER OF THE WILL
MARIUS SHUDDERED AT THAT REPROACH OF
INGRATITUDE DIRECTED AGAINST HIS FATHER AND WHICH HE WAS ON THE POINT
OF SO FATALLY JUSTIFYING
HIS PERPLEXITY WAS REDOUBLED
MOREOVER THERE WAS IN ALL THESE WORDS OF THENARDIER IN HIS ACCENT IN
HIS GESTURE IN HIS GLANCE WHICH DARTED FLAMES AT EVERY WORD THERE
WAS IN THIS EXPLOSION OF AN EVIL NATURE DISCLOSING EVERYTHING IN THAT
MIXTURE OF BRAGGADOCIO AND ABJECTNESS OF PRIDE AND PETTINESS OF RAGE
AND FOLLY IN THAT CHAOS OF REAL GRIEFS AND FALSE SENTIMENTS IN
THAT IMMODESTY OF A MALICIOUS MAN TASTING THE VOLUPTUOUS DELIGHTS
OF VIOLENCE IN THAT SHAMELESS NUDITY OF A REPULSIVE SOUL IN THAT
CONFLAGRATION OF ALL SUFFERINGS COMBINED WITH ALL HATREDS SOMETHING
WHICH WAS AS HIDEOUS AS EVIL AND AS HEART RENDING AS THE TRUTH
THE PICTURE OF THE MASTER THE PAINTING BY DAVID WHICH HE HAD PROPOSED
THAT M
LEBLANC SHOULD PURCHASE WAS NOTHING ELSE AS THE READER HAS
DIVINED THAN THE SIGN OF HIS TAVERN PAINTED AS IT WILL BE REMEMBERED
BY HIMSELF THE ONLY RELIC WHICH HE HAD PRESERVED FROM HIS SHIPWRECK AT
MONTFERMEIL
AS HE HAD CEASED TO INTERCEPT MARIUS' VISUAL RAY MARIUS COULD EXAMINE
THIS THING AND IN THE DAUB HE ACTUALLY DID RECOGNIZE A BATTLE A
BACKGROUND OF SMOKE AND A MAN CARRYING ANOTHER MAN
IT WAS THE GROUP
COMPOSED OF PONTMERCY AND THENARDIER THE SERGEANT THE RESCUER THE
COLONEL RESCUED
MARIUS WAS LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN THIS PICTURE RESTORED
HIS FATHER TO LIFE IN SOME SORT IT WAS NO LONGER THE SIGNBOARD OF THE
WINE SHOP AT MONTFERMEIL IT WAS A RESURRECTION A TOMB HAD YAWNED A
PHANTOM HAD RISEN THERE
MARIUS HEARD HIS HEART BEATING IN HIS TEMPLES
HE HAD THE CANNON OF WATERLOO IN HIS EARS HIS BLEEDING FATHER VAGUELY
DEPICTED ON THAT SINISTER PANEL TERRIFIED HIM AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT
THE MISSHAPEN SPECTRE WAS GAZING INTENTLY AT HIM
WHEN THENARDIER HAD RECOVERED HIS BREATH HE TURNED HIS BLOODSHOT EYES
ON M
LEBLANC AND SAID TO HIM IN A LOW CURT VOICE
WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY BEFORE WE PUT THE HANDCUFFS ON YOU
M
LEBLANC HELD HIS PEACE
IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE A CRACKED VOICE LAUNCHED THIS LUGUBRIOUS
SARCASM FROM THE CORRIDOR
IF THERE'S ANY WOOD TO BE SPLIT I'M THERE
IT WAS THE MAN WITH THE AXE WHO WAS GROWING MERRY
AT THE SAME MOMENT AN ENORMOUS BRISTLING AND CLAYEY FACE MADE ITS
APPEARANCE AT THE DOOR WITH A HIDEOUS LAUGH WHICH EXHIBITED NOT TEETH
BUT FANGS
IT WAS THE FACE OF THE MAN WITH THE BUTCHER'S AXE
WHY HAVE YOU TAKEN OFF YOUR MASK CRIED THENARDIER IN A RAGE
FOR FUN RETORTED THE MAN
FOR THE LAST FEW MINUTES M
LEBLANC HAD APPEARED TO BE WATCHING AND
FOLLOWING ALL THE MOVEMENTS OF THENARDIER WHO BLINDED AND DAZZLED BY
HIS OWN RAGE WAS STALKING TO AND FRO IN THE DEN WITH FULL CONFIDENCE
THAT THE DOOR WAS GUARDED AND OF HOLDING AN UNARMED MAN FAST HE BEING
ARMED HIMSELF OF BEING NINE AGAINST ONE SUPPOSING THAT THE FEMALE
THENARDIER COUNTED FOR BUT ONE MAN
DURING HIS ADDRESS TO THE MAN WITH THE POLE AXE HE HAD TURNED HIS BACK
TO M
LEBLANC
M
LEBLANC SEIZED THIS MOMENT OVERTURNED THE CHAIR WITH HIS FOOT AND
THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST AND WITH ONE BOUND WITH PRODIGIOUS AGILITY
BEFORE THENARDIER HAD TIME TO TURN ROUND HE HAD REACHED THE WINDOW
TO
OPEN IT TO SCALE THE FRAME TO BESTRIDE IT WAS THE WORK OF A SECOND
ONLY
HE WAS HALF OUT WHEN SIX ROBUST FISTS SEIZED HIM AND DRAGGED
HIM BACK ENERGETICALLY INTO THE HOVEL
THESE WERE THE THREE
CHIMNEY BUILDERS WHO HAD FLUNG THEMSELVES UPON HIM
AT THE SAME TIME
THE THENARDIER WOMAN HAD WOUND HER HANDS IN HIS HAIR
AT THE TRAMPLING WHICH ENSUED THE OTHER RUFFIANS RUSHED UP FROM THE
CORRIDOR
THE OLD MAN ON THE BED WHO SEEMED UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF WINE DESCENDED FROM THE PALLET AND CAME REELING UP WITH A
STONE BREAKER'S HAMMER IN HIS HAND
ONE OF THE CHIMNEY BUILDERS WHOSE SMIRCHED FACE WAS LIGHTED UP BY
THE CANDLE AND IN WHOM MARIUS RECOGNIZED IN SPITE OF HIS DAUBING
PANCHAUD ALIAS PRINTANIER ALIAS BIGRENAILLE LIFTED ABOVE M
LEBLANC'S
HEAD A SORT OF BLUDGEON MADE OF TWO BALLS OF LEAD AT THE TWO ENDS OF A
BAR OF IRON
MARIUS COULD NOT RESIST THIS SIGHT
MY FATHER HE THOUGHT FORGIVE
ME
AND HIS FINGER SOUGHT THE TRIGGER OF HIS PISTOL
THE SHOT WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING DISCHARGED WHEN THENARDIER'S VOICE
SHOUTED
DON'T HARM HIM
THIS DESPERATE ATTEMPT OF THE VICTIM FAR FROM EXASPERATING THENARDIER
HAD CALMED HIM
THERE EXISTED IN HIM TWO MEN THE FEROCIOUS MAN AND
THE ADROIT MAN
UP TO THAT MOMENT IN THE EXCESS OF HIS TRIUMPH IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE PREY WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT DOWN AND WHICH DID NOT
STIR THE FEROCIOUS MAN HAD PREVAILED WHEN THE VICTIM STRUGGLED AND
TRIED TO RESIST THE ADROIT MAN REAPPEARED AND TOOK THE UPPER HAND
DON'T HURT HIM HE REPEATED AND WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT HIS FIRST
SUCCESS WAS TO ARREST THE PISTOL IN THE ACT OF BEING DISCHARGED AND TO
PARALYZE MARIUS IN WHOSE OPINION THE URGENCY OF THE CASE DISAPPEARED
AND WHO IN THE FACE OF THIS NEW PHASE SAW NO INCONVENIENCE IN WAITING
A WHILE LONGER
WHO KNOWS WHETHER SOME CHANCE WOULD NOT ARISE WHICH WOULD DELIVER HIM
FROM THE HORRIBLE ALTERNATIVE OF ALLOWING URSULE'S FATHER TO PERISH OR
OF DESTROYING THE COLONEL'S SAVIOUR
A HERCULEAN STRUGGLE HAD BEGUN
WITH ONE BLOW FULL IN THE CHEST M
LEBLANC HAD SENT THE OLD MAN TUMBLING ROLLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
ROOM THEN WITH TWO BACKWARD SWEEPS OF HIS HAND HE HAD OVERTHROWN TWO
MORE ASSAILANTS AND HE HELD ONE UNDER EACH OF HIS KNEES THE WRETCHES
WERE RATTLING IN THE THROAT BENEATH THIS PRESSURE AS UNDER A GRANITE
MILLSTONE BUT THE OTHER FOUR HAD SEIZED THE FORMIDABLE OLD MAN BY BOTH
ARMS AND THE BACK OF HIS NECK AND WERE HOLDING HIM DOUBLED UP OVER THE
TWO CHIMNEY BUILDERS ON THE FLOOR
THUS THE MASTER OF SOME AND MASTERED BY THE REST CRUSHING THOSE
BENEATH HIM AND STIFLING UNDER THOSE ON TOP OF HIM ENDEAVORING IN VAIN
TO SHAKE OFF ALL THE EFFORTS WHICH WERE HEAPED UPON HIM M
LEBLANC
DISAPPEARED UNDER THE HORRIBLE GROUP OF RUFFIANS LIKE THE WILD BOAR
BENEATH A HOWLING PILE OF DOGS AND HOUNDS
THEY SUCCEEDED IN OVERTHROWING HIM UPON THE BED NEAREST THE WINDOW AND
THERE THEY HELD HIM IN AWE
THE THENARDIER WOMAN HAD NOT RELEASED HER
CLUTCH ON HIS HAIR
DON'T YOU MIX YOURSELF UP IN THIS AFFAIR SAID THENARDIER
YOU'LL
TEAR YOUR SHAWL
THE THENARDIER OBEYED AS THE FEMALE WOLF OBEYS THE MALE WOLF WITH A
GROWL
NOW SAID THENARDIER SEARCH HIM YOU OTHER FELLOWS
M
LEBLANC SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED THE IDEA OF RESISTANCE
THEY SEARCHED HIM
HE HAD NOTHING ON HIS PERSON EXCEPT A LEATHER PURSE CONTAINING SIX
FRANCS AND HIS HANDKERCHIEF
THENARDIER PUT THE HANDKERCHIEF INTO HIS OWN POCKET
WHAT NO POCKET BOOK HE DEMANDED
NO NOR WATCH REPLIED ONE OF THE CHIMNEY BUILDERS
NEVER MIND MURMURED THE MASKED MAN WHO CARRIED THE BIG KEY IN THE
VOICE OF A VENTRILOQUIST HE'S A TOUGH OLD FELLOW
THENARDIER WENT TO THE CORNER NEAR THE DOOR PICKED UP A BUNDLE OF ROPES
AND THREW THEM AT THE MEN
TIE HIM TO THE LEG OF THE BED SAID HE
AND CATCHING SIGHT OF THE OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN STRETCHED ACROSS THE
ROOM BY THE BLOW FROM M
LEBLANC'S FIST AND WHO MADE NO MOVEMENT HE
ADDED
IS BOULATRUELLE DEAD
NO REPLIED BIGRENAILLE HE'S DRUNK
SWEEP HIM INTO A CORNER SAID THENARDIER
TWO OF THE CHIMNEY BUILDERS PUSHED THE DRUNKEN MAN INTO THE CORNER
NEAR THE HEAP OF OLD IRON WITH THEIR FEET
BABET SAID THENARDIER IN A LOW TONE TO THE MAN WITH THE CUDGEL WHY
DID YOU BRING SO MANY THEY WERE NOT NEEDED
WHAT CAN YOU DO REPLIED THE MAN WITH THE CUDGEL THEY ALL WANTED TO
BE IN IT
THIS IS A BAD SEASON
THERE'S NO BUSINESS GOING ON
THE PALLET ON WHICH M
LEBLANC HAD BEEN THROWN WAS A SORT OF HOSPITAL
BED ELEVATED ON FOUR COARSE WOODEN LEGS ROUGHLY HEWN
M
LEBLANC LET THEM TAKE THEIR OWN COURSE
THE RUFFIANS BOUND HIM SECURELY IN AN UPRIGHT ATTITUDE WITH HIS FEET
ON THE GROUND AT THE HEAD OF THE BED THE END WHICH WAS MOST REMOTE FROM
THE WINDOW AND NEAREST TO THE FIREPLACE
WHEN THE LAST KNOT HAD BEEN TIED THENARDIER TOOK A CHAIR AND SEATED
HIMSELF ALMOST FACING M
LEBLANC
THENARDIER NO LONGER LOOKED LIKE HIMSELF IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MOMENTS
HIS FACE HAD PASSED FROM UNBRIDLED VIOLENCE TO TRANQUIL AND CUNNING
SWEETNESS
MARIUS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE IN THAT POLISHED SMILE OF A MAN
IN OFFICIAL LIFE THE ALMOST BESTIAL MOUTH WHICH HAD BEEN FOAMING BUT A
MOMENT BEFORE HE GAZED WITH AMAZEMENT ON THAT FANTASTIC AND ALARMING
METAMORPHOSIS AND HE FELT AS A MAN MIGHT FEEL WHO SHOULD BEHOLD A TIGER
CONVERTED INTO A LAWYER
MONSIEUR SAID THENARDIER
AND DISMISSING WITH A GESTURE THE RUFFIANS WHO STILL KEPT THEIR HANDS ON
M
LEBLANC
STAND OFF A LITTLE AND LET ME HAVE A TALK WITH THE GENTLEMAN
ALL RETIRED TOWARDS THE DOOR
HE WENT ON
MONSIEUR YOU DID WRONG TO TRY TO JUMP OUT OF THE WINDOW
YOU MIGHT
HAVE BROKEN YOUR LEG
NOW IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME WE WILL CONVERSE
QUIETLY
IN THE FIRST PLACE I MUST COMMUNICATE TO YOU AN OBSERVATION
WHICH I HAVE MADE WHICH IS THAT YOU HAVE NOT UTTERED THE FAINTEST CRY
THENARDIER WAS RIGHT THIS DETAIL WAS CORRECT ALTHOUGH IT HAD ESCAPED
MARIUS IN HIS AGITATION
M
LEBLANC HAD BARELY PRONOUNCED A FEW WORDS
WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE AND EVEN DURING HIS STRUGGLE WITH THE SIX
RUFFIANS NEAR THE WINDOW HE HAD PRESERVED THE MOST PROFOUND AND SINGULAR
SILENCE
THENARDIER CONTINUED
MON DIEU YOU MIGHT HAVE SHOUTED 'STOP THIEF' A BIT AND I SHOULD NOT
HAVE THOUGHT IT IMPROPER
'MURDER THAT TOO IS SAID OCCASIONALLY
AND SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN IT IN BAD PART
IT IS VERY NATURAL THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE ROW WHEN YOU FIND
YOURSELF WITH PERSONS WHO DON'T INSPIRE YOU WITH SUFFICIENT CONFIDENCE
YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE THAT AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE TROUBLED YOU ON THAT
ACCOUNT
YOU WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN GAGGED
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY
THIS ROOM IS VERY PRIVATE
THAT'S ITS ONLY RECOMMENDATION BUT IT HAS
THAT IN ITS FAVOR
YOU MIGHT FIRE OFF A MORTAR AND IT WOULD PRODUCE
ABOUT AS MUCH NOISE AT THE NEAREST POLICE STATION AS THE SNORES OF A
DRUNKEN MAN
HERE A CANNON WOULD MAKE A BOUM AND THE THUNDER WOULD MAKE
A POUF
IT'S A HANDY LODGING
BUT IN SHORT YOU DID NOT SHOUT AND
IT IS BETTER SO
I PRESENT YOU MY COMPLIMENTS AND I WILL TELL YOU THE
CONCLUSION THAT I DRAW FROM THAT FACT MY DEAR SIR WHEN A MAN SHOUTS
WHO COMES THE POLICE
AND AFTER THE POLICE JUSTICE
WELL YOU HAVE NOT
MADE AN OUTCRY THAT IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE TO HAVE THE POLICE AND
THE COURTS COME IN ANY MORE THAN WE DO
IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE LONG
SUSPECTED IT YOU HAVE SOME INTEREST IN HIDING SOMETHING
ON OUR SIDE
WE HAVE THE SAME INTEREST
SO WE CAN COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING
AS HE SPOKE THUS IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THENARDIER WHO KEPT HIS EYES
FIXED ON M
LEBLANC WERE TRYING TO PLUNGE THE SHARP POINTS WHICH DARTED
FROM THE PUPILS INTO THE VERY CONSCIENCE OF HIS PRISONER
MOREOVER HIS
LANGUAGE WHICH WAS STAMPED WITH A SORT OF MODERATED SUBDUED INSOLENCE
AND CRAFTY INSOLENCE WAS RESERVED AND ALMOST CHOICE AND IN THAT
RASCAL WHO HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT A ROBBER A SHORT TIME PREVIOUSLY ONE
NOW FELT THE MAN WHO HAD STUDIED FOR THE PRIESTHOOD
THE SILENCE PRESERVED BY THE PRISONER THAT PRECAUTION WHICH HAD BEEN
CARRIED TO THE POINT OF FORGETTING ALL ANXIETY FOR HIS OWN LIFE THAT
RESISTANCE OPPOSED TO THE FIRST IMPULSE OF NATURE WHICH IS TO UTTER
A CRY ALL THIS IT MUST BE CONFESSED NOW THAT HIS ATTENTION HAD
BEEN CALLED TO IT TROUBLED MARIUS AND AFFECTED HIM WITH PAINFUL
ASTONISHMENT
THENARDIER'S WELL GROUNDED OBSERVATION STILL FURTHER OBSCURED FOR MARIUS
THE DENSE MYSTERY WHICH ENVELOPED THAT GRAVE AND SINGULAR PERSON ON WHOM
COURFEYRAC HAD BESTOWED THE SOBRIQUET OF MONSIEUR LEBLANC
BUT WHOEVER HE WAS BOUND WITH ROPES SURROUNDED WITH EXECUTIONERS HALF
PLUNGED SO TO SPEAK IN A GRAVE WHICH WAS CLOSING IN UPON HIM TO THE
EXTENT OF A DEGREE WITH EVERY MOMENT THAT PASSED IN THE PRESENCE
OF THENARDIER'S WRATH AS IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS SWEETNESS THIS MAN
REMAINED IMPASSIVE AND MARIUS COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ADMIRING AT SUCH A
MOMENT THE SUPERBLY MELANCHOLY VISAGE
HERE EVIDENTLY WAS A SOUL WHICH WAS INACCESSIBLE TO TERROR AND WHICH
DID NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF DESPAIR
HERE WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO
COMMAND AMAZEMENT IN DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES
EXTREME AS WAS THE CRISIS
INEVITABLE AS WAS THE CATASTROPHE THERE WAS NOTHING HERE OF THE AGONY
OF THE DROWNING MAN WHO OPENS HIS HORROR FILLED EYES UNDER THE WATER
THENARDIER ROSE IN AN UNPRETENDING MANNER WENT TO THE FIREPLACE SHOVED
ASIDE THE SCREEN WHICH HE LEANED AGAINST THE NEIGHBORING PALLET AND
THUS UNMASKED THE BRAZIER FULL OF GLOWING COALS IN WHICH THE PRISONER
COULD PLAINLY SEE THE CHISEL WHITE HOT AND SPOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH
TINY SCARLET STARS
THEN THENARDIER RETURNED TO HIS SEAT BESIDE M
LEBLANC
I CONTINUE SAID HE
WE CAN COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING
LET US ARRANGE
THIS MATTER IN AN AMICABLE WAY
I WAS WRONG TO LOSE MY TEMPER JUST NOW
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING OF I WENT A GREAT DEAL TOO FAR I SAID
EXTRAVAGANT THINGS
FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE YOU ARE A MILLIONNAIRE I TOLD
YOU THAT I EXACTED MONEY A LOT OF MONEY A DEAL OF MONEY
THAT WOULD
NOT BE REASONABLE
MON DIEU IN SPITE OF YOUR RICHES YOU HAVE EXPENSES
OF YOUR OWN WHO HAS NOT I DON'T WANT TO RUIN YOU I AM NOT A GREEDY
FELLOW AFTER ALL
I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO BECAUSE THEY HAVE
THE ADVANTAGE OF THE POSITION PROFIT BY THE FACT TO MAKE THEMSELVES
RIDICULOUS
WHY I'M TAKING THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION AND MAKING A
SACRIFICE ON MY SIDE
I ONLY WANT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
M
LEBLANC UTTERED NOT A WORD
THENARDIER WENT ON
YOU SEE THAT I PUT NOT A LITTLE WATER IN MY WINE I'M VERY MODERATE
I
DON'T KNOW THE STATE OF YOUR FORTUNE BUT I DO KNOW THAT YOU DON'T STICK
AT MONEY AND A BENEVOLENT MAN LIKE YOURSELF CAN CERTAINLY GIVE TWO
HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS TO THE FATHER OF A FAMILY WHO IS OUT OF LUCK
CERTAINLY YOU ARE REASONABLE TOO YOU HAVEN'T IMAGINED THAT I SHOULD
TAKE ALL THE TROUBLE I HAVE TO DAY AND ORGANIZED THIS AFFAIR THIS
EVENING WHICH HAS BEEN LABOR WELL BESTOWED IN THE OPINION OF THESE
GENTLEMEN MERELY TO WIND UP BY ASKING YOU FOR ENOUGH TO GO AND DRINK
RED WINE AT FIFTEEN SOUS AND EAT VEAL AT DESNOYER'S
TWO HUNDRED
THOUSAND FRANCS IT'S SURELY WORTH ALL THAT
THIS TRIFLE ONCE OUT OF
YOUR POCKET I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THAT'S THE END OF THE MATTER AND THAT
YOU HAVE NO FURTHER DEMANDS TO FEAR
YOU WILL SAY TO ME 'BUT I HAVEN'T
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ABOUT ME OH I'M NOT EXTORTIONATE
I DON'T
DEMAND THAT
I ONLY ASK ONE THING OF YOU
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO WRITE
WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DICTATE TO YOU
HERE THENARDIER PAUSED THEN HE ADDED EMPHASIZING HIS WORDS AND
CASTING A SMILE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BRAZIER
I WARN YOU THAT I SHALL NOT ADMIT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE
A GRAND INQUISITOR MIGHT HAVE ENVIED THAT SMILE
THENARDIER PUSHED THE TABLE CLOSE TO M
LEBLANC AND TOOK AN INKSTAND
A PEN AND A SHEET OF PAPER FROM THE DRAWER WHICH HE LEFT HALF OPEN AND
IN WHICH GLEAMED THE LONG BLADE OF THE KNIFE
HE PLACED THE SHEET OF PAPER BEFORE M
LEBLANC
WRITE SAID HE
THE PRISONER SPOKE AT LAST
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WRITE I AM BOUND
THAT'S TRUE EXCUSE ME EJACULATED THENARDIER YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT
AND TURNING TO BIGRENAILLE
UNTIE THE GENTLEMAN'S RIGHT ARM
PANCHAUD ALIAS PRINTANIER ALIAS BIGRENAILLE EXECUTED THENARDIER'S
ORDER
WHEN THE PRISONER'S RIGHT ARM WAS FREE THENARDIER DIPPED THE PEN IN THE
INK AND PRESENTED IT TO HIM
UNDERSTAND THOROUGHLY SIR THAT YOU ARE IN OUR POWER AT OUR
DISCRETION THAT NO HUMAN POWER CAN GET YOU OUT OF THIS AND THAT WE
SHALL BE REALLY GRIEVED IF WE ARE FORCED TO PROCEED TO DISAGREEABLE
EXTREMITIES
I KNOW NEITHER YOUR NAME NOR YOUR ADDRESS BUT I WARN YOU
THAT YOU WILL REMAIN BOUND UNTIL THE PERSON CHARGED WITH CARRYING THE
LETTER WHICH YOU ARE ABOUT TO WRITE SHALL HAVE RETURNED
NOW BE SO GOOD
AS TO WRITE
WHAT DEMANDED THE PRISONER
I WILL DICTATE
M
LEBLANC TOOK THE PEN
THENARDIER BEGAN TO DICTATE
MY DAUGHTER
THE PRISONER SHUDDERED AND RAISED HIS EYES TO THENARDIER
PUT DOWN 'MY DEAR DAUGHTER' SAID THENARDIER
M
LEBLANC OBEYED
THENARDIER CONTINUED
COME INSTANTLY
HE PAUSED
YOU ADDRESS HER AS THOU DO YOU NOT
WHO ASKED M
LEBLANC
PARBLEU CRIED THENARDIER THE LITTLE ONE THE LARK
M
LEBLANC REPLIED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST APPARENT EMOTION
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
GO ON NEVERTHELESS EJACULATED THENARDIER AND HE CONTINUED TO
DICTATE
COME IMMEDIATELY I AM IN ABSOLUTE NEED OF THEE
THE PERSON WHO WILL
DELIVER THIS NOTE TO THEE IS INSTRUCTED TO CONDUCT THEE TO ME
I AM
WAITING FOR THEE
COME WITH CONFIDENCE
M
LEBLANC HAD WRITTEN THE WHOLE OF THIS
THENARDIER RESUMED
AH ERASE 'COME WITH CONFIDENCE' THAT MIGHT LEAD HER TO SUPPOSE THAT
EVERYTHING WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE AND THAT DISTRUST IS POSSIBLE
M
LEBLANC ERASED THE THREE WORDS
NOW PURSUED THENARDIER SIGN IT
WHAT'S YOUR NAME
THE PRISONER LAID DOWN THE PEN AND DEMANDED
FOR WHOM IS THIS LETTER
YOU KNOW WELL RETORTED THENARDIER FOR THE LITTLE ONE I JUST TOLD
YOU SO
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THENARDIER AVOIDED NAMING THE YOUNG GIRL IN
QUESTION
HE SAID THE LARK HE SAID THE LITTLE ONE BUT HE DID NOT
PRONOUNCE HER NAME THE PRECAUTION OF A CLEVER MAN GUARDING HIS SECRET
FROM HIS ACCOMPLICES
TO MENTION THE NAME WAS TO DELIVER THE WHOLE
AFFAIR INTO THEIR HANDS AND TO TELL THEM MORE ABOUT IT THAN THERE WAS
ANY NEED OF THEIR KNOWING
HE WENT ON
SIGN
WHAT IS YOUR NAME
URBAIN FABRE SAID THE PRISONER
THENARDIER WITH THE MOVEMENT OF A CAT DASHED HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET
AND DREW OUT THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH HAD BEEN SEIZED ON M
LEBLANC
HE
LOOKED FOR THE MARK ON IT AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THE CANDLE
U
F
THAT'S IT
URBAIN FABRE
WELL SIGN IT U
F
THE PRISONER SIGNED
AS TWO HANDS ARE REQUIRED TO FOLD THE LETTER GIVE IT TO ME I WILL
FOLD IT
THAT DONE THENARDIER RESUMED
ADDRESS IT 'MADEMOISELLE FABRE AT YOUR HOUSE
I KNOW THAT YOU LIVE
A LONG DISTANCE FROM HERE NEAR SAINT JACQUESDU HAUT PAS BECAUSE YOU GO
TO MASS THERE EVERY DAY BUT I DON'T KNOW IN WHAT STREET
I SEE THAT
YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR SITUATION
AS YOU HAVE NOT LIED ABOUT YOUR NAME YOU
WILL NOT LIE ABOUT YOUR ADDRESS
WRITE IT YOURSELF
THE PRISONER PAUSED THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MOMENT THEN HE TOOK THE PEN AND
WROTE
MADEMOISELLE FABRE AT M
URBAIN FABRE'S RUE SAINT DOMINIQUE D'ENFER
NO
17
THENARDIER SEIZED THE LETTER WITH A SORT OF FEVERISH CONVULSION
WIFE HE CRIED
THE THENARDIER WOMAN HASTENED TO HIM
HERE'S THE LETTER
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
THERE IS A CARRIAGE AT
THE DOOR
SET OUT AT ONCE AND RETURN DITTO
AND ADDRESSING THE MAN WITH THE MEAT AXE
SINCE YOU HAVE TAKEN OFF YOUR NOSE SCREEN ACCOMPANY THE MISTRESS
YOU
WILL GET UP BEHIND THE FIACRE
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU LEFT THE TEAM
YES SAID THE MAN
AND DEPOSITING HIS AXE IN A CORNER HE FOLLOWED MADAME THENARDIER
AS THEY SET OFF THENARDIER THRUST HIS HEAD THROUGH THE HALF OPEN DOOR
AND SHOUTED INTO THE CORRIDOR
ABOVE ALL THINGS DON'T LOSE THE LETTER REMEMBER THAT YOU CARRY TWO
HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WITH YOU
THE THENARDIER'S HOARSE VOICE REPLIED
BE EASY
I HAVE IT IN MY BOSOM
A MINUTE HAD NOT ELAPSED WHEN THE SOUND OF THE CRACKING OF A WHIP WAS
HEARD WHICH RAPIDLY RETREATED AND DIED AWAY
GOOD GROWLED THENARDIER
THEY'RE GOING AT A FINE PACE
AT SUCH A
GALLOP THE BOURGEOISE WILL BE BACK INSIDE THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR
HE DREW A CHAIR CLOSE TO THE FIREPLACE FOLDING HIS ARMS AND PRESENTING
HIS MUDDY BOOTS TO THE BRAZIER
MY FEET ARE COLD SAID HE
ONLY FIVE RUFFIANS NOW REMAINED IN THE DEN WITH THENARDIER AND THE
PRISONER
THESE MEN THROUGH THE BLACK MASKS OR PASTE WHICH COVERED THEIR FACES
AND MADE OF THEM AT FEAR'S PLEASURE CHARCOAL BURNERS NEGROES OR
DEMONS HAD A STUPID AND GLOOMY AIR AND IT COULD BE FELT THAT THEY
PERPETRATED A CRIME LIKE A BIT OF WORK TRANQUILLY WITHOUT EITHER WRATH
OR MERCY WITH A SORT OF ENNUI
THEY WERE CROWDED TOGETHER IN ONE CORNER
LIKE BRUTES AND REMAINED SILENT
THENARDIER WARMED HIS FEET
THE PRISONER HAD RELAPSED INTO HIS TACITURNITY
A SOMBRE CALM HAD
SUCCEEDED TO THE WILD UPROAR WHICH HAD FILLED THE GARRET BUT A FEW
MOMENTS BEFORE
THE CANDLE ON WHICH A LARGE STRANGER HAD FORMED CAST BUT A DIM
LIGHT IN THE IMMENSE HOVEL THE BRAZIER HAD GROWN DULL AND ALL THOSE
MONSTROUS HEADS CAST MISSHAPEN SHADOWS ON THE WALLS AND CEILING
NO SOUND WAS AUDIBLE EXCEPT THE QUIET BREATHING OF THE OLD DRUNKEN MAN
WHO WAS FAST ASLEEP
MARIUS WAITED IN A STATE OF ANXIETY THAT WAS AUGMENTED BY EVERY TRIFLE
THE ENIGMA WAS MORE IMPENETRABLE THAN EVER
WHO WAS THIS LITTLE ONE WHOM THENARDIER HAD CALLED THE LARK WAS SHE
HIS URSULE THE PRISONER HAD NOT SEEMED TO BE AFFECTED BY THAT WORD
THE LARK AND HAD REPLIED IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER IN THE WORLD
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN ON THE OTHER HAND THE TWO LETTERS U
F
WERE EXPLAINED THEY MEANT URBAIN FABRE AND URSULE WAS NO LONGER NAMED
URSULE
THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL
A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH
HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE
THERE HE STOOD
ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE
ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS
HE WAITED IN THE HOPE
OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE SINCE HE COULD NOT COLLECT
HIS THOUGHTS AND DID NOT KNOW UPON WHAT COURSE TO DECIDE
IN ANY CASE HE SAID IF SHE IS THE LARK I SHALL SEE HER FOR THE
THENARDIER WOMAN IS TO BRING HER HITHER
THAT WILL BE THE END AND THEN
I WILL GIVE MY LIFE AND MY BLOOD IF NECESSARY BUT I WILL DELIVER HER
NOTHING SHALL STOP ME
NEARLY HALF AN HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER
THENARDIER SEEMED TO BE
ABSORBED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR
STILL MARIUS
FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A
FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER
ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
BY THE WAY MONSIEUR FABRE I MIGHT AS WELL SAY IT TO YOU AT ONCE
THESE FEW WORDS APPEARED TO BE THE BEGINNING OF AN EXPLANATION
MARIUS
STRAINED HIS EARS
MY WIFE WILL BE BACK SHORTLY DON'T GET IMPATIENT
I THINK THAT THE
LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND IT SEEMS TO ME QUITE NATURAL THAT YOU
SHOULD KEEP HER
ONLY LISTEN TO ME A BIT
MY WIFE WILL GO AND HUNT HER
UP WITH YOUR LETTER
I TOLD MY WIFE TO DRESS HERSELF IN THE WAY SHE DID
SO THAT YOUR YOUNG LADY MIGHT MAKE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT FOLLOWING HER
THEY WILL BOTH ENTER THE CARRIAGE WITH MY COMRADE BEHIND
SOMEWHERE
OUTSIDE THE BARRIER THERE IS A TRAP HARNESSED TO TWO VERY GOOD HORSES
YOUR YOUNG LADY WILL BE TAKEN TO IT
SHE WILL ALIGHT FROM THE FIACRE
MY COMRADE WILL ENTER THE OTHER VEHICLE WITH HER AND MY WIFE WILL COME
BACK HERE TO TELL US 'IT'S DONE AS FOR THE YOUNG LADY NO HARM WILL
BE DONE TO HER THE TRAP WILL CONDUCT HER TO A PLACE WHERE SHE WILL BE
QUIET AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO
HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU
IF YOU HAVE ME
ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S
ALL
THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE
AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER
CONTINUED
IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE
THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH
THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
I'M TELLING YOU HOW THINGS STAND
I WARN
YOU SO THAT YOU MAY BE PREPARED
HE PAUSED THE PRISONER DID NOT BREAK THE SILENCE AND THENARDIER
RESUMED
AS SOON AS MY WIFE RETURNS AND SAYS TO ME 'THE LARK IS ON THE WAY WE
WILL RELEASE YOU AND YOU WILL BE FREE TO GO AND SLEEP AT HOME
YOU SEE
THAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE NOT EVIL
TERRIBLE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MARIUS' MIND
WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM
THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS
WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE
IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
MARIUS FELT HIS HEART STOP BEATING
WHAT WAS HE TO DO DISCHARGE THE PISTOL PLACE ALL THOSE SCOUNDRELS IN
THE HANDS OF JUSTICE BUT THE HORRIBLE MAN WITH THE MEAT AXE WOULD NONE
THE LESS BE OUT OF REACH WITH THE YOUNG GIRL AND MARIUS REFLECTED ON
THENARDIER'S WORDS OF WHICH HE PERCEIVED THE BLOODY SIGNIFICANCE IF
YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE
LARK
NOW IT WAS NOT ALONE BY THE COLONEL'S TESTAMENT IT WAS BY HIS OWN
LOVE IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF
RESTRAINED
THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR
WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
MARIUS HAD SUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF MIND TO REVIEW IN SUCCESSION ALL THE
MOST HEART BREAKING CONJECTURES SEEKING HOPE AND FINDING NONE
THE TUMULT OF HIS THOUGHTS CONTRASTED WITH THE FUNEREAL SILENCE OF THE
DEN
IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE
WAS HEARD TO OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN
THE PRISONER MADE A MOVEMENT IN HIS BONDS
HERE'S THE BOURGEOISE SAID THENARDIER
HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE THENARDIER WOMAN DID IN FACT
RUSH HASTILY INTO THE ROOM RED PANTING BREATHLESS WITH FLAMING EYES
AND CRIED AS SHE SMOTE HER HUGE HANDS ON HER THIGHS SIMULTANEOUSLY
FALSE ADDRESS
THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND
PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN
SHE RESUMED
NOBODY THERE RUE SAINT DOMINIQUE NO
17 NO MONSIEUR URBAIN FABRE
THEY KNOW NOT WHAT IT MEANS
SHE PAUSED CHOKING THEN WENT ON
MONSIEUR THENARDIER THAT OLD FELLOW HAS DUPED YOU YOU ARE TOO GOOD
YOU SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ME I'D HAVE CHOPPED THE BEAST IN FOUR QUARTERS
TO BEGIN WITH AND IF HE HAD ACTED UGLY I'D HAVE BOILED HIM ALIVE HE
WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND SAY WHERE THE GIRL IS AND WHERE
HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS
PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER
THAN WOMEN NOBODY AT NO
17
IT'S NOTHING BUT A BIG CARRIAGE GATE NO
MONSIEUR FABRE IN THE RUE SAINT DOMINIQUE AND AFTER ALL THAT RACING
AND FEE TO THE COACHMAN AND ALL I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PORTER AND THE
PORTRESS A FINE STOUT WOMAN AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM
MARIUS BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
SHE URSULE OR THE LARK HE NO LONGER KNEW WHAT TO CALL HER WAS SAFE
WHILE HIS EXASPERATED WIFE VOCIFERATED THENARDIER HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON
THE TABLE
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT
WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS
TONE
A FALSE ADDRESS WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO GAIN BY THAT
TO GAIN TIME CRIED THE PRISONER IN A THUNDERING VOICE AND AT THE
SAME INSTANT HE SHOOK OFF HIS BONDS THEY WERE CUT
THE PRISONER WAS
ONLY ATTACHED TO THE BED NOW BY ONE LEG
BEFORE THE SEVEN MEN HAD TIME TO COLLECT THEIR SENSES AND DASH FORWARD
HE HAD BENT DOWN INTO THE FIREPLACE HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO THE
BRAZIER AND HAD THEN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND NOW THENARDIER
THE FEMALE THENARDIER AND THE RUFFIANS HUDDLED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE
EXTREMITY OF THE HOVEL STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE
AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT
CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
THE JUDICIAL EXAMINATION TO WHICH THE AMBUSH IN THE GORBEAU HOUSE
EVENTUALLY GAVE RISE ESTABLISHED THE FACT THAT A LARGE SOU PIECE CUT
AND WORKED IN A PECULIAR FASHION WAS FOUND IN THE GARRET WHEN THE
POLICE MADE THEIR DESCENT ON IT
THIS SOU PIECE WAS ONE OF THOSE MARVELS
OF INDUSTRY WHICH ARE ENGENDERED BY THE PATIENCE OF THE GALLEYS IN
THE SHADOWS AND FOR THE SHADOWS MARVELS WHICH ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN
INSTRUMENTS OF ESCAPE
THESE HIDEOUS AND DELICATE PRODUCTS OF WONDERFUL
ART ARE TO JEWELLERS' WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY
THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS JUST AS THERE ARE VILLONS
IN LANGUAGE
THE UNHAPPY WRETCH WHO ASPIRES TO DELIVERANCE FINDS MEANS
SOMETIMES WITHOUT TOOLS SOMETIMES WITH A COMMON WOODEN HANDLED KNIFE
TO SAW A SOU INTO TWO THIN PLATES TO HOLLOW OUT THESE PLATES WITHOUT
AFFECTING THE COINAGE STAMP AND TO MAKE A FURROW ON THE EDGE OF THE SOU
IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE PLATES WILL ADHERE AGAIN
THIS CAN BE SCREWED
TOGETHER AND UNSCREWED AT WILL IT IS A BOX
IN THIS BOX HE HIDES A
WATCH SPRING AND THIS WATCH SPRING PROPERLY HANDLED CUTS GOOD SIZED
CHAINS AND BARS OF IRON
THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS
MERELY A SOU NOT AT ALL HE POSSESSES LIBERTY
IT WAS A LARGE SOU OF
THIS SORT WHICH DURING THE SUBSEQUENT SEARCH OF THE POLICE WAS FOUND
UNDER THE BED NEAR THE WINDOW
THEY ALSO FOUND A TINY SAW OF BLUE STEEL
WHICH WOULD FIT THE SOU
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRISONER HAD THIS SOU PIECE ON HIS PERSON AT THE
MOMENT WHEN THE RUFFIANS SEARCHED HIM THAT HE CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL
IT IN HIS HAND AND THAT AFTERWARD HAVING HIS RIGHT HAND FREE HE
UNSCREWED IT AND USED IT AS A SAW TO CUT THE CORDS WHICH FASTENED HIM
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN THE FAINT NOISE AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENTS
WHICH MARIUS HAD OBSERVED
AS HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEND DOWN FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIMSELF HE
HAD NOT CUT THE BONDS OF HIS LEFT LEG
THE RUFFIANS HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR FIRST SURPRISE
BE EASY SAID BIGRENAILLE TO THENARDIER
HE STILL HOLDS BY ONE LEG
AND HE CAN'T GET AWAY
I'LL ANSWER FOR THAT
I TIED THAT PAW FOR HIM
IN THE MEANWHILE THE PRISONER HAD BEGUN TO SPEAK
YOU ARE WRETCHES BUT MY LIFE IS NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE OF DEFENDING IT
WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SPEAK THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME WRITE
WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WRITE THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SAY WHAT I DO NOT
CHOOSE TO SAY
HE STRIPPED UP HIS LEFT SLEEVE AND ADDED
SEE HERE
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL
WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE ON HIS BARE FLESH
THE CRACKLING OF THE BURNING FLESH BECAME AUDIBLE AND THE ODOR PECULIAR
TO CHAMBERS OF TORTURE FILLED THE HOVEL
ILLUSTRATION RED HOT CHISEL 3B8 20 RED HOT CHISEL
MARIUS REELED IN UTTER HORROR THE VERY RUFFIANS SHUDDERED HARDLY A
MUSCLE OF THE OLD MAN'S FACE CONTRACTED AND WHILE THE RED HOT IRON
SANK INTO THE SMOKING WOUND IMPASSIVE AND ALMOST AUGUST HE FIXED ON
THENARDIER HIS BEAUTIFUL GLANCE IN WHICH THERE WAS NO HATRED AND WHERE
SUFFERING VANISHED IN SERENE MAJESTY
WITH GRAND AND LOFTY NATURES THE REVOLTS OF THE FLESH AND THE SENSES
WHEN SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING CAUSE THE SOUL TO SPRING FORTH AND
MAKE IT APPEAR ON THE BROW JUST AS REBELLIONS AMONG THE SOLDIERY FORCE
THE CAPTAIN TO SHOW HIMSELF
WRETCHES SAID HE HAVE NO MORE FEAR OF ME THAN I HAVE FOR YOU
AND TEARING THE CHISEL FROM THE WOUND HE HURLED IT THROUGH THE WINDOW
WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO
THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW
THE PRISONER RESUMED
DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
SEIZE HIM SAID THENARDIER
TWO OF THE RUFFIANS LAID THEIR HANDS ON HIS SHOULDER AND THE MASKED
MAN WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE TOOK UP HIS STATION IN FRONT OF HIM
READY TO SMASH HIS SKULL AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT
AT THE SAME TIME MARIUS HEARD BELOW HIM AT THE BASE OF THE PARTITION
BUT SO NEAR THAT HE COULD NOT SEE WHO WAS SPEAKING THIS COLLOQUY
CONDUCTED IN A LOW TONE
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO
CUT HIS THROAT
THAT'S IT
IT WAS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER
THENARDIER WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE OPENED THE DRAWER AND
TOOK OUT THE KNIFE
MARIUS FRETTED WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS PISTOL
UNPRECEDENTED PERPLEXITY FOR THE LAST HOUR HE HAD HAD TWO VOICES IN HIS
CONSCIENCE THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE
OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER
THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED
UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY
UP TO THAT
MOMENT HE HAD CHERISHED A VAGUE HOPE THAT HE SHOULD FIND SOME MEANS
OF RECONCILING THESE TWO DUTIES BUT NOTHING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF
POSSIBILITY HAD PRESENTED ITSELF
HOWEVER THE PERIL WAS URGENT THE LAST BOUNDS OF DELAY HAD BEEN
REACHED THENARDIER WAS STANDING THOUGHTFULLY A FEW PACES DISTANT FROM
THE PRISONER
MARIUS CAST A WILD GLANCE ABOUT HIM THE LAST MECHANICAL RESOURCE OF
DESPAIR
ALL AT ONCE A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH HIM
AT HIS FEET ON THE TABLE A BRIGHT RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE FULL MOON
ILLUMINATED AND SEEMED TO POINT OUT TO HIM A SHEET OF PAPER
ON THIS
PAPER HE READ THE FOLLOWING LINE WRITTEN THAT VERY MORNING IN LARGE
LETTERS BY THE ELDEST OF THE THENARDIER GIRLS
THE BOBBIES ARE HERE
AN IDEA A FLASH CROSSED MARIUS' MIND THIS WAS THE EXPEDIENT OF WHICH
HE WAS IN SEARCH THE SOLUTION OF THAT FRIGHTFUL PROBLEM WHICH WAS
TORTURING HIM OF SPARING THE ASSASSIN AND SAVING THE VICTIM
HE KNELT DOWN ON HIS COMMODE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARM SEIZED THE SHEET OF
PAPER SOFTLY DETACHED A BIT OF PLASTER FROM THE WALL WRAPPED THE PAPER
ROUND IT AND TOSSED THE WHOLE THROUGH THE CREVICE INTO THE MIDDLE OF
THE DEN
IT WAS HIGH TIME
THENARDIER HAD CONQUERED HIS LAST FEARS OR HIS LAST
SCRUPLES AND WAS ADVANCING ON THE PRISONER
SOMETHING IS FALLING CRIED THE THENARDIER WOMAN
WHAT IS IT ASKED HER HUSBAND
THE WOMAN DARTED FORWARD AND PICKED UP THE BIT OF PLASTER
SHE HANDED IT
TO HER HUSBAND
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER
PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM
THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
I SAW IT PASS SAID BIGRENAILLE
THENARDIER RAPIDLY UNFOLDED THE PAPER AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THE CANDLE
IT'S IN EPONINE'S HANDWRITING
THE DEVIL
HE MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE WHO HASTILY DREW NEAR AND SHOWED HER THE
LINE WRITTEN ON THE SHEET OF PAPER THEN HE ADDED IN A SUBDUED VOICE
QUICK THE LADDER LET'S LEAVE THE BACON IN THE MOUSETRAP AND DECAMP
WITHOUT CUTTING THAT MAN'S THROAT ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN
WE HAVEN'T THE TIME
THROUGH WHAT RESUMED BIGRENAILLE
THROUGH THE WINDOW REPLIED THENARDIER
SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE
STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON
THAT SIDE
THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE
FLOOR RAISED BOTH ARMS IN THE AIR AND OPENED AND CLENCHED HIS FISTS
THREE TIMES RAPIDLY WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD
THIS WAS THE SIGNAL LIKE THE SIGNAL FOR CLEARING THE DECKS FOR ACTION ON
BOARD SHIP
THE RUFFIANS WHO WERE HOLDING THE PRISONER RELEASED HIM IN THE
TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE ROPE LADDER WAS UNROLLED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND
SOLIDLY FASTENED TO THE SILL BY THE TWO IRON HOOKS
THE PRISONER PAID NO ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND HIM
HE
SEEMED TO BE DREAMING OR PRAYING
AS SOON AS THE LADDER WAS ARRANGED THENARDIER CRIED
COME THE BOURGEOISE FIRST
AND HE RUSHED HEADLONG TO THE WINDOW
BUT JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO THROW HIS LEG OVER BIGRENAILLE SEIZED HIM
ROUGHLY BY THE COLLAR
NOT MUCH COME NOW YOU OLD DOG AFTER US
AFTER US YELLED THE RUFFIANS
YOU ARE CHILDREN SAID THENARDIER WE ARE LOSING TIME
THE POLICE ARE
ON OUR HEELS
WELL SAID THE RUFFIANS LET'S DRAW LOTS TO SEE WHO SHALL GO DOWN
FIRST
THENARDIER EXCLAIMED
ARE YOU MAD ARE YOU CRAZY WHAT A PACK OF BOOBIES YOU WANT TO WASTE
TIME DO YOU DRAW LOTS DO YOU BY A WET FINGER BY A SHORT STRAW WITH
WRITTEN NAMES THROWN INTO A HAT
WOULD YOU LIKE MY HAT CRIED A VOICE ON THE THRESHOLD
ALL WHEELED ROUND
IT WAS JAVERT
HE HAD HIS HAT IN HIS HAND AND WAS HOLDING IT OUT TO THEM WITH A SMILE
CHAPTER XXI ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BEGIN BY ARRESTING THE VICTIMS
AT NIGHTFALL JAVERT HAD POSTED HIS MEN AND HAD GONE INTO AMBUSH HIMSELF
BETWEEN THE TREES OF THE RUE DE LA BARRIEREDES GOBELINS WHICH FACED
THE GORBEAU HOUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD
HE HAD BEGUN
OPERATIONS BY OPENING HIS POCKETS AND DROPPING INTO IT THE TWO YOUNG
GIRLS WHO WERE CHARGED WITH KEEPING A WATCH ON THE APPROACHES TO THE
DEN
BUT HE HAD ONLY CAGED AZELMA
AS FOR EPONINE SHE WAS NOT AT HER
POST SHE HAD DISAPPEARED AND HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEIZE HER
THEN
JAVERT HAD MADE A POINT AND HAD BENT HIS EAR TO WAITING FOR THE SIGNAL
AGREED UPON
THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF THE FIACRES HAD GREATLY AGITATED
HIM
AT LAST HE HAD GROWN IMPATIENT AND SURE THAT THERE WAS A NEST
THERE SURE OF BEING IN LUCK HAVING RECOGNIZED MANY OF THE RUFFIANS
WHO HAD ENTERED HE HAD FINALLY DECIDED TO GO UPSTAIRS WITHOUT WAITING
FOR THE PISTOL SHOT
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD MARIUS' PASS KEY
HE HAD ARRIVED JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME
THE TERRIFIED RUFFIANS FLUNG THEMSELVES ON THE ARMS WHICH THEY HAD
ABANDONED IN ALL THE CORNERS AT THE MOMENT OF FLIGHT
IN LESS THAN A
SECOND THESE SEVEN MEN HORRIBLE TO BEHOLD HAD GROUPED THEMSELVES IN
AN ATTITUDE OF DEFENCE ONE WITH HIS MEAT AXE ANOTHER WITH HIS KEY
ANOTHER WITH HIS BLUDGEON THE REST WITH SHEARS PINCERS AND HAMMERS
THENARDIER HAD HIS KNIFE IN HIS FIST
THE THENARDIER WOMAN SNATCHED UP
AN ENORMOUS PAVING STONE WHICH LAY IN THE ANGLE OF THE WINDOW AND SERVED
HER DAUGHTERS AS AN OTTOMAN
ILLUSTRATION SNATCHED UP A PAVING STONE 3B8 21 PAVING STONE
JAVERT PUT ON HIS HAT AGAIN AND ADVANCED A COUPLE OF PACES INTO THE
ROOM WITH ARMS FOLDED HIS CANE UNDER ONE ARM HIS SWORD IN ITS SHEATH
HALT THERE SAID HE
YOU SHALL NOT GO OUT BY THE WINDOW YOU SHALL GO
THROUGH THE DOOR
IT'S LESS UNHEALTHY
THERE ARE SEVEN OF YOU THERE
ARE FIFTEEN OF US
DON'T LET'S FALL TO COLLARING EACH OTHER LIKE MEN OF
AUVERGNE
BIGRENAILLE DREW OUT A PISTOL WHICH HE HAD KEPT CONCEALED UNDER HIS
BLOUSE AND PUT IT IN THENARDIER'S HAND WHISPERING IN THE LATTER'S
EAR
IT'S JAVERT
I DON'T DARE FIRE AT THAT MAN
DO YOU DARE
PARBLEU REPLIED THENARDIER
WELL THEN FIRE
THENARDIER TOOK THE PISTOL AND AIMED AT JAVERT
JAVERT WHO WAS ONLY THREE PACES FROM HIM STARED INTENTLY AT HIM AND
CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING
COME NOW DON'T FIRE
YOU'LL MISS FIRE
THENARDIER PULLED THE TRIGGER
THE PISTOL MISSED FIRE
DIDN'T I TELL YOU SO EJACULATED JAVERT
BIGRENAILLE FLUNG HIS BLUDGEON AT JAVERT'S FEET
YOU'RE THE EMPEROR OF THE FIENDS I SURRENDER
AND YOU JAVERT ASKED THE REST OF THE RUFFIANS
THEY REPLIED
SO DO WE
JAVERT BEGAN AGAIN CALMLY
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S GOOD I SAID SO YOU ARE NICE FELLOWS
I ONLY ASK ONE THING SAID BIGRENAILLE AND THAT IS THAT I MAY NOT
BE DENIED TOBACCO WHILE I AM IN CONFINEMENT
GRANTED SAID JAVERT
AND TURNING ROUND AND CALLING BEHIND HIM
COME IN NOW
A SQUAD OF POLICEMEN SWORD IN HAND AND AGENTS ARMED WITH BLUDGEONS AND
CUDGELS RUSHED IN AT JAVERT'S SUMMONS
THEY PINIONED THE RUFFIANS
THIS THRONG OF MEN SPARELY LIGHTED BY THE SINGLE CANDLE FILLED THE DEN
WITH SHADOWS
HANDCUFF THEM ALL SHOUTED JAVERT
COME ON CRIED A VOICE WHICH WAS NOT THE VOICE OF A MAN BUT OF WHICH
NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE SAID IT IS A WOMAN'S VOICE
THE THENARDIER WOMAN HAD ENTRENCHED HERSELF IN ONE OF THE ANGLES OF THE
WINDOW AND IT WAS SHE WHO HAD JUST GIVEN VENT TO THIS ROAR
THE POLICEMEN AND AGENTS RECOILED
SHE HAD THROWN OFF HER SHAWL BUT RETAINED HER BONNET HER HUSBAND WHO
WAS CROUCHING BEHIND HER WAS ALMOST HIDDEN UNDER THE DISCARDED
SHAWL AND SHE WAS SHIELDING HIM WITH HER BODY AS SHE ELEVATED THE
PAVING STONE ABOVE HER HEAD WITH THE GESTURE OF A GIANTESS ON THE POINT
OF HURLING A ROCK
BEWARE SHE SHOUTED
ALL CROWDED BACK TOWARDS THE CORRIDOR
A BROAD OPEN SPACE WAS CLEARED IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE GARRET
THE THENARDIER WOMAN CAST A GLANCE AT THE RUFFIANS WHO HAD ALLOWED
THEMSELVES TO BE PINIONED AND MUTTERED IN HOARSE AND GUTTURAL
ACCENTS
THE COWARDS
JAVERT SMILED AND ADVANCED ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE WHICH THE THENARDIER
WAS DEVOURING WITH HER EYES
DON'T COME NEAR ME SHE CRIED OR I'LL CRUSH YOU
WHAT A GRENADIER EJACULATED JAVERT YOU'VE GOT A BEARD LIKE A MAN
MOTHER BUT I HAVE CLAWS LIKE A WOMAN
AND HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE
THE THENARDIER DISHEVELLED AND TERRIBLE SET HER FEET FAR APART THREW
HERSELF BACKWARDS AND HURLED THE PAVING STONE AT JAVERT'S HEAD
JAVERT
DUCKED THE STONE PASSED OVER HIM STRUCK THE WALL BEHIND KNOCKED OFF A
HUGE PIECE OF PLASTERING AND REBOUNDING FROM ANGLE TO ANGLE ACROSS THE
HOVEL NOW LUCKILY ALMOST EMPTY RESTED AT JAVERT'S FEET
AT THE SAME MOMENT JAVERT REACHED THE THENARDIER COUPLE
ONE OF HIS
BIG HANDS DESCENDED ON THE WOMAN'S SHOULDER THE OTHER ON THE HUSBAND'S
HEAD
THE HANDCUFFS HE SHOUTED
THE POLICEMEN TROOPED IN IN FORCE AND IN A FEW SECONDS JAVERT'S ORDER
HAD BEEN EXECUTED
THE THENARDIER FEMALE OVERWHELMED STARED AT HER PINIONED HANDS AND
AT THOSE OF HER HUSBAND WHO HAD DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AND EXCLAIMED
WEEPING
MY DAUGHTERS
THEY ARE IN THE JUG SAID JAVERT
IN THE MEANWHILE THE AGENTS HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE DRUNKEN MAN ASLEEP
BEHIND THE DOOR AND WERE SHAKING HIM
HE AWOKE STAMMERING
IS IT ALL OVER JONDRETTE
YES REPLIED JAVERT
THE SIX PINIONED RUFFIANS WERE STANDING AND STILL PRESERVED THEIR
SPECTRAL MIEN ALL THREE BESMEARED WITH BLACK ALL THREE MASKED
KEEP ON YOUR MASKS SAID JAVERT
AND PASSING THEM IN REVIEW WITH A GLANCE OF A FREDERICK II
AT A POTSDAM
PARADE HE SAID TO THE THREE CHIMNEY BUILDERS
GOOD DAY BIGRENAILLE GOOD DAY BRUJON GOOD DAY DEUXMILLIARDS
THEN TURNING TO THE THREE MASKED MEN HE SAID TO THE MAN WITH THE
MEAT AXE
GOOD DAY GUEULEMER
AND TO THE MAN WITH THE CUDGEL
GOOD DAY BABET
AND TO THE VENTRILOQUIST
YOUR HEALTH CLAQUESOUS
AT THAT MOMENT HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RUFFIANS' PRISONER WHO EVER
SINCE THE ENTRANCE OF THE POLICE HAD NOT UTTERED A WORD AND HAD HELD
HIS HEAD DOWN
UNTIE THE GENTLEMAN SAID JAVERT AND LET NO ONE GO OUT
THAT SAID HE SEATED HIMSELF WITH SOVEREIGN DIGNITY BEFORE THE TABLE
WHERE THE CANDLE AND THE WRITING MATERIALS STILL REMAINED DREW A
STAMPED PAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND BEGAN TO PREPARE HIS REPORT
WHEN HE HAD WRITTEN THE FIRST LINES WHICH ARE FORMULAS THAT NEVER VARY
HE RAISED HIS EYES
LET THE GENTLEMAN WHOM THESE GENTLEMEN BOUND STEP FORWARD
THE POLICEMEN GLANCED ROUND THEM
WELL SAID JAVERT WHERE IS HE
THE PRISONER OF THE RUFFIANS M
LEBLANC M
URBAIN FABRE THE FATHER OF
URSULE OR THE LARK HAD DISAPPEARED
THE DOOR WAS GUARDED BUT THE WINDOW WAS NOT
AS SOON AS HE HAD FOUND
HIMSELF RELEASED FROM HIS BONDS AND WHILE JAVERT WAS DRAWING UP HIS
REPORT HE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF CONFUSION THE CROWD THE DARKNESS
AND OF A MOMENT WHEN THE GENERAL ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED FROM HIM TO
DASH OUT OF THE WINDOW
AN AGENT SPRANG TO THE OPENING AND LOOKED OUT
HE SAW NO ONE OUTSIDE
THE ROPE LADDER WAS STILL SHAKING
THE DEVIL EJACULATED JAVERT BETWEEN HIS TEETH HE MUST HAVE BEEN THE
MOST VALUABLE OF THE LOT
CHAPTER XXII THE LITTLE ONE WHO WAS CRYING IN VOLUME TWO
ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THAT ON WHICH THESE EVENTS TOOK PLACE IN THE HOUSE
ON THE BOULEVARD DE L'HOPITAL A CHILD WHO SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM THE
DIRECTION OF THE BRIDGE OF AUSTERLITZ WAS ASCENDING THE SIDE ALLEY ON
THE RIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BARRIERE DE FONTAINEBLEAU
NIGHT HAD FULLY COME
THIS LAD WAS PALE THIN CLAD IN RAGS WITH LINEN TROUSERS IN THE MONTH
OF FEBRUARY AND WAS SINGING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE
AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DU PETIT BANQUIER A BENT OLD WOMAN WAS
RUMMAGING IN A HEAP OF REFUSE BY THE LIGHT OF A STREET LANTERN THE
CHILD JOSTLED HER AS HE PASSED THEN RECOILED EXCLAIMING
HELLO AND I TOOK IT FOR AN ENORMOUS ENORMOUS DOG
HE PRONOUNCED THE WORD ENORMOUS THE SECOND TIME WITH A JEERING SWELL
OF THE VOICE WHICH MIGHT BE TOLERABLY WELL REPRESENTED BY CAPITALS AN
ENORMOUS ENORMOUS DOG
THE OLD WOMAN STRAIGHTENED HERSELF UP IN A FURY
NASTY BRAT SHE GRUMBLED
IF I HADN'T BEEN BENDING OVER I KNOW WELL
WHERE I WOULD HAVE PLANTED MY FOOT ON YOU
THE BOY WAS ALREADY FAR AWAY
KISSS KISSS HE CRIED
AFTER THAT I DON'T THINK I WAS MISTAKEN
THE OLD WOMAN CHOKING WITH INDIGNATION NOW ROSE COMPLETELY UPRIGHT
AND THE RED GLEAM OF THE LANTERN FULLY LIGHTED UP HER LIVID FACE ALL
HOLLOWED INTO ANGLES AND WRINKLES WITH CROW'S FEET MEETING THE CORNERS
OF HER MOUTH
HER BODY WAS LOST IN THE DARKNESS AND ONLY HER HEAD WAS VISIBLE
ONE
WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HER A MASK OF DECREPITUDE CARVED OUT BY A LIGHT
FROM THE NIGHT
THE BOY SURVEYED HER
MADAME SAID HE DOES NOT POSSESS THAT STYLE OF BEAUTY WHICH PLEASES
ME
HE THEN PURSUED HIS ROAD AND RESUMED HIS SONG
LE ROI COUPDESABOT
S'EN ALLAIT A LA CHASSE
A LA CHASSE AUX CORBEAUX
AT THE END OF THESE THREE LINES HE PAUSED
HE HAD ARRIVED IN FRONT OF
NO
50 52 AND FINDING THE DOOR FASTENED HE BEGAN TO ASSAULT IT WITH
RESOUNDING AND HEROIC KICKS WHICH BETRAYED RATHER THE MAN'S SHOES THAT
HE WAS WEARING THAN THE CHILD'S FEET WHICH HE OWNED
IN THE MEANWHILE THE VERY OLD WOMAN WHOM HE HAD ENCOUNTERED AT THE
CORNER OF THE RUE DU PETIT BANQUIER HASTENED UP BEHIND HIM UTTERING
CLAMOROUS CRIES AND INDULGING IN LAVISH AND EXAGGERATED GESTURES
WHAT'S THIS WHAT'S THIS LORD GOD HE'S BATTERING THE DOOR DOWN HE'S
KNOCKING THE HOUSE DOWN
THE KICKS CONTINUED
THE OLD WOMAN STRAINED HER LUNGS
IS THAT THE WAY BUILDINGS ARE TREATED NOWADAYS
ALL AT ONCE SHE PAUSED
SHE HAD RECOGNIZED THE GAMIN
WHAT SO IT'S THAT IMP
WHY IT'S THE OLD LADY SAID THE LAD
GOOD DAY BOUGONMUCHE
I HAVE
COME TO SEE MY ANCESTORS
THE OLD WOMAN RETORTED WITH A COMPOSITE GRIMACE AND A WONDERFUL
IMPROVISATION OF HATRED TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FEEBLENESS AND UGLINESS
WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY WASTED IN THE DARK
THERE'S NO ONE HERE
BAH RETORTED THE BOY WHERE'S MY FATHER
AT LA FORCE
COME NOW AND MY MOTHER
AT SAINT LAZARE
WELL AND MY SISTERS
AT THE MADELONETTES
THE LAD SCRATCHED HIS HEAD BEHIND HIS EAR STARED AT MA'AM BOUGON AND
SAID
AH
THEN HE EXECUTED A PIROUETTE ON HIS HEEL A MOMENT LATER THE OLD WOMAN
WHO HAD REMAINED ON THE DOOR STEP HEARD HIM SINGING IN HIS CLEAR YOUNG
VOICE AS HE PLUNGED UNDER THE BLACK ELM TREES IN THE WINTRY WIND

BOOK FIRST A FEW PAGES OF HISTORY
CHAPTER I WELL CUT
1831 AND 1832 THE TWO YEARS WHICH ARE IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED WITH THE
REVOLUTION OF JULY FORM ONE OF THE MOST PECULIAR AND STRIKING MOMENTS
OF HISTORY
THESE TWO YEARS RISE LIKE TWO MOUNTAINS MIDWAY BETWEEN THOSE
WHICH PRECEDE AND THOSE WHICH FOLLOW THEM
THEY HAVE A REVOLUTIONARY
GRANDEUR
PRECIPICES ARE TO BE DISTINGUISHED THERE
THE SOCIAL MASSES
THE VERY ASSIZES OF CIVILIZATION THE SOLID GROUP OF SUPERPOSED AND
ADHERING INTERESTS THE CENTURY OLD PROFILES OF THE ANCIENT FRENCH
FORMATION APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR IN THEM EVERY INSTANT ATHWART THE STORM
CLOUDS OF SYSTEMS OF PASSIONS AND OF THEORIES
THESE APPEARANCES
AND DISAPPEARANCES HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS MOVEMENT AND RESISTANCE
AT INTERVALS TRUTH THAT DAYLIGHT OF THE HUMAN SOUL CAN BE DESCRIED
SHINING THERE
THIS REMARKABLE EPOCH IS DECIDEDLY CIRCUMSCRIBED AND IS BEGINNING TO
BE SUFFICIENTLY DISTANT FROM US TO ALLOW OF OUR GRASPING THE PRINCIPAL
LINES EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY
WE SHALL MAKE THE ATTEMPT
THE RESTORATION HAD BEEN ONE OF THOSE INTERMEDIATE PHASES HARD TO
DEFINE IN WHICH THERE IS FATIGUE BUZZING MURMURS SLEEP TUMULT
AND WHICH ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN THE ARRIVAL OF A GREAT NATION AT A
HALTING PLACE
THESE EPOCHS ARE PECULIAR AND MISLEAD THE POLITICIANS WHO DESIRE TO
CONVERT THEM TO PROFIT
IN THE BEGINNING THE NATION ASKS NOTHING BUT
REPOSE IT THIRSTS FOR BUT ONE THING PEACE IT HAS BUT ONE AMBITION
TO BE SMALL
WHICH IS THE TRANSLATION OF REMAINING TRANQUIL
OF GREAT
EVENTS GREAT HAZARDS GREAT ADVENTURES GREAT MEN THANK GOD WE
HAVE SEEN ENOUGH WE HAVE THEM HEAPED HIGHER THAN OUR HEADS
WE WOULD
EXCHANGE CAESAR FOR PRUSIAS AND NAPOLEON FOR THE KING OF YVETOT
WHAT
A GOOD LITTLE KING WAS HE WE HAVE MARCHED SINCE DAYBREAK WE HAVE
REACHED THE EVENING OF A LONG AND TOILSOME DAY WE HAVE MADE OUR FIRST
CHANGE WITH MIRABEAU THE SECOND WITH ROBESPIERRE THE THIRD WITH
BONAPARTE WE ARE WORN OUT
EACH ONE DEMANDS A BED
DEVOTION WHICH IS WEARY HEROISM WHICH HAS GROWN OLD AMBITIONS WHICH
ARE SATED FORTUNES WHICH ARE MADE SEEK DEMAND IMPLORE SOLICIT
WHAT A SHELTER
THEY HAVE IT
THEY TAKE POSSESSION OF PEACE OF
TRANQUILLITY OF LEISURE BEHOLD THEY ARE CONTENT
BUT AT THE SAME
TIME CERTAIN FACTS ARISE COMPEL RECOGNITION AND KNOCK AT THE DOOR IN
THEIR TURN
THESE FACTS ARE THE PRODUCTS OF REVOLUTIONS AND WARS THEY
ARE THEY EXIST THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO INSTALL THEMSELVES IN SOCIETY
AND THEY DO INSTALL THEMSELVES THEREIN AND MOST OF THE TIME FACTS
ARE THE STEWARDS OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND FOURIERS 32 WHO DO NOTHING BUT
PREPARE LODGINGS FOR PRINCIPLES
THIS THEN IS WHAT APPEARS TO PHILOSOPHICAL POLITICIANS
AT THE SAME TIME THAT WEARY MEN DEMAND REPOSE ACCOMPLISHED FACTS DEMAND
GUARANTEES
GUARANTEES ARE THE SAME TO FACTS THAT REPOSE IS TO MEN
THIS IS WHAT ENGLAND DEMANDED OF THE STUARTS AFTER THE PROTECTOR THIS
IS WHAT FRANCE DEMANDED OF THE BOURBONS AFTER THE EMPIRE
THESE GUARANTEES ARE A NECESSITY OF THE TIMES
THEY MUST BE ACCORDED
PRINCES GRANT THEM BUT IN REALITY IT IS THE FORCE OF THINGS WHICH
GIVES THEM
A PROFOUND TRUTH AND ONE USEFUL TO KNOW WHICH THE STUARTS
DID NOT SUSPECT IN 1662 AND WHICH THE BOURBONS DID NOT EVEN OBTAIN A
GLIMPSE OF IN 1814
THE PREDESTINED FAMILY WHICH RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN NAPOLEON FELL HAD
THE FATAL SIMPLICITY TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ITSELF WHICH BESTOWED AND
THAT WHAT IT HAD BESTOWED IT COULD TAKE BACK AGAIN THAT THE HOUSE OF
BOURBON POSSESSED THE RIGHT DIVINE THAT FRANCE POSSESSED NOTHING AND
THAT THE POLITICAL RIGHT CONCEDED IN THE CHARTER OF LOUIS XVIII
WAS
MERELY A BRANCH OF THE RIGHT DIVINE WAS DETACHED BY THE HOUSE OF
BOURBON AND GRACIOUSLY GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE UNTIL SUCH DAY AS IT SHOULD
PLEASE THE KING TO REASSUME IT
STILL THE HOUSE OF BOURBON SHOULD HAVE
FELT FROM THE DISPLEASURE CREATED BY THE GIFT THAT IT DID NOT COME
FROM IT
THIS HOUSE WAS CHURLISH TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
IT PUT ON AN
ILL TEMPERED LOOK AT EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATION
TO MAKE USE OF A
TRIVIAL WORD THAT IS TO SAY OF A POPULAR AND A TRUE WORD IT LOOKED
GLUM
THE PEOPLE SAW THIS
IT THOUGHT IT POSSESSED STRENGTH BECAUSE THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN CARRIED
AWAY BEFORE IT LIKE A THEATRICAL STAGE SETTING
IT DID NOT PERCEIVE THAT
IT HAD ITSELF BEEN BROUGHT IN IN THE SAME FASHION
IT DID NOT PERCEIVE
THAT IT ALSO LAY IN THAT HAND WHICH HAD REMOVED NAPOLEON
IT THOUGHT THAT IT HAD ROOTS BECAUSE IT WAS THE PAST
IT WAS MISTAKEN
IT FORMED A PART OF THE PAST BUT THE WHOLE PAST WAS FRANCE
THE ROOTS
OF FRENCH SOCIETY WERE NOT FIXED IN THE BOURBONS BUT IN THE NATIONS
THESE OBSCURE AND LIVELY ROOTS CONSTITUTED NOT THE RIGHT OF A FAMILY
BUT THE HISTORY OF A PEOPLE
THEY WERE EVERYWHERE EXCEPT UNDER THE
THRONE
THE HOUSE OF BOURBON WAS TO FRANCE THE ILLUSTRIOUS AND BLEEDING KNOT IN
HER HISTORY BUT WAS NO LONGER THE PRINCIPAL ELEMENT OF HER DESTINY
AND THE NECESSARY BASE OF HER POLITICS
SHE COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT THE
BOURBONS SHE HAD DONE WITHOUT THEM FOR TWO AND TWENTY YEARS THERE
HAD BEEN A BREAK OF CONTINUITY THEY DID NOT SUSPECT THE FACT
AND HOW
SHOULD THEY HAVE SUSPECTED IT THEY WHO FANCIED THAT LOUIS XVII
REIGNED
ON THE 9TH OF THERMIDOR AND THAT LOUIS XVIII
WAS REIGNING AT THE
BATTLE OF MARENGO NEVER SINCE THE ORIGIN OF HISTORY HAD PRINCES BEEN
SO BLIND IN THE PRESENCE OF FACTS AND THE PORTION OF DIVINE AUTHORITY
WHICH FACTS CONTAIN AND PROMULGATE
NEVER HAD THAT PRETENSION HERE BELOW
WHICH IS CALLED THE RIGHT OF KINGS DENIED TO SUCH A POINT THE RIGHT FROM
ON HIGH
A CAPITAL ERROR WHICH LED THIS FAMILY TO LAY ITS HAND ONCE MORE ON THE
GUARANTEES GRANTED IN 1814 ON THE CONCESSIONS AS IT TERMED THEM
SAD
A SAD THING WHAT IT TERMED ITS CONCESSIONS WERE OUR CONQUESTS
WHAT IT TERMED OUR ENCROACHMENTS WERE OUR RIGHTS
WHEN THE HOUR SEEMED TO IT TO HAVE COME THE RESTORATION SUPPOSING
ITSELF VICTORIOUS OVER BONAPARTE AND WELL ROOTED IN THE COUNTRY THAT IS
TO SAY BELIEVING ITSELF TO BE STRONG AND DEEP ABRUPTLY DECIDED ON ITS
PLAN OF ACTION AND RISKED ITS STROKE
ONE MORNING IT DREW ITSELF UP
BEFORE THE FACE OF FRANCE AND ELEVATING ITS VOICE IT CONTESTED THE
COLLECTIVE TITLE AND THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT OF THE NATION TO SOVEREIGNTY
OF THE CITIZEN TO LIBERTY
IN OTHER WORDS IT DENIED TO THE NATION
THAT WHICH MADE IT A NATION AND TO THE CITIZEN THAT WHICH MADE HIM A
CITIZEN
THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF THOSE FAMOUS ACTS WHICH ARE CALLED THE
ORDINANCES OF JULY
THE RESTORATION FELL
IT FELL JUSTLY
BUT WE ADMIT IT HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY HOSTILE TO
ALL FORMS OF PROGRESS
GREAT THINGS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH IT
ALONGSIDE
UNDER THE RESTORATION THE NATION HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO CALM
DISCUSSION WHICH HAD BEEN LACKING UNDER THE REPUBLIC AND TO GRANDEUR
IN PEACE WHICH HAD BEEN WANTING UNDER THE EMPIRE
FRANCE FREE AND
STRONG HAD OFFERED AN ENCOURAGING SPECTACLE TO THE OTHER PEOPLES OF
EUROPE
THE REVOLUTION HAD HAD THE WORD UNDER ROBESPIERRE THE CANNON
HAD HAD THE WORD UNDER BONAPARTE IT WAS UNDER LOUIS XVIII
AND CHARLES
X
THAT IT WAS THE TURN OF INTELLIGENCE TO HAVE THE WORD
THE WIND
CEASED THE TORCH WAS LIGHTED ONCE MORE
ON THE LOFTY HEIGHTS THE
PURE LIGHT OF MIND COULD BE SEEN FLICKERING
A MAGNIFICENT USEFUL AND
CHARMING SPECTACLE
FOR A SPACE OF FIFTEEN YEARS THOSE GREAT PRINCIPLES
WHICH ARE SO OLD FOR THE THINKER SO NEW FOR THE STATESMAN COULD BE
SEEN AT WORK IN PERFECT PEACE ON THE PUBLIC SQUARE EQUALITY BEFORE THE
LAW LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE LIBERTY OF SPEECH LIBERTY OF THE PRESS THE
ACCESSIBILITY OF ALL APTITUDES TO ALL FUNCTIONS
THUS IT PROCEEDED UNTIL
1830
THE BOURBONS WERE AN INSTRUMENT OF CIVILIZATION WHICH BROKE IN THE
HANDS OF PROVIDENCE
THE FALL OF THE BOURBONS WAS FULL OF GRANDEUR NOT ON THEIR SIDE BUT
ON THE SIDE OF THE NATION
THEY QUITTED THE THRONE WITH GRAVITY BUT
WITHOUT AUTHORITY THEIR DESCENT INTO THE NIGHT WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE
SOLEMN DISAPPEARANCES WHICH LEAVE A SOMBRE EMOTION IN HISTORY IT
WAS NEITHER THE SPECTRAL CALM OF CHARLES I NOR THE EAGLE SCREAM OF
NAPOLEON
THEY DEPARTED THAT IS ALL
THEY LAID DOWN THE CROWN AND
RETAINED NO AUREOLE
THEY WERE WORTHY BUT THEY WERE NOT AUGUST
THEY
LACKED IN A CERTAIN MEASURE THE MAJESTY OF THEIR MISFORTUNE
CHARLES
X
DURING THE VOYAGE FROM CHERBOURG CAUSING A ROUND TABLE TO BE CUT
OVER INTO A SQUARE TABLE APPEARED TO BE MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT IMPERILLED
ETIQUETTE THAN ABOUT THE CRUMBLING MONARCHY
THIS DIMINUTION SADDENED
DEVOTED MEN WHO LOVED THEIR PERSONS AND SERIOUS MEN WHO HONORED THEIR
RACE
THE POPULACE WAS ADMIRABLE
THE NATION ATTACKED ONE MORNING WITH
WEAPONS BY A SORT OF ROYAL INSURRECTION FELT ITSELF IN THE POSSESSION
OF SO MUCH FORCE THAT IT DID NOT GO INTO A RAGE
IT DEFENDED ITSELF
RESTRAINED ITSELF RESTORED THINGS TO THEIR PLACES THE GOVERNMENT TO
LAW THE BOURBONS TO EXILE ALAS AND THEN HALTED IT TOOK THE OLD KING
CHARLES X
FROM BENEATH THAT DAIS WHICH HAD SHELTERED LOUIS XIV
AND
SET HIM GENTLY ON THE GROUND
IT TOUCHED THE ROYAL PERSONAGES ONLY WITH
SADNESS AND PRECAUTION
IT WAS NOT ONE MAN IT WAS NOT A FEW MEN IT
WAS FRANCE FRANCE ENTIRE FRANCE VICTORIOUS AND INTOXICATED WITH HER
VICTORY WHO SEEMED TO BE COMING TO HERSELF AND WHO PUT INTO PRACTICE
BEFORE THE EYES OF THE WHOLE WORLD THESE GRAVE WORDS OF GUILLAUME DU
VAIR AFTER THE DAY OF THE BARRICADES
IT IS EASY FOR THOSE WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SKIM THE FAVORS OF THE
GREAT AND TO SPRING LIKE A BIRD FROM BOUGH TO BOUGH FROM AN AFFLICTED
FORTUNE TO A FLOURISHING ONE TO SHOW THEMSELVES HARSH TOWARDS THEIR
PRINCE IN HIS ADVERSITY BUT AS FOR ME THE FORTUNE OF MY KINGS AND
ESPECIALLY OF MY AFFLICTED KINGS WILL ALWAYS BE VENERABLE TO ME
THE BOURBONS CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM RESPECT BUT NOT REGRET
AS WE HAVE
JUST STATED THEIR MISFORTUNE WAS GREATER THAN THEY WERE
THEY FADED OUT
IN THE HORIZON
THE REVOLUTION OF JULY INSTANTLY HAD FRIENDS AND ENEMIES THROUGHOUT THE
ENTIRE WORLD
THE FIRST RUSHED TOWARD HER WITH JOY AND ENTHUSIASM THE
OTHERS TURNED AWAY EACH ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE
AT THE FIRST BLUSH
THE PRINCES OF EUROPE THE OWLS OF THIS DAWN SHUT THEIR EYES WOUNDED
AND STUPEFIED AND ONLY OPENED THEM TO THREATEN
A FRIGHT WHICH CAN BE
COMPREHENDED A WRATH WHICH CAN BE PARDONED
THIS STRANGE REVOLUTION HAD
HARDLY PRODUCED A SHOCK IT HAD NOT EVEN PAID TO VANQUISHED ROYALTY THE
HONOR OF TREATING IT AS AN ENEMY AND OF SHEDDING ITS BLOOD
IN THE EYES
OF DESPOTIC GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE ALWAYS INTERESTED IN HAVING LIBERTY
CALUMNIATE ITSELF THE REVOLUTION OF JULY COMMITTED THE FAULT OF BEING
FORMIDABLE AND OF REMAINING GENTLE
NOTHING HOWEVER WAS ATTEMPTED OR
PLOTTED AGAINST IT
THE MOST DISCONTENTED THE MOST IRRITATED THE MOST
TREMBLING SALUTED IT WHATEVER OUR EGOTISM AND OUR RANCOR MAY BE A
MYSTERIOUS RESPECT SPRINGS FROM EVENTS IN WHICH WE ARE SENSIBLE OF THE
COLLABORATION OF SOME ONE WHO IS WORKING ABOVE MAN
THE REVOLUTION OF JULY IS THE TRIUMPH OF RIGHT OVERTHROWING THE FACT
A
THING WHICH IS FULL OF SPLENDOR
RIGHT OVERTHROWING THE FACT
HENCE THE BRILLIANCY OF THE REVOLUTION OF
1830 HENCE ALSO ITS MILDNESS
RIGHT TRIUMPHANT HAS NO NEED OF BEING
VIOLENT
RIGHT IS THE JUST AND THE TRUE
THE PROPERTY OF RIGHT IS TO REMAIN ETERNALLY BEAUTIFUL AND PURE
THE
FACT EVEN WHEN MOST NECESSARY TO ALL APPEARANCES EVEN WHEN MOST
THOROUGHLY ACCEPTED BY CONTEMPORARIES IF IT EXIST ONLY AS A FACT AND
IF IT CONTAIN ONLY TOO LITTLE OF RIGHT OR NONE AT ALL IS INFALLIBLY
DESTINED TO BECOME IN THE COURSE OF TIME DEFORMED IMPURE PERHAPS
EVEN MONSTROUS
IF ONE DESIRES TO LEARN AT ONE BLOW TO WHAT DEGREE OF
HIDEOUSNESS THE FACT CAN ATTAIN VIEWED AT THE DISTANCE OF CENTURIES
LET HIM LOOK AT MACHIAVELLI
MACHIAVELLI IS NOT AN EVIL GENIUS NOR A
DEMON NOR A MISERABLE AND COWARDLY WRITER HE IS NOTHING BUT THE FACT
AND HE IS NOT ONLY THE ITALIAN FACT HE IS THE EUROPEAN FACT THE
FACT OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
HE SEEMS HIDEOUS AND SO HE IS IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE MORAL IDEA OF THE NINETEENTH
THIS CONFLICT OF RIGHT AND FACT HAS BEEN GOING ON EVER SINCE THE ORIGIN
OF SOCIETY
TO TERMINATE THIS DUEL TO AMALGAMATE THE PURE IDEA WITH THE
HUMANE REALITY TO CAUSE RIGHT TO PENETRATE PACIFICALLY INTO THE FACT
AND THE FACT INTO RIGHT THAT IS THE TASK OF SAGES
CHAPTER II BADLY SEWED
BUT THE TASK OF SAGES IS ONE THING THE TASK OF CLEVER MEN IS ANOTHER
THE REVOLUTION OF 1830 CAME TO A SUDDEN HALT
AS SOON AS A REVOLUTION HAS MADE THE COAST THE SKILFUL MAKE HASTE TO
PREPARE THE SHIPWRECK
THE SKILFUL IN OUR CENTURY HAVE CONFERRED ON THEMSELVES THE TITLE OF
STATESMEN SO THAT THIS WORD STATESMEN HAS ENDED BY BECOMING SOMEWHAT
OF A SLANG WORD
IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND IN FACT THAT WHEREVER
THERE IS NOTHING BUT SKILL THERE IS NECESSARILY PETTINESS
TO SAY THE
SKILFUL AMOUNTS TO SAYING THE MEDIOCRE
IN THE SAME WAY TO SAY STATESMEN IS SOMETIMES EQUIVALENT TO SAYING
TRAITORS IF THEN WE ARE TO BELIEVE THE SKILFUL REVOLUTIONS LIKE
THE REVOLUTION OF JULY ARE SEVERED ARTERIES A PROMPT LIGATURE IS
INDISPENSABLE
THE RIGHT TOO GRANDLY PROCLAIMED IS SHAKEN
ALSO RIGHT
ONCE FIRMLY FIXED THE STATE MUST BE STRENGTHENED
LIBERTY ONCE ASSURED
ATTENTION MUST BE DIRECTED TO POWER
HERE THE SAGES ARE NOT AS YET SEPARATED FROM THE SKILFUL BUT THEY
BEGIN TO BE DISTRUSTFUL
POWER VERY GOOD
BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT
IS POWER IN THE SECOND WHENCE COMES IT THE SKILFUL DO NOT SEEM TO
HEAR THE MURMURED OBJECTION AND THEY CONTINUE THEIR MANOEUVRES
ACCORDING TO THE POLITICIANS WHO ARE INGENIOUS IN PUTTING THE MASK
OF NECESSITY ON PROFITABLE FICTIONS THE FIRST REQUIREMENT OF A PEOPLE
AFTER A REVOLUTION WHEN THIS PEOPLE FORMS PART OF A MONARCHICAL
CONTINENT IS TO PROCURE FOR ITSELF A DYNASTY
IN THIS WAY SAY THEY
PEACE THAT IS TO SAY TIME TO DRESS OUR WOUNDS AND TO REPAIR
THE HOUSE CAN BE HAD AFTER A REVOLUTION
THE DYNASTY CONCEALS THE
SCAFFOLDING AND COVERS THE AMBULANCE
NOW IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO
PROCURE A DYNASTY
IF IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THE FIRST MAN OF GENIUS OR EVEN THE FIRST
MAN OF FORTUNE WHO COMES TO HAND SUFFICES FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF A
KING
YOU HAVE IN THE FIRST CASE NAPOLEON IN THE SECOND ITURBIDE
BUT THE FIRST FAMILY THAT COMES TO HAND DOES NOT SUFFICE TO MAKE A
DYNASTY
THERE IS NECESSARILY REQUIRED A CERTAIN MODICUM OF ANTIQUITY IN
A RACE AND THE WRINKLE OF THE CENTURIES CANNOT BE IMPROVISED
IF WE PLACE OURSELVES AT THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE STATESMEN AFTER
MAKING ALL ALLOWANCES OF COURSE AFTER A REVOLUTION WHAT ARE THE
QUALITIES OF THE KING WHICH RESULT FROM IT HE MAY BE AND IT IS USEFUL
FOR HIM TO BE A REVOLUTIONARY THAT IS TO SAY A PARTICIPANT IN HIS OWN
PERSON IN THAT REVOLUTION THAT HE SHOULD HAVE LENT A HAND TO IT THAT
HE SHOULD HAVE EITHER COMPROMISED OR DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF THEREIN THAT
HE SHOULD HAVE TOUCHED THE AXE OR WIELDED THE SWORD IN IT
WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES OF A DYNASTY IT SHOULD BE NATIONAL THAT IS TO
SAY REVOLUTIONARY AT A DISTANCE NOT THROUGH ACTS COMMITTED BUT BY
REASON OF IDEAS ACCEPTED
IT SHOULD BE COMPOSED OF PAST AND BE HISTORIC
BE COMPOSED OF FUTURE AND BE SYMPATHETIC
ALL THIS EXPLAINS WHY THE EARLY REVOLUTIONS CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH
FINDING A MAN CROMWELL OR NAPOLEON AND WHY THE SECOND ABSOLUTELY
INSISTED ON FINDING A FAMILY THE HOUSE OF BRUNSWICK OR THE HOUSE OF
ORLEANS
ROYAL HOUSES RESEMBLE THOSE INDIAN FIG TREES EACH BRANCH OF WHICH
BENDING OVER TO THE EARTH TAKES ROOT AND BECOMES A FIG TREE ITSELF
EACH BRANCH MAY BECOME A DYNASTY
ON THE SOLE CONDITION THAT IT SHALL
BEND DOWN TO THE PEOPLE
SUCH IS THE THEORY OF THE SKILFUL
HERE THEN LIES THE GREAT ART TO MAKE A LITTLE RENDER TO SUCCESS THE
SOUND OF A CATASTROPHE IN ORDER THAT THOSE WHO PROFIT BY IT MAY TREMBLE
FROM IT ALSO TO SEASON WITH FEAR EVERY STEP THAT IS TAKEN TO AUGMENT
THE CURVE OF THE TRANSITION TO THE POINT OF RETARDING PROGRESS TO DULL
THAT AURORA TO DENOUNCE AND RETRENCH THE HARSHNESS OF ENTHUSIASM TO
CUT ALL ANGLES AND NAILS TO WAD TRIUMPH TO MUFFLE UP RIGHT TO ENVELOP
THE GIANT PEOPLE IN FLANNEL AND TO PUT IT TO BED VERY SPEEDILY TO
IMPOSE A DIET ON THAT EXCESS OF HEALTH TO PUT HERCULES ON THE TREATMENT
OF A CONVALESCENT TO DILUTE THE EVENT WITH THE EXPEDIENT TO OFFER TO
SPIRITS THIRSTING FOR THE IDEAL THAT NECTAR THINNED OUT WITH A POTION
TO TAKE ONE'S PRECAUTIONS AGAINST TOO MUCH SUCCESS TO GARNISH THE
REVOLUTION WITH A SHADE
1830 PRACTISED THIS THEORY ALREADY APPLIED TO ENGLAND BY 1688
1830 IS A REVOLUTION ARRESTED MIDWAY
HALF OF PROGRESS QUASI RIGHT
NOW LOGIC KNOWS NOT THE ALMOST ABSOLUTELY AS THE SUN KNOWS NOT THE
CANDLE
WHO ARRESTS REVOLUTIONS HALF WAY THE BOURGEOISIE
WHY
BECAUSE THE BOURGEOISIE IS INTEREST WHICH HAS REACHED SATISFACTION
YESTERDAY IT WAS APPETITE TO DAY IT IS PLENITUDE TO MORROW IT WILL BE
SATIETY
THE PHENOMENON OF 1814 AFTER NAPOLEON WAS REPRODUCED IN 1830 AFTER
CHARLES X
THE ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE AND WRONGLY TO MAKE A CLASS OF THE
BOURGEOISIE
THE BOURGEOISIE IS SIMPLY THE CONTENTED PORTION OF THE
PEOPLE
THE BOURGEOIS IS THE MAN WHO NOW HAS TIME TO SIT DOWN
A CHAIR
IS NOT A CASTE
BUT THROUGH A DESIRE TO SIT DOWN TOO SOON ONE MAY ARREST THE VERY MARCH
OF THE HUMAN RACE
THIS HAS OFTEN BEEN THE FAULT OF THE BOURGEOISIE
ONE IS NOT A CLASS BECAUSE ONE HAS COMMITTED A FAULT
SELFISHNESS IS NOT
ONE OF THE DIVISIONS OF THE SOCIAL ORDER
MOREOVER WE MUST BE JUST TO SELFISHNESS
THE STATE TO WHICH THAT PART
OF THE NATION WHICH IS CALLED THE BOURGEOISIE ASPIRED AFTER THE SHOCK
OF 1830 WAS NOT THE INERTIA WHICH IS COMPLICATED WITH INDIFFERENCE AND
LAZINESS AND WHICH CONTAINS A LITTLE SHAME IT WAS NOT THE SLUMBER
WHICH PRESUPPOSES A MOMENTARY FORGETFULNESS ACCESSIBLE TO DREAMS IT WAS
THE HALT
THE HALT IS A WORD FORMED OF A SINGULAR DOUBLE AND ALMOST CONTRADICTORY
SENSE A TROOP ON THE MARCH THAT IS TO SAY MOVEMENT A STAND THAT IS
TO SAY REPOSE
THE HALT IS THE RESTORATION OF FORCES IT IS REPOSE ARMED AND ON THE
ALERT IT IS THE ACCOMPLISHED FACT WHICH POSTS SENTINELS AND HOLDS
ITSELF ON ITS GUARD
THE HALT PRESUPPOSES THE COMBAT OF YESTERDAY AND THE COMBAT OF
TO MORROW
IT IS THE PARTITION BETWEEN 1830 AND 1848
WHAT WE HERE CALL COMBAT MAY ALSO BE DESIGNATED AS PROGRESS
THE BOURGEOISIE THEN AS WELL AS THE STATESMEN REQUIRED A MAN WHO
SHOULD EXPRESS THIS WORD HALT
AN ALTHOUGH BECAUSE
A COMPOSITE
INDIVIDUALITY SIGNIFYING REVOLUTION AND SIGNIFYING STABILITY IN OTHER
TERMS STRENGTHENING THE PRESENT BY THE EVIDENT COMPATIBILITY OF THE
PAST WITH THE FUTURE
THIS MAN WAS ALREADY FOUND HIS NAME WAS LOUIS PHILIPPE D'ORLEANS
THE 221 MADE LOUIS PHILIPPE KING
LAFAYETTE UNDERTOOK THE CORONATION
HE CALLED IT THE BEST OF REPUBLICS
THE TOWN HALL OF PARIS TOOK THE
PLACE OF THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS
THIS SUBSTITUTION OF A HALF THRONE FOR A WHOLE THRONE WAS THE WORK OF
1830
WHEN THE SKILFUL HAD FINISHED THE IMMENSE VICE OF THEIR SOLUTION BECAME
APPARENT
ALL THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF ABSOLUTE
RIGHT
ABSOLUTE RIGHT CRIED I PROTEST THEN TERRIBLE TO SAY IT
RETIRED INTO THE DARKNESS
CHAPTER III LOUIS PHILIPPE
REVOLUTIONS HAVE A TERRIBLE ARM AND A HAPPY HAND THEY STRIKE FIRMLY AND
CHOOSE WELL
EVEN INCOMPLETE EVEN DEBASED AND ABUSED AND REDUCED TO THE
STATE OF A JUNIOR REVOLUTION LIKE THE REVOLUTION OF 1830 THEY NEARLY
ALWAYS RETAIN SUFFICIENT PROVIDENTIAL LUCIDITY TO PREVENT THEM FROM
FALLING AMISS
THEIR ECLIPSE IS NEVER AN ABDICATION
NEVERTHELESS LET US NOT BOAST TOO LOUDLY REVOLUTIONS ALSO MAY BE
DECEIVED AND GRAVE ERRORS HAVE BEEN SEEN
LET US RETURN TO 1830
1830 IN ITS DEVIATION HAD GOOD LUCK
IN THE
ESTABLISHMENT WHICH ENTITLED ITSELF ORDER AFTER THE REVOLUTION HAD BEEN
CUT SHORT THE KING AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN ROYALTY
LOUIS PHILIPPE WAS A
RARE MAN
THE SON OF A FATHER TO WHOM HISTORY WILL ACCORD CERTAIN ATTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT ALSO AS WORTHY OF ESTEEM AS THAT FATHER HAD BEEN OF
BLAME POSSESSING ALL PRIVATE VIRTUES AND MANY PUBLIC VIRTUES CAREFUL
OF HIS HEALTH OF HIS FORTUNE OF HIS PERSON OF HIS AFFAIRS KNOWING
THE VALUE OF A MINUTE AND NOT ALWAYS THE VALUE OF A YEAR SOBER SERENE
PEACEABLE PATIENT A GOOD MAN AND A GOOD PRINCE SLEEPING WITH HIS
WIFE AND HAVING IN HIS PALACE LACKEYS CHARGED WITH THE DUTY OF SHOWING
THE CONJUGAL BED TO THE BOURGEOIS AN OSTENTATION OF THE REGULAR
SLEEPING APARTMENT WHICH HAD BECOME USEFUL AFTER THE FORMER ILLEGITIMATE
DISPLAYS OF THE ELDER BRANCH KNOWING ALL THE LANGUAGES OF EUROPE AND
WHAT IS MORE RARE ALL THE LANGUAGES OF ALL INTERESTS AND SPEAKING
THEM AN ADMIRABLE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS BUT
OUTSTRIPPING IT AND IN EVERY WAY GREATER THAN IT POSSESSING EXCELLENT
SENSE WHILE APPRECIATING THE BLOOD FROM WHICH HE HAD SPRUNG COUNTING
MOST OF ALL ON HIS INTRINSIC WORTH AND ON THE QUESTION OF HIS RACE
VERY PARTICULAR DECLARING HIMSELF ORLEANS AND NOT BOURBON THOROUGHLY
THE FIRST PRINCE OF THE BLOOD ROYAL WHILE HE WAS STILL ONLY A SERENE
HIGHNESS BUT A FRANK BOURGEOIS FROM THE DAY HE BECAME KING DIFFUSE IN
PUBLIC CONCISE IN PRIVATE REPUTED BUT NOT PROVED TO BE A MISER AT
BOTTOM ONE OF THOSE ECONOMISTS WHO ARE READILY PRODIGAL AT THEIR OWN
FANCY OR DUTY LETTERED BUT NOT VERY SENSITIVE TO LETTERS A GENTLEMAN
BUT NOT A CHEVALIER SIMPLE CALM AND STRONG ADORED BY HIS FAMILY AND
HIS HOUSEHOLD A FASCINATING TALKER AN UNDECEIVED STATESMAN INWARDLY
COLD DOMINATED BY IMMEDIATE INTEREST ALWAYS GOVERNING AT THE SHORTEST
RANGE INCAPABLE OF RANCOR AND OF GRATITUDE MAKING USE WITHOUT MERCY OF
SUPERIORITY ON MEDIOCRITY CLEVER IN GETTING PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITIES TO
PUT IN THE WRONG THOSE MYSTERIOUS UNANIMITIES WHICH MUTTER DULLY UNDER
THRONES UNRESERVED SOMETIMES IMPRUDENT IN HIS LACK OF RESERVE BUT
WITH MARVELLOUS ADDRESS IN THAT IMPRUDENCE FERTILE IN EXPEDIENTS IN
COUNTENANCES IN MASKS MAKING FRANCE FEAR EUROPE AND EUROPE FRANCE
INCONTESTABLY FOND OF HIS COUNTRY BUT PREFERRING HIS FAMILY ASSUMING
MORE DOMINATION THAN AUTHORITY AND MORE AUTHORITY THAN DIGNITY A
DISPOSITION WHICH HAS THIS UNFORTUNATE PROPERTY THAT AS IT TURNS
EVERYTHING TO SUCCESS IT ADMITS OF RUSE AND DOES NOT ABSOLUTELY
REPUDIATE BASENESS BUT WHICH HAS THIS VALUABLE SIDE THAT IT PRESERVES
POLITICS FROM VIOLENT SHOCKS THE STATE FROM FRACTURES AND SOCIETY
FROM CATASTROPHES MINUTE CORRECT VIGILANT ATTENTIVE SAGACIOUS
INDEFATIGABLE CONTRADICTING HIMSELF AT TIMES AND GIVING HIMSELF THE
LIE BOLD AGAINST AUSTRIA AT ANCONA OBSTINATE AGAINST ENGLAND IN SPAIN
BOMBARDING ANTWERP AND PAYING OFF PRITCHARD SINGING THE MARSEILLAISE
WITH CONVICTION INACCESSIBLE TO DESPONDENCY TO LASSITUDE TO THE TASTE
FOR THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE IDEAL TO DARING GENEROSITY TO UTOPIA TO
CHIMERAS TO WRATH TO VANITY TO FEAR POSSESSING ALL THE FORMS
OF PERSONAL INTREPIDITY A GENERAL AT VALMY A SOLDIER AT JEMAPPES
ATTACKED EIGHT TIMES BY REGICIDES AND ALWAYS SMILING
BRAVE AS A
GRENADIER COURAGEOUS AS A THINKER UNEASY ONLY IN THE FACE OF THE
CHANCES OF A EUROPEAN SHAKING UP AND UNFITTED FOR GREAT POLITICAL
ADVENTURES ALWAYS READY TO RISK HIS LIFE NEVER HIS WORK DISGUISING
HIS WILL IN INFLUENCE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE OBEYED AS AN
INTELLIGENCE RATHER THAN AS A KING ENDOWED WITH OBSERVATION AND NOT
WITH DIVINATION NOT VERY ATTENTIVE TO MINDS BUT KNOWING MEN THAT IS
TO SAY REQUIRING TO SEE IN ORDER TO JUDGE PROMPT AND PENETRATING
GOOD SENSE PRACTICAL WISDOM EASY SPEECH PRODIGIOUS MEMORY DRAWING
INCESSANTLY ON THIS MEMORY HIS ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE WITH CAESAR
ALEXANDER AND NAPOLEON KNOWING DEEDS FACTS DETAILS DATES PROPER
NAMES IGNORANT OF TENDENCIES PASSIONS THE DIVERSE GENIUSES OF THE
CROWD THE INTERIOR ASPIRATIONS THE HIDDEN AND OBSCURE UPRISINGS OF
SOULS IN A WORD ALL THAT CAN BE DESIGNATED AS THE INVISIBLE CURRENTS
OF CONSCIENCES ACCEPTED BY THE SURFACE BUT LITTLE IN ACCORD WITH
FRANCE LOWER DOWN EXTRICATING HIMSELF BY DINT OF TACT GOVERNING TOO
MUCH AND NOT ENOUGH HIS OWN FIRST MINISTER EXCELLENT AT CREATING OUT
OF THE PETTINESS OF REALITIES AN OBSTACLE TO THE IMMENSITY OF IDEAS
MINGLING A GENUINE CREATIVE FACULTY OF CIVILIZATION OF ORDER AND
ORGANIZATION AN INDESCRIBABLE SPIRIT OF PROCEEDINGS AND CHICANERY THE
FOUNDER AND LAWYER OF A DYNASTY HAVING SOMETHING OF CHARLEMAGNE AND
SOMETHING OF AN ATTORNEY IN SHORT A LOFTY AND ORIGINAL FIGURE A
PRINCE WHO UNDERSTOOD HOW TO CREATE AUTHORITY IN SPITE OF THE UNEASINESS
OF FRANCE AND POWER IN SPITE OF THE JEALOUSY OF EUROPE
LOUIS PHILIPPE
WILL BE CLASSED AMONG THE EMINENT MEN OF HIS CENTURY AND WOULD BE
RANKED AMONG THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS GOVERNORS OF HISTORY HAD HE LOVED
GLORY BUT A LITTLE AND IF HE HAD HAD THE SENTIMENT OF WHAT IS GREAT TO
THE SAME DEGREE AS THE FEELING FOR WHAT IS USEFUL
LOUIS PHILIPPE HAD BEEN HANDSOME AND IN HIS OLD AGE HE REMAINED
GRACEFUL NOT ALWAYS APPROVED BY THE NATION HE ALWAYS WAS SO BY THE
MASSES HE PLEASED
HE HAD THAT GIFT OF CHARMING
HE LACKED MAJESTY HE
WORE NO CROWN ALTHOUGH A KING AND NO WHITE HAIR ALTHOUGH AN OLD MAN
HIS MANNERS BELONGED TO THE OLD REGIME AND HIS HABITS TO THE NEW A
MIXTURE OF THE NOBLE AND THE BOURGEOIS WHICH SUITED 1830 LOUIS PHILIPPE
WAS TRANSITION REIGNING HE HAD PRESERVED THE ANCIENT PRONUNCIATION
AND THE ANCIENT ORTHOGRAPHY WHICH HE PLACED AT THE SERVICE OF OPINIONS
MODERN HE LOVED POLAND AND HUNGARY BUT HE WROTE LES POLONOIS AND HE
PRONOUNCED LES HONGRAIS
HE WORE THE UNIFORM OF THE NATIONAL GUARD LIKE
CHARLES X AND THE RIBBON OF THE LEGION OF HONOR LIKE NAPOLEON
HE WENT A LITTLE TO CHAPEL NOT AT ALL TO THE CHASE NEVER TO THE OPERA
INCORRUPTIBLE BY SACRISTANS BY WHIPPERS IN BY BALLET DANCERS THIS
MADE A PART OF HIS BOURGEOIS POPULARITY
HE HAD NO HEART
HE WENT OUT
WITH HIS UMBRELLA UNDER HIS ARM AND THIS UMBRELLA LONG FORMED A PART OF
HIS AUREOLE
HE WAS A BIT OF A MASON A BIT OF A GARDENER SOMETHING
OF A DOCTOR HE BLED A POSTILION WHO HAD TUMBLED FROM HIS HORSE LOUIS
PHILIPPE NO MORE WENT ABOUT WITHOUT HIS LANCET THAN DID HENRI IV
WITHOUT HIS PONIARD
THE ROYALISTS JEERED AT THIS RIDICULOUS KING THE
FIRST WHO HAD EVER SHED BLOOD WITH THE OBJECT OF HEALING
FOR THE GRIEVANCES AGAINST LOUIS PHILIPPE THERE IS ONE DEDUCTION TO BE
MADE THERE IS THAT WHICH ACCUSES ROYALTY THAT WHICH ACCUSES THE REIGN
THAT WHICH ACCUSES THE KING THREE COLUMNS WHICH ALL GIVE DIFFERENT
TOTALS
DEMOCRATIC RIGHT CONFISCATED PROGRESS BECOMES A MATTER OF
SECONDARY INTEREST THE PROTESTS OF THE STREET VIOLENTLY REPRESSED
MILITARY EXECUTION OF INSURRECTIONS THE RISING PASSED OVER BY ARMS THE
RUE TRANSNONAIN THE COUNSELS OF WAR THE ABSORPTION OF THE REAL
COUNTRY BY THE LEGAL COUNTRY ON HALF SHARES WITH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND
PRIVILEGED PERSONS THESE ARE THE DEEDS OF ROYALTY BELGIUM REFUSED
ALGERIA TOO HARSHLY CONQUERED AND AS IN THE CASE OF INDIA BY THE
ENGLISH WITH MORE BARBARISM THAN CIVILIZATION THE BREACH OF FAITH TO
ABD EL KADER BLAYE DEUTZ BOUGHT PRITCHARD PAID THESE ARE THE DOINGS
OF THE REIGN THE POLICY WHICH WAS MORE DOMESTIC THAN NATIONAL WAS THE
DOING OF THE KING
AS WILL BE SEEN THE PROPER DEDUCTION HAVING BEEN MADE THE KING'S
CHARGE IS DECREASED
THIS IS HIS GREAT FAULT HE WAS MODEST IN THE NAME OF FRANCE
WHENCE ARISES THIS FAULT
WE WILL STATE IT
LOUIS PHILIPPE WAS RATHER TOO MUCH OF A PATERNAL KING THAT INCUBATION
OF A FAMILY WITH THE OBJECT OF FOUNDING A DYNASTY IS AFRAID OF
EVERYTHING AND DOES NOT LIKE TO BE DISTURBED HENCE EXCESSIVE TIMIDITY
WHICH IS DISPLEASING TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE 14TH OF JULY IN THEIR
CIVIL AND AUSTERLITZ IN THEIR MILITARY TRADITION
MOREOVER IF WE DEDUCT THE PUBLIC DUTIES WHICH REQUIRE TO BE FULFILLED
FIRST OF ALL THAT DEEP TENDERNESS OF LOUIS PHILIPPE TOWARDS HIS
FAMILY WAS DESERVED BY THE FAMILY
THAT DOMESTIC GROUP WAS WORTHY OF
ADMIRATION
VIRTUES THERE DWELT SIDE BY SIDE WITH TALENTS
ONE OF LOUIS
PHILIPPE'S DAUGHTERS MARIE D'ORLEANS PLACED THE NAME OF HER RACE AMONG
ARTISTS AS CHARLES D'ORLEANS HAD PLACED IT AMONG POETS
SHE MADE OF
HER SOUL A MARBLE WHICH SHE NAMED JEANNE D'ARC
TWO OF LOUIS PHILIPPE'S
DAUGHTERS ELICITED FROM METTERNICH THIS EULOGIUM THEY ARE YOUNG PEOPLE
SUCH AS ARE RARELY SEEN AND PRINCES SUCH AS ARE NEVER SEEN
THIS WITHOUT ANY DISSIMULATION AND ALSO WITHOUT ANY EXAGGERATION IS
THE TRUTH ABOUT LOUIS PHILIPPE
TO BE PRINCE EQUALITY TO BEAR IN HIS OWN PERSON THE CONTRADICTION OF
THE RESTORATION AND THE REVOLUTION TO HAVE THAT DISQUIETING SIDE OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY WHICH BECOMES REASSURING IN GOVERNING POWER THEREIN LAY
THE FORTUNE OF LOUIS PHILIPPE IN 1830 NEVER WAS THERE A MORE COMPLETE
ADAPTATION OF A MAN TO AN EVENT THE ONE ENTERED INTO THE OTHER AND THE
INCARNATION TOOK PLACE
LOUIS PHILIPPE IS 1830 MADE MAN
MOREOVER HE
HAD IN HIS FAVOR THAT GREAT RECOMMENDATION TO THE THRONE EXILE
HE HAD
BEEN PROSCRIBED A WANDERER POOR
HE HAD LIVED BY HIS OWN LABOR
IN
SWITZERLAND THIS HEIR TO THE RICHEST PRINCELY DOMAINS IN FRANCE HAD
SOLD AN OLD HORSE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN BREAD
AT REICHENAU HE GAVE
LESSONS IN MATHEMATICS WHILE HIS SISTER ADELAIDE DID WOOL WORK AND
SEWED
THESE SOUVENIRS CONNECTED WITH A KING RENDERED THE BOURGEOISIE
ENTHUSIASTIC
HE HAD WITH HIS OWN HANDS DEMOLISHED THE IRON CAGE OF
MONT SAINT MICHEL BUILT BY LOUIS XI AND USED BY LOUIS XV
HE WAS THE
COMPANION OF DUMOURIEZ HE WAS THE FRIEND OF LAFAYETTE HE HAD BELONGED
TO THE JACOBINS' CLUB MIRABEAU HAD SLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER DANTON
HAD SAID TO HIM YOUNG MAN AT THE AGE OF FOUR AND TWENTY IN '93
BEING THEN M
DE CHARTRES HE HAD WITNESSED FROM THE DEPTH OF A BOX
THE TRIAL OF LOUIS XVI SO WELL NAMED THAT POOR TYRANT
THE BLIND
CLAIRVOYANCE OF THE REVOLUTION BREAKING ROYALTY IN THE KING AND THE
KING WITH ROYALTY DID SO ALMOST WITHOUT NOTICING THE MAN IN THE FIERCE
CRUSHING OF THE IDEA THE VAST STORM OF THE ASSEMBLY TRIBUNAL THE
PUBLIC WRATH INTERROGATING CAPET NOT KNOWING WHAT TO REPLY THE
ALARMING STUPEFIED VACILLATION BY THAT ROYAL HEAD BENEATH THAT SOMBRE
BREATH THE RELATIVE INNOCENCE OF ALL IN THAT CATASTROPHE OF THOSE
WHO CONDEMNED AS WELL AS OF THE MAN CONDEMNED HE HAD LOOKED ON THOSE
THINGS HE HAD CONTEMPLATED THAT GIDDINESS HE HAD SEEN THE CENTURIES
APPEAR BEFORE THE BAR OF THE ASSEMBLY CONVENTION HE HAD BEHELD BEHIND
LOUIS XVI THAT UNFORTUNATE PASSER BY WHO WAS MADE RESPONSIBLE THE
TERRIBLE CULPRIT THE MONARCHY RISE THROUGH THE SHADOWS AND THERE HAD
LINGERED IN HIS SOUL THE RESPECTFUL FEAR OF THESE IMMENSE JUSTICES OF
THE POPULACE WHICH ARE ALMOST AS IMPERSONAL AS THE JUSTICE OF GOD
THE TRACE LEFT IN HIM BY THE REVOLUTION WAS PRODIGIOUS
ITS MEMORY WAS
LIKE A LIVING IMPRINT OF THOSE GREAT YEARS MINUTE BY MINUTE
ONE DAY
IN THE PRESENCE OF A WITNESS WHOM WE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO DOUBT HE
RECTIFIED FROM MEMORY THE WHOLE OF THE LETTER A IN THE ALPHABETICAL LIST
OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
LOUIS PHILIPPE WAS A KING OF THE BROAD DAYLIGHT
WHILE HE REIGNED THE
PRESS WAS FREE THE TRIBUNE WAS FREE CONSCIENCE AND SPEECH WERE FREE
THE LAWS OF SEPTEMBER ARE OPEN TO SIGHT
ALTHOUGH FULLY AWARE OF THE
GNAWING POWER OF LIGHT ON PRIVILEGES HE LEFT HIS THRONE EXPOSED TO THE
LIGHT
HISTORY WILL DO JUSTICE TO HIM FOR THIS LOYALTY
LOUIS PHILIPPE LIKE ALL HISTORICAL MEN WHO HAVE PASSED FROM THE SCENE
IS TO DAY PUT ON HIS TRIAL BY THE HUMAN CONSCIENCE
HIS CASE IS AS YET
ONLY IN THE LOWER COURT
THE HOUR WHEN HISTORY SPEAKS WITH ITS FREE AND VENERABLE ACCENT HAS
NOT YET SOUNDED FOR HIM THE MOMENT HAS NOT COME TO PRONOUNCE A DEFINITE
JUDGMENT ON THIS KING THE AUSTERE AND ILLUSTRIOUS HISTORIAN LOUIS BLANC
HAS HIMSELF RECENTLY SOFTENED HIS FIRST VERDICT LOUIS PHILIPPE WAS
ELECTED BY THOSE TWO ALMOSTS WHICH ARE CALLED THE 221 AND 1830 THAT IS
TO SAY BY A HALF PARLIAMENT AND A HALF REVOLUTION AND IN ANY CASE
FROM THE SUPERIOR POINT OF VIEW WHERE PHILOSOPHY MUST PLACE ITSELF WE
CANNOT JUDGE HIM HERE AS THE READER HAS SEEN ABOVE EXCEPT WITH CERTAIN
RESERVATIONS IN THE NAME OF THE ABSOLUTE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE IN THE
EYES OF THE ABSOLUTE OUTSIDE THESE TWO RIGHTS THE RIGHT OF MAN IN THE
FIRST PLACE THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE SECOND ALL IS USURPATION
BUT WHAT WE CAN SAY EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY THAT AFTER MAKING THESE
RESERVES IS THAT TO SUM UP THE WHOLE AND IN WHATEVER MANNER HE IS
CONSIDERED LOUIS PHILIPPE TAKEN IN HIMSELF AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW
OF HUMAN GOODNESS WILL REMAIN TO USE THE ANTIQUE LANGUAGE OF ANCIENT
HISTORY ONE OF THE BEST PRINCES WHO EVER SAT ON A THRONE
WHAT IS THERE AGAINST HIM THAT THRONE
TAKE AWAY LOUIS PHILIPPE THE
KING THERE REMAINS THE MAN
AND THE MAN IS GOOD
HE IS GOOD AT TIMES
EVEN TO THE POINT OF BEING ADMIRABLE
OFTEN IN THE MIDST OF HIS GRAVEST
SOUVENIRS AFTER A DAY OF CONFLICT WITH THE WHOLE DIPLOMACY OF THE
CONTINENT HE RETURNED AT NIGHT TO HIS APARTMENTS AND THERE EXHAUSTED
WITH FATIGUE OVERWHELMED WITH SLEEP WHAT DID HE DO HE TOOK A DEATH
SENTENCE AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN REVISING A CRIMINAL SUIT CONSIDERING
IT SOMETHING TO HOLD HIS OWN AGAINST EUROPE BUT THAT IT WAS A STILL
GREATER MATTER TO RESCUE A MAN FROM THE EXECUTIONER
HE OBSTINATELY
MAINTAINED HIS OPINION AGAINST HIS KEEPER OF THE SEALS HE DISPUTED THE
GROUND WITH THE GUILLOTINE FOOT BY FOOT AGAINST THE CROWN ATTORNEYS
THOSE CHATTERERS OF THE LAW AS HE CALLED THEM
SOMETIMES THE PILE OF
SENTENCES COVERED HIS TABLE HE EXAMINED THEM ALL IT WAS ANGUISH TO
HIM TO ABANDON THESE MISERABLE CONDEMNED HEADS
ONE DAY HE SAID TO
THE SAME WITNESS TO WHOM WE HAVE RECENTLY REFERRED I WON SEVEN LAST
NIGHT DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF HIS REIGN THE DEATH PENALTY WAS
AS GOOD AS ABOLISHED AND THE ERECTION OF A SCAFFOLD WAS A VIOLENCE
COMMITTED AGAINST THE KING
THE GREVE HAVING DISAPPEARED WITH THE ELDER
BRANCH A BOURGEOIS PLACE OF EXECUTION WAS INSTITUTED UNDER THE NAME
OF THE BARRIERE SAINT JACQUES PRACTICAL MEN FELT THE NECESSITY OF
A QUASI LEGITIMATE GUILLOTINE AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE VICTORIES OF
CASIMIR PERIER WHO REPRESENTED THE NARROW SIDES OF THE BOURGEOISIE
OVER LOUIS PHILIPPE WHO REPRESENTED ITS LIBERAL SIDES
LOUIS PHILIPPE
ANNOTATED BECCARIA WITH HIS OWN HAND
AFTER THE FIESCHI MACHINE HE
EXCLAIMED WHAT A PITY THAT I WAS NOT WOUNDED THEN I MIGHT HAVE
PARDONED ON ANOTHER OCCASION ALLUDING TO THE RESISTANCE OFFERED BY
HIS MINISTRY HE WROTE IN CONNECTION WITH A POLITICAL CRIMINAL WHO IS
ONE OF THE MOST GENEROUS FIGURES OF OUR DAY HIS PARDON IS GRANTED IT
ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO OBTAIN IT LOUIS PHILIPPE WAS AS GENTLE AS LOUIS
IX
AND AS KINDLY AS HENRI IV
NOW TO OUR MIND IN HISTORY WHERE KINDNESS IS THE RAREST OF PEARLS
THE MAN WHO IS KINDLY ALMOST TAKES PRECEDENCE OF THE MAN WHO IS GREAT
LOUIS PHILIPPE HAVING BEEN SEVERELY JUDGED BY SOME HARSHLY PERHAPS BY
OTHERS IT IS QUITE NATURAL THAT A MAN HIMSELF A PHANTOM AT THE PRESENT
DAY WHO KNEW THAT KING SHOULD COME AND TESTIFY IN HIS FAVOR BEFORE
HISTORY THIS DEPOSITION WHATEVER ELSE IT MAY BE IS EVIDENTLY AND
ABOVE ALL THINGS ENTIRELY DISINTERESTED AN EPITAPH PENNED BY A DEAD
MAN IS SINCERE ONE SHADE MAY CONSOLE ANOTHER SHADE THE SHARING OF THE
SAME SHADOWS CONFERS THE RIGHT TO PRAISE IT IT IS NOT GREATLY TO
BE FEARED THAT IT WILL EVER BE SAID OF TWO TOMBS IN EXILE THIS ONE
FLATTERED THE OTHER
CHAPTER IV CRACKS BENEATH THE FOUNDATION
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE DRAMA WHICH WE ARE NARRATING IS ON THE POINT OF
PENETRATING INTO THE DEPTHS OF ONE OF THE TRAGIC CLOUDS WHICH ENVELOP
THE BEGINNING OF LOUIS PHILIPPE'S REIGN IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THERE
SHOULD BE NO EQUIVOQUE AND IT BECAME REQUISITE THAT THIS BOOK SHOULD
OFFER SOME EXPLANATION WITH REGARD TO THIS KING
LOUIS PHILIPPE HAD ENTERED INTO POSSESSION OF HIS ROYAL AUTHORITY
WITHOUT VIOLENCE WITHOUT ANY DIRECT ACTION ON HIS PART BY VIRTUE OF A
REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE EVIDENTLY QUITE DISTINCT FROM THE REAL AIM OF THE
REVOLUTION BUT IN WHICH HE THE DUC D'ORLEANS EXERCISED NO PERSONAL
INITIATIVE
HE HAD BEEN BORN A PRINCE AND HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO HAVE
BEEN ELECTED KING
HE HAD NOT SERVED THIS MANDATE ON HIMSELF HE HAD NOT
TAKEN IT IT HAD BEEN OFFERED TO HIM AND HE HAD ACCEPTED IT CONVINCED
WRONGLY TO BE SURE BUT CONVINCED NEVERTHELESS THAT THE OFFER WAS IN
ACCORDANCE WITH RIGHT AND THAT THE ACCEPTANCE OF IT WAS IN ACCORDANCE
WITH DUTY
HENCE HIS POSSESSION WAS IN GOOD FAITH
NOW WE SAY IT IN
GOOD CONSCIENCE LOUIS PHILIPPE BEING IN POSSESSION IN PERFECT GOOD
FAITH AND THE DEMOCRACY BEING IN GOOD FAITH IN ITS ATTACK THE AMOUNT
OF TERROR DISCHARGED BY THE SOCIAL CONFLICTS WEIGHS NEITHER ON THE
KING NOR ON THE DEMOCRACY
A CLASH OF PRINCIPLES RESEMBLES A CLASH OF
ELEMENTS
THE OCEAN DEFENDS THE WATER THE HURRICANE DEFENDS THE
AIR THE KING DEFENDS ROYALTY THE DEMOCRACY DEFENDS THE PEOPLE THE
RELATIVE WHICH IS THE MONARCHY RESISTS THE ABSOLUTE WHICH IS THE
REPUBLIC SOCIETY BLEEDS IN THIS CONFLICT BUT THAT WHICH CONSTITUTES
ITS SUFFERING TO DAY WILL CONSTITUTE ITS SAFETY LATER ON AND IN ANY
CASE THOSE WHO COMBAT ARE NOT TO BE BLAMED ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES IS
EVIDENTLY MISTAKEN THE RIGHT IS NOT LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES ON
TWO SHORES AT ONCE WITH ONE FOOT ON THE REPUBLIC AND ONE IN ROYALTY
IT IS INDIVISIBLE AND ALL ON ONE SIDE BUT THOSE WHO ARE IN ERROR ARE
SO SINCERELY A BLIND MAN IS NO MORE A CRIMINAL THAN A VENDEAN IS A
RUFFIAN
LET US THEN IMPUTE TO THE FATALITY OF THINGS ALONE THESE
FORMIDABLE COLLISIONS
WHATEVER THE NATURE OF THESE TEMPESTS MAY BE
HUMAN IRRESPONSIBILITY IS MINGLED WITH THEM
LET US COMPLETE THIS EXPOSITION
THE GOVERNMENT OF 1830 LED A HARD LIFE IMMEDIATELY
BORN YESTERDAY IT
WAS OBLIGED TO FIGHT TO DAY
HARDLY INSTALLED IT WAS ALREADY EVERYWHERE CONSCIOUS OF VAGUE MOVEMENTS
OF TRACTION ON THE APPARATUS OF JULY SO RECENTLY LAID AND SO LACKING IN
SOLIDITY
RESISTANCE WAS BORN ON THE MORROW PERHAPS EVEN IT WAS BORN ON THE
PRECEDING EVENING
FROM MONTH TO MONTH THE HOSTILITY INCREASED AND FROM
BEING CONCEALED IT BECAME PATENT
THE REVOLUTION OF JULY WHICH GAINED BUT LITTLE ACCEPTANCE OUTSIDE OF
FRANCE BY KINGS HAD BEEN DIVERSELY INTERPRETED IN FRANCE AS WE HAVE
SAID
GOD DELIVERS OVER TO MEN HIS VISIBLE WILL IN EVENTS AN OBSCURE TEXT
WRITTEN IN A MYSTERIOUS TONGUE
MEN IMMEDIATELY MAKE TRANSLATIONS OF IT
TRANSLATIONS HASTY INCORRECT FULL OF ERRORS OF GAPS AND OF NONSENSE
VERY FEW MINDS COMPREHEND THE DIVINE LANGUAGE
THE MOST SAGACIOUS THE
CALMEST THE MOST PROFOUND DECIPHER SLOWLY AND WHEN THEY ARRIVE WITH
THEIR TEXT THE TASK HAS LONG BEEN COMPLETED THERE ARE ALREADY TWENTY
TRANSLATIONS ON THE PUBLIC PLACE
FROM EACH REMAINING SPRINGS A PARTY
AND FROM EACH MISINTERPRETATION A FACTION AND EACH PARTY THINKS THAT IT
ALONE HAS THE TRUE TEXT AND EACH FACTION THINKS THAT IT POSSESSES THE
LIGHT
POWER ITSELF IS OFTEN A FACTION
THERE ARE IN REVOLUTIONS SWIMMERS WHO GO AGAINST THE CURRENT THEY ARE
THE OLD PARTIES
FOR THE OLD PARTIES WHO CLUNG TO HEREDITY BY THE GRACE OF GOD THINK
THAT REVOLUTIONS HAVING SPRUNG FROM THE RIGHT TO REVOLT ONE HAS THE
RIGHT TO REVOLT AGAINST THEM
ERROR
FOR IN THESE REVOLUTIONS THE ONE
WHO REVOLTS IS NOT THE PEOPLE IT IS THE KING
REVOLUTION IS PRECISELY
THE CONTRARY OF REVOLT
EVERY REVOLUTION BEING A NORMAL OUTCOME
CONTAINS WITHIN ITSELF ITS LEGITIMACY WHICH FALSE REVOLUTIONISTS
SOMETIMES DISHONOR BUT WHICH REMAINS EVEN WHEN SOILED WHICH SURVIVES
EVEN WHEN STAINED WITH BLOOD
REVOLUTIONS SPRING NOT FROM AN ACCIDENT BUT FROM NECESSITY
A
REVOLUTION IS A RETURN FROM THE FICTITIOUS TO THE REAL
IT IS BECAUSE IT
MUST BE THAT IT IS
NONE THE LESS DID THE OLD LEGITIMIST PARTIES ASSAIL THE REVOLUTION OF
1830 WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE WHICH ARISES FROM FALSE REASONING
ERRORS
MAKE EXCELLENT PROJECTILES
THEY STRIKE IT CLEVERLY IN ITS VULNERABLE
SPOT IN DEFAULT OF A CUIRASS IN ITS LACK OF LOGIC THEY ATTACKED THIS
REVOLUTION IN ITS ROYALTY
THEY SHOUTED TO IT REVOLUTION WHY THIS
KING FACTIONS ARE BLIND MEN WHO AIM CORRECTLY
THIS CRY WAS UTTERED EQUALLY BY THE REPUBLICANS
BUT COMING FROM
THEM THIS CRY WAS LOGICAL
WHAT WAS BLINDNESS IN THE LEGITIMISTS WAS
CLEARNESS OF VISION IN THE DEMOCRATS
1830 HAD BANKRUPTED THE PEOPLE
THE ENRAGED DEMOCRACY REPROACHED IT WITH THIS
BETWEEN THE ATTACK OF THE PAST AND THE ATTACK OF THE FUTURE THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF JULY STRUGGLED
IT REPRESENTED THE MINUTE AT
LOGGERHEADS ON THE ONE HAND WITH THE MONARCHICAL CENTURIES ON THE OTHER
HAND WITH ETERNAL RIGHT
IN ADDITION AND BESIDE ALL THIS AS IT WAS NO LONGER REVOLUTION AND HAD
BECOME A MONARCHY 1830 WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE PRECEDENCE OF ALL EUROPE
TO
KEEP THE PEACE WAS AN INCREASE OF COMPLICATION
A HARMONY ESTABLISHED
CONTRARY TO SENSE IS OFTEN MORE ONEROUS THAN A WAR
FROM THIS SECRET
CONFLICT ALWAYS MUZZLED BUT ALWAYS GROWLING WAS BORN ARMED PEACE
THAT RUINOUS EXPEDIENT OF CIVILIZATION WHICH IN THE HARNESS OF THE
EUROPEAN CABINETS IS SUSPICIOUS IN ITSELF
THE ROYALTY OF JULY REARED
UP IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT CAUGHT IT IN THE HARNESS OF EUROPEAN
CABINETS
METTERNICH WOULD GLADLY HAVE PUT IT IN KICKING STRAPS
PUSHED
ON IN FRANCE BY PROGRESS IT PUSHED ON THE MONARCHIES THOSE LOITERERS
IN EUROPE
AFTER HAVING BEEN TOWED IT UNDERTOOK TO TOW
MEANWHILE WITHIN HER PAUPERISM THE PROLETARIAT SALARY EDUCATION
PENAL SERVITUDE PROSTITUTION THE FATE OF THE WOMAN WEALTH MISERY
PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION DIVISION EXCHANGE COIN CREDIT THE RIGHTS OF
CAPITAL THE RIGHTS OF LABOR ALL THESE QUESTIONS WERE MULTIPLIED ABOVE
SOCIETY A TERRIBLE SLOPE
OUTSIDE OF POLITICAL PARTIES PROPERLY SO CALLED ANOTHER MOVEMENT BECAME
MANIFEST
PHILOSOPHICAL FERMENTATION REPLIED TO DEMOCRATIC FERMENTATION
THE ELECT FELT TROUBLED AS WELL AS THE MASSES IN ANOTHER MANNER BUT
QUITE AS MUCH
THINKERS MEDITATED WHILE THE SOIL THAT IS TO SAY THE PEOPLE
TRAVERSED BY REVOLUTIONARY CURRENTS TREMBLED UNDER THEM WITH
INDESCRIBABLY VAGUE EPILEPTIC SHOCKS
THESE DREAMERS SOME ISOLATED
OTHERS UNITED IN FAMILIES AND ALMOST IN COMMUNION TURNED OVER SOCIAL
QUESTIONS IN A PACIFIC BUT PROFOUND MANNER IMPASSIVE MINERS WHO
TRANQUILLY PUSHED THEIR GALLERIES INTO THE DEPTHS OF A VOLCANO HARDLY
DISTURBED BY THE DULL COMMOTION AND THE FURNACES OF WHICH THEY CAUGHT
GLIMPSES
THIS TRANQUILLITY WAS NOT THE LEAST BEAUTIFUL SPECTACLE OF THIS AGITATED
EPOCH
THESE MEN LEFT TO POLITICAL PARTIES THE QUESTION OF RIGHTS THEY
OCCUPIED THEMSELVES WITH THE QUESTION OF HAPPINESS
THE WELL BEING OF MAN THAT WAS WHAT THEY WANTED TO EXTRACT FROM
SOCIETY
THEY RAISED MATERIAL QUESTIONS QUESTIONS OF AGRICULTURE OF INDUSTRY
OF COMMERCE ALMOST TO THE DIGNITY OF A RELIGION
IN CIVILIZATION SUCH
AS IT HAS FORMED ITSELF A LITTLE BY THE COMMAND OF GOD A GREAT DEAL BY
THE AGENCY OF MAN INTERESTS COMBINE UNITE AND AMALGAMATE IN A
MANNER TO FORM A VERITABLE HARD ROCK IN ACCORDANCE WITH A DYNAMIC LAW
PATIENTLY STUDIED BY ECONOMISTS THOSE GEOLOGISTS OF POLITICS
THESE MEN
WHO GROUPED THEMSELVES UNDER DIFFERENT APPELLATIONS BUT WHO MAY ALL BE
DESIGNATED BY THE GENERIC TITLE OF SOCIALISTS ENDEAVORED TO PIERCE THAT
ROCK AND TO CAUSE IT TO SPOUT FORTH THE LIVING WATERS OF HUMAN FELICITY
FROM THE QUESTION OF THE SCAFFOLD TO THE QUESTION OF WAR THEIR WORKS
EMBRACED EVERYTHING
TO THE RIGHTS OF MAN AS PROCLAIMED BY THE FRENCH
REVOLUTION THEY ADDED THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN AND THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD
THE READER WILL NOT BE SURPRISED IF FOR VARIOUS REASONS WE DO NOT
HERE TREAT IN A THOROUGH MANNER FROM THE THEORETICAL POINT OF VIEW THE
QUESTIONS RAISED BY SOCIALISM
WE CONFINE OURSELVES TO INDICATING THEM
ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THE SOCIALISTS PROPOSED TO THEMSELVES COSMOGONIC
VISIONS REVERY AND MYSTICISM BEING CAST ASIDE CAN BE REDUCED TO TWO
PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS
FIRST PROBLEM TO PRODUCE WEALTH
SECOND PROBLEM TO SHARE IT
THE FIRST PROBLEM CONTAINS THE QUESTION OF WORK
THE SECOND CONTAINS THE QUESTION OF SALARY
IN THE FIRST PROBLEM THE EMPLOYMENT OF FORCES IS IN QUESTION
IN THE SECOND THE DISTRIBUTION OF ENJOYMENT
FROM THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF FORCES RESULTS PUBLIC POWER
FROM A GOOD DISTRIBUTION OF ENJOYMENTS RESULTS INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS
BY A GOOD DISTRIBUTION NOT AN EQUAL BUT AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION MUST
BE UNDERSTOOD
FROM THESE TWO THINGS COMBINED THE PUBLIC POWER WITHOUT INDIVIDUAL
HAPPINESS WITHIN RESULTS SOCIAL PROSPERITY
SOCIAL PROSPERITY MEANS THE MAN HAPPY THE CITIZEN FREE THE NATION
GREAT
ENGLAND SOLVES THE FIRST OF THESE TWO PROBLEMS
SHE CREATES WEALTH
ADMIRABLY SHE DIVIDES IT BADLY
THIS SOLUTION WHICH IS COMPLETE ON
ONE SIDE ONLY LEADS HER FATALLY TO TWO EXTREMES MONSTROUS OPULENCE
MONSTROUS WRETCHEDNESS
ALL ENJOYMENTS FOR SOME ALL PRIVATIONS FOR THE
REST THAT IS TO SAY FOR THE PEOPLE PRIVILEGE EXCEPTION MONOPOLY
FEUDALISM BORN FROM TOIL ITSELF
A FALSE AND DANGEROUS SITUATION WHICH
SATES PUBLIC POWER OR PRIVATE MISERY WHICH SETS THE ROOTS OF THE STATE
IN THE SUFFERINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
A BADLY CONSTITUTED GRANDEUR IN
WHICH ARE COMBINED ALL THE MATERIAL ELEMENTS AND INTO WHICH NO MORAL
ELEMENT ENTERS
COMMUNISM AND AGRARIAN LAW THINK THAT THEY SOLVE THE SECOND PROBLEM
THEY ARE MISTAKEN
THEIR DIVISION KILLS PRODUCTION
EQUAL PARTITION
ABOLISHES EMULATION AND CONSEQUENTLY LABOR
IT IS A PARTITION MADE
BY THE BUTCHER WHICH KILLS THAT WHICH IT DIVIDES
IT IS THEREFORE
IMPOSSIBLE TO PAUSE OVER THESE PRETENDED SOLUTIONS
SLAYING WEALTH IS
NOT THE SAME THING AS DIVIDING IT
THE TWO PROBLEMS REQUIRE TO BE SOLVED TOGETHER TO BE WELL SOLVED
THE
TWO PROBLEMS MUST BE COMBINED AND MADE BUT ONE
SOLVE ONLY THE FIRST OF THE TWO PROBLEMS YOU WILL BE VENICE YOU WILL
BE ENGLAND
YOU WILL HAVE LIKE VENICE AN ARTIFICIAL POWER OR LIKE
ENGLAND A MATERIAL POWER YOU WILL BE THE WICKED RICH MAN
YOU WILL DIE
BY AN ACT OF VIOLENCE AS VENICE DIED OR BY BANKRUPTCY AS ENGLAND
WILL FALL
AND THE WORLD WILL ALLOW TO DIE AND FALL ALL THAT IS MERELY
SELFISHNESS ALL THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT FOR THE HUMAN RACE EITHER A
VIRTUE OR AN IDEA
IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD HERE THAT BY THE WORDS VENICE ENGLAND WE
DESIGNATE NOT THE PEOPLES BUT SOCIAL STRUCTURES THE OLIGARCHIES
SUPERPOSED ON NATIONS AND NOT THE NATIONS THEMSELVES
THE NATIONS
ALWAYS HAVE OUR RESPECT AND OUR SYMPATHY
VENICE AS A PEOPLE WILL LIVE
AGAIN ENGLAND THE ARISTOCRACY WILL FALL BUT ENGLAND THE NATION IS
IMMORTAL
THAT SAID WE CONTINUE
SOLVE THE TWO PROBLEMS ENCOURAGE THE WEALTHY AND PROTECT THE POOR
SUPPRESS MISERY PUT AN END TO THE UNJUST FARMING OUT OF THE FEEBLE BY
THE STRONG PUT A BRIDLE ON THE INIQUITOUS JEALOUSY OF THE MAN WHO
IS MAKING HIS WAY AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAS REACHED THE GOAL ADJUST
MATHEMATICALLY AND FRATERNALLY SALARY TO LABOR MINGLE GRATUITOUS AND
COMPULSORY EDUCATION WITH THE GROWTH OF CHILDHOOD AND MAKE OF SCIENCE
THE BASE OF MANLINESS DEVELOP MINDS WHILE KEEPING ARMS BUSY BE AT ONE
AND THE SAME TIME A POWERFUL PEOPLE AND A FAMILY OF HAPPY MEN RENDER
PROPERTY DEMOCRATIC NOT BY ABOLISHING IT BUT BY MAKING IT UNIVERSAL
SO THAT EVERY CITIZEN WITHOUT EXCEPTION MAY BE A PROPRIETOR AN EASIER
MATTER THAN IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED IN TWO WORDS LEARN HOW TO PRODUCE
WEALTH AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE IT AND YOU WILL HAVE AT ONCE MORAL AND
MATERIAL GREATNESS AND YOU WILL BE WORTHY TO CALL YOURSELF FRANCE
THIS IS WHAT SOCIALISM SAID OUTSIDE AND ABOVE A FEW SECTS WHICH HAVE
GONE ASTRAY THAT IS WHAT IT SOUGHT IN FACTS THAT IS WHAT IT SKETCHED
OUT IN MINDS
EFFORTS WORTHY OF ADMIRATION SACRED ATTEMPTS
THESE DOCTRINES THESE THEORIES THESE RESISTANCES THE UNFORESEEN
NECESSITY FOR THE STATESMAN TO TAKE PHILOSOPHERS INTO ACCOUNT CONFUSED
EVIDENCES OF WHICH WE CATCH A GLIMPSE A NEW SYSTEM OF POLITICS TO BE
CREATED WHICH SHALL BE IN ACCORD WITH THE OLD WORLD WITHOUT TOO MUCH
DISACCORD WITH THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY IDEAL A SITUATION IN WHICH IT
BECAME NECESSARY TO USE LAFAYETTE TO DEFEND POLIGNAC THE INTUITION OF
PROGRESS TRANSPARENT BENEATH THE REVOLT THE CHAMBERS AND STREETS THE
COMPETITIONS TO BE BROUGHT INTO EQUILIBRIUM AROUND HIM HIS FAITH IN
THE REVOLUTION PERHAPS AN EVENTUAL INDEFINABLE RESIGNATION BORN OF THE
VAGUE ACCEPTANCE OF A SUPERIOR DEFINITIVE RIGHT HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN OF
HIS RACE HIS DOMESTIC SPIRIT HIS SINCERE RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE HIS
OWN HONESTY PREOCCUPIED LOUIS PHILIPPE ALMOST PAINFULLY AND THERE WERE
MOMENTS WHEN STRONG AND COURAGEOUS AS HE WAS HE WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE
DIFFICULTIES OF BEING A KING
HE FELT UNDER HIS FEET A FORMIDABLE DISAGGREGATION WHICH WAS NOT
NEVERTHELESS A REDUCTION TO DUST FRANCE BEING MORE FRANCE THAN EVER
PILES OF SHADOWS COVERED THE HORIZON
A STRANGE SHADE GRADUALLY DRAWING
NEARER EXTENDED LITTLE BY LITTLE OVER MEN OVER THINGS OVER IDEAS
A SHADE WHICH CAME FROM WRATHS AND SYSTEMS
EVERYTHING WHICH HAD BEEN
HASTILY STIFLED WAS MOVING AND FERMENTING
AT TIMES THE CONSCIENCE OF
THE HONEST MAN RESUMED ITS BREATHING SO GREAT WAS THE DISCOMFORT
OF THAT AIR IN WHICH SOPHISMS WERE INTERMINGLED WITH TRUTHS
SPIRITS
TREMBLED IN THE SOCIAL ANXIETY LIKE LEAVES AT THE APPROACH OF A STORM
THE ELECTRIC TENSION WAS SUCH THAT AT CERTAIN INSTANTS THE FIRST COMER
A STRANGER BROUGHT LIGHT
THEN THE TWILIGHT OBSCURITY CLOSED IN AGAIN
AT INTERVALS DEEP AND DULL MUTTERINGS ALLOWED A JUDGMENT TO BE FORMED
AS TO THE QUANTITY OF THUNDER CONTAINED BY THE CLOUD
TWENTY MONTHS HAD BARELY ELAPSED SINCE THE REVOLUTION OF JULY THE YEAR
1832 HAD OPENED WITH AN ASPECT OF SOMETHING IMPENDING AND THREATENING
THE DISTRESS OF THE PEOPLE THE LABORERS WITHOUT BREAD THE LAST PRINCE
DE CONDE ENGULFED IN THE SHADOWS BRUSSELS EXPELLING THE NASSAUS AS
PARIS DID THE BOURBONS BELGIUM OFFERING HERSELF TO A FRENCH PRINCE
AND GIVING HERSELF TO AN ENGLISH PRINCE THE RUSSIAN HATRED OF NICOLAS

HURL HERSELF ON THAT WHICH SHOULD FALL THE PEERAGE SHELTERING ITSELF
BEHIND BECCARIA TO REFUSE FOUR HEADS TO THE LAW THE FLEURS DE LYS

KINGDOM THE ONE IN THE CITY OF THOUGHT THE OTHER IN THE CITY OF TOIL

THE SOUTH RENDERED FANATIC THE WEST TROUBLED THE DUCHESSE DE BERRY IN
LA VENDEE PLOTS CONSPIRACIES RISINGS CHOLERA ADDED THE SOMBRE ROAR
OF TUMULT OF EVENTS TO THE SOMBRE ROAR OF IDEAS
CHAPTER V FACTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORES
TOWARDS THE END OF APRIL EVERYTHING HAD BECOME AGGRAVATED
THE
FERMENTATION ENTERED THE BOILING STATE
EVER SINCE 1830 PETTY PARTIAL
REVOLTS HAD BEEN GOING ON HERE AND THERE WHICH WERE QUICKLY SUPPRESSED
BUT EVER BURSTING FORTH AFRESH THE SIGN OF A VAST UNDERLYING
CONFLAGRATION
SOMETHING TERRIBLE WAS IN PREPARATION
GLIMPSES COULD BE
CAUGHT OF THE FEATURES STILL INDISTINCT AND IMPERFECTLY LIGHTED OF A
POSSIBLE REVOLUTION
FRANCE KEPT AN EYE ON PARIS PARIS KEPT AN EYE ON
THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE
THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE WHICH WAS IN A DULL GLOW WAS BEGINNING ITS
EBULLITION
ILLUSTRATION A STREET ORATOR 4B1 5 STREET ORATOR
THE WINE SHOPS OF THE RUE DE CHARONNE WERE ALTHOUGH THE UNION OF
THE TWO EPITHETS SEEMS SINGULAR WHEN APPLIED TO WINE SHOPS GRAVE AND
STORMY
THE GOVERNMENT WAS THERE PURELY AND SIMPLY CALLED IN QUESTION
THERE
PEOPLE PUBLICLY DISCUSSED THE QUESTION OF FIGHTING OR OF KEEPING QUIET
THERE WERE BACK SHOPS WHERE WORKINGMEN WERE MADE TO SWEAR THAT THEY
WOULD HASTEN INTO THE STREET AT THE FIRST CRY OF ALARM AND THAT THEY
WOULD FIGHT WITHOUT COUNTING THE NUMBER OF THE ENEMY THIS ENGAGEMENT
ONCE ENTERED INTO A MAN SEATED IN THE CORNER OF THE WINE SHOP ASSUMED
A SONOROUS TONE AND SAID YOU UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE SWORN
SOMETIMES THEY WENT UP STAIRS TO A PRIVATE ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR
AND THERE SCENES THAT WERE ALMOST MASONIC WERE ENACTED
THEY MADE THE
INITIATED TAKE OATHS TO RENDER SERVICE TO HIMSELF AS WELL AS TO THE
FATHERS OF FAMILIES
THAT WAS THE FORMULA
IN THE TAP ROOMS SUBVERSIVE PAMPHLETS WERE READ
THEY TREATED THE
GOVERNMENT WITH CONTEMPT SAYS A SECRET REPORT OF THAT TIME
WORDS LIKE THE FOLLOWING COULD BE HEARD THERE
I DON'T KNOW THE NAMES OF THE LEADERS
WE FOLKS SHALL NOT KNOW THE DAY
UNTIL TWO HOURS BEFOREHAND ONE WORKMAN SAID THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED
OF US LET EACH CONTRIBUTE TEN SOUS THAT WILL MAKE ONE HUNDRED AND
FIFTY FRANCS WITH WHICH TO PROCURE POWDER AND SHOT
ANOTHER SAID I DON'T ASK FOR SIX MONTHS I DON'T ASK FOR EVEN TWO
IN LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT WE SHALL BE PARALLEL WITH THE GOVERNMENT
WITH
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN WE CAN FACE THEM ANOTHER SAID I DON'T SLEEP
AT NIGHT BECAUSE I MAKE CARTRIDGES ALL NIGHT FROM TIME TO TIME
MEN OF BOURGEOIS APPEARANCE AND IN GOOD COATS CAME AND CAUSED
EMBARRASSMENT AND WITH THE AIR OF COMMAND SHOOK HANDS WITH THE MOST
IMPORTANT AND THEN WENT AWAY
THEY NEVER STAYED MORE THAN TEN MINUTES
SIGNIFICANT REMARKS WERE EXCHANGED IN A LOW TONE THE PLOT IS RIPE THE
MATTER IS ARRANGED IT WAS MURMURED BY ALL WHO WERE THERE TO BORROW
THE VERY EXPRESSION OF ONE OF THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT
THE EXALTATION WAS
SUCH THAT ONE DAY A WORKINGMAN EXCLAIMED BEFORE THE WHOLE WINE SHOP
WE HAVE NO ARMS ONE OF HIS COMRADES REPLIED THE SOLDIERS HAVE
THUS PARODYING WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF THE FACT BONAPARTE'S PROCLAMATION
TO THE ARMY IN ITALY WHEN THEY HAD ANYTHING OF A MORE SECRET NATURE ON
HAND ADDS ONE REPORT THEY DID NOT COMMUNICATE IT TO EACH OTHER IT
IS NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY COULD CONCEAL AFTER WHAT THEY SAID
THESE REUNIONS WERE SOMETIMES PERIODICAL
AT CERTAIN ONES OF THEM THERE
WERE NEVER MORE THAN EIGHT OR TEN PERSONS PRESENT AND THEY WERE ALWAYS
THE SAME
IN OTHERS ANY ONE ENTERED WHO WISHED AND THE ROOM WAS
SO FULL THAT THEY WERE FORCED TO STAND
SOME WENT THITHER THROUGH
ENTHUSIASM AND PASSION OTHERS BECAUSE IT WAS ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR
WORK
AS DURING THE REVOLUTION THERE WERE PATRIOTIC WOMEN IN SOME OF
THESE WINE SHOPS WHO EMBRACED NEW COMERS
OTHER EXPRESSIVE FACTS CAME TO LIGHT
A MAN WOULD ENTER A SHOP DRINK AND GO HIS WAY WITH THE REMARK
WINE MERCHANT THE REVOLUTION WILL PAY WHAT IS DUE TO YOU
REVOLUTIONARY AGENTS WERE APPOINTED IN A WINE SHOP FACING THE RUE DE
CHARONNE
THE BALLOTING WAS CARRIED ON IN THEIR CAPS
WORKINGMEN MET AT THE HOUSE OF A FENCING MASTER WHO GAVE LESSONS IN
THE RUE DE COTTE
THERE THERE WAS A TROPHY OF ARMS FORMED OF WOODEN
BROADSWORDS CANES CLUBS AND FOILS
ONE DAY THE BUTTONS WERE REMOVED
FROM THE FOILS
A WORKMAN SAID THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE OF US BUT THEY DON'T COUNT
ON ME BECAUSE I AM LOOKED UPON AS A MACHINE LATER ON THAT MACHINE
BECAME QUENISSET
THE INDEFINITE THINGS WHICH WERE BREWING GRADUALLY ACQUIRED A STRANGE
AND INDESCRIBABLE NOTORIETY
A WOMAN SWEEPING OFF HER DOORSTEPS SAID
TO ANOTHER WOMAN FOR A LONG TIME THERE HAS BEEN A STRONG FORCE BUSY
MAKING CARTRIDGES IN THE OPEN STREET PROCLAMATION COULD BE SEEN
ADDRESSED TO THE NATIONAL GUARD IN THE DEPARTMENTS
ONE OF THESE
PROCLAMATIONS WAS SIGNED BURTOT WINE MERCHANT
ONE DAY A MAN WITH HIS BEARD WORN LIKE A COLLAR AND WITH AN ITALIAN
ACCENT MOUNTED A STONE POST AT THE DOOR OF A LIQUOR SELLER IN THE MARCHE
LENOIR AND READ ALOUD A SINGULAR DOCUMENT WHICH SEEMED TO EMANATE FROM
AN OCCULT POWER
GROUPS FORMED AROUND HIM AND APPLAUDED
THE PASSAGES WHICH TOUCHED THE CROWD MOST DEEPLY WERE COLLECTED AND
NOTED DOWN
OUR DOCTRINES ARE TRAMMELLED OUR PROCLAMATIONS TORN OUR
BILL STICKERS ARE SPIED UPON AND THROWN INTO PRISON THE BREAKDOWN
WHICH HAS RECENTLY TAKEN PLACE IN COTTONS HAS CONVERTED TO US MANY
MEDIUMS THE FUTURE OF NATIONS IS BEING WORKED OUT IN OUR OBSCURE
RANKS HERE ARE THE FIXED TERMS ACTION OR REACTION REVOLUTION OR
COUNTER REVOLUTION
FOR AT OUR EPOCH WE NO LONGER BELIEVE EITHER IN
INERTIA OR IN IMMOBILITY
FOR THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE PEOPLE THAT IS THE
QUESTION
THERE IS NO OTHER ON THE DAY WHEN WE CEASE TO SUIT YOU
BREAK US BUT UP TO THAT DAY HELP US TO MARCH ON ALL THIS IN BROAD
DAYLIGHT
OTHER DEEDS MORE AUDACIOUS STILL WERE SUSPICIOUS IN THE EYES OF THE
PEOPLE BY REASON OF THEIR VERY AUDACITY
ON THE 4TH OF APRIL 1832 A
PASSER BY MOUNTED THE POST ON THE CORNER WHICH FORMS THE ANGLE OF THE
RUE SAINTE MARGUERITE AND SHOUTED I AM A BABOUVIST BUT BENEATH
BABEUF THE PEOPLE SCENTED GISQUET
AMONG OTHER THINGS THIS MAN SAID
DOWN WITH PROPERTY THE OPPOSITION OF THE LEFT IS COWARDLY AND
TREACHEROUS
WHEN IT WANTS TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IT PREACHES
REVOLUTION IT IS DEMOCRATIC IN ORDER TO ESCAPE BEING BEATEN AND
ROYALIST SO THAT IT MAY NOT HAVE TO FIGHT
THE REPUBLICANS ARE BEASTS
WITH FEATHERS
DISTRUST THE REPUBLICANS CITIZENS OF THE LABORING
CLASSES
SILENCE CITIZEN SPY CRIED AN ARTISAN
THIS SHOUT PUT AN END TO THE DISCOURSE
MYSTERIOUS INCIDENTS OCCURRED
AT NIGHTFALL A WORKINGMAN ENCOUNTERED NEAR THE CANAL A VERY WELL
DRESSED MAN WHO SAID TO HIM WHITHER ARE YOU BOUND CITIZEN SIR
REPLIED THE WORKINGMAN I HAVE NOT THE HONOR OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE I
KNOW YOU VERY WELL HOWEVER AND THE MAN ADDED DON'T BE ALARMED I
AM AN AGENT OF THE COMMITTEE
YOU ARE SUSPECTED OF NOT BEING QUITE
FAITHFUL
YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU REVEAL ANYTHING THERE IS AN EYE FIXED ON
YOU THEN HE SHOOK HANDS WITH THE WORKINGMAN AND WENT AWAY SAYING WE
SHALL MEET AGAIN SOON
THE POLICE WHO WERE ON THE ALERT COLLECTED SINGULAR DIALOGUES NOT
ONLY IN THE WINE SHOPS BUT IN THE STREET
GET YOURSELF RECEIVED VERY SOON SAID A WEAVER TO A CABINET MAKER
WHY
THERE IS GOING TO BE A SHOT TO FIRE
TWO RAGGED PEDESTRIANS EXCHANGED THESE REMARKABLE REPLIES FRAUGHT WITH
EVIDENT JACQUERIE
WHO GOVERNS US
M
PHILIPPE
NO IT IS THE BOURGEOISIE
THE READER IS MISTAKEN IF HE THINKS THAT WE TAKE THE WORD JACQUERIE IN A
BAD SENSE
THE JACQUES WERE THE POOR
ON ANOTHER OCCASION TWO MEN WERE HEARD TO SAY TO EACH OTHER AS THEY
PASSED BY WE HAVE A GOOD PLAN OF ATTACK
ONLY THE FOLLOWING WAS CAUGHT OF A PRIVATE CONVERSATION BETWEEN FOUR MEN
WHO WERE CROUCHING IN A DITCH OF THE CIRCLE OF THE BARRIERE DU TRONE
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE WILL BE DONE TO PREVENT HIS WALKING ABOUT PARIS ANY
MORE
WHO WAS THE HE MENACING OBSCURITY
THE PRINCIPAL LEADERS AS THEY SAID IN THE FAUBOURG HELD THEMSELVES
APART
IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT THEY MET FOR CONSULTATION IN A WINE SHOP
NEAR THE POINT SAINT EUSTACHE
A CERTAIN AUG CHIEF OF THE SOCIETY
AID FOR TAILORS RUE MONDETOUR HAD THE REPUTATION OF SERVING AS
INTERMEDIARY CENTRAL BETWEEN THE LEADERS AND THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE
NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS ALWAYS A GREAT DEAL OF MYSTERY ABOUT THESE
LEADERS AND NO CERTAIN FACT CAN INVALIDATE THE SINGULAR ARROGANCE OF
THIS REPLY MADE LATER ON BY A MAN ACCUSED BEFORE THE COURT OF PEERS
WHO WAS YOUR LEADER
I KNEW OF NONE AND I RECOGNIZED NONE
THERE WAS NOTHING BUT WORDS TRANSPARENT BUT VAGUE SOMETIMES IDLE
REPORTS RUMORS HEARSAY
OTHER INDICATIONS CROPPED UP
A CARPENTER OCCUPIED IN NAILING BOARDS TO A FENCE AROUND THE GROUND
ON WHICH A HOUSE WAS IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION IN THE RUE DE REUILLY
FOUND ON THAT PLOT THE TORN FRAGMENT OF A LETTER ON WHICH WERE STILL
LEGIBLE THE FOLLOWING LINES
THE COMMITTEE MUST TAKE MEASURES TO PREVENT RECRUITING IN THE SECTIONS
FOR THE DIFFERENT SOCIETIES
AND AS A POSTSCRIPT
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THERE ARE GUNS IN THE RUE DU FAUBOURG POISSONNIERE
NO
5 BIS TO THE NUMBER OF FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND IN THE HOUSE OF A
GUNSMITH IN THAT COURT
THE SECTION OWNS NO ARMS
WHAT EXCITED THE CARPENTER AND CAUSED HIM TO SHOW THIS THING TO HIS
NEIGHBORS WAS THE FACT THAT A FEW PACES FURTHER ON HE PICKED UP ANOTHER
PAPER TORN LIKE THE FIRST AND STILL MORE SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH WE
REPRODUCE A FACSIMILE BECAUSE OF THE HISTORICAL INTEREST ATTACHING TO
THESE STRANGE DOCUMENTS

IT APPEARS THAT THIS LIST WAS THE COMPLETE NOMENCLATURE OF
THE SECTIONS OF THE FOURTH ARONDISSEMENT OF THE SOCIETY OF THE RIGHTS
OF MAN WITH THE NAMES AND DWELLINGS OF THE CHIEFS OF SECTIONS
TO DAY
WHEN ALL THESE FACTS WHICH WERE OBSCURE ARE NOTHING MORE THAN HISTORY
WE MAY PUBLISH THEM
IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THE FOUNDATION OF THE
SOCIETY OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN POSTERIOR TO THE DATE
WHEN THIS PAPER WAS FOUND
PERHAPS THIS WAS ONLY A ROUGH DRAFT
STILL ACCORDING TO ALL THE REMARKS AND THE WORDS ACCORDING TO WRITTEN
NOTES MATERIAL FACTS BEGIN TO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE
IN THE RUE POPINCOURT IN THE HOUSE OF A DEALER IN BRIC ABRAC THERE
WERE SEIZED SEVEN SHEETS OF GRAY PAPER ALL FOLDED ALIKE LENGTHWISE
AND IN FOUR THESE SHEETS ENCLOSED TWENTY SIX SQUARES OF THIS SAME
GRAY PAPER FOLDED IN THE FORM OF A CARTRIDGE AND A CARD ON WHICH WAS
WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING
SALTPETRE
12 OUNCES
SULPHUR
2 OUNCES
CHARCOAL
2 OUNCES AND A HALF
WATER
2 OUNCES
THE REPORT OF THE SEIZURE STATED THAT THE DRAWER EXHALED A STRONG SMELL
OF POWDER
A MASON RETURNING FROM HIS DAY'S WORK LEFT BEHIND HIM A LITTLE PACKAGE
ON A BENCH NEAR THE BRIDGE OF AUSTERLITZ
THIS PACKAGE WAS TAKEN TO
THE POLICE STATION
IT WAS OPENED AND IN IT WERE FOUND TWO PRINTED
DIALOGUES SIGNED LAHAUTIERE A SONG ENTITLED WORKMEN BAND TOGETHER
AND A TIN BOX FULL OF CARTRIDGES
ONE ARTISAN DRINKING WITH A COMRADE MADE THE LATTER FEEL HIM TO SEE HOW
WARM HE WAS THE OTHER MAN FELT A PISTOL UNDER HIS WAISTCOAT
IN A DITCH ON THE BOULEVARD BETWEEN PERE LACHAISE AND THE BARRIERE
DU TRONE AT THE MOST DESERTED SPOT SOME CHILDREN WHILE PLAYING
DISCOVERED BENEATH A MASS OF SHAVINGS AND REFUSE BITS OF WOOD A
BAG CONTAINING A BULLET MOULD A WOODEN PUNCH FOR THE PREPARATION OF
CARTRIDGES A WOODEN BOWL IN WHICH THERE WERE GRAINS OF HUNTING POWDER
AND A LITTLE CAST IRON POT WHOSE INTERIOR PRESENTED EVIDENT TRACES OF
MELTED LEAD
POLICE AGENTS MAKING THEIR WAY SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AT FIVE
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING INTO THE DWELLING OF A CERTAIN PARDON WHO
WAS AFTERWARDS A MEMBER OF THE BARRICADE MERRY SECTION AND GOT HIMSELF
KILLED IN THE INSURRECTION OF APRIL 1834 FOUND HIM STANDING NEAR HIS
BED AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND SOME CARTRIDGES WHICH HE WAS IN THE ACT OF
PREPARING
TOWARDS THE HOUR WHEN WORKINGMEN REPOSE TWO MEN WERE SEEN TO MEET
BETWEEN THE BARRIERE PICPUS AND THE BARRIERE CHARENTON IN A LITTLE LANE
BETWEEN TWO WALLS NEAR A WINE SHOP IN FRONT OF WHICH THERE WAS A JEU
DE SIAM 33 ONE DREW A PISTOL FROM BENEATH HIS BLOUSE AND HANDED IT TO
THE OTHER
AS HE WAS HANDING IT TO HIM HE NOTICED THAT THE PERSPIRATION
OF HIS CHEST HAD MADE THE POWDER DAMP
HE PRIMED THE PISTOL AND ADDED
MORE POWDER TO WHAT WAS ALREADY IN THE PAN
THEN THE TWO MEN PARTED
A CERTAIN GALLAIS AFTERWARDS KILLED IN THE RUE BEAUBOURG IN THE AFFAIR
OF APRIL BOASTED OF HAVING IN HIS HOUSE SEVEN HUNDRED CARTRIDGES AND
TWENTY FOUR FLINTS
THE GOVERNMENT ONE DAY RECEIVED A WARNING THAT ARMS AND TWO HUNDRED
THOUSAND CARTRIDGES HAD JUST BEEN DISTRIBUTED IN THE FAUBOURG
ON
THE FOLLOWING WEEK THIRTY THOUSAND CARTRIDGES WERE DISTRIBUTED
THE
REMARKABLE POINT ABOUT IT WAS THAT THE POLICE WERE NOT ABLE TO SEIZE A
SINGLE ONE
AN INTERCEPTED LETTER READ THE DAY IS NOT FAR DISTANT WHEN WITHIN
FOUR HOURS BY THE CLOCK EIGHTY THOUSAND PATRIOTS WILL BE UNDER ARMS
ALL THIS FERMENTATION WAS PUBLIC ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY TRANQUIL
THE
APPROACHING INSURRECTION WAS PREPARING ITS STORM CALMLY IN THE FACE OF
THE GOVERNMENT
NO SINGULARITY WAS LACKING TO THIS STILL SUBTERRANEAN
CRISIS WHICH WAS ALREADY PERCEPTIBLE
THE BOURGEOIS TALKED PEACEABLY TO
THE WORKING CLASSES OF WHAT WAS IN PREPARATION
THEY SAID HOW IS THE
RISING COMING ALONG IN THE SAME TONE IN WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE SAID
HOW IS YOUR WIFE
A FURNITURE DEALER OF THE RUE MOREAU INQUIRED WELL WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO MAKE THE ATTACK
ANOTHER SHOP KEEPER SAID
THE ATTACK WILL BE MADE SOON
I KNOW IT
A MONTH AGO THERE WERE FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF YOU NOW THERE
ARE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HE OFFERED HIS GUN AND A NEIGHBOR OFFERED A
SMALL PISTOL WHICH HE WAS WILLING TO SELL FOR SEVEN FRANCS
MOREOVER THE REVOLUTIONARY FEVER WAS GROWING
NOT A POINT IN PARIS NOR
IN FRANCE WAS EXEMPT FROM IT
THE ARTERY WAS BEATING EVERYWHERE
LIKE
THOSE MEMBRANES WHICH ARISE FROM CERTAIN INFLAMMATIONS AND FORM IN THE
HUMAN BODY THE NETWORK OF SECRET SOCIETIES BEGAN TO SPREAD ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY
FROM THE ASSOCIATIONS OF THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE WHICH WAS
AT THE SAME TIME PUBLIC AND SECRET SPRANG THE SOCIETY OF THE RIGHTS OF
MAN WHICH ALSO DATED FROM ONE OF THE ORDERS OF THE DAY PLUVIOSE YEAR
40 OF THE REPUBLICAN ERA WHICH WAS DESTINED TO SURVIVE EVEN THE MANDATE
OF THE COURT OF ASSIZES WHICH PRONOUNCED ITS DISSOLUTION AND WHICH
DID NOT HESITATE TO BESTOW ON ITS SECTIONS SIGNIFICANT NAMES LIKE THE
FOLLOWING
PIKES
TOCSIN
SIGNAL CANNON
PHRYGIAN CAP
JANUARY 21
THE BEGGARS
THE VAGABONDS
FORWARD MARCH
ROBESPIERRE
LEVEL
CA IRA
THE SOCIETY OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN ENGENDERED THE SOCIETY OF ACTION
THESE
WERE IMPATIENT INDIVIDUALS WHO BROKE AWAY AND HASTENED AHEAD
OTHER
ASSOCIATIONS SOUGHT TO RECRUIT THEMSELVES FROM THE GREAT MOTHER
SOCIETIES
THE MEMBERS OF SECTIONS COMPLAINED THAT THEY WERE TORN
ASUNDER
THUS THE GALLIC SOCIETY AND THE COMMITTEE OF ORGANIZATION OF
THE MUNICIPALITIES
THUS THE ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS
FOR INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF THE PEOPLE AGAINST
INDIRECT TAXES
THEN THE SOCIETY OF EQUAL WORKINGMEN WHICH WAS DIVIDED
INTO THREE FRACTIONS THE LEVELLERS THE COMMUNISTS THE REFORMERS
THEN THE ARMY OF THE BASTILLES A SORT OF COHORT ORGANIZED ON A MILITARY
FOOTING FOUR MEN COMMANDED BY A CORPORAL TEN BY A SERGEANT TWENTY BY
A SUB LIEUTENANT FORTY BY A LIEUTENANT THERE WERE NEVER MORE THAN
FIVE MEN WHO KNEW EACH OTHER
CREATION WHERE PRECAUTION IS COMBINED WITH
AUDACITY AND WHICH SEEMED STAMPED WITH THE GENIUS OF VENICE
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE WHICH WAS AT THE HEAD HAD TWO ARMS THE SOCIETY
OF ACTION AND THE ARMY OF THE BASTILLES
A LEGITIMIST ASSOCIATION THE CHEVALIERS OF FIDELITY STIRRED ABOUT
AMONG THESE THE REPUBLICAN AFFILIATIONS
IT WAS DENOUNCED AND REPUDIATED
THERE
THE PARISIAN SOCIETIES HAD RAMIFICATIONS IN THE PRINCIPAL CITIES LYONS
NANTES LILLE MARSEILLES AND EACH HAD ITS SOCIETY OF THE RIGHTS OF
MAN THE CHARBONNIERE AND THE FREE MEN
ALL HAD A REVOLUTIONARY SOCIETY
WHICH WAS CALLED THE COUGOURDE
WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THIS WORD
IN PARIS THE FAUBOURG SAINT MARCEAU KEPT UP AN EQUAL BUZZING WITH THE
FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE AND THE SCHOOLS WERE NO LESS MOVED THAN THE
FAUBOURGS
A CAFE IN THE RUE SAINT HYACINTHE AND THE WINE SHOP OF THE
SEVEN BILLIARDS RUE DES MATHURINS SAINT JACQUES SERVED AS RALLYING
POINTS FOR THE STUDENTS
THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C
AFFILIATED TO THE MUTUALISTS OF ANGERS AND TO THE COUGOURDE OF AIX
MET AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE CAFE MUSAIN
THESE SAME YOUNG MEN ASSEMBLED
ALSO AS WE HAVE STATED ALREADY IN A RESTAURANT WINE SHOP OF THE RUE
MONDETOUR WHICH WAS CALLED CORINTHE
THESE MEETINGS WERE SECRET
OTHERS
WERE AS PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE AND THE READER CAN JUDGE OF THEIR BOLDNESS
FROM THESE FRAGMENTS OF AN INTERROGATORY UNDERGONE IN ONE OF THE
ULTERIOR PROSECUTIONS WHERE WAS THIS MEETING HELD IN THE RUE DE LA
PAIX AT WHOSE HOUSE IN THE STREET WHAT SECTIONS WERE THERE
ONLY ONE WHICH THE MANUEL SECTION WHO WAS ITS LEADER
I YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO HAVE DECIDED ALONE UPON THE BOLD COURSE OF
ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT
WHERE DID YOUR INSTRUCTIONS COME FROM FROM
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE
THE ARMY WAS MINED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE POPULATION AS WAS PROVED
SUBSEQUENTLY BY THE OPERATIONS OF BEFORD LUNEVILLE AND EPINARD
THEY
COUNTED ON THE FIFTY SECOND REGIMENT ON THE FIFTH ON THE EIGHTH ON
THE THIRTY SEVENTH AND ON THE TWENTIETH LIGHT CAVALRY
IN BURGUNDY AND
IN THE SOUTHERN TOWNS THEY PLANTED THE LIBERTY TREE THAT IS TO SAY A
POLE SURMOUNTED BY A RED CAP
SUCH WAS THE SITUATION
THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP OF THE POPULATION
AS WE STATED IN THE BEGINNING ACCENTUATED THIS SITUATION AND MADE
IT FELT
THAT WAS THE SORE POINT
THIS OLD FAUBOURG PEOPLED LIKE
AN ANT HILL LABORIOUS COURAGEOUS AND ANGRY AS A HIVE OF BEES WAS
QUIVERING WITH EXPECTATION AND WITH THE DESIRE FOR A TUMULT
EVERYTHING
WAS IN A STATE OF AGITATION THERE WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION HOWEVER OF
THE REGULAR WORK
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY AN IDEA OF THIS LIVELY YET
SOMBRE PHYSIOGNOMY
IN THIS FAUBOURG EXISTS POIGNANT DISTRESS HIDDEN
UNDER ATTIC ROOFS THERE ALSO EXIST RARE AND ARDENT MINDS
IT IS
PARTICULARLY IN THE MATTER OF DISTRESS AND INTELLIGENCE THAT IT IS
DANGEROUS TO HAVE EXTREMES MEET
THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE HAD ALSO OTHER CAUSES TO TREMBLE FOR IT
RECEIVED THE COUNTER SHOCK OF COMMERCIAL CRISES OF FAILURES STRIKES
SLACK SEASONS ALL INHERENT TO GREAT POLITICAL DISTURBANCES
IN TIMES
OF REVOLUTION MISERY IS BOTH CAUSE AND EFFECT
THE BLOW WHICH IT DEALS
REBOUNDS UPON IT
THIS POPULATION FULL OF PROUD VIRTUE CAPABLE TO THE
HIGHEST DEGREE OF LATENT HEAT ALWAYS READY TO FLY TO ARMS PROMPT TO
EXPLODE IRRITATED DEEP UNDERMINED SEEMED TO BE ONLY AWAITING THE
FALL OF A SPARK
WHENEVER CERTAIN SPARKS FLOAT ON THE HORIZON CHASED
BY THE WIND OF EVENTS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO THINK OF THE FAUBOURG
SAINT ANTOINE AND OF THE FORMIDABLE CHANCE WHICH HAS PLACED AT THE VERY
GATES OF PARIS THAT POWDER HOUSE OF SUFFERING AND IDEAS
THE WINE SHOPS OF THE FAUBOURG ANTOINE WHICH HAVE BEEN MORE THAN
ONCE DRAWN IN THE SKETCHES WHICH THE READER HAS JUST PERUSED POSSESS
HISTORICAL NOTORIETY
IN TROUBLOUS TIMES PEOPLE GROW INTOXICATED THERE
MORE ON WORDS THAN ON WINE
A SORT OF PROPHETIC SPIRIT AND AN AFFLATUS
OF THE FUTURE CIRCULATES THERE SWELLING HEARTS AND ENLARGING SOULS
THE
CABARETS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE RESEMBLE THOSE TAVERNS OF MONT
AVENTINE ERECTED ON THE CAVE OF THE SIBYL AND COMMUNICATING WITH
THE PROFOUND AND SACRED BREATH TAVERNS WHERE THE TABLES WERE ALMOST
TRIPODS AND WHERE WAS DRUNK WHAT ENNIUS CALLS THE SIBYLLINE WINE
THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE IS A RESERVOIR OF PEOPLE
REVOLUTIONARY
AGITATIONS CREATE FISSURES THERE THROUGH WHICH TRICKLES THE POPULAR
SOVEREIGNTY
THIS SOVEREIGNTY MAY DO EVIL IT CAN BE MISTAKEN LIKE ANY
OTHER BUT EVEN WHEN LED ASTRAY IT REMAINS GREAT
WE MAY SAY OF IT AS
OF THE BLIND CYCLOPS INGENS
IN '93 ACCORDING AS THE IDEA WHICH WAS FLOATING ABOUT WAS GOOD OR EVIL
ACCORDING AS IT WAS THE DAY OF FANATICISM OR OF ENTHUSIASM THERE LEAPED
FORTH FROM THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE NOW SAVAGE LEGIONS NOW HEROIC
BANDS
SAVAGE
LET US EXPLAIN THIS WORD
WHEN THESE BRISTLING MEN WHO IN THE
EARLY DAYS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY CHAOS TATTERED HOWLING WILD WITH
UPLIFTED BLUDGEON PIKE ON HIGH HURLED THEMSELVES UPON ANCIENT PARIS IN
AN UPROAR WHAT DID THEY WANT THEY WANTED AN END TO OPPRESSION AN
END TO TYRANNY AN END TO THE SWORD WORK FOR MEN INSTRUCTION FOR THE
CHILD SOCIAL SWEETNESS FOR THE WOMAN LIBERTY EQUALITY FRATERNITY
BREAD FOR ALL THE IDEA FOR ALL THE EDENIZING OF THE WORLD
PROGRESS
AND THAT HOLY SWEET AND GOOD THING PROGRESS THEY CLAIMED IN TERRIBLE
WISE DRIVEN TO EXTREMITIES AS THEY WERE HALF NAKED CLUB IN FIST
A ROAR IN THEIR MOUTHS
THEY WERE SAVAGES YES BUT THE SAVAGES OF
CIVILIZATION
THEY PROCLAIMED RIGHT FURIOUSLY THEY WERE DESIROUS IF ONLY WITH
FEAR AND TREMBLING TO FORCE THE HUMAN RACE TO PARADISE
THEY SEEMED
BARBARIANS AND THEY WERE SAVIOURS
THEY DEMANDED LIGHT WITH THE MASK OF
NIGHT
FACING THESE MEN WHO WERE FEROCIOUS WE ADMIT AND TERRIFYING BUT
FEROCIOUS AND TERRIFYING FOR GOOD ENDS THERE ARE OTHER MEN SMILING
EMBROIDERED GILDED BERIBBONED STARRED IN SILK STOCKINGS IN WHITE
PLUMES IN YELLOW GLOVES IN VARNISHED SHOES WHO WITH THEIR ELBOWS ON
A VELVET TABLE BESIDE A MARBLE CHIMNEY PIECE INSIST GENTLY ON DEMEANOR
AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE PAST OF THE MIDDLE AGES OF DIVINE RIGHT
OF FANATICISM OF INNOCENCE OF SLAVERY OF THE DEATH PENALTY OF WAR
GLORIFYING IN LOW TONES AND WITH POLITENESS THE SWORD THE STAKE AND
THE SCAFFOLD
FOR OUR PART IF WE WERE FORCED TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN
THE BARBARIANS OF CIVILIZATION AND THE CIVILIZED MEN OF BARBARISM WE
SHOULD CHOOSE THE BARBARIANS
BUT THANK HEAVEN STILL ANOTHER CHOICE IS POSSIBLE
NO PERPENDICULAR
FALL IS NECESSARY IN FRONT ANY MORE THAN IN THE REAR
NEITHER DESPOTISM NOR TERRORISM
WE DESIRE PROGRESS WITH A GENTLE SLOPE
GOD TAKES CARE OF THAT

CHAPTER VI ENJOLRAS AND HIS LIEUTENANTS
IT WAS ABOUT THIS EPOCH THAT ENJOLRAS IN VIEW OF A POSSIBLE
CATASTROPHE INSTITUTED A KIND OF MYSTERIOUS CENSUS
ALL WERE PRESENT AT A SECRET MEETING AT THE CAFE MUSAIN
ENJOLRAS SAID MIXING HIS WORDS WITH A FEW HALF ENIGMATICAL BUT
SIGNIFICANT METAPHORS
IT IS PROPER THAT WE SHOULD KNOW WHERE WE STAND AND ON WHOM WE MAY
COUNT
IF COMBATANTS ARE REQUIRED THEY MUST BE PROVIDED
IT CAN DO NO
HARM TO HAVE SOMETHING WITH WHICH TO STRIKE
PASSERS BY ALWAYS HAVE MORE
CHANCE OF BEING GORED WHEN THERE ARE BULLS ON THE ROAD THAN WHEN THERE
ARE NONE
LET US THEREFORE RECKON A LITTLE ON THE HERD
HOW MANY OF US
ARE THERE THERE IS NO QUESTION OF POSTPONING THIS TASK UNTIL TO MORROW
REVOLUTIONISTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE HURRIED PROGRESS HAS NO TIME TO LOSE
LET US MISTRUST THE UNEXPECTED
LET US NOT BE CAUGHT UNPREPARED
WE MUST
GO OVER ALL THE SEAMS THAT WE HAVE MADE AND SEE WHETHER THEY HOLD FAST
THIS BUSINESS OUGHT TO BE CONCLUDED TO DAY
COURFEYRAC YOU WILL SEE THE
POLYTECHNIC STUDENTS
IT IS THEIR DAY TO GO OUT
TO DAY IS WEDNESDAY
FEUILLY YOU WILL SEE THOSE OF THE GLACIERE WILL YOU NOT COMBEFERRE
HAS PROMISED ME TO GO TO PICPUS
THERE IS A PERFECT SWARM AND AN
EXCELLENT ONE THERE
BAHOREL WILL VISIT THE ESTRAPADE
PROUVAIRE THE
MASONS ARE GROWING LUKEWARM YOU WILL BRING US NEWS FROM THE LODGE OF
THE RUE DE GRENELLE SAINT HONORE
JOLY WILL GO TO DUPUYTREN'S CLINICAL
LECTURE AND FEEL THE PULSE OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL
BOSSUET WILL TAKE A
LITTLE TURN IN THE COURT AND TALK WITH THE YOUNG LAW LICENTIATES
I WILL
TAKE CHARGE OF THE COUGOURDE MYSELF
THAT ARRANGES EVERYTHING SAID COURFEYRAC
NO
WHAT ELSE IS THERE
A VERY IMPORTANT THING
WHAT IS THAT ASKED COURFEYRAC
THE BARRIERE DU MAINE REPLIED ENJOLRAS
ENJOLRAS REMAINED FOR A MOMENT AS THOUGH ABSORBED IN REFLECTION THEN HE
RESUMED
AT THE BARRIERE DU MAINE THERE ARE MARBLE WORKERS PAINTERS AND
JOURNEYMEN IN THE STUDIOS OF SCULPTORS
THEY ARE AN ENTHUSIASTIC FAMILY
BUT LIABLE TO COOL OFF
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN THE MATTER WITH
THEM FOR SOME TIME PAST
THEY ARE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
THEY ARE
BECOMING EXTINGUISHED
THEY PASS THEIR TIME PLAYING DOMINOES
THERE IS
URGENT NEED THAT SOME ONE SHOULD GO AND TALK WITH THEM A LITTLE BUT
WITH FIRMNESS
THEY MEET AT RICHEFEU'S
THEY ARE TO BE FOUND THERE
BETWEEN TWELVE AND ONE O'CLOCK
THOSE ASHES MUST BE FANNED INTO A GLOW
FOR THAT ERRAND I HAD COUNTED ON THAT ABSTRACTED MARIUS WHO IS A GOOD
FELLOW ON THE WHOLE BUT HE NO LONGER COMES TO US
I NEED SOME ONE FOR
THE BARRIERE DU MAINE
I HAVE NO ONE
WHAT ABOUT ME SAID GRANTAIRE
HERE AM I
YOU
I
YOU INDOCTRINATE REPUBLICANS YOU WARM UP HEARTS THAT HAVE GROWN COLD
IN THE NAME OF PRINCIPLE
WHY NOT
ARE YOU GOOD FOR ANYTHING
I HAVE A VAGUE AMBITION IN THAT DIRECTION SAID GRANTAIRE
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING
I BELIEVE IN YOU
GRANTAIRE WILL YOU DO ME A SERVICE
ANYTHING
I'LL BLACK YOUR BOOTS
WELL DON'T MEDDLE WITH OUR AFFAIRS
SLEEP YOURSELF SOBER FROM YOUR
ABSINTHE
YOU ARE AN INGRATE ENJOLRAS
YOU THE MAN TO GO TO THE BARRIERE DU MAINE YOU CAPABLE OF IT
I AM CAPABLE OF DESCENDING THE RUE DE GRES OF CROSSING THE PLACE
SAINT MICHEL OF SLOPING THROUGH THE RUE MONSIEUR LE PRINCE OF TAKING
THE RUE DE VAUGIRARD OF PASSING THE CARMELITES OF TURNING INTO THE RUE
D'ASSAS OF REACHING THE RUE DU CHERCHE MIDI OF LEAVING BEHIND ME THE
CONSEIL DE GUERRE OF PACING THE RUE DES VIELLES TUILERIES OF STRIDING
ACROSS THE BOULEVARD OF FOLLOWING THE CHAUSSEE DU MAINE OF PASSING
THE BARRIER AND ENTERING RICHEFEU'S
I AM CAPABLE OF THAT
MY SHOES ARE
CAPABLE OF THAT
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THOSE COMRADES WHO MEET AT RICHEFEU'S
NOT MUCH
WE ONLY ADDRESS EACH OTHER AS THOU
WHAT WILL YOU SAY TO THEM
I WILL SPEAK TO THEM OF ROBESPIERRE PARDI OF DANTON
OF PRINCIPLES
YOU
I
BUT I DON'T RECEIVE JUSTICE
WHEN I SET ABOUT IT I AM TERRIBLE
I
HAVE READ PRUDHOMME I KNOW THE SOCIAL CONTRACT I KNOW MY CONSTITUTION
OF THE YEAR TWO BY HEART
'THE LIBERTY OF ONE CITIZEN ENDS WHERE THE
LIBERTY OF ANOTHER CITIZEN BEGINS DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A BRUTE I HAVE
AN OLD BANK BILL OF THE REPUBLIC IN MY DRAWER
THE RIGHTS OF MAN THE
SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE SAPRISTI I AM EVEN A BIT OF A HEBERTIST
I
CAN TALK THE MOST SUPERB TWADDLE FOR SIX HOURS BY THE CLOCK WATCH IN
HAND
BE SERIOUS SAID ENJOLRAS
I AM WILD REPLIED GRANTAIRE
ENJOLRAS MEDITATED FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND MADE THE GESTURE OF A MAN WHO
HAS TAKEN A RESOLUTION
GRANTAIRE HE SAID GRAVELY I CONSENT TO TRY YOU
YOU SHALL GO TO THE
BARRIERE DU MAINE
GRANTAIRE LIVED IN FURNISHED LODGINGS VERY NEAR THE CAFE MUSAIN
HE WENT
OUT AND FIVE MINUTES LATER HE RETURNED
HE HAD GONE HOME TO PUT ON A
ROBESPIERRE WAISTCOAT
RED SAID HE AS HE ENTERED AND HE LOOKED INTENTLY AT ENJOLRAS
THEN
WITH THE PALM OF HIS ENERGETIC HAND HE LAID THE TWO SCARLET POINTS OF
THE WAISTCOAT ACROSS HIS BREAST
AND STEPPING UP TO ENJOLRAS HE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
BE EASY
HE JAMMED HIS HAT ON RESOLUTELY AND DEPARTED
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFE MUSAIN WAS
DESERTED
ALL THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C WERE GONE EACH IN HIS OWN
DIRECTION EACH TO HIS OWN TASK
ENJOLRAS WHO HAD RESERVED THE
COUGOURDE OF AIX FOR HIMSELF WAS THE LAST TO LEAVE
THOSE MEMBERS OF THE COUGOURDE OF AIX WHO WERE IN PARIS THEN MET ON THE
PLAIN OF ISSY IN ONE OF THE ABANDONED QUARRIES WHICH ARE SO NUMEROUS IN
THAT SIDE OF PARIS
AS ENJOLRAS WALKED TOWARDS THIS PLACE HE PASSED THE WHOLE SITUATION
IN REVIEW IN HIS OWN MIND
THE GRAVITY OF EVENTS WAS SELF EVIDENT
WHEN
FACTS THE PREMONITORY SYMPTOMS OF LATENT SOCIAL MALADY MOVE HEAVILY
THE SLIGHTEST COMPLICATION STOPS AND ENTANGLES THEM
A PHENOMENON WHENCE
ARISES RUIN AND NEW BIRTHS
ENJOLRAS DESCRIED A LUMINOUS UPLIFTING
BENEATH THE GLOOMY SKIRTS OF THE FUTURE
WHO KNOWS PERHAPS THE MOMENT
WAS AT HAND
THE PEOPLE WERE AGAIN TAKING POSSESSION OF RIGHT AND
WHAT A FINE SPECTACLE THE REVOLUTION WAS AGAIN MAJESTICALLY TAKING
POSSESSION OF FRANCE AND SAYING TO THE WORLD THE SEQUEL TO MORROW
ENJOLRAS WAS CONTENT
THE FURNACE WAS BEING HEATED
HE HAD AT THAT
MOMENT A POWDER TRAIN OF FRIENDS SCATTERED ALL OVER PARIS
HE COMPOSED
IN HIS OWN MIND WITH COMBEFERRE'S PHILOSOPHICAL AND PENETRATING
ELOQUENCE FEUILLY'S COSMOPOLITAN ENTHUSIASM COURFEYRAC'S DASH
BAHOREL'S SMILE JEAN PROUVAIRE'S MELANCHOLY JOLY'S SCIENCE BOSSUET'S
SARCASMS A SORT OF ELECTRIC SPARK WHICH TOOK FIRE NEARLY EVERYWHERE AT
ONCE
ALL HANDS TO WORK
SURELY THE RESULT WOULD ANSWER TO THE EFFORT
THIS WAS WELL
THIS MADE HIM THINK OF GRANTAIRE
HOLD SAID HE TO HIMSELF THE BARRIERE DU MAINE WILL NOT TAKE ME FAR
OUT OF MY WAY
WHAT IF I WERE TO GO ON AS FAR AS RICHEFEU'S LET US HAVE
A LOOK AT WHAT GRANTAIRE IS ABOUT AND SEE HOW HE IS GETTING ON
ONE O'CLOCK WAS STRIKING FROM THE VAUGIRARD STEEPLE WHEN ENJOLRAS
REACHED THE RICHEFEU SMOKING ROOM
HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR ENTERED FOLDED HIS ARMS LETTING THE DOOR FALL
TO AND STRIKE HIS SHOULDERS AND GAZED AT THAT ROOM FILLED WITH TABLES
MEN AND SMOKE
A VOICE BROKE FORTH FROM THE MIST OF SMOKE INTERRUPTED BY ANOTHER
VOICE
IT WAS GRANTAIRE HOLDING A DIALOGUE WITH AN ADVERSARY
GRANTAIRE WAS SITTING OPPOSITE ANOTHER FIGURE AT A MARBLE SAINT ANNE
TABLE STREWN WITH GRAINS OF BRAN AND DOTTED WITH DOMINOS
HE WAS
HAMMERING THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST AND THIS IS WHAT ENJOLRAS HEARD

BOOK SECOND EPONINE
CHAPTER I THE LARK'S MEADOW
MARIUS HAD WITNESSED THE UNEXPECTED TERMINATION OF THE AMBUSH UPON WHOSE
TRACK HE HAD SET JAVERT BUT JAVERT HAD NO SOONER QUITTED THE BUILDING
BEARING OFF HIS PRISONERS IN THREE HACKNEY COACHES THAN MARIUS ALSO
GLIDED OUT OF THE HOUSE
IT WAS ONLY NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
MARIUS
BETOOK HIMSELF TO COURFEYRAC
COURFEYRAC WAS NO LONGER THE IMPERTURBABLE
INHABITANT OF THE LATIN QUARTER HE HAD GONE TO LIVE IN THE RUE DE LA
VERRERIE FOR POLITICAL REASONS THIS QUARTER WAS ONE WHERE AT THAT
EPOCH INSURRECTION LIKED TO INSTALL ITSELF
MARIUS SAID TO COURFEYRAC
I HAVE COME TO SLEEP WITH YOU COURFEYRAC DRAGGED A MATTRESS OFF HIS
BED WHICH WAS FURNISHED WITH TWO SPREAD IT OUT ON THE FLOOR AND SAID
THERE
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING MARIUS RETURNED TO THE HOVEL
PAID THE QUARTER'S RENT WHICH HE OWED TO MA'AM BOUGON HAD HIS BOOKS
HIS BED HIS TABLE HIS COMMODE AND HIS TWO CHAIRS LOADED ON A
HAND CART AND WENT OFF WITHOUT LEAVING HIS ADDRESS SO THAT WHEN JAVERT
RETURNED IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING FOR THE PURPOSE OF QUESTIONING
MARIUS AS TO THE EVENTS OF THE PRECEDING EVENING HE FOUND ONLY MA'AM
BOUGON WHO ANSWERED MOVED AWAY
MA'AM BOUGON WAS CONVINCED THAT MARIUS WAS TO SOME EXTENT AN ACCOMPLICE
OF THE ROBBERS WHO HAD BEEN SEIZED THE NIGHT BEFORE
WHO WOULD EVER
HAVE SAID IT SHE EXCLAIMED TO THE PORTRESSES OF THE QUARTER A YOUNG
MAN LIKE THAT WHO HAD THE AIR OF A GIRL
MARIUS HAD TWO REASONS FOR THIS PROMPT CHANGE OF RESIDENCE
THE FIRST
WAS THAT HE NOW HAD A HORROR OF THAT HOUSE WHERE HE HAD BEHELD SO
CLOSE AT HAND AND IN ITS MOST REPULSIVE AND MOST FEROCIOUS DEVELOPMENT
A SOCIAL DEFORMITY WHICH IS PERHAPS EVEN MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE WICKED
RICH MAN THE WICKED POOR MAN
THE SECOND WAS THAT HE DID NOT WISH
TO FIGURE IN THE LAWSUIT WHICH WOULD INSUE IN ALL PROBABILITY AND BE
BROUGHT IN TO TESTIFY AGAINST THENARDIER
JAVERT THOUGHT THAT THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE NAME HE HAD FORGOTTEN WAS
AFRAID AND HAD FLED OR PERHAPS HAD NOT EVEN RETURNED HOME AT THE TIME
OF THE AMBUSH HE MADE SOME EFFORTS TO FIND HIM HOWEVER BUT WITHOUT
SUCCESS
A MONTH PASSED THEN ANOTHER
MARIUS WAS STILL WITH COURFEYRAC
HE HAD
LEARNED FROM A YOUNG LICENTIATE IN LAW AN HABITUAL FREQUENTER OF THE
COURTS THAT THENARDIER WAS IN CLOSE CONFINEMENT
EVERY MONDAY
MARIUS HAD FIVE FRANCS HANDED IN TO THE CLERK'S OFFICE OF LA FORCE FOR
THENARDIER
AS MARIUS HAD NO LONGER ANY MONEY HE BORROWED THE FIVE FRANCS FROM
COURFEYRAC
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE THAT HE HAD EVER BORROWED
MONEY
THESE PERIODICAL FIVE FRANCS WERE A DOUBLE RIDDLE TO COURFEYRAC
WHO LENT AND TO THENARDIER WHO RECEIVED THEM
TO WHOM CAN THEY GO
THOUGHT COURFEYRAC
WHENCE CAN THIS COME TO ME THENARDIER ASKED
HIMSELF
MOREOVER MARIUS WAS HEART BROKEN
EVERYTHING HAD PLUNGED THROUGH A
TRAP DOOR ONCE MORE
HE NO LONGER SAW ANYTHING BEFORE HIM HIS LIFE
WAS AGAIN BURIED IN MYSTERY WHERE HE WANDERED FUMBLINGLY
HE HAD FOR A
MOMENT BEHELD VERY CLOSE AT HAND IN THAT OBSCURITY THE YOUNG GIRL WHOM
HE LOVED THE OLD MAN WHO SEEMED TO BE HER FATHER THOSE UNKNOWN BEINGS
WHO WERE HIS ONLY INTEREST AND HIS ONLY HOPE IN THIS WORLD AND AT THE
VERY MOMENT WHEN HE THOUGHT HIMSELF ON THE POINT OF GRASPING THEM A
GUST HAD SWEPT ALL THESE SHADOWS AWAY
NOT A SPARK OF CERTAINTY AND
TRUTH HAD BEEN EMITTED EVEN IN THE MOST TERRIBLE OF COLLISIONS
NO
CONJECTURE WAS POSSIBLE
HE NO LONGER KNEW EVEN THE NAME THAT HE THOUGHT
HE KNEW
IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT URSULE
AND THE LARK WAS A NICKNAME
AND
WHAT WAS HE TO THINK OF THE OLD MAN WAS HE ACTUALLY IN HIDING FROM
THE POLICE THE WHITE HAIRED WORKMAN WHOM MARIUS HAD ENCOUNTERED IN THE
VICINITY OF THE INVALIDES RECURRED TO HIS MIND
IT NOW SEEMED PROBABLE
THAT THAT WORKINGMAN AND M
LEBLANC WERE ONE AND THE SAME PERSON
SO HE
DISGUISED HIMSELF THAT MAN HAD HIS HEROIC AND HIS EQUIVOCAL SIDES
WHY
HAD HE NOT CALLED FOR HELP WHY HAD HE FLED WAS HE OR WAS HE NOT
THE FATHER OF THE YOUNG GIRL WAS HE IN SHORT THE MAN WHOM THENARDIER
THOUGHT THAT HE RECOGNIZED THENARDIER MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
THESE
FORMED SO MANY INSOLUBLE PROBLEMS
ALL THIS IT IS TRUE DETRACTED
NOTHING FROM THE ANGELIC CHARMS OF THE YOUNG GIRL OF THE LUXEMBOURG
HEART RENDING DISTRESS MARIUS BORE A PASSION IN HIS HEART AND NIGHT
OVER HIS EYES
HE WAS THRUST ONWARD HE WAS DRAWN AND HE COULD NOT
STIR
ALL HAD VANISHED SAVE LOVE
OF LOVE ITSELF HE HAD LOST THE
INSTINCTS AND THE SUDDEN ILLUMINATIONS
ORDINARILY THIS FLAME WHICH
BURNS US LIGHTS US ALSO A LITTLE AND CASTS SOME USEFUL GLEAMS WITHOUT
BUT MARIUS NO LONGER EVEN HEARD THESE MUTE COUNSELS OF PASSION
HE NEVER
SAID TO HIMSELF WHAT IF I WERE TO GO TO SUCH A PLACE WHAT IF I WERE
TO TRY SUCH AND SUCH A THING THE GIRL WHOM HE COULD NO LONGER CALL
URSULE WAS EVIDENTLY SOMEWHERE NOTHING WARNED MARIUS IN WHAT DIRECTION
HE SHOULD SEEK HER
HIS WHOLE LIFE WAS NOW SUMMED UP IN TWO WORDS
ABSOLUTE UNCERTAINTY WITHIN AN IMPENETRABLE FOG
TO SEE HER ONCE AGAIN
HE STILL ASPIRED TO THIS BUT HE NO LONGER EXPECTED IT
TO CROWN ALL HIS POVERTY HAD RETURNED
HE FELT THAT ICY BREATH CLOSE TO
HIM ON HIS HEELS
IN THE MIDST OF HIS TORMENTS AND LONG BEFORE
THIS HE HAD DISCONTINUED HIS WORK AND NOTHING IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN
DISCONTINUED WORK IT IS A HABIT WHICH VANISHES
A HABIT WHICH IS EASY
TO GET RID OF AND DIFFICULT TO TAKE UP AGAIN
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DREAMING IS GOOD LIKE A NARCOTIC IN DISCREET DOSES
IT LULLS TO SLEEP THE FEVERS OF THE MIND AT LABOR WHICH ARE SOMETIMES
SEVERE AND PRODUCES IN THE SPIRIT A SOFT AND FRESH VAPOR WHICH CORRECTS
THE OVER HARSH CONTOURS OF PURE THOUGHT FILLS IN GAPS HERE AND THERE
BINDS TOGETHER AND ROUNDS OFF THE ANGLES OF THE IDEAS
BUT TOO MUCH
DREAMING SINKS AND DROWNS
WOE TO THE BRAIN WORKER WHO ALLOWS HIMSELF TO
FALL ENTIRELY FROM THOUGHT INTO REVERY HE THINKS THAT HE CAN RE ASCEND
WITH EQUAL EASE AND HE TELLS HIMSELF THAT AFTER ALL IT IS THE SAME
THING
ERROR
THOUGHT IS THE TOIL OF THE INTELLIGENCE REVERY ITS VOLUPTUOUSNESS
TO
REPLACE THOUGHT WITH REVERY IS TO CONFOUND A POISON WITH A FOOD
MARIUS HAD BEGUN IN THAT WAY AS THE READER WILL REMEMBER
PASSION HAD
SUPERVENED AND HAD FINISHED THE WORK OF PRECIPITATING HIM INTO CHIMAERAS
WITHOUT OBJECT OR BOTTOM
ONE NO LONGER EMERGES FROM ONE'S SELF EXCEPT
FOR THE PURPOSE OF GOING OFF TO DREAM
IDLE PRODUCTION
TUMULTUOUS AND
STAGNANT GULF
AND IN PROPORTION AS LABOR DIMINISHES NEEDS INCREASE
THIS IS A LAW
MAN IN A STATE OF REVERY IS GENERALLY PRODIGAL AND
SLACK THE UNSTRUNG MIND CANNOT HOLD LIFE WITHIN CLOSE BOUNDS
THERE IS IN THAT MODE OF LIFE GOOD MINGLED WITH EVIL FOR IF
ENERVATION IS BALEFUL GENEROSITY IS GOOD AND HEALTHFUL
BUT THE POOR
MAN WHO IS GENEROUS AND NOBLE AND WHO DOES NOT WORK IS LOST
RESOURCES
ARE EXHAUSTED NEEDS CROP UP
FATAL DECLIVITY DOWN WHICH THE MOST HONEST AND THE FIRMEST AS WELL AS
THE MOST FEEBLE AND MOST VICIOUS ARE DRAWN AND WHICH ENDS IN ONE OF TWO
HOLDS SUICIDE OR CRIME
BY DINT OF GOING OUTDOORS TO THINK THE DAY COMES WHEN ONE GOES OUT TO
THROW ONE'S SELF IN THE WATER
EXCESS OF REVERY BREEDS MEN LIKE ESCOUSSE AND LEBRAS
MARIUS WAS DESCENDING THIS DECLIVITY AT A SLOW PACE WITH HIS EYES
FIXED ON THE GIRL WHOM HE NO LONGER SAW
WHAT WE HAVE JUST WRITTEN SEEMS
STRANGE AND YET IT IS TRUE
THE MEMORY OF AN ABSENT BEING KINDLES IN
THE DARKNESS OF THE HEART THE MORE IT HAS DISAPPEARED THE MORE IT
BEAMS THE GLOOMY AND DESPAIRING SOUL SEES THIS LIGHT ON ITS HORIZON
THE STAR OF THE INNER NIGHT
SHE THAT WAS MARIUS' WHOLE THOUGHT
HE
MEDITATED OF NOTHING ELSE HE WAS CONFUSEDLY CONSCIOUS THAT HIS OLD COAT
WAS BECOMING AN IMPOSSIBLE COAT AND THAT HIS NEW COAT WAS GROWING OLD
THAT HIS SHIRTS WERE WEARING OUT THAT HIS HAT WAS WEARING OUT THAT HIS
BOOTS WERE GIVING OUT AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF I COULD BUT SEE HER
ONCE AGAIN BEFORE I DIE
ONE SWEET IDEA ALONE WAS LEFT TO HIM THAT SHE HAD LOVED HIM THAT HER
GLANCE HAD TOLD HIM SO THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME BUT THAT SHE DID
KNOW HIS SOUL AND THAT WHEREVER SHE WAS HOWEVER MYSTERIOUS THE PLACE
SHE STILL LOVED HIM PERHAPS
WHO KNOWS WHETHER SHE WERE NOT THINKING OF
HIM AS HE WAS THINKING OF HER SOMETIMES IN THOSE INEXPLICABLE HOURS
SUCH AS ARE EXPERIENCED BY EVERY HEART THAT LOVES THOUGH HE HAD NO
REASONS FOR ANYTHING BUT SADNESS AND YET FELT AN OBSCURE QUIVER OF JOY
HE SAID TO HIMSELF IT IS HER THOUGHTS THAT ARE COMING TO ME THEN HE
ADDED PERHAPS MY THOUGHTS REACH HER ALSO
THIS ILLUSION AT WHICH HE SHOOK HIS HEAD A MOMENT LATER WAS
SUFFICIENT NEVERTHELESS TO THROW BEAMS WHICH AT TIMES RESEMBLED HOPE
INTO HIS SOUL
FROM TIME TO TIME ESPECIALLY AT THAT EVENING HOUR WHICH
IS THE MOST DEPRESSING TO EVEN THE DREAMY HE ALLOWED THE PUREST THE
MOST IMPERSONAL THE MOST IDEAL OF THE REVERIES WHICH FILLED HIS BRAIN
TO FALL UPON A NOTEBOOK WHICH CONTAINED NOTHING ELSE
HE CALLED THIS
WRITING TO HER
IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT HIS REASON WAS DERANGED
QUITE THE
CONTRARY
HE HAD LOST THE FACULTY OF WORKING AND OF MOVING FIRMLY
TOWARDS ANY FIXED GOAL BUT HE WAS ENDOWED WITH MORE CLEAR SIGHTEDNESS
AND RECTITUDE THAN EVER
MARIUS SURVEYED BY A CALM AND REAL ALTHOUGH
PECULIAR LIGHT WHAT PASSED BEFORE HIS EYES EVEN THE MOST INDIFFERENT
DEEDS AND MEN HE PRONOUNCED A JUST CRITICISM ON EVERYTHING WITH A SORT
OF HONEST DEJECTION AND CANDID DISINTERESTEDNESS
HIS JUDGMENT WHICH
WAS ALMOST WHOLLY DISASSOCIATED FROM HOPE HELD ITSELF ALOOF AND SOARED
ON HIGH
IN THIS STATE OF MIND NOTHING ESCAPED HIM NOTHING DECEIVED HIM AND
EVERY MOMENT HE WAS DISCOVERING THE FOUNDATION OF LIFE OF HUMANITY AND
OF DESTINY
HAPPY EVEN IN THE MIDST OF ANGUISH IS HE TO WHOM GOD HAS
GIVEN A SOUL WORTHY OF LOVE AND OF UNHAPPINESS HE WHO HAS NOT VIEWED
THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD AND THE HEART OF MAN UNDER THIS DOUBLE LIGHT
HAS SEEN NOTHING AND KNOWS NOTHING OF THE TRUE
THE SOUL WHICH LOVES AND SUFFERS IS IN A STATE OF SUBLIMITY
HOWEVER DAY FOLLOWED DAY AND NOTHING NEW PRESENTED ITSELF
IT
MERELY SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE SOMBRE SPACE WHICH STILL REMAINED TO BE
TRAVERSED BY HIM WAS GROWING SHORTER WITH EVERY INSTANT
HE THOUGHT THAT
HE ALREADY DISTINCTLY PERCEIVED THE BRINK OF THE BOTTOMLESS ABYSS
WHAT HE REPEATED TO HIMSELF SHALL I NOT SEE HER AGAIN BEFORE THEN
WHEN YOU HAVE ASCENDED THE RUE SAINT JACQUES LEFT THE BARRIER ON ONE
SIDE AND FOLLOWED THE OLD INNER BOULEVARD FOR SOME DISTANCE YOU REACH
THE RUE DE LA SANTE THEN THE GLACIERE AND A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE
ARRIVING AT THE LITTLE RIVER OF THE GOBELINS YOU COME TO A SORT OF
FIELD WHICH IS THE ONLY SPOT IN THE LONG AND MONOTONOUS CHAIN OF THE
BOULEVARDS OF PARIS WHERE RUYSDEEL WOULD BE TEMPTED TO SIT DOWN
THERE IS SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLE THERE WHICH EXHALES GRACE A GREEN
MEADOW TRAVERSED BY TIGHTLY STRETCHED LINES FROM WHICH FLUTTER RAGS
DRYING IN THE WIND AND AN OLD MARKET GARDENER'S HOUSE BUILT IN THE
TIME OF LOUIS XIII WITH ITS GREAT ROOF ODDLY PIERCED WITH DORMER
WINDOWS DILAPIDATED PALISADES A LITTLE WATER AMID POPLAR TREES
WOMEN VOICES LAUGHTER ON THE HORIZON THE PANTHEON THE POLE OF
THE DEAF MUTES THE VAL DE GRACE BLACK SQUAT FANTASTIC AMUSING
MAGNIFICENT AND IN THE BACKGROUND THE SEVERE SQUARE CRESTS OF THE
TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME
AS THE PLACE IS WORTH LOOKING AT NO ONE GOES THITHER
HARDLY ONE CART
OR WAGONER PASSES IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
IT CHANCED THAT MARIUS' SOLITARY STROLLS LED HIM TO THIS PLOT OF
GROUND NEAR THE WATER
THAT DAY THERE WAS A RARITY ON THE BOULEVARD
A PASSER BY
MARIUS VAGUELY IMPRESSED WITH THE ALMOST SAVAGE BEAUTY OF
THE PLACE ASKED THIS PASSER BY WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS SPOT
THE PERSON REPLIED IT IS THE LARK'S MEADOW
AND HE ADDED IT WAS HERE THAT ULBACH KILLED THE SHEPHERDESS OF IVRY
BUT AFTER THE WORD LARK MARIUS HEARD NOTHING MORE
THESE SUDDEN
CONGEALMENTS IN THE STATE OF REVERY WHICH A SINGLE WORD SUFFICES TO
EVOKE DO OCCUR
THE ENTIRE THOUGHT IS ABRUPTLY CONDENSED AROUND AN
IDEA AND IT IS NO LONGER CAPABLE OF PERCEIVING ANYTHING ELSE
THE LARK WAS THE APPELLATION WHICH HAD REPLACED URSULE IN THE DEPTHS OF
MARIUS' MELANCHOLY STOP SAID HE WITH A SORT OF UNREASONING STUPOR
PECULIAR TO THESE MYSTERIOUS ASIDES THIS IS HER MEADOW
I SHALL KNOW
WHERE SHE LIVES NOW
IT WAS ABSURD BUT IRRESISTIBLE
AND EVERY DAY HE RETURNED TO THAT MEADOW OF THE LARK
CHAPTER II EMBRYONIC FORMATION OF CRIMES IN THE INCUBATION OF PRISONS
JAVERT'S TRIUMPH IN THE GORBEAU HOVEL SEEMED COMPLETE BUT HAD NOT BEEN
SO
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THIS CONSTITUTED THE PRINCIPAL ANXIETY JAVERT
HAD NOT TAKEN THE PRISONER PRISONER
THE ASSASSINATED MAN WHO FLEES
IS MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN THE ASSASSIN AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS
PERSONAGE WHO HAD BEEN SO PRECIOUS A CAPTURE FOR THE RUFFIANS WOULD BE
NO LESS FINE A PRIZE FOR THE AUTHORITIES
AND THEN MONTPARNASSE HAD ESCAPED JAVERT
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF LAYING HANDS ON THAT DEVIL'S DANDY MUST BE
WAITED FOR
MONTPARNASSE HAD IN FACT ENCOUNTERED EPONINE AS SHE STOOD
ON THE WATCH UNDER THE TREES OF THE BOULEVARD AND HAD LED HER OFF
PREFERRING TO PLAY NEMORIN WITH THE DAUGHTER RATHER THAN SCHINDERHANNES
WITH THE FATHER
IT WAS WELL THAT HE DID SO
HE WAS FREE
AS FOR
EPONINE JAVERT HAD CAUSED HER TO BE SEIZED A MEDIOCRE CONSOLATION
EPONINE HAD JOINED AZELMA AT LES MADELONETTES
AND FINALLY ON THE WAY FROM THE GORBEAU HOUSE TO LA FORCE ONE OF THE
PRINCIPAL PRISONERS CLAQUESOUS HAD BEEN LOST
IT WAS NOT KNOWN HOW
THIS HAD BEEN EFFECTED THE POLICE AGENTS AND THE SERGEANTS COULD
NOT UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL HE HAD CONVERTED HIMSELF INTO VAPOR HE HAD
SLIPPED THROUGH THE HANDCUFFS HE HAD TRICKLED THROUGH THE CREVICES OF
THE CARRIAGE THE FIACRE WAS CRACKED AND HE HAD FLED ALL THAT THEY
WERE ABLE TO SAY WAS THAT ON ARRIVING AT THE PRISON THERE WAS NO
CLAQUESOUS
EITHER THE FAIRIES OR THE POLICE HAD HAD A HAND IN IT
HAD
CLAQUESOUS MELTED INTO THE SHADOWS LIKE A SNOW FLAKE IN WATER HAD THERE
BEEN UNAVOWED CONNIVANCE OF THE POLICE AGENTS DID THIS MAN BELONG
TO THE DOUBLE ENIGMA OF ORDER AND DISORDER WAS HE CONCENTRIC WITH
INFRACTION AND REPRESSION HAD THIS SPHINX HIS FORE PAWS IN CRIME AND
HIS HIND PAWS IN AUTHORITY JAVERT DID NOT ACCEPT SUCH COMMINATIONS AND
WOULD HAVE BRISTLED UP AGAINST SUCH COMPROMISES BUT HIS SQUAD INCLUDED
OTHER INSPECTORS BESIDES HIMSELF WHO WERE MORE INITIATED THAN HE
PERHAPS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE HIS SUBORDINATES IN THE SECRETS OF THE
PREFECTURE AND CLAQUESOUS HAD BEEN SUCH A VILLAIN THAT HE MIGHT MAKE
A VERY GOOD AGENT
IT IS AN EXCELLENT THING FOR RUFFIANISM AND AN
ADMIRABLE THING FOR THE POLICE TO BE ON SUCH INTIMATE JUGGLING TERMS
WITH THE NIGHT
THESE DOUBLE EDGED RASCALS DO EXIST
HOWEVER THAT MAY
BE CLAQUESOUS HAD GONE ASTRAY AND WAS NOT FOUND AGAIN
JAVERT APPEARED
TO BE MORE IRRITATED THAN AMAZED AT THIS
AS FOR MARIUS THAT BOOBY OF A LAWYER WHO HAD PROBABLY BECOME
FRIGHTENED AND WHOSE NAME JAVERT HAD FORGOTTEN JAVERT ATTACHED VERY
LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO HIM
MOREOVER A LAWYER CAN BE HUNTED UP AT ANY
TIME
BUT WAS HE A LAWYER AFTER ALL
THE INVESTIGATION HAD BEGUN
THE MAGISTRATE HAD THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE NOT TO PUT ONE OF THESE MEN OF
THE BAND OF PATRON MINETTE IN CLOSE CONFINEMENT IN THE HOPE THAT HE
WOULD CHATTER
THIS MAN WAS BRUJON THE LONG HAIRED MAN OF THE RUE DU
PETIT BANQUIER
HE HAD BEEN LET LOOSE IN THE CHARLEMAGNE COURTYARD AND
THE EYES OF THE WATCHERS WERE FIXED ON HIM
THIS NAME OF BRUJON IS ONE OF THE SOUVENIRS OF LA FORCE
IN THAT HIDEOUS
COURTYARD CALLED THE COURT OF THE BATIMENT NEUF NEW BUILDING WHICH
THE ADMINISTRATION CALLED THE COURT SAINT BERNARD AND WHICH THE ROBBERS
CALLED THE FOSSEAUX LIONS THE LION'S DITCH ON THAT WALL COVERED WITH
SCALES AND LEPROSY WHICH ROSE ON THE LEFT TO A LEVEL WITH THE ROOFS
NEAR AN OLD DOOR OF RUSTY IRON WHICH LED TO THE ANCIENT CHAPEL OF THE
DUCAL RESIDENCE OF LA FORCE THEN TURNED IN A DORMITORY FOR RUFFIANS
THERE COULD STILL BE SEEN TWELVE YEARS AGO A SORT OF FORTRESS ROUGHLY
CARVED IN THE STONE WITH A NAIL AND BENEATH IT THIS SIGNATURE
BRUJON 1811
THE BRUJON OF 1811 WAS THE FATHER OF THE BRUJON OF 1832
THE LATTER OF WHOM THE READER CAUGHT BUT A GLIMPSE AT THE GORBEAU
HOUSE WAS A VERY CUNNING AND VERY ADROIT YOUNG SPARK WITH A BEWILDERED
AND PLAINTIVE AIR
IT WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PLAINTIVE AIR THAT THE
MAGISTRATE HAD RELEASED HIM THINKING HIM MORE USEFUL IN THE CHARLEMAGNE
YARD THAN IN CLOSE CONFINEMENT
ROBBERS DO NOT INTERRUPT THEIR PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE HANDS
OF JUSTICE
THEY DO NOT LET THEMSELVES BE PUT OUT BY SUCH A TRIFLE AS
THAT
TO BE IN PRISON FOR ONE CRIME IS NO REASON FOR NOT BEGINNING ON
ANOTHER CRIME
THEY ARE ARTISTS WHO HAVE ONE PICTURE IN THE SALON AND
WHO TOIL NONE THE LESS ON A NEW WORK IN THEIR STUDIOS
BRUJON SEEMED TO BE STUPEFIED BY PRISON
HE COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN
STANDING BY THE HOUR TOGETHER IN FRONT OF THE SUTLER'S WINDOW IN THE
CHARLEMAGNE YARD STARING LIKE AN IDIOT AT THE SORDID LIST OF PRICES
WHICH BEGAN WITH GARLIC 62 CENTIMES AND ENDED WITH CIGAR 5
CENTIMES
OR HE PASSED HIS TIME IN TREMBLING CHATTERING HIS TEETH
SAYING THAT HE HAD A FEVER AND INQUIRING WHETHER ONE OF THE EIGHT AND
TWENTY BEDS IN THE FEVER WARD WAS VACANT
ALL AT ONCE TOWARDS THE END OF FEBRUARY 1832 IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT
BRUJON THAT SOMNOLENT FELLOW HAD HAD THREE DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS
EXECUTED BY THE ERRAND MEN OF THE ESTABLISHMENT NOT UNDER HIS OWN NAME
BUT IN THE NAME OF THREE OF HIS COMRADES AND THEY HAD COST HIM IN ALL
FIFTY SOUS AN EXORBITANT OUTLAY WHICH ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE
PRISON CORPORAL
INQUIRIES WERE INSTITUTED AND ON CONSULTING THE TARIFF OF COMMISSIONS
POSTED IN THE CONVICT'S PARLOR IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE FIFTY SOUS COULD
BE ANALYZED AS FOLLOWS THREE COMMISSIONS ONE TO THE PANTHEON TEN
SOUS ONE TO VAL DE GRACE FIFTEEN SOUS AND ONE TO THE BARRIERE DE
GRENELLE TWENTY FIVE SOUS
THIS LAST WAS THE DEAREST OF THE WHOLE
TARIFF
NOW AT THE PANTHEON AT THE VAL DE GRACE AND AT THE BARRIERE
DE GRENELLE WERE SITUATED THE DOMICILES OF THE THREE VERY REDOUBTABLE
PROWLERS OF THE BARRIERS KRUIDENIERS ALIAS BIZARRE GLORIEUX AN
EX CONVICT AND BARRE CAROSSE UPON WHOM THE ATTENTION OF THE POLICE WAS
DIRECTED BY THIS INCIDENT
IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THESE MEN WERE MEMBERS
OF PATRON MINETTE TWO OF THOSE LEADERS BABET AND GUEULEMER HAD BEEN
CAPTURED
IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT THE MESSAGES WHICH HAD BEEN ADDRESSED
NOT TO HOUSES BUT TO PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING FOR THEM IN THE STREET
MUST HAVE CONTAINED INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO SOME CRIME THAT HAD BEEN
PLOTTED
THEY WERE IN POSSESSION OF OTHER INDICATIONS THEY LAID HAND ON
THE THREE PROWLERS AND SUPPOSED THAT THEY HAD CIRCUMVENTED SOME ONE OR
OTHER OF BRUJON'S MACHINATIONS
ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THESE MEASURES HAD BEEN TAKEN ONE NIGHT AS THE
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WATCH WHO HAD BEEN INSPECTING THE LOWER DORMITORY
IN THE BATIMENT NEUF WAS ABOUT TO DROP HIS CHESTNUT IN THE BOX THIS
WAS THE MEANS ADOPTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WATCHMEN PERFORMED THEIR
DUTIES PUNCTUALLY EVERY HOUR A CHESTNUT MUST BE DROPPED INTO ALL THE
BOXES NAILED TO THE DOORS OF THE DORMITORIES A WATCHMAN LOOKED THROUGH
THE PEEP HOLE OF THE DORMITORY AND BEHELD BRUJON SITTING ON HIS BED AND
WRITING SOMETHING BY THE LIGHT OF THE HALL LAMP
THE GUARDIAN ENTERED
BRUJON WAS PUT IN A SOLITARY CELL FOR A MONTH BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO
SEIZE WHAT HE HAD WRITTEN
THE POLICE LEARNED NOTHING FURTHER ABOUT IT
WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING A POSTILION
WAS FLUNG FROM THE CHARLEMAGNE YARD INTO THE LIONS' DITCH OVER THE
FIVE STORY BUILDING WHICH SEPARATED THE TWO COURT YARDS
WHAT PRISONERS CALL A POSTILION IS A PELLET OF BREAD ARTISTICALLY
MOULDED WHICH IS SENT INTO IRELAND THAT IS TO SAY OVER THE ROOFS OF A
PRISON FROM ONE COURTYARD TO ANOTHER
ETYMOLOGY OVER ENGLAND FROM ONE
LAND TO ANOTHER INTO IRELAND
THIS LITTLE PELLET FALLS IN THE YARD
THE
MAN WHO PICKS IT UP OPENS IT AND FINDS IN IT A NOTE ADDRESSED TO SOME
PRISONER IN THAT YARD
IF IT IS A PRISONER WHO FINDS THE TREASURE HE
FORWARDS THE NOTE TO ITS DESTINATION IF IT IS A KEEPER OR ONE OF THE
PRISONERS SECRETLY SOLD WHO ARE CALLED SHEEP IN PRISONS AND FOXES IN THE
GALLEYS THE NOTE IS TAKEN TO THE OFFICE AND HANDED OVER TO THE POLICE
ON THIS OCCASION THE POSTILION REACHED ITS ADDRESS ALTHOUGH THE PERSON
TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
THIS PERSON WAS NO OTHER THAN BABET ONE OF THE FOUR HEADS OF PATRON
MINETTE
THE POSTILION CONTAINED A ROLL OF PAPER ON WHICH ONLY THESE TWO LINES
WERE WRITTEN
BABET
THERE IS AN AFFAIR IN THE RUE PLUMET
A GATE ON A GARDEN
THIS IS WHAT BRUJON HAD WRITTEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
IN SPITE OF MALE AND FEMALE SEARCHERS BABET MANAGED TO PASS THE NOTE ON
FROM LA FORCE TO THE SALPETRIERE TO A GOOD FRIEND WHOM HE HAD AND WHO
WAS SHUT UP THERE
THIS WOMAN IN TURN TRANSMITTED THE NOTE TO ANOTHER
WOMAN OF HER ACQUAINTANCE A CERTAIN MAGNON WHO WAS STRONGLY SUSPECTED
BY THE POLICE THOUGH NOT YET ARRESTED
THIS MAGNON WHOSE NAME THE
READER HAS ALREADY SEEN HAD RELATIONS WITH THE THENARDIER WHICH WILL
BE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL LATER ON AND SHE COULD BY GOING TO SEE EPONINE
SERVE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE SALPETRIERE AND LES MADELONETTES
IT HAPPENED THAT AT PRECISELY THAT MOMENT AS PROOFS WERE WANTING
IN THE INVESTIGATION DIRECTED AGAINST THENARDIER IN THE MATTER OF HIS
DAUGHTERS EPONINE AND AZELMA WERE RELEASED
WHEN EPONINE CAME OUT
MAGNON WHO WAS WATCHING THE GATE OF THE MADELONETTES HANDED HER
BRUJON'S NOTE TO BABET CHARGING HER TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER
EPONINE WENT TO THE RUE PLUMET RECOGNIZED THE GATE AND THE GARDEN
OBSERVED THE HOUSE SPIED LURKED AND A FEW DAYS LATER BROUGHT TO
MAGNON WHO DELIVERS IN THE RUE CLOCHEPERCE A BISCUIT WHICH MAGNON
TRANSMITTED TO BABET'S MISTRESS IN THE SALPETRIERE
A BISCUIT IN THE
SHADY SYMBOLISM OF PRISONS SIGNIFIES NOTHING TO BE DONE
SO THAT IN LESS THAN A WEEK FROM THAT TIME AS BRUJON AND BABET MET IN
THE CIRCLE OF LA FORCE THE ONE ON HIS WAY TO THE EXAMINATION THE OTHER
ON HIS WAY FROM IT
WELL ASKED BRUJON THE RUE P
BISCUIT REPLIED BABET
THUS DID THE FOETUS OF CRIME ENGENDERED BY
BRUJON IN LA FORCE MISCARRY
THIS MISCARRIAGE HAD ITS CONSEQUENCES HOWEVER WHICH WERE PERFECTLY
DISTINCT FROM BRUJON'S PROGRAMME
THE READER WILL SEE WHAT THEY WERE
OFTEN WHEN WE THINK WE ARE KNOTTING ONE THREAD WE ARE TYING QUITE
ANOTHER
CHAPTER III APPARITION TO FATHER MABEUF
MARIUS NO LONGER WENT TO SEE ANY ONE BUT HE SOMETIMES ENCOUNTERED
FATHER MABEUF BY CHANCE
WHILE MARIUS WAS SLOWLY DESCENDING THOSE MELANCHOLY STEPS WHICH MAY BE
CALLED THE CELLAR STAIRS AND WHICH LEAD TO PLACES WITHOUT LIGHT WHERE
THE HAPPY CAN BE HEARD WALKING OVERHEAD M
MABEUF WAS DESCENDING ON HIS
SIDE
THE FLORA OF CAUTERETZ NO LONGER SOLD AT ALL
THE EXPERIMENTS ON INDIGO
HAD NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE LITTLE GARDEN OF AUSTERLITZ WHICH HAD
A BAD EXPOSURE
M
MABEUF COULD CULTIVATE THERE ONLY A FEW PLANTS WHICH
LOVE SHADE AND DAMPNESS
NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT BECOME DISCOURAGED
HE
HAD OBTAINED A CORNER IN THE JARDIN DES PLANTES WITH A GOOD EXPOSURE
TO MAKE HIS TRIALS WITH INDIGO AT HIS OWN EXPENSE FOR THIS PURPOSE HE
HAD PAWNED HIS COPPERPLATES OF THE FLORA
HE HAD REDUCED HIS BREAKFAST
TO TWO EGGS AND HE LEFT ONE OF THESE FOR HIS OLD SERVANT TO WHOM HE
HAD PAID NO WAGES FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN MONTHS
AND OFTEN HIS BREAKFAST
WAS HIS ONLY MEAL
HE NO LONGER SMILED WITH HIS INFANTILE SMILE HE HAD
GROWN MOROSE AND NO LONGER RECEIVED VISITORS
MARIUS DID WELL NOT TO
DREAM OF GOING THITHER
SOMETIMES AT THE HOUR WHEN M
MABEUF WAS ON HIS
WAY TO THE JARDIN DES PLANTES THE OLD MAN AND THE YOUNG MAN PASSED
EACH OTHER ON THE BOULEVARD DE L'HOPITAL
THEY DID NOT SPEAK AND ONLY
EXCHANGED A MELANCHOLY SIGN OF THE HEAD
A HEART BREAKING THING IT IS
THAT THERE COMES A MOMENT WHEN MISERY LOOSES BONDS TWO MEN WHO HAVE
BEEN FRIENDS BECOME TWO CHANCE PASSERS BY
ROYAL THE BOOKSELLER WAS DEAD
M
MABEUF NO LONGER KNEW HIS BOOKS
HIS GARDEN OR HIS INDIGO THESE WERE THE THREE FORMS WHICH HAPPINESS
PLEASURE AND HOPE HAD ASSUMED FOR HIM
THIS SUFFICED HIM FOR HIS
LIVING
HE SAID TO HIMSELF WHEN I SHALL HAVE MADE MY BALLS OF BLUEING
I SHALL BE RICH I WILL WITHDRAW MY COPPERPLATES FROM THE PAWN SHOP
I WILL PUT MY FLORA IN VOGUE AGAIN WITH TRICKERY PLENTY OF MONEY AND
ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND I WILL BUY I KNOW WELL WHERE A
COPY OF PIERRE DE MEDINE'S ART DE NAVIGUER WITH WOOD CUTS EDITION OF
1655 IN THE MEANTIME HE TOILED ALL DAY OVER HIS PLOT OF INDIGO AND
AT NIGHT HE RETURNED HOME TO WATER HIS GARDEN AND TO READ HIS BOOKS
AT
THAT EPOCH M
MABEUF WAS NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE
ONE EVENING HE HAD A SINGULAR APPARITION
HE HAD RETURNED HOME WHILE IT WAS STILL BROAD DAYLIGHT
MOTHER
PLUTARQUE WHOSE HEALTH WAS DECLINING WAS ILL AND IN BED
HE HAD DINED
ON A BONE ON WHICH A LITTLE MEAT LINGERED AND A BIT OF BREAD THAT HE
HAD FOUND ON THE KITCHEN TABLE AND HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON AN OVERTURNED
STONE POST WHICH TOOK THE PLACE OF A BENCH IN HIS GARDEN
NEAR THIS BENCH THERE ROSE AFTER THE FASHION IN ORCHARD GARDENS A SORT
OF LARGE CHEST OF BEAMS AND PLANKS MUCH DILAPIDATED A RABBIT HUTCH ON
THE GROUND FLOOR A FRUIT CLOSET ON THE FIRST
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE
HUTCH BUT THERE WERE A FEW APPLES IN THE FRUIT CLOSET THE REMAINS OF
THE WINTER'S PROVISION
M
MABEUF HAD SET HIMSELF TO TURNING OVER AND READING WITH THE AID OF
HIS GLASSES TWO BOOKS OF WHICH HE WAS PASSIONATELY FOND AND IN WHICH
A SERIOUS THING AT HIS AGE HE WAS INTERESTED
HIS NATURAL TIMIDITY
RENDERED HIM ACCESSIBLE TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF SUPERSTITIONS IN A CERTAIN
DEGREE
THE FIRST OF THESE BOOKS WAS THE FAMOUS TREATISE OF PRESIDENT
DELANCRE DE L'INCONSTANCE DES DEMONS THE OTHER WAS A QUARTO BY MUTOR
DE LA RUBAUDIERE SUR LES DIABLES DE VAUVERT ET LES GOBELINS DE LA
BIEVRE
THIS LAST MENTIONED OLD VOLUME INTERESTED HIM ALL THE MORE
BECAUSE HIS GARDEN HAD BEEN ONE OF THE SPOTS HAUNTED BY GOBLINS IN
FORMER TIMES
THE TWILIGHT HAD BEGUN TO WHITEN WHAT WAS ON HIGH AND TO
BLACKEN ALL BELOW
AS HE READ OVER THE TOP OF THE BOOK WHICH HE HELD
IN HIS HAND FATHER MABEUF WAS SURVEYING HIS PLANTS AND AMONG OTHERS A
MAGNIFICENT RHODODENDRON WHICH WAS ONE OF HIS CONSOLATIONS FOUR DAYS OF
HEAT WIND AND SUN WITHOUT A DROP OF RAIN HAD PASSED THE STALKS WERE
BENDING THE BUDS DROOPING THE LEAVES FALLING ALL THIS NEEDED WATER
THE RHODODENDRON WAS PARTICULARLY SAD
FATHER MABEUF WAS ONE OF THOSE
PERSONS FOR WHOM PLANTS HAVE SOULS
THE OLD MAN HAD TOILED ALL DAY OVER
HIS INDIGO PLOT HE WAS WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE BUT HE ROSE LAID
HIS BOOKS ON THE BENCH AND WALKED ALL BENT OVER AND WITH TOTTERING
FOOTSTEPS TO THE WELL BUT WHEN HE HAD GRASPED THE CHAIN HE COULD NOT
EVEN DRAW IT SUFFICIENTLY TO UNHOOK IT
THEN HE TURNED ROUND AND CAST A
GLANCE OF ANGUISH TOWARD HEAVEN WHICH WAS BECOMING STUDDED WITH STARS
THE EVENING HAD THAT SERENITY WHICH OVERWHELMS THE TROUBLES OF MAN
BENEATH AN INDESCRIBABLY MOURNFUL AND ETERNAL JOY
THE NIGHT PROMISED TO
BE AS ARID AS THE DAY HAD BEEN
STARS EVERYWHERE THOUGHT THE OLD MAN NOT THE TINIEST CLOUD NOT A
DROP OF WATER
AND HIS HEAD WHICH HAD BEEN UPRAISED FOR A MOMENT FELL BACK UPON HIS
BREAST
HE RAISED IT AGAIN AND ONCE MORE LOOKED AT THE SKY MURMURING
A TEAR OF DEW A LITTLE PITY
HE TRIED AGAIN TO UNHOOK THE CHAIN OF THE WELL AND COULD NOT
AT THAT MOMENT HE HEARD A VOICE SAYING
FATHER MABEUF WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME WATER YOUR GARDEN FOR YOU
AT THE SAME TIME A NOISE AS OF A WILD ANIMAL PASSING BECAME AUDIBLE
IN THE HEDGE AND HE BEHELD EMERGING FROM THE SHRUBBERY A SORT OF TALL
SLENDER GIRL WHO DREW HERSELF UP IN FRONT OF HIM AND STARED BOLDLY AT
HIM
SHE HAD LESS THE AIR OF A HUMAN BEING THAN OF A FORM WHICH HAD JUST
BLOSSOMED FORTH FROM THE TWILIGHT
BEFORE FATHER MABEUF WHO WAS EASILY TERRIFIED AND WHO WAS AS WE HAVE
SAID QUICK TO TAKE ALARM WAS ABLE TO REPLY BY A SINGLE SYLLABLE THIS
BEING WHOSE MOVEMENTS HAD A SORT OF ODD ABRUPTNESS IN THE DARKNESS HAD
UNHOOKED THE CHAIN PLUNGED IN AND WITHDRAWN THE BUCKET AND FILLED THE
WATERING POT AND THE GOODMAN BEHELD THIS APPARITION WHICH HAD BARE
FEET AND A TATTERED PETTICOAT RUNNING ABOUT AMONG THE FLOWER BEDS
DISTRIBUTING LIFE AROUND HER
THE SOUND OF THE WATERING POT ON THE
LEAVES FILLED FATHER MABEUF'S SOUL WITH ECSTASY
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT
THE RHODODENDRON WAS HAPPY NOW
THE FIRST BUCKETFUL EMPTIED THE GIRL DREW A SECOND THEN A THIRD
SHE
WATERED THE WHOLE GARDEN
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HER AS SHE THUS RAN ABOUT AMONG PATHS WHERE
HER OUTLINE APPEARED PERFECTLY BLACK WAVING HER ANGULAR ARMS AND WITH
HER FICHU ALL IN RAGS THAT RESEMBLED A BAT
WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED FATHER MABEUF APPROACHED HER WITH TEARS IN HIS
EYES AND LAID HIS HAND ON HER BROW
GOD WILL BLESS YOU SAID HE YOU ARE AN ANGEL SINCE YOU TAKE CARE OF
THE FLOWERS
NO SHE REPLIED
I AM THE DEVIL BUT THAT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME
THE OLD MAN EXCLAIMED WITHOUT EITHER WAITING FOR OR HEARING HER
RESPONSE
WHAT A PITY THAT I AM SO UNHAPPY AND SO POOR AND THAT I CAN DO NOTHING
FOR YOU
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING SAID SHE
WHAT
TELL ME WHERE M
MARIUS LIVES
THE OLD MAN DID NOT UNDERSTAND
WHAT MONSIEUR MARIUS
HE RAISED HIS GLASSY EYES AND SEEMED TO BE SEEKING SOMETHING THAT HAD
VANISHED
A YOUNG MAN WHO USED TO COME HERE
IN THE MEANTIME M
MABEUF HAD SEARCHED HIS MEMORY
AH YES HE EXCLAIMED
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
WAIT MONSIEUR
MARIUS THE BARON MARIUS PONTMERCY PARBLEU HE LIVES OR RATHER HE NO
LONGER LIVES AH WELL I DON'T KNOW
AS HE SPOKE HE HAD BENT OVER TO TRAIN A BRANCH OF RHODODENDRON AND HE
CONTINUED
HOLD I KNOW NOW
HE VERY OFTEN PASSES ALONG THE BOULEVARD AND GOES IN
THE DIRECTION OF THE GLACIERE RUE CROULEBARBE
THE MEADOW OF THE LARK
GO THERE
IT IS NOT HARD TO MEET HIM
WHEN M
MABEUF STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ONE
THERE THE GIRL HAD DISAPPEARED
HE WAS DECIDEDLY TERRIFIED
REALLY HE THOUGHT IF MY GARDEN HAD NOT BEEN WATERED I SHOULD THINK
THAT SHE WAS A SPIRIT
AN HOUR LATER WHEN HE WAS IN BED IT CAME BACK TO HIM AND AS HE FELL
ASLEEP AT THAT CONFUSED MOMENT WHEN THOUGHT LIKE THAT FABULOUS BIRD
WHICH CHANGES ITSELF INTO A FISH IN ORDER TO CROSS THE SEA LITTLE BY
LITTLE ASSUMES THE FORM OF A DREAM IN ORDER TO TRAVERSE SLUMBER HE SAID
TO HIMSELF IN A BEWILDERED WAY
IN SOOTH THAT GREATLY RESEMBLES WHAT RUBAUDIERE NARRATES OF THE
GOBLINS
COULD IT HAVE BEEN A GOBLIN
CHAPTER IV AN APPARITION TO MARIUS
SOME DAYS AFTER THIS VISIT OF A SPIRIT TO FARMER MABEUF ONE
MORNING IT WAS ON A MONDAY THE DAY WHEN MARIUS BORROWED THE
HUNDRED SOU PIECE FROM COURFEYRAC FOR THENARDIER MARIUS HAD PUT THIS
COIN IN HIS POCKET AND BEFORE CARRYING IT TO THE CLERK'S OFFICE HE
HAD GONE TO TAKE A LITTLE STROLL IN THE HOPE THAT THIS WOULD MAKE HIM
WORK ON HIS RETURN
IT WAS ALWAYS THUS HOWEVER
AS SOON AS HE ROSE HE
SEATED HIMSELF BEFORE A BOOK AND A SHEET OF PAPER IN ORDER TO SCRIBBLE
SOME TRANSLATION HIS TASK AT THAT EPOCH CONSISTED IN TURNING INTO
FRENCH A CELEBRATED QUARREL BETWEEN GERMANS THE GANS AND SAVIGNY
CONTROVERSY HE TOOK SAVIGNY HE TOOK GANS READ FOUR LINES TRIED TO
WRITE ONE COULD NOT SAW A STAR BETWEEN HIM AND HIS PAPER AND ROSE
FROM HIS CHAIR SAYING I SHALL GO OUT
THAT WILL PUT ME IN SPIRITS
AND OFF HE WENT TO THE LARK'S MEADOW
THERE HE BEHELD MORE THAN EVER THE STAR AND LESS THAN EVER SAVIGNY AND
GANS
HE RETURNED HOME TRIED TO TAKE UP HIS WORK AGAIN AND DID NOT SUCCEED
THERE WAS NO MEANS OF RE KNOTTING A SINGLE ONE OF THE THREADS WHICH
WERE BROKEN IN HIS BRAIN THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT GO OUT
TO MORROW
IT PREVENTS MY WORKING AND HE WENT OUT EVERY DAY
HE LIVED IN THE LARK'S MEADOW MORE THAN IN COURFEYRAC'S LODGINGS
THAT
WAS HIS REAL ADDRESS BOULEVARD DE LA SANTE AT THE SEVENTH TREE FROM
THE RUE CROULEBARBE
THAT MORNING HE HAD QUITTED THE SEVENTH TREE AND HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON
THE PARAPET OF THE RIVER DES GOBELINS
A CHEERFUL SUNLIGHT PENETRATED
THE FRESHLY UNFOLDED AND LUMINOUS LEAVES
HE WAS DREAMING OF HER AND HIS MEDITATION TURNING TO A REPROACH FELL
BACK UPON HIMSELF HE REFLECTED DOLEFULLY ON HIS IDLENESS HIS PARALYSIS
OF SOUL WHICH WAS GAINING ON HIM AND OF THAT NIGHT WHICH WAS GROWING
MORE DENSE EVERY MOMENT BEFORE HIM TO SUCH A POINT THAT HE NO LONGER
EVEN SAW THE SUN
NEVERTHELESS ATHWART THIS PAINFUL EXTRICATION OF INDISTINCT IDEAS WHICH
WAS NOT EVEN A MONOLOGUE SO FEEBLE HAD ACTION BECOME IN HIM AND HE
HAD NO LONGER THE FORCE TO CARE TO DESPAIR ATHWART THIS MELANCHOLY
ABSORPTION SENSATIONS FROM WITHOUT DID REACH HIM
HE HEARD BEHIND HIM
BENEATH HIM ON BOTH BANKS OF THE RIVER THE LAUNDRESSES OF THE GOBELINS
BEATING THEIR LINEN AND ABOVE HIS HEAD THE BIRDS CHATTERING AND
SINGING IN THE ELM TREES
ON THE ONE HAND THE SOUND OF LIBERTY THE
CARELESS HAPPINESS OF THE LEISURE WHICH HAS WINGS ON THE OTHER THE
SOUND OF TOIL
WHAT CAUSED HIM TO MEDITATE DEEPLY AND ALMOST REFLECT
WERE TWO CHEERFUL SOUNDS
ALL AT ONCE IN THE MIDST OF HIS DEJECTED ECSTASY HE HEARD A FAMILIAR
VOICE SAYING
COME HERE HE IS
HE RAISED HIS EYES AND RECOGNIZED THAT WRETCHED CHILD WHO HAD COME TO
HIM ONE MORNING THE ELDER OF THE THENARDIER DAUGHTERS EPONINE HE KNEW
HER NAME NOW
STRANGE TO SAY SHE HAD GROWN POORER AND PRETTIER
TWO STEPS WHICH IT HAD NOT SEEMED WITHIN HER POWER TO TAKE
SHE HAD
ACCOMPLISHED A DOUBLE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND TOWARDS DISTRESS
SHE WAS BAREFOOTED AND IN RAGS AS ON THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD SO RESOLUTELY
ENTERED HIS CHAMBER ONLY HER RAGS WERE TWO MONTHS OLDER NOW THE HOLES
WERE LARGER THE TATTERS MORE SORDID
IT WAS THE SAME HARSH VOICE
THE SAME BROW DIMMED AND WRINKLED WITH TAN THE SAME FREE WILD AND
VACILLATING GLANCE
SHE HAD BESIDES MORE THAN FORMERLY IN HER FACE
THAT INDESCRIBABLY TERRIFIED AND LAMENTABLE SOMETHING WHICH SOJOURN IN A
PRISON ADDS TO WRETCHEDNESS
SHE HAD BITS OF STRAW AND HAY IN HER HAIR NOT LIKE OPHELIA THROUGH
HAVING GONE MAD FROM THE CONTAGION OF HAMLET'S MADNESS BUT BECAUSE SHE
HAD SLEPT IN THE LOFT OF SOME STABLE
AND IN SPITE OF IT ALL SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
WHAT A STAR ART THOU O
YOUTH
IN THE MEANTIME SHE HAD HALTED IN FRONT OF MARIUS WITH A TRACE OF JOY
IN HER LIVID COUNTENANCE AND SOMETHING WHICH RESEMBLED A SMILE
SHE STOOD FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS AS THOUGH INCAPABLE OF SPEECH
SO I HAVE MET YOU AT LAST SHE SAID AT LENGTH

MARIUS MADE NO REPLY
AH SHE WENT ON YOU HAVE A HOLE IN YOUR SHIRT
I MUST SEW IT UP FOR

SHE RESUMED WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH GRADUALLY CLOUDED OVER
YOU DON'T SEEM GLAD TO SEE ME
MARIUS HELD HIS PEACE SHE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT THEN
EXCLAIMED
BUT IF I CHOOSE NEVERTHELESS I COULD FORCE YOU TO LOOK GLAD
WHAT DEMANDED MARIUS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
AH YOU USED TO CALL ME THOU SHE RETORTED
WELL THEN WHAT DOST THOU MEAN
SHE BIT HER LIPS SHE SEEMED TO HESITATE AS THOUGH A PREY TO SOME SORT
OF INWARD CONFLICT
AT LAST SHE APPEARED TO COME TO A DECISION
SO MUCH THE WORSE I DON'T CARE

TO BE PLEASED
ONLY PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL SMILE

THE HEART OF AN OBSERVER BUT WHICH DID NOT EVEN GRAZE MARIUS IN HIS
INTOXICATED AND ECSTATIC STATE

NO TONGUE CAN EXPRESS ALL THAT LAY IN THAT WORD WOMAN THUS PRONOUNCED
BY THAT CHILD
SHE PROCEEDED A DOZEN PACES AND THEN HALTED ONCE MORE MARIUS JOINED
HER
SHE ADDRESSED HIM SIDEWAYS AND WITHOUT TURNING TOWARDS HIM
BY THE WAY YOU KNOW THAT YOU PROMISED ME SOMETHING
MARIUS FUMBLED IN HIS POCKET
ALL THAT HE OWNED IN THE WORLD WAS THE
FIVE FRANCS INTENDED FOR THENARDIER THE FATHER
HE TOOK THEM AND LAID
THEM IN EPONINE'S HAND
SHE OPENED HER FINGERS AND LET THE COIN FALL TO THE GROUND AND GAZED AT
HIM WITH A GLOOMY AIR
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY SAID SHE
BOOK THIRD THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET
CHAPTER I THE HOUSE WITH A SECRET
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY A CHIEF JUSTICE IN THE PARLIAMENT
OF PARIS HAVING A MISTRESS AND CONCEALING THE FACT FOR AT THAT PERIOD
THE GRAND SEIGNORS DISPLAYED THEIR MISTRESSES AND THE BOURGEOIS
CONCEALED THEM HAD A LITTLE HOUSE BUILT IN THE FAUBOURG
SAINT GERMAIN IN THE DESERTED RUE BLOMET WHICH IS NOW CALLED RUE
PLUMET NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHICH WAS THEN DESIGNATED AS COMBAT DES
ANIMAUX
THIS HOUSE WAS COMPOSED OF A SINGLE STORIED PAVILION TWO ROOMS ON THE
GROUND FLOOR TWO CHAMBERS ON THE FIRST FLOOR A KITCHEN DOWN STAIRS
A BOUDOIR UP STAIRS AN ATTIC UNDER THE ROOF THE WHOLE PRECEDED BY A
GARDEN WITH A LARGE GATE OPENING ON THE STREET
THIS GARDEN WAS ABOUT
AN ACRE AND A HALF IN EXTENT
THIS WAS ALL THAT COULD BE SEEN BY
PASSERS BY BUT BEHIND THE PAVILION THERE WAS A NARROW COURTYARD AND
AT THE END OF THE COURTYARD A LOW BUILDING CONSISTING OF TWO ROOMS AND
A CELLAR A SORT OF PREPARATION DESTINED TO CONCEAL A CHILD AND NURSE
IN CASE OF NEED
THIS BUILDING COMMUNICATED IN THE REAR BY A MASKED
DOOR WHICH OPENED BY A SECRET SPRING WITH A LONG NARROW PAVED WINDING
CORRIDOR OPEN TO THE SKY HEMMED IN WITH TWO LOFTY WALLS WHICH HIDDEN
WITH WONDERFUL ART AND LOST AS IT WERE BETWEEN GARDEN ENCLOSURES AND
CULTIVATED LAND ALL OF WHOSE ANGLES AND DETOURS IT FOLLOWED ENDED IN
ANOTHER DOOR ALSO WITH A SECRET LOCK WHICH OPENED A QUARTER OF A LEAGUE
AWAY ALMOST IN ANOTHER QUARTER AT THE SOLITARY EXTREMITY OF THE RUE DU
BABYLONE
THROUGH THIS THE CHIEF JUSTICE ENTERED SO THAT EVEN THOSE WHO WERE
SPYING ON HIM AND FOLLOWING HIM WOULD MERELY HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE
JUSTICE BETOOK HIMSELF EVERY DAY IN A MYSTERIOUS WAY SOMEWHERE AND
WOULD NEVER HAVE SUSPECTED THAT TO GO TO THE RUE DE BABYLONE WAS TO GO
TO THE RUE BLOMET
THANKS TO CLEVER PURCHASERS OF LAND THE MAGISTRATE
HAD BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A SECRET SEWER LIKE PASSAGE ON HIS OWN PROPERTY
AND CONSEQUENTLY WITHOUT INTERFERENCE
LATER ON HE HAD SOLD IN LITTLE
PARCELS FOR GARDENS AND MARKET GARDENS THE LOTS OF GROUND ADJOINING
THE CORRIDOR AND THE PROPRIETORS OF THESE LOTS ON BOTH SIDES THOUGHT
THEY HAD A PARTY WALL BEFORE THEIR EYES AND DID NOT EVEN SUSPECT THE
LONG PAVED RIBBON WINDING BETWEEN TWO WALLS AMID THEIR FLOWER BEDS AND
THEIR ORCHARDS
ONLY THE BIRDS BEHELD THIS CURIOSITY
IT IS PROBABLE
THAT THE LINNETS AND TOMTITS OF THE LAST CENTURY GOSSIPED A GREAT DEAL
ABOUT THE CHIEF JUSTICE
THE PAVILION BUILT OF STONE IN THE TASTE OF MANSARD WAINSCOTED AND
FURNISHED IN THE WATTEAU STYLE ROCAILLE ON THE INSIDE OLD FASHIONED
ON THE OUTSIDE WALLED IN WITH A TRIPLE HEDGE OF FLOWERS HAD SOMETHING
DISCREET COQUETTISH AND SOLEMN ABOUT IT AS BEFITS A CAPRICE OF LOVE
AND MAGISTRACY
THIS HOUSE AND CORRIDOR WHICH HAVE NOW DISAPPEARED WERE IN EXISTENCE
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO
IN '93 A COPPERSMITH HAD PURCHASED THE HOUSE WITH
THE IDEA OF DEMOLISHING IT BUT HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO PAY THE PRICE THE
NATION MADE HIM BANKRUPT
SO THAT IT WAS THE HOUSE WHICH DEMOLISHED THE
COPPERSMITH
AFTER THAT THE HOUSE REMAINED UNINHABITED AND FELL SLOWLY
TO RUIN AS DOES EVERY DWELLING TO WHICH THE PRESENCE OF MAN DOES NOT
COMMUNICATE LIFE
IT HAD REMAINED FITTED WITH ITS OLD FURNITURE WAS
ALWAYS FOR SALE OR TO LET AND THE TEN OR A DOZEN PEOPLE WHO PASSED
THROUGH THE RUE PLUMET WERE WARNED OF THE FACT BY A YELLOW AND ILLEGIBLE
BIT OF WRITING WHICH HAD HUNG ON THE GARDEN WALL SINCE 1819
TOWARDS THE END OF THE RESTORATION THESE SAME PASSERS BY MIGHT HAVE
NOTICED THAT THE BILL HAD DISAPPEARED AND EVEN THAT THE SHUTTERS ON THE
FIRST FLOOR WERE OPEN
THE HOUSE WAS OCCUPIED IN FACT
THE WINDOWS HAD
SHORT CURTAINS A SIGN THAT THERE WAS A WOMAN ABOUT
IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 1829 A MAN OF A CERTAIN AGE HAD PRESENTED
HIMSELF AND HAD HIRED THE HOUSE JUST AS IT STOOD INCLUDING OF COURSE
THE BACK BUILDING AND THE LANE WHICH ENDED IN THE RUE DE BABYLONE
HE
HAD HAD THE SECRET OPENINGS OF THE TWO DOORS TO THIS PASSAGE REPAIRED
THE HOUSE AS WE HAVE JUST MENTIONED WAS STILL VERY NEARLY FURNISHED
WITH THE JUSTICE'S OLD FITTING THE NEW TENANT HAD ORDERED SOME
REPAIRS HAD ADDED WHAT WAS LACKING HERE AND THERE HAD REPLACED THE
PAVING STONES IN THE YARD BRICKS IN THE FLOORS STEPS IN THE STAIRS
MISSING BITS IN THE INLAID FLOORS AND THE GLASS IN THE LATTICE WINDOWS
AND HAD FINALLY INSTALLED HIMSELF THERE WITH A YOUNG GIRL AND AN ELDERLY
MAID SERVANT WITHOUT COMMOTION RATHER LIKE A PERSON WHO IS SLIPPING
IN THAN LIKE A MAN WHO IS ENTERING HIS OWN HOUSE
THE NEIGHBORS DID NOT
GOSSIP ABOUT HIM FOR THE REASON THAT THERE WERE NO NEIGHBORS
THIS UNOBTRUSIVE TENANT WAS JEAN VALJEAN THE YOUNG GIRL WAS COSETTE
THE SERVANT WAS A WOMAN NAMED TOUSSAINT WHOM JEAN VALJEAN HAD SAVED
FROM THE HOSPITAL AND FROM WRETCHEDNESS AND WHO WAS ELDERLY A
STAMMERER AND FROM THE PROVINCES THREE QUALITIES WHICH HAD DECIDED
JEAN VALJEAN TO TAKE HER WITH HIM
HE HAD HIRED THE HOUSE UNDER THE NAME
OF M
FAUCHELEVENT INDEPENDENT GENTLEMAN
IN ALL THAT HAS BEEN
RELATED HERETOFORE THE READER HAS DOUBTLESS BEEN NO LESS PROMPT THAN
THENARDIER TO RECOGNIZE JEAN VALJEAN
WHY HAD JEAN VALJEAN QUITTED THE CONVENT OF THE PETIT PICPUS WHAT HAD
HAPPENED
NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT JEAN VALJEAN WAS HAPPY IN THE CONVENT SO
HAPPY THAT HIS CONSCIENCE FINALLY TOOK THE ALARM
HE SAW COSETTE EVERY
DAY HE FELT PATERNITY SPRING UP AND DEVELOP WITHIN HIM MORE AND MORE
HE BROODED OVER THE SOUL OF THAT CHILD HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT SHE
WAS HIS THAT NOTHING COULD TAKE HER FROM HIM THAT THIS WOULD LAST
INDEFINITELY THAT SHE WOULD CERTAINLY BECOME A NUN BEING THERETO
GENTLY INCITED EVERY DAY THAT THUS THE CONVENT WAS HENCEFORTH THE
UNIVERSE FOR HER AS IT WAS FOR HIM THAT HE SHOULD GROW OLD THERE AND
THAT SHE WOULD GROW UP THERE THAT SHE WOULD GROW OLD THERE AND THAT
HE SHOULD DIE THERE THAT IN SHORT DELIGHTFUL HOPE NO SEPARATION
WAS POSSIBLE
ON REFLECTING UPON THIS HE FELL INTO PERPLEXITY
HE
INTERROGATED HIMSELF
HE ASKED HIMSELF IF ALL THAT HAPPINESS WERE
REALLY HIS IF IT WERE NOT COMPOSED OF THE HAPPINESS OF ANOTHER OF
THE HAPPINESS OF THAT CHILD WHICH HE AN OLD MAN WAS CONFISCATING AND
STEALING IF THAT WERE NOT THEFT HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THIS CHILD
HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW LIFE BEFORE RENOUNCING IT THAT TO DEPRIVE HER IN
ADVANCE AND IN SOME SORT WITHOUT CONSULTING HER OF ALL JOYS UNDER
THE PRETEXT OF SAVING HER FROM ALL TRIALS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER
IGNORANCE OF HER ISOLATION IN ORDER TO MAKE AN ARTIFICIAL VOCATION
GERMINATE IN HER WAS TO ROB A HUMAN CREATURE OF ITS NATURE AND TO LIE
TO GOD
AND WHO KNOWS IF WHEN SHE CAME TO BE AWARE OF ALL THIS SOME
DAY AND FOUND HERSELF A NUN TO HER SORROW COSETTE WOULD NOT COME TO
HATE HIM A LAST ALMOST SELFISH THOUGHT AND LESS HEROIC THAN THE REST
BUT WHICH WAS INTOLERABLE TO HIM
HE RESOLVED TO QUIT THE CONVENT
HE RESOLVED ON THIS HE RECOGNIZED WITH ANGUISH THE FACT THAT IT WAS
NECESSARY
AS FOR OBJECTIONS THERE WERE NONE
FIVE YEARS' SOJOURN
BETWEEN THESE FOUR WALLS AND OF DISAPPEARANCE HAD NECESSARILY DESTROYED
OR DISPERSED THE ELEMENTS OF FEAR
HE COULD RETURN TRANQUILLY AMONG MEN
HE HAD GROWN OLD AND ALL HAD UNDERGONE A CHANGE
WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE
HIM NOW AND THEN TO FACE THE WORST THERE WAS DANGER ONLY FOR HIMSELF
AND HE HAD NO RIGHT TO CONDEMN COSETTE TO THE CLOISTER FOR THE REASON
THAT HE HAD BEEN CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS
BESIDES WHAT IS DANGER IN
COMPARISON WITH THE RIGHT FINALLY NOTHING PREVENTED HIS BEING PRUDENT
AND TAKING HIS PRECAUTIONS
AS FOR COSETTE'S EDUCATION IT WAS ALMOST FINISHED AND COMPLETE
HIS DETERMINATION ONCE TAKEN HE AWAITED AN OPPORTUNITY
IT WAS NOT LONG
IN PRESENTING ITSELF
OLD FAUCHELEVENT DIED
JEAN VALJEAN DEMANDED AN AUDIENCE WITH THE REVERED PRIORESS AND TOLD HER
THAT HAVING COME INTO A LITTLE INHERITANCE AT THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER
WHICH PERMITTED HIM HENCEFORTH TO LIVE WITHOUT WORKING HE SHOULD LEAVE
THE SERVICE OF THE CONVENT AND TAKE HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM BUT THAT AS
IT WAS NOT JUST THAT COSETTE SINCE SHE HAD NOT TAKEN THE VOWS SHOULD
HAVE RECEIVED HER EDUCATION GRATUITOUSLY HE HUMBLY BEGGED THE REVEREND
PRIORESS TO SEE FIT THAT HE SHOULD OFFER TO THE COMMUNITY AS INDEMNITY
FOR THE FIVE YEARS WHICH COSETTE HAD SPENT THERE THE SUM OF FIVE
THOUSAND FRANCS
IT WAS THUS THAT JEAN VALJEAN QUITTED THE CONVENT OF THE PERPETUAL
ADORATION
ON LEAVING THE CONVENT HE TOOK IN HIS OWN ARMS THE LITTLE VALISE THE
KEY TO WHICH HE STILL WORE ON HIS PERSON AND WOULD PERMIT NO PORTER TO
TOUCH IT
THIS PUZZLED COSETTE BECAUSE OF THE ODOR OF EMBALMING WHICH
PROCEEDED FROM IT
LET US STATE AT ONCE THAT THIS TRUNK NEVER QUITTED HIM MORE
HE ALWAYS
HAD IT IN HIS CHAMBER
IT WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY THING SOMETIMES THAT
HE CARRIED OFF IN HIS MOVING WHEN HE MOVED ABOUT
COSETTE LAUGHED AT IT
AND CALLED THIS VALISE HIS INSEPARABLE SAYING I AM JEALOUS OF IT
NEVERTHELESS JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT REAPPEAR IN THE OPEN AIR WITHOUT
PROFOUND ANXIETY
HE DISCOVERED THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET AND HID HIMSELF FROM
SIGHT THERE
HENCEFORTH HE WAS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE NAME ULTIME
FAUCHELEVENT
AT THE SAME TIME HE HIRED TWO OTHER APARTMENTS IN PARIS IN ORDER THAT
HE MIGHT ATTRACT LESS ATTENTION THAN IF HE WERE TO REMAIN ALWAYS IN THE
SAME QUARTER AND SO THAT HE COULD AT NEED TAKE HIMSELF OFF AT THE
SLIGHTEST DISQUIETUDE WHICH SHOULD ASSAIL HIM AND IN SHORT SO THAT
HE MIGHT NOT AGAIN BE CAUGHT UNPROVIDED AS ON THE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD
SO MIRACULOUSLY ESCAPED FROM JAVERT
THESE TWO APARTMENTS WERE VERY
PITIABLE POOR IN APPEARANCE AND IN TWO QUARTERS WHICH WERE FAR REMOTE
FROM EACH OTHER THE ONE IN THE RUE DE L'OUEST THE OTHER IN THE RUE DE
L'HOMME ARME
HE WENT FROM TIME TO TIME NOW TO THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME NOW TO THE
RUE DE L'OUEST TO PASS A MONTH OR SIX WEEKS WITHOUT TAKING TOUSSAINT
HE HAD HIMSELF SERVED BY THE PORTERS AND GAVE HIMSELF OUT AS A
GENTLEMAN FROM THE SUBURBS LIVING ON HIS FUNDS AND HAVING A LITTLE
TEMPORARY RESTING PLACE IN TOWN
THIS LOFTY VIRTUE HAD THREE DOMICILES
IN PARIS FOR THE SAKE OF ESCAPING FROM THE POLICE
CHAPTER II JEAN VALJEAN AS A NATIONAL GUARD
HOWEVER PROPERLY SPEAKING HE LIVED IN THE RUE PLUMET AND HE HAD
ARRANGED HIS EXISTENCE THERE IN THE FOLLOWING FASHION
COSETTE AND THE SERVANT OCCUPIED THE PAVILION SHE HAD THE BIG
SLEEPING ROOM WITH THE PAINTED PIER GLASSES THE BOUDOIR WITH THE GILDED
FILLETS THE JUSTICE'S DRAWING ROOM FURNISHED WITH TAPESTRIES AND VAST
ARM CHAIRS SHE HAD THE GARDEN
JEAN VALJEAN HAD A CANOPIED BED OF
ANTIQUE DAMASK IN THREE COLORS AND A BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN RUG PURCHASED IN
THE RUE DU FIGUIER SAINT PAUL AT MOTHER GAUCHER'S PUT INTO COSETTE'S
CHAMBER AND IN ORDER TO REDEEM THE SEVERITY OF THESE MAGNIFICENT
OLD THINGS HE HAD AMALGAMATED WITH THIS BRIC A BRAC ALL THE GAY AND
GRACEFUL LITTLE PIECES OF FURNITURE SUITABLE TO YOUNG GIRLS AN ETAGERE
A BOOKCASE FILLED WITH GILT EDGED BOOKS AN INKSTAND A BLOTTING BOOK
PAPER A WORK TABLE INCRUSTED WITH MOTHER OF PEARL A SILVER GILT
DRESSING CASE A TOILET SERVICE IN JAPANESE PORCELAIN
LONG DAMASK
CURTAINS WITH A RED FOUNDATION AND THREE COLORS LIKE THOSE ON THE
BED HUNG AT THE WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR
ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE
CURTAINS WERE OF TAPESTRY
ALL WINTER LONG COSETTE'S LITTLE HOUSE WAS
HEATED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
JEAN VALJEAN INHABITED THE SORT OF PORTER'S
LODGE WHICH WAS SITUATED AT THE END OF THE BACK COURTYARD WITH A
MATTRESS ON A FOLDING BED A WHITE WOOD TABLE TWO STRAW CHAIRS AN
EARTHENWARE WATER JUG A FEW OLD VOLUMES ON A SHELF HIS BELOVED VALISE
IN ONE CORNER AND NEVER ANY FIRE
HE DINED WITH COSETTE AND HE HAD A
LOAF OF BLACK BREAD ON THE TABLE FOR HIS OWN USE
WHEN TOUSSAINT CAME HE HAD SAID TO HER IT IS THE YOUNG LADY WHO IS
THE MISTRESS OF THIS HOUSE AND YOU MONSIEUR TOUSSAINT REPLIED IN
AMAZEMENT I AM A MUCH BETTER THING THAN THE MASTER I AM THE FATHER
COSETTE HAD BEEN TAUGHT HOUSEKEEPING IN THE CONVENT AND SHE REGULATED
THEIR EXPENDITURE WHICH WAS VERY MODEST
EVERY DAY JEAN VALJEAN PUT
HIS ARM THROUGH COSETTE'S AND TOOK HER FOR A WALK
HE LED HER TO THE
LUXEMBOURG TO THE LEAST FREQUENTED WALK AND EVERY SUNDAY HE TOOK HER
TO MASS AT SAINT JACQUES DU HAUT PAS BECAUSE THAT WAS A LONG WAY OFF
AS IT WAS A VERY POOR QUARTER HE BESTOWED ALMS LARGELY THERE AND THE
POOR PEOPLE SURROUNDED HIM IN CHURCH WHICH HAD DRAWN DOWN UPON HIM
THENARDIER'S EPISTLE TO THE BENEVOLENT GENTLEMAN OF THE CHURCH OF
SAINT JACQUES DU HAUT PAS HE WAS FOND OF TAKING COSETTE TO VISIT THE
POOR AND THE SICK
NO STRANGER EVER ENTERED THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET
TOUSSAINT BROUGHT THEIR PROVISIONS AND JEAN VALJEAN WENT HIMSELF FOR
WATER TO A FOUNTAIN NEAR BY ON THE BOULEVARD
THEIR WOOD AND WINE WERE
PUT INTO A HALF SUBTERRANEAN HOLLOW LINED WITH ROCK WORK WHICH LAY NEAR
THE RUE DE BABYLONE AND WHICH HAD FORMERLY SERVED THE CHIEF JUSTICE AS
A GROTTO FOR AT THE EPOCH OF FOLLIES AND LITTLE HOUSES NO LOVE WAS
WITHOUT A GROTTO
IN THE DOOR OPENING ON THE RUE DE BABYLONE THERE WAS A BOX DESTINED FOR
THE RECEPTION OF LETTERS AND PAPERS ONLY AS THE THREE INHABITANTS OF
THE PAVILION IN THE RUE PLUMET RECEIVED NEITHER PAPERS NOR LETTERS THE
ENTIRE USEFULNESS OF THAT BOX FORMERLY THE GO BETWEEN OF A LOVE
AFFAIR AND THE CONFIDANT OF A LOVE LORN LAWYER WAS NOW LIMITED TO
THE TAX COLLECTOR'S NOTICES AND THE SUMMONS OF THE GUARD
FOR M
FAUCHELEVENT INDEPENDENT GENTLEMAN BELONGED TO THE NATIONAL GUARD
HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE THROUGH THE FINE MESHES OF THE CENSUS OF
1831
THE MUNICIPAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AT THAT TIME HAD EVEN REACHED
THE CONVENT OF THE PETIT PICPUS A SORT OF IMPENETRABLE AND HOLY CLOUD
WHENCE JEAN VALJEAN HAD EMERGED IN VENERABLE GUISE AND CONSEQUENTLY
WORTHY OF MOUNTING GUARD IN THE EYES OF THE TOWNHALL
THREE OR FOUR TIMES A YEAR JEAN VALJEAN DONNED HIS UNIFORM AND MOUNTED
GUARD HE DID THIS WILLINGLY HOWEVER IT WAS A CORRECT DISGUISE WHICH
MIXED HIM WITH EVERY ONE AND YET LEFT HIM SOLITARY
JEAN VALJEAN HAD
JUST ATTAINED HIS SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY THE AGE OF LEGAL EXEMPTION BUT HE
DID NOT APPEAR TO BE OVER FIFTY MOREOVER HE HAD NO DESIRE TO ESCAPE
HIS SERGEANT MAJOR NOR TO QUIBBLE WITH COMTE DE LOBAU HE POSSESSED
NO CIVIL STATUS HE WAS CONCEALING HIS NAME HE WAS CONCEALING HIS
IDENTITY SO HE CONCEALED HIS AGE HE CONCEALED EVERYTHING AND AS WE
HAVE JUST SAID HE WILLINGLY DID HIS DUTY AS A NATIONAL GUARD THE SUM
OF HIS AMBITION LAY IN RESEMBLING ANY OTHER MAN WHO PAID HIS TAXES
THIS
MAN HAD FOR HIS IDEAL WITHIN THE ANGEL WITHOUT THE BOURGEOIS
LET US NOTE ONE DETAIL HOWEVER WHEN JEAN VALJEAN WENT OUT WITH
COSETTE HE DRESSED AS THE READER HAS ALREADY SEEN AND HAD THE AIR OF
A RETIRED OFFICER
WHEN HE WENT OUT ALONE WHICH WAS GENERALLY AT NIGHT
HE WAS ALWAYS DRESSED IN A WORKINGMAN'S TROUSERS AND BLOUSE AND WORE
A CAP WHICH CONCEALED HIS FACE
WAS THIS PRECAUTION OR HUMILITY BOTH
COSETTE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO THE ENIGMATICAL SIDE OF HER DESTINY AND
HARDLY NOTICED HER FATHER'S PECULIARITIES
AS FOR TOUSSAINT SHE
VENERATED JEAN VALJEAN AND THOUGHT EVERYTHING HE DID RIGHT
ONE DAY HER BUTCHER WHO HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF JEAN VALJEAN SAID TO
HER THAT'S A QUEER FISH SHE REPLIED HE'S A SAINT
NEITHER JEAN VALJEAN NOR COSETTE NOR TOUSSAINT EVER ENTERED OR EMERGED
EXCEPT BY THE DOOR ON THE RUE DE BABYLONE
UNLESS SEEN THROUGH THE
GARDEN GATE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO GUESS THAT THEY LIVED IN
THE RUE PLUMET
THAT GATE WAS ALWAYS CLOSED
JEAN VALJEAN HAD LEFT THE
GARDEN UNCULTIVATED IN ORDER NOT TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
IN THIS POSSIBLY HE MADE A MISTAKE
CHAPTER III FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS
THE GARDEN THUS LEFT TO ITSELF FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY HAD BECOME
EXTRAORDINARY AND CHARMING
THE PASSERS BY OF FORTY YEARS AGO HALTED TO
GAZE AT IT WITHOUT A SUSPICION OF THE SECRETS WHICH IT HID IN ITS FRESH
AND VERDANT DEPTHS
MORE THAN ONE DREAMER OF THAT EPOCH OFTEN ALLOWED
HIS THOUGHTS AND HIS EYES TO PENETRATE INDISCREETLY BETWEEN THE BARS OF
THAT ANCIENT PADLOCKED GATE TWISTED TOTTERING FASTENED TO TWO
GREEN AND MOSS COVERED PILLARS AND ODDLY CROWNED WITH A PEDIMENT OF
UNDECIPHERABLE ARABESQUE
THERE WAS A STONE BENCH IN ONE CORNER ONE OR TWO MOULDY STATUES
SEVERAL LATTICES WHICH HAD LOST THEIR NAILS WITH TIME WERE ROTTING ON
THE WALL AND THERE WERE NO WALKS NOR TURF BUT THERE WAS ENOUGH GRASS
EVERYWHERE
GARDENING HAD TAKEN ITS DEPARTURE AND NATURE HAD RETURNED
WEEDS ABOUNDED WHICH WAS A GREAT PIECE OF LUCK FOR A POOR CORNER OF
LAND
THE FESTIVAL OF GILLIFLOWERS WAS SOMETHING SPLENDID
NOTHING
IN THIS GARDEN OBSTRUCTED THE SACRED EFFORT OF THINGS TOWARDS LIFE
VENERABLE GROWTH REIGNED THERE AMONG THEM
THE TREES HAD BENT OVER
TOWARDS THE NETTLES THE PLANT HAD SPRUNG UPWARD THE BRANCH HAD
INCLINED THAT WHICH CRAWLS ON THE EARTH HAD GONE IN SEARCH OF THAT
WHICH EXPANDS IN THE AIR THAT WHICH FLOATS ON THE WIND HAD BENT OVER
TOWARDS THAT WHICH TRAILS IN THE MOSS TRUNKS BOUGHS LEAVES FIBRES
CLUSTERS TENDRILS SHOOTS SPINES THORNS HAD MINGLED CROSSED
MARRIED CONFOUNDED THEMSELVES IN EACH OTHER VEGETATION IN A DEEP
AND CLOSE EMBRACE HAD CELEBRATED AND ACCOMPLISHED THERE UNDER THE
WELL PLEASED EYE OF THE CREATOR IN THAT ENCLOSURE THREE HUNDRED FEET
SQUARE THE HOLY MYSTERY OF FRATERNITY SYMBOL OF THE HUMAN FRATERNITY
THIS GARDEN WAS NO LONGER A GARDEN IT WAS A COLOSSAL THICKET THAT IS
TO SAY SOMETHING AS IMPENETRABLE AS A FOREST AS PEOPLED AS A CITY
QUIVERING LIKE A NEST SOMBRE LIKE A CATHEDRAL FRAGRANT LIKE A BOUQUET
SOLITARY AS A TOMB LIVING AS A THRONG
IN FLOREAL 34 THIS ENORMOUS THICKET FREE BEHIND ITS GATE AND WITHIN
ITS FOUR WALLS ENTERED UPON THE SECRET LABOR OF GERMINATION QUIVERED
IN THE RISING SUN ALMOST LIKE AN ANIMAL WHICH DRINKS IN THE BREATHS OF
COSMIC LOVE AND WHICH FEELS THE SAP OF APRIL RISING AND BOILING IN
ITS VEINS AND SHAKES TO THE WIND ITS ENORMOUS WONDERFUL GREEN LOCKS
SPRINKLED ON THE DAMP EARTH ON THE DEFACED STATUES ON THE CRUMBLING
STEPS OF THE PAVILION AND EVEN ON THE PAVEMENT OF THE DESERTED STREET
FLOWERS LIKE STARS DEW LIKE PEARLS FECUNDITY BEAUTY LIFE JOY
PERFUMES
AT MIDDAY A THOUSAND WHITE BUTTERFLIES TOOK REFUGE THERE AND
IT WAS A DIVINE SPECTACLE TO SEE THAT LIVING SUMMER SNOW WHIRLING ABOUT
THERE IN FLAKES AMID THE SHADE
THERE IN THOSE GAY SHADOWS OF VERDURE
A THRONG OF INNOCENT VOICES SPOKE SWEETLY TO THE SOUL AND WHAT THE
TWITTERING FORGOT TO SAY THE HUMMING COMPLETED
IN THE EVENING A DREAMY
VAPOR EXHALED FROM THE GARDEN AND ENVELOPED IT A SHROUD OF MIST A
CALM AND CELESTIAL SADNESS COVERED IT THE INTOXICATING PERFUME OF THE
HONEYSUCKLES AND CONVOLVULUS POURED OUT FROM EVERY PART OF IT LIKE AN
EXQUISITE AND SUBTLE POISON THE LAST APPEALS OF THE WOODPECKERS AND
THE WAGTAILS WERE AUDIBLE AS THEY DOZED AMONG THE BRANCHES ONE FELT THE
SACRED INTIMACY OF THE BIRDS AND THE TREES BY DAY THE WINGS REJOICE THE
LEAVES BY NIGHT THE LEAVES PROTECT THE WINGS
IN WINTER THE THICKET WAS BLACK DRIPPING BRISTLING SHIVERING AND
ALLOWED SOME GLIMPSE OF THE HOUSE
INSTEAD OF FLOWERS ON THE BRANCHES
AND DEW IN THE FLOWERS THE LONG SILVERY TRACKS OF THE SNAILS WERE
VISIBLE ON THE COLD THICK CARPET OF YELLOW LEAVES BUT IN ANY FASHION
UNDER ANY ASPECT AT ALL SEASONS SPRING WINTER SUMMER AUTUMN THIS
TINY ENCLOSURE BREATHED FORTH MELANCHOLY CONTEMPLATION SOLITUDE
LIBERTY THE ABSENCE OF MAN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND THE RUSTY OLD GATE
HAD THE AIR OF SAYING THIS GARDEN BELONGS TO ME
IT WAS OF NO AVAIL THAT THE PAVEMENTS OF PARIS WERE THERE ON EVERY SIDE
THE CLASSIC AND SPLENDID HOTELS OF THE RUE DE VARENNES A COUPLE OF PACES
AWAY THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES CLOSE AT HAND THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES
NOT FAR OFF THE CARRIAGES OF THE RUE DE BOURGOGNE AND OF THE RUE
SAINT DOMINIQUE RUMBLED LUXURIOUSLY IN VAIN IN THE VICINITY IN VAIN
DID THE YELLOW BROWN WHITE AND RED OMNIBUSES CROSS EACH OTHER'S
COURSE AT THE NEIGHBORING CROSS ROADS THE RUE PLUMET WAS THE DESERT
AND THE DEATH OF THE FORMER PROPRIETORS THE REVOLUTION WHICH HAD PASSED
OVER IT THE CRUMBLING AWAY OF ANCIENT FORTUNES ABSENCE FORGETFULNESS
FORTY YEARS OF ABANDONMENT AND WIDOWHOOD HAD SUFFICED TO RESTORE TO
THIS PRIVILEGED SPOT FERNS MULLEINS HEMLOCK YARROW TALL WEEDS GREAT
CRIMPED PLANTS WITH LARGE LEAVES OF PALE GREEN CLOTH LIZARDS BEETLES
UNEASY AND RAPID INSECTS TO CAUSE TO SPRING FORTH FROM THE DEPTHS
OF THE EARTH AND TO REAPPEAR BETWEEN THOSE FOUR WALLS A CERTAIN
INDESCRIBABLE AND SAVAGE GRANDEUR AND FOR NATURE WHICH DISCONCERTS
THE PETTY ARRANGEMENTS OF MAN AND WHICH SHEDS HERSELF ALWAYS THOROUGHLY
WHERE SHE DIFFUSES HERSELF AT ALL IN THE ANT AS WELL AS IN THE EAGLE
TO BLOSSOM OUT IN A PETTY LITTLE PARISIAN GARDEN WITH AS MUCH RUDE FORCE
AND MAJESTY AS IN A VIRGIN FOREST OF THE NEW WORLD
NOTHING IS SMALL IN FACT ANY ONE WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE PROFOUND
AND PENETRATING INFLUENCE OF NATURE KNOWS THIS
ALTHOUGH NO ABSOLUTE
SATISFACTION IS GIVEN TO PHILOSOPHY EITHER TO CIRCUMSCRIBE THE CAUSE
OR TO LIMIT THE EFFECT THE CONTEMPLATOR FALLS INTO THOSE UNFATHOMABLE
ECSTASIES CAUSED BY THESE DECOMPOSITIONS OF FORCE TERMINATING IN UNITY
EVERYTHING TOILS AT EVERYTHING
ALGEBRA IS APPLIED TO THE CLOUDS THE RADIATION OF THE STAR PROFITS
THE ROSE NO THINKER WOULD VENTURE TO AFFIRM THAT THE PERFUME OF THE
HAWTHORN IS USELESS TO THE CONSTELLATIONS
WHO THEN CAN CALCULATE THE
COURSE OF A MOLECULE HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE CREATION OF WORLDS IS NOT
DETERMINED BY THE FALL OF GRAINS OF SAND WHO KNOWS THE RECIPROCAL
EBB AND FLOW OF THE INFINITELY GREAT AND THE INFINITELY LITTLE THE
REVERBERATIONS OF CAUSES IN THE PRECIPICES OF BEING AND THE AVALANCHES
OF CREATION THE TINIEST WORM IS OF IMPORTANCE THE GREAT IS LITTLE THE
LITTLE IS GREAT EVERYTHING IS BALANCED IN NECESSITY ALARMING VISION
FOR THE MIND
THERE ARE MARVELLOUS RELATIONS BETWEEN BEINGS AND THINGS
IN THAT INEXHAUSTIBLE WHOLE FROM THE SUN TO THE GRUB NOTHING DESPISES
THE OTHER ALL HAVE NEED OF EACH OTHER
THE LIGHT DOES NOT BEAR AWAY
TERRESTRIAL PERFUMES INTO THE AZURE DEPTHS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IT IS
DOING THE NIGHT DISTRIBUTES STELLAR ESSENCES TO THE SLEEPING FLOWERS
ALL BIRDS THAT FLY HAVE ROUND THEIR LEG THE THREAD OF THE INFINITE
GERMINATION IS COMPLICATED WITH THE BURSTING FORTH OF A METEOR AND WITH
THE PECK OF A SWALLOW CRACKING ITS EGG AND IT PLACES ON ONE LEVEL THE
BIRTH OF AN EARTHWORM AND THE ADVENT OF SOCRATES
WHERE THE TELESCOPE
ENDS THE MICROSCOPE BEGINS
WHICH OF THE TWO POSSESSES THE LARGER FIELD
OF VISION CHOOSE
A BIT OF MOULD IS A PLEIAD OF FLOWERS A NEBULA IS AN
ANT HILL OF STARS
THE SAME PROMISCUOUSNESS AND YET MORE UNPRECEDENTED
EXISTS BETWEEN THE THINGS OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE FACTS OF
SUBSTANCE
ELEMENTS AND PRINCIPLES MINGLE COMBINE WED MULTIPLY WITH
EACH OTHER TO SUCH A POINT THAT THE MATERIAL AND THE MORAL WORLD ARE
BROUGHT EVENTUALLY TO THE SAME CLEARNESS
THE PHENOMENON IS PERPETUALLY
RETURNING UPON ITSELF
IN THE VAST COSMIC EXCHANGES THE UNIVERSAL LIFE
GOES AND COMES IN UNKNOWN QUANTITIES ROLLING ENTIRELY IN THE INVISIBLE
MYSTERY OF EFFLUVIA EMPLOYING EVERYTHING NOT LOSING A SINGLE DREAM
NOT A SINGLE SLUMBER SOWING AN ANIMALCULE HERE CRUMBLING TO BITS A
PLANET THERE OSCILLATING AND WINDING MAKING OF LIGHT A FORCE AND OF
THOUGHT AN ELEMENT DISSEMINATED AND INVISIBLE DISSOLVING ALL
EXCEPT THAT GEOMETRICAL POINT THE I BRINGING EVERYTHING BACK TO THE
SOUL ATOM EXPANDING EVERYTHING IN GOD ENTANGLING ALL ACTIVITY FROM
SUMMIT TO BASE IN THE OBSCURITY OF A DIZZY MECHANISM ATTACHING THE
FLIGHT OF AN INSECT TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH SUBORDINATING WHO
KNOWS WERE IT ONLY BY THE IDENTITY OF THE LAW THE EVOLUTION OF THE
COMET IN THE FIRMAMENT TO THE WHIRLING OF THE INFUSORIA IN THE DROP
OF WATER
A MACHINE MADE OF MIND
ENORMOUS GEARING THE PRIME MOTOR OF
WHICH IS THE GNAT AND WHOSE FINAL WHEEL IS THE ZODIAC
CHAPTER IV CHANGE OF GATE
IT SEEMED THAT THIS GARDEN CREATED IN OLDEN DAYS TO CONCEAL WANTON
MYSTERIES HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED AND BECOME FITTED TO SHELTER CHASTE
MYSTERIES
THERE WERE NO LONGER EITHER ARBORS OR BOWLING GREENS OR
TUNNELS OR GROTTOS THERE WAS A MAGNIFICENT DISHEVELLED OBSCURITY
FALLING LIKE A VEIL OVER ALL
PAPHOS HAD BEEN MADE OVER INTO EDEN
IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT ELEMENT OF REPENTANCE HAD RENDERED THIS RETREAT
WHOLESOME
THIS FLOWER GIRL NOW OFFERED HER BLOSSOM TO THE SOUL
THIS
COQUETTISH GARDEN FORMERLY DECIDEDLY COMPROMISED HAD RETURNED TO
VIRGINITY AND MODESTY
A JUSTICE ASSISTED BY A GARDENER A GOODMAN WHO
THOUGHT THAT HE WAS A CONTINUATION OF LAMOIGNON AND ANOTHER GOODMAN WHO
THOUGHT THAT HE WAS A CONTINUATION OF LENOTRE HAD TURNED IT ABOUT CUT
RUFFLED DECKED MOULDED IT TO GALLANTRY NATURE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF
IT ONCE MORE HAD FILLED IT WITH SHADE AND HAD ARRANGED IT FOR LOVE
THERE WAS ALSO IN THIS SOLITUDE A HEART WHICH WAS QUITE READY
LOVE
HAD ONLY TO SHOW HIMSELF HE HAD HERE A TEMPLE COMPOSED OF VERDURE
GRASS MOSS THE SIGHT OF BIRDS TENDER SHADOWS AGITATED BRANCHES AND
A SOUL MADE OF SWEETNESS OF FAITH OF CANDOR OF HOPE OF ASPIRATION
AND OF ILLUSION
COSETTE HAD LEFT THE CONVENT WHEN SHE WAS STILL ALMOST A CHILD SHE WAS
A LITTLE MORE THAN FOURTEEN AND SHE WAS AT THE UNGRATEFUL AGE WE
HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER EYES SHE WAS HOMELY
RATHER THAN PRETTY SHE HAD NO UNGRACEFUL FEATURE BUT SHE WAS AWKWARD
THIN TIMID AND BOLD AT ONCE A GROWN UP LITTLE GIRL IN SHORT
HER EDUCATION WAS FINISHED THAT IS TO SAY SHE HAS BEEN TAUGHT
RELIGION AND EVEN AND ABOVE ALL DEVOTION THEN HISTORY THAT IS TO
SAY THE THING THAT BEARS THAT NAME IN CONVENTS GEOGRAPHY GRAMMAR
THE PARTICIPLES THE KINGS OF FRANCE A LITTLE MUSIC A LITTLE DRAWING
ETC BUT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS SHE WAS UTTERLY IGNORANT WHICH IS A
GREAT CHARM AND A GREAT PERIL
THE SOUL OF A YOUNG GIRL SHOULD NOT BE
LEFT IN THE DARK LATER ON MIRAGES THAT ARE TOO ABRUPT AND TOO LIVELY
ARE FORMED THERE AS IN A DARK CHAMBER
SHE SHOULD BE GENTLY AND
DISCREETLY ENLIGHTENED RATHER WITH THE REFLECTION OF REALITIES THAN
WITH THEIR HARSH AND DIRECT LIGHT
A USEFUL AND GRACIOUSLY AUSTERE
HALF LIGHT WHICH DISSIPATES PUERILE FEARS AND OBVIATES FALLS
THERE IS
NOTHING BUT THE MATERNAL INSTINCT THAT ADMIRABLE INTUITION COMPOSED OF
THE MEMORIES OF THE VIRGIN AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE WOMAN WHICH KNOWS
HOW THIS HALF LIGHT IS TO BE CREATED AND OF WHAT IT SHOULD CONSIST
NOTHING SUPPLIES THE PLACE OF THIS INSTINCT
ALL THE NUNS IN THE WORLD
ARE NOT WORTH AS MUCH AS ONE MOTHER IN THE FORMATION OF A YOUNG GIRL'S
SOUL
COSETTE HAD HAD NO MOTHER
SHE HAD ONLY HAD MANY MOTHERS IN THE PLURAL
AS FOR JEAN VALJEAN HE WAS INDEED ALL TENDERNESS ALL SOLICITUDE BUT
HE WAS ONLY AN OLD MAN AND HE KNEW NOTHING AT ALL
NOW IN THIS WORK OF EDUCATION IN THIS GRAVE MATTER OF PREPARING A
WOMAN FOR LIFE WHAT SCIENCE IS REQUIRED TO COMBAT THAT VAST IGNORANCE
WHICH IS CALLED INNOCENCE
NOTHING PREPARES A YOUNG GIRL FOR PASSIONS LIKE THE CONVENT
THE CONVENT
TURNS THE THOUGHTS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE UNKNOWN
THE HEART THUS
THROWN BACK UPON ITSELF WORKS DOWNWARD WITHIN ITSELF SINCE IT CANNOT
OVERFLOW AND GROWS DEEP SINCE IT CANNOT EXPAND
HENCE VISIONS
SUPPOSITIONS CONJECTURES OUTLINES OF ROMANCES A DESIRE FOR
ADVENTURES FANTASTIC CONSTRUCTIONS EDIFICES BUILT WHOLLY IN THE INNER
OBSCURITY OF THE MIND SOMBRE AND SECRET ABODES WHERE THE PASSIONS
IMMEDIATELY FIND A LODGEMENT AS SOON AS THE OPEN GATE PERMITS THEM TO
ENTER
THE CONVENT IS A COMPRESSION WHICH IN ORDER TO TRIUMPH OVER THE
HUMAN HEART SHOULD LAST DURING THE WHOLE LIFE
ON QUITTING THE CONVENT COSETTE COULD HAVE FOUND NOTHING MORE SWEET AND
MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET
IT WAS THE CONTINUATION
OF SOLITUDE WITH THE BEGINNING OF LIBERTY A GARDEN THAT WAS CLOSED BUT
A NATURE THAT WAS ACRID RICH VOLUPTUOUS AND FRAGRANT THE SAME DREAMS
AS IN THE CONVENT BUT WITH GLIMPSES OF YOUNG MEN A GRATING BUT ONE
THAT OPENED ON THE STREET
STILL WHEN SHE ARRIVED THERE WE REPEAT SHE WAS ONLY A CHILD
JEAN
VALJEAN GAVE THIS NEGLECTED GARDEN OVER TO HER
DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH
IT HE SAID TO HER
THIS AMUSED COSETTE SHE TURNED OVER ALL THE CLUMPS
AND ALL THE STONES SHE HUNTED FOR BEASTS SHE PLAYED IN IT WHILE
AWAITING THE TIME WHEN SHE WOULD DREAM IN IT SHE LOVED THIS GARDEN
FOR THE INSECTS THAT SHE FOUND BENEATH HER FEET AMID THE GRASS WHILE
AWAITING THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD LOVE IT FOR THE STARS THAT SHE WOULD SEE
THROUGH THE BOUGHS ABOVE HER HEAD
AND THEN SHE LOVED HER FATHER THAT IS TO SAY JEAN VALJEAN WITH
ALL HER SOUL WITH AN INNOCENT FILIAL PASSION WHICH MADE THE GOODMAN
A BELOVED AND CHARMING COMPANION TO HER
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT M
MADELEINE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF READING A GREAT DEAL
JEAN VALJEAN
HAD CONTINUED THIS PRACTICE HE HAD COME TO CONVERSE WELL HE POSSESSED
THE SECRET RICHES AND THE ELOQUENCE OF A TRUE AND HUMBLE MIND WHICH HAS
SPONTANEOUSLY CULTIVATED ITSELF
HE RETAINED JUST ENOUGH SHARPNESS TO
SEASON HIS KINDNESS HIS MIND WAS ROUGH AND HIS HEART WAS SOFT
DURING
THEIR CONVERSATIONS IN THE LUXEMBOURG HE GAVE HER EXPLANATIONS OF
EVERYTHING DRAWING ON WHAT HE HAD READ AND ALSO ON WHAT HE HAD
SUFFERED
AS SHE LISTENED TO HIM COSETTE'S EYES WANDERED VAGUELY ABOUT
THIS SIMPLE MAN SUFFICED FOR COSETTE'S THOUGHT THE SAME AS THE WILD
GARDEN SUFFICED FOR HER EYES
WHEN SHE HAD HAD A GOOD CHASE AFTER THE
BUTTERFLIES SHE CAME PANTING UP TO HIM AND SAID AH HOW I HAVE RUN
HE KISSED HER BROW
COSETTE ADORED THE GOODMAN
SHE WAS ALWAYS AT HIS HEELS
WHERE JEAN
VALJEAN WAS THERE HAPPINESS WAS
JEAN VALJEAN LIVED NEITHER IN THE
PAVILION NOR THE GARDEN SHE TOOK GREATER PLEASURE IN THE PAVED BACK
COURTYARD THAN IN THE ENCLOSURE FILLED WITH FLOWERS AND IN HIS LITTLE
LODGE FURNISHED WITH STRAW SEATED CHAIRS THAN IN THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM
HUNG WITH TAPESTRY AGAINST WHICH STOOD TUFTED EASY CHAIRS
JEAN VALJEAN
SOMETIMES SAID TO HER SMILING AT HIS HAPPINESS IN BEING IMPORTUNED DO
GO TO YOUR OWN QUARTERS LEAVE ME ALONE A LITTLE
SHE GAVE HIM THOSE CHARMING AND TENDER SCOLDINGS WHICH ARE SO GRACEFUL
WHEN THEY COME FROM A DAUGHTER TO HER FATHER
FATHER I AM VERY COLD IN YOUR ROOMS WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A CARPET HERE
AND A STOVE
DEAR CHILD THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE BETTER THAN I AND WHO HAVE
NOT EVEN A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS
THEN WHY IS THERE A FIRE IN MY ROOMS AND EVERYTHING THAT IS NEEDED
BECAUSE YOU ARE A WOMAN AND A CHILD
BAH MUST MEN BE COLD AND FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
CERTAIN MEN
THAT IS GOOD I SHALL COME HERE SO OFTEN THAT YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO
HAVE A FIRE
AND AGAIN SHE SAID TO HIM
FATHER WHY DO YOU EAT HORRIBLE BREAD LIKE THAT
BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER
WELL IF YOU EAT IT I WILL EAT IT TOO
THEN IN ORDER TO PREVENT COSETTE EATING BLACK BREAD JEAN VALJEAN ATE
WHITE BREAD
COSETTE HAD BUT A CONFUSED RECOLLECTION OF HER CHILDHOOD
SHE PRAYED
MORNING AND EVENING FOR HER MOTHER WHOM SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN
THE
THENARDIERS HAD REMAINED WITH HER AS TWO HIDEOUS FIGURES IN A DREAM
SHE
REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD GONE ONE DAY AT NIGHT TO FETCH WATER IN A
FOREST
SHE THOUGHT THAT IT HAD BEEN VERY FAR FROM PARIS
IT SEEMED TO
HER THAT SHE HAD BEGUN TO LIVE IN AN ABYSS AND THAT IT WAS JEAN VALJEAN
WHO HAD RESCUED HER FROM IT
HER CHILDHOOD PRODUCED UPON HER THE EFFECT
OF A TIME WHEN THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING AROUND HER BUT MILLEPEDS SPIDERS
AND SERPENTS
WHEN SHE MEDITATED IN THE EVENING BEFORE FALLING ASLEEP
AS SHE HAD NOT A VERY CLEAR IDEA THAT SHE WAS JEAN VALJEAN'S DAUGHTER
AND THAT HE WAS HER FATHER SHE FANCIED THAT THE SOUL OF HER MOTHER HAD
PASSED INTO THAT GOOD MAN AND HAD COME TO DWELL NEAR HER
WHEN HE WAS SEATED SHE LEANED HER CHEEK AGAINST HIS WHITE HAIR AND
DROPPED A SILENT TEAR SAYING TO HERSELF PERHAPS THIS MAN IS MY
MOTHER
COSETTE ALTHOUGH THIS IS A STRANGE STATEMENT TO MAKE IN THE PROFOUND
IGNORANCE OF A GIRL BROUGHT UP IN A CONVENT MATERNITY BEING ALSO
ABSOLUTELY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO VIRGINITY HAD ENDED BY FANCYING THAT SHE
HAD HAD AS LITTLE MOTHER AS POSSIBLE
SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW HER MOTHER'S
NAME
WHENEVER SHE ASKED JEAN VALJEAN JEAN VALJEAN REMAINED SILENT
IF
SHE REPEATED HER QUESTION HE RESPONDED WITH A SMILE
ONCE SHE INSISTED
THE SMILE ENDED IN A TEAR
THIS SILENCE ON THE PART OF JEAN VALJEAN COVERED FANTINE WITH DARKNESS
WAS IT PRUDENCE WAS IT RESPECT WAS IT A FEAR THAT HE SHOULD DELIVER
THIS NAME TO THE HAZARDS OF ANOTHER MEMORY THAN HIS OWN
SO LONG AS COSETTE HAD BEEN SMALL JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN WILLING TO TALK
TO HER OF HER MOTHER WHEN SHE BECAME A YOUNG GIRL IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO DO SO
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE NO LONGER DARED
WAS IT
BECAUSE OF COSETTE WAS IT BECAUSE OF FANTINE HE FELT A CERTAIN
RELIGIOUS HORROR AT LETTING THAT SHADOW ENTER COSETTE'S THOUGHT AND OF
PLACING A THIRD IN THEIR DESTINY
THE MORE SACRED THIS SHADE WAS TO HIM
THE MORE DID IT SEEM THAT IT WAS TO BE FEARED
HE THOUGHT OF FANTINE
AND FELT HIMSELF OVERWHELMED WITH SILENCE
THROUGH THE DARKNESS HE VAGUELY PERCEIVED SOMETHING WHICH APPEARED
TO HAVE ITS FINGER ON ITS LIPS
HAD ALL THE MODESTY WHICH HAD BEEN
IN FANTINE AND WHICH HAD VIOLENTLY QUITTED HER DURING HER LIFETIME
RETURNED TO REST UPON HER AFTER HER DEATH TO WATCH IN INDIGNATION OVER
THE PEACE OF THAT DEAD WOMAN AND IN ITS SHYNESS TO KEEP HER IN HER
GRAVE WAS JEAN VALJEAN UNCONSCIOUSLY SUBMITTING TO THE PRESSURE WE
WHO BELIEVE IN DEATH ARE NOT AMONG THE NUMBER WHO WILL REJECT THIS
MYSTERIOUS EXPLANATION
HENCE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF UTTERING EVEN FOR COSETTE THAT NAME OF
FANTINE
ONE DAY COSETTE SAID TO HIM
FATHER I SAW MY MOTHER IN A DREAM LAST NIGHT
SHE HAD TWO BIG WINGS
MY MOTHER MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST A SAINT DURING HER LIFE
THROUGH MARTYRDOM REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN
HOWEVER JEAN VALJEAN WAS HAPPY
WHEN COSETTE WENT OUT WITH HIM SHE LEANED ON HIS ARM PROUD AND HAPPY
IN THE PLENITUDE OF HER HEART
JEAN VALJEAN FELT HIS HEART MELT WITHIN
HIM WITH DELIGHT AT ALL THESE SPARKS OF A TENDERNESS SO EXCLUSIVE SO
WHOLLY SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF ALONE
THE POOR MAN TREMBLED INUNDATED
WITH ANGELIC JOY HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF ECSTATICALLY THAT THIS WOULD
LAST ALL THEIR LIVES HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE REALLY HAD NOT SUFFERED
SUFFICIENTLY TO MERIT SO RADIANT A BLISS AND HE THANKED GOD IN THE
DEPTHS OF HIS SOUL FOR HAVING PERMITTED HIM TO BE LOVED THUS HE A
WRETCH BY THAT INNOCENT BEING
CHAPTER V THE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR
ONE DAY COSETTE CHANCED TO LOOK AT HERSELF IN HER MIRROR AND SHE SAID
TO HERSELF REALLY IT SEEMED TO HER ALMOST THAT SHE WAS PRETTY
THIS
THREW HER IN A SINGULARLY TROUBLED STATE OF MIND
UP TO THAT MOMENT SHE
HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HER FACE
SHE SAW HERSELF IN HER MIRROR BUT SHE
DID NOT LOOK AT HERSELF
AND THEN SHE HAD SO OFTEN BEEN TOLD THAT SHE
WAS HOMELY JEAN VALJEAN ALONE SAID GENTLY NO INDEED NO INDEED AT
ALL EVENTS COSETTE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HERSELF HOMELY AND HAD GROWN UP
IN THAT BELIEF WITH THE EASY RESIGNATION OF CHILDHOOD
AND HERE ALL
AT ONCE WAS HER MIRROR SAYING TO HER AS JEAN VALJEAN HAD SAID NO
INDEED THAT NIGHT SHE DID NOT SLEEP
WHAT IF I WERE PRETTY SHE
THOUGHT
HOW ODD IT WOULD BE IF I WERE PRETTY AND SHE RECALLED THOSE
OF HER COMPANIONS WHOSE BEAUTY HAD PRODUCED A SENSATION IN THE CONVENT
AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF WHAT AM I TO BE LIKE MADEMOISELLE SO AND SO
THE NEXT MORNING SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF AGAIN NOT BY ACCIDENT THIS TIME
AND SHE WAS ASSAILED WITH DOUBTS WHERE DID I GET SUCH AN IDEA SAID
SHE NO I AM UGLY SHE HAD NOT SLEPT WELL THAT WAS ALL HER EYES
WERE SUNKEN AND SHE WAS PALE
SHE HAD NOT FELT VERY JOYOUS ON THE
PRECEDING EVENING IN THE BELIEF THAT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT IT MADE HER
VERY SAD NOT TO BE ABLE TO BELIEVE IN IT ANY LONGER
SHE DID NOT LOOK AT
HERSELF AGAIN AND FOR MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT SHE TRIED TO DRESS HER HAIR
WITH HER BACK TURNED TO THE MIRROR
IN THE EVENING AFTER DINNER SHE GENERALLY EMBROIDERED IN WOOL OR
DID SOME CONVENT NEEDLEWORK IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND JEAN VALJEAN READ
BESIDE HER
ONCE SHE RAISED HER EYES FROM HER WORK AND WAS RENDERED
QUITE UNEASY BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HER FATHER WAS GAZING AT HER
ON ANOTHER OCCASION SHE WAS PASSING ALONG THE STREET AND IT SEEMED
TO HER THAT SOME ONE BEHIND HER WHOM SHE DID NOT SEE SAID A PRETTY
WOMAN BUT BADLY DRESSED BAH SHE THOUGHT HE DOES NOT MEAN ME
I AM WELL DRESSED AND UGLY SHE WAS THEN WEARING A PLUSH HAT AND HER
MERINO GOWN
AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS IN THE GARDEN SHE HEARD POOR OLD
TOUSSAINT SAYING DO YOU NOTICE HOW PRETTY COSETTE IS GROWING SIR
COSETTE DID NOT HEAR HER FATHER'S REPLY BUT TOUSSAINT'S WORDS CAUSED
A SORT OF COMMOTION WITHIN HER
SHE FLED FROM THE GARDEN RAN UP TO
HER ROOM FLEW TO THE LOOKING GLASS IT WAS THREE MONTHS SINCE SHE
HAD LOOKED AT HERSELF AND GAVE VENT TO A CRY
SHE HAD JUST DAZZLED
HERSELF
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND LOVELY SHE COULD NOT HELP AGREEING WITH TOUSSAINT
AND HER MIRROR
HER FIGURE WAS FORMED HER SKIN HAD GROWN WHITE HER
HAIR WAS LUSTROUS AN UNACCUSTOMED SPLENDOR HAD BEEN LIGHTED IN HER BLUE
EYES
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER BEAUTY BURST UPON HER IN AN INSTANT LIKE
THE SUDDEN ADVENT OF DAYLIGHT OTHER PEOPLE NOTICED IT ALSO TOUSSAINT
HAD SAID SO IT WAS EVIDENTLY SHE OF WHOM THE PASSER BY HAD SPOKEN
THERE COULD NO LONGER BE ANY DOUBT OF THAT SHE DESCENDED TO THE GARDEN
AGAIN THINKING HERSELF A QUEEN IMAGINING THAT SHE HEARD THE BIRDS
SINGING THOUGH IT WAS WINTER SEEING THE SKY GILDED THE SUN AMONG
THE TREES FLOWERS IN THE THICKETS DISTRACTED WILD IN INEXPRESSIBLE
DELIGHT
JEAN VALJEAN ON HIS SIDE EXPERIENCED A DEEP AND UNDEFINABLE OPPRESSION
AT HEART
IN FACT HE HAD FOR SOME TIME PAST BEEN CONTEMPLATING WITH TERROR THAT
BEAUTY WHICH SEEMED TO GROW MORE RADIANT EVERY DAY ON COSETTE'S SWEET
FACE
THE DAWN THAT WAS SMILING FOR ALL WAS GLOOMY FOR HIM
COSETTE HAD BEEN BEAUTIFUL FOR A TOLERABLY LONG TIME BEFORE SHE BECAME
AWARE OF IT HERSELF
BUT FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT UNEXPECTED LIGHT
WHICH WAS RISING SLOWLY AND ENVELOPING THE WHOLE OF THE YOUNG GIRL'S
PERSON WOUNDED JEAN VALJEAN'S SOMBRE EYE
HE FELT THAT IT WAS A CHANGE
IN A HAPPY LIFE A LIFE SO HAPPY THAT HE DID NOT DARE TO MOVE FOR FEAR
OF DISARRANGING SOMETHING
THIS MAN WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH ALL MANNER
OF DISTRESSES WHO WAS STILL ALL BLEEDING FROM THE BRUISES OF FATE WHO
HAD BEEN ALMOST WICKED AND WHO HAD BECOME ALMOST A SAINT WHO AFTER
HAVING DRAGGED THE CHAIN OF THE GALLEYS WAS NOW DRAGGING THE INVISIBLE
BUT HEAVY CHAIN OF INDEFINITE MISERY THIS MAN WHOM THE LAW HAD NOT
RELEASED FROM ITS GRASP AND WHO COULD BE SEIZED AT ANY MOMENT AND
BROUGHT BACK FROM THE OBSCURITY OF HIS VIRTUE TO THE BROAD DAYLIGHT OF
PUBLIC OPPROBRIUM THIS MAN ACCEPTED ALL EXCUSED ALL PARDONED ALL AND
MERELY ASKED OF PROVIDENCE OF MAN OF THE LAW OF SOCIETY OF NATURE
OF THE WORLD ONE THING THAT COSETTE MIGHT LOVE HIM
THAT COSETTE MIGHT CONTINUE TO LOVE HIM THAT GOD WOULD NOT PREVENT
THE HEART OF THE CHILD FROM COMING TO HIM AND FROM REMAINING WITH HIM
BELOVED BY COSETTE HE FELT THAT HE WAS HEALED RESTED APPEASED LOADED
WITH BENEFITS RECOMPENSED CROWNED
BELOVED BY COSETTE IT WAS WELL
WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING MORE HAD ANY ONE SAID TO HIM DO YOU WANT
ANYTHING BETTER HE WOULD HAVE ANSWERED NO GOD MIGHT HAVE SAID TO
HIM DO YOU DESIRE HEAVEN AND HE WOULD HAVE REPLIED I SHOULD LOSE
BY IT
EVERYTHING WHICH COULD AFFECT THIS SITUATION IF ONLY ON THE SURFACE
MADE HIM SHUDDER LIKE THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING NEW
HE HAD NEVER
KNOWN VERY DISTINCTLY HIMSELF WHAT THE BEAUTY OF A WOMAN MEANS BUT HE
UNDERSTOOD INSTINCTIVELY THAT IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HE GAZED WITH TERROR ON THIS BEAUTY WHICH WAS BLOSSOMING OUT EVER MORE
TRIUMPHANT AND SUPERB BESIDE HIM BENEATH HIS VERY EYES ON THE INNOCENT
AND FORMIDABLE BROW OF THAT CHILD FROM THE DEPTHS OF HER HOMELINESS OF
HIS OLD AGE OF HIS MISERY OF HIS REPROBATION
HE SAID TO HIMSELF HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME
THERE MOREOVER LAY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS TENDERNESS AND THE
TENDERNESS OF A MOTHER
WHAT HE BEHELD WITH ANGUISH A MOTHER WOULD HAVE
GAZED UPON WITH JOY
THE FIRST SYMPTOMS WERE NOT LONG IN MAKING THEIR APPEARANCE
ON THE VERY MORROW OF THE DAY ON WHICH SHE HAD SAID TO HERSELF
DECIDEDLY I AM BEAUTIFUL COSETTE BEGAN TO PAY ATTENTION TO HER
TOILET
SHE RECALLED THE REMARK OF THAT PASSER BY PRETTY BUT BADLY
DRESSED THE BREATH OF AN ORACLE WHICH HAD PASSED BESIDE HER AND HAD
VANISHED AFTER DEPOSITING IN HER HEART ONE OF THE TWO GERMS WHICH ARE
DESTINED LATER ON TO FILL THE WHOLE LIFE OF WOMAN COQUETRY
LOVE IS
THE OTHER
WITH FAITH IN HER BEAUTY THE WHOLE FEMININE SOUL EXPANDED WITHIN HER
SHE CONCEIVED A HORROR FOR HER MERINOS AND SHAME FOR HER PLUSH HAT
HER
FATHER HAD NEVER REFUSED HER ANYTHING
SHE AT ONCE ACQUIRED THE WHOLE
SCIENCE OF THE BONNET THE GOWN THE MANTLE THE BOOT THE CUFF THE
STUFF WHICH IS IN FASHION THE COLOR WHICH IS BECOMING THAT SCIENCE
WHICH MAKES OF THE PARISIAN WOMAN SOMETHING SO CHARMING SO DEEP AND SO
DANGEROUS
THE WORDS HEADY WOMAN WERE INVENTED FOR THE PARISIENNE
IN LESS THAN A MONTH LITTLE COSETTE IN THAT THEBAID OF THE RUE DE
BABYLONE WAS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE PRETTIEST BUT ONE OF THE BEST
DRESSED WOMEN IN PARIS WHICH MEANS A GREAT DEAL MORE
SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO ENCOUNTER HER PASSER BY TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD
SAY AND TO TEACH HIM A LESSON THE TRUTH IS THAT SHE WAS RAVISHING
IN EVERY RESPECT AND THAT SHE DISTINGUISHED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
BONNET FROM GERARD AND ONE FROM HERBAUT IN THE MOST MARVELLOUS WAY
JEAN VALJEAN WATCHED THESE RAVAGES WITH ANXIETY
HE WHO FELT THAT
HE COULD NEVER DO ANYTHING BUT CRAWL WALK AT THE MOST BEHELD WINGS
SPROUTING ON COSETTE
MOREOVER FROM THE MERE INSPECTION OF COSETTE'S TOILET A WOMAN
WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT SHE HAD NO MOTHER
CERTAIN LITTLE
PROPRIETIES CERTAIN SPECIAL CONVENTIONALITIES WERE NOT OBSERVED BY
COSETTE
A MOTHER FOR INSTANCE WOULD HAVE TOLD HER THAT A YOUNG GIRL
DOES NOT DRESS IN DAMASK
THE FIRST DAY THAT COSETTE WENT OUT IN HER BLACK DAMASK GOWN AND MANTLE
AND HER WHITE CRAPE BONNET SHE TOOK JEAN VALJEAN'S ARM GAY RADIANT
ROSY PROUD DAZZLING
FATHER SHE SAID HOW DO YOU LIKE ME IN THIS
GUISE JEAN VALJEAN REPLIED IN A VOICE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BITTER VOICE
OF AN ENVIOUS MAN CHARMING HE WAS THE SAME AS USUAL DURING THEIR
WALK
ON THEIR RETURN HOME HE ASKED COSETTE
WON'T YOU PUT ON THAT OTHER GOWN AND BONNET AGAIN YOU KNOW THE ONES I
MEAN
THIS TOOK PLACE IN COSETTE'S CHAMBER
COSETTE TURNED TOWARDS THE
WARDROBE WHERE HER CAST OFF SCHOOLGIRL'S CLOTHES WERE HANGING
THAT DISGUISE SAID SHE
FATHER WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH IT
OH NO THE IDEA I SHALL NEVER PUT ON THOSE HORRORS AGAIN
WITH THAT
MACHINE ON MY HEAD I HAVE THE AIR OF MADAME MAD DOG
JEAN VALJEAN HEAVED A DEEP SIGH
FROM THAT MOMENT FORTH HE NOTICED THAT COSETTE WHO HAD ALWAYS
HERETOFORE ASKED TO REMAIN AT HOME SAYING FATHER I ENJOY MYSELF MORE
HERE WITH YOU NOW WAS ALWAYS ASKING TO GO OUT
IN FACT WHAT IS THE
USE OF HAVING A HANDSOME FACE AND A DELICIOUS COSTUME IF ONE DOES NOT
DISPLAY THEM
HE ALSO NOTICED THAT COSETTE HAD NO LONGER THE SAME TASTE FOR THE BACK
GARDEN
NOW SHE PREFERRED THE GARDEN AND DID NOT DISLIKE TO PROMENADE
BACK AND FORTH IN FRONT OF THE RAILED FENCE
JEAN VALJEAN WHO WAS SHY
NEVER SET FOOT IN THE GARDEN
HE KEPT TO HIS BACK YARD LIKE A DOG
COSETTE IN GAINING THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL LOST THE GRACE
OF IGNORING IT
AN EXQUISITE GRACE FOR BEAUTY ENHANCED BY INGENUOUSNESS
IS INEFFABLE AND NOTHING IS SO ADORABLE AS A DAZZLING AND INNOCENT
CREATURE WHO WALKS ALONG HOLDING IN HER HAND THE KEY TO PARADISE
WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF IT
BUT WHAT SHE HAD LOST IN INGENUOUS GRACE
SHE GAINED IN PENSIVE AND SERIOUS CHARM
HER WHOLE PERSON PERMEATED
WITH THE JOY OF YOUTH OF INNOCENCE AND OF BEAUTY BREATHED FORTH A
SPLENDID MELANCHOLY
IT WAS AT THIS EPOCH THAT MARIUS AFTER THE LAPSE OF SIX MONTHS SAW HER
ONCE MORE AT THE LUXEMBOURG
CHAPTER VI THE BATTLE BEGUN
COSETTE IN HER SHADOW LIKE MARIUS IN HIS WAS ALL READY TO TAKE FIRE
DESTINY WITH ITS MYSTERIOUS AND FATAL PATIENCE SLOWLY DREW TOGETHER
THESE TWO BEINGS ALL CHARGED AND ALL LANGUISHING WITH THE STORMY
ELECTRICITY OF PASSION THESE TWO SOULS WHICH WERE LADEN WITH LOVE AS
TWO CLOUDS ARE LADEN WITH LIGHTNING AND WHICH WERE BOUND TO OVERFLOW
AND MINGLE IN A LOOK LIKE THE CLOUDS IN A FLASH OF FIRE
THE GLANCE HAS BEEN SO MUCH ABUSED IN LOVE ROMANCES THAT IT HAS FINALLY
FALLEN INTO DISREPUTE
ONE HARDLY DARES TO SAY NOWADAYS THAT TWO
BEINGS FELL IN LOVE BECAUSE THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
THAT IS THE WAY
PEOPLE DO FALL IN LOVE NEVERTHELESS AND THE ONLY WAY
THE REST IS
NOTHING BUT THE REST COMES AFTERWARDS
NOTHING IS MORE REAL THAN THESE
GREAT SHOCKS WHICH TWO SOULS CONVEY TO EACH OTHER BY THE EXCHANGE OF
THAT SPARK
AT THAT PARTICULAR HOUR WHEN COSETTE UNCONSCIOUSLY DARTED THAT GLANCE
WHICH TROUBLED MARIUS MARIUS HAD NO SUSPICION THAT HE HAD ALSO LAUNCHED
A LOOK WHICH DISTURBED COSETTE
HE CAUSED HER THE SAME GOOD AND THE SAME EVIL
SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SEEING HIM FOR A LONG TIME AND SHE HAD
SCRUTINIZED HIM AS GIRLS SCRUTINIZE AND SEE WHILE LOOKING ELSEWHERE
MARIUS STILL CONSIDERED COSETTE UGLY WHEN SHE HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO
THINK MARIUS HANDSOME
BUT AS HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER THE YOUNG MAN
WAS NOTHING TO HER
STILL SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING TO HERSELF THAT HE HAD
BEAUTIFUL HAIR BEAUTIFUL EYES HANDSOME TEETH A CHARMING TONE OF VOICE
WHEN SHE HEARD HIM CONVERSING WITH HIS COMRADES THAT HE HELD HIMSELF
BADLY WHEN HE WALKED IF YOU LIKE BUT WITH A GRACE THAT WAS ALL HIS
OWN THAT HE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE AT ALL STUPID THAT HIS WHOLE PERSON
WAS NOBLE GENTLE SIMPLE PROUD AND THAT IN SHORT THOUGH HE SEEMED
TO BE POOR YET HIS AIR WAS FINE
ON THE DAY WHEN THEIR EYES MET AT LAST AND SAID TO EACH OTHER THOSE
FIRST OBSCURE AND INEFFABLE THINGS WHICH THE GLANCE LISPS COSETTE DID
NOT IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND
SHE RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY TO THE HOUSE IN
THE RUE DE L'OUEST WHERE JEAN VALJEAN ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM HAD
COME TO SPEND SIX WEEKS
THE NEXT MORNING ON WAKING SHE THOUGHT OF
THAT STRANGE YOUNG MAN SO LONG INDIFFERENT AND ICY WHO NOW SEEMED TO
PAY ATTENTION TO HER AND IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HER THAT THIS ATTENTION
WAS THE LEAST IN THE WORLD AGREEABLE TO HER
SHE WAS ON THE CONTRARY
SOMEWHAT INCENSED AT THIS HANDSOME AND DISDAINFUL INDIVIDUAL
A
SUBSTRATUM OF WAR STIRRED WITHIN HER
IT STRUCK HER AND THE IDEA CAUSED
HER A WHOLLY CHILDISH JOY THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE HER REVENGE AT
LAST
KNOWING THAT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS THOROUGHLY CONSCIOUS THOUGH
IN AN INDISTINCT FASHION THAT SHE POSSESSED A WEAPON
WOMEN PLAY WITH
THEIR BEAUTY AS CHILDREN DO WITH A KNIFE
THEY WOUND THEMSELVES
THE READER WILL RECALL MARIUS' HESITATIONS HIS PALPITATIONS HIS
TERRORS
HE REMAINED ON HIS BENCH AND DID NOT APPROACH
THIS VEXED
COSETTE
ONE DAY SHE SAID TO JEAN VALJEAN FATHER LET US STROLL ABOUT
A LITTLE IN THAT DIRECTION SEEING THAT MARIUS DID NOT COME TO HER
SHE WENT TO HIM
IN SUCH CASES ALL WOMEN RESEMBLE MAHOMET
AND THEN
STRANGE TO SAY THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF TRUE LOVE IN A YOUNG MAN IS
TIMIDITY IN A YOUNG GIRL IT IS BOLDNESS
THIS IS SURPRISING AND YET
NOTHING IS MORE SIMPLE
IT IS THE TWO SEXES TENDING TO APPROACH EACH
OTHER AND ASSUMING EACH THE OTHER'S QUALITIES
THAT DAY COSETTE'S GLANCE DROVE MARIUS BESIDE HIMSELF AND MARIUS'
GLANCE SET COSETTE TO TREMBLING
MARIUS WENT AWAY CONFIDENT AND COSETTE
UNEASY
FROM THAT DAY FORTH THEY ADORED EACH OTHER
THE FIRST THING THAT COSETTE FELT WAS A CONFUSED AND PROFOUND
MELANCHOLY
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT HER SOUL HAD BECOME BLACK SINCE THE
DAY BEFORE
SHE NO LONGER RECOGNIZED IT
THE WHITENESS OF SOUL IN YOUNG
GIRLS WHICH IS COMPOSED OF COLDNESS AND GAYETY RESEMBLES SNOW
IT
MELTS IN LOVE WHICH IS ITS SUN
COSETTE DID NOT KNOW WHAT LOVE WAS
SHE HAD NEVER HEARD THE WORD UTTERED
IN ITS TERRESTRIAL SENSE
ON THE BOOKS OF PROFANE MUSIC WHICH ENTERED
THE CONVENT AMOUR LOVE WAS REPLACED BY TAMBOUR DRUM OR PANDOUR
THIS CREATED ENIGMAS WHICH EXERCISED THE IMAGINATIONS OF THE BIG GIRLS
SUCH AS AH HOW DELIGHTFUL IS THE DRUM OR PITY IS NOT A PANDOUR
BUT
COSETTE HAD LEFT THE CONVENT TOO EARLY TO HAVE OCCUPIED HERSELF MUCH
WITH THE DRUM THEREFORE SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT NAME TO GIVE TO WHAT
SHE NOW FELT
IS ANY ONE THE LESS ILL BECAUSE ONE DOES NOT KNOW THE NAME
OF ONE'S MALADY
SHE LOVED WITH ALL THE MORE PASSION BECAUSE SHE LOVED IGNORANTLY
SHE
DID NOT KNOW WHETHER IT WAS A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING USEFUL OR
DANGEROUS ETERNAL OR TEMPORARY ALLOWABLE OR PROHIBITED SHE LOVED
SHE
WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ASTONISHED HAD ANY ONE SAID TO HER YOU DO NOT
SLEEP BUT THAT IS FORBIDDEN YOU DO NOT EAT WHY THAT IS VERY BAD YOU
HAVE OPPRESSIONS AND PALPITATIONS OF THE HEART THAT MUST NOT BE YOU
BLUSH AND TURN PALE WHEN A CERTAIN BEING CLAD IN BLACK APPEARS AT THE
END OF A CERTAIN GREEN WALK BUT THAT IS ABOMINABLE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE
UNDERSTOOD AND SHE WOULD HAVE REPLIED WHAT FAULT IS THERE OF MINE IN
A MATTER IN WHICH I HAVE NO POWER AND OF WHICH I KNOW NOTHING
IT TURNED OUT THAT THE LOVE WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF WAS EXACTLY SUITED TO
THE STATE OF HER SOUL
IT WAS A SORT OF ADMIRATION AT A DISTANCE A MUTE
CONTEMPLATION THE DEIFICATION OF A STRANGER
IT WAS THE APPARITION OF
YOUTH TO YOUTH THE DREAM OF NIGHTS BECOME A REALITY YET REMAINING
A DREAM THE LONGED FOR PHANTOM REALIZED AND MADE FLESH AT LAST BUT
HAVING AS YET NEITHER NAME NOR FAULT NOR SPOT NOR EXIGENCE NOR
DEFECT IN A WORD THE DISTANT LOVER WHO LINGERED IN THE IDEAL A
CHIMAERA WITH A FORM
ANY NEARER AND MORE PALPABLE MEETING WOULD HAVE
ALARMED COSETTE AT THIS FIRST STAGE WHEN SHE WAS STILL HALF IMMERSED IN
THE EXAGGERATED MISTS OF THE CLOISTER
SHE HAD ALL THE FEARS OF CHILDREN
AND ALL THE FEARS OF NUNS COMBINED
THE SPIRIT OF THE CONVENT WITH
WHICH SHE HAD BEEN PERMEATED FOR THE SPACE OF FIVE YEARS WAS STILL IN
THE PROCESS OF SLOW EVAPORATION FROM HER PERSON AND MADE EVERYTHING
TREMBLE AROUND HER
IN THIS SITUATION HE WAS NOT A LOVER HE WAS NOT
EVEN AN ADMIRER HE WAS A VISION
SHE SET HERSELF TO ADORING MARIUS AS
SOMETHING CHARMING LUMINOUS AND IMPOSSIBLE
AS EXTREME INNOCENCE BORDERS ON EXTREME COQUETRY SHE SMILED AT HIM WITH
ALL FRANKNESS
EVERY DAY SHE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE HOUR FOR THEIR WALK WITH
IMPATIENCE SHE FOUND MARIUS THERE SHE FELT HERSELF UNSPEAKABLY HAPPY
AND THOUGHT IN ALL SINCERITY THAT SHE WAS EXPRESSING HER WHOLE THOUGHT
WHEN SHE SAID TO JEAN VALJEAN
WHAT A DELICIOUS GARDEN THAT LUXEMBOURG IS
MARIUS AND COSETTE WERE IN THE DARK AS TO ONE ANOTHER
THEY DID NOT
ADDRESS EACH OTHER THEY DID NOT SALUTE EACH OTHER THEY DID NOT KNOW
EACH OTHER THEY SAW EACH OTHER AND LIKE STARS OF HEAVEN WHICH ARE
SEPARATED BY MILLIONS OF LEAGUES THEY LIVED BY GAZING AT EACH OTHER
IT WAS THUS THAT COSETTE GRADUALLY BECAME A WOMAN AND DEVELOPED
BEAUTIFUL AND LOVING WITH A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER BEAUTY AND IN
IGNORANCE OF HER LOVE
SHE WAS A COQUETTE TO BOOT THROUGH HER IGNORANCE
CHAPTER VII TO ONE SADNESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALF
ALL SITUATIONS HAVE THEIR INSTINCTS
OLD AND ETERNAL MOTHER NATURE
WARNED JEAN VALJEAN IN A DIM WAY OF THE PRESENCE OF MARIUS
JEAN VALJEAN
SHUDDERED TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS SOUL
JEAN VALJEAN SAW NOTHING KNEW
NOTHING AND YET HE SCANNED WITH OBSTINATE ATTENTION THE DARKNESS
IN WHICH HE WALKED AS THOUGH HE FELT ON ONE SIDE OF HIM SOMETHING IN
PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND ON THE OTHER SOMETHING WHICH WAS CRUMBLING
AWAY
MARIUS ALSO WARNED AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DEEP LAW OF GOD
BY THAT SAME MOTHER NATURE DID ALL HE COULD TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT OF
THE FATHER NEVERTHELESS IT CAME TO PASS THAT JEAN VALJEAN SOMETIMES
ESPIED HIM
MARIUS' MANNERS WERE NO LONGER IN THE LEAST NATURAL
HE
EXHIBITED AMBIGUOUS PRUDENCE AND AWKWARD DARING
HE NO LONGER CAME QUITE
CLOSE TO THEM AS FORMERLY
HE SEATED HIMSELF AT A DISTANCE AND PRETENDED
TO BE READING WHY DID HE PRETEND THAT FORMERLY HE HAD COME IN HIS OLD
COAT NOW HE WORE HIS NEW ONE EVERY DAY JEAN VALJEAN WAS NOT SURE
THAT HE DID NOT HAVE HIS HAIR CURLED HIS EYES WERE VERY QUEER HE WORE
GLOVES IN SHORT JEAN VALJEAN CORDIALLY DETESTED THIS YOUNG MAN
COSETTE ALLOWED NOTHING TO BE DIVINED
WITHOUT KNOWING JUST WHAT WAS THE
MATTER WITH HER SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN IT AND
THAT IT MUST BE CONCEALED
THERE WAS A COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THE TASTE FOR THE TOILET WHICH HAD
RECENTLY COME TO COSETTE AND THE HABIT OF NEW CLOTHES DEVELOPED BY
THAT STRANGER WHICH WAS VERY REPUGNANT TO JEAN VALJEAN
IT MIGHT BE
ACCIDENTAL NO DOUBT CERTAINLY BUT IT WAS A MENACING ACCIDENT
HE NEVER OPENED HIS MOUTH TO COSETTE ABOUT THIS STRANGER
ONE DAY
HOWEVER HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SO DOING AND WITH THAT VAGUE
DESPAIR WHICH SUDDENLY CASTS THE LEAD INTO THE DEPTHS OF ITS DESPAIR HE
SAID TO HER WHAT A VERY PEDANTIC AIR THAT YOUNG MAN HAS
COSETTE BUT A YEAR BEFORE ONLY AN INDIFFERENT LITTLE GIRL WOULD HAVE
REPLIED WHY NO HE IS CHARMING TEN YEARS LATER WITH THE LOVE
OF MARIUS IN HER HEART SHE WOULD HAVE ANSWERED A PEDANT AND
INSUFFERABLE TO THE SIGHT YOU ARE RIGHT AT THE MOMENT IN LIFE
AND THE HEART WHICH SHE HAD THEN ATTAINED SHE CONTENTED HERSELF WITH
REPLYING WITH SUPREME CALMNESS THAT YOUNG MAN
AS THOUGH SHE NOW BEHELD HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE
HOW STUPID I AM THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN
SHE HAD NOT NOTICED HIM
IT IS
I WHO HAVE POINTED HIM OUT TO HER
OH SIMPLICITY OF THE OLD OH THE DEPTH OF CHILDREN
IT IS ONE OF THE LAWS OF THOSE FRESH YEARS OF SUFFERING AND TROUBLE OF
THOSE VIVACIOUS CONFLICTS BETWEEN A FIRST LOVE AND THE FIRST OBSTACLES
THAT THE YOUNG GIRL DOES NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO BE CAUGHT IN ANY TRAP
WHATEVER AND THAT THE YOUNG MAN FALLS INTO EVERY ONE
JEAN VALJEAN
HAD INSTITUTED AN UNDECLARED WAR AGAINST MARIUS WHICH MARIUS WITH
THE SUBLIME STUPIDITY OF HIS PASSION AND HIS AGE DID NOT DIVINE
JEAN
VALJEAN LAID A HOST OF AMBUSHES FOR HIM HE CHANGED HIS HOUR HE CHANGED
HIS BENCH HE FORGOT HIS HANDKERCHIEF HE CAME ALONE TO THE LUXEMBOURG
MARIUS DASHED HEADLONG INTO ALL THESE SNARES AND TO ALL THE
INTERROGATION MARKS PLANTED BY JEAN VALJEAN IN HIS PATHWAY HE
INGENUOUSLY ANSWERED YES BUT COSETTE REMAINED IMMURED IN HER APPARENT
UNCONCERN AND IN HER IMPERTURBABLE TRANQUILLITY SO THAT JEAN VALJEAN
ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION THAT NINNY IS MADLY IN LOVE WITH
COSETTE BUT COSETTE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW THAT HE EXISTS
NONE THE LESS DID HE BEAR IN HIS HEART A MOURNFUL TREMOR
THE MINUTE
WHEN COSETTE WOULD LOVE MIGHT STRIKE AT ANY MOMENT
DOES NOT EVERYTHING
BEGIN WITH INDIFFERENCE
ONLY ONCE DID COSETTE MAKE A MISTAKE AND ALARM HIM
HE ROSE FROM HIS
SEAT TO DEPART AFTER A STAY OF THREE HOURS AND SHE SAID WHAT
ALREADY
JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT DISCONTINUED HIS TRIPS TO THE LUXEMBOURG AS HE
DID NOT WISH TO DO ANYTHING OUT OF THE WAY AND AS ABOVE ALL THINGS
HE FEARED TO AROUSE COSETTE BUT DURING THE HOURS WHICH WERE SO SWEET
TO THE LOVERS WHILE COSETTE WAS SENDING HER SMILE TO THE INTOXICATED
MARIUS WHO PERCEIVED NOTHING ELSE NOW AND WHO NOW SAW NOTHING IN ALL
THE WORLD BUT AN ADORED AND RADIANT FACE JEAN VALJEAN WAS FIXING ON
MARIUS FLASHING AND TERRIBLE EYES
HE WHO HAD FINALLY COME TO BELIEVE
HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF A MALEVOLENT FEELING EXPERIENCED MOMENTS WHEN
MARIUS WAS PRESENT IN WHICH HE THOUGHT HE WAS BECOMING SAVAGE AND
FEROCIOUS ONCE MORE AND HE FELT THE OLD DEPTHS OF HIS SOUL WHICH
HAD FORMERLY CONTAINED SO MUCH WRATH OPENING ONCE MORE AND RISING UP
AGAINST THAT YOUNG MAN
IT ALMOST SEEMED TO HIM THAT UNKNOWN CRATERS
WERE FORMING IN HIS BOSOM
WHAT HE WAS THERE THAT CREATURE WHAT WAS HE THERE FOR HE CAME
CREEPING ABOUT SMELLING OUT EXAMINING TRYING HE CAME SAYING HEY
WHY NOT HE CAME TO PROWL ABOUT HIS JEAN VALJEAN'S LIFE TO PROWL
ABOUT HIS HAPPINESS WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEIZING IT AND BEARING IT AWAY
JEAN VALJEAN ADDED YES THAT'S IT WHAT IS HE IN SEARCH OF AN
ADVENTURE WHAT DOES HE WANT A LOVE AFFAIR A LOVE AFFAIR AND I WHAT
I HAVE BEEN FIRST THE MOST WRETCHED OF MEN AND THEN THE MOST UNHAPPY
AND I HAVE TRAVERSED SIXTY YEARS OF LIFE ON MY KNEES I HAVE SUFFERED
EVERYTHING THAT MAN CAN SUFFER I HAVE GROWN OLD WITHOUT HAVING BEEN
YOUNG I HAVE LIVED WITHOUT A FAMILY WITHOUT RELATIVES WITHOUT
FRIENDS WITHOUT LIFE WITHOUT CHILDREN I HAVE LEFT MY BLOOD ON EVERY
STONE ON EVERY BRAMBLE ON EVERY MILE POST ALONG EVERY WALL I HAVE
BEEN GENTLE THOUGH OTHERS HAVE BEEN HARD TO ME AND KIND ALTHOUGH
OTHERS HAVE BEEN MALICIOUS I HAVE BECOME AN HONEST MAN ONCE MORE IN
SPITE OF EVERYTHING I HAVE REPENTED OF THE EVIL THAT I HAVE DONE AND
HAVE FORGIVEN THE EVIL THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO ME AND AT THE MOMENT
WHEN I RECEIVE MY RECOMPENSE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS ALL OVER AT THE
MOMENT WHEN I AM JUST TOUCHING THE GOAL AT THE MOMENT WHEN I HAVE WHAT
I DESIRE IT IS WELL IT IS GOOD I HAVE PAID I HAVE EARNED IT ALL
THIS IS TO TAKE FLIGHT ALL THIS WILL VANISH AND I SHALL LOSE COSETTE
AND I SHALL LOSE MY LIFE MY JOY MY SOUL BECAUSE IT HAS PLEASED A
GREAT BOOBY TO COME AND LOUNGE AT THE LUXEMBOURG
THEN HIS EYES WERE FILLED WITH A SAD AND EXTRAORDINARY GLEAM
IT WAS NO LONGER A MAN GAZING AT A MAN IT WAS NO LONGER AN ENEMY
SURVEYING AN ENEMY
IT WAS A DOG SCANNING A THIEF
THE READER KNOWS THE REST
MARIUS PURSUED HIS SENSELESS COURSE
ONE DAY
HE FOLLOWED COSETTE TO THE RUE DE L'OUEST
ANOTHER DAY HE SPOKE TO
THE PORTER
THE PORTER ON HIS SIDE SPOKE AND SAID TO JEAN VALJEAN
MONSIEUR WHO IS THAT CURIOUS YOUNG MAN WHO IS ASKING FOR YOU ON THE
MORROW JEAN VALJEAN BESTOWED ON MARIUS THAT GLANCE WHICH MARIUS AT LAST
PERCEIVED
A WEEK LATER JEAN VALJEAN HAD TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE
HE SWORE
TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SET FOOT EITHER IN THE LUXEMBOURG
OR IN THE RUE DE L'OUEST
HE RETURNED TO THE RUE PLUMET
COSETTE DID NOT COMPLAIN SHE SAID NOTHING SHE ASKED NO QUESTIONS SHE
DID NOT SEEK TO LEARN HIS REASONS SHE HAD ALREADY REACHED THE POINT
WHERE SHE WAS AFRAID OF BEING DIVINED AND OF BETRAYING HERSELF
JEAN
VALJEAN HAD NO EXPERIENCE OF THESE MISERIES THE ONLY MISERIES WHICH
ARE CHARMING AND THE ONLY ONES WITH WHICH HE WAS NOT ACQUAINTED THE
CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE GRAVE SIGNIFICANCE OF
COSETTE'S SILENCE
HE MERELY NOTICED THAT SHE HAD GROWN SAD AND HE GREW GLOOMY
ON HIS
SIDE AND ON HERS INEXPERIENCE HAD JOINED ISSUE
ONCE HE MADE A TRIAL
HE ASKED COSETTE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME TO THE LUXEMBOURG
A RAY ILLUMINATED COSETTE'S PALE FACE
YES SAID SHE
THEY WENT THITHER
THREE MONTHS HAD ELAPSED
MARIUS NO LONGER WENT
THERE
MARIUS WAS NOT THERE
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY JEAN VALJEAN ASKED COSETTE AGAIN
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME TO THE LUXEMBOURG
SHE REPLIED SADLY AND GENTLY
NO
JEAN VALJEAN WAS HURT BY THIS SADNESS AND HEART BROKEN AT THIS
GENTLENESS
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THAT MIND WHICH WAS SO YOUNG AND YET ALREADY SO
IMPENETRABLE WHAT WAS ON ITS WAY THERE WITHIN WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE
IN COSETTE'S SOUL SOMETIMES INSTEAD OF GOING TO BED JEAN VALJEAN
REMAINED SEATED ON HIS PALLET WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND HE PASSED
WHOLE NIGHTS ASKING HIMSELF WHAT HAS COSETTE IN HER MIND AND IN
THINKING OF THE THINGS THAT SHE MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT
OH AT SUCH MOMENTS WHAT MOURNFUL GLANCES DID HE CAST TOWARDS THAT
CLOISTER THAT CHASTE PEAK THAT ABODE OF ANGELS THAT INACCESSIBLE
GLACIER OF VIRTUE HOW HE CONTEMPLATED WITH DESPAIRING ECSTASY THAT
CONVENT GARDEN FULL OF IGNORED FLOWERS AND CLOISTERED VIRGINS WHERE
ALL PERFUMES AND ALL SOULS MOUNT STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN HOW HE ADORED THAT
EDEN FOREVER CLOSED AGAINST HIM WHENCE HE HAD VOLUNTARILY AND MADLY
EMERGED HOW HE REGRETTED HIS ABNEGATION AND HIS FOLLY IN HAVING BROUGHT
COSETTE BACK INTO THE WORLD POOR HERO OF SACRIFICE SEIZED AND HURLED
TO THE EARTH BY HIS VERY SELF DEVOTION HOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF WHAT
HAVE I DONE
HOWEVER NOTHING OF ALL THIS WAS PERCEPTIBLE TO COSETTE
NO ILL TEMPER
NO HARSHNESS
HIS FACE WAS ALWAYS SERENE AND KIND
JEAN VALJEAN'S
MANNERS WERE MORE TENDER AND MORE PATERNAL THAN EVER
IF ANYTHING COULD
HAVE BETRAYED HIS LACK OF JOY IT WAS HIS INCREASED SUAVITY
ON HER SIDE COSETTE LANGUISHED
SHE SUFFERED FROM THE ABSENCE OF MARIUS
AS SHE HAD REJOICED IN HIS PRESENCE PECULIARLY WITHOUT EXACTLY BEING
CONSCIOUS OF IT
WHEN JEAN VALJEAN CEASED TO TAKE HER ON THEIR CUSTOMARY
STROLLS A FEMININE INSTINCT MURMURED CONFUSEDLY AT THE BOTTOM OF HER
HEART THAT SHE MUST NOT SEEM TO SET STORE ON THE LUXEMBOURG GARDEN AND
THAT IF THIS PROVED TO BE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO HER HER FATHER
WOULD TAKE HER THITHER ONCE MORE
BUT DAYS WEEKS MONTHS ELAPSED
JEAN
VALJEAN HAD TACITLY ACCEPTED COSETTE'S TACIT CONSENT
SHE REGRETTED IT
IT WAS TOO LATE
SO MARIUS HAD DISAPPEARED ALL WAS OVER
THE DAY ON
WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE LUXEMBOURG MARIUS WAS NO LONGER THERE
WHAT
WAS TO BE DONE SHOULD SHE EVER FIND HIM AGAIN SHE FELT AN ANGUISH AT
HER HEART WHICH NOTHING RELIEVED AND WHICH AUGMENTED EVERY DAY SHE NO
LONGER KNEW WHETHER IT WAS WINTER OR SUMMER WHETHER IT WAS RAINING OR
SHINING WHETHER THE BIRDS WERE SINGING WHETHER IT WAS THE SEASON FOR
DAHLIAS OR DAISIES WHETHER THE LUXEMBOURG WAS MORE CHARMING THAN
THE TUILERIES WHETHER THE LINEN WHICH THE LAUNDRESS BROUGHT HOME
WAS STARCHED TOO MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH WHETHER TOUSSAINT HAD DONE HER
MARKETING WELL OR ILL AND SHE REMAINED DEJECTED ABSORBED ATTENTIVE
TO BUT A SINGLE THOUGHT HER EYES VAGUE AND STARING AS WHEN ONE GAZES BY
NIGHT AT A BLACK AND FATHOMLESS SPOT WHERE AN APPARITION HAS VANISHED
HOWEVER SHE DID NOT ALLOW JEAN VALJEAN TO PERCEIVE ANYTHING OF THIS
EXCEPT HER PALLOR
SHE STILL WORE HER SWEET FACE FOR HIM
THIS PALLOR SUFFICED BUT TOO THOROUGHLY TO TROUBLE JEAN VALJEAN
SOMETIMES HE ASKED HER
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU
SHE REPLIED THERE IS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH ME
AND AFTER A SILENCE WHEN SHE DIVINED THAT HE WAS SAD ALSO SHE WOULD
ADD
AND YOU FATHER IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH YOU
WITH ME NOTHING SAID HE
THESE TWO BEINGS WHO HAD LOVED EACH OTHER SO EXCLUSIVELY AND WITH SO
TOUCHING AN AFFECTION AND WHO HAD LIVED SO LONG FOR EACH OTHER
NOW SUFFERED SIDE BY SIDE EACH ON THE OTHER'S ACCOUNT WITHOUT
ACKNOWLEDGING IT TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT ANGER TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND
WITH A SMILE
CHAPTER VIII THE CHAIN GANG
JEAN VALJEAN WAS THE MORE UNHAPPY OF THE TWO
YOUTH EVEN IN ITS
SORROWS ALWAYS POSSESSES ITS OWN PECULIAR RADIANCE
AT TIMES JEAN VALJEAN SUFFERED SO GREATLY THAT HE BECAME PUERILE
IT IS
THE PROPERTY OF GRIEF TO CAUSE THE CHILDISH SIDE OF MAN TO REAPPEAR
HE
HAD AN UNCONQUERABLE CONVICTION THAT COSETTE WAS ESCAPING FROM HIM
HE
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO RESIST TO RETAIN HER TO AROUSE HER ENTHUSIASM BY
SOME EXTERNAL AND BRILLIANT MATTER
THESE IDEAS PUERILE AS WE HAVE
JUST SAID AND AT THE SAME TIME SENILE CONVEYED TO HIM BY THEIR VERY
CHILDISHNESS A TOLERABLY JUST NOTION OF THE INFLUENCE OF GOLD LACE ON
THE IMAGINATIONS OF YOUNG GIRLS
HE ONCE CHANCED TO SEE A GENERAL ON
HORSEBACK IN FULL UNIFORM PASS ALONG THE STREET COMTE COUTARD THE
COMMANDANT OF PARIS
HE ENVIED THAT GILDED MAN WHAT HAPPINESS IT
WOULD BE HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF HE COULD PUT ON THAT SUIT WHICH WAS AN
INCONTESTABLE THING AND IF COSETTE COULD BEHOLD HIM THUS SHE WOULD BE
DAZZLED AND WHEN HE HAD COSETTE ON HIS ARM AND PASSED THE GATES OF THE
TUILERIES THE GUARD WOULD PRESENT ARMS TO HIM AND THAT WOULD SUFFICE
FOR COSETTE AND WOULD DISPEL HER IDEA OF LOOKING AT YOUNG MEN
AN UNFORESEEN SHOCK WAS ADDED TO THESE SAD REFLECTIONS
IN THE ISOLATED LIFE WHICH THEY LED AND SINCE THEY HAD COME TO DWELL
IN THE RUE PLUMET THEY HAD CONTRACTED ONE HABIT
THEY SOMETIMES TOOK
A PLEASURE TRIP TO SEE THE SUN RISE A MILD SPECIES OF ENJOYMENT WHICH
BEFITS THOSE WHO ARE ENTERING LIFE AND THOSE WHO ARE QUITTING IT
FOR THOSE WHO LOVE SOLITUDE A WALK IN THE EARLY MORNING IS EQUIVALENT
TO A STROLL BY NIGHT WITH THE CHEERFULNESS OF NATURE ADDED
THE STREETS
ARE DESERTED AND THE BIRDS ARE SINGING
COSETTE A BIRD HERSELF LIKED
TO RISE EARLY
THESE MATUTINAL EXCURSIONS WERE PLANNED ON THE PRECEDING
EVENING
HE PROPOSED AND SHE AGREED
IT WAS ARRANGED LIKE A PLOT THEY
SET OUT BEFORE DAYBREAK AND THESE TRIPS WERE SO MANY SMALL DELIGHTS FOR
COSETTE
THESE INNOCENT ECCENTRICITIES PLEASE YOUNG PEOPLE
JEAN VALJEAN'S INCLINATION LED HIM AS WE HAVE SEEN TO THE LEAST
FREQUENTED SPOTS TO SOLITARY NOOKS TO FORGOTTEN PLACES
THERE THEN
EXISTED IN THE VICINITY OF THE BARRIERS OF PARIS A SORT OF POOR
MEADOWS WHICH WERE ALMOST CONFOUNDED WITH THE CITY WHERE GREW IN
SUMMER SICKLY GRAIN AND WHICH IN AUTUMN AFTER THE HARVEST HAD BEEN
GATHERED PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE NOT OF HAVING BEEN REAPED BUT
PEELED
JEAN VALJEAN LOVED TO HAUNT THESE FIELDS
COSETTE WAS NOT BORED
THERE
IT MEANT SOLITUDE TO HIM AND LIBERTY TO HER
THERE SHE BECAME A
LITTLE GIRL ONCE MORE SHE COULD RUN AND ALMOST PLAY SHE TOOK OFF HER
HAT LAID IT ON JEAN VALJEAN'S KNEES AND GATHERED BUNCHES OF FLOWERS
SHE GAZED AT THE BUTTERFLIES ON THE FLOWERS BUT DID NOT CATCH THEM
GENTLENESS AND TENDERNESS ARE BORN WITH LOVE AND THE YOUNG GIRL WHO
CHERISHES WITHIN HER BREAST A TREMBLING AND FRAGILE IDEAL HAS MERCY ON
THE WING OF A BUTTERFLY
SHE WOVE GARLANDS OF POPPIES WHICH SHE PLACED
ON HER HEAD AND WHICH CROSSED AND PENETRATED WITH SUNLIGHT GLOWING
UNTIL THEY FLAMED FORMED FOR HER ROSY FACE A CROWN OF BURNING EMBERS
EVEN AFTER THEIR LIFE HAD GROWN SAD THEY KEPT UP THEIR CUSTOM OF EARLY
STROLLS
ONE MORNING IN OCTOBER THEREFORE TEMPTED BY THE SERENE PERFECTION OF
THE AUTUMN OF 1831 THEY SET OUT AND FOUND THEMSELVES AT BREAK OF
DAY NEAR THE BARRIERE DU MAINE
IT WAS NOT DAWN IT WAS DAYBREAK A
DELIGHTFUL AND STERN MOMENT
A FEW CONSTELLATIONS HERE AND THERE IN THE
DEEP PALE AZURE THE EARTH ALL BLACK THE HEAVENS ALL WHITE A QUIVER
AMID THE BLADES OF GRASS EVERYWHERE THE MYSTERIOUS CHILL OF TWILIGHT
A
LARK WHICH SEEMED MINGLED WITH THE STARS WAS CAROLLING AT A PRODIGIOUS
HEIGHT AND ONE WOULD HAVE DECLARED THAT THAT HYMN OF PETTINESS CALMED
IMMENSITY
IN THE EAST THE VALDE GRACE PROJECTED ITS DARK MASS ON THE
CLEAR HORIZON WITH THE SHARPNESS OF STEEL VENUS DAZZLINGLY BRILLIANT
WAS RISING BEHIND THAT DOME AND HAD THE AIR OF A SOUL MAKING ITS ESCAPE
FROM A GLOOMY EDIFICE
ALL WAS PEACE AND SILENCE THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE ROAD A FEW STRAY
LABORERS OF WHOM THEY CAUGHT BARELY A GLIMPSE WERE ON THEIR WAY TO
THEIR WORK ALONG THE SIDE PATHS
JEAN VALJEAN WAS SITTING IN A CROSS WALK ON SOME PLANKS DEPOSITED AT THE
GATE OF A TIMBER YARD
HIS FACE WAS TURNED TOWARDS THE HIGHWAY HIS BACK
TOWARDS THE LIGHT HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE SUN WHICH WAS ON THE POINT OF
RISING HE HAD SUNK INTO ONE OF THOSE PROFOUND ABSORPTIONS IN WHICH THE
MIND BECOMES CONCENTRATED WHICH IMPRISON EVEN THE EYE AND WHICH ARE
EQUIVALENT TO FOUR WALLS
THERE ARE MEDITATIONS WHICH MAY BE CALLED
VERTICAL WHEN ONE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THEM TIME IS REQUIRED TO RETURN
TO EARTH
JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLUNGED INTO ONE OF THESE REVERIES
HE WAS
THINKING OF COSETTE OF THE HAPPINESS THAT WAS POSSIBLE IF NOTHING CAME
BETWEEN HIM AND HER OF THE LIGHT WITH WHICH SHE FILLED HIS LIFE A
LIGHT WHICH WAS BUT THE EMANATION OF HER SOUL
HE WAS ALMOST HAPPY IN
HIS REVERY
COSETTE WHO WAS STANDING BESIDE HIM WAS GAZING AT THE
CLOUDS AS THEY TURNED ROSY
ALL AT ONCE COSETTE EXCLAIMED FATHER I SHOULD THINK SOME ONE WAS
COMING YONDER JEAN VALJEAN RAISED HIS EYES
COSETTE WAS RIGHT
THE CAUSEWAY WHICH LEADS TO THE ANCIENT BARRIERE DU
MAINE IS A PROLONGATION AS THE READER KNOWS OF THE RUE DE SEVRES
AND IS CUT AT RIGHT ANGLES BY THE INNER BOULEVARD
AT THE ELBOW OF THE
CAUSEWAY AND THE BOULEVARD AT THE SPOT WHERE IT BRANCHES THEY HEARD A
NOISE WHICH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR AT THAT HOUR AND A SORT OF
CONFUSED PILE MADE ITS APPEARANCE
SOME SHAPELESS THING WHICH WAS COMING
FROM THE BOULEVARD WAS TURNING INTO THE ROAD
IT GREW LARGER IT SEEMED TO MOVE IN AN ORDERLY MANNER THOUGH IT WAS
BRISTLING AND QUIVERING IT SEEMED TO BE A VEHICLE BUT ITS LOAD COULD
NOT BE DISTINCTLY MADE OUT
THERE WERE HORSES WHEELS SHOUTS WHIPS
WERE CRACKING
BY DEGREES THE OUTLINES BECAME FIXED ALTHOUGH BATHED
IN SHADOWS
IT WAS A VEHICLE IN FACT WHICH HAD JUST TURNED FROM THE
BOULEVARD INTO THE HIGHWAY AND WHICH WAS DIRECTING ITS COURSE TOWARDS
THE BARRIER NEAR WHICH SAT JEAN VALJEAN A SECOND OF THE SAME ASPECT
FOLLOWED THEN A THIRD THEN A FOURTH SEVEN CHARIOTS MADE THEIR
APPEARANCE IN SUCCESSION THE HEADS OF THE HORSES TOUCHING THE REAR OF
THE WAGON IN FRONT
FIGURES WERE MOVING ON THESE VEHICLES FLASHES WERE
VISIBLE THROUGH THE DUSK AS THOUGH THERE WERE NAKED SWORDS THERE A
CLANKING BECAME AUDIBLE WHICH RESEMBLED THE RATTLING OF CHAINS AND AS
THIS SOMETHING ADVANCED THE SOUND OF VOICES WAXED LOUDER AND IT TURNED
INTO A TERRIBLE THING SUCH AS EMERGES FROM THE CAVE OF DREAMS
AS IT DREW NEARER IT ASSUMED A FORM AND WAS OUTLINED BEHIND THE TREES
WITH THE PALLID HUE OF AN APPARITION THE MASS GREW WHITE THE DAY
WHICH WAS SLOWLY DAWNING CAST A WAN LIGHT ON THIS SWARMING HEAP WHICH
WAS AT ONCE BOTH SEPULCHRAL AND LIVING THE HEADS OF THE FIGURES TURNED
INTO THE FACES OF CORPSES AND THIS IS WHAT IT PROVED TO BE
SEVEN WAGONS WERE DRIVING IN A FILE ALONG THE ROAD
THE FIRST SIX WERE
SINGULARLY CONSTRUCTED
THEY RESEMBLED COOPERS' DRAYS THEY CONSISTED
OF LONG LADDERS PLACED ON TWO WHEELS AND FORMING BARROWS AT THEIR REAR
EXTREMITIES
EACH DRAY OR RATHER LET US SAY EACH LADDER WAS ATTACHED
TO FOUR HORSES HARNESSED TANDEM
ON THESE LADDERS STRANGE CLUSTERS OF
MEN WERE BEING DRAWN
IN THE FAINT LIGHT THESE MEN WERE TO BE DIVINED
RATHER THAN SEEN
TWENTY FOUR ON EACH VEHICLE TWELVE ON A SIDE BACK TO
BACK FACING THE PASSERS BY THEIR LEGS DANGLING IN THE AIR THIS WAS
THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE MEN WERE TRAVELLING AND BEHIND THEIR BACKS
THEY HAD SOMETHING WHICH CLANKED AND WHICH WAS A CHAIN AND ON THEIR
NECKS SOMETHING WHICH SHONE AND WHICH WAS AN IRON COLLAR
EACH MAN HAD
HIS COLLAR BUT THE CHAIN WAS FOR ALL SO THAT IF THESE FOUR AND TWENTY
MEN HAD OCCASION TO ALIGHT FROM THE DRAY AND WALK THEY WERE SEIZED WITH
A SORT OF INEXORABLE UNITY AND WERE OBLIGED TO WIND OVER THE GROUND
WITH THE CHAIN FOR A BACKBONE SOMEWHAT AFTER THE FASHION OF MILLEPEDS
IN THE BACK AND FRONT OF EACH VEHICLE TWO MEN ARMED WITH MUSKETS
STOOD ERECT EACH HOLDING ONE END OF THE CHAIN UNDER HIS FOOT
THE IRON
NECKLETS WERE SQUARE
THE SEVENTH VEHICLE A HUGE RACK SIDED BAGGAGE
WAGON WITHOUT A HOOD HAD FOUR WHEELS AND SIX HORSES AND CARRIED A
SONOROUS PILE OF IRON BOILERS CAST IRON POTS BRAZIERS AND CHAINS
AMONG WHICH WERE MINGLED SEVERAL MEN WHO WERE PINIONED AND STRETCHED AT
FULL LENGTH AND WHO SEEMED TO BE ILL
THIS WAGON ALL LATTICE WORK
WAS GARNISHED WITH DILAPIDATED HURDLES WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE SERVED FOR
FORMER PUNISHMENTS
THESE VEHICLES KEPT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
ON
EACH SIDE MARCHED A DOUBLE HEDGE OF GUARDS OF INFAMOUS ASPECT WEARING
THREE CORNERED HATS LIKE THE SOLDIERS UNDER THE DIRECTORY SHABBY
COVERED WITH SPOTS AND HOLES MUFFLED IN UNIFORMS OF VETERANS AND THE
TROUSERS OF UNDERTAKERS' MEN HALF GRAY HALF BLUE WHICH WERE ALMOST
HANGING IN RAGS WITH RED EPAULETS YELLOW SHOULDER BELTS SHORT SABRES
MUSKETS AND CUDGELS THEY WERE A SPECIES OF SOLDIER BLACKGUARDS
THESE MYRMIDONS SEEMED COMPOSED OF THE ABJECTNESS OF THE BEGGAR AND THE
AUTHORITY OF THE EXECUTIONER
THE ONE WHO APPEARED TO BE THEIR CHIEF
HELD A POSTILION'S WHIP IN HIS HAND
ALL THESE DETAILS BLURRED BY THE
DIMNESS OF DAWN BECAME MORE AND MORE CLEARLY OUTLINED AS THE LIGHT
INCREASED
AT THE HEAD AND IN THE REAR OF THE CONVOY RODE MOUNTED
GENDARMES SERIOUS AND WITH SWORD IN FIST
THIS PROCESSION WAS SO LONG THAT WHEN THE FIRST VEHICLE REACHED THE
BARRIER THE LAST WAS BARELY DEBAUCHING FROM THE BOULEVARD
A THRONG
SPRUNG IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHENCE AND FORMED IN A TWINKLING AS
IS FREQUENTLY THE CASE IN PARIS PRESSED FORWARD FROM BOTH SIDES OF
THE ROAD AND LOOKED ON
IN THE NEIGHBORING LANES THE SHOUTS OF PEOPLE
CALLING TO EACH OTHER AND THE WOODEN SHOES OF MARKET GARDENERS HASTENING
UP TO GAZE WERE AUDIBLE
THE MEN MASSED UPON THE DRAYS ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE JOLTED ALONG IN
SILENCE
THEY WERE LIVID WITH THE CHILL OF MORNING
THEY ALL WORE LINEN
TROUSERS AND THEIR BARE FEET WERE THRUST INTO WOODEN SHOES
THE REST
OF THEIR COSTUME WAS A FANTASY OF WRETCHEDNESS
THEIR ACCOUTREMENTS WERE
HORRIBLY INCONGRUOUS NOTHING IS MORE FUNEREAL THAN THE HARLEQUIN IN
RAGS
BATTERED FELT HATS TARPAULIN CAPS HIDEOUS WOOLLEN NIGHTCAPS
AND SIDE BY SIDE WITH A SHORT BLOUSE A BLACK COAT BROKEN AT THE ELBOW
MANY WORE WOMEN'S HEADGEAR OTHERS HAD BASKETS ON THEIR HEADS HAIRY
BREASTS WERE VISIBLE AND THROUGH THE RENT IN THEIR GARMENTS TATTOOED
DESIGNS COULD BE DESCRIED TEMPLES OF LOVE FLAMING HEARTS CUPIDS
ERUPTIONS AND UNHEALTHY RED BLOTCHES COULD ALSO BE SEEN
TWO OR THREE
HAD A STRAW ROPE ATTACHED TO THE CROSS BAR OF THE DRAY AND SUSPENDED
UNDER THEM LIKE A STIRRUP WHICH SUPPORTED THEIR FEET
ONE OF THEM HELD
IN HIS HAND AND RAISED TO HIS MOUTH SOMETHING WHICH HAD THE APPEARANCE
OF A BLACK STONE AND WHICH HE SEEMED TO BE GNAWING IT WAS BREAD WHICH
HE WAS EATING
THERE WERE NO EYES THERE WHICH WERE NOT EITHER DRY
DULLED OR FLAMING WITH AN EVIL LIGHT
THE ESCORT TROOP CURSED THE MEN
IN CHAINS DID NOT UTTER A SYLLABLE FROM TIME TO TIME THE SOUND OF
A BLOW BECAME AUDIBLE AS THE CUDGELS DESCENDED ON SHOULDER BLADES OR
SKULLS SOME OF THESE MEN WERE YAWNING THEIR RAGS WERE TERRIBLE
THEIR FEET HUNG DOWN THEIR SHOULDERS OSCILLATED THEIR HEADS CLASHED
TOGETHER THEIR FETTERS CLANKED THEIR EYES GLARED FEROCIOUSLY THEIR
FISTS CLENCHED OR FELL OPEN INERTLY LIKE THE HANDS OF CORPSES IN THE
REAR OF THE CONVOY RAN A BAND OF CHILDREN SCREAMING WITH LAUGHTER
THIS FILE OF VEHICLES WHATEVER ITS NATURE WAS WAS MOURNFUL
IT
WAS EVIDENT THAT TO MORROW THAT AN HOUR HENCE A POURING RAIN MIGHT
DESCEND THAT IT MIGHT BE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND THAT
THEIR DILAPIDATED GARMENTS WOULD BE DRENCHED THAT ONCE SOAKED THESE
MEN WOULD NOT GET DRY AGAIN THAT ONCE CHILLED THEY WOULD NOT AGAIN
GET WARM THAT THEIR LINEN TROUSERS WOULD BE GLUED TO THEIR BONES BY THE
DOWNPOUR THAT THE WATER WOULD FILL THEIR SHOES THAT NO LASHES FROM
THE WHIPS WOULD BE ABLE TO PREVENT THEIR JAWS FROM CHATTERING THAT THE
CHAIN WOULD CONTINUE TO BIND THEM BY THE NECK THAT THEIR LEGS WOULD
CONTINUE TO DANGLE AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SHUDDER AT THE SIGHT
OF THESE HUMAN BEINGS THUS BOUND AND PASSIVE BENEATH THE COLD CLOUDS OF
AUTUMN AND DELIVERED OVER TO THE RAIN TO THE BLAST TO ALL THE FURIES
OF THE AIR LIKE TREES AND STONES
BLOWS FROM THE CUDGEL WERE NOT OMITTED EVEN IN THE CASE OF THE SICK MEN
WHO LAY THERE KNOTTED WITH ROPES AND MOTIONLESS ON THE SEVENTH WAGON
AND WHO APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN TOSSED THERE LIKE SACKS FILLED WITH
MISERY
SUDDENLY THE SUN MADE ITS APPEARANCE THE IMMENSE LIGHT OF THE ORIENT
BURST FORTH AND ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT HAD SET FIRE TO ALL THOSE
FEROCIOUS HEADS
THEIR TONGUES WERE UNLOOSED A CONFLAGRATION OF GRINS
OATHS AND SONGS EXPLODED
THE BROAD HORIZONTAL SHEET OF LIGHT SEVERED
THE FILE IN TWO PARTS ILLUMINATING HEADS AND BODIES LEAVING FEET AND
WHEELS IN THE OBSCURITY
THOUGHTS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE ON THESE FACES
IT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT VISIBLE DEMONS WITH THEIR MASKS REMOVED
FIERCE SOULS LAID BARE
THOUGH LIGHTED UP THIS WILD THRONG REMAINED IN
GLOOM
SOME WHO WERE GAY HAD IN THEIR MOUTHS QUILLS THROUGH WHICH THEY
BLEW VERMIN OVER THE CROWD PICKING OUT THE WOMEN THE DAWN ACCENTUATED
THESE LAMENTABLE PROFILES WITH THE BLACKNESS OF ITS SHADOWS THERE
WAS NOT ONE OF THESE CREATURES WHO WAS NOT DEFORMED BY REASON OF
WRETCHEDNESS AND THE WHOLE WAS SO MONSTROUS THAT ONE WOULD HAVE
SAID THAT THE SUN'S BRILLIANCY HAD BEEN CHANGED INTO THE GLARE OF THE
LIGHTNING
THE WAGON LOAD WHICH HEADED THE LINE HAD STRUCK UP A SONG
AND WERE SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES WITH A HAGGARD JOVIALITY
A POTPOURRI BY DESAUGIERS THEN FAMOUS CALLED THE VESTAL THE TREES
SHIVERED MOURNFULLY IN THE CROSS LANES COUNTENANCES OF BOURGEOIS
LISTENED IN AN IDIOTIC DELIGHT TO THESE COARSE STRAINS DRONED BY
SPECTRES
ALL SORTS OF DISTRESS MET IN THIS PROCESSION AS IN CHAOS HERE WERE TO
BE FOUND THE FACIAL ANGLES OF EVERY SORT OF BEAST OLD MEN YOUTHS
BALD HEADS GRAY BEARDS CYNICAL MONSTROSITIES SOUR RESIGNATION SAVAGE
GRINS SENSELESS ATTITUDES SNOUTS SURMOUNTED BY CAPS HEADS LIKE THOSE
OF YOUNG GIRLS WITH CORKSCREW CURLS ON THE TEMPLES INFANTILE VISAGES
AND BY REASON OF THAT HORRIBLE THIN SKELETON FACES TO WHICH DEATH
ALONE WAS LACKING
ON THE FIRST CART WAS A NEGRO WHO HAD BEEN A SLAVE
IN ALL PROBABILITY AND WHO COULD MAKE A COMPARISON OF HIS CHAINS
THE
FRIGHTFUL LEVELLER FROM BELOW SHAME HAD PASSED OVER THESE BROWS AT
THAT DEGREE OF ABASEMENT THE LAST TRANSFORMATIONS WERE SUFFERED BY ALL
IN THEIR EXTREMEST DEPTHS AND IGNORANCE CONVERTED INTO DULNESS WAS
THE EQUAL OF INTELLIGENCE CONVERTED INTO DESPAIR
THERE WAS NO CHOICE
POSSIBLE BETWEEN THESE MEN WHO APPEARED TO THE EYE AS THE FLOWER OF THE
MUD
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD HAD THE ORDERING OF THAT
UNCLEAN PROCESSION HAD NOT CLASSIFIED THEM
THESE BEINGS HAD BEEN
FETTERED AND COUPLED PELL MELL IN ALPHABETICAL DISORDER PROBABLY AND
LOADED HAP HAZARD ON THOSE CARTS
NEVERTHELESS HORRORS WHEN GROUPED
TOGETHER ALWAYS END BY EVOLVING A RESULT ALL ADDITIONS OF WRETCHED MEN
GIVE A SUM TOTAL EACH CHAIN EXHALED A COMMON SOUL AND EACH DRAY LOAD
HAD ITS OWN PHYSIOGNOMY
BY THE SIDE OF THE ONE WHERE THEY WERE SINGING
THERE WAS ONE WHERE THEY WERE HOWLING A THIRD WHERE THEY WERE BEGGING
ONE COULD BE SEEN IN WHICH THEY WERE GNASHING THEIR TEETH ANOTHER LOAD
MENACED THE SPECTATORS ANOTHER BLASPHEMED GOD THE LAST WAS AS SILENT
AS THE TOMB
DANTE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE BEHELD HIS SEVEN CIRCLES
OF HELL ON THE MARCH
THE MARCH OF THE DAMNED TO THEIR TORTURES
PERFORMED IN SINISTER WISE NOT ON THE FORMIDABLE AND FLAMING CHARIOT
OF THE APOCALYPSE BUT WHAT WAS MORE MOURNFUL THAN THAT ON THE GIBBET
CART
ONE OF THE GUARDS WHO HAD A HOOK ON THE END OF HIS CUDGEL MADE A
PRETENCE FROM TIME TO TIME OF STIRRING UP THIS MASS OF HUMAN FILTH
AN OLD WOMAN IN THE CROWD POINTED THEM OUT TO HER LITTLE BOY FIVE YEARS
OLD AND SAID TO HIM RASCAL LET THAT BE A WARNING TO YOU
AS THE SONGS AND BLASPHEMIES INCREASED THE MAN WHO APPEARED TO BE THE
CAPTAIN OF THE ESCORT CRACKED HIS WHIP AND AT THAT SIGNAL A FEARFUL
DULL AND BLIND FLOGGING WHICH PRODUCED THE SOUND OF HAIL FELL UPON THE
SEVEN DRAY LOADS MANY ROARED AND FOAMED AT THE MOUTH WHICH REDOUBLED
THE DELIGHT OF THE STREET URCHINS WHO HAD HASTENED UP A SWARM OF FLIES
ON THESE WOUNDS
JEAN VALJEAN'S EYES HAD ASSUMED A FRIGHTFUL EXPRESSION
THEY WERE NO
LONGER EYES THEY WERE THOSE DEEP AND GLASSY OBJECTS WHICH REPLACE THE
GLANCE IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN WRETCHED MEN WHICH SEEM UNCONSCIOUS
OF REALITY AND IN WHICH FLAMES THE REFLECTION OF TERRORS AND OF
CATASTROPHES
HE WAS NOT LOOKING AT A SPECTACLE HE WAS SEEING A VISION
HE TRIED TO RISE TO FLEE TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE HE COULD NOT MOVE HIS
FEET
SOMETIMES THE THINGS THAT YOU SEE SEIZE UPON YOU AND HOLD YOU
FAST
HE REMAINED NAILED TO THE SPOT PETRIFIED STUPID ASKING HIMSELF
ATHWART CONFUSED AND INEXPRESSIBLE ANGUISH WHAT THIS SEPULCHRAL
PERSECUTION SIGNIFIED AND WHENCE HAD COME THAT PANDEMONIUM WHICH WAS
PURSUING HIM
ALL AT ONCE HE RAISED HIS HAND TO HIS BROW A GESTURE
HABITUAL TO THOSE WHOSE MEMORY SUDDENLY RETURNS HE REMEMBERED THAT THIS
WAS IN FACT THE USUAL ITINERARY THAT IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO MAKE THIS
DETOUR IN ORDER TO AVOID ALL POSSIBILITY OF ENCOUNTERING ROYALTY ON THE
ROAD TO FONTAINEBLEAU AND THAT FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS BEFORE HE HAD
HIMSELF PASSED THROUGH THAT BARRIER
COSETTE WAS NO LESS TERRIFIED BUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY
SHE DID NOT
UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE BEHELD DID NOT SEEM TO HER TO BE POSSIBLE AT
LENGTH SHE CRIED
FATHER WHAT ARE THOSE MEN IN THOSE CARTS
JEAN VALJEAN REPLIED CONVICTS
WHITHER ARE THEY GOING
TO THE GALLEYS
AT THAT MOMENT THE CUDGELLING MULTIPLIED BY A HUNDRED HANDS BECAME
ZEALOUS BLOWS WITH THE FLAT OF THE SWORD WERE MINGLED WITH IT IT WAS A
PERFECT STORM OF WHIPS AND CLUBS THE CONVICTS BENT BEFORE IT A HIDEOUS
OBEDIENCE WAS EVOKED BY THE TORTURE AND ALL HELD THEIR PEACE DARTING
GLANCES LIKE CHAINED WOLVES
COSETTE TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB SHE RESUMED
FATHER ARE THEY STILL MEN
SOMETIMES ANSWERED THE UNHAPPY MAN
IT WAS THE CHAIN GANG IN FACT WHICH HAD SET OUT BEFORE DAYBREAK FROM
BICETRE AND HAD TAKEN THE ROAD TO MANS IN ORDER TO AVOID FONTAINEBLEAU
WHERE THE KING THEN WAS
THIS CAUSED THE HORRIBLE JOURNEY TO LAST THREE
OR FOUR DAYS LONGER BUT TORTURE MAY SURELY BE PROLONGED WITH THE OBJECT
OF SPARING THE ROYAL PERSONAGE A SIGHT OF IT
JEAN VALJEAN RETURNED HOME UTTERLY OVERWHELMED
SUCH ENCOUNTERS ARE
SHOCKS AND THE MEMORY THAT THEY LEAVE BEHIND THEM RESEMBLES A THOROUGH
SHAKING UP
NEVERTHELESS JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT OBSERVE THAT ON HIS WAY BACK TO
THE RUE DE BABYLONE WITH COSETTE THE LATTER WAS PLYING HIM WITH OTHER
QUESTIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF WHAT THEY HAD JUST SEEN PERHAPS HE WAS
TOO MUCH ABSORBED IN HIS OWN DEJECTION TO NOTICE HER WORDS AND REPLY TO
THEM
BUT WHEN COSETTE WAS LEAVING HIM IN THE EVENING TO BETAKE HERSELF
TO BED HE HEARD HER SAY IN A LOW VOICE AND AS THOUGH TALKING TO
HERSELF IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF I WERE TO FIND ONE OF THOSE MEN IN MY
PATHWAY OH MY GOD I SHOULD DIE MERELY FROM THE SIGHT OF HIM CLOSE AT
HAND
FORTUNATELY CHANCE ORDAINED THAT ON THE MORROW OF THAT TRAGIC DAY
THERE WAS SOME OFFICIAL SOLEMNITY APROPOS OF I KNOW NOT WHAT FETES IN
PARIS A REVIEW IN THE CHAMP DE MARS JOUSTS ON THE SEINE THEATRICAL
PERFORMANCES IN THE CHAMPS ELYSEES FIREWORKS AT THE ARC DE L'ETOILE
ILLUMINATIONS EVERYWHERE
JEAN VALJEAN DID VIOLENCE TO HIS HABITS AND
TOOK COSETTE TO SEE THESE REJOICINGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIVERTING HER
FROM THE MEMORY OF THE DAY BEFORE AND OF EFFACING BENEATH THE SMILING
TUMULT OF ALL PARIS THE ABOMINABLE THING WHICH HAD PASSED BEFORE HER
THE REVIEW WITH WHICH THE FESTIVAL WAS SPICED MADE THE PRESENCE OF
UNIFORMS PERFECTLY NATURAL JEAN VALJEAN DONNED HIS UNIFORM OF A
NATIONAL GUARD WITH THE VAGUE INWARD FEELING OF A MAN WHO IS BETAKING
HIMSELF TO SHELTER
HOWEVER THIS TRIP SEEMED TO ATTAIN ITS OBJECT
COSETTE WHO MADE IT HER LAW TO PLEASE HER FATHER AND TO WHOM
MOREOVER ALL SPECTACLES WERE A NOVELTY ACCEPTED THIS DIVERSION
WITH THE LIGHT AND EASY GOOD GRACE OF YOUTH AND DID NOT POUT TOO
DISDAINFULLY AT THAT FLUTTER OF ENJOYMENT CALLED A PUBLIC FETE SO THAT
JEAN VALJEAN WAS ABLE TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SUCCEEDED AND THAT NO
TRACE OF THAT HIDEOUS VISION REMAINED
SOME DAYS LATER ONE MORNING WHEN THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND
THEY WERE BOTH ON THE STEPS LEADING TO THE GARDEN ANOTHER INFRACTION OF
THE RULES WHICH JEAN VALJEAN SEEMED TO HAVE IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF AND
TO THE CUSTOM OF REMAINING IN HER CHAMBER WHICH MELANCHOLY HAD CAUSED
COSETTE TO ADOPT COSETTE IN A WRAPPER WAS STANDING ERECT IN THAT
NEGLIGENT ATTIRE OF EARLY MORNING WHICH ENVELOPS YOUNG GIRLS IN AN
ADORABLE WAY AND WHICH PRODUCES THE EFFECT OF A CLOUD DRAWN OVER A STAR
AND WITH HER HEAD BATHED IN LIGHT ROSY AFTER A GOOD SLEEP SUBMITTING
TO THE GENTLE GLANCES OF THE TENDER OLD MAN SHE WAS PICKING A DAISY
TO PIECES
COSETTE DID NOT KNOW THE DELIGHTFUL LEGEND I LOVE A LITTLE
PASSIONATELY ETC WHO WAS THERE WHO COULD HAVE TAUGHT HER SHE WAS
HANDLING THE FLOWER INSTINCTIVELY INNOCENTLY WITHOUT A SUSPICION THAT
TO PLUCK A DAISY APART IS TO DO THE SAME BY A HEART
IF THERE WERE A
FOURTH AND SMILING GRACE CALLED MELANCHOLY SHE WOULD HAVE WORN THE AIR
OF THAT GRACE
JEAN VALJEAN WAS FASCINATED BY THE CONTEMPLATION OF THOSE
TINY FINGERS ON THAT FLOWER AND FORGETFUL OF EVERYTHING IN THE RADIANCE
EMITTED BY THAT CHILD
A RED BREAST WAS WARBLING IN THE THICKET ON ONE
SIDE
WHITE CLOUDLETS FLOATED ACROSS THE SKY SO GAYLY THAT ONE WOULD
HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAD JUST BEEN SET AT LIBERTY
COSETTE WENT ON
ATTENTIVELY TEARING THE LEAVES FROM HER FLOWER SHE SEEMED TO BE
THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING BUT WHATEVER IT WAS IT MUST BE SOMETHING
CHARMING ALL AT ONCE SHE TURNED HER HEAD OVER HER SHOULDER WITH THE
DELICATE LANGUOR OF A SWAN AND SAID TO JEAN VALJEAN FATHER WHAT ARE
THE GALLEYS LIKE
BOOK FOURTH SUCCOR FROM BELOW MAY TURN OUT TO BE SUCCOR FROM ON HIGH
CHAPTER I A WOUND WITHOUT HEALING WITHIN
THUS THEIR LIFE CLOUDED OVER BY DEGREES
BUT ONE DIVERSION WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN A HAPPINESS REMAINED TO
THEM WHICH WAS TO CARRY BREAD TO THOSE WHO WERE HUNGRY AND CLOTHING
TO THOSE WHO WERE COLD
COSETTE OFTEN ACCOMPANIED JEAN VALJEAN ON THESE
VISITS TO THE POOR ON WHICH THEY RECOVERED SOME REMNANTS OF THEIR
FORMER FREE INTERCOURSE AND SOMETIMES WHEN THE DAY HAD BEEN A GOOD
ONE AND THEY HAD ASSISTED MANY IN DISTRESS AND CHEERED AND WARMED MANY
LITTLE CHILDREN COSETTE WAS RATHER MERRY IN THE EVENING
IT WAS AT THIS
EPOCH THAT THEY PAID THEIR VISIT TO THE JONDRETTE DEN
ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THAT VISIT JEAN VALJEAN MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE
PAVILION IN THE MORNING CALM AS WAS HIS WONT BUT WITH A LARGE WOUND ON
HIS LEFT ARM WHICH WAS MUCH INFLAMED AND VERY ANGRY WHICH RESEMBLED A
BURN AND WHICH HE EXPLAINED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
THIS WOUND RESULTED
IN HIS BEING DETAINED IN THE HOUSE FOR A MONTH WITH FEVER
HE WOULD NOT
CALL IN A DOCTOR
WHEN COSETTE URGED HIM CALL THE DOG DOCTOR SAID
HE
COSETTE DRESSED THE WOUND MORNING AND EVENING WITH SO DIVINE AN AIR AND
SUCH ANGELIC HAPPINESS AT BEING OF USE TO HIM THAT JEAN VALJEAN FELT
ALL HIS FORMER JOY RETURNING HIS FEARS AND ANXIETIES DISSIPATING AND
HE GAZED AT COSETTE SAYING OH WHAT A KINDLY WOUND OH WHAT A GOOD
MISFORTUNE
COSETTE ON PERCEIVING THAT HER FATHER WAS ILL HAD DESERTED THE PAVILION
AND AGAIN TAKEN A FANCY TO THE LITTLE LODGING AND THE BACK COURTYARD
SHE PASSED NEARLY ALL HER DAYS BESIDE JEAN VALJEAN AND READ TO HIM
THE BOOKS WHICH HE DESIRED
GENERALLY THEY WERE BOOKS OF TRAVEL
JEAN
VALJEAN WAS UNDERGOING A NEW BIRTH HIS HAPPINESS WAS REVIVING IN THESE
INEFFABLE RAYS THE LUXEMBOURG THE PROWLING YOUNG STRANGER COSETTE'S
COLDNESS ALL THESE CLOUDS UPON HIS SOUL WERE GROWING DIM
HE HAD
REACHED THE POINT WHERE HE SAID TO HIMSELF I IMAGINED ALL THAT
I AM
AN OLD FOOL
HIS HAPPINESS WAS SO GREAT THAT THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY OF THE
THENARDIERS MADE IN THE JONDRETTE HOVEL UNEXPECTED AS IT WAS HAD
AFTER A FASHION GLIDED OVER HIM UNNOTICED
HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING
HIS ESCAPE ALL TRACE OF HIM WAS LOST WHAT MORE DID HE CARE FOR HE
ONLY THOUGHT OF THOSE WRETCHED BEINGS TO PITY THEM
HERE THEY ARE IN
PRISON AND HENCEFORTH THEY WILL BE INCAPACITATED FOR DOING ANY HARM
HE THOUGHT BUT WHAT A LAMENTABLE FAMILY IN DISTRESS
AS FOR THE HIDEOUS VISION OF THE BARRIERE DU MAINE COSETTE HAD NOT
REFERRED TO IT AGAIN
SISTER SAINTE MECHTILDE HAD TAUGHT COSETTE MUSIC IN THE CONVENT COSETTE
HAD THE VOICE OF A LINNET WITH A SOUL AND SOMETIMES IN THE EVENING
IN THE WOUNDED MAN'S HUMBLE ABODE SHE WARBLED MELANCHOLY SONGS WHICH
DELIGHTED JEAN VALJEAN
SPRING CAME THE GARDEN WAS SO DELIGHTFUL AT THAT SEASON OF THE YEAR
THAT JEAN VALJEAN SAID TO COSETTE
YOU NEVER GO THERE I WANT YOU TO STROLL IN IT
AS YOU LIKE FATHER SAID COSETTE
AND FOR THE SAKE OF OBEYING HER FATHER SHE RESUMED HER WALKS IN THE
GARDEN GENERALLY ALONE FOR AS WE HAVE MENTIONED JEAN VALJEAN WHO
WAS PROBABLY AFRAID OF BEING SEEN THROUGH THE FENCE HARDLY EVER WENT
THERE
JEAN VALJEAN'S WOUND HAD CREATED A DIVERSION
WHEN COSETTE SAW THAT HER FATHER WAS SUFFERING LESS THAT HE WAS
CONVALESCING AND THAT HE APPEARED TO BE HAPPY SHE EXPERIENCED A
CONTENTMENT WHICH SHE DID NOT EVEN PERCEIVE SO GENTLY AND NATURALLY
HAD IT COME
THEN IT WAS IN THE MONTH OF MARCH THE DAYS WERE GROWING
LONGER THE WINTER WAS DEPARTING THE WINTER ALWAYS BEARS AWAY WITH IT A
PORTION OF OUR SADNESS THEN CAME APRIL THAT DAYBREAK OF SUMMER FRESH
AS DAWN ALWAYS IS GAY LIKE EVERY CHILDHOOD A LITTLE INCLINED TO WEEP
AT TIMES LIKE THE NEW BORN BEING THAT IT IS
IN THAT MONTH NATURE
HAS CHARMING GLEAMS WHICH PASS FROM THE SKY FROM THE TREES FROM THE
MEADOWS AND THE FLOWERS INTO THE HEART OF MAN
COSETTE WAS STILL TOO YOUNG TO ESCAPE THE PENETRATING INFLUENCE OF THAT
APRIL JOY WHICH BORE SO STRONG A RESEMBLANCE TO HERSELF
INSENSIBLY AND
WITHOUT HER SUSPECTING THE FACT THE BLACKNESS DEPARTED FROM HER SPIRIT
IN SPRING SAD SOULS GROW LIGHT AS LIGHT FALLS INTO CELLARS AT MIDDAY
COSETTE WAS NO LONGER SAD
HOWEVER THOUGH THIS WAS SO SHE DID NOT
ACCOUNT FOR IT TO HERSELF
IN THE MORNING ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AFTER
BREAKFAST WHEN SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN ENTICING HER FATHER INTO THE GARDEN
FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND WHEN SHE WAS PACING UP AND DOWN IN THE
SUNLIGHT IN FRONT OF THE STEPS SUPPORTING HIS LEFT ARM FOR HIM SHE DID
NOT PERCEIVE THAT SHE LAUGHED EVERY MOMENT AND THAT SHE WAS HAPPY
JEAN VALJEAN INTOXICATED BEHELD HER GROWING FRESH AND ROSY ONCE MORE
OH WHAT A GOOD WOUND HE REPEATED IN A WHISPER
AND HE FELT GRATEFUL TO THE THENARDIERS
HIS WOUND ONCE HEALED HE RESUMED HIS SOLITARY TWILIGHT STROLLS
IT IS A MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THAT A PERSON CAN STROLL ALONE IN THAT
FASHION IN THE UNINHABITED REGIONS OF PARIS WITHOUT MEETING WITH SOME
ADVENTURE
CHAPTER II MOTHER PLUTARQUE FINDS NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING A
PHENOMENON
ONE EVENING LITTLE GAVROCHE HAD HAD NOTHING TO EAT HE REMEMBERED
THAT HE HAD NOT DINED ON THE PRECEDING DAY EITHER THIS WAS BECOMING
TIRESOME
HE RESOLVED TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO SECURE SOME SUPPER
HE
STROLLED OUT BEYOND THE SALPETRIERE INTO DESERTED REGIONS THAT IS
WHERE WINDFALLS ARE TO BE FOUND WHERE THERE IS NO ONE ONE ALWAYS
FINDS SOMETHING
HE REACHED A SETTLEMENT WHICH APPEARED TO HIM TO BE THE
VILLAGE OF AUSTERLITZ
IN ONE OF HIS PRECEDING LOUNGES HE HAD NOTICED THERE AN OLD GARDEN
HAUNTED BY AN OLD MAN AND AN OLD WOMAN AND IN THAT GARDEN A PASSABLE
APPLE TREE
BESIDE THE APPLE TREE STOOD A SORT OF FRUIT HOUSE WHICH WAS
NOT SECURELY FASTENED AND WHERE ONE MIGHT CONTRIVE TO GET AN APPLE
ONE
APPLE IS A SUPPER ONE APPLE IS LIFE
THAT WHICH WAS ADAM'S RUIN MIGHT
PROVE GAVROCHE'S SALVATION
THE GARDEN ABUTTED ON A SOLITARY UNPAVED
LANE BORDERED WITH BRUSHWOOD WHILE AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF HOUSES THE
GARDEN WAS SEPARATED FROM IT BY A HEDGE
GAVROCHE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THIS GARDEN HE FOUND THE LANE HE
RECOGNIZED THE APPLE TREE HE VERIFIED THE FRUIT HOUSE HE EXAMINED THE
HEDGE A HEDGE MEANS MERELY ONE STRIDE
THE DAY WAS DECLINING THERE WAS
NOT EVEN A CAT IN THE LANE THE HOUR WAS PROPITIOUS
GAVROCHE BEGAN
THE OPERATION OF SCALING THE HEDGE THEN SUDDENLY PAUSED
SOME ONE WAS
TALKING IN THE GARDEN
GAVROCHE PEEPED THROUGH ONE OF THE BREAKS IN THE
HEDGE
ILLUSTRATION SUCCOR FROM BELOW 4B4 1 SUCCOR FROM BELOW
A COUPLE OF PACES DISTANT AT THE FOOT OF THE HEDGE ON THE OTHER SIDE
EXACTLY AT THE POINT WHERE THE GAP WHICH HE WAS MEDITATING WOULD HAVE
BEEN MADE THERE WAS A SORT OF RECUMBENT STONE WHICH FORMED A BENCH AND
ON THIS BENCH WAS SEATED THE OLD MAN OF THE GARDEN WHILE THE OLD WOMAN
WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM
THE OLD WOMAN WAS GRUMBLING
GAVROCHE WHO
WAS NOT VERY DISCREET LISTENED
MONSIEUR MABEUF SAID THE OLD WOMAN
MABEUF THOUGHT GAVROCHE THAT NAME IS A PERFECT FARCE
THE OLD MAN WHO WAS THUS ADDRESSED DID NOT STIR
THE OLD WOMAN
REPEATED
MONSIEUR MABEUF
THE OLD MAN WITHOUT RAISING HIS EYES FROM THE GROUND MADE UP HIS MIND
TO ANSWER
WHAT IS IT MOTHER PLUTARQUE
MOTHER PLUTARQUE THOUGHT GAVROCHE ANOTHER FARCICAL NAME
MOTHER PLUTARQUE BEGAN AGAIN AND THE OLD MAN WAS FORCED TO ACCEPT THE
CONVERSATION
THE LANDLORD IS NOT PLEASED
WHY
WE OWE THREE QUARTERS RENT
IN THREE MONTHS WE SHALL OWE HIM FOR FOUR QUARTERS
HE SAYS THAT HE WILL TURN YOU OUT TO SLEEP
I WILL GO
THE GREEN GROCER INSISTS ON BEING PAID
SHE WILL NO LONGER LEAVE HER
FAGOTS
WHAT WILL YOU WARM YOURSELF WITH THIS WINTER WE SHALL HAVE NO
WOOD
THERE IS THE SUN
THE BUTCHER REFUSES TO GIVE CREDIT HE WILL NOT LET US HAVE ANY MORE
MEAT
THAT IS QUITE RIGHT
I DO NOT DIGEST MEAT WELL
IT IS TOO HEAVY
WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER
BREAD
THE BAKER DEMANDS A SETTLEMENT AND SAYS 'NO MONEY NO BREAD
THAT IS WELL
WHAT WILL YOU EAT
WE HAVE APPLES IN THE APPLE ROOM
BUT MONSIEUR WE CAN'T LIVE LIKE THAT WITHOUT MONEY
I HAVE NONE
THE OLD WOMAN WENT AWAY THE OLD MAN REMAINED ALONE
HE FELL INTO
THOUGHT
GAVROCHE BECAME THOUGHTFUL ALSO
IT WAS ALMOST DARK
THE FIRST RESULT OF GAVROCHE'S MEDITATION WAS THAT INSTEAD OF SCALING
THE HEDGE HE CROUCHED DOWN UNDER IT
THE BRANCHES STOOD APART A LITTLE
AT THE FOOT OF THE THICKET
COME EXCLAIMED GAVROCHE MENTALLY HERE'S A NOOK AND HE CURLED UP
IN IT
HIS BACK WAS ALMOST IN CONTACT WITH FATHER MABEUF'S BENCH
HE
COULD HEAR THE OCTOGENARIAN BREATHE
THEN BY WAY OF DINNER HE TRIED TO SLEEP
IT WAS A CAT NAP WITH ONE EYE OPEN
WHILE HE DOZED GAVROCHE KEPT ON
THE WATCH
THE TWILIGHT PALLOR OF THE SKY BLANCHED THE EARTH AND THE LANE FORMED A
LIVID LINE BETWEEN TWO ROWS OF DARK BUSHES
ALL AT ONCE IN THIS WHITISH BAND TWO FIGURES MADE THEIR APPEARANCE
ONE WAS IN FRONT THE OTHER SOME DISTANCE IN THE REAR
THERE COME TWO CREATURES MUTTERED GAVROCHE
THE FIRST FORM SEEMED TO BE SOME ELDERLY BOURGEOIS WHO WAS BENT AND
THOUGHTFUL DRESSED MORE THAN PLAINLY AND WHO WAS WALKING SLOWLY
BECAUSE OF HIS AGE AND STROLLING ABOUT IN THE OPEN EVENING AIR
THE SECOND WAS STRAIGHT FIRM SLENDER
IT REGULATED ITS PACE BY THAT
OF THE FIRST BUT IN THE VOLUNTARY SLOWNESS OF ITS GAIT SUPPLENESS
AND AGILITY WERE DISCERNIBLE
THIS FIGURE HAD ALSO SOMETHING FIERCE AND
DISQUIETING ABOUT IT THE WHOLE SHAPE WAS THAT OF WHAT WAS THEN CALLED
AN ELEGANT THE HAT WAS OF GOOD SHAPE THE COAT BLACK WELL CUT
PROBABLY OF FINE CLOTH AND WELL FITTED IN AT THE WAIST
THE HEAD WAS
HELD ERECT WITH A SORT OF ROBUST GRACE AND BENEATH THE HAT THE PALE
PROFILE OF A YOUNG MAN COULD BE MADE OUT IN THE DIM LIGHT
THE PROFILE
HAD A ROSE IN ITS MOUTH
THIS SECOND FORM WAS WELL KNOWN TO GAVROCHE IT
WAS MONTPARNASSE
HE COULD HAVE TOLD NOTHING ABOUT THE OTHER EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A
RESPECTABLE OLD MAN
GAVROCHE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO TAKE OBSERVATIONS
ONE OF THESE TWO PEDESTRIANS EVIDENTLY HAD A PROJECT CONNECTED WITH
THE OTHER
GAVROCHE WAS WELL PLACED TO WATCH THE COURSE OF EVENTS
THE
BEDROOM HAD TURNED INTO A HIDING PLACE AT A VERY OPPORTUNE MOMENT
MONTPARNASSE ON THE HUNT AT SUCH AN HOUR IN SUCH A PLACE BETOKENED
SOMETHING THREATENING
GAVROCHE FELT HIS GAMIN'S HEART MOVED WITH
COMPASSION FOR THE OLD MAN
WHAT WAS HE TO DO INTERFERE ONE WEAKNESS COMING TO THE AID OF ANOTHER
IT WOULD BE MERELY A LAUGHING MATTER FOR MONTPARNASSE
GAVROCHE DID NOT
SHUT HIS EYES TO THE FACT THAT THE OLD MAN IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THE
CHILD IN THE SECOND WOULD MAKE BUT TWO MOUTHFULS FOR THAT REDOUBTABLE
RUFFIAN EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
WHILE GAVROCHE WAS DELIBERATING THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE ABRUPTLY AND
HIDEOUSLY
THE ATTACK OF THE TIGER ON THE WILD ASS THE ATTACK OF THE
SPIDER ON THE FLY
MONTPARNASSE SUDDENLY TOSSED AWAY HIS ROSE BOUNDED
UPON THE OLD MAN SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR GRASPED AND CLUNG TO HIM
AND GAVROCHE WITH DIFFICULTY RESTRAINED A SCREAM
A MOMENT LATER ONE OF
THESE MEN WAS UNDERNEATH THE OTHER GROANING STRUGGLING WITH A KNEE
OF MARBLE UPON HIS BREAST
ONLY IT WAS NOT JUST WHAT GAVROCHE HAD
EXPECTED
THE ONE WHO LAY ON THE EARTH WAS MONTPARNASSE THE ONE WHO
WAS ON TOP WAS THE OLD MAN
ALL THIS TOOK PLACE A FEW PACES DISTANT FROM
GAVROCHE
THE OLD MAN HAD RECEIVED THE SHOCK HAD RETURNED IT AND THAT IN SUCH
A TERRIBLE FASHION THAT IN A TWINKLING THE ASSAILANT AND THE ASSAILED
HAD EXCHANGED ROLES
HERE'S A HEARTY VETERAN THOUGHT GAVROCHE
HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM CLAPPING HIS HANDS
BUT IT WAS APPLAUSE
WASTED
IT DID NOT REACH THE COMBATANTS ABSORBED AND DEAFENED AS THEY
WERE EACH BY THE OTHER AS THEIR BREATH MINGLED IN THE STRUGGLE
SILENCE ENSUED
MONTPARNASSE CEASED HIS STRUGGLES
GAVROCHE INDULGED IN
THIS ASIDE CAN HE BE DEAD
THE GOODMAN HAD NOT UTTERED A WORD NOR GIVEN VENT TO A CRY
HE ROSE TO
HIS FEET AND GAVROCHE HEARD HIM SAY TO MONTPARNASSE
GET UP
MONTPARNASSE ROSE BUT THE GOODMAN HELD HIM FAST
MONTPARNASSE'S
ATTITUDE WAS THE HUMILIATED AND FURIOUS ATTITUDE OF THE WOLF WHO HAS
BEEN CAUGHT BY A SHEEP
GAVROCHE LOOKED ON AND LISTENED MAKING AN EFFORT TO REINFORCE HIS EYES
WITH HIS EARS
HE WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF IMMENSELY
HE WAS REPAID FOR HIS CONSCIENTIOUS ANXIETY IN THE CHARACTER OF A
SPECTATOR
HE WAS ABLE TO CATCH ON THE WING A DIALOGUE WHICH BORROWED
FROM THE DARKNESS AN INDESCRIBABLY TRAGIC ACCENT
THE GOODMAN
QUESTIONED MONTPARNASSE REPLIED
HOW OLD ARE YOU
NINETEEN
YOU ARE STRONG AND HEALTHY
WHY DO YOU NOT WORK
IT BORES ME
WHAT IS YOUR TRADE
AN IDLER
SPEAK SERIOUSLY
CAN ANYTHING BE DONE FOR YOU WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO
BE
A THIEF
A PAUSE ENSUED
THE OLD MAN SEEMED ABSORBED IN PROFOUND THOUGHT
HE
STOOD MOTIONLESS AND DID NOT RELAX HIS HOLD ON MONTPARNASSE
EVERY MOMENT THE VIGOROUS AND AGILE YOUNG RUFFIAN INDULGED IN THE
TWITCHINGS OF A WILD BEAST CAUGHT IN A SNARE
HE GAVE A JERK TRIED A
CROOK OF THE KNEE TWISTED HIS LIMBS DESPERATELY AND MADE EFFORTS TO
ESCAPE
THE OLD MAN DID NOT APPEAR TO NOTICE IT AND HELD BOTH HIS ARMS WITH ONE
HAND WITH THE SOVEREIGN INDIFFERENCE OF ABSOLUTE FORCE
THE OLD MAN'S REVERY LASTED FOR SOME TIME THEN LOOKING STEADILY AT
MONTPARNASSE HE ADDRESSED TO HIM IN A GENTLE VOICE IN THE MIDST OF THE
DARKNESS WHERE THEY STOOD A SOLEMN HARANGUE OF WHICH GAVROCHE DID NOT
LOSE A SINGLE SYLLABLE

LABORIOUS OF LIVES

BECOME VERMIN AH SO IT DOES NOT PLEASE YOU TO WORK AH YOU HAVE BUT
ONE THOUGHT TO DRINK WELL TO EAT WELL TO SLEEP WELL

YOU WILL BREAK THOSE FETTERS YOU WILL FLEE
THAT IS WELL
YOU WILL CRAWL ON YOUR BELLY THROUGH THE BRUSHWOOD AND YOU WILL EAT
GRASS LIKE THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST
AND YOU WILL BE RECAPTURED
AND
THEN YOU WILL PASS YEARS IN A DUNGEON RIVETED TO A WALL GROPING FOR
YOUR JUG THAT YOU MAY DRINK GNAWING AT A HORRIBLE LOAF OF DARKNESS
WHICH DOGS WOULD NOT TOUCH EATING BEANS THAT THE WORMS HAVE EATEN
BEFORE YOU
YOU WILL BE A WOOD LOUSE IN A CELLAR

ROSY FRESH WITH BRILLIANT EYES AND ALL YOUR WHITE TEETH AND YOUR
HANDSOME YOUTHFUL HAIR YOU WILL COME OUT BROKEN BENT WRINKLED
TOOTHLESS HORRIBLE WITH WHITE LOCKS AH MY POOR CHILD YOU ARE ON THE
WRONG ROAD IDLENESS IS COUNSELLING YOU BADLY THE HARDEST OF ALL WORK
IS THIEVING
BELIEVE ME DO NOT UNDERTAKE THAT PAINFUL PROFESSION OF
AN IDLE MAN
IT IS NOT COMFORTABLE TO BECOME A RASCAL
IT IS LESS
DISAGREEABLE TO BE AN HONEST MAN
NOW GO AND PONDER ON WHAT I HAVE SAID
TO YOU
BY THE WAY WHAT DID YOU WANT OF ME MY PURSE HERE IT IS
AND THE OLD MAN RELEASING MONTPARNASSE PUT HIS PURSE IN THE LATTER'S
HAND MONTPARNASSE WEIGHED IT FOR A MOMENT AFTER WHICH HE ALLOWED IT TO
SLIDE GENTLY INTO THE BACK POCKET OF HIS COAT WITH THE SAME MECHANICAL
PRECAUTION AS THOUGH HE HAD STOLEN IT
ALL THIS HAVING BEEN SAID AND DONE THE GOODMAN TURNED HIS BACK AND
TRANQUILLY RESUMED HIS STROLL
THE BLOCKHEAD MUTTERED MONTPARNASSE
WHO WAS THIS GOODMAN THE READER HAS NO DOUBT ALREADY DIVINED
MONTPARNASSE WATCHED HIM WITH AMAZEMENT AS HE DISAPPEARED IN THE DUSK
THIS CONTEMPLATION WAS FATAL TO HIM
WHILE THE OLD MAN WAS WALKING AWAY GAVROCHE DREW NEAR
GAVROCHE HAD ASSURED HIMSELF WITH A SIDELONG GLANCE THAT FATHER MABEUF
WAS STILL SITTING ON HIS BENCH PROBABLY SOUND ASLEEP
THEN THE GAMIN
EMERGED FROM HIS THICKET AND BEGAN TO CRAWL AFTER MONTPARNASSE IN THE
DARK AS THE LATTER STOOD THERE MOTIONLESS
IN THIS MANNER HE CAME UP
TO MONTPARNASSE WITHOUT BEING SEEN OR HEARD GENTLY INSINUATED HIS HAND
INTO THE BACK POCKET OF THAT FROCK COAT OF FINE BLACK CLOTH SEIZED THE
PURSE WITHDREW HIS HAND AND HAVING RECOURSE ONCE MORE TO HIS CRAWLING
HE SLIPPED AWAY LIKE AN ADDER THROUGH THE SHADOWS
MONTPARNASSE WHO
HAD NO REASON TO BE ON HIS GUARD AND WHO WAS ENGAGED IN THOUGHT FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE PERCEIVED NOTHING
WHEN GAVROCHE HAD ONCE MORE
ATTAINED THE POINT WHERE FATHER MABEUF WAS HE FLUNG THE PURSE OVER THE
HEDGE AND FLED AS FAST AS HIS LEGS WOULD CARRY HIM
THE PURSE FELL ON FATHER MABEUF'S FOOT
THIS COMMOTION ROUSED HIM
HE BENT OVER AND PICKED UP THE PURSE
HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST AND OPENED IT
THE PURSE HAD TWO COMPARTMENTS IN ONE OF THEM THERE WAS SOME SMALL
CHANGE IN THE OTHER LAY SIX NAPOLEONS
M
MABEUF IN GREAT ALARM REFERRED THE MATTER TO HIS HOUSEKEEPER
THAT HAS FALLEN FROM HEAVEN SAID MOTHER PLUTARQUE
BOOK FIFTH THE END OF WHICH DOES NOT RESEMBLE THE BEGINNING
CHAPTER I SOLITUDE AND THE BARRACKS COMBINED
COSETTE'S GRIEF WHICH HAD BEEN SO POIGNANT AND LIVELY FOUR OR FIVE
MONTHS PREVIOUSLY HAD WITHOUT HER BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT ENTERED
UPON ITS CONVALESCENCE
NATURE SPRING YOUTH LOVE FOR HER FATHER
THE GAYETY OF THE BIRDS AND FLOWERS CAUSED SOMETHING ALMOST RESEMBLING
FORGETFULNESS TO FILTER GRADUALLY DROP BY DROP INTO THAT SOUL WHICH
WAS SO VIRGIN AND SO YOUNG
WAS THE FIRE WHOLLY EXTINCT THERE OR WAS
IT MERELY THAT LAYERS OF ASHES HAD FORMED THE TRUTH IS THAT SHE HARDLY
FELT THE PAINFUL AND BURNING SPOT ANY LONGER
ONE DAY SHE SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF MARIUS WHY SAID SHE I NO LONGER
THINK OF HIM
THAT SAME WEEK SHE NOTICED A VERY HANDSOME OFFICER OF LANCERS WITH
A WASP LIKE WAIST A DELICIOUS UNIFORM THE CHEEKS OF A YOUNG GIRL A
SWORD UNDER HIS ARM WAXED MUSTACHES AND A GLAZED SCHAPKA PASSING THE
GATE
MOREOVER HE HAD LIGHT HAIR PROMINENT BLUE EYES A ROUND FACE
WAS VAIN INSOLENT AND GOOD LOOKING QUITE THE REVERSE OF MARIUS
HE
HAD A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH
COSETTE THOUGHT THAT THIS OFFICER DOUBTLESS
BELONGED TO THE REGIMENT IN BARRACKS IN THE RUE DE BABYLONE
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY SHE SAW HIM PASS AGAIN
SHE TOOK NOTE OF THE HOUR
FROM THAT TIME FORTH WAS IT CHANCE SHE SAW HIM PASS NEARLY EVERY DAY
THE OFFICER'S COMRADES PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS IN THAT BADLY KEPT
GARDEN BEHIND THAT MALICIOUS ROCOCO FENCE A VERY PRETTY CREATURE
WHO WAS ALMOST ALWAYS THERE WHEN THE HANDSOME LIEUTENANT WHO IS NOT
UNKNOWN TO THE READER AND WHOSE NAME WAS THEODULE GILLENORMAND PASSED
BY
SEE HERE THEY SAID TO HIM THERE'S A LITTLE CREATURE THERE WHO IS
MAKING EYES AT YOU LOOK
HAVE I THE TIME REPLIED THE LANCER TO LOOK AT ALL THE GIRLS WHO
LOOK AT ME
THIS WAS AT THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN MARIUS WAS DESCENDING HEAVILY
TOWARDS AGONY AND WAS SAYING IF I COULD BUT SEE HER BEFORE I
DIE HAD HIS WISH BEEN REALIZED HAD HE BEHELD COSETTE AT THAT MOMENT
GAZING AT THE LANCER HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UTTER A WORD AND
HE WOULD HAVE EXPIRED WITH GRIEF
WHOSE FAULT WAS IT NO ONE'S
MARIUS POSSESSED ONE OF THOSE TEMPERAMENTS WHICH BURY THEMSELVES IN
SORROW AND THERE ABIDE COSETTE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHO PLUNGE INTO
SORROW AND EMERGE FROM IT AGAIN
COSETTE WAS MOREOVER PASSING THROUGH THAT DANGEROUS PERIOD THE FATAL
PHASE OF FEMININE REVERY ABANDONED TO ITSELF IN WHICH THE ISOLATED
HEART OF A YOUNG GIRL RESEMBLES THE TENDRILS OF THE VINE WHICH CLING
AS CHANCE DIRECTS TO THE CAPITAL OF A MARBLE COLUMN OR TO THE POST OF
A WINE SHOP A RAPID AND DECISIVE MOMENT CRITICAL FOR EVERY ORPHAN BE
SHE RICH OR POOR FOR WEALTH DOES NOT PREVENT A BAD CHOICE MISALLIANCES
ARE MADE IN VERY HIGH CIRCLES REAL MISALLIANCE IS THAT OF SOULS AND AS
MANY AN UNKNOWN YOUNG MAN WITHOUT NAME WITHOUT BIRTH WITHOUT FORTUNE
IS A MARBLE COLUMN WHICH BEARS UP A TEMPLE OF GRAND SENTIMENTS AND GRAND
IDEAS SO SUCH AND SUCH A MAN OF THE WORLD SATISFIED AND OPULENT WHO
HAS POLISHED BOOTS AND VARNISHED WORDS IF LOOKED AT NOT OUTSIDE BUT
INSIDE A THING WHICH IS RESERVED FOR HIS WIFE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A
BLOCK OBSCURELY HAUNTED BY VIOLENT UNCLEAN AND VINOUS PASSIONS THE
POST OF A DRINKING SHOP
WHAT DID COSETTE'S SOUL CONTAIN PASSION CALMED OR LULLED TO SLEEP
SOMETHING LIMPID BRILLIANT TROUBLED TO A CERTAIN DEPTH AND GLOOMY
LOWER DOWN
THE IMAGE OF THE HANDSOME OFFICER WAS REFLECTED IN
THE SURFACE
DID A SOUVENIR LINGER IN THE DEPTHS QUITE AT THE
BOTTOM POSSIBLY
COSETTE DID NOT KNOW
A SINGULAR INCIDENT SUPERVENED
CHAPTER II COSETTE'S APPREHENSIONS
DURING THE FIRST FORTNIGHT IN APRIL JEAN VALJEAN TOOK A JOURNEY
THIS
AS THE READER KNOWS HAPPENED FROM TIME TO TIME AT VERY LONG INTERVALS
HE REMAINED ABSENT A DAY OR TWO DAYS AT THE UTMOST
WHERE DID HE GO NO
ONE KNEW NOT EVEN COSETTE
ONCE ONLY ON THE OCCASION OF ONE OF THESE
DEPARTURES SHE HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM IN A HACKNEY COACH AS FAR AS A
LITTLE BLIND ALLEY AT THE CORNER OF WHICH SHE READ IMPASSE DE LA
PLANCHETTE
THERE HE ALIGHTED AND THE COACH TOOK COSETTE BACK TO THE
RUE DE BABYLONE
IT WAS USUALLY WHEN MONEY WAS LACKING IN THE HOUSE THAT
JEAN VALJEAN TOOK THESE LITTLE TRIPS
SO JEAN VALJEAN WAS ABSENT
HE HAD SAID I SHALL RETURN IN THREE DAYS
THAT EVENING COSETTE WAS ALONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM
IN ORDER TO GET
RID OF HER ENNUI SHE HAD OPENED HER PIANO ORGAN AND HAD BEGUN TO SING
ACCOMPANYING HERSELF THE WHILE THE CHORUS FROM EURYANTHE HUNTERS
ASTRAY IN THE WOOD WHICH IS PROBABLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN ALL
THE SPHERE OF MUSIC
WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE REMAINED WRAPPED IN
THOUGHT
ALL AT ONCE IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS IN
THE GARDEN
IT COULD NOT BE HER FATHER HE WAS ABSENT IT COULD NOT BE TOUSSAINT
SHE WAS IN BED AND IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
SHE STEPPED TO THE SHUTTER OF THE DRAWING ROOM WHICH WAS CLOSED AND
LAID HER EAR AGAINST IT
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT IT WAS THE TREAD OF A MAN AND THAT HE WAS WALKING
VERY SOFTLY
SHE MOUNTED RAPIDLY TO THE FIRST FLOOR TO HER OWN CHAMBER OPENED A
SMALL WICKET IN HER SHUTTER AND PEEPED INTO THE GARDEN
THE MOON WAS AT
THE FULL
EVERYTHING COULD BE SEEN AS PLAINLY AS BY DAY
THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
SHE OPENED THE WINDOW
THE GARDEN WAS ABSOLUTELY CALM AND ALL THAT WAS
VISIBLE WAS THAT THE STREET WAS DESERTED AS USUAL
COSETTE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD
HEARD A NOISE
IT WAS A HALLUCINATION PRODUCED BY THE MELANCHOLY AND
MAGNIFICENT CHORUS OF WEBER WHICH LAYS OPEN BEFORE THE MIND TERRIFIED
DEPTHS WHICH TREMBLES BEFORE THE GAZE LIKE A DIZZY FOREST AND IN WHICH
ONE HEARS THE CRACKLING OF DEAD BRANCHES BENEATH THE UNEASY TREAD OF THE
HUNTSMEN OF WHOM ONE CATCHES A GLIMPSE THROUGH THE TWILIGHT
SHE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT
MOREOVER COSETTE WAS NOT VERY TIMID BY NATURE
THERE FLOWED IN HER
VEINS SOME OF THE BLOOD OF THE BOHEMIAN AND THE ADVENTURESS WHO RUNS
BAREFOOT
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT SHE WAS MORE OF A LARK THAN A DOVE
THERE WAS A FOUNDATION OF WILDNESS AND BRAVERY IN HER
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT AN EARLIER HOUR TOWARDS NIGHTFALL SHE WAS
STROLLING IN THE GARDEN
IN THE MIDST OF THE CONFUSED THOUGHTS WHICH
OCCUPIED HER SHE FANCIED THAT SHE CAUGHT FOR AN INSTANT A SOUND SIMILAR
TO THAT OF THE PRECEDING EVENING AS THOUGH SOME ONE WERE WALKING
BENEATH THE TREES IN THE DUSK AND NOT VERY FAR FROM HER BUT SHE TOLD
HERSELF THAT NOTHING SO CLOSELY RESEMBLES A STEP ON THE GRASS AS THE
FRICTION OF TWO BRANCHES WHICH HAVE MOVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND SHE
PAID NO HEED TO IT
BESIDES SHE COULD SEE NOTHING
SHE EMERGED FROM THE THICKET SHE HAD STILL TO CROSS A SMALL LAWN TO
REGAIN THE STEPS
THE MOON WHICH HAD JUST RISEN BEHIND HER CAST COSETTE'S SHADOW IN
FRONT OF HER UPON THIS LAWN AS SHE CAME OUT FROM THE SHRUBBERY
COSETTE HALTED IN ALARM
BESIDE HER SHADOW THE MOON OUTLINED DISTINCTLY UPON THE TURF ANOTHER
SHADOW WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY STARTLING AND TERRIBLE A SHADOW WHICH
HAD A ROUND HAT
IT WAS THE SHADOW OF A MAN WHO MUST HAVE BEEN STANDING ON THE BORDER OF
THE CLUMP OF SHRUBBERY A FEW PACES IN THE REAR OF COSETTE
SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT THE POWER TO SPEAK OR CRY OR CALL OR
STIR OR TURN HER HEAD
THEN SHE SUMMONED UP ALL HER COURAGE AND TURNED ROUND RESOLUTELY
THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
SHE GLANCED ON THE GROUND
THE FIGURE HAD DISAPPEARED
SHE RE ENTERED THE THICKET SEARCHED THE CORNERS BOLDLY WENT AS FAR AS
THE GATE AND FOUND NOTHING
SHE FELT HERSELF ABSOLUTELY CHILLED WITH TERROR
WAS THIS ANOTHER
HALLUCINATION WHAT TWO DAYS IN SUCCESSION ONE HALLUCINATION MIGHT
PASS BUT TWO HALLUCINATIONS THE DISQUIETING POINT ABOUT IT WAS THAT
THE SHADOW HAD ASSUREDLY NOT BEEN A PHANTOM
PHANTOMS DO NOT WEAR ROUND
HATS
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY JEAN VALJEAN RETURNED
COSETTE TOLD HIM WHAT SHE
THOUGHT SHE HAD HEARD AND SEEN
SHE WANTED TO BE REASSURED AND TO SEE
HER FATHER SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS AND SAY TO HER YOU ARE A LITTLE GOOSE
JEAN VALJEAN GREW ANXIOUS
IT CANNOT BE ANYTHING SAID HE
HE LEFT HER UNDER SOME PRETEXT AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND SHE SAW
HIM EXAMINING THE GATE WITH GREAT ATTENTION
DURING THE NIGHT SHE WOKE UP THIS TIME SHE WAS SURE AND SHE DISTINCTLY
HEARD SOME ONE WALKING CLOSE TO THE FLIGHT OF STEPS BENEATH HER WINDOW
SHE RAN TO HER LITTLE WICKET AND OPENED IT
IN POINT OF FACT THERE
WAS A MAN IN THE GARDEN WITH A LARGE CLUB IN HIS HAND
JUST AS SHE
WAS ABOUT TO SCREAM THE MOON LIGHTED UP THE MAN'S PROFILE
IT WAS HER
FATHER
SHE RETURNED TO HER BED SAYING TO HERSELF HE IS VERY UNEASY
JEAN VALJEAN PASSED THAT NIGHT AND THE TWO SUCCEEDING NIGHTS IN THE
GARDEN
COSETTE SAW HIM THROUGH THE HOLE IN HER SHUTTER
ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE MOON WAS ON THE WANE AND HAD BEGUN TO RISE
LATER AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING POSSIBLY SHE HEARD A LOUD BURST
OF LAUGHTER AND HER FATHER'S VOICE CALLING HER
COSETTE
SHE JUMPED OUT OF BED THREW ON HER DRESSING GOWN AND OPENED HER
WINDOW
HER FATHER WAS STANDING ON THE GRASS PLOT BELOW
I HAVE WAKED YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF REASSURING YOU SAID HE LOOK
THERE IS YOUR SHADOW WITH THE ROUND HAT
AND HE POINTED OUT TO HER ON THE TURF A SHADOW CAST BY THE MOON AND
WHICH DID INDEED BEAR CONSIDERABLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE SPECTRE OF A MAN
WEARING A ROUND HAT
IT WAS THE SHADOW PRODUCED BY A CHIMNEY PIPE OF
SHEET IRON WITH A HOOD WHICH ROSE ABOVE A NEIGHBORING ROOF
COSETTE JOINED IN HIS LAUGHTER ALL HER LUGUBRIOUS SUPPOSITIONS WERE
ALLAYED AND THE NEXT MORNING AS SHE WAS AT BREAKFAST WITH HER FATHER
SHE MADE MERRY OVER THE SINISTER GARDEN HAUNTED BY THE SHADOWS OF IRON
CHIMNEY POTS
JEAN VALJEAN BECAME QUITE TRANQUIL ONCE MORE AS FOR COSETTE SHE DID
NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CHIMNEY POT WAS
REALLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SHADOW WHICH SHE HAD SEEN OR THOUGHT SHE
HAD SEEN AND WHETHER THE MOON HAD BEEN IN THE SAME SPOT IN THE SKY
SHE DID NOT QUESTION HERSELF AS TO THE PECULIARITY OF A CHIMNEY POT
WHICH IS AFRAID OF BEING CAUGHT IN THE ACT AND WHICH RETIRES WHEN SOME
ONE LOOKS AT ITS SHADOW FOR THE SHADOW HAD TAKEN THE ALARM WHEN COSETTE
HAD TURNED ROUND AND COSETTE HAD THOUGHT HERSELF VERY SURE OF THIS
COSETTE'S SERENITY WAS FULLY RESTORED
THE PROOF APPEARED TO HER TO
BE COMPLETE AND IT QUITE VANISHED FROM HER MIND WHETHER THERE COULD
POSSIBLY BE ANY ONE WALKING IN THE GARDEN DURING THE EVENING OR AT
NIGHT
A FEW DAYS LATER HOWEVER A FRESH INCIDENT OCCURRED
CHAPTER III ENRICHED WITH COMMENTARIES BY TOUSSAINT
IN THE GARDEN NEAR THE RAILING ON THE STREET THERE WAS A STONE BENCH
SCREENED FROM THE EYES OF THE CURIOUS BY A PLANTATION OF YOKE ELMS
BUT WHICH COULD IN CASE OF NECESSITY BE REACHED BY AN ARM FROM THE
OUTSIDE PAST THE TREES AND THE GATE
ONE EVENING DURING THAT SAME MONTH OF APRIL JEAN VALJEAN HAD GONE OUT
COSETTE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THIS BENCH AFTER SUNDOWN
THE BREEZE WAS
BLOWING BRISKLY IN THE TREES COSETTE WAS MEDITATING AN OBJECTLESS
SADNESS WAS TAKING POSSESSION OF HER LITTLE BY LITTLE THAT INVINCIBLE
SADNESS EVOKED BY THE EVENING AND WHICH ARISES PERHAPS WHO KNOWS
FROM THE MYSTERY OF THE TOMB WHICH IS AJAR AT THAT HOUR
PERHAPS FANTINE WAS WITHIN THAT SHADOW
COSETTE ROSE SLOWLY MADE THE TOUR OF THE GARDEN WALKING ON THE
GRASS DRENCHED IN DEW AND SAYING TO HERSELF THROUGH THE SPECIES OF
MELANCHOLY SOMNAMBULISM IN WHICH SHE WAS PLUNGED REALLY ONE NEEDS
WOODEN SHOES FOR THE GARDEN AT THIS HOUR
ONE TAKES COLD
SHE RETURNED TO THE BENCH
AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO RESUME HER SEAT THERE SHE OBSERVED ON THE SPOT
WHICH SHE HAD QUITTED A TOLERABLY LARGE STONE WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY NOT
BEEN THERE A MOMENT BEFORE
COSETTE GAZED AT THE STONE ASKING HERSELF WHAT IT MEANT
ALL AT ONCE
THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HER THAT THE STONE HAD NOT REACHED THE BENCH ALL BY
ITSELF THAT SOME ONE HAD PLACED IT THERE THAT AN ARM HAD BEEN THRUST
THROUGH THE RAILING AND THIS IDEA APPEARED TO ALARM HER
THIS TIME THE
FEAR WAS GENUINE THE STONE WAS THERE
NO DOUBT WAS POSSIBLE SHE DID
NOT TOUCH IT FLED WITHOUT GLANCING BEHIND HER TOOK REFUGE IN THE
HOUSE AND IMMEDIATELY CLOSED WITH SHUTTER BOLT AND BAR THE DOOR LIKE
WINDOW OPENING ON THE FLIGHT OF STEPS
SHE INQUIRED OF TOUSSAINT
HAS MY FATHER RETURNED YET
NOT YET MADEMOISELLE
WE HAVE ALREADY NOTED ONCE FOR ALL THE FACT THAT TOUSSAINT STUTTERED
MAY WE BE PERMITTED TO DISPENSE WITH IT FOR THE FUTURE
THE MUSICAL
NOTATION OF AN INFIRMITY IS REPUGNANT TO US
JEAN VALJEAN A THOUGHTFUL MAN AND GIVEN TO NOCTURNAL STROLLS OFTEN
RETURNED QUITE LATE AT NIGHT
TOUSSAINT WENT ON COSETTE ARE YOU CAREFUL TO THOROUGHLY BARRICADE
THE SHUTTERS OPENING ON THE GARDEN AT LEAST WITH BARS IN THE EVENING
AND TO PUT THE LITTLE IRON THINGS IN THE LITTLE RINGS THAT CLOSE THEM
OH BE EASY ON THAT SCORE MISS
TOUSSAINT DID NOT FAIL IN HER DUTY AND COSETTE WAS WELL AWARE OF THE
FACT BUT SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ADDING
IT IS SO SOLITARY HERE
SO FAR AS THAT IS CONCERNED SAID TOUSSAINT IT IS TRUE
WE MIGHT BE
ASSASSINATED BEFORE WE HAD TIME TO SAY OUF AND MONSIEUR DOES NOT SLEEP
IN THE HOUSE TO BOOT
BUT FEAR NOTHING MISS I FASTEN THE SHUTTERS UP
LIKE PRISONS
LONE WOMEN THAT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE SHUDDER I BELIEVE
YOU JUST IMAGINE WHAT IF YOU WERE TO SEE MEN ENTER YOUR CHAMBER AT
NIGHT AND SAY 'HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND BEGIN TO CUT YOUR THROAT
IT'S
NOT THE DYING SO MUCH YOU DIE FOR ONE MUST DIE AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT
IT'S THE ABOMINATION OF FEELING THOSE PEOPLE TOUCH YOU
AND THEN THEIR
KNIVES THEY CAN'T BE ABLE TO CUT WELL WITH THEM AH GOOD GRACIOUS
BE QUIET SAID COSETTE
FASTEN EVERYTHING THOROUGHLY
COSETTE TERRIFIED BY THE MELODRAMA IMPROVISED BY TOUSSAINT AND
POSSIBLY ALSO BY THE RECOLLECTION OF THE APPARITIONS OF THE PAST WEEK
WHICH RECURRED TO HER MEMORY DARED NOT EVEN SAY TO HER GO AND LOOK AT
THE STONE WHICH HAS BEEN PLACED ON THE BENCH FOR FEAR OF OPENING THE
GARDEN GATE AND ALLOWING THE MEN TO ENTER
SHE SAW THAT ALL THE DOORS
AND WINDOWS WERE CAREFULLY FASTENED MADE TOUSSAINT GO ALL OVER THE
HOUSE FROM GARRET TO CELLAR LOCKED HERSELF UP IN HER OWN CHAMBER
BOLTED HER DOOR LOOKED UNDER HER COUCH WENT TO BED AND SLEPT BADLY
ALL NIGHT LONG SHE SAW THAT BIG STONE AS LARGE AS A MOUNTAIN AND FULL
OF CAVERNS
AT SUNRISE THE PROPERTY OF THE RISING SUN IS TO MAKE US LAUGH AT ALL
OUR TERRORS OF THE PAST NIGHT AND OUR LAUGHTER IS IN DIRECT PROPORTION
TO OUR TERROR WHICH THEY HAVE CAUSED AT SUNRISE COSETTE WHEN SHE
WOKE VIEWED HER FRIGHT AS A NIGHTMARE AND SAID TO HERSELF WHAT HAVE
I BEEN THINKING OF IT IS LIKE THE FOOTSTEPS THAT I THOUGHT I HEARD A
WEEK OR TWO AGO IN THE GARDEN AT NIGHT IT IS LIKE THE SHADOW OF THE
CHIMNEY POT AM I BECOMING A COWARD THE SUN WHICH WAS GLOWING THROUGH
THE CREVICES IN HER SHUTTERS AND TURNING THE DAMASK CURTAINS CRIMSON
REASSURED HER TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT EVERYTHING VANISHED FROM HER
THOUGHTS EVEN THE STONE
THERE WAS NO MORE A STONE ON THE BENCH THAN THERE WAS A MAN IN A ROUND
HAT IN THE GARDEN I DREAMED ABOUT THE STONE AS I DID ALL THE REST
SHE DRESSED HERSELF DESCENDED TO THE GARDEN RAN TO THE BENCH AND
BROKE OUT IN A COLD PERSPIRATION
THE STONE WAS THERE
BUT THIS LASTED ONLY FOR A MOMENT
THAT WHICH IS TERROR BY NIGHT IS
CURIOSITY BY DAY
BAH SAID SHE COME LET US SEE WHAT IT IS
SHE LIFTED THE STONE WHICH WAS TOLERABLY LARGE
BENEATH IT WAS
SOMETHING WHICH RESEMBLED A LETTER
IT WAS A WHITE ENVELOPE
COSETTE
SEIZED IT
THERE WAS NO ADDRESS ON ONE SIDE NO SEAL ON THE OTHER
YET THE ENVELOPE THOUGH UNSEALED WAS NOT EMPTY
PAPERS COULD BE SEEN
INSIDE
COSETTE EXAMINED IT
IT WAS NO LONGER ALARM IT WAS NO LONGER CURIOSITY
IT WAS A BEGINNING OF ANXIETY
COSETTE DREW FROM THE ENVELOPE ITS CONTENTS A LITTLE NOTEBOOK OF PAPER
EACH PAGE OF WHICH WAS NUMBERED AND BORE A FEW LINES IN A VERY FINE AND
RATHER PRETTY HANDWRITING AS COSETTE THOUGHT
COSETTE LOOKED FOR A NAME THERE WAS NONE
TO WHOM WAS THIS ADDRESSED
TO HER PROBABLY SINCE A HAND HAD DEPOSITED THE PACKET ON HER BENCH
FROM WHOM DID IT COME AN IRRESISTIBLE FASCINATION TOOK POSSESSION
OF HER SHE TRIED TO TURN AWAY HER EYES FROM THE LEAFLETS WHICH WERE
TREMBLING IN HER HAND SHE GAZED AT THE SKY THE STREET THE ACACIAS
ALL BATHED IN LIGHT THE PIGEONS FLUTTERING OVER A NEIGHBORING ROOF
AND THEN HER GLANCE SUDDENLY FELL UPON THE MANUSCRIPT AND SHE SAID TO
HERSELF THAT SHE MUST KNOW WHAT IT CONTAINED
THIS IS WHAT SHE READ
CHAPTER IV A HEART BENEATH A STONE
ILLUSTRATION COSETTE WITH LETTER 4B4 5 COSETTE AFTER LETTER
THE REDUCTION OF THE UNIVERSE TO A SINGLE BEING THE EXPANSION OF A
SINGLE BEING EVEN TO GOD THAT IS LOVE
LOVE IS THE SALUTATION OF THE ANGELS TO THE STARS
HOW SAD IS THE SOUL WHEN IT IS SAD THROUGH LOVE
WHAT A VOID IN THE ABSENCE OF THE BEING WHO BY HERSELF ALONE FILLS THE
WORLD OH HOW TRUE IT IS THAT THE BELOVED BEING BECOMES GOD
ONE COULD
COMPREHEND THAT GOD MIGHT BE JEALOUS OF THIS HAD NOT GOD THE FATHER OF
ALL EVIDENTLY MADE CREATION FOR THE SOUL AND THE SOUL FOR LOVE
THE GLIMPSE OF A SMILE BENEATH A WHITE CRAPE BONNET WITH A LILAC CURTAIN
IS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE THE SOUL TO ENTER INTO THE PALACE OF DREAMS
GOD IS BEHIND EVERYTHING BUT EVERYTHING HIDES GOD
THINGS ARE
BLACK CREATURES ARE OPAQUE
TO LOVE A BEING IS TO RENDER THAT BEING
TRANSPARENT
CERTAIN THOUGHTS ARE PRAYERS
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WHATEVER THE
ATTITUDE OF THE BODY MAY BE THE SOUL IS ON ITS KNEES
PARTED LOVERS BEGUILE ABSENCE BY A THOUSAND CHIMERICAL DEVICES WHICH
POSSESS HOWEVER A REALITY OF THEIR OWN
THEY ARE PREVENTED FROM SEEING
EACH OTHER THEY CANNOT WRITE TO EACH OTHER THEY DISCOVER A MULTITUDE
OF MYSTERIOUS MEANS TO CORRESPOND
THEY SEND EACH OTHER THE SONG OF THE
BIRDS THE PERFUME OF THE FLOWERS THE SMILES OF CHILDREN THE LIGHT OF
THE SUN THE SIGHINGS OF THE BREEZE THE RAYS OF STARS ALL CREATION
AND WHY NOT ALL THE WORKS OF GOD ARE MADE TO SERVE LOVE
LOVE IS
SUFFICIENTLY POTENT TO CHARGE ALL NATURE WITH ITS MESSAGES
OH SPRING THOU ART A LETTER THAT I WRITE TO HER
THE FUTURE BELONGS TO HEARTS EVEN MORE THAN IT DOES TO MINDS
LOVE THAT
IS THE ONLY THING THAT CAN OCCUPY AND FILL ETERNITY
IN THE INFINITE
THE INEXHAUSTIBLE IS REQUISITE
LOVE PARTICIPATES OF THE SOUL ITSELF
IT IS OF THE SAME NATURE
LIKE
IT IT IS THE DIVINE SPARK LIKE IT IT IS INCORRUPTIBLE INDIVISIBLE
IMPERISHABLE
IT IS A POINT OF FIRE THAT EXISTS WITHIN US WHICH IS
IMMORTAL AND INFINITE WHICH NOTHING CAN CONFINE AND WHICH NOTHING CAN
EXTINGUISH
WE FEEL IT BURNING EVEN TO THE VERY MARROW OF OUR BONES AND
WE SEE IT BEAMING IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF HEAVEN
OH LOVE ADORATIONS VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF TWO MINDS WHICH UNDERSTAND EACH
OTHER OF TWO HEARTS WHICH EXCHANGE WITH EACH OTHER OF TWO GLANCES
WHICH PENETRATE EACH OTHER YOU WILL COME TO ME WILL YOU NOT BLISS
STROLLS BY TWOS IN THE SOLITUDES BLESSED AND RADIANT DAYS I HAVE
SOMETIMES DREAMED THAT FROM TIME TO TIME HOURS DETACHED THEMSELVES FROM
THE LIVES OF THE ANGELS AND CAME HERE BELOW TO TRAVERSE THE DESTINIES OF
MEN
GOD CAN ADD NOTHING TO THE HAPPINESS OF THOSE WHO LOVE EXCEPT TO GIVE
THEM ENDLESS DURATION
AFTER A LIFE OF LOVE AN ETERNITY OF LOVE IS IN
FACT AN AUGMENTATION BUT TO INCREASE IN INTENSITY EVEN THE INEFFABLE
FELICITY WHICH LOVE BESTOWS ON THE SOUL EVEN IN THIS WORLD IS
IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO GOD
GOD IS THE PLENITUDE OF HEAVEN LOVE IS THE
PLENITUDE OF MAN
YOU LOOK AT A STAR FOR TWO REASONS BECAUSE IT IS LUMINOUS AND BECAUSE
IT IS IMPENETRABLE
YOU HAVE BESIDE YOU A SWEETER RADIANCE AND A GREATER
MYSTERY WOMAN
ALL OF US WHOEVER WE MAY BE HAVE OUR RESPIRABLE BEINGS
WE LACK
AIR AND WE STIFLE
THEN WE DIE
TO DIE FOR LACK OF LOVE IS HORRIBLE
SUFFOCATION OF THE SOUL
WHEN LOVE HAS FUSED AND MINGLED TWO BEINGS IN A SACRED AND ANGELIC
UNITY THE SECRET OF LIFE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED SO FAR AS THEY ARE
CONCERNED THEY ARE NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE THAN THE TWO BOUNDARIES OF
THE SAME DESTINY THEY ARE NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT THE TWO WINGS OF THE
SAME SPIRIT
LOVE SOAR
ON THE DAY WHEN A WOMAN AS SHE PASSES BEFORE YOU EMITS LIGHT AS SHE
WALKS YOU ARE LOST YOU LOVE
BUT ONE THING REMAINS FOR YOU TO DO TO
THINK OF HER SO INTENTLY THAT SHE IS CONSTRAINED TO THINK OF YOU
WHAT LOVE COMMENCES CAN BE FINISHED BY GOD ALONE
TRUE LOVE IS IN DESPAIR AND IS ENCHANTED OVER A GLOVE LOST OR A
HANDKERCHIEF FOUND AND ETERNITY IS REQUIRED FOR ITS DEVOTION AND ITS
HOPES
IT IS COMPOSED BOTH OF THE INFINITELY GREAT AND THE INFINITELY
LITTLE
IF YOU ARE A STONE BE ADAMANT IF YOU ARE A PLANT BE THE SENSITIVE
PLANT IF YOU ARE A MAN BE LOVE
NOTHING SUFFICES FOR LOVE
WE HAVE HAPPINESS WE DESIRE PARADISE WE
POSSESS PARADISE WE DESIRE HEAVEN
OH YE WHO LOVE EACH OTHER ALL THIS IS CONTAINED IN LOVE
UNDERSTAND
HOW TO FIND IT THERE
LOVE HAS CONTEMPLATION AS WELL AS HEAVEN AND MORE
THAN HEAVEN IT HAS VOLUPTUOUSNESS
DOES SHE STILL COME TO THE LUXEMBOURG NO SIR THIS IS THE CHURCH
WHERE SHE ATTENDS MASS IS IT NOT SHE NO LONGER COMES HERE DOES
SHE STILL LIVE IN THIS HOUSE SHE HAS MOVED AWAY WHERE HAS SHE GONE
TO DWELL
SHE DID NOT SAY
WHAT A MELANCHOLY THING NOT TO KNOW THE ADDRESS OF ONE'S SOUL
LOVE HAS ITS CHILDISHNESS OTHER PASSIONS HAVE THEIR PETTINESSES
SHAME
ON THE PASSIONS WHICH BELITTLE MAN HONOR TO THE ONE WHICH MAKES A CHILD
OF HIM
THERE IS ONE STRANGE THING DO YOU KNOW IT I DWELL IN THE NIGHT
THERE
IS A BEING WHO CARRIED OFF MY SKY WHEN SHE WENT AWAY
OH WOULD THAT WE WERE LYING SIDE BY SIDE IN THE SAME GRAVE HAND
IN HAND AND FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE DARKNESS GENTLY CARESSING A
FINGER THAT WOULD SUFFICE FOR MY ETERNITY
YE WHO SUFFER BECAUSE YE LOVE LOVE YET MORE
TO DIE OF LOVE IS TO LIVE
IN IT
LOVE
A SOMBRE AND STARRY TRANSFIGURATION IS MINGLED WITH THIS TORTURE
THERE IS ECSTASY IN AGONY
OH JOY OF THE BIRDS IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NESTS THAT THEY SING
LOVE IS A CELESTIAL RESPIRATION OF THE AIR OF PARADISE
DEEP HEARTS SAGE MINDS TAKE LIFE AS GOD HAS MADE IT IT IS A LONG
TRIAL AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE PREPARATION FOR AN UNKNOWN DESTINY
THIS
DESTINY THE TRUE ONE BEGINS FOR A MAN WITH THE FIRST STEP INSIDE THE
TOMB
THEN SOMETHING APPEARS TO HIM AND HE BEGINS TO DISTINGUISH THE
DEFINITIVE
THE DEFINITIVE MEDITATE UPON THAT WORD
THE LIVING PERCEIVE
THE INFINITE THE DEFINITIVE PERMITS ITSELF TO BE SEEN ONLY BY THE DEAD
IN THE MEANWHILE LOVE AND SUFFER HOPE AND CONTEMPLATE
WOE ALAS TO
HIM WHO SHALL HAVE LOVED ONLY BODIES FORMS APPEARANCES DEATH WILL
DEPRIVE HIM OF ALL
TRY TO LOVE SOULS YOU WILL FIND THEM AGAIN
I ENCOUNTERED IN THE STREET A VERY POOR YOUNG MAN WHO WAS IN LOVE
HIS
HAT WAS OLD HIS COAT WAS WORN HIS ELBOWS WERE IN HOLES WATER TRICKLED
THROUGH HIS SHOES AND THE STARS THROUGH HIS SOUL
WHAT A GRAND THING IT IS TO BE LOVED WHAT A FAR GRANDER THING IT IS
TO LOVE THE HEART BECOMES HEROIC BY DINT OF PASSION
IT IS NO LONGER
COMPOSED OF ANYTHING BUT WHAT IS PURE IT NO LONGER RESTS ON ANYTHING
THAT IS NOT ELEVATED AND GREAT
AN UNWORTHY THOUGHT CAN NO MORE
GERMINATE IN IT THAN A NETTLE ON A GLACIER
THE SERENE AND LOFTY SOUL
INACCESSIBLE TO VULGAR PASSIONS AND EMOTIONS DOMINATING THE CLOUDS
AND THE SHADES OF THIS WORLD ITS FOLLIES ITS LIES ITS HATREDS ITS
VANITIES ITS MISERIES INHABITS THE BLUE OF HEAVEN AND NO LONGER FEELS
ANYTHING BUT PROFOUND AND SUBTERRANEAN SHOCKS OF DESTINY AS THE CRESTS
OF MOUNTAINS FEEL THE SHOCKS OF EARTHQUAKE
IF THERE DID NOT EXIST SOME ONE WHO LOVED THE SUN WOULD BECOME EXTINCT
CHAPTER V COSETTE AFTER THE LETTER
AS COSETTE READ SHE GRADUALLY FELL INTO THOUGHT
AT THE VERY MOMENT
WHEN SHE RAISED HER EYES FROM THE LAST LINE OF THE NOTE BOOK THE
HANDSOME OFFICER PASSED TRIUMPHANTLY IN FRONT OF THE GATE IT WAS HIS
HOUR COSETTE THOUGHT HIM HIDEOUS
SHE RESUMED HER CONTEMPLATION OF THE BOOK
IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE MOST
CHARMING OF CHIROGRAPHY THOUGHT COSETTE IN THE SAME HAND BUT WITH
DIVERS INKS SOMETIMES VERY BLACK AGAIN WHITISH AS WHEN INK HAS BEEN
ADDED TO THE INKSTAND AND CONSEQUENTLY ON DIFFERENT DAYS
IT WAS
THEN A MIND WHICH HAD UNFOLDED ITSELF THERE SIGH BY SIGH IRREGULARLY
WITHOUT ORDER WITHOUT CHOICE WITHOUT OBJECT HAP HAZARD
COSETTE
HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING LIKE IT
THIS MANUSCRIPT IN WHICH SHE ALREADY
PERCEIVED MORE LIGHT THAN OBSCURITY PRODUCED UPON HER THE EFFECT OF A
HALF OPEN SANCTUARY
EACH ONE OF THESE MYSTERIOUS LINES SHONE BEFORE
HER EYES AND INUNDATED HER HEART WITH A STRANGE RADIANCE
THE EDUCATION
WHICH SHE HAD RECEIVED HAD ALWAYS TALKED TO HER OF THE SOUL AND NEVER
OF LOVE VERY MUCH AS ONE MIGHT TALK OF THE FIREBRAND AND NOT OF THE
FLAME
THIS MANUSCRIPT OF FIFTEEN PAGES SUDDENLY AND SWEETLY REVEALED
TO HER ALL OF LOVE SORROW DESTINY LIFE ETERNITY THE BEGINNING
THE END
IT WAS AS IF A HAND HAD OPENED AND SUDDENLY FLUNG UPON HER
A HANDFUL OF RAYS OF LIGHT
IN THESE FEW LINES SHE FELT A PASSIONATE
ARDENT GENEROUS HONEST NATURE A SACRED WILL AN IMMENSE SORROW AND
AN IMMENSE DESPAIR A SUFFERING HEART AN ECSTASY FULLY EXPANDED
WHAT
WAS THIS MANUSCRIPT A LETTER
A LETTER WITHOUT NAME WITHOUT ADDRESS
WITHOUT DATE WITHOUT SIGNATURE PRESSING AND DISINTERESTED AN ENIGMA
COMPOSED OF TRUTHS A MESSAGE OF LOVE MADE TO BE BROUGHT BY AN ANGEL AND
READ BY A VIRGIN AN APPOINTMENT MADE BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF EARTH THE
LOVE LETTER OF A PHANTOM TO A SHADE
IT WAS AN ABSENT ONE TRANQUIL AND
DEJECTED WHO SEEMED READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN DEATH AND WHO SENT TO THE
ABSENT LOVE HIS LADY THE SECRET OF FATE THE KEY OF LIFE LOVE
THIS
HAD BEEN WRITTEN WITH ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE AND ONE FINGER IN HEAVEN
THESE LINES WHICH HAD FALLEN ONE BY ONE ON THE PAPER WERE WHAT MIGHT
BE CALLED DROPS OF SOUL
NOW FROM WHOM COULD THESE PAGES COME WHO COULD HAVE PENNED THEM
COSETTE DID NOT HESITATE A MOMENT
ONE MAN ONLY
HE
DAY HAD DAWNED ONCE MORE IN HER SPIRIT ALL HAD REAPPEARED
SHE FELT AN
UNHEARD OF JOY AND A PROFOUND ANGUISH
IT WAS HE HE WHO HAD WRITTEN
HE WAS THERE IT WAS HE WHOSE ARM HAD BEEN THRUST THROUGH THAT RAILING
WHILE SHE WAS FORGETFUL OF HIM HE HAD FOUND HER AGAIN BUT HAD SHE
FORGOTTEN HIM NO NEVER SHE WAS FOOLISH TO HAVE THOUGHT SO FOR A
SINGLE MOMENT
SHE HAD ALWAYS LOVED HIM ALWAYS ADORED HIM
THE FIRE HAD
BEEN SMOTHERED AND HAD SMOULDERED FOR A TIME BUT SHE SAW ALL PLAINLY
NOW IT HAD BUT MADE HEADWAY AND NOW IT HAD BURST FORTH AFRESH AND
HAD INFLAMED HER WHOLE BEING
THIS NOTE BOOK WAS LIKE A SPARK WHICH
HAD FALLEN FROM THAT OTHER SOUL INTO HERS
SHE FELT THE CONFLAGRATION
STARTING UP ONCE MORE
SHE IMBUED HERSELF THOROUGHLY WITH EVERY WORD OF THE MANUSCRIPT OH
YES SAID SHE HOW PERFECTLY I RECOGNIZE ALL THAT THAT IS WHAT I HAD
ALREADY READ IN HIS EYES AS SHE WAS FINISHING IT FOR THE THIRD TIME
LIEUTENANT THEODULE PASSED THE GATE ONCE MORE AND RATTLED HIS SPURS
UPON THE PAVEMENT
COSETTE WAS FORCED TO RAISE HER EYES
SHE THOUGHT HIM
INSIPID SILLY STUPID USELESS FOPPISH DISPLEASING IMPERTINENT AND
EXTREMELY UGLY
THE OFFICER THOUGHT IT HIS DUTY TO SMILE AT HER
SHE TURNED AWAY AS IN SHAME AND INDIGNATION
SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE
THROWN SOMETHING AT HIS HEAD
SHE FLED RE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER CHAMBER TO
PERUSE THE MANUSCRIPT ONCE MORE TO LEARN IT BY HEART AND TO DREAM
WHEN SHE HAD THOROUGHLY MASTERED IT SHE KISSED IT AND PUT IT IN HER
BOSOM
ALL WAS OVER COSETTE HAD FALLEN BACK INTO DEEP SERAPHIC LOVE
THE
ABYSS OF EDEN HAD YAWNED ONCE MORE
ALL DAY LONG COSETTE REMAINED IN A SORT OF BEWILDERMENT
SHE SCARCELY
THOUGHT HER IDEAS WERE IN THE STATE OF A TANGLED SKEIN IN HER BRAIN
SHE COULD NOT MANAGE TO CONJECTURE ANYTHING SHE HOPED THROUGH A TREMOR
WHAT VAGUE THINGS
SHE DARED MAKE HERSELF NO PROMISES AND SHE DID
NOT WISH TO REFUSE HERSELF ANYTHING
FLASHES OF PALLOR PASSED OVER HER
COUNTENANCE AND SHIVERS RAN THROUGH HER FRAME
IT SEEMED TO HER AT
INTERVALS THAT SHE WAS ENTERING THE LAND OF CHIMAERAS SHE SAID TO
HERSELF IS THIS REALITY THEN SHE FELT OF THE DEAR PAPER WITHIN HER
BOSOM UNDER HER GOWN SHE PRESSED IT TO HER HEART SHE FELT ITS ANGLES
AGAINST HER FLESH AND IF JEAN VALJEAN HAD SEEN HER AT THE MOMENT HE
WOULD HAVE SHUDDERED IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT LUMINOUS AND UNKNOWN JOY
WHICH OVERFLOWED FROM BENEATH HER EYELIDS OH YES SHE THOUGHT IT
IS CERTAINLY HE THIS COMES FROM HIM AND IS FOR ME
AND SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT AN INTERVENTION OF THE ANGELS A CELESTIAL
CHANCE HAD GIVEN HIM BACK TO HER
OH TRANSFIGURATION OF LOVE OH DREAMS THAT CELESTIAL CHANCE THAT
INTERVENTION OF THE ANGELS WAS A PELLET OF BREAD TOSSED BY ONE THIEF TO
ANOTHER THIEF FROM THE CHARLEMAGNE COURTYARD TO THE LION'S DITCH OVER
THE ROOFS OF LA FORCE
CHAPTER VI OLD PEOPLE ARE MADE TO GO OUT OPPORTUNELY
WHEN EVENING CAME JEAN VALJEAN WENT OUT COSETTE DRESSED HERSELF
SHE
ARRANGED HER HAIR IN THE MOST BECOMING MANNER AND SHE PUT ON A DRESS
WHOSE BODICE HAD RECEIVED ONE SNIP OF THE SCISSORS TOO MUCH AND WHICH
THROUGH THIS SLOPE PERMITTED A VIEW OF THE BEGINNING OF HER THROAT AND
WAS AS YOUNG GIRLS SAY A TRIFLE INDECENT IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST
INDECENT BUT IT WAS PRETTIER THAN USUAL
SHE MADE HER TOILET THUS
WITHOUT KNOWING WHY SHE DID SO
DID SHE MEAN TO GO OUT NO
WAS SHE EXPECTING A VISITOR NO
AT DUSK SHE WENT DOWN TO THE GARDEN
TOUSSAINT WAS BUSY IN HER KITCHEN
WHICH OPENED ON THE BACK YARD
SHE BEGAN TO STROLL ABOUT UNDER THE TREES THRUSTING ASIDE THE BRANCHES
FROM TIME TO TIME WITH HER HAND BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME WHICH HUNG VERY
LOW
IN THIS MANNER SHE REACHED THE BENCH
THE STONE WAS STILL THERE
SHE SAT DOWN AND GENTLY LAID HER WHITE HAND ON THIS STONE AS THOUGH SHE
WISHED TO CARESS AND THANK IT
ALL AT ONCE SHE EXPERIENCED THAT INDEFINABLE IMPRESSION WHICH ONE
UNDERGOES WHEN THERE IS SOME ONE STANDING BEHIND ONE EVEN WHEN SHE DOES
NOT SEE THE PERSON
SHE TURNED HER HEAD AND ROSE TO HER FEET
IT WAS HE
HIS HEAD WAS BARE
HE APPEARED TO HAVE GROWN THIN AND PALE
HIS BLACK
CLOTHES WERE HARDLY DISCERNIBLE
THE TWILIGHT THREW A WAN LIGHT ON
HIS FINE BROW AND COVERED HIS EYES IN SHADOWS
BENEATH A VEIL OF
INCOMPARABLE SWEETNESS HE HAD SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT SUGGESTED DEATH
AND NIGHT
HIS FACE WAS ILLUMINATED BY THE LIGHT OF THE DYING DAY AND
BY THE THOUGHT OF A SOUL THAT IS TAKING FLIGHT
HE SEEMED TO BE NOT YET A GHOST AND HE WAS NO LONGER A MAN
HE HAD FLUNG AWAY HIS HAT IN THE THICKET A FEW PACES DISTANT
COSETTE THOUGH READY TO SWOON UTTERED NO CRY
SHE RETREATED SLOWLY
FOR SHE FELT HERSELF ATTRACTED
HE DID NOT STIR
BY VIRTUE OF SOMETHING
INEFFABLE AND MELANCHOLY WHICH ENVELOPED HIM SHE FELT THE LOOK IN HIS
EYES WHICH SHE COULD NOT SEE
COSETTE IN HER RETREAT ENCOUNTERED A TREE AND LEANED AGAINST IT
HAD
IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS TREE SHE WOULD HAVE FALLEN
THEN SHE HEARD HIS VOICE THAT VOICE WHICH SHE HAD REALLY NEVER HEARD
BARELY RISING ABOVE THE RUSTLE OF THE LEAVES AND MURMURING
PARDON ME HERE I AM
MY HEART IS FULL
I COULD NOT LIVE ON AS I WAS
LIVING AND I HAVE COME
HAVE YOU READ WHAT I PLACED THERE ON THE BENCH
DO YOU RECOGNIZE ME AT ALL HAVE NO FEAR OF ME
IT IS A LONG TIME YOU
REMEMBER THE DAY SINCE YOU LOOKED AT ME AT THE LUXEMBOURG NEAR THE
GLADIATOR
AND THE DAY WHEN YOU PASSED BEFORE ME IT WAS ON THE 16TH OF
JUNE AND THE 2D OF JULY
IT IS NEARLY A YEAR AGO
I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU
FOR A LONG TIME
I INQUIRED OF THE WOMAN WHO LET THE CHAIRS AND SHE
TOLD ME THAT SHE NO LONGER SAW YOU
YOU LIVED IN THE RUE DE L'OUEST ON
THE THIRD FLOOR IN THE FRONT APARTMENTS OF A NEW HOUSE YOU SEE THAT
I KNOW I FOLLOWED YOU
WHAT ELSE WAS THERE FOR ME TO DO AND THEN YOU
DISAPPEARED
I THOUGHT I SAW YOU PASS ONCE WHILE I WAS READING THE
NEWSPAPERS UNDER THE ARCADE OF THE ODEON
I RAN AFTER YOU
BUT NO
IT
WAS A PERSON WHO HAD A BONNET LIKE YOURS
AT NIGHT I CAME HITHER
DO
NOT BE AFRAID NO ONE SEES ME
I COME TO GAZE UPON YOUR WINDOWS NEAR
AT HAND
I WALK VERY SOFTLY SO THAT YOU MAY NOT HEAR FOR YOU MIGHT BE
ALARMED
THE OTHER EVENING I WAS BEHIND YOU YOU TURNED ROUND I FLED
ONCE I HEARD YOU SINGING
I WAS HAPPY
DID IT AFFECT YOU BECAUSE I
HEARD YOU SINGING THROUGH THE SHUTTERS THAT COULD NOT HURT YOU
NO
IT IS NOT SO YOU SEE YOU ARE MY ANGEL LET ME COME SOMETIMES I THINK
THAT I AM GOING TO DIE
IF YOU ONLY KNEW I ADORE YOU
FORGIVE ME I
SPEAK TO YOU BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING I MAY HAVE DISPLEASED
YOU HAVE I DISPLEASED YOU
OH MY MOTHER SAID SHE
AND SHE SANK DOWN AS THOUGH ON THE POINT OF DEATH
HE GRASPED HER SHE FELL HE TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS HE PRESSED HER CLOSE
WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS DOING
HE SUPPORTED HER THOUGH HE WAS
TOTTERING HIMSELF
IT WAS AS THOUGH HIS BRAIN WERE FULL OF SMOKE
LIGHTNINGS DARTED BETWEEN HIS LIPS HIS IDEAS VANISHED IT SEEMED TO HIM
THAT HE WAS ACCOMPLISHING SOME RELIGIOUS ACT AND THAT HE WAS COMMITTING
A PROFANATION
MOREOVER HE HAD NOT THE LEAST PASSION FOR THIS LOVELY
WOMAN WHOSE FORCE HE FELT AGAINST HIS BREAST
HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH
LOVE
SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND LAID IT ON HER HEART
HE FELT THE PAPER THERE HE
STAMMERED
YOU LOVE ME THEN
SHE REPLIED IN A VOICE SO LOW THAT IT WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE THAN A
BARELY AUDIBLE BREATH
HUSH THOU KNOWEST IT
AND SHE HID HER BLUSHING FACE ON THE BREAST OF THE SUPERB AND
INTOXICATED YOUNG MAN
HE FELL UPON THE BENCH AND SHE BESIDE HIM
THEY HAD NO WORDS MORE
THE
STARS WERE BEGINNING TO GLEAM
HOW DID IT COME TO PASS THAT THEIR LIPS
MET HOW COMES IT TO PASS THAT THE BIRDS SING THAT SNOW MELTS THAT
THE ROSE UNFOLDS THAT MAY EXPANDS THAT THE DAWN GROWS WHITE BEHIND THE
BLACK TREES ON THE SHIVERING CREST OF THE HILLS
A KISS AND THAT WAS ALL
BOTH STARTED AND GAZED INTO THE DARKNESS WITH SPARKLING EYES
THEY FELT NEITHER THE COOL NIGHT NOR THE COLD STONE NOR THE DAMP
EARTH NOR THE WET GRASS THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THEIR HEARTS
WERE FULL OF THOUGHTS
THEY HAD CLASPED HANDS UNCONSCIOUSLY
SHE DID NOT ASK HIM SHE DID NOT EVEN WONDER HOW HE HAD ENTERED THERE
AND HOW HE HAD MADE HIS WAY INTO THE GARDEN
IT SEEMED SO SIMPLE TO HER
THAT HE SHOULD BE THERE
FROM TIME TO TIME MARIUS' KNEE TOUCHED COSETTE'S KNEE AND BOTH
SHIVERED
AT INTERVALS COSETTE STAMMERED A WORD
HER SOUL FLUTTERED ON HER LIPS
LIKE A DROP OF DEW ON A FLOWER
LITTLE BY LITTLE THEY BEGAN TO TALK TO EACH OTHER
EFFUSION FOLLOWED
SILENCE WHICH IS FULNESS
THE NIGHT WAS SERENE AND SPLENDID OVERHEAD
THESE TWO BEINGS PURE AS SPIRITS TOLD EACH OTHER EVERYTHING THEIR
DREAMS THEIR INTOXICATIONS THEIR ECSTASIES THEIR CHIMAERAS THEIR
WEAKNESSES HOW THEY HAD ADORED EACH OTHER FROM AFAR HOW THEY HAD
LONGED FOR EACH OTHER THEIR DESPAIR WHEN THEY HAD CEASED TO SEE EACH
OTHER
THEY CONFIDED TO EACH OTHER IN AN IDEAL INTIMACY WHICH NOTHING
COULD AUGMENT THEIR MOST SECRET AND MOST MYSTERIOUS THOUGHTS
THEY
RELATED TO EACH OTHER WITH CANDID FAITH IN THEIR ILLUSIONS ALL THAT
LOVE YOUTH AND THE REMAINS OF CHILDHOOD WHICH STILL LINGERED ABOUT
THEM SUGGESTED TO THEIR MINDS
THEIR TWO HEARTS POURED THEMSELVES OUT
INTO EACH OTHER IN SUCH WISE THAT AT THE EXPIRATION OF A QUARTER OF AN
HOUR IT WAS THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD THE YOUNG GIRL'S SOUL AND THE YOUNG
GIRL WHO HAD THE YOUNG MAN'S SOUL
EACH BECAME PERMEATED WITH THE OTHER
THEY WERE ENCHANTED WITH EACH OTHER THEY DAZZLED EACH OTHER
WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED WHEN THEY HAD TOLD EACH OTHER EVERYTHING SHE
LAID HER HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER AND ASKED HIM
WHAT IS YOUR NAME
MY NAME IS MARIUS SAID HE
AND YOURS
MY NAME IS COSETTE
BOOK SIXTH LITTLE GAVROCHE
CHAPTER I THE MALICIOUS PLAYFULNESS OF THE WIND
SINCE 1823 WHEN THE TAVERN OF MONTFERMEIL WAS ON THE WAY TO SHIPWRECK
AND WAS BEING GRADUALLY ENGULFED NOT IN THE ABYSS OF A BANKRUPTCY BUT
IN THE CESSPOOL OF PETTY DEBTS THE THENARDIER PAIR HAD HAD TWO OTHER
CHILDREN BOTH MALES
THAT MADE FIVE TWO GIRLS AND THREE BOYS
MADAME THENARDIER HAD GOT RID OF THE LAST TWO WHILE THEY WERE STILL
YOUNG AND VERY SMALL WITH REMARKABLE LUCK
GOT RID OF IS THE WORD
THERE WAS BUT A MERE FRAGMENT OF NATURE IN THAT
WOMAN
A PHENOMENON BY THE WAY OF WHICH THERE IS MORE THAN ONE EXAMPLE
EXTANT
LIKE THE MARECHALE DE LA MOTHE HOUDANCOURT THE THENARDIER WAS
A MOTHER TO HER DAUGHTERS ONLY
THERE HER MATERNITY ENDED
HER HATRED OF
THE HUMAN RACE BEGAN WITH HER OWN SONS
IN THE DIRECTION OF HER SONS HER
EVIL DISPOSITION WAS UNCOMPROMISING AND HER HEART HAD A LUGUBRIOUS WALL
IN THAT QUARTER
AS THE READER HAS SEEN SHE DETESTED THE ELDEST SHE
CURSED THE OTHER TWO
WHY BECAUSE
THE MOST TERRIBLE OF MOTIVES THE
MOST UNANSWERABLE OF RETORTS BECAUSE
I HAVE NO NEED OF A LITTER OF
SQUALLING BRATS SAID THIS MOTHER
LET US EXPLAIN HOW THE THENARDIERS HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RID OF THEIR
LAST TWO CHILDREN AND EVEN IN DRAWING PROFIT FROM THE OPERATION
THE WOMAN MAGNON WHO WAS MENTIONED A FEW PAGES FURTHER BACK WAS THE
SAME ONE WHO HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING OLD GILLENORMAND SUPPORT THE TWO
CHILDREN WHICH SHE HAD HAD
SHE LIVED ON THE QUAI DES CELESTINS AT THE
CORNER OF THIS ANCIENT STREET OF THE PETIT MUSC WHICH AFFORDED HER THE
OPPORTUNITY OF CHANGING HER EVIL REPUTE INTO GOOD ODOR
THE READER WILL
REMEMBER THE GREAT EPIDEMIC OF CROUP WHICH RAVAGED THE RIVER DISTRICTS
OF THE SEINE IN PARIS THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND OF WHICH SCIENCE TOOK
ADVANTAGE TO MAKE EXPERIMENTS ON A GRAND SCALE AS TO THE EFFICACY OF
INHALATIONS OF ALUM SO BENEFICIALLY REPLACED AT THE PRESENT DAY BY THE
EXTERNAL TINCTURE OF IODINE
DURING THIS EPIDEMIC THE MAGNON LOST BOTH
HER BOYS WHO WERE STILL VERY YOUNG ONE IN THE MORNING THE OTHER
IN THE EVENING OF THE SAME DAY
THIS WAS A BLOW
THESE CHILDREN WERE
PRECIOUS TO THEIR MOTHER THEY REPRESENTED EIGHTY FRANCS A MONTH
THESE
EIGHTY FRANCS WERE PUNCTUALLY PAID IN THE NAME OF M
GILLENORMAND BY
COLLECTOR OF HIS RENTS M
BARGE A RETIRED TIP STAFF IN THE RUE DU
ROI DE SICILE
THE CHILDREN DEAD THE INCOME WAS AT AN END
THE MAGNON
SOUGHT AN EXPEDIENT
IN THAT DARK FREE MASONRY OF EVIL OF WHICH SHE
FORMED A PART EVERYTHING IS KNOWN ALL SECRETS ARE KEPT AND ALL LEND
MUTUAL AID
MAGNON NEEDED TWO CHILDREN THE THENARDIERS HAD TWO
THE SAME SEX THE SAME AGE
A GOOD ARRANGEMENT FOR THE ONE A GOOD
INVESTMENT FOR THE OTHER
THE LITTLE THENARDIERS BECAME LITTLE MAGNONS
MAGNON QUITTED THE QUAI DES CELESTINS AND WENT TO LIVE IN THE RUE
CLOCHEPERCE
IN PARIS THE IDENTITY WHICH BINDS AN INDIVIDUAL TO HIMSELF
IS BROKEN BETWEEN ONE STREET AND ANOTHER
THE REGISTRY OFFICE BEING IN NO WAY WARNED RAISED NO OBJECTIONS AND
THE SUBSTITUTION WAS EFFECTED IN THE MOST SIMPLE MANNER IN THE WORLD
ONLY THE THENARDIER EXACTED FOR THIS LOAN OF HER CHILDREN TEN FRANCS A
MONTH WHICH MAGNON PROMISED TO PAY AND WHICH SHE ACTUALLY DID PAY
IT IS UNNECESSARY TO ADD THAT M
GILLENORMAND CONTINUED TO PERFORM
HIS COMPACT
HE CAME TO SEE THE CHILDREN EVERY SIX MONTHS
HE DID NOT
PERCEIVE THE CHANGE
MONSIEUR MAGNON SAID TO HIM HOW MUCH THEY
RESEMBLE YOU
THENARDIER TO WHOM AVATARS WERE EASY SEIZED THIS OCCASION TO BECOME
JONDRETTE
HIS TWO DAUGHTERS AND GAVROCHE HAD HARDLY HAD TIME TO
DISCOVER THAT THEY HAD TWO LITTLE BROTHERS
WHEN A CERTAIN DEGREE
OF MISERY IS REACHED ONE IS OVERPOWERED WITH A SORT OF SPECTRAL
INDIFFERENCE AND ONE REGARDS HUMAN BEINGS AS THOUGH THEY WERE SPECTRES
YOUR NEAREST RELATIONS ARE OFTEN NO MORE FOR YOU THAN VAGUE SHADOWY
FORMS BARELY OUTLINED AGAINST A NEBULOUS BACKGROUND OF LIFE AND EASILY
CONFOUNDED AGAIN WITH THE INVISIBLE
ON THE EVENING OF THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD HANDED OVER HER TWO LITTLE
ONES TO MAGNON WITH EXPRESS INTENTION OF RENOUNCING THEM FOREVER THE
THENARDIER HAD FELT OR HAD APPEARED TO FEEL A SCRUPLE
SHE SAID TO HER
HUSBAND BUT THIS IS ABANDONING OUR CHILDREN THENARDIER MASTERFUL
AND PHLEGMATIC CAUTERIZED THE SCRUPLE WITH THIS SAYING JEAN JACQUES
ROUSSEAU DID EVEN BETTER FROM SCRUPLES THE MOTHER PROCEEDED TO
UNEASINESS BUT WHAT IF THE POLICE WERE TO ANNOY US TELL ME MONSIEUR
THENARDIER IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE PERMISSIBLE THENARDIER REPLIED
EVERYTHING IS PERMISSIBLE
NO ONE WILL SEE ANYTHING BUT TRUE BLUE IN
IT
BESIDES NO ONE HAS ANY INTEREST IN LOOKING CLOSELY AFTER CHILDREN
WHO HAVE NOT A SOU
MAGNON WAS A SORT OF FASHIONABLE WOMAN IN THE SPHERE OF CRIME
SHE WAS
CAREFUL ABOUT HER TOILET
SHE SHARED HER LODGINGS WHICH WERE FURNISHED
IN AN AFFECTED AND WRETCHED STYLE WITH A CLEVER GALLICIZED ENGLISH
THIEF
THIS ENGLISH WOMAN WHO HAD BECOME A NATURALIZED PARISIENNE
RECOMMENDED BY VERY WEALTHY RELATIONS INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE
MEDALS IN THE LIBRARY AND MADEMOISELLE MAR'S DIAMONDS BECAME CELEBRATED
LATER ON IN JUDICIAL ACCOUNTS
SHE WAS CALLED MAMSELLE MISS
THE TWO LITTLE CREATURES WHO HAD FALLEN TO MAGNON HAD NO REASON TO
COMPLAIN OF THEIR LOT
RECOMMENDED BY THE EIGHTY FRANCS THEY WERE WELL
CARED FOR AS IS EVERYTHING FROM WHICH PROFIT IS DERIVED THEY WERE
NEITHER BADLY CLOTHED NOR BADLY FED THEY WERE TREATED ALMOST LIKE
LITTLE GENTLEMEN BETTER BY THEIR FALSE MOTHER THAN BY THEIR REAL
ONE
MAGNON PLAYED THE LADY AND TALKED NO THIEVES' SLANG IN THEIR
PRESENCE
THUS PASSED SEVERAL YEARS
THENARDIER AUGURED WELL FROM THE FACT
ONE
DAY HE CHANCED TO SAY TO MAGNON AS SHE HANDED HIM HIS MONTHLY STIPEND
OF TEN FRANCS THE FATHER MUST GIVE THEM SOME EDUCATION
ALL AT ONCE THESE TWO POOR CHILDREN WHO HAD UP TO THAT TIME BEEN
PROTECTED TOLERABLY WELL EVEN BY THEIR EVIL FATE WERE ABRUPTLY HURLED
INTO LIFE AND FORCED TO BEGIN IT FOR THEMSELVES
A WHOLESALE ARREST OF MALEFACTORS LIKE THAT IN THE JONDRETTE GARRET
NECESSARILY COMPLICATED BY INVESTIGATIONS AND SUBSEQUENT INCARCERATIONS
IS A VERITABLE DISASTER FOR THAT HIDEOUS AND OCCULT COUNTER SOCIETY
WHICH PURSUES ITS EXISTENCE BENEATH PUBLIC SOCIETY AN ADVENTURE OF THIS
DESCRIPTION ENTAILS ALL SORTS OF CATASTROPHES IN THAT SOMBRE WORLD
THE
THENARDIER CATASTROPHE INVOLVED THE CATASTROPHE OF MAGNON
ONE DAY A SHORT TIME AFTER MAGNON HAD HANDED TO EPONINE THE NOTE
RELATING TO THE RUE PLUMET A SUDDEN RAID WAS MADE BY THE POLICE IN THE
RUE CLOCHEPERCE MAGNON WAS SEIZED AS WAS ALSO MAMSELLE MISS AND ALL
THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS OF A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER WERE
GATHERED INTO THE NET
WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON THE TWO LITTLE BOYS WERE
PLAYING IN THE BACK YARD AND SAW NOTHING OF THE RAID
WHEN THEY TRIED
TO ENTER THE HOUSE AGAIN THEY FOUND THE DOOR FASTENED AND THE HOUSE
EMPTY
A COBBLER OPPOSITE CALLED THEM TO HIM AND DELIVERED TO THEM A
PAPER WHICH THEIR MOTHER HAD LEFT FOR THEM
ON THIS PAPER THERE WAS AN
ADDRESS M
BARGE COLLECTOR OF RENTS RUE DU ROI DE SICILE NO
8
THE
PROPRIETOR OF THE STALL SAID TO THEM YOU CANNOT LIVE HERE ANY LONGER
GO THERE
IT IS NEAR BY
THE FIRST STREET ON THE LEFT
ASK YOUR WAY FROM
THIS PAPER
THE CHILDREN SET OUT THE ELDER LEADING THE YOUNGER AND HOLDING IN HIS
HAND THE PAPER WHICH WAS TO GUIDE THEM
IT WAS COLD AND HIS BENUMBED
LITTLE FINGERS COULD NOT CLOSE VERY FIRMLY AND THEY DID NOT KEEP A VERY
GOOD HOLD ON THE PAPER
AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE CLOCHEPERCE A GUST OF
WIND TORE IT FROM HIM AND AS NIGHT WAS FALLING THE CHILD WAS NOT ABLE
TO FIND IT AGAIN
THEY BEGAN TO WANDER AIMLESSLY THROUGH THE STREETS
CHAPTER II IN WHICH LITTLE GAVROCHE EXTRACTS PROFIT FROM NAPOLEON THE
GREAT
SPRING IN PARIS IS OFTEN TRAVERSED BY HARSH AND PIERCING BREEZES WHICH
DO NOT PRECISELY CHILL BUT FREEZE ONE THESE NORTH WINDS WHICH SADDEN
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DAYS PRODUCE EXACTLY THE EFFECT OF THOSE PUFFS OF
COLD AIR WHICH ENTER A WARM ROOM THROUGH THE CRACKS OF A BADLY FITTING
DOOR OR WINDOW
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE GLOOMY DOOR OF WINTER HAD
REMAINED AJAR AND AS THOUGH THE WIND WERE POURING THROUGH IT
IN THE
SPRING OF 1832 THE EPOCH WHEN THE FIRST GREAT EPIDEMIC OF THIS CENTURY
BROKE OUT IN EUROPE THESE NORTH GALES WERE MORE HARSH AND PIERCING
THAN EVER
IT WAS A DOOR EVEN MORE GLACIAL THAN THAT OF WINTER WHICH
WAS AJAR
IT WAS THE DOOR OF THE SEPULCHRE
IN THESE WINDS ONE FELT THE
BREATH OF THE CHOLERA
FROM A METEOROLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW THESE COLD WINDS POSSESSED THIS
PECULIARITY THAT THEY DID NOT PRECLUDE A STRONG ELECTRIC TENSION
FREQUENT STORMS ACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER AND LIGHTNING BURST FORTH AT
THIS EPOCH
ONE EVENING WHEN THESE GALES WERE BLOWING RUDELY TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT
JANUARY SEEMED TO HAVE RETURNED AND THAT THE BOURGEOIS HAD RESUMED THEIR
CLOAKS LITTLE GAVROCHE WHO WAS ALWAYS SHIVERING GAYLY UNDER HIS RAGS
WAS STANDING AS THOUGH IN ECSTASY BEFORE A WIG MAKER'S SHOP IN THE
VICINITY OF THE ORME SAINT GERVAIS
HE WAS ADORNED WITH A WOMAN'S
WOOLLEN SHAWL PICKED UP NO ONE KNOWS WHERE AND WHICH HE HAD CONVERTED
INTO A NECK COMFORTER
LITTLE GAVROCHE APPEARED TO BE ENGAGED IN INTENT
ADMIRATION OF A WAX BRIDE IN A LOW NECKED DRESS AND CROWNED WITH
ORANGE FLOWERS WHO WAS REVOLVING IN THE WINDOW AND DISPLAYING HER
SMILE TO PASSERS BY BETWEEN TWO ARGAND LAMPS BUT IN REALITY HE WAS
TAKING AN OBSERVATION OF THE SHOP IN ORDER TO DISCOVER WHETHER HE
COULD NOT PRIG FROM THE SHOP FRONT A CAKE OF SOAP WHICH HE WOULD THEN
PROCEED TO SELL FOR A SOU TO A HAIR DRESSER IN THE SUBURBS
HE HAD
OFTEN MANAGED TO BREAKFAST OFF OF SUCH A ROLL
HE CALLED HIS SPECIES OF
WORK FOR WHICH HE POSSESSED SPECIAL APTITUDE SHAVING BARBERS
WHILE CONTEMPLATING THE BRIDE AND EYEING THE CAKE OF SOAP HE MUTTERED
BETWEEN HIS TEETH TUESDAY
IT WAS NOT TUESDAY
WAS IT TUESDAY PERHAPS
IT WAS TUESDAY
YES IT WAS TUESDAY
NO ONE HAS EVER DISCOVERED TO WHAT THIS MONOLOGUE REFERRED
YES PERCHANCE THIS MONOLOGUE HAD SOME CONNECTION WITH THE LAST
OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAD DINED THREE DAYS BEFORE FOR IT WAS NOW
FRIDAY
THE BARBER IN HIS SHOP WHICH WAS WARMED BY A GOOD STOVE WAS SHAVING
A CUSTOMER AND CASTING A GLANCE FROM TIME TO TIME AT THE ENEMY THAT
FREEZING AND IMPUDENT STREET URCHIN BOTH OF WHOSE HANDS WERE IN HIS
POCKETS BUT WHOSE MIND WAS EVIDENTLY UNSHEATHED
WHILE GAVROCHE WAS SCRUTINIZING THE SHOP WINDOW AND THE CAKES OF WINDSOR
SOAP TWO CHILDREN OF UNEQUAL STATURE VERY NEATLY DRESSED AND STILL
SMALLER THAN HIMSELF ONE APPARENTLY ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OF AGE THE OTHER
FIVE TIMIDLY TURNED THE HANDLE AND ENTERED THE SHOP WITH A REQUEST FOR
SOMETHING OR OTHER ALMS POSSIBLY IN A PLAINTIVE MURMUR WHICH RESEMBLED
A GROAN RATHER THAN A PRAYER
THEY BOTH SPOKE AT ONCE AND THEIR WORDS
WERE UNINTELLIGIBLE BECAUSE SOBS BROKE THE VOICE OF THE YOUNGER AND THE
TEETH OF THE ELDER WERE CHATTERING WITH COLD
THE BARBER WHEELED ROUND
WITH A FURIOUS LOOK AND WITHOUT ABANDONING HIS RAZOR THRUST BACK THE
ELDER WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND THE YOUNGER WITH HIS KNEE AND SLAMMED
HIS DOOR SAYING THE IDEA OF COMING IN AND FREEZING EVERYBODY FOR
NOTHING
THE TWO CHILDREN RESUMED THEIR MARCH IN TEARS
IN THE MEANTIME A CLOUD
HAD RISEN IT HAD BEGUN TO RAIN
LITTLE GAVROCHE RAN AFTER THEM AND ACCOSTED THEM
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU BRATS
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE TO SLEEP REPLIED THE ELDER
IS THAT ALL SAID GAVROCHE
A GREAT MATTER TRULY
THE IDEA OF
BAWLING ABOUT THAT
THEY MUST BE GREENIES
AND ADOPTING IN ADDITION TO HIS SUPERIORITY WHICH WAS RATHER
BANTERING AN ACCENT OF TENDER AUTHORITY AND GENTLE PATRONAGE
COME ALONG WITH ME YOUNG 'UNS
YES SIR SAID THE ELDER
AND THE TWO CHILDREN FOLLOWED HIM AS THEY WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED AN
ARCHBISHOP
THEY HAD STOPPED CRYING
GAVROCHE LED THEM UP THE RUE SAINT ANTOINE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
BASTILLE
AS GAVROCHE WALKED ALONG HE CAST AN INDIGNANT BACKWARD GLANCE AT THE
BARBER'S SHOP
THAT FELLOW HAS NO HEART THE WHITING 35 HE MUTTERED
HE'S AN
ENGLISHMAN
A WOMAN WHO CAUGHT SIGHT OF THESE THREE MARCHING IN A FILE WITH
GAVROCHE AT THEIR HEAD BURST INTO NOISY LAUGHTER
THIS LAUGH WAS
WANTING IN RESPECT TOWARDS THE GROUP
GOOD DAY MAMSELLE OMNIBUS SAID GAVROCHE TO HER
AN INSTANT LATER THE WIG MAKER OCCURRED TO HIS MIND ONCE MORE AND HE
ADDED
I AM MAKING A MISTAKE IN THE BEAST HE'S NOT A WHITING HE'S A SERPENT
BARBER I'LL GO AND FETCH A LOCKSMITH AND I'LL HAVE A BELL HUNG TO YOUR
TAIL
THIS WIG MAKER HAD RENDERED HIM AGGRESSIVE
AS HE STRODE OVER A GUTTER
HE APOSTROPHIZED A BEARDED PORTRESS WHO WAS WORTHY TO MEET FAUST ON THE
BROCKEN AND WHO HAD A BROOM IN HER HAND
MADAM SAID HE SO YOU ARE GOING OUT WITH YOUR HORSE
AND THEREUPON HE SPATTERED THE POLISHED BOOTS OF A PEDESTRIAN
YOU SCAMP SHOUTED THE FURIOUS PEDESTRIAN
GAVROCHE ELEVATED HIS NOSE ABOVE HIS SHAWL
IS MONSIEUR COMPLAINING
OF YOU EJACULATED THE MAN
THE OFFICE IS CLOSED SAID GAVROCHE I DO NOT RECEIVE ANY MORE
COMPLAINTS
IN THE MEANWHILE AS HE WENT ON UP THE STREET HE PERCEIVED A
BEGGAR GIRL THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND CLAD IN SO SHORT A
GOWN THAT HER KNEES WERE VISIBLE LYING THOROUGHLY CHILLED UNDER A
PORTE COCHERE
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS GETTING TO BE TOO OLD FOR SUCH A
THING
GROWTH DOES PLAY THESE TRICKS
THE PETTICOAT BECOMES SHORT AT THE
MOMENT WHEN NUDITY BECOMES INDECENT
POOR GIRL SAID GAVROCHE
SHE HASN'T EVEN TROUSERS
HOLD ON TAKE
THIS
AND UNWINDING ALL THE COMFORTABLE WOOLLEN WHICH HE HAD AROUND HIS NECK
HE FLUNG IT ON THE THIN AND PURPLE SHOULDERS OF THE BEGGAR GIRL WHERE
THE SCARF BECAME A SHAWL ONCE MORE
THE CHILD STARED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT AND RECEIVED THE SHAWL IN
SILENCE
WHEN A CERTAIN STAGE OF DISTRESS HAS BEEN REACHED IN HIS
MISERY THE POOR MAN NO LONGER GROANS OVER EVIL NO LONGER RETURNS
THANKS FOR GOOD
THAT DONE BRRR SAID GAVROCHE WHO WAS SHIVERING MORE THAN SAINT
MARTIN FOR THE LATTER RETAINED ONE HALF OF HIS CLOAK
AT THIS BRRR THE DOWNPOUR OF RAIN REDOUBLED IN ITS SPITE BECAME
FURIOUS
THE WICKED SKIES PUNISH GOOD DEEDS
AH COME NOW EXCLAIMED GAVROCHE WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS IT'S
RE RAINING GOOD HEAVENS IF IT GOES ON LIKE THIS I SHALL STOP MY
SUBSCRIPTION
AND HE SET OUT ON THE MARCH ONCE MORE
IT'S ALL RIGHT HE RESUMED CASTING A GLANCE AT THE BEGGAR GIRL AS
SHE COILED UP UNDER THE SHAWL SHE'S GOT A FAMOUS PEEL
AND LOOKING UP AT THE CLOUDS HE EXCLAIMED
CAUGHT
THE TWO CHILDREN FOLLOWED CLOSE ON HIS HEELS
AS THEY WERE PASSING ONE OF THESE HEAVY GRATED LATTICES WHICH INDICATE
A BAKER'S SHOP FOR BREAD IS PUT BEHIND BARS LIKE GOLD GAVROCHE TURNED
ROUND
AH BY THE WAY BRATS HAVE WE DINED
MONSIEUR REPLIED THE ELDER WE HAVE HAD NOTHING TO EAT SINCE THIS
MORNING
SO YOU HAVE NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER RESUMED GAVROCHE MAJESTICALLY
EXCUSE US SIR WE HAVE A PAPA AND A MAMMA BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE
THEY ARE
SOMETIMES THAT'S BETTER THAN KNOWING WHERE THEY ARE SAID GAVROCHE
WHO WAS A THINKER
WE HAVE BEEN WANDERING ABOUT THESE TWO HOURS CONTINUED THE ELDER WE
HAVE HUNTED FOR THINGS AT THE CORNERS OF THE STREETS BUT WE HAVE FOUND
NOTHING
I KNOW EJACULATED GAVROCHE IT'S THE DOGS WHO EAT EVERYTHING
HE WENT ON AFTER A PAUSE
AH WE HAVE LOST OUR AUTHORS
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH
THEM
THIS SHOULD NOT BE GAMINS
IT'S STUPID TO LET OLD PEOPLE STRAY
OFF LIKE THAT
COME NOW WE MUST HAVE A SNOOZE ALL THE SAME
HOWEVER HE ASKED THEM NO QUESTIONS
WHAT WAS MORE SIMPLE THAN THAT THEY
SHOULD HAVE NO DWELLING PLACE
THE ELDER OF THE TWO CHILDREN WHO HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY RECOVERED THE
PROMPT HEEDLESSNESS OF CHILDHOOD UTTERED THIS EXCLAMATION
IT'S QUEER ALL THE SAME
MAMMA TOLD US THAT SHE WOULD TAKE US TO GET A
BLESSED SPRAY ON PALM SUNDAY
BOSH SAID GAVROCHE
MAMMA RESUMED THE ELDER IS A LADY WHO LIVES WITH MAMSELLE MISS
TANFLUTE RETORTED GAVROCHE
MEANWHILE HE HAD HALTED AND FOR THE LAST TWO MINUTES HE HAD BEEN
FEELING AND FUMBLING IN ALL SORTS OF NOOKS WHICH HIS RAGS CONTAINED
AT LAST HE TOSSED HIS HEAD WITH AN AIR INTENDED TO BE MERELY SATISFIED
BUT WHICH WAS TRIUMPHANT IN REALITY
LET US BE CALM YOUNG 'UNS
HERE'S SUPPER FOR THREE
AND FROM ONE OF HIS POCKETS HE DREW FORTH A SOU
WITHOUT ALLOWING THE TWO URCHINS TIME FOR AMAZEMENT HE PUSHED BOTH OF
THEM BEFORE HIM INTO THE BAKER'S SHOP AND FLUNG HIS SOU ON THE COUNTER
CRYING
BOY FIVE CENTIMES' WORTH OF BREAD
THE BAKER WHO WAS THE PROPRIETOR IN PERSON TOOK UP A LOAF AND A KNIFE
IN THREE PIECES MY BOY WENT ON GAVROCHE
AND HE ADDED WITH DIGNITY
THERE ARE THREE OF US
AND SEEING THAT THE BAKER AFTER SCRUTINIZING THE THREE CUSTOMERS HAD
TAKEN DOWN A BLACK LOAF HE THRUST HIS FINGER FAR UP HIS NOSE WITH
AN INHALATION AS IMPERIOUS AS THOUGH HE HAD HAD A PINCH OF THE GREAT
FREDERICK'S SNUFF ON THE TIP OF HIS THUMB AND HURLED THIS INDIGNANT
APOSTROPHE FULL IN THE BAKER'S FACE
KEKSEKCA
THOSE OF OUR READERS WHO MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO ESPY IN THIS INTERPELLATION
OF GAVROCHE'S TO THE BAKER A RUSSIAN OR A POLISH WORD OR ONE OF THOSE
SAVAGE CRIES WHICH THE YOWAYS AND THE BOTOCUDOS HURL AT EACH OTHER FROM
BANK TO BANK OF A RIVER ATHWART THE SOLITUDES ARE WARNED THAT IT IS A
WORD WHICH THEY OUR READERS UTTER EVERY DAY AND WHICH TAKES THE PLACE
OF THE PHRASE QU'EST CE QUE C'EST QUE CELA THE BAKER UNDERSTOOD
PERFECTLY AND REPLIED
WELL IT'S BREAD AND VERY GOOD BREAD OF THE SECOND QUALITY
YOU MEAN LARTON BRUTAL BLACK BREAD RETORTED GAVROCHE CALMLY AND
COLDLY DISDAINFUL
WHITE BREAD BOY WHITE BREAD LARTON SAVONNE I'M
STANDING TREAT
THE BAKER COULD NOT REPRESS A SMILE AND AS HE CUT THE WHITE BREAD HE
SURVEYED THEM IN A COMPASSIONATE WAY WHICH SHOCKED GAVROCHE
COME NOW BAKER'S BOY SAID HE WHAT ARE YOU TAKING OUR MEASURE LIKE
THAT FOR
ALL THREE OF THEM PLACED END TO END WOULD HAVE HARDLY MADE A MEASURE
WHEN THE BREAD WAS CUT THE BAKER THREW THE SOU INTO HIS DRAWER AND
GAVROCHE SAID TO THE TWO CHILDREN
GRUB AWAY
THE LITTLE BOYS STARED AT HIM IN SURPRISE
GAVROCHE BEGAN TO LAUGH
AH HULLO THAT'S SO THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND YET THEY'RE TOO SMALL
AND HE REPEATED
EAT AWAY
AT THE SAME TIME HE HELD OUT A PIECE OF BREAD TO EACH OF THEM
AND THINKING THAT THE ELDER WHO SEEMED TO HIM THE MORE WORTHY OF
HIS CONVERSATION DESERVED SOME SPECIAL ENCOURAGEMENT AND OUGHT TO BE
RELIEVED FROM ALL HESITATION TO SATISFY HIS APPETITE HE ADDED AS BE
HANDED HIM THE LARGEST SHARE
RAM THAT INTO YOUR MUZZLE
ONE PIECE WAS SMALLER THAN THE OTHERS HE KEPT THIS FOR HIMSELF
THE POOR CHILDREN INCLUDING GAVROCHE WERE FAMISHED
AS THEY TORE THEIR
BREAD APART IN BIG MOUTHFULS THEY BLOCKED UP THE SHOP OF THE BAKER
WHO NOW THAT THEY HAD PAID THEIR MONEY LOOKED ANGRILY AT THEM
LET'S GO INTO THE STREET AGAIN SAID GAVROCHE
THEY SET OFF ONCE MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BASTILLE
FROM TIME TO TIME AS THEY PASSED THE LIGHTED SHOP WINDOWS THE SMALLEST
HALTED TO LOOK AT THE TIME ON A LEADEN WATCH WHICH WAS SUSPENDED FROM
HIS NECK BY A CORD
WELL HE IS A VERY GREEN 'UN SAID GAVROCHE
THEN BECOMING THOUGHTFUL HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
ALL THE SAME IF I HAD CHARGE OF THE BABES I'D LOCK 'EM UP BETTER THAN
THAT
JUST AS THEY WERE FINISHING THEIR MORSEL OF BREAD AND HAD REACHED THE
ANGLE OF THAT GLOOMY RUE DES BALLETS AT THE OTHER END OF WHICH THE LOW
AND THREATENING WICKET OF LA FORCE WAS VISIBLE
HULLO IS THAT YOU GAVROCHE SAID SOME ONE
HULLO IS THAT YOU MONTPARNASSE SAID GAVROCHE
A MAN HAD JUST ACCOSTED THE STREET URCHIN AND THE MAN WAS NO OTHER
THAN MONTPARNASSE IN DISGUISE WITH BLUE SPECTACLES BUT RECOGNIZABLE TO
GAVROCHE
THE BOW WOWS WENT ON GAVROCHE YOU'VE GOT A HIDE THE COLOR OF A
LINSEED PLASTER AND BLUE SPECS LIKE A DOCTOR
YOU'RE PUTTING ON STYLE
'PON MY WORD
HUSH EJACULATED MONTPARNASSE NOT SO LOUD
AND HE DREW GAVROCHE HASTILY OUT OF RANGE OF THE LIGHTED SHOPS
THE TWO LITTLE ONES FOLLOWED MECHANICALLY HOLDING EACH OTHER BY THE
HAND
WHEN THEY WERE ENSCONCED UNDER THE ARCH OF A PORTECOCHERE SHELTERED
FROM THE RAIN AND FROM ALL EYES
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I'M GOING DEMANDED MONTPARNASSE
TO THE ABBEY OF ASCEND WITH REGRET 36 REPLIED GAVROCHE
JOKER
AND MONTPARNASSE WENT ON
I'M GOING TO FIND BABET
AH EXCLAIMED GAVROCHE SO HER NAME IS BABET
MONTPARNASSE LOWERED HIS VOICE
NOT SHE HE
AH BABET
YES BABET
I THOUGHT HE WAS BUCKLED
HE HAS UNDONE THE BUCKLE REPLIED MONTPARNASSE
AND HE RAPIDLY RELATED TO THE GAMIN HOW ON THE MORNING OF THAT VERY
DAY BABET HAVING BEEN TRANSFERRED TO LA CONCIERGERIE HAD MADE HIS
ESCAPE BY TURNING TO THE LEFT INSTEAD OF TO THE RIGHT IN THE POLICE
OFFICE
GAVROCHE EXPRESSED HIS ADMIRATION FOR THIS SKILL
WHAT A DENTIST HE CRIED
MONTPARNASSE ADDED A FEW DETAILS AS TO BABET'S FLIGHT AND ENDED WITH
OH THAT'S NOT ALL
GAVROCHE AS HE LISTENED HAD SEIZED A CANE THAT MONTPARNASSE HELD IN
HIS HAND AND MECHANICALLY PULLED AT THE UPPER PART AND THE BLADE OF A
DAGGER MADE ITS APPEARANCE
AH HE EXCLAIMED PUSHING THE DAGGER BACK IN HASTE YOU HAVE BROUGHT
ALONG YOUR GENDARME DISGUISED AS A BOURGEOIS
MONTPARNASSE WINKED
THE DEUCE RESUMED GAVROCHE SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BOUT WITH THE
BOBBIES
YOU CAN'T TELL REPLIED MONTPARNASSE WITH AN INDIFFERENT AIR
IT'S
ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO HAVE A PIN ABOUT ONE
GAVROCHE PERSISTED
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO TO NIGHT
AGAIN MONTPARNASSE TOOK A GRAVE TONE AND SAID MOUTHING EVERY SYLLABLE
THINGS
AND ABRUPTLY CHANGING THE CONVERSATION
BY THE WAY
WHAT
SOMETHING HAPPENED T'OTHER DAY
FANCY
I MEET A BOURGEOIS
HE MAKES
ME A PRESENT OF A SERMON AND HIS PURSE
I PUT IT IN MY POCKET
A MINUTE
LATER I FEEL IN MY POCKET
THERE'S NOTHING THERE
EXCEPT THE SERMON SAID GAVROCHE
BUT YOU WENT ON MONTPARNASSE WHERE ARE YOU BOUND FOR NOW
GAVROCHE POINTED TO HIS TWO PROTEGES AND SAID
I'M GOING TO PUT THESE INFANTS TO BED
WHEREABOUTS IS THE BED
AT MY HOUSE
WHERE'S YOUR HOUSE
AT MY HOUSE
SO YOU HAVE A LODGING
YES I HAVE
AND WHERE IS YOUR LODGING
IN THE ELEPHANT SAID GAVROCHE
MONTPARNASSE THOUGH NOT NATURALLY INCLINED TO ASTONISHMENT COULD NOT
RESTRAIN AN EXCLAMATION
IN THE ELEPHANT
WELL YES IN THE ELEPHANT RETORTED GAVROCHE
KEKCAA
THIS IS ANOTHER WORD OF THE LANGUAGE WHICH NO ONE WRITES AND WHICH
EVERY ONE SPEAKS
KEKCAA SIGNIFIES QUEST QUE C'EST QUE CELA A WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
THAT
THE URCHIN'S PROFOUND REMARK RECALLED MONTPARNASSE TO CALMNESS AND
GOOD SENSE
HE APPEARED TO RETURN TO BETTER SENTIMENTS WITH REGARD TO
GAVROCHE'S LODGING
OF COURSE SAID HE YES THE ELEPHANT
IS IT COMFORTABLE THERE
VERY SAID GAVROCHE
IT'S REALLY BULLY THERE
THERE AIN'T ANY
DRAUGHTS AS THERE ARE UNDER THE BRIDGES
HOW DO YOU GET IN
OH I GET IN
SO THERE IS A HOLE DEMANDED MONTPARNASSE
PARBLEU I SHOULD SAY SO
BUT YOU MUSTN'T TELL
IT'S BETWEEN THE FORE
LEGS
THE BOBBIES HAVEN'T SEEN IT
AND YOU CLIMB UP YES I UNDERSTAND
A TURN OF THE HAND CRIC CRAC AND IT'S ALL OVER NO ONE THERE
AFTER A PAUSE GAVROCHE ADDED
I SHALL HAVE A LADDER FOR THESE CHILDREN
MONTPARNASSE BURST OUT LAUGHING
WHERE THE DEVIL DID YOU PICK UP THOSE YOUNG 'UNS
GAVROCHE REPLIED WITH GREAT SIMPLICITY
THEY ARE SOME BRATS THAT A WIG MAKER MADE ME A PRESENT OF
MEANWHILE MONTPARNASSE HAD FALLEN TO THINKING
YOU RECOGNIZED ME VERY READILY HE MUTTERED
HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET TWO SMALL OBJECTS WHICH WERE NOTHING MORE THAN
TWO QUILLS WRAPPED IN COTTON AND THRUST ONE UP EACH OF HIS NOSTRILS
THIS GAVE HIM A DIFFERENT NOSE
THAT CHANGES YOU REMARKED GAVROCHE YOU ARE LESS HOMELY SO YOU
OUGHT TO KEEP THEM ON ALL THE TIME
MONTPARNASSE WAS A HANDSOME FELLOW BUT GAVROCHE WAS A TEASE
SERIOUSLY DEMANDED MONTPARNASSE HOW DO YOU LIKE ME SO
THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE WAS DIFFERENT ALSO
IN A TWINKLING MONTPARNASSE
HAD BECOME UNRECOGNIZABLE
OH DO PLAY PORRICHINELLE FOR US EXCLAIMED GAVROCHE
THE TWO CHILDREN WHO HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING UP TO THIS POINT BEING
OCCUPIED THEMSELVES IN THRUSTING THEIR FINGERS UP THEIR NOSES DREW
NEAR AT THIS NAME AND STARED AT MONTPARNASSE WITH DAWNING JOY AND
ADMIRATION
UNFORTUNATELY MONTPARNASSE WAS TROUBLED
HE LAID HIS HAND ON GAVROCHE'S SHOULDER AND SAID TO HIM EMPHASIZING
HIS WORDS LISTEN TO WHAT I TELL YOU BOY IF I WERE ON THE SQUARE WITH
MY DOG MY KNIFE AND MY WIFE AND IF YOU WERE TO SQUANDER TEN SOUS ON
ME I WOULDN'T REFUSE TO WORK BUT THIS ISN'T SHROVE TUESDAY
THIS ODD PHRASE PRODUCED A SINGULAR EFFECT ON THE GAMIN
HE WHEELED
ROUND HASTILY DARTED HIS LITTLE SPARKLING EYES ABOUT HIM WITH PROFOUND
ATTENTION AND PERCEIVED A POLICE SERGEANT STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO
THEM A FEW PACES OFF
GAVROCHE ALLOWED AN AH GOOD TO ESCAPE HIM
BUT IMMEDIATELY SUPPRESSED IT AND SHAKING MONTPARNASSE'S HAND
WELL GOOD EVENING SAID HE I'M GOING OFF TO MY ELEPHANT WITH MY
BRATS
SUPPOSING THAT YOU SHOULD NEED ME SOME NIGHT YOU CAN COME AND
HUNT ME UP THERE
I LODGE ON THE ENTRESOL
THERE IS NO PORTER
YOU WILL
INQUIRE FOR MONSIEUR GAVROCHE
VERY GOOD SAID MONTPARNASSE
AND THEY PARTED MONTPARNASSE BETAKING HIMSELF IN THE DIRECTION OF
THE GREVE AND GAVROCHE TOWARDS THE BASTILLE
THE LITTLE ONE OF FIVE
DRAGGED ALONG BY HIS BROTHER WHO WAS DRAGGED BY GAVROCHE TURNED HIS
HEAD BACK SEVERAL TIMES TO WATCH PORRICHINELLE AS HE WENT
THE AMBIGUOUS PHRASE BY MEANS OF WHICH MONTPARNASSE HAD WARNED GAVROCHE
OF THE PRESENCE OF THE POLICEMAN CONTAINED NO OTHER TALISMAN THAN
THE ASSONANCE DIG REPEATED FIVE OR SIX TIMES IN DIFFERENT FORMS
THIS
SYLLABLE DIG UTTERED ALONE OR ARTISTICALLY MINGLED WITH THE WORDS OF
A PHRASE MEANS TAKE CARE WE CAN NO LONGER TALK FREELY THERE WAS
BESIDES IN MONTPARNASSE'S SENTENCE A LITERARY BEAUTY WHICH WAS
LOST UPON GAVROCHE THAT IS MON DOGUE MA DAGUE ET MA DIGUE A SLANG
EXPRESSION OF THE TEMPLE WHICH SIGNIFIES MY DOG MY KNIFE AND MY WIFE
GREATLY IN VOGUE AMONG CLOWNS AND THE RED TAILS IN THE GREAT CENTURY
WHEN MOLIERE WROTE AND CALLOT DREW
TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE WAS STILL TO BE SEEN IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF
THE PLACE DE LA BASTILLE NEAR THE BASIN OF THE CANAL EXCAVATED IN THE
ANCIENT DITCH OF THE FORTRESS PRISON A SINGULAR MONUMENT WHICH HAS
ALREADY BEEN EFFACED FROM THE MEMORIES OF PARISIANS AND WHICH DESERVED
TO LEAVE SOME TRACE FOR IT WAS THE IDEA OF A MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE
THE GENERAL IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY OF EGYPT
WE SAY MONUMENT ALTHOUGH IT WAS ONLY A ROUGH MODEL
BUT THIS MODEL
ITSELF A MARVELLOUS SKETCH THE GRANDIOSE SKELETON OF AN IDEA OF
NAPOLEON'S WHICH SUCCESSIVE GUSTS OF WIND HAVE CARRIED AWAY AND THROWN
ON EACH OCCASION STILL FURTHER FROM US HAD BECOME HISTORICAL AND HAD
ACQUIRED A CERTAIN DEFINITENESS WHICH CONTRASTED WITH ITS PROVISIONAL
ASPECT
IT WAS AN ELEPHANT FORTY FEET HIGH CONSTRUCTED OF TIMBER AND
MASONRY BEARING ON ITS BACK A TOWER WHICH RESEMBLED A HOUSE FORMERLY
PAINTED GREEN BY SOME DAUBER AND NOW PAINTED BLACK BY HEAVEN THE WIND
AND TIME
IN THIS DESERTED AND UNPROTECTED CORNER OF THE PLACE THE
BROAD BROW OF THE COLOSSUS HIS TRUNK HIS TUSKS HIS TOWER HIS
ENORMOUS CRUPPER HIS FOUR FEET LIKE COLUMNS PRODUCED AT NIGHT UNDER
THE STARRY HEAVENS A SURPRISING AND TERRIBLE FORM
IT WAS A SORT OF
SYMBOL OF POPULAR FORCE
IT WAS SOMBRE MYSTERIOUS AND IMMENSE
IT WAS
SOME MIGHTY VISIBLE PHANTOM ONE KNEW NOT WHAT STANDING ERECT BESIDE
THE INVISIBLE SPECTRE OF THE BASTILLE
FEW STRANGERS VISITED THIS EDIFICE NO PASSER BY LOOKED AT IT
IT WAS
FALLING INTO RUINS EVERY SEASON THE PLASTER WHICH DETACHED ITSELF
FROM ITS SIDES FORMED HIDEOUS WOUNDS UPON IT
THE AEDILES AS THE
EXPRESSION RAN IN ELEGANT DIALECT HAD FORGOTTEN IT EVER SINCE 1814
THERE IT STOOD IN ITS CORNER MELANCHOLY SICK CRUMBLING SURROUNDED
BY A ROTTEN PALISADE SOILED CONTINUALLY BY DRUNKEN COACHMEN CRACKS
MEANDERED ATHWART ITS BELLY A LATH PROJECTED FROM ITS TAIL TALL GRASS
FLOURISHED BETWEEN ITS LEGS AND AS THE LEVEL OF THE PLACE HAD BEEN
RISING ALL AROUND IT FOR A SPACE OF THIRTY YEARS BY THAT SLOW AND
CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT WHICH INSENSIBLY ELEVATES THE SOIL OF LARGE TOWNS
IT STOOD IN A HOLLOW AND IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THE GROUND WERE GIVING WAY
BENEATH IT
IT WAS UNCLEAN DESPISED REPULSIVE AND SUPERB UGLY IN THE
EYES OF THE BOURGEOIS MELANCHOLY IN THE EYES OF THE THINKER
THERE WAS
SOMETHING ABOUT IT OF THE DIRT WHICH IS ON THE POINT OF BEING SWEPT OUT
AND SOMETHING OF THE MAJESTY WHICH IS ON THE POINT OF BEING DECAPITATED
AS WE HAVE SAID AT NIGHT ITS ASPECT CHANGED
NIGHT IS THE REAL ELEMENT
OF EVERYTHING THAT IS DARK
AS SOON AS TWILIGHT DESCENDED THE OLD
ELEPHANT BECAME TRANSFIGURED HE ASSUMED A TRANQUIL AND REDOUBTABLE
APPEARANCE IN THE FORMIDABLE SERENITY OF THE SHADOWS
BEING OF THE PAST
HE BELONGED TO NIGHT AND OBSCURITY WAS IN KEEPING WITH HIS GRANDEUR
THIS ROUGH SQUAT HEAVY HARD AUSTERE ALMOST MISSHAPEN BUT ASSUREDLY
MAJESTIC MONUMENT STAMPED WITH A SORT OF MAGNIFICENT AND SAVAGE
GRAVITY HAS DISAPPEARED AND LEFT TO REIGN IN PEACE A SORT OF GIGANTIC
STOVE ORNAMENTED WITH ITS PIPE WHICH HAS REPLACED THE SOMBRE FORTRESS
WITH ITS NINE TOWERS VERY MUCH AS THE BOURGEOISIE REPLACES THE FEUDAL
CLASSES
IT IS QUITE NATURAL THAT A STOVE SHOULD BE THE SYMBOL OF AN
EPOCH IN WHICH A POT CONTAINS POWER
THIS EPOCH WILL PASS AWAY PEOPLE
HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF THERE CAN BE FORCE IN A
BOILER THERE CAN BE NO FORCE EXCEPT IN THE BRAIN IN OTHER WORDS
THAT WHICH LEADS AND DRAGS ON THE WORLD IS NOT LOCOMOTIVES BUT IDEAS
HARNESS LOCOMOTIVES TO IDEAS THAT IS WELL DONE BUT DO NOT MISTAKE THE
HORSE FOR THE RIDER
AT ALL EVENTS TO RETURN TO THE PLACE DE LA BASTILLE THE ARCHITECT
OF THIS ELEPHANT SUCCEEDED IN MAKING A GRAND THING OUT OF PLASTER THE
ARCHITECT OF THE STOVE HAS SUCCEEDED IN MAKING A PRETTY THING OUT OF
BRONZE
THIS STOVE PIPE WHICH HAS BEEN BAPTIZED BY A SONOROUS NAME AND CALLED
THE COLUMN OF JULY THIS MONUMENT OF A REVOLUTION THAT MISCARRIED
WAS STILL ENVELOPED IN 1832 IN AN IMMENSE SHIRT OF WOODWORK WHICH WE
REGRET FOR OUR PART AND BY A VAST PLANK ENCLOSURE WHICH COMPLETED THE
TASK OF ISOLATING THE ELEPHANT
IT WAS TOWARDS THIS CORNER OF THE PLACE DIMLY LIGHTED BY THE REFLECTION
OF A DISTANT STREET LAMP THAT THE GAMIN GUIDED HIS TWO BRATS
THE READER MUST PERMIT US TO INTERRUPT OURSELVES HERE AND TO REMIND HIM
THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH SIMPLE REALITY AND THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO THE
TRIBUNALS WERE CALLED UPON TO JUDGE UNDER THE CHARGE OF VAGABONDAGE
AND MUTILATION OF A PUBLIC MONUMENT A CHILD WHO HAD BEEN CAUGHT ASLEEP
IN THIS VERY ELEPHANT OF THE BASTILLE
THIS FACT NOTED WE PROCEED
ON ARRIVING IN THE VICINITY OF THE COLOSSUS GAVROCHE COMPREHENDED THE
EFFECT WHICH THE INFINITELY GREAT MIGHT PRODUCE ON THE INFINITELY SMALL
AND SAID
DON'T BE SCARED INFANTS
THEN HE ENTERED THROUGH A GAP IN THE FENCE INTO THE ELEPHANT'S ENCLOSURE
AND HELPED THE YOUNG ONES TO CLAMBER THROUGH THE BREACH
THE TWO
CHILDREN SOMEWHAT FRIGHTENED FOLLOWED GAVROCHE WITHOUT UTTERING A
WORD AND CONFIDED THEMSELVES TO THIS LITTLE PROVIDENCE IN RAGS WHICH
HAD GIVEN THEM BREAD AND HAD PROMISED THEM A SHELTER
THERE EXTENDED ALONG THE FENCE LAY A LADDER WHICH BY DAY SERVED
THE LABORERS IN THE NEIGHBORING TIMBER YARD
GAVROCHE RAISED IT WITH
REMARKABLE VIGOR AND PLACED IT AGAINST ONE OF THE ELEPHANT'S FORELEGS
NEAR THE POINT WHERE THE LADDER ENDED A SORT OF BLACK HOLE IN THE BELLY
OF THE COLOSSUS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED
GAVROCHE POINTED OUT THE LADDER AND THE HOLE TO HIS GUESTS AND SAID TO
THEM
CLIMB UP AND GO IN
THE TWO LITTLE BOYS EXCHANGED TERRIFIED GLANCES
YOU'RE AFRAID BRATS EXCLAIMED GAVROCHE
AND HE ADDED
YOU SHALL SEE
HE CLASPED THE ROUGH LEG OF THE ELEPHANT AND IN A TWINKLING WITHOUT
DEIGNING TO MAKE USE OF THE LADDER HE HAD REACHED THE APERTURE
HE
ENTERED IT AS AN ADDER SLIPS THROUGH A CREVICE AND DISAPPEARED WITHIN
AND AN INSTANT LATER THE TWO CHILDREN SAW HIS HEAD WHICH LOOKED PALE
APPEAR VAGUELY ON THE EDGE OF THE SHADOWY HOLE LIKE A WAN AND WHITISH
SPECTRE
WELL HE EXCLAIMED CLIMB UP YOUNG 'UNS YOU'LL SEE HOW SNUG IT IS
HERE COME UP YOU HE SAID TO THE ELDER I'LL LEND YOU A HAND
THE LITTLE FELLOWS NUDGED EACH OTHER THE GAMIN FRIGHTENED AND INSPIRED
THEM WITH CONFIDENCE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME AND THEN IT WAS RAINING
VERY HARD
THE ELDER ONE UNDERTOOK THE RISK
THE YOUNGER ON SEEING HIS
BROTHER CLIMBING UP AND HIMSELF LEFT ALONE BETWEEN THE PAWS OF THIS
HUGE BEAST FELT GREATLY INCLINED TO CRY BUT HE DID NOT DARE
THE ELDER LAD CLIMBED WITH UNCERTAIN STEPS UP THE RUNGS OF THE LADDER
GAVROCHE IN THE MEANWHILE ENCOURAGING HIM WITH EXCLAMATIONS LIKE A
FENCING MASTER TO HIS PUPILS OR A MULETEER TO HIS MULES
DON'T BE AFRAID THAT'S IT COME ON PUT YOUR FEET THERE GIVE US
YOUR HAND HERE BOLDLY
AND WHEN THE CHILD WAS WITHIN REACH HE SEIZED HIM SUDDENLY AND
VIGOROUSLY BY THE ARM AND PULLED HIM TOWARDS HIM
NABBED SAID HE
THE BRAT HAD PASSED THROUGH THE CRACK
NOW SAID GAVROCHE WAIT FOR ME
BE SO GOOD AS TO TAKE A SEAT
MONSIEUR
AND MAKING HIS WAY OUT OF THE HOLE AS HE HAD ENTERED IT HE SLIPPED DOWN
THE ELEPHANT'S LEG WITH THE AGILITY OF A MONKEY LANDED ON HIS FEET IN
THE GRASS GRASPED THE CHILD OF FIVE ROUND THE BODY AND PLANTED HIM
FAIRLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LADDER THEN HE BEGAN TO CLIMB UP BEHIND
HIM SHOUTING TO THE ELDER
I'M GOING TO BOOST HIM DO YOU TUG
AND IN ANOTHER INSTANT THE SMALL LAD WAS PUSHED DRAGGED PULLED
THRUST STUFFED INTO THE HOLE BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO RECOVER HIMSELF
AND GAVROCHE ENTERING BEHIND HIM AND REPULSING THE LADDER WITH A KICK
WHICH SENT IT FLAT ON THE GRASS BEGAN TO CLAP HIS HANDS AND TO CRY
HERE WE ARE LONG LIVE GENERAL LAFAYETTE
THIS EXPLOSION OVER HE ADDED
NOW YOUNG 'UNS YOU ARE IN MY HOUSE
GAVROCHE WAS AT HOME IN FACT
OH UNFORESEEN UTILITY OF THE USELESS CHARITY OF GREAT THINGS GOODNESS
OF GIANTS THIS HUGE MONUMENT WHICH HAD EMBODIED AN IDEA OF THE
EMPEROR'S HAD BECOME THE BOX OF A STREET URCHIN
THE BRAT HAD BEEN
ACCEPTED AND SHELTERED BY THE COLOSSUS
THE BOURGEOIS DECKED OUT IN
THEIR SUNDAY FINERY WHO PASSED THE ELEPHANT OF THE BASTILLE WERE FOND
OF SAYING AS THEY SCANNED IT DISDAINFULLY WITH THEIR PROMINENT EYES
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THAT IT SERVED TO SAVE FROM THE COLD THE FROST
THE HAIL AND RAIN TO SHELTER FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER TO PRESERVE
FROM SLUMBER IN THE MUD WHICH PRODUCES FEVER AND FROM SLUMBER IN THE
SNOW WHICH PRODUCES DEATH A LITTLE BEING WHO HAD NO FATHER NO MOTHER
NO BREAD NO CLOTHES NO REFUGE
IT SERVED TO RECEIVE THE INNOCENT WHOM
SOCIETY REPULSED
IT SERVED TO DIMINISH PUBLIC CRIME
IT WAS A LAIR
OPEN TO ONE AGAINST WHOM ALL DOORS WERE SHUT
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE
MISERABLE OLD MASTODON INVADED BY VERMIN AND OBLIVION COVERED WITH
WARTS WITH MOULD AND ULCERS TOTTERING WORM EATEN ABANDONED
CONDEMNED A SORT OF MENDICANT COLOSSUS ASKING ALMS IN VAIN WITH A
BENEVOLENT LOOK IN THE MIDST OF THE CROSS ROADS HAD TAKEN PITY ON THAT
OTHER MENDICANT THE POOR PYGMY WHO ROAMED WITHOUT SHOES TO HIS FEET
WITHOUT A ROOF OVER HIS HEAD BLOWING ON HIS FINGERS CLAD IN RAGS FED
ON REJECTED SCRAPS
THAT WAS WHAT THE ELEPHANT OF THE BASTILLE WAS GOOD
FOR
THIS IDEA OF NAPOLEON DISDAINED BY MEN HAD BEEN TAKEN BACK BY
GOD
THAT WHICH HAD BEEN MERELY ILLUSTRIOUS HAD BECOME AUGUST
IN ORDER
TO REALIZE HIS THOUGHT THE EMPEROR SHOULD HAVE HAD PORPHYRY BRASS
IRON GOLD MARBLE THE OLD COLLECTION OF PLANKS BEAMS AND PLASTER
SUFFICED FOR GOD
THE EMPEROR HAD HAD THE DREAM OF A GENIUS IN THAT
TITANIC ELEPHANT ARMED PRODIGIOUS WITH TRUNK UPLIFTED BEARING ITS
TOWER AND SCATTERING ON ALL SIDES ITS MERRY AND VIVIFYING WATERS HE
WISHED TO INCARNATE THE PEOPLE
GOD HAD DONE A GRANDER THING WITH IT HE
HAD LODGED A CHILD THERE
THE HOLE THROUGH WHICH GAVROCHE HAD ENTERED WAS A BREACH WHICH WAS
HARDLY VISIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE BEING CONCEALED AS WE HAVE STATED
BENEATH THE ELEPHANT'S BELLY AND SO NARROW THAT IT WAS ONLY CATS AND
HOMELESS CHILDREN WHO COULD PASS THROUGH IT
LET'S BEGIN SAID GAVROCHE BY TELLING THE PORTER THAT WE ARE NOT AT
HOME
AND PLUNGING INTO THE DARKNESS WITH THE ASSURANCE OF A PERSON WHO IS
WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS APARTMENTS HE TOOK A PLANK AND STOPPED UP THE
APERTURE
AGAIN GAVROCHE PLUNGED INTO THE OBSCURITY
THE CHILDREN HEARD THE
CRACKLING OF THE MATCH THRUST INTO THE PHOSPHORIC BOTTLE
THE CHEMICAL
MATCH WAS NOT YET IN EXISTENCE AT THAT EPOCH THE FUMADE STEEL
REPRESENTED PROGRESS
A SUDDEN LIGHT MADE THEM BLINK GAVROCHE HAD JUST MANAGED TO IGNITE ONE
OF THOSE BITS OF CORD DIPPED IN RESIN WHICH ARE CALLED CELLAR RATS
THE
CELLAR RAT WHICH EMITTED MORE SMOKE THAN LIGHT RENDERED THE INTERIOR
OF THE ELEPHANT CONFUSEDLY VISIBLE
GAVROCHE'S TWO GUESTS GLANCED ABOUT THEM AND THE SENSATION WHICH THEY
EXPERIENCED WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH ONE WOULD FEEL IF SHUT UP IN
THE GREAT TUN OF HEIDELBERG OR BETTER STILL LIKE WHAT JONAH MUST HAVE
FELT IN THE BIBLICAL BELLY OF THE WHALE
AN ENTIRE AND GIGANTIC SKELETON
APPEARED ENVELOPING THEM
ABOVE A LONG BROWN BEAM WHENCE STARTED AT
REGULAR DISTANCES MASSIVE ARCHING RIBS REPRESENTED THE VERTEBRAL
COLUMN WITH ITS SIDES STALACTITES OF PLASTER DEPENDED FROM THEM LIKE
ENTRAILS AND VAST SPIDERS' WEBS STRETCHING FROM SIDE TO SIDE FORMED
DIRTY DIAPHRAGMS
HERE AND THERE IN THE CORNERS WERE VISIBLE LARGE
BLACKISH SPOTS WHICH HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING ALIVE AND WHICH
CHANGED PLACES RAPIDLY WITH AN ABRUPT AND FRIGHTENED MOVEMENT
FRAGMENTS WHICH HAD FALLEN FROM THE ELEPHANT'S BACK INTO HIS BELLY HAD
FILLED UP THE CAVITY SO THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO WALK UPON IT AS ON A
FLOOR
THE SMALLER CHILD NESTLED UP AGAINST HIS BROTHER AND WHISPERED TO
HIM
IT'S BLACK
THIS REMARK DREW AN EXCLAMATION FROM GAVROCHE
THE PETRIFIED AIR OF THE
TWO BRATS RENDERED SOME SHOCK NECESSARY
WHAT'S THAT YOU ARE GABBLING ABOUT THERE HE EXCLAIMED
ARE
YOU SCOFFING AT ME ARE YOU TURNING UP YOUR NOSES DO YOU WANT THE
TUILERIES ARE YOU BRUTES COME SAY I WARN YOU THAT I DON'T BELONG TO
THE REGIMENT OF SIMPLETONS
AH COME NOW ARE YOU BRATS FROM THE POPE'S
ESTABLISHMENT
A LITTLE ROUGHNESS IS GOOD IN CASES OF FEAR
IT IS REASSURING
THE TWO
CHILDREN DREW CLOSE TO GAVROCHE
GAVROCHE PATERNALLY TOUCHED BY THIS CONFIDENCE PASSED FROM GRAVE TO
GENTLE AND ADDRESSING THE SMALLER
STUPID SAID HE ACCENTING THE INSULTING WORD WITH A CARESSING
INTONATION IT'S OUTSIDE THAT IT IS BLACK
OUTSIDE IT'S RAINING HERE
IT DOES NOT RAIN OUTSIDE IT'S COLD HERE THERE'S NOT AN ATOM OF WIND
OUTSIDE THERE ARE HEAPS OF PEOPLE HERE THERE'S NO ONE OUTSIDE THERE
AIN'T EVEN THE MOON HERE THERE'S MY CANDLE CONFOUND IT
THE TWO CHILDREN BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE APARTMENT WITH LESS TERROR BUT
GAVROCHE ALLOWED THEM NO MORE TIME FOR CONTEMPLATION
QUICK SAID HE
AND HE PUSHED THEM TOWARDS WHAT WE ARE VERY GLAD TO BE ABLE TO CALL THE
END OF THE ROOM
THERE STOOD HIS BED
GAVROCHE'S BED WAS COMPLETE THAT IS TO SAY IT HAD A MATTRESS A
BLANKET AND AN ALCOVE WITH CURTAINS
THE MATTRESS WAS A STRAW MAT THE BLANKET A RATHER LARGE STRIP OF
GRAY WOOLLEN STUFF VERY WARM AND ALMOST NEW
THIS IS WHAT THE ALCOVE
CONSISTED OF
THREE RATHER LONG POLES THRUST INTO AND CONSOLIDATED WITH THE RUBBISH
WHICH FORMED THE FLOOR THAT IS TO SAY THE BELLY OF THE ELEPHANT TWO
IN FRONT AND ONE BEHIND AND UNITED BY A ROPE AT THEIR SUMMITS SO AS TO
FORM A PYRAMIDAL BUNDLE
THIS CLUSTER SUPPORTED A TRELLIS WORK OF BRASS
WIRE WHICH WAS SIMPLY PLACED UPON IT BUT ARTISTICALLY APPLIED AND HELD
BY FASTENINGS OF IRON WIRE SO THAT IT ENVELOPED ALL THREE HOLES
A ROW
OF VERY HEAVY STONES KEPT THIS NETWORK DOWN TO THE FLOOR SO THAT NOTHING
COULD PASS UNDER IT
THIS GRATING WAS NOTHING ELSE THAN A PIECE OF THE
BRASS SCREENS WITH WHICH AVIARIES ARE COVERED IN MENAGERIES
GAVROCHE'S
BED STOOD AS IN A CAGE BEHIND THIS NET
THE WHOLE RESEMBLED AN
ESQUIMAUX TENT
THIS TRELLIS WORK TOOK THE PLACE OF CURTAINS
GAVROCHE MOVED ASIDE THE STONES WHICH FASTENED THE NET DOWN IN FRONT
AND THE TWO FOLDS OF THE NET WHICH LAPPED OVER EACH OTHER FELL APART
DOWN ON ALL FOURS BRATS SAID GAVROCHE
HE MADE HIS GUESTS ENTER THE CAGE WITH GREAT PRECAUTION THEN HE CRAWLED
IN AFTER THEM PULLED THE STONES TOGETHER AND CLOSED THE OPENING
HERMETICALLY AGAIN
ALL THREE HAD STRETCHED OUT ON THE MAT
GAVROCHE STILL HAD THE CELLAR
RAT IN HIS HAND
NOW SAID HE GO TO SLEEP I'M GOING TO SUPPRESS THE CANDELABRA
MONSIEUR THE ELDER OF THE BROTHERS ASKED GAVROCHE POINTING TO THE
NETTING WHAT'S THAT FOR
THAT ANSWERED GAVROCHE GRAVELY IS FOR THE RATS
GO TO SLEEP
NEVERTHELESS HE FELT OBLIGED TO ADD A FEW WORDS OF INSTRUCTION FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THESE YOUNG CREATURES AND HE CONTINUED
IT'S A THING FROM THE JARDIN DES PLANTES
IT'S USED FOR FIERCE ANIMALS
THERE'S A WHOLE SHOPFUL OF THEM THERE
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TO CLIMB
OVER A WALL CRAWL THROUGH A WINDOW AND PASS THROUGH A DOOR
YOU CAN
GET AS MUCH AS YOU WANT
AS HE SPOKE HE WRAPPED THE YOUNGER ONE UP BODILY IN A FOLD OF THE
BLANKET AND THE LITTLE ONE MURMURED
OH HOW GOOD THAT IS IT'S WARM
GAVROCHE CAST A PLEASED EYE ON THE BLANKET
THAT'S FROM THE JARDIN DES PLANTES TOO SAID HE
I TOOK THAT FROM
THE MONKEYS
AND POINTING OUT TO THE ELDEST THE MAT ON WHICH HE WAS LYING A VERY
THICK AND ADMIRABLY MADE MAT HE ADDED
THAT BELONGED TO THE GIRAFFE
AFTER A PAUSE HE WENT ON
THE BEASTS HAD ALL THESE THINGS
I TOOK THEM AWAY FROM THEM
IT DIDN'T
TROUBLE THEM
I TOLD THEM 'IT'S FOR THE ELEPHANT
HE PAUSED AND THEN RESUMED
YOU CRAWL OVER THE WALLS AND YOU DON'T CARE A STRAW FOR THE GOVERNMENT
SO THERE NOW
THE TWO CHILDREN GAZED WITH TIMID AND STUPEFIED RESPECT ON THIS
INTREPID AND INGENIOUS BEING A VAGABOND LIKE THEMSELVES ISOLATED
LIKE THEMSELVES FRAIL LIKE THEMSELVES WHO HAD SOMETHING ADMIRABLE
AND ALL POWERFUL ABOUT HIM WHO SEEMED SUPERNATURAL TO THEM AND WHOSE
PHYSIOGNOMY WAS COMPOSED OF ALL THE GRIMACES OF AN OLD MOUNTEBANK
MINGLED WITH THE MOST INGENUOUS AND CHARMING SMILES
MONSIEUR VENTURED THE ELDER TIMIDLY YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF THE
POLICE THEN
GAVROCHE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH REPLYING
BRAT NOBODY SAYS 'POLICE THEY SAY 'BOBBIES
THE SMALLER HAD HIS EYES WIDE OPEN BUT HE SAID NOTHING
AS HE WAS ON
THE EDGE OF THE MAT THE ELDER BEING IN THE MIDDLE GAVROCHE TUCKED THE
BLANKET ROUND HIM AS A MOTHER MIGHT HAVE DONE AND HEIGHTENED THE MAT
UNDER HIS HEAD WITH OLD RAGS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO FORM A PILLOW FOR THE
CHILD
THEN HE TURNED TO THE ELDER
HEY WE'RE JOLLY COMFORTABLE HERE AIN'T WE
AH YES REPLIED THE ELDER GAZING AT GAVROCHE WITH THE EXPRESSION OF
A SAVED ANGEL
THE TWO POOR LITTLE CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN SOAKED THROUGH BEGAN TO GROW
WARM ONCE MORE
AH BY THE WAY CONTINUED GAVROCHE WHAT WERE YOU BAWLING ABOUT
AND POINTING OUT THE LITTLE ONE TO HIS BROTHER
A MITE LIKE THAT I'VE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT BUT THE IDEA OF A BIG
FELLOW LIKE YOU CRYING IT'S IDIOTIC YOU LOOKED LIKE A CALF
GRACIOUS REPLIED THE CHILD WE HAVE NO LODGING
BOTHER RETORTED GAVROCHE YOU DON'T SAY 'LODGINGS YOU SAY 'CRIB
AND THEN WE WERE AFRAID OF BEING ALONE LIKE THAT AT NIGHT
YOU DON'T SAY 'NIGHT YOU SAY 'DARKMANS
THANK YOU SIR SAID THE CHILD
LISTEN WENT ON GAVROCHE YOU MUST NEVER BAWL AGAIN OVER ANYTHING
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU
YOU SHALL SEE WHAT FUN WE'LL HAVE
IN SUMMER
WE'LL GO TO THE GLACIERE WITH NAVET ONE OF MY PALS WE'LL BATHE IN
THE GARE WE'LL RUN STARK NAKED IN FRONT OF THE RAFTS ON THE BRIDGE AT
AUSTERLITZ THAT MAKES THE LAUNDRESSES RAGING
THEY SCREAM THEY GET
MAD AND IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW RIDICULOUS THEY ARE WE'LL GO AND SEE THE
MAN SKELETON
AND THEN I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE PLAY
I'LL TAKE YOU TO SEE
FREDERICK LEMAITRE
I HAVE TICKETS I KNOW SOME OF THE ACTORS I EVEN
PLAYED IN A PIECE ONCE
THERE WERE A LOT OF US FELLERS AND WE RAN
UNDER A CLOTH AND THAT MADE THE SEA
I'LL GET YOU AN ENGAGEMENT AT MY
THEATRE
WE'LL GO TO SEE THE SAVAGES
THEY AIN'T REAL THOSE SAVAGES
AIN'T
THEY WEAR PINK TIGHTS THAT GO ALL IN WRINKLES AND YOU CAN SEE
WHERE THEIR ELBOWS HAVE BEEN DARNED WITH WHITE
THEN WE'LL GO TO THE
OPERA
WE'LL GET IN WITH THE HIRED APPLAUDERS
THE OPERA CLAQUE IS WELL
MANAGED
I WOULDN'T ASSOCIATE WITH THE CLAQUE ON THE BOULEVARD
AT THE
OPERA JUST FANCY SOME OF THEM PAY TWENTY SOUS BUT THEY'RE NINNIES
THEY'RE CALLED DISHCLOUTS
AND THEN WE'LL GO TO SEE THE GUILLOTINE WORK
I'LL SHOW YOU THE EXECUTIONER
HE LIVES IN THE RUE DES MARAIS
MONSIEUR
SANSON
HE HAS A LETTER BOX AT HIS DOOR
AH WE'LL HAVE FAMOUS FUN
AT THAT MOMENT A DROP OF WAX FELL ON GAVROCHE'S FINGER AND RECALLED HIM
TO THE REALITIES OF LIFE
THE DEUCE SAID HE THERE'S THE WICK GIVING OUT
ATTENTION I CAN'T
SPEND MORE THAN A SOU A MONTH ON MY LIGHTING
WHEN A BODY GOES TO BED
HE MUST SLEEP
WE HAVEN'T THE TIME TO READ M
PAUL DE KOCK'S
ROMANCES
AND BESIDES THE LIGHT MIGHT PASS THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE
PORTE COCHERE AND ALL THE BOBBIES NEED TO DO IS TO SEE IT
AND THEN REMARKED THE ELDER TIMIDLY HE ALONE DARED TALK TO
GAVROCHE AND REPLY TO HIM A SPARK MIGHT FALL IN THE STRAW AND WE
MUST LOOK OUT AND NOT BURN THE HOUSE DOWN
PEOPLE DON'T SAY 'BURN THE HOUSE DOWN REMARKED GAVROCHE THEY SAY
'BLAZE THE CRIB
THE STORM INCREASED IN VIOLENCE AND THE HEAVY DOWNPOUR BEAT UPON THE
BACK OF THE COLOSSUS AMID CLAPS OF THUNDER
YOU'RE TAKEN IN RAIN
SAID GAVROCHE
IT AMUSES ME TO HEAR THE DECANTER RUN DOWN THE LEGS OF
THE HOUSE
WINTER IS A STUPID IT WASTES ITS MERCHANDISE IT LOSES
ITS LABOR IT CAN'T WET US AND THAT MAKES IT KICK UP A ROW OLD
WATER CARRIER THAT IT IS
THIS ALLUSION TO THE THUNDER ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH GAVROCHE IN
HIS CHARACTER OF A PHILOSOPHER OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ACCEPTED WAS
FOLLOWED BY A BROAD FLASH OF LIGHTNING SO DAZZLING THAT A HINT OF IT
ENTERED THE BELLY OF THE ELEPHANT THROUGH THE CRACK
ALMOST AT THE SAME
INSTANT THE THUNDER RUMBLED WITH GREAT FURY
THE TWO LITTLE CREATURES
UTTERED A SHRIEK AND STARTED UP SO EAGERLY THAT THE NETWORK CAME NEAR
BEING DISPLACED BUT GAVROCHE TURNED HIS BOLD FACE TO THEM AND TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF THE CLAP OF THUNDER TO BURST INTO A LAUGH
CALM DOWN CHILDREN
DON'T TOPPLE OVER THE EDIFICE
THAT'S FINE
FIRST CLASS THUNDER ALL RIGHT
THAT'S NO SLOUCH OF A STREAK OF
LIGHTNING
BRAVO FOR THE GOOD GOD DEUCE TAKE IT IT'S ALMOST AS GOOD AS
IT IS AT THE AMBIGU
THAT SAID HE RESTORED ORDER IN THE NETTING PUSHED THE TWO CHILDREN
GENTLY DOWN ON THE BED PRESSED THEIR KNEES IN ORDER TO STRETCH THEM
OUT AT FULL LENGTH AND EXCLAIMED
SINCE THE GOOD GOD IS LIGHTING HIS CANDLE I CAN BLOW OUT MINE
NOW
BABES NOW MY YOUNG HUMANS YOU MUST SHUT YOUR PEEPERS
IT'S VERY BAD
NOT TO SLEEP
IT'LL MAKE YOU SWALLOW THE STRAINER OR AS THEY SAY IN
FASHIONABLE SOCIETY STINK IN THE GULLET
WRAP YOURSELF UP WELL IN THE
HIDE I'M GOING TO PUT OUT THE LIGHT
ARE YOU READY
YES MURMURED THE ELDER I'M ALL RIGHT
I SEEM TO HAVE FEATHERS UNDER
MY HEAD
PEOPLE DON'T SAY 'HEAD CRIED GAVROCHE THEY SAY 'NUT'
THE TWO CHILDREN NESTLED CLOSE TO EACH OTHER GAVROCHE FINISHED
ARRANGING THEM ON THE MAT DREW THE BLANKET UP TO THEIR VERY EARS THEN
REPEATED FOR THE THIRD TIME HIS INJUNCTION IN THE HIERATICAL TONGUE
SHUT YOUR PEEPERS
AND HE SNUFFED OUT HIS TINY LIGHT
HARDLY HAD THE LIGHT BEEN EXTINGUISHED WHEN A PECULIAR TREMBLING BEGAN
TO AFFECT THE NETTING UNDER WHICH THE THREE CHILDREN LAY
IT CONSISTED OF A MULTITUDE OF DULL SCRATCHES WHICH PRODUCED A METALLIC
SOUND AS IF CLAWS AND TEETH WERE GNAWING AT THE COPPER WIRE
THIS WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY ALL SORTS OF LITTLE PIERCING CRIES
THE LITTLE FIVE YEAR OLD BOY ON HEARING THIS HUBBUB OVERHEAD AND
CHILLED WITH TERROR JOGGED HIS BROTHER'S ELBOW BUT THE ELDER BROTHER
HAD ALREADY SHUT HIS PEEPERS AS GAVROCHE HAD ORDERED
THEN THE LITTLE
ONE WHO COULD NO LONGER CONTROL HIS TERROR QUESTIONED GAVROCHE BUT IN
A VERY LOW TONE AND WITH BATED BREATH
SIR
HEY SAID GAVROCHE WHO HAD JUST CLOSED HIS EYES
WHAT IS THAT
IT'S THE RATS REPLIED GAVROCHE
AND HE LAID HIS HEAD DOWN ON THE MAT AGAIN
THE RATS IN FACT WHO SWARMED BY THOUSANDS IN THE CARCASS OF THE
ELEPHANT AND WHO WERE THE LIVING BLACK SPOTS WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY
MENTIONED HAD BEEN HELD IN AWE BY THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE SO LONG AS
IT HAD BEEN LIGHTED BUT AS SOON AS THE CAVERN WHICH WAS THE SAME
AS THEIR CITY HAD RETURNED TO DARKNESS SCENTING WHAT THE GOOD
STORY TELLER PERRAULT CALLS FRESH MEAT THEY HAD HURLED THEMSELVES IN
THRONGS ON GAVROCHE'S TENT HAD CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF IT AND HAD BEGUN
TO BITE THE MESHES AS THOUGH SEEKING TO PIERCE THIS NEW FANGLED TRAP
STILL THE LITTLE ONE COULD NOT SLEEP
SIR HE BEGAN AGAIN
HEY SAID GAVROCHE
WHAT ARE RATS
THEY ARE MICE
THIS EXPLANATION REASSURED THE CHILD A LITTLE
HE HAD SEEN WHITE MICE IN
THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE AND HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF THEM
NEVERTHELESS HE
LIFTED UP HIS VOICE ONCE MORE
SIR
HEY SAID GAVROCHE AGAIN
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A CAT
I DID HAVE ONE REPLIED GAVROCHE I BROUGHT ONE HERE BUT THEY ATE
HER
THIS SECOND EXPLANATION UNDID THE WORK OF THE FIRST AND THE LITTLE
FELLOW BEGAN TO TREMBLE AGAIN
THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN HIM AND GAVROCHE BEGAN AGAIN FOR THE FOURTH TIME
MONSIEUR
HEY
WHO WAS IT THAT WAS EATEN
THE CAT
AND WHO ATE THE CAT
THE RATS
THE MICE
YES THE RATS
THE CHILD IN CONSTERNATION DISMAYED AT THE THOUGHT OF MICE WHICH ATE
CATS PURSUED
SIR WOULD THOSE MICE EAT US
WOULDN'T THEY JUST EJACULATED GAVROCHE
THE CHILD'S TERROR HAD REACHED ITS CLIMAX
BUT GAVROCHE ADDED
DON'T BE AFRAID
THEY CAN'T GET IN
AND BESIDES I'M HERE HERE CATCH
HOLD OF MY HAND
HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND SHUT YOUR PEEPERS
AT THE SAME TIME GAVROCHE GRASPED THE LITTLE FELLOW'S HAND ACROSS HIS
BROTHER
THE CHILD PRESSED THE HAND CLOSE TO HIM AND FELT REASSURED
COURAGE AND STRENGTH HAVE THESE MYSTERIOUS WAYS OF COMMUNICATING
THEMSELVES
SILENCE REIGNED ROUND THEM ONCE MORE THE SOUND OF THEIR
VOICES HAD FRIGHTENED OFF THE RATS AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES
THEY CAME RAGING BACK BUT IN VAIN THE THREE LITTLE FELLOWS WERE FAST
ASLEEP AND HEARD NOTHING MORE
THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT FLED AWAY
DARKNESS COVERED THE VAST PLACE DE LA
BASTILLE
A WINTRY GALE WHICH MINGLED WITH THE RAIN BLEW IN GUSTS THE
PATROL SEARCHED ALL THE DOORWAYS ALLEYS ENCLOSURES AND OBSCURE NOOKS
AND IN THEIR SEARCH FOR NOCTURNAL VAGABONDS THEY PASSED IN SILENCE
BEFORE THE ELEPHANT THE MONSTER ERECT MOTIONLESS STARING OPEN EYED
INTO THE SHADOWS HAD THE APPEARANCE OF DREAMING HAPPILY OVER HIS GOOD
DEED AND SHELTERED FROM HEAVEN AND FROM MEN THE THREE POOR SLEEPING
CHILDREN
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS ABOUT TO FOLLOW THE READER MUST
REMEMBER THAT AT THAT EPOCH THE BASTILLE GUARD HOUSE WAS SITUATED AT
THE OTHER END OF THE SQUARE AND THAT WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THE VICINITY OF
THE ELEPHANT COULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD BY THE SENTINEL
TOWARDS THE END OF THAT HOUR WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDES THE DAWN A
MAN TURNED FROM THE RUE SAINT ANTOINE AT A RUN MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE
ENCLOSURE OF THE COLUMN OF JULY AND GLIDED BETWEEN THE PALINGS UNTIL HE
WAS UNDERNEATH THE BELLY OF THE ELEPHANT
IF ANY LIGHT HAD ILLUMINATED
THAT MAN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIVINED FROM THE THOROUGH MANNER IN WHICH
HE WAS SOAKED THAT HE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT IN THE RAIN
ARRIVED BENEATH
THE ELEPHANT HE UTTERED A PECULIAR CRY WHICH DID NOT BELONG TO ANY
HUMAN TONGUE AND WHICH A PAROQUET ALONE COULD HAVE IMITATED
TWICE HE
REPEATED THIS CRY OF WHOSE ORTHOGRAPHY THE FOLLOWING BARELY CONVEYS AN
IDEA
KIRIKIKIOU
AT THE SECOND CRY A CLEAR YOUNG MERRY VOICE RESPONDED FROM THE BELLY
OF THE ELEPHANT
YES
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE PLANK WHICH CLOSED THE HOLE WAS DRAWN ASIDE
AND GAVE PASSAGE TO A CHILD WHO DESCENDED THE ELEPHANT'S LEG AND FELL
BRISKLY NEAR THE MAN
IT WAS GAVROCHE
THE MAN WAS MONTPARNASSE
AS FOR HIS CRY OF KIRIKIKIOU THAT WAS DOUBTLESS WHAT THE CHILD HAD
MEANT WHEN HE SAID
YOU WILL ASK FOR MONSIEUR GAVROCHE
ON HEARING IT HE HAD WAKED WITH A START HAD CRAWLED OUT OF HIS
ALCOVE PUSHING APART THE NETTING A LITTLE AND CAREFULLY DRAWING IT
TOGETHER AGAIN THEN HE HAD OPENED THE TRAP AND DESCENDED
THE MAN AND THE CHILD RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER SILENTLY AMID THE GLOOM
MONTPARNASSE CONFINED HIMSELF TO THE REMARK
WE NEED YOU
COME LEND US A HAND
THE LAD ASKED FOR NO FURTHER ENLIGHTENMENT
I'M WITH YOU SAID HE
AND BOTH TOOK THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE RUE SAINT ANTOINE WHENCE
MONTPARNASSE HAD EMERGED WINDING RAPIDLY THROUGH THE LONG FILE OF
MARKET GARDENERS' CARTS WHICH DESCEND TOWARDS THE MARKETS AT THAT HOUR
THE MARKET GARDENERS CROUCHING HALF ASLEEP IN THEIR WAGONS AMID THE
SALADS AND VEGETABLES ENVELOPED TO THEIR VERY EYES IN THEIR MUFFLERS
ON ACCOUNT OF THE BEATING RAIN DID NOT EVEN GLANCE AT THESE STRANGE
PEDESTRIANS
CHAPTER III THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT
THIS IS WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE THAT SAME NIGHT AT THE LA FORCE
AN ESCAPE HAD BEEN PLANNED BETWEEN BABET BRUJON GUELEMER AND
THENARDIER ALTHOUGH THENARDIER WAS IN CLOSE CONFINEMENT
BABET HAD
ARRANGED THE MATTER FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT ON THE SAME DAY AS THE READER
HAS SEEN FROM MONTPARNASSE'S ACCOUNT TO GAVROCHE
MONTPARNASSE WAS TO
HELP THEM FROM OUTSIDE
BRUJON AFTER HAVING PASSED A MONTH IN THE PUNISHMENT CELL HAD HAD
TIME IN THE FIRST PLACE TO WEAVE A ROPE IN THE SECOND TO MATURE A
PLAN
IN FORMER TIMES THOSE SEVERE PLACES WHERE THE DISCIPLINE OF THE
PRISON DELIVERS THE CONVICT INTO HIS OWN HANDS WERE COMPOSED OF FOUR
STONE WALLS A STONE CEILING A FLAGGED PAVEMENT A CAMP BED A GRATED
WINDOW AND A DOOR LINED WITH IRON AND WERE CALLED DUNGEONS BUT THE
DUNGEON WAS JUDGED TO BE TOO TERRIBLE NOWADAYS THEY ARE COMPOSED OF AN
IRON DOOR A GRATED WINDOW A CAMP BED A FLAGGED PAVEMENT FOUR STONE
WALLS AND A STONE CEILING AND ARE CALLED CHAMBERS OF PUNISHMENT
A
LITTLE LIGHT PENETRATES TOWARDS MID DAY
THE INCONVENIENT POINT ABOUT
THESE CHAMBERS WHICH AS THE READER SEES ARE NOT DUNGEONS IS THAT THEY
ALLOW THE PERSONS WHO SHOULD BE AT WORK TO THINK
SO BRUJON MEDITATED AND HE EMERGED FROM THE CHAMBER OF PUNISHMENT WITH
A ROPE
AS HE HAD THE NAME OF BEING VERY DANGEROUS IN THE CHARLEMAGNE
COURTYARD HE WAS PLACED IN THE NEW BUILDING
THE FIRST THING HE FOUND
IN THE NEW BUILDING WAS GUELEMER THE SECOND WAS A NAIL GUELEMER THAT
IS TO SAY CRIME A NAIL THAT IS TO SAY LIBERTY
BRUJON OF WHOM IT
IS HIGH TIME THAT THE READER SHOULD HAVE A COMPLETE IDEA WAS WITH AN
APPEARANCE OF DELICATE HEALTH AND A PROFOUNDLY PREMEDITATED LANGUOR A
POLISHED INTELLIGENT SPRIG AND A THIEF WHO HAD A CARESSING GLANCE
AND AN ATROCIOUS SMILE
HIS GLANCE RESULTED FROM HIS WILL AND HIS
SMILE FROM HIS NATURE
HIS FIRST STUDIES IN HIS ART HAD BEEN DIRECTED
TO ROOFS
HE HAD MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN THE INDUSTRY OF THE MEN WHO TEAR
OFF LEAD WHO PLUNDER THE ROOFS AND DESPOIL THE GUTTERS BY THE PROCESS
CALLED DOUBLE PICKINGS
THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH PUT THE FINISHING TOUCH ON THE MOMENT PECULIARLY
FAVORABLE FOR AN ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE WAS THAT THE ROOFERS WERE RE LAYING
AND RE JOINTING AT THAT VERY MOMENT A PORTION OF THE SLATES ON THE
PRISON
THE SAINT BERNARD COURTYARD WAS NO LONGER ABSOLUTELY ISOLATED
FROM THE CHARLEMAGNE AND THE SAINT LOUIS COURTS
UP ABOVE THERE WERE
SCAFFOLDINGS AND LADDERS IN OTHER WORDS BRIDGES AND STAIRS IN THE
DIRECTION OF LIBERTY
THE NEW BUILDING WHICH WAS THE MOST CRACKED AND DECREPIT THING TO BE
SEEN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WAS THE WEAK POINT IN THE PRISON
THE WALLS
WERE EATEN BY SALTPETRE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD BEEN
OBLIGED TO LINE THE VAULTS OF THE DORMITORIES WITH A SHEATHING OF WOOD
BECAUSE STONES WERE IN THE HABIT OF BECOMING DETACHED AND FALLING ON
THE PRISONERS IN THEIR BEDS
IN SPITE OF THIS ANTIQUITY THE AUTHORITIES
COMMITTED THE ERROR OF CONFINING IN THE NEW BUILDING THE MOST
TROUBLESOME PRISONERS OF PLACING THERE THE HARD CASES AS THEY SAY IN
PRISON PARLANCE
THE NEW BUILDING CONTAINED FOUR DORMITORIES ONE ABOVE THE OTHER AND A
TOP STORY WHICH WAS CALLED THE BEL AIR FINE AIR
A LARGE CHIMNEY FLUE
PROBABLY FROM SOME ANCIENT KITCHEN OF THE DUKES DE LA FORCE STARTED
FROM THE GROUNDFLOOR TRAVERSED ALL FOUR STORIES CUT THE DORMITORIES
WHERE IT FIGURED AS A FLATTENED PILLAR INTO TWO PORTIONS AND FINALLY
PIERCED THE ROOF
GUELEMER AND BRUJON WERE IN THE SAME DORMITORY
THEY HAD BEEN PLACED BY
WAY OF PRECAUTION ON THE LOWER STORY
CHANCE ORDAINED THAT THE HEADS OF
THEIR BEDS SHOULD REST AGAINST THE CHIMNEY
THENARDIER WAS DIRECTLY OVER THEIR HEADS IN THE TOP STORY KNOWN AS
FINE AIR
THE PEDESTRIAN WHO HALTS ON THE RUE CULTURE SAINTE CATHERINE
AFTER PASSING THE BARRACKS OF THE FIREMEN IN FRONT OF THE PORTE COCHERE
OF THE BATHING ESTABLISHMENT BEHOLDS A YARD FULL OF FLOWERS AND SHRUBS
IN WOODEN BOXES AT THE EXTREMITY OF WHICH SPREADS OUT A LITTLE WHITE
ROTUNDA WITH TWO WINGS BRIGHTENED UP WITH GREEN SHUTTERS THE BUCOLIC
DREAM OF JEAN JACQUES
NOT MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO THERE ROSE ABOVE THAT ROTUNDA AN ENORMOUS
BLACK HIDEOUS BARE WALL BY WHICH IT WAS BACKED UP
THIS WAS THE OUTER WALL OF LA FORCE
THIS WALL BESIDE THAT ROTUNDA WAS MILTON VIEWED THROUGH BERQUIN
LOFTY AS IT WAS THIS WALL WAS OVERTOPPED BY A STILL BLACKER ROOF WHICH
COULD BE SEEN BEYOND
THIS WAS THE ROOF OF THE NEW BUILDING
THERE
ONE COULD DESCRY FOUR DORMER WINDOWS GUARDED WITH BARS THEY WERE THE
WINDOWS OF THE FINE AIR
A CHIMNEY PIERCED THE ROOF THIS WAS THE CHIMNEY WHICH TRAVERSED THE
DORMITORIES
THE BEL AIR THAT TOP STORY OF THE NEW BUILDING WAS A SORT OF LARGE
HALL WITH A MANSARD ROOF GUARDED WITH TRIPLE GRATINGS AND DOUBLE DOORS
OF SHEET IRON WHICH WERE STUDDED WITH ENORMOUS BOLTS
WHEN ONE ENTERED
FROM THE NORTH END ONE HAD ON ONE'S LEFT THE FOUR DORMER WINDOWS ON
ONE'S RIGHT FACING THE WINDOWS AT REGULAR INTERVALS FOUR SQUARE
TOLERABLY VAST CAGES SEPARATED BY NARROW PASSAGES BUILT OF MASONRY
TO ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF THE ELBOW AND THE REST UP TO THE ROOF OF IRON
BARS
THENARDIER HAD BEEN IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN ONE OF THESE CAGES SINCE
THE NIGHT OF THE 3D OF FEBRUARY
NO ONE WAS EVER ABLE TO DISCOVER HOW
AND BY WHAT CONNIVANCE HE SUCCEEDED IN PROCURING AND SECRETING A
BOTTLE OF WINE INVENTED SO IT IS SAID BY DESRUES WITH WHICH
A NARCOTIC IS MIXED AND WHICH THE BAND OF THE ENDORMEURS OR
SLEEP COMPELLERS RENDERED FAMOUS
THERE ARE IN MANY PRISONS TREACHEROUS EMPLOYEES HALF JAILERS
HALF THIEVES WHO ASSIST IN ESCAPES WHO SELL TO THE POLICE AN
UNFAITHFUL SERVICE AND WHO TURN A PENNY WHENEVER THEY CAN
ON THAT SAME NIGHT THEN WHEN LITTLE GAVROCHE PICKED UP THE TWO LOST
CHILDREN BRUJON AND GUELEMER WHO KNEW THAT BABET WHO HAD ESCAPED THAT
MORNING WAS WAITING FOR THEM IN THE STREET AS WELL AS MONTPARNASSE
ROSE SOFTLY AND WITH THE NAIL WHICH BRUJON HAD FOUND BEGAN TO PIERCE
THE CHIMNEY AGAINST WHICH THEIR BEDS STOOD
THE RUBBISH FELL ON BRUJON'S
BED SO THAT THEY WERE NOT HEARD
SHOWERS MINGLED WITH THUNDER SHOOK
THE DOORS ON THEIR HINGES AND CREATED IN THE PRISON A TERRIBLE AND
OPPORTUNE UPROAR
THOSE OF THE PRISONERS WHO WOKE PRETENDED TO FALL
ASLEEP AGAIN AND LEFT GUELEMER AND BRUJON TO THEIR OWN DEVICES
BRUJON
WAS ADROIT GUELEMER WAS VIGOROUS
BEFORE ANY SOUND HAD REACHED THE
WATCHER WHO WAS SLEEPING IN THE GRATED CELL WHICH OPENED INTO THE
DORMITORY THE WALL HAD BEEN PIERCED THE CHIMNEY SCALED THE IRON
GRATING WHICH BARRED THE UPPER ORIFICE OF THE FLUE FORCED AND THE TWO
REDOUBTABLE RUFFIANS WERE ON THE ROOF
THE WIND AND RAIN REDOUBLED THE
ROOF WAS SLIPPERY
WHAT A GOOD NIGHT TO LEG IT SAID BRUJON
AN ABYSS SIX FEET BROAD AND EIGHTY FEET DEEP SEPARATED THEM FROM THE
SURROUNDING WALL
AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS ABYSS THEY COULD SEE THE MUSKET
OF A SENTINEL GLEAMING THROUGH THE GLOOM
THEY FASTENED ONE END OF THE
ROPE WHICH BRUJON HAD SPUN IN HIS DUNGEON TO THE STUMPS OF THE IRON BARS
WHICH THEY HAD JUST WRENCHED OFF FLUNG THE OTHER OVER THE OUTER WALL
CROSSED THE ABYSS AT ONE BOUND CLUNG TO THE COPING OF THE WALL GOT
ASTRIDE OF IT LET THEMSELVES SLIP ONE AFTER THE OTHER ALONG THE ROPE
UPON A LITTLE ROOF WHICH TOUCHES THE BATH HOUSE PULLED THEIR ROPE AFTER
THEM JUMPED DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE BATH HOUSE TRAVERSED IT
PUSHED OPEN THE PORTER'S WICKET BESIDE WHICH HUNG HIS ROPE PULLED
THIS OPENED THE PORTE COCHERE AND FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE STREET
THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE THEY HAD RISEN IN BED IN
THE DARK NAIL IN HAND AND THEIR PROJECT IN THEIR HEADS
A FEW MOMENTS LATER THEY HAD JOINED BABET AND MONTPARNASSE WHO WERE
PROWLING ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THEY HAD BROKEN THEIR ROPE IN PULLING IT AFTER THEM AND A BIT OF IT
REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE CHIMNEY ON THE ROOF
THEY HAD SUSTAINED NO
OTHER DAMAGE HOWEVER THAN THAT OF SCRATCHING NEARLY ALL THE SKIN OFF
THEIR HANDS
THAT NIGHT THENARDIER WAS WARNED WITHOUT ANY ONE BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN
HOW AND WAS NOT ASLEEP
TOWARDS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE NIGHT BEING VERY DARK HE SAW
TWO SHADOWS PASS ALONG THE ROOF IN THE RAIN AND SQUALLS IN FRONT OF
THE DORMER WINDOW WHICH WAS OPPOSITE HIS CAGE
ONE HALTED AT THE WINDOW
LONG ENOUGH TO DART IN A GLANCE
THIS WAS BRUJON
THENARDIER RECOGNIZED HIM AND UNDERSTOOD
THIS WAS ENOUGH
THENARDIER RATED AS A BURGLAR AND DETAINED AS A MEASURE OF PRECAUTION
UNDER THE CHARGE OF ORGANIZING A NOCTURNAL AMBUSH WITH ARMED FORCE WAS
KEPT IN SIGHT
THE SENTRY WHO WAS RELIEVED EVERY TWO HOURS MARCHED
UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF HIS CAGE WITH LOADED MUSKET
THE FINE AIR WAS
LIGHTED BY A SKYLIGHT
THE PRISONER HAD ON HIS FEET FETTERS WEIGHING
FIFTY POUNDS
EVERY DAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON A JAILER
ESCORTED BY TWO DOGS THIS WAS STILL IN VOGUE AT THAT TIME ENTERED
HIS CAGE DEPOSITED BESIDE HIS BED A LOAF OF BLACK BREAD WEIGHING TWO
POUNDS A JUG OF WATER A BOWL FILLED WITH RATHER THIN BOUILLON IN
WHICH SWAM A FEW MAYAGAN BEANS INSPECTED HIS IRONS AND TAPPED THE BARS
THIS MAN AND HIS DOGS MADE TWO VISITS DURING THE NIGHT
THENARDIER HAD OBTAINED PERMISSION TO KEEP A SORT OF IRON BOLT WHICH HE
USED TO SPIKE HIS BREAD INTO A CRACK IN THE WALL IN ORDER TO PRESERVE
IT FROM THE RATS AS HE SAID
AS THENARDIER WAS KEPT IN SIGHT
NO OBJECTION HAD BEEN MADE TO THIS SPIKE
STILL IT WAS REMEMBERED
AFTERWARDS THAT ONE OF THE JAILERS HAD SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LET
HIM HAVE ONLY A WOODEN SPIKE
AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE SENTINEL WHO WAS AN OLD SOLDIER WAS
RELIEVED AND REPLACED BY A CONSCRIPT
A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE MAN WITH
THE DOGS PAID HIS VISIT AND WENT OFF WITHOUT NOTICING ANYTHING EXCEPT
POSSIBLY THE EXCESSIVE YOUTH AND THE RUSTIC AIR OF THE RAW RECRUIT
TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS AT FOUR O'CLOCK WHEN THEY CAME TO RELIEVE THE
CONSCRIPT HE WAS FOUND ASLEEP ON THE FLOOR LYING LIKE A LOG NEAR
THENARDIER'S CAGE
AS FOR THENARDIER HE WAS NO LONGER THERE
THERE WAS
A HOLE IN THE CEILING OF HIS CAGE AND ABOVE IT ANOTHER HOLE IN THE
ROOF
ONE OF THE PLANKS OF HIS BED HAD BEEN WRENCHED OFF AND PROBABLY
CARRIED AWAY WITH HIM AS IT WAS NOT FOUND
THEY ALSO SEIZED IN HIS CELL
A HALF EMPTY BOTTLE WHICH CONTAINED THE REMAINS OF THE STUPEFYING WINE
WITH WHICH THE SOLDIER HAD BEEN DRUGGED
THE SOLDIER'S BAYONET HAD
DISAPPEARED
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THIS DISCOVERY WAS MADE IT WAS ASSUMED THAT
THENARDIER WAS OUT OF REACH
THE TRUTH IS THAT HE WAS NO LONGER IN THE
NEW BUILDING BUT THAT HE WAS STILL IN GREAT DANGER
THENARDIER ON REACHING THE ROOF OF THE NEW BUILDING HAD FOUND THE
REMAINS OF BRUJON'S ROPE HANGING TO THE BARS OF THE UPPER TRAP OF THE
CHIMNEY BUT AS THIS BROKEN FRAGMENT WAS MUCH TOO SHORT HE HAD NOT
BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE BY THE OUTER WALL AS BRUJON AND GUELEMER HAD DONE
WHEN ONE TURNS FROM THE RUE DES BALLETS INTO THE RUE DU ROI DE SICILE
ONE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ENCOUNTERS A REPULSIVE RUIN
THERE STOOD ON
THAT SPOT IN THE LAST CENTURY A HOUSE OF WHICH ONLY THE BACK WALL NOW
REMAINS A REGULAR WALL OF MASONRY WHICH RISES TO THE HEIGHT OF THE
THIRD STORY BETWEEN THE ADJOINING BUILDINGS
THIS RUIN CAN BE RECOGNIZED
BY TWO LARGE SQUARE WINDOWS WHICH ARE STILL TO BE SEEN THERE THE MIDDLE
ONE THAT NEAREST THE RIGHT GABLE IS BARRED WITH A WORM EATEN BEAM
ADJUSTED LIKE A PROP
THROUGH THESE WINDOWS THERE WAS FORMERLY VISIBLE A
LOFTY AND LUGUBRIOUS WALL WHICH WAS A FRAGMENT OF THE OUTER WALL OF LA
FORCE
THE EMPTY SPACE ON THE STREET LEFT BY THE DEMOLISHED HOUSE IS
HALF FILLED BY A FENCE OF ROTTEN BOARDS SHORED UP BY FIVE STONE POSTS
IN THIS RECESS LIES CONCEALED A LITTLE SHANTY WHICH LEANS AGAINST THE
PORTION OF THE RUIN WHICH HAS REMAINED STANDING
THE FENCE HAS A GATE
WHICH A FEW YEARS AGO WAS FASTENED ONLY BY A LATCH
IT WAS THE CREST OF THIS RUIN THAT THENARDIER HAD SUCCEEDED IN REACHING
A LITTLE AFTER ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
HOW HAD HE GOT THERE THAT IS WHAT NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN
OR UNDERSTAND
THE LIGHTNING MUST AT THE SAME TIME HAVE HINDERED
AND HELPED HIM
HAD HE MADE USE OF THE LADDERS AND SCAFFOLDINGS OF THE
SLATERS TO GET FROM ROOF TO ROOF FROM ENCLOSURE TO ENCLOSURE FROM
COMPARTMENT TO COMPARTMENT TO THE BUILDINGS OF THE CHARLEMAGNE COURT
THEN TO THE BUILDINGS OF THE SAINT LOUIS COURT TO THE OUTER WALL AND
THENCE TO THE HUT ON THE RUE DU ROI DE SICILE BUT IN THAT ITINERARY
THERE EXISTED BREAKS WHICH SEEMED TO RENDER IT AN IMPOSSIBILITY
HAD
HE PLACED THE PLANK FROM HIS BED LIKE A BRIDGE FROM THE ROOF OF THE
FINE AIR TO THE OUTER WALL AND CRAWLED FLAT ON HIS BELLY ON THE COPING
OF THE OUTER WALL THE WHOLE DISTANCE ROUND THE PRISON AS FAR AS THE HUT
BUT THE OUTER WALL OF LA FORCE FORMED A CRENELLATED AND UNEQUAL LINE
IT MOUNTED AND DESCENDED IT DROPPED AT THE FIREMEN'S BARRACKS IT ROSE
TOWARDS THE BATH HOUSE IT WAS CUT IN TWAIN BY BUILDINGS IT WAS NOT
EVEN OF THE SAME HEIGHT ON THE HOTEL LAMOIGNON AS ON THE RUE PAVEE
EVERYWHERE OCCURRED FALLS AND RIGHT ANGLES AND THEN THE SENTINELS MUST
HAVE ESPIED THE DARK FORM OF THE FUGITIVE HENCE THE ROUTE TAKEN BY
THENARDIER STILL REMAINS RATHER INEXPLICABLE
IN TWO MANNERS FLIGHT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
HAD THENARDIER SPURRED ON BY THAT THIRST FOR LIBERTY WHICH
CHANGES PRECIPICES INTO DITCHES IRON BARS INTO WATTLES OF OSIER A
LEGLESS MAN INTO AN ATHLETE A GOUTY MAN INTO A BIRD STUPIDITY INTO
INSTINCT INSTINCT INTO INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE INTO GENIUS HAD
THENARDIER INVENTED A THIRD MODE NO ONE HAS EVER FOUND OUT
THE MARVELS OF ESCAPE CANNOT ALWAYS BE ACCOUNTED FOR
THE MAN WHO MAKES
HIS ESCAPE WE REPEAT IS INSPIRED THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE STAR AND
OF THE LIGHTNING IN THE MYSTERIOUS GLEAM OF FLIGHT THE EFFORT TOWARDS
DELIVERANCE IS NO LESS SURPRISING THAN THE FLIGHT TOWARDS THE SUBLIME
AND ONE SAYS OF THE ESCAPED THIEF HOW DID HE CONTRIVE TO SCALE THAT
WALL IN THE SAME WAY THAT ONE SAYS OF CORNEILLE WHERE DID HE FIND
THE MEANS OF DYING
AT ALL EVENTS DRIPPING WITH PERSPIRATION DRENCHED WITH RAIN WITH HIS
CLOTHES HANGING IN RIBBONS HIS HANDS FLAYED HIS ELBOWS BLEEDING HIS
KNEES TORN THENARDIER HAD REACHED WHAT CHILDREN IN THEIR FIGURATIVE
LANGUAGE CALL THE EDGE OF THE WALL OF THE RUIN THERE HE HAD STRETCHED
HIMSELF OUT AT FULL LENGTH AND THERE HIS STRENGTH HAD FAILED HIM
A
STEEP ESCARPMENT THREE STORIES HIGH SEPARATED HIM FROM THE PAVEMENT OF
THE STREET
THE ROPE WHICH HE HAD WAS TOO SHORT
THERE HE WAITED PALE EXHAUSTED DESPERATE WITH ALL THE DESPAIR WHICH
HE HAD UNDERGONE STILL HIDDEN BY THE NIGHT BUT TELLING HIMSELF THAT
THE DAY WAS ON THE POINT OF DAWNING ALARMED AT THE IDEA OF HEARING THE
NEIGHBORING CLOCK OF SAINT PAUL STRIKE FOUR WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AN
HOUR WHEN THE SENTINEL WAS RELIEVED AND WHEN THE LATTER WOULD BE FOUND
ASLEEP UNDER THE PIERCED ROOF STARING IN HORROR AT A TERRIBLE DEPTH AT
THE LIGHT OF THE STREET LANTERNS THE WET BLACK PAVEMENT THAT PAVEMENT
LONGED FOR YET FRIGHTFUL WHICH MEANT DEATH AND WHICH MEANT LIBERTY
HE ASKED HIMSELF WHETHER HIS THREE ACCOMPLICES IN FLIGHT HAD SUCCEEDED
IF THEY HAD HEARD HIM AND IF THEY WOULD COME TO HIS ASSISTANCE
HE
LISTENED
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PATROL NO ONE HAD PASSED THROUGH
THE STREET SINCE HE HAD BEEN THERE
NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THE DESCENT OF
THE MARKET GARDENERS FROM MONTREUIL FROM CHARONNE FROM VINCENNES
AND FROM BERCY TO THE MARKETS WAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE RUE
SAINT ANTOINE
FOUR O'CLOCK STRUCK
THENARDIER SHUDDERED
A FEW MOMENTS LATER THAT
TERRIFIED AND CONFUSED UPROAR WHICH FOLLOWS THE DISCOVERY OF AN ESCAPE
BROKE FORTH IN THE PRISON
THE SOUND OF DOORS OPENING AND SHUTTING THE
CREAKING OF GRATINGS ON THEIR HINGES A TUMULT IN THE GUARD HOUSE THE
HOARSE SHOUTS OF THE TURNKEYS THE SHOCK OF MUSKET BUTTS ON THE PAVEMENT
OF THE COURTS REACHED HIS EARS
LIGHTS ASCENDED AND DESCENDED PAST THE
GRATED WINDOWS OF THE DORMITORIES A TORCH RAN ALONG THE RIDGE POLE OF
THE TOP STORY OF THE NEW BUILDING THE FIREMEN BELONGING IN THE BARRACKS
ON THE RIGHT HAD BEEN SUMMONED
THEIR HELMETS WHICH THE TORCH LIGHTED
UP IN THE RAIN WENT AND CAME ALONG THE ROOFS
AT THE SAME TIME
THENARDIER PERCEIVED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BASTILLE A WAN WHITENESS
LIGHTING UP THE EDGE OF THE SKY IN DOLEFUL WISE
HE WAS ON TOP OF A WALL TEN INCHES WIDE STRETCHED OUT UNDER THE HEAVY
RAINS WITH TWO GULFS TO RIGHT AND LEFT UNABLE TO STIR SUBJECT TO THE
GIDDINESS OF A POSSIBLE FALL AND TO THE HORROR OF A CERTAIN ARREST
AND HIS THOUGHTS LIKE THE PENDULUM OF A CLOCK SWUNG FROM ONE OF THESE
IDEAS TO THE OTHER DEAD IF I FALL CAUGHT IF I STAY IN THE MIDST OF
THIS ANGUISH HE SUDDENLY SAW THE STREET BEING STILL DARK A MAN WHO
WAS GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS AND COMING FROM THE RUE PAVEE HALT IN THE
RECESS ABOVE WHICH THENARDIER WAS AS IT WERE SUSPENDED
HERE THIS
MAN WAS JOINED BY A SECOND WHO WALKED WITH THE SAME CAUTION THEN BY
A THIRD THEN BY A FOURTH
WHEN THESE MEN WERE RE UNITED ONE OF THEM
LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE GATE IN THE FENCE AND ALL FOUR ENTERED
THE ENCLOSURE IN WHICH THE SHANTY STOOD
THEY HALTED DIRECTLY UNDER
THENARDIER
THESE MEN HAD EVIDENTLY CHOSEN THIS VACANT SPACE IN ORDER
THAT THEY MIGHT CONSULT WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY THE PASSERS BY OR BY THE
SENTINEL WHO GUARDS THE WICKET OF LA FORCE A FEW PACES DISTANT
IT
MUST BE ADDED THAT THE RAIN KEPT THIS SENTINEL BLOCKED IN HIS BOX
THENARDIER NOT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THEIR VISAGES LENT AN EAR TO
THEIR WORDS WITH THE DESPERATE ATTENTION OF A WRETCH WHO FEELS HIMSELF
LOST
THENARDIER SAW SOMETHING RESEMBLING A GLEAM OF HOPE FLASH BEFORE HIS
EYES THESE MEN CONVERSED IN SLANG
THE FIRST SAID IN A LOW BUT DISTINCT VOICE
LET'S CUT
WHAT ARE WE UP TO HERE
THE SECOND REPLIED IT'S RAINING HARD ENOUGH TO PUT OUT THE VERY
DEVIL'S FIRE
AND THE BOBBIES WILL BE ALONG INSTANTER
THERE'S A SOLDIER
ON GUARD YONDER
WE SHALL GET NABBED HERE
THESE TWO WORDS ICIGO AND ICICAILLE BOTH OF WHICH MEAN ICI AND WHICH
BELONG THE FIRST TO THE SLANG OF THE BARRIERS THE SECOND TO THE SLANG
OF THE TEMPLE WERE FLASHES OF LIGHT FOR THENARDIER
BY THE ICIGO HE
RECOGNIZED BRUJON WHO WAS A PROWLER OF THE BARRIERS BY THE ICICAILLE
HE KNEW BABET WHO AMONG HIS OTHER TRADES HAD BEEN AN OLD CLOTHES
BROKER AT THE TEMPLE
THE ANTIQUE SLANG OF THE GREAT CENTURY IS NO LONGER SPOKEN EXCEPT IN
THE TEMPLE AND BABET WAS REALLY THE ONLY PERSON WHO SPOKE IT IN ALL
ITS PURITY
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ICICAILLE THENARDIER WOULD NOT HAVE
RECOGNIZED HIM FOR HE HAD ENTIRELY CHANGED HIS VOICE
IN THE MEANWHILE THE THIRD MAN HAD INTERVENED
THERE'S NO HURRY YET LET'S WAIT A BIT
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT HE DOESN'T
STAND IN NEED OF US
BY THIS WHICH WAS NOTHING BUT FRENCH THENARDIER RECOGNIZED
MONTPARNASSE WHO MADE IT A POINT IN HIS ELEGANCE TO UNDERSTAND ALL
SLANGS AND TO SPEAK NONE OF THEM
AS FOR THE FOURTH HE HELD HIS PEACE BUT HIS HUGE SHOULDERS BETRAYED
HIM
THENARDIER DID NOT HESITATE
IT WAS GUELEMER
BRUJON REPLIED ALMOST IMPETUOUSLY BUT STILL IN A LOW TONE
WHAT ARE YOU JABBERING ABOUT THE TAVERN KEEPER HASN'T MANAGED TO CUT
HIS STICK
HE DON'T TUMBLE TO THE RACKET THAT HE DON'T YOU HAVE TO BE
A PRETTY KNOWING COVE TO TEAR UP YOUR SHIRT CUT UP YOUR SHEET TO MAKE
A ROPE PUNCH HOLES IN DOORS GET UP FALSE PAPERS MAKE FALSE KEYS FILE
YOUR IRONS HANG OUT YOUR CORD HIDE YOURSELF AND DISGUISE YOURSELF
THE OLD FELLOW HASN'T MANAGED TO PLAY IT HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO
WORK THE BUSINESS
BABET ADDED STILL IN THAT CLASSICAL SLANG WHICH WAS SPOKEN BY
POULAILLER AND CARTOUCHE AND WHICH IS TO THE BOLD NEW HIGHLY COLORED
AND RISKY ARGOT USED BY BRUJON WHAT THE LANGUAGE OF RACINE IS TO THE
LANGUAGE OF ANDRE CHENIER
YOUR TAVERN KEEPER MUST HAVE BEEN NABBED IN THE ACT
YOU HAVE TO BE
KNOWING
HE'S ONLY A GREENHORN
HE MUST HAVE LET HIMSELF BE TAKEN IN
BY A BOBBY PERHAPS EVEN BY A SHEEP WHO PLAYED IT ON HIM AS HIS PAL
LISTEN MONTPARNASSE DO YOU HEAR THOSE SHOUTS IN THE PRISON YOU HAVE
SEEN ALL THOSE LIGHTS
HE'S RECAPTURED THERE HE'LL GET OFF WITH TWENTY
YEARS
I AIN'T AFRAID I AIN'T A COWARD BUT THERE AIN'T ANYTHING MORE
TO DO OR OTHERWISE THEY'D LEAD US A DANCE
DON'T GET MAD COME WITH US
LET'S GO DRINK A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE TOGETHER
ONE DOESN'T DESERT ONE'S FRIENDS IN A SCRAPE GRUMBLED MONTPARNASSE
I TELL YOU HE'S NABBED RETORTED BRUJON
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT THE
INN KEEPER AIN'T WORTH A HA'PENNY
WE CAN'T DO NOTHING FOR HIM
LET'S BE
OFF
EVERY MINUTE I THINK A BOBBY HAS GOT ME IN HIS FIST
MONTPARNASSE NO LONGER OFFERED MORE THAN A FEEBLE RESISTANCE THE FACT
IS THAT THESE FOUR MEN WITH THE FIDELITY OF RUFFIANS WHO NEVER ABANDON
EACH OTHER HAD PROWLED ALL NIGHT LONG ABOUT LA FORCE GREAT AS WAS
THEIR PERIL IN THE HOPE OF SEEING THENARDIER MAKE HIS APPEARANCE ON THE
TOP OF SOME WALL
BUT THE NIGHT WHICH WAS REALLY GROWING TOO FINE FOR
THE DOWNPOUR WAS SUCH AS TO RENDER ALL THE STREETS DESERTED THE COLD
WHICH WAS OVERPOWERING THEM THEIR SOAKED GARMENTS THEIR HOLE RIDDEN
SHOES THE ALARMING NOISE WHICH HAD JUST BURST FORTH IN THE PRISON THE
HOURS WHICH HAD ELAPSED THE PATROL WHICH THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE
HOPE WHICH WAS VANISHING ALL URGED THEM TO BEAT A RETREAT
MONTPARNASSE
HIMSELF WHO WAS PERHAPS ALMOST THENARDIER'S SON IN LAW YIELDED
A
MOMENT MORE AND THEY WOULD BE GONE
THENARDIER WAS PANTING ON HIS WALL
LIKE THE SHIPWRECKED SUFFERERS OF THE MEDUSE ON THEIR RAFT WHEN THEY
BEHELD THE VESSEL WHICH HAD APPEARED IN SIGHT VANISH ON THE HORIZON
HE DARED NOT CALL TO THEM A CRY MIGHT BE HEARD AND RUIN EVERYTHING
AN
IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM A LAST IDEA A FLASH OF INSPIRATION HE DREW FROM
HIS POCKET THE END OF BRUJON'S ROPE WHICH HE HAD DETACHED FROM THE
CHIMNEY OF THE NEW BUILDING AND FLUNG IT INTO THE SPACE ENCLOSED BY THE
FENCE
THIS ROPE FELL AT THEIR FEET
A WIDOW 37 SAID BABET
MY TORTOUSE 38 SAID BRUJON
THE TAVERN KEEPER IS THERE SAID MONTPARNASSE
THEY RAISED THEIR EYES
THENARDIER THRUST OUT HIS HEAD A VERY LITTLE
QUICK SAID MONTPARNASSE HAVE YOU THE OTHER END OF THE ROPE
BRUJON
YES
KNOT THE TWO PIECES TOGETHER WE'LL FLING HIM THE ROPE HE CAN FASTEN
IT TO THE WALL AND HE'LL HAVE ENOUGH OF IT TO GET DOWN WITH
THENARDIER RAN THE RISK AND SPOKE
I AM PARALYZED WITH COLD
WE'LL WARM YOU UP
I CAN'T BUDGE
LET YOURSELF SLIDE WE'LL CATCH YOU
MY HANDS ARE BENUMBED
ONLY FASTEN THE ROPE TO THE WALL
I CAN'T
THEN ONE OF US MUST CLIMB UP SAID MONTPARNASSE
THREE STORIES EJACULATED BRUJON
AN ANCIENT PLASTER FLUE WHICH HAD SERVED FOR A STOVE THAT HAD BEEN USED
IN THE SHANTY IN FORMER TIMES RAN ALONG THE WALL AND MOUNTED ALMOST
TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE THEY COULD SEE THENARDIER
THIS FLUE THEN MUCH
DAMAGED AND FULL OF CRACKS HAS SINCE FALLEN BUT THE MARKS OF IT ARE
STILL VISIBLE
IT WAS VERY NARROW
ONE MIGHT GET UP BY THE HELP OF THAT SAID MONTPARNASSE
BY THAT FLUE EXCLAIMED BABET A GROWN UP COVE NEVER IT WOULD TAKE
A BRAT
A BRAT MUST BE GOT RESUMED BRUJON
WHERE ARE WE TO FIND A YOUNG 'UN SAID GUELEMER
WAIT SAID MONTPARNASSE
I'VE GOT THE VERY ARTICLE
HE OPENED THE GATE OF THE FENCE VERY SOFTLY MADE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS
PASSING ALONG THE STREET STEPPED OUT CAUTIOUSLY SHUT THE GATE BEHIND
HIM AND SET OFF AT A RUN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BASTILLE
SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES ELAPSED EIGHT THOUSAND CENTURIES TO THENARDIER
BABET BRUJON AND GUELEMER DID NOT OPEN THEIR LIPS AT LAST THE GATE
OPENED ONCE MORE AND MONTPARNASSE APPEARED BREATHLESS AND FOLLOWED BY
GAVROCHE
THE RAIN STILL RENDERED THE STREET COMPLETELY DESERTED
LITTLE GAVROCHE ENTERED THE ENCLOSURE AND GAZED AT THE FORMS OF THESE
RUFFIANS WITH A TRANQUIL AIR
THE WATER WAS DRIPPING FROM HIS HAIR
GUELEMER ADDRESSED HIM
ARE YOU A MAN YOUNG 'UN
GAVROCHE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND REPLIED
A YOUNG 'UN LIKE ME'S A MAN AND MEN LIKE YOU ARE BABES
THE BRAT'S TONGUE'S WELL HUNG EXCLAIMED BABET
THE PARIS BRAT AIN'T MADE OF STRAW ADDED BRUJON
WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED GAVROCHE
MONTPARNASSE ANSWERED
CLIMB UP THAT FLUE
WITH THIS ROPE SAID BABET
AND FASTEN IT CONTINUED BRUJON
TO THE TOP OF THE WALL WENT ON BABET
TO THE CROSS BAR OF THE WINDOW ADDED BRUJON
AND THEN SAID GAVROCHE
THERE SAID GUELEMER
THE GAMIN EXAMINED THE ROPE THE FLUE THE WALL THE WINDOWS AND MADE
THAT INDESCRIBABLE AND DISDAINFUL NOISE WITH HIS LIPS WHICH SIGNIFIES
IS THAT ALL
THERE'S A MAN UP THERE WHOM YOU ARE TO SAVE RESUMED MONTPARNASSE
WILL YOU BEGAN BRUJON AGAIN
GREENHORN REPLIED THE LAD AS THOUGH THE QUESTION APPEARED A MOST
UNPRECEDENTED ONE TO HIM
AND HE TOOK OFF HIS SHOES
GUELEMER SEIZED GAVROCHE BY ONE ARM SET HIM ON THE ROOF OF THE SHANTY
WHOSE WORM EATEN PLANKS BENT BENEATH THE URCHIN'S WEIGHT AND HANDED
HIM THE ROPE WHICH BRUJON HAD KNOTTED TOGETHER DURING MONTPARNASSE'S
ABSENCE
THE GAMIN DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE FLUE WHICH IT WAS
EASY TO ENTER THANKS TO A LARGE CRACK WHICH TOUCHED THE ROOF
AT THE
MOMENT WHEN HE WAS ON THE POINT OF ASCENDING THENARDIER WHO SAW LIFE
AND SAFETY APPROACHING BENT OVER THE EDGE OF THE WALL THE FIRST LIGHT
OF DAWN STRUCK WHITE UPON HIS BROW DRIPPING WITH SWEAT UPON HIS LIVID
CHEEK BONES HIS SHARP AND SAVAGE NOSE HIS BRISTLING GRAY BEARD AND
GAVROCHE RECOGNIZED HIM
HULLO IT'S MY FATHER OH THAT WON'T HINDER
AND TAKING THE ROPE IN HIS TEETH HE RESOLUTELY BEGAN THE ASCENT
HE REACHED THE SUMMIT OF THE HUT BESTRODE THE OLD WALL AS THOUGH IT HAD
BEEN A HORSE AND KNOTTED THE ROPE FIRMLY TO THE UPPER CROSS BAR OF THE
WINDOW
A MOMENT LATER THENARDIER WAS IN THE STREET
AS SOON AS HE TOUCHED THE PAVEMENT AS SOON AS HE FOUND HIMSELF OUT
OF DANGER HE WAS NO LONGER EITHER WEARY OR CHILLED OR TREMBLING THE
TERRIBLE THINGS FROM WHICH HE HAD ESCAPED VANISHED LIKE SMOKE ALL THAT
STRANGE AND FEROCIOUS MIND AWOKE ONCE MORE AND STOOD ERECT AND FREE
READY TO MARCH ONWARD
THESE WERE THIS MAN'S FIRST WORDS
NOW WHOM ARE WE TO EAT
IT IS USELESS TO EXPLAIN THE SENSE OF THIS FRIGHTFULLY TRANSPARENT
REMARK WHICH SIGNIFIES BOTH TO KILL TO ASSASSINATE AND TO PLUNDER
TO
EAT TRUE SENSE TO DEVOUR
LET'S GET WELL INTO A CORNER SAID BRUJON
LET'S SETTLE IT IN THREE
WORDS AND PART AT ONCE
THERE WAS AN AFFAIR THAT PROMISED WELL IN THE
RUE PLUMET A DESERTED STREET AN ISOLATED HOUSE AN OLD ROTTEN GATE ON
A GARDEN AND LONE WOMEN
WELL WHY NOT DEMANDED THENARDIER
YOUR GIRL EPONINE WENT TO SEE ABOUT THE MATTER REPLIED BABET
AND SHE BROUGHT A BISCUIT TO MAGNON ADDED GUELEMER
NOTHING TO BE
MADE THERE
THE GIRL'S NO FOOL SAID THENARDIER
STILL IT MUST BE SEEN TO
YES YES SAID BRUJON IT MUST BE LOOKED UP
IN THE MEANWHILE NONE OF THE MEN SEEMED TO SEE GAVROCHE WHO DURING
THIS COLLOQUY HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE OF THE FENCE POSTS HE WAITED
A FEW MOMENTS THINKING THAT PERHAPS HIS FATHER WOULD TURN TOWARDS HIM
THEN HE PUT ON HIS SHOES AGAIN AND SAID
IS THAT ALL YOU DON'T WANT ANY MORE MY MEN NOW YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR
SCRAPE
I'M OFF
I MUST GO AND GET MY BRATS OUT OF BED
AND OFF HE WENT
THE FIVE MEN EMERGED ONE AFTER ANOTHER FROM THE ENCLOSURE
WHEN GAVROCHE HAD DISAPPEARED AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DES BALLETS
BABET TOOK THENARDIER ASIDE
DID YOU TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THAT YOUNG 'UN HE ASKED
WHAT YOUNG 'UN
THE ONE WHO CLIMBED THE WALL AND CARRIED YOU THE ROPE
NOT PARTICULARLY
WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT IT WAS YOUR SON
BAH SAID THENARDIER DO YOU THINK SO
BOOK SEVENTH SLANG
ILLUSTRATION SLANG B7 1 SLANG
CHAPTER I ORIGIN
PIGRITIA IS A TERRIBLE WORD
IT ENGENDERS A WHOLE WORLD LA PEGRE FOR WHICH READ THEFT AND A HELL
LA PEGRENNE FOR WHICH READ HUNGER
THUS IDLENESS IS THE MOTHER
SHE HAS A SON THEFT AND A DAUGHTER HUNGER
WHERE ARE WE AT THIS MOMENT IN THE LAND OF SLANG
WHAT IS SLANG IT IS AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME A NATION AND A DIALECT
IT IS THEFT IN ITS TWO KINDS PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE
WHEN FOUR AND THIRTY YEARS AGO THE NARRATOR OF THIS GRAVE AND SOMBRE
HISTORY INTRODUCED INTO A WORK WRITTEN WITH THE SAME AIM AS THIS 39 A
THIEF WHO TALKED ARGOT THERE AROSE AMAZEMENT AND CLAMOR WHAT HOW
ARGOT WHY ARGOT IS HORRIBLE IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF PRISONS GALLEYS
CONVICTS OF EVERYTHING THAT IS MOST ABOMINABLE IN SOCIETY ETC ETC
WE HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THIS SORT OF OBJECTIONS
SINCE THAT TIME TWO POWERFUL ROMANCERS ONE OF WHOM IS A PROFOUND
OBSERVER OF THE HUMAN HEART THE OTHER AN INTREPID FRIEND OF THE PEOPLE
BALZAC AND EUGENE SUE HAVING REPRESENTED THEIR RUFFIANS AS TALKING
THEIR NATURAL LANGUAGE AS THE AUTHOR OF THE LAST DAY OF A CONDEMNED
MAN DID IN 1828 THE SAME OBJECTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED
PEOPLE REPEATED
WHAT DO AUTHORS MEAN BY THAT REVOLTING DIALECT SLANG IS ODIOUS SLANG
MAKES ONE SHUDDER
WHO DENIES THAT OF COURSE IT DOES
WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WOUND A GULF A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN
HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO THE BOTTOM WE HAVE
ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A
SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY
ACCEPTED AND FULFILLED MERITS
WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPLORE EVERYTHING
AND STUDY EVERYTHING WHY SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY THE HALT IS A
MATTER DEPENDING ON THE SOUNDING LINE AND NOT ON THE LEADSMAN
CERTAINLY TOO IT IS NEITHER AN ATTRACTIVE NOR AN EASY TASK TO
UNDERTAKE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE LOWEST DEPTHS OF THE SOCIAL ORDER
WHERE TERRA FIRMA COMES TO AN END AND WHERE MUD BEGINS TO RUMMAGE IN
THOSE VAGUE MURKY WAVES TO FOLLOW UP TO SEIZE AND TO FLING STILL
QUIVERING UPON THE PAVEMENT THAT ABJECT DIALECT WHICH IS DRIPPING WITH
FILTH WHEN THUS BROUGHT TO THE LIGHT THAT PUSTULOUS VOCABULARY EACH
WORD OF WHICH SEEMS AN UNCLEAN RING FROM A MONSTER OF THE MIRE AND THE
SHADOWS
NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN
ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF
SLANG
IT SEEMS IN FACT TO BE A SORT OF HORRIBLE BEAST MADE FOR THE
NIGHT WHICH HAS JUST BEEN TORN FROM ITS CESSPOOL
ONE THINKS ONE BEHOLDS
A FRIGHTFUL LIVING AND BRISTLING THICKET WHICH QUIVERS RUSTLES
WAVERS RETURNS TO SHADOW THREATENS AND GLARES
ONE WORD RESEMBLES A
CLAW ANOTHER AN EXTINGUISHED AND BLEEDING EYE SUCH AND SUCH A PHRASE
SEEMS TO MOVE LIKE THE CLAW OF A CRAB
ALL THIS IS ALIVE WITH
THE HIDEOUS VITALITY OF THINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED OUT OF
DISORGANIZATION
NOW WHEN HAS HORROR EVER EXCLUDED STUDY SINCE WHEN HAS MALADY BANISHED
MEDICINE CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE
BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TARANTULA AND ONE WHO WOULD
CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS THE
THINKER WHO SHOULD TURN ASIDE FROM SLANG WOULD RESEMBLE A SURGEON
WHO SHOULD AVERT HIS FACE FROM AN ULCER OR A WART
HE WOULD BE LIKE
A PHILOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER
HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
FOR IT MUST BE STATED
TO THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE CASE THAT ARGOT IS BOTH A LITERARY
PHENOMENON AND A SOCIAL RESULT
WHAT IS SLANG PROPERLY SPEAKING IT IS
THE LANGUAGE OF WRETCHEDNESS
WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS
ONE WAY OF ATTENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS
IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND ALL
FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SLANG
THE MERCHANT WHO SAYS
MONTPELLIER NOT ACTIVE MARSEILLES FINE QUALITY THE BROKER ON 'CHANGE
WHO SAYS ASSETS AT END OF CURRENT MONTH THE GAMBLER WHO SAYS TIERS

DIFFERENT FASHIONS OF SAYING THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT THE SAILOR'S PORT

NO DOUBT
BUT SAY WHAT WE WILL THIS MANNER OF UNDERSTANDING THE WORD
SLANG IS AN EXTENSION WHICH EVERY ONE WILL NOT ADMIT
FOR OUR PART
WE RESERVE TO THE WORD ITS ANCIENT AND PRECISE CIRCUMSCRIBED AND
DETERMINED SIGNIFICANCE AND WE RESTRICT SLANG TO SLANG
THE VERITABLE
SLANG AND THE SLANG THAT IS PRE EMINENTLY SLANG IF THE TWO WORDS CAN BE
COUPLED THUS THE SLANG IMMEMORIAL WHICH WAS A KINGDOM IS NOTHING
ELSE WE REPEAT THAN THE HOMELY UNEASY CRAFTY TREACHEROUS VENOMOUS
CRUEL EQUIVOCAL VILE PROFOUND FATAL TONGUE OF WRETCHEDNESS
THERE
EXISTS AT THE EXTREMITY OF ALL ABASEMENT AND ALL MISFORTUNES A LAST
MISERY WHICH REVOLTS AND MAKES UP ITS MIND TO ENTER INTO CONFLICT
WITH THE WHOLE MASS OF FORTUNATE FACTS AND REIGNING RIGHTS A FEARFUL
CONFLICT WHERE NOW CUNNING NOW VIOLENT UNHEALTHY AND FEROCIOUS
AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME IT ATTACKS THE SOCIAL ORDER WITH PIN PRICKS
THROUGH VICE AND WITH CLUB BLOWS THROUGH CRIME
TO MEET THE NEEDS OF
THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED A LANGUAGE OF COMBAT WHICH IS
SLANG
TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE
IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MAN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD
OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF
WHICH CIVILIZATION IS COMPOSED OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO EXTEND
THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF
THIS
SERVICE PLAUTUS RENDERED CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY BY MAKING TWO

PHOENICIAN VERY GOOD
LEVANTINE QUITE RIGHT EVEN DIALECT LET THAT PASS THEY ARE TONGUES
WHICH HAVE BELONGED TO NATIONS OR PROVINCES BUT SLANG WHAT IS THE USE
OF PRESERVING SLANG WHAT IS THE GOOD OF ASSISTING SLANG TO SURVIVE
TO THIS WE REPLY IN ONE WORD ONLY
ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A
NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE
WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND
STUDY
IT IS THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN IN FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE FOR
MORE THAN FOUR CENTURIES NOT ONLY BY A MISERY BUT BY EVERY POSSIBLE
HUMAN MISERY
AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND
INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY
IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED
THE HISTORIAN OF MANNERS
AND IDEAS HAS NO LESS AUSTERE A MISSION THAN THE HISTORIAN OF EVENTS
THE LATTER HAS THE SURFACE OF CIVILIZATION THE CONFLICTS OF CROWNS THE
BIRTHS OF PRINCES THE MARRIAGES OF KINGS BATTLES ASSEMBLAGES GREAT
PUBLIC MEN REVOLUTIONS IN THE DAYLIGHT EVERYTHING ON THE EXTERIOR
THE OTHER HISTORIAN HAS THE INTERIOR THE DEPTHS THE PEOPLE WHO TOIL
SUFFER WAIT THE OPPRESSED WOMAN THE AGONIZING CHILD THE SECRET WAR
BETWEEN MAN AND MAN OBSCURE FEROCITIES PREJUDICES PLOTTED
INIQUITIES THE SUBTERRANEAN THE INDISTINCT TREMORS OF MULTITUDES THE
DIE OF HUNGER THE COUNTER BLOWS OF THE LAW THE SECRET EVOLUTION OF
SOULS THE GO BARE FOOT THE BARE ARMED THE DISINHERITED THE ORPHANS
THE UNHAPPY AND THE INFAMOUS ALL THE FORMS WHICH ROAM THROUGH THE
DARKNESS
HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY
AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE
CASEMATES WHERE CRAWL PELL MELL THOSE WHO BLEED AND THOSE WHO DEAL THE
BLOW THOSE WHO WEEP AND THOSE WHO CURSE THOSE WHO FAST AND THOSE
WHO DEVOUR THOSE WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO INFLICT IT
HAVE THESE
HISTORIANS OF HEARTS AND SOULS DUTIES AT ALL INFERIOR TO THE HISTORIANS
OF EXTERNAL FACTS DOES ANY ONE THINK THAT ALIGHIERI HAS ANY FEWER
THINGS TO SAY THAN MACHIAVELLI IS THE UNDER SIDE OF CIVILIZATION ANY
LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE UPPER SIDE MERELY BECAUSE IT IS DEEPER AND MORE
SOMBRE DO WE REALLY KNOW THE MOUNTAIN WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED
WITH THE CAVERN
LET US SAY MOREOVER PARENTHETICALLY THAT FROM A FEW WORDS OF WHAT
PRECEDES A MARKED SEPARATION MIGHT BE INFERRED BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES
OF HISTORIANS WHICH DOES NOT EXIST IN OUR MIND
NO ONE IS A GOOD
HISTORIAN OF THE PATENT VISIBLE STRIKING AND PUBLIC LIFE OF PEOPLES
IF HE IS NOT AT THE SAME TIME IN A CERTAIN MEASURE THE HISTORIAN
OF THEIR DEEP AND HIDDEN LIFE AND NO ONE IS A GOOD HISTORIAN OF THE
INTERIOR UNLESS HE UNDERSTANDS HOW AT NEED TO BE THE HISTORIAN OF THE
EXTERIOR ALSO
THE HISTORY OF MANNERS AND IDEAS PERMEATES THE HISTORY
OF EVENTS AND THIS IS TRUE RECIPROCALLY
THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT
ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS
INTERLACED AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
ALL THE LINEAMENTS
WHICH PROVIDENCE TRACES ON THE SURFACE OF A NATION HAVE THEIR PARALLELS
SOMBRE BUT DISTINCT IN THEIR DEPTHS AND ALL CONVULSIONS OF THE DEPTHS
PRODUCE EBULLITIONS ON THE SURFACE
TRUE HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL
THINGS THE TRUE HISTORIAN MINGLES IN EVERYTHING
MAN IS NOT A CIRCLE WITH A SINGLE CENTRE HE IS AN ELLIPSE WITH A DOUBLE
FOCUS
FACTS FORM ONE OF THESE AND IDEAS THE OTHER
SLANG IS NOTHING BUT A DRESSING ROOM WHERE THE TONGUE HAVING SOME
BAD ACTION TO PERFORM DISGUISES ITSELF
THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN
WORD MASKS IN METAPHOR RAGS
IN THIS GUISE IT BECOMES HORRIBLE
ONE FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE
IS IT REALLY THE FRENCH TONGUE THE
GREAT HUMAN TONGUE BEHOLD IT READY TO STEP UPON THE STAGE AND TO RETORT
UPON CRIME AND PREPARED FOR ALL THE EMPLOYMENTS OF THE REPERTORY OF
EVIL
IT NO LONGER WALKS IT HOBBLES IT LIMPS ON THE CRUTCH OF THE
COURT OF MIRACLES A CRUTCH METAMORPHOSABLE INTO A CLUB IT IS CALLED
VAGRANCY EVERY SORT OF SPECTRE ITS DRESSERS HAVE PAINTED ITS FACE IT
CRAWLS AND REARS THE DOUBLE GAIT OF THE REPTILE
HENCEFORTH IT IS APT
AT ALL ROLES IT IS MADE SUSPICIOUS BY THE COUNTERFEITER COVERED WITH
VERDIGRIS BY THE FORGER BLACKED BY THE SOOT OF THE INCENDIARY AND THE
MURDERER APPLIES ITS ROUGE
WHEN ONE LISTENS BY THE SIDE OF HONEST MEN AT THE PORTALS OF SOCIETY
ONE OVERHEARS THE DIALOGUES OF THOSE WHO ARE ON THE OUTSIDE
ONE DISTINGUISHES QUESTIONS AND REPLIES
ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT
UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS
BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN ARTICULATE WORD
IT IS SLANG
THE WORDS ARE MISSHAPEN AND STAMPED WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE AND FANTASTIC
BESTIALITY
ONE THINKS ONE HEARS HYDRAS TALKING
IT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE IN THE DARK
IT GNASHES AND WHISPERS COMPLETING
THE GLOOM WITH MYSTERY
IT IS BLACK IN MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACKER STILL
IN CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSE SLANG
OBSCURITY
IN THE ATMOSPHERE OBSCURITY IN ACTS OBSCURITY IN VOICES
TERRIBLE
TOAD LIKE TONGUE WHICH GOES AND COMES LEAPS CRAWLS SLOBBERS AND
STIRS ABOUT IN MONSTROUS WISE IN THAT IMMENSE GRAY FOG COMPOSED OF RAIN
AND NIGHT OF HUNGER OF VICE OF FALSEHOOD OF INJUSTICE OF NUDITY OF
SUFFOCATION AND OF WINTER THE HIGH NOONDAY OF THE MISERABLE
LET US HAVE COMPASSION ON THE CHASTISED
ALAS WHO ARE WE OURSELVES WHO
AM I WHO NOW ADDRESS YOU WHO ARE YOU WHO ARE LISTENING TO ME AND ARE
YOU VERY SURE THAT WE HAVE DONE NOTHING BEFORE WE WERE BORN THE EARTH
IS NOT DEVOID OF RESEMBLANCE TO A JAIL
WHO KNOWS WHETHER MAN IS NOT A
RECAPTURED OFFENDER AGAINST DIVINE JUSTICE LOOK CLOSELY AT LIFE
IT IS
SO MADE THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
ARE YOU WHAT IS CALLED A HAPPY MAN WELL YOU ARE SAD EVERY DAY
EACH
DAY HAS ITS OWN GREAT GRIEF OR ITS LITTLE CARE
YESTERDAY YOU WERE
TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR
OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW
THE DIATRIBE OF A SLANDERER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME
FRIEND THEN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN
OR LOST THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE AND YOUR VERTEBRAL
COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE COURSE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
THIS WITHOUT
RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART
AND SO IT GOES ON
ONE CLOUD IS
DISPELLED ANOTHER FORMS
THERE IS HARDLY ONE DAY OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH
IS WHOLLY JOYOUS AND SUNNY
AND YOU BELONG TO THAT SMALL CLASS WHO ARE
HAPPY AS FOR THE REST OF MANKIND STAGNATING NIGHT RESTS UPON THEM
THOUGHTFUL MINDS MAKE BUT LITTLE USE OF THE PHRASE THE FORTUNATE AND
THE UNFORTUNATE
IN THIS WORLD EVIDENTLY THE VESTIBULE OF ANOTHER
THERE ARE NO FORTUNATE
THE REAL HUMAN DIVISION IS THIS THE LUMINOUS AND THE SHADY
TO DIMINISH
THE NUMBER OF THE SHADY TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT
IS THE OBJECT
THAT IS WHY WE CRY EDUCATION SCIENCE TO TEACH READING
MEANS TO LIGHT THE FIRE EVERY SYLLABLE SPELLED OUT SPARKLES
HOWEVER HE WHO SAYS LIGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY SAY JOY
PEOPLE SUFFER
IN THE LIGHT EXCESS BURNS
THE FLAME IS THE ENEMY OF THE WING
TO BURN
WITHOUT CEASING TO FLY THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF GENIUS
WHEN YOU SHALL HAVE LEARNED TO KNOW AND TO LOVE YOU WILL STILL SUFFER
THE DAY IS BORN IN TEARS
THE LUMINOUS WEEP IF ONLY OVER THOSE IN
DARKNESS
CHAPTER II ROOTS
SLANG IS THE TONGUE OF THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS
THOUGHT IS MOVED IN ITS MOST SOMBRE DEPTHS SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY IS BIDDEN
TO ITS MOST POIGNANT MEDITATIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT ENIGMATIC
DIALECT AT ONCE SO BLIGHTED AND REBELLIOUS
THEREIN LIES CHASTISEMENT
MADE VISIBLE
EVERY SYLLABLE HAS AN AIR OF BEING MARKED
THE WORDS OF
THE VULGAR TONGUE APPEAR THEREIN WRINKLED AND SHRIVELLED AS IT WERE
BENEATH THE HOT IRON OF THE EXECUTIONER
SOME SEEM TO BE STILL SMOKING
SUCH AND SUCH A PHRASE PRODUCES UPON YOU THE EFFECT OF THE SHOULDER OF A
THIEF BRANDED WITH THE FLEUR DE LYS WHICH HAS SUDDENLY BEEN LAID BARE
IDEAS ALMOST REFUSE TO BE EXPRESSED IN THESE SUBSTANTIVES WHICH ARE
FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE
METAPHOR IS SOMETIMES SO SHAMELESS THAT ONE
FEELS THAT IT HAS WORN THE IRON NECK FETTER
MOREOVER IN SPITE OF ALL THIS AND BECAUSE OF ALL THIS THIS STRANGE
DIALECT HAS BY RIGHTS ITS OWN COMPARTMENT IN THAT GREAT IMPARTIAL CASE
OF PIGEON HOLES WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR THE RUSTY FARTHING AS WELL AS
FOR THE GOLD MEDAL AND WHICH IS CALLED LITERATURE
SLANG WHETHER THE
PUBLIC ADMIT THE FACT OR NOT HAS ITS SYNTAX AND ITS POETRY
IT IS A
LANGUAGE
YES BY THE DEFORMITY OF CERTAIN TERMS WE RECOGNIZE THE
FACT THAT IT WAS CHEWED BY MANDRIN AND BY THE SPLENDOR OF CERTAIN
METONYMIES WE FEEL THAT VILLON SPOKE IT
THAT EXQUISITE AND CELEBRATED VERSE
MAIS OU SONT LES NEIGES D'ANTAN
BUT WHERE ARE THE SNOWS OF YEARS GONE BY
IS A VERSE OF SLANG
ANTAM ANTE ANNUM IS A WORD OF THUNES SLANG WHICH
SIGNIFIED THE PAST YEAR AND BY EXTENSION FORMERLY
THIRTY FIVE YEARS
AGO AT THE EPOCH OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE GREAT CHAIN GANG THERE COULD
BE READ IN ONE OF THE CELLS AT BICETRE THIS MAXIM ENGRAVED WITH A
NAIL ON THE WALL BY A KING OF THUNES CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS LES DABS
D'ANTAN TRIMAIENT SIEMPRE POUR LA PIERRE DU COESRE
THIS MEANS KINGS IN
DAYS GONE BY ALWAYS WENT AND HAD THEMSELVES ANOINTED
IN THE OPINION OF
THAT KING ANOINTMENT MEANT THE GALLEYS
THE WORD DECARADE WHICH EXPRESSES THE DEPARTURE OF HEAVY VEHICLES AT
A GALLOP IS ATTRIBUTED TO VILLON AND IT IS WORTHY OF HIM
THIS WORD
WHICH STRIKES FIRE WITH ALL FOUR OF ITS FEET SUMS UP IN A MASTERLY
ONOMATOPOEIA THE WHOLE OF LA FONTAINE'S ADMIRABLE VERSE
SIX FORTS CHEVAUX TIRAIENT UN COCHE
SIX STOUT HORSES DREW A COACH
FROM A PURELY LITERARY POINT OF VIEW FEW STUDIES WOULD PROVE MORE
CURIOUS AND FRUITFUL THAN THE STUDY OF SLANG
IT IS A WHOLE LANGUAGE
WITHIN A LANGUAGE A SORT OF SICKLY EXCRESCENCE AN UNHEALTHY GRAFT
WHICH HAS PRODUCED A VEGETATION A PARASITE WHICH HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE
OLD GALLIC TRUNK AND WHOSE SINISTER FOLIAGE CRAWLS ALL OVER ONE SIDE OF
THE LANGUAGE
THIS IS WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE FIRST THE VULGAR ASPECT OF
SLANG
BUT FOR THOSE WHO STUDY THE TONGUE AS IT SHOULD BE STUDIED THAT
IS TO SAY AS GEOLOGISTS STUDY THE EARTH SLANG APPEARS LIKE A VERITABLE
ALLUVIAL DEPOSIT
ACCORDING AS ONE DIGS A LONGER OR SHORTER DISTANCE
INTO IT ONE FINDS IN SLANG BELOW THE OLD POPULAR FRENCH PROVENCAL
SPANISH ITALIAN LEVANTINE THAT LANGUAGE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN PORTS
ENGLISH AND GERMAN THE ROMANCE LANGUAGE IN ITS THREE VARIETIES FRENCH
ITALIAN AND ROMANCE ROMANCE LATIN AND FINALLY BASQUE AND CELTIC
A
PROFOUND AND UNIQUE FORMATION
A SUBTERRANEAN EDIFICE ERECTED IN COMMON
BY ALL THE MISERABLE
EACH ACCURSED RACE HAS DEPOSITED ITS LAYER EACH
SUFFERING HAS DROPPED ITS STONE THERE EACH HEART HAS CONTRIBUTED ITS
PEBBLE
A THRONG OF EVIL BASE OR IRRITATED SOULS WHO HAVE TRAVERSED
LIFE AND HAVE VANISHED INTO ETERNITY LINGER THERE ALMOST ENTIRELY
VISIBLE STILL BENEATH THE FORM OF SOME MONSTROUS WORD
DO YOU WANT SPANISH THE OLD GOTHIC SLANG ABOUNDED IN IT
HERE IS
BOFFETE A BOX ON THE EAR WHICH IS DERIVED FROM BOFETON VANTANE
WINDOW LATER ON VANTERNE WHICH COMES FROM VANTANA GAT CAT WHICH
COMES FROM GATO ACITE OIL WHICH COMES FROM ACEYTE
DO YOU WANT
ITALIAN HERE IS SPADE SWORD WHICH COMES FROM SPADA CARVEL BOAT
WHICH COMES FROM CARAVELLA
DO YOU WANT ENGLISH HERE IS BICHOT WHICH
COMES FROM BISHOP RAILLE SPY WHICH COMES FROM RASCAL RASCALION
PILCHE A CASE WHICH COMES FROM PILCHER A SHEATH
DO YOU WANT GERMAN
HERE IS THE CALEUR THE WAITER KELLNER THE HERS THE MASTER HERZOG
DUKE
DO YOU WANT LATIN HERE IS FRANGIR TO BREAK FRANGERE AFFURER
TO STEAL FUR CADENE CHAIN CATENA
THERE IS ONE WORD WHICH CROPS UP
IN EVERY LANGUAGE OF THE CONTINENT WITH A SORT OF MYSTERIOUS POWER AND
AUTHORITY
IT IS THE WORD MAGNUS THE SCOTCHMAN MAKES OF IT HIS MAC
WHICH DESIGNATES THE CHIEF OF THE CLAN MAC FARLANE MAC CALLUMORE THE
GREAT FARLANE THE GREAT CALLUMORE 41 SLANG TURNS IT INTO MECK AND
LATER LE MEG THAT IS TO SAY GOD
WOULD YOU LIKE BASQUE HERE IS
GAHISTO THE DEVIL WHICH COMES FROM GAIZTOA EVIL SORGABON GOOD
NIGHT WHICH COMES FROM GABON GOOD EVENING
DO YOU WANT CELTIC HERE IS
BLAVIN A HANDKERCHIEF WHICH COMES FROM BLAVET GUSHING WATER MENESSE
A WOMAN IN A BAD SENSE WHICH COMES FROM MEINEC FULL OF STONES
BARANT BROOK FROM BARANTON FOUNTAIN GOFFEUR LOCKSMITH FROM GOFF
BLACKSMITH GUEDOUZE DEATH WHICH COMES FROM GUENN DU BLACK WHITE
FINALLY WOULD YOU LIKE HISTORY SLANG CALLS CROWNS LES MALTESES A
SOUVENIR OF THE COIN IN CIRCULATION ON THE GALLEYS OF MALTA
IN ADDITION TO THE PHILOLOGICAL ORIGINS JUST INDICATED SLANG POSSESSES
OTHER AND STILL MORE NATURAL ROOTS WHICH SPRING SO TO SPEAK FROM THE
MIND OF MAN ITSELF
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DIRECT CREATION OF WORDS
THEREIN LIES THE
MYSTERY OF TONGUES
TO PAINT WITH WORDS WHICH CONTAINS FIGURES
ONE KNOWS NOT HOW OR WHY IS THE PRIMITIVE FOUNDATION OF ALL HUMAN
LANGUAGES WHAT MAY BE CALLED THEIR GRANITE
SLANG ABOUNDS IN WORDS OF THIS DESCRIPTION IMMEDIATE WORDS WORDS
CREATED INSTANTANEOUSLY NO ONE KNOWS EITHER WHERE OR BY WHOM WITHOUT
ETYMOLOGY WITHOUT ANALOGIES WITHOUT DERIVATIVES SOLITARY BARBAROUS
SOMETIMES HIDEOUS WORDS WHICH AT TIMES POSSESS A SINGULAR POWER OF
EXPRESSION AND WHICH LIVE
THE EXECUTIONER LE TAULE THE FOREST
LE SABRI FEAR FLIGHT TAF THE LACKEY LE LARBIN THE MINERAL
THE PREFECT THE MINISTER PHAROS THE DEVIL LE RABOUIN
NOTHING IS
STRANGER THAN THESE WORDS WHICH BOTH MASK AND REVEAL
SOME LE RABOUIN
FOR EXAMPLE ARE AT THE SAME TIME GROTESQUE AND TERRIBLE AND PRODUCE ON
YOU THE EFFECT OF A CYCLOPEAN GRIMACE
IN THE SECOND PLACE METAPHOR
THE PECULIARITY OF A LANGUAGE WHICH IS
DESIROUS OF SAYING ALL YET CONCEALING ALL IS THAT IT IS RICH IN FIGURES
METAPHOR IS AN ENIGMA WHEREIN THE THIEF WHO IS PLOTTING A STROKE
THE PRISONER WHO IS ARRANGING AN ESCAPE TAKE REFUGE
NO IDIOM IS MORE
METAPHORICAL THAN SLANG DEVISSER LE COCO TO UNSCREW THE NUT TO TWIST
THE NECK TORTILLER TO WRIGGLE TO EAT ETRE GERBE TO BE TRIED A
RAT A BREAD THIEF IL LANSQUINE IT RAINS A STRIKING ANCIENT FIGURE
WHICH PARTLY BEARS ITS DATE ABOUT IT WHICH ASSIMILATES LONG OBLIQUE
LINES OF RAIN WITH THE DENSE AND SLANTING PIKES OF THE LANCERS AND
WHICH COMPRESSES INTO A SINGLE WORD THE POPULAR EXPRESSION IT RAINS
HALBERDS
SOMETIMES IN PROPORTION AS SLANG PROGRESSES FROM THE FIRST
EPOCH TO THE SECOND WORDS PASS FROM THE PRIMITIVE AND SAVAGE SENSE TO
THE METAPHORICAL SENSE
THE DEVIL CEASES TO BE LE RABOUIN AND BECOMES
LE BOULANGER THE BAKER WHO PUTS THE BREAD INTO THE OVEN
THIS IS
MORE WITTY BUT LESS GRAND SOMETHING LIKE RACINE AFTER CORNEILLE LIKE
EURIPIDES AFTER AESCHYLUS
CERTAIN SLANG PHRASES WHICH PARTICIPATE
IN THE TWO EPOCHS AND HAVE AT ONCE THE BARBARIC CHARACTER AND THE
METAPHORICAL CHARACTER RESEMBLE PHANTASMAGORIES
LES SORGUEUERS VONT
SOLLICITER DES GAILS A LA LUNE THE PROWLERS ARE GOING TO STEAL HORSES
BY NIGHT THIS PASSES BEFORE THE MIND LIKE A GROUP OF SPECTRES
ONE
KNOWS NOT WHAT ONE SEES
IN THE THIRD PLACE THE EXPEDIENT
SLANG LIVES ON THE LANGUAGE
IT USES
IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS FANCY IT DIPS INTO IT HAP HAZARD AND IT
OFTEN CONFINES ITSELF WHEN OCCASION ARISES TO ALTER IT IN A GROSS AND
SUMMARY FASHION
OCCASIONALLY WITH THE ORDINARY WORDS THUS DEFORMED AND
COMPLICATED WITH WORDS OF PURE SLANG PICTURESQUE PHRASES ARE FORMED IN
WHICH THERE CAN BE FELT THE MIXTURE OF THE TWO PRECEDING ELEMENTS THE
DIRECT CREATION AND THE METAPHOR LE CAB JASPINE JE MARRONNE QUE LA
ROULOTTE DE PANTIN TRIME DANS LE SABRI THE DOG IS BARKING I SUSPECT
THAT THE DILIGENCE FOR PARIS IS PASSING THROUGH THE WOODS
LE DAB EST
SINVE LA DABUGE EST MERLOUSSIERE LA FEE EST BATIVE THE BOURGEOIS IS
STUPID THE BOURGEOISE IS CUNNING THE DAUGHTER IS PRETTY
GENERALLY
TO THROW LISTENERS OFF THE TRACK SLANG CONFINES ITSELF TO ADDING TO
ALL THE WORDS OF THE LANGUAGE WITHOUT DISTINCTION AN IGNOBLE TAIL A
TERMINATION IN AILLE IN ORGUE IN IERGUE OR IN UCHE
THUS VOUSIERGUE
TROUVAILLE BONORGUE CE GIGOTMUCHE DO YOU THINK THAT LEG OF MUTTON
GOOD A PHRASE ADDRESSED BY CARTOUCHE TO A TURNKEY IN ORDER TO FIND OUT
WHETHER THE SUM OFFERED FOR HIS ESCAPE SUITED HIM
THE TERMINATION IN MAR HAS BEEN ADDED RECENTLY
SLANG BEING THE DIALECT OF CORRUPTION QUICKLY BECOMES CORRUPTED
ITSELF
BESIDES THIS AS IT IS ALWAYS SEEKING CONCEALMENT AS SOON AS
IT FEELS THAT IT IS UNDERSTOOD IT CHANGES ITS FORM
CONTRARY TO WHAT
HAPPENS WITH EVERY OTHER VEGETATION EVERY RAY OF LIGHT WHICH FALLS
UPON IT KILLS WHATEVER IT TOUCHES
THUS SLANG IS IN CONSTANT PROCESS OF
DECOMPOSITION AND RECOMPOSITION AN OBSCURE AND RAPID WORK WHICH NEVER
PAUSES
IT PASSES OVER MORE GROUND IN TEN YEARS THAN A LANGUAGE IN TEN
CENTURIES
THUS LE LARTON BREAD BECOMES LE LARTIF LE GAIL HORSE
BECOMES LE GAYE LA FERTANCHE STRAW BECOMES LA FERTILLE LE MOMIGNARD
BRAT LE MOMACQUE LES FIQUES DUDS FRUSQUES LA CHIQUE THE
CHURCH L'EGRUGEOIR LE COLABRE NECK LE COLAS
THE DEVIL IS AT

RATICHON THEN THE BOAR LE SANGLIER THE DAGGER IS LE VINGT DEUX
TWENTY TWO THEN LE SURIN THEN LE LINGRE THE POLICE ARE RAILLES
THEN ROUSSINS THEN ROUSSES THEN MARCHANDS DE LACETS DEALERS IN
STAY LACES THEN COQUERS THEN COGNES THE EXECUTIONER IS LE TAULE
THEN CHARLOT L'ATIGEUR THEN LE BECQUILLARD
IN THE SEVENTEENTH
CENTURY TO FIGHT WAS TO GIVE EACH OTHER SNUFF IN THE NINETEENTH
IT IS TO CHEW EACH OTHER'S THROATS THERE HAVE BEEN TWENTY DIFFERENT
PHRASES BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES
CARTOUCHE'S TALK WOULD HAVE BEEN
HEBREW TO LACENAIRE
ALL THE WORDS OF THIS LANGUAGE ARE PERPETUALLY
ENGAGED IN FLIGHT LIKE THE MEN WHO UTTER THEM
STILL FROM TIME TO TIME AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS VERY MOVEMENT
THE ANCIENT SLANG CROPS UP AGAIN AND BECOMES NEW ONCE MORE
IT HAS ITS
HEADQUARTERS WHERE IT MAINTAINS ITS SWAY
THE TEMPLE PRESERVED THE SLANG
OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BICETRE WHEN IT WAS A PRISON PRESERVED THE
SLANG OF THUNES
THERE ONE COULD HEAR THE TERMINATION IN ANCHE OF
THE OLD THUNEURS
BOYANCHES TU BOIS TU DO YOU DRINK BUT PERPETUAL
MOVEMENT REMAINS ITS LAW NEVERTHELESS
IF THE PHILOSOPHER SUCCEEDS IN FIXING FOR A MOMENT FOR PURPOSES OF
OBSERVATION THIS LANGUAGE WHICH IS INCESSANTLY EVAPORATING HE FALLS
INTO DOLEFUL AND USEFUL MEDITATION
NO STUDY IS MORE EFFICACIOUS AND
MORE FECUND IN INSTRUCTION
THERE IS NOT A METAPHOR NOT AN ANALOGY IN
SLANG WHICH DOES NOT CONTAIN A LESSON
AMONG THESE MEN TO BEAT MEANS
TO FEIGN ONE BEATS A MALADY RUSE IS THEIR STRENGTH
FOR THEM THE IDEA OF THE MAN IS NOT SEPARATED FROM THE IDEA OF
DARKNESS
THE NIGHT IS CALLED LA SORGUE MAN L'ORGUE
MAN IS A
DERIVATIVE OF THE NIGHT
THEY HAVE TAKEN UP THE PRACTICE OF CONSIDERING SOCIETY IN THE LIGHT
OF AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH KILLS THEM OF A FATAL FORCE AND THEY SPEAK OF
THEIR LIBERTY AS ONE WOULD SPEAK OF HIS HEALTH
A MAN UNDER ARREST IS A
SICK MAN ONE WHO IS CONDEMNED IS A DEAD MAN
THE MOST TERRIBLE THING FOR THE PRISONER WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS IN WHICH
HE IS BURIED IS A SORT OF GLACIAL CHASTITY AND HE CALLS THE DUNGEON
THE CASTUS
IN THAT FUNEREAL PLACE LIFE OUTSIDE ALWAYS PRESENTS ITSELF
UNDER ITS MOST SMILING ASPECT
THE PRISONER HAS IRONS ON HIS FEET YOU
THINK PERHAPS THAT HIS THOUGHT IS THAT IT IS WITH THE FEET THAT ONE
WALKS NO HE IS THINKING THAT IT IS WITH THE FEET THAT ONE DANCES SO
WHEN HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN SEVERING HIS FETTERS HIS FIRST IDEA IS THAT
NOW HE CAN DANCE AND HE CALLS THE SAW THE BASTRINGUE PUBLIC HOUSE
BALL A NAME IS A CENTRE PROFOUND ASSIMILATION THE RUFFIAN HAS TWO
HEADS ONE OF WHICH REASONS OUT HIS ACTIONS AND LEADS HIM ALL HIS LIFE
LONG AND THE OTHER WHICH HE HAS UPON HIS SHOULDERS ON THE DAY OF HIS
DEATH HE CALLS THE HEAD WHICH COUNSELS HIM IN CRIME LA SORBONNE
AND THE HEAD WHICH EXPIATES IT LA TRONCHE WHEN A MAN HAS NO LONGER
ANYTHING BUT RAGS UPON HIS BODY AND VICES IN HIS HEART WHEN HE HAS
ARRIVED AT THAT DOUBLE MORAL AND MATERIAL DEGRADATION WHICH THE WORD
BLACKGUARD CHARACTERIZES IN ITS TWO ACCEPTATIONS HE IS RIPE FOR CRIME
HE IS LIKE A WELL WHETTED KNIFE HE HAS TWO CUTTING EDGES HIS
DISTRESS AND HIS MALICE SO SLANG DOES NOT SAY A BLACKGUARD IT SAYS
UN REGUISE WHAT ARE THE GALLEYS A BRAZIER OF DAMNATION A HELL
THE
CONVICT CALLS HIMSELF A FAGOT AND FINALLY WHAT NAME DO MALEFACTORS
GIVE TO THEIR PRISON THE COLLEGE
A WHOLE PENITENTIARY SYSTEM CAN BE
EVOLVED FROM THAT WORD
DOES THE READER WISH TO KNOW WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE SONGS OF THE
GALLEYS THOSE REFRAINS CALLED IN THE SPECIAL VOCABULARY LIRLONFA HAVE
HAD THEIR BIRTH
LET HIM LISTEN TO WHAT FOLLOWS
THERE EXISTED AT THE CHATELET IN PARIS A LARGE AND LONG CELLAR
THIS
CELLAR WAS EIGHT FEET BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE SEINE
IT HAD NEITHER
WINDOWS NOR AIR HOLES ITS ONLY APERTURE WAS THE DOOR MEN COULD ENTER
THERE AIR COULD NOT
THIS VAULT HAD FOR CEILING A VAULT OF STONE AND
FOR FLOOR TEN INCHES OF MUD
IT WAS FLAGGED BUT THE PAVEMENT HAD ROTTED
AND CRACKED UNDER THE OOZING OF THE WATER
EIGHT FEET ABOVE THE FLOOR
A LONG AND MASSIVE BEAM TRAVERSED THIS SUBTERRANEAN EXCAVATION FROM SIDE
TO SIDE FROM THIS BEAM HUNG AT SHORT DISTANCES APART CHAINS THREE
FEET LONG AND AT THE END OF THESE CHAINS THERE WERE RINGS FOR THE
NECK
IN THIS VAULT MEN WHO HAD BEEN CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS WERE
INCARCERATED UNTIL THE DAY OF THEIR DEPARTURE FOR TOULON
THEY WERE
THRUST UNDER THIS BEAM WHERE EACH ONE FOUND HIS FETTERS SWINGING IN THE
DARKNESS AND WAITING FOR HIM
THE CHAINS THOSE PENDANT ARMS AND THE NECKLETS THOSE OPEN HANDS
CAUGHT THE UNHAPPY WRETCHES BY THE THROAT
THEY WERE RIVETTED AND
LEFT THERE
AS THE CHAIN WAS TOO SHORT THEY COULD NOT LIE DOWN
THEY
REMAINED MOTIONLESS IN THAT CAVERN IN THAT NIGHT BENEATH THAT BEAM
ALMOST HANGING FORCED TO UNHEARD OF EFFORTS TO REACH THEIR BREAD JUG
OR THEIR VAULT OVERHEAD MUD EVEN TO MID LEG FILTH FLOWING TO THEIR
VERY CALVES BROKEN ASUNDER WITH FATIGUE WITH THIGHS AND KNEES GIVING
WAY CLINGING FAST TO THE CHAIN WITH THEIR HANDS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN SOME
REST UNABLE TO SLEEP EXCEPT WHEN STANDING ERECT AND AWAKENED EVERY
MOMENT BY THE STRANGLING OF THE COLLAR SOME WOKE NO MORE
IN ORDER TO
EAT THEY PUSHED THE BREAD WHICH WAS FLUNG TO THEM IN THE MUD ALONG
THEIR LEG WITH THEIR HEEL UNTIL IT REACHED THEIR HAND
HOW LONG DID THEY REMAIN THUS ONE MONTH TWO MONTHS SIX MONTHS
SOMETIMES ONE STAYED A YEAR
IT WAS THE ANTECHAMBER OF THE GALLEYS
MEN WERE PUT THERE FOR STEALING A HARE FROM THE KING
IN THIS
SEPULCHRE HELL WHAT DID THEY DO WHAT MAN CAN DO IN A SEPULCHRE THEY
WENT THROUGH THE AGONIES OF DEATH AND WHAT CAN MAN DO IN HELL THEY
SANG FOR SONG LINGERS WHERE THERE IS NO LONGER ANY HOPE
IN THE WATERS
OF MALTA WHEN A GALLEY WAS APPROACHING THE SONG COULD BE HEARD BEFORE
THE SOUND OF THE OARS
POOR SURVINCENT THE POACHER WHO HAD GONE
THROUGH THE PRISON CELLAR OF THE CHATELET SAID IT WAS THE RHYMES THAT
KEPT ME UP USELESSNESS OF POETRY
WHAT IS THE GOOD OF RHYME
IT IS IN THIS CELLAR THAT NEARLY ALL THE SLANG SONGS HAD THEIR BIRTH
IT IS FROM THE DUNGEON OF THE GRAND CHATELET OF PARIS THAT COMES
THE MELANCHOLY REFRAIN OF THE MONTGOMERY GALLEY TIMALOUMISAINE
TIMALOUMISON THE MAJORITY OF THESE
ICICAILLE EST LA THEATRE HERE IS THE THEATRE
DU PETIT DARDANT
OF THE LITTLE ARCHER CUPID
DO WHAT YOU WILL YOU CANNOT ANNIHILATE THAT ETERNAL RELIC IN THE HEART
OF MAN LOVE
IN THIS WORLD OF DISMAL DEEDS PEOPLE KEEP THEIR SECRETS
THE SECRET IS
THE THING ABOVE ALL OTHERS
THE SECRET IN THE EYES OF THESE WRETCHES
IS UNITY WHICH SERVES AS A BASE OF UNION
TO BETRAY A SECRET IS TO
TEAR FROM EACH MEMBER OF THIS FIERCE COMMUNITY SOMETHING OF HIS OWN
PERSONALITY
TO INFORM AGAINST IN THE ENERGETIC SLANG DIALECT IS
CALLED TO EAT THE BIT AS THOUGH THE INFORMER DREW TO HIMSELF A
LITTLE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF ALL AND NOURISHED HIMSELF ON A BIT OF EACH
ONE'S FLESH
WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY TO RECEIVE A BOX ON THE EAR COMMONPLACE METAPHOR
REPLIES IT IS TO SEE THIRTY SIX CANDLES
HERE SLANG INTERVENES AND TAKES IT UP CANDLE CAMOUFLE
THEREUPON THE
ORDINARY TONGUE GIVES CAMOUFLET 42 AS THE SYNONYM FOR SOUFFLET
THUS
BY A SORT OF INFILTRATION FROM BELOW UPWARDS WITH THE AID OF METAPHOR
THAT INCALCULABLE TRAJECTORY SLANG MOUNTS FROM THE CAVERN TO THE
ACADEMY AND POULAILLER SAYING I LIGHT MY CAMOUFLE CAUSES VOLTAIRE
TO WRITE LANGLEVIEL LA BEAUMELLE DESERVES A HUNDRED CAMOUFLETS
RESEARCHES IN SLANG MEAN DISCOVERIES AT EVERY STEP
STUDY AND
INVESTIGATION OF THIS STRANGE IDIOM LEAD TO THE MYSTERIOUS POINT OF
INTERSECTION OF REGULAR SOCIETY WITH SOCIETY WHICH IS ACCURSED
THE THIEF ALSO HAS HIS FOOD FOR CANNON STEALABLE MATTER YOU I
WHOEVER PASSES BY LE PANTRE
PAN EVERYBODY
SLANG IS LANGUAGE TURNED CONVICT
THAT THE THINKING PRINCIPLE OF MAN BE THRUST DOWN EVER SO LOW THAT IT
CAN BE DRAGGED AND PINIONED THERE BY OBSCURE TYRANNIES OF FATALITY
THAT IT CAN BE BOUND BY NO ONE KNOWS WHAT FETTERS IN THAT ABYSS IS
SUFFICIENT TO CREATE CONSTERNATION
OH POOR THOUGHT OF MISERABLE WRETCHES
ALAS WILL NO ONE COME TO THE SUCCOR OF THE HUMAN SOUL IN THAT DARKNESS
IS IT HER DESTINY THERE TO AWAIT FOREVER THE MIND THE LIBERATOR THE
IMMENSE RIDER OF PEGASI AND HIPPO GRIFFS THE COMBATANT OF HEROES OF
THE DAWN WHO SHALL DESCEND FROM THE AZURE BETWEEN TWO WINGS THE RADIANT
KNIGHT OF THE FUTURE WILL SHE FOREVER SUMMON IN VAIN TO HER ASSISTANCE
THE LANCE OF LIGHT OF THE IDEAL IS SHE CONDEMNED TO HEAR THE FEARFUL
APPROACH OF EVIL THROUGH THE DENSITY OF THE GULF AND TO CATCH GLIMPSES
NEARER AND NEARER AT HAND BENEATH THE HIDEOUS WATER OF THAT DRAGON'S
HEAD THAT MAW STREAKED WITH FOAM AND THAT WRITHING UNDULATION OF
CLAWS SWELLINGS AND RINGS MUST IT REMAIN THERE WITHOUT A GLEAM
OF LIGHT WITHOUT HOPE GIVEN OVER TO THAT TERRIBLE APPROACH VAGUELY
SCENTED OUT BY THE MONSTER SHUDDERING DISHEVELLED WRINGING ITS ARMS
FOREVER CHAINED TO THE ROCK OF NIGHT A SOMBRE ANDROMEDA WHITE AND NAKED
AMID THE SHADOWS
CHAPTER III SLANG WHICH WEEPS AND SLANG WHICH LAUGHS
AS THE READER PERCEIVES SLANG IN ITS ENTIRETY SLANG OF FOUR HUNDRED
YEARS AGO LIKE THE SLANG OF TO DAY IS PERMEATED WITH THAT SOMBRE
SYMBOLICAL SPIRIT WHICH GIVES TO ALL WORDS A MIEN WHICH IS NOW MOURNFUL
NOW MENACING
ONE FEELS IN IT THE WILD AND ANCIENT SADNESS OF THOSE
VAGRANTS OF THE COURT OF MIRACLES WHO PLAYED AT CARDS WITH PACKS OF
THEIR OWN SOME OF WHICH HAVE COME DOWN TO US
THE EIGHT OF CLUBS FOR
INSTANCE REPRESENTED A HUGE TREE BEARING EIGHT ENORMOUS TREFOIL LEAVES
A SORT OF FANTASTIC PERSONIFICATION OF THE FOREST
AT THE FOOT OF THIS
TREE A FIRE WAS BURNING OVER WHICH THREE HARES WERE ROASTING A HUNTSMAN
ON A SPIT AND BEHIND HIM ON ANOTHER FIRE HUNG A STEAMING POT WHENCE
EMERGED THE HEAD OF A DOG
NOTHING CAN BE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN THESE
REPRISALS IN PAINTING BY A PACK OF CARDS IN THE PRESENCE OF STAKES
FOR THE ROASTING OF SMUGGLERS AND OF THE CAULDRON FOR THE BOILING OF
COUNTERFEITERS
THE DIVERSE FORMS ASSUMED BY THOUGHT IN THE REALM
OF SLANG EVEN SONG EVEN RAILLERY EVEN MENACE ALL PARTOOK OF THIS
POWERLESS AND DEJECTED CHARACTER
ALL THE SONGS THE MELODIES OF SOME
OF WHICH HAVE BEEN COLLECTED WERE HUMBLE AND LAMENTABLE TO THE POINT OF
EVOKING TEARS
THE PEGRE IS ALWAYS THE POOR PEGRE AND HE IS ALWAYS
THE HARE IN HIDING THE FUGITIVE MOUSE THE FLYING BIRD
HE HARDLY
COMPLAINS HE CONTENTS HIMSELF WITH SIGHING ONE OF HIS MOANS HAS COME
DOWN TO US I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW GOD THE FATHER OF MEN CAN TORTURE
HIS CHILDREN AND HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND HEAR THEM CRY WITHOUT HIMSELF
SUFFERING TORTURE 43 THE WRETCH WHENEVER HE HAS TIME TO THINK MAKES
HIMSELF SMALL BEFORE THE LOW AND FRAIL IN THE PRESENCE OF SOCIETY
HE LIES DOWN FLAT ON HIS FACE HE ENTREATS HE APPEALS TO THE SIDE OF
COMPASSION WE FEEL THAT HE IS CONSCIOUS OF HIS GUILT
TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY A CHANGE TOOK PLACE PRISON SONGS
AND THIEVES' RITOURNELLES ASSUMED SO TO SPEAK AN INSOLENT AND JOVIAL
MIEN
THE PLAINTIVE MALURE WAS REPLACED BY THE LARIFLA
WE FIND IN THE
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IN NEARLY ALL THE SONGS OF THE GALLEYS AND PRISONS
A DIABOLICAL AND ENIGMATICAL GAYETY
WE HEAR THIS STRIDENT AND LILTING
REFRAIN WHICH WE SHOULD SAY HAD BEEN LIGHTED UP BY A PHOSPHORESCENT
GLEAM AND WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FLUNG INTO THE FOREST BY A
WILL O' THE WISP PLAYING THE FIFE
MIRALABI SUSLABABO
MIRLITON RIBONRIBETTE
SURLABABI MIRLABABO
MIRLITON RIBONRIBO
THIS WAS SUNG IN A CELLAR OR IN A NOOK OF THE FOREST WHILE CUTTING A
MAN'S THROAT
A SERIOUS SYMPTOM
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE ANCIENT MELANCHOLY OF
THE DEJECTED CLASSES VANISHES
THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH
THEY RALLY THE GRAND
MEG AND THE GRAND DAB
GIVEN LOUIS XV
THEY CALL THE KING OF FRANCE LE
MARQUIS DE PANTIN AND BEHOLD THEY ARE ALMOST GAY
A SORT OF GLEAM
PROCEEDS FROM THESE MISERABLE WRETCHES AS THOUGH THEIR CONSCIENCES WERE
NOT HEAVY WITHIN THEM ANY MORE
THESE LAMENTABLE TRIBES OF DARKNESS HAVE
NO LONGER MERELY THE DESPERATE AUDACITY OF ACTIONS THEY POSSESS THE
HEEDLESS AUDACITY OF MIND
A SIGN THAT THEY ARE LOSING THE SENSE OF
THEIR CRIMINALITY AND THAT THEY FEEL EVEN AMONG THINKERS AND DREAMERS
SOME INDEFINABLE SUPPORT WHICH THE LATTER THEMSELVES KNOW NOT OF
A
SIGN THAT THEFT AND PILLAGE ARE BEGINNING TO FILTER INTO DOCTRINES AND
SOPHISMS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO LOSE SOMEWHAT OF THEIR UGLINESS WHILE
COMMUNICATING MUCH OF IT TO SOPHISMS AND DOCTRINES
A SIGN IN SHORT OF
SOME OUTBREAK WHICH IS PRODIGIOUS AND NEAR UNLESS SOME DIVERSION SHALL
ARISE
LET US PAUSE A MOMENT
WHOM ARE WE ACCUSING HERE IS IT THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY IS IT PHILOSOPHY CERTAINLY NOT
THE WORK OF THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY IS HEALTHY AND GOOD AND WHOLESOME
THE ENCYCLOPEDISTS DIDEROT
AT THEIR HEAD THE PHYSIOCRATES TURGOT AT THEIR HEAD THE PHILOSOPHERS
VOLTAIRE AT THEIR HEAD THE UTOPIANS ROUSSEAU AT THEIR HEAD THESE ARE
FOUR SACRED LEGIONS
HUMANITY'S IMMENSE ADVANCE TOWARDS THE LIGHT IS DUE
TO THEM
THEY ARE THE FOUR VANGUARDS OF THE HUMAN RACE MARCHING TOWARDS
THE FOUR CARDINAL POINTS OF PROGRESS
DIDEROT TOWARDS THE BEAUTIFUL
TURGOT TOWARDS THE USEFUL VOLTAIRE TOWARDS THE TRUE ROUSSEAU TOWARDS
THE JUST
BUT BY THE SIDE OF AND ABOVE THE PHILOSOPHERS THERE WERE THE
SOPHISTS A VENOMOUS VEGETATION MINGLED WITH A HEALTHY GROWTH HEMLOCK
IN THE VIRGIN FOREST
WHILE THE EXECUTIONER WAS BURNING THE GREAT
BOOKS OF THE LIBERATORS OF THE CENTURY ON THE GRAND STAIRCASE OF THE
COURT HOUSE WRITERS NOW FORGOTTEN WERE PUBLISHING WITH THE KING'S
SANCTION NO ONE KNOWS WHAT STRANGELY DISORGANIZING WRITINGS WHICH WERE
EAGERLY READ BY THE UNFORTUNATE
SOME OF THESE PUBLICATIONS ODD TO
SAY WHICH WERE PATRONIZED BY A PRINCE ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE SECRET
LIBRARY
THESE FACTS SIGNIFICANT BUT UNKNOWN WERE IMPERCEPTIBLE ON THE
SURFACE
SOMETIMES IN THE VERY OBSCURITY OF A FACT LURKS ITS DANGER
IT IS OBSCURE BECAUSE IT IS UNDERHAND
OF ALL THESE WRITERS THE ONE
WHO PROBABLY THEN EXCAVATED IN THE MASSES THE MOST UNHEALTHY GALLERY WAS
RESTIF DE LA BRETONNE
THIS WORK PECULIAR TO THE WHOLE OF EUROPE EFFECTED MORE RAVAGES IN
GERMANY THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
IN GERMANY DURING A GIVEN PERIOD SUMMED UP
BY SCHILLER IN HIS FAMOUS DRAMA THE ROBBERS THEFT AND PILLAGE ROSE UP
IN PROTEST AGAINST PROPERTY AND LABOR ASSIMILATED CERTAIN SPECIOUS AND
FALSE ELEMENTARY IDEAS WHICH THOUGH JUST IN APPEARANCE WERE ABSURD IN
REALITY ENVELOPED THEMSELVES IN THESE IDEAS DISAPPEARED WITHIN THEM
AFTER A FASHION ASSUMED AN ABSTRACT NAME PASSED INTO THE STATE OF
THEORY AND IN THAT SHAPE CIRCULATED AMONG THE LABORIOUS SUFFERING AND
HONEST MASSES UNKNOWN EVEN TO THE IMPRUDENT CHEMISTS WHO HAD PREPARED
THE MIXTURE UNKNOWN EVEN TO THE MASSES WHO ACCEPTED IT
WHENEVER A FACT
OF THIS SORT PRESENTS ITSELF THE CASE IS GRAVE
SUFFERING ENGENDERS
WRATH AND WHILE THE PROSPEROUS CLASSES BLIND THEMSELVES OR FALL ASLEEP
WHICH IS THE SAME THING AS SHUTTING ONE'S EYES THE HATRED OF THE
UNFORTUNATE CLASSES LIGHTS ITS TORCH AT SOME AGGRIEVED OR ILL MADE
SPIRIT WHICH DREAMS IN A CORNER AND SETS ITSELF TO THE SCRUTINY OF
SOCIETY
THE SCRUTINY OF HATRED IS A TERRIBLE THING
HENCE IF THE ILL FORTUNE OF THE TIMES SO WILLS IT THOSE FEARFUL
COMMOTIONS WHICH WERE FORMERLY CALLED JACQUERIES BESIDE WHICH PURELY
POLITICAL AGITATIONS ARE THE MEREST CHILD'S PLAY WHICH ARE NO LONGER
THE CONFLICT OF THE OPPRESSED AND THE OPPRESSOR BUT THE REVOLT OF
DISCOMFORT AGAINST COMFORT
THEN EVERYTHING CRUMBLES
JACQUERIES ARE EARTHQUAKES OF THE PEOPLE
IT IS THIS PERIL POSSIBLY IMMINENT TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY WHICH THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THAT IMMENSE ACT OF PROBITY CUT
SHORT
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION WHICH IS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE IDEA ARMED WITH
THE SWORD ROSE ERECT AND WITH THE SAME ABRUPT MOVEMENT CLOSED THE
DOOR OF ILL AND OPENED THE DOOR OF GOOD
IT PUT A STOP TO TORTURE PROMULGATED THE TRUTH EXPELLED MIASMA
RENDERED THE CENTURY HEALTHY CROWNED THE POPULACE
IT MAY BE SAID OF IT THAT IT CREATED MAN A SECOND TIME BY GIVING HIM A
SECOND SOUL THE RIGHT
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HAS INHERITED AND PROFITED BY ITS WORK AND
TO DAY THE SOCIAL CATASTROPHE TO WHICH WE LATELY ALLUDED IS SIMPLY
IMPOSSIBLE
BLIND IS HE WHO ANNOUNCES IT FOOLISH IS HE WHO FEARS IT
REVOLUTION IS THE VACCINE OF JACQUERIE
THANKS TO THE REVOLUTION SOCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED
FEUDAL AND
MONARCHICAL MALADIES NO LONGER RUN IN OUR BLOOD
THERE IS NO MORE OF
THE MIDDLE AGES IN OUR CONSTITUTION
WE NO LONGER LIVE IN THE DAYS WHEN
TERRIBLE SWARMS WITHIN MADE IRRUPTIONS WHEN ONE HEARD BENEATH HIS FEET
THE OBSCURE COURSE OF A DULL RUMBLE WHEN INDESCRIBABLE ELEVATIONS FROM
MOLE LIKE TUNNELS APPEARED ON THE SURFACE OF CIVILIZATION WHERE THE
SOIL CRACKED OPEN WHERE THE ROOFS OF CAVERNS YAWNED AND WHERE ONE
SUDDENLY BEHELD MONSTROUS HEADS EMERGING FROM THE EARTH
THE REVOLUTIONARY SENSE IS A MORAL SENSE
THE SENTIMENT OF RIGHT ONCE
DEVELOPED DEVELOPS THE SENTIMENT OF DUTY
THE LAW OF ALL IS
LIBERTY WHICH ENDS WHERE THE LIBERTY OF OTHERS BEGINS ACCORDING TO
ROBESPIERRE'S ADMIRABLE DEFINITION
SINCE '89 THE WHOLE PEOPLE HAS
BEEN DILATING INTO A SUBLIME INDIVIDUAL THERE IS NOT A POOR MAN WHO
POSSESSING HIS RIGHT HAS NOT HIS RAY OF SUN THE DIE OF HUNGER FEELS
WITHIN HIM THE HONESTY OF FRANCE THE DIGNITY OF THE CITIZEN IS AN
INTERNAL ARMOR HE WHO IS FREE IS SCRUPULOUS HE WHO VOTES REIGNS
HENCE
INCORRUPTIBILITY HENCE THE MISCARRIAGE OF UNHEALTHY LUSTS HENCE EYES
HEROICALLY LOWERED BEFORE TEMPTATIONS
THE REVOLUTIONARY WHOLESOMENESS
IS SUCH THAT ON A DAY OF DELIVERANCE A 14TH OF JULY A 10TH OF AUGUST
THERE IS NO LONGER ANY POPULACE
THE FIRST CRY OF THE ENLIGHTENED AND
INCREASING THRONGS IS DEATH TO THIEVES PROGRESS IS AN HONEST MAN THE
IDEAL AND THE ABSOLUTE DO NOT FILCH POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS
BY WHOM WERE
THE WAGONS CONTAINING THE WEALTH OF THE TUILERIES ESCORTED IN 1848 BY
THE RAG PICKERS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE
RAGS MOUNTED GUARD OVER
THE TREASURE
VIRTUE RENDERED THESE TATTERDEMALIONS RESPLENDENT
IN
THOSE WAGONS IN CHESTS HARDLY CLOSED AND SOME EVEN HALF OPEN AMID A
HUNDRED DAZZLING CASKETS WAS THAT ANCIENT CROWN OF FRANCE STUDDED WITH
DIAMONDS SURMOUNTED BY THE CARBUNCLE OF ROYALTY BY THE REGENT DIAMOND
WHICH WAS WORTH THIRTY MILLIONS
BAREFOOTED THEY GUARDED THAT CROWN
HENCE NO MORE JACQUERIE
I REGRET IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE SKILFUL
THE
OLD FEAR HAS PRODUCED ITS LAST EFFECTS IN THAT QUARTER AND HENCEFORTH
IT CAN NO LONGER BE EMPLOYED IN POLITICS
THE PRINCIPAL SPRING OF THE
RED SPECTRE IS BROKEN
EVERY ONE KNOWS IT NOW
THE SCARE CROW SCARES
NO LONGER
THE BIRDS TAKE LIBERTIES WITH THE MANNIKIN FOUL CREATURES
ALIGHT UPON IT THE BOURGEOIS LAUGH AT IT
CHAPTER IV THE TWO DUTIES TO WATCH AND TO HOPE
THIS BEING THE CASE IS ALL SOCIAL DANGER DISPELLED CERTAINLY NOT
THERE IS NO JACQUERIE SOCIETY MAY REST ASSURED ON THAT POINT BLOOD
WILL NO LONGER RUSH TO ITS HEAD
BUT LET SOCIETY TAKE HEED TO THE MANNER
IN WHICH IT BREATHES
APOPLEXY IS NO LONGER TO BE FEARED BUT PHTHISIS
IS THERE
SOCIAL PHTHISIS IS CALLED MISERY
ONE CAN PERISH FROM BEING UNDERMINED AS WELL AS FROM BEING STRUCK BY
LIGHTNING
LET US NOT WEARY OF REPEATING AND SYMPATHETIC SOULS MUST NOT FORGET
THAT THIS IS THE FIRST OF FRATERNAL OBLIGATIONS AND SELFISH HEARTS MUST
UNDERSTAND THAT THE FIRST OF POLITICAL NECESSITIES CONSISTS IN THINKING
FIRST OF ALL OF THE DISINHERITED AND SORROWING THRONGS IN SOLACING
AIRING ENLIGHTENING LOVING THEM IN ENLARGING THEIR HORIZON TO A
MAGNIFICENT EXTENT IN LAVISHING UPON THEM EDUCATION IN EVERY FORM IN
OFFERING THEM THE EXAMPLE OF LABOR NEVER THE EXAMPLE OF IDLENESS
IN DIMINISHING THE INDIVIDUAL BURDEN BY ENLARGING THE NOTION OF THE
UNIVERSAL AIM IN SETTING A LIMIT TO POVERTY WITHOUT SETTING A LIMIT
TO WEALTH IN CREATING VAST FIELDS OF PUBLIC AND POPULAR ACTIVITY IN
HAVING LIKE BRIAREUS A HUNDRED HANDS TO EXTEND IN ALL DIRECTIONS TO
THE OPPRESSED AND THE FEEBLE IN EMPLOYING THE COLLECTIVE POWER FOR THAT
GRAND DUTY OF OPENING WORKSHOPS FOR ALL ARMS SCHOOLS FOR ALL APTITUDES
AND LABORATORIES FOR ALL DEGREES OF INTELLIGENCE IN AUGMENTING
SALARIES DIMINISHING TROUBLE BALANCING WHAT SHOULD BE AND WHAT IS
THAT IS TO SAY IN PROPORTIONING ENJOYMENT TO EFFORT AND A GLUT TO NEED
IN A WORD IN EVOLVING FROM THE SOCIAL APPARATUS MORE LIGHT AND MORE
COMFORT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO SUFFER AND THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT
AND LET US SAY IT ALL THIS IS BUT THE BEGINNING
THE TRUE QUESTION IS
THIS LABOR CANNOT BE A LAW WITHOUT BEING A RIGHT
WE WILL NOT INSIST UPON THIS POINT THIS IS NOT THE PROPER PLACE FOR
THAT
IF NATURE CALLS ITSELF PROVIDENCE SOCIETY SHOULD CALL ITSELF FORESIGHT
INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL GROWTH IS NO LESS INDISPENSABLE THAN MATERIAL
IMPROVEMENT
TO KNOW IS A SACRAMENT TO THINK IS THE PRIME NECESSITY
TRUTH IS NOURISHMENT AS WELL AS GRAIN
A REASON WHICH FASTS FROM SCIENCE
AND WISDOM GROWS THIN
LET US ENTER EQUAL COMPLAINT AGAINST STOMACHS AND
MINDS WHICH DO NOT EAT
IF THERE IS ANYTHING MORE HEART BREAKING THAN
A BODY PERISHING FOR LACK OF BREAD IT IS A SOUL WHICH IS DYING FROM
HUNGER FOR THE LIGHT
THE WHOLE OF PROGRESS TENDS IN THE DIRECTION OF SOLUTION
SOME DAY WE
SHALL BE AMAZED
AS THE HUMAN RACE MOUNTS UPWARD THE DEEP LAYERS EMERGE
NATURALLY FROM THE ZONE OF DISTRESS
THE OBLITERATION OF MISERY WILL BE
ACCOMPLISHED BY A SIMPLE ELEVATION OF LEVEL
WE SHOULD DO WRONG WERE WE TO DOUBT THIS BLESSED CONSUMMATION
THE PAST IS VERY STRONG IT IS TRUE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
IT CENSURES
THIS REJUVENATION OF A CORPSE IS SURPRISING
BEHOLD IT IS WALKING AND
ADVANCING
IT SEEMS A VICTOR THIS DEAD BODY IS A CONQUEROR
HE ARRIVES
WITH HIS LEGIONS SUPERSTITIONS WITH HIS SWORD DESPOTISM WITH HIS
BANNER IGNORANCE A WHILE AGO HE WON TEN BATTLES
HE ADVANCES HE
THREATENS HE LAUGHS HE IS AT OUR DOORS
LET US NOT DESPAIR ON OUR
SIDE
LET US SELL THE FIELD ON WHICH HANNIBAL IS ENCAMPED
WHAT HAVE WE TO FEAR WE WHO BELIEVE
NO SUCH THING AS A BACK FLOW OF IDEAS EXISTS ANY MORE THAN THERE EXISTS
A RETURN OF A RIVER ON ITS COURSE
BUT LET THOSE WHO DO NOT DESIRE A FUTURE REFLECT ON THIS MATTER
WHEN
THEY SAY NO TO PROGRESS IT IS NOT THE FUTURE BUT THEMSELVES THAT
THEY ARE CONDEMNING
THEY ARE GIVING THEMSELVES A SAD MALADY THEY ARE
INOCULATING THEMSELVES WITH THE PAST
THERE IS BUT ONE WAY OF REJECTING
TO MORROW AND THAT IS TO DIE
NOW NO DEATH THAT OF THE BODY AS LATE AS POSSIBLE THAT OF THE SOUL
NEVER THIS IS WHAT WE DESIRE
YES THE ENIGMA WILL UTTER ITS WORD THE SPHINX WILL SPEAK THE PROBLEM
WILL BE SOLVED
YES THE PEOPLE SKETCHED OUT BY THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WILL BE
FINISHED BY THE NINETEENTH
HE WHO DOUBTS THIS IS AN IDIOT THE FUTURE
BLOSSOMING THE NEAR BLOSSOMING FORTH OF UNIVERSAL WELL BEING IS A
DIVINELY FATAL PHENOMENON
IMMENSE COMBINED PROPULSIONS DIRECT HUMAN AFFAIRS AND CONDUCT THEM
WITHIN A GIVEN TIME TO A LOGICAL STATE THAT IS TO SAY TO A STATE OF
EQUILIBRIUM THAT IS TO SAY TO EQUITY
A FORCE COMPOSED OF EARTH AND
HEAVEN RESULTS FROM HUMANITY AND GOVERNS IT THIS FORCE IS A WORKER
OF MIRACLES MARVELLOUS ISSUES ARE NO MORE DIFFICULT TO IT THAN
EXTRAORDINARY VICISSITUDES
AIDED BY SCIENCE WHICH COMES FROM ONE MAN
AND BY THE EVENT WHICH COMES FROM ANOTHER IT IS NOT GREATLY ALARMED
BY THESE CONTRADICTIONS IN THE ATTITUDE OF PROBLEMS WHICH SEEM
IMPOSSIBILITIES TO THE VULGAR HERD
IT IS NO LESS SKILFUL AT CAUSING A
SOLUTION TO SPRING FORTH FROM THE RECONCILIATION OF IDEAS THAN A LESSON
FROM THE RECONCILIATION OF FACTS AND WE MAY EXPECT ANYTHING FROM THAT
MYSTERIOUS POWER OF PROGRESS WHICH BROUGHT THE ORIENT AND THE OCCIDENT
FACE TO FACE ONE FINE DAY IN THE DEPTHS OF A SEPULCHRE AND MADE THE
IMAUMS CONVERSE WITH BONAPARTE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE GREAT PYRAMID
IN THE MEANTIME LET THERE BE NO HALT NO HESITATION NO PAUSE IN THE
GRANDIOSE ONWARD MARCH OF MINDS
SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY CONSISTS ESSENTIALLY
IN SCIENCE AND PEACE
ITS OBJECT IS AND ITS RESULT MUST BE TO DISSOLVE
WRATH BY THE STUDY OF ANTAGONISMS
IT EXAMINES IT SCRUTINIZES IT
ANALYZES THEN IT PUTS TOGETHER ONCE MORE IT PROCEEDS BY MEANS OF
REDUCTION DISCARDING ALL HATRED
MORE THAN ONCE A SOCIETY HAS BEEN SEEN TO GIVE WAY BEFORE THE WIND
WHICH IS LET LOOSE UPON MANKIND HISTORY IS FULL OF THE SHIPWRECKS OF
NATIONS AND EMPIRES MANNERS CUSTOMS LAWS RELIGIONS AND SOME FINE
DAY THAT UNKNOWN FORCE THE HURRICANE PASSES BY AND BEARS THEM ALL
AWAY
THE CIVILIZATIONS OF INDIA OF CHALDEA OF PERSIA OF SYRIA OF
EGYPT HAVE DISAPPEARED ONE AFTER THE OTHER
WHY WE KNOW NOT
WHAT ARE
THE CAUSES OF THESE DISASTERS WE DO NOT KNOW
COULD THESE SOCIETIES
HAVE BEEN SAVED WAS IT THEIR FAULT DID THEY PERSIST IN THE FATAL VICE
WHICH DESTROYED THEM WHAT IS THE AMOUNT OF SUICIDE IN THESE TERRIBLE
DEATHS OF A NATION AND A RACE QUESTIONS TO WHICH THERE EXISTS NO REPLY
DARKNESS ENWRAPS CONDEMNED CIVILIZATIONS
THEY SPRUNG A LEAK THEN THEY
SANK
WE HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY AND IT IS WITH A SORT OF TERROR THAT
WE LOOK ON AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT SEA WHICH IS CALLED THE PAST BEHIND
THOSE COLOSSAL WAVES AT THE SHIPWRECK OF THOSE IMMENSE VESSELS
BABYLON NINEVEH TARSUS THEBES ROME BENEATH THE FEARFUL GUSTS WHICH
EMERGE FROM ALL THE MOUTHS OF THE SHADOWS
BUT SHADOWS ARE THERE AND
LIGHT IS HERE
WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE MALADIES OF THESE ANCIENT
CIVILIZATIONS WE DO NOT KNOW THE INFIRMITIES OF OUR OWN
EVERYWHERE
UPON IT WE HAVE THE RIGHT OF LIGHT WE CONTEMPLATE ITS BEAUTIES WE
LAY BARE ITS DEFECTS
WHERE IT IS ILL WE PROBE AND THE SICKNESS ONCE
DIAGNOSED THE STUDY OF THE CAUSE LEADS TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE REMEDY
OUR CIVILIZATION THE WORK OF TWENTY CENTURIES IS ITS LAW AND ITS
PRODIGY IT IS WORTH THE TROUBLE OF SAVING
IT WILL BE SAVED
IT IS
ALREADY MUCH TO HAVE SOLACED IT ITS ENLIGHTENMENT IS YET ANOTHER POINT
ALL THE LABORS OF MODERN SOCIAL PHILOSOPHIES MUST CONVERGE TOWARDS
THIS POINT
THE THINKER OF TO DAY HAS A GREAT DUTY TO AUSCULTATE
CIVILIZATION
WE REPEAT THAT THIS AUSCULTATION BRINGS ENCOURAGEMENT IT IS BY THIS
PERSISTENCE IN ENCOURAGEMENT THAT WE WISH TO CONCLUDE THESE PAGES AN
AUSTERE INTERLUDE IN A MOURNFUL DRAMA
BENEATH THE SOCIAL MORTALITY WE
FEEL HUMAN IMPERISHABLENESS
THE GLOBE DOES NOT PERISH BECAUSE IT HAS
THESE WOUNDS CRATERS ERUPTIONS SULPHUR PITS HERE AND THERE NOR
BECAUSE OF A VOLCANO WHICH EJECTS ITS PUS
THE MALADIES OF THE PEOPLE DO
NOT KILL MAN
AND YET ANY ONE WHO FOLLOWS THE COURSE OF SOCIAL CLINICS SHAKES HIS
HEAD AT TIMES
THE STRONGEST THE TENDEREST THE MOST LOGICAL HAVE THEIR
HOURS OF WEAKNESS
WILL THE FUTURE ARRIVE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE MIGHT ALMOST PUT
THIS QUESTION WHEN WE BEHOLD SO MUCH TERRIBLE DARKNESS
MELANCHOLY
FACE TO FACE ENCOUNTER OF SELFISH AND WRETCHED
ON THE PART OF
THE SELFISH THE PREJUDICES SHADOWS OF COSTLY EDUCATION APPETITE
INCREASING THROUGH INTOXICATION A GIDDINESS OF PROSPERITY WHICH DULLS
A FEAR OF SUFFERING WHICH IN SOME GOES AS FAR AS AN AVERSION FOR THE
SUFFERING AN IMPLACABLE SATISFACTION THE I SO SWOLLEN THAT IT BARS THE
SOUL ON THE SIDE OF THE WRETCHED COVETOUSNESS ENVY HATRED OF SEEING
OTHERS ENJOY THE PROFOUND IMPULSES OF THE HUMAN BEAST TOWARDS ASSUAGING
ITS DESIRES HEARTS FULL OF MIST SADNESS NEED FATALITY IMPURE AND
SIMPLE IGNORANCE
SHALL WE CONTINUE TO RAISE OUR EYES TO HEAVEN IS THE LUMINOUS POINT
WHICH WE DISTINGUISH THERE ONE OF THOSE WHICH VANISH THE IDEAL
IS FRIGHTFUL TO BEHOLD THUS LOST IN THE DEPTHS SMALL ISOLATED
IMPERCEPTIBLE BRILLIANT BUT SURROUNDED BY THOSE GREAT BLACK MENACES
MONSTROUSLY HEAPED AROUND IT YET NO MORE IN DANGER THAN A STAR IN THE
MAW OF THE CLOUDS
BOOK EIGHTH ENCHANTMENTS AND DESOLATIONS
CHAPTER I FULL LIGHT
THE READER HAS PROBABLY UNDERSTOOD THAT EPONINE HAVING RECOGNIZED
THROUGH THE GATE THE INHABITANT OF THAT RUE PLUMET WHITHER MAGNON HAD
SENT HER HAD BEGUN BY KEEPING THE RUFFIANS AWAY FROM THE RUE PLUMET
AND HAD THEN CONDUCTED MARIUS THITHER AND THAT AFTER MANY DAYS SPENT
IN ECSTASY BEFORE THAT GATE MARIUS DRAWN ON BY THAT FORCE WHICH DRAWS
THE IRON TO THE MAGNET AND A LOVER TOWARDS THE STONES OF WHICH IS BUILT
THE HOUSE OF HER WHOM HE LOVES HAD FINALLY ENTERED COSETTE'S GARDEN AS
ROMEO ENTERED THE GARDEN OF JULIET
THIS HAD EVEN PROVED EASIER FOR HIM
THAN FOR ROMEO ROMEO WAS OBLIGED TO SCALE A WALL MARIUS HAD ONLY
TO USE A LITTLE FORCE ON ONE OF THE BARS OF THE DECREPIT GATE WHICH
VACILLATED IN ITS RUSTY RECESS AFTER THE FASHION OF OLD PEOPLE'S TEETH
MARIUS WAS SLENDER AND READILY PASSED THROUGH
AS THERE WAS NEVER ANY ONE IN THE STREET AND AS MARIUS NEVER ENTERED
THE GARDEN EXCEPT AT NIGHT HE RAN NO RISK OF BEING SEEN
BEGINNING WITH THAT BLESSED AND HOLY HOUR WHEN A KISS BETROTHED THESE
TWO SOULS MARIUS WAS THERE EVERY EVENING
IF AT THAT PERIOD OF
HER EXISTENCE COSETTE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A MAN IN THE LEAST
UNSCRUPULOUS OR DEBAUCHED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST FOR THERE ARE
GENEROUS NATURES WHICH YIELD THEMSELVES AND COSETTE WAS ONE OF THEM
ONE OF WOMAN'S MAGNANIMITIES IS TO YIELD
LOVE AT THE HEIGHT WHERE IT
IS ABSOLUTE IS COMPLICATED WITH SOME INDESCRIBABLY CELESTIAL BLINDNESS
OF MODESTY
BUT WHAT DANGERS YOU RUN O NOBLE SOULS OFTEN YOU GIVE THE
HEART AND WE TAKE THE BODY
YOUR HEART REMAINS WITH YOU YOU GAZE UPON
IT IN THE GLOOM WITH A SHUDDER
LOVE HAS NO MIDDLE COURSE IT EITHER
RUINS OR IT SAVES
ALL HUMAN DESTINY LIES IN THIS DILEMMA
THIS DILEMMA
RUIN OR SAFETY IS SET FORTH NO MORE INEXORABLY BY ANY FATALITY THAN
BY LOVE
LOVE IS LIFE IF IT IS NOT DEATH
CRADLE ALSO COFFIN
THE SAME
SENTIMENT SAYS YES AND NO IN THE HUMAN HEART
OF ALL THE THINGS THAT
GOD HAS MADE THE HUMAN HEART IS THE ONE WHICH SHEDS THE MOST LIGHT
ALAS AND THE MOST DARKNESS
GOD WILLED THAT COSETTE'S LOVE SHOULD ENCOUNTER ONE OF THE LOVES WHICH
SAVE
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THE MONTH OF MAY OF THAT YEAR 1832 THERE WERE
THERE IN EVERY NIGHT IN THAT POOR NEGLECTED GARDEN BENEATH THAT
THICKET WHICH GREW THICKER AND MORE FRAGRANT DAY BY DAY TWO BEINGS
COMPOSED OF ALL CHASTITY ALL INNOCENCE OVERFLOWING WITH ALL THE
FELICITY OF HEAVEN NEARER TO THE ARCHANGELS THAN TO MANKIND PURE
HONEST INTOXICATED RADIANT WHO SHONE FOR EACH OTHER AMID THE SHADOWS
IT SEEMED TO COSETTE THAT MARIUS HAD A CROWN AND TO MARIUS THAT COSETTE
HAD A NIMBUS
THEY TOUCHED EACH OTHER THEY GAZED AT EACH OTHER THEY
CLASPED EACH OTHER'S HANDS THEY PRESSED CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BUT THERE
WAS A DISTANCE WHICH THEY DID NOT PASS
NOT THAT THEY RESPECTED IT
THEY DID NOT KNOW OF ITS EXISTENCE
MARIUS WAS CONSCIOUS OF A BARRIER
COSETTE'S INNOCENCE AND COSETTE OF A SUPPORT MARIUS' LOYALTY
THE
FIRST KISS HAD ALSO BEEN THE LAST
MARIUS SINCE THAT TIME HAD NOT GONE
FURTHER THAN TO TOUCH COSETTE'S HAND OR HER KERCHIEF OR A LOCK OF HER
HAIR WITH HIS LIPS
FOR HIM COSETTE WAS A PERFUME AND NOT A WOMAN
HE INHALED HER
SHE REFUSED NOTHING AND HE ASKED NOTHING
COSETTE WAS
HAPPY AND MARIUS WAS SATISFIED
THEY LIVED IN THIS ECSTATIC STATE WHICH
CAN BE DESCRIBED AS THE DAZZLING OF ONE SOUL BY ANOTHER SOUL
IT WAS
THE INEFFABLE FIRST EMBRACE OF TWO MAIDEN SOULS IN THE IDEAL
TWO SWANS
MEETING ON THE JUNGFRAU
AT THAT HOUR OF LOVE AN HOUR WHEN VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS ABSOLUTELY MUTE
BENEATH THE OMNIPOTENCE OF ECSTASY MARIUS THE PURE AND SERAPHIC
MARIUS WOULD RATHER HAVE GONE TO A WOMAN OF THE TOWN THAN HAVE RAISED
COSETTE'S ROBE TO THE HEIGHT OF HER ANKLE
ONCE IN THE MOONLIGHT
COSETTE STOOPED TO PICK UP SOMETHING ON THE GROUND HER BODICE FELL
APART AND PERMITTED A GLIMPSE OF THE BEGINNING OF HER THROAT
MARIUS
TURNED AWAY HIS EYES
WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THESE TWO BEINGS NOTHING
THEY ADORED EACH
OTHER
AT NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE THERE THAT GARDEN SEEMED A LIVING AND A SACRED
SPOT
ALL FLOWERS UNFOLDED AROUND THEM AND SENT THEM INCENSE AND THEY
OPENED THEIR SOULS AND SCATTERED THEM OVER THE FLOWERS
THE WANTON AND
VIGOROUS VEGETATION QUIVERED FULL OF STRENGTH AND INTOXICATION AROUND
THESE TWO INNOCENTS AND THEY UTTERED WORDS OF LOVE WHICH SET THE TREES
TO TREMBLING
WHAT WORDS WERE THESE BREATHS
NOTHING MORE
THESE BREATHS SUFFICED TO
TROUBLE AND TO TOUCH ALL NATURE ROUND ABOUT
MAGIC POWER WHICH WE
SHOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WERE WE TO READ IN A BOOK THESE
CONVERSATIONS WHICH ARE MADE TO BE BORNE AWAY AND DISPERSED LIKE SMOKE
WREATHS BY THE BREEZE BENEATH THE LEAVES
TAKE FROM THOSE MURMURS OF TWO
LOVERS THAT MELODY WHICH PROCEEDS FROM THE SOUL AND WHICH ACCOMPANIES
THEM LIKE A LYRE AND WHAT REMAINS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SHADE YOU
SAY WHAT IS THAT ALL EH YES CHILDISH PRATTLE REPETITIONS
LAUGHTER AT NOTHING NONSENSE EVERYTHING THAT IS DEEPEST AND MOST
SUBLIME IN THE WORLD THE ONLY THINGS WHICH ARE WORTH THE TROUBLE OF
SAYING AND HEARING
THE MAN WHO HAS NEVER HEARD THE MAN WHO HAS NEVER UTTERED THESE
ABSURDITIES THESE PALTRY REMARKS IS AN IMBECILE AND A MALICIOUS
FELLOW
COSETTE SAID TO MARIUS
DOST THOU KNOW
IN ALL THIS AND ATHWART THIS CELESTIAL MAIDENLINESS AND WITHOUT EITHER
OF THEM BEING ABLE TO SAY HOW IT HAD COME ABOUT THEY HAD BEGUN TO CALL
EACH OTHER THOU
DOST THOU KNOW MY NAME IS EUPHRASIE
EUPHRASIE WHY NO THY NAME IS COSETTE
OH COSETTE IS A VERY UGLY NAME THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE THING
BUT MY REAL NAME IS EUPHRASIE
DOST THOU LIKE THAT
NAME EUPHRASIE
YES
BUT COSETTE IS NOT UGLY
DO YOU LIKE IT BETTER THAN EUPHRASIE
WHY YES
THEN I LIKE IT BETTER TOO
TRULY IT IS PRETTY COSETTE
CALL ME
COSETTE
AND THE SMILE THAT SHE ADDED MADE OF THIS DIALOGUE AN IDYL WORTHY OF A
GROVE SITUATED IN HEAVEN
ON ANOTHER OCCASION SHE GAZED INTENTLY AT HIM
AND EXCLAIMED
MONSIEUR YOU ARE HANDSOME YOU ARE GOOD LOOKING YOU ARE WITTY YOU
ARE NOT AT ALL STUPID YOU ARE MUCH MORE LEARNED THAN I AM BUT I BID
YOU DEFIANCE WITH THIS WORD I LOVE YOU
AND MARIUS IN THE VERY HEAVENS THOUGHT HE HEARD A STRAIN SUNG BY A
STAR
OR SHE BESTOWED ON HIM A GENTLE TAP BECAUSE HE COUGHED AND SHE SAID TO
HIM
DON'T COUGH SIR I WILL NOT HAVE PEOPLE COUGH ON MY DOMAIN WITHOUT MY
PERMISSION
IT'S VERY NAUGHTY TO COUGH AND TO DISTURB ME
I WANT YOU TO
BE WELL BECAUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE IF YOU WERE NOT WELL I SHOULD BE
VERY UNHAPPY
WHAT SHOULD I DO THEN
AND THIS WAS SIMPLY DIVINE
ONCE MARIUS SAID TO COSETTE
JUST IMAGINE I THOUGHT AT ONE TIME THAT YOUR NAME WAS URSULE
THIS MADE BOTH OF THEM LAUGH THE WHOLE EVENING
IN THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER CONVERSATION HE CHANCED TO EXCLAIM
OH ONE DAY AT THE LUXEMBOURG I HAD A GOOD MIND TO FINISH BREAKING
UP A VETERAN BUT HE STOPPED SHORT AND WENT NO FURTHER
HE WOULD HAVE
BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK TO COSETTE OF HER GARTER AND THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THIS BORDERED ON A STRANGE THEME THE FLESH BEFORE WHICH THAT IMMENSE
AND INNOCENT LOVE RECOILED WITH A SORT OF SACRED FRIGHT
MARIUS PICTURED LIFE WITH COSETTE TO HIMSELF LIKE THIS WITHOUT ANYTHING
ELSE TO COME EVERY EVENING TO THE RUE PLUMET TO DISPLACE THE OLD AND
ACCOMMODATING BAR OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S GATE TO SIT ELBOW TO ELBOW
ON THAT BENCH TO GAZE THROUGH THE TREES AT THE SCINTILLATION OF THE
ON COMING NIGHT TO FIT A FOLD OF THE KNEE OF HIS TROUSERS INTO THE
AMPLE FALL OF COSETTE'S GOWN TO CARESS HER THUMB NAIL TO CALL HER
THOU TO SMELL OF THE SAME FLOWER ONE AFTER THE OTHER FOREVER
INDEFINITELY
DURING THIS TIME CLOUDS PASSED ABOVE THEIR HEADS
EVERY
TIME THAT THE WIND BLOWS IT BEARS WITH IT MORE OF THE DREAMS OF MEN THAN
OF THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN
THIS CHASTE ALMOST SHY LOVE WAS NOT DEVOID OF GALLANTRY BY ANY MEANS
TO PAY COMPLIMENTS TO THE WOMAN WHOM A MAN LOVES IS THE FIRST METHOD OF
BESTOWING CARESSES AND HE IS HALF AUDACIOUS WHO TRIES IT
A COMPLIMENT
IS SOMETHING LIKE A KISS THROUGH A VEIL
VOLUPTUOUSNESS MINGLES THERE
WITH ITS SWEET TINY POINT WHILE IT HIDES ITSELF
THE HEART DRAWS BACK
BEFORE VOLUPTUOUSNESS ONLY TO LOVE THE MORE
MARIUS' BLANDISHMENTS ALL
SATURATED WITH FANCY WERE SO TO SPEAK OF AZURE HUE
THE BIRDS WHEN
THEY FLY UP YONDER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ANGELS MUST HEAR SUCH
WORDS
THERE WERE MINGLED WITH THEM NEVERTHELESS LIFE HUMANITY ALL
THE POSITIVENESS OF WHICH MARIUS WAS CAPABLE
IT WAS WHAT IS SAID IN
THE BOWER A PRELUDE TO WHAT WILL BE SAID IN THE CHAMBER A LYRICAL
EFFUSION STROPHE AND SONNET INTERMINGLED PLEASING HYPERBOLES OF
COOING ALL THE REFINEMENTS OF ADORATION ARRANGED IN A BOUQUET AND
EXHALING A CELESTIAL PERFUME AN INEFFABLE TWITTER OF HEART TO HEART
OH MURMURED MARIUS HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE I DARE NOT LOOK AT YOU
IT IS ALL OVER WITH ME WHEN I CONTEMPLATE YOU
YOU ARE A GRACE
I KNOW
NOT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME
THE HEM OF YOUR GOWN WHEN THE TIP OF
YOUR SHOE PEEPS FROM BENEATH UPSETS ME
AND THEN WHAT AN ENCHANTED
GLEAM WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR THOUGHT EVEN BUT A LITTLE YOU TALK
ASTONISHINGLY GOOD SENSE
IT SEEMS TO ME AT TIMES THAT YOU ARE A
DREAM
SPEAK I LISTEN I ADMIRE
OH COSETTE HOW STRANGE IT IS AND HOW
CHARMING I AM REALLY BESIDE MYSELF
YOU ARE ADORABLE MADEMOISELLE
I
STUDY YOUR FEET WITH THE MICROSCOPE AND YOUR SOUL WITH THE TELESCOPE
AND COSETTE ANSWERED
I HAVE BEEN LOVING A LITTLE MORE ALL THE TIME THAT HAS PASSED SINCE
THIS MORNING
QUESTIONS AND REPLIES TOOK CARE OF THEMSELVES IN THIS DIALOGUE WHICH
ALWAYS TURNED WITH MUTUAL CONSENT UPON LOVE AS THE LITTLE PITH FIGURES
ALWAYS TURN ON THEIR PEG
COSETTE'S WHOLE PERSON WAS INGENUOUSNESS INGENUITY TRANSPARENCY
WHITENESS CANDOR RADIANCE
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID OF COSETTE THAT SHE
WAS CLEAR
SHE PRODUCED ON THOSE WHO SAW HER THE SENSATION OF APRIL
AND DAWN
THERE WAS DEW IN HER EYES
COSETTE WAS A CONDENSATION OF THE
AURORAL LIGHT IN THE FORM OF A WOMAN
IT WAS QUITE SIMPLE THAT MARIUS SHOULD ADMIRE HER SINCE HE ADORED HER
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS LITTLE SCHOOL GIRL FRESH FROM THE CONVENT
TALKED WITH EXQUISITE PENETRATION AND UTTERED AT TIMES ALL SORTS OF
TRUE AND DELICATE SAYINGS
HER PRATTLE WAS CONVERSATION
SHE NEVER MADE
A MISTAKE ABOUT ANYTHING AND SHE SAW THINGS JUSTLY
THE WOMAN FEELS AND
SPEAKS WITH THE TENDER INSTINCT OF THE HEART WHICH IS INFALLIBLE
NO ONE UNDERSTANDS SO WELL AS A WOMAN HOW TO SAY THINGS THAT ARE AT
ONCE BOTH SWEET AND DEEP
SWEETNESS AND DEPTH THEY ARE THE WHOLE OF
WOMAN IN THEM LIES THE WHOLE OF HEAVEN
IN THIS FULL FELICITY TEARS WELLED UP TO THEIR EYES EVERY INSTANT
A
CRUSHED LADY BUG A FEATHER FALLEN FROM A NEST A BRANCH OF HAWTHORN
BROKEN AROUSED THEIR PITY AND THEIR ECSTASY SWEETLY MINGLED WITH
MELANCHOLY SEEMED TO ASK NOTHING BETTER THAN TO WEEP
THE MOST
SOVEREIGN SYMPTOM OF LOVE IS A TENDERNESS THAT IS AT TIMES ALMOST
UNBEARABLE
AND IN ADDITION TO THIS ALL THESE CONTRADICTIONS ARE THE LIGHTNING
PLAY OF LOVE THEY WERE FOND OF LAUGHING THEY LAUGHED READILY AND WITH
A DELICIOUS FREEDOM AND SO FAMILIARLY THAT THEY SOMETIMES PRESENTED THE
AIR OF TWO BOYS
STILL THOUGH UNKNOWN TO HEARTS INTOXICATED WITH PURITY NATURE IS
ALWAYS PRESENT AND WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN
SHE IS THERE WITH HER BRUTAL
AND SUBLIME OBJECT AND HOWEVER GREAT MAY BE THE INNOCENCE OF SOULS ONE
FEELS IN THE MOST MODEST PRIVATE INTERVIEW THE ADORABLE AND MYSTERIOUS
SHADE WHICH SEPARATES A COUPLE OF LOVERS FROM A PAIR OF FRIENDS
THEY IDOLIZED EACH OTHER
THE PERMANENT AND THE IMMUTABLE ARE PERSISTENT
PEOPLE LIVE THEY SMILE
THEY LAUGH THEY MAKE LITTLE GRIMACES WITH THE TIPS OF THEIR LIPS THEY
INTERLACE THEIR FINGERS THEY CALL EACH OTHER THOU AND THAT DOES NOT
PREVENT ETERNITY
TWO LOVERS HIDE THEMSELVES IN THE EVENING IN THE TWILIGHT IN THE
INVISIBLE WITH THE BIRDS WITH THE ROSES THEY FASCINATE EACH OTHER IN
THE DARKNESS WITH THEIR HEARTS WHICH THEY THROW INTO THEIR EYES THEY
MURMUR THEY WHISPER AND IN THE MEANTIME IMMENSE LIBRATIONS OF THE
PLANETS FILL THE INFINITE UNIVERSE
CHAPTER II THE BEWILDERMENT OF PERFECT HAPPINESS
THEY EXISTED VAGUELY FRIGHTENED AT THEIR HAPPINESS
THEY DID NOT NOTICE
THE CHOLERA WHICH DECIMATED PARIS PRECISELY DURING THAT VERY MONTH
THEY
HAD CONFIDED IN EACH OTHER AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BUT THIS HAD NOT EXTENDED
MUCH FURTHER THAN THEIR NAMES
MARIUS HAD TOLD COSETTE THAT HE WAS AN
ORPHAN THAT HIS NAME WAS MARIUS PONTMERCY THAT HE WAS A LAWYER THAT
HE LIVED BY WRITING THINGS FOR PUBLISHERS THAT HIS FATHER HAD BEEN A
COLONEL THAT THE LATTER HAD BEEN A HERO AND THAT HE MARIUS WAS ON
BAD TERMS WITH HIS GRANDFATHER WHO WAS RICH
HE HAD ALSO HINTED AT BEING
A BARON BUT THIS HAD PRODUCED NO EFFECT ON COSETTE
SHE DID NOT
KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD
MARIUS WAS MARIUS
ON HER SIDE SHE
HAD CONFIDED TO HIM THAT SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP AT THE PETIT PICPUS
CONVENT THAT HER MOTHER LIKE HIS OWN WAS DEAD THAT HER FATHER'S NAME
WAS M
FAUCHELEVENT THAT HE WAS VERY GOOD THAT HE GAVE A GREAT DEAL
TO THE POOR BUT THAT HE WAS POOR HIMSELF AND THAT HE DENIED HIMSELF
EVERYTHING THOUGH HE DENIED HER NOTHING
STRANGE TO SAY IN THE SORT OF SYMPHONY WHICH MARIUS HAD LIVED SINCE HE
HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SEEING COSETTE THE PAST EVEN THE MOST RECENT
PAST HAD BECOME SO CONFUSED AND DISTANT TO HIM THAT WHAT COSETTE TOLD
HIM SATISFIED HIM COMPLETELY
IT DID NOT EVEN OCCUR TO HIM TO TELL HER
ABOUT THE NOCTURNAL ADVENTURE IN THE HOVEL ABOUT THENARDIER ABOUT THE
BURN AND ABOUT THE STRANGE ATTITUDE AND SINGULAR FLIGHT OF HER FATHER
MARIUS HAD MOMENTARILY FORGOTTEN ALL THIS IN THE EVENING HE DID NOT
EVEN KNOW THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MORNING WHAT HE HAD DONE WHERE HE HAD
BREAKFASTED NOR WHO HAD SPOKEN TO HIM HE HAD SONGS IN HIS EARS WHICH
RENDERED HIM DEAF TO EVERY OTHER THOUGHT HE ONLY EXISTED AT THE HOURS
WHEN HE SAW COSETTE
THEN AS HE WAS IN HEAVEN IT WAS QUITE NATURAL
THAT HE SHOULD FORGET EARTH
BOTH BORE LANGUIDLY THE INDEFINABLE BURDEN
OF IMMATERIAL PLEASURES
THUS LIVED THESE SOMNAMBULISTS WHO ARE CALLED
LOVERS
ALAS WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT FELT ALL THESE THINGS WHY DOES THERE
COME AN HOUR WHEN ONE EMERGES FROM THIS AZURE AND WHY DOES LIFE GO ON
AFTERWARDS
LOVING ALMOST TAKES THE PLACE OF THINKING
LOVE IS AN ARDENT
FORGETFULNESS OF ALL THE REST
THEN ASK LOGIC OF PASSION IF YOU WILL
THERE IS NO MORE ABSOLUTE LOGICAL SEQUENCE IN THE HUMAN HEART THAN THERE
IS A PERFECT GEOMETRICAL FIGURE IN THE CELESTIAL MECHANISM
FOR COSETTE
AND MARIUS NOTHING EXISTED EXCEPT MARIUS AND COSETTE
THE UNIVERSE
AROUND THEM HAD FALLEN INTO A HOLE
THEY LIVED IN A GOLDEN MINUTE
THERE
WAS NOTHING BEFORE THEM NOTHING BEHIND
IT HARDLY OCCURRED TO MARIUS
THAT COSETTE HAD A FATHER
HIS BRAIN WAS DAZZLED AND OBLITERATED
OF
WHAT DID THESE LOVERS TALK THEN WE HAVE SEEN OF THE FLOWERS AND
THE SWALLOWS THE SETTING SUN AND THE RISING MOON AND ALL SORTS OF
IMPORTANT THINGS
THEY HAD TOLD EACH OTHER EVERYTHING EXCEPT EVERYTHING
THE EVERYTHING OF LOVERS IS NOTHING
BUT THE FATHER THE REALITIES THAT
LAIR THE RUFFIANS THAT ADVENTURE TO WHAT PURPOSE AND WAS HE VERY
SURE THAT THIS NIGHTMARE HAD ACTUALLY EXISTED THEY WERE TWO AND THEY
ADORED EACH OTHER AND BEYOND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING
NOTHING ELSE
EXISTED
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS VANISHING OF HELL IN OUR REAR IS
INHERENT TO THE ARRIVAL OF PARADISE
HAVE WE BEHELD DEMONS ARE THERE
ANY HAVE WE TREMBLED HAVE WE SUFFERED WE NO LONGER KNOW
A ROSY CLOUD
HANGS OVER IT
SO THESE TWO BEINGS LIVED IN THIS MANNER HIGH ALOFT WITH ALL THAT
IMPROBABILITY WHICH IS IN NATURE NEITHER AT THE NADIR NOR AT THE
ZENITH BETWEEN MAN AND SERAPHIM ABOVE THE MIRE BELOW THE ETHER IN
THE CLOUDS HARDLY FLESH AND BLOOD SOUL AND ECSTASY FROM HEAD TO FOOT
ALREADY TOO SUBLIME TO WALK THE EARTH STILL TOO HEAVILY CHARGED WITH
HUMANITY TO DISAPPEAR IN THE BLUE SUSPENDED LIKE ATOMS WHICH ARE
WAITING TO BE PRECIPITATED APPARENTLY BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF DESTINY
IGNORANT OF THAT RUT YESTERDAY TO DAY TO MORROW AMAZED RAPTUROUS
FLOATING SOARING AT TIMES SO LIGHT THAT THEY COULD TAKE THEIR FLIGHT
OUT INTO THE INFINITE ALMOST PREPARED TO SOAR AWAY TO ALL ETERNITY
THEY SLEPT WIDE AWAKE THUS SWEETLY LULLED
OH SPLENDID LETHARGY OF THE
REAL OVERWHELMED BY THE IDEAL
SOMETIMES BEAUTIFUL AS COSETTE WAS MARIUS SHUT HIS EYES IN HER
PRESENCE
THE BEST WAY TO LOOK AT THE SOUL IS THROUGH CLOSED EYES
MARIUS AND COSETTE NEVER ASKED THEMSELVES WHITHER THIS WAS TO LEAD THEM
THEY CONSIDERED THAT THEY HAD ALREADY ARRIVED
IT IS A STRANGE CLAIM ON
MAN'S PART TO WISH THAT LOVE SHOULD LEAD TO SOMETHING
CHAPTER III THE BEGINNING OF SHADOW
JEAN VALJEAN SUSPECTED NOTHING
COSETTE WHO WAS RATHER LESS DREAMY THAN MARIUS WAS GAY AND THAT
SUFFICED FOR JEAN VALJEAN'S HAPPINESS
THE THOUGHTS WHICH COSETTE
CHERISHED HER TENDER PREOCCUPATIONS MARIUS' IMAGE WHICH FILLED HER
HEART TOOK AWAY NOTHING FROM THE INCOMPARABLE PURITY OF HER BEAUTIFUL
CHASTE AND SMILING BROW
SHE WAS AT THE AGE WHEN THE VIRGIN BEARS HER
LOVE AS THE ANGEL HIS LILY
SO JEAN VALJEAN WAS AT EASE
AND THEN WHEN
TWO LOVERS HAVE COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING THINGS ALWAYS GO WELL THE
THIRD PARTY WHO MIGHT DISTURB THEIR LOVE IS KEPT IN A STATE OF PERFECT
BLINDNESS BY A RESTRICTED NUMBER OF PRECAUTIONS WHICH ARE ALWAYS THE
SAME IN THE CASE OF ALL LOVERS
THUS COSETTE NEVER OBJECTED TO ANY OF
JEAN VALJEAN'S PROPOSALS
DID SHE WANT TO TAKE A WALK YES DEAR LITTLE
FATHER DID SHE WANT TO STAY AT HOME VERY GOOD
DID HE WISH TO PASS
THE EVENING WITH COSETTE SHE WAS DELIGHTED
AS HE ALWAYS WENT TO BED AT
TEN O'CLOCK MARIUS DID NOT COME TO THE GARDEN ON SUCH OCCASIONS UNTIL
AFTER THAT HOUR WHEN FROM THE STREET HE HEARD COSETTE OPEN THE LONG
GLASS DOOR ON THE VERANDA
OF COURSE NO ONE EVER MET MARIUS IN THE
DAYTIME
JEAN VALJEAN NEVER EVEN DREAMED ANY LONGER THAT MARIUS WAS IN
EXISTENCE
ONLY ONCE ONE MORNING HE CHANCED TO SAY TO COSETTE WHY
YOU HAVE WHITEWASH ON YOUR BACK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING MARIUS IN A
TRANSPORT HAD PUSHED COSETTE AGAINST THE WALL
OLD TOUSSAINT WHO RETIRED EARLY THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT HER SLEEP AND
WAS AS IGNORANT OF THE WHOLE MATTER AS JEAN VALJEAN
MARIUS NEVER SET FOOT IN THE HOUSE
WHEN HE WAS WITH COSETTE THEY HID
THEMSELVES IN A RECESS NEAR THE STEPS IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT NEITHER
BE SEEN NOR HEARD FROM THE STREET AND THERE THEY SAT FREQUENTLY
CONTENTING THEMSELVES BY WAY OF CONVERSATION WITH PRESSING EACH
OTHER'S HANDS TWENTY TIMES A MINUTE AS THEY GAZED AT THE BRANCHES OF THE
TREES
AT SUCH TIMES A THUNDERBOLT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN THIRTY PACES FROM
THEM AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED IT SO DEEPLY WAS THE REVERY OF
THE ONE ABSORBED AND SUNK IN THE REVERY OF THE OTHER
LIMPID PURITY
HOURS WHOLLY WHITE ALMOST ALL ALIKE
THIS SORT OF LOVE
IS A RECOLLECTION OF LILY PETALS AND THE PLUMAGE OF THE DOVE
THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE GARDEN LAY BETWEEN THEM AND THE STREET
EVERY
TIME THAT MARIUS ENTERED AND LEFT HE CAREFULLY ADJUSTED THE BAR OF THE
GATE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT NO DISPLACEMENT WAS VISIBLE
HE USUALLY WENT AWAY ABOUT MIDNIGHT AND RETURNED TO COURFEYRAC'S
LODGINGS
COURFEYRAC SAID TO BAHOREL
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT MARIUS COMES HOME NOWADAYS AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE
MORNING
BAHOREL REPLIED
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THERE'S ALWAYS A PETARD IN A SEMINARY FELLOW
AT TIMES COURFEYRAC FOLDED HIS ARMS ASSUMED A SERIOUS AIR AND SAID TO
MARIUS
YOU ARE GETTING IRREGULAR IN YOUR HABITS YOUNG MAN
COURFEYRAC BEING A PRACTICAL MAN DID NOT TAKE IN GOOD PART THIS
REFLECTION OF AN INVISIBLE PARADISE UPON MARIUS HE WAS NOT MUCH IN THE
HABIT OF CONCEALED PASSIONS IT MADE HIM IMPATIENT AND NOW AND THEN HE
CALLED UPON MARIUS TO COME BACK TO REALITY
ONE MORNING HE THREW HIM THIS ADMONITION
MY DEAR FELLOW YOU PRODUCE UPON ME THE EFFECT OF BEING LOCATED IN
THE MOON THE REALM OF DREAMS THE PROVINCE OF ILLUSIONS CAPITAL
SOAP BUBBLE
COME BE A GOOD BOY WHAT'S HER NAME
BUT NOTHING COULD INDUCE MARIUS TO TALK THEY MIGHT HAVE TORN OUT HIS
NAILS BEFORE ONE OF THE TWO SACRED SYLLABLES OF WHICH THAT INEFFABLE
NAME COSETTE WAS COMPOSED
TRUE LOVE IS AS LUMINOUS AS THE DAWN AND AS
SILENT AS THE TOMB
ONLY COURFEYRAC SAW THIS CHANGE IN MARIUS THAT HIS
TACITURNITY WAS OF THE BEAMING ORDER
DURING THIS SWEET MONTH OF MAY MARIUS AND COSETTE LEARNED TO KNOW THESE
IMMENSE DELIGHTS
TO DISPUTE AND TO SAY YOU FOR THOU SIMPLY THAT THEY
MIGHT SAY THOU THE BETTER AFTERWARDS
TO TALK AT GREAT LENGTH WITH VERY
MINUTE DETAILS OF PERSONS IN WHOM THEY TOOK NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST
IN THE WORLD ANOTHER PROOF THAT IN THAT RAVISHING OPERA CALLED LOVE
THE LIBRETTO COUNTS FOR ALMOST NOTHING
FOR MARIUS TO LISTEN TO COSETTE DISCUSSING FINERY
FOR COSETTE TO LISTEN TO MARIUS TALK IN POLITICS
TO LISTEN KNEE PRESSED TO KNEE TO THE CARRIAGES ROLLING ALONG THE RUE
DE BABYLONE
TO GAZE UPON THE SAME PLANET IN SPACE OR AT THE SAME GLOWWORM GLEAMING
IN THE GRASS
TO HOLD THEIR PEACE TOGETHER A STILL GREATER DELIGHT THAN CONVERSATION
ETC ETC
IN THE MEANTIME DIVERS COMPLICATIONS WERE APPROACHING
ONE EVENING MARIUS WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE RENDEZVOUS BY WAY OF THE
BOULEVARD DES INVALIDES
HE HABITUALLY WALKED WITH DROOPING HEAD
AS HE
WAS ON THE POINT OF TURNING THE CORNER OF THE RUE PLUMET HE HEARD SOME
ONE QUITE CLOSE TO HIM SAY
GOOD EVENING MONSIEUR MARIUS
HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND RECOGNIZED EPONINE
THIS PRODUCED A SINGULAR EFFECT UPON HIM
HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT
GIRL A SINGLE TIME SINCE THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD CONDUCTED HIM TO THE RUE
PLUMET HE HAD NOT SEEN HER AGAIN AND SHE HAD GONE COMPLETELY OUT OF
HIS MIND
HE HAD NO REASONS FOR ANYTHING BUT GRATITUDE TOWARDS HER HE
OWED HER HIS HAPPINESS AND YET IT WAS EMBARRASSING TO HIM TO MEET HER
IT IS AN ERROR TO THINK THAT PASSION WHEN IT IS PURE AND HAPPY LEADS
MAN TO A STATE OF PERFECTION IT SIMPLY LEADS HIM AS WE HAVE NOTED TO
A STATE OF OBLIVION
IN THIS SITUATION MAN FORGETS TO BE BAD BUT
HE ALSO FORGETS TO BE GOOD
GRATITUDE DUTY MATTERS ESSENTIAL AND
IMPORTANT TO BE REMEMBERED VANISH
AT ANY OTHER TIME MARIUS WOULD HAVE
BEHAVED QUITE DIFFERENTLY TO EPONINE
ABSORBED IN COSETTE HE HAD NOT
EVEN CLEARLY PUT IT TO HIMSELF THAT THIS EPONINE WAS NAMED EPONINE
THENARDIER AND THAT SHE BORE THE NAME INSCRIBED IN HIS FATHER'S WILL
THAT NAME FOR WHICH BUT A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE WOULD HAVE SO ARDENTLY
SACRIFICED HIMSELF
WE SHOW MARIUS AS HE WAS
HIS FATHER HIMSELF WAS
FADING OUT OF HIS SOUL TO SOME EXTENT UNDER THE SPLENDOR OF HIS LOVE
HE REPLIED WITH SOME EMBARRASSMENT
AH SO IT'S YOU EPONINE
WHY DO YOU CALL ME YOU HAVE I DONE ANYTHING TO YOU
NO HE ANSWERED
CERTAINLY HE HAD NOTHING AGAINST HER
FAR FROM IT
ONLY HE FELT THAT
HE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE NOW THAT HE USED THOU TO COSETTE THAN SAY
YOU TO EPONINE
AS HE REMAINED SILENT SHE EXCLAIMED
SAY
THEN SHE PAUSED
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH WORDS FAILED THAT CREATURE FORMERLY
SO HEEDLESS AND SO BOLD
SHE TRIED TO SMILE AND COULD NOT
THEN SHE
RESUMED
WELL
THEN SHE PAUSED AGAIN AND REMAINED WITH DOWNCAST EYES
GOOD EVENING MR
MARIUS SAID SHE SUDDENLY AND ABRUPTLY AND AWAY SHE
WENT
CHAPTER IV A CAB RUNS IN ENGLISH AND BARKS IN SLANG
THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS THE 3D OF JUNE 1832 A DATE WHICH IT IS NECESSARY
TO INDICATE ON ACCOUNT OF THE GRAVE EVENTS WHICH AT THAT EPOCH HUNG ON
THE HORIZON OF PARIS IN THE STATE OF LIGHTNING CHARGED CLOUDS
MARIUS
AT NIGHTFALL WAS PURSUING THE SAME ROAD AS ON THE PRECEDING EVENING
WITH THE SAME THOUGHTS OF DELIGHT IN HIS HEART WHEN HE CAUGHT SIGHT
OF EPONINE APPROACHING THROUGH THE TREES OF THE BOULEVARD
TWO DAYS
IN SUCCESSION THIS WAS TOO MUCH
HE TURNED HASTILY ASIDE QUITTED THE
BOULEVARD CHANGED HIS COURSE AND WENT TO THE RUE PLUMET THROUGH THE RUE
MONSIEUR
THIS CAUSED EPONINE TO FOLLOW HIM TO THE RUE PLUMET A THING WHICH
SHE HAD NOT YET DONE
UP TO THAT TIME SHE HAD CONTENTED HERSELF WITH
WATCHING HIM ON HIS PASSAGE ALONG THE BOULEVARD WITHOUT EVER SEEKING TO
ENCOUNTER HIM
IT WAS ONLY ON THE EVENING BEFORE THAT SHE HAD ATTEMPTED
TO ADDRESS HIM
SO EPONINE FOLLOWED HIM WITHOUT HIS SUSPECTING THE FACT
SHE SAW HIM
DISPLACE THE BAR AND SLIP INTO THE GARDEN
SHE APPROACHED THE RAILING FELT OF THE BARS ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND
READILY RECOGNIZED THE ONE WHICH MARIUS HAD MOVED
SHE MURMURED IN A LOW VOICE AND IN GLOOMY ACCENTS
NONE OF THAT LISETTE
SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE UNDERPINNING OF THE RAILING CLOSE BESIDE THE
BAR AS THOUGH SHE WERE GUARDING IT
IT WAS PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE
THE RAILING TOUCHED THE NEIGHBORING WALL
THERE WAS A DIM NOOK THERE IN
WHICH EPONINE WAS ENTIRELY CONCEALED
SHE REMAINED THUS FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR WITHOUT STIRRING AND WITHOUT
BREATHING A PREY TO HER THOUGHTS
TOWARDS TEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING ONE OF THE TWO OR THREE PERSONS WHO
PASSED THROUGH THE RUE PLUMET AN OLD BELATED BOURGEOIS WHO WAS MAKING
HASTE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS DESERTED SPOT OF EVIL REPUTE AS HE SKIRTED
THE GARDEN RAILINGS AND REACHED THE ANGLE WHICH IT MADE WITH THE WALL
HEARD A DULL AND THREATENING VOICE SAYING
I'M NO LONGER SURPRISED THAT HE COMES HERE EVERY EVENING
THE PASSER BY CAST A GLANCE AROUND HIM SAW NO ONE DARED NOT PEER INTO
THE BLACK NICHE AND WAS GREATLY ALARMED
HE REDOUBLED HIS PACE
THIS PASSER BY HAD REASON TO MAKE HASTE FOR A VERY FEW INSTANTS LATER
SIX MEN WHO WERE MARCHING SEPARATELY AND AT SOME DISTANCE FROM EACH
OTHER ALONG THE WALL AND WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR A GRAY PATROL
ENTERED THE RUE PLUMET
THE FIRST TO ARRIVE AT THE GARDEN RAILING HALTED AND WAITED FOR THE
OTHERS A SECOND LATER ALL SIX WERE REUNITED
THESE MEN BEGAN TO TALK IN A LOW VOICE
THIS IS THE PLACE SAID ONE OF THEM
IS THERE A CAB DOG IN THE GARDEN ASKED ANOTHER
I DON'T KNOW
IN ANY CASE I HAVE FETCHED A BALL THAT WE'LL MAKE HIM
EAT
HAVE YOU SOME PUTTY TO BREAK THE PANE WITH
YES
THE RAILING IS OLD INTERPOLATED A FIFTH WHO HAD THE VOICE OF A
VENTRILOQUIST
SO MUCH THE BETTER SAID THE SECOND WHO HAD SPOKEN
IT WON'T SCREECH
UNDER THE SAW AND IT WON'T BE HARD TO CUT
THE SIXTH WHO HAD NOT YET OPENED HIS LIPS NOW BEGAN TO INSPECT
THE GATE AS EPONINE HAD DONE AN HOUR EARLIER GRASPING EACH BAR IN
SUCCESSION AND SHAKING THEM CAUTIOUSLY
THUS HE CAME TO THE BAR WHICH MARIUS HAD LOOSENED
AS HE WAS ON THE
POINT OF GRASPING THIS BAR A HAND EMERGED ABRUPTLY FROM THE DARKNESS
FELL UPON HIS ARM HE FELT HIMSELF VIGOROUSLY THRUST ASIDE BY A PUSH
IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BREAST AND A HOARSE VOICE SAID TO HIM BUT NOT
LOUDLY
THERE'S A DOG
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE PERCEIVED A PALE GIRL STANDING BEFORE HIM
THE MAN UNDERWENT THAT SHOCK WHICH THE UNEXPECTED ALWAYS BRINGS
HE
BRISTLED UP IN HIDEOUS WISE NOTHING IS SO FORMIDABLE TO BEHOLD AS
FEROCIOUS BEASTS WHO ARE UNEASY THEIR TERRIFIED AIR EVOKES TERROR
HE RECOILED AND STAMMERED
WHAT JADE IS THIS
YOUR DAUGHTER
IT WAS IN FACT EPONINE WHO HAD ADDRESSED THENARDIER
AT THE APPARITION OF EPONINE THE OTHER FIVE THAT IS TO SAY
CLAQUESOUS GUELEMER BABET BRUJON AND MONTPARNASSE HAD NOISELESSLY
DRAWN NEAR WITHOUT PRECIPITATION WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD WITH THE
SINISTER SLOWNESS PECULIAR TO THESE MEN OF THE NIGHT
SOME INDESCRIBABLE BUT HIDEOUS TOOLS WERE VISIBLE IN THEIR HANDS
GUELEMER HELD ONE OF THOSE PAIRS OF CURVED PINCERS WHICH PROWLERS CALL
FANCHONS
AH SEE HERE WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT THERE WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH US ARE
YOU CRAZY EXCLAIMED THENARDIER AS LOUDLY AS ONE CAN EXCLAIM AND STILL
SPEAK LOW WHAT HAVE YOU COME HERE TO HINDER OUR WORK FOR
EPONINE BURST OUT LAUGHING AND THREW HERSELF ON HIS NECK
I AM HERE LITTLE FATHER BECAUSE I AM HERE
ISN'T A PERSON ALLOWED TO
SIT ON THE STONES NOWADAYS IT'S YOU WHO OUGHT NOT TO BE HERE
WHAT
HAVE YOU COME HERE FOR SINCE IT'S A BISCUIT I TOLD MAGNON SO
THERE'S
NOTHING TO BE DONE HERE
BUT EMBRACE ME MY GOOD LITTLE FATHER IT'S A
LONG TIME SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU SO YOU'RE OUT
THENARDIER TRIED TO DISENTANGLE HIMSELF FROM EPONINE'S ARMS AND
GRUMBLED
THAT'S GOOD
YOU'VE EMBRACED ME
YES I'M OUT
I'M NOT IN
NOW GET
AWAY WITH YOU
BUT EPONINE DID NOT RELEASE HER HOLD AND REDOUBLED HER CARESSES
BUT HOW DID YOU MANAGE IT LITTLE PA YOU MUST HAVE BEEN VERY CLEVER TO
GET OUT OF THAT
TELL ME ABOUT IT AND MY MOTHER WHERE IS MOTHER TELL
ME ABOUT MAMMA
THENARDIER REPLIED
SHE'S WELL
I DON'T KNOW LET ME ALONE AND BE OFF I TELL YOU
I WON'T GO SO THERE NOW POUTED EPONINE LIKE A SPOILED CHILD YOU
SEND ME OFF AND IT'S FOUR MONTHS SINCE I SAW YOU AND I'VE HARDLY HAD
TIME TO KISS YOU
AND SHE CAUGHT HER FATHER ROUND THE NECK AGAIN
COME NOW THIS IS STUPID SAID BABET
MAKE HASTE SAID GUELEMER THE COPS MAY PASS
THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE REPEATED HIS DISTICH
NOUS N' SOMMES PAS LE JOUR DE L'AN
THIS ISN'T NEW YEAR'S DAY
A BECOTER PAPA MAMAN
TO PECK AT PA AND MA
EPONINE TURNED TO THE FIVE RUFFIANS
WHY IT'S MONSIEUR BRUJON
GOOD DAY MONSIEUR BABET
GOOD DAY
MONSIEUR CLAQUESOUS
DON'T YOU KNOW ME MONSIEUR GUELEMER HOW GOES IT
MONTPARNASSE
YES THEY KNOW YOU EJACULATED THENARDIER
BUT GOOD DAY GOOD
EVENING SHEER OFF LEAVE US ALONE
IT'S THE HOUR FOR FOXES NOT FOR CHICKENS SAID MONTPARNASSE
YOU SEE THE JOB WE HAVE ON HAND HERE ADDED BABET
EPONINE CAUGHT MONTPARNASSE'S HAND
TAKE CARE SAID HE YOU'LL CUT YOURSELF I'VE A KNIFE OPEN
MY LITTLE MONTPARNASSE RESPONDED EPONINE VERY GENTLY YOU MUST HAVE
CONFIDENCE IN PEOPLE
I AM THE DAUGHTER OF MY FATHER PERHAPS
MONSIEUR
BABET MONSIEUR GUELEMER I'M THE PERSON WHO WAS CHARGED TO INVESTIGATE
THIS MATTER
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT EPONINE DID NOT TALK SLANG
THAT FRIGHTFUL TONGUE
HAD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO HER SINCE SHE HAD KNOWN MARIUS
SHE PRESSED IN HER HAND SMALL BONY AND FEEBLE AS THAT OF A SKELETON
GUELEMER'S HUGE COARSE FINGERS AND CONTINUED
YOU KNOW WELL THAT I'M NO FOOL
ORDINARILY I AM BELIEVED
I HAVE
RENDERED YOU SERVICE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS
WELL I HAVE MADE INQUIRIES
YOU WILL EXPOSE YOURSELVES TO NO PURPOSE YOU SEE
I SWEAR TO YOU THAT
THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS HOUSE
THERE ARE LONE WOMEN SAID GUELEMER
NO THE PERSONS HAVE MOVED AWAY
THE CANDLES HAVEN'T ANYWAY EJACULATED BABET
AND HE POINTED OUT TO EPONINE ACROSS THE TOPS OF THE TREES A LIGHT
WHICH WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN THE MANSARD ROOF OF THE PAVILION
IT WAS
TOUSSAINT WHO HAD STAYED UP TO SPREAD OUT SOME LINEN TO DRY
EPONINE MADE A FINAL EFFORT
WELL SAID SHE THEY'RE VERY POOR FOLKS AND IT'S A HOVEL WHERE THERE
ISN'T A SOU
GO TO THE DEVIL CRIED THENARDIER
WHEN WE'VE TURNED THE HOUSE UPSIDE
DOWN AND PUT THE CELLAR AT THE TOP AND THE ATTIC BELOW WE'LL TELL
YOU WHAT THERE IS INSIDE AND WHETHER IT'S FRANCS OR SOUS OR
HALF FARTHINGS
AND HE PUSHED HER ASIDE WITH THE INTENTION OF ENTERING
MY GOOD FRIEND MR
MONTPARNASSE SAID EPONINE I ENTREAT YOU YOU
ARE A GOOD FELLOW DON'T ENTER
TAKE CARE YOU'LL CUT YOURSELF REPLIED MONTPARNASSE
THENARDIER RESUMED IN HIS DECIDED TONE
DECAMP MY GIRL AND LEAVE MEN TO THEIR OWN AFFAIRS
EPONINE RELEASED MONTPARNASSE'S HAND WHICH SHE HAD GRASPED AGAIN AND
SAID
SO YOU MEAN TO ENTER THIS HOUSE
RATHER GRINNED THE VENTRILOQUIST
THEN SHE SET HER BACK AGAINST THE GATE FACED THE SIX RUFFIANS WHO WERE
ARMED TO THE TEETH AND TO WHOM THE NIGHT LENT THE VISAGES OF DEMONS
AND SAID IN A FIRM LOW VOICE
WELL I DON'T MEAN THAT YOU SHALL
THEY HALTED IN AMAZEMENT
THE VENTRILOQUIST HOWEVER FINISHED HIS GRIN
SHE WENT ON
FRIENDS LISTEN WELL
THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT
NOW I'M TALKING
IN
THE FIRST PLACE IF YOU ENTER THIS GARDEN IF YOU LAY A HAND ON THIS
GATE I'LL SCREAM I'LL BEAT ON THE DOOR I'LL ROUSE EVERYBODY I'LL
HAVE THE WHOLE SIX OF YOU SEIZED I'LL CALL THE POLICE
SHE'D DO IT TOO SAID THENARDIER IN A LOW TONE TO BRUJON AND THE
VENTRILOQUIST
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND ADDED
BEGINNING WITH MY FATHER
THENARDIER STEPPED NEARER
NOT SO CLOSE MY GOOD MAN SAID SHE
HE RETREATED GROWLING BETWEEN HIS TEETH
WHY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER
AND HE ADDED
BITCH
SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH IN A TERRIBLE WAY
AS YOU LIKE BUT YOU SHALL NOT ENTER HERE
I'M NOT THE DAUGHTER OF
A DOG SINCE I'M THE DAUGHTER OF A WOLF
THERE ARE SIX OF YOU WHAT
MATTERS THAT TO ME YOU ARE MEN
WELL I'M A WOMAN
YOU DON'T FRIGHTEN
ME
I TELL YOU THAT YOU SHAN'T ENTER THIS HOUSE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SUIT
ME
IF YOU APPROACH I'LL BARK
I TOLD YOU I'M THE DOG AND I DON'T
CARE A STRAW FOR YOU
GO YOUR WAY YOU BORE ME GO WHERE YOU PLEASE BUT
DON'T COME HERE I FORBID IT YOU CAN USE YOUR KNIVES
I'LL USE KICKS
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME COME ON
SHE ADVANCED A PACE NEARER THE RUFFIANS SHE WAS TERRIBLE SHE BURST OUT
LAUGHING
PARDINE I'M NOT AFRAID
I SHALL BE HUNGRY THIS SUMMER AND I SHALL BE
COLD THIS WINTER
AREN'T THEY RIDICULOUS THESE NINNIES OF MEN TO THINK
THEY CAN SCARE A GIRL WHAT SCARE OH YES MUCH BECAUSE YOU HAVE
FINICAL POPPETS OF MISTRESSES WHO HIDE UNDER THE BED WHEN YOU PUT ON A
BIG VOICE FORSOOTH I AIN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING THAT I AIN'T
SHE FASTENED HER INTENT GAZE UPON THENARDIER AND SAID
NOT EVEN OF YOU FATHER
THEN SHE CONTINUED AS SHE CAST HER BLOOD SHOT SPECTRE LIKE EYES UPON
THE RUFFIANS IN TURN
WHAT DO I CARE IF I'M PICKED UP TO MORROW MORNING ON THE PAVEMENT OF
THE RUE PLUMET KILLED BY THE BLOWS OF MY FATHER'S CLUB OR WHETHER I'M
FOUND A YEAR FROM NOW IN THE NETS AT SAINT CLOUD OR THE ISLE OF SWANS IN
THE MIDST OF ROTTEN OLD CORKS AND DROWNED DOGS
SHE WAS FORCED TO PAUSE SHE WAS SEIZED BY A DRY COUGH HER BREATH CAME
FROM HER WEAK AND NARROW CHEST LIKE THE DEATH RATTLE
SHE RESUMED
I HAVE ONLY TO CRY OUT AND PEOPLE WILL COME AND THEN SLAP BANG
THERE ARE SIX OF YOU I REPRESENT THE WHOLE WORLD
THENARDIER MADE A MOVEMENT TOWARDS HER
DON'T APPROACH SHE CRIED
HE HALTED AND SAID GENTLY
WELL NO I WON'T APPROACH BUT DON'T SPEAK SO LOUD
SO YOU INTEND TO
HINDER US IN OUR WORK MY DAUGHTER BUT WE MUST EARN OUR LIVING ALL THE
SAME
HAVE YOU NO LONGER ANY KIND FEELING FOR YOUR FATHER
YOU BOTHER ME SAID EPONINE
BUT WE MUST LIVE WE MUST EAT
BURST
SO SAYING SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE UNDERPINNING OF THE FENCE AND
HUMMED
MON BRAS SI DODU MY ARM SO PLUMP
MA JAMBE BIEN FAITE MY LEG WELL FORMED
ET LE TEMPS PERDU AND TIME WASTED
SHE HAD SET HER ELBOW ON HER KNEE AND HER CHIN IN HER HAND AND SHE
SWUNG HER FOOT WITH AN AIR OF INDIFFERENCE
HER TATTERED GOWN PERMITTED
A VIEW OF HER THIN SHOULDER BLADES
THE NEIGHBORING STREET LANTERN
ILLUMINATED HER PROFILE AND HER ATTITUDE
NOTHING MORE RESOLUTE AND MORE
SURPRISING COULD BE SEEN
THE SIX RASCALS SPEECHLESS AND GLOOMY AT BEING HELD IN CHECK BY A GIRL
RETREATED BENEATH THE SHADOW CAST BY THE LANTERN AND HELD COUNSEL WITH
FURIOUS AND HUMILIATED SHRUGS
IN THE MEANTIME SHE STARED AT THEM WITH A STERN BUT PEACEFUL AIR
THERE'S SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH HER SAID BABET
A REASON
IS SHE
IN LOVE WITH THE DOG IT'S A SHAME TO MISS THIS ANYWAY
TWO WOMEN AN
OLD FELLOW WHO LODGES IN THE BACK YARD AND CURTAINS THAT AIN'T SO BAD
AT THE WINDOWS
THE OLD COVE MUST BE A JEW
I THINK THE JOB'S A GOOD
ONE
WELL GO IN THEN THE REST OF YOU EXCLAIMED MONTPARNASSE
DO THE
JOB
I'LL STAY HERE WITH THE GIRL AND IF SHE FAILS US
HE FLASHED THE KNIFE WHICH HE HELD OPEN IN HIS HAND IN THE LIGHT OF
THE LANTERN
THENARDIER SAID NOT A WORD AND SEEMED READY FOR WHATEVER THE REST
PLEASED
BRUJON WHO WAS SOMEWHAT OF AN ORACLE AND WHO HAD AS THE READER KNOWS
PUT UP THE JOB HAD NOT AS YET SPOKEN
HE SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
HE HAD
THE REPUTATION OF NOT STICKING AT ANYTHING AND IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE
HAD PLUNDERED A POLICE POST SIMPLY OUT OF BRAVADO
BESIDES THIS HE MADE
VERSES AND SONGS WHICH GAVE HIM GREAT AUTHORITY
BABET INTERROGATED HIM
YOU SAY NOTHING BRUJON
BRUJON REMAINED SILENT AN INSTANT LONGER THEN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD IN
VARIOUS WAYS AND FINALLY CONCLUDED TO SPEAK
SEE HERE THIS MORNING I CAME ACROSS TWO SPARROWS FIGHTING THIS
EVENING I JOSTLED A WOMAN WHO WAS QUARRELLING
ALL THAT'S BAD
LET'S
QUIT
THEY WENT AWAY
AS THEY WENT MONTPARNASSE MUTTERED
NEVER MIND IF THEY HAD WANTED I'D HAVE CUT HER THROAT
BABET RESPONDED
I WOULDN'T
I DON'T HIT A LADY
AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET THEY HALTED AND EXCHANGED THE FOLLOWING
ENIGMATICAL DIALOGUE IN A LOW TONE
WHERE SHALL WE GO TO SLEEP TO NIGHT
UNDER PANTIN PARIS
HAVE YOU THE KEY TO THE GATE THENARDIER
PARDI
EPONINE WHO NEVER TOOK HER EYES OFF OF THEM SAW THEM RETREAT BY THE
ROAD BY WHICH THEY HAD COME
SHE ROSE AND BEGAN TO CREEP AFTER THEM
ALONG THE WALLS AND THE HOUSES
SHE FOLLOWED THEM THUS AS FAR AS THE
BOULEVARD
THERE THEY PARTED AND SHE SAW THESE SIX MEN PLUNGE INTO THE GLOOM
WHERE THEY APPEARED TO MELT AWAY
CHAPTER V THINGS OF THE NIGHT
AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE RUFFIANS THE RUE PLUMET RESUMED ITS
TRANQUIL NOCTURNAL ASPECT
THAT WHICH HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE IN THIS
STREET WOULD NOT HAVE ASTONISHED A FOREST
THE LOFTY TREES THE COPSES
THE HEATHS THE BRANCHES RUDELY INTERLACED THE TALL GRASS EXIST IN
A SOMBRE MANNER THE SAVAGE SWARMING THERE CATCHES GLIMPSES OF SUDDEN
APPARITIONS OF THE INVISIBLE THAT WHICH IS BELOW MAN DISTINGUISHES
THROUGH THE MISTS THAT WHICH IS BEYOND MAN AND THE THINGS OF WHICH WE
LIVING BEINGS ARE IGNORANT THERE MEET FACE TO FACE IN THE NIGHT
NATURE
BRISTLING AND WILD TAKES ALARM AT CERTAIN APPROACHES IN WHICH SHE
FANCIES THAT SHE FEELS THE SUPERNATURAL
THE FORCES OF THE GLOOM KNOW
EACH OTHER AND ARE STRANGELY BALANCED BY EACH OTHER
TEETH AND CLAWS
FEAR WHAT THEY CANNOT GRASP
BLOOD DRINKING BESTIALITY VORACIOUS
APPETITES HUNGER IN SEARCH OF PREY THE ARMED INSTINCTS OF NAILS
AND JAWS WHICH HAVE FOR SOURCE AND AIM THE BELLY GLARE AND SMELL OUT
UNEASILY THE IMPASSIVE SPECTRAL FORMS STRAYING BENEATH A SHROUD ERECT
IN ITS VAGUE AND SHUDDERING ROBE AND WHICH SEEM TO THEM TO LIVE WITH
A DEAD AND TERRIBLE LIFE
THESE BRUTALITIES WHICH ARE ONLY MATTER
ENTERTAIN A CONFUSED FEAR OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE IMMENSE OBSCURITY
CONDENSED INTO AN UNKNOWN BEING
A BLACK FIGURE BARRING THE WAY STOPS
THE WILD BEAST SHORT
THAT WHICH EMERGES FROM THE CEMETERY INTIMIDATES
AND DISCONCERTS THAT WHICH EMERGES FROM THE CAVE THE FEROCIOUS FEAR THE
SINISTER WOLVES RECOIL WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER A GHOUL
CHAPTER VI MARIUS BECOMES PRACTICAL ONCE MORE TO THE EXTENT OF GIVING
COSETTE HIS ADDRESS
WHILE THIS SORT OF A DOG WITH A HUMAN FACE WAS MOUNTING GUARD OVER THE
GATE AND WHILE THE SIX RUFFIANS WERE YIELDING TO A GIRL MARIUS WAS BY
COSETTE'S SIDE
NEVER HAD THE SKY BEEN MORE STUDDED WITH STARS AND MORE CHARMING THE
TREES MORE TREMBLING THE ODOR OF THE GRASS MORE PENETRATING NEVER HAD
THE BIRDS FALLEN ASLEEP AMONG THE LEAVES WITH A SWEETER NOISE NEVER HAD
ALL THE HARMONIES OF UNIVERSAL SERENITY RESPONDED MORE THOROUGHLY TO THE
INWARD MUSIC OF LOVE NEVER HAD MARIUS BEEN MORE CAPTIVATED MORE HAPPY
MORE ECSTATIC
BUT HE HAD FOUND COSETTE SAD COSETTE HAD BEEN WEEPING
HER EYES WERE
RED
THIS WAS THE FIRST CLOUD IN THAT WONDERFUL DREAM
MARIUS' FIRST WORD HAD BEEN WHAT IS THE MATTER
AND SHE HAD REPLIED THIS
THEN SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE BENCH NEAR THE STEPS AND WHILE HE
TREMBLINGLY TOOK HIS PLACE BESIDE HER SHE HAD CONTINUED
MY FATHER TOLD ME THIS MORNING TO HOLD MYSELF IN READINESS BECAUSE HE
HAS BUSINESS AND WE MAY GO AWAY FROM HERE
MARIUS SHIVERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT
WHEN ONE IS AT THE END OF ONE'S LIFE TO DIE MEANS TO GO AWAY WHEN ONE
IS AT THE BEGINNING OF IT TO GO AWAY MEANS TO DIE
FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS MARIUS HAD LITTLE BY LITTLE SLOWLY BY DEGREES
TAKEN POSSESSION OF COSETTE EACH DAY
AS WE HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED IN
THE CASE OF FIRST LOVE THE SOUL IS TAKEN LONG BEFORE THE BODY LATER
ON ONE TAKES THE BODY LONG BEFORE THE SOUL SOMETIMES ONE DOES NOT TAKE
THE SOUL AT ALL THE FAUBLAS AND THE PRUDHOMMES ADD BECAUSE THERE IS
NONE BUT THE SARCASM IS FORTUNATELY A BLASPHEMY
SO MARIUS POSSESSED
COSETTE AS SPIRITS POSSESS BUT HE ENVELOPED HER WITH ALL HIS SOUL AND
SEIZED HER JEALOUSLY WITH INCREDIBLE CONVICTION
HE POSSESSED HER SMILE
HER BREATH HER PERFUME THE PROFOUND RADIANCE OF HER BLUE EYES THE
SWEETNESS OF HER SKIN WHEN HE TOUCHED HER HAND THE CHARMING MARK WHICH
SHE HAD ON HER NECK ALL HER THOUGHTS
THEREFORE HE POSSESSED ALL
COSETTE'S DREAMS
HE INCESSANTLY GAZED AT AND HE SOMETIMES TOUCHED LIGHTLY WITH HIS
BREATH THE SHORT LOCKS ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK AND HE DECLARED TO
HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE SHORT HAIRS WHICH DID NOT BELONG
TO HIM MARIUS
HE GAZED UPON AND ADORED THE THINGS THAT SHE WORE HER
KNOT OF RIBBON HER GLOVES HER SLEEVES HER SHOES HER CUFFS AS SACRED
OBJECTS OF WHICH HE WAS THE MASTER
HE DREAMED THAT HE WAS THE LORD OF
THOSE PRETTY SHELL COMBS WHICH SHE WORE IN HER HAIR AND HE EVEN SAID TO
HIMSELF IN CONFUSED AND SUPPRESSED STAMMERINGS OF VOLUPTUOUSNESS WHICH
DID NOT MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE LIGHT THAT THERE WAS NOT A RIBBON OF HER
GOWN NOT A MESH IN HER STOCKINGS NOT A FOLD IN HER BODICE WHICH WAS
NOT HIS
BESIDE COSETTE HE FELT HIMSELF BESIDE HIS OWN PROPERTY HIS
OWN THING HIS OWN DESPOT AND HIS SLAVE
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY HAD
SO INTERMINGLED THEIR SOULS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
THEM APART HAD THEY WISHED TO TAKE THEM BACK AGAIN THIS IS MINE
NO IT IS MINE I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU ARE MISTAKEN
THIS IS MY
PROPERTY WHAT YOU ARE TAKING AS YOUR OWN IS MYSELF MARIUS WAS
SOMETHING THAT MADE A PART OF COSETTE AND COSETTE WAS SOMETHING WHICH
MADE A PART OF MARIUS
MARIUS FELT COSETTE WITHIN HIM
TO HAVE COSETTE
TO POSSESS COSETTE THIS TO HIM WAS NOT TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM
BREATHING
IT WAS IN THE MIDST OF THIS FAITH OF THIS INTOXICATION OF
THIS VIRGIN POSSESSION UNPRECEDENTED AND ABSOLUTE OF THIS SOVEREIGNTY
THAT THESE WORDS WE ARE GOING AWAY FELL SUDDENLY AT A BLOW AND
THAT THE HARSH VOICE OF REALITY CRIED TO HIM COSETTE IS NOT YOURS
MARIUS AWOKE
FOR SIX WEEKS MARIUS HAD BEEN LIVING AS WE HAVE SAID
OUTSIDE OF LIFE THOSE WORDS GOING AWAY CAUSED HIM TO RE ENTER IT
HARSHLY
HE FOUND NOT A WORD TO SAY
COSETTE MERELY FELT THAT HIS HAND WAS VERY
COLD
SHE SAID TO HIM IN HER TURN WHAT IS THE MATTER
HE REPLIED IN SO LOW A TONE THAT COSETTE HARDLY HEARD HIM
I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID
SHE BEGAN AGAIN
THIS MORNING MY FATHER TOLD ME TO SETTLE ALL MY LITTLE AFFAIRS AND TO
HOLD MYSELF IN READINESS THAT HE WOULD GIVE ME HIS LINEN TO PUT IN A
TRUNK THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO ON A JOURNEY THAT WE WERE TO GO AWAY
THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE A LARGE TRUNK FOR ME AND A SMALL ONE FOR
HIM AND THAT ALL IS TO BE READY IN A WEEK FROM NOW AND THAT WE MIGHT
GO TO ENGLAND
BUT THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS EXCLAIMED MARIUS
IT IS CERTAIN THAT AT THAT MOMENT NO ABUSE OF POWER NO VIOLENCE NOT
ONE OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE WORST TYRANTS NO ACTION OF BUSIRIS OF
TIBERIUS OR OF HENRY VIII COULD HAVE EQUALLED THIS IN ATROCITY
IN THE OPINION OF MARIUS M
FAUCHELEVENT TAKING HIS DAUGHTER OFF TO
ENGLAND BECAUSE HE HAD BUSINESS THERE
HE DEMANDED IN A WEAK VOICE
AND WHEN DO YOU START
HE DID NOT SAY WHEN
AND WHEN SHALL YOU RETURN
HE DID NOT SAY WHEN
MARIUS ROSE AND SAID COLDLY
COSETTE SHALL YOU GO
COSETTE TURNED TOWARD HIM HER BEAUTIFUL EYES ALL FILLED WITH ANGUISH
AND REPLIED IN A SORT OF BEWILDERMENT
WHERE
TO ENGLAND
SHALL YOU GO
WHY DO YOU SAY YOU TO ME
I ASK YOU WHETHER YOU WILL GO
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO SHE SAID CLASPING HER HANDS
SO YOU WILL GO
IF MY FATHER GOES
SO YOU WILL GO
COSETTE TOOK MARIUS' HAND AND PRESSED IT WITHOUT REPLYING
VERY WELL SAID MARIUS THEN I WILL GO ELSEWHERE
COSETTE FELT RATHER THAN UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THESE WORDS
SHE TURNED SO PALE THAT HER FACE SHONE WHITE THROUGH THE GLOOM
SHE
STAMMERED
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
MARIUS LOOKED AT HER THEN RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN AND ANSWERED
NOTHING
WHEN HIS EYES FELL AGAIN HE SAW COSETTE SMILING AT HIM
THE SMILE OF A
WOMAN WHOM ONE LOVES POSSESSES A VISIBLE RADIANCE EVEN AT NIGHT
HOW SILLY WE ARE MARIUS I HAVE AN IDEA
WHAT IS IT
IF WE GO AWAY DO YOU GO TOO I WILL TELL YOU WHERE COME AND JOIN ME
WHEREVER I AM
MARIUS WAS NOW A THOROUGHLY ROUSED MAN
HE HAD FALLEN BACK INTO REALITY
HE CRIED TO COSETTE
GO AWAY WITH YOU ARE YOU MAD WHY I SHOULD HAVE TO HAVE MONEY AND I
HAVE NONE GO TO ENGLAND BUT I AM IN DEBT NOW I OWE I DON'T KNOW HOW
MUCH MORE THAN TEN LOUIS TO COURFEYRAC ONE OF MY FRIENDS WITH WHOM YOU
ARE NOT ACQUAINTED I HAVE AN OLD HAT WHICH IS NOT WORTH THREE FRANCS
I HAVE A COAT WHICH LACKS BUTTONS IN FRONT MY SHIRT IS ALL RAGGED MY
ELBOWS ARE TORN MY BOOTS LET IN THE WATER FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS I
HAVE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU ABOUT IT
YOU ONLY
SEE ME AT NIGHT AND YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE IF YOU WERE TO SEE ME IN THE
DAYTIME YOU WOULD GIVE ME A SOU GO TO ENGLAND EH I HAVEN'T ENOUGH TO
PAY FOR A PASSPORT
HE THREW HIMSELF AGAINST A TREE WHICH WAS CLOSE AT HAND ERECT HIS BROW
PRESSED CLOSE TO THE BARK FEELING NEITHER THE WOOD WHICH FLAYED HIS
SKIN NOR THE FEVER WHICH WAS THROBBING IN HIS TEMPLES AND THERE HE
STOOD MOTIONLESS ON THE POINT OF FALLING LIKE THE STATUE OF DESPAIR
HE REMAINED A LONG TIME THUS
ONE COULD REMAIN FOR ETERNITY IN SUCH
ABYSSES
AT LAST HE TURNED ROUND
HE HEARD BEHIND HIM A FAINT STIFLED
NOISE WHICH WAS SWEET YET SAD
IT WAS COSETTE SOBBING
SHE HAD BEEN WEEPING FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS BESIDE MARIUS AS HE
MEDITATED
HE CAME TO HER FELL AT HER KNEES AND SLOWLY PROSTRATING HIMSELF HE
TOOK THE TIP OF HER FOOT WHICH PEEPED OUT FROM BENEATH HER ROBE AND
KISSED IT
SHE LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY IN SILENCE
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN A WOMAN
ACCEPTS LIKE A SOMBRE AND RESIGNED GODDESS THE RELIGION OF LOVE
DO NOT WEEP HE SAID
SHE MURMURED
NOT WHEN I MAY BE GOING AWAY AND YOU CANNOT COME
HE WENT ON
DO YOU LOVE ME
SHE REPLIED SOBBING BY THAT WORD FROM PARADISE WHICH IS NEVER MORE
CHARMING THAN AMID TEARS
I ADORE YOU
HE CONTINUED IN A TONE WHICH WAS AN INDESCRIBABLE CARESS
DO NOT WEEP
TELL ME WILL YOU DO THIS FOR ME AND CEASE TO WEEP
DO YOU LOVE ME SAID SHE
HE TOOK HER HAND
COSETTE I HAVE NEVER GIVEN MY WORD OF HONOR TO ANY ONE BECAUSE MY
WORD OF HONOR TERRIFIES ME
I FEEL THAT MY FATHER IS BY MY SIDE
WELL I
GIVE YOU MY MOST SACRED WORD OF HONOR THAT IF YOU GO AWAY I SHALL DIE
IN THE TONE WITH WHICH HE UTTERED THESE WORDS THERE LAY A MELANCHOLY SO
SOLEMN AND SO TRANQUIL THAT COSETTE TREMBLED
SHE FELT THAT CHILL WHICH
IS PRODUCED BY A TRUE AND GLOOMY THING AS IT PASSES BY
THE SHOCK MADE
HER CEASE WEEPING
NOW LISTEN SAID HE DO NOT EXPECT ME TO MORROW
WHY
DO NOT EXPECT ME UNTIL THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW
OH WHY
YOU WILL SEE
A DAY WITHOUT SEEING YOU BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
LET US SACRIFICE ONE DAY IN ORDER TO GAIN OUR WHOLE LIVES PERHAPS
AND MARIUS ADDED IN A LOW TONE AND IN AN ASIDE
HE IS A MAN WHO NEVER CHANGES HIS HABITS AND HE HAS NEVER RECEIVED ANY
ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENING
OF WHAT MAN ARE YOU SPEAKING ASKED COSETTE
I I SAID NOTHING
WHAT DO YOU HOPE THEN
WAIT UNTIL THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW
YOU WISH IT
YES COSETTE
SHE TOOK HIS HEAD IN BOTH HER HANDS RAISING HERSELF ON TIPTOE IN ORDER
TO BE ON A LEVEL WITH HIM AND TRIED TO READ HIS HOPE IN HIS EYES
MARIUS RESUMED
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW MY ADDRESS SOMETHING MIGHT
HAPPEN ONE NEVER KNOWS I LIVE WITH THAT FRIEND NAMED COURFEYRAC RUE
DE LA VERRERIE NO
16
HE SEARCHED IN HIS POCKET PULLED OUT HIS PENKNIFE AND WITH THE BLADE
HE WROTE ON THE PLASTER OF THE WALL
16 RUE DE LA VERRERIE
IN THE MEANTIME COSETTE HAD BEGUN TO GAZE INTO HIS EYES ONCE MORE
TELL ME YOUR THOUGHT MARIUS YOU HAVE SOME IDEA
TELL IT TO ME
OH
TELL ME SO THAT I MAY PASS A PLEASANT NIGHT
THIS IS MY IDEA THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT GOD SHOULD MEAN TO PART US
WAIT EXPECT ME THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW
WHAT SHALL I DO UNTIL THEN SAID COSETTE
YOU ARE OUTSIDE YOU GO
AND COME HOW HAPPY MEN ARE I SHALL REMAIN ENTIRELY ALONE OH HOW SAD
I SHALL BE WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO TO MORROW EVENING TELL
ME
I AM GOING TO TRY SOMETHING
THEN I WILL PRAY TO GOD AND I WILL THINK OF YOU HERE SO THAT YOU MAY
BE SUCCESSFUL
I WILL QUESTION YOU NO FURTHER SINCE YOU DO NOT WISH IT
YOU ARE MY MASTER
I SHALL PASS THE EVENING TO MORROW IN SINGING THAT
MUSIC FROM EURYANTHE THAT YOU LOVE AND THAT YOU CAME ONE EVENING TO
LISTEN TO OUTSIDE MY SHUTTERS
BUT DAY AFTER TO MORROW YOU WILL COME
EARLY
I SHALL EXPECT YOU AT DUSK AT NINE O'CLOCK PRECISELY I WARN
YOU
MON DIEU HOW SAD IT IS THAT THE DAYS ARE SO LONG ON THE STROKE OF
NINE DO YOU UNDERSTAND I SHALL BE IN THE GARDEN
AND I ALSO
AND WITHOUT HAVING UTTERED IT MOVED BY THE SAME THOUGHT IMPELLED BY
THOSE ELECTRIC CURRENTS WHICH PLACE LOVERS IN CONTINUAL COMMUNICATION
BOTH BEING INTOXICATED WITH DELIGHT EVEN IN THEIR SORROW THEY FELL INTO
EACH OTHER'S ARMS WITHOUT PERCEIVING THAT THEIR LIPS MET WHILE THEIR
UPLIFTED EYES OVERFLOWING WITH RAPTURE AND FULL OF TEARS GAZED UPON
THE STARS
WHEN MARIUS WENT FORTH THE STREET WAS DESERTED
THIS WAS THE MOMENT
WHEN EPONINE WAS FOLLOWING THE RUFFIANS TO THE BOULEVARD
WHILE MARIUS HAD BEEN DREAMING WITH HIS HEAD PRESSED TO THE TREE AN
IDEA HAD CROSSED HIS MIND AN IDEA ALAS THAT HE HIMSELF JUDGED TO BE
SENSELESS AND IMPOSSIBLE
HE HAD COME TO A DESPERATE DECISION
CHAPTER VII THE OLD HEART AND THE YOUNG HEART IN THE PRESENCE OF EACH
OTHER
AT THAT EPOCH FATHER GILLENORMAND WAS WELL PAST HIS NINETY FIRST
BIRTHDAY
HE STILL LIVED WITH MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND IN THE RUE DES
FILLES DU CALVAIRE NO
6 IN THE OLD HOUSE WHICH HE OWNED
HE WAS AS
THE READER WILL REMEMBER ONE OF THOSE ANTIQUE OLD MEN WHO AWAIT DEATH
PERFECTLY ERECT WHOM AGE BEARS DOWN WITHOUT BENDING AND WHOM EVEN
SORROW CANNOT CURVE
STILL HIS DAUGHTER HAD BEEN SAYING FOR SOME TIME MY FATHER IS
SINKING HE NO LONGER BOXED THE MAIDS' EARS HE NO LONGER THUMPED
THE LANDING PLACE SO VIGOROUSLY WITH HIS CANE WHEN BASQUE WAS SLOW IN
OPENING THE DOOR
THE REVOLUTION OF JULY HAD EXASPERATED HIM FOR THE
SPACE OF BARELY SIX MONTHS
HE HAD VIEWED ALMOST TRANQUILLY THAT
COUPLING OF WORDS IN THE MONITEUR M
HUMBLOT CONTE PEER OF FRANCE
THE FACT IS THAT THE OLD MAN WAS DEEPLY DEJECTED
HE DID NOT BEND HE
DID NOT YIELD THIS WAS NO MORE A CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS PHYSICAL THAN
OF HIS MORAL NATURE BUT HE FELT HIMSELF GIVING WAY INTERNALLY
FOR FOUR
YEARS HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR MARIUS WITH HIS FOOT FIRMLY PLANTED THAT
IS THE EXACT WORD IN THE CONVICTION THAT THAT GOOD FOR NOTHING YOUNG
SCAMP WOULD RING AT HIS DOOR SOME DAY OR OTHER NOW HE HAD REACHED
THE POINT WHERE AT CERTAIN GLOOMY HOURS HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT
IF MARIUS MADE HIM WAIT MUCH LONGER IT WAS NOT DEATH THAT WAS
INSUPPORTABLE TO HIM IT WAS THE IDEA THAT PERHAPS HE SHOULD NEVER SEE
MARIUS AGAIN
THE IDEA OF NEVER SEEING MARIUS AGAIN HAD NEVER ENTERED
HIS BRAIN UNTIL THAT DAY NOW THE THOUGHT BEGAN TO RECUR TO HIM AND
IT CHILLED HIM
ABSENCE AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE IN GENUINE AND NATURAL
SENTIMENTS HAD ONLY SERVED TO AUGMENT THE GRANDFATHER'S LOVE FOR THE
UNGRATEFUL CHILD WHO HAD GONE OFF LIKE A FLASH
IT IS DURING DECEMBER
NIGHTS WHEN THE COLD STANDS AT TEN DEGREES THAT ONE THINKS OFTENEST OF
THE SON
M
GILLENORMAND WAS OR THOUGHT HIMSELF ABOVE ALL THINGS INCAPABLE
OF TAKING A SINGLE STEP HE THE GRANDFATHER TOWARDS HIS GRANDSON I
WOULD DIE RATHER HE SAID TO HIMSELF
HE DID NOT CONSIDER HIMSELF
AS THE LEAST TO BLAME BUT HE THOUGHT OF MARIUS ONLY WITH PROFOUND
TENDERNESS AND THE MUTE DESPAIR OF AN ELDERLY KINDLY OLD MAN WHO IS
ABOUT TO VANISH IN THE DARK
HE BEGAN TO LOSE HIS TEETH WHICH ADDED TO HIS SADNESS
M
GILLENORMAND WITHOUT HOWEVER ACKNOWLEDGING IT TO HIMSELF FOR IT
WOULD HAVE RENDERED HIM FURIOUS AND ASHAMED HAD NEVER LOVED A MISTRESS
AS HE LOVED MARIUS
HE HAD HAD PLACED IN HIS CHAMBER OPPOSITE THE HEAD OF HIS BED SO THAT
IT SHOULD BE THE FIRST THING ON WHICH HIS EYES FELL ON WAKING AN
OLD PORTRAIT OF HIS OTHER DAUGHTER WHO WAS DEAD MADAME PONTMERCY
A PORTRAIT WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN WHEN SHE WAS EIGHTEEN
HE GAZED
INCESSANTLY AT THAT PORTRAIT
ONE DAY HE HAPPENED TO SAY AS HE GAZED
UPON IT
I THINK THE LIKENESS IS STRONG
TO MY SISTER INQUIRED MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND
YES CERTAINLY
THE OLD MAN ADDED
AND TO HIM ALSO
ONCE AS HE SAT WITH HIS KNEES PRESSED TOGETHER AND HIS EYES ALMOST
CLOSED IN A DESPONDENT ATTITUDE HIS DAUGHTER VENTURED TO SAY TO HIM
FATHER ARE YOU AS ANGRY WITH HIM AS EVER
SHE PAUSED NOT DARING TO PROCEED FURTHER
WITH WHOM HE DEMANDED
WITH THAT POOR MARIUS
HE RAISED HIS AGED HEAD LAID HIS WITHERED AND EMACIATED FIST ON THE
TABLE AND EXCLAIMED IN HIS MOST IRRITATED AND VIBRATING TONE
POOR MARIUS DO YOU SAY THAT GENTLEMAN IS A KNAVE A WRETCHED
SCOUNDREL A VAIN LITTLE INGRATE A HEARTLESS SOULLESS HAUGHTY AND
WICKED MAN
AND HE TURNED AWAY SO THAT HIS DAUGHTER MIGHT NOT SEE THE TEAR THAT
STOOD IN HIS EYE
THREE DAYS LATER HE BROKE A SILENCE WHICH HAD LASTED FOUR HOURS TO SAY
TO HIS DAUGHTER POINT BLANK
I HAD THE HONOR TO ASK MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND NEVER TO MENTION HIM
TO ME
AUNT GILLENORMAND RENOUNCED EVERY EFFORT AND PRONOUNCED THIS ACUTE
DIAGNOSIS MY FATHER NEVER CARED VERY MUCH FOR MY SISTER AFTER HER
FOLLY
IT IS CLEAR THAT HE DETESTS MARIUS
AFTER HER FOLLY MEANT AFTER SHE HAD MARRIED THE COLONEL
HOWEVER AS THE READER HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONJECTURE MADEMOISELLE
GILLENORMAND HAD FAILED IN HER ATTEMPT TO SUBSTITUTE HER FAVORITE THE
OFFICER OF LANCERS FOR MARIUS
THE SUBSTITUTE THEODULE HAD NOT BEEN A
SUCCESS
M
GILLENORMAND HAD NOT ACCEPTED THE QUID PRO QUO
A VACANCY
IN THE HEART DOES NOT ACCOMMODATE ITSELF TO A STOP GAP
THEODULE ON HIS
SIDE THOUGH HE SCENTED THE INHERITANCE WAS DISGUSTED AT THE TASK
OF PLEASING
THE GOODMAN BORED THE LANCER AND THE LANCER SHOCKED THE
GOODMAN
LIEUTENANT THEODULE WAS GAY NO DOUBT BUT A CHATTER BOX
FRIVOLOUS BUT VULGAR A HIGH LIVER BUT A FREQUENTER OF BAD COMPANY HE
HAD MISTRESSES IT IS TRUE AND HE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO SAY ABOUT THEM
IT IS TRUE ALSO BUT HE TALKED BADLY
ALL HIS GOOD QUALITIES HAD A
DEFECT
M
GILLENORMAND WAS WORN OUT WITH HEARING HIM TELL ABOUT THE
LOVE AFFAIRS THAT HE HAD IN THE VICINITY OF THE BARRACKS IN THE RUE
DE BABYLONE
AND THEN LIEUTENANT GILLENORMAND SOMETIMES CAME IN HIS
UNIFORM WITH THE TRICOLORED COCKADE
THIS RENDERED HIM DOWNRIGHT
INTOLERABLE
FINALLY FATHER GILLENORMAND HAD SAID TO HIS DAUGHTER
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT THEODULE
I HAVEN'T MUCH TASTE FOR WARRIORS
IN TIME OF PEACE
RECEIVE HIM IF YOU CHOOSE
I DON'T KNOW BUT I PREFER
SLASHERS TO FELLOWS THAT DRAG THEIR SWORDS
THE CLASH OF BLADES IN
BATTLE IS LESS DISMAL AFTER ALL THAN THE CLANK OF THE SCABBARD ON
THE PAVEMENT
AND THEN THROWING OUT YOUR CHEST LIKE A BULLY AND
LACING YOURSELF LIKE A GIRL WITH STAYS UNDER YOUR CUIRASS IS DOUBLY
RIDICULOUS
WHEN ONE IS A VERITABLE MAN ONE HOLDS EQUALLY ALOOF
FROM SWAGGER AND FROM AFFECTED AIRS
HE IS NEITHER A BLUSTERER NOR A
FINNICKY HEARTED MAN
KEEP YOUR THEODULE FOR YOURSELF
IT WAS IN VAIN THAT HIS DAUGHTER SAID TO HIM BUT HE IS YOUR
GRANDNEPHEW NEVERTHELESS IT TURNED OUT THAT M
GILLENORMAND WHO
WAS A GRANDFATHER TO THE VERY FINGER TIPS WAS NOT IN THE LEAST A
GRAND UNCLE
IN FACT AS HE HAD GOOD SENSE AND AS HE HAD COMPARED THE TWO THEODULE
HAD ONLY SERVED TO MAKE HIM REGRET MARIUS ALL THE MORE
ONE EVENING IT WAS THE 24TH OF JUNE WHICH DID NOT PREVENT FATHER
GILLENORMAND HAVING A ROUSING FIRE ON THE HEARTH HE HAD DISMISSED HIS
DAUGHTER WHO WAS SEWING IN A NEIGHBORING APARTMENT
HE WAS ALONE IN
HIS CHAMBER AMID ITS PASTORAL SCENES WITH HIS FEET PROPPED ON THE
ANDIRONS HALF ENVELOPED IN HIS HUGE SCREEN OF COROMANDEL LACQUER WITH
ITS NINE LEAVES WITH HIS ELBOW RESTING ON A TABLE WHERE BURNED TWO
CANDLES UNDER A GREEN SHADE ENGULFED IN HIS TAPESTRY ARMCHAIR AND IN
HIS HAND A BOOK WHICH HE WAS NOT READING
HE WAS DRESSED ACCORDING
TO HIS WONT LIKE AN INCROYABLE AND RESEMBLED AN ANTIQUE PORTRAIT BY
GARAT
THIS WOULD HAVE MADE PEOPLE RUN AFTER HIM IN THE STREET HAD NOT
HIS DAUGHTER COVERED HIM UP WHENEVER HE WENT OUT IN A VAST BISHOP'S
WADDED CLOAK WHICH CONCEALED HIS ATTIRE
AT HOME HE NEVER WORE A
DRESSING GOWN EXCEPT WHEN HE ROSE AND RETIRED
IT GIVES ONE A LOOK OF
AGE SAID HE
FATHER GILLENORMAND WAS THINKING OF MARIUS LOVINGLY AND BITTERLY AND
AS USUAL BITTERNESS PREDOMINATED
HIS TENDERNESS ONCE SOURED ALWAYS
ENDED BY BOILING AND TURNING TO INDIGNATION
HE HAD REACHED THE POINT
WHERE A MAN TRIES TO MAKE UP HIS MIND AND TO ACCEPT THAT WHICH RENDS HIS
HEART
HE WAS EXPLAINING TO HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY REASON
WHY MARIUS SHOULD RETURN THAT IF HE INTENDED TO RETURN HE SHOULD
HAVE DONE IT LONG AGO THAT HE MUST RENOUNCE THE IDEA
HE WAS TRYING TO
ACCUSTOM HIMSELF TO THE THOUGHT THAT ALL WAS OVER AND THAT HE SHOULD
DIE WITHOUT HAVING BEHELD THAT GENTLEMAN AGAIN
BUT HIS WHOLE NATURE
REVOLTED HIS AGED PATERNITY WOULD NOT CONSENT TO THIS
WELL SAID
HE THIS WAS HIS DOLEFUL REFRAIN HE WILL NOT RETURN HIS BALD HEAD
HAD FALLEN UPON HIS BREAST AND HE FIXED A MELANCHOLY AND IRRITATED GAZE
UPON THE ASHES ON HIS HEARTH
IN THE VERY MIDST OF HIS REVERY HIS OLD SERVANT BASQUE ENTERED AND
INQUIRED
CAN MONSIEUR RECEIVE M
MARIUS
THE OLD MAN SAT UP ERECT PALLID AND LIKE A CORPSE WHICH RISES UNDER
THE INFLUENCE OF A GALVANIC SHOCK
ALL HIS BLOOD HAD RETREATED TO HIS
HEART
HE STAMMERED
M
MARIUS WHAT
I DON'T KNOW REPLIED BASQUE INTIMIDATED AND PUT OUT OF COUNTENANCE
BY HIS MASTER'S AIR I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM
NICOLETTE CAME IN AND SAID TO
ME 'THERE'S A YOUNG MAN HERE SAY THAT IT IS M
MARIUS
FATHER GILLENORMAND STAMMERED IN A LOW VOICE
SHOW HIM IN
AND HE REMAINED IN THE SAME ATTITUDE WITH SHAKING HEAD AND HIS EYES
FIXED ON THE DOOR
IT OPENED ONCE MORE
A YOUNG MAN ENTERED
IT WAS
MARIUS
MARIUS HALTED AT THE DOOR AS THOUGH WAITING TO BE BIDDEN TO ENTER
HIS ALMOST SQUALID ATTIRE WAS NOT PERCEPTIBLE IN THE OBSCURITY CAUSED BY
THE SHADE
NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT HIS CALM GRAVE BUT STRANGELY SAD
FACE
IT WAS SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE FATHER GILLENORMAND DULLED WITH AMAZEMENT
AND JOY COULD SEE ANYTHING EXCEPT A BRIGHTNESS AS WHEN ONE IS IN THE
PRESENCE OF AN APPARITION
HE WAS ON THE POINT OF SWOONING HE SAW
MARIUS THROUGH A DAZZLING LIGHT
IT CERTAINLY WAS HE IT CERTAINLY WAS
MARIUS
AT LAST AFTER THE LAPSE OF FOUR YEARS HE GRASPED HIM ENTIRE SO TO
SPEAK IN A SINGLE GLANCE
HE FOUND HIM NOBLE HANDSOME DISTINGUISHED
WELL GROWN A COMPLETE MAN WITH A SUITABLE MIEN AND A CHARMING AIR
HE
FELT A DESIRE TO OPEN HIS ARMS TO CALL HIM TO FLING HIMSELF FORWARD
HIS HEART MELTED WITH RAPTURE AFFECTIONATE WORDS SWELLED AND OVERFLOWED
HIS BREAST AT LENGTH ALL HIS TENDERNESS CAME TO THE LIGHT AND REACHED
HIS LIPS AND BY A CONTRAST WHICH CONSTITUTED THE VERY FOUNDATION OF
HIS NATURE WHAT CAME FORTH WAS HARSHNESS
HE SAID ABRUPTLY
WHAT HAVE YOU COME HERE FOR
MARIUS REPLIED WITH EMBARRASSMENT
MONSIEUR
M
GILLENORMAND WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE MARIUS THROW HIMSELF INTO HIS
ARMS
HE WAS DISPLEASED WITH MARIUS AND WITH HIMSELF
HE WAS CONSCIOUS
THAT HE WAS BRUSQUE AND THAT MARIUS WAS COLD
IT CAUSED THE GOODMAN
UNENDURABLE AND IRRITATING ANXIETY TO FEEL SO TENDER AND FORLORN
WITHIN AND ONLY TO BE ABLE TO BE HARD OUTSIDE
BITTERNESS RETURNED
HE
INTERRUPTED MARIUS IN A PEEVISH TONE
THEN WHY DID YOU COME
THAT THEN SIGNIFIED IF YOU DO NOT COME TO EMBRACE ME
MARIUS LOOKED
AT HIS GRANDFATHER WHOSE PALLOR GAVE HIM A FACE OF MARBLE
MONSIEUR
HAVE YOU COME TO BEG MY PARDON DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR FAULTS
HE THOUGHT HE WAS PUTTING MARIUS ON THE RIGHT ROAD AND THAT THE CHILD
WOULD YIELD
MARIUS SHIVERED IT WAS THE DENIAL OF HIS FATHER THAT WAS
REQUIRED OF HIM HE DROPPED HIS EYES AND REPLIED
NO SIR
THEN EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN IMPETUOUSLY WITH A GRIEF THAT WAS
POIGNANT AND FULL OF WRATH WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME
MARIUS CLASPED HIS HANDS ADVANCED A STEP AND SAID IN A FEEBLE AND
TREMBLING VOICE
SIR HAVE PITY ON ME
THESE WORDS TOUCHED M
GILLENORMAND UTTERED A LITTLE SOONER THEY WOULD
HAVE RENDERED HIM TENDER BUT THEY CAME TOO LATE
THE GRANDFATHER ROSE
HE SUPPORTED HIMSELF WITH BOTH HANDS ON HIS CANE HIS LIPS WERE WHITE
HIS BROW WAVERED BUT HIS LOFTY FORM TOWERED ABOVE MARIUS AS HE BOWED
PITY ON YOU SIR IT IS YOUTH DEMANDING PITY OF THE OLD MAN OF
NINETY ONE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO LIFE I AM LEAVING IT YOU GO TO THE
PLAY TO BALLS TO THE CAFE TO THE BILLIARD HALL YOU HAVE WIT YOU
PLEASE THE WOMEN YOU ARE A HANDSOME FELLOW AS FOR ME I SPIT ON MY
BRANDS IN THE HEART OF SUMMER YOU ARE RICH WITH THE ONLY RICHES THAT
ARE REALLY SUCH I POSSESS ALL THE POVERTY OF AGE INFIRMITY ISOLATION
YOU HAVE YOUR THIRTY TWO TEETH A GOOD DIGESTION BRIGHT EYES STRENGTH
APPETITE HEALTH GAYETY A FOREST OF BLACK HAIR I HAVE NO LONGER EVEN
WHITE HAIR I HAVE LOST MY TEETH I AM LOSING MY LEGS I AM LOSING MY
MEMORY THERE ARE THREE NAMES OF STREETS THAT I CONFOUND INCESSANTLY
THE RUE CHARLOT THE RUE DU CHAUME AND THE RUE SAINT CLAUDE THAT
IS WHAT I HAVE COME TO YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU THE WHOLE FUTURE FULL OF
SUNSHINE AND I AM BEGINNING TO LOSE MY SIGHT SO FAR AM I ADVANCING
INTO THE NIGHT YOU ARE IN LOVE THAT IS A MATTER OF COURSE I AM
BELOVED BY NO ONE IN ALL THE WORLD AND YOU ASK PITY OF ME PARBLEU
MOLIERE FORGOT THAT
IF THAT IS THE WAY YOU JEST AT THE COURTHOUSE
MESSIEURS THE LAWYERS I SINCERELY COMPLIMENT YOU
YOU ARE DROLL
AND THE OCTOGENARIAN WENT ON IN A GRAVE AND ANGRY VOICE
COME NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME
SIR SAID MARIUS I KNOW THAT MY PRESENCE IS DISPLEASING TO YOU BUT
I HAVE COME MERELY TO ASK ONE THING OF YOU AND THEN I SHALL GO AWAY
IMMEDIATELY
YOU ARE A FOOL SAID THE OLD MAN
WHO SAID THAT YOU WERE TO GO AWAY
THIS WAS THE TRANSLATION OF THE TENDER WORDS WHICH LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF
HIS HEART
ASK MY PARDON THROW YOURSELF ON MY NECK
M
GILLENORMAND FELT THAT MARIUS WOULD LEAVE HIM IN A FEW MOMENTS THAT
HIS HARSH RECEPTION HAD REPELLED THE LAD THAT HIS HARDNESS WAS DRIVING
HIM AWAY HE SAID ALL THIS TO HIMSELF AND IT AUGMENTED HIS GRIEF AND
AS HIS GRIEF WAS STRAIGHTWAY CONVERTED INTO WRATH IT INCREASED HIS
HARSHNESS
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE MARIUS UNDERSTAND AND MARIUS DID
NOT UNDERSTAND WHICH MADE THE GOODMAN FURIOUS
HE BEGAN AGAIN
WHAT YOU DESERTED ME YOUR GRANDFATHER YOU LEFT MY HOUSE TO GO NO
ONE KNOWS WHITHER YOU DROVE YOUR AUNT TO DESPAIR YOU WENT OFF IT IS
EASILY GUESSED TO LEAD A BACHELOR LIFE IT'S MORE CONVENIENT TO PLAY
THE DANDY TO COME IN AT ALL HOURS TO AMUSE YOURSELF YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
NO SIGNS OF LIFE YOU HAVE CONTRACTED DEBTS WITHOUT EVEN TELLING ME TO
PAY THEM YOU HAVE BECOME A SMASHER OF WINDOWS AND A BLUSTERER AND AT
THE END OF FOUR YEARS YOU COME TO ME AND THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY
TO ME
THIS VIOLENT FASHION OF DRIVING A GRANDSON TO TENDERNESS WAS PRODUCTIVE
ONLY OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF MARIUS
M
GILLENORMAND FOLDED HIS ARMS
A GESTURE WHICH WITH HIM WAS PECULIARLY IMPERIOUS AND APOSTROPHIZED
MARIUS BITTERLY
LET US MAKE AN END OF THIS
YOU HAVE COME TO ASK SOMETHING OF ME YOU
SAY WELL WHAT WHAT IS IT SPEAK
SIR SAID MARIUS WITH THE LOOK OF A MAN WHO FEELS THAT HE IS FALLING
OVER A PRECIPICE I HAVE COME TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO MARRY
M
GILLENORMAND RANG THE BELL
BASQUE OPENED THE DOOR HALF WAY
CALL MY DAUGHTER
A SECOND LATER THE DOOR WAS OPENED ONCE MORE MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND
DID NOT ENTER BUT SHOWED HERSELF MARIUS WAS STANDING MUTE WITH
PENDANT ARMS AND THE FACE OF A CRIMINAL M
GILLENORMAND WAS PACING BACK
AND FORTH IN THE ROOM
HE TURNED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND SAID TO HER
NOTHING
IT IS MONSIEUR MARIUS
SAY GOOD DAY TO HIM
MONSIEUR WISHES TO
MARRY
THAT'S ALL
GO AWAY
THE CURT HOARSE SOUND OF THE OLD MAN'S VOICE ANNOUNCED A STRANGE DEGREE
OF EXCITEMENT
THE AUNT GAZED AT MARIUS WITH A FRIGHTENED AIR HARDLY
APPEARED TO RECOGNIZE HIM DID NOT ALLOW A GESTURE OR A SYLLABLE TO
ESCAPE HER AND DISAPPEARED AT HER FATHER'S BREATH MORE SWIFTLY THAN A
STRAW BEFORE THE HURRICANE
IN THE MEANTIME FATHER GILLENORMAND HAD RETURNED AND PLACED HIS BACK
AGAINST THE CHIMNEY PIECE ONCE MORE
YOU MARRY AT ONE AND TWENTY YOU HAVE ARRANGED THAT YOU HAVE ONLY
A PERMISSION TO ASK A FORMALITY

CONSENT TO IT AND THE OLD FOSSIL WILL CONSENT GO MY LAD DO AS
YOU LIKE ATTACH YOUR PAVING STONE MARRY YOUR POUSSELEVENT YOUR
COUPELEVENT NEVER SIR NEVER
FATHER
NEVER
AT THE TONE IN WHICH THAT NEVER WAS UTTERED MARIUS LOST ALL HOPE
HE
TRAVERSED THE CHAMBER WITH SLOW STEPS WITH BOWED HEAD TOTTERING AND
MORE LIKE A DYING MAN THAN LIKE ONE MERELY TAKING HIS DEPARTURE
M
GILLENORMAND FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES AND AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE
DOOR OPENED AND MARIUS WAS ON THE POINT OF GOING OUT HE ADVANCED FOUR
PACES WITH THE SENILE VIVACITY OF IMPETUOUS AND SPOILED OLD GENTLEMEN
SEIZED MARIUS BY THE COLLAR BROUGHT HIM BACK ENERGETICALLY INTO THE
ROOM FLUNG HIM INTO AN ARMCHAIR AND SAID TO HIM
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT
IT WAS THAT SINGLE WORD FATHER WHICH HAD EFFECTED THIS REVOLUTION
MARIUS STARED AT HIM IN BEWILDERMENT
M
GILLENORMAND'S MOBILE FACE WAS
NO LONGER EXPRESSIVE OF ANYTHING BUT ROUGH AND INEFFABLE GOOD NATURE
THE GRANDSIRE HAD GIVEN WAY BEFORE THE GRANDFATHER
COME SEE HERE SPEAK TELL ME ABOUT YOUR LOVE AFFAIRS JABBER TELL ME
EVERYTHING SAPRISTI HOW STUPID YOUNG FOLKS ARE
FATHER REPEATED MARIUS
THE OLD MAN'S ENTIRE COUNTENANCE LIGHTED UP WITH INDESCRIBABLE RADIANCE
YES THAT'S RIGHT CALL ME FATHER AND YOU'LL SEE
THERE WAS NOW SOMETHING SO KIND SO GENTLE SO OPENHEARTED AND SO
PATERNAL IN THIS BRUSQUENESS THAT MARIUS IN THE SUDDEN TRANSITION FROM
DISCOURAGEMENT TO HOPE WAS STUNNED AND INTOXICATED BY IT AS IT WERE
HE WAS SEATED NEAR THE TABLE THE LIGHT FROM THE CANDLES BROUGHT OUT
THE DILAPIDATION OF HIS COSTUME WHICH FATHER GILLENORMAND REGARDED WITH
AMAZEMENT
WELL FATHER SAID MARIUS
AH BY THE WAY INTERRUPTED M
GILLENORMAND YOU REALLY HAVE NOT A
PENNY THEN YOU ARE DRESSED LIKE A PICKPOCKET
HE RUMMAGED IN A DRAWER DREW FORTH A PURSE WHICH HE LAID ON THE TABLE
HERE ARE A HUNDRED LOUIS BUY YOURSELF A HAT
FATHER PURSUED MARIUS MY GOOD FATHER IF YOU ONLY KNEW I LOVE HER
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE IT THE FIRST TIME I SAW HER WAS AT THE LUXEMBOURG
SHE CAME THERE IN THE BEGINNING I DID NOT PAY MUCH HEED TO HER AND
THEN I DON'T KNOW HOW IT CAME ABOUT I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER
OH HOW
UNHAPPY THAT MADE ME NOW AT LAST I SEE HER EVERY DAY AT HER OWN
HOME HER FATHER DOES NOT KNOW IT JUST FANCY THEY ARE GOING AWAY IT
IS IN THE GARDEN THAT WE MEET IN THE EVENING HER FATHER MEANS TO TAKE
HER TO ENGLAND THEN I SAID TO MYSELF 'I'LL GO AND SEE MY GRANDFATHER
AND TELL HIM ALL ABOUT THE AFFAIR
I SHOULD GO MAD FIRST I SHOULD DIE
I SHOULD FALL ILL I SHOULD THROW MYSELF INTO THE WATER
I ABSOLUTELY
MUST MARRY HER SINCE I SHOULD GO MAD OTHERWISE THIS IS THE WHOLE
TRUTH AND I DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE OMITTED ANYTHING
SHE LIVES IN A
GARDEN WITH AN IRON FENCE IN THE RUE PLUMET
IT IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF THE INVALIDES
FATHER GILLENORMAND HAD SEATED HIMSELF WITH A BEAMING COUNTENANCE
BESIDE MARIUS
AS HE LISTENED TO HIM AND DRANK IN THE SOUND OF HIS
VOICE HE ENJOYED AT THE SAME TIME A PROTRACTED PINCH OF SNUFF
AT
THE WORDS RUE PLUMET HE INTERRUPTED HIS INHALATION AND ALLOWED THE
REMAINDER OF HIS SNUFF TO FALL UPON HIS KNEES
THE RUE PLUMET THE RUE PLUMET DID YOU SAY LET US SEE ARE THERE
NOT BARRACKS IN THAT VICINITY WHY YES THAT'S IT
YOUR COUSIN
THEODULE HAS SPOKEN TO ME ABOUT IT
THE LANCER THE OFFICER
A GAY GIRL
MY GOOD FRIEND A GAY GIRL PARDIEU YES THE RUE PLUMET
IT IS WHAT
USED TO BE CALLED THE RUE BLOMET IT ALL COMES BACK TO ME NOW
I HAVE
HEARD OF THAT LITTLE GIRL OF THE IRON RAILING IN THE RUE PLUMET
IN A
GARDEN A PAMELA
YOUR TASTE IS NOT BAD
SHE IS SAID TO BE A VERY TIDY
CREATURE
BETWEEN OURSELVES I THINK THAT SIMPLETON OF A LANCER HAS BEEN
COURTING HER A BIT
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE DID IT
HOWEVER THAT'S NOT
TO THE PURPOSE
BESIDES HE IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED
HE BRAGS MARIUS I
THINK IT QUITE PROPER THAT A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU SHOULD BE IN LOVE
IT'S
THE RIGHT THING AT YOUR AGE
I LIKE YOU BETTER AS A LOVER THAN AS A
JACOBIN
I LIKE YOU BETTER IN LOVE WITH A PETTICOAT SAPRISTI WITH
TWENTY PETTICOATS THAN WITH M
DE ROBESPIERRE
FOR MY PART I WILL DO
MYSELF THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT IN THE LINE OF SANS CULOTTES I HAVE
NEVER LOVED ANY ONE BUT WOMEN
PRETTY GIRLS ARE PRETTY GIRLS THE DEUCE
THERE'S NO OBJECTION TO THAT
AS FOR THE LITTLE ONE SHE RECEIVES YOU
WITHOUT HER FATHER'S KNOWLEDGE
THAT'S IN THE ESTABLISHED ORDER OF
THINGS
I HAVE HAD ADVENTURES OF THAT SAME SORT MYSELF
MORE THAN ONE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS DONE THEN ONE DOES NOT TAKE THE MATTER FEROCIOUSLY
ONE DOES NOT PRECIPITATE HIMSELF INTO THE TRAGIC ONE DOES NOT MAKE
ONE'S MIND TO MARRIAGE AND M
LE MAIRE WITH HIS SCARF
ONE SIMPLY
BEHAVES LIKE A FELLOW OF SPIRIT
ONE SHOWS GOOD SENSE
SLIP ALONG
MORTALS DON'T MARRY
YOU COME AND LOOK UP YOUR GRANDFATHER WHO IS A
GOOD NATURED FELLOW AT BOTTOM AND WHO ALWAYS HAS A FEW ROLLS OF LOUIS
IN AN OLD DRAWER YOU SAY TO HIM 'SEE HERE GRANDFATHER AND THE
GRANDFATHER SAYS 'THAT'S A SIMPLE MATTER
YOUTH MUST AMUSE ITSELF AND
OLD AGE MUST WEAR OUT
I HAVE BEEN YOUNG YOU WILL BE OLD
COME MY BOY
YOU SHALL PASS IT ON TO YOUR GRANDSON
HERE ARE TWO HUNDRED PISTOLES
AMUSE YOURSELF DEUCE TAKE IT NOTHING BETTER THAT'S THE WAY THE
AFFAIR SHOULD BE TREATED
YOU DON'T MARRY BUT THAT DOES NO HARM
YOU
UNDERSTAND ME
MARIUS PETRIFIED AND INCAPABLE OF UTTERING A SYLLABLE MADE A SIGN WITH
HIS HEAD THAT HE DID NOT
THE OLD MAN BURST OUT LAUGHING WINKED HIS AGED EYE GAVE HIM A SLAP ON
THE KNEE STARED HIM FULL IN THE FACE WITH A MYSTERIOUS AND BEAMING AIR
AND SAID TO HIM WITH THE TENDEREST OF SHRUGS OF THE SHOULDER
BOOBY MAKE HER YOUR MISTRESS
MARIUS TURNED PALE
HE HAD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF WHAT HIS GRANDFATHER
HAD JUST SAID
THIS TWADDLE ABOUT THE RUE BLOMET PAMELA THE BARRACKS
THE LANCER HAD PASSED BEFORE MARIUS LIKE A DISSOLVING VIEW
NOTHING OF
ALL THAT COULD BEAR ANY REFERENCE TO COSETTE WHO WAS A LILY
THE GOOD
MAN WAS WANDERING IN HIS MIND
BUT THIS WANDERING TERMINATED IN WORDS
WHICH MARIUS DID UNDERSTAND AND WHICH WERE A MORTAL INSULT TO COSETTE
THOSE WORDS MAKE HER YOUR MISTRESS ENTERED THE HEART OF THE STRICT
YOUNG MAN LIKE A SWORD
HE ROSE PICKED UP HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE FLOOR AND WALKED TO THE
DOOR WITH A FIRM ASSURED STEP
THERE HE TURNED ROUND BOWED DEEPLY TO
HIS GRANDFATHER RAISED HIS HEAD ERECT AGAIN AND SAID
FIVE YEARS AGO YOU INSULTED MY FATHER TO DAY YOU HAVE INSULTED MY
WIFE
I ASK NOTHING MORE OF YOU SIR
FAREWELL
FATHER GILLENORMAND UTTERLY CONFOUNDED OPENED HIS MOUTH EXTENDED HIS
ARMS TRIED TO RISE AND BEFORE HE COULD UTTER A WORD THE DOOR CLOSED
ONCE MORE AND MARIUS HAD DISAPPEARED
THE OLD MAN REMAINED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES MOTIONLESS AND AS THOUGH
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING WITHOUT THE POWER TO SPEAK OR BREATHE AS THOUGH
A CLENCHED FIST GRASPED HIS THROAT
AT LAST HE TORE HIMSELF FROM HIS
ARM CHAIR RAN SO FAR AS A MAN CAN RUN AT NINETY ONE TO THE DOOR
OPENED IT AND CRIED
HELP HELP
HIS DAUGHTER MADE HER APPEARANCE THEN THE DOMESTICS
HE BEGAN AGAIN
WITH A PITIFUL RATTLE RUN AFTER HIM BRING HIM BACK WHAT HAVE I DONE
TO HIM HE IS MAD HE IS GOING AWAY AH MY GOD AH MY GOD THIS TIME
HE WILL NOT COME BACK
HE WENT TO THE WINDOW WHICH LOOKED OUT ON THE STREET THREW IT OPEN WITH
HIS AGED AND PALSIED HANDS LEANED OUT MORE THAN HALF WAY WHILE BASQUE
AND NICOLETTE HELD HIM BEHIND AND SHOUTED
MARIUS MARIUS MARIUS MARIUS
BUT MARIUS COULD NO LONGER HEAR HIM FOR AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS TURNING
THE CORNER OF THE RUE SAINT LOUIS
THE OCTOGENARIAN RAISED HIS HANDS TO HIS TEMPLES TWO OR THREE TIMES
WITH AN EXPRESSION OF ANGUISH RECOILED TOTTERING AND FELL BACK INTO AN
ARM CHAIR PULSELESS VOICELESS TEARLESS WITH QUIVERING HEAD AND LIPS
WHICH MOVED WITH A STUPID AIR WITH NOTHING IN HIS EYES AND NOTHING
ANY LONGER IN HIS HEART EXCEPT A GLOOMY AND PROFOUND SOMETHING WHICH
RESEMBLED NIGHT
BOOK NINTH WHITHER ARE THEY GOING
CHAPTER I JEAN VALJEAN
THAT SAME DAY TOWARDS FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON JEAN VALJEAN WAS
SITTING ALONE ON THE BACK SIDE OF ONE OF THE MOST SOLITARY SLOPES IN THE
CHAMP DE MARS
EITHER FROM PRUDENCE OR FROM A DESIRE TO MEDITATE OR
SIMPLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF ONE OF THOSE INSENSIBLE CHANGES OF HABIT WHICH
GRADUALLY INTRODUCE THEMSELVES INTO THE EXISTENCE OF EVERY ONE HE NOW
RARELY WENT OUT WITH COSETTE
HE HAD ON HIS WORKMAN'S WAISTCOAT
AND TROUSERS OF GRAY LINEN AND HIS LONG VISORED CAP CONCEALED HIS
COUNTENANCE
HE WAS CALM AND HAPPY NOW BESIDE COSETTE THAT WHICH HAD FOR A TIME
ALARMED AND TROUBLED HIM HAD BEEN DISSIPATED BUT FOR THE LAST WEEK OR
TWO ANXIETIES OF ANOTHER NATURE HAD COME UP
ONE DAY WHILE WALKING
ON THE BOULEVARD HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THENARDIER THANKS TO HIS
DISGUISE THENARDIER HAD NOT RECOGNIZED HIM BUT SINCE THAT DAY JEAN
VALJEAN HAD SEEN HIM REPEATEDLY AND HE WAS NOW CERTAIN THAT THENARDIER
WAS PROWLING ABOUT IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD
THIS HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO MAKE HIM COME TO A DECISION
MOREOVER PARIS WAS NOT TRANQUIL POLITICAL TROUBLES PRESENTED THIS
INCONVENIENT FEATURE FOR ANY ONE WHO HAD ANYTHING TO CONCEAL IN HIS
LIFE THAT THE POLICE HAD GROWN VERY UNEASY AND VERY SUSPICIOUS AND
THAT WHILE SEEKING TO FERRET OUT A MAN LIKE PEPIN OR MOREY THEY MIGHT
VERY READILY DISCOVER A MAN LIKE JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO QUIT PARIS AND EVEN FRANCE AND GO
OVER TO ENGLAND
HE HAD WARNED COSETTE
HE WISHED TO SET OUT BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK
HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON THE SLOPE IN THE CHAMP DE MARS TURNING OVER
ALL SORTS OF THOUGHTS IN HIS MIND THENARDIER THE POLICE THE JOURNEY
AND THE DIFFICULTY OF PROCURING A PASSPORT
HE WAS TROUBLED FROM ALL THESE POINTS OF VIEW
LAST OF ALL AN INEXPLICABLE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAD JUST ATTRACTED HIS
ATTENTION AND FROM WHICH HE HAD NOT YET RECOVERED HAD ADDED TO HIS
STATE OF ALARM
ON THE MORNING OF THAT VERY DAY WHEN HE ALONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD WAS
STIRRING WHILE STROLLING IN THE GARDEN BEFORE COSETTE'S SHUTTERS
WERE OPEN HE HAD SUDDENLY PERCEIVED ON THE WALL THE FOLLOWING LINE
ENGRAVED PROBABLY WITH A NAIL
16 RUE DE LA VERRERIE
THIS WAS PERFECTLY FRESH THE GROOVES IN THE ANCIENT BLACK MORTAR WERE
WHITE A TUFT OF NETTLES AT THE FOOT OF THE WALL WAS POWDERED WITH THE
FINE FRESH PLASTER
THIS HAD PROBABLY BEEN WRITTEN ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT
WHAT WAS THIS A SIGNAL FOR OTHERS A WARNING FOR HIMSELF
IN ANY CASE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE GARDEN HAD BEEN VIOLATED AND THAT
STRANGERS HAD MADE THEIR WAY INTO IT
HE RECALLED THE ODD INCIDENTS WHICH HAD ALREADY ALARMED THE HOUSEHOLD
HIS MIND WAS NOW FILLING IN THIS CANVAS
HE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO SPEAK TO COSETTE OF THE LINE WRITTEN ON THE
WALL FOR FEAR OF ALARMING HER
IN THE MIDST OF HIS PREOCCUPATIONS HE PERCEIVED FROM A SHADOW CAST BY
THE SUN THAT SOME ONE HAD HALTED ON THE CREST OF THE SLOPE IMMEDIATELY
BEHIND HIM
HE WAS ON THE POINT OF TURNING ROUND WHEN A PAPER FOLDED IN FOUR FELL
UPON HIS KNEES AS THOUGH A HAND HAD DROPPED IT OVER HIS HEAD
HE TOOK THE PAPER UNFOLDED IT AND READ THESE WORDS WRITTEN IN LARGE
CHARACTERS WITH A PENCIL
MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE
JEAN VALJEAN SPRANG HASTILY TO HIS FEET THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE SLOPE
HE GAZED ALL AROUND HIM AND PERCEIVED A CREATURE LARGER THAN A
CHILD NOT SO LARGE AS A MAN CLAD IN A GRAY BLOUSE AND TROUSERS OF
DUST COLORED COTTON VELVET WHO WAS JUMPING OVER THE PARAPET AND WHO
SLIPPED INTO THE MOAT OF THE CHAMPDE MARS
JEAN VALJEAN RETURNED HOME AT ONCE IN A VERY THOUGHTFUL MOOD
CHAPTER II MARIUS
MARIUS HAD LEFT M
GILLENORMAND IN DESPAIR
HE HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE
WITH VERY LITTLE HOPE AND QUITTED IT WITH IMMENSE DESPAIR
HOWEVER AND THOSE WHO HAVE OBSERVED THE DEPTHS OF THE HUMAN HEART WILL
UNDERSTAND THIS THE OFFICER THE LANCER THE NINNY COUSIN THEODULE
HAD LEFT NO TRACE IN HIS MIND
NOT THE SLIGHTEST
THE DRAMATIC POET
MIGHT APPARENTLY EXPECT SOME COMPLICATIONS FROM THIS REVELATION MADE
POINT BLANK BY THE GRANDFATHER TO THE GRANDSON
BUT WHAT THE DRAMA WOULD
GAIN THEREBY TRUTH WOULD LOSE
MARIUS WAS AT AN AGE WHEN ONE BELIEVES
NOTHING IN THE LINE OF EVIL LATER ON COMES THE AGE WHEN ONE BELIEVES
EVERYTHING
SUSPICIONS ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN WRINKLES
EARLY YOUTH
HAS NONE OF THEM
THAT WHICH OVERWHELMED OTHELLO GLIDES INNOCUOUS OVER
CANDIDE
SUSPECT COSETTE THERE ARE HOSTS OF CRIMES WHICH MARIUS COULD
SOONER HAVE COMMITTED
HE BEGAN TO WANDER ABOUT THE STREETS THE RESOURCE OF THOSE WHO SUFFER
HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING SO FAR AS HE COULD AFTERWARDS REMEMBER
AT TWO
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING HE RETURNED TO COURFEYRAC'S QUARTERS AND FLUNG
HIMSELF WITHOUT UNDRESSING ON HIS MATTRESS
THE SUN WAS SHINING
BRIGHTLY WHEN HE SANK INTO THAT FRIGHTFUL LEADEN SLUMBER WHICH PERMITS
IDEAS TO GO AND COME IN THE BRAIN
WHEN HE AWOKE HE SAW COURFEYRAC
ENJOLRAS FEUILLY AND COMBEFERRE STANDING IN THE ROOM WITH THEIR HATS
ON AND ALL READY TO GO OUT
COURFEYRAC SAID TO HIM
ARE YOU COMING TO GENERAL LAMARQUE'S FUNERAL
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT COURFEYRAC WAS SPEAKING CHINESE
HE WENT OUT SOME TIME AFTER THEM
HE PUT IN HIS POCKET THE PISTOLS WHICH
JAVERT HAD GIVEN HIM AT THE TIME OF THE ADVENTURE ON THE 3D OF FEBRUARY
AND WHICH HAD REMAINED IN HIS HANDS
THESE PISTOLS WERE STILL LOADED
IT
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT VAGUE THOUGHT HE HAD IN HIS MIND WHEN HE
TOOK THEM WITH HIM
ALL DAY LONG HE PROWLED ABOUT WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS GOING IT
RAINED AT TIMES HE DID NOT PERCEIVE IT FOR HIS DINNER HE PURCHASED A
PENNY ROLL AT A BAKER'S PUT IT IN HIS POCKET AND FORGOT IT
IT APPEARS
THAT HE TOOK A BATH IN THE SEINE WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF IT
THERE ARE
MOMENTS WHEN A MAN HAS A FURNACE WITHIN HIS SKULL
MARIUS WAS PASSING
THROUGH ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS
HE NO LONGER HOPED FOR ANYTHING THIS
STEP HE HAD TAKEN SINCE THE PRECEDING EVENING
HE WAITED FOR NIGHT WITH
FEVERISH IMPATIENCE HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA CLEARLY BEFORE HIS MIND THIS
WAS THAT AT NINE O'CLOCK HE SHOULD SEE COSETTE
THIS LAST HAPPINESS
NOW CONSTITUTED HIS WHOLE FUTURE AFTER THAT GLOOM
AT INTERVALS AS
HE ROAMED THROUGH THE MOST DESERTED BOULEVARDS IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE
HEARD STRANGE NOISES IN PARIS
HE THRUST HIS HEAD OUT OF HIS REVERY AND
SAID IS THERE FIGHTING ON HAND
AT NIGHTFALL AT NINE O'CLOCK PRECISELY AS HE HAD PROMISED COSETTE
HE WAS IN THE RUE PLUMET
WHEN HE APPROACHED THE GRATING HE FORGOT
EVERYTHING
IT WAS FORTY EIGHT HOURS SINCE HE HAD SEEN COSETTE HE WAS
ABOUT TO BEHOLD HER ONCE MORE EVERY OTHER THOUGHT WAS EFFACED AND
HE FELT ONLY A PROFOUND AND UNHEARD OF JOY
THOSE MINUTES IN WHICH ONE
LIVES CENTURIES ALWAYS HAVE THIS SOVEREIGN AND WONDERFUL PROPERTY THAT
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY ARE PASSING THEY FILL THE HEART COMPLETELY
MARIUS DISPLACED THE BAR AND RUSHED HEADLONG INTO THE GARDEN
COSETTE
WAS NOT AT THE SPOT WHERE SHE ORDINARILY WAITED FOR HIM
HE TRAVERSED
THE THICKET AND APPROACHED THE RECESS NEAR THE FLIGHT OF STEPS SHE
IS WAITING FOR ME THERE SAID HE
COSETTE WAS NOT THERE
HE RAISED HIS
EYES AND SAW THAT THE SHUTTERS OF THE HOUSE WERE CLOSED
HE MADE THE
TOUR OF THE GARDEN THE GARDEN WAS DESERTED
THEN HE RETURNED TO
THE HOUSE AND RENDERED SENSELESS BY LOVE INTOXICATED TERRIFIED
EXASPERATED WITH GRIEF AND UNEASINESS LIKE A MASTER WHO RETURNS HOME AT
AN EVIL HOUR HE TAPPED ON THE SHUTTERS
HE KNOCKED AND KNOCKED AGAIN
AT THE RISK OF SEEING THE WINDOW OPEN AND HER FATHER'S GLOOMY FACE
MAKE ITS APPEARANCE AND DEMAND WHAT DO YOU WANT THIS WAS NOTHING IN
COMPARISON WITH WHAT HE DIMLY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF
WHEN HE HAD RAPPED
HE LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND CALLED COSETTE COSETTE HE CRIED
COSETTE HE REPEATED IMPERIOUSLY
THERE WAS NO REPLY
ALL WAS OVER
NO
ONE IN THE GARDEN NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
MARIUS FIXED HIS DESPAIRING EYES ON THAT DISMAL HOUSE WHICH WAS AS
BLACK AND AS SILENT AS A TOMB AND FAR MORE EMPTY
HE GAZED AT THE STONE
SEAT ON WHICH HE HAD PASSED SO MANY ADORABLE HOURS WITH COSETTE
THEN HE
SEATED HIMSELF ON THE FLIGHT OF STEPS HIS HEART FILLED WITH SWEETNESS
AND RESOLUTION HE BLESSED HIS LOVE IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS THOUGHT AND
HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT SINCE COSETTE WAS GONE ALL THAT THERE WAS LEFT
FOR HIM WAS TO DIE
ALL AT ONCE HE HEARD A VOICE WHICH SEEMED TO PROCEED FROM THE STREET
AND WHICH WAS CALLING TO HIM THROUGH THE TREES
MR
MARIUS
HE STARTED TO HIS FEET
HEY SAID HE
MR
MARIUS ARE YOU THERE
YES
MR
MARIUS WENT ON THE VOICE YOUR FRIENDS ARE WAITING FOR YOU AT
THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE
THIS VOICE WAS NOT WHOLLY UNFAMILIAR TO HIM
IT RESEMBLED THE HOARSE
ROUGH VOICE OF EPONINE
MARIUS HASTENED TO THE GATE THRUST ASIDE THE
MOVABLE BAR PASSED HIS HEAD THROUGH THE APERTURE AND SAW SOME ONE WHO
APPEARED TO HIM TO BE A YOUNG MAN DISAPPEARING AT A RUN INTO THE GLOOM
CHAPTER III M
MABEUF
JEAN VALJEAN'S PURSE WAS OF NO USE TO M
MABEUF
M
MABEUF IN HIS
VENERABLE INFANTILE AUSTERITY HAD NOT ACCEPTED THE GIFT OF THE STARS
HE HAD NOT ADMITTED THAT A STAR COULD COIN ITSELF INTO LOUIS D'OR
HE
HAD NOT DIVINED THAT WHAT HAD FALLEN FROM HEAVEN HAD COME FROM GAVROCHE
HE HAD TAKEN THE PURSE TO THE POLICE COMMISSIONER OF THE QUARTER AS
A LOST ARTICLE PLACED BY THE FINDER AT THE DISPOSAL OF CLAIMANTS
THE
PURSE WAS ACTUALLY LOST
IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT NO ONE CLAIMED
IT AND THAT IT DID NOT SUCCOR M
MABEUF
MOREOVER M
MABEUF HAD CONTINUED HIS DOWNWARD COURSE
HIS EXPERIMENTS ON INDIGO HAD BEEN NO MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE JARDIN DES
PLANTES THAN IN HIS GARDEN AT AUSTERLITZ
THE YEAR BEFORE HE HAD OWED
HIS HOUSEKEEPER'S WAGES NOW AS WE HAVE SEEN HE OWED THREE QUARTERS
OF HIS RENT
THE PAWNSHOP HAD SOLD THE PLATES OF HIS FLORA AFTER THE
EXPIRATION OF THIRTEEN MONTHS
SOME COPPERSMITH HAD MADE STEWPANS OF
THEM
HIS COPPER PLATES GONE AND BEING UNABLE TO COMPLETE EVEN THE
INCOMPLETE COPIES OF HIS FLORA WHICH WERE IN HIS POSSESSION HE HAD
DISPOSED OF THE TEXT AT A MISERABLE PRICE AS WASTE PAPER TO A
SECOND HAND BOOKSELLER
NOTHING NOW REMAINED TO HIM OF HIS LIFE'S WORK
HE SET TO WORK TO EAT UP THE MONEY FOR THESE COPIES
WHEN HE SAW THAT
THIS WRETCHED RESOURCE WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTED HE GAVE UP HIS GARDEN
AND ALLOWED IT TO RUN TO WASTE
BEFORE THIS A LONG TIME BEFORE HE HAD
GIVEN UP HIS TWO EGGS AND THE MORSEL OF BEEF WHICH HE ATE FROM TIME
TO TIME
HE DINED ON BREAD AND POTATOES
HE HAD SOLD THE LAST OF HIS
FURNITURE THEN ALL DUPLICATES OF HIS BEDDING HIS CLOTHING AND HIS
BLANKETS THEN HIS HERBARIUMS AND PRINTS BUT HE STILL RETAINED HIS MOST
PRECIOUS BOOKS MANY OF WHICH WERE OF THE GREATEST RARITY AMONG OTHERS
LES QUADRINS HISTORIQUES DE LA BIBLE EDITION OF 1560 LA CONCORDANCE
DES BIBLES BY PIERRE DE BESSE LES MARGUERITES DE LA MARGUERITE OF
JEAN DE LA HAYE WITH A DEDICATION TO THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE THE BOOK DE
LA CHARGE ET DIGNITE DE L'AMBASSADEUR BY THE SIEUR DE VILLIERS
HOTMAN A FLORILEGIUM RABBINICUM OF 1644 A TIBULLUS OF 1567 WITH THIS
MAGNIFICENT INSCRIPTION VENETIIS IN AEDIBUS MANUTIANIS AND LASTLY A
DIOGENES LAERTIUS PRINTED AT LYONS IN 1644 WHICH CONTAINED THE FAMOUS
VARIANT OF THE MANUSCRIPT 411 THIRTEENTH CENTURY OF THE VATICAN AND
THOSE OF THE TWO MANUSCRIPTS OF VENICE 393 AND 394 CONSULTED WITH
SUCH FRUITFUL RESULTS BY HENRI ESTIENNE AND ALL THE PASSAGES IN DORIC
DIALECT WHICH ARE ONLY FOUND IN THE CELEBRATED MANUSCRIPT OF THE TWELFTH
CENTURY BELONGING TO THE NAPLES LIBRARY
M
MABEUF NEVER HAD ANY FIRE
IN HIS CHAMBER AND WENT TO BED AT SUNDOWN IN ORDER NOT TO CONSUME
ANY CANDLES
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE HAD NO LONGER ANY NEIGHBORS PEOPLE
AVOIDED HIM WHEN HE WENT OUT HE PERCEIVED THE FACT
THE WRETCHEDNESS OF
A CHILD INTERESTS A MOTHER THE WRETCHEDNESS OF A YOUNG MAN INTERESTS A
YOUNG GIRL THE WRETCHEDNESS OF AN OLD MAN INTERESTS NO ONE
IT IS OF
ALL DISTRESSES THE COLDEST
STILL FATHER MABEUF HAD NOT ENTIRELY LOST
HIS CHILDLIKE SERENITY
HIS EYES ACQUIRED SOME VIVACITY WHEN THEY RESTED
ON HIS BOOKS AND HE SMILED WHEN HE GAZED AT THE DIOGENES LAERTIUS
WHICH WAS A UNIQUE COPY
HIS BOOKCASE WITH GLASS DOORS WAS THE
ONLY PIECE OF FURNITURE WHICH HE HAD KEPT BEYOND WHAT WAS STRICTLY
INDISPENSABLE
ONE DAY MOTHER PLUTARQUE SAID TO HIM
I HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY ANY DINNER
WHAT SHE CALLED DINNER WAS A LOAF OF BREAD AND FOUR OR FIVE POTATOES
ON CREDIT SUGGESTED M
MABEUF
YOU KNOW WELL THAT PEOPLE REFUSE ME
M
MABEUF OPENED HIS BOOKCASE TOOK A LONG LOOK AT ALL HIS BOOKS ONE
AFTER ANOTHER AS A FATHER OBLIGED TO DECIMATE HIS CHILDREN WOULD GAZE
UPON THEM BEFORE MAKING A CHOICE THEN SEIZED ONE HASTILY PUT IT
IN UNDER HIS ARM AND WENT OUT
HE RETURNED TWO HOURS LATER WITHOUT
ANYTHING UNDER HIS ARM LAID THIRTY SOUS ON THE TABLE AND SAID
YOU WILL GET SOMETHING FOR DINNER
FROM THAT MOMENT FORTH MOTHER PLUTARQUE SAW A SOMBRE VEIL WHICH WAS
NEVER MORE LIFTED DESCEND OVER THE OLD MAN'S CANDID FACE
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY ON THE DAY AFTER AND ON THE DAY AFTER THAT IT
HAD TO BE DONE AGAIN
M
MABEUF WENT OUT WITH A BOOK AND RETURNED WITH A COIN
AS THE
SECOND HAND DEALERS PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS FORCED TO SELL THEY PURCHASED
OF HIM FOR TWENTY SOUS THAT FOR WHICH HE HAD PAID TWENTY FRANCS
SOMETIMES AT THOSE VERY SHOPS
VOLUME BY VOLUME THE WHOLE LIBRARY
WENT THE SAME ROAD
HE SAID AT TIMES BUT I AM EIGHTY AS THOUGH HE
CHERISHED SOME SECRET HOPE THAT HE SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE END OF HIS DAYS
BEFORE REACHING THE END OF HIS BOOKS
HIS MELANCHOLY INCREASED
ONCE
HOWEVER HE HAD A PLEASURE
HE HAD GONE OUT WITH A ROBERT ESTIENNE
WHICH HE HAD SOLD FOR THIRTY FIVE SOUS UNDER THE QUAI MALAQUAIS AND HE
RETURNED WITH AN ALDUS WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT FOR FORTY SOUS IN THE RUE DES
GRES I OWE FIVE SOUS HE SAID BEAMING ON MOTHER PLUTARQUE
THAT DAY
HE HAD NO DINNER
HE BELONGED TO THE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY
HIS DESTITUTION BECAME KNOWN
THERE
THE PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY CAME TO SEE HIM PROMISED TO
SPEAK TO THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE ABOUT HIM AND DID
SO WHY WHAT EXCLAIMED THE MINISTER I SHOULD THINK SO AN OLD
SAVANT A BOTANIST AN INOFFENSIVE MAN SOMETHING MUST BE DONE FOR HIM
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY M
MABEUF RECEIVED AN INVITATION TO DINE WITH THE
MINISTER
TREMBLING WITH JOY HE SHOWED THE LETTER TO MOTHER PLUTARQUE
WE ARE SAVED SAID HE
ON THE DAY APPOINTED HE WENT TO THE MINISTER'S
HOUSE
HE PERCEIVED THAT HIS RAGGED CRAVAT HIS LONG SQUARE COAT AND
HIS WAXED SHOES ASTONISHED THE USHERS
NO ONE SPOKE TO HIM NOT EVEN THE
MINISTER
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING WHILE HE WAS STILL WAITING
FOR A WORD HE HEARD THE MINISTER'S WIFE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN A
LOW NECKED GOWN WHOM HE HAD NOT VENTURED TO APPROACH INQUIRE WHO IS
THAT OLD GENTLEMAN HE RETURNED HOME ON FOOT AT MIDNIGHT IN A DRIVING
RAIN STORM
HE HAD SOLD AN ELZEVIR TO PAY FOR A CARRIAGE IN WHICH TO GO
THITHER
HE HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF READING A FEW PAGES IN HIS DIOGENES
LAERTIUS EVERY NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
HE KNEW ENOUGH GREEK TO
ENJOY THE PECULIARITIES OF THE TEXT WHICH HE OWNED
HE HAD NOW NO OTHER
ENJOYMENT
SEVERAL WEEKS PASSED
ALL AT ONCE MOTHER PLUTARQUE FELL ILL
THERE IS ONE THING SADDER THAN HAVING NO MONEY WITH WHICH TO BUY BREAD
AT THE BAKER'S AND THAT IS HAVING NO MONEY TO PURCHASE DRUGS AT THE
APOTHECARY'S
ONE EVENING THE DOCTOR HAD ORDERED A VERY EXPENSIVE
POTION
AND THE MALADY WAS GROWING WORSE A NURSE WAS REQUIRED
M
MABEUF OPENED HIS BOOKCASE THERE WAS NOTHING THERE
THE LAST VOLUME HAD
TAKEN ITS DEPARTURE
ALL THAT WAS LEFT TO HIM WAS DIOGENES LAERTIUS
HE PUT THIS UNIQUE COPY UNDER HIS ARM AND WENT OUT
IT WAS THE 4TH OF
JUNE 1832 HE WENT TO THE PORTE SAINT JACQUES TO ROYAL'S SUCCESSOR
AND RETURNED WITH ONE HUNDRED FRANCS
HE LAID THE PILE OF FIVE FRANC
PIECES ON THE OLD SERVING WOMAN'S NIGHTSTAND AND RETURNED TO HIS
CHAMBER WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT DAWN HE SEATED HIMSELF ON THE OVERTURNED
POST IN HIS GARDEN AND HE COULD BE SEEN OVER THE TOP OF THE HEDGE
SITTING THE WHOLE MORNING MOTIONLESS WITH DROOPING HEAD HIS EYES
VAGUELY FIXED ON THE WITHERED FLOWER BEDS
IT RAINED AT INTERVALS THE
OLD MAN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE THE FACT
IN THE AFTERNOON EXTRAORDINARY NOISES BROKE OUT IN PARIS
THEY
RESEMBLED SHOTS AND THE CLAMORS OF A MULTITUDE
FATHER MABEUF RAISED HIS HEAD
HE SAW A GARDENER PASSING AND
INQUIRED
WHAT IS IT
THE GARDENER SPADE ON BACK REPLIED IN THE MOST UNCONCERNED TONE
IT IS THE RIOTS
WHAT RIOTS
YES THEY ARE FIGHTING
WHY ARE THEY FIGHTING
AH GOOD HEAVENS EJACULATED THE GARDENER
IN WHAT DIRECTION WENT ON M
MABEUF
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE ARSENAL
FATHER MABEUF WENT TO HIS ROOM TOOK HIS HAT MECHANICALLY SOUGHT FOR A
BOOK TO PLACE UNDER HIS ARM FOUND NONE SAID AH TRULY AND WENT OFF
WITH A BEWILDERED AIR
BOOK TENTH THE 5TH OF JUNE 1832
CHAPTER I THE SURFACE OF THE QUESTION
OF WHAT IS REVOLT COMPOSED OF NOTHING AND OF EVERYTHING
OF AN
ELECTRICITY DISENGAGED LITTLE BY LITTLE OF A FLAME SUDDENLY DARTING
FORTH OF A WANDERING FORCE OF A PASSING BREATH
THIS BREATH ENCOUNTERS
HEADS WHICH SPEAK BRAINS WHICH DREAM SOULS WHICH SUFFER PASSIONS
WHICH BURN WRETCHEDNESS WHICH HOWLS AND BEARS THEM AWAY
WHITHER
AT RANDOM
ATHWART THE STATE THE LAWS ATHWART PROSPERITY AND THE
INSOLENCE OF OTHERS
IRRITATED CONVICTIONS EMBITTERED ENTHUSIASMS AGITATED INDIGNATIONS
INSTINCTS OF WAR WHICH HAVE BEEN REPRESSED YOUTHFUL COURAGE WHICH HAS
BEEN EXALTED GENEROUS BLINDNESS CURIOSITY THE TASTE FOR CHANGE
THE THIRST FOR THE UNEXPECTED THE SENTIMENT WHICH CAUSES ONE TO
TAKE PLEASURE IN READING THE POSTERS FOR THE NEW PLAY AND LOVE
THE PROMPTER'S WHISTLE AT THE THEATRE THE VAGUE HATREDS RANCORS
DISAPPOINTMENTS EVERY VANITY WHICH THINKS THAT DESTINY HAS BANKRUPTED
IT DISCOMFORT EMPTY DREAMS AMBITIOUS THAT ARE HEDGED ABOUT WHOEVER
HOPES FOR A DOWNFALL SOME OUTCOME IN SHORT AT THE VERY BOTTOM THE
RABBLE THAT MUD WHICH CATCHES FIRE SUCH ARE THE ELEMENTS OF REVOLT
THAT WHICH IS GRANDEST AND THAT WHICH IS BASEST THE BEINGS WHO PROWL
OUTSIDE OF ALL BOUNDS AWAITING AN OCCASION BOHEMIANS VAGRANTS
VAGABONDS OF THE CROSS ROADS THOSE WHO SLEEP AT NIGHT IN A DESERT OF
HOUSES WITH NO OTHER ROOF THAN THE COLD CLOUDS OF HEAVEN THOSE WHO
EACH DAY DEMAND THEIR BREAD FROM CHANCE AND NOT FROM TOIL THE UNKNOWN
OF POVERTY AND NOTHINGNESS THE BARE ARMED THE BARE FOOTED BELONG TO
REVOLT
WHOEVER CHERISHES IN HIS SOUL A SECRET REVOLT AGAINST ANY DEED
WHATEVER ON THE PART OF THE STATE OF LIFE OR OF FATE IS RIPE FOR RIOT
AND AS SOON AS IT MAKES ITS APPEARANCE HE BEGINS TO QUIVER AND TO
FEEL HIMSELF BORNE AWAY WITH THE WHIRLWIND
REVOLT IS A SORT OF WATERSPOUT IN THE SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE WHICH FORMS
SUDDENLY IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF TEMPERATURE AND WHICH AS IT EDDIES
ABOUT MOUNTS DESCENDS THUNDERS TEARS RAZES CRUSHES DEMOLISHES
UPROOTS BEARING WITH IT GREAT NATURES AND SMALL THE STRONG MAN AND THE
FEEBLE MIND THE TREE TRUNK AND THE STALK OF STRAW
WOE TO HIM WHOM IT
BEARS AWAY AS WELL AS TO HIM WHOM IT STRIKES IT BREAKS THE ONE AGAINST
THE OTHER
IT COMMUNICATES TO THOSE WHOM IT SEIZES AN INDESCRIBABLE AND
EXTRAORDINARY POWER
IT FILLS THE FIRST COMER WITH THE FORCE OF EVENTS
IT CONVERTS EVERYTHING INTO PROJECTILES
IT MAKES A CANNON BALL OF A
ROUGH STONE AND A GENERAL OF A PORTER
IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE CERTAIN ORACLES OF CRAFTY POLITICAL VIEWS A LITTLE
REVOLT IS DESIRABLE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF POWER
SYSTEM REVOLT
STRENGTHENS THOSE GOVERNMENTS WHICH IT DOES NOT OVERTHROW
IT PUTS
THE ARMY TO THE TEST IT CONSECRATES THE BOURGEOISIE IT DRAWS OUT
THE MUSCLES OF THE POLICE IT DEMONSTRATES THE FORCE OF THE SOCIAL
FRAMEWORK
IT IS AN EXERCISE IN GYMNASTICS IT IS ALMOST HYGIENE
POWER
IS IN BETTER HEALTH AFTER A REVOLT AS A MAN IS AFTER A GOOD RUBBING
DOWN
REVOLT THIRTY YEARS AGO WAS REGARDED FROM STILL OTHER POINTS OF VIEW
THERE IS FOR EVERYTHING A THEORY WHICH PROCLAIMS ITSELF GOOD SENSE
PHILINTUS AGAINST ALCESTIS MEDIATION OFFERED BETWEEN THE FALSE AND THE
TRUE EXPLANATION ADMONITION RATHER HAUGHTY EXTENUATION WHICH BECAUSE
IT IS MINGLED WITH BLAME AND EXCUSE THINKS ITSELF WISDOM AND IS OFTEN
ONLY PEDANTRY
A WHOLE POLITICAL SCHOOL CALLED THE GOLDEN MEAN HAS
BEEN THE OUTCOME OF THIS
AS BETWEEN COLD WATER AND HOT WATER IT IS
THE LUKEWARM WATER PARTY
THIS SCHOOL WITH ITS FALSE DEPTH ALL ON THE
SURFACE WHICH DISSECTS EFFECTS WITHOUT GOING BACK TO FIRST CAUSES
CHIDES FROM ITS HEIGHT OF A DEMI SCIENCE THE AGITATION OF THE PUBLIC
SQUARE
IF WE LISTEN TO THIS SCHOOL THE RIOTS WHICH COMPLICATED THE AFFAIR
OF 1830 DEPRIVED THAT GREAT EVENT OF A PORTION OF ITS PURITY
THE
REVOLUTION OF JULY HAD BEEN A FINE POPULAR GALE ABRUPTLY FOLLOWED
BY BLUE SKY
THEY MADE THE CLOUDY SKY REAPPEAR
THEY CAUSED THAT
REVOLUTION AT FIRST SO REMARKABLE FOR ITS UNANIMITY TO DEGENERATE INTO
A QUARREL
IN THE REVOLUTION OF JULY AS IN ALL PROGRESS ACCOMPLISHED BY
FITS AND STARTS THERE HAD BEEN SECRET FRACTURES THESE RIOTS RENDERED
THEM PERCEPTIBLE
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID 'AH THIS IS BROKEN AFTER
THE REVOLUTION OF JULY ONE WAS SENSIBLE ONLY OF DELIVERANCE AFTER THE
RIOTS ONE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A CATASTROPHE
ALL REVOLT CLOSES THE SHOPS DEPRESSES THE FUNDS THROWS THE EXCHANGE
INTO CONSTERNATION SUSPENDS COMMERCE CLOGS BUSINESS PRECIPITATES
FAILURES NO MORE MONEY PRIVATE FORTUNES RENDERED UNEASY PUBLIC CREDIT
SHAKEN INDUSTRY DISCONCERTED CAPITAL WITHDRAWING WORK AT A DISCOUNT
FEAR EVERYWHERE COUNTER SHOCKS IN EVERY TOWN
HENCE GULFS
IT HAS BEEN
CALCULATED THAT THE FIRST DAY OF A RIOT COSTS FRANCE TWENTY MILLIONS
THE SECOND DAY FORTY THE THIRD SIXTY A THREE DAYS' UPRISING COSTS
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLIONS THAT IS TO SAY IF ONLY THE FINANCIAL
RESULT BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IT IS EQUIVALENT TO A DISASTER A
SHIPWRECK OR A LOST BATTLE WHICH SHOULD ANNIHILATE A FLEET OF SIXTY
SHIPS OF THE LINE
NO DOUBT HISTORICALLY UPRISINGS HAVE THEIR BEAUTY THE WAR OF THE
PAVEMENTS IS NO LESS GRANDIOSE AND NO LESS PATHETIC THAN THE WAR OF
THICKETS IN THE ONE THERE IS THE SOUL OF FORESTS IN THE OTHER THE
HEART OF CITIES THE ONE HAS JEAN CHOUAN THE OTHER HAS A JEANNE
REVOLTS HAVE ILLUMINATED WITH A RED GLARE ALL THE MOST ORIGINAL POINTS
OF THE PARISIAN CHARACTER GENEROSITY DEVOTION STORMY GAYETY STUDENTS
PROVING THAT BRAVERY FORMS PART OF INTELLIGENCE THE NATIONAL GUARD
INVINCIBLE BIVOUACS OF SHOPKEEPERS FORTRESSES OF STREET URCHINS
CONTEMPT OF DEATH ON THE PART OF PASSERS BY
SCHOOLS AND LEGIONS CLASHED
TOGETHER
AFTER ALL BETWEEN THE COMBATANTS THERE WAS ONLY A DIFFERENCE
OF AGE THE RACE IS THE SAME IT IS THE SAME STOICAL MEN WHO DIED AT THE
AGE OF TWENTY FOR THEIR IDEAS AT FORTY FOR THEIR FAMILIES
THE
ARMY ALWAYS A SAD THING IN CIVIL WARS OPPOSED PRUDENCE TO AUDACITY
UPRISINGS WHILE PROVING POPULAR INTREPIDITY ALSO EDUCATED THE COURAGE
OF THE BOURGEOIS
THIS IS WELL
BUT IS ALL THIS WORTH THE BLOODSHED AND TO THE BLOODSHED
ADD THE FUTURE DARKNESS PROGRESS COMPROMISED UNEASINESS AMONG THE
BEST MEN HONEST LIBERALS IN DESPAIR FOREIGN ABSOLUTISM HAPPY IN THESE
WOUNDS DEALT TO REVOLUTION BY ITS OWN HAND THE VANQUISHED OF 1830
TRIUMPHING AND SAYING 'WE TOLD YOU SO ADD PARIS ENLARGED POSSIBLY
BUT FRANCE MOST ASSUREDLY DIMINISHED
ADD FOR ALL MUST NEEDS BE TOLD
THE MASSACRES WHICH HAVE TOO OFTEN DISHONORED THE VICTORY OF ORDER GROWN
FEROCIOUS OVER LIBERTY GONE MAD
TO SUM UP ALL UPRISINGS HAVE BEEN
DISASTROUS
THUS SPEAKS THAT APPROXIMATION TO WISDOM WITH WHICH THE BOURGEOISIE
THAT APPROXIMATION TO THE PEOPLE SO WILLINGLY CONTENTS ITSELF
FOR OUR PARTS WE REJECT THIS WORD UPRISINGS AS TOO LARGE AND
CONSEQUENTLY AS TOO CONVENIENT
WE MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN ONE
POPULAR MOVEMENT AND ANOTHER POPULAR MOVEMENT
WE DO NOT INQUIRE WHETHER
AN UPRISING COSTS AS MUCH AS A BATTLE
WHY A BATTLE IN THE FIRST PLACE
HERE THE QUESTION OF WAR COMES UP
IS WAR LESS OF A SCOURGE THAN AN
UPRISING IS OF A CALAMITY AND THEN ARE ALL UPRISINGS CALAMITIES AND
WHAT IF THE REVOLT OF JULY DID COST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLIONS THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF PHILIP V
IN SPAIN COST FRANCE TWO MILLIARDS
EVEN AT
THE SAME PRICE WE SHOULD PREFER THE 14TH OF JULY
HOWEVER WE REJECT
THESE FIGURES WHICH APPEAR TO BE REASONS AND WHICH ARE ONLY WORDS
AN
UPRISING BEING GIVEN WE EXAMINE IT BY ITSELF
IN ALL THAT IS SAID BY
THE DOCTRINARIAN OBJECTION ABOVE PRESENTED THERE IS NO QUESTION OF
ANYTHING BUT EFFECT WE SEEK THE CAUSE
WE WILL BE EXPLICIT
CHAPTER II THE ROOT OF THE MATTER
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS AN UPRISING AND THERE IS SUCH A THING AS
INSURRECTION THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE PHASES OF WRATH ONE IS IN THE
WRONG THE OTHER IS IN THE RIGHT
IN DEMOCRATIC STATES THE ONLY ONES
WHICH ARE FOUNDED ON JUSTICE IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT THE FRACTION
USURPS THEN THE WHOLE RISES AND THE NECESSARY CLAIM OF ITS RIGHTS MAY
PROCEED AS FAR AS RESORT TO ARMS
IN ALL QUESTIONS WHICH RESULT FROM
COLLECTIVE SOVEREIGNTY THE WAR OF THE WHOLE AGAINST THE FRACTION IS
INSURRECTION THE ATTACK OF THE FRACTION AGAINST THE WHOLE IS REVOLT
ACCORDING AS THE TUILERIES CONTAIN A KING OR THE CONVENTION THEY
ARE JUSTLY OR UNJUSTLY ATTACKED
THE SAME CANNON POINTED AGAINST THE
POPULACE IS WRONG ON THE 10TH OF AUGUST AND RIGHT ON THE 14TH OF
VENDEMIAIRE
ALIKE IN APPEARANCE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT IN REALITY
THE SWISS DEFEND THE FALSE BONAPARTE DEFENDS THE TRUE
THAT WHICH
UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE HAS EFFECTED IN ITS LIBERTY AND IN ITS SOVEREIGNTY
CANNOT BE UNDONE BY THE STREET
IT IS THE SAME IN THINGS PERTAINING
PURELY TO CIVILIZATION THE INSTINCT OF THE MASSES CLEAR SIGHTED
TO DAY MAY BE TROUBLED TO MORROW
THE SAME FURY LEGITIMATE WHEN
DIRECTED AGAINST TERRAY AND ABSURD WHEN DIRECTED AGAINST TURGOT
THE
DESTRUCTION OF MACHINES THE PILLAGE OF WAREHOUSES THE BREAKING OF
RAILS THE DEMOLITION OF DOCKS THE FALSE ROUTES OF MULTITUDES THE
REFUSAL BY THE PEOPLE OF JUSTICE TO PROGRESS RAMUS ASSASSINATED BY
STUDENTS ROUSSEAU DRIVEN OUT OF SWITZERLAND AND STONED THAT IS
REVOLT
ISRAEL AGAINST MOSES ATHENS AGAINST PHOCIAN ROME AGAINST
CICERO THAT IS AN UPRISING PARIS AGAINST THE BASTILLE THAT IS
INSURRECTION
THE SOLDIERS AGAINST ALEXANDER THE SAILORS AGAINST
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS THIS IS THE SAME REVOLT IMPIOUS REVOLT
WHY BECAUSE ALEXANDER IS DOING FOR ASIA WITH THE SWORD THAT WHICH
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IS DOING FOR AMERICA WITH THE COMPASS ALEXANDER
LIKE COLUMBUS IS FINDING A WORLD
THESE GIFTS OF A WORLD TO
CIVILIZATION ARE SUCH AUGMENTATIONS OF LIGHT THAT ALL RESISTANCE IN
THAT CASE IS CULPABLE
SOMETIMES THE POPULACE COUNTERFEITS FIDELITY TO
ITSELF
THE MASSES ARE TRAITORS TO THE PEOPLE
IS THERE FOR EXAMPLE
ANYTHING STRANGER THAN THAT LONG AND BLOODY PROTEST OF DEALERS IN
CONTRABAND SALT A LEGITIMATE CHRONIC REVOLT WHICH AT THE DECISIVE
MOMENT ON THE DAY OF SALVATION AT THE VERY HOUR OF POPULAR VICTORY
ESPOUSES THE THRONE TURNS INTO CHOUANNERIE AND FROM HAVING BEEN AN
INSURRECTION AGAINST BECOMES AN UPRISING FOR SOMBRE MASTERPIECES OF
IGNORANCE THE CONTRABAND SALT DEALER ESCAPES THE ROYAL GIBBETS AND
WITH A ROPE'S END ROUND HIS NECK MOUNTS THE WHITE COCKADE
DEATH TO
THE SALT DUTIES BRINGS FORTH LONG LIVE THE KING THE ASSASSINS OF
SAINT BARTHELEMY THE CUT THROATS OF SEPTEMBER THE MANSLAUGHTERERS OF
AVIGNON THE ASSASSINS OF COLIGNY THE ASSASSINS OF MADAM LAMBALLE THE
ASSASSINS OF BRUNE MIQUELETS VERDETS CADENETTES THE COMPANIONS OF
JEHU THE CHEVALIERS OF BRASSARD BEHOLD AN UPRISING
LA VENDEE IS
A GRAND CATHOLIC UPRISING
THE SOUND OF RIGHT IN MOVEMENT IS
RECOGNIZABLE IT DOES NOT ALWAYS PROCEED FROM THE TREMBLING OF EXCITED
MASSES THERE ARE MAD RAGES THERE ARE CRACKED BELLS ALL TOCSINS DO NOT
GIVE OUT THE SOUND OF BRONZE
THE BRAWL OF PASSIONS AND IGNORANCES
IS QUITE ANOTHER THING FROM THE SHOCK OF PROGRESS
SHOW ME IN WHAT
DIRECTION YOU ARE GOING
RISE IF YOU WILL BUT LET IT BE THAT YOU MAY
GROW GREAT
THERE IS NO INSURRECTION EXCEPT IN A FORWARD DIRECTION
ANY
OTHER SORT OF RISING IS BAD EVERY VIOLENT STEP TOWARDS THE REAR IS A
REVOLT TO RETREAT IS TO COMMIT A DEED OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE HUMAN
RACE
INSURRECTION IS A FIT OF RAGE ON THE PART OF TRUTH THE PAVEMENTS
WHICH THE UPRISING DISTURBS GIVE FORTH THE SPARK OF RIGHT
THESE
PAVEMENTS BEQUEATH TO THE UPRISING ONLY THEIR MUD
DANTON AGAINST LOUIS
XIV
IS INSURRECTION HEBERT AGAINST DANTON IS REVOLT
HENCE IT RESULTS THAT IF INSURRECTION IN GIVEN CASES MAY BE AS
LAFAYETTE SAYS THE MOST HOLY OF DUTIES AN UPRISING MAY BE THE MOST
FATAL OF CRIMES
THERE IS ALSO A DIFFERENCE IN THE INTENSITY OF HEAT INSURRECTION IS
OFTEN A VOLCANO REVOLT IS OFTEN ONLY A FIRE OF STRAW
REVOLT AS WE HAVE SAID IS SOMETIMES FOUND AMONG THOSE IN POWER
POLIGNAC IS A RIOTER CAMILLE DESMOULINS IS ONE OF THE GOVERNING POWERS
INSURRECTION IS SOMETIMES RESURRECTION
THE SOLUTION OF EVERYTHING BY UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE BEING AN ABSOLUTELY
MODERN FACT AND ALL HISTORY ANTERIOR TO THIS FACT BEING FOR THE SPACE
OF FOUR THOUSAND YEARS FILLED WITH VIOLATED RIGHT AND THE SUFFERING OF
PEOPLES EACH EPOCH OF HISTORY BRINGS WITH IT THAT PROTEST OF WHICH IT
IS CAPABLE
UNDER THE CAESARS THERE WAS NO INSURRECTION BUT THERE WAS
JUVENAL
THE FACIT INDIGNATIO REPLACES THE GRACCHI
UNDER THE CAESARS THERE IS THE EXILE TO SYENE THERE IS ALSO THE MAN OF
THE ANNALES
WE DO NOT SPEAK OF THE IMMENSE EXILE OF PATMOS WHO ON HIS
PART ALSO OVERWHELMS THE REAL WORLD WITH A PROTEST IN THE NAME OF THE
IDEAL WORLD WHO MAKES OF HIS VISION AN ENORMOUS SATIRE AND CASTS ON
ROME NINEVEH ON ROME BABYLON ON ROME SODOM THE FLAMING REFLECTION OF
THE APOCALYPSE
JOHN ON HIS ROCK IS THE SPHINX ON ITS PEDESTAL WE MAY
UNDERSTAND HIM HE IS A JEW AND IT IS HEBREW BUT THE MAN WHO WRITES
THE ANNALES IS OF THE LATIN RACE LET US RATHER SAY HE IS A ROMAN
AS THE NEROS REIGN IN A BLACK WAY THEY SHOULD BE PAINTED TO MATCH
THE
WORK OF THE GRAVING TOOL ALONE WOULD BE TOO PALE THERE MUST BE POURED
INTO THE CHANNEL A CONCENTRATED PROSE WHICH BITES
DESPOTS COUNT FOR SOMETHING IN THE QUESTION OF PHILOSOPHERS
A WORD THAT
IS CHAINED IS A TERRIBLE WORD
THE WRITER DOUBLES AND TREBLES HIS STYLE
WHEN SILENCE IS IMPOSED ON A NATION BY ITS MASTER
FROM THIS SILENCE
THERE ARISES A CERTAIN MYSTERIOUS PLENITUDE WHICH FILTERS INTO THOUGHT
AND THERE CONGEALS INTO BRONZE
THE COMPRESSION OF HISTORY PRODUCES
CONCISENESS IN THE HISTORIAN
THE GRANITE SOLIDITY OF SUCH AND SUCH A
CELEBRATED PROSE IS NOTHING BUT THE ACCUMULATION EFFECTED BY THE TYRANT
TYRANNY CONSTRAINS THE WRITER TO CONDITIONS OF DIAMETER WHICH ARE
AUGMENTATIONS OF FORCE
THE CICERONIAN PERIOD WHICH HARDLY SUFFICED
FOR VERRES WOULD BE BLUNTED ON CALIGULA
THE LESS SPREAD OF SAIL IN
THE PHRASE THE MORE INTENSITY IN THE BLOW
TACITUS THINKS WITH ALL HIS
MIGHT
THE HONESTY OF A GREAT HEART CONDENSED IN JUSTICE AND TRUTH OVERWHELMS
AS WITH LIGHTNING
BE IT REMARKED IN PASSING THAT TACITUS IS NOT HISTORICALLY SUPERPOSED
UPON CAESAR
THE TIBERII WERE RESERVED FOR HIM
CAESAR AND TACITUS
ARE TWO SUCCESSIVE PHENOMENA A MEETING BETWEEN WHOM SEEMS TO BE
MYSTERIOUSLY AVOIDED BY THE ONE WHO WHEN HE SETS THE CENTURIES ON THE
STAGE REGULATES THE ENTRANCES AND THE EXITS
CAESAR IS GREAT TACITUS
IS GREAT GOD SPARES THESE TWO GREATNESSES BY NOT ALLOWING THEM TO CLASH
WITH ONE ANOTHER
THE GUARDIAN OF JUSTICE IN STRIKING CAESAR MIGHT
STRIKE TOO HARD AND BE UNJUST
GOD DOES NOT WILL IT
THE GREAT WARS
OF AFRICA AND SPAIN THE PIRATES OF SICILY DESTROYED CIVILIZATION
INTRODUCED INTO GAUL INTO BRITANNY INTO GERMANY ALL THIS GLORY
COVERS THE RUBICON
THERE IS HERE A SORT OF DELICACY OF THE DIVINE
JUSTICE HESITATING TO LET LOOSE UPON THE ILLUSTRIOUS USURPER THE
FORMIDABLE HISTORIAN SPARING CAESAR TACITUS AND ACCORDING EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES TO GENIUS
CERTAINLY DESPOTISM REMAINS DESPOTISM EVEN UNDER THE DESPOT OF GENIUS
THERE IS CORRUPTION UNDER ALL ILLUSTRIOUS TYRANTS BUT THE MORAL PEST IS
STILL MORE HIDEOUS UNDER INFAMOUS TYRANTS
IN SUCH REIGNS NOTHING VEILS
THE SHAME AND THOSE WHO MAKE EXAMPLES TACITUS AS WELL AS JUVENAL
SLAP THIS IGNOMINY WHICH CANNOT REPLY IN THE FACE MORE USEFULLY IN THE
PRESENCE OF ALL HUMANITY
ROME SMELLS WORSE UNDER VITELLIUS THAN UNDER SYLLA
UNDER CLAUDIUS AND
UNDER DOMITIAN THERE IS A DEFORMITY OF BASENESS CORRESPONDING TO THE
REPULSIVENESS OF THE TYRANT
THE VILLAINY OF SLAVES IS A DIRECT PRODUCT
OF THE DESPOT A MIASMA EXHALES FROM THESE COWERING CONSCIENCES WHEREIN
THE MASTER IS REFLECTED PUBLIC POWERS ARE UNCLEAN HEARTS ARE SMALL
CONSCIENCES ARE DULL SOULS ARE LIKE VERMIN THUS IT IS UNDER CARACALLA
THUS IT IS UNDER COMMODUS THUS IT IS UNDER HELIOGABALUS WHILE FROM
THE ROMAN SENATE UNDER CAESAR THERE COMES NOTHING BUT THE ODOR OF THE
DUNG WHICH IS PECULIAR TO THE EYRIES OF THE EAGLES
HENCE THE ADVENT APPARENTLY TARDY OF THE TACITUSES AND THE JUVENALS
IT IS IN THE HOUR FOR EVIDENCE THAT THE DEMONSTRATOR MAKES HIS
APPEARANCE
BUT JUVENAL AND TACITUS LIKE ISAIAH IN BIBLICAL TIMES LIKE DANTE IN
THE MIDDLE AGES IS MAN RIOT AND INSURRECTION ARE THE MULTITUDE WHICH
IS SOMETIMES RIGHT AND SOMETIMES WRONG
IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES RIOT PROCEEDS FROM A MATERIAL FACT
INSURRECTION IS ALWAYS A MORAL PHENOMENON
RIOT IS MASANIELLO
INSURRECTION SPARTACUS
INSURRECTION BORDERS ON MIND RIOT ON THE
STOMACH GASTER GROWS IRRITATED BUT GASTER ASSUREDLY IS NOT ALWAYS IN
THE WRONG
IN QUESTIONS OF FAMINE RIOT BUZANCAIS FOR EXAMPLE HOLDS A
TRUE PATHETIC AND JUST POINT OF DEPARTURE
NEVERTHELESS IT REMAINS
A RIOT
WHY IT IS BECAUSE RIGHT AT BOTTOM IT WAS WRONG IN FORM
SHY
ALTHOUGH IN THE RIGHT VIOLENT ALTHOUGH STRONG IT STRUCK AT RANDOM IT
WALKED LIKE A BLIND ELEPHANT IT LEFT BEHIND IT THE CORPSES OF OLD
MEN OF WOMEN AND OF CHILDREN IT WISHED THE BLOOD OF INOFFENSIVE AND
INNOCENT PERSONS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY
THE NOURISHMENT OF THE PEOPLE IS A
GOOD OBJECT TO MASSACRE THEM IS A BAD MEANS
ALL ARMED PROTESTS EVEN THE MOST LEGITIMATE EVEN THAT OF THE 10TH OF
AUGUST EVEN THAT OF JULY 14TH BEGIN WITH THE SAME TROUBLES
BEFORE
THE RIGHT GETS SET FREE THERE IS FOAM AND TUMULT
IN THE BEGINNING THE
INSURRECTION IS A RIOT JUST AS A RIVER IS A TORRENT
ORDINARILY IT ENDS
IN THAT OCEAN REVOLUTION
SOMETIMES HOWEVER COMING FROM THOSE LOFTY
MOUNTAINS WHICH DOMINATE THE MORAL HORIZON JUSTICE WISDOM REASON
RIGHT FORMED OF THE PURE SNOW OF THE IDEAL AFTER A LONG FALL FROM
ROCK TO ROCK AFTER HAVING REFLECTED THE SKY IN ITS TRANSPARENCY AND
INCREASED BY A HUNDRED AFFLUENTS IN THE MAJESTIC MIEN OF TRIUMPH
INSURRECTION IS SUDDENLY LOST IN SOME QUAGMIRE AS THE RHINE IS IN A
SWAMP
ALL THIS IS OF THE PAST THE FUTURE IS ANOTHER THING
UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE
HAS THIS ADMIRABLE PROPERTY THAT IT DISSOLVES RIOT IN ITS INCEPTION
AND BY GIVING THE VOTE TO INSURRECTION IT DEPRIVES IT OF ITS ARMS
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF WARS OF STREET WARS AS WELL AS OF WARS ON THE
FRONTIERS SUCH IS THE INEVITABLE PROGRESSION
WHATEVER TO DAY MAY BE
TO MORROW WILL BE PEACE
HOWEVER INSURRECTION RIOT AND POINTS OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FORMER
AND THE LATTER THE BOURGEOIS PROPERLY SPEAKING KNOWS NOTHING OF SUCH
SHADES
IN HIS MIND ALL IS SEDITION REBELLION PURE AND SIMPLE THE
REVOLT OF THE DOG AGAINST HIS MASTER AN ATTEMPT TO BITE WHOM MUST BE
PUNISHED BY THE CHAIN AND THE KENNEL BARKING SNAPPING UNTIL SUCH DAY
AS THE HEAD OF THE DOG SUDDENLY ENLARGED IS OUTLINED VAGUELY IN THE
GLOOM FACE TO FACE WITH THE LION
THEN THE BOURGEOIS SHOUTS LONG LIVE THE PEOPLE
THIS EXPLANATION GIVEN WHAT DOES THE MOVEMENT OF JUNE 1832 SIGNIFY
SO FAR AS HISTORY IS CONCERNED IS IT A REVOLT IS IT AN INSURRECTION
IT MAY HAPPEN TO US IN PLACING THIS FORMIDABLE EVENT ON THE STAGE TO
SAY REVOLT NOW AND THEN BUT MERELY TO DISTINGUISH SUPERFICIAL FACTS
AND ALWAYS PRESERVING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN REVOLT THE FORM AND
INSURRECTION THE FOUNDATION
THIS MOVEMENT OF 1832 HAD IN ITS RAPID OUTBREAK AND IN ITS MELANCHOLY
EXTINCTION SO MUCH GRANDEUR THAT EVEN THOSE WHO SEE IN IT ONLY AN
UPRISING NEVER REFER TO IT OTHERWISE THAN WITH RESPECT
FOR THEM IT
IS LIKE A RELIC OF 1830
EXCITED IMAGINATIONS SAY THEY ARE NOT TO BE
CALMED IN A DAY
A REVOLUTION CANNOT BE CUT OFF SHORT
IT MUST NEEDS
UNDERGO SOME UNDULATIONS BEFORE IT RETURNS TO A STATE OF REST LIKE A
MOUNTAIN SINKING INTO THE PLAIN
THERE ARE NO ALPS WITHOUT THEIR JURA
NOR PYRENEES WITHOUT THE ASTURIAS
THIS PATHETIC CRISIS OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY WHICH THE MEMORY OF
PARISIANS CALLS THE EPOCH OF THE RIOTS IS CERTAINLY A CHARACTERISTIC
HOUR AMID THE STORMY HOURS OF THIS CENTURY
A LAST WORD BEFORE WE ENTER
ON THE RECITAL
THE FACTS WHICH WE ARE ABOUT TO RELATE BELONG TO THAT DRAMATIC AND
LIVING REALITY WHICH THE HISTORIAN SOMETIMES NEGLECTS FOR LACK OF TIME
AND SPACE
THERE NEVERTHELESS WE INSIST UPON IT IS LIFE PALPITATION
HUMAN TREMOR
PETTY DETAILS AS WE THINK WE HAVE ALREADY SAID ARE SO
TO SPEAK THE FOLIAGE OF GREAT EVENTS AND ARE LOST IN THE DISTANCE OF
HISTORY
THE EPOCH SURNAMED OF THE RIOTS ABOUNDS IN DETAILS OF
THIS NATURE
JUDICIAL INQUIRIES HAVE NOT REVEALED AND PERHAPS HAVE NOT
SOUNDED THE DEPTHS FOR ANOTHER REASON THAN HISTORY
WE SHALL THEREFORE
BRING TO LIGHT AMONG THE KNOWN AND PUBLISHED PECULIARITIES THINGS
WHICH HAVE NOT HERETOFORE BEEN KNOWN ABOUT FACTS OVER WHICH HAVE PASSED
THE FORGETFULNESS OF SOME AND THE DEATH OF OTHERS
THE MAJORITY OF THE
ACTORS IN THESE GIGANTIC SCENES HAVE DISAPPEARED BEGINNING WITH THE
VERY NEXT DAY THEY HELD THEIR PEACE BUT OF WHAT WE SHALL RELATE WE
SHALL BE ABLE TO SAY WE HAVE SEEN THIS WE ALTER A FEW NAMES FOR
HISTORY RELATES AND DOES NOT INFORM AGAINST BUT THE DEED WHICH WE SHALL
PAINT WILL BE GENUINE
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS OF THE BOOK
WHICH WE ARE NOW WRITING WE SHALL SHOW ONLY ONE SIDE AND ONE EPISODE
AND CERTAINLY THE LEAST KNOWN AT THAT OF THE TWO DAYS THE 5TH AND THE
6TH OF JUNE 1832 BUT WE SHALL DO IT IN SUCH WISE THAT THE READER MAY
CATCH A GLIMPSE BENEATH THE GLOOMY VEIL WHICH WE ARE ABOUT TO LIFT OF
THE REAL FORM OF THIS FRIGHTFUL PUBLIC ADVENTURE
CHAPTER III A BURIAL AN OCCASION TO BE BORN AGAIN
IN THE SPRING OF 1832 ALTHOUGH THE CHOLERA HAD BEEN CHILLING ALL
MINDS FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS AND HAD CAST OVER THEIR AGITATION AN
INDESCRIBABLE AND GLOOMY PACIFICATION PARIS HAD ALREADY LONG BEEN RIPE
FOR COMMOTION
AS WE HAVE SAID THE GREAT CITY RESEMBLES A PIECE OF
ARTILLERY WHEN IT IS LOADED IT SUFFICES FOR A SPARK TO FALL AND THE
SHOT IS DISCHARGED
IN JUNE 1832 THE SPARK WAS THE DEATH OF GENERAL
LAMARQUE
LAMARQUE WAS A MAN OF RENOWN AND OF ACTION
HE HAD HAD IN SUCCESSION
UNDER THE EMPIRE AND UNDER THE RESTORATION THE SORTS OF BRAVERY
REQUISITE FOR THE TWO EPOCHS THE BRAVERY OF THE BATTLE FIELD AND THE
BRAVERY OF THE TRIBUNE
HE WAS AS ELOQUENT AS HE HAD BEEN VALIANT A
SWORD WAS DISCERNIBLE IN HIS SPEECH
LIKE FOY HIS PREDECESSOR AFTER
UPHOLDING THE COMMAND HE UPHELD LIBERTY HE SAT BETWEEN THE LEFT AND
THE EXTREME LEFT BELOVED OF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE HE ACCEPTED THE CHANCES
OF THE FUTURE BELOVED OF THE POPULACE BECAUSE HE HAD SERVED THE
EMPEROR WELL HE WAS IN COMPANY WITH COMTES GERARD AND DROUET ONE
OF NAPOLEON'S MARSHALS IN PETTO
THE TREATIES OF 1815 REMOVED HIM AS
A PERSONAL OFFENCE
HE HATED WELLINGTON WITH A DOWNRIGHT HATRED WHICH
PLEASED THE MULTITUDE AND FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS HE MAJESTICALLY
PRESERVED THE SADNESS OF WATERLOO PAYING HARDLY ANY ATTENTION TO
INTERVENING EVENTS
IN HIS DEATH AGONY AT HIS LAST HOUR HE CLASPED TO
HIS BREAST A SWORD WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HIM BY THE OFFICERS OF
THE HUNDRED DAYS
NAPOLEON HAD DIED UTTERING THE WORD ARMY LAMARQUE
UTTERING THE WORD COUNTRY
HIS DEATH WHICH WAS EXPECTED WAS DREADED BY THE PEOPLE AS A LOSS AND
BY THE GOVERNMENT AS AN OCCASION
THIS DEATH WAS AN AFFLICTION
LIKE
EVERYTHING THAT IS BITTER AFFLICTION MAY TURN TO REVOLT
THIS IS WHAT
TOOK PLACE
ON THE PRECEDING EVENING AND ON THE MORNING OF THE 5TH OF JUNE THE DAY
APPOINTED FOR LAMARQUE'S BURIAL THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE WHICH THE
PROCESSION WAS TO TOUCH AT ASSUMED A FORMIDABLE ASPECT
THIS TUMULTUOUS
NETWORK OF STREETS WAS FILLED WITH RUMORS
THEY ARMED THEMSELVES AS BEST
THEY MIGHT
JOINERS CARRIED OFF DOOR WEIGHTS OF THEIR ESTABLISHMENT
TO BREAK DOWN DOORS ONE OF THEM HAD MADE HIMSELF A DAGGER OF A
STOCKING WEAVER'S HOOK BY BREAKING OFF THE HOOK AND SHARPENING THE
STUMP
ANOTHER WHO WAS IN A FEVER TO ATTACK SLEPT WHOLLY DRESSED
FOR THREE DAYS
A CARPENTER NAMED LOMBIER MET A COMRADE WHO ASKED HIM
WHITHER ARE YOU GOING EH WELL I HAVE NO WEAPONS WHAT THEN
I'M GOING TO MY TIMBER YARD TO GET MY COMPASSES WHAT FOR I DON'T
KNOW SAID LOMBIER
A CERTAIN JACQUELINE AN EXPEDITIOUS MAN ACCOSTED
SOME PASSING ARTISANS COME HERE YOU HE TREATED THEM TO TEN SOUS'
WORTH OF WINE AND SAID HAVE YOU WORK NO GO TO FILSPIERRE
BETWEEN THE BARRIERE CHARONNE AND THE BARRIERE MONTREUIL AND YOU WILL
FIND WORK AT FILSPIERRE'S THEY FOUND CARTRIDGES AND ARMS
CERTAIN
WELL KNOWN LEADERS WERE GOING THE ROUNDS THAT IS TO SAY RUNNING FROM
ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER TO COLLECT THEIR MEN
AT BARTHELEMY'S NEAR THE
BARRIERE DU TRONE AT CAPEL'S NEAR THE PETIT CHAPEAU THE DRINKERS
ACCOSTED EACH OTHER WITH A GRAVE AIR
THEY WERE HEARD TO SAY HAVE YOU
YOUR PISTOL UNDER MY BLOUSE AND YOU UNDER MY SHIRT IN THE
RUE TRAVERSIERE IN FRONT OF THE BLAND WORKSHOP AND IN THE YARD OF
THE MAISON BRULEE IN FRONT OF TOOL MAKER BERNIER'S GROUPS WHISPERED
TOGETHER
AMONG THEM WAS OBSERVED A CERTAIN MAVOT WHO NEVER REMAINED
MORE THAN A WEEK IN ONE SHOP AS THE MASTERS ALWAYS DISCHARGED HIM
BECAUSE THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DISPUTE WITH HIM EVERY DAY MAVOT WAS
KILLED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE MENILMONTANT
PRETOT WHO WAS DESTINED TO PERISH ALSO IN THE STRUGGLE SECONDED MAVOT
AND TO THE QUESTION WHAT IS YOUR OBJECT HE REPLIED INSURRECTION
WORKMEN ASSEMBLED AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DE BERCY WAITED FOR A
CERTAIN LEMARIN THE REVOLUTIONARY AGENT FOR THE FAUBOURG SAINT MARCEAU
WATCHWORDS WERE EXCHANGED ALMOST PUBLICLY
ON THE 5TH OF JUNE ACCORDINGLY A DAY OF MINGLED RAIN AND SUN GENERAL
LAMARQUE'S FUNERAL PROCESSION TRAVERSED PARIS WITH OFFICIAL MILITARY
POMP SOMEWHAT AUGMENTED THROUGH PRECAUTION
TWO BATTALIONS WITH DRAPED
DRUMS AND REVERSED ARMS TEN THOUSAND NATIONAL GUARDS WITH THEIR SWORDS
AT THEIR SIDES ESCORTED THE COFFIN
THE HEARSE WAS DRAWN BY YOUNG MEN
THE OFFICERS OF THE INVALIDES CAME IMMEDIATELY BEHIND IT BEARING LAUREL
BRANCHES
THEN CAME AN INNUMERABLE STRANGE AGITATED MULTITUDE THE
SECTIONARIES OF THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE THE LAW SCHOOL THE MEDICAL
SCHOOL REFUGEES OF ALL NATIONALITIES AND SPANISH ITALIAN GERMAN
AND POLISH FLAGS TRICOLORED HORIZONTAL BANNERS EVERY POSSIBLE SORT OF
BANNER CHILDREN WAVING GREEN BOUGHS STONE CUTTERS AND CARPENTERS WHO
WERE ON STRIKE AT THE MOMENT PRINTERS WHO WERE RECOGNIZABLE BY THEIR
PAPER CAPS MARCHING TWO BY TWO THREE BY THREE UTTERING CRIES NEARLY
ALL OF THEM BRANDISHING STICKS SOME BRANDISHING SABRES WITHOUT ORDER
AND YET WITH A SINGLE SOUL NOW A TUMULTUOUS ROUT AGAIN A COLUMN
SQUADS CHOSE THEMSELVES LEADERS A MAN ARMED WITH A PAIR OF PISTOLS IN
FULL VIEW SEEMED TO PASS THE HOST IN REVIEW AND THE FILES SEPARATED
BEFORE HIM
ON THE SIDE ALLEYS OF THE BOULEVARDS IN THE BRANCHES OF THE
TREES ON BALCONIES IN WINDOWS ON THE ROOFS SWARMED THE HEADS OF MEN
WOMEN AND CHILDREN ALL EYES WERE FILLED WITH ANXIETY
AN ARMED THRONG
WAS PASSING AND A TERRIFIED THRONG LOOKED ON
THE GOVERNMENT ON ITS SIDE WAS TAKING OBSERVATIONS
IT OBSERVED WITH
ITS HAND ON ITS SWORD
FOUR SQUADRONS OF CARABINEERS COULD BE SEEN IN
THE PLACE LOUIS XV
IN THEIR SADDLES WITH THEIR TRUMPETS AT THEIR HEAD
CARTRIDGE BOXES FILLED AND MUSKETS LOADED ALL IN READINESS TO MARCH
IN THE LATIN COUNTRY AND AT THE JARDIN DES PLANTES THE MUNICIPAL GUARD

DRAGOONS AT THE GREVE HALF OF THE 12TH LIGHT INFANTRY THE OTHER
HALF BEING AT THE BASTILLE THE 6TH DRAGOONS AT THE CELESTINS AND THE
COURTYARD OF THE LOUVRE FULL OF ARTILLERY
THE REMAINDER OF THE TROOPS
WERE CONFINED TO THEIR BARRACKS WITHOUT RECKONING THE REGIMENTS OF THE
ENVIRONS OF PARIS
POWER BEING UNEASY HELD SUSPENDED OVER THE MENACING
MULTITUDE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SOLDIERS IN THE CITY AND THIRTY THOUSAND
IN THE BANLIEUE
DIVERS REPORTS WERE IN CIRCULATION IN THE CORTEGE
LEGITIMIST TRICKS
WERE HINTED AT THEY SPOKE OF THE DUC DE REICHSTADT WHOM GOD HAD MARKED
OUT FOR DEATH AT THAT VERY MOMENT WHEN THE POPULACE WERE DESIGNATING
HIM FOR THE EMPIRE
ONE PERSONAGE WHOSE NAME HAS REMAINED UNKNOWN
ANNOUNCED THAT AT A GIVEN HOUR TWO OVERSEERS WHO HAD BEEN WON OVER
WOULD THROW OPEN THE DOORS OF A FACTORY OF ARMS TO THE PEOPLE
THAT
WHICH PREDOMINATED ON THE UNCOVERED BROWS OF THE MAJORITY OF THOSE
PRESENT WAS ENTHUSIASM MINGLED WITH DEJECTION
HERE AND THERE ALSO IN
THAT MULTITUDE GIVEN OVER TO SUCH VIOLENT BUT NOBLE EMOTIONS THERE WERE
VISIBLE GENUINE VISAGES OF CRIMINALS AND IGNOBLE MOUTHS WHICH SAID LET
US PLUNDER THERE ARE CERTAIN AGITATIONS WHICH STIR UP THE BOTTOMS OF
MARSHES AND MAKE CLOUDS OF MUD RISE THROUGH THE WATER
A PHENOMENON TO
WHICH WELL DRILLED POLICEMEN ARE NO STRANGERS
THE PROCESSION PROCEEDED WITH FEVERISH SLOWNESS FROM THE HOUSE OF THE
DECEASED BY WAY OF THE BOULEVARDS AS FAR AS THE BASTILLE
IT RAINED
FROM TIME TO TIME THE RAIN MATTERED NOTHING TO THAT THRONG
MANY
INCIDENTS THE COFFIN BORNE ROUND THE VENDOME COLUMN STONES THROWN AT
THE DUC DE FITZ JAMES WHO WAS SEEN ON A BALCONY WITH HIS HAT ON HIS
HEAD THE GALLIC COCK TORN FROM A POPULAR FLAG AND DRAGGED IN THE MIRE
A POLICEMAN WOUNDED WITH A BLOW FROM A SWORD AT THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN
AN OFFICER OF THE 12TH LIGHT INFANTRY SAYING ALOUD I AM A REPUBLICAN
THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL COMING UP UNEXPECTEDLY AGAINST ORDERS TO REMAIN

REPUBLIC MARKED THE PASSAGE OF THE FUNERAL TRAIN
AT THE BASTILLE
LONG FILES OF CURIOUS AND FORMIDABLE PEOPLE WHO DESCENDED FROM THE
FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE EFFECTED A JUNCTION WITH THE PROCESSION AND A
CERTAIN TERRIBLE SEETHING BEGAN TO AGITATE THE THRONG
ONE MAN WAS HEARD TO SAY TO ANOTHER DO YOU SEE THAT FELLOW WITH A
RED BEARD HE'S THE ONE WHO WILL GIVE THE WORD WHEN WE ARE TO FIRE IT
APPEARS THAT THIS RED BEARD WAS PRESENT AT ANOTHER RIOT THE QUENISSET
AFFAIR ENTRUSTED WITH THIS SAME FUNCTION
THE HEARSE PASSED THE BASTILLE TRAVERSED THE SMALL BRIDGE AND REACHED
THE ESPLANADE OF THE BRIDGE OF AUSTERLITZ
THERE IT HALTED
THE CROWD
SURVEYED AT THAT MOMENT WITH A BIRD'SEYE VIEW WOULD HAVE PRESENTED THE
ASPECT OF A COMET WHOSE HEAD WAS ON THE ESPLANADE AND WHOSE TAIL SPREAD
OUT OVER THE QUAI BOURDON COVERED THE BASTILLE AND WAS PROLONGED ON
THE BOULEVARD AS FAR AS THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN
A CIRCLE WAS TRACED
AROUND THE HEARSE
THE VAST ROUT HELD THEIR PEACE
LAFAYETTE SPOKE AND
BADE LAMARQUE FAREWELL
THIS WAS A TOUCHING AND AUGUST INSTANT ALL
HEADS UNCOVERED ALL HEARTS BEAT HIGH
ALL AT ONCE A MAN ON HORSEBACK CLAD IN BLACK MADE HIS APPEARANCE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUP WITH A RED FLAG OTHERS SAY WITH A PIKE
SURMOUNTED WITH A RED LIBERTY CAP
LAFAYETTE TURNED ASIDE HIS HEAD
EXELMANS QUITTED THE PROCESSION
THIS RED FLAG RAISED A STORM AND DISAPPEARED IN THE MIDST OF IT
FROM
THE BOULEVARD BOURDON TO THE BRIDGE OF AUSTERLITZ ONE OF THOSE CLAMORS
WHICH RESEMBLE BILLOWS STIRRED THE MULTITUDE
TWO PRODIGIOUS SHOUTS WENT
UP LAMARQUE TO THE PANTHEON LAFAYETTE TO THE TOWN HALL SOME YOUNG
MEN AMID THE DECLAMATIONS OF THE THRONG HARNESSED THEMSELVES AND
BEGAN TO DRAG LAMARQUE IN THE HEARSE ACROSS THE BRIDGE OF AUSTERLITZ AND
LAFAYETTE IN A HACKNEY COACH ALONG THE QUAI MORLAND
IN THE CROWD WHICH SURROUNDED AND CHEERED LAFAYETTE IT WAS NOTICED
THAT A GERMAN SHOWED HIMSELF NAMED LUDWIG SNYDER WHO DIED A CENTENARIAN
AFTERWARDS WHO HAD ALSO BEEN IN THE WAR OF 1776 AND WHO HAD FOUGHT AT
TRENTON UNDER WASHINGTON AND AT BRANDYWINE UNDER LAFAYETTE
IN THE MEANTIME THE MUNICIPAL CAVALRY ON THE LEFT BANK HAD BEEN SET
IN MOTION AND CAME TO BAR THE BRIDGE ON THE RIGHT BANK THE DRAGOONS
EMERGED FROM THE CELESTINS AND DEPLOYED ALONG THE QUAI MORLAND
THE MEN
WHO WERE DRAGGING LAFAYETTE SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THEM AT THE CORNER
OF THE QUAY AND SHOUTED THE DRAGOONS THE DRAGOONS ADVANCED AT A
WALK IN SILENCE WITH THEIR PISTOLS IN THEIR HOLSTERS THEIR SWORDS IN
THEIR SCABBARDS THEIR GUNS SLUNG IN THEIR LEATHER SOCKETS WITH AN AIR
OF GLOOMY EXPECTATION
THEY HALTED TWO HUNDRED PACES FROM THE LITTLE BRIDGE
THE CARRIAGE IN
WHICH SAT LAFAYETTE ADVANCED TO THEM THEIR RANKS OPENED AND ALLOWED IT
TO PASS AND THEN CLOSED BEHIND IT
AT THAT MOMENT THE DRAGOONS AND THE
CROWD TOUCHED
THE WOMEN FLED IN TERROR
WHAT TOOK PLACE DURING THAT
FATAL MINUTE NO ONE CAN SAY
IT IS THE DARK MOMENT WHEN TWO CLOUDS COME
TOGETHER
SOME DECLARE THAT A BLAST OF TRUMPETS SOUNDING THE CHARGE WAS
HEARD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ARSENAL OTHERS THAT A BLOW FROM A DAGGER
WAS GIVEN BY A CHILD TO A DRAGOON
THE FACT IS THAT THREE SHOTS WERE
SUDDENLY DISCHARGED THE FIRST KILLED CHOLET CHIEF OF THE SQUADRON
THE SECOND KILLED AN OLD DEAF WOMAN WHO WAS IN THE ACT OF CLOSING HER
WINDOW THE THIRD SINGED THE SHOULDER OF AN OFFICER A WOMAN SCREAMED
THEY ARE BEGINNING TOO SOON AND ALL AT ONCE A SQUADRON OF DRAGOONS
WHICH HAD REMAINED IN THE BARRACKS UP TO THIS TIME WAS SEEN TO DEBOUCH
AT A GALLOP WITH BARED SWORDS THROUGH THE RUE BASSOMPIERRE AND THE
BOULEVARD BOURDON SWEEPING ALL BEFORE THEM
THEN ALL IS SAID THE TEMPEST IS LOOSED STONES RAIN DOWN A FUSILLADE
BREAKS FORTH MANY PRECIPITATE THEMSELVES TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BANK AND
PASS THE SMALL ARM OF THE SEINE NOW FILLED IN THE TIMBER YARDS OF THE
ISLE LOUVIERS THAT VAST CITADEL READY TO HAND BRISTLE WITH COMBATANTS
STAKES ARE TORN UP PISTOL SHOTS FIRED A BARRICADE BEGUN THE YOUNG MEN
WHO ARE THRUST BACK PASS THE AUSTERLITZ BRIDGE WITH THE HEARSE AT A RUN
AND THE MUNICIPAL GUARD THE CARABINEERS RUSH UP THE DRAGOONS PLY THEIR
SWORDS THE CROWD DISPERSES IN ALL DIRECTIONS A RUMOR OF WAR FLIES TO
ALL FOUR QUARTERS OF PARIS MEN SHOUT TO ARMS THEY RUN TUMBLE DOWN
FLEE RESIST
WRATH SPREADS ABROAD THE RIOT AS WIND SPREADS A FIRE
CHAPTER IV THE EBULLITIONS OF FORMER DAYS
NOTHING IS MORE EXTRAORDINARY THAN THE FIRST BREAKING OUT OF A RIOT
EVERYTHING BURSTS FORTH EVERYWHERE AT ONCE
WAS IT FORESEEN YES
WAS IT
PREPARED NO
WHENCE COMES IT FROM THE PAVEMENTS
WHENCE FALLS IT FROM
THE CLOUDS
HERE INSURRECTION ASSUMES THE CHARACTER OF A PLOT THERE
OF AN IMPROVISATION
THE FIRST COMER SEIZES A CURRENT OF THE THRONG
AND LEADS IT WHITHER HE WILLS
A BEGINNING FULL OF TERROR IN WHICH IS
MINGLED A SORT OF FORMIDABLE GAYETY
FIRST COME CLAMORS THE SHOPS ARE
CLOSED THE DISPLAYS OF THE MERCHANTS DISAPPEAR THEN COME ISOLATED
SHOTS PEOPLE FLEE BLOWS FROM GUN STOCKS BEAT AGAINST PORTES COCHERES
SERVANTS CAN BE HEARD LAUGHING IN THE COURTYARDS OF HOUSES AND SAYING
THERE'S GOING TO BE A ROW
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD NOT ELAPSED WHEN THIS IS WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE
AT TWENTY DIFFERENT SPOTS IN PARIS AT ONCE
IN THE RUE SAINTE CROIX DE LA BRETONNERIE TWENTY YOUNG MEN BEARDED AND
WITH LONG HAIR ENTERED A DRAM SHOP AND EMERGED A MOMENT LATER CARRYING
A HORIZONTAL TRICOLORED FLAG COVERED WITH CRAPE AND HAVING AT THEIR
HEAD THREE MEN ARMED ONE WITH A SWORD ONE WITH A GUN AND THE THIRD
WITH A PIKE
IN THE RUE DES NONAINDIERES A VERY WELL DRESSED BOURGEOIS WHO HAD A
PROMINENT BELLY A SONOROUS VOICE A BALD HEAD A LOFTY BROW A BLACK
BEARD AND ONE OF THESE STIFF MUSTACHES WHICH WILL NOT LIE FLAT OFFERED
CARTRIDGES PUBLICLY TO PASSERS BY
IN THE RUE SAINT PIERRE MONTMARTRE MEN WITH BARE ARMS CARRIED ABOUT A
BLACK FLAG ON WHICH COULD BE READ IN WHITE LETTERS THIS INSCRIPTION
REPUBLIC OR DEATH IN THE RUE DES JEUNEURS RUE DU CADRAN RUE
MONTORGUEIL RUE MANDAR GROUPS APPEARED WAVING FLAGS ON WHICH COULD BE
DISTINGUISHED IN GOLD LETTERS THE WORD SECTION WITH A NUMBER
ONE OF
THESE FLAGS WAS RED AND BLUE WITH AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE STRIPE OF
WHITE BETWEEN
THEY PILLAGED A FACTORY OF SMALL ARMS ON THE BOULEVARD SAINT MARTIN AND
THREE ARMORERS' SHOPS THE FIRST IN THE RUE BEAUBOURG THE SECOND IN THE
RUE MICHEL LE COMTE THE OTHER IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE
IN A FEW MINUTES
THE THOUSAND HANDS OF THE CROWD HAD SEIZED AND CARRIED OFF TWO HUNDRED
AND THIRTY GUNS NEARLY ALL DOUBLE BARRELLED SIXTY FOUR SWORDS AND
EIGHTY THREE PISTOLS
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE MORE ARMS ONE MAN TOOK THE
GUN THE OTHER THE BAYONET
OPPOSITE THE QUAI DE LA GREVE YOUNG MEN ARMED WITH MUSKETS INSTALLED
THEMSELVES IN THE HOUSES OF SOME WOMEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF FIRING
ONE
OF THEM HAD A FLINT LOCK
THEY RANG ENTERED AND SET ABOUT MAKING
CARTRIDGES
ONE OF THESE WOMEN RELATES I DID NOT KNOW WHAT CARTRIDGES
WERE IT WAS MY HUSBAND WHO TOLD ME
ONE CLUSTER BROKE INTO A CURIOSITY SHOP IN THE RUE DES VIELLES
HAUDRIETTES AND SEIZED YATAGHANS AND TURKISH ARMS
THE BODY OF A MASON WHO HAD BEEN KILLED BY A GUN SHOT LAY IN THE RUE DE
LA PERLE
AND THEN ON THE RIGHT BANK THE LEFT BANK ON THE QUAYS ON THE
BOULEVARDS IN THE LATIN COUNTRY IN THE QUARTER OF THE HALLES PANTING
MEN ARTISANS STUDENTS MEMBERS OF SECTIONS READ PROCLAMATIONS AND
SHOUTED TO ARMS BROKE STREET LANTERNS UNHARNESSED CARRIAGES
UNPAVED THE STREETS BROKE IN THE DOORS OF HOUSES UPROOTED TREES
RUMMAGED CELLARS ROLLED OUT HOGSHEADS HEAPED UP PAVING STONES ROUGH
SLABS FURNITURE AND PLANKS AND MADE BARRICADES
THEY FORCED THE BOURGEOIS TO ASSIST THEM IN THIS
THEY ENTERED THE
DWELLINGS OF WOMEN THEY FORCED THEM TO HAND OVER THE SWORDS AND GUNS
OF THEIR ABSENT HUSBANDS AND THEY WROTE ON THE DOOR WITH WHITING THE
ARMS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED SOME SIGNED THEIR NAMES TO RECEIPTS FOR
THE GUNS AND SWORDS AND SAID SEND FOR THEM TO MORROW AT THE MAYOR'S
OFFICE THEY DISARMED ISOLATED SENTINELS AND NATIONAL GUARDSMEN IN
THE STREETS ON THEIR WAY TO THE TOWNHALL
THEY TORE THE EPAULETS FROM
OFFICERS
IN THE RUE DU CIMITIERE SAINT NICHOLAS AN OFFICER OF THE
NATIONAL GUARD ON BEING PURSUED BY A CROWD ARMED WITH CLUBS AND FOILS
TOOK REFUGE WITH DIFFICULTY IN A HOUSE WHENCE HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO
EMERGE AT NIGHTFALL AND IN DISGUISE
IN THE QUARTIER SAINT JACQUES THE STUDENTS SWARMED OUT OF THEIR
HOTELS AND ASCENDED THE RUE SAINT HYACINTHE TO THE CAFE DU PROGRESS
OR DESCENDED TO THE CAFE DES SEPT BILLARDS IN THE RUE DES MATHURINS
THERE IN FRONT OF THE DOOR YOUNG MEN MOUNTED ON THE STONE
CORNER POSTS DISTRIBUTED ARMS
THEY PLUNDERED THE TIMBER YARD IN THE
RUE TRANSNONAIN IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MATERIAL FOR BARRICADES
ON A SINGLE
POINT THE INHABITANTS RESISTED AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE SAINTE AVOYE
AND THE RUE SIMON LE FRANC WHERE THEY DESTROYED THE BARRICADE WITH
THEIR OWN HANDS
AT A SINGLE POINT THE INSURGENTS YIELDED THEY
ABANDONED A BARRICADE BEGUN IN THE RUE DE TEMPLE AFTER HAVING FIRED ON
A DETACHMENT OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND FLED THROUGH THE RUE DE LA
CORDERIE
THE DETACHMENT PICKED UP IN THE BARRICADE A RED FLAG A
PACKAGE OF CARTRIDGES AND THREE HUNDRED PISTOL BALLS
THE NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN TORE UP THE FLAG AND CARRIED OFF ITS TATTERED REMAINS ON THE
POINTS OF THEIR BAYONETS
ALL THAT WE ARE HERE RELATING SLOWLY AND SUCCESSIVELY TOOK PLACE
SIMULTANEOUSLY AT ALL POINTS OF THE CITY IN THE MIDST OF A VAST TUMULT
LIKE A MASS OF TONGUES OF LIGHTNING IN ONE CLAP OF THUNDER
IN LESS THAN
AN HOUR TWENTY SEVEN BARRICADES SPRANG OUT OF THE EARTH IN THE QUARTER
OF THE HALLES ALONE
IN THE CENTRE WAS THAT FAMOUS HOUSE NO
50 WHICH
WAS THE FORTRESS OF JEANNE AND HER SIX HUNDRED COMPANIONS AND WHICH
FLANKED ON THE ONE HAND BY A BARRICADE AT SAINT MERRY AND ON THE OTHER
BY A BARRICADE OF THE RUE MAUBUEE COMMANDED THREE STREETS THE RUE
DES ARCIS THE RUE SAINT MARTIN AND THE RUE AUBRY LE BOUCHER WHICH
IT FACED
THE BARRICADES AT RIGHT ANGLES FELL BACK THE ONE OF THE
RUE MONTORGUEIL ON THE GRANDE TRUANDERIE THE OTHER OF THE RUE
GEOFFROY LANGEVIN ON THE RUE SAINTE AVOYE
WITHOUT RECKONING INNUMERABLE
BARRICADES IN TWENTY OTHER QUARTERS OF PARIS IN THE MARAIS AT
MONT SAINTE GENEVIEVE ONE IN THE RUE MENILMONTANT WHERE WAS VISIBLE
A PORTE COCHERE TORN FROM ITS HINGES ANOTHER NEAR THE LITTLE BRIDGE OF
THE HOTEL DIEU MADE WITH AN ECOSSAIS WHICH HAD BEEN UNHARNESSED AND
OVERTHROWN THREE HUNDRED PACES FROM THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE
AT THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE DES MENETRIERS A WELL DRESSED MAN
DISTRIBUTED MONEY TO THE WORKMEN
AT THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE GRENETAT
A HORSEMAN MADE HIS APPEARANCE AND HANDED TO THE ONE WHO SEEMED TO BE
THE COMMANDER OF THE BARRICADE WHAT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A ROLL OF
SILVER
HERE SAID HE THIS IS TO PAY EXPENSES WINE ET CAETERA
A LIGHT HAIRED YOUNG MAN WITHOUT A CRAVAT WENT FROM BARRICADE TO
BARRICADE CARRYING PASS WORDS
ANOTHER WITH A NAKED SWORD A BLUE
POLICE CAP ON HIS HEAD PLACED SENTINELS
IN THE INTERIOR BEYOND THE
BARRICADES THE WINE SHOPS AND PORTERS' LODGES WERE CONVERTED INTO
GUARD HOUSES
OTHERWISE THE RIOT WAS CONDUCTED AFTER THE MOST SCIENTIFIC
MILITARY TACTICS
THE NARROW UNEVEN SINUOUS STREETS FULL OF ANGLES
AND TURNS WERE ADMIRABLY CHOSEN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HALLES IN
PARTICULAR A NETWORK OF STREETS MORE INTRICATE THAN A FOREST
THE
SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE HAD IT WAS SAID UNDERTAKEN TO
DIRECT THE INSURRECTION IN THE QUARTIER SAINTE AVOYE
A MAN KILLED IN
THE RUE DU PONCEAU WHO WAS SEARCHED HAD ON HIS PERSON A PLAN OF PARIS
THAT WHICH HAD REALLY UNDERTAKEN THE DIRECTION OF THE UPRISING WAS A
SORT OF STRANGE IMPETUOSITY WHICH WAS IN THE AIR
THE INSURRECTION
HAD ABRUPTLY BUILT BARRICADES WITH ONE HAND AND WITH THE OTHER SEIZED
NEARLY ALL THE POSTS OF THE GARRISON
IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS LIKE A
TRAIN OF POWDER CATCHING FIRE THE INSURGENTS HAD INVADED AND OCCUPIED
ON THE RIGHT BANK THE ARSENAL THE MAYORALTY OF THE PLACE ROYALE THE
WHOLE OF THE MARAIS THE POPINCOURT ARMS MANUFACTORY LA GALIOTE THE
CHATEAU D'EAU AND ALL THE STREETS NEAR THE HALLES ON THE LEFT BANK
THE BARRACKS OF THE VETERANS SAINTE PELAGIE THE PLACE MAUBERT THE
POWDER MAGAZINE OF THE DEUX MOULINS AND ALL THE BARRIERS
AT FIVE
O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THEY WERE MASTERS OF THE BASTILLE OF THE
LINGERIE OF THE BLANCS MANTEAUX THEIR SCOUTS HAD REACHED THE PLACE
DES VICTOIRES AND MENACED THE BANK THE PETITS PERES BARRACKS AND THE
POST OFFICE
A THIRD OF PARIS WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE RIOTERS
THE CONFLICT HAD BEEN BEGUN ON A GIGANTIC SCALE AT ALL POINTS AND AS A
RESULT OF THE DISARMING DOMICILIARY VISITS AND ARMORERS' SHOPS HASTILY
INVADED WAS THAT THE COMBAT WHICH HAD BEGUN WITH THE THROWING OF
STONES WAS CONTINUED WITH GUN SHOTS
ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE PASSAGE DU SAUMON BECAME THE FIELD
OF BATTLE
THE UPRISING WAS AT ONE END THE TROOPS WERE AT THE OTHER
THEY FIRED FROM ONE GATE TO THE OTHER
AN OBSERVER A DREAMER THE
AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK WHO HAD GONE TO GET A NEAR VIEW OF THIS VOLCANO
FOUND HIMSELF IN THE PASSAGE BETWEEN THE TWO FIRES
ALL THAT HE HAD TO
PROTECT HIM FROM THE BULLETS WAS THE SWELL OF THE TWO HALF COLUMNS WHICH
SEPARATE THE SHOPS HE REMAINED IN THIS DELICATE SITUATION FOR NEARLY
HALF AN HOUR
MEANWHILE THE CALL TO ARMS WAS BEATEN THE NATIONAL GUARD ARMED IN
HASTE THE LEGIONS EMERGED FROM THE MAYORALITIES THE REGIMENTS FROM
THEIR BARRACKS
OPPOSITE THE PASSAGE DE L'ANCRE A DRUMMER RECEIVED A
BLOW FROM A DAGGER
ANOTHER IN THE RUE DU CYGNE WAS ASSAILED BY THIRTY
YOUNG MEN WHO BROKE HIS INSTRUMENT AND TOOK AWAY HIS SWORD
ANOTHER WAS
KILLED IN THE RUE GRENIER SAINT LAZARE
IN THE RUE MICHELLE COMTE THREE
OFFICERS FELL DEAD ONE AFTER THE OTHER
MANY OF THE MUNICIPAL GUARDS ON
BEING WOUNDED IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS RETREATED
IN FRONT OF THE COUR BATAVE A DETACHMENT OF NATIONAL GUARDS FOUND A RED
FLAG BEARING THE FOLLOWING INSCRIPTION REPUBLICAN REVOLUTION NO
127
WAS THIS A REVOLUTION IN FACT
THE INSURRECTION HAD MADE OF THE CENTRE OF PARIS A SORT OF INEXTRICABLE
TORTUOUS COLOSSAL CITADEL
THERE WAS THE HEARTH THERE EVIDENTLY WAS THE QUESTION
ALL THE REST
WAS NOTHING BUT SKIRMISHES
THE PROOF THAT ALL WOULD BE DECIDED THERE
LAY IN THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO FIGHTING GOING ON THERE AS YET
IN SOME REGIMENTS THE SOLDIERS WERE UNCERTAIN WHICH ADDED TO THE
FEARFUL UNCERTAINTY OF THE CRISIS
THEY RECALLED THE POPULAR OVATION
WHICH HAD GREETED THE NEUTRALITY OF THE 53D OF THE LINE IN JULY 1830
TWO INTREPID MEN TRIED IN GREAT WARS THE MARSHAL LOBAU AND GENERAL
BUGEAUD WERE IN COMMAND BUGEAUD UNDER LOBAU
ENORMOUS PATROLS
COMPOSED OF BATTALIONS OF THE LINE ENCLOSED IN ENTIRE COMPANIES OF THE
NATIONAL GUARD AND PRECEDED BY A COMMISSARY OF POLICE WEARING HIS SCARF
OF OFFICE WENT TO RECONNOITRE THE STREETS IN REBELLION
THE INSURGENTS
ON THEIR SIDE PLACED VIDETTES AT THE CORNERS OF ALL OPEN SPACES AND
AUDACIOUSLY SENT THEIR PATROLS OUTSIDE THE BARRICADES
EACH SIDE WAS
WATCHING THE OTHER
THE GOVERNMENT WITH AN ARMY IN ITS HAND HESITATED
THE NIGHT WAS ALMOST UPON THEM AND THE SAINT MERRY TOCSIN BEGAN TO MAKE
ITSELF HEARD
THE MINISTER OF WAR AT THAT TIME MARSHAL SOULT WHO HAD
SEEN AUSTERLITZ REGARDED THIS WITH A GLOOMY AIR
THESE OLD SAILORS ACCUSTOMED TO CORRECT MANOEUVRES AND HAVING AS
RESOURCE AND GUIDE ONLY TACTICS THAT COMPASS OF BATTLES ARE UTTERLY
DISCONCERTED IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT IMMENSE FOAM WHICH IS CALLED PUBLIC
WRATH
THE NATIONAL GUARDS OF THE SUBURBS RUSHED UP IN HASTE AND DISORDER
A
BATTALION OF THE 12TH LIGHT CAME AT A RUN FROM SAINT DENIS THE 14TH OF
THE LINE ARRIVED FROM COURBEVOIE THE BATTERIES OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL
HAD TAKEN UP THEIR POSITION ON THE CARROUSEL CANNONS WERE DESCENDING
FROM VINCENNES
SOLITUDE WAS FORMED AROUND THE TUILERIES
LOUIS PHILIPPE WAS PERFECTLY
SERENE
CHAPTER V ORIGINALITY OF PARIS
DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS AS WE HAVE SAID PARIS HAD WITNESSED MORE
THAN ONE INSURRECTION
NOTHING IS GENERALLY MORE SINGULARLY CALM THAN
THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF PARIS DURING AN UPRISING BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF
THE REBELLIOUS QUARTERS
PARIS VERY SPEEDILY ACCUSTOMS HERSELF TO
ANYTHING IT IS ONLY A RIOT AND PARIS HAS SO MANY AFFAIRS ON HAND
THAT SHE DOES NOT PUT HERSELF OUT FOR SO SMALL A MATTER
THESE COLOSSAL
CITIES ALONE CAN OFFER SUCH SPECTACLES
THESE IMMENSE ENCLOSURES ALONE
CAN CONTAIN AT THE SAME TIME CIVIL WAR AND AN ODD AND INDESCRIBABLE
TRANQUILLITY
ORDINARILY WHEN AN INSURRECTION COMMENCES WHEN THE
SHOP KEEPER HEARS THE DRUM THE CALL TO ARMS THE GENERAL ALARM HE
CONTENTS HIMSELF WITH THE REMARK
THERE APPEARS TO BE A SQUABBLE IN THE RUE SAINT MARTIN
OR
IN THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE
OFTEN HE ADDS CARELESSLY
OR SOMEWHERE IN THAT DIRECTION
LATER ON WHEN THE HEART RENDING AND MOURNFUL HUBBUB OF MUSKETRY AND
FIRING BY PLATOONS BECOMES AUDIBLE THE SHOPKEEPER SAYS
IT'S GETTING HOT HULLO IT'S GETTING HOT
A MOMENT LATER THE RIOT APPROACHES AND GAINS IN FORCE HE SHUTS UP HIS
SHOP PRECIPITATELY HASTILY DONS HIS UNIFORM THAT IS TO SAY HE PLACES
HIS MERCHANDISE IN SAFETY AND RISKS HIS OWN PERSON
MEN FIRE IN A SQUARE IN A PASSAGE IN A BLIND ALLEY THEY TAKE AND
RE TAKE THE BARRICADE BLOOD FLOWS THE GRAPE SHOT RIDDLES THE FRONTS
OF THE HOUSES THE BALLS KILL PEOPLE IN THEIR BEDS CORPSES ENCUMBER THE
STREETS
A FEW STREETS AWAY THE SHOCK OF BILLIARD BALLS CAN BE HEARD IN
THE CAFES
THE THEATRES OPEN THEIR DOORS AND PRESENT VAUDEVILLES THE CURIOUS LAUGH
AND CHAT A COUPLE OF PACES DISTANT FROM THESE STREETS FILLED WITH
WAR
HACKNEY CARRIAGES GO THEIR WAY PASSERS BY ARE GOING TO A DINNER
SOMEWHERE IN TOWN
SOMETIMES IN THE VERY QUARTER WHERE THE FIGHTING IS
GOING ON
IN 1831 A FUSILLADE WAS STOPPED TO ALLOW A WEDDING PARTY TO PASS
AT THE TIME OF THE INSURRECTION OF 1839 IN THE RUE SAINT MARTIN A
LITTLE INFIRM OLD MAN PUSHING A HAND CART SURMOUNTED BY A TRICOLORED
RAG IN WHICH HE HAD CARAFES FILLED WITH SOME SORT OF LIQUID WENT AND
CAME FROM BARRICADE TO TROOPS AND FROM TROOPS TO THE BARRICADE OFFERING
HIS GLASSES OF COCOA IMPARTIALLY NOW TO THE GOVERNMENT NOW TO
ANARCHY
NOTHING CAN BE STRANGER AND THIS IS THE PECULIAR CHARACTER OF UPRISINGS
IN PARIS WHICH CANNOT BE FOUND IN ANY OTHER CAPITAL
TO THIS END TWO
THINGS ARE REQUISITE THE SIZE OF PARIS AND ITS GAYETY
THE CITY OF
VOLTAIRE AND NAPOLEON IS NECESSARY
ON THIS OCCASION HOWEVER IN THE RESORT TO ARMS OF JUNE 25TH 1832 THE
GREAT CITY FELT SOMETHING WHICH WAS PERHAPS STRONGER THAN ITSELF
IT
WAS AFRAID
CLOSED DOORS WINDOWS AND SHUTTERS WERE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE IN THE
MOST DISTANT AND MOST DISINTERESTED QUARTERS
THE COURAGEOUS TOOK TO
ARMS THE POLTROONS HID
THE BUSY AND HEEDLESS PASSER BY DISAPPEARED
MANY STREETS WERE EMPTY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
ALARMING DETAILS WERE HAWKED ABOUT FATAL NEWS WAS DISSEMINATED THAT
THEY WERE MASTERS OF THE BANK THAT THERE WERE SIX HUNDRED OF THEM
IN THE CLOISTER OF SAINT MERRY ALONE ENTRENCHED AND EMBATTLED IN THE
CHURCH THAT THE LINE WAS NOT TO BE DEPENDED ON THAT ARMAND CARREL
HAD BEEN TO SEE MARSHAL CLAUSEL AND THAT THE MARSHAL HAD SAID GET A
REGIMENT FIRST THAT LAFAYETTE WAS ILL BUT THAT HE HAD SAID TO THEM
NEVERTHELESS I AM WITH YOU
I WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER THERE IS ROOM
FOR A CHAIR THAT ONE MUST BE ON ONE'S GUARD THAT AT NIGHT THERE WOULD
BE PEOPLE PILLAGING ISOLATED DWELLINGS IN THE DESERTED CORNERS OF PARIS
THERE THE IMAGINATION OF THE POLICE THAT ANNE RADCLIFFE MIXED UP WITH
THE GOVERNMENT WAS RECOGNIZABLE THAT A BATTERY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED
IN THE RUE AUBRY LE BOUCHER THAT LOBAU AND BUGEAUD WERE PUTTING THEIR
HEADS TOGETHER AND THAT AT MIDNIGHT OR AT DAYBREAK AT LATEST FOUR
COLUMNS WOULD MARCH SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THE CENTRE OF THE UPRISING THE
FIRST COMING FROM THE BASTILLE THE SECOND FROM THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN
THE THIRD FROM THE GREVE THE FOURTH FROM THE HALLES THAT PERHAPS
ALSO THE TROOPS WOULD EVACUATE PARIS AND WITHDRAW TO THE CHAMP DE MARS
THAT NO ONE KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN BUT THAT THIS TIME IT CERTAINLY WAS
SERIOUS
PEOPLE BUSIED THEMSELVES OVER MARSHAL SOULT'S HESITATIONS
WHY DID NOT
HE ATTACK AT ONCE IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE WAS PROFOUNDLY ABSORBED
THE
OLD LION SEEMED TO SCENT AN UNKNOWN MONSTER IN THAT GLOOM
EVENING CAME THE THEATRES DID NOT OPEN THE PATROLS CIRCULATED WITH
AN AIR OF IRRITATION PASSERS BY WERE SEARCHED SUSPICIOUS PERSONS WERE
ARRESTED
BY NINE O'CLOCK MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED PERSONS HAD BEEN
ARRESTED THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE WAS ENCUMBERED WITH THEM SO WAS THE
CONCIERGERIE SO WAS LA FORCE
AT THE CONCIERGERIE IN PARTICULAR THE LONG VAULT WHICH IS CALLED THE
RUE DE PARIS WAS LITTERED WITH TRUSSES OF STRAW UPON WHICH LAY A HEAP
OF PRISONERS WHOM THE MAN OF LYONS LAGRANGE HARANGUED VALIANTLY
ALL THAT STRAW RUSTLED BY ALL THESE MEN PRODUCED THE SOUND OF A HEAVY
SHOWER
ELSEWHERE PRISONERS SLEPT IN THE OPEN AIR IN THE MEADOWS PILED
ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
ANXIETY REIGNED EVERYWHERE AND A CERTAIN TREMOR WHICH WAS NOT HABITUAL
WITH PARIS
PEOPLE BARRICADED THEMSELVES IN THEIR HOUSES WIVES AND MOTHERS WERE
UNEASY NOTHING WAS TO BE HEARD BUT THIS AH MY GOD HE HAS NOT COME
HOME THERE WAS HARDLY EVEN THE DISTANT RUMBLE OF A VEHICLE TO BE
HEARD
PEOPLE LISTENED ON THEIR THRESHOLDS TO THE RUMORS THE SHOUTS THE
TUMULT THE DULL AND INDISTINCT SOUNDS TO THE THINGS THAT WERE
SAID IT IS CAVALRY OR THOSE ARE THE CAISSONS GALLOPING TO THE
TRUMPETS THE DRUMS THE FIRING AND ABOVE ALL TO THAT LAMENTABLE
ALARM PEAL FROM SAINT MERRY
THEY WAITED FOR THE FIRST CANNON SHOT
MEN SPRANG UP AT THE CORNERS OF
THE STREETS AND DISAPPEARED SHOUTING GO HOME AND PEOPLE MADE HASTE
TO BOLT THEIR DOORS
THEY SAID HOW WILL ALL THIS END FROM MOMENT TO
MOMENT IN PROPORTION AS THE DARKNESS DESCENDED PARIS SEEMED TO TAKE ON
A MORE MOURNFUL HUE FROM THE FORMIDABLE FLAMING OF THE REVOLT
BOOK ELEVENTH THE ATOM FRATERNIZES WITH THE HURRICANE
CHAPTER I SOME EXPLANATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ORIGIN OF GAVROCHE'S
POETRY
THE INFLUENCE OF AN ACADEMICIAN ON THIS POETRY
AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE INSURRECTION ARISING FROM THE SHOCK OF THE
POPULACE AND THE MILITARY IN FRONT OF THE ARSENAL STARTED A MOVEMENT
IN ADVANCE AND TOWARDS THE REAR IN THE MULTITUDE WHICH WAS FOLLOWING THE
HEARSE AND WHICH THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BOULEVARDS WEIGHED
SO TO SPEAK ON THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION THERE AROSE A FRIGHTFUL EBB
THE ROUT WAS SHAKEN THEIR RANKS WERE BROKEN ALL RAN FLED MADE THEIR
ESCAPE SOME WITH SHOUTS OF ATTACK OTHERS WITH THE PALLOR OF FLIGHT
THE GREAT RIVER WHICH COVERED THE BOULEVARDS DIVIDED IN A TWINKLING
OVERFLOWED TO RIGHT AND LEFT AND SPREAD IN TORRENTS OVER TWO HUNDRED
STREETS AT ONCE WITH THE ROAR OF A SEWER THAT HAS BROKEN LOOSE
AT THAT MOMENT A RAGGED CHILD WHO WAS COMING DOWN THROUGH THE RUE
MENILMONTANT HOLDING IN HIS HAND A BRANCH OF BLOSSOMING LABURNUM WHICH
HE HAD JUST PLUCKED ON THE HEIGHTS OF BELLEVILLE CAUGHT SIGHT OF AN OLD
HOLSTER PISTOL IN THE SHOW WINDOW OF A BRIC A BRAC MERCHANT'S SHOP
MOTHER WHAT'S YOUR NAME I'M GOING TO BORROW YOUR MACHINE
AND OFF HE RAN WITH THE PISTOL
TWO MINUTES LATER A FLOOD OF FRIGHTENED BOURGEOIS WHO WERE FLEEING
THROUGH THE RUE AMELOT AND THE RUE BASSE ENCOUNTERED THE LAD
BRANDISHING HIS PISTOL AND SINGING
LA NUIT ON NE VOIT RIEN
LE JOUR ON VOIT TRES BIEN
D'UN ECRIT APOCRYPHA
LE BOURGEOIS S'EBOURIFFE
PRATIQUEZ LA VERTU
TUTU CHAPEAU POINTU 44
IT WAS LITTLE GAVROCHE ON HIS WAY TO THE WARS
ON THE BOULEVARD HE NOTICED THAT THE PISTOL HAD NO TRIGGER
WHO WAS THE AUTHOR OF THAT COUPLET WHICH SERVED TO PUNCTUATE HIS MARCH
AND OF ALL THE OTHER SONGS WHICH HE WAS FOND OF SINGING ON OCCASION WE
KNOW NOT
WHO DOES KNOW HIMSELF PERHAPS
HOWEVER GAVROCHE WAS WELL
UP IN ALL THE POPULAR TUNES IN CIRCULATION AND HE MINGLED WITH THEM HIS
OWN CHIRPINGS
AN OBSERVING URCHIN AND A ROGUE HE MADE A POTPOURRI OF
THE VOICES OF NATURE AND THE VOICES OF PARIS
HE COMBINED THE REPERTORY
OF THE BIRDS WITH THE REPERTORY OF THE WORKSHOPS
HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH
THIEVES A TRIBE CONTIGUOUS TO HIS OWN
HE HAD IT APPEARS BEEN
FOR THREE MONTHS APPRENTICED TO A PRINTER
HE HAD ONE DAY EXECUTED A
COMMISSION FOR M
BAOUR LORMIAN ONE OF THE FORTY
GAVROCHE WAS A GAMIN
OF LETTERS
MOREOVER GAVROCHE HAD NO SUSPICION OF THE FACT THAT WHEN HE HAD OFFERED
THE HOSPITALITY OF HIS ELEPHANT TO TWO BRATS ON THAT VILLAINOUSLY
RAINY NIGHT IT WAS TO HIS OWN BROTHERS THAT HE HAD PLAYED THE PART OF
PROVIDENCE
HIS BROTHERS IN THE EVENING HIS FATHER IN THE MORNING
THAT IS WHAT HIS NIGHT HAD BEEN LIKE
ON QUITTING THE RUE DES BALLETS
AT DAYBREAK HE HAD RETURNED IN HASTE TO THE ELEPHANT HAD ARTISTICALLY
EXTRACTED FROM IT THE TWO BRATS HAD SHARED WITH THEM SOME SORT OF
BREAKFAST WHICH HE HAD INVENTED AND HAD THEN GONE AWAY CONFIDING
THEM TO THAT GOOD MOTHER THE STREET WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP ALMOST
ENTIRELY
ON LEAVING THEM HE HAD APPOINTED TO MEET THEM AT THE SAME
SPOT IN THE EVENING AND HAD LEFT THEM THIS DISCOURSE BY WAY OF A
FAREWELL I BREAK A CANE OTHERWISE EXPRESSED I CUT MY STICK OR AS
THEY SAY AT THE COURT I FILE OFF
IF YOU DON'T FIND PAPA AND MAMMA
YOUNG 'UNS COME BACK HERE THIS EVENING
I'LL SCRAMBLE YOU UP SOME
SUPPER AND I'LL GIVE YOU A SHAKEDOWN THE TWO CHILDREN PICKED UP BY
SOME POLICEMAN AND PLACED IN THE REFUGE OR STOLEN BY SOME MOUNTEBANK
OR HAVING SIMPLY STRAYED OFF IN THAT IMMENSE CHINESE PUZZLE OF A PARIS
DID NOT RETURN
THE LOWEST DEPTHS OF THE ACTUAL SOCIAL WORLD ARE FULL OF
THESE LOST TRACES
GAVROCHE DID NOT SEE THEM AGAIN
TEN OR TWELVE WEEKS
HAD ELAPSED SINCE THAT NIGHT
MORE THAN ONCE HE HAD SCRATCHED THE BACK
OF HIS HEAD AND SAID WHERE THE DEVIL ARE MY TWO CHILDREN
IN THE MEANTIME HE HAD ARRIVED PISTOL IN HAND IN THE RUE DU
PONT AUX CHOUX
HE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS BUT ONE SHOP OPEN IN THAT
STREET AND A MATTER WORTHY OF REFLECTION THAT WAS A PASTRY COOK'S
SHOP
THIS PRESENTED A PROVIDENTIAL OCCASION TO EAT ANOTHER
APPLE TURNOVER BEFORE ENTERING THE UNKNOWN
GAVROCHE HALTED FUMBLED IN
HIS FOB TURNED HIS POCKET INSIDE OUT FOUND NOTHING NOT EVEN A SOU
AND BEGAN TO SHOUT HELP
IT IS HARD TO MISS THE LAST CAKE
NEVERTHELESS GAVROCHE PURSUED HIS WAY
TWO MINUTES LATER HE WAS IN THE RUE SAINT LOUIS
WHILE TRAVERSING THE
RUE DU PARC ROYAL HE FELT CALLED UPON TO MAKE GOOD THE LOSS OF THE
APPLE TURNOVER WHICH HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE AND HE INDULGED HIMSELF IN THE
IMMENSE DELIGHT OF TEARING DOWN THE THEATRE POSTERS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
A LITTLE FURTHER ON ON CATCHING SIGHT OF A GROUP OF COMFORTABLE LOOKING
PERSONS WHO SEEMED TO BE LANDED PROPRIETORS HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
AND SPIT OUT AT RANDOM BEFORE HIM THIS MOUTHFUL OF PHILOSOPHICAL BILE AS
THEY PASSED
HOW FAT THOSE MONEYED MEN ARE THEY'RE DRUNK THEY JUST WALLOW IN GOOD
DINNERS
ASK 'EM WHAT THEY DO WITH THEIR MONEY
THEY DON'T KNOW
THEY
EAT IT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO AS MUCH AS THEIR BELLIES WILL HOLD
CHAPTER II GAVROCHE ON THE MARCH
THE BRANDISHING OF A TRIGGERLESS PISTOL GRASPED IN ONE'S HAND IN THE
OPEN STREET IS SO MUCH OF A PUBLIC FUNCTION THAT GAVROCHE FELT HIS
FERVOR INCREASING WITH EVERY MOMENT
AMID THE SCRAPS OF THE MARSEILLAISE
WHICH HE WAS SINGING HE SHOUTED
ALL GOES WELL
I SUFFER A GREAT DEAL IN MY LEFT PAW I'M ALL BROKEN
UP WITH RHEUMATISM BUT I'M SATISFIED CITIZENS
ALL THAT THE BOURGEOIS
HAVE TO DO IS TO BEAR THEMSELVES WELL I'LL SNEEZE THEM OUT SUBVERSIVE
COUPLETS
WHAT ARE THE POLICE SPIES DOGS
AND I'D JUST LIKE TO HAVE
ONE OF THEM AT THE END OF MY PISTOL
I'M JUST FROM THE BOULEVARD MY
FRIENDS
IT'S GETTING HOT THERE IT'S GETTING INTO A LITTLE BOIL IT'S
SIMMERING
IT'S TIME TO SKIM THE POT
FORWARD MARCH MEN LET AN IMPURE
BLOOD INUNDATE THE FURROWS I GIVE MY DAYS TO MY COUNTRY I SHALL NEVER
SEE MY CONCUBINE MORE NINI FINISHED YES NINI BUT NEVER MIND LONG
LIVE JOY LET'S FIGHT CREBLEU I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF DESPOTISM
AT THAT MOMENT THE HORSE OF A LANCER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD HAVING
FALLEN GAVROCHE LAID HIS PISTOL ON THE PAVEMENT AND PICKED UP THE
MAN THEN HE ASSISTED IN RAISING THE HORSE
AFTER WHICH HE PICKED UP HIS
PISTOL AND RESUMED HIS WAY
IN THE RUE DE THORIGNY ALL WAS PEACE AND
SILENCE
THIS APATHY PECULIAR TO THE MARAIS PRESENTED A CONTRAST WITH
THE VAST SURROUNDING UPROAR
FOUR GOSSIPS WERE CHATTING IN A DOORWAY
SCOTLAND HAS TRIOS OF WITCHES PARIS HAS QUARTETTES OF OLD GOSSIPING
HAGS AND THE THOU SHALT BE KING COULD BE QUITE AS MOURNFULLY HURLED
AT BONAPARTE IN THE CARREFOUR BAUDOYER AS AT MACBETH ON THE HEATH OF
ARMUYR
THE CROAK WOULD BE ALMOST IDENTICAL
THE GOSSIPS OF THE RUE DE THORIGNY BUSIED THEMSELVES ONLY WITH THEIR OWN
CONCERNS
THREE OF THEM WERE PORTRESSES AND THE FOURTH WAS A RAG PICKER
WITH HER BASKET ON HER BACK
ALL FOUR OF THEM SEEMED TO BE STANDING AT THE FOUR CORNERS OF OLD AGE
WHICH ARE DECREPITUDE DECAY RUIN AND SADNESS
THE RAG PICKER WAS HUMBLE
IN THIS OPEN AIR SOCIETY IT IS THE
RAG PICKER WHO SALUTES AND THE PORTRESS WHO PATRONIZES
THIS IS CAUSED
BY THE CORNER FOR REFUSE WHICH IS FAT OR LEAN ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF
THE PORTRESSES AND AFTER THE FANCY OF THE ONE WHO MAKES THE HEAP
THERE
MAY BE KINDNESS IN THE BROOM
THIS RAG PICKER WAS A GRATEFUL CREATURE AND SHE SMILED WITH WHAT A
SMILE ON THE THREE PORTRESSES
THINGS OF THIS NATURE WERE SAID
AH BY THE WAY IS YOUR CAT STILL CROSS
GOOD GRACIOUS CATS ARE NATURALLY THE ENEMIES OF DOGS YOU KNOW
IT'S
THE DOGS WHO COMPLAIN
AND PEOPLE ALSO
BUT THE FLEAS FROM A CAT DON'T GO AFTER PEOPLE
THAT'S NOT THE TROUBLE DOGS ARE DANGEROUS
I REMEMBER ONE YEAR
WHEN THERE WERE SO MANY DOGS THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO PUT IT IN THE
NEWSPAPERS
THAT WAS AT THE TIME WHEN THERE WERE AT THE TUILERIES GREAT
SHEEP THAT DREW THE LITTLE CARRIAGE OF THE KING OF ROME
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE KING OF ROME
I LIKED THE DUC DE BORDEAU BETTER
I KNEW LOUIS XVIII
I PREFER LOUIS XVIII
MEAT IS AWFULLY DEAR ISN'T IT MOTHER PATAGON
AH DON'T MENTION IT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP IS A HORROR
A HORRIBLE
HORROR ONE CAN'T AFFORD ANYTHING BUT THE POOR CUTS NOWADAYS
HERE THE RAG PICKER INTERPOSED
LADIES BUSINESS IS DULL
THE REFUSE HEAPS ARE MISERABLE
NO ONE THROWS
ANYTHING AWAY ANY MORE
THEY EAT EVERYTHING
THERE ARE POORER PEOPLE THAN YOU LA VARGOULEME
AH THAT'S TRUE REPLIED THE RAG PICKER WITH DEFERENCE I HAVE A
PROFESSION
A PAUSE SUCCEEDED AND THE RAG PICKER YIELDING TO THAT NECESSITY FOR
BOASTING WHICH LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF MAN ADDED
IN THE MORNING ON MY RETURN HOME I PICK OVER MY BASKET I SORT MY
THINGS
THIS MAKES HEAPS IN MY ROOM
I PUT THE RAGS IN A BASKET THE
CORES AND STALKS IN A BUCKET THE LINEN IN MY CUPBOARD THE WOOLLEN
STUFF IN MY COMMODE THE OLD PAPERS IN THE CORNER OF THE WINDOW
THE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD TO EAT IN MY BOWL THE BITS OF GLASS IN MY
FIREPLACE THE OLD SHOES BEHIND MY DOOR AND THE BONES UNDER MY BED
GAVROCHE HAD STOPPED BEHIND HER AND WAS LISTENING
OLD LADIES SAID HE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY TALKING POLITICS
HE WAS ASSAILED BY A BROADSIDE COMPOSED OF A QUADRUPLE HOWL
HERE'S ANOTHER RASCAL
WHAT'S THAT HE'S GOT IN HIS PADDLE A PISTOL
WELL I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF A BEGGAR'S BRAT THIS IS
THAT SORT OF ANIMAL IS NEVER EASY UNLESS HE'S OVERTURNING THE
AUTHORITIES
GAVROCHE DISDAINFULLY CONTENTED HIMSELF BY WAY OF REPRISAL WITH
ELEVATING THE TIP OF HIS NOSE WITH HIS THUMB AND OPENING HIS HAND WIDE
THE RAG PICKER CRIED
YOU MALICIOUS BARE PAWED LITTLE WRETCH
THE ONE WHO ANSWERED TO THE NAME OF PATAGON CLAPPED HER HANDS TOGETHER
IN HORROR
THERE'S GOING TO BE EVIL DOINGS THAT'S CERTAIN
THE ERRAND BOY NEXT
DOOR HAS A LITTLE POINTED BEARD I HAVE SEEN HIM PASS EVERY DAY WITH A
YOUNG PERSON IN A PINK BONNET ON HIS ARM TO DAY I SAW HIM PASS AND
HE HAD A GUN ON HIS ARM
MAME BACHEUX SAYS THAT LAST WEEK THERE WAS A
REVOLUTION AT AT AT WHERE'S THE CALF AT PONTOISE
AND THEN THERE
YOU SEE HIM THAT HORRID SCAMP WITH HIS PISTOL IT SEEMS THAT THE
CELESTINS ARE FULL OF PISTOLS
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THE GOVERNMENT CAN
DO WITH GOOD FOR NOTHINGS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING BUT CONTRIVE
WAYS OF UPSETTING THE WORLD WHEN WE HAD JUST BEGUN TO GET A LITTLE
QUIET AFTER ALL THE MISFORTUNES THAT HAVE HAPPENED GOOD LORD TO THAT
POOR QUEEN WHOM I SAW PASS IN THE TUMBRIL AND ALL THIS IS GOING TO
MAKE TOBACCO DEARER
IT'S INFAMOUS AND I SHALL CERTAINLY GO TO SEE HIM
BEHEADED ON THE GUILLOTINE THE WRETCH
YOU'VE GOT THE SNIFFLES OLD LADY SAID GAVROCHE
BLOW YOUR
PROMONTORY
AND HE PASSED ON
WHEN HE WAS IN THE RUE PAVEE THE RAG PICKER OCCURRED
TO HIS MIND AND HE INDULGED IN THIS SOLILOQUY
YOU'RE IN THE WRONG TO INSULT THE REVOLUTIONISTS MOTHER
DUST HEAP CORNER
THIS PISTOL IS IN YOUR INTERESTS
IT'S SO THAT YOU MAY
HAVE MORE GOOD THINGS TO EAT IN YOUR BASKET
ALL AT ONCE HE HEARD A SHOUT BEHIND HIM IT WAS THE PORTRESS PATAGON
WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM AND WHO WAS SHAKING HER FIST AT HIM IN THE
DISTANCE AND CRYING
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A BASTARD
OH COME NOW SAID GAVROCHE I DON'T CARE A BRASS FARTHING FOR THAT
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HE PASSED THE HOTEL LAMOIGNON
THERE HE UTTERED THIS
APPEAL
FORWARD MARCH TO THE BATTLE
AND HE WAS SEIZED WITH A FIT OF MELANCHOLY
HE GAZED AT HIS PISTOL WITH
AN AIR OF REPROACH WHICH SEEMED AN ATTEMPT TO APPEASE IT
I'M GOING OFF SAID HE BUT YOU WON'T GO OFF
ONE DOG MAY DISTRACT THE ATTENTION FROM ANOTHER DOG 45 A VERY GAUNT
POODLE CAME ALONG AT THE MOMENT
GAVROCHE FELT COMPASSION FOR HIM
MY POOR DOGGY SAID HE YOU MUST HAVE GONE AND SWALLOWED A CASK FOR
ALL THE HOOPS ARE VISIBLE
THEN HE DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARDS L'ORME SAINT GERVAIS
CHAPTER III JUST INDIGNATION OF A HAIR DRESSER
THE WORTHY HAIR DRESSER WHO HAD CHASED FROM HIS SHOP THE TWO LITTLE
FELLOWS TO WHOM GAVROCHE HAD OPENED THE PATERNAL INTERIOR OF THE
ELEPHANT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS SHOP ENGAGED IN SHAVING AN OLD
SOLDIER OF THE LEGION WHO HAD SERVED UNDER THE EMPIRE
THEY WERE
TALKING
THE HAIR DRESSER HAD NATURALLY SPOKEN TO THE VETERAN OF THE
RIOT THEN OF GENERAL LAMARQUE AND FROM LAMARQUE THEY HAD PASSED TO
THE EMPEROR
THENCE SPRANG UP A CONVERSATION BETWEEN BARBER AND
SOLDIER WHICH PRUDHOMME HAD HE BEEN PRESENT WOULD HAVE ENRICHED WITH
ARABESQUES AND WHICH HE WOULD HAVE ENTITLED DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE
RAZOR AND THE SWORD
HOW DID THE EMPEROR RIDE SIR SAID THE BARBER
BADLY
HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FALL SO HE NEVER FELL
DID HE HAVE FINE HORSES HE MUST HAVE HAD FINE HORSES
ON THE DAY WHEN HE GAVE ME MY CROSS I NOTICED HIS BEAST
IT WAS A
RACING MARE PERFECTLY WHITE
HER EARS WERE VERY WIDE APART HER SADDLE
DEEP A FINE HEAD MARKED WITH A BLACK STAR A VERY LONG NECK STRONGLY
ARTICULATED KNEES PROMINENT RIBS OBLIQUE SHOULDERS AND A POWERFUL
CRUPPER
A LITTLE MORE THAN FIFTEEN HANDS IN HEIGHT
A PRETTY HORSE REMARKED THE HAIR DRESSER
IT WAS HIS MAJESTY'S BEAST
THE HAIR DRESSER FELT THAT AFTER THIS OBSERVATION A SHORT SILENCE
WOULD BE FITTING SO HE CONFORMED HIMSELF TO IT AND THEN WENT ON
THE EMPEROR WAS NEVER WOUNDED BUT ONCE WAS HE SIR
THE OLD SOLDIER REPLIED WITH THE CALM AND SOVEREIGN TONE OF A MAN WHO
HAD BEEN THERE
IN THE HEEL
AT RATISBON
I NEVER SAW HIM SO WELL DRESSED AS ON THAT
DAY
HE WAS AS NEAT AS A NEW SOU
AND YOU MR
VETERAN YOU MUST HAVE BEEN OFTEN WOUNDED
I SAID THE SOLDIER AH NOT TO AMOUNT TO ANYTHING
AT MARENGO I
RECEIVED TWO SABRE BLOWS ON THE BACK OF MY NECK A BULLET IN THE RIGHT
ARM AT AUSTERLITZ ANOTHER IN THE LEFT HIP AT JENA
AT FRIEDLAND
A THRUST FROM A BAYONET THERE AT THE MOSKOWA SEVEN OR EIGHT
LANCE THRUSTS NO MATTER WHERE AT LUTZEN A SPLINTER OF A SHELL CRUSHED
ONE OF MY FINGERS
AH AND THEN AT WATERLOO A BALL FROM A BISCAIEN IN
THE THIGH THAT'S ALL
HOW FINE THAT IS EXCLAIMED THE HAIR DRESSER IN PINDARIC ACCENTS TO
DIE ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE ON MY WORD OF HONOR RATHER THAN DIE IN BED
OF AN ILLNESS SLOWLY A BIT BY BIT EACH DAY WITH DRUGS CATAPLASMS
SYRINGES MEDICINES I SHOULD PREFER TO RECEIVE A CANNON BALL IN MY
BELLY
YOU'RE NOT OVER FASTIDIOUS SAID THE SOLDIER
HE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN WHEN A FEARFUL CRASH SHOOK THE SHOP
THE
SHOW WINDOW HAD SUDDENLY BEEN FRACTURED
THE WIG MAKER TURNED PALE
AH GOOD GOD HE EXCLAIMED IT'S ONE OF THEM
WHAT
A CANNON BALL
HERE IT IS SAID THE SOLDIER
AND HE PICKED UP SOMETHING THAT WAS ROLLING ABOUT THE FLOOR
IT WAS A
PEBBLE
THE HAIR DRESSER RAN TO THE BROKEN WINDOW AND BEHELD GAVROCHE FLEEING
AT THE FULL SPEED TOWARDS THE MARCHE SAINT JEAN
AS HE PASSED THE
HAIR DRESSER'S SHOP GAVROCHE WHO HAD THE TWO BRATS STILL IN HIS MIND
HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THE IMPULSE TO SAY GOOD DAY TO HIM AND HAD
FLUNG A STONE THROUGH HIS PANES
YOU SEE SHRIEKED THE HAIR DRESSER WHO FROM WHITE HAD TURNED BLUE
THAT FELLOW RETURNS AND DOES MISCHIEF FOR THE PURE PLEASURE OF IT
WHAT
HAS ANY ONE DONE TO THAT GAMIN
CHAPTER IV THE CHILD IS AMAZED AT THE OLD MAN
IN THE MEANTIME IN THE MARCHE SAINT JEAN WHERE THE POST HAD ALREADY
BEEN DISARMED GAVROCHE HAD JUST EFFECTED A JUNCTION WITH A BAND LED
BY ENJOLRAS COURFEYRAC COMBEFERRE AND FEUILLY
THEY WERE ARMED AFTER
A FASHION
BAHOREL AND JEAN PROUVAIRE HAD FOUND THEM AND SWELLED THE
GROUP
ENJOLRAS HAD A DOUBLE BARRELLED HUNTING GUN COMBEFERRE THE GUN
OF A NATIONAL GUARD BEARING THE NUMBER OF HIS LEGION AND IN HIS BELT
TWO PISTOLS WHICH HIS UNBUTTONED COAT ALLOWED TO BE SEEN JEAN PROUVAIRE
AN OLD CAVALRY MUSKET BAHOREL A RIFLE COURFEYRAC WAS BRANDISHING AN
UNSHEATHED SWORD CANE
FEUILLY WITH A NAKED SWORD IN HIS HAND MARCHED
AT THEIR HEAD SHOUTING LONG LIVE POLAND
THEY REACHED THE QUAI MORLAND
CRAVATLESS HATLESS BREATHLESS SOAKED
BY THE RAIN WITH LIGHTNING IN THEIR EYES
GAVROCHE ACCOSTED THEM
CALMLY
WHERE ARE WE GOING
COME ALONG SAID COURFEYRAC
BEHIND FEUILLY MARCHED OR RATHER BOUNDED BAHOREL WHO WAS LIKE A FISH
IN WATER IN A RIOT
HE WORE A SCARLET WAISTCOAT AND INDULGED IN
THE SORT OF WORDS WHICH BREAK EVERYTHING
HIS WAISTCOAT ASTOUNDED A
PASSER BY WHO CRIED IN BEWILDERMENT
HERE ARE THE REDS
THE REDS THE REDS RETORTED BAHOREL
A QUEER KIND OF FEAR
BOURGEOIS
FOR MY PART I DON'T TREMBLE BEFORE A POPPY THE LITTLE RED
HAT INSPIRES ME WITH NO ALARM
TAKE MY ADVICE BOURGEOIS LET'S LEAVE
FEAR OF THE RED TO HORNED CATTLE
HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CORNER OF THE WALL ON WHICH WAS PLACARDED THE
MOST PEACEABLE SHEET OF PAPER IN THE WORLD A PERMISSION TO EAT EGGS A
LENTEN ADMONITION ADDRESSED BY THE ARCHBISHOP OF PARIS TO HIS FLOCK
BAHOREL EXCLAIMED
'FLOCK' A POLITE WAY OF SAYING GEESE
AND HE TORE THE CHARGE FROM THE NAIL
THIS CONQUERED GAVROCHE
FROM THAT
INSTANT GAVROCHE SET HIMSELF TO STUDY BAHOREL
BAHOREL OBSERVED ENJOLRAS YOU ARE WRONG
YOU SHOULD HAVE LET THAT
CHARGE ALONE HE IS NOT THE PERSON WITH WHOM WE HAVE TO DEAL YOU ARE
WASTING YOUR WRATH TO NO PURPOSE
TAKE CARE OF YOUR SUPPLY
ONE DOES NOT
FIRE OUT OF THE RANKS WITH THE SOUL ANY MORE THAN WITH A GUN
EACH ONE IN HIS OWN FASHION ENJOLRAS RETORTED BAHOREL
THIS
BISHOP'S PROSE SHOCKS ME I WANT TO EAT EGGS WITHOUT BEING PERMITTED
YOUR STYLE IS THE HOT AND COLD I AM AMUSING MYSELF
BESIDES I'M NOT
WASTING MYSELF I'M GETTING A START AND IF I TORE DOWN THAT CHARGE
HERCLE 'TWAS ONLY TO WHET MY APPETITE
THIS WORD HERCLE STRUCK GAVROCHE
HE SOUGHT ALL OCCASIONS FOR
LEARNING AND THAT TEARER DOWN OF POSTERS POSSESSED HIS ESTEEM
HE
INQUIRED OF HIM
WHAT DOES HERCLE MEAN
BAHOREL ANSWERED
IT MEANS CURSED NAME OF A DOG IN LATIN
HERE BAHOREL RECOGNIZED AT A WINDOW A PALE YOUNG MAN WITH A BLACK BEARD
WHO WAS WATCHING THEM AS THEY PASSED PROBABLY A FRIEND OF THE A B C
HE
SHOUTED TO HIM
QUICK CARTRIDGES PARA BELLUM
A FINE MAN THAT'S TRUE SAID GAVROCHE WHO NOW UNDERSTOOD LATIN
A TUMULTUOUS RETINUE ACCOMPANIED THEM STUDENTS ARTISTS YOUNG MEN
AFFILIATED TO THE COUGOURDE OF AIX ARTISANS LONGSHOREMEN ARMED WITH
CLUBS AND BAYONETS SOME LIKE COMBEFERRE WITH PISTOLS THRUST INTO
THEIR TROUSERS
AN OLD MAN WHO APPEARED TO BE EXTREMELY AGED WAS WALKING IN THE BAND
HE HAD NO ARMS AND HE MADE GREAT HASTE SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE LEFT
BEHIND ALTHOUGH HE HAD A THOUGHTFUL AIR
GAVROCHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
KEKSEKCA SAID HE TO COURFEYRAC
HE'S AN OLD DUFFER
IT WAS M
MABEUF
CHAPTER V THE OLD MAN
LET US RECOUNT WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
ENJOLRAS AND HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN ON THE BOULEVARD BOURDON NEAR THE
PUBLIC STOREHOUSES AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE DRAGOONS HAD MADE THEIR
CHARGE
ENJOLRAS COURFEYRAC AND COMBEFERRE WERE AMONG THOSE WHO HAD
TAKEN TO THE RUE BASSOMPIERRE SHOUTING TO THE BARRICADES IN THE RUE
LESDIGUIERES THEY HAD MET AN OLD MAN WALKING ALONG
WHAT HAD ATTRACTED
THEIR ATTENTION WAS THAT THE GOODMAN WAS WALKING IN A ZIG ZAG AS THOUGH
HE WERE INTOXICATED
MOREOVER HE HAD HIS HAT IN HIS HAND ALTHOUGH IT
HAD BEEN RAINING ALL THE MORNING AND WAS RAINING PRETTY BRISKLY AT THE
VERY TIME
COURFEYRAC HAD RECOGNIZED FATHER MABEUF
HE KNEW HIM THROUGH
HAVING MANY TIMES ACCOMPANIED MARIUS AS FAR AS HIS DOOR
AS HE WAS
ACQUAINTED WITH THE PEACEFUL AND MORE THAN TIMID HABITS OF THE OLD
BEADLE BOOK COLLECTOR AND WAS AMAZED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM IN THE MIDST
OF THAT UPROAR A COUPLE OF PACES FROM THE CAVALRY CHARGES ALMOST IN
THE MIDST OF A FUSILLADE HATLESS IN THE RAIN AND STROLLING ABOUT AMONG
THE BULLETS HE HAD ACCOSTED HIM AND THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE HAD BEEN
EXCHANGED BETWEEN THE RIOTER OF FIRE AND THE OCTOGENARIAN
M
MABEUF GO TO YOUR HOME
WHY
THERE'S GOING TO BE A ROW
THAT'S WELL
THRUSTS WITH THE SWORD AND FIRING M
MABEUF
THAT IS WELL
FIRING FROM CANNON
THAT IS GOOD
WHERE ARE THE REST OF YOU GOING
WE ARE GOING TO FLING THE GOVERNMENT TO THE EARTH
THAT IS GOOD
AND HE HAD SET OUT TO FOLLOW THEM
FROM THAT MOMENT FORTH HE HAD NOT
UTTERED A WORD
HIS STEP HAD SUDDENLY BECOME FIRM ARTISANS HAD OFFERED
HIM THEIR ARMS HE HAD REFUSED WITH A SIGN OF THE HEAD
HE ADVANCED
NEARLY TO THE FRONT RANK OF THE COLUMN WITH THE MOVEMENT OF A MAN WHO
IS MARCHING AND THE COUNTENANCE OF A MAN WHO IS SLEEPING
WHAT A FIERCE OLD FELLOW MUTTERED THE STUDENTS
THE RUMOR SPREAD
THROUGH THE TROOP THAT HE WAS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION AN OLD
REGICIDE
THE MOB HAD TURNED IN THROUGH THE RUE DE LA VERRERIE
LITTLE GAVROCHE MARCHED IN FRONT WITH THAT DEAFENING SONG WHICH MADE OF
HIM A SORT OF TRUMPET
HE SANG VOICI LA LUNE QUI PARATT
QUAND IRONS NOUS DANS LA FORET
DEMANDAIT CHARLOT A CHARLOTTE
TOU TOU TOU
POUR CHATOU
JE N'AI QU'UN DIEU QU'UN ROI QU'UN LIARD ET QU'UNE BOTTE
POUR AVOIR BU DE GRAND MATIN
LA ROSEE A MEME LE THYM
DEUX MOINEAUX ETAIENT EN RIBOTTE
ZI ZI ZI
POUR PASSY
JE N'AI QU'UN DIEU QU'UN ROI QU'UN LIARD ET QU'UNE BOTTE
ET CES DEUX PAUVRES PETITS LOUPS
COMME DEUX GRIVES ESTAIENT SOULS
UNE TIGRE EN RIAIT DANS SA GROTTE
DON DON DON
POUR MEUDON
JE N'AI QU'UN DIEU QU'UN ROI QU'UN LIARD ET QU'UNE BOTTE
L'UN JURAIT ET L'AUTRE SACRAIT
QUAND IRONS NOUS DANS LA FORET
DEMANDAIT CHARLOT A CHARLOTTE
TIN TIN TIN
POUR PANTIN
JE N'AI QU'UN DIEU QU'UN ROI QU'UN LIARD ET QU'UNE BOTTE 46
THEY DIRECTED THEIR COURSE TOWARDS SAINT MERRY
CHAPTER VI RECRUITS
THE BAND AUGMENTED EVERY MOMENT
NEAR THE RUE DES BILLETTES A MAN OF
LOFTY STATURE WHOSE HAIR WAS TURNING GRAY AND WHOSE BOLD AND DARING
MIEN WAS REMARKED BY COURFEYRAC ENJOLRAS AND COMBEFERRE BUT WHOM
NONE OF THEM KNEW JOINED THEM
GAVROCHE WHO WAS OCCUPIED IN SINGING
WHISTLING HUMMING RUNNING ON AHEAD AND POUNDING ON THE SHUTTERS OF THE
SHOPS WITH THE BUTT OF HIS TRIGGERLESS PISTOL PAID NO ATTENTION TO THIS
MAN
IT CHANCED THAT IN THE RUE DE LA VERRERIE THEY PASSED IN FRONT OF
COURFEYRAC'S DOOR
THIS HAPPENS JUST RIGHT SAID COURFEYRAC I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY PURSE
AND I HAVE LOST MY HAT
HE QUITTED THE MOB AND RAN UP TO HIS QUARTERS AT FULL SPEED
HE SEIZED
AN OLD HAT AND HIS PURSE
HE ALSO SEIZED A LARGE SQUARE COFFER OF THE DIMENSIONS OF A LARGE
VALISE WHICH WAS CONCEALED UNDER HIS SOILED LINEN
AS HE DESCENDED AGAIN AT A RUN THE PORTRESS HAILED HIM
MONSIEUR DE COURFEYRAC
WHAT'S YOUR NAME PORTRESS
THE PORTRESS STOOD BEWILDERED
WHY YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL I'M THE CONCIERGE MY NAME IS MOTHER
VEUVAIN
WELL IF YOU CALL ME MONSIEUR DE COURFEYRAC AGAIN I SHALL CALL YOU
MOTHER DE VEUVAIN
NOW SPEAK WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT DO YOU WANT
THERE IS SOME ONE WHO WANTS TO SPEAK WITH YOU
WHO IS IT
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE IS HE
IN MY LODGE
THE DEVIL EJACULATED COURFEYRAC
BUT THE PERSON HAS BEEN WAITING YOUR RETURN FOR OVER AN HOUR SAID THE
PORTRESS
AT THE SAME TIME A SORT OF PALE THIN SMALL FRECKLED AND YOUTHFUL
ARTISAN CLAD IN A TATTERED BLOUSE AND PATCHED TROUSERS OF RIBBED
VELVET AND WHO HAD RATHER THE AIR OF A GIRL ACCOUTRED AS A MAN THAN OF
A MAN EMERGED FROM THE LODGE AND SAID TO COURFEYRAC IN A VOICE WHICH
WAS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD LIKE A WOMAN'S VOICE
MONSIEUR MARIUS IF YOU PLEASE
HE IS NOT HERE
WILL HE RETURN THIS EVENING
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
AND COURFEYRAC ADDED
FOR MY PART I SHALL NOT RETURN
THE YOUNG MAN GAZED STEADILY AT HIM AND SAID
WHY NOT
BECAUSE
WHERE ARE YOU GOING THEN
WHAT BUSINESS IS THAT OF YOURS
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME CARRY YOUR COFFER FOR YOU
I AM GOING TO THE BARRICADES
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME GO WITH YOU
IF YOU LIKE REPLIED COURFEYRAC
THE STREET IS FREE THE PAVEMENTS
BELONG TO EVERY ONE
AND HE MADE HIS ESCAPE AT A RUN TO JOIN HIS FRIENDS
WHEN HE HAD
REJOINED THEM HE GAVE THE COFFER TO ONE OF THEM TO CARRY
IT WAS ONLY
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTER THIS THAT HE SAW THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD
ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THEM
A MOB DOES NOT GO PRECISELY WHERE IT INTENDS
WE HAVE EXPLAINED THAT
A GUST OF WIND CARRIES IT AWAY
THEY OVERSHOT SAINT MERRY AND FOUND
THEMSELVES WITHOUT PRECISELY KNOWING HOW IN THE RUE SAINT DENIS
BOOK TWELFTH CORINTHE
CHAPTER I HISTORY OF CORINTHE FROM ITS FOUNDATION
THE PARISIANS WHO NOWADAYS ON ENTERING ON THE RUE RAMBUTEAU AT THE END
NEAR THE HALLES NOTICE ON THEIR RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RUE MONDETOUR A
BASKET MAKER'S SHOP HAVING FOR ITS SIGN A BASKET IN THE FORM OF NAPOLEON
THE GREAT WITH THIS INSCRIPTION
NAPOLEON IS MADE
WHOLLY OF WILLOW
HAVE NO SUSPICION OF THE TERRIBLE SCENES WHICH THIS VERY SPOT WITNESSED
HARDLY THIRTY YEARS AGO
IT WAS THERE THAT LAY THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE WHICH ANCIENT DEEDS
SPELL CHANVERRERIE AND THE CELEBRATED PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED CORINTHE
THE READER WILL REMEMBER ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE BARRICADE
EFFECTED AT THIS POINT AND ECLIPSED BY THE WAY BY THE BARRICADE
SAINT MERRY
IT WAS ON THIS FAMOUS BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE LA
CHANVRERIE NOW FALLEN INTO PROFOUND OBSCURITY THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO
SHED A LITTLE LIGHT
MAY WE BE PERMITTED TO RECUR FOR THE SAKE OF CLEARNESS IN THE RECITAL
TO THE SIMPLE MEANS WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY EMPLOYED IN THE CASE OF
WATERLOO
PERSONS WHO WISH TO PICTURE TO THEMSELVES IN A TOLERABLY EXACT
MANNER THE CONSTITUTION OF THE HOUSES WHICH STOOD AT THAT EPOCH NEAR THE
POINTE SAINT EUSTACHE AT THE NORTHEAST ANGLE OF THE HALLES OF PARIS
WHERE TO DAY LIES THE EMBOUCHURE OF THE RUE RAMBUTEAU HAVE ONLY TO
IMAGINE AN N TOUCHING THE RUE SAINT DENIS WITH ITS SUMMIT AND THE HALLES
WITH ITS BASE AND WHOSE TWO VERTICAL BARS SHOULD FORM THE RUE DE LA
GRANDE TRUANDERIE AND THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE AND WHOSE TRANSVERSE
BAR SHOULD BE FORMED BY THE RUE DE LA PETITE TRUANDERIE
THE OLD RUE
MONDETOUR CUT THE THREE STROKES OF THE N AT THE MOST CROOKED ANGLES
SO THAT THE LABYRINTHINE CONFUSION OF THESE FOUR STREETS SUFFICED TO
FORM ON A SPACE THREE FATHOMS SQUARE BETWEEN THE HALLES AND THE RUE
SAINT DENIS ON THE ONE HAND AND BETWEEN THE RUE DU CYGNE AND THE RUE
DES PRECHEURS ON THE OTHER SEVEN ISLANDS OF HOUSES ODDLY CUT UP OF
VARYING SIZES PLACED CROSSWISE AND HAP HAZARD AND BARELY SEPARATED
LIKE THE BLOCKS OF STONE IN A DOCK BY NARROW CRANNIES
WE SAY NARROW CRANNIES AND WE CAN GIVE NO MORE JUST IDEA OF THOSE DARK
CONTRACTED MANY ANGLED ALLEYS LINED WITH EIGHT STORY BUILDINGS
THESE
BUILDINGS WERE SO DECREPIT THAT IN THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE AND THE RUE
DE LA PETITE TRUANDERIE THE FRONTS WERE SHORED UP WITH BEAMS RUNNING
FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER
THE STREET WAS NARROW AND THE GUTTER BROAD
THE PEDESTRIAN THERE WALKED ON A PAVEMENT THAT WAS ALWAYS WET SKIRTING
LITTLE STALLS RESEMBLING CELLARS BIG POSTS ENCIRCLED WITH IRON HOOPS
EXCESSIVE HEAPS OF REFUSE AND GATES ARMED WITH ENORMOUS CENTURY OLD
GRATINGS
THE RUE RAMBUTEAU HAS DEVASTATED ALL THAT
THE NAME OF MONDETOUR PAINTS MARVELLOUSLY WELL THE SINUOSITIES OF THAT
WHOLE SET OF STREETS
A LITTLE FURTHER ON THEY ARE FOUND STILL BETTER
EXPRESSED BY THE RUE PIROUETTE WHICH RAN INTO THE RUE MONDETOUR
THE PASSER BY WHO GOT ENTANGLED FROM THE RUE SAINT DENIS IN THE RUE DE
LA CHANVRERIE BEHELD IT GRADUALLY CLOSE IN BEFORE HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD
ENTERED AN ELONGATED FUNNEL
AT THE END OF THIS STREET WHICH WAS VERY
SHORT HE FOUND FURTHER PASSAGE BARRED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HALLES
BY A TALL ROW OF HOUSES AND HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF IN A BLIND
ALLEY HAD HE NOT PERCEIVED ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT TWO DARK CUTS THROUGH
WHICH HE COULD MAKE HIS ESCAPE
THIS WAS THE RUE MONDETOUR WHICH ON
ONE SIDE RAN INTO THE RUE DE PRECHEURS AND ON THE OTHER INTO THE RUE
DU CYGNE AND THE PETITE TRUANDERIE
AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS SORT OF
CUL DE SAC AT THE ANGLE OF THE CUTTING ON THE RIGHT THERE WAS TO BE
SEEN A HOUSE WHICH WAS NOT SO TALL AS THE REST AND WHICH FORMED A SORT
OF CAPE IN THE STREET
IT IS IN THIS HOUSE OF TWO STORIES ONLY THAT
AN ILLUSTRIOUS WINE SHOP HAD BEEN MERRILY INSTALLED THREE HUNDRED YEARS
BEFORE
THIS TAVERN CREATED A JOYOUS NOISE IN THE VERY SPOT WHICH OLD
THEOPHILUS DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING COUPLET
LA BRANLE LE SQUELETTE HORRIBLE
D'UN PAUVRE AMANT QUI SE PENDIT 47
THE SITUATION WAS GOOD AND TAVERN KEEPERS SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER THERE
FROM FATHER TO SON
IN THE TIME OF MATHURIN REGNIER THIS CABARET WAS CALLED THE
POT AUX ROSES AND AS THE REBUS WAS THEN IN FASHION IT HAD FOR ITS
SIGN BOARD A POST POTEAU PAINTED ROSE COLOR
IN THE LAST CENTURY THE
WORTHY NATOIRE ONE OF THE FANTASTIC MASTERS NOWADAYS DESPISED BY THE
STIFF SCHOOL HAVING GOT DRUNK MANY TIMES IN THIS WINE SHOP AT THE
VERY TABLE WHERE REGNIER HAD DRUNK HIS FILL HAD PAINTED BY WAY OF
GRATITUDE A BUNCH OF CORINTH GRAPES ON THE PINK POST
THE KEEPER OF THE
CABARET IN HIS JOY HAD CHANGED HIS DEVICE AND HAD CAUSED TO BE PLACED
IN GILT LETTERS BENEATH THE BUNCH THESE WORDS AT THE BUNCH OF CORINTH
GRAPES AU RAISIN DE CORINTHE
HENCE THE NAME OF CORINTHE
NOTHING
IS MORE NATURAL TO DRUNKEN MEN THAN ELLIPSES
THE ELLIPSIS IS THE
ZIG ZAG OF THE PHRASE
CORINTHE GRADUALLY DETHRONED THE POT AUX ROSES
THE LAST PROPRIETOR OF THE DYNASTY FATHER HUCHELOUP NO LONGER
ACQUAINTED EVEN WITH THE TRADITION HAD THE POST PAINTED BLUE
A ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHERE THE BAR WAS SITUATED ONE ON THE FIRST
FLOOR CONTAINING A BILLIARD TABLE A WOODEN SPIRAL STAIRCASE PIERCING
THE CEILING WINE ON THE TABLES SMOKE ON THE WALLS CANDLES IN BROAD
DAYLIGHT THIS WAS THE STYLE OF THIS CABARET
A STAIRCASE WITH A
TRAP DOOR IN THE LOWER ROOM LED TO THE CELLAR
ON THE SECOND FLOOR WERE
THE LODGINGS OF THE HUCHELOUP FAMILY
THEY WERE REACHED BY A STAIRCASE
WHICH WAS A LADDER RATHER THAN A STAIRCASE AND HAD FOR THEIR ENTRANCE
ONLY A PRIVATE DOOR IN THE LARGE ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR
UNDER THE
ROOF IN TWO MANSARD ATTICS WERE THE NESTS FOR THE SERVANTS
THE
KITCHEN SHARED THE GROUND FLOOR WITH THE TAP ROOM
FATHER HUCHELOUP HAD POSSIBLY BEEN BORN A CHEMIST BUT THE FACT IS
THAT HE WAS A COOK PEOPLE DID NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO DRINKING ALONE
IN HIS WINE SHOP THEY ALSO ATE THERE
HUCHELOUP HAD INVENTED A CAPITAL
THING WHICH COULD BE EATEN NOWHERE BUT IN HIS HOUSE STUFFED CARPS
WHICH HE CALLED CARPES AU GRAS
THESE WERE EATEN BY THE LIGHT OF A
TALLOW CANDLE OR OF A LAMP OF THE TIME OF LOUIS XVI ON TABLES TO WHICH
WERE NAILED WAXED CLOTHS IN LIEU OF TABLE CLOTHS
PEOPLE CAME THITHER
FROM A DISTANCE
HUCHELOUP ONE FINE MORNING HAD SEEN FIT TO NOTIFY
PASSERS BY OF THIS SPECIALTY HE HAD DIPPED A BRUSH IN A POT OF BLACK
PAINT AND AS HE WAS AN ORTHOGRAPHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AS WELL AS
A COOK AFTER HIS OWN FASHION HE HAD IMPROVISED ON HIS WALL THIS
REMARKABLE INSCRIPTION
CARPES HO GRAS
ONE WINTER THE RAIN STORMS AND THE SHOWERS HAD TAKEN A FANCY TO
OBLITERATE THE S WHICH TERMINATED THE FIRST WORD AND THE G WHICH BEGAN
THE THIRD THIS IS WHAT REMAINED
CARPE HO RAS
TIME AND RAIN ASSISTING A HUMBLE GASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENT HAD BECOME
A PROFOUND PIECE OF ADVICE
IN THIS WAY IT CAME ABOUT THAT THOUGH HE KNEW NO FRENCH FATHER
HUCHELOUP UNDERSTOOD LATIN THAT HE HAD EVOKED PHILOSOPHY FROM HIS
KITCHEN AND THAT DESIROUS SIMPLY OF EFFACING LENT HE HAD EQUALLED
HORACE
AND THE STRIKING THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THAT ALSO MEANT
ENTER MY WINE SHOP
NOTHING OF ALL THIS IS IN EXISTENCE NOW
THE MONDETOUR LABYRINTH WAS
DISEMBOWELLED AND WIDELY OPENED IN 1847 AND PROBABLY NO LONGER EXISTS
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE AND CORINTHE HAVE
DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE PAVEMENT OF THE RUE RAMBUTEAU
AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID CORINTHE WAS THE MEETING PLACE IF NOT THE
RALLYING POINT OF COURFEYRAC AND HIS FRIENDS
IT WAS GRANTAIRE WHO HAD
DISCOVERED CORINTHE
HE HAD ENTERED IT ON ACCOUNT OF THE CARPE HORAS
AND HAD RETURNED THITHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE CARPES AU GRAS
THERE THEY
DRANK THERE THEY ATE THERE THEY SHOUTED THEY DID NOT PAY MUCH THEY
PAID BADLY THEY DID NOT PAY AT ALL BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS WELCOME
FATHER HUCHELOUP WAS A JOVIAL HOST
HUCHELOUP THAT AMIABLE MAN AS WAS JUST SAID WAS A WINE SHOP KEEPER
WITH A MUSTACHE AN AMUSING VARIETY
HE ALWAYS HAD AN ILL TEMPERED AIR
SEEMED TO WISH TO INTIMIDATE HIS CUSTOMERS GRUMBLED AT THE PEOPLE WHO
ENTERED HIS ESTABLISHMENT AND HAD RATHER THE MIEN OF SEEKING A QUARREL
WITH THEM THAN OF SERVING THEM WITH SOUP
AND YET WE INSIST UPON
THE WORD PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS WELCOME THERE
THIS ODDITY HAD ATTRACTED
CUSTOMERS TO HIS SHOP AND BROUGHT HIM YOUNG MEN WHO SAID TO EACH
OTHER COME HEAR FATHER HUCHELOUP GROWL HE HAD BEEN A FENCING MASTER
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WOULD BURST OUT LAUGHING
A BIG VOICE A GOOD
FELLOW
HE HAD A COMIC FOUNDATION UNDER A TRAGIC EXTERIOR HE ASKED
NOTHING BETTER THAN TO FRIGHTEN YOU VERY MUCH LIKE THOSE SNUFF BOXES
WHICH ARE IN THE SHAPE OF A PISTOL
THE DETONATION MAKES ONE SNEEZE
MOTHER HUCHELOUP HIS WIFE WAS A BEARDED AND A VERY HOMELY CREATURE
ABOUT 1830 FATHER HUCHELOUP DIED
WITH HIM DISAPPEARED THE SECRET OF
STUFFED CARPS
HIS INCONSOLABLE WIDOW CONTINUED TO KEEP THE WINE SHOP
BUT THE COOKING DETERIORATED AND BECAME EXECRABLE THE WINE WHICH HAD
ALWAYS BEEN BAD BECAME FEARFULLY BAD
NEVERTHELESS COURFEYRAC AND HIS
FRIENDS CONTINUED TO GO TO CORINTHE OUT OF PITY AS BOSSUET SAID
THE WIDOW HUCHELOUP WAS BREATHLESS AND MISSHAPEN AND GIVEN TO RUSTIC
RECOLLECTIONS
SHE DEPRIVED THEM OF THEIR FLATNESS BY HER PRONUNCIATION
SHE HAD A WAY OF HER OWN OF SAYING THINGS WHICH SPICED HER
REMINISCENCES OF THE VILLAGE AND OF HER SPRINGTIME
IT HAD FORMERLY BEEN
HER DELIGHT SO SHE AFFIRMED TO HEAR THE LOUPS DE GORGE ROUGES GORGES
CHANTER DANS LES OGREPINES AUBEPINES TO HEAR THE REDBREASTS SING IN
THE HAWTHORN TREES
THE HALL ON THE FIRST FLOOR WHERE THE RESTAURANT WAS SITUATED WAS
A LARGE AND LONG APARTMENT ENCUMBERED WITH STOOLS CHAIRS BENCHES AND
TABLES AND WITH A CRIPPLED LAME OLD BILLIARD TABLE
IT WAS REACHED
BY A SPIRAL STAIRCASE WHICH TERMINATED IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM AT A
SQUARE HOLE LIKE THE HATCHWAY OF A SHIP
THIS ROOM LIGHTED BY A SINGLE NARROW WINDOW AND BY A LAMP THAT WAS
ALWAYS BURNING HAD THE AIR OF A GARRET
ALL THE FOUR FOOTED FURNITURE
COMPORTED ITSELF AS THOUGH IT HAD BUT THREE LEGS THE WHITEWASHED WALLS
HAD FOR THEIR ONLY ORNAMENT THE FOLLOWING QUATRAIN IN HONOR OF MAME
HUCHELOUP
ELLE ETONNE A DIX PAS ELLE EPOUVENTE A DEUX
UNE VERRUE HABITE EN SON NEZ HASARDEUX
ON TREMBLE A CHAQUE INSTANT QU'ELLE NE VOUS LA MOUCHE
ET QU'UN BEAU JOUR SON NEZ NE TOMBE DANS SA BOUCHE 48
THIS WAS SCRAWLED IN CHARCOAL ON THE WALL
MAME HUCHELOUP A GOOD LIKENESS WENT AND CAME FROM MORNING TILL
NIGHT BEFORE THIS QUATRAIN WITH THE MOST PERFECT TRANQUILLITY
TWO
SERVING MAIDS NAMED MATELOTE AND GIBELOTTE 49 AND WHO HAD NEVER BEEN
KNOWN BY ANY OTHER NAMES HELPED MAME HUCHELOUP TO SET ON THE TABLES
THE JUGS OF POOR WINE AND THE VARIOUS BROTHS WHICH WERE SERVED TO THE
HUNGRY PATRONS IN EARTHENWARE BOWLS
MATELOTE LARGE PLUMP REDHAIRED
AND NOISY THE FAVORITE EX SULTANA OF THE DEFUNCT HUCHELOUP WAS
HOMELIER THAN ANY MYTHOLOGICAL MONSTER BE IT WHAT IT MAY STILL AS IT
BECOMES THE SERVANT TO ALWAYS KEEP IN THE REAR OF THE MISTRESS SHE WAS
LESS HOMELY THAN MAME HUCHELOUP
GIBELOTTE TALL DELICATE WHITE WITH A
LYMPHATIC PALLOR WITH CIRCLES ROUND HER EYES AND DROOPING LIDS ALWAYS
LANGUID AND WEARY AFFLICTED WITH WHAT MAY BE CALLED CHRONIC LASSITUDE
THE FIRST UP IN THE HOUSE AND THE LAST IN BED WAITED ON EVERY ONE EVEN
THE OTHER MAID SILENTLY AND GENTLY SMILING THROUGH HER FATIGUE WITH A
VAGUE AND SLEEPY SMILE
BEFORE ENTERING THE RESTAURANT ROOM THE VISITOR READ ON THE DOOR THE
FOLLOWING LINE WRITTEN THERE IN CHALK BY COURFEYRAC
REGALE SI TU PEUX ET MANGE SI TU L'OSES 50
CHAPTER II PRELIMINARY GAYETIES
LAIGLE DE MEAUX AS THE READER KNOWS LIVED MORE WITH JOLY THAN
ELSEWHERE
HE HAD A LODGING AS A BIRD HAS ONE ON A BRANCH
THE
TWO FRIENDS LIVED TOGETHER ATE TOGETHER SLEPT TOGETHER
THEY HAD
EVERYTHING IN COMMON EVEN MUSICHETTA TO SOME EXTENT
THEY WERE WHAT
THE SUBORDINATE MONKS WHO ACCOMPANY MONKS ARE CALLED BINI
ON THE
MORNING OF THE 5TH OF JUNE THEY WENT TO CORINTHE TO BREAKFAST
JOLY
WHO WAS ALL STUFFED UP HAD A CATARRH WHICH LAIGLE WAS BEGINNING TO
SHARE
LAIGLE'S COAT WAS THREADBARE BUT JOLY WAS WELL DRESSED
IT WAS ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY OPENED THE DOOR OF
CORINTHE
THEY ASCENDED TO THE FIRST FLOOR
MATELOTE AND GIBELOTTE RECEIVED THEM
OYSTERS CHEESE AND HAM SAID LAIGLE
AND THEY SEATED THEMSELVES AT A TABLE
THE WINE SHOP WAS EMPTY THERE WAS NO ONE THERE BUT THEMSELVES
GIBELOTTE KNOWING JOLY AND LAIGLE SET A BOTTLE OF WINE ON THE TABLE
WHILE THEY WERE BUSY WITH THEIR FIRST OYSTERS A HEAD APPEARED AT THE
HATCHWAY OF THE STAIRCASE AND A VOICE SAID
I AM PASSING BY
I SMELL FROM THE STREET A DELICIOUS ODOR OF BRIE
CHEESE
I ENTER IT WAS GRANTAIRE
GRANTAIRE TOOK A STOOL AND DREW UP TO THE TABLE
AT THE SIGHT OF GRANTAIRE GIBELOTTE PLACED TWO BOTTLES OF WINE ON THE
TABLE
THAT MADE THREE
ARE YOU GOING TO DRINK THOSE TWO BOTTLES LAIGLE INQUIRED OF
GRANTAIRE
GRANTAIRE REPLIED
ALL ARE INGENIOUS THOU ALONE ART INGENUOUS
TWO BOTTLES NEVER YET
ASTONISHED A MAN
THE OTHERS HAD BEGUN BY EATING GRANTAIRE BEGAN BY DRINKING
HALF A
BOTTLE WAS RAPIDLY GULPED DOWN
SO YOU HAVE A HOLE IN YOUR STOMACH BEGAN LAIGLE AGAIN
YOU HAVE ONE IN YOUR ELBOW SAID GRANTAIRE
AND AFTER HAVING EMPTIED HIS GLASS HE ADDED
AH BY THE WAY LAIGLE OF THE FUNERAL ORATION YOUR COAT IS OLD
I SHOULD HOPE SO RETORTED LAIGLE
THAT'S WHY WE GET ON WELL
TOGETHER MY COAT AND I
IT HAS ACQUIRED ALL MY FOLDS IT DOES NOT BIND
ME ANYWHERE IT IS MOULDED ON MY DEFORMITIES IT FALLS IN WITH ALL MY
MOVEMENTS I AM ONLY CONSCIOUS OF IT BECAUSE IT KEEPS ME WARM
OLD COATS
ARE JUST LIKE OLD FRIENDS
THAT'S TRUE EJACULATED JOLY STRIKING INTO THE DIALOGUE AN OLD GOAT
IS AN OLD ABI AMI FRIEND
ESPECIALLY IN THE MOUTH OF A MAN WHOSE HEAD IS STUFFED UP SAID
GRANTAIRE
GRANTAIRE DEMANDED LAIGLE HAVE YOU JUST COME FROM THE BOULEVARD
NO
WE HAVE JUST SEEN THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION PASS JOLY AND I
IT'S A MARVELLOUS SIGHT SAID JOLY
HOW QUIET THIS STREET IS EXCLAIMED LAIGLE
WHO WOULD SUSPECT THAT
PARIS WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN HOW PLAINLY IT IS TO BE SEEN THAT IN
FORMER DAYS THERE WERE NOTHING BUT CONVENTS HERE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
DU BREUL AND SAUVAL GIVE A LIST OF THEM AND SO DOES THE ABBE LEBEUF
THEY WERE ALL ROUND HERE THEY FAIRLY SWARMED BOOTED AND BAREFOOTED
SHAVEN BEARDED GRAY BLACK WHITE FRANCISCANS MINIMS CAPUCHINS
CARMELITES LITTLE AUGUSTINES GREAT AUGUSTINES OLD AUGUSTINES THERE
WAS NO END OF THEM
DON'T LET'S TALK OF MONKS INTERRUPTED GRANTAIRE IT MAKES ONE WANT
TO SCRATCH ONE'S SELF
THEN HE EXCLAIMED
BOUH I'VE JUST SWALLOWED A BAD OYSTER
NOW HYPOCHONDRIA IS TAKING
POSSESSION OF ME AGAIN
THE OYSTERS ARE SPOILED THE SERVANTS ARE UGLY
I HATE THE HUMAN RACE
I JUST PASSED THROUGH THE RUE RICHELIEU IN FRONT
OF THE BIG PUBLIC LIBRARY
THAT PILE OF OYSTER SHELLS WHICH IS CALLED
A LIBRARY IS DISGUSTING EVEN TO THINK OF
WHAT PAPER WHAT INK WHAT
SCRAWLING AND ALL THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN WHAT RASCAL WAS IT WHO SAID
THAT MAN WAS A FEATHERLESS BIPED 51 AND THEN I MET A PRETTY GIRL OF
MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO IS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE SPRING WORTHY TO BE CALLED
FLOREAL AND WHO IS DELIGHTED ENRAPTURED AS HAPPY AS THE ANGELS
BECAUSE A WRETCH YESTERDAY A FRIGHTFUL BANKER ALL SPOTTED WITH
SMALL POX DEIGNED TO TAKE A FANCY TO HER ALAS WOMAN KEEPS ON THE
WATCH FOR A PROTECTOR AS MUCH AS FOR A LOVER CATS CHASE MICE AS WELL
AS BIRDS
TWO MONTHS AGO THAT YOUNG WOMAN WAS VIRTUOUS IN AN ATTIC SHE
ADJUSTED LITTLE BRASS RINGS IN THE EYELET HOLES OF CORSETS WHAT DO
YOU CALL IT SHE SEWED SHE HAD A CAMP BED SHE DWELT BESIDE A POT
OF FLOWERS SHE WAS CONTENTED
NOW HERE SHE IS A BANKERESS
THIS
TRANSFORMATION TOOK PLACE LAST NIGHT
I MET THE VICTIM THIS MORNING IN
HIGH SPIRITS
THE HIDEOUS POINT ABOUT IT IS THAT THE JADE IS AS PRETTY
TO DAY AS SHE WAS YESTERDAY
HER FINANCIER DID NOT SHOW IN HER FACE
ROSES HAVE THIS ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE OVER WOMEN THAT THE TRACES
LEFT UPON THEM BY CATERPILLARS ARE VISIBLE
AH THERE IS NO MORALITY ON
EARTH
I CALL TO WITNESS THE MYRTLE THE SYMBOL OF LOVE THE LAUREL
THE SYMBOL OF AIR THE OLIVE THAT NINNY THE SYMBOL OF PEACE THE
APPLE TREE WHICH CAME NEAREST RANGLING ADAM WITH ITS PIPS AND THE
FIG TREE THE GRANDFATHER OF PETTICOATS
AS FOR RIGHT DO YOU KNOW WHAT
RIGHT IS THE GAULS COVET CLUSIUM ROME PROTECTS CLUSIUM AND DEMANDS
WHAT WRONG CLUSIUM HAS DONE TO THEM
BRENNUS ANSWERS 'THE WRONG THAT
ALBA DID TO YOU THE WRONG THAT FIDENAE DID TO YOU THE WRONG THAT THE
EQUES THE VOLSCI AND THE SABINES HAVE DONE TO YOU
THEY WERE YOUR
NEIGHBORS
THE CLUSIANS ARE OURS
WE UNDERSTAND NEIGHBORLINESS JUST AS
YOU DO
YOU HAVE STOLEN ALBA WE SHALL TAKE CLUSIUM ROME SAID 'YOU
SHALL NOT TAKE CLUSIUM BRENNUS TOOK ROME
THEN HE CRIED 'VAE VICTIS
THAT IS WHAT RIGHT IS
AH WHAT BEASTS OF PREY THERE ARE IN THIS WORLD
WHAT EAGLES IT MAKES MY FLESH CREEP
HE HELD OUT HIS GLASS TO JOLY WHO FILLED IT THEN HE DRANK AND WENT ON
HAVING HARDLY BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THIS GLASS OF WINE OF WHICH NO ONE
NOT EVEN HIMSELF HAD TAKEN ANY NOTICE
BRENNUS WHO TAKES ROME IS AN EAGLE THE BANKER WHO TAKES THE GRISETTE
IS AN EAGLE
THERE IS NO MORE MODESTY IN THE ONE CASE THAN IN THE OTHER
SO WE BELIEVE IN NOTHING
THERE IS BUT ONE REALITY DRINK
WHATEVER YOUR
OPINION MAY BE IN FAVOR OF THE LEAN COCK LIKE THE CANTON OF URI OR
IN FAVOR OF THE FAT COCK LIKE THE CANTON OF GLARIS IT MATTERS LITTLE
DRINK
YOU TALK TO ME OF THE BOULEVARD OF THAT PROCESSION ET CAETERA
ET CAETERA
COME NOW IS THERE GOING TO BE ANOTHER REVOLUTION THIS
POVERTY OF MEANS ON THE PART OF THE GOOD GOD ASTOUNDS ME
HE HAS TO KEEP
GREASING THE GROOVE OF EVENTS EVERY MOMENT
THERE IS A HITCH IT WON'T
WORK
QUICK A REVOLUTION THE GOOD GOD HAS HIS HANDS PERPETUALLY BLACK
WITH THAT CART GREASE
IF I WERE IN HIS PLACE I'D BE PERFECTLY SIMPLE
ABOUT IT I WOULD NOT WIND UP MY MECHANISM EVERY MINUTE I'D LEAD THE
HUMAN RACE IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY I'D WEAVE MATTERS MESH BY MESH
WITHOUT BREAKING THE THREAD I WOULD HAVE NO PROVISIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
I WOULD HAVE NO EXTRAORDINARY REPERTORY
WHAT THE REST OF YOU CALL
PROGRESS ADVANCES BY MEANS OF TWO MOTORS MEN AND EVENTS
BUT SAD TO
SAY FROM TIME TO TIME THE EXCEPTIONAL BECOMES NECESSARY
THE ORDINARY
TROUPE SUFFICES NEITHER FOR EVENT NOR FOR MEN AMONG MEN GENIUSES ARE
REQUIRED AMONG EVENTS REVOLUTIONS
GREAT ACCIDENTS ARE THE LAW THE
ORDER OF THINGS CANNOT DO WITHOUT THEM AND JUDGING FROM THE APPARITION
OF COMETS ONE WOULD BE TEMPTED TO THINK THAT HEAVEN ITSELF FINDS ACTORS
NEEDED FOR ITS PERFORMANCE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN ONE EXPECTS IT THE LEAST
GOD PLACARDS A METEOR ON THE WALL OF THE FIRMAMENT
SOME QUEER STAR
TURNS UP UNDERLINED BY AN ENORMOUS TAIL
AND THAT CAUSES THE DEATH
OF CAESAR
BRUTUS DEALS HIM A BLOW WITH A KNIFE AND GOD A BLOW WITH A
COMET
CRAC AND BEHOLD AN AURORA BOREALIS BEHOLD A REVOLUTION BEHOLD
A GREAT MAN '93 IN BIG LETTERS NAPOLEON ON GUARD THE COMET OF 1811
AT THE HEAD OF THE POSTER
AH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BLUE THEATRE ALL STUDDED
WITH UNEXPECTED FLASHES BOUM BOUM EXTRAORDINARY SHOW RAISE YOUR
EYES BOOBIES
EVERYTHING IS IN DISORDER THE STAR AS WELL AS THE DRAMA
GOOD GOD IT IS TOO MUCH AND NOT ENOUGH
THESE RESOURCES GATHERED FROM
EXCEPTION SEEM MAGNIFICENCE AND POVERTY
MY FRIENDS PROVIDENCE HAS
COME DOWN TO EXPEDIENTS
WHAT DOES A REVOLUTION PROVE THAT GOD IS IN A
QUANDRY
HE EFFECTS A COUP D'ETAT BECAUSE HE GOD HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO
MAKE BOTH ENDS MEET
IN FACT THIS CONFIRMS ME IN MY CONJECTURES AS
TO JEHOVAH'S FORTUNE AND WHEN I SEE SO MUCH DISTRESS IN HEAVEN AND ON
EARTH FROM THE BIRD WHO HAS NOT A GRAIN OF MILLET TO MYSELF WITHOUT A
HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVRES OF INCOME WHEN I SEE HUMAN DESTINY WHICH IS
VERY BADLY WORN AND EVEN ROYAL DESTINY WHICH IS THREADBARE WITNESS
THE PRINCE DE CONDE HUNG WHEN I SEE WINTER WHICH IS NOTHING BUT A RENT
IN THE ZENITH THROUGH WHICH THE WIND BLOWS WHEN I SEE SO MANY RAGS EVEN
IN THE PERFECTLY NEW PURPLE OF THE MORNING ON THE CRESTS OF HILLS WHEN
I SEE THE DROPS OF DEW THOSE MOCK PEARLS WHEN I SEE THE FROST THAT
PASTE WHEN I SEE HUMANITY RIPPED APART AND EVENTS PATCHED UP AND SO
MANY SPOTS ON THE SUN AND SO MANY HOLES IN THE MOON WHEN I SEE SO
MUCH MISERY EVERYWHERE I SUSPECT THAT GOD IS NOT RICH
THE APPEARANCE
EXISTS IT IS TRUE BUT I FEEL THAT HE IS HARD UP
HE GIVES A REVOLUTION
AS A TRADESMAN WHOSE MONEY BOX IS EMPTY GIVES A BALL
GOD MUST NOT BE
JUDGED FROM APPEARANCES
BENEATH THE GILDING OF HEAVEN I PERCEIVE
A POVERTY STRICKEN UNIVERSE
CREATION IS BANKRUPT
THAT IS WHY I AM
DISCONTENTED
HERE IT IS THE 4TH OF JUNE IT IS ALMOST NIGHT EVER SINCE
THIS MORNING I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR DAYLIGHT TO COME IT HAS NOT COME
AND I BET THAT IT WON'T COME ALL DAY
THIS IS THE INEXACTNESS OF AN
ILL PAID CLERK
YES EVERYTHING IS BADLY ARRANGED NOTHING FITS ANYTHING
ELSE THIS OLD WORLD IS ALL WARPED I TAKE MY STAND ON THE OPPOSITION
EVERYTHING GOES AWRY THE UNIVERSE IS A TEASE
IT'S LIKE CHILDREN THOSE
WHO WANT THEM HAVE NONE AND THOSE WHO DON'T WANT THEM HAVE THEM
TOTAL
I'M VEXED
BESIDES LAIGLE DE MEAUX THAT BALD HEAD OFFENDS MY SIGHT
IT HUMILIATES ME TO THINK THAT I AM OF THE SAME AGE AS THAT BALDY
HOWEVER I CRITICISE BUT I DO NOT INSULT
THE UNIVERSE IS WHAT IT IS
I SPEAK HERE WITHOUT EVIL INTENT AND TO EASE MY CONSCIENCE
RECEIVE
ETERNAL FATHER THE ASSURANCE OF MY DISTINGUISHED CONSIDERATION
AH
BY ALL THE SAINTS OF OLYMPUS AND BY ALL THE GODS OF PARADISE I WAS NOT
INTENDED TO BE A PARISIAN THAT IS TO SAY TO REBOUND FOREVER LIKE A
SHUTTLECOCK BETWEEN TWO BATTLEDORES FROM THE GROUP OF THE LOUNGERS TO
THE GROUP OF THE ROYSTERERS
I WAS MADE TO BE A TURK WATCHING ORIENTAL
HOURIS ALL DAY LONG EXECUTING THOSE EXQUISITE EGYPTIAN DANCES AS
SENSUOUS AS THE DREAM OF A CHASTE MAN OR A BEAUCERON PEASANT OR A
VENETIAN GENTLEMAN SURROUNDED BY GENTLEWOMEN OR A PETTY GERMAN PRINCE
FURNISHING THE HALF OF A FOOT SOLDIER TO THE GERMANIC CONFEDERATION AND
OCCUPYING HIS LEISURE WITH DRYING HIS BREECHES ON HIS HEDGE THAT IS TO
SAY HIS FRONTIER
THOSE ARE THE POSITIONS FOR WHICH I WAS BORN YES I
HAVE SAID A TURK AND I WILL NOT RETRACT
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE
CAN HABITUALLY TAKE TURKS IN BAD PART MOHAMMED HAD HIS GOOD POINTS
RESPECT FOR THE INVENTOR OF SERAGLIOS WITH HOURIS AND PARADISES WITH
ODALISQUES LET US NOT INSULT MOHAMMEDANISM THE ONLY RELIGION WHICH IS
ORNAMENTED WITH A HEN ROOST NOW I INSIST ON A DRINK
THE EARTH IS A
GREAT PIECE OF STUPIDITY
AND IT APPEARS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO FIGHT
ALL THOSE IMBECILES AND TO BREAK EACH OTHER'S PROFILES AND TO MASSACRE
EACH OTHER IN THE HEART OF SUMMER IN THE MONTH OF JUNE WHEN THEY MIGHT
GO OFF WITH A CREATURE ON THEIR ARM TO BREATHE THE IMMENSE HEAPS OF
NEW MOWN HAY IN THE MEADOWS REALLY PEOPLE DO COMMIT ALTOGETHER
TOO MANY FOLLIES
AN OLD BROKEN LANTERN WHICH I HAVE JUST SEEN AT A
BRIC A BRAC MERCHANT'S SUGGESTS A REFLECTION TO MY MIND IT IS TIME TO
ENLIGHTEN THE HUMAN RACE
YES BEHOLD ME SAD AGAIN
THAT'S WHAT COMES
OF SWALLOWING AN OYSTER AND A REVOLUTION THE WRONG WAY I AM GROWING
MELANCHOLY ONCE MORE
OH FRIGHTFUL OLD WORLD
PEOPLE STRIVE TURN EACH
OTHER OUT PROSTITUTE THEMSELVES KILL EACH OTHER AND GET USED TO IT
AND GRANTAIRE AFTER THIS FIT OF ELOQUENCE HAD A FIT OF COUGHING WHICH
WAS WELL EARNED
A PROPOS OF REVOLUTION SAID JOLY IT IS DECIDEDLY ABBERENT THAT
BARIUS IS IN LUB
DOES ANY ONE KNOW WITH WHOM DEMANDED LAIGLE
DO
NO
DO I TELL YOU
MARIUS' LOVE AFFAIRS EXCLAIMED GRANTAIRE
I CAN IMAGINE IT
MARIUS
IS A FOG AND HE MUST HAVE FOUND A VAPOR
MARIUS IS OF THE RACE OF
POETS
HE WHO SAYS POET SAYS FOOL MADMAN TYMBRAEUS APOLLO
MARIUS AND
HIS MARIE OR HIS MARION OR HIS MARIA OR HIS MARIETTE
THEY MUST MAKE
A QUEER PAIR OF LOVERS
I KNOW JUST WHAT IT IS LIKE
ECSTASIES IN WHICH
THEY FORGET TO KISS
PURE ON EARTH BUT JOINED IN HEAVEN
THEY ARE SOULS
POSSESSED OF SENSES
THEY LIE AMONG THE STARS
GRANTAIRE WAS ATTACKING HIS SECOND BOTTLE AND POSSIBLY HIS SECOND
HARANGUE WHEN A NEW PERSONAGE EMERGED FROM THE SQUARE APERTURE OF THE
STAIRS
IT WAS A BOY LESS THAN TEN YEARS OF AGE RAGGED VERY SMALL
YELLOW WITH AN ODD PHIZ A VIVACIOUS EYE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HAIR
DRENCHED WITH RAIN AND WEARING A CONTENTED AIR
THE CHILD UNHESITATINGLY MAKING HIS CHOICE AMONG THE THREE ADDRESSED
HIMSELF TO LAIGLE DE MEAUX
ARE YOU MONSIEUR BOSSUET
THAT IS MY NICKNAME REPLIED LAIGLE
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME
THIS
A TALL BLONDE FELLOW ON THE BOULEVARD SAID TO ME 'DO YOU KNOW
MOTHER HUCHELOUP I SAID 'YES RUE CHANVRERIE THE OLD MAN'S WIDOW
HE SAID TO ME 'GO THERE
THERE YOU WILL FIND M
BOSSUET
TELL HIM FROM
ME A B C IT'S A JOKE THAT THEY'RE PLAYING ON YOU ISN'T IT
HE GAVE
ME TEN SOUS
JOLY LEND ME TEN SOUS SAID LAIGLE AND TURNING TO GRANTAIRE
GRANTAIRE LEND ME TEN SOUS
THIS MADE TWENTY SOUS WHICH LAIGLE HANDED TO THE LAD
THANK YOU SIR SAID THE URCHIN
WHAT IS YOUR NAME INQUIRED LAIGLE
NAVET GAVROCHE'S FRIEND
STAY WITH US SAID LAIGLE
BREAKFAST WITH US SAID GRANTAIRE
THE CHILD REPLIED
I CAN'T I BELONG IN THE PROCESSION I'M THE ONE TO SHOUT 'DOWN WITH
POLIGNAC
AND EXECUTING A PROLONGED SCRAPE OF HIS FOOT BEHIND HIM WHICH IS THE
MOST RESPECTFUL OF ALL POSSIBLE SALUTES HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE
THE CHILD GONE GRANTAIRE TOOK THE WORD
THAT IS THE PURE BRED GAMIN
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY VARIETIES OF THE
GAMIN SPECIES
THE NOTARY'S GAMIN IS CALLED SKIP THE GUTTER THE COOK'S
GAMIN IS CALLED A SCULLION THE BAKER'S GAMIN IS CALLED A MITRON
THE LACKEY'S GAMIN IS CALLED A GROOM THE MARINE GAMIN IS CALLED THE
CABIN BOY THE SOLDIER'S GAMIN IS CALLED THE DRUMMER BOY THE PAINTER'S
GAMIN IS CALLED PAINT GRINDER THE TRADESMAN'S GAMIN IS CALLED AN
ERRAND BOY THE COURTESAN GAMIN IS CALLED THE MINION THE KINGLY GAMIN
IS CALLED THE DAUPHIN THE GOD GAMIN IS CALLED THE BAMBINO
IN THE MEANTIME LAIGLE WAS ENGAGED IN REFLECTION HE SAID HALF ALOUD
A B C THAT IS TO SAY THE BURIAL OF LAMARQUE
THE TALL BLONDE REMARKED GRANTAIRE IS ENJOLRAS WHO IS SENDING YOU
A WARNING
SHALL WE GO EJACULATED BOSSUET
IT'S RAIDING SAID JOLY
I HAVE SWORN TO GO THROUGH FIRE BUT NOT
THROUGH WATER
I DON'T WAND TO GED A GOLD
I SHALL STAY HERE SAID GRANTAIRE
I PREFER A BREAKFAST TO A HEARSE
CONCLUSION WE REMAIN SAID LAIGLE
WELL THEN LET US DRINK
BESIDES WE MIGHT MISS THE FUNERAL WITHOUT MISSING THE RIOT
AH THE RIOT I AM WITH YOU CRIED JOLY
LAIGLE RUBBED HIS HANDS
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TOUCH UP THE REVOLUTION OF 1830
AS A MATTER OF
FACT IT DOES HURT THE PEOPLE ALONG THE SEAMS
I DON'T THINK MUCH OF YOUR REVOLUTION SAID GRANTAIRE
I DON'T
EXECRATE THIS GOVERNMENT
IT IS THE CROWN TEMPERED BY THE COTTON
NIGHT CAP
IT IS A SCEPTRE ENDING IN AN UMBRELLA
IN FACT I THINK
THAT TO DAY WITH THE PRESENT WEATHER LOUIS PHILIPPE MIGHT UTILIZE HIS
ROYALTY IN TWO DIRECTIONS HE MIGHT EXTEND THE TIP OF THE SCEPTRE END
AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND OPEN THE UMBRELLA END AGAINST HEAVEN
THE ROOM WAS DARK LARGE CLOUDS HAD JUST FINISHED THE EXTINCTION OF
DAYLIGHT
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WINE SHOP OR IN THE STREET EVERY ONE
HAVING GONE OFF TO WATCH EVENTS
IS IT MID DAY OR MIDNIGHT CRIED BOSSUET
YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR HAND
BEFORE YOUR FACE
GIBELOTTE FETCH A LIGHT
GRANTAIRE WAS DRINKING IN A MELANCHOLY WAY
ENJOLRAS DISDAINS ME HE MUTTERED
ENJOLRAS SAID 'JOLY IS ILL
GRANTAIRE IS DRUNK IT WAS TO BOSSUET THAT HE SENT NAVET
IF HE HAD
COME FOR ME I WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED HIM
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR ENJOLRAS
I WON'T GO TO HIS FUNERAL
THIS RESOLUTION ONCE ARRIVED AT BOSSUET JOLY AND GRANTAIRE DID NOT
STIR FROM THE WINE SHOP
BY TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE TABLE AT
WHICH THEY SAT WAS COVERED WITH EMPTY BOTTLES
TWO CANDLES WERE BURNING
ON IT ONE IN A FLAT COPPER CANDLESTICK WHICH WAS PERFECTLY GREEN THE
OTHER IN THE NECK OF A CRACKED CARAFE
GRANTAIRE HAD SEDUCED JOLY AND
BOSSUET TO WINE BOSSUET AND JOLY HAD CONDUCTED GRANTAIRE BACK TOWARDS
CHEERFULNESS
AS FOR GRANTAIRE HE HAD GOT BEYOND WINE THAT MERELY MODERATE
INSPIRER OF DREAMS EVER SINCE MID DAY
WINE ENJOYS ONLY A CONVENTIONAL
POPULARITY WITH SERIOUS DRINKERS
THERE IS IN FACT IN THE MATTER
OF INEBRIETY WHITE MAGIC AND BLACK MAGIC WINE IS ONLY WHITE MAGIC
GRANTAIRE WAS A DARING DRINKER OF DREAMS
THE BLACKNESS OF A TERRIBLE
FIT OF DRUNKENNESS YAWNING BEFORE HIM FAR FROM ARRESTING HIM ATTRACTED
HIM
HE HAD ABANDONED THE BOTTLE AND TAKEN TO THE BEERGLASS
THE
BEER GLASS IS THE ABYSS
HAVING NEITHER OPIUM NOR HASHISH ON HAND AND
BEING DESIROUS OF FILLING HIS BRAIN WITH TWILIGHT HE HAD HAD RECOURSE
TO THAT FEARFUL MIXTURE OF BRANDY STOUT ABSINTHE WHICH PRODUCES THE
MOST TERRIBLE OF LETHARGIES
IT IS OF THESE THREE VAPORS BEER BRANDY
AND ABSINTHE THAT THE LEAD OF THE SOUL IS COMPOSED
THEY ARE THREE
GROOMS THE CELESTIAL BUTTERFLY IS DROWNED IN THEM AND THERE ARE FORMED
THERE IN A MEMBRANOUS SMOKE VAGUELY CONDENSED INTO THE WING OF THE BAT
THREE MUTE FURIES NIGHTMARE NIGHT AND DEATH WHICH HOVER ABOUT THE
SLUMBERING PSYCHE
GRANTAIRE HAD NOT YET REACHED THAT LAMENTABLE PHASE FAR FROM IT
HE WAS
TREMENDOUSLY GAY AND BOSSUET AND JOLY RETORTED
THEY CLINKED GLASSES
GRANTAIRE ADDED TO THE ECCENTRIC ACCENTUATION OF WORDS AND IDEAS
A PECULIARITY OF GESTURE HE RESTED HIS LEFT FIST ON HIS KNEE WITH
DIGNITY HIS ARM FORMING A RIGHT ANGLE AND WITH CRAVAT UNTIED SEATED
ASTRIDE A STOOL HIS FULL GLASS IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE HURLED SOLEMN
WORDS AT THE BIG MAID SERVANT MATELOTE
LET THE DOORS OF THE PALACE BE THROWN OPEN LET EVERY ONE BE A MEMBER
OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY AND HAVE THE RIGHT TO EMBRACE MADAME HUCHELOUP
LET US DRINK
AND TURNING TO MADAME HUCHELOUP HE ADDED
WOMAN ANCIENT AND CONSECRATED BY USE DRAW NEAR THAT I MAY CONTEMPLATE
THEE
AND JOLY EXCLAIMED
MATELOTE AND GIBELOTTE DOD'T GIB GRANTAIRE ANYTHING MORE TO DRINK
HE HAS ALREADY DEVOURED SINCE THIS BORDING IN WILD PRODIGALITY TWO
FRANCS AND NINETY FIVE CENTIBES
AND GRANTAIRE BEGAN AGAIN
WHO HAS BEEN UNHOOKING THE STARS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION AND PUTTING
THEM ON THE TABLE IN THE GUISE OF CANDLES
BOSSUET THOUGH VERY DRUNK PRESERVED HIS EQUANIMITY
HE WAS SEATED ON THE SILL OF THE OPEN WINDOW WETTING HIS BACK IN THE
FALLING RAIN AND GAZING AT HIS TWO FRIENDS
ALL AT ONCE HE HEARD A TUMULT BEHIND HIM HURRIED FOOTSTEPS CRIES OF
TO ARMS HE TURNED ROUND AND SAW IN THE RUE SAINT DENIS AT THE END
OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE ENJOLRAS PASSING GUN IN HAND AND GAVROCHE
WITH HIS PISTOL FEUILLY WITH HIS SWORD COURFEYRAC WITH HIS SWORD AND
JEAN PROUVAIRE WITH HIS BLUNDERBUSS COMBEFERRE WITH HIS GUN BAHOREL
WITH HIS GUN AND THE WHOLE ARMED AND STORMY RABBLE WHICH WAS FOLLOWING
THEM
THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE WAS NOT MORE THAN A GUNSHOT LONG
BOSSUET
IMPROVISED A SPEAKING TRUMPET FROM HIS TWO HANDS PLACED AROUND HIS
MOUTH AND SHOUTED
COURFEYRAC COURFEYRAC HOHEE
COURFEYRAC HEARD THE SHOUT CAUGHT SIGHT OF BOSSUET AND ADVANCED A FEW
PACES INTO THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE SHOUTING WHAT DO YOU WANT WHICH
CROSSED A WHERE ARE YOU GOING
TO MAKE A BARRICADE REPLIED COURFEYRAC
WELL HERE THIS IS A GOOD PLACE MAKE IT HERE
THAT'S TRUE AIGLE SAID COURFEYRAC
AND AT A SIGNAL FROM COURFEYRAC THE MOB FLUNG THEMSELVES INTO THE RUE
DE LA CHANVRERIE
CHAPTER III NIGHT BEGINS TO DESCEND UPON GRANTAIRE
THE SPOT WAS IN FACT ADMIRABLY ADAPTED THE ENTRANCE TO THE STREET
WIDENED OUT THE OTHER EXTREMITY NARROWED TOGETHER INTO A POCKET
WITHOUT EXIT
CORINTHE CREATED AN OBSTACLE THE RUE MONDETOUR WAS EASILY
BARRICADED ON THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT NO ATTACK WAS POSSIBLE EXCEPT
FROM THE RUE SAINT DENIS THAT IS TO SAY IN FRONT AND IN FULL SIGHT
BOSSUET HAD THE COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE OF A FASTING HANNIBAL
TERROR HAD SEIZED ON THE WHOLE STREET AT THE IRRUPTION OF THE MOB
THERE
WAS NOT A PASSER BY WHO DID NOT GET OUT OF SIGHT
IN THE SPACE OF A
FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE REAR TO RIGHT AND LEFT SHOPS STABLES
AREA DOORS WINDOWS BLINDS ATTIC SKYLIGHTS SHUTTERS OF EVERY
DESCRIPTION WERE CLOSED FROM THE GROUND FLOOR TO THE ROOF
A TERRIFIED
OLD WOMAN FIXED A MATTRESS IN FRONT OF HER WINDOW ON TWO CLOTHES POLES
FOR DRYING LINEN IN ORDER TO DEADEN THE EFFECT OF MUSKETRY
THE
WINE SHOP ALONE REMAINED OPEN AND THAT FOR A VERY GOOD REASON THAT THE
MOB HAD RUSHED INTO IT AH MY GOD AH MY GOD SIGHED MAME HUCHELOUP
BOSSUET HAD GONE DOWN TO MEET COURFEYRAC
JOLY WHO HAD PLACED HIMSELF AT THE WINDOW EXCLAIMED
COURFEYRAC YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BROUGHT AN UMBRELLA
YOU WILL GATCH
GOLD
IN THE MEANTIME IN THE SPACE OF A FEW MINUTES TWENTY IRON BARS HAD
BEEN WRENCHED FROM THE GRATED FRONT OF THE WINE SHOP TEN FATHOMS OF
STREET HAD BEEN UNPAVED GAVROCHE AND BAHOREL HAD SEIZED IN ITS PASSAGE
AND OVERTURNED THE DRAY OF A LIME DEALER NAMED ANCEAU THIS DRAY
CONTAINED THREE BARRELS OF LIME WHICH THEY PLACED BENEATH THE PILES
OF PAVING STONES ENJOLRAS RAISED THE CELLAR TRAP AND ALL THE WIDOW
HUCHELOUP'S EMPTY CASKS WERE USED TO FLANK THE BARRELS OF LIME FEUILLY
WITH HIS FINGERS SKILLED IN PAINTING THE DELICATE STICKS OF FANS HAD
BACKED UP THE BARRELS AND THE DRAY WITH TWO MASSIVE HEAPS OF BLOCKS OF
ROUGH STONE
BLOCKS WHICH WERE IMPROVISED LIKE THE REST AND PROCURED
NO ONE KNOWS WHERE
THE BEAMS WHICH SERVED AS PROPS WERE TORN FROM
THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE FRONTS AND LAID ON THE CASKS
WHEN BOSSUET AND
COURFEYRAC TURNED ROUND HALF THE STREET WAS ALREADY BARRED WITH
A RAMPART HIGHER THAN A MAN
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THE HAND OF THE
POPULACE FOR BUILDING EVERYTHING THAT IS BUILT BY DEMOLISHING
MATELOTE AND GIBELOTTE HAD MINGLED WITH THE WORKERS
GIBELOTTE WENT AND
CAME LOADED WITH RUBBISH
HER LASSITUDE HELPED ON THE BARRICADE
SHE
SERVED THE BARRICADE AS SHE WOULD HAVE SERVED WINE WITH A SLEEPY AIR
AN OMNIBUS WITH TWO WHITE HORSES PASSED THE END OF THE STREET
BOSSUET STRODE OVER THE PAVING STONES RAN TO IT STOPPED THE DRIVER
MADE THE PASSENGERS ALIGHT OFFERED HIS HAND TO THE LADIES DISMISSED
THE CONDUCTOR AND RETURNED LEADING THE VEHICLE AND THE HORSES BY THE
BRIDLE
OMNIBUSES SAID HE DO NOT PASS THE CORINTHE
NON LICET OMNIBUS ADIRE
CORINTHUM
AN INSTANT LATER THE HORSES WERE UNHARNESSED AND WENT OFF AT THEIR
WILL THROUGH THE RUE MONDETOUR AND THE OMNIBUS LYING ON ITS SIDE
COMPLETED THE BAR ACROSS THE STREET
MAME HUCHELOUP QUITE UPSET HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE FIRST STORY
HER EYES WERE VAGUE AND STARED WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING AND SHE CRIED
IN A LOW TONE
HER TERRIFIED SHRIEKS DID NOT DARE TO EMERGE FROM HER
THROAT
THE END OF THE WORLD HAS COME SHE MUTTERED
JOLY DEPOSITED A KISS ON MAME HUCHELOUP'S FAT RED WRINKLED NECK AND
SAID TO GRANTAIRE MY DEAR FELLOW I HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED A WOMAN'S
NECK AS AN INFINITELY DELICATE THING
BUT GRANTAIRE ATTAINED TO THE HIGHEST REGIONS OF DITHRYAMB
MATELOTE
HAD MOUNTED TO THE FIRST FLOOR ONCE MORE GRANTAIRE SEIZED HER ROUND HER
WAIST AND GAVE VENT TO LONG BURSTS OF LAUGHTER AT THE WINDOW
MATELOTE IS HOMELY HE CRIED MATELOTE IS OF A DREAM OF UGLINESS
MATELOTE IS A CHIMAERA
THIS IS THE SECRET OF HER BIRTH A GOTHIC
PYGMALION WHO WAS MAKING GARGOYLES FOR CATHEDRALS FELL IN LOVE WITH
ONE OF THEM THE MOST HORRIBLE ONE FINE MORNING
HE BESOUGHT LOVE TO
GIVE IT LIFE AND THIS PRODUCED MATELOTE
LOOK AT HER CITIZENS SHE HAS
CHROMATE OF LEAD COLORED HAIR LIKE TITIAN'S MISTRESS AND SHE IS A GOOD
GIRL
I GUARANTEE THAT SHE WILL FIGHT WELL
EVERY GOOD GIRL CONTAINS
A HERO
AS FOR MOTHER HUCHELOUP SHE'S AN OLD WARRIOR
LOOK AT HER
MOUSTACHES SHE INHERITED THEM FROM HER HUSBAND
A HUSSAR INDEED SHE
WILL FIGHT TOO
THESE TWO ALONE WILL STRIKE TERROR TO THE HEART OF THE
BANLIEUE
COMRADES WE SHALL OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AS TRUE AS THERE
ARE FIFTEEN INTERMEDIARY ACIDS BETWEEN MARGARIC ACID AND FORMIC ACID
HOWEVER THAT IS A MATTER OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE TO ME
GENTLEMEN MY
FATHER ALWAYS DETESTED ME BECAUSE I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MATHEMATICS
I UNDERSTAND ONLY LOVE AND LIBERTY
I AM GRANTAIRE THE GOOD FELLOW
HAVING NEVER HAD ANY MONEY I NEVER ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF IT AND THE
RESULT IS THAT I HAVE NEVER LACKED IT BUT IF I HAD BEEN RICH THERE
WOULD HAVE BEEN NO MORE POOR PEOPLE YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN OH IF THE
KIND HEARTS ONLY HAD FAT PURSES HOW MUCH BETTER THINGS WOULD GO I
PICTURE MYSELF JESUS CHRIST WITH ROTHSCHILD'S FORTUNE HOW MUCH GOOD HE
WOULD DO MATELOTE EMBRACE ME YOU ARE VOLUPTUOUS AND TIMID YOU HAVE
CHEEKS WHICH INVITE THE KISS OF A SISTER AND LIPS WHICH CLAIM THE KISS
OF A LOVER
HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU CASK SAID COURFEYRAC
GRANTAIRE RETORTED
I AM THE CAPITOUL 52 AND THE MASTER OF THE FLORAL GAMES
ENJOLRAS WHO WAS STANDING ON THE CREST OF THE BARRICADE GUN IN HAND
RAISED HIS BEAUTIFUL AUSTERE FACE
ENJOLRAS AS THE READER KNOWS HAD
SOMETHING OF THE SPARTAN AND OF THE PURITAN IN HIS COMPOSITION
HE WOULD
HAVE PERISHED AT THERMOPYLAE WITH LEONIDAS AND BURNED AT DROGHEDA WITH
CROMWELL
GRANTAIRE HE SHOUTED GO GET RID OF THE FUMES OF YOUR WINE SOMEWHERE
ELSE THAN HERE
THIS IS THE PLACE FOR ENTHUSIASM NOT FOR DRUNKENNESS
DON'T DISGRACE THE BARRICADE
THIS ANGRY SPEECH PRODUCED A SINGULAR EFFECT ON GRANTAIRE
ONE WOULD
HAVE SAID THAT HE HAD HAD A GLASS OF COLD WATER FLUNG IN HIS FACE
HE
SEEMED TO BE RENDERED SUDDENLY SOBER
HE SAT DOWN PUT HIS ELBOWS ON A TABLE NEAR THE WINDOW LOOKED AT
ENJOLRAS WITH INDESCRIBABLE GENTLENESS AND SAID TO HIM
LET ME SLEEP HERE
GO AND SLEEP SOMEWHERE ELSE CRIED ENJOLRAS
BUT GRANTAIRE STILL KEEPING HIS TENDER AND TROUBLED EYES FIXED ON HIM
REPLIED
LET ME SLEEP HERE UNTIL I DIE
ENJOLRAS REGARDED HIM WITH DISDAINFUL EYES
GRANTAIRE YOU ARE INCAPABLE OF BELIEVING OF THINKING OF WILLING OF
LIVING AND OF DYING
GRANTAIRE REPLIED IN A GRAVE TONE
YOU WILL SEE
HE STAMMERED A FEW MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS THEN HIS HEAD FELL HEAVILY
ON THE TABLE AND AS IS THE USUAL EFFECT OF THE SECOND PERIOD OF
INEBRIETY INTO WHICH ENJOLRAS HAD ROUGHLY AND ABRUPTLY THRUST HIM AN
INSTANT LATER HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP
CHAPTER IV AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE THE WIDOW HUCHELOUP
BAHOREL IN ECSTASIES OVER THE BARRICADE SHOUTED
HERE'S THE STREET IN ITS LOW NECKED DRESS HOW WELL IT LOOKS
COURFEYRAC AS HE DEMOLISHED THE WINE SHOP TO SOME EXTENT SOUGHT TO
CONSOLE THE WIDOWED PROPRIETRESS
MOTHER HUCHELOUP WEREN'T YOU COMPLAINING THE OTHER DAY BECAUSE YOU
HAD HAD A NOTICE SERVED ON YOU FOR INFRINGING THE LAW BECAUSE GIBELOTTE
SHOOK A COUNTERPANE OUT OF YOUR WINDOW
YES MY GOOD MONSIEUR COURFEYRAC
AH GOOD HEAVENS ARE YOU GOING
TO PUT THAT TABLE OF MINE IN YOUR HORROR TOO AND IT WAS FOR THE
COUNTERPANE AND ALSO FOR A POT OF FLOWERS WHICH FELL FROM THE ATTIC
WINDOW INTO THE STREET THAT THE GOVERNMENT COLLECTED A FINE OF A
HUNDRED FRANCS
IF THAT ISN'T AN ABOMINATION WHAT IS
WELL MOTHER HUCHELOUP WE ARE AVENGING YOU
MOTHER HUCHELOUP DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND VERY CLEARLY THE BENEFIT
WHICH SHE WAS TO DERIVE FROM THESE REPRISALS MADE ON HER ACCOUNT
SHE
WAS SATISFIED AFTER THE MANNER OF THAT ARAB WOMAN WHO HAVING RECEIVED
A BOX ON THE EAR FROM HER HUSBAND WENT TO COMPLAIN TO HER FATHER AND
CRIED FOR VENGEANCE SAYING FATHER YOU OWE MY HUSBAND AFFRONT FOR
AFFRONT THE FATHER ASKED ON WHICH CHEEK DID YOU RECEIVE THE BLOW
ON THE LEFT CHEEK THE FATHER SLAPPED HER RIGHT CHEEK AND SAID NOW
YOU ARE SATISFIED
GO TELL YOUR HUSBAND THAT HE BOXED MY DAUGHTER'S
EARS AND THAT I HAVE ACCORDINGLY BOXED HIS WIFE'S
THE RAIN HAD CEASED
RECRUITS HAD ARRIVED
WORKMEN HAD BROUGHT UNDER
THEIR BLOUSES A BARREL OF POWDER A BASKET CONTAINING BOTTLES OF
VITRIOL TWO OR THREE CARNIVAL TORCHES AND A BASKET FILLED WITH
FIRE POTS LEFT OVER FROM THE KING'S FESTIVAL THIS FESTIVAL WAS VERY
RECENT HAVING TAKEN PLACE ON THE 1ST OF MAY
IT WAS SAID THAT THESE
MUNITIONS CAME FROM A GROCER IN THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE NAMED PEPIN
THEY SMASHED THE ONLY STREET LANTERN IN THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE
THE LANTERN CORRESPONDING TO ONE IN THE RUE SAINT DENIS AND ALL
THE LANTERNS IN THE SURROUNDING STREETS DE MONDETOUR DU CYGNE DES
PRECHEURS AND DE LA GRANDE AND DE LA PETITE TRUANDERIE
ENJOLRAS COMBEFERRE AND COURFEYRAC DIRECTED EVERYTHING
TWO BARRICADES
WERE NOW IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AT ONCE BOTH OF THEM RESTING ON THE
CORINTHE HOUSE AND FORMING A RIGHT ANGLE THE LARGER SHUT OFF THE RUE
DE LA CHANVRERIE THE OTHER CLOSED THE RUE MONDETOUR ON THE SIDE OF
THE RUE DE CYGNE
THIS LAST BARRICADE WHICH WAS VERY NARROW WAS
CONSTRUCTED ONLY OF CASKS AND PAVING STONES
THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTY
WORKERS ON IT THIRTY WERE ARMED WITH GUNS FOR ON THEIR WAY THEY HAD
EFFECTED A WHOLESALE LOAN FROM AN ARMORER'S SHOP
NOTHING COULD BE MORE BIZARRE AND AT THE SAME TIME MORE MOTLEY THAN THIS
TROOP
ONE HAD A ROUND JACKET A CAVALRY SABRE AND TWO HOLSTER PISTOLS
ANOTHER WAS IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES WITH A ROUND HAT AND A POWDER HORN
SLUNG AT HIS SIDE A THIRD WORE A PLASTRON OF NINE SHEETS OF GRAY PAPER
AND WAS ARMED WITH A SADDLER'S AWL
THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS SHOUTING
LET US EXTERMINATE THEM TO THE LAST MAN AND DIE AT THE POINT OF OUR
BAYONET THIS MAN HAD NO BAYONET
ANOTHER SPREAD OUT OVER HIS COAT THE
CROSS BELT AND CARTRIDGE BOX OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN THE COVER OF THE
CARTRIDGE BOX BEING ORNAMENTED WITH THIS INSCRIPTION IN RED WORSTED
PUBLIC ORDER
THERE WERE A GREAT MANY GUNS BEARING THE NUMBERS OF THE
LEGIONS FEW HATS NO CRAVATS MANY BARE ARMS SOME PIKES
ADD TO
THIS ALL AGES ALL SORTS OF FACES SMALL PALE YOUNG MEN AND BRONZED
LONGSHOREMEN
ALL WERE IN HASTE AND AS THEY HELPED EACH OTHER THEY
DISCUSSED THE POSSIBLE CHANCES
THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE SUCCOR ABOUT
THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THAT THEY WERE SURE OF ONE REGIMENT THAT
PARIS WOULD RISE
TERRIBLE SAYINGS WITH WHICH WAS MINGLED A SORT OF
CORDIAL JOVIALITY
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED THEM BROTHERS BUT THEY DID
NOT KNOW EACH OTHER'S NAMES
GREAT PERILS HAVE THIS FINE CHARACTERISTIC
THAT THEY BRING TO LIGHT THE FRATERNITY OF STRANGERS
A FIRE HAD BEEN
LIGHTED IN THE KITCHEN AND THERE THEY WERE ENGAGED IN MOULDING INTO
BULLETS PEWTER MUGS SPOONS FORKS AND ALL THE BRASS TABLE WARE OF
THE ESTABLISHMENT
IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL THEY DRANK
CAPS AND
BUCKSHOT WERE MIXED PELL MELL ON THE TABLES WITH GLASSES OF WINE
IN
THE BILLIARD HALL MAME HUCHELOUP MATELOTE AND GIBELOTTE VARIOUSLY
MODIFIED BY TERROR WHICH HAD STUPEFIED ONE RENDERED ANOTHER
BREATHLESS AND ROUSED THE THIRD WERE TEARING UP OLD DISH CLOTHS AND
MAKING LINT THREE INSURGENTS WERE ASSISTING THEM THREE BUSHY HAIRED
JOLLY BLADES WITH BEARDS AND MOUSTACHES WHO PLUCKED AWAY AT THE LINEN
WITH THE FINGERS OF SEAMSTRESSES AND WHO MADE THEM TREMBLE
THE MAN OF LOFTY STATURE WHOM COURFEYRAC COMBEFERRE AND ENJOLRAS HAD
OBSERVED AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE JOINED THE MOB AT THE CORNER OF THE
RUE DES BILLETTES WAS AT WORK ON THE SMALLER BARRICADE AND WAS MAKING
HIMSELF USEFUL THERE
GAVROCHE WAS WORKING ON THE LARGER ONE
AS FOR THE
YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN WAITING FOR COURFEYRAC AT HIS LODGINGS AND WHO
HAD INQUIRED FOR M
MARIUS HE HAD DISAPPEARED AT ABOUT THE TIME WHEN
THE OMNIBUS HAD BEEN OVERTURNED
GAVROCHE COMPLETELY CARRIED AWAY AND RADIANT HAD UNDERTAKEN TO GET
EVERYTHING IN READINESS
HE WENT CAME MOUNTED DESCENDED RE MOUNTED
WHISTLED AND SPARKLED
HE SEEMED TO BE THERE FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF
ALL
HAD HE ANY INCENTIVE YES CERTAINLY HIS POVERTY HAD HE WINGS
YES CERTAINLY HIS JOY
GAVROCHE WAS A WHIRLWIND
HE WAS CONSTANTLY
VISIBLE HE WAS INCESSANTLY AUDIBLE
HE FILLED THE AIR AS HE WAS
EVERYWHERE AT ONCE
HE WAS A SORT OF ALMOST IRRITATING UBIQUITY NO HALT
WAS POSSIBLE WITH HIM
THE ENORMOUS BARRICADE FELT HIM ON ITS HAUNCHES
HE TROUBLED THE LOUNGERS HE EXCITED THE IDLE HE REANIMATED THE WEARY
HE GREW IMPATIENT OVER THE THOUGHTFUL HE INSPIRED GAYETY IN SOME
AND BREATH IN OTHERS WRATH IN OTHERS MOVEMENT IN ALL NOW PRICKING
A STUDENT NOW BITING AN ARTISAN HE ALIGHTED PAUSED FLEW OFF AGAIN
HOVERED OVER THE TUMULT AND THE EFFORT SPRANG FROM ONE PARTY TO
ANOTHER MURMURING AND HUMMING AND HARASSED THE WHOLE COMPANY A FLY ON
THE IMMENSE REVOLUTIONARY COACH
PERPETUAL MOTION WAS IN HIS LITTLE ARMS AND PERPETUAL CLAMOR IN HIS
LITTLE LUNGS
COURAGE MORE PAVING STONES MORE CASKS MORE MACHINES WHERE ARE YOU
NOW A HOD OF PLASTER FOR ME TO STOP THIS HOLE WITH YOUR BARRICADE
IS VERY SMALL
IT MUST BE CARRIED UP
PUT EVERYTHING ON IT FLING
EVERYTHING THERE STICK IT ALL IN
BREAK DOWN THE HOUSE
A BARRICADE IS
MOTHER GIBOU'S TEA
HULLO HERE'S A GLASS DOOR
THIS ELICITED AN EXCLAMATION FROM THE WORKERS
A GLASS DOOR WHAT DO YOU EXPECT US TO DO WITH A GLASS DOOR TUBERCLE
HERCULES YOURSELVES RETORTED GAVROCHE
A GLASS DOOR IS AN EXCELLENT
THING IN A BARRICADE
IT DOES NOT PREVENT AN ATTACK BUT IT PREVENTS THE
ENEMY TAKING IT
SO YOU'VE NEVER PRIGGED APPLES OVER A WALL WHERE THERE
WERE BROKEN BOTTLES A GLASS DOOR CUTS THE CORNS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
WHEN THEY TRY TO MOUNT ON THE BARRICADE
PARDI GLASS IS A TREACHEROUS
THING
WELL YOU HAVEN'T A VERY WILDLY LIVELY IMAGINATION COMRADES
HOWEVER HE WAS FURIOUS OVER HIS TRIGGERLESS PISTOL
HE WENT FROM ONE TO
ANOTHER DEMANDING A GUN I WANT A GUN WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME A GUN
GIVE YOU A GUN SAID COMBEFERRE
COME NOW SAID GAVROCHE WHY NOT I HAD ONE IN 1830 WHEN WE HAD A
DISPUTE WITH CHARLES X
ENJOLRAS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
WHEN THERE ARE ENOUGH FOR THE MEN WE WILL GIVE SOME TO THE CHILDREN
GAVROCHE WHEELED ROUND HAUGHTILY AND ANSWERED
IF YOU ARE KILLED BEFORE ME I SHALL TAKE YOURS
GAMIN SAID ENJOLRAS
GREENHORN SAID GAVROCHE
A DANDY WHO HAD LOST HIS WAY AND WHO LOUNGED PAST THE END OF THE STREET
CREATED A DIVERSION GAVROCHE SHOUTED TO HIM
COME WITH US YOUNG FELLOW WELL NOW DON'T WE DO ANYTHING FOR THIS OLD
COUNTRY OF OURS
THE DANDY FLED
CHAPTER V PREPARATIONS
THE JOURNALS OF THE DAY WHICH SAID THAT THAT NEARLY IMPREGNABLE
STRUCTURE OF THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE AS THEY CALL
IT REACHED TO THE LEVEL OF THE FIRST FLOOR WERE MISTAKEN
THE FACT IS
THAT IT DID NOT EXCEED AN AVERAGE HEIGHT OF SIX OR SEVEN FEET
IT WAS
BUILT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE COMBATANTS COULD AT THEIR WILL EITHER
DISAPPEAR BEHIND IT OR DOMINATE THE BARRIER AND EVEN SCALE ITS CREST BY
MEANS OF A QUADRUPLE ROW OF PAVING STONES PLACED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
AND ARRANGED AS STEPS IN THE INTERIOR
ON THE OUTSIDE THE FRONT OF THE
BARRICADE COMPOSED OF PILES OF PAVING STONES AND CASKS BOUND TOGETHER
BY BEAMS AND PLANKS WHICH WERE ENTANGLED IN THE WHEELS OF ANCEAU'S DRAY
AND OF THE OVERTURNED OMNIBUS HAD A BRISTLING AND INEXTRICABLE ASPECT
AN APERTURE LARGE ENOUGH TO ALLOW A MAN TO PASS THROUGH HAD BEEN MADE
BETWEEN THE WALL OF THE HOUSES AND THE EXTREMITY OF THE BARRICADE WHICH
WAS FURTHEST FROM THE WINE SHOP SO THAT AN EXIT WAS POSSIBLE AT THIS
POINT
THE POLE OF THE OMNIBUS WAS PLACED UPRIGHT AND HELD UP WITH
ROPES AND A RED FLAG FASTENED TO THIS POLE FLOATED OVER THE
BARRICADE
THE LITTLE MONDETOUR BARRICADE HIDDEN BEHIND THE WINE SHOP BUILDING
WAS NOT VISIBLE
THE TWO BARRICADES UNITED FORMED A VERITABLE REDOUBT
ENJOLRAS AND COURFEYRAC HAD NOT THOUGHT FIT TO BARRICADE THE OTHER
FRAGMENT OF THE RUE MONDETOUR WHICH OPENS THROUGH THE RUE DES PRECHEURS
AN ISSUE INTO THE HALLES WISHING NO DOUBT TO PRESERVE A POSSIBLE
COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTSIDE AND NOT ENTERTAINING MUCH FEAR OF
AN ATTACK THROUGH THE DANGEROUS AND DIFFICULT STREET OF THE RUE DES
PRECHEURS
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS ISSUE WHICH WAS LEFT FREE AND WHICH
CONSTITUTED WHAT FOLARD IN HIS STRATEGICAL STYLE WOULD HAVE TERMED A
BRANCH AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALSO THE NARROW CUTTING ARRANGED ON THE
RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE WHERE THE WINE SHOP
FORMED A SALIENT ANGLE PRESENTED AN IRREGULAR SQUARE CLOSED ON ALL
SIDES
THERE EXISTED AN INTERVAL OF TWENTY PACES BETWEEN THE GRAND
BARRIER AND THE LOFTY HOUSES WHICH FORMED THE BACKGROUND OF THE STREET
SO THAT ONE MIGHT SAY THAT THE BARRICADE RESTED ON THESE HOUSES ALL
INHABITED BUT CLOSED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
ALL THIS WORK WAS PERFORMED WITHOUT ANY HINDRANCE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
AND WITHOUT THIS HANDFUL OF BOLD MEN SEEING A SINGLE BEAR SKIN CAP OR
A SINGLE BAYONET MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE
THE VERY BOURGEOIS WHO STILL
VENTURED AT THIS HOUR OF RIOT TO ENTER THE RUE SAINT DENIS CAST A
GLANCE AT THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BARRICADE AND
REDOUBLED THEIR PACE
THE TWO BARRICADES BEING FINISHED AND THE FLAG RUN UP A TABLE WAS
DRAGGED OUT OF THE WINE SHOP AND COURFEYRAC MOUNTED ON THE TABLE
ENJOLRAS BROUGHT THE SQUARE COFFER AND COURFEYRAC OPENED IT
THIS
COFFER WAS FILLED WITH CARTRIDGES
WHEN THE MOB SAW THE CARTRIDGES A
TREMOR RAN THROUGH THE BRAVEST AND A MOMENTARY SILENCE ENSUED
COURFEYRAC DISTRIBUTED THEM WITH A SMILE
EACH ONE RECEIVED THIRTY CARTRIDGES
MANY HAD POWDER AND SET ABOUT
MAKING OTHERS WITH THE BULLETS WHICH THEY HAD RUN
AS FOR THE BARREL OF
POWDER IT STOOD ON A TABLE ON ONE SIDE NEAR THE DOOR AND WAS HELD IN
RESERVE
THE ALARM BEAT WHICH RAN THROUGH ALL PARIS DID NOT CEASE BUT IT HAD
FINALLY COME TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A MONOTONOUS NOISE TO WHICH THEY NO
LONGER PAID ANY ATTENTION
THIS NOISE RETREATED AT TIMES AND AGAIN DREW
NEAR WITH MELANCHOLY UNDULATIONS
THEY LOADED THE GUNS AND CARBINES ALL TOGETHER WITHOUT HASTE WITH
SOLEMN GRAVITY
ENJOLRAS WENT AND STATIONED THREE SENTINELS OUTSIDE THE
BARRICADES ONE IN THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE THE SECOND IN THE RUE DES
PRECHEURS THE THIRD AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DE LA PETITE TRUANDERIE
THEN THE BARRICADES HAVING BEEN BUILT THE POSTS ASSIGNED THE GUNS
LOADED THE SENTINELS STATIONED THEY WAITED ALONE IN THOSE REDOUBTABLE
STREETS THROUGH WHICH NO ONE PASSED ANY LONGER SURROUNDED BY THOSE
DUMB HOUSES WHICH SEEMED DEAD AND IN WHICH NO HUMAN MOVEMENT PALPITATED
ENVELOPED IN THE DEEPENING SHADES OF TWILIGHT WHICH WAS DRAWING ON
IN THE MIDST OF THAT SILENCE THROUGH WHICH SOMETHING COULD BE FELT
ADVANCING AND WHICH HAD ABOUT IT SOMETHING TRAGIC AND TERRIFYING
ISOLATED ARMED DETERMINED AND TRANQUIL
CHAPTER VI WAITING
DURING THOSE HOURS OF WAITING WHAT DID THEY DO
WE MUST NEEDS TELL SINCE THIS IS A MATTER OF HISTORY
WHILE THE MEN MADE BULLETS AND THE WOMEN LINT WHILE A LARGE SAUCEPAN
OF MELTED BRASS AND LEAD DESTINED TO THE BULLET MOULD SMOKED OVER A
GLOWING BRAZIER WHILE THE SENTINELS WATCHED WEAPON IN HAND ON THE
BARRICADE WHILE ENJOLRAS WHOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DIVERT KEPT AN
EYE ON THE SENTINELS COMBEFERRE COURFEYRAC JEAN PROUVAIRE FEUILLY
BOSSUET JOLY BAHOREL AND SOME OTHERS SOUGHT EACH OTHER OUT AND
UNITED AS IN THE MOST PEACEFUL DAYS OF THEIR CONVERSATIONS IN THEIR
STUDENT LIFE AND IN ONE CORNER OF THIS WINE SHOP WHICH HAD BEEN
CONVERTED INTO A CASEMENT A COUPLE OF PACES DISTANT FROM THE REDOUBT
WHICH THEY HAD BUILT WITH THEIR CARBINES LOADED AND PRIMED RESTING
AGAINST THE BACKS OF THEIR CHAIRS THESE FINE YOUNG FELLOWS SO CLOSE TO
A SUPREME HOUR BEGAN TO RECITE LOVE VERSES
WHAT VERSES THESE
VOUS RAPPELEZ VOUS NOTRE DOUCE VIE
LORSQUE NOUS ETIONS SI JEUNES TOUS DEUX
ET QUE NOUS N'AVIONS AU COEUR D'AUTRE ENVIE
QUE D'ETRE BIEN MIS ET D'ETRE AMOUREUX
LORSQU'EN AJOUTANT VOTRE AGE A MON AGE
NOUS NE COMPTIONS PAS A DEUX QUARANTE ANS
ET QUE DANS NOTRE HUMBLE ET PETIT MENAGE
TOUT MEME L'HIVER NOUS ETAIT PRINTEMPS
BEAUX JOURS MANUEL ETAIT FIER ET SAGE
PARIS S'ASSEYAIT A DE SAINTS BANQUETS
FOY LANCAIT LA FOUDRE ET VOTRE CORSAGE
AVAIT UNE EPINGLE OU JE ME PIQUAIS
TOUT VOUS CONTEMPLAIT
AVOCAT SANS CAUSES
QUAND JE VOUS MENAIS AU PRADO DINER
VOUS ETIEZ JOLIE AU POINT QUE LES ROSES
ME FAISAIENT L'EFFET DE SE RETOURNER
JE LES ENTENDAIS DIRE EST ELLE BELLE
COMME ELLE SENT BON QUELS CHEVEUX A FLOTS
SOUS SON MANTELET ELLE CACHE UNE AILE
SON BONNET CHARMANT EST A PEINE ECLOS
J'ERRAIS AVEC TOI PRESSANT TON BRAS SOUPLE
LES PASSANTS CROVAIENT QUE L'AMOUR CHARME
AVAIT MARIE DANS NOTRE HEUREUX COUPLE
LE DOUX MOIS D'AVRIL AU BEAU MOIS DE MAI
NOUS VIVIONS CACHES CONTENTS PORTE CLOSE
DEVORANT L'AMOUR BON FRUIT DEFENDU
MA BOUCHE N'AVAIT PAS DIT UNE CHOSE
QUE DEJA TON COEUR AVAIT REPONDU
LA SORBONNE ETAIT L'ENDROIT BUCOLIQUE
OU JE T'ADORAIS DU SOIR AU MATIN
C'EST AINSI QU'UNE AME AMOUREUSE APPLIQUE
LA CARTE DU TENDRE AU PAYS LATIN
O PLACE MAUBERT O PLACE DAUPHINE
QUAND DANS LE TAUDIS FRAIS ET PRINTANIER
TU TIRAIS TON BAS SUR TON JAMBE FINE
JE VOYAIS UN ASTRE AU FOND DU GRENIER
J'AI FORT LU PLATON MAIS RIEN NE M'EN RESTE
MIEUX QUE MALEBRANCHE ET QUE LAMENNAIS
TU ME DEMONTRAIS LA BONTE CELESTE
AVEC UNE FLEUR QUE TU ME DONNAIS
JE T'OBEISSAIS TU M' ETAIS SOUMISE
O GRENIER DORE TE LACER TE VOIR
ALLER ET VENIR DES L'AUBE EN CHEMISE
MIRANT TON JEUNE FRONT A TON VIEUX MIROIR
ET QUI DONE POURRAIT PERDE LA MEMOIRE
DE CES TEMPS D'AURORE ET DE FIRMAMENT
DE RUBANS DE FLEURS DE GAZE ET DE MOIRE
OU L'AMOUR BEGAYE UN ARGOT CHARMANT
NOS JARDINS ETAIENT UN POT DE TULIPE
TU MASQUAIS LA VITRE AVEC UN JUPON
JE PRENAIS LE BOL DE TERRE DE PIPE
ET JE TE DONNAIS LE TASSE EN JAPON
ET CES GRANDS MALHEURS QUI NOUS FAISAIENT RIRE
TON MANCHON BRULE TON BOA PERDU
ET CE CHER PORTRAIT DU DIVIN SHAKESPEARE
QU'UN SOIR POUR SOUPER NONS AVONS VENDU
J'ETAIS MENDIANT ET TOI CHARITABLE
JE BAISAIS AU VOL TES BRAS FRAIS ET RONDS
DANTE IN FOLIO NOUS SERVAIT DE TABLE
POUR MANGER GAIMENT UN CENT DE MARRONS
LA PREMIERE FOIS QU'EN MON JOYEUX BOUGE
JE PRIS UN BAISER A TON LEVRE EN FEU
QUAND TU T'EN ALLAIS DECOIFFEE ET ROUGE
JE RESTAI TOUT PALE ET JE CRUS EN DIEU
TE RAPPELLES TU NOS BONHEURS SANS NOMBRE
ET TOUS CES FICHUS CHANGES EN CHIFFONS
OH QUE DE SOUPIRS DE NOS COEURS PLEINS D'OMBRE
SE SONT ENVOLES DANS LES CIEUX PROFONDS 53
THE HOUR THE SPOT THESE SOUVENIRS OF YOUTH RECALLED A FEW STARS
WHICH BEGAN TO TWINKLE IN THE SKY THE FUNERAL REPOSE OF THOSE DESERTED
STREETS THE IMMINENCE OF THE INEXORABLE ADVENTURE WHICH WAS IN
PREPARATION GAVE A PATHETIC CHARM TO THESE VERSES MURMURED IN A LOW
TONE IN THE DUSK BY JEAN PROUVAIRE WHO AS WE HAVE SAID WAS A GENTLE
POET
IN THE MEANTIME A LAMP HAD BEEN LIGHTED IN THE SMALL BARRICADE AND IN
THE LARGE ONE ONE OF THOSE WAX TORCHES SUCH AS ARE TO BE MET WITH ON
SHROVE TUESDAY IN FRONT OF VEHICLES LOADED WITH MASKS ON THEIR WAY
TO LA COURTILLE
THESE TORCHES AS THE READER HAS SEEN CAME FROM THE
FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE
THE TORCH HAD BEEN PLACED IN A SORT OF CAGE OF PAVING STONES CLOSED ON
THREE SIDES TO SHELTER IT FROM THE WIND AND DISPOSED IN SUCH A FASHION
THAT ALL THE LIGHT FELL ON THE FLAG
THE STREET AND THE BARRICADE
REMAINED SUNK IN GLOOM AND NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN EXCEPT THE RED FLAG
FORMIDABLY ILLUMINATED AS BY AN ENORMOUS DARK LANTERN
THIS LIGHT ENHANCED THE SCARLET OF THE FLAG WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE AND
TERRIBLE PURPLE
CHAPTER VII THE MAN RECRUITED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTES
NIGHT WAS FULLY COME NOTHING MADE ITS APPEARANCE
ALL THAT THEY HEARD
WAS CONFUSED NOISES AND AT INTERVALS FUSILLADES BUT THESE WERE RARE
BADLY SUSTAINED AND DISTANT
THIS RESPITE WHICH WAS THUS PROLONGED
WAS A SIGN THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS TAKING ITS TIME AND COLLECTING ITS
FORCES
THESE FIFTY MEN WERE WAITING FOR SIXTY THOUSAND
ENJOLRAS FELT ATTACKED BY THAT IMPATIENCE WHICH SEIZES ON STRONG SOULS
ON THE THRESHOLD OF REDOUBTABLE EVENTS
HE WENT IN SEARCH OF GAVROCHE
WHO HAD SET TO MAKING CARTRIDGES IN THE TAP ROOM BY THE DUBIOUS LIGHT
OF TWO CANDLES PLACED ON THE COUNTER BY WAY OF PRECAUTION ON ACCOUNT OF
THE POWDER WHICH WAS SCATTERED ON THE TABLES
THESE TWO CANDLES CAST NO
GLEAM OUTSIDE
THE INSURGENTS HAD MOREOVER TAKEN PAINS NOT TO HAVE ANY
LIGHT IN THE UPPER STORIES
GAVROCHE WAS DEEPLY PREOCCUPIED AT THAT MOMENT BUT NOT PRECISELY WITH
HIS CARTRIDGES
THE MAN OF THE RUE DES BILLETTES HAD JUST ENTERED
THE TAP ROOM AND HAD SEATED HIMSELF AT THE TABLE WHICH WAS THE LEAST
LIGHTED
A MUSKET OF LARGE MODEL HAD FALLEN TO HIS SHARE AND HE HELD IT
BETWEEN HIS LEGS
GAVROCHE WHO HAD BEEN UP TO THAT MOMENT DISTRACTED
BY A HUNDRED AMUSING THINGS HAD NOT EVEN SEEN THIS MAN
WHEN HE ENTERED GAVROCHE FOLLOWED HIM MECHANICALLY WITH HIS EYES
ADMIRING HIS GUN THEN ALL AT ONCE WHEN THE MAN WAS SEATED THE STREET
URCHIN SPRANG TO HIS FEET
ANY ONE WHO HAD SPIED UPON THAT MAN UP TO
THAT MOMENT WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT HE WAS OBSERVING EVERYTHING IN THE
BARRICADE AND IN THE BAND OF INSURGENTS WITH SINGULAR ATTENTION BUT
FROM THE MOMENT WHEN HE HAD ENTERED THIS ROOM HE HAD FALLEN INTO A SORT
OF BROWN STUDY AND NO LONGER SEEMED TO SEE ANYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON
THE GAMIN APPROACHED THIS PENSIVE PERSONAGE AND BEGAN TO STEP AROUND
HIM ON TIPTOE AS ONE WALKS IN THE VICINITY OF A PERSON WHOM ONE IS
AFRAID OF WAKING
AT THE SAME TIME OVER HIS CHILDISH COUNTENANCE WHICH
WAS AT ONCE SO IMPUDENT AND SO SERIOUS SO GIDDY AND SO PROFOUND SO
GAY AND SO HEART BREAKING PASSED ALL THOSE GRIMACES OF AN OLD MAN WHICH
SIGNIFY AH BAH IMPOSSIBLE MY SIGHT IS BAD I AM DREAMING CAN THIS
BE NO IT IS NOT BUT YES WHY NO ETC
GAVROCHE BALANCED ON HIS
HEELS CLENCHED BOTH FISTS IN HIS POCKETS MOVED HIS NECK AROUND LIKE A
BIRD EXPENDED IN A GIGANTIC POUT ALL THE SAGACITY OF HIS LOWER LIP
HE
WAS ASTOUNDED UNCERTAIN INCREDULOUS CONVINCED DAZZLED
HE HAD THE
MIEN OF THE CHIEF OF THE EUNUCHS IN THE SLAVE MART DISCOVERING A
VENUS AMONG THE BLOWSY FEMALES AND THE AIR OF AN AMATEUR RECOGNIZING
A RAPHAEL IN A HEAP OF DAUBS
HIS WHOLE BEING WAS AT WORK THE INSTINCT
WHICH SCENTS OUT AND THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH COMBINES
IT WAS EVIDENT
THAT A GREAT EVENT HAD HAPPENED IN GAVROCHE'S LIFE
IT WAS AT THE MOST INTENSE POINT OF THIS PREOCCUPATION THAT ENJOLRAS
ACCOSTED HIM
YOU ARE SMALL SAID ENJOLRAS YOU WILL NOT BE SEEN
GO OUT OF THE
BARRICADE SLIP ALONG CLOSE TO THE HOUSES SKIRMISH ABOUT A BIT IN THE
STREETS AND COME BACK AND TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON
GAVROCHE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS HAUNCHES
SO THE LITTLE CHAPS ARE GOOD FOR SOMETHING THAT'S VERY LUCKY I'LL
GO IN THE MEANWHILE TRUST TO THE LITTLE FELLOWS AND DISTRUST THE BIG
ONES AND GAVROCHE RAISING HIS HEAD AND LOWERING HIS VOICE ADDED
AS HE INDICATED THE MAN OF THE RUE DES BILLETTES DO YOU SEE THAT BIG
FELLOW THERE
WELL
HE'S A POLICE SPY
ARE YOU SURE OF IT
IT ISN'T TWO WEEKS SINCE HE PULLED ME OFF THE CORNICE OF THE PORT
ROYAL WHERE I WAS TAKING THE AIR BY MY EAR
ENJOLRAS HASTILY QUITTED THE URCHIN AND MURMURED A FEW WORDS IN A VERY
LOW TONE TO A LONGSHOREMAN FROM THE WINEDOCKS WHO CHANCED TO BE AT HAND
THE MAN LEFT THE ROOM AND RETURNED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ACCOMPANIED BY
THREE OTHERS
THE FOUR MEN FOUR PORTERS WITH BROAD SHOULDERS WENT
AND PLACED THEMSELVES WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
BEHIND THE TABLE ON WHICH THE MAN OF THE RUE DES BILLETTES WAS LEANING
WITH HIS ELBOWS
THEY WERE EVIDENTLY READY TO HURL THEMSELVES UPON HIM
THEN ENJOLRAS APPROACHED THE MAN AND DEMANDED OF HIM
WHO ARE YOU
AT THIS ABRUPT QUERY THE MAN STARTED
HE PLUNGED HIS GAZE DEEP INTO
ENJOLRAS' CLEAR EYES AND APPEARED TO GRASP THE LATTER'S MEANING
HE
SMILED WITH A SMILE THAN WHICH NOTHING MORE DISDAINFUL MORE ENERGETIC
AND MORE RESOLUTE COULD BE SEEN IN THE WORLD AND REPLIED WITH HAUGHTY
GRAVITY
I SEE WHAT IT IS
WELL YES
YOU ARE A POLICE SPY
I AM AN AGENT OF THE AUTHORITIES
AND YOUR NAME
JAVERT
ENJOLRAS MADE A SIGN TO THE FOUR MEN
IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE BEFORE
JAVERT HAD TIME TO TURN ROUND HE WAS COLLARED THROWN DOWN PINIONED
AND SEARCHED
THEY FOUND ON HIM A LITTLE ROUND CARD PASTED BETWEEN TWO PIECES OF
GLASS AND BEARING ON ONE SIDE THE ARMS OF FRANCE ENGRAVED AND WITH
THIS MOTTO SUPERVISION AND VIGILANCE AND ON THE OTHER THIS NOTE
JAVERT INSPECTOR OF POLICE AGED FIFTY TWO AND THE SIGNATURE OF THE
PREFECT OF POLICE OF THAT DAY M
GISQUET
BESIDES THIS HE HAD HIS WATCH AND HIS PURSE WHICH CONTAINED SEVERAL
GOLD PIECES
THEY LEFT HIM HIS PURSE AND HIS WATCH
UNDER THE WATCH
AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS FOB THEY FELT AND SEIZED A PAPER IN AN ENVELOPE
WHICH ENJOLRAS UNFOLDED AND ON WHICH HE READ THESE FIVE LINES WRITTEN
IN THE VERY HAND OF THE PREFECT OF POLICE
AS SOON AS HIS POLITICAL MISSION IS ACCOMPLISHED INSPECTOR JAVERT
WILL MAKE SURE BY SPECIAL SUPERVISION WHETHER IT IS TRUE THAT THE
MALEFACTORS HAVE INSTITUTED INTRIGUES ON THE RIGHT BANK OF THE SEINE
NEAR THE JENA BRIDGE
THE SEARCH ENDED THEY LIFTED JAVERT TO HIS FEET BOUND HIS ARMS BEHIND
HIS BACK AND FASTENED HIM TO THAT CELEBRATED POST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
ROOM WHICH HAD FORMERLY GIVEN THE WINE SHOP ITS NAME
GAVROCHE WHO HAD LOOKED ON AT THE WHOLE OF THIS SCENE AND HAD APPROVED
OF EVERYTHING WITH A SILENT TOSS OF HIS HEAD STEPPED UP TO JAVERT AND
SAID TO HIM
IT'S THE MOUSE WHO HAS CAUGHT THE CAT
ALL THIS WAS SO RAPIDLY EXECUTED THAT IT WAS ALL OVER WHEN THOSE ABOUT
THE WINE SHOP NOTICED IT
JAVERT HAD NOT UTTERED A SINGLE CRY
AT THE SIGHT OF JAVERT BOUND TO THE POST COURFEYRAC BOSSUET JOLY
COMBEFERRE AND THE MEN SCATTERED OVER THE TWO BARRICADES CAME RUNNING
UP
JAVERT WITH HIS BACK TO THE POST AND SO SURROUNDED WITH ROPES THAT HE
COULD NOT MAKE A MOVEMENT RAISED HIS HEAD WITH THE INTREPID SERENITY OF
THE MAN WHO HAS NEVER LIED
HE IS A POLICE SPY SAID ENJOLRAS
AND TURNING TO JAVERT YOU WILL BE SHOT TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE
BARRICADE IS TAKEN
JAVERT REPLIED IN HIS MOST IMPERIOUS TONE
WHY NOT AT ONCE
WE ARE SAVING OUR POWDER
THEN FINISH THE BUSINESS WITH A BLOW FROM A KNIFE
SPY SAID THE HANDSOME ENJOLRAS WE ARE JUDGES AND NOT ASSASSINS
THEN HE CALLED GAVROCHE
HERE YOU GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS DO WHAT I TOLD YOU
I'M GOING CRIED GAVROCHE
AND HALTING AS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF SETTING OUT
BY THE WAY YOU WILL GIVE ME HIS GUN AND HE ADDED I LEAVE YOU THE
MUSICIAN BUT I WANT THE CLARIONET
THE GAMIN MADE THE MILITARY SALUTE AND PASSED GAYLY THROUGH THE OPENING
IN THE LARGE BARRICADE
CHAPTER VIII MANY INTERROGATION POINTS WITH REGARD TO A CERTAIN LE
CABUC WHOSE NAME MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LE CABUC
THE TRAGIC PICTURE WHICH WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE THE
READER WOULD NOT SEE THOSE GRAND MOMENTS OF SOCIAL BIRTH PANGS IN A
REVOLUTIONARY BIRTH WHICH CONTAIN CONVULSION MINGLED WITH EFFORT
IN THEIR EXACT AND REAL RELIEF WERE WE TO OMIT IN THE SKETCH HERE
OUTLINED AN INCIDENT FULL OF EPIC AND SAVAGE HORROR WHICH OCCURRED
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER GAVROCHE'S DEPARTURE
MOBS AS THE READER KNOWS ARE LIKE A SNOWBALL AND COLLECT AS THEY
ROLL ALONG A THRONG OF TUMULTUOUS MEN
THESE MEN DO NOT ASK EACH OTHER
WHENCE THEY COME
AMONG THE PASSERS BY WHO HAD JOINED THE RABBLE LED BY
ENJOLRAS COMBEFERRE AND COURFEYRAC THERE HAD BEEN A PERSON WEARING
THE JACKET OF A STREET PORTER WHICH WAS VERY THREADBARE ON THE
SHOULDERS WHO GESTICULATED AND VOCIFERATED AND WHO HAD THE LOOK OF A
DRUNKEN SAVAGE
THIS MAN WHOSE NAME OR NICKNAME WAS LE CABUC AND WHO
WAS MOREOVER AN UTTER STRANGER TO THOSE WHO PRETENDED TO KNOW HIM
WAS VERY DRUNK OR ASSUMED THE APPEARANCE OF BEING SO AND HAD SEATED
HIMSELF WITH SEVERAL OTHERS AT A TABLE WHICH THEY HAD DRAGGED OUTSIDE
OF THE WINE SHOP
THIS CABUC WHILE MAKING THOSE WHO VIED WITH HIM DRUNK
SEEMED TO BE EXAMINING WITH A THOUGHTFUL AIR THE LARGE HOUSE AT THE
EXTREMITY OF THE BARRICADE WHOSE FIVE STORIES COMMANDED THE WHOLE
STREET AND FACED THE RUE SAINT DENIS
ALL AT ONCE HE EXCLAIMED
DO YOU KNOW COMRADES IT IS FROM THAT HOUSE YONDER THAT WE MUST FIRE
WHEN WE ARE AT THE WINDOWS THE DEUCE IS IN IT IF ANY ONE CAN ADVANCE
INTO THE STREET
YES BUT THE HOUSE IS CLOSED SAID ONE OF THE DRINKERS
LET US KNOCK
THEY WILL NOT OPEN
LET US BREAK IN THE DOOR
LE CABUC RUNS TO THE DOOR WHICH HAD A VERY MASSIVE KNOCKER AND KNOCKS
THE DOOR OPENS NOT
HE STRIKES A SECOND BLOW
NO ONE ANSWERS
A THIRD
STROKE
THE SAME SILENCE
IS THERE ANY ONE HERE SHOUTS CABUC
NOTHING STIRS
THEN HE SEIZES A GUN AND BEGINS TO BATTER THE DOOR WITH THE BUTT END
IT WAS AN ANCIENT ALLEY DOOR LOW VAULTED NARROW SOLID ENTIRELY OF
OAK LINED ON THE INSIDE WITH A SHEET OF IRON AND IRON STAYS A GENUINE
PRISON POSTERN
THE BLOWS FROM THE BUTT END OF THE GUN MADE THE HOUSE
TREMBLE BUT DID NOT SHAKE THE DOOR
NEVERTHELESS IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE INHABITANTS WERE DISTURBED FOR A
TINY SQUARE WINDOW WAS FINALLY SEEN TO OPEN ON THE THIRD STORY AND AT
THIS APERTURE APPEARED THE REVEREND AND TERRIFIED FACE OF A GRAY HAIRED
OLD MAN WHO WAS THE PORTER AND WHO HELD A CANDLE
THE MAN WHO WAS KNOCKING PAUSED
GENTLEMEN SAID THE PORTER WHAT DO YOU WANT
OPEN SAID CABUC
THAT CANNOT BE GENTLEMEN
OPEN NEVERTHELESS
IMPOSSIBLE GENTLEMEN
LE CABUC TOOK HIS GUN AND AIMED AT THE PORTER BUT AS HE WAS BELOW AND
AS IT WAS VERY DARK THE PORTER DID NOT SEE HIM
WILL YOU OPEN YES OR NO
NO GENTLEMEN
DO YOU SAY NO
I SAY NO MY GOO
THE PORTER DID NOT FINISH
THE SHOT WAS FIRED THE BALL ENTERED UNDER
HIS CHIN AND CAME OUT AT THE NAPE OF HIS NECK AFTER TRAVERSING THE
JUGULAR VEIN
THE OLD MAN FELL BACK WITHOUT A SIGH
THE CANDLE FELL AND WAS
EXTINGUISHED AND NOTHING MORE WAS TO BE SEEN EXCEPT A MOTIONLESS HEAD
LYING ON THE SILL OF THE SMALL WINDOW AND A LITTLE WHITISH SMOKE WHICH
FLOATED OFF TOWARDS THE ROOF
THERE SAID LE CABUC DROPPING THE BUTT END OF HIS GUN TO THE
PAVEMENT
HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THIS WORD WHEN HE FELT A HAND LAID ON HIS
SHOULDER WITH THE WEIGHT OF AN EAGLE'S TALON AND HE HEARD A VOICE
SAYING TO HIM
ON YOUR KNEES
THE MURDERER TURNED ROUND AND SAW BEFORE HIM ENJOLRAS' COLD WHITE FACE
ENJOLRAS HELD A PISTOL IN HIS HAND
HE HAD HASTENED UP AT THE SOUND OF THE DISCHARGE
HE HAD SEIZED CABUC'S COLLAR BLOUSE SHIRT AND SUSPENDER WITH HIS LEFT
HAND
ON YOUR KNEES HE REPEATED
AND WITH AN IMPERIOUS MOTION THE FRAIL YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY YEARS BENT
THE THICKSET AND STURDY PORTER LIKE A REED AND BROUGHT HIM TO HIS KNEES
IN THE MIRE
LE CABUC ATTEMPTED TO RESIST BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY A
SUPERHUMAN HAND
ENJOLRAS PALE WITH BARE NECK AND DISHEVELLED HAIR AND HIS WOMAN'S
FACE HAD ABOUT HIM AT THAT MOMENT SOMETHING OF THE ANTIQUE THEMIS
HIS DILATED NOSTRILS HIS DOWNCAST EYES GAVE TO HIS IMPLACABLE GREEK
PROFILE THAT EXPRESSION OF WRATH AND THAT EXPRESSION OF CHASTITY WHICH
AS THE ANCIENT WORLD VIEWED THE MATTER BEFIT JUSTICE
THE WHOLE BARRICADE HASTENED UP THEN ALL RANGED THEMSELVES IN A CIRCLE
AT A DISTANCE FEELING THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO UTTER A WORD IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE THING WHICH THEY WERE ABOUT TO BEHOLD
LE CABUC VANQUISHED NO LONGER TRIED TO STRUGGLE AND TREMBLED IN EVERY
LIMB
ENJOLRAS RELEASED HIM AND DREW OUT HIS WATCH
COLLECT YOURSELF SAID HE
THINK OR PRAY
YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE
MERCY MURMURED THE MURDERER THEN HE DROPPED HIS HEAD AND STAMMERED A
FEW INARTICULATE OATHS
ENJOLRAS NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF OF HIM HE ALLOWED A MINUTE TO PASS
THEN HE REPLACED HIS WATCH IN HIS FOB
THAT DONE HE GRASPED LE CABUC
BY THE HAIR AS THE LATTER COILED HIMSELF INTO A BALL AT HIS KNEES AND
SHRIEKED AND PLACED THE MUZZLE OF THE PISTOL TO HIS EAR
MANY OF THOSE
INTREPID MEN WHO HAD SO TRANQUILLY ENTERED UPON THE MOST TERRIBLE OF
ADVENTURES TURNED ASIDE THEIR HEADS
AN EXPLOSION WAS HEARD THE ASSASSIN FELL TO THE PAVEMENT FACE
DOWNWARDS
ENJOLRAS STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AND CAST A CONVINCED AND SEVERE GLANCE
AROUND HIM
THEN HE SPURNED THE CORPSE WITH HIS FOOT AND SAID
THROW THAT OUTSIDE
THREE MEN RAISED THE BODY OF THE UNHAPPY WRETCH WHICH WAS STILL
AGITATED BY THE LAST MECHANICAL CONVULSIONS OF THE LIFE THAT HAD FLED
AND FLUNG IT OVER THE LITTLE BARRICADE INTO THE RUE MONDETOUR
ENJOLRAS WAS THOUGHTFUL
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT GRANDIOSE SHADOWS
SLOWLY SPREAD OVER HIS REDOUBTABLE SERENITY
ALL AT ONCE HE RAISED HIS
VOICE
A SILENCE FELL UPON THEM
CITIZENS SAID ENJOLRAS WHAT THAT MAN DID IS FRIGHTFUL WHAT I HAVE
DONE IS HORRIBLE
HE KILLED THEREFORE I KILLED HIM
I HAD TO DO IT
BECAUSE INSURRECTION MUST HAVE ITS DISCIPLINE
ASSASSINATION IS EVEN
MORE OF A CRIME HERE THAN ELSEWHERE WE ARE UNDER THE EYES OF THE
REVOLUTION WE ARE THE PRIESTS OF THE REPUBLIC WE ARE THE VICTIMS OF
DUTY AND MUST NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SLANDER OUR COMBAT
I HAVE THEREFORE
TRIED THAT MAN AND CONDEMNED HIM TO DEATH
AS FOR MYSELF CONSTRAINED
AS I AM TO DO WHAT I HAVE DONE AND YET ABHORRING IT I HAVE JUDGED
MYSELF ALSO AND YOU SHALL SOON SEE TO WHAT I HAVE CONDEMNED MYSELF
THOSE WHO LISTENED TO HIM SHUDDERED
WE WILL SHARE THY FATE CRIED COMBEFERRE
SO BE IT REPLIED ENJOLRAS
ONE WORD MORE
IN EXECUTING THIS MAN
I HAVE OBEYED NECESSITY BUT NECESSITY IS A MONSTER OF THE OLD WORLD
NECESSITY'S NAME IS FATALITY
NOW THE LAW OF PROGRESS IS THAT MONSTERS
SHALL DISAPPEAR BEFORE THE ANGELS AND THAT FATALITY SHALL VANISH BEFORE
FRATERNITY
IT IS A BAD MOMENT TO PRONOUNCE THE WORD LOVE
NO MATTER I
DO PRONOUNCE IT
AND I GLORIFY IT
LOVE THE FUTURE IS THINE
DEATH I
MAKE USE OF THEE BUT I HATE THEE
CITIZENS IN THE FUTURE THERE WILL
BE NEITHER DARKNESS NOR THUNDERBOLTS NEITHER FEROCIOUS IGNORANCE NOR
BLOODY RETALIATION
AS THERE WILL BE NO MORE SATAN THERE WILL BE NO
MORE MICHAEL
IN THE FUTURE NO ONE WILL KILL ANY ONE ELSE THE EARTH
WILL BEAM WITH RADIANCE THE HUMAN RACE WILL LOVE
THE DAY WILL COME
CITIZENS WHEN ALL WILL BE CONCORD HARMONY LIGHT JOY AND LIFE IT
WILL COME AND IT IS IN ORDER THAT IT MAY COME THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO
DIE
ENJOLRAS CEASED
HIS VIRGIN LIPS CLOSED AND HE REMAINED FOR SOME TIME
STANDING ON THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD SHED BLOOD IN MARBLE IMMOBILITY
HIS
STARING EYE CAUSED THOSE ABOUT HIM TO SPEAK IN LOW TONES
JEAN PROUVAIRE AND COMBEFERRE PRESSED EACH OTHER'S HANDS SILENTLY AND
LEANING AGAINST EACH OTHER IN AN ANGLE OF THE BARRICADE THEY WATCHED
WITH AN ADMIRATION IN WHICH THERE WAS SOME COMPASSION THAT GRAVE YOUNG
MAN EXECUTIONER AND PRIEST COMPOSED OF LIGHT LIKE CRYSTAL AND ALSO
OF ROCK
LET US SAY AT ONCE THAT LATER ON AFTER THE ACTION WHEN THE BODIES WERE
TAKEN TO THE MORGUE AND SEARCHED A POLICE AGENT'S CARD WAS FOUND ON LE
CABUC
THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK HAD IN HIS HANDS IN 1848 THE SPECIAL
REPORT ON THIS SUBJECT MADE TO THE PREFECT OF POLICE IN 1832
WE WILL ADD THAT IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE A TRADITION OF THE POLICE WHICH
IS STRANGE BUT PROBABLY WELL FOUNDED LE CABUC WAS CLAQUESOUS
THE FACT
IS THAT DATING FROM THE DEATH OF LE CABUC THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY
QUESTION OF CLAQUESOUS
CLAQUESOUS HAD NOWHERE LEFT ANY TRACE OF HIS
DISAPPEARANCE HE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE AMALGAMATED HIMSELF WITH THE
INVISIBLE
HIS LIFE HAD BEEN ALL SHADOWS HIS END WAS NIGHT
THE WHOLE INSURGENT GROUP WAS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE EMOTION
OF THAT TRAGIC CASE WHICH HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY TRIED AND SO QUICKLY
TERMINATED WHEN COURFEYRAC AGAIN BEHELD ON THE BARRICADE THE SMALL
YOUNG MAN WHO HAD INQUIRED OF HIM THAT MORNING FOR MARIUS
THIS LAD WHO HAD A BOLD AND RECKLESS AIR HAD COME BY NIGHT TO JOIN THE
INSURGENTS
BOOK THIRTEENTH MARIUS ENTERS THE SHADOW
CHAPTER I FROM THE RUE PLUMET TO THE QUARTIER SAINT DENIS
THE VOICE WHICH HAD SUMMONED MARIUS THROUGH THE TWILIGHT TO THE
BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE HAD PRODUCED ON HIM THE EFFECT
OF THE VOICE OF DESTINY
HE WISHED TO DIE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED
ITSELF HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE TOMB A HAND IN THE DARKNESS
OFFERED HIM THE KEY
THESE MELANCHOLY OPENINGS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE
GLOOM BEFORE DESPAIR ARE TEMPTING
MARIUS THRUST ASIDE THE BAR WHICH
HAD SO OFTEN ALLOWED HIM TO PASS EMERGED FROM THE GARDEN AND SAID I
WILL GO
MAD WITH GRIEF NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING FIXED OR SOLID IN HIS
BRAIN INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING ANYTHING THENCEFORTH OF FATE AFTER THOSE
TWO MONTHS PASSED IN THE INTOXICATION OF YOUTH AND LOVE OVERWHELMED AT
ONCE BY ALL THE REVERIES OF DESPAIR HE HAD BUT ONE DESIRE REMAINING TO
MAKE A SPEEDY END OF ALL
HE SET OUT AT RAPID PACE
HE FOUND HIMSELF MOST OPPORTUNELY ARMED AS HE
HAD JAVERT'S PISTOLS WITH HIM
THE YOUNG MAN OF WHOM HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE HAD
VANISHED FROM HIS SIGHT IN THE STREET
MARIUS WHO HAD EMERGED FROM THE RUE PLUMET BY THE BOULEVARD TRAVERSED
THE ESPLANADE AND THE BRIDGE OF THE INVALIDES THE CHAMPS ELYSEES THE
PLACE LOUIS XV AND REACHED THE RUE DE RIVOLI
THE SHOPS WERE OPEN
THERE THE GAS WAS BURNING UNDER THE ARCADES WOMEN WERE MAKING THEIR
PURCHASES IN THE STALLS PEOPLE WERE EATING ICES IN THE CAFE LAITER
AND NIBBLING SMALL CAKES AT THE ENGLISH PASTRY COOK'S SHOP
ONLY A FEW
POSTING CHAISES WERE SETTING OUT AT A GALLOP FROM THE HOTEL DES PRINCES
AND THE HOTEL MEURICE
MARIUS ENTERED THE RUE SAINT HONORE THROUGH THE PASSAGE DELORME
THERE
THE SHOPS WERE CLOSED THE MERCHANTS WERE CHATTING IN FRONT OF THEIR
HALF OPEN DOORS PEOPLE WERE WALKING ABOUT THE STREET LANTERNS WERE
LIGHTED BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST FLOOR ALL THE WINDOWS WERE LIGHTED AS
USUAL
THERE WAS CAVALRY ON THE PLACE DU PALAIS ROYAL
MARIUS FOLLOWED THE RUE SAINT HONORE
IN PROPORTION AS HE LEFT THE
PALAIS ROYAL BEHIND HIM THERE WERE FEWER LIGHTED WINDOWS THE SHOPS
WERE FAST SHUT NO ONE WAS CHATTING ON THE THRESHOLDS THE STREET GREW
SOMBRE AND AT THE SAME TIME THE CROWD INCREASED IN DENSITY
FOR THE
PASSERS BY NOW AMOUNTED TO A CROWD
NO ONE COULD BE SEEN TO SPEAK IN
THIS THRONG AND YET THERE AROSE FROM IT A DULL DEEP MURMUR
NEAR THE FOUNTAIN OF THE ARBRE SEC THERE WERE ASSEMBLAGES MOTIONLESS
AND GLOOMY GROUPS WHICH WERE TO THOSE WHO WENT AND CAME AS STONES IN THE
MIDST OF RUNNING WATER
AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE DES PROUVAIRES THE CROWD NO LONGER WALKED
IT FORMED A RESISTING MASSIVE SOLID COMPACT ALMOST IMPENETRABLE
BLOCK OF PEOPLE WHO WERE HUDDLED TOGETHER AND CONVERSING IN LOW TONES
THERE WERE HARDLY ANY BLACK COATS OR ROUND HATS NOW BUT SMOCK FROCKS
BLOUSES CAPS AND BRISTLING AND CADAVEROUS HEADS
THIS MULTITUDE
UNDULATED CONFUSEDLY IN THE NOCTURNAL GLOOM
ITS WHISPERINGS HAD THE
HOARSE ACCENT OF A VIBRATION
ALTHOUGH NOT ONE OF THEM WAS WALKING A
DULL TRAMPLING WAS AUDIBLE IN THE MIRE
BEYOND THIS DENSE PORTION OF
THE THRONG IN THE RUE DU ROULE IN THE RUE DES PROUVAIRES AND IN THE
EXTENSION OF THE RUE SAINT HONORE THERE WAS NO LONGER A SINGLE WINDOW
IN WHICH A CANDLE WAS BURNING
ONLY THE SOLITARY AND DIMINISHING ROWS
OF LANTERNS COULD BE SEEN VANISHING INTO THE STREET IN THE DISTANCE
THE
LANTERNS OF THAT DATE RESEMBLED LARGE RED STARS HANGING TO ROPES AND
SHED UPON THE PAVEMENT A SHADOW WHICH HAD THE FORM OF A HUGE SPIDER
THESE STREETS WERE NOT DESERTED
THERE COULD BE DESCRIED PILES OF GUNS
MOVING BAYONETS AND TROOPS BIVOUACKING
NO CURIOUS OBSERVER PASSED THAT
LIMIT
THERE CIRCULATION CEASED
THERE THE RABBLE ENDED AND THE ARMY
BEGAN
MARIUS WILLED WITH THE WILL OF A MAN WHO HOPES NO MORE
HE HAD BEEN
SUMMONED HE MUST GO
HE FOUND A MEANS TO TRAVERSE THE THRONG AND TO
PASS THE BIVOUAC OF THE TROOPS HE SHUNNED THE PATROLS HE AVOIDED THE
SENTINELS
HE MADE A CIRCUIT REACHED THE RUE DE BETHISY AND DIRECTED
HIS COURSE TOWARDS THE HALLES
AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DES BOURDONNAIS
THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY LANTERNS
AFTER HAVING PASSED THE ZONE OF THE CROWD HE HAD PASSED THE LIMITS OF
THE TROOPS HE FOUND HIMSELF IN SOMETHING STARTLING
THERE WAS NO LONGER
A PASSER BY NO LONGER A SOLDIER NO LONGER A LIGHT THERE WAS NO ONE
SOLITUDE SILENCE NIGHT I KNOW NOT WHAT CHILL WHICH SEIZED HOLD UPON
ONE
ENTERING A STREET WAS LIKE ENTERING A CELLAR
HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE
HE TOOK A FEW STEPS
SOME ONE PASSED CLOSE TO HIM AT A RUN
WAS IT A
MAN OR A WOMAN WERE THERE MANY OF THEM HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD
IT HAD
PASSED AND VANISHED
PROCEEDING FROM CIRCUIT TO CIRCUIT HE REACHED A LANE WHICH HE JUDGED
TO BE THE RUE DE LA POTERIE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THIS STREET HE CAME IN
CONTACT WITH AN OBSTACLE
HE EXTENDED HIS HANDS
IT WAS AN OVERTURNED
WAGON HIS FOOT RECOGNIZED POOLS OF WATER GULLIES AND PAVING STONES
SCATTERED AND PILED UP
A BARRICADE HAD BEEN BEGUN THERE AND ABANDONED
HE CLIMBED OVER THE STONES AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
BARRIER
HE WALKED VERY NEAR THE STREET POSTS AND GUIDED HIMSELF ALONG
THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES
A LITTLE BEYOND THE BARRICADE IT SEEMED TO HIM
THAT HE COULD MAKE OUT SOMETHING WHITE IN FRONT OF HIM
HE APPROACHED
IT TOOK ON A FORM
IT WAS TWO WHITE HORSES THE HORSES OF THE OMNIBUS
HARNESSED BY BOSSUET IN THE MORNING WHO HAD BEEN STRAYING AT RANDOM ALL
DAY FROM STREET TO STREET AND HAD FINALLY HALTED THERE WITH THE WEARY
PATIENCE OF BRUTES WHO NO MORE UNDERSTAND THE ACTIONS OF MEN THAN MAN
UNDERSTANDS THE ACTIONS OF PROVIDENCE
MARIUS LEFT THE HORSES BEHIND HIM
AS HE WAS APPROACHING A STREET WHICH
SEEMED TO HIM TO BE THE RUE DU CONTRAT SOCIAL A SHOT COMING NO ONE
KNOWS WHENCE AND TRAVERSING THE DARKNESS AT RANDOM WHISTLED CLOSE BY
HIM AND THE BULLET PIERCED A BRASS SHAVING DISH SUSPENDED ABOVE HIS
HEAD OVER A HAIRDRESSER'S SHOP
THIS PIERCED SHAVING DISH WAS STILL
TO BE SEEN IN 1848 IN THE RUE DU CONTRAT SOCIAL AT THE CORNER OF THE
PILLARS OF THE MARKET
THIS SHOT STILL BETOKENED LIFE
FROM THAT INSTANT FORTH HE ENCOUNTERED
NOTHING MORE
THE WHOLE OF THIS ITINERARY RESEMBLED A DESCENT OF BLACK STEPS
NEVERTHELESS MARIUS PRESSED FORWARD
CHAPTER II AN OWL'S VIEW OF PARIS
A BEING WHO COULD HAVE HOVERED OVER PARIS THAT NIGHT WITH THE WING OF
THE BAT OR THE OWL WOULD HAVE HAD BENEATH HIS EYES A GLOOMY SPECTACLE
ALL THAT OLD QUARTER OF THE HALLES WHICH IS LIKE A CITY WITHIN A
CITY THROUGH WHICH RUN THE RUES SAINT DENIS AND SAINT MARTIN WHERE A
THOUSAND LANES CROSS AND OF WHICH THE INSURGENTS HAD MADE THEIR
REDOUBT AND THEIR STRONGHOLD WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO HIM LIKE A DARK AND
ENORMOUS CAVITY HOLLOWED OUT IN THE CENTRE OF PARIS
THERE THE GLANCE
FELL INTO AN ABYSS
THANKS TO THE BROKEN LANTERNS THANKS TO THE CLOSED
WINDOWS THERE ALL RADIANCE ALL LIFE ALL SOUND ALL MOVEMENT CEASED
THE INVISIBLE POLICE OF THE INSURRECTION WERE ON THE WATCH EVERYWHERE
AND MAINTAINED ORDER THAT IS TO SAY NIGHT
THE NECESSARY TACTICS OF
INSURRECTION ARE TO DROWN SMALL NUMBERS IN A VAST OBSCURITY TO MULTIPLY
EVERY COMBATANT BY THE POSSIBILITIES WHICH THAT OBSCURITY CONTAINS
AT
DUSK EVERY WINDOW WHERE A CANDLE WAS BURNING RECEIVED A SHOT
THE LIGHT
WAS EXTINGUISHED SOMETIMES THE INHABITANT WAS KILLED
HENCE NOTHING WAS
STIRRING
THERE WAS NOTHING BUT FRIGHT MOURNING STUPOR IN THE HOUSES
AND IN THE STREETS A SORT OF SACRED HORROR
NOT EVEN THE LONG ROWS OF
WINDOWS AND STORES THE INDENTATIONS OF THE CHIMNEYS AND THE ROOFS
AND THE VAGUE REFLECTIONS WHICH ARE CAST BACK BY THE WET AND MUDDY
PAVEMENTS WERE VISIBLE
AN EYE CAST UPWARD AT THAT MASS OF SHADOWS
MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE HERE AND THERE AT INTERVALS
OF INDISTINCT GLEAMS WHICH BROUGHT OUT BROKEN AND ECCENTRIC LINES AND
PROFILES OF SINGULAR BUILDINGS SOMETHING LIKE THE LIGHTS WHICH GO AND
COME IN RUINS IT WAS AT SUCH POINTS THAT THE BARRICADES WERE SITUATED
THE REST WAS A LAKE OF OBSCURITY FOGGY HEAVY AND FUNEREAL ABOVE
WHICH IN MOTIONLESS AND MELANCHOLY OUTLINES ROSE THE TOWER OF
SAINT JACQUES THE CHURCH OF SAINT MERRY AND TWO OR THREE MORE OF THOSE
GRAND EDIFICES OF WHICH MAN MAKES GIANTS AND THE NIGHT MAKES PHANTOMS
ALL AROUND THIS DESERTED AND DISQUIETING LABYRINTH IN THE QUARTERS
WHERE THE PARISIAN CIRCULATION HAD NOT BEEN ANNIHILATED AND WHERE A
FEW STREET LANTERNS STILL BURNED THE AERIAL OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE
DISTINGUISHED THE METALLIC GLEAM OF SWORDS AND BAYONETS THE DULL RUMBLE
OF ARTILLERY AND THE SWARMING OF SILENT BATTALIONS WHOSE RANKS WERE
SWELLING FROM MINUTE TO MINUTE A FORMIDABLE GIRDLE WHICH WAS SLOWLY
DRAWING IN AND AROUND THE INSURRECTION
THE INVESTED QUARTER WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE THAN A MONSTROUS
CAVERN EVERYTHING THERE APPEARED TO BE ASLEEP OR MOTIONLESS AND AS WE
HAVE JUST SEEN ANY STREET WHICH ONE MIGHT COME TO OFFERED NOTHING BUT
DARKNESS
A WILD DARKNESS FULL OF TRAPS FULL OF UNSEEN AND FORMIDABLE SHOCKS
INTO WHICH IT WAS ALARMING TO PENETRATE AND IN WHICH IT WAS TERRIBLE TO
REMAIN WHERE THOSE WHO ENTERED SHIVERED BEFORE THOSE WHOM THEY AWAITED
WHERE THOSE WHO WAITED SHUDDERED BEFORE THOSE WHO WERE COMING
INVISIBLE
COMBATANTS WERE ENTRENCHED AT EVERY CORNER OF THE STREET SNARES OF THE
SEPULCHRE CONCEALED IN THE DENSITY OF NIGHT
ALL WAS OVER
NO MORE
LIGHT WAS TO BE HOPED FOR HENCEFORTH EXCEPT THE LIGHTNING OF GUNS
NO FURTHER ENCOUNTER EXCEPT THE ABRUPT AND RAPID APPARITION OF DEATH
WHERE HOW WHEN NO ONE KNEW BUT IT WAS CERTAIN AND INEVITABLE
IN
THIS PLACE WHICH HAD BEEN MARKED OUT FOR THE STRUGGLE THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE INSURRECTION THE NATIONAL GUARD AND POPULAR SOCIETIES THE
BOURGEOIS AND THE UPRISING GROPING THEIR WAY WERE ABOUT TO COME INTO
CONTACT
THE NECESSITY WAS THE SAME FOR BOTH
THE ONLY POSSIBLE ISSUE
THENCEFORTH WAS TO EMERGE THENCE KILLED OR CONQUERORS
A SITUATION SO
EXTREME AN OBSCURITY SO POWERFUL THAT THE MOST TIMID FELT THEMSELVES
SEIZED WITH RESOLUTION AND THE MOST DARING WITH TERROR
MOREOVER ON BOTH SIDES THE FURY THE RAGE AND THE DETERMINATION WERE
EQUAL
FOR THE ONE PARTY TO ADVANCE MEANT DEATH AND NO ONE DREAMED OF
RETREATING FOR THE OTHER TO REMAIN MEANT DEATH AND NO ONE DREAMED OF
FLIGHT
IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT ALL SHOULD BE ENDED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THAT
TRIUMPH SHOULD REST EITHER HERE OR THERE THAT THE INSURRECTION SHOULD
PROVE ITSELF A REVOLUTION OR A SKIRMISH
THE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THIS
AS WELL AS THE PARTIES THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT BOURGEOIS FELT IT
HENCE
A THOUGHT OF ANGUISH WHICH MINGLED WITH THE IMPENETRABLE GLOOM OF THIS
QUARTER WHERE ALL WAS AT THE POINT OF BEING DECIDED HENCE A REDOUBLED
ANXIETY AROUND THAT SILENCE WHENCE A CATASTROPHE WAS ON THE POINT OF
EMERGING
HERE ONLY ONE SOUND WAS AUDIBLE A SOUND AS HEART RENDING
AS THE DEATH RATTLE AS MENACING AS A MALEDICTION THE TOCSIN OF
SAINT MERRY
NOTHING COULD BE MORE BLOOD CURDLING THAN THE CLAMOR OF
THAT WILD AND DESPERATE BELL WAILING AMID THE SHADOWS
AS IT OFTEN HAPPENS NATURE SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN INTO ACCORD WITH WHAT
MEN WERE ABOUT TO DO
NOTHING DISTURBED THE HARMONY OF THE WHOLE EFFECT
THE STARS HAD DISAPPEARED HEAVY CLOUDS FILLED THE HORIZON WITH THEIR
MELANCHOLY FOLDS
A BLACK SKY RESTED ON THESE DEAD STREETS AS THOUGH AN
IMMENSE WINDING SHEET WERE BEING OUTSPREAD OVER THIS IMMENSE TOMB
WHILE A BATTLE THAT WAS STILL WHOLLY POLITICAL WAS IN PREPARATION IN THE
SAME LOCALITY WHICH HAD ALREADY WITNESSED SO MANY REVOLUTIONARY EVENTS
WHILE YOUTH THE SECRET ASSOCIATIONS THE SCHOOLS IN THE NAME OF
PRINCIPLES AND THE MIDDLE CLASSES IN THE NAME OF INTERESTS WERE
APPROACHING PREPARATORY TO DASHING THEMSELVES TOGETHER CLASPING AND
THROWING EACH OTHER WHILE EACH ONE HASTENED AND INVITED THE LAST AND
DECISIVE HOUR OF THE CRISIS FAR AWAY AND QUITE OUTSIDE OF THIS FATAL
QUARTER IN THE MOST PROFOUND DEPTHS OF THE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES OF
THAT WRETCHED OLD PARIS WHICH DISAPPEARS UNDER THE SPLENDOR OF HAPPY
AND OPULENT PARIS THE SOMBRE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE COULD BE HEARD GIVING
UTTERANCE TO A DULL ROAR
A FEARFUL AND SACRED VOICE WHICH IS COMPOSED OF THE ROAR OF THE BRUTE
AND OF THE WORD OF GOD WHICH TERRIFIES THE WEAK AND WHICH WARNS THE
WISE WHICH COMES BOTH FROM BELOW LIKE THE VOICE OF THE LION AND FROM
ON HIGH LIKE THE VOICE OF THE THUNDER
CHAPTER III THE EXTREME EDGE
MARIUS HAD REACHED THE HALLES
THERE EVERYTHING WAS STILL CALMER MORE OBSCURE AND MORE MOTIONLESS THAN
IN THE NEIGHBORING STREETS
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE GLACIAL PEACE
OF THE SEPULCHRE HAD SPRUNG FORTH FROM THE EARTH AND HAD SPREAD OVER THE
HEAVENS
NEVERTHELESS A RED GLOW BROUGHT OUT AGAINST THIS BLACK BACKGROUND THE
LOFTY ROOFS OF THE HOUSES WHICH BARRED THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE ON
THE SAINT EUSTACHE SIDE
IT WAS THE REFLECTION OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS
BURNING IN THE CORINTHE BARRICADE
MARIUS DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS
THAT RED LIGHT
IT HAD DRAWN HIM TO THE MARCHE AUX POIREES AND HE
CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE DARK MOUTH OF THE RUE DES PRECHEURS
HE ENTERED
IT
THE INSURGENTS' SENTINEL WHO WAS GUARDING THE OTHER END DID NOT
SEE HIM
HE FELT THAT HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO THAT WHICH HE HAD COME IN
SEARCH OF AND HE WALKED ON TIPTOE
IN THIS MANNER HE REACHED THE ELBOW
OF THAT SHORT SECTION OF THE RUE MONDETOUR WHICH WAS AS THE READER WILL
REMEMBER THE ONLY COMMUNICATION WHICH ENJOLRAS HAD PRESERVED WITH THE
OUTSIDE WORLD
AT THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE ON HIS LEFT HE THRUST
HIS HEAD FORWARD AND LOOKED INTO THE FRAGMENT OF THE RUE MONDETOUR
A LITTLE BEYOND THE ANGLE OF THE LANE AND THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE WHICH
CAST A BROAD CURTAIN OF SHADOW IN WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ENGULFED
HE PERCEIVED SOME LIGHT ON THE PAVEMENT A BIT OF THE WINE SHOP AND
BEYOND A FLICKERING LAMP WITHIN A SORT OF SHAPELESS WALL AND MEN
CROUCHING DOWN WITH GUNS ON THEIR KNEES
ALL THIS WAS TEN FATHOMS
DISTANT FROM HIM
IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE
THE HOUSES WHICH BORDERED THE LANE ON THE RIGHT CONCEALED THE REST OF
THE WINE SHOP THE LARGE BARRICADE AND THE FLAG FROM HIM
MARIUS HAD BUT A STEP MORE TO TAKE
THEN THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN SEATED HIMSELF ON A POST FOLDED HIS ARMS
AND FELL TO THINKING ABOUT HIS FATHER
HE THOUGHT OF THAT HEROIC COLONEL PONTMERCY WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD A
SOLDIER WHO HAD GUARDED THE FRONTIER OF FRANCE UNDER THE REPUBLIC AND
HAD TOUCHED THE FRONTIER OF ASIA UNDER NAPOLEON WHO HAD BEHELD GENOA
ALEXANDRIA MILAN TURIN MADRID VIENNA DRESDEN BERLIN MOSCOW WHO
HAD LEFT ON ALL THE VICTORIOUS BATTLE FIELDS OF EUROPE DROPS OF THAT
SAME BLOOD WHICH HE MARIUS HAD IN HIS VEINS WHO HAD GROWN GRAY
BEFORE HIS TIME IN DISCIPLINE AND COMMAND WHO HAD LIVED WITH HIS
SWORD BELT BUCKLED HIS EPAULETS FALLING ON HIS BREAST HIS COCKADE
BLACKENED WITH POWDER HIS BROW FURROWED WITH HIS HELMET IN BARRACKS
IN CAMP IN THE BIVOUAC IN AMBULANCES AND WHO AT THE EXPIRATION OF
TWENTY YEARS HAD RETURNED FROM THE GREAT WARS WITH A SCARRED CHEEK A
SMILING COUNTENANCE TRANQUIL ADMIRABLE PURE AS A CHILD HAVING DONE
EVERYTHING FOR FRANCE AND NOTHING AGAINST HER
HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HIS DAY HAD ALSO COME NOW THAT HIS HOUR HAD
STRUCK THAT FOLLOWING HIS FATHER HE TOO WAS ABOUT TO SHOW HIMSELF
BRAVE INTREPID BOLD TO RUN TO MEET THE BULLETS TO OFFER HIS BREAST
TO BAYONETS TO SHED HIS BLOOD TO SEEK THE ENEMY TO SEEK DEATH THAT
HE WAS ABOUT TO WAGE WAR IN HIS TURN AND DESCEND TO THE FIELD OF BATTLE
AND THAT THE FIELD OF BATTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS TO DESCEND WAS THE
STREET AND THAT THE WAR IN WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO ENGAGE WAS CIVIL WAR
HE BEHELD CIVIL WAR LAID OPEN LIKE A GULF BEFORE HIM AND INTO THIS HE
WAS ABOUT TO FALL
THEN HE SHUDDERED
HE THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER'S SWORD WHICH HIS GRANDFATHER HAD SOLD TO A
SECOND HAND DEALER AND WHICH HE HAD SO MOURNFULLY REGRETTED
HE SAID TO
HIMSELF THAT THAT CHASTE AND VALIANT SWORD HAD DONE WELL TO ESCAPE FROM
HIM AND TO DEPART IN WRATH INTO THE GLOOM THAT IF IT HAD THUS FLED IT
WAS BECAUSE IT WAS INTELLIGENT AND BECAUSE IT HAD FORESEEN THE FUTURE
THAT IT HAD HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF THIS REBELLION THE WAR OF THE
GUTTERS THE WAR OF THE PAVEMENTS FUSILLADES THROUGH CELLAR WINDOWS
BLOWS GIVEN AND RECEIVED IN THE REAR IT WAS BECAUSE COMING FROM
MARENGO AND FRIEDLAND IT DID NOT WISH TO GO TO THE RUE DE LA
CHANVRERIE IT WAS BECAUSE AFTER WHAT IT HAD DONE WITH THE FATHER IT
DID NOT WISH TO DO THIS FOR THE SON HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IF THAT SWORD
WERE THERE IF AFTER TAKING POSSESSION OF IT AT HIS FATHER'S PILLOW
HE HAD DARED TO TAKE IT AND CARRY IT OFF FOR THIS COMBAT OF DARKNESS
BETWEEN FRENCHMEN IN THE STREETS IT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE SCORCHED HIS
HANDS AND BURST OUT AFLAME BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE THE SWORD OF THE ANGEL
HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT IT WAS NOT THERE AND THAT
IT HAD DISAPPEARED THAT THAT WAS WELL THAT THAT WAS JUST THAT HIS
GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN THE TRUE GUARDIAN OF HIS FATHER'S GLORY AND THAT
IT WAS FAR BETTER THAT THE COLONEL'S SWORD SHOULD BE SOLD AT AUCTION
SOLD TO THE OLD CLOTHES MAN THROWN AMONG THE OLD JUNK THAN THAT IT
SHOULD TO DAY WOUND THE SIDE OF HIS COUNTRY
AND THEN HE FELL TO WEEPING BITTERLY
THIS WAS HORRIBLE
BUT WHAT WAS HE TO DO LIVE WITHOUT COSETTE HE COULD
NOT
SINCE SHE WAS GONE HE MUST NEEDS DIE
HAD HE NOT GIVEN HER HIS
WORD OF HONOR THAT HE WOULD DIE SHE HAD GONE KNOWING THAT THIS MEANT
THAT IT PLEASED HER THAT MARIUS SHOULD DIE
AND THEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT
SHE NO LONGER LOVED HIM SINCE SHE HAD DEPARTED THUS WITHOUT WARNING
WITHOUT A WORD WITHOUT A LETTER ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW HIS ADDRESS WHAT
WAS THE GOOD OF LIVING AND WHY SHOULD HE LIVE NOW AND THEN WHAT
SHOULD HE RETREAT AFTER GOING SO FAR SHOULD HE FLEE FROM DANGER AFTER
HAVING APPROACHED IT SHOULD HE SLIP AWAY AFTER HAVING COME AND PEEPED
INTO THE BARRICADE SLIP AWAY ALL IN A TREMBLE SAYING AFTER ALL I
HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AS IT IS
I HAVE SEEN IT THAT SUFFICES THIS IS
CIVIL WAR AND I SHALL TAKE MY LEAVE SHOULD HE ABANDON HIS FRIENDS WHO
WERE EXPECTING HIM WHO WERE IN NEED OF HIM POSSIBLY WHO WERE A MERE
HANDFUL AGAINST AN ARMY SHOULD HE BE UNTRUE AT ONCE TO HIS LOVE TO
COUNTRY TO HIS WORD SHOULD HE GIVE TO HIS COWARDICE THE PRETEXT OF
PATRIOTISM BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND IF THE PHANTOM OF HIS FATHER
WAS THERE IN THE GLOOM AND BEHELD HIM RETREATING HE WOULD BEAT HIM ON
THE LOINS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS SWORD AND SHOUT TO HIM MARCH ON YOU
POLTROON
THUS A PREY TO THE CONFLICTING MOVEMENTS OF HIS THOUGHTS HE DROPPED HIS
HEAD
ALL AT ONCE HE RAISED IT
A SORT OF SPLENDID RECTIFICATION HAD JUST BEEN
EFFECTED IN HIS MIND
THERE IS A WIDENING OF THE SPHERE OF THOUGHT WHICH
IS PECULIAR TO THE VICINITY OF THE GRAVE IT MAKES ONE SEE CLEARLY TO
BE NEAR DEATH
THE VISION OF THE ACTION INTO WHICH HE FELT THAT HE
WAS PERHAPS ON THE POINT OF ENTERING APPEARED TO HIM NO MORE
AS LAMENTABLE BUT AS SUPERB
THE WAR OF THE STREET WAS SUDDENLY
TRANSFIGURED BY SOME UNFATHOMABLE INWARD WORKING OF HIS SOUL BEFORE THE
EYE OF HIS THOUGHT
ALL THE TUMULTUOUS INTERROGATION POINTS OF REVERY
RECURRED TO HIM IN THRONGS BUT WITHOUT TROUBLING HIM
HE LEFT NONE OF
THEM UNANSWERED
LET US SEE WHY SHOULD HIS FATHER BE INDIGNANT ARE THERE NOT CASES
WHERE INSURRECTION RISES TO THE DIGNITY OF DUTY WHAT WAS THERE THAT WAS
DEGRADING FOR THE SON OF COLONEL PONTMERCY IN THE COMBAT WHICH WAS ABOUT
TO BEGIN IT IS NO LONGER MONTMIRAIL NOR CHAMPAUBERT IT IS SOMETHING
QUITE DIFFERENT
THE QUESTION IS NO LONGER ONE OF SACRED TERRITORY BUT
OF A HOLY IDEA
THE COUNTRY WAILS THAT MAY BE BUT HUMANITY APPLAUDS
BUT IS IT TRUE THAT THE COUNTRY DOES WAIL FRANCE BLEEDS BUT LIBERTY
SMILES AND IN THE PRESENCE OF LIBERTY'S SMILE FRANCE FORGETS HER
WOUND
AND THEN IF WE LOOK AT THINGS FROM A STILL MORE LOFTY POINT OF
VIEW WHY DO WE SPEAK OF CIVIL WAR
CIVIL WAR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THERE A FOREIGN WAR IS NOT ALL WAR
BETWEEN MEN WAR BETWEEN BROTHERS WAR IS QUALIFIED ONLY BY ITS OBJECT
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FOREIGN OR CIVIL WAR THERE IS ONLY JUST AND
UNJUST WAR
UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN THE GRAND HUMAN AGREEMENT IS CONCLUDED
WAR THAT AT LEAST WHICH IS THE EFFORT OF THE FUTURE WHICH IS HASTENING
ON AGAINST THE PAST WHICH IS LAGGING IN THE REAR MAY BE NECESSARY
WHAT HAVE WE TO REPROACH THAT WAR WITH WAR DOES NOT BECOME A DISGRACE
THE SWORD DOES NOT BECOME A DISGRACE EXCEPT WHEN IT IS USED FOR
ASSASSINATING THE RIGHT PROGRESS REASON CIVILIZATION TRUTH
THEN
WAR WHETHER FOREIGN OR CIVIL IS INIQUITOUS IT IS CALLED CRIME
OUTSIDE THE PALE OF THAT HOLY THING JUSTICE BY WHAT RIGHT DOES
ONE FORM OF MAN DESPISE ANOTHER BY WHAT RIGHT SHOULD THE SWORD OF
WASHINGTON DISOWN THE PIKE OF CAMILLE DESMOULINS LEONIDAS AGAINST THE
STRANGER TIMOLEON AGAINST THE TYRANT WHICH IS THE GREATER THE ONE IS
THE DEFENDER THE OTHER THE LIBERATOR
SHALL WE BRAND EVERY APPEAL
TO ARMS WITHIN A CITY'S LIMITS WITHOUT TAKING THE OBJECT INTO A
CONSIDERATION THEN NOTE THE INFAMY OF BRUTUS MARCEL ARNOULD VON
BLANKENHEIM COLIGNY HEDGEROW WAR WAR OF THE STREETS WHY NOT THAT
WAS THE WAR OF AMBIORIX OF ARTEVELDE OF MARNIX OF PELAGIUS
BUT
AMBIORIX FOUGHT AGAINST ROME ARTEVELDE AGAINST FRANCE MARNIX AGAINST
SPAIN PELAGIUS AGAINST THE MOORS ALL AGAINST THE FOREIGNER
WELL THE
MONARCHY IS A FOREIGNER OPPRESSION IS A STRANGER THE RIGHT DIVINE IS
A STRANGER
DESPOTISM VIOLATES THE MORAL FRONTIER AN INVASION VIOLATES
THE GEOGRAPHICAL FRONTIER
DRIVING OUT THE TYRANT OR DRIVING OUT THE
ENGLISH IN BOTH CASES REGAINING POSSESSION OF ONE'S OWN TERRITORY
THERE COMES AN HOUR WHEN PROTESTATION NO LONGER SUFFICES AFTER

DESPAIR IN THE VERY AGONY OF THEIR BLACKEST MONOLOGUES TREAT SUBJECTS
AND DISCUSS THESES
LOGIC IS MINGLED WITH CONVULSION AND THE THREAD
OF THE SYLLOGISM FLOATS WITHOUT BREAKING IN THE MOURNFUL STORM OF
THOUGHT
THIS WAS THE SITUATION OF MARIUS' MIND
AS HE MEDITATED THUS DEJECTED BUT RESOLUTE HESITATING IN EVERY
DIRECTION AND IN SHORT SHUDDERING AT WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO DO HIS
GLANCE STRAYED TO THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE
THE INSURGENTS
WERE HERE CONVERSING IN A LOW VOICE WITHOUT MOVING AND THERE
WAS PERCEPTIBLE THAT QUASI SILENCE WHICH MARKS THE LAST STAGE OF
EXPECTATION
OVERHEAD AT THE SMALL WINDOW IN THE THIRD STORY MARIUS
DESCRIED A SORT OF SPECTATOR WHO APPEARED TO HIM TO BE SINGULARLY
ATTENTIVE
THIS WAS THE PORTER WHO HAD BEEN KILLED BY LE CABUC
BELOW
BY THE LIGHTS OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS THRUST BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES
THIS HEAD COULD BE VAGUELY DISTINGUISHED
NOTHING COULD BE STRANGER IN
THAT SOMBRE AND UNCERTAIN GLEAM THAN THAT LIVID MOTIONLESS ASTONISHED
FACE WITH ITS BRISTLING HAIR ITS EYES FIXED AND STARING AND ITS
YAWNING MOUTH BENT OVER THE STREET IN AN ATTITUDE OF CURIOSITY
ONE
WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE MAN WHO WAS DEAD WAS SURVEYING THOSE WHO WERE
ABOUT TO DIE
A LONG TRAIL OF BLOOD WHICH HAD FLOWED FROM THAT HEAD
DESCENDED IN REDDISH THREADS FROM THE WINDOW TO THE HEIGHT OF THE FIRST
FLOOR WHERE IT STOPPED
BOOK FOURTEENTH THE GRANDEURS OF DESPAIR
ILLUSTRATION THE GRANDEURS OF DESPAIR 4B 14 1 DESPAIR
CHAPTER I THE FLAG ACT FIRST
AS YET NOTHING HAD COME
TEN O'CLOCK HAD SOUNDED FROM SAINT MERRY
ENJOLRAS AND COMBEFERRE HAD GONE AND SEATED THEMSELVES CARBINES IN
HAND NEAR THE OUTLET OF THE GRAND BARRICADE
THEY NO LONGER ADDRESSED
EACH OTHER THEY LISTENED SEEKING TO CATCH EVEN THE FAINTEST AND MOST
DISTANT SOUND OF MARCHING
SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF THE DISMAL CALM A CLEAR GAY YOUNG VOICE
WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE RUE SAINT DENIS ROSE AND BEGAN TO SING
DISTINCTLY TO THE OLD POPULAR AIR OF BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON THIS
BIT OF POETRY TERMINATED BY A CRY LIKE THE CROW OF A COCK
MON NEZ EST EN LARMES
MON AMI BUGEAUD
PRETE MOI TES GENDARMES
POUR LEUR DIRE UN MOT
EN CAPOTE BLEUE
LA POULE AU SHAKO
VOICI LA BANLIEUE
CO COCORICO 54
THEY PRESSED EACH OTHER'S HANDS
THAT IS GAVROCHE SAID ENJOLRAS
HE IS WARNING US SAID COMBEFERRE
A HASTY RUSH TROUBLED THE DESERTED STREET THEY BEHELD A BEING MORE
AGILE THAN A CLOWN CLIMB OVER THE OMNIBUS AND GAVROCHE BOUNDED INTO THE
BARRICADE ALL BREATHLESS SAYING
MY GUN HERE THEY ARE
AN ELECTRIC QUIVER SHOT THROUGH THE WHOLE BARRICADE AND THE SOUND OF
HANDS SEEKING THEIR GUNS BECAME AUDIBLE
WOULD YOU LIKE MY CARBINE SAID ENJOLRAS TO THE LAD
I WANT A BIG GUN REPLIED GAVROCHE
AND HE SEIZED JAVERT'S GUN
TWO SENTINELS HAD FALLEN BACK AND HAD COME IN ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT
AS GAVROCHE
THEY WERE THE SENTINELS FROM THE END OF THE STREET AND THE
VIDETTE OF THE RUE DE LA PETITE TRUANDERIE
THE VIDETTE OF THE LANE DES
PRECHEURS HAD REMAINED AT HIS POST WHICH INDICATED THAT NOTHING WAS
APPROACHING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE BRIDGES AND HALLES
THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE OF WHICH A FEW PAVING STONES ALONE WERE DIMLY
VISIBLE IN THE REFLECTION OF THE LIGHT PROJECTED ON THE FLAG OFFERED
TO THE INSURGENTS THE ASPECT OF A VAST BLACK DOOR VAGUELY OPENED INTO A
SMOKE
EACH MAN HAD TAKEN UP HIS POSITION FOR THE CONFLICT
FORTY THREE INSURGENTS AMONG WHOM WERE ENJOLRAS COMBEFERRE
COURFEYRAC BOSSUET JOLY BAHOREL AND GAVROCHE WERE KNEELING INSIDE
THE LARGE BARRICADE WITH THEIR HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THE CREST OF THE
BARRIER THE BARRELS OF THEIR GUNS AND CARBINES AIMED ON THE STONES AS
THOUGH AT LOOP HOLES ATTENTIVE MUTE READY TO FIRE
SIX COMMANDED
BY FEUILLY HAD INSTALLED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR GUNS LEVELLED AT THEIR
SHOULDERS AT THE WINDOWS OF THE TWO STORIES OF CORINTHE
SEVERAL MINUTES PASSED THUS THEN A SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS MEASURED HEAVY
AND NUMEROUS BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE DIRECTION OF SAINT LEU
THIS SOUND FAINT AT FIRST THEN PRECISE THEN HEAVY AND SONOROUS
APPROACHED SLOWLY WITHOUT HALT WITHOUT INTERMISSION WITH A TRANQUIL
AND TERRIBLE CONTINUITY
NOTHING WAS TO BE HEARD BUT THIS
IT WAS THAT
COMBINED SILENCE AND SOUND OF THE STATUE OF THE COMMANDER BUT THIS
STONY STEP HAD SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY ENORMOUS AND MULTIPLE ABOUT IT
WHICH AWAKENED THE IDEA OF A THRONG AND AT THE SAME TIME THE IDEA
OF A SPECTRE
ONE THOUGHT ONE HEARD THE TERRIBLE STATUE LEGION MARCHING
ONWARD
THIS TREAD DREW NEAR IT DREW STILL NEARER AND STOPPED
IT
SEEMED AS THOUGH THE BREATHING OF MANY MEN COULD BE HEARD AT THE END OF
THE STREET
NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN HOWEVER BUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT
DENSE OBSCURITY THERE COULD BE DISTINGUISHED A MULTITUDE OF METALLIC
THREADS AS FINE AS NEEDLES AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE WHICH MOVED ABOUT
LIKE THOSE INDESCRIBABLE PHOSPHORIC NETWORKS WHICH ONE SEES BENEATH
ONE'S CLOSED EYELIDS IN THE FIRST MISTS OF SLUMBER AT THE MOMENT
WHEN ONE IS DROPPING OFF TO SLEEP
THESE WERE BAYONETS AND GUN BARRELS
CONFUSEDLY ILLUMINATED BY THE DISTANT REFLECTION OF THE TORCH
A PAUSE ENSUED AS THOUGH BOTH SIDES WERE WAITING
ALL AT ONCE FROM THE
DEPTHS OF THIS DARKNESS A VOICE WHICH WAS ALL THE MORE SINISTER SINCE
NO ONE WAS VISIBLE AND WHICH APPEARED TO BE THE GLOOM ITSELF SPEAKING
SHOUTED
WHO GOES THERE
AT THE SAME TIME THE CLICK OF GUNS AS THEY WERE LOWERED INTO POSITION
WAS HEARD
ENJOLRAS REPLIED IN A HAUGHTY AND VIBRATING TONE
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
FIRE SHOUTED THE VOICE
A FLASH EMPURPLED ALL THE FACADES IN THE STREET AS THOUGH THE DOOR OF A
FURNACE HAD BEEN FLUNG OPEN AND HASTILY CLOSED AGAIN
A FEARFUL DETONATION BURST FORTH ON THE BARRICADE
THE RED FLAG FELL
THE DISCHARGE HAD BEEN SO VIOLENT AND SO DENSE THAT IT HAD CUT THE
STAFF THAT IS TO SAY THE VERY TIP OF THE OMNIBUS POLE
BULLETS WHICH HAD REBOUNDED FROM THE CORNICES OF THE HOUSES PENETRATED
THE BARRICADE AND WOUNDED SEVERAL MEN
THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY THIS FIRST DISCHARGE WAS FREEZING
THE ATTACK
HAD BEEN ROUGH AND OF A NATURE TO INSPIRE REFLECTION IN THE BOLDEST
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH AN ENTIRE REGIMENT AT THE VERY
LEAST
COMRADES SHOUTED COURFEYRAC LET US NOT WASTE OUR POWDER
LET US
WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE IN THE STREET BEFORE REPLYING
AND ABOVE ALL SAID ENJOLRAS LET US RAISE THE FLAG AGAIN
HE PICKED UP THE FLAG WHICH HAD FALLEN PRECISELY AT HIS FEET
OUTSIDE THE CLATTER OF THE RAMRODS IN THE GUNS COULD BE HEARD THE
TROOPS WERE RE LOADING THEIR ARMS
ENJOLRAS WENT ON
WHO IS THERE HERE WITH A BOLD HEART WHO WILL PLANT THE FLAG ON THE
BARRICADE AGAIN
NOT A MAN RESPONDED
TO MOUNT ON THE BARRICADE AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN
WITHOUT ANY DOUBT IT WAS AGAIN THE OBJECT OF THEIR AIM WAS SIMPLY
DEATH
THE BRAVEST HESITATED TO PRONOUNCE HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
ENJOLRAS
HIMSELF FELT A THRILL
HE REPEATED
DOES NO ONE VOLUNTEER
CHAPTER II THE FLAG ACT SECOND
SINCE THEY HAD ARRIVED AT CORINTHE AND HAD BEGUN THE CONSTRUCTION OF
THE BARRICADE NO ATTENTION HAD BEEN PAID TO FATHER MABEUF
M
MABEUF
HAD NOT QUITTED THE MOB HOWEVER HE HAD ENTERED THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE
WINE SHOP AND HAD SEATED HIMSELF BEHIND THE COUNTER
THERE HE HAD SO TO
SPEAK RETREATED INTO HIMSELF
HE NO LONGER SEEMED TO LOOK OR TO THINK
COURFEYRAC AND OTHERS HAD ACCOSTED HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES WARNING HIM
OF HIS PERIL BESEECHING HIM TO WITHDRAW BUT HE DID NOT HEAR THEM
WHEN THEY WERE NOT SPEAKING TO HIM HIS MOUTH MOVED AS THOUGH HE WERE
REPLYING TO SOME ONE AND AS SOON AS HE WAS ADDRESSED HIS LIPS BECAME
MOTIONLESS AND HIS EYES NO LONGER HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING ALIVE
SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE THE BARRICADE WAS ATTACKED HE HAD ASSUMED AN
ATTITUDE WHICH HE DID NOT AFTERWARDS ABANDON WITH BOTH FISTS PLANTED
ON HIS KNEES AND HIS HEAD THRUST FORWARD AS THOUGH HE WERE GAZING OVER A
PRECIPICE
NOTHING HAD BEEN ABLE TO MOVE HIM FROM THIS ATTITUDE IT DID
NOT SEEM AS THOUGH HIS MIND WERE IN THE BARRICADE
WHEN EACH HAD GONE
TO TAKE UP HIS POSITION FOR THE COMBAT THERE REMAINED IN THE TAP ROOM
WHERE JAVERT WAS BOUND TO THE POST ONLY A SINGLE INSURGENT WITH A NAKED
SWORD WATCHING OVER JAVERT AND HIMSELF MABEUF
AT THE MOMENT OF THE
ATTACK AT THE DETONATION THE PHYSICAL SHOCK HAD REACHED HIM AND HAD
AS IT WERE AWAKENED HIM HE STARTED UP ABRUPTLY CROSSED THE ROOM
AND AT THE INSTANT WHEN ENJOLRAS REPEATED HIS APPEAL DOES NO ONE
VOLUNTEER THE OLD MAN WAS SEEN TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE ON THE THRESHOLD
OF THE WINE SHOP
HIS PRESENCE PRODUCED A SORT OF COMMOTION IN THE
DIFFERENT GROUPS
A SHOUT WENT UP
IT IS THE VOTER IT IS THE MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION IT IS THE
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE DID NOT HEAR THEM
HE STRODE STRAIGHT UP TO ENJOLRAS THE INSURGENTS WITHDRAWING BEFORE HIM
WITH A RELIGIOUS FEAR HE TORE THE FLAG FROM ENJOLRAS WHO RECOILED IN
AMAZEMENT AND THEN SINCE NO ONE DARED TO STOP OR TO ASSIST HIM THIS
OLD MAN OF EIGHTY WITH SHAKING HEAD BUT FIRM FOOT BEGAN SLOWLY TO
ASCEND THE STAIRCASE OF PAVING STONES ARRANGED IN THE BARRICADE
THIS
WAS SO MELANCHOLY AND SO GRAND THAT ALL AROUND HIM CRIED OFF WITH YOUR
HATS AT EVERY STEP THAT HE MOUNTED IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL SPECTACLE HIS
WHITE LOCKS HIS DECREPIT FACE HIS LOFTY BALD AND WRINKLED BROW
HIS AMAZED AND OPEN MOUTH HIS AGED ARM UPHOLDING THE RED BANNER ROSE
THROUGH THE GLOOM AND WERE ENLARGED IN THE BLOODY LIGHT OF THE TORCH
AND THE BYSTANDERS THOUGHT THAT THEY BEHELD THE SPECTRE OF '93 EMERGING
FROM THE EARTH WITH THE FLAG OF TERROR IN HIS HAND
WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE LAST STEP WHEN THIS TREMBLING AND TERRIBLE
PHANTOM ERECT ON THAT PILE OF RUBBISH IN THE PRESENCE OF TWELVE HUNDRED
INVISIBLE GUNS DREW HIMSELF UP IN THE FACE OF DEATH AND AS THOUGH
HE WERE MORE POWERFUL THAN IT THE WHOLE BARRICADE ASSUMED AMID THE
DARKNESS A SUPERNATURAL AND COLOSSAL FORM
THERE ENSUED ONE OF THOSE SILENCES WHICH OCCUR ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF
PRODIGIES
IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE OLD MAN WAVED THE RED FLAG
AND SHOUTED
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC FRATERNITY EQUALITY
AND DEATH
THOSE IN THE BARRICADE HEARD A LOW AND RAPID WHISPER LIKE THE MURMUR
OF A PRIEST WHO IS DESPATCHING A PRAYER IN HASTE
IT WAS PROBABLY THE
COMMISSARY OF POLICE WHO WAS MAKING THE LEGAL SUMMONS AT THE OTHER END
OF THE STREET
THEN THE SAME PIERCING VOICE WHICH HAD SHOUTED WHO GOES THERE
SHOUTED
RETIRE
M
MABEUF PALE HAGGARD HIS EYES LIGHTED UP WITH THE MOURNFUL FLAME OF
ABERRATION RAISED THE FLAG ABOVE HIS HEAD AND REPEATED
LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC
FIRE SAID THE VOICE
A SECOND DISCHARGE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST RAINED DOWN UPON THE
BARRICADE
THE OLD MAN FELL ON HIS KNEES THEN ROSE AGAIN DROPPED THE FLAG
AND FELL BACKWARDS ON THE PAVEMENT LIKE A LOG AT FULL LENGTH WITH
OUTSTRETCHED ARMS
RIVULETS OF BLOOD FLOWED BENEATH HIM
HIS AGED HEAD PALE AND SAD
SEEMED TO BE GAZING AT THE SKY
ONE OF THOSE EMOTIONS WHICH ARE SUPERIOR TO MAN WHICH MAKE HIM FORGET
EVEN TO DEFEND HIMSELF SEIZED UPON THE INSURGENTS AND THEY APPROACHED
THE BODY WITH RESPECTFUL AWE
WHAT MEN THESE REGICIDES WERE SAID ENJOLRAS
COURFEYRAC BENT DOWN TO ENJOLRAS' EAR
THIS IS FOR YOURSELF ALONE I DO NOT WISH TO DAMPEN THE ENTHUSIASM
BUT
THIS MAN WAS ANYTHING RATHER THAN A REGICIDE
I KNEW HIM
HIS NAME WAS
FATHER MABEUF
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM TO DAY
BUT HE
WAS A BRAVE BLOCKHEAD
JUST LOOK AT HIS HEAD
THE HEAD OF A BLOCKHEAD AND THE HEART OF A BRUTUS REPLIED ENJOLRAS
THEN HE RAISED HIS VOICE
CITIZENS THIS IS THE EXAMPLE WHICH THE OLD GIVE TO THE YOUNG
WE
HESITATED HE CAME WE WERE DRAWING BACK HE ADVANCED THIS IS WHAT
THOSE WHO ARE TREMBLING WITH AGE TEACH TO THOSE WHO TREMBLE WITH FEAR
THIS AGED MAN IS AUGUST IN THE EYES OF HIS COUNTRY
HE HAS HAD A LONG
LIFE AND A MAGNIFICENT DEATH NOW LET US PLACE THE BODY UNDER COVER
THAT EACH ONE OF US MAY DEFEND THIS OLD MAN DEAD AS HE WOULD HIS
FATHER LIVING AND MAY HIS PRESENCE IN OUR MIDST RENDER THE BARRICADE
IMPREGNABLE
A MURMUR OF GLOOMY AND ENERGETIC ASSENT FOLLOWED THESE WORDS
ENJOLRAS BENT DOWN RAISED THE OLD MAN'S HEAD AND FIERCE AS HE WAS HE
KISSED HIM ON THE BROW THEN THROWING WIDE HIS ARMS AND HANDLING THIS
DEAD MAN WITH TENDER PRECAUTION AS THOUGH HE FEARED TO HURT IT HE
REMOVED HIS COAT SHOWED THE BLOODY HOLES IN IT TO ALL AND SAID
THIS IS OUR FLAG NOW
CHAPTER III GAVROCHE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO ACCEPT ENJOLRAS' CARBINE
THEY THREW A LONG BLACK SHAWL OF WIDOW HUCHELOUP'S OVER FATHER MABEUF
SIX MEN MADE A LITTER OF THEIR GUNS ON THIS THEY LAID THE BODY AND
BORE IT WITH BARED HEADS WITH SOLEMN SLOWNESS TO THE LARGE TABLE IN
THE TAP ROOM
THESE MEN WHOLLY ABSORBED IN THE GRAVE AND SACRED TASK IN WHICH THEY
WERE ENGAGED THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE PERILOUS SITUATION IN WHICH THEY
STOOD
WHEN THE CORPSE PASSED NEAR JAVERT WHO WAS STILL IMPASSIVE ENJOLRAS
SAID TO THE SPY
IT WILL BE YOUR TURN PRESENTLY
DURING ALL THIS TIME LITTLE GAVROCHE WHO ALONE HAD NOT QUITTED HIS
POST BUT HAD REMAINED ON GUARD THOUGHT HE ESPIED SOME MEN STEALTHILY
APPROACHING THE BARRICADE
ALL AT ONCE HE SHOUTED
LOOK OUT
COURFEYRAC ENJOLRAS JEAN PROUVAIRE COMBEFERRE JOLY BAHOREL
BOSSUET AND ALL THE REST RAN TUMULTUOUSLY FROM THE WINE SHOP
IT WAS
ALMOST TOO LATE
THEY SAW A GLISTENING DENSITY OF BAYONETS UNDULATING
ABOVE THE BARRICADE
MUNICIPAL GUARDS OF LOFTY STATURE WERE MAKING
THEIR WAY IN SOME STRIDING OVER THE OMNIBUS OTHERS THROUGH THE CUT
THRUSTING BEFORE THEM THE URCHIN WHO RETREATED BUT DID NOT FLEE
THE MOMENT WAS CRITICAL
IT WAS THAT FIRST REDOUBTABLE MOMENT OF
INUNDATION WHEN THE STREAM RISES TO THE LEVEL OF THE LEVEE AND WHEN THE
WATER BEGINS TO FILTER THROUGH THE FISSURES OF DIKE
A SECOND MORE AND
THE BARRICADE WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
BAHOREL DASHED UPON THE FIRST MUNICIPAL GUARD WHO WAS ENTERING AND
KILLED HIM ON THE SPOT WITH A BLOW FROM HIS GUN THE SECOND KILLED
BAHOREL WITH A BLOW FROM HIS BAYONET
ANOTHER HAD ALREADY OVERTHROWN
COURFEYRAC WHO WAS SHOUTING FOLLOW ME THE LARGEST OF ALL A SORT OF
COLOSSUS MARCHED ON GAVROCHE WITH HIS BAYONET FIXED
THE URCHIN TOOK IN
HIS ARMS JAVERT'S IMMENSE GUN LEVELLED IT RESOLUTELY AT THE GIANT AND
FIRED
NO DISCHARGE FOLLOWED
JAVERT'S GUN WAS NOT LOADED
THE MUNICIPAL
GUARD BURST INTO A LAUGH AND RAISED HIS BAYONET AT THE CHILD
BEFORE THE BAYONET HAD TOUCHED GAVROCHE THE GUN SLIPPED FROM THE
SOLDIER'S GRASP A BULLET HAD STRUCK THE MUNICIPAL GUARDSMAN IN THE
CENTRE OF THE FOREHEAD AND HE FELL OVER ON HIS BACK
A SECOND BULLET
STRUCK THE OTHER GUARD WHO HAD ASSAULTED COURFEYRAC IN THE BREAST AND
LAID HIM LOW ON THE PAVEMENT
THIS WAS THE WORK OF MARIUS WHO HAD JUST ENTERED THE BARRICADE
CHAPTER IV THE BARREL OF POWDER
MARIUS STILL CONCEALED IN THE TURN OF THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD WITNESSED
SHUDDERING AND IRRESOLUTE THE FIRST PHASE OF THE COMBAT
BUT HE HAD NOT
LONG BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THAT MYSTERIOUS AND SOVEREIGN VERTIGO WHICH MAY
BE DESIGNATED AS THE CALL OF THE ABYSS
IN THE PRESENCE OF THE IMMINENCE
OF THE PERIL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DEATH OF M
MABEUF THAT MELANCHOLY
ENIGMA IN THE PRESENCE OF BAHOREL KILLED AND COURFEYRAC SHOUTING
FOLLOW ME OF THAT CHILD THREATENED OF HIS FRIENDS TO SUCCOR OR TO
AVENGE ALL HESITATION HAD VANISHED AND HE HAD FLUNG HIMSELF INTO THE
CONFLICT HIS TWO PISTOLS IN HAND
WITH HIS FIRST SHOT HE HAD SAVED
GAVROCHE AND WITH THE SECOND DELIVERED COURFEYRAC
AMID THE SOUND OF THE SHOTS AMID THE CRIES OF THE ASSAULTED GUARDS
THE ASSAILANTS HAD CLIMBED THE ENTRENCHMENT ON WHOSE SUMMIT MUNICIPAL
GUARDS SOLDIERS OF THE LINE AND NATIONAL GUARDS FROM THE SUBURBS COULD
NOW BE SEEN GUN IN HAND REARING THEMSELVES TO MORE THAN HALF THE
HEIGHT OF THEIR BODIES
THEY ALREADY COVERED MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE BARRIER BUT THEY DID
NOT LEAP INTO THE ENCLOSURE AS THOUGH WAVERING IN THE FEAR OF SOME
TRAP
THEY GAZED INTO THE DARK BARRICADE AS ONE WOULD GAZE INTO A LION'S
DEN
THE LIGHT OF THE TORCH ILLUMINATED ONLY THEIR BAYONETS THEIR
BEAR SKIN CAPS AND THE UPPER PART OF THEIR UNEASY AND ANGRY FACES
MARIUS HAD NO LONGER ANY WEAPONS HE HAD FLUNG AWAY HIS DISCHARGED
PISTOLS AFTER FIRING THEM BUT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BARREL OF
POWDER IN THE TAP ROOM NEAR THE DOOR
AS HE TURNED HALF ROUND GAZING IN THAT DIRECTION A SOLDIER TOOK AIM AT
HIM
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE SOLDIER WAS SIGHTING MARIUS A HAND WAS LAID
ON THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN AND OBSTRUCTED IT
THIS WAS DONE BY SOME ONE
WHO HAD DARTED FORWARD THE YOUNG WORKMAN IN VELVET TROUSERS
THE SHOT
SPED TRAVERSED THE HAND AND POSSIBLY ALSO THE WORKMAN SINCE HE FELL
BUT THE BALL DID NOT STRIKE MARIUS
ALL THIS WHICH WAS RATHER TO BE
APPREHENDED THAN SEEN THROUGH THE SMOKE MARIUS WHO WAS ENTERING THE
TAP ROOM HARDLY NOTICED
STILL HE HAD IN A CONFUSED WAY PERCEIVED
THAT GUN BARREL AIMED AT HIM AND THE HAND WHICH HAD BLOCKED IT AND HE
HAD HEARD THE DISCHARGE
BUT IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS THE THINGS WHICH ONE
SEES VACILLATE AND ARE PRECIPITATED AND ONE PAUSES FOR NOTHING
ONE
FEELS OBSCURELY IMPELLED TOWARDS MORE DARKNESS STILL AND ALL IS CLOUD
THE INSURGENTS SURPRISED BUT NOT TERRIFIED HAD RALLIED
ENJOLRAS HAD
SHOUTED WAIT DON'T FIRE AT RANDOM IN THE FIRST CONFUSION THEY
MIGHT IN FACT WOUND EACH OTHER
THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAD ASCENDED
TO THE WINDOW ON THE FIRST STORY AND TO THE ATTIC WINDOWS WHENCE THEY
COMMANDED THE ASSAILANTS
THE MOST DETERMINED WITH ENJOLRAS COURFEYRAC JEAN PROUVAIRE AND
COMBEFERRE HAD PROUDLY PLACED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR BACKS AGAINST THE
HOUSES AT THE REAR UNSHELTERED AND FACING THE RANKS OF SOLDIERS AND
GUARDS WHO CROWNED THE BARRICADE
ALL THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT HASTE WITH THAT STRANGE AND
THREATENING GRAVITY WHICH PRECEDES ENGAGEMENTS
THEY TOOK AIM POINT
BLANK ON BOTH SIDES THEY WERE SO CLOSE THAT THEY COULD TALK TOGETHER
WITHOUT RAISING THEIR VOICES
WHEN THEY HAD REACHED THIS POINT WHERE THE SPARK IS ON THE BRINK OF
DARTING FORTH AN OFFICER IN A GORGET EXTENDED HIS SWORD AND SAID
LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS
FIRE REPLIED ENJOLRAS
THE TWO DISCHARGES TOOK PLACE AT THE SAME MOMENT AND ALL DISAPPEARED IN
SMOKE
AN ACRID AND STIFLING SMOKE IN WHICH DYING AND WOUNDED LAY WITH WEAK
DULL GROANS
WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED AWAY THE COMBATANTS ON BOTH SIDES
COULD BE SEEN TO BE THINNED OUT BUT STILL IN THE SAME POSITIONS
RELOADING IN SILENCE
ALL AT ONCE A THUNDERING VOICE WAS HEARD
SHOUTING
BE OFF WITH YOU OR I'LL BLOW UP THE BARRICADE
ALL TURNED IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE THE VOICE PROCEEDED
MARIUS HAD ENTERED THE TAP ROOM AND HAD SEIZED THE BARREL OF POWDER
THEN HE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE SMOKE AND THE SORT OF OBSCURE MIST
WHICH FILLED THE ENTRENCHED ENCLOSURE TO GLIDE ALONG THE BARRICADE AS
FAR AS THAT CAGE OF PAVING STONES WHERE THE TORCH WAS FIXED
TO TEAR
IT FROM THE TORCH TO REPLACE IT BY THE BARREL OF POWDER TO THRUST THE
PILE OF STONES UNDER THE BARREL WHICH WAS INSTANTLY STAVED IN WITH
A SORT OF HORRIBLE OBEDIENCE ALL THIS HAD COST MARIUS BUT THE TIME
NECESSARY TO STOOP AND RISE AGAIN AND NOW ALL NATIONAL GUARDS
MUNICIPAL GUARDS OFFICERS SOLDIERS HUDDLED AT THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF
THE BARRICADE GAZED STUPIDLY AT HIM AS HE STOOD WITH HIS FOOT ON THE
STONES HIS TORCH IN HIS HAND HIS HAUGHTY FACE ILLUMINATED BY A FATAL
RESOLUTION DROOPING THE FLAME OF THE TORCH TOWARDS THAT REDOUBTABLE
PILE WHERE THEY COULD MAKE OUT THE BROKEN BARREL OF POWDER AND GIVING
VENT TO THAT STARTLING CRY
BE OFF WITH YOU OR I'LL BLOW UP THE BARRICADE
MARIUS ON THAT BARRICADE AFTER THE OCTOGENARIAN WAS THE VISION OF THE
YOUNG REVOLUTION AFTER THE APPARITION OF THE OLD
BLOW UP THE BARRICADE SAID A SERGEANT AND YOURSELF WITH IT
MARIUS RETORTED AND MYSELF ALSO
AND HE DROPPED THE TORCH TOWARDS THE BARREL OF POWDER
BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ONE ON THE BARRIER
THE ASSAILANTS
ABANDONING THEIR DEAD AND WOUNDED FLOWED BACK PELL MELL AND IN DISORDER
TOWARDS THE EXTREMITY OF THE STREET AND THERE WERE AGAIN LOST IN THE
NIGHT
IT WAS A HEADLONG FLIGHT
THE BARRICADE WAS FREE
CHAPTER V END OF THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIRE
ALL FLOCKED AROUND MARIUS
COURFEYRAC FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS NECK
HERE YOU ARE
WHAT LUCK SAID COMBEFERRE
YOU CAME IN OPPORTUNELY EJACULATED BOSSUET
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD BEGAN COURFEYRAC
AGAIN
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOBBLED UP ADDED
GAVROCHE
MARIUS ASKED
WHERE IS THE CHIEF
YOU ARE HE SAID ENJOLRAS
MARIUS HAD HAD A FURNACE IN HIS BRAIN ALL DAY LONG NOW IT WAS A
WHIRLWIND
THIS WHIRLWIND WHICH WAS WITHIN HIM PRODUCED ON HIM THE
EFFECT OF BEING OUTSIDE OF HIM AND OF BEARING HIM AWAY
IT SEEMED TO HIM
THAT HE WAS ALREADY AT AN IMMENSE DISTANCE FROM LIFE
HIS TWO LUMINOUS
MONTHS OF JOY AND LOVE ENDING ABRUPTLY AT THAT FRIGHTFUL PRECIPICE
COSETTE LOST TO HIM THAT BARRICADE M
MABEUF GETTING HIMSELF KILLED
FOR THE REPUBLIC HIMSELF THE LEADER OF THE INSURGENTS ALL THESE
THINGS APPEARED TO HIM LIKE A TREMENDOUS NIGHTMARE
HE WAS OBLIGED TO
MAKE A MENTAL EFFORT TO RECALL THE FACT THAT ALL THAT SURROUNDED HIM WAS
REAL
MARIUS HAD ALREADY SEEN TOO MUCH OF LIFE NOT TO KNOW THAT NOTHING
IS MORE IMMINENT THAN THE IMPOSSIBLE AND THAT WHAT IT IS ALWAYS
NECESSARY TO FORESEE IS THE UNFORESEEN
HE HAD LOOKED ON AT HIS OWN
DRAMA AS A PIECE WHICH ONE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
IN THE MISTS WHICH ENVELOPED HIS THOUGHTS HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE JAVERT
WHO BOUND TO HIS POST HAD NOT SO MUCH AS MOVED HIS HEAD DURING THE
WHOLE OF THE ATTACK ON THE BARRICADE AND WHO HAD GAZED ON THE REVOLT
SEETHING AROUND HIM WITH THE RESIGNATION OF A MARTYR AND THE MAJESTY OF
A JUDGE
MARIUS HAD NOT EVEN SEEN HIM
IN THE MEANWHILE THE ASSAILANTS DID NOT STIR THEY COULD BE HEARD
MARCHING AND SWARMING THROUGH AT THE END OF THE STREET BUT THEY DID NOT
VENTURE INTO IT EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE AWAITING ORDERS OR BECAUSE
THEY WERE AWAITING REINFORCEMENTS BEFORE HURLING THEMSELVES AFRESH ON
THIS IMPREGNABLE REDOUBT
THE INSURGENTS HAD POSTED SENTINELS AND SOME
OF THEM WHO WERE MEDICAL STUDENTS SET ABOUT CARING FOR THE WOUNDED
THEY HAD THROWN THE TABLES OUT OF THE WINE SHOP WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
THE TWO TABLES RESERVED FOR LINT AND CARTRIDGES AND OF THE ONE ON
WHICH LAY FATHER MABEUF THEY HAD ADDED THEM TO THE BARRICADE AND HAD
REPLACED THEM IN THE TAP ROOM WITH MATTRESSES FROM THE BED OF THE
WIDOW HUCHELOUP AND HER SERVANTS
ON THESE MATTRESSES THEY HAD LAID THE
WOUNDED
AS FOR THE THREE POOR CREATURES WHO INHABITED CORINTHE NO ONE
KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEM
THEY WERE FINALLY FOUND HOWEVER HIDDEN
IN THE CELLAR
A POIGNANT EMOTION CLOUDED THE JOY OF THE DISENCUMBERED BARRICADE
THE ROLL WAS CALLED
ONE OF THE INSURGENTS WAS MISSING
AND WHO WAS
IT ONE OF THE DEAREST
ONE OF THE MOST VALIANT
JEAN PROUVAIRE
HE
WAS SOUGHT AMONG THE WOUNDED HE WAS NOT THERE
HE WAS SOUGHT AMONG THE
DEAD HE WAS NOT THERE
HE WAS EVIDENTLY A PRISONER
COMBEFERRE SAID TO
ENJOLRAS
THEY HAVE OUR FRIEND WE HAVE THEIR AGENT
ARE YOU SET ON THE DEATH OF
THAT SPY
YES REPLIED ENJOLRAS BUT LESS SO THAN ON THE LIFE OF JEAN
PROUVAIRE
THIS TOOK PLACE IN THE TAP ROOM NEAR JAVERT'S POST
WELL RESUMED COMBEFERRE I AM GOING TO FASTEN MY HANDKERCHIEF TO
MY CANE AND GO AS A FLAG OF TRUCE TO OFFER TO EXCHANGE OUR MAN FOR
THEIRS
LISTEN SAID ENJOLRAS LAYING HIS HAND ON COMBEFERRE'S ARM
AT THE END OF THE STREET THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CLASH OF ARMS
THEY HEARD A MANLY VOICE SHOUT
VIVE LA FRANCE LONG LIVE FRANCE LONG LIVE THE FUTURE
THEY RECOGNIZED THE VOICE OF PROUVAIRE
A FLASH PASSED A REPORT RANG OUT
SILENCE FELL AGAIN
THEY HAVE KILLED HIM EXCLAIMED COMBEFERRE
ENJOLRAS GLANCED AT JAVERT AND SAID TO HIM
YOUR FRIENDS HAVE JUST SHOT YOU
CHAPTER VI THE AGONY OF DEATH AFTER THE AGONY OF LIFE
A PECULIARITY OF THIS SPECIES OF WAR IS THAT THE ATTACK OF THE
BARRICADES IS ALMOST ALWAYS MADE FROM THE FRONT AND THAT THE ASSAILANTS
GENERALLY ABSTAIN FROM TURNING THE POSITION EITHER BECAUSE THEY
FEAR AMBUSHES OR BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF GETTING ENTANGLED IN THE
TORTUOUS STREETS
THE INSURGENTS' WHOLE ATTENTION HAD BEEN DIRECTED
THEREFORE TO THE GRAND BARRICADE WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY THE SPOT ALWAYS
MENACED AND THERE THE STRUGGLE WOULD INFALLIBLY RECOMMENCE
BUT MARIUS
THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE BARRICADE AND WENT THITHER
IT WAS DESERTED AND
GUARDED ONLY BY THE FIRE POT WHICH TREMBLED BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES
MOREOVER THE MONDETOUR ALLEY AND THE BRANCHES OF THE RUE DE LA PETITE
TRUANDERIE AND THE RUE DU CYGNE WERE PROFOUNDLY CALM
AS MARIUS WAS WITHDRAWING AFTER CONCLUDING HIS INSPECTION HE HEARD HIS
NAME PRONOUNCED FEEBLY IN THE DARKNESS
MONSIEUR MARIUS
HE STARTED FOR HE RECOGNIZED THE VOICE WHICH HAD CALLED TO HIM TWO
HOURS BEFORE THROUGH THE GATE IN THE RUE PLUMET
ONLY THE VOICE NOW SEEMED TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A BREATH
HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM BUT SAW NO ONE
MARIUS THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN THAT IT WAS AN ILLUSION ADDED BY
HIS MIND TO THE EXTRAORDINARY REALITIES WHICH WERE CLASHING AROUND
HIM
HE ADVANCED A STEP IN ORDER TO QUIT THE DISTANT RECESS WHERE THE
BARRICADE LAY
MONSIEUR MARIUS REPEATED THE VOICE
THIS TIME HE COULD NOT DOUBT THAT HE HAD HEARD IT DISTINCTLY HE LOOKED
AND SAW NOTHING
AT YOUR FEET SAID THE VOICE
HE BENT DOWN AND SAW IN THE DARKNESS A FORM WHICH WAS DRAGGING ITSELF
TOWARDS HIM
IT WAS CRAWLING ALONG THE PAVEMENT
IT WAS THIS THAT HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
THE FIRE POT ALLOWED HIM TO DISTINGUISH A BLOUSE TORN TROUSERS OF
COARSE VELVET BARE FEET AND SOMETHING WHICH RESEMBLED A POOL OF BLOOD
MARIUS INDISTINCTLY MADE OUT A PALE HEAD WHICH WAS LIFTED TOWARDS HIM
AND WHICH WAS SAYING TO HIM
YOU DO NOT RECOGNIZE ME
NO
EPONINE
MARIUS BENT HASTILY DOWN
IT WAS IN FACT THAT UNHAPPY CHILD
SHE WAS
DRESSED IN MEN'S CLOTHES
HOW COME YOU HERE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
I AM DYING SAID SHE
THERE ARE WORDS AND INCIDENTS WHICH AROUSE DEJECTED BEINGS
MARIUS CRIED
OUT WITH A START
YOU ARE WOUNDED WAIT I WILL CARRY YOU INTO THE ROOM THEY WILL ATTEND
TO YOU THERE
IS IT SERIOUS HOW MUST I TAKE HOLD OF YOU IN ORDER NOT
TO HURT YOU WHERE DO YOU SUFFER HELP MY GOD BUT WHY DID YOU COME
HITHER
AND HE TRIED TO PASS HIS ARM UNDER HER IN ORDER TO RAISE HER
SHE UTTERED A FEEBLE CRY
HAVE I HURT YOU ASKED MARIUS
A LITTLE
BUT I ONLY TOUCHED YOUR HAND
SHE RAISED HER HAND TO MARIUS AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT HAND MARIUS SAW
A BLACK HOLE
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOUR HAND SAID HE
IT IS PIERCED
PIERCED
YES
WHAT WITH
A BULLET
HOW
DID YOU SEE A GUN AIMED AT YOU
YES AND A HAND STOPPING IT
IT WAS MINE
MARIUS WAS SEIZED WITH A SHUDDER
WHAT MADNESS POOR CHILD BUT SO MUCH THE BETTER IF THAT IS ALL IT IS
NOTHING LET ME CARRY YOU TO A BED
THEY WILL DRESS YOUR WOUND ONE DOES
NOT DIE OF A PIERCED HAND
SHE MURMURED
THE BULLET TRAVERSED MY HAND BUT IT CAME OUT THROUGH MY BACK
IT IS
USELESS TO REMOVE ME FROM THIS SPOT
I WILL TELL YOU HOW YOU CAN CARE
FOR ME BETTER THAN ANY SURGEON
SIT DOWN NEAR ME ON THIS STONE
HE OBEYED SHE LAID HER HEAD ON MARIUS' KNEES AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT
HIM SHE SAID
OH HOW GOOD THIS IS HOW COMFORTABLE THIS IS THERE I NO LONGER
SUFFER
SHE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE TURNED HER FACE WITH AN
EFFORT AND LOOKED AT MARIUS
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MONSIEUR MARIUS IT PUZZLED ME BECAUSE YOU ENTERED
THAT GARDEN IT WAS STUPID BECAUSE IT WAS I WHO SHOWED YOU THAT HOUSE
AND THEN I OUGHT TO HAVE SAID TO MYSELF THAT A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU
SHE PAUSED AND OVERSTEPPING THE SOMBRE TRANSITIONS THAT UNDOUBTEDLY
EXISTED IN HER MIND SHE RESUMED WITH A HEARTRENDING SMILE
YOU THOUGHT ME UGLY DIDN'T YOU
SHE CONTINUED
YOU SEE YOU ARE LOST NOW NO ONE CAN GET OUT OF THE BARRICADE
IT WAS
I WHO LED YOU HERE BY THE WAY YOU ARE GOING TO DIE I COUNT UPON THAT
AND YET WHEN I SAW THEM TAKING AIM AT YOU I PUT MY HAND ON THE MUZZLE
OF THE GUN
HOW QUEER IT IS BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I WANTED TO DIE BEFORE
YOU
WHEN I RECEIVED THAT BULLET I DRAGGED MYSELF HERE NO ONE SAW
ME NO ONE PICKED ME UP I WAS WAITING FOR YOU I SAID 'SO HE IS NOT
COMING OH IF YOU ONLY KNEW
I BIT MY BLOUSE I SUFFERED SO NOW I AM
WELL
DO YOU REMEMBER THE DAY I ENTERED YOUR CHAMBER AND WHEN I
LOOKED AT MYSELF IN YOUR MIRROR AND THE DAY WHEN I CAME TO YOU ON THE
BOULEVARD NEAR THE WASHERWOMEN HOW THE BIRDS SANG THAT WAS A LONG TIME
AGO
YOU GAVE ME A HUNDRED SOUS AND I SAID TO YOU 'I DON'T WANT YOUR
MONEY I HOPE YOU PICKED UP YOUR COIN YOU ARE NOT RICH
I DID NOT
THINK TO TELL YOU TO PICK IT UP
THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHT AND IT WAS
NOT COLD
DO YOU REMEMBER MONSIEUR MARIUS OH HOW HAPPY I AM EVERY
ONE IS GOING TO DIE
SHE HAD A MAD GRAVE AND HEART BREAKING AIR
HER TORN BLOUSE DISCLOSED
HER BARE THROAT
AS SHE TALKED SHE PRESSED HER PIERCED HAND TO HER BREAST WHERE THERE
WAS ANOTHER HOLE AND WHENCE THERE SPURTED FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT A
STREAM OF BLOOD LIKE A JET OF WINE FROM AN OPEN BUNG HOLE
MARIUS GAZED AT THIS UNFORTUNATE CREATURE WITH PROFOUND COMPASSION
OH SHE RESUMED IT IS COMING AGAIN I AM STIFLING
SHE CAUGHT UP HER BLOUSE AND BIT IT AND HER LIMBS STIFFENED ON THE
PAVEMENT
AT THAT MOMENT THE YOUNG COCK'S CROW EXECUTED BY LITTLE GAVROCHE
RESOUNDED THROUGH THE BARRICADE
THE CHILD HAD MOUNTED A TABLE TO LOAD HIS GUN AND WAS SINGING GAYLY THE
SONG THEN SO POPULAR
EN VOYANT LAFAYETTE ON BEHOLDING LAFAYETTE
LE GENDARME REPETE THE GENDARME REPEATS
SAUVONS NOUS SAUVONS NOUS LET US FLEE LET US FLEE
SAUVONS NOUS LET US FLEE
EPONINE RAISED HERSELF AND LISTENED THEN SHE MURMURED
IT IS HE
AND TURNING TO MARIUS
MY BROTHER IS HERE
HE MUST NOT SEE ME
HE WOULD SCOLD ME
YOUR BROTHER INQUIRED MARIUS WHO WAS MEDITATING IN THE MOST BITTER
AND SORROWFUL DEPTHS OF HIS HEART ON THE DUTIES TO THE THENARDIERS WHICH
HIS FATHER HAD BEQUEATHED TO HIM WHO IS YOUR BROTHER
THAT LITTLE FELLOW
THE ONE WHO IS SINGING
YES
MARIUS MADE A MOVEMENT
OH DON'T GO AWAY SAID SHE IT WILL NOT BE LONG NOW
SHE WAS SITTING ALMOST UPRIGHT BUT HER VOICE WAS VERY LOW AND BROKEN BY
HICCOUGHS
AT INTERVALS THE DEATH RATTLE INTERRUPTED HER
SHE PUT HER FACE AS NEAR
THAT OF MARIUS AS POSSIBLE
SHE ADDED WITH A STRANGE EXPRESSION
LISTEN I DO NOT WISH TO PLAY YOU A TRICK
I HAVE A LETTER IN MY POCKET
FOR YOU
I WAS TOLD TO PUT IT IN THE POST
I KEPT IT
I DID NOT WANT TO
HAVE IT REACH YOU
BUT PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR IT WHEN WE
MEET AGAIN PRESENTLY TAKE YOUR LETTER
SHE GRASPED MARIUS' HAND CONVULSIVELY WITH HER PIERCED HAND BUT SHE NO
LONGER SEEMED TO FEEL HER SUFFERINGS
SHE PUT MARIUS' HAND IN THE POCKET
OF HER BLOUSE
THERE IN FACT MARIUS FELT A PAPER
TAKE IT SAID SHE
MARIUS TOOK THE LETTER
SHE MADE A SIGN OF SATISFACTION AND CONTENTMENT
NOW FOR MY TROUBLE PROMISE ME
AND SHE STOPPED
WHAT ASKED MARIUS
PROMISE ME
I PROMISE
PROMISE TO GIVE ME A KISS ON MY BROW WHEN I AM DEAD I SHALL FEEL IT
SHE DROPPED HER HEAD AGAIN ON MARIUS' KNEES AND HER EYELIDS CLOSED
HE
THOUGHT THE POOR SOUL HAD DEPARTED
EPONINE REMAINED MOTIONLESS
ALL
AT ONCE AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN MARIUS FANCIED HER ASLEEP FOREVER SHE
SLOWLY OPENED HER EYES IN WHICH APPEARED THE SOMBRE PROFUNDITY OF DEATH
AND SAID TO HIM IN A TONE WHOSE SWEETNESS SEEMED ALREADY TO PROCEED FROM
ANOTHER WORLD
AND BY THE WAY MONSIEUR MARIUS I BELIEVE THAT I WAS A LITTLE BIT IN
LOVE WITH YOU
SHE TRIED TO SMILE ONCE MORE AND EXPIRED
CHAPTER VII GAVROCHE AS A PROFOUND CALCULATOR OF DISTANCES
MARIUS KEPT HIS PROMISE
HE DROPPED A KISS ON THAT LIVID BROW WHERE THE
ICY PERSPIRATION STOOD IN BEADS
THIS WAS NO INFIDELITY TO COSETTE IT WAS A GENTLE AND PENSIVE FAREWELL
TO AN UNHAPPY SOUL
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT A TREMOR THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE LETTER WHICH EPONINE
HAD GIVEN HIM
HE HAD IMMEDIATELY FELT THAT IT WAS AN EVENT OF WEIGHT
HE WAS IMPATIENT TO READ IT
THE HEART OF MAN IS SO CONSTITUTED THAT THE
UNHAPPY CHILD HAD HARDLY CLOSED HER EYES WHEN MARIUS BEGAN TO THINK OF
UNFOLDING THIS PAPER
HE LAID HER GENTLY ON THE GROUND AND WENT AWAY
SOMETHING TOLD HIM THAT
HE COULD NOT PERUSE THAT LETTER IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT BODY
HE DREW NEAR TO A CANDLE IN THE TAP ROOM
IT WAS A SMALL NOTE FOLDED
AND SEALED WITH A WOMAN'S ELEGANT CARE
THE ADDRESS WAS IN A WOMAN'S
HAND AND RAN
TO MONSIEUR MONSIEUR MARIUS PONTMERCY AT M
COURFEYRAC'S RUE DE LA
VERRERIE NO
16
HE BROKE THE SEAL AND READ
MY DEAREST ALAS MY FATHER INSISTS ON OUR SETTING OUT IMMEDIATELY
WE SHALL BE THIS EVENING IN THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME NO
7
IN A WEEK WE SHALL BE IN ENGLAND
COSETTE
JUNE 4TH
SUCH WAS THE INNOCENCE OF THEIR LOVE THAT MARIUS WAS NOT EVEN ACQUAINTED
WITH COSETTE'S HANDWRITING
WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE MAY BE RELATED IN A FEW WORDS
EPONINE HAD BEEN
THE CAUSE OF EVERYTHING
AFTER THE EVENING OF THE 3D OF JUNE SHE HAD
CHERISHED A DOUBLE IDEA TO DEFEAT THE PROJECTS OF HER FATHER AND THE
RUFFIANS ON THE HOUSE OF THE RUE PLUMET AND TO SEPARATE MARIUS AND
COSETTE
SHE HAD EXCHANGED RAGS WITH THE FIRST YOUNG SCAMP SHE CAME
ACROSS WHO HAD THOUGHT IT AMUSING TO DRESS LIKE A WOMAN WHILE EPONINE
DISGUISED HERSELF LIKE A MAN
IT WAS SHE WHO HAD CONVEYED TO JEAN
VALJEAN IN THE CHAMP DE MARS THE EXPRESSIVE WARNING LEAVE YOUR HOUSE
JEAN VALJEAN HAD IN FACT RETURNED HOME AND HAD SAID TO COSETTE
WE SET OUT THIS EVENING AND WE GO TO THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME WITH
TOUSSAINT
NEXT WEEK WE SHALL BE IN LONDON COSETTE UTTERLY
OVERWHELMED BY THIS UNEXPECTED BLOW HAD HASTILY PENNED A COUPLE OF
LINES TO MARIUS
BUT HOW WAS SHE TO GET THE LETTER TO THE POST SHE
NEVER WENT OUT ALONE AND TOUSSAINT SURPRISED AT SUCH A COMMISSION
WOULD CERTAINLY SHOW THE LETTER TO M
FAUCHELEVENT
IN THIS DILEMMA
COSETTE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT THROUGH THE FENCE OF EPONINE IN MAN'S CLOTHES
WHO NOW PROWLED INCESSANTLY AROUND THE GARDEN
COSETTE HAD CALLED TO
THIS YOUNG WORKMAN AND HAD HANDED HIM FIVE FRANCS AND THE LETTER
SAYING CARRY THIS LETTER IMMEDIATELY TO ITS ADDRESS EPONINE HAD PUT
THE LETTER IN HER POCKET
THE NEXT DAY ON THE 5TH OF JUNE SHE WENT
TO COURFEYRAC'S QUARTERS TO INQUIRE FOR MARIUS NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF
DELIVERING THE LETTER BUT A THING WHICH EVERY JEALOUS AND LOVING SOUL
WILL COMPREHEND TO SEE THERE SHE HAD WAITED FOR MARIUS OR AT LEAST
FOR COURFEYRAC STILL FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEING
WHEN COURFEYRAC HAD
TOLD HER WE ARE GOING TO THE BARRICADES AN IDEA FLASHED THROUGH HER
MIND TO FLING HERSELF INTO THAT DEATH AS SHE WOULD HAVE DONE INTO ANY
OTHER AND TO THRUST MARIUS INTO IT ALSO
SHE HAD FOLLOWED COURFEYRAC
HAD MADE SURE OF THE LOCALITY WHERE THE BARRICADE WAS IN PROCESS OF
CONSTRUCTION AND QUITE CERTAIN SINCE MARIUS HAD RECEIVED NO WARNING
AND SINCE SHE HAD INTERCEPTED THE LETTER THAT HE WOULD GO AT DUSK TO
HIS TRYSTING PLACE FOR EVERY EVENING SHE HAD BETAKEN HERSELF TO THE RUE
PLUMET HAD THERE AWAITED MARIUS AND HAD SENT HIM IN THE NAME OF HIS
FRIENDS THE APPEAL WHICH WOULD SHE THOUGHT LEAD HIM TO THE BARRICADE
SHE RECKONED ON MARIUS' DESPAIR WHEN HE SHOULD FAIL TO FIND COSETTE SHE
WAS NOT MISTAKEN
SHE HAD RETURNED TO THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE HERSELF
WHAT SHE DID THERE THE READER HAS JUST SEEN
SHE DIED WITH THE TRAGIC
JOY OF JEALOUS HEARTS WHO DRAG THE BELOVED BEING INTO THEIR OWN DEATH
AND WHO SAY NO ONE SHALL HAVE HIM
MARIUS COVERED COSETTE'S LETTER WITH KISSES
SO SHE LOVED HIM FOR ONE
MOMENT THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO DIE NOW
THEN
HE SAID TO HIMSELF SHE IS GOING AWAY
HER FATHER IS TAKING HER TO
ENGLAND AND MY GRANDFATHER REFUSES HIS CONSENT TO THE MARRIAGE
NOTHING
IS CHANGED IN OUR FATES DREAMERS LIKE MARIUS ARE SUBJECT TO SUPREME
ATTACKS OF DEJECTION AND DESPERATE RESOLVES ARE THE RESULT
THE FATIGUE
OF LIVING IS INSUPPORTABLE DEATH IS SOONER OVER WITH
THEN HE REFLECTED
THAT HE HAD STILL TWO DUTIES TO FULFIL TO INFORM COSETTE OF HIS
DEATH AND SEND HER A FINAL FAREWELL AND TO SAVE FROM THE IMPENDING
CATASTROPHE WHICH WAS IN PREPARATION THAT POOR CHILD EPONINE'S BROTHER
AND THENARDIER'S SON
HE HAD A POCKET BOOK ABOUT HIM THE SAME ONE WHICH HAD CONTAINED
THE NOTE BOOK IN WHICH HE HAD INSCRIBED SO MANY THOUGHTS OF LOVE FOR
COSETTE
HE TORE OUT A LEAF AND WROTE ON IT A FEW LINES IN PENCIL
OUR MARRIAGE WAS IMPOSSIBLE
I ASKED MY GRANDFATHER HE REFUSED I HAVE
NO FORTUNE NEITHER HAST THOU
I HASTENED TO THEE THOU WERT NO LONGER
THERE
THOU KNOWEST THE PROMISE THAT I GAVE THEE I SHALL KEEP IT
I
DIE
I LOVE THEE
WHEN THOU READEST THIS MY SOUL WILL BE NEAR THEE AND
THOU WILT SMILE
HAVING NOTHING WHEREWITH TO SEAL THIS LETTER HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH
FOLDING THE PAPER IN FOUR AND ADDED THE ADDRESS
TO MADEMOISELLE COSETTE FAUCHELEVENT AT M
FAUCHELEVENT'S RUE DE
L'HOMME ARME NO
7
HAVING FOLDED THE LETTER HE STOOD IN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT DREW OUT
HIS POCKET BOOK AGAIN OPENED IT AND WROTE WITH THE SAME PENCIL THESE
FOUR LINES ON THE FIRST PAGE
MY NAME IS MARIUS PONTMERCY
CARRY MY BODY TO MY GRANDFATHER M
GILLENORMAND RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE NO
6 IN THE MARAIS
HE PUT HIS POCKETBOOK BACK IN HIS POCKET THEN HE CALLED GAVROCHE
THE GAMIN AT THE SOUND OF MARIUS' VOICE RAN UP TO HIM WITH HIS MERRY
AND DEVOTED AIR
WILL YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME
ANYTHING SAID GAVROCHE
GOOD GOD IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR YOU I
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FOR
DO YOU SEE THIS LETTER
YES
TAKE IT
LEAVE THE BARRICADE INSTANTLY GAVROCHE BEGAN TO SCRATCH HIS
EAR UNEASILY AND TO MORROW MORNING YOU WILL DELIVER IT AT ITS ADDRESS
TO MADEMOISELLE COSETTE AT M
FAUCHELEVENT'S RUE DE L'HOMME ARME NO
7
THE HEROIC CHILD REPLIED
WELL BUT IN THE MEANWHILE THE BARRICADE WILL BE TAKEN AND I SHALL
NOT BE THERE
THE BARRICADE WILL NOT BE ATTACKED UNTIL DAYBREAK ACCORDING TO ALL
APPEARANCES AND WILL NOT BE TAKEN BEFORE TO MORROW NOON
THE FRESH RESPITE WHICH THE ASSAILANTS WERE GRANTING TO THE BARRICADE
HAD IN FACT BEEN PROLONGED
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE INTERMISSIONS WHICH
FREQUENTLY OCCUR IN NOCTURNAL COMBATS WHICH ARE ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY AN
INCREASE OF RAGE
WELL SAID GAVROCHE WHAT IF I WERE TO GO AND CARRY YOUR LETTER
TO MORROW
IT WILL BE TOO LATE
THE BARRICADE WILL PROBABLY BE BLOCKADED ALL
THE STREETS WILL BE GUARDED AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT
GO AT
ONCE
GAVROCHE COULD THINK OF NO REPLY TO THIS AND STOOD THERE IN INDECISION
SCRATCHING HIS EAR SADLY
ALL AT ONCE HE TOOK THE LETTER WITH ONE OF THOSE BIRDLIKE MOVEMENTS
WHICH WERE COMMON WITH HIM
ALL RIGHT SAID HE
AND HE STARTED OFF AT A RUN THROUGH MONDETOUR LANE
AN IDEA HAD OCCURRED TO GAVROCHE WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM TO A DECISION
BUT HE HAD NOT MENTIONED IT FOR FEAR THAT MARIUS MIGHT OFFER SOME
OBJECTION TO IT
THIS WAS THE IDEA
IT IS BARELY MIDNIGHT THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME IS NOT FAR OFF I WILL
GO AND DELIVER THE LETTER AT ONCE AND I SHALL GET BACK IN TIME
BOOK FIFTEENTH THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME
CHAPTER I A DRINKER IS A BABBLER
WHAT ARE THE CONVULSIONS OF A CITY IN COMPARISON WITH THE INSURRECTIONS
OF THE SOUL MAN IS A DEPTH STILL GREATER THAN THE PEOPLE
JEAN VALJEAN
AT THAT VERY MOMENT WAS THE PREY OF A TERRIBLE UPHEAVAL
EVERY SORT OF
GULF HAD OPENED AGAIN WITHIN HIM
HE ALSO WAS TREMBLING LIKE PARIS
ON THE BRINK OF AN OBSCURE AND FORMIDABLE REVOLUTION
A FEW HOURS
HAD SUFFICED TO BRING THIS ABOUT
HIS DESTINY AND HIS CONSCIENCE HAD
SUDDENLY BEEN COVERED WITH GLOOM
OF HIM ALSO AS WELL AS OF PARIS IT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID TWO PRINCIPLES ARE FACE TO FACE
THE WHITE ANGEL
AND THE BLACK ANGEL ARE ABOUT TO SEIZE EACH OTHER ON THE BRIDGE OF THE
ABYSS
WHICH OF THE TWO WILL HURL THE OTHER OVER WHO WILL CARRY THE
DAY
ON THE EVENING PRECEDING THIS SAME 5TH OF JUNE JEAN VALJEAN
ACCOMPANIED BY COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT HAD INSTALLED HIMSELF IN THE RUE DE
L'HOMME ARME
A CHANGE AWAITED HIM THERE
COSETTE HAD NOT QUITTED THE RUE PLUMET WITHOUT MAKING AN EFFORT AT
RESISTANCE
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THEY HAD LIVED SIDE BY SIDE
COSETTE'S WILL AND THE WILL OF JEAN VALJEAN HAD PROVED TO BE DISTINCT
AND HAD BEEN IN OPPOSITION AT LEAST IF THEY HAD NOT CLASHED
THERE HAD
BEEN OBJECTIONS ON ONE SIDE AND INFLEXIBILITY ON THE OTHER
THE ABRUPT
ADVICE LEAVE YOUR HOUSE HURLED AT JEAN VALJEAN BY A STRANGER HAD
ALARMED HIM TO THE EXTENT OF RENDERING HIM PEREMPTORY
HE THOUGHT THAT
HE HAD BEEN TRACED AND FOLLOWED
COSETTE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO GIVE WAY
BOTH HAD ARRIVED IN THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME WITHOUT OPENING THEIR LIPS
AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD EACH BEING ABSORBED IN HIS OWN PERSONAL
PREOCCUPATION JEAN VALJEAN SO UNEASY THAT HE DID NOT NOTICE COSETTE'S
SADNESS COSETTE SO SAD THAT SHE DID NOT NOTICE JEAN VALJEAN'S
UNEASINESS
JEAN VALJEAN HAD TAKEN TOUSSAINT WITH HIM A THING WHICH HE HAD NEVER
DONE IN HIS PREVIOUS ABSENCES
HE PERCEIVED THE POSSIBILITY OF NOT
RETURNING TO THE RUE PLUMET AND HE COULD NEITHER LEAVE TOUSSAINT BEHIND
NOR CONFIDE HIS SECRET TO HER
BESIDES HE FELT THAT SHE WAS DEVOTED AND
TRUSTWORTHY
TREACHERY BETWEEN MASTER AND SERVANT BEGINS IN CURIOSITY
NOW TOUSSAINT AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN DESTINED TO BE JEAN VALJEAN'S
SERVANT WAS NOT CURIOUS
SHE STAMMERED IN HER PEASANT DIALECT OF
BARNEVILLE I AM MADE SO I DO MY WORK THE REST IS NO AFFAIR OF MINE
IN THIS DEPARTURE FROM THE RUE PLUMET WHICH HAD BEEN ALMOST A FLIGHT
JEAN VALJEAN HAD CARRIED AWAY NOTHING BUT THE LITTLE EMBALMED VALISE
BAPTIZED BY COSETTE THE INSEPARABLE FULL TRUNKS WOULD HAVE REQUIRED
PORTERS AND PORTERS ARE WITNESSES
A FIACRE HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO THE
DOOR ON THE RUE DE BABYLONE AND THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT TOUSSAINT HAD OBTAINED PERMISSION TO PACK UP
A LITTLE LINEN AND CLOTHES AND A FEW TOILET ARTICLES
COSETTE HAD TAKEN
ONLY HER PORTFOLIO AND HER BLOTTING BOOK
JEAN VALJEAN WITH A VIEW TO AUGMENTING THE SOLITUDE AND THE MYSTERY OF
THIS DEPARTURE HAD ARRANGED TO QUIT THE PAVILION OF THE RUE PLUMET ONLY
AT DUSK WHICH HAD ALLOWED COSETTE TIME TO WRITE HER NOTE TO MARIUS
THEY HAD ARRIVED IN THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME AFTER NIGHT HAD FULLY
FALLEN
THEY HAD GONE TO BED IN SILENCE
THE LODGINGS IN THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME WERE SITUATED ON A BACK
COURT ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND WERE COMPOSED OF TWO SLEEPING ROOMS A
DINING ROOM AND A KITCHEN ADJOINING THE DINING ROOM WITH A GARRET
WHERE THERE WAS A FOLDING BED AND WHICH FELL TO TOUSSAINT'S SHARE
THE
DINING ROOM WAS AN ANTECHAMBER AS WELL AND SEPARATED THE TWO BEDROOMS
THE APARTMENT WAS PROVIDED WITH ALL NECESSARY UTENSILS
PEOPLE RE ACQUIRE CONFIDENCE AS FOOLISHLY AS THEY LOSE IT HUMAN NATURE
IS SO CONSTITUTED
HARDLY HAD JEAN VALJEAN REACHED THE RUE DE L'HOMME
ARME WHEN HIS ANXIETY WAS LIGHTENED AND BY DEGREES DISSIPATED
THERE
ARE SOOTHING SPOTS WHICH ACT IN SOME SORT MECHANICALLY ON THE MIND
AN OBSCURE STREET PEACEABLE INHABITANTS
JEAN VALJEAN EXPERIENCED AN
INDESCRIBABLE CONTAGION OF TRANQUILLITY IN THAT ALLEY OF ANCIENT PARIS
WHICH IS SO NARROW THAT IT IS BARRED AGAINST CARRIAGES BY A TRANSVERSE
BEAM PLACED ON TWO POSTS WHICH IS DEAF AND DUMB IN THE MIDST OF THE
CLAMOROUS CITY DIMLY LIGHTED AT MID DAY AND IS SO TO SPEAK INCAPABLE
OF EMOTIONS BETWEEN TWO ROWS OF LOFTY HOUSES CENTURIES OLD WHICH HOLD
THEIR PEACE LIKE ANCIENTS AS THEY ARE
THERE WAS A TOUCH OF STAGNANT
OBLIVION IN THAT STREET
JEAN VALJEAN DREW HIS BREATH ONCE MORE THERE
HOW COULD HE BE FOUND THERE
HIS FIRST CARE WAS TO PLACE THE INSEPARABLE BESIDE HIM
HE SLEPT WELL
NIGHT BRINGS WISDOM WE MAY ADD NIGHT SOOTHES
ON THE
FOLLOWING MORNING HE AWOKE IN A MOOD THAT WAS ALMOST GAY
HE THOUGHT THE
DINING ROOM CHARMING THOUGH IT WAS HIDEOUS FURNISHED WITH AN OLD ROUND
TABLE A LONG SIDEBOARD SURMOUNTED BY A SLANTING MIRROR A DILAPIDATED
ARM CHAIR AND SEVERAL PLAIN CHAIRS WHICH WERE ENCUMBERED WITH
TOUSSAINT'S PACKAGES
IN ONE OF THESE PACKAGES JEAN VALJEAN'S UNIFORM OF
A NATIONAL GUARD WAS VISIBLE THROUGH A RENT
AS FOR COSETTE SHE HAD HAD TOUSSAINT TAKE SOME BROTH TO HER ROOM AND
DID NOT MAKE HER APPEARANCE UNTIL EVENING
ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK TOUSSAINT WHO WAS GOING AND COMING AND BUSYING
HERSELF WITH THE TINY ESTABLISHMENT SET ON THE TABLE A COLD CHICKEN
WHICH COSETTE OUT OF DEFERENCE TO HER FATHER CONSENTED TO GLANCE AT
THAT DONE COSETTE UNDER THE PRETEXT OF AN OBSTINATE SICK HEADACHE
HAD BADE JEAN VALJEAN GOOD NIGHT AND HAD SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER CHAMBER
JEAN VALJEAN HAD EATEN A WING OF THE CHICKEN WITH A GOOD APPETITE AND
WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE HAVING GRADUALLY RECOVERED HIS SERENITY
HAD REGAINED POSSESSION OF HIS SENSE OF SECURITY
WHILE HE WAS DISCUSSING THIS MODEST DINNER HE HAD TWICE OR THRICE
NOTICED IN A CONFUSED WAY TOUSSAINT'S STAMMERING WORDS AS SHE SAID
TO HIM MONSIEUR THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON THEY ARE FIGHTING IN
PARIS BUT ABSORBED IN A THRONG OF INWARD CALCULATIONS HE HAD PAID NO
HEED TO IT
TO TELL THE TRUTH HE HAD NOT HEARD HER
HE ROSE AND BEGAN
TO PACE FROM THE DOOR TO THE WINDOW AND FROM THE WINDOW TO THE DOOR
GROWING EVER MORE SERENE
WITH THIS CALM COSETTE HIS SOLE ANXIETY RECURRED TO HIS THOUGHTS
NOT
THAT HE WAS TROUBLED BY THIS HEADACHE A LITTLE NERVOUS CRISIS A YOUNG
GIRL'S FIT OF SULKS THE CLOUD OF A MOMENT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING LEFT
OF IT IN A DAY OR TWO BUT HE MEDITATED ON THE FUTURE AND AS WAS HIS
HABIT HE THOUGHT OF IT WITH PLEASURE
AFTER ALL HE SAW NO OBSTACLE TO
THEIR HAPPY LIFE RESUMING ITS COURSE
AT CERTAIN HOURS EVERYTHING SEEMS
IMPOSSIBLE AT OTHERS EVERYTHING APPEARS EASY JEAN VALJEAN WAS IN THE
MIDST OF ONE OF THESE GOOD HOURS
THEY GENERALLY SUCCEED THE BAD
ONES AS DAY FOLLOWS NIGHT BY VIRTUE OF THAT LAW OF SUCCESSION AND
OF CONTRAST WHICH LIES AT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF NATURE AND WHICH
SUPERFICIAL MINDS CALL ANTITHESIS
IN THIS PEACEFUL STREET WHERE HE HAD
TAKEN REFUGE JEAN VALJEAN GOT RID OF ALL THAT HAD BEEN TROUBLING HIM
FOR SOME TIME PAST
THIS VERY FACT THAT HE HAD SEEN MANY SHADOWS MADE
HIM BEGIN TO PERCEIVE A LITTLE AZURE
TO HAVE QUITTED THE RUE
PLUMET WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS OR INCIDENTS WAS ONE GOOD STEP ALREADY
ACCOMPLISHED
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE WISE TO GO ABROAD IF ONLY FOR A FEW
MONTHS AND TO SET OUT FOR LONDON
WELL THEY WOULD GO
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DID IT MAKE TO HIM WHETHER HE WAS IN FRANCE OR IN ENGLAND PROVIDED HE
HAD COSETTE BESIDE HIM COSETTE WAS HIS NATION
COSETTE SUFFICED FOR
HIS HAPPINESS THE IDEA THAT HE PERHAPS DID NOT SUFFICE FOR COSETTE'S
HAPPINESS THAT IDEA WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN THE CAUSE OF HIS FEVER
AND SLEEPLESSNESS DID NOT EVEN PRESENT ITSELF TO HIS MIND
HE WAS IN A
STATE OF COLLAPSE FROM ALL HIS PAST SUFFERINGS AND HE WAS FULLY ENTERED
ON OPTIMISM
COSETTE WAS BY HIS SIDE SHE SEEMED TO BE HIS AN OPTICAL
ILLUSION WHICH EVERY ONE HAS EXPERIENCED
HE ARRANGED IN HIS OWN MIND
WITH ALL SORTS OF FELICITOUS DEVICES HIS DEPARTURE FOR ENGLAND WITH
COSETTE AND HE BEHELD HIS FELICITY RECONSTITUTED WHEREVER HE PLEASED
IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF HIS REVERY
AS HE PACED TO AND FRO WITH LONG STRIDES HIS GLANCE SUDDENLY
ENCOUNTERED SOMETHING STRANGE
IN THE INCLINED MIRROR FACING HIM WHICH SURMOUNTED THE SIDEBOARD HE SAW
THE FOUR LINES WHICH FOLLOW
MY DEAREST ALAS MY FATHER INSISTS ON OUR SETTING OUT IMMEDIATELY
WE
SHALL BE THIS EVENING IN THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME NO
7
IN A WEEK WE
SHALL BE IN ENGLAND
COSETTE
JUNE 4TH
JEAN VALJEAN HALTED PERFECTLY HAGGARD
COSETTE ON HER ARRIVAL HAD PLACED HER BLOTTING BOOK ON THE SIDEBOARD IN
FRONT OF THE MIRROR AND UTTERLY ABSORBED IN HER AGONY OF GRIEF HAD
FORGOTTEN IT AND LEFT IT THERE WITHOUT EVEN OBSERVING THAT SHE HAD LEFT
IT WIDE OPEN AND OPEN AT PRECISELY THE PAGE ON WHICH SHE HAD LAID TO
DRY THE FOUR LINES WHICH SHE HAD PENNED AND WHICH SHE HAD GIVEN IN
CHARGE OF THE YOUNG WORKMAN IN THE RUE PLUMET
THE WRITING HAD BEEN
PRINTED OFF ON THE BLOTTER
THE MIRROR REFLECTED THE WRITING
THE RESULT WAS WHAT IS CALLED IN GEOMETRY THE SYMMETRICAL IMAGE SO
THAT THE WRITING REVERSED ON THE BLOTTER WAS RIGHTED IN THE MIRROR AND
PRESENTED ITS NATURAL APPEARANCE AND JEAN VALJEAN HAD BENEATH HIS EYES
THE LETTER WRITTEN BY COSETTE TO MARIUS ON THE PRECEDING EVENING
IT WAS SIMPLE AND WITHERING
JEAN VALJEAN STEPPED UP TO THE MIRROR
HE READ THE FOUR LINES AGAIN BUT
HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEM
THEY PRODUCED ON HIM THE EFFECT OF APPEARING IN
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING
IT WAS A HALLUCINATION IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
IT WAS
NOT SO
LITTLE BY LITTLE HIS PERCEPTIONS BECAME MORE PRECISE HE LOOKED AT
COSETTE'S BLOTTING BOOK AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE REALITY RETURNED
TO HIM
HE CAUGHT UP THE BLOTTER AND SAID IT COMES FROM THERE
HE FEVERISHLY EXAMINED THE FOUR LINES IMPRINTED ON THE BLOTTER THE
REVERSAL OF THE LETTERS CONVERTED INTO AN ODD SCRAWL AND HE SAW NO
SENSE IN IT
THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT THIS SIGNIFIES NOTHING THERE
IS NOTHING WRITTEN HERE AND HE DREW A LONG BREATH WITH INEXPRESSIBLE
RELIEF
WHO HAS NOT EXPERIENCED THOSE FOOLISH JOYS IN HORRIBLE INSTANTS
THE SOUL DOES NOT SURRENDER TO DESPAIR UNTIL IT HAS EXHAUSTED ALL
ILLUSIONS
HE HELD THE BLOTTER IN HIS HAND AND CONTEMPLATED IT IN STUPID DELIGHT
ALMOST READY TO LAUGH AT THE HALLUCINATION OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN THE
DUPE
ALL AT ONCE HIS EYES FELL UPON THE MIRROR AGAIN AND AGAIN HE
BEHELD THE VISION
THERE WERE THE FOUR LINES OUTLINED WITH INEXORABLE
CLEARNESS
THIS TIME IT WAS NO MIRAGE
THE RECURRENCE OF A VISION IS A
REALITY IT WAS PALPABLE IT WAS THE WRITING RESTORED IN THE MIRROR
HE
UNDERSTOOD
JEAN VALJEAN TOTTERED DROPPED THE BLOTTER AND FELL INTO THE OLD
ARM CHAIR BESIDE THE BUFFET WITH DROOPING HEAD AND GLASSY EYES IN
UTTER BEWILDERMENT
HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE LIGHT OF
THE WORLD HAD BEEN ECLIPSED FOREVER AND THAT COSETTE HAD WRITTEN THAT
TO SOME ONE
THEN HE HEARD HIS SOUL WHICH HAD BECOME TERRIBLE ONCE
MORE GIVE VENT TO A DULL ROAR IN THE GLOOM
TRY THEN THE EFFECT OF
TAKING FROM THE LION THE DOG WHICH HE HAS IN HIS CAGE
STRANGE AND SAD TO SAY AT THAT VERY MOMENT MARIUS HAD NOT YET RECEIVED
COSETTE'S LETTER CHANCE HAD TREACHEROUSLY CARRIED IT TO JEAN VALJEAN
BEFORE DELIVERING IT TO MARIUS
UP TO THAT DAY JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT
BEEN VANQUISHED BY TRIAL
HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO FEARFUL PROOFS NO
VIOLENCE OF BAD FORTUNE HAD BEEN SPARED HIM THE FEROCITY OF FATE ARMED
WITH ALL VINDICTIVENESS AND ALL SOCIAL SCORN HAD TAKEN HIM FOR HER PREY
AND HAD RAGED AGAINST HIM
HE HAD ACCEPTED EVERY EXTREMITY WHEN IT HAD
BEEN NECESSARY HE HAD SACRIFICED HIS INVIOLABILITY AS A REFORMED MAN
HAD YIELDED UP HIS LIBERTY RISKED HIS HEAD LOST EVERYTHING SUFFERED
EVERYTHING AND HE HAD REMAINED DISINTERESTED AND STOICAL TO SUCH A
POINT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT TO BE ABSENT FROM HIMSELF LIKE A
MARTYR
HIS CONSCIENCE INURED TO EVERY ASSAULT OF DESTINY MIGHT HAVE
APPEARED TO BE FOREVER IMPREGNABLE
WELL ANY ONE WHO HAD BEHELD HIS
SPIRITUAL SELF WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO CONCEDE THAT IT WEAKENED AT
THAT MOMENT
IT WAS BECAUSE OF ALL THE TORTURES WHICH HE HAD UNDERGONE
IN THE COURSE OF THIS LONG INQUISITION TO WHICH DESTINY HAD DOOMED HIM
THIS WAS THE MOST TERRIBLE
NEVER HAD SUCH PINCERS SEIZED HIM HITHERTO
HE FELT THE MYSTERIOUS STIRRING OF ALL HIS LATENT SENSIBILITIES
HE FELT
THE PLUCKING AT THE STRANGE CHORD
ALAS THE SUPREME TRIAL LET US SAY
RATHER THE ONLY TRIAL IS THE LOSS OF THE BELOVED BEING
POOR OLD JEAN VALJEAN CERTAINLY DID NOT LOVE COSETTE OTHERWISE THAN AS
A FATHER BUT WE HAVE ALREADY REMARKED ABOVE THAT INTO THIS PATERNITY
THE WIDOWHOOD OF HIS LIFE HAD INTRODUCED ALL THE SHADES OF LOVE HE
LOVED COSETTE AS HIS DAUGHTER AND HE LOVED HER AS HIS MOTHER AND HE
LOVED HER AS HIS SISTER AND AS HE HAD NEVER HAD EITHER A WOMAN TO
LOVE OR A WIFE AS NATURE IS A CREDITOR WHO ACCEPTS NO PROTEST THAT
SENTIMENT ALSO THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE WAS MINGLED WITH THE
REST VAGUE IGNORANT PURE WITH THE PURITY OF BLINDNESS UNCONSCIOUS
CELESTIAL ANGELIC DIVINE LESS LIKE A SENTIMENT THAN LIKE AN INSTINCT
LESS LIKE AN INSTINCT THAN LIKE AN IMPERCEPTIBLE AND INVISIBLE BUT REAL
ATTRACTION AND LOVE PROPERLY SPEAKING WAS IN HIS IMMENSE TENDERNESS
FOR COSETTE LIKE THE THREAD OF GOLD IN THE MOUNTAIN CONCEALED AND
VIRGIN
LET THE READER RECALL THE SITUATION OF HEART WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY
INDICATED
NO MARRIAGE WAS POSSIBLE BETWEEN THEM NOT EVEN THAT OF
SOULS AND YET IT IS CERTAIN THAT THEIR DESTINIES WERE WEDDED
WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF COSETTE THAT IS TO SAY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A CHILDHOOD
JEAN VALJEAN HAD NEVER IN THE WHOLE OF HIS LONG LIFE KNOWN ANYTHING OF
THAT WHICH MAY BE LOVED
THE PASSIONS AND LOVES WHICH SUCCEED EACH OTHER
HAD NOT PRODUCED IN HIM THOSE SUCCESSIVE GREEN GROWTHS TENDER GREEN OR
DARK GREEN WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN FOLIAGE WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE WINTER
AND IN MEN WHO PASS FIFTY
IN SHORT AND WE HAVE INSISTED ON IT MORE
THAN ONCE ALL THIS INTERIOR FUSION ALL THIS WHOLE OF WHICH THE SUM
TOTAL WAS A LOFTY VIRTUE ENDED IN RENDERING JEAN VALJEAN A FATHER TO
COSETTE
A STRANGE FATHER FORGED FROM THE GRANDFATHER THE SON THE
BROTHER AND THE HUSBAND THAT EXISTED IN JEAN VALJEAN A FATHER IN WHOM
THERE WAS INCLUDED EVEN A MOTHER A FATHER WHO LOVED COSETTE AND ADORED
HER AND WHO HELD THAT CHILD AS HIS LIGHT HIS HOME HIS FAMILY HIS
COUNTRY HIS PARADISE
THUS WHEN HE SAW THAT THE END HAD ABSOLUTELY COME THAT SHE WAS ESCAPING
FROM HIM THAT SHE WAS SLIPPING FROM HIS HANDS THAT SHE WAS GLIDING
FROM HIM LIKE A CLOUD LIKE WATER WHEN HE HAD BEFORE HIS EYES THIS
CRUSHING PROOF ANOTHER IS THE GOAL OF HER HEART ANOTHER IS THE WISH
OF HER LIFE THERE IS A DEAREST ONE I AM NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT HER
FATHER I NO LONGER EXIST WHEN HE COULD NO LONGER DOUBT WHEN HE
SAID TO HIMSELF SHE IS GOING AWAY FROM ME THE GRIEF WHICH HE FELT
SURPASSED THE BOUNDS OF POSSIBILITY
TO HAVE DONE ALL THAT HE HAD DONE
FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENDING LIKE THIS AND THE VERY IDEA OF BEING NOTHING
THEN AS WE HAVE JUST SAID A QUIVER OF REVOLT RAN THROUGH HIM FROM
HEAD TO FOOT
HE FELT EVEN IN THE VERY ROOTS OF HIS HAIR THE IMMENSE
REAWAKENING OF EGOTISM AND THE I IN THIS MAN'S ABYSS HOWLED
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS THE SUDDEN GIVING WAY OF THE INWARD SUBSOIL
A
DESPAIRING CERTAINTY DOES NOT MAKE ITS WAY INTO A MAN WITHOUT THRUSTING
ASIDE AND BREAKING CERTAIN PROFOUND ELEMENTS WHICH IN SOME CASES ARE
THE VERY MAN HIMSELF
GRIEF WHEN IT ATTAINS THIS SHAPE IS A HEADLONG
FLIGHT OF ALL THE FORCES OF THE CONSCIENCE
THESE ARE FATAL CRISES
FEW
AMONG US EMERGE FROM THEM STILL LIKE OURSELVES AND FIRM IN DUTY
WHEN
THE LIMIT OF ENDURANCE IS OVERSTEPPED THE MOST IMPERTURBABLE VIRTUE IS
DISCONCERTED
JEAN VALJEAN TOOK THE BLOTTER AGAIN AND CONVINCED HIMSELF
AFRESH HE REMAINED BOWED AND AS THOUGH PETRIFIED AND WITH STARING EYES
OVER THOSE FOUR UNOBJECTIONABLE LINES AND THERE AROSE WITHIN HIM SUCH
A CLOUD THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING IN THIS SOUL WAS
CRUMBLING AWAY
HE EXAMINED THIS REVELATION ATHWART THE EXAGGERATIONS OF REVERY WITH
AN APPARENT AND TERRIFYING CALMNESS FOR IT IS A FEARFUL THING WHEN A
MAN'S CALMNESS REACHES THE COLDNESS OF THE STATUE
HE MEASURED THE TERRIBLE STEP WHICH HIS DESTINY HAD TAKEN WITHOUT HIS
HAVING A SUSPICION OF THE FACT HE RECALLED HIS FEARS OF THE PRECEDING
SUMMER SO FOOLISHLY DISSIPATED HE RECOGNIZED THE PRECIPICE IT WAS
STILL THE SAME ONLY JEAN VALJEAN WAS NO LONGER ON THE BRINK HE WAS AT
THE BOTTOM OF IT
THE UNPRECEDENTED AND HEART RENDING THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT HE HAD
FALLEN WITHOUT PERCEIVING IT
ALL THE LIGHT OF HIS LIFE HAD DEPARTED
WHILE HE STILL FANCIED THAT HE BEHELD THE SUN
HIS INSTINCT DID NOT HESITATE
HE PUT TOGETHER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
CERTAIN DATES CERTAIN BLUSHES AND CERTAIN PALLORS ON COSETTE'S PART
AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF IT IS HE
THE DIVINATION OF DESPAIR IS A SORT OF MYSTERIOUS BOW WHICH NEVER MISSES
ITS AIM
HE STRUCK MARIUS WITH HIS FIRST CONJECTURE
HE DID NOT KNOW THE
NAME BUT HE FOUND THE MAN INSTANTLY
HE DISTINCTLY PERCEIVED IN THE
BACKGROUND OF THE IMPLACABLE CONJURATION OF HIS MEMORIES THE UNKNOWN
PROWLER OF THE LUXEMBOURG THAT WRETCHED SEEKER OF LOVE ADVENTURES THAT
IDLER OF ROMANCE THAT IDIOT THAT COWARD FOR IT IS COWARDLY TO COME
AND MAKE EYES AT YOUNG GIRLS WHO HAVE BESIDE THEM A FATHER WHO LOVES
THEM
AFTER HE HAD THOROUGHLY VERIFIED THE FACT THAT THIS YOUNG MAN WAS AT
THE BOTTOM OF THIS SITUATION AND THAT EVERYTHING PROCEEDED FROM THAT
QUARTER HE JEAN VALJEAN THE REGENERATED MAN THE MAN WHO HAD SO
LABORED OVER HIS SOUL THE MAN WHO HAD MADE SO MANY EFFORTS TO RESOLVE
ALL LIFE ALL MISERY AND ALL UNHAPPINESS INTO LOVE LOOKED INTO HIS OWN
BREAST AND THERE BEHELD A SPECTRE HATE
GREAT GRIEFS CONTAIN SOMETHING OF DEJECTION
THEY DISCOURAGE ONE WITH
EXISTENCE
THE MAN INTO WHOM THEY ENTER FEELS SOMETHING WITHIN HIM
WITHDRAW FROM HIM
IN HIS YOUTH THEIR VISITS ARE LUGUBRIOUS LATER ON
THEY ARE SINISTER
ALAS IF DESPAIR IS A FEARFUL THING WHEN THE BLOOD IS
HOT WHEN THE HAIR IS BLACK WHEN THE HEAD IS ERECT ON THE BODY LIKE
THE FLAME ON THE TORCH WHEN THE ROLL OF DESTINY STILL RETAINS ITS FULL
THICKNESS WHEN THE HEART FULL OF DESIRABLE LOVE STILL POSSESSES BEATS
WHICH CAN BE RETURNED TO IT WHEN ONE HAS TIME FOR REDRESS WHEN ALL
WOMEN AND ALL SMILES AND ALL THE FUTURE AND ALL THE HORIZON ARE BEFORE
ONE WHEN THE FORCE OF LIFE IS COMPLETE WHAT IS IT IN OLD AGE WHEN
THE YEARS HASTEN ON GROWING EVER PALER TO THAT TWILIGHT HOUR WHEN ONE
BEGINS TO BEHOLD THE STARS OF THE TOMB
WHILE HE WAS MEDITATING TOUSSAINT ENTERED
JEAN VALJEAN ROSE AND ASKED
HER
IN WHAT QUARTER IS IT DO YOU KNOW
TOUSSAINT WAS STRUCK DUMB AND COULD ONLY ANSWER HIM
WHAT IS IT SIR
JEAN VALJEAN BEGAN AGAIN DID YOU NOT TELL ME THAT JUST NOW THAT THERE
IS FIGHTING GOING ON
AH YES SIR REPLIED TOUSSAINT
IT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF
SAINT MERRY
THERE IS A MECHANICAL MOVEMENT WHICH COMES TO US UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM
THE MOST PROFOUND DEPTHS OF OUR THOUGHT
IT WAS NO DOUBT UNDER
THE IMPULSE OF A MOVEMENT OF THIS SORT AND OF WHICH HE WAS HARDLY
CONSCIOUS THAT JEAN VALJEAN FIVE MINUTES LATER FOUND HIMSELF IN THE
STREET
BAREHEADED HE SAT UPON THE STONE POST AT THE DOOR OF HIS HOUSE
HE
SEEMED TO BE LISTENING
NIGHT HAD COME
CHAPTER II THE STREET URCHIN AN ENEMY OF LIGHT
HOW LONG DID HE REMAIN THUS WHAT WAS THE EBB AND FLOW OF THIS TRAGIC
MEDITATION DID HE STRAIGHTEN UP DID HE REMAIN BOWED HAD HE BEEN
BENT TO BREAKING COULD HE STILL RISE AND REGAIN HIS FOOTING IN HIS
CONSCIENCE UPON SOMETHING SOLID HE PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
TELL HIMSELF
THE STREET WAS DESERTED
A FEW UNEASY BOURGEOIS WHO WERE RAPIDLY
RETURNING HOME HARDLY SAW HIM
EACH ONE FOR HIMSELF IN TIMES OF PERIL
THE LAMP LIGHTER CAME AS USUAL TO LIGHT THE LANTERN WHICH WAS SITUATED
PRECISELY OPPOSITE THE DOOR OF NO
7 AND THEN WENT AWAY
JEAN VALJEAN
WOULD NOT HAVE APPEARED LIKE A LIVING MAN TO ANY ONE WHO HAD EXAMINED
HIM IN THAT SHADOW
HE SAT THERE ON THE POST OF HIS DOOR MOTIONLESS AS
A FORM OF ICE
THERE IS CONGEALMENT IN DESPAIR
THE ALARM BELLS AND
A VAGUE AND STORMY UPROAR WERE AUDIBLE
IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE
CONVULSIONS OF THE BELL MINGLED WITH THE REVOLT THE CLOCK OF SAINT PAUL
STRUCK ELEVEN GRAVELY AND WITHOUT HASTE FOR THE TOCSIN IS MAN THE
HOUR IS GOD
THE PASSAGE OF THE HOUR PRODUCED NO EFFECT ON JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT STIR
STILL AT ABOUT THAT MOMENT A BRUSQUE REPORT
BURST FORTH IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HALLES A SECOND YET MORE VIOLENT
FOLLOWED IT WAS PROBABLY THAT ATTACK ON THE BARRICADE IN THE RUE DE LA
CHANVRERIE WHICH WE HAVE JUST SEEN REPULSED BY MARIUS
AT THIS DOUBLE
DISCHARGE WHOSE FURY SEEMED AUGMENTED BY THE STUPOR OF THE NIGHT JEAN
VALJEAN STARTED HE ROSE TURNING TOWARDS THE QUARTER WHENCE THE NOISE
PROCEEDED THEN HE FELL BACK UPON THE POST AGAIN FOLDED HIS ARMS AND
HIS HEAD SLOWLY SANK ON HIS BOSOM AGAIN
HE RESUMED HIS GLOOMY DIALOGUE WITH HIMSELF
ALL AT ONCE HE RAISED HIS EYES SOME ONE WAS WALKING IN THE STREET HE
HEARD STEPS NEAR HIM
HE LOOKED AND BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERNS IN
THE DIRECTION OF THE STREET WHICH RAN INTO THE RUE AUX ARCHIVES HE
PERCEIVED A YOUNG LIVID AND BEAMING FACE
GAVROCHE HAD JUST ARRIVED IN THE RUE L'HOMME ARME
GAVROCHE WAS STARING INTO THE AIR APPARENTLY IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING
HE
SAW JEAN VALJEAN PERFECTLY WELL BUT HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIM
GAVROCHE AFTER STARING INTO THE AIR STARED BELOW HE RAISED HIMSELF ON
TIPTOE AND FELT OF THE DOORS AND WINDOWS OF THE GROUND FLOOR THEY WERE
ALL SHUT BOLTED AND PADLOCKED
AFTER HAVING AUTHENTICATED THE FRONTS
OF FIVE OR SIX BARRICADED HOUSES IN THIS MANNER THE URCHIN SHRUGGED HIS
SHOULDERS AND TOOK HIMSELF TO TASK IN THESE TERMS
PARDI
THEN HE BEGAN TO STARE INTO THE AIR AGAIN
JEAN VALJEAN WHO AN INSTANT PREVIOUSLY IN HIS THEN STATE OF MIND
WOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN TO OR EVEN ANSWERED ANY ONE FELT IRRESISTIBLY
IMPELLED TO ACCOST THAT CHILD
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU MY LITTLE FELLOW HE SAID
THE MATTER WITH ME IS THAT I AM HUNGRY REPLIED GAVROCHE FRANKLY
AND
HE ADDED LITTLE FELLOW YOURSELF
JEAN VALJEAN FUMBLED IN HIS FOB AND PULLED OUT A FIVE FRANC PIECE
BUT GAVROCHE WHO WAS OF THE WAGTAIL SPECIES AND WHO SKIPPED
VIVACIOUSLY FROM ONE GESTURE TO ANOTHER HAD JUST PICKED UP A STONE
HE
HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE LANTERN
SEE HERE SAID HE YOU STILL HAVE YOUR LANTERNS HERE
YOU ARE
DISOBEYING THE REGULATIONS MY FRIEND
THIS IS DISORDERLY
SMASH THAT
FOR ME
AND HE FLUNG THE STONE AT THE LANTERN WHOSE BROKEN GLASS FELL WITH
SUCH A CLATTER THAT THE BOURGEOIS IN HIDING BEHIND THEIR CURTAINS IN THE
OPPOSITE HOUSE CRIED THERE IS 'NINETY THREE' COME AGAIN
THE LANTERN OSCILLATED VIOLENTLY AND WENT OUT
THE STREET HAD SUDDENLY
BECOME BLACK
THAT'S RIGHT OLD STREET EJACULATED GAVROCHE PUT ON YOUR
NIGHT CAP
AND TURNING TO JEAN VALJEAN
WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT GIGANTIC MONUMENT THAT YOU HAVE THERE AT THE END
OF THE STREET IT'S THE ARCHIVES ISN'T IT I MUST CRUMBLE UP THOSE BIG
STUPIDS OF PILLARS A BIT AND MAKE A NICE BARRICADE OUT OF THEM
JEAN VALJEAN STEPPED UP TO GAVROCHE
POOR CREATURE HE SAID IN A LOW TONE AND SPEAKING TO HIMSELF HE IS
HUNGRY
AND HE LAID THE HUNDRED SOU PIECE IN HIS HAND
GAVROCHE RAISED HIS FACE ASTONISHED AT THE SIZE OF THIS SOU HE STARED
AT IT IN THE DARKNESS AND THE WHITENESS OF THE BIG SOU DAZZLED HIM
HE KNEW FIVE FRANC PIECES BY HEARSAY THEIR REPUTATION WAS AGREEABLE TO
HIM HE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE ONE CLOSE TO
HE SAID
LET US CONTEMPLATE THE TIGER
HE GAZED AT IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES IN ECSTASY THEN TURNING TO JEAN
VALJEAN HE HELD OUT THE COIN TO HIM AND SAID MAJESTICALLY TO HIM
BOURGEOIS I PREFER TO SMASH LANTERNS
TAKE BACK YOUR FEROCIOUS BEAST
YOU CAN'T BRIBE ME
THAT HAS GOT FIVE CLAWS BUT IT DOESN'T SCRATCH ME
HAVE YOU A MOTHER ASKED JEAN VALJEAN
GAVROCHE REPLIED
MORE THAN YOU HAVE PERHAPS
WELL RETURNED JEAN VALJEAN KEEP THE MONEY FOR YOUR MOTHER
GAVROCHE WAS TOUCHED
MOREOVER HE HAD JUST NOTICED THAT THE MAN WHO WAS
ADDRESSING HIM HAD NO HAT AND THIS INSPIRED HIM WITH CONFIDENCE
TRULY SAID HE SO IT WASN'T TO KEEP ME FROM BREAKING THE LANTERNS
BREAK WHATEVER YOU PLEASE
YOU'RE A FINE MAN SAID GAVROCHE
AND HE PUT THE FIVE FRANC PIECE INTO ONE OF HIS POCKETS
HIS CONFIDENCE HAVING INCREASED HE ADDED
DO YOU BELONG IN THIS STREET
YES WHY
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE NO
7 IS
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH NO
7
HERE THE CHILD PAUSED HE FEARED THAT HE HAD SAID TOO MUCH HE THRUST
HIS NAILS ENERGETICALLY INTO HIS HAIR AND CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH
REPLYING
AH HERE IT IS
AN IDEA FLASHED THROUGH JEAN VALJEAN'S MIND
ANGUISH DOES HAVE THESE
GLEAMS
HE SAID TO THE LAD
ARE YOU THE PERSON WHO IS BRINGING A LETTER THAT I AM EXPECTING
YOU SAID GAVROCHE
YOU ARE NOT A WOMAN
THE LETTER IS FOR MADEMOISELLE COSETTE IS IT NOT
COSETTE MUTTERED GAVROCHE
YES I BELIEVE THAT IS THE QUEER NAME
WELL RESUMED JEAN VALJEAN I AM THE PERSON TO WHOM YOU ARE TO
DELIVER THE LETTER
GIVE IT HERE
IN THAT CASE YOU MUST KNOW THAT I WAS SENT FROM THE BARRICADE
OF COURSE SAID JEAN VALJEAN
GAVROCHE ENGULFED HIS HAND IN ANOTHER OF HIS POCKETS AND DREW OUT A
PAPER FOLDED IN FOUR
THEN HE MADE THE MILITARY SALUTE
RESPECT FOR DESPATCHES SAID HE
IT COMES FROM THE PROVISIONAL
GOVERNMENT
GIVE IT TO ME SAID JEAN VALJEAN
GAVROCHE HELD THE PAPER ELEVATED ABOVE HIS HEAD
DON'T GO AND FANCY IT'S A LOVE LETTER
IT IS FOR A WOMAN BUT IT'S FOR
THE PEOPLE
WE MEN FIGHT AND WE RESPECT THE FAIR SEX
WE ARE NOT AS
THEY ARE IN FINE SOCIETY WHERE THERE ARE LIONS WHO SEND CHICKENS 55 TO
CAMELS
GIVE IT TO ME
AFTER ALL CONTINUED GAVROCHE YOU HAVE THE AIR OF AN HONEST MAN
GIVE IT TO ME QUICK
CATCH HOLD OF IT
AND HE HANDED THE PAPER TO JEAN VALJEAN
AND MAKE HASTE MONSIEUR WHAT'S YOUR NAME FOR MAMSELLE COSETTE IS
WAITING
GAVROCHE WAS SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING PRODUCED THIS REMARK
JEAN VALJEAN BEGAN AGAIN
IS IT TO SAINT MERRY THAT THE ANSWER IS TO BE SENT
THERE YOU ARE MAKING SOME OF THOSE BITS OF PASTRY VULGARLY CALLED
BRIOCHES BLUNDERS
THIS LETTER COMES FROM THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE
LA CHANVRERIE AND I'M GOING BACK THERE
GOOD EVENING CITIZEN
THAT SAID GAVROCHE TOOK HIMSELF OFF OR TO DESCRIBE IT MORE EXACTLY
FLUTTERED AWAY IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE HE HAD COME WITH A FLIGHT LIKE
THAT OF AN ESCAPED BIRD
HE PLUNGED BACK INTO THE GLOOM AS THOUGH HE
MADE A HOLE IN IT WITH THE RIGID RAPIDITY OF A PROJECTILE THE ALLEY OF
L'HOMME ARME BECAME SILENT AND SOLITARY ONCE MORE IN A TWINKLING THAT
STRANGE CHILD WHO HAD ABOUT HIM SOMETHING OF THE SHADOW AND OF THE
DREAM HAD BURIED HIMSELF IN THE MISTS OF THE ROWS OF BLACK HOUSES AND
WAS LOST THERE LIKE SMOKE IN THE DARK AND ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT
HE HAD DISSIPATED AND VANISHED HAD THERE NOT TAKEN PLACE A FEW MINUTES
AFTER HIS DISAPPEARANCE A STARTLING SHIVER OF GLASS AND HAD NOT THE
MAGNIFICENT CRASH OF A LANTERN RATTLING DOWN ON THE PAVEMENT ONCE MORE
ABRUPTLY AWAKENED THE INDIGNANT BOURGEOIS
IT WAS GAVROCHE UPON HIS WAY
THROUGH THE RUE DU CHAUME
CHAPTER III WHILE COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT ARE ASLEEP
JEAN VALJEAN WENT INTO THE HOUSE WITH MARIUS' LETTER
HE GROPED HIS WAY UP THE STAIRS AS PLEASED WITH THE DARKNESS AS AN OWL
WHO GRIPS HIS PREY OPENED AND SHUT HIS DOOR SOFTLY LISTENED TO SEE
WHETHER HE COULD HEAR ANY NOISE MADE SURE THAT TO ALL APPEARANCES
COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT WERE ASLEEP AND PLUNGED THREE OR FOUR MATCHES
INTO THE BOTTLE OF THE FUMADE LIGHTER BEFORE HE COULD EVOKE A SPARK SO
GREATLY DID HIS HAND TREMBLE
WHAT HE HAD JUST DONE SMACKED OF THEFT
AT
LAST THE CANDLE WAS LIGHTED HE LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE UNFOLDED
THE PAPER AND READ
IN VIOLENT EMOTIONS ONE DOES NOT READ ONE FLINGS TO THE EARTH SO TO
SPEAK THE PAPER WHICH ONE HOLDS ONE CLUTCHES IT LIKE A VICTIM ONE
CRUSHES IT ONE DIGS INTO IT THE NAILS OF ONE'S WRATH OR OF ONE'S JOY
ONE HASTENS TO THE END ONE LEAPS TO THE BEGINNING ATTENTION IS AT
FEVER HEAT IT TAKES UP IN THE GROSS AS IT WERE THE ESSENTIAL POINTS
IT SEIZES ON ONE POINT AND THE REST DISAPPEARS
IN MARIUS' NOTE TO
COSETTE JEAN VALJEAN SAW ONLY THESE WORDS
I DIE
WHEN THOU READEST THIS MY SOUL WILL BE NEAR THEE
IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE TWO LINES HE WAS HORRIBLY DAZZLED HE REMAINED
FOR A MOMENT CRUSHED AS IT WERE BY THE CHANGE OF EMOTION WHICH
WAS TAKING PLACE WITHIN HIM HE STARED AT MARIUS' NOTE WITH A SORT OF
INTOXICATED AMAZEMENT HE HAD BEFORE HIS EYES THAT SPLENDOR THE DEATH
OF A HATED INDIVIDUAL
HE UTTERED A FRIGHTFUL CRY OF INWARD JOY
SO IT WAS ALL OVER
THE
CATASTROPHE HAD ARRIVED SOONER THAN HE HAD DARED TO HOPE
THE BEING WHO
OBSTRUCTED HIS DESTINY WAS DISAPPEARING
THAT MAN HAD TAKEN HIMSELF OFF
OF HIS OWN ACCORD FREELY WILLINGLY
THIS MAN WAS GOING TO HIS DEATH
AND HE JEAN VALJEAN HAD HAD NO HAND IN THE MATTER AND IT WAS THROUGH
NO FAULT OF HIS
PERHAPS EVEN HE IS ALREADY DEAD
HERE HIS FEVER
ENTERED INTO CALCULATIONS
NO HE IS NOT DEAD YET
THE LETTER HAD
EVIDENTLY BEEN INTENDED FOR COSETTE TO READ ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
AFTER THE TWO DISCHARGES THAT WERE HEARD BETWEEN ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND
MIDNIGHT NOTHING MORE HAS TAKEN PLACE THE BARRICADE WILL NOT BE
ATTACKED SERIOUSLY UNTIL DAYBREAK BUT THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE FROM
THE MOMENT WHEN THAT MAN IS CONCERNED IN THIS WAR HE IS LOST HE IS
CAUGHT IN THE GEARING
JEAN VALJEAN FELT HIMSELF DELIVERED
SO HE WAS
ABOUT TO FIND HIMSELF ALONE WITH COSETTE ONCE MORE
THE RIVALRY WOULD
CEASE THE FUTURE WAS BEGINNING AGAIN
HE HAD BUT TO KEEP THIS NOTE IN
HIS POCKET
COSETTE WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF THAT MAN
ALL
THAT THERE REQUIRES TO BE DONE IS TO LET THINGS TAKE THEIR OWN COURSE
THIS MAN CANNOT ESCAPE
IF HE IS NOT ALREADY DEAD IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE
IS ABOUT TO DIE
WHAT GOOD FORTUNE
HAVING SAID ALL THIS TO HIMSELF HE BECAME GLOOMY
THEN HE WENT DOWN STAIRS AND WOKE UP THE PORTER
ABOUT AN HOUR LATER JEAN VALJEAN WENT OUT IN THE COMPLETE COSTUME OF
A NATIONAL GUARD AND WITH HIS ARMS
THE PORTER HAD EASILY FOUND IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD THE WHEREWITHAL TO COMPLETE HIS EQUIPMENT
HE HAD A LOADED
GUN AND A CARTRIDGE BOX FILLED WITH CARTRIDGES
HE STRODE OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MARKETS
CHAPTER IV GAVROCHE'S EXCESS OF ZEAL
IN THE MEANTIME GAVROCHE HAD HAD AN ADVENTURE
GAVROCHE AFTER HAVING CONSCIENTIOUSLY STONED THE LANTERN IN THE RUE DU
CHAUME ENTERED THE RUE DES VIELLES HAUDRIETTES AND NOT SEEING EVEN A
CAT THERE HE THOUGHT THE OPPORTUNITY A GOOD ONE TO STRIKE UP ALL THE
SONG OF WHICH HE WAS CAPABLE
HIS MARCH FAR FROM BEING RETARDED BY HIS
SINGING WAS ACCELERATED BY IT
HE BEGAN TO SOW ALONG THE SLEEPING OR

GAVROCHE AS HE SANG WAS LAVISH OF HIS PANTOMIME
GESTURE IS THE STRONG
POINT OF THE REFRAIN
HIS FACE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE REPERTORY OF MASKS
PRODUCED GRIMACES MORE CONVULSING AND MORE FANTASTIC THAN THE RENTS OF A
CLOTH TORN IN A HIGH GALE
UNFORTUNATELY AS HE WAS ALONE AND AS IT WAS
NIGHT THIS WAS NEITHER SEEN NOR EVEN VISIBLE
SUCH WASTES OF RICHES DO
OCCUR
ALL AT ONCE HE STOPPED SHORT
LET US INTERRUPT THE ROMANCE SAID HE
HIS FELINE EYE HAD JUST DESCRIED IN THE RECESS OF A CARRIAGE DOOR
WHAT IS CALLED IN PAINTING AN ENSEMBLE THAT IS TO SAY A PERSON AND
A THING THE THING WAS A HAND CART THE PERSON WAS A MAN FROM AUVERGENE
WHO WAS SLEEPING THEREIN
THE SHAFTS OF THE CART RESTED ON THE PAVEMENT AND THE AUVERGNAT'S HEAD
WAS SUPPORTED AGAINST THE FRONT OF THE CART
HIS BODY WAS COILED UP ON
THIS INCLINED PLANE AND HIS FEET TOUCHED THE GROUND
GAVROCHE WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD RECOGNIZED
A DRUNKEN MAN
HE WAS SOME CORNER ERRAND MAN WHO HAD DRUNK TOO MUCH AND
WAS SLEEPING TOO MUCH
THERE NOW THOUGHT GAVROCHE THAT'S WHAT THE SUMMER NIGHTS ARE GOOD
FOR
WE'LL TAKE THE CART FOR THE REPUBLIC AND LEAVE THE AUVERGNAT FOR
THE MONARCHY
HIS MIND HAD JUST BEEN ILLUMINATED BY THIS FLASH OF LIGHT
HOW BULLY THAT CART WOULD LOOK ON OUR BARRICADE
THE AUVERGNAT WAS SNORING
GAVROCHE GENTLY TUGGED AT THE CART FROM BEHIND AND AT THE AUVERGNAT
FROM THE FRONT THAT IS TO SAY BY THE FEET AND AT THE EXPIRATION OF
ANOTHER MINUTE THE IMPERTURBABLE AUVERGNAT WAS REPOSING FLAT ON THE
PAVEMENT
THE CART WAS FREE
GAVROCHE HABITUATED TO FACING THE UNEXPECTED IN ALL QUARTERS HAD
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM
HE FUMBLED IN ONE OF HIS POCKETS AND PULLED FROM
IT A SCRAP OF PAPER AND A BIT OF RED PENCIL FILCHED FROM SOME CARPENTER
HE WROTE
FRENCH REPUBLIC
RECEIVED THY CART
AND HE SIGNED IT GAVROCHE
THAT DONE HE PUT THE PAPER IN THE POCKET OF THE STILL SNORING
AUVERGNAT'S VELVET VEST SEIZED THE CART SHAFTS IN BOTH HANDS AND SET
OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HALLES PUSHING THE CART BEFORE HIM AT A
HARD GALLOP WITH A GLORIOUS AND TRIUMPHANT UPROAR
THIS WAS PERILOUS
THERE WAS A POST AT THE ROYAL PRINTING ESTABLISHMENT
GAVROCHE DID NOT THINK OF THIS
THIS POST WAS OCCUPIED BY THE NATIONAL
GUARDS OF THE SUBURBS
THE SQUAD BEGAN TO WAKE UP AND HEADS WERE RAISED
FROM CAMP BEDS
TWO STREET LANTERNS BROKEN IN SUCCESSION THAT DITTY
SUNG AT THE TOP OF THE LUNGS
THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL FOR THOSE COWARDLY
STREETS WHICH DESIRE TO GO TO SLEEP AT SUNSET AND WHICH PUT THE
EXTINGUISHER ON THEIR CANDLES AT SUCH AN EARLY HOUR
FOR THE LAST HOUR
THAT BOY HAD BEEN CREATING AN UPROAR IN THAT PEACEABLE ARRONDISSEMENT
THE UPROAR OF A FLY IN A BOTTLE
THE SERGEANT OF THE BANLIEUE LENT AN
EAR
HE WAITED
HE WAS A PRUDENT MAN
THE MAD RATTLE OF THE CART FILLED TO OVERFLOWING THE POSSIBLE MEASURE
OF WAITING AND DECIDED THE SERGEANT TO MAKE A RECONNAISANCE
THERE'S A WHOLE BAND OF THEM THERE SAID HE LET US PROCEED GENTLY
IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE HYDRA OF ANARCHY HAD EMERGED FROM ITS BOX AND THAT
IT WAS STALKING ABROAD THROUGH THE QUARTER
AND THE SERGEANT VENTURED OUT OF THE POST WITH CAUTIOUS TREAD
ALL AT ONCE GAVROCHE PUSHING HIS CART IN FRONT OF HIM AND AT THE VERY
MOMENT WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO TURN INTO THE RUE DES VIELLES HAUDRIETTES
FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A UNIFORM A SHAKO A PLUME AND A GUN
FOR THE SECOND TIME HE STOPPED SHORT
HULLO SAID HE IT'S HIM
GOOD DAY PUBLIC ORDER
GAVROCHE'S AMAZEMENT WAS ALWAYS BRIEF AND SPEEDILY THAWED
WHERE ARE YOU GOING YOU RASCAL SHOUTED THE SERGEANT
CITIZEN RETORTED GAVROCHE I HAVEN'T CALLED YOU 'BOURGEOIS' YET
WHY
DO YOU INSULT ME
WHERE ARE YOU GOING YOU ROGUE
MONSIEUR RETORTED GAVROCHE PERHAPS YOU WERE A MAN OF WIT YESTERDAY
BUT YOU HAVE DEGENERATED THIS MORNING
I ASK YOU WHERE ARE YOU GOING YOU VILLAIN
GAVROCHE REPLIED
YOU SPEAK PRETTILY
REALLY NO ONE WOULD SUPPOSE YOU AS OLD AS YOU ARE
YOU OUGHT TO SELL ALL YOUR HAIR AT A HUNDRED FRANCS APIECE
THAT WOULD
YIELD YOU FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WHERE ARE YOU GOING WHERE ARE YOU GOING BANDIT
GAVROCHE RETORTED AGAIN
WHAT VILLAINOUS WORDS YOU MUST WIPE YOUR MOUTH BETTER THE FIRST TIME
THAT THEY GIVE YOU SUCK
THE SERGEANT LOWERED HIS BAYONET
WILL YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE GOING YOU WRETCH
GENERAL SAID GAVROCHE I'M ON MY WAY TO LOOK FOR A DOCTOR FOR MY WIFE
WHO IS IN LABOR
TO ARMS SHOUTED THE SERGEANT
THE MASTER STROKE OF STRONG MEN CONSISTS IN SAVING THEMSELVES BY THE
VERY MEANS THAT HAVE RUINED THEM GAVROCHE TOOK IN THE WHOLE SITUATION
AT A GLANCE
IT WAS THE CART WHICH HAD TOLD AGAINST HIM IT WAS THE
CART'S PLACE TO PROTECT HIM
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE SERGEANT WAS ON THE POINT OF MAKING HIS DESCENT
ON GAVROCHE THE CART CONVERTED INTO A PROJECTILE AND LAUNCHED WITH ALL
THE LATTER'S MIGHT ROLLED DOWN UPON HIM FURIOUSLY AND THE SERGEANT
STRUCK FULL IN THE STOMACH TUMBLED OVER BACKWARDS INTO THE GUTTER WHILE
HIS GUN WENT OFF IN THE AIR
THE MEN OF THE POST HAD RUSHED OUT PELL MELL AT THE SERGEANT'S SHOUT
THE SHOT BROUGHT ON A GENERAL RANDOM DISCHARGE AFTER WHICH THEY
RELOADED THEIR WEAPONS AND BEGAN AGAIN
THIS BLIND MAN'S BUFF MUSKETRY LASTED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND
KILLED SEVERAL PANES OF GLASS
IN THE MEANWHILE GAVROCHE WHO HAD RETRACED HIS STEPS AT FULL SPEED
HALTED FIVE OR SIX STREETS DISTANT AND SEATED HIMSELF PANTING ON THE
STONE POST WHICH FORMS THE CORNER OF THE ENFANTS ROUGES
HE LISTENED
AFTER PANTING FOR A FEW MINUTES HE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION WHERE THE
FUSILLADE WAS RAGING LIFTED HIS LEFT HAND TO A LEVEL WITH HIS NOSE AND
THRUST IT FORWARD THREE TIMES AS HE SLAPPED THE BACK OF HIS HEAD WITH
HIS RIGHT HAND AN IMPERIOUS GESTURE IN WHICH PARISIAN STREET URCHINDOM
HAS CONDENSED FRENCH IRONY AND WHICH IS EVIDENTLY EFFICACIOUS SINCE IT
HAS ALREADY LASTED HALF A CENTURY
THIS GAYETY WAS TROUBLED BY ONE BITTER REFLECTION
YES SAID HE I'M SPLITTING WITH LAUGHTER I'M TWISTING WITH
DELIGHT I ABOUND IN JOY BUT I'M LOSING MY WAY I SHALL HAVE TO TAKE A
ROUNDABOUT WAY
IF I ONLY REACH THE BARRICADE IN SEASON
THEREUPON HE SET OUT AGAIN ON A RUN
AND AS HE RAN
AH BY THE WAY WHERE WAS I SAID HE
AND HE RESUMED HIS DITTY AS HE PLUNGED RAPIDLY THROUGH THE STREETS AND
THIS IS WHAT DIED AWAY IN THE GLOOM

THE POST'S RECOURSE TO ARMS WAS NOT WITHOUT RESULT
THE CART WAS
CONQUERED THE DRUNKEN MAN WAS TAKEN PRISONER
THE FIRST WAS PUT IN THE
POUND THE SECOND WAS LATER ON SOMEWHAT HARASSED BEFORE THE COUNCILS
OF WAR AS AN ACCOMPLICE
THE PUBLIC MINISTRY OF THE DAY PROVED ITS
INDEFATIGABLE ZEAL IN THE DEFENCE OF SOCIETY IN THIS INSTANCE
GAVROCHE'S ADVENTURE WHICH HAS LINGERED AS A TRADITION IN THE QUARTERS
OF THE TEMPLE IS ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE SOUVENIRS OF THE ELDERLY
BOURGEOIS OF THE MARAIS AND IS ENTITLED IN THEIR MEMORIES THE
NOCTURNAL ATTACK BY THE POST OF THE ROYAL PRINTING ESTABLISHMENT

BOOK FIRST THE WAR BETWEEN FOUR WALLS
CHAPTER I THE CHARYBDIS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE AND THE SCYLLA OF
THE FAUBOURG DU TEMPLE
THE TWO MOST MEMORABLE BARRICADES WHICH THE OBSERVER OF SOCIAL MALADIES
CAN NAME DO NOT BELONG TO THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACTION OF THIS WORK
IS LAID
THESE TWO BARRICADES BOTH OF THEM SYMBOLS UNDER TWO DIFFERENT
ASPECTS OF A REDOUBTABLE SITUATION SPRANG FROM THE EARTH AT THE TIME
OF THE FATAL INSURRECTION OF JUNE 1848 THE GREATEST WAR OF THE STREETS
THAT HISTORY HAS EVER BEHELD
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT EVEN CONTRARY TO PRINCIPLES EVEN CONTRARY TO
LIBERTY EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY EVEN CONTRARY TO THE UNIVERSAL VOTE
EVEN CONTRARY TO THE GOVERNMENT BY ALL FOR ALL FROM THE DEPTHS OF ITS
ANGUISH OF ITS DISCOURAGEMENTS AND ITS DESTITUTIONS OF ITS FEVERS OF
ITS DISTRESSES OF ITS MIASMAS OF ITS IGNORANCES OF ITS DARKNESS THAT
GREAT AND DESPAIRING BODY THE RABBLE PROTESTS AGAINST AND THAT THE
POPULACE WAGES BATTLE AGAINST THE PEOPLE
BEGGARS ATTACK THE COMMON RIGHT THE OCHLOCRACY RISES AGAINST DEMOS
THESE ARE MELANCHOLY DAYS FOR THERE IS ALWAYS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NIGHT
EVEN IN THIS MADNESS THERE IS SUICIDE IN THIS DUEL AND THOSE WORDS
WHICH ARE INTENDED TO BE INSULTS BEGGARS CANAILLE OCHLOCRACY
POPULACE EXHIBIT ALAS RATHER THE FAULT OF THOSE WHO REIGN THAN THE
FAULT OF THOSE WHO SUFFER RATHER THE FAULT OF THE PRIVILEGED THAN THE
FAULT OF THE DISINHERITED
FOR OUR OWN PART WE NEVER PRONOUNCE THOSE WORDS WITHOUT PAIN AND
WITHOUT RESPECT FOR WHEN PHILOSOPHY FATHOMS THE FACTS TO WHICH THEY
CORRESPOND IT OFTEN FINDS MANY A GRANDEUR BESIDE THESE MISERIES
ATHENS
WAS AN OCHLOCRACY THE BEGGARS WERE THE MAKING OF HOLLAND THE POPULACE
SAVED ROME MORE THAN ONCE AND THE RABBLE FOLLOWED JESUS CHRIST
THERE IS NO THINKER WHO HAS NOT AT TIMES CONTEMPLATED THE MAGNIFICENCES
OF THE LOWER CLASSES
IT WAS OF THIS RABBLE THAT SAINT JEROME WAS THINKING NO DOUBT AND OF
ALL THESE POOR PEOPLE AND ALL THESE VAGABONDS AND ALL THESE MISERABLE
PEOPLE WHENCE SPRANG THE APOSTLES AND THE MARTYRS WHEN HE UTTERED THIS
MYSTERIOUS SAYING FEX URBIS LEX ORBIS THE DREGS OF THE CITY THE
LAW OF THE EARTH
THE EXASPERATIONS OF THIS CROWD WHICH SUFFERS AND BLEEDS ITS VIOLENCES
CONTRARY TO ALL SENSE DIRECTED AGAINST THE PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE ITS
LIFE ITS MASTERFUL DEEDS AGAINST THE RIGHT ARE ITS POPULAR COUPS
D'ETAT AND SHOULD BE REPRESSED
THE MAN OF PROBITY SACRIFICES HIMSELF
AND OUT OF HIS VERY LOVE FOR THIS CROWD HE COMBATS IT
BUT HOW
EXCUSABLE HE FEELS IT EVEN WHILE HOLDING OUT AGAINST IT HOW HE
VENERATES IT EVEN WHILE RESISTING IT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE MOMENTS
WHEN WHILE DOING THAT WHICH IT IS ONE'S DUTY TO DO ONE FEELS SOMETHING
WHICH DISCONCERTS ONE AND WHICH WOULD DISSUADE ONE FROM PROCEEDING
FURTHER ONE PERSISTS IT IS NECESSARY BUT CONSCIENCE THOUGH
SATISFIED IS SAD AND THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF DUTY IS COMPLICATED WITH A
PAIN AT THE HEART
JUNE 1848 LET US HASTEN TO SAY WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL FACT AND ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE OF CLASSIFICATION IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY
ALL THE
WORDS WHICH WE HAVE JUST UTTERED MUST BE DISCARDED WHEN IT BECOMES
A QUESTION OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY REVOLT IN WHICH ONE FEELS THE HOLY
ANXIETY OF TOIL CLAIMING ITS RIGHTS
IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMBAT IT AND
THIS WAS A DUTY FOR IT ATTACKED THE REPUBLIC
BUT WHAT WAS JUNE 1848
AT BOTTOM A REVOLT OF THE PEOPLE AGAINST ITSELF
WHERE THE SUBJECT IS NOT LOST SIGHT OF THERE IS NO DIGRESSION MAY WE
THEN BE PERMITTED TO ARREST THE READER'S ATTENTION FOR A MOMENT ON THE
TWO ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE BARRICADES OF WHICH WE HAVE JUST SPOKEN AND WHICH
CHARACTERIZED THIS INSURRECTION
ONE BLOCKED THE ENTRANCE TO THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE THE OTHER
DEFENDED THE APPROACH TO THE FAUBOURG DU TEMPLE THOSE BEFORE WHOM THESE
TWO FEARFUL MASTERPIECES OF CIVIL WAR REARED THEMSELVES BENEATH THE
BRILLIANT BLUE SKY OF JUNE WILL NEVER FORGET THEM
THE SAINT ANTOINE BARRICADE WAS TREMENDOUS IT WAS THREE STORIES HIGH
AND SEVEN HUNDRED FEET WIDE
IT BARRED THE VAST OPENING OF THE FAUBOURG
THAT IS TO SAY THREE STREETS FROM ANGLE TO ANGLE RAVINED JAGGED
CUT UP DIVIDED CRENELATED WITH AN IMMENSE RENT BUTTRESSED WITH PILES
THAT WERE BASTIONS IN THEMSELVES THROWING OUT CAPES HERE AND THERE
POWERFULLY BACKED UP BY TWO GREAT PROMONTORIES OF HOUSES OF THE
FAUBOURG IT REARED ITSELF LIKE A CYCLOPEAN DIKE AT THE END OF THE
FORMIDABLE PLACE WHICH HAD SEEN THE 14TH OF JULY
NINETEEN BARRICADES
WERE RANGED ONE BEHIND THE OTHER IN THE DEPTHS OF THE STREETS
BEHIND THIS PRINCIPAL BARRICADE
AT THE VERY SIGHT OF IT ONE FELT THE
AGONIZING SUFFERING IN THE IMMENSE FAUBOURG WHICH HAD REACHED THAT
POINT OF EXTREMITY WHEN A DISTRESS MAY BECOME A CATASTROPHE
OF WHAT WAS
THAT BARRICADE MADE OF THE RUINS OF THREE SIX STORY HOUSES DEMOLISHED
EXPRESSLY SAID SOME
OF THE PRODIGY OF ALL WRATHS SAID OTHERS
IT WORE
THE LAMENTABLE ASPECT OF ALL CONSTRUCTIONS OF HATRED RUIN
IT MIGHT BE
ASKED WHO BUILT THIS IT MIGHT ALSO BE SAID WHO DESTROYED THIS IT WAS
THE IMPROVISATION OF THE EBULLITION
HOLD TAKE THIS DOOR THIS GRATING
THIS PENTHOUSE THIS CHIMNEY PIECE THIS BROKEN BRAZIER THIS CRACKED
POT GIVE ALL CAST AWAY ALL PUSH THIS ROLL DIG DISMANTLE OVERTURN
RUIN EVERYTHING IT WAS THE COLLABORATION OF THE PAVEMENT THE BLOCK OF
STONE THE BEAM THE BAR OF IRON THE RAG THE SCRAP THE BROKEN PANE
THE UNSEATED CHAIR THE CABBAGE STALK THE TATTER THE RAG AND THE
MALEDICTION
IT WAS GRAND AND IT WAS PETTY
IT WAS THE ABYSS PARODIED
ON THE PUBLIC PLACE BY HUBBUB
THE MASS BESIDE THE ATOM THE STRIP OF
RUINED WALL AND THE BROKEN BOWL THREATENING FRATERNIZATION OF
EVERY SORT OF RUBBISH
SISYPHUS HAD THROWN HIS ROCK THERE AND JOB HIS
POTSHERD
TERRIBLE IN SHORT
IT WAS THE ACROPOLIS OF THE BAREFOOTED
OVERTURNED CARTS BROKE THE UNIFORMITY OF THE SLOPE AN IMMENSE DRAY WAS
SPREAD OUT THERE CROSSWAYS ITS AXLE POINTING HEAVENWARD AND SEEMED A
SCAR ON THAT TUMULTUOUS FACADE AN OMNIBUS HOISTED GAYLY BY MAIN FORCE
TO THE VERY SUMMIT OF THE HEAP AS THOUGH THE ARCHITECTS OF THIS BIT OF
SAVAGERY HAD WISHED TO ADD A TOUCH OF THE STREET URCHIN HUMOR TO THEIR
TERROR PRESENTED ITS HORSELESS UNHARNESSED POLE TO NO ONE KNOWS WHAT
HORSES OF THE AIR
THIS GIGANTIC HEAP THE ALLUVIUM OF THE REVOLT
FIGURED TO THE MIND AN OSSA ON PELION OF ALL REVOLUTIONS '93 ON '89
THE 9TH OF THERMIDOR ON THE 10TH OF AUGUST THE 18TH OF BRUMAIRE ON THE
11TH OF JANUARY VENDEMIAIRE ON PRAIRIAL 1848 ON 1830
THE SITUATION
DESERVED THE TROUBLE AND THIS BARRICADE WAS WORTHY TO FIGURE ON THE VERY
SPOT WHENCE THE BASTILLE HAD DISAPPEARED
IF THE OCEAN MADE DIKES IT
IS THUS THAT IT WOULD BUILD
THE FURY OF THE FLOOD WAS STAMPED UPON THIS
SHAPELESS MASS
WHAT FLOOD THE CROWD
ONE THOUGHT ONE BEHELD HUBBUB
PETRIFIED
ONE THOUGHT ONE HEARD HUMMING ABOVE THIS BARRICADE AS THOUGH
THERE HAD BEEN OVER THEIR HIVE ENORMOUS DARK BEES OF VIOLENT PROGRESS
WAS IT A THICKET WAS IT A BACCHANALIA WAS IT A FORTRESS VERTIGO
SEEMED TO HAVE CONSTRUCTED IT WITH BLOWS OF ITS WINGS
THERE WAS
SOMETHING OF THE CESS POOL IN THAT REDOUBT AND SOMETHING OLYMPIAN IN
THAT CONFUSION
ONE THERE BEHELD IN A PELL MELL FULL OF DESPAIR THE
RAFTERS OF ROOFS BITS OF GARRET WINDOWS WITH THEIR FIGURED PAPER
WINDOW SASHES WITH THEIR GLASS PLANTED THERE IN THE RUINS AWAITING
THE CANNON WRECKS OF CHIMNEYS CUPBOARDS TABLES BENCHES HOWLING
TOPSYTURVEYDOM AND THOSE THOUSAND POVERTY STRICKEN THINGS THE VERY
REFUSE OF THE MENDICANT WHICH CONTAIN AT THE SAME TIME FURY AND
NOTHINGNESS
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS THE TATTERS OF A PEOPLE
RAGS OF WOOD OF IRON OF BRONZE OF STONE AND THAT THE FAUBOURG SAINT
ANTOINE HAD THRUST IT THERE AT ITS DOOR WITH A COLOSSAL FLOURISH OF THE
BROOM MAKING OF ITS MISERY ITS BARRICADE
BLOCKS RESEMBLING HEADSMAN'S
BLOCKS DISLOCATED CHAINS PIECES OF WOODWORK WITH BRACKETS HAVING
THE FORM OF GIBBETS HORIZONTAL WHEELS PROJECTING FROM THE RUBBISH
AMALGAMATED WITH THIS EDIFICE OF ANARCHY THE SOMBRE FIGURE OF THE OLD
TORTURES ENDURED BY THE PEOPLE
THE BARRICADE SAINT ANTOINE CONVERTED
EVERYTHING INTO A WEAPON EVERYTHING THAT CIVIL WAR COULD THROW AT THE
HEAD OF SOCIETY PROCEEDED THENCE IT WAS NOT COMBAT IT WAS A PAROXYSM
THE CARBINES WHICH DEFENDED THIS REDOUBT AMONG WHICH THERE WERE SOME
BLUNDERBUSSES SENT BITS OF EARTHENWARE BONES COAT BUTTONS EVEN THE
CASTERS FROM NIGHT STANDS DANGEROUS PROJECTILES ON ACCOUNT OF
THE BRASS
THIS BARRICADE WAS FURIOUS IT HURLED TO THE CLOUDS AN
INEXPRESSIBLE CLAMOR AT CERTAIN MOMENTS WHEN PROVOKING THE ARMY IT
WAS COVERED WITH THRONGS AND TEMPEST A TUMULTUOUS CROWD OF FLAMING
HEADS CROWNED IT A SWARM FILLED IT IT HAD A THORNY CREST OF GUNS OF
SABRES OF CUDGELS OF AXES OF PIKES AND OF BAYONETS A VAST RED FLAG
FLAPPED IN THE WIND SHOUTS OF COMMAND SONGS OF ATTACK THE ROLL OF
DRUMS THE SOBS OF WOMEN AND BURSTS OF GLOOMY LAUGHTER FROM THE STARVING
WERE TO BE HEARD THERE
IT WAS HUGE AND LIVING AND LIKE THE BACK OF AN
ELECTRIC BEAST THERE PROCEEDED FROM IT LITTLE FLASHES OF LIGHTNING
THE
SPIRIT OF REVOLUTION COVERED WITH ITS CLOUD THIS SUMMIT WHERE RUMBLED
THAT VOICE OF THE PEOPLE WHICH RESEMBLES THE VOICE OF GOD A STRANGE
MAJESTY WAS EMITTED BY THIS TITANIC BASKET OF RUBBISH
IT WAS A HEAP OF
FILTH AND IT WAS SINAI
AS WE HAVE SAID PREVIOUSLY IT ATTACKED IN THE NAME OF THE
REVOLUTION WHAT THE REVOLUTION
IT THAT BARRICADE CHANCE HAZARD
DISORDER TERROR MISUNDERSTANDING THE UNKNOWN HAD FACING IT THE
CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE
THE NATION THE REPUBLIC AND IT WAS THE CARMAGNOLE BIDDING DEFIANCE TO
THE MARSEILLAISE
IMMENSE BUT HEROIC DEFIANCE FOR THE OLD FAUBOURG IS A HERO
THE FAUBOURG AND ITS REDOUBT LENT EACH OTHER ASSISTANCE
THE FAUBOURG
SHOULDERED THE REDOUBT THE REDOUBT TOOK ITS STAND UNDER COVER OF THE
FAUBOURG
THE VAST BARRICADE SPREAD OUT LIKE A CLIFF AGAINST WHICH
THE STRATEGY OF THE AFRICAN GENERALS DASHED ITSELF
ITS CAVERNS ITS
EXCRESCENCES ITS WARTS ITS GIBBOSITIES GRIMACED SO TO SPEAK AND
GRINNED BENEATH THE SMOKE
THE MITRAILLE VANISHED IN SHAPELESSNESS THE
BOMBS PLUNGED INTO IT BULLETS ONLY SUCCEEDED IN MAKING HOLES IN IT
WHAT WAS THE USE OF CANNONADING CHAOS AND THE REGIMENTS ACCUSTOMED TO
THE FIERCEST VISIONS OF WAR GAZED WITH UNEASY EYES ON THAT SPECIES OF
REDOUBT A WILD BEAST IN ITS BOAR LIKE BRISTLING AND A MOUNTAIN BY ITS
ENORMOUS SIZE
A QUARTER OF A LEAGUE AWAY FROM THE CORNER OF THE RUE DU TEMPLE WHICH
DEBOUCHES ON THE BOULEVARD NEAR THE CHATEAUD'EAU IF ONE THRUST ONE'S
HEAD BODILY BEYOND THE POINT FORMED BY THE FRONT OF THE DALLEMAGNE SHOP
ONE PERCEIVED IN THE DISTANCE BEYOND THE CANAL IN THE STREET WHICH
MOUNTS THE SLOPES OF BELLEVILLE AT THE CULMINATING POINT OF THE RISE A
STRANGE WALL REACHING TO THE SECOND STORY OF THE HOUSE FRONTS A SORT
OF HYPHEN BETWEEN THE HOUSES ON THE RIGHT AND THE HOUSES ON THE LEFT AS
THOUGH THE STREET HAD FOLDED BACK ON ITSELF ITS LOFTIEST WALL IN ORDER
TO CLOSE ITSELF ABRUPTLY
THIS WALL WAS BUILT OF PAVING STONES
IT WAS
STRAIGHT CORRECT COLD PERPENDICULAR LEVELLED WITH THE SQUARE LAID
OUT BY RULE AND LINE
CEMENT WAS LACKING OF COURSE BUT AS IN THE CASE
OF CERTAIN ROMAN WALLS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH ITS RIGID ARCHITECTURE
THE ENTABLATURE WAS MATHEMATICALLY PARALLEL WITH THE BASE
FROM DISTANCE
TO DISTANCE ONE COULD DISTINGUISH ON THE GRAY SURFACE ALMOST INVISIBLE
LOOPHOLES WHICH RESEMBLED BLACK THREADS
THESE LOOPHOLES WERE SEPARATED
FROM EACH OTHER BY EQUAL SPACES
THE STREET WAS DESERTED AS FAR AS THE
EYE COULD REACH
ALL WINDOWS AND DOORS WERE CLOSED
IN THE BACKGROUND
ROSE THIS BARRIER WHICH MADE A BLIND THOROUGHFARE OF THE STREET A
MOTIONLESS AND TRANQUIL WALL NO ONE WAS VISIBLE NOTHING WAS AUDIBLE
NOT A CRY NOT A SOUND NOT A BREATH
A SEPULCHRE
THE DAZZLING SUN OF JUNE INUNDATED THIS TERRIBLE THING WITH LIGHT
IT WAS THE BARRICADE OF THE FAUBOURG OF THE TEMPLE
AS SOON AS ONE ARRIVED ON THE SPOT AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF IT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE EVEN FOR THE BOLDEST NOT TO BECOME THOUGHTFUL BEFORE
THIS MYSTERIOUS APPARITION
IT WAS ADJUSTED JOINTED IMBRICATED
RECTILINEAR SYMMETRICAL AND FUNEREAL
SCIENCE AND GLOOM MET THERE
ONE
FELT THAT THE CHIEF OF THIS BARRICADE WAS A GEOMETRICIAN OR A SPECTRE
ONE LOOKED AT IT AND SPOKE LOW
FROM TIME TO TIME IF SOME SOLDIER AN OFFICER OR REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
PEOPLE CHANCED TO TRAVERSE THE DESERTED HIGHWAY A FAINT SHARP WHISTLE
WAS HEARD AND THE PASSER BY FELL DEAD OR WOUNDED OR IF HE ESCAPED THE
BULLET SOMETIMES A BISCAIEN WAS SEEN TO ENSCONCE ITSELF IN SOME CLOSED
SHUTTER IN THE INTERSTICE BETWEEN TWO BLOCKS OF STONE OR IN THE
PLASTER OF A WALL
FOR THE MEN IN THE BARRICADE HAD MADE THEMSELVES TWO
SMALL CANNONS OUT OF TWO CAST IRON LENGTHS OF GAS PIPE PLUGGED UP AT
ONE END WITH TOW AND FIRE CLAY
THERE WAS NO WASTE OF USELESS POWDER
NEARLY EVERY SHOT TOLD
THERE WERE CORPSES HERE AND THERE AND POOLS OF
BLOOD ON THE PAVEMENT
I REMEMBER A WHITE BUTTERFLY WHICH WENT AND CAME
IN THE STREET
SUMMER DOES NOT ABDICATE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE SPACES BENEATH THE PORTES COCHERES WERE
ENCUMBERED WITH WOUNDED
ONE FELT ONESELF AIMED AT BY SOME PERSON WHOM ONE DID NOT SEE AND ONE
UNDERSTOOD THAT GUNS WERE LEVELLED AT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STREET
MASSED BEHIND THE SORT OF SLOPING RIDGE WHICH THE VAULTED CANAL FORMS
AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE FAUBOURG DU TEMPLE THE SOLDIERS OF THE ATTACKING
COLUMN GRAVELY AND THOUGHTFULLY WATCHED THIS DISMAL REDOUBT THIS
IMMOBILITY THIS PASSIVITY WHENCE SPRANG DEATH
SOME CRAWLED FLAT ON
THEIR FACES AS FAR AS THE CREST OF THE CURVE OF THE BRIDGE TAKING CARE
THAT THEIR SHAKOS DID NOT PROJECT BEYOND IT
THE VALIANT COLONEL MONTEYNARD ADMIRED THIS BARRICADE WITH A
SHUDDER HOW THAT IS BUILT HE SAID TO A REPRESENTATIVE
NOT ONE
PAVING STONE PROJECTS BEYOND ITS NEIGHBOR
IT IS MADE OF PORCELAIN AT
THAT MOMENT A BULLET BROKE THE CROSS ON HIS BREAST AND HE FELL
THE COWARDS PEOPLE SAID
LET THEM SHOW THEMSELVES
LET US SEE THEM
THEY DARE NOT THEY ARE HIDING
THE BARRICADE OF THE FAUBOURG DU TEMPLE DEFENDED BY EIGHTY MEN
ATTACKED BY TEN THOUSAND HELD OUT FOR THREE DAYS
ON THE FOURTH THEY
DID AS AT ZAATCHA AS AT CONSTANTINE THEY PIERCED THE HOUSES THEY CAME
OVER THE ROOFS THE BARRICADE WAS TAKEN
NOT ONE OF THE EIGHTY COWARDS
THOUGHT OF FLIGHT ALL WERE KILLED THERE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE
LEADER BARTHELEMY OF WHOM WE SHALL SPEAK PRESENTLY
THE SAINT ANTOINE BARRICADE WAS THE TUMULT OF THUNDERS THE BARRICADE
OF THE TEMPLE WAS SILENCE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO REDOUBTS
WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FORMIDABLE AND THE SINISTER
ONE SEEMED A
MAW THE OTHER A MASK
ADMITTING THAT THE GIGANTIC AND GLOOMY INSURRECTION OF JUNE WAS COMPOSED
OF A WRATH AND OF AN ENIGMA ONE DIVINED IN THE FIRST BARRICADE THE
DRAGON AND BEHIND THE SECOND THE SPHINX
THESE TWO FORTRESSES HAD BEEN ERECTED BY TWO MEN NAMED THE ONE
COURNET THE OTHER BARTHELEMY
COURNET MADE THE SAINT ANTOINE
BARRICADE BARTHELEMY THE BARRICADE OF THE TEMPLE
EACH WAS THE IMAGE OF
THE MAN WHO HAD BUILT IT
COURNET WAS A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE HE HAD BROAD SHOULDERS A RED FACE
A CRUSHING FIST A BOLD HEART A LOYAL SOUL A SINCERE AND TERRIBLE EYE
INTREPID ENERGETIC IRASCIBLE STORMY THE MOST CORDIAL OF MEN THE
MOST FORMIDABLE OF COMBATANTS
WAR STRIFE CONFLICT WERE THE VERY AIR
HE BREATHED AND PUT HIM IN A GOOD HUMOR
HE HAD BEEN AN OFFICER IN THE
NAVY AND FROM HIS GESTURES AND HIS VOICE ONE DIVINED THAT HE SPRANG
FROM THE OCEAN AND THAT HE CAME FROM THE TEMPEST HE CARRIED THE
HURRICANE ON INTO BATTLE
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE GENIUS THERE WAS
IN COURNET SOMETHING OF DANTON AS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DIVINITY
THERE WAS IN DANTON SOMETHING OF HERCULES
BARTHELEMY THIN FEEBLE PALE TACITURN WAS A SORT OF TRAGIC STREET
URCHIN WHO HAVING HAD HIS EARS BOXED BY A POLICEMAN LAY IN WAIT FOR
HIM AND KILLED HIM AND AT SEVENTEEN WAS SENT TO THE GALLEYS
HE CAME
OUT AND MADE THIS BARRICADE
LATER ON FATAL CIRCUMSTANCE IN LONDON PROSCRIBED BY ALL BARTHELEMY
SLEW COURNET
IT WAS A FUNEREAL DUEL
SOME TIME AFTERWARDS CAUGHT IN
THE GEARING OF ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS ADVENTURES IN WHICH PASSION
PLAYS A PART A CATASTROPHE IN WHICH FRENCH JUSTICE SEES EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN WHICH ENGLISH JUSTICE SEES ONLY DEATH BARTHELEMY
WAS HANGED
THE SOMBRE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION IS SO MADE THAT THANKS TO
MATERIAL DESTITUTION THANKS TO MORAL OBSCURITY THAT UNHAPPY BEING
WHO POSSESSED AN INTELLIGENCE CERTAINLY FIRM POSSIBLY GREAT BEGAN
IN FRANCE WITH THE GALLEYS AND ENDED IN ENGLAND WITH THE GALLOWS
BARTHELEMY ON OCCASION FLEW BUT ONE FLAG THE BLACK FLAG
CHAPTER II WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE ABYSS IF ONE DOES NOT CONVERSE
SIXTEEN YEARS COUNT IN THE SUBTERRANEAN EDUCATION OF INSURRECTION AND
JUNE 1848 KNEW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT IT THAN JUNE 1832
SO THE
BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE WAS ONLY AN OUTLINE AND AN EMBRYO
COMPARED TO THE TWO COLOSSAL BARRICADES WHICH WE HAVE JUST SKETCHED BUT
IT WAS FORMIDABLE FOR THAT EPOCH
THE INSURGENTS UNDER THE EYE OF ENJOLRAS FOR MARIUS NO LONGER LOOKED
AFTER ANYTHING HAD MADE GOOD USE OF THE NIGHT
THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN
NOT ONLY REPAIRED BUT AUGMENTED
THEY HAD RAISED IT TWO FEET
BARS
OF IRON PLANTED IN THE PAVEMENT RESEMBLED LANCES IN REST
ALL SORTS OF
RUBBISH BROUGHT AND ADDED FROM ALL DIRECTIONS COMPLICATED THE EXTERNAL
CONFUSION
THE REDOUBT HAD BEEN CLEVERLY MADE OVER INTO A WALL ON THE
INSIDE AND A THICKET ON THE OUTSIDE
THE STAIRCASE OF PAVING STONES WHICH PERMITTED ONE TO MOUNT IT LIKE THE
WALL OF A CITADEL HAD BEEN RECONSTRUCTED
THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN PUT IN ORDER THE TAP ROOM DISENCUMBERED THE
KITCHEN APPROPRIATED FOR THE AMBULANCE THE DRESSING OF THE WOUNDED
COMPLETED THE POWDER SCATTERED ON THE GROUND AND ON THE TABLES HAD BEEN
GATHERED UP BULLETS RUN CARTRIDGES MANUFACTURED LINT SCRAPED THE
FALLEN WEAPONS RE DISTRIBUTED THE INTERIOR OF THE REDOUBT CLEANED THE
RUBBISH SWEPT UP CORPSES REMOVED
THEY LAID THE DEAD IN A HEAP IN THE MONDETOUR LANE OF WHICH THEY WERE
STILL THE MASTERS
THE PAVEMENT WAS RED FOR A LONG TIME AT THAT SPOT
AMONG THE DEAD THERE WERE FOUR NATIONAL GUARDSMEN OF THE SUBURBS
ENJOLRAS HAD THEIR UNIFORMS LAID ASIDE
ENJOLRAS HAD ADVISED TWO HOURS OF SLEEP
ADVICE FROM ENJOLRAS WAS A
COMMAND
STILL ONLY THREE OR FOUR TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT
FEUILLY EMPLOYED THESE TWO HOURS IN ENGRAVING THIS INSCRIPTION ON THE
WALL WHICH FACED THE TAVERN
LONG LIVE THE PEOPLES
THESE FOUR WORDS HOLLOWED OUT IN THE ROUGH STONE WITH A NAIL COULD BE
STILL READ ON THE WALL IN 1848
THE THREE WOMEN HAD PROFITED BY THE RESPITE OF THE NIGHT TO VANISH
DEFINITELY WHICH ALLOWED THE INSURGENTS TO BREATHE MORE FREELY
THEY HAD FOUND MEANS OF TAKING REFUGE IN SOME NEIGHBORING HOUSE
THE GREATER PART OF THE WOUNDED WERE ABLE AND WISHED TO FIGHT STILL
ON A LITTER OF MATTRESSES AND TRUSSES OF STRAW IN THE KITCHEN WHICH HAD
BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN AMBULANCE THERE WERE FIVE MEN GRAVELY WOUNDED
TWO OF WHOM WERE MUNICIPAL GUARDSMEN
THE MUNICIPAL GUARDSMEN WERE
ATTENDED TO FIRST
IN THE TAP ROOM THERE REMAINED ONLY MABEUF UNDER HIS BLACK CLOTH AND
JAVERT BOUND TO HIS POST
THIS IS THE HALL OF THE DEAD SAID ENJOLRAS
IN THE INTERIOR OF THIS HALL BARELY LIGHTED BY A CANDLE AT ONE END THE
MORTUARY TABLE BEING BEHIND THE POST LIKE A HORIZONTAL BAR A SORT OF
VAST VAGUE CROSS RESULTED FROM JAVERT ERECT AND MABEUF LYING PRONE
THE POLE OF THE OMNIBUS ALTHOUGH SNAPPED OFF BY THE FUSILLADE WAS
STILL SUFFICIENTLY UPRIGHT TO ADMIT OF THEIR FASTENING THE FLAG TO IT
ENJOLRAS WHO POSSESSED THAT QUALITY OF A LEADER OF ALWAYS DOING WHAT
HE SAID ATTACHED TO THIS STAFF THE BULLET RIDDEN AND BLOODY COAT OF THE
OLD MAN'S
NO REPAST HAD BEEN POSSIBLE
THERE WAS NEITHER BREAD NOR MEAT
THE FIFTY
MEN IN THE BARRICADE HAD SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED THE SCANTY PROVISIONS OF
THE WINE SHOP DURING THE SIXTEEN HOURS WHICH THEY HAD PASSED THERE
AT A
GIVEN MOMENT EVERY BARRICADE INEVITABLY BECOMES THE RAFT OF LA MEDUSE
THEY WERE OBLIGED TO RESIGN THEMSELVES TO HUNGER
THEY HAD THEN REACHED
THE FIRST HOURS OF THAT SPARTAN DAY OF THE 6TH OF JUNE WHEN IN THE
BARRICADE SAINT MERRY JEANNE SURROUNDED BY THE INSURGENTS WHO DEMANDED
BREAD REPLIED TO ALL COMBATANTS CRYING SOMETHING TO EAT WITH WHY
IT IS THREE O'CLOCK AT FOUR WE SHALL BE DEAD
AS THEY COULD NO LONGER EAT ENJOLRAS FORBADE THEM TO DRINK
HE
INTERDICTED WINE AND PORTIONED OUT THE BRANDY
THEY HAD FOUND IN THE CELLAR FIFTEEN FULL BOTTLES HERMETICALLY SEALED
ENJOLRAS AND COMBEFERRE EXAMINED THEM
COMBEFERRE WHEN HE CAME UP AGAIN
SAID IT'S THE OLD STOCK OF FATHER HUCHELOUP WHO BEGAN BUSINESS AS
A GROCER IT MUST BE REAL WINE OBSERVED BOSSUET
IT'S LUCKY THAT
GRANTAIRE IS ASLEEP
IF HE WERE ON FOOT THERE WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL OF
DIFFICULTY IN SAVING THOSE BOTTLES ENJOLRAS IN SPITE OF ALL MURMURS
PLACED HIS VETO ON THE FIFTEEN BOTTLES AND IN ORDER THAT NO ONE MIGHT
TOUCH THEM HE HAD THEM PLACED UNDER THE TABLE ON WHICH FATHER MABEUF
WAS LYING
ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THEY RECKONED UP THEIR STRENGTH
THERE
WERE STILL THIRTY SEVEN OF THEM
THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN
THE TORCH WHICH HAD BEEN REPLACED IN ITS
CAVITY IN THE PAVEMENT HAD JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED
THE INTERIOR OF THE
BARRICADE THAT SPECIES OF TINY COURTYARD APPROPRIATED FROM THE STREET
WAS BATHED IN SHADOWS AND RESEMBLED ATHWART THE VAGUE TWILIGHT
HORROR THE DECK OF A DISABLED SHIP
THE COMBATANTS AS THEY WENT
AND CAME MOVED ABOUT THERE LIKE BLACK FORMS
ABOVE THAT TERRIBLE
NESTING PLACE OF GLOOM THE STORIES OF THE MUTE HOUSES WERE LIVIDLY
OUTLINED AT THE VERY TOP THE CHIMNEYS STOOD PALELY OUT
THE SKY WAS OF
THAT CHARMING UNDECIDED HUE WHICH MAY BE WHITE AND MAY BE BLUE
BIRDS
FLEW ABOUT IN IT WITH CRIES OF JOY
THE LOFTY HOUSE WHICH FORMED THE
BACK OF THE BARRICADE BEING TURNED TO THE EAST HAD UPON ITS ROOF A
ROSY REFLECTION
THE MORNING BREEZE RUFFLED THE GRAY HAIR ON THE HEAD OF
THE DEAD MAN AT THE THIRD STORY WINDOW
I AM DELIGHTED THAT THE TORCH HAS BEEN EXTINGUISHED SAID COURFEYRAC
TO FEUILLY
THAT TORCH FLICKERING IN THE WIND ANNOYED ME
IT HAD THE
APPEARANCE OF BEING AFRAID
THE LIGHT OF TORCHES RESEMBLES THE WISDOM OF
COWARDS IT GIVES A BAD LIGHT BECAUSE IT TREMBLES
DAWN AWAKENS MINDS AS IT DOES THE BIRDS ALL BEGAN TO TALK
JOLY PERCEIVING A CAT PROWLING ON A GUTTER EXTRACTED PHILOSOPHY FROM
IT
WHAT IS THE CAT HE EXCLAIMED
IT IS A CORRECTIVE
THE GOOD GOD
HAVING MADE THE MOUSE SAID 'HULLO I HAVE COMMITTED A BLUNDER AND
SO HE MADE THE CAT
THE CAT IS THE ERRATUM OF THE MOUSE
THE MOUSE PLUS
THE CAT IS THE PROOF OF CREATION REVISED AND CORRECTED
COMBEFERRE SURROUNDED BY STUDENTS AND ARTISANS WAS SPEAKING OF THE
DEAD OF JEAN PROUVAIRE OF BAHOREL OF MABEUF AND EVEN OF CABUC AND
OF ENJOLRAS' SAD SEVERITY
HE SAID
HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON BRUTUS CHEREAS STEPHANUS CROMWELL
CHARLOTTE CORDAY SAND HAVE ALL HAD THEIR MOMENT OF AGONY WHEN IT WAS
TOO LATE
OUR HEARTS QUIVER SO AND HUMAN LIFE IS SUCH A MYSTERY THAT
EVEN IN THE CASE OF A CIVIC MURDER EVEN IN A MURDER FOR LIBERATION IF
THERE BE SUCH A THING THE REMORSE FOR HAVING STRUCK A MAN SURPASSES THE
JOY OF HAVING SERVED THE HUMAN RACE
AND SUCH ARE THE WINDINGS OF THE EXCHANGE OF SPEECH THAT A MOMENT
LATER BY A TRANSITION BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH JEAN PROUVAIRE'S VERSES
COMBEFERRE WAS COMPARING THE TRANSLATORS OF THE GEORGICS RAUX WITH
COURNAND COURNAND WITH DELILLE POINTING OUT THE PASSAGES TRANSLATED
BY MALFILATRE PARTICULARLY THE PRODIGIES OF CAESAR'S DEATH AND AT THAT
WORD CAESAR THE CONVERSATION REVERTED TO BRUTUS
CAESAR SAID COMBEFERRE FELL JUSTLY
CICERO WAS SEVERE TOWARDS
CAESAR AND HE WAS RIGHT
THAT SEVERITY IS NOT DIATRIBE
WHEN ZOILUS
INSULTS HOMER WHEN MAEVIUS INSULTS VIRGIL WHEN VISE INSULTS MOLIERE
WHEN POPE INSULTS SHAKSPEARE WHEN FREDERIC INSULTS VOLTAIRE IT IS AN
OLD LAW OF ENVY AND HATRED WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT GENIUS ATTRACTS
INSULT GREAT MEN ARE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS BARKED AT
BUT ZOILUS AND
CICERO ARE TWO DIFFERENT PERSONS
CICERO IS AN ARBITER IN THOUGHT JUST
AS BRUTUS IS AN ARBITER BY THE SWORD
FOR MY OWN PART I BLAME THAT LAST
JUSTICE THE BLADE BUT ANTIQUITY ADMITTED IT
CAESAR THE VIOLATOR
OF THE RUBICON CONFERRING AS THOUGH THEY CAME FROM HIM THE DIGNITIES
WHICH EMANATED FROM THE PEOPLE NOT RISING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE
SENATE COMMITTED THE ACTS OF A KING AND ALMOST OF A TYRANT REGIA AC
PENE TYRANNICA
HE WAS A GREAT MAN SO MUCH THE WORSE OR SO MUCH THE
BETTER THE LESSON IS BUT THE MORE EXALTED
HIS TWENTY THREE WOUNDS
TOUCH ME LESS THAN THE SPITTING IN THE FACE OF JESUS CHRIST
CAESAR IS
STABBED BY THE SENATORS CHRIST IS CUFFED BY LACKEYS
ONE FEELS THE GOD
THROUGH THE GREATER OUTRAGE
BOSSUET WHO TOWERED ABOVE THE INTERLOCUTORS FROM THE SUMMIT OF A HEAP
OF PAVING STONES EXCLAIMED RIFLE IN HAND
OH CYDATHENAEUM OH MYRRHINUS OH PROBALINTHUS OH GRACES OF THE
AEANTIDES OH WHO WILL GRANT ME TO PRONOUNCE THE VERSES OF HOMER LIKE A
GREEK OF LAURIUM OR OF EDAPTEON
CHAPTER III LIGHT AND SHADOW
ENJOLRAS HAD BEEN TO MAKE A RECONNAISSANCE
HE HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT
THROUGH MONDETOUR LANE GLIDING ALONG CLOSE TO THE HOUSES
THE INSURGENTS WE WILL REMARK WERE FULL OF HOPE
THE MANNER IN WHICH
THEY HAD REPULSED THE ATTACK OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT HAD CAUSED THEM TO
ALMOST DISDAIN IN ADVANCE THE ATTACK AT DAWN
THEY WAITED FOR IT WITH
A SMILE
THEY HAD NO MORE DOUBT AS TO THEIR SUCCESS THAN AS TO THEIR
CAUSE
MOREOVER SUCCOR WAS EVIDENTLY ON THE WAY TO THEM
THEY
RECKONED ON IT
WITH THAT FACILITY OF TRIUMPHANT PROPHECY WHICH IS ONE
OF THE SOURCES OF STRENGTH IN THE FRENCH COMBATANT THEY DIVIDED THE
DAY WHICH WAS AT HAND INTO THREE DISTINCT PHASES
AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE
MORNING A REGIMENT WHICH HAD BEEN LABORED WITH WOULD TURN AT NOON
THE INSURRECTION OF ALL PARIS AT SUNSET REVOLUTION
THEY HEARD THE ALARM BELL OF SAINT MERRY WHICH HAD NOT BEEN SILENT FOR
AN INSTANT SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE A PROOF THAT THE OTHER BARRICADE THE
GREAT ONE JEANNE'S STILL HELD OUT
ALL THESE HOPES WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT GROUPS IN A SORT OF
GAY AND FORMIDABLE WHISPER WHICH RESEMBLED THE WARLIKE HUM OF A HIVE OF
BEES
ENJOLRAS REAPPEARED
HE RETURNED FROM HIS SOMBRE EAGLE FLIGHT INTO OUTER
DARKNESS
HE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT TO ALL THIS JOY WITH FOLDED ARMS AND
ONE HAND ON HIS MOUTH
THEN FRESH AND ROSY IN THE GROWING WHITENESS OF
THE DAWN HE SAID
THE WHOLE ARMY OF PARIS IS TO STRIKE
A THIRD OF THE ARMY IS BEARING
DOWN UPON THE BARRICADES IN WHICH YOU NOW ARE
THERE IS THE NATIONAL
GUARD IN ADDITION
I HAVE PICKED OUT THE SHAKOS OF THE FIFTH OF THE
LINE AND THE STANDARD BEARERS OF THE SIXTH LEGION
IN ONE HOUR YOU WILL
BE ATTACKED
AS FOR THE POPULACE IT WAS SEETHING YESTERDAY TO DAY
IT IS NOT STIRRING
THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPECT NOTHING TO HOPE FOR
NEITHER FROM A FAUBOURG NOR FROM A REGIMENT
YOU ARE ABANDONED
THESE WORDS FELL UPON THE BUZZING OF THE GROUPS AND PRODUCED ON THEM
THE EFFECT CAUSED ON A SWARM OF BEES BY THE FIRST DROPS OF A STORM
A
MOMENT OF INDESCRIBABLE SILENCE ENSUED IN WHICH DEATH MIGHT HAVE BEEN
HEARD FLITTING BY
THIS MOMENT WAS BRIEF
A VOICE FROM THE OBSCUREST DEPTHS OF THE GROUPS SHOUTED TO ENJOLRAS
SO BE IT
LET US RAISE THE BARRICADE TO A HEIGHT OF TWENTY FEET AND
LET US ALL REMAIN IN IT
CITIZENS LET US OFFER THE PROTESTS OF CORPSES
LET US SHOW THAT IF THE PEOPLE ABANDON THE REPUBLICANS THE REPUBLICANS
DO NOT ABANDON THE PEOPLE
THESE WORDS FREED THE THOUGHT OF ALL FROM THE PAINFUL CLOUD OF
INDIVIDUAL ANXIETIES
IT WAS HAILED WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC ACCLAMATION
NO ONE EVER HAS KNOWN THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO SPOKE THUS HE WAS SOME
UNKNOWN BLOUSE WEARER A STRANGER A MAN FORGOTTEN A PASSING HERO THAT
GREAT ANONYMOUS ALWAYS MINGLED IN HUMAN CRISES AND IN SOCIAL GENESES
WHO AT A GIVEN MOMENT UTTERS IN A SUPREME FASHION THE DECISIVE WORD
AND WHO VANISHES INTO THE SHADOWS AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED FOR A MINUTE
IN A LIGHTNING FLASH THE PEOPLE AND GOD
THIS INEXORABLE RESOLUTION SO THOROUGHLY IMPREGNATED THE AIR OF THE
6TH OF JUNE 1832 THAT ALMOST AT THE VERY SAME HOUR ON THE BARRICADE
SAINT MERRY THE INSURGENTS WERE RAISING THAT CLAMOR WHICH HAS BECOME A
MATTER OF HISTORY AND WHICH HAS BEEN CONSIGNED TO THE DOCUMENTS IN THE
CASE WHAT MATTERS IT WHETHER THEY COME TO OUR ASSISTANCE OR NOT LET
US GET OURSELVES KILLED HERE TO THE VERY LAST MAN
AS THE READER SEES THE TWO BARRICADES THOUGH MATERIALLY ISOLATED WERE
IN COMMUNICATION WITH EACH OTHER
CHAPTER IV MINUS FIVE PLUS ONE
AFTER THE MAN WHO DECREED THE PROTEST OF CORPSES HAD SPOKEN AND HAD
GIVEN THIS FORMULA OF THEIR COMMON SOUL THERE ISSUED FROM ALL MOUTHS A
STRANGELY SATISFIED AND TERRIBLE CRY FUNEREAL IN SENSE AND TRIUMPHANT
IN TONE
LONG LIVE DEATH LET US ALL REMAIN HERE
WHY ALL SAID ENJOLRAS
ALL ALL
ENJOLRAS RESUMED
THE POSITION IS GOOD THE BARRICADE IS FINE
THIRTY MEN ARE ENOUGH
WHY
SACRIFICE FORTY
THEY REPLIED
BECAUSE NOT ONE WILL GO AWAY
CITIZENS CRIED ENJOLRAS AND THERE WAS AN ALMOST IRRITATED VIBRATION
IN HIS VOICE THIS REPUBLIC IS NOT RICH ENOUGH IN MEN TO INDULGE IN
USELESS EXPENDITURE OF THEM
VAIN GLORY IS WASTE
IF THE DUTY OF SOME IS
TO DEPART THAT DUTY SHOULD BE FULFILLED LIKE ANY OTHER
ENJOLRAS THE MAN PRINCIPLE HAD OVER HIS CO RELIGIONISTS THAT SORT OF
OMNIPOTENT POWER WHICH EMANATES FROM THE ABSOLUTE
STILL GREAT AS WAS
THIS OMNIPOTENCE A MURMUR AROSE
A LEADER TO THE VERY FINGER TIPS
ENJOLRAS SEEING THAT THEY MURMURED INSISTED
HE RESUMED HAUGHTILY
LET THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF NOT NUMBERING MORE THAN THIRTY SAY SO
THE MURMURS REDOUBLED
BESIDES OBSERVED A VOICE IN ONE GROUP IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO TALK
ABOUT LEAVING
THE BARRICADE IS HEMMED IN
NOT ON THE SIDE OF THE HALLES SAID ENJOLRAS
THE RUE MONDETOUR IS
FREE AND THROUGH THE RUE DES PRECHEURS ONE CAN REACH THE MARCHE DES
INNOCENTS
AND THERE WENT ON ANOTHER VOICE YOU WOULD BE CAPTURED
YOU WOULD
FALL IN WITH SOME GRAND GUARD OF THE LINE OR THE SUBURBS THEY WILL SPY
A MAN PASSING IN BLOUSE AND CAP
'WHENCE COME YOU 'DON'T YOU BELONG TO
THE BARRICADE AND THEY WILL LOOK AT YOUR HANDS
YOU SMELL OF POWDER
SHOT
ENJOLRAS WITHOUT MAKING ANY REPLY TOUCHED COMBEFERRE'S SHOULDER AND
THE TWO ENTERED THE TAP ROOM
THEY EMERGED THENCE A MOMENT LATER
ENJOLRAS HELD IN HIS OUTSTRETCHED
HANDS THE FOUR UNIFORMS WHICH HE HAD LAID ASIDE
COMBEFERRE FOLLOWED
CARRYING THE SHOULDER BELTS AND THE SHAKOS
WITH THIS UNIFORM SAID ENJOLRAS YOU CAN MINGLE WITH THE RANKS AND
ESCAPE HERE IS ENOUGH FOR FOUR AND HE FLUNG ON THE GROUND DEPRIVED
OF ITS PAVEMENT THE FOUR UNIFORMS
NO WAVERING TOOK PLACE IN HIS STOICAL AUDIENCE
COMBEFERRE TOOK THE
WORD
COME SAID HE YOU MUST HAVE A LITTLE PITY
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE
QUESTION IS HERE IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN
SEE HERE
ARE THERE
WOMEN OR ARE THERE NOT ARE THERE CHILDREN OR ARE THERE NOT ARE THERE
MOTHERS YES OR NO WHO ROCK CRADLES WITH THEIR FOOT AND WHO HAVE A LOT
OF LITTLE ONES AROUND THEM LET THAT MAN OF YOU WHO HAS NEVER BEHELD A
NURSE'S BREAST RAISE HIS HAND
AH YOU WANT TO GET YOURSELVES KILLED SO
DO I I WHO AM SPEAKING TO YOU BUT I DO NOT WANT TO FEEL THE PHANTOMS
OF WOMEN WREATHING THEIR ARMS AROUND ME
DIE IF YOU WILL BUT
DON'T MAKE OTHERS DIE
SUICIDES LIKE THAT WHICH IS ON THE BRINK OF
ACCOMPLISHMENT HERE ARE SUBLIME BUT SUICIDE IS NARROW AND DOES NOT
ADMIT OF EXTENSION AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR NEIGHBORS SUICIDE
IS MURDER
THINK OF THE LITTLE BLOND HEADS THINK OF THE WHITE LOCKS
LISTEN ENJOLRAS HAS JUST TOLD ME THAT HE SAW AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE
DU CYGNE A LIGHTED CASEMENT A CANDLE IN A POOR WINDOW ON THE FIFTH
FLOOR AND ON THE PANE THE QUIVERING SHADOW OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD WOMAN
WHO HAD THE AIR OF HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN WATCHING
PERHAPS SHE IS
THE MOTHER OF SOME ONE OF YOU
WELL LET THAT MAN GO AND MAKE HASTE TO
SAY TO HIS MOTHER 'HERE I AM MOTHER LET HIM FEEL AT EASE THE TASK
HERE WILL BE PERFORMED ALL THE SAME
WHEN ONE SUPPORTS ONE'S RELATIVES
BY ONE'S TOIL ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO SACRIFICE ONE'S SELF
THAT
IS DESERTING ONE'S FAMILY
AND THOSE WHO HAVE DAUGHTERS WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING OF YOU GET YOURSELVES KILLED YOU ARE DEAD THAT IS WELL
AND
TOMORROW YOUNG GIRLS WITHOUT BREAD THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING
MAN BEGS
WOMAN SELLS
AH THOSE CHARMING AND GRACIOUS BEINGS SO GRACIOUS AND SO
SWEET WHO HAVE BONNETS OF FLOWERS WHO FILL THE HOUSE WITH PURITY WHO
SING AND PRATTLE WHO ARE LIKE A LIVING PERFUME WHO PROVE THE EXISTENCE
OF ANGELS IN HEAVEN BY THE PURITY OF VIRGINS ON EARTH THAT JEANNE
THAT LISE THAT MIMI THOSE ADORABLE AND HONEST CREATURES WHO ARE YOUR
BLESSINGS AND YOUR PRIDE AH GOOD GOD THEY WILL SUFFER HUNGER WHAT DO
YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU THERE IS A MARKET FOR HUMAN FLESH AND IT
IS NOT WITH YOUR SHADOWY HANDS SHUDDERING AROUND THEM THAT YOU
WILL PREVENT THEM FROM ENTERING IT THINK OF THE STREET THINK OF THE
PAVEMENT COVERED WITH PASSERS BY THINK OF THE SHOPS PAST WHICH WOMEN
GO AND COME WITH NECKS ALL BARE AND THROUGH THE MIRE
THESE WOMEN
TOO WERE PURE ONCE
THINK OF YOUR SISTERS THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE THEM
MISERY PROSTITUTION THE POLICE SAINT LAZARE THAT IS WHAT THOSE
BEAUTIFUL DELICATE GIRLS THOSE FRAGILE MARVELS OF MODESTY GENTLENESS
AND LOVELINESS FRESHER THAN LILACS IN THE MONTH OF MAY WILL COME TO
AH YOU HAVE GOT YOURSELVES KILLED YOU ARE NO LONGER ON HAND THAT
IS WELL YOU HAVE WISHED TO RELEASE THE PEOPLE FROM ROYALTY AND YOU
DELIVER OVER YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THE POLICE
FRIENDS HAVE A CARE HAVE
MERCY
WOMEN UNHAPPY WOMEN WE ARE NOT IN THE HABIT OF BESTOWING MUCH
THOUGHT ON THEM
WE TRUST TO THE WOMEN NOT HAVING RECEIVED A MAN'S
EDUCATION WE PREVENT THEIR READING WE PREVENT THEIR THINKING WE
PREVENT THEIR OCCUPYING THEMSELVES WITH POLITICS WILL YOU PREVENT THEM
FROM GOING TO THE DEAD HOUSE THIS EVENING AND RECOGNIZING YOUR BODIES
LET US SEE THOSE WHO HAVE FAMILIES MUST BE TRACTABLE AND SHAKE HANDS
WITH US AND TAKE THEMSELVES OFF AND LEAVE US HERE ALONE TO ATTEND TO
THIS AFFAIR
I KNOW WELL THAT COURAGE IS REQUIRED TO LEAVE THAT IT IS
HARD BUT THE HARDER IT IS THE MORE MERITORIOUS
YOU SAY 'I HAVE A
GUN I AM AT THE BARRICADE SO MUCH THE WORSE I SHALL REMAIN THERE SO
MUCH THE WORSE IS EASILY SAID
MY FRIENDS THERE IS A MORROW YOU WILL
NOT BE HERE TO MORROW BUT YOUR FAMILIES WILL AND WHAT SUFFERINGS SEE
HERE IS A PRETTY HEALTHY CHILD WITH CHEEKS LIKE AN APPLE WHO BABBLES
PRATTLES CHATTERS WHO LAUGHS WHO SMELLS SWEET BENEATH YOUR KISS AND
DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF HIM WHEN HE IS ABANDONED I HAVE SEEN ONE
A VERY SMALL CREATURE NO TALLER THAN THAT
HIS FATHER WAS DEAD
POOR
PEOPLE HAD TAKEN HIM IN OUT OF CHARITY BUT THEY HAD BREAD ONLY FOR
THEMSELVES
THE CHILD WAS ALWAYS HUNGRY
IT WAS WINTER
HE DID NOT CRY
YOU COULD SEE HIM APPROACH THE STOVE IN WHICH THERE WAS NEVER ANY FIRE
AND WHOSE PIPE YOU KNOW WAS OF MASTIC AND YELLOW CLAY
HIS BREATHING
WAS HOARSE HIS FACE LIVID HIS LIMBS FLACCID HIS BELLY PROMINENT
HE
SAID NOTHING
IF YOU SPOKE TO HIM HE DID NOT ANSWER
HE IS DEAD
HE WAS
TAKEN TO THE NECKER HOSPITAL WHERE I SAW HIM
I WAS HOUSE SURGEON IN
THAT HOSPITAL
NOW IF THERE ARE ANY FATHERS AMONG YOU FATHERS WHOSE
HAPPINESS IT IS TO STROLL ON SUNDAYS HOLDING THEIR CHILD'S TINY HAND IN
THEIR ROBUST HAND LET EACH ONE OF THOSE FATHERS IMAGINE THAT THIS CHILD
IS HIS OWN
THAT POOR BRAT I REMEMBER AND I SEEM TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN
HE LAY NUDE ON THE DISSECTING TABLE HOW HIS RIBS STOOD OUT ON HIS SKIN
LIKE THE GRAVES BENEATH THE GRASS IN A CEMETERY
A SORT OF MUD WAS FOUND
IN HIS STOMACH
THERE WERE ASHES IN HIS TEETH
COME LET US EXAMINE
OURSELVES CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND TAKE COUNSEL WITH OUR HEART
STATISTICS
SHOW THAT THE MORTALITY AMONG ABANDONED CHILDREN IS FIFTY FIVE PER CENT
I REPEAT IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN IT CONCERNS MOTHERS IT CONCERNS
YOUNG GIRLS IT CONCERNS LITTLE CHILDREN
WHO IS TALKING TO YOU OF
YOURSELVES WE KNOW WELL WHAT YOU ARE WE KNOW WELL THAT YOU ARE ALL
BRAVE PARBLEU WE KNOW WELL THAT YOU ALL HAVE IN YOUR SOULS THE JOY AND
THE GLORY OF GIVING YOUR LIFE FOR THE GREAT CAUSE WE KNOW WELL THAT YOU
FEEL YOURSELVES ELECTED TO DIE USEFULLY AND MAGNIFICENTLY AND THAT EACH
ONE OF YOU CLINGS TO HIS SHARE IN THE TRIUMPH
VERY WELL
BUT YOU ARE
NOT ALONE IN THIS WORLD
THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS OF WHOM YOU MUST THINK
YOU MUST NOT BE EGOISTS
ALL DROPPED THEIR HEADS WITH A GLOOMY AIR
STRANGE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS
COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN
HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS
OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWN
HE WAS ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF KILLED
HE
WAS AN EGOIST
MARIUS FASTING FEVERED HAVING EMERGED IN SUCCESSION FROM ALL HOPE
AND HAVING BEEN STRANDED IN GRIEF THE MOST SOMBRE OF SHIPWRECKS AND
SATURATED WITH VIOLENT EMOTIONS AND CONSCIOUS THAT THE END WAS NEAR
HAD PLUNGED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THAT VISIONARY STUPOR WHICH ALWAYS
PRECEDES THE FATAL HOUR VOLUNTARILY ACCEPTED
A PHYSIOLOGIST MIGHT HAVE STUDIED IN HIM THE GROWING SYMPTOMS OF THAT
FEBRILE ABSORPTION KNOWN TO AND CLASSIFIED BY SCIENCE AND WHICH IS
TO SUFFERING WHAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS TO PLEASURE
DESPAIR ALSO HAS ITS
ECSTASY
MARIUS HAD REACHED THIS POINT
HE LOOKED ON AT EVERYTHING AS
FROM WITHOUT AS WE HAVE SAID THINGS WHICH PASSED BEFORE HIM SEEMED FAR
AWAY HE MADE OUT THE WHOLE BUT DID NOT PERCEIVE THE DETAILS
HE BEHELD
MEN GOING AND COMING AS THROUGH A FLAME
HE HEARD VOICES SPEAKING AS AT
THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS
BUT THIS MOVED HIM
THERE WAS IN THIS SCENE A POINT WHICH PIERCED AND
ROUSED EVEN HIM
HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA NOW TO DIE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO
BE TURNED ASIDE FROM IT BUT HE REFLECTED IN HIS GLOOMY SOMNAMBULISM
THAT WHILE DESTROYING HIMSELF HE WAS NOT PROHIBITED FROM SAVING SOME
ONE ELSE
HE RAISED HIS VOICE
ENJOLRAS AND COMBEFERRE ARE RIGHT SAID HE NO UNNECESSARY SACRIFICE
I JOIN THEM AND YOU MUST MAKE HASTE
COMBEFERRE HAS SAID CONVINCING
THINGS TO YOU
THERE ARE SOME AMONG YOU WHO HAVE FAMILIES MOTHERS
SISTERS WIVES CHILDREN
LET SUCH LEAVE THE RANKS
NO ONE STIRRED
MARRIED MEN AND THE SUPPORTERS OF FAMILIES STEP OUT OF THE RANKS
REPEATED MARIUS
HIS AUTHORITY WAS GREAT
ENJOLRAS WAS CERTAINLY THE HEAD OF THE
BARRICADE BUT MARIUS WAS ITS SAVIOR
I ORDER IT CRIED ENJOLRAS
I ENTREAT YOU SAID MARIUS
THEN TOUCHED BY COMBEFERRE'S WORDS SHAKEN BY ENJOLRAS' ORDER TOUCHED
BY MARIUS' ENTREATY THESE HEROIC MEN BEGAN TO DENOUNCE EACH OTHER IT
IS TRUE SAID ONE YOUNG MAN TO A FULL GROWN MAN YOU ARE THE FATHER
OF A FAMILY
GO IT IS YOUR DUTY RATHER RETORTED THE MAN YOU HAVE
TWO SISTERS WHOM YOU MAINTAIN AND AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY BROKE
FORTH
EACH STRUGGLED TO DETERMINE WHICH SHOULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE
PLACED AT THE DOOR OF THE TOMB
MAKE HASTE SAID COURFEYRAC IN ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT WILL BE
TOO LATE
CITIZENS PURSUED ENJOLRAS THIS IS THE REPUBLIC AND UNIVERSAL
SUFFRAGE REIGNS
DO YOU YOURSELVES DESIGNATE THOSE WHO ARE TO GO
THEY OBEYED
AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES FIVE WERE
UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED AND STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS
THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM EXCLAIMED MARIUS
THERE WERE ONLY FOUR UNIFORMS
WELL BEGAN THE FIVE ONE MUST STAY BEHIND
AND THEN A STRUGGLE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD REMAIN AND WHO SHOULD FIND
REASONS FOR THE OTHERS NOT REMAINING
THE GENEROUS QUARREL BEGAN AFRESH
YOU HAVE A WIFE WHO LOVES YOU YOU HAVE YOUR AGED MOTHER YOU
HAVE NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER AND WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOUR THREE
LITTLE BROTHERS YOU ARE THE FATHER OF FIVE CHILDREN YOU HAVE A
RIGHT TO LIVE YOU ARE ONLY SEVENTEEN IT IS TOO EARLY FOR YOU TO DIE
THESE GREAT REVOLUTIONARY BARRICADES WERE ASSEMBLING POINTS FOR HEROISM
THE IMPROBABLE WAS SIMPLE THERE
THESE MEN DID NOT ASTONISH EACH OTHER
BE QUICK REPEATED COURFEYRAC
MEN SHOUTED TO MARIUS FROM THE GROUPS
DO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN
YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE
WE WILL OBEY YOU
MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTION
STILL
AT THIS IDEA THAT OF CHOOSING A MAN FOR DEATH HIS BLOOD RUSHED BACK
TO HIS HEART
HE WOULD HAVE TURNED PALE HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO
BECOME ANY PALER
HE ADVANCED TOWARDS THE FIVE WHO SMILED UPON HIM AND EACH WITH HIS
EYES FULL OF THAT GRAND FLAME WHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY
HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAE CRIED TO HIM
ME ME ME
AND MARIUS STUPIDLY COUNTED THEM THERE WERE STILL FIVE OF THEM THEN
HIS GLANCE DROPPED TO THE FOUR UNIFORMS
AT THAT MOMENT A FIFTH UNIFORM FELL AS IF FROM HEAVEN UPON THE OTHER
FOUR
THE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVED
MARIUS RAISED HIS EYES AND RECOGNIZED M
FAUCHELEVENT
JEAN VALJEAN HAD JUST ENTERED THE BARRICADE
HE HAD ARRIVED BY WAY OF MONDETOUR LANE WHITHER BY DINT OF INQUIRIES
MADE OR BY INSTINCT OR CHANCE
THANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL
GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO
OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN AND HE HAD
ALLOWED THE LATTER TO ENTANGLE HIMSELF IN THE STREET SAYING TO HIMSELF
PROBABLY IT IS A REINFORCEMENT IN ANY CASE IT IS A PRISONER THE
MOMENT WAS TOO GRAVE TO ADMIT OF THE SENTINEL ABANDONING HIS DUTY AND
HIS POST OF OBSERVATION
AT THE MOMENT WHEN JEAN VALJEAN ENTERED THE REDOUBT NO ONE HAD NOTICED
HIM ALL EYES BEING FIXED ON THE FIVE CHOSEN MEN AND THE FOUR UNIFORMS
JEAN VALJEAN ALSO HAD SEEN AND HEARD AND HE HAD SILENTLY REMOVED HIS
COAT AND FLUNG IT ON THE PILE WITH THE REST
THE EMOTION AROUSED WAS INDESCRIBABLE
WHO IS THIS MAN DEMANDED BOSSUET
HE IS A MAN WHO SAVES OTHERS REPLIED COMBEFERRE
MARIUS ADDED IN A GRAVE VOICE
I KNOW HIM
THIS GUARANTEE SATISFIED EVERY ONE
ENJOLRAS TURNED TO JEAN VALJEAN
WELCOME CITIZEN
AND HE ADDED
YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO DIE
JEAN VALJEAN WITHOUT REPLYING HELPED THE INSURGENT WHOM HE WAS SAVING
TO DON HIS UNIFORM
CHAPTER V THE HORIZON WHICH ONE BEHOLDS FROM THE SUMMIT OF A BARRICADE
THE SITUATION OF ALL IN THAT FATAL HOUR AND THAT PITILESS PLACE HAD AS
RESULT AND CULMINATING POINT ENJOLRAS' SUPREME MELANCHOLY
ENJOLRAS BORE WITHIN HIM THE PLENITUDE OF THE REVOLUTION HE WAS
INCOMPLETE HOWEVER SO FAR AS THE ABSOLUTE CAN BE SO HE HAD TOO MUCH
OF SAINT JUST ABOUT HIM AND NOT ENOUGH OF ANACHARSIS CLOOTS STILL
HIS MIND IN THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C HAD ENDED BY
UNDERGOING A CERTAIN POLARIZATION FROM COMBEFERRE'S IDEAS FOR SOME TIME
PAST HE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY EMERGING FROM THE NARROW FORM OF DOGMA AND
HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO INCLINE TO THE BROADENING INFLUENCE OF PROGRESS
AND HE HAD COME TO ACCEPT AS A DEFINITIVE AND MAGNIFICENT EVOLUTION
THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE GREAT FRENCH REPUBLIC INTO THE IMMENSE
HUMAN REPUBLIC
AS FAR AS THE IMMEDIATE MEANS WERE CONCERNED A VIOLENT
SITUATION BEING GIVEN HE WISHED TO BE VIOLENT ON THAT POINT HE NEVER
VARIED AND HE REMAINED OF THAT EPIC AND REDOUBTABLE SCHOOL WHICH IS
SUMMED UP IN THE WORDS EIGHTY THREE ENJOLRAS WAS STANDING ERECT ON
THE STAIRCASE OF PAVING STONES ONE ELBOW RESTING ON THE STOCK OF
HIS GUN
HE WAS ENGAGED IN THOUGHT HE QUIVERED AS AT THE PASSAGE OF
PROPHETIC BREATHS PLACES WHERE DEATH IS HAVE THESE EFFECTS OF TRIPODS
A SORT OF STIFLED FIRE DARTED FROM HIS EYES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH AN
INWARD LOOK
ALL AT ONCE HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD HIS BLOND LOCKS FELL
BACK LIKE THOSE OF AN ANGEL ON THE SOMBRE QUADRIGA MADE OF STARS THEY
WERE LIKE THE MANE OF A STARTLED LION IN THE FLAMING OF AN HALO AND
ENJOLRAS CRIED
CITIZENS DO YOU PICTURE THE FUTURE TO YOURSELVES THE STREETS OF
CITIES INUNDATED WITH LIGHT GREEN BRANCHES ON THE THRESHOLDS NATIONS
SISTERS MEN JUST OLD MEN BLESSING CHILDREN THE PAST LOVING THE
PRESENT THINKERS ENTIRELY AT LIBERTY BELIEVERS ON TERMS OF FULL
EQUALITY FOR RELIGION HEAVEN GOD THE DIRECT PRIEST HUMAN CONSCIENCE
BECOME AN ALTAR NO MORE HATREDS THE FRATERNITY OF THE WORKSHOP AND THE
SCHOOL FOR SOLE PENALTY AND RECOMPENSE FAME WORK FOR ALL RIGHT FOR
ALL PEACE OVER ALL NO MORE BLOODSHED NO MORE WARS HAPPY MOTHERS TO
CONQUER MATTER IS THE FIRST STEP TO REALIZE THE IDEAL IS THE SECOND
REFLECT ON WHAT PROGRESS HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
FORMERLY THE
FIRST HUMAN RACES BEHELD WITH TERROR THE HYDRA PASS BEFORE THEIR EYES
BREATHING ON THE WATERS THE DRAGON WHICH VOMITED FLAME THE GRIFFIN WHO
WAS THE MONSTER OF THE AIR AND WHO FLEW WITH THE WINGS OF AN EAGLE
AND THE TALONS OF A TIGER FEARFUL BEASTS WHICH WERE ABOVE MAN
MAN
NEVERTHELESS SPREAD HIS SNARES CONSECRATED BY INTELLIGENCE AND
FINALLY CONQUERED THESE MONSTERS
WE HAVE VANQUISHED THE HYDRA AND
IT IS CALLED THE LOCOMOTIVE WE ARE ON THE POINT OF VANQUISHING THE
GRIFFIN WE ALREADY GRASP IT AND IT IS CALLED THE BALLOON
ON THE DAY
WHEN THIS PROMETHEAN TASK SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN MAN SHALL HAVE
DEFINITELY HARNESSED TO HIS WILL THE TRIPLE CHIMAERA OF ANTIQUITY THE
HYDRA THE DRAGON AND THE GRIFFIN HE WILL BE THE MASTER OF WATER FIRE
AND OF AIR AND HE WILL BE FOR THE REST OF ANIMATED CREATION THAT WHICH
THE ANCIENT GODS FORMERLY WERE TO HIM
COURAGE AND ONWARD CITIZENS
WHITHER ARE WE GOING TO SCIENCE MADE GOVERNMENT TO THE FORCE OF THINGS
BECOME THE SOLE PUBLIC FORCE TO THE NATURAL LAW HAVING IN ITSELF ITS
SANCTION AND ITS PENALTY AND PROMULGATING ITSELF BY EVIDENCE TO A DAWN
OF TRUTH CORRESPONDING TO A DAWN OF DAY
WE ARE ADVANCING TO THE UNION
OF PEOPLES WE ARE ADVANCING TO THE UNITY OF MAN
NO MORE FICTIONS
NO MORE PARASITES
THE REAL GOVERNED BY THE TRUE THAT IS THE GOAL
CIVILIZATION WILL HOLD ITS ASSIZES AT THE SUMMIT OF EUROPE AND
LATER ON AT THE CENTRE OF CONTINENTS IN A GRAND PARLIAMENT OF THE
INTELLIGENCE
SOMETHING SIMILAR HAS ALREADY BEEN SEEN
THE AMPHICTYONS
HAD TWO SITTINGS A YEAR ONE AT DELPHOS THE SEAT OF THE GODS THE OTHER
AT THERMOPYLAE THE PLACE OF HEROES
EUROPE WILL HAVE HER AMPHICTYONS
THE GLOBE WILL HAVE ITS AMPHICTYONS
FRANCE BEARS THIS SUBLIME FUTURE IN
HER BREAST
THIS IS THE GESTATION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
THAT WHICH
GREECE SKETCHED OUT IS WORTHY OF BEING FINISHED BY FRANCE
LISTEN TO ME
YOU FEUILLY VALIANT ARTISAN MAN OF THE PEOPLE
I REVERE YOU
YES YOU
CLEARLY BEHOLD THE FUTURE YES YOU ARE RIGHT
YOU HAD NEITHER FATHER
NOR MOTHER FEUILLY YOU ADOPTED HUMANITY FOR YOUR MOTHER AND RIGHT
FOR YOUR FATHER
YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE THAT IS TO SAY TO TRIUMPH HERE
CITIZENS WHATEVER HAPPENS TO DAY THROUGH OUR DEFEAT AS WELL AS
THROUGH OUR VICTORY IT IS A REVOLUTION THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO CREATE
AS CONFLAGRATIONS LIGHT UP A WHOLE CITY SO REVOLUTIONS ILLUMINATE THE
WHOLE HUMAN RACE
AND WHAT IS THE REVOLUTION THAT WE SHALL CAUSE I HAVE
JUST TOLD YOU THE REVOLUTION OF THE TRUE
FROM A POLITICAL POINT OF
VIEW THERE IS BUT A SINGLE PRINCIPLE THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MAN OVER
HIMSELF
THIS SOVEREIGNTY OF MYSELF OVER MYSELF IS CALLED LIBERTY
WHERE
TWO OR THREE OF THESE SOVEREIGNTIES ARE COMBINED THE STATE BEGINS
BUT
IN THAT ASSOCIATION THERE IS NO ABDICATION
EACH SOVEREIGNTY CONCEDES A
CERTAIN QUANTITY OF ITSELF FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING THE COMMON RIGHT
THIS QUANTITY IS THE SAME FOR ALL OF US
THIS IDENTITY OF CONCESSION
WHICH EACH MAKES TO ALL IS CALLED EQUALITY
COMMON RIGHT IS NOTHING
ELSE THAN THE PROTECTION OF ALL BEAMING ON THE RIGHT OF EACH
THIS
PROTECTION OF ALL OVER EACH IS CALLED FRATERNITY
THE POINT OF
INTERSECTION OF ALL THESE ASSEMBLED SOVEREIGNTIES IS CALLED SOCIETY
THIS INTERSECTION BEING A JUNCTION THIS POINT IS A KNOT
HENCE WHAT
IS CALLED THE SOCIAL BOND
SOME SAY SOCIAL CONTRACT WHICH IS THE SAME
THING THE WORD CONTRACT BEING ETYMOLOGICALLY FORMED WITH THE IDEA OF A
BOND
LET US COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT EQUALITY FOR IF LIBERTY
IS THE SUMMIT EQUALITY IS THE BASE
EQUALITY CITIZENS IS NOT WHOLLY A
SURFACE VEGETATION A SOCIETY OF GREAT BLADES OF GRASS AND TINY OAKS A
PROXIMITY OF JEALOUSIES WHICH RENDER EACH OTHER NULL AND VOID LEGALLY
SPEAKING IT IS ALL APTITUDES POSSESSED OF THE SAME OPPORTUNITY
POLITICALLY IT IS ALL VOTES POSSESSED OF THE SAME WEIGHT RELIGIOUSLY
IT IS ALL CONSCIENCES POSSESSED OF THE SAME RIGHT
EQUALITY HAS AN
ORGAN GRATUITOUS AND OBLIGATORY INSTRUCTION
THE RIGHT TO THE ALPHABET
THAT IS WHERE THE BEGINNING MUST BE MADE
THE PRIMARY SCHOOL IMPOSED
ON ALL THE SECONDARY SCHOOL OFFERED TO ALL THAT IS THE LAW
FROM AN
IDENTICAL SCHOOL AN IDENTICAL SOCIETY WILL SPRING
YES INSTRUCTION
LIGHT LIGHT EVERYTHING COMES FROM LIGHT AND TO IT EVERYTHING RETURNS
CITIZENS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS GREAT BUT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
WILL BE HAPPY
THEN THERE WILL BE NOTHING MORE LIKE THE HISTORY OF OLD
WE SHALL NO LONGER AS TO DAY HAVE TO FEAR A CONQUEST AN INVASION
A USURPATION A RIVALRY OF NATIONS ARMS IN HAND AN INTERRUPTION OF
CIVILIZATION DEPENDING ON A MARRIAGE OF KINGS ON A BIRTH IN HEREDITARY
TYRANNIES A PARTITION OF PEOPLES BY A CONGRESS A DISMEMBERMENT BECAUSE
OF THE FAILURE OF A DYNASTY A COMBAT OF TWO RELIGIONS MEETING FACE
TO FACE LIKE TWO BUCKS IN THE DARK ON THE BRIDGE OF THE INFINITE WE
SHALL NO LONGER HAVE TO FEAR FAMINE FARMING OUT PROSTITUTION ARISING
FROM DISTRESS MISERY FROM THE FAILURE OF WORK AND THE SCAFFOLD AND THE
SWORD AND BATTLES AND THE RUFFIANISM OF CHANCE IN THE FOREST OF EVENTS
ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THERE WILL BE NO MORE EVENTS
WE SHALL BE HAPPY
THE HUMAN RACE WILL ACCOMPLISH ITS LAW AS THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE
ACCOMPLISHES ITS LAW HARMONY WILL BE RE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE SOUL
AND THE STAR THE SOUL WILL GRAVITATE AROUND THE TRUTH AS THE PLANET
AROUND THE LIGHT
FRIENDS THE PRESENT HOUR IN WHICH I AM ADDRESSING
YOU IS A GLOOMY HOUR BUT THESE ARE TERRIBLE PURCHASES OF THE FUTURE
A REVOLUTION IS A TOLL
OH THE HUMAN RACE WILL BE DELIVERED RAISED UP
CONSOLED WE AFFIRM IT ON THIS BARRIER
WHENCE SHOULD PROCEED THAT CRY
OF LOVE IF NOT FROM THE HEIGHTS OF SACRIFICE OH MY BROTHERS THIS IS
THE POINT OF JUNCTION OF THOSE WHO THINK AND OF THOSE WHO SUFFER THIS
BARRICADE IS NOT MADE OF PAVING STONES NOR OF JOISTS NOR OF BITS OF
IRON IT IS MADE OF TWO HEAPS A HEAP OF IDEAS AND A HEAP OF WOES
HERE
MISERY MEETS THE IDEAL
THE DAY EMBRACES THE NIGHT AND SAYS TO IT 'I
AM ABOUT TO DIE AND THOU SHALT BE BORN AGAIN WITH ME FROM THE EMBRACE
OF ALL DESOLATIONS FAITH LEAPS FORTH
SUFFERINGS BRING HITHER THEIR
AGONY AND IDEAS THEIR IMMORTALITY
THIS AGONY AND THIS IMMORTALITY ARE
ABOUT TO JOIN AND CONSTITUTE OUR DEATH
BROTHERS HE WHO DIES HERE DIES
IN THE RADIANCE OF THE FUTURE AND WE ARE ENTERING A TOMB ALL FLOODED
WITH THE DAWN
ENJOLRAS PAUSED RATHER THAN BECAME SILENT HIS LIPS CONTINUED TO MOVE
SILENTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF WHICH CAUSED THEM ALL
TO GAZE ATTENTIVELY AT HIM IN THE ENDEAVOR TO HEAR MORE
THERE WAS NO
APPLAUSE BUT THEY WHISPERED TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME
SPEECH BEING A
BREATH THE RUSTLING OF INTELLIGENCES RESEMBLES THE RUSTLING OF LEAVES
CHAPTER VI MARIUS HAGGARD JAVERT LACONIC
LET US NARRATE WHAT WAS PASSING IN MARIUS' THOUGHTS
LET THE READER RECALL THE STATE OF HIS SOUL
WE HAVE JUST RECALLED IT
EVERYTHING WAS A VISION TO HIM NOW
HIS JUDGMENT WAS DISTURBED
MARIUS
LET US INSIST ON THIS POINT WAS UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT DARK
WINGS WHICH ARE SPREAD OVER THOSE IN THE DEATH AGONY
HE FELT THAT HE
HAD ENTERED THE TOMB IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE WALL AND HE NO LONGER BEHELD THE FACES OF THE LIVING EXCEPT
WITH THE EYES OF ONE DEAD
HOW DID M
FAUCHELEVENT COME THERE WHY WAS HE THERE WHAT HAD HE COME
THERE TO DO MARIUS DID NOT ADDRESS ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF
BESIDES SINCE OUR DESPAIR HAS THIS PECULIARITY THAT IT ENVELOPS OTHERS
AS WELL AS OURSELVES IT SEEMED LOGICAL TO HIM THAT ALL THE WORLD SHOULD
COME THITHER TO DIE
ONLY HE THOUGHT OF COSETTE WITH A PANG AT HIS HEART
HOWEVER M
FAUCHELEVENT DID NOT SPEAK TO HIM DID NOT LOOK AT HIM AND
HAD NOT EVEN THE AIR OF HEARING HIM WHEN MARIUS RAISED HIS VOICE TO
SAY I KNOW HIM
AS FAR AS MARIUS WAS CONCERNED THIS ATTITUDE OF M
FAUCHELEVENT WAS
COMFORTING AND IF SUCH A WORD CAN BE USED FOR SUCH IMPRESSIONS
WE SHOULD SAY THAT IT PLEASED HIM
HE HAD ALWAYS FELT THE ABSOLUTE
IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADDRESSING THAT ENIGMATICAL MAN WHO WAS IN HIS EYES
BOTH EQUIVOCAL AND IMPOSING
MOREOVER IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
HE HAD SEEN HIM AND THIS STILL FURTHER AUGMENTED THE IMPOSSIBILITY FOR
MARIUS' TIMID AND RESERVED NATURE
THE FIVE CHOSEN MEN LEFT THE BARRICADE BY WAY OF MONDETOUR LANE THEY
BORE A PERFECT RESEMBLANCE TO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
ONE OF THEM
WEPT AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
BEFORE SETTING OUT THEY EMBRACED THOSE WHO
REMAINED
WHEN THE FIVE MEN SENT BACK TO LIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE ENJOLRAS
THOUGHT OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH
HE ENTERED THE TAP ROOM
JAVERT STILL BOUND TO THE POST WAS ENGAGED IN
MEDITATION
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING ENJOLRAS ASKED HIM
JAVERT REPLIED WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME
WAIT
WE NEED ALL OUR CARTRIDGES JUST AT PRESENT
THEN GIVE ME A DRINK SAID JAVERT
ENJOLRAS HIMSELF OFFERED HIM A GLASS OF WATER AND AS JAVERT WAS
PINIONED HE HELPED HIM TO DRINK
IS THAT ALL INQUIRED ENJOLRAS
I AM UNCOMFORTABLE AGAINST THIS POST REPLIED JAVERT
YOU ARE NOT
TENDER TO HAVE LEFT ME TO PASS THE NIGHT HERE
BIND ME AS YOU PLEASE
BUT YOU SURELY MIGHT LAY ME OUT ON A TABLE LIKE THAT OTHER MAN
AND WITH A MOTION OF THE HEAD HE INDICATED THE BODY OF M
MABEUF
THERE WAS AS THE READER WILL REMEMBER A LONG BROAD TABLE AT THE
END OF THE ROOM ON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN RUNNING BULLETS AND MAKING
CARTRIDGES
ALL THE CARTRIDGES HAVING BEEN MADE AND ALL THE POWDER
USED THIS TABLE WAS FREE
AT ENJOLRAS' COMMAND FOUR INSURGENTS UNBOUND JAVERT FROM THE POST
WHILE THEY WERE LOOSING HIM A FIFTH HELD A BAYONET AGAINST HIS BREAST
LEAVING HIS ARMS TIED BEHIND HIS BACK THEY PLACED ABOUT HIS FEET A
SLENDER BUT STOUT WHIP CORD AS IS DONE TO MEN ON THE POINT OF MOUNTING
THE SCAFFOLD WHICH ALLOWED HIM TO TAKE STEPS ABOUT FIFTEEN INCHES IN
LENGTH AND MADE HIM WALK TO THE TABLE AT THE END OF THE ROOM WHERE
THEY LAID HIM DOWN CLOSELY BOUND ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
BY WAY OF FURTHER SECURITY AND BY MEANS OF A ROPE FASTENED TO HIS NECK
THEY ADDED TO THE SYSTEM OF LIGATURES WHICH RENDERED EVERY ATTEMPT
AT ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SORT OF BOND WHICH IS CALLED IN PRISONS A
MARTINGALE WHICH STARTING AT THE NECK FORKS ON THE STOMACH AND MEETS
THE HANDS AFTER PASSING BETWEEN THE LEGS
WHILE THEY WERE BINDING JAVERT A MAN STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD WAS
SURVEYING HIM WITH SINGULAR ATTENTION
THE SHADOW CAST BY THIS MAN MADE
JAVERT TURN HIS HEAD
HE RAISED HIS EYES AND RECOGNIZED JEAN VALJEAN
HE DID NOT EVEN START BUT DROPPED HIS LIDS PROUDLY AND CONFINED HIMSELF
TO THE REMARK IT IS PERFECTLY SIMPLE
CHAPTER VII THE SITUATION BECOMES AGGRAVATED
THE DAYLIGHT WAS INCREASING RAPIDLY
NOT A WINDOW WAS OPENED NOT A DOOR
STOOD AJAR IT WAS THE DAWN BUT NOT THE AWAKING
THE END OF THE RUE DE
LA CHANVRERIE OPPOSITE THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN EVACUATED BY THE
TROOPS AS WE HAVE STATED IT SEEMED TO BE FREE AND PRESENTED ITSELF TO
PASSERS BY WITH A SINISTER TRANQUILLITY
THE RUE SAINT DENIS WAS AS
DUMB AS THE AVENUE OF SPHINXES AT THEBES
NOT A LIVING BEING IN THE
CROSS ROADS WHICH GLEAMED WHITE IN THE LIGHT OF THE SUN
NOTHING IS SO
MOURNFUL AS THIS LIGHT IN DESERTED STREETS
NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT
THERE WAS SOMETHING TO BE HEARD
A MYSTERIOUS MOVEMENT WAS GOING ON AT
A CERTAIN DISTANCE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE CRITICAL MOMENT WAS
APPROACHING
AS ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING THE SENTINELS HAD COME IN BUT
THIS TIME ALL HAD COME
THE BARRICADE WAS STRONGER THAN ON THE OCCASION OF THE FIRST ATTACK
SINCE THE DEPARTURE OF THE FIVE THEY HAD INCREASED ITS HEIGHT STILL
FURTHER
ON THE ADVICE OF THE SENTINEL WHO HAD EXAMINED THE REGION OF THE
HALLES ENJOLRAS FOR FEAR OF A SURPRISE IN THE REAR CAME TO A SERIOUS
DECISION
HE HAD THE SMALL GUT OF THE MONDETOUR LANE WHICH HAD BEEN
LEFT OPEN UP TO THAT TIME BARRICADED
FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY TORE UP
THE PAVEMENT FOR THE LENGTH OF SEVERAL HOUSES MORE
IN THIS MANNER
THE BARRICADE WALLED ON THREE STREETS IN FRONT ON THE RUE DE
LA CHANVRERIE TO THE LEFT ON THE RUES DU CYGNE AND DE LA PETITE
TRUANDERIE TO THE RIGHT ON THE RUE MONDETOUR WAS REALLY ALMOST
IMPREGNABLE IT IS TRUE THAT THEY WERE FATALLY HEMMED IN THERE
IT
HAD THREE FRONTS BUT NO EXIT A FORTRESS BUT A RAT HOLE TOO SAID
COURFEYRAC WITH A LAUGH
ENJOLRAS HAD ABOUT THIRTY PAVING STONES TORN UP IN EXCESS SAID
BOSSUET PILED UP NEAR THE DOOR OF THE WINE SHOP
THE SILENCE WAS NOW SO PROFOUND IN THE QUARTER WHENCE THE ATTACK MUST
NEEDS COME THAT ENJOLRAS HAD EACH MAN RESUME HIS POST OF BATTLE
AN ALLOWANCE OF BRANDY WAS DOLED OUT TO EACH
NOTHING IS MORE CURIOUS THAN A BARRICADE PREPARING FOR AN ASSAULT
EACH
MAN SELECTS HIS PLACE AS THOUGH AT THE THEATRE
THEY JOSTLE AND ELBOW
AND CROWD EACH OTHER
THERE ARE SOME WHO MAKE STALLS OF PAVING STONES
HERE IS A CORNER OF THE WALL WHICH IS IN THE WAY IT IS REMOVED HERE
IS A REDAN WHICH MAY AFFORD PROTECTION THEY TAKE SHELTER BEHIND IT
LEFT HANDED MEN ARE PRECIOUS THEY TAKE THE PLACES THAT ARE INCONVENIENT
TO THE REST
MANY ARRANGE TO FIGHT IN A SITTING POSTURE
THEY WISH TO BE
AT EASE TO KILL AND TO DIE COMFORTABLY
IN THE SAD WAR OF JUNE 1848
AN INSURGENT WHO WAS A FORMIDABLE MARKSMAN AND WHO WAS FIRING FROM THE
TOP OF A TERRACE UPON A ROOF HAD A RECLINING CHAIR BROUGHT THERE FOR
HIS USE A CHARGE OF GRAPE SHOT FOUND HIM OUT THERE
AS SOON AS THE LEADER HAS GIVEN THE ORDER TO CLEAR THE DECKS FOR ACTION
ALL DISORDERLY MOVEMENTS CEASE THERE IS NO MORE PULLING FROM ONE
ANOTHER THERE ARE NO MORE COTERIES NO MORE ASIDES THERE IS NO MORE
HOLDING ALOOF EVERYTHING IN THEIR SPIRITS CONVERGES IN AND CHANGES
INTO A WAITING FOR THE ASSAILANTS
A BARRICADE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF
DANGER IS CHAOS IN DANGER IT IS DISCIPLINE ITSELF
PERIL PRODUCES
ORDER
AS SOON AS ENJOLRAS HAD SEIZED HIS DOUBLE BARRELLED RIFLE AND HAD
PLACED HIMSELF IN A SORT OF EMBRASURE WHICH HE HAD RESERVED FOR HIMSELF
ALL THE REST HELD THEIR PEACE
A SERIES OF FAINT SHARP NOISES RESOUNDED
CONFUSEDLY ALONG THE WALL OF PAVING STONES
IT WAS THE MEN COCKING THEIR
GUNS
MOREOVER THEIR ATTITUDES WERE PROUDER MORE CONFIDENT THAN EVER THE
EXCESS OF SACRIFICE STRENGTHENS THEY NO LONGER CHERISHED ANY HOPE
BUT THEY HAD DESPAIR DESPAIR THE LAST WEAPON WHICH SOMETIMES GIVES
VICTORY VIRGIL HAS SAID SO
SUPREME RESOURCES SPRING FROM EXTREME
RESOLUTIONS
TO EMBARK IN DEATH IS SOMETIMES THE MEANS OF ESCAPING A
SHIPWRECK AND THE LID OF THE COFFIN BECOMES A PLANK OF SAFETY
AS ON THE PRECEDING EVENING THE ATTENTION OF ALL WAS DIRECTED WE
MIGHT ALMOST SAY LEANED UPON THE END OF THE STREET NOW LIGHTED UP AND
VISIBLE
THEY HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT
A STIR BEGAN DISTINCTLY IN THE SAINT LEU
QUARTER BUT IT DID NOT RESEMBLE THE MOVEMENT OF THE FIRST ATTACK
A
CLASHING OF CHAINS THE UNEASY JOLTING OF A MASS THE CLICK OF BRASS
SKIPPING ALONG THE PAVEMENT A SORT OF SOLEMN UPROAR ANNOUNCED THAT
SOME SINISTER CONSTRUCTION OF IRON WAS APPROACHING
THERE AROSE A TREMOR
IN THE BOSOMS OF THESE PEACEFUL OLD STREETS PIERCED AND BUILT FOR THE
FERTILE CIRCULATION OF INTERESTS AND IDEAS AND WHICH ARE NOT MADE FOR
THE HORRIBLE RUMBLE OF THE WHEELS OF WAR
THE FIXITY OF EYE IN ALL THE COMBATANTS UPON THE EXTREMITY OF THE STREET
BECAME FEROCIOUS
A CANNON MADE ITS APPEARANCE
ARTILLERY MEN WERE PUSHING THE PIECE IT WAS IN FIRING TRIM THE
FORE CARRIAGE HAD BEEN DETACHED TWO UPHELD THE GUN CARRIAGE FOUR WERE
AT THE WHEELS OTHERS FOLLOWED WITH THE CAISSON
THEY COULD SEE THE
SMOKE OF THE BURNING LINT STOCK
FIRE SHOUTED ENJOLRAS
THE WHOLE BARRICADE FIRED THE REPORT WAS TERRIBLE AN AVALANCHE OF
SMOKE COVERED AND EFFACED BOTH CANNON AND MEN AFTER A FEW SECONDS THE
CLOUD DISPERSED AND THE CANNON AND MEN RE APPEARED THE GUN CREW HAD
JUST FINISHED ROLLING IT SLOWLY CORRECTLY WITHOUT HASTE INTO POSITION
FACING THE BARRICADE
NOT ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN STRUCK
THEN THE CAPTAIN
OF THE PIECE BEARING DOWN UPON THE BREECH IN ORDER TO RAISE THE MUZZLE
BEGAN TO POINT THE CANNON WITH THE GRAVITY OF AN ASTRONOMER LEVELLING A
TELESCOPE
BRAVO FOR THE CANNONEERS CRIED BOSSUET
AND THE WHOLE BARRICADE CLAPPED THEIR HANDS
A MOMENT LATER SQUARELY PLANTED IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE STREET
ASTRIDE OF THE GUTTER THE PIECE WAS READY FOR ACTION
A FORMIDABLE PAIR
OF JAWS YAWNED ON THE BARRICADE
COME MERRILY NOW EJACULATED COURFEYRAC
THAT'S THE BRUTAL PART OF
IT
AFTER THE FILLIP ON THE NOSE THE BLOW FROM THE FIST
THE ARMY IS
REACHING OUT ITS BIG PAW TO US
THE BARRICADE IS GOING TO BE SEVERELY
SHAKEN UP
THE FUSILLADE TRIES THE CANNON TAKES
IT IS A PIECE OF EIGHT NEW MODEL BRASS ADDED COMBEFERRE
THOSE
PIECES ARE LIABLE TO BURST AS SOON AS THE PROPORTION OF TEN PARTS OF TIN
TO ONE HUNDRED OF BRASS IS EXCEEDED
THE EXCESS OF TIN RENDERS THEM TOO
TENDER
THEN IT COMES TO PASS THAT THEY HAVE CAVES AND CHAMBERS WHEN
LOOKED AT FROM THE VENT HOLE
IN ORDER TO OBVIATE THIS DANGER AND
TO RENDER IT POSSIBLE TO FORCE THE CHARGE IT MAY BECOME NECESSARY
TO RETURN TO THE PROCESS OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY HOOPING AND TO
ENCIRCLE THE PIECE ON THE OUTSIDE WITH A SERIES OF UNWELDED STEEL BANDS
FROM THE BREECH TO THE TRUNNIONS
IN THE MEANTIME THEY REMEDY THIS
DEFECT AS BEST THEY MAY THEY MANAGE TO DISCOVER WHERE THE HOLES ARE
LOCATED IN THE VENT OF A CANNON BY MEANS OF A SEARCHER
BUT THERE IS A
BETTER METHOD WITH GRIBEAUVAL'S MOVABLE STAR
IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY REMARKED BOSSUET THEY USED TO RIFLE
CANNON
YES REPLIED COMBEFERRE THAT AUGMENTS THE PROJECTILE FORCE BUT
DIMINISHES THE ACCURACY OF THE FIRING
IN FIRING AT SHORT RANGE
THE TRAJECTORY IS NOT AS RIGID AS COULD BE DESIRED THE PARABOLA IS
EXAGGERATED THE LINE OF THE PROJECTILE IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENTLY
RECTILINEAR TO ALLOW OF ITS STRIKING INTERVENING OBJECTS WHICH IS
NEVERTHELESS A NECESSITY OF BATTLE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH INCREASES
WITH THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENEMY AND THE PRECIPITATION OF THE DISCHARGE
THIS DEFECT OF THE TENSION OF THE CURVE OF THE PROJECTILE IN THE RIFLED
CANNON OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AROSE FROM THE SMALLNESS OF THE CHARGE
SMALL CHARGES FOR THAT SORT OF ENGINE ARE IMPOSED BY THE BALLISTIC
NECESSITIES SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS THE PRESERVATION OF THE
GUN CARRIAGE
IN SHORT THAT DESPOT THE CANNON CANNOT DO ALL THAT
IT DESIRES FORCE IS A GREAT WEAKNESS
A CANNON BALL ONLY TRAVELS
SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES AN HOUR LIGHT TRAVELS SEVENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES A
SECOND
SUCH IS THE SUPERIORITY OF JESUS CHRIST OVER NAPOLEON
RELOAD YOUR GUNS SAID ENJOLRAS
HOW WAS THE CASING OF THE BARRICADE GOING TO BEHAVE UNDER THE
CANNON BALLS WOULD THEY EFFECT A BREACH THAT WAS THE QUESTION
WHILE
THE INSURGENTS WERE RELOADING THEIR GUNS THE ARTILLERY MEN WERE LOADING
THE CANNON
THE ANXIETY IN THE REDOUBT WAS PROFOUND
THE SHOT SPED THE REPORT BURST FORTH
PRESENT SHOUTED A JOYOUS VOICE
AND GAVROCHE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO THE BARRICADE JUST AS THE BALL DASHED
AGAINST IT
HE CAME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE RUE DU CYGNE AND HE HAD NIMBLY
CLIMBED OVER THE AUXILIARY BARRICADE WHICH FRONTED ON THE LABYRINTH OF
THE RUE DE LA PETITE TRUANDERIE
GAVROCHE PRODUCED A GREATER SENSATION IN THE BARRICADE THAN THE
CANNON BALL
THE BALL BURIED ITSELF IN THE MASS OF RUBBISH
AT THE MOST THERE WAS AN
OMNIBUS WHEEL BROKEN AND THE OLD ANCEAU CART WAS DEMOLISHED
ON SEEING
THIS THE BARRICADE BURST INTO A LAUGH
GO ON SHOUTED BOSSUET TO THE ARTILLERISTS
CHAPTER VIII THE ARTILLERY MEN COMPEL PEOPLE TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY
THEY FLOCKED ROUND GAVROCHE
BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO TELL ANYTHING
MARIUS
DREW HIM ASIDE WITH A SHUDDER
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
HULLO SAID THE CHILD WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE YOURSELF
AND HE STARED AT MARIUS INTENTLY WITH HIS EPIC EFFRONTERY
HIS EYES GREW
LARGER WITH THE PROUD LIGHT WITHIN THEM
IT WAS WITH AN ACCENT OF SEVERITY THAT MARIUS CONTINUED
WHO TOLD YOU TO COME BACK DID YOU DELIVER MY LETTER AT THE ADDRESS
GAVROCHE WAS NOT WITHOUT SOME COMPUNCTIONS IN THE MATTER OF THAT LETTER
IN HIS HASTE TO RETURN TO THE BARRICADE HE HAD GOT RID OF IT RATHER
THAN DELIVERED IT
HE WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD
CONFIDED IT RATHER LIGHTLY TO THAT STRANGER WHOSE FACE HE HAD NOT BEEN
ABLE TO MAKE OUT
IT IS TRUE THAT THE MAN WAS BAREHEADED BUT THAT WAS
NOT SUFFICIENT
IN SHORT HE HAD BEEN ADMINISTERING TO HIMSELF LITTLE
INWARD REMONSTRANCES AND HE FEARED MARIUS' REPROACHES
IN ORDER TO
EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM THE PREDICAMENT HE TOOK THE SIMPLEST COURSE HE
LIED ABOMINABLY
CITIZEN I DELIVERED THE LETTER TO THE PORTER
THE LADY WAS ASLEEP
SHE
WILL HAVE THE LETTER WHEN SHE WAKES UP
MARIUS HAD HAD TWO OBJECTS IN SENDING THAT LETTER TO BID FAREWELL TO
COSETTE AND TO SAVE GAVROCHE
HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE
HALF OF HIS DESIRE
THE DESPATCH OF HIS LETTER AND THE PRESENCE OF M
FAUCHELEVENT IN THE
BARRICADE WAS A COINCIDENCE WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
HE POINTED OUT M
FAUCHELEVENT TO GAVROCHE
DO YOU KNOW THAT MAN
NO SAID GAVROCHE
GAVROCHE HAD IN FACT AS WE HAVE JUST MENTIONED SEEN JEAN VALJEAN ONLY
AT NIGHT
THE TROUBLED AND UNHEALTHY CONJECTURES WHICH HAD OUTLINED THEMSELVES IN
MARIUS' MIND WERE DISSIPATED
DID HE KNOW M
FAUCHELEVENT'S OPINIONS
PERHAPS M
FAUCHELEVENT WAS A REPUBLICAN
HENCE HIS VERY NATURAL
PRESENCE IN THIS COMBAT
IN THE MEANWHILE GAVROCHE WAS SHOUTING AT THE OTHER END OF THE
BARRICADE MY GUN
COURFEYRAC HAD IT RETURNED TO HIM
GAVROCHE WARNED HIS COMRADES AS HE CALLED THEM THAT THE BARRICADE WAS
BLOCKED
HE HAD HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN REACHING IT
A BATTALION OF THE
LINE WHOSE ARMS WERE PILED IN THE RUE DE LA PETITE TRUANDERIE WAS ON
THE WATCH ON THE SIDE OF THE RUE DU CYGNE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE
MUNICIPAL GUARD OCCUPIED THE RUE DES PRECHEURS
THE BULK OF THE ARMY WAS
FACING THEM IN FRONT
THIS INFORMATION GIVEN GAVROCHE ADDED
I AUTHORIZE YOU TO HIT 'EM A TREMENDOUS WHACK
MEANWHILE ENJOLRAS WAS STRAINING HIS EARS AND WATCHING AT HIS
EMBRASURE
THE ASSAILANTS DISSATISFIED NO DOUBT WITH THEIR SHOT HAD NOT
REPEATED IT
A COMPANY OF INFANTRY OF THE LINE HAD COME UP AND OCCUPIED THE END OF
THE STREET BEHIND THE PIECE OF ORDNANCE
THE SOLDIERS WERE TEARING UP
THE PAVEMENT AND CONSTRUCTING WITH THE STONES A SMALL LOW WALL A
SORT OF SIDE WORK NOT MORE THAN EIGHTEEN INCHES HIGH AND FACING THE
BARRICADE
IN THE ANGLE AT THE LEFT OF THIS EPAULEMENT THERE WAS
VISIBLE THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN OF A BATTALION FROM THE SUBURBS MASSED IN
THE RUE SAINT DENIS
ENJOLRAS ON THE WATCH THOUGHT HE DISTINGUISHED THE PECULIAR SOUND
WHICH IS PRODUCED WHEN THE SHELLS OF GRAPE SHOT ARE DRAWN FROM THE
CAISSONS AND HE SAW THE COMMANDER OF THE PIECE CHANGE THE ELEVATION
AND INCLINE THE MOUTH OF THE CANNON SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT
THEN THE
CANNONEERS BEGAN TO LOAD THE PIECE
THE CHIEF SEIZED THE LINT STOCK
HIMSELF AND LOWERED IT TO THE VENT
DOWN WITH YOUR HEADS HUG THE WALL SHOUTED ENJOLRAS AND ALL ON YOUR
KNEES ALONG THE BARRICADE
THE INSURGENTS WHO WERE STRAGGLING IN FRONT OF THE WINE SHOP AND
WHO HAD QUITTED THEIR POSTS OF COMBAT ON GAVROCHE'S ARRIVAL RUSHED
PELL MELL TOWARDS THE BARRICADE BUT BEFORE ENJOLRAS' ORDER COULD BE
EXECUTED THE DISCHARGE TOOK PLACE WITH THE TERRIFYING RATTLE OF A ROUND
OF GRAPE SHOT
THIS IS WHAT IT WAS IN FACT
THE CHARGE HAD BEEN AIMED AT THE CUT IN THE REDOUBT AND HAD THERE
REBOUNDED FROM THE WALL AND THIS TERRIBLE REBOUND HAD PRODUCED TWO DEAD
AND THREE WOUNDED
IF THIS WERE CONTINUED THE BARRICADE WAS NO LONGER TENABLE
THE
GRAPE SHOT MADE ITS WAY IN
A MURMUR OF CONSTERNATION AROSE
LET US PREVENT THE SECOND DISCHARGE SAID ENJOLRAS
AND LOWERING HIS RIFLE HE TOOK AIM AT THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUN WHO AT
THAT MOMENT WAS BEARING DOWN ON THE BREACH OF HIS GUN AND RECTIFYING
AND DEFINITELY FIXING ITS POINTING
THE CAPTAIN OF THE PIECE WAS A HANDSOME SERGEANT OF ARTILLERY VERY
YOUNG BLOND WITH A VERY GENTLE FACE AND THE INTELLIGENT AIR PECULIAR
TO THAT PREDESTINED AND REDOUBTABLE WEAPON WHICH BY DINT OF PERFECTING
ITSELF IN HORROR MUST END IN KILLING WAR
COMBEFERRE WHO WAS STANDING BESIDE ENJOLRAS SCRUTINIZED THIS YOUNG
MAN
WHAT A PITY SAID COMBEFERRE
WHAT HIDEOUS THINGS THESE BUTCHERIES
ARE COME WHEN THERE ARE NO MORE KINGS THERE WILL BE NO MORE WAR
ENJOLRAS YOU ARE TAKING AIM AT THAT SERGEANT YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT
HIM
FANCY HE IS A CHARMING YOUNG MAN HE IS INTREPID IT IS EVIDENT
THAT HE IS THOUGHTFUL THOSE YOUNG ARTILLERY MEN ARE VERY WELL EDUCATED
HE HAS A FATHER A MOTHER A FAMILY HE IS PROBABLY IN LOVE HE IS NOT
MORE THAN FIVE AND TWENTY AT THE MOST HE MIGHT BE YOUR BROTHER
HE IS SAID ENJOLRAS
YES REPLIED COMBEFERRE HE IS MINE TOO
WELL LET US NOT KILL HIM
LET ME ALONE
IT MUST BE DONE
AND A TEAR TRICKLED SLOWLY DOWN ENJOLRAS' MARBLE CHEEK
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE PRESSED THE TRIGGER OF HIS RIFLE
THE FLAME
LEAPED FORTH
THE ARTILLERY MAN TURNED ROUND TWICE HIS ARMS EXTENDED IN
FRONT OF HIM HIS HEAD UPLIFTED AS THOUGH FOR BREATH THEN HE FELL WITH
HIS SIDE ON THE GUN AND LAY THERE MOTIONLESS
THEY COULD SEE HIS BACK
FROM THE CENTRE OF WHICH THERE FLOWED DIRECTLY A STREAM OF BLOOD
THE
BALL HAD TRAVERSED HIS BREAST FROM SIDE TO SIDE
HE WAS DEAD
HE HAD TO BE CARRIED AWAY AND REPLACED BY ANOTHER
SEVERAL MINUTES WERE
THUS GAINED IN FACT
CHAPTER IX EMPLOYMENT OF THE OLD TALENTS OF A POACHER AND THAT
INFALLIBLE MARKSMANSHIP WHICH INFLUENCED THE CONDEMNATION OF 1796
OPINIONS WERE EXCHANGED IN THE BARRICADE
THE FIRING FROM THE GUN WAS
ABOUT TO BEGIN AGAIN
AGAINST THAT GRAPE SHOT THEY COULD NOT HOLD OUT
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LONGER
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DEADEN THE
BLOWS
ENJOLRAS ISSUED THIS COMMAND
WE MUST PLACE A MATTRESS THERE
WE HAVE NONE SAID COMBEFERRE THE WOUNDED ARE LYING ON THEM
JEAN VALJEAN WHO WAS SEATED APART ON A STONE POST AT THE CORNER OF THE
TAVERN WITH HIS GUN BETWEEN HIS KNEES HAD UP TO THAT MOMENT TAKEN
NO PART IN ANYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON
HE DID NOT APPEAR TO HEAR THE
COMBATANTS SAYING AROUND HIM HERE IS A GUN THAT IS DOING NOTHING
AT THE ORDER ISSUED BY ENJOLRAS HE ROSE
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE RABBLE IN THE RUE
DE LA CHANVRERIE AN OLD WOMAN FORESEEING THE BULLETS HAD PLACED HER
MATTRESS IN FRONT OF HER WINDOW
THIS WINDOW AN ATTIC WINDOW WAS ON
THE ROOF OF A SIX STORY HOUSE SITUATED A LITTLE BEYOND THE BARRICADE
THE MATTRESS PLACED CROSS WISE SUPPORTED AT THE BOTTOM ON TWO POLES
FOR DRYING LINEN WAS UPHELD AT THE TOP BY TWO ROPES WHICH AT THAT
DISTANCE LOOKED LIKE TWO THREADS AND WHICH WERE ATTACHED TO TWO NAILS
PLANTED IN THE WINDOW FRAMES
THESE ROPES WERE DISTINCTLY VISIBLE LIKE
HAIRS AGAINST THE SKY
CAN SOME ONE LEND ME A DOUBLE BARRELLED RIFLE SAID JEAN VALJEAN
ENJOLRAS WHO HAD JUST RE LOADED HIS HANDED IT TO HIM
JEAN VALJEAN TOOK AIM AT THE ATTIC WINDOW AND FIRED
ONE OF THE MATTRESS ROPES WAS CUT
THE MATTRESS NOW HUNG BY ONE THREAD ONLY
JEAN VALJEAN FIRED THE SECOND CHARGE
THE SECOND ROPE LASHED THE PANES
OF THE ATTIC WINDOW
THE MATTRESS SLIPPED BETWEEN THE TWO POLES AND FELL
INTO THE STREET
THE BARRICADE APPLAUDED
ALL VOICES CRIED
HERE IS A MATTRESS
YES SAID COMBEFERRE BUT WHO WILL GO AND FETCH IT
THE MATTRESS HAD IN FACT FALLEN OUTSIDE THE BARRICADE BETWEEN
BESIEGERS AND BESIEGED
NOW THE DEATH OF THE SERGEANT OF ARTILLERY
HAVING EXASPERATED THE TROOP THE SOLDIERS HAD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
BEEN LYING FLAT ON THEIR STOMACHS BEHIND THE LINE OF PAVING STONES WHICH
THEY HAD ERECTED AND IN ORDER TO SUPPLY THE FORCED SILENCE OF
THE PIECE WHICH WAS QUIET WHILE ITS SERVICE WAS IN COURSE OF
REORGANIZATION THEY HAD OPENED FIRE ON THE BARRICADE
THE INSURGENTS
DID NOT REPLY TO THIS MUSKETRY IN ORDER TO SPARE THEIR AMMUNITION THE
FUSILLADE BROKE AGAINST THE BARRICADE BUT THE STREET WHICH IT FILLED
WAS TERRIBLE
JEAN VALJEAN STEPPED OUT OF THE CUT ENTERED THE STREET TRAVERSED THE
STORM OF BULLETS WALKED UP TO THE MATTRESS HOISTED IT UPON HIS BACK
AND RETURNED TO THE BARRICADE
HE PLACED THE MATTRESS IN THE CUT WITH HIS OWN HANDS
HE FIXED IT THERE
AGAINST THE WALL IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE ARTILLERY MEN SHOULD NOT SEE
IT
THAT DONE THEY AWAITED THE NEXT DISCHARGE OF GRAPE SHOT
IT WAS NOT LONG IN COMING
THE CANNON VOMITED FORTH ITS PACKAGE OF BUCK SHOT WITH A ROAR
BUT THERE
WAS NO REBOUND
THE EFFECT WHICH THEY HAD FORESEEN HAD BEEN ATTAINED
THE BARRICADE WAS SAVED
CITIZEN SAID ENJOLRAS TO JEAN VALJEAN THE REPUBLIC THANKS YOU
BOSSUET ADMIRED AND LAUGHED
HE EXCLAIMED
IT IS IMMORAL THAT A MATTRESS SHOULD HAVE SO MUCH POWER
TRIUMPH OF
THAT WHICH YIELDS OVER THAT WHICH STRIKES WITH LIGHTNING
BUT NEVER
MIND GLORY TO THE MATTRESS WHICH ANNULS A CANNON
CHAPTER X DAWN
AT THAT MOMENT COSETTE AWOKE
HER CHAMBER WAS NARROW NEAT UNOBTRUSIVE WITH A LONG SASH WINDOW
FACING THE EAST ON THE BACK COURT YARD OF THE HOUSE
COSETTE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN PARIS
SHE HAD NOT BEEN
THERE ON THE PRECEDING EVENING AND SHE HAD ALREADY RETIRED TO HER
CHAMBER WHEN TOUSSAINT HAD SAID
IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS A ROW
COSETTE HAD SLEPT ONLY A FEW HOURS BUT SOUNDLY
SHE HAD HAD SWEET
DREAMS WHICH POSSIBLY AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT HER LITTLE BED WAS VERY
WHITE
SOME ONE WHO WAS MARIUS HAD APPEARED TO HER IN THE LIGHT
SHE
AWOKE WITH THE SUN IN HER EYES WHICH AT FIRST PRODUCED ON HER THE
EFFECT OF BEING A CONTINUATION OF HER DREAM
HER FIRST THOUGHT ON
EMERGING FROM THIS DREAM WAS A SMILING ONE
COSETTE FELT HERSELF
THOROUGHLY REASSURED
LIKE JEAN VALJEAN SHE HAD A FEW HOURS
PREVIOUSLY PASSED THROUGH THAT REACTION OF THE SOUL WHICH ABSOLUTELY
WILL NOT HEAR OF UNHAPPINESS
SHE BEGAN TO CHERISH HOPE WITH ALL HER
MIGHT WITHOUT KNOWING WHY
THEN SHE FELT A PANG AT HER HEART
IT WAS
THREE DAYS SINCE SHE HAD SEEN MARIUS
BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT HE
MUST HAVE RECEIVED HER LETTER THAT HE KNEW WHERE SHE WAS AND THAT
HE WAS SO CLEVER THAT HE WOULD FIND MEANS OF REACHING HER AND THAT
CERTAINLY TO DAY AND PERHAPS THAT VERY MORNING IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT
BUT THE RAYS OF LIGHT WERE VERY HORIZONTAL SHE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY
EARLY BUT THAT SHE MUST RISE NEVERTHELESS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE MARIUS
SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT MARIUS AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY
THAT WAS SUFFICIENT AND THAT MARIUS WOULD COME
NO OBJECTION WAS VALID
ALL THIS WAS CERTAIN
IT WAS MONSTROUS ENOUGH ALREADY TO HAVE SUFFERED
FOR THREE DAYS
MARIUS ABSENT THREE DAYS THIS WAS HORRIBLE ON THE PART
OF THE GOOD GOD
NOW THIS CRUEL TEASING FROM ON HIGH HAD BEEN GONE
THROUGH WITH
MARIUS WAS ABOUT TO ARRIVE AND HE WOULD BRING GOOD NEWS
YOUTH IS MADE THUS IT QUICKLY DRIES ITS EYES IT FINDS SORROW USELESS
AND DOES NOT ACCEPT IT
YOUTH IS THE SMILE OF THE FUTURE IN THE PRESENCE
OF AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY WHICH IS ITSELF
IT IS NATURAL TO IT TO BE
HAPPY
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ITS RESPIRATION WERE MADE OF HOPE
MOREOVER COSETTE COULD NOT REMEMBER WHAT MARIUS HAD SAID TO HER ON
THE SUBJECT OF THIS ABSENCE WHICH WAS TO LAST ONLY ONE DAY AND WHAT
EXPLANATION OF IT HE HAD GIVEN HER
EVERY ONE HAS NOTICED WITH WHAT
NIMBLENESS A COIN WHICH ONE HAS DROPPED ON THE GROUND ROLLS AWAY AND
HIDES AND WITH WHAT ART IT RENDERS ITSELF UNDISCOVERABLE
THERE ARE
THOUGHTS WHICH PLAY US THE SAME TRICK THEY NESTLE AWAY IN A CORNER OF
OUR BRAIN THAT IS THE END OF THEM THEY ARE LOST IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO
LAY THE MEMORY ON THEM
COSETTE WAS SOMEWHAT VEXED AT THE USELESS LITTLE
EFFORT MADE BY HER MEMORY
SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT IT WAS VERY NAUGHTY
AND VERY WICKED OF HER TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THE WORDS UTTERED BY MARIUS
SHE SPRANG OUT OF BED AND ACCOMPLISHED THE TWO ABLUTIONS OF SOUL AND
BODY HER PRAYERS AND HER TOILET
ONE MAY IN A CASE OF EXIGENCY INTRODUCE THE READER INTO A NUPTIAL
CHAMBER NOT INTO A VIRGINAL CHAMBER
VERSE WOULD HARDLY VENTURE IT
PROSE MUST NOT
IT IS THE INTERIOR OF A FLOWER THAT IS NOT YET UNFOLDED IT IS WHITENESS
IN THE DARK IT IS THE PRIVATE CELL OF A CLOSED LILY WHICH MUST NOT BE
GAZED UPON BY MAN SO LONG AS THE SUN HAS NOT GAZED UPON IT
WOMAN IN THE
BUD IS SACRED
THAT INNOCENT BUD WHICH OPENS THAT ADORABLE HALF NUDITY
WHICH IS AFRAID OF ITSELF THAT WHITE FOOT WHICH TAKES REFUGE IN A
SLIPPER THAT THROAT WHICH VEILS ITSELF BEFORE A MIRROR AS THOUGH
A MIRROR WERE AN EYE THAT CHEMISE WHICH MAKES HASTE TO RISE UP AND
CONCEAL THE SHOULDER FOR A CREAKING BIT OF FURNITURE OR A PASSING
VEHICLE THOSE CORDS TIED THOSE CLASPS FASTENED THOSE LACES DRAWN
THOSE TREMORS THOSE SHIVERS OF COLD AND MODESTY THAT EXQUISITE
AFFRIGHT IN EVERY MOVEMENT THAT ALMOST WINGED UNEASINESS WHERE THERE
IS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM THE SUCCESSIVE PHASES OF DRESSING AS CHARMING AS
THE CLOUDS OF DAWN IT IS NOT FITTING THAT ALL THIS SHOULD BE NARRATED
AND IT IS TOO MUCH TO HAVE EVEN CALLED ATTENTION TO IT
THE EYE OF MAN MUST BE MORE RELIGIOUS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE RISING OF A
YOUNG GIRL THAN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE RISING OF A STAR
THE POSSIBILITY
OF HURTING SHOULD INSPIRE AN AUGMENTATION OF RESPECT
THE DOWN ON THE
PEACH THE BLOOM ON THE PLUM THE RADIATED CRYSTAL OF THE SNOW THE WING
OF THE BUTTERFLY POWDERED WITH FEATHERS ARE COARSE COMPARED TO THAT
CHASTITY WHICH DOES NOT EVEN KNOW THAT IT IS CHASTE
THE YOUNG GIRL IS
ONLY THE FLASH OF A DREAM AND IS NOT YET A STATUE
HER BED CHAMBER IS
HIDDEN IN THE SOMBRE PART OF THE IDEAL
THE INDISCREET TOUCH OF A GLANCE
BRUTALIZES THIS VAGUE PENUMBRA
HERE CONTEMPLATION IS PROFANATION
WE SHALL THEREFORE SHOW NOTHING OF THAT SWEET LITTLE FLUTTER OF
COSETTE'S RISING
AN ORIENTAL TALE RELATES HOW THE ROSE WAS MADE WHITE BY GOD BUT THAT
ADAM LOOKED UPON HER WHEN SHE WAS UNFOLDING AND SHE WAS ASHAMED AND
TURNED CRIMSON
WE ARE OF THE NUMBER WHO FALL SPEECHLESS IN THE PRESENCE
OF YOUNG GIRLS AND FLOWERS SINCE WE THINK THEM WORTHY OF VENERATION
COSETTE DRESSED HERSELF VERY HASTILY COMBED AND DRESSED HER HAIR WHICH
WAS A VERY SIMPLE MATTER IN THOSE DAYS WHEN WOMEN DID NOT SWELL OUT
THEIR CURLS AND BANDS WITH CUSHIONS AND PUFFS AND DID NOT PUT CRINOLINE
IN THEIR LOCKS
THEN SHE OPENED THE WINDOW AND CAST HER EYES AROUND HER
IN EVERY DIRECTION HOPING TO DESCRY SOME BIT OF THE STREET AN ANGLE OF
THE HOUSE AN EDGE OF PAVEMENT SO THAT SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WATCH FOR
MARIUS THERE
BUT NO VIEW OF THE OUTSIDE WAS TO BE HAD
THE BACK COURT
WAS SURROUNDED BY TOLERABLY HIGH WALLS AND THE OUTLOOK WAS ONLY ON
SEVERAL GARDENS
COSETTE PRONOUNCED THESE GARDENS HIDEOUS FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN HER LIFE SHE FOUND FLOWERS UGLY
THE SMALLEST SCRAP OF THE
GUTTER OF THE STREET WOULD HAVE MET HER WISHES BETTER
SHE DECIDED TO
GAZE AT THE SKY AS THOUGH SHE THOUGHT THAT MARIUS MIGHT COME FROM THAT
QUARTER
ALL AT ONCE SHE BURST INTO TEARS
NOT THAT THIS WAS FICKLENESS OF
SOUL BUT HOPES CUT IN TWAIN BY DEJECTION THAT WAS HER CASE
SHE HAD A
CONFUSED CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOMETHING HORRIBLE
THOUGHTS WERE RIFE IN THE
AIR IN FACT
SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT SURE OF ANYTHING THAT
TO WITHDRAW HERSELF FROM SIGHT WAS TO BE LOST AND THE IDEA THAT MARIUS
COULD RETURN TO HER FROM HEAVEN APPEARED TO HER NO LONGER CHARMING BUT
MOURNFUL
THEN AS IS THE NATURE OF THESE CLOUDS CALM RETURNED TO HER AND HOPE
AND A SORT OF UNCONSCIOUS SMILE WHICH YET INDICATED TRUST IN GOD
EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE WAS STILL ASLEEP
A COUNTRY LIKE SILENCE REIGNED
NOT A SHUTTER HAD BEEN OPENED
THE PORTER'S LODGE WAS CLOSED
TOUSSAINT
HAD NOT RISEN AND COSETTE NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT HER FATHER WAS
ASLEEP
SHE MUST HAVE SUFFERED MUCH AND SHE MUST HAVE STILL BEEN
SUFFERING GREATLY FOR SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT HER FATHER HAD BEEN
UNKIND BUT SHE COUNTED ON MARIUS
THE ECLIPSE OF SUCH A LIGHT WAS
DECIDEDLY IMPOSSIBLE
NOW AND THEN SHE HEARD SHARP SHOCKS IN THE
DISTANCE AND SHE SAID IT IS ODD THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE OPENING AND
SHUTTING THEIR CARRIAGE GATES SO EARLY THEY WERE THE REPORTS OF THE
CANNON BATTERING THE BARRICADE
A FEW FEET BELOW COSETTE'S WINDOW IN THE ANCIENT AND PERFECTLY BLACK
CORNICE OF THE WALL THERE WAS A MARTIN'S NEST THE CURVE OF THIS NEST
FORMED A LITTLE PROJECTION BEYOND THE CORNICE SO THAT FROM ABOVE IT
WAS POSSIBLE TO LOOK INTO THIS LITTLE PARADISE
THE MOTHER WAS THERE
SPREADING HER WINGS LIKE A FAN OVER HER BROOD THE FATHER FLUTTERED
ABOUT FLEW AWAY THEN CAME BACK BEARING IN HIS BEAK FOOD AND KISSES
THE DAWNING DAY GILDED THIS HAPPY THING THE GREAT LAW MULTIPLY LAY
THERE SMILING AND AUGUST AND THAT SWEET MYSTERY UNFOLDED IN THE
GLORY OF THE MORNING
COSETTE WITH HER HAIR IN THE SUNLIGHT HER
SOUL ABSORBED IN CHIMERAS ILLUMINATED BY LOVE WITHIN AND BY THE DAWN
WITHOUT BENT OVER MECHANICALLY AND ALMOST WITHOUT DARING TO AVOW TO
HERSELF THAT SHE WAS THINKING AT THE SAME TIME OF MARIUS BEGAN TO GAZE
AT THESE BIRDS AT THIS FAMILY AT THAT MALE AND FEMALE THAT MOTHER AND
HER LITTLE ONES WITH THE PROFOUND TROUBLE WHICH A NEST PRODUCES ON A
VIRGIN
CHAPTER XI THE SHOT WHICH MISSES NOTHING AND KILLS NO ONE
THE ASSAILANTS' FIRE CONTINUED
MUSKETRY AND GRAPE SHOT ALTERNATED BUT
WITHOUT COMMITTING GREAT RAVAGES TO TELL THE TRUTH
THE TOP ALONE OF
THE CORINTHE FACADE SUFFERED THE WINDOW ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND THE
ATTIC WINDOW IN THE ROOF RIDDLED WITH BUCK SHOT AND BISCAIENS WERE
SLOWLY LOSING THEIR SHAPE
THE COMBATANTS WHO HAD BEEN POSTED THERE HAD
BEEN OBLIGED TO WITHDRAW
HOWEVER THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE TACTICS
OF BARRICADES TO FIRE FOR A LONG WHILE IN ORDER TO EXHAUST THE
INSURGENTS' AMMUNITION IF THEY COMMIT THE MISTAKE OF REPLYING
WHEN IT
IS PERCEIVED FROM THE SLACKENING OF THEIR FIRE THAT THEY HAVE NO MORE
POWDER AND BALL THE ASSAULT IS MADE
ENJOLRAS HAD NOT FALLEN INTO THIS
TRAP THE BARRICADE DID NOT REPLY
AT EVERY DISCHARGE BY PLATOONS GAVROCHE PUFFED OUT HIS CHEEK WITH HIS
TONGUE A SIGN OF SUPREME DISDAIN
GOOD FOR YOU SAID HE RIP UP THE CLOTH
WE WANT SOME LINT
COURFEYRAC CALLED THE GRAPE SHOT TO ORDER FOR THE LITTLE EFFECT WHICH IT
PRODUCED AND SAID TO THE CANNON
YOU ARE GROWING DIFFUSE MY GOOD FELLOW
ONE GETS PUZZLED IN BATTLE AS AT A BALL
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS
SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE REDOUBT BEGAN TO RENDER THE BESIEGERS UNEASY
AND TO MAKE THEM FEAR SOME UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND THAT THEY FELT THE
NECESSITY OF GETTING A CLEAR VIEW BEHIND THAT HEAP OF PAVING STONES AND
OF KNOWING WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND THAT IMPASSABLE WALL WHICH RECEIVED
BLOWS WITHOUT RETORTING
THE INSURGENTS SUDDENLY PERCEIVED A HELMET
GLITTERING IN THE SUN ON A NEIGHBORING ROOF
A FIREMAN HAD PLACED HIS
BACK AGAINST A TALL CHIMNEY AND SEEMED TO BE ACTING AS SENTINEL
HIS
GLANCE FELL DIRECTLY DOWN INTO THE BARRICADE
THERE'S AN EMBARRASSING WATCHER SAID ENJOLRAS
JEAN VALJEAN HAD RETURNED ENJOLRAS' RIFLE BUT HE HAD HIS OWN GUN
WITHOUT SAYING A WORD HE TOOK AIM AT THE FIREMAN AND A SECOND LATER
THE HELMET SMASHED BY A BULLET RATTLED NOISILY INTO THE STREET
THE
TERRIFIED SOLDIER MADE HASTE TO DISAPPEAR
A SECOND OBSERVER TOOK HIS
PLACE
THIS ONE WAS AN OFFICER
JEAN VALJEAN WHO HAD RE LOADED HIS
GUN TOOK AIM AT THE NEWCOMER AND SENT THE OFFICER'S CASQUE TO JOIN THE
SOLDIER'S
THE OFFICER DID NOT PERSIST AND RETIRED SPEEDILY
THIS TIME
THE WARNING WAS UNDERSTOOD
NO ONE MADE HIS APPEARANCE THEREAFTER ON
THAT ROOF AND THE IDEA OF SPYING ON THE BARRICADE WAS ABANDONED
WHY DID YOU NOT KILL THE MAN BOSSUET ASKED JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN MADE NO REPLY
CHAPTER XII DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER
BOSSUET MUTTERED IN COMBEFERRE'S EAR
HE DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION
HE IS A MAN WHO DOES GOOD BY GUN SHOTS SAID COMBEFERRE
THOSE WHO HAVE PRESERVED SOME MEMORY OF THIS ALREADY DISTANT EPOCH
KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM THE SUBURBS WAS VALIANT AGAINST
INSURRECTIONS
IT WAS PARTICULARLY ZEALOUS AND INTREPID IN THE DAYS OF
JUNE 1832
A CERTAIN GOOD DRAM SHOP KEEPER OF PANTIN DES VERTUS OR
LA CUNETTE WHOSE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CLOSED BY THE RIOTS BECAME
LEONINE AT THE SIGHT OF HIS DESERTED DANCE HALL AND GOT HIMSELF KILLED
TO PRESERVE THE ORDER REPRESENTED BY A TEA GARDEN
IN THAT BOURGEOIS AND
HEROIC TIME IN THE PRESENCE OF IDEAS WHICH HAD THEIR KNIGHTS INTERESTS
HAD THEIR PALADINS
THE PROSINESS OF THE ORIGINATORS DETRACTED NOTHING
FROM THE BRAVERY OF THE MOVEMENT
THE DIMINUTION OF A PILE OF CROWNS
MADE BANKERS SING THE MARSEILLAISE
THEY SHED THEIR BLOOD LYRICALLY FOR
THE COUNTING HOUSE AND THEY DEFENDED THE SHOP THAT IMMENSE DIMINUTIVE
OF THE FATHERLAND WITH LACEDAEMONIAN ENTHUSIASM
AT BOTTOM WE WILL OBSERVE THERE WAS NOTHING IN ALL THIS THAT WAS NOT
EXTREMELY SERIOUS
IT WAS SOCIAL ELEMENTS ENTERING INTO STRIFE WHILE
AWAITING THE DAY WHEN THEY SHOULD ENTER INTO EQUILIBRIUM
ANOTHER SIGN OF THE TIMES WAS THE ANARCHY MINGLED WITH GOVERNMENTALISM
THE BARBAROUS NAME OF THE CORRECT PARTY
PEOPLE WERE FOR ORDER IN
COMBINATION WITH LACK OF DISCIPLINE
THE DRUM SUDDENLY BEAT CAPRICIOUS CALLS AT THE COMMAND OF SUCH OR
SUCH A COLONEL OF THE NATIONAL GUARD SUCH AND SUCH A CAPTAIN WENT INTO
ACTION THROUGH INSPIRATION SUCH AND SUCH NATIONAL GUARDSMEN FOUGHT
FOR AN IDEA AND ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT
AT CRITICAL MOMENTS ON DAYS
THEY TOOK COUNSEL LESS OF THEIR LEADERS THAN OF THEIR INSTINCTS
THERE
EXISTED IN THE ARMY OF ORDER VERITABLE GUERILLEROS SOME OF THE SWORD
LIKE FANNICOT OTHERS OF THE PEN LIKE HENRI FONFREDE
CIVILIZATION UNFORTUNATELY REPRESENTED AT THIS EPOCH RATHER BY AN
AGGREGATION OF INTERESTS THAN BY A GROUP OF PRINCIPLES WAS OR THOUGHT
ITSELF IN PERIL IT SET UP THE CRY OF ALARM EACH CONSTITUTING HIMSELF
A CENTRE DEFENDED IT SUCCORED IT AND PROTECTED IT WITH HIS OWN HEAD
AND THE FIRST COMER TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO SAVE SOCIETY
ZEAL SOMETIMES PROCEEDED TO EXTERMINATION
A PLATOON OF THE NATIONAL
GUARD WOULD CONSTITUTE ITSELF ON ITS OWN AUTHORITY A PRIVATE COUNCIL OF
WAR AND JUDGE AND EXECUTE A CAPTURED INSURGENT IN FIVE MINUTES
IT
WAS AN IMPROVISATION OF THIS SORT THAT HAD SLAIN JEAN PROUVAIRE
FIERCE
LYNCH LAW WITH WHICH NO ONE PARTY HAD ANY RIGHT TO REPROACH THE REST
FOR IT HAS BEEN APPLIED BY THE REPUBLIC IN AMERICA AS WELL AS BY THE
MONARCHY IN EUROPE
THIS LYNCH LAW WAS COMPLICATED WITH MISTAKES
ON ONE
DAY OF RIOTING A YOUNG POET NAMED PAUL AIME GARNIER WAS PURSUED
IN THE PLACE ROYALE WITH A BAYONET AT HIS LOINS AND ONLY ESCAPED BY
TAKING REFUGE UNDER THE PORTE COCHERE OF NO
6
THEY SHOUTED THERE'S
ANOTHER OF THOSE SAINT SIMONIANS AND THEY WANTED TO KILL HIM
NOW HE
HAD UNDER HIS ARM A VOLUME OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE DUC DE SAINT SIMON
A NATIONAL GUARD HAD READ THE WORDS SAINT SIMON ON THE BOOK AND HAD
SHOUTED DEATH
ON THE 6TH OF JUNE 1832 A COMPANY OF THE NATIONAL GUARDS FROM THE
SUBURBS COMMANDED BY THE CAPTAIN FANNICOT ABOVE MENTIONED HAD ITSELF
DECIMATED IN THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE OUT OF CAPRICE AND ITS OWN GOOD
PLEASURE
THIS FACT SINGULAR THOUGH IT MAY SEEM WAS PROVED AT THE
JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION OPENED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INSURRECTION OF
1832
CAPTAIN FANNICOT A BOLD AND IMPATIENT BOURGEOIS A SORT OF
CONDOTTIERE OF THE ORDER OF THOSE WHOM WE HAVE JUST CHARACTERIZED
A FANATICAL AND INTRACTABLE GOVERNMENTALIST COULD NOT RESIST THE
TEMPTATION TO FIRE PREMATURELY AND THE AMBITION OF CAPTURING THE
BARRICADE ALONE AND UNAIDED THAT IS TO SAY WITH HIS COMPANY
EXASPERATED BY THE SUCCESSIVE APPARITION OF THE RED FLAG AND THE OLD
COAT WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE BLACK FLAG HE LOUDLY BLAMED THE GENERALS AND
CHIEFS OF THE CORPS WHO WERE HOLDING COUNCIL AND DID NOT THINK THAT THE
MOMENT FOR THE DECISIVE ASSAULT HAD ARRIVED AND WHO WERE ALLOWING THE
INSURRECTION TO FRY IN ITS OWN FAT TO USE THE CELEBRATED EXPRESSION
OF ONE OF THEM
FOR HIS PART HE THOUGHT THE BARRICADE RIPE AND AS THAT
WHICH IS RIPE OUGHT TO FALL HE MADE THE ATTEMPT
HE COMMANDED MEN AS RESOLUTE AS HIMSELF RAGING FELLOWS AS A WITNESS
SAID
HIS COMPANY THE SAME WHICH HAD SHOT JEAN PROUVAIRE THE POET WAS
THE FIRST OF THE BATTALION POSTED AT THE ANGLE OF THE STREET
AT THE
MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE LEAST EXPECTING IT THE CAPTAIN LAUNCHED HIS MEN
AGAINST THE BARRICADE
THIS MOVEMENT EXECUTED WITH MORE GOOD WILL THAN
STRATEGY COST THE FANNICOT COMPANY DEAR
BEFORE IT HAD TRAVERSED TWO
THIRDS OF THE STREET IT WAS RECEIVED BY A GENERAL DISCHARGE FROM THE
BARRICADE
FOUR THE MOST AUDACIOUS WHO WERE RUNNING ON IN FRONT
WERE MOWN DOWN POINT BLANK AT THE VERY FOOT OF THE REDOUBT AND THIS
COURAGEOUS THRONG OF NATIONAL GUARDS VERY BRAVE MEN BUT LACKING IN
MILITARY TENACITY WERE FORCED TO FALL BACK AFTER SOME HESITATION
LEAVING FIFTEEN CORPSES ON THE PAVEMENT
THIS MOMENTARY HESITATION GAVE
THE INSURGENTS TIME TO RE LOAD THEIR WEAPONS AND A SECOND AND VERY
DESTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE STRUCK THE COMPANY BEFORE IT COULD REGAIN THE
CORNER OF THE STREET ITS SHELTER
A MOMENT MORE AND IT WAS CAUGHT
BETWEEN TWO FIRES AND IT RECEIVED THE VOLLEY FROM THE BATTERY PIECE
WHICH NOT HAVING RECEIVED THE ORDER HAD NOT DISCONTINUED ITS FIRING
THE INTREPID AND IMPRUDENT FANNICOT WAS ONE OF THE DEAD FROM THIS
GRAPE SHOT
HE WAS KILLED BY THE CANNON THAT IS TO SAY BY ORDER
THIS ATTACK WHICH WAS MORE FURIOUS THAN SERIOUS IRRITATED
ENJOLRAS THE FOOLS SAID HE
THEY ARE GETTING THEIR OWN MEN KILLED
AND THEY ARE USING UP OUR AMMUNITION FOR NOTHING
ENJOLRAS SPOKE LIKE THE REAL GENERAL OF INSURRECTION WHICH HE
WAS
INSURRECTION AND REPRESSION DO NOT FIGHT WITH EQUAL WEAPONS
INSURRECTION WHICH IS SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED HAS ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER
OF SHOTS TO FIRE AND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF COMBATANTS TO EXPEND
AN EMPTY
CARTRIDGE BOX A MAN KILLED CANNOT BE REPLACED
AS REPRESSION HAS THE
ARMY IT DOES NOT COUNT ITS MEN AND AS IT HAS VINCENNES IT DOES NOT
COUNT ITS SHOTS
REPRESSION HAS AS MANY REGIMENTS AS THE BARRICADE HAS
MEN AND AS MANY ARSENALS AS THE BARRICADE HAS CARTRIDGE BOXES
THUS
THEY ARE STRUGGLES OF ONE AGAINST A HUNDRED WHICH ALWAYS END IN
CRUSHING THE BARRICADE UNLESS THE REVOLUTION UPRISING SUDDENLY
FLINGS INTO THE BALANCE ITS FLAMING ARCHANGEL'S SWORD
THIS DOES HAPPEN
SOMETIMES
THEN EVERYTHING RISES THE PAVEMENTS BEGIN TO SEETHE POPULAR
REDOUBTS ABOUND
PARIS QUIVERS SUPREMELY THE QUID DIVINUM IS GIVEN
FORTH A 10TH OF AUGUST IS IN THE AIR A 29TH OF JULY IS IN THE AIR A
WONDERFUL LIGHT APPEARS THE YAWNING MAW OF FORCE DRAWS BACK AND THE
ARMY THAT LION SEES BEFORE IT ERECT AND TRANQUIL THAT PROPHET
FRANCE
CHAPTER XIII PASSING GLEAMS
IN THE CHAOS OF SENTIMENTS AND PASSIONS WHICH DEFEND A BARRICADE THERE
IS A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING THERE IS BRAVERY THERE IS YOUTH HONOR
ENTHUSIASM THE IDEAL CONVICTION THE RAGE OF THE GAMBLER AND ABOVE
ALL INTERMITTENCES OF HOPE
ONE OF THESE INTERMITTENCES ONE OF THESE VAGUE QUIVERS OF HOPE SUDDENLY
TRAVERSED THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE AT THE MOMENT WHEN
IT WAS LEAST EXPECTED
LISTEN SUDDENLY CRIED ENJOLRAS WHO WAS STILL ON THE WATCH IT SEEMS
TO ME THAT PARIS IS WAKING UP
IT IS CERTAIN THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE 6TH OF JUNE THE INSURRECTION
BROKE OUT AFRESH FOR AN HOUR OR TWO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
THE OBSTINACY
OF THE ALARM PEAL OF SAINT MERRY REANIMATED SOME FANCIES
BARRICADES
WERE BEGUN IN THE RUE DU POIRIER AND THE RUE DES GRAVILLIERS
IN FRONT
OF THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN A YOUNG MAN ARMED WITH A RIFLE ATTACKED
ALONE A SQUADRON OF CAVALRY
IN PLAIN SIGHT ON THE OPEN BOULEVARD HE
PLACED ONE KNEE ON THE GROUND SHOULDERED HIS WEAPON FIRED KILLED THE
COMMANDER OF THE SQUADRON AND TURNED AWAY SAYING THERE'S ANOTHER WHO
WILL DO US NO MORE HARM
HE WAS PUT TO THE SWORD
IN THE RUE SAINT DENIS A WOMAN FIRED ON THE
NATIONAL GUARD FROM BEHIND A LOWERED BLIND
THE SLATS OF THE BLIND COULD
BE SEEN TO TREMBLE AT EVERY SHOT
A CHILD FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE
WAS ARRESTED IN THE RUE DE LA COSSONERIE WITH HIS POCKETS FULL OF
CARTRIDGES
MANY POSTS WERE ATTACKED
AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE
BERTIN POIREE A VERY LIVELY AND UTTERLY UNEXPECTED FUSILLADE WELCOMED
A REGIMENT OF CUIRRASSIERS AT WHOSE HEAD MARCHED MARSHAL GENERAL
CAVAIGNAC DE BARAGUE
IN THE RUE PLANCHE MIBRAY THEY THREW OLD PIECES
OF POTTERY AND HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS DOWN ON THE SOLDIERS FROM THE ROOFS A
BAD SIGN AND WHEN THIS MATTER WAS REPORTED TO MARSHAL SOULT NAPOLEON'S
OLD LIEUTENANT GREW THOUGHTFUL AS HE RECALLED SUCHET'S SAYING AT
SARAGOSSA WE ARE LOST WHEN THE OLD WOMEN EMPTY THEIR POTS DE CHAMBRE
ON OUR HEADS
THESE GENERAL SYMPTOMS WHICH PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE MOMENT WHEN
IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE UPRISING HAD BEEN RENDERED LOCAL THIS FEVER
OF WRATH THESE SPARKS WHICH FLEW HITHER AND THITHER ABOVE THOSE DEEP
MASSES OF COMBUSTIBLES WHICH ARE CALLED THE FAUBOURGS OF PARIS ALL
THIS TAKEN TOGETHER DISTURBED THE MILITARY CHIEFS
THEY MADE HASTE TO
STAMP OUT THESE BEGINNINGS OF CONFLAGRATION
THEY DELAYED THE ATTACK ON THE BARRICADES MAUBUEE DE LA CHANVRERIE AND
SAINT MERRY UNTIL THESE SPARKS HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED IN ORDER THAT THEY
MIGHT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BARRICADES ONLY AND BE ABLE TO FINISH
THEM AT ONE BLOW
COLUMNS WERE THROWN INTO THE STREETS WHERE THERE WAS
FERMENTATION SWEEPING THE LARGE SOUNDING THE SMALL RIGHT AND LEFT
NOW SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY NOW AT FULL CHARGE
THE TROOPS BROKE IN
THE DOORS OF HOUSES WHENCE SHOTS HAD BEEN FIRED AT THE SAME TIME
MANOEUVRES BY THE CAVALRY DISPERSED THE GROUPS ON THE BOULEVARDS
THIS
REPRESSION WAS NOT EFFECTED WITHOUT SOME COMMOTION AND WITHOUT THAT
TUMULTUOUS UPROAR PECULIAR TO COLLISIONS BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE
PEOPLE
THIS WAS WHAT ENJOLRAS HAD CAUGHT IN THE INTERVALS OF THE
CANNONADE AND THE MUSKETRY
MOREOVER HE HAD SEEN WOUNDED MEN PASSING
THE END OF THE STREET IN LITTERS AND HE SAID TO COURFEYRAC THOSE
WOUNDED DO NOT COME FROM US
THEIR HOPE DID NOT LAST LONG THE GLEAM WAS QUICKLY ECLIPSED
IN LESS
THAN HALF AN HOUR WHAT WAS IN THE AIR VANISHED IT WAS A FLASH OF
LIGHTNING UNACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER AND THE INSURGENTS FELT THAT SORT OF
LEADEN COPE WHICH THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE PEOPLE CASTS OVER OBSTINATE
AND DESERTED MEN FALL OVER THEM ONCE MORE
THE GENERAL MOVEMENT WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE ASSUMED A VAGUE OUTLINE HAD
MISCARRIED AND THE ATTENTION OF THE MINISTER OF WAR AND THE STRATEGY OF
THE GENERALS COULD NOW BE CONCENTRATED ON THE THREE OR FOUR BARRICADES
WHICH STILL REMAINED STANDING
THE SUN WAS MOUNTING ABOVE THE HORIZON
AN INSURGENT HAILED ENJOLRAS
WE ARE HUNGRY HERE
ARE WE REALLY GOING TO DIE LIKE THIS WITHOUT
ANYTHING TO EAT
ENJOLRAS WHO WAS STILL LEANING ON HIS ELBOWS AT HIS EMBRASURE MADE AN
AFFIRMATIVE SIGN WITH HIS HEAD BUT WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THE END
OF THE STREET
CHAPTER XIV WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS' MISTRESS
COURFEYRAC SEATED ON A PAVING STONE BESIDE ENJOLRAS CONTINUED TO
INSULT THE CANNON AND EACH TIME THAT THAT GLOOMY CLOUD OF PROJECTILES
WHICH IS CALLED GRAPE SHOT PASSED OVERHEAD WITH ITS TERRIBLE SOUND HE
ASSAILED IT WITH A BURST OF IRONY
YOU ARE WEARING OUT YOUR LUNGS POOR BRUTAL OLD FELLOW YOU PAIN ME
YOU ARE WASTING YOUR ROW
THAT'S NOT THUNDER IT'S A COUGH
AND THE BYSTANDERS LAUGHED
COURFEYRAC AND BOSSUET WHOSE BRAVE GOOD HUMOR INCREASED WITH THE PERIL
LIKE MADAME SCARRON REPLACED NOURISHMENT WITH PLEASANTRY AND AS WINE
WAS LACKING THEY POURED OUT GAYETY TO ALL
I ADMIRE ENJOLRAS SAID BOSSUET
HIS IMPASSIVE TEMERITY ASTOUNDS
ME
HE LIVES ALONE WHICH RENDERS HIM A LITTLE SAD PERHAPS ENJOLRAS
COMPLAINS OF HIS GREATNESS WHICH BINDS HIM TO WIDOWHOOD
THE REST OF US
HAVE MISTRESSES MORE OR LESS WHO MAKE US CRAZY THAT IS TO SAY BRAVE
WHEN A MAN IS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS A TIGER THE LEAST THAT HE CAN DO IS TO
FIGHT LIKE A LION
THAT IS ONE WAY OF TAKING OUR REVENGE FOR THE CAPERS
THAT MESDAMES OUR GRISETTES PLAY ON US
ROLAND GETS HIMSELF KILLED FOR
ANGELIQUE ALL OUR HEROISM COMES FROM OUR WOMEN
A MAN WITHOUT A WOMAN
IS A PISTOL WITHOUT A TRIGGER IT IS THE WOMAN THAT SETS THE MAN OFF
WELL ENJOLRAS HAS NO WOMAN
HE IS NOT IN LOVE AND YET HE MANAGES TO BE
INTREPID
IT IS A THING UNHEARD OF THAT A MAN SHOULD BE AS COLD AS ICE
AND AS BOLD AS FIRE
ENJOLRAS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE LISTENING BUT HAD ANY ONE BEEN NEAR HIM
THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM MUTTER IN A LOW VOICE PATRIA
BOSSUET WAS STILL LAUGHING WHEN COURFEYRAC EXCLAIMED
NEWS
AND ASSUMING THE TONE OF AN USHER MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT HE ADDED
MY NAME IS EIGHT POUNDER
IN FACT A NEW PERSONAGE HAD ENTERED ON THE SCENE
THIS WAS A SECOND
PIECE OF ORDNANCE
THE ARTILLERY MEN RAPIDLY PERFORMED THEIR MANOEUVRES IN FORCE AND PLACED
THIS SECOND PIECE IN LINE WITH THE FIRST
THIS OUTLINED THE CATASTROPHE
A FEW MINUTES LATER THE TWO PIECES RAPIDLY SERVED WERE FIRING
POINT BLANK AT THE REDOUBT THE PLATOON FIRING OF THE LINE AND OF THE
SOLDIERS FROM THE SUBURBS SUSTAINED THE ARTILLERY
ANOTHER CANNONADE WAS AUDIBLE AT SOME DISTANCE
AT THE SAME TIME THAT
THE TWO GUNS WERE FURIOUSLY ATTACKING THE REDOUBT FROM THE RUE DE LA
CHANVRERIE TWO OTHER CANNONS TRAINED ONE FROM THE RUE SAINT DENIS
THE OTHER FROM THE RUE AUBRY LE BOUCHER WERE RIDDLING THE SAINT MERRY
BARRICADE
THE FOUR CANNONS ECHOED EACH OTHER MOURNFULLY
THE BARKING OF THESE SOMBRE DOGS OF WAR REPLIED TO EACH OTHER
ONE OF THE TWO PIECES WHICH WAS NOW BATTERING THE BARRICADE ON THE RUE
DE LA CHANVRERIE WAS FIRING GRAPE SHOT THE OTHER BALLS
THE PIECE WHICH WAS FIRING BALLS WAS POINTED A LITTLE HIGH AND THE AIM
WAS CALCULATED SO THAT THE BALL STRUCK THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE UPPER
CREST OF THE BARRICADE AND CRUMBLED THE STONE DOWN UPON THE INSURGENTS
MINGLED WITH BURSTS OF GRAPE SHOT
THE OBJECT OF THIS MODE OF FIRING WAS TO DRIVE THE INSURGENTS FROM
THE SUMMIT OF THE REDOUBT AND TO COMPEL THEM TO GATHER CLOSE IN THE
INTERIOR THAT IS TO SAY THIS ANNOUNCED THE ASSAULT
THE COMBATANTS ONCE DRIVEN FROM THE CREST OF THE BARRICADE BY BALLS
AND FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE CABARET BY GRAPE SHOT THE ATTACKING COLUMNS
COULD VENTURE INTO THE STREET WITHOUT BEING PICKED OFF PERHAPS EVEN
WITHOUT BEING SEEN COULD BRISKLY AND SUDDENLY SCALE THE REDOUBT AS ON
THE PRECEDING EVENING AND WHO KNOWS TAKE IT BY SURPRISE
IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT THE INCONVENIENCE OF THOSE GUNS
SHOULD BE DIMINISHED SAID ENJOLRAS AND HE SHOUTED FIRE ON THE
ARTILLERY MEN
ALL WERE READY
THE BARRICADE WHICH HAD LONG BEEN SILENT POURED FORTH
A DESPERATE FIRE SEVEN OR EIGHT DISCHARGES FOLLOWED WITH A SORT OF
RAGE AND JOY THE STREET WAS FILLED WITH BLINDING SMOKE AND AT THE END
OF A FEW MINUTES ATHWART THIS MIST ALL STREAKED WITH FLAME TWO THIRDS
OF THE GUNNERS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED LYING BENEATH THE WHEELS OF THE
CANNONS
THOSE WHO WERE LEFT STANDING CONTINUED TO SERVE THE PIECES WITH
SEVERE TRANQUILLITY BUT THE FIRE HAD SLACKENED
THINGS ARE GOING WELL NOW SAID BOSSUET TO ENJOLRAS
SUCCESS
ENJOLRAS SHOOK HIS HEAD AND REPLIED
ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR OF THIS SUCCESS AND THERE WILL NOT BE ANY
CARTRIDGES LEFT IN THE BARRICADE
IT APPEARS THAT GAVROCHE OVERHEARD THIS REMARK
CHAPTER XV GAVROCHE OUTSIDE
COURFEYRAC SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOME ONE AT THE BASE OF THE
BARRICADE OUTSIDE IN THE STREET AMID THE BULLETS
GAVROCHE HAD TAKEN A BOTTLE BASKET FROM THE WINE SHOP HAD MADE HIS
WAY OUT THROUGH THE CUT AND WAS QUIETLY ENGAGED IN EMPTYING THE FULL
CARTRIDGE BOXES OF THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN WHO HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE
SLOPE OF THE REDOUBT INTO HIS BASKET
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE ASKED COURFEYRAC
GAVROCHE RAISED HIS FACE
I'M FILLING MY BASKET CITIZEN
DON'T YOU SEE THE GRAPE SHOT
GAVROCHE REPLIED
WELL IT IS RAINING
WHAT THEN
COURFEYRAC SHOUTED COME IN
INSTANTER SAID GAVROCHE
AND WITH A SINGLE BOUND HE PLUNGED INTO THE STREET
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT FANNICOT'S COMPANY HAD LEFT BEHIND IT A TRAIL
OF BODIES
TWENTY CORPSES LAY SCATTERED HERE AND THERE ON THE PAVEMENT
THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STREET
TWENTY CARTOUCHES FOR GAVROCHE
MEANT A PROVISION OF CARTRIDGES FOR THE BARRICADE
THE SMOKE IN THE STREET WAS LIKE A FOG
WHOEVER HAS BEHELD A CLOUD WHICH
HAS FALLEN INTO A MOUNTAIN GORGE BETWEEN TWO PEAKED ESCARPMENTS CAN
IMAGINE THIS SMOKE RENDERED DENSER AND THICKER BY TWO GLOOMY ROWS OF
LOFTY HOUSES
IT ROSE GRADUALLY AND WAS INCESSANTLY RENEWED HENCE A
TWILIGHT WHICH MADE EVEN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT TURN PALE
THE COMBATANTS
COULD HARDLY SEE EACH OTHER FROM ONE END OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER
SHORT AS IT WAS
THIS OBSCURITY WHICH HAD PROBABLY BEEN DESIRED AND CALCULATED ON BY THE
COMMANDERS WHO WERE TO DIRECT THE ASSAULT ON THE BARRICADE WAS USEFUL
TO GAVROCHE
BENEATH THE FOLDS OF THIS VEIL OF SMOKE AND THANKS TO HIS SMALL SIZE
HE COULD ADVANCE TOLERABLY FAR INTO THE STREET WITHOUT BEING SEEN
HE
RIFLED THE FIRST SEVEN OR EIGHT CARTRIDGE BOXES WITHOUT MUCH DANGER
HE CRAWLED FLAT ON HIS BELLY GALLOPED ON ALL FOURS TOOK HIS BASKET
IN HIS TEETH TWISTED GLIDED UNDULATED WOUND FROM ONE DEAD BODY TO
ANOTHER AND EMPTIED THE CARTRIDGE BOX OR CARTOUCHE AS A MONKEY OPENS A
NUT
THEY DID NOT DARE TO SHOUT TO HIM TO RETURN FROM THE BARRICADE WHICH
WAS QUITE NEAR FOR FEAR OF ATTRACTING ATTENTION TO HIM
ON ONE BODY THAT OF A CORPORAL HE FOUND A POWDER FLASK
FOR THIRST SAID HE PUTTING IT IN HIS POCKET
BY DINT OF ADVANCING HE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE FOG OF THE FUSILLADE
BECAME TRANSPARENT
SO THAT THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE LINE RANGED ON
THE OUTLOOK BEHIND THEIR PAVING STONE DIKE AND THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE
BANLIEUE MASSED AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET SUDDENLY POINTED OUT TO EACH
OTHER SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH THE SMOKE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN GAVROCHE WAS RELIEVING A SERGEANT WHO WAS LYING NEAR
A STONE DOOR POST OF HIS CARTRIDGES A BULLET STRUCK THE BODY
FICHTRE EJACULATED GAVROCHE
THEY ARE KILLING MY DEAD MEN FOR ME
A SECOND BULLET STRUCK A SPARK FROM THE PAVEMENT BESIDE HIM A THIRD
OVERTURNED HIS BASKET
GAVROCHE LOOKED AND SAW THAT THIS CAME FROM THE MEN OF THE BANLIEUE
HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET STOOD ERECT WITH HIS HAIR FLYING IN THE WIND
HIS HANDS ON HIS HIPS HIS EYES FIXED ON THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN WHO WERE
FIRING AND SANG
ON EST LAID A NANTERRE MEN ARE UGLY AT NANTERRE
C'EST LA FAUTE A VOLTAIRE 'TIS THE FAULT OF VOLTAIRE
ET BETE A PALAISEAU AND DULL AT PALAISEAU
C'EST LA FAUTE A ROUSSEAU 'TIS THE FAULT OF ROUSSEAU
THEN HE PICKED UP HIS BASKET REPLACED THE CARTRIDGES WHICH HAD FALLEN
FROM IT WITHOUT MISSING A SINGLE ONE AND ADVANCING TOWARDS THE
FUSILLADE SET ABOUT PLUNDERING ANOTHER CARTRIDGE BOX
THERE A FOURTH
BULLET MISSED HIM AGAIN
GAVROCHE SANG
JE NE SUIS PAS NOTAIRE I AM NOT A NOTARY
C'EST LA FAUTE A VOLTAIRE 'TIS THE FAULT OF VOLTAIRE
JE SUIS UN PETIT OISEAU I'M A LITTLE BIRD
C'EST LA FAUTE A ROUSSEAU 'TIS THE FAULT OF ROUSSEAU
A FIFTH BULLET ONLY SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING FROM HIM A THIRD COUPLET
JOIE EST MON CARACTERE JOY IS MY CHARACTER
C'EST LA FAUTE A VOLTAIRE 'TIS THE FAULT OF VOLTAIRE
MISERE EST MON TROUSSEAU MISERY IS MY TROUSSEAU
C'EST LA FAUTE A ROUSSEAU 'TIS THE FAULT OF ROUSSEAU
THUS IT WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
IT WAS A CHARMING AND TERRIBLE SIGHT
GAVROCHE THOUGH SHOT AT WAS
TEASING THE FUSILLADE
HE HAD THE AIR OF BEING GREATLY DIVERTED
IT WAS
THE SPARROW PECKING AT THE SPORTSMEN
TO EACH DISCHARGE HE RETORTED
WITH A COUPLET
THEY AIMED AT HIM CONSTANTLY AND ALWAYS MISSED HIM
THE
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND THE SOLDIERS LAUGHED AS THEY TOOK AIM AT HIM
HE
LAY DOWN SPRANG TO HIS FEET HID IN THE CORNER OF A DOORWAY THEN MADE
A BOUND DISAPPEARED RE APPEARED SCAMPERED AWAY RETURNED REPLIED TO
THE GRAPE SHOT WITH HIS THUMB AT HIS NOSE AND ALL THE WHILE WENT ON
PILLAGING THE CARTOUCHES EMPTYING THE CARTRIDGE BOXES AND FILLING HIS
BASKET
THE INSURGENTS PANTING WITH ANXIETY FOLLOWED HIM WITH THEIR
EYES
THE BARRICADE TREMBLED HE SANG
HE WAS NOT A CHILD HE WAS NOT
A MAN HE WAS A STRANGE GAMIN FAIRY
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED THE
INVULNERABLE DWARF OF THE FRAY
THE BULLETS FLEW AFTER HIM HE WAS MORE
NIMBLE THAN THEY
HE PLAYED A FEARFUL GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK WITH DEATH
EVERY TIME THAT THE FLAT NOSED FACE OF THE SPECTRE APPROACHED THE
URCHIN ADMINISTERED TO IT A FILLIP
ONE BULLET HOWEVER BETTER AIMED OR MORE TREACHEROUS THAN THE REST
FINALLY STRUCK THE WILL O' THE WISP OF A CHILD
GAVROCHE WAS SEEN TO
STAGGER THEN HE SANK TO THE EARTH
THE WHOLE BARRICADE GAVE VENT TO A
CRY BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF ANTAEUS IN THAT PYGMY FOR THE GAMIN
TO TOUCH THE PAVEMENT IS THE SAME AS FOR THE GIANT TO TOUCH THE EARTH
GAVROCHE HAD FALLEN ONLY TO RISE AGAIN HE REMAINED IN A SITTING
POSTURE A LONG THREAD OF BLOOD STREAKED HIS FACE HE RAISED BOTH ARMS
IN THE AIR GLANCED IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE THE SHOT HAD COME AND BEGAN
TO SING
JE SUIS TOMBE PAR TERRE I HAVE FALLEN TO THE EARTH
C'EST LA FAUTE A VOLTAIRE 'TIS THE FAULT OF VOLTAIRE
LE NEZ DANS LE RUISSEAU WITH MY NOSE IN THE GUTTER
C'EST LA FAUTE A
'TIS THE FAULT OF
HE DID NOT FINISH
A SECOND BULLET FROM THE SAME MARKSMAN STOPPED HIM
SHORT
THIS TIME HE FELL FACE DOWNWARD ON THE PAVEMENT AND MOVED NO
MORE
THIS GRAND LITTLE SOUL HAD TAKEN ITS FLIGHT
CHAPTER XVI HOW FROM A BROTHER ONE BECOMES A FATHER
AT THAT SAME MOMENT IN THE GARDEN OF THE LUXEMBOURG FOR THE GAZE OF
THE DRAMA MUST BE EVERYWHERE PRESENT TWO CHILDREN WERE HOLDING EACH
OTHER BY THE HAND
ONE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEVEN YEARS OLD THE OTHER FIVE
THE RAIN HAVING SOAKED THEM THEY WERE WALKING ALONG THE PATHS ON
THE SUNNY SIDE THE ELDER WAS LEADING THE YOUNGER THEY WERE PALE AND
RAGGED THEY HAD THE AIR OF WILD BIRDS
THE SMALLER OF THEM SAID I AM
VERY HUNGRY
THE ELDER WHO WAS ALREADY SOMEWHAT OF A PROTECTOR WAS LEADING HIS
BROTHER WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND IN HIS RIGHT HE CARRIED A SMALL STICK
THEY WERE ALONE IN THE GARDEN
THE GARDEN WAS DESERTED THE GATES HAD
BEEN CLOSED BY ORDER OF THE POLICE ON ACCOUNT OF THE INSURRECTION
THE
TROOPS WHO HAD BEEN BIVOUACKING THERE HAD DEPARTED FOR THE EXIGENCIES OF
COMBAT
HOW DID THOSE CHILDREN COME THERE PERHAPS THEY HAD ESCAPED FROM SOME
GUARD HOUSE WHICH STOOD AJAR PERHAPS THERE WAS IN THE VICINITY AT
THE BARRIERE D'ENFER OR ON THE ESPLANADE DE L'OBSERVATOIRE OR IN THE
NEIGHBORING CARREFOUR DOMINATED BY THE PEDIMENT ON WHICH COULD BE READ
INVENERUNT PARVULUM PANNIS INVOLUTUM SOME MOUNTEBANK'S BOOTH FROM WHICH
THEY HAD FLED PERHAPS THEY HAD ON THE PRECEDING EVENING ESCAPED THE
EYE OF THE INSPECTORS OF THE GARDEN AT THE HOUR OF CLOSING AND HAD
PASSED THE NIGHT IN SOME ONE OF THOSE SENTRY BOXES WHERE PEOPLE READ THE
PAPERS THE FACT IS THEY WERE STRAY LAMBS AND THEY SEEMED FREE
TO BE
ASTRAY AND TO SEEM FREE IS TO BE LOST
THESE POOR LITTLE CREATURES WERE
IN FACT LOST
THESE TWO CHILDREN WERE THE SAME OVER WHOM GAVROCHE HAD BEEN PUT TO
SOME TROUBLE AS THE READER WILL RECOLLECT
CHILDREN OF THE THENARDIERS
LEASED OUT TO MAGNON ATTRIBUTED TO M
GILLENORMAND AND NOW LEAVES
FALLEN FROM ALL THESE ROOTLESS BRANCHES AND SWEPT OVER THE GROUND BY
THE WIND
THEIR CLOTHING WHICH HAD BEEN CLEAN IN MAGNON'S DAY AND
WHICH HAD SERVED HER AS A PROSPECTUS WITH M
GILLENORMAND HAD BEEN
CONVERTED INTO RAGS
HENCEFORTH THESE BEINGS BELONGED TO THE STATISTICS AS ABANDONED
CHILDREN WHOM THE POLICE TAKE NOTE OF COLLECT MISLAY AND FIND AGAIN
ON THE PAVEMENTS OF PARIS
IT REQUIRED THE DISTURBANCE OF A DAY LIKE THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE
MISERABLE LITTLE CREATURES BEING IN THAT GARDEN
IF THE SUPERINTENDENTS
HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THEM THEY WOULD HAVE DRIVEN SUCH RAGS FORTH
POOR
LITTLE THINGS DO NOT ENTER PUBLIC GARDENS STILL PEOPLE SHOULD REFLECT
THAT AS CHILDREN THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO FLOWERS
THESE CHILDREN WERE THERE THANKS TO THE LOCKED GATES
THEY WERE THERE
CONTRARY TO THE REGULATIONS
THEY HAD SLIPPED INTO THE GARDEN AND THERE
THEY REMAINED
CLOSED GATES DO NOT DISMISS THE INSPECTORS OVERSIGHT
IS SUPPOSED TO CONTINUE BUT IT GROWS SLACK AND REPOSES AND THE
INSPECTORS MOVED BY THE PUBLIC ANXIETY AND MORE OCCUPIED WITH THE
OUTSIDE THAN THE INSIDE NO LONGER GLANCED INTO THE GARDEN AND HAD NOT
SEEN THE TWO DELINQUENTS
IT HAD RAINED THE NIGHT BEFORE AND EVEN A LITTLE IN THE MORNING
BUT
IN JUNE SHOWERS DO NOT COUNT FOR MUCH
AN HOUR AFTER A STORM IT CAN
HARDLY BE SEEN THAT THE BEAUTIFUL BLONDE DAY HAS WEPT
THE EARTH IN
SUMMER IS AS QUICKLY DRIED AS THE CHEEK OF A CHILD
AT THAT PERIOD OF
THE SOLSTICE THE LIGHT OF FULL NOONDAY IS SO TO SPEAK POIGNANT
IT
TAKES EVERYTHING
IT APPLIES ITSELF TO THE EARTH AND SUPERPOSES ITSELF
WITH A SORT OF SUCTION
ONE WOULD SAY THAT THE SUN WAS THIRSTY
A SHOWER
IS BUT A GLASS OF WATER A RAINSTORM IS INSTANTLY DRUNK UP
IN THE
MORNING EVERYTHING WAS DRIPPING IN THE AFTERNOON EVERYTHING IS POWDERED
OVER
NOTHING IS SO WORTHY OF ADMIRATION AS FOLIAGE WASHED BY THE RAIN AND
WIPED BY THE RAYS OF SUNLIGHT IT IS WARM FRESHNESS
THE GARDENS AND
MEADOWS HAVING WATER AT THEIR ROOTS AND SUN IN THEIR FLOWERS BECOME
PERFUMING PANS OF INCENSE AND SMOKE WITH ALL THEIR ODORS AT
ONCE
EVERYTHING SMILES SINGS AND OFFERS ITSELF
ONE FEELS GENTLY
INTOXICATED
THE SPRINGTIME IS A PROVISIONAL PARADISE THE SUN HELPS MAN
TO HAVE PATIENCE
THERE ARE BEINGS WHO DEMAND NOTHING FURTHER MORTALS WHO HAVING
THE AZURE OF HEAVEN SAY IT IS ENOUGH DREAMERS ABSORBED IN THE
WONDERFUL DIPPING INTO THE IDOLATRY OF NATURE INDIFFERENT TO GOOD AND
EVIL CONTEMPLATORS OF COSMOS AND RADIANTLY FORGETFUL OF MAN WHO DO NOT
UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE CAN OCCUPY THEMSELVES WITH THE HUNGER OF THESE
AND THE THIRST OF THOSE WITH THE NUDITY OF THE POOR IN WINTER WITH THE
LYMPHATIC CURVATURE OF THE LITTLE SPINAL COLUMN WITH THE PALLET THE
ATTIC THE DUNGEON AND THE RAGS OF SHIVERING YOUNG GIRLS WHEN THEY
CAN DREAM BENEATH THE TREES PEACEFUL AND TERRIBLE SPIRITS THEY AND
PITILESSLY SATISFIED
STRANGE TO SAY THE INFINITE SUFFICES THEM
THAT
GREAT NEED OF MAN THE FINITE WHICH ADMITS OF EMBRACE THEY IGNORE
THE FINITE WHICH ADMITS OF PROGRESS AND SUBLIME TOIL THEY DO NOT
THINK ABOUT
THE INDEFINITE WHICH IS BORN FROM THE HUMAN AND DIVINE
COMBINATION OF THE INFINITE AND THE FINITE ESCAPES THEM
PROVIDED THAT
THEY ARE FACE TO FACE WITH IMMENSITY THEY SMILE
JOY NEVER ECSTASY
FOREVER
THEIR LIFE LIES IN SURRENDERING THEIR PERSONALITY IN
CONTEMPLATION
THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY IS FOR THEM ONLY A DETAILED
PLAN
ALL IS NOT THERE THE TRUE ALL REMAINS WITHOUT WHAT IS THE USE
OF BUSYING ONESELF OVER THAT DETAIL MAN MAN SUFFERS THAT IS QUITE
POSSIBLE BUT LOOK AT ALDEBARAN RISING THE MOTHER HAS NO MORE MILK THE
NEW BORN BABE IS DYING
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT BUT JUST LOOK AT THIS
WONDERFUL ROSETTE WHICH A SLICE OF WOOD CELLS OF THE PINE PRESENTS UNDER
THE MICROSCOPE COMPARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MECHLIN LACE TO THAT IF YOU
CAN THESE THINKERS FORGET TO LOVE
THE ZODIAC THRIVES WITH THEM TO SUCH
A POINT THAT IT PREVENTS THEIR SEEING THE WEEPING CHILD
GOD ECLIPSES
THEIR SOULS
THIS IS A FAMILY OF MINDS WHICH ARE AT ONCE GREAT AND
PETTY
HORACE WAS ONE OF THEM SO WAS GOETHE
LA FONTAINE PERHAPS
MAGNIFICENT EGOISTS OF THE INFINITE TRANQUIL SPECTATORS OF SORROW WHO
DO NOT BEHOLD NERO IF THE WEATHER BE FAIR FOR WHOM THE SUN CONCEALS THE
FUNERAL PILE WHO WOULD LOOK ON AT AN EXECUTION BY THE GUILLOTINE IN THE
SEARCH FOR AN EFFECT OF LIGHT WHO HEAR NEITHER THE CRY NOR THE SOB NOR
THE DEATH RATTLE NOR THE ALARM PEAL FOR WHOM EVERYTHING IS WELL SINCE
THERE IS A MONTH OF MAY WHO SO LONG AS THERE ARE CLOUDS OF PURPLE
AND GOLD ABOVE THEIR HEADS DECLARE THEMSELVES CONTENT AND WHO ARE
DETERMINED TO BE HAPPY UNTIL THE RADIANCE OF THE STARS AND THE SONGS OF
THE BIRDS ARE EXHAUSTED
THESE ARE DARK RADIANCES
THEY HAVE NO SUSPICION THAT THEY ARE TO BE
PITIED
CERTAINLY THEY ARE SO
HE WHO DOES NOT WEEP DOES NOT SEE
THEY
ARE TO BE ADMIRED AND PITIED AS ONE WOULD BOTH PITY AND ADMIRE A BEING
AT ONCE NIGHT AND DAY WITHOUT EYES BENEATH HIS LASHES BUT WITH A STAR
ON HIS BROW
THE INDIFFERENCE OF THESE THINKERS IS ACCORDING TO SOME A SUPERIOR
PHILOSOPHY
THAT MAY BE BUT IN THIS SUPERIORITY THERE IS SOME
INFIRMITY
ONE MAY BE IMMORTAL AND YET LIMP WITNESS VULCAN
ONE MAY
BE MORE THAN MAN AND LESS THAN MAN
THERE IS INCOMPLETE IMMENSITY IN
NATURE
WHO KNOWS WHETHER THE SUN IS NOT A BLIND MAN
BUT THEN WHAT IN WHOM CAN WE TRUST SOLEM QUIS DICERE FALSUM AUDEAT
WHO SHALL DARE TO SAY THAT THE SUN IS FALSE THUS CERTAIN GENIUSES
THEMSELVES CERTAIN VERY LOFTY MORTALS MAN STARS MAY BE MISTAKEN THAT
WHICH IS ON HIGH AT THE SUMMIT AT THE CREST AT THE ZENITH THAT WHICH
SENDS DOWN SO MUCH LIGHT ON THE EARTH SEES BUT LITTLE SEES BADLY SEES
NOT AT ALL IS NOT THIS A DESPERATE STATE OF THINGS NO
BUT WHAT IS
THERE THEN ABOVE THE SUN THE GOD
ON THE 6TH OF JUNE 1832 ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE
LUXEMBOURG SOLITARY AND DEPOPULATED WAS CHARMING
THE QUINCUNXES AND
FLOWER BEDS SHED FORTH BALM AND DAZZLING BEAUTY INTO THE SUNLIGHT
THE
BRANCHES WILD WITH THE BRILLIANT GLOW OF MIDDAY SEEMED ENDEAVORING
TO EMBRACE
IN THE SYCAMORES THERE WAS AN UPROAR OF LINNETS SPARROWS
TRIUMPHED WOODPECKERS CLIMBED ALONG THE CHESTNUT TREES ADMINISTERING
LITTLE PECKS ON THE BARK
THE FLOWER BEDS ACCEPTED THE LEGITIMATE
ROYALTY OF THE LILIES THE MOST AUGUST OF PERFUMES IS THAT WHICH
EMANATES FROM WHITENESS
THE PEPPERY ODOR OF THE CARNATIONS WAS
PERCEPTIBLE
THE OLD CROWS OF MARIE DE MEDICI WERE AMOROUS IN THE TALL
TREES
THE SUN GILDED EMPURPLED SET FIRE TO AND LIGHTED UP THE TULIPS
WHICH ARE NOTHING BUT ALL THE VARIETIES OF FLAME MADE INTO FLOWERS
ALL
AROUND THE BANKS OF TULIPS THE BEES THE SPARKS OF THESE FLAME FLOWERS
HUMMED
ALL WAS GRACE AND GAYETY EVEN THE IMPENDING RAIN THIS RELAPSE
BY WHICH THE LILIES OF THE VALLEY AND THE HONEYSUCKLES WERE DESTINED TO
PROFIT HAD NOTHING DISTURBING ABOUT IT THE SWALLOWS INDULGED IN THE
CHARMING THREAT OF FLYING LOW
HE WHO WAS THERE ASPIRED TO HAPPINESS
LIFE SMELLED GOOD ALL NATURE EXHALED CANDOR HELP ASSISTANCE
PATERNITY CARESS DAWN
THE THOUGHTS WHICH FELL FROM HEAVEN WERE AS
SWEET AS THE TINY HAND OF A BABY WHEN ONE KISSES IT
THE STATUES UNDER THE TREES WHITE AND NUDE HAD ROBES OF SHADOW PIERCED
WITH LIGHT THESE GODDESSES WERE ALL TATTERED WITH SUNLIGHT RAYS HUNG
FROM THEM ON ALL SIDES
AROUND THE GREAT FOUNTAIN THE EARTH WAS ALREADY
DRIED UP TO THE POINT OF BEING BURNT
THERE WAS SUFFICIENT BREEZE TO
RAISE LITTLE INSURRECTIONS OF DUST HERE AND THERE
A FEW YELLOW LEAVES
LEFT OVER FROM THE AUTUMN CHASED EACH OTHER MERRILY AND SEEMED TO BE
PLAYING TRICKS ON EACH OTHER
THIS ABUNDANCE OF LIGHT HAD SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY REASSURING ABOUT IT
LIFE SAP HEAT ODORS OVERFLOWED ONE WAS CONSCIOUS BENEATH CREATION
OF THE ENORMOUS SIZE OF THE SOURCE IN ALL THESE BREATHS PERMEATED WITH
LOVE IN THIS INTERCHANGE OF REVERBERATIONS AND REFLECTIONS IN THIS
MARVELLOUS EXPENDITURE OF RAYS IN THIS INFINITE OUTPOURING OF LIQUID
GOLD ONE FELT THE PRODIGALITY OF THE INEXHAUSTIBLE AND BEHIND THIS
SPLENDOR AS BEHIND A CURTAIN OF FLAME ONE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF GOD THAT
MILLIONAIRE OF STARS
THANKS TO THE SAND THERE WAS NOT A SPECK OF MUD THANKS TO THE RAIN
THERE WAS NOT A GRAIN OF ASHES
THE CLUMPS OF BLOSSOMS HAD JUST BEEN
BATHED EVERY SORT OF VELVET SATIN GOLD AND VARNISH WHICH SPRINGS
FROM THE EARTH IN THE FORM OF FLOWERS WAS IRREPROACHABLE
THIS
MAGNIFICENCE WAS CLEANLY
THE GRAND SILENCE OF HAPPY NATURE FILLED THE
GARDEN
A CELESTIAL SILENCE THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH A THOUSAND SORTS OF
MUSIC THE COOING OF NESTS THE BUZZING OF SWARMS THE FLUTTERINGS OF
THE BREEZE
ALL THE HARMONY OF THE SEASON WAS COMPLETE IN ONE GRACIOUS
WHOLE THE ENTRANCES AND EXITS OF SPRING TOOK PLACE IN PROPER ORDER THE
LILACS ENDED THE JASMINES BEGAN SOME FLOWERS WERE TARDY SOME INSECTS
IN ADVANCE OF THEIR TIME THE VAN GUARD OF THE RED JUNE BUTTERFLIES
FRATERNIZED WITH THE REAR GUARD OF THE WHITE BUTTERFLIES OF MAY
THE
PLANTAIN TREES WERE GETTING THEIR NEW SKINS
THE BREEZE HOLLOWED OUT
UNDULATIONS IN THE MAGNIFICENT ENORMITY OF THE CHESTNUT TREES
IT
WAS SPLENDID
A VETERAN FROM THE NEIGHBORING BARRACKS WHO WAS GAZING
THROUGH THE FENCE SAID HERE IS THE SPRING PRESENTING ARMS AND IN FULL
UNIFORM
ALL NATURE WAS BREAKFASTING CREATION WAS AT TABLE THIS WAS ITS HOUR
THE GREAT BLUE CLOTH WAS SPREAD IN THE SKY AND THE GREAT GREEN CLOTH
ON EARTH THE SUN LIGHTED IT ALL UP BRILLIANTLY
GOD WAS SERVING
THE UNIVERSAL REPAST
EACH CREATURE HAD HIS PASTURE OR HIS MESS
THE
RING DOVE FOUND HIS HEMP SEED THE CHAFFINCH FOUND HIS MILLET THE
GOLDFINCH FOUND CHICKWEED THE RED BREAST FOUND WORMS THE GREEN FINCH
FOUND FLIES THE FLY FOUND INFUSORIAE THE BEE FOUND FLOWERS
THEY ATE
EACH OTHER SOMEWHAT IT IS TRUE WHICH IS THE MISERY OF EVIL MIXED WITH
GOOD BUT NOT A BEAST OF THEM ALL HAD AN EMPTY STOMACH
THE TWO LITTLE ABANDONED CREATURES HAD ARRIVED IN THE VICINITY OF THE
GRAND FOUNTAIN AND RATHER BEWILDERED BY ALL THIS LIGHT THEY TRIED TO
HIDE THEMSELVES THE INSTINCT OF THE POOR AND THE WEAK IN THE PRESENCE
OF EVEN IMPERSONAL MAGNIFICENCE AND THEY KEPT BEHIND THE SWANS' HUTCH
HERE AND THERE AT INTERVALS WHEN THE WIND BLEW SHOUTS CLAMOR A SORT
OF TUMULTUOUS DEATH RATTLE WHICH WAS THE FIRING AND DULL BLOWS WHICH
WERE DISCHARGES OF CANNON STRUCK THE EAR CONFUSEDLY
SMOKE HUNG OVER
THE ROOFS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HALLES
A BELL WHICH HAD THE AIR OF
AN APPEAL WAS RINGING IN THE DISTANCE
THESE CHILDREN DID NOT APPEAR TO NOTICE THESE NOISES
THE LITTLE ONE
REPEATED FROM TIME TO TIME I AM HUNGRY
ALMOST AT THE SAME INSTANT WITH THE CHILDREN ANOTHER COUPLE APPROACHED
THE GREAT BASIN
THEY CONSISTED OF A GOODMAN ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE
WHO WAS LEADING BY THE HAND A LITTLE FELLOW OF SIX
NO DOUBT A FATHER
AND HIS SON
THE LITTLE MAN OF SIX HAD A BIG BRIOCHE
AT THAT EPOCH CERTAIN HOUSES ABUTTING ON THE RIVER IN THE RUES MADAME
AND D'ENFER HAD KEYS TO THE LUXEMBOURG GARDEN OF WHICH THE LODGERS
ENJOYED THE USE WHEN THE GATES WERE SHUT A PRIVILEGE WHICH WAS
SUPPRESSED LATER ON
THIS FATHER AND SON CAME FROM ONE OF THESE HOUSES
NO DOUBT
THE TWO POOR LITTLE CREATURES WATCHED THAT GENTLEMAN APPROACHING AND
HID THEMSELVES A LITTLE MORE THOROUGHLY
HE WAS A BOURGEOIS
THE SAME PERSON PERHAPS WHOM MARIUS HAD ONE DAY
HEARD THROUGH HIS LOVE FEVER NEAR THE SAME GRAND BASIN COUNSELLING
HIS SON TO AVOID EXCESSES HE HAD AN AFFABLE AND HAUGHTY AIR AND A
MOUTH WHICH WAS ALWAYS SMILING SINCE IT DID NOT SHUT
THIS MECHANICAL
SMILE PRODUCED BY TOO MUCH JAW AND TOO LITTLE SKIN SHOWS THE TEETH
RATHER THAN THE SOUL
THE CHILD WITH HIS BRIOCHE WHICH HE HAD BITTEN
INTO BUT HAD NOT FINISHED EATING SEEMED SATIATED
THE CHILD WAS DRESSED
AS A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN OWING TO THE INSURRECTION AND THE FATHER HAD
REMAINED CLAD AS A BOURGEOIS OUT OF PRUDENCE
FATHER AND SON HALTED NEAR THE FOUNTAIN WHERE TWO SWANS WERE SPORTING
THIS BOURGEOIS APPEARED TO CHERISH A SPECIAL ADMIRATION FOR THE SWANS
HE RESEMBLED THEM IN THIS SENSE THAT HE WALKED LIKE THEM
FOR THE MOMENT THE SWANS WERE SWIMMING WHICH IS THEIR PRINCIPAL
TALENT AND THEY WERE SUPERB
IF THE TWO POOR LITTLE BEINGS HAD LISTENED AND IF THEY HAD BEEN OF AN
AGE TO UNDERSTAND THEY MIGHT HAVE GATHERED THE WORDS OF THIS GRAVE MAN
THE FATHER WAS SAYING TO HIS SON
THE SAGE LIVES CONTENT WITH LITTLE
LOOK AT ME MY SON
I DO NOT LOVE
POMP
I AM NEVER SEEN IN CLOTHES DECKED WITH GOLD LACE AND STONES I
LEAVE THAT FALSE SPLENDOR TO BADLY ORGANIZED SOULS
HERE THE DEEP SHOUTS WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HALLES
BURST OUT WITH FRESH FORCE OF BELL AND UPROAR
WHAT IS THAT INQUIRED THE CHILD
THE FATHER REPLIED
IT IS THE SATURNALIA
ALL AT ONCE HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TWO LITTLE RAGGED BOYS BEHIND THE
GREEN SWAN HUTCH
THERE IS THE BEGINNING SAID HE
AND AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED
ANARCHY IS ENTERING THIS GARDEN
IN THE MEANWHILE HIS SON TOOK A BITE OF HIS BRIOCHE SPIT IT OUT AND
SUDDENLY BURST OUT CRYING
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT DEMANDED HIS FATHER
I AM NOT HUNGRY ANY MORE SAID THE CHILD
THE FATHER'S SMILE BECAME MORE ACCENTUATED
ONE DOES NOT NEED TO BE HUNGRY IN ORDER TO EAT A CAKE
MY CAKE TIRES ME
IT IS STALE
DON'T YOU WANT ANY MORE OF IT
NO
THE FATHER POINTED TO THE SWANS
THROW IT TO THOSE PALMIPEDS
THE CHILD HESITATED
A PERSON MAY NOT WANT ANY MORE OF HIS CAKE BUT
THAT IS NO REASON FOR GIVING IT AWAY
THE FATHER WENT ON
BE HUMANE
YOU MUST HAVE COMPASSION ON ANIMALS
AND TAKING THE CAKE FROM HIS SON HE FLUNG IT INTO THE BASIN
THE CAKE FELL VERY NEAR THE EDGE
THE SWANS WERE FAR AWAY IN THE CENTRE OF THE BASIN AND BUSY WITH SOME
PREY
THEY HAD SEEN NEITHER THE BOURGEOIS NOR THE BRIOCHE
THE BOURGEOIS FEELING THAT THE CAKE WAS IN DANGER OF BEING WASTED AND
MOVED BY THIS USELESS SHIPWRECK ENTERED UPON A TELEGRAPHIC AGITATION
WHICH FINALLY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE SWANS
THEY PERCEIVED SOMETHING FLOATING STEERED FOR THE EDGE LIKE SHIPS AS
THEY ARE AND SLOWLY DIRECTED THEIR COURSE TOWARD THE BRIOCHE WITH THE
STUPID MAJESTY WHICH BEFITS WHITE CREATURES
THE SWANS CYGNES UNDERSTAND SIGNS SIGNES SAID THE BOURGEOIS
DELIGHTED TO MAKE A JEST
AT THAT MOMENT THE DISTANT TUMULT OF THE CITY UNDERWENT ANOTHER SUDDEN
INCREASE
THIS TIME IT WAS SINISTER
THERE ARE SOME GUSTS OF WIND WHICH
SPEAK MORE DISTINCTLY THAN OTHERS
THE ONE WHICH WAS BLOWING AT THAT
MOMENT BROUGHT CLEARLY DEFINED DRUM BEATS CLAMORS PLATOON FIRING AND
THE DISMAL REPLIES OF THE TOCSIN AND THE CANNON
THIS COINCIDED WITH A
BLACK CLOUD WHICH SUDDENLY VEILED THE SUN
THE SWANS HAD NOT YET REACHED THE BRIOCHE
LET US RETURN HOME SAID THE FATHER THEY ARE ATTACKING THE
TUILERIES
HE GRASPED HIS SON'S HAND AGAIN
THEN HE CONTINUED
FROM THE TUILERIES TO THE LUXEMBOURG THERE IS BUT THE DISTANCE WHICH
SEPARATES ROYALTY FROM THE PEERAGE THAT IS NOT FAR
SHOTS WILL SOON
RAIN DOWN
HE GLANCED AT THE CLOUD
PERHAPS IT IS RAIN ITSELF THAT IS ABOUT TO SHOWER DOWN THE SKY
IS JOINING IN THE YOUNGER BRANCH IS CONDEMNED
LET US RETURN HOME
QUICKLY
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SWANS EAT THE BRIOCHE SAID THE CHILD
THE FATHER REPLIED
THAT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT
AND HE LED HIS LITTLE BOURGEOIS AWAY
THE SON REGRETTING THE SWANS TURNED HIS HEAD BACK TOWARD THE BASIN
UNTIL A CORNER OF THE QUINCUNXES CONCEALED IT FROM HIM
IN THE MEANWHILE THE TWO LITTLE WAIFS HAD APPROACHED THE BRIOCHE AT
THE SAME TIME AS THE SWANS
IT WAS FLOATING ON THE WATER
THE SMALLER OF
THEM STARED AT THE CAKE THE ELDER GAZED AFTER THE RETREATING BOURGEOIS
FATHER AND SON ENTERED THE LABYRINTH OF WALKS WHICH LEADS TO THE GRAND
FLIGHT OF STEPS NEAR THE CLUMP OF TREES ON THE SIDE OF THE RUE MADAME
AS SOON AS THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW THE ELDER CHILD HASTILY
FLUNG HIMSELF FLAT ON HIS STOMACH ON THE ROUNDING CURB OF THE BASIN AND
CLINGING TO IT WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND LEANING OVER THE WATER ON THE
VERGE OF FALLING IN HE STRETCHED OUT HIS RIGHT HAND WITH HIS STICK
TOWARDS THE CAKE
THE SWANS PERCEIVING THE ENEMY MADE HASTE AND IN SO
DOING THEY PRODUCED AN EFFECT OF THEIR BREASTS WHICH WAS OF SERVICE TO
THE LITTLE FISHER THE WATER FLOWED BACK BEFORE THE SWANS AND ONE OF
THESE GENTLE CONCENTRIC UNDULATIONS SOFTLY FLOATED THE BRIOCHE TOWARDS
THE CHILD'S WAND
JUST AS THE SWANS CAME UP THE STICK TOUCHED THE CAKE
THE CHILD GAVE IT A BRISK RAP DREW IN THE BRIOCHE FRIGHTENED AWAY THE
SWANS SEIZED THE CAKE AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET
THE CAKE WAS WET
BUT THEY WERE HUNGRY AND THIRSTY
THE ELDER BROKE THE CAKE INTO TWO
PORTIONS A LARGE ONE AND A SMALL ONE TOOK THE SMALL ONE FOR HIMSELF
GAVE THE LARGE ONE TO HIS BROTHER AND SAID TO HIM
RAM THAT INTO YOUR MUZZLE
CHAPTER XVII MORTUUS PATER FILIUM MORITURUM EXPECTAT
MARIUS DASHED OUT OF THE BARRICADE COMBEFERRE FOLLOWED HIM
BUT HE
WAS TOO LATE
GAVROCHE WAS DEAD
COMBEFERRE BROUGHT BACK THE BASKET OF
CARTRIDGES MARIUS BORE THE CHILD
ALAS HE THOUGHT THAT WHICH THE FATHER HAD DONE FOR HIS FATHER HE
WAS REQUITING TO THE SON ONLY THENARDIER HAD BROUGHT BACK HIS FATHER
ALIVE HE WAS BRINGING BACK THE CHILD DEAD
WHEN MARIUS RE ENTERED THE REDOUBT WITH GAVROCHE IN HIS ARMS HIS FACE
LIKE THE CHILD WAS INUNDATED WITH BLOOD
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE HAD STOOPED TO LIFT GAVROCHE A BULLET HAD GRAZED
HIS HEAD HE HAD NOT NOTICED IT
COURFEYRAC UNTIED HIS CRAVAT AND WITH IT BANDAGED MARIUS' BROW
THEY LAID GAVROCHE ON THE SAME TABLE WITH MABEUF AND SPREAD OVER THE
TWO CORPSES THE BLACK SHAWL
THERE WAS ENOUGH OF IT FOR BOTH THE OLD MAN
AND THE CHILD
COMBEFERRE DISTRIBUTED THE CARTRIDGES FROM THE BASKET WHICH HE HAD
BROUGHT IN
THIS GAVE EACH MAN FIFTEEN ROUNDS TO FIRE
JEAN VALJEAN WAS STILL IN THE SAME PLACE MOTIONLESS ON HIS STONE POST
WHEN COMBEFERRE OFFERED HIM HIS FIFTEEN CARTRIDGES HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
HERE'S A RARE ECCENTRIC SAID COMBEFERRE IN A LOW VOICE TO ENJOLRAS
HE FINDS A WAY OF NOT FIGHTING IN THIS BARRICADE
WHICH DOES NOT PREVENT HIM FROM DEFENDING IT RESPONDED ENJOLRAS
HEROISM HAS ITS ORIGINALS RESUMED COMBEFERRE
AND COURFEYRAC WHO HAD OVERHEARD ADDED
HE IS ANOTHER SORT FROM FATHER MABEUF
ONE THING WHICH MUST BE NOTED IS THAT THE FIRE WHICH WAS BATTERING THE
BARRICADE HARDLY DISTURBED THE INTERIOR
THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER TRAVERSED
THE WHIRLWIND OF THIS SORT OF WAR CAN FORM NO IDEA OF THE SINGULAR
MOMENTS OF TRANQUILLITY MINGLED WITH THESE CONVULSIONS
MEN GO AND
COME THEY TALK THEY JEST THEY LOUNGE
SOME ONE WHOM WE KNOW HEARD A
COMBATANT SAY TO HIM IN THE MIDST OF THE GRAPE SHOT WE ARE HERE AS
AT A BACHELOR BREAKFAST THE REDOUBT OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE WE
REPEAT SEEMED VERY CALM WITHIN
ALL MUTATIONS AND ALL PHASES HAD BEEN
OR WERE ABOUT TO BE EXHAUSTED
THE POSITION FROM CRITICAL HAD BECOME
MENACING AND FROM MENACING WAS PROBABLY ABOUT TO BECOME DESPERATE
IN
PROPORTION AS THE SITUATION GREW GLOOMY THE GLOW OF HEROISM EMPURPLED
THE BARRICADE MORE AND MORE
ENJOLRAS WHO WAS GRAVE DOMINATED IT
IN THE ATTITUDE OF A YOUNG SPARTAN SACRIFICING HIS NAKED SWORD TO THE
SOMBRE GENIUS EPIDOTAS
COMBEFERRE WEARING AN APRON WAS DRESSING THE WOUNDS BOSSUET AND
FEUILLY WERE MAKING CARTRIDGES WITH THE POWDER FLASK PICKED UP BY
GAVROCHE ON THE DEAD CORPORAL AND BOSSUET SAID TO FEUILLY WE ARE SOON
TO TAKE THE DILIGENCE FOR ANOTHER PLANET COURFEYRAC WAS DISPOSING AND
ARRANGING ON SOME PAVING STONES WHICH HE HAD RESERVED FOR HIMSELF NEAR
ENJOLRAS A COMPLETE ARSENAL HIS SWORD CANE HIS GUN TWO HOLSTER
PISTOLS AND A CUDGEL WITH THE CARE OF A YOUNG GIRL SETTING A SMALL
DUNKERQUE IN ORDER
JEAN VALJEAN STARED SILENTLY AT THE WALL OPPOSITE
HIM
AN ARTISAN WAS FASTENING MOTHER HUCHELOUP'S BIG STRAW HAT ON HIS
HEAD WITH A STRING FOR FEAR OF SUN STROKE AS HE SAID
THE YOUNG
MEN FROM THE COUGOURDE D'AIX WERE CHATTING MERRILY AMONG THEMSELVES
AS THOUGH EAGER TO SPEAK PATOIS FOR THE LAST TIME
JOLY WHO HAD TAKEN
WIDOW HUCHELOUP'S MIRROR FROM THE WALL WAS EXAMINING HIS TONGUE IN IT
SOME COMBATANTS HAVING DISCOVERED A FEW CRUSTS OF RATHER MOULDY BREAD
IN A DRAWER WERE EAGERLY DEVOURING THEM
MARIUS WAS DISTURBED WITH
REGARD TO WHAT HIS FATHER WAS ABOUT TO SAY TO HIM
CHAPTER XVIII THE VULTURE BECOME PREY
WE MUST INSIST UPON ONE PSYCHOLOGICAL FACT PECULIAR TO BARRICADES
NOTHING WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THAT SURPRISING WAR OF THE STREETS
SHOULD BE OMITTED
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE SINGULAR INWARD TRANQUILLITY WHICH WE HAVE
JUST MENTIONED THE BARRICADE FOR THOSE WHO ARE INSIDE IT REMAINS
NONE THE LESS A VISION
THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE APOCALYPSE IN CIVIL WAR ALL THE MISTS OF THE
UNKNOWN ARE COMMINGLED WITH FIERCE FLASHES REVOLUTIONS ARE SPHINXES
AND ANY ONE WHO HAS PASSED THROUGH A BARRICADE THINKS HE HAS TRAVERSED A
DREAM
THE FEELINGS TO WHICH ONE IS SUBJECT IN THESE PLACES WE HAVE POINTED OUT
IN THE CASE OF MARIUS AND WE SHALL SEE THE CONSEQUENCES THEY ARE BOTH
MORE AND LESS THAN LIFE
ON EMERGING FROM A BARRICADE ONE NO LONGER
KNOWS WHAT ONE HAS SEEN THERE
ONE HAS BEEN TERRIBLE BUT ONE KNOWS
IT NOT
ONE HAS BEEN SURROUNDED WITH CONFLICTING IDEAS WHICH HAD HUMAN
FACES ONE'S HEAD HAS BEEN IN THE LIGHT OF THE FUTURE
THERE WERE
CORPSES LYING PRONE THERE AND PHANTOMS STANDING ERECT
THE HOURS WERE
COLOSSAL AND SEEMED HOURS OF ETERNITY
ONE HAS LIVED IN DEATH
SHADOWS
HAVE PASSED BY
WHAT WERE THEY
ONE HAS BEHELD HANDS ON WHICH THERE WAS BLOOD THERE WAS A DEAFENING
HORROR THERE WAS ALSO A FRIGHTFUL SILENCE THERE WERE OPEN MOUTHS WHICH
SHOUTED AND OTHER OPEN MOUTHS WHICH HELD THEIR PEACE ONE WAS IN THE
MIDST OF SMOKE OF NIGHT PERHAPS
ONE FANCIED THAT ONE HAD TOUCHED THE
SINISTER OOZE OF UNKNOWN DEPTHS ONE STARES AT SOMETHING RED ON ONE'S
FINGER NAILS
ONE NO LONGER REMEMBERS ANYTHING
LET US RETURN TO THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE
ALL AT ONCE BETWEEN TWO DISCHARGES THE DISTANT SOUND OF A CLOCK
STRIKING THE HOUR BECAME AUDIBLE
IT IS MIDDAY SAID COMBEFERRE
THE TWELVE STROKES HAD NOT FINISHED STRIKING WHEN ENJOLRAS SPRANG TO HIS
FEET AND FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE BARRICADE HURLED THIS THUNDERING SHOUT
CARRY STONES UP INTO THE HOUSES LINE THE WINDOWSILLS AND THE
ROOFS WITH THEM
HALF THE MEN TO THEIR GUNS THE OTHER HALF TO THE
PAVING STONES
THERE IS NOT A MINUTE TO BE LOST
A SQUAD OF SAPPERS AND MINERS AXE ON SHOULDER HAD JUST MADE THEIR
APPEARANCE IN BATTLE ARRAY AT THE END OF THE STREET
THIS COULD ONLY BE THE HEAD OF A COLUMN AND OF WHAT COLUMN THE
ATTACKING COLUMN EVIDENTLY THE SAPPERS CHARGED WITH THE DEMOLITION OF
THE BARRICADE MUST ALWAYS PRECEDE THE SOLDIERS WHO ARE TO SCALE IT
THEY WERE EVIDENTLY ON THE BRINK OF THAT MOMENT WHICH M
CLERMONT TONNERRE IN 1822 CALLED THE TUG OF WAR
ENJOLRAS' ORDER WAS EXECUTED WITH THE CORRECT HASTE WHICH IS PECULIAR
TO SHIPS AND BARRICADES THE ONLY TWO SCENES OF COMBAT WHERE ESCAPE
IS IMPOSSIBLE
IN LESS THAN A MINUTE TWO THIRDS OF THE STONES WHICH
ENJOLRAS HAD HAD PILED UP AT THE DOOR OF CORINTHE HAD BEEN CARRIED UP TO
THE FIRST FLOOR AND THE ATTIC AND BEFORE A SECOND MINUTE HAD ELAPSED
THESE STONES ARTISTICALLY SET ONE UPON THE OTHER WALLED UP THE
SASH WINDOW ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND THE WINDOWS IN THE ROOF TO HALF THEIR
HEIGHT
A FEW LOOP HOLES CAREFULLY PLANNED BY FEUILLY THE PRINCIPAL
ARCHITECT ALLOWED OF THE PASSAGE OF THE GUN BARRELS
THIS ARMAMENT OF
THE WINDOWS COULD BE EFFECTED ALL THE MORE EASILY SINCE THE FIRING OF
GRAPE SHOT HAD CEASED
THE TWO CANNONS WERE NOW DISCHARGING BALL
AGAINST THE CENTRE OF THE BARRIER IN ORDER TO MAKE A HOLE THERE AND IF
POSSIBLE A BREACH FOR THE ASSAULT
WHEN THE STONES DESTINED TO THE FINAL DEFENCE WERE IN PLACE ENJOLRAS
HAD THE BOTTLES WHICH HE HAD SET UNDER THE TABLE WHERE MABEUF LAY
CARRIED TO THE FIRST FLOOR
WHO IS TO DRINK THAT BOSSUET ASKED HIM
THEY REPLIED ENJOLRAS
THEN THEY BARRICADED THE WINDOW BELOW AND HELD IN READINESS THE IRON
CROSS BARS WHICH SERVED TO SECURE THE DOOR OF THE WINE SHOP AT NIGHT
THE FORTRESS WAS COMPLETE
THE BARRICADE WAS THE RAMPART THE WINE SHOP
WAS THE DUNGEON
WITH THE STONES WHICH REMAINED THEY STOPPED UP THE
OUTLET
AS THE DEFENDERS OF A BARRICADE ARE ALWAYS OBLIGED TO BE SPARING OF
THEIR AMMUNITION AND AS THE ASSAILANTS KNOW THIS THE ASSAILANTS
COMBINE THEIR ARRANGEMENTS WITH A SORT OF IRRITATING LEISURE EXPOSE
THEMSELVES TO FIRE PREMATURELY THOUGH IN APPEARANCE MORE THAN IN
REALITY AND TAKE THEIR EASE
THE PREPARATIONS FOR ATTACK ARE ALWAYS
MADE WITH A CERTAIN METHODICAL DELIBERATION AFTER WHICH THE LIGHTNING
STRIKES
THIS DELIBERATION PERMITTED ENJOLRAS TO TAKE A REVIEW OF EVERYTHING AND
TO PERFECT EVERYTHING
HE FELT THAT SINCE SUCH MEN WERE TO DIE THEIR
DEATH OUGHT TO BE A MASTERPIECE
HE SAID TO MARIUS WE ARE THE TWO LEADERS
I WILL GIVE THE LAST ORDERS
INSIDE
DO YOU REMAIN OUTSIDE AND OBSERVE
MARIUS POSTED HIMSELF ON THE LOOKOUT UPON THE CREST OF THE BARRICADE
ENJOLRAS HAD THE DOOR OF THE KITCHEN WHICH WAS THE AMBULANCE AS THE
READER WILL REMEMBER NAILED UP
NO SPLASHING OF THE WOUNDED HE SAID
HE ISSUED HIS FINAL ORDERS IN THE TAP ROOM IN A CURT BUT PROFOUNDLY
TRANQUIL TONE FEUILLY LISTENED AND REPLIED IN THE NAME OF ALL
ON THE FIRST FLOOR HOLD YOUR AXES IN READINESS TO CUT THE STAIRCASE
HAVE YOU THEM
YES SAID FEUILLY
HOW MANY
TWO AXES AND A POLE AXE
THAT IS GOOD
THERE ARE NOW TWENTY SIX COMBATANTS OF US ON FOOT
HOW
MANY GUNS ARE THERE
THIRTY FOUR
EIGHT TOO MANY
KEEP THOSE EIGHT GUNS LOADED LIKE THE REST AND AT
HAND
SWORDS AND PISTOLS IN YOUR BELTS
TWENTY MEN TO THE BARRICADE
SIX
AMBUSHED IN THE ATTIC WINDOWS AND AT THE WINDOW ON THE FIRST FLOOR TO
FIRE ON THE ASSAILANTS THROUGH THE LOOP HOLES IN THE STONES
LET NOT A
SINGLE WORKER REMAIN INACTIVE HERE
PRESENTLY WHEN THE DRUM BEATS THE
ASSAULT LET THE TWENTY BELOW STAIRS RUSH TO THE BARRICADE
THE FIRST TO
ARRIVE WILL HAVE THE BEST PLACES
THESE ARRANGEMENTS MADE HE TURNED TO JAVERT AND SAID
I AM NOT FORGETTING YOU
AND LAYING A PISTOL ON THE TABLE HE ADDED
THE LAST MAN TO LEAVE THIS ROOM WILL SMASH THE SKULL OF THIS SPY
HERE INQUIRED A VOICE
NO LET US NOT MIX THEIR CORPSES WITH OUR OWN
THE LITTLE BARRICADE OF
THE MONDETOUR LANE CAN BE SCALED
IT IS ONLY FOUR FEET HIGH
THE MAN IS
WELL PINIONED
HE SHALL BE TAKEN THITHER AND PUT TO DEATH
THERE WAS SOME ONE WHO WAS MORE IMPASSIVE AT THAT MOMENT THAN ENJOLRAS
IT WAS JAVERT
HERE JEAN VALJEAN MADE HIS APPEARANCE
HE HAD BEEN LOST AMONG THE GROUP OF INSURGENTS
HE STEPPED FORTH AND
SAID TO ENJOLRAS
YOU ARE THE COMMANDER
YES
YOU THANKED ME A WHILE AGO
IN THE NAME OF THE REPUBLIC
THE BARRICADE HAS TWO SAVIORS MARIUS
PONTMERCY AND YOURSELF
DO YOU THINK THAT I DESERVE A RECOMPENSE
CERTAINLY
WELL I REQUEST ONE
WHAT IS IT
THAT I MAY BLOW THAT MAN'S BRAINS OUT
JAVERT RAISED HIS HEAD SAW JEAN VALJEAN MADE AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE
MOVEMENT AND SAID
THAT IS JUST
AS FOR ENJOLRAS HE HAD BEGUN TO RE LOAD HIS RIFLE HE CUT HIS EYES
ABOUT HIM
NO OBJECTIONS
AND HE TURNED TO JEAN VALJEAN
TAKE THE SPY
JEAN VALJEAN DID IN FACT TAKE POSSESSION OF JAVERT BY SEATING
HIMSELF ON THE END OF THE TABLE
HE SEIZED THE PISTOL AND A FAINT CLICK
ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD COCKED IT
ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT A BLAST OF TRUMPETS BECAME AUDIBLE
TAKE CARE SHOUTED MARIUS FROM THE TOP OF THE BARRICADE
JAVERT BEGAN TO LAUGH WITH THAT NOISELESS LAUGH WHICH WAS PECULIAR TO
HIM AND GAZING INTENTLY AT THE INSURGENTS HE SAID TO THEM
YOU ARE IN NO BETTER CASE THAN I AM
ALL OUT SHOUTED ENJOLRAS
THE INSURGENTS POURED OUT TUMULTUOUSLY AND AS THEY WENT RECEIVED IN
THE BACK MAY WE BE PERMITTED THE EXPRESSION THIS SALLY OF JAVERT'S
WE SHALL MEET AGAIN SHORTLY
CHAPTER XIX JEAN VALJEAN TAKES HIS REVENGE
WHEN JEAN VALJEAN WAS LEFT ALONE WITH JAVERT HE UNTIED THE ROPE WHICH
FASTENED THE PRISONER ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY AND THE KNOT OF
WHICH WAS UNDER THE TABLE
AFTER THIS HE MADE HIM A SIGN TO RISE
JAVERT OBEYED WITH THAT INDEFINABLE SMILE IN WHICH THE SUPREMACY OF
ENCHAINED AUTHORITY IS CONDENSED
JEAN VALJEAN TOOK JAVERT BY THE MARTINGALE AS ONE WOULD TAKE A BEAST OF
BURDEN BY THE BREAST BAND AND DRAGGING THE LATTER AFTER HIM EMERGED
FROM THE WINE SHOP SLOWLY BECAUSE JAVERT WITH HIS IMPEDED LIMBS COULD
TAKE ONLY VERY SHORT STEPS
JEAN VALJEAN HAD THE PISTOL IN HIS HAND
IN THIS MANNER THEY CROSSED THE INNER TRAPEZIUM OF THE BARRICADE
THE
INSURGENTS ALL INTENT ON THE ATTACK WHICH WAS IMMINENT HAD THEIR
BACKS TURNED TO THESE TWO
MARIUS ALONE STATIONED ON ONE SIDE AT THE EXTREME LEFT OF THE
BARRICADE SAW THEM PASS
THIS GROUP OF VICTIM AND EXECUTIONER WAS
ILLUMINATED BY THE SEPULCHRAL LIGHT WHICH HE BORE IN HIS OWN SOUL
JEAN VALJEAN WITH SOME DIFFICULTY BUT WITHOUT RELAXING HIS HOLD FOR
A SINGLE INSTANT MADE JAVERT PINIONED AS HE WAS SCALE THE LITTLE
ENTRENCHMENT IN THE MONDETOUR LANE
WHEN THEY HAD CROSSED THIS BARRIER THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE IN THE
LANE
NO ONE SAW THEM
AMONG THE HEAP THEY COULD DISTINGUISH A LIVID
FACE STREAMING HAIR A PIERCED HAND AND THE HALF NUDE BREAST OF A
WOMAN
IT WAS EPONINE
THE CORNER OF THE HOUSES HID THEM FROM THE
INSURGENTS
THE CORPSES CARRIED AWAY FROM THE BARRICADE FORMED A
TERRIBLE PILE A FEW PACES DISTANT
JAVERT GAZED ASKANCE AT THIS BODY AND PROFOUNDLY CALM SAID IN A LOW
TONE
IT STRIKES ME THAT I KNOW THAT GIRL
THEN HE TURNED TO JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN THRUST THE PISTOL UNDER HIS ARM AND FIXED ON JAVERT A LOOK
WHICH IT REQUIRED NO WORDS TO INTERPRET JAVERT IT IS I
JAVERT REPLIED
TAKE YOUR REVENGE
JEAN VALJEAN DREW FROM HIS POCKET A KNIFE AND OPENED IT
A CLASP KNIFE EXCLAIMED JAVERT YOU ARE RIGHT
THAT SUITS YOU
BETTER
JEAN VALJEAN CUT THE MARTINGALE WHICH JAVERT HAD ABOUT HIS NECK THEN HE
CUT THE CORDS ON HIS WRISTS THEN STOOPING DOWN HE CUT THE CORD ON HIS
FEET AND STRAIGHTENING HIMSELF UP HE SAID TO HIM
YOU ARE FREE
JAVERT WAS NOT EASILY ASTONISHED
STILL MASTER OF HIMSELF THOUGH
HE WAS HE COULD NOT REPRESS A START
HE REMAINED OPEN MOUTHED AND
MOTIONLESS
JEAN VALJEAN CONTINUED
I DO NOT THINK THAT I SHALL ESCAPE FROM THIS PLACE
BUT IF BY CHANCE
I DO I LIVE UNDER THE NAME OF FAUCHELEVENT IN THE RUE DE L'HOMME
ARME NO
7
JAVERT SNARLED LIKE A TIGER WHICH MADE HIM HALF OPEN ONE CORNER OF HIS
MOUTH AND HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
HAVE A CARE
GO SAID JEAN VALJEAN
JAVERT BEGAN AGAIN
THOU SAIDST FAUCHELEVENT RUE DE L'HOMME ARME
NUMBER 7
JAVERT REPEATED IN A LOW VOICE NUMBER 7
HE BUTTONED UP HIS COAT ONCE MORE RESUMED THE MILITARY STIFFNESS
BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS MADE A HALF TURN FOLDED HIS ARMS AND SUPPORTING
HIS CHIN ON ONE OF HIS HANDS HE SET OUT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HALLES
JEAN VALJEAN FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES
A FEW MINUTES LATER JAVERT TURNED ROUND AND SHOUTED TO JEAN VALJEAN
YOU ANNOY ME
KILL ME RATHER
JAVERT HIMSELF DID NOT NOTICE THAT HE NO LONGER ADDRESSED JEAN VALJEAN
AS THOU
BE OFF WITH YOU SAID JEAN VALJEAN
JAVERT RETREATED SLOWLY
A MOMENT LATER HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE RUE
DES PRECHEURS
WHEN JAVERT HAD DISAPPEARED JEAN VALJEAN FIRED HIS PISTOL IN THE AIR
THEN HE RETURNED TO THE BARRICADE AND SAID
IT IS DONE
IN THE MEANWHILE THIS IS WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
MARIUS MORE INTENT ON THE OUTSIDE THAN ON THE INTERIOR HAD NOT UP TO
THAT TIME TAKEN A GOOD LOOK AT THE PINIONED SPY IN THE DARK BACKGROUND
OF THE TAP ROOM
WHEN HE BEHELD HIM IN BROAD DAYLIGHT STRIDING OVER THE BARRICADE IN
ORDER TO PROCEED TO HIS DEATH HE RECOGNIZED HIM
SOMETHING SUDDENLY
RECURRED TO HIS MIND
HE RECALLED THE INSPECTOR OF THE RUE DE PONTOISE
AND THE TWO PISTOLS WHICH THE LATTER HAD HANDED TO HIM AND WHICH HE
MARIUS HAD USED IN THIS VERY BARRICADE AND NOT ONLY DID HE RECALL HIS
FACE BUT HIS NAME AS WELL
THIS RECOLLECTION WAS MISTY AND TROUBLED HOWEVER LIKE ALL HIS IDEAS
IT WAS NOT AN AFFIRMATION THAT HE MADE BUT A QUESTION WHICH HE PUT TO
HIMSELF
IS NOT THAT THE INSPECTOR OF POLICE WHO TOLD ME THAT HIS NAME WAS
JAVERT
PERHAPS THERE WAS STILL TIME TO INTERVENE IN BEHALF OF THAT MAN
BUT IN
THE FIRST PLACE HE MUST KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS JAVERT
MARIUS CALLED TO ENJOLRAS WHO HAD JUST STATIONED HIMSELF AT THE OTHER
EXTREMITY OF THE BARRICADE
ENJOLRAS
WHAT
WHAT IS THE NAME OF YONDER MAN
WHAT MAN
THE POLICE AGENT
DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME
OF COURSE
HE TOLD US
WHAT IS IT
JAVERT
MARIUS SPRANG TO HIS FEET
AT THAT MOMENT THEY HEARD THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL
JEAN VALJEAN RE APPEARED AND CRIED IT IS DONE
A GLOOMY CHILL TRAVERSED MARIUS' HEART
CHAPTER XX THE DEAD ARE IN THE RIGHT AND THE LIVING ARE NOT IN THE
WRONG
THE DEATH AGONY OF THE BARRICADE WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN
EVERYTHING CONTRIBUTED TO ITS TRAGIC MAJESTY AT THAT SUPREME MOMENT A
THOUSAND MYSTERIOUS CRASHES IN THE AIR THE BREATH OF ARMED MASSES SET
IN MOVEMENT IN THE STREETS WHICH WERE NOT VISIBLE THE INTERMITTENT
GALLOP OF CAVALRY THE HEAVY SHOCK OF ARTILLERY ON THE MARCH THE FIRING
BY SQUADS AND THE CANNONADES CROSSING EACH OTHER IN THE LABYRINTH
OF PARIS THE SMOKES OF BATTLE MOUNTING ALL GILDED ABOVE THE ROOFS
INDESCRIBABLE AND VAGUELY TERRIBLE CRIES LIGHTNINGS OF MENACE
EVERYWHERE THE TOCSIN OF SAINT MERRY WHICH NOW HAD THE ACCENTS OF A
SOB THE MILDNESS OF THE WEATHER THE SPLENDOR OF THE SKY FILLED WITH
SUN AND CLOUDS THE BEAUTY OF THE DAY AND THE ALARMING SILENCE OF THE
HOUSES
FOR SINCE THE PRECEDING EVENING THE TWO ROWS OF HOUSES IN THE RUE
DE LA CHANVRERIE HAD BECOME TWO WALLS FEROCIOUS WALLS DOORS CLOSED
WINDOWS CLOSED SHUTTERS CLOSED
IN THOSE DAYS SO DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN WHICH WE LIVE WHEN THE HOUR
WAS COME WHEN THE PEOPLE WISHED TO PUT AN END TO A SITUATION WHICH HAD
LASTED TOO LONG WITH A CHARTER GRANTED OR WITH A LEGAL COUNTRY WHEN
UNIVERSAL WRATH WAS DIFFUSED IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHEN THE CITY CONSENTED
TO THE TEARING UP OF THE PAVEMENTS WHEN INSURRECTION MADE THE
BOURGEOISIE SMILE BY WHISPERING ITS PASSWORD IN ITS EAR THEN THE
INHABITANT THOROUGHLY PENETRATED WITH THE REVOLT SO TO SPEAK WAS
THE AUXILIARY OF THE COMBATANT AND THE HOUSE FRATERNIZED WITH THE
IMPROVISED FORTRESS WHICH RESTED ON IT
WHEN THE SITUATION WAS NOT
RIPE WHEN THE INSURRECTION WAS NOT DECIDEDLY ADMITTED WHEN THE MASSES
DISOWNED THE MOVEMENT ALL WAS OVER WITH THE COMBATANTS THE CITY WAS
CHANGED INTO A DESERT AROUND THE REVOLT SOULS GREW CHILLED REFUGES
WERE NAILED UP AND THE STREET TURNED INTO A DEFILE TO HELP THE ARMY TO
TAKE THE BARRICADE
A PEOPLE CANNOT BE FORCED THROUGH SURPRISE TO WALK MORE QUICKLY THAN
IT CHOOSES
WOE TO WHOMSOEVER TRIES TO FORCE ITS HAND A PEOPLE DOES NOT
LET ITSELF GO AT RANDOM
THEN IT ABANDONS THE INSURRECTION TO ITSELF
THE INSURGENTS BECOME NOXIOUS INFECTED WITH THE PLAGUE
A HOUSE IS AN
ESCARPMENT A DOOR IS A REFUSAL A FACADE IS A WALL
THIS WALL HEARS
SEES AND WILL NOT
IT MIGHT OPEN AND SAVE YOU
NO
THIS WALL IS A JUDGE
IT GAZES AT YOU AND CONDEMNS YOU
WHAT DISMAL THINGS ARE CLOSED HOUSES
THEY SEEM DEAD THEY ARE LIVING
LIFE WHICH IS AS IT WERE SUSPENDED
THERE PERSISTS THERE
NO ONE HAS GONE OUT OF THEM FOR FOUR AND TWENTY
HOURS BUT NO ONE IS MISSING FROM THEM
IN THE INTERIOR OF THAT ROCK
PEOPLE GO AND COME GO TO BED AND RISE AGAIN THEY ARE A FAMILY PARTY
THERE THERE THEY EAT AND DRINK THEY ARE AFRAID A TERRIBLE THING FEAR
EXCUSES THIS FEARFUL LACK OF HOSPITALITY TERROR IS MIXED WITH IT AN
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE
SOMETIMES EVEN AND THIS HAS BEEN ACTUALLY
SEEN FEAR TURNS TO PASSION FRIGHT MAY CHANGE INTO FURY AS PRUDENCE
DOES INTO RAGE HENCE THIS WISE SAYING THE ENRAGED MODERATES THERE
ARE OUTBURSTS OF SUPREME TERROR WHENCE SPRINGS WRATH LIKE A MOURNFUL
SMOKE WHAT DO THESE PEOPLE WANT WHAT HAVE THEY COME THERE TO DO
LET THEM GET OUT OF THE SCRAPE
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THEM
IT IS THEIR
FAULT
THEY ARE ONLY GETTING WHAT THEY DESERVE
IT DOES NOT CONCERN
US
HERE IS OUR POOR STREET ALL RIDDLED WITH BALLS
THEY ARE A PACK OF
RASCALS
ABOVE ALL THINGS DON'T OPEN THE DOOR AND THE HOUSE ASSUMES
THE AIR OF A TOMB
THE INSURGENT IS IN THE DEATH THROES IN FRONT OF
THAT HOUSE HE SEES THE GRAPE SHOT AND NAKED SWORDS DRAWING NEAR IF
HE CRIES HE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE LISTENING TO HIM AND THAT NO ONE WILL
COME THERE STAND WALLS WHICH MIGHT PROTECT HIM THERE ARE MEN WHO MIGHT
SAVE HIM AND THESE WALLS HAVE EARS OF FLESH AND THESE MEN HAVE BOWELS
OF STONE
WHOM SHALL HE REPROACH
NO ONE AND EVERY ONE
THE INCOMPLETE TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE
IT IS ALWAYS AT ITS OWN RISK AND PERIL THAT UTOPIA IS CONVERTED INTO
REVOLUTION AND FROM PHILOSOPHICAL PROTEST BECOMES AN ARMED PROTEST AND
FROM MINERVA TURNS TO PALLAS
THE UTOPIA WHICH GROWS IMPATIENT AND BECOMES REVOLT KNOWS WHAT AWAITS
IT IT ALMOST ALWAYS COMES TOO SOON
THEN IT BECOMES RESIGNED AND
STOICALLY ACCEPTS CATASTROPHE IN LIEU OF TRIUMPH
IT SERVES THOSE WHO
DENY IT WITHOUT COMPLAINT EVEN EXCUSING THEM AND EVEN DISCULPATES
THEM AND ITS MAGNANIMITY CONSISTS IN CONSENTING TO ABANDONMENT
IT IS
INDOMITABLE IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES AND GENTLE TOWARDS INGRATITUDE
IS THIS INGRATITUDE HOWEVER
YES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE HUMAN RACE
NO FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE INDIVIDUAL
PROGRESS IS MAN'S MODE OF EXISTENCE
THE GENERAL LIFE OF THE HUMAN RACE
IS CALLED PROGRESS THE COLLECTIVE STRIDE OF THE HUMAN RACE IS CALLED
PROGRESS
PROGRESS ADVANCES IT MAKES THE GREAT HUMAN AND TERRESTRIAL
JOURNEY TOWARDS THE CELESTIAL AND THE DIVINE IT HAS ITS HALTING
PLACES WHERE IT RALLIES THE LAGGARD TROOP IT HAS ITS STATIONS WHERE IT
MEDITATES IN THE PRESENCE OF SOME SPLENDID CANAAN SUDDENLY UNVEILED
ON ITS HORIZON IT HAS ITS NIGHTS WHEN IT SLEEPS AND IT IS ONE OF THE
POIGNANT ANXIETIES OF THE THINKER THAT HE SEES THE SHADOW RESTING ON THE
HUMAN SOUL AND THAT HE GROPES IN DARKNESS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO AWAKEN
THAT SLUMBERING PROGRESS
GOD IS DEAD PERHAPS SAID GERARD DE NERVAL ONE DAY TO THE WRITER OF
THESE LINES CONFOUNDING PROGRESS WITH GOD AND TAKING THE INTERRUPTION
OF MOVEMENT FOR THE DEATH OF BEING
HE WHO DESPAIRS IS IN THE WRONG
PROGRESS INFALLIBLY AWAKES AND IN
SHORT WE MAY SAY THAT IT MARCHES ON EVEN WHEN IT IS ASLEEP FOR IT HAS
INCREASED IN SIZE
WHEN WE BEHOLD IT ERECT ONCE MORE WE FIND IT TALLER
TO BE ALWAYS PEACEFUL DOES NOT DEPEND ON PROGRESS ANY MORE THAN IT DOES
ON THE STREAM ERECT NO BARRIERS CAST IN NO BOULDERS OBSTACLES MAKE
WATER FROTH AND HUMANITY BOIL
HENCE ARISE TROUBLES BUT AFTER THESE
TROUBLES WE RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT GROUND HAS BEEN GAINED
UNTIL
ORDER WHICH IS NOTHING ELSE THAN UNIVERSAL PEACE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED
UNTIL HARMONY AND UNITY REIGN PROGRESS WILL HAVE REVOLUTIONS AS ITS
HALTING PLACES
WHAT THEN IS PROGRESS WE HAVE JUST ENUNCIATED IT THE PERMANENT LIFE
OF THE PEOPLES
NOW IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT THE MOMENTARY LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS OFFERS
RESISTANCE TO THE ETERNAL LIFE OF THE HUMAN RACE
LET US ADMIT WITHOUT BITTERNESS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS HIS DISTINCT
INTERESTS AND CAN WITHOUT FORFEITURE STIPULATE FOR HIS INTEREST AND
DEFEND IT THE PRESENT HAS ITS PARDONABLE DOSE OF EGOTISM MOMENTARY
LIFE HAS ITS RIGHTS AND IS NOT BOUND TO SACRIFICE ITSELF CONSTANTLY TO
THE FUTURE
THE GENERATION WHICH IS PASSING IN ITS TURN OVER THE EARTH
IS NOT FORCED TO ABRIDGE IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE GENERATIONS ITS EQUAL
AFTER ALL WHO WILL HAVE THEIR TURN LATER ON I EXIST MURMURS THAT
SOME ONE WHOSE NAME IS ALL
I AM YOUNG AND IN LOVE I AM OLD AND I
WISH TO REPOSE I AM THE FATHER OF A FAMILY I TOIL I PROSPER I AM
SUCCESSFUL IN BUSINESS I HAVE HOUSES TO LEASE I HAVE MONEY IN THE
GOVERNMENT FUNDS I AM HAPPY I HAVE A WIFE AND CHILDREN I HAVE ALL
THIS I DESIRE TO LIVE LEAVE ME IN PEACE HENCE AT CERTAIN HOURS A
PROFOUND COLD BROODS OVER THE MAGNANIMOUS VANGUARD OF THE HUMAN RACE
UTOPIA MOREOVER WE MUST ADMIT QUITS ITS RADIANT SPHERE WHEN IT MAKES
WAR
IT THE TRUTH OF TO MORROW BORROWS ITS MODE OF PROCEDURE BATTLE
FROM THE LIE OF YESTERDAY
IT THE FUTURE BEHAVES LIKE THE PAST
IT
PURE IDEA BECOMES A DEED OF VIOLENCE
IT COMPLICATES ITS HEROISM WITH
A VIOLENCE FOR WHICH IT IS JUST THAT IT SHOULD BE HELD TO ANSWER A
VIOLENCE OF OCCASION AND EXPEDIENT CONTRARY TO PRINCIPLE AND FOR WHICH
IT IS FATALLY PUNISHED
THE UTOPIA INSURRECTION FIGHTS WITH THE OLD
MILITARY CODE IN ITS FIST IT SHOOTS SPIES IT EXECUTES TRAITORS IT
SUPPRESSES LIVING BEINGS AND FLINGS THEM INTO UNKNOWN DARKNESS
IT MAKES
USE OF DEATH A SERIOUS MATTER
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH UTOPIA HAD NO LONGER
ANY FAITH IN RADIANCE ITS IRRESISTIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE FORCE
IT
STRIKES WITH THE SWORD
NOW NO SWORD IS SIMPLE
EVERY BLADE HAS TWO
EDGES HE WHO WOUNDS WITH THE ONE IS WOUNDED WITH THE OTHER
HAVING MADE THIS RESERVATION AND MADE IT WITH ALL SEVERITY IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR US NOT TO ADMIRE WHETHER THEY SUCCEED OR NOT THOSE THE
GLORIOUS COMBATANTS OF THE FUTURE THE CONFESSORS OF UTOPIA
EVEN WHEN
THEY MISCARRY THEY ARE WORTHY OF VENERATION AND IT IS PERHAPS IN
FAILURE THAT THEY POSSESS THE MOST MAJESTY
VICTORY WHEN IT IS IN
ACCORD WITH PROGRESS MERITS THE APPLAUSE OF THE PEOPLE BUT A HEROIC
DEFEAT MERITS THEIR TENDER COMPASSION
THE ONE IS MAGNIFICENT THE OTHER
SUBLIME
FOR OUR OWN PART WE PREFER MARTYRDOM TO SUCCESS
JOHN BROWN IS
GREATER THAN WASHINGTON AND PISACANE IS GREATER THAN GARIBALDI
IT CERTAINLY IS NECESSARY THAT SOME ONE SHOULD TAKE THE PART OF THE
VANQUISHED
WE ARE UNJUST TOWARDS THESE GREAT MEN WHO ATTEMPT THE FUTURE WHEN THEY
FAIL
REVOLUTIONISTS ARE ACCUSED OF SOWING FEAR ABROAD
EVERY BARRICADE SEEMS
A CRIME
THEIR THEORIES ARE INCRIMINATED THEIR AIM SUSPECTED THEIR
ULTERIOR MOTIVE IS FEARED THEIR CONSCIENCE DENOUNCED
THEY ARE
REPROACHED WITH RAISING ERECTING AND HEAPING UP AGAINST THE REIGNING
SOCIAL STATE A MASS OF MISERIES OF GRIEFS OF INIQUITIES OF WRONGS
OF DESPAIRS AND OF TEARING FROM THE LOWEST DEPTHS BLOCKS OF SHADOW
IN ORDER THEREIN TO EMBATTLE THEMSELVES AND TO COMBAT
PEOPLE SHOUT
TO THEM YOU ARE TEARING UP THE PAVEMENTS OF HELL THEY MIGHT REPLY
THAT IS BECAUSE OUR BARRICADE IS MADE OF GOOD INTENTIONS
THE BEST THING ASSUREDLY IS THE PACIFIC SOLUTION
IN SHORT LET US
AGREE THAT WHEN WE BEHOLD THE PAVEMENT WE THINK OF THE BEAR AND IT IS
A GOOD WILL WHICH RENDERS SOCIETY UNEASY
BUT IT DEPENDS ON SOCIETY
TO SAVE ITSELF IT IS TO ITS OWN GOOD WILL THAT WE MAKE OUR APPEAL
NO VIOLENT REMEDY IS NECESSARY
TO STUDY EVIL AMIABLY TO PROVE ITS
EXISTENCE THEN TO CURE IT
IT IS TO THIS THAT WE INVITE IT
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE EVEN WHEN FALLEN ABOVE ALL WHEN FALLEN THESE MEN
WHO AT EVERY POINT OF THE UNIVERSE WITH THEIR EYES FIXED ON FRANCE ARE
STRIVING FOR THE GRAND WORK WITH THE INFLEXIBLE LOGIC OF THE IDEAL
ARE AUGUST THEY GIVE THEIR LIFE A FREE OFFERING TO PROGRESS THEY
ACCOMPLISH THE WILL OF PROVIDENCE THEY PERFORM A RELIGIOUS ACT
AT THE
APPOINTED HOUR WITH AS MUCH DISINTERESTEDNESS AS AN ACTOR WHO ANSWERS
TO HIS CUE IN OBEDIENCE TO THE DIVINE STAGE MANAGER THEY ENTER THE
TOMB
AND THIS HOPELESS COMBAT THIS STOICAL DISAPPEARANCE THEY ACCEPT
IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT THE SUPREME AND UNIVERSAL CONSEQUENCES THE
MAGNIFICENT AND IRRESISTIBLY HUMAN MOVEMENT BEGUN ON THE 14TH OF JULY
1789 THESE SOLDIERS ARE PRIESTS
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION IS AN ACT OF
GOD
MOREOVER THERE ARE AND IT IS PROPER TO ADD THIS DISTINCTION TO THE
DISTINCTIONS ALREADY POINTED OUT IN ANOTHER CHAPTER THERE ARE ACCEPTED
REVOLUTIONS REVOLUTIONS WHICH ARE CALLED REVOLUTIONS THERE ARE REFUSED
REVOLUTIONS WHICH ARE CALLED RIOTS
AN INSURRECTION WHICH BREAKS OUT IS AN IDEA WHICH IS PASSING ITS
EXAMINATION BEFORE THE PEOPLE
IF THE PEOPLE LETS FALL A BLACK BALL THE
IDEA IS DRIED FRUIT THE INSURRECTION IS A MERE SKIRMISH
WAGING WAR AT EVERY SUMMONS AND EVERY TIME THAT UTOPIA DESIRES IT IS
NOT THE THING FOR THE PEOPLES
NATIONS HAVE NOT ALWAYS AND AT EVERY HOUR
THE TEMPERAMENT OF HEROES AND MARTYRS
THEY ARE POSITIVE
A PRIORI INSURRECTION IS REPUGNANT TO THEM IN THE
FIRST PLACE BECAUSE IT OFTEN RESULTS IN A CATASTROPHE IN THE SECOND
PLACE BECAUSE IT ALWAYS HAS AN ABSTRACTION AS ITS POINT OF DEPARTURE
BECAUSE AND THIS IS A NOBLE THING IT IS ALWAYS FOR THE IDEAL AND FOR
THE IDEAL ALONE THAT THOSE WHO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES DO THUS SACRIFICE
THEMSELVES
AN INSURRECTION IS AN ENTHUSIASM
ENTHUSIASM MAY WAX WROTH
HENCE THE APPEAL TO ARMS
BUT EVERY INSURRECTION WHICH AIMS AT A
GOVERNMENT OR A REGIME AIMS HIGHER
THUS FOR INSTANCE AND WE
INSIST UPON IT WHAT THE CHIEFS OF THE INSURRECTION OF 1832 AND IN
PARTICULAR THE YOUNG ENTHUSIASTS OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE WERE
COMBATING WAS NOT PRECISELY LOUIS PHILIPPE
THE MAJORITY OF THEM
WHEN TALKING FREELY DID JUSTICE TO THIS KING WHO STOOD MIDWAY BETWEEN
MONARCHY AND REVOLUTION NO ONE HATED HIM
BUT THEY ATTACKED THE YOUNGER
BRANCH OF THE DIVINE RIGHT IN LOUIS PHILIPPE AS THEY HAD ATTACKED ITS
ELDER BRANCH IN CHARLES X AND THAT WHICH THEY WISHED TO OVERTURN IN
OVERTURNING ROYALTY IN FRANCE WAS AS WE HAVE EXPLAINED THE USURPATION
OF MAN OVER MAN AND OF PRIVILEGE OVER RIGHT IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE
PARIS WITHOUT A KING HAS AS RESULT THE WORLD WITHOUT DESPOTS
THIS IS
THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY REASONED
THEIR AIM WAS DISTANT NO DOUBT
VAGUE PERHAPS AND IT RETREATED IN THE FACE OF THEIR EFFORTS BUT IT WAS
GREAT
THUS IT IS
AND WE SACRIFICE OURSELVES FOR THESE VISIONS WHICH ARE
ALMOST ALWAYS ILLUSIONS FOR THE SACRIFICED BUT ILLUSIONS WITH WHICH
AFTER ALL THE WHOLE OF HUMAN CERTAINTY IS MINGLED
WE THROW OURSELVES
INTO THESE TRAGIC AFFAIRS AND BECOME INTOXICATED WITH THAT WHICH WE ARE
ABOUT TO DO
WHO KNOWS WE MAY SUCCEED
WE ARE FEW IN NUMBER WE HAVE A
WHOLE ARMY ARRAYED AGAINST US BUT WE ARE DEFENDING RIGHT THE NATURAL
LAW THE SOVEREIGNTY OF EACH ONE OVER HIMSELF FROM WHICH NO ABDICATION
IS POSSIBLE JUSTICE AND TRUTH AND IN CASE OF NEED WE DIE LIKE THE
THREE HUNDRED SPARTANS
WE DO NOT THINK OF DON QUIXOTE BUT OF LEONIDAS
AND WE MARCH STRAIGHT BEFORE US AND ONCE PLEDGED WE DO NOT DRAW
BACK AND WE RUSH ONWARDS WITH HEAD HELD LOW CHERISHING AS OUR HOPE AN
UNPRECEDENTED VICTORY REVOLUTION COMPLETED PROGRESS SET FREE AGAIN
THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF THE HUMAN RACE UNIVERSAL DELIVERANCE AND IN THE
EVENT OF THE WORST THERMOPYLAE
THESE PASSAGES OF ARMS FOR THE SAKE OF PROGRESS OFTEN SUFFER SHIPWRECK
AND WE HAVE JUST EXPLAINED WHY
THE CROWD IS RESTIVE IN THE PRESENCE OF
THE IMPULSES OF PALADINS
HEAVY MASSES THE MULTITUDES WHICH ARE FRAGILE
BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY WEIGHT FEAR ADVENTURES AND THERE IS A TOUCH OF
ADVENTURE IN THE IDEAL
MOREOVER AND WE MUST NOT FORGET THIS INTERESTS WHICH ARE NOT VERY
FRIENDLY TO THE IDEAL AND THE SENTIMENTAL ARE IN THE WAY
SOMETIMES THE
STOMACH PARALYZES THE HEART
THE GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY OF FRANCE LIES IN THIS THAT SHE TAKES LESS FROM
THE STOMACH THAN OTHER NATIONS SHE MORE EASILY KNOTS THE ROPE ABOUT HER
LOINS
SHE IS THE FIRST AWAKE THE LAST ASLEEP
SHE MARCHES FORWARDS
SHE IS A SEEKER
THIS ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT SHE IS AN ARTIST
THE IDEAL IS NOTHING BUT THE CULMINATING POINT OF LOGIC THE SAME AS THE
BEAUTIFUL IS NOTHING BUT THE SUMMIT OF THE TRUE
ARTISTIC PEOPLES ARE
ALSO CONSISTENT PEOPLES
TO LOVE BEAUTY IS TO SEE THE LIGHT
THAT IS WHY
THE TORCH OF EUROPE THAT IS TO SAY OF CIVILIZATION WAS FIRST BORNE BY
GREECE WHO PASSED IT ON TO ITALY WHO HANDED IT ON TO FRANCE
DIVINE
ILLUMINATING NATIONS OF SCOUTS VITAELAMPADA TRADUNT
IT IS AN ADMIRABLE THING THAT THE POETRY OF A PEOPLE IS THE ELEMENT OF
ITS PROGRESS
THE AMOUNT OF CIVILIZATION IS MEASURED BY THE QUANTITY
OF IMAGINATION
ONLY A CIVILIZING PEOPLE SHOULD REMAIN A MANLY PEOPLE
CORINTH YES SYBARIS NO
WHOEVER BECOMES EFFEMINATE MAKES HIMSELF A
BASTARD
HE MUST BE NEITHER A DILETTANTE NOR A VIRTUOSO BUT HE MUST BE
ARTISTIC
IN THE MATTER OF CIVILIZATION HE MUST NOT REFINE BUT HE MUST
SUBLIME
ON THIS CONDITION ONE GIVES TO THE HUMAN RACE THE PATTERN OF
THE IDEAL
THE MODERN IDEAL HAS ITS TYPE IN ART AND ITS MEANS IS SCIENCE
IT IS
THROUGH SCIENCE THAT IT WILL REALIZE THAT AUGUST VISION OF THE POETS
THE SOCIALLY BEAUTIFUL
EDEN WILL BE RECONSTRUCTED BY A B
AT THE POINT
WHICH CIVILIZATION HAS NOW REACHED THE EXACT IS A NECESSARY ELEMENT
OF THE SPLENDID AND THE ARTISTIC SENTIMENT IS NOT ONLY SERVED BUT
COMPLETED BY THE SCIENTIFIC ORGAN DREAMS MUST BE CALCULATED
ART WHICH
IS THE CONQUEROR SHOULD HAVE FOR SUPPORT SCIENCE WHICH IS THE WALKER
THE SOLIDITY OF THE CREATURE WHICH IS RIDDEN IS OF IMPORTANCE
THE
MODERN SPIRIT IS THE GENIUS OF GREECE WITH THE GENIUS OF INDIA AS ITS
VEHICLE ALEXANDER ON THE ELEPHANT
RACES WHICH ARE PETRIFIED IN DOGMA OR DEMORALIZED BY LUCRE ARE UNFIT TO
GUIDE CIVILIZATION
GENUFLECTION BEFORE THE IDOL OR BEFORE MONEY WASTES
AWAY THE MUSCLES WHICH WALK AND THE WILL WHICH ADVANCES
HIERATIC OR
MERCANTILE ABSORPTION LESSENS A PEOPLE'S POWER OF RADIANCE LOWERS ITS
HORIZON BY LOWERING ITS LEVEL AND DEPRIVES IT OF THAT INTELLIGENCE
AT ONCE BOTH HUMAN AND DIVINE OF THE UNIVERSAL GOAL WHICH MAKES
MISSIONARIES OF NATIONS
BABYLON HAS NO IDEAL CARTHAGE HAS NO IDEAL
ATHENS AND ROME HAVE AND KEEP THROUGHOUT ALL THE NOCTURNAL DARKNESS OF
THE CENTURIES HALOS OF CIVILIZATION
FRANCE IS IN THE SAME QUALITY OF RACE AS GREECE AND ITALY
SHE IS
ATHENIAN IN THE MATTER OF BEAUTY AND ROMAN IN HER GREATNESS
MOREOVER
SHE IS GOOD
SHE GIVES HERSELF
OFTENER THAN IS THE CASE WITH OTHER
RACES IS SHE IN THE HUMOR FOR SELF DEVOTION AND SACRIFICE
ONLY THIS
HUMOR SEIZES UPON HER AND AGAIN ABANDONS HER
AND THEREIN LIES THE
GREAT PERIL FOR THOSE WHO RUN WHEN SHE DESIRES ONLY TO WALK OR WHO WALK
ON WHEN SHE DESIRES TO HALT
FRANCE HAS HER RELAPSES INTO MATERIALISM
AND AT CERTAIN INSTANTS THE IDEAS WHICH OBSTRUCT THAT SUBLIME BRAIN
HAVE NO LONGER ANYTHING WHICH RECALLS FRENCH GREATNESS AND ARE OF THE
DIMENSIONS OF A MISSOURI OR A SOUTH CAROLINA
WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN
SUCH A CASE THE GIANTESS PLAYS AT BEING A DWARF IMMENSE FRANCE HAS HER
FREAKS OF PETTINESS
THAT IS ALL
TO THIS THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY
PEOPLES LIKE PLANETS POSSESS THE
RIGHT TO AN ECLIPSE
AND ALL IS WELL PROVIDED THAT THE LIGHT
RETURNS AND THAT THE ECLIPSE DOES NOT DEGENERATE INTO NIGHT
DAWN AND
RESURRECTION ARE SYNONYMOUS
THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE LIGHT IS IDENTICAL
WITH THE PERSISTENCE OF THE I
LET US STATE THESE FACTS CALMLY
DEATH ON THE BARRICADE OR THE TOMB IN
EXILE IS AN ACCEPTABLE OCCASION FOR DEVOTION
THE REAL NAME OF
DEVOTION IS DISINTERESTEDNESS
LET THE ABANDONED ALLOW THEMSELVES TO
BE ABANDONED LET THE EXILED ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE EXILED AND LET US
CONFINE OURSELVES TO ENTREATING GREAT NATIONS NOT TO RETREAT TOO FAR
WHEN THEY DO RETREAT
ONE MUST NOT PUSH TOO FAR IN DESCENT UNDER PRETEXT
OF A RETURN TO REASON
MATTER EXISTS THE MINUTE EXISTS INTEREST EXISTS THE STOMACH EXISTS
BUT THE STOMACH MUST NOT BE THE SOLE WISDOM
THE LIFE OF THE MOMENT HAS
ITS RIGHTS WE ADMIT BUT PERMANENT LIFE HAS ITS RIGHTS ALSO
ALAS THE
FACT THAT ONE IS MOUNTED DOES NOT PRECLUDE A FALL
THIS CAN BE SEEN IN
HISTORY MORE FREQUENTLY THAN IS DESIRABLE A NATION IS GREAT IT TASTES
THE IDEAL THEN IT BITES THE MIRE AND FINDS IT GOOD AND IF IT BE ASKED
HOW IT HAPPENS THAT IT HAS ABANDONED SOCRATES FOR FALSTAFF IT REPLIES
BECAUSE I LOVE STATESMEN
ONE WORD MORE BEFORE RETURNING TO OUR SUBJECT THE CONFLICT
A BATTLE LIKE THE ONE WHICH WE ARE ENGAGED IN DESCRIBING IS NOTHING ELSE
THAN A CONVULSION TOWARDS THE IDEAL
PROGRESS TRAMMELLED IS SICKLY AND
IS SUBJECT TO THESE TRAGIC EPILEPSIES
WITH THAT MALADY OF PROGRESS
CIVIL WAR WE HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO COME IN CONTACT IN OUR PASSAGE
THIS
IS ONE OF THE FATAL PHASES AT ONCE ACT AND ENTR'ACTE OF THAT DRAMA
WHOSE PIVOT IS A SOCIAL CONDEMNATION AND WHOSE VERITABLE TITLE IS
PROGRESS
PROGRESS
THE CRY TO WHICH WE FREQUENTLY GIVE UTTERANCE IS OUR WHOLE THOUGHT AND
AT THE POINT OF THIS DRAMA WHICH WE HAVE NOW REACHED THE IDEA WHICH IT
CONTAINS HAVING STILL MORE THAN ONE TRIAL TO UNDERGO IT IS PERHAPS
PERMITTED TO US IF NOT TO LIFT THE VEIL FROM IT TO AT LEAST ALLOW ITS
LIGHT TO SHINE THROUGH
THE BOOK WHICH THE READER HAS UNDER HIS EYE AT THIS MOMENT IS FROM
ONE END TO THE OTHER AS A WHOLE AND IN DETAIL WHATEVER MAY BE ITS
INTERMITTENCES EXCEPTIONS AND FAULTS THE MARCH FROM EVIL TO GOOD FROM
THE UNJUST TO THE JUST FROM NIGHT TO DAY FROM APPETITE TO CONSCIENCE
FROM ROTTENNESS TO LIFE FROM HELL TO HEAVEN FROM NOTHINGNESS TO GOD
POINT OF DEPARTURE MATTER POINT OF ARRIVAL THE SOUL
THE HYDRA AT THE
BEGINNING THE ANGEL AT THE END
CHAPTER XXI THE HEROES
ALL AT ONCE THE DRUM BEAT THE CHARGE
THE ATTACK WAS A HURRICANE
ON THE EVENING BEFORE IN THE DARKNESS
THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN APPROACHED SILENTLY AS BY A BOA
NOW IN BROAD
DAYLIGHT IN THAT WIDENING STREET SURPRISE WAS DECIDEDLY IMPOSSIBLE
RUDE FORCE HAD MOREOVER BEEN UNMASKED THE CANNON HAD BEGUN THE
ROAR THE ARMY HURLED ITSELF ON THE BARRICADE
FURY NOW BECAME SKILL
A POWERFUL DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY OF THE LINE BROKEN AT REGULAR
INTERVALS BY THE NATIONAL GUARD AND THE MUNICIPAL GUARD ON FOOT
AND SUPPORTED BY SERRIED MASSES WHICH COULD BE HEARD THOUGH NOT SEEN
DEBAUCHED INTO THE STREET AT A RUN WITH DRUMS BEATING TRUMPETS
BRAYING BAYONETS LEVELLED THE SAPPERS AT THEIR HEAD AND
IMPERTURBABLE UNDER THE PROJECTILES CHARGED STRAIGHT FOR THE BARRICADE
WITH THE WEIGHT OF A BRAZEN BEAM AGAINST A WALL
THE WALL HELD FIRM
THE INSURGENTS FIRED IMPETUOUSLY
THE BARRICADE ONCE SCALED HAD A MANE
OF LIGHTNING FLASHES
THE ASSAULT WAS SO FURIOUS THAT FOR ONE MOMENT
IT WAS INUNDATED WITH ASSAILANTS BUT IT SHOOK OFF THE SOLDIERS AS THE
LION SHAKES OFF THE DOGS AND IT WAS ONLY COVERED WITH BESIEGERS AS
THE CLIFF IS COVERED WITH FOAM TO RE APPEAR A MOMENT LATER BEETLING
BLACK AND FORMIDABLE
THE COLUMN FORCED TO RETREAT REMAINED MASSED IN THE STREET
UNPROTECTED BUT TERRIBLE AND REPLIED TO THE REDOUBT WITH A TERRIBLE
DISCHARGE OF MUSKETRY
ANY ONE WHO HAS SEEN FIREWORKS WILL RECALL THE
SHEAF FORMED OF INTERLACING LIGHTNINGS WHICH IS CALLED A BOUQUET
LET
THE READER PICTURE TO HIMSELF THIS BOUQUET NO LONGER VERTICAL BUT
HORIZONTAL BEARING A BULLET BUCK SHOT OR A BISCAIEN AT THE TIP OF EACH
ONE OF ITS JETS OF FLAME AND PICKING OFF DEAD MEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER
FROM ITS CLUSTERS OF LIGHTNING
THE BARRICADE WAS UNDERNEATH IT
ON BOTH SIDES THE RESOLUTION WAS EQUAL
THE BRAVERY EXHIBITED THERE
WAS ALMOST BARBAROUS AND WAS COMPLICATED WITH A SORT OF HEROIC FEROCITY
WHICH BEGAN BY THE SACRIFICE OF SELF
THIS WAS THE EPOCH WHEN A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN FOUGHT LIKE A ZOUAVE
THE TROOP WISHED TO MAKE AN END OF IT INSURRECTION WAS DESIROUS OF
FIGHTING
THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE DEATH AGONY IN THE FLOWER OF YOUTH AND
IN THE FLUSH OF HEALTH TURNS INTREPIDITY INTO FRENZY
IN THIS FRAY EACH
ONE UNDERWENT THE BROADENING GROWTH OF THE DEATH HOUR
THE STREET WAS
STREWN WITH CORPSES
THE BARRICADE HAD ENJOLRAS AT ONE OF ITS EXTREMITIES AND MARIUS AT THE
OTHER
ENJOLRAS WHO CARRIED THE WHOLE BARRICADE IN HIS HEAD RESERVED
AND SHELTERED HIMSELF THREE SOLDIERS FELL ONE AFTER THE OTHER UNDER
HIS EMBRASURE WITHOUT HAVING EVEN SEEN HIM MARIUS FOUGHT UNPROTECTED
HE MADE HIMSELF A TARGET
HE STOOD WITH MORE THAN HALF HIS BODY ABOVE
THE BREASTWORKS
THERE IS NO MORE VIOLENT PRODIGAL THAN THE AVARICIOUS
MAN WHO TAKES THE BIT IN HIS TEETH THERE IS NO MAN MORE TERRIBLE IN
ACTION THAN A DREAMER
MARIUS WAS FORMIDABLE AND PENSIVE
IN BATTLE HE
WAS AS IN A DREAM
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HIM A PHANTOM ENGAGED IN
FIRING A GUN
THE INSURGENTS' CARTRIDGES WERE GIVING OUT BUT NOT THEIR SARCASMS
IN
THIS WHIRLWIND OF THE SEPULCHRE IN WHICH THEY STOOD THEY LAUGHED
COURFEYRAC WAS BARE HEADED
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOUR HAT BOSSUET ASKED HIM
COURFEYRAC REPLIED
THEY HAVE FINALLY TAKEN IT AWAY FROM ME WITH CANNON BALLS
OR THEY UTTERED HAUGHTY COMMENTS
CAN ANY ONE UNDERSTAND EXCLAIMED FEUILLY BITTERLY THOSE MEN AND
HE CITED NAMES WELL KNOWN NAMES EVEN CELEBRATED NAMES SOME BELONGING
TO THE OLD ARMY WHO HAD PROMISED TO JOIN US AND TAKEN AN OATH TO AID
US AND WHO HAD PLEDGED THEIR HONOR TO IT AND WHO ARE OUR GENERALS AND
WHO ABANDON US
AND COMBEFERRE RESTRICTED HIMSELF TO REPLYING WITH A GRAVE SMILE
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO OBSERVE THE RULES OF HONOR AS ONE OBSERVES THE
STARS FROM A GREAT DISTANCE
THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE WAS SO STREWN WITH TORN CARTRIDGES THAT
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN A SNOWSTORM
THE ASSAILANTS HAD NUMBERS IN THEIR FAVOR THE INSURGENTS HAD POSITION
THEY WERE AT THE TOP OF A WALL AND THEY THUNDERED POINT BLANK UPON
THE SOLDIERS TRIPPING OVER THE DEAD AND WOUNDED AND ENTANGLED IN
THE ESCARPMENT
THIS BARRICADE CONSTRUCTED AS IT WAS AND ADMIRABLY
BUTTRESSED WAS REALLY ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE A HANDFUL OF MEN
HOLD A LEGION IN CHECK
NEVERTHELESS THE ATTACKING COLUMN CONSTANTLY
RECRUITED AND ENLARGED UNDER THE SHOWER OF BULLETS DREW INEXORABLY
NEARER AND NOW LITTLE BY LITTLE STEP BY STEP BUT SURELY THE ARMY
CLOSED IN AROUND THE BARRICADE AS THE VICE GRASPS THE WINE PRESS
ONE ASSAULT FOLLOWED ANOTHER
THE HORROR OF THE SITUATION KEPT
INCREASING
THEN THERE BURST FORTH ON THAT HEAP OF PAVING STONES IN THAT RUE DE LA
CHANVRERIE A BATTLE WORTHY OF A WALL OF TROY
THESE HAGGARD RAGGED
EXHAUSTED MEN WHO HAD HAD NOTHING TO EAT FOR FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS WHO
HAD NOT SLEPT WHO HAD BUT A FEW MORE ROUNDS TO FIRE WHO WERE FUMBLING
IN THEIR POCKETS WHICH HAD BEEN EMPTIED OF CARTRIDGES NEARLY ALL
OF WHOM WERE WOUNDED WITH HEAD OR ARM BANDAGED WITH BLACK AND
BLOOD STAINED LINEN WITH HOLES IN THEIR CLOTHES FROM WHICH THE BLOOD
TRICKLED AND WHO WERE HARDLY ARMED WITH POOR GUNS AND NOTCHED SWORDS
BECAME TITANS
THE BARRICADE WAS TEN TIMES ATTACKED APPROACHED
ASSAILED SCALED AND NEVER CAPTURED
IN ORDER TO FORM AN IDEA OF THIS STRUGGLE IT IS NECESSARY TO IMAGINE
FIRE SET TO A THRONG OF TERRIBLE COURAGES AND THEN TO GAZE AT THE
CONFLAGRATION
IT WAS NOT A COMBAT IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF A FURNACE
THERE MOUTHS BREATHED THE FLAME THERE COUNTENANCES WERE EXTRAORDINARY
THE HUMAN FORM SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THERE THE COMBATANTS FLAMED FORTH
THERE AND IT WAS FORMIDABLE TO BEHOLD THE GOING AND COMING IN THAT RED
GLOW OF THOSE SALAMANDERS OF THE FRAY
THE SUCCESSIVE AND SIMULTANEOUS SCENES OF THIS GRAND SLAUGHTER WE
RENOUNCE ALL ATTEMPTS AT DEPICTING
THE EPIC ALONE HAS THE RIGHT TO FILL
TWELVE THOUSAND VERSES WITH A BATTLE
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED THIS THAT HELL OF BRAHMANISM THE MOST
REDOUBTABLE OF THE SEVENTEEN ABYSSES WHICH THE VEDA CALLS THE FOREST OF
SWORDS
THEY FOUGHT HAND TO HAND FOOT TO FOOT WITH PISTOL SHOTS WITH BLOWS OF
THE SWORD WITH THEIR FISTS AT A DISTANCE CLOSE AT HAND FROM ABOVE
FROM BELOW FROM EVERYWHERE FROM THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES FROM THE
WINDOWS OF THE WINE SHOP FROM THE CELLAR WINDOWS WHITHER SOME HAD
CRAWLED
THEY WERE ONE AGAINST SIXTY
THE FACADE OF CORINTHE HALF DEMOLISHED WAS HIDEOUS
THE WINDOW
TATTOOED WITH GRAPE SHOT HAD LOST GLASS AND FRAME AND WAS NOTHING NOW
BUT A SHAPELESS HOLE TUMULTUOUSLY BLOCKED WITH PAVING STONES
BOSSUET WAS KILLED FEUILLY WAS KILLED COURFEYRAC WAS KILLED
COMBEFERRE TRANSFIXED BY THREE BLOWS FROM A BAYONET IN THE BREAST AT
THE MOMENT WHEN HE WAS LIFTING UP A WOUNDED SOLDIER HAD ONLY TIME TO
CAST A GLANCE TO HEAVEN WHEN HE EXPIRED
MARIUS STILL FIGHTING WAS SO RIDDLED WITH WOUNDS PARTICULARLY IN THE
HEAD THAT HIS COUNTENANCE DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE BLOOD AND ONE WOULD
HAVE SAID THAT HIS FACE WAS COVERED WITH A RED KERCHIEF
ENJOLRAS ALONE WAS NOT STRUCK
WHEN HE HAD NO LONGER ANY WEAPON HE
REACHED OUT HIS HANDS TO RIGHT AND LEFT AND AN INSURGENT THRUST SOME ARM
OR OTHER INTO HIS FIST
ALL HE HAD LEFT WAS THE STUMPS OF FOUR SWORDS
ONE MORE THAN FRANCOIS I
AT MARIGNAN
HOMER SAYS DIOMEDES CUTS

EURYALUS SON OF MECISTAEUS EXTERMINATES DRESOS AND OPHELTIOS

FRESCOES SHOW US THE TWO DUKES OF BRETAGNE AND BOURBON ARMED
EMBLAZONED AND CRESTED IN WAR LIKE GUISE ON HORSEBACK AND APPROACHING

IRON BOOTED WITH IRON THE ONE CAPARISONED IN ERMINE THE OTHER DRAPED
IN AZURE BRETAGNE WITH HIS LION BETWEEN THE TWO HORNS OF HIS CROWN
BOURBON HELMETED WITH A MONSTER FLEUR DE LYS ON HIS VISOR
BUT IN ORDER
TO BE SUPERB IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO WEAR LIKE YVON THE DUCAL MORION
TO HAVE IN THE FIST LIKE ESPLANDIAN A LIVING FLAME OR LIKE PHYLES
FATHER OF POLYDAMAS TO HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM EPHYRA A GOOD SUIT OF
MAIL A PRESENT FROM THE KING OF MEN EUPHETES IT SUFFICES TO GIVE
ONE'S LIFE FOR A CONVICTION OR A LOYALTY

A BLOND YOUTH WHO SHAVES HIS BEARD WITH SCISSORS TAKE BOTH OF THEM
BREATHE UPON THEM WITH A BREATH OF DUTY PLACE THEM FACE TO FACE IN THE
CARREFOUR BOUCHERAT OR IN THE BLIND ALLEY PLANCHE MIBRAY AND LET THE
ONE FIGHT FOR HIS FLAG AND THE OTHER FOR HIS IDEAL AND LET BOTH OF
THEM IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR COUNTRY THE STRUGGLE WILL
BE COLOSSAL AND THE SHADOW WHICH THIS RAW RECRUIT AND THIS SAWBONES
IN CONFLICT WILL PRODUCE IN THAT GRAND EPIC FIELD WHERE HUMANITY
IS STRIVING WILL EQUAL THE SHADOW CAST BY MEGARYON KING OF LYCIA
TIGER FILLED CRUSHING IN HIS EMBRACE THE IMMENSE BODY OF AJAX EQUAL TO
THE GODS
CHAPTER XXII FOOT TO FOOT
WHEN THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY OF THE LEADERS LEFT ALIVE EXCEPT ENJOLRAS
AND MARIUS AT THE TWO EXTREMITIES OF THE BARRICADE THE CENTRE WHICH
HAD SO LONG SUSTAINED COURFEYRAC JOLY BOSSUET FEUILLY AND COMBEFERRE
GAVE WAY
THE CANNON THOUGH IT HAD NOT EFFECTED A PRACTICABLE BREACH
HAD MADE A RATHER LARGE HOLLOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REDOUBT THERE THE
SUMMIT OF THE WALL HAD DISAPPEARED BEFORE THE BALLS AND HAD CRUMBLED
AWAY AND THE RUBBISH WHICH HAD FALLEN NOW INSIDE NOW OUTSIDE HAD
AS IT ACCUMULATED FORMED TWO PILES IN THE NATURE OF SLOPES ON THE TWO
SIDES OF THE BARRIER ONE ON THE INSIDE THE OTHER ON THE OUTSIDE
THE
EXTERIOR SLOPE PRESENTED AN INCLINED PLANE TO THE ATTACK
A FINAL ASSAULT WAS THERE ATTEMPTED AND THIS ASSAULT SUCCEEDED
THE
MASS BRISTLING WITH BAYONETS AND HURLED FORWARD AT A RUN CAME UP WITH
IRRESISTIBLE FORCE AND THE SERRIED FRONT OF BATTLE OF THE ATTACKING
COLUMN MADE ITS APPEARANCE THROUGH THE SMOKE ON THE CREST OF THE
BATTLEMENTS
THIS TIME IT WAS DECISIVE
THE GROUP OF INSURGENTS WHO
WERE DEFENDING THE CENTRE RETREATED IN CONFUSION
THEN THE GLOOMY LOVE OF LIFE AWOKE ONCE MORE IN SOME OF THEM
MANY
FINDING THEMSELVES UNDER THE MUZZLES OF THIS FOREST OF GUNS DID NOT
WISH TO DIE
THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN THE INSTINCT OF SELF PRESERVATION
EMITS HOWLS WHEN THE BEAST RE APPEARS IN MEN
THEY WERE HEMMED IN BY
THE LOFTY SIX STORY HOUSE WHICH FORMED THE BACKGROUND OF THEIR REDOUBT
THIS HOUSE MIGHT PROVE THEIR SALVATION
THE BUILDING WAS BARRICADED AND
WALLED AS IT WERE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
BEFORE THE TROOPS OF THE LINE
HAD REACHED THE INTERIOR OF THE REDOUBT THERE WAS TIME FOR A DOOR TO
OPEN AND SHUT THE SPACE OF A FLASH OF LIGHTNING WAS SUFFICIENT FOR
THAT AND THE DOOR OF THAT HOUSE SUDDENLY OPENED A CRACK AND CLOSED
AGAIN INSTANTLY WAS LIFE FOR THESE DESPAIRING MEN
BEHIND THIS HOUSE
THERE WERE STREETS POSSIBLE FLIGHT SPACE
THEY SET TO KNOCKING AT THAT
DOOR WITH THE BUTTS OF THEIR GUNS AND WITH KICKS SHOUTING CALLING
ENTREATING WRINGING THEIR HANDS
NO ONE OPENED
FROM THE LITTLE WINDOW
ON THE THIRD FLOOR THE HEAD OF THE DEAD MAN GAZED DOWN UPON THEM
BUT ENJOLRAS AND MARIUS AND THE SEVEN OR EIGHT RALLIED ABOUT THEM
SPRANG FORWARD AND PROTECTED THEM
ENJOLRAS HAD SHOUTED TO THE SOLDIERS
DON'T ADVANCE AND AS AN OFFICER HAD NOT OBEYED ENJOLRAS HAD KILLED
THE OFFICER
HE WAS NOW IN THE LITTLE INNER COURT OF THE REDOUBT WITH
HIS BACK PLANTED AGAINST THE CORINTHE BUILDING A SWORD IN ONE HAND
A RIFLE IN THE OTHER HOLDING OPEN THE DOOR OF THE WINE SHOP WHICH HE
BARRED AGAINST ASSAILANTS
HE SHOUTED TO THE DESPERATE MEN THERE IS
BUT ONE DOOR OPEN THIS ONE AND SHIELDING THEM WITH HIS BODY AND
FACING AN ENTIRE BATTALION ALONE HE MADE THEM PASS IN BEHIND HIM
ALL
PRECIPITATED THEMSELVES THITHER
ENJOLRAS EXECUTING WITH HIS RIFLE
WHICH HE NOW USED LIKE A CANE WHAT SINGLE STICK PLAYERS CALL A COVERED
ROSE ROUND HIS HEAD LEVELLED THE BAYONETS AROUND AND IN FRONT OF HIM
AND WAS THE LAST TO ENTER AND THEN ENSUED A HORRIBLE MOMENT WHEN THE
SOLDIERS TRIED TO MAKE THEIR WAY IN AND THE INSURGENTS STROVE TO BAR
THEM OUT
THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT AS IT FELL BACK
INTO ITS FRAME IT SHOWED THE FIVE FINGERS OF A SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN
CLINGING TO IT CUT OFF AND GLUED TO THE POST
MARIUS REMAINED OUTSIDE
A SHOT HAD JUST BROKEN HIS COLLAR BONE HE
FELT THAT HE WAS FAINTING AND FALLING
AT THAT MOMENT WITH EYES ALREADY
SHUT HE FELT THE SHOCK OF A VIGOROUS HAND SEIZING HIM AND THE SWOON
IN WHICH HIS SENSES VANISHED HARDLY ALLOWED HIM TIME FOR THE THOUGHT
MINGLED WITH A LAST MEMORY OF COSETTE I AM TAKEN PRISONER
I SHALL BE
SHOT
ENJOLRAS NOT SEEING MARIUS AMONG THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE
WINE SHOP HAD THE SAME IDEA
BUT THEY HAD REACHED A MOMENT WHEN EACH
MAN HAS NOT THE TIME TO MEDITATE ON HIS OWN DEATH
ENJOLRAS FIXED THE
BAR ACROSS THE DOOR AND BOLTED IT AND DOUBLE LOCKED IT WITH KEY AND
CHAIN WHILE THOSE OUTSIDE WERE BATTERING FURIOUSLY AT IT THE SOLDIERS
WITH THE BUTTS OF THEIR MUSKETS THE SAPPERS WITH THEIR AXES
THE
ASSAILANTS WERE GROUPED ABOUT THAT DOOR
THE SIEGE OF THE WINE SHOP WAS
NOW BEGINNING
THE SOLDIERS WE WILL OBSERVE WERE FULL OF WRATH
THE DEATH OF THE ARTILLERY SERGEANT HAD ENRAGED THEM AND THEN A STILL
MORE MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE
DURING THE FEW HOURS WHICH HAD PRECEDED
THE ATTACK IT HAD BEEN REPORTED AMONG THEM THAT THE INSURGENTS WERE
MUTILATING THEIR PRISONERS AND THAT THERE WAS THE HEADLESS BODY OF
A SOLDIER IN THE WINE SHOP
THIS SORT OF FATAL RUMOR IS THE USUAL
ACCOMPANIMENT OF CIVIL WARS AND IT WAS A FALSE REPORT OF THIS KIND
WHICH LATER ON PRODUCED THE CATASTROPHE OF THE RUE TRANSNONAIN
WHEN THE DOOR WAS BARRICADED ENJOLRAS SAID TO THE OTHERS
LET US SELL OUR LIVES DEARLY
THEN HE APPROACHED THE TABLE ON WHICH LAY MABEUF AND GAVROCHE
BENEATH
THE BLACK CLOTH TWO STRAIGHT AND RIGID FORMS WERE VISIBLE ONE LARGE
THE OTHER SMALL AND THE TWO FACES WERE VAGUELY OUTLINED BENEATH THE
COLD FOLDS OF THE SHROUD
A HAND PROJECTED FROM BENEATH THE WINDING
SHEET AND HUNG NEAR THE FLOOR
IT WAS THAT OF THE OLD MAN
ENJOLRAS BENT DOWN AND KISSED THAT VENERABLE HAND JUST AS HE HAD KISSED
HIS BROW ON THE PRECEDING EVENING
THESE WERE THE ONLY TWO KISSES WHICH HE HAD BESTOWED IN THE COURSE OF
HIS LIFE
LET US ABRIDGE THE TALE
THE BARRICADE HAD FOUGHT LIKE A GATE OF THEBES
THE WINE SHOP FOUGHT LIKE A HOUSE OF SARAGOSSA
THESE RESISTANCES ARE
DOGGED
NO QUARTER
NO FLAG OF TRUCE POSSIBLE
MEN ARE WILLING TO DIE
PROVIDED THEIR OPPONENT WILL KILL THEM
WHEN SUCHET SAYS CAPITULATE PALAFOX REPLIES AFTER THE WAR WITH
CANNON THE WAR WITH KNIVES NOTHING WAS LACKING IN THE CAPTURE BY
ASSAULT OF THE HUCHELOUP WINE SHOP NEITHER PAVING STONES RAINING FROM
THE WINDOWS AND THE ROOF ON THE BESIEGERS AND EXASPERATING THE SOLDIERS
BY CRUSHING THEM HORRIBLY NOR SHOTS FIRED FROM THE ATTIC WINDOWS AND
THE CELLAR NOR THE FURY OF ATTACK NOR FINALLY WHEN THE DOOR YIELDED
THE FRENZIED MADNESS OF EXTERMINATION
THE ASSAILANTS RUSHING INTO THE
WINE SHOP THEIR FEET ENTANGLED IN THE PANELS OF THE DOOR WHICH HAD BEEN
BEATEN IN AND FLUNG ON THE GROUND FOUND NOT A SINGLE COMBATANT THERE
THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE HEWN ASUNDER WITH THE AXE LAY IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE TAP ROOM A FEW WOUNDED MEN WERE JUST BREATHING THEIR LAST EVERY
ONE WHO WAS NOT KILLED WAS ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND FROM THERE THROUGH
THE HOLE IN THE CEILING WHICH HAD FORMED THE ENTRANCE OF THE STAIRS
A TERRIFIC FIRE BURST FORTH
IT WAS THE LAST OF THEIR CARTRIDGES
WHEN
THEY WERE EXHAUSTED WHEN THESE FORMIDABLE MEN ON THE POINT OF DEATH HAD
NO LONGER EITHER POWDER OR BALL EACH GRASPED IN HIS HANDS TWO OF THE
BOTTLES WHICH ENJOLRAS HAD RESERVED AND OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN AND
HELD THE SCALING PARTY IN CHECK WITH THESE FRIGHTFULLY FRAGILE CLUBS
THEY WERE BOTTLES OF AQUAFORTIS
WE RELATE THESE GLOOMY INCIDENTS OF CARNAGE AS THEY OCCURRED
THE
BESIEGED MAN ALAS CONVERTS EVERYTHING INTO A WEAPON
GREEK FIRE DID
NOT DISGRACE ARCHIMEDES BOILING PITCH DID NOT DISGRACE BAYARD
ALL WAR
IS A THING OF TERROR AND THERE IS NO CHOICE IN IT
THE MUSKETRY OF THE
BESIEGERS THOUGH CONFINED AND EMBARRASSED BY BEING DIRECTED FROM BELOW
UPWARDS WAS DEADLY
THE RIM OF THE HOLE IN THE CEILING WAS SPEEDILY
SURROUNDED BY HEADS OF THE SLAIN WHENCE DRIPPED LONG RED AND SMOKING
STREAMS THE UPROAR WAS INDESCRIBABLE A CLOSE AND BURNING SMOKE ALMOST
PRODUCED NIGHT OVER THIS COMBAT
WORDS ARE LACKING TO EXPRESS HORROR
WHEN IT HAS REACHED THIS PITCH
THERE WERE NO LONGER MEN IN THIS
CONFLICT WHICH WAS NOW INFERNAL
THEY WERE NO LONGER GIANTS MATCHED
WITH COLOSSI
IT RESEMBLED MILTON AND DANTE RATHER THAN HOMER
DEMONS
ATTACKED SPECTRES RESISTED
IT WAS HEROISM BECOME MONSTROUS
CHAPTER XXIII ORESTES FASTING AND PYLADES DRUNK
AT LENGTH BY DINT OF MOUNTING ON EACH OTHER'S BACKS AIDING THEMSELVES
WITH THE SKELETON OF THE STAIRCASE CLIMBING UP THE WALLS CLINGING TO
THE CEILING SLASHING AWAY AT THE VERY BRINK OF THE TRAP DOOR THE LAST
ONE WHO OFFERED RESISTANCE A SCORE OF ASSAILANTS SOLDIERS NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN MUNICIPAL GUARDSMEN IN UTTER CONFUSION THE MAJORITY
DISFIGURED BY WOUNDS IN THE FACE DURING THAT REDOUBTABLE ASCENT BLINDED
BY BLOOD FURIOUS RENDERED SAVAGE MADE AN IRRUPTION INTO THE APARTMENT
ON THE FIRST FLOOR
THERE THEY FOUND ONLY ONE MAN STILL ON HIS FEET
ENJOLRAS
WITHOUT CARTRIDGES WITHOUT SWORD HE HAD NOTHING IN HIS HAND
NOW BUT THE BARREL OF HIS GUN WHOSE STOCK HE HAD BROKEN OVER THE HEAD
OF THOSE WHO WERE ENTERING
HE HAD PLACED THE BILLIARD TABLE BETWEEN HIS
ASSAILANTS AND HIMSELF HE HAD RETREATED INTO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
AND THERE WITH HAUGHTY EYE AND HEAD BORNE HIGH WITH THIS STUMP OF A
WEAPON IN HIS HAND HE WAS STILL SO ALARMING AS TO SPEEDILY CREATE AN
EMPTY SPACE AROUND HIM
A CRY AROSE
HE IS THE LEADER IT WAS HE WHO SLEW THE ARTILLERY MAN
IT IS WELL THAT
HE HAS PLACED HIMSELF THERE
LET HIM REMAIN THERE
LET US SHOOT HIM DOWN
ON THE SPOT
SHOOT ME SAID ENJOLRAS
AND FLINGING AWAY HIS BIT OF GUN BARREL AND FOLDING HIS ARMS HE
OFFERED HIS BREAST
THE AUDACITY OF A FINE DEATH ALWAYS AFFECTS MEN
AS SOON AS ENJOLRAS
FOLDED HIS ARMS AND ACCEPTED HIS END THE DIN OF STRIFE CEASED IN
THE ROOM AND THIS CHAOS SUDDENLY STILLED INTO A SORT OF SEPULCHRAL
SOLEMNITY
THE MENACING MAJESTY OF ENJOLRAS DISARMED AND MOTIONLESS
APPEARED TO OPPRESS THIS TUMULT AND THIS YOUNG MAN HAUGHTY BLOODY
AND CHARMING WHO ALONE HAD NOT A WOUND WHO WAS AS INDIFFERENT AS AN
INVULNERABLE BEING SEEMED BY THE AUTHORITY OF HIS TRANQUIL GLANCE TO
CONSTRAIN THIS SINISTER RABBLE TO KILL HIM RESPECTFULLY
HIS BEAUTY AT
THAT MOMENT AUGMENTED BY HIS PRIDE WAS RESPLENDENT AND HE WAS FRESH
AND ROSY AFTER THE FEARFUL FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS WHICH HAD JUST ELAPSED
AS THOUGH HE COULD NO MORE BE FATIGUED THAN WOUNDED
IT WAS OF HIM
POSSIBLY THAT A WITNESS SPOKE AFTERWARDS BEFORE THE COUNCIL OF
WAR THERE WAS AN INSURGENT WHOM I HEARD CALLED APOLLO A NATIONAL
GUARDSMAN WHO HAD TAKEN AIM AT ENJOLRAS LOWERED HIS GUN SAYING IT
SEEMS TO ME THAT I AM ABOUT TO SHOOT A FLOWER
TWELVE MEN FORMED INTO A SQUAD IN THE CORNER OPPOSITE ENJOLRAS AND
SILENTLY MADE READY THEIR GUNS
THEN A SERGEANT SHOUTED
TAKE AIM
AN OFFICER INTERVENED
WAIT
AND ADDRESSING ENJOLRAS
DO YOU WISH TO HAVE YOUR EYES BANDAGED
NO
WAS IT YOU WHO KILLED THE ARTILLERY SERGEANT
YES
GRANTAIRE HAD WAKED UP A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE
GRANTAIRE IT WILL BE REMEMBERED HAD BEEN ASLEEP EVER SINCE THE
PRECEDING EVENING IN THE UPPER ROOM OF THE WINE SHOP SEATED ON A CHAIR
AND LEANING ON THE TABLE
HE REALIZED IN ITS FULLEST SENSE THE OLD METAPHOR OF DEAD DRUNK THE
HIDEOUS POTION OF ABSINTHE PORTER AND ALCOHOL HAD THROWN HIM INTO A
LETHARGY
HIS TABLE BEING SMALL AND NOT SUITABLE FOR THE BARRICADE
HE HAD BEEN LEFT IN POSSESSION OF IT
HE WAS STILL IN THE SAME POSTURE
WITH HIS BREAST BENT OVER THE TABLE HIS HEAD LYING FLAT ON HIS ARMS
SURROUNDED BY GLASSES BEER JUGS AND BOTTLES
HIS WAS THE OVERWHELMING
SLUMBER OF THE TORPID BEAR AND THE SATIATED LEECH
NOTHING HAD HAD ANY
EFFECT UPON IT NEITHER THE FUSILLADE NOR THE CANNON BALLS NOR THE
GRAPE SHOT WHICH HAD MADE ITS WAY THROUGH THE WINDOW INTO THE ROOM WHERE
HE WAS
NOR THE TREMENDOUS UPROAR OF THE ASSAULT
HE MERELY REPLIED TO
THE CANNONADE NOW AND THEN BY A SNORE
HE SEEMED TO BE WAITING THERE
FOR A BULLET WHICH SHOULD SPARE HIM THE TROUBLE OF WAKING
MANY CORPSES
WERE STREWN AROUND HIM AND AT THE FIRST GLANCE THERE WAS NOTHING TO
DISTINGUISH HIM FROM THOSE PROFOUND SLEEPERS OF DEATH
NOISE DOES NOT ROUSE A DRUNKEN MAN SILENCE AWAKENS HIM
THE FALL
OF EVERYTHING AROUND HIM ONLY AUGMENTED GRANTAIRE'S PROSTRATION THE
CRUMBLING OF ALL THINGS WAS HIS LULLABY
THE SORT OF HALT WHICH THE
TUMULT UNDERWENT IN THE PRESENCE OF ENJOLRAS WAS A SHOCK TO THIS HEAVY
SLUMBER
IT HAD THE EFFECT OF A CARRIAGE GOING AT FULL SPEED WHICH
SUDDENLY COMES TO A DEAD STOP
THE PERSONS DOZING WITHIN IT WAKE UP
GRANTAIRE ROSE TO HIS FEET WITH A START STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS RUBBED
HIS EYES STARED YAWNED AND UNDERSTOOD
A FIT OF DRUNKENNESS REACHING ITS END RESEMBLES A CURTAIN WHICH IS TORN
AWAY
ONE BEHOLDS AT A SINGLE GLANCE AND AS A WHOLE ALL THAT IT HAS
CONCEALED
ALL SUDDENLY PRESENTS ITSELF TO THE MEMORY AND THE DRUNKARD
WHO HAS KNOWN NOTHING OF WHAT HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE DURING THE LAST
TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAS NO SOONER OPENED HIS EYES THAN HE IS PERFECTLY
INFORMED
IDEAS RECUR TO HIM WITH ABRUPT LUCIDITY THE OBLITERATION
OF INTOXICATION A SORT OF STEAM WHICH HAS OBSCURED THE BRAIN IS
DISSIPATED AND MAKES WAY FOR THE CLEAR AND SHARPLY OUTLINED IMPORTUNITY
OF REALITIES
RELEGATED AS HE WAS TO ONE CORNER AND SHELTERED BEHIND THE
BILLIARD TABLE THE SOLDIERS WHOSE EYES WERE FIXED ON ENJOLRAS HAD NOT
EVEN NOTICED GRANTAIRE AND THE SERGEANT WAS PREPARING TO REPEAT HIS
ORDER TAKE AIM WHEN ALL AT ONCE THEY HEARD A STRONG VOICE SHOUT
BESIDE THEM
LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC I'M ONE OF THEM
GRANTAIRE HAD RISEN
THE IMMENSE GLEAM OF THE WHOLE COMBAT WHICH HE
HAD MISSED AND IN WHICH HE HAD HAD NO PART APPEARED IN THE BRILLIANT
GLANCE OF THE TRANSFIGURED DRUNKEN MAN
HE REPEATED LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC CROSSED THE ROOM WITH A FIRM
STRIDE AND PLACED HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE GUNS BESIDE ENJOLRAS
FINISH BOTH OF US AT ONE BLOW SAID HE
AND TURNING GENTLY TO ENJOLRAS HE SAID TO HIM
DO YOU PERMIT IT
ENJOLRAS PRESSED HIS HAND WITH A SMILE
THIS SMILE WAS NOT ENDED WHEN THE REPORT RESOUNDED
ENJOLRAS PIERCED BY EIGHT BULLETS REMAINED LEANING AGAINST THE WALL
AS THOUGH THE BALLS HAD NAILED HIM THERE
ONLY HIS HEAD WAS BOWED
GRANTAIRE FELL AT HIS FEET AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A THUNDERBOLT
A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE SOLDIERS DISLODGED THE LAST REMAINING
INSURGENTS WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE
THEY FIRED
INTO THE ATTIC THROUGH A WOODEN LATTICE
THEY FOUGHT UNDER THE VERY
ROOF
THEY FLUNG BODIES SOME OF THEM STILL ALIVE OUT THROUGH THE
WINDOWS
TWO LIGHT INFANTRYMEN WHO TRIED TO LIFT THE SHATTERED OMNIBUS
WERE SLAIN BY TWO SHOTS FIRED FROM THE ATTIC
A MAN IN A BLOUSE WAS
FLUNG DOWN FROM IT WITH A BAYONET WOUND IN THE ABDOMEN AND BREATHED
HIS LAST ON THE GROUND
A SOLDIER AND AN INSURGENT SLIPPED TOGETHER
ON THE SLOPING SLATES OF THE ROOF AND AS THEY WOULD NOT RELEASE EACH
OTHER THEY FELL CLASPED IN A FEROCIOUS EMBRACE
A SIMILAR CONFLICT
WENT ON IN THE CELLAR
SHOUTS SHOTS A FIERCE TRAMPLING
THEN SILENCE
THE BARRICADE WAS CAPTURED
THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO SEARCH THE HOUSES ROUND ABOUT AND TO PURSUE THE
FUGITIVES
CHAPTER XXIV PRISONER
MARIUS WAS IN FACT A PRISONER
THE HAND WHICH HAD SEIZED HIM FROM BEHIND AND WHOSE GRASP HE HAD FELT
AT THE MOMENT OF HIS FALL AND HIS LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS WAS THAT OF JEAN
VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN HAD TAKEN NO OTHER PART IN THE COMBAT THAN TO EXPOSE
HIMSELF IN IT
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIM NO ONE IN THAT SUPREME PHASE
OF AGONY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THE WOUNDED
THANKS TO HIM EVERYWHERE
PRESENT IN THE CARNAGE LIKE A PROVIDENCE THOSE WHO FELL WERE PICKED
UP TRANSPORTED TO THE TAP ROOM AND CARED FOR
IN THE INTERVALS HE
REAPPEARED ON THE BARRICADE
BUT NOTHING WHICH COULD RESEMBLE A BLOW
AN ATTACK OR EVEN PERSONAL DEFENCE PROCEEDED FROM HIS HANDS
HE HELD HIS
PEACE AND LENT SUCCOR
MOREOVER HE HAD RECEIVED ONLY A FEW SCRATCHES
THE BULLETS WOULD HAVE NONE OF HIM
IF SUICIDE FORMED PART OF WHAT HE
HAD MEDITATED ON COMING TO THIS SEPULCHRE TO THAT SPOT HE HAD
NOT SUCCEEDED
BUT WE DOUBT WHETHER HE HAD THOUGHT OF SUICIDE AN
IRRELIGIOUS ACT
JEAN VALJEAN IN THE THICK CLOUD OF THE COMBAT DID NOT APPEAR TO SEE
MARIUS THE TRUTH IS THAT HE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES FROM THE LATTER
WHEN
A SHOT LAID MARIUS LOW JEAN VALJEAN LEAPED FORWARD WITH THE AGILITY OF
A TIGER FELL UPON HIM AS ON HIS PREY AND BORE HIM OFF
THE WHIRLWIND OF THE ATTACK WAS AT THAT MOMENT SO VIOLENTLY
CONCENTRATED UPON ENJOLRAS AND UPON THE DOOR OF THE WINE SHOP THAT
NO ONE SAW JEAN VALJEAN SUSTAINING THE FAINTING MARIUS IN HIS ARMS
TRAVERSE THE UNPAVED FIELD OF THE BARRICADE AND DISAPPEAR BEHIND THE
ANGLE OF THE CORINTHE BUILDING
THE READER WILL RECALL THIS ANGLE WHICH FORMED A SORT OF CAPE ON THE
STREET IT AFFORDED SHELTER FROM THE BULLETS THE GRAPE SHOT AND ALL
EYES AND A FEW SQUARE FEET OF SPACE
THERE IS SOMETIMES A CHAMBER
WHICH DOES NOT BURN IN THE MIDST OF A CONFLAGRATION AND IN THE MIDST OF
RAGING SEAS BEYOND A PROMONTORY OR AT THE EXTREMITY OF A BLIND ALLEY
OF SHOALS A TRANQUIL NOOK
IT WAS IN THIS SORT OF FOLD IN THE INTERIOR
TRAPEZIUM OF THE BARRICADE THAT EPONINE HAD BREATHED HER LAST
THERE JEAN VALJEAN HALTED LET MARIUS SLIDE TO THE GROUND PLACED HIS
BACK AGAINST THE WALL AND CAST HIS EYES ABOUT HIM
THE SITUATION WAS ALARMING
FOR AN INSTANT FOR TWO OR THREE PERHAPS THIS BIT OF WALL WAS A
SHELTER BUT HOW WAS HE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS MASSACRE HE RECALLED THE
ANGUISH WHICH HE HAD SUFFERED IN THE RUE POLONCEAU EIGHT YEARS BEFORE
AND IN WHAT MANNER HE HAD CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE IT WAS DIFFICULT
THEN TO DAY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
HE HAD BEFORE HIM THAT DEAF AND
IMPLACABLE HOUSE SIX STORIES IN HEIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO BE INHABITED
ONLY BY A DEAD MAN LEANING OUT OF HIS WINDOW HE HAD ON HIS RIGHT THE
RATHER LOW BARRICADE WHICH SHUT OFF THE RUE DE LA PETITE TRUANDERIE
TO PASS THIS OBSTACLE SEEMED EASY BUT BEYOND THE CREST OF THE BARRIER A
LINE OF BAYONETS WAS VISIBLE
THE TROOPS OF THE LINE WERE POSTED ON THE
WATCH BEHIND THAT BARRICADE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT TO PASS THE BARRICADE
WAS TO GO IN QUEST OF THE FIRE OF THE PLATOON AND THAT ANY HEAD WHICH
SHOULD RUN THE RISK OF LIFTING ITSELF ABOVE THE TOP OF THAT WALL OF
STONES WOULD SERVE AS A TARGET FOR SIXTY SHOTS
ON HIS LEFT HE HAD THE
FIELD OF BATTLE
DEATH LURKED ROUND THE CORNER OF THAT WALL
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
ONLY A BIRD COULD HAVE EXTRICATED ITSELF FROM THIS PREDICAMENT
AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO DECIDE ON THE INSTANT TO DEVISE SOME EXPEDIENT
TO COME TO SOME DECISION
FIGHTING WAS GOING ON A FEW PACES AWAY
FORTUNATELY ALL WERE RAGING AROUND A SINGLE POINT THE DOOR OF THE
WINE SHOP BUT IF IT SHOULD OCCUR TO ONE SOLDIER TO ONE SINGLE SOLDIER
TO TURN THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE OR TO ATTACK HIM ON THE FLANK ALL WAS
OVER
JEAN VALJEAN GAZED AT THE HOUSE FACING HIM HE GAZED AT THE BARRICADE AT
ONE SIDE OF HIM THEN HE LOOKED AT THE GROUND WITH THE VIOLENCE OF THE
LAST EXTREMITY BEWILDERED AND AS THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO PIERCE
A HOLE THERE WITH HIS EYES
BY DINT OF STARING SOMETHING VAGUELY STRIKING IN SUCH AN AGONY BEGAN
TO ASSUME FORM AND OUTLINE AT HIS FEET AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A POWER
OF GLANCE WHICH MADE THE THING DESIRED UNFOLD
A FEW PACES DISTANT HE
PERCEIVED AT THE BASE OF THE SMALL BARRIER SO PITILESSLY GUARDED AND
WATCHED ON THE EXTERIOR BENEATH A DISORDERED MASS OF PAVING STONES
WHICH PARTLY CONCEALED IT AN IRON GRATING PLACED FLAT AND ON A LEVEL
WITH THE SOIL
THIS GRATING MADE OF STOUT TRANSVERSE BARS WAS ABOUT
TWO FEET SQUARE
THE FRAME OF PAVING STONES WHICH SUPPORTED IT HAD BEEN
TORN UP AND IT WAS AS IT WERE UNFASTENED
THROUGH THE BARS A VIEW COULD BE HAD OF A DARK APERTURE SOMETHING LIKE
THE FLUE OF A CHIMNEY OR THE PIPE OF A CISTERN
JEAN VALJEAN DARTED
FORWARD
HIS OLD ART OF ESCAPE ROSE TO HIS BRAIN LIKE AN ILLUMINATION
TO THRUST ASIDE THE STONES TO RAISE THE GRATING TO LIFT MARIUS WHO
WAS AS INERT AS A DEAD BODY UPON HIS SHOULDERS TO DESCEND WITH THIS
BURDEN ON HIS LOINS AND WITH THE AID OF HIS ELBOWS AND KNEES INTO THAT
SORT OF WELL FORTUNATELY NOT VERY DEEP TO LET THE HEAVY TRAP UPON
WHICH THE LOOSENED STONES ROLLED DOWN AFRESH FALL INTO ITS PLACE BEHIND
HIM TO GAIN HIS FOOTING ON A FLAGGED SURFACE THREE METRES BELOW THE
SURFACE ALL THIS WAS EXECUTED LIKE THAT WHICH ONE DOES IN DREAMS WITH
THE STRENGTH OF A GIANT AND THE RAPIDITY OF AN EAGLE THIS TOOK ONLY A
FEW MINUTES
JEAN VALJEAN FOUND HIMSELF WITH MARIUS WHO WAS STILL UNCONSCIOUS IN A
SORT OF LONG SUBTERRANEAN CORRIDOR
THERE REIGNED PROFOUND PEACE ABSOLUTE SILENCE NIGHT
THE IMPRESSION WHICH HE HAD FORMERLY EXPERIENCED WHEN FALLING FROM THE
WALL INTO THE CONVENT RECURRED TO HIM
ONLY WHAT HE WAS CARRYING TO DAY
WAS NOT COSETTE IT WAS MARIUS
HE COULD BARELY HEAR THE FORMIDABLE
TUMULT IN THE WINE SHOP TAKEN BY ASSAULT LIKE A VAGUE MURMUR OVERHEAD
BOOK SECOND THE INTESTINE OF THE LEVIATHAN
CHAPTER I THE LAND IMPOVERISHED BY THE SEA
PARIS CASTS TWENTY FIVE MILLIONS YEARLY INTO THE WATER
AND THIS WITHOUT
METAPHOR
HOW AND IN WHAT MANNER DAY AND NIGHT
WITH WHAT OBJECT WITH
NO OBJECT
WITH WHAT INTENTION WITH NO INTENTION
WHY FOR NO
REASON
BY MEANS OF WHAT ORGAN BY MEANS OF ITS INTESTINE
WHAT IS ITS
INTESTINE THE SEWER
TWENTY FIVE MILLIONS IS THE MOST MODERATE APPROXIMATIVE FIGURE WHICH THE
VALUATIONS OF SPECIAL SCIENCE HAVE SET UPON IT
SCIENCE AFTER HAVING LONG GROPED ABOUT NOW KNOWS THAT THE MOST
FECUNDATING AND THE MOST EFFICACIOUS OF FERTILIZERS IS HUMAN MANURE
THE CHINESE LET US CONFESS IT TO OUR SHAME KNEW IT BEFORE US
NOT
A CHINESE PEASANT IT IS ECKBERG WHO SAYS THIS GOES TO TOWN WITHOUT
BRINGING BACK WITH HIM AT THE TWO EXTREMITIES OF HIS BAMBOO POLE TWO
FULL BUCKETS OF WHAT WE DESIGNATE AS FILTH
THANKS TO HUMAN DUNG THE
EARTH IN CHINA IS STILL AS YOUNG AS IN THE DAYS OF ABRAHAM
CHINESE
WHEAT YIELDS A HUNDRED FOLD OF THE SEED
THERE IS NO GUANO COMPARABLE
IN FERTILITY WITH THE DETRITUS OF A CAPITAL
A GREAT CITY IS THE MOST
MIGHTY OF DUNG MAKERS
CERTAIN SUCCESS WOULD ATTEND THE EXPERIMENT
OF EMPLOYING THE CITY TO MANURE THE PLAIN
IF OUR GOLD IS MANURE OUR
MANURE ON THE OTHER HAND IS GOLD
WHAT IS DONE WITH THIS GOLDEN MANURE IT IS SWEPT INTO THE ABYSS
FLEETS OF VESSELS ARE DESPATCHED AT GREAT EXPENSE TO COLLECT THE DUNG
OF PETRELS AND PENGUINS AT THE SOUTH POLE AND THE INCALCULABLE ELEMENT
OF OPULENCE WHICH WE HAVE ON HAND WE SEND TO THE SEA
ALL THE HUMAN AND
ANIMAL MANURE WHICH THE WORLD WASTES RESTORED TO THE LAND INSTEAD OF
BEING CAST INTO THE WATER WOULD SUFFICE TO NOURISH THE WORLD
THOSE HEAPS OF FILTH AT THE GATE POSTS THOSE TUMBRILS OF MUD WHICH
JOLT THROUGH THE STREET BY NIGHT THOSE TERRIBLE CASKS OF THE STREET
DEPARTMENT THOSE FETID DRIPPINGS OF SUBTERRANEAN MIRE WHICH THE
PAVEMENTS HIDE FROM YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE THEY ARE THE MEADOW
IN FLOWER THE GREEN GRASS WILD THYME THYME AND SAGE THEY ARE GAME
THEY ARE CATTLE THEY ARE THE SATISFIED BELLOWS OF GREAT OXEN IN THE
EVENING THEY ARE PERFUMED HAY THEY ARE GOLDEN WHEAT THEY ARE THE
BREAD ON YOUR TABLE THEY ARE THE WARM BLOOD IN YOUR VEINS THEY ARE
HEALTH THEY ARE JOY THEY ARE LIFE
THIS IS THE WILL OF THAT MYSTERIOUS
CREATION WHICH IS TRANSFORMATION ON EARTH AND TRANSFIGURATION IN HEAVEN
RESTORE THIS TO THE GREAT CRUCIBLE YOUR ABUNDANCE WILL FLOW FORTH FROM
IT
THE NUTRITION OF THE PLAINS FURNISHES THE NOURISHMENT OF MEN
YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO LOSE THIS WEALTH AND TO CONSIDER ME
RIDICULOUS TO BOOT
THIS WILL FORM THE MASTER PIECE OF YOUR IGNORANCE
STATISTICIANS HAVE CALCULATED THAT FRANCE ALONE MAKES A DEPOSIT OF
HALF A MILLIARD EVERY YEAR IN THE ATLANTIC THROUGH THE MOUTHS OF HER
RIVERS
NOTE THIS WITH FIVE HUNDRED MILLIONS WE COULD PAY ONE QUARTER
OF THE EXPENSES OF OUR BUDGET
THE CLEVERNESS OF MAN IS SUCH THAT HE
PREFERS TO GET RID OF THESE FIVE HUNDRED MILLIONS IN THE GUTTER
IT IS
THE VERY SUBSTANCE OF THE PEOPLE THAT IS CARRIED OFF HERE DROP BY
DROP THERE WAVE AFTER WAVE THE WRETCHED OUTPOUR OF OUR SEWERS INTO THE
RIVERS AND THE GIGANTIC COLLECTION OF OUR RIVERS INTO THE OCEAN
EVERY
HICCOUGH OF OUR SEWERS COSTS US A THOUSAND FRANCS
FROM THIS SPRING TWO
RESULTS THE LAND IMPOVERISHED AND THE WATER TAINTED
HUNGER ARISING
FROM THE FURROW AND DISEASE FROM THE STREAM
IT IS NOTORIOUS FOR EXAMPLE THAT AT THE PRESENT HOUR THE THAMES IS
POISONING LONDON
SO FAR AS PARIS IS CONCERNED IT HAS BECOME INDISPENSABLE OF LATE TO
TRANSPORT THE MOUTHS OF THE SEWERS DOWN STREAM BELOW THE LAST BRIDGE
A DOUBLE TUBULAR APPARATUS PROVIDED WITH VALVES AND SLUICES SUCKING UP
AND DRIVING BACK A SYSTEM OF ELEMENTARY DRAINAGE SIMPLE AS THE LUNGS
OF A MAN AND WHICH IS ALREADY IN FULL WORKING ORDER IN MANY COMMUNITIES
IN ENGLAND WOULD SUFFICE TO CONDUCT THE PURE WATER OF THE FIELDS INTO
OUR CITIES AND TO SEND BACK TO THE FIELDS THE RICH WATER OF THE CITIES
AND THIS EASY EXCHANGE THE SIMPLEST IN THE WORLD WOULD RETAIN AMONG US
THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLIONS NOW THROWN AWAY
PEOPLE ARE THINKING OF OTHER
THINGS
THE PROCESS ACTUALLY IN USE DOES EVIL WITH THE INTENTION OF DOING GOOD
THE INTENTION IS GOOD THE RESULT IS MELANCHOLY
THINKING TO PURGE THE
CITY THE POPULATION IS BLANCHED LIKE PLANTS RAISED IN CELLARS
A SEWER
IS A MISTAKE
WHEN DRAINAGE EVERYWHERE WITH ITS DOUBLE FUNCTION
RESTORING WHAT IT TAKES SHALL HAVE REPLACED THE SEWER WHICH IS A
SIMPLE IMPOVERISHING WASHING THEN THIS BEING COMBINED WITH THE DATA
OF A NOW SOCIAL ECONOMY THE PRODUCT OF THE EARTH WILL BE INCREASED
TENFOLD AND THE PROBLEM OF MISERY WILL BE SINGULARLY LIGHTENED
ADD THE
SUPPRESSION OF PARASITISM AND IT WILL BE SOLVED
IN THE MEANWHILE THE PUBLIC WEALTH FLOWS AWAY TO THE RIVER AND LEAKAGE
TAKES PLACE
LEAKAGE IS THE WORD
EUROPE IS BEING RUINED IN THIS MANNER
BY EXHAUSTION
AS FOR FRANCE WE HAVE JUST CITED ITS FIGURES
NOW PARIS CONTAINS ONE
TWENTY FIFTH OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF FRANCE AND PARISIAN GUANO BEING
THE RICHEST OF ALL WE UNDERSTATE THE TRUTH WHEN WE VALUE THE LOSS ON
THE PART OF PARIS AT TWENTY FIVE MILLIONS IN THE HALF MILLIARD WHICH
FRANCE ANNUALLY REJECTS
THESE TWENTY FIVE MILLIONS EMPLOYED IN
ASSISTANCE AND ENJOYMENT WOULD DOUBLE THE SPLENDOR OF PARIS
THE
CITY SPENDS THEM IN SEWERS
SO THAT WE MAY SAY THAT PARIS'S GREAT
PRODIGALITY ITS WONDERFUL FESTIVAL ITS BEAUJON FOLLY ITS ORGY ITS
STREAM OF GOLD FROM FULL HANDS ITS POMP ITS LUXURY ITS MAGNIFICENCE
IS ITS SEWER SYSTEM
IT IS IN THIS MANNER THAT IN THE BLINDNESS OF A POOR POLITICAL ECONOMY
WE DROWN AND ALLOW TO FLOAT DOWN STREAM AND TO BE LOST IN THE GULFS THE
WELL BEING OF ALL
THERE SHOULD BE NETS AT SAINT CLOUD FOR THE PUBLIC
FORTUNE
ECONOMICALLY CONSIDERED THE MATTER CAN BE SUMMED UP THUS PARIS IS
A SPENDTHRIFT
PARIS THAT MODEL CITY THAT PATRON OF WELL ARRANGED
CAPITALS OF WHICH EVERY NATION STRIVES TO POSSESS A COPY THAT
METROPOLIS OF THE IDEAL THAT AUGUST COUNTRY OF THE INITIATIVE OF
IMPULSE AND OF EFFORT THAT CENTRE AND THAT DWELLING OF MINDS THAT
NATION CITY THAT HIVE OF THE FUTURE THAT MARVELLOUS COMBINATION OF
BABYLON AND CORINTH WOULD MAKE A PEASANT OF THE FO KIAN SHRUG HIS
SHOULDERS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW WHICH WE HAVE JUST INDICATED
IMITATE PARIS AND YOU WILL RUIN YOURSELVES
MOREOVER AND PARTICULARLY IN THIS IMMEMORIAL AND SENSELESS WASTE PARIS
IS ITSELF AN IMITATOR
THESE SURPRISING EXHIBITIONS OF STUPIDITY ARE NOT NOVEL THIS IS NO
YOUNG FOLLY
THE ANCIENTS DID LIKE THE MODERNS
THE SEWERS OF ROME
SAYS LIEBIG HAVE ABSORBED ALL THE WELL BEING OF THE ROMAN PEASANT
WHEN THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME WAS RUINED BY THE ROMAN SEWER ROME EXHAUSTED
ITALY AND WHEN SHE HAD PUT ITALY IN HER SEWER SHE POURED IN SICILY
THEN SARDINIA THEN AFRICA
THE SEWER OF ROME HAS ENGULFED THE WORLD
THIS CESS POOL OFFERED ITS ENGULFMENT TO THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSE
URBI
ET ORBI
ETERNAL CITY UNFATHOMABLE SEWER
ROME SETS THE EXAMPLE FOR THESE THINGS AS WELL AS FOR OTHERS
PARIS FOLLOWS THIS EXAMPLE WITH ALL THE STUPIDITY PECULIAR TO
INTELLIGENT TOWNS
FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE OPERATION UPON THE SUBJECT OF WHICH WE HAVE
JUST EXPLAINED OUR VIEWS PARIS HAS BENEATH IT ANOTHER PARIS A PARIS
OF SEWERS WHICH HAS ITS STREETS ITS CROSS ROADS ITS SQUARES ITS
BLIND ALLEYS ITS ARTERIES AND ITS CIRCULATION WHICH IS OF MIRE AND
MINUS THE HUMAN FORM
FOR NOTHING MUST BE FLATTERED NOT EVEN A GREAT PEOPLE WHERE THERE
IS EVERYTHING THERE IS ALSO IGNOMINY BY THE SIDE OF SUBLIMITY AND
IF PARIS CONTAINS ATHENS THE CITY OF LIGHT TYRE THE CITY OF MIGHT
SPARTA THE CITY OF VIRTUE NINEVEH THE CITY OF MARVELS IT ALSO
CONTAINS LUTETIA THE CITY OF MUD
HOWEVER THE STAMP OF ITS POWER IS THERE ALSO AND THE TITANIC SINK OF
PARIS REALIZES AMONG MONUMENTS THAT STRANGE IDEAL REALIZED IN HUMANITY
BY SOME MEN LIKE MACCHIAVELLI BACON AND MIRABEAU GRANDIOSE VILENESS
THE SUB SOIL OF PARIS IF THE EYE COULD PENETRATE ITS SURFACE WOULD
PRESENT THE ASPECT OF A COLOSSAL MADREPORE
A SPONGE HAS NO MORE
PARTITIONS AND DUCTS THAN THE MOUND OF EARTH FOR A CIRCUIT OF SIX
LEAGUES ROUND ABOUT ON WHICH RESTS THE GREAT AND ANCIENT CITY
NOT TO
MENTION ITS CATACOMBS WHICH ARE A SEPARATE CELLAR NOT TO MENTION
THE INEXTRICABLE TRELLIS WORK OF GAS PIPES WITHOUT RECKONING THE VAST
TUBULAR SYSTEM FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF FRESH WATER WHICH ENDS IN THE
PILLAR FOUNTAINS THE SEWERS ALONE FORM A TREMENDOUS SHADOWY NET WORK
UNDER THE TWO BANKS A LABYRINTH WHICH HAS ITS SLOPE FOR ITS GUIDING
THREAD
THERE APPEARS IN THE HUMID MIST THE RAT WHICH SEEMS THE PRODUCT TO
WHICH PARIS HAS GIVEN BIRTH
CHAPTER II ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE SEWER
LET THE READER IMAGINE PARIS LIFTED OFF LIKE A COVER THE SUBTERRANEAN
NET WORK OF SEWERS FROM A BIRD'S EYE VIEW WILL OUTLINE ON THE BANKS
A SPECIES OF LARGE BRANCH GRAFTED ON THE RIVER
ON THE RIGHT BANK THE
BELT SEWER WILL FORM THE TRUNK OF THIS BRANCH THE SECONDARY DUCTS WILL
FORM THE BRANCHES AND THOSE WITHOUT EXIT THE TWIGS
THIS FIGURE IS BUT A SUMMARY ONE AND HALF EXACT THE RIGHT ANGLE WHICH
IS THE CUSTOMARY ANGLE OF THIS SPECIES OF SUBTERRANEAN RAMIFICATIONS
BEING VERY RARE IN VEGETATION
A MORE ACCURATE IMAGE OF THIS STRANGE GEOMETRICAL PLAN CAN BE FORMED
BY SUPPOSING THAT ONE IS VIEWING SOME ECCENTRIC ORIENTAL ALPHABET
AS INTRICATE AS A THICKET AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF SHADOWS AND THE
MISSHAPEN LETTERS SHOULD BE WELDED ONE TO ANOTHER IN APPARENT CONFUSION
AND AS AT HAPHAZARD NOW BY THEIR ANGLES AGAIN BY THEIR EXTREMITIES
SINKS AND SEWERS PLAYED A GREAT PART IN THE MIDDLE AGES IN THE LOWER
EMPIRE AND IN THE ORIENT OF OLD
THE MASSES REGARDED THESE BEDS OF
DECOMPOSITION THESE MONSTROUS CRADLES OF DEATH WITH A FEAR THAT WAS
ALMOST RELIGIOUS
THE VERMIN DITCH OF BENARES IS NO LESS CONDUCIVE TO
GIDDINESS THAN THE LIONS' DITCH OF BABYLON
TEGLATH PHALASAR ACCORDING
TO THE RABBINICAL BOOKS SWORE BY THE SINK OF NINEVEH
IT WAS FROM THE
SEWER OF MUNSTER THAT JOHN OF LEYDEN PRODUCED HIS FALSE MOON AND IT
WAS FROM THE CESS POOL OF KEKSCHEB THAT ORIENTAL MENALCHME MOKANNA THE
VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN CAUSED HIS FALSE SUN TO EMERGE
THE HISTORY OF MEN IS REFLECTED IN THE HISTORY OF SEWERS
THE
GERMONIAE 58 NARRATED ROME
THE SEWER OF PARIS HAS BEEN AN ANCIENT AND
FORMIDABLE THING
IT HAS BEEN A SEPULCHRE IT HAS SERVED AS AN ASYLUM
CRIME INTELLIGENCE SOCIAL PROTEST LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE THOUGHT
THEFT ALL THAT HUMAN LAWS PERSECUTE OR HAVE PERSECUTED IS HIDDEN IN
THAT HOLE THE MAILLOTINS IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY THE TIRE LAINE OF
THE FIFTEENTH THE HUGUENOTS IN THE SIXTEENTH MORIN'S ILLUMINATED IN
THE SEVENTEENTH THE CHAUFFEURS BRIGANDS IN THE EIGHTEENTH
A
HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE NOCTURNAL BLOW OF THE DAGGER EMERGED THENCE THE
PICKPOCKET IN DANGER SLIPPED THITHER THE FOREST HAD ITS CAVE PARIS HAD
ITS SEWER
VAGRANCY THAT GALLIC PICARERIA ACCEPTED THE SEWER AS THE
ADJUNCT OF THE COUR DES MIRACLES AND AT EVENING IT RETURNED THITHER
FIERCE AND SLY THROUGH THE MAUBUEE OUTLET AS INTO A BED CHAMBER
IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT THOSE WHO HAD THE BLIND ALLEY VIDE GOUSSET
EMPTY POCKET OR THE RUE COUPE GORGE CUT THROAT FOR THE SCENE OF
THEIR DAILY LABOR SHOULD HAVE FOR THEIR DOMICILE BY NIGHT THE CULVERT
OF THE CHEMIN VERT OR THE CATCH BASIN OF HUREPOIX
HENCE A THRONG OF
SOUVENIRS
ALL SORTS OF PHANTOMS HAUNT THESE LONG SOLITARY
CORRIDORS EVERYWHERE IS PUTRESCENCE AND MIASMA HERE AND THERE ARE
BREATHING HOLES WHERE VILLON WITHIN CONVERSES WITH RABELAIS WITHOUT
THE SEWER IN ANCIENT PARIS IS THE RENDEZVOUS OF ALL EXHAUSTIONS AND
OF ALL ATTEMPTS
POLITICAL ECONOMY THEREIN SPIES A DETRITUS SOCIAL
PHILOSOPHY THERE BEHOLDS A RESIDUUM
THE SEWER IS THE CONSCIENCE OF THE CITY
EVERYTHING THERE CONVERGES
AND CONFRONTS EVERYTHING ELSE
IN THAT LIVID SPOT THERE ARE SHADES BUT
THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY SECRETS
EACH THING BEARS ITS TRUE FORM OR AT
LEAST ITS DEFINITIVE FORM
THE MASS OF FILTH HAS THIS IN ITS FAVOR
THAT IT IS NOT A LIAR
INGENUOUSNESS HAS TAKEN REFUGE THERE
THE MASK
OF BASIL IS TO BE FOUND THERE BUT ONE BEHOLDS ITS CARDBOARD AND ITS
STRINGS AND THE INSIDE AS WELL AS THE OUTSIDE AND IT IS ACCENTUATED
BY HONEST MUD
SCAPIN'S FALSE NOSE IS ITS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR
ALL THE
UNCLEANNESSES OF CIVILIZATION ONCE PAST THEIR USE FALL INTO THIS
TRENCH OF TRUTH WHERE THE IMMENSE SOCIAL SLIDING ENDS
THEY ARE
THERE ENGULFED BUT THEY DISPLAY THEMSELVES THERE
THIS MIXTURE IS A
CONFESSION
THERE NO MORE FALSE APPEARANCES NO PLASTERING OVER IS
POSSIBLE FILTH REMOVES ITS SHIRT ABSOLUTE DENUDATION PUTS TO THE ROUT
ALL ILLUSIONS AND MIRAGES THERE IS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT WHAT REALLY
EXISTS PRESENTING THE SINISTER FORM OF THAT WHICH IS COMING TO AN END
THERE THE BOTTOM OF A BOTTLE INDICATES DRUNKENNESS A BASKET HANDLE
TELLS A TALE OF DOMESTICITY THERE THE CORE OF AN APPLE WHICH HAS
ENTERTAINED LITERARY OPINIONS BECOMES AN APPLE CORE ONCE MORE THE
EFFIGY ON THE BIG SOU BECOMES FRANKLY COVERED WITH VERDIGRIS CAIPHAS'
SPITTLE MEETS FALSTAFF'S PUKING THE LOUIS D'OR WHICH COMES FROM
THE GAMING HOUSE JOSTLES THE NAIL WHENCE HANGS THE ROPE'S END OF THE
SUICIDE
A LIVID FOETUS ROLLS ALONG ENVELOPED IN THE SPANGLES WHICH
DANCED AT THE OPERA LAST SHROVE TUESDAY A CAP WHICH HAS PRONOUNCED
JUDGMENT ON MEN WALLOWS BESIDE A MASS OF ROTTENNESS WHICH WAS FORMERLY
MARGOTON'S PETTICOAT IT IS MORE THAN FRATERNIZATION IT IS EQUIVALENT
TO ADDRESSING EACH OTHER AS THOU
ALL WHICH WAS FORMERLY ROUGED IS
WASHED FREE
THE LAST VEIL IS TORN AWAY
A SEWER IS A CYNIC
IT TELLS
EVERYTHING
THE SINCERITY OF FOULNESS PLEASES US AND RESTS THE SOUL
WHEN ONE HAS
PASSED ONE'S TIME IN ENDURING UPON EARTH THE SPECTACLE OF THE GREAT AIRS
WHICH REASONS OF STATE THE OATH POLITICAL SAGACITY HUMAN JUSTICE
PROFESSIONAL PROBITY THE AUSTERITIES OF SITUATION INCORRUPTIBLE ROBES
ALL ASSUME IT SOLACES ONE TO ENTER A SEWER AND TO BEHOLD THE MIRE WHICH
BEFITS IT
THIS IS INSTRUCTIVE AT THE SAME TIME
WE HAVE JUST SAID THAT HISTORY
PASSES THROUGH THE SEWER
THE SAINT BARTHELEMYS FILTER THROUGH THERE
DROP BY DROP BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES
GREAT PUBLIC ASSASSINATIONS
POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS BUTCHERIES TRAVERSE THIS UNDERGROUND PASSAGE
OF CIVILIZATION AND THRUST THEIR CORPSES THERE
FOR THE EYE OF THE
THINKER ALL HISTORIC MURDERERS ARE TO BE FOUND THERE IN THAT HIDEOUS
PENUMBRA ON THEIR KNEES WITH A SCRAP OF THEIR WINDING SHEET FOR
AN APRON DISMALLY SPONGING OUT THEIR WORK
LOUIS XI
IS THERE WITH
TRISTAN FRANCOIS I
WITH DUPRAT CHARLES IX
IS THERE WITH HIS MOTHER
RICHELIEU IS THERE WITH LOUIS XIII LOUVOIS IS THERE LETELLIER IS
THERE HEBERT AND MAILLARD ARE THERE SCRATCHING THE STONES AND TRYING
TO MAKE THE TRACES OF THEIR ACTIONS DISAPPEAR
BENEATH THESE VAULTS ONE
HEARS THE BROOMS OF SPECTRES
ONE THERE BREATHES THE ENORMOUS FETIDNESS
OF SOCIAL CATASTROPHES
ONE BEHOLDS REDDISH REFLECTIONS IN THE CORNERS
THERE FLOWS A TERRIBLE STREAM IN WHICH BLOODY HANDS HAVE BEEN WASHED
THE SOCIAL OBSERVER SHOULD ENTER THESE SHADOWS
THEY FORM A PART OF
HIS LABORATORY
PHILOSOPHY IS THE MICROSCOPE OF THE THOUGHT
EVERYTHING
DESIRES TO FLEE FROM IT BUT NOTHING ESCAPES IT
TERGIVERSATION IS
USELESS
WHAT SIDE OF ONESELF DOES ONE DISPLAY IN EVASIONS THE SHAMEFUL
SIDE
PHILOSOPHY PURSUES WITH ITS GLANCE PROBES THE EVIL AND DOES
NOT PERMIT IT TO ESCAPE INTO NOTHINGNESS
IN THE OBLITERATION OF THINGS
WHICH DISAPPEAR IN THE WATCHING OF THINGS WHICH VANISH IT RECOGNIZES
ALL
IT RECONSTRUCTS THE PURPLE FROM THE RAG AND THE WOMAN FROM THE
SCRAP OF HER DRESS
FROM THE CESS POOL IT RE CONSTITUTES THE CITY FROM
MUD IT RECONSTRUCTS MANNERS FROM THE POTSHERD IT INFERS THE AMPHORA
OR THE JUG
BY THE IMPRINT OF A FINGER NAIL ON A PIECE OF PARCHMENT IT
RECOGNIZES THE DIFFERENCE WHICH SEPARATES THE JEWRY OF THE JUDENGASSE
FROM THE JEWRY OF THE GHETTO
IT RE DISCOVERS IN WHAT REMAINS THAT
WHICH HAS BEEN GOOD EVIL THE TRUE THE BLOOD STAIN OF THE PALACE
THE INK BLOT OF THE CAVERN THE DROP OF SWEAT FROM THE BROTHEL TRIALS
UNDERGONE TEMPTATIONS WELCOMED ORGIES CAST FORTH THE TURN WHICH
CHARACTERS HAVE TAKEN AS THEY BECAME ABASED THE TRACE OF PROSTITUTION
IN SOULS OF WHICH THEIR GROSSNESS RENDERED THEM CAPABLE AND ON THE
VESTURE OF THE PORTERS OF ROME THE MARK OF MESSALINA'S ELBOWING
CHAPTER III BRUNESEAU
THE SEWER OF PARIS IN THE MIDDLE AGES WAS LEGENDARY
IN THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY HENRI II
ATTEMPTED A BORE WHICH FAILED
NOT A HUNDRED YEARS
AGO THE CESS POOL MERCIER ATTESTS THE FACT WAS ABANDONED TO ITSELF
AND FARED AS BEST IT MIGHT
SUCH WAS THIS ANCIENT PARIS DELIVERED OVER TO QUARRELS TO INDECISION
AND TO GROPINGS
IT WAS TOLERABLY STUPID FOR A LONG TIME
LATER ON '89
SHOWED HOW UNDERSTANDING COMES TO CITIES
BUT IN THE GOOD OLD TIMES
THE CAPITAL HAD NOT MUCH HEAD
IT DID NOT KNOW HOW TO MANAGE ITS OWN
AFFAIRS EITHER MORALLY OR MATERIALLY AND COULD NOT SWEEP OUT FILTH
ANY BETTER THAN IT COULD ABUSES
EVERYTHING PRESENTED AN OBSTACLE
EVERYTHING RAISED A QUESTION
THE SEWER FOR EXAMPLE WAS REFRACTORY TO
EVERY ITINERARY
ONE COULD NO MORE FIND ONE'S BEARINGS IN THE SEWER
THAN ONE COULD UNDERSTAND ONE'S POSITION IN THE CITY ABOVE THE
UNINTELLIGIBLE BELOW THE INEXTRICABLE BENEATH THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
THERE REIGNED THE CONFUSION OF CAVERNS DAEDALUS BACKED UP BABEL
SOMETIMES THE PARIS SEWER TOOK A NOTION TO OVERFLOW AS THOUGH THIS
MISUNDERSTOOD NILE WERE SUDDENLY SEIZED WITH A FIT OF RAGE
THERE
OCCURRED INFAMOUS TO RELATE INUNDATIONS OF THE SEWER
AT TIMES THAT
STOMACH OF CIVILIZATION DIGESTED BADLY THE CESS POOL FLOWED BACK INTO
THE THROAT OF THE CITY AND PARIS GOT AN AFTER TASTE OF HER OWN FILTH
THESE RESEMBLANCES OF THE SEWER TO REMORSE HAD THEIR GOOD POINTS THEY
WERE WARNINGS VERY BADLY ACCEPTED HOWEVER THE CITY WAXED INDIGNANT
AT THE AUDACITY OF ITS MIRE AND DID NOT ADMIT THAT THE FILTH SHOULD
RETURN
DRIVE IT OUT BETTER
THE INUNDATION OF 1802 IS ONE OF THE ACTUAL MEMORIES OF PARISIANS OF
THE AGE OF EIGHTY
THE MUD SPREAD IN CROSS FORM OVER THE PLACE DES
VICTOIRES WHERE STANDS THE STATUE OF LOUIS XIV IT ENTERED THE RUE
SAINT HONORE BY THE TWO MOUTHS TO THE SEWER IN THE CHAMPS ELYSEES
THE RUE SAINT FLORENTIN THROUGH THE SAINT FLORENTIN SEWER THE RUE
PIERRE A POISSON THROUGH THE SEWER DE LA SONNERIE THE RUE POPINCOURT
THROUGH THE SEWER OF THE CHEMIN VERT THE RUE DE LA ROQUETTE THROUGH
THE SEWER OF THE RUE DE LAPPE IT COVERED THE DRAIN OF THE RUE DES
CHAMPS ELYSEES TO THE HEIGHT OF THIRTY FIVE CENTIMETRES AND TO THE
SOUTH THROUGH THE VENT OF THE SEINE PERFORMING ITS FUNCTIONS IN
INVERSE SENSE IT PENETRATED THE RUE MAZARINE THE RUE DE L'ECHAUDE AND
THE RUE DES MARAIS WHERE IT STOPPED AT A DISTANCE OF ONE HUNDRED AND
NINE METRES A FEW PACES DISTANT FROM THE HOUSE IN WHICH RACINE HAD
LIVED RESPECTING IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE POET MORE THAN THE
KING
IT ATTAINED ITS MAXIMUM DEPTH IN THE RUE SAINT PIERRE WHERE
IT ROSE TO THE HEIGHT OF THREE FEET ABOVE THE FLAG STONES OF THE
WATER SPOUT AND ITS MAXIMUM LENGTH IN THE RUE SAINT SABIN WHERE IT
SPREAD OUT OVER A STRETCH TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT METRES IN LENGTH
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY THE SEWER OF PARIS WAS STILL A
MYSTERIOUS PLACE
MUD CAN NEVER ENJOY A GOOD FAME BUT IN THIS CASE ITS
EVIL RENOWN REACHED THE VERGE OF THE TERRIBLE
PARIS KNEW IN A CONFUSED
WAY THAT SHE HAD UNDER HER A TERRIBLE CAVERN
PEOPLE TALKED OF IT AS
OF THAT MONSTROUS BED OF THEBES IN WHICH SWARMED CENTIPEDES FIFTEEN LONG
FEET IN LENGTH AND WHICH MIGHT HAVE SERVED BEHEMOTH FOR A BATHTUB
THE GREAT BOOTS OF THE SEWERMEN NEVER VENTURED FURTHER THAN CERTAIN
WELL KNOWN POINTS
WE WERE THEN VERY NEAR THE EPOCH WHEN THE SCAVENGER'S
CARTS FROM THE SUMMIT OF WHICH SAINTE FOIX FRATERNIZED WITH THE MARQUIS
DE CREQUI DISCHARGED THEIR LOADS DIRECTLY INTO THE SEWER
AS FOR
CLEANING OUT THAT FUNCTION WAS ENTRUSTED TO THE POURING RAINS WHICH
ENCUMBERED RATHER THAN SWEPT AWAY
ROME LEFT SOME POETRY TO HER SEWER
AND CALLED IT THE GEMONIAE PARIS INSULTED HERS AND ENTITLED IT THE
POLYPUS HOLE
SCIENCE AND SUPERSTITION WERE IN ACCORD IN HORROR
THE
POLYPUS HOLE WAS NO LESS REPUGNANT TO HYGIENE THAN TO LEGEND
THE GOBLIN
WAS DEVELOPED UNDER THE FETID COVERING OF THE MOUFFETARD SEWER THE
CORPSES OF THE MARMOUSETS HAD BEEN CAST INTO THE SEWER DE LA BARILLERIE
FAGON ATTRIBUTED THE REDOUBTABLE MALIGNANT FEVER OF 1685 TO THE GREAT
HIATUS OF THE SEWER OF THE MARAIS WHICH REMAINED YAWNING UNTIL 1833 IN
THE RUE SAINT LOUIS ALMOST OPPOSITE THE SIGN OF THE GALLANT MESSENGER
THE MOUTH OF THE SEWER OF THE RUE DE LA MORTELLERIE WAS CELEBRATED FOR
THE PESTILENCES WHICH HAD THEIR SOURCE THERE WITH ITS GRATING OF IRON
WITH POINTS SIMULATING A ROW OF TEETH IT WAS LIKE A DRAGON'S MAW
IN THAT FATAL STREET BREATHING FORTH HELL UPON MEN
THE POPULAR
IMAGINATION SEASONED THE SOMBRE PARISIAN SINK WITH SOME INDESCRIBABLY
HIDEOUS INTERMIXTURE OF THE INFINITE
THE SEWER HAD NO BOTTOM
THE SEWER
WAS THE LOWER WORLD
THE IDEA OF EXPLORING THESE LEPROUS REGIONS DID NOT
EVEN OCCUR TO THE POLICE
TO TRY THAT UNKNOWN THING TO CAST THE PLUMMET
INTO THAT SHADOW TO SET OUT ON A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY IN THAT ABYSS WHO
WOULD HAVE DARED IT WAS ALARMING
NEVERTHELESS SOME ONE DID PRESENT
HIMSELF
THE CESS POOL HAD ITS CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS
ONE DAY IN 1805 DURING ONE OF THE RARE APPARITIONS WHICH THE EMPEROR
MADE IN PARIS THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR SOME DECRES OR CRETET OR
OTHER CAME TO THE MASTER'S INTIMATE LEVEE
IN THE CARROUSEL THERE WAS
AUDIBLE THE CLANKING OF SWORDS OF ALL THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SOLDIERS OF
THE GREAT REPUBLIC AND OF THE GREAT EMPIRE THEN NAPOLEON'S DOOR WAS
BLOCKED WITH HEROES MEN FROM THE RHINE FROM THE ESCAUT FROM THE
ADIGE AND FROM THE NILE COMPANIONS OF JOUBERT OF DESAIX OF MARCEAU
OF HOCHE OF KLEBER THE AEROSTIERS OF FLEURUS THE GRENADIERS OF
MAYENCE THE PONTOON BUILDERS OF GENOA HUSSARS WHOM THE PYRAMIDS HAD
LOOKED DOWN UPON ARTILLERISTS WHOM JUNOT'S CANNON BALL HAD SPATTERED
WITH MUD CUIRASSIERS WHO HAD TAKEN BY ASSAULT THE FLEET LYING AT ANCHOR
IN THE ZUYDERZEE SOME HAD FOLLOWED BONAPARTE UPON THE BRIDGE OF LODI
OTHERS HAD ACCOMPANIED MURAT IN THE TRENCHES OF MANTUA OTHERS HAD
PRECEDED LANNES IN THE HOLLOW ROAD OF MONTEBELLO
THE WHOLE ARMY OF THAT
DAY WAS PRESENT THERE IN THE COURT YARD OF THE TUILERIES REPRESENTED
BY A SQUADRON OR A PLATOON AND GUARDING NAPOLEON IN REPOSE AND THAT
WAS THE SPLENDID EPOCH WHEN THE GRAND ARMY HAD MARENGO BEHIND IT AND
AUSTERLITZ BEFORE IT SIRE SAID THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR TO
NAPOLEON YESTERDAY I SAW THE MOST INTREPID MAN IN YOUR EMPIRE WHAT
MAN IS THAT SAID THE EMPEROR BRUSQUELY AND WHAT HAS HE DONE HE
WANTS TO DO SOMETHING SIRE WHAT IS IT TO VISIT THE SEWERS OF
PARIS
THIS MAN EXISTED AND HIS NAME WAS BRUNESEAU
CHAPTER IV BRUNESEAU
THE VISIT TOOK PLACE
IT WAS A FORMIDABLE CAMPAIGN A NOCTURNAL BATTLE
AGAINST PESTILENCE AND SUFFOCATION
IT WAS AT THE SAME TIME A VOYAGE
OF DISCOVERY
ONE OF THE SURVIVORS OF THIS EXPEDITION AN INTELLIGENT
WORKINGMAN WHO WAS VERY YOUNG AT THE TIME RELATED CURIOUS DETAILS WITH
REGARD TO IT SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHICH BRUNESEAU THOUGHT HIMSELF OBLIGED
TO OMIT IN HIS REPORT TO THE PREFECT OF POLICE AS UNWORTHY OF OFFICIAL
STYLE
THE PROCESSES OF DISINFECTION WERE AT THAT EPOCH EXTREMELY
RUDIMENTARY
HARDLY HAD BRUNESEAU CROSSED THE FIRST ARTICULATIONS OF
THAT SUBTERRANEAN NETWORK WHEN EIGHT LABORERS OUT OF THE TWENTY REFUSED
TO GO ANY FURTHER
THE OPERATION WAS COMPLICATED THE VISIT ENTAILED THE
NECESSITY OF CLEANING HENCE IT WAS NECESSARY TO CLEANSE AND AT THE SAME
TIME TO PROCEED TO NOTE THE ENTRANCES OF WATER TO COUNT THE GRATINGS
AND THE VENTS TO LAY OUT IN DETAIL THE BRANCHES TO INDICATE THE
CURRENTS AT THE POINT WHERE THEY PARTED TO DEFINE THE RESPECTIVE BOUNDS
OF THE DIVERS BASINS TO SOUND THE SMALL SEWERS GRAFTED ON THE PRINCIPAL
SEWER TO MEASURE THE HEIGHT UNDER THE KEY STONE OF EACH DRAIN AND THE
WIDTH AT THE SPRING OF THE VAULTS AS WELL AS AT THE BOTTOM IN ORDER
TO DETERMINE THE ARRANGEMENTS WITH REGARD TO THE LEVEL OF EACH
WATER ENTRANCE EITHER OF THE BOTTOM OF THE ARCH OR ON THE SOIL OF THE
STREET
THEY ADVANCED WITH TOIL
THE LANTERNS PINED AWAY IN THE FOUL
ATMOSPHERE
FROM TIME TO TIME A FAINTING SEWERMAN WAS CARRIED OUT
AT CERTAIN POINTS THERE WERE PRECIPICES
THE SOIL HAD GIVEN AWAY THE
PAVEMENT HAD CRUMBLED THE SEWER HAD CHANGED INTO A BOTTOMLESS WELL
THEY FOUND NOTHING SOLID A MAN DISAPPEARED SUDDENLY THEY HAD GREAT
DIFFICULTY IN GETTING HIM OUT AGAIN
ON THE ADVICE OF FOURCROY THEY
LIGHTED LARGE CAGES FILLED WITH TOW STEEPED IN RESIN FROM TIME TO TIME
IN SPOTS WHICH HAD BEEN SUFFICIENTLY DISINFECTED
IN SOME PLACES THE
WALL WAS COVERED WITH MISSHAPEN FUNGI ONE WOULD HAVE SAID TUMORS THE
VERY STONE SEEMED DISEASED WITHIN THIS UNBREATHABLE ATMOSPHERE
BRUNESEAU IN HIS EXPLORATION PROCEEDED DOWN HILL
AT THE POINT OF
SEPARATION OF THE TWO WATER CONDUITS OF THE GRAND HURLEUR HE DECIPHERED
UPON A PROJECTING STONE THE DATE OF 1550 THIS STONE INDICATED THE
LIMITS WHERE PHILIBERT DELORME CHARGED BY HENRI II
WITH VISITING THE
SUBTERRANEAN DRAINS OF PARIS HAD HALTED
THIS STONE WAS THE MARK OF
THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY ON THE SEWER BRUNESEAU FOUND THE HANDIWORK OF
THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ONCE MORE IN THE PONCEAU DRAIN OF THE OLD RUE
VIELLE DU TEMPLE VAULTED BETWEEN 1600 AND 1650 AND THE HANDIWORK OF
THE EIGHTEENTH IN THE WESTERN SECTION OF THE COLLECTING CANAL WALLED
AND VAULTED IN 1740
THESE TWO VAULTS ESPECIALLY THE LESS ANCIENT THAT
OF 1740 WERE MORE CRACKED AND DECREPIT THAN THE MASONRY OF THE BELT
SEWER WHICH DATED FROM 1412 AN EPOCH WHEN THE BROOK OF FRESH WATER OF
MENILMONTANT WAS ELEVATED TO THE DIGNITY OF THE GRAND SEWER OF PARIS AN
ADVANCEMENT ANALOGOUS TO THAT OF A PEASANT WHO SHOULD BECOME FIRST VALET
DE CHAMBRE TO THE KING SOMETHING LIKE GROS JEAN TRANSFORMED INTO LEBEL
HERE AND THERE PARTICULARLY BENEATH THE COURT HOUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY
RECOGNIZED THE HOLLOWS OF ANCIENT DUNGEONS EXCAVATED IN THE VERY SEWER
ITSELF
HIDEOUS PLACE AN IRON NECK COLLAR WAS HANGING IN ONE OF THESE
CELLS
THEY WALLED THEM ALL UP
SOME OF THEIR FINDS WERE SINGULAR AMONG
OTHERS THE SKELETON OF AN OURANG OUTAN WHO HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE
JARDIN DES PLANTES IN 1800 A DISAPPEARANCE PROBABLY CONNECTED WITH
THE FAMOUS AND INDISPUTABLE APPARITION OF THE DEVIL IN THE RUE DES
BERNARDINS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
THE POOR DEVIL
HAD ENDED BY DROWNING HIMSELF IN THE SEWER
BENEATH THIS LONG ARCHED DRAIN WHICH TERMINATED AT THE ARCHE MARION
A PERFECTLY PRESERVED RAG PICKER'S BASKET EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF ALL
CONNOISSEURS
EVERYWHERE THE MIRE WHICH THE SEWERMEN CAME TO HANDLE
WITH INTREPIDITY ABOUNDED IN PRECIOUS OBJECTS JEWELS OF GOLD AND
SILVER PRECIOUS STONES COINS
IF A GIANT HAD FILTERED THIS CESSPOOL
HE WOULD HAVE HAD THE RICHES OF CENTURIES IN HIS LAIR
AT THE POINT
WHERE THE TWO BRANCHES OF THE RUE DU TEMPLE AND OF THE RUE SAINTE AVOYE
SEPARATE THEY PICKED UP A SINGULAR HUGUENOT MEDAL IN COPPER BEARING ON
ONE SIDE THE PIG HOODED WITH A CARDINAL'S HAT AND ON THE OTHER A WOLF
WITH A TIARA ON HIS HEAD
THE MOST SURPRISING ENCOUNTER WAS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE GRAND SEWER
THIS ENTRANCE HAD FORMERLY BEEN CLOSED BY A GRATING OF WHICH NOTHING BUT
THE HINGES REMAINED
FROM ONE OF THESE HINGES HUNG A DIRTY AND SHAPELESS
RAG WHICH ARRESTED THERE IN ITS PASSAGE NO DOUBT HAD FLOATED THERE
IN THE DARKNESS AND FINISHED ITS PROCESS OF BEING TORN APART
BRUNESEAU
HELD HIS LANTERN CLOSE TO THIS RAG AND EXAMINED IT
IT WAS OF VERY FINE
BATISTE AND IN ONE OF THE CORNERS LESS FRAYED THAN THE REST THEY
MADE OUT A HERALDIC CORONET AND EMBROIDERED ABOVE THESE SEVEN LETTERS
LAVBESP
THE CROWN WAS THE CORONET OF A MARQUIS AND THE SEVEN LETTERS
SIGNIFIED LAUBESPINE
THEY RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT WHAT THEY HAD
BEFORE THEIR EYES WAS A MORSEL OF THE SHROUD OF MARAT
MARAT IN HIS
YOUTH HAD HAD AMOROUS INTRIGUES
THIS WAS WHEN HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE
HOUSEHOLD OF THE COMTE D'ARTOIS IN THE CAPACITY OF PHYSICIAN TO THE
STABLES
FROM THESE LOVE AFFAIRS HISTORICALLY PROVED WITH A GREAT
LADY HE HAD RETAINED THIS SHEET
AS A WAIF OR A SOUVENIR
AT HIS DEATH
AS THIS WAS THE ONLY LINEN OF ANY FINENESS WHICH HE HAD IN HIS HOUSE
THEY BURIED HIM IN IT
SOME OLD WOMEN HAD SHROUDED HIM FOR THE TOMB IN
THAT SWADDLING BAND IN WHICH THE TRAGIC FRIEND OF THE PEOPLE HAD ENJOYED
VOLUPTUOUSNESS
BRUNESEAU PASSED ON
THEY LEFT THAT RAG WHERE IT HUNG
THEY DID NOT PUT THE FINISHING TOUCH TO IT
DID THIS ARISE FROM SCORN
OR FROM RESPECT MARAT DESERVED BOTH
AND THEN DESTINY WAS THERE
SUFFICIENTLY STAMPED TO MAKE THEM HESITATE TO TOUCH IT
BESIDES THE
THINGS OF THE SEPULCHRE MUST BE LEFT IN THE SPOT WHICH THEY SELECT
IN
SHORT THE RELIC WAS A STRANGE ONE
A MARQUISE HAD SLEPT IN IT MARAT
HAD ROTTED IN IT IT HAD TRAVERSED THE PANTHEON TO END WITH THE RATS
OF THE SEWER
THIS CHAMBER RAG OF WHICH WATTEAU WOULD FORMERLY HAVE
JOYFULLY SKETCHED EVERY FOLD HAD ENDED IN BECOMING WORTHY OF THE FIXED
GAZE OF DANTE
THE WHOLE VISIT TO THE SUBTERRANEAN STREAM OF FILTH OF PARIS LASTED
SEVEN YEARS FROM 1805 TO 1812
AS HE PROCEEDED BRUNESEAU DREW
DIRECTED AND COMPLETED CONSIDERABLE WORKS IN 1808 HE LOWERED THE ARCH
OF THE PONCEAU AND EVERYWHERE CREATING NEW LINES HE PUSHED THE
SEWER IN 1809 UNDER THE RUE SAINT DENIS AS FAR AS THE FOUNTAIN OF
THE INNOCENTS IN 1810 UNDER THE RUE FROIDMANTEAU AND UNDER THE
SALPETRIERE IN 1811 UNDER THE RUE NEUVE DES PETITS PERES UNDER THE RUE
DU MAIL UNDER THE RUE DE L'ECHARPE UNDER THE PLACE ROYALE IN 1812
UNDER THE RUE DE LA PAIX AND UNDER THE CHAUSSEE D'ANTIN
AT THE SAME
TIME HE HAD THE WHOLE NET WORK DISINFECTED AND RENDERED HEALTHFUL
IN
THE SECOND YEAR OF HIS WORK BRUNESEAU ENGAGED THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS
SON IN LAW NARGAUD
IT WAS THUS THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY ANCIENT SOCIETY
CLEANSED ITS DOUBLE BOTTOM AND PERFORMED THE TOILET OF ITS SEWER
THERE
WAS THAT MUCH CLEAN AT ALL EVENTS
TORTUOUS CRACKED UNPAVED FULL OF FISSURES INTERSECTED BY GULLIES
JOLTED BY ECCENTRIC ELBOWS MOUNTING AND DESCENDING ILLOGICALLY FETID
WILD FIERCE SUBMERGED IN OBSCURITY WITH CICATRICES ON ITS PAVEMENTS
AND SCARS ON ITS WALLS TERRIBLE SUCH WAS RETROSPECTIVELY VIEWED THE
ANTIQUE SEWER OF PARIS
RAMIFICATIONS IN EVERY DIRECTION CROSSINGS
OF TRENCHES BRANCHES GOOSE FEET STARS AS IN MILITARY MINES COECUM
BLIND ALLEYS VAULTS LINED WITH SALTPETRE PESTIFEROUS POOLS SCABBY
SWEATS ON THE WALLS DROPS DRIPPING FROM THE CEILINGS DARKNESS
NOTHING COULD EQUAL THE HORROR OF THIS OLD WASTE CRYPT THE DIGESTIVE
APPARATUS OF BABYLON A CAVERN DITCH GULF PIERCED WITH STREETS A
TITANIC MOLE BURROW WHERE THE MIND SEEMS TO BEHOLD THAT ENORMOUS BLIND
MOLE THE PAST PROWLING THROUGH THE SHADOWS IN THE FILTH WHICH HAS
BEEN SPLENDOR
THIS WE REPEAT WAS THE SEWER OF THE PAST
CHAPTER V PRESENT PROGRESS
TO DAY THE SEWER IS CLEAN COLD STRAIGHT CORRECT
IT ALMOST REALIZES
THE IDEAL OF WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD IN ENGLAND BY THE WORD RESPECTABLE IT
IS PROPER AND GRAYISH LAID OUT BY RULE AND LINE ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY
AS THOUGH IT CAME OUT OF A BANDBOX
IT RESEMBLES A TRADESMAN WHO HAS
BECOME A COUNCILLOR OF STATE
ONE CAN ALMOST SEE DISTINCTLY THERE
THE
MIRE THERE COMPORTS ITSELF WITH DECENCY
AT FIRST ONE MIGHT READILY
MISTAKE IT FOR ONE OF THOSE SUBTERRANEAN CORRIDORS WHICH WERE SO COMMON
IN FORMER DAYS AND SO USEFUL IN FLIGHTS OF MONARCHS AND PRINCES IN
THOSE GOOD OLD TIMES WHEN THE PEOPLE LOVED THEIR KINGS THE PRESENT
SEWER IS A BEAUTIFUL SEWER THE PURE STYLE REIGNS THERE THE CLASSICAL
RECTILINEAR ALEXANDRINE WHICH DRIVEN OUT OF POETRY APPEARS TO HAVE
TAKEN REFUGE IN ARCHITECTURE SEEMS MINGLED WITH ALL THE STONES OF
THAT LONG DARK AND WHITISH VAULT EACH OUTLET IS AN ARCADE THE RUE DE
RIVOLI SERVES AS PATTERN EVEN IN THE SEWER
HOWEVER IF THE GEOMETRICAL
LINE IS IN PLACE ANYWHERE IT IS CERTAINLY IN THE DRAINAGE TRENCH OF
A GREAT CITY
THERE EVERYTHING SHOULD BE SUBORDINATED TO THE SHORTEST
ROAD
THE SEWER HAS NOWADAYS ASSUMED A CERTAIN OFFICIAL ASPECT
THE
VERY POLICE REPORTS OF WHICH IT SOMETIMES FORMS THE SUBJECT NO LONGER
ARE WANTING IN RESPECT TOWARDS IT
THE WORDS WHICH CHARACTERIZE IT IN
ADMINISTRATIVE LANGUAGE ARE SONOROUS AND DIGNIFIED
WHAT USED TO BE
CALLED A GUT IS NOW CALLED A GALLERY WHAT USED TO BE CALLED A HOLE IS
NOW CALLED A SURVEYING ORIFICE
VILLON WOULD NO LONGER MEET WITH HIS
ANCIENT TEMPORARY PROVISIONAL LODGING
THIS NET WORK OF CELLARS HAS ITS
IMMEMORIAL POPULATION OF PROWLERS RODENTS SWARMING IN GREATER NUMBERS
THAN EVER FROM TIME TO TIME AN AGED AND VETERAN RAT RISKS HIS HEAD AT
THE WINDOW OF THE SEWER AND SURVEYS THE PARISIANS BUT EVEN THESE VERMIN
GROW TAME SO SATISFIED ARE THEY WITH THEIR SUBTERRANEAN PALACE
THE
CESSPOOL NO LONGER RETAINS ANYTHING OF ITS PRIMITIVE FEROCITY
THE RAIN
WHICH IN FORMER DAYS SOILED THE SEWER NOW WASHES IT
NEVERTHELESS DO
NOT TRUST YOURSELF TOO MUCH TO IT
MIASMAS STILL INHABIT IT
IT IS
MORE HYPOCRITICAL THAN IRREPROACHABLE
THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE AND
THE COMMISSION OF HEALTH HAVE DONE THEIR BEST
BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THE
PROCESSES OF DISINFECTION IT EXHALES A VAGUE SUSPICIOUS ODOR LIKE
TARTUFFE AFTER CONFESSION
LET US CONFESS THAT TAKING IT ALL IN ALL THIS SWEEPING IS A HOMAGE
WHICH THE SEWER PAYS TO CIVILIZATION AND AS FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW
TARTUFFE'S CONSCIENCE IS A PROGRESS OVER THE AUGEAN STABLES IT IS
CERTAIN THAT THE SEWERS OF PARIS HAVE BEEN IMPROVED
IT IS MORE THAN PROGRESS IT IS TRANSMUTATION
BETWEEN THE ANCIENT
AND THE PRESENT SEWER THERE IS A REVOLUTION
WHAT HAS EFFECTED THIS
REVOLUTION
THE MAN WHOM ALL THE WORLD FORGETS AND WHOM WE HAVE MENTIONED
BRUNESEAU
CHAPTER VI FUTURE PROGRESS
THE EXCAVATION OF THE SEWER OF PARIS HAS BEEN NO SLIGHT TASK
THE LAST
TEN CENTURIES HAVE TOILED AT IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO BRING IT TO A
TERMINATION ANY MORE THAN THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH PARIS
THE
SEWER IN FACT RECEIVES ALL THE COUNTER SHOCKS OF THE GROWTH OF PARIS
WITHIN THE BOSOM OF THE EARTH IT IS A SORT OF MYSTERIOUS POLYP WITH A
THOUSAND ANTENNAE WHICH EXPANDS BELOW AS THE CITY EXPANDS ABOVE
EVERY
TIME THAT THE CITY CUTS A STREET THE SEWER STRETCHES OUT AN ARM
THE
OLD MONARCHY HAD CONSTRUCTED ONLY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED
METRES OF SEWERS THAT WAS WHERE PARIS STOOD IN THIS RESPECT ON THE
FIRST OF JANUARY 1806
BEGINNING WITH THIS EPOCH OF WHICH WE SHALL
SHORTLY SPEAK THE WORK WAS USEFULLY AND ENERGETICALLY RESUMED AND
PROSECUTED NAPOLEON BUILT THE FIGURES ARE CURIOUS FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT
HUNDRED AND FOUR METRES LOUIS XVIII FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED
AND NINE CHARLES X TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX
LOUIS PHILIPPE EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND AND TWENTY THE REPUBLIC OF
1848 TWENTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE THE PRESENT
GOVERNMENT SEVENTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IN ALL AT THE PRESENT TIME
TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TEN METRES
SIXTY LEAGUES OF SEWERS THE ENORMOUS ENTRAILS OF PARIS
AN OBSCURE
RAMIFICATION EVER AT WORK A CONSTRUCTION WHICH IS IMMENSE AND IGNORED
AS THE READER SEES THE SUBTERRANEAN LABYRINTH OF PARIS IS TO DAY
MORE THAN TEN TIMES WHAT IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY
IT IS
DIFFICULT TO FORM ANY IDEA OF ALL THE PERSEVERANCE AND THE EFFORTS WHICH
HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO BRING THIS CESS POOL TO THE POINT OF RELATIVE
PERFECTION IN WHICH IT NOW IS
IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT THE
ANCIENT MONARCHICAL PROVOSTSHIP AND DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS OF
THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE REVOLUTIONARY MAYORALTY HAD SUCCEEDED IN
PERFORATING THE FIVE LEAGUES OF SEWER WHICH EXISTED PREVIOUS TO 1806
ALL SORTS OF OBSTACLES HINDERED THIS OPERATION SOME PECULIAR TO THE
SOIL OTHERS INHERENT IN THE VERY PREJUDICES OF THE LABORIOUS POPULATION
OF PARIS
PARIS IS BUILT UPON A SOIL WHICH IS SINGULARLY REBELLIOUS TO
THE PICK THE HOE THE BORE AND TO HUMAN MANIPULATION
THERE IS NOTHING
MORE DIFFICULT TO PIERCE AND TO PENETRATE THAN THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION
UPON WHICH IS SUPERPOSED THE MARVELLOUS HISTORICAL FORMATION CALLED
PARIS AS SOON AS WORK IN ANY FORM WHATSOEVER IS BEGUN AND ADVENTURES
UPON THIS STRETCH OF ALLUVIUM SUBTERRANEAN RESISTANCES ABOUND
THERE
ARE LIQUID CLAYS SPRINGS HARD ROCKS AND THOSE SOFT AND DEEP QUAGMIRES
WHICH SPECIAL SCIENCE CALLS MOUTARDES 59 THE PICK ADVANCES LABORIOUSLY
THROUGH THE CALCAREOUS LAYERS ALTERNATING WITH VERY SLENDER THREADS OF
CLAY AND SCHISTOSE BEDS IN PLATES INCRUSTED WITH OYSTER SHELLS THE
CONTEMPORARIES OF THE PRE ADAMITE OCEANS
SOMETIMES A RIVULET SUDDENLY
BURSTS THROUGH A VAULT THAT HAS BEEN BEGUN AND INUNDATES THE LABORERS
OR A LAYER OF MARL IS LAID BARE AND ROLLS DOWN WITH THE FURY OF A
CATARACT BREAKING THE STOUTEST SUPPORTING BEAMS LIKE GLASS
QUITE
RECENTLY AT VILLETTE WHEN IT BECAME NECESSARY TO PASS THE COLLECTING
SEWER UNDER THE SAINT MARTIN CANAL WITHOUT INTERRUPTING NAVIGATION OR
EMPTYING THE CANAL A FISSURE APPEARED IN THE BASIN OF THE CANAL WATER
SUDDENLY BECAME ABUNDANT IN THE SUBTERRANEAN TUNNEL WHICH WAS BEYOND
THE POWER OF THE PUMPING ENGINES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SEND A DIVER TO
EXPLORE THE FISSURE WHICH HAD BEEN MADE IN THE NARROW ENTRANCE OF THE
GRAND BASIN AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT IT WAS STOPPED
UP
ELSEWHERE NEAR THE SEINE AND EVEN AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE
FROM THE RIVER AS FOR INSTANCE AT BELLEVILLE GRAND RUE AND LUMIERE
PASSAGE QUICKSANDS ARE ENCOUNTERED IN WHICH ONE STICKS FAST AND IN
WHICH A MAN SINKS VISIBLY
ADD SUFFOCATION BY MIASMAS BURIAL BY SLIDES
AND SUDDEN CRUMBLING OF THE EARTH
ADD THE TYPHUS WITH WHICH THE
WORKMEN BECOME SLOWLY IMPREGNATED
IN OUR OWN DAY AFTER HAVING
EXCAVATED THE GALLERY OF CLICHY WITH A BANQUETTE TO RECEIVE THE
PRINCIPAL WATER CONDUIT OF OURCQ A PIECE OF WORK WHICH WAS EXECUTED IN
A TRENCH TEN METRES DEEP AFTER HAVING IN THE MIDST OF LAND SLIDES AND
WITH THE AID OF EXCAVATIONS OFTEN PUTRID AND OF SHORING UP VAULTED
THE BIEVRE FROM THE BOULEVARD DE L'HOPITAL AS FAR AS THE SEINE AFTER
HAVING IN ORDER TO DELIVER PARIS FROM THE FLOODS OF MONTMARTRE AND IN
ORDER TO PROVIDE AN OUTLET FOR THAT RIVER LIKE POOL NINE HECTARES IN
EXTENT WHICH CROUCHED NEAR THE BARRIERE DES MARTYRS AFTER HAVING LET
US STATE CONSTRUCTED THE LINE OF SEWERS FROM THE BARRIERE BLANCHE TO
THE ROAD OF AUBERVILLIERS IN FOUR MONTHS WORKING DAY AND NIGHT AT A
DEPTH OF ELEVEN METRES AFTER HAVING A THING HERETOFORE UNSEEN MADE A
SUBTERRANEAN SEWER IN THE RUE BARRE DU BEC WITHOUT A TRENCH SIX
METRES BELOW THE SURFACE THE SUPERINTENDENT MONNOT DIED
AFTER HAVING
VAULTED THREE THOUSAND METRES OF SEWER IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE CITY FROM
THE RUE TRAVERSIERE SAINT ANTOINE TO THE RUE DE L'OURCINE AFTER HAVING
FREED THE CARREFOUR CENSIER MOUFFETARD FROM INUNDATIONS OF RAIN BY MEANS
OF THE BRANCH OF THE ARBALETE AFTER HAVING BUILT THE SAINT GEORGES
SEWER ON ROCK AND CONCRETE IN THE FLUID SANDS AFTER HAVING DIRECTED
THE FORMIDABLE LOWERING OF THE FLOORING OF THE VAULT TIMBER IN THE
NOTRE DAME DE NAZARETH BRANCH DULEAU THE ENGINEER DIED
THERE ARE NO
BULLETINS FOR SUCH ACTS OF BRAVERY AS THESE WHICH ARE MORE USEFUL
NEVERTHELESS THAN THE BRUTAL SLAUGHTER OF THE FIELD OF BATTLE
THE SEWERS OF PARIS IN 1832 WERE FAR FROM BEING WHAT THEY ARE TO DAY
BRUNESEAU HAD GIVEN THE IMPULSE BUT THE CHOLERA WAS REQUIRED TO
BRING ABOUT THE VAST RECONSTRUCTION WHICH TOOK PLACE LATER ON
IT IS
SURPRISING TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT IN 1821 A PART OF THE BELT SEWER
CALLED THE GRAND CANAL AS IN VENICE STILL STOOD STAGNATING UNCOVERED
TO THE SKY IN THE RUE DES GOURDES
IT WAS ONLY IN 1821 THAT THE CITY
OF PARIS FOUND IN ITS POCKET THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND EIGHTY
FRANCS AND SIX CENTIMES REQUIRED FOR COVERING THIS MASS OF FILTH
THE
THREE ABSORBING WELLS OF THE COMBAT THE CUNETTE AND SAINT MANDE WITH
THEIR DISCHARGING MOUTHS THEIR APPARATUS THEIR CESSPOOLS AND THEIR
DEPURATORY BRANCHES ONLY DATE FROM 1836
THE INTESTINAL SEWER OF PARIS
HAS BEEN MADE OVER ANEW AND AS WE HAVE SAID IT HAS BEEN EXTENDED MORE
THAN TENFOLD WITHIN THE LAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY
THIRTY YEARS AGO AT THE EPOCH OF THE INSURRECTION OF THE 5TH AND 6TH OF
JUNE IT WAS STILL IN MANY LOCALITIES NEARLY THE SAME ANCIENT SEWER
A VERY GREAT NUMBER OF STREETS WHICH ARE NOW CONVEX WERE THEN SUNKEN
CAUSEWAYS
AT THE END OF A SLOPE WHERE THE TRIBUTARIES OF A STREET OR
CROSS ROADS ENDED THERE WERE OFTEN TO BE SEEN LARGE SQUARE GRATINGS
WITH HEAVY BARS WHOSE IRON POLISHED BY THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE THRONG
GLEAMED DANGEROUS AND SLIPPERY FOR VEHICLES AND CAUSED HORSES TO FALL
THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE ROADS AND BRIDGES GAVE TO THESE GRATINGS
THE EXPRESSIVE NAME OF CASSIS 60
IN 1832 IN A NUMBER OF STREETS IN THE RUE DE L'ETOILE THE RUE
SAINT LOUIS THE RUE DU TEMPLE THE RUE VIELLE DUTEMPLE THE RUE
NOTRE DAME DE NAZARETH THE RUE FOLIE MERICOURT THE QUAI AUX FLEURS
THE RUE DU PETIT MUSE THE RUE DU NORMANDIE THE RUE PONT AUX BICHES
THE RUE DES MARAIS THE FAUBOURG SAINT MARTIN THE RUE NOTRE DAME
DES VICTOIRES THE FAUBOURG MONTMARTRE THE RUE GRANGE BATELIERE IN THE
CHAMPS ELYSEES THE RUE JACOB THE RUE DE TOURNON THE ANCIENT GOTHIC
SEWER STILL CYNICALLY DISPLAYED ITS MAW
IT CONSISTED OF ENORMOUS
VOIDS OF STONE CATCH BASINS SOMETIMES SURROUNDED BY STONE POSTS WITH
MONUMENTAL EFFRONTERY
PARIS IN 1806 STILL HAD NEARLY THE SAME SEWERS NUMERICALLY AS STATED IN
1663 FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS
AFTER BRUNESEAU ON THE 1ST
OF JANUARY 1832 IT HAD FORTY THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED METRES
BETWEEN
1806 AND 1831 THERE HAD BEEN BUILT ON AN AVERAGE SEVEN HUNDRED AND
FIFTY METRES ANNUALLY AFTERWARDS EIGHT AND EVEN TEN THOUSAND METRES OF
GALLERIES WERE CONSTRUCTED EVERY YEAR IN MASONRY OF SMALL STONES WITH
HYDRAULIC MORTAR WHICH HARDENS UNDER WATER ON A CEMENT FOUNDATION
AT
TWO HUNDRED FRANCS THE METRE THE SIXTY LEAGUES OF PARIS' SEWERS OF THE
PRESENT DAY REPRESENT FORTY EIGHT MILLIONS
IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC PROGRESS WHICH WE HAVE INDICATED AT THE
BEGINNING GRAVE PROBLEMS OF PUBLIC HYGIENE ARE CONNECTED WITH THAT
IMMENSE QUESTION THE SEWERS OF PARIS
PARIS IS THE CENTRE OF TWO SHEETS A SHEET OF WATER AND A SHEET OF AIR
THE SHEET OF WATER LYING AT A TOLERABLY GREAT DEPTH UNDERGROUND BUT
ALREADY SOUNDED BY TWO BORES IS FURNISHED BY THE LAYER OF GREEN CLAY
SITUATED BETWEEN THE CHALK AND THE JURASSIC LIME STONE THIS LAYER MAY
BE REPRESENTED BY A DISK FIVE AND TWENTY LEAGUES IN CIRCUMFERENCE A
MULTITUDE OF RIVERS AND BROOKS OOZE THERE ONE DRINKS THE SEINE THE
MARNE THE YONNE THE OISE THE AISNE THE CHER THE VIENNE AND THE
LOIRE IN A GLASS OF WATER FROM THE WELL OF GRENELLE
THE SHEET OF WATER
IS HEALTHY IT COMES FROM HEAVEN IN THE FIRST PLACE AND NEXT FROM THE
EARTH THE SHEET OF AIR IS UNHEALTHY IT COMES FROM THE SEWER
ALL THE
MIASMS OF THE CESS POOL ARE MINGLED WITH THE BREATH OF THE CITY HENCE
THIS BAD BREATH
THE AIR TAKEN FROM ABOVE A DUNG HEAP AS HAS BEEN
SCIENTIFICALLY PROVED IS PURER THAN THE AIR TAKEN FROM ABOVE PARIS
IN
A GIVEN TIME WITH THE AID OF PROGRESS MECHANISMS BECOME PERFECTED AND
AS LIGHT INCREASES THE SHEET OF WATER WILL BE EMPLOYED TO PURIFY THE
SHEET OF AIR THAT IS TO SAY TO WASH THE SEWER
THE READER KNOWS THAT
BY WASHING THE SEWER WE MEAN THE RESTITUTION OF THE FILTH TO THE
EARTH THE RETURN TO THE SOIL OF DUNG AND OF MANURE TO THE FIELDS
THROUGH THIS SIMPLE ACT THE ENTIRE SOCIAL COMMUNITY WILL EXPERIENCE A
DIMINUTION OF MISERY AND AN AUGMENTATION OF HEALTH
AT THE PRESENT HOUR
THE RADIATION OF DISEASES FROM PARIS EXTENDS TO FIFTY LEAGUES AROUND THE
LOUVRE TAKEN AS THE HUB OF THIS PESTILENTIAL WHEEL
WE MIGHT SAY THAT FOR TEN CENTURIES THE CESS POOL HAS BEEN THE DISEASE
OF PARIS
THE SEWER IS THE BLEMISH WHICH PARIS HAS IN HER BLOOD
THE
POPULAR INSTINCT HAS NEVER BEEN DECEIVED IN IT
THE OCCUPATION OF
SEWERMEN WAS FORMERLY ALMOST AS PERILOUS AND ALMOST AS REPUGNANT TO THE
PEOPLE AS THE OCCUPATION OF KNACKER WHICH WAS SO LONG HELD IN HORROR
AND HANDED OVER TO THE EXECUTIONER
HIGH WAGES WERE NECESSARY TO INDUCE
A MASON TO DISAPPEAR IN THAT FETID MINE THE LADDER OF THE CESS POOL
CLEANER HESITATED TO PLUNGE INTO IT IT WAS SAID IN PROVERBIAL FORM
TO DESCEND INTO THE SEWER IS TO ENTER THE GRAVE AND ALL SORTS OF
HIDEOUS LEGENDS AS WE HAVE SAID COVERED THIS COLOSSAL SINK WITH
TERROR A DREAD SINK HOLE WHICH BEARS THE TRACES OF THE REVOLUTIONS
OF THE GLOBE AS OF THE REVOLUTIONS OF MAN AND WHERE ARE TO BE FOUND
VESTIGES OF ALL CATACLYSMS FROM THE SHELLS OF THE DELUGE TO THE RAG OF
MARAT
BOOK THIRD MUD BUT THE SOUL
CHAPTER I THE SEWER AND ITS SURPRISES
IT WAS IN THE SEWERS OF PARIS THAT JEAN VALJEAN FOUND HIMSELF
STILL ANOTHER RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN PARIS AND THE SEA
AS IN THE OCEAN
THE DIVER MAY DISAPPEAR THERE
THE TRANSITION WAS AN UNHEARD OF ONE
IN THE VERY HEART OF THE CITY
JEAN VALJEAN HAD ESCAPED FROM THE CITY AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
IN THE TIME REQUIRED TO LIFT THE COVER AND TO REPLACE IT HE HAD PASSED
FROM BROAD DAYLIGHT TO COMPLETE OBSCURITY FROM MIDDAY TO MIDNIGHT FROM
TUMULT TO SILENCE FROM THE WHIRLWIND OF THUNDERS TO THE STAGNATION OF
THE TOMB AND BY A VICISSITUDE FAR MORE TREMENDOUS EVEN THAN THAT OF
THE RUE POLONCEAU FROM THE MOST EXTREME PERIL TO THE MOST ABSOLUTE
OBSCURITY
AN ABRUPT FALL INTO A CAVERN A DISAPPEARANCE INTO THE SECRET TRAP DOOR
OF PARIS TO QUIT THAT STREET WHERE DEATH WAS ON EVERY SIDE FOR THAT
SORT OF SEPULCHRE WHERE THERE WAS LIFE WAS A STRANGE INSTANT
HE
REMAINED FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AS THOUGH BEWILDERED LISTENING STUPEFIED
THE WASTE TRAP OF SAFETY HAD SUDDENLY YAWNED BENEATH HIM
CELESTIAL
GOODNESS HAD IN A MANNER CAPTURED HIM BY TREACHERY
ADORABLE
AMBUSCADES OF PROVIDENCE
ONLY THE WOUNDED MAN DID NOT STIR AND JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT KNOW
WHETHER THAT WHICH HE WAS CARRYING IN THAT GRAVE WAS A LIVING BEING OR A
DEAD CORPSE
HIS FIRST SENSATION WAS ONE OF BLINDNESS
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE COULD SEE
NOTHING
IT SEEMED TO HIM TOO THAT IN ONE INSTANT HE HAD BECOME DEAF
HE NO LONGER HEARD ANYTHING
THE FRANTIC STORM OF MURDER WHICH HAD BEEN
LET LOOSE A FEW FEET ABOVE HIS HEAD DID NOT REACH HIM THANKS TO THE
THICKNESS OF THE EARTH WHICH SEPARATED HIM FROM IT AS WE HAVE SAID
OTHERWISE THAN FAINTLY AND INDISTINCTLY AND LIKE A RUMBLING IN THE
DEPTHS
HE FELT THAT THE GROUND WAS SOLID UNDER HIS FEET THAT WAS ALL
BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
HE EXTENDED ONE ARM AND THEN THE OTHER TOUCHED
THE WALLS ON BOTH SIDES AND PERCEIVED THAT THE PASSAGE WAS NARROW HE
SLIPPED AND THUS PERCEIVED THAT THE PAVEMENT WAS WET
HE CAUTIOUSLY PUT
FORWARD ONE FOOT FEARING A HOLE A SINK SOME GULF HE DISCOVERED THAT
THE PAVING CONTINUED
A GUST OF FETIDNESS INFORMED HIM OF THE PLACE IN
WHICH HE STOOD
AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW MINUTES HE WAS NO LONGER BLIND
A LITTLE LIGHT
FELL THROUGH THE MAN HOLE THROUGH WHICH HE HAD DESCENDED AND HIS EYES
BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THIS CAVERN
HE BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH SOMETHING
THE
PASSAGE IN WHICH HE HAD BURROWED NO OTHER WORD CAN BETTER EXPRESS THE
SITUATION WAS WALLED IN BEHIND HIM
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE BLIND ALLEYS
WHICH THE SPECIAL JARGON TERMS BRANCHES
IN FRONT OF HIM THERE WAS
ANOTHER WALL A WALL LIKE NIGHT
THE LIGHT OF THE AIR HOLE DIED OUT TEN
OR TWELVE PACES FROM THE POINT WHERE JEAN VALJEAN STOOD AND BARELY CAST
A WAN PALLOR ON A FEW METRES OF THE DAMP WALLS OF THE SEWER
BEYOND
THE OPAQUENESS WAS MASSIVE TO PENETRATE THITHER SEEMED HORRIBLE AN
ENTRANCE INTO IT APPEARED LIKE AN ENGULFMENT
A MAN COULD HOWEVER
PLUNGE INTO THAT WALL OF FOG AND IT WAS NECESSARY SO TO DO
HASTE WAS
EVEN REQUISITE
IT OCCURRED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THE GRATING WHICH HE
HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF UNDER THE FLAG STONES MIGHT ALSO CATCH THE EYE OF
THE SOLDIERY AND THAT EVERYTHING HUNG UPON THIS CHANCE
THEY ALSO MIGHT
DESCEND INTO THAT WELL AND SEARCH IT
THERE WAS NOT A MINUTE TO BE LOST
HE HAD DEPOSITED MARIUS ON THE GROUND HE PICKED HIM UP AGAIN THAT IS
THE REAL WORD FOR IT PLACED HIM ON HIS SHOULDERS ONCE MORE AND SET
OUT
HE PLUNGED RESOLUTELY INTO THE GLOOM
THE TRUTH IS THAT THEY WERE LESS SAFE THAN JEAN VALJEAN FANCIED
PERILS
OF ANOTHER SORT AND NO LESS SERIOUS WERE AWAITING THEM PERCHANCE
AFTER
THE LIGHTNING CHARGED WHIRLWIND OF THE COMBAT THE CAVERN OF MIASMAS AND
TRAPS AFTER CHAOS THE SEWER
JEAN VALJEAN HAD FALLEN FROM ONE CIRCLE
OF HELL INTO ANOTHER
WHEN HE HAD ADVANCED FIFTY PACES HE WAS OBLIGED TO HALT
A PROBLEM
PRESENTED ITSELF
THE PASSAGE TERMINATED IN ANOTHER GUT WHICH HE
ENCOUNTERED ACROSS HIS PATH
THERE TWO WAYS PRESENTED THEMSELVES
WHICH
SHOULD HE TAKE OUGHT HE TO TURN TO THE LEFT OR TO THE RIGHT HOW WAS HE
TO FIND HIS BEARINGS IN THAT BLACK LABYRINTH THIS LABYRINTH TO WHICH
WE HAVE ALREADY CALLED THE READER'S ATTENTION HAS A CLUE WHICH IS ITS
SLOPE
TO FOLLOW TO THE SLOPE IS TO ARRIVE AT THE RIVER
THIS JEAN VALJEAN INSTANTLY COMPREHENDED
HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS PROBABLY IN THE SEWER DES HALLES THAT
IF HE WERE TO CHOOSE THE PATH TO THE LEFT AND FOLLOW THE SLOPE HE WOULD
ARRIVE IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT SOME MOUTH ON THE SEINE
BETWEEN THE PONT AU CHANGE AND THE PONT NEUF THAT IS TO SAY HE WOULD
MAKE HIS APPEARANCE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ON THE MOST DENSELY PEOPLED SPOT
IN PARIS
PERHAPS HE WOULD COME OUT ON SOME MAN HOLE AT THE INTERSECTION
OF STREETS
AMAZEMENT OF THE PASSERS BY AT BEHOLDING TWO BLEEDING MEN
EMERGE FROM THE EARTH AT THEIR FEET
ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE A CALL TO
ARMS OF THE NEIGHBORING POST OF GUARDS
THUS THEY WOULD BE SEIZED BEFORE
THEY HAD EVEN GOT OUT
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO PLUNGE INTO THAT LABYRINTH
TO CONFIDE THEMSELVES TO THAT BLACK GLOOM AND TO TRUST TO PROVIDENCE
FOR THE OUTCOME
HE ASCENDED THE INCLINE AND TURNED TO THE RIGHT
WHEN HE HAD TURNED THE ANGLE OF THE GALLERY THE DISTANT GLIMMER OF AN
AIR HOLE DISAPPEARED THE CURTAIN OF OBSCURITY FELL UPON HIM ONCE MORE
AND HE BECAME BLIND AGAIN
NEVERTHELESS HE ADVANCED AS RAPIDLY AS
POSSIBLE
MARIUS' TWO ARMS WERE PASSED ROUND HIS NECK AND THE FORMER'S
FEET DRAGGED BEHIND HIM
HE HELD BOTH THESE ARMS WITH ONE HAND AND
GROPED ALONG THE WALL WITH THE OTHER
MARIUS' CHEEK TOUCHED HIS AND
CLUNG THERE BLEEDING
HE FELT A WARM STREAM WHICH CAME FROM MARIUS
TRICKLING DOWN UPON HIM AND MAKING ITS WAY UNDER HIS CLOTHES
BUT A
HUMID WARMTH NEAR HIS EAR WHICH THE MOUTH OF THE WOUNDED MAN TOUCHED
INDICATED RESPIRATION AND CONSEQUENTLY LIFE
THE PASSAGE ALONG WHICH
JEAN VALJEAN WAS NOW PROCEEDING WAS NOT SO NARROW AS THE FIRST
JEAN
VALJEAN WALKED THROUGH IT WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY
THE RAIN OF THE
PRECEDING DAY HAD NOT AS YET ENTIRELY RUN OFF AND IT CREATED A LITTLE
TORRENT IN THE CENTRE OF THE BOTTOM AND HE WAS FORCED TO HUG THE WALL
IN ORDER NOT TO HAVE HIS FEET IN THE WATER
THUS HE PROCEEDED IN THE GLOOM
HE RESEMBLED THE BEINGS OF THE NIGHT
GROPING IN THE INVISIBLE AND LOST BENEATH THE EARTH IN VEINS OF SHADOW
STILL LITTLE BY LITTLE WHETHER IT WAS THAT THE DISTANT AIR HOLES
EMITTED A LITTLE WAVERING LIGHT IN THIS OPAQUE GLOOM OR WHETHER HIS
EYES HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE OBSCURITY SOME VAGUE VISION RETURNED
TO HIM AND HE BEGAN ONCE MORE TO GAIN A CONFUSED IDEA NOW OF THE WALL
WHICH HE TOUCHED NOW OF THE VAULT BENEATH WHICH HE WAS PASSING
THE
PUPIL DILATES IN THE DARK AND THE SOUL DILATES IN MISFORTUNE AND ENDS
BY FINDING GOD THERE
IT WAS NOT EASY TO DIRECT HIS COURSE
THE LINE OF THE SEWER RE ECHOES SO TO SPEAK THE LINE OF THE STREETS
WHICH LIE ABOVE IT
THERE WERE THEN IN PARIS TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED
STREETS
LET THE READER IMAGINE HIMSELF BENEATH THAT FOREST OF GLOOMY
BRANCHES WHICH IS CALLED THE SEWER
THE SYSTEM OF SEWERS EXISTING AT
THAT EPOCH PLACED END TO END WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LENGTH OF ELEVEN
LEAGUES
WE HAVE SAID ABOVE THAT THE ACTUAL NET WORK THANKS TO THE
SPECIAL ACTIVITY OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WAS NO LESS THAN SIXTY
LEAGUES IN EXTENT
JEAN VALJEAN BEGAN BY COMMITTING A BLUNDER
HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS
BENEATH THE RUE SAINT DENIS AND IT WAS A PITY THAT IT WAS NOT SO
UNDER
THE RUE SAINT DENIS THERE IS AN OLD STONE SEWER WHICH DATES FROM LOUIS
XIII
AND WHICH RUNS STRAIGHT TO THE COLLECTING SEWER CALLED THE GRAND
SEWER WITH BUT A SINGLE ELBOW ON THE RIGHT ON THE ELEVATION OF THE
ANCIENT COUR DES MIRACLES AND A SINGLE BRANCH THE SAINT MARTIN SEWER
WHOSE FOUR ARMS DESCRIBE A CROSS
BUT THE GUT OF THE PETITE TRUANDERIE
THE ENTRANCE TO WHICH WAS IN THE VICINITY OF THE CORINTHE WINE SHOP HAS
NEVER COMMUNICATED WITH THE SEWER OF THE RUE SAINT DENIS IT ENDED
AT THE MONTMARTRE SEWER AND IT WAS IN THIS THAT JEAN VALJEAN WAS
ENTANGLED
THERE OPPORTUNITIES OF LOSING ONESELF ABOUND
THE MONTMARTRE
SEWER IS ONE OF THE MOST LABYRINTHINE OF THE ANCIENT NETWORK
FORTUNATELY JEAN VALJEAN HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM THE SEWER OF THE MARKETS
WHOSE GEOMETRICAL PLAN PRESENTS THE APPEARANCE OF A MULTITUDE OF
PARROTS' ROOSTS PILED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER BUT HE HAD BEFORE HIM MORE
THAN ONE EMBARRASSING ENCOUNTER AND MORE THAN ONE STREET CORNER FOR
THEY ARE STREETS PRESENTING ITSELF IN THE GLOOM LIKE AN INTERROGATION
POINT FIRST ON HIS LEFT THE VAST SEWER OF THE PLATRIERE A SORT OF
CHINESE PUZZLE THRUSTING OUT AND ENTANGLING ITS CHAOS OF TS AND ZS
UNDER THE POST OFFICE AND UNDER THE ROTUNDA OF THE WHEAT MARKET AS FAR
AS THE SEINE WHERE IT TERMINATES IN A Y SECONDLY ON HIS RIGHT THE
CURVING CORRIDOR OF THE RUE DU CADRAN WITH ITS THREE TEETH WHICH
ARE ALSO BLIND COURTS THIRDLY ON HIS LEFT THE BRANCH OF THE
MAIL COMPLICATED ALMOST AT ITS INCEPTION WITH A SORT OF FORK AND
PROCEEDING FROM ZIG ZAG TO ZIG ZAG UNTIL IT ENDS IN THE GRAND CRYPT OF
THE OUTLET OF THE LOUVRE TRUNCATED AND RAMIFIED IN EVERY DIRECTION AND
LASTLY THE BLIND ALLEY OF A PASSAGE OF THE RUE DES JEUNEURS WITHOUT
COUNTING LITTLE DUCTS HERE AND THERE BEFORE REACHING THE BELT SEWER
WHICH ALONE COULD CONDUCT HIM TO SOME ISSUE SUFFICIENTLY DISTANT TO BE
SAFE
HAD JEAN VALJEAN HAD ANY IDEA OF ALL THAT WE HAVE HERE POINTED OUT HE
WOULD SPEEDILY HAVE PERCEIVED MERELY BY FEELING THE WALL THAT HE WAS
NOT IN THE SUBTERRANEAN GALLERY OF THE RUE SAINT DENIS
INSTEAD OF THE
ANCIENT STONE INSTEAD OF THE ANTIQUE ARCHITECTURE HAUGHTY AND ROYAL
EVEN IN THE SEWER WITH PAVEMENT AND STRING COURSES OF GRANITE AND
MORTAR COSTING EIGHT HUNDRED LIVRES THE FATHOM HE WOULD HAVE FELT UNDER
HIS HAND CONTEMPORARY CHEAPNESS ECONOMICAL EXPEDIENTS POROUS STONE
FILLED WITH MORTAR ON A CONCRETE FOUNDATION WHICH COSTS TWO HUNDRED
FRANCS THE METRE AND THE BOURGEOISE MASONRY KNOWN AS A PETITS
MATERIAUX SMALL STUFF BUT OF ALL THIS HE KNEW NOTHING
HE ADVANCED WITH ANXIETY BUT WITH CALMNESS SEEING NOTHING KNOWING
NOTHING BURIED IN CHANCE THAT IS TO SAY ENGULFED IN PROVIDENCE
BY DEGREES WE WILL ADMIT A CERTAIN HORROR SEIZED UPON HIM
THE GLOOM
WHICH ENVELOPED HIM PENETRATED HIS SPIRIT
HE WALKED IN AN ENIGMA
THIS
AQUEDUCT OF THE SEWER IS FORMIDABLE IT INTERLACES IN A DIZZY FASHION
IT IS A MELANCHOLY THING TO BE CAUGHT IN THIS PARIS OF SHADOWS
JEAN
VALJEAN WAS OBLIGED TO FIND AND EVEN TO INVENT HIS ROUTE WITHOUT SEEING
IT
IN THIS UNKNOWN EVERY STEP THAT HE RISKED MIGHT BE HIS LAST
HOW
WAS HE TO GET OUT SHOULD HE FIND AN ISSUE SHOULD HE FIND IT IN TIME
WOULD THAT COLOSSAL SUBTERRANEAN SPONGE WITH ITS STONE CAVITIES ALLOW
ITSELF TO BE PENETRATED AND PIERCED SHOULD HE THERE ENCOUNTER SOME
UNEXPECTED KNOT IN THE DARKNESS SHOULD HE ARRIVE AT THE INEXTRICABLE
AND THE IMPASSABLE WOULD MARIUS DIE THERE OF HEMORRHAGE AND HE OF
HUNGER SHOULD THEY END BY BOTH GETTING LOST AND BY FURNISHING TWO
SKELETONS IN A NOOK OF THAT NIGHT HE DID NOT KNOW
HE PUT ALL THESE
QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF WITHOUT REPLYING TO THEM
THE INTESTINES OF PARIS
FORM A PRECIPICE
LIKE THE PROPHET HE WAS IN THE BELLY OF THE MONSTER
ALL AT ONCE HE HAD A SURPRISE
AT THE MOST UNFORESEEN MOMENT AND
WITHOUT HAVING CEASED TO WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE HE PERCEIVED THAT HE
WAS NO LONGER ASCENDING THE WATER OF THE RIVULET WAS BEATING AGAINST
HIS HEELS INSTEAD OF MEETING HIM AT HIS TOES
THE SEWER WAS NOW
DESCENDING
WHY WAS HE ABOUT TO ARRIVE SUDDENLY AT THE SEINE THIS
DANGER WAS A GREAT ONE BUT THE PERIL OF RETREATING WAS STILL GREATER
HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE
IT WAS NOT TOWARDS THE SEINE THAT HE WAS PROCEEDING
THE RIDGE WHICH
THE SOIL OF PARIS FORMS ON ITS RIGHT BANK EMPTIES ONE OF ITS WATER SHEDS
INTO THE SEINE AND THE OTHER INTO THE GRAND SEWER
THE CREST OF THIS
RIDGE WHICH DETERMINES THE DIVISION OF THE WATERS DESCRIBES A VERY
CAPRICIOUS LINE
THE CULMINATING POINT WHICH IS THE POINT OF
SEPARATION OF THE CURRENTS IS IN THE SAINTE AVOYE SEWER BEYOND THE RUE
MICHELLE COMTE IN THE SEWER OF THE LOUVRE NEAR THE BOULEVARDS AND
IN THE MONTMARTRE SEWER NEAR THE HALLES
IT WAS THIS CULMINATING POINT
THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD REACHED
HE WAS DIRECTING HIS COURSE TOWARDS THE
BELT SEWER HE WAS ON THE RIGHT PATH
BUT HE DID NOT KNOW IT
EVERY TIME THAT HE ENCOUNTERED A BRANCH HE FELT OF ITS ANGLES AND IF
HE FOUND THAT THE OPENING WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF WAS SMALLER THAN THE
PASSAGE IN WHICH HE WAS HE DID NOT ENTER BUT CONTINUED HIS ROUTE
RIGHTLY JUDGING THAT EVERY NARROWER WAY MUST NEEDS TERMINATE IN A BLIND
ALLEY AND COULD ONLY LEAD HIM FURTHER FROM HIS GOAL THAT IS TO SAY
THE OUTLET
THUS HE AVOIDED THE QUADRUPLE TRAP WHICH WAS SET FOR HIM IN
THE DARKNESS BY THE FOUR LABYRINTHS WHICH WE HAVE JUST ENUMERATED
AT A CERTAIN MOMENT HE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS EMERGING FROM BENEATH
THE PARIS WHICH WAS PETRIFIED BY THE UPRISING WHERE THE BARRICADES HAD
SUPPRESSED CIRCULATION AND THAT HE WAS ENTERING BENEATH THE LIVING AND
NORMAL PARIS
OVERHEAD HE SUDDENLY HEARD A NOISE AS OF THUNDER DISTANT
BUT CONTINUOUS
IT WAS THE RUMBLING OF VEHICLES
HE HAD BEEN WALKING FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE
CALCULATION WHICH HE MADE IN HIS OWN MIND AND HE HAD NOT YET THOUGHT OF
REST HE HAD MERELY CHANGED THE HAND WITH WHICH HE WAS HOLDING MARIUS
THE DARKNESS WAS MORE PROFOUND THAN EVER BUT ITS VERY DEPTH REASSURED
HIM
ALL AT ONCE HE SAW HIS SHADOW IN FRONT OF HIM
IT WAS OUTLINED ON
A FAINT ALMOST INDISTINCT REDDISH GLOW WHICH VAGUELY EMPURPLED THE
FLOORING VAULT UNDERFOOT AND THE VAULT OVERHEAD AND GILDED TO HIS
RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT THE TWO VISCOUS WALLS OF THE PASSAGE
STUPEFIED
HE TURNED ROUND
BEHIND HIM IN THE PORTION OF THE PASSAGE WHICH HE HAD JUST PASSED
THROUGH AT A DISTANCE WHICH APPEARED TO HIM IMMENSE PIERCING THE DENSE
OBSCURITY FLAMED A SORT OF HORRIBLE STAR WHICH HAD THE AIR OF SURVEYING
HIM
IT WAS THE GLOOMY STAR OF THE POLICE WHICH WAS RISING IN THE SEWER
IN THE REAR OF THAT STAR EIGHT OR TEN FORMS WERE MOVING ABOUT IN A
CONFUSED WAY BLACK UPRIGHT INDISTINCT HORRIBLE
CHAPTER II EXPLANATION
ON THE DAY OF THE SIXTH OF JUNE A BATTUE OF THE SEWERS HAD BEEN
ORDERED
IT WAS FEARED THAT THE VANQUISHED MIGHT HAVE TAKEN TO THEM FOR
REFUGE AND PREFECT GISQUET WAS TO SEARCH OCCULT PARIS WHILE GENERAL
BUGEAUD SWEPT PUBLIC PARIS A DOUBLE AND CONNECTED OPERATION WHICH
EXACTED A DOUBLE STRATEGY ON THE PART OF THE PUBLIC FORCE REPRESENTED
ABOVE BY THE ARMY AND BELOW BY THE POLICE
THREE SQUADS OF AGENTS AND
SEWERMEN EXPLORED THE SUBTERRANEAN DRAIN OF PARIS THE FIRST ON THE
RIGHT BANK THE SECOND ON THE LEFT BANK THE THIRD IN THE CITY
THE
AGENTS OF POLICE WERE ARMED WITH CARABINES WITH BLUDGEONS SWORDS AND
POIGNARDS
THAT WHICH WAS DIRECTED AT JEAN VALJEAN AT THAT MOMENT WAS THE LANTERN
OF THE PATROL OF THE RIGHT BANK
THIS PATROL HAD JUST VISITED THE CURVING GALLERY AND THE THREE BLIND
ALLEYS WHICH LIE BENEATH THE RUE DU CADRAN
WHILE THEY WERE PASSING
THEIR LANTERN THROUGH THE DEPTHS OF THESE BLIND ALLEYS JEAN VALJEAN HAD
ENCOUNTERED ON HIS PATH THE ENTRANCE TO THE GALLERY HAD PERCEIVED
THAT IT WAS NARROWER THAN THE PRINCIPAL PASSAGE AND HAD NOT PENETRATED
THITHER
HE HAD PASSED ON
THE POLICE ON EMERGING FROM THE GALLERY
DU CADRAN HAD FANCIED THAT THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE BELT SEWER
THEY WERE IN FACT THE STEPS OF JEAN
VALJEAN
THE SERGEANT IN COMMAND OF THE PATROL HAD RAISED HIS LANTERN
AND THE SQUAD HAD BEGUN TO GAZE INTO THE MIST IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE
THE SOUND PROCEEDED
THIS WAS AN INDESCRIBABLE MOMENT FOR JEAN VALJEAN
HAPPILY IF HE SAW THE LANTERN WELL THE LANTERN SAW HIM BUT ILL
IT
WAS LIGHT AND HE WAS SHADOW
HE WAS VERY FAR OFF AND MINGLED WITH THE
DARKNESS OF THE PLACE
HE HUGGED THE WALL AND HALTED
MOREOVER HE DID
NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS THAT WAS MOVING BEHIND HIM
THE LACK OF SLEEP
AND FOOD AND HIS EMOTIONS HAD CAUSED HIM ALSO TO PASS INTO THE STATE OF
A VISIONARY
HE BEHELD A GLEAM AND AROUND THAT GLEAM FORMS
WHAT WAS
IT HE DID NOT COMPREHEND
JEAN VALJEAN HAVING PAUSED THE SOUND CEASED
THE MEN OF THE PATROL LISTENED AND HEARD NOTHING THEY LOOKED AND SAW
NOTHING
THEY HELD A CONSULTATION
THERE EXISTED AT THAT EPOCH AT THIS POINT OF THE MONTMARTRE SEWER A SORT
OF CROSS ROADS CALLED DE SERVICE WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS SUPPRESSED ON
ACCOUNT OF THE LITTLE INTERIOR LAKE WHICH FORMED THERE SWALLOWING UP
THE TORRENT OF RAIN IN HEAVY STORMS
THE PATROL COULD FORM A CLUSTER IN
THIS OPEN SPACE
JEAN VALJEAN SAW THESE SPECTRES FORM A SORT OF CIRCLE
THESE BULL DOGS' HEADS APPROACHED EACH OTHER CLOSELY AND WHISPERED
TOGETHER
THE RESULT OF THIS COUNCIL HELD BY THE WATCH DOGS WAS THAT THEY HAD
BEEN MISTAKEN THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO NOISE THAT IT WAS USELESS TO GET
ENTANGLED IN THE BELT SEWER THAT IT WOULD ONLY BE A WASTE OF TIME
BUT THAT THEY OUGHT TO HASTEN TOWARDS SAINT MERRY THAT IF THERE
WAS ANYTHING TO DO AND ANY BOUSINGOT TO TRACK OUT IT WAS IN THAT
QUARTER
FROM TIME TO TIME PARTIES RE SOLE THEIR OLD INSULTS
IN 1832 THE WORD
BOUSINGOT FORMED THE INTERIM BETWEEN THE WORD JACOBIN WHICH HAD BECOME
OBSOLETE AND THE WORD DEMAGOGUE WHICH HAS SINCE RENDERED SUCH EXCELLENT
SERVICE
THE SERGEANT GAVE ORDERS TO TURN TO THE LEFT TOWARDS THE WATERSHED OF
THE SEINE
IF IT HAD OCCURRED TO THEM TO SEPARATE INTO TWO SQUADS AND TO GO IN
BOTH DIRECTIONS JEAN VALJEAN WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPTURED
ALL HUNG ON
THAT THREAD
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE PREFECTURE
FORESEEING A POSSIBILITY OF COMBAT AND INSURGENTS IN FORCE HAD
FORBIDDEN THE PATROL TO PART COMPANY
THE PATROL RESUMED ITS MARCH
LEAVING JEAN VALJEAN BEHIND IT
OF ALL THIS MOVEMENT JEAN VALJEAN
PERCEIVED NOTHING EXCEPT THE ECLIPSE OF THE LANTERN WHICH SUDDENLY
WHEELED ROUND
BEFORE TAKING HIS DEPARTURE THE SERGEANT IN ORDER TO ACQUIT HIS
POLICEMAN'S CONSCIENCE DISCHARGED HIS GUN IN THE DIRECTION OF JEAN
VALJEAN
THE DETONATION ROLLED FROM ECHO TO ECHO IN THE CRYPT LIKE THE
RUMBLING OF THAT TITANIC ENTRAIL
A BIT OF PLASTER WHICH FELL INTO THE
STREAM AND SPLASHED UP THE WATER A FEW PACES AWAY FROM JEAN VALJEAN
WARNED HIM THAT THE BALL HAD STRUCK THE ARCH OVER HIS HEAD
SLOW AND MEASURED STEPS RESOUNDED FOR SOME TIME ON THE TIMBER WORK
GRADUALLY DYING AWAY AS THEY RETREATED TO A GREATER DISTANCE THE GROUP
OF BLACK FORMS VANISHED A GLIMMER OF LIGHT OSCILLATED AND FLOATED
COMMUNICATING TO THE VAULT A REDDISH GLOW WHICH GREW FAINTER THEN
DISAPPEARED THE SILENCE BECAME PROFOUND ONCE MORE THE OBSCURITY BECAME
COMPLETE BLINDNESS AND DEAFNESS RESUMED POSSESSION OF THE SHADOWS
AND JEAN VALJEAN NOT DARING TO STIR AS YET REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME
LEANING WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL WITH STRAINING EARS AND DILATED
PUPILS WATCHING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THAT PHANTOM PATROL
CHAPTER III THE SPUN MAN
THIS JUSTICE MUST BE RENDERED TO THE POLICE OF THAT PERIOD THAT EVEN IN
THE MOST SERIOUS PUBLIC JUNCTURES IT IMPERTURBABLY FULFILLED ITS DUTIES
CONNECTED WITH THE SEWERS AND SURVEILLANCE
A REVOLT WAS IN ITS EYES
NO PRETEXT FOR ALLOWING MALEFACTORS TO TAKE THE BIT IN THEIR OWN MOUTHS
AND FOR NEGLECTING SOCIETY FOR THE REASON THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS IN
PERIL
THE ORDINARY SERVICE WAS PERFORMED CORRECTLY IN COMPANY WITH THE
EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE AND WAS NOT TROUBLED BY THE LATTER
IN THE MIDST
OF AN INCALCULABLE POLITICAL EVENT ALREADY BEGUN UNDER THE PRESSURE OF
A POSSIBLE REVOLUTION A POLICE AGENT SPUN A THIEF WITHOUT ALLOWING
HIMSELF TO BE DISTRACTED BY INSURRECTION AND BARRICADES
IT WAS SOMETHING PRECISELY PARALLEL WHICH TOOK PLACE ON THE AFTERNOON
OF THE 6TH OF JUNE ON THE BANKS OF THE SEINE ON THE SLOPE OF THE RIGHT
SHORE A LITTLE BEYOND THE PONT DES INVALIDES
THERE IS NO LONGER ANY BANK THERE NOW
THE ASPECT OF THE LOCALITY HAS
CHANGED
ON THAT BANK TWO MEN SEPARATED BY A CERTAIN DISTANCE SEEMED TO BE
WATCHING EACH OTHER WHILE MUTUALLY AVOIDING EACH OTHER
THE ONE WHO WAS
IN ADVANCE WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY THE ONE IN THE REAR WAS TRYING TO
OVERTAKE THE OTHER
IT WAS LIKE A GAME OF CHECKERS PLAYED AT A DISTANCE AND IN SILENCE
NEITHER SEEMED TO BE IN ANY HURRY AND BOTH WALKED SLOWLY AS THOUGH
EACH OF THEM FEARED BY TOO MUCH HASTE TO MAKE HIS PARTNER REDOUBLE HIS
PACE
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS AN APPETITE FOLLOWING ITS PREY AND
PURPOSELY WITHOUT WEARING THE AIR OF DOING SO
THE PREY WAS CRAFTY AND
ON ITS GUARD
THE PROPER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HUNTED POLE CAT AND THE HUNTING DOG
WERE OBSERVED
THE ONE WHO WAS SEEKING TO ESCAPE HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT
MIEN AND NOT AN IMPRESSIVE APPEARANCE THE ONE WHO WAS SEEKING TO SEIZE
HIM WAS RUDE OF ASPECT AND MUST HAVE BEEN RUDE TO ENCOUNTER
THE FIRST CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS THE MORE FEEBLE AVOIDED THE SECOND
BUT HE AVOIDED HIM IN A MANNER WHICH WAS DEEPLY FURIOUS ANY ONE WHO
COULD HAVE OBSERVED HIM WOULD HAVE DISCERNED IN HIS EYES THE SOMBRE
HOSTILITY OF FLIGHT AND ALL THE MENACE THAT FEAR CONTAINS
THE SHORE WAS DESERTED THERE WERE NO PASSERS BY NOT EVEN A BOATMAN NOR
A LIGHTER MAN WAS IN THE SKIFFS WHICH WERE MOORED HERE AND THERE
IT WAS NOT EASY TO SEE THESE TWO MEN EXCEPT FROM THE QUAY OPPOSITE AND
TO ANY PERSON WHO HAD SCRUTINIZED THEM AT THAT DISTANCE THE MAN WHO WAS
IN ADVANCE WOULD HAVE APPEARED LIKE A BRISTLING TATTERED AND EQUIVOCAL
BEING WHO WAS UNEASY AND TREMBLING BENEATH A RAGGED BLOUSE AND THE
OTHER LIKE A CLASSIC AND OFFICIAL PERSONAGE WEARING THE FROCK COAT OF
AUTHORITY BUTTONED TO THE CHIN
PERCHANCE THE READER MIGHT RECOGNIZE THESE TWO MEN IF HE WERE TO SEE
THEM CLOSER AT HAND
WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF THE SECOND MAN
PROBABLY TO SUCCEED IN CLOTHING THE FIRST MORE WARMLY
WHEN A MAN CLOTHED BY THE STATE PURSUES A MAN IN RAGS IT IS IN ORDER
TO MAKE OF HIM A MAN WHO IS ALSO CLOTHED BY THE STATE
ONLY THE WHOLE
QUESTION LIES IN THE COLOR
TO BE DRESSED IN BLUE IS GLORIOUS TO BE
DRESSED IN RED IS DISAGREEABLE
THERE IS A PURPLE FROM BELOW
IT IS PROBABLY SOME UNPLEASANTNESS AND SOME PURPLE OF THIS SORT WHICH
THE FIRST MAN IS DESIROUS OF SHIRKING
IF THE OTHER ALLOWED HIM TO WALK ON AND HAD NOT SEIZED HIM AS YET IT
WAS JUDGING FROM ALL APPEARANCES IN THE HOPE OF SEEING HIM LEAD UP TO
SOME SIGNIFICANT MEETING PLACE AND TO SOME GROUP WORTH CATCHING
THIS
DELICATE OPERATION IS CALLED SPINNING
WHAT RENDERS THIS CONJECTURE ENTIRELY PROBABLE IS THAT THE BUTTONED UP
MAN ON CATCHING SIGHT FROM THE SHORE OF A HACKNEY COACH ON THE QUAY
AS IT WAS PASSING ALONG EMPTY MADE A SIGN TO THE DRIVER THE DRIVER
UNDERSTOOD EVIDENTLY RECOGNIZED THE PERSON WITH WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL
TURNED ABOUT AND BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE TWO MEN AT THE TOP OF THE QUAY
AT A FOOT PACE
THIS WAS NOT OBSERVED BY THE SLOUCHING AND TATTERED
PERSONAGE WHO WAS IN ADVANCE
THE HACKNEY COACH ROLLED ALONG THE TREES OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES
THE
BUST OF THE DRIVER WHIP IN HAND COULD BE SEEN MOVING ALONG ABOVE THE
PARAPET
ONE OF THE SECRET INSTRUCTIONS OF THE POLICE AUTHORITIES TO THEIR AGENTS
CONTAINS THIS ARTICLE ALWAYS HAVE ON HAND A HACKNEY COACH IN CASE OF
EMERGENCY
WHILE THESE TWO MEN WERE MANOEUVRING EACH ON HIS OWN SIDE WITH
IRREPROACHABLE STRATEGY THEY APPROACHED AN INCLINED PLANE ON THE QUAY
WHICH DESCENDED TO THE SHORE AND WHICH PERMITTED CAB DRIVERS ARRIVING
FROM PASSY TO COME TO THE RIVER AND WATER THEIR HORSES
THIS INCLINED
PLANE WAS SUPPRESSED LATER ON FOR THE SAKE OF SYMMETRY HORSES MAY DIE
OF THIRST BUT THE EYE IS GRATIFIED
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE MAN IN THE BLOUSE HAD INTENDED TO ASCEND
THIS INCLINED PLANE WITH A VIEW TO MAKING HIS ESCAPE INTO THE
CHAMPS ELYSEES A PLACE ORNAMENTED WITH TREES BUT IN RETURN MUCH
INFESTED WITH POLICEMEN AND WHERE THE OTHER COULD EASILY EXERCISE
VIOLENCE
THIS POINT ON THE QUAY IS NOT VERY FAR DISTANT FROM THE HOUSE BROUGHT TO
PARIS FROM MORET IN 1824 BY COLONEL BRACK AND DESIGNATED AS THE HOUSE
OF FRANCOIS I A GUARD HOUSE IS SITUATED CLOSE AT HAND
TO THE GREAT SURPRISE OF HIS WATCHER THE MAN WHO WAS BEING TRACKED DID
NOT MOUNT BY THE INCLINED PLANE FOR WATERING
HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE
ALONG THE QUAY ON THE SHORE
HIS POSITION WAS VISIBLY BECOMING CRITICAL
WHAT WAS HE INTENDING TO DO IF NOT TO THROW HIMSELF INTO THE SEINE
HENCEFORTH THERE EXISTED NO MEANS OF ASCENDING TO THE QUAY THERE WAS
NO OTHER INCLINED PLANE NO STAIRCASE AND THEY WERE NEAR THE SPOT
MARKED BY THE BEND IN THE SEINE TOWARDS THE PONT DE JENA WHERE THE
BANK GROWING CONSTANTLY NARROWER ENDED IN A SLENDER TONGUE AND
WAS LOST IN THE WATER
THERE HE WOULD INEVITABLY FIND HIMSELF BLOCKED
BETWEEN THE PERPENDICULAR WALL ON HIS RIGHT THE RIVER ON HIS LEFT AND
IN FRONT OF HIM AND THE AUTHORITIES ON HIS HEELS
IT IS TRUE THAT THIS TERMINATION OF THE SHORE WAS HIDDEN FROM SIGHT BY A
HEAP OF RUBBISH SIX OR SEVEN FEET IN HEIGHT PRODUCED BY SOME DEMOLITION
OR OTHER
BUT DID THIS MAN HOPE TO CONCEAL HIMSELF EFFECTUALLY BEHIND
THAT HEAP OF RUBBISH WHICH ONE NEED BUT SKIRT THE EXPEDIENT WOULD
HAVE BEEN PUERILE
HE CERTAINLY WAS NOT DREAMING OF SUCH A THING
THE
INNOCENCE OF THIEVES DOES NOT EXTEND TO THAT POINT
THE PILE OF RUBBISH FORMED A SORT OF PROJECTION AT THE WATER'S EDGE
WHICH WAS PROLONGED IN A PROMONTORY AS FAR AS THE WALL OF THE QUAY
THE MAN WHO WAS BEING FOLLOWED ARRIVED AT THIS LITTLE MOUND AND WENT
ROUND IT SO THAT HE CEASED TO BE SEEN BY THE OTHER
THE LATTER AS HE DID NOT SEE COULD NOT BE SEEN HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF
THIS FACT TO ABANDON ALL DISSIMULATION AND TO WALK VERY RAPIDLY
IN A
FEW MOMENTS HE HAD REACHED THE RUBBISH HEAP AND PASSED ROUND IT
THERE
HE HALTED IN SHEER AMAZEMENT
THE MAN WHOM HE HAD BEEN PURSUING WAS NO
LONGER THERE
TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE MAN IN THE BLOUSE
THE SHORE BEGINNING WITH THE RUBBISH HEAP WAS ONLY ABOUT THIRTY PACES
LONG THEN IT PLUNGED INTO THE WATER WHICH BEAT AGAINST THE WALL OF THE
QUAY
THE FUGITIVE COULD NOT HAVE THROWN HIMSELF INTO THE SEINE WITHOUT
BEING SEEN BY THE MAN WHO WAS FOLLOWING HIM
WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM
THE MAN IN THE BUTTONED UP COAT WALKED TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE SHORE
AND REMAINED THERE IN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT HIS FISTS CLENCHED HIS EYES
SEARCHING
ALL AT ONCE HE SMOTE HIS BROW
HE HAD JUST PERCEIVED AT THE
POINT WHERE THE LAND CAME TO AN END AND THE WATER BEGAN A LARGE IRON
GRATING LOW ARCHED GARNISHED WITH A HEAVY LOCK AND WITH THREE MASSIVE
HINGES
THIS GRATING A SORT OF DOOR PIERCED AT THE BASE OF THE QUAY
OPENED ON THE RIVER AS WELL AS ON THE SHORE
A BLACKISH STREAM PASSED
UNDER IT
THIS STREAM DISCHARGED INTO THE SEINE
BEYOND THE HEAVY RUSTY IRON BARS A SORT OF DARK AND VAULTED CORRIDOR
COULD BE DESCRIED
THE MAN FOLDED HIS ARMS AND STARED AT THE GRATING
WITH AN AIR OF REPROACH
AS THIS GAZE DID NOT SUFFICE HE TRIED TO THRUST IT ASIDE HE SHOOK
IT IT RESISTED SOLIDLY
IT IS PROBABLE THAT IT HAD JUST BEEN OPENED
ALTHOUGH NO SOUND HAD BEEN HEARD A SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCE IN SO RUSTY A
GRATING BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT IT HAD BEEN CLOSED AGAIN
THIS INDICATED
THAT THE MAN BEFORE WHOM THAT DOOR HAD JUST OPENED HAD NOT A HOOK BUT A
KEY
THIS EVIDENCE SUDDENLY BURST UPON THE MIND OF THE MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO
MOVE THE GRATING AND EVOKED FROM HIM THIS INDIGNANT EJACULATION
THAT IS TOO MUCH A GOVERNMENT KEY
THEN IMMEDIATELY REGAINING HIS COMPOSURE HE EXPRESSED A WHOLE WORLD
OF INTERIOR IDEAS BY THIS OUTBURST OF MONOSYLLABLES ACCENTED ALMOST
IRONICALLY COME COME COME COME
THAT SAID AND IN THE HOPE OF SOMETHING OR OTHER EITHER THAT HE SHOULD
SEE THE MAN EMERGE OR OTHER MEN ENTER HE POSTED HIMSELF ON THE WATCH
BEHIND A HEAP OF RUBBISH WITH THE PATIENT RAGE OF A POINTER
THE HACKNEY COACH WHICH REGULATED ALL ITS MOVEMENTS ON HIS HAD IN ITS
TURN HALTED ON THE QUAY ABOVE HIM CLOSE TO THE PARAPET
THE COACHMAN
FORESEEING A PROLONGED WAIT ENCASED HIS HORSES' MUZZLES IN THE BAG OF
OATS WHICH IS DAMP AT THE BOTTOM AND WHICH IS SO FAMILIAR TO PARISIANS
TO WHOM BE IT SAID IN PARENTHESIS THE GOVERNMENT SOMETIMES APPLIES IT
THE RARE PASSERS BY ON THE PONT DE JENA TURNED THEIR HEADS BEFORE THEY
PURSUED THEIR WAY TO TAKE A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT THESE TWO MOTIONLESS
ITEMS IN THE LANDSCAPE THE MAN ON THE SHORE THE CARRIAGE ON THE QUAY
CHAPTER IV HE ALSO BEARS HIS CROSS
JEAN VALJEAN HAD RESUMED HIS MARCH AND HAD NOT AGAIN PAUSED
THIS MARCH BECAME MORE AND MORE LABORIOUS
THE LEVEL OF THESE VAULTS
VARIES THE AVERAGE HEIGHT IS ABOUT FIVE FEET SIX INCHES AND HAS BEEN
CALCULATED FOR THE STATURE OF A MAN JEAN VALJEAN WAS FORCED TO BEND
OVER IN ORDER NOT TO STRIKE MARIUS AGAINST THE VAULT AT EVERY STEP
HE HAD TO BEND THEN TO RISE AND TO FEEL INCESSANTLY OF THE WALL
THE
MOISTURE OF THE STONES AND THE VISCOUS NATURE OF THE TIMBER FRAMEWORK
FURNISHED BUT POOR SUPPORTS TO WHICH TO CLING EITHER FOR HAND OR FOOT
HE STUMBLED ALONG IN THE HIDEOUS DUNG HEAP OF THE CITY
THE INTERMITTENT
GLEAMS FROM THE AIR HOLES ONLY APPEARED AT VERY LONG INTERVALS AND WERE
SO WAN THAT THE FULL SUNLIGHT SEEMED LIKE THE LIGHT OF THE MOON ALL
THE REST WAS MIST MIASMA OPAQUENESS BLACKNESS
JEAN VALJEAN WAS BOTH
HUNGRY AND THIRSTY ESPECIALLY THIRSTY AND THIS LIKE THE SEA WAS A
PLACE FULL OF WATER WHERE A MAN CANNOT DRINK
HIS STRENGTH WHICH WAS
PRODIGIOUS AS THE READER KNOWS AND WHICH HAD BEEN BUT LITTLE DECREASED
BY AGE THANKS TO HIS CHASTE AND SOBER LIFE BEGAN TO GIVE WAY
NEVERTHELESS
FATIGUE BEGAN TO GAIN ON HIM AND AS HIS STRENGTH
DECREASED IT MADE THE WEIGHT OF HIS BURDEN INCREASE
MARIUS WHO WAS
PERHAPS DEAD WEIGHED HIM DOWN AS INERT BODIES WEIGH
JEAN VALJEAN
HELD HIM IN SUCH A MANNER THAT HIS CHEST WAS NOT OPPRESSED AND SO THAT
RESPIRATION COULD PROCEED AS WELL AS POSSIBLE
BETWEEN HIS LEGS HE FELT
THE RAPID GLIDING OF THE RATS
ONE OF THEM WAS FRIGHTENED TO SUCH A
DEGREE THAT HE BIT HIM
FROM TIME TO TIME A BREATH OF FRESH AIR REACHED
HIM THROUGH THE VENT HOLES OF THE MOUTHS OF THE SEWER AND RE ANIMATED
HIM
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THREE HOURS PAST MIDDAY WHEN HE REACHED THE
BELT SEWER
HE WAS AT FIRST ASTONISHED AT THIS SUDDEN WIDENING
HE FOUND HIMSELF
ALL AT ONCE IN A GALLERY WHERE HIS OUTSTRETCHED HANDS COULD NOT REACH
THE TWO WALLS AND BENEATH A VAULT WHICH HIS HEAD DID NOT TOUCH
THE
GRAND SEWER IS IN FACT EIGHT FEET WIDE AND SEVEN FEET HIGH
AT THE POINT WHERE THE MONTMARTRE SEWER JOINS THE GRAND SEWER TWO OTHER
SUBTERRANEAN GALLERIES THAT OF THE RUE DE PROVENCE AND THAT OF THE
ABATTOIR FORM A SQUARE
BETWEEN THESE FOUR WAYS A LESS SAGACIOUS MAN
WOULD HAVE REMAINED UNDECIDED
JEAN VALJEAN SELECTED THE BROADEST THAT
IS TO SAY THE BELT SEWER
BUT HERE THE QUESTION AGAIN CAME UP SHOULD
HE DESCEND OR ASCEND HE THOUGHT THAT THE SITUATION REQUIRED HASTE AND
THAT HE MUST NOW GAIN THE SEINE AT ANY RISK
IN OTHER TERMS HE MUST
DESCEND
HE TURNED TO THE LEFT
IT WAS WELL THAT HE DID SO FOR IT IS AN ERROR TO SUPPOSE THAT THE
BELT SEWER HAS TWO OUTLETS THE ONE IN THE DIRECTION OF BERCY THE OTHER
TOWARDS PASSY AND THAT IT IS AS ITS NAME INDICATES THE SUBTERRANEAN
GIRDLE OF THE PARIS ON THE RIGHT BANK
THE GRAND SEWER WHICH IS IT
MUST BE REMEMBERED NOTHING ELSE THAN THE OLD BROOK OF MENILMONTANT
TERMINATES IF ONE ASCENDS IT IN A BLIND SACK THAT IS TO SAY AT ITS
ANCIENT POINT OF DEPARTURE WHICH WAS ITS SOURCE AT THE FOOT OF THE
KNOLL OF MENILMONTANT
THERE IS NO DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE
BRANCH WHICH COLLECTS THE WATERS OF PARIS BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTIER
POPINCOURT AND WHICH FALLS INTO THE SEINE THROUGH THE AMELOT SEWER
ABOVE THE ANCIENT ISLE LOUVIERS
THIS BRANCH WHICH COMPLETES THE
COLLECTING SEWER IS SEPARATED FROM IT UNDER THE RUE MENILMONTANT
ITSELF BY A PILE WHICH MARKS THE DIVIDING POINT OF THE WATERS BETWEEN
UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM
IF JEAN VALJEAN HAD ASCENDED THE GALLERY HE
WOULD HAVE ARRIVED AFTER A THOUSAND EFFORTS AND BROKEN DOWN WITH
FATIGUE AND IN AN EXPIRING CONDITION IN THE GLOOM AT A WALL
HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN LOST
IN CASE OF NECESSITY BY RETRACING HIS STEPS A LITTLE WAY AND ENTERING
THE PASSAGE OF THE FILLES DU CALVAIRE ON CONDITION THAT HE DID NOT
HESITATE AT THE SUBTERRANEAN CROSSING OF THE CARREFOUR BOUCHERAT AND BY
TAKING THE CORRIDOR SAINT LOUIS THEN THE SAINT GILLES GUT ON THE LEFT
THEN TURNING TO THE RIGHT AND AVOIDING THE SAINT SEBASTIAN GALLERY HE
MIGHT HAVE REACHED THE AMELOT SEWER AND THENCE PROVIDED THAT HE DID
NOT GO ASTRAY IN THE SORT OF F WHICH LIES UNDER THE BASTILLE HE MIGHT
HAVE ATTAINED THE OUTLET ON THE SEINE NEAR THE ARSENAL
BUT IN ORDER
TO DO THIS HE MUST HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH THE ENORMOUS
MADREPORE OF THE SEWER IN ALL ITS RAMIFICATIONS AND IN ALL ITS OPENINGS
NOW WE MUST AGAIN INSIST THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF THAT FRIGHTFUL DRAIN
WHICH HE WAS TRAVERSING AND HAD ANY ONE ASKED HIM IN WHAT HE WAS HE
WOULD HAVE ANSWERED IN THE NIGHT
HIS INSTINCT SERVED HIM WELL
TO DESCEND WAS IN FACT POSSIBLE SAFETY
HE LEFT ON HIS RIGHT THE TWO NARROW PASSAGES WHICH BRANCH OUT IN THE
FORM OF A CLAW UNDER THE RUE LAFFITTE AND THE RUE SAINT GEORGES AND THE
LONG BIFURCATED CORRIDOR OF THE CHAUSSEE D'ANTIN
A LITTLE BEYOND AN AFFLUENT WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE MADELEINE BRANCH
HE HALTED
HE WAS EXTREMELY WEARY
A PASSABLY LARGE AIR HOLE PROBABLY
THE MAN HOLE IN THE RUE D'ANJOU FURNISHED A LIGHT THAT WAS ALMOST
VIVID
JEAN VALJEAN WITH THE GENTLENESS OF MOVEMENT WHICH A BROTHER
WOULD EXERCISE TOWARDS HIS WOUNDED BROTHER DEPOSITED MARIUS ON THE
BANQUETTE OF THE SEWER
MARIUS' BLOOD STAINED FACE APPEARED UNDER THE
WAN LIGHT OF THE AIR HOLE LIKE THE ASHES AT THE BOTTOM OF A TOMB
HIS
EYES WERE CLOSED HIS HAIR WAS PLASTERED DOWN ON HIS TEMPLES LIKE A
PAINTER'S BRUSHES DRIED IN RED WASH HIS HANDS HUNG LIMP AND DEAD
A
CLOT OF BLOOD HAD COLLECTED IN THE KNOT OF HIS CRAVAT HIS LIMBS WERE
COLD AND BLOOD WAS CLOTTED AT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH HIS SHIRT HAD
THRUST ITSELF INTO HIS WOUNDS THE CLOTH OF HIS COAT WAS CHAFING THE
YAWNING GASHES IN THE LIVING FLESH
JEAN VALJEAN PUSHING ASIDE THE
GARMENTS WITH THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS LAID HIS HAND UPON MARIUS'
BREAST HIS HEART WAS STILL BEATING
JEAN VALJEAN TORE UP HIS SHIRT
BANDAGED THE YOUNG MAN'S WOUNDS AS WELL AS HE WAS ABLE AND STOPPED THE
FLOWING BLOOD THEN BENDING OVER MARIUS WHO STILL LAY UNCONSCIOUS
AND ALMOST WITHOUT BREATHING IN THAT HALF LIGHT HE GAZED AT HIM WITH
INEXPRESSIBLE HATRED
ON DISARRANGING MARIUS' GARMENTS HE HAD FOUND TWO THINGS IN HIS
POCKETS THE ROLL WHICH HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN THERE ON THE PRECEDING
EVENING AND MARIUS' POCKETBOOK
HE ATE THE ROLL AND OPENED THE
POCKETBOOK
ON THE FIRST PAGE HE FOUND THE FOUR LINES WRITTEN BY MARIUS
THE READER WILL RECALL THEM
MY NAME IS MARIUS PONTMERCY
CARRY MY BODY TO MY GRANDFATHER M
GILLENORMAND RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE NO
6 IN THE MARAIS
JEAN VALJEAN READ THESE FOUR LINES BY THE LIGHT OF THE AIR HOLE AND
REMAINED FOR A MOMENT AS THOUGH ABSORBED IN THOUGHT REPEATING IN A LOW
TONE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE NUMBER 6 MONSIEUR GILLENORMAND HE
REPLACED THE POCKETBOOK IN MARIUS' POCKET
HE HAD EATEN HIS STRENGTH
HAD RETURNED TO HIM HE TOOK MARIUS UP ONCE MORE UPON HIS BACK PLACED
THE LATTER'S HEAD CAREFULLY ON HIS RIGHT SHOULDER AND RESUMED HIS
DESCENT OF THE SEWER
THE GRAND SEWER DIRECTED ACCORDING TO THE COURSE OF THE VALLEY OF
MENILMONTANT IS ABOUT TWO LEAGUES LONG
IT IS PAVED THROUGHOUT A
NOTABLE PORTION OF ITS EXTENT
THIS TORCH OF THE NAMES OF THE STREETS OF PARIS WITH WHICH WE ARE
ILLUMINATING FOR THE READER JEAN VALJEAN'S SUBTERRANEAN MARCH JEAN
VALJEAN HIMSELF DID NOT POSSESS
NOTHING TOLD HIM WHAT ZONE OF THE CITY
HE WAS TRAVERSING NOR WHAT WAY HE HAD MADE
ONLY THE GROWING PALLOR OF
THE POOLS OF LIGHT WHICH HE ENCOUNTERED FROM TIME TO TIME INDICATED TO
HIM THAT THE SUN WAS WITHDRAWING FROM THE PAVEMENT AND THAT THE DAY
WOULD SOON BE OVER AND THE ROLLING OF VEHICLES OVERHEAD HAVING BECOME
INTERMITTENT INSTEAD OF CONTINUOUS THEN HAVING ALMOST CEASED HE
CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS NO LONGER UNDER CENTRAL PARIS AND THAT HE
WAS APPROACHING SOME SOLITARY REGION IN THE VICINITY OF THE OUTER
BOULEVARDS OR THE EXTREME OUTER QUAYS
WHERE THERE ARE FEWER HOUSES AND
STREETS THE SEWER HAS FEWER AIR HOLES
THE GLOOM DEEPENED AROUND JEAN
VALJEAN
NEVERTHELESS HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE GROPING HIS WAY IN THE
DARK
SUDDENLY THIS DARKNESS BECAME TERRIBLE
CHAPTER V IN THE CASE OF SAND AS IN THAT OF WOMAN THERE IS A FINENESS
WHICH IS TREACHEROUS
HE FELT THAT HE WAS ENTERING THE WATER AND THAT HE NO LONGER HAD A
PAVEMENT UNDER HIS FEET BUT ONLY MUD
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT ON CERTAIN SHORES OF BRETAGNE OR SCOTLAND A
MAN EITHER A TRAVELLER OR A FISHERMAN WHILE WALKING AT LOW TIDE ON THE
BEACH FAR FROM SHORE SUDDENLY NOTICES THAT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES PAST
HE HAS BEEN WALKING WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
THE BEACH UNDER FOOT IS
LIKE PITCH HIS SOLES STICK FAST TO IT IT IS NO LONGER SAND IT IS
BIRD LIME
THE STRAND IS PERFECTLY DRY BUT AT EVERY STEP THAT HE TAKES
AS SOON AS THE FOOT IS RAISED THE PRINT IS FILLED WITH WATER
THE
EYE HOWEVER HAS PERCEIVED NO CHANGE THE IMMENSE BEACH IS SMOOTH AND
TRANQUIL ALL THE SAND HAS THE SAME ASPECT NOTHING DISTINGUISHES THE
SOIL THAT IS SOLID FROM THAT WHICH IS NOT SOLID THE JOYOUS LITTLE
CLOUD OF SAND LICE CONTINUES TO LEAP TUMULTUOUSLY UNDER THE FEET OF THE
PASSER BY
THE MAN PURSUES HIS WAY HE WALKS ON TURNS TOWARDS THE LAND ENDEAVORS
TO APPROACH THE SHORE
HE IS NOT UNEASY
UNEASY ABOUT WHAT ONLY HE IS
CONSCIOUS THAT THE HEAVINESS OF HIS FEET SEEMS TO BE INCREASING AT EVERY
STEP THAT HE TAKES
ALL AT ONCE HE SINKS IN
HE SINKS IN TWO OR THREE
INCHES
DECIDEDLY HE IS NOT ON THE RIGHT ROAD HE HALTS TO GET HIS
BEARINGS
SUDDENLY HE GLANCES AT HIS FEET HIS FEET HAVE DISAPPEARED
THE SAND HAS COVERED THEM
HE DRAWS HIS FEET OUT OF THE SAND HE TRIES
TO RETRACE HIS STEPS HE TURNS BACK HE SINKS IN MORE DEEPLY THAN
BEFORE
THE SAND IS UP TO HIS ANKLES HE TEARS HIMSELF FREE FROM IT
AND FLINGS HIMSELF TO THE LEFT THE SAND REACHES TO MID LEG HE FLINGS
HIMSELF TO THE RIGHT THE SAND COMES UP TO HIS KNEES
THEN WITH
INDESCRIBABLE TERROR HE RECOGNIZES THE FACT THAT HE IS CAUGHT IN A
QUICKSAND AND THAT HE HAS BENEATH HIM THAT FRIGHTFUL MEDIUM IN WHICH
NEITHER MAN CAN WALK NOR FISH CAN SWIM
HE FLINGS AWAY HIS BURDEN IF HE
HAVE ONE HE LIGHTENS HIMSELF LIKE A SHIP IN DISTRESS IT IS TOO LATE
THE SAND IS ABOVE HIS KNEES
HE SHOUTS HE WAVES HIS HAT OR HIS HANDKERCHIEF THE SAND CONTINUALLY
GAINS ON HIM IF THE BEACH IS DESERTED IF THE LAND IS TOO FAR AWAY IF
THE BANK OF SAND IS TOO ILL FAMED THERE IS NO HERO IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
ALL IS OVER HE IS CONDEMNED TO BE ENGULFED
HE IS CONDEMNED TO THAT
TERRIBLE INTERMENT LONG INFALLIBLE IMPLACABLE WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO EITHER RETARD OR HASTEN WHICH LASTS FOR HOURS WHICH WILL NOT COME
TO AN END WHICH SEIZES YOU ERECT FREE IN THE FLUSH OF HEALTH WHICH
DRAGS YOU DOWN BY THE FEET WHICH AT EVERY EFFORT THAT YOU ATTEMPT AT
EVERY SHOUT THAT YOU UTTER DRAWS YOU A LITTLE LOWER WHICH HAS THE AIR
OF PUNISHING YOU FOR YOUR RESISTANCE BY A REDOUBLED GRASP WHICH FORCES
A MAN TO RETURN SLOWLY TO EARTH WHILE LEAVING HIM TIME TO SURVEY THE
HORIZON THE TREES THE VERDANT COUNTRY THE SMOKE OF THE VILLAGES ON
THE PLAIN THE SAILS OF THE SHIPS ON THE SEA THE BIRDS WHICH FLY
AND SING THE SUN AND THE SKY
THIS ENGULFMENT IS THE SEPULCHRE WHICH
ASSUMES A TIDE AND WHICH MOUNTS FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH TOWARDS
A LIVING MAN
EACH MINUTE IS AN INEXORABLE LAYER OUT OF THE DEAD
THE
WRETCHED MAN TRIES TO SIT DOWN TO LIE DOWN TO CLIMB EVERY MOVEMENT
THAT HE MAKES BURIES HIM DEEPER HE STRAIGHTENS HIMSELF UP HE SINKS HE
FEELS THAT HE IS BEING SWALLOWED UP HE SHRIEKS IMPLORES CRIES TO THE
CLOUDS WRINGS HIS HANDS GROWS DESPERATE
BEHOLD HIM IN THE SAND UP
TO HIS BELLY THE SAND REACHES TO HIS BREAST HE IS ONLY A BUST NOW
HE UPLIFTS HIS HANDS UTTERS FURIOUS GROANS CLENCHES HIS NAILS ON THE
BEACH TRIES TO CLING FAST TO THAT ASHES SUPPORTS HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOWS
IN ORDER TO RAISE HIMSELF FROM THAT SOFT SHEATH AND SOBS FRANTICALLY
THE SAND MOUNTS HIGHER
THE SAND HAS REACHED HIS SHOULDERS THE SAND
REACHES TO HIS THROAT ONLY HIS FACE IS VISIBLE NOW
HIS MOUTH CRIES
ALOUD THE SAND FILLS IT SILENCE
HIS EYES STILL GAZE FORTH THE SAND
CLOSES THEM NIGHT
THEN HIS BROW DECREASES A LITTLE HAIR QUIVERS ABOVE
THE SAND A HAND PROJECTS PIERCES THE SURFACE OF THE BEACH WAVES AND
DISAPPEARS
SINISTER OBLITERATION OF A MAN
SOMETIMES A RIDER IS ENGULFED WITH HIS HORSE SOMETIMES THE CARTER IS
SWALLOWED UP WITH HIS CART ALL FOUNDERS IN THAT STRAND
IT IS SHIPWRECK
ELSEWHERE THAN IN THE WATER
IT IS THE EARTH DROWNING A MAN
THE EARTH
PERMEATED WITH THE OCEAN BECOMES A PITFALL
IT PRESENTS ITSELF IN THE
GUISE OF A PLAIN AND IT YAWNS LIKE A WAVE
THE ABYSS IS SUBJECT TO
THESE TREACHERIES
THIS MELANCHOLY FATE ALWAYS POSSIBLE ON CERTAIN SEA BEACHES WAS ALSO
POSSIBLE THIRTY YEARS AGO IN THE SEWERS OF PARIS
BEFORE THE IMPORTANT WORKS UNDERTAKEN IN 1833 THE SUBTERRANEAN DRAIN
OF PARIS WAS SUBJECT TO THESE SUDDEN SLIDES
THE WATER FILTERED INTO CERTAIN SUBJACENT STRATA WHICH WERE
PARTICULARLY FRIABLE THE FOOT WAY WHICH WAS OF FLAG STONES AS IN
THE ANCIENT SEWERS OR OF CEMENT ON CONCRETE AS IN THE NEW GALLERIES
HAVING NO LONGER AN UNDERPINNING GAVE WAY
A FOLD IN A FLOORING OF THIS
SORT MEANS A CRACK MEANS CRUMBLING
THE FRAMEWORK CRUMBLED AWAY FOR A
CERTAIN LENGTH
THIS CREVICE THE HIATUS OF A GULF OF MIRE WAS CALLED A
FONTIS IN THE SPECIAL TONGUE
WHAT IS A FONTIS IT IS THE QUICKSANDS OF
THE SEASHORE SUDDENLY ENCOUNTERED UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IT IS
THE BEACH OF MONT SAINT MICHEL IN A SEWER
THE SOAKED SOIL IS IN A
STATE OF FUSION AS IT WERE ALL ITS MOLECULES ARE IN SUSPENSION IN SOFT
MEDIUM IT IS NOT EARTH AND IT IS NOT WATER
THE DEPTH IS SOMETIMES VERY
GREAT
NOTHING CAN BE MORE FORMIDABLE THAN SUCH AN ENCOUNTER
IF THE
WATER PREDOMINATES DEATH IS PROMPT THE MAN IS SWALLOWED UP IF EARTH
PREDOMINATES DEATH IS SLOW
CAN ANY ONE PICTURE TO HIMSELF SUCH A DEATH IF BEING SWALLOWED BY THE
EARTH IS TERRIBLE ON THE SEASHORE WHAT IS IT IN A CESS POOL INSTEAD OF
THE OPEN AIR THE BROAD DAYLIGHT THE CLEAR HORIZON THOSE VAST SOUNDS
THOSE FREE CLOUDS WHENCE RAINS LIFE INSTEAD OF THOSE BARKS DESCRIED
IN THE DISTANCE OF THAT HOPE UNDER ALL SORTS OF FORMS OF PROBABLE
PASSERS BY OF SUCCOR POSSIBLE UP TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT INSTEAD
OF ALL THIS DEAFNESS BLINDNESS A BLACK VAULT THE INSIDE OF A TOMB
ALREADY PREPARED DEATH IN THE MIRE BENEATH A COVER SLOW SUFFOCATION
BY FILTH A STONE BOX WHERE ASPHYXIA OPENS ITS CLAW IN THE MIRE AND
CLUTCHES YOU BY THE THROAT FETIDNESS MINGLED WITH THE DEATH RATTLE
SLIME INSTEAD OF THE STRAND SULFURETTED HYDROGEN IN PLACE OF THE
HURRICANE DUNG IN PLACE OF THE OCEAN AND TO SHOUT TO GNASH ONE'S
TEETH AND TO WRITHE AND TO STRUGGLE AND TO AGONIZE WITH THAT
ENORMOUS CITY WHICH KNOWS NOTHING OF IT ALL OVER ONE'S HEAD
INEXPRESSIBLE IS THE HORROR OF DYING THUS DEATH SOMETIMES REDEEMS
HIS ATROCITY BY A CERTAIN TERRIBLE DIGNITY
ON THE FUNERAL PILE IN
SHIPWRECK ONE CAN BE GREAT IN THE FLAMES AS IN THE FOAM A SUPERB
ATTITUDE IS POSSIBLE ONE THERE BECOMES TRANSFIGURED AS ONE PERISHES
BUT NOT HERE
DEATH IS FILTHY
IT IS HUMILIATING TO EXPIRE
THE SUPREME
FLOATING VISIONS ARE ABJECT
MUD IS SYNONYMOUS WITH SHAME
IT IS
PETTY UGLY INFAMOUS
TO DIE IN A BUTT OF MALVOISIE LIKE CLARENCE IS
PERMISSIBLE IN THE DITCH OF A SCAVENGER LIKE ESCOUBLEAU IS HORRIBLE
TO STRUGGLE THEREIN IS HIDEOUS AT THE SAME TIME THAT ONE IS GOING
THROUGH THE DEATH AGONY ONE IS FLOUNDERING ABOUT
THERE ARE SHADOWS
ENOUGH FOR HELL AND MIRE ENOUGH TO RENDER IT NOTHING BUT A SLOUGH AND
THE DYING MAN KNOWS NOT WHETHER HE IS ON THE POINT OF BECOMING A SPECTRE
OR A FROG
EVERYWHERE ELSE THE SEPULCHRE IS SINISTER HERE IT IS DEFORMED
THE DEPTH OF THE FONTIS VARIED AS WELL AS THEIR LENGTH AND THEIR
DENSITY ACCORDING TO THE MORE OR LESS BAD QUALITY OF THE SUB SOIL
SOMETIMES A FONTIS WAS THREE OR FOUR FEET DEEP SOMETIMES EIGHT OR TEN
SOMETIMES THE BOTTOM WAS UNFATHOMABLE
HERE THE MIRE WAS ALMOST SOLID
THERE ALMOST LIQUID
IN THE LUNIERE FONTIS IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A MAN A
DAY TO DISAPPEAR WHILE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEVOURED IN FIVE MINUTES BY
THE PHILIPPEAUX SLOUGH
THE MIRE BEARS UP MORE OR LESS ACCORDING TO ITS
DENSITY
A CHILD CAN ESCAPE WHERE A MAN WILL PERISH
THE FIRST LAW OF
SAFETY IS TO GET RID OF EVERY SORT OF LOAD
EVERY SEWERMAN WHO FELT THE
GROUND GIVING WAY BENEATH HIM BEGAN BY FLINGING AWAY HIS SACK OF TOOLS
OR HIS BACK BASKET OR HIS HOD
THE FONTIS WERE DUE TO DIFFERENT CAUSES THE FRIABILITY OF THE SOIL
SOME LANDSLIP AT A DEPTH BEYOND THE REACH OF MAN THE VIOLENT SUMMER
RAINS THE INCESSANT FLOODING OF WINTER LONG DRIZZLING SHOWERS
SOMETIMES THE WEIGHT OF THE SURROUNDING HOUSES ON A MARLY OR SANDY SOIL
FORCED OUT THE VAULTS OF THE SUBTERRANEAN GALLERIES AND CAUSED THEM TO
BEND ASIDE OR IT CHANCED THAT A FLOORING VAULT BURST AND SPLIT UNDER
THIS CRUSHING THRUST
IN THIS MANNER THE HEAPING UP OF THE PARTHENON
OBLITERATED A CENTURY AGO A PORTION OF THE VAULTS OF SAINT GENEVIEVE
HILL
WHEN A SEWER WAS BROKEN IN UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE HOUSES THE
MISCHIEF WAS SOMETIMES BETRAYED IN THE STREET ABOVE BY A SORT OF SPACE
LIKE THE TEETH OF A SAW BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES THIS CREVICE WAS
DEVELOPED IN AN UNDULATING LINE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE
CRACKED VAULT AND THEN THE EVIL BEING VISIBLE THE REMEDY COULD BE
PROMPTLY APPLIED
IT ALSO FREQUENTLY HAPPENED THAT THE INTERIOR RAVAGES
WERE NOT REVEALED BY ANY EXTERNAL SCAR AND IN THAT CASE WOE TO THE
SEWERMEN
WHEN THEY ENTERED WITHOUT PRECAUTION INTO THE SEWER THEY WERE
LIABLE TO BE LOST
ANCIENT REGISTERS MAKE MENTION OF SEVERAL SCAVENGERS
WHO WERE BURIED IN FONTIS IN THIS MANNER
THEY GIVE MANY NAMES AMONG
OTHERS THAT OF THE SEWERMAN WHO WAS SWALLOWED UP IN A QUAGMIRE UNDER
THE MAN HOLE OF THE RUE CAREME PRENANT A CERTAIN BLAISE POUTRAIN THIS
BLAISE POUTRAIN WAS THE BROTHER OF NICHOLAS POUTRAIN WHO WAS THE LAST
GRAVE DIGGER OF THE CEMETERY CALLED THE CHARNIER DES INNOCENTS IN 1785
THE EPOCH WHEN THAT CEMETERY EXPIRED
THERE WAS ALSO THAT YOUNG AND CHARMING VICOMTE D'ESCOUBLEAU OF WHOM WE
HAVE JUST SPOKEN ONE OF THE HEROES OF THE SIEGE OF LERIDA WHERE THEY
DELIVERED THE ASSAULT IN SILK STOCKINGS WITH VIOLINS AT THEIR HEAD
D'ESCOUBLEAU SURPRISED ONE NIGHT AT HIS COUSIN'S THE DUCHESS DE
SOURDIS' WAS DROWNED IN A QUAGMIRE OF THE BEAUTREILLIS SEWER IN WHICH
HE HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THE DUKE
MADAME DE SOURDIS
WHEN INFORMED OF HIS DEATH DEMANDED HER SMELLING BOTTLE AND FORGOT TO
WEEP THROUGH SNIFFLING AT HER SALTS
IN SUCH CASES THERE IS NO LOVE
WHICH HOLDS FAST THE SEWER EXTINGUISHES IT
HERO REFUSES TO WASH THE
BODY OF LEANDER
THISBE STOPS HER NOSE IN THE PRESENCE OF PYRAMUS AND
SAYS PHEW
CHAPTER VI THE FONTIS
JEAN VALJEAN FOUND HIMSELF IN THE PRESENCE OF A FONTIS
THIS SORT OF QUAGMIRE WAS COMMON AT THAT PERIOD IN THE SUBSOIL OF THE
CHAMPS ELYSEES DIFFICULT TO HANDLE IN THE HYDRAULIC WORKS AND A BAD
PRESERVATIVE OF THE SUBTERRANEAN CONSTRUCTIONS ON ACCOUNT OF ITS
EXCESSIVE FLUIDITY
THIS FLUIDITY EXCEEDS EVEN THE INCONSISTENCY OF THE
SANDS OF THE QUARTIER SAINT GEORGES WHICH COULD ONLY BE CONQUERED BY
A STONE CONSTRUCTION ON A CONCRETE FOUNDATION AND THE CLAYEY STRATA
INFECTED WITH GAS OF THE QUARTIER DES MARTYRS WHICH ARE SO LIQUID
THAT THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH A PASSAGE WAS EFFECTED UNDER THE GALLERY DES
MARTYRS WAS BY MEANS OF A CAST IRON PIPE
WHEN IN 1836 THE OLD STONE
SEWER BENEATH THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE IN WHICH WE NOW SEE JEAN
VALJEAN WAS DEMOLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECONSTRUCTING IT THE
QUICKSAND WHICH FORMS THE SUBSOIL OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES AS FAR AS THE
SEINE PRESENTED SUCH AN OBSTACLE THAT THE OPERATION LASTED NEARLY
SIX MONTHS TO THE GREAT CLAMOR OF THE DWELLERS ON THE RIVERSIDE
PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAD HOTELS AND CARRIAGES
THE WORK WAS MORE THAN
UNHEALTHY IT WAS DANGEROUS
IT IS TRUE THAT THEY HAD FOUR MONTHS AND A
HALF OF RAIN AND THREE FLOODS OF THE SEINE
THE FONTIS WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAD ENCOUNTERED WAS CAUSED BY THE DOWNPOUR
OF THE PRECEDING DAY
THE PAVEMENT BADLY SUSTAINED BY THE SUBJACENT
SAND HAD GIVEN WAY AND HAD PRODUCED A STOPPAGE OF THE WATER
INFILTRATION HAD TAKEN PLACE A SLIP HAD FOLLOWED
THE DISLOCATED BOTTOM
HAD SUNK INTO THE OOZE
TO WHAT EXTENT IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
THE OBSCURITY
WAS MORE DENSE THERE THAN ELSEWHERE
IT WAS A PIT OF MIRE IN A CAVERN OF
NIGHT
JEAN VALJEAN FELT THE PAVEMENT VANISHING BENEATH HIS FEET
HE ENTERED
THIS SLIME
THERE WAS WATER ON THE SURFACE SLIME AT THE BOTTOM
HE MUST
PASS IT
TO RETRACE HIS STEPS WAS IMPOSSIBLE
MARIUS WAS DYING AND JEAN
VALJEAN EXHAUSTED
BESIDES WHERE WAS HE TO GO JEAN VALJEAN ADVANCED
MOREOVER THE PIT SEEMED FOR THE FIRST FEW STEPS NOT TO BE VERY DEEP
BUT IN PROPORTION AS HE ADVANCED HIS FEET PLUNGED DEEPER
SOON HE HAD
THE SLIME UP TO HIS CALVES AND WATER ABOVE HIS KNEES
HE WALKED ON
RAISING MARIUS IN HIS ARMS AS FAR ABOVE THE WATER AS HE COULD
THE MIRE
NOW REACHED TO HIS KNEES AND THE WATER TO HIS WAIST
HE COULD NO LONGER
RETREAT
THIS MUD DENSE ENOUGH FOR ONE MAN COULD NOT OBVIOUSLY
UPHOLD TWO
MARIUS AND JEAN VALJEAN WOULD HAVE STOOD A CHANCE OF
EXTRICATING THEMSELVES SINGLY
JEAN VALJEAN CONTINUED TO ADVANCE
SUPPORTING THE DYING MAN WHO WAS PERHAPS A CORPSE
THE WATER CAME UP TO HIS ARM PITS HE FELT THAT HE WAS SINKING IT WAS
ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY THAT HE COULD MOVE IN THE DEPTH OF OOZE WHICH
HE HAD NOW REACHED
THE DENSITY WHICH WAS HIS SUPPORT WAS ALSO
AN OBSTACLE
HE STILL HELD MARIUS ON HIGH AND WITH AN UNHEARD OF
EXPENDITURE OF FORCE HE ADVANCED STILL BUT HE WAS SINKING
HE HAD ONLY
HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER NOW AND HIS TWO ARMS HOLDING UP MARIUS
IN THE
OLD PAINTINGS OF THE DELUGE THERE IS A MOTHER HOLDING HER CHILD THUS
HE SANK STILL DEEPER HE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE REAR TO ESCAPE THE
WATER AND IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BREATHE ANYONE WHO HAD
SEEN HIM IN THAT GLOOM WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WHAT HE BEHELD WAS A
MASK FLOATING ON THE SHADOWS HE CAUGHT A FAINT GLIMPSE ABOVE HIM OF THE
DROOPING HEAD AND LIVID FACE OF MARIUS HE MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT AND
LAUNCHED HIS FOOT FORWARD HIS FOOT STRUCK SOMETHING SOLID A POINT OF
SUPPORT
IT WAS HIGH TIME
HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AND ROOTED HIMSELF UPON THAT POINT OF
SUPPORT WITH A SORT OF FURY
THIS PRODUCED UPON HIM THE EFFECT OF THE
FIRST STEP IN A STAIRCASE LEADING BACK TO LIFE
THE POINT OF SUPPORT THUS ENCOUNTERED IN THE MIRE AT THE SUPREME
MOMENT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE OTHER WATER SHED OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH
HAD BENT BUT HAD NOT GIVEN WAY AND WHICH HAD CURVED UNDER THE WATER
LIKE A PLANK AND IN A SINGLE PIECE
WELL BUILT PAVEMENTS FORM A VAULT
AND POSSESS THIS SORT OF FIRMNESS
THIS FRAGMENT OF THE VAULTING PARTLY
SUBMERGED BUT SOLID WAS A VERITABLE INCLINED PLANE AND ONCE ON THIS
PLANE HE WAS SAFE
JEAN VALJEAN MOUNTED THIS INCLINED PLANE AND REACHED
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUAGMIRE
AS HE EMERGED FROM THE WATER HE CAME IN CONTACT WITH A STONE AND FELL
UPON HIS KNEES
HE REFLECTED THAT THIS WAS BUT JUST AND HE REMAINED
THERE FOR SOME TIME WITH HIS SOUL ABSORBED IN WORDS ADDRESSED TO GOD
HE ROSE TO HIS FEET SHIVERING CHILLED FOUL SMELLING BOWED BENEATH
THE DYING MAN WHOM HE WAS DRAGGING AFTER HIM ALL DRIPPING WITH SLIME
AND HIS SOUL FILLED WITH A STRANGE LIGHT
CHAPTER VII ONE SOMETIMES RUNS AGROUND WHEN ONE FANCIES THAT ONE IS
DISEMBARKING
HE SET OUT ON HIS WAY ONCE MORE
HOWEVER ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT LEFT HIS LIFE IN THE FONTIS HE SEEMED
TO HAVE LEFT HIS STRENGTH BEHIND HIM THERE
THAT SUPREME EFFORT HAD
EXHAUSTED HIM
HIS LASSITUDE WAS NOW SUCH THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE
FOR BREATH EVERY THREE OR FOUR STEPS AND LEAN AGAINST THE WALL
ONCE
HE WAS FORCED TO SEAT HIMSELF ON THE BANQUETTE IN ORDER TO ALTER MARIUS'
POSITION AND HE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TO REMAIN THERE
BUT IF HIS
VIGOR WAS DEAD HIS ENERGY WAS NOT
HE ROSE AGAIN
HE WALKED ON DESPERATELY ALMOST FAST PROCEEDED THUS FOR A HUNDRED
PACES ALMOST WITHOUT DRAWING BREATH AND SUDDENLY CAME IN CONTACT WITH
THE WALL
HE HAD REACHED AN ELBOW OF THE SEWER AND ARRIVING AT THE
TURN WITH HEAD BENT DOWN HE HAD STRUCK THE WALL
HE RAISED HIS EYES
AND AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE VAULT FAR VERY FAR AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM
HE PERCEIVED A LIGHT
THIS TIME IT WAS NOT THAT TERRIBLE LIGHT IT WAS
GOOD WHITE LIGHT
IT WAS DAYLIGHT
JEAN VALJEAN SAW THE OUTLET
A DAMNED SOUL WHO IN THE MIDST OF THE FURNACE SHOULD SUDDENLY
PERCEIVE THE OUTLET OF GEHENNA WOULD EXPERIENCE WHAT JEAN VALJEAN FELT
IT WOULD FLY WILDLY WITH THE STUMPS OF ITS BURNED WINGS TOWARDS THAT
RADIANT PORTAL
JEAN VALJEAN WAS NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF FATIGUE HE NO
LONGER FELT MARIUS' WEIGHT HE FOUND HIS LEGS ONCE MORE OF STEEL HE RAN
RATHER THAN WALKED
AS HE APPROACHED THE OUTLET BECAME MORE AND MORE
DISTINCTLY DEFINED
IT WAS A POINTED ARCH LOWER THAN THE VAULT WHICH
GRADUALLY NARROWED AND NARROWER THAN THE GALLERY WHICH CLOSED IN AS
THE VAULT GREW LOWER
THE TUNNEL ENDED LIKE THE INTERIOR OF A FUNNEL
A FAULTY CONSTRUCTION IMITATED FROM THE WICKETS OF PENITENTIARIES
LOGICAL IN A PRISON ILLOGICAL IN A SEWER AND WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN
CORRECTED
JEAN VALJEAN REACHED THE OUTLET
THERE HE HALTED
IT CERTAINLY WAS THE OUTLET BUT HE COULD NOT GET OUT
THE ARCH WAS CLOSED BY A HEAVY GRATING AND THE GRATING WHICH TO ALL
APPEARANCE RARELY SWUNG ON ITS RUSTY HINGES WAS CLAMPED TO ITS STONE
JAMB BY A THICK LOCK WHICH RED WITH RUST SEEMED LIKE AN ENORMOUS
BRICK
THE KEYHOLE COULD BE SEEN AND THE ROBUST LATCH DEEPLY SUNK IN
THE IRON STAPLE
THE DOOR WAS PLAINLY DOUBLE LOCKED
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE
PRISON LOCKS WHICH OLD PARIS WAS SO FOND OF LAVISHING
BEYOND THE GRATING WAS THE OPEN AIR THE RIVER THE DAYLIGHT THE SHORE
VERY NARROW BUT SUFFICIENT FOR ESCAPE
THE DISTANT QUAYS PARIS THAT
GULF IN WHICH ONE SO EASILY HIDES ONESELF THE BROAD HORIZON LIBERTY
ON THE RIGHT DOWN STREAM THE BRIDGE OF JENA WAS DISCERNIBLE ON THE
LEFT UPSTREAM THE BRIDGE OF THE INVALIDES THE PLACE WOULD HAVE BEEN A
PROPITIOUS ONE IN WHICH TO AWAIT THE NIGHT AND TO ESCAPE
IT WAS ONE
OF THE MOST SOLITARY POINTS IN PARIS THE SHORE WHICH FACES THE
GRAND CAILLOU
FLIES WERE ENTERING AND EMERGING THROUGH THE BARS OF THE
GRATING
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF PAST EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
THE DAY WAS
DECLINING
JEAN VALJEAN LAID MARIUS DOWN ALONG THE WALL ON THE DRY PORTION OF THE
VAULTING THEN HE WENT TO THE GRATING AND CLENCHED BOTH FISTS ROUND THE
BARS THE SHOCK WHICH HE GAVE IT WAS FRENZIED BUT IT DID NOT MOVE
THE
GRATING DID NOT STIR
JEAN VALJEAN SEIZED THE BARS ONE AFTER THE OTHER
IN THE HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TEAR AWAY THE LEAST SOLID AND TO
MAKE OF IT A LEVER WHEREWITH TO RAISE THE DOOR OR TO BREAK THE LOCK
NOT
A BAR STIRRED
THE TEETH OF A TIGER ARE NOT MORE FIRMLY FIXED IN THEIR
SOCKETS
NO LEVER NO PRYING POSSIBLE
THE OBSTACLE WAS INVINCIBLE
THERE WAS NO MEANS OF OPENING THE GATE
MUST HE THEN STOP THERE WHAT WAS HE TO DO WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HIM
HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO RETRACE HIS STEPS TO RECOMMENCE THE JOURNEY
WHICH HE HAD ALREADY TAKEN
BESIDES HOW WAS HE TO AGAIN TRAVERSE THAT
QUAGMIRE WHENCE HE HAD ONLY EXTRICATED HIMSELF AS BY A MIRACLE AND
AFTER THE QUAGMIRE WAS THERE NOT THE POLICE PATROL WHICH ASSUREDLY
COULD NOT BE TWICE AVOIDED AND THEN WHITHER WAS HE TO GO WHAT
DIRECTION SHOULD HE PURSUE TO FOLLOW THE INCLINE WOULD NOT CONDUCT
HIM TO HIS GOAL
IF HE WERE TO REACH ANOTHER OUTLET HE WOULD FIND IT
OBSTRUCTED BY A PLUG OR A GRATING
EVERY OUTLET WAS UNDOUBTEDLY CLOSED
IN THAT MANNER
CHANCE HAD UNSEALED THE GRATING THROUGH WHICH HE HAD
ENTERED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT ALL THE OTHER SEWER MOUTHS WERE BARRED
HE HAD ONLY SUCCEEDED IN ESCAPING INTO A PRISON
ALL WAS OVER
EVERYTHING THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD DONE WAS USELESS
EXHAUSTION HAD ENDED IN FAILURE
THEY WERE BOTH CAUGHT IN THE IMMENSE AND GLOOMY WEB OF DEATH AND JEAN
VALJEAN FELT THE TERRIBLE SPIDER RUNNING ALONG THOSE BLACK STRANDS AND
QUIVERING IN THE SHADOWS
HE TURNED HIS BACK TO THE GRATING AND FELL
UPON THE PAVEMENT HURLED TO EARTH RATHER THAN SEATED CLOSE TO MARIUS
WHO STILL MADE NO MOVEMENT AND WITH HIS HEAD BENT BETWEEN HIS KNEES
THIS WAS THE LAST DROP OF ANGUISH
OF WHAT WAS HE THINKING DURING THIS PROFOUND DEPRESSION NEITHER OF
HIMSELF NOR OF MARIUS
HE WAS THINKING OF COSETTE
CHAPTER VIII THE TORN COAT TAIL
IN THE MIDST OF THIS PROSTRATION A HAND WAS LAID ON HIS SHOULDER AND A
LOW VOICE SAID TO HIM
HALF SHARES
SOME PERSON IN THAT GLOOM NOTHING SO CLOSELY RESEMBLES A DREAM AS
DESPAIR
JEAN VALJEAN THOUGHT THAT HE WAS DREAMING
HE HAD HEARD NO
FOOTSTEPS
WAS IT POSSIBLE HE RAISED HIS EYES
A MAN STOOD BEFORE HIM
THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BLOUSE HIS FEET WERE BARE HE HELD HIS SHOES
IN HIS LEFT HAND HE HAD EVIDENTLY REMOVED THEM IN ORDER TO REACH JEAN
VALJEAN WITHOUT ALLOWING HIS STEPS TO BE HEARD
JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT HESITATE FOR AN INSTANT
UNEXPECTED AS WAS THIS
ENCOUNTER THIS MAN WAS KNOWN TO HIM
THE MAN WAS THENARDIER
ALTHOUGH AWAKENED SO TO SPEAK WITH A START JEAN VALJEAN ACCUSTOMED
TO ALARMS AND STEELED TO UNFORESEEN SHOCKS THAT MUST BE PROMPTLY
PARRIED INSTANTLY REGAINED POSSESSION OF HIS PRESENCE OF MIND
MOREOVER THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE MADE WORSE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF
DISTRESS IS NO LONGER CAPABLE OF A CRESCENDO AND THENARDIER HIMSELF
COULD ADD NOTHING TO THIS BLACKNESS OF THIS NIGHT
A MOMENTARY PAUSE ENSUED
THENARDIER RAISING HIS RIGHT HAND TO A LEVEL WITH HIS FOREHEAD FORMED
WITH IT A SHADE THEN HE BROUGHT HIS EYELASHES TOGETHER BY SCREWING UP
HIS EYES A MOTION WHICH IN CONNECTION WITH A SLIGHT CONTRACTION OF THE
MOUTH CHARACTERIZES THE SAGACIOUS ATTENTION OF A MAN WHO IS ENDEAVORING
TO RECOGNIZE ANOTHER MAN
HE DID NOT SUCCEED
JEAN VALJEAN AS WE HAVE
JUST STATED HAD HIS BACK TURNED TO THE LIGHT AND HE WAS MOREOVER
SO DISFIGURED SO BEMIRED SO BLEEDING THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
UNRECOGNIZABLE IN FULL NOONDAY
ON THE CONTRARY ILLUMINATED BY THE
LIGHT FROM THE GRATING A CELLAR LIGHT IT IS TRUE LIVID YET PRECISE
IN ITS LIVIDNESS THENARDIER AS THE ENERGETIC POPULAR METAPHOR
EXPRESSES IT IMMEDIATELY LEAPED INTO JEAN VALJEAN'S EYES
THIS
INEQUALITY OF CONDITIONS SUFFICED TO ASSURE SOME ADVANTAGE TO JEAN
VALJEAN IN THAT MYSTERIOUS DUEL WHICH WAS ON THE POINT OF BEGINNING
BETWEEN THE TWO SITUATIONS AND THE TWO MEN
THE ENCOUNTER TOOK PLACE
BETWEEN JEAN VALJEAN VEILED AND THENARDIER UNMASKED
JEAN VALJEAN IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED THAT THENARDIER DID NOT RECOGNIZE
HIM
THEY SURVEYED EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT IN THAT HALF GLOOM AS THOUGH
TAKING EACH OTHER'S MEASURE
THENARDIER WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE
SILENCE
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE TO GET OUT
JEAN VALJEAN MADE NO REPLY
THENARDIER CONTINUED
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PICK THE LOCK OF THAT GATE
BUT STILL YOU MUST GET
OUT OF THIS
THAT IS TRUE SAID JEAN VALJEAN
WELL HALF SHARES THEN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
YOU HAVE KILLED THAT MAN THAT'S ALL RIGHT
I HAVE THE KEY
THENARDIER POINTED TO MARIUS
HE WENT ON
I DON'T KNOW YOU BUT I WANT TO HELP YOU
YOU MUST BE A FRIEND
JEAN VALJEAN BEGAN TO COMPREHEND
THENARDIER TOOK HIM FOR AN ASSASSIN
THENARDIER RESUMED
LISTEN COMRADE
YOU DIDN'T KILL THAT MAN WITHOUT LOOKING TO SEE WHAT
HE HAD IN HIS POCKETS
GIVE ME MY HALF
I'LL OPEN THE DOOR FOR YOU
AND HALF DRAWING FROM BENEATH HIS TATTERED BLOUSE A HUGE KEY HE ADDED
DO YOU WANT TO SEE HOW A KEY TO LIBERTY IS MADE LOOK HERE
JEAN VALJEAN REMAINED STUPID THE EXPRESSION BELONGS TO THE ELDER
CORNEILLE TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE DOUBTED WHETHER WHAT HE BEHELD WAS
REAL
IT WAS PROVIDENCE APPEARING IN HORRIBLE GUISE AND HIS GOOD ANGEL
SPRINGING FROM THE EARTH IN THE FORM OF THENARDIER
THENARDIER THRUST HIS FIST INTO A LARGE POCKET CONCEALED UNDER HIS
BLOUSE DREW OUT A ROPE AND OFFERED IT TO JEAN VALJEAN
HOLD ON SAID HE I'LL GIVE YOU THE ROPE TO BOOT
WHAT IS THE ROPE FOR
YOU WILL NEED A STONE ALSO BUT YOU CAN FIND ONE OUTSIDE
THERE'S A
HEAP OF RUBBISH
WHAT AM I TO DO WITH A STONE
IDIOT YOU'LL WANT TO SLING THAT STIFF INTO THE RIVER YOU'LL NEED A
STONE AND A ROPE OTHERWISE IT WOULD FLOAT ON THE WATER
JEAN VALJEAN TOOK THE ROPE
THERE IS NO ONE WHO DOES NOT OCCASIONALLY
ACCEPT IN THIS MECHANICAL WAY
THENARDIER SNAPPED HIS FINGERS AS THOUGH AN IDEA HAD SUDDENLY OCCURRED
TO HIM
AH SEE HERE COMRADE HOW DID YOU CONTRIVE TO GET OUT OF THAT SLOUGH
YONDER I HAVEN'T DARED TO RISK MYSELF IN IT
PHEW YOU DON'T SMELL
GOOD
AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED
I'M ASKING YOU QUESTIONS BUT YOU'RE PERFECTLY RIGHT NOT TO ANSWER
IT'S AN APPRENTICESHIP AGAINST THAT CURSED QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THE
EXAMINING MAGISTRATE
AND THEN WHEN YOU DON'T TALK AT ALL YOU RUN NO
RISK OF TALKING TOO LOUD
THAT'S NO MATTER AS I CAN'T SEE YOUR FACE AND
AS I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME YOU ARE WRONG IN SUPPOSING THAT I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU WANT
I TWIG
YOU'VE BROKEN UP THAT GENTLEMAN
A BIT NOW YOU WANT TO TUCK HIM AWAY SOMEWHERE
THE RIVER THAT GREAT
HIDER OF FOLLY IS WHAT YOU WANT
I'LL GET YOU OUT OF YOUR SCRAPE
HELPING A GOOD FELLOW IN A PINCH IS WHAT SUITS ME TO A HAIR
WHILE EXPRESSING HIS APPROVAL OF JEAN VALJEAN'S SILENCE HE ENDEAVORED
TO FORCE HIM TO TALK
HE JOSTLED HIS SHOULDER IN AN ATTEMPT TO CATCH A
SIGHT OF HIS PROFILE AND HE EXCLAIMED WITHOUT HOWEVER RAISING HIS
TONE
APROPOS OF THAT QUAGMIRE YOU'RE A HEARTY ANIMAL
WHY DIDN'T YOU TOSS
THE MAN IN THERE
JEAN VALJEAN PRESERVED SILENCE
THENARDIER RESUMED PUSHING THE RAG WHICH SERVED HIM AS A CRAVAT TO THE
LEVEL OF HIS ADAM'S APPLE A GESTURE WHICH COMPLETES THE CAPABLE AIR OF
A SERIOUS MAN
AFTER ALL YOU ACTED WISELY
THE WORKMEN WHEN THEY COME TO MORROW TO
STOP UP THAT HOLE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOUND THE STIFF ABANDONED THERE
AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE THREAD BY THREAD STRAW BY STRAW TO
PICK UP THE SCENT AND REACH YOU
SOME ONE HAS PASSED THROUGH THE SEWER
WHO WHERE DID HE GET OUT WAS HE SEEN TO COME OUT THE POLICE ARE FULL
OF CLEVERNESS
THE SEWER IS TREACHEROUS AND TELLS TALES OF YOU
SUCH A
FIND IS A RARITY IT ATTRACTS ATTENTION VERY FEW PEOPLE MAKE USE OF
THE SEWERS FOR THEIR AFFAIRS WHILE THE RIVER BELONGS TO EVERYBODY
THE
RIVER IS THE TRUE GRAVE
AT THE END OF A MONTH THEY FISH UP YOUR MAN
IN THE NETS AT SAINT CLOUD
WELL WHAT DOES ONE CARE FOR THAT IT'S
CARRION WHO KILLED THAT MAN PARIS
AND JUSTICE MAKES NO INQUIRIES
YOU
HAVE DONE WELL
THE MORE LOQUACIOUS THENARDIER BECAME THE MORE MUTE WAS JEAN VALJEAN
AGAIN THENARDIER SHOOK HIM BY THE SHOULDER
NOW LET'S SETTLE THIS BUSINESS
LET'S GO SHARES
YOU HAVE SEEN MY KEY
SHOW ME YOUR MONEY
THENARDIER WAS HAGGARD FIERCE SUSPICIOUS RATHER MENACING YET
AMICABLE
THERE WAS ONE SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCE THENARDIER'S MANNERS WERE NOT
SIMPLE HE HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING WHOLLY AT HIS EASE WHILE AFFECTING
AN AIR OF MYSTERY HE SPOKE LOW FROM TIME TO TIME HE LAID HIS FINGER ON
HIS MOUTH AND MUTTERED HUSH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DIVINE WHY
THERE
WAS NO ONE THERE EXCEPT THEMSELVES
JEAN VALJEAN THOUGHT THAT OTHER
RUFFIANS MIGHT POSSIBLY BE CONCEALED IN SOME NOOK NOT VERY FAR OFF AND
THAT THENARDIER DID NOT CARE TO SHARE WITH THEM
THENARDIER RESUMED
LET'S SETTLE UP
HOW MUCH DID THE STIFF HAVE IN HIS BAGS
JEAN VALJEAN SEARCHED HIS POCKETS
IT WAS HIS HABIT AS THE READER WILL REMEMBER TO ALWAYS HAVE SOME
MONEY ABOUT HIM
THE MOURNFUL LIFE OF EXPEDIENTS TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN
CONDEMNED IMPOSED THIS AS A LAW UPON HIM
ON THIS OCCASION HOWEVER
HE HAD BEEN CAUGHT UNPREPARED
WHEN DONNING HIS UNIFORM OF A NATIONAL
GUARDSMAN ON THE PRECEDING EVENING HE HAD FORGOTTEN DOLEFULLY ABSORBED
AS HE WAS TO TAKE HIS POCKET BOOK
HE HAD ONLY SOME SMALL CHANGE IN HIS
FOB
HE TURNED OUT HIS POCKET ALL SOAKED WITH OOZE AND SPREAD OUT ON
THE BANQUETTE OF THE VAULT ONE LOUIS D'OR TWO FIVE FRANC PIECES AND
FIVE OR SIX LARGE SOUS
THENARDIER THRUST OUT HIS LOWER LIP WITH A SIGNIFICANT TWIST OF THE
NECK
YOU KNOCKED HIM OVER CHEAP SAID HE
HE SET TO FEELING THE POCKETS OF JEAN VALJEAN AND MARIUS WITH THE
GREATEST FAMILIARITY
JEAN VALJEAN WHO WAS CHIEFLY CONCERNED IN KEEPING
HIS BACK TO THE LIGHT LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY
WHILE HANDLING MARIUS' COAT THENARDIER WITH THE SKILL OF A PICKPOCKET
AND WITHOUT BEING NOTICED BY JEAN VALJEAN TORE OFF A STRIP WHICH HE
CONCEALED UNDER HIS BLOUSE PROBABLY THINKING THAT THIS MORSEL OF
STUFF MIGHT SERVE LATER ON TO IDENTIFY THE ASSASSINATED MAN AND THE
ASSASSIN
HOWEVER HE FOUND NO MORE THAN THE THIRTY FRANCS
THAT'S TRUE SAID HE BOTH OF YOU TOGETHER HAVE NO MORE THAN THAT
AND FORGETTING HIS MOTTO HALF SHARES HE TOOK ALL
HE HESITATED A LITTLE OVER THE LARGE SOUS
AFTER DUE REFLECTION HE TOOK
THEM ALSO MUTTERING
NEVER MIND YOU CUT FOLKS' THROATS TOO CHEAP ALTOGETHER
THAT DONE HE ONCE MORE DREW THE BIG KEY FROM UNDER HIS BLOUSE
NOW MY FRIEND YOU MUST LEAVE
IT'S LIKE THE FAIR HERE YOU PAY WHEN
YOU GO OUT
YOU HAVE PAID NOW CLEAR OUT
AND HE BEGAN TO LAUGH
HAD HE IN LENDING TO THIS STRANGER THE AID OF HIS KEY AND IN MAKING
SOME OTHER MAN THAN HIMSELF EMERGE FROM THAT PORTAL THE PURE AND
DISINTERESTED INTENTION OF RESCUING AN ASSASSIN WE MAY BE PERMITTED TO
DOUBT THIS
THENARDIER HELPED JEAN VALJEAN TO REPLACE MARIUS ON HIS SHOULDERS THEN
HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE GRATING ON TIPTOE AND BAREFOOTED MAKING JEAN
VALJEAN A SIGN TO FOLLOW HIM LOOKED OUT LAID HIS FINGER ON HIS MOUTH
AND REMAINED FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AS THOUGH IN SUSPENSE HIS INSPECTION
FINISHED HE PLACED THE KEY IN THE LOCK
THE BOLT SLIPPED BACK AND THE
GATE SWUNG OPEN
IT NEITHER GRATED NOR SQUEAKED
IT MOVED VERY SOFTLY
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THIS GATE AND THOSE HINGES CAREFULLY OILED WERE
IN THE HABIT OF OPENING MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WAS SUPPOSED
THIS
SOFTNESS WAS SUSPICIOUS IT HINTED AT FURTIVE GOINGS AND COMINGS SILENT
ENTRANCES AND EXITS OF NOCTURNAL MEN AND THE WOLF LIKE TREAD OF CRIME
THE SEWER WAS EVIDENTLY AN ACCOMPLICE OF SOME MYSTERIOUS BAND
THIS
TACITURN GRATING WAS A RECEIVER OF STOLEN GOODS
THENARDIER OPENED THE GATE A LITTLE WAY ALLOWING JUST SUFFICIENT SPACE
FOR JEAN VALJEAN TO PASS OUT CLOSED THE GRATING AGAIN GAVE THE KEY
A DOUBLE TURN IN THE LOCK AND PLUNGED BACK INTO THE DARKNESS WITHOUT
MAKING ANY MORE NOISE THAN A BREATH
HE SEEMED TO WALK WITH THE VELVET
PAWS OF A TIGER
A MOMENT LATER THAT HIDEOUS PROVIDENCE HAD RETREATED INTO THE
INVISIBILITY
JEAN VALJEAN FOUND HIMSELF IN THE OPEN AIR
CHAPTER IX MARIUS PRODUCES ON SOME ONE WHO IS A JUDGE OF THE MATTER
THE EFFECT OF BEING DEAD
HE ALLOWED MARIUS TO SLIDE DOWN UPON THE SHORE
THEY WERE IN THE OPEN AIR
THE MIASMAS DARKNESS HORROR LAY BEHIND HIM
THE PURE HEALTHFUL
LIVING JOYOUS AIR THAT WAS EASY TO BREATHE INUNDATED HIM
EVERYWHERE
AROUND HIM REIGNED SILENCE BUT THAT CHARMING SILENCE WHEN THE SUN HAS
SET IN AN UNCLOUDED AZURE SKY
TWILIGHT HAD DESCENDED NIGHT WAS DRAWING
ON THE GREAT DELIVERER THE FRIEND OF ALL THOSE WHO NEED A MANTLE OF
DARKNESS THAT THEY MAY ESCAPE FROM AN ANGUISH
THE SKY PRESENTED ITSELF
IN ALL DIRECTIONS LIKE AN ENORMOUS CALM
THE RIVER FLOWED TO HIS FEET
WITH THE SOUND OF A KISS
THE AERIAL DIALOGUE OF THE NESTS BIDDING EACH
OTHER GOOD NIGHT IN THE ELMS OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES WAS AUDIBLE
A FEW
STARS DAINTILY PIERCING THE PALE BLUE OF THE ZENITH AND VISIBLE TO
REVERY ALONE FORMED IMPERCEPTIBLE LITTLE SPLENDORS AMID THE IMMENSITY
EVENING WAS UNFOLDING OVER THE HEAD OF JEAN VALJEAN ALL THE SWEETNESS OF
THE INFINITE
IT WAS THAT EXQUISITE AND UNDECIDED HOUR WHICH SAYS NEITHER YES NOR NO
NIGHT WAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED TO RENDER IT POSSIBLE TO LOSE
ONESELF AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AND YET THERE WAS SUFFICIENT DAYLIGHT TO
PERMIT OF RECOGNITION AT CLOSE QUARTERS
FOR SEVERAL SECONDS JEAN VALJEAN WAS IRRESISTIBLY OVERCOME BY THAT
AUGUST AND CARESSING SERENITY SUCH MOMENTS OF OBLIVION DO COME TO MEN
SUFFERING REFRAINS FROM HARASSING THE UNHAPPY WRETCH EVERYTHING IS
ECLIPSED IN THE THOUGHTS PEACE BROODS OVER THE DREAMER LIKE NIGHT AND
BENEATH THE TWILIGHT WHICH BEAMS AND IN IMITATION OF THE SKY WHICH IS
ILLUMINATED THE SOUL BECOMES STUDDED WITH STARS
JEAN VALJEAN COULD
NOT REFRAIN FROM CONTEMPLATING THAT VAST CLEAR SHADOW WHICH RESTED
OVER HIM THOUGHTFULLY HE BATHED IN THE SEA OF ECSTASY AND PRAYER IN THE
MAJESTIC SILENCE OF THE ETERNAL HEAVENS
THEN HE BENT DOWN SWIFTLY
TO MARIUS AS THOUGH THE SENTIMENT OF DUTY HAD RETURNED TO HIM AND
DIPPING UP WATER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND HE GENTLY SPRINKLED A
FEW DROPS ON THE LATTER'S FACE
MARIUS' EYELIDS DID NOT OPEN BUT HIS
HALF OPEN MOUTH STILL BREATHED
JEAN VALJEAN WAS ON THE POINT OF DIPPING HIS HAND IN THE RIVER ONCE
MORE WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE EXPERIENCED AN INDESCRIBABLE EMBARRASSMENT
SUCH AS A PERSON FEELS WHEN THERE IS SOME ONE BEHIND HIM WHOM HE DOES
NOT SEE
WE HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO THIS IMPRESSION WITH WHICH EVERYONE IS
FAMILIAR
HE TURNED ROUND
SOME ONE WAS IN FACT BEHIND HIM AS THERE HAD BEEN A SHORT WHILE
BEFORE
A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE ENVELOPED IN A LONG COAT WITH FOLDED ARMS
AND BEARING IN HIS RIGHT FIST A BLUDGEON OF WHICH THE LEADEN HEAD WAS
VISIBLE STOOD A FEW PACES IN THE REAR OF THE SPOT WHERE JEAN VALJEAN
WAS CROUCHING OVER MARIUS
WITH THE AID OF THE DARKNESS IT SEEMED A SORT OF APPARITION
AN
ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN ALARMED BECAUSE OF THE TWILIGHT A
THOUGHTFUL MAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE BLUDGEON
JEAN VALJEAN RECOGNIZED
JAVERT
THE READER HAS DIVINED NO DOUBT THAT THENARDIER'S PURSUER WAS NO OTHER
THAN JAVERT
JAVERT AFTER HIS UNLOOKED FOR ESCAPE FROM THE BARRICADE
HAD BETAKEN HIMSELF TO THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE HAD RENDERED A
VERBAL ACCOUNT TO THE PREFECT IN PERSON IN A BRIEF AUDIENCE HAD THEN
IMMEDIATELY GONE ON DUTY AGAIN WHICH IMPLIED THE NOTE THE READER WILL
RECOLLECT WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED ON HIS PERSON A CERTAIN SURVEILLANCE
OF THE SHORE ON THE RIGHT BANK OF THE SEINE NEAR THE CHAMPS ELYSEES
WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME PAST AROUSED THE ATTENTION OF THE POLICE
THERE HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THENARDIER AND HAD FOLLOWED HIM
THE READER
KNOWS THE REST
THUS IT WILL BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT GRATING SO OBLIGINGLY
OPENED TO JEAN VALJEAN WAS A BIT OF CLEVERNESS ON THENARDIER'S PART
THENARDIER INTUITIVELY FELT THAT JAVERT WAS STILL THERE THE MAN SPIED
UPON HAS A SCENT WHICH NEVER DECEIVES HIM IT WAS NECESSARY TO FLING
A BONE TO THAT SLEUTH HOUND
AN ASSASSIN WHAT A GODSEND SUCH AN
OPPORTUNITY MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO SLIP
THENARDIER BY PUTTING JEAN
VALJEAN OUTSIDE IN HIS STEAD PROVIDED A PREY FOR THE POLICE FORCED
THEM TO RELINQUISH HIS SCENT MADE THEM FORGET HIM IN A BIGGER
ADVENTURE REPAID JAVERT FOR HIS WAITING WHICH ALWAYS FLATTERS A SPY
EARNED THIRTY FRANCS AND COUNTED WITH CERTAINTY SO FAR AS HE HIMSELF
WAS CONCERNED ON ESCAPING WITH THE AID OF THIS DIVERSION
JEAN VALJEAN HAD FALLEN FROM ONE DANGER UPON ANOTHER
THESE TWO ENCOUNTERS THIS FALLING ONE AFTER THE OTHER FROM THENARDIER
UPON JAVERT WAS A RUDE SHOCK
JAVERT DID NOT RECOGNIZE JEAN VALJEAN WHO AS WE HAVE STATED NO LONGER
LOOKED LIKE HIMSELF
HE DID NOT UNFOLD HIS ARMS HE MADE SURE OF HIS
BLUDGEON IN HIS FIST BY AN IMPERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT AND SAID IN A CURT
CALM VOICE
WHO ARE YOU
I
WHO IS 'I'
JEAN VALJEAN
JAVERT THRUST HIS BLUDGEON BETWEEN HIS TEETH BENT HIS KNEES INCLINED
HIS BODY LAID HIS TWO POWERFUL HANDS ON THE SHOULDERS OF JEAN VALJEAN
WHICH WERE CLAMPED WITHIN THEM AS IN A COUPLE OF VICES SCRUTINIZED
HIM AND RECOGNIZED HIM
THEIR FACES ALMOST TOUCHED
JAVERT'S LOOK WAS
TERRIBLE
JEAN VALJEAN REMAINED INERT BENEATH JAVERT'S GRASP LIKE A LION
SUBMITTING TO THE CLAWS OF A LYNX
INSPECTOR JAVERT SAID HE YOU HAVE ME IN YOUR POWER
MOREOVER I
HAVE REGARDED MYSELF AS YOUR PRISONER EVER SINCE THIS MORNING
I DID NOT
GIVE YOU MY ADDRESS WITH ANY INTENTION OF ESCAPING FROM YOU
TAKE ME
ONLY GRANT ME ONE FAVOR
JAVERT DID NOT APPEAR TO HEAR HIM
HE KEPT HIS EYES RIVETED ON JEAN
VALJEAN
HIS CHIN BEING CONTRACTED THRUST HIS LIPS UPWARDS TOWARDS
HIS NOSE A SIGN OF SAVAGE REVERY
AT LENGTH HE RELEASED JEAN VALJEAN
STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF STIFFLY UP WITHOUT BENDING GRASPED HIS BLUDGEON
AGAIN FIRMLY AND AS THOUGH IN A DREAM HE MURMURED RATHER THAN UTTERED
THIS QUESTION
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AND WHO IS THIS MAN
HE STILL ABSTAINED FROM ADDRESSING JEAN VALJEAN AS THOU
JEAN VALJEAN REPLIED AND THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE APPEARED TO ROUSE
JAVERT
IT IS WITH REGARD TO HIM THAT I DESIRE TO SPEAK TO YOU
DISPOSE OF ME
AS YOU SEE FIT BUT FIRST HELP ME TO CARRY HIM HOME
THAT IS ALL THAT I
ASK OF YOU
JAVERT'S FACE CONTRACTED AS WAS ALWAYS THE CASE WHEN ANY ONE SEEMED TO
THINK HIM CAPABLE OF MAKING A CONCESSION
NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT SAY
NO
AGAIN HE BENT OVER DREW FROM HIS POCKET A HANDKERCHIEF WHICH
HE MOISTENED IN THE WATER AND WITH WHICH HE THEN WIPED MARIUS'
BLOOD STAINED BROW
THIS MAN WAS AT THE BARRICADE SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE AND AS THOUGH
SPEAKING TO HIMSELF
HE IS THE ONE THEY CALLED MARIUS
A SPY OF THE FIRST QUALITY WHO HAD OBSERVED EVERYTHING LISTENED TO
EVERYTHING AND TAKEN IN EVERYTHING EVEN WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS TO
DIE WHO HAD PLAYED THE SPY EVEN IN HIS AGONY AND WHO WITH HIS ELBOWS
LEANING ON THE FIRST STEP OF THE SEPULCHRE HAD TAKEN NOTES
HE SEIZED MARIUS' HAND AND FELT HIS PULSE
HE IS WOUNDED SAID JEAN VALJEAN
HE IS A DEAD MAN SAID JAVERT
JEAN VALJEAN REPLIED
NO
NOT YET
SO YOU HAVE BROUGHT HIM THITHER FROM THE BARRICADE REMARKED JAVERT
HIS PREOCCUPATION MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN VERY PROFOUND FOR HIM NOT TO
INSIST ON THIS ALARMING RESCUE THROUGH THE SEWER AND FOR HIM NOT TO
EVEN NOTICE JEAN VALJEAN'S SILENCE AFTER HIS QUESTION
JEAN VALJEAN ON HIS SIDE SEEMED TO HAVE BUT ONE THOUGHT
HE RESUMED
HE LIVES IN THE MARAIS RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE WITH HIS
GRANDFATHER
I DO NOT RECOLLECT HIS NAME
JEAN VALJEAN FUMBLED IN MARIUS' COAT PULLED OUT HIS POCKET BOOK OPENED
IT AT THE PAGE WHICH MARIUS HAD PENCILLED AND HELD IT OUT TO JAVERT
THERE WAS STILL SUFFICIENT LIGHT TO ADMIT OF READING
BESIDES THIS
JAVERT POSSESSED IN HIS EYE THE FELINE PHOSPHORESCENCE OF NIGHT
BIRDS
HE DECIPHERED THE FEW LINES WRITTEN BY MARIUS AND MUTTERED
GILLENORMAND RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE NO
6
THEN HE EXCLAIMED COACHMAN
THE READER WILL REMEMBER THAT THE HACKNEY COACH WAS WAITING IN CASE OF
NEED
JAVERT KEPT MARIUS' POCKET BOOK
A MOMENT LATER THE CARRIAGE WHICH HAD DESCENDED BY THE INCLINED PLANE
OF THE WATERING PLACE WAS ON THE SHORE
MARIUS WAS LAID UPON THE BACK
SEAT AND JAVERT SEATED HIMSELF ON THE FRONT SEAT BESIDE JEAN VALJEAN
THE DOOR SLAMMED AND THE CARRIAGE DROVE RAPIDLY AWAY ASCENDING THE
QUAYS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BASTILLE
THEY QUITTED THE QUAYS AND ENTERED THE STREETS
THE COACHMAN A BLACK
FORM ON HIS BOX WHIPPED UP HIS THIN HORSES
A GLACIAL SILENCE REIGNED
IN THE CARRIAGE
MARIUS MOTIONLESS WITH HIS BODY RESTING IN THE
CORNER AND HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST HIS ARMS HANGING HIS LEGS
STIFF SEEMED TO BE AWAITING ONLY A COFFIN JEAN VALJEAN SEEMED MADE OF
SHADOW AND JAVERT OF STONE AND IN THAT VEHICLE FULL OF NIGHT WHOSE
INTERIOR EVERY TIME THAT IT PASSED IN FRONT OF A STREET LANTERN
APPEARED TO BE TURNED LIVIDLY WAN AS BY AN INTERMITTENT FLASH OF
LIGHTNING CHANCE HAD UNITED AND SEEMED TO BE BRINGING FACE TO FACE
THE THREE FORMS OF TRAGIC IMMOBILITY THE CORPSE THE SPECTRE AND THE
STATUE
CHAPTER X RETURN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS LIFE
AT EVERY JOLT OVER THE PAVEMENT A DROP OF BLOOD TRICKLED FROM MARIUS'
HAIR
NIGHT HAD FULLY CLOSED IN WHEN THE CARRIAGE ARRIVED AT NO
6 RUE DES
FILLES DU CALVAIRE
JAVERT WAS THE FIRST TO ALIGHT HE MADE SURE WITH ONE GLANCE OF THE
NUMBER ON THE CARRIAGE GATE AND RAISING THE HEAVY KNOCKER OF BEATEN
IRON EMBELLISHED IN THE OLD STYLE WITH A MALE GOAT AND A SATYR
CONFRONTING EACH OTHER HE GAVE A VIOLENT PEAL
THE GATE OPENED A LITTLE
WAY AND JAVERT GAVE IT A PUSH
THE PORTER HALF MADE HIS APPEARANCE
YAWNING VAGUELY AWAKE AND WITH A CANDLE IN HIS HAND
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE WAS ASLEEP
PEOPLE GO TO BED BETIMES IN THE
MARAIS ESPECIALLY ON DAYS WHEN THERE IS A REVOLT
THIS GOOD OLD
QUARTER TERRIFIED AT THE REVOLUTION TAKES REFUGE IN SLUMBER AS
CHILDREN WHEN THEY HEAR THE BUGABOO COMING HIDE THEIR HEADS HASTILY
UNDER THEIR COVERLET
IN THE MEANTIME JEAN VALJEAN AND THE COACHMAN HAD TAKEN MARIUS OUT OF
THE CARRIAGE JEAN VALJEAN SUPPORTING HIM UNDER THE ARMPITS AND THE
COACHMAN UNDER THE KNEES
AS THEY THUS BORE MARIUS JEAN VALJEAN SLIPPED HIS HAND UNDER THE
LATTER'S CLOTHES WHICH WERE BROADLY RENT FELT HIS BREAST AND ASSURED
HIMSELF THAT HIS HEART WAS STILL BEATING
IT WAS EVEN BEATING A LITTLE
LESS FEEBLY AS THOUGH THE MOVEMENT OF THE CARRIAGE HAD BROUGHT ABOUT A
CERTAIN FRESH ACCESS OF LIFE
JAVERT ADDRESSED THE PORTER IN A TONE BEFITTING THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
PRESENCE OF THE PORTER OF A FACTIOUS PERSON
SOME PERSON WHOSE NAME IS GILLENORMAND
HERE
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HIM
HIS SON IS BROUGHT BACK
HIS SON SAID THE PORTER STUPIDLY
HE IS DEAD
JEAN VALJEAN WHO SOILED AND TATTERED STOOD BEHIND JAVERT AND WHOM
THE PORTER WAS SURVEYING WITH SOME HORROR MADE A SIGN TO HIM WITH HIS
HEAD THAT THIS WAS NOT SO
THE PORTER DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND EITHER JAVERT'S WORDS OR JEAN
VALJEAN'S SIGN
JAVERT CONTINUED
HE WENT TO THE BARRICADE AND HERE HE IS
TO THE BARRICADE EJACULATED THE PORTER
HE HAS GOT HIMSELF KILLED
GO WAKEN HIS FATHER
THE PORTER DID NOT STIR
GO ALONG WITH YOU REPEATED JAVERT
AND HE ADDED
THERE WILL BE A FUNERAL HERE TO MORROW
FOR JAVERT THE USUAL INCIDENTS OF THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY WERE CATEGORICALLY
CLASSED WHICH IS THE BEGINNING OF FORESIGHT AND SURVEILLANCE AND EACH
CONTINGENCY HAD ITS OWN COMPARTMENT ALL POSSIBLE FACTS WERE ARRANGED
IN DRAWERS AS IT WERE WHENCE THEY EMERGED ON OCCASION IN VARIABLE
QUANTITIES IN THE STREET UPROAR REVOLT CARNIVAL AND FUNERAL
THE PORTER CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH WAKING BASQUE
BASQUE WOKE NICOLETTE
NICOLETTE ROUSED GREAT AUNT GILLENORMAND
AS FOR THE GRANDFATHER THEY LET HIM SLEEP ON THINKING THAT HE WOULD
HEAR ABOUT THE MATTER EARLY ENOUGH IN ANY CASE
MARIUS WAS CARRIED UP TO THE FIRST FLOOR WITHOUT ANY ONE IN THE OTHER
PARTS OF THE HOUSE BEING AWARE OF THE FACT AND DEPOSITED ON AN OLD SOFA
IN M
GILLENORMAND'S ANTECHAMBER AND WHILE BASQUE WENT IN SEARCH OF A
PHYSICIAN AND WHILE NICOLETTE OPENED THE LINEN PRESSES JEAN VALJEAN
FELT JAVERT TOUCH HIM ON THE SHOULDER
HE UNDERSTOOD AND DESCENDED THE
STAIRS HAVING BEHIND HIM THE STEP OF JAVERT WHO WAS FOLLOWING HIM
THE PORTER WATCHED THEM TAKE THEIR DEPARTURE AS HE HAD WATCHED THEIR
ARRIVAL IN TERRIFIED SOMNOLENCE
THEY ENTERED THE CARRIAGE ONCE MORE AND THE COACHMAN MOUNTED HIS BOX
INSPECTOR JAVERT SAID JEAN GRANT ME YET ANOTHER FAVOR
WHAT IS IT DEMANDED JAVERT ROUGHLY
LET ME GO HOME FOR ONE INSTANT
THEN YOU SHALL DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE
WITH ME
JAVERT REMAINED SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS WITH HIS CHIN DRAWN BACK INTO
THE COLLAR OF HIS GREAT COAT THEN HE LOWERED THE GLASS AND FRONT
DRIVER SAID HE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME NO
7
CHAPTER XI CONCUSSION IN THE ABSOLUTE
THEY DID NOT OPEN THEIR LIPS AGAIN DURING THE WHOLE SPACE OF THEIR RIDE
WHAT DID JEAN VALJEAN WANT TO FINISH WHAT HE HAD BEGUN TO WARN
COSETTE TO TELL HER WHERE MARIUS WAS TO GIVE HER POSSIBLY SOME OTHER
USEFUL INFORMATION TO TAKE IF HE COULD CERTAIN FINAL MEASURES
AS
FOR HIMSELF SO FAR AS HE WAS PERSONALLY CONCERNED ALL WAS OVER HE HAD
BEEN SEIZED BY JAVERT AND HAD NOT RESISTED ANY OTHER MAN THAN HIMSELF
IN LIKE SITUATION WOULD PERHAPS HAVE HAD SOME VAGUE THOUGHTS CONNECTED
WITH THE ROPE WHICH THENARDIER HAD GIVEN HIM AND OF THE BARS OF THE
FIRST CELL THAT HE SHOULD ENTER BUT LET US IMPRESS IT UPON THE
READER AFTER THE BISHOP THERE HAD EXISTED IN JEAN VALJEAN A PROFOUND
HESITATION IN THE PRESENCE OF ANY VIOLENCE EVEN WHEN DIRECTED AGAINST
HIMSELF
SUICIDE THAT MYSTERIOUS ACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE UNKNOWN WHICH MAY
CONTAIN IN A MEASURE THE DEATH OF THE SOUL WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JEAN
VALJEAN
AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME THE CARRIAGE HALTED THE WAY
BEING TOO NARROW TO ADMIT OF THE ENTRANCE OF VEHICLES
JAVERT AND JEAN
VALJEAN ALIGHTED
THE COACHMAN HUMBLY REPRESENTED TO MONSIEUR L'INSPECTEUR THAT THE
UTRECHT VELVET OF HIS CARRIAGE WAS ALL SPOTTED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE
ASSASSINATED MAN AND WITH MIRE FROM THE ASSASSIN
THAT IS THE WAY HE
UNDERSTOOD IT
HE ADDED THAT AN INDEMNITY WAS DUE HIM
AT THE SAME TIME
DRAWING HIS CERTIFICATE BOOK FROM HIS POCKET HE BEGGED THE INSPECTOR TO
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO WRITE HIM A BIT OF AN ATTESTATION
JAVERT THRUST ASIDE THE BOOK WHICH THE COACHMAN HELD OUT TO HIM AND
SAID
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT INCLUDING YOUR TIME OF WAITING AND THE DRIVE
IT COMES TO SEVEN HOURS AND A QUARTER REPLIED THE MAN AND MY VELVET
WAS PERFECTLY NEW
EIGHTY FRANCS MR
INSPECTOR
JAVERT DREW FOUR NAPOLEONS FROM HIS POCKET AND DISMISSED THE CARRIAGE
JEAN VALJEAN FANCIED THAT IT WAS JAVERT'S INTENTION TO CONDUCT HIM ON
FOOT TO THE POST OF THE BLANCS MANTEAUX OR TO THE POST OF THE ARCHIVES
BOTH OF WHICH ARE CLOSE AT HAND
THEY ENTERED THE STREET
IT WAS DESERTED AS USUAL
JAVERT FOLLOWED JEAN
VALJEAN
THEY REACHED NO
7
JEAN VALJEAN KNOCKED
THE DOOR OPENED
IT IS WELL SAID JAVERT
GO UP STAIRS
HE ADDED WITH A STRANGE EXPRESSION AND AS THOUGH HE WERE EXERTING AN
EFFORT IN SPEAKING IN THIS MANNER
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE
JEAN VALJEAN LOOKED AT JAVERT
THIS MODE OF PROCEDURE WAS BUT LITTLE IN
ACCORD WITH JAVERT'S HABITS
HOWEVER HE COULD NOT BE GREATLY SURPRISED
THAT JAVERT SHOULD NOW HAVE A SORT OF HAUGHTY CONFIDENCE IN HIM THE
CONFIDENCE OF THE CAT WHICH GRANTS THE MOUSE LIBERTY TO THE LENGTH OF
ITS CLAWS SEEING THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SURRENDER
HIMSELF AND TO MAKE AN END OF IT
HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR ENTERED THE
HOUSE CALLED TO THE PORTER WHO WAS IN BED AND WHO HAD PULLED THE CORD
FROM HIS COUCH IT IS I AND ASCENDED THE STAIRS
ON ARRIVING AT THE FIRST FLOOR HE PAUSED
ALL SORROWFUL ROADS
HAVE THEIR STATIONS
THE WINDOW ON THE LANDING PLACE WHICH WAS A
SASH WINDOW WAS OPEN
AS IN MANY ANCIENT HOUSES THE STAIRCASE GOT ITS
LIGHT FROM WITHOUT AND HAD A VIEW ON THE STREET
THE STREET LANTERN
SITUATED DIRECTLY OPPOSITE CAST SOME LIGHT ON THE STAIRS AND THUS
EFFECTED SOME ECONOMY IN ILLUMINATION
JEAN VALJEAN EITHER FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE AIR OR MECHANICALLY
THRUST HIS HEAD OUT OF THIS WINDOW
HE LEANED OUT OVER THE STREET
IT
IS SHORT AND THE LANTERN LIGHTED IT FROM END TO END
JEAN VALJEAN WAS
OVERWHELMED WITH AMAZEMENT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ONE THERE
JAVERT HAD TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE
CHAPTER XII THE GRANDFATHER
BASQUE AND THE PORTER HAD CARRIED MARIUS INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AS HE
STILL LAY STRETCHED OUT MOTIONLESS ON THE SOFA UPON WHICH HE HAD BEEN
PLACED ON HIS ARRIVAL
THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR HAD HASTENED
THITHER
AUNT GILLENORMAND HAD RISEN
AUNT GILLENORMAND WENT AND CAME IN AFFRIGHT WRINGING HER HANDS AND
INCAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING BUT SAYING HEAVENS IS IT POSSIBLE AT
TIMES SHE ADDED EVERYTHING WILL BE COVERED WITH BLOOD WHEN HER FIRST
HORROR HAD PASSED OFF A CERTAIN PHILOSOPHY OF THE SITUATION PENETRATED
HER MIND AND TOOK FORM IN THE EXCLAMATION IT WAS BOUND TO END IN THIS
WAY SHE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS I TOLD YOU SO WHICH IS CUSTOMARY ON
THIS SORT OF OCCASION
AT THE PHYSICIAN'S ORDERS A CAMP BED HAD BEEN
PREPARED BESIDE THE SOFA
THE DOCTOR EXAMINED MARIUS AND AFTER HAVING
FOUND THAT HIS PULSE WAS STILL BEATING THAT THE WOUNDED MAN HAD NO VERY
DEEP WOUND ON HIS BREAST AND THAT THE BLOOD ON THE CORNERS OF HIS LIPS
PROCEEDED FROM HIS NOSTRILS HE HAD HIM PLACED FLAT ON THE BED WITHOUT
A PILLOW WITH HIS HEAD ON THE SAME LEVEL AS HIS BODY AND EVEN A
TRIFLE LOWER AND WITH HIS BUST BARE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE RESPIRATION
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND ON PERCEIVING THAT THEY WERE UNDRESSING
MARIUS WITHDREW
SHE SET HERSELF TO TELLING HER BEADS IN HER OWN
CHAMBER
THE TRUNK HAD NOT SUFFERED ANY INTERNAL INJURY A BULLET DEADENED BY
THE POCKET BOOK HAD TURNED ASIDE AND MADE THE TOUR OF HIS RIBS WITH A
HIDEOUS LACERATION WHICH WAS OF NO GREAT DEPTH AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT
DANGEROUS
THE LONG UNDERGROUND JOURNEY HAD COMPLETED THE DISLOCATION
OF THE BROKEN COLLAR BONE AND THE DISORDER THERE WAS SERIOUS
THE ARMS
HAD BEEN SLASHED WITH SABRE CUTS
NOT A SINGLE SCAR DISFIGURED HIS FACE
BUT HIS HEAD WAS FAIRLY COVERED WITH CUTS WHAT WOULD BE THE RESULT OF
THESE WOUNDS ON THE HEAD WOULD THEY STOP SHORT AT THE HAIRY CUTICLE OR
WOULD THEY ATTACK THE BRAIN AS YET THIS COULD NOT BE DECIDED
A GRAVE
SYMPTOM WAS THAT THEY HAD CAUSED A SWOON AND THAT PEOPLE DO NOT ALWAYS
RECOVER FROM SUCH SWOONS
MOREOVER THE WOUNDED MAN HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED
BY HEMORRHAGE
FROM THE WAIST DOWN THE BARRICADE HAD PROTECTED THE
LOWER PART OF THE BODY FROM INJURY
BASQUE AND NICOLETTE TORE UP LINEN AND PREPARED BANDAGES NICOLETTE
SEWED THEM BASQUE ROLLED THEM
AS LINT WAS LACKING THE DOCTOR FOR
THE TIME BEING ARRESTED THE BLEEDING WITH LAYERS OF WADDING
BESIDE
THE BED THREE CANDLES BURNED ON A TABLE WHERE THE CASE OF SURGICAL
INSTRUMENTS LAY SPREAD OUT
THE DOCTOR BATHED MARIUS' FACE AND HAIR WITH
COLD WATER
A FULL PAIL WAS REDDENED IN AN INSTANT
THE PORTER CANDLE
IN HAND LIGHTED THEM
THE DOCTOR SEEMED TO BE PONDERING SADLY
FROM TIME TO TIME HE MADE A
NEGATIVE SIGN WITH HIS HEAD AS THOUGH REPLYING TO SOME QUESTION WHICH
HE HAD INWARDLY ADDRESSED TO HIMSELF
A BAD SIGN FOR THE SICK MAN ARE THESE MYSTERIOUS DIALOGUES OF THE DOCTOR
WITH HIMSELF
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE DOCTOR WAS WIPING MARIUS' FACE AND LIGHTLY
TOUCHING HIS STILL CLOSED EYES WITH HIS FINGER A DOOR OPENED AT THE END
OF THE DRAWING ROOM AND A LONG PALLID FIGURE MADE ITS APPEARANCE
THIS WAS THE GRANDFATHER
THE REVOLT HAD FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS DEEPLY AGITATED ENRAGED AND
ENGROSSED THE MIND OF M
GILLENORMAND
HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP
ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND HE HAD BEEN IN A FEVER ALL DAY LONG
IN THE
EVENING HE HAD GONE TO BED VERY EARLY RECOMMENDING THAT EVERYTHING IN
THE HOUSE SHOULD BE WELL BARRED AND HE HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE THROUGH
SHEER FATIGUE
OLD MEN SLEEP LIGHTLY M
GILLENORMAND'S CHAMBER ADJOINED THE
DRAWING ROOM AND IN SPITE OF ALL THE PRECAUTIONS THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN
THE NOISE HAD AWAKENED HIM
SURPRISED AT THE RIFT OF LIGHT WHICH HE
SAW UNDER HIS DOOR HE HAD RISEN FROM HIS BED AND HAD GROPED HIS WAY
THITHER
HE STOOD ASTONISHED ON THE THRESHOLD ONE HAND ON THE HANDLE OF THE
HALF OPEN DOOR WITH HIS HEAD BENT A LITTLE FORWARD AND QUIVERING
HIS BODY WRAPPED IN A WHITE DRESSING GOWN WHICH WAS STRAIGHT AND AS
DESTITUTE OF FOLDS AS A WINDING SHEET AND HE HAD THE AIR OF A PHANTOM
WHO IS GAZING INTO A TOMB
HE SAW THE BED AND ON THE MATTRESS THAT YOUNG MAN BLEEDING WHITE WITH
A WAXEN WHITENESS WITH CLOSED EYES AND GAPING MOUTH AND PALLID LIPS
STRIPPED TO THE WAIST SLASHED ALL OVER WITH CRIMSON WOUNDS MOTIONLESS
AND BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED UP
THE GRANDFATHER TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT AS POWERFULLY AS OSSIFIED
LIMBS CAN TREMBLE HIS EYES WHOSE CORNEAE WERE YELLOW ON ACCOUNT OF
HIS GREAT AGE WERE VEILED IN A SORT OF VITREOUS GLITTER HIS WHOLE
FACE ASSUMED IN AN INSTANT THE EARTHY ANGLES OF A SKULL HIS ARMS FELL
PENDENT AS THOUGH A SPRING HAD BROKEN AND HIS AMAZEMENT WAS BETRAYED
BY THE OUTSPREADING OF THE FINGERS OF HIS TWO AGED HANDS WHICH QUIVERED
ALL OVER HIS KNEES FORMED AN ANGLE IN FRONT ALLOWING THROUGH
THE OPENING IN HIS DRESSING GOWN A VIEW OF HIS POOR BARE LEGS ALL
BRISTLING WITH WHITE HAIRS AND HE MURMURED
MARIUS
SIR SAID BASQUE MONSIEUR HAS JUST BEEN BROUGHT BACK
HE WENT TO THE
BARRICADE AND
HE IS DEAD CRIED THE OLD MAN IN A TERRIBLE VOICE
AH THE RASCAL
THEN A SORT OF SEPULCHRAL TRANSFORMATION STRAIGHTENED UP THIS
CENTENARIAN AS ERECT AS A YOUNG MAN
SIR SAID HE YOU ARE THE DOCTOR
BEGIN BY TELLING ME ONE THING
HE
IS DEAD IS HE NOT
THE DOCTOR WHO WAS AT THE HIGHEST PITCH OF ANXIETY REMAINED SILENT
M
GILLENORMAND WRUNG HIS HANDS WITH AN OUTBURST OF TERRIBLE LAUGHTER
HE IS DEAD HE IS DEAD HE IS DEAD HE HAS GOT HIMSELF KILLED ON
THE BARRICADES OUT OF HATRED TO ME HE DID THAT TO SPITE ME AH YOU
BLOOD DRINKER THIS IS THE WAY HE RETURNS TO ME MISERY OF MY LIFE HE
IS DEAD
HE WENT TO THE WINDOW THREW IT WIDE OPEN AS THOUGH HE WERE STIFLING
AND ERECT BEFORE THE DARKNESS HE BEGAN TO TALK INTO THE STREET TO THE
NIGHT
PIERCED SABRED EXTERMINATED SLASHED HACKED IN PIECES JUST LOOK AT
THAT THE VILLAIN HE KNEW WELL THAT I WAS WAITING FOR HIM AND THAT I
HAD HAD HIS ROOM ARRANGED AND THAT I HAD PLACED AT THE HEAD OF MY BED
HIS PORTRAIT TAKEN WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE CHILD HE KNEW WELL THAT HE HAD
ONLY TO COME BACK AND THAT I HAD BEEN RECALLING HIM FOR YEARS AND THAT
I REMAINED BY MY FIRESIDE WITH MY HANDS ON MY KNEES NOT KNOWING WHAT
TO DO AND THAT I WAS MAD OVER IT YOU KNEW WELL THAT YOU HAD BUT TO
RETURN AND TO SAY 'IT IS I AND YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MASTER OF THE
HOUSE AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE OBEYED YOU AND THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE
WHATEVER YOU PLEASED WITH YOUR OLD NUMSKULL OF A GRANDFATHER YOU KNEW
THAT WELL AND YOU SAID
NO HE IS A ROYALIST I WILL NOT GO AND YOU WENT TO THE BARRICADES
AND YOU GOT YOURSELF KILLED OUT OF MALICE TO REVENGE YOURSELF FOR WHAT
I SAID TO YOU ABOUT MONSIEUR LE DUC DE BERRY
IT IS INFAMOUS GO TO BED
THEN AND SLEEP TRANQUILLY HE IS DEAD AND THIS IS MY AWAKENING
THE DOCTOR WHO WAS BEGINNING TO BE UNEASY IN BOTH QUARTERS QUITTED
MARIUS FOR A MOMENT WENT TO M
GILLENORMAND AND TOOK HIS ARM
THE GRANDFATHER TURNED ROUND GAZED AT HIM WITH EYES WHICH SEEMED
EXAGGERATED IN SIZE AND BLOODSHOT AND SAID TO HIM CALMLY
I THANK YOU SIR
I AM COMPOSED I AM A MAN I WITNESSED THE DEATH OF
LOUIS XVI I KNOW HOW TO BEAR EVENTS
ONE THING IS TERRIBLE AND THAT IS
TO THINK THAT IT IS YOUR NEWSPAPERS WHICH DO ALL THE MISCHIEF
YOU WILL
HAVE SCRIBBLERS CHATTERERS LAWYERS ORATORS TRIBUNES DISCUSSIONS
PROGRESS ENLIGHTENMENT THE RIGHTS OF MAN THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS
AND THIS IS THE WAY THAT YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
AH
MARIUS IT IS ABOMINABLE KILLED DEAD BEFORE ME A BARRICADE AH THE
SCAMP DOCTOR YOU LIVE IN THIS QUARTER I BELIEVE OH I KNOW YOU WELL
I SEE YOUR CABRIOLET PASS MY WINDOW
I AM GOING TO TELL YOU
YOU ARE
WRONG TO THINK THAT I AM ANGRY
ONE DOES NOT FLY INTO A RAGE AGAINST A
DEAD MAN
THAT WOULD BE STUPID
THIS IS A CHILD WHOM I HAVE REARED
I WAS ALREADY OLD WHILE HE WAS VERY YOUNG
HE PLAYED IN THE TUILERIES
GARDEN WITH HIS LITTLE SHOVEL AND HIS LITTLE CHAIR AND IN ORDER THAT
THE INSPECTORS MIGHT NOT GRUMBLE I STOPPED UP THE HOLES THAT HE MADE IN
THE EARTH WITH HIS SHOVEL WITH MY CANE
ONE DAY HE EXCLAIMED DOWN WITH
LOUIS XVIII AND OFF HE WENT
IT WAS NO FAULT OF MINE
HE WAS ALL ROSY
AND BLOND
HIS MOTHER IS DEAD
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED THAT ALL LITTLE
CHILDREN ARE BLOND WHY IS IT SO HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF THOSE BRIGANDS
OF THE LOIRE BUT CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT OF THEIR FATHERS' CRIMES
I REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS NO HIGHER THAN THAT
HE COULD NOT MANAGE
TO PRONOUNCE HIS DS
HE HAD A WAY OF TALKING THAT WAS SO SWEET AND
INDISTINCT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS A BIRD CHIRPING
I
REMEMBER THAT ONCE IN FRONT OF THE HERCULES FARNESE PEOPLE FORMED A
CIRCLE TO ADMIRE HIM AND MARVEL AT HIM HE WAS SO HANDSOME WAS THAT
CHILD HE HAD A HEAD SUCH AS YOU SEE IN PICTURES
I TALKED IN A DEEP
VOICE AND I FRIGHTENED HIM WITH MY CANE BUT HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT IT
WAS ONLY TO MAKE HIM LAUGH
IN THE MORNING WHEN HE ENTERED MY ROOM I
GRUMBLED BUT HE WAS LIKE THE SUNLIGHT TO ME ALL THE SAME
ONE CANNOT
DEFEND ONESELF AGAINST THOSE BRATS
THEY TAKE HOLD OF YOU THEY HOLD YOU
FAST THEY NEVER LET YOU GO AGAIN
THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE NEVER WAS A
CUPID LIKE THAT CHILD
NOW WHAT CAN YOU SAY FOR YOUR LAFAYETTES YOUR
BENJAMIN CONSTANTS AND YOUR TIRECUIR DE CORCELLES WHO HAVE KILLED HIM
THIS CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO PASS IN THIS FASHION
HE APPROACHED MARIUS WHO STILL LAY LIVID AND MOTIONLESS AND TO WHOM
THE PHYSICIAN HAD RETURNED AND BEGAN ONCE MORE TO WRING HIS HANDS
THE
OLD MAN'S PALLID LIPS MOVED AS THOUGH MECHANICALLY AND PERMITTED THE
PASSAGE OF WORDS THAT WERE BARELY AUDIBLE LIKE BREATHS IN THE DEATH
AGONY
AH HEARTLESS LAD AH CLUBBIST AH WRETCH AH SEPTEMBRIST
REPROACHES IN THE LOW VOICE OF AN AGONIZING MAN ADDRESSED TO A CORPSE
LITTLE BY LITTLE AS IT IS ALWAYS INDISPENSABLE THAT INTERNAL ERUPTIONS
SHOULD COME TO THE LIGHT THE SEQUENCE OF WORDS RETURNED BUT THE
GRANDFATHER APPEARED NO LONGER TO HAVE THE STRENGTH TO UTTER THEM HIS
VOICE WAS SO WEAK AND EXTINCT THAT IT SEEMED TO COME FROM THE OTHER
SIDE OF AN ABYSS
IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME I AM GOING TO DIE TOO THAT I AM
AND
TO THINK THAT THERE IS NOT A HUSSY IN PARIS WHO WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
DELIGHTED TO MAKE THIS WRETCH HAPPY A SCAMP WHO INSTEAD OF AMUSING
HIMSELF AND ENJOYING LIFE WENT OFF TO FIGHT AND GET HIMSELF SHOT DOWN
LIKE A BRUTE AND FOR WHOM WHY FOR THE REPUBLIC INSTEAD OF GOING TO
DANCE AT THE CHAUMIERE AS IT IS THE DUTY OF YOUNG FOLKS TO DO WHAT'S
THE USE OF BEING TWENTY YEARS OLD THE REPUBLIC A CURSED PRETTY FOLLY
POOR MOTHERS BEGET FINE BOYS DO COME HE IS DEAD
THAT WILL MAKE TWO
FUNERALS UNDER THE SAME CARRIAGE GATE
SO YOU HAVE GOT YOURSELF ARRANGED
LIKE THIS FOR THE SAKE OF GENERAL LAMARQUE'S HANDSOME EYES WHAT HAD
THAT GENERAL LAMARQUE DONE TO YOU A SLASHER A CHATTER BOX TO GET
ONESELF KILLED FOR A DEAD MAN IF THAT ISN'T ENOUGH TO DRIVE ANY ONE
MAD JUST THINK OF IT AT TWENTY AND WITHOUT SO MUCH AS TURNING HIS
HEAD TO SEE WHETHER HE WAS NOT LEAVING SOMETHING BEHIND HIM THAT'S THE
WAY POOR GOOD OLD FELLOWS ARE FORCED TO DIE ALONE NOW ADAYS
PERISH
IN YOUR CORNER OWL WELL AFTER ALL SO MUCH THE BETTER THAT IS WHAT
I WAS HOPING FOR THIS WILL KILL ME ON THE SPOT
I AM TOO OLD I AM
A HUNDRED YEARS OLD I AM A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS OLD I OUGHT BY
RIGHTS TO HAVE BEEN DEAD LONG AGO
THIS BLOW PUTS AN END TO IT
SO ALL
IS OVER WHAT HAPPINESS WHAT IS THE GOOD OF MAKING HIM INHALE AMMONIA
AND ALL THAT PARCEL OF DRUGS YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TROUBLE YOU FOOL OF
A DOCTOR COME HE'S DEAD COMPLETELY DEAD
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT I
AM DEAD MYSELF TOO
HE HASN'T DONE THINGS BY HALF
YES THIS AGE IS
INFAMOUS INFAMOUS AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF YOU OF YOUR IDEAS OF
YOUR SYSTEMS OF YOUR MASTERS OF YOUR ORACLES OF YOUR DOCTORS OF YOUR
SCAPE GRACES OF WRITERS OF YOUR RASCALLY PHILOSOPHERS AND OF ALL THE
REVOLUTIONS WHICH FOR THE LAST SIXTY YEARS HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENING
THE FLOCKS OF CROWS IN THE TUILERIES BUT YOU WERE PITILESS IN GETTING
YOURSELF KILLED LIKE THIS I SHALL NOT EVEN GRIEVE OVER YOUR DEATH DO
YOU UNDERSTAND YOU ASSASSIN
AT THAT MOMENT MARIUS SLOWLY OPENED HIS EYES AND HIS GLANCE STILL
DIMMED BY LETHARGIC WONDER RESTED ON M
GILLENORMAND
MARIUS CRIED THE OLD MAN
MARIUS MY LITTLE MARIUS MY CHILD MY
WELL BELOVED SON YOU OPEN YOUR EYES YOU GAZE UPON ME YOU ARE ALIVE
THANKS
AND HE FELL FAINTING
BOOK FOURTH JAVERT DERAILED
CHAPTER I JAVERT
JAVERT PASSED SLOWLY DOWN THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME
HE WALKED WITH DROOPING HEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND
LIKEWISE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS
BACK
UP TO THAT DAY JAVERT HAD BORROWED FROM NAPOLEON'S ATTITUDES ONLY THAT
WHICH IS EXPRESSIVE OF RESOLUTION WITH ARMS FOLDED ACROSS THE CHEST
THAT WHICH IS EXPRESSIVE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE HANDS BEHIND THE
BACK HAD BEEN UNKNOWN TO HIM
NOW A CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE HIS WHOLE
PERSON SLOW AND SOMBRE WAS STAMPED WITH ANXIETY
HE PLUNGED INTO THE SILENT STREETS
NEVERTHELESS HE FOLLOWED ONE GIVEN DIRECTION
HE TOOK THE SHORTEST CUT TO THE SEINE REACHED THE QUAI DES ORMES
SKIRTED THE QUAY PASSED THE GREVE AND HALTED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM
THE POST OF THE PLACE DU CHATELET AT THE ANGLE OF THE PONT NOTRE DAME
THERE BETWEEN THE NOTRE DAME AND THE PONT AU CHANGE ON THE ONE HAND
AND THE QUAI DE LA MEGISSERIE AND THE QUAI AUX FLEURS ON THE OTHER THE
SEINE FORMS A SORT OF SQUARE LAKE TRAVERSED BY A RAPID
THIS POINT OF THE SEINE IS DREADED BY MARINERS
NOTHING IS MORE
DANGEROUS THAN THIS RAPID HEMMED IN AT THAT EPOCH AND IRRITATED BY
THE PILES OF THE MILL ON THE BRIDGE NOW DEMOLISHED
THE TWO BRIDGES
SITUATED THUS CLOSE TOGETHER AUGMENT THE PERIL THE WATER HURRIES IN
FORMIDABLE WISE THROUGH THE ARCHES
IT ROLLS IN VAST AND TERRIBLE WAVES
IT ACCUMULATES AND PILES UP THERE THE FLOOD ATTACKS THE PILES OF THE
BRIDGES AS THOUGH IN AN EFFORT TO PLUCK THEM UP WITH GREAT LIQUID ROPES
MEN WHO FALL IN THERE NEVER RE APPEAR THE BEST OF SWIMMERS ARE DROWNED
THERE
JAVERT LEANED BOTH ELBOWS ON THE PARAPET HIS CHIN RESTING IN BOTH
HANDS AND WHILE HIS NAILS WERE MECHANICALLY TWINED IN THE ABUNDANCE OF
HIS WHISKERS HE MEDITATED
A NOVELTY A REVOLUTION A CATASTROPHE HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE IN THE
DEPTHS OF HIS BEING AND HE HAD SOMETHING UPON WHICH TO EXAMINE HIMSELF
JAVERT WAS UNDERGOING HORRIBLE SUFFERING
FOR SEVERAL HOURS JAVERT HAD CEASED TO BE SIMPLE
HE WAS TROUBLED
THAT BRAIN SO LIMPID IN ITS BLINDNESS HAD LOST ITS TRANSPARENCY THAT
CRYSTAL WAS CLOUDED
JAVERT FELT DUTY DIVIDED WITHIN HIS CONSCIENCE AND
HE COULD NOT CONCEAL THE FACT FROM HIMSELF
WHEN HE HAD SO UNEXPECTEDLY
ENCOUNTERED JEAN VALJEAN ON THE BANKS OF THE SEINE THERE HAD BEEN IN
HIM SOMETHING OF THE WOLF WHICH REGAINS HIS GRIP ON HIS PREY AND OF THE
DOG WHO FINDS HIS MASTER AGAIN
HE BEHELD BEFORE HIM TWO PATHS BOTH EQUALLY STRAIGHT BUT HE BEHELD
TWO AND THAT TERRIFIED HIM HIM WHO HAD NEVER IN ALL HIS LIFE KNOWN
MORE THAN ONE STRAIGHT LINE
AND THE POIGNANT ANGUISH LAY IN THIS THAT
THE TWO PATHS WERE CONTRARY TO EACH OTHER
ONE OF THESE STRAIGHT LINES
EXCLUDED THE OTHER
WHICH OF THE TWO WAS THE TRUE ONE
HIS SITUATION WAS INDESCRIBABLE
TO OWE HIS LIFE TO A MALEFACTOR TO ACCEPT THAT DEBT AND TO REPAY IT TO
BE IN SPITE OF HIMSELF ON A LEVEL WITH A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE AND TO
REPAY HIS SERVICE WITH ANOTHER SERVICE TO ALLOW IT TO BE SAID TO HIM
GO AND TO SAY TO THE LATTER IN HIS TURN BE FREE TO SACRIFICE TO
PERSONAL MOTIVES DUTY THAT GENERAL OBLIGATION AND TO BE CONSCIOUS
IN THOSE PERSONAL MOTIVES OF SOMETHING THAT WAS ALSO GENERAL AND
PERCHANCE SUPERIOR TO BETRAY SOCIETY IN ORDER TO REMAIN TRUE TO HIS
CONSCIENCE THAT ALL THESE ABSURDITIES SHOULD BE REALIZED AND SHOULD
ACCUMULATE UPON HIM THIS WAS WHAT OVERWHELMED HIM
ONE THING HAD AMAZED HIM THIS WAS THAT JEAN VALJEAN SHOULD HAVE DONE
HIM A FAVOR AND ONE THING PETRIFIED HIM THAT HE JAVERT SHOULD HAVE
DONE JEAN VALJEAN A FAVOR
WHERE DID HE STAND HE SOUGHT TO COMPREHEND HIS POSITION AND COULD NO
LONGER FIND HIS BEARINGS
WHAT WAS HE TO DO NOW TO DELIVER UP JEAN VALJEAN WAS BAD TO LEAVE JEAN
VALJEAN AT LIBERTY WAS BAD
IN THE FIRST CASE THE MAN OF AUTHORITY FELL
LOWER THAN THE MAN OF THE GALLEYS IN THE SECOND A CONVICT ROSE ABOVE
THE LAW AND SET HIS FOOT UPON IT
IN BOTH CASES DISHONOR FOR HIM
JAVERT
THERE WAS DISGRACE IN ANY RESOLUTION AT WHICH HE MIGHT ARRIVE
DESTINY HAS SOME EXTREMITIES WHICH RISE PERPENDICULARLY FROM THE
IMPOSSIBLE AND BEYOND WHICH LIFE IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT A PRECIPICE
JAVERT HAD REACHED ONE OF THOSE EXTREMITIES
ONE OF HIS ANXIETIES CONSISTED IN BEING CONSTRAINED TO THINK
THE VERY
VIOLENCE OF ALL THESE CONFLICTING EMOTIONS FORCED HIM TO IT
THOUGHT WAS
SOMETHING TO WHICH HE WAS UNUSED AND WHICH WAS PECULIARLY PAINFUL
IN THOUGHT THERE ALWAYS EXISTS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INTERNAL REBELLION
AND IT IRRITATED HIM TO HAVE THAT WITHIN HIM
THOUGHT ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER OUTSIDE OF THE RESTRICTED CIRCLE OF HIS
FUNCTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR HIM IN ANY CASE USELESS AND A FATIGUE
THOUGHT ON THE DAY WHICH HAD JUST PASSED WAS A TORTURE
NEVERTHELESS IT
WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK INTO HIS CONSCIENCE AFTER
SUCH SHOCKS AND RENDER TO HIMSELF AN ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF
WHAT HE HAD JUST DONE MADE HIM SHUDDER
HE JAVERT HAD SEEN FIT TO
DECIDE CONTRARY TO ALL THE REGULATIONS OF THE POLICE CONTRARY TO THE
WHOLE SOCIAL AND JUDICIAL ORGANIZATION CONTRARY TO THE ENTIRE CODE
UPON A RELEASE THIS HAD SUITED HIM HE HAD SUBSTITUTED HIS OWN AFFAIRS
FOR THE AFFAIRS OF THE PUBLIC WAS NOT THIS UNJUSTIFIABLE EVERY TIME
THAT HE BROUGHT HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH THIS DEED WITHOUT A NAME WHICH
HE HAD COMMITTED HE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT
UPON WHAT SHOULD HE
DECIDE ONE SOLE RESOURCE REMAINED TO HIM TO RETURN IN ALL HASTE TO
THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME AND COMMIT JEAN VALJEAN TO PRISON
IT WAS CLEAR
THAT THAT WAS WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO
HE COULD NOT
SOMETHING BARRED HIS WAY IN THAT DIRECTION
SOMETHING WHAT IS THERE IN THE WORLD ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THE
TRIBUNALS EXECUTORY SENTENCES THE POLICE AND THE AUTHORITIES JAVERT
WAS OVERWHELMED
A GALLEY SLAVE SACRED A CONVICT WHO COULD NOT BE TOUCHED BY THE LAW
AND THAT THE DEED OF JAVERT
WAS IT NOT A FEARFUL THING THAT JAVERT AND JEAN VALJEAN THE MAN MADE TO
PROCEED WITH VIGOR THE MAN MADE TO SUBMIT THAT THESE TWO MEN WHO WERE
BOTH THE THINGS OF THE LAW SHOULD HAVE COME TO SUCH A PASS THAT BOTH
OF THEM HAD SET THEMSELVES ABOVE THE LAW WHAT THEN SUCH ENORMITIES
WERE TO HAPPEN AND NO ONE WAS TO BE PUNISHED JEAN VALJEAN STRONGER
THAN THE WHOLE SOCIAL ORDER WAS TO REMAIN AT LIBERTY AND HE JAVERT
WAS TO GO ON EATING THE GOVERNMENT'S BREAD
HIS REVERY GRADUALLY BECAME TERRIBLE
HE MIGHT ATHWART THIS REVERY HAVE ALSO REPROACHED HIMSELF ON
THE SUBJECT OF THAT INSURGENT WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN TO THE RUE DES
FILLES DU CALVAIRE BUT HE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT
THE LESSER FAULT
WAS LOST IN THE GREATER
BESIDES THAT INSURGENT WAS OBVIOUSLY A DEAD
MAN AND LEGALLY DEATH PUTS AN END TO PURSUIT
JEAN VALJEAN WAS THE LOAD WHICH WEIGHED UPON HIS SPIRIT
JEAN VALJEAN DISCONCERTED HIM
ALL THE AXIOMS WHICH HAD SERVED HIM AS
POINTS OF SUPPORT ALL HIS LIFE LONG HAD CRUMBLED AWAY IN THE PRESENCE
OF THIS MAN
JEAN VALJEAN'S GENEROSITY TOWARDS HIM JAVERT CRUSHED HIM
OTHER FACTS WHICH HE NOW RECALLED AND WHICH HE HAD FORMERLY TREATED
AS LIES AND FOLLY NOW RECURRED TO HIM AS REALITIES
M
MADELEINE
RE APPEARED BEHIND JEAN VALJEAN AND THE TWO FIGURES WERE SUPERPOSED IN
SUCH FASHION THAT THEY NOW FORMED BUT ONE WHICH WAS VENERABLE
JAVERT
FELT THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE WAS PENETRATING HIS SOUL ADMIRATION FOR
A CONVICT
RESPECT FOR A GALLEY SLAVE IS THAT A POSSIBLE THING HE
SHUDDERED AT IT YET COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM IT
IN VAIN DID HE STRUGGLE
HE WAS REDUCED TO CONFESS IN HIS INMOST HEART THE SUBLIMITY OF THAT
WRETCH
THIS WAS ODIOUS
A BENEVOLENT MALEFACTOR MERCIFUL GENTLE HELPFUL CLEMENT A CONVICT
RETURNING GOOD FOR EVIL GIVING BACK PARDON FOR HATRED PREFERRING PITY
TO VENGEANCE PREFERRING TO RUIN HIMSELF RATHER THAN TO RUIN HIS ENEMY
SAVING HIM WHO HAD SMITTEN HIM KNEELING ON THE HEIGHTS OF VIRTUE MORE
NEARLY AKIN TO AN ANGEL THAN TO A MAN
JAVERT WAS CONSTRAINED TO ADMIT
TO HIMSELF THAT THIS MONSTER EXISTED
THINGS COULD NOT GO ON IN THIS MANNER
CERTAINLY AND WE INSIST UPON THIS POINT HE HAD NOT YIELDED WITHOUT
RESISTANCE TO THAT MONSTER TO THAT INFAMOUS ANGEL TO THAT HIDEOUS
HERO WHO ENRAGED ALMOST AS MUCH AS HE AMAZED HIM
TWENTY TIMES AS HE
SAT IN THAT CARRIAGE FACE TO FACE WITH JEAN VALJEAN THE LEGAL TIGER HAD
ROARED WITHIN HIM
A SCORE OF TIMES HE HAD BEEN TEMPTED TO FLING HIMSELF
UPON JEAN VALJEAN TO SEIZE HIM AND DEVOUR HIM THAT IS TO SAY TO
ARREST HIM
WHAT MORE SIMPLE IN FACT TO CRY OUT AT THE FIRST POST THAT
THEY PASSED HERE IS A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE WHO HAS BROKEN HIS BAN
TO SUMMON THE GENDARMES AND SAY TO THEM THIS MAN IS YOURS THEN TO
GO OFF LEAVING THAT CONDEMNED MAN THERE TO IGNORE THE REST AND NOT TO
MEDDLE FURTHER IN THE MATTER
THIS MAN IS FOREVER A PRISONER OF THE LAW
THE LAW MAY DO WITH HIM WHAT IT WILL
WHAT COULD BE MORE JUST JAVERT
HAD SAID ALL THIS TO HIMSELF HE HAD WISHED TO PASS BEYOND TO ACT TO
APPREHEND THE MAN AND THEN AS AT PRESENT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO
IT AND EVERY TIME THAT HIS ARM HAD BEEN RAISED CONVULSIVELY TOWARDS
JEAN VALJEAN'S COLLAR HIS HAND HAD FALLEN BACK AGAIN AS BENEATH AN
ENORMOUS WEIGHT AND IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS THOUGHT HE HAD HEARD A VOICE
A STRANGE VOICE CRYING TO HIM IT IS WELL
DELIVER UP YOUR SAVIOR
THEN HAVE THE BASIN OF PONTIUS PILATE BROUGHT AND WASH YOUR CLAWS
THEN HIS REFLECTIONS REVERTED TO HIMSELF AND BESIDE JEAN VALJEAN
GLORIFIED HE BEHELD HIMSELF JAVERT DEGRADED
A CONVICT WAS HIS BENEFACTOR
BUT THEN WHY HAD HE PERMITTED THAT MAN TO LEAVE HIM ALIVE HE HAD
THE RIGHT TO BE KILLED IN THAT BARRICADE
HE SHOULD HAVE ASSERTED THAT
RIGHT
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO SUMMON THE OTHER INSURGENTS TO HIS
SUCCOR AGAINST JEAN VALJEAN TO GET HIMSELF SHOT BY FORCE
HIS SUPREME ANGUISH WAS THE LOSS OF CERTAINTY
HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN
UPROOTED
THE CODE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE THAN A STUMP IN HIS HAND
HE HAD TO DEAL WITH SCRUPLES OF AN UNKNOWN SPECIES
THERE HAD TAKEN
PLACE WITHIN HIM A SENTIMENTAL REVELATION ENTIRELY DISTINCT FROM LEGAL
AFFIRMATION HIS ONLY STANDARD OF MEASUREMENT HITHERTO
TO REMAIN IN HIS
FORMER UPRIGHTNESS DID NOT SUFFICE
A WHOLE ORDER OF UNEXPECTED FACTS
HAD CROPPED UP AND SUBJUGATED HIM
A WHOLE NEW WORLD WAS DAWNING ON
HIS SOUL KINDNESS ACCEPTED AND REPAID DEVOTION MERCY INDULGENCE
VIOLENCES COMMITTED BY PITY ON AUSTERITY RESPECT FOR PERSONS NO MORE
DEFINITIVE CONDEMNATION NO MORE CONVICTION THE POSSIBILITY OF A TEAR
IN THE EYE OF THE LAW NO ONE KNOWS WHAT JUSTICE ACCORDING TO GOD
RUNNING IN INVERSE SENSE TO JUSTICE ACCORDING TO MEN
HE PERCEIVED AMID
THE SHADOWS THE TERRIBLE RISING OF AN UNKNOWN MORAL SUN IT HORRIFIED
AND DAZZLED HIM
AN OWL FORCED TO THE GAZE OF AN EAGLE
HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS TRUE THAT THERE WERE EXCEPTIONAL CASES
THAT AUTHORITY MIGHT BE PUT OUT OF COUNTENANCE THAT THE RULE MIGHT
BE INADEQUATE IN THE PRESENCE OF A FACT THAT EVERYTHING COULD NOT
BE FRAMED WITHIN THE TEXT OF THE CODE THAT THE UNFORESEEN COMPELLED
OBEDIENCE THAT THE VIRTUE OF A CONVICT MIGHT SET A SNARE FOR THE VIRTUE
OF THE FUNCTIONARY THAT DESTINY DID INDULGE IN SUCH AMBUSHES AND
HE REFLECTED WITH DESPAIR THAT HE HIMSELF HAD NOT EVEN BEEN FORTIFIED
AGAINST A SURPRISE
HE WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GOODNESS DID EXIST
THIS CONVICT HAD
BEEN GOOD
AND HE HIMSELF UNPRECEDENTED CIRCUMSTANCE HAD JUST BEEN
GOOD ALSO
SO HE WAS BECOMING DEPRAVED
HE FOUND THAT HE WAS A COWARD
HE CONCEIVED A HORROR OF HIMSELF
JAVERT'S IDEAL WAS NOT TO BE HUMAN TO BE GRAND TO BE SUBLIME IT WAS
TO BE IRREPROACHABLE
NOW HE HAD JUST FAILED IN THIS
HOW HAD HE COME TO SUCH A PASS HOW HAD ALL THIS HAPPENED HE COULD NOT
HAVE TOLD HIMSELF
HE CLASPED HIS HEAD IN BOTH HANDS BUT IN SPITE OF
ALL THAT HE COULD DO HE COULD NOT CONTRIVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIMSELF
HE HAD CERTAINLY ALWAYS ENTERTAINED THE INTENTION OF RESTORING JEAN
VALJEAN TO THE LAW OF WHICH JEAN VALJEAN WAS THE CAPTIVE AND OF WHICH
HE JAVERT WAS THE SLAVE
NOT FOR A SINGLE INSTANT WHILE HE HELD HIM
IN HIS GRASP HAD HE CONFESSED TO HIMSELF THAT HE ENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF
RELEASING HIM
IT WAS IN SOME SORT WITHOUT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HIS
HAND HAD RELAXED AND HAD LET HIM GO FREE
ALL SORTS OF INTERROGATION POINTS FLASHED BEFORE HIS EYES
HE PUT
QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF AND MADE REPLIES TO HIMSELF AND HIS REPLIES
FRIGHTENED HIM
HE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT HAS THAT CONVICT DONE THAT
DESPERATE FELLOW WHOM I HAVE PURSUED EVEN TO PERSECUTION AND WHO HAS
HAD ME UNDER HIS FOOT AND WHO COULD HAVE AVENGED HIMSELF AND WHO
OWED IT BOTH TO HIS RANCOR AND TO HIS SAFETY IN LEAVING ME MY LIFE IN
SHOWING MERCY UPON ME HIS DUTY NO
SOMETHING MORE
AND I IN SHOWING
MERCY UPON HIM IN MY TURN WHAT HAVE I DONE MY DUTY NO
SOMETHING
MORE
SO THERE IS SOMETHING BEYOND DUTY HERE HE TOOK FRIGHT HIS
BALANCE BECAME DISJOINTED ONE OF THE SCALES FELL INTO THE ABYSS THE
OTHER ROSE HEAVENWARD AND JAVERT WAS NO LESS TERRIFIED BY THE ONE WHICH
WAS ON HIGH THAN BY THE ONE WHICH WAS BELOW
WITHOUT BEING IN THE LEAST
IN THE WORLD WHAT IS CALLED VOLTAIRIAN OR A PHILOSOPHER OR INCREDULOUS
BEING ON THE CONTRARY RESPECTFUL BY INSTINCT TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHED
CHURCH HE KNEW IT ONLY AS AN AUGUST FRAGMENT OF THE SOCIAL WHOLE ORDER
WAS HIS DOGMA AND SUFFICED FOR HIM EVER SINCE HE HAD ATTAINED TO MAN'S
ESTATE AND THE RANK OF A FUNCTIONARY HE HAD CENTRED NEARLY ALL HIS
RELIGION IN THE POLICE
BEING AND HERE WE EMPLOY WORDS WITHOUT THE
LEAST IRONY AND IN THEIR MOST SERIOUS ACCEPTATION BEING AS WE HAVE
SAID A SPY AS OTHER MEN ARE PRIESTS
HE HAD A SUPERIOR M
GISQUET UP
TO THAT DAY HE HAD NEVER DREAMED OF THAT OTHER SUPERIOR GOD
THIS NEW CHIEF GOD HE BECAME UNEXPECTEDLY CONSCIOUS OF AND HE FELT
EMBARRASSED BY HIM
THIS UNFORESEEN PRESENCE THREW HIM OFF HIS BEARINGS
HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS SUPERIOR HE WHO WAS NOT IGNORANT
OF THE FACT THAT THE SUBORDINATE IS BOUND ALWAYS TO BOW THAT HE MUST
NOT DISOBEY NOR FIND FAULT NOR DISCUSS AND THAT IN THE PRESENCE OF A
SUPERIOR WHO AMAZES HIM TOO GREATLY THE INFERIOR HAS NO OTHER RESOURCE
THAN THAT OF HANDING IN HIS RESIGNATION
BUT HOW WAS HE TO SET ABOUT HANDING IN HIS RESIGNATION TO GOD
HOWEVER THINGS MIGHT STAND AND IT WAS TO THIS POINT THAT HE REVERTED
CONSTANTLY ONE FACT DOMINATED EVERYTHING ELSE FOR HIM AND THAT WAS
THAT HE HAD JUST COMMITTED A TERRIBLE INFRACTION OF THE LAW
HE HAD JUST
SHUT HIS EYES ON AN ESCAPED CONVICT WHO HAD BROKEN HIS BAN
HE HAD JUST
SET A GALLEY SLAVE AT LARGE
HE HAD JUST ROBBED THE LAWS OF A MAN WHO
BELONGED TO THEM
THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD DONE
HE NO LONGER UNDERSTOOD
HIMSELF
THE VERY REASONS FOR HIS ACTION ESCAPED HIM ONLY THEIR VERTIGO
WAS LEFT WITH HIM
UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD LIVED WITH THAT BLIND FAITH
WHICH GLOOMY PROBITY ENGENDERS
THIS FAITH HAD QUITTED HIM THIS PROBITY
HAD DESERTED HIM
ALL THAT HE HAD BELIEVED IN MELTED AWAY
TRUTHS WHICH
HE DID NOT WISH TO RECOGNIZE WERE BESIEGING HIM INEXORABLY
HENCEFORTH
HE MUST BE A DIFFERENT MAN
HE WAS SUFFERING FROM THE STRANGE PAINS OF
A CONSCIENCE ABRUPTLY OPERATED ON FOR THE CATARACT
HE SAW THAT WHICH
IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIM TO BEHOLD
HE FELT HIMSELF EMPTIED USELESS PUT
OUT OF JOINT WITH HIS PAST LIFE TURNED OUT DISSOLVED
AUTHORITY WAS
DEAD WITHIN HIM
HE HAD NO LONGER ANY REASON FOR EXISTING
A TERRIBLE SITUATION TO BE TOUCHED
TO BE GRANITE AND TO DOUBT TO BE THE STATUE OF CHASTISEMENT CAST IN ONE
PIECE IN THE MOULD OF THE LAW AND SUDDENLY TO BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT
THAT ONE CHERISHES BENEATH ONE'S BREAST OF BRONZE SOMETHING ABSURD
AND DISOBEDIENT WHICH ALMOST RESEMBLES A HEART TO COME TO THE PASS OF
RETURNING GOOD FOR GOOD ALTHOUGH ONE HAS SAID TO ONESELF UP TO THAT DAY
THAT THAT GOOD IS EVIL TO BE THE WATCH DOG AND TO LICK THE INTRUDER'S
HAND TO BE ICE AND MELT TO BE THE PINCERS AND TO TURN INTO A HAND
TO SUDDENLY FEEL ONE'S FINGERS OPENING TO RELAX ONE'S GRIP WHAT A
TERRIBLE THING
THE MAN PROJECTILE NO LONGER ACQUAINTED WITH HIS ROUTE AND RETREATING
TO BE OBLIGED TO CONFESS THIS TO ONESELF INFALLIBILITY IS NOT
INFALLIBLE THERE MAY EXIST ERROR IN THE DOGMA ALL HAS NOT BEEN SAID
WHEN A CODE SPEAKS SOCIETY IS NOT PERFECT AUTHORITY IS COMPLICATED
WITH VACILLATION A CRACK IS POSSIBLE IN THE IMMUTABLE JUDGES ARE BUT
MEN THE LAW MAY ERR TRIBUNALS MAY MAKE A MISTAKE TO BEHOLD A RIFT IN
THE IMMENSE BLUE PANE OF THE FIRMAMENT
THAT WHICH WAS PASSING IN JAVERT WAS THE FAMPOUX OF A RECTILINEAR
CONSCIENCE THE DERAILMENT OF A SOUL THE CRUSHING OF A PROBITY WHICH
HAD BEEN IRRESISTIBLY LAUNCHED IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND WAS BREAKING
AGAINST GOD
IT CERTAINLY WAS SINGULAR THAT THE STOKER OF ORDER THAT
THE ENGINEER OF AUTHORITY MOUNTED ON THE BLIND IRON HORSE WITH ITS
RIGID ROAD COULD BE UNSEATED BY A FLASH OF LIGHT THAT THE IMMOVABLE
THE DIRECT THE CORRECT THE GEOMETRICAL THE PASSIVE THE PERFECT
COULD BEND THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST FOR THE LOCOMOTIVE A ROAD TO
DAMASCUS
GOD ALWAYS WITHIN MAN AND REFRACTORY HE THE TRUE CONSCIENCE TO THE
FALSE A PROHIBITION TO THE SPARK TO DIE OUT AN ORDER TO THE RAY TO
REMEMBER THE SUN AN INJUNCTION TO THE SOUL TO RECOGNIZE THE VERITABLE
ABSOLUTE WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE FICTITIOUS ABSOLUTE HUMANITY
WHICH CANNOT BE LOST THE HUMAN HEART INDESTRUCTIBLE THAT SPLENDID
PHENOMENON THE FINEST PERHAPS OF ALL OUR INTERIOR MARVELS DID JAVERT
UNDERSTAND THIS DID JAVERT PENETRATE IT DID JAVERT ACCOUNT FOR IT
TO HIMSELF EVIDENTLY HE DID NOT
BUT BENEATH THE PRESSURE OF THAT
INCONTESTABLE INCOMPREHENSIBILITY HE FELT HIS BRAIN BURSTING
HE WAS LESS THE MAN TRANSFIGURED THAN THE VICTIM OF THIS PRODIGY
IN ALL
THIS HE PERCEIVED ONLY THE TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTY OF EXISTENCE
IT SEEMED
TO HIM THAT HENCEFORTH HIS RESPIRATION WAS REPRESSED FOREVER
HE WAS
NOT ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING SOMETHING UNKNOWN HANGING OVER HIS HEAD
UP TO THIS POINT EVERYTHING ABOVE HIM HAD BEEN TO HIS GAZE MERELY A
SMOOTH LIMPID AND SIMPLE SURFACE THERE WAS NOTHING INCOMPREHENSIBLE
NOTHING OBSCURE NOTHING THAT WAS NOT DEFINED REGULARLY DISPOSED
LINKED PRECISE CIRCUMSCRIBED EXACT LIMITED CLOSED FULLY PROVIDED
FOR AUTHORITY WAS A PLANE SURFACE THERE WAS NO FALL IN IT NO
DIZZINESS IN ITS PRESENCE
JAVERT HAD NEVER BEHELD THE UNKNOWN EXCEPT
FROM BELOW
THE IRREGULAR THE UNFORESEEN THE DISORDERED OPENING OF
CHAOS THE POSSIBLE SLIP OVER A PRECIPICE THIS WAS THE WORK OF THE
LOWER REGIONS OF REBELS OF THE WICKED OF WRETCHES
NOW JAVERT THREW
HIMSELF BACK AND HE WAS SUDDENLY TERRIFIED BY THIS UNPRECEDENTED
APPARITION A GULF ON HIGH
WHAT ONE WAS DISMANTLED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM ONE WAS DISCONCERTED
ABSOLUTELY IN WHAT COULD ONE TRUST THAT WHICH HAD BEEN AGREED UPON WAS
GIVING WAY WHAT THE DEFECT IN SOCIETY'S ARMOR COULD BE DISCOVERED BY
A MAGNANIMOUS WRETCH WHAT AN HONEST SERVITOR OF THE LAW COULD SUDDENLY
FIND HIMSELF CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO CRIMES THE CRIME OF ALLOWING A MAN TO
ESCAPE AND THE CRIME OF ARRESTING HIM EVERYTHING WAS NOT SETTLED IN
THE ORDERS GIVEN BY THE STATE TO THE FUNCTIONARY THERE MIGHT BE
BLIND ALLEYS IN DUTY WHAT ALL THIS WAS REAL WAS IT TRUE THAT AN
EX RUFFIAN WEIGHED DOWN WITH CONVICTIONS COULD RISE ERECT AND END BY
BEING IN THE RIGHT WAS THIS CREDIBLE WERE THERE CASES IN WHICH THE LAW
SHOULD RETIRE BEFORE TRANSFIGURED CRIME AND STAMMER ITS EXCUSES YES
THAT WAS THE STATE OF THE CASE AND JAVERT SAW IT AND JAVERT HAD
TOUCHED IT AND NOT ONLY COULD HE NOT DENY IT BUT HE HAD TAKEN PART
IN IT
THESE WERE REALITIES
IT WAS ABOMINABLE THAT ACTUAL FACTS COULD
REACH SUCH DEFORMITY
IF FACTS DID THEIR DUTY THEY WOULD CONFINE
THEMSELVES TO BEING PROOFS OF THE LAW FACTS IT IS GOD WHO SENDS THEM
WAS ANARCHY THEN ON THE POINT OF NOW DESCENDING FROM ON HIGH
THUS AND IN THE EXAGGERATION OF ANGUISH AND THE OPTICAL ILLUSION
OF CONSTERNATION ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE CORRECTED AND RESTRAINED THIS
IMPRESSION WAS EFFACED AND SOCIETY AND THE HUMAN RACE AND THE
UNIVERSE WERE HENCEFORTH SUMMED UP IN HIS EYES IN ONE SIMPLE AND
TERRIBLE FEATURE THUS THE PENAL LAWS THE THING JUDGED THE FORCE DUE
TO LEGISLATION THE DECREES OF THE SOVEREIGN COURTS THE MAGISTRACY
THE GOVERNMENT PREVENTION REPRESSION OFFICIAL CRUELTY WISDOM LEGAL
INFALLIBILITY THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY ALL THE DOGMAS ON WHICH REST
POLITICAL AND CIVIL SECURITY SOVEREIGNTY JUSTICE PUBLIC TRUTH ALL
THIS WAS RUBBISH A SHAPELESS MASS CHAOS HE HIMSELF JAVERT THE SPY
OF ORDER INCORRUPTIBILITY IN THE SERVICE OF THE POLICE THE BULL DOG
PROVIDENCE OF SOCIETY VANQUISHED AND HURLED TO EARTH AND ERECT AT
THE SUMMIT OF ALL THAT RUIN A MAN WITH A GREEN CAP ON HIS HEAD AND A
HALO ROUND HIS BROW THIS WAS THE ASTOUNDING CONFUSION TO WHICH HE HAD
COME THIS WAS THE FEARFUL VISION WHICH HE BORE WITHIN HIS SOUL
WAS THIS TO BE ENDURED NO
A VIOLENT STATE IF EVER SUCH EXISTED
THERE WERE ONLY TWO WAYS OF
ESCAPING FROM IT
ONE WAS TO GO RESOLUTELY TO JEAN VALJEAN AND RESTORE
TO HIS CELL THE CONVICT FROM THE GALLEYS
THE OTHER
JAVERT QUITTED THE PARAPET AND WITH HEAD ERECT THIS TIME BETOOK
HIMSELF WITH A FIRM TREAD TOWARDS THE STATION HOUSE INDICATED BY A
LANTERN AT ONE OF THE CORNERS OF THE PLACE DU CHATELET
ON ARRIVING THERE HE SAW THROUGH THE WINDOW A SERGEANT OF POLICE AND
HE ENTERED
POLICEMEN RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER BY THE VERY WAY IN WHICH THEY
OPEN THE DOOR OF A STATION HOUSE
JAVERT MENTIONED HIS NAME SHOWED HIS
CARD TO THE SERGEANT AND SEATED HIMSELF AT THE TABLE OF THE POST ON
WHICH A CANDLE WAS BURNING
ON A TABLE LAY A PEN A LEADEN INKSTAND AND
PAPER PROVIDED IN THE EVENT OF POSSIBLE REPORTS AND THE ORDERS OF THE
NIGHT PATROLS
THIS TABLE STILL COMPLETED BY ITS STRAW SEATED CHAIR
IS AN INSTITUTION IT EXISTS IN ALL POLICE STATIONS IT IS INVARIABLY
ORNAMENTED WITH A BOX WOOD SAUCER FILLED WITH SAWDUST AND A WAFER BOX
OF CARDBOARD FILLED WITH RED WAFERS AND IT FORMS THE LOWEST STAGE OF
OFFICIAL STYLE
IT IS THERE THAT THE LITERATURE OF THE STATE HAS ITS
BEGINNING
JAVERT TOOK A PEN AND A SHEET OF PAPER AND BEGAN TO WRITE
THIS IS WHAT
HE WROTE
A FEW OBSERVATIONS FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE
IN THE FIRST PLACE I BEG MONSIEUR LE PREFET TO CAST HIS EYES
ON THIS
SECONDLY PRISONERS ON ARRIVING AFTER EXAMINATION TAKE OFF
THEIR SHOES AND STAND BAREFOOT ON THE FLAGSTONES WHILE THEY ARE
BEING SEARCHED
MANY OF THEM COUGH ON THEIR RETURN TO PRISON
THIS ENTAILS HOSPITAL EXPENSES
THIRDLY THE MODE OF KEEPING TRACK OF A MAN WITH RELAYS OF POLICE
AGENTS FROM DISTANCE TO DISTANCE IS GOOD BUT ON IMPORTANT OCCASIONS
IT IS REQUISITE THAT AT LEAST TWO AGENTS SHOULD NEVER LOSE SIGHT
OF EACH OTHER SO THAT IN CASE ONE AGENT SHOULD FOR ANY CAUSE
GROW WEAK IN HIS SERVICE THE OTHER MAY SUPERVISE HIM AND TAKE
HIS PLACE
FOURTHLY IT IS INEXPLICABLE WHY THE SPECIAL REGULATION OF THE PRISON
OF THE MADELONETTES INTERDICTS THE PRISONER FROM HAVING A CHAIR
EVEN BY PAYING FOR IT
FIFTHLY IN THE MADELONETTES THERE ARE ONLY TWO BARS TO THE CANTEEN
SO THAT THE CANTEEN WOMAN CAN TOUCH THE PRISONERS WITH HER HAND
SIXTHLY THE PRISONERS CALLED BARKERS WHO SUMMON THE OTHER
PRISONERS TO THE PARLOR FORCE THE PRISONER TO PAY THEM TWO SOUS
TO CALL HIS NAME DISTINCTLY
THIS IS A THEFT
SEVENTHLY FOR A BROKEN THREAD TEN SOUS ARE WITHHELD IN THE
WEAVING SHOP THIS IS AN ABUSE OF THE CONTRACTOR SINCE THE CLOTH
IS NONE THE WORSE FOR IT
EIGHTHLY IT IS ANNOYING FOR VISITORS TO LA FORCE TO BE
OBLIGED TO TRAVERSE THE BOYS' COURT IN ORDER TO REACH THE PARLOR
OF SAINTE MARIE L'EGYPTIENNE
NINTHLY IT IS A FACT THAT ANY DAY GENDARMES CAN BE OVERHEARD
RELATING IN THE COURT YARD OF THE PREFECTURE THE INTERROGATIONS PUT
BY THE MAGISTRATES TO PRISONERS
FOR A GENDARME WHO SHOULD BE
SWORN TO SECRECY TO REPEAT WHAT HE HAS HEARD IN THE EXAMINATION
ROOM IS A GRAVE DISORDER
TENTHLY MME
HENRY IS AN HONEST WOMAN HER CANTEEN IS VERY NEAT
BUT IT IS BAD TO HAVE A WOMAN KEEP THE WICKET TO THE MOUSE TRAP
OF THE SECRET CELLS
THIS IS UNWORTHY OF THE CONCIERGERIE OF A
GREAT CIVILIZATION
JAVERT WROTE THESE LINES IN HIS CALMEST AND MOST CORRECT CHIROGRAPHY
NOT OMITTING A SINGLE COMMA AND MAKING THE PAPER SCREECH UNDER HIS PEN
BELOW THE LAST LINE HE SIGNED
JAVERT
INSPECTOR OF THE 1ST CLASS
THE POST OF THE PLACE DU CHATELET
JUNE 7TH 1832 ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
JAVERT DRIED THE FRESH INK ON THE PAPER FOLDED IT LIKE A LETTER SEALED
IT WROTE ON THE BACK NOTE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION LEFT IT ON THE
TABLE AND QUITTED THE POST
THE GLAZED AND GRATED DOOR FELL TO BEHIND
HIM
AGAIN HE TRAVERSED THE PLACE DU CHATELET DIAGONALLY REGAINED THE QUAY
AND RETURNED WITH AUTOMATIC PRECISION TO THE VERY POINT WHICH HE HAD
ABANDONED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY LEANED ON HIS ELBOWS AND
FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN IN THE SAME ATTITUDE ON THE SAME PAVING STONE OF THE
PARAPET
HE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE STIRRED
THE DARKNESS WAS COMPLETE
IT WAS THE SEPULCHRAL MOMENT WHICH FOLLOWS
MIDNIGHT
A CEILING OF CLOUDS CONCEALED THE STARS
NOT A SINGLE LIGHT
BURNED IN THE HOUSES OF THE CITY NO ONE WAS PASSING ALL OF THE STREETS
AND QUAYS WHICH COULD BE SEEN WERE DESERTED NOTRE DAME AND THE TOWERS
OF THE COURT HOUSE SEEMED FEATURES OF THE NIGHT
A STREET LANTERN
REDDENED THE MARGIN OF THE QUAY
THE OUTLINES OF THE BRIDGES LAY
SHAPELESS IN THE MIST ONE BEHIND THE OTHER
RECENT RAINS HAD SWOLLEN THE
RIVER
THE SPOT WHERE JAVERT WAS LEANING WAS IT WILL BE REMEMBERED SITUATED
PRECISELY OVER THE RAPIDS OF THE SEINE PERPENDICULARLY ABOVE THAT
FORMIDABLE SPIRAL OF WHIRLPOOLS WHICH LOOSE AND KNOT THEMSELVES AGAIN
LIKE AN ENDLESS SCREW
JAVERT BENT HIS HEAD AND GAZED
ALL WAS BLACK
NOTHING WAS TO BE
DISTINGUISHED
A SOUND OF FOAM WAS AUDIBLE BUT THE RIVER COULD NOT BE
SEEN
AT MOMENTS IN THAT DIZZY DEPTH A GLEAM OF LIGHT APPEARED AND
UNDULATED VAGUELY WATER POSSESSING THE POWER OF TAKING LIGHT NO ONE
KNOWS WHENCE AND CONVERTING IT INTO A SNAKE
THE LIGHT VANISHED AND
ALL BECAME INDISTINCT ONCE MORE
IMMENSITY SEEMED THROWN OPEN THERE
WHAT LAY BELOW WAS NOT WATER IT WAS A GULF
THE WALL OF THE QUAY
ABRUPT CONFUSED MINGLED WITH THE VAPORS INSTANTLY CONCEALED FROM
SIGHT PRODUCED THE EFFECT OF AN ESCARPMENT OF THE INFINITE
NOTHING WAS
TO BE SEEN BUT THE HOSTILE CHILL OF THE WATER AND THE STALE ODOR OF
THE WET STONES COULD BE FELT
A FIERCE BREATH ROSE FROM THIS ABYSS
THE
FLOOD IN THE RIVER DIVINED RATHER THAN PERCEIVED THE TRAGIC WHISPERING
OF THE WAVES THE MELANCHOLY VASTNESS OF THE ARCHES OF THE BRIDGE THE
IMAGINABLE FALL INTO THAT GLOOMY VOID INTO ALL THAT SHADOW WAS FULL OF
HORROR
JAVERT REMAINED MOTIONLESS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES GAZING AT THIS OPENING
OF SHADOW HE CONSIDERED THE INVISIBLE WITH A FIXITY THAT RESEMBLED
ATTENTION
THE WATER ROARED
ALL AT ONCE HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND PLACED
IT ON THE EDGE OF THE QUAY
A MOMENT LATER A TALL BLACK FIGURE WHICH
A BELATED PASSER BY IN THE DISTANCE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN FOR A PHANTOM
APPEARED ERECT UPON THE PARAPET OF THE QUAY BENT OVER TOWARDS THE
SEINE THEN DREW ITSELF UP AGAIN AND FELL STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE
SHADOWS A DULL SPLASH FOLLOWED AND THE SHADOW ALONE WAS IN THE SECRET
OF THE CONVULSIONS OF THAT OBSCURE FORM WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED BENEATH
THE WATER
BOOK FIFTH GRANDSON AND GRANDFATHER
CHAPTER I IN WHICH THE TREE WITH THE ZINC PLASTER APPEARS AGAIN
SOME TIME AFTER THE EVENTS WHICH WE HAVE JUST RECORDED SIEUR
BOULATRUELLE EXPERIENCED A LIVELY EMOTION
SIEUR BOULATRUELLE WAS THAT ROAD MENDER OF MONTFERMEIL WHOM THE READER
HAS ALREADY SEEN IN THE GLOOMY PARTS OF THIS BOOK
BOULATRUELLE AS THE READER MAY PERCHANCE RECALL WAS A MAN WHO
WAS OCCUPIED WITH DIVERS AND TROUBLESOME MATTERS
HE BROKE STONES AND
DAMAGED TRAVELLERS ON THE HIGHWAY
ROAD MENDER AND THIEF AS HE WAS HE CHERISHED ONE DREAM HE BELIEVED IN
THE TREASURES BURIED IN THE FOREST OF MONTFERMEIL
HE HOPED SOME DAY TO
FIND THE MONEY IN THE EARTH AT THE FOOT OF A TREE IN THE MEANWHILE HE
LIVED TO SEARCH THE POCKETS OF PASSERS BY
NEVERTHELESS FOR AN INSTANT HE WAS PRUDENT
HE HAD JUST ESCAPED
NEATLY
HE HAD BEEN AS THE READER IS AWARE PICKED UP IN JONDRETTE'S
GARRET IN COMPANY WITH THE OTHER RUFFIANS
UTILITY OF A VICE HIS
DRUNKENNESS HAD BEEN HIS SALVATION
THE AUTHORITIES HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO MAKE OUT WHETHER HE HAD BEEN THERE IN THE QUALITY OF A ROBBER OR A
MAN WHO HAD BEEN ROBBED
AN ORDER OF NOLLE PROSEQUI FOUNDED ON HIS WELL
AUTHENTICATED STATE OF INTOXICATION ON THE EVENING OF THE AMBUSH HAD
SET HIM AT LIBERTY
HE HAD TAKEN TO HIS HEELS
HE HAD RETURNED TO HIS
ROAD FROM GAGNY TO LAGNY TO MAKE UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE SUPERVISION
BROKEN STONE FOR THE GOOD OF THE STATE WITH DOWNCAST MIEN IN A VERY
PENSIVE MOOD HIS ARDOR FOR THEFT SOMEWHAT COOLED BUT HE WAS ADDICTED
NONE THE LESS TENDERLY TO THE WINE WHICH HAD RECENTLY SAVED HIM
AS FOR THE LIVELY EMOTION WHICH HE HAD EXPERIENCED A SHORT TIME AFTER
HIS RETURN TO HIS ROAD MENDER'S TURF THATCHED COT HERE IT IS
ONE MORNING BOULATRUELLE WHILE ON HIS WAY AS WAS HIS WONT TO HIS
WORK AND POSSIBLY ALSO TO HIS AMBUSH A LITTLE BEFORE DAYBREAK CAUGHT
SIGHT THROUGH THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES OF A MAN WHOSE BACK ALONE
HE SAW BUT THE SHAPE OF WHOSE SHOULDERS AS IT SEEMED TO HIM AT THAT
DISTANCE AND IN THE EARLY DUSK WAS NOT ENTIRELY UNFAMILIAR TO HIM
BOULATRUELLE ALTHOUGH INTOXICATED HAD A CORRECT AND LUCID MEMORY A
DEFENSIVE ARM THAT IS INDISPENSABLE TO ANY ONE WHO IS AT ALL IN CONFLICT
WITH LEGAL ORDER
WHERE THE DEUCE HAVE I SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAN YONDER HE SAID
TO HIMSELF
BUT HE COULD MAKE HIMSELF NO ANSWER EXCEPT THAT THE MAN
RESEMBLED SOME ONE OF WHOM HIS MEMORY PRESERVED A CONFUSED TRACE
HOWEVER APART FROM THE IDENTITY WHICH HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO CATCH
BOULATRUELLE PUT THINGS TOGETHER AND MADE CALCULATIONS
THIS MAN DID
NOT BELONG IN THE COUNTRY SIDE
HE HAD JUST ARRIVED THERE
ON FOOT
EVIDENTLY
NO PUBLIC CONVEYANCE PASSES THROUGH MONTFERMEIL AT THAT HOUR
HE HAD WALKED ALL NIGHT
WHENCE CAME HE NOT FROM A VERY GREAT DISTANCE
FOR HE HAD NEITHER HAVERSACK NOR BUNDLE
FROM PARIS NO DOUBT
WHY WAS
HE IN THESE WOODS WHY WAS HE THERE AT SUCH AN HOUR WHAT HAD HE COME
THERE FOR
BOULATRUELLE THOUGHT OF THE TREASURE
BY DINT OF RANSACKING HIS MEMORY
HE RECALLED IN A VAGUE WAY THAT HE HAD ALREADY MANY YEARS BEFORE HAD
A SIMILAR ALARM IN CONNECTION WITH A MAN WHO PRODUCED ON HIM THE EFFECT
THAT HE MIGHT WELL BE THIS VERY INDIVIDUAL
BY THE DEUCE SAID BOULATRUELLE I'LL FIND HIM AGAIN
I'LL DISCOVER
THE PARISH OF THAT PARISHIONER
THIS PROWLER OF PATRON MINETTE HAS A
REASON AND I'LL KNOW IT
PEOPLE CAN'T HAVE SECRETS IN MY FOREST IF I
DON'T HAVE A FINGER IN THE PIE
HE TOOK HIS PICK AXE WHICH WAS VERY SHARPLY POINTED
THERE NOW HE GRUMBLED IS SOMETHING THAT WILL SEARCH THE EARTH AND A
MAN
AND AS ONE KNOTS ONE THREAD TO ANOTHER THREAD HE TOOK UP THE LINE OF
MARCH AT HIS BEST PACE IN THE DIRECTION WHICH THE MAN MUST FOLLOW AND
SET OUT ACROSS THE THICKETS
WHEN HE HAD COMPASSED A HUNDRED STRIDES THE DAY WHICH WAS ALREADY
BEGINNING TO BREAK CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE
FOOTPRINTS STAMPED IN THE
SAND WEEDS TRODDEN DOWN HERE AND THERE HEATHER CRUSHED YOUNG BRANCHES
IN THE BRUSHWOOD BENT AND IN THE ACT OF STRAIGHTENING THEMSELVES UP
AGAIN WITH THE GRACEFUL DELIBERATION OF THE ARMS OF A PRETTY WOMAN WHO
STRETCHES HERSELF WHEN SHE WAKES POINTED OUT TO HIM A SORT OF TRACK
HE
FOLLOWED IT THEN LOST IT
TIME WAS FLYING
HE PLUNGED DEEPER INTO THE
WOODS AND CAME TO A SORT OF EMINENCE
AN EARLY HUNTSMAN WHO WAS PASSING
IN THE DISTANCE ALONG A PATH WHISTLING THE AIR OF GUILLERY SUGGESTED
TO HIM THE IDEA OF CLIMBING A TREE
OLD AS HE WAS HE WAS AGILE
THERE
STOOD CLOSE AT HAND A BEECH TREE OF GREAT SIZE WORTHY OF TITYRUS AND OF
BOULATRUELLE
BOULATRUELLE ASCENDED THE BEECH AS HIGH AS HE WAS ABLE
THE IDEA WAS A GOOD ONE
ON SCRUTINIZING THE SOLITARY WASTE ON THE SIDE
WHERE THE FOREST IS THOROUGHLY ENTANGLED AND WILD BOULATRUELLE SUDDENLY
CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS MAN
HARDLY HAD HE GOT HIS EYE UPON HIM WHEN HE LOST SIGHT OF HIM
THE MAN ENTERED OR RATHER GLIDED INTO AN OPEN GLADE AT A
CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE MASKED BY LARGE TREES BUT WITH WHICH
BOULATRUELLE WAS PERFECTLY FAMILIAR ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING NOTICED NEAR
A LARGE PILE OF POROUS STONES AN AILING CHESTNUT TREE BANDAGED WITH
A SHEET OF ZINC NAILED DIRECTLY UPON THE BARK
THIS GLADE WAS THE ONE
WHICH WAS FORMERLY CALLED THE BLARU BOTTOM
THE HEAP OF STONES DESTINED
FOR NO ONE KNOWS WHAT EMPLOYMENT WHICH WAS VISIBLE THERE THIRTY YEARS
AGO IS DOUBTLESS STILL THERE
NOTHING EQUALS A HEAP OF STONES IN
LONGEVITY UNLESS IT IS A BOARD FENCE
THEY ARE TEMPORARY EXPEDIENTS
WHAT A REASON FOR LASTING
BOULATRUELLE WITH THE RAPIDITY OF JOY DROPPED RATHER THAN DESCENDED
FROM THE TREE
THE LAIR WAS UNEARTHED THE QUESTION NOW WAS TO SEIZE THE
BEAST
THAT FAMOUS TREASURE OF HIS DREAMS WAS PROBABLY THERE
IT WAS NO SMALL MATTER TO REACH THAT GLADE
BY THE BEATEN PATHS WHICH
INDULGE IN A THOUSAND TEASING ZIGZAGS IT REQUIRED A GOOD QUARTER OF AN
HOUR
IN A BEE LINE THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH WHICH IS PECULIARLY DENSE
VERY THORNY AND VERY AGGRESSIVE IN THAT LOCALITY A FULL HALF HOUR WAS
NECESSARY
BOULATRUELLE COMMITTED THE ERROR OF NOT COMPREHENDING THIS
HE BELIEVED IN THE STRAIGHT LINE A RESPECTABLE OPTICAL ILLUSION WHICH
RUINS MANY A MAN
THE THICKET BRISTLING AS IT WAS STRUCK HIM AS THE
BEST ROAD
LET'S TAKE TO THE WOLVES' RUE DE RIVOLI SAID HE
BOULATRUELLE ACCUSTOMED TO TAKING CROOKED COURSES WAS ON THIS OCCASION
GUILTY OF THE FAULT OF GOING STRAIGHT
HE FLUNG HIMSELF RESOLUTELY INTO THE TANGLE OF UNDERGROWTH
HE HAD TO DEAL WITH HOLLY BUSHES NETTLES HAWTHORNS EGLANTINES
THISTLES AND VERY IRASCIBLE BRAMBLES
HE WAS MUCH LACERATED
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE HE FOUND WATER WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO
TRAVERSE
AT LAST HE REACHED THE BLARU BOTTOM AFTER THE LAPSE OF FORTY MINUTES
SWEATING SOAKED BREATHLESS SCRATCHED AND FEROCIOUS
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE GLADE
BOULATRUELLE RUSHED TO THE HEAP OF
STONES
IT WAS IN ITS PLACE
IT HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED OFF
AS FOR THE MAN HE HAD VANISHED IN THE FOREST
HE HAD MADE HIS ESCAPE
WHERE IN WHAT DIRECTION INTO WHAT THICKET IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS
AND HEARTRENDING TO SAY THERE BEHIND THE PILE OF STONES IN FRONT OF
THE TREE WITH THE SHEET OF ZINC WAS FRESHLY TURNED EARTH A PICK AXE
ABANDONED OR FORGOTTEN AND A HOLE
THE HOLE WAS EMPTY
THIEF SHRIEKED BOULATRUELLE SHAKING HIS FIST AT THE HORIZON
CHAPTER II MARIUS EMERGING FROM CIVIL WAR MAKES READY FOR DOMESTIC
WAR
FOR A LONG TIME MARIUS WAS NEITHER DEAD NOR ALIVE
FOR MANY WEEKS HE
LAY IN A FEVER ACCOMPANIED BY DELIRIUM AND BY TOLERABLY GRAVE CEREBRAL
SYMPTOMS CAUSED MORE BY THE SHOCKS OF THE WOUNDS ON THE HEAD THAN BY
THE WOUNDS THEMSELVES
HE REPEATED COSETTE'S NAME FOR WHOLE NIGHTS IN THE MELANCHOLY LOQUACITY
OF FEVER AND WITH THE SOMBRE OBSTINACY OF AGONY
THE EXTENT OF SOME OF
THE LESIONS PRESENTED A SERIOUS DANGER THE SUPPURATION OF LARGE WOUNDS
BEING ALWAYS LIABLE TO BECOME RE ABSORBED AND CONSEQUENTLY TO KILL
THE SICK MAN UNDER CERTAIN ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AT EVERY CHANGE OF
WEATHER AT THE SLIGHTEST STORM THE PHYSICIAN WAS UNEASY
ABOVE ALL THINGS HE REPEATED LET THE WOUNDED MAN BE SUBJECTED TO NO
EMOTION THE DRESSING OF THE WOUNDS WAS COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
THE FIXATION OF APPARATUS AND BANDAGES BY CERECLOTHS NOT HAVING BEEN
INVENTED AS YET AT THAT EPOCH
NICOLETTE USED UP A SHEET AS BIG AS THE
CEILING AS SHE PUT IT FOR LINT
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
THAT THE CHLORURETTED LOTIONS AND THE NITRATE OF SILVER OVERCAME THE
GANGRENE
AS LONG AS THERE WAS ANY DANGER M
GILLENORMAND SEATED IN
DESPAIR AT HIS GRANDSON'S PILLOW WAS LIKE MARIUS NEITHER ALIVE NOR
DEAD
EVERY DAY SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY A VERY WELL DRESSED GENTLEMAN WITH
WHITE HAIR SUCH WAS THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY THE PORTER CAME TO
INQUIRE ABOUT THE WOUNDED MAN AND LEFT A LARGE PACKAGE OF LINT FOR THE
DRESSINGS
FINALLY ON THE 7TH OF SEPTEMBER FOUR MONTHS TO A DAY AFTER THE
SORROWFUL NIGHT WHEN HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO HIS GRANDFATHER IN A
DYING CONDITION THE DOCTOR DECLARED THAT HE WOULD ANSWER FOR MARIUS
CONVALESCENCE BEGAN
BUT MARIUS WAS FORCED TO REMAIN FOR TWO MONTHS MORE
STRETCHED OUT ON A LONG CHAIR ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESULTS CALLED UP BY
THE FRACTURE OF HIS COLLAR BONE
THERE ALWAYS IS A LAST WOUND LIKE THAT
WHICH WILL NOT CLOSE AND WHICH PROLONGS THE DRESSINGS INDEFINITELY TO
THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE SICK PERSON
HOWEVER THIS LONG ILLNESS AND THIS LONG CONVALESCENCE SAVED HIM
FROM ALL PURSUIT
IN FRANCE THERE IS NO WRATH NOT EVEN OF A PUBLIC
CHARACTER WHICH SIX MONTHS WILL NOT EXTINGUISH
REVOLTS IN THE PRESENT
STATE OF SOCIETY ARE SO MUCH THE FAULT OF EVERY ONE THAT THEY ARE
FOLLOWED BY A CERTAIN NECESSITY OF SHUTTING THE EYES
LET US ADD THAT THE INEXCUSABLE GISQUET ORDER WHICH ENJOINED DOCTORS
TO LODGE INFORMATION AGAINST THE WOUNDED HAVING OUTRAGED PUBLIC
OPINION AND NOT OPINION ALONE BUT THE KING FIRST OF ALL THE WOUNDED
WERE COVERED AND PROTECTED BY THIS INDIGNATION AND WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN MADE PRISONERS IN THE VERY ACT OF COMBAT THE
COUNCILS OF WAR DID NOT DARE TO TROUBLE ANY ONE
SO MARIUS WAS LEFT IN
PEACE
M
GILLENORMAND FIRST PASSED THROUGH ALL MANNER OF ANGUISH AND THEN
THROUGH EVERY FORM OF ECSTASY
IT WAS FOUND DIFFICULT TO PREVENT HIS
PASSING EVERY NIGHT BESIDE THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD HIS BIG ARM CHAIR
CARRIED TO MARIUS' BEDSIDE HE REQUIRED HIS DAUGHTER TO TAKE THE
FINEST LINEN IN THE HOUSE FOR COMPRESSES AND BANDAGES
MADEMOISELLE
GILLENORMAND LIKE A SAGE AND ELDERLY PERSON CONTRIVED TO SPARE THE
FINE LINEN WHILE ALLOWING THE GRANDFATHER TO THINK THAT HE WAS OBEYED
M
GILLENORMAND WOULD NOT PERMIT ANY ONE TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT FOR THE
PREPARATION OF LINT BATISTE IS NOT NEARLY SO GOOD AS COARSE LINEN
NOR NEW LINEN AS OLD LINEN
HE WAS PRESENT AT ALL THE DRESSINGS OF THE
WOUNDS FROM WHICH MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND MODESTLY ABSENTED HERSELF
WHEN THE DEAD FLESH WAS CUT AWAY WITH SCISSORS HE SAID AIE AIE
NOTHING WAS MORE TOUCHING THAN TO SEE HIM WITH HIS GENTLE SENILE PALSY
OFFER THE WOUNDED MAN A CUP OF HIS COOLING DRAUGHT
HE OVERWHELMED THE
DOCTOR WITH QUESTIONS
HE DID NOT OBSERVE THAT HE ASKED THE SAME ONES
OVER AND OVER AGAIN
ON THE DAY WHEN THE DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO HIM THAT MARIUS WAS OUT OF
DANGER THE GOOD MAN WAS IN A DELIRIUM
HE MADE HIS PORTER A PRESENT OF
THREE LOUIS
THAT EVENING ON HIS RETURN TO HIS OWN CHAMBER HE DANCED
A GAVOTTE USING HIS THUMB AND FOREFINGER AS CASTANETS AND HE SANG THE
FOLLOWING SONG
JEANNE EST NEE A FOUGERE AMOUR TU VIS EN ELLE
VRAI NID D'UNE BERGERE CAR C'EST DANS SA PRUNELLE
J'ADORE SON JUPON QUE TU METS TON CARQUOIS
FRIPON
NARQUOIS
MOI JE LA CHANTE ET J'AIME
PLUS QUE DIANE MEME
JEANNE ET SES DURS TETONS
BRETONS 61
LOVE THOU DWELLEST IN HER FOR 'TIS IN HER EYES THAT THOU PLACEST THY
QUIVER SLY SCAMP
AS FOR ME I SING HER AND I LOVE MORE THAN DIANA HERSELF JEANNE AND
HER FIRM BRETON BREASTS
THEN HE KNELT UPON A CHAIR AND BASQUE WHO WAS WATCHING HIM THROUGH THE
HALF OPEN DOOR MADE SURE THAT HE WAS PRAYING
UP TO THAT TIME HE HAD NOT BELIEVED IN GOD
AT EACH SUCCEEDING PHASE OF IMPROVEMENT WHICH BECAME MORE AND MORE
PRONOUNCED THE GRANDFATHER RAVED
HE EXECUTED A MULTITUDE OF MECHANICAL
ACTIONS FULL OF JOY HE ASCENDED AND DESCENDED THE STAIRS WITHOUT
KNOWING WHY
A PRETTY FEMALE NEIGHBOR WAS AMAZED ONE MORNING AT
RECEIVING A BIG BOUQUET IT WAS M
GILLENORMAND WHO HAD SENT IT TO
HER
THE HUSBAND MADE A JEALOUS SCENE
M
GILLENORMAND TRIED TO DRAW
NICOLETTE UPON HIS KNEES
HE CALLED MARIUS M
LE BARON HE SHOUTED
LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC
EVERY MOMENT HE KEPT ASKING THE DOCTOR IS HE NO LONGER IN DANGER
HE GAZED UPON MARIUS WITH THE EYES OF A GRANDMOTHER
HE BROODED OVER HIM
WHILE HE ATE
HE NO LONGER KNEW HIMSELF HE NO LONGER RENDERED HIMSELF
AN ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF
MARIUS WAS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS
ABDICATION IN HIS JOY HE WAS THE GRANDSON OF HIS GRANDSON
IN THE STATE OF JOY IN WHICH HE THEN WAS HE WAS THE MOST VENERABLE OF
CHILDREN
IN HIS FEAR LEST HE MIGHT FATIGUE OR ANNOY THE CONVALESCENT
HE STEPPED BEHIND HIM TO SMILE
HE WAS CONTENT JOYOUS DELIGHTED
CHARMING YOUNG
HIS WHITE LOCKS ADDED A GENTLE MAJESTY TO THE GAY
RADIANCE OF HIS VISAGE
WHEN GRACE IS MINGLED WITH WRINKLES IT IS
ADORABLE
THERE IS AN INDESCRIBABLE AURORA IN BEAMING OLD AGE
AS FOR MARIUS AS HE ALLOWED THEM TO DRESS HIS WOUNDS AND CARE FOR HIM
HE HAD BUT ONE FIXED IDEA COSETTE
AFTER THE FEVER AND DELIRIUM HAD LEFT HIM HE DID NOT AGAIN PRONOUNCE
HER NAME AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THAT HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF
HER
HE HELD HIS PEACE PRECISELY BECAUSE HIS SOUL WAS THERE
HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF COSETTE THE WHOLE AFFAIR OF THE
RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE WAS LIKE A CLOUD IN HIS MEMORY SHADOWS THAT WERE
ALMOST INDISTINCT FLOATED THROUGH HIS MIND EPONINE GAVROCHE MABEUF
THE THENARDIERS ALL HIS FRIENDS GLOOMILY INTERMINGLED WITH THE SMOKE
OF THE BARRICADE THE STRANGE PASSAGE OF M
FAUCHELEVENT THROUGH THAT
ADVENTURE PRODUCED ON HIM THE EFFECT OF A PUZZLE IN A TEMPEST HE
UNDERSTOOD NOTHING CONNECTED WITH HIS OWN LIFE HE DID NOT KNOW HOW NOR
BY WHOM HE HAD BEEN SAVED AND NO ONE OF THOSE AROUND HIM KNEW THIS ALL
THAT THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO TELL HIM WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT HOME
AT NIGHT IN A HACKNEY COACH TO THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE PAST
PRESENT FUTURE WERE NOTHING MORE TO HIM THAN THE MIST OF A VAGUE IDEA
BUT IN THAT FOG THERE WAS ONE IMMOVABLE POINT ONE CLEAR AND PRECISE
OUTLINE SOMETHING MADE OF GRANITE A RESOLUTION A WILL TO FIND
COSETTE ONCE MORE
FOR HIM THE IDEA OF LIFE WAS NOT DISTINCT FROM THE
IDEA OF COSETTE
HE HAD DECREED IN HIS HEART THAT HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT
THE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER AND HE WAS IMMOVABLY RESOLVED TO EXACT OF
ANY PERSON WHATEVER WHO SHOULD DESIRE TO FORCE HIM TO LIVE FROM HIS
GRANDFATHER FROM FATE FROM HELL THE RESTITUTION OF HIS VANISHED
EDEN
HE DID NOT CONCEAL FROM HIMSELF THE FACT THAT OBSTACLES EXISTED
LET US HERE EMPHASIZE ONE DETAIL HE WAS NOT WON OVER AND WAS BUT LITTLE
SOFTENED BY ALL THE SOLICITUDE AND TENDERNESS OF HIS GRANDFATHER
IN
THE FIRST PLACE HE WAS NOT IN THE SECRET THEN IN HIS REVERIES OF
AN INVALID WHICH WERE STILL FEVERISH POSSIBLY HE DISTRUSTED THIS
TENDERNESS AS A STRANGE AND NOVEL THING WHICH HAD FOR ITS OBJECT HIS
CONQUEST
HE REMAINED COLD
THE GRANDFATHER ABSOLUTELY WASTED HIS POOR
OLD SMILE
MARIUS SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS ALL RIGHT SO LONG AS HE
MARIUS DID NOT SPEAK AND LET THINGS TAKE THEIR COURSE BUT THAT WHEN
IT BECAME A QUESTION OF COSETTE HE WOULD FIND ANOTHER FACE AND THAT
HIS GRANDFATHER'S TRUE ATTITUDE WOULD BE UNMASKED
THEN THERE WOULD
BE AN UNPLEASANT SCENE A RECRUDESCENCE OF FAMILY QUESTIONS A
CONFRONTATION OF POSITIONS EVERY SORT OF SARCASM AND ALL MANNER OF
OBJECTIONS AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME FAUCHELEVENT COUPELEVENT FORTUNE
POVERTY A STONE ABOUT HIS NECK THE FUTURE
VIOLENT RESISTANCE
CONCLUSION A REFUSAL
MARIUS STIFFENED HIMSELF IN ADVANCE
AND THEN IN PROPORTION AS HE REGAINED LIFE THE OLD ULCERS OF HIS
MEMORY OPENED ONCE MORE HE REFLECTED AGAIN ON THE PAST COLONEL
PONTMERCY PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE BETWEEN M
GILLENORMAND AND HIM
MARIUS HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE HAD NO TRUE KINDNESS TO EXPECT FROM
A PERSON WHO HAD BEEN SO UNJUST AND SO HARD TO HIS FATHER
AND
WITH HEALTH THERE RETURNED TO HIM A SORT OF HARSHNESS TOWARDS HIS
GRANDFATHER
THE OLD MAN WAS GENTLY PAINED BY THIS
M
GILLENORMAND
WITHOUT HOWEVER ALLOWING IT TO APPEAR OBSERVED THAT MARIUS EVER SINCE
THE LATTER HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO HIM AND HAD REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
HAD NOT ONCE CALLED HIM FATHER
IT IS TRUE THAT HE DID NOT SAY
MONSIEUR TO HIM BUT HE CONTRIVED NOT TO SAY EITHER THE ONE OR THE
OTHER BY MEANS OF A CERTAIN WAY OF TURNING HIS PHRASES
OBVIOUSLY A
CRISIS WAS APPROACHING
AS ALMOST ALWAYS HAPPENS IN SUCH CASES MARIUS SKIRMISHED BEFORE GIVING
BATTLE BY WAY OF PROVING HIMSELF
THIS IS CALLED FEELING THE GROUND
ONE MORNING IT CAME TO PASS THAT M
GILLENORMAND SPOKE SLIGHTINGLY OF
THE CONVENTION APROPOS OF A NEWSPAPER WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO HIS
HANDS AND GAVE VENT TO A ROYALIST HARANGUE ON DANTON SAINT JUSTE AND
ROBESPIERRE THE MEN OF '93 WERE GIANTS SAID MARIUS WITH SEVERITY
THE OLD MAN HELD HIS PEACE AND UTTERED NOT A SOUND DURING THE REMAINDER
OF THAT DAY
MARIUS WHO HAD ALWAYS PRESENT TO HIS MIND THE INFLEXIBLE GRANDFATHER OF
HIS EARLY YEARS INTERPRETED THIS SILENCE AS A PROFOUND CONCENTRATION
OF WRATH AUGURED FROM IT A HOT CONFLICT AND AUGMENTED HIS PREPARATIONS
FOR THE FRAY IN THE INMOST RECESSES OF HIS MIND
HE DECIDED THAT IN CASE OF A REFUSAL HE WOULD TEAR OFF HIS BANDAGES
DISLOCATE HIS COLLAR BONE THAT HE WOULD LAY BARE ALL THE WOUNDS WHICH
HE HAD LEFT AND WOULD REJECT ALL FOOD
HIS WOUNDS WERE HIS MUNITIONS OF
WAR
HE WOULD HAVE COSETTE OR DIE
HE AWAITED THE PROPITIOUS MOMENT WITH THE CRAFTY PATIENCE OF THE SICK
THAT MOMENT ARRIVED
CHAPTER III MARIUS ATTACKED
ONE DAY M
GILLENORMAND WHILE HIS DAUGHTER WAS PUTTING IN ORDER THE
PHIALS AND CUPS ON THE MARBLE OF THE COMMODE BENT OVER MARIUS AND SAID
TO HIM IN HIS TENDEREST ACCENTS LOOK HERE MY LITTLE MARIUS IF I WERE
IN YOUR PLACE I WOULD EAT MEAT NOW IN PREFERENCE TO FISH
A FRIED SOLE
IS EXCELLENT TO BEGIN A CONVALESCENCE WITH BUT A GOOD CUTLET IS NEEDED
TO PUT A SICK MAN ON HIS FEET
MARIUS WHO HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY RECOVERED HIS STRENGTH COLLECTED
THE WHOLE OF IT DREW HIMSELF UP INTO A SITTING POSTURE LAID HIS TWO
CLENCHED FISTS ON THE SHEETS OF HIS BED LOOKED HIS GRANDFATHER IN THE
FACE ASSUMED A TERRIBLE AIR AND SAID
THIS LEADS ME TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU
WHAT IS IT
THAT I WISH TO MARRY
AGREED SAID HIS GRANDFATHER AND HE BURST OUT LAUGHING
HOW AGREED
YES AGREED
YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR LITTLE GIRL
MARIUS STUNNED AND OVERWHELMED WITH THE DAZZLING SHOCK TREMBLED IN
EVERY LIMB
M
GILLENORMAND WENT ON
YES YOU SHALL HAVE HER THAT PRETTY LITTLE GIRL OF YOURS
SHE COMES
EVERY DAY IN THE SHAPE OF AN OLD GENTLEMAN TO INQUIRE AFTER YOU
EVER
SINCE YOU WERE WOUNDED SHE HAS PASSED HER TIME IN WEEPING AND MAKING
LINT
I HAVE MADE INQUIRIES
SHE LIVES IN THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME NO
7
AH THERE WE HAVE IT AH SO YOU WANT HER WELL YOU SHALL HAVE
HER

YOURSELF 'I'M GOING TO SIGNIFY THIS SQUARELY TO MY GRANDFATHER TO
THAT MUMMY OF THE REGENCY AND OF THE DIRECTORY TO THAT ANCIENT BEAU
TO THAT DORANTE TURNED GERONTE HE HAS INDULGED IN HIS FRIVOLITIES ALSO
THAT HE HAS AND HE HAS HAD HIS LOVE AFFAIRS AND HIS GRISETTES AND HIS
COSETTES HE HAS MADE HIS RUSTLE HE HAS HAD HIS WINGS HE HAS EATEN OF
THE BREAD OF SPRING HE CERTAINLY MUST REMEMBER IT AH YOU TAKE THE
COCKCHAFER BY THE HORNS
THAT'S GOOD
I OFFER YOU A CUTLET AND YOU
ANSWER ME 'BY THE WAY I WANT TO MARRY THERE'S A TRANSITION FOR
YOU AH YOU RECKONED ON A BICKERING YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM AN OLD
COWARD
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT YOU ARE VEXED YOU DID NOT EXPECT TO
FIND YOUR GRANDFATHER STILL MORE FOOLISH THAN YOURSELF YOU ARE WASTING
THE DISCOURSE WHICH YOU MEANT TO BESTOW UPON ME MR
LAWYER AND THAT'S
VEXATIOUS
WELL SO MUCH THE WORSE RAGE AWAY
I'LL DO WHATEVER
YOU WISH AND THAT CUTS YOU SHORT IMBECILE LISTEN
I HAVE MADE MY
INQUIRIES I'M CUNNING TOO SHE IS CHARMING SHE IS DISCREET IT IS NOT
TRUE ABOUT THE LANCER SHE HAS MADE HEAPS OF LINT SHE'S A JEWEL SHE
ADORES YOU IF YOU HAD DIED THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN THREE OF US HER
COFFIN WOULD HAVE ACCOMPANIED MINE
I HAVE HAD AN IDEA EVER SINCE YOU
HAVE BEEN BETTER OF SIMPLY PLANTING HER AT YOUR BEDSIDE BUT IT IS ONLY
IN ROMANCES THAT YOUNG GIRLS ARE BROUGHT TO THE BEDSIDES OF HANDSOME
YOUNG WOUNDED MEN WHO INTEREST THEM
IT IS NOT DONE
WHAT WOULD YOUR
AUNT HAVE SAID TO IT YOU WERE NUDE THREE QUARTERS OF THE TIME MY GOOD
FELLOW
ASK NICOLETTE WHO HAS NOT LEFT YOU FOR A MOMENT IF THERE WAS
ANY POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A WOMAN HERE
AND THEN WHAT WOULD THE DOCTOR
HAVE SAID A PRETTY GIRL DOES NOT CURE A MAN OF FEVER
IN SHORT IT'S
ALL RIGHT LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT ALL'S SAID ALL'S DONE IT'S ALL
SETTLED TAKE HER
SUCH IS MY FEROCITY
YOU SEE I PERCEIVED THAT YOU
DID NOT LOVE ME
I SAID TO MYSELF 'HERE NOW I HAVE MY LITTLE COSETTE
RIGHT UNDER MY HAND I'M GOING TO GIVE HER TO HIM HE WILL BE OBLIGED
TO LOVE ME A LITTLE THEN OR HE MUST TELL THE REASON WHY AH SO YOU
THOUGHT THAT THE OLD MAN WAS GOING TO STORM TO PUT ON A BIG VOICE
TO SHOUT NO AND TO LIFT HIS CANE AT ALL THAT AURORA
NOT A BIT OF IT
COSETTE SO BE IT LOVE SO BE IT I ASK NOTHING BETTER
PRAY TAKE THE
TROUBLE OF GETTING MARRIED SIR
BE HAPPY MY WELL BELOVED CHILD
THAT SAID THE OLD MAN BURST FORTH INTO SOBS
AND HE SEIZED MARIUS' HEAD AND PRESSED IT WITH BOTH ARMS AGAINST HIS
BREAST AND BOTH FELL TO WEEPING
THIS IS ONE OF THE FORMS OF SUPREME
HAPPINESS
FATHER CRIED MARIUS
AH SO YOU LOVE ME SAID THE OLD MAN
AN INEFFABLE MOMENT ENSUED
THEY WERE CHOKING AND COULD NOT SPEAK
AT LENGTH THE OLD MAN STAMMERED
COME HIS MOUTH IS UNSTOPPED AT LAST
HE HAS SAID 'FATHER' TO ME
MARIUS DISENGAGED HIS HEAD FROM HIS GRANDFATHER'S ARMS AND SAID GENTLY
BUT FATHER NOW THAT I AM QUITE WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I MIGHT SEE
HER
AGREED AGAIN YOU SHALL SEE HER TO MORROW
FATHER
WHAT
WHY NOT TO DAY
WELL TO DAY THEN
LET IT BE TO DAY
YOU HAVE CALLED ME 'FATHER' THREE
TIMES AND IT IS WORTH IT
I WILL ATTEND TO IT
SHE SHALL BE BROUGHT
HITHER
AGREED I TELL YOU
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN PUT INTO VERSE
THIS IS
THE ENDING OF THE ELEGY OF THE 'JEUNE MALADE' BY ANDRE CHENIER BY ANDRE
CHENIER WHOSE THROAT WAS CUT BY THE RAS
BY THE GIANTS OF '93
M
GILLENORMAND FANCIED THAT HE DETECTED A FAINT FROWN ON THE PART OF
MARIUS WHO IN TRUTH AS WE MUST ADMIT WAS NO LONGER LISTENING TO HIM
AND WHO WAS THINKING FAR MORE OF COSETTE THAN OF 1793
THE GRANDFATHER TREMBLING AT HAVING SO INOPPORTUNELY INTRODUCED ANDRE
CHENIER RESUMED PRECIPITATELY
CUT HIS THROAT IS NOT THE WORD
THE FACT IS THAT THE GREAT
REVOLUTIONARY GENIUSES WHO WERE NOT MALICIOUS THAT IS INCONTESTABLE
WHO WERE HEROES PARDI FOUND THAT ANDRE CHENIER EMBARRASSED THEM
SOMEWHAT AND THEY HAD HIM GUILLOT
THAT IS TO SAY THOSE GREAT
MEN ON THE 7TH OF THERMIDOR BESOUGHT ANDRE CHENIER IN THE INTERESTS OF
PUBLIC SAFETY TO BE SO GOOD AS TO GO
M
GILLENORMAND CLUTCHED BY THE THROAT BY HIS OWN PHRASE COULD NOT
PROCEED
BEING ABLE NEITHER TO FINISH IT NOR TO RETRACT IT WHILE HIS
DAUGHTER ARRANGED THE PILLOW BEHIND MARIUS WHO WAS OVERWHELMED WITH SO
MANY EMOTIONS THE OLD MAN RUSHED HEADLONG WITH AS MUCH RAPIDITY AS
HIS AGE PERMITTED FROM THE BED CHAMBER SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND
PURPLE CHOKING AND FOAMING AT THE MOUTH HIS EYES STARTING FROM HIS
HEAD HE FOUND HIMSELF NOSE TO NOSE WITH HONEST BASQUE WHO WAS BLACKING
BOOTS IN THE ANTEROOM
HE SEIZED BASQUE BY THE COLLAR AND SHOUTED FULL
IN HIS FACE IN FURY BY THE HUNDRED THOUSAND JAVOTTES OF THE DEVIL
THOSE RUFFIANS DID ASSASSINATE HIM
WHO SIR
ANDRE CHENIER
YES SIR SAID BASQUE IN ALARM
CHAPTER IV MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND ENDS BY NO LONGER THINKING IT A
BAD THING THAT M
FAUCHELEVENT SHOULD HAVE ENTERED WITH SOMETHING UNDER
HIS ARM
COSETTE AND MARIUS BEHELD EACH OTHER ONCE MORE
WHAT THAT INTERVIEW WAS LIKE WE DECLINE TO SAY
THERE ARE THINGS WHICH
ONE MUST NOT ATTEMPT TO DEPICT THE SUN IS ONE OF THEM
THE ENTIRE FAMILY INCLUDING BASQUE AND NICOLETTE WERE ASSEMBLED IN
MARIUS' CHAMBER AT THE MOMENT WHEN COSETTE ENTERED IT
PRECISELY AT THAT MOMENT THE GRANDFATHER WAS ON THE POINT OF BLOWING
HIS NOSE HE STOPPED SHORT HOLDING HIS NOSE IN HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND
GAZING OVER IT AT COSETTE
SHE APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE WAS SURROUNDED
BY A GLORY
ADORABLE HE EXCLAIMED
THEN HE BLEW HIS NOSE NOISILY
COSETTE WAS INTOXICATED DELIGHTED FRIGHTENED IN HEAVEN
SHE WAS AS
THOROUGHLY ALARMED AS ANY ONE CAN BE BY HAPPINESS
SHE STAMMERED ALL
PALE YET FLUSHED SHE WANTED TO FLING HERSELF INTO MARIUS' ARMS AND
DARED NOT
ASHAMED OF LOVING IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THESE PEOPLE
PEOPLE
ARE PITILESS TOWARDS HAPPY LOVERS THEY REMAIN WHEN THE LATTER MOST
DESIRE TO BE LEFT ALONE
LOVERS HAVE NO NEED OF ANY PEOPLE WHATEVER
WITH COSETTE AND BEHIND HER THERE HAD ENTERED A MAN WITH WHITE HAIR
WHO WAS GRAVE YET SMILING THOUGH WITH A VAGUE AND HEARTRENDING SMILE
IT WAS MONSIEUR FAUCHELEVENT IT WAS JEAN VALJEAN
HE WAS VERY WELL DRESSED AS THE PORTER HAD SAID ENTIRELY IN BLACK IN
PERFECTLY NEW GARMENTS AND WITH A WHITE CRAVAT
THE PORTER WAS A THOUSAND LEAGUES FROM RECOGNIZING IN THIS CORRECT
BOURGEOIS IN THIS PROBABLE NOTARY THE FEAR INSPIRING BEARER OF THE
CORPSE WHO HAD SPRUNG UP AT HIS DOOR ON THE NIGHT OF THE 7TH OF JUNE
TATTERED MUDDY HIDEOUS HAGGARD HIS FACE MASKED IN BLOOD AND MIRE
SUPPORTING IN HIS ARMS THE FAINTING MARIUS STILL HIS PORTER'S SCENT
WAS AROUSED
WHEN M
FAUCHELEVENT ARRIVED WITH COSETTE THE PORTER HAD
NOT BEEN ABLE TO REFRAIN FROM COMMUNICATING TO HIS WIFE THIS ASIDE I
DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS BUT I CAN'T HELP FANCYING THAT I'VE SEEN THAT FACE
BEFORE
M
FAUCHELEVENT IN MARIUS' CHAMBER REMAINED APART NEAR THE DOOR
HE
HAD UNDER HIS ARM A PACKAGE WHICH BORE CONSIDERABLE RESEMBLANCE TO AN
OCTAVO VOLUME ENVELOPED IN PAPER
THE ENVELOPING PAPER WAS OF A GREENISH
HUE AND APPEARED TO BE MOULDY
DOES THE GENTLEMAN ALWAYS HAVE BOOKS LIKE THAT UNDER HIS ARM
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND WHO DID NOT LIKE BOOKS DEMANDED IN A LOW
TONE OF NICOLETTE
WELL RETORTED M
GILLENORMAND WHO HAD OVERHEARD HER IN THE SAME
TONE HE'S A LEARNED MAN
WHAT THEN IS THAT HIS FAULT MONSIEUR
BOULARD ONE OF MY ACQUAINTANCES NEVER WALKED OUT WITHOUT A BOOK UNDER
HIS ARM EITHER AND HE ALWAYS HAD SOME OLD VOLUME HUGGED TO HIS HEART
LIKE THAT
AND WITH A BOW HE SAID ALOUD
MONSIEUR TRANCHELEVENT
FATHER GILLENORMAND DID NOT DO IT INTENTIONALLY BUT INATTENTION TO
PROPER NAMES WAS AN ARISTOCRATIC HABIT OF HIS
MONSIEUR TRANCHELEVENT I HAVE THE HONOR OF ASKING YOU ON BEHALF OF MY
GRANDSON BARON MARIUS PONTMERCY FOR THE HAND OF MADEMOISELLE
MONSIEUR TRANCHELEVENT BOWED
THAT'S SETTLED SAID THE GRANDFATHER
AND TURNING TO MARIUS AND COSETTE WITH BOTH ARMS EXTENDED IN BLESSING
HE CRIED
PERMISSION TO ADORE EACH OTHER
THEY DID NOT REQUIRE HIM TO REPEAT IT TWICE
SO MUCH THE WORSE THE
CHIRPING BEGAN
THEY TALKED LOW
MARIUS RESTING ON HIS ELBOW ON HIS
RECLINING CHAIR COSETTE STANDING BESIDE HIM
OH HEAVENS MURMURED
COSETTE I SEE YOU ONCE AGAIN IT IS THOU IT IS YOU THE IDEA OF GOING
AND FIGHTING LIKE THAT BUT WHY IT IS HORRIBLE
I HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR
FOUR MONTHS
OH HOW WICKED IT WAS OF YOU TO GO TO THAT BATTLE WHAT HAD
I DONE TO YOU I PARDON YOU BUT YOU WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN
A LITTLE
WHILE AGO WHEN THEY CAME TO TELL US TO COME TO YOU I STILL THOUGHT
THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE BUT IT WAS FROM JOY
I WAS SO SAD I HAVE NOT
TAKEN THE TIME TO DRESS MYSELF I MUST FRIGHTEN PEOPLE WITH MY LOOKS
WHAT WILL YOUR RELATIVES SAY TO SEE ME IN A CRUMPLED COLLAR DO SPEAK
YOU LET ME DO ALL THE TALKING
WE ARE STILL IN THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME
IT SEEMS THAT YOUR SHOULDER WAS TERRIBLE
THEY TOLD ME THAT YOU COULD
PUT YOUR FIST IN IT
AND THEN IT SEEMS THAT THEY CUT YOUR FLESH WITH
THE SCISSORS
THAT IS FRIGHTFUL
I HAVE CRIED TILL I HAVE NO EYES LEFT
IT IS QUEER THAT A PERSON CAN SUFFER LIKE THAT
YOUR GRANDFATHER HAS A
VERY KINDLY AIR
DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF DON'T RISE ON YOUR ELBOW YOU
WILL INJURE YOURSELF
OH HOW HAPPY I AM SO OUR UNHAPPINESS IS OVER
I AM QUITE FOOLISH
I HAD THINGS TO SAY TO YOU AND I NO LONGER KNOW IN
THE LEAST WHAT THEY WERE
DO YOU STILL LOVE ME WE LIVE IN THE RUE DE
L'HOMME ARME
THERE IS NO GARDEN
I MADE LINT ALL THE TIME STAY SIR
LOOK IT IS YOUR FAULT I HAVE A CALLOUS ON MY FINGERS
ANGEL SAID MARIUS
ANGEL IS THE ONLY WORD IN THE LANGUAGE WHICH CANNOT BE WORN OUT
NO
OTHER WORD COULD RESIST THE MERCILESS USE WHICH LOVERS MAKE OF IT
THEN AS THERE WERE SPECTATORS THEY PAUSED AND SAID NOT A WORD MORE
CONTENTING THEMSELVES WITH SOFTLY TOUCHING EACH OTHER'S HANDS
M
GILLENORMAND TURNED TOWARDS THOSE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM AND CRIED
TALK LOUD THE REST OF YOU
MAKE A NOISE YOU PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES
COME A LITTLE UPROAR THE DEUCE SO THAT THE CHILDREN CAN CHATTER AT
THEIR EASE
AND APPROACHING MARIUS AND COSETTE HE SAID TO THEM IN A VERY LOW
VOICE
CALL EACH OTHER THOU
DON'T STAND ON CEREMONY
AUNT GILLENORMAND LOOKED ON IN AMAZEMENT AT THIS IRRUPTION OF LIGHT
IN HER ELDERLY HOUSEHOLD
THERE WAS NOTHING AGGRESSIVE ABOUT THIS
AMAZEMENT IT WAS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD LIKE THE SCANDALIZED AND
ENVIOUS GLANCE OF AN OWL AT TWO TURTLE DOVES IT WAS THE STUPID EYE OF A
POOR INNOCENT SEVEN AND FIFTY YEARS OF AGE IT WAS A LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN
A FAILURE GAZING AT THAT TRIUMPH LOVE
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND SENIOR SAID HER FATHER TO HER I TOLD YOU
THAT THIS IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU
HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED
LOOK AT THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS
THEN HE TURNED TO COSETTE
HOW PRETTY SHE IS HOW PRETTY SHE IS SHE'S A GREUZE
SO YOU ARE GOING
TO HAVE THAT ALL TO YOURSELF YOU SCAMP AH MY ROGUE YOU ARE GETTING
OFF NICELY WITH ME YOU ARE HAPPY IF I WERE NOT FIFTEEN YEARS TOO OLD
WE WOULD FIGHT WITH SWORDS TO SEE WHICH OF US SHOULD HAVE HER
COME NOW
I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU MADEMOISELLE
IT'S PERFECTLY SIMPLE
IT IS YOUR
RIGHT
YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT
AH WHAT A SWEET CHARMING LITTLE WEDDING
THIS WILL MAKE OUR PARISH IS SAINT DENIS DU SAINT SACRAMENT BUT I WILL
GET A DISPENSATION SO THAT YOU CAN BE MARRIED AT SAINT PAUL
THE CHURCH
IS BETTER
IT WAS BUILT BY THE JESUITS
IT IS MORE COQUETTISH
IT IS
OPPOSITE THE FOUNTAIN OF CARDINAL DE BIRAGUE
THE MASTERPIECE OF JESUIT
ARCHITECTURE IS AT NAMUR
IT IS CALLED SAINT LOUP
YOU MUST GO THERE
AFTER YOU ARE MARRIED
IT IS WORTH THE JOURNEY
MADEMOISELLE I AM QUITE
OF YOUR MIND I THINK GIRLS OUGHT TO MARRY THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE MADE
FOR
THERE IS A CERTAIN SAINTE CATHERINE WHOM I SHOULD ALWAYS LIKE TO
SEE UNCOIFFED 62 IT'S A FINE THING TO REMAIN A SPINSTER BUT IT IS
CHILLY
THE BIBLE SAYS MULTIPLY
IN ORDER TO SAVE THE PEOPLE JEANNE
D'ARC IS NEEDED BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE PEOPLE WHAT IS NEEDED IS MOTHER
GOOSE
SO MARRY MY BEAUTIES
I REALLY DO NOT SEE THE USE IN REMAINING
A SPINSTER I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THEIR CHAPEL APART IN THE CHURCH
AND THAT THEY FALL BACK ON THE SOCIETY OF THE VIRGIN BUT SAPRISTI A
HANDSOME HUSBAND A FINE FELLOW AND AT THE EXPIRATION OF A YEAR A
BIG BLOND BRAT WHO NURSES LUSTILY AND WHO HAS FINE ROLLS OF FAT ON HIS
THIGHS AND WHO MUSSES UP YOUR BREAST IN HANDFULS WITH HIS LITTLE ROSY
PAWS LAUGHING THE WHILE LIKE THE DAWN THAT'S BETTER THAN HOLDING A
CANDLE AT VESPERS AND CHANTING TURRIS EBURNEA
THE GRANDFATHER EXECUTED A PIROUETTE ON HIS EIGHTY YEAR OLD HEELS AND
BEGAN TO TALK AGAIN LIKE A SPRING THAT HAS BROKEN LOOSE ONCE MORE
AINSI BORNANT LES COURS DE TES REVASSERIES
ALCIPPE IL EST DONC VRAI DANS PEU TU TE MARIES 63
BY THE WAY

HE SEATED HIMSELF NEAR THEM MADE COSETTE SIT DOWN AND TOOK THEIR FOUR
HANDS IN HIS AGED AND WRINKLED HANDS

BARONESS WHICH IS A COME DOWN FOR HER SHE WAS BORN A MARQUISE

ADORE EACH OTHER
ONLY HE ADDED
SUDDENLY BECOMING GLOOMY WHAT A MISFORTUNE IT HAS JUST OCCURRED TO
ME MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT I POSSESS IS SWALLOWED UP IN AN ANNUITY SO
LONG AS I LIVE IT WILL NOT MATTER BUT AFTER MY DEATH A SCORE OF YEARS
HENCE AH MY POOR CHILDREN YOU WILL NOT HAVE A SOU YOUR BEAUTIFUL
WHITE HANDS MADAME LA BARONNE WILL DO THE DEVIL THE HONOR OF PULLING
HIM BY THE TAIL 64
AT THIS POINT THEY HEARD A GRAVE AND TRANQUIL VOICE SAY
MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FAUCHELEVENT POSSESSES SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
FRANCS
IT WAS THE VOICE OF JEAN VALJEAN
SO FAR HE HAD NOT UTTERED A SINGLE WORD NO ONE SEEMED TO BE AWARE THAT
HE WAS THERE AND HE HAD REMAINED STANDING ERECT AND MOTIONLESS BEHIND
ALL THESE HAPPY PEOPLE
WHAT HAS MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE TO DO WITH THE QUESTION INQUIRED THE
STARTLED GRANDFATHER
I AM SHE REPLIED COSETTE
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS RESUMED M
GILLENORMAND
MINUS FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS POSSIBLY SAID JEAN
VALJEAN
AND HE LAID ON THE TABLE THE PACKAGE WHICH MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND HAD
MISTAKEN FOR A BOOK
JEAN VALJEAN HIMSELF OPENED THE PACKAGE IT WAS A BUNDLE OF BANK NOTES
THEY WERE TURNED OVER AND COUNTED
THERE WERE FIVE HUNDRED NOTES FOR A
THOUSAND FRANCS EACH AND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED
IN ALL FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS
THIS IS A FINE BOOK SAID M
GILLENORMAND
FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS MURMURED THE AUNT

STUDENTESSES WITH SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS

GILLENORMAND IN A LOW TONE
FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR ONE MIGHT AS
WELL SAY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
AS FOR MARIUS AND COSETTE THEY WERE GAZING AT EACH OTHER WHILE THIS WAS
GOING ON THEY HARDLY HEEDED THIS DETAIL
CHAPTER V DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY IN A FOREST RATHER THAN WITH A NOTARY
THE READER HAS NO DOUBT UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT NECESSITATING A LENGTHY
EXPLANATION THAT JEAN VALJEAN AFTER THE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIR HAD BEEN
ABLE THANKS TO HIS FIRST ESCAPE OF A FEW DAYS' DURATION TO COME TO
PARIS AND TO WITHDRAW IN SEASON FROM THE HANDS OF LAFFITTE THE
SUM EARNED BY HIM UNDER THE NAME OF MONSIEUR MADELEINE AT
MONTREUIL SUR MER AND THAT FEARING THAT HE MIGHT BE RECAPTURED WHICH
EVENTUALLY HAPPENED HE HAD BURIED AND HIDDEN THAT SUM IN THE FOREST
OF MONTFERMEIL IN THE LOCALITY KNOWN AS THE BLARU BOTTOM
THE SUM
SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS ALL IN BANK BILLS WAS NOT VERY
BULKY AND WAS CONTAINED IN A BOX ONLY IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE
BOX FROM DAMPNESS HE HAD PLACED IT IN A COFFER FILLED WITH CHESTNUT
SHAVINGS
IN THE SAME COFFER HE HAD PLACED HIS OTHER TREASURES THE
BISHOP'S CANDLESTICKS
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD CARRIED OFF
THE CANDLESTICKS WHEN HE MADE HIS ESCAPE FROM MONTREUIL SUR MER
THE MAN
SEEN ONE EVENING FOR THE FIRST TIME BY BOULATRUELLE WAS JEAN VALJEAN
LATER ON EVERY TIME THAT JEAN VALJEAN NEEDED MONEY HE WENT TO GET IT
IN THE BLARU BOTTOM
HENCE THE ABSENCES WHICH WE HAVE MENTIONED
HE HAD
A PICKAXE SOMEWHERE IN THE HEATHER IN A HIDING PLACE KNOWN TO HIMSELF
ALONE
WHEN HE BEHELD MARIUS CONVALESCENT FEELING THAT THE HOUR WAS AT
HAND WHEN THAT MONEY MIGHT PROVE OF SERVICE HE HAD GONE TO GET IT
IT WAS HE AGAIN WHOM BOULATRUELLE HAD SEEN IN THE WOODS BUT ON
THIS OCCASION IN THE MORNING INSTEAD OF IN THE EVENING
BOULATREULLE
INHERITED HIS PICKAXE
THE ACTUAL SUM WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
FRANCS
JEAN VALJEAN WITHDREW THE FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS FOR HIMSELF WE
SHALL SEE HEREAFTER HE THOUGHT
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT SUM AND THE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND
FRANCS WITHDRAWN FROM LAFFITTE REPRESENTED HIS EXPENDITURE IN TEN YEARS
FROM 1823 TO 1833
THE FIVE YEARS OF HIS STAY IN THE CONVENT HAD COST
ONLY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS
JEAN VALJEAN SET THE TWO CANDLESTICKS ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE WHERE THEY
GLITTERED TO THE GREAT ADMIRATION OF TOUSSAINT
MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN KNEW THAT HE WAS DELIVERED FROM JAVERT
THE
STORY HAD BEEN TOLD IN HIS PRESENCE AND HE HAD VERIFIED THE FACT IN
THE MONITEUR HOW A POLICE INSPECTOR NAMED JAVERT HAD BEEN FOUND DROWNED
UNDER A BOAT BELONGING TO SOME LAUNDRESSES BETWEEN THE PONT AU CHANGE
AND THE PONT NEUF AND THAT A WRITING LEFT BY THIS MAN OTHERWISE
IRREPROACHABLE AND HIGHLY ESTEEMED BY HIS SUPERIORS POINTED TO A FIT
OF MENTAL ABERRATION AND A SUICIDE IN FACT THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN
SINCE HE LEFT ME AT LIBERTY ONCE HAVING GOT ME IN HIS POWER HE MUST
HAVE BEEN ALREADY MAD
CHAPTER VI THE TWO OLD MEN DO EVERYTHING EACH ONE AFTER HIS OWN
FASHION TO RENDER COSETTE HAPPY
EVERYTHING WAS MADE READY FOR THE WEDDING
THE DOCTOR ON BEING
CONSULTED DECLARED THAT IT MIGHT TAKE PLACE IN FEBRUARY
IT WAS THEN
DECEMBER
A FEW RAVISHING WEEKS OF PERFECT HAPPINESS PASSED
THE GRANDFATHER WAS NOT THE LEAST HAPPY OF THEM ALL
HE REMAINED FOR A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT A TIME GAZING AT COSETTE
THE WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE EXCLAIMED
AND SHE HAS SO SWEET AND
GOOD AN AIR SHE IS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST CHARMING GIRL THAT I
HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
LATER ON SHE'LL HAVE VIRTUES WITH AN ODOR OF
VIOLETS
HOW GRACEFUL ONE CANNOT LIVE OTHERWISE THAN NOBLY WITH SUCH
A CREATURE
MARIUS MY BOY YOU ARE A BARON YOU ARE RICH DON'T GO TO
PETTIFOGGING I BEG OF YOU
COSETTE AND MARIUS HAD PASSED ABRUPTLY FROM THE SEPULCHRE TO PARADISE
THE TRANSITION HAD NOT BEEN SOFTENED AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STUNNED
HAD THEY NOT BEEN DAZZLED BY IT
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID MARIUS TO COSETTE
NO REPLIED COSETTE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE GOOD GOD IS CARING
FOR US
JEAN VALJEAN DID EVERYTHING SMOOTHED AWAY EVERY DIFFICULTY ARRANGED
EVERYTHING MADE EVERYTHING EASY
HE HASTENED TOWARDS COSETTE'S
HAPPINESS WITH AS MUCH ARDOR AND APPARENTLY WITH AS MUCH JOY AS
COSETTE HERSELF
AS HE HAD BEEN A MAYOR HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO SOLVE THAT DELICATE
PROBLEM WITH THE SECRET OF WHICH HE ALONE WAS ACQUAINTED COSETTE'S
CIVIL STATUS
IF HE WERE TO ANNOUNCE HER ORIGIN BLUNTLY IT MIGHT
PREVENT THE MARRIAGE WHO KNOWS HE EXTRICATED COSETTE FROM ALL
DIFFICULTIES
HE CONCOCTED FOR HER A FAMILY OF DEAD PEOPLE A SURE MEANS
OF NOT ENCOUNTERING ANY OBJECTIONS
COSETTE WAS THE ONLY SCION OF AN
EXTINCT FAMILY COSETTE WAS NOT HIS OWN DAUGHTER BUT THE DAUGHTER OF
THE OTHER FAUCHELEVENT
TWO BROTHERS FAUCHELEVENT HAD BEEN GARDENERS TO
THE CONVENT OF THE PETIT PICPUS
INQUIRY WAS MADE AT THAT CONVENT THE
VERY BEST INFORMATION AND THE MOST RESPECTABLE REFERENCES ABOUNDED THE
GOOD NUNS NOT VERY APT AND BUT LITTLE INCLINED TO FATHOM QUESTIONS OF
PATERNITY AND NOT ATTACHING ANY IMPORTANCE TO THE MATTER HAD NEVER
UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY OF WHICH OF THE TWO FAUCHELEVENTS COSETTE WAS THE
DAUGHTER
THEY SAID WHAT WAS WANTED AND THEY SAID IT WITH ZEAL
AN
ACTE DE NOTORIETE WAS DRAWN UP
COSETTE BECAME IN THE EYES OF THE LAW
MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FAUCHELEVENT
SHE WAS DECLARED AN ORPHAN BOTH
FATHER AND MOTHER BEING DEAD
JEAN VALJEAN SO ARRANGED IT THAT HE WAS
APPOINTED UNDER THE NAME OF FAUCHELEVENT AS COSETTE'S GUARDIAN WITH
M
GILLENORMAND AS SUPERVISING GUARDIAN OVER HIM
AS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FRANCS THEY CONSTITUTED
A LEGACY BEQUEATHED TO COSETTE BY A DEAD PERSON WHO DESIRED TO
REMAIN UNKNOWN
THE ORIGINAL LEGACY HAD CONSISTED OF FIVE HUNDRED AND
NINETY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS BUT TEN THOUSAND FRANCS HAD BEEN EXPENDED
ON THE EDUCATION OF MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS OF THAT
AMOUNT HAVING BEEN PAID TO THE CONVENT
THIS LEGACY DEPOSITED IN
THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY WAS TO BE TURNED OVER TO COSETTE AT HER
MAJORITY OR AT THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE
THIS TAKEN AS A WHOLE WAS
VERY ACCEPTABLE AS THE READER WILL PERCEIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SUM
DUE WAS HALF A MILLION
THERE WERE SOME PECULIARITIES HERE AND THERE
IT IS TRUE BUT THEY WERE NOT NOTICED ONE OF THE INTERESTED PARTIES
HAD HIS EYES BLINDFOLDED BY LOVE THE OTHERS BY THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
FRANCS
COSETTE LEARNED THAT SHE WAS NOT THE DAUGHTER OF THAT OLD MAN WHOM SHE
HAD SO LONG CALLED FATHER
HE WAS MERELY A KINSMAN ANOTHER FAUCHELEVENT
WAS HER REAL FATHER
AT ANY OTHER TIME THIS WOULD HAVE BROKEN HER HEART
BUT AT THE INEFFABLE MOMENT WHICH SHE WAS THEN PASSING THROUGH IT CAST
BUT A SLIGHT SHADOW A FAINT CLOUD AND SHE WAS SO FULL OF JOY THAT THE
CLOUD DID NOT LAST LONG
SHE HAD MARIUS
THE YOUNG MAN ARRIVED THE OLD
MAN WAS EFFACED SUCH IS LIFE
AND THEN COSETTE HAD FOR LONG YEARS BEEN HABITUATED TO SEEING ENIGMAS
AROUND HER EVERY BEING WHO HAS HAD A MYSTERIOUS CHILDHOOD IS ALWAYS
PREPARED FOR CERTAIN RENUNCIATIONS
NEVERTHELESS SHE CONTINUED TO CALL JEAN VALJEAN FATHER
COSETTE HAPPY AS THE ANGELS WAS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER FATHER GILLENORMAND
IT IS TRUE THAT HE OVERWHELMED HER WITH GALLANT COMPLIMENTS AND
PRESENTS
WHILE JEAN VALJEAN WAS BUILDING UP FOR COSETTE A NORMAL
SITUATION IN SOCIETY AND AN UNASSAILABLE STATUS M
GILLENORMAND WAS
SUPERINTENDING THE BASKET OF WEDDING GIFTS
NOTHING SO AMUSED HIM AS
BEING MAGNIFICENT
HE HAD GIVEN TO COSETTE A ROBE OF BINCHE GUIPURE
WHICH HAD DESCENDED TO HIM FROM HIS OWN GRANDMOTHER
THESE FASHIONS COME UP AGAIN SAID HE ANCIENT THINGS ARE THE
RAGE AND THE YOUNG WOMEN OF MY OLD AGE DRESS LIKE THE OLD WOMEN OF MY
CHILDHOOD
HE RIFLED HIS RESPECTABLE CHESTS OF DRAWERS IN COROMANDEL LACQUER WITH
SWELLING FRONTS WHICH HAD NOT BEEN OPENED FOR YEARS LET US HEAR THE
CONFESSION OF THESE DOWAGERS HE SAID LET US SEE WHAT THEY HAVE IN
THEIR PAUNCHES HE NOISILY VIOLATED THE POT BELLIED DRAWERS OF ALL
HIS WIVES OF ALL HIS MISTRESSES AND OF ALL HIS GRANDMOTHERS
PEKINS
DAMASKS LAMPAS PAINTED MOIRES ROBES OF SHOT GROS DE TOURS INDIA
KERCHIEFS EMBROIDERED IN GOLD THAT COULD BE WASHED DAUPHINES WITHOUT A
RIGHT OR WRONG SIDE IN THE PIECE GENOA AND ALENCON POINT LACE
PARURES IN ANTIQUE GOLDSMITH'S WORK IVORY BON BON BOXES ORNAMENTED
WITH MICROSCOPIC BATTLES GEWGAWS AND RIBBONS HE LAVISHED EVERYTHING ON
COSETTE
COSETTE AMAZED DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH MARIUS AND WILD WITH
GRATITUDE TOWARDS M
GILLENORMAND DREAMED OF A HAPPINESS WITHOUT LIMIT
CLOTHED IN SATIN AND VELVET
HER WEDDING BASKET SEEMED TO HER TO BE
UPHELD BY SERAPHIM
HER SOUL FLEW OUT INTO THE AZURE DEPTHS WITH WINGS
OF MECHLIN LACE
THE INTOXICATION OF THE LOVERS WAS ONLY EQUALLED AS WE HAVE ALREADY
SAID BY THE ECSTASY OF THE GRANDFATHER
A SORT OF FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS
WENT ON IN THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE
EVERY MORNING A FRESH OFFERING OF BRIC A BRAC FROM THE GRANDFATHER TO
COSETTE
ALL POSSIBLE KNICKKNACKS GLITTERED AROUND HER
ONE DAY MARIUS WHO WAS FOND OF TALKING GRAVELY IN THE MIDST OF HIS
BLISS SAID APROPOS OF I KNOW NOT WHAT INCIDENT
THE MEN OF THE REVOLUTION ARE SO GREAT THAT THEY HAVE THE PRESTIGE OF
THE AGES LIKE CATO AND LIKE PHOCION AND EACH ONE OF THEM SEEMS TO ME
AN ANTIQUE MEMORY
MOIRE ANTIQUE EXCLAIMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
THANKS MARIUS
THAT IS
PRECISELY THE IDEA OF WHICH I WAS IN SEARCH
AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A MAGNIFICENT DRESS OF TEA ROSE COLORED MOIRE
ANTIQUE WAS ADDED TO COSETTE'S WEDDING PRESENTS
FROM THESE FRIPPERIES THE GRANDFATHER EXTRACTED A BIT OF WISDOM
LOVE IS ALL VERY WELL BUT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE TO GO WITH
IT
THE USELESS MUST BE MINGLED WITH HAPPINESS
HAPPINESS IS ONLY THE
NECESSARY
SEASON THAT ENORMOUSLY WITH THE SUPERFLUOUS FOR ME
A
PALACE AND HER HEART
HER HEART AND THE LOUVRE
HER HEART AND THE GRAND
WATERWORKS OF VERSAILLES
GIVE ME MY SHEPHERDESS AND TRY TO MAKE HER A
DUCHESS
FETCH ME PHYLLIS CROWNED WITH CORN FLOWERS AND ADD A HUNDRED
THOUSAND FRANCS INCOME
OPEN FOR ME A BUCOLIC PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS YOU
CAN SEE BENEATH A MARBLE COLONNADE
I CONSENT TO THE BUCOLIC AND ALSO
TO THE FAIRY SPECTACLE OF MARBLE AND GOLD
DRY HAPPINESS RESEMBLES DRY
BREAD
ONE EATS BUT ONE DOES NOT DINE
I WANT THE SUPERFLUOUS THE
USELESS THE EXTRAVAGANT EXCESS THAT WHICH SERVES NO PURPOSE
I
REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN IN THE CATHEDRAL OF STRASBURG A CLOCK AS TALL
AS A THREE STORY HOUSE WHICH MARKED THE HOURS WHICH HAD THE KINDNESS TO
INDICATE THE HOUR BUT WHICH HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING MADE FOR THAT AND
WHICH AFTER HAVING STRUCK MIDDAY OR MIDNIGHT MIDDAY THE HOUR OF THE
SUN OR MIDNIGHT THE HOUR OF LOVE OR ANY OTHER HOUR THAT YOU LIKE
GAVE YOU THE MOON AND THE STARS THE EARTH AND THE SEA BIRDS AND
FISHES PHOEBUS AND PHOEBE AND A HOST OF THINGS WHICH EMERGED FROM A
NICHE AND THE TWELVE APOSTLES AND THE EMPEROR CHARLES THE FIFTH AND
EPONINE AND SABINUS AND A THRONG OF LITTLE GILDED GOODMEN WHO PLAYED
ON THE TRUMPET TO BOOT
WITHOUT RECKONING DELICIOUS CHIMES WHICH IT
SPRINKLED THROUGH THE AIR ON EVERY OCCASION WITHOUT ANY ONE'S KNOWING
WHY
IS A PETTY BALD CLOCK FACE WHICH MERELY TELLS THE HOUR EQUAL TO
THAT FOR MY PART I AM OF THE OPINION OF THE BIG CLOCK OF STRASBURG
AND I PREFER IT TO THE CUCKOO CLOCK FROM THE BLACK FOREST
M
GILLENORMAND TALKED NONSENSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEDDING AND ALL
THE FRIPPERIES OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PASSED PELL MELL THROUGH HIS
DITHYRAMBS
YOU ARE IGNORANT OF THE ART OF FESTIVALS
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO
ORGANIZE A DAY OF ENJOYMENT IN THIS AGE HE EXCLAIMED
YOUR NINETEENTH
CENTURY IS WEAK
IT LACKS EXCESS
IT IGNORES THE RICH IT IGNORES THE
NOBLE
IN EVERYTHING IT IS CLEAN SHAVEN
YOUR THIRD ESTATE IS INSIPID
COLORLESS ODORLESS AND SHAPELESS
THE DREAMS OF YOUR BOURGEOIS WHO
SET UP AS THEY EXPRESS IT A PRETTY BOUDOIR FRESHLY DECORATED VIOLET
EBONY AND CALICO
MAKE WAY MAKE WAY THE SIEUR CURMUDGEON IS MARRYING
MADEMOISELLE CLUTCH PENNY
SUMPTUOUSNESS AND SPLENDOR
A LOUIS D'OR HAS
BEEN STUCK TO A CANDLE
THERE'S THE EPOCH FOR YOU
MY DEMAND IS THAT I
MAY FLEE FROM IT BEYOND THE SARMATIANS
AH IN 1787 I PREDICT THAT ALL
WAS LOST FROM THE DAY WHEN I BEHELD THE DUC DE ROHAN PRINCE DE LEON
DUC DE CHABOT DUC DE MONTBAZON MARQUIS DE SONBISE VICOMTE DE THOUARS
PEER OF FRANCE GO TO LONGCHAMPS IN A TAPECU THAT HAS BORNE ITS FRUITS
IN THIS CENTURY MEN ATTEND TO BUSINESS THEY GAMBLE ON 'CHANGE THEY
WIN MONEY THEY ARE STINGY
PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF THEIR SURFACES AND
VARNISH THEM EVERY ONE IS DRESSED AS THOUGH JUST OUT OF A BAND BOX
WASHED SOAPED SCRAPED SHAVED COMBED WAKED SMOOTHED RUBBED
BRUSHED CLEANED ON THE OUTSIDE IRREPROACHABLE POLISHED AS A PEBBLE
DISCREET NEAT AND AT THE SAME TIME DEATH OF MY LIFE IN THE DEPTHS OF
THEIR CONSCIENCES THEY HAVE DUNG HEAPS AND CESSPOOLS THAT ARE ENOUGH TO
MAKE A COW HERD WHO BLOWS HIS NOSE IN HIS FINGERS RECOIL
I GRANT TO
THIS AGE THE DEVICE 'DIRTY CLEANLINESS DON'T BE VEXED MARIUS GIVE
ME PERMISSION TO SPEAK I SAY NO EVIL OF THE PEOPLE AS YOU SEE I AM
ALWAYS HARPING ON YOUR PEOPLE BUT DO LOOK FAVORABLY ON MY DEALING A BIT
OF A SLAP TO THE BOURGEOISIE
I BELONG TO IT
HE WHO LOVES WELL LASHES
WELL
THEREUPON I SAY PLAINLY THAT NOW A DAYS PEOPLE MARRY BUT THAT
THEY NO LONGER KNOW HOW TO MARRY
AH IT IS TRUE I REGRET THE GRACE
OF THE ANCIENT MANNERS
I REGRET EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM THEIR ELEGANCE
THEIR CHIVALRY THOSE COURTEOUS AND DELICATE WAYS THAT JOYOUS LUXURY
WHICH EVERY ONE POSSESSED MUSIC FORMING PART OF THE WEDDING A SYMPHONY
ABOVE STAIRS A BEATING OF DRUMS BELOW STAIRS THE DANCES THE JOYOUS
FACES ROUND THE TABLE THE FINE SPUN GALLANT COMPLIMENTS THE SONGS THE
FIREWORKS THE FRANK LAUGHTER THE DEVIL'S OWN ROW THE HUGE KNOTS OF
RIBBON
I REGRET THE BRIDE'S GARTER
THE BRIDE'S GARTER IS COUSIN TO THE
GIRDLE OF VENUS
ON WHAT DOES THE WAR OF TROY TURN ON HELEN'S GARTER
PARBLEU WHY DID THEY FIGHT WHY DID DIOMED THE DIVINE BREAK OVER
THE HEAD OF MERIONES THAT GREAT BRAZEN HELMET OF TEN POINTS WHY DID
ACHILLES AND HECTOR HEW EACH OTHER UP WITH VAST BLOWS OF THEIR LANCES
BECAUSE HELEN ALLOWED PARIS TO TAKE HER GARTER
WITH COSETTE'S GARTER
HOMER WOULD CONSTRUCT THE ILIAD
HE WOULD PUT IN HIS POEM A LOQUACIOUS
OLD FELLOW LIKE ME AND HE WOULD CALL HIM NESTOR
MY FRIENDS IN BYGONE
DAYS IN THOSE AMIABLE DAYS OF YORE PEOPLE MARRIED WISELY THEY HAD A
GOOD CONTRACT AND THEN THEY HAD A GOOD CAROUSE
AS SOON AS CUJAS HAD
TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE GAMACHO ENTERED
BUT IN SOOTH THE STOMACH IS
AN AGREEABLE BEAST WHICH DEMANDS ITS DUE AND WHICH WANTS TO HAVE ITS
WEDDING ALSO
PEOPLE SUPPED WELL AND HAD AT TABLE A BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBOR
WITHOUT A GUIMPE SO THAT HER THROAT WAS ONLY MODERATELY CONCEALED
OH
THE LARGE LAUGHING MOUTHS AND HOW GAY WE WERE IN THOSE DAYS YOUTH WAS
A BOUQUET EVERY YOUNG MAN TERMINATED IN A BRANCH OF LILACS OR A TUFT
OF ROSES WHETHER HE WAS A SHEPHERD OR A WARRIOR AND IF BY CHANCE
ONE WAS A CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS ONE FOUND MEANS TO CALL ONESELF FLORIAN
PEOPLE THOUGHT MUCH OF LOOKING WELL
THEY EMBROIDERED AND TINTED
THEMSELVES
A BOURGEOIS HAD THE AIR OF A FLOWER A MARQUIS HAD THE AIR
OF A PRECIOUS STONE
PEOPLE HAD NO STRAPS TO THEIR BOOTS THEY HAD NO
BOOTS
THEY WERE SPRUCE SHINING WAVED LUSTROUS FLUTTERING DAINTY
COQUETTISH WHICH DID NOT AT ALL PREVENT THEIR WEARING SWORDS BY THEIR
SIDES
THE HUMMING BIRD HAS BEAK AND CLAWS
THAT WAS THE DAY OF THE
GALLAND INDIES
ONE OF THE SIDES OF THAT CENTURY WAS DELICATE THE OTHER
WAS MAGNIFICENT AND BY THE GREEN CABBAGES PEOPLE AMUSED THEMSELVES
TO DAY PEOPLE ARE SERIOUS
THE BOURGEOIS IS AVARICIOUS THE BOURGEOISE
IS A PRUDE YOUR CENTURY IS UNFORTUNATE
PEOPLE WOULD DRIVE AWAY THE
GRACES AS BEING TOO LOW IN THE NECK
ALAS BEAUTY IS CONCEALED AS
THOUGH IT WERE UGLINESS
SINCE THE REVOLUTION EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE
BALLET DANCERS HAS HAD ITS TROUSERS A MOUNTEBANK DANCER MUST BE GRAVE
YOUR RIGADOONS ARE DOCTRINARIAN
IT IS NECESSARY TO BE MAJESTIC
PEOPLE
WOULD BE GREATLY ANNOYED IF THEY DID NOT CARRY THEIR CHINS IN THEIR
CRAVATS
THE IDEAL OF AN URCHIN OF TWENTY WHEN HE MARRIES IS TO
RESEMBLE M
ROYER COLLARD
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE ARRIVES AT WITH
THAT MAJESTY AT BEING PETTY
LEARN THIS JOY IS NOT ONLY JOYOUS IT IS
GREAT
BUT BE IN LOVE GAYLY THEN WHAT THE DEUCE MARRY WHEN YOU MARRY
WITH FEVER AND GIDDINESS AND TUMULT AND THE UPROAR OF HAPPINESS BE
GRAVE IN CHURCH WELL AND GOOD
BUT AS SOON AS THE MASS IS FINISHED
SARPEJOU YOU MUST MAKE A DREAM WHIRL AROUND THE BRIDE
A MARRIAGE
SHOULD BE ROYAL AND CHIMERICAL IT SHOULD PROMENADE ITS CEREMONY FROM
THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS TO THE PAGODA OF CHANTELOUP
I HAVE A HORROR
OF A PALTRY WEDDING
VENTREGOULETTE BE IN OLYMPUS FOR THAT ONE DAY
AT LEAST
BE ONE OF THE GODS
AH PEOPLE MIGHT BE SYLPHS
GAMES AND
LAUGHTER ARGIRASPIDES THEY ARE STUPIDS
MY FRIENDS EVERY RECENTLY
MADE BRIDEGROOM OUGHT TO BE PRINCE ALDOBRANDINI
PROFIT BY THAT UNIQUE
MINUTE IN LIFE TO SOAR AWAY TO THE EMPYREAN WITH THE SWANS AND THE
EAGLES EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE TO FALL BACK ON THE MORROW INTO THE
BOURGEOISIE OF THE FROGS
DON'T ECONOMIZE ON THE NUPTIALS DO NOT PRUNE
THEM OF THEIR SPLENDORS DON'T SCRIMP ON THE DAY WHEN YOU BEAM
THE
WEDDING IS NOT THE HOUSEKEEPING
OH IF I WERE TO CARRY OUT MY FANCY
IT WOULD BE GALLANT VIOLINS WOULD BE HEARD UNDER THE TREES
HERE IS
MY PROGRAMME SKY BLUE AND SILVER
I WOULD MINGLE WITH THE FESTIVAL
THE RURAL DIVINITIES I WOULD CONVOKE THE DRYADS AND THE NEREIDS
THE
NUPTIALS OF AMPHITRITE A ROSY CLOUD NYMPHS WITH WELL DRESSED LOCKS
AND ENTIRELY NAKED AN ACADEMICIAN OFFERING QUATRAINS TO THE GODDESS A
CHARIOT DRAWN BY MARINE MONSTERS
TRITON TROTTAIT DEVANT ET TIRAIT DE SA CONQUE
DES SONS SI RAVISSANTS QU'IL RAVISSAIT QUICONQUE 65
THERE'S A FESTIVE PROGRAMME THERE'S A GOOD ONE OR ELSE I KNOW
NOTHING OF SUCH MATTERS DEUCE TAKE IT
WHILE THE GRANDFATHER IN FULL LYRICAL EFFUSION WAS LISTENING TO
HIMSELF COSETTE AND MARIUS GREW INTOXICATED AS THEY GAZED FREELY AT
EACH OTHER
AUNT GILLENORMAND SURVEYED ALL THIS WITH HER IMPERTURBABLE PLACIDITY
WITHIN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX MONTHS SHE HAD EXPERIENCED A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF EMOTIONS
MARIUS RETURNED MARIUS BROUGHT BACK BLEEDING MARIUS
BROUGHT BACK FROM A BARRICADE MARIUS DEAD THEN LIVING MARIUS
RECONCILED MARIUS BETROTHED MARIUS WEDDING A POOR GIRL MARIUS WEDDING
A MILLIONAIRESS
THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS HAD BEEN HER LAST
SURPRISE
THEN HER INDIFFERENCE OF A GIRL TAKING HER FIRST COMMUNION
RETURNED TO HER
SHE WENT REGULARLY TO SERVICE TOLD HER BEADS READ HER
EUCHOLOGY MUMBLED AVES IN ONE CORNER OF THE HOUSE WHILE I LOVE YOU
WAS BEING WHISPERED IN THE OTHER AND SHE BEHELD MARIUS AND COSETTE IN A
VAGUE WAY LIKE TWO SHADOWS
THE SHADOW WAS HERSELF
THERE IS A CERTAIN STATE OF INERT ASCETICISM IN WHICH THE SOUL
NEUTRALIZED BY TORPOR A STRANGER TO THAT WHICH MAY BE DESIGNATED AS THE
BUSINESS OF LIVING RECEIVES NO IMPRESSIONS EITHER HUMAN OR PLEASANT
OR PAINFUL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EARTHQUAKES AND CATASTROPHES
THIS
DEVOTION AS FATHER GILLENORMAND SAID TO HIS DAUGHTER CORRESPONDS TO
A COLD IN THE HEAD
YOU SMELL NOTHING OF LIFE
NEITHER ANY BAD NOR ANY
GOOD ODOR
MOREOVER THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS HAD SETTLED THE ELDERLY
SPINSTER'S INDECISION
HER FATHER HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF TAKING HER
SO LITTLE INTO ACCOUNT THAT HE HAD NOT CONSULTED HER IN THE MATTER OF
CONSENT TO MARIUS' MARRIAGE
HE HAD ACTED IMPETUOUSLY ACCORDING TO HIS
WONT HAVING A DESPOT TURNED SLAVE BUT A SINGLE THOUGHT TO SATISFY
MARIUS
AS FOR THE AUNT IT HAD NOT EVEN OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE AUNT
EXISTED AND THAT SHE COULD HAVE AN OPINION OF HER OWN AND SHEEP AS
SHE WAS THIS HAD VEXED HER
SOMEWHAT RESENTFUL IN HER INMOST SOUL BUT
IMPASSIVE EXTERNALLY SHE HAD SAID TO HERSELF MY FATHER HAS SETTLED
THE QUESTION OF THE MARRIAGE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ME I SHALL SETTLE THE
QUESTION OF THE INHERITANCE WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM SHE WAS RICH IN
FACT AND HER FATHER WAS NOT
SHE HAD RESERVED HER DECISION ON THIS
POINT
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HAD THE MATCH BEEN A POOR ONE SHE WOULD
HAVE LEFT HIM POOR
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR MY NEPHEW HE IS WEDDING A
BEGGAR LET HIM BE A BEGGAR HIMSELF BUT COSETTE'S HALF MILLION PLEASED
THE AUNT AND ALTERED HER INWARD SITUATION SO FAR AS THIS PAIR OF LOVERS
WERE CONCERNED
ONE OWES SOME CONSIDERATION TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
FRANCS AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN LEAVE
HER FORTUNE TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SINCE THEY DID NOT NEED IT
IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THE COUPLE SHOULD LIVE WITH THE GRANDFATHER M
GILLENORMAND INSISTED ON RESIGNING TO THEM HIS CHAMBER THE FINEST IN
THE HOUSE
THAT WILL MAKE ME YOUNG AGAIN HE SAID
IT'S AN OLD PLAN
OF MINE
I HAVE ALWAYS ENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF HAVING A WEDDING IN MY
CHAMBER
HE FURNISHED THIS CHAMBER WITH A MULTITUDE OF ELEGANT TRIFLES
HE HAD
THE CEILING AND WALLS HUNG WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY STUFF WHICH HE HAD BY
HIM IN THE PIECE AND WHICH HE BELIEVED TO HAVE EMANATED FROM UTRECHT
WITH A BUTTERCUP COLORED SATIN GROUND COVERED WITH VELVET AURICULA
BLOSSOMS IT WAS WITH THAT STUFF SAID HE THAT THE BED OF THE
DUCHESSE D'ANVILLE AT LA ROCHE GUYON WAS DRAPED ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
HE SET A LITTLE FIGURE IN SAXE PORCELAIN CARRYING A MUFF AGAINST HER
NUDE STOMACH
M
GILLENORMAND'S LIBRARY BECAME THE LAWYER'S STUDY WHICH MARIUS
NEEDED A STUDY IT WILL BE REMEMBERED BEING REQUIRED BY THE COUNCIL OF
THE ORDER
CHAPTER VII THE EFFECTS OF DREAMS MINGLED WITH HAPPINESS
THE LOVERS SAW EACH OTHER EVERY DAY
COSETTE CAME WITH M
FAUCHELEVENT THIS IS REVERSING THINGS SAID MADEMOISELLE
GILLENORMAND TO HAVE THE BRIDE COME TO THE HOUSE TO DO THE COURTING
LIKE THIS BUT MARIUS' CONVALESCENCE HAD CAUSED THE HABIT TO BECOME
ESTABLISHED AND THE ARM CHAIRS OF THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE
BETTER ADAPTED TO INTERVIEWS THAN THE STRAW CHAIRS OF THE RUE DE L'HOMME
ARME HAD ROOTED IT
MARIUS AND M
FAUCHELEVENT SAW EACH OTHER BUT DID
NOT ADDRESS EACH OTHER
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THIS HAD BEEN AGREED UPON
EVERY GIRL NEEDS A CHAPERON
COSETTE COULD NOT HAVE COME WITHOUT
M
FAUCHELEVENT
IN MARIUS' EYES M
FAUCHELEVENT WAS THE CONDITION
ATTACHED TO COSETTE
HE ACCEPTED IT
BY DINT OF DISCUSSING POLITICAL
MATTERS VAGUELY AND WITHOUT PRECISION FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE
GENERAL AMELIORATION OF THE FATE OF ALL MEN THEY CAME TO SAY A LITTLE
MORE THAN YES AND NO ONCE ON THE SUBJECT OF EDUCATION WHICH
MARIUS WISHED TO HAVE FREE AND OBLIGATORY MULTIPLIED UNDER ALL FORMS
LAVISHED ON EVERY ONE LIKE THE AIR AND THE SUN IN A WORD RESPIRABLE
FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION THEY WERE IN UNISON AND THEY ALMOST
CONVERSED
M
FAUCHELEVENT TALKED WELL AND EVEN WITH A CERTAIN
LOFTINESS OF LANGUAGE STILL HE LACKED SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLE
M
FAUCHELEVENT POSSESSED SOMETHING LESS AND ALSO SOMETHING MORE THAN A
MAN OF THE WORLD
MARIUS INWARDLY AND IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS THOUGHT SURROUNDED WITH
ALL SORTS OF MUTE QUESTIONS THIS M
FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS TO HIM SIMPLY
BENEVOLENT AND COLD
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN DOUBTS AS TO HIS OWN
RECOLLECTIONS OCCURRED TO HIM
THERE WAS A VOID IN HIS MEMORY A BLACK
SPOT AN ABYSS EXCAVATED BY FOUR MONTHS OF AGONY MANY THINGS HAD BEEN
LOST THEREIN
HE HAD COME TO THE POINT OF ASKING HIMSELF WHETHER IT WERE
REALLY A FACT THAT HE HAD SEEN M
FAUCHELEVENT SO SERIOUS AND SO CALM A
MAN IN THE BARRICADE
THIS WAS NOT HOWEVER THE ONLY STUPOR WHICH THE APPARITIONS AND THE
DISAPPEARANCES OF THE PAST HAD LEFT IN HIS MIND
IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED
THAT HE WAS DELIVERED FROM ALL THOSE OBSESSIONS OF THE MEMORY WHICH
FORCE US EVEN WHEN HAPPY EVEN WHEN SATISFIED TO GLANCE SADLY BEHIND
US
THE HEAD WHICH DOES NOT TURN BACKWARDS TOWARDS HORIZONS THAT HAVE
VANISHED CONTAINS NEITHER THOUGHT NOR LOVE
AT TIMES MARIUS CLASPED HIS
FACE BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND THE VAGUE AND TUMULTUOUS PAST TRAVERSED THE
TWILIGHT WHICH REIGNED IN HIS BRAIN
AGAIN HE BEHELD MABEUF FALL HE
HEARD GAVROCHE SINGING AMID THE GRAPE SHOT HE FELT BENEATH HIS LIPS THE
COLD BROW OF EPONINE ENJOLRAS COURFEYRAC JEAN PROUVAIRE COMBEFERRE
BOSSUET GRANTAIRE ALL HIS FRIENDS ROSE ERECT BEFORE HIM THEN
DISPERSED INTO THIN AIR
WERE ALL THOSE DEAR SORROWFUL VALIANT
CHARMING OR TRAGIC BEINGS MERELY DREAMS HAD THEY ACTUALLY EXISTED THE
REVOLT HAD ENVELOPED EVERYTHING IN ITS SMOKE
THESE GREAT FEVERS CREATE
GREAT DREAMS
HE QUESTIONED HIMSELF HE FELT HIMSELF ALL THESE VANISHED
REALITIES MADE HIM DIZZY
WHERE WERE THEY ALL THEN WAS IT REALLY TRUE
THAT ALL WERE DEAD A FALL INTO THE SHADOWS HAD CARRIED OFF ALL EXCEPT
HIMSELF
IT ALL SEEMED TO HIM TO HAVE DISAPPEARED AS THOUGH BEHIND THE
CURTAIN OF A THEATRE
THERE ARE CURTAINS LIKE THIS WHICH DROP IN LIFE
GOD PASSES ON TO THE FOLLOWING ACT
AND HE HIMSELF WAS HE ACTUALLY THE SAME MAN HE THE POOR MAN WAS
RICH HE THE ABANDONED HAD A FAMILY HE THE DESPAIRING WAS TO MARRY
COSETTE
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD TRAVERSED A TOMB AND THAT HE HAD
ENTERED INTO IT BLACK AND HAD EMERGED FROM IT WHITE AND IN THAT TOMB
THE OTHERS HAD REMAINED
AT CERTAIN MOMENTS ALL THESE BEINGS OF THE
PAST RETURNED AND PRESENT FORMED A CIRCLE AROUND HIM AND OVERSHADOWED
HIM THEN HE THOUGHT OF COSETTE AND RECOVERED HIS SERENITY BUT NOTHING
LESS THAN THIS FELICITY COULD HAVE SUFFICED TO EFFACE THAT CATASTROPHE
M
FAUCHELEVENT ALMOST OCCUPIED A PLACE AMONG THESE VANISHED BEINGS
MARIUS HESITATED TO BELIEVE THAT THE FAUCHELEVENT OF THE BARRICADE WAS
THE SAME AS THIS FAUCHELEVENT IN FLESH AND BLOOD SITTING SO GRAVELY
BESIDE COSETTE
THE FIRST WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE NIGHTMARES
OCCASIONED AND BROUGHT BACK BY HIS HOURS OF DELIRIUM
HOWEVER
THE NATURES OF BOTH MEN WERE RIGID NO QUESTION FROM MARIUS TO M
FAUCHELEVENT WAS POSSIBLE
SUCH AN IDEA HAD NOT EVEN OCCURRED TO HIM
WE
HAVE ALREADY INDICATED THIS CHARACTERISTIC DETAIL
TWO MEN WHO HAVE A SECRET IN COMMON AND WHO BY A SORT OF TACIT
AGREEMENT EXCHANGE NOT A WORD ON THE SUBJECT ARE LESS RARE THAN IS
COMMONLY SUPPOSED
ONCE ONLY DID MARIUS MAKE THE ATTEMPT
HE INTRODUCED INTO THE
CONVERSATION THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE AND TURNING TO M
FAUCHELEVENT
HE SAID TO HIM
OF COURSE YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THAT STREET
WHAT STREET
THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE
I HAVE NO IDEA OF THE NAME OF THAT STREET REPLIED M
FAUCHELEVENT IN
THE MOST NATURAL MANNER IN THE WORLD
THE RESPONSE WHICH BORE UPON THE NAME OF THE STREET AND NOT UPON THE
STREET ITSELF APPEARED TO MARIUS TO BE MORE CONCLUSIVE THAN IT REALLY
WAS
DECIDEDLY THOUGHT HE I HAVE BEEN DREAMING
I HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO
A HALLUCINATION
IT WAS SOME ONE WHO RESEMBLED HIM
M
FAUCHELEVENT WAS
NOT THERE
CHAPTER VIII TWO MEN IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND
MARIUS' ENCHANTMENT GREAT AS IT WAS COULD NOT EFFACE FROM HIS MIND
OTHER PRE OCCUPATIONS
WHILE THE WEDDING WAS IN PREPARATION AND WHILE AWAITING THE DATE FIXED
UPON HE CAUSED DIFFICULT AND SCRUPULOUS RETROSPECTIVE RESEARCHES TO BE
MADE
HE OWED GRATITUDE IN VARIOUS QUARTERS HE OWED IT ON HIS FATHER'S
ACCOUNT HE OWED IT ON HIS OWN
THERE WAS THENARDIER THERE WAS THE UNKNOWN MAN WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM
MARIUS BACK TO M
GILLENORMAND
MARIUS ENDEAVORED TO FIND THESE TWO MEN NOT INTENDING TO MARRY TO
BE HAPPY AND TO FORGET THEM AND FEARING THAT WERE THESE DEBTS OF
GRATITUDE NOT DISCHARGED THEY WOULD LEAVE A SHADOW ON HIS LIFE WHICH
PROMISED SO BRIGHTLY FOR THE FUTURE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO LEAVE ALL THESE ARREARS OF SUFFERING BEHIND
HIM AND HE WISHED BEFORE ENTERING JOYOUSLY INTO THE FUTURE TO OBTAIN
A QUITTANCE FROM THE PAST
THAT THENARDIER WAS A VILLAIN DETRACTED NOTHING FROM THE FACT THAT HE
HAD SAVED COLONEL PONTMERCY
THENARDIER WAS A RUFFIAN IN THE EYES OF ALL
THE WORLD EXCEPT MARIUS
AND MARIUS IGNORANT OF THE REAL SCENE IN THE BATTLE FIELD OF WATERLOO
WAS NOT AWARE OF THE PECULIAR DETAIL THAT HIS FATHER SO FAR AS
THENARDIER WAS CONCERNED WAS IN THE STRANGE POSITION OF BEING INDEBTED
TO THE LATTER FOR HIS LIFE WITHOUT BEING INDEBTED TO HIM FOR ANY
GRATITUDE
NONE OF THE VARIOUS AGENTS WHOM MARIUS EMPLOYED SUCCEEDED IN DISCOVERING
ANY TRACE OF THENARDIER
OBLITERATION APPEARED TO BE COMPLETE IN
THAT QUARTER
MADAME THENARDIER HAD DIED IN PRISON PENDING THE TRIAL
THENARDIER AND HIS DAUGHTER AZELMA THE ONLY TWO REMAINING OF THAT
LAMENTABLE GROUP HAD PLUNGED BACK INTO THE GLOOM
THE GULF OF THE
SOCIAL UNKNOWN HAD SILENTLY CLOSED ABOVE THOSE BEINGS
ON THE SURFACE
THERE WAS NOT VISIBLE SO MUCH AS THAT QUIVER THAT TREMBLING THOSE
OBSCURE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES WHICH ANNOUNCE THAT SOMETHING HAS FALLEN IN
AND THAT THE PLUMMET MAY BE DROPPED
MADAME THENARDIER BEING DEAD BOULATRUELLE BEING ELIMINATED FROM THE
CASE CLAQUESOUS HAVING DISAPPEARED THE PRINCIPAL PERSONS ACCUSED
HAVING ESCAPED FROM PRISON THE TRIAL CONNECTED WITH THE AMBUSH IN THE
GORBEAU HOUSE HAD COME TO NOTHING
THAT AFFAIR HAD REMAINED RATHER OBSCURE
THE BENCH OF ASSIZES HAD BEEN
OBLIGED TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH TWO SUBORDINATES
PANCHAUD ALIAS
PRINTANIER ALIAS BIGRENAILLE AND DEMI LIARD ALIAS DEUX MILLIARDS WHO
HAD BEEN INCONSISTENTLY CONDEMNED AFTER A HEARING OF BOTH SIDES OF
THE CASE TO TEN YEARS IN THE GALLEYS
HARD LABOR FOR LIFE HAD BEEN THE
SENTENCE PRONOUNCED AGAINST THE ESCAPED AND CONTUMACIOUS ACCOMPLICES
THENARDIER THE HEAD AND LEADER HAD BEEN THROUGH CONTUMACY LIKEWISE
CONDEMNED TO DEATH
THIS SENTENCE WAS THE ONLY INFORMATION REMAINING ABOUT THENARDIER
CASTING UPON THAT BURIED NAME ITS SINISTER LIGHT LIKE A CANDLE BESIDE A
BIER
MOREOVER BY THRUSTING THENARDIER BACK INTO THE VERY REMOTEST DEPTHS
THROUGH A FEAR OF BEING RE CAPTURED THIS SENTENCE ADDED TO THE DENSITY
OF THE SHADOWS WHICH ENVELOPED THIS MAN
AS FOR THE OTHER PERSON AS FOR THE UNKNOWN MAN WHO HAD SAVED MARIUS
THE RESEARCHES WERE AT FIRST TO SOME EXTENT SUCCESSFUL THEN CAME TO
AN ABRUPT CONCLUSION
THEY SUCCEEDED IN FINDING THE CARRIAGE WHICH HAD
BROUGHT MARIUS TO THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE ON THE EVENING OF THE
6TH OF JUNE
THE COACHMAN DECLARED THAT ON THE 6TH OF JUNE IN OBEDIENCE TO THE
COMMANDS OF A POLICE AGENT HE HAD STOOD FROM THREE O'CLOCK IN THE
AFTERNOON UNTIL NIGHTFALL ON THE QUAI DES CHAMPS ELYSEES ABOVE THE
OUTLET OF THE GRAND SEWER THAT TOWARDS NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
THE GRATING OF THE SEWER WHICH ABUTS ON THE BANK OF THE RIVER HAD
OPENED THAT A MAN HAD EMERGED THEREFROM BEARING ON HIS SHOULDERS
ANOTHER MAN WHO SEEMED TO BE DEAD THAT THE AGENT WHO WAS ON THE WATCH
AT THAT POINT HAD ARRESTED THE LIVING MAN AND HAD SEIZED THE DEAD MAN
THAT AT THE ORDER OF THE POLICE AGENT HE THE COACHMAN HAD TAKEN ALL
THOSE FOLKS INTO HIS CARRIAGE THAT THEY HAD FIRST DRIVEN TO THE RUE
DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE THAT THEY HAD THERE DEPOSITED THE DEAD MAN THAT
THE DEAD MAN WAS MONSIEUR MARIUS AND THAT HE THE COACHMAN RECOGNIZED
HIM PERFECTLY ALTHOUGH HE WAS ALIVE THIS TIME THAT AFTERWARDS THEY
HAD ENTERED THE VEHICLE AGAIN THAT HE HAD WHIPPED UP HIS HORSES A FEW
PACES FROM THE GATE OF THE ARCHIVES THEY HAD CALLED TO HIM TO HALT
THAT THERE IN THE STREET THEY HAD PAID HIM AND LEFT HIM AND THAT THE
POLICE AGENT HAD LED THE OTHER MAN AWAY THAT HE KNEW NOTHING MORE THAT
THE NIGHT HAD BEEN VERY DARK
MARIUS AS WE HAVE SAID RECALLED NOTHING
HE ONLY REMEMBERED THAT HE
HAD BEEN SEIZED FROM BEHIND BY AN ENERGETIC HAND AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE
WAS FALLING BACKWARDS INTO THE BARRICADE THEN EVERYTHING VANISHED SO
FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED
HE HAD ONLY REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS AT M
GILLENORMAND'S
HE WAS LOST IN CONJECTURES
HE COULD NOT DOUBT HIS OWN IDENTITY
STILL HOW HAD IT COME TO PASS
THAT HAVING FALLEN IN THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE HE HAD BEEN PICKED
UP BY THE POLICE AGENT ON THE BANKS OF THE SEINE NEAR THE PONT DES
INVALIDES
SOME ONE HAD CARRIED HIM FROM THE QUARTIER DES HALLES TO THE
CHAMPS ELYSEES
AND HOW THROUGH THE SEWER
UNHEARD OF DEVOTION
SOME ONE WHO
THIS WAS THE MAN FOR WHOM MARIUS WAS SEARCHING
OF THIS MAN WHO WAS HIS SAVIOR NOTHING NOT A TRACE NOT THE FAINTEST
INDICATION
MARIUS ALTHOUGH FORCED TO PRESERVE GREAT RESERVE IN THAT DIRECTION
PUSHED HIS INQUIRIES AS FAR AS THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE
THERE NO MORE
THAN ELSEWHERE DID THE INFORMATION OBTAINED LEAD TO ANY ENLIGHTENMENT
THE PREFECTURE KNEW LESS ABOUT THE MATTER THAN DID THE HACKNEY COACHMAN
THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY ARREST HAVING BEEN MADE ON THE 6TH OF JUNE
AT THE MOUTH OF THE GRAND SEWER
NO REPORT OF ANY AGENT HAD BEEN RECEIVED THERE UPON THIS MATTER WHICH
WAS REGARDED AT THE PREFECTURE AS A FABLE
THE INVENTION OF THIS FABLE
WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE COACHMAN
A COACHMAN WHO WANTS A GRATUITY IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING EVEN OF
IMAGINATION
THE FACT WAS ASSURED NEVERTHELESS AND MARIUS COULD NOT
DOUBT IT UNLESS HE DOUBTED HIS OWN IDENTITY AS WE HAVE JUST SAID
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SINGULAR ENIGMA WAS INEXPLICABLE
WHAT HAD BECOME OF THAT MAN THAT MYSTERIOUS MAN WHOM THE COACHMAN HAD
SEEN EMERGE FROM THE GRATING OF THE GRAND SEWER BEARING UPON HIS BACK
THE UNCONSCIOUS MARIUS AND WHOM THE POLICE AGENT ON THE WATCH HAD
ARRESTED IN THE VERY ACT OF RESCUING AN INSURGENT WHAT HAD BECOME OF
THE AGENT HIMSELF
WHY HAD THIS AGENT PRESERVED SILENCE HAD THE MAN SUCCEEDED IN MAKING
HIS ESCAPE HAD HE BRIBED THE AGENT WHY DID THIS MAN GIVE NO SIGN OF
LIFE TO MARIUS WHO OWED EVERYTHING TO HIM HIS DISINTERESTEDNESS WAS NO
LESS TREMENDOUS THAN HIS DEVOTION
WHY HAD NOT THAT MAN APPEARED AGAIN
PERHAPS HE WAS ABOVE COMPENSATION BUT NO ONE IS ABOVE GRATITUDE
WAS HE
DEAD WHO WAS THE MAN WHAT SORT OF A FACE HAD HE NO ONE COULD TELL HIM
THIS
THE COACHMAN ANSWERED THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK BASQUE AND NICOLETTE
ALL IN A FLUTTER HAD LOOKED ONLY AT THEIR YOUNG MASTER ALL COVERED WITH
BLOOD
THE PORTER WHOSE CANDLE HAD LIGHTED THE TRAGIC ARRIVAL OF MARIUS HAD
BEEN THE ONLY ONE TO TAKE NOTE OF THE MAN IN QUESTION AND THIS IS THE
DESCRIPTION THAT HE GAVE
THAT MAN WAS TERRIBLE
MARIUS HAD THE BLOOD STAINED CLOTHING WHICH HE HAD WORN WHEN HE HAD BEEN
BROUGHT BACK TO HIS GRANDFATHER PRESERVED IN THE HOPE THAT IT WOULD
PROVE OF SERVICE IN HIS RESEARCHES
ON EXAMINING THE COAT IT WAS FOUND THAT ONE SKIRT HAD BEEN TORN IN A
SINGULAR WAY
A PIECE WAS MISSING
ONE EVENING MARIUS WAS SPEAKING IN THE PRESENCE OF COSETTE AND JEAN
VALJEAN OF THE WHOLE OF THAT SINGULAR ADVENTURE OF THE INNUMERABLE
INQUIRIES WHICH HE HAD MADE AND OF THE FRUITLESSNESS OF HIS EFFORTS
THE COLD COUNTENANCE OF MONSIEUR FAUCHELEVENT ANGERED HIM
HE EXCLAIMED WITH A VIVACITY WHICH HAD SOMETHING OF WRATH IN IT
YES THAT MAN WHOEVER HE MAY HAVE BEEN WAS SUBLIME
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HE DID SIR HE INTERVENED LIKE AN ARCHANGEL
HE MUST HAVE FLUNG HIMSELF
INTO THE MIDST OF THE BATTLE HAVE STOLEN ME AWAY HAVE OPENED THE
SEWER HAVE DRAGGED ME INTO IT AND HAVE CARRIED ME THROUGH IT HE
MUST HAVE TRAVERSED MORE THAN A LEAGUE AND A HALF IN THOSE FRIGHTFUL
SUBTERRANEAN GALLERIES BENT OVER WEIGHED DOWN IN THE DARK IN THE
CESS POOL MORE THAN A LEAGUE AND A HALF SIR WITH A CORPSE UPON HIS
BACK AND WITH WHAT OBJECT WITH THE SOLE OBJECT OF SAVING THE CORPSE
AND THAT CORPSE I WAS
HE SAID TO HIMSELF 'THERE MAY STILL BE A
GLIMPSE OF LIFE THERE PERCHANCE I WILL RISK MY OWN EXISTENCE FOR THAT
MISERABLE SPARK AND HIS EXISTENCE HE RISKED NOT ONCE BUT TWENTY TIMES
AND EVERY STEP WAS A DANGER
THE PROOF OF IT IS THAT ON EMERGING FROM
THE SEWER HE WAS ARRESTED
DO YOU KNOW SIR THAT THAT MAN DID ALL
THIS AND HE HAD NO RECOMPENSE TO EXPECT
WHAT WAS I AN INSURGENT
WHAT WAS I ONE OF THE CONQUERED
OH IF COSETTE'S SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
FRANCS WERE MINE
THEY ARE YOURS INTERRUPTED JEAN VALJEAN
WELL RESUMED MARIUS I WOULD GIVE THEM ALL TO FIND THAT MAN ONCE
MORE
JEAN VALJEAN REMAINED SILENT
BOOK SIXTH THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT
CHAPTER I THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY 1833
THE NIGHT OF THE 16TH TO THE 17TH OF FEBRUARY 1833 WAS A BLESSED
NIGHT
ABOVE ITS SHADOWS HEAVEN STOOD OPEN
IT WAS THE WEDDING NIGHT OF
MARIUS AND COSETTE
THE DAY HAD BEEN ADORABLE
IT HAD NOT BEEN THE GRAND FESTIVAL DREAMED BY THE GRANDFATHER A FAIRY
SPECTACLE WITH A CONFUSION OF CHERUBIM AND CUPIDS OVER THE HEADS OF THE
BRIDAL PAIR A MARRIAGE WORTHY TO FORM THE SUBJECT OF A PAINTING TO BE
PLACED OVER A DOOR BUT IT HAD BEEN SWEET AND SMILING
THE MANNER OF MARRIAGE IN 1833 WAS NOT THE SAME AS IT IS TO DAY
FRANCE
HAD NOT YET BORROWED FROM ENGLAND THAT SUPREME DELICACY OF CARRYING OFF
ONE'S WIFE OF FLEEING ON COMING OUT OF CHURCH OF HIDING ONESELF WITH
SHAME FROM ONE'S HAPPINESS AND OF COMBINING THE WAYS OF A BANKRUPT WITH
THE DELIGHTS OF THE SONG OF SONGS
PEOPLE HAD NOT YET GRASPED TO THE
FULL THE CHASTITY EXQUISITENESS AND DECENCY OF JOLTING THEIR PARADISE
IN A POSTING CHAISE OF BREAKING UP THEIR MYSTERY WITH CLIC CLACS OF
TAKING FOR A NUPTIAL BED THE BED OF AN INN AND OF LEAVING BEHIND THEM
IN A COMMONPLACE CHAMBER AT SUCH A NIGHT THE MOST SACRED OF
THE SOUVENIRS OF LIFE MINGLED PELL MELL WITH THE TETE A TETE OF THE
CONDUCTOR OF THE DILIGENCE AND THE MAID SERVANT OF THE INN
IN THIS SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN WHICH WE ARE NOW
LIVING THE MAYOR AND HIS SCARF THE PRIEST AND HIS CHASUBLE THE LAW
AND GOD NO LONGER SUFFICE THEY MUST BE EKED OUT BY THE POSTILION DE
LONJUMEAU A BLUE WAISTCOAT TURNED UP WITH RED AND WITH BELL BUTTONS
A PLAQUE LIKE A VANTBRACE KNEE BREECHES OF GREEN LEATHER OATHS TO THE
NORMAN HORSES WITH THEIR TAILS KNOTTED UP FALSE GALLOONS VARNISHED
HAT LONG POWDERED LOCKS AN ENORMOUS WHIP AND TALL BOOTS
FRANCE DOES
NOT YET CARRY ELEGANCE TO THE LENGTH OF DOING LIKE THE ENGLISH NOBILITY
AND RAINING DOWN ON THE POST CHAISE OF THE BRIDAL PAIR A HAIL STORM
OF SLIPPERS TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND OF WORN OUT SHOES IN MEMORY OF
CHURCHILL AFTERWARDS MARLBOROUGH OR MALBROUCK WHO WAS ASSAILED ON
HIS WEDDING DAY BY THE WRATH OF AN AUNT WHICH BROUGHT HIM GOOD LUCK
OLD SHOES AND SLIPPERS DO NOT AS YET FORM A PART OF OUR NUPTIAL
CELEBRATIONS BUT PATIENCE AS GOOD TASTE CONTINUES TO SPREAD WE SHALL
COME TO THAT
IN 1833 A HUNDRED YEARS AGO MARRIAGE WAS NOT CONDUCTED AT A FULL TROT
STRANGE TO SAY AT THAT EPOCH PEOPLE STILL IMAGINED THAT A WEDDING WAS
A PRIVATE AND SOCIAL FESTIVAL THAT A PATRIARCHAL BANQUET DOES NOT
SPOIL A DOMESTIC SOLEMNITY THAT GAYETY EVEN IN EXCESS PROVIDED IT BE
HONEST AND DECENT DOES HAPPINESS NO HARM AND THAT IN SHORT IT IS A
GOOD AND A VENERABLE THING THAT THE FUSION OF THESE TWO DESTINIES WHENCE
A FAMILY IS DESTINED TO SPRING SHOULD BEGIN AT HOME AND THAT THE
HOUSEHOLD SHOULD THENCEFORTH HAVE ITS NUPTIAL CHAMBER AS ITS WITNESS
AND PEOPLE WERE SO IMMODEST AS TO MARRY IN THEIR OWN HOMES
THE MARRIAGE TOOK PLACE THEREFORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NOW
SUPERANNUATED FASHION AT M
GILLENORMAND'S HOUSE
NATURAL AND COMMONPLACE AS THIS MATTER OF MARRYING IS THE BANNS TO
PUBLISH THE PAPERS TO BE DRAWN UP THE MAYORALTY AND THE CHURCH
PRODUCE SOME COMPLICATION
THEY COULD NOT GET READY BEFORE THE 16TH OF
FEBRUARY
NOW WE NOTE THIS DETAIL FOR THE PURE SATISFACTION OF BEING EXACT IT
CHANCED THAT THE 16TH FELL ON SHROVE TUESDAY
HESITATIONS SCRUPLES
PARTICULARLY ON THE PART OF AUNT GILLENORMAND
SHROVE TUESDAY EXCLAIMED THE GRANDFATHER SO MUCH THE BETTER
THERE
IS A PROVERB
'MARIAGE UN MARDI GRAS
N'AURA POINT ENFANTS INGRATS 66
LET US PROCEED
HERE GOES FOR THE 16TH DO YOU WANT TO DELAY MARIUS
NO CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED THE LOVER
LET US MARRY THEN CRIED THE GRANDFATHER
ACCORDINGLY THE MARRIAGE TOOK PLACE ON THE 16TH NOTWITHSTANDING THE
PUBLIC MERRYMAKING
IT RAINED THAT DAY BUT THERE IS ALWAYS IN THE SKY
A TINY SCRAP OF BLUE AT THE SERVICE OF HAPPINESS WHICH LOVERS SEE EVEN
WHEN THE REST OF CREATION IS UNDER AN UMBRELLA
ON THE PRECEDING EVENING JEAN VALJEAN HANDED TO MARIUS IN THE PRESENCE
OF M
GILLENORMAND THE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS
AS THE MARRIAGE WAS TAKING PLACE UNDER THE REGIME OF COMMUNITY OF
PROPERTY THE PAPERS HAD BEEN SIMPLE
HENCEFORTH TOUSSAINT WAS OF NO USE TO JEAN VALJEAN COSETTE INHERITED
HER AND PROMOTED HER TO THE RANK OF LADY'S MAID
AS FOR JEAN VALJEAN A BEAUTIFUL CHAMBER IN THE GILLENORMAND HOUSE HAD
BEEN FURNISHED EXPRESSLY FOR HIM AND COSETTE HAD SAID TO HIM IN SUCH
AN IRRESISTIBLE MANNER FATHER I ENTREAT YOU THAT SHE HAD ALMOST
PERSUADED HIM TO PROMISE THAT HE WOULD COME AND OCCUPY IT
A FEW DAYS BEFORE THAT FIXED ON FOR THE MARRIAGE AN ACCIDENT HAPPENED
TO JEAN VALJEAN HE CRUSHED THE THUMB OF HIS RIGHT HAND
THIS WAS NOT A
SERIOUS MATTER AND HE HAD NOT ALLOWED ANY ONE TO TROUBLE HIMSELF
ABOUT IT NOR TO DRESS IT NOR EVEN TO SEE HIS HURT NOT EVEN COSETTE
NEVERTHELESS THIS HAD FORCED HIM TO SWATHE HIS HAND IN A LINEN BANDAGE
AND TO CARRY HIS ARM IN A SLING AND HAD PREVENTED HIS SIGNING
M
GILLENORMAND IN HIS CAPACITY OF COSETTE'S SUPERVISING GUARDIAN HAD
SUPPLIED HIS PLACE
WE WILL NOT CONDUCT THE READER EITHER TO THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OR TO THE
CHURCH
ONE DOES NOT FOLLOW A PAIR OF LOVERS TO THAT EXTENT AND ONE IS
ACCUSTOMED TO TURN ONE'S BACK ON THE DRAMA AS SOON AS IT PUTS A WEDDING
NOSEGAY IN ITS BUTTONHOLE
WE WILL CONFINE OURSELVES TO NOTING AN
INCIDENT WHICH THOUGH UNNOTICED BY THE WEDDING PARTY MARKED THE
TRANSIT FROM THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE TO THE CHURCH OF SAINT PAUL
AT THAT EPOCH THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE RUE SAINT LOUIS WAS IN
PROCESS OF REPAVING
IT WAS BARRED OFF BEGINNING WITH THE RUE DU
PARE ROYAL
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE WEDDING CARRIAGES TO GO DIRECTLY
TO SAINT PAUL
THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ALTER THEIR COURSE AND THE SIMPLEST
WAY WAS TO TURN THROUGH THE BOULEVARD
ONE OF THE INVITED GUESTS
OBSERVED THAT IT WAS SHROVE TUESDAY AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A JAM
OF VEHICLES WHY ASKED M
GILLENORMAND BECAUSE OF THE
MASKERS CAPITAL SAID THE GRANDFATHER LET US GO THAT WAY
THESE
YOUNG FOLKS ARE ON THE WAY TO BE MARRIED THEY ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE
SERIOUS PART OF LIFE
THIS WILL PREPARE THEM FOR SEEING A BIT OF THE
MASQUERADE
THEY WENT BY WAY OF THE BOULEVARD
THE FIRST WEDDING COACH HELD COSETTE
AND AUNT GILLENORMAND M
GILLENORMAND AND JEAN VALJEAN
MARIUS STILL
SEPARATED FROM HIS BETROTHED ACCORDING TO USAGE DID NOT COME UNTIL
THE SECOND
THE NUPTIAL TRAIN ON EMERGING FROM THE RUE DES
FILLES DU CALVAIRE BECAME ENTANGLED IN A LONG PROCESSION OF VEHICLES
WHICH FORMED AN ENDLESS CHAIN FROM THE MADELEINE TO THE BASTILLE AND
FROM THE BASTILLE TO THE MADELEINE
MASKERS ABOUNDED ON THE BOULEVARD
IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS RAINING AT INTERVALS MERRY ANDREW
PANTALOON AND CLOWN PERSISTED
IN THE GOOD HUMOR OF THAT WINTER OF 1833
PARIS HAD DISGUISED ITSELF AS VENICE
SUCH SHROVE TUESDAYS ARE NO
LONGER TO BE SEEN NOW A DAYS
EVERYTHING WHICH EXISTS BEING A SCATTERED
CARNIVAL THERE IS NO LONGER ANY CARNIVAL
THE SIDEWALKS WERE OVERFLOWING WITH PEDESTRIANS AND THE WINDOWS WITH
CURIOUS SPECTATORS
THE TERRACES WHICH CROWN THE PERISTYLES OF THE
THEATRES WERE BORDERED WITH SPECTATORS
BESIDES THE MASKERS THEY STARED
AT THAT PROCESSION PECULIAR TO SHROVE TUESDAY AS TO LONGCHAMPS OF
VEHICLES OF EVERY DESCRIPTION CITADINES TAPISSIERES CARIOLES
CABRIOLETS MARCHING IN ORDER RIGOROUSLY RIVETED TO EACH OTHER BY THE
POLICE REGULATIONS AND LOCKED INTO RAILS AS IT WERE
ANY ONE IN
THESE VEHICLES IS AT ONCE A SPECTATOR AND A SPECTACLE
POLICE SERGEANTS
MAINTAINED ON THE SIDES OF THE BOULEVARD THESE TWO INTERMINABLE
PARALLEL FILES MOVING IN CONTRARY DIRECTIONS AND SAW TO IT THAT
NOTHING INTERFERED WITH THAT DOUBLE CURRENT THOSE TWO BROOKS OF
CARRIAGES FLOWING THE ONE DOWN STREAM THE OTHER UP STREAM THE
ONE TOWARDS THE CHAUSSEE D'ANTIN THE OTHER TOWARDS THE FAUBOURG
SAINT ANTOINE
THE CARRIAGES OF THE PEERS OF FRANCE AND OF THE
AMBASSADORS EMBLAZONED WITH COATS OF ARMS HELD THE MIDDLE OF THE WAY
GOING AND COMING FREELY
CERTAIN JOYOUS AND MAGNIFICENT TRAINS NOTABLY
THAT OF THE BOEUF GRAS HAD THE SAME PRIVILEGE
IN THIS GAYETY OF PARIS
ENGLAND CRACKED HER WHIP LORD SEYMOUR'S POST CHAISE HARASSED BY A
NICKNAME FROM THE POPULACE PASSED WITH GREAT NOISE
IN THE DOUBLE FILE ALONG WHICH THE MUNICIPAL GUARDS GALLOPED LIKE
SHEEP DOGS HONEST FAMILY COACHES LOADED DOWN WITH GREAT AUNTS AND
GRANDMOTHERS DISPLAYED AT THEIR DOORS FRESH GROUPS OF CHILDREN IN
DISGUISE CLOWNS OF SEVEN YEARS OF AGE COLUMBINES OF SIX RAVISHING
LITTLE CREATURES WHO FELT THAT THEY FORMED AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE
PUBLIC MIRTH WHO WERE IMBUED WITH THE DIGNITY OF THEIR HARLEQUINADE
AND WHO POSSESSED THE GRAVITY OF FUNCTIONARIES
FROM TIME TO TIME A HITCH AROSE SOMEWHERE IN THE PROCESSION OF
VEHICLES ONE OR OTHER OF THE TWO LATERAL FILES HALTED UNTIL THE KNOT
WAS DISENTANGLED ONE CARRIAGE DELAYED SUFFICED TO PARALYZE THE WHOLE
LINE
THEN THEY SET OUT AGAIN ON THE MARCH
THE WEDDING CARRIAGES WERE IN THE FILE PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BASTILLE
AND SKIRTING THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD
AT THE TOP OF THE
PONT AUX CHOUX THERE WAS A STOPPAGE
NEARLY AT THE SAME MOMENT THE
OTHER FILE WHICH WAS PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE MADELEINE HALTED ALSO
AT
THAT POINT OF THE FILE THERE WAS A CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKERS
THESE CARRIAGES OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY THESE WAGON LOADS OF
MASKERS ARE VERY FAMILIAR TO PARISIANS
IF THEY WERE MISSING ON A SHROVE
TUESDAY OR AT THE MID LENT IT WOULD BE TAKEN IN BAD PART AND PEOPLE
WOULD SAY THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND THAT
PROBABLY THE MINISTRY
IS ABOUT TO UNDERGO A CHANGE A PILE OF CASSANDRAS HARLEQUINS AND
COLUMBINES JOLTED ALONG HIGH ABOVE THE PASSERS BY ALL POSSIBLE
GROTESQUENESSES FROM THE TURK TO THE SAVAGE HERCULES SUPPORTING
MARQUISES FISHWIVES WHO WOULD HAVE MADE RABELAIS STOP UP HIS EARS JUST
AS THE MAENADS MADE ARISTOPHANES DROP HIS EYES TOW WIGS PINK TIGHTS
DANDIFIED HATS SPECTACLES OF A GRIMACER THREE CORNERED HATS OF JANOT
TORMENTED WITH A BUTTERFLY SHOUTS DIRECTED AT PEDESTRIANS FISTS ON
HIPS BOLD ATTITUDES BARE SHOULDERS IMMODESTY UNCHAINED A CHAOS OF
SHAMELESSNESS DRIVEN BY A COACHMAN CROWNED WITH FLOWERS THIS IS WHAT
THAT INSTITUTION WAS LIKE
GREECE STOOD IN NEED OF THE CHARIOT OF THESPIS FRANCE STANDS IN NEED OF
THE HACKNEY COACH OF VADE
EVERYTHING CAN BE PARODIED EVEN PARODY
THE SATURNALIA THAT GRIMACE OF
ANTIQUE BEAUTY ENDS THROUGH EXAGGERATION AFTER EXAGGERATION IN SHROVE
TUESDAY AND THE BACCHANAL FORMERLY CROWNED WITH SPRAYS OF VINE LEAVES
AND GRAPES INUNDATED WITH SUNSHINE DISPLAYING HER MARBLE BREAST IN A
DIVINE SEMI NUDITY HAVING AT THE PRESENT DAY LOST HER SHAPE UNDER
THE SOAKED RAGS OF THE NORTH HAS FINALLY COME TO BE CALLED THE
JACK PUDDING
THE TRADITION OF CARRIAGE LOADS OF MASKERS RUNS BACK TO THE MOST ANCIENT
DAYS OF THE MONARCHY
THE ACCOUNTS OF LOUIS XI
ALLOT TO THE BAILIFF OF
THE PALACE TWENTY SOUS TOURNOIS FOR THREE COACHES OF MASCARADES
IN THE CROSS ROADS IN OUR DAY THESE NOISY HEAPS OF CREATURES ARE
ACCUSTOMED TO HAVE THEMSELVES DRIVEN IN SOME ANCIENT CUCKOO CARRIAGE
WHOSE IMPERIAL THEY LOAD DOWN OR THEY OVERWHELM A HIRED LANDAU WITH
ITS TOP THROWN BACK WITH THEIR TUMULTUOUS GROUPS
TWENTY OF THEM RIDE
IN A CARRIAGE INTENDED FOR SIX
THEY CLING TO THE SEATS TO THE RUMBLE
ON THE CHEEKS OF THE HOOD ON THE SHAFTS
THEY EVEN BESTRIDE THE
CARRIAGE LAMPS
THEY STAND SIT LIE WITH THEIR KNEES DRAWN UP IN A
KNOT AND THEIR LEGS HANGING
THE WOMEN SIT ON THE MEN'S LAPS
FAR
AWAY ABOVE THE THRONG OF HEADS THEIR WILD PYRAMID IS VISIBLE
THESE
CARRIAGE LOADS FORM MOUNTAINS OF MIRTH IN THE MIDST OF THE ROUT
COLLE
PANARD AND PIRON FLOW FROM IT ENRICHED WITH SLANG
THIS CARRIAGE WHICH
HAS BECOME COLOSSAL THROUGH ITS FREIGHT HAS AN AIR OF CONQUEST
UPROAR
REIGNS IN FRONT TUMULT BEHIND
PEOPLE VOCIFERATE SHOUT HOWL THERE
THEY BREAK FORTH AND WRITHE WITH ENJOYMENT GAYETY ROARS SARCASM FLAMES
FORTH JOVIALITY IS FLAUNTED LIKE A RED FLAG TWO JADES THERE DRAG FARCE
BLOSSOMED FORTH INTO AN APOTHEOSIS IT IS THE TRIUMPHAL CAR OF LAUGHTER
A LAUGHTER THAT IS TOO CYNICAL TO BE FRANK
IN TRUTH THIS LAUGHTER IS
SUSPICIOUS
THIS LAUGHTER HAS A MISSION
IT IS CHARGED WITH PROVING THE
CARNIVAL TO THE PARISIANS
THESE FISHWIFE VEHICLES IN WHICH ONE FEELS ONE KNOWS NOT WHAT SHADOWS
SET THE PHILOSOPHER TO THINKING
THERE IS GOVERNMENT THEREIN
THERE ONE
LAYS ONE'S FINGER ON A MYSTERIOUS AFFINITY BETWEEN PUBLIC MEN AND PUBLIC
WOMEN
IT CERTAINLY IS SAD THAT TURPITUDE HEAPED UP SHOULD GIVE A SUM TOTAL
OF GAYETY THAT BY PILING IGNOMINY UPON OPPROBRIUM THE PEOPLE SHOULD
BE ENTICED THAT THE SYSTEM OF SPYING AND SERVING AS CARYATIDS TO
PROSTITUTION SHOULD AMUSE THE RABBLE WHEN IT CONFRONTS THEM THAT THE
CROWD LOVES TO BEHOLD THAT MONSTROUS LIVING PILE OF TINSEL RAGS HALF
DUNG HALF LIGHT ROLL BY ON FOUR WHEELS HOWLING AND LAUGHING THAT THEY
SHOULD CLAP THEIR HANDS AT THIS GLORY COMPOSED OF ALL SHAMES THAT THERE
WOULD BE NO FESTIVAL FOR THE POPULACE DID NOT THE POLICE PROMENADE IN
THEIR MIDST THESE SORTS OF TWENTY HEADED HYDRAS OF JOY
BUT WHAT CAN BE
DONE ABOUT IT THESE BE RIBBONED AND BE FLOWERED TUMBRILS OF MIRE ARE
INSULTED AND PARDONED BY THE LAUGHTER OF THE PUBLIC
THE LAUGHTER OF ALL
IS THE ACCOMPLICE OF UNIVERSAL DEGRADATION
CERTAIN UNHEALTHY FESTIVALS
DISAGGREGATE THE PEOPLE AND CONVERT THEM INTO THE POPULACE
AND
POPULACES LIKE TYRANTS REQUIRE BUFFOONS
THE KING HAS ROQUELAURE
THE POPULACE HAS THE MERRY ANDREW
PARIS IS A GREAT MAD CITY ON EVERY
OCCASION THAT IT IS A GREAT SUBLIME CITY
THERE THE CARNIVAL FORMS
PART OF POLITICS
PARIS LET US CONFESS IT WILLINGLY ALLOWS INFAMY TO
FURNISH IT WITH COMEDY
SHE ONLY DEMANDS OF HER MASTERS WHEN SHE HAS
MASTERS ONE THING PAINT ME THE MUD ROME WAS OF THE SAME MIND
SHE
LOVED NERO
NERO WAS A TITANIC LIGHTERMAN
CHANCE ORDAINED AS WE HAVE JUST SAID THAT ONE OF THESE SHAPELESS
CLUSTERS OF MASKED MEN AND WOMEN DRAGGED ABOUT ON A VAST CALASH SHOULD
HALT ON THE LEFT OF THE BOULEVARD WHILE THE WEDDING TRAIN HALTED ON THE
RIGHT
THE CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKS CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE WEDDING CARRIAGE
CONTAINING THE BRIDAL PARTY OPPOSITE THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
BOULEVARD
HULLO SAID A MASKER HERE'S A WEDDING
A SHAM WEDDING RETORTED ANOTHER
WE ARE THE GENUINE ARTICLE
AND BEING TOO FAR OFF TO ACCOST THE WEDDING PARTY AND FEARING ALSO
THE REBUKE OF THE POLICE THE TWO MASKERS TURNED THEIR EYES ELSEWHERE
AT THE END OF ANOTHER MINUTE THE CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKERS HAD THEIR
HANDS FULL THE MULTITUDE SET TO YELLING WHICH IS THE CROWD'S CARESS
TO MASQUERADES AND THE TWO MASKERS WHO HAD JUST SPOKEN HAD TO FACE THE
THRONG WITH THEIR COMRADES AND DID NOT FIND THE ENTIRE REPERTORY OF
PROJECTILES OF THE FISHMARKETS TOO EXTENSIVE TO RETORT TO THE ENORMOUS
VERBAL ATTACKS OF THE POPULACE
A FRIGHTFUL EXCHANGE OF METAPHORS TOOK
PLACE BETWEEN THE MASKERS AND THE CROWD
IN THE MEANWHILE TWO OTHER MASKERS IN THE SAME CARRIAGE A SPANIARD
WITH AN ENORMOUS NOSE AN ELDERLY AIR AND HUGE BLACK MOUSTACHE AND A
GAUNT FISHWIFE WHO WAS QUITE A YOUNG GIRL MASKED WITH A LOUP 67 HAD
ALSO NOTICED THE WEDDING AND WHILE THEIR COMPANIONS AND THE PASSERS BY
WERE EXCHANGING INSULTS THEY HAD HELD A DIALOGUE IN A LOW VOICE
THEIR ASIDE WAS COVERED BY THE TUMULT AND WAS LOST IN IT
THE GUSTS OF
RAIN HAD DRENCHED THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WHICH WAS WIDE OPEN THE
BREEZES OF FEBRUARY ARE NOT WARM AS THE FISHWIFE CLAD IN A LOW NECKED
GOWN REPLIED TO THE SPANIARD SHE SHIVERED LAUGHED AND COUGHED
HERE IS THEIR DIALOGUE
SAY NOW
WHAT DADDY
DO YOU SEE THAT OLD COVE
WHAT OLD COVE
YONDER IN THE FIRST WEDDING CART ON OUR SIDE
THE ONE WITH HIS ARM HUNG UP IN A BLACK CRAVAT
YES
WELL
I'M SURE THAT I KNOW HIM
AH
I'M WILLING THAT THEY SHOULD CUT MY THROAT AND I'M READY TO SWEAR THAT
I NEVER SAID EITHER YOU THOU OR I IN MY LIFE IF I DON'T KNOW THAT
PARISIAN PANTINOIS
PARIS IN PANTIN TO DAY
CAN YOU SEE THE BRIDE IF YOU STOOP DOWN
NO
AND THE BRIDEGROOM
THERE'S NO BRIDEGROOM IN THAT TRAP
BAH
UNLESS IT'S THE OLD FELLOW
TRY TO GET A SIGHT OF THE BRIDE BY STOOPING VERY LOW
I CAN'T
NEVER MIND THAT OLD COVE WHO HAS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH HIS PAW I
KNOW AND THAT I'M POSITIVE
AND WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO KNOW HIM
NO ONE CAN TELL
SOMETIMES IT DOES
I DON'T CARE A HANG FOR OLD FELLOWS THAT I DON'T
I KNOW HIM
KNOW HIM IF YOU WANT TO
HOW THE DEVIL DOES HE COME TO BE ONE OF THE WEDDING PARTY
WE ARE IN IT TOO
WHERE DOES THAT WEDDING COME FROM
HOW SHOULD I KNOW
LISTEN
WELL WHAT
THERE'S ONE THING YOU OUGHT TO DO
WHAT'S THAT
GET OFF OF OUR TRAP AND SPIN THAT WEDDING
WHAT FOR
TO FIND OUT WHERE IT GOES AND WHAT IT IS
HURRY UP AND JUMP DOWN
TROT MY GIRL YOUR LEGS ARE YOUNG
I CAN'T QUIT THE VEHICLE
WHY NOT
I'M HIRED
AH THE DEVIL
I OWE MY FISHWIFE DAY TO THE PREFECTURE
THAT'S TRUE
IF I LEAVE THE CART THE FIRST INSPECTOR WHO GETS HIS EYE ON ME WILL
ARREST ME
YOU KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH
YES I DO
I'M BOUGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR TO DAY
ALL THE SAME THAT OLD FELLOW BOTHERS ME
DO THE OLD FELLOWS BOTHER YOU BUT YOU'RE NOT A YOUNG GIRL
HE'S IN THE FIRST CARRIAGE
WELL
IN THE BRIDE'S TRAP
WHAT THEN
SO HE IS THE FATHER
WHAT CONCERN IS THAT OF MINE
I TELL YOU THAT HE'S THE FATHER
AS IF HE WERE THE ONLY FATHER
LISTEN
WHAT
I CAN'T GO OUT OTHERWISE THAN MASKED
HERE I'M CONCEALED NO ONE KNOWS
THAT I'M HERE
BUT TO MORROW THERE WILL BE NO MORE MASKERS
IT'S ASH
WEDNESDAY
I RUN THE RISK OF BEING NABBED
I MUST SNEAK BACK INTO MY
HOLE
BUT YOU ARE FREE
NOT PARTICULARLY
MORE THAN I AM AT ANY RATE
WELL WHAT OF THAT
YOU MUST TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT WEDDING PARTY WENT TO
WHERE IT WENT
YES
I KNOW
WHERE IS IT GOING THEN
TO THE CADRAN BLEU
IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S NOT IN THAT DIRECTION
WELL TO LA RAPEE
OR ELSEWHERE
IT'S FREE
WEDDING PARTIES ARE AT LIBERTY
THAT'S NOT THE POINT AT ALL
I TELL YOU THAT YOU MUST TRY TO LEARN FOR
ME WHAT THAT WEDDING IS WHO THAT OLD COVE BELONGS TO AND WHERE THAT
WEDDING PAIR LIVES
I LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE QUEER
IT'S SO EASY TO FIND OUT A
WEDDING PARTY THAT PASSED THROUGH THE STREET ON A SHROVE TUESDAY A WEEK
AFTERWARDS
A PIN IN A HAY MOW IT AIN'T POSSIBLE
THAT DON'T MATTER
YOU MUST TRY
YOU UNDERSTAND ME AZELMA
THE TWO FILES RESUMED THEIR MOVEMENT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BOULEVARD IN
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND THE CARRIAGE OF THE MASKERS LOST SIGHT OF THE
TRAP OF THE BRIDE
CHAPTER II JEAN VALJEAN STILL WEARS HIS ARM IN A SLING
TO REALIZE ONE'S DREAM
TO WHOM IS THIS ACCORDED THERE MUST BE
ELECTIONS FOR THIS IN HEAVEN WE ARE ALL CANDIDATES UNKNOWN TO
OURSELVES THE ANGELS VOTE
COSETTE AND MARIUS HAD BEEN ELECTED
COSETTE BOTH AT THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND AT CHURCH WAS DAZZLING AND
TOUCHING
TOUSSAINT ASSISTED BY NICOLETTE HAD DRESSED HER
COSETTE WORE OVER A PETTICOAT OF WHITE TAFFETA HER ROBE OF BINCHE
GUIPURE A VEIL OF ENGLISH POINT A NECKLACE OF FINE PEARLS A WREATH
OF ORANGE FLOWERS ALL THIS WAS WHITE AND FROM THE MIDST OF THAT
WHITENESS SHE BEAMED FORTH
IT WAS AN EXQUISITE CANDOR EXPANDING AND
BECOMING TRANSFIGURED IN THE LIGHT
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HER A
VIRGIN ON THE POINT OF TURNING INTO A GODDESS
MARIUS' HANDSOME HAIR WAS LUSTROUS AND PERFUMED HERE AND THERE BENEATH
THE THICK CURLS PALE LINES THE SCARS OF THE BARRICADE WERE VISIBLE
THE GRANDFATHER HAUGHTY WITH HEAD HELD HIGH AMALGAMATING MORE THAN
EVER IN HIS TOILET AND HIS MANNERS ALL THE ELEGANCES OF THE EPOCH OF
BARRAS ESCORTED COSETTE
HE TOOK THE PLACE OF JEAN VALJEAN WHO ON
ACCOUNT OF HIS ARM BEING STILL IN A SLING COULD NOT GIVE HIS HAND TO
THE BRIDE
JEAN VALJEAN DRESSED IN BLACK FOLLOWED THEM WITH A SMILE
MONSIEUR FAUCHELEVENT SAID THE GRANDFATHER TO HIM THIS IS A FINE
DAY
I VOTE FOR THE END OF AFFLICTIONS AND SORROWS
HENCEFORTH THERE
MUST BE NO SADNESS ANYWHERE
PARDIEU I DECREE JOY EVIL HAS NO RIGHT TO
EXIST
THAT THERE SHOULD BE ANY UNHAPPY MEN IS IN SOOTH A DISGRACE
TO THE AZURE OF THE SKY
EVIL DOES NOT COME FROM MAN WHO IS GOOD AT
BOTTOM
ALL HUMAN MISERIES HAVE FOR THEIR CAPITAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
HELL OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE DEVIL'S TUILERIES
GOOD HERE I AM
UTTERING DEMAGOGICAL WORDS AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I HAVE NO LONGER
ANY POLITICAL OPINIONS LET ALL ME BE RICH THAT IS TO SAY MIRTHFUL
AND I CONFINE MYSELF TO THAT
WHEN AT THE CONCLUSION OF ALL THE CEREMONIES AFTER HAVING PRONOUNCED
BEFORE THE MAYOR AND BEFORE THE PRIEST ALL POSSIBLE YESSES AFTER
HAVING SIGNED THE REGISTERS AT THE MUNICIPALITY AND AT THE SACRISTY
AFTER HAVING EXCHANGED THEIR RINGS AFTER HAVING KNELT SIDE BY SIDE
UNDER THE PALL OF WHITE MOIRE IN THE SMOKE OF THE CENSER THEY ARRIVED
HAND IN HAND ADMIRED AND ENVIED BY ALL MARIUS IN BLACK SHE IN WHITE
PRECEDED BY THE SUISSE WITH THE EPAULETS OF A COLONEL TAPPING THE
PAVEMENT WITH HIS HALBERD BETWEEN TWO ROWS OF ASTONISHED SPECTATORS AT
THE PORTALS OF THE CHURCH BOTH LEAVES OF WHICH WERE THROWN WIDE OPEN
READY TO ENTER THEIR CARRIAGE AGAIN AND ALL BEING FINISHED COSETTE
STILL COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WAS REAL
SHE LOOKED AT MARIUS SHE
LOOKED AT THE CROWD SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE
FEARED THAT SHE SHOULD WAKE UP FROM HER DREAM
HER AMAZED AND UNEASY AIR
ADDED SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY ENCHANTING TO HER BEAUTY
THEY ENTERED THE
SAME CARRIAGE TO RETURN HOME MARIUS BESIDE COSETTE M
GILLENORMAND
AND JEAN VALJEAN SAT OPPOSITE THEM AUNT GILLENORMAND HAD WITHDRAWN ONE
DEGREE AND WAS IN THE SECOND VEHICLE
MY CHILDREN SAID THE GRANDFATHER HERE YOU ARE MONSIEUR LE BARON
AND MADAME LA BARONNE WITH AN INCOME OF THIRTY THOUSAND LIVRES
AND COSETTE NESTLING CLOSE TO MARIUS CARESSED HIS EAR WITH AN ANGELIC
WHISPER SO IT IS TRUE
MY NAME IS MARIUS
I AM MADAME THOU
THESE TWO CREATURES WERE RESPLENDENT
THEY HAD REACHED THAT IRREVOCABLE
AND IRRECOVERABLE MOMENT AT THE DAZZLING INTERSECTION OF ALL YOUTH AND
ALL JOY
THEY REALIZED THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIRE THEY WERE FORTY
YEARS OLD TAKEN TOGETHER
IT WAS MARRIAGE SUBLIMATED THESE TWO CHILDREN
WERE TWO LILIES
THEY DID NOT SEE EACH OTHER THEY DID NOT CONTEMPLATE
EACH OTHER
COSETTE PERCEIVED MARIUS IN THE MIDST OF A GLORY MARIUS
PERCEIVED COSETTE ON AN ALTAR
AND ON THAT ALTAR AND IN THAT GLORY THE
TWO APOTHEOSES MINGLING IN THE BACKGROUND ONE KNOWS NOT HOW BEHIND A
CLOUD FOR COSETTE IN A FLASH FOR MARIUS THERE WAS THE IDEAL THING THE
REAL THING THE MEETING OF THE KISS AND THE DREAM THE NUPTIAL PILLOW
ALL THE TORMENTS THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD PASSED CAME BACK TO THEM IN
INTOXICATION
IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THEIR SORROWS THEIR SLEEPLESS
NIGHTS THEIR TEARS THEIR ANGUISH THEIR TERRORS THEIR DESPAIR
CONVERTED INTO CARESSES AND RAYS OF LIGHT RENDERED STILL MORE CHARMING
THE CHARMING HOUR WHICH WAS APPROACHING AND THAT THEIR GRIEFS WERE BUT
SO MANY HANDMAIDENS WHO WERE PREPARING THE TOILET OF JOY
HOW GOOD IT IS
TO HAVE SUFFERED THEIR UNHAPPINESS FORMED A HALO ROUND THEIR HAPPINESS
THE LONG AGONY OF THEIR LOVE WAS TERMINATING IN AN ASCENSION
IT WAS THE SAME ENCHANTMENT IN TWO SOULS TINGED WITH VOLUPTUOUSNESS
IN MARIUS AND WITH MODESTY IN COSETTE
THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER IN LOW
TONES WE WILL GO BACK TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR LITTLE GARDEN IN THE RUE
PLUMET THE FOLDS OF COSETTE'S GOWN LAY ACROSS MARIUS
SUCH A DAY IS AN INEFFABLE MIXTURE OF DREAM AND OF REALITY
ONE
POSSESSES AND ONE SUPPOSES
ONE STILL HAS TIME BEFORE ONE TO DIVINE
THE
EMOTION ON THAT DAY OF BEING AT MID DAY AND OF DREAMING OF MIDNIGHT
IS INDESCRIBABLE
THE DELIGHTS OF THESE TWO HEARTS OVERFLOWED UPON THE
CROWD AND INSPIRED THE PASSERS BY WITH CHEERFULNESS
PEOPLE HALTED IN THE RUE SAINT ANTOINE IN FRONT OF SAINT PAUL TO GAZE
THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE CARRIAGE AT THE ORANGE FLOWERS QUIVERING ON
COSETTE'S HEAD
THEN THEY RETURNED HOME TO THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE
MARIUS
TRIUMPHANT AND RADIANT MOUNTED SIDE BY SIDE WITH COSETTE THE STAIRCASE
UP WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORNE IN A DYING CONDITION
THE POOR WHO HAD
TROOPED TO THE DOOR AND WHO SHARED THEIR PURSES BLESSED THEM
THERE
WERE FLOWERS EVERYWHERE
THE HOUSE WAS NO LESS FRAGRANT THAN THE CHURCH
AFTER THE INCENSE ROSES
THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD VOICES CAROLLING IN
THE INFINITE THEY HAD GOD IN THEIR HEARTS DESTINY APPEARED TO THEM
LIKE A CEILING OF STARS ABOVE THEIR HEADS THEY BEHELD THE LIGHT OF A
RISING SUN
ALL AT ONCE THE CLOCK STRUCK
MARIUS GLANCED AT COSETTE'S
CHARMING BARE ARM AND AT THE ROSY THINGS WHICH WERE VAGUELY VISIBLE
THROUGH THE LACE OF HER BODICE AND COSETTE INTERCEPTING MARIUS'
GLANCE BLUSHED TO HER VERY HAIR
QUITE A NUMBER OF OLD FAMILY FRIENDS OF THE GILLENORMAND FAMILY HAD
BEEN INVITED THEY PRESSED ABOUT COSETTE
EACH ONE VIED WITH THE REST IN
SALUTING HER AS MADAME LA BARONNE
THE OFFICER THEODULE GILLENORMAND NOW A CAPTAIN HAD COME FROM
CHARTRES WHERE HE WAS STATIONED IN GARRISON TO BE PRESENT AT THE
WEDDING OF HIS COUSIN PONTMERCY
COSETTE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM
HE ON HIS SIDE HABITUATED AS HE WAS TO HAVE WOMEN CONSIDER HIM
HANDSOME RETAINED NO MORE RECOLLECTION OF COSETTE THAN OF ANY OTHER
WOMAN
HOW RIGHT I WAS NOT TO BELIEVE IN THAT STORY ABOUT THE LANCER SAID
FATHER GILLENORMAND TO HIMSELF
COSETTE HAD NEVER BEEN MORE TENDER WITH JEAN VALJEAN
SHE WAS IN UNISON
WITH FATHER GILLENORMAND WHILE HE ERECTED JOY INTO APHORISMS AND
MAXIMS SHE EXHALED GOODNESS LIKE A PERFUME
HAPPINESS DESIRES THAT ALL
THE WORLD SHOULD BE HAPPY
SHE REGAINED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADDRESSING JEAN VALJEAN INFLECTIONS OF
VOICE BELONGING TO THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL
SHE CARESSED HIM
WITH HER SMILE
A BANQUET HAD BEEN SPREAD IN THE DINING ROOM
ILLUMINATION AS BRILLIANT AS THE DAYLIGHT IS THE NECESSARY SEASONING OF
A GREAT JOY
MIST AND OBSCURITY ARE NOT ACCEPTED BY THE HAPPY
THEY DO
NOT CONSENT TO BE BLACK
THE NIGHT YES THE SHADOWS NO
IF THERE IS NO
SUN ONE MUST BE MADE
THE DINING ROOM WAS FULL OF GAY THINGS
IN THE CENTRE ABOVE THE WHITE
AND GLITTERING TABLE WAS A VENETIAN LUSTRE WITH FLAT PLATES WITH ALL
SORTS OF COLORED BIRDS BLUE VIOLET RED AND GREEN PERCHED AMID THE
CANDLES AROUND THE CHANDELIER GIRANDOLES ON THE WALLS SCONCES WITH
TRIPLE AND QUINTUPLE BRANCHES MIRRORS SILVERWARE GLASSWARE PLATE
PORCELAIN FAIENCE POTTERY GOLD AND SILVERSMITH'S WORK ALL WAS
SPARKLING AND GAY
THE EMPTY SPACES BETWEEN THE CANDELABRA WERE FILLED
IN WITH BOUQUETS SO THAT WHERE THERE WAS NOT A LIGHT THERE WAS A
FLOWER
IN THE ANTECHAMBER THREE VIOLINS AND A FLUTE SOFTLY PLAYED QUARTETTES
BY HAYDN
JEAN VALJEAN HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON A CHAIR IN THE DRAWING ROOM BEHIND
THE DOOR THE LEAF OF WHICH FOLDED BACK UPON HIM IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO
NEARLY CONCEAL HIM
A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE COSETTE
CAME AS THOUGH INSPIRED BY A SUDDEN WHIM AND MADE HIM A DEEP COURTESY
SPREADING OUT HER BRIDAL TOILET WITH BOTH HANDS AND WITH A TENDERLY
ROGUISH GLANCE SHE ASKED HIM
FATHER ARE YOU SATISFIED
YES SAID JEAN VALJEAN I AM CONTENT
WELL THEN LAUGH
JEAN VALJEAN BEGAN TO LAUGH
A FEW MOMENTS LATER BASQUE ANNOUNCED THAT DINNER WAS SERVED
THE GUESTS PRECEDED BY M
GILLENORMAND WITH COSETTE ON HIS ARM ENTERED
THE DINING ROOM AND ARRANGED THEMSELVES IN THE PROPER ORDER AROUND THE
TABLE
TWO LARGE ARM CHAIRS FIGURED ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE BRIDE THE
FIRST FOR M
GILLENORMAND THE OTHER FOR JEAN VALJEAN
M
GILLENORMAND
TOOK HIS SEAT
THE OTHER ARM CHAIR REMAINED EMPTY
THEY LOOKED ABOUT FOR M
FAUCHELEVENT
HE WAS NO LONGER THERE
M
GILLENORMAND QUESTIONED BASQUE
DO YOU KNOW WHERE M
FAUCHELEVENT IS
SIR REPLIED BASQUE I DO PRECISELY
M
FAUCHELEVENT TOLD ME TO SAY
TO YOU SIR THAT HE WAS SUFFERING HIS INJURED HAND WAS PAINING HIM
SOMEWHAT AND THAT HE COULD NOT DINE WITH MONSIEUR LE BARON AND MADAME
LA BARONNE
THAT HE BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED THAT HE WOULD COME TO MORROW
HE HAS JUST TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE
THAT EMPTY ARM CHAIR CHILLED THE EFFUSION OF THE WEDDING FEAST FOR A
MOMENT
BUT IF M
FAUCHELEVENT WAS ABSENT M
GILLENORMAND WAS PRESENT
AND THE GRANDFATHER BEAMED FOR TWO
HE AFFIRMED THAT M
FAUCHELEVENT HAD
DONE WELL TO RETIRE EARLY IF HE WERE SUFFERING BUT THAT IT WAS ONLY A
SLIGHT AILMENT
THIS DECLARATION SUFFICED
MOREOVER WHAT IS AN OBSCURE
CORNER IN SUCH A SUBMERSION OF JOY COSETTE AND MARIUS WERE PASSING
THROUGH ONE OF THOSE EGOTISTICAL AND BLESSED MOMENTS WHEN NO OTHER
FACULTY IS LEFT TO A PERSON THAN THAT OF RECEIVING HAPPINESS
AND THEN
AN IDEA OCCURRED TO M
GILLENORMAND PARDIEU THIS ARMCHAIR IS EMPTY
COME HITHER MARIUS
YOUR AUNT WILL PERMIT IT ALTHOUGH SHE HAS A
RIGHT TO YOU
THIS ARMCHAIR IS FOR YOU
THAT IS LEGAL AND DELIGHTFUL
FORTUNATUS BESIDE FORTUNATA APPLAUSE FROM THE WHOLE TABLE
MARIUS
TOOK JEAN VALJEAN'S PLACE BESIDE COSETTE AND THINGS FELL OUT SO THAT
COSETTE WHO HAD AT FIRST BEEN SADDENED BY JEAN VALJEAN'S ABSENCE
ENDED BY BEING SATISFIED WITH IT
FROM THE MOMENT WHEN MARIUS TOOK HIS
PLACE AND WAS THE SUBSTITUTE COSETTE WOULD NOT HAVE REGRETTED GOD
HIMSELF
SHE SET HER SWEET LITTLE FOOT SHOD IN WHITE SATIN ON MARIUS'
FOOT
THE ARM CHAIR BEING OCCUPIED M
FAUCHELEVENT WAS OBLITERATED AND
NOTHING WAS LACKING
AND FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARD THE WHOLE TABLE FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER
WAS LAUGHING WITH ALL THE ANIMATION OF FORGETFULNESS
AT DESSERT M
GILLENORMAND RISING TO HIS FEET WITH A GLASS OF
CHAMPAGNE IN HIS HAND ONLY HALF FULL SO THAT THE PALSY OF HIS EIGHTY
YEARS MIGHT NOT CAUSE AN OVERFLOW PROPOSED THE HEALTH OF THE MARRIED
PAIR
YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE TWO SERMONS HE EXCLAIMED
THIS MORNING YOU
HAD ONE FROM THE CURE THIS EVENING YOU SHALL HAVE ONE FROM YOUR
GRANDFATHER
LISTEN TO ME I WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF ADVICE ADORE EACH

DIAMOND CALLED THE SANCY BECAUSE IT BELONGED TO HARLEY DE SANCY OR
BECAUSE IT WEIGHS SIX HUNDRED CARATS I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT LIFE IS
FULL OF SUCH PROBLEMS THE IMPORTANT POINT IS TO POSSESS THE SANCY AND
HAPPINESS
LET US BE HAPPY WITHOUT QUIBBLING AND QUIRKING
LET US OBEY
THE SUN BLINDLY
WHAT IS THE SUN IT IS LOVE

I AM NO LONGER ROYALIST EXCEPT TOWARDS THAT
ROYALTY
WHAT IS ADAM THE KINGDOM OF EVE
NO '89 FOR EVE
THERE HAS
BEEN THE ROYAL SCEPTRE SURMOUNTED BY A FLEUR DE LYS THERE HAS BEEN THE
IMPERIAL SCEPTRE SURMOUNTED BY A GLOBE THERE HAS BEEN THE SCEPTRE OF
CHARLEMAGNE WHICH WAS OF IRON THERE HAS BEEN THE SCEPTRE OF LOUIS THE
GREAT WHICH WAS OF GOLD THE REVOLUTION TWISTED THEM BETWEEN ITS THUMB
AND FOREFINGER HA'PENNY STRAWS IT IS DONE WITH IT IS BROKEN IT LIES
ON THE EARTH THERE IS NO LONGER ANY SCEPTRE BUT MAKE ME A REVOLUTION
AGAINST THAT LITTLE EMBROIDERED HANDKERCHIEF WHICH SMELLS OF PATCHOULI
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU DO IT
TRY
WHY IS IT SO SOLID BECAUSE IT IS A
GEWGAW
AH YOU ARE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WELL WHAT THEN AND WE
HAVE BEEN AS FOOLISH AS YOU
DO NOT IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE EFFECTED
MUCH CHANGE IN THE UNIVERSE BECAUSE YOUR TRIP GALLANT IS CALLED THE
CHOLERA MORBUS AND BECAUSE YOUR POURREE IS CALLED THE CACHUCA
IN FACT
THE WOMEN MUST ALWAYS BE LOVED
I DEFY YOU TO ESCAPE FROM THAT
THESE
FRIENDS ARE OUR ANGELS
YES LOVE WOMAN THE KISS FORMS A CIRCLE FROM
WHICH I DEFY YOU TO ESCAPE AND FOR MY OWN PART I SHOULD BE ONLY
TOO HAPPY TO RE ENTER IT
WHICH OF YOU HAS SEEN THE PLANET VENUS THE
COQUETTE OF THE ABYSS THE CELIMENE OF THE OCEAN RISE IN THE INFINITE
CALMING ALL HERE BELOW THE OCEAN IS A ROUGH ALCESTIS
WELL GRUMBLE
AS HE WILL WHEN VENUS APPEARS HE IS FORCED TO SMILE
THAT BRUTE BEAST
SUBMITS
WE ARE ALL MADE SO
WRATH TEMPEST CLAPS OF THUNDER FOAM TO
THE VERY CEILING
A WOMAN ENTERS ON THE SCENE A PLANET RISES FLAT ON
YOUR FACE MARIUS WAS FIGHTING SIX MONTHS AGO TO DAY HE IS MARRIED
THAT IS WELL
YES MARIUS YES COSETTE YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT
EXIST
BOLDLY FOR EACH OTHER MAKE US BURST WITH RAGE THAT WE CANNOT DO THE
SAME IDEALIZE EACH OTHER CATCH IN YOUR BEAKS ALL THE TINY BLADES OF
FELICITY THAT EXIST ON EARTH AND ARRANGE YOURSELVES A NEST FOR LIFE
PARDI TO LOVE TO BE LOVED WHAT A FINE MIRACLE WHEN ONE IS YOUNG
DON'T IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE INVENTED THAT
I TOO HAVE HAD MY DREAM I
TOO HAVE MEDITATED I TOO HAVE SIGHED I TOO HAVE HAD A MOONLIGHT
SOUL
LOVE IS A CHILD SIX THOUSAND YEARS OLD
LOVE HAS THE RIGHT TO A
LONG WHITE BEARD
METHUSALEM IS A STREET ARAB BESIDE CUPID
FOR SIXTY
CENTURIES MEN AND WOMEN HAVE GOT OUT OF THEIR SCRAPE BY LOVING
THE
DEVIL WHO IS CUNNING TOOK TO HATING MAN MAN WHO IS STILL MORE
CUNNING TOOK TO LOVING WOMAN
IN THIS WAY HE DOES MORE GOOD THAN
THE DEVIL DOES HIM HARM
THIS CRAFT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE DAYS OF
THE TERRESTRIAL PARADISE
THE INVENTION IS OLD MY FRIENDS BUT IT IS
PERFECTLY NEW
PROFIT BY IT
BE DAPHNIS AND CHLOE WHILE WAITING TO
BECOME PHILEMON AND BAUCIS
MANAGE SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE WITH EACH
OTHER NOTHING SHALL BE LACKING TO YOU AND THAT COSETTE MAY BE THE SUN
FOR MARIUS AND THAT MARIUS MAY BE THE UNIVERSE TO COSETTE
COSETTE LET
YOUR FINE WEATHER BE THE SMILE OF YOUR HUSBAND MARIUS LET YOUR RAIN
BE YOUR WIFE'S TEARS
AND LET IT NEVER RAIN IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD
YOU HAVE
FILCHED THE WINNING NUMBER IN THE LOTTERY YOU HAVE GAINED THE GREAT
PRIZE GUARD IT WELL KEEP IT UNDER LOCK AND KEY DO NOT SQUANDER IT
ADORE EACH OTHER AND SNAP YOUR FINGERS AT ALL THE REST
BELIEVE WHAT I
SAY TO YOU
IT IS GOOD SENSE
AND GOOD SENSE CANNOT LIE
BE A RELIGION
TO EACH OTHER
EACH MAN HAS HIS OWN FASHION OF ADORING GOD
SAPERLOTTE
THE BEST WAY TO ADORE GOD IS TO LOVE ONE'S WIFE
I LOVE THEE THAT'S
MY CATECHISM
HE WHO LOVES IS ORTHODOX
THE OATH OF HENRI IV
PLACES
SANCTITY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FEASTING AND DRUNKENNESS
VENTRE SAINT GRIS
I DON'T BELONG TO THE RELIGION OF THAT OATH
WOMAN IS FORGOTTEN IN IT
THIS ASTONISHES ME ON THE PART OF HENRI IV
MY FRIENDS LONG LIVE WOMEN
I AM OLD THEY SAY IT'S ASTONISHING HOW MUCH I FEEL IN THE MOOD TO
BE YOUNG
I SHOULD LIKE TO GO AND LISTEN TO THE BAGPIPES IN THE WOODS
CHILDREN WHO CONTRIVE TO BE BEAUTIFUL AND CONTENTED THAT INTOXICATES
ME
I WOULD LIKE GREATLY TO GET MARRIED IF ANY ONE WOULD HAVE ME
IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THAT GOD COULD HAVE MADE US FOR ANYTHING BUT THIS
TO IDOLIZE TO COO TO PREEN OURSELVES TO BE DOVE LIKE TO BE DAINTY
TO BILL AND COO OUR LOVES FROM MORN TO NIGHT TO GAZE AT ONE'S IMAGE IN
ONE'S LITTLE WIFE TO BE PROUD TO BE TRIUMPHANT TO PLUME ONESELF THAT
IS THE AIM OF LIFE
THERE LET NOT THAT DISPLEASE YOU WHICH WE USED TO
THINK IN OUR DAY WHEN WE WERE YOUNG FOLKS
AH VERTU BAMBOCHE WHAT
CHARMING WOMEN THERE WERE IN THOSE DAYS AND WHAT PRETTY LITTLE FACES
AND WHAT LOVELY LASSES I COMMITTED MY RAVAGES AMONG THEM
THEN LOVE
EACH OTHER
IF PEOPLE DID NOT LOVE EACH OTHER I REALLY DO NOT SEE WHAT
USE THERE WOULD BE IN HAVING ANY SPRINGTIME AND FOR MY OWN PART I
SHOULD PRAY THE GOOD GOD TO SHUT UP ALL THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT HE
SHOWS US AND TO TAKE AWAY FROM US AND PUT BACK IN HIS BOX THE FLOWERS
THE BIRDS AND THE PRETTY MAIDENS
MY CHILDREN RECEIVE AN OLD MAN'S
BLESSING
THE EVENING WAS GAY LIVELY AND AGREEABLE
THE GRANDFATHER'S SOVEREIGN
GOOD HUMOR GAVE THE KEY NOTE TO THE WHOLE FEAST AND EACH PERSON
REGULATED HIS CONDUCT ON THAT ALMOST CENTENARIAN CORDIALITY
THEY DANCED
A LITTLE THEY LAUGHED A GREAT DEAL IT WAS AN AMIABLE WEDDING
GOODMAN
DAYS OF YORE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVITED TO IT
HOWEVER HE WAS PRESENT IN
THE PERSON OF FATHER GILLENORMAND
THERE WAS A TUMULT THEN SILENCE
THE MARRIED PAIR DISAPPEARED
A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT THE GILLENORMAND HOUSE BECAME A TEMPLE
HERE WE PAUSE
ON THE THRESHOLD OF WEDDING NIGHTS STANDS A SMILING ANGEL
WITH HIS FINGER ON HIS LIPS
THE SOUL ENTERS INTO CONTEMPLATION BEFORE THAT SANCTUARY WHERE THE
CELEBRATION OF LOVE TAKES PLACE
THERE SHOULD BE FLASHES OF LIGHT ATHWART SUCH HOUSES
THE JOY WHICH
THEY CONTAIN OUGHT TO MAKE ITS ESCAPE THROUGH THE STONES OF THE WALLS IN
BRILLIANCY AND VAGUELY ILLUMINATE THE GLOOM
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THIS
SACRED AND FATAL FESTIVAL SHOULD NOT GIVE OFF A CELESTIAL RADIANCE TO
THE INFINITE
LOVE IS THE SUBLIME CRUCIBLE WHEREIN THE FUSION OF THE MAN
AND THE WOMAN TAKES PLACE THE BEING ONE THE BEING TRIPLE THE BEING
FINAL THE HUMAN TRINITY PROCEEDS FROM IT
THIS BIRTH OF TWO SOULS INTO
ONE OUGHT TO BE AN EMOTION FOR THE GLOOM
THE LOVER IS THE PRIEST
THE RAVISHED VIRGIN IS TERRIFIED
SOMETHING OF THAT JOY ASCENDS TO GOD
WHERE TRUE MARRIAGE IS THAT IS TO SAY WHERE THERE IS LOVE THE IDEAL
ENTERS IN
A NUPTIAL BED MAKES A NOOK OF DAWN AMID THE SHADOWS
IF IT
WERE GIVEN TO THE EYE OF THE FLESH TO SCAN THE FORMIDABLE AND CHARMING
VISIONS OF THE UPPER LIFE IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE SHOULD BEHOLD THE
FORMS OF NIGHT THE WINGED UNKNOWNS THE BLUE PASSERS OF THE INVISIBLE
BEND DOWN A THRONG OF SOMBRE HEADS AROUND THE LUMINOUS HOUSE
SATISFIED SHOWERING BENEDICTIONS POINTING OUT TO EACH OTHER THE VIRGIN
WIFE GENTLY ALARMED SWEETLY TERRIFIED AND BEARING THE REFLECTION OF
HUMAN BLISS UPON THEIR DIVINE COUNTENANCES
IF AT THAT SUPREME HOUR THE
WEDDED PAIR DAZZLED WITH VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND BELIEVING THEMSELVES ALONE
WERE TO LISTEN THEY WOULD HEAR IN THEIR CHAMBER A CONFUSED RUSTLING OF
WINGS
PERFECT HAPPINESS IMPLIES A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING WITH THE ANGELS
THAT DARK LITTLE CHAMBER HAS ALL HEAVEN FOR ITS CEILING
WHEN TWO
MOUTHS RENDERED SACRED BY LOVE APPROACH TO CREATE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ABOVE THAT INEFFABLE KISS A QUIVERING
THROUGHOUT THE IMMENSE MYSTERY OF STARS
THESE FELICITIES ARE THE TRUE ONES
THERE IS NO JOY OUTSIDE OF THESE
JOYS
LOVE IS THE ONLY ECSTASY
ALL THE REST WEEPS
TO LOVE OR TO HAVE LOVED THIS SUFFICES
DEMAND NOTHING MORE
THERE
IS NO OTHER PEARL TO BE FOUND IN THE SHADOWY FOLDS OF LIFE
TO LOVE IS A
FULFILMENT
CHAPTER III THE INSEPARABLE
WHAT HAD BECOME OF JEAN VALJEAN
IMMEDIATELY AFTER HAVING LAUGHED AT COSETTE'S GRACEFUL COMMAND WHEN
NO ONE WAS PAYING ANY HEED TO HIM JEAN VALJEAN HAD RISEN AND HAD GAINED
THE ANTECHAMBER UNPERCEIVED
THIS WAS THE VERY ROOM WHICH EIGHT MONTHS
BEFORE HE HAD ENTERED BLACK WITH MUD WITH BLOOD AND POWDER BRINGING
BACK THE GRANDSON TO THE GRANDFATHER
THE OLD WAINSCOTING WAS GARLANDED
WITH FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS THE MUSICIANS WERE SEATED ON THE SOFA ON WHICH
THEY HAD LAID MARIUS DOWN
BASQUE IN A BLACK COAT KNEE BREECHES WHITE
STOCKINGS AND WHITE GLOVES WAS ARRANGING ROSES ROUND ALL OF THE DISHES
THAT WERE TO BE SERVED
JEAN VALJEAN POINTED TO HIS ARM IN ITS SLING
CHARGED BASQUE TO EXPLAIN HIS ABSENCE AND WENT AWAY
THE LONG WINDOWS OF THE DINING ROOM OPENED ON THE STREET
JEAN VALJEAN
STOOD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ERECT AND MOTIONLESS IN THE DARKNESS BENEATH
THOSE RADIANT WINDOWS
HE LISTENED
THE CONFUSED SOUNDS OF THE BANQUET
REACHED HIS EAR
HE HEARD THE LOUD COMMANDING TONES OF THE GRANDFATHER
THE VIOLINS THE CLATTER OF THE PLATES THE BURSTS OF LAUGHTER AND
THROUGH ALL THAT MERRY UPROAR HE DISTINGUISHED COSETTE'S SWEET AND
JOYOUS VOICE
HE QUITTED THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE AND RETURNED TO THE RUE DE
L'HOMME ARME
IN ORDER TO RETURN THITHER HE TOOK THE RUE SAINT LOUIS THE RUE
CULTURE SAINTE CATHERINE AND THE BLANCS MANTEAUX IT WAS A LITTLE
LONGER BUT IT WAS THE ROAD THROUGH WHICH FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS
HE HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO PASS EVERY DAY ON HIS WAY FROM THE RUE DE
L'HOMME ARME TO THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE IN ORDER TO AVOID THE
OBSTRUCTIONS AND THE MUD IN THE RUE VIELLE DU TEMPLE
THIS ROAD THROUGH WHICH COSETTE HAD PASSED EXCLUDED FOR HIM ALL
POSSIBILITY OF ANY OTHER ITINERARY
JEAN VALJEAN ENTERED HIS LODGINGS
HE LIGHTED HIS CANDLE AND MOUNTED
THE STAIRS
THE APARTMENT WAS EMPTY
EVEN TOUSSAINT WAS NO LONGER THERE
JEAN VALJEAN'S STEP MADE MORE NOISE THAN USUAL IN THE CHAMBERS
ALL THE
CUPBOARDS STOOD OPEN
HE PENETRATED TO COSETTE'S BEDROOM
THERE WERE NO
SHEETS ON THE BED
THE PILLOW COVERED WITH TICKING AND WITHOUT A CASE
OR LACE WAS LAID ON THE BLANKETS FOLDED UP ON THE FOOT OF THE MATTRESS
WHOSE COVERING WAS VISIBLE AND ON WHICH NO ONE WAS EVER TO SLEEP AGAIN
ALL THE LITTLE FEMININE OBJECTS WHICH COSETTE WAS ATTACHED TO HAD BEEN
CARRIED AWAY NOTHING REMAINED EXCEPT THE HEAVY FURNITURE AND THE FOUR
WALLS
TOUSSAINT'S BED WAS DESPOILED IN LIKE MANNER
ONE BED ONLY WAS
MADE UP AND SEEMED TO BE WAITING SOME ONE AND THIS WAS JEAN VALJEAN'S
BED
JEAN VALJEAN LOOKED AT THE WALLS CLOSED SOME OF THE CUPBOARD DOORS AND
WENT AND CAME FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER
THEN HE SOUGHT HIS OWN CHAMBER ONCE MORE AND SET HIS CANDLE ON A TABLE
HE HAD DISENGAGED HIS ARM FROM THE SLING AND HE USED HIS RIGHT HAND AS
THOUGH IT DID NOT HURT HIM
HE APPROACHED HIS BED AND HIS EYES RESTED WAS IT BY CHANCE WAS IT
INTENTIONALLY ON THE INSEPARABLE OF WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN JEALOUS ON
THE LITTLE PORTMANTEAU WHICH NEVER LEFT HIM
ON HIS ARRIVAL IN THE RUE
DE L'HOMME ARME ON THE 4TH OF JUNE HE HAD DEPOSITED IT ON A ROUND
TABLE NEAR THE HEAD OF HIS BED
HE WENT TO THIS TABLE WITH A SORT OF
VIVACITY TOOK A KEY FROM HIS POCKET AND OPENED THE VALISE
FROM IT HE SLOWLY DREW FORTH THE GARMENTS IN WHICH TEN YEARS BEFORE
COSETTE HAD QUITTED MONTFERMEIL FIRST THE LITTLE GOWN THEN THE BLACK
FICHU THEN THE STOUT COARSE CHILD'S SHOES WHICH COSETTE MIGHT ALMOST
HAVE WORN STILL SO TINY WERE HER FEET THEN THE FUSTIAN BODICE WHICH
WAS VERY THICK THEN THE KNITTED PETTICOAT NEXT THE APRON WITH POCKETS
THEN THE WOOLLEN STOCKINGS
THESE STOCKINGS WHICH STILL PRESERVED THE
GRACEFUL FORM OF A TINY LEG WERE NO LONGER THAN JEAN VALJEAN'S HAND
ALL THIS WAS BLACK OF HUE
IT WAS HE WHO HAD BROUGHT THOSE GARMENTS TO
MONTFERMEIL FOR HER
AS HE REMOVED THEM FROM THE VALISE HE LAID THEM ON
THE BED
HE FELL TO THINKING
HE CALLED UP MEMORIES
IT WAS IN WINTER
IN A VERY COLD MONTH OF DECEMBER SHE WAS SHIVERING HALF NAKED IN
RAGS HER POOR LITTLE FEET WERE ALL RED IN THEIR WOODEN SHOES
HE JEAN
VALJEAN HAD MADE HER ABANDON THOSE RAGS TO CLOTHE HERSELF IN THESE
MOURNING HABILIMENTS
THE MOTHER MUST HAVE FELT PLEASED IN HER GRAVE TO
SEE HER DAUGHTER WEARING MOURNING FOR HER AND ABOVE ALL TO SEE THAT
SHE WAS PROPERLY CLOTHED AND THAT SHE WAS WARM
HE THOUGHT OF THAT
FOREST OF MONTFERMEIL THEY HAD TRAVERSED IT TOGETHER COSETTE AND HE
HE THOUGHT OF WHAT THE WEATHER HAD BEEN OF THE LEAFLESS TREES OF THE
WOOD DESTITUTE OF BIRDS OF THE SUNLESS SKY IT MATTERED NOT IT WAS
CHARMING
HE ARRANGED THE TINY GARMENTS ON THE BED THE FICHU NEXT TO
THE PETTICOAT THE STOCKINGS BESIDE THE SHOES AND HE LOOKED AT THEM
ONE AFTER THE OTHER
SHE WAS NO TALLER THAN THAT SHE HAD HER BIG DOLL
IN HER ARMS SHE HAD PUT HER LOUIS D'OR IN THE POCKET OF THAT APRON SHE
HAD LAUGHED THEY WALKED HAND IN HAND SHE HAD NO ONE IN THE WORLD BUT
HIM
THEN HIS VENERABLE WHITE HEAD FELL FORWARD ON THE BED THAT STOICAL OLD
HEART BROKE HIS FACE WAS ENGULFED SO TO SPEAK IN COSETTE'S GARMENTS
AND IF ANY ONE HAD PASSED UP THE STAIRS AT THAT MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE
HEARD FRIGHTFUL SOBS
CHAPTER IV THE IMMORTAL LIVER 68
THE OLD AND FORMIDABLE STRUGGLE OF WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY WITNESSED SO
MANY PHASES BEGAN ONCE MORE
JACOB STRUGGLED WITH THE ANGEL BUT ONE NIGHT
ALAS HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
WE BEHELD JEAN VALJEAN SEIZED BODILY BY HIS CONSCIENCE IN THE DARKNESS
AND STRUGGLING DESPERATELY AGAINST IT
UNHEARD OF CONFLICT AT CERTAIN MOMENTS THE FOOT SLIPS AT OTHER MOMENTS
THE GROUND CRUMBLES AWAY UNDERFOOT
HOW MANY TIMES HAD THAT CONSCIENCE
MAD FOR THE GOOD CLASPED AND OVERTHROWN HIM HOW MANY TIMES HAD THE
TRUTH SET HER KNEE INEXORABLY UPON HIS BREAST HOW MANY TIMES HURLED
TO EARTH BY THE LIGHT HAD HE BEGGED FOR MERCY HOW MANY TIMES HAD
THAT IMPLACABLE SPARK LIGHTED WITHIN HIM AND UPON HIM BY THE BISHOP
DAZZLED HIM BY FORCE WHEN HE HAD WISHED TO BE BLIND HOW MANY TIMES
HAD HE RISEN TO HIS FEET IN THE COMBAT HELD FAST TO THE ROCK LEANING
AGAINST SOPHISM DRAGGED IN THE DUST NOW GETTING THE UPPER HAND OF HIS
CONSCIENCE AGAIN OVERTHROWN BY IT HOW MANY TIMES AFTER AN EQUIVOQUE
AFTER THE SPECIOUS AND TREACHEROUS REASONING OF EGOTISM HAD HE HEARD
HIS IRRITATED CONSCIENCE CRY IN HIS EAR A TRIP YOU WRETCH HOW MANY
TIMES HAD HIS REFRACTORY THOUGHTS RATTLED CONVULSIVELY IN HIS THROAT
UNDER THE EVIDENCE OF DUTY RESISTANCE TO GOD
FUNEREAL SWEATS
WHAT
SECRET WOUNDS WHICH HE ALONE FELT BLEED WHAT EXCORIATIONS IN HIS
LAMENTABLE EXISTENCE HOW MANY TIMES HE HAD RISEN BLEEDING BRUISED
BROKEN ENLIGHTENED DESPAIR IN HIS HEART SERENITY IN HIS SOUL
AND VANQUISHED HE HAD FELT HIMSELF THE CONQUEROR
AND AFTER HAVING
DISLOCATED BROKEN AND RENT HIS CONSCIENCE WITH RED HOT PINCERS IT HAD
SAID TO HIM AS IT STOOD OVER HIM FORMIDABLE LUMINOUS AND TRANQUIL
NOW GO IN PEACE
BUT ON EMERGING FROM SO MELANCHOLY A CONFLICT WHAT A LUGUBRIOUS PEACE
ALAS
NEVERTHELESS THAT NIGHT JEAN VALJEAN FELT THAT HE WAS PASSING THROUGH
HIS FINAL COMBAT
A HEART RENDING QUESTION PRESENTED ITSELF
PREDESTINATIONS ARE NOT ALL DIRECT THEY DO NOT OPEN OUT IN A STRAIGHT
AVENUE BEFORE THE PREDESTINED MAN THEY HAVE BLIND COURTS IMPASSABLE
ALLEYS OBSCURE TURNS DISTURBING CROSSROADS OFFERING THE CHOICE OF MANY
WAYS
JEAN VALJEAN HAD HALTED AT THAT MOMENT AT THE MOST PERILOUS OF
THESE CROSSROADS
HE HAD COME TO THE SUPREME CROSSING OF GOOD AND EVIL
HE HAD THAT
GLOOMY INTERSECTION BENEATH HIS EYES
ON THIS OCCASION ONCE MORE AS HAD
HAPPENED TO HIM ALREADY IN OTHER SAD VICISSITUDES TWO ROADS OPENED OUT
BEFORE HIM THE ONE TEMPTING THE OTHER ALARMING
WHICH WAS HE TO TAKE
HE WAS COUNSELLED TO THE ONE WHICH ALARMED HIM BY THAT MYSTERIOUS INDEX
FINGER WHICH WE ALL PERCEIVE WHENEVER WE FIX OUR EYES ON THE DARKNESS
ONCE MORE JEAN VALJEAN HAD THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE TERRIBLE PORT AND THE
SMILING AMBUSH
IS IT THEN TRUE THE SOUL MAY RECOVER BUT NOT FATE
FRIGHTFUL THING AN
INCURABLE DESTINY
THIS IS THE PROBLEM WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM
IN WHAT MANNER WAS JEAN VALJEAN TO BEHAVE IN RELATION TO THE HAPPINESS
OF COSETTE AND MARIUS IT WAS HE WHO HAD WILLED THAT HAPPINESS IT WAS
HE WHO HAD BROUGHT IT ABOUT HE HAD HIMSELF BURIED IT IN HIS ENTRAILS
AND AT THAT MOMENT WHEN HE REFLECTED ON IT HE WAS ABLE TO ENJOY THE
SORT OF SATISFACTION WHICH AN ARMORER WOULD EXPERIENCE ON RECOGNIZING
HIS FACTORY MARK ON A KNIFE ON WITHDRAWING IT ALL SMOKING FROM HIS
OWN BREAST
COSETTE HAD MARIUS MARIUS POSSESSED COSETTE
THEY HAD EVERYTHING EVEN
RICHES
AND THIS WAS HIS DOING
BUT WHAT WAS HE JEAN VALJEAN TO DO WITH THIS HAPPINESS NOW THAT
IT EXISTED NOW THAT IT WAS THERE SHOULD HE FORCE HIMSELF ON THIS
HAPPINESS SHOULD HE TREAT IT AS BELONGING TO HIM NO DOUBT COSETTE DID
BELONG TO ANOTHER BUT SHOULD HE JEAN VALJEAN RETAIN OF COSETTE ALL
THAT HE COULD RETAIN SHOULD HE REMAIN THE SORT OF FATHER HALF SEEN BUT
RESPECTED WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO BEEN SHOULD HE WITHOUT SAYING A
WORD BRING HIS PAST TO THAT FUTURE SHOULD HE PRESENT HIMSELF THERE
AS THOUGH HE HAD A RIGHT AND SHOULD HE SEAT HIMSELF VEILED AT THAT
LUMINOUS FIRESIDE SHOULD HE TAKE THOSE INNOCENT HANDS INTO HIS TRAGIC
HANDS WITH A SMILE SHOULD HE PLACE UPON THE PEACEFUL FENDER OF THE
GILLENORMAND DRAWING ROOM THOSE FEET OF HIS WHICH DRAGGED BEHIND THEM
THE DISGRACEFUL SHADOW OF THE LAW SHOULD HE ENTER INTO PARTICIPATION IN
THE FAIR FORTUNES OF COSETTE AND MARIUS SHOULD HE RENDER THE OBSCURITY
ON HIS BROW AND THE CLOUD UPON THEIRS STILL MORE DENSE SHOULD HE
PLACE HIS CATASTROPHE AS A THIRD ASSOCIATE IN THEIR FELICITY SHOULD HE
CONTINUE TO HOLD HIS PEACE IN A WORD SHOULD HE BE THE SINISTER MUTE OF
DESTINY BESIDE THESE TWO HAPPY BEINGS
WE MUST HAVE BECOME HABITUATED TO FATALITY AND TO ENCOUNTERS WITH IT IN
ORDER TO HAVE THE DARING TO RAISE OUR EYES WHEN CERTAIN QUESTIONS APPEAR
TO US IN ALL THEIR HORRIBLE NAKEDNESS
GOOD OR EVIL STANDS BEHIND
THIS SEVERE INTERROGATION POINT
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO DEMANDS THE
SPHINX
THIS HABIT OF TRIAL JEAN VALJEAN POSSESSED
HE GAZED INTENTLY AT THE
SPHINX
HE EXAMINED THE PITILESS PROBLEM UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS
COSETTE THAT CHARMING EXISTENCE WAS THE RAFT OF THIS SHIPWRECK
WHAT
WAS HE TO DO TO CLING FAST TO IT OR TO LET GO HIS HOLD
IF HE CLUNG TO IT HE SHOULD EMERGE FROM DISASTER HE SHOULD ASCEND
AGAIN INTO THE SUNLIGHT HE SHOULD LET THE BITTER WATER DRIP FROM HIS
GARMENTS AND HIS HAIR HE WAS SAVED HE SHOULD LIVE
AND IF HE LET GO HIS HOLD
THEN THE ABYSS
THUS HE TOOK SAD COUNCIL WITH HIS THOUGHTS
OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY
HE FOUGHT HE KICKED FURIOUSLY INTERNALLY NOW AGAINST HIS WILL NOW
AGAINST HIS CONVICTION
HAPPILY FOR JEAN VALJEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO WEEP
THAT RELIEVED
HIM POSSIBLY
BUT THE BEGINNING WAS SAVAGE
A TEMPEST MORE FURIOUS
THAN THE ONE WHICH HAD FORMERLY DRIVEN HIM TO ARRAS BROKE LOOSE WITHIN
HIM
THE PAST SURGED UP BEFORE HIM FACING THE PRESENT HE COMPARED
THEM AND SOBBED
THE SILENCE OF TEARS ONCE OPENED THE DESPAIRING MAN
WRITHED
HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN STOPPED SHORT
ALAS IN THIS FIGHT TO THE DEATH BETWEEN OUR EGOTISM AND OUR DUTY WHEN
WE THUS RETREAT STEP BY STEP BEFORE OUR IMMUTABLE IDEAL BEWILDERED
FURIOUS EXASPERATED AT HAVING TO YIELD DISPUTING THE GROUND HOPING
FOR A POSSIBLE FLIGHT SEEKING AN ESCAPE WHAT AN ABRUPT AND SINISTER
RESISTANCE DOES THE FOOT OF THE WALL OFFER IN OUR REAR
TO FEEL THE SACRED SHADOW WHICH FORMS AN OBSTACLE
THE INVISIBLE INEXORABLE WHAT AN OBSESSION
THEN ONE IS NEVER DONE WITH CONSCIENCE
MAKE YOUR CHOICE BRUTUS MAKE
YOUR CHOICE CATO
IT IS FATHOMLESS SINCE IT IS GOD
ONE FLINGS INTO
THAT WELL THE LABOR OF ONE'S WHOLE LIFE ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S FORTUNE
ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S RICHES ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S SUCCESS ONE FLINGS IN
ONE'S LIBERTY OR FATHERLAND ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S WELL BEING ONE FLINGS
IN ONE'S REPOSE ONE FLINGS IN ONE'S JOY MORE MORE MORE EMPTY THE
VASE TIP THE URN ONE MUST FINISH BY FLINGING IN ONE'S HEART
SOMEWHERE IN THE FOG OF THE ANCIENT HELLS THERE IS A TUN LIKE THAT
IS NOT ONE PARDONABLE IF ONE AT LAST REFUSES CAN THE INEXHAUSTIBLE
HAVE ANY RIGHT ARE NOT CHAINS WHICH ARE ENDLESS ABOVE HUMAN STRENGTH
WHO WOULD BLAME SISYPHUS AND JEAN VALJEAN FOR SAYING IT IS ENOUGH
THE OBEDIENCE OF MATTER IS LIMITED BY FRICTION IS THERE NO LIMIT TO THE
OBEDIENCE OF THE SOUL IF PERPETUAL MOTION IS IMPOSSIBLE CAN PERPETUAL
SELF SACRIFICE BE EXACTED
THE FIRST STEP IS NOTHING IT IS THE LAST WHICH IS DIFFICULT
WHAT WAS
THE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIR IN COMPARISON WITH COSETTE'S MARRIAGE AND OF
THAT WHICH IT ENTAILED WHAT IS A RE ENTRANCE INTO THE GALLEYS COMPARED
TO ENTRANCE INTO THE VOID
OH FIRST STEP THAT MUST BE DESCENDED HOW SOMBRE ART THOU OH SECOND
STEP HOW BLACK ART THOU
HOW COULD HE REFRAIN FROM TURNING ASIDE HIS HEAD THIS TIME
MARTYRDOM IS SUBLIMATION CORROSIVE SUBLIMATION
IT IS A TORTURE WHICH
CONSECRATES
ONE CAN CONSENT TO IT FOR THE FIRST HOUR ONE SEATS ONESELF
ON THE THRONE OF GLOWING IRON ONE PLACES ON ONE'S HEAD THE CROWN OF HOT
IRON ONE ACCEPTS THE GLOBE OF RED HOT IRON ONE TAKES THE SCEPTRE OF
RED HOT IRON BUT THE MANTLE OF FLAME STILL REMAINS TO BE DONNED AND
COMES THERE NOT A MOMENT WHEN THE MISERABLE FLESH REVOLTS AND WHEN ONE
ABDICATES FROM SUFFERING
AT LENGTH JEAN VALJEAN ENTERED INTO THE PEACE OF EXHAUSTION
HE WEIGHED HE REFLECTED HE CONSIDERED THE ALTERNATIVES THE MYSTERIOUS
BALANCE OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
SHOULD HE IMPOSE HIS GALLEYS ON THOSE TWO DAZZLING CHILDREN OR SHOULD
HE CONSUMMATE HIS IRREMEDIABLE ENGULFMENT BY HIMSELF ON ONE SIDE LAY
THE SACRIFICE OF COSETTE ON THE OTHER THAT OF HIMSELF
AT WHAT SOLUTION SHOULD HE ARRIVE WHAT DECISION DID HE COME TO
WHAT RESOLUTION DID HE TAKE WHAT WAS HIS OWN INWARD DEFINITIVE RESPONSE
TO THE UNBRIBABLE INTERROGATORY OF FATALITY WHAT DOOR DID HE DECIDE TO
OPEN WHICH SIDE OF HIS LIFE DID HE RESOLVE UPON CLOSING AND CONDEMNING
AMONG ALL THE UNFATHOMABLE PRECIPICES WHICH SURROUNDED HIM WHICH WAS
HIS CHOICE WHAT EXTREMITY DID HE ACCEPT TO WHICH OF THE GULFS DID HE
NOD HIS HEAD
HIS DIZZY REVERY LASTED ALL NIGHT LONG
HE REMAINED THERE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IN THE SAME ATTITUDE BENT DOUBLE OVER
THAT BED PROSTRATE BENEATH THE ENORMITY OF FATE CRUSHED PERCHANCE
ALAS WITH CLENCHED FISTS WITH ARMS OUTSPREAD AT RIGHT ANGLES LIKE A
MAN CRUCIFIED WHO HAS BEEN UN NAILED AND FLUNG FACE DOWN ON THE EARTH
THERE HE REMAINED FOR TWELVE HOURS THE TWELVE LONG HOURS OF A LONG
WINTER'S NIGHT ICE COLD WITHOUT ONCE RAISING HIS HEAD AND WITHOUT
UTTERING A WORD
HE WAS AS MOTIONLESS AS A CORPSE WHILE HIS THOUGHTS
WALLOWED ON THE EARTH AND SOARED NOW LIKE THE HYDRA NOW LIKE THE
EAGLE
ANY ONE TO BEHOLD HIM THUS MOTIONLESS WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HIM
DEAD ALL AT ONCE HE SHUDDERED CONVULSIVELY AND HIS MOUTH GLUED TO
COSETTE'S GARMENTS KISSED THEM THEN IT COULD BE SEEN THAT HE WAS
ALIVE
WHO COULD SEE SINCE JEAN VALJEAN WAS ALONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
THE ONE WHO IS IN THE SHADOWS
BOOK SEVENTH THE LAST DRAUGHT FROM THE CUP
ILLUSTRATION LAST DROP FROM THE CUP 5B7 1 LAST DROP
CHAPTER I THE SEVENTH CIRCLE AND THE EIGHTH HEAVEN
THE DAYS THAT FOLLOW WEDDINGS ARE SOLITARY
PEOPLE RESPECT THE
MEDITATIONS OF THE HAPPY PAIR
AND ALSO THEIR TARDY SLUMBERS TO SOME
DEGREE
THE TUMULT OF VISITS AND CONGRATULATIONS ONLY BEGINS LATER ON
ON THE MORNING OF THE 17TH OF FEBRUARY IT WAS A LITTLE PAST MIDDAY WHEN
BASQUE WITH NAPKIN AND FEATHER DUSTER UNDER HIS ARM BUSY IN SETTING
HIS ANTECHAMBER TO RIGHTS HEARD A LIGHT TAP AT THE DOOR
THERE HAD BEEN
NO RING WHICH WAS DISCREET ON SUCH A DAY
BASQUE OPENED THE DOOR AND
BEHELD M
FAUCHELEVENT
HE INTRODUCED HIM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM STILL
ENCUMBERED AND TOPSY TURVY AND WHICH BORE THE AIR OF A FIELD OF BATTLE
AFTER THE JOYS OF THE PRECEDING EVENING
DAME SIR REMARKED BASQUE WE ALL WOKE UP LATE
IS YOUR MASTER UP ASKED JEAN VALJEAN
HOW IS MONSIEUR'S ARM REPLIED BASQUE
BETTER
IS YOUR MASTER UP
WHICH ONE THE OLD ONE OR THE NEW ONE
MONSIEUR PONTMERCY
MONSIEUR LE BARON SAID BASQUE DRAWING HIMSELF UP
A MAN IS A BARON MOST OF ALL TO HIS SERVANTS
HE COUNTS FOR SOMETHING
WITH THEM THEY ARE WHAT A PHILOSOPHER WOULD CALL BESPATTERED WITH THE
TITLE AND THAT FLATTERS THEM
MARIUS BE IT SAID IN PASSING A MILITANT
REPUBLICAN AS HE HAD PROVED WAS NOW A BARON IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
A
SMALL REVOLUTION HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE FAMILY IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS TITLE
IT WAS NOW M
GILLENORMAND WHO CLUNG TO IT AND MARIUS WHO
DETACHED HIMSELF FROM IT
BUT COLONEL PONTMERCY HAD WRITTEN MY SON
WILL BEAR MY TITLE MARIUS OBEYED
AND THEN COSETTE IN WHOM THE WOMAN
WAS BEGINNING TO DAWN WAS DELIGHTED TO BE A BARONESS
MONSIEUR LE BARON REPEATED BASQUE
I WILL GO AND SEE
I WILL TELL
HIM THAT M
FAUCHELEVENT IS HERE
NO
DO NOT TELL HIM THAT IT IS I
TELL HIM THAT SOME ONE WISHES TO
SPEAK TO HIM IN PRIVATE AND MENTION NO NAME
AH EJACULATED BASQUE
I WISH TO SURPRISE HIM
AH EJACULATED BASQUE ONCE MORE EMITTING HIS SECOND AH AS AN
EXPLANATION OF THE FIRST
AND HE LEFT THE ROOM
JEAN VALJEAN REMAINED ALONE
THE DRAWING ROOM AS WE HAVE JUST SAID WAS IN GREAT DISORDER
IT SEEMED
AS THOUGH BY LENDING AN AIR ONE MIGHT STILL HEAR THE VAGUE NOISE OF
THE WEDDING
ON THE POLISHED FLOOR LAY ALL SORTS OF FLOWERS WHICH
HAD FALLEN FROM GARLANDS AND HEAD DRESSES
THE WAX CANDLES BURNED
TO STUMPS ADDED STALACTITES OF WAX TO THE CRYSTAL DROPS OF THE
CHANDELIERS
NOT A SINGLE PIECE OF FURNITURE WAS IN ITS PLACE
IN THE
CORNERS THREE OR FOUR ARM CHAIRS DRAWN CLOSE TOGETHER IN A CIRCLE
HAD THE APPEARANCE OF CONTINUING A CONVERSATION
THE WHOLE EFFECT WAS
CHEERFUL
A CERTAIN GRACE STILL LINGERS ROUND A DEAD FEAST
IT HAS BEEN
A HAPPY THING
ON THE CHAIRS IN DISARRAY AMONG THOSE FADING FLOWERS
BENEATH THOSE EXTINCT LIGHTS PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT OF JOY
THE SUN
HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE CHANDELIER AND MADE ITS WAY GAYLY INTO THE
DRAWING ROOM
SEVERAL MINUTES ELAPSED
JEAN VALJEAN STOOD MOTIONLESS ON THE SPOT WHERE
BASQUE HAD LEFT HIM
HE WAS VERY PALE
HIS EYES WERE HOLLOW AND SO
SUNKEN IN HIS HEAD BY SLEEPLESSNESS THAT THEY NEARLY DISAPPEARED IN
THEIR ORBITS
HIS BLACK COAT BORE THE WEARY FOLDS OF A GARMENT THAT
HAS BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
THE ELBOWS WERE WHITENED WITH THE DOWN WHICH THE
FRICTION OF CLOTH AGAINST LINEN LEAVES BEHIND IT
JEAN VALJEAN STARED AT THE WINDOW OUTLINED ON THE POLISHED FLOOR AT HIS
FEET BY THE SUN
THERE CAME A SOUND AT THE DOOR AND HE RAISED HIS EYES
MARIUS ENTERED HIS HEAD WELL UP HIS MOUTH SMILING AN INDESCRIBABLE
LIGHT ON HIS COUNTENANCE HIS BROW EXPANDED HIS EYES TRIUMPHANT
HE HAD
NOT SLEPT EITHER
IT IS YOU FATHER HE EXCLAIMED ON CATCHING SIGHT OF JEAN VALJEAN
THAT IDIOT OF A BASQUE HAD SUCH A MYSTERIOUS AIR BUT YOU HAVE COME TOO
EARLY
IT IS ONLY HALF PAST TWELVE
COSETTE IS ASLEEP
THAT WORD FATHER SAID TO M
FAUCHELEVENT BY MARIUS SIGNIFIED
SUPREME FELICITY
THERE HAD ALWAYS EXISTED AS THE READER KNOWS A LOFTY
WALL A COLDNESS AND A CONSTRAINT BETWEEN THEM ICE WHICH MUST BE BROKEN
OR MELTED
MARIUS HAD REACHED THAT POINT OF INTOXICATION WHEN THE WALL
WAS LOWERED WHEN THE ICE DISSOLVED AND WHEN M
FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO
HIM AS TO COSETTE A FATHER
HE CONTINUED HIS WORDS POURED FORTH AS IS THE PECULIARITY OF DIVINE
PAROXYSMS OF JOY
HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW WE MISSED YOU YESTERDAY
GOOD MORNING FATHER
HOW IS YOUR HAND BETTER IS IT NOT
AND SATISFIED WITH THE FAVORABLE REPLY WHICH HE HAD MADE TO HIMSELF HE
PURSUED
WE HAVE BOTH BEEN TALKING ABOUT YOU
COSETTE LOVES YOU SO DEARLY YOU
MUST NOT FORGET THAT YOU HAVE A CHAMBER HERE WE WANT NOTHING MORE TO
DO WITH THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME
WE WILL HAVE NO MORE OF IT AT ALL
HOW
COULD YOU GO TO LIVE IN A STREET LIKE THAT WHICH IS SICKLY WHICH IS
DISAGREEABLE WHICH IS UGLY WHICH HAS A BARRIER AT ONE END WHERE ONE
IS COLD AND INTO WHICH ONE CANNOT ENTER YOU ARE TO COME AND INSTALL
YOURSELF HERE
AND THIS VERY DAY
OR YOU WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH COSETTE
SHE MEANS TO LEAD US ALL BY THE NOSE I WARN YOU
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
CHAMBER HERE IT IS CLOSE TO OURS IT OPENS ON THE GARDEN THE TROUBLE
WITH THE CLOCK HAS BEEN ATTENDED TO THE BED IS MADE IT IS ALL READY
YOU HAVE ONLY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT
NEAR YOUR BED COSETTE HAS PLACED
A HUGE OLD EASY CHAIR COVERED WITH UTRECHT VELVET AND SHE HAS SAID TO
IT 'STRETCH OUT YOUR ARMS TO HIM A NIGHTINGALE COMES TO THE CLUMP OF
ACACIAS OPPOSITE YOUR WINDOWS EVERY SPRING
IN TWO MONTHS MORE YOU WILL
HAVE IT
YOU WILL HAVE ITS NEST ON YOUR LEFT AND OURS ON YOUR RIGHT
BY
NIGHT IT WILL SING AND BY DAY COSETTE WILL PRATTLE
YOUR CHAMBER FACES
DUE SOUTH
COSETTE WILL ARRANGE YOUR BOOKS FOR YOU YOUR VOYAGES OF
CAPTAIN COOK AND THE OTHER VANCOUVER'S AND ALL YOUR AFFAIRS
I BELIEVE
THAT THERE IS A LITTLE VALISE TO WHICH YOU ARE ATTACHED I HAVE FIXED
UPON A CORNER OF HONOR FOR THAT
YOU HAVE CONQUERED MY GRANDFATHER YOU
SUIT HIM
WE WILL LIVE TOGETHER
DO YOU PLAY WHIST YOU WILL OVERWHELM
MY GRANDFATHER WITH DELIGHT IF YOU PLAY WHIST
IT IS YOU WHO SHALL TAKE
COSETTE TO WALK ON THE DAYS WHEN I AM AT THE COURTS YOU SHALL GIVE HER
YOUR ARM YOU KNOW AS YOU USED TO IN THE LUXEMBOURG
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY
RESOLVED TO BE HAPPY
AND YOU SHALL BE INCLUDED IN IT IN OUR HAPPINESS
DO YOU HEAR FATHER COME WILL YOU BREAKFAST WITH US TO DAY
SIR SAID JEAN VALJEAN I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU
I AM AN
EX CONVICT
THE LIMIT OF SHRILL SOUNDS PERCEPTIBLE CAN BE OVERLEAPED AS WELL IN
THE CASE OF THE MIND AS IN THAT OF THE EAR
THESE WORDS I AM AN
EX CONVICT PROCEEDING FROM THE MOUTH OF M
FAUCHELEVENT AND ENTERING
THE EAR OF MARIUS OVERSHOT THE POSSIBLE
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SOMETHING
HAD JUST BEEN SAID TO HIM BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT
HE STOOD WITH HIS
MOUTH WIDE OPEN
THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT THE MAN WHO WAS ADDRESSING HIM WAS FRIGHTFUL
WHOLLY ABSORBED IN HIS OWN DAZZLED STATE HE HAD NOT UP TO THAT MOMENT
OBSERVED THE OTHER MAN'S TERRIBLE PALLOR
JEAN VALJEAN UNTIED THE BLACK CRAVAT WHICH SUPPORTED HIS RIGHT ARM
UNROLLED THE LINEN FROM AROUND HIS HAND BARED HIS THUMB AND SHOWED IT
TO MARIUS
THERE IS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY HAND SAID HE
MARIUS LOOKED AT THE THUMB
THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH IT WENT ON JEAN VALJEAN
THERE WAS IN FACT NO TRACE OF ANY INJURY
JEAN VALJEAN CONTINUED
IT WAS FITTING THAT I SHOULD BE ABSENT FROM YOUR MARRIAGE
I ABSENTED
MYSELF AS MUCH AS WAS IN MY POWER
SO I INVENTED THIS INJURY IN ORDER
THAT I MIGHT NOT COMMIT A FORGERY THAT I MIGHT NOT INTRODUCE A FLAW
INTO THE MARRIAGE DOCUMENTS IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT ESCAPE FROM SIGNING
MARIUS STAMMERED
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS
THE MEANING OF IT IS REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN THAT I HAVE BEEN IN THE
GALLEYS
YOU ARE DRIVING ME MAD EXCLAIMED MARIUS IN TERROR
MONSIEUR PONTMERCY SAID JEAN VALJEAN I WAS NINETEEN YEARS IN THE
GALLEYS
FOR THEFT
THEN I WAS CONDEMNED FOR LIFE FOR THEFT FOR A
SECOND OFFENCE
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT I HAVE BROKEN MY BAN
IN VAIN DID MARIUS RECOIL BEFORE THE REALITY REFUSE THE FACT RESIST
THE EVIDENCE HE WAS FORCED TO GIVE WAY
HE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND AND AS
ALWAYS HAPPENS IN SUCH CASES HE UNDERSTOOD TOO MUCH
AN INWARD SHUDDER
OF HIDEOUS ENLIGHTENMENT FLASHED THROUGH HIM AN IDEA WHICH MADE HIM
QUIVER TRAVERSED HIS MIND
HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A WRETCHED DESTINY FOR
HIMSELF IN THE FUTURE
SAY ALL SAY ALL HE CRIED
YOU ARE COSETTE'S FATHER
AND HE RETREATED A COUPLE OF PACES WITH A MOVEMENT OF INDESCRIBABLE
HORROR
JEAN VALJEAN ELEVATED HIS HEAD WITH SO MUCH MAJESTY OF ATTITUDE THAT HE
SEEMED TO GROW EVEN TO THE CEILING
IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU SHOULD BELIEVE ME HERE SIR ALTHOUGH OUR OATH
TO OTHERS MAY NOT BE RECEIVED IN LAW
HERE HE PAUSED THEN WITH A SORT OF SOVEREIGN AND SEPULCHRAL AUTHORITY
HE ADDED ARTICULATING SLOWLY AND EMPHASIZING THE SYLLABLES
YOU WILL BELIEVE ME
I THE FATHER OF COSETTE BEFORE GOD NO
MONSIEUR LE BARON PONTMERCY I AM A PEASANT OF FAVEROLLES
I EARNED MY
LIVING BY PRUNING TREES
MY NAME IS NOT FAUCHELEVENT BUT JEAN VALJEAN
I AM NOT RELATED TO COSETTE
REASSURE YOURSELF
MARIUS STAMMERED
WHO WILL PROVE THAT TO ME
I
SINCE I TELL YOU SO
MARIUS LOOKED AT THE MAN
HE WAS MELANCHOLY YET TRANQUIL
NO LIE COULD
PROCEED FROM SUCH A CALM
THAT WHICH IS ICY IS SINCERE
THE TRUTH COULD
BE FELT IN THAT CHILL OF THE TOMB
I BELIEVE YOU SAID MARIUS
JEAN VALJEAN BENT HIS HEAD AS THOUGH TAKING NOTE OF THIS AND
CONTINUED
WHAT AM I TO COSETTE A PASSER BY
TEN YEARS AGO I DID NOT KNOW THAT
SHE WAS IN EXISTENCE
I LOVE HER IT IS TRUE
ONE LOVES A CHILD WHOM ONE
HAS SEEN WHEN VERY YOUNG BEING OLD ONESELF
WHEN ONE IS OLD ONE FEELS
ONESELF A GRANDFATHER TOWARDS ALL LITTLE CHILDREN
YOU MAY IT SEEMS TO
ME SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE SOMETHING WHICH RESEMBLES A HEART
SHE WAS AN
ORPHAN
WITHOUT EITHER FATHER OR MOTHER
SHE NEEDED ME
THAT IS WHY I
BEGAN TO LOVE HER
CHILDREN ARE SO WEAK THAT THE FIRST COMER EVEN A MAN
LIKE ME CAN BECOME THEIR PROTECTOR
I HAVE FULFILLED THIS DUTY TOWARDS
COSETTE
I DO NOT THINK THAT SO SLIGHT A THING CAN BE CALLED A GOOD
ACTION BUT IF IT BE A GOOD ACTION WELL SAY THAT I HAVE DONE IT
REGISTER THIS ATTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE
TO DAY COSETTE PASSES OUT OF MY
LIFE OUR TWO ROADS PART
HENCEFORTH I CAN DO NOTHING FOR HER
SHE IS
MADAME PONTMERCY
HER PROVIDENCE HAS CHANGED
AND COSETTE GAINS BY THE
CHANGE
ALL IS WELL
AS FOR THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS YOU DO NOT
MENTION THEM TO ME BUT I FORESTALL YOUR THOUGHT THEY ARE A DEPOSIT
HOW DID THAT DEPOSIT COME INTO MY HANDS WHAT DOES THAT MATTER I
RESTORE THE DEPOSIT
NOTHING MORE CAN BE DEMANDED OF ME
I COMPLETE
THE RESTITUTION BY ANNOUNCING MY TRUE NAME
THAT CONCERNS ME
I HAVE A
REASON FOR DESIRING THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHO I AM
AND JEAN VALJEAN LOOKED MARIUS FULL IN THE FACE
ALL THAT MARIUS EXPERIENCED WAS TUMULTUOUS AND INCOHERENT
CERTAIN GUSTS
OF DESTINY PRODUCE THESE BILLOWS IN OUR SOULS
WE HAVE ALL UNDERGONE MOMENTS OF TROUBLE IN WHICH EVERYTHING WITHIN US
IS DISPERSED WE SAY THE FIRST THINGS THAT OCCUR TO US WHICH ARE
NOT ALWAYS PRECISELY THOSE WHICH SHOULD BE SAID
THERE ARE SUDDEN
REVELATIONS WHICH ONE CANNOT BEAR AND WHICH INTOXICATE LIKE BALEFUL
WINE
MARIUS WAS STUPEFIED BY THE NOVEL SITUATION WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF
TO HIM TO THE POINT OF ADDRESSING THAT MAN ALMOST LIKE A PERSON WHO WAS
ANGRY WITH HIM FOR THIS AVOWAL
BUT WHY HE EXCLAIMED DO YOU TELL ME ALL THIS WHO FORCES YOU TO
DO SO YOU COULD HAVE KEPT YOUR SECRET TO YOURSELF
YOU ARE NEITHER
DENOUNCED NOR TRACKED NOR PURSUED
YOU HAVE A REASON FOR WANTONLY
MAKING SUCH A REVELATION
CONCLUDE
THERE IS SOMETHING MORE
IN WHAT
CONNECTION DO YOU MAKE THIS CONFESSION WHAT IS YOUR MOTIVE
MY MOTIVE REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN IN A VOICE SO LOW AND DULL THAT ONE
WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF RATHER THAN TO MARIUS
FROM WHAT MOTIVE IN FACT HAS THIS CONVICT JUST SAID 'I AM A CONVICT'
WELL YES THE MOTIVE IS STRANGE
IT IS OUT OF HONESTY
STAY THE
UNFORTUNATE POINT IS THAT I HAVE A THREAD IN MY HEART WHICH KEEPS ME
FAST
IT IS WHEN ONE IS OLD THAT THAT SORT OF THREAD IS PARTICULARLY
SOLID
ALL LIFE FALLS IN RUIN AROUND ONE ONE RESISTS
HAD I BEEN ABLE
TO TEAR OUT THAT THREAD TO BREAK IT TO UNDO THE KNOT OR TO CUT IT TO
GO FAR AWAY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE
I HAD ONLY TO GO AWAY THERE ARE
DILIGENCES IN THE RUE BOULOY YOU ARE HAPPY I AM GOING
I HAVE TRIED
TO BREAK THAT THREAD I HAVE JERKED AT IT IT WOULD NOT BREAK I TORE MY
HEART WITH IT
THEN I SAID 'I CANNOT LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE THAN HERE I
MUST STAY
WELL YES YOU ARE RIGHT I AM A FOOL WHY NOT SIMPLY
REMAIN HERE YOU OFFER ME A CHAMBER IN THIS HOUSE MADAME PONTMERCY IS
SINCERELY ATTACHED TO ME SHE SAID TO THE ARM CHAIR 'STRETCH OUT YOUR
ARMS TO HIM YOUR GRANDFATHER DEMANDS NOTHING BETTER THAN TO HAVE ME I
SUIT HIM WE SHALL LIVE TOGETHER AND TAKE OUR MEALS IN COMMON I SHALL
GIVE COSETTE MY ARM
MADAME PONTMERCY EXCUSE ME IT IS A HABIT WE
SHALL HAVE BUT ONE ROOF ONE TABLE ONE FIRE THE SAME CHIMNEY CORNER
IN WINTER THE SAME PROMENADE IN SUMMER THAT IS JOY THAT IS HAPPINESS
THAT IS EVERYTHING
WE SHALL LIVE AS ONE FAMILY
ONE FAMILY
AT THAT WORD JEAN VALJEAN BECAME WILD
HE FOLDED HIS ARMS GLARED AT
THE FLOOR BENEATH HIS FEET AS THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE EXCAVATED AN ABYSS
THEREIN AND HIS VOICE SUDDENLY ROSE IN THUNDERING TONES
AS ONE FAMILY NO
I BELONG TO NO FAMILY
I DO NOT BELONG TO YOURS
I DO NOT BELONG TO ANY FAMILY OF MEN
IN HOUSES WHERE PEOPLE ARE AMONG
THEMSELVES I AM SUPERFLUOUS
THERE ARE FAMILIES BUT THERE IS NOTHING
OF THE SORT FOR ME
I AM AN UNLUCKY WRETCH I AM LEFT OUTSIDE
DID I
HAVE A FATHER AND MOTHER I ALMOST DOUBT IT
ON THE DAY WHEN I GAVE THAT
CHILD IN MARRIAGE ALL CAME TO AN END
I HAVE SEEN HER HAPPY AND THAT
SHE IS WITH A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES AND THAT THERE EXISTS HERE A KIND OLD
MAN A HOUSEHOLD OF TWO ANGELS AND ALL JOYS IN THAT HOUSE AND THAT IT
WAS WELL I SAID TO MYSELF 'ENTER THOU NOT I COULD HAVE LIED IT IS
TRUE HAVE DECEIVED YOU ALL AND REMAINED MONSIEUR FAUCHELEVENT
SO LONG
AS IT WAS FOR HER I COULD LIE BUT NOW IT WOULD BE FOR MYSELF AND I
MUST NOT
IT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR ME TO HOLD MY PEACE IT IS TRUE AND ALL
WOULD GO ON
YOU ASK ME WHAT HAS FORCED ME TO SPEAK A VERY ODD THING
MY CONSCIENCE
TO HOLD MY PEACE WAS VERY EASY HOWEVER
I PASSED THE
NIGHT IN TRYING TO PERSUADE MYSELF TO IT YOU QUESTIONED ME AND WHAT I
HAVE JUST SAID TO YOU IS SO EXTRAORDINARY THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO
IT WELL YES I HAVE PASSED THE NIGHT IN ALLEGING REASONS TO MYSELF
AND I GAVE MYSELF VERY GOOD REASONS I HAVE DONE WHAT I COULD
BUT THERE
ARE TWO THINGS IN WHICH I HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN BREAKING THE THREAD
THAT HOLDS ME FIXED RIVETED AND SEALED HERE BY THE HEART OR IN
SILENCING SOME ONE WHO SPEAKS SOFTLY TO ME WHEN I AM ALONE
THAT IS WHY
I HAVE COME HITHER TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING THIS MORNING
EVERYTHING OR
NEARLY EVERYTHING
IT IS USELESS TO TELL YOU THAT WHICH CONCERNS ONLY
MYSELF I KEEP THAT TO MYSELF
YOU KNOW THE ESSENTIAL POINTS
SO I HAVE
TAKEN MY MYSTERY AND HAVE BROUGHT IT TO YOU
AND I HAVE DISEMBOWELLED MY
SECRET BEFORE YOUR EYES
IT WAS NOT A RESOLUTION THAT WAS EASY TO TAKE
I STRUGGLED ALL NIGHT LONG
AH YOU THINK THAT I DID NOT TELL MYSELF
THAT THIS WAS NO CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIR THAT BY CONCEALING MY NAME I WAS
DOING NO ONE ANY INJURY THAT THE NAME OF FAUCHELEVENT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO
ME BY FAUCHELEVENT HIMSELF OUT OF GRATITUDE FOR A SERVICE RENDERED TO
HIM AND THAT I MIGHT ASSUREDLY KEEP IT AND THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY IN
THAT CHAMBER WHICH YOU OFFER ME THAT I SHOULD NOT BE IN ANY ONE'S WAY
THAT I SHOULD BE IN MY OWN LITTLE CORNER AND THAT WHILE YOU WOULD HAVE
COSETTE I SHOULD HAVE THE IDEA THAT I WAS IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER
EACH ONE OF US WOULD HAVE HAD HIS SHARE OF HAPPINESS
IF I CONTINUED TO
BE MONSIEUR FAUCHELEVENT THAT WOULD ARRANGE EVERYTHING
YES WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF MY SOUL
THERE WAS JOY EVERYWHERE UPON MY SURFACE BUT THE
BOTTOM OF MY SOUL REMAINED BLACK
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE HAPPY ONE MUST
BE CONTENT
THUS I SHOULD HAVE REMAINED MONSIEUR FAUCHELEVENT THUS
I SHOULD HAVE CONCEALED MY TRUE VISAGE THUS IN THE PRESENCE OF YOUR
EXPANSION I SHOULD HAVE HAD AN ENIGMA THUS IN THE MIDST OF YOUR FULL
NOONDAY I SHOULD HAVE HAD SHADOWS THUS WITHOUT CRYING ''WARE I
SHOULD HAVE SIMPLY INTRODUCED THE GALLEYS TO YOUR FIRESIDE I SHOULD
HAVE TAKEN MY SEAT AT YOUR TABLE WITH THE THOUGHT THAT IF YOU KNEW WHO
I WAS YOU WOULD DRIVE ME FROM IT I SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED MYSELF TO
BE SERVED BY DOMESTICS WHO HAD THEY KNOWN WOULD HAVE SAID 'HOW
HORRIBLE I SHOULD HAVE TOUCHED YOU WITH MY ELBOW WHICH YOU HAVE A
RIGHT TO DISLIKE I SHOULD HAVE FILCHED YOUR CLASPS OF THE HAND THERE
WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN YOUR HOUSE A DIVISION OF RESPECT BETWEEN VENERABLE
WHITE LOCKS AND TAINTED WHITE LOCKS AT YOUR MOST INTIMATE HOURS WHEN
ALL HEARTS THOUGHT THEMSELVES OPEN TO THE VERY BOTTOM TO ALL THE REST
WHEN WE FOUR WERE TOGETHER YOUR GRANDFATHER YOU TWO AND MYSELF A
STRANGER WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SIDE BY SIDE WITH
YOU IN YOUR EXISTENCE HAVING FOR MY ONLY CARE NOT TO DISARRANGE THE
COVER OF MY DREADFUL PIT
THUS I A DEAD MAN SHOULD HAVE THRUST MYSELF
UPON YOU WHO ARE LIVING BEINGS
I SHOULD HAVE CONDEMNED HER TO MYSELF
FOREVER
YOU AND COSETTE AND I WOULD HAVE HAD ALL THREE OF OUR HEADS IN
THE GREEN CAP DOES IT NOT MAKE YOU SHUDDER I AM ONLY THE MOST CRUSHED
OF MEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST MONSTROUS OF MEN
AND I SHOULD HAVE
COMMITTED THAT CRIME EVERY DAY AND I SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT FACE OF NIGHT
UPON MY VISAGE EVERY DAY EVERY DAY AND I SHOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED TO
YOU A SHARE IN MY TAINT EVERY DAY EVERY DAY TO YOU MY DEARLY BELOVED
MY CHILDREN TO YOU MY INNOCENT CREATURES IS IT NOTHING TO HOLD ONE'S
PEACE IS IT A SIMPLE MATTER TO KEEP SILENCE NO IT IS NOT SIMPLE
THERE IS A SILENCE WHICH LIES
AND MY LIE AND MY FRAUD AND MY
INDIGNITY AND MY COWARDICE AND MY TREASON AND MY CRIME I SHOULD HAVE
DRAINED DROP BY DROP I SHOULD HAVE SPIT IT OUT THEN SWALLOWED IT
AGAIN I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED AT MIDNIGHT AND HAVE BEGUN AGAIN AT
MIDDAY AND MY 'GOOD MORNING' WOULD HAVE LIED AND MY 'GOOD NIGHT' WOULD
HAVE LIED AND I SHOULD HAVE SLEPT ON IT I SHOULD HAVE EATEN IT WITH
MY BREAD AND I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED COSETTE IN THE FACE AND I SHOULD
HAVE RESPONDED TO THE SMILE OF THE ANGEL BY THE SMILE OF THE DAMNED
SOUL AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ABOMINABLE VILLAIN WHY SHOULD I DO
IT IN ORDER TO BE HAPPY
IN ORDER TO BE HAPPY
HAVE I THE RIGHT TO BE
HAPPY I STAND OUTSIDE OF LIFE SIR
JEAN VALJEAN PAUSED
MARIUS LISTENED
SUCH CHAINS OF IDEAS AND OF
ANGUISHES CANNOT BE INTERRUPTED
JEAN VALJEAN LOWERED HIS VOICE ONCE
MORE BUT IT WAS NO LONGER A DULL VOICE IT WAS A SINISTER VOICE
YOU ASK WHY I SPEAK I AM NEITHER DENOUNCED NOR PURSUED NOR TRACKED
YOU SAY
YES I AM DENOUNCED YES I AM TRACKED BY WHOM BY MYSELF
IT IS I WHO BAR THE PASSAGE TO MYSELF AND I DRAG MYSELF AND I PUSH
MYSELF AND I ARREST MYSELF AND I EXECUTE MYSELF AND WHEN ONE HOLDS
ONESELF ONE IS FIRMLY HELD
AND SEIZING A HANDFUL OF HIS OWN COAT BY THE NAPE OF THE NECK AND
EXTENDING IT TOWARDS MARIUS
DO YOU SEE THAT FIST HE CONTINUED
DON'T YOU THINK THAT IT HOLDS
THAT COLLAR IN SUCH A WISE AS NOT TO RELEASE IT WELL CONSCIENCE
IS ANOTHER GRASP IF ONE DESIRES TO BE HAPPY SIR ONE MUST NEVER
UNDERSTAND DUTY FOR AS SOON AS ONE HAS COMPREHENDED IT IT IS
IMPLACABLE
ONE WOULD SAY THAT IT PUNISHED YOU FOR COMPREHENDING IT
BUT NO IT REWARDS YOU FOR IT PLACES YOU IN A HELL WHERE YOU FEEL GOD
BESIDE YOU
ONE HAS NO SOONER LACERATED HIS OWN ENTRAILS THAN HE IS AT
PEACE WITH HIMSELF
AND WITH A POIGNANT ACCENT HE ADDED
MONSIEUR PONTMERCY THIS IS NOT COMMON SENSE I AM AN HONEST MAN
IT IS
BY DEGRADING MYSELF IN YOUR EYES THAT I ELEVATE MYSELF IN MY OWN
THIS
HAS HAPPENED TO ME ONCE BEFORE BUT IT WAS LESS PAINFUL THEN IT WAS
A MERE NOTHING
YES AN HONEST MAN
I SHOULD NOT BE SO IF THROUGH MY
FAULT YOU HAD CONTINUED TO ESTEEM ME NOW THAT YOU DESPISE ME I AM SO
I HAVE THAT FATALITY HANGING OVER ME THAT NOT BEING ABLE TO EVER HAVE
ANYTHING BUT STOLEN CONSIDERATION THAT CONSIDERATION HUMILIATES ME
AND CRUSHES ME INWARDLY AND IN ORDER THAT I MAY RESPECT MYSELF IT IS
NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD BE DESPISED
THEN I STRAIGHTEN UP AGAIN
I AM
A GALLEY SLAVE WHO OBEYS HIS CONSCIENCE
I KNOW WELL THAT THAT IS MOST
IMPROBABLE
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO ABOUT IT IT IS THE FACT
I HAVE ENTERED INTO ENGAGEMENTS WITH MYSELF I KEEP THEM
THERE ARE
ENCOUNTERS WHICH BIND US THERE ARE CHANCES WHICH INVOLVE US IN DUTIES
YOU SEE MONSIEUR PONTMERCY VARIOUS THINGS HAVE HAPPENED TO ME IN THE
COURSE OF MY LIFE
AGAIN JEAN VALJEAN PAUSED SWALLOWING HIS SALIVA WITH AN EFFORT AS
THOUGH HIS WORDS HAD A BITTER AFTER TASTE AND THEN HE WENT ON
WHEN ONE HAS SUCH A HORROR HANGING OVER ONE ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO
MAKE OTHERS SHARE IT WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO
MAKE THEM SLIP OVER ONE'S OWN PRECIPICE WITHOUT THEIR PERCEIVING IT
ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO LET ONE'S RED BLOUSE DRAG UPON THEM ONE HAS NO
RIGHT TO SLYLY ENCUMBER WITH ONE'S MISERY THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS
IT IS
HIDEOUS TO APPROACH THOSE WHO ARE HEALTHY AND TO TOUCH THEM IN THE DARK
WITH ONE'S ULCER
IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT FAUCHELEVENT LENT ME HIS
NAME I HAVE NO RIGHT TO USE IT HE COULD GIVE IT TO ME BUT I COULD NOT
TAKE IT
A NAME IS AN I
YOU SEE SIR THAT I HAVE THOUGHT SOMEWHAT I
HAVE READ A LITTLE ALTHOUGH I AM A PEASANT AND YOU SEE THAT I
EXPRESS MYSELF PROPERLY
I UNDERSTAND THINGS
I HAVE PROCURED MYSELF AN
EDUCATION
WELL YES TO ABSTRACT A NAME AND TO PLACE ONESELF UNDER IT
IS DISHONEST
LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET CAN BE FILCHED LIKE A PURSE OR A
WATCH
TO BE A FALSE SIGNATURE IN FLESH AND BLOOD TO BE A LIVING FALSE
KEY TO ENTER THE HOUSE OF HONEST PEOPLE BY PICKING THEIR LOCK NEVER
MORE TO LOOK STRAIGHTFORWARD TO FOREVER EYE ASKANCE TO BE INFAMOUS
WITHIN THE I NO NO NO NO NO IT IS BETTER TO SUFFER TO BLEED TO
WEEP TO TEAR ONE'S SKIN FROM THE FLESH WITH ONE'S NAILS TO PASS NIGHTS
WRITHING IN ANGUISH TO DEVOUR ONESELF BODY AND SOUL
THAT IS WHY I HAVE
JUST TOLD YOU ALL THIS
WANTONLY AS YOU SAY
HE DREW A PAINFUL BREATH AND HURLED THIS FINAL WORD
IN DAYS GONE BY I STOLE A LOAF OF BREAD IN ORDER TO LIVE TO DAY IN
ORDER TO LIVE I WILL NOT STEAL A NAME
TO LIVE INTERRUPTED MARIUS
YOU DO NOT NEED THAT NAME IN ORDER TO
LIVE
AH I UNDERSTAND THE MATTER SAID JEAN VALJEAN RAISING AND LOWERING
HIS HEAD SEVERAL TIMES IN SUCCESSION
A SILENCE ENSUED
BOTH HELD THEIR PEACE EACH PLUNGED IN A GULF OF
THOUGHTS
MARIUS WAS SITTING NEAR A TABLE AND RESTING THE CORNER OF HIS
MOUTH ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS WHICH WAS FOLDED BACK
JEAN VALJEAN WAS
PACING TO AND FRO
HE PAUSED BEFORE A MIRROR AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS
THEN AS THOUGH REPLYING TO SOME INWARD COURSE OF REASONING HE SAID AS
HE GAZED AT THE MIRROR WHICH HE DID NOT SEE
WHILE AT PRESENT I AM RELIEVED
HE TOOK UP HIS MARCH AGAIN AND WALKED TO THE OTHER END OF THE
DRAWING ROOM
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE TURNED ROUND HE PERCEIVED THAT
MARIUS WAS WATCHING HIS WALK
THEN HE SAID WITH AN INEXPRESSIBLE
INTONATION
I DRAG MY LEG A LITTLE
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY
THEN HE TURNED FULLY ROUND TOWARDS MARIUS
AND NOW SIR IMAGINE THIS I HAVE SAID NOTHING I HAVE REMAINED
MONSIEUR FAUCHELEVENT I HAVE TAKEN MY PLACE IN YOUR HOUSE I AM ONE OF
YOU I AM IN MY CHAMBER I COME TO BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING IN SLIPPERS
IN THE EVENING ALL THREE OF US GO TO THE PLAY I ACCOMPANY MADAME
PONTMERCY TO THE TUILERIES AND TO THE PLACE ROYALE WE ARE TOGETHER
YOU THINK ME YOUR EQUAL ONE FINE DAY YOU ARE THERE AND I AM THERE WE
ARE CONVERSING WE ARE LAUGHING ALL AT ONCE YOU HEAR A VOICE SHOUTING
THIS NAME 'JEAN VALJEAN AND BEHOLD THAT TERRIBLE HAND THE POLICE
DARTS FROM THE DARKNESS AND ABRUPTLY TEARS OFF MY MASK
AGAIN HE PAUSED MARIUS HAD SPRUNG TO HIS FEET WITH A SHUDDER
JEAN
VALJEAN RESUMED
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT
MARIUS' SILENCE ANSWERED FOR HIM
JEAN VALJEAN CONTINUED
YOU SEE THAT I AM RIGHT IN NOT HOLDING MY PEACE
BE HAPPY BE
IN HEAVEN BE THE ANGEL OF AN ANGEL EXIST IN THE SUN BE CONTENT
THEREWITH AND DO NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THE MEANS WHICH A POOR
DAMNED WRETCH TAKES TO OPEN HIS BREAST AND FORCE HIS DUTY TO COME FORTH
YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU SIR A WRETCHED MAN
MARIUS SLOWLY CROSSED THE ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS QUITE CLOSE TO JEAN
VALJEAN HE OFFERED THE LATTER HIS HAND
BUT MARIUS WAS OBLIGED TO STEP UP AND TAKE THAT HAND WHICH WAS NOT
OFFERED JEAN VALJEAN LET HIM HAVE HIS OWN WAY AND IT SEEMED TO MARIUS
THAT HE PRESSED A HAND OF MARBLE
MY GRANDFATHER HAS FRIENDS SAID MARIUS I WILL PROCURE YOUR PARDON
IT IS USELESS REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN
I AM BELIEVED TO BE DEAD AND
THAT SUFFICES
THE DEAD ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO SURVEILLANCE
THEY ARE
SUPPOSED TO ROT IN PEACE
DEATH IS THE SAME THING AS PARDON
AND DISENGAGING THE HAND WHICH MARIUS HELD HE ADDED WITH A SORT OF
INEXORABLE DIGNITY
MOREOVER THE FRIEND TO WHOM I HAVE RECOURSE IS THE DOING OF MY DUTY
AND I NEED BUT ONE PARDON THAT OF MY CONSCIENCE
AT THAT MOMENT A DOOR AT THE OTHER END OF THE DRAWING ROOM OPENED
GENTLY HALF WAY AND IN THE OPENING COSETTE'S HEAD APPEARED
THEY SAW
ONLY HER SWEET FACE HER HAIR WAS IN CHARMING DISORDER HER EYELIDS WERE
STILL SWOLLEN WITH SLEEP
SHE MADE THE MOVEMENT OF A BIRD WHICH THRUSTS
ITS HEAD OUT OF ITS NEST GLANCED FIRST AT HER HUSBAND THEN AT JEAN
VALJEAN AND CRIED TO THEM WITH A SMILE SO THAT THEY SEEMED TO BEHOLD A
SMILE AT THE HEART OF A ROSE
I WILL WAGER THAT YOU ARE TALKING POLITICS
HOW STUPID THAT IS INSTEAD
OF BEING WITH ME
JEAN VALJEAN SHUDDERED
COSETTE
STAMMERED MARIUS
AND HE PAUSED
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THEY WERE TWO CRIMINALS
COSETTE WHO WAS RADIANT CONTINUED TO GAZE AT BOTH OF THEM
THERE WAS
SOMETHING IN HER EYES LIKE GLEAMS OF PARADISE
I HAVE CAUGHT YOU IN THE VERY ACT SAID COSETTE
JUST NOW I HEARD MY
FATHER FAUCHELEVENT THROUGH THE DOOR SAYING 'CONSCIENCE
DOING MY
DUTY
THAT IS POLITICS INDEED IT IS
I WILL NOT HAVE IT
PEOPLE

IT IS NOT RIGHT
YOU ARE MISTAKEN
COSETTE SAID MARIUS WE ARE TALKING BUSINESS
WE
ARE DISCUSSING THE BEST INVESTMENT OF YOUR SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
FRANCS
THAT IS NOT IT AT ALL INTERRUPTED COSETTE
I AM COMING
DOES ANY
BODY WANT ME HERE
AND PASSING RESOLUTELY THROUGH THE DOOR SHE ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM
SHE WAS DRESSED IN A VOLUMINOUS WHITE DRESSING GOWN WITH A THOUSAND
FOLDS AND LARGE SLEEVES WHICH STARTING FROM THE NECK FELL TO HER FEET
IN THE GOLDEN HEAVENS OF SOME ANCIENT GOTHIC PICTURES THERE ARE THESE
CHARMING SACKS FIT TO CLOTHE THE ANGELS
SHE CONTEMPLATED HERSELF FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN A LONG MIRROR THEN
EXCLAIMED IN AN OUTBURST OF INEFFABLE ECSTASY
THERE WAS ONCE A KING AND A QUEEN
OH HOW HAPPY I AM
THAT SAID SHE MADE A CURTSEY TO MARIUS AND TO JEAN VALJEAN
THERE SAID SHE I AM GOING TO INSTALL MYSELF NEAR YOU IN AN
EASY CHAIR WE BREAKFAST IN HALF AN HOUR YOU SHALL SAY ANYTHING YOU
LIKE I KNOW WELL THAT MEN MUST TALK AND I WILL BE VERY GOOD
MARIUS TOOK HER BY THE ARM AND SAID LOVINGLY TO HER
WE ARE TALKING BUSINESS
BY THE WAY SAID COSETTE I HAVE OPENED MY WINDOW A FLOCK OF
PIERROTS HAS ARRIVED IN THE GARDEN BIRDS NOT MASKERS
TO DAY IS
ASH WEDNESDAY BUT NOT FOR THE BIRDS
I TELL YOU THAT WE ARE TALKING BUSINESS GO MY LITTLE COSETTE LEAVE
US ALONE FOR A MOMENT
WE ARE TALKING FIGURES
THAT WILL BORE YOU
YOU HAVE A CHARMING CRAVAT ON THIS MORNING MARIUS

DANDIFIED MONSEIGNEUR
NO IT WILL NOT BORE ME
I ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL BORE YOU
NO
SINCE IT IS YOU
I SHALL NOT UNDERSTAND YOU BUT I SHALL LISTEN
TO YOU
WHEN ONE HEARS THE VOICES OF THOSE WHOM ONE LOVES ONE DOES NOT
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE WORDS THAT THEY UTTER
THAT WE SHOULD BE HERE
TOGETHER THAT IS ALL THAT I DESIRE
I SHALL REMAIN WITH YOU BAH

YES
VERY GOOD SAID COSETTE
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU SOME NEWS

AT MASS THAT THE CHIMNEY IN MY FATHER FAUCHELEVENT'S ROOM SMOKES THAT
NICOLETTE HAS SENT FOR THE CHIMNEY SWEEP THAT TOUSSAINT AND NICOLETTE
HAVE ALREADY QUARRELLED THAT NICOLETTE MAKES SPORT OF TOUSSAINT'S
STAMMER
WELL YOU SHALL KNOW NOTHING

THEN WHO
WILL BE CAUGHT I BESEECH YOU MY LITTLE MARIUS LET ME STAY HERE WITH
YOU TWO
I SWEAR TO YOU THAT IT IS INDISPENSABLE THAT WE SHOULD BE ALONE
WELL AM I ANYBODY
JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT UTTERED A SINGLE WORD
COSETTE TURNED TO HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE FATHER I WANT YOU TO COME AND EMBRACE ME
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN BY NOT SAYING ANYTHING INSTEAD OF TAKING MY PART WHO GAVE ME
SUCH A FATHER AS THAT YOU MUST PERCEIVE THAT MY FAMILY LIFE IS VERY
UNHAPPY
MY HUSBAND BEATS ME
COME EMBRACE ME INSTANTLY
JEAN VALJEAN APPROACHED
COSETTE TURNED TOWARD MARIUS
AS FOR YOU I SHALL MAKE A FACE AT YOU
THEN SHE PRESENTED HER BROW TO JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN ADVANCED A STEP TOWARD HER
COSETTE RECOILED
FATHER YOU ARE PALE
DOES YOUR ARM HURT YOU
IT IS WELL SAID JEAN VALJEAN
DID YOU SLEEP BADLY
NO
ARE YOU SAD
NO
EMBRACE ME IF YOU ARE WELL IF YOU SLEEP WELL IF YOU ARE CONTENT I
WILL NOT SCOLD YOU
AND AGAIN SHE OFFERED HIM HER BROW
JEAN VALJEAN DROPPED A KISS UPON THAT BROW WHEREON RESTED A CELESTIAL
GLEAM
SMILE
JEAN VALJEAN OBEYED
IT WAS THE SMILE OF A SPECTRE
NOW DEFEND ME AGAINST MY HUSBAND
COSETTE
EJACULATED MARIUS
GET ANGRY FATHER
SAY THAT I MUST STAY
YOU CAN CERTAINLY TALK BEFORE
ME
SO YOU THINK ME VERY SILLY
WHAT YOU SAY IS ASTONISHING BUSINESS
PLACING MONEY IN A BANK A GREAT MATTER TRULY
MEN MAKE MYSTERIES OUT OF
NOTHING
I AM VERY PRETTY THIS MORNING
LOOK AT ME MARIUS
AND WITH AN ADORABLE SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS AND AN INDESCRIBABLY
EXQUISITE POUT SHE GLANCED AT MARIUS
I LOVE YOU SAID MARIUS
I ADORE YOU SAID COSETTE
AND THEY FELL IRRESISTIBLY INTO EACH OTHER'S ARMS
NOW SAID COSETTE ADJUSTING A FOLD OF HER DRESSING GOWN WITH A
TRIUMPHANT LITTLE GRIMACE I SHALL STAY
NO NOT THAT SAID MARIUS IN A SUPPLICATING TONE
WE HAVE TO FINISH
SOMETHING
STILL NO
MARIUS ASSUMED A GRAVE TONE
I ASSURE YOU COSETTE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
AH YOU PUT ON YOUR MAN'S VOICE SIR
THAT IS WELL I GO
YOU FATHER
HAVE NOT UPHELD ME
MONSIEUR MY FATHER MONSIEUR MY HUSBAND YOU ARE
TYRANTS
I SHALL GO AND TELL GRANDPAPA
IF YOU THINK THAT I AM GOING TO
RETURN AND TALK PLATITUDES TO YOU YOU ARE MISTAKEN
I AM PROUD
I SHALL
WAIT FOR YOU NOW
YOU SHALL SEE THAT IT IS YOU WHO ARE GOING TO BE
BORED WITHOUT ME
I AM GOING IT IS WELL
AND SHE LEFT THE ROOM
TWO SECONDS LATER THE DOOR OPENED ONCE MORE HER FRESH AND ROSY HEAD
WAS AGAIN THRUST BETWEEN THE TWO LEAVES AND SHE CRIED TO THEM
I AM VERY ANGRY INDEED
THE DOOR CLOSED AGAIN AND THE SHADOWS DESCENDED ONCE MORE
IT WAS AS THOUGH A RAY OF SUNLIGHT SHOULD HAVE SUDDENLY TRAVERSED THE
NIGHT WITHOUT ITSELF BEING CONSCIOUS OF IT
MARIUS MADE SURE THAT THE DOOR WAS SECURELY CLOSED
POOR COSETTE HE MURMURED WHEN SHE FINDS OUT
AT THAT WORD JEAN VALJEAN TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB
HE FIXED ON MARIUS A
BEWILDERED EYE
COSETTE OH YES IT IS TRUE YOU ARE GOING TO TELL COSETTE ABOUT THIS
THAT IS RIGHT
STAY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT
ONE HAS THE STRENGTH FOR
ONE THING BUT NOT FOR ANOTHER
SIR I CONJURE YOU I ENTREAT NOW SIR
GIVE ME YOUR MOST SACRED WORD OF HONOR THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL HER
IS
IT NOT ENOUGH THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW IT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY IT MYSELF
WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO IT I COULD HAVE TOLD IT TO THE UNIVERSE TO THE
WHOLE WORLD IT WAS ALL ONE TO ME
BUT SHE SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT
IT IS IT WOULD TERRIFY HER
WHAT A CONVICT WE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO
EXPLAIN MATTERS TO HER TO SAY TO HER 'HE IS A MAN WHO HAS BEEN IN THE
GALLEYS SHE SAW THE CHAIN GANG PASS BY ONE DAY
OH MY GOD
HE
DROPPED INTO AN ARM CHAIR AND HID HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
HIS GRIEF WAS NOT AUDIBLE BUT FROM THE QUIVERING OF HIS SHOULDERS IT
WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS WEEPING
SILENT TEARS TERRIBLE TEARS
THERE IS SOMETHING OF SUFFOCATION IN THE SOB
HE WAS SEIZED WITH A SORT
OF CONVULSION HE THREW HIMSELF AGAINST THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AS THOUGH
TO GAIN BREATH LETTING HIS ARMS FALL AND ALLOWING MARIUS TO SEE HIS
FACE INUNDATED WITH TEARS AND MARIUS HEARD HIM MURMUR SO LOW THAT HIS
VOICE SEEMED TO ISSUE FROM FATHOMLESS DEPTHS
OH WOULD THAT I COULD DIE
BE AT YOUR EASE SAID MARIUS I WILL KEEP YOUR SECRET FOR MYSELF
ALONE AND LESS TOUCHED PERHAPS THAN HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN BUT
FORCED FOR THE LAST HOUR TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH SOMETHING
AS UNEXPECTED AS IT WAS DREADFUL GRADUALLY BEHOLDING THE CONVICT
SUPERPOSED BEFORE HIS VERY EYES UPON M
FAUCHELEVENT OVERCOME
LITTLE BY LITTLE BY THAT LUGUBRIOUS REALITY AND LED BY THE NATURAL
INCLINATION OF THE SITUATION TO RECOGNIZE THE SPACE WHICH HAD JUST BEEN
PLACED BETWEEN THAT MAN AND HIMSELF MARIUS ADDED
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD NOT SPEAK A WORD TO YOU WITH REGARD TO
THE DEPOSIT WHICH YOU HAVE SO FAITHFULLY AND HONESTLY REMITTED
THAT IS
AN ACT OF PROBITY
IT IS JUST THAT SOME RECOMPENSE SHOULD BE BESTOWED ON
YOU
FIX THE SUM YOURSELF IT SHALL BE COUNTED OUT TO YOU
DO NOT FEAR
TO SET IT VERY HIGH
I THANK YOU SIR REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN GENTLY
HE REMAINED IN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT MECHANICALLY PASSING THE TIP OF HIS
FORE FINGER ACROSS HIS THUMB NAIL THEN HE LIFTED UP HIS VOICE
ALL IS NEARLY OVER
BUT ONE LAST THING REMAINS FOR ME
WHAT IS IT
JEAN VALJEAN STRUGGLED WITH WHAT SEEMED A LAST HESITATION AND WITHOUT
VOICE WITHOUT BREATH HE STAMMERED RATHER THAN SAID
NOW THAT YOU KNOW DO YOU THINK SIR YOU WHO ARE THE MASTER THAT I
OUGHT NOT TO SEE COSETTE ANY MORE
I THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER REPLIED MARIUS COLDLY
I SHALL NEVER SEE HER MORE MURMURED JEAN VALJEAN
AND HE DIRECTED HIS
STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR
HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE KNOB THE LATCH YIELDED THE DOOR OPENED
JEAN
VALJEAN PUSHED IT OPEN FAR ENOUGH TO PASS THROUGH STOOD MOTIONLESS FOR
A SECOND THEN CLOSED THE DOOR AGAIN AND TURNED TO MARIUS
HE WAS NO LONGER PALE HE WAS LIVID
THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY TEARS
IN HIS EYES BUT ONLY A SORT OF TRAGIC FLAME
HIS VOICE HAD REGAINED A
STRANGE COMPOSURE
STAY SIR HE SAID
IF YOU WILL ALLOW IT I WILL COME TO SEE HER
I
ASSURE YOU THAT I DESIRE IT GREATLY
IF I HAD NOT CARED TO SEE COSETTE
I SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE TO YOU THE CONFESSION THAT I HAVE MADE I SHOULD
HAVE GONE AWAY BUT AS I DESIRED TO REMAIN IN THE PLACE WHERE COSETTE
IS AND TO CONTINUE TO SEE HER I HAD TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT HONESTLY
YOU
FOLLOW MY REASONING DO YOU NOT IT IS A MATTER EASILY UNDERSTOOD
YOU
SEE I HAVE HAD HER WITH ME FOR MORE THAN NINE YEARS
WE LIVED FIRST
IN THAT HUT ON THE BOULEVARD THEN IN THE CONVENT THEN NEAR THE
LUXEMBOURG
THAT WAS WHERE YOU SAW HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU REMEMBER
HER BLUE PLUSH HAT
THEN WE WENT TO THE QUARTIER DES INVALIDES WHERE
THERE WAS A RAILING ON A GARDEN THE RUE PLUMET
I LIVED IN A LITTLE
BACK COURT YARD WHENCE I COULD HEAR HER PIANO
THAT WAS MY LIFE
WE
NEVER LEFT EACH OTHER
THAT LASTED FOR NINE YEARS AND SOME MONTHS
I
WAS LIKE HER OWN FATHER AND SHE WAS MY CHILD
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER
YOU UNDERSTAND MONSIEUR PONTMERCY BUT TO GO AWAY NOW NEVER TO SEE HER
AGAIN NEVER TO SPEAK TO HER AGAIN TO NO LONGER HAVE ANYTHING WOULD
BE HARD
IF YOU DO NOT DISAPPROVE OF IT I WILL COME TO SEE COSETTE FROM
TIME TO TIME
I WILL NOT COME OFTEN
I WILL NOT REMAIN LONG
YOU SHALL
GIVE ORDERS THAT I AM TO BE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE WAITING ROOM
ON THE
GROUND FLOOR
I COULD ENTER PERFECTLY WELL BY THE BACK DOOR BUT THAT
MIGHT CREATE SURPRISE PERHAPS AND IT WOULD BE BETTER I THINK FOR ME
TO ENTER BY THE USUAL DOOR
TRULY SIR I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE
MORE OF COSETTE
AS RARELY AS YOU PLEASE
PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT BUT THAT
AND THEN WE MUST BE CAUTIOUS
IF I
NO LONGER COME AT ALL IT WOULD PRODUCE A BAD EFFECT IT WOULD BE
CONSIDERED SINGULAR
WHAT I CAN DO BY THE WAY IS TO COME IN THE
AFTERNOON WHEN NIGHT IS BEGINNING TO FALL
YOU SHALL COME EVERY EVENING SAID MARIUS AND COSETTE WILL BE
WAITING FOR YOU
YOU ARE KIND SIR SAID JEAN VALJEAN
MARIUS SALUTED JEAN VALJEAN HAPPINESS ESCORTED DESPAIR TO THE DOOR AND
THESE TWO MEN PARTED
CHAPTER II THE OBSCURITIES WHICH A REVELATION CAN CONTAIN
MARIUS WAS QUITE UPSET
THE SORT OF ESTRANGEMENT WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS FELT TOWARDS THE MAN BESIDE
WHOM HE HAD SEEN COSETTE WAS NOW EXPLAINED TO HIM
THERE WAS SOMETHING
ENIGMATIC ABOUT THAT PERSON OF WHICH HIS INSTINCT HAD WARNED HIM
THIS ENIGMA WAS THE MOST HIDEOUS OF DISGRACES THE GALLEYS
THIS M
FAUCHELEVENT WAS THE CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN
TO ABRUPTLY FIND SUCH A SECRET IN THE MIDST OF ONE'S HAPPINESS RESEMBLES
THE DISCOVERY OF A SCORPION IN A NEST OF TURTLEDOVES
WAS THE HAPPINESS OF MARIUS AND COSETTE THENCEFORTH CONDEMNED TO SUCH A
NEIGHBORHOOD WAS THIS AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT DID THE ACCEPTANCE OF THAT
MAN FORM A PART OF THE MARRIAGE NOW CONSUMMATED WAS THERE NOTHING TO BE
DONE
HAD MARIUS WEDDED THE CONVICT AS WELL
IN VAIN MAY ONE BE CROWNED WITH LIGHT AND JOY IN VAIN MAY ONE TASTE THE
GRAND PURPLE HOUR OF LIFE HAPPY LOVE SUCH SHOCKS WOULD FORCE EVEN THE
ARCHANGEL IN HIS ECSTASY EVEN THE DEMIGOD IN HIS GLORY TO SHUDDER
AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE IN CHANGES OF VIEW OF THIS NATURE MARIUS ASKED
HIMSELF WHETHER HE HAD NOTHING WITH WHICH TO REPROACH HIMSELF
HAD HE
BEEN WANTING IN DIVINATION HAD HE BEEN WANTING IN PRUDENCE HAD HE
INVOLUNTARILY DULLED HIS WITS A LITTLE PERHAPS
HAD HE ENTERED UPON
THIS LOVE AFFAIR WHICH HAD ENDED IN HIS MARRIAGE TO COSETTE WITHOUT
TAKING SUFFICIENT PRECAUTIONS TO THROW LIGHT UPON THE SURROUNDINGS HE
ADMITTED IT IS THUS BY A SERIES OF SUCCESSIVE ADMISSIONS OF OURSELVES
IN REGARD TO OURSELVES THAT LIFE AMENDS US LITTLE BY LITTLE HE
ADMITTED THE CHIMERICAL AND VISIONARY SIDE OF HIS NATURE A SORT OF
INTERNAL CLOUD PECULIAR TO MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND WHICH IN PAROXYSMS
OF PASSION AND SORROW DILATES AS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SOUL CHANGES
AND INVADES THE ENTIRE MAN TO SUCH A DEGREE AS TO RENDER HIM NOTHING
MORE THAN A CONSCIENCE BATHED IN A MIST
WE HAVE MORE THAN ONCE
INDICATED THIS CHARACTERISTIC ELEMENT OF MARIUS' INDIVIDUALITY
HE RECALLED THAT IN THE INTOXICATION OF HIS LOVE IN THE RUE PLUMET
DURING THOSE SIX OR SEVEN ECSTATIC WEEKS HE HAD NOT EVEN SPOKE TO
COSETTE OF THAT DRAMA IN THE GORBEAU HOVEL WHERE THE VICTIM HAD TAKEN
UP SUCH A SINGULAR LINE OF SILENCE DURING THE STRUGGLE AND THE ENSUING
FLIGHT
HOW HAD IT HAPPENED THAT HE HAD NOT MENTIONED THIS TO COSETTE
YET IT WAS SO NEAR AND SO TERRIBLE HOW HAD IT COME TO PASS THAT HE HAD
NOT EVEN NAMED THE THENARDIERS AND PARTICULARLY ON THE DAY WHEN HE
HAD ENCOUNTERED EPONINE HE NOW FOUND IT ALMOST DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN HIS
SILENCE OF THAT TIME
NEVERTHELESS HE COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT
HE RECALLED
HIS BENUMBED STATE HIS INTOXICATION WITH COSETTE LOVE ABSORBING
EVERYTHING THAT CATCHING AWAY OF EACH OTHER INTO THE IDEAL AND PERHAPS
ALSO LIKE THE IMPERCEPTIBLE QUANTITY OF REASON MINGLED WITH THIS
VIOLENT AND CHARMING STATE OF THE SOUL A VAGUE DULL INSTINCT IMPELLING
HIM TO CONCEAL AND ABOLISH IN HIS MEMORY THAT REDOUBTABLE ADVENTURE
CONTACT WITH WHICH HE DREADED IN WHICH HE DID NOT WISH TO PLAY ANY
PART HIS AGENCY IN WHICH HE HAD KEPT SECRET AND IN WHICH HE COULD BE
NEITHER NARRATOR NOR WITNESS WITHOUT BEING AN ACCUSER
MOREOVER THESE FEW WEEKS HAD BEEN A FLASH OF LIGHTNING THERE HAD BEEN
NO TIME FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT LOVE
IN SHORT HAVING WEIGHED EVERYTHING TURNED EVERYTHING OVER IN HIS MIND
EXAMINED EVERYTHING WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CONSEQUENCES IF HE HAD
TOLD COSETTE ABOUT THE GORBEAU AMBUSH EVEN IF HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT
JEAN VALJEAN WAS A CONVICT WOULD THAT HAVE CHANGED HIM MARIUS WOULD
THAT HAVE CHANGED HER COSETTE WOULD HE HAVE DRAWN BACK WOULD HE HAVE
ADORED HER ANY THE LESS WOULD HE HAVE REFRAINED FROM MARRYING HER NO
THEN THERE WAS NOTHING TO REGRET NOTHING WITH WHICH HE NEED REPROACH
HIMSELF
ALL WAS WELL
THERE IS A DEITY FOR THOSE DRUNKEN MEN WHO ARE
CALLED LOVERS
MARIUS BLIND HAD FOLLOWED THE PATH WHICH HE WOULD HAVE
CHOSEN HAD HE BEEN IN FULL POSSESSION OF HIS SIGHT
LOVE HAD BANDAGED
HIS EYES IN ORDER TO LEAD HIM WHITHER TO PARADISE
BUT THIS PARADISE WAS HENCEFORTH COMPLICATED WITH AN INFERNAL
ACCOMPANIMENT
MARIUS' ANCIENT ESTRANGEMENT TOWARDS THIS MAN TOWARDS THIS FAUCHELEVENT
WHO HAD TURNED INTO JEAN VALJEAN WAS AT PRESENT MINGLED WITH HORROR
IN THIS HORROR LET US STATE THERE WAS SOME PITY AND EVEN A CERTAIN
SURPRISE
THIS THIEF THIS THIEF GUILTY OF A SECOND OFFENCE HAD RESTORED THAT
DEPOSIT
AND WHAT A DEPOSIT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
HE ALONE WAS IN THE SECRET OF THAT DEPOSIT
HE MIGHT HAVE KEPT IT ALL
HE HAD RESTORED IT ALL
MOREOVER HE HAD HIMSELF REVEALED HIS SITUATION
NOTHING FORCED HIM TO
THIS
IF ANY ONE LEARNED WHO HE WAS IT WAS THROUGH HIMSELF
IN THIS
AVOWAL THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN ACCEPTANCE OF HUMILIATION THERE
WAS ACCEPTANCE OF PERIL
FOR A CONDEMNED MAN A MASK IS NOT A MASK IT
IS A SHELTER
A FALSE NAME IS SECURITY AND HE HAD REJECTED THAT FALSE
NAME
HE THE GALLEY SLAVE MIGHT HAVE HIDDEN HIMSELF FOREVER IN AN
HONEST FAMILY HE HAD WITHSTOOD THIS TEMPTATION
AND WITH WHAT MOTIVE
THROUGH A CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLE
HE HIMSELF EXPLAINED THIS WITH THE
IRRESISTIBLE ACCENTS OF TRUTH
IN SHORT WHATEVER THIS JEAN VALJEAN
MIGHT BE HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A CONSCIENCE WHICH WAS AWAKENING
THERE
EXISTED SOME MYSTERIOUS RE HABILITATION WHICH HAD BEGUN AND TO ALL
APPEARANCES SCRUPLES HAD FOR A LONG TIME ALREADY CONTROLLED THIS MAN
SUCH FITS OF JUSTICE AND GOODNESS ARE NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF VULGAR
NATURES
AN AWAKENING OF CONSCIENCE IS GRANDEUR OF SOUL
JEAN VALJEAN WAS SINCERE
THIS SINCERITY VISIBLE PALPABLE
IRREFRAGABLE EVIDENT FROM THE VERY GRIEF THAT IT CAUSED HIM RENDERED
INQUIRIES USELESS AND CONFERRED AUTHORITY ON ALL THAT THAT MAN HAD
SAID
HERE FOR MARIUS THERE WAS A STRANGE REVERSAL OF SITUATIONS
WHAT
BREATHED FROM M
FAUCHELEVENT DISTRUST
WHAT DID JEAN VALJEAN INSPIRE
CONFIDENCE
IN THE MYSTERIOUS BALANCE OF THIS JEAN VALJEAN WHICH THE PENSIVE MARIUS
STRUCK HE ADMITTED THE ACTIVE PRINCIPLE HE ADMITTED THE PASSIVE
PRINCIPLE AND HE TRIED TO REACH A BALANCE
BUT ALL THIS WENT ON AS IN A STORM
MARIUS WHILE ENDEAVORING TO FORM A
CLEAR IDEA OF THIS MAN AND WHILE PURSUING JEAN VALJEAN SO TO SPEAK IN
THE DEPTHS OF HIS THOUGHT LOST HIM AND FOUND HIM AGAIN IN A FATAL MIST
THE DEPOSIT HONESTLY RESTORED THE PROBITY OF THE CONFESSION THESE WERE
GOOD
THIS PRODUCED A LIGHTENING OF THE CLOUD THEN THE CLOUD BECAME
BLACK ONCE MORE
TROUBLED AS WERE MARIUS' MEMORIES A SHADOW OF THEM RETURNED TO HIM
AFTER ALL WHAT WAS THAT ADVENTURE IN THE JONDRETTE ATTIC WHY HAD THAT
MAN TAKEN TO FLIGHT ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE INSTEAD OF ENTERING A
COMPLAINT
HERE MARIUS FOUND THE ANSWER
BECAUSE THAT MAN WAS A FUGITIVE FROM
JUSTICE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS BAN
ANOTHER QUESTION WHY HAD THAT MAN COME TO THE BARRICADE
FOR MARIUS NOW ONCE MORE DISTINCTLY BEHELD THAT RECOLLECTION WHICH HAD
RE APPEARED IN HIS EMOTIONS LIKE SYMPATHETIC INK AT THE APPLICATION OF
HEAT
THIS MAN HAD BEEN IN THE BARRICADE
HE HAD NOT FOUGHT THERE
WHAT
HAD HE COME THERE FOR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS QUESTION A SPECTRE SPRANG
UP AND REPLIED JAVERT
MARIUS RECALLED PERFECTLY NOW THAT FUNEREAL SIGHT OF JEAN VALJEAN
DRAGGING THE PINIONED JAVERT OUT OF THE BARRICADE AND HE STILL HEARD
BEHIND THE CORNER OF THE LITTLE RUE MONDETOUR THAT FRIGHTFUL PISTOL
SHOT
OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS HATRED BETWEEN THAT POLICE SPY AND THE
GALLEY SLAVE
THE ONE WAS IN THE OTHER'S WAY
JEAN VALJEAN HAD GONE TO
THE BARRICADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENGING HIMSELF
HE HAD ARRIVED LATE
HE PROBABLY KNEW THAT JAVERT WAS A PRISONER THERE
THE CORSICAN VENDETTA
HAS PENETRATED TO CERTAIN LOWER STRATA AND HAS BECOME THE LAW THERE IT
IS SO SIMPLE THAT IT DOES NOT ASTONISH SOULS WHICH ARE BUT HALF TURNED
TOWARDS GOOD AND THOSE HEARTS ARE SO CONSTITUTED THAT A CRIMINAL WHO
IS IN THE PATH OF REPENTANCE MAY BE SCRUPULOUS IN THE MATTER OF THEFT
AND UNSCRUPULOUS IN THE MATTER OF VENGEANCE
JEAN VALJEAN HAD KILLED
JAVERT
AT LEAST THAT SEEMED TO BE EVIDENT
THIS WAS THE FINAL QUESTION TO BE SURE BUT TO THIS THERE WAS NO REPLY
THIS QUESTION MARIUS FELT LIKE PINCERS
HOW HAD IT COME TO PASS THAT
JEAN VALJEAN'S EXISTENCE HAD ELBOWED THAT OF COSETTE FOR SO LONG A
PERIOD
WHAT MELANCHOLY SPORT OF PROVIDENCE WAS THAT WHICH HAD PLACED THAT CHILD
IN CONTACT WITH THAT MAN ARE THERE THEN CHAINS FOR TWO WHICH ARE FORGED
ON HIGH AND DOES GOD TAKE PLEASURE IN COUPLING THE ANGEL WITH THE
DEMON SO A CRIME AND AN INNOCENCE CAN BE ROOM MATES IN THE MYSTERIOUS
GALLEYS OF WRETCHEDNESS IN THAT DEFILING OF CONDEMNED PERSONS WHICH
IS CALLED HUMAN DESTINY CAN TWO BROWS PASS SIDE BY SIDE THE ONE
INGENUOUS THE OTHER FORMIDABLE THE ONE ALL BATHED IN THE DIVINE
WHITENESS OF DAWN THE OTHER FOREVER BLEMISHED BY THE FLASH OF AN
ETERNAL LIGHTNING WHO COULD HAVE ARRANGED THAT INEXPLICABLE PAIRING
OFF IN WHAT MANNER IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT PRODIGY HAD ANY COMMUNITY
OF LIFE BEEN ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THIS CELESTIAL LITTLE CREATURE AND THAT
OLD CRIMINAL
WHO COULD HAVE BOUND THE LAMB TO THE WOLF AND WHAT WAS STILL MORE
INCOMPREHENSIBLE HAVE ATTACHED THE WOLF TO THE LAMB FOR THE WOLF LOVED
THE LAMB FOR THE FIERCE CREATURE ADORED THE FEEBLE ONE FOR DURING
THE SPACE OF NINE YEARS THE ANGEL HAD HAD THE MONSTER AS HER POINT OF
SUPPORT
COSETTE'S CHILDHOOD AND GIRLHOOD HER ADVENT IN THE DAYLIGHT
HER VIRGINAL GROWTH TOWARDS LIFE AND LIGHT HAD BEEN SHELTERED BY
THAT HIDEOUS DEVOTION
HERE QUESTIONS EXFOLIATED SO TO SPEAK INTO
INNUMERABLE ENIGMAS ABYSSES YAWNED AT THE BOTTOMS OF ABYSSES AND
MARIUS COULD NO LONGER BEND OVER JEAN VALJEAN WITHOUT BECOMING DIZZY
WHAT WAS THIS MAN PRECIPICE
THE OLD SYMBOLS OF GENESIS ARE ETERNAL IN HUMAN SOCIETY SUCH AS IT NOW
EXISTS AND UNTIL A BROADER DAY SHALL EFFECT A CHANGE IN IT THERE WILL
ALWAYS BE TWO MEN THE ONE SUPERIOR THE OTHER SUBTERRANEAN THE ONE
WHICH IS ACCORDING TO GOOD IS ABEL THE OTHER WHICH IS ACCORDING TO EVIL
IS CAIN
WHAT WAS THIS TENDER CAIN WHAT WAS THIS RUFFIAN RELIGIOUSLY
ABSORBED IN THE ADORATION OF A VIRGIN WATCHING OVER HER REARING HER
GUARDING HER DIGNIFYING HER AND ENVELOPING HER IMPURE AS HE WAS
HIMSELF WITH PURITY
WHAT WAS THAT CESS POOL WHICH HAD VENERATED THAT INNOCENCE TO SUCH A
POINT AS NOT TO LEAVE UPON IT A SINGLE SPOT WHAT WAS THIS JEAN VALJEAN
EDUCATING COSETTE WHAT WAS THIS FIGURE OF THE SHADOWS WHICH HAD FOR ITS
ONLY OBJECT THE PRESERVATION OF THE RISING OF A STAR FROM EVERY SHADOW
AND FROM EVERY CLOUD
THAT WAS JEAN VALJEAN'S SECRET THAT WAS ALSO GOD'S SECRET
IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS DOUBLE SECRET MARIUS RECOILED
THE ONE IN SOME
SORT REASSURED HIM AS TO THE OTHER
GOD WAS AS VISIBLE IN THIS AFFAIR
AS WAS JEAN VALJEAN
GOD HAS HIS INSTRUMENTS
HE MAKES USE OF THE TOOL
WHICH HE WILLS
HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE TO MEN
DO WE KNOW HOW GOD SETS
ABOUT THE WORK JEAN VALJEAN HAD LABORED OVER COSETTE
HE HAD TO SOME
EXTENT MADE THAT SOUL
THAT WAS INCONTESTABLE
WELL WHAT THEN THE
WORKMAN WAS HORRIBLE BUT THE WORK WAS ADMIRABLE
GOD PRODUCES HIS
MIRACLES AS SEEMS GOOD TO HIM
HE HAD CONSTRUCTED THAT CHARMING COSETTE
AND HE HAD EMPLOYED JEAN VALJEAN
IT HAD PLEASED HIM TO CHOOSE THIS
STRANGE COLLABORATOR FOR HIMSELF
WHAT ACCOUNT HAVE WE TO DEMAND OF HIM
IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE DUNG HEAP HAS AIDED THE SPRING TO CREATE
THE ROSE
MARIUS MADE HIMSELF THESE REPLIES AND DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT THEY
WERE GOOD
HE HAD NOT DARED TO PRESS JEAN VALJEAN ON ALL THE POINTS
WHICH WE HAVE JUST INDICATED BUT HE DID NOT CONFESS TO HIMSELF THAT HE
DID NOT DARE TO DO IT
HE ADORED COSETTE HE POSSESSED COSETTE COSETTE
WAS SPLENDIDLY PURE
THAT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM
WHAT ENLIGHTENMENT DID
HE NEED COSETTE WAS A LIGHT
DOES LIGHT REQUIRE ENLIGHTENMENT HE HAD
EVERYTHING WHAT MORE COULD HE DESIRE ALL IS NOT THAT ENOUGH JEAN
VALJEAN'S PERSONAL AFFAIRS DID NOT CONCERN HIM
AND BENDING OVER THE FATAL SHADOW OF THAT MAN HE CLUNG FAST
CONVULSIVELY TO THE SOLEMN DECLARATION OF THAT UNHAPPY WRETCH I
AM NOTHING TO COSETTE
TEN YEARS AGO I DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE WAS IN
EXISTENCE
JEAN VALJEAN WAS A PASSER BY
HE HAD SAID SO HIMSELF
WELL HE HAD
PASSED
WHATEVER HE WAS HIS PART WAS FINISHED
HENCEFORTH THERE REMAINED MARIUS TO FULFIL THE PART OF PROVIDENCE TO
COSETTE
COSETTE HAD SOUGHT THE AZURE IN A PERSON LIKE HERSELF IN HER
LOVER HER HUSBAND HER CELESTIAL MALE
COSETTE AS SHE TOOK HER FLIGHT
WINGED AND TRANSFIGURED LEFT BEHIND HER ON THE EARTH HER HIDEOUS AND
EMPTY CHRYSALIS JEAN VALJEAN
IN WHATEVER CIRCLE OF IDEAS MARIUS REVOLVED HE ALWAYS RETURNED TO A
CERTAIN HORROR FOR JEAN VALJEAN
A SACRED HORROR PERHAPS FOR AS WE
HAVE JUST POINTED OUT HE FELT A QUID DIVINUM IN THAT MAN
BUT DO WHAT
HE WOULD AND SEEK WHAT EXTENUATION HE WOULD HE WAS CERTAINLY FORCED TO
FALL BACK UPON THIS THE MAN WAS A CONVICT THAT IS TO SAY A BEING WHO
HAS NOT EVEN A PLACE IN THE SOCIAL LADDER SINCE HE IS LOWER THAN THE
VERY LOWEST RUNG
AFTER THE VERY LAST OF MEN COMES THE CONVICT
THE
CONVICT IS NO LONGER SO TO SPEAK IN THE SEMBLANCE OF THE LIVING
THE
LAW HAS DEPRIVED HIM OF THE ENTIRE QUANTITY OF HUMANITY OF WHICH IT CAN
DEPRIVE A MAN
MARIUS ON PENAL QUESTIONS STILL HELD TO THE INEXORABLE SYSTEM THOUGH
HE WAS A DEMOCRAT AND HE ENTERTAINED ALL THE IDEAS OF THE LAW ON THE
SUBJECT OF THOSE WHOM THE LAW STRIKES
HE HAD NOT YET ACCOMPLISHED ALL
PROGRESS WE ADMIT
HE HAD NOT YET COME TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THAT
WHICH IS WRITTEN BY MAN AND THAT WHICH IS WRITTEN BY GOD BETWEEN LAW
AND RIGHT
HE HAD NOT EXAMINED AND WEIGHED THE RIGHT WHICH MAN TAKES TO
DISPOSE OF THE IRREVOCABLE AND THE IRREPARABLE
HE WAS NOT SHOCKED BY
THE WORD VINDICTE
HE FOUND IT QUITE SIMPLE THAT CERTAIN BREACHES OF THE
WRITTEN LAW SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY ETERNAL SUFFERING AND HE ACCEPTED
AS THE PROCESS OF CIVILIZATION SOCIAL DAMNATION
HE STILL STOOD AT THIS
POINT THOUGH SAFE TO ADVANCE INFALLIBLY LATER ON SINCE HIS NATURE WAS
GOOD AND AT BOTTOM WHOLLY FORMED OF LATENT PROGRESS
IN THIS STAGE OF HIS IDEAS JEAN VALJEAN APPEARED TO HIM HIDEOUS AND
REPULSIVE
HE WAS A MAN REPROVED HE WAS THE CONVICT
THAT WORD WAS
FOR HIM LIKE THE SOUND OF THE TRUMP ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT AND AFTER
HAVING REFLECTED UPON JEAN VALJEAN FOR A LONG TIME HIS FINAL GESTURE
HAD BEEN TO TURN AWAY HIS HEAD
VADE RETRO
MARIUS IF WE MUST RECOGNIZE AND EVEN INSIST UPON THE FACT WHILE
INTERROGATING JEAN VALJEAN TO SUCH A POINT THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD SAID
YOU ARE CONFESSING ME HAD NOT NEVERTHELESS PUT TO HIM TWO OR THREE
DECISIVE QUESTIONS
IT WAS NOT THAT THEY HAD NOT PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HIS MIND BUT THAT
HE HAD BEEN AFRAID OF THEM
THE JONDRETTE ATTIC THE BARRICADE JAVERT
WHO KNOWS WHERE THESE REVELATIONS WOULD HAVE STOPPED JEAN VALJEAN DID
NOT SEEM LIKE A MAN WHO WOULD DRAW BACK AND WHO KNOWS WHETHER MARIUS
AFTER HAVING URGED HIM ON WOULD NOT HAVE HIMSELF DESIRED TO HOLD HIM
BACK
HAS IT NOT HAPPENED TO ALL OF US IN CERTAIN SUPREME CONJUNCTURES TO
STOP OUR EARS IN ORDER THAT WE MAY NOT HEAR THE REPLY AFTER WE HAVE
ASKED A QUESTION IT IS ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE LOVES THAT ONE GIVES WAY
TO THESE EXHIBITIONS OF COWARDICE
IT IS NOT WISE TO QUESTION SINISTER
SITUATIONS TO THE LAST POINT PARTICULARLY WHEN THE INDISSOLUBLE SIDE OF
OUR LIFE IS FATALLY INTERMINGLED WITH THEM
WHAT A TERRIBLE LIGHT MIGHT
HAVE PROCEEDED FROM THE DESPAIRING EXPLANATIONS OF JEAN VALJEAN AND WHO
KNOWS WHETHER THAT HIDEOUS GLARE WOULD NOT HAVE DARTED FORTH AS FAR
AS COSETTE WHO KNOWS WHETHER A SORT OF INFERNAL GLOW WOULD NOT HAVE
LINGERED BEHIND IT ON THE BROW OF THAT ANGEL THE SPATTERING OF A
LIGHTNING FLASH IS OF THE THUNDER ALSO
FATALITY HAS POINTS OF JUNCTURE
WHERE INNOCENCE ITSELF IS STAMPED WITH CRIME BY THE GLOOMY LAW OF THE
REFLECTIONS WHICH GIVE COLOR
THE PUREST FIGURES MAY FOREVER PRESERVE
THE REFLECTION OF A HORRIBLE ASSOCIATION
RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY MARIUS
HAD BEEN AFRAID
HE ALREADY KNEW TOO MUCH
HE SOUGHT TO DULL HIS SENSES
RATHER THAN TO GAIN FURTHER LIGHT
IN DISMAY HE BORE OFF COSETTE IN HIS ARMS AND SHUT HIS EYES TO JEAN
VALJEAN
THAT MAN WAS THE NIGHT THE LIVING AND HORRIBLE NIGHT
HOW SHOULD HE
DARE TO SEEK THE BOTTOM OF IT IT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO INTERROGATE
THE SHADOW
WHO KNOWS WHAT ITS REPLY WILL BE THE DAWN MAY BE BLACKENED
FOREVER BY IT
IN THIS STATE OF MIND THE THOUGHT THAT THAT MAN WOULD HENCEFORTH COME
INTO ANY CONTACT WHATEVER WITH COSETTE WAS A HEARTRENDING PERPLEXITY TO
MARIUS
HE NOW ALMOST REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR NOT HAVING PUT THOSE FORMIDABLE
QUESTIONS BEFORE WHICH HE HAD RECOILED AND FROM WHICH AN IMPLACABLE
AND DEFINITIVE DECISION MIGHT HAVE SPRUNG
HE FELT THAT HE WAS TOO GOOD
TOO GENTLE TOO WEAK IF WE MUST SAY THE WORD
THIS WEAKNESS HAD LED HIM
TO AN IMPRUDENT CONCESSION
HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE TOUCHED
HE
HAD BEEN IN THE WRONG
HE OUGHT TO HAVE SIMPLY AND PURELY REJECTED
JEAN VALJEAN
JEAN VALJEAN PLAYED THE PART OF FIRE AND THAT IS WHAT HE
SHOULD HAVE DONE AND HAVE FREED HIS HOUSE FROM THAT MAN
HE WAS VEXED WITH HIMSELF HE WAS ANGRY WITH THAT WHIRLWIND OF EMOTIONS
WHICH HAD DEAFENED BLINDED AND CARRIED HIM AWAY
HE WAS DISPLEASED
WITH HIMSELF
WHAT WAS HE TO DO NOW JEAN VALJEAN'S VISITS WERE PROFOUNDLY REPUGNANT
TO HIM
WHAT WAS THE USE IN HAVING THAT MAN IN HIS HOUSE WHAT DID THE
MAN WANT HERE HE BECAME DISMAYED HE DID NOT WISH TO DIG DOWN HE DID
NOT WISH TO PENETRATE DEEPLY HE DID NOT WISH TO SOUND HIMSELF
HE
HAD PROMISED HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DRAWN INTO A PROMISE JEAN
VALJEAN HELD HIS PROMISE ONE MUST KEEP ONE'S WORD EVEN TO A CONVICT
ABOVE ALL TO A CONVICT
STILL HIS FIRST DUTY WAS TO COSETTE
IN SHORT
HE WAS CARRIED AWAY BY THE REPUGNANCE WHICH DOMINATED HIM
MARIUS TURNED OVER ALL THIS CONFUSION OF IDEAS IN HIS MIND PASSING
FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND MOVED BY ALL OF THEM
HENCE AROSE A PROFOUND
TROUBLE
IT WAS NOT EASY FOR HIM TO HIDE THIS TROUBLE FROM COSETTE BUT LOVE IS A
TALENT AND MARIUS SUCCEEDED IN DOING IT
HOWEVER WITHOUT ANY APPARENT OBJECT HE QUESTIONED COSETTE WHO WAS AS
CANDID AS A DOVE IS WHITE AND WHO SUSPECTED NOTHING HE TALKED OF HER
CHILDHOOD AND HER YOUTH AND HE BECAME MORE AND MORE CONVINCED THAT THAT
CONVICT HAD BEEN EVERYTHING GOOD PATERNAL AND RESPECTABLE THAT A MAN
CAN BE TOWARDS COSETTE
ALL THAT MARIUS HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF AND HAD
SURMISED WAS REAL
THAT SINISTER NETTLE HAD LOVED AND PROTECTED THAT
LILY

CHAPTER I THE LOWER CHAMBER
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT NIGHTFALL JEAN VALJEAN KNOCKED AT THE CARRIAGE
GATE OF THE GILLENORMAND HOUSE
IT WAS BASQUE WHO RECEIVED HIM
BASQUE
WAS IN THE COURTYARD AT THE APPOINTED HOUR AS THOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED
HIS ORDERS
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT ONE SAYS TO A SERVANT YOU WILL
WATCH FOR MR
SO AND SO WHEN HE ARRIVES
BASQUE ADDRESSED JEAN VALJEAN WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE LATTER TO APPROACH
HIM
MONSIEUR LE BARON HAS CHARGED ME TO INQUIRE WHETHER MONSIEUR DESIRES TO
GO UPSTAIRS OR TO REMAIN BELOW
I WILL REMAIN BELOW REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN
BASQUE WHO WAS PERFECTLY RESPECTFUL OPENED THE DOOR OF THE
WAITING ROOM AND SAID
I WILL GO AND INFORM MADAME
THE ROOM WHICH JEAN VALJEAN ENTERED WAS A DAMP VAULTED ROOM ON THE
GROUND FLOOR WHICH SERVED AS A CELLAR ON OCCASION WHICH OPENED ON THE
STREET WAS PAVED WITH RED SQUARES AND WAS BADLY LIGHTED BY A GRATED
WINDOW
THIS CHAMBER WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHICH ARE HARASSED BY THE
FEATHER DUSTER THE POPE'S HEAD BRUSH AND THE BROOM
THE DUST RESTED
TRANQUILLY THERE
PERSECUTION OF THE SPIDERS WAS NOT ORGANIZED THERE
A
FINE WEB WHICH SPREAD FAR AND WIDE AND WAS VERY BLACK AND ORNAMENTED
WITH DEAD FLIES FORMED A WHEEL ON ONE OF THE WINDOW PANES
THE ROOM
WHICH WAS SMALL AND LOW CEILED WAS FURNISHED WITH A HEAP OF EMPTY
BOTTLES PILED UP IN ONE CORNER
THE WALL WHICH WAS DAUBED WITH AN OCHRE YELLOW WASH WAS SCALING OFF IN
LARGE FLAKES
AT ONE END THERE WAS A CHIMNEY PIECE PAINTED IN BLACK
WITH A NARROW SHELF
A FIRE WAS BURNING THERE WHICH INDICATED THAT JEAN
VALJEAN'S REPLY I WILL REMAIN BELOW HAD BEEN FORESEEN
TWO ARM CHAIRS WERE PLACED AT THE TWO CORNERS OF THE FIREPLACE
BETWEEN
THE CHAIRS AN OLD BEDSIDE RUG WHICH DISPLAYED MORE FOUNDATION THREAD
THAN WOOL HAD BEEN SPREAD BY WAY OF A CARPET
THE CHAMBER WAS LIGHTED BY THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH AND THE TWILIGHT
FALLING THROUGH THE WINDOW
JEAN VALJEAN WAS FATIGUED
FOR DAYS HE HAD NEITHER EATEN NOR SLEPT
HE
THREW HIMSELF INTO ONE OF THE ARM CHAIRS
BASQUE RETURNED SET A LIGHTED CANDLE ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE AND RETIRED
JEAN VALJEAN HIS HEAD DROOPING AND HIS CHIN RESTING ON HIS BREAST
PERCEIVED NEITHER BASQUE NOR THE CANDLE
ALL AT ONCE HE DREW HIMSELF UP WITH A START
COSETTE WAS STANDING
BESIDE HIM
HE HAD NOT SEEN HER ENTER BUT HE HAD FELT THAT SHE WAS THERE
HE TURNED ROUND
HE GAZED AT HER
SHE WAS ADORABLY LOVELY
BUT WHAT HE
WAS CONTEMPLATING WITH THAT PROFOUND GAZE WAS NOT HER BEAUTY BUT HER
SOUL
WELL EXCLAIMED COSETTE FATHER I KNEW THAT YOU WERE PECULIAR BUT
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED THIS
WHAT AN IDEA MARIUS TOLD ME THAT YOU
WISH ME TO RECEIVE YOU HERE
YES IT IS MY WISH
I EXPECTED THAT REPLY
GOOD
I WARN YOU THAT I AM GOING TO MAKE A SCENE
FOR YOU
LET US BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING
EMBRACE ME FATHER
AND SHE OFFERED HIM HER CHEEK
JEAN VALJEAN REMAINED MOTIONLESS
YOU DO NOT STIR
I TAKE NOTE OF IT
ATTITUDE OF GUILT
BUT NEVER MIND
I PARDON YOU
JESUS CHRIST SAID OFFER THE OTHER CHEEK
HERE IT IS
AND SHE PRESENTED HER OTHER CHEEK
JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT MOVE
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HIS FEET WERE NAILED TO
THE PAVEMENT
THIS IS BECOMING SERIOUS SAID COSETTE
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU I
DECLARE THAT I AM PERPLEXED
YOU OWE ME REPARATION
YOU WILL DINE WITH
US
I HAVE DINED
THAT IS NOT TRUE
I WILL GET M
GILLENORMAND TO SCOLD YOU
GRANDFATHERS
ARE MADE TO REPRIMAND FATHERS
COME
GO UPSTAIRS WITH ME TO THE
DRAWING ROOM
IMMEDIATELY
IMPOSSIBLE
HERE COSETTE LOST GROUND A LITTLE
SHE CEASED TO COMMAND AND PASSED TO
QUESTIONING
BUT WHY AND YOU CHOOSE THE UGLIEST CHAMBER IN THE HOUSE IN WHICH TO
SEE ME
IT'S HORRIBLE HERE
THOU KNOWEST
JEAN VALJEAN CAUGHT HIMSELF UP
YOU KNOW MADAME THAT I AM PECULIAR I HAVE MY FREAKS
COSETTE STRUCK HER TINY HANDS TOGETHER
MADAME
YOU KNOW
MORE NOVELTIES WHAT IS THE MEANING OF
THIS
JEAN VALJEAN DIRECTED UPON HER THAT HEARTRENDING SMILE TO WHICH HE
OCCASIONALLY HAD RECOURSE
YOU WISHED TO BE MADAME
YOU ARE SO
NOT FOR YOU FATHER
DO NOT CALL ME FATHER
WHAT
CALL ME 'MONSIEUR JEAN 'JEAN IF YOU LIKE
YOU ARE NO LONGER MY FATHER I AM NO LONGER COSETTE 'MONSIEUR JEAN'
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN WHY THESE ARE REVOLUTIONS AREN'T THEY WHAT HAS
TAKEN PLACE COME LOOK ME IN THE FACE
AND YOU WON'T LIVE WITH US
AND YOU WON'T HAVE MY CHAMBER WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU HAS ANYTHING
HAPPENED
NOTHING
WELL THEN
EVERYTHING IS AS USUAL
WHY DO YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME
YOU HAVE CHANGED YOURS SURELY
HE SMILED AGAIN WITH THE SAME SMILE AS BEFORE AND ADDED
SINCE YOU ARE MADAME PONTMERCY I CERTAINLY CAN BE MONSIEUR JEAN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT
ALL THIS IS IDIOTIC
I SHALL ASK
PERMISSION OF MY HUSBAND FOR YOU TO BE 'MONSIEUR JEAN I HOPE THAT HE
WILL NOT CONSENT TO IT
YOU CAUSE ME A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN
ONE DOES
HAVE FREAKS BUT ONE DOES NOT CAUSE ONE'S LITTLE COSETTE GRIEF
THAT IS
WRONG
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE WICKED YOU WHO ARE SO GOOD
HE MADE NO REPLY
SHE SEIZED HIS HANDS WITH VIVACITY AND RAISING THEM TO HER FACE WITH
AN IRRESISTIBLE MOVEMENT SHE PRESSED THEM AGAINST HER NECK BENEATH HER
CHIN WHICH IS A GESTURE OF PROFOUND TENDERNESS
OH SHE SAID TO HIM BE GOOD
AND SHE WENT ON
THIS IS WHAT I CALL BEING GOOD BEING NICE AND COMING AND LIVING
HERE THERE ARE BIRDS HERE AS THERE ARE IN THE RUE PLUMET LIVING WITH
US QUITTING THAT HOLE OF A RUE DE L'HOMME ARME NOT GIVING US RIDDLES
TO GUESS BEING LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD DINING WITH US
BREAKFASTING WITH US BEING MY FATHER
HE LOOSED HER HANDS
YOU NO LONGER NEED A FATHER YOU HAVE A HUSBAND
COSETTE BECAME ANGRY
I NO LONGER NEED A FATHER ONE REALLY DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO
THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH ARE NOT COMMON SENSE
IF TOUSSAINT WERE HERE RESUMED JEAN VALJEAN LIKE A PERSON WHO IS
DRIVEN TO SEEK AUTHORITIES AND WHO CLUTCHES AT EVERY BRANCH SHE WOULD
BE THE FIRST TO AGREE THAT IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD WAYS OF MY
OWN
THERE IS NOTHING NEW IN THIS
I ALWAYS HAVE LOVED MY BLACK CORNER
BUT IT IS COLD HERE
ONE CANNOT SEE DISTINCTLY
IT IS ABOMINABLE THAT
IT IS TO WISH TO BE MONSIEUR JEAN I WILL NOT HAVE YOU SAY 'YOU' TO ME
JUST NOW AS I WAS COMING HITHER REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN I SAW A PIECE
OF FURNITURE IN THE RUE SAINT LOUIS
IT WAS AT A CABINET MAKER'S
IF I
WERE A PRETTY WOMAN I WOULD TREAT MYSELF TO THAT BIT OF FURNITURE
A
VERY NEAT TOILET TABLE IN THE REIGNING STYLE
WHAT YOU CALL ROSEWOOD I
THINK
IT IS INLAID
THE MIRROR IS QUITE LARGE
THERE ARE DRAWERS
IT IS
PRETTY
HOU THE VILLAINOUS BEAR REPLIED COSETTE
AND WITH SUPREME GRACE SETTING HER TEETH AND DRAWING BACK HER LIPS SHE
BLEW AT JEAN VALJEAN
SHE WAS A GRACE COPYING A CAT
I AM FURIOUS SHE RESUMED
EVER SINCE YESTERDAY YOU HAVE MADE ME
RAGE ALL OF YOU
I AM GREATLY VEXED
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOU DO NOT
DEFEND ME AGAINST MARIUS
MARIUS WILL NOT UPHOLD ME AGAINST YOU
I AM
ALL ALONE
I ARRANGE A CHAMBER PRETTILY
IF I COULD HAVE PUT THE GOOD
GOD THERE I WOULD HAVE DONE IT
MY CHAMBER IS LEFT ON MY HANDS
MY
LODGER SENDS ME INTO BANKRUPTCY
I ORDER A NICE LITTLE DINNER OF
NICOLETTE
WE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR DINNER MADAME
AND MY
FATHER FAUCHELEVENT WANTS ME TO CALL HIM 'MONSIEUR JEAN AND TO RECEIVE
HIM IN A FRIGHTFUL OLD UGLY CELLAR WHERE THE WALLS HAVE BEARDS AND
WHERE THE CRYSTAL CONSISTS OF EMPTY BOTTLES AND THE CURTAINS ARE OF
SPIDERS' WEBS YOU ARE SINGULAR I ADMIT THAT IS YOUR STYLE BUT PEOPLE
WHO GET MARRIED ARE GRANTED A TRUCE
YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEGUN BEING
SINGULAR AGAIN INSTANTLY
SO YOU ARE GOING TO BE PERFECTLY CONTENTED IN
YOUR ABOMINABLE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME
I WAS VERY DESPERATE INDEED THERE
THAT I WAS
WHAT HAVE YOU AGAINST ME YOU CAUSE ME A GREAT DEAL OF
GRIEF
FI
AND BECOMING SUDDENLY SERIOUS SHE GAZED INTENTLY AT JEAN VALJEAN AND
ADDED
ARE YOU ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE I AM HAPPY
INGENUOUSNESS SOMETIMES UNCONSCIOUSLY PENETRATES DEEP
THIS QUESTION
WHICH WAS SIMPLE FOR COSETTE WAS PROFOUND FOR JEAN VALJEAN
COSETTE HAD
MEANT TO SCRATCH AND SHE LACERATED
JEAN VALJEAN TURNED PALE
HE REMAINED FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT REPLYING THEN WITH AN INEXPRESSIBLE
INTONATION AND SPEAKING TO HIMSELF HE MURMURED
HER HAPPINESS WAS THE OBJECT OF MY LIFE
NOW GOD MAY SIGN MY DISMISSAL
COSETTE THOU ART HAPPY MY DAY IS OVER
AH YOU HAVE SAID THOU TO ME EXCLAIMED COSETTE
AND SHE SPRANG TO HIS NECK
JEAN VALJEAN IN BEWILDERMENT STRAINED HER WILDLY TO HIS BREAST
IT
ALMOST SEEMED TO HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE TAKING HER BACK
THANKS FATHER SAID COSETTE
THIS ENTHUSIASTIC IMPULSE WAS ON THE POINT OF BECOMING POIGNANT FOR JEAN
VALJEAN
HE GENTLY REMOVED COSETTE'S ARMS AND TOOK HIS HAT
WELL SAID COSETTE
I LEAVE YOU MADAME THEY ARE WAITING FOR YOU
AND FROM THE THRESHOLD HE ADDED
I HAVE SAID THOU TO YOU
TELL YOUR HUSBAND THAT THIS SHALL NOT HAPPEN
AGAIN
PARDON ME
JEAN VALJEAN QUITTED THE ROOM LEAVING COSETTE STUPEFIED AT THIS
ENIGMATICAL FAREWELL
CHAPTER II ANOTHER STEP BACKWARDS
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT THE SAME HOUR JEAN VALJEAN CAME
COSETTE ASKED HIM NO QUESTIONS WAS NO LONGER ASTONISHED NO LONGER
EXCLAIMED THAT SHE WAS COLD NO LONGER SPOKE OF THE DRAWING ROOM SHE
AVOIDED SAYING EITHER FATHER OR MONSIEUR JEAN SHE ALLOWED HERSELF
TO BE ADDRESSED AS YOU
SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE CALLED MADAME
ONLY
HER JOY HAD UNDERGONE A CERTAIN DIMINUTION
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAD IF
SADNESS HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO HER
IT IS PROBABLE THAT SHE HAD HAD WITH MARIUS ONE OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS
IN WHICH THE BELOVED MAN SAYS WHAT HE PLEASES EXPLAINS NOTHING AND
SATISFIES THE BELOVED WOMAN
THE CURIOSITY OF LOVERS DOES NOT EXTEND
VERY FAR BEYOND THEIR OWN LOVE
THE LOWER ROOM HAD MADE A LITTLE TOILET
BASQUE HAD SUPPRESSED THE
BOTTLES AND NICOLETTE THE SPIDERS
ALL THE DAYS WHICH FOLLOWED BROUGHT JEAN VALJEAN AT THE SAME HOUR
HE
CAME EVERY DAY BECAUSE HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO TAKE MARIUS' WORDS
OTHERWISE THAN LITERALLY
MARIUS ARRANGED MATTERS SO AS TO BE ABSENT AT
THE HOURS WHEN JEAN VALJEAN CAME
THE HOUSE GREW ACCUSTOMED TO THE NOVEL
WAYS OF M
FAUCHELEVENT
TOUSSAINT HELPED IN THIS DIRECTION MONSIEUR
HAS ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT SHE REPEATED
THE GRANDFATHER ISSUED THIS
DECREE HE'S AN ORIGINAL AND ALL WAS SAID
MOREOVER AT THE AGE OF
NINETY SIX NO BOND IS ANY LONGER POSSIBLE ALL IS MERELY JUXTAPOSITION
A NEWCOMER IS IN THE WAY
THERE IS NO LONGER ANY ROOM ALL HABITS ARE
ACQUIRED
M
FAUCHELEVENT M
TRANCHELEVENT FATHER GILLENORMAND
ASKED NOTHING BETTER THAN TO BE RELIEVED FROM THAT GENTLEMAN HE
ADDED NOTHING IS MORE COMMON THAN THOSE ORIGINALS
THEY DO ALL SORTS
OF QUEER THINGS
THEY HAVE NO REASON
THE MARQUIS DE CANAPLES WAS STILL
WORSE
HE BOUGHT A PALACE THAT HE MIGHT LODGE IN THE GARRET
THESE ARE
FANTASTIC APPEARANCES THAT PEOPLE AFFECT
NO ONE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE SINISTER FOUNDATION
AND MOREOVER WHO
COULD HAVE GUESSED SUCH A THING THERE ARE MARSHES OF THIS DESCRIPTION
IN INDIA
THE WATER SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY INEXPLICABLE RIPPLING THOUGH
THERE IS NO WIND AND AGITATED WHERE IT SHOULD BE CALM
ONE GAZES AT THE
SURFACE OF THESE CAUSELESS EBULLITIONS ONE DOES NOT PERCEIVE THE HYDRA
WHICH CRAWLS ON THE BOTTOM
MANY MEN HAVE A SECRET MONSTER IN THIS SAME MANNER A DRAGON WHICH GNAWS
THEM A DESPAIR WHICH INHABITS THEIR NIGHT
SUCH A MAN RESEMBLES
OTHER MEN HE GOES AND COMES
NO ONE KNOWS THAT HE BEARS WITHIN HIM A
FRIGHTFUL PARASITIC PAIN WITH A THOUSAND TEETH WHICH LIVES WITHIN THE
UNHAPPY MAN AND OF WHICH HE IS DYING
NO ONE KNOWS THAT THIS MAN IS A
GULF
HE IS STAGNANT BUT DEEP
FROM TIME TO TIME A TROUBLE OF WHICH
THE ONLOOKER UNDERSTANDS NOTHING APPEARS ON HIS SURFACE
A MYSTERIOUS
WRINKLE IS FORMED THEN VANISHES THEN RE APPEARS AN AIR BUBBLE RISES
AND BURSTS
IT IS THE BREATHING OF THE UNKNOWN BEAST
CERTAIN STRANGE HABITS ARRIVING AT THE HOUR WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE
TAKING THEIR LEAVE KEEPING IN THE BACKGROUND WHEN OTHER PEOPLE
ARE DISPLAYING THEMSELVES PRESERVING ON ALL OCCASIONS WHAT MAY BE
DESIGNATED AS THE WALL COLORED MANTLE SEEKING THE SOLITARY WALK
PREFERRING THE DESERTED STREET AVOIDING ANY SHARE IN CONVERSATION
AVOIDING CROWDS AND FESTIVALS SEEMING AT ONE'S EASE AND LIVING POORLY
HAVING ONE'S KEY IN ONE'S POCKET AND ONE'S CANDLE AT THE PORTER'S
LODGE HOWEVER RICH ONE MAY BE ENTERING BY THE SIDE DOOR ASCENDING
THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE ALL THESE INSIGNIFICANT SINGULARITIES FUGITIVE
FOLDS ON THE SURFACE OFTEN PROCEED FROM A FORMIDABLE FOUNDATION
MANY WEEKS PASSED IN THIS MANNER
A NEW LIFE GRADUALLY TOOK POSSESSION
OF COSETTE THE RELATIONS WHICH MARRIAGE CREATES VISITS THE CARE
OF THE HOUSE PLEASURES GREAT MATTERS
COSETTE'S PLEASURES WERE NOT
COSTLY THEY CONSISTED IN ONE THING BEING WITH MARIUS
THE GREAT
OCCUPATION OF HER LIFE WAS TO GO OUT WITH HIM TO REMAIN WITH HIM
IT
WAS FOR THEM A JOY THAT WAS ALWAYS FRESH TO GO OUT ARM IN ARM IN THE
FACE OF THE SUN IN THE OPEN STREET WITHOUT HIDING THEMSELVES BEFORE
THE WHOLE WORLD BOTH OF THEM COMPLETELY ALONE
COSETTE HAD ONE VEXATION
TOUSSAINT COULD NOT GET ON WITH NICOLETTE THE
SOLDERING OF TWO ELDERLY MAIDS BEING IMPOSSIBLE AND SHE WENT AWAY
THE GRANDFATHER WAS WELL MARIUS ARGUED A CASE HERE AND THERE AUNT
GILLENORMAND PEACEFULLY LED THAT LIFE ASIDE WHICH SUFFICED FOR HER
BESIDE THE NEW HOUSEHOLD
JEAN VALJEAN CAME EVERY DAY
THE ADDRESS AS THOU DISAPPEARED THE YOU THE MADAME THE MONSIEUR
JEAN RENDERED HIM ANOTHER PERSON TO COSETTE
THE CARE WHICH HE HAD
HIMSELF TAKEN TO DETACH HER FROM HIM WAS SUCCEEDING
SHE BECAME MORE AND
MORE GAY AND LESS AND LESS TENDER
YET SHE STILL LOVED HIM SINCERELY
AND HE FELT IT
ONE DAY SHE SAID TO HIM SUDDENLY YOU USED TO BE MY FATHER YOU ARE
NO LONGER MY FATHER YOU WERE MY UNCLE YOU ARE NO LONGER MY UNCLE YOU
WERE MONSIEUR FAUCHELEVENT YOU ARE JEAN
WHO ARE YOU THEN I DON'T
LIKE ALL THIS
IF I DID NOT KNOW HOW GOOD YOU ARE I SHOULD BE AFRAID OF
YOU
HE STILL LIVED IN THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME BECAUSE HE COULD NOT MAKE UP
HIS MIND TO REMOVE TO A DISTANCE FROM THE QUARTER WHERE COSETTE DWELT
AT FIRST HE ONLY REMAINED A FEW MINUTES WITH COSETTE AND THEN WENT
AWAY
LITTLE BY LITTLE HE ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF MAKING HIS VISITS LESS BRIEF
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE AUTHORIZATION OF
THE DAYS WHICH WERE LENGTHENING HE ARRIVED EARLIER AND DEPARTED LATER
ONE DAY COSETTE CHANCED TO SAY FATHER TO HIM
A FLASH OF JOY
ILLUMINATED JEAN VALJEAN'S MELANCHOLY OLD COUNTENANCE
HE CAUGHT HER
UP SAY JEAN AH TRULY SHE REPLIED WITH A BURST OF LAUGHTER
MONSIEUR JEAN THAT IS RIGHT SAID HE
AND HE TURNED ASIDE SO THAT
SHE MIGHT NOT SEE HIM WIPE HIS EYES
CHAPTER III THEY RECALL THE GARDEN OF THE RUE PLUMET
THIS WAS THE LAST TIME
AFTER THAT LAST FLASH OF LIGHT COMPLETE
EXTINCTION ENSUED
NO MORE FAMILIARITY NO MORE GOOD MORNING WITH A
KISS NEVER MORE THAT WORD SO PROFOUNDLY SWEET MY FATHER HE WAS AT
HIS OWN REQUEST AND THROUGH HIS OWN COMPLICITY DRIVEN OUT OF ALL HIS
HAPPINESSES ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND HE HAD THIS SORROW THAT AFTER
HAVING LOST COSETTE WHOLLY IN ONE DAY HE WAS AFTERWARDS OBLIGED TO LOSE
HER AGAIN IN DETAIL
THE EYE EVENTUALLY BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT OF A CELLAR
IN
SHORT IT SUFFICED FOR HIM TO HAVE AN APPARITION OF COSETTE EVERY DAY
HIS WHOLE LIFE WAS CONCENTRATED IN THAT ONE HOUR
HE SEATED HIMSELF CLOSE TO HER HE GAZED AT HER IN SILENCE OR HE TALKED
TO HER OF YEARS GONE BY OF HER CHILDHOOD OF THE CONVENT OF HER LITTLE
FRIENDS OF THOSE BYGONE DAYS
ONE AFTERNOON IT WAS ON ONE OF THOSE EARLY DAYS IN APRIL ALREADY
WARM AND FRESH THE MOMENT OF THE SUN'S GREAT GAYETY THE GARDENS WHICH
SURROUNDED THE WINDOWS OF MARIUS AND COSETTE FELT THE EMOTION OF WAKING
THE HAWTHORN WAS ON THE POINT OF BUDDING A JEWELLED GARNITURE OF
GILLYFLOWERS SPREAD OVER THE ANCIENT WALLS SNAPDRAGONS YAWNED THROUGH
THE CREVICES OF THE STONES AMID THE GRASS THERE WAS A CHARMING
BEGINNING OF DAISIES AND BUTTERCUPS THE WHITE BUTTERFLIES OF THE
YEAR WERE MAKING THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE THE WIND THAT MINSTREL OF THE
ETERNAL WEDDING WAS TRYING IN THE TREES THE FIRST NOTES OF THAT GRAND
AURORAL SYMPHONY WHICH THE OLD POETS CALLED THE SPRINGTIDE MARIUS SAID
TO COSETTE WE SAID THAT WE WOULD GO BACK TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR GARDEN
IN THE RUE PLUMET
LET US GO THITHER
WE MUST NOT BE UNGRATEFUL AND
AWAY THEY FLITTED LIKE TWO SWALLOWS TOWARDS THE SPRING
THIS GARDEN OF
THE RUE PLUMET PRODUCED ON THEM THE EFFECT OF THE DAWN
THEY ALREADY
HAD BEHIND THEM IN LIFE SOMETHING WHICH WAS LIKE THE SPRINGTIME OF THEIR
LOVE
THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET BEING HELD ON A LEASE STILL BELONGED
TO COSETTE
THEY WENT TO THAT GARDEN AND THAT HOUSE
THERE THEY
FOUND THEMSELVES AGAIN THERE THEY FORGOT THEMSELVES
THAT
EVENING AT THE USUAL HOUR JEAN VALJEAN CAME TO THE RUE DES
FILLES DU CALVAIRE MADAME WENT OUT WITH MONSIEUR AND HAS NOT YET
RETURNED BASQUE SAID TO HIM
HE SEATED HIMSELF IN SILENCE AND WAITED
AN HOUR
COSETTE DID NOT RETURN
HE DEPARTED WITH DROOPING HEAD
COSETTE WAS SO INTOXICATED WITH HER WALK TO THEIR GARDEN AND SO
JOYOUS AT HAVING LIVED A WHOLE DAY IN HER PAST THAT SHE TALKED OF
NOTHING ELSE ON THE MORROW
SHE DID NOT NOTICE THAT SHE HAD NOT SEEN
JEAN VALJEAN
IN WHAT WAY DID YOU GO THITHER JEAN VALJEAN ASKED HER
ON FOOT
AND HOW DID YOU RETURN
IN A HACKNEY CARRIAGE
FOR SOME TIME JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOTICED THE ECONOMICAL LIFE LED BY THE
YOUNG PEOPLE
HE WAS TROUBLED BY IT
MARIUS' ECONOMY WAS SEVERE AND
THAT WORD HAD ITS ABSOLUTE MEANING FOR JEAN VALJEAN
HE HAZARDED A
QUERY
WHY DO YOU NOT HAVE A CARRIAGE OF YOUR OWN A PRETTY COUPE WOULD ONLY
COST YOU FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS A MONTH
YOU ARE RICH
I DON'T KNOW REPLIED COSETTE
IT IS LIKE TOUSSAINT RESUMED JEAN VALJEAN
SHE IS GONE
YOU HAVE NOT
REPLACED HER
WHY
NICOLETTE SUFFICES
BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A MAID
HAVE I NOT MARIUS
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A HOUSE OF YOUR OWN YOUR OWN SERVANTS A CARRIAGE A
BOX AT THE THEATRE
THERE IS NOTHING TOO FINE FOR YOU
WHY NOT PROFIT BY
YOUR RICHES WEALTH ADDS TO HAPPINESS
COSETTE MADE NO REPLY
JEAN VALJEAN'S VISITS WERE NOT ABRIDGED
FAR FROM IT
WHEN IT IS THE
HEART WHICH IS SLIPPING ONE DOES NOT HALT ON THE DOWNWARD SLOPE
WHEN JEAN VALJEAN WISHED TO PROLONG HIS VISIT AND TO INDUCE
FORGETFULNESS OF THE HOUR HE SANG THE PRAISES OF MARIUS HE PRONOUNCED
HIM HANDSOME NOBLE COURAGEOUS WITTY ELOQUENT GOOD
COSETTE OUTDID
HIM
JEAN VALJEAN BEGAN AGAIN
THEY WERE NEVER WEARY
MARIUS THAT WORD
WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE THOSE SIX LETTERS CONTAINED VOLUMES
IN THIS MANNER
JEAN VALJEAN CONTRIVED TO REMAIN A LONG TIME
IT WAS SO SWEET TO SEE COSETTE TO FORGET BY HER SIDE IT ALLEVIATED HIS
WOUNDS
IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENED THAT BASQUE CAME TWICE TO ANNOUNCE
M
GILLENORMAND SENDS ME TO REMIND MADAME LA BARONNE THAT DINNER IS
SERVED
ON THOSE DAYS JEAN VALJEAN WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL ON HIS RETURN HOME
WAS THERE THEN ANY TRUTH IN THAT COMPARISON OF THE CHRYSALIS WHICH
HAD PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE MIND OF MARIUS WAS JEAN VALJEAN REALLY A
CHRYSALIS WHO WOULD PERSIST AND WHO WOULD COME TO VISIT HIS BUTTERFLY
ONE DAY HE REMAINED STILL LONGER THAN USUAL
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE
OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS NO FIRE ON THE HEARTH HELLO HE THOUGHT
NO
FIRE AND HE FURNISHED THE EXPLANATION FOR HIMSELF IT IS PERFECTLY
SIMPLE
IT IS APRIL
THE COLD WEATHER HAS CEASED
HEAVENS HOW COLD IT IS HERE EXCLAIMED COSETTE WHEN SHE ENTERED
WHY NO SAID JEAN VALJEAN
WAS IT YOU WHO TOLD BASQUE NOT TO MAKE A FIRE THEN
YES SINCE WE ARE NOW IN THE MONTH OF MAY
BUT WE HAVE A FIRE UNTIL JUNE
ONE IS NEEDED ALL THE YEAR IN THIS
CELLAR
I THOUGHT THAT A FIRE WAS UNNECESSARY
THAT IS EXACTLY LIKE ONE OF YOUR IDEAS RETORTED COSETTE
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THERE WAS A FIRE
BUT THE TWO ARM CHAIRS WERE
ARRANGED AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM NEAR THE DOOR
WHAT IS THE
MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN
HE WENT FOR THE ARM CHAIRS AND RESTORED THEM TO THEIR ORDINARY PLACE
NEAR THE HEARTH
THIS FIRE LIGHTED ONCE MORE ENCOURAGED HIM HOWEVER
HE PROLONGED THE
CONVERSATION EVEN BEYOND ITS CUSTOMARY LIMITS
AS HE ROSE TO TAKE HIS
LEAVE COSETTE SAID TO HIM
MY HUSBAND SAID A QUEER THING TO ME YESTERDAY
WHAT WAS IT
HE SAID TO ME 'COSETTE WE HAVE AN INCOME OF THIRTY THOUSAND LIVRES
TWENTY SEVEN THAT YOU OWN AND THREE THAT MY GRANDFATHER GIVES ME I
REPLIED 'THAT MAKES THIRTY HE WENT ON 'WOULD YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO
LIVE ON THE THREE THOUSAND I ANSWERED 'YES ON NOTHING
PROVIDED
THAT IT WAS WITH YOU AND THEN I ASKED 'WHY DO YOU SAY THAT TO ME HE
REPLIED 'I WANTED TO KNOW
JEAN VALJEAN FOUND NOT A WORD TO ANSWER
COSETTE PROBABLY EXPECTED SOME
EXPLANATION FROM HIM HE LISTENED IN GLOOMY SILENCE
HE WENT BACK TO THE
RUE DE L'HOMME ARME HE WAS SO DEEPLY ABSORBED THAT HE MISTOOK THE
DOOR AND INSTEAD OF ENTERING HIS OWN HOUSE HE ENTERED THE ADJOINING
DWELLING
IT WAS ONLY AFTER HAVING ASCENDED NEARLY TWO STORIES THAT HE
PERCEIVED HIS ERROR AND WENT DOWN AGAIN
HIS MIND WAS SWARMING WITH CONJECTURES
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MARIUS HAD
HIS DOUBTS AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THAT
HE FEARED SOME SOURCE THAT WAS NOT PURE WHO KNOWS THAT HE HAD EVEN
PERHAPS DISCOVERED THAT THE MONEY CAME FROM HIM JEAN VALJEAN THAT HE
HESITATED BEFORE THIS SUSPICIOUS FORTUNE AND WAS DISINCLINED TO TAKE
IT AS HIS OWN PREFERRING THAT BOTH HE AND COSETTE SHOULD REMAIN POOR
RATHER THAN THAT THEY SHOULD BE RICH WITH WEALTH THAT WAS NOT CLEAN
MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN BEGAN VAGUELY TO SURMISE THAT HE WAS BEING SHOWN
THE DOOR
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE UNDERWENT SOMETHING LIKE A SHOCK ON ENTERING
THE GROUND FLOOR ROOM
THE ARM CHAIRS HAD DISAPPEARED
THERE WAS NOT A
SINGLE CHAIR OF ANY SORT
AH WHAT'S THIS EXCLAIMED COSETTE AS SHE ENTERED NO CHAIRS WHERE
ARE THE ARM CHAIRS
THEY ARE NO LONGER HERE REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN
THIS IS TOO MUCH
JEAN VALJEAN STAMMERED
IT WAS I WHO TOLD BASQUE TO REMOVE THEM
AND YOUR REASON
I HAVE ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO STAY TO DAY
A BRIEF STAY IS NO REASON FOR REMAINING STANDING
I THINK THAT BASQUE NEEDED THE CHAIRS FOR THE DRAWING ROOM
WHY
YOU HAVE COMPANY THIS EVENING NO DOUBT
WE EXPECT NO ONE
JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT ANOTHER WORD TO SAY
COSETTE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
TO HAVE THE CHAIRS CARRIED OFF THE OTHER DAY YOU HAD THE FIRE PUT OUT
HOW ODD YOU ARE
ADIEU MURMURED JEAN VALJEAN
HE DID NOT SAY ADIEU COSETTE BUT HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO SAY
ADIEU MADAME
HE WENT AWAY UTTERLY OVERWHELMED
THIS TIME HE HAD UNDERSTOOD
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE DID NOT COME
COSETTE ONLY OBSERVED THE FACT IN
THE EVENING
WHY SAID SHE MONSIEUR JEAN HAS NOT BEEN HERE TODAY
AND SHE FELT A SLIGHT TWINGE AT HER HEART BUT SHE HARDLY PERCEIVED IT
BEING IMMEDIATELY DIVERTED BY A KISS FROM MARIUS
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE DID NOT COME
COSETTE PAID NO HEED TO THIS PASSED HER EVENING AND SLEPT WELL THAT
NIGHT AS USUAL AND THOUGHT OF IT ONLY WHEN SHE WOKE
SHE WAS SO HAPPY
SHE SPEEDILY DESPATCHED NICOLETTE TO M
JEAN'S HOUSE TO INQUIRE WHETHER
HE WERE ILL AND WHY HE HAD NOT COME ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
NICOLETTE
BROUGHT BACK THE REPLY OF M
JEAN THAT HE WAS NOT ILL
HE WAS BUSY
HE
WOULD COME SOON
AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
MOREOVER HE WAS ON THE POINT
OF TAKING A LITTLE JOURNEY
MADAME MUST REMEMBER THAT IT WAS HIS CUSTOM
TO TAKE TRIPS FROM TIME TO TIME
THEY WERE NOT TO WORRY ABOUT HIM
THEY
WERE NOT TO THINK OF HIM
NICOLETTE ON ENTERING M
JEAN'S HAD REPEATED TO HIM HER MISTRESS' VERY
WORDS
THAT MADAME HAD SENT HER TO INQUIRE WHY M
JEAN BAD NOT COME ON
THE PRECEDING EVENING IT IS TWO DAYS SINCE I HAVE BEEN THERE SAID
JEAN VALJEAN GENTLY
BUT THE REMARK PASSED UNNOTICED BY NICOLETTE WHO DID NOT REPORT IT TO
COSETTE
CHAPTER IV ATTRACTION AND EXTINCTION
DURING THE LAST MONTHS OF SPRING AND THE FIRST MONTHS OF SUMMER IN 1833
THE RARE PASSERSBY IN THE MARAIS THE PETTY SHOPKEEPERS THE LOUNGERS ON
THRESHOLDS NOTICED AN OLD MAN NEATLY CLAD IN BLACK WHO EMERGED EVERY
DAY AT THE SAME HOUR TOWARDS NIGHTFALL FROM THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME
ON THE SIDE OF THE RUE SAINTE CROIX DE LA BRETONNERIE PASSED IN FRONT
OF THE BLANCS MANTEAUX GAINED THE RUE CULTURE SAINTE CATHERINE AND
ON ARRIVING AT THE RUE DE L'ECHARPE TURNED TO THE LEFT AND ENTERED THE
RUE SAINT LOUIS
THERE HE WALKED AT A SLOW PACE WITH HIS HEAD STRAINED FORWARD SEEING
NOTHING HEARING NOTHING HIS EYE IMMOVABLY FIXED ON A POINT WHICH
SEEMED TO BE A STAR TO HIM WHICH NEVER VARIED AND WHICH WAS NO
OTHER THAN THE CORNER OF THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE
THE NEARER HE
APPROACHED THE CORNER OF THE STREET THE MORE HIS EYE LIGHTED UP A SORT
OF JOY ILLUMINATED HIS PUPILS LIKE AN INWARD AURORA HE HAD A FASCINATED
AND MUCH AFFECTED AIR HIS LIPS INDULGED IN OBSCURE MOVEMENTS AS THOUGH
HE WERE TALKING TO SOME ONE WHOM HE DID NOT SEE HE SMILED VAGUELY AND
ADVANCED AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT WHILE DESIROUS
OF REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE FEARED THE MOMENT WHEN HE SHOULD BE
CLOSE AT HAND
WHEN ONLY A FEW HOUSES REMAINED BETWEEN HIM AND THAT
STREET WHICH APPEARED TO ATTRACT HIM HIS PACE SLACKENED TO SUCH A
DEGREE THAT AT TIMES ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS NO LONGER
ADVANCING AT ALL
THE VACILLATION OF HIS HEAD AND THE FIXITY OF HIS
EYEBALLS SUGGESTED THE THOUGHT OF THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE SEEKING THE POLE
WHATEVER TIME HE SPENT ON ARRIVING HE WAS OBLIGED TO ARRIVE AT LAST HE
REACHED THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE THEN HE HALTED HE TREMBLED HE
THRUST HIS HEAD WITH A SORT OF MELANCHOLY TIMIDITY ROUND THE CORNER OF
THE LAST HOUSE AND GAZED INTO THAT STREET AND THERE WAS IN THAT TRAGIC
LOOK SOMETHING WHICH RESEMBLED THE DAZZLING LIGHT OF THE IMPOSSIBLE
AND THE REFLECTION FROM A PARADISE THAT WAS CLOSED TO HIM
THEN A TEAR
WHICH HAD SLOWLY GATHERED IN THE CORNER OF HIS LIDS AND HAD BECOME
LARGE ENOUGH TO FALL TRICKLED DOWN HIS CHEEK AND SOMETIMES STOPPED AT
HIS MOUTH
THE OLD MAN TASTED ITS BITTER FLAVOR
THUS HE REMAINED FOR
SEVERAL MINUTES AS THOUGH MADE OF STONE THEN HE RETURNED BY THE SAME
ROAD AND WITH THE SAME STEP AND IN PROPORTION AS HE RETREATED HIS
GLANCE DIED OUT
LITTLE BY LITTLE THIS OLD MAN CEASED TO GO AS FAR AS THE CORNER OF THE
RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE HE HALTED HALF WAY IN THE RUE SAINT LOUIS
SOMETIMES A LITTLE FURTHER OFF SOMETIMES A LITTLE NEARER
ONE DAY HE STOPPED AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE CULTURE SAINTE CATHERINE AND
LOOKED AT THE RUE DES FILLES DU CALVAIRE FROM A DISTANCE
THEN HE
SHOOK HIS HEAD SLOWLY FROM RIGHT TO LEFT AS THOUGH REFUSING HIMSELF
SOMETHING AND RETRACED HIS STEPS
SOON HE NO LONGER CAME AS FAR AS THE RUE SAINT LOUIS
HE GOT AS FAR AS
THE RUE PAVEE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND TURNED BACK THEN HE WENT NO
FURTHER THAN THE RUE DES TROIS PAVILLONS THEN HE DID NOT OVERSTEP THE
BLANCS MANTEAUX
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS A PENDULUM WHICH WAS
NO LONGER WOUND UP AND WHOSE OSCILLATIONS WERE GROWING SHORTER BEFORE
CEASING ALTOGETHER
EVERY DAY HE EMERGED FROM HIS HOUSE AT THE SAME HOUR HE UNDERTOOK THE
SAME TRIP BUT HE NO LONGER COMPLETED IT AND PERHAPS WITHOUT
HIMSELF BEING AWARE OF THE FACT HE CONSTANTLY SHORTENED IT
HIS WHOLE
COUNTENANCE EXPRESSED THIS SINGLE IDEA WHAT IS THE USE HIS EYE WAS
DIM NO MORE RADIANCE
HIS TEARS WERE ALSO EXHAUSTED THEY NO LONGER
COLLECTED IN THE CORNER OF HIS EYE LID THAT THOUGHTFUL EYE WAS DRY
THE
OLD MAN'S HEAD WAS STILL CRANED FORWARD HIS CHIN MOVED AT TIMES THE
FOLDS IN HIS GAUNT NECK WERE PAINFUL TO BEHOLD
SOMETIMES WHEN THE
WEATHER WAS BAD HE HAD AN UMBRELLA UNDER HIS ARM BUT HE NEVER OPENED
IT
THE GOOD WOMEN OF THE QUARTER SAID HE IS AN INNOCENT THE CHILDREN
FOLLOWED HIM AND LAUGHED
BOOK NINTH SUPREME SHADOW SUPREME DAWN
CHAPTER I PITY FOR THE UNHAPPY BUT INDULGENCE FOR THE HAPPY
IT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO BE HAPPY HOW CONTENT ONE IS HOW
ALL SUFFICIENT ONE FINDS IT HOW BEING IN POSSESSION OF THE FALSE
OBJECT OF LIFE HAPPINESS ONE FORGETS THE TRUE OBJECT DUTY
LET US SAY HOWEVER THAT THE READER WOULD DO WRONG WERE HE TO BLAME
MARIUS
MARIUS AS WE HAVE EXPLAINED BEFORE HIS MARRIAGE HAD PUT NO QUESTIONS
TO M
FAUCHELEVENT AND SINCE THAT TIME HE HAD FEARED TO PUT ANY TO
JEAN VALJEAN
HE HAD REGRETTED THE PROMISE INTO WHICH HE HAD ALLOWED
HIMSELF TO BE DRAWN
HE HAD OFTEN SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD DONE
WRONG IN MAKING THAT CONCESSION TO DESPAIR
HE HAD CONFINED HIMSELF TO
GRADUALLY ESTRANGING JEAN VALJEAN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO EFFACING HIM
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM COSETTE'S MIND
HE HAD IN A MANNER ALWAYS
PLACED HIMSELF BETWEEN COSETTE AND JEAN VALJEAN SURE THAT IN THIS
WAY SHE WOULD NOT PERCEIVE NOR THINK OF THE LATTER
IT WAS MORE THAN
EFFACEMENT IT WAS AN ECLIPSE
MARIUS DID WHAT HE CONSIDERED NECESSARY AND JUST
HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD
SERIOUS REASONS WHICH THE READER HAS ALREADY SEEN AND OTHERS WHICH WILL
BE SEEN LATER ON FOR GETTING RID OF JEAN VALJEAN WITHOUT HARSHNESS BUT
WITHOUT WEAKNESS
CHANCE HAVING ORDAINED THAT HE SHOULD ENCOUNTER IN A CASE WHICH HE HAD
ARGUED A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE LAFFITTE ESTABLISHMENT HE HAD ACQUIRED
MYSTERIOUS INFORMATION WITHOUT SEEKING IT WHICH HE HAD NOT BEEN
ABLE IT IS TRUE TO PROBE OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE SECRET WHICH HE HAD
PROMISED TO GUARD AND OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR JEAN VALJEAN'S PERILOUS
POSITION
HE BELIEVED AT THAT MOMENT THAT HE HAD A GRAVE DUTY TO
PERFORM THE RESTITUTION OF THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS TO SOME
ONE WHOM HE SOUGHT WITH ALL POSSIBLE DISCRETION
IN THE MEANWHILE HE
ABSTAINED FROM TOUCHING THAT MONEY
AS FOR COSETTE SHE HAD NOT BEEN INITIATED INTO ANY OF THESE SECRETS
BUT IT WOULD BE HARSH TO CONDEMN HER ALSO
THERE EXISTED BETWEEN MARIUS AND HER AN ALL POWERFUL MAGNETISM WHICH
CAUSED HER TO DO INSTINCTIVELY AND ALMOST MECHANICALLY WHAT MARIUS
WISHED
SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF MARIUS' WILL IN THE DIRECTION OF MONSIEUR
JEAN SHE CONFORMED TO IT
HER HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN OBLIGED TO SAY
ANYTHING TO HER SHE YIELDED TO THE VAGUE BUT CLEAR PRESSURE OF HIS
TACIT INTENTIONS AND OBEYED BLINDLY
HER OBEDIENCE IN THIS INSTANCE
CONSISTED IN NOT REMEMBERING WHAT MARIUS FORGOT
SHE WAS NOT OBLIGED TO
MAKE ANY EFFORT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS
WITHOUT HER KNOWING WHY HERSELF AND
WITHOUT HIS HAVING ANY CAUSE TO ACCUSE HER OF IT HER SOUL HAD BECOME
SO WHOLLY HER HUSBAND'S THAT THAT WHICH WAS SHROUDED IN GLOOM IN MARIUS'
MIND BECAME OVERCAST IN HERS
LET US NOT GO TOO FAR HOWEVER IN WHAT CONCERNS JEAN VALJEAN THIS
FORGETFULNESS AND OBLITERATION WERE MERELY SUPERFICIAL
SHE WAS RATHER
HEEDLESS THAN FORGETFUL
AT BOTTOM SHE WAS SINCERELY ATTACHED TO THE
MAN WHOM SHE HAD SO LONG CALLED HER FATHER BUT SHE LOVED HER HUSBAND
STILL MORE DEARLY
THIS WAS WHAT HAD SOMEWHAT DISTURBED THE BALANCE OF
HER HEART WHICH LEANED TO ONE SIDE ONLY
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT COSETTE SPOKE OF JEAN VALJEAN AND EXPRESSED
HER SURPRISE
THEN MARIUS CALMED HER HE IS ABSENT I THINK
DID NOT
HE SAY THAT HE WAS SETTING OUT ON A JOURNEY THAT IS TRUE THOUGHT
COSETTE
HE HAD A HABIT OF DISAPPEARING IN THIS FASHION
BUT NOT FOR SO
LONG TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE DESPATCHED NICOLETTE TO INQUIRE IN THE
RUE DE L'HOMME ARME WHETHER M
JEAN HAD RETURNED FROM HIS JOURNEY
JEAN
VALJEAN CAUSED THE ANSWER NO TO BE GIVEN
COSETTE ASKED NOTHING MORE SINCE SHE HAD BUT ONE NEED ON EARTH MARIUS
LET US ALSO SAY THAT ON THEIR SIDE COSETTE AND MARIUS HAD ALSO
BEEN ABSENT
THEY HAD BEEN TO VERNON
MARIUS HAD TAKEN COSETTE TO HIS
FATHER'S GRAVE
MARIUS GRADUALLY WON COSETTE AWAY FROM JEAN VALJEAN
COSETTE ALLOWED IT
MOREOVER THAT WHICH IS CALLED FAR TOO HARSHLY IN CERTAIN CASES THE
INGRATITUDE OF CHILDREN IS NOT ALWAYS A THING SO DESERVING OF REPROACH
AS IT IS SUPPOSED
IT IS THE INGRATITUDE OF NATURE
NATURE AS WE HAVE
ELSEWHERE SAID LOOKS BEFORE HER NATURE DIVIDES LIVING BEINGS INTO
THOSE WHO ARE ARRIVING AND THOSE WHO ARE DEPARTING
THOSE WHO ARE
DEPARTING ARE TURNED TOWARDS THE SHADOWS THOSE WHO ARE ARRIVING TOWARDS
THE LIGHT
HENCE A GULF WHICH IS FATAL ON THE PART OF THE OLD AND
INVOLUNTARY ON THE PART OF THE YOUNG
THIS BREACH AT FIRST INSENSIBLE
INCREASES SLOWLY LIKE ALL SEPARATIONS OF BRANCHES
THE BOUGHS WITHOUT
BECOMING DETACHED FROM THE TRUNK GROW AWAY FROM IT
IT IS NO FAULT OF
THEIRS
YOUTH GOES WHERE THERE IS JOY FESTIVALS VIVID LIGHTS LOVE
OLD AGE GOES TOWARDS THE END
THEY DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF EACH OTHER BUT
THERE IS NO LONGER A CLOSE CONNECTION
YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL THE COOLING
OFF OF LIFE OLD PEOPLE THAT OF THE TOMB
LET US NOT BLAME THESE POOR
CHILDREN
CHAPTER II LAST FLICKERINGS OF A LAMP WITHOUT OIL
ONE DAY JEAN VALJEAN DESCENDED HIS STAIRCASE TOOK THREE STEPS IN THE
STREET SEATED HIMSELF ON A POST ON THAT SAME STONE POST WHERE GAVROCHE
HAD FOUND HIM MEDITATING ON THE NIGHT BETWEEN THE 5TH AND THE 6TH OF
JUNE HE REMAINED THERE A FEW MOMENTS THEN WENT UP STAIRS AGAIN
THIS
WAS THE LAST OSCILLATION OF THE PENDULUM
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE DID
NOT LEAVE HIS APARTMENT
ON THE DAY AFTER THAT HE DID NOT LEAVE HIS
BED
HIS PORTRESS WHO PREPARED HIS SCANTY REPASTS A FEW CABBAGES OR
POTATOES WITH BACON GLANCED AT THE BROWN EARTHENWARE PLATE AND
EXCLAIMED
BUT YOU ATE NOTHING YESTERDAY POOR DEAR MAN
CERTAINLY I DID REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN
THE PLATE IS QUITE FULL
LOOK AT THE WATER JUG
IT IS EMPTY
THAT PROVES THAT YOU HAVE DRUNK IT DOES NOT PROVE THAT YOU HAVE
EATEN
WELL SAID JEAN VALJEAN WHAT IF I FELT HUNGRY ONLY FOR WATER
THAT IS CALLED THIRST AND WHEN ONE DOES NOT EAT AT THE SAME TIME IT
IS CALLED FEVER
I WILL EAT TO MORROW
OR AT TRINITY DAY
WHY NOT TO DAY IS IT THE THING TO SAY 'I WILL EAT
TO MORROW' THE IDEA OF LEAVING MY PLATTER WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING IT MY
LADYFINGER POTATOES WERE SO GOOD
JEAN VALJEAN TOOK THE OLD WOMAN'S HAND
I PROMISE YOU THAT I WILL EAT THEM HE SAID IN HIS BENEVOLENT VOICE
I AM NOT PLEASED WITH YOU REPLIED THE PORTRESS
JEAN VALJEAN SAW NO OTHER HUMAN CREATURE THAN THIS GOOD WOMAN
THERE ARE
STREETS IN PARIS THROUGH WHICH NO ONE EVER PASSES AND HOUSES TO WHICH
NO ONE EVER COMES
HE WAS IN ONE OF THOSE STREETS AND ONE OF THOSE
HOUSES
WHILE HE STILL WENT OUT HE HAD PURCHASED OF A COPPERSMITH FOR A FEW
SOUS A LITTLE COPPER CRUCIFIX WHICH HE HAD HUNG UP ON A NAIL OPPOSITE
HIS BED
THAT GIBBET IS ALWAYS GOOD TO LOOK AT
A WEEK PASSED AND JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT TAKEN A STEP IN HIS ROOM
HE
STILL REMAINED IN BED
THE PORTRESS SAID TO HER HUSBAND THE GOOD MAN
UPSTAIRS YONDER DOES NOT GET UP HE NO LONGER EATS HE WILL NOT LAST
LONG
THAT MAN HAS HIS SORROWS THAT HE HAS
YOU WON'T GET IT OUT OF MY
HEAD THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAS MADE A BAD MARRIAGE
THE PORTER REPLIED WITH THE TONE OF MARITAL SOVEREIGNTY
IF HE'S RICH LET HIM HAVE A DOCTOR
IF HE IS NOT RICH LET HIM GO
WITHOUT
IF HE HAS NO DOCTOR HE WILL DIE
AND IF HE HAS ONE
HE WILL DIE SAID THE PORTER
THE PORTRESS SET TO SCRAPING AWAY THE GRASS FROM WHAT SHE CALLED HER
PAVEMENT WITH AN OLD KNIFE AND AS SHE TORE OUT THE BLADES SHE
GRUMBLED
IT'S A SHAME
SUCH A NEAT OLD MAN HE'S AS WHITE AS A CHICKEN
SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE DOCTOR OF THE QUARTER AS HE PASSED THE END OF
THE STREET SHE TOOK IT UPON HERSELF TO REQUEST HIM TO COME UP STAIRS
IT'S ON THE SECOND FLOOR SAID SHE
YOU HAVE ONLY TO ENTER
AS THE
GOOD MAN NO LONGER STIRS FROM HIS BED THE DOOR IS ALWAYS UNLOCKED
THE DOCTOR SAW JEAN VALJEAN AND SPOKE WITH HIM
WHEN HE CAME DOWN AGAIN THE PORTRESS INTERROGATED HIM
WELL DOCTOR
YOUR SICK MAN IS VERY ILL INDEED
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HIM
EVERYTHING AND NOTHING
HE IS A MAN WHO TO ALL APPEARANCES HAS LOST
SOME PERSON WHO IS DEAR TO HIM
PEOPLE DIE OF THAT
WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU
HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH
SHALL YOU COME AGAIN DOCTOR
YES REPLIED THE DOCTOR
BUT SOME ONE ELSE BESIDES MUST COME
CHAPTER III A PEN IS HEAVY TO THE MAN WHO LIFTED THE FAUCHELEVENT'S
CART
ONE EVENING JEAN VALJEAN FOUND DIFFICULTY IN RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS
ELBOW HE FELT OF HIS WRIST AND COULD NOT FIND HIS PULSE HIS BREATH
WAS SHORT AND HALTED AT TIMES HE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT HE WAS WEAKER
THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
THEN NO DOUBT UNDER THE PRESSURE OF SOME
SUPREME PREOCCUPATION HE MADE AN EFFORT DREW HIMSELF UP INTO A SITTING
POSTURE AND DRESSED HIMSELF
HE PUT ON HIS OLD WORKINGMAN'S CLOTHES
AS
HE NO LONGER WENT OUT HE HAD RETURNED TO THEM AND PREFERRED THEM
HE
WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE MANY TIMES WHILE DRESSING HIMSELF MERELY PUTTING
HIS ARMS THROUGH HIS WAISTCOAT MADE THE PERSPIRATION TRICKLE FROM HIS
FOREHEAD
SINCE HE HAD BEEN ALONE HE HAD PLACED HIS BED IN THE ANTECHAMBER IN
ORDER TO INHABIT THAT DESERTED APARTMENT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
HE OPENED THE VALISE AND DREW FROM IT COSETTE'S OUTFIT
HE SPREAD IT OUT ON HIS BED
THE BISHOP'S CANDLESTICKS WERE IN THEIR PLACE ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
HE
TOOK FROM A DRAWER TWO WAX CANDLES AND PUT THEM IN THE CANDLESTICKS
THEN ALTHOUGH IT WAS STILL BROAD DAYLIGHT IT WAS SUMMER HE LIGHTED
THEM
IN THE SAME WAY CANDLES ARE TO BE SEEN LIGHTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
IN CHAMBERS WHERE THERE IS A CORPSE
EVERY STEP THAT HE TOOK IN GOING FROM ONE PIECE OF FURNITURE TO ANOTHER
EXHAUSTED HIM AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN
IT WAS NOT ORDINARY
FATIGUE WHICH EXPENDS THE STRENGTH ONLY TO RENEW IT IT WAS THE REMNANT
OF ALL MOVEMENT POSSIBLE TO HIM IT WAS LIFE DRAINED WHICH FLOWS AWAY
DROP BY DROP IN OVERWHELMING EFFORTS AND WHICH WILL NEVER BE RENEWED
THE CHAIR INTO WHICH HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO FALL WAS PLACED IN FRONT OF
THAT MIRROR SO FATAL FOR HIM SO PROVIDENTIAL FOR MARIUS IN WHICH
HE HAD READ COSETTE'S REVERSED WRITING ON THE BLOTTING BOOK
HE CAUGHT
SIGHT OF HIMSELF IN THIS MIRROR AND DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIMSELF
HE WAS
EIGHTY YEARS OLD BEFORE MARIUS' MARRIAGE HE WOULD HAVE HARDLY BEEN
TAKEN FOR FIFTY THAT YEAR HAD COUNTED FOR THIRTY
WHAT HE BORE ON HIS
BROW WAS NO LONGER THE WRINKLES OF AGE IT WAS THE MYSTERIOUS MARK OF
DEATH
THE HOLLOWING OF THAT PITILESS NAIL COULD BE FELT THERE
HIS
CHEEKS WERE PENDULOUS THE SKIN OF HIS FACE HAD THE COLOR WHICH WOULD
LEAD ONE TO THINK THAT IT ALREADY HAD EARTH UPON IT THE CORNERS OF HIS
MOUTH DROOPED AS IN THE MASK WHICH THE ANCIENTS SCULPTURED ON TOMBS
HE
GAZED INTO SPACE WITH AN AIR OF REPROACH ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE
WAS ONE OF THOSE GRAND TRAGIC BEINGS WHO HAVE CAUSE TO COMPLAIN OF SOME
ONE
HE WAS IN THAT CONDITION THE LAST PHASE OF DEJECTION IN WHICH SORROW
NO LONGER FLOWS IT IS COAGULATED SO TO SPEAK THERE IS SOMETHING ON
THE SOUL LIKE A CLOT OF DESPAIR
NIGHT HAD COME
HE LABORIOUSLY DRAGGED A TABLE AND THE OLD ARM CHAIR TO
THE FIRESIDE AND PLACED UPON THE TABLE A PEN SOME INK AND SOME PAPER
THAT DONE HE HAD A FAINTING FIT
WHEN HE RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS HE
WAS THIRSTY
AS HE COULD NOT LIFT THE JUG HE TIPPED IT OVER PAINFULLY
TOWARDS HIS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED A DRAUGHT
AS NEITHER THE PEN NOR THE INK HAD BEEN USED FOR A LONG TIME THE POINT
OF THE PEN HAD CURLED UP THE INK HAD DRIED AWAY HE WAS FORCED TO RISE
AND PUT A FEW DROPS OF WATER IN THE INK WHICH HE DID NOT ACCOMPLISH
WITHOUT PAUSING AND SITTING DOWN TWO OR THREE TIMES AND HE WAS
COMPELLED TO WRITE WITH THE BACK OF THE PEN
HE WIPED HIS BROW FROM TIME
TO TIME
THEN HE TURNED TOWARDS THE BED AND STILL SEATED FOR HE COULD NOT
STAND HE GAZED AT THE LITTLE BLACK GOWN AND ALL THOSE BELOVED OBJECTS
THESE CONTEMPLATIONS LASTED FOR HOURS WHICH SEEMED MINUTES
ALL AT ONCE HE SHIVERED HE FELT THAT A CHILD WAS TAKING POSSESSION OF
HIM HE RESTED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE WHICH WAS ILLUMINATED BY THE
BISHOP'S CANDLES AND TOOK UP THE PEN
HIS HAND TREMBLED
HE WROTE SLOWLY
THE FEW FOLLOWING LINES
COSETTE I BLESS THEE
I AM GOING TO EXPLAIN TO THEE
THY HUSBAND WAS
RIGHT IN GIVING ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT I OUGHT TO GO AWAY BUT THERE IS
A LITTLE ERROR IN WHAT HE BELIEVED THOUGH HE WAS IN THE RIGHT
HE IS
EXCELLENT
LOVE HIM WELL EVEN AFTER I AM DEAD
MONSIEUR PONTMERCY LOVE
MY DARLING CHILD WELL
COSETTE THIS PAPER WILL BE FOUND THIS IS WHAT
I WISH TO SAY TO THEE THOU WILT SEE THE FIGURES IF I HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO RECALL THEM LISTEN WELL THIS MONEY IS REALLY THINE
HERE IS THE
WHOLE MATTER WHITE JET COMES FROM NORWAY BLACK JET COMES FROM ENGLAND
BLACK GLASS JEWELLERY COMES FROM GERMANY
JET IS THE LIGHTEST THE MOST
PRECIOUS THE MOST COSTLY
IMITATIONS CAN BE MADE IN FRANCE AS WELL AS
IN GERMANY
WHAT IS NEEDED IS A LITTLE ANVIL TWO INCHES SQUARE AND A
LAMP BURNING SPIRITS OF WINE TO SOFTEN THE WAX
THE WAX WAS FORMERLY
MADE WITH RESIN AND LAMPBLACK AND COST FOUR LIVRES THE POUND
I
INVENTED A WAY OF MAKING IT WITH GUM SHELLAC AND TURPENTINE
IT DOES NOT
COST MORE THAN THIRTY SOUS AND IS MUCH BETTER
BUCKLES ARE MADE WITH
A VIOLET GLASS WHICH IS STUCK FAST BY MEANS OF THIS WAX TO A LITTLE
FRAMEWORK OF BLACK IRON
THE GLASS MUST BE VIOLET FOR IRON JEWELLERY
AND BLACK FOR GOLD JEWELLERY
SPAIN BUYS A GREAT DEAL OF IT
IT IS THE
COUNTRY OF JET
HERE HE PAUSED THE PEN FELL FROM HIS FINGERS HE WAS SEIZED BY ONE OF
THOSE SOBS WHICH AT TIMES WELLED UP FROM THE VERY DEPTHS OF HIS BEING
THE POOR MAN CLASPED HIS HEAD IN BOTH HANDS AND MEDITATED
OH HE EXCLAIMED WITHIN HIMSELF LAMENTABLE CRIES HEARD BY GOD
ALONE ALL IS OVER
I SHALL NEVER SEE HER MORE
SHE IS A SMILE WHICH
PASSED OVER ME
I AM ABOUT TO PLUNGE INTO THE NIGHT WITHOUT EVEN SEEING
HER AGAIN
OH ONE MINUTE ONE INSTANT TO HEAR HER VOICE TO TOUCH HER
DRESS TO GAZE UPON HER UPON HER THE ANGEL AND THEN TO DIE IT IS
NOTHING TO DIE WHAT IS FRIGHTFUL IS TO DIE WITHOUT SEEING HER
SHE
WOULD SMILE ON ME SHE WOULD SAY A WORD TO ME WOULD THAT DO ANY HARM TO
ANY ONE NO ALL IS OVER AND FOREVER
HERE I AM ALL ALONE
MY GOD MY
GOD I SHALL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME A KNOCK AT
THE DOOR
CHAPTER IV A BOTTLE OF INK WHICH ONLY SUCCEEDED IN WHITENING
THAT SAME DAY OR TO SPEAK MORE ACCURATELY THAT SAME EVENING AS MARIUS
LEFT THE TABLE AND WAS ON THE POINT OF WITHDRAWING TO HIS STUDY HAVING
A CASE TO LOOK OVER BASQUE HANDED HIM A LETTER SAYING THE PERSON WHO
WROTE THE LETTER IS IN THE ANTECHAMBER
COSETTE HAD TAKEN THE GRANDFATHER'S ARM AND WAS STROLLING IN THE GARDEN
A LETTER LIKE A MAN MAY HAVE AN UNPREPOSSESSING EXTERIOR
COARSE
PAPER COARSELY FOLDED THE VERY SIGHT OF CERTAIN MISSIVES IS
DISPLEASING
THE LETTER WHICH BASQUE HAD BROUGHT WAS OF THIS SORT
MARIUS TOOK IT
IT SMELLED OF TOBACCO
NOTHING EVOKES A MEMORY LIKE AN
ODOR
MARIUS RECOGNIZED THAT TOBACCO
HE LOOKED AT THE SUPERSCRIPTION
TO MONSIEUR MONSIEUR LE BARON POMMERCI
AT HIS HOTEL THE RECOGNITION
OF THE TOBACCO CAUSED HIM TO RECOGNIZE THE WRITING AS WELL
IT MAY BE
SAID THAT AMAZEMENT HAS ITS LIGHTNING FLASHES
MARIUS WAS AS IT WERE ILLUMINATED BY ONE OF THESE FLASHES
THE SENSE OF SMELL THAT MYSTERIOUS AID TO MEMORY HAD JUST REVIVED A
WHOLE WORLD WITHIN HIM
THIS WAS CERTAINLY THE PAPER THE FASHION
OF FOLDING THE DULL TINT OF INK IT WAS CERTAINLY THE WELL KNOWN
HANDWRITING ESPECIALLY WAS IT THE SAME TOBACCO
THE JONDRETTE GARRET ROSE BEFORE HIS MIND
THUS STRANGE FREAK OF CHANCE ONE OF THE TWO SCENTS WHICH HE HAD SO
DILIGENTLY SOUGHT THE ONE IN CONNECTION WITH WHICH HE HAD LATELY AGAIN
EXERTED SO MANY EFFORTS AND WHICH HE SUPPOSED TO BE FOREVER LOST HAD
COME AND PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM OF ITS OWN ACCORD
HE EAGERLY BROKE THE SEAL AND READ
MONSIEUR LE BARON IF THE SUPREME BEING HAD GIVEN ME THE TALENTS
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN BARON THENARD MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE ACADEMY
OF CIENCES BUT I AM NOT
I ONLY BEAR THE SAME AS HIM HAPPY IF
THIS MEMORY RECOMMENDS ME TO THE ECCELLENCE OF YOUR KINDNESSES
THE BENEFIT WITH WHICH YOU WILL HONOR ME WILL BE RECIPROCLE
I AM IN POSSESSION OF A SECRET CONCERNING AN INDIVIDUAL
THIS INDIVIDUAL CONCERNS YOU
I HOLD THE SECRET AT YOUR DISPOSAL
DESIRING TO HAVE THE HONOR TO BE HUSEFUL TO YOU
I WILL FURNISH
YOU WITH THE SIMPLE MEANS OF DRIVING FROM YOUR HONORABEL FAMILY
THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS NO RIGHT THERE MADAME LA BARONNE BEING
OF LOFTY BIRTH
THE SANCTUARY OF VIRTUE CANNOT COHABIT LONGER
WITH CRIME WITHOUT ABDICATING
I AWATE IN THE ENTICHAMBER THE ORDERS OF MONSIEUR LE BARON
WITH RESPECT
THE LETTER WAS SIGNED THENARD
THIS SIGNATURE WAS NOT FALSE
IT WAS MERELY A TRIFLE ABRIDGED
MOREOVER THE RIGMAROLE AND THE ORTHOGRAPHY COMPLETED THE REVELATION
THE CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN WAS COMPLETE
MARIUS' EMOTION WAS PROFOUND
AFTER A START OF SURPRISE HE UNDERWENT A
FEELING OF HAPPINESS
IF HE COULD NOW BUT FIND THAT OTHER MAN OF WHOM HE
WAS IN SEARCH THE MAN WHO HAD SAVED HIM MARIUS THERE WOULD BE NOTHING
LEFT FOR HIM TO DESIRE
HE OPENED THE DRAWER OF HIS SECRETARY TOOK OUT SEVERAL BANK NOTES
PUT THEM IN HIS POCKET CLOSED THE SECRETARY AGAIN AND RANG THE BELL
BASQUE HALF OPENED THE DOOR
SHOW THE MAN IN SAID MARIUS
BASQUE ANNOUNCED
MONSIEUR THENARD
A MAN ENTERED
A FRESH SURPRISE FOR MARIUS
THE MAN WHO ENTERED WAS AN UTTER STRANGER
TO HIM
THIS MAN WHO WAS OLD MOREOVER HAD A THICK NOSE HIS CHIN SWATHED IN A
CRAVAT GREEN SPECTACLES WITH A DOUBLE SCREEN OF GREEN TAFFETA OVER HIS
EYES AND HIS HAIR WAS PLASTERED AND FLATTENED DOWN ON HIS BROW ON
A LEVEL WITH HIS EYEBROWS LIKE THE WIGS OF ENGLISH COACHMEN IN HIGH
LIFE HIS HAIR WAS GRAY
HE WAS DRESSED IN BLACK FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN
GARMENTS THAT WERE VERY THREADBARE BUT CLEAN A BUNCH OF SEALS DEPENDING
FROM HIS FOB SUGGESTED THE IDEA OF A WATCH
HE HELD IN HIS HAND AN OLD
HAT HE WALKED IN A BENT ATTITUDE AND THE CURVE IN HIS SPINE AUGMENTED
THE PROFUNDITY OF HIS BOW
THE FIRST THING THAT STRUCK THE OBSERVER WAS THAT THIS PERSONAGE'S
COAT WHICH WAS TOO AMPLE ALTHOUGH CAREFULLY BUTTONED HAD NOT BEEN MADE
FOR HIM
HERE A SHORT DIGRESSION BECOMES NECESSARY
THERE WAS IN PARIS AT THAT EPOCH IN A LOW LIVED OLD LODGING IN THE RUE
BEAUTREILLIS NEAR THE ARSENAL AN INGENIOUS JEW WHOSE PROFESSION WAS
TO CHANGE VILLAINS INTO HONEST MEN
NOT FOR TOO LONG WHICH MIGHT HAVE
PROVED EMBARRASSING FOR THE VILLAIN
THE CHANGE WAS ON SIGHT FOR A DAY
OR TWO AT THE RATE OF THIRTY SOUS A DAY BY MEANS OF A COSTUME WHICH
RESEMBLED THE HONESTY OF THE WORLD IN GENERAL AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE
THIS COSTUMER WAS CALLED THE CHANGER THE PICKPOCKETS OF PARIS
HAD GIVEN HIM THIS NAME AND KNEW HIM BY NO OTHER
HE HAD A TOLERABLY
COMPLETE WARDROBE
THE RAGS WITH WHICH HE TRICKED OUT PEOPLE WERE ALMOST
PROBABLE
HE HAD SPECIALTIES AND CATEGORIES ON EACH NAIL OF HIS
SHOP HUNG A SOCIAL STATUS THREADBARE AND WORN HERE THE SUIT OF A
MAGISTRATE THERE THE OUTFIT OF A CURE BEYOND THE OUTFIT OF A BANKER
IN ONE CORNER THE COSTUME OF A RETIRED MILITARY MAN ELSEWHERE
THE HABILIMENTS OF A MAN OF LETTERS AND FURTHER ON THE DRESS OF A
STATESMAN
THIS CREATURE WAS THE COSTUMER OF THE IMMENSE DRAMA WHICH KNAVERY PLAYS
IN PARIS
HIS LAIR WAS THE GREEN ROOM WHENCE THEFT EMERGED AND INTO
WHICH ROGUERY RETREATED
A TATTERED KNAVE ARRIVED AT THIS DRESSING ROOM
DEPOSITED HIS THIRTY SOUS AND SELECTED ACCORDING TO THE PART WHICH
HE WISHED TO PLAY THE COSTUME WHICH SUITED HIM AND ON DESCENDING THE
STAIRS ONCE MORE THE KNAVE WAS A SOMEBODY
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE
CLOTHES WERE FAITHFULLY RETURNED AND THE CHANGER WHO TRUSTED THE
THIEVES WITH EVERYTHING WAS NEVER ROBBED
THERE WAS ONE INCONVENIENCE
ABOUT THESE CLOTHES THEY DID NOT FIT NOT HAVING BEEN MADE FOR THOSE
WHO WORE THEM THEY WERE TOO TIGHT FOR ONE TOO LOOSE FOR ANOTHER AND
DID NOT ADJUST THEMSELVES TO ANY ONE
EVERY PICKPOCKET WHO EXCEEDED OR
FELL SHORT OF THE HUMAN AVERAGE WAS ILL AT HIS EASE IN THE CHANGER'S
COSTUMES
IT WAS NECESSARY THAT ONE SHOULD NOT BE EITHER TOO FAT OR
TOO LEAN
THE CHANGER HAD FORESEEN ONLY ORDINARY MEN
HE HAD TAKEN THE
MEASURE OF THE SPECIES FROM THE FIRST RASCAL WHO CAME TO HAND WHO IS
NEITHER STOUT NOR THIN NEITHER TALL NOR SHORT
HENCE ADAPTATIONS WHICH
WERE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT AND FROM WHICH THE CHANGER'S CLIENTS EXTRICATED
THEMSELVES AS BEST THEY MIGHT
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THE EXCEPTIONS
THE SUIT OF THE STATESMAN FOR INSTANCE BLACK FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND
CONSEQUENTLY PROPER WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO LARGE FOR PITT AND TOO SMALL
FOR CASTELCICALA
THE COSTUME OF A STATESMAN WAS DESIGNATED AS FOLLOWS
IN THE CHANGER'S CATALOGUE WE COPY
A COAT OF BLACK CLOTH TROWSERS OF BLACK WOOL A SILK WAISTCOAT BOOTS
AND LINEN ON THE MARGIN THERE STOOD EX AMBASSADOR AND A NOTE
WHICH WE ALSO COPY IN A SEPARATE BOX A NEATLY FRIZZED PERUKE GREEN
GLASSES SEALS AND TWO SMALL QUILLS AN INCH LONG WRAPPED IN COTTON
ALL THIS BELONGED TO THE STATESMAN THE EX AMBASSADOR
THIS WHOLE
COSTUME WAS IF WE MAY SO EXPRESS OURSELVES DEBILITATED THE SEAMS WERE
WHITE A VAGUE BUTTON HOLE YAWNED AT ONE OF THE ELBOWS MOREOVER ONE OF
THE COAT BUTTONS WAS MISSING ON THE BREAST BUT THIS WAS ONLY DETAIL AS
THE HAND OF THE STATESMAN SHOULD ALWAYS BE THRUST INTO HIS COAT AND LAID
UPON HIS HEART ITS FUNCTION WAS TO CONCEAL THE ABSENT BUTTON
IF MARIUS HAD BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE OCCULT INSTITUTIONS OF PARIS HE
WOULD INSTANTLY HAVE RECOGNIZED UPON THE BACK OF THE VISITOR WHOM
BASQUE HAD JUST SHOWN IN THE STATESMAN'S SUIT BORROWED FROM THE
PICK ME DOWN THAT SHOP OF THE CHANGER
MARIUS' DISAPPOINTMENT ON BEHOLDING ANOTHER MAN THAN THE ONE WHOM HE
EXPECTED TO SEE TURNED TO THE NEWCOMER'S DISADVANTAGE
HE SURVEYED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT WHILE THAT PERSONAGE MADE EXAGGERATED
BOWS AND DEMANDED IN A CURT TONE
WHAT DO YOU WANT
THE MAN REPLIED WITH AN AMIABLE GRIN OF WHICH THE CARESSING SMILE OF A
CROCODILE WILL FURNISH SOME IDEA
IT SEEMS TO ME IMPOSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOR
OF SEEING MONSIEUR LE BARON IN SOCIETY
I THINK I ACTUALLY DID MEET
MONSIEUR PERSONALLY SEVERAL YEARS AGO AT THE HOUSE OF MADAME LA
PRINCESSE BAGRATION AND IN THE DRAWING ROOMS OF HIS LORDSHIP THE VICOMTE
DAMBRAY PEER OF FRANCE
IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD BIT OF TACTICS IN KNAVERY TO PRETEND TO RECOGNIZE
SOME ONE WHOM ONE DOES NOT KNOW
MARIUS PAID ATTENTION TO THE MANNER OF THIS MAN'S SPEECH
HE SPIED
ON HIS ACCENT AND GESTURE BUT HIS DISAPPOINTMENT INCREASED THE
PRONUNCIATION WAS NASAL AND ABSOLUTELY UNLIKE THE DRY SHRILL TONE WHICH
HE HAD EXPECTED
HE WAS UTTERLY ROUTED
I KNOW NEITHER MADAME BAGRATION NOR M
DAMBRAY SAID HE
I HAVE NEVER
SET FOOT IN THE HOUSE OF EITHER OF THEM IN MY LIFE
THE REPLY WAS UNGRACIOUS
THE PERSONAGE DETERMINED TO BE GRACIOUS AT
ANY COST INSISTED
THEN IT MUST HAVE BEEN AT CHATEAUBRIAND'S THAT I HAVE SEEN MONSIEUR I
KNOW CHATEAUBRIAND VERY WELL
HE IS VERY AFFABLE
HE SOMETIMES SAYS TO
ME 'THENARD MY FRIEND
WON'T YOU DRINK A GLASS OF WINE WITH ME
MARIUS' BROW GREW MORE AND MORE SEVERE
I HAVE NEVER HAD THE HONOR OF BEING RECEIVED BY M
DE CHATEAUBRIAND
LET US CUT IT SHORT
WHAT DO YOU WANT
THE MAN BOWED LOWER AT THAT HARSH VOICE
MONSIEUR LE BARON DEIGN TO LISTEN TO ME
THERE IS IN AMERICA IN A
DISTRICT NEAR PANAMA A VILLAGE CALLED LA JOYA
THAT VILLAGE IS COMPOSED
OF A SINGLE HOUSE A LARGE SQUARE HOUSE OF THREE STORIES BUILT OF
BRICKS DRIED IN THE SUN EACH SIDE OF THE SQUARE FIVE HUNDRED FEET IN
LENGTH EACH STORY RETREATING TWELVE FEET BACK OF THE STORY BELOW IN
SUCH A MANNER AS TO LEAVE IN FRONT A TERRACE WHICH MAKES THE CIRCUIT
OF THE EDIFICE IN THE CENTRE AN INNER COURT WHERE THE PROVISIONS AND
MUNITIONS ARE KEPT NO WINDOWS LOOPHOLES NO DOORS LADDERS LADDERS
TO MOUNT FROM THE GROUND TO THE FIRST TERRACE AND FROM THE FIRST TO THE
SECOND AND FROM THE SECOND TO THE THIRD LADDERS TO DESCEND INTO THE
INNER COURT NO DOORS TO THE CHAMBERS TRAP DOORS NO STAIRCASES TO THE
CHAMBERS LADDERS IN THE EVENING THE TRAPS ARE CLOSED THE LADDERS
ARE WITHDRAWN CARBINES AND BLUNDERBUSSES TRAINED FROM THE LOOPHOLES
NO MEANS OF ENTERING A HOUSE BY DAY A CITADEL BY NIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED
INHABITANTS THAT IS THE VILLAGE
WHY SO MANY PRECAUTIONS BECAUSE THE
COUNTRY IS DANGEROUS IT IS FULL OF CANNIBALS
THEN WHY DO PEOPLE GO
THERE BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS MARVELLOUS GOLD IS FOUND THERE
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT INTERRUPTED MARIUS WHO HAD PASSED FROM
DISAPPOINTMENT TO IMPATIENCE
AT THIS MONSIEUR LE BARON
I AM AN OLD AND WEARY DIPLOMAT
ANCIENT
CIVILIZATION HAS THROWN ME ON MY OWN DEVICES
I WANT TO TRY SAVAGES
WELL
MONSIEUR LE BARON EGOTISM IS THE LAW OF THE WORLD
THE PROLETARIAN
PEASANT WOMAN WHO TOILS BY THE DAY TURNS ROUND WHEN THE DILIGENCE
PASSES BY THE PEASANT PROPRIETRESS WHO TOILS IN HER FIELD DOES NOT
TURN ROUND
THE DOG OF THE POOR MAN BARKS AT THE RICH MAN THE DOG
OF THE RICH MAN BARKS AT THE POOR MAN
EACH ONE FOR HIMSELF
SELF INTEREST THAT'S THE OBJECT OF MEN
GOLD THAT'S THE LOADSTONE
WHAT THEN FINISH
I SHOULD LIKE TO GO AND ESTABLISH MYSELF AT LA JOYA
THERE ARE THREE
OF US
I HAVE MY SPOUSE AND MY YOUNG LADY A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL
THE
JOURNEY IS LONG AND COSTLY
I NEED A LITTLE MONEY
WHAT CONCERN IS THAT OF MINE DEMANDED MARIUS
THE STRANGER STRETCHED HIS NECK OUT OF HIS CRAVAT A GESTURE
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE VULTURE AND REPLIED WITH AN AUGMENTED SMILE
HAS NOT MONSIEUR LE BARON PERUSED MY LETTER
THERE WAS SOME TRUTH IN THIS
THE FACT IS THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE
EPISTLE HAD SLIPPED MARIUS' MIND
HE HAD SEEN THE WRITING RATHER THAN
READ THE LETTER
HE COULD HARDLY RECALL IT
BUT A MOMENT AGO A FRESH
START HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM
HE HAD NOTED THAT DETAIL MY SPOUSE AND MY
YOUNG LADY
HE FIXED A PENETRATING GLANCE ON THE STRANGER
AN EXAMINING JUDGE COULD
NOT HAVE DONE THE LOOK BETTER
HE ALMOST LAY IN WAIT FOR HIM
HE CONFINED HIMSELF TO REPLYING
STATE THE CASE PRECISELY
THE STRANGER INSERTED HIS TWO HANDS IN BOTH HIS FOBS DREW HIMSELF UP
WITHOUT STRAIGHTENING HIS DORSAL COLUMN BUT SCRUTINIZING MARIUS IN HIS
TURN WITH THE GREEN GAZE OF HIS SPECTACLES
SO BE IT MONSIEUR LE BARON
I WILL BE PRECISE
I HAVE A SECRET TO SELL
TO YOU
A SECRET
A SECRET
WHICH CONCERNS ME
SOMEWHAT
WHAT IS THE SECRET
MARIUS SCRUTINIZED THE MAN MORE AND MORE AS HE LISTENED TO HIM
I COMMENCE GRATIS SAID THE STRANGER
YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM
INTERESTING
SPEAK
MONSIEUR LE BARON YOU HAVE IN YOUR HOUSE A THIEF AND AN ASSASSIN
MARIUS SHUDDERED
IN MY HOUSE NO SAID HE
THE IMPERTURBABLE STRANGER BRUSHED HIS HAT WITH HIS ELBOW AND WENT ON
AN ASSASSIN AND A THIEF
REMARK MONSIEUR LE BARON THAT I DO NOT HERE
SPEAK OF ANCIENT DEEDS DEEDS OF THE PAST WHICH HAVE LAPSED WHICH CAN
BE EFFACED BY LIMITATION BEFORE THE LAW AND BY REPENTANCE BEFORE GOD
I SPEAK OF RECENT DEEDS OF ACTUAL FACTS AS STILL UNKNOWN TO JUSTICE
AT THIS HOUR
I CONTINUE
THIS MAN HAS INSINUATED HIMSELF INTO YOUR
CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST INTO YOUR FAMILY UNDER A FALSE NAME
I AM ABOUT
TO TELL YOU HIS REAL NAME
AND TO TELL IT TO YOU FOR NOTHING
I AM LISTENING
HIS NAME IS JEAN VALJEAN
I KNOW IT
I AM GOING TO TELL YOU EQUALLY FOR NOTHING WHO HE IS
SAY ON

I KNOW IT
YOU KNOW IT SINCE I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF TELLING YOU
NO
I KNEW IT BEFORE
MARIUS' COLD TONE THAT DOUBLE REPLY OF I KNOW IT HIS LACONICISM
WHICH WAS NOT FAVORABLE TO DIALOGUE STIRRED UP SOME SMOULDERING WRATH
IN THE STRANGER
HE LAUNCHED A FURIOUS GLANCE ON THE SLY AT MARIUS
WHICH WAS INSTANTLY EXTINGUISHED
RAPID AS IT WAS THIS GLANCE WAS OF
THE KIND WHICH A MAN RECOGNIZES WHEN HE HAS ONCE BEHELD IT IT DID NOT
ESCAPE MARIUS
CERTAIN FLASHES CAN ONLY PROCEED FROM CERTAIN SOULS
THE EYE THAT VENT HOLE OF THE THOUGHT GLOWS WITH IT SPECTACLES HIDE
NOTHING TRY PUTTING A PANE OF GLASS OVER HELL
THE STRANGER RESUMED WITH A SMILE
I WILL NOT PERMIT MYSELF TO CONTRADICT MONSIEUR LE BARON
IN ANY CASE
YOU OUGHT TO PERCEIVE THAT I AM WELL INFORMED
NOW WHAT I HAVE TO TELL
YOU IS KNOWN TO MYSELF ALONE
THIS CONCERNS THE FORTUNE OF MADAME LA
BARONNE
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY SECRET
IT IS FOR SALE I MAKE YOU THE
FIRST OFFER OF IT
CHEAP
TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS
I KNOW THAT SECRET AS WELL AS THE OTHERS SAID MARIUS
THE PERSONAGE FELT THE NECESSITY OF LOWERING HIS PRICE A TRIFLE
MONSIEUR LE BARON SAY TEN THOUSAND FRANCS AND I WILL SPEAK
I REPEAT TO YOU THAT THERE IS NOTHING WHICH YOU CAN TELL ME
I KNOW
WHAT YOU WISH TO SAY TO ME
A FRESH FLASH GLEAMED IN THE MAN'S EYE
HE EXCLAIMED
BUT I MUST DINE TO DAY NEVERTHELESS
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY SECRET
I TELL YOU
MONSIEUR LE BARON I WILL SPEAK
I SPEAK
GIVE ME TWENTY
FRANCS
MARIUS GAZED INTENTLY AT HIM
I KNOW YOUR EXTRAORDINARY SECRET JUST AS I KNEW JEAN VALJEAN'S NAME
JUST AS I KNOW YOUR NAME

THAT IS NOT DIFFICULT MONSIEUR LE BARON
I HAD THE HONOR TO WRITE TO
YOU AND TO TELL IT TO YOU
THENARD
DIER
HEY
THENARDIER
WHO'S THAT
IN DANGER THE PORCUPINE BRISTLES UP THE BEETLE FEIGNS DEATH THE OLD
GUARD FORMS IN A SQUARE THIS MAN BURST INTO LAUGHTER
THEN HE FLICKED A GRAIN OF DUST FROM THE SLEEVE OF HIS COAT WITH A
FILLIP
MARIUS CONTINUED
YOU ARE ALSO JONDRETTE THE WORKMAN FABANTOU THE COMEDIAN GENFLOT THE
POET DON ALVARES THE SPANIARD AND MISTRESS BALIZARD
MISTRESS WHAT
AND YOU KEPT A POT HOUSE AT MONTFERMEIL
A POT HOUSE NEVER
AND I TELL YOU THAT YOUR NAME IS THENARDIER
I DENY IT
AND THAT YOU ARE A RASCAL
HERE
AND MARIUS DREW A BANK NOTE FROM HIS POCKET AND FLUNG IT IN HIS FACE
THANKS PARDON ME FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS MONSIEUR LE BARON
AND THE MAN OVERCOME BOWED SEIZED THE NOTE AND EXAMINED IT
FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS HE BEGAN AGAIN TAKEN ABACK
AND HE STAMMERED IN
A LOW VOICE AN HONEST RUSTLER 69
THEN BRUSQUELY
WELL SO BE IT HE EXCLAIMED
LET US PUT OURSELVES AT OUR EASE
AND WITH THE AGILITY OF A MONKEY FLINGING BACK HIS HAIR TEARING OFF
HIS SPECTACLES AND WITHDRAWING FROM HIS NOSE BY SLEIGHT OF HAND THE TWO
QUILLS OF WHICH MENTION WAS RECENTLY MADE AND WHICH THE READER HAS ALSO
MET WITH ON ANOTHER PAGE OF THIS BOOK HE TOOK OFF HIS FACE AS THE MAN
TAKES OFF HIS HAT
HIS EYE LIGHTED UP HIS UNEVEN BROW WITH HOLLOWS IN SOME PLACES AND
BUMPS IN OTHERS HIDEOUSLY WRINKLED AT THE TOP WAS LAID BARE HIS NOSE
HAD BECOME AS SHARP AS A BEAK THE FIERCE AND SAGACIOUS PROFILE OF THE
MAN OF PREY REAPPEARED
MONSIEUR LE BARON IS INFALLIBLE HE SAID IN A CLEAR VOICE WHENCE ALL
NASAL TWANG HAD DISAPPEARED I AM THENARDIER
AND HE STRAIGHTENED UP HIS CROOKED BACK
THENARDIER FOR IT WAS REALLY HE WAS STRANGELY SURPRISED HE WOULD HAVE
BEEN TROUBLED HAD HE BEEN CAPABLE OF SUCH A THING
HE HAD COME TO BRING
ASTONISHMENT AND IT WAS HE WHO HAD RECEIVED IT
THIS HUMILIATION HAD
BEEN WORTH FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS TO HIM AND TAKING IT ALL IN ALL HE
ACCEPTED IT BUT HE WAS NONE THE LESS BEWILDERED
HE BEHELD THIS BARON PONTMERCY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IN SPITE OF
HIS DISGUISE THIS BARON PONTMERCY RECOGNIZED HIM AND RECOGNIZED
HIM THOROUGHLY
AND NOT ONLY WAS THIS BARON PERFECTLY INFORMED AS TO
THENARDIER BUT HE SEEMED WELL POSTED AS TO JEAN VALJEAN
WHO WAS THIS
ALMOST BEARDLESS YOUNG MAN WHO WAS SO GLACIAL AND SO GENEROUS WHO KNEW
PEOPLE'S NAMES WHO KNEW ALL THEIR NAMES AND WHO OPENED HIS PURSE TO
THEM WHO BULLIED RASCALS LIKE A JUDGE AND WHO PAID THEM LIKE A DUPE
THENARDIER THE READER WILL REMEMBER ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN MARIUS'
NEIGHBOR HAD NEVER SEEN HIM WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL IN PARIS HE HAD
FORMERLY IN A VAGUE WAY HEARD HIS DAUGHTERS TALK OF A VERY POOR YOUNG
MAN NAMED MARIUS WHO LIVED IN THE HOUSE
HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIM WITHOUT
KNOWING HIM THE LETTER WITH WHICH THE READER IS ACQUAINTED
NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT MARIUS AND M
LE BARON PONTMERCY WAS POSSIBLE
IN HIS MIND
AS FOR THE NAME PONTMERCY IT WILL BE RECALLED THAT ON THE BATTLEFIELD
OF WATERLOO HE HAD ONLY HEARD THE LAST TWO SYLLABLES FOR WHICH HE
ALWAYS ENTERTAINED THE LEGITIMATE SCORN WHICH ONE OWES TO WHAT IS MERELY
AN EXPRESSION OF THANKS
HOWEVER THROUGH HIS DAUGHTER AZELMA WHO HAD STARTED ON THE SCENT OF
THE MARRIED PAIR ON THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY AND THROUGH HIS OWN PERSONAL
RESEARCHES HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN LEARNING MANY THINGS AND FROM THE
DEPTHS OF HIS OWN GLOOM HE HAD CONTRIVED TO GRASP MORE THAN ONE
MYSTERIOUS CLEW
HE HAD DISCOVERED BY DINT OF INDUSTRY OR AT LEAST
BY DINT OF INDUCTION HE HAD GUESSED WHO THE MAN WAS WHOM HE HAD
ENCOUNTERED ON A CERTAIN DAY IN THE GRAND SEWER
FROM THE MAN HE HAD
EASILY REACHED THE NAME
HE KNEW THAT MADAME LA BARONNE PONTMERCY WAS
COSETTE
BUT HE MEANT TO BE DISCREET IN THAT QUARTER
WHO WAS COSETTE HE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY HIMSELF
HE DID INDEED CATCH
AN INKLING OF ILLEGITIMACY THE HISTORY OF FANTINE HAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO
HIM EQUIVOCAL BUT WHAT WAS THE USE OF TALKING ABOUT THAT IN ORDER TO
CAUSE HIMSELF TO BE PAID FOR HIS SILENCE HE HAD OR THOUGHT HE HAD
BETTER WARES THAN THAT FOR SALE
AND ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCES IF
HE WERE TO COME AND MAKE TO THE BARON PONTMERCY THIS REVELATION AND
WITHOUT PROOF YOUR WIFE IS A BASTARD THE ONLY RESULT WOULD BE TO
ATTRACT THE BOOT OF THE HUSBAND TOWARDS THE LOINS OF THE REVEALER
FROM THENARDIER'S POINT OF VIEW THE CONVERSATION WITH MARIUS HAD NOT
YET BEGUN
HE OUGHT TO HAVE DRAWN BACK TO HAVE MODIFIED HIS STRATEGY
TO HAVE ABANDONED HIS POSITION TO HAVE CHANGED HIS FRONT BUT NOTHING
ESSENTIAL HAD BEEN COMPROMISED AS YET AND HE HAD FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
IN HIS POCKET
MOREOVER HE HAD SOMETHING DECISIVE TO SAY AND EVEN
AGAINST THIS VERY WELL INFORMED AND WELL ARMED BARON PONTMERCY HE FELT
HIMSELF STRONG
FOR MEN OF THENARDIER'S NATURE EVERY DIALOGUE IS
A COMBAT
IN THE ONE IN WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO ENGAGE WHAT WAS HIS
SITUATION HE DID NOT KNOW TO WHOM HE WAS SPEAKING BUT HE DID KNOW OF
WHAT HE WAS SPEAKING HE MADE THIS RAPID REVIEW OF HIS INNER FORCES AND
AFTER HAVING SAID I AM THENARDIER HE WAITED
MARIUS HAD BECOME THOUGHTFUL
SO HE HAD HOLD OF THENARDIER AT LAST
THAT MAN WHOM HE HAD SO GREATLY DESIRED TO FIND WAS BEFORE HIM
HE COULD
HONOR COLONEL PONTMERCY'S RECOMMENDATION
HE FELT HUMILIATED THAT THAT HERO SHOULD HAVE OWNED ANYTHING TO THIS
VILLAIN AND THAT THE LETTER OF CHANGE DRAWN FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE TOMB
BY HIS FATHER UPON HIM MARIUS HAD BEEN PROTESTED UP TO THAT DAY
IT
ALSO SEEMED TO HIM IN THE COMPLEX STATE OF HIS MIND TOWARDS THENARDIER
THAT THERE WAS OCCASION TO AVENGE THE COLONEL FOR THE MISFORTUNE OF
HAVING BEEN SAVED BY SUCH A RASCAL
IN ANY CASE HE WAS CONTENT
HE
WAS ABOUT TO DELIVER THE COLONEL'S SHADE FROM THIS UNWORTHY CREDITOR
AT LAST AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF RESCUING HIS
FATHER'S MEMORY FROM THE DEBTORS' PRISON
BY THE SIDE OF THIS DUTY THERE
WAS ANOTHER TO ELUCIDATE IF POSSIBLE THE SOURCE OF COSETTE'S FORTUNE
THE OPPORTUNITY APPEARED TO PRESENT ITSELF
PERHAPS THENARDIER KNEW
SOMETHING
IT MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO SEE THE BOTTOM OF THIS MAN
HE COMMENCED WITH THIS
THENARDIER HAD CAUSED THE HONEST RUSTLER TO DISAPPEAR IN HIS FOB AND
WAS GAZING AT MARIUS WITH A GENTLENESS THAT WAS ALMOST TENDER
MARIUS BROKE THE SILENCE
THENARDIER I HAVE TOLD YOU YOUR NAME
NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME
TELL YOU YOUR SECRET THE ONE THAT YOU CAME HERE TO REVEAL TO ME I HAVE
INFORMATION OF MY OWN ALSO
YOU SHALL SEE THAT I KNOW MORE ABOUT IT
THAN YOU DO
JEAN VALJEAN AS YOU HAVE SAID IS AN ASSASSIN AND A THIEF
A THIEF BECAUSE HE ROBBED A WEALTHY MANUFACTURER WHOSE RUIN HE BROUGHT
ABOUT
AN ASSASSIN BECAUSE HE ASSASSINATED POLICE AGENT JAVERT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND SIR EJACULATED THENARDIER
I WILL MAKE MYSELF INTELLIGIBLE
IN A CERTAIN ARRONDISSEMENT OF THE PAS
DE CALAIS THERE WAS IN 1822 A MAN WHO HAD FALLEN OUT WITH JUSTICE
AND WHO UNDER THE NAME OF M
MADELEINE HAD REGAINED HIS STATUS AND
REHABILITATED HIMSELF
THIS MAN HAD BECOME A JUST MAN IN THE FULL FORCE
OF THE TERM
IN A TRADE THE MANUFACTURE OF BLACK GLASS GOODS HE
MADE THE FORTUNE OF AN ENTIRE CITY
AS FAR AS HIS PERSONAL FORTUNE WAS
CONCERNED HE MADE THAT ALSO BUT AS A SECONDARY MATTER AND IN SOME
SORT BY ACCIDENT
HE WAS THE FOSTER FATHER OF THE POOR
HE FOUNDED
HOSPITALS OPENED SCHOOLS VISITED THE SICK DOWERED YOUNG GIRLS
SUPPORTED WIDOWS AND ADOPTED ORPHANS HE WAS LIKE THE GUARDIAN ANGEL OF
THE COUNTRY
HE REFUSED THE CROSS HE WAS APPOINTED MAYOR
A LIBERATED
CONVICT KNEW THE SECRET OF A PENALTY INCURRED BY THIS MAN IN FORMER
DAYS HE DENOUNCED HIM AND HAD HIM ARRESTED AND PROFITED BY THE ARREST
TO COME TO PARIS AND CAUSE THE BANKER LAFFITTE I HAVE THE FACT FROM
THE CASHIER HIMSELF BY MEANS OF A FALSE SIGNATURE TO HAND OVER TO
HIM THE SUM OF OVER HALF A MILLION WHICH BELONGED TO M
MADELEINE
THIS
CONVICT WHO ROBBED M
MADELEINE WAS JEAN VALJEAN
AS FOR THE OTHER FACT
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO TELL ME ABOUT IT EITHER
JEAN VALJEAN KILLED THE
AGENT JAVERT HE SHOT HIM WITH A PISTOL
I THE PERSON WHO IS SPEAKING
TO YOU WAS PRESENT
THENARDIER CAST UPON MARIUS THE SOVEREIGN GLANCE OF A CONQUERED MAN WHO
LAYS HIS HAND ONCE MORE UPON THE VICTORY AND WHO HAS JUST REGAINED IN
ONE INSTANT ALL THE GROUND WHICH HE HAS LOST
BUT THE SMILE RETURNED
INSTANTLY
THE INFERIOR'S TRIUMPH IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS SUPERIOR MUST
BE WHEEDLING
THENARDIER CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING TO MARIUS
MONSIEUR LE BARON WE ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK
AND HE EMPHASIZED THIS PHRASE BY MAKING HIS BUNCH OF SEALS EXECUTE AN
EXPRESSIVE WHIRL
WHAT BROKE FORTH MARIUS DO YOU DISPUTE THAT THESE ARE FACTS
THEY ARE CHIMERAS
THE CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH MONSIEUR LE BARON HONORS
ME RENDERS IT MY DUTY TO TELL HIM SO
TRUTH AND JUSTICE BEFORE ALL
THINGS
I DO NOT LIKE TO SEE FOLKS ACCUSED UNJUSTLY
MONSIEUR LE BARON
JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT ROB M
MADELEINE AND JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT KILL
JAVERT
THIS IS TOO MUCH HOW IS THIS
FOR TWO REASONS
WHAT ARE THEY SPEAK
THIS IS THE FIRST HE DID NOT ROB M
MADELEINE BECAUSE IT IS JEAN
VALJEAN HIMSELF WHO WAS M
MADELEINE
WHAT TALE ARE YOU TELLING ME
AND THIS IS THE SECOND HE DID NOT ASSASSINATE JAVERT BECAUSE THE
PERSON WHO KILLED JAVERT WAS JAVERT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY
THAT JAVERT COMMITTED SUICIDE
PROVE IT PROVE IT CRIED MARIUS BESIDE HIMSELF
THENARDIER RESUMED SCANNING HIS PHRASE AFTER THE MANNER OF THE ANCIENT
ALEXANDRINE MEASURE
POLICE AGENT JA VERT WAS FOUND DROWNED UN DER A BOAT OF THE PONT AU CHANGE
BUT PROVE IT
THENARDIER DREW FROM HIS POCKET A LARGE ENVELOPE OF GRAY PAPER WHICH
SEEMED TO CONTAIN SHEETS FOLDED IN DIFFERENT SIZES
I HAVE MY PAPERS HE SAID CALMLY
AND HE ADDED
MONSIEUR LE BARON IN YOUR INTERESTS I DESIRED TO KNOW JEAN VALJEAN
THOROUGHLY
I SAY THAT JEAN VALJEAN AND M
MADELEINE ARE ONE AND THE
SAME MAN AND I SAY THAT JAVERT HAD NO OTHER ASSASSIN THAN JAVERT
IF
I SPEAK IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE PROOFS
NOT MANUSCRIPT PROOFS WRITING IS
SUSPICIOUS HANDWRITING IS COMPLAISANT BUT PRINTED PROOFS
AS HE SPOKE THENARDIER EXTRACTED FROM THE ENVELOPE TWO COPIES OF
NEWSPAPERS YELLOW FADED AND STRONGLY SATURATED WITH TOBACCO
ONE OF
THESE TWO NEWSPAPERS BROKEN AT EVERY FOLD AND FALLING INTO RAGS SEEMED
MUCH OLDER THAN THE OTHER
TWO FACTS TWO PROOFS REMARKED THENARDIER
AND HE OFFERED THE TWO
NEWSPAPERS UNFOLDED TO MARIUS
THE READER IS ACQUAINTED WITH THESE TWO PAPERS
ONE THE MOST ANCIENT A
NUMBER OF THE DRAPEAU BLANC OF THE 25TH OF JULY 1823 THE TEXT OF
WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN THE FIRST VOLUME ESTABLISHED THE IDENTITY OF M
MADELEINE AND JEAN VALJEAN
THE OTHER A MONITEUR OF THE 15TH OF JUNE 1832 ANNOUNCED THE SUICIDE
OF JAVERT ADDING THAT IT APPEARED FROM A VERBAL REPORT OF JAVERT TO THE
PREFECT THAT HAVING BEEN TAKEN PRISONER IN THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE
LA CHANVRERIE HE HAD OWED HIS LIFE TO THE MAGNANIMITY OF AN INSURGENT
WHO HOLDING HIM UNDER HIS PISTOL HAD FIRED INTO THE AIR INSTEAD OF
BLOWING OUT HIS BRAINS
MARIUS READ
HE HAD EVIDENCE A CERTAIN DATE IRREFRAGABLE PROOF THESE
TWO NEWSPAPERS HAD NOT BEEN PRINTED EXPRESSLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF BACKING
UP THENARDIER'S STATEMENTS THE NOTE PRINTED IN THE MONITEUR HAD BEEN AN
ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNICATION FROM THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE
MARIUS COULD
NOT DOUBT
THE INFORMATION OF THE CASHIER CLERK HAD BEEN FALSE AND HE HIMSELF HAD
BEEN DECEIVED
JEAN VALJEAN WHO HAD SUDDENLY GROWN GRAND EMERGED FROM HIS CLOUD
MARIUS COULD NOT REPRESS A CRY OF JOY
WELL THEN THIS UNHAPPY WRETCH IS AN ADMIRABLE MAN THE WHOLE OF THAT
FORTUNE REALLY BELONGED TO HIM HE IS MADELEINE THE PROVIDENCE OF A
WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE HE IS JEAN VALJEAN JAVERT'S SAVIOR HE IS A HERO HE
IS A SAINT
HE'S NOT A SAINT AND HE'S NOT A HERO SAID THENARDIER
HE'S AN
ASSASSIN AND A ROBBER
AND HE ADDED IN THE TONE OF A MAN WHO BEGINS TO FEEL THAT HE POSSESSES
SOME AUTHORITY
LET US BE CALM
ROBBER ASSASSIN THOSE WORDS WHICH MARIUS THOUGHT HAD DISAPPEARED AND
WHICH RETURNED FELL UPON HIM LIKE AN ICE COLD SHOWER BATH
AGAIN SAID HE
ALWAYS EJACULATED THENARDIER
JEAN VALJEAN DID NOT ROB MADELEINE
BUT HE IS A THIEF
HE DID NOT KILL JAVERT BUT HE IS A MURDERER
WILL YOU SPEAK RETORTED MARIUS OF THAT MISERABLE THEFT COMMITTED
FORTY YEARS AGO AND EXPIATED AS YOUR OWN NEWSPAPERS PROVE BY A WHOLE
LIFE OF REPENTANCE OF SELF ABNEGATION AND OF VIRTUE
I SAY ASSASSINATION AND THEFT MONSIEUR LE BARON AND I REPEAT THAT I
AM SPEAKING OF ACTUAL FACTS
WHAT I HAVE TO REVEAL TO YOU IS ABSOLUTELY
UNKNOWN
IT BELONGS TO UNPUBLISHED MATTER
AND PERHAPS YOU WILL FIND IN
IT THE SOURCE OF THE FORTUNE SO SKILFULLY PRESENTED TO MADAME LA BARONNE
BY JEAN VALJEAN
I SAY SKILFULLY BECAUSE BY A GIFT OF THAT NATURE IT
WOULD NOT BE SO VERY UNSKILFUL TO SLIP INTO AN HONORABLE HOUSE WHOSE
COMFORTS ONE WOULD THEN SHARE AND AT THE SAME STROKE TO CONCEAL ONE'S
CRIME AND TO ENJOY ONE'S THEFT TO BURY ONE'S NAME AND TO CREATE FOR
ONESELF A FAMILY
I MIGHT INTERRUPT YOU AT THIS POINT SAID MARIUS BUT GO ON
MONSIEUR LE BARON I WILL TELL YOU ALL LEAVING THE RECOMPENSE TO YOUR
GENEROSITY
THIS SECRET IS WORTH MASSIVE GOLD
YOU WILL SAY TO ME 'WHY
DO NOT YOU APPLY TO JEAN VALJEAN FOR A VERY SIMPLE REASON I KNOW
THAT HE HAS STRIPPED HIMSELF AND STRIPPED HIMSELF IN YOUR FAVOR AND I
CONSIDER THE COMBINATION INGENIOUS BUT HE HAS NO LONGER A SON HE WOULD
SHOW ME HIS EMPTY HANDS AND SINCE I AM IN NEED OF SOME MONEY FOR
MY TRIP TO LA JOYA I PREFER YOU YOU WHO HAVE IT ALL TO HIM WHO HAS
NOTHING
I AM A LITTLE FATIGUED PERMIT ME TO TAKE A CHAIR
MARIUS SEATED HIMSELF AND MOTIONED TO HIM TO DO THE SAME
THENARDIER INSTALLED HIMSELF ON A TUFTED CHAIR PICKED UP HIS TWO
NEWSPAPERS THRUST THEM BACK INTO THEIR ENVELOPE AND MURMURED AS HE
PECKED AT THE DRAPEAU BLANC WITH HIS NAIL IT COST ME A GOOD DEAL OF
TROUBLE TO GET THIS ONE
THAT DONE HE CROSSED HIS LEGS AND STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT ON THE BACK OF
THE CHAIR AN ATTITUDE CHARACTERISTIC OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SURE OF WHAT
THEY ARE SAYING THEN HE ENTERED UPON HIS SUBJECT GRAVELY EMPHASIZING
HIS WORDS
MONSIEUR LE BARON ON THE 6TH OF JUNE 1832 ABOUT A YEAR AGO ON THE
DAY OF THE INSURRECTION A MAN WAS IN THE GRAND SEWER OF PARIS AT THE
POINT WHERE THE SEWER ENTERS THE SEINE BETWEEN THE PONT DES INVALIDES
AND THE PONT DE JENA
MARIUS ABRUPTLY DREW HIS CHAIR CLOSER TO THAT OF THENARDIER
THENARDIER
NOTICED THIS MOVEMENT AND CONTINUED WITH THE DELIBERATION OF AN ORATOR
WHO HOLDS HIS INTERLOCUTOR AND WHO FEELS HIS ADVERSARY PALPITATING UNDER
HIS WORDS
THIS MAN FORCED TO CONCEAL HIMSELF AND FOR REASONS MOREOVER WHICH
ARE FOREIGN TO POLITICS HAD ADOPTED THE SEWER AS HIS DOMICILE AND HAD
A KEY TO IT
IT WAS I REPEAT ON THE 6TH OF JUNE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
THE MAN HEARS A NOISE IN THE SEWER
GREATLY SURPRISED HE HIDES HIMSELF AND LIES IN WAIT
IT WAS THE SOUND
OF FOOTSTEPS SOME ONE WAS WALKING IN THE DARK AND COMING IN HIS
DIRECTION
STRANGE TO SAY THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN IN THE SEWER BESIDES
HIMSELF
THE GRATING OF THE OUTLET FROM THE SEWER WAS NOT FAR OFF
A LITTLE LIGHT WHICH FELL THROUGH IT PERMITTED HIM TO RECOGNIZE THE
NEWCOMER AND TO SEE THAT THE MAN WAS CARRYING SOMETHING ON HIS BACK
HE WAS WALKING IN A BENT ATTITUDE
THE MAN WHO WAS WALKING IN A BENT
ATTITUDE WAS AN EX CONVICT AND WHAT HE WAS DRAGGING ON HIS SHOULDERS
WAS A CORPSE
ASSASSINATION CAUGHT IN THE VERY ACT IF EVER THERE WAS
SUCH A THING
AS FOR THE THEFT THAT IS UNDERSTOOD ONE DOES NOT KILL
A MAN GRATIS
THIS CONVICT WAS ON HIS WAY TO FLING THE BODY INTO THE
RIVER
ONE FACT IS TO BE NOTICED THAT BEFORE REACHING THE EXIT
GRATING THIS CONVICT WHO HAD COME A LONG DISTANCE IN THE SEWER MUST
NECESSARILY HAVE ENCOUNTERED A FRIGHTFUL QUAGMIRE WHERE IT SEEMS AS
THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE LEFT THE BODY BUT THE SEWERMEN WOULD HAVE FOUND
THE ASSASSINATED MAN THE VERY NEXT DAY WHILE AT WORK ON THE QUAGMIRE
AND THAT DID NOT SUIT THE ASSASSIN'S PLANS
HE HAD PREFERRED TO
TRAVERSE THAT QUAGMIRE WITH HIS BURDEN AND HIS EXERTIONS MUST HAVE BEEN
TERRIBLE FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RISK ONE'S LIFE MORE COMPLETELY I
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE COME OUT OF THAT ALIVE
MARIUS' CHAIR APPROACHED STILL NEARER
THENARDIER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS
TO DRAW A LONG BREATH
HE WENT ON
MONSIEUR LE BARON A SEWER IS NOT THE CHAMP DE MARS
ONE LACKS
EVERYTHING THERE EVEN ROOM
WHEN TWO MEN ARE THERE THEY MUST MEET
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED
THE MAN DOMICILED THERE AND THE PASSER BY WERE
FORCED TO BID EACH OTHER GOOD DAY GREATLY TO THE REGRET OF BOTH
THE
PASSER BY SAID TO THE INHABITANT YOU SEE WHAT I HAVE ON MY BACK I
MUST GET OUT YOU HAVE THE KEY GIVE IT TO ME THAT CONVICT WAS A MAN
OF TERRIBLE STRENGTH
THERE WAS NO WAY OF REFUSING
NEVERTHELESS THE
MAN WHO HAD THE KEY PARLEYED SIMPLY TO GAIN TIME
HE EXAMINED THE DEAD
MAN BUT HE COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THAT THE LATTER WAS YOUNG WELL
DRESSED WITH THE AIR OF BEING RICH AND ALL DISFIGURED WITH BLOOD
WHILE TALKING THE MAN CONTRIVED TO TEAR AND PULL OFF BEHIND WITHOUT
THE ASSASSIN PERCEIVING IT A BIT OF THE ASSASSINATED MAN'S COAT
A
DOCUMENT FOR CONVICTION YOU UNDERSTAND A MEANS OF RECOVERING THE TRACE
OF THINGS AND OF BRINGING HOME THE CRIME TO THE CRIMINAL
HE PUT
THIS DOCUMENT FOR CONVICTION IN HIS POCKET
AFTER WHICH HE OPENED THE
GRATING MADE THE MAN GO OUT WITH HIS EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS BACK CLOSED
THE GRATING AGAIN AND RAN OFF NOT CARING TO BE MIXED UP WITH THE
REMAINDER OF THE ADVENTURE AND ABOVE ALL NOT WISHING TO BE PRESENT
WHEN THE ASSASSIN THREW THE ASSASSINATED MAN INTO THE RIVER
NOW YOU
COMPREHEND
THE MAN WHO WAS CARRYING THE CORPSE WAS JEAN VALJEAN THE
ONE WHO HAD THE KEY IS SPEAKING TO YOU AT THIS MOMENT AND THE PIECE OF
THE COAT
THENARDIER COMPLETED HIS PHRASE BY DRAWING FROM HIS POCKET AND HOLDING
ON A LEVEL WITH HIS EYES NIPPED BETWEEN HIS TWO THUMBS AND HIS TWO
FOREFINGERS A STRIP OF TORN BLACK CLOTH ALL COVERED WITH DARK SPOTS
MARIUS HAD SPRUNG TO HIS FEET PALE HARDLY ABLE TO DRAW HIS BREATH
WITH HIS EYES RIVETED ON THE FRAGMENT OF BLACK CLOTH AND WITHOUT
UTTERING A WORD WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THAT FRAGMENT HE
RETREATED TO THE WALL AND FUMBLED WITH HIS RIGHT HAND ALONG THE WALL FOR
A KEY WHICH WAS IN THE LOCK OF A CUPBOARD NEAR THE CHIMNEY
HE FOUND THE KEY OPENED THE CUPBOARD PLUNGED HIS ARM INTO IT WITHOUT
LOOKING AND WITHOUT HIS FRIGHTENED GAZE QUITTING THE RAG WHICH
THENARDIER STILL HELD OUTSPREAD
BUT THENARDIER CONTINUED
MONSIEUR LE BARON I HAVE THE STRONGEST OF REASONS FOR BELIEVING THAT
THE ASSASSINATED YOUNG MAN WAS AN OPULENT STRANGER LURED INTO A TRAP BY
JEAN VALJEAN AND THE BEARER OF AN ENORMOUS SUM OF MONEY
THE YOUNG MAN WAS MYSELF AND HERE IS THE COAT CRIED MARIUS AND HE
FLUNG UPON THE FLOOR AN OLD BLACK COAT ALL COVERED WITH BLOOD
THEN SNATCHING THE FRAGMENT FROM THE HANDS OF THENARDIER HE CROUCHED
DOWN OVER THE COAT AND LAID THE TORN MORSEL AGAINST THE TATTERED SKIRT
THE RENT FITTED EXACTLY AND THE STRIP COMPLETED THE COAT
THENARDIER WAS PETRIFIED
THIS IS WHAT HE THOUGHT I'M STRUCK ALL OF A HEAP
MARIUS ROSE TO HIS FEET TREMBLING DESPAIRING RADIANT
HE FUMBLED IN HIS POCKET AND STALKED FURIOUSLY TO THENARDIER PRESENTING
TO HIM AND ALMOST THRUSTING IN HIS FACE HIS FIST FILLED WITH BANK NOTES
FOR FIVE HUNDRED AND A THOUSAND FRANCS
YOU ARE AN INFAMOUS WRETCH YOU ARE A LIAR A CALUMNIATOR A VILLAIN
YOU CAME TO ACCUSE THAT MAN YOU HAVE ONLY JUSTIFIED HIM YOU WANTED TO
RUIN HIM YOU HAVE ONLY SUCCEEDED IN GLORIFYING HIM
AND IT IS YOU WHO
ARE THE THIEF AND IT IS YOU WHO ARE THE ASSASSIN I SAW YOU THENARDIER
JONDRETTE IN THAT LAIR ON THE RUE DE L'HOPITAL
I KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT
YOU TO SEND YOU TO THE GALLEYS AND EVEN FURTHER IF I CHOOSE
HERE ARE A
THOUSAND FRANCS BULLY THAT YOU ARE
AND HE FLUNG A THOUSAND FRANC NOTE AT THENARDIER
AH JONDRETTE THENARDIER VILE RASCAL LET THIS SERVE YOU AS A LESSON
YOU DEALER IN SECOND HAND SECRETS MERCHANT OF MYSTERIES RUMMAGER OF
THE SHADOWS WRETCH TAKE THESE FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS AND GET OUT OF HERE
WATERLOO PROTECTS YOU
WATERLOO GROWLED THENARDIER POCKETING THE FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS ALONG
WITH THE THOUSAND
YES ASSASSIN YOU THERE SAVED THE LIFE OF A COLONEL
OF A GENERAL SAID THENARDIER ELEVATING HIS HEAD
OF A COLONEL REPEATED MARIUS IN A RAGE
I WOULDN'T GIVE A HA'PENNY
FOR A GENERAL
AND YOU COME HERE TO COMMIT INFAMIES I TELL YOU THAT
YOU HAVE COMMITTED ALL CRIMES
GO DISAPPEAR ONLY BE HAPPY THAT IS ALL
THAT I DESIRE
AH MONSTER HERE ARE THREE THOUSAND FRANCS MORE

FOR YOUR WIFE IS DEAD YOU ABOMINABLE LIAR
I SHALL WATCH OVER YOUR
DEPARTURE YOU RUFFIAN AND AT THAT MOMENT I WILL COUNT OUT TO YOU
TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS
GO GET YOURSELF HUNG ELSEWHERE
MONSIEUR LE BARON REPLIED THENARDIER BOWING TO THE VERY EARTH
ETERNAL GRATITUDE AND THENARDIER LEFT THE ROOM UNDERSTANDING
NOTHING STUPEFIED AND DELIGHTED WITH THIS SWEET CRUSHING BENEATH SACKS
OF GOLD AND WITH THAT THUNDER WHICH HAD BURST FORTH OVER HIS HEAD IN
BANK BILLS
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING HE WAS BUT HE WAS ALSO CONTENT AND HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN GREATLY ANGERED HAD HE HAD A LIGHTNING ROD TO WARD OFF SUCH
LIGHTNING AS THAT
LET US FINISH WITH THIS MAN AT ONCE
TWO DAYS AFTER THE EVENTS WHICH WE ARE AT THIS MOMENT NARRATING HE SET
OUT THANKS TO MARIUS' CARE FOR AMERICA UNDER A FALSE NAME WITH HIS

EUROPE
CONTACT WITH AN EVIL MAN SOMETIMES SUFFICES TO CORRUPT A GOOD
ACTION AND TO CAUSE EVIL THINGS TO SPRING FROM IT

WHERE COSETTE WAS STILL WALKING
COSETTE COSETTE HE CRIED

COSETTE
AH COSETTE I AM AN UNHAPPY WRETCH SAID HE
MARIUS WAS BEWILDERED
HE BEGAN TO CATCH A GLIMPSE IN JEAN VALJEAN OF
SOME INDESCRIBABLY LOFTY AND MELANCHOLY FIGURE
AN UNHEARD OF VIRTUE
SUPREME AND SWEET HUMBLE IN ITS IMMENSITY APPEARED TO HIM
THE CONVICT
WAS TRANSFIGURED INTO CHRIST
MARIUS WAS DAZZLED BY THIS PRODIGY
HE DID NOT KNOW PRECISELY WHAT HE
BEHELD BUT IT WAS GRAND
IN AN INSTANT A HACKNEY CARRIAGE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE DOOR
MARIUS HELPED COSETTE IN AND DARTED IN HIMSELF
DRIVER SAID HE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME NUMBER 7

BARRICADE TO SAVE ME
AS IT IS A NECESSITY WITH HIM TO BE AN ANGEL HE
SAVED OTHERS ALSO HE SAVED JAVERT
HE RESCUED ME FROM THAT GULF TO GIVE
ME TO YOU
HE CARRIED ME ON HIS BACK THROUGH THAT FRIGHTFUL SEWER

SHOULD BE DO YOU SEE COSETTE GAVROCHE MUST HAVE DELIVERED MY LETTER
TO HIM

YOU UNDERSTAND
COSETTE DID NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD
YOU ARE RIGHT SHE SAID TO HIM
MEANWHILE THE CARRIAGE ROLLED ON
CHAPTER V A NIGHT BEHIND WHICH THERE IS DAY
JEAN VALJEAN TURNED ROUND AT THE KNOCK WHICH HE HEARD ON HIS DOOR
COME IN HE SAID FEEBLY
THE DOOR OPENED
COSETTE AND MARIUS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE
COSETTE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM
MARIUS REMAINED ON THE THRESHOLD LEANING AGAINST THE JAMB OF THE DOOR
COSETTE SAID JEAN VALJEAN
AND HE SAT ERECT IN HIS CHAIR HIS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED AND TREMBLING
HAGGARD LIVID GLOOMY AN IMMENSE JOY IN HIS EYES
COSETTE STIFLING WITH EMOTION FELL UPON JEAN VALJEAN'S BREAST
FATHER SAID SHE
JEAN VALJEAN OVERCOME STAMMERED
COSETTE SHE YOU MADAME IT IS THOU AH MY GOD
AND PRESSED CLOSE IN COSETTE'S ARMS HE EXCLAIMED
IT IS THOU THOU ART HERE THOU DOST PARDON ME THEN
MARIUS LOWERING HIS EYELIDS IN ORDER TO KEEP HIS TEARS FROM FLOWING
TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND MURMURED BETWEEN LIPS CONVULSIVELY CONTRACTED TO
REPRESS HIS SOBS
MY FATHER
AND YOU ALSO YOU PARDON ME JEAN VALJEAN SAID TO HIM
MARIUS COULD FIND NO WORDS AND JEAN VALJEAN ADDED
THANKS
COSETTE TORE OFF HER SHAWL AND TOSSED HER HAT ON THE BED
IT EMBARRASSES ME SAID SHE
AND SEATING HERSELF ON THE OLD MAN'S KNEES SHE PUT ASIDE HIS WHITE
LOCKS WITH AN ADORABLE MOVEMENT AND KISSED HIS BROW
JEAN VALJEAN BEWILDERED LET HER HAVE HER OWN WAY
COSETTE WHO ONLY UNDERSTOOD IN A VERY CONFUSED MANNER REDOUBLED HER
CARESSES AS THOUGH SHE DESIRED TO PAY MARIUS' DEBT
JEAN VALJEAN STAMMERED
HOW STUPID PEOPLE ARE I THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN
IMAGINE MONSIEUR PONTMERCY AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN YOU ENTERED I
WAS SAYING TO MYSELF 'ALL IS OVER
HERE IS HER LITTLE GOWN I AM A
MISERABLE MAN I SHALL NEVER SEE COSETTE AGAIN AND I WAS SAYING THAT
AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE MOUNTING THE STAIRS
WAS NOT I AN
IDIOT JUST SEE HOW IDIOTIC ONE CAN BE ONE RECKONS WITHOUT THE GOOD
GOD
THE GOOD GOD SAYS
'YOU FANCY THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE ABANDONED STUPID NO
NO THINGS
WILL NOT GO SO
COME THERE IS A GOOD MAN YONDER WHO IS IN NEED OF AN
ANGEL AND THE ANGEL COMES AND ONE SEES ONE'S COSETTE AGAIN AND ONE
SEES ONE'S LITTLE COSETTE ONCE MORE AH I WAS VERY UNHAPPY
FOR A MOMENT HE COULD NOT SPEAK THEN HE WENT ON
I REALLY NEEDED TO SEE COSETTE A LITTLE BIT NOW AND THEN
A HEART NEEDS
A BONE TO GNAW
BUT I WAS PERFECTLY CONSCIOUS THAT I WAS IN THE WAY
I
GAVE MYSELF REASONS 'THEY DO NOT WANT YOU KEEP IN YOUR OWN COURSE
ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO CLING ETERNALLY AH GOD BE PRAISED I SEE HER
ONCE MORE DOST THOU KNOW COSETTE THY HUSBAND IS VERY HANDSOME AH
WHAT A PRETTY EMBROIDERED COLLAR THOU HAST ON LUCKILY

THAT PATTERN
IT WAS THY HUSBAND WHO CHOSE IT WAS IT NOT AND THEN
THOU SHOULDST HAVE SOME CASHMERE SHAWLS
LET ME CALL HER THOU MONSIEUR
PONTMERCY
IT WILL NOT BE FOR LONG
AND COSETTE BEGAN AGAIN
HOW WICKED OF YOU TO HAVE LEFT US LIKE THAT WHERE DID YOU GO WHY HAVE
YOU STAYED AWAY SO LONG FORMERLY YOUR JOURNEYS ONLY LASTED THREE OR
FOUR DAYS
I SENT NICOLETTE THE ANSWER ALWAYS WAS 'HE IS ABSENT HOW
LONG HAVE YOU BEEN BACK WHY DID YOU NOT LET US KNOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
YOU ARE VERY MUCH CHANGED AH WHAT A NAUGHTY FATHER HE HAS BEEN ILL
AND WE HAVE NOT KNOWN IT STAY MARIUS FEEL HOW COLD HIS HAND IS
SO YOU ARE HERE MONSIEUR PONTMERCY YOU PARDON ME REPEATED JEAN
VALJEAN
AT THAT WORD WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAD JUST UTTERED ONCE MORE ALL THAT WAS
SWELLING MARIUS' HEART FOUND VENT
HE BURST FORTH
COSETTE DO YOU HEAR HE HAS COME TO THAT HE ASKS MY FORGIVENESS AND
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR ME COSETTE HE HAS SAVED MY LIFE
HE
HAS DONE MORE HE HAS GIVEN YOU TO ME
AND AFTER HAVING SAVED ME AND
AFTER HAVING GIVEN YOU TO ME COSETTE WHAT HAS HE DONE WITH HIMSELF HE
HAS SACRIFICED HIMSELF
BEHOLD THE MAN
AND HE SAYS TO ME THE INGRATE
TO ME THE FORGETFUL TO ME THE PITILESS TO ME THE GUILTY ONE THANKS
COSETTE MY WHOLE LIFE PASSED AT THE FEET OF THIS MAN WOULD BE TOO
LITTLE
THAT BARRICADE THAT SEWER THAT FURNACE THAT CESSPOOL ALL
THAT HE TRAVERSED FOR ME FOR THEE COSETTE HE CARRIED ME AWAY THROUGH
ALL THE DEATHS WHICH HE PUT ASIDE BEFORE ME AND ACCEPTED FOR HIMSELF
EVERY COURAGE EVERY VIRTUE EVERY HEROISM EVERY SANCTITY HE POSSESSES
COSETTE THAT MAN IS AN ANGEL
HUSH HUSH SAID JEAN VALJEAN IN A LOW VOICE
WHY TELL ALL THAT
BUT YOU CRIED MARIUS WITH A WRATH IN WHICH THERE WAS VENERATION WHY
DID YOU NOT TELL IT TO ME IT IS YOUR OWN FAULT TOO
YOU SAVE PEOPLE'S
LIVES AND YOU CONCEAL IT FROM THEM YOU DO MORE UNDER THE PRETEXT OF
UNMASKING YOURSELF YOU CALUMNIATE YOURSELF
IT IS FRIGHTFUL
I TOLD THE TRUTH REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN
NO RETORTED MARIUS THE TRUTH IS THE WHOLE TRUTH AND THAT YOU DID
NOT TELL
YOU WERE MONSIEUR MADELEINE WHY NOT HAVE SAID SO YOU SAVED
JAVERT WHY NOT HAVE SAID SO I OWED MY LIFE TO YOU WHY NOT HAVE SAID
SO
BECAUSE I THOUGHT AS YOU DO
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE IN THE RIGHT
IT
WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD GO AWAY
IF YOU HAD KNOWN ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
OF THE SEWER YOU WOULD HAVE MADE ME REMAIN NEAR YOU
I WAS THEREFORE
FORCED TO HOLD MY PEACE
IF I HAD SPOKEN IT WOULD HAVE CAUSED
EMBARRASSMENT IN EVERY WAY
IT WOULD HAVE EMBARRASSED WHAT EMBARRASSED WHOM RETORTED MARIUS
DO
YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO STAY HERE WE SHALL CARRY YOU OFF
AH
GOOD HEAVENS WHEN I REFLECT THAT IT WAS BY AN ACCIDENT THAT I HAVE
LEARNED ALL THIS
YOU FORM A PART OF OURSELVES
YOU ARE HER FATHER
AND MINE
YOU SHALL NOT PASS ANOTHER DAY IN THIS DREADFUL HOUSE
DO NOT
IMAGINE THAT YOU WILL BE HERE TO MORROW
TO MORROW SAID JEAN VALJEAN I SHALL NOT BE HERE BUT I SHALL NOT BE
WITH YOU
WHAT DO YOU MEAN REPLIED MARIUS
AH COME NOW WE ARE NOT GOING TO
PERMIT ANY MORE JOURNEYS
YOU SHALL NEVER LEAVE US AGAIN
YOU BELONG TO
US
WE SHALL NOT LOOSE OUR HOLD OF YOU
THIS TIME IT IS FOR GOOD ADDED COSETTE
WE HAVE A CARRIAGE AT THE
DOOR
I SHALL RUN AWAY WITH YOU
IF NECESSARY I SHALL EMPLOY FORCE
AND SHE LAUGHINGLY MADE A MOVEMENT TO LIFT THE OLD MAN IN HER ARMS
YOUR CHAMBER STILL STANDS READY IN OUR HOUSE SHE WENT ON
IF YOU
ONLY KNEW HOW PRETTY THE GARDEN IS NOW THE AZALEAS ARE DOING VERY
WELL THERE
THE WALKS ARE SANDED WITH RIVER SAND THERE ARE TINY VIOLET
SHELLS
YOU SHALL EAT MY STRAWBERRIES
I WATER THEM MYSELF
AND NO
MORE 'MADAME NO MORE 'MONSIEUR JEAN WE ARE LIVING UNDER A REPUBLIC
EVERYBODY SAYS THOU DON'T THEY MARIUS THE PROGRAMME IS CHANGED
IF
YOU ONLY KNEW FATHER I HAVE HAD A SORROW THERE WAS A ROBIN REDBREAST
WHICH HAD MADE HER NEST IN A HOLE IN THE WALL AND A HORRIBLE CAT ATE
HER
MY POOR PRETTY LITTLE ROBIN RED BREAST WHICH USED TO PUT HER HEAD
OUT OF HER WINDOW AND LOOK AT ME I CRIED OVER IT
I SHOULD HAVE LIKED
TO KILL THE CAT
BUT NOW NOBODY CRIES ANY MORE
EVERYBODY LAUGHS
EVERYBODY IS HAPPY
YOU ARE GOING TO COME WITH US
HOW DELIGHTED
GRANDFATHER WILL BE YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR PLOT IN THE GARDEN YOU SHALL
CULTIVATE IT AND WE SHALL SEE WHETHER YOUR STRAWBERRIES ARE AS FINE AS
MINE
AND THEN I SHALL DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU WISH AND THEN YOU WILL
OBEY ME PRETTILY
JEAN VALJEAN LISTENED TO HER WITHOUT HEARING HER
HE HEARD THE MUSIC OF
HER VOICE RATHER THAN THE SENSE OF HER WORDS ONE OF THOSE LARGE TEARS
WHICH ARE THE SOMBRE PEARLS OF THE SOUL WELLED UP SLOWLY IN HIS EYES
HE MURMURED
THE PROOF THAT GOD IS GOOD IS THAT SHE IS HERE
FATHER SAID COSETTE
JEAN VALJEAN CONTINUED
IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT IT WOULD BE CHARMING FOR US TO LIVE TOGETHER
THEIR TREES ARE FULL OF BIRDS
I WOULD WALK WITH COSETTE
IT IS SWEET TO
BE AMONG LIVING PEOPLE WHO BID EACH OTHER 'GOOD DAY WHO CALL TO EACH
OTHER IN THE GARDEN
PEOPLE SEE EACH OTHER FROM EARLY MORNING
WE
SHOULD EACH CULTIVATE OUR OWN LITTLE CORNER
SHE WOULD MAKE ME EAT HER
STRAWBERRIES
I WOULD MAKE HER GATHER MY ROSES
THAT WOULD BE CHARMING
ONLY
HE PAUSED AND SAID GENTLY
IT IS A PITY
THE TEAR DID NOT FALL IT RETREATED AND JEAN VALJEAN REPLACED IT WITH A
SMILE
COSETTE TOOK BOTH THE OLD MAN'S HANDS IN HERS
MY GOD SAID SHE YOUR HANDS ARE STILL COLDER THAN BEFORE
ARE YOU
ILL DO YOU SUFFER
I NO REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN
I AM VERY WELL
ONLY
HE PAUSED
ONLY WHAT
I AM GOING TO DIE PRESENTLY
COSETTE AND MARIUS SHUDDERED
TO DIE EXCLAIMED MARIUS
YES BUT THAT IS NOTHING SAID JEAN VALJEAN
HE TOOK BREATH SMILED AND RESUMED
COSETTE THOU WERT TALKING TO ME GO ON SO THY LITTLE ROBIN RED BREAST
IS DEAD SPEAK SO THAT I MAY HEAR THY VOICE
MARIUS GAZED AT THE OLD MAN IN AMAZEMENT
COSETTE UTTERED A HEARTRENDING CRY
FATHER MY FATHER YOU WILL LIVE
YOU ARE GOING TO LIVE
I INSIST UPON
YOUR LIVING DO YOU HEAR
JEAN VALJEAN RAISED HIS HEAD TOWARDS HER WITH ADORATION
OH YES FORBID ME TO DIE
WHO KNOWS PERHAPS I SHALL OBEY
I WAS ON
THE VERGE OF DYING WHEN YOU CAME
THAT STOPPED ME IT SEEMED TO ME THAT
I WAS BORN AGAIN
YOU ARE FULL OF STRENGTH AND LIFE CRIED MARIUS
DO YOU IMAGINE THAT
A PERSON CAN DIE LIKE THIS YOU HAVE HAD SORROW YOU SHALL HAVE NO MORE
IT IS I WHO ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS AND ON MY KNEES YOU ARE GOING TO
LIVE AND TO LIVE WITH US AND TO LIVE A LONG TIME
WE TAKE POSSESSION
OF YOU ONCE MORE
THERE ARE TWO OF US HERE WHO WILL HENCEFORTH HAVE NO
OTHER THOUGHT THAN YOUR HAPPINESS
YOU SEE RESUMED COSETTE ALL BATHED IN TEARS THAT MARIUS SAYS THAT
YOU SHALL NOT DIE
JEAN VALJEAN CONTINUED TO SMILE
EVEN IF YOU WERE TO TAKE POSSESSION OF ME MONSIEUR PONTMERCY WOULD
THAT MAKE ME OTHER THAN I AM NO GOD HAS THOUGHT LIKE YOU AND MYSELF
AND HE DOES NOT CHANGE HIS MIND IT IS USEFUL FOR ME TO GO
DEATH IS
A GOOD ARRANGEMENT
GOD KNOWS BETTER THAN WE WHAT WE NEED
MAY YOU BE
HAPPY MAY MONSIEUR PONTMERCY HAVE COSETTE MAY YOUTH WED THE MORNING
MAY THERE BE AROUND YOU MY CHILDREN LILACS AND NIGHTINGALES MAY YOUR
LIFE BE A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY LAWN MAY ALL THE ENCHANTMENTS OF HEAVEN FILL
YOUR SOULS AND NOW LET ME WHO AM GOOD FOR NOTHING DIE IT IS CERTAIN
THAT ALL THIS IS RIGHT
COME BE REASONABLE NOTHING IS POSSIBLE NOW I
AM FULLY CONSCIOUS THAT ALL IS OVER
AND THEN LAST NIGHT I DRANK THAT
WHOLE JUG OF WATER
HOW GOOD THY HUSBAND IS COSETTE THOU ART MUCH
BETTER OFF WITH HIM THAN WITH ME
A NOISE BECAME AUDIBLE AT THE DOOR
IT WAS THE DOCTOR ENTERING
GOOD DAY AND FAREWELL DOCTOR SAID JEAN VALJEAN
HERE ARE MY POOR
CHILDREN
MARIUS STEPPED UP TO THE DOCTOR
HE ADDRESSED TO HIM ONLY THIS SINGLE
WORD MONSIEUR
BUT HIS MANNER OF PRONOUNCING IT CONTAINED A
COMPLETE QUESTION
THE DOCTOR REPLIED TO THE QUESTION BY AN EXPRESSIVE GLANCE
BECAUSE THINGS ARE NOT AGREEABLE SAID JEAN VALJEAN THAT IS NO
REASON FOR BEING UNJUST TOWARDS GOD
A SILENCE ENSUED
ALL BREASTS WERE OPPRESSED
JEAN VALJEAN TURNED TO COSETTE
HE BEGAN TO GAZE AT HER AS THOUGH HE
WISHED TO RETAIN HER FEATURES FOR ETERNITY
IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SHADOW INTO WHICH HE HAD ALREADY DESCENDED ECSTASY
WAS STILL POSSIBLE TO HIM WHEN GAZING AT COSETTE
THE REFLECTION OF THAT
SWEET FACE LIGHTED UP HIS PALE VISAGE
THE DOCTOR FELT OF HIS PULSE
AH IT WAS YOU THAT HE WANTED HE MURMURED LOOKING AT COSETTE AND
MARIUS
AND BENDING DOWN TO MARIUS' EAR HE ADDED IN A VERY LOW VOICE
TOO LATE
JEAN VALJEAN SURVEYED THE DOCTOR AND MARIUS SERENELY ALMOST WITHOUT
CEASING TO GAZE AT COSETTE
THESE BARELY ARTICULATE WORDS WERE HEARD TO ISSUE FROM HIS MOUTH
IT IS NOTHING TO DIE IT IS DREADFUL NOT TO LIVE
ALL AT ONCE HE ROSE TO HIS FEET
THESE ACCESSES OF STRENGTH ARE
SOMETIMES THE SIGN OF THE DEATH AGONY
HE WALKED WITH A FIRM STEP TO
THE WALL THRUSTING ASIDE MARIUS AND THE DOCTOR WHO TRIED TO HELP HIM
DETACHED FROM THE WALL A LITTLE COPPER CRUCIFIX WHICH WAS SUSPENDED
THERE AND RETURNED TO HIS SEAT WITH ALL THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF
PERFECT HEALTH AND SAID IN A LOUD VOICE AS HE LAID THE CRUCIFIX ON THE
TABLE
BEHOLD THE GREAT MARTYR
THEN HIS CHEST SANK IN HIS HEAD WAVERED AS THOUGH THE INTOXICATION OF
THE TOMB WERE SEIZING HOLD UPON HIM
HIS HANDS WHICH RESTED ON HIS KNEES BEGAN TO PRESS THEIR NAILS INTO
THE STUFF OF HIS TROUSERS
COSETTE SUPPORTED HIS SHOULDERS AND SOBBED AND TRIED TO SPEAK TO HIM
BUT COULD NOT
AMONG THE WORDS MINGLED WITH THAT MOURNFUL SALIVA WHICH ACCOMPANIES
TEARS THEY DISTINGUISHED WORDS LIKE THE FOLLOWING
FATHER DO NOT LEAVE US
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE HAVE FOUND YOU ONLY TO
LOSE YOU AGAIN
IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT AGONY WRITHES
IT GOES COMES ADVANCES TOWARDS
THE SEPULCHRE AND RETURNS TOWARDS LIFE
THERE IS GROPING IN THE ACTION
OF DYING
JEAN VALJEAN RALLIED AFTER THIS SEMI SWOON SHOOK HIS BROW AS THOUGH
TO MAKE THE SHADOWS FALL AWAY FROM IT AND BECAME ALMOST PERFECTLY LUCID
ONCE MORE
HE TOOK A FOLD OF COSETTE'S SLEEVE AND KISSED IT
HE IS COMING BACK DOCTOR HE IS COMING BACK CRIED MARIUS
YOU ARE GOOD BOTH OF YOU SAID JEAN VALJEAN
I AM GOING TO TELL YOU
WHAT HAS CAUSED ME PAIN
WHAT HAS PAINED ME MONSIEUR PONTMERCY IS THAT
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO TOUCH THAT MONEY
THAT MONEY REALLY BELONGS
TO YOUR WIFE
I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU MY CHILDREN AND FOR THAT REASON
ALSO I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU
BLACK JET COMES FROM ENGLAND WHITE JET
COMES FROM NORWAY
ALL THIS IS IN THIS PAPER WHICH YOU WILL READ
FOR
BRACELETS I INVENTED A WAY OF SUBSTITUTING FOR SLIDES OF SOLDERED SHEET
IRON SLIDES OF IRON LAID TOGETHER
IT IS PRETTIER BETTER AND LESS
COSTLY
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MONEY CAN BE MADE IN THAT WAY
SO
COSETTE'S FORTUNE IS REALLY HERS
I GIVE YOU THESE DETAILS IN ORDER
THAT YOUR MIND MAY BE SET AT REST
THE PORTRESS HAD COME UPSTAIRS AND WAS GAZING IN AT THE HALF OPEN DOOR
THE DOCTOR DISMISSED HER
BUT HE COULD NOT PREVENT THIS ZEALOUS WOMAN FROM EXCLAIMING TO THE DYING
MAN BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED WOULD YOU LIKE A PRIEST
I HAVE HAD ONE REPLIED JEAN VALJEAN
AND WITH HIS FINGER HE SEEMED TO INDICATE A POINT ABOVE HIS HEAD WHERE
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE SAW SOME ONE
IT IS PROBABLE IN FACT THAT THE BISHOP WAS PRESENT AT THIS DEATH
AGONY
COSETTE GENTLY SLIPPED A PILLOW UNDER HIS LOINS
JEAN VALJEAN RESUMED
HAVE NO FEAR MONSIEUR PONTMERCY I ADJURE YOU
THE SIX HUNDRED
THOUSAND FRANCS REALLY BELONG TO COSETTE
MY LIFE WILL HAVE BEEN WASTED
IF YOU DO NOT ENJOY THEM WE MANAGED TO DO VERY WELL WITH THOSE GLASS
GOODS
WE RIVALLED WHAT IS CALLED BERLIN JEWELLERY
HOWEVER WE COULD
NOT EQUAL THE BLACK GLASS OF ENGLAND
A GROSS WHICH CONTAINS TWELVE
HUNDRED VERY WELL CUT GRAINS ONLY COSTS THREE FRANCS
WHEN A BEING WHO IS DEAR TO US IS ON THE POINT OF DEATH WE GAZE UPON
HIM WITH A LOOK WHICH CLINGS CONVULSIVELY TO HIM AND WHICH WOULD FAIN
HOLD HIM BACK
COSETTE GAVE HER HAND TO MARIUS AND BOTH MUTE WITH ANGUISH NOT
KNOWING WHAT TO SAY TO THE DYING MAN STOOD TREMBLING AND DESPAIRING
BEFORE HIM
JEAN VALJEAN SANK MOMENT BY MOMENT
HE WAS FAILING HE WAS DRAWING NEAR
TO THE GLOOMY HORIZON
HIS BREATH HAD BECOME INTERMITTENT A LITTLE RATTLING INTERRUPTED IT
HE FOUND SOME DIFFICULTY IN MOVING HIS FOREARM HIS FEET HAD LOST ALL
MOVEMENT AND IN PROPORTION AS THE WRETCHEDNESS OF LIMB AND FEEBLENESS
OF BODY INCREASED ALL THE MAJESTY OF HIS SOUL WAS DISPLAYED AND SPREAD
OVER HIS BROW
THE LIGHT OF THE UNKNOWN WORLD WAS ALREADY VISIBLE IN HIS
EYES
HIS FACE PALED AND SMILED
LIFE WAS NO LONGER THERE IT WAS SOMETHING
ELSE
HIS BREATH SANK HIS GLANCE GREW GRANDER
HE WAS A CORPSE ON WHICH THE
WINGS COULD BE FELT
HE MADE A SIGN TO COSETTE TO DRAW NEAR THEN TO MARIUS THE LAST MINUTE
OF THE LAST HOUR HAD EVIDENTLY ARRIVED
HE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO THEM IN A VOICE SO FEEBLE THAT IT SEEMED TO COME
FROM A DISTANCE AND ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT A WALL NOW ROSE BETWEEN
THEM AND HIM
DRAW NEAR DRAW NEAR BOTH OF YOU
I LOVE YOU DEARLY
OH HOW GOOD IT
IS TO DIE LIKE THIS AND THOU LOVEST ME ALSO MY COSETTE
I KNEW WELL
THAT THOU STILL FELT FRIENDLY TOWARDS THY POOR OLD MAN
HOW KIND IT WAS
OF THEE TO PLACE THAT PILLOW UNDER MY LOINS THOU WILT WEEP FOR ME A
LITTLE WILT THOU NOT NOT TOO MUCH
I DO NOT WISH THEE TO HAVE ANY REAL
GRIEFS
YOU MUST ENJOY YOURSELVES A GREAT DEAL MY CHILDREN
I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU THAT THE PROFIT WAS GREATER STILL ON THE BUCKLES WITHOUT
TONGUES THAN ON ALL THE REST
A GROSS OF A DOZEN DOZENS COST TEN FRANCS
AND SOLD FOR SIXTY
IT REALLY WAS A GOOD BUSINESS
SO THERE IS NO
OCCASION FOR SURPRISE AT THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS MONSIEUR
PONTMERCY
IT IS HONEST MONEY
YOU MAY BE RICH WITH A TRANQUIL MIND
THOU MUST HAVE A CARRIAGE A BOX AT THE THEATRES NOW AND THEN AND
HANDSOME BALL DRESSES MY COSETTE AND THEN THOU MUST GIVE GOOD DINNERS
TO THY FRIENDS AND BE VERY HAPPY
I WAS WRITING TO COSETTE A WHILE AGO
SHE WILL FIND MY LETTER
I BEQUEATH TO HER THE TWO CANDLESTICKS WHICH
STAND ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
THEY ARE OF SILVER BUT TO ME THEY ARE GOLD
THEY ARE DIAMONDS THEY CHANGE CANDLES WHICH ARE PLACED IN THEM INTO
WAX TAPERS
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE PERSON WHO GAVE THEM TO ME IS
PLEASED WITH ME YONDER ON HIGH
I HAVE DONE WHAT I COULD
MY CHILDREN
YOU WILL NOT FORGET THAT I AM A POOR MAN YOU WILL HAVE ME BURIED IN THE
FIRST PLOT OF EARTH THAT YOU FIND UNDER A STONE TO MARK THE SPOT
THIS
IS MY WISH
NO NAME ON THE STONE
IF COSETTE CARES TO COME FOR A LITTLE
WHILE NOW AND THEN IT WILL GIVE ME PLEASURE
AND YOU TOO MONSIEUR
PONTMERCY
I MUST ADMIT THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS LOVED YOU
I ASK YOUR
PARDON FOR THAT
NOW SHE AND YOU FORM BUT ONE FOR ME
I FEEL VERY
GRATEFUL TO YOU
I AM SURE THAT YOU MAKE COSETTE HAPPY
IF YOU ONLY
KNEW MONSIEUR PONTMERCY HER PRETTY ROSY CHEEKS WERE MY DELIGHT WHEN I
SAW HER IN THE LEAST PALE I WAS SAD
IN THE CHEST OF DRAWERS THERE IS
A BANK BILL FOR FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
I HAVE NOT TOUCHED IT
IT IS FOR
THE POOR
COSETTE DOST THOU SEE THY LITTLE GOWN YONDER ON THE BED DOST
THOU RECOGNIZE IT THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO HOWEVER
HOW TIME FLIES WE
HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY
ALL IS OVER
DO NOT WEEP MY CHILDREN I AM NOT
GOING VERY FAR I SHALL SEE YOU FROM THERE YOU WILL ONLY HAVE TO
LOOK AT NIGHT AND YOU WILL SEE ME SMILE
COSETTE DOST THOU REMEMBER
MONTFERMEIL THOU WERT IN THE FOREST THOU WERT GREATLY TERRIFIED DOST
THOU REMEMBER HOW I TOOK HOLD OF THE HANDLE OF THE WATER BUCKET THAT
WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I TOUCHED THY POOR LITTLE HAND
IT WAS SO COLD
AH YOUR HANDS WERE RED THEN MADEMOISELLE THEY ARE VERY WHITE NOW
AND
THE BIG DOLL DOST THOU REMEMBER THOU DIDST CALL HER CATHERINE
THOU
REGRETTEDEST NOT HAVING TAKEN HER TO THE CONVENT HOW THOU DIDST MAKE
ME LAUGH SOMETIMES MY SWEET ANGEL WHEN IT HAD BEEN RAINING THOU DIDST
FLOAT BITS OF STRAW ON THE GUTTERS AND WATCH THEM PASS AWAY
ONE DAY
I GAVE THEE A WILLOW BATTLEDORE AND A SHUTTLECOCK WITH YELLOW BLUE AND
GREEN FEATHERS
THOU HAST FORGOTTEN IT
THOU WERT ROGUISH SO YOUNG THOU
DIDST PLAY
THOU DIDST PUT CHERRIES IN THY EARS
THOSE ARE THINGS OF
THE PAST
THE FORESTS THROUGH WHICH ONE HAS PASSED WITH ONE'S CHILD THE
TREES UNDER WHICH ONE HAS STROLLED THE CONVENTS WHERE ONE HAS CONCEALED
ONESELF THE GAMES THE HEARTY LAUGHS OF CHILDHOOD ARE SHADOWS
I
IMAGINED THAT ALL THAT BELONGED TO ME
IN THAT LAY MY STUPIDITY
THOSE
THENARDIERS WERE WICKED
THOU MUST FORGIVE THEM
COSETTE THE MOMENT
HAS COME TO TELL THEE THE NAME OF THY MOTHER
SHE WAS CALLED FANTINE
REMEMBER THAT NAME FANTINE
KNEEL WHENEVER THOU UTTEREST IT
SHE
SUFFERED MUCH
SHE LOVED THEE DEARLY
SHE HAD AS MUCH UNHAPPINESS AS
THOU HAST HAD HAPPINESS
THAT IS THE WAY GOD APPORTIONS THINGS
HE IS
THERE ON HIGH HE SEES US ALL AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE DOES IN THE MIDST OF
HIS GREAT STARS
I AM ON THE VERGE OF DEPARTURE MY CHILDREN
LOVE EACH
OTHER WELL AND ALWAYS
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BUT THAT IN THE WORLD LOVE
FOR EACH OTHER
YOU WILL THINK SOMETIMES OF THE POOR OLD MAN WHO DIED
HERE
OH MY COSETTE IT IS NOT MY FAULT INDEED THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN
THEE ALL THIS TIME IT CUT ME TO THE HEART I WENT AS FAR AS THE CORNER
OF THE STREET I MUST HAVE PRODUCED A QUEER EFFECT ON THE PEOPLE WHO
SAW ME PASS I WAS LIKE A MADMAN I ONCE WENT OUT WITHOUT MY HAT

LONGER SEE CLEARLY MY CHILDREN I HAD STILL OTHER THINGS TO SAY BUT
NEVER MIND
THINK A LITTLE OF ME

GIVE
ME YOUR DEAR AND WELL BELOVED HEADS SO THAT I MAY LAY MY HANDS UPON
THEM
COSETTE AND MARIUS FELL ON THEIR KNEES IN DESPAIR SUFFOCATING WITH
TEARS EACH BENEATH ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S HANDS
THOSE AUGUST HANDS NO
LONGER MOVED
HE HAD FALLEN BACKWARDS THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLES ILLUMINATED HIM
HIS WHITE FACE LOOKED UP TO HEAVEN HE ALLOWED COSETTE AND MARIUS TO
COVER HIS HANDS WITH KISSES
HE WAS DEAD
THE NIGHT WAS STARLESS AND EXTREMELY DARK
NO DOUBT IN THE GLOOM SOME
IMMENSE ANGEL STOOD ERECT WITH WINGS OUTSPREAD AWAITING THAT SOUL

FAR FROM THE ELEGANT QUARTER OF THAT CITY OF SEPULCHRES FAR FROM ALL
THE TOMBS OF FANCY WHICH DISPLAY IN THE PRESENCE OF ETERNITY ALL THE
HIDEOUS FASHIONS OF DEATH IN A DESERTED CORNER BESIDE AN OLD WALL
BENEATH A GREAT YEW TREE OVER WHICH CLIMBS THE WILD CONVOLVULUS AMID
DANDELIONS AND MOSSES THERE LIES A STONE
THAT STONE IS NO MORE EXEMPT
THAN OTHERS FROM THE LEPROSY OF TIME OF DAMPNESS OF THE LICHENS AND
FROM THE DEFILEMENT OF THE BIRDS
THE WATER TURNS IT GREEN THE AIR
BLACKENS IT
IT IS NOT NEAR ANY PATH AND PEOPLE ARE NOT FOND OF
WALKING IN THAT DIRECTION BECAUSE THE GRASS IS HIGH AND THEIR FEET
ARE IMMEDIATELY WET
WHEN THERE IS A LITTLE SUNSHINE THE LIZARDS
COME THITHER
ALL AROUND THERE IS A QUIVERING OF WEEDS
IN THE SPRING
LINNETS WARBLE IN THE TREES
THIS STONE IS PERFECTLY PLAIN
IN CUTTING IT THE ONLY THOUGHT WAS THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THE TOMB AND NO OTHER CARE WAS TAKEN THAN TO MAKE THE
STONE LONG ENOUGH AND NARROW ENOUGH TO COVER A MAN
NO NAME IS TO BE READ THERE
ONLY MANY YEARS AGO A HAND WROTE UPON IT IN PENCIL THESE FOUR LINES

LETTER TO M
DAELLI
PUBLISHER OF THE ITALIAN TRANSLATION OF LES MISERABLES IN MILAN
HAUTEVILLE HOUSE OCTOBER 18 1862
YOU ARE RIGHT SIR WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT LES MISERABLES IS WRITTEN FOR
ALL NATIONS
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT WILL BE READ BY ALL BUT I WROTE
IT FOR ALL
IT IS ADDRESSED TO ENGLAND AS WELL AS TO SPAIN TO ITALY AS
WELL AS TO FRANCE TO GERMANY AS WELL AS TO IRELAND TO REPUBLICS WHICH
HAVE SLAVES AS WELL AS TO EMPIRES WHICH HAVE SERFS
SOCIAL PROBLEMS
OVERSTEP FRONTIERS
THE SORES OF THE HUMAN RACE THOSE GREAT SORES WHICH
COVER THE GLOBE DO NOT HALT AT THE RED OR BLUE LINES TRACED UPON THE
MAP
IN EVERY PLACE WHERE MAN IS IGNORANT AND DESPAIRING IN EVERY PLACE
WHERE WOMAN IS SOLD FOR BREAD WHEREVER THE CHILD SUFFERS FOR LACK OF
THE BOOK WHICH SHOULD INSTRUCT HIM AND OF THE HEARTH WHICH SHOULD WARM
HIM THE BOOK OF LES MISERABLES KNOCKS AT THE DOOR AND SAYS OPEN TO
ME I COME FOR YOU
AT THE HOUR OF CIVILIZATION THROUGH WHICH WE ARE NOW PASSING AND WHICH
IS STILL SO SOMBRE THE MISERABLE'S NAME IS MAN HE IS AGONIZING IN ALL
CLIMES AND HE IS GROANING IN ALL LANGUAGES
YOUR ITALY IS NO MORE EXEMPT FROM THE EVIL THAN IS OUR FRANCE
YOUR
ADMIRABLE ITALY HAS ALL MISERIES ON THE FACE OF IT
DOES NOT BANDITISM
THAT RAGING FORM OF PAUPERISM INHABIT YOUR MOUNTAINS FEW NATIONS ARE
MORE DEEPLY EATEN BY THAT ULCER OF CONVENTS WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO
FATHOM
IN SPITE OF YOUR POSSESSING ROME MILAN NAPLES PALERMO TURIN
FLORENCE SIENNA PISA MANTUA BOLOGNA FERRARA GENOA VENICE A
HEROIC HISTORY SUBLIME RUINS MAGNIFICENT RUINS AND SUPERB CITIES
YOU ARE LIKE OURSELVES POOR
YOU ARE COVERED WITH MARVELS AND VERMIN
ASSUREDLY THE SUN OF ITALY IS SPLENDID BUT ALAS AZURE IN THE SKY
DOES NOT PREVENT RAGS ON MAN
LIKE US YOU HAVE PREJUDICES SUPERSTITIONS TYRANNIES FANATICISMS
BLIND LAWS LENDING ASSISTANCE TO IGNORANT CUSTOMS
YOU TASTE NOTHING OF
THE PRESENT NOR OF THE FUTURE WITHOUT A FLAVOR OF THE PAST BEING MINGLED
WITH IT
YOU HAVE A BARBARIAN THE MONK AND A SAVAGE THE LAZZARONE
THE SOCIAL QUESTION IS THE SAME FOR YOU AS FOR US
THERE ARE A FEW LESS
DEATHS FROM HUNGER WITH YOU AND A FEW MORE FROM FEVER YOUR SOCIAL
HYGIENE IS NOT MUCH BETTER THAN OURS SHADOWS WHICH ARE PROTESTANT IN
ENGLAND ARE CATHOLIC IN ITALY BUT UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES THE VESCOVO
IS IDENTICAL WITH THE BISHOP AND IT ALWAYS MEANS NIGHT AND OF PRETTY
NEARLY THE SAME QUALITY
TO EXPLAIN THE BIBLE BADLY AMOUNTS TO THE SAME
THING AS TO UNDERSTAND THE GOSPEL BADLY
IS IT NECESSARY TO EMPHASIZE THIS MUST THIS MELANCHOLY PARALLELISM
BE YET MORE COMPLETELY VERIFIED HAVE YOU NOT INDIGENT PERSONS GLANCE
BELOW
HAVE YOU NOT PARASITES GLANCE UP
DOES NOT THAT HIDEOUS BALANCE
WHOSE TWO SCALES PAUPERISM AND PARASITISM SO MOURNFULLY PRESERVE THEIR
MUTUAL EQUILIBRIUM OSCILLATE BEFORE YOU AS IT DOES BEFORE US WHERE
IS YOUR ARMY OF SCHOOLMASTERS THE ONLY ARMY WHICH CIVILIZATION
ACKNOWLEDGES
WHERE ARE YOUR FREE AND COMPULSORY SCHOOLS DOES EVERY ONE KNOW HOW TO
READ IN THE LAND OF DANTE AND OF MICHAEL ANGELO HAVE YOU MADE PUBLIC
SCHOOLS OF YOUR BARRACKS HAVE YOU NOT LIKE OURSELVES AN OPULENT
WAR BUDGET AND A PALTRY BUDGET OF EDUCATION HAVE NOT YOU ALSO THAT
PASSIVE OBEDIENCE WHICH IS SO EASILY CONVERTED INTO SOLDIERLY OBEDIENCE
MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT WHICH PUSHES THE REGULATIONS TO THE EXTREME OF
FIRING UPON GARIBALDI THAT IS TO SAY UPON THE LIVING HONOR OF ITALY
LET US SUBJECT YOUR SOCIAL ORDER TO EXAMINATION LET US TAKE IT WHERE IT
STANDS AND AS IT STANDS LET US VIEW ITS FLAGRANT OFFENCES SHOW ME THE
WOMAN AND THE CHILD
IT IS BY THE AMOUNT OF PROTECTION WITH WHICH THESE
TWO FEEBLE CREATURES ARE SURROUNDED THAT THE DEGREE OF CIVILIZATION
IS TO BE MEASURED
IS PROSTITUTION LESS HEARTRENDING IN NAPLES THAN IN
PARIS WHAT IS THE AMOUNT OF TRUTH THAT SPRINGS FROM YOUR LAWS AND WHAT
AMOUNT OF JUSTICE SPRINGS FROM YOUR TRIBUNALS DO YOU CHANCE TO BE SO
FORTUNATE AS TO BE IGNORANT OF THE MEANING OF THOSE GLOOMY WORDS PUBLIC
PROSECUTION LEGAL INFAMY PRISON THE SCAFFOLD THE EXECUTIONER THE
DEATH PENALTY ITALIANS WITH YOU AS WITH US BECCARIA IS DEAD AND
FARINACE IS ALIVE
AND THEN LET US SCRUTINIZE YOUR STATE REASONS
HAVE YOU A GOVERNMENT WHICH COMPREHENDS THE IDENTITY OF MORALITY AND
POLITICS YOU HAVE REACHED THE POINT WHERE YOU GRANT AMNESTY TO HEROES
SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR HAS BEEN DONE IN FRANCE
STAY LET US PASS
MISERIES IN REVIEW LET EACH ONE CONTRIBUTE HIS PILE YOU ARE AS RICH
AS WE
HAVE YOU NOT LIKE OURSELVES TWO CONDEMNATIONS RELIGIOUS
CONDEMNATION PRONOUNCED BY THE PRIEST AND SOCIAL CONDEMNATION DECREED
BY THE JUDGE OH GREAT NATION OF ITALY THOU RESEMBLEST THE GREAT
NATION OF FRANCE ALAS OUR BROTHERS YOU ARE LIKE OURSELVES
MISERABLES
FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE GLOOM WHEREIN YOU DWELL YOU DO NOT SEE MUCH MORE
DISTINCTLY THAN WE THE RADIANT AND DISTANT PORTALS OF EDEN
ONLY THE
PRIESTS ARE MISTAKEN
THESE HOLY PORTALS ARE BEFORE AND NOT BEHIND US
I RESUME
THIS BOOK LES MISERABLES IS NO LESS YOUR MIRROR THAN OURS
CERTAIN MEN CERTAIN CASTES RISE IN REVOLT AGAINST THIS BOOK I
UNDERSTAND THAT
MIRRORS THOSE REVEALERS OF THE TRUTH ARE HATED THAT
DOES NOT PREVENT THEM FROM BEING OF USE
AS FOR MYSELF I HAVE WRITTEN FOR ALL WITH A PROFOUND LOVE FOR MY OWN
COUNTRY BUT WITHOUT BEING ENGROSSED BY FRANCE MORE THAN BY ANY OTHER
NATION
IN PROPORTION AS I ADVANCE IN LIFE I GROW MORE SIMPLE AND I
BECOME MORE AND MORE PATRIOTIC FOR HUMANITY
THIS IS MOREOVER THE TENDENCY OF OUR AGE AND THE LAW OF RADIANCE
OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION BOOKS MUST CEASE TO BE EXCLUSIVELY FRENCH
ITALIAN GERMAN SPANISH OR ENGLISH AND BECOME EUROPEAN I SAY MORE
HUMAN IF THEY ARE TO CORRESPOND TO THE ENLARGEMENT OF CIVILIZATION
HENCE A NEW LOGIC OF ART AND OF CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS OF COMPOSITION
WHICH MODIFY EVERYTHING EVEN THE CONDITIONS FORMERLY NARROW OF TASTE
AND LANGUAGE WHICH MUST GROW BROADER LIKE ALL THE REST
IN FRANCE CERTAIN CRITICS HAVE REPROACHED ME TO MY GREAT DELIGHT
WITH HAVING TRANSGRESSED THE BOUNDS OF WHAT THEY CALL FRENCH TASTE I
SHOULD BE GLAD IF THIS EULOGIUM WERE MERITED
IN SHORT I AM DOING WHAT I CAN I SUFFER WITH THE SAME UNIVERSAL
SUFFERING AND I TRY TO ASSUAGE IT I POSSESS ONLY THE PUNY FORCES OF A
MAN AND I CRY TO ALL HELP ME
THIS SIR IS WHAT YOUR LETTER PROMPTS ME TO SAY I SAY IT FOR YOU AND
FOR YOUR COUNTRY
IF I HAVE INSISTED SO STRONGLY IT IS BECAUSE OF ONE
PHRASE IN YOUR LETTER
YOU WRITE
THERE ARE ITALIANS AND THEY ARE NUMEROUS WHO SAY 'THIS BOOK LES
MISERABLES IS A FRENCH BOOK
IT DOES NOT CONCERN US
LET THE FRENCH
READ IT AS A HISTORY WE READ IT AS A ROMANCE ALAS I REPEAT
WHETHER WE BE ITALIANS OR FRENCHMEN MISERY CONCERNS US ALL
EVER SINCE
HISTORY HAS BEEN WRITTEN EVER SINCE PHILOSOPHY HAS MEDITATED MISERY
HAS BEEN THE GARMENT OF THE HUMAN RACE THE MOMENT HAS AT LENGTH ARRIVED
FOR TEARING OFF THAT RAG AND FOR REPLACING UPON THE NAKED LIMBS OF THE
MAN PEOPLE THE SINISTER FRAGMENT OF THE PAST WITH THE GRAND PURPLE ROBE
OF THE DAWN
IF THIS LETTER SEEMS TO YOU OF SERVICE IN ENLIGHTENING SOME MINDS AND
IN DISSIPATING SOME PREJUDICES YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO PUBLISH IT
SIR
ACCEPT I PRAY YOU A RENEWED ASSURANCE OF MY VERY DISTINGUISHED
SENTIMENTS
VICTOR HUGO

PREFACE
A FEW YEARS AGO WHILE VISITING OR RATHER RUMMAGING ABOUT NOTRE DAME
THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK FOUND IN AN OBSCURE NOOK OF ONE OF THE TOWERS
THE FOLLOWING WORD ENGRAVED BY HAND UPON THE WALL
ANARKH
THESE GREEK CAPITALS BLACK WITH AGE AND QUITE DEEPLY GRAVEN IN
THE STONE WITH I KNOW NOT WHAT SIGNS PECULIAR TO GOTHIC CALIGRAPHY
IMPRINTED UPON THEIR FORMS AND UPON THEIR ATTITUDES AS THOUGH WITH THE
PURPOSE OF REVEALING THAT IT HAD BEEN A HAND OF THE MIDDLE AGES WHICH
HAD INSCRIBED THEM THERE AND ESPECIALLY THE FATAL AND MELANCHOLY
MEANING CONTAINED IN THEM STRUCK THE AUTHOR DEEPLY
HE QUESTIONED HIMSELF HE SOUGHT TO DIVINE WHO COULD HAVE BEEN THAT SOUL
IN TORMENT WHICH HAD NOT BEEN WILLING TO QUIT THIS WORLD WITHOUT LEAVING
THIS STIGMA OF CRIME OR UNHAPPINESS UPON THE BROW OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH
AFTERWARDS THE WALL WAS WHITEWASHED OR SCRAPED DOWN I KNOW NOT WHICH
AND THE INSCRIPTION DISAPPEARED
FOR IT IS THUS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN
THE HABIT OF PROCEEDING WITH THE MARVELLOUS CHURCHES OF THE MIDDLE AGES
FOR THE LAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS
MUTILATIONS COME TO THEM FROM EVERY
QUARTER FROM WITHIN AS WELL AS FROM WITHOUT
THE PRIEST WHITEWASHES
THEM THE ARCHDEACON SCRAPES THEM DOWN THEN THE POPULACE ARRIVES AND
DEMOLISHES THEM
THUS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FRAGILE MEMORY WHICH THE AUTHOR OF THIS
BOOK HERE CONSECRATES TO IT THERE REMAINS TO DAY NOTHING WHATEVER
OF THE MYSTERIOUS WORD ENGRAVED WITHIN THE GLOOMY TOWER OF
NOTRE DAME NOTHING OF THE DESTINY WHICH IT SO SADLY SUMMED UP
THE
MAN WHO WROTE THAT WORD UPON THE WALL DISAPPEARED FROM THE MIDST OF THE
GENERATIONS OF MAN MANY CENTURIES AGO THE WORD IN ITS TURN HAS BEEN
EFFACED FROM THE WALL OF THE CHURCH THE CHURCH WILL PERHAPS ITSELF
SOON DISAPPEAR FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH
IT IS UPON THIS WORD THAT THIS BOOK IS FOUNDED

CHAPTER I
THE GRAND HALL
THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT YEARS SIX MONTHS AND NINETEEN DAYS AGO
TO DAY THE PARISIANS AWOKE TO THE SOUND OF ALL THE BELLS IN THE TRIPLE
CIRCUIT OF THE CITY THE UNIVERSITY AND THE TOWN RINGING A FULL PEAL
THE SIXTH OF JANUARY 1482 IS NOT HOWEVER A DAY OF WHICH HISTORY HAS
PRESERVED THE MEMORY
THERE WAS NOTHING NOTABLE IN THE EVENT WHICH
THUS SET THE BELLS AND THE BOURGEOIS OF PARIS IN A FERMENT FROM EARLY
MORNING
IT WAS NEITHER AN ASSAULT BY THE PICARDS NOR THE BURGUNDIANS
NOR A HUNT LED ALONG IN PROCESSION NOR A REVOLT OF SCHOLARS IN THE TOWN
OF LAAS NOR AN ENTRY OF OUR MUCH DREAD LORD MONSIEUR THE KING NOR
EVEN A PRETTY HANGING OF MALE AND FEMALE THIEVES BY THE COURTS OF PARIS
NEITHER WAS IT THE ARRIVAL SO FREQUENT IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY OF
SOME PLUMED AND BEDIZENED EMBASSY
IT WAS BARELY TWO DAYS SINCE THE LAST
CAVALCADE OF THAT NATURE THAT OF THE FLEMISH AMBASSADORS CHARGED WITH
CONCLUDING THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE DAUPHIN AND MARGUERITE OF FLANDERS
HAD MADE ITS ENTRY INTO PARIS TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF M
LE CARDINAL
DE BOURBON WHO FOR THE SAKE OF PLEASING THE KING HAD BEEN OBLIGED
TO ASSUME AN AMIABLE MIEN TOWARDS THIS WHOLE RUSTIC RABBLE OF FLEMISH
BURGOMASTERS AND TO REGALE THEM AT HIS HTEL DE BOURBON WITH A VERY
PRETTY MORALITY ALLEGORICAL SATIRE AND FARCE WHILE A DRIVING RAIN
DRENCHED THE MAGNIFICENT TAPESTRIES AT HIS DOOR
WHAT PUT THE WHOLE POPULATION OF PARIS IN COMMOTION AS JEHAN DE
TROYES EXPRESSES IT ON THE SIXTH OF JANUARY WAS THE DOUBLE SOLEMNITY
UNITED FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL OF THE EPIPHANY AND THE FEAST OF FOOLS
ON THAT DAY THERE WAS TO BE A BONFIRE ON THE PLACE DE GRVE A MAYPOLE
AT THE CHAPELLE DE BRAQUE AND A MYSTERY AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE
IT
HAD BEEN CRIED TO THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET THE PRECEDING EVENING AT
ALL THE CROSS ROADS BY THE PROVOST'S MEN CLAD IN HANDSOME SHORT
SLEEVELESS COATS OF VIOLET CAMELOT WITH LARGE WHITE CROSSES UPON THEIR
BREASTS
SO THE CROWD OF CITIZENS MALE AND FEMALE HAVING CLOSED THEIR HOUSES
AND SHOPS THRONGED FROM EVERY DIRECTION AT EARLY MORN TOWARDS SOME
ONE OF THE THREE SPOTS DESIGNATED
EACH HAD MADE HIS CHOICE ONE THE BONFIRE ANOTHER THE MAYPOLE
ANOTHER THE MYSTERY PLAY
IT MUST BE STATED IN HONOR OF THE GOOD SENSE
OF THE LOUNGERS OF PARIS THAT THE GREATER PART OF THIS CROWD DIRECTED
THEIR STEPS TOWARDS THE BONFIRE WHICH WAS QUITE IN SEASON OR TOWARDS
THE MYSTERY PLAY WHICH WAS TO BE PRESENTED IN THE GRAND HALL OF THE
PALAIS DE JUSTICE THE COURTS OF LAW WHICH WAS WELL ROOFED AND WALLED
AND THAT THE CURIOUS LEFT THE POOR SCANTILY FLOWERED MAYPOLE TO SHIVER
ALL ALONE BENEATH THE SKY OF JANUARY IN THE CEMETERY OF THE CHAPEL OF
BRAQUE
THE POPULACE THRONGED THE AVENUES OF THE LAW COURTS IN PARTICULAR
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT THE FLEMISH AMBASSADORS WHO HAD ARRIVED TWO DAYS
PREVIOUSLY INTENDED TO BE PRESENT AT THE REPRESENTATION OF THE MYSTERY
AND AT THE ELECTION OF THE POPE OF THE FOOLS WHICH WAS ALSO TO TAKE
PLACE IN THE GRAND HALL
IT WAS NO EASY MATTER ON THAT DAY TO FORCE ONE'S WAY INTO THAT GRAND
HALL ALTHOUGH IT WAS THEN REPUTED TO BE THE LARGEST COVERED ENCLOSURE
IN THE WORLD IT IS TRUE THAT SAUVAL HAD NOT YET MEASURED THE GRAND HALL
OF THE CHTEAU OF MONTARGIS
THE PALACE PLACE ENCUMBERED WITH PEOPLE
OFFERED TO THE CURIOUS GAZERS AT THE WINDOWS THE ASPECT OF A SEA INTO
WHICH FIVE OR SIX STREETS LIKE SO MANY MOUTHS OF RIVERS DISCHARGED
EVERY MOMENT FRESH FLOODS OF HEADS
THE WAVES OF THIS CROWD AUGMENTED
INCESSANTLY DASHED AGAINST THE ANGLES OF THE HOUSES WHICH PROJECTED
HERE AND THERE LIKE SO MANY PROMONTORIES INTO THE IRREGULAR BASIN OF
THE PLACE
IN THE CENTRE OF THE LOFTY GOTHIC FAADE OF THE PALACE THE
GRAND STAIRCASE INCESSANTLY ASCENDED AND DESCENDED BY A DOUBLE CURRENT
WHICH AFTER PARTING ON THE INTERMEDIATE LANDING PLACE FLOWED IN BROAD
WAVES ALONG ITS LATERAL SLOPES THE GRAND STAIRCASE I SAY TRICKLED
INCESSANTLY INTO THE PLACE LIKE A CASCADE INTO A LAKE
THE CRIES THE
LAUGHTER THE TRAMPLING OF THOSE THOUSANDS OF FEET PRODUCED A GREAT
NOISE AND A GREAT CLAMOR
FROM TIME TO TIME THIS NOISE AND CLAMOR
REDOUBLED THE CURRENT WHICH DROVE THE CROWD TOWARDS THE GRAND STAIRCASE
FLOWED BACKWARDS BECAME TROUBLED FORMED WHIRLPOOLS
THIS WAS PRODUCED
BY THE BUFFET OF AN ARCHER OR THE HORSE OF ONE OF THE PROVOST'S
SERGEANTS WHICH KICKED TO RESTORE ORDER AN ADMIRABLE TRADITION WHICH
THE PROVOSTSHIP HAS BEQUEATHED TO THE CONSTABLERY THE CONSTABLERY TO
THE MARCHAUSSE THE MARCHAUSSE TO OUR GENDARMERI OF PARIS
THE WORD GOTHIC IN THE SENSE IN WHICH IT IS GENERALLY EMPLOYED
IS WHOLLY UNSUITABLE BUT WHOLLY CONSECRATED
HENCE WE ACCEPT IT AND
WE ADOPT IT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD TO CHARACTERIZE THE
ARCHITECTURE OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE MIDDLE AGES WHERE THE OGIVE IS
THE PRINCIPLE WHICH SUCCEEDS THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE FIRST PERIOD OF
WHICH THE SEMI CIRCLE IS THE FATHER
THOUSANDS OF GOOD CALM BOURGEOIS FACES THRONGED THE WINDOWS THE
DOORS THE DORMER WINDOWS THE ROOFS GAZING AT THE PALACE GAZING
AT THE POPULACE AND ASKING NOTHING MORE FOR MANY PARISIANS CONTENT
THEMSELVES WITH THE SPECTACLE OF THE SPECTATORS AND A WALL BEHIND WHICH
SOMETHING IS GOING ON BECOMES AT ONCE FOR US A VERY CURIOUS THING
INDEED
IF IT COULD BE GRANTED TO US THE MEN OF 1830 TO MINGLE IN THOUGHT
WITH THOSE PARISIANS OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND TO ENTER WITH THEM
JOSTLED ELBOWED PULLED ABOUT INTO THAT IMMENSE HALL OF THE PALACE
WHICH WAS SO CRAMPED ON THAT SIXTH OF JANUARY 1482 THE SPECTACLE WOULD
NOT BE DEVOID OF EITHER INTEREST OR CHARM AND WE SHOULD HAVE ABOUT US
ONLY THINGS THAT WERE SO OLD THAT THEY WOULD SEEM NEW
WITH THE READER'S CONSENT WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO RETRACE IN THOUGHT
THE IMPRESSION WHICH HE WOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED IN COMPANY WITH US
ON CROSSING THE THRESHOLD OF THAT GRAND HALL IN THE MIDST OF THAT
TUMULTUOUS CROWD IN SURCOATS SHORT SLEEVELESS JACKETS AND DOUBLETS
AND FIRST OF ALL THERE IS A BUZZING IN THE EARS A DAZZLEMENT IN
THE EYES
ABOVE OUR HEADS IS A DOUBLE OGIVE VAULT PANELLED WITH WOOD
CARVING PAINTED AZURE AND SOWN WITH GOLDEN FLEURS DE LIS BENEATH
OUR FEET A PAVEMENT OF BLACK AND WHITE MARBLE ALTERNATING
A FEW PACES
DISTANT AN ENORMOUS PILLAR THEN ANOTHER THEN ANOTHER SEVEN PILLARS
IN ALL DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE HALL SUSTAINING THE SPRING OF THE ARCHES
OF THE DOUBLE VAULT IN THE CENTRE OF ITS WIDTH
AROUND FOUR OF THE
PILLARS STALLS OF MERCHANTS ALL SPARKLING WITH GLASS AND TINSEL
AROUND THE LAST THREE BENCHES OF OAK WORN AND POLISHED BY THE TRUNK
HOSE OF THE LITIGANTS AND THE ROBES OF THE ATTORNEYS
AROUND THE HALL
ALONG THE LOFTY WALL BETWEEN THE DOORS BETWEEN THE WINDOWS BETWEEN
THE PILLARS THE INTERMINABLE ROW OF ALL THE KINGS OF FRANCE FROM
PHARAMOND DOWN THE LAZY KINGS WITH PENDENT ARMS AND DOWNCAST EYES
THE VALIANT AND COMBATIVE KINGS WITH HEADS AND ARMS RAISED BOLDLY
HEAVENWARD
THEN IN THE LONG POINTED WINDOWS GLASS OF A THOUSAND HUES
AT THE WIDE ENTRANCES TO THE HALL RICH DOORS FINELY SCULPTURED AND
ALL THE VAULTS PILLARS WALLS JAMBS PANELLING DOORS STATUES
COVERED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WITH A SPLENDID BLUE AND GOLD ILLUMINATION
WHICH A TRIFLE TARNISHED AT THE EPOCH WHEN WE BEHOLD IT HAD ALMOST
ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED BENEATH DUST AND SPIDERS IN THE YEAR OF GRACE
1549 WHEN DU BREUL STILL ADMIRED IT FROM TRADITION
LET THE READER PICTURE TO HIMSELF NOW THIS IMMENSE OBLONG HALL
ILLUMINATED BY THE PALLID LIGHT OF A JANUARY DAY INVADED BY A MOTLEY
AND NOISY THRONG WHICH DRIFTS ALONG THE WALLS AND EDDIES ROUND THE
SEVEN PILLARS AND HE WILL HAVE A CONFUSED IDEA OF THE WHOLE EFFECT OF
THE PICTURE WHOSE CURIOUS DETAILS WE SHALL MAKE AN EFFORT TO INDICATE
WITH MORE PRECISION
IT IS CERTAIN THAT IF RAVAILLAC HAD NOT ASSASSINATED HENRI IV THERE
WOULD HAVE BEEN NO DOCUMENTS IN THE TRIAL OF RAVAILLAC DEPOSITED IN THE
CLERK'S OFFICE OF THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE NO ACCOMPLICES INTERESTED IN
CAUSING THE SAID DOCUMENTS TO DISAPPEAR HENCE NO INCENDIARIES OBLIGED
FOR LACK OF BETTER MEANS TO BURN THE CLERK'S OFFICE IN ORDER TO BURN
THE DOCUMENTS AND TO BURN THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE IN ORDER TO BURN THE
CLERK'S OFFICE CONSEQUENTLY IN SHORT NO CONFLAGRATION IN 1618
THE
OLD PALAIS WOULD BE STANDING STILL WITH ITS ANCIENT GRAND HALL I
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY TO THE READER GO AND LOOK AT IT AND WE SHOULD
THUS BOTH ESCAPE THE NECESSITY I OF MAKING AND HE OF READING A
DESCRIPTION OF IT SUCH AS IT IS
WHICH DEMONSTRATES A NEW TRUTH THAT
GREAT EVENTS HAVE INCALCULABLE RESULTS
IT IS TRUE THAT IT MAY BE QUITE POSSIBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT
RAVAILLAC HAD NO ACCOMPLICES AND IN THE SECOND THAT IF HE HAD ANY
THEY WERE IN NO WAY CONNECTED WITH THE FIRE OF 1618
TWO OTHER VERY
PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATIONS EXIST FIRST THE GREAT FLAMING STAR A FOOT
BROAD AND A CUBIT HIGH WHICH FELL FROM HEAVEN AS EVERY ONE KNOWS
UPON THE LAW COURTS AFTER MIDNIGHT ON THE SEVENTH OF MARCH SECOND
THOPHILE'S QUATRAIN
SURE 'TWAS BUT A SORRY GAME
WHEN AT PARIS DAME JUSTICE
THROUGH HAVING EATEN TOO MUCH SPICE
SET THE PALACE ALL AFLAME
WHATEVER MAY BE THOUGHT OF THIS TRIPLE EXPLANATION POLITICAL PHYSICAL
AND POETICAL OF THE BURNING OF THE LAW COURTS IN 1618 THE UNFORTUNATE
FACT OF THE FIRE IS CERTAIN
VERY LITTLE TO DAY REMAINS THANKS TO THIS
CATASTROPHE THANKS ABOVE ALL TO THE SUCCESSIVE RESTORATIONS WHICH
HAVE COMPLETED WHAT IT SPARED VERY LITTLE REMAINS OF THAT FIRST
DWELLING OF THE KINGS OF FRANCE OF THAT ELDER PALACE OF THE LOUVRE
ALREADY SO OLD IN THE TIME OF PHILIP THE HANDSOME THAT THEY SOUGHT
THERE FOR THE TRACES OF THE MAGNIFICENT BUILDINGS ERECTED BY KING ROBERT
AND DESCRIBED BY HELGALDUS
NEARLY EVERYTHING HAS DISAPPEARED
WHAT HAS
BECOME OF THE CHAMBER OF THE CHANCELLERY WHERE SAINT LOUIS CONSUMMATED
HIS MARRIAGE THE GARDEN WHERE HE ADMINISTERED JUSTICE CLAD IN A
COAT OF CAMELOT A SURCOAT OF LINSEY WOOLSEY WITHOUT SLEEVES AND A
SUR MANTLE OF BLACK SANDAL AS HE LAY UPON THE CARPET WITH JOINVILLE
WHERE IS THE CHAMBER OF THE EMPEROR SIGISMOND AND THAT OF CHARLES IV
THAT OF JEAN THE LANDLESS WHERE IS THE STAIRCASE FROM WHICH CHARLES
VI
PROMULGATED HIS EDICT OF PARDON THE SLAB WHERE MARCEL CUT THE
THROATS OF ROBERT DE CLERMONT AND THE MARSHAL OF CHAMPAGNE IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE DAUPHIN THE WICKET WHERE THE BULLS OF POPE BENEDICT
WERE TORN AND WHENCE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT THEM DEPARTED DECKED OUT IN
DERISION IN COPES AND MITRES AND MAKING AN APOLOGY THROUGH ALL PARIS
AND THE GRAND HALL WITH ITS GILDING ITS AZURE ITS STATUES ITS
POINTED ARCHES ITS PILLARS ITS IMMENSE VAULT ALL FRETTED WITH
CARVINGS AND THE GILDED CHAMBER AND THE STONE LION WHICH STOOD AT THE
DOOR WITH LOWERED HEAD AND TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS LIKE THE LIONS ON THE
THRONE OF SOLOMON IN THE HUMILIATED ATTITUDE WHICH BEFITS FORCE IN THE
PRESENCE OF JUSTICE AND THE BEAUTIFUL DOORS AND THE STAINED GLASS
AND THE CHASED IRONWORK WHICH DROVE BISCORNETTE TO DESPAIR AND THE
DELICATE WOODWORK OF HANCY WHAT HAS TIME WHAT HAVE MEN DONE WITH THESE
MARVELS WHAT HAVE THEY GIVEN US IN RETURN FOR ALL THIS GALLIC HISTORY
FOR ALL THIS GOTHIC ART THE HEAVY FLATTENED ARCHES OF M
DE BROSSE
THAT AWKWARD ARCHITECT OF THE SAINT GERVAIS PORTAL
SO MUCH FOR ART
AND AS FOR HISTORY WE HAVE THE GOSSIPING REMINISCENCES OF THE GREAT
PILLAR STILL RINGING WITH THE TATTLE OF THE PATRU
IT IS NOT MUCH
LET US RETURN TO THE VERITABLE GRAND HALL OF THE
VERITABLE OLD PALACE
THE TWO EXTREMITIES OF THIS GIGANTIC PARALLELOGRAM
WERE OCCUPIED THE ONE BY THE FAMOUS MARBLE TABLE SO LONG SO BROAD
AND SO THICK THAT AS THE ANCIENT LAND ROLLS IN A STYLE THAT WOULD HAVE
GIVEN GARGANTUA AN APPETITE SAY SUCH A SLICE OF MARBLE AS WAS NEVER
BEHELD IN THE WORLD THE OTHER BY THE CHAPEL WHERE LOUIS XI
HAD
HIMSELF SCULPTURED ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE VIRGIN AND WHITHER HE CAUSED
TO BE BROUGHT WITHOUT HEEDING THE TWO GAPS THUS MADE IN THE ROW OF
ROYAL STATUES THE STATUES OF CHARLEMAGNE AND OF SAINT LOUIS TWO SAINTS
WHOM HE SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT IN FAVOR IN HEAVEN AS KINGS OF FRANCE
THIS CHAPEL QUITE NEW HAVING BEEN BUILT ONLY SIX YEARS WAS ENTIRELY
IN THAT CHARMING TASTE OF DELICATE ARCHITECTURE OF MARVELLOUS
SCULPTURE OF FINE AND DEEP CHASING WHICH MARKS WITH US THE END OF
THE GOTHIC ERA AND WHICH IS PERPETUATED TO ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE
SIXTEENTH CENTURY IN THE FAIRYLIKE FANCIES OF THE RENAISSANCE
THE
LITTLE OPEN WORK ROSE WINDOW PIERCED ABOVE THE PORTAL WAS IN
PARTICULAR A MASTERPIECE OF LIGHTNESS AND GRACE ONE WOULD HAVE
PRONOUNCED IT A STAR OF LACE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL OPPOSITE THE GREAT DOOR A PLATFORM OF GOLD
BROCADE PLACED AGAINST THE WALL A SPECIAL ENTRANCE TO WHICH HAD BEEN
EFFECTED THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE CORRIDOR OF THE GOLD CHAMBER HAD
BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FLEMISH EMISSARIES AND THE OTHER GREAT PERSONAGES
INVITED TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE MYSTERY PLAY
IT WAS UPON THE MARBLE TABLE THAT THE MYSTERY WAS TO BE ENACTED AS
USUAL
IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED FOR THE PURPOSE EARLY IN THE MORNING
ITS RICH SLABS OF MARBLE ALL SCRATCHED BY THE HEELS OF LAW CLERKS
SUPPORTED A CAGE OF CARPENTER'S WORK OF CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT THE UPPER
SURFACE OF WHICH WITHIN VIEW OF THE WHOLE HALL WAS TO SERVE AS THE
THEATRE AND WHOSE INTERIOR MASKED BY TAPESTRIES WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE
OF DRESSING ROOMS FOR THE PERSONAGES OF THE PIECE
A LADDER NAIVELY
PLACED ON THE OUTSIDE WAS TO SERVE AS MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN
THE DRESSING ROOM AND THE STAGE AND LEND ITS RUDE RUNGS TO ENTRANCES AS
WELL AS TO EXITS
THERE WAS NO PERSONAGE HOWEVER UNEXPECTED NO SUDDEN
CHANGE NO THEATRICAL EFFECT WHICH WAS NOT OBLIGED TO MOUNT THAT
LADDER
INNOCENT AND VENERABLE INFANCY OF ART AND CONTRIVANCES
FOUR OF THE BAILIFF OF THE PALACE'S SERGEANTS PERFUNCTORY GUARDIANS OF
ALL THE PLEASURES OF THE PEOPLE ON DAYS OF FESTIVAL AS WELL AS ON DAYS
OF EXECUTION STOOD AT THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE MARBLE TABLE
THE PIECE WAS ONLY TO BEGIN WITH THE TWELFTH STROKE OF THE GREAT PALACE
CLOCK SOUNDING MIDDAY
IT WAS VERY LATE NO DOUBT FOR A THEATRICAL
REPRESENTATION BUT THEY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO FIX THE HOUR TO SUIT THE
CONVENIENCE OF THE AMBASSADORS
NOW THIS WHOLE MULTITUDE HAD BEEN WAITING SINCE MORNING
A GOODLY
NUMBER OF CURIOUS GOOD PEOPLE HAD BEEN SHIVERING SINCE DAYBREAK BEFORE
THE GRAND STAIRCASE OF THE PALACE SOME EVEN AFFIRMED THAT THEY HAD
PASSED THE NIGHT ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE GREAT DOOR IN ORDER TO
MAKE SURE THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO PASS IN
THE CROWD GREW MORE
DENSE EVERY MOMENT AND LIKE WATER WHICH RISES ABOVE ITS NORMAL LEVEL
BEGAN TO MOUNT ALONG THE WALLS TO SWELL AROUND THE PILLARS TO SPREAD
OUT ON THE ENTABLATURES ON THE CORNICES ON THE WINDOW SILLS ON
ALL THE SALIENT POINTS OF THE ARCHITECTURE ON ALL THE RELIEFS OF THE
SCULPTURE
HENCE DISCOMFORT IMPATIENCE WEARINESS THE LIBERTY OF A
DAY OF CYNICISM AND FOLLY THE QUARRELS WHICH BREAK FORTH FOR ALL SORTS
OF CAUSES A POINTED ELBOW AN IRON SHOD SHOE THE FATIGUE OF LONG
WAITING HAD ALREADY LONG BEFORE THE HOUR APPOINTED FOR THE ARRIVAL
OF THE AMBASSADORS IMPARTED A HARSH AND BITTER ACCENT TO THE CLAMOR OF
THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE SHUT IN FITTED INTO EACH OTHER PRESSED TRAMPLED
UPON STIFLED
NOTHING WAS TO BE HEARD BUT IMPRECATIONS ON THE FLEMISH
THE PROVOST OF THE MERCHANTS THE CARDINAL DE BOURBON THE BAILIFF OF
THE COURTS MADAME MARGUERITE OF AUSTRIA THE SERGEANTS WITH THEIR RODS
THE COLD THE HEAT THE BAD WEATHER THE BISHOP OF PARIS THE POPE OF
THE FOOLS THE PILLARS THE STATUES THAT CLOSED DOOR THAT OPEN WINDOW
ALL TO THE VAST AMUSEMENT OF A BAND OF SCHOLARS AND LACKEYS SCATTERED
THROUGH THE MASS WHO MINGLED WITH ALL THIS DISCONTENT THEIR TEASING
REMARKS AND THEIR MALICIOUS SUGGESTIONS AND PRICKED THE GENERAL BAD
TEMPER WITH A PIN SO TO SPEAK
AMONG THE REST THERE WAS A GROUP OF THOSE MERRY IMPS WHO AFTER
SMASHING THE GLASS IN A WINDOW HAD SEATED THEMSELVES HARDILY ON
THE ENTABLATURE AND FROM THAT POINT DESPATCHED THEIR GAZE AND THEIR
RAILLERIES BOTH WITHIN AND WITHOUT UPON THE THRONG IN THE HALL AND THE
THRONG UPON THE PLACE
IT WAS EASY TO SEE FROM THEIR PARODIED GESTURES
THEIR RINGING LAUGHTER THE BANTERING APPEALS WHICH THEY EXCHANGED WITH
THEIR COMRADES FROM ONE END OF THE HALL TO THE OTHER THAT THESE
YOUNG CLERKS DID NOT SHARE THE WEARINESS AND FATIGUE OF THE REST OF THE
SPECTATORS AND THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD VERY WELL THE ART OF EXTRACTING
FOR THEIR OWN PRIVATE DIVERSION FROM THAT WHICH THEY HAD UNDER THEIR
EYES A SPECTACLE WHICH MADE THEM AWAIT THE OTHER WITH PATIENCE
UPON MY SOUL SO IT'S YOU 'JOANNES FROLLO DE MOLENDINO CRIED ONE
OF THEM TO A SORT OF LITTLE LIGHT HAIRED IMP WITH A WELL FAVORED AND
MALIGN COUNTENANCE CLINGING TO THE ACANTHUS LEAVES OF A CAPITAL YOU

HOW LONG HAVE YOU

HOURS AND MORE AND I HOPE THAT THEY WILL BE RECKONED TO MY CREDIT IN

FIRST VERSE OF SEVEN O'CLOCK MASS IN THE SAINTE CHAPELLE
FINE SINGERS REPLIED THE OTHER WITH VOICES EVEN MORE POINTED THAN
THEIR CAPS BEFORE FOUNDING A MASS FOR MONSIEUR SAINT JOHN THE KING
SHOULD HAVE INQUIRED WHETHER MONSIEUR SAINT JOHN LIKES LATIN DRONED OUT
IN A PROVENAL ACCENT
HE DID IT FOR THE SAKE OF EMPLOYING THOSE ACCURSED SINGERS OF THE KING
OF SICILY CRIED AN OLD WOMAN SHARPLY FROM AMONG THE CROWD BENEATH THE
WINDOW

HE PERSPIRED AND PANTED IN VAIN LIKE A WEDGE ENTERING THE WOOD HIS
EFFORTS SERVED ONLY TO BURY STILL MORE DEEPLY IN THE SHOULDERS OF HIS
NEIGHBORS HIS LARGE APOPLECTIC FACE PURPLE WITH SPITE AND RAGE
AT LENGTH ONE OF THESE AS FAT SHORT AND VENERABLE AS HIMSELF CAME TO

GOOD DAY MISTER ELECTOR
GOOD NIGHT MADAME ELECTRESS
HOW HAPPY THEY ARE TO SEE ALL THAT SIGHED JOANNES DE MOLENDINO STILL
PERCHED IN THE FOLIAGE OF HIS CAPITAL
MEANWHILE THE SWORN BOOKSELLER OF THE UNIVERSITY MASTER ANDRY MUSNIER
WAS INCLINING HIS EAR TO THE FURRIER OF THE KING'S ROBES MASTER GILLES
LECORNU
I TELL YOU SIR THAT THE END OF THE WORLD HAS COME
NO ONE HAS EVER
BEHELD SUCH OUTBREAKS AMONG THE STUDENTS IT IS THE ACCURSED INVENTIONS
OF THIS CENTURY THAT ARE RUINING EVERYTHING ARTILLERIES BOMBARDS
AND ABOVE ALL PRINTING THAT OTHER GERMAN PEST
NO MORE MANUSCRIPTS
NO MORE BOOKS PRINTING WILL KILL BOOKSELLING
IT IS THE END OF THE
WORLD THAT IS DRAWING NIGH
I SEE THAT PLAINLY FROM THE PROGRESS OF VELVET STUFFS SAID THE
FUR MERCHANT
AT THIS MOMENT MIDDAY SOUNDED
HA EXCLAIMED THE ENTIRE CROWD IN ONE VOICE
THE SCHOLARS HELD THEIR PEACE
THEN A GREAT HURLY BURLY ENSUED A VAST
MOVEMENT OF FEET HANDS AND HEADS A GENERAL OUTBREAK OF COUGHS AND
HANDKERCHIEFS EACH ONE ARRANGED HIMSELF ASSUMED HIS POST RAISED
HIMSELF UP AND GROUPED HIMSELF
THEN CAME A GREAT SILENCE ALL NECKS
REMAINED OUTSTRETCHED ALL MOUTHS REMAINED OPEN ALL GLANCES WERE
DIRECTED TOWARDS THE MARBLE TABLE
NOTHING MADE ITS APPEARANCE THERE
THE BAILIFF'S FOUR SERGEANTS WERE STILL THERE STIFF MOTIONLESS AS
PAINTED STATUES
ALL EYES TURNED TO THE ESTRADE RESERVED FOR THE FLEMISH
ENVOYS
THE DOOR REMAINED CLOSED THE PLATFORM EMPTY
THIS CROWD HAD
BEEN WAITING SINCE DAYBREAK FOR THREE THINGS NOONDAY THE EMBASSY FROM
FLANDERS THE MYSTERY PLAY
NOONDAY ALONE HAD ARRIVED ON TIME
ON THIS OCCASION IT WAS TOO MUCH
THEY WAITED ONE TWO THREE FIVE MINUTES A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOTHING
CAME
THE DAIS REMAINED EMPTY THE THEATRE DUMB
IN THE MEANTIME WRATH
HAD SUCCEEDED TO IMPATIENCE
IRRITATED WORDS CIRCULATED IN A LOW TONE
STILL IT IS TRUE
THE MYSTERY THE MYSTERY THEY MURMURED IN HOLLOW
VOICES
HEADS BEGAN TO FERMENT
A TEMPEST WHICH WAS ONLY RUMBLING IN
THE DISTANCE AS YET WAS FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THIS CROWD
IT WAS
JEHAN DU MOULIN WHO STRUCK THE FIRST SPARK FROM IT
THE MYSTERY AND TO THE DEVIL WITH THE FLEMINGS HE EXCLAIMED AT THE
FULL FORCE OF HIS LUNGS TWINING LIKE A SERPENT AROUND HIS PILLAR
THE CROWD CLAPPED THEIR HANDS
THE MYSTERY IT REPEATED AND MAY ALL THE DEVILS TAKE FLANDERS
WE MUST HAVE THE MYSTERY INSTANTLY RESUMED THE STUDENT OR ELSE
MY ADVICE IS THAT WE SHOULD HANG THE BAILIFF OF THE COURTS BY WAY OF A
MORALITY AND A COMEDY
WELL SAID CRIED THE PEOPLE AND LET US BEGIN THE HANGING WITH HIS
SERGEANTS
A GRAND ACCLAMATION FOLLOWED
THE FOUR POOR FELLOWS BEGAN TO TURN PALE
AND TO EXCHANGE GLANCES
THE CROWD HURLED ITSELF TOWARDS THEM AND THEY
ALREADY BEHELD THE FRAIL WOODEN RAILING WHICH SEPARATED THEM FROM IT
GIVING WAY AND BENDING BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF THE THRONG
IT WAS A CRITICAL MOMENT
TO THE SACK TO THE SACK ROSE THE CRY ON ALL SIDES
AT THAT MOMENT THE TAPESTRY OF THE DRESSING ROOM WHICH WE HAVE
DESCRIBED ABOVE WAS RAISED AND AFFORDED PASSAGE TO A PERSONAGE THE
MERE SIGHT OF WHOM SUDDENLY STOPPED THE CROWD AND CHANGED ITS WRATH
INTO CURIOSITY AS BY ENCHANTMENT
SILENCE SILENCE
THE PERSONAGE BUT LITTLE REASSURED AND TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB
ADVANCED TO THE EDGE OF THE MARBLE TABLE WITH A VAST AMOUNT OF BOWS
WHICH IN PROPORTION AS HE DREW NEARER MORE AND MORE RESEMBLED
GENUFLECTIONS
IN THE MEANWHILE TRANQUILLITY HAD GRADUALLY BEEN RESTORED
ALL THAT
REMAINED WAS THAT SLIGHT MURMUR WHICH ALWAYS RISES ABOVE THE SILENCE OF
A CROWD
MESSIEURS THE BOURGEOIS SAID HE AND MESDEMOISELLES THE
BOURGEOISES WE SHALL HAVE THE HONOR OF DECLAIMING AND REPRESENTING
BEFORE HIS EMINENCE MONSIEUR THE CARDINAL A VERY BEAUTIFUL MORALITY
WHICH HAS FOR ITS TITLE 'THE GOOD JUDGMENT OF MADAME THE VIRGIN MARY
I AM TO PLAY JUPITER
HIS EMINENCE IS AT THIS MOMENT ESCORTING THE
VERY HONORABLE EMBASSY OF THE DUKE OF AUSTRIA WHICH IS DETAINED
AT PRESENT LISTENING TO THE HARANGUE OF MONSIEUR THE RECTOR OF THE
UNIVERSITY AT THE GATE BAUDETS
AS SOON AS HIS ILLUSTRIOUS EMINENCE
THE CARDINAL ARRIVES WE WILL BEGIN
IT IS CERTAIN THAT NOTHING LESS THAN THE INTERVENTION OF JUPITER WAS
REQUIRED TO SAVE THE FOUR UNFORTUNATE SERGEANTS OF THE BAILIFF OF THE
COURTS
IF WE HAD THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING INVENTED THIS VERY VERACIOUS
TALE AND OF BEING IN CONSEQUENCE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT BEFORE OUR LADY
CRITICISM IT IS NOT AGAINST US THAT THE CLASSIC PRECEPT NEC DEUS
INTERSIT COULD BE INVOKED
MOREOVER THE COSTUME OF SEIGNEUR JUPITER
WAS VERY HANDSOME AND CONTRIBUTED NOT A LITTLE TOWARDS CALMING THE
CROWD BY ATTRACTING ALL ITS ATTENTION
JUPITER WAS CLAD IN A COAT OF
MAIL COVERED WITH BLACK VELVET WITH GILT NAILS AND HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR THE ROUGE AND THE HUGE RED BEARD EACH OF WHICH COVERED ONE HALF OF
HIS FACE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ROLL OF GILDED CARDBOARD SPANGLED
AND ALL BRISTLING WITH STRIPS OF TINSEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND AND
IN WHICH THE EYES OF THE INITIATED EASILY RECOGNIZED THUNDERBOLTS HAD
NOT HIS FEET BEEN FLESH COLORED AND BANDED WITH RIBBONS IN GREEK
FASHION HE MIGHT HAVE BORNE COMPARISON SO FAR AS THE SEVERITY OF HIS
MIEN WAS CONCERNED WITH A BRETON ARCHER FROM THE GUARD OF MONSIEUR DE
BERRY
CHAPTER II
PIERRE GRINGOIRE
NEVERTHELESS AS BE HARANGUED THEM THE SATISFACTION AND ADMIRATION
UNANIMOUSLY EXCITED BY HIS COSTUME WERE DISSIPATED BY HIS WORDS AND
WHEN HE REACHED THAT UNTOWARD CONCLUSION AS SOON AS HIS ILLUSTRIOUS
EMINENCE THE CARDINAL ARRIVES WE WILL BEGIN HIS VOICE WAS DROWNED
IN A THUNDER OF HOOTING
BEGIN INSTANTLY THE MYSTERY THE MYSTERY IMMEDIATELY SHRIEKED THE
PEOPLE
AND ABOVE ALL THE VOICES THAT OF JOHANNES DE MOLENDINO
WAS AUDIBLE PIERCING THE UPROAR LIKE THE FIFE'S DERISIVE SERENADE
COMMENCE INSTANTLY YELPED THE SCHOLAR
DOWN WITH JUPITER AND THE CARDINAL DE BOURBON VOCIFERATED ROBIN
POUSSEPAIN AND THE OTHER CLERKS PERCHED IN THE WINDOW
THE MORALITY THIS VERY INSTANT REPEATED THE CROWD THIS VERY
INSTANT THE SACK AND THE ROPE FOR THE COMEDIANS AND THE CARDINAL
POOR JUPITER HAGGARD FRIGHTENED PALE BENEATH HIS ROUGE DROPPED HIS
THUNDERBOLT TOOK HIS CAP IN HIS HAND THEN HE BOWED AND TREMBLED
AND STAMMERED HIS EMINENCE THE AMBASSADORS MADAME MARGUERITE OF
FLANDERS HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
IN TRUTH HE WAS AFRAID OF
BEING HUNG
HUNG BY THE POPULACE FOR WAITING HUNG BY THE CARDINAL FOR NOT HAVING
WAITED HE SAW BETWEEN THE TWO DILEMMAS ONLY AN ABYSS THAT IS TO SAY A
GALLOWS
LUCKILY SOME ONE CAME TO RESCUE HIM FROM HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND ASSUME
THE RESPONSIBILITY
AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STANDING BEYOND THE RAILING IN THE FREE SPACE
AROUND THE MARBLE TABLE AND WHOM NO ONE HAD YET CAUGHT SIGHT OF SINCE
HIS LONG THIN BODY WAS COMPLETELY SHELTERED FROM EVERY VISUAL RAY
BY THE DIAMETER OF THE PILLAR AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING THIS
INDIVIDUAL WE SAY TALL GAUNT PALLID BLOND STILL YOUNG ALTHOUGH
ALREADY WRINKLED ABOUT THE BROW AND CHEEKS WITH BRILLIANT EYES AND A
SMILING MOUTH CLAD IN GARMENTS OF BLACK SERGE WORN AND SHINING WITH
AGE APPROACHED THE MARBLE TABLE AND MADE A SIGN TO THE POOR SUFFERER
BUT THE OTHER WAS SO CONFUSED THAT HE DID NOT SEE HIM
THE NEW COMER
ADVANCED ANOTHER STEP
JUPITER SAID HE MY DEAR JUPITER
THE OTHER DID NOT HEAR
AT LAST THE TALL BLOND DRIVEN OUT OF PATIENCE SHRIEKED ALMOST IN HIS
FACE
MICHEL GIBORNE
WHO CALLS ME SAID JUPITER AS THOUGH AWAKENED WITH A START
I REPLIED THE PERSON CLAD IN BLACK
AH SAID JUPITER
BEGIN AT ONCE WENT ON THE OTHER
SATISFY THE POPULACE I UNDERTAKE
TO APPEASE THE BAILIFF WHO WILL APPEASE MONSIEUR THE CARDINAL
JUPITER BREATHED ONCE MORE
MESSEIGNEURS THE BOURGEOIS HE CRIED AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS TO THE
CROWD WHICH CONTINUED TO HOOT HIM WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN AT ONCE
EVOE JUPITER PLAUDITE CIVES ALL HAIL JUPITER APPLAUD CITIZENS
SHOUTED THE SCHOLARS
NOEL NOEL GOOD GOOD SHOUTED THE PEOPLE
THE HAND CLAPPING WAS DEAFENING AND JUPITER HAD ALREADY WITHDRAWN UNDER
HIS TAPESTRY WHILE THE HALL STILL TREMBLED WITH ACCLAMATIONS
IN THE MEANWHILE THE PERSONAGE WHO HAD SO MAGICALLY TURNED THE TEMPEST
INTO DEAD CALM AS OUR OLD AND DEAR CORNEILLE PUTS IT HAD MODESTLY
RETREATED TO THE HALF SHADOW OF HIS PILLAR AND WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE
REMAINED INVISIBLE THERE MOTIONLESS AND MUTE AS BEFORE HAD HE NOT
BEEN PLUCKED BY THE SLEEVE BY TWO YOUNG WOMEN WHO STANDING IN THE
FRONT ROW OF THE SPECTATORS HAD NOTICED HIS COLLOQUY WITH MICHEL
GIBORNE JUPITER
MASTER SAID ONE OF THEM MAKING HIM A SIGN TO APPROACH
HOLD YOUR
TONGUE MY DEAR LINARDE SAID HER NEIGHBOR PRETTY FRESH AND VERY
BRAVE IN CONSEQUENCE OF BEING DRESSED UP IN HER BEST ATTIRE
HE IS NOT
A CLERK HE IS A LAYMAN YOU MUST NOT SAY MASTER TO HIM BUT MESSIRE
MESSIRE SAID LINARDE
THE STRANGER APPROACHED THE RAILING
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE OF ME DAMSELS HE ASKED WITH ALACRITY
OH NOTHING REPLIED LINARDE IN GREAT CONFUSION IT IS MY NEIGHBOR
GISQUETTE LA GENCIENNE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK WITH YOU
NOT SO REPLIED GISQUETTE BLUSHING IT WAS LINARDE WHO CALLED YOU
MASTER I ONLY TOLD HER TO SAY MESSIRE
THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS DROPPED THEIR EYES
THE MAN WHO ASKED NOTHING
BETTER THAN TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION LOOKED AT THEM WITH A SMILE
SO YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ME DAMSELS
OH NOTHING AT ALL REPLIED GISQUETTE
NOTHING SAID LINARDE
THE TALL LIGHT HAIRED YOUNG MAN RETREATED A STEP BUT THE TWO CURIOUS
MAIDENS HAD NO MIND TO LET SLIP THEIR PRIZE
MESSIRE SAID GISQUETTE WITH THE IMPETUOSITY OF AN OPEN SLUICE OR
OF A WOMAN WHO HAS MADE UP HER MIND DO YOU KNOW THAT SOLDIER WHO IS TO
PLAY THE PART OF MADAME THE VIRGIN IN THE MYSTERY
YOU MEAN THE PART OF JUPITER REPLIED THE STRANGER
H YES SAID LINARDE ISN'T SHE STUPID SO YOU KNOW JUPITER
MICHEL GIBORNE REPLIED THE UNKNOWN YES MADAM
HE HAS A FINE BEARD SAID LINARDE
WILL WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO SAY HERE BE FINE INQUIRED GISQUETTE
TIMIDLY
VERY FINE MADEMOISELLE REPLIED THE UNKNOWN WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST
HESITATION
WHAT IS IT TO BE SAID LINARDE
'THE GOOD JUDGMENT OF MADAME THE VIRGIN A MORALITY IF YOU PLEASE
DAMSEL
AH THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE RESPONDED LINARDE
A BRIEF SILENCE ENSUED BROKEN BY THE STRANGER
IT IS A PERFECTLY NEW MORALITY AND ONE WHICH HAS NEVER YET BEEN
PLAYED
THEN IT IS NOT THE SAME ONE SAID GISQUETTE THAT WAS GIVEN TWO YEARS
AGO ON THE DAY OF THE ENTRANCE OF MONSIEUR THE LEGATE AND WHERE THREE
HANDSOME MAIDS PLAYED THE PARTS
OF SIRENS SAID LINARDE
AND ALL NAKED ADDED THE YOUNG MAN
LINARDE LOWERED HER EYES MODESTLY
GISQUETTE GLANCED AT HER AND DID THE
SAME
HE CONTINUED WITH A SMILE
IT WAS A VERY PLEASANT THING TO SEE
TO DAY IT IS A MORALITY MADE
EXPRESSLY FOR MADAME THE DEMOISELLE OF FLANDERS
WILL THEY SING SHEPHERD SONGS INQUIRED GISQUETTE
FIE SAID THE STRANGER IN A MORALITY YOU MUST NOT CONFOUND STYLES
IF IT WERE A FARCE WELL AND GOOD
THAT IS A PITY RESUMED GISQUETTE
THAT DAY AT THE PONCEAU FOUNTAIN
THERE WERE WILD MEN AND WOMEN WHO FOUGHT AND ASSUMED MANY ASPECTS AS
THEY SANG LITTLE MOTETS AND BERGERETTES
THAT WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR A LEGATE RETURNED THE STRANGER WITH A
GOOD DEAL OF DRYNESS IS NOT SUITABLE FOR A PRINCESS
AND BESIDE THEM RESUMED LINARDE PLAYED MANY BRASS INSTRUMENTS
MAKING GREAT MELODIES
AND FOR THE REFRESHMENT OF THE PASSERS BY CONTINUED GISQUETTE THE
FOUNTAIN SPOUTED THROUGH THREE MOUTHS WINE MILK AND HIPPOCRASS OF
WHICH EVERY ONE DRANK WHO WISHED
AND A LITTLE BELOW THE PONCEAU AT THE TRINITY PURSUED LINARDE
THERE WAS A PASSION PERFORMED AND WITHOUT ANY SPEAKING
HOW WELL I REMEMBER THAT EXCLAIMED GISQUETTE GOD ON THE CROSS
AND THE TWO THIEVES ON THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT HERE THE YOUNG GOSSIPS
GROWING WARM AT THE MEMORY OF THE ENTRANCE OF MONSIEUR THE LEGATE BOTH
BEGAN TO TALK AT ONCE
AND FURTHER ON AT THE PAINTERS' GATE THERE WERE OTHER PERSONAGES
VERY RICHLY CLAD
AND AT THE FOUNTAIN OF SAINT INNOCENT THAT HUNTSMAN WHO WAS CHASING A
HIND WITH GREAT CLAMOR OF DOGS AND HUNTING HORNS
AND AT THE PARIS SLAUGHTER HOUSES STAGES REPRESENTING THE FORTRESS
OF DIEPPE
AND WHEN THE LEGATE PASSED YOU REMEMBER GISQUETTE THEY MADE THE
ASSAULT AND THE ENGLISH ALL HAD THEIR THROATS CUT
AND AGAINST THE GATE OF THE CHTELET THERE WERE VERY FINE PERSONAGES
AND ON THE PORT AU CHANGE WHICH WAS ALL DRAPED ABOVE
AND WHEN THE LEGATE PASSED THEY LET FLY ON THE BRIDGE MORE THAN TWO
HUNDRED SORTS OF BIRDS WASN'T IT BEAUTIFUL LINARDE
IT WILL BE BETTER TO DAY FINALLY RESUMED THEIR INTERLOCUTOR WHO
SEEMED TO LISTEN TO THEM WITH IMPATIENCE
DO YOU PROMISE US THAT THIS MYSTERY WILL BE FINE SAID GISQUETTE
WITHOUT DOUBT HE REPLIED THEN HE ADDED WITH A CERTAIN EMPHASIS I
AM THE AUTHOR OF IT DAMSELS
TRULY SAID THE YOUNG GIRLS QUITE TAKEN ABACK
TRULY REPLIED THE POET BRIDLING A LITTLE THAT IS TO SAY THERE
ARE TWO OF US JEHAN MARCHAND WHO HAS SAWED THE PLANKS AND ERECTED
THE FRAMEWORK OF THE THEATRE AND THE WOODWORK AND I WHO HAVE MADE THE
PIECE
MY NAME IS PIERRE GRINGOIRE
THE AUTHOR OF THE CID COULD NOT HAVE SAID PIERRE CORNEILLE WITH MORE
PRIDE
OUR READERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBSERVE THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME
MUST HAVE ALREADY ELAPSED FROM THE MOMENT WHEN JUPITER HAD RETIRED
BENEATH THE TAPESTRY TO THE INSTANT WHEN THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW MORALITY
HAD THUS ABRUPTLY REVEALED HIMSELF TO THE INNOCENT ADMIRATION OF
GISQUETTE AND LINARDE
REMARKABLE FACT THAT WHOLE CROWD SO TUMULTUOUS
BUT A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE NOW WAITED AMIABLY ON THE WORD OF THE
COMEDIAN WHICH PROVES THE ETERNAL TRUTH STILL EXPERIENCED EVERY DAY IN
OUR THEATRES THAT THE BEST MEANS OF MAKING THE PUBLIC WAIT PATIENTLY IS
TO ASSURE THEM THAT ONE IS ABOUT TO BEGIN INSTANTLY
HOWEVER SCHOLAR JOHANNES HAD NOT FALLEN ASLEEP
HOL H HE SHOUTED SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF THE PEACEABLE WAITING
WHICH HAD FOLLOWED THE TUMULT
JUPITER MADAME THE VIRGIN BUFFOONS OF
THE DEVIL ARE YOU JEERING AT US THE PIECE THE PIECE COMMENCE OR WE
WILL COMMENCE AGAIN
THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED
THE MUSIC OF HIGH AND LOW INSTRUMENTS IMMEDIATELY BECAME AUDIBLE FROM
THE INTERIOR OF THE STAGE THE TAPESTRY WAS RAISED FOUR PERSONAGES
IN MOTLEY ATTIRE AND PAINTED FACES EMERGED FROM IT CLIMBED THE STEEP
LADDER OF THE THEATRE AND ARRIVED UPON THE UPPER PLATFORM ARRANGED
THEMSELVES IN A LINE BEFORE THE PUBLIC WHOM THEY SALUTED WITH PROFOUND
REVERENCES THEN THE SYMPHONY CEASED
THE MYSTERY WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN
THE FOUR PERSONAGES AFTER HAVING REAPED A RICH REWARD OF APPLAUSE FOR
THEIR REVERENCES BEGAN IN THE MIDST OF PROFOUND SILENCE A PROLOGUE
WHICH WE GLADLY SPARE THE READER
MOREOVER AS HAPPENS IN OUR OWN DAY
THE PUBLIC WAS MORE OCCUPIED WITH THE COSTUMES THAT THE ACTORS WORE THAN
WITH THE ROLES THAT THEY WERE ENACTING AND IN TRUTH THEY WERE RIGHT
ALL FOUR WERE DRESSED IN PARTI COLORED ROBES OF YELLOW AND WHITE WHICH
WERE DISTINGUISHED FROM EACH OTHER ONLY BY THE NATURE OF THE STUFF THE
FIRST WAS OF GOLD AND SILVER BROCADE THE SECOND OF SILK THE THIRD OF
WOOL THE FOURTH OF LINEN
THE FIRST OF THESE PERSONAGES CARRIED IN HIS
RIGHT HAND A SWORD THE SECOND TWO GOLDEN KEYS THE THIRD A PAIR OF
SCALES THE FOURTH A SPADE AND IN ORDER TO AID SLUGGISH MINDS
WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN CLEARLY THROUGH THE TRANSPARENCY OF THESE
ATTRIBUTES THERE WAS TO BE READ IN LARGE BLACK LETTERS ON THE HEM OF
THE ROBE OF BROCADE MY NAME IS NOBILITY ON THE HEM OF THE SILKEN
ROBE MY NAME IS CLERGY ON THE HEM OF THE WOOLEN ROBE MY NAME IS
MERCHANDISE ON THE HEM OF THE LINEN ROBE MY NAME IS LABOR
THE SEX
OF THE TWO MALE CHARACTERS WAS BRIEFLY INDICATED TO EVERY JUDICIOUS
SPECTATOR BY THEIR SHORTER ROBES AND BY THE CAP WHICH THEY WORE ON
THEIR HEADS WHILE THE TWO FEMALE CHARACTERS LESS BRIEFLY CLAD WERE
COVERED WITH HOODS
MUCH ILL WILL WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN REQUIRED NOT TO COMPREHEND THROUGH
THE MEDIUM OF THE POETRY OF THE PROLOGUE THAT LABOR WAS WEDDED TO
MERCHANDISE AND CLERGY TO NOBILITY AND THAT THE TWO HAPPY COUPLES
POSSESSED IN COMMON A MAGNIFICENT GOLDEN DOLPHIN WHICH THEY DESIRED
TO ADJUDGE TO THE FAIREST ONLY
SO THEY WERE ROAMING ABOUT THE WORLD
SEEKING AND SEARCHING FOR THIS BEAUTY AND AFTER HAVING SUCCESSIVELY
REJECTED THE QUEEN OF GOLCONDA THE PRINCESS OF TREBIZONDE THE DAUGHTER
OF THE GRAND KHAN OF TARTARY ETC LABOR AND CLERGY NOBILITY AND
MERCHANDISE HAD COME TO REST UPON THE MARBLE TABLE OF THE PALAIS DE
JUSTICE AND TO UTTER IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HONEST AUDIENCE AS MANY
SENTENCES AND MAXIMS AS COULD THEN BE DISPENSED AT THE FACULTY OF ARTS
AT EXAMINATIONS SOPHISMS DETERMINANCES FIGURES AND ACTS WHERE THE
MASTERS TOOK THEIR DEGREES
ALL THIS WAS IN FACT VERY FINE
NEVERTHELESS IN THAT THRONG UPON WHICH THE FOUR ALLEGORIES VIED WITH
EACH OTHER IN POURING OUT FLOODS OF METAPHORS THERE WAS NO EAR MORE
ATTENTIVE NO HEART THAT PALPITATED MORE NOT AN EYE WAS MORE HAGGARD
NO NECK MORE OUTSTRETCHED THAN THE EYE THE EAR THE NECK AND THE
HEART OF THE AUTHOR OF THE POET OF THAT BRAVE PIERRE GRINGOIRE WHO
HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESIST A MOMENT BEFORE THE JOY OF TELLING HIS
NAME TO TWO PRETTY GIRLS
HE HAD RETREATED A FEW PACES FROM THEM BEHIND
HIS PILLAR AND THERE HE LISTENED LOOKED ENJOYED
THE AMIABLE APPLAUSE
WHICH HAD GREETED THE BEGINNING OF HIS PROLOGUE WAS STILL ECHOING IN
HIS BOSOM AND HE WAS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN THAT SPECIES OF ECSTATIC
CONTEMPLATION WITH WHICH AN AUTHOR BEHOLDS HIS IDEAS FALL ONE BY ONE
FROM THE MOUTH OF THE ACTOR INTO THE VAST SILENCE OF THE AUDIENCE
WORTHY PIERRE GRINGOIRE
IT PAINS US TO SAY IT BUT THIS FIRST ECSTASY WAS SPEEDILY DISTURBED
HARDLY HAD GRINGOIRE RAISED THIS INTOXICATING CUP OF JOY AND TRIUMPH TO
HIS LIPS WHEN A DROP OF BITTERNESS WAS MINGLED WITH IT
A TATTERED MENDICANT WHO COULD NOT COLLECT ANY COINS LOST AS HE WAS
IN THE MIDST OF THE CROWD AND WHO HAD NOT PROBABLY FOUND SUFFICIENT
INDEMNITY IN THE POCKETS OF HIS NEIGHBORS HAD HIT UPON THE IDEA OF
PERCHING HIMSELF UPON SOME CONSPICUOUS POINT IN ORDER TO ATTRACT LOOKS
AND ALMS
HE HAD ACCORDINGLY HOISTED HIMSELF DURING THE FIRST VERSES
OF THE PROLOGUE WITH THE AID OF THE PILLARS OF THE RESERVE GALLERY TO
THE CORNICE WHICH RAN ROUND THE BALUSTRADE AT ITS LOWER EDGE AND THERE
HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF SOLICITING THE ATTENTION AND THE PITY OF THE
MULTITUDE WITH HIS RAGS AND A HIDEOUS SORE WHICH COVERED HIS RIGHT ARM
HOWEVER HE UTTERED NOT A WORD
THE SILENCE WHICH HE PRESERVED ALLOWED THE PROLOGUE TO PROCEED WITHOUT
HINDRANCE AND NO PERCEPTIBLE DISORDER WOULD HAVE ENSUED IF ILL LUCK
HAD NOT WILLED THAT THE SCHOLAR JOANNES SHOULD CATCH SIGHT FROM THE
HEIGHTS OF HIS PILLAR OF THE MENDICANT AND HIS GRIMACES
A WILD FIT OF
LAUGHTER TOOK POSSESSION OF THE YOUNG SCAMP WHO WITHOUT CARING THAT HE
WAS INTERRUPTING THE SPECTACLE AND DISTURBING THE UNIVERSAL COMPOSURE
SHOUTED BOLDLY
LOOK SEE THAT SICKLY CREATURE ASKING ALMS
ANY ONE WHO HAS THROWN A STONE INTO A FROG POND OR FIRED A SHOT INTO
A COVEY OF BIRDS CAN FORM AN IDEA OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY THESE
INCONGRUOUS WORDS IN THE MIDST OF THE GENERAL ATTENTION
IT MADE
GRINGOIRE SHUDDER AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN ELECTRIC SHOCK
THE PROLOGUE
STOPPED SHORT AND ALL HEADS TURNED TUMULTUOUSLY TOWARDS THE BEGGAR
WHO FAR FROM BEING DISCONCERTED BY THIS SAW IN THIS INCIDENT A GOOD
OPPORTUNITY FOR REAPING HIS HARVEST AND WHO BEGAN TO WHINE IN A DOLEFUL
WAY HALF CLOSING HIS EYES THE WHILE CHARITY PLEASE
WELL UPON MY SOUL RESUMED JOANNES IT'S CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU HOL
HE MY FRIEND DID YOUR SORE BOTHER YOU ON THE LEG THAT YOU HAVE
TRANSFERRED IT TO YOUR ARM SO SAYING WITH THE DEXTERITY OF A MONKEY
HE FLUNG A BIT OF SILVER INTO THE GRAY FELT HAT WHICH THE BEGGAR HELD
IN HIS AILING ARM
THE MENDICANT RECEIVED BOTH THE ALMS AND THE SARCASM
WITHOUT WINCING AND CONTINUED IN LAMENTABLE TONES
CHARITY PLEASE
THIS EPISODE CONSIDERABLY DISTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE AUDIENCE AND
A GOODLY NUMBER OF SPECTATORS AMONG THEM ROBIN POUSSEPAIN AND ALL THE
CLERKS AT THEIR HEAD GAYLY APPLAUDED THIS ECCENTRIC DUET WHICH THE
SCHOLAR WITH HIS SHRILL VOICE AND THE MENDICANT HAD JUST IMPROVISED IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE PROLOGUE
GRINGOIRE WAS HIGHLY DISPLEASED
ON RECOVERING FROM HIS FIRST
STUPEFACTION HE BESTIRRED HIMSELF TO SHOUT TO THE FOUR PERSONAGES ON
THE STAGE GO ON WHAT THE DEVIL GO ON WITHOUT EVEN DEIGNING TO
CAST A GLANCE OF DISDAIN UPON THE TWO INTERRUPTERS
AT THAT MOMENT HE FELT SOME ONE PLUCK AT THE HEM OF HIS SURTOUT
HE TURNED ROUND AND NOT WITHOUT ILL HUMOR AND FOUND CONSIDERABLE
DIFFICULTY IN SMILING BUT HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO SO NEVERTHELESS
IT
WAS THE PRETTY ARM OF GISQUETTE LA GENCIENNE WHICH PASSED THROUGH THE
RAILING WAS SOLICITING HIS ATTENTION IN THIS MANNER
MONSIEUR SAID THE YOUNG GIRL ARE THEY GOING TO CONTINUE
OF COURSE REPLIED GRINGOIRE A GOOD DEAL SHOCKED BY THE QUESTION
IN THAT CASE MESSIRE SHE RESUMED WOULD YOU HAVE THE COURTESY TO
EXPLAIN TO ME
WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO SAY INTERRUPTED GRINGOIRE
WELL LISTEN
NO SAID GISQUETTE BUT WHAT THEY HAVE SAID SO FAR
GRINGOIRE STARTED LIKE A MAN WHOSE WOUND HAS BEEN PROBED TO THE QUICK
A PLAGUE ON THE STUPID AND DULL WITTED LITTLE GIRL HE MUTTERED
BETWEEN HIS TEETH
FROM THAT MOMENT FORTH GISQUETTE WAS NOTHING TO HIM
IN THE MEANTIME THE ACTORS HAD OBEYED HIS INJUNCTION AND THE PUBLIC
SEEING THAT THEY WERE BEGINNING TO SPEAK AGAIN BEGAN ONCE MORE TO
LISTEN NOT WITHOUT HAVING LOST MANY BEAUTIES IN THE SORT OF SOLDERED
JOINT WHICH WAS FORMED BETWEEN THE TWO PORTIONS OF THE PIECE THUS
ABRUPTLY CUT SHORT
GRINGOIRE COMMENTED ON IT BITTERLY TO HIMSELF
NEVERTHELESS TRANQUILLITY WAS GRADUALLY RESTORED THE SCHOLAR HELD HIS
PEACE THE MENDICANT COUNTED OVER SOME COINS IN HIS HAT AND THE PIECE
RESUMED THE UPPER HAND
IT WAS IN FACT A VERY FINE WORK AND ONE WHICH AS IT SEEMS TO US
MIGHT BE PUT TO USE TO DAY BY THE AID OF A LITTLE REARRANGEMENT
THE
EXPOSITION RATHER LONG AND RATHER EMPTY THAT IS TO SAY ACCORDING TO
THE RULES WAS SIMPLE AND GRINGOIRE IN THE CANDID SANCTUARY OF HIS OWN
CONSCIENCE ADMIRED ITS CLEARNESS
AS THE READER MAY SURMISE THE FOUR
ALLEGORICAL PERSONAGES WERE SOMEWHAT WEARY WITH HAVING TRAVERSED THE
THREE SECTIONS OF THE WORLD WITHOUT HAVING FOUND SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY
FOR GETTING RID OF THEIR GOLDEN DOLPHIN
THEREUPON A EULOGY OF THE
MARVELLOUS FISH WITH A THOUSAND DELICATE ALLUSIONS TO THE YOUNG
BETROTHED OF MARGUERITE OF FLANDERS THEN SADLY CLOISTERED IN AT
AMBOISE AND WITHOUT A SUSPICION THAT LABOR AND CLERGY NOBILITY AND
MERCHANDISE HAD JUST MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE WORLD IN HIS BEHALF
THE
SAID DAUPHIN WAS THEN YOUNG WAS HANDSOME WAS STOUT AND ABOVE ALL
MAGNIFICENT ORIGIN OF ALL ROYAL VIRTUES HE WAS THE SON OF THE LION
OF FRANCE
I DECLARE THAT THIS BOLD METAPHOR IS ADMIRABLE AND THAT THE
NATURAL HISTORY OF THE THEATRE ON A DAY OF ALLEGORY AND ROYAL MARRIAGE
SONGS IS NOT IN THE LEAST STARTLED BY A DOLPHIN WHO IS THE SON OF A
LION
IT IS PRECISELY THESE RARE AND PINDARIC MIXTURES WHICH PROVE THE
POET'S ENTHUSIASM
NEVERTHELESS IN ORDER TO PLAY THE PART OF CRITIC
ALSO THE POET MIGHT HAVE DEVELOPED THIS BEAUTIFUL IDEA IN SOMETHING
LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED LINES
IT IS TRUE THAT THE MYSTERY WAS TO LAST
FROM NOON UNTIL FOUR O'CLOCK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORDERS OF MONSIEUR
THE PROVOST AND THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO SAY SOMETHING
BESIDES THE
PEOPLE LISTENED PATIENTLY
ALL AT ONCE IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF A QUARREL BETWEEN MADEMOISELLE
MERCHANDISE AND MADAME NOBILITY AT THE MOMENT WHEN MONSIEUR LABOR WAS
GIVING UTTERANCE TO THIS WONDERFUL LINE
IN FOREST NE'ER WAS SEEN A MORE TRIUMPHANT BEAST
THE DOOR OF THE RESERVED GALLERY WHICH HAD HITHERTO REMAINED SO
INOPPORTUNELY CLOSED OPENED STILL MORE INOPPORTUNELY AND THE RINGING
VOICE OF THE USHER ANNOUNCED ABRUPTLY HIS EMINENCE MONSEIGNEUR THE
CARDINAL DE BOURBON
CHAPTER III
MONSIEUR THE CARDINAL
POOR GRINGOIRE THE DIN OF ALL THE GREAT DOUBLE PETARDS OF THE
SAINT JEAN THE DISCHARGE OF TWENTY ARQUEBUSES ON SUPPORTS THE
DETONATION OF THAT FAMOUS SERPENTINE OF THE TOWER OF BILLY WHICH
DURING THE SIEGE OF PARIS ON SUNDAY THE TWENTY SIXTH OF SEPTEMBER
1465 KILLED SEVEN BURGUNDIANS AT ONE BLOW THE EXPLOSION OF ALL THE
POWDER STORED AT THE GATE OF THE TEMPLE WOULD HAVE RENT HIS EARS LESS
RUDELY AT THAT SOLEMN AND DRAMATIC MOMENT THAN THESE FEW WORDS WHICH
FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE USHER HIS EMINENCE MONSEIGNEUR THE CARDINAL
DE BOURBON
IT IS NOT THAT PIERRE GRINGOIRE EITHER FEARED OR DISDAINED MONSIEUR THE
CARDINAL
HE HAD NEITHER THE WEAKNESS NOR THE AUDACITY FOR THAT
A TRUE
ECLECTIC AS IT WOULD BE EXPRESSED NOWADAYS GRINGOIRE WAS ONE OF THOSE
FIRM AND LOFTY MODERATE AND CALM SPIRITS WHICH ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO BEAR
THEMSELVES AMID ALL CIRCUMSTANCES STARE IN DIMIDIO RERUM AND WHO
ARE FULL OF REASON AND OF LIBERAL PHILOSOPHY WHILE STILL SETTING
STORE BY CARDINALS
A RARE PRECIOUS AND NEVER INTERRUPTED RACE OF
PHILOSOPHERS TO WHOM WISDOM LIKE ANOTHER ARIADNE SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN
A CLEW OF THREAD WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN WALKING ALONG UNWINDING SINCE
THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD THROUGH THE LABYRINTH OF HUMAN AFFAIRS
ONE
FINDS THEM IN ALL AGES EVER THE SAME THAT IS TO SAY ALWAYS ACCORDING
TO ALL TIMES
AND WITHOUT RECKONING OUR PIERRE GRINGOIRE WHO MAY
REPRESENT THEM IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY IF WE SUCCEED IN BESTOWING UPON
HIM THE DISTINCTION WHICH HE DESERVES IT CERTAINLY WAS THEIR SPIRIT
WHICH ANIMATED FATHER DU BREUL WHEN HE WROTE IN THE SIXTEENTH THESE
NAIVELY SUBLIME WORDS WORTHY OF ALL CENTURIES I AM A PARISIAN BY
NATION AND A PARRHISIAN IN LANGUAGE FOR PARRHISIA IN GREEK SIGNIFIES
LIBERTY OF SPEECH OF WHICH I HAVE MADE USE EVEN TOWARDS MESSEIGNEURS
THE CARDINALS UNCLE AND BROTHER TO MONSIEUR THE PRINCE DE CONTY ALWAYS
WITH RESPECT TO THEIR GREATNESS AND WITHOUT OFFENDING ANY ONE OF THEIR
SUITE WHICH IS MUCH TO SAY
THERE WAS THEN NEITHER HATRED FOR THE CARDINAL NOR DISDAIN FOR HIS
PRESENCE IN THE DISAGREEABLE IMPRESSION PRODUCED UPON PIERRE GRINGOIRE
QUITE THE CONTRARY OUR POET HAD TOO MUCH GOOD SENSE AND TOO THREADBARE
A COAT NOT TO ATTACH PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO HAVING THE NUMEROUS
ALLUSIONS IN HIS PROLOGUE AND IN PARTICULAR THE GLORIFICATION OF THE
DAUPHIN SON OF THE LION OF FRANCE FALL UPON THE MOST EMINENT EAR
BUT
IT IS NOT INTEREST WHICH PREDOMINATES IN THE NOBLE NATURE OF POETS
I
SUPPOSE THAT THE ENTITY OF THE POET MAY BE REPRESENTED BY THE NUMBER
TEN IT IS CERTAIN THAT A CHEMIST ON ANALYZING AND PHARMACOPOLIZING IT
AS RABELAIS SAYS WOULD FIND IT COMPOSED OF ONE PART INTEREST TO NINE
PARTS OF SELF ESTEEM
NOW AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE DOOR HAD OPENED TO ADMIT THE CARDINAL THE
NINE PARTS OF SELF ESTEEM IN GRINGOIRE SWOLLEN AND EXPANDED BY
THE BREATH OF POPULAR ADMIRATION WERE IN A STATE OF PRODIGIOUS
AUGMENTATION BENEATH WHICH DISAPPEARED AS THOUGH STIFLED THAT
IMPERCEPTIBLE MOLECULE OF WHICH WE HAVE JUST REMARKED UPON IN THE
CONSTITUTION OF POETS A PRECIOUS INGREDIENT BY THE WAY A BALLAST
OF REALITY AND HUMANITY WITHOUT WHICH THEY WOULD NOT TOUCH THE EARTH
GRINGOIRE ENJOYED SEEING FEELING FINGERING SO TO SPEAK AN ENTIRE
ASSEMBLY OF KNAVES IT IS TRUE BUT WHAT MATTERS THAT STUPEFIED
PETRIFIED AND AS THOUGH ASPHYXIATED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE
INCOMMENSURABLE TIRADES WHICH WELLED UP EVERY INSTANT FROM ALL PARTS
OF HIS BRIDAL SONG
I AFFIRM THAT HE SHARED THE GENERAL BEATITUDE AND
THAT QUITE THE REVERSE OF LA FONTAINE WHO AT THE PRESENTATION OF HIS
COMEDY OF THE FLORENTINE ASKED WHO IS THE ILL BRED LOUT WHO MADE
THAT RHAPSODY GRINGOIRE WOULD GLADLY HAVE INQUIRED OF HIS NEIGHBOR
WHOSE MASTERPIECE IS THIS
THE READER CAN NOW JUDGE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED UPON HIM BY THE ABRUPT
AND UNSEASONABLE ARRIVAL OF THE CARDINAL
THAT WHICH HE HAD TO FEAR WAS ONLY TOO FULLY REALIZED
THE ENTRANCE OF
HIS EMINENCE UPSET THE AUDIENCE
ALL HEADS TURNED TOWARDS THE GALLERY
IT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO HEAR ONE'S SELF
THE CARDINAL THE
CARDINAL REPEATED ALL MOUTHS
THE UNHAPPY PROLOGUE STOPPED SHORT FOR
THE SECOND TIME
THE CARDINAL HALTED FOR A MOMENT ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE ESTRADE
WHILE
HE WAS SENDING A RATHER INDIFFERENT GLANCE AROUND THE AUDIENCE THE
TUMULT REDOUBLED
EACH PERSON WISHED TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF HIM
EACH MAN VIED WITH THE OTHER IN THRUSTING HIS HEAD OVER HIS NEIGHBOR'S
SHOULDER
HE WAS IN FACT AN EXALTED PERSONAGE THE SIGHT OF WHOM WAS WELL WORTH
ANY OTHER COMEDY
CHARLES CARDINAL DE BOURBON ARCHBISHOP AND COMTE OF
LYON PRIMATE OF THE GAULS WAS ALLIED BOTH TO LOUIS XI THROUGH HIS
BROTHER PIERRE SEIGNEUR DE BEAUJEU WHO HAD MARRIED THE KING'S ELDEST
DAUGHTER AND TO CHARLES THE BOLD THROUGH HIS MOTHER AGNES OF BURGUNDY
NOW THE DOMINATING TRAIT THE PECULIAR AND DISTINCTIVE TRAIT OF THE
CHARACTER OF THE PRIMATE OF THE GAULS WAS THE SPIRIT OF THE COURTIER
AND DEVOTION TO THE POWERS THAT BE
THE READER CAN FORM AN IDEA OF THE
NUMBERLESS EMBARRASSMENTS WHICH THIS DOUBLE RELATIONSHIP HAD CAUSED HIM
AND OF ALL THE TEMPORAL REEFS AMONG WHICH HIS SPIRITUAL BARK HAD BEEN
FORCED TO TACK IN ORDER NOT TO SUFFER SHIPWRECK ON EITHER LOUIS OR
CHARLES THAT SCYLLA AND THAT CHARYBDIS WHICH HAD DEVOURED THE DUC DE
NEMOURS AND THE CONSTABLE DE SAINT POL
THANKS TO HEAVEN'S MERCY HE HAD
MADE THE VOYAGE SUCCESSFULLY AND HAD REACHED HOME WITHOUT HINDRANCE
BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS IN PORT AND PRECISELY BECAUSE HE WAS IN PORT HE
NEVER RECALLED WITHOUT DISQUIET THE VARIED HAPS OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER
SO LONG UNEASY AND LABORIOUS
THUS HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF SAYING THAT
THE YEAR 1476 HAD BEEN WHITE AND BLACK FOR HIM MEANING THEREBY THAT
IN THE COURSE OF THAT YEAR HE HAD LOST HIS MOTHER THE DUCHESSE DE LA
BOURBONNAIS AND HIS COUSIN THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY AND THAT ONE GRIEF
HAD CONSOLED HIM FOR THE OTHER
NEVERTHELESS HE WAS A FINE MAN HE LED A JOYOUS CARDINAL'S LIFE LIKED
TO ENLIVEN HIMSELF WITH THE ROYAL VINTAGE OF CHALLUAU DID NOT HATE
RICHARDE LA GARMOISE AND THOMASSE LA SAILLARDE BESTOWED ALMS ON PRETTY
GIRLS RATHER THAN ON OLD WOMEN AND FOR ALL THESE REASONS WAS VERY
AGREEABLE TO THE POPULACE OF PARIS
HE NEVER WENT ABOUT OTHERWISE
THAN SURROUNDED BY A SMALL COURT OF BISHOPS AND ABBS OF HIGH LINEAGE
GALLANT JOVIAL AND GIVEN TO CAROUSING ON OCCASION AND MORE THAN ONCE
THE GOOD AND DEVOUT WOMEN OF SAINT GERMAIN D' AUXERRE WHEN PASSING
AT NIGHT BENEATH THE BRIGHTLY ILLUMINATED WINDOWS OF BOURBON HAD BEEN
SCANDALIZED TO HEAR THE SAME VOICES WHICH HAD INTONED VESPERS FOR
THEM DURING THE DAY CAROLLING TO THE CLINKING OF GLASSES THE BACCHIC
PROVERB OF BENEDICT XII THAT POPE WHO HAD ADDED A THIRD CROWN TO THE
TIARA BIBAMUS PAPALITER
IT WAS THIS JUSTLY ACQUIRED POPULARITY NO DOUBT WHICH PRESERVED HIM ON
HIS ENTRANCE FROM ANY BAD RECEPTION AT THE HANDS OF THE MOB WHICH HAD
BEEN SO DISPLEASED BUT A MOMENT BEFORE AND VERY LITTLE DISPOSED TO
RESPECT A CARDINAL ON THE VERY DAY WHEN IT WAS TO ELECT A POPE
BUT THE
PARISIANS CHERISH LITTLE RANCOR AND THEN HAVING FORCED THE BEGINNING
OF THE PLAY BY THEIR AUTHORITY THE GOOD BOURGEOIS HAD GOT THE UPPER
HAND OF THE CARDINAL AND THIS TRIUMPH WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THEM
MOREOVER THE CARDINAL DE BOURBON WAS A HANDSOME MAN HE WORE A FINE
SCARLET ROBE WHICH HE CARRIED OFF VERY WELL THAT IS TO SAY HE HAD
ALL THE WOMEN ON HIS SIDE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE BEST HALF OF THE
AUDIENCE
ASSUREDLY IT WOULD BE INJUSTICE AND BAD TASTE TO HOOT A
CARDINAL FOR HAVING COME LATE TO THE SPECTACLE WHEN HE IS A HANDSOME
MAN AND WHEN HE WEARS HIS SCARLET ROBE WELL
HE ENTERED THEN BOWED TO THOSE PRESENT WITH THE HEREDITARY SMILE OF
THE GREAT FOR THE PEOPLE AND DIRECTED HIS COURSE SLOWLY TOWARDS HIS
SCARLET VELVET ARM CHAIR WITH THE AIR OF THINKING OF SOMETHING QUITE
DIFFERENT
HIS CORTEGE WHAT WE SHOULD NOWADAYS CALL HIS STAFF OF
BISHOPS AND ABBS INVADED THE ESTRADE IN HIS TRAIN NOT WITHOUT CAUSING
REDOUBLED TUMULT AND CURIOSITY AMONG THE AUDIENCE
EACH MAN VIED WITH
HIS NEIGHBOR IN POINTING THEM OUT AND NAMING THEM IN SEEING WHO SHOULD
RECOGNIZE AT LEAST ONE OF THEM THIS ONE THE BISHOP OF MARSEILLES
ALAUDET IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT THIS ONE THE PRIMICIER OF
SAINT DENIS THIS ONE ROBERT DE LESPINASSE ABB OF SAINT GERMAIN DES
PRS THAT LIBERTINE BROTHER OF A MISTRESS OF LOUIS XI ALL WITH MANY
ERRORS AND ABSURDITIES
AS FOR THE SCHOLARS THEY SWORE
THIS WAS THEIR
DAY THEIR FEAST OF FOOLS THEIR SATURNALIA THE ANNUAL ORGY OF THE
CORPORATION OF LAW CLERKS AND OF THE SCHOOL
THERE WAS NO TURPITUDE
WHICH WAS NOT SACRED ON THAT DAY
AND THEN THERE WERE GAY GOSSIPS IN THE
CROWD SIMONE QUATRELIVRES AGNES LA GADINE AND RABINE PIDEBOU
WAS
IT NOT THE LEAST THAT ONE COULD DO TO SWEAR AT ONE'S EASE AND REVILE
THE NAME OF GOD A LITTLE ON SO FINE A DAY IN SUCH GOOD COMPANY AS
DIGNITARIES OF THE CHURCH AND LOOSE WOMEN SO THEY DID NOT ABSTAIN AND
IN THE MIDST OF THE UPROAR THERE WAS A FRIGHTFUL CONCERT OF BLASPHEMIES
AND ENORMITIES OF ALL THE UNBRIDLED TONGUES THE TONGUES OF CLERKS AND
STUDENTS RESTRAINED DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR BY THE FEAR OF THE HOT
IRON OF SAINT LOUIS
POOR SAINT LOUIS HOW THEY SET HIM AT DEFIANCE IN
HIS OWN COURT OF LAW EACH ONE OF THEM SELECTED FROM THE NEW COMERS ON
THE PLATFORM A BLACK GRAY WHITE OR VIOLET CASSOCK AS HIS TARGET
JOANNES FROLLO DE MOLENDIN IN HIS QUALITY OF BROTHER TO AN ARCHDEACON
BOLDLY ATTACKED THE SCARLET HE SANG IN DEAFENING TONES WITH HIS
IMPUDENT EYES FASTENED ON THE CARDINAL CAPPA REPLETA MERO
ALL THESE DETAILS WHICH WE HERE LAY BARE FOR THE EDIFICATION OF THE
READER WERE SO COVERED BY THE GENERAL UPROAR THAT THEY WERE LOST IN IT
BEFORE REACHING THE RESERVED PLATFORMS MOREOVER THEY WOULD HAVE
MOVED THE CARDINAL BUT LITTLE SO MUCH A PART OF THE CUSTOMS WERE THE
LIBERTIES OF THAT DAY
MOREOVER HE HAD ANOTHER CAUSE FOR SOLICITUDE
AND HIS MIEN AS WHOLLY PREOCCUPIED WITH IT WHICH ENTERED THE ESTRADE
THE SAME TIME AS HIMSELF THIS WAS THE EMBASSY FROM FLANDERS
NOT THAT HE WAS A PROFOUND POLITICIAN NOR WAS HE BORROWING TROUBLE
ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MARRIAGE OF HIS COUSIN MARGUERITE
DE BOURGOYNE TO HIS COUSIN CHARLES DAUPHIN DE VIENNE NOR AS TO HOW
LONG THE GOOD UNDERSTANDING WHICH HAD BEEN PATCHED UP BETWEEN THE
DUKE OF AUSTRIA AND THE KING OF FRANCE WOULD LAST NOR HOW THE KING OF
ENGLAND WOULD TAKE THIS DISDAIN OF HIS DAUGHTER
ALL THAT TROUBLED HIM
BUT LITTLE AND HE GAVE A WARM RECEPTION EVERY EVENING TO THE WINE OF
THE ROYAL VINTAGE OF CHAILLOT WITHOUT A SUSPICION THAT SEVERAL FLASKS
OF THAT SAME WINE SOMEWHAT REVISED AND CORRECTED IT IS TRUE BY DOCTOR
COICTIER CORDIALLY OFFERED TO EDWARD IV
BY LOUIS XI WOULD SOME
FINE MORNING RID LOUIS XI
OF EDWARD IV
THE MUCH HONORED EMBASSY OF
MONSIEUR THE DUKE OF AUSTRIA BROUGHT THE CARDINAL NONE OF THESE CARES
BUT IT TROUBLED HIM IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
IT WAS IN FACT SOMEWHAT
HARD AND WE HAVE ALREADY HINTED AT IT ON THE SECOND PAGE OF THIS
BOOK FOR HIM CHARLES DE BOURBON TO BE OBLIGED TO FEAST AND RECEIVE
CORDIALLY NO ONE KNOWS WHAT BOURGEOIS FOR HIM A CARDINAL TO RECEIVE
ALDERMEN FOR HIM A FRENCHMAN AND A JOLLY COMPANION TO RECEIVE
FLEMISH BEER DRINKERS AND THAT IN PUBLIC THIS WAS CERTAINLY ONE
OF THE MOST IRKSOME GRIMACES THAT HE HAD EVER EXECUTED FOR THE GOOD
PLEASURE OF THE KING
SO HE TURNED TOWARD THE DOOR AND WITH THE BEST GRACE IN THE WORLD
SO WELL HAD HE TRAINED HIMSELF TO IT WHEN THE USHER ANNOUNCED IN A
SONOROUS VOICE MESSIEURS THE ENVOYS OF MONSIEUR THE DUKE OF AUSTRIA
IT IS USELESS TO ADD THAT THE WHOLE HALL DID THE SAME
THEN ARRIVED TWO BY TWO WITH A GRAVITY WHICH MADE A CONTRAST IN THE
MIDST OF THE FRISKY ECCLESIASTICAL ESCORT OF CHARLES DE BOURBON THE
EIGHT AND FORTY AMBASSADORS OF MAXIMILIAN OF AUSTRIA HAVING AT
THEIR HEAD THE REVEREND FATHER IN GOD JEHAN ABBOT OF SAINT BERTIN
CHANCELLOR OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND JACQUES DE GOY SIEUR DAUBY GRAND
BAILIFF OF GHENT
A DEEP SILENCE SETTLED OVER THE ASSEMBLY ACCOMPANIED
BY STIFLED LAUGHTER AT THE PREPOSTEROUS NAMES AND ALL THE BOURGEOIS
DESIGNATIONS WHICH EACH OF THESE PERSONAGES TRANSMITTED WITH
IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY TO THE USHER WHO THEN TOSSED NAMES AND TITLES
PELL MELL AND MUTILATED TO THE CROWD BELOW
THERE WERE MASTER LOYS
ROELOF ALDERMAN OF THE CITY OF LOUVAIN MESSIRE CLAYS D'ETUELDE
ALDERMAN OF BRUSSELS MESSIRE PAUL DE BAEUST SIEUR DE VOIRMIZELLE
PRESIDENT OF FLANDERS MASTER JEHAN COLEGHENS BURGOMASTER OF THE CITY
OF ANTWERP MASTER GEORGE DE LA MOERE FIRST ALDERMAN OF THE KUERE OF
THE CITY OF GHENT MASTER GHELDOLF VAN DER HAGE FIRST ALDERMAN OF THE
PARCHOUS OF THE SAID TOWN AND THE SIEUR DE BIERBECQUE AND JEHAN
PINNOCK AND JEHAN DYMAERZELLE ETC ETC ETC BAILIFFS ALDERMEN
BURGOMASTERS BURGOMASTERS ALDERMEN BAILIFFS ALL STIFF AFFECTEDLY
GRAVE FORMAL DRESSED OUT IN VELVET AND DAMASK HOODED WITH CAPS OF
BLACK VELVET WITH GREAT TUFTS OF CYPRUS GOLD THREAD GOOD FLEMISH
HEADS AFTER ALL SEVERE AND WORTHY FACES OF THE FAMILY WHICH REMBRANDT
MAKES TO STAND OUT SO STRONG AND GRAVE FROM THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF HIS
NIGHT PATROL PERSONAGES ALL OF WHOM BORE WRITTEN ON THEIR BROWS
THAT MAXIMILIAN OF AUSTRIA HAD DONE WELL IN TRUSTING IMPLICITLY AS
THE MANIFEST RAN IN THEIR SENSE VALOR EXPERIENCE LOYALTY AND GOOD
WISDOM
THERE WAS ONE EXCEPTION HOWEVER
IT WAS A SUBTLE INTELLIGENT
CRAFTY LOOKING FACE A SORT OF COMBINED MONKEY AND DIPLOMAT PHIZ BEFORE
WHOM THE CARDINAL MADE THREE STEPS AND A PROFOUND BOW AND WHOSE NAME
NEVERTHELESS WAS ONLY GUILLAUME RYM COUNSELLOR AND PENSIONER OF THE
CITY OF GHENT
FEW PERSONS WERE THEN AWARE WHO GUILLAUME RYM WAS
A RARE GENIUS WHO
IN A TIME OF REVOLUTION WOULD HAVE MADE A BRILLIANT APPEARANCE ON THE
SURFACE OF EVENTS BUT WHO IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY WAS REDUCED TO
CAVERNOUS INTRIGUES AND TO LIVING IN MINES AS THE DUC DE SAINT SIMON
EXPRESSES IT
NEVERTHELESS HE WAS APPRECIATED BY THE MINER OF EUROPE
HE PLOTTED FAMILIARLY WITH LOUIS XI AND OFTEN LENT A HAND TO THE
KING'S SECRET JOBS
ALL WHICH THINGS WERE QUITE UNKNOWN TO THAT THRONG
WHO WERE AMAZED AT THE CARDINAL'S POLITENESS TO THAT FRAIL FIGURE OF A
FLEMISH BAILIFF
CHAPTER IV
MASTER JACQUES COPPENOLE
WHILE THE PENSIONER OF GHENT AND HIS EMINENCE WERE EXCHANGING VERY LOW
BOWS AND A FEW WORDS IN VOICES STILL LOWER A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE WITH
A LARGE FACE AND BROAD SHOULDERS PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER TO ENTER
ABREAST WITH GUILLAUME RYM ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HIM A BULL DOG BY
THE SIDE OF A FOX
HIS FELT DOUBLET AND LEATHER JERKIN MADE A SPOT ON
THE VELVET AND SILK WHICH SURROUNDED HIM
PRESUMING THAT HE WAS SOME
GROOM WHO HAD STOLEN IN THE USHER STOPPED HIM
HOLD MY FRIEND YOU CANNOT PASS
THE MAN IN THE LEATHER JERKIN SHOULDERED HIM ASIDE
WHAT DOES THIS KNAVE WANT WITH ME SAID HE IN STENTORIAN TONES WHICH
RENDERED THE ENTIRE HALL ATTENTIVE TO THIS STRANGE COLLOQUY
DON'T YOU
SEE THAT I AM ONE OF THEM
YOUR NAME DEMANDED THE USHER
JACQUES COPPENOLE
YOUR TITLES
HOSIER AT THE SIGN OF THE 'THREE LITTLE CHAINS OF GHENT
THE USHER RECOILED
ONE MIGHT BRING ONE'S SELF TO ANNOUNCE ALDERMEN AND
BURGOMASTERS BUT A HOSIER WAS TOO MUCH
THE CARDINAL WAS ON THORNS
ALL THE PEOPLE WERE STARING AND LISTENING
FOR TWO DAYS HIS EMINENCE HAD
BEEN EXERTING HIS UTMOST EFFORTS TO LICK THESE FLEMISH BEARS INTO SHAPE
AND TO RENDER THEM A LITTLE MORE PRESENTABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THIS
FREAK WAS STARTLING
BUT GUILLAUME RYM WITH HIS POLISHED SMILE
APPROACHED THE USHER
ANNOUNCE MASTER JACQUES COPPENOLE CLERK OF THE ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF
GHENT HE WHISPERED VERY LOW
USHER INTERPOSED THE CARDINAL ALOUD ANNOUNCE MASTER JACQUES
COPPENOLE CLERK OF THE ALDERMEN OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS CITY OF GHENT
THIS WAS A MISTAKE
GUILLAUME RYM ALONE MIGHT HAVE CONJURED AWAY THE
DIFFICULTY BUT COPPENOLE HAD HEARD THE CARDINAL
NO CROSS OF GOD HE EXCLAIMED IN HIS VOICE OF THUNDER JACQUES
COPPENOLE HOSIER
DO YOU HEAR USHER NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS
CROSS
OF GOD HOSIER THAT'S FINE ENOUGH
MONSIEUR THE ARCHDUKE HAS MORE THAN
ONCE SOUGHT HIS GANT IN MY HOSE
GOT THE FIRST IDEA OF A TIMING
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE BURST FORTH
A JEST IS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IN PARIS
AND CONSEQUENTLY ALWAYS APPLAUDED
LET US ADD THAT COPPENOLE WAS OF THE PEOPLE AND THAT THE AUDITORS WHICH
SURROUNDED HIM WERE ALSO OF THE PEOPLE
THUS THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN
HIM AND THEM HAD BEEN PROMPT ELECTRIC AND SO TO SPEAK ON A LEVEL
THE HAUGHTY AIR OF THE FLEMISH HOSIER BY HUMILIATING THE COURTIERS
HAD TOUCHED IN ALL THESE PLEBEIAN SOULS THAT LATENT SENTIMENT OF DIGNITY
STILL VAGUE AND INDISTINCT IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
THIS HOSIER WAS AN EQUAL WHO HAD JUST HELD HIS OWN BEFORE MONSIEUR THE
CARDINAL
A VERY SWEET REFLECTION TO POOR FELLOWS HABITUATED TO RESPECT
AND OBEDIENCE TOWARDS THE UNDERLINGS OF THE SERGEANTS OF THE BAILIFF OF
SAINTE GENEVIVE THE CARDINAL'S TRAIN BEARER
COPPENOLE PROUDLY SALUTED HIS EMINENCE WHO RETURNED THE SALUTE OF THE
ALL POWERFUL BOURGEOIS FEARED BY LOUIS XI
THEN WHILE GUILLAUME RYM A
SAGE AND MALICIOUS MAN AS PHILIPPE DE COMINES PUTS IT WATCHED THEM
BOTH WITH A SMILE OF RAILLERY AND SUPERIORITY EACH SOUGHT HIS PLACE
THE CARDINAL QUITE ABASHED AND TROUBLED COPPENOLE TRANQUIL AND HAUGHTY
AND THINKING NO DOUBT THAT HIS TITLE OF HOSIER WAS AS GOOD AS ANY
OTHER AFTER ALL AND THAT MARIE OF BURGUNDY MOTHER TO THAT MARGUERITE
WHOM COPPENOLE WAS TO DAY BESTOWING IN MARRIAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS
AFRAID OF THE CARDINAL THAN OF THE HOSIER FOR IT IS NOT A CARDINAL
WHO WOULD HAVE STIRRED UP A REVOLT AMONG THE MEN OF GHENT AGAINST THE
FAVORITES OF THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLES THE BOLD IT IS NOT A CARDINAL
WHO COULD HAVE FORTIFIED THE POPULACE WITH A WORD AGAINST HER TEARS
AND PRAYERS WHEN THE MAID OF FLANDERS CAME TO SUPPLICATE HER PEOPLE IN
THEIR BEHALF EVEN AT THE VERY FOOT OF THE SCAFFOLD WHILE THE HOSIER
HAD ONLY TO RAISE HIS LEATHER ELBOW IN ORDER TO CAUSE TO FALL YOUR
TWO HEADS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SEIGNEURS GUY D'HYMBERCOURT AND CHANCELLOR
GUILLAUME HUGONET
NEVERTHELESS ALL WAS OVER FOR THE POOR CARDINAL AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO
QUAFF TO THE DREGS THE BITTER CUP OF BEING IN SUCH B AD COMPANY
THE READER HAS PROBABLY NOT FORGOTTEN THE IMPUDENT BEGGAR WHO HAD BEEN
CLINGING FAST TO THE FRINGES OF THE CARDINAL'S GALLERY EVER SINCE THE
BEGINNING OF THE PROLOGUE
THE ARRIVAL OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS HAD
BY NO MEANS CAUSED HIM TO RELAX HIS HOLD AND WHILE THE PRELATES
AND AMBASSADORS WERE PACKING THEMSELVES INTO THE STALLS LIKE GENUINE
FLEMISH HERRINGS HE SETTLED HIMSELF AT HIS EASE AND BOLDLY CROSSED
HIS LEGS ON THE ARCHITRAVE
THE INSOLENCE OF THIS PROCEEDING WAS
EXTRAORDINARY YET NO ONE NOTICED IT AT FIRST THE ATTENTION OF ALL
BEING DIRECTED ELSEWHERE
HE ON HIS SIDE PERCEIVED NOTHING THAT
WAS GOING ON IN THE HALL HE WAGGED HIS HEAD WITH THE UNCONCERN OF A
NEAPOLITAN REPEATING FROM TIME TO TIME AMID THE CLAMOR AS FROM A
MECHANICAL HABIT CHARITY PLEASE AND ASSUREDLY HE WAS OUT OF ALL
THOSE PRESENT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD NOT DEIGNED TO TURN HIS HEAD AT THE
ALTERCATION BETWEEN COPPENOLE AND THE USHER
NOW CHANCE ORDAINED THAT
THE MASTER HOSIER OF GHENT WITH WHOM THE PEOPLE WERE ALREADY IN LIVELY
SYMPATHY AND UPON WHOM ALL EYES WERE RIVETED SHOULD COME AND SEAT
HIMSELF IN THE FRONT ROW OF THE GALLERY DIRECTLY ABOVE THE MENDICANT
AND PEOPLE WERE NOT A LITTLE AMAZED TO SEE THE FLEMISH AMBASSADOR ON
CONCLUDING HIS INSPECTION OF THE KNAVE THUS PLACED BENEATH HIS EYES
BESTOW A FRIENDLY TAP ON THAT RAGGED SHOULDER
THE BEGGAR TURNED ROUND
THERE WAS SURPRISE RECOGNITION A LIGHTING UP OF THE TWO COUNTENANCES
AND SO FORTH THEN WITHOUT PAYING THE SLIGHTEST HEED IN THE WORLD TO
THE SPECTATORS THE HOSIER AND THE WRETCHED BEING BEGAN TO CONVERSE IN A
LOW TONE HOLDING EACH OTHER'S HANDS IN THE MEANTIME WHILE THE RAGS
OF CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU SPREAD OUT UPON THE CLOTH OF GOLD OF THE DAIS
PRODUCED THE EFFECT OF A CATERPILLAR ON AN ORANGE
THE NOVELTY OF THIS SINGULAR SCENE EXCITED SUCH A MURMUR OF MIRTH AND
GAYETY IN THE HALL THAT THE CARDINAL WAS NOT SLOW TO PERCEIVE IT HE
HALF BENT FORWARD AND AS FROM THE POINT WHERE HE WAS PLACED HE COULD
CATCH ONLY AN IMPERFECT VIEW OF TROUILLERFOU'S IGNOMINIOUS DOUBLET
HE VERY NATURALLY IMAGINED THAT THE MENDICANT WAS ASKING ALMS AND
DISGUSTED WITH HIS AUDACITY HE EXCLAIMED BAILIFF OF THE COURTS TOSS
ME THAT KNAVE INTO THE RIVER
CROSS OF GOD MONSEIGNEUR THE CARDINAL SAID COPPENOLE WITHOUT
QUITTING CLOPIN'S HAND HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE
GOOD GOOD SHOUTED THE POPULACE
FROM THAT MOMENT MASTER COPPENOLE
ENJOYED IN PARIS AS IN GHENT GREAT FAVOR WITH THE PEOPLE FOR MEN OF
THAT SORT DO ENJOY IT SAYS PHILIPPE DE COMINES WHEN THEY ARE THUS
DISORDERLY THE CARDINAL BIT HIS LIPS
HE BENT TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBOR
THE ABB OF SAINT GENEVIVE AND SAID TO HIM IN A LOW TONE FINE
AMBASSADORS MONSIEUR THE ARCHDUKE SENDS HERE TO ANNOUNCE TO US MADAME
MARGUERITE
YOUR EMINENCE REPLIED THE ABB WASTES YOUR POLITENESS ON THESE
FLEMISH SWINE
MARGARITAS ANTE PORCOS PEARLS BEFORE SWINE
SAY RATHER RETORTED THE CARDINAL WITH A SMILE PORCOS ANTE
MARGARITAM SWINE BEFORE THE PEARL
THE WHOLE LITTLE COURT IN CASSOCKS WENT INTO ECSTACIES OVER THIS PLAY
UPON WORDS
THE CARDINAL FELT A LITTLE RELIEVED HE WAS QUITS WITH
COPPENOLE HE ALSO HAD HAD HIS JEST APPLAUDED
NOW WILL THOSE OF OUR READERS WHO POSSESS THE POWER OF GENERALIZING AN
IMAGE OR AN IDEA AS THE EXPRESSION RUNS IN THE STYLE OF TO DAY PERMIT
US TO ASK THEM IF THEY HAVE FORMED A VERY CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THE
SPECTACLE PRESENTED AT THIS MOMENT UPON WHICH WE HAVE ARRESTED THEIR
ATTENTION BY THE VAST PARALLELOGRAM OF THE GRAND HALL OF THE PALACE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL BACKED AGAINST THE WESTERN WALL A LARGE
AND MAGNIFICENT GALLERY DRAPED WITH CLOTH OF GOLD INTO WHICH ENTER IN
PROCESSION THROUGH A SMALL ARCHED DOOR GRAVE PERSONAGES ANNOUNCED
SUCCESSIVELY BY THE SHRILL VOICE OF AN USHER
ON THE FRONT BENCHES WERE
ALREADY A NUMBER OF VENERABLE FIGURES MUFFLED IN ERMINE VELVET AND
SCARLET
AROUND THE DAIS WHICH REMAINS SILENT AND DIGNIFIED BELOW
OPPOSITE EVERYWHERE A GREAT CROWD AND A GREAT MURMUR
THOUSANDS OF
GLANCES DIRECTED BY THE PEOPLE ON EACH FACE UPON THE DAIS A THOUSAND
WHISPERS OVER EACH NAME
CERTAINLY THE SPECTACLE IS CURIOUS AND WELL
DESERVES THE ATTENTION OF THE SPECTATORS
BUT YONDER QUITE AT THE END
WHAT IS THAT SORT OF TRESTLE WORK WITH FOUR MOTLEY PUPPETS UPON IT AND
MORE BELOW WHO IS THAT MAN BESIDE THE TRESTLE WITH A BLACK DOUBLET
AND A PALE FACE ALAS MY DEAR READER IT IS PIERRE GRINGOIRE AND HIS
PROLOGUE
WE HAVE ALL FORGOTTEN HIM COMPLETELY
THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HE FEARED
FROM THE MOMENT OF THE CARDINAL'S ENTRANCE GRINGOIRE HAD NEVER CEASED
TO TREMBLE FOR THE SAFETY OF HIS PROLOGUE
AT FIRST HE HAD ENJOINED THE
ACTORS WHO HAD STOPPED IN SUSPENSE TO CONTINUE AND TO RAISE THEIR
VOICES THEN PERCEIVING THAT NO ONE WAS LISTENING HE HAD STOPPED THEM
AND DURING THE ENTIRE QUARTER OF AN HOUR THAT THE INTERRUPTION LASTED
HE HAD NOT CEASED TO STAMP TO FLOUNCE ABOUT TO APPEAL TO GISQUETTE AND
LINARDE AND TO URGE HIS NEIGHBORS TO THE CONTINUANCE OF THE PROLOGUE
ALL IN VAIN
NO ONE QUITTED THE CARDINAL THE EMBASSY AND THE
GALLERY SOLE CENTRE OF THIS VAST CIRCLE OF VISUAL RAYS
WE MUST ALSO
BELIEVE AND WE SAY IT WITH REGRET THAT THE PROLOGUE HAD BEGUN SLIGHTLY
TO WEARY THE AUDIENCE AT THE MOMENT WHEN HIS EMINENCE HAD ARRIVED AND
CREATED A DIVERSION IN SO TERRIBLE A FASHION
AFTER ALL ON THE GALLERY
AS WELL AS ON THE MARBLE TABLE THE SPECTACLE WAS THE SAME THE CONFLICT
OF LABOR AND CLERGY OF NOBILITY AND MERCHANDISE
AND MANY PEOPLE
PREFERRED TO SEE THEM ALIVE BREATHING MOVING ELBOWING EACH OTHER IN
FLESH AND BLOOD IN THIS FLEMISH EMBASSY IN THIS EPISCOPAL COURT UNDER
THE CARDINAL'S ROBE UNDER COPPENOLE'S JERKIN THAN PAINTED DECKED
OUT TALKING IN VERSE AND SO TO SPEAK STUFFED BENEATH THE YELLOW AMID
WHITE TUNICS IN WHICH GRINGOIRE HAD SO RIDICULOUSLY CLOTHED THEM
NEVERTHELESS WHEN OUR POET BEHELD QUIET REESTABLISHED TO SOME EXTENT
HE DEVISED A STRATAGEM WHICH MIGHT HAVE REDEEMED ALL
MONSIEUR HE SAID TURNING TOWARDS ONE OF HIS NEIGHBORS A FINE BIG
MAN WITH A PATIENT FACE SUPPOSE WE BEGIN AGAIN
WHAT SAID HIS NEIGHBOR
H THE MYSTERY SAID GRINGOIRE
AS YOU LIKE RETURNED HIS NEIGHBOR
THIS SEMI APPROBATION SUFFICED FOR GRINGOIRE AND CONDUCTING HIS OWN
AFFAIRS HE BEGAN TO SHOUT CONFOUNDING HIMSELF WITH THE CROWD AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE BEGIN THE MYSTERY AGAIN BEGIN AGAIN
THE DEVIL SAID JOANNES DE MOLENDINO WHAT ARE THEY JABBERING DOWN
YONDER AT THE END OF THE HALL FOR GRINGOIRE WAS MAKING NOISE ENOUGH
FOR FOUR SAY COMRADES ISN'T THAT MYSTERY FINISHED THEY WANT TO
BEGIN IT ALL OVER AGAIN
THAT'S NOT FAIR
NO NO SHOUTED ALL THE SCHOLARS
DOWN WITH THE MYSTERY DOWN WITH
IT
BUT GRINGOIRE HAD MULTIPLIED HIMSELF AND ONLY SHOUTED THE MORE
VIGOROUSLY BEGIN AGAIN BEGIN AGAIN
THESE CLAMORS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE CARDINAL
MONSIEUR BAILIFF OF THE COURTS SAID HE TO A TALL BLACK MAN PLACED A
FEW PACES FROM HIM ARE THOSE KNAVES IN A HOLY WATER VESSEL THAT THEY
MAKE SUCH A HELLISH NOISE
THE BAILIFF OF THE COURTS WAS A SORT OF AMPHIBIOUS MAGISTRATE A SORT
OF BAT OF THE JUDICIAL ORDER RELATED TO BOTH THE RAT AND THE BIRD THE
JUDGE AND THE SOLDIER
HE APPROACHED HIS EMINENCE AND NOT WITHOUT A GOOD DEAL OF FEAR OF
THE LATTER'S DISPLEASURE HE AWKWARDLY EXPLAINED TO HIM THE SEEMING
DISRESPECT OF THE AUDIENCE THAT NOONDAY HAD ARRIVED BEFORE HIS
EMINENCE AND THAT THE COMEDIANS HAD BEEN FORCED TO BEGIN WITHOUT
WAITING FOR HIS EMINENCE
THE CARDINAL BURST INTO A LAUGH
ON MY FAITH THE RECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE THE SAME
WHAT SAY YOU MASTER GUILLAUME RYM
MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED GUILLAUME RYM LET US BE CONTENT WITH HAVING
ESCAPED HALF OF THE COMEDY
THERE IS AT LEAST THAT MUCH GAINED
CAN THESE RASCALS CONTINUE THEIR FARCE ASKED THE BAILIFF
CONTINUE CONTINUE SAID THE CARDINAL IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME
I'LL
READ MY BREVIARY IN THE MEANTIME
THE BAILIFF ADVANCED TO THE EDGE OF THE ESTRADE AND CRIED AFTER HAVING
INVOKED SILENCE BY A WAVE OF THE HAND
BOURGEOIS RUSTICS AND CITIZENS IN ORDER TO SATISFY THOSE WHO WISH
THE PLAY TO BEGIN AGAIN AND THOSE WHO WISH IT TO END HIS EMINENCE
ORDERS THAT IT BE CONTINUED
BOTH PARTIES WERE FORCED TO RESIGN THEMSELVES
BUT THE PUBLIC AND THE
AUTHOR LONG CHERISHED A GRUDGE AGAINST THE CARDINAL
SO THE PERSONAGES ON THE STAGE TOOK UP THEIR PARTS AND GRINGOIRE HOPED
THAT THE REST OF HIS WORK AT LEAST WOULD BE LISTENED TO
THIS HOPE WAS
SPEEDILY DISPELLED LIKE HIS OTHER ILLUSIONS SILENCE HAD INDEED
BEEN RESTORED IN THE AUDIENCE AFTER A FASHION BUT GRINGOIRE HAD
NOT OBSERVED THAT AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE CARDINAL GAVE THE ORDER TO
CONTINUE THE GALLERY WAS FAR FROM FULL AND THAT AFTER THE FLEMISH
ENVOYS THERE HAD ARRIVED NEW PERSONAGES FORMING PART OF THE CORTEGE
WHOSE NAMES AND RANKS SHOUTED OUT IN THE MIDST OF HIS DIALOGUE BY THE
INTERMITTENT CRY OF THE USHER PRODUCED CONSIDERABLE RAVAGES IN IT
LET
THE READER IMAGINE THE EFFECT IN THE MIDST OF A THEATRICAL PIECE OF THE
YELPING OF AN USHER FLINGING IN BETWEEN TWO RHYMES AND OFTEN IN THE
MIDDLE OF A LINE PARENTHESES LIKE THE FOLLOWING
MASTER JACQUES CHARMOLUE PROCURATOR TO THE KING IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL
COURTS
JEHAN DE HARLAY EQUERRY GUARDIAN OF THE OFFICE OF CHEVALIER OF THE
NIGHT WATCH OF THE CITY OF PARIS
MESSIRE GALIOT DE GENOILHAC CHEVALIER SEIGNEUR DE BRUSSAC MASTER OF
THE KING'S ARTILLERY
MASTER DREUX RAGUIER SURVEYOR OF THE WOODS AND FORESTS OF THE KING OUR
SOVEREIGN IN THE LAND OF FRANCE CHAMPAGNE AND BRIE
MESSIRE LOUIS DE GRAVILLE CHEVALIER COUNCILLOR AND CHAMBERLAIN OF
THE KING ADMIRAL OF FRANCE KEEPER OF THE FOREST OF VINCENNES
MASTER DENIS LE MERCIER GUARDIAN OF THE HOUSE OF THE BLIND AT PARIS
ETC ETC ETC
THIS WAS BECOMING UNBEARABLE
THIS STRANGE ACCOMPANIMENT WHICH RENDERED IT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW
THE PIECE MADE GRINGOIRE ALL THE MORE INDIGNANT BECAUSE HE COULD
NOT CONCEAL FROM HIMSELF THE FACT THAT THE INTEREST WAS CONTINUALLY
INCREASING AND THAT ALL HIS WORK REQUIRED WAS A CHANCE OF BEING HEARD
IT WAS IN FACT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A MORE INGENIOUS AND MORE
DRAMATIC COMPOSITION
THE FOUR PERSONAGES OF THE PROLOGUE WERE BEWAILING
THEMSELVES IN THEIR MORTAL EMBARRASSMENT WHEN VENUS IN PERSON VERA
INCESSA PATUIT DEA PRESENTED HERSELF TO THEM CLAD IN A FINE ROBE
BEARING THE HERALDIC DEVICE OF THE SHIP OF THE CITY OF PARIS
SHE
HAD COME HERSELF TO CLAIM THE DOLPHIN PROMISED TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
JUPITER WHOSE THUNDER COULD BE HEARD RUMBLING IN THE DRESSING ROOM
SUPPORTED HER CLAIM AND VENUS WAS ON THE POINT OF CARRYING IT
OFF THAT IS TO SAY WITHOUT ALLEGORY OF MARRYING MONSIEUR THE
DAUPHIN WHEN A YOUNG CHILD CLAD IN WHITE DAMASK AND HOLDING IN HER
HAND A DAISY A TRANSPARENT PERSONIFICATION OF MADEMOISELLE MARGUERITE
OF FLANDERS CAME TO CONTEST IT WITH VENUS
THEATRICAL EFFECT AND CHANGE
AFTER A DISPUTE VENUS MARGUERITE AND THE ASSISTANTS AGREED TO SUBMIT
TO THE GOOD JUDGMENT OF TIME HOLY VIRGIN
THERE WAS ANOTHER GOOD PART
THAT OF THE KING OF MESOPOTAMIA BUT THROUGH SO MANY INTERRUPTIONS
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT WHAT END HE SERVED
ALL THESE PERSONS HAD
ASCENDED BY THE LADDER TO THE STAGE
BUT ALL WAS OVER NONE OF THESE BEAUTIES HAD BEEN FELT NOR UNDERSTOOD
ON THE ENTRANCE OF THE CARDINAL ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT AN INVISIBLE
MAGIC THREAD HAD SUDDENLY DRAWN ALL GLANCES FROM THE MARBLE TABLE TO THE
GALLERY FROM THE SOUTHERN TO THE WESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE HALL
NOTHING
COULD DISENCHANT THE AUDIENCE ALL EYES REMAINED FIXED THERE AND
THE NEW COMERS AND THEIR ACCURSED NAMES AND THEIR FACES AND THEIR
COSTUMES AFFORDED A CONTINUAL DIVERSION
THIS WAS VERY DISTRESSING
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GISQUETTE AND LINARDE WHO TURNED ROUND FROM TIME
TO TIME WHEN GRINGOIRE PLUCKED THEM BY THE SLEEVE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
THE BIG PATIENT NEIGHBOR NO ONE LISTENED NO ONE LOOKED AT THE POOR
DESERTED MORALITY FULL FACE
GRINGOIRE SAW ONLY PROFILES
WITH WHAT BITTERNESS DID HE BEHOLD HIS WHOLE ERECTION OF GLORY AND OF
POETRY CRUMBLE AWAY BIT BY BIT AND TO THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE HAD
BEEN UPON THE POINT OF INSTITUTING A REVOLT AGAINST THE BAILIFF THROUGH
IMPATIENCE TO HEAR HIS WORK NOW THAT THEY HAD IT THEY DID NOT CARE FOR
IT
THIS SAME REPRESENTATION WHICH HAD BEEN BEGUN AMID SO UNANIMOUS AN
ACCLAMATION ETERNAL FLOOD AND EBB OF POPULAR FAVOR TO THINK THAT THEY
HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF HANGING THE BAILIFF'S SERGEANT WHAT WOULD HE
NOT HAVE GIVEN TO BE STILL AT THAT HOUR OF HONEY
BUT THE USHER'S BRUTAL MONOLOGUE CAME TO AN END EVERY ONE HAD ARRIVED
AND GRINGOIRE BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE THE ACTORS CONTINUED BRAVELY
BUT MASTER COPPENOLE THE HOSIER MUST NEEDS RISE OF A SUDDEN AND
GRINGOIRE WAS FORCED TO LISTEN TO HIM DELIVER AMID UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
THE FOLLOWING ABOMINABLE HARANGUE
MESSIEURS THE BOURGEOIS AND SQUIRES OF PARIS I DON'T KNOW CROSS OF
GOD WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE
I CERTAINLY DO SEE YONDER IN THE CORNER ON
THAT STAGE SOME PEOPLE WHO APPEAR TO BE FIGHTING
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL A MYSTERY BUT IT IS NOT AMUSING THEY QUARREL
WITH THEIR TONGUES AND NOTHING MORE
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE FIRST
BLOW THIS QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOTHING COMES THEY ARE COWARDS WHO ONLY
SCRATCH EACH OTHER WITH INSULTS
YOU OUGHT TO SEND FOR THE FIGHTERS OF
LONDON OR ROTTERDAM AND I CAN TELL YOU YOU WOULD HAVE HAD BLOWS OF
THE FIST THAT COULD BE HEARD IN THE PLACE BUT THESE MEN EXCITE OUR
PITY
THEY OUGHT AT LEAST TO GIVE US A MOORISH DANCE OR SOME OTHER
MUMMER THAT IS NOT WHAT WAS TOLD ME I WAS PROMISED A FEAST OF FOOLS
WITH THE ELECTION OF A POPE
WE HAVE OUR POPE OF FOOLS AT GHENT ALSO
WE'RE NOT BEHINDHAND IN THAT CROSS OF GOD BUT THIS IS THE WAY WE
MANAGE IT WE COLLECT A CROWD LIKE THIS ONE HERE THEN EACH PERSON IN
TURN PASSES HIS HEAD THROUGH A HOLE AND MAKES A GRIMACE AT THE REST
TIME ONE WHO MAKES THE UGLIEST IS ELECTED POPE BY GENERAL ACCLAMATION
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
IT IS VERY DIVERTING
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE YOUR
POPE AFTER THE FASHION OF MY COUNTRY AT ALL EVENTS IT WILL BE LESS
WEARISOME THAN TO LISTEN TO CHATTERERS
IF THEY WISH TO COME AND MAKE
THEIR GRIMACES THROUGH THE HOLE THEY CAN JOIN THE GAME
WHAT SAY YOU
MESSIEURS LES BOURGEOIS YOU HAVE HERE ENOUGH GROTESQUE SPECIMENS OF
BOTH SEXES TO ALLOW OF LAUGHING IN FLEMISH FASHION AND THERE ARE
ENOUGH OF US UGLY IN COUNTENANCE TO HOPE FOR A FINE GRINNING MATCH
GRINGOIRE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO RETORT STUPEFACTION RAGE INDIGNATION
DEPRIVED HIM OF WORDS
MOREOVER THE SUGGESTION OF THE POPULAR HOSIER
WAS RECEIVED WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM BY THESE BOURGEOIS WHO WERE FLATTERED
AT BEING CALLED SQUIRES THAT ALL RESISTANCE WAS USELESS
THERE WAS
NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO ALLOW ONE'S SELF TO DRIFT WITH THE TORRENT
GRINGOIRE HID HIS FACE BETWEEN HIS TWO HANDS NOT BEING SO FORTUNATE
AS TO HAVE A MANTLE WITH WHICH TO VEIL HIS HEAD LIKE AGAMEMNON OF
TIMANTIS
CHAPTER V
QUASIMODO
IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE ALL WAS READY TO EXECUTE COPPENOLE'S IDEA
BOURGEOIS SCHOLARS AND LAW CLERKS ALL SET TO WORK
THE LITTLE CHAPEL
SITUATED OPPOSITE THE MARBLE TABLE WAS SELECTED FOR THE SCENE OF THE
GRINNING MATCH
A PANE BROKEN IN THE PRETTY ROSE WINDOW ABOVE THE
DOOR LEFT FREE A CIRCLE OF STONE THROUGH WHICH IT WAS AGREED THAT THE
COMPETITORS SHOULD THRUST THEIR HEADS
IN ORDER TO REACH IT IT WAS ONLY
NECESSARY TO MOUNT UPON A COUPLE OF HOGSHEADS WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED
FROM I KNOW NOT WHERE AND PERCHED ONE UPON THE OTHER AFTER A FASHION
IT WAS SETTLED THAT EACH CANDIDATE MAN OR WOMAN FOR IT WAS POSSIBLE TO
CHOOSE A FEMALE POPE SHOULD FOR THE SAKE OF LEAVING THE IMPRESSION OF
HIS GRIMACE FRESH AND COMPLETE COVER HIS FACE AND REMAIN CONCEALED IN
THE CHAPEL UNTIL THE MOMENT OF HIS APPEARANCE
IN LESS THAN AN INSTANT
THE CHAPEL WAS CROWDED WITH COMPETITORS UPON WHOM THE DOOR WAS THEN
CLOSED
COPPENOLE FROM HIS POST ORDERED ALL DIRECTED ALL ARRANGED ALL
DURING THE UPROAR THE CARDINAL NO LESS ABASHED THAN GRINGOIRE HAD
RETIRED WITH ALL HIS SUITE UNDER THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS AND VESPERS
WITHOUT THE CROWD WHICH HIS ARRIVAL HAD SO DEEPLY STIRRED BEING IN THE
LEAST MOVED BY HIS DEPARTURE
GUILLAUME RYM WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED
HIS EMINENCE'S DISCOMFITURE
THE ATTENTION OF THE POPULACE LIKE THE
SUN PURSUED ITS REVOLUTION HAVING SET OUT FROM ONE END OF THE HALL
AND HALTED FOR A SPACE IN THE MIDDLE IT HAD NOW REACHED THE OTHER END
THE MARBLE TABLE THE BROCADED GALLERY HAD EACH HAD THEIR DAY IT WAS
NOW THE TURN OF THE CHAPEL OF LOUIS XI
HENCEFORTH THE FIELD WAS OPEN
TO ALL FOLLY
THERE WAS NO ONE THERE NOW BUT THE FLEMINGS AND THE
RABBLE
THE GRIMACES BEGAN
THE FIRST FACE WHICH APPEARED AT THE APERTURE
WITH EYELIDS TURNED UP TO THE REDS A MOUTH OPEN LIKE A MAW AND A
BROW WRINKLED LIKE OUR HUSSAR BOOTS OF THE EMPIRE EVOKED SUCH AN
INEXTINGUISHABLE PEAL OF LAUGHTER THAT HOMER WOULD HAVE TAKEN ALL THESE
LOUTS FOR GODS
NEVERTHELESS THE GRAND HALL WAS ANYTHING BUT OLYMPUS
AND GRINGOIRE'S POOR JUPITER KNEW IT BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE
A SECOND
AND THIRD GRIMACE FOLLOWED THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND THE LAUGHTER
AND TRANSPORTS OF DELIGHT WENT ON INCREASING
THERE WAS IN THIS
SPECTACLE A PECULIAR POWER OF INTOXICATION AND FASCINATION OF WHICH IT
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONVEY TO THE READER OF OUR DAY AND OUR SALONS ANY
IDEA
LET THE READER PICTURE TO HIMSELF A SERIES OF VISAGES PRESENTING
SUCCESSIVELY ALL GEOMETRICAL FORMS FROM THE TRIANGLE TO THE TRAPEZIUM
FROM THE CONE TO THE POLYHEDRON ALL HUMAN EXPRESSIONS FROM WRATH
TO LEWDNESS ALL AGES FROM THE WRINKLES OF THE NEW BORN BABE TO THE
WRINKLES OF THE AGED AND DYING ALL RELIGIOUS PHANTASMAGORIES FROM FAUN
TO BEELZEBUB ALL ANIMAL PROFILES FROM THE MAW TO THE BEAK FROM THE
JOWL TO THE MUZZLE
LET THE READER IMAGINE ALL THESE GROTESQUE FIGURES
OF THE PONT NEUF THOSE NIGHTMARES PETRIFIED BENEATH THE HAND OF GERMAIN
PILON ASSUMING LIFE AND BREATH AND COMING IN TURN TO STARE YOU IN THE
FACE WITH BURNING EYES ALL THE MASKS OF THE CARNIVAL OF VENICE PASSING
IN SUCCESSION BEFORE YOUR GLASS IN A WORD A HUMAN KALEIDOSCOPE
THE ORGY GREW MORE AND MORE FLEMISH
TENIERS COULD HAVE GIVEN BUT A VERY
IMPERFECT IDEA OF IT
LET THE READER PICTURE TO HIMSELF IN BACCHANAL
FORM SALVATOR ROSA'S BATTLE
THERE WERE NO LONGER EITHER SCHOLARS OR
AMBASSADORS OR BOURGEOIS OR MEN OR WOMEN THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY CLOPIN
TROUILLEFOU NOR GILLES LECORNU NOR MARIE QUATRELIVRES NOR ROBIN
POUSSEPAIN
ALL WAS UNIVERSAL LICENSE
THE GRAND HALL WAS NO LONGER
ANYTHING BUT A VAST FURNACE OF EFFRONTRY AND JOVIALITY WHERE EVERY
MOUTH WAS A CRY EVERY INDIVIDUAL A POSTURE EVERYTHING SHOUTED AND
HOWLED
THE STRANGE VISAGES WHICH CAME IN TURN TO GNASH THEIR TEETH
IN THE ROSE WINDOW WERE LIKE SO MANY BRANDS CAST INTO THE BRAZIER
AND FROM THE WHOLE OF THIS EFFERVESCING CROWD THERE ESCAPED AS FROM A
FURNACE A SHARP PIERCING STINGING NOISE HISSING LIKE THE WINGS OF A
GNAT
HO H CURSE IT
JUST LOOK AT THAT FACE
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYTHING
GUILLEMETTE MAUGEREPUIS JUST LOOK AT THAT BULL'S MUZZLE IT ONLY LACKS
THE HORNS
IT CAN'T BE YOUR HUSBAND
ANOTHER
BELLY OF THE POPE WHAT SORT OF A GRIMACE IS THAT
HOLA H THAT'S CHEATING
ONE MUST SHOW ONLY ONE'S FACE
THAT DAMNED PERRETTE CALLEBOTTE SHE'S CAPABLE OF THAT
GOOD GOOD
I'M STIFLING
THERE'S A FELLOW WHOSE EARS WON'T GO THROUGH ETC ETC
BUT WE MUST DO JUSTICE TO OUR FRIEND JEHAN
IN THE MIDST OF THIS
WITCHES' SABBATH HE WAS STILL TO BE SEEN ON THE TOP OF HIS PILLAR LIKE
THE CABIN BOY ON THE TOPMAST
HE FLOUNDERED ABOUT WITH INCREDIBLE FURY
HIS MOUTH WAS WIDE OPEN AND FROM IT THERE ESCAPED A CRY WHICH NO ONE
HEARD NOT THAT IT WAS COVERED BY THE GENERAL CLAMOR GREAT AS THAT
WAS BUT BECAUSE IT ATTAINED NO DOUBT THE LIMIT OF PERCEPTIBLE SHARP
SOUNDS THE THOUSAND VIBRATIONS OF SAUVEUR OR THE EIGHT THOUSAND OF
BIOT
AS FOR GRINGOIRE THE FIRST MOMENT OF DEPRESSION HAVING PASSED HE
HAD REGAINED HIS COMPOSURE
HE HAD HARDENED HIMSELF AGAINST
ADVERSITY CONTINUE HE HAD SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME TO HIS
COMEDIANS SPEAKING MACHINES THEN AS HE WAS MARCHING WITH GREAT STRIDES
IN FRONT OF THE MARBLE TABLE A FANCY SEIZED HIM TO GO AND APPEAR IN
HIS TURN AT THE APERTURE OF THE CHAPEL WERE IT ONLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF
MAKING A GRIMACE AT THAT UNGRATEFUL POPULACE BUT NO THAT WOULD
NOT BE WORTHY OF US NO VENGEANCE LET US COMBAT UNTIL THE END HE
REPEATED TO HIMSELF THE POWER OF POETRY OVER PEOPLE IS GREAT I WILL
BRING THEM BACK
WE SHALL SEE WHICH WILL CARRY THE DAY GRIMACES OR
POLITE LITERATURE
ALAS HE HAD BEEN LEFT THE SOLE SPECTATOR OF HIS PIECE
IT WAS FAR WORSE
THAN IT HAD BEEN A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE
HE NO LONGER BEHELD ANYTHING BUT
BACKS
I AM MISTAKEN
THE BIG PATIENT MAN WHOM HE HAD ALREADY CONSULTED IN A
CRITICAL MOMENT HAD REMAINED WITH HIS FACE TURNED TOWARDS THE STAGE
AS
FOR GISQUETTE AND LINARDE THEY HAD DESERTED HIM LONG AGO
GRINGOIRE WAS TOUCHED TO THE HEART BY THE FIDELITY OF HIS ONLY
SPECTATOR
HE APPROACHED HIM AND ADDRESSED HIM SHAKING HIS ARM
SLIGHTLY FOR THE GOOD MAN WAS LEANING ON THE BALUSTRADE AND DOZING A
LITTLE
MONSIEUR SAID GRINGOIRE I THANK YOU
MONSIEUR REPLIED THE BIG MAN WITH A YAWN FOR WHAT
I SEE WHAT WEARIES YOU RESUMED THE POET 'TIS ALL THIS NOISE WHICH
PREVENTS YOUR HEARING COMFORTABLY
BUT BE AT EASE YOUR NAME SHALL
DESCEND TO POSTERITY YOUR NAME IF YOU PLEASE
RENAULD CHATEAU GUARDIAN OF THE SEALS OF THE CHTELET OF PARIS AT
YOUR SERVICE
MONSIEUR YOU ARE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MUSES HERE SAID
GRINGOIRE
YOU ARE TOO KIND SIR SAID THE GUARDIAN OF THE SEALS AT THE CHTELET
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE RESUMED GRINGOIRE WHO HAS LISTENED TO THE
PIECE DECOROUSLY
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT
HE HE REPLIED THE FAT MAGISTRATE HALF AROUSED IT'S TOLERABLY
JOLLY THAT'S A FACT
GRINGOIRE WAS FORCED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THIS EULOGY FOR A
THUNDER OF APPLAUSE MINGLED WITH A PRODIGIOUS ACCLAMATION CUT THEIR
CONVERSATION SHORT
THE POPE OF THE FOOLS HAD BEEN ELECTED
NOEL NOEL NOEL SHOUTED THE PEOPLE ON ALL SIDES
THAT WAS IN
FACT A MARVELLOUS GRIMACE WHICH WAS BEAMING AT THAT MOMENT THROUGH THE
APERTURE IN THE ROSE WINDOW
AFTER ALL THE PENTAGONAL HEXAGONAL AND
WHIMSICAL FACES WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER AT THAT HOLE WITHOUT
REALIZING THE IDEAL OF THE GROTESQUE WHICH THEIR IMAGINATIONS EXCITED
BY THE ORGY HAD CONSTRUCTED NOTHING LESS WAS NEEDED TO WIN THEIR
SUFFRAGES THAN THE SUBLIME GRIMACE WHICH HAD JUST DAZZLED THE ASSEMBLY
MASTER COPPENOLE HIMSELF APPLAUDED AND CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU WHO HAD
BEEN AMONG THE COMPETITORS AND GOD KNOWS WHAT INTENSITY OF UGLINESS HIS
VISAGE COULD ATTAIN CONFESSED HIMSELF CONQUERED WE WILL DO THE SAME
WE SHALL NOT TRY TO GIVE THE READER AN IDEA OF THAT TETRAHEDRAL NOSE
THAT HORSESHOE MOUTH THAT LITTLE LEFT EYE OBSTRUCTED WITH A RED BUSHY
BRISTLING EYEBROW WHILE THE RIGHT EYE DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY BENEATH AN
ENORMOUS WART OF THOSE TEETH IN DISARRAY BROKEN HERE AND THERE LIKE
THE EMBATTLED PARAPET OF A FORTRESS OF THAT CALLOUS LIP UPON WHICH ONE
OF THESE TEETH ENCROACHED LIKE THE TUSK OF AN ELEPHANT OF THAT FORKED
CHIN AND ABOVE ALL OF THE EXPRESSION SPREAD OVER THE WHOLE OF THAT
MIXTURE OF MALICE AMAZEMENT AND SADNESS
LET THE READER DREAM OF THIS
WHOLE IF HE CAN
THE ANCIENT FRENCH HURRAH
THE ACCLAMATION WAS UNANIMOUS PEOPLE RUSHED TOWARDS THE CHAPEL
THEY
MADE THE LUCKY POPE OF THE FOOLS COME FORTH IN TRIUMPH
BUT IT WAS THEN
THAT SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION ATTAINED THEIR HIGHEST PITCH THE GRIMACE
WAS HIS FACE
OR RATHER HIS WHOLE PERSON WAS A GRIMACE
A HUGE HEAD BRISTLING
WITH RED HAIR BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS AN ENORMOUS HUMP A COUNTERPART
PERCEPTIBLE IN FRONT A SYSTEM OF THIGHS AND LEGS SO STRANGELY ASTRAY
THAT THEY COULD TOUCH EACH OTHER ONLY AT THE KNEES AND VIEWED FROM
THE FRONT RESEMBLED THE CRESCENTS OF TWO SCYTHES JOINED BY THE
HANDLES LARGE FEET MONSTROUS HANDS AND WITH ALL THIS DEFORMITY
AN INDESCRIBABLE AND REDOUBTABLE AIR OF VIGOR AGILITY AND
COURAGE STRANGE EXCEPTION TO THE ETERNAL RULE WHICH WILLS THAT FORCE
AS WELL AS BEAUTY SHALL BE THE RESULT OF HARMONY
SUCH WAS THE POPE WHOM
THE FOOLS HAD JUST CHOSEN FOR THEMSELVES
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HIM A GIANT WHO HAD BEEN BROKEN AND BADLY PUT
TOGETHER AGAIN
WHEN THIS SPECIES OF CYCLOPS APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE CHAPEL
MOTIONLESS SQUAT AND ALMOST AS BROAD AS HE WAS TALL SQUARED ON THE
BASE AS A GREAT MAN SAYS WITH HIS DOUBLET HALF RED HALF VIOLET SOWN
WITH SILVER BELLS AND ABOVE ALL IN THE PERFECTION OF HIS UGLINESS
THE POPULACE RECOGNIZED HIM ON THE INSTANT AND SHOUTED WITH ONE
VOICE
'TIS QUASIMODO THE BELLRINGER 'TIS QUASIMODO THE HUNCHBACK OF
NOTRE DAME QUASIMODO THE ONE EYED QUASIMODO THE BANDY LEGGED NOEL
NOEL
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE POOR FELLOW HAD A CHOICE OF SURNAMES
LET THE WOMEN WITH CHILD BEWARE SHOUTED THE SCHOLARS
OR THOSE WHO WISH TO BE RESUMED JOANNES
THE WOMEN DID IN FACT HIDE THEIR FACES
OH THE HORRIBLE MONKEY SAID ONE OF THEM
AS WICKED AS HE IS UGLY RETORTED ANOTHER
HE'S THE DEVIL ADDED A THIRD
I HAVE THE MISFORTUNE TO LIVE NEAR NOTRE DAME I HEAR HIM PROWLING
ROUND THE EAVES BY NIGHT
WITH THE CATS
HE'S ALWAYS ON OUR ROOFS
HE THROWS SPELLS DOWN OUR CHIMNEYS
THE OTHER EVENING HE CAME AND MADE A GRIMACE AT ME THROUGH MY ATTIC
WINDOW
I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A MAN
SUCH A FRIGHT AS I HAD
I'M SURE THAT HE GOES TO THE WITCHES' SABBATH
ONCE HE LEFT A BROOM ON
MY LEADS
OH WHAT A DISPLEASING HUNCHBACK'S FACE
OH WHAT AN ILL FAVORED SOUL
WHEW
THE MEN ON THE CONTRARY WERE DELIGHTED AND APPLAUDED
QUASIMODO THE
OBJECT OF THE TUMULT STILL STOOD ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE CHAPEL SOMBRE
AND GRAVE AND ALLOWED THEM TO ADMIRE HIM
ONE SCHOLAR ROBIN POUSSEPAIN I THINK CAME AND LAUGHED IN HIS FACE
AND TOO CLOSE
QUASIMODO CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH TAKING HIM BY THE
GIRDLE AND HURLING HIM TEN PACES OFF AMID THE CROWD ALL WITHOUT
UTTERING A WORD
MASTER COPPENOLE IN AMAZEMENT APPROACHED HIM
CROSS OF GOD HOLY FATHER YOU POSSESS THE HANDSOMEST UGLINESS THAT I
HAVE EVER BEHELD IN MY LIFE
YOU WOULD DESERVE TO BE POPE AT ROME AS
WELL AS AT PARIS
SO SAYING HE PLACED HIS HAND GAYLY ON HIS SHOULDER
QUASIMODO DID NOT
STIR
COPPENOLE WENT ON
YOU ARE A ROGUE WITH WHOM I HAVE A FANCY FOR CAROUSING WERE IT TO COST
ME A NEW DOZEN OF TWELVE LIVRES OF TOURS
HOW DOES IT STRIKE YOU
QUASIMODO MADE NO REPLY
CROSS OF GOD SAID THE HOSIER ARE YOU DEAF
HE WAS IN TRUTH DEAF
NEVERTHELESS HE BEGAN TO GROW IMPATIENT WITH COPPENOLE'S BEHAVIOR AND
SUDDENLY TURNED TOWARDS HIM WITH SO FORMIDABLE A GNASHING OF TEETH THAT
THE FLEMISH GIANT RECOILED LIKE A BULL DOG BEFORE A CAT
THEN THERE WAS CREATED AROUND THAT STRANGE PERSONAGE A CIRCLE OF TERROR
AND RESPECT WHOSE RADIUS WAS AT LEAST FIFTEEN GEOMETRICAL FEET
AN OLD
WOMAN EXPLAINED TO COPPENOLE THAT QUASIMODO WAS DEAF
DEAF SAID THE HOSIER WITH HIS GREAT FLEMISH LAUGH
CROSS OF GOD
HE'S A PERFECT POPE
HE I RECOGNIZE HIM EXCLAIMED JEHAN WHO HAD AT LAST DESCENDED FROM
HIS CAPITAL IN ORDER TO SEE QUASIMODO AT CLOSER QUARTERS HE'S THE
BELLRINGER OF MY BROTHER THE ARCHDEACON
GOOD DAY QUASIMODO
WHAT A DEVIL OF A MAN SAID ROBIN POUSSEPAIN STILL ALL BRUISED
WITH HIS FALL
HE SHOWS HIMSELF HE'S A HUNCHBACK
HE WALKS HE'S
BANDY LEGGED
HE LOOKS AT YOU HE'S ONE EYED
YOU SPEAK TO HIM HE'S
DEAF
AND WHAT DOES THIS POLYPHEMUS DO WITH HIS TONGUE
HE SPEAKS WHEN HE CHOOSES SAID THE OLD WOMAN HE BECAME DEAF THROUGH
RINGING THE BELLS
HE IS NOT DUMB
THAT HE LACKS REMARKS JEHAN
AND HE HAS ONE EYE TOO MANY ADDED ROBIN POUSSEPAIN
NOT AT ALL SAID JEHAN WISELY
A ONE EYED MAN IS FAR LESS COMPLETE
THAN A BLIND MAN
HE KNOWS WHAT HE LACKS
IN THE MEANTIME ALL THE BEGGARS ALL THE LACKEYS ALL THE CUTPURSES
JOINED WITH THE SCHOLARS HAD GONE IN PROCESSION TO SEEK IN THE
CUPBOARD OF THE LAW CLERKS' COMPANY THE CARDBOARD TIARA AND THE
DERISIVE ROBE OF THE POPE OF THE FOOLS
QUASIMODO ALLOWED THEM TO ARRAY
HIM IN THEM WITHOUT WINCING AND WITH A SORT OF PROUD DOCILITY
THEN
THEY MADE HIM SEAT HIMSELF ON A MOTLEY LITTER
TWELVE OFFICERS OF THE
FRATERNITY OF FOOLS RAISED HIM ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND A SORT OF BITTER
AND DISDAINFUL JOY LIGHTED UP THE MOROSE FACE OF THE CYCLOPS WHEN HE
BEHELD BENEATH HIS DEFORMED FEET ALL THOSE HEADS OF HANDSOME STRAIGHT
WELL MADE MEN
THEN THE RAGGED AND HOWLING PROCESSION SET OUT ON ITS
MARCH ACCORDING TO CUSTOM AROUND THE INNER GALLERIES OF THE COURTS
BEFORE MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THE STREETS AND SQUARES
CHAPTER VI
ESMERALDA
WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO INFORM THE READER THAT DURING THE WHOLE
OF THIS SCENE GRINGOIRE AND HIS PIECE HAD STOOD FIRM
HIS ACTORS
SPURRED ON BY HIM HAD NOT CEASED TO SPOUT HIS COMEDY AND HE HAD NOT
CEASED TO LISTEN TO IT
HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND ABOUT THE TUMULT AND
WAS DETERMINED TO PROCEED TO THE END NOT GIVING UP THE HOPE OF A RETURN
OF ATTENTION ON THE PART OF THE PUBLIC
THIS GLEAM OF HOPE ACQUIRED
FRESH LIFE WHEN HE SAW QUASIMODO COPPENOLE AND THE DEAFENING ESCORT
OF THE POPE OF THE PROCESSION OF FOOLS QUIT THE HALL AMID GREAT UPROAR
THE THRONG RUSHED EAGERLY AFTER THEM
GOOD HE SAID TO HIMSELF THERE
GO ALL THE MISCHIEF MAKERS UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE MISCHIEF MAKERS
CONSTITUTED THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE
IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE GRAND
HALL WAS EMPTY
TO TELL THE TRUTH A FEW SPECTATORS STILL REMAINED SOME SCATTERED
OTHERS IN GROUPS AROUND THE PILLARS WOMEN OLD MEN OR CHILDREN
WHO HAD HAD ENOUGH OF THE UPROAR AND TUMULT
SOME SCHOLARS WERE STILL
PERCHED ASTRIDE OF THE WINDOW SILLS ENGAGED IN GAZING INTO THE PLACE
WELL THOUGHT GRINGOIRE HERE ARE STILL AS MANY AS ARE REQUIRED TO
HEAR THE END OF MY MYSTERY
THEY ARE FEW IN NUMBER BUT IT IS A CHOICE
AUDIENCE A LETTERED AUDIENCE
AN INSTANT LATER A SYMPHONY WHICH HAD BEEN INTENDED TO PRODUCE THE
GREATEST EFFECT ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE VIRGIN WAS LACKING
GRINGOIRE
PERCEIVED THAT HIS MUSIC HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF BY THE PROCESSION OF THE
POPE OF THE FOOLS
SKIP IT SAID HE STOICALLY
HE APPROACHED A GROUP OF BOURGEOIS WHO SEEMED TO HIM TO BE DISCUSSING
HIS PIECE
THIS IS THE FRAGMENT OF CONVERSATION WHICH HE CAUGHT
YOU KNOW MASTER CHENETEAU THE HTEL DE NAVARRE WHICH BELONGED TO
MONSIEUR DE NEMOURS
YES OPPOSITE THE CHAPELLE DE BRAQUE
WELL THE TREASURY HAS JUST LET IT TO GUILLAUME ALIXANDRE HISTORIAN
FOR SIX HIVRES EIGHT SOLS PARISIAN A YEAR
HOW RENTS ARE GOING UP
COME SAID GRINGOIRE TO HIMSELF WITH A SIGH THE OTHERS ARE
LISTENING
COMRADES SUDDENLY SHOUTED ONE OF THE YOUNG SCAMPS FROM THE WINDOW
LA ESMERALDA LA ESMERALDA IN THE PLACE
THIS WORD PRODUCED A MAGICAL EFFECT
EVERY ONE WHO WAS LEFT IN THE HALL
FLEW TO THE WINDOWS CLIMBING THE WALLS IN ORDER TO SEE AND REPEATING
LA ESMERALDA LA ESMERALDA AT THE SAME TIME A GREAT SOUND OF
APPLAUSE WAS HEARD FROM WITHOUT
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS OF THE ESMERALDA SAID GRINGOIRE WRINGING
HIS HANDS IN DESPAIR
AH GOOD HEAVENS IT SEEMS TO BE THE TURN OF THE
WINDOWS NOW
HE RETURNED TOWARDS THE MARBLE TABLE AND SAW THAT THE REPRESENTATION
HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
IT WAS PRECISELY AT THE INSTANT WHEN JUPITER
SHOULD HAVE APPEARED WITH HIS THUNDER
BUT JUPITER WAS STANDING
MOTIONLESS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAGE
MICHEL GIBORNE CRIED THE IRRITATED POET WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE
IS THAT YOUR PART COME UP
ALAS SAID JUPITER A SCHOLAR HAS JUST SEIZED THE LADDER
GRINGOIRE LOOKED
IT WAS BUT TOO TRUE
ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN HIS
PLOT AND ITS SOLUTION WAS INTERCEPTED
THE RASCAL HE MURMURED
AND WHY DID HE TAKE THAT LADDER
IN ORDER TO GO AND SEE THE ESMERALDA REPLIED JUPITER PITEOUSLY
HE
SAID 'COME HERE'S A LADDER THAT'S OF NO USE AND HE TOOK IT
THIS WAS THE LAST BLOW
GRINGOIRE RECEIVED IT WITH RESIGNATION
MAY THE DEVIL FLY AWAY WITH YOU HE SAID TO THE COMEDIAN AND IF I
GET MY PAY YOU SHALL RECEIVE YOURS
THEN HE BEAT A RETREAT WITH DROOPING HEAD BUT THE LAST IN THE FIELD
LIKE A GENERAL WHO HAS FOUGHT WELL
AND AS HE DESCENDED THE WINDING STAIRS OF THE COURTS A FINE RABBLE OF
ASSES AND DOLTS THESE PARISIANS HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH THEY
COME TO HEAR A MYSTERY AND DON'T LISTEN TO IT AT ALL THEY ARE ENGROSSED
BY EVERY ONE BY CHOPIN TROUILLEFOU BY THE CARDINAL BY COPPENOLE BY
QUASIMODO BY THE DEVIL BUT BY MADAME THE VIRGIN MARY NOT AT ALL
IF
I HAD KNOWN I'D HAVE GIVEN YOU VIRGIN MARY YOU NINNIES AND I TO
COME TO SEE FACES AND BEHOLD ONLY BACKS TO BE A POET AND TO REAP THE
SUCCESS OF AN APOTHECARY IT IS TRUE THAT HOMERUS BEGGED THROUGH THE
GREEK TOWNS AND THAT NASO DIED IN EXILE AMONG THE MUSCOVITES
BUT MAY
THE DEVIL FLAY ME IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY MEAN WITH THEIR ESMERALDA
WHAT IS THAT WORD IN THE FIRST PLACE 'TIS EGYPTIAN
BOOK SECOND
CHAPTER I
FROM CHARYBDIS TO SCYLLA
NIGHT COMES ON EARLY IN JANUARY
THE STREETS WERE ALREADY DARK WHEN
GRINGOIRE ISSUED FORTH FROM THE COURTS
THIS GLOOM PLEASED HIM HE WAS
IN HASTE TO REACH SOME OBSCURE AND DESERTED ALLEY IN ORDER THERE TO
MEDITATE AT HIS EASE AND IN ORDER THAT THE PHILOSOPHER MIGHT PLACE THE
FIRST DRESSING UPON THE WOUND OF THE POET
PHILOSOPHY MOREOVER WAS HIS
SOLE REFUGE FOR HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS TO LODGE FOR THE NIGHT
AFTER THE BRILLIANT FAILURE OF HIS FIRST THEATRICAL VENTURE HE
DARED NOT RETURN TO THE LODGING WHICH HE OCCUPIED IN THE RUE
GRENIER SUR L'EAU OPPOSITE TO THE PORT AU FOIN HAVING DEPENDED
UPON RECEIVING FROM MONSIEUR THE PROVOST FOR HIS EPITHALAMIUM THE
WHEREWITHAL TO PAY MASTER GUILLAUME DOULX SIRE FARMER OF THE TAXES ON
CLOVEN FOOTED ANIMALS IN PARIS THE RENT WHICH HE OWED HIM THAT IS
TO SAY TWELVE SOLS PARISIAN TWELVE TIMES THE VALUE OF ALL THAT HE
POSSESSED IN THE WORLD INCLUDING HIS TRUNK HOSE HIS SHIRT AND HIS
CAP
AFTER REFLECTING A MOMENT TEMPORARILY SHELTERED BENEATH THE LITTLE
WICKET OF THE PRISON OF THE TREASURER OF THE SAINTE CHAPPELLE AS TO THE
SHELTER WHICH HE WOULD SELECT FOR THE NIGHT HAVING ALL THE PAVEMENTS OF
PARIS TO CHOOSE FROM HE REMEMBERED TO HAVE NOTICED THE WEEK PREVIOUSLY
IN THE RUE DE LA SAVATERIE AT THE DOOR OF A COUNCILLOR OF THE
PARLIAMENT A STEPPING STONE FOR MOUNTING A MULE AND TO HAVE SAID TO
HIMSELF THAT THAT STONE WOULD FURNISH ON OCCASION A VERY EXCELLENT
PILLOW FOR A MENDICANT OR A POET
HE THANKED PROVIDENCE FOR HAVING SENT
THIS HAPPY IDEA TO HIM BUT AS HE WAS PREPARING TO CROSS THE PLACE
IN ORDER TO REACH THE TORTUOUS LABYRINTH OF THE CITY WHERE MEANDER
ALL THOSE OLD SISTER STREETS THE RUES DE LA BARILLERIE DE LA
VIELLE DRAPERIE DE LA SAVATERIE DE LA JUIVERIE ETC STILL EXTANT
TO DAY WITH THEIR NINE STORY HOUSES HE SAW THE PROCESSION OF THE POPE
OF THE FOOLS WHICH WAS ALSO EMERGING FROM THE COURT HOUSE AND RUSHING
ACROSS THE COURTYARD WITH GREAT CRIES A GREAT FLASHING OF TORCHES AND
THE MUSIC WHICH BELONGED TO HIM GRINGOIRE
THIS SIGHT REVIVED THE
PAIN OF HIS SELF LOVE HE FLED
IN THE BITTERNESS OF HIS DRAMATIC
MISADVENTURE EVERYTHING WHICH REMINDED HIM OF THE FESTIVAL OF THAT DAY
IRRITATED HIS WOUND AND MADE IT BLEED
58
HE WAS ON THE POINT OF TURNING TO THE PONT SAINT MICHEL CHILDREN WERE
RUNNING ABOUT HERE AND THERE WITH FIRE LANCES AND ROCKETS
PEST ON FIREWORK CANDLES SAID GRINGOIRE AND HE FELL BACK ON THE PONT
AU CHANGE
TO THE HOUSE AT THE HEAD OF THE BRIDGE THERE HAD BEEN AFFIXED
THREE SMALL BANNERS REPRESENTING THE KING THE DAUPHIN AND MARGUERITE
OF FLANDERS AND SIX LITTLE PENNONS ON WHICH WERE PORTRAYED THE DUKE OF
AUSTRIA THE CARDINAL DE BOURBON M
DE BEAUJEU AND MADAME JEANNE DE
FRANCE AND MONSIEUR THE BASTARD OF BOURBON AND I KNOW NOT WHOM ELSE
ALL BEING ILLUMINATED WITH TORCHES
THE RABBLE WERE ADMIRING
HAPPY PAINTER JEHAN FOURBAULT SAID GRINGOIRE WITH A DEEP SIGH
AND HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE BANNERETS AND PENNONS
A STREET OPENED
BEFORE HIM HE THOUGHT IT SO DARK AND DESERTED THAT HE HOPED TO THERE
ESCAPE FROM ALL THE RUMORS AS WELL AS FROM ALL THE GLEAMS OF THE
FESTIVAL
AT THE END OF A FEW MOMENTS HIS FOOT CAME IN CONTACT WITH AN
OBSTACLE HE STUMBLED AND FELL
IT WAS THE MAY TRUSS WHICH THE CLERKS
OF THE CLERKS' LAW COURT HAD DEPOSITED THAT MORNING AT THE DOOR OF
A PRESIDENT OF THE PARLIAMENT IN HONOR OF THE SOLEMNITY OF THE DAY
GRINGOIRE BORE THIS NEW DISASTER HEROICALLY HE PICKED HIMSELF UP AND
REACHED THE WATER'S EDGE
AFTER LEAVING BEHIND HIM THE CIVIC TOURNELLE
AND THE CRIMINAL TOWER AND SKIRTED THE GREAT WALLS OF THE KING'S
GARDEN ON THAT UNPAVED STRAND WHERE THE MUD REACHED TO HIS ANKLES HE
REACHED THE WESTERN POINT OF THE CITY AND CONSIDERED FOR SOME TIME
THE ISLET OF THE PASSEUR AUX VACHES WHICH HAS DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE
BRONZE HORSE OF THE PONT NEUF
THE ISLET APPEARED TO HIM IN THE SHADOW
LIKE A BLACK MASS BEYOND THE NARROW STRIP OF WHITISH WATER WHICH
SEPARATED HIM FROM IT
ONE COULD DIVINE BY THE RAY OF A TINY LIGHT THE
SORT OF HUT IN THE FORM OF A BEEHIVE WHERE THE FERRYMAN OF COWS TOOK
REFUGE AT NIGHT
A CHAMBER OF THE ANCIENT PARLIAMENT OF PARIS
HAPPY FERRYMAN THOUGHT GRINGOIRE YOU DO NOT DREAM OF GLORY AND
YOU DO NOT MAKE MARRIAGE SONGS WHAT MATTERS IT TO YOU IF KINGS AND
DUCHESSES OF BURGUNDY MARRY YOU KNOW NO OTHER DAISIES MARGUERITES
THAN THOSE WHICH YOUR APRIL GREENSWARD GIVES YOUR COWS TO BROWSE UPON
WHILE I A POET AM HOOTED AND SHIVER AND OWE TWELVE SOUS AND THE
SOLES OF MY SHOES ARE SO TRANSPARENT THAT THEY MIGHT SERVE AS GLASSES
FOR YOUR LANTERN THANKS FERRYMAN YOUR CABIN RESTS MY EYES AND MAKES
ME FORGET PARIS
HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS ALMOST LYRIC ECSTACY BY A BIG DOUBLE SAINT JEAN
CRACKER WHICH SUDDENLY WENT OFF FROM THE HAPPY CABIN
IT WAS THE COW
FERRYMAN WHO WAS TAKING HIS PART IN THE REJOICINGS OF THE DAY AND
LETTING OFF FIREWORKS
THIS CRACKER MADE GRINGOIRE'S SKIN BRISTLE UP ALL OVER
ACCURSED FESTIVAL HE EXCLAIMED WILT THOU PURSUE ME EVERYWHERE OH
GOOD GOD EVEN TO THE FERRYMAN'S
THEN HE LOOKED AT THE SEINE AT HIS FEET AND A HORRIBLE TEMPTATION TOOK
POSSESSION OF HIM
OH SAID HE I WOULD GLADLY DROWN MYSELF WERE THE WATER NOT SO
COLD
THEN A DESPERATE RESOLUTION OCCURRED TO HIM
IT WAS SINCE HE COULD NOT
ESCAPE FROM THE POPE OF THE FOOLS FROM JEHAN FOURBAULT'S BANNERETS
FROM MAY TRUSSES FROM SQUIBS AND CRACKERS TO GO TO THE PLACE DE GRVE
AT LEAST HE SAID TO HIMSELF I SHALL THERE HAVE A FIREBRAND OF JOY
WHEREWITH TO WARM MYSELF AND I CAN SUP ON SOME CRUMBS OF THE THREE
GREAT ARMORIAL BEARINGS OF ROYAL SUGAR WHICH HAVE BEEN ERECTED ON THE
PUBLIC REFRESHMENT STALL OF THE CITY
CHAPTER II
THE PLACE DE GREVE
THERE REMAINS TO DAY BUT A VERY IMPERCEPTIBLE VESTIGE OF THE PLACE
DE GRVE SUCH AS IT EXISTED THEN IT CONSISTS IN THE CHARMING LITTLE
TURRET WHICH OCCUPIES THE ANGLE NORTH OF THE PLACE AND WHICH ALREADY
ENSHROUDED IN THE IGNOBLE PLASTER WHICH FILLS WITH PASTE THE DELICATE
LINES OF ITS SCULPTURE WOULD SOON HAVE DISAPPEARED PERHAPS SUBMERGED
BY THAT FLOOD OF NEW HOUSES WHICH SO RAPIDLY DEVOURS ALL THE ANCIENT
FAADES OF PARIS
THE PERSONS WHO LIKE OURSELVES NEVER CROSS THE PLACE DE GRVE WITHOUT
CASTING A GLANCE OF PITY AND SYMPATHY ON THAT POOR TURRET STRANGLED
BETWEEN TWO HOVELS OF THE TIME OF LOUIS XV CAN EASILY RECONSTRUCT IN
THEIR MINDS THE AGGREGATE OF EDIFICES TO WHICH IT BELONGED AND FIND
AGAIN ENTIRE IN IT THE ANCIENT GOTHIC PLACE OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
IT WAS THEN AS IT IS TO DAY AN IRREGULAR TRAPEZOID BORDERED ON ONE
SIDE BY THE QUAY AND ON THE OTHER THREE BY A SERIES OF LOFTY NARROW
AND GLOOMY HOUSES
BY DAY ONE COULD ADMIRE THE VARIETY OF ITS EDIFICES
ALL SCULPTURED IN STONE OR WOOD AND ALREADY PRESENTING COMPLETE
SPECIMENS OF THE DIFFERENT DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURES OF THE MIDDLE AGES
RUNNING BACK FROM THE FIFTEENTH TO THE ELEVENTH CENTURY FROM THE
CASEMENT WHICH HAD BEGUN TO DETHRONE THE ARCH TO THE ROMAN SEMICIRCLE
WHICH HAD BEEN SUPPLANTED BY THE OGIVE AND WHICH STILL OCCUPIES BELOW
IT THE FIRST STORY OF THAT ANCIENT HOUSE DE LA TOUR ROLAND AT THE
CORNER OF THE PLACE UPON THE SEINE ON THE SIDE OF THE STREET WITH THE
TANNERIE
AT NIGHT ONE COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING OF ALL THAT MASS OF
BUILDINGS EXCEPT THE BLACK INDENTATION OF THE ROOFS UNROLLING
THEIR CHAIN OF ACUTE ANGLES ROUND THE PLACE FOR ONE OF THE RADICAL
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CITIES OF THAT TIME AND THE CITIES OF THE
PRESENT DAY LAY IN THE FAADES WHICH LOOKED UPON THE PLACES AND
STREETS AND WHICH WERE THEN GABLES
FOR THE LAST TWO CENTURIES THE
HOUSES HAVE BEEN TURNED ROUND
IN THE CENTRE OF THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PLACE ROSE A HEAVY AND HYBRID
CONSTRUCTION FORMED OF THREE BUILDINGS PLACED IN JUXTAPOSITION
IT WAS
CALLED BY THREE NAMES WHICH EXPLAIN ITS HISTORY ITS DESTINATION AND
ITS ARCHITECTURE THE HOUSE OF THE DAUPHIN BECAUSE CHARLES V WHEN
DAUPHIN HAD INHABITED IT THE MARCHANDISE BECAUSE IT HAD SERVED AS
TOWN HALL AND THE PILLARED HOUSE DOMUS AD PILORIA BECAUSE OF
A SERIES OF LARGE PILLARS WHICH SUSTAINED THE THREE STORIES
THE CITY
FOUND THERE ALL THAT IS REQUIRED FOR A CITY LIKE PARIS A CHAPEL IN
WHICH TO PRAY TO GOD A PLAIDOYER OR PLEADING ROOM IN WHICH TO HOLD
HEARINGS AND TO REPEL AT NEED THE KING'S PEOPLE AND UNDER THE ROOF
AN ARSENAC FULL OF ARTILLERY
FOR THE BOURGEOIS OF PARIS WERE AWARE
THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PRAY IN EVERY CONJUNCTURE AND TO PLEAD
FOR THE FRANCHISES OF THE CITY AND THEY HAD ALWAYS IN RESERVE IN THE
GARRET OF THE TOWN HALL A FEW GOOD RUSTY ARQUEBUSES
THE GRVE HAD THEN
THAT SINISTER ASPECT WHICH IT PRESERVES TO DAY FROM THE EXECRABLE IDEAS
WHICH IT AWAKENS AND FROM THE SOMBRE TOWN HALL OF DOMINIQUE BOCADOR
WHICH HAS REPLACED THE PILLARED HOUSE
IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT A
PERMANENT GIBBET AND A PILLORY A JUSTICE AND A LADDER AS THEY WERE
CALLED IN THAT DAY ERECTED SIDE BY SIDE IN THE CENTRE OF THE PAVEMENT
CONTRIBUTED NOT A LITTLE TO CAUSE EYES TO BE TURNED AWAY FROM THAT
FATAL PLACE WHERE SO MANY BEINGS FULL OF LIFE AND HEALTH HAVE AGONIZED
WHERE FIFTY YEARS LATER THAT FEVER OF SAINT VALLIER WAS DESTINED TO
HAVE ITS BIRTH THAT TERROR OF THE SCAFFOLD THE MOST MONSTROUS OF ALL
MALADIES BECAUSE IT COMES NOT FROM GOD BUT FROM MAN
IT IS A CONSOLING IDEA LET US REMARK IN PASSING TO THINK THAT THE
DEATH PENALTY WHICH THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO STILL ENCUMBERED WITH ITS
IRON WHEELS ITS STONE GIBBETS AND ALL ITS PARAPHERNALIA OF TORTURE
PERMANENT AND RIVETED TO THE PAVEMENT THE GRVE THE HALLES THE PLACE
DAUPHINE THE CROSS DU TRAHOIR THE MARCH AUX POURCEAUX THAT HIDEOUS
MONTFAUON THE BARRIER DES SERGENTS THE PLACE AUX CHATS THE PORTE
SAINT DENIS CHAMPEAUX THE PORTE BAUDETS THE PORTE SAINT JACQUES
WITHOUT RECKONING THE INNUMERABLE LADDERS OF THE PROVOSTS THE BISHOP OF
THE CHAPTERS OF THE ABBOTS OF THE PRIORS WHO HAD THE DECREE OF LIFE
AND DEATH WITHOUT RECKONING THE JUDICIAL DROWNINGS IN THE RIVER SEINE
IT IS CONSOLING TO DAY AFTER HAVING LOST SUCCESSIVELY ALL THE PIECES OF
ITS ARMOR ITS LUXURY OF TORMENT ITS PENALTY OF IMAGINATION AND FANCY
ITS TORTURE FOR WHICH IT RECONSTRUCTED EVERY FIVE YEARS A LEATHER BED
AT THE GRAND CHTELET THAT ANCIENT SUZERAIN OF FEUDAL SOCIETY ALMOST
EXPUNGED FROM OUR LAWS AND OUR CITIES HUNTED FROM CODE TO CODE CHASED
FROM PLACE TO PLACE HAS NO LONGER IN OUR IMMENSE PARIS ANY MORE THAN
A DISHONORED CORNER OF THE GRVE THAN A MISERABLE GUILLOTINE FURTIVE
UNEASY SHAMEFUL WHICH SEEMS ALWAYS AFRAID OF BEING CAUGHT IN THE ACT
SO QUICKLY DOES IT DISAPPEAR AFTER HAVING DEALT ITS BLOW
CHAPTER III
KISSES FOR BLOWS
WHEN PIERRE GRINGOIRE ARRIVED ON THE PLACE DE GRVE HE WAS PARALYZED
HE HAD DIRECTED HIS COURSE ACROSS THE PONT AUX MEUNIERS IN ORDER
TO AVOID THE RABBLE ON THE PONT AU CHANGE AND THE PENNONS OF JEHAN
FOURBAULT BUT THE WHEELS OF ALL THE BISHOP'S MILLS HAD SPLASHED HIM AS
HE PASSED AND HIS DOUBLET WAS DRENCHED IT SEEMED TO HIM BESIDES THAT
THE FAILURE OF HIS PIECE HAD RENDERED HIM STILL MORE SENSIBLE TO COLD
THAN USUAL
HENCE HE MADE HASTE TO DRAW NEAR THE BONFIRE WHICH WAS
BURNING MAGNIFICENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLACE
BUT A CONSIDERABLE
CROWD FORMED A CIRCLE AROUND IT
ACCURSED PARISIANS HE SAID TO HIMSELF FOR GRINGOIRE LIKE A TRUE
DRAMATIC POET WAS SUBJECT TO MONOLOGUES THERE THEY ARE OBSTRUCTING MY
FIRE NEVERTHELESS I AM GREATLY IN NEED OF A CHIMNEY CORNER MY SHOES
DRINK IN THE WATER AND ALL THOSE CURSED MILLS WEPT UPON ME THAT DEVIL
OF A BISHOP OF PARIS WITH HIS MILLS I'D JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHAT USE A
BISHOP CAN MAKE OF A MILL DOES HE EXPECT TO BECOME A MILLER INSTEAD OF
A BISHOP IF ONLY MY MALEDICTION IS NEEDED FOR THAT I BESTOW IT UPON
HIM AND HIS CATHEDRAL AND HIS MILLS JUST SEE IF THOSE BOOBIES WILL
PUT THEMSELVES OUT MOVE ASIDE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING
THERE THEY ARE WARMING THEMSELVES MUCH PLEASURE MAY IT GIVE THEM THEY
ARE WATCHING A HUNDRED FAGOTS BURN A FINE SPECTACLE
ON LOOKING MORE CLOSELY HE PERCEIVED THAT THE CIRCLE WAS MUCH LARGER
THAN WAS REQUIRED SIMPLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING WARM AT THE KING'S
FIRE AND THAT THIS CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE HAD NOT BEEN ATTRACTED SOLELY BY
THE BEAUTY OF THE HUNDRED FAGOTS WHICH WERE BURNING
IN A VAST SPACE LEFT FREE BETWEEN THE CROWD AND THE FIRE A YOUNG GIRL
WAS DANCING
WHETHER THIS YOUNG GIRL WAS A HUMAN BEING A FAIRY OR AN ANGEL IS WHAT
GRINGOIRE SCEPTICAL PHILOSOPHER AND IRONICAL POET THAT HE WAS COULD
NOT DECIDE AT THE FIRST MOMENT SO FASCINATED WAS HE BY THIS DAZZLING
VISION
SHE WAS NOT TALL THOUGH SHE SEEMED SO SO BOLDLY DID HER SLENDER FORM
DART ABOUT
SHE WAS SWARTHY OF COMPLEXION BUT ONE DIVINED THAT BY DAY
HER SKIN MUST POSSESS THAT BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN TONE OF THE ANDALUSIANS AND
THE ROMAN WOMEN
HER LITTLE FOOT TOO WAS ANDALUSIAN FOR IT WAS BOTH
PINCHED AND AT EASE IN ITS GRACEFUL SHOE
SHE DANCED SHE TURNED SHE
WHIRLED RAPIDLY ABOUT ON AN OLD PERSIAN RUG SPREAD NEGLIGENTLY UNDER
HER FEET AND EACH TIME THAT HER RADIANT FACE PASSED BEFORE YOU AS SHE
WHIRLED HER GREAT BLACK EYES DARTED A FLASH OF LIGHTNING AT YOU
ALL AROUND HER ALL GLANCES WERE RIVETED ALL MOUTHS OPEN AND IN FACT
WHEN SHE DANCED THUS TO THE HUMMING OF THE BASQUE TAMBOURINE WHICH
HER TWO PURE ROUNDED ARMS RAISED ABOVE HER HEAD SLENDER FRAIL AND
VIVACIOUS AS A WASP WITH HER CORSAGE OF GOLD WITHOUT A FOLD HER
VARIEGATED GOWN PUFFING OUT HER BARE SHOULDERS HER DELICATE LIMBS
WHICH HER PETTICOAT REVEALED AT TIMES HER BLACK HAIR HER EYES OF
FLAME SHE WAS A SUPERNATURAL CREATURE
IN TRUTH SAID GRINGOIRE TO HIMSELF SHE IS A SALAMANDER SHE IS A
NYMPH SHE IS A GODDESS SHE IS A BACCHANTE OF THE MENELEAN MOUNT
AT THAT MOMENT ONE OF THE SALAMANDER'S BRAIDS OF HAIR BECAME
UNFASTENED AND A PIECE OF YELLOW COPPER WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO IT
ROLLED TO THE GROUND
H NO SAID HE SHE IS A GYPSY
ALL ILLUSIONS HAD DISAPPEARED
SHE BEGAN HER DANCE ONCE MORE SHE TOOK FROM THE GROUND TWO SWORDS
WHOSE POINTS SHE RESTED AGAINST HER BROW AND WHICH SHE MADE TO TURN
IN ONE DIRECTION WHILE SHE TURNED IN THE OTHER IT WAS A PURELY GYPSY
EFFECT
BUT DISENCHANTED THOUGH GRINGOIRE WAS THE WHOLE EFFECT OF
THIS PICTURE WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS CHARM AND ITS MAGIC THE BONFIRE
ILLUMINATED WITH A RED FLARING LIGHT WHICH TREMBLED ALL ALIVE OVER
THE CIRCLE OF FACES IN THE CROWD ON THE BROW OF THE YOUNG GIRL AND AT
THE BACKGROUND OF THE PLACE CAST A PALLID REFLECTION ON ONE SIDE UPON
THE ANCIENT BLACK AND WRINKLED FAADE OF THE HOUSE OF PILLARS ON THE
OTHER UPON THE OLD STONE GIBBET
AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF VISAGES WHICH THAT LIGHT TINGED WITH SCARLET
THERE WAS ONE WHICH SEEMED EVEN MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS ABSORBED IN
CONTEMPLATION OF THE DANCER
IT WAS THE FACE OF A MAN AUSTERE CALM
AND SOMBRE
THIS MAN WHOSE COSTUME WAS CONCEALED BY THE CROWD WHICH
SURROUNDED HIM DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MORE THAN FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS OF
AGE NEVERTHELESS HE WAS BALD HE HAD MERELY A FEW TUFTS OF THIN GRAY
HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES HIS BROAD HIGH FOREHEAD HAD BEGUN TO BE FURROWED
WITH WRINKLES BUT HIS DEEP SET EYES SPARKLED WITH EXTRAORDINARY
YOUTHFULNESS AN ARDENT LIFE A PROFOUND PASSION
HE KEPT THEM FIXED
INCESSANTLY ON THE GYPSY AND WHILE THE GIDDY YOUNG GIRL OF SIXTEEN
DANCED AND WHIRLED FOR THE PLEASURE OF ALL HIS REVERY SEEMED TO BECOME
MORE AND MORE SOMBRE
FROM TIME TO TIME A SMILE AND A SIGH MET UPON HIS
LIPS BUT THE SMILE WAS MORE MELANCHOLY THAN THE SIGH
THE YOUNG GIRL STOPPED AT LENGTH BREATHLESS AND THE PEOPLE APPLAUDED
HER LOVINGLY
DJALI SAID THE GYPSY
THEN GRINGOIRE SAW COME UP TO HER A PRETTY LITTLE WHITE GOAT ALERT
WIDE AWAKE GLOSSY WITH GILDED HORNS GILDED HOOFS AND GILDED COLLAR
WHICH HE HAD NOT HITHERTO PERCEIVED AND WHICH HAD REMAINED LYING CURLED
UP ON ONE CORNER OF THE CARPET WATCHING HIS MISTRESS DANCE
DJALI SAID THE DANCER IT IS YOUR TURN
AND SEATING HERSELF SHE GRACEFULLY PRESENTED HER TAMBOURINE TO THE
GOAT
DJALI SHE CONTINUED WHAT MONTH IS THIS
THE GOAT LIFTED ITS FORE FOOT AND STRUCK ONE BLOW UPON THE TAMBOURINE
IT WAS THE FIRST MONTH IN THE YEAR IN FACT
DJALI PURSUED THE YOUNG GIRL TURNING HER TAMBOURINE ROUND WHAT DAY
OF THE MONTH IS THIS
DJALI RAISED HIS LITTLE GILT HOOF AND STRUCK SIX BLOWS ON THE
TAMBOURINE
DJALI PURSUED THE EGYPTIAN WITH STILL ANOTHER MOVEMENT OF THE
TAMBOURINE WHAT HOUR OF THE DAY IS IT
DJALI STRUCK SEVEN BLOWS
AT THAT MOMENT THE CLOCK OF THE PILLAR HOUSE
RANG OUT SEVEN
THE PEOPLE WERE AMAZED
THERE'S SORCERY AT THE BOTTOM OF IT SAID A SINISTER VOICE IN THE
CROWD
IT WAS THAT OF THE BALD MAN WHO NEVER REMOVED HIS EYES FROM THE
GYPSY
SHE SHUDDERED AND TURNED ROUND BUT APPLAUSE BROKE FORTH AND DROWNED THE
MOROSE EXCLAMATION
IT EVEN EFFACED IT SO COMPLETELY FROM HER MIND THAT SHE CONTINUED TO
QUESTION HER GOAT
DJALI WHAT DOES MASTER GUICHARD GRAND REMY CAPTAIN OF THE PISTOLIERS
OF THE TOWN DO AT THE PROCESSION OF CANDLEMAS
DJALI REARED HIMSELF ON HIS HIND LEGS AND BEGAN TO BLEAT MARCHING
ALONG WITH SO MUCH DAINTY GRAVITY THAT THE ENTIRE CIRCLE OF SPECTATORS
BURST INTO A LAUGH AT THIS PARODY OF THE INTERESTED DEVOUTNESS OF THE
CAPTAIN OF PISTOLIERS
DJALI RESUMED THE YOUNG GIRL EMBOLDENED BY HER GROWING SUCCESS
HOW PREACHES MASTER JACQUES CHARMOLUE PROCURATOR TO THE KING IN THE
ECCLESIASTICAL COURT
THE GOAT SEATED HIMSELF ON HIS HIND QUARTERS AND BEGAN TO BLEAT WAVING
HIS FORE FEET IN SO STRANGE A MANNER THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
THE BAD FRENCH AND WORSE LATIN JACQUES CHARMOLUE WAS THERE
COMPLETE GESTURE ACCENT AND ATTITUDE
AND THE CROWD APPLAUDED LOUDER THAN EVER
SACRILEGE PROFANATION RESUMED THE VOICE OF THE BALD MAN
THE GYPSY TURNED ROUND ONCE MORE
AH SAID SHE 'TIS THAT VILLANOUS MAN THEN THRUSTING HER UNDER
LIP OUT BEYOND THE UPPER SHE MADE A LITTLE POUT WHICH APPEARED TO
BE FAMILIAR TO HER EXECUTED A PIROUETTE ON HER HEEL AND SET ABOUT
COLLECTING IN HER TAMBOURINE THE GIFTS OF THE MULTITUDE
BIG BLANKS LITTLE BLANKS TARGES AND EAGLE LIARDS SHOWERED INTO IT
A BLANK AN OLD FRENCH COIN SIX BLANKS WERE WORTH TWO SOUS
AND A HALF TARGE AN ANCIENT COIN OF BURGUNDY A FARTHING
ALL AT ONCE SHE PASSED IN FRONT OF GRINGOIRE
GRINGOIRE PUT HIS HAND SO
RECKLESSLY INTO HIS POCKET THAT SHE HALTED
THE DEVIL SAID THE POET
FINDING AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS POCKET THE REALITY THAT IS TO SAY A
VOID
IN THE MEANTIME THE PRETTY GIRL STOOD THERE GAZING AT HIM
WITH HER BIG EYES AND HOLDING OUT HER TAMBOURINE TO HIM AND WAITING
GRINGOIRE BROKE INTO A VIOLENT PERSPIRATION
IF HE HAD ALL PERU IN HIS POCKET HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE GIVEN IT TO
THE DANCER BUT GRINGOIRE HAD NOT PERU AND MOREOVER AMERICA HAD NOT
YET BEEN DISCOVERED
HAPPILY AN UNEXPECTED INCIDENT CAME TO HIS RESCUE
WILL YOU TAKE YOURSELF OFF YOU EGYPTIAN GRASSHOPPER CRIED A SHARP
VOICE WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THE DARKEST CORNER OF THE PLACE
THE YOUNG GIRL TURNED ROUND IN AFFRIGHT
IT WAS NO LONGER THE VOICE OF
THE BALD MAN IT WAS THE VOICE OF A WOMAN BIGOTED AND MALICIOUS
HOWEVER THIS CRY WHICH ALARMED THE GYPSY DELIGHTED A TROOP OF
CHILDREN WHO WERE PROWLING ABOUT THERE
IT IS THE RECLUSE OF THE TOUR ROLAND THEY EXCLAIMED WITH WILD
LAUGHTER IT IS THE SACKED NUN WHO IS SCOLDING HASN'T SHE SUPPED
LET'S CARRY HER THE REMAINS OF THE CITY REFRESHMENTS
ALL RUSHED TOWARDS THE PILLAR HOUSE
IN THE MEANWHILE GRINGOIRE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DANCER'S
EMBARRASSMENT TO DISAPPEAR
THE CHILDREN'S SHOUTS HAD REMINDED HIM THAT
HE ALSO HAD NOT SUPPED SO HE RAN TO THE PUBLIC BUFFET
BUT THE LITTLE
RASCALS HAD BETTER LEGS THAN HE WHEN HE ARRIVED THEY HAD STRIPPED THE
TABLE
THERE REMAINED NOT SO MUCH AS A MISERABLE CAMICHON AT FIVE SOUS
THE POUND
NOTHING REMAINED UPON THE WALL BUT SLENDER FLEURS DE LIS
MINGLED WITH ROSE BUSHES PAINTED IN 1434 BY MATHIEU BITERNE
IT WAS A
MEAGRE SUPPER
IT IS AN UNPLEASANT THING TO GO TO BED WITHOUT SUPPER IT IS A STILL
LESS PLEASANT THING NOT TO SUP AND NOT TO KNOW WHERE ONE IS TO SLEEP
THAT WAS GRINGOIRE'S CONDITION
NO SUPPER NO SHELTER HE SAW HIMSELF
PRESSED ON ALL SIDES BY NECESSITY AND HE FOUND NECESSITY VERY CRABBED
HE HAD LONG AGO DISCOVERED THE TRUTH THAT JUPITER CREATED MEN DURING A
FIT OF MISANTHROPY AND THAT DURING A WISE MAN'S WHOLE LIFE HIS DESTINY
HOLDS HIS PHILOSOPHY IN A STATE OF SIEGE
AS FOR HIMSELF HE HAD NEVER
SEEN THE BLOCKADE SO COMPLETE HE HEARD HIS STOMACH SOUNDING A PARLEY
AND HE CONSIDERED IT VERY MUCH OUT OF PLACE THAT EVIL DESTINY SHOULD
CAPTURE HIS PHILOSOPHY BY FAMINE
THIS MELANCHOLY REVERY WAS ABSORBING HIM MORE AND MORE WHEN A SONG
QUAINT BUT FULL OF SWEETNESS SUDDENLY TORE HIM FROM IT
IT WAS THE
YOUNG GYPSY WHO WAS SINGING
HER VOICE WAS LIKE HER DANCING LIKE HER BEAUTY
IT WAS INDEFINABLE
AND CHARMING SOMETHING PURE AND SONOROUS AERIAL WINGED SO TO SPEAK
THERE WERE CONTINUAL OUTBURSTS MELODIES UNEXPECTED CADENCES THEN
SIMPLE PHRASES STREWN WITH AERIAL AND HISSING NOTES THEN FLOODS OF
SCALES WHICH WOULD HAVE PUT A NIGHTINGALE TO ROUT BUT IN WHICH HARMONY
WAS ALWAYS PRESENT THEN SOFT MODULATIONS OF OCTAVES WHICH ROSE AND
FELL LIKE THE BOSOM OF THE YOUNG SINGER
HER BEAUTIFUL FACE FOLLOWED
WITH SINGULAR MOBILITY ALL THE CAPRICES OF HER SONG FROM THE WILDEST
INSPIRATION TO THE CHASTEST DIGNITY
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HER NOW A
MAD CREATURE NOW A QUEEN
THE WORDS WHICH SHE SANG WERE IN A TONGUE UNKNOWN TO GRINGOIRE AND
WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TO BE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF SO LITTLE RELATION DID
THE EXPRESSION WHICH SHE IMPARTED TO HER SONG BEAR TO THE SENSE OF THE
WORDS
THUS THESE FOUR LINES IN HER MOUTH WERE MADLY GAY
UN COFRE DE GRAN RIQUEZA
HALLARON DENTRO UN PILAR
DENTRO DEL NUEVAS BANDERAS
CON FIGURAS DE ESPANTAR
A COFFER OF GREAT RICHNESS
IN A PILLAR'S HEART THEY FOUND
WITHIN IT LAY NEW BANNERS
WITH FIGURES TO ASTOUND
AND AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS AT THE ACCENTS WHICH SHE IMPARTED TO THIS
STANZA
ALARABES DE CAVALLO
SIN PODERSE MENEAR
CON ESPADAS Y LOS CUELLOS
BALLESTAS DE BUEN ECHAR
GRINGOIRE FELT THE TEARS START TO HIS EYES
NEVERTHELESS HER SONG
BREATHED JOY MOST OF ALL AND SHE SEEMED TO SING LIKE A BIRD FROM
SERENITY AND HEEDLESSNESS
THE GYPSY'S SONG HAD DISTURBED GRINGOIRE'S REVERY AS THE SWAN DISTURBS
THE WATER
HE LISTENED IN A SORT OF RAPTURE AND FORGETFULNESS OF
EVERYTHING
IT WAS THE FIRST MOMENT IN THE COURSE OF MANY HOURS WHEN HE
DID NOT FEEL THAT HE SUFFERED
THE MOMENT WAS BRIEF
THE SAME WOMAN'S VOICE WHICH HAD INTERRUPTED THE GYPSY'S DANCE
INTERRUPTED HER SONG
WILL YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU CRICKET OF HELL IT CRIED STILL FROM
THE SAME OBSCURE CORNER OF THE PLACE
THE POOR CRICKET STOPPED SHORT
GRINGOIRE COVERED UP HIS EARS
OH HE EXCLAIMED ACCURSED SAW WITH MISSING TEETH WHICH COMES TO
BREAK THE LYRE
MEANWHILE THE OTHER SPECTATORS MURMURED LIKE HIMSELF TO THE DEVIL
WITH THE SACKED NUN SAID SOME OF THEM
AND THE OLD INVISIBLE KILL JOY
MIGHT HAVE HAD OCCASION TO REPENT OF HER AGGRESSIONS AGAINST THE GYPSY
HAD THEIR ATTENTION NOT BEEN DIVERTED AT THIS MOMENT BY THE PROCESSION
OF THE POPE OF THE FOOLS WHICH AFTER HAVING TRAVERSED MANY STREETS AND
SQUARES DEBOUCHED ON THE PLACE DE GRVE WITH ALL ITS TORCHES AND ALL
ITS UPROAR
THIS PROCESSION WHICH OUR READERS HAVE SEEN SET OUT FROM THE PALAIS
DE JUSTICE HAD ORGANIZED ON THE WAY AND HAD BEEN RECRUITED BY ALL
THE KNAVES IDLE THIEVES AND UNEMPLOYED VAGABONDS IN PARIS SO THAT IT
PRESENTED A VERY RESPECTABLE ASPECT WHEN IT ARRIVED AT THE GRVE
FIRST CAME EGYPT
THE DUKE OF EGYPT HEADED IT ON HORSEBACK WITH HIS
COUNTS ON FOOT HOLDING HIS BRIDLE AND STIRRUPS FOR HIM BEHIND THEM THE
MALE AND FEMALE EGYPTIANS PELL MELL WITH THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN
CRYING ON THEIR SHOULDERS ALL DUKE COUNTS AND POPULACE IN RAGS AND
TATTERS
THEN CAME THE KINGDOM OF ARGOT THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE THIEVES
OF FRANCE ARRANGED ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF THEIR DIGNITY THE MINOR
PEOPLE WALKING FIRST
THUS DEFILED BY FOURS WITH THE DIVERS INSIGNIA OF
THEIR GRADES IN THAT STRANGE FACULTY MOST OF THEM LAME SOME
CRIPPLES OTHERS ONE ARMED SHOP CLERKS PILGRIM HUBINS BOOTBLACKS
THIMBLE RIGGERS STREET ARABS BEGGARS THE BLEAR EYED BEGGARS THIEVES
THE WEAKLY VAGABONDS MERCHANTS SHAM SOLDIERS GOLDSMITHS PASSED
MASTERS OF PICKPOCKETS ISOLATED THIEVES
A CATALOGUE THAT WOULD
WEARY HOMER
IN THE CENTRE OF THE CONCLAVE OF THE PASSED MASTERS OF
PICKPOCKETS ONE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN DISTINGUISHING THE KING OF
ARGOT THE GRAND COSRE SO CALLED CROUCHING IN A LITTLE CART DRAWN
BY TWO BIG DOGS
AFTER THE KINGDOM OF THE ARGOTIERS CAME THE EMPIRE OF
GALILEE
GUILLAUME ROUSSEAU EMPEROR OF THE EMPIRE OF GALILEE MARCHED
MAJESTICALLY IN HIS ROBE OF PURPLE SPOTTED WITH WINE PRECEDED BY
BUFFOONS WRESTLING AND EXECUTING MILITARY DANCES SURROUNDED BY HIS
MACEBEARERS HIS PICKPOCKETS AND CLERKS OF THE CHAMBER OF ACCOUNTS
LAST
OF ALL CAME THE CORPORATION OF LAW CLERKS WITH ITS MAYPOLES CROWNED
WITH FLOWERS ITS BLACK ROBES ITS MUSIC WORTHY OF THE ORGY AND ITS
LARGE CANDLES OF YELLOW WAX
IN THE CENTRE OF THIS CROWD THE GRAND
OFFICERS OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF FOOLS BORE ON THEIR SHOULDERS A LITTER
MORE LOADED DOWN WITH CANDLES THAN THE RELIQUARY OF SAINTE GENEVIVE IN
TIME OF PEST AND ON THIS LITTER SHONE RESPLENDENT WITH CROSIER COPE
AND MITRE THE NEW POPE OF THE FOOLS THE BELLRINGER OF NOTRE DAME
QUASIMODO THE HUNCHBACK
EACH SECTION OF THIS GROTESQUE PROCESSION HAD ITS OWN MUSIC
THE
EGYPTIANS MADE THEIR DRUMS AND AFRICAN TAMBOURINES RESOUND
THE SLANG
MEN NOT A VERY MUSICAL RACE STILL CLUNG TO THE GOAT'S HORN TRUMPET AND
THE GOTHIC RUBEBBE OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY
THE EMPIRE OF GALILEE WAS NOT
MUCH MORE ADVANCED AMONG ITS MUSIC ONE COULD HARDLY DISTINGUISH SOME
MISERABLE REBEC FROM THE INFANCY OF THE ART STILL IMPRISONED IN THE
RE LA MI
BUT IT WAS AROUND THE POPE OF THE FOOLS THAT ALL THE MUSICAL
RICHES OF THE EPOCH WERE DISPLAYED IN A MAGNIFICENT DISCORD
IT WAS
NOTHING BUT SOPRANO REBECS COUNTER TENOR REBECS AND TENOR REBECS
NOT TO RECKON THE FLUTES AND BRASS INSTRUMENTS
ALAS OUR READERS WILL
REMEMBER THAT THIS WAS GRINGOIRE'S ORCHESTRA
IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONVEY AN IDEA OF THE DEGREE OF PROUD AND BLISSFUL
EXPANSION TO WHICH THE SAD AND HIDEOUS VISAGE OF QUASIMODO HAD ATTAINED
DURING THE TRANSIT FROM THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE TO THE PLACE DE GRVE
IT
WAS THE FIRST ENJOYMENT OF SELF LOVE THAT HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED
DOWN
TO THAT DAY HE HAD KNOWN ONLY HUMILIATION DISDAIN FOR HIS CONDITION
DISGUST FOR HIS PERSON
HENCE DEAF THOUGH HE WAS HE ENJOYED LIKE A
VERITABLE POPE THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THAT THRONG WHICH HE HATED BECAUSE
HE FELT THAT HE WAS HATED BY IT
WHAT MATTERED IT THAT HIS PEOPLE
CONSISTED OF A PACK OF FOOLS CRIPPLES THIEVES AND BEGGARS IT WAS
STILL A PEOPLE AND HE WAS ITS SOVEREIGN
AND HE ACCEPTED SERIOUSLY ALL
THIS IRONICAL APPLAUSE ALL THIS DERISIVE RESPECT WITH WHICH THE CROWD
MINGLED IT MUST BE ADMITTED A GOOD DEAL OF VERY REAL FEAR
FOR THE
HUNCHBACK WAS ROBUST FOR THE BANDY LEGGED FELLOW WAS AGILE FOR THE
DEAF MAN WAS MALICIOUS THREE QUALITIES WHICH TEMPER RIDICULE
WE ARE FAR FROM BELIEVING HOWEVER THAT THE NEW POPE OF THE FOOLS
UNDERSTOOD BOTH THE SENTIMENTS WHICH HE FELT AND THE SENTIMENTS WHICH
HE INSPIRED
THE SPIRIT WHICH WAS LODGED IN THIS FAILURE OF A BODY HAD
NECESSARILY SOMETHING INCOMPLETE AND DEAF ABOUT IT
THUS WHAT HE FELT
AT THE MOMENT WAS TO HIM ABSOLUTELY VAGUE INDISTINCT AND CONFUSED
ONLY JOY MADE ITSELF FELT ONLY PRIDE DOMINATED
AROUND THAT SOMBRE AND
UNHAPPY FACE THERE HUNG A RADIANCE
IT WAS THEN NOT WITHOUT SURPRISE AND ALARM THAT AT THE VERY MOMENT
WHEN QUASIMODO WAS PASSING THE PILLAR HOUSE IN THAT SEMI INTOXICATED
STATE A MAN WAS SEEN TO DART FROM THE CROWD AND TO TEAR FROM HIS
HANDS WITH A GESTURE OF ANGER HIS CROSIER OF GILDED WOOD THE EMBLEM
OF HIS MOCK POPESHIP
THIS MAN THIS RASH INDIVIDUAL WAS THE MAN WITH THE BALD BROW WHO
A MOMENT EARLIER STANDING WITH THE GYPSY'S GROUP HAD CHILLED THE
POOR GIRL WITH HIS WORDS OF MENACE AND OF HATRED
HE WAS DRESSED IN
AN ECCLESIASTICAL COSTUME
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE STOOD FORTH FROM THE
CROWD GRINGOIRE WHO HAD NOT NOTICED HIM UP TO THAT TIME RECOGNIZED
HIM HOLD HE SAID WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT
EH 'TIS MY
MASTER IN HERMES DOM CLAUDE FROLLO THE ARCHDEACON WHAT THE DEVIL DOES
HE WANT OF THAT OLD ONE EYED FELLOW HE'LL GET HIMSELF DEVOURED
A CRY OF TERROR AROSE IN FACT
THE FORMIDABLE QUASIMODO HAD HURLED
HIMSELF FROM THE LITTER AND THE WOMEN TURNED ASIDE THEIR EYES IN ORDER
NOT TO SEE HIM TEAR THE ARCHDEACON ASUNDER
HE MADE ONE BOUND AS FAR AS THE PRIEST LOOKED AT HIM AND FELL UPON HIS
KNEES
THE PRIEST TORE OFF HIS TIARA BROKE HIS CROZIER AND RENT HIS TINSEL
COPE
QUASIMODO REMAINED ON HIS KNEES WITH HEAD BENT AND HANDS CLASPED
THEN THERE WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM A STRANGE DIALOGUE OF SIGNS
AND GESTURES FOR NEITHER OF THEM SPOKE
THE PRIEST ERECT ON HIS
FEET IRRITATED THREATENING IMPERIOUS QUASIMODO PROSTRATE HUMBLE
SUPPLIANT
AND NEVERTHELESS IT IS CERTAIN THAT QUASIMODO COULD HAVE
CRUSHED THE PRIEST WITH HIS THUMB
AT LENGTH THE ARCHDEACON GIVING QUASIMODO'S POWERFUL SHOULDER A ROUGH
SHAKE MADE HIM A SIGN TO RISE AND FOLLOW HIM
QUASIMODO ROSE
THEN THE BROTHERHOOD OF FOOLS THEIR FIRST STUPOR HAVING PASSED OFF
WISHED TO DEFEND THEIR POPE SO ABRUPTLY DETHRONED
THE EGYPTIANS THE
MEN OF SLANG AND ALL THE FRATERNITY OF LAW CLERKS GATHERED HOWLING
ROUND THE PRIEST
QUASIMODO PLACED HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE PRIEST SET IN PLAY THE MUSCLES
OF HIS ATHLETIC FISTS AND GLARED UPON THE ASSAILANTS WITH THE SNARL OF
AN ANGRY TIGER
THE PRIEST RESUMED HIS SOMBRE GRAVITY MADE A SIGN TO QUASIMODO AND
RETIRED IN SILENCE
QUASIMODO WALKED IN FRONT OF HIM SCATTERING THE CROWD AS HE PASSED
WHEN THEY HAD TRAVERSED THE POPULACE AND THE PLACE THE CLOUD OF CURIOUS
AND IDLE WERE MINDED TO FOLLOW THEM
QUASIMODO THEN CONSTITUTED HIMSELF
THE REARGUARD AND FOLLOWED THE ARCHDEACON WALKING BACKWARDS SQUAT
SURLY MONSTROUS BRISTLING GATHERING UP HIS LIMBS LICKING HIS BOAR'S
TUSKS GROWLING LIKE A WILD BEAST AND IMPARTING TO THE CROWD IMMENSE
VIBRATIONS WITH A LOOK OR A GESTURE
BOTH WERE ALLOWED TO PLUNGE INTO A DARK AND NARROW STREET WHERE NO
ONE DARED TO VENTURE AFTER THEM SO THOROUGHLY DID THE MERE CHIMERA OF
QUASIMODO GNASHING HIS TEETH BAR THE ENTRANCE
HERE'S A MARVELLOUS THING SAID GRINGOIRE BUT WHERE THE DEUCE SHALL
I FIND SOME SUPPER
CHAPTER IV
THE INCONVENIENCES OF FOLLOWING A PRETTY WOMAN THROUGH THE
STREETS IN THE EVENING
GRINGOIRE SET OUT TO FOLLOW THE GYPSY AT ALL HAZARDS
HE HAD SEEN HER
ACCOMPANIED BY HER GOAT TAKE TO THE RUE DE LA COUTELLERIE HE TOOK THE
RUE DE LA COUTELLERIE
WHY NOT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
GRINGOIRE A PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHER OF THE STREETS OF PARIS HAD NOTICED
THAT NOTHING IS MORE PROPITIOUS TO REVERY THAN FOLLOWING A PRETTY
WOMAN WITHOUT KNOWING WHITHER SHE IS GOING
THERE WAS IN THIS VOLUNTARY
ABDICATION OF HIS FREEWILL IN THIS FANCY SUBMITTING ITSELF TO ANOTHER
FANCY WHICH SUSPECTS IT NOT A MIXTURE OF FANTASTIC INDEPENDENCE AND
BLIND OBEDIENCE SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN SLAVERY
AND LIBERTY WHICH PLEASED GRINGOIRE A SPIRIT ESSENTIALLY COMPOUND
UNDECIDED AND COMPLEX HOLDING THE EXTREMITIES OF ALL EXTREMES
INCESSANTLY SUSPENDED BETWEEN ALL HUMAN PROPENSITIES AND NEUTRALIZING
ONE BY THE OTHER
HE WAS FOND OF COMPARING HIMSELF TO MAHOMET'S COFFIN
ATTRACTED IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BY TWO LOADSTONES AND HESITATING
ETERNALLY BETWEEN THE HEIGHTS AND THE DEPTHS BETWEEN THE VAULT AND THE
PAVEMENT BETWEEN FALL AND ASCENT BETWEEN ZENITH AND NADIR
IF GRINGOIRE HAD LIVED IN OUR DAY WHAT A FINE MIDDLE COURSE HE WOULD
HOLD BETWEEN CLASSICISM AND ROMANTICISM
BUT HE WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY PRIMITIVE TO LIVE THREE HUNDRED YEARS
AND 'TIS A PITY
HIS ABSENCE IS A VOID WHICH IS BUT TOO SENSIBLY FELT
TO DAY
MOREOVER FOR THE PURPOSE OF THUS FOLLOWING PASSERS BY AND ESPECIALLY
FEMALE PASSERS BY IN THE STREETS WHICH GRINGOIRE WAS FOND OF DOING
THERE IS NO BETTER DISPOSITION THAN IGNORANCE OF WHERE ONE IS GOING TO
SLEEP
SO HE WALKED ALONG VERY THOUGHTFULLY BEHIND THE YOUNG GIRL WHO
HASTENED HER PACE AND MADE HER GOAT TROT AS SHE SAW THE BOURGEOIS
RETURNING HOME AND THE TAVERNS THE ONLY SHOPS WHICH HAD BEEN OPEN THAT
DAY CLOSING
AFTER ALL HE HALF THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SHE MUST LODGE SOMEWHERE
GYPSIES HAVE KINDLY HEARTS
WHO KNOWS
AND IN THE POINTS OF SUSPENSE WHICH HE PLACED AFTER THIS RETICENCE IN
HIS MIND THERE LAY I KNOW NOT WHAT FLATTERING IDEAS
MEANWHILE FROM TIME TO TIME AS HE PASSED THE LAST GROUPS OF BOURGEOIS
CLOSING THEIR DOORS HE CAUGHT SOME SCRAPS OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH
BROKE THE THREAD OF HIS PLEASANT HYPOTHESES
NOW IT WAS TWO OLD MEN ACCOSTING EACH OTHER
DO YOU KNOW THAT IT IS COLD MASTER THIBAUT FERNICLE GRINGOIRE HAD
BEEN AWARE OF THIS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WINTER
YES INDEED MASTER BONIFACE DISOME ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A WINTER
SUCH AS WE HAD THREE YEARS AGO IN '80 WHEN WOOD COST EIGHT SOUS THE
MEASURE
BAH THAT'S NOTHING MASTER THIBAUT COMPARED WITH THE WINTER OF 1407
WHEN IT FROZE FROM ST
MARTIN'S DAY UNTIL CANDLEMAS AND SO COLD THAT
THE PEN OF THE REGISTRAR OF THE PARLIAMENT FROZE EVERY THREE WORDS IN
THE GRAND CHAMBER WHICH INTERRUPTED THE REGISTRATION OF JUSTICE
FURTHER ON THERE WERE TWO FEMALE NEIGHBORS AT THEIR WINDOWS HOLDING
CANDLES WHICH THE FOG CAUSED TO SPUTTER
HAS YOUR HUSBAND TOLD YOU ABOUT THE MISHAP MADEMOISELLE LA BOUDRAQUE
NO
WHAT IS IT MADEMOISELLE TURQUANT
THE HORSE OF M
GILLES GODIN THE NOTARY AT THE CHTELET TOOK FRIGHT
AT THE FLEMINGS AND THEIR PROCESSION AND OVERTURNED MASTER PHILIPPE
AVRILLOT LAY MONK OF THE CLESTINS
REALLY
ACTUALLY
A BOURGEOIS HORSE 'TIS RATHER TOO MUCH IF IT HAD BEEN A CAVALRY
HORSE WELL AND GOOD
AND THE WINDOWS WERE CLOSED
BUT GRINGOIRE HAD LOST THE THREAD OF HIS
IDEAS NEVERTHELESS
FORTUNATELY HE SPEEDILY FOUND IT AGAIN AND HE KNOTTED IT TOGETHER
WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THANKS TO THE GYPSY THANKS TO DJALI WHO STILL
WALKED IN FRONT OF HIM TWO FINE DELICATE AND CHARMING CREATURES
WHOSE TINY FEET BEAUTIFUL FORMS AND GRACEFUL MANNERS HE WAS ENGAGED IN
ADMIRING ALMOST CONFUSING THEM IN HIS CONTEMPLATION BELIEVING THEM
TO BE BOTH YOUNG GIRLS FROM THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND GOOD FRIENDSHIP
REGARDING THEM BOTH AS GOATS SO FAR AS THE LIGHTNESS AGILITY AND
DEXTERITY OF THEIR WALK WERE CONCERNED
BUT THE STREETS WERE BECOMING BLACKER AND MORE DESERTED EVERY MOMENT
THE CURFEW HAD SOUNDED LONG AGO AND IT WAS ONLY AT RARE INTERVALS
NOW THAT THEY ENCOUNTERED A PASSER BY IN THE STREET OR A LIGHT IN THE
WINDOWS
GRINGOIRE HAD BECOME INVOLVED IN HIS PURSUIT OF THE GYPSY IN
THAT INEXTRICABLE LABYRINTH OF ALLEYS SQUARES AND CLOSED COURTS
WHICH SURROUND THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRE OF THE SAINTS INNOCENTS AND WHICH
RESEMBLES A BALL OF THREAD TANGLED BY A CAT
HERE ARE STREETS WHICH
POSSESS BUT LITTLE LOGIC SAID GRINGOIRE LOST IN THE THOUSANDS OF
CIRCUITS WHICH RETURNED UPON THEMSELVES INCESSANTLY BUT WHERE THE YOUNG
GIRL PURSUED A ROAD WHICH SEEMED FAMILIAR TO HER WITHOUT HESITATION AND
WITH A STEP WHICH BECAME EVER MORE RAPID
AS FOR HIM HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
UTTERLY IGNORANT OF HIS SITUATION HAD HE NOT ESPIED IN PASSING AT THE
TURN OF A STREET THE OCTAGONAL MASS OF THE PILLORY OF THE FISH MARKETS
THE OPEN WORK SUMMIT OF WHICH THREW ITS BLACK FRETTED OUTLINES CLEARLY
UPON A WINDOW WHICH WAS STILL LIGHTED IN THE RUE VERDELET
THE YOUNG GIRL'S ATTENTION HAD BEEN ATTRACTED TO HIM FOR THE LAST FEW
MOMENTS SHE HAD REPEATEDLY TURNED HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM WITH UNEASINESS
SHE HAD EVEN ONCE COME TO A STANDSTILL AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A RAY OF
LIGHT WHICH ESCAPED FROM A HALF OPEN BAKERY TO SURVEY HIM INTENTLY FROM
HEAD TO FOOT THEN HAVING CAST THIS GLANCE GRINGOIRE HAD SEEN HER MAKE
THAT LITTLE POUT WHICH HE HAD ALREADY NOTICED AFTER WHICH SHE PASSED
ON
THIS LITTLE POUT HAD FURNISHED GRINGOIRE WITH FOOD FOR THOUGHT
THERE
WAS CERTAINLY BOTH DISDAIN AND MOCKERY IN THAT GRACEFUL GRIMACE
SO HE
DROPPED HIS HEAD BEGAN TO COUNT THE PAVING STONES AND TO FOLLOW THE
YOUNG GIRL AT A LITTLE GREATER DISTANCE WHEN AT THE TURN OF A STREET
WHICH HAD CAUSED HIM TO LOSE SIGHT OF HER HE HEARD HER UTTER A PIERCING
CRY
HE HASTENED HIS STEPS
THE STREET WAS FULL OF SHADOWS
NEVERTHELESS A TWIST OF TOW SOAKED IN
OIL WHICH BURNED IN A CAGE AT THE FEET OF THE HOLY VIRGIN AT THE STREET
CORNER PERMITTED GRINGOIRE TO MAKE OUT THE GYPSY STRUGGLING IN THE ARMS
OF TWO MEN WHO WERE ENDEAVORING TO STIFLE HER CRIES
THE POOR LITTLE
GOAT IN GREAT ALARM LOWERED HIS HORNS AND BLEATED
HELP GENTLEMEN OF THE WATCH SHOUTED GRINGOIRE AND ADVANCED BRAVELY
ONE OF THE MEN WHO HELD THE YOUNG GIRL TURNED TOWARDS HIM
IT WAS THE
FORMIDABLE VISAGE OF QUASIMODO
GRINGOIRE DID NOT TAKE TO FLIGHT BUT NEITHER DID HE ADVANCE ANOTHER
STEP
QUASIMODO CAME UP TO HIM TOSSED HIM FOUR PACES AWAY ON THE PAVEMENT
WITH A BACKWARD TURN OF THE HAND AND PLUNGED RAPIDLY INTO THE GLOOM
BEARING THE YOUNG GIRL FOLDED ACROSS ONE ARM LIKE A SILKEN SCARF
HIS
COMPANION FOLLOWED HIM AND THE POOR GOAT RAN AFTER THEM ALL BLEATING
PLAINTIVELY
MURDER MURDER SHRIEKED THE UNHAPPY GYPSY
HALT RASCALS AND YIELD ME THAT WENCH SUDDENLY SHOUTED IN A VOICE OF
THUNDER A CAVALIER WHO APPEARED SUDDENLY FROM A NEIGHBORING SQUARE
IT WAS A CAPTAIN OF THE KING'S ARCHERS ARMED FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH
HIS SWORD IN HIS HAND
HE TORE THE GYPSY FROM THE ARMS OF THE DAZED QUASIMODO THREW HER ACROSS
HIS SADDLE AND AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TERRIBLE HUNCHBACK RECOVERING
FROM HIS SURPRISE RUSHED UPON HIM TO REGAIN HIS PREY FIFTEEN OR
SIXTEEN ARCHERS WHO FOLLOWED THEIR CAPTAIN CLOSELY MADE THEIR
APPEARANCE WITH THEIR TWO EDGED SWORDS IN THEIR FISTS
IT WAS A SQUAD
OF THE KING'S POLICE WHICH WAS MAKING THE ROUNDS BY ORDER OF MESSIRE
ROBERT D'ESTOUTEVILLE GUARD OF THE PROVOSTSHIP OF PARIS
QUASIMODO WAS SURROUNDED SEIZED GARROTED HE ROARED HE FOAMED AT THE
MOUTH HE BIT AND HAD IT BEEN BROAD DAYLIGHT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT
HIS FACE ALONE RENDERED MORE HIDEOUS BY WRATH WOULD HAVE PUT THE
ENTIRE SQUAD TO FLIGHT
BUT BY NIGHT HE WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS MOST
FORMIDABLE WEAPON HIS UGLINESS
HIS COMPANION HAD DISAPPEARED DURING THE STRUGGLE
THE GYPSY GRACEFULLY RAISED HERSELF UPRIGHT UPON THE OFFICER'S SADDLE
PLACED BOTH HANDS UPON THE YOUNG MAN'S SHOULDERS AND GAZED FIXEDLY AT
HIM FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AS THOUGH ENCHANTED WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS AND
WITH THE AID WHICH HE HAD JUST RENDERED HER
THEN BREAKING SILENCE
FIRST SHE SAID TO HIM MAKING HER SWEET VOICE STILL SWEETER THAN
USUAL
WHAT IS YOUR NAME MONSIEUR LE GENDARME
CAPTAIN PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS AT YOUR SERVICE MY BEAUTY REPLIED
THE OFFICER DRAWING HIMSELF UP
THANKS SAID SHE
AND WHILE CAPTAIN PHOEBUS WAS TURNING UP HIS MOUSTACHE IN BURGUNDIAN
FASHION SHE SLIPPED FROM THE HORSE LIKE AN ARROW FALLING TO EARTH AND
FLED
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING WOULD HAVE VANISHED LESS QUICKLY
NOMBRILL OF THE POPE SAID THE CAPTAIN CAUSING QUASIMODO'S STRAPS TO
BE DRAWN TIGHTER I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO KEEP THE WENCH
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE CAPTAIN SAID ONE GENDARME
THE WARBLER HAS
FLED AND THE BAT REMAINS
CHAPTER V
RESULT OF THE DANGERS
GRINGOIRE THOROUGHLY STUNNED BY HIS FALL REMAINED ON THE PAVEMENT
IN FRONT OF THE HOLY VIRGIN AT THE STREET CORNER
LITTLE BY LITTLE HE
REGAINED HIS SENSES AT FIRST FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE WAS FLOATING IN A
SORT OF HALF SOMNOLENT REVERY WHICH WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS CHARM IN WHICH
AERIEL FIGURES OF THE GYPSY AND HER GOAT WERE COUPLED WITH QUASIMODO'S
HEAVY FIST
THIS STATE LASTED BUT A SHORT TIME
A DECIDEDLY VIVID
SENSATION OF COLD IN THE PART OF HIS BODY WHICH WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE
PAVEMENT SUDDENLY AROUSED HIM AND CAUSED HIS SPIRIT TO RETURN TO THE
SURFACE
WHENCE COMES THIS CHILL HE SAID ABRUPTLY TO HIMSELF
HE THEN
PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS LYING HALF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUTTER
THAT DEVIL OF A HUNCHBACKED CYCLOPS HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
AND HE TRIED TO RISE
BUT HE WAS TOO MUCH DAZED AND BRUISED HE WAS
FORCED TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS
MOREOVER HIS HAND WAS TOLERABLY FREE HE
STOPPED UP HIS NOSE AND RESIGNED HIMSELF
THE MUD OF PARIS HE SAID TO HIMSELF FOR DECIDEDLY HE THOUGHT THAT HE
WAS SURE THAT THE GUTTER WOULD PROVE HIS REFUGE FOR THE NIGHT AND WHAT
CAN ONE DO IN A REFUGE EXCEPT DREAM THE MUD OF PARIS IS PARTICULARLY
STINKING IT MUST CONTAIN A GREAT DEAL OF VOLATILE AND NITRIC SALTS
THAT MOREOVER IS THE OPINION OF MASTER NICHOLAS FLAMEL AND OF THE
ALCHEMISTS
THE WORD ALCHEMISTS SUDDENLY SUGGESTED TO HIS MIND THE IDEA OF
ARCHDEACON CLAUDE FROLLO
HE RECALLED THE VIOLENT SCENE WHICH HE HAD
JUST WITNESSED IN PART THAT THE GYPSY WAS STRUGGLING WITH TWO MEN
THAT QUASIMODO HAD A COMPANION AND THE MOROSE AND HAUGHTY FACE OF
THE ARCHDEACON PASSED CONFUSEDLY THROUGH HIS MEMORY
THAT WOULD BE
STRANGE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
AND ON THAT FACT AND THAT BASIS HE BEGAN
TO CONSTRUCT A FANTASTIC EDIFICE OF HYPOTHESIS THAT CARD CASTLE OF
PHILOSOPHERS THEN SUDDENLY RETURNING ONCE MORE TO REALITY COME I'M
FREEZING HE EJACULATED
THE PLACE WAS IN FACT BECOMING LESS AND LESS TENABLE
EACH MOLECULE
OF THE GUTTER BORE AWAY A MOLECULE OF HEAT RADIATING FROM GRINGOIRE'S
LOINS AND THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE TEMPERATURE OF HIS BODY AND THE
TEMPERATURE OF THE BROOK BEGAN TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ROUGH FASHION
QUITE A DIFFERENT ANNOYANCE SUDDENLY ASSAILED HIM
A GROUP OF CHILDREN
THOSE LITTLE BARE FOOTED SAVAGES WHO HAVE ALWAYS ROAMED THE PAVEMENTS
OF PARIS UNDER THE ETERNAL NAME OF GAMINS AND WHO WHEN WE WERE ALSO
CHILDREN OURSELVES THREW STONES AT ALL OF US IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN WE
CAME OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE OUR TROUSERS WERE NOT TORN A SWARM OF THESE
YOUNG SCAMPS RUSHED TOWARDS THE SQUARE WHERE GRINGOIRE LAY WITH SHOUTS
AND LAUGHTER WHICH SEEMED TO PAY BUT LITTLE HEED TO THE SLEEP OF THE
NEIGHBORS
THEY WERE DRAGGING AFTER THEM SOME SORT OF HIDEOUS SACK
AND THE NOISE OF THEIR WOODEN SHOES ALONE WOULD HAVE ROUSED THE DEAD
GRINGOIRE WHO WAS NOT QUITE DEAD YET HALF RAISED HIMSELF
OH HENNEQUIN DANDCHE OH JEHAN PINCEBOURDE THEY SHOUTED IN
DEAFENING TONES OLD EUSTACHE MOUBON THE MERCHANT AT THE CORNER HAS
JUST DIED
WE'VE GOT HIS STRAW PALLET WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BONFIRE OUT
OF IT
IT'S THE TURN OF THE FLEMISH TO DAY
AND BEHOLD THEY FLUNG THE PALLET DIRECTLY UPON GRINGOIRE BESIDE WHOM
THEY HAD ARRIVED WITHOUT ESPYING HIM
AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THEM
TOOK A HANDFUL OF STRAW AND SET OFF TO LIGHT IT AT THE WICK OF THE GOOD
VIRGIN
S'DEATH GROWLED GRINGOIRE AM I GOING TO BE TOO WARM NOW
IT WAS A CRITICAL MOMENT
HE WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN FIRE AND WATER HE MADE
A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT THE EFFORT OF A COUNTERFEITER OF MONEY WHO IS ON
THE POINT OF BEING BOILED AND WHO SEEKS TO ESCAPE
HE ROSE TO HIS FEET
FLUNG ASIDE THE STRAW PALLET UPON THE STREET URCHINS AND FLED
HOLY VIRGIN SHRIEKED THE CHILDREN 'TIS THE MERCHANT'S GHOST
AND THEY FLED IN THEIR TURN
THE STRAW MATTRESS REMAINED MASTER OF THE FIELD
BELLEFORET FATHER
LE JUGE AND CORROZET AFFIRM THAT IT WAS PICKED UP ON THE MORROW WITH
GREAT POMP BY THE CLERGY OF THE QUARTER AND BORNE TO THE TREASURY
OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT OPPORTUNE WHERE THE SACRISTAN EVEN AS LATE AS
1789 EARNED A TOLERABLY HANDSOME REVENUE OUT OF THE GREAT MIRACLE OF
THE STATUE OF THE VIRGIN AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE MAUCONSEIL WHICH
HAD BY ITS MERE PRESENCE ON THE MEMORABLE NIGHT BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND
SEVENTH OF JANUARY 1482 EXORCISED THE DEFUNCT EUSTACHE MOUBON WHO
IN ORDER TO PLAY A TRICK ON THE DEVIL HAD AT HIS DEATH MALICIOUSLY
CONCEALED HIS SOUL IN HIS STRAW PALLET
CHAPTER VI
THE BROKEN JUG
AFTER HAVING RUN FOR SOME TIME AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED WITHOUT KNOWING
WHITHER KNOCKING HIS HEAD AGAINST MANY A STREET CORNER LEAPING MANY A
GUTTER TRAVERSING MANY AN ALLEY MANY A COURT MANY A SQUARE SEEKING
FLIGHT AND PASSAGE THROUGH ALL THE MEANDERINGS OF THE ANCIENT PASSAGES
OF THE HALLES EXPLORING IN HIS PANIC TERROR WHAT THE FINE LATIN OF THE
MAPS CALLS TOTA VIA CHEMINUM ET VIARIA OUR POET SUDDENLY HALTED FOR
LACK OF BREATH IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IN THE SECOND BECAUSE HE HAD
BEEN COLLARED AFTER A FASHION BY A DILEMMA WHICH HAD JUST OCCURRED TO
HIS MIND
IT STRIKES ME MASTER PIERRE GRINGOIRE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
PLACING HIS FINGER TO HIS BROW THAT YOU ARE RUNNING LIKE A MADMAN
THE
LITTLE SCAMPS ARE NO LESS AFRAID OF YOU THAN YOU ARE OF THEM
IT STRIKES
ME I SAY THAT YOU HEARD THE CLATTER OF THEIR WOODEN SHOES FLEEING
SOUTHWARD WHILE YOU WERE FLEEING NORTHWARD
NOW ONE OF TWO THINGS
EITHER THEY HAVE TAKEN FLIGHT AND THE PALLET WHICH THEY MUST HAVE
FORGOTTEN IN THEIR TERROR IS PRECISELY THAT HOSPITABLE BED IN SEARCH
OF WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN RUNNING EVER SINCE MORNING AND WHICH MADAME THE
VIRGIN MIRACULOUSLY SENDS YOU IN ORDER TO RECOMPENSE YOU FOR HAVING
MADE A MORALITY IN HER HONOR ACCOMPANIED BY TRIUMPHS AND MUMMERIES OR
THE CHILDREN HAVE NOT TAKEN FLIGHT AND IN THAT CASE THEY HAVE PUT THE
BRAND TO THE PALLET AND THAT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD FIRE WHICH YOU NEED
TO CHEER DRY AND WARM YOU
IN EITHER CASE GOOD FIRE OR GOOD BED THAT
STRAW PALLET IS A GIFT FROM HEAVEN
THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARIE WHO STANDS
AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE MAUCONSEIL COULD ONLY HAVE MADE EUSTACHE
MOUBON DIE FOR THAT EXPRESS PURPOSE AND IT IS FOLLY ON YOUR PART TO
FLEE THUS ZIGZAG LIKE A PICARD BEFORE A FRENCHMAN LEAVING BEHIND YOU
WHAT YOU SEEK BEFORE YOU AND YOU ARE A FOOL
THEN HE RETRACED HIS STEPS AND FEELING HIS WAY AND SEARCHING WITH HIS
NOSE TO THE WIND AND HIS EARS ON THE ALERT HE TRIED TO FIND THE
BLESSED PALLET AGAIN BUT IN VAIN
THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE FOUND BUT
INTERSECTIONS OF HOUSES CLOSED COURTS AND CROSSINGS OF STREETS IN
THE MIDST OF WHICH HE HESITATED AND DOUBTED INCESSANTLY BEING MORE
PERPLEXED AND ENTANGLED IN THIS MEDLEY OF STREETS THAN HE WOULD HAVE
BEEN EVEN IN THE LABYRINTH OF THE HTEL DES TOURNELLES
AT LENGTH HE
LOST PATIENCE AND EXCLAIMED SOLEMNLY CURSED BE CROSS ROADS 'TIS THE
DEVIL WHO HAS MADE THEM IN THE SHAPE OF HIS PITCHFORK
THIS EXCLAMATION AFFORDED HIM A LITTLE SOLACE AND A SORT OF REDDISH
REFLECTION WHICH HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF AT THAT MOMENT AT THE EXTREMITY OF
A LONG AND NARROW LANE COMPLETED THE ELEVATION OF HIS MORAL TONE
GOD
BE PRAISED SAID HE THERE IT IS YONDER THERE IS MY PALLET BURNING
AND COMPARING HIMSELF TO THE PILOT WHO SUFFERS SHIPWRECK BY NIGHT
SALVE HE ADDED PIOUSLY SALVE MARIS STELLA
DID HE ADDRESS THIS FRAGMENT OF LITANY TO THE HOLY VIRGIN OR TO THE
PALLET WE ARE UTTERLY UNABLE TO SAY
HE HAD TAKEN BUT A FEW STEPS IN THE LONG STREET WHICH SLOPED DOWNWARDS
WAS UNPAVED AND MORE AND MORE MUDDY AND STEEP WHEN HE NOTICED A VERY
SINGULAR THING
IT WAS NOT DESERTED HERE AND THERE ALONG ITS EXTENT
CRAWLED CERTAIN VAGUE AND FORMLESS MASSES ALL DIRECTING THEIR COURSE
TOWARDS THE LIGHT WHICH FLICKERED AT THE END OF THE STREET LIKE THOSE
HEAVY INSECTS WHICH DRAG ALONG BY NIGHT FROM BLADE TO BLADE OF GRASS
TOWARDS THE SHEPHERD'S FIRE
NOTHING RENDERS ONE SO ADVENTUROUS AS NOT BEING ABLE TO FEEL THE PLACE
WHERE ONE'S POCKET IS SITUATED
GRINGOIRE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE AND HAD
SOON JOINED THAT ONE OF THE FORMS WHICH DRAGGED ALONG MOST INDOLENTLY
BEHIND THE OTHERS
ON DRAWING NEAR HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NOTHING
ELSE THAN A WRETCHED LEGLESS CRIPPLE IN A BOWL WHO WAS HOPPING ALONG ON
HIS TWO HANDS LIKE A WOUNDED FIELD SPIDER WHICH HAS BUT TWO LEGS LEFT
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE PASSED CLOSE TO THIS SPECIES OF SPIDER WITH A
HUMAN COUNTENANCE IT RAISED TOWARDS HIM A LAMENTABLE VOICE LA BUONA
MANCIA SIGNOR LA BUONA MANCIA
ALMS
DEUCE TAKE YOU SAID GRINGOIRE AND ME WITH YOU IF I KNOW WHAT YOU
MEAN
AND HE PASSED ON
HE OVERTOOK ANOTHER OF THESE ITINERANT MASSES AND EXAMINED IT
IT WAS
AN IMPOTENT MAN BOTH HALT AND CRIPPLED AND HALT AND CRIPPLED TO SUCH
A DEGREE THAT THE COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF CRUTCHES AND WOODEN LEGS WHICH
SUSTAINED HIM GAVE HIM THE AIR OF A MASON'S SCAFFOLDING ON THE MARCH
GRINGOIRE WHO LIKED NOBLE AND CLASSICAL COMPARISONS COMPARED HIM IN
THOUGHT TO THE LIVING TRIPOD OF VULCAN
THIS LIVING TRIPOD SALUTED HIM AS HE PASSED BUT STOPPING HIS HAT ON A
LEVEL WITH GRINGOIRE'S CHIN LIKE A SHAVING DISH WHILE HE SHOUTED IN
THE LATTER'S EARS SENOR CABELLERO PARA COMPRAR UN PEDASO DE PAN
GIVE ME THE MEANS TO BUY A BIT OF BREAD SIR
IT APPEARS SAID GRINGOIRE THAT THIS ONE CAN ALSO TALK BUT 'TIS A
RUDE LANGUAGE AND HE IS MORE FORTUNATE THAN I IF HE UNDERSTANDS IT
THEN SMITING HIS BROW IN A SUDDEN TRANSITION OF IDEAS BY THE WAY
WHAT THE DEUCE DID THEY MEAN THIS MORNING WITH THEIR ESMERALDA
HE WAS MINDED TO AUGMENT HIS PACE BUT FOR THE THIRD TIME SOMETHING
BARRED HIS WAY
THIS SOMETHING OR RATHER SOME ONE WAS A BLIND MAN A
LITTLE BLIND FELLOW WITH A BEARDED JEWISH FACE WHO ROWING AWAY IN THE
SPACE ABOUT HIM WITH A STICK AND TOWED BY A LARGE DOG DRONED THROUGH
HIS NOSE WITH A HUNGARIAN ACCENT FACITOTE CARITATEM
WELL NOW SAID GRINGOIRE HERE'S ONE AT LAST WHO SPEAKS A CHRISTIAN
TONGUE
I MUST HAVE A VERY CHARITABLE ASPECT SINCE THEY ASK ALMS OF
ME IN THE PRESENT LEAN CONDITION OF MY PURSE
MY FRIEND AND HE TURNED
TOWARDS THE BLIND MAN I SOLD MY LAST SHIRT LAST WEEK THAT IS TO SAY
SINCE YOU UNDERSTAND ONLY THE LANGUAGE OF CICERO VENDIDI HEBDOMADE
NUPER TRANSITA MEAM ULTIMAM CHEMISAN
THAT SAID HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE BLIND MAN AND PURSUED HIS WAY
BUT THE BLIND MAN BEGAN TO INCREASE HIS STRIDE AT THE SAME TIME AND
BEHOLD THE CRIPPLE AND THE LEGLESS MAN IN HIS BOWL CAME UP ON THEIR
SIDE IN GREAT HASTE AND WITH GREAT CLAMOR OF BOWL AND CRUTCHES UPON
THE PAVEMENT
THEN ALL THREE JOSTLING EACH OTHER AT POOR GRINGOIRE'S
HEELS BEGAN TO SING THEIR SONG TO HIM
CARITATEM CHANTED THE BLIND MAN
LA BUONA MANCIA CHANTED THE CRIPPLE IN THE BOWL
AND THE LAME MAN TOOK UP THE MUSICAL PHRASE BY REPEATING UN PEDASO DE
PAN
GRINGOIRE STOPPED UP HIS EARS
OH TOWER OF BABEL HE EXCLAIMED
HE SET OUT TO RUN
THE BLIND MAN RAN THE LAME MAN RAN THE CRIPPLE IN
THE BOWL RAN
AND THEN IN PROPORTION AS HE PLUNGED DEEPER INTO THE STREET CRIPPLES
IN BOWLS BLIND MEN AND LAME MEN SWARMED ABOUT HIM AND MEN WITH ONE
ARM AND WITH ONE EYE AND THE LEPROUS WITH THEIR SORES SOME EMERGING
FROM LITTLE STREETS ADJACENT SOME FROM THE AIR HOLES OF CELLARS
HOWLING BELLOWING YELPING ALL LIMPING AND HALTING ALL FLINGING
THEMSELVES TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND HUMPED UP IN THE MIRE LIKE SNAILS
AFTER A SHOWER
GRINGOIRE STILL FOLLOWED BY HIS THREE PERSECUTORS AND NOT KNOWING
VERY WELL WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HIM MARCHED ALONG IN TERROR AMONG THEM
TURNING OUT FOR THE LAME STEPPING OVER THE CRIPPLES IN BOWLS WITH HIS
FEET IMBEDDED IN THAT ANT HILL OF LAME MEN LIKE THE ENGLISH CAPTAIN WHO
GOT CAUGHT IN THE QUICKSAND OF A SWARM OF CRABS
THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM OF MAKING AN EFFORT TO RETRACE HIS STEPS
BUT
IT WAS TOO LATE
THIS WHOLE LEGION HAD CLOSED IN BEHIND HIM AND HIS
THREE BEGGARS HELD HIM FAST
SO HE PROCEEDED IMPELLED BOTH BY THIS
IRRESISTIBLE FLOOD BY FEAR AND BY A VERTIGO WHICH CONVERTED ALL THIS
INTO A SORT OF HORRIBLE DREAM
AT LAST HE REACHED THE END OF THE STREET
IT OPENED UPON AN IMMENSE
PLACE WHERE A THOUSAND SCATTERED LIGHTS FLICKERED IN THE CONFUSED MISTS
OF NIGHT
GRINGOIRE FLEW THITHER HOPING TO ESCAPE BY THE SWIFTNESS OF
HIS LEGS FROM THE THREE INFIRM SPECTRES WHO HAD CLUTCHED HIM
ONDE VAS HOMBRE WHERE ARE YOU GOING MY MAN CRIED THE CRIPPLE
FLINGING AWAY HIS CRUTCHES AND RUNNING AFTER HIM WITH THE BEST LEGS
THAT EVER TRACED A GEOMETRICAL STEP UPON THE PAVEMENTS OF PARIS
IN THE MEANTIME THE LEGLESS MAN ERECT UPON HIS FEET CROWNED GRINGOIRE
WITH HIS HEAVY IRON BOWL AND THE BLIND MAN GLARED IN HIS FACE WITH
FLAMING EYES
WHERE AM I SAID THE TERRIFIED POET
IN THE COURT OF MIRACLES REPLIED A FOURTH SPECTRE WHO HAD ACCOSTED
THEM
UPON MY SOUL RESUMED GRINGOIRE I CERTAINLY DO BEHOLD THE BLIND WHO
SEE AND THE LAME WHO WALK BUT WHERE IS THE SAVIOUR
THEY REPLIED BY A BURST OF SINISTER LAUGHTER
THE POOR POET CAST HIS EYES ABOUT HIM
IT WAS IN TRUTH THAT
REDOUBTABLE COUR DES MIRACLES WHITHER AN HONEST MAN HAD NEVER
PENETRATED AT SUCH AN HOUR THE MAGIC CIRCLE WHERE THE OFFICERS OF THE
CHTELET AND THE SERGEANTS OF THE PROVOSTSHIP WHO VENTURED THITHER
DISAPPEARED IN MORSELS A CITY OF THIEVES A HIDEOUS WART ON THE FACE OF
PARIS A SEWER FROM WHICH ESCAPED EVERY MORNING AND WHITHER RETURNED
EVERY NIGHT TO CROUCH THAT STREAM OF VICES OF MENDICANCY AND
VAGABONDAGE WHICH ALWAYS OVERFLOWS IN THE STREETS OF CAPITALS A
MONSTROUS HIVE TO WHICH RETURNED AT NIGHTFALL WITH THEIR BOOTY ALL
THE DRONES OF THE SOCIAL ORDER A LYING HOSPITAL WHERE THE BOHEMIAN THE
DISFROCKED MONK THE RUINED SCHOLAR THE NE'ER DO WELLS OF ALL NATIONS
SPANIARDS ITALIANS GERMANS OF ALL RELIGIONS JEWS CHRISTIANS
MAHOMETANS IDOLATERS COVERED WITH PAINTED SORES BEGGARS BY DAY WERE
TRANSFORMED BY NIGHT INTO BRIGANDS AN IMMENSE DRESSING ROOM IN A WORD
WHERE AT THAT EPOCH THE ACTORS OF THAT ETERNAL COMEDY WHICH THEFT
PROSTITUTION AND MURDER PLAY UPON THE PAVEMENTS OF PARIS DRESSED AND
UNDRESSED
IT WAS A VAST PLACE IRREGULAR AND BADLY PAVED LIKE ALL THE SQUARES OF
PARIS AT THAT DATE
FIRES AROUND WHICH SWARMED STRANGE GROUPS BLAZED
HERE AND THERE
EVERY ONE WAS GOING COMING AND SHOUTING
SHRILL
LAUGHTER WAS TO BE HEARD THE WAILING OF CHILDREN THE VOICES OF
WOMEN
THE HANDS AND HEADS OF THIS THRONG BLACK AGAINST THE LUMINOUS
BACKGROUND OUTLINED AGAINST IT A THOUSAND ECCENTRIC GESTURES
AT TIMES
UPON THE GROUND WHERE TREMBLED THE LIGHT OF THE FIRES MINGLED WITH
LARGE INDEFINITE SHADOWS ONE COULD BEHOLD A DOG PASSING WHICH
RESEMBLED A MAN A MAN WHO RESEMBLED A DOG
THE LIMITS OF RACES AND
SPECIES SEEMED EFFACED IN THIS CITY AS IN A PANDEMONIUM
MEN WOMEN
BEASTS AGE SEX HEALTH MALADIES ALL SEEMED TO BE IN COMMON AMONG
THESE PEOPLE ALL WENT TOGETHER THEY MINGLED CONFOUNDED SUPERPOSED
EACH ONE THERE PARTICIPATED IN ALL
THE POOR AND FLICKERING FLAMES OF THE FIRE PERMITTED GRINGOIRE TO
DISTINGUISH AMID HIS TROUBLE ALL AROUND THE IMMENSE PLACE A HIDEOUS
FRAME OF ANCIENT HOUSES WHOSE WORMEATEN SHRIVELLED STUNTED FAADES
EACH PIERCED WITH ONE OR TWO LIGHTED ATTIC WINDOWS SEEMED TO HIM IN
THE DARKNESS LIKE ENORMOUS HEADS OF OLD WOMEN RANGED IN A CIRCLE
MONSTROUS AND CRABBED WINKING AS THEY LOOKED ON AT THE WITCHES'
SABBATH
IT WAS LIKE A NEW WORLD UNKNOWN UNHEARD OF MISSHAPEN CREEPING
SWARMING FANTASTIC
GRINGOIRE MORE AND MORE TERRIFIED CLUTCHED BY THE THREE BEGGARS AS BY
THREE PAIRS OF TONGS DAZED BY A THRONG OF OTHER FACES WHICH FROTHED AND
YELPED AROUND HIM UNHAPPY GRINGOIRE ENDEAVORED TO SUMMON HIS PRESENCE
OF MIND IN ORDER TO RECALL WHETHER IT WAS A SATURDAY
BUT HIS EFFORTS
WERE VAIN THE THREAD OF HIS MEMORY AND OF HIS THOUGHT WAS BROKEN AND
DOUBTING EVERYTHING WAVERING BETWEEN WHAT HE SAW AND WHAT HE FELT HE
PUT TO HIMSELF THIS UNANSWERABLE QUESTION
IF I EXIST DOES THIS EXIST IF THIS EXISTS DO I EXIST
AT THAT MOMENT A DISTINCT CRY AROSE IN THE BUZZING THRONG WHICH
SURROUNDED HIM LET'S TAKE HIM TO THE KING LET'S TAKE HIM TO THE
KING
HOLY VIRGIN MURMURED GRINGOIRE THE KING HERE MUST BE A RAM
TO THE KING TO THE KING REPEATED ALL VOICES
THEY DRAGGED HIM OFF
EACH VIED WITH THE OTHER IN LAYING HIS CLAWS UPON
HIM
BUT THE THREE BEGGARS DID NOT LOOSE THEIR HOLD AND TORE HIM FROM
THE REST HOWLING HE BELONGS TO US
THE POET'S ALREADY SICKLY DOUBLET YIELDED ITS LAST SIGH IN THIS
STRUGGLE
WHILE TRAVERSING THE HORRIBLE PLACE HIS VERTIGO VANISHED
AFTER TAKING
A FEW STEPS THE SENTIMENT OF REALITY RETURNED TO HIM
HE BEGAN TO
BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE PLACE
AT THE FIRST MOMENT
THERE HAD ARISEN FROM HIS POET'S HEAD OR SIMPLY AND PROSAICALLY
FROM HIS EMPTY STOMACH A MIST A VAPOR SO TO SPEAK WHICH SPREADING
BETWEEN OBJECTS AND HIMSELF PERMITTED HIM TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THEM
ONLY IN THE INCOHERENT FOG OF NIGHTMARE IN THOSE SHADOWS OF DREAMS
WHICH DISTORT EVERY OUTLINE AGGLOMERATING OBJECTS INTO UNWIELDY GROUPS
DILATING THINGS INTO CHIMERAS AND MEN INTO PHANTOMS
LITTLE BY LITTLE
THIS HALLUCINATION WAS SUCCEEDED BY A LESS BEWILDERED AND EXAGGERATING
VIEW
REALITY MADE ITS WAY TO THE LIGHT AROUND HIM STRUCK HIS EYES
STRUCK HIS FEET AND DEMOLISHED BIT BY BIT ALL THAT FRIGHTFUL POETRY
WITH WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE SURROUNDED
HE WAS
FORCED TO PERCEIVE THAT HE WAS NOT WALKING IN THE STYX BUT IN MUD THAT
HE WAS ELBOWED NOT BY DEMONS BUT BY THIEVES THAT IT WAS NOT HIS SOUL
WHICH WAS IN QUESTION BUT HIS LIFE SINCE HE LACKED THAT PRECIOUS
CONCILIATOR WHICH PLACES ITSELF SO EFFECTUALLY BETWEEN THE BANDIT AND
THE HONEST MAN A PURSE
IN SHORT ON EXAMINING THE ORGY MORE CLOSELY
AND WITH MORE COOLNESS HE FELL FROM THE WITCHES' SABBATH TO THE
DRAM SHOP
THE COUR DES MIRACLES WAS IN FACT MERELY A DRAM SHOP BUT A BRIGAND'S
DRAM SHOP REDDENED QUITE AS MUCH WITH BLOOD AS WITH WINE
THE SPECTACLE WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIS EYES WHEN HIS RAGGED ESCORT
FINALLY DEPOSITED HIM AT THE END OF HIS TRIP WAS NOT FITTED TO BEAR HIM
BACK TO POETRY EVEN TO THE POETRY OF HELL
IT WAS MORE THAN EVER THE
PROSAIC AND BRUTAL REALITY OF THE TAVERN
WERE WE NOT IN THE FIFTEENTH
CENTURY WE WOULD SAY THAT GRINGOIRE HAD DESCENDED FROM MICHAEL ANGELO
TO CALLOT
AROUND A GREAT FIRE WHICH BURNED ON A LARGE CIRCULAR FLAGSTONE THE
FLAMES OF WHICH HAD HEATED RED HOT THE LEGS OF A TRIPOD WHICH WAS
EMPTY FOR THE MOMENT SOME WORMEATEN TABLES WERE PLACED HERE AND THERE
HAPHAZARD NO LACKEY OF A GEOMETRICAL TURN HAVING DEIGNED TO ADJUST
THEIR PARALLELISM OR TO SEE TO IT THAT THEY DID NOT MAKE TOO UNUSUAL
ANGLES
UPON THESE TABLES GLEAMED SEVERAL DRIPPING POTS OF WINE AND
BEER AND ROUND THESE POTS WERE GROUPED MANY BACCHIC VISAGES PURPLE
WITH THE FIRE AND THE WINE
THERE WAS A MAN WITH A HUGE BELLY AND A
JOVIAL FACE NOISILY KISSING A WOMAN OF THE TOWN THICKSET AND BRAWNY
THERE WAS A SORT OF SHAM SOLDIER A NAQUOIS AS THE SLANG EXPRESSION
RUNS WHO WAS WHISTLING AS HE UNDID THE BANDAGES FROM HIS FICTITIOUS
WOUND AND REMOVING THE NUMBNESS FROM HIS SOUND AND VIGOROUS KNEE WHICH
HAD BEEN SWATHED SINCE MORNING IN A THOUSAND LIGATURES
ON THE OTHER
HAND THERE WAS A WRETCHED FELLOW PREPARING WITH CELANDINE AND BEEF'S
BLOOD HIS LEG OF GOD FOR THE NEXT DAY
TWO TABLES FURTHER ON A
PALMER WITH HIS PILGRIM'S COSTUME COMPLETE WAS PRACTISING THE LAMENT
OF THE HOLY QUEEN NOT FORGETTING THE DRONE AND THE NASAL DRAWL
FURTHER
ON A YOUNG SCAMP WAS TAKING A LESSON IN EPILEPSY FROM AN OLD PRETENDER
WHO WAS INSTRUCTING HIM IN THE ART OF FOAMING AT THE MOUTH BY CHEWING A
MORSEL OF SOAP
BESIDE HIM A MAN WITH THE DROPSY WAS GETTING RID OF HIS
SWELLING AND MAKING FOUR OR FIVE FEMALE THIEVES WHO WERE DISPUTING
AT THE SAME TABLE OVER A CHILD WHO HAD BEEN STOLEN THAT EVENING HOLD
THEIR NOSES
ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH TWO CENTURIES LATER SEEMED SO
RIDICULOUS TO THE COURT AS SAUVAL SAYS THAT THEY SERVED AS A PASTIME
TO THE KING AND AS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ROYAL BALLET OF NIGHT
DIVIDED INTO FOUR PARTS AND DANCED ON THE THEATRE OF THE PETIT BOURBON
NEVER ADDS AN EYE WITNESS OF 1653 HAVE THE SUDDEN METAMORPHOSES OF
THE COURT OF MIRACLES BEEN MORE HAPPILY PRESENTED
BENSERADE PREPARED US
FOR IT BY SOME VERY GALLANT VERSES
LOUD LAUGHTER EVERYWHERE AND OBSCENE SONGS
EACH ONE HELD HIS OWN
COURSE CARPING AND SWEARING WITHOUT LISTENING TO HIS NEIGHBOR
POTS
CLINKED AND QUARRELS SPRANG UP AT THE SHOCK OF THE POTS AND THE BROKEN
POTS MADE RENTS IN THE RAGS
A BIG DOG SEATED ON HIS TAIL GAZED AT THE FIRE
SOME CHILDREN WERE
MINGLED IN THIS ORGY
THE STOLEN CHILD WEPT AND CRIED
ANOTHER A BIG
BOY FOUR YEARS OF AGE SEATED WITH LEGS DANGLING UPON A BENCH THAT WAS
TOO HIGH FOR HIM BEFORE A TABLE THAT REACHED TO HIS CHIN AND UTTERING
NOT A WORD
A THIRD GRAVELY SPREADING OUT UPON THE TABLE WITH HIS
FINGER THE MELTED TALLOW WHICH DRIPPED FROM A CANDLE
LAST OF ALL A
LITTLE FELLOW CROUCHING IN THE MUD ALMOST LOST IN A CAULDRON WHICH
HE WAS SCRAPING WITH A TILE AND FROM WHICH HE WAS EVOKING A SOUND THAT
WOULD HAVE MADE STRADIVARIUS SWOON
NEAR THE FIRE WAS A HOGSHEAD AND ON THE HOGSHEAD A BEGGAR
THIS WAS THE
KING ON HIS THRONE
THE THREE WHO HAD GRINGOIRE IN THEIR CLUTCHES LED HIM IN FRONT OF THIS
HOGSHEAD AND THE ENTIRE BACCHANAL ROUT FELL SILENT FOR A MOMENT WITH
THE EXCEPTION OF THE CAULDRON INHABITED BY THE CHILD
GRINGOIRE DARED NEITHER BREATHE NOR RAISE HIS EYES
HOMBRE QUITA TU SOMBRERO SAID ONE OF THE THREE KNAVES IN WHOSE
GRASP HE WAS AND BEFORE HE HAD COMPREHENDED THE MEANING THE OTHER HAD
SNATCHED HIS HAT A WRETCHED HEADGEAR IT IS TRUE BUT STILL GOOD ON A
SUNNY DAY OR WHEN THERE WAS BUT LITTLE RAIN
GRINGOIRE SIGHED
MEANWHILE THE KING ADDRESSED HIM FROM THE SUMMIT OF HIS CASK
WHO IS THIS ROGUE
GRINGOIRE SHUDDERED
THAT VOICE ALTHOUGH ACCENTUATED BY MENACE
RECALLED TO HIM ANOTHER VOICE WHICH THAT VERY MORNING HAD DEALT THE
DEATHBLOW TO HIS MYSTERY BY DRAWLING NASALLY IN THE MIDST OF THE
AUDIENCE CHARITY PLEASE HE RAISED HIS HEAD
IT WAS INDEED CLOPIN
TROUILLEFOU
CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU ARRAYED IN HIS ROYAL INSIGNIA WORE NEITHER ONE RAG
MORE NOR ONE RAG LESS
THE SORE UPON HIS ARM HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED
HE HELD IN HIS HAND ONE OF THOSE WHIPS MADE OF THONGS OF WHITE LEATHER
WHICH POLICE SERGEANTS THEN USED TO REPRESS THE CROWD AND WHICH WERE
CALLED BOULLAYES
ON HIS HEAD HE WORE A SORT OF HEADGEAR BOUND ROUND
AND CLOSED AT THE TOP
BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT WHETHER IT WAS
A CHILD'S CAP OR A KING'S CROWN THE TWO THINGS BORE SO STRONG A
RESEMBLANCE TO EACH OTHER
MEANWHILE GRINGOIRE WITHOUT KNOWING WHY HAD REGAINED SOME HOPE ON
RECOGNIZING IN THE KING OF THE COUR DES MIRACLES HIS ACCURSED MENDICANT
OF THE GRAND HALL
MASTER STAMMERED HE MONSEIGNEUR SIRE HOW OUGHT I TO ADDRESS
YOU HE SAID AT LENGTH HAVING REACHED THE CULMINATING POINT OF HIS
CRESCENDO AND KNOWING NEITHER HOW TO MOUNT HIGHER NOR TO DESCEND
AGAIN
MONSEIGNEUR HIS MAJESTY OR COMRADE CALL ME WHAT YOU PLEASE
BUT MAKE
HASTE
WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY IN YOUR OWN DEFENCE
IN YOUR OWN DEFENCE THOUGHT GRINGOIRE THAT DISPLEASES ME HE
RESUMED STUTTERING I AM HE WHO THIS MORNING

GENTLEMEN AND HONEST BOURGEOIS AS YOU TREAT OUR PEOPLE IN YOUR ABODE
SO WE TREAT YOU IN OURS THE LAW WHICH YOU APPLY TO VAGABONDS VAGABONDS

MORTAR YONDER IN STONE WHICH WE STOLE FROM SAINT PIERRE AUX BOEUFS

THE HARANGUE WAS FORMIDABLE
WELL SAID UPON MY SOUL CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU PREACHES LIKE THE HOLY
FATHER THE POPE EXCLAIMED THE EMPEROR OF GALILEE SMASHING HIS POT IN
ORDER TO PROP UP HIS TABLE
MESSEIGNEURS EMPERORS AND KINGS SAID GRINGOIRE COOLLY FOR I KNOW
NOT HOW FIRMNESS HAD RETURNED TO HIM AND HE SPOKE WITH RESOLUTION
DON'T THINK OF SUCH A THING MY NAME IS PIERRE GRINGOIRE
I AM THE
POET WHOSE MORALITY WAS PRESENTED THIS MORNING IN THE GRAND HALL OF THE
COURTS
AH SO IT WAS YOU MASTER SAID CLOPIN
I WAS THERE XTE DIEU
WELL COMRADE IS THAT ANY REASON BECAUSE YOU BORED US TO DEATH THIS
MORNING THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE HUNG THIS EVENING
I SHALL FIND DIFFICULTY IN GETTING OUT OF IT SAID GRINGOIRE TO
HIMSELF
NEVERTHELESS HE MADE ONE MORE EFFORT I DON'T SEE WHY POETS
ARE NOT CLASSED WITH VAGABONDS SAID HE
VAGABOND AESOPUS CERTAINLY
WAS HOMERUS WAS A BEGGAR MERCURIUS WAS A THIEF
CLOPIN INTERRUPTED HIM I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO BLARNEY US
WITH YOUR JARGON
ZOUNDS LET YOURSELF BE HUNG AND DON'T KICK UP SUCH A
ROW OVER IT
PARDON ME MONSEIGNEUR THE KING OF THUNES REPLIED GRINGOIRE
DISPUTING THE GROUND FOOT BY FOOT
IT IS WORTH TROUBLE ONE
MOMENT LISTEN TO ME YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CONDEMN ME WITHOUT HAVING
HEARD ME
HIS UNLUCKY VOICE WAS IN FACT DROWNED IN THE UPROAR WHICH ROSE AROUND
HIM
THE LITTLE BOY SCRAPED AWAY AT HIS CAULDRON WITH MORE SPIRIT THAN
EVER AND TO CROWN ALL AN OLD WOMAN HAD JUST PLACED ON THE TRIPOD A
FRYING PAN OF GREASE WHICH HISSED AWAY ON THE FIRE WITH A NOISE SIMILAR
TO THE CRY OF A TROOP OF CHILDREN IN PURSUIT OF A MASKER
IN THE MEANTIME CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU APPEARED TO HOLD A MOMENTARY
CONFERENCE WITH THE DUKE OF EGYPT AND THE EMPEROR OF GALILEE WHO
WAS COMPLETELY DRUNK
THEN HE SHOUTED SHRILLY SILENCE AND AS THE
CAULDRON AND THE FRYING PAN DID NOT HEED HIM AND CONTINUED THEIR DUET
HE JUMPED DOWN FROM HIS HOGSHEAD GAVE A KICK TO THE BOILER WHICH
ROLLED TEN PACES AWAY BEARING THE CHILD WITH IT A KICK TO THE
FRYING PAN WHICH UPSET IN THE FIRE WITH ALL ITS GREASE AND GRAVELY
REMOUNTED HIS THRONE WITHOUT TROUBLING HIMSELF ABOUT THE STIFLED
TEARS OF THE CHILD OR THE GRUMBLING OF THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE SUPPER WAS
WASTING AWAY IN A FINE WHITE FLAME
TROUILLEFOU MADE A SIGN AND THE DUKE THE EMPEROR AND THE PASSED
MASTERS OF PICKPOCKETS AND THE ISOLATED ROBBERS CAME AND RANGED
THEMSELVES AROUND HIM IN A HORSESHOE OF WHICH GRINGOIRE STILL ROUGHLY
HELD BY THE BODY FORMED THE CENTRE
IT WAS A SEMICIRCLE OF RAGS
TATTERS TINSEL PITCHFORKS AXES LEGS STAGGERING WITH INTOXICATION
HUGE BARE ARMS FACES SORDID DULL AND STUPID
IN THE MIDST OF THIS
ROUND TABLE OF BEGGARY CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU AS THE DOGE OF THIS SENATE
AS THE KING OF THIS PEERAGE AS THE POPE OF THIS CONCLAVE DOMINATED
FIRST BY VIRTUE OF THE HEIGHT OF HIS HOGSHEAD AND NEXT BY VIRTUE OF
AN INDESCRIBABLE HAUGHTY FIERCE AND FORMIDABLE AIR WHICH CAUSED HIS
EYES TO FLASH AND CORRECTED IN HIS SAVAGE PROFILE THE BESTIAL TYPE OF
THE RACE OF VAGABONDS
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HIM A BOAR AMID A HERD
OF SWINE
LISTEN SAID HE TO GRINGOIRE FONDLING HIS MISSHAPEN CHIN WITH HIS
HORNY HAND I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULD NOT BE HUNG
IT IS TRUE THAT
IT APPEARS TO BE REPUGNANT TO YOU AND IT IS VERY NATURAL FOR YOU
BOURGEOIS ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO IT
YOU FORM FOR YOURSELVES A GREAT IDEA
OF THE THING
AFTER ALL WE DON'T WISH YOU ANY HARM
HERE IS A MEANS
OF EXTRICATING YOURSELF FROM YOUR PREDICAMENT FOR THE MOMENT
WILL YOU
BECOME ONE OF US
THE READER CAN JUDGE OF THE EFFECT WHICH THIS PROPOSITION PRODUCED UPON
GRINGOIRE WHO BEHELD LIFE SLIPPING AWAY FROM HIM AND WHO WAS BEGINNING
TO LOSE HIS HOLD UPON IT
HE CLUTCHED AT IT AGAIN WITH ENERGY
CERTAINLY I WILL AND RIGHT HEARTILY SAID HE
DO YOU CONSENT RESUMED CLOPIN TO ENROLL YOURSELF AMONG THE PEOPLE

MORE CEREMONY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE GOOD CITY OF PARIS ON A HANDSOME
STONE GIBBET AND BY HONEST MEN
THAT IS A CONSOLATION
JUST SO RESPONDED GRINGOIRE
THERE ARE OTHER ADVANTAGES
IN YOUR QUALITY OF A HIGH TONED SHARPER
YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY THE TAXES ON MUD OR THE POOR OR LANTERNS TO
WHICH THE BOURGEOIS OF PARIS ARE SUBJECT
SO BE IT SAID THE POET
I AGREE

THE KING OF THUNES SCOWLED
WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR MY FRIEND WHAT HUNGARIAN JEW PATTER ARE YOU
JABBERING AT US I DON'T KNOW HEBREW
ONE ISN'T A JEW BECAUSE ONE IS
A BANDIT
I DON'T EVEN STEAL ANY LONGER
I'M ABOVE THAT I KILL
CUT THROAT YES CUTPURSE NO
GRINGOIRE TRIED TO SLIP IN SOME EXCUSE BETWEEN THESE CURT WORDS WHICH
WRATH RENDERED MORE AND MORE JERKY
I ASK YOUR PARDON MONSEIGNEUR
IT IS NOT HEBREW 'TIS LATIN
I TELL YOU RESUMED CLOPIN ANGRILY THAT I'M NOT A JEW AND THAT I'LL
HAVE YOU HUNG BELLY OF THE SYNAGOGUE LIKE THAT LITTLE SHOPKEEPER OF
JUDEA WHO IS BY YOUR SIDE AND WHOM I ENTERTAIN STRONG HOPES OF SEEING
NAILED TO A COUNTER ONE OF THESE DAYS LIKE THE COUNTERFEIT COIN THAT HE
IS
SO SAYING HE POINTED HIS FINGER AT THE LITTLE BEARDED HUNGARIAN JEW
WHO HAD ACCOSTED GRINGOIRE WITH HIS FACITOTE CARITATEM AND WHO
UNDERSTANDING NO OTHER LANGUAGE BEHELD WITH SURPRISE THE KING OF
THUNES'S ILL HUMOR OVERFLOW UPON HIM
AT LENGTH MONSIEUR CLOPIN CALMED DOWN
SO YOU WILL BE A VAGABOND YOU KNAVE HE SAID TO OUR POET
OF COURSE REPLIED THE POET
WILLING IS NOT ALL SAID THE SURLY CLOPIN GOOD WILL DOESN'T PUT ONE
ONION THE MORE INTO THE SOUP AND 'TIS GOOD FOR NOTHING EXCEPT TO GO
TO PARADISE WITH NOW PARADISE AND THE THIEVES' BAND ARE TWO DIFFERENT
THINGS
IN ORDER TO BE RECEIVED AMONG THE THIEVES YOU MUST PROVE THAT
YOU ARE GOOD FOR SOMETHING AND FOR THAT PURPOSE YOU MUST SEARCH THE
MANIKIN
L'ARGOT
I'LL SEARCH ANYTHING YOU LIKE SAID GRINGOIRE
CLOPIN MADE A SIGN
SEVERAL THIEVES DETACHED THEMSELVES FROM THE CIRCLE
AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER
THEY BROUGHT TWO THICK POSTS TERMINATED
AT THEIR LOWER EXTREMITIES IN SPREADING TIMBER SUPPORTS WHICH MADE THEM
STAND READILY UPON THE GROUND TO THE UPPER EXTREMITY OF THE TWO POSTS
THEY FITTED A CROSS BEAM AND THE WHOLE CONSTITUTED A VERY PRETTY
PORTABLE GIBBET WHICH GRINGOIRE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF BEHOLDING RISE
BEFORE HIM IN A TWINKLING
NOTHING WAS LACKING NOT EVEN THE ROPE
WHICH SWUNG GRACEFULLY OVER THE CROSS BEAM
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO GRINGOIRE ASKED HIMSELF WITH SOME
UNEASINESS
A SOUND OF BELLS WHICH HE HEARD AT THAT MOMENT PUT AN
END TO HIS ANXIETY IT WAS A STUFFED MANIKIN WHICH THE VAGABONDS WERE
SUSPENDING BY THE NECK FROM THE ROPE A SORT OF SCARECROW DRESSED IN
RED AND SO HUNG WITH MULE BELLS AND LARGER BELLS THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE
TRICKED OUT THIRTY CASTILIAN MULES WITH THEM
THESE THOUSAND TINY BELLS
QUIVERED FOR SOME TIME WITH THE VIBRATION OF THE ROPE THEN GRADUALLY
DIED AWAY AND FINALLY BECAME SILENT WHEN THE MANIKIN HAD BEEN BROUGHT
INTO A STATE OF IMMOBILITY BY THAT LAW OF THE PENDULUM WHICH HAS
DETHRONED THE WATER CLOCK AND THE HOUR GLASS
THEN CLOPIN POINTING OUT
TO GRINGOIRE A RICKETY OLD STOOL PLACED BENEATH THE MANIKIN CLIMB UP
THERE
DEATH OF THE DEVIL OBJECTED GRINGOIRE I SHALL BREAK MY NECK
YOUR
STOOL LIMPS LIKE ONE OF MARTIAL'S DISTICHES IT HAS ONE HEXAMETER LEG
AND ONE PENTAMETER LEG
CLIMB REPEATED CLOPIN
GRINGOIRE MOUNTED THE STOOL AND SUCCEEDED NOT WITHOUT SOME
OSCILLATIONS OF HEAD AND ARMS IN REGAINING HIS CENTRE OF GRAVITY
NOW WENT ON THE KING OF THUNES TWIST YOUR RIGHT FOOT ROUND YOUR
LEFT LEG AND RISE ON THE TIP OF YOUR LEFT FOOT
MONSEIGNEUR SAID GRINGOIRE SO YOU ABSOLUTELY INSIST ON MY BREAKING
SOME ONE OF MY LIMBS
CLOPIN TOSSED HIS HEAD
HARK YE MY FRIEND YOU TALK TOO MUCH
HERE'S THE GIST OF THE MATTER
IN TWO WORDS YOU ARE TO RISE ON TIPTOE AS I TELL YOU IN THAT WAY YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO REACH THE POCKET OF THE MANIKIN YOU WILL RUMMAGE IT
YOU WILL PULL OUT THE PURSE THAT IS THERE AND IF YOU DO ALL THIS
WITHOUT OUR HEARING THE SOUND OF A BELL ALL IS WELL YOU SHALL BE A
VAGABOND
ALL WE SHALL THEN HAVE TO DO WILL BE TO THRASH YOU SOUNDLY
FOR THE SPACE OF A WEEK
VENTRE DIEU I WILL BE CAREFUL SAID GRINGOIRE
AND SUPPOSE I DO
MAKE THE BELLS SOUND
THEN YOU WILL BE HANGED
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL REPLIED GRINGOIRE
LISTEN ONCE MORE
YOU ARE TO SEARCH THE MANIKIN AND TAKE AWAY ITS
PURSE IF A SINGLE BELL STIRS DURING THE OPERATION YOU WILL BE HUNG
DO
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
GOOD SAID GRINGOIRE I UNDERSTAND THAT
AND THEN
IF YOU SUCCEED IN REMOVING THE PURSE WITHOUT OUR HEARING THE BELLS YOU
ARE A VAGABOND AND YOU WILL BE THRASHED FOR EIGHT CONSECUTIVE DAYS
YOU
UNDERSTAND NOW NO DOUBT
NO MONSEIGNEUR I NO LONGER UNDERSTAND
WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE TO ME
HANGED IN ONE CASE CUDGELLED IN THE OTHER
AND A VAGABOND RESUMED CLOPIN AND A VAGABOND IS THAT NOTHING IT
IS FOR YOUR INTEREST THAT WE SHOULD BEAT YOU IN ORDER TO HARDEN YOU TO
BLOWS
MANY THANKS REPLIED THE POET
COME MAKE HASTE SAID THE KING STAMPING UPON HIS CASK WHICH
RESOUNDED LIKE A HUGE DRUM SEARCH THE MANIKIN AND LET THERE BE AN END
TO THIS I WARN YOU FOR THE LAST TIME THAT IF I HEAR A SINGLE BELL YOU
WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF THE MANIKIN
THE BAND OF THIEVES APPLAUDED CLOPIN'S WORDS AND ARRANGED THEMSELVES
IN A CIRCLE ROUND THE GIBBET WITH A LAUGH SO PITILESS THAT GRINGOIRE
PERCEIVED THAT HE AMUSED THEM TOO MUCH NOT TO HAVE EVERYTHING TO FEAR
FROM THEM
NO HOPE WAS LEFT FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY UNLESS IT WERE THE
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING IN THE FORMIDABLE OPERATION WHICH WAS
IMPOSED UPON HIM HE DECIDED TO RISK IT BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT FIRST
HAVING ADDRESSED A FERVENT PRAYER TO THE MANIKIN HE WAS ABOUT TO
PLUNDER AND WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO MOVE TO PITY THAN THE
VAGABONDS
THESE MYRIAD BELLS WITH THEIR LITTLE COPPER TONGUES SEEMED
TO HIM LIKE THE MOUTHS OF SO MANY ASPS OPEN AND READY TO STING AND TO
HISS
OH HE SAID IN A VERY LOW VOICE IS IT POSSIBLE THAT MY LIFE DEPENDS
ON THE SLIGHTEST VIBRATION OF THE LEAST OF THESE BELLS OH HE ADDED
WITH CLASPED HANDS BELLS DO NOT RING HAND BELLS DO NOT CLANG
MULE BELLS DO NOT QUIVER
HE MADE ONE MORE ATTEMPT UPON TROUILLEFOU
AND IF THERE SHOULD COME A GUST OF WIND
YOU WILL BE HANGED REPLIED THE OTHER WITHOUT HESITATION
PERCEIVING THAT NO RESPITE NOR REPRIEVE NOR SUBTERFUGE WAS POSSIBLE
HE BRAVELY DECIDED UPON HIS COURSE OF ACTION HE WOUND HIS RIGHT FOOT
ROUND HIS LEFT LEG RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS LEFT FOOT AND STRETCHED OUT
HIS ARM BUT AT THE MOMENT WHEN HIS HAND TOUCHED THE MANIKIN HIS BODY
WHICH WAS NOW SUPPORTED UPON ONE LEG ONLY WAVERED ON THE STOOL WHICH
HAD BUT THREE HE MADE AN INVOLUNTARY EFFORT TO SUPPORT HIMSELF BY THE
MANIKIN LOST HIS BALANCE AND FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND DEAFENED
BY THE FATAL VIBRATION OF THE THOUSAND BELLS OF THE MANIKIN WHICH
YIELDING TO THE IMPULSE IMPARTED BY HIS HAND DESCRIBED FIRST A ROTARY
MOTION AND THEN SWAYED MAJESTICALLY BETWEEN THE TWO POSTS
MALEDICTION HE CRIED AS HE FELL AND REMAINED AS THOUGH DEAD WITH
HIS FACE TO THE EARTH
MEANWHILE HE HEARD THE DREADFUL PEAL ABOVE HIS HEAD THE DIABOLICAL
LAUGHTER OF THE VAGABONDS AND THE VOICE OF TROUILLEFOU SAYING
PICK ME UP THAT KNAVE AND HANG HIM WITHOUT CEREMONY HE ROSE
THEY
HAD ALREADY DETACHED THE MANIKIN TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM
THE THIEVES MADE HIM MOUNT THE STOOL CLOPIN CAME TO HIM PASSED THE
ROPE ABOUT HIS NECK AND TAPPING HIM ON THE SHOULDER
ADIEU MY FRIEND
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE NOW EVEN IF YOU DIGESTED WITH THE
POPE'S GUTS
THE WORD MERCY DIED AWAY UPON GRINGOIRE'S LIPS
HE CAST HIS EYES
ABOUT HIM BUT THERE WAS NO HOPE ALL WERE LAUGHING
BELLEVIGNE DE L'ETOILE SAID THE KING OF THUNES TO AN ENORMOUS
VAGABOND WHO STEPPED OUT FROM THE RANKS CLIMB UPON THE CROSS BEAM
BELLEVIGNE DE L'ETOILE NIMBLY MOUNTED THE TRANSVERSE BEAM AND IN
ANOTHER MINUTE GRINGOIRE ON RAISING HIS EYES BEHELD HIM WITH TERROR
SEATED UPON THE BEAM ABOVE HIS HEAD
NOW RESUMED CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU AS SOON AS I CLAP MY HANDS YOU
ANDRY THE RED WILL FLING THE STOOL TO THE GROUND WITH A BLOW OF YOUR
KNEE YOU FRANOIS CHANTE PRUNE WILL CLING TO THE FEET OF THE RASCAL
AND YOU BELLEVIGNE WILL FLING YOURSELF ON HIS SHOULDERS AND ALL THREE
AT ONCE DO YOU HEAR
GRINGOIRE SHUDDERED
ARE YOU READY SAID CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU TO THE THREE THIEVES WHO HELD
THEMSELVES IN READINESS TO FALL UPON GRINGOIRE
A MOMENT OF HORRIBLE
SUSPENSE ENSUED FOR THE POOR VICTIM DURING WHICH CLOPIN TRANQUILLY
THRUST INTO THE FIRE WITH THE TIP OF HIS FOOT SOME BITS OF VINE SHOOTS
WHICH THE FLAME HAD NOT CAUGHT
ARE YOU READY HE REPEATED AND OPENED
HIS HANDS TO CLAP
ONE SECOND MORE AND ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER
BUT HE PAUSED AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A SUDDEN THOUGHT
ONE MOMENT SAID HE I FORGOT IT IS OUR CUSTOM NOT TO HANG A MAN
WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER THERE IS ANY WOMAN WHO WANTS HIM
COMRADE
THIS IS YOUR LAST RESOURCE
YOU MUST WED EITHER A FEMALE VAGABOND OR THE
NOOSE
THIS LAW OF THE VAGABONDS SINGULAR AS IT MAY STRIKE THE READER REMAINS
TO DAY WRITTEN OUT AT LENGTH IN ANCIENT ENGLISH LEGISLATION
SEE
BURINGTON'S OBSERVATIONS
GRINGOIRE BREATHED AGAIN
THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THAT HE HAD
RETURNED TO LIFE WITHIN AN HOUR
SO HE DID NOT DARE TO TRUST TO IT TOO
IMPLICITLY
HOL CRIED CLOPIN MOUNTED ONCE MORE UPON HIS CASK HOL WOMEN
FEMALES IS THERE AMONG YOU FROM THE SORCERESS TO HER CAT A WENCH WHO
WANTS THIS RASCAL HOL COLETTE LA CHARONNE ELISABETH TROUVAIN SIMONE
JODOUYNE MARIE PIDEBOU THONNE LA LONGUE BRARDE FANOUEL
MICHELLE GENAILLE CLAUDE RONGE OREILLE MATHURINE GIROROU HOL
ISABEAU LA THIERRYE COME AND SEE A MAN FOR NOTHING WHO WANTS HIM
GRINGOIRE NO DOUBT WAS NOT VERY APPETIZING IN THIS MISERABLE
CONDITION
THE FEMALE VAGABONDS DID NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH AFFECTED BY THE
PROPOSITION
THE UNHAPPY WRETCH HEARD THEM ANSWER NO NO HANG HIM
THERE'LL BE THE MORE FUN FOR US ALL
NEVERTHELESS THREE EMERGED FROM THE THRONG AND CAME TO SMELL OF
HIM
THE FIRST WAS A BIG WENCH WITH A SQUARE FACE
SHE EXAMINED THE
PHILOSOPHER'S DEPLORABLE DOUBLET ATTENTIVELY
HIS GARMENT WAS WORN AND
MORE FULL OF HOLES THAN A STOVE FOR ROASTING CHESTNUTS
THE GIRL MADE A
WRY FACE
OLD RAG SHE MUTTERED AND ADDRESSING GRINGOIRE LET'S SEE
YOUR CLOAK I HAVE LOST IT REPLIED GRINGOIRE
YOUR HAT THEY TOOK
IT AWAY FROM ME YOUR SHOES THEY HAVE HARDLY ANY SOLES LEFT YOUR
PURSE ALAS STAMMERED GRINGOIRE I HAVE NOT EVEN A SOU LET
THEM HANG YOU THEN AND SAY 'THANK YOU RETORTED THE VAGABOND WENCH
TURNING HER BACK ON HIM
THE SECOND OLD BLACK WRINKLED HIDEOUS WITH AN UGLINESS CONSPICUOUS
EVEN IN THE COUR DES MIRACLES TROTTED ROUND GRINGOIRE
HE ALMOST
TREMBLED LEST SHE SHOULD WANT HIM
BUT SHE MUMBLED BETWEEN HER TEETH
HE'S TOO THIN AND WENT OFF
THE THIRD WAS A YOUNG GIRL QUITE FRESH AND NOT TOO UGLY
SAVE ME
SAID THE POOR FELLOW TO HER IN A LOW TONE
SHE GAZED AT HIM FOR A
MOMENT WITH AN AIR OF PITY THEN DROPPED HER EYES MADE A PLAIT IN HER
PETTICOAT AND REMAINED IN INDECISION
HE FOLLOWED ALL THESE MOVEMENTS
WITH HIS EYES IT WAS THE LAST GLEAM OF HOPE
NO SAID THE YOUNG GIRL
AT LENGTH NO GUILLAUME LONGUEJOUE WOULD BEAT ME SHE RETREATED INTO
THE CROWD
YOU ARE UNLUCKY COMRADE SAID CLOPIN
THEN RISING TO HIS FEET UPON HIS HOGSHEAD
NO ONE WANTS HIM HE
EXCLAIMED IMITATING THE ACCENT OF AN AUCTIONEER TO THE GREAT DELIGHT
OF ALL NO ONE WANTS HIM ONCE TWICE THREE TIMES AND TURNING
TOWARDS THE GIBBET WITH A SIGN OF HIS HAND GONE
BELLEVIGNE DE L'ETOILE ANDRY THE RED FRANOIS CHANTE PRUNE STEPPED UP
TO GRINGOIRE
AT THAT MOMENT A CRY AROSE AMONG THE THIEVES LA ESMERALDA LA
ESMERALDA
GRINGOIRE SHUDDERED AND TURNED TOWARDS THE SIDE WHENCE THE CLAMOR
PROCEEDED
THE CROWD OPENED AND GAVE PASSAGE TO A PURE AND DAZZLING FORM
IT WAS THE GYPSY
LA ESMERALDA SAID GRINGOIRE STUPEFIED IN THE MIDST OF HIS EMOTIONS
BY THE ABRUPT MANNER IN WHICH THAT MAGIC WORD KNOTTED TOGETHER ALL HIS
REMINISCENCES OF THE DAY
THIS RARE CREATURE SEEMED EVEN IN THE COUR DES MIRACLES TO EXERCISE
HER SWAY OF CHARM AND BEAUTY
THE VAGABONDS MALE AND FEMALE RANGED
THEMSELVES GENTLY ALONG HER PATH AND THEIR BRUTAL FACES BEAMED BENEATH
HER GLANCE
SHE APPROACHED THE VICTIM WITH HER LIGHT STEP
HER PRETTY DJALI FOLLOWED
HER
GRINGOIRE WAS MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE
SHE EXAMINED HIM FOR A MOMENT
IN SILENCE
YOU ARE GOING TO HANG THIS MAN SHE SAID GRAVELY TO CLOPIN
YES SISTER REPLIED THE KING OF THUNES UNLESS YOU WILL TAKE HIM FOR
YOUR HUSBAND
SHE MADE HER PRETTY LITTLE POUT WITH HER UNDER LIP
I'LL TAKE HIM
SAID SHE
GRINGOIRE FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT HE HAD BEEN IN A DREAM EVER SINCE
MORNING AND THAT THIS WAS THE CONTINUATION OF IT
THE CHANGE WAS IN FACT VIOLENT THOUGH A GRATIFYING ONE
THEY UNDID
THE NOOSE AND MADE THE POET STEP DOWN FROM THE STOOL
HIS EMOTION WAS
SO LIVELY THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN
THE DUKE OF EGYPT BROUGHT AN EARTHENWARE CROCK WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD
THE GYPSY OFFERED IT TO GRINGOIRE FLING IT ON THE GROUND SAID SHE
THE CROCK BROKE INTO FOUR PIECES
BROTHER THEN SAID THE DUKE OF EGYPT LAYING HIS HANDS UPON THEIR
FOREHEADS SHE IS YOUR WIFE SISTER HE IS YOUR HUSBAND FOR FOUR YEARS
GO
CHAPTER VII
A BRIDAL NIGHT
A FEW MOMENTS LATER OUR POET FOUND HIMSELF IN A TINY ARCHED CHAMBER
VERY COSY VERY WARM SEATED AT A TABLE WHICH APPEARED TO ASK NOTHING
BETTER THAN TO MAKE SOME LOANS FROM A LARDER HANGING NEAR BY HAVING
A GOOD BED IN PROSPECT AND ALONE WITH A PRETTY GIRL
THE ADVENTURE
SMACKED OF ENCHANTMENT
HE BEGAN SERIOUSLY TO TAKE HIMSELF FOR A
PERSONAGE IN A FAIRY TALE HE CAST HIS EYES ABOUT HIM FROM TIME TO
TIME TO TIME AS THOUGH TO SEE IF THE CHARIOT OF FIRE HARNESSED TO
TWO WINGED CHIMERAS WHICH ALONE COULD HAVE SO RAPIDLY TRANSPORTED HIM
FROM TARTARUS TO PARADISE WERE STILL THERE
AT TIMES ALSO HE FIXED
HIS EYES OBSTINATELY UPON THE HOLES IN HIS DOUBLET IN ORDER TO CLING
TO REALITY AND NOT LOSE THE GROUND FROM UNDER HIS FEET COMPLETELY
HIS
REASON TOSSED ABOUT IN IMAGINARY SPACE NOW HUNG ONLY BY THIS THREAD
THE YOUNG GIRL DID NOT APPEAR TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM SHE WENT AND
CAME DISPLACED A STOOL TALKED TO HER GOAT AND INDULGED IN A POUT
NOW AND THEN
AT LAST SHE CAME AND SEATED HERSELF NEAR THE TABLE AND
GRINGOIRE WAS ABLE TO SCRUTINIZE HER AT HIS EASE
YOU HAVE BEEN A CHILD READER AND YOU WOULD PERHAPS BE VERY HAPPY TO
BE ONE STILL
IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE NOT MORE THAN ONCE AND
FOR MY PART I HAVE PASSED WHOLE DAYS THE BEST EMPLOYED OF MY LIFE AT
IT FOLLOWED FROM THICKET TO THICKET BY THE SIDE OF RUNNING WATER ON A
SUNNY DAY A BEAUTIFUL GREEN OR BLUE DRAGON FLY BREAKING ITS FLIGHT IN
ABRUPT ANGLES AND KISSING THE TIPS OF ALL THE BRANCHES
YOU RECOLLECT
WITH WHAT AMOROUS CURIOSITY YOUR THOUGHT AND YOUR GAZE WERE RIVETED
UPON THIS LITTLE WHIRLWIND HISSING AND HUMMING WITH WINGS OF PURPLE AND
AZURE IN THE MIDST OF WHICH FLOATED AN IMPERCEPTIBLE BODY VEILED BY
THE VERY RAPIDITY OF ITS MOVEMENT
THE AERIAL BEING WHICH WAS DIMLY
OUTLINED AMID THIS QUIVERING OF WINGS APPEARED TO YOU CHIMERICAL
IMAGINARY IMPOSSIBLE TO TOUCH IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE
BUT WHEN AT LENGTH
THE DRAGON FLY ALIGHTED ON THE TIP OF A REED AND HOLDING YOUR BREATH
THE WHILE YOU WERE ABLE TO EXAMINE THE LONG GAUZE WINGS THE LONG
ENAMEL ROBE THE TWO GLOBES OF CRYSTAL WHAT ASTONISHMENT YOU FELT AND
WHAT FEAR LEST YOU SHOULD AGAIN BEHOLD THE FORM DISAPPEAR INTO A SHADE
AND THE CREATURE INTO A CHIMERA RECALL THESE IMPRESSIONS AND YOU WILL
READILY APPRECIATE WHAT GRINGOIRE FELT ON CONTEMPLATING BENEATH HER
VISIBLE AND PALPABLE FORM THAT ESMERALDA OF WHOM UP TO THAT TIME
HE HAD ONLY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE AMIDST A WHIRLWIND OF DANCE SONG AND
TUMULT
SINKING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO HIS REVERY SO THIS HE SAID TO
HIMSELF FOLLOWING HER VAGUELY WITH HIS EYES IS LA ESMERALDA A
CELESTIAL CREATURE A STREET DANCER SO MUCH AND SO LITTLE 'TWAS SHE
WHO DEALT THE DEATH BLOW TO MY MYSTERY THIS MORNING 'TIS SHE WHO SAVES
MY LIFE THIS EVENING MY EVIL GENIUS MY GOOD ANGEL A PRETTY WOMAN
ON MY WORD AND WHO MUST NEEDS LOVE ME MADLY TO HAVE TAKEN ME IN THAT
FASHION
BY THE WAY SAID HE RISING SUDDENLY WITH THAT SENTIMENT
OF THE TRUE WHICH FORMED THE FOUNDATION OF HIS CHARACTER AND HIS
PHILOSOPHY I DON'T KNOW VERY WELL HOW IT HAPPENS BUT I AM HER
HUSBAND
WITH THIS IDEA IN HIS HEAD AND IN HIS EYES HE STEPPED UP TO THE YOUNG
GIRL IN A MANNER SO MILITARY AND SO GALLANT THAT SHE DREW BACK
WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME SAID SHE
CAN YOU ASK ME ADORABLE ESMERALDA REPLIED GRINGOIRE WITH SO
PASSIONATE AN ACCENT THAT HE WAS HIMSELF ASTONISHED AT IT ON HEARING
HIMSELF SPEAK
THE GYPSY OPENED HER GREAT EYES
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
WHAT RESUMED GRINGOIRE GROWING WARMER AND WARMER AND SUPPOSING
THAT AFTER ALL HE HAD TO DEAL MERELY WITH A VIRTUE OF THE COUR DES
MIRACLES AM I NOT THINE SWEET FRIEND ART THOU NOT MINE
AND QUITE INGENUOUSLY HE CLASPED HER WAIST
THE GYPSY'S CORSAGE SLIPPED THROUGH HIS HANDS LIKE THE SKIN OF AN EEL
SHE BOUNDED FROM ONE END OF THE TINY ROOM TO THE OTHER STOOPED DOWN
AND RAISED HERSELF AGAIN WITH A LITTLE PONIARD IN HER HAND BEFORE
GRINGOIRE HAD EVEN HAD TIME TO SEE WHENCE THE PONIARD CAME PROUD AND
ANGRY WITH SWELLING LIPS AND INFLATED NOSTRILS HER CHEEKS AS RED AS AN
API APPLE AND HER EYES DARTING LIGHTNINGS
AT THE SAME TIME THE WHITE
GOAT PLACED ITSELF IN FRONT OF HER AND PRESENTED TO GRINGOIRE A HOSTILE
FRONT BRISTLING WITH TWO PRETTY HORNS GILDED AND VERY SHARP
ALL THIS
TOOK PLACE IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
A SMALL DESSERT APPLE BRIGHT RED ON ONE SIDE AND
GREENISH WHITE ON THE OTHER
THE DRAGON FLY HAD TURNED INTO A WASP AND ASKED NOTHING BETTER THAN TO
STING
OUR PHILOSOPHER WAS SPEECHLESS AND TURNED HIS ASTONISHED EYES FROM THE
GOAT TO THE YOUNG GIRL
HOLY VIRGIN HE SAID AT LAST WHEN SURPRISE
PERMITTED HIM TO SPEAK HERE ARE TWO HEARTY DAMES
THE GYPSY BROKE THE SILENCE ON HER SIDE
YOU MUST BE A VERY BOLD KNAVE
PARDON MADEMOISELLE SAID GRINGOIRE WITH A SMILE
BUT WHY DID YOU
TAKE ME FOR YOUR HUSBAND
SHOULD I HAVE ALLOWED YOU TO BE HANGED
SO SAID THE POET SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN HIS AMOROUS HOPES
YOU
HAD NO OTHER IDEA IN MARRYING ME THAN TO SAVE ME FROM THE GIBBET
AND WHAT OTHER IDEA DID YOU SUPPOSE THAT I HAD
GRINGOIRE BIT HIS LIPS
COME SAID HE I AM NOT YET SO TRIUMPHANT IN
CUPIDO AS I THOUGHT
BUT THEN WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF BREAKING THAT POOR
JUG
MEANWHILE ESMERALDA'S DAGGER AND THE GOAT'S HORNS WERE STILL UPON THE
DEFENSIVE
MADEMOISELLE ESMERALDA SAID THE POET LET US COME TO TERMS
I AM
NOT A CLERK OF THE COURT AND I SHALL NOT GO TO LAW WITH YOU FOR
THUS CARRYING A DAGGER IN PARIS IN THE TEETH OF THE ORDINANCES AND
PROHIBITIONS OF M
THE PROVOST
NEVERTHELESS YOU ARE NOT IGNORANT OF
THE FACT THAT NOEL LESCRIVAIN WAS CONDEMNED A WEEK AGO TO PAY TEN
PARISIAN SOUS FOR HAVING CARRIED A CUTLASS
BUT THIS IS NO AFFAIR OF
MINE AND I WILL COME TO THE POINT
I SWEAR TO YOU UPON MY SHARE OF
PARADISE NOT TO APPROACH YOU WITHOUT YOUR LEAVE AND PERMISSION BUT DO
GIVE ME SOME SUPPER
THE TRUTH IS GRINGOIRE WAS LIKE M
DESPREAUX NOT VERY VOLUPTUOUS
HE DID NOT BELONG TO THAT CHEVALIER AND MUSKETEER SPECIES WHO TAKE
YOUNG GIRLS BY ASSAULT
IN THE MATTER OF LOVE AS IN ALL OTHER AFFAIRS
HE WILLINGLY ASSENTED TO TEMPORIZING AND ADJUSTING TERMS AND A GOOD
SUPPER AND AN AMIABLE TTE A TTE APPEARED TO HIM ESPECIALLY WHEN
HE WAS HUNGRY AN EXCELLENT INTERLUDE BETWEEN THE PROLOGUE AND THE
CATASTROPHE OF A LOVE ADVENTURE
THE GYPSY DID NOT REPLY
SHE MADE HER DISDAINFUL LITTLE GRIMACE DREW
UP HER HEAD LIKE A BIRD THEN BURST OUT LAUGHING AND THE TINY PONIARD
DISAPPEARED AS IT HAD COME WITHOUT GRINGOIRE BEING ABLE TO SEE WHERE
THE WASP CONCEALED ITS STING
A MOMENT LATER THERE STOOD UPON THE TABLE A LOAF OF RYE BREAD A SLICE
OF BACON SOME WRINKLED APPLES AND A JUG OF BEER
GRINGOIRE BEGAN TO EAT
EAGERLY
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HEAR THE FURIOUS CLASHING OF HIS
IRON FORK AND HIS EARTHENWARE PLATE THAT ALL HIS LOVE HAD TURNED TO
APPETITE
THE YOUNG GIRL SEATED OPPOSITE HIM WATCHED HIM IN SILENCE VISIBLY
PREOCCUPIED WITH ANOTHER THOUGHT AT WHICH SHE SMILED FROM TIME TO TIME
WHILE HER SOFT HAND CARESSED THE INTELLIGENT HEAD OF THE GOAT GENTLY
PRESSED BETWEEN HER KNEES
A CANDLE OF YELLOW WAX ILLUMINATED THIS SCENE OF VORACITY AND REVERY
MEANWHILE THE FIRST CRAVINGS OF HIS STOMACH HAVING BEEN STILLED
GRINGOIRE FELT SOME FALSE SHAME AT PERCEIVING THAT NOTHING REMAINED BUT
ONE APPLE
YOU DO NOT EAT MADEMOISELLE ESMERALDA
SHE REPLIED BY A NEGATIVE SIGN OF THE HEAD AND HER PENSIVE GLANCE FIXED
ITSELF UPON THE VAULT OF THE CEILING
WHAT THE DEUCE IS SHE THINKING OF THOUGHT GRINGOIRE STARING AT WHAT
SHE WAS GAZING AT 'TIS IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT CAN BE THAT STONE DWARF
CARVED IN THE KEYSTONE OF THAT ARCH WHICH THUS ABSORBS HER ATTENTION
WHAT THE DEUCE I CAN BEAR THE COMPARISON
HE RAISED HIS VOICE MADEMOISELLE
SHE SEEMED NOT TO HEAR HIM
HE REPEATED STILL MORE LOUDLY MADEMOISELLE ESMERALDA
TROUBLE WASTED
THE YOUNG GIRL'S MIND WAS ELSEWHERE AND GRINGOIRE'S
VOICE HAD NOT THE POWER TO RECALL IT
FORTUNATELY THE GOAT INTERFERED
SHE BEGAN TO PULL HER MISTRESS GENTLY BY THE SLEEVE
WHAT DOST THOU WANT DJALI SAID THE GYPSY HASTILY AS THOUGH
SUDDENLY AWAKENED
SHE IS HUNGRY SAID GRINGOIRE CHARMED TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION
ESMERALDA BEGAN TO CRUMBLE SOME BREAD WHICH DJALI ATE GRACEFULLY FROM
THE HOLLOW OF HER HAND
MOREOVER GRINGOIRE DID NOT GIVE HER TIME TO RESUME HER REVERY
HE
HAZARDED A DELICATE QUESTION
SO YOU DON'T WANT ME FOR YOUR HUSBAND
THE YOUNG GIRL LOOKED AT HIM INTENTLY AND SAID NO
FOR YOUR LOVER WENT ON GRINGOIRE
SHE POUTED AND REPLIED NO
FOR YOUR FRIEND PURSUED GRINGOIRE
SHE GAZED FIXEDLY AT HIM AGAIN AND SAID AFTER A MOMENTARY REFLECTION
PERHAPS
THIS PERHAPS SO DEAR TO PHILOSOPHERS EMBOLDENED GRINGOIRE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT FRIENDSHIP IS HE ASKED
YES REPLIED THE GYPSY IT IS TO BE BROTHER AND SISTER TWO SOULS
WHICH TOUCH WITHOUT MINGLING TWO FINGERS ON ONE HAND
AND LOVE PURSUED GRINGOIRE
OH LOVE SAID SHE AND HER VOICE TREMBLED AND HER EYE BEAMED
THAT
IS TO BE TWO AND TO BE BUT ONE
A MAN AND A WOMAN MINGLED INTO ONE
ANGEL
IT IS HEAVEN
THE STREET DANCER HAD A BEAUTY AS SHE SPOKE THUS THAT STRUCK GRINGOIRE
SINGULARLY AND SEEMED TO HIM IN PERFECT KEEPING WITH THE ALMOST
ORIENTAL EXALTATION OF HER WORDS
HER PURE RED LIPS HALF SMILED
HER SERENE AND CANDID BROW BECAME TROUBLED AT INTERVALS UNDER HER
THOUGHTS LIKE A MIRROR UNDER THE BREATH AND FROM BENEATH HER LONG
DROOPING BLACK EYELASHES THERE ESCAPED A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT
WHICH GAVE TO HER PROFILE THAT IDEAL SERENITY WHICH RAPHAEL FOUND AT THE
MYSTIC POINT OF INTERSECTION OF VIRGINITY MATERNITY AND DIVINITY
NEVERTHELESS GRINGOIRE CONTINUED
WHAT MUST ONE BE THEN IN ORDER TO PLEASE YOU
A MAN
AND I SAID HE WHAT THEN AM I
A MAN HAS A HEMLET ON HIS HEAD A SWORD IN HIS HAND AND GOLDEN SPURS
ON HIS HEELS
GOOD SAID GRINGOIRE WITHOUT A HORSE NO MAN
DO YOU LOVE ANY ONE
AS A LOVER
YES
SHE REMAINED THOUGHTFUL FOR A MOMENT THEN SAID WITH A PECULIAR
EXPRESSION THAT I SHALL KNOW SOON
WHY NOT THIS EVENING RESUMED THE POET TENDERLY
WHY NOT ME
SHE CAST A GRAVE GLANCE UPON HIM AND SAID
I CAN NEVER LOVE A MAN WHO CANNOT PROTECT ME
GRINGOIRE COLORED AND TOOK THE HINT
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE YOUNG GIRL
WAS ALLUDING TO THE SLIGHT ASSISTANCE WHICH HE HAD RENDERED HER IN THE
CRITICAL SITUATION IN WHICH SHE HAD FOUND HERSELF TWO HOURS PREVIOUSLY
THIS MEMORY EFFACED BY HIS OWN ADVENTURES OF THE EVENING NOW RECURRED
TO HIM
HE SMOTE HIS BROW
BY THE WAY MADEMOISELLE I OUGHT TO HAVE BEGUN THERE
PARDON MY
FOOLISH ABSENCE OF MIND
HOW DID YOU CONTRIVE TO ESCAPE FROM THE CLAWS
OF QUASIMODO
THIS QUESTION MADE THE GYPSY SHUDDER
OH THE HORRIBLE HUNCHBACK SAID SHE HIDING HER FACE IN HER HANDS
AND SHE SHUDDERED AS THOUGH WITH VIOLENT COLD
HORRIBLE IN TRUTH SAID GRINGOIRE WHO CLUNG TO HIS IDEA BUT HOW
DID YOU MANAGE TO ESCAPE HIM
LA ESMERALDA SMILED SIGHED AND REMAINED SILENT
DO YOU KNOW WHY HE FOLLOWED YOU BEGAN GRINGOIRE AGAIN SEEKING TO
RETURN TO HIS QUESTION BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE
I DON'T KNOW SAID THE YOUNG GIRL AND SHE ADDED HASTILY BUT YOU
WERE FOLLOWING ME ALSO WHY WERE YOU FOLLOWING ME
IN GOOD FAITH RESPONDED GRINGOIRE I DON'T KNOW EITHER
SILENCE ENSUED
GRINGOIRE SLASHED THE TABLE WITH HIS KNIFE
THE YOUNG
GIRL SMILED AND SEEMED TO BE GAZING THROUGH THE WALL AT SOMETHING
ALL
AT ONCE SHE BEGAN TO SING IN A BARELY ARTICULATE VOICE
QUANDO LAS PINTADAS AVES
MUDAS ESTAN Y LA TIERRA
WHEN THE GAY PLUMAGED BIRDS GROW WEARY AND THE EARTH
SHE BROKE OFF ABRUPTLY AND BEGAN TO CARESS DJALI
THAT'S A PRETTY ANIMAL OF YOURS SAID GRINGOIRE
SHE IS MY SISTER SHE ANSWERED
WHY ARE YOU CALLED 'LA ESMERALDA ASKED THE POET
I DO NOT KNOW
BUT WHY
SHE DREW FROM HER BOSOM A SORT OF LITTLE OBLONG BAG SUSPENDED FROM HER
NECK BY A STRING OF ADRZARACH BEADS
THIS BAG EXHALED A STRONG ODOR OF
CAMPHOR
IT WAS COVERED WITH GREEN SILK AND BORE IN ITS CENTRE A LARGE
PIECE OF GREEN GLASS IN IMITATION OF AN EMERALD
PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS SAID SHE
GRINGOIRE WAS ON THE POINT OF TAKING THE BAG IN HIS HAND
SHE DREW BACK
DON'T TOUCH IT IT IS AN AMULET
YOU WOULD INJURE THE CHARM OR THE
CHARM WOULD INJURE YOU
THE POET'S CURIOSITY WAS MORE AND MORE AROUSED
WHO GAVE IT TO YOU
SHE LAID ONE FINGER ON HER MOUTH AND CONCEALED THE AMULET IN HER BOSOM
HE TRIED A FEW MORE QUESTIONS BUT SHE HARDLY REPLIED
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE WORDS 'LA ESMERALDA
I DON'T KNOW SAID SHE
TO WHAT LANGUAGE DO THEY BELONG
THEY ARE EGYPTIAN I THINK
I SUSPECTED AS MUCH SAID GRINGOIRE YOU ARE NOT A NATIVE OF FRANCE
I DON'T KNOW
ARE YOUR PARENTS ALIVE
SHE BEGAN TO SING TO AN ANCIENT AIR
MON PRE EST OISEAU
MA MRE EST OISELLE
JE PASSE L'EAU SANS NACELLE
JE PASSE L'EAU SANS BATEAU
MA MRE EST OISELLE
MON PRE EST OISEAU
MY FATHER IS A BIRD MY MOTHER IS A BIRD
I CROSS THE
WATER WITHOUT A BARQUE I CROSS THE WATER WITHOUT A BOAT
MY MOTHER IS A
BIRD MY FATHER IS A BIRD
GOOD SAID GRINGOIRE
AT WHAT AGE DID YOU COME TO FRANCE
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG
AND WHEN TO PARIS
LAST YEAR
AT THE MOMENT WHEN WE WERE ENTERING THE PAPAL GATE I SAW
A REED WARBLER FLIT THROUGH THE AIR THAT WAS AT THE END OF AUGUST I
SAID IT WILL BE A HARD WINTER
SO IT WAS SAID GRINGOIRE DELIGHTED AT THIS BEGINNING OF A
CONVERSATION
I PASSED IT IN BLOWING MY FINGERS
SO YOU HAVE THE GIFT
OF PROPHECY
SHE RETIRED INTO HER LACONICS AGAIN
IS THAT MAN WHOM YOU CALL THE DUKE OF EGYPT THE CHIEF OF YOUR TRIBE
YES
BUT IT WAS HE WHO MARRIED US REMARKED THE POET TIMIDLY
SHE MADE HER CUSTOMARY PRETTY GRIMACE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME
MY NAME IF YOU WANT IT HERE IT IS PIERRE GRINGOIRE
I KNOW A PRETTIER ONE SAID SHE
NAUGHTY GIRL RETORTED THE POET
NEVER MIND YOU SHALL NOT PROVOKE
ME
WAIT PERHAPS YOU WILL LOVE ME MORE WHEN YOU KNOW ME BETTER AND
THEN YOU HAVE TOLD ME YOUR STORY WITH SO MUCH CONFIDENCE THAT I
OWE YOU A LITTLE OF MINE
YOU MUST KNOW THEN THAT MY NAME IS PIERRE
GRINGOIRE AND THAT I AM A SON OF THE FARMER OF THE NOTARY'S OFFICE
OF GONESSE
MY FATHER WAS HUNG BY THE BURGUNDIANS AND MY MOTHER
DISEMBOWELLED BY THE PICARDS AT THE SIEGE OF PARIS TWENTY YEARS AGO
AT SIX YEARS OF AGE THEREFORE I WAS AN ORPHAN WITHOUT A SOLE TO
MY FOOT EXCEPT THE PAVEMENTS OF PARIS
I DO NOT KNOW HOW I PASSED THE
INTERVAL FROM SIX TO SIXTEEN
A FRUIT DEALER GAVE ME A PLUM HERE A
BAKER FLUNG ME A CRUST THERE IN THE EVENING I GOT MYSELF TAKEN UP
BY THE WATCH WHO THREW ME INTO PRISON AND THERE I FOUND A BUNDLE OF
STRAW
ALL THIS DID NOT PREVENT MY GROWING UP AND GROWING THIN AS YOU
SEE
IN THE WINTER I WARMED MYSELF IN THE SUN UNDER THE PORCH OF THE
HTEL DE SENS AND I THOUGHT IT VERY RIDICULOUS THAT THE FIRE ON SAINT
JOHN'S DAY WAS RESERVED FOR THE DOG DAYS
AT SIXTEEN I WISHED TO CHOOSE
A CALLING
I TRIED ALL IN SUCCESSION
I BECAME A SOLDIER BUT I WAS NOT
BRAVE ENOUGH
I BECAME A MONK BUT I WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEVOUT AND
THEN I'M A BAD HAND AT DRINKING
IN DESPAIR I BECAME AN APPRENTICE
OF THE WOODCUTTERS BUT I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH I HAD MORE OF AN
INCLINATION TO BECOME A SCHOOLMASTER 'TIS TRUE THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW
TO READ BUT THAT'S NO REASON
I PERCEIVED AT THE END OF A CERTAIN TIME
THAT I LACKED SOMETHING IN EVERY DIRECTION AND SEEING THAT I WAS GOOD
FOR NOTHING OF MY OWN FREE WILL I BECAME A POET AND RHYMESTER
THAT
IS A TRADE WHICH ONE CAN ALWAYS ADOPT WHEN ONE IS A VAGABOND AND IT'S
BETTER THAN STEALING AS SOME YOUNG BRIGANDS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE ADVISED
ME TO DO
ONE DAY I MET BY LUCK DOM CLAUDE FROLLO THE REVEREND
ARCHDEACON OF NOTRE DAME
HE TOOK AN INTEREST IN ME AND IT IS TO HIM
THAT I TO DAY OWE IT THAT I AM A VERITABLE MAN OF LETTERS WHO KNOWS
LATIN FROM THE DE OFFICIIS OF CICERO TO THE MORTUOLOGY OF THE
CELESTINE FATHERS AND A BARBARIAN NEITHER IN SCHOLASTICS NOR IN
POLITICS NOR IN RHYTHMICS THAT SOPHISM OF SOPHISMS
I AM THE AUTHOR
OF THE MYSTERY WHICH WAS PRESENTED TO DAY WITH GREAT TRIUMPH AND A GREAT
CONCOURSE OF POPULACE IN THE GRAND HALL OF THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE
I HAVE ALSO MADE A BOOK WHICH WILL CONTAIN SIX HUNDRED PAGES ON THE
WONDERFUL COMET OF 1465 WHICH SENT ONE MAN MAD
I HAVE ENJOYED STILL
OTHER SUCCESSES
BEING SOMEWHAT OF AN ARTILLERY CARPENTER I LENT A HAND
TO JEAN MANGUE'S GREAT BOMBARD WHICH BURST AS YOU KNOW ON THE DAY
WHEN IT WAS TESTED ON THE PONT DE CHARENTON AND KILLED FOUR AND TWENTY
CURIOUS SPECTATORS
YOU SEE THAT I AM NOT A BAD MATCH IN MARRIAGE
I
KNOW A GREAT MANY SORTS OF VERY ENGAGING TRICKS WHICH I WILL TEACH YOUR
GOAT FOR EXAMPLE TO MIMIC THE BISHOP OF PARIS THAT CURSED PHARISEE
WHOSE MILL WHEELS SPLASH PASSERS BY THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE PONT AUX
MEUNIERS
AND THEN MY MYSTERY WILL BRING ME IN A GREAT DEAL OF COINED
MONEY IF THEY WILL ONLY PAY ME
AND FINALLY I AM AT YOUR ORDERS I AND
MY WITS AND MY SCIENCE AND MY LETTERS READY TO LIVE WITH YOU DAMSEL
AS IT SHALL PLEASE YOU CHASTELY OR JOYOUSLY HUSBAND AND WIFE IF YOU
SEE FIT BROTHER AND SISTER IF YOU THINK THAT BETTER
GRINGOIRE CEASED AWAITING THE EFFECT OF HIS HARANGUE ON THE YOUNG GIRL
HER EYES WERE FIXED ON THE GROUND
'PHOEBUS SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE POET
'PHOEBUS' WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
GRINGOIRE WITHOUT EXACTLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE CONNECTION COULD BE
BETWEEN HIS ADDRESS AND THIS QUESTION WAS NOT SORRY TO DISPLAY HIS
ERUDITION
ASSUMING AN AIR OF IMPORTANCE HE REPLIED
IT IS A LATIN WORD WHICH MEANS 'SUN
SUN SHE REPEATED
IT IS THE NAME OF A HANDSOME ARCHER WHO WAS A GOD ADDED GRINGOIRE
A GOD REPEATED THE GYPSY AND THERE WAS SOMETHING PENSIVE AND
PASSIONATE IN HER TONE
AT THAT MOMENT ONE OF HER BRACELETS BECAME UNFASTENED AND FELL
GRINGOIRE STOOPED QUICKLY TO PICK IT UP WHEN HE STRAIGHTENED UP THE
YOUNG GIRL AND THE GOAT HAD DISAPPEARED
HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A BOLT
IT WAS A LITTLE DOOR COMMUNICATING NO DOUBT WITH A NEIGHBORING CELL
WHICH WAS BEING FASTENED ON THE OUTSIDE
HAS SHE LEFT ME A BED AT LEAST SAID OUR PHILOSOPHER
HE MADE THE TOUR OF HIS CELL
THERE WAS NO PIECE OF FURNITURE ADAPTED TO
SLEEPING PURPOSES EXCEPT A TOLERABLY LONG WOODEN COFFER AND ITS COVER
WAS CARVED TO BOOT WHICH AFFORDED GRINGOIRE WHEN HE STRETCHED HIMSELF
OUT UPON IT A SENSATION SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH MICROMGAS WOULD
FEEL IF HE WERE TO LIE DOWN ON THE ALPS
COME SAID HE ADJUSTING HIMSELF AS WELL AS POSSIBLE I MUST RESIGN
MYSELF
BUT HERE'S A STRANGE NUPTIAL NIGHT
'TIS A PITY
THERE WAS
SOMETHING INNOCENT AND ANTEDILUVIAN ABOUT THAT BROKEN CROCK WHICH QUITE
PLEASED ME
BOOK THIRD
CHAPTER I
NOTRE DAME
THE CHURCH OF NOTRE DAME DE PARIS IS STILL NO DOUBT A MAJESTIC AND
SUBLIME EDIFICE
BUT BEAUTIFUL AS IT HAS BEEN PRESERVED IN GROWING OLD
IT IS DIFFICULT NOT TO SIGH NOT TO WAX INDIGNANT BEFORE THE NUMBERLESS
DEGRADATIONS AND MUTILATIONS WHICH TIME AND MEN HAVE BOTH CAUSED THE
VENERABLE MONUMENT TO SUFFER WITHOUT RESPECT FOR CHARLEMAGNE WHO LAID
ITS FIRST STONE OR FOR PHILIP AUGUSTUS WHO LAID THE LAST
ON THE FACE OF THIS AGED QUEEN OF OUR CATHEDRALS BY THE SIDE OF A
WRINKLE ONE ALWAYS FINDS A SCAR
TEMPUS EDAX HOMO EDACIOR WHICH I
SHOULD BE GLAD TO TRANSLATE THUS TIME IS BLIND MAN IS STUPID
TIME IS A DEVOURER MAN MORE SO
IF WE HAD LEISURE TO EXAMINE WITH THE READER ONE BY ONE THE DIVERSE
TRACES OF DESTRUCTION IMPRINTED UPON THE OLD CHURCH TIME'S SHARE WOULD
BE THE LEAST THE SHARE OF MEN THE MOST ESPECIALLY THE MEN OF ART
SINCE THERE HAVE BEEN INDIVIDUALS WHO ASSUMED THE TITLE OF ARCHITECTS
DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES
AND IN THE FIRST PLACE TO CITE ONLY A FEW LEADING EXAMPLES THERE
CERTAINLY ARE FEW FINER ARCHITECTURAL PAGES THAN THIS FAADE WHERE
SUCCESSIVELY AND AT ONCE THE THREE PORTALS HOLLOWED OUT IN AN ARCH THE
BROIDERED AND DENTATED CORDON OF THE EIGHT AND TWENTY ROYAL NICHES THE
IMMENSE CENTRAL ROSE WINDOW FLANKED BY ITS TWO LATERAL WINDOWS LIKE
A PRIEST BY HIS DEACON AND SUBDEACON THE FRAIL AND LOFTY GALLERY OF
TREFOIL ARCADES WHICH SUPPORTS A HEAVY PLATFORM ABOVE ITS FINE SLENDER
COLUMNS AND LASTLY THE TWO BLACK AND MASSIVE TOWERS WITH THEIR SLATE
PENTHOUSES HARMONIOUS PARTS OF A MAGNIFICENT WHOLE SUPERPOSED IN FIVE
GIGANTIC STORIES DEVELOP THEMSELVES BEFORE THE EYE IN A MASS AND
WITHOUT CONFUSION WITH THEIR INNUMERABLE DETAILS OF STATUARY CARVING
AND SCULPTURE JOINED POWERFULLY TO THE TRANQUIL GRANDEUR OF THE WHOLE
A VAST SYMPHONY IN STONE SO TO SPEAK THE COLOSSAL WORK OF ONE MAN
AND ONE PEOPLE ALL TOGETHER ONE AND COMPLEX LIKE THE ILIADS AND THE
ROMANCEROS WHOSE SISTER IT IS PRODIGIOUS PRODUCT OF THE GROUPING
TOGETHER OF ALL THE FORCES OF AN EPOCH WHERE UPON EACH STONE ONE SEES
THE FANCY OF THE WORKMAN DISCIPLINED BY THE GENIUS OF THE ARTIST START
FORTH IN A HUNDRED FASHIONS A SORT OF HUMAN CREATION IN A WORD
POWERFUL AND FECUND AS THE DIVINE CREATION OF WHICH IT SEEMS TO HAVE
STOLEN THE DOUBLE CHARACTER VARIETY ETERNITY
AND WHAT WE HERE SAY OF THE FAADE MUST BE SAID OF THE ENTIRE CHURCH
AND WHAT WE SAY OF THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF PARIS MUST BE SAID OF ALL
THE CHURCHES OF CHRISTENDOM IN THE MIDDLE AGES
ALL THINGS ARE IN PLACE
IN THAT ART SELF CREATED LOGICAL AND WELL PROPORTIONED
TO MEASURE
THE GREAT TOE OF THE FOOT IS TO MEASURE THE GIANT
LET US RETURN TO THE FAADE OF NOTRE DAME AS IT STILL APPEARS TO US
WHEN WE GO PIOUSLY TO ADMIRE THE GRAVE AND PUISSANT CATHEDRAL WHICH
INSPIRES TERROR SO ITS CHRONICLES ASSERT QU MOLE SUA TERROREM
INCUTIT SPECTANTIBUS
THREE IMPORTANT THINGS ARE TO DAY LACKING IN THAT FAADE IN THE FIRST
PLACE THE STAIRCASE OF ELEVEN STEPS WHICH FORMERLY RAISED IT ABOVE THE
SOIL NEXT THE LOWER SERIES OF STATUES WHICH OCCUPIED THE NICHES OF
THE THREE PORTALS AND LASTLY THE UPPER SERIES OF THE TWENTY EIGHT MOST
ANCIENT KINGS OF FRANCE WHICH GARNISHED THE GALLERY OF THE FIRST STORY
BEGINNING WITH CHILDEBERT AND ENDING WITH PHILLIP AUGUSTUS HOLDING IN
HIS HAND THE IMPERIAL APPLE
TIME HAS CAUSED THE STAIRCASE TO DISAPPEAR BY RAISING THE SOIL OF THE
CITY WITH A SLOW AND IRRESISTIBLE PROGRESS BUT WHILE THUS CAUSING THE
ELEVEN STEPS WHICH ADDED TO THE MAJESTIC HEIGHT OF THE EDIFICE TO
BE DEVOURED ONE BY ONE BY THE RISING TIDE OF THE PAVEMENTS OF
PARIS TIME HAS BESTOWED UPON THE CHURCH PERHAPS MORE THAN IT HAS TAKEN
AWAY FOR IT IS TIME WHICH HAS SPREAD OVER THE FAADE THAT SOMBRE HUE OF
THE CENTURIES WHICH MAKES THE OLD AGE OF MONUMENTS THE PERIOD OF THEIR
BEAUTY
BUT WHO HAS THROWN DOWN THE TWO ROWS OF STATUES WHO HAS LEFT THE NICHES
EMPTY WHO HAS CUT IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE CENTRAL PORTAL THAT NEW
AND BASTARD ARCH WHO HAS DARED TO FRAME THEREIN THAT COMMONPLACE AND
HEAVY DOOR OF CARVED WOOD LA LOUIS XV BESIDE THE ARABESQUES OF
BISCORNETTE THE MEN THE ARCHITECTS THE ARTISTS OF OUR DAY
AND IF WE ENTER THE INTERIOR OF THE EDIFICE WHO HAS OVERTHROWN THAT
COLOSSUS OF SAINT CHRISTOPHER PROVERBIAL FOR MAGNITUDE AMONG STATUES
AS THE GRAND HALL OF THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE WAS AMONG HALLS AS THE SPIRE
OF STRASBOURG AMONG SPIRES AND THOSE MYRIADS OF STATUES WHICH PEOPLED
ALL THE SPACES BETWEEN THE COLUMNS OF THE NAVE AND THE CHOIR KNEELING
STANDING EQUESTRIAN MEN WOMEN CHILDREN KINGS BISHOPS GENDARMES
IN STONE IN MARBLE IN GOLD IN SILVER IN COPPER IN WAX EVEN WHO
HAS BRUTALLY SWEPT THEM AWAY IT IS NOT TIME
AND WHO SUBSTITUTED FOR THE ANCIENT GOTHIC ALTAR SPLENDIDLY ENCUMBERED
WITH SHRINES AND RELIQUARIES THAT HEAVY MARBLE SARCOPHAGUS WITH
ANGELS' HEADS AND CLOUDS WHICH SEEMS A SPECIMEN PILLAGED FROM
THE VAL DE GRCE OR THE INVALIDES WHO STUPIDLY SEALED THAT HEAVY
ANACHRONISM OF STONE IN THE CARLOVINGIAN PAVEMENT OF HERCANDUS WAS IT
NOT LOUIS XIV FULFILLING THE REQUEST OF LOUIS XIII
AND WHO PUT THE COLD WHITE PANES IN THE PLACE OF THOSE WINDOWS HIGH
IN COLOR WHICH CAUSED THE ASTONISHED EYES OF OUR FATHERS TO HESITATE
BETWEEN THE ROSE OF THE GRAND PORTAL AND THE ARCHES OF THE APSE AND
WHAT WOULD A SUB CHANTER OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY SAY ON BEHOLDING
THE BEAUTIFUL YELLOW WASH WITH WHICH OUR ARCHIEPISCOPAL VANDALS HAVE
DESMEARED THEIR CATHEDRAL HE WOULD REMEMBER THAT IT WAS THE COLOR WITH
WHICH THE HANGMAN SMEARED ACCURSED EDIFICES HE WOULD RECALL THE
HTEL DU PETIT BOURBON ALL SMEARED THUS ON ACCOUNT OF THE CONSTABLE'S
TREASON
YELLOW AFTER ALL OF SO GOOD A QUALITY SAID SAUVAL AND SO
WELL RECOMMENDED THAT MORE THAN A CENTURY HAS NOT YET CAUSED IT TO LOSE
ITS COLOR HE WOULD THINK THAT THE SACRED PLACE HAD BECOME INFAMOUS
AND WOULD FLEE
AND IF WE ASCEND THE CATHEDRAL WITHOUT MENTIONING A THOUSAND BARBARISMS
OF EVERY SORT WHAT HAS BECOME OF THAT CHARMING LITTLE BELL TOWER
WHICH RESTED UPON THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF THE CROSS ROOFS
AND WHICH NO LESS FRAIL AND NO LESS BOLD THAN ITS NEIGHBOR ALSO
DESTROYED THE SPIRE OF THE SAINTE CHAPELLE BURIED ITSELF IN THE SKY
FARTHER FORWARD THAN THE TOWERS SLENDER POINTED SONOROUS CARVED
IN OPEN WORK
AN ARCHITECT OF GOOD TASTE AMPUTATED IT 1787 AND
CONSIDERED IT SUFFICIENT TO MASK THE WOUND WITH THAT LARGE LEADEN
PLASTER WHICH RESEMBLES A POT COVER
'TIS THUS THAT THE MARVELLOUS ART OF THE MIDDLE AGES HAS BEEN TREATED IN
NEARLY EVERY COUNTRY ESPECIALLY IN FRANCE
ONE CAN DISTINGUISH ON
ITS RUINS THREE SORTS OF LESIONS ALL THREE OF WHICH CUT INTO IT AT
DIFFERENT DEPTHS FIRST TIME WHICH HAS INSENSIBLY NOTCHED ITS SURFACE
HERE AND THERE AND GNAWED IT EVERYWHERE NEXT POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS
REVOLUTION WHICH BLIND AND WRATHFUL BY NATURE HAVE FLUNG THEMSELVES
TUMULTUOUSLY UPON IT TORN ITS RICH GARMENT OF CARVING AND SCULPTURE
BURST ITS ROSE WINDOWS BROKEN ITS NECKLACE OF ARABESQUES AND TINY
FIGURES TORN OUT ITS STATUES SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THEIR MITRES
SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THEIR CROWNS LASTLY FASHIONS EVEN MORE GROTESQUE
AND FOOLISH WHICH SINCE THE ANARCHICAL AND SPLENDID DEVIATIONS OF
THE RENAISSANCE HAVE FOLLOWED EACH OTHER IN THE NECESSARY DECADENCE
OF ARCHITECTURE
FASHIONS HAVE WROUGHT MORE HARM THAN REVOLUTIONS
THEY
HAVE CUT TO THE QUICK THEY HAVE ATTACKED THE VERY BONE AND FRAMEWORK OF
ART THEY HAVE CUT SLASHED DISORGANIZED KILLED THE EDIFICE IN FORM
AS IN THE SYMBOL IN ITS CONSISTENCY AS WELL AS IN ITS BEAUTY
AND
THEN THEY HAVE MADE IT OVER A PRESUMPTION OF WHICH NEITHER TIME NOR
REVOLUTIONS AT LEAST HAVE BEEN GUILTY
THEY HAVE AUDACIOUSLY ADJUSTED
IN THE NAME OF GOOD TASTE UPON THE WOUNDS OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE
THEIR MISERABLE GEWGAWS OF A DAY THEIR RIBBONS OF MARBLE THEIR POMPONS
OF METAL A VERITABLE LEPROSY OF EGG SHAPED ORNAMENTS VOLUTES WHORLS
DRAPERIES GARLANDS FRINGES STONE FLAMES BRONZE CLOUDS PUDGY CUPIDS
CHUBBY CHEEKED CHERUBIM WHICH BEGIN TO DEVOUR THE FACE OF ART IN THE
ORATORY OF CATHERINE DE MEDICIS AND CAUSE IT TO EXPIRE TWO CENTURIES
LATER TORTURED AND GRIMACING IN THE BOUDOIR OF THE DUBARRY
THUS TO SUM UP THE POINTS WHICH WE HAVE JUST INDICATED THREE SORTS OF
RAVAGES TO DAY DISFIGURE GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE
WRINKLES AND WARTS ON THE
EPIDERMIS THIS IS THE WORK OF TIME
DEEDS OF VIOLENCE BRUTALITIES
CONTUSIONS FRACTURES THIS IS THE WORK OF THE REVOLUTIONS FROM LUTHER
TO MIRABEAU
MUTILATIONS AMPUTATIONS DISLOCATION OF THE JOINTS
RESTORATIONS THIS IS THE GREEK ROMAN AND BARBARIAN WORK OF
PROFESSORS ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS AND VIGNOLE
THIS MAGNIFICENT ART
PRODUCED BY THE VANDALS HAS BEEN SLAIN BY THE ACADEMIES
THE CENTURIES
THE REVOLUTIONS WHICH AT LEAST DEVASTATE WITH IMPARTIALITY AND
GRANDEUR HAVE BEEN JOINED BY A CLOUD OF SCHOOL ARCHITECTS LICENSED
SWORN AND BOUND BY OATH DEFACING WITH THE DISCERNMENT AND CHOICE OF
BAD TASTE SUBSTITUTING THE CHICORES OF LOUIS XV
FOR THE GOTHIC
LACE FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF THE PARTHENON
IT IS THE KICK OF THE ASS
AT THE DYING LION
IT IS THE OLD OAK CROWNING ITSELF AND WHICH TO HEAP
THE MEASURE FULL IS STUNG BITTEN AND GNAWED BY CATERPILLARS
HOW FAR IT IS FROM THE EPOCH WHEN ROBERT CENALIS COMPARING NOTRE DAME
DE PARIS TO THE FAMOUS TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EPHESUS SO MUCH LAUDED

NOTRE DAME IS NOT MOREOVER WHAT CAN BE CALLED A COMPLETE DEFINITE
CLASSIFIED MONUMENT
IT IS NO LONGER A ROMANESQUE CHURCH NOR IS IT A
GOTHIC CHURCH
THIS EDIFICE IS NOT A TYPE
NOTRE DAME DE PARIS HAS NOT
LIKE THE ABBEY OF TOURNUS THE GRAVE AND MASSIVE FRAME THE LARGE
AND ROUND VAULT THE GLACIAL BARENESS THE MAJESTIC SIMPLICITY OF THE
EDIFICES WHICH HAVE THE ROUNDED ARCH FOR THEIR PROGENITOR
IT IS NOT
LIKE THE CATHEDRAL OF BOURGES THE MAGNIFICENT LIGHT MULTIFORM
TUFTED BRISTLING EFFLORESCENT PRODUCT OF THE POINTED ARCH
IMPOSSIBLE
TO CLASS IT IN THAT ANCIENT FAMILY OF SOMBRE MYSTERIOUS CHURCHES LOW
AND CRUSHED AS IT WERE BY THE ROUND ARCH ALMOST EGYPTIAN WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF THE CEILING ALL HIEROGLYPHICS ALL SACERDOTAL ALL
SYMBOLICAL MORE LOADED IN THEIR ORNAMENTS WITH LOZENGES AND ZIGZAGS
THAN WITH FLOWERS WITH FLOWERS THAN WITH ANIMALS WITH ANIMALS THAN
WITH MEN THE WORK OF THE ARCHITECT LESS THAN OF THE BISHOP FIRST
TRANSFORMATION OF ART ALL IMPRESSED WITH THEOCRATIC AND MILITARY
DISCIPLINE TAKING ROOT IN THE LOWER EMPIRE AND STOPPING WITH THE TIME
OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR
IMPOSSIBLE TO PLACE OUR CATHEDRAL IN THAT
OTHER FAMILY OF LOFTY AERIAL CHURCHES RICH IN PAINTED WINDOWS AND
SCULPTURE POINTED IN FORM BOLD IN ATTITUDE COMMUNAL AND BOURGEOIS AS
POLITICAL SYMBOLS FREE CAPRICIOUS LAWLESS AS A WORK OF ART SECOND
TRANSFORMATION OF ARCHITECTURE NO LONGER HIEROGLYPHIC IMMOVABLE AND
SACERDOTAL BUT ARTISTIC PROGRESSIVE AND POPULAR WHICH BEGINS AT THE
RETURN FROM THE CRUSADES AND ENDS WITH LOUIS IX
NOTRE DAME DE PARIS IS
NOT OF PURE ROMANESQUE LIKE THE FIRST NOR OF PURE ARABIAN RACE LIKE
THE SECOND
IT IS AN EDIFICE OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD
THE SAXON ARCHITECT COMPLETED
THE ERECTION OF THE FIRST PILLARS OF THE NAVE WHEN THE POINTED ARCH
WHICH DATES FROM THE CRUSADE ARRIVED AND PLACED ITSELF AS A CONQUEROR
UPON THE LARGE ROMANESQUE CAPITALS WHICH SHOULD SUPPORT ONLY ROUND
ARCHES
THE POINTED ARCH MISTRESS SINCE THAT TIME CONSTRUCTED THE REST
OF THE CHURCH
NEVERTHELESS TIMID AND INEXPERIENCED AT THE START IT
SWEEPS OUT GROWS LARGER RESTRAINS ITSELF AND DARES NO LONGER DART
UPWARDS IN SPIRES AND LANCET WINDOWS AS IT DID LATER ON IN SO MANY
MARVELLOUS CATHEDRALS
ONE WOULD SAY THAT IT WERE CONSCIOUS OF THE
VICINITY OF THE HEAVY ROMANESQUE PILLARS
HOWEVER THESE EDIFICES OF THE TRANSITION FROM THE ROMANESQUE TO THE
GOTHIC ARE NO LESS PRECIOUS FOR STUDY THAN THE PURE TYPES
THEY EXPRESS
A SHADE OF THE ART WHICH WOULD BE LOST WITHOUT THEM
IT IS THE GRAFT OF
THE POINTED UPON THE ROUND ARCH
NOTRE DAME DE PARIS IS IN PARTICULAR A CURIOUS SPECIMEN OF THIS
VARIETY
EACH FACE EACH STONE OF THE VENERABLE MONUMENT IS A PAGE NOT
ONLY OF THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY BUT OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND
ART AS WELL
THUS IN ORDER TO INDICATE HERE ONLY THE PRINCIPAL DETAILS
WHILE THE LITTLE RED DOOR ALMOST ATTAINS TO THE LIMITS OF THE GOTHIC
DELICACY OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY THE PILLARS OF THE NAVE BY THEIR
SIZE AND WEIGHT GO BACK TO THE CARLOVINGIAN ABBEY OF SAINT GERMAIN DES
PRS
ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT SIX CENTURIES SEPARATED THESE PILLARS FROM
THAT DOOR
THERE IS NO ONE NOT EVEN THE HERMETICS WHO DOES NOT FIND
IN THE SYMBOLS OF THE GRAND PORTAL A SATISFACTORY COMPENDIUM OF THEIR
SCIENCE OF WHICH THE CHURCH OF SAINT JACQUES DE LA BOUCHERIE WAS SO
COMPLETE A HIEROGLYPH
THUS THE ROMAN ABBEY THE PHILOSOPHERS' CHURCH
THE GOTHIC ART SAXON ART THE HEAVY ROUND PILLAR WHICH RECALLS
GREGORY VII THE HERMETIC SYMBOLISM WITH WHICH NICOLAS FLAMEL PLAYED
THE PRELUDE TO LUTHER PAPAL UNITY SCHISM SAINT GERMAIN DES PRS
SAINT JACQUES DE LA BOUCHERIE ALL ARE MINGLED COMBINED AMALGAMATED
IN NOTRE DAME
THIS CENTRAL MOTHER CHURCH IS AMONG THE ANCIENT CHURCHES
OF PARIS A SORT OF CHIMERA IT HAS THE HEAD OF ONE THE LIMBS OF
ANOTHER THE HAUNCHES OF ANOTHER SOMETHING OF ALL
WE REPEAT IT THESE HYBRID CONSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT THE LEAST INTERESTING
FOR THE ARTIST FOR THE ANTIQUARIAN FOR THE HISTORIAN
THEY MAKE
ONE FEEL TO WHAT A DEGREE ARCHITECTURE IS A PRIMITIVE THING BY
DEMONSTRATING WHAT IS ALSO DEMONSTRATED BY THE CYCLOPEAN VESTIGES
THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT THE GIGANTIC HINDOO PAGODAS THAT THE GREATEST
PRODUCTS OF ARCHITECTURE ARE LESS THE WORKS OF INDIVIDUALS THAN OF
SOCIETY RATHER THE OFFSPRING OF A NATION'S EFFORT THAN THE INSPIRED
FLASH OF A MAN OF GENIUS THE DEPOSIT LEFT BY A WHOLE PEOPLE THE HEAPS
ACCUMULATED BY CENTURIES THE RESIDUE OF SUCCESSIVE EVAPORATIONS OF
HUMAN SOCIETY IN A WORD SPECIES OF FORMATIONS
EACH WAVE OF TIME
CONTRIBUTES ITS ALLUVIUM EACH RACE DEPOSITS ITS LAYER ON THE MONUMENT
EACH INDIVIDUAL BRINGS HIS STONE
THUS DO THE BEAVERS THUS DO THE BEES
THUS DO MEN
THE GREAT SYMBOL OF ARCHITECTURE BABEL IS A HIVE
GREAT EDIFICES LIKE GREAT MOUNTAINS ARE THE WORK OF CENTURIES
ART
OFTEN UNDERGOES A TRANSFORMATION WHILE THEY ARE PENDING PENDENT OPERA
INTERRUPTA THEY PROCEED QUIETLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRANSFORMED
ART
THE NEW ART TAKES THE MONUMENT WHERE IT FINDS IT INCRUSTS ITSELF
THERE ASSIMILATES IT TO ITSELF DEVELOPS IT ACCORDING TO ITS FANCY
AND FINISHES IT IF IT CAN
THE THING IS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT TROUBLE
WITHOUT EFFORT WITHOUT REACTION FOLLOWING A NATURAL AND TRANQUIL
LAW
IT IS A GRAFT WHICH SHOOTS UP A SAP WHICH CIRCULATES A VEGETATION
WHICH STARTS FORTH ANEW
CERTAINLY THERE IS MATTER HERE FOR MANY LARGE
VOLUMES AND OFTEN THE UNIVERSAL HISTORY OF HUMANITY IN THE SUCCESSIVE
ENGRAFTING OF MANY ARTS AT MANY LEVELS UPON THE SAME MONUMENT
THE MAN
THE ARTIST THE INDIVIDUAL IS EFFACED IN THESE GREAT MASSES WHICH
LACK THE NAME OF THEIR AUTHOR HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IS THERE SUMMED UP AND
TOTALIZED
TIME IS THE ARCHITECT THE NATION IS THE BUILDER
NOT TO CONSIDER HERE ANYTHING EXCEPT THE CHRISTIAN ARCHITECTURE OF
EUROPE THAT YOUNGER SISTER OF THE GREAT MASONRIES OF THE ORIENT
IT APPEARS TO THE EYES AS AN IMMENSE FORMATION DIVIDED INTO THREE
WELL DEFINED ZONES WHICH ARE SUPERPOSED THE ONE UPON THE OTHER THE
ROMANESQUE ZONE THE GOTHIC ZONE THE ZONE OF THE RENAISSANCE WHICH
WE WOULD GLADLY CALL THE GRECO ROMAN ZONE
THE ROMAN LAYER WHICH IS
THE MOST ANCIENT AND DEEPEST IS OCCUPIED BY THE ROUND ARCH WHICH
REAPPEARS SUPPORTED BY THE GREEK COLUMN IN THE MODERN AND UPPER LAYER
OF THE RENAISSANCE
THE POINTED ARCH IS FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO
THE
EDIFICES WHICH BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO ANY ONE OF THESE THREE LAYERS
ARE PERFECTLY DISTINCT UNIFORM AND COMPLETE
THERE IS THE ABBEY OF
JUMIGES THERE IS THE CATHEDRAL OF REIMS THERE IS THE SAINTE CROIX OF
ORLEANS
BUT THE THREE ZONES MINGLE AND AMALGAMATE ALONG THE EDGES LIKE
THE COLORS IN THE SOLAR SPECTRUM
HENCE COMPLEX MONUMENTS EDIFICES
OF GRADATION AND TRANSITION
ONE IS ROMAN AT THE BASE GOTHIC IN THE
MIDDLE GRECO ROMAN AT THE TOP
IT IS BECAUSE IT WAS SIX HUNDRED YEARS
IN BUILDING
THIS VARIETY IS RARE
THE DONJON KEEP OF D'ETAMPES IS A
SPECIMEN OF IT
BUT MONUMENTS OF TWO FORMATIONS ARE MORE FREQUENT
THERE
IS NOTRE DAME DE PARIS A POINTED ARCH EDIFICE WHICH IS IMBEDDED BY
ITS PILLARS IN THAT ROMAN ZONE IN WHICH ARE PLUNGED THE PORTAL OF
SAINT DENIS AND THE NAVE OF SAINT GERMAIN DES PRS
THERE IS THE
CHARMING HALF GOTHIC CHAPTER HOUSE OF BOCHERVILLE WHERE THE ROMAN
LAYER EXTENDS HALF WAY UP
THERE IS THE CATHEDRAL OF ROUEN WHICH WOULD
BE ENTIRELY GOTHIC IF IT DID NOT BATHE THE TIP OF ITS CENTRAL SPIRE IN
THE ZONE OF THE RENAISSANCE
THIS IS THE SAME WHICH IS CALLED ACCORDING TO LOCALITY
CLIMATE AND RACES LOMBARD SAXON OR BYZANTINE
THERE ARE FOUR SISTER
AND PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES EACH HAVING ITS SPECIAL CHARACTER BUT
DERIVED FROM THE SAME ORIGIN THE ROUND ARCH
FACIES NON OMNIBUS UNA
NO DIVERSA TAMEN QUALEM ETC
THEIR FACES NOT ALL ALIKE NOR YET DIFFERENT BUT SUCH AS THE FACES OF
SISTERS OUGHT TO BE
THIS PORTION OF THE SPIRE WHICH WAS OF WOODWORK IS PRECISELY
THAT WHICH WAS CONSUMED BY LIGHTNING IN 1823
HOWEVER ALL THESE SHADES ALL THESE DIFFERENCES DO NOT AFFECT THE
SURFACES OF EDIFICES ONLY
IT IS ART WHICH HAS CHANGED ITS SKIN
THE
VERY CONSTITUTION OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH IS NOT ATTACKED BY IT
THERE
IS ALWAYS THE SAME INTERNAL WOODWORK THE SAME LOGICAL ARRANGEMENT
OF PARTS
WHATEVER MAY BE THE CARVED AND EMBROIDERED ENVELOPE OF A
CATHEDRAL ONE ALWAYS FINDS BENEATH IT IN THE STATE OF A GERM AND OF
A RUDIMENT AT THE LEAST THE ROMAN BASILICA
IT IS ETERNALLY DEVELOPED
UPON THE SOIL ACCORDING TO THE SAME LAW
THERE ARE INVARIABLY TWO
NAVES WHICH INTERSECT IN A CROSS AND WHOSE UPPER PORTION ROUNDED INTO
AN APSE FORMS THE CHOIR THERE ARE ALWAYS THE SIDE AISLES FOR INTERIOR
PROCESSIONS FOR CHAPELS A SORT OF LATERAL WALKS OR PROMENADES WHERE
THE PRINCIPAL NAVE DISCHARGES ITSELF THROUGH THE SPACES BETWEEN THE
PILLARS
THAT SETTLED THE NUMBER OF CHAPELS DOORS BELL TOWERS
AND PINNACLES ARE MODIFIED TO INFINITY ACCORDING TO THE FANCY OF THE
CENTURY THE PEOPLE AND ART
THE SERVICE OF RELIGION ONCE ASSURED
AND PROVIDED FOR ARCHITECTURE DOES WHAT SHE PLEASES
STATUES
STAINED GLASS ROSE WINDOWS ARABESQUES DENTICULATIONS CAPITALS
BAS RELIEFS SHE COMBINES ALL THESE IMAGININGS ACCORDING TO THE
ARRANGEMENT WHICH BEST SUITS HER
HENCE THE PRODIGIOUS EXTERIOR VARIETY
OF THESE EDIFICES AT WHOSE FOUNDATION DWELLS SO MUCH ORDER AND UNITY
THE TRUNK OF A TREE IS IMMOVABLE THE FOLIAGE IS CAPRICIOUS
CHAPTER II
A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF PARIS
WE HAVE JUST ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE FOR THE READER'S BENEFIT THAT
ADMIRABLE CHURCH OF NOTRE DAME DE PARIS
WE HAVE BRIEFLY POINTED OUT
THE GREATER PART OF THE BEAUTIES WHICH IT POSSESSED IN THE FIFTEENTH
CENTURY AND WHICH IT LACKS TO DAY BUT WE HAVE OMITTED THE PRINCIPAL
THING THE VIEW OF PARIS WHICH WAS THEN TO BE OBTAINED FROM THE SUMMITS
OF ITS TOWERS
THAT WAS IN FACT WHEN AFTER HAVING LONG GROPED ONE'S WAY UP THE DARK
SPIRAL WHICH PERPENDICULARLY PIERCES THE THICK WALL OF THE BELFRIES
ONE EMERGED AT LAST ABRUPTLY UPON ONE OF THE LOFTY PLATFORMS INUNDATED
WITH LIGHT AND AIR THAT WAS IN FACT A FINE PICTURE WHICH SPREAD
OUT ON ALL SIDES AT ONCE BEFORE THE EYE A SPECTACLE SUI GENERIS OF
WHICH THOSE OF OUR READERS WHO HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SEE A
GOTHIC CITY ENTIRE COMPLETE HOMOGENEOUS A FEW OF WHICH STILL REMAIN
NUREMBERG IN BAVARIA AND VITTORIA IN SPAIN CAN READILY FORM AN IDEA
OR EVEN SMALLER SPECIMENS PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE WELL PRESERVED VITR
IN BRITTANY NORDHAUSEN IN PRUSSIA
THE PARIS OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO THE PARIS OF THE
FIFTEENTH CENTURY WAS ALREADY A GIGANTIC CITY
WE PARISIANS GENERALLY
MAKE A MISTAKE AS TO THE GROUND WHICH WE THINK THAT WE HAVE GAINED
SINCE PARIS HAS NOT INCREASED MUCH OVER ONE THIRD SINCE THE TIME OF
LOUIS XI
IT HAS CERTAINLY LOST MORE IN BEAUTY THAN IT HAS GAINED IN
SIZE
PARIS HAD ITS BIRTH AS THE READER KNOWS IN THAT OLD ISLAND OF THE CITY
WHICH HAS THE FORM OF A CRADLE
THE STRAND OF THAT ISLAND WAS ITS
FIRST BOUNDARY WALL THE SEINE ITS FIRST MOAT
PARIS REMAINED FOR MANY
CENTURIES IN ITS ISLAND STATE WITH TWO BRIDGES ONE ON THE NORTH THE
OTHER ON THE SOUTH AND TWO BRIDGE HEADS WHICH WERE AT THE SAME TIME
ITS GATES AND ITS FORTRESSES THE GRAND CHTELET ON THE RIGHT BANK
THE PETIT CHTELET ON THE LEFT
THEN FROM THE DATE OF THE KINGS OF THE
FIRST RACE PARIS BEING TOO CRIBBED AND CONFINED IN ITS ISLAND AND
UNABLE TO RETURN THITHER CROSSED THE WATER
THEN BEYOND THE GRAND
BEYOND THE PETIT CHTELET A FIRST CIRCLE OF WALLS AND TOWERS BEGAN TO
INFRINGE UPON THE COUNTRY ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE SEINE
SOME VESTIGES
OF THIS ANCIENT ENCLOSURE STILL REMAINED IN THE LAST CENTURY TO DAY
ONLY THE MEMORY OF IT IS LEFT AND HERE AND THERE A TRADITION THE
BAUDETS OR BAUDOYER GATE PORTE BAGAUDA
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE TIDE OF HOUSES ALWAYS THRUST FROM THE HEART OF
THE CITY OUTWARDS OVERFLOWS DEVOURS WEARS AWAY AND EFFACES THIS
WALL
PHILIP AUGUSTUS MAKES A NEW DIKE FOR IT
HE IMPRISONS PARIS IN A
CIRCULAR CHAIN OF GREAT TOWERS BOTH LOFTY AND SOLID
FOR THE PERIOD OF
MORE THAN A CENTURY THE HOUSES PRESS UPON EACH OTHER ACCUMULATE AND
RAISE THEIR LEVEL IN THIS BASIN LIKE WATER IN A RESERVOIR
THEY BEGIN
TO DEEPEN THEY PILE STORY UPON STORY THEY MOUNT UPON EACH OTHER THEY
GUSH FORTH AT THE TOP LIKE ALL LATERALLY COMPRESSED GROWTH AND THERE
IS A RIVALRY AS TO WHICH SHALL THRUST ITS HEAD ABOVE ITS NEIGHBORS FOR
THE SAKE OF GETTING A LITTLE AIR
THE STREET GLOWS NARROWER AND DEEPER
EVERY SPACE IS OVERWHELMED AND DISAPPEARS
THE HOUSES FINALLY LEAP THE
WALL OF PHILIP AUGUSTUS AND SCATTER JOYFULLY OVER THE PLAIN WITHOUT
ORDER AND ALL ASKEW LIKE RUNAWAYS
THERE THEY PLANT THEMSELVES
SQUARELY CUT THEMSELVES GARDENS FROM THE FIELDS AND TAKE THEIR
EASE
BEGINNING WITH 1367 THE CITY SPREADS TO SUCH AN EXTENT INTO THE
SUBURBS THAT A NEW WALL BECOMES NECESSARY PARTICULARLY ON THE RIGHT
BANK CHARLES V
BUILDS IT
BUT A CITY LIKE PARIS IS PERPETUALLY
GROWING
IT IS ONLY SUCH CITIES THAT BECOME CAPITALS
THEY ARE FUNNELS
INTO WHICH ALL THE GEOGRAPHICAL POLITICAL MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL
WATER SHEDS OF A COUNTRY ALL THE NATURAL SLOPES OF A PEOPLE POUR
WELLS OF CIVILIZATION SO TO SPEAK AND ALSO SEWERS WHERE COMMERCE
INDUSTRY INTELLIGENCE POPULATION ALL THAT IS SAP ALL THAT IS LIFE
ALL THAT IS THE SOUL OF A NATION FILTERS AND AMASSES UNCEASINGLY DROP
BY DROP CENTURY BY CENTURY
SO CHARLES V 'S WALL SUFFERED THE FATE OF THAT OF PHILIP AUGUSTUS
AT
THE END OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY THE FAUBOURG STRIDES ACROSS IT PASSES
BEYOND IT AND RUNS FARTHER
IN THE SIXTEENTH IT SEEMS TO RETREAT
VISIBLY AND TO BURY ITSELF DEEPER AND DEEPER IN THE OLD CITY SO THICK
HAD THE NEW CITY ALREADY BECOME OUTSIDE OF IT
THUS BEGINNING WITH THE
FIFTEENTH CENTURY WHERE OUR STORY FINDS US PARIS HAD ALREADY OUTGROWN
THE THREE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES OF WALLS WHICH FROM THE TIME OF JULIAN THE
APOSTATE EXISTED SO TO SPEAK IN GERM IN THE GRAND CHTELET AND THE
PETIT CHTELET
THE MIGHTY CITY HAD CRACKED IN SUCCESSION ITS FOUR
ENCLOSURES OF WALLS LIKE A CHILD GROWN TOO LARGE FOR HIS GARMENTS OF
LAST YEAR
UNDER LOUIS XI THIS SEA OF HOUSES WAS SEEN TO BE PIERCED
AT INTERVALS BY SEVERAL GROUPS OF RUINED TOWERS FROM THE ANCIENT WALL
LIKE THE SUMMITS OF HILLS IN AN INUNDATION LIKE ARCHIPELAGOS OF THE
OLD PARIS SUBMERGED BENEATH THE NEW
SINCE THAT TIME PARIS HAS UNDERGONE
YET ANOTHER TRANSFORMATION UNFORTUNATELY FOR OUR EYES BUT IT HAS
PASSED ONLY ONE MORE WALL THAT OF LOUIS XV THAT MISERABLE WALL OF
MUD AND SPITTLE WORTHY OF THE KING WHO BUILT IT WORTHY OF THE POET WHO
SUNG IT
LE MUR MURANT PARIS REND PARIS MURMURANT
THE WALL WALLING PARIS MAKES PARIS MURMUR
IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY PARIS WAS STILL DIVIDED INTO THREE WHOLLY
DISTINCT AND SEPARATE TOWNS EACH HAVING ITS OWN PHYSIOGNOMY ITS OWN
SPECIALTY ITS MANNERS CUSTOMS PRIVILEGES AND HISTORY THE CITY THE
UNIVERSITY THE TOWN
THE CITY WHICH OCCUPIED THE ISLAND WAS THE
MOST ANCIENT THE SMALLEST AND THE MOTHER OF THE OTHER TWO CROWDED IN
BETWEEN THEM LIKE MAY WE BE PARDONED THE COMPARISON A LITTLE OLD WOMAN
BETWEEN TWO LARGE AND HANDSOME MAIDENS
THE UNIVERSITY COVERED THE LEFT
BANK OF THE SEINE FROM THE TOURNELLE TO THE TOUR DE NESLE POINTS WHICH
CORRESPOND IN THE PARIS OF TO DAY THE ONE TO THE WINE MARKET THE OTHER
TO THE MINT
ITS WALL INCLUDED A LARGE PART OF THAT PLAIN WHERE JULIAN
HAD BUILT HIS HOT BATHS
THE HILL OF SAINTE GENEVIVE WAS ENCLOSED IN
IT
THE CULMINATING POINT OF THIS SWEEP OF WALLS WAS THE PAPAL GATE
THAT IS TO SAY NEAR THE PRESENT SITE OF THE PANTHEON
THE TOWN WHICH
WAS THE LARGEST OF THE THREE FRAGMENTS OF PARIS HELD THE RIGHT BANK
ITS QUAY BROKEN OR INTERRUPTED IN MANY PLACES RAN ALONG THE SEINE
FROM THE TOUR DE BILLY TO THE TOUR DU BOIS THAT IS TO SAY FROM THE
PLACE WHERE THE GRANARY STANDS TO DAY TO THE PRESENT SITE OF THE
TUILERIES
THESE FOUR POINTS WHERE THE SEINE INTERSECTED THE WALL OF
THE CAPITAL THE TOURNELLE AND THE TOUR DE NESLE ON THE RIGHT THE TOUR
DE BILLY AND THE TOUR DU BOIS ON THE LEFT WERE CALLED PRE EMINENTLY
THE FOUR TOWERS OF PARIS THE TOWN ENCROACHED STILL MORE EXTENSIVELY
UPON THE FIELDS THAN THE UNIVERSITY
THE CULMINATING POINT OF THE
TOWN WALL THAT OF CHARLES V WAS AT THE GATES OF SAINT DENIS AND
SAINT MARTIN WHOSE SITUATION HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED
AS WE HAVE JUST SAID EACH OF THESE THREE GREAT DIVISIONS OF PARIS WAS A
TOWN BUT TOO SPECIAL A TOWN TO BE COMPLETE A CITY WHICH COULD NOT
GET ALONG WITHOUT THE OTHER TWO
HENCE THREE ENTIRELY DISTINCT ASPECTS
CHURCHES ABOUNDED IN THE CITY PALACES IN THE TOWN AND COLLEGES
IN THE UNIVERSITY
NEGLECTING HERE THE ORIGINALITIES OF SECONDARY
IMPORTANCE IN OLD PARIS AND THE CAPRICIOUS REGULATIONS REGARDING THE
PUBLIC HIGHWAYS WE WILL SAY FROM A GENERAL POINT OF VIEW TAKING ONLY
MASSES AND THE WHOLE GROUP IN THIS CHAOS OF COMMUNAL JURISDICTIONS
THAT THE ISLAND BELONGED TO THE BISHOP THE RIGHT BANK TO THE PROVOST OF
THE MERCHANTS THE LEFT BANK TO THE RECTOR OVER ALL RULED THE PROVOST
OF PARIS A ROYAL NOT A MUNICIPAL OFFICIAL
THE CITY HAD NOTRE DAME THE
TOWN THE LOUVRE AND THE HTEL DE VILLE THE UNIVERSITY THE SORBONNE
THE TOWN HAD THE MARKETS HALLES THE CITY THE HOSPITAL THE
UNIVERSITY THE PR AUX CLERCS
OFFENCES COMMITTED BY THE SCHOLARS
ON THE LEFT BANK WERE TRIED IN THE LAW COURTS ON THE ISLAND AND WERE
PUNISHED ON THE RIGHT BANK AT MONTFAUON UNLESS THE RECTOR FEELING THE
UNIVERSITY TO BE STRONG AND THE KING WEAK INTERVENED FOR IT WAS THE
STUDENTS' PRIVILEGE TO BE HANGED ON THEIR OWN GROUNDS
THE GREATER PART OF THESE PRIVILEGES IT MAY BE NOTED IN PASSING AND
THERE WERE SOME EVEN BETTER THAN THE ABOVE HAD BEEN EXTORTED FROM THE
KINGS BY REVOLTS AND MUTINIES
IT IS THE COURSE OF THINGS FROM TIME
IMMEMORIAL THE KING ONLY LETS GO WHEN THE PEOPLE TEAR AWAY
THERE IS AN
OLD CHARTER WHICH PUTS THE MATTER NAIVELY APROPOS OF FIDELITY CIVIBUS
FIDELITAS IN REGES QU TAMEN ALIQUOTIES SEDITIONIBUS INTERRYPTA MULTA
PEPERIT PRIVILEYIA
IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY THE SEINE BATHED FIVE ISLANDS WITHIN THE WALLS
OF PARIS LOUVIERS ISLAND WHERE THERE WERE THEN TREES AND WHERE THERE
IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT WOOD L'ILE AUX VACHES AND L'ILE NOTRE DAME
BOTH DESERTED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE HOUSE BOTH FIEFS OF THE
BISHOP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY A SINGLE ISLAND WAS FORMED OUT OF
THESE TWO WHICH WAS BUILT UPON AND NAMED L'ILE SAINT LOUIS LASTLY
THE CITY AND AT ITS POINT THE LITTLE ISLET OF THE COW TENDER WHICH
WAS AFTERWARDS ENGULFED BENEATH THE PLATFORM OF THE PONT NEUF
THE CITY
THEN HAD FIVE BRIDGES THREE ON THE RIGHT THE PONT NOTRE DAME AND THE
PONT AU CHANGE OF STONE THE PONT AUX MEUNIERS OF WOOD TWO ON THE
LEFT THE PETIT PONT OF STONE THE PONT SAINT MICHEL OF WOOD ALL
LOADED WITH HOUSES
THE UNIVERSITY HAD SIX GATES BUILT BY PHILIP AUGUSTUS THERE WERE
BEGINNING WITH LA TOURNELLE THE PORTE SAINT VICTOR THE PORTE BORDELLE
THE PORTE PAPALE THE PORTE SAINT JACQUES THE PORTE SAINT MICHEL
THE PORTE SAINT GERMAIN
THE TOWN HAD SIX GATES BUILT BY CHARLES V
BEGINNING WITH THE TOUR DE BILLY THEY WERE THE PORTE SAINT ANTOINE
THE PORTE DU TEMPLE THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN THE PORTE SAINT DENIS THE
PORTE MONTMARTRE THE PORTE SAINT HONOR
ALL THESE GATES WERE STRONG
AND ALSO HANDSOME WHICH DOES NOT DETRACT FROM STRENGTH
A LARGE DEEP
MOAT WITH A BRISK CURRENT DURING THE HIGH WATER OF WINTER BATHED THE
BASE OF THE WALL ROUND PARIS THE SEINE FURNISHED THE WATER
AT NIGHT
THE GATES WERE SHUT THE RIVER WAS BARRED AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CITY WITH
HUGE IRON CHAINS AND PARIS SLEPT TRANQUILLY
FROM A BIRD'S EYE VIEW THESE THREE BURGS THE CITY THE TOWN AND
THE UNIVERSITY EACH PRESENTED TO THE EYE AN INEXTRICABLE SKEIN OF
ECCENTRICALLY TANGLED STREETS
NEVERTHELESS AT FIRST SIGHT ONE
RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT THESE THREE FRAGMENTS FORMED BUT ONE BODY
ONE IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED THREE LONG PARALLEL STREETS UNBROKEN
UNDISTURBED TRAVERSING ALMOST IN A STRAIGHT LINE ALL THREE CITIES
FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER FROM NORTH TO SOUTH PERPENDICULARLY TO THE
SEINE WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER MINGLED THEM INFUSED THEM IN EACH
OTHER POURED AND TRANSFUSED THE PEOPLE INCESSANTLY FROM ONE TO THE
OTHER AND MADE ONE OUT OF THE THREE
THE FIRST OF THESE STREETS RAN
FROM THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN IT WAS CALLED THE RUE SAINT JACQUES IN
THE UNIVERSITY RUE DE LA JUIVERIE IN THE CITY RUE SAINT MARTIN IN THE
TOWN IT CROSSED THE WATER TWICE UNDER THE NAME OF THE PETIT PONT AND
THE PONT NOTRE DAME
THE SECOND WHICH WAS CALLED THE RUE DE LA HARPE
ON THE LEFT BANK RUE DE LA BARILLERI IN THE ISLAND RUE SAINT DENIS
ON THE RIGHT BANK PONT SAINT MICHEL ON ONE ARM OF THE SEINE PONT AU
CHANGE ON THE OTHER RAN FROM THE PORTE SAINT MICHEL IN THE UNIVERSITY
TO THE PORTE SAINT DENIS IN THE TOWN
HOWEVER UNDER ALL THESE NAMES
THERE WERE BUT TWO STREETS PARENT STREETS GENERATING STREETS THE TWO
ARTERIES OF PARIS
ALL THE OTHER VEINS OF THE TRIPLE CITY EITHER DERIVED
THEIR SUPPLY FROM THEM OR EMPTIED INTO THEM
INDEPENDENTLY OF THESE TWO PRINCIPAL STREETS PIERCING PARIS
DIAMETRICALLY IN ITS WHOLE BREADTH FROM SIDE TO SIDE COMMON TO THE
ENTIRE CAPITAL THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITY HAD ALSO EACH ITS OWN GREAT
SPECIAL STREET WHICH RAN LENGTHWISE BY THEM PARALLEL TO THE SEINE
CUTTING AS IT PASSED AT RIGHT ANGLES THE TWO ARTERIAL THOROUGHFARES
THUS IN THE TOWN ONE DESCENDED IN A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE PORTE
SAINT ANTOINE TO THE PORTE SAINT HONOR IN THE UNIVERSITY FROM
THE PORTE SAINT VICTOR TO THE PORTE SAINT GERMAIN
THESE TWO GREAT
THOROUGHFARES INTERSECTED BY THE TWO FIRST FORMED THE CANVAS UPON WHICH
REPOSED KNOTTED AND CROWDED TOGETHER ON EVERY HAND THE LABYRINTHINE
NETWORK OF THE STREETS OF PARIS
IN THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE PLAN OF
THESE STREETS ONE DISTINGUISHED LIKEWISE ON LOOKING ATTENTIVELY TWO
CLUSTERS OF GREAT STREETS LIKE MAGNIFIED SHEAVES OF GRAIN ONE IN THE
UNIVERSITY THE OTHER IN THE TOWN WHICH SPREAD OUT GRADUALLY FROM THE
BRIDGES TO THE GATES
SOME TRACES OF THIS GEOMETRICAL PLAN STILL EXIST TO DAY
NOW WHAT ASPECT DID THIS WHOLE PRESENT WHEN AS VIEWED FROM THE SUMMIT
OF THE TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME IN 1482 THAT WE SHALL TRY TO DESCRIBE
FOR THE SPECTATOR WHO ARRIVED PANTING UPON THAT PINNACLE IT WAS FIRST
A DAZZLING CONFUSING VIEW OF ROOFS CHIMNEYS STREETS BRIDGES PLACES
SPIRES BELL TOWERS
EVERYTHING STRUCK YOUR EYE AT ONCE THE CARVED
GABLE THE POINTED ROOF THE TURRETS SUSPENDED AT THE ANGLES OF THE
WALLS THE STONE PYRAMIDS OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY THE SLATE OBELISKS OF
THE FIFTEENTH THE ROUND BARE TOWER OF THE DONJON KEEP THE SQUARE AND
FRETTED TOWER OF THE CHURCH THE GREAT AND THE LITTLE THE MASSIVE AND
THE AERIAL
THE EYE WAS FOR A LONG TIME WHOLLY LOST IN THIS LABYRINTH
WHERE THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH DID NOT POSSESS ITS ORIGINALITY ITS
REASON ITS GENIUS ITS BEAUTY NOTHING WHICH DID NOT PROCEED FROM ART
BEGINNING WITH THE SMALLEST HOUSE WITH ITS PAINTED AND CARVED FRONT
WITH EXTERNAL BEAMS ELLIPTICAL DOOR WITH PROJECTING STORIES TO THE
ROYAL LOUVRE WHICH THEN HAD A COLONNADE OF TOWERS
BUT THESE ARE THE
PRINCIPAL MASSES WHICH WERE THEN TO BE DISTINGUISHED WHEN THE EYE BEGAN
TO ACCUSTOM ITSELF TO THIS TUMULT OF EDIFICES
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE CITY THE ISLAND OF THE CITY AS SAUVAL SAYS
WHO IN SPITE OF HIS CONFUSED MEDLEY SOMETIMES HAS SUCH HAPPY TURNS OF
EXPRESSION THE ISLAND OF THE CITY IS MADE LIKE A GREAT SHIP STUCK IN
THE MUD AND RUN AGROUND IN THE CURRENT NEAR THE CENTRE OF THE SEINE
WE HAVE JUST EXPLAINED THAT IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY THIS SHIP WAS
ANCHORED TO THE TWO BANKS OF THE RIVER BY FIVE BRIDGES
THIS FORM OF A
SHIP HAD ALSO STRUCK THE HERALDIC SCRIBES FOR IT IS FROM THAT AND
NOT FROM THE SIEGE BY THE NORMANS THAT THE SHIP WHICH BLAZONS THE OLD
SHIELD OF PARIS COMES ACCORDING TO FAVYN AND PASQUIER
FOR HIM
WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW TO DECIPHER THEM ARMORIAL BEARINGS ARE ALGEBRA
ARMORIAL BEARINGS HAVE A TONGUE
THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE SECOND HALF OF
THE MIDDLE AGES IS WRITTEN IN ARMORIAL BEARINGS THE FIRST HALF IS
IN THE SYMBOLISM OF THE ROMAN CHURCHES
THEY ARE THE HIEROGLYPHICS OF
FEUDALISM SUCCEEDING THOSE OF THEOCRACY
THUS THE CITY FIRST PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE EYE WITH ITS STERN TO THE
EAST AND ITS PROW TO THE WEST
TURNING TOWARDS THE PROW ONE HAD BEFORE
ONE AN INNUMERABLE FLOCK OF ANCIENT ROOFS OVER WHICH ARCHED BROADLY THE
LEAD COVERED APSE OF THE SAINTE CHAPELLE LIKE AN ELEPHANT'S HAUNCHES
LOADED WITH ITS TOWER
ONLY HERE THIS TOWER WAS THE MOST AUDACIOUS THE
MOST OPEN THE MOST ORNAMENTED SPIRE OF CABINET MAKER'S WORK THAT EVER
LET THE SKY PEEP THROUGH ITS CONE OF LACE
IN FRONT OF NOTRE DAME AND
VERY NEAR AT HAND THREE STREETS OPENED INTO THE CATHEDRAL SQUARE A
FINE SQUARE LINED WITH ANCIENT HOUSES
OVER THE SOUTH SIDE OF THIS
PLACE BENT THE WRINKLED AND SULLEN FAADE OF THE HTEL DIEU AND ITS
ROOF WHICH SEEMED COVERED WITH WARTS AND PUSTULES
THEN ON THE RIGHT
AND THE LEFT TO EAST AND WEST WITHIN THAT WALL OF THE CITY WHICH WAS
YET SO CONTRACTED ROSE THE BELL TOWERS OF ITS ONE AND TWENTY CHURCHES
OF EVERY DATE OF EVERY FORM OF EVERY SIZE FROM THE LOW AND WORMEATEN
BELFRY OF SAINT DENIS DU PAS CARCER GLAUEINI TO THE SLENDER NEEDLES
OF SAINT PIERRE AUX BOEUFS AND SAINT LANDRY
BEHIND NOTRE DAME THE CLOISTER AND ITS GOTHIC GALLERIES SPREAD OUT
TOWARDS THE NORTH ON THE SOUTH THE HALF ROMAN PALACE OF THE BISHOP ON
THE EAST THE DESERT POINT OF THE TERRAIN
IN THIS THRONG OF HOUSES THE
EYE ALSO DISTINGUISHED BY THE LOFTY OPEN WORK MITRES OF STONE WHICH
THEN CROWNED THE ROOF ITSELF EVEN THE MOST ELEVATED WINDOWS OF THE
PALACE THE HTEL GIVEN BY THE CITY UNDER CHARLES VI TO JUVNAL
DES URSINS A LITTLE FARTHER ON THE PITCH COVERED SHEDS OF THE PALUS
MARKET IN STILL ANOTHER QUARTER THE NEW APSE OF SAINT GERMAIN LE VIEUX
LENGTHENED IN 1458 WITH A BIT OF THE RUE AUX FEBVES AND THEN IN
PLACES A SQUARE CROWDED WITH PEOPLE A PILLORY ERECTED AT THE CORNER
OF A STREET A FINE FRAGMENT OF THE PAVEMENT OF PHILIP AUGUSTUS A
MAGNIFICENT FLAGGING GROOVED FOR THE HORSES' FEET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
ROAD AND SO BADLY REPLACED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY BY THE MISERABLE
COBBLESTONES CALLED THE PAVEMENT OF THE LEAGUE A DESERTED BACK
COURTYARD WITH ONE OF THOSE DIAPHANOUS STAIRCASE TURRETS SUCH AS WERE
ERECTED IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY ONE OF WHICH IS STILL TO BE SEEN IN
THE RUE DES BOURDONNAIS
LASTLY AT THE RIGHT OF THE SAINTE CHAPELLE
TOWARDS THE WEST THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE RESTED ITS GROUP OF TOWERS AT
THE EDGE OF THE WATER
THE THICKETS OF THE KING'S GARDENS WHICH COVERED
THE WESTERN POINT OF THE CITY MASKED THE ISLAND DU PASSEUR
AS FOR THE
WATER FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME ONE HARDLY SAW IT ON
EITHER SIDE OF THE CITY THE SEINE WAS HIDDEN BY BRIDGES THE BRIDGES BY
HOUSES
AND WHEN THE GLANCE PASSED THESE BRIDGES WHOSE ROOFS WERE VISIBLY
GREEN RENDERED MOULDY BEFORE THEIR TIME BY THE VAPORS FROM THE WATER
IF IT WAS DIRECTED TO THE LEFT TOWARDS THE UNIVERSITY THE FIRST
EDIFICE WHICH STRUCK IT WAS A LARGE LOW SHEAF OF TOWERS THE
PETIT CHTELET WHOSE YAWNING GATE DEVOURED THE END OF THE PETIT PONT
THEN IF YOUR VIEW RAN ALONG THE BANK FROM EAST TO WEST FROM THE
TOURNELLE TO THE TOUR DE NESLE THERE WAS A LONG CORDON OF HOUSES WITH
CARVED BEAMS STAINED GLASS WINDOWS EACH STORY PROJECTING OVER THAT
BENEATH IT AN INTERMINABLE ZIGZAG OF BOURGEOIS GABLES FREQUENTLY
INTERRUPTED BY THE MOUTH OF A STREET AND FROM TIME TO TIME ALSO BY THE
FRONT OR ANGLE OF A HUGE STONE MANSION PLANTED AT ITS EASE WITH COURTS
AND GARDENS WINGS AND DETACHED BUILDINGS AMID THIS POPULACE OF CROWDED
AND NARROW HOUSES LIKE A GRAND GENTLEMAN AMONG A THRONG OF RUSTICS
THERE WERE FIVE OR SIX OF THESE MANSIONS ON THE QUAY FROM THE HOUSE OF
LORRAINE WHICH SHARED WITH THE BERNARDINS THE GRAND ENCLOSURE ADJOINING
THE TOURNELLE TO THE HTEL DE NESLE WHOSE PRINCIPAL TOWER ENDED PARIS
AND WHOSE POINTED ROOFS WERE IN A POSITION DURING THREE MONTHS OF THE
YEAR TO ENCROACH WITH THEIR BLACK TRIANGLES UPON THE SCARLET DISK OF
THE SETTING SUN
THIS SIDE OF THE SEINE WAS HOWEVER THE LEAST MERCANTILE OF THE TWO
STUDENTS FURNISHED MORE OF A CROWD AND MORE NOISE THERE THAN ARTISANS
AND THERE WAS NOT PROPERLY SPEAKING ANY QUAY EXCEPT FROM THE PONT
SAINT MICHEL TO THE TOUR DE NESLE
THE REST OF THE BANK OF THE SEINE WAS
NOW A NAKED STRAND THE SAME AS BEYOND THE BERNARDINS AGAIN A THRONG
OF HOUSES STANDING WITH THEIR FEET IN THE WATER AS BETWEEN THE TWO
BRIDGES
THERE WAS A GREAT UPROAR OF LAUNDRESSES THEY SCREAMED AND TALKED AND
SANG FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT ALONG THE BEACH AND BEAT A GREAT DEAL OF
LINEN THERE JUST AS IN OUR DAY
THIS IS NOT THE LEAST OF THE GAYETIES
OF PARIS
THE UNIVERSITY PRESENTED A DENSE MASS TO THE EYE
FROM ONE END TO
THE OTHER IT WAS HOMOGENEOUS AND COMPACT
THE THOUSAND ROOFS DENSE
ANGULAR CLINGING TO EACH OTHER COMPOSED NEARLY ALL OF THE SAME
GEOMETRICAL ELEMENT OFFERED WHEN VIEWED FROM ABOVE THE ASPECT OF A
CRYSTALLIZATION OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE
THE CAPRICIOUS RAVINE OF STREETS DID NOT CUT THIS BLOCK OF HOUSES INTO
TOO DISPROPORTIONATE SLICES
THE FORTY TWO COLLEGES WERE SCATTERED ABOUT
IN A FAIRLY EQUAL MANNER AND THERE WERE SOME EVERYWHERE
THE AMUSINGLY
VARIED CRESTS OF THESE BEAUTIFUL EDIFICES WERE THE PRODUCT OF THE SAME
ART AS THE SIMPLE ROOFS WHICH THEY OVERSHOT AND WERE ACTUALLY ONLY A
MULTIPLICATION OF THE SQUARE OR THE CUBE OF THE SAME GEOMETRICAL
FIGURE
HENCE THEY COMPLICATED THE WHOLE EFFECT WITHOUT DISTURBING
IT COMPLETED WITHOUT OVERLOADING IT
GEOMETRY IS HARMONY
SOME
FINE MANSIONS HERE AND THERE MADE MAGNIFICENT OUTLINES AGAINST THE
PICTURESQUE ATTICS OF THE LEFT BANK
THE HOUSE OF NEVERS THE HOUSE OF
ROME THE HOUSE OF REIMS WHICH HAVE DISAPPEARED THE HTEL DE CLUNY
WHICH STILL EXISTS FOR THE CONSOLATION OF THE ARTIST AND WHOSE TOWER
WAS SO STUPIDLY DEPRIVED OF ITS CROWN A FEW YEARS AGO
CLOSE TO CLUNY
THAT ROMAN PALACE WITH FINE ROUND ARCHES WERE ONCE THE HOT BATHS OF
JULIAN
THERE WERE A GREAT MANY ABBEYS OF A BEAUTY MORE DEVOUT OF A
GRANDEUR MORE SOLEMN THAN THE MANSIONS BUT NOT LESS BEAUTIFUL NOT LESS
GRAND
THOSE WHICH FIRST CAUGHT THE EYE WERE THE BERNARDINS WITH THEIR
THREE BELL TOWERS SAINTE GENEVIVE WHOSE SQUARE TOWER WHICH STILL
EXISTS MAKES US REGRET THE REST THE SORBONNE HALF COLLEGE HALF
MONASTERY OF WHICH SO ADMIRABLE A NAVE SURVIVES THE FINE QUADRILATERAL
CLOISTER OF THE MATHURINS ITS NEIGHBOR THE CLOISTER OF SAINT BENOIT
WITHIN WHOSE WALLS THEY HAVE HAD TIME TO COBBLE UP A THEATRE BETWEEN
THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH EDITIONS OF THIS BOOK THE CORDELIERS WITH THEIR
THREE ENORMOUS ADJACENT GABLES THE AUGUSTINS WHOSE GRACEFUL SPIRE
FORMED AFTER THE TOUR DE NESLE THE SECOND DENTICULATION ON THIS SIDE
OF PARIS STARTING FROM THE WEST
THE COLLEGES WHICH ARE IN FACT THE
INTERMEDIATE RING BETWEEN THE CLOISTER AND THE WORLD HOLD THE MIDDLE
POSITION IN THE MONUMENTAL SERIES BETWEEN THE HTELS AND THE ABBEYS
WITH A SEVERITY FULL OF ELEGANCE SCULPTURE LESS GIDDY THAN THE PALACES
AN ARCHITECTURE LESS SEVERE THAN THE CONVENTS
UNFORTUNATELY HARDLY
ANYTHING REMAINS OF THESE MONUMENTS WHERE GOTHIC ART COMBINED WITH
SO JUST A BALANCE RICHNESS AND ECONOMY
THE CHURCHES AND THEY WERE
NUMEROUS AND SPLENDID IN THE UNIVERSITY AND THEY WERE GRADED THERE ALSO
IN ALL THE AGES OF ARCHITECTURE FROM THE ROUND ARCHES OF SAINT JULIAN
TO THE POINTED ARCHES OF SAINT SVERIN THE CHURCHES DOMINATED THE
WHOLE AND LIKE ONE HARMONY MORE IN THIS MASS OF HARMONIES THEY
PIERCED IN QUICK SUCCESSION THE MULTIPLE OPEN WORK OF THE GABLES WITH
SLASHED SPIRES WITH OPEN WORK BELL TOWERS WITH SLENDER PINNACLES
WHOSE LINE WAS ALSO ONLY A MAGNIFICENT EXAGGERATION OF THE ACUTE ANGLE
OF THE ROOFS
THE GROUND OF THE UNIVERSITY WAS HILLY MOUNT SAINTE GENEVIVE FORMED AN
ENORMOUS MOUND TO THE SOUTH AND IT WAS A SIGHT TO SEE FROM THE SUMMIT
OF NOTRE DAME HOW THAT THRONG OF NARROW AND TORTUOUS STREETS TO DAY
THE LATIN QUARTER THOSE BUNCHES OF HOUSES WHICH SPREAD OUT IN EVERY
DIRECTION FROM THE TOP OF THIS EMINENCE PRECIPITATED THEMSELVES IN
DISORDER AND ALMOST PERPENDICULARLY DOWN ITS FLANKS NEARLY TO THE
WATER'S EDGE HAVING THE AIR SOME OF FALLING OTHERS OF CLAMBERING UP
AGAIN AND ALL OF HOLDING TO ONE ANOTHER
A CONTINUAL FLUX OF A THOUSAND
BLACK POINTS WHICH PASSED EACH OTHER ON THE PAVEMENTS MADE EVERYTHING
MOVE BEFORE THE EYES IT WAS THE POPULACE SEEN THUS FROM ALOFT AND AFAR
LASTLY IN THE INTERVALS OF THESE ROOFS OF THESE SPIRES OF THESE
ACCIDENTS OF NUMBERLESS EDIFICES WHICH BENT AND WRITHED AND JAGGED IN
SO ECCENTRIC A MANNER THE EXTREME LINE OF THE UNIVERSITY ONE CAUGHT A
GLIMPSE HERE AND THERE OF A GREAT EXPANSE OF MOSS GROWN WALL A THICK
ROUND TOWER A CRENELLATED CITY GATE SHADOWING FORTH THE FORTRESS
IT WAS THE WALL OF PHILIP AUGUSTUS
BEYOND THE FIELDS GLEAMED GREEN
BEYOND FLED THE ROADS ALONG WHICH WERE SCATTERED A FEW MORE SUBURBAN
HOUSES WHICH BECAME MORE INFREQUENT AS THEY BECAME MORE DISTANT
SOME
OF THESE FAUBOURGS WERE IMPORTANT THERE WERE FIRST STARTING FROM LA
TOURNELLE THE BOURG SAINT VICTOR WITH ITS ONE ARCH BRIDGE OVER THE
BIVRE ITS ABBEY WHERE ONE COULD READ THE EPITAPH OF LOUIS LE GROS
EPITAPHIUM LUDOVICI GROSSI AND ITS CHURCH WITH AN OCTAGONAL SPIRE
FLANKED WITH FOUR LITTLE BELL TOWERS OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY A SIMILAR
ONE CAN BE SEEN AT ETAMPES IT IS NOT YET DESTROYED NEXT THE BOURG
SAINT MARCEAU WHICH ALREADY HAD THREE CHURCHES AND ONE CONVENT THEN
LEAVING THE MILL OF THE GOBELINS AND ITS FOUR WHITE WALLS ON THE LEFT
THERE WAS THE FAUBOURG SAINT JACQUES WITH THE BEAUTIFUL CARVED CROSS
IN ITS SQUARE THE CHURCH OF SAINT JACQUES DU HAUT PAS WHICH WAS THEN
GOTHIC POINTED CHARMING SAINT MAGLOIRE A FINE NAVE OF THE FOURTEENTH
CENTURY WHICH NAPOLEON TURNED INTO A HAYLOFT NOTRE DAME DES CHAMPS
WHERE THERE WERE BYZANTINE MOSAICS LASTLY AFTER HAVING LEFT BEHIND
FULL IN THE COUNTRY THE MONASTERY DES CHARTREUX A RICH EDIFICE
CONTEMPORARY WITH THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE WITH ITS LITTLE GARDEN DIVIDED
INTO COMPARTMENTS AND THE HAUNTED RUINS OF VAUVERT THE EYE FELL TO
THE WEST UPON THE THREE ROMAN SPIRES OF SAINT GERMAIN DES PRS
THE
BOURG SAINT GERMAIN ALREADY A LARGE COMMUNITY FORMED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY
STREETS IN THE REAR THE POINTED BELL TOWER OF SAINT SULPICE MARKED
ONE CORNER OF THE TOWN
CLOSE BESIDE IT ONE DESCRIED THE QUADRILATERAL
ENCLOSURE OF THE FAIR OF SAINT GERMAIN WHERE THE MARKET IS SITUATED
TO DAY THEN THE ABBOT'S PILLORY A PRETTY LITTLE ROUND TOWER WELL
CAPPED WITH A LEADEN CONE THE BRICKYARD WAS FURTHER ON AND THE RUE DU
FOUR WHICH LED TO THE COMMON BAKEHOUSE AND THE MILL ON ITS HILLOCK
AND THE LAZAR HOUSE A TINY HOUSE ISOLATED AND HALF SEEN
BUT THAT WHICH ATTRACTED THE EYE MOST OF ALL AND FIXED IT FOR A LONG
TIME ON THAT POINT WAS THE ABBEY ITSELF
IT IS CERTAIN THAT THIS
MONASTERY WHICH HAD A GRAND AIR BOTH AS A CHURCH AND AS A SEIGNORY
THAT ABBATIAL PALACE WHERE THE BISHOPS OF PARIS COUNTED THEMSELVES
HAPPY IF THEY COULD PASS THE NIGHT THAT REFECTORY UPON WHICH THE
ARCHITECT HAD BESTOWED THE AIR THE BEAUTY AND THE ROSE WINDOW OF A
CATHEDRAL THAT ELEGANT CHAPEL OF THE VIRGIN THAT MONUMENTAL DORMITORY
THOSE VAST GARDENS THAT PORTCULLIS THAT DRAWBRIDGE THAT ENVELOPE
OF BATTLEMENTS WHICH NOTCHED TO THE EYE THE VERDURE OF THE SURROUNDING
MEADOWS THOSE COURTYARDS WHERE GLEAMED MEN AT ARMS INTERMINGLED WITH
GOLDEN COPES THE WHOLE GROUPED AND CLUSTERED ABOUT THREE LOFTY SPIRES
WITH ROUND ARCHES WELL PLANTED UPON A GOTHIC APSE MADE A MAGNIFICENT
FIGURE AGAINST THE HORIZON
WHEN AT LENGTH AFTER HAVING CONTEMPLATED THE UNIVERSITY FOR A LONG
TIME YOU TURNED TOWARDS THE RIGHT BANK TOWARDS THE TOWN THE CHARACTER
OF THE SPECTACLE WAS ABRUPTLY ALTERED
THE TOWN IN FACT MUCH LARGER
THAN THE UNIVERSITY WAS ALSO LESS OF A UNIT
AT THE FIRST GLANCE ONE
SAW THAT IT WAS DIVIDED INTO MANY MASSES SINGULARLY DISTINCT
FIRST TO
THE EASTWARD IN THAT PART OF THE TOWN WHICH STILL TAKES ITS NAME FROM
THE MARSH WHERE CAMULOGNES ENTANGLED CAESAR WAS A PILE OF PALACES
THE
BLOCK EXTENDED TO THE VERY WATER'S EDGE
FOUR ALMOST CONTIGUOUS HTELS
JOUY SENS BARBEAU THE HOUSE OF THE QUEEN MIRRORED THEIR SLATE PEAKS
BROKEN WITH SLENDER TURRETS IN THE SEINE
THESE FOUR EDIFICES FILLED THE SPACE FROM THE RUE DES NONAINDIRES TO
THE ABBEY OF THE CELESTINS WHOSE SPIRE GRACEFULLY RELIEVED THEIR LINE
OF GABLES AND BATTLEMENTS
A FEW MISERABLE GREENISH HOVELS HANGING
OVER THE WATER IN FRONT OF THESE SUMPTUOUS HTELS DID NOT PREVENT
ONE FROM SEEING THE FINE ANGLES OF THEIR FAADES THEIR LARGE SQUARE
WINDOWS WITH STONE MULLIONS THEIR POINTED PORCHES OVERLOADED WITH
STATUES THE VIVID OUTLINES OF THEIR WALLS ALWAYS CLEAR CUT AND ALL
THOSE CHARMING ACCIDENTS OF ARCHITECTURE WHICH CAUSE GOTHIC ART TO HAVE
THE AIR OF BEGINNING ITS COMBINATIONS AFRESH WITH EVERY MONUMENT
BEHIND THESE PALACES EXTENDED IN ALL DIRECTIONS NOW BROKEN FENCED IN
BATTLEMENTED LIKE A CITADEL NOW VEILED BY GREAT TREES LIKE A CARTHUSIAN
CONVENT THE IMMENSE AND MULTIFORM ENCLOSURE OF THAT MIRACULOUS HTEL
DE SAINT POL WHERE THE KING OF FRANCE POSSESSED THE MEANS OF LODGING
SUPERBLY TWO AND TWENTY PRINCES OF THE RANK OF THE DAUPHIN AND THE DUKE
OF BURGUNDY WITH THEIR DOMESTICS AND THEIR SUITES WITHOUT COUNTING THE
GREAT LORDS AND THE EMPEROR WHEN HE CAME TO VIEW PARIS AND THE LIONS
WHO HAD THEIR SEPARATE HTEL AT THE ROYAL HTEL
LET US SAY HERE THAT
A PRINCE'S APARTMENT WAS THEN COMPOSED OF NEVER LESS THAN ELEVEN LARGE
ROOMS FROM THE CHAMBER OF STATE TO THE ORATORY NOT TO MENTION THE
GALLERIES BATHS VAPOR BATHS AND OTHER SUPERFLUOUS PLACES WITH
WHICH EACH APARTMENT WAS PROVIDED NOT TO MENTION THE PRIVATE GARDENS
FOR EACH OF THE KING'S GUESTS NOT TO MENTION THE KITCHENS THE
CELLARS THE DOMESTIC OFFICES THE GENERAL REFECTORIES OF THE HOUSE THE
POULTRY YARDS WHERE THERE WERE TWENTY TWO GENERAL LABORATORIES FROM
THE BAKEHOUSES TO THE WINE CELLARS GAMES OF A THOUSAND SORTS MALLS
TENNIS AND RIDING AT THE RING AVIARIES FISHPONDS MENAGERIES
STABLES BARNS LIBRARIES ARSENALS AND FOUNDRIES
THIS WAS WHAT A
KING'S PALACE A LOUVRE A HTEL DE SAINT POL WAS THEN
A CITY WITHIN A
CITY
FROM THE TOWER WHERE WE ARE PLACED THE HTEL SAINT POL ALMOST HALF
HIDDEN BY THE FOUR GREAT HOUSES OF WHICH WE HAVE JUST SPOKEN WAS
STILL VERY CONSIDERABLE AND VERY MARVELLOUS TO SEE
ONE COULD THERE
DISTINGUISH VERY WELL THOUGH CLEVERLY UNITED WITH THE PRINCIPAL
BUILDING BY LONG GALLERIES DECKED WITH PAINTED GLASS AND SLENDER
COLUMNS THE THREE HTELS WHICH CHARLES V
HAD AMALGAMATED WITH HIS
PALACE THE HTEL DU PETIT MUCE WITH THE AIRY BALUSTRADE WHICH FORMED
A GRACEFUL BORDER TO ITS ROOF THE HTEL OF THE ABBE DE SAINT MAUR
HAVING THE VANITY OF A STRONGHOLD A GREAT TOWER MACHICOLATIONS
LOOPHOLES IRON GRATINGS AND OVER THE LARGE SAXON DOOR THE ARMORIAL
BEARINGS OF THE ABB BETWEEN THE TWO MORTISES OF THE DRAWBRIDGE THE
HTEL OF THE COMTE D' ETAMPES WHOSE DONJON KEEP RUINED AT ITS SUMMIT
WAS ROUNDED AND NOTCHED LIKE A COCK'S COMB HERE AND THERE THREE OR
FOUR ANCIENT OAKS FORMING A TUFT TOGETHER LIKE ENORMOUS CAULIFLOWERS
GAMBOLS OF SWANS IN THE CLEAR WATER OF THE FISHPONDS ALL IN FOLDS OF
LIGHT AND SHADE MANY COURTYARDS OF WHICH ONE BEHELD PICTURESQUE BITS
THE HTEL OF THE LIONS WITH ITS LOW POINTED ARCHES ON SHORT SAXON
PILLARS ITS IRON GRATINGS AND ITS PERPETUAL ROAR SHOOTING UP ABOVE
THE WHOLE THE SCALE ORNAMENTED SPIRE OF THE AVE MARIA ON THE LEFT THE
HOUSE OF THE PROVOST OF PARIS FLANKED BY FOUR SMALL TOWERS DELICATELY
GROOVED IN THE MIDDLE AT THE EXTREMITY THE HTEL SAINT POL PROPERLY
SPEAKING WITH ITS MULTIPLIED FAADES ITS SUCCESSIVE ENRICHMENTS FROM
THE TIME OF CHARLES V THE HYBRID EXCRESCENCES WITH WHICH THE FANCY OF
THE ARCHITECTS HAD LOADED IT DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES WITH ALL
THE APSES OF ITS CHAPELS ALL THE GABLES OF ITS GALLERIES A THOUSAND
WEATHERCOCKS FOR THE FOUR WINDS AND ITS TWO LOFTY CONTIGUOUS TOWERS
WHOSE CONICAL ROOF SURROUNDED BY BATTLEMENTS AT ITS BASE LOOKED LIKE
THOSE POINTED CAPS WHICH HAVE THEIR EDGES TURNED UP
CONTINUING TO MOUNT THE STORIES OF THIS AMPHITHEATRE OF PALACES SPREAD
OUT AFAR UPON THE GROUND AFTER CROSSING A DEEP RAVINE HOLLOWED OUT
OF THE ROOFS IN THE TOWN WHICH MARKED THE PASSAGE OF THE RUE
SAINT ANTOINE THE EYE REACHED THE HOUSE OF ANGOULME A VAST
CONSTRUCTION OF MANY EPOCHS WHERE THERE WERE PERFECTLY NEW AND VERY
WHITE PARTS WHICH MELTED NO BETTER INTO THE WHOLE THAN A RED PATCH ON A
BLUE DOUBLET
NEVERTHELESS THE REMARKABLY POINTED AND LOFTY ROOF OF THE
MODERN PALACE BRISTLING WITH CARVED EAVES COVERED WITH SHEETS OF LEAD
WHERE COILED A THOUSAND FANTASTIC ARABESQUES OF SPARKLING INCRUSTATIONS
OF GILDED BRONZE THAT ROOF SO CURIOUSLY DAMASCENED DARTED UPWARDS
GRACEFULLY FROM THE MIDST OF THE BROWN RUINS OF THE ANCIENT EDIFICE
WHOSE HUGE AND ANCIENT TOWERS ROUNDED BY AGE LIKE CASKS SINKING
TOGETHER WITH OLD AGE AND RENDING THEMSELVES FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
RESEMBLED GREAT BELLIES UNBUTTONED
BEHIND ROSE THE FOREST OF SPIRES OF
THE PALAIS DES TOURNELLES
NOT A VIEW IN THE WORLD EITHER AT CHAMBORD
OR AT THE ALHAMBRA IS MORE MAGIC MORE AERIAL MORE ENCHANTING THAN
THAT THICKET OF SPIRES TINY BELL TOWERS CHIMNEYS WEATHER VANES
WINDING STAIRCASES LANTERNS THROUGH WHICH THE DAYLIGHT MAKES ITS WAY
WHICH SEEM CUT OUT AT A BLOW PAVILIONS SPINDLE SHAPED TURRETS OR AS
THEY WERE THEN CALLED TOURNELLES ALL DIFFERING IN FORM IN HEIGHT
AND ATTITUDE
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED IT A GIGANTIC STONE CHESS BOARD
TO THE RIGHT OF THE TOURNELLES THAT TRUSS OF ENORMOUS TOWERS BLACK AS
INK RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER AND TIED AS IT WERE BY A CIRCULAR MOAT
THAT DONJON KEEP MUCH MORE PIERCED WITH LOOPHOLES THAN WITH WINDOWS
THAT DRAWBRIDGE ALWAYS RAISED THAT PORTCULLIS ALWAYS LOWERED IS
THE BASTILLE
THOSE SORTS OF BLACK BEAKS WHICH PROJECT FROM BETWEEN THE
BATTLEMENTS AND WHICH YOU TAKE FROM A DISTANCE TO BE CAVE SPOUTS ARE
CANNONS
BENEATH THEM AT THE FOOT OF THE FORMIDABLE EDIFICE BEHOLD THE PORTE
SAINTE ANTOINE BURIED BETWEEN ITS TWO TOWERS
BEYOND THE TOURNELLES AS FAR AS THE WALL OF CHARLES V SPREAD OUT
WITH RICH COMPARTMENTS OF VERDURE AND OF FLOWERS A VELVET CARPET OF
CULTIVATED LAND AND ROYAL PARKS IN THE MIDST OF WHICH ONE RECOGNIZED
BY ITS LABYRINTH OF TREES AND ALLEYS THE FAMOUS DAEDALUS GARDEN WHICH
LOUIS XI
HAD GIVEN TO COICTIER
THE DOCTOR'S OBSERVATORY ROSE ABOVE THE
LABYRINTH LIKE A GREAT ISOLATED COLUMN WITH A TINY HOUSE FOR A CAPITAL
TERRIBLE ASTROLOGIES TOOK PLACE IN THAT LABORATORY
THERE TO DAY IS THE PLACE ROYALE
AS WE HAVE JUST SAID THE QUARTER OF THE PALACE OF WHICH WE HAVE JUST
ENDEAVORED TO GIVE THE READER SOME IDEA BY INDICATING ONLY THE CHIEF
POINTS FILLED THE ANGLE WHICH CHARLES V 'S WALL MADE WITH THE SEINE ON
THE EAST
THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN WAS OCCUPIED BY A PILE OF HOUSES FOR
THE POPULACE
IT WAS THERE IN FACT THAT THE THREE BRIDGES DISGORGED
UPON THE RIGHT BANK AND BRIDGES LEAD TO THE BUILDING OF HOUSES RATHER
THAN PALACES
THAT CONGREGATION OF BOURGEOIS HABITATIONS PRESSED
TOGETHER LIKE THE CELLS IN A HIVE HAD A BEAUTY OF ITS OWN
IT IS WITH
THE ROOFS OF A CAPITAL AS WITH THE WAVES OF THE SEA THEY ARE GRAND
FIRST THE STREETS CROSSED AND ENTANGLED FORMING A HUNDRED AMUSING
FIGURES IN THE BLOCK AROUND THE MARKET PLACE IT WAS LIKE A STAR WITH A
THOUSAND RAYS
THE RUES SAINT DENIS AND SAINT MARTIN WITH THEIR INNUMERABLE
RAMIFICATIONS ROSE ONE AFTER THE OTHER LIKE TREES INTERTWINING THEIR
BRANCHES AND THEN THE TORTUOUS LINES THE RUES DE LA PLTRERIE DE LA
VERRERIE DE LA TIXERANDERIE ETC MEANDERED OVER ALL
THERE WERE ALSO
FINE EDIFICES WHICH PIERCED THE PETRIFIED UNDULATIONS OF THAT SEA OF
GABLES
AT THE HEAD OF THE PONT AUX CHANGEURS BEHIND WHICH ONE BEHELD
THE SEINE FOAMING BENEATH THE WHEELS OF THE PONT AUX MEUNIERS THERE WAS
THE CHALELET NO LONGER A ROMAN TOWER AS UNDER JULIAN THE APOSTATE BUT
A FEUDAL TOWER OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY AND OF A STONE SO HARD THAT
THE PICKAXE COULD NOT BREAK AWAY SO MUCH AS THE THICKNESS OF THE FIST
IN A SPACE OF THREE HOURS THERE WAS THE RICH SQUARE BELL TOWER OF
SAINT JACQUES DE LA BOUCHERIE WITH ITS ANGLES ALL FROTHING WITH
CARVINGS ALREADY ADMIRABLE ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT FINISHED IN THE
FIFTEENTH CENTURY
IT LACKED IN PARTICULAR THE FOUR MONSTERS WHICH
STILL PERCHED TO DAY ON THE CORNERS OF ITS ROOF HAVE THE AIR OF SO
MANY SPHINXES WHO ARE PROPOUNDING TO NEW PARIS THE RIDDLE OF THE ANCIENT
PARIS
RAULT THE SCULPTOR ONLY PLACED THEM IN POSITION IN 1526 AND
RECEIVED TWENTY FRANCS FOR HIS PAINS THERE WAS THE MAISON AUX PILIERS
THE PILLAR HOUSE OPENING UPON THAT PLACE DE GRVE OF WHICH WE HAVE
GIVEN THE READER SOME IDEA THERE WAS SAINT GERVAIS WHICH A FRONT IN
GOOD TASTE HAS SINCE SPOILED SAINT MRY WHOSE ANCIENT POINTED ARCHES
WERE STILL ALMOST ROUND ARCHES SAINT JEAN WHOSE MAGNIFICENT SPIRE WAS
PROVERBIAL THERE WERE TWENTY OTHER MONUMENTS WHICH DID NOT DISDAIN TO
BURY THEIR WONDERS IN THAT CHAOS OF BLACK DEEP NARROW STREETS
ADD
THE CROSSES OF CARVED STONE MORE LAVISHLY SCATTERED THROUGH THE
SQUARES THAN EVEN THE GIBBETS THE CEMETERY OF THE INNOCENTS WHOSE
ARCHITECTURAL WALL COULD BE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE ABOVE THE ROOFS THE
PILLORY OF THE MARKETS WHOSE TOP WAS VISIBLE BETWEEN TWO CHIMNEYS OF
THE RUE DE LA COSSONNERIE THE LADDER OF THE CROIX DU TRAHOIR IN ITS
SQUARE ALWAYS BLACK WITH PEOPLE THE CIRCULAR BUILDINGS OF THE WHEAT
MART THE FRAGMENTS OF PHILIP AUGUSTUS'S ANCIENT WALL WHICH COULD BE
MADE OUT HERE AND THERE DROWNED AMONG THE HOUSES ITS TOWERS GNAWED BY
IVY ITS GATES IN RUINS WITH CRUMBLING AND DEFORMED STRETCHES OF WALL
THE QUAY WITH ITS THOUSAND SHOPS AND ITS BLOODY KNACKER'S YARDS THE
SEINE ENCUMBERED WITH BOATS FROM THE PORT AU FOIN TO PORT L'EVQUE AND
YOU WILL HAVE A CONFUSED PICTURE OF WHAT THE CENTRAL TRAPEZIUM OF THE
TOWN WAS LIKE IN 1482
WITH THESE TWO QUARTERS ONE OF HTELS THE OTHER OF HOUSES THE THIRD
FEATURE OF ASPECT PRESENTED BY THE CITY WAS A LONG ZONE OF ABBEYS WHICH
BORDERED IT IN NEARLY THE WHOLE OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE FROM THE RISING TO
THE SETTING SUN AND BEHIND THE CIRCLE OF FORTIFICATIONS WHICH HEMMED
IN PARIS FORMED A SECOND INTERIOR ENCLOSURE OF CONVENTS AND CHAPELS
THUS IMMEDIATELY ADJOINING THE PARK DES TOURNELLES BETWEEN THE
RUE SAINT ANTOINE AND THE VIELLE RUE DU TEMPLE THERE STOOD
SAINTE CATHERINE WITH ITS IMMENSE CULTIVATED LANDS WHICH WERE
TERMINATED ONLY BY THE WALL OF PARIS
BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW RUE DU
TEMPLE THERE WAS THE TEMPLE A SINISTER GROUP OF TOWERS LOFTY ERECT
AND ISOLATED IN THE MIDDLE OF A VAST BATTLEMENTED ENCLOSURE
BETWEEN
THE RUE NEUVE DU TEMPLE AND THE RUE SAINT MARTIN THERE WAS THE ABBEY
OF SAINT MARTIN IN THE MIDST OF ITS GARDENS A SUPERB FORTIFIED CHURCH
WHOSE GIRDLE OF TOWERS WHOSE DIADEM OF BELL TOWERS YIELDED IN
FORCE AND SPLENDOR ONLY TO SAINT GERMAIN DES PRS
BETWEEN THE RUE
SAINT MARTIN AND THE RUE SAINT DENIS SPREAD THE ENCLOSURE OF THE
TRINIT
LASTLY BETWEEN THE RUE SAINT DENIS AND THE RUE MONTORGUEIL STOOD THE
FILLES DIEU
ON ONE SIDE THE ROTTING ROOFS AND UNPAVED ENCLOSURE OF THE
COUR DES MIRACLES COULD BE DESCRIED
IT WAS THE SOLE PROFANE RING WHICH
WAS LINKED TO THAT DEVOUT CHAIN OF CONVENTS
FINALLY THE FOURTH COMPARTMENT WHICH STRETCHED ITSELF OUT IN THE
AGGLOMERATION OF THE ROOFS ON THE RIGHT BANK AND WHICH OCCUPIED THE
WESTERN ANGLE OF THE ENCLOSURE AND THE BANKS OF THE RIVER DOWN STREAM
WAS A FRESH CLUSTER OF PALACES AND HTELS PRESSED CLOSE ABOUT THE BASE
OF THE LOUVRE
THE OLD LOUVRE OF PHILIP AUGUSTUS THAT IMMENSE EDIFICE
WHOSE GREAT TOWER RALLIED ABOUT IT THREE AND TWENTY CHIEF TOWERS NOT TO
RECKON THE LESSER TOWERS SEEMED FROM A DISTANCE TO BE ENSHRINED IN THE
GOTHIC ROOFS OF THE HTEL D'ALENON AND THE PETIT BOURBON
THIS HYDRA
OF TOWERS GIANT GUARDIAN OF PARIS WITH ITS FOUR AND TWENTY HEADS
ALWAYS ERECT WITH ITS MONSTROUS HAUNCHES LOADED OR SCALED WITH SLATES
AND ALL STREAMING WITH METALLIC REFLECTIONS TERMINATED WITH WONDERFUL
EFFECT THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TOWN TOWARDS THE WEST
THUS AN IMMENSE BLOCK WHICH THE ROMANS CALLED IUSULA OR ISLAND OF
BOURGEOIS HOUSES FLANKED ON THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT BY TWO BLOCKS OF
PALACES CROWNED THE ONE BY THE LOUVRE THE OTHER BY THE TOURNELLES
BORDERED ON THE NORTH BY A LONG GIRDLE OF ABBEYS AND CULTIVATED
ENCLOSURES ALL AMALGAMATED AND MELTED TOGETHER IN ONE VIEW UPON THESE
THOUSANDS OF EDIFICES WHOSE TILED AND SLATED ROOFS OUTLINED UPON EACH
OTHER SO MANY FANTASTIC CHAINS THE BELL TOWERS TATTOOED FLUTED AND
ORNAMENTED WITH TWISTED BANDS OF THE FOUR AND FORTY CHURCHES ON THE
RIGHT BANK MYRIADS OF CROSS STREETS FOR BOUNDARY ON ONE SIDE AN
ENCLOSURE OF LOFTY WALLS WITH SQUARE TOWERS THAT OF THE UNIVERSITY HAD
ROUND TOWERS ON THE OTHER THE SEINE CUT BY BRIDGES AND BEARING
ON ITS BOSOM A MULTITUDE OF BOATS BEHOLD THE TOWN OF PARIS IN THE
FIFTEENTH CENTURY
BEYOND THE WALLS SEVERAL SUBURBAN VILLAGES PRESSED CLOSE ABOUT
THE GATES BUT LESS NUMEROUS AND MORE SCATTERED THAN THOSE OF THE
UNIVERSITY
BEHIND THE BASTILLE THERE WERE TWENTY HOVELS CLUSTERED ROUND
THE CURIOUS SCULPTURES OF THE CROIX FAUBIN AND THE FLYING BUTTRESSES OF
THE ABBEY OF SAINT ANTOINE DES CHAMPS THEN POPINCOURT LOST AMID WHEAT
FIELDS THEN LA COURTILLE A MERRY VILLAGE OF WINE SHOPS THE HAMLET OF
SAINT LAURENT WITH ITS CHURCH WHOSE BELL TOWER FROM AFAR SEEMED TO
ADD ITSELF TO THE POINTED TOWERS OF THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN THE
FAUBOURG SAINT DENIS WITH THE VAST ENCLOSURE OF SAINT LADRE BEYOND
THE MONTMARTRE GATE THE GRANGE BATELIRE ENCIRCLED WITH WHITE WALLS
BEHIND IT WITH ITS CHALKY SLOPES MONTMARTRE WHICH HAD THEN ALMOST AS
MANY CHURCHES AS WINDMILLS AND WHICH HAS KEPT ONLY THE WINDMILLS
FOR SOCIETY NO LONGER DEMANDS ANYTHING BUT BREAD FOR THE BODY
LASTLY
BEYOND THE LOUVRE THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONOR ALREADY CONSIDERABLE
AT THAT TIME COULD BE SEEN STRETCHING AWAY INTO THE FIELDS AND
PETIT BRETAGNE GLEAMING GREEN AND THE MARCH AUX POURCEAUX SPREADING
ABROAD IN WHOSE CENTRE SWELLED THE HORRIBLE APPARATUS USED FOR BOILING
COUNTERFEITERS
BETWEEN LA COURTILLE AND SAINT LAURENT YOUR EYE HAD
ALREADY NOTICED ON THE SUMMIT OF AN EMINENCE CROUCHING AMID DESERT
PLAINS A SORT OF EDIFICE WHICH RESEMBLED FROM A DISTANCE A RUINED
COLONNADE MOUNTED UPON A BASEMENT WITH ITS FOUNDATION LAID BARE
THIS
WAS NEITHER A PARTHENON NOR A TEMPLE OF THE OLYMPIAN JUPITER
IT WAS
MONTFAUON
NOW IF THE ENUMERATION OF SO MANY EDIFICES SUMMARY AS WE HAVE
ENDEAVORED TO MAKE IT HAS NOT SHATTERED IN THE READER'S MIND THE
GENERAL IMAGE OF OLD PARIS AS WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED IT WE WILL
RECAPITULATE IT IN A FEW WORDS
IN THE CENTRE THE ISLAND OF THE CITY
RESEMBLING AS TO FORM AN ENORMOUS TORTOISE AND THROWING OUT ITS BRIDGES
WITH TILES FOR SCALES LIKE LEGS FROM BENEATH ITS GRAY SHELL OF ROOFS
ON THE LEFT THE MONOLITHIC TRAPEZIUM FIRM DENSE BRISTLING OF THE
UNIVERSITY ON THE RIGHT THE VAST SEMICIRCLE OF THE TOWN MUCH
MORE INTERMIXED WITH GARDENS AND MONUMENTS
THE THREE BLOCKS CITY
UNIVERSITY AND TOWN MARBLED WITH INNUMERABLE STREETS
ACROSS ALL
THE SEINE FOSTER MOTHER SEINE AS SAYS FATHER DU BREUL BLOCKED WITH
ISLANDS BRIDGES AND BOATS
ALL ABOUT AN IMMENSE PLAIN PATCHED WITH
A THOUSAND SORTS OF CULTIVATED PLOTS SOWN WITH FINE VILLAGES
ON THE
LEFT ISSY VANVRES VAUGIRARDE MONTROUGE GENTILLY WITH ITS ROUND
TOWER AND ITS SQUARE TOWER ETC ON THE RIGHT TWENTY OTHERS FROM
CONFLANS TO VILLE L'EVQUE
ON THE HORIZON A BORDER OF HILLS ARRANGED
IN A CIRCLE LIKE THE RIM OF THE BASIN
FINALLY FAR AWAY TO THE EAST
VINCENNES AND ITS SEVEN QUADRANGULAR TOWERS TO THE SOUTH BICTRE AND
ITS POINTED TURRETS TO THE NORTH SAINT DENIS AND ITS SPIRE TO THE
WEST SAINT CLOUD AND ITS DONJON KEEP
SUCH WAS THE PARIS WHICH THE
RAVENS WHO LIVED IN 1482 BEHELD FROM THE SUMMITS OF THE TOWERS OF
NOTRE DAME
NEVERTHELESS VOLTAIRE SAID OF THIS CITY THAT BEFORE LOUIS XIV
IT POSSESSED BUT FOUR FINE MONUMENTS THE DOME OF THE SORBONNE THE
VAL DE GRCE THE MODERN LOUVRE AND I KNOW NOT WHAT THE FOURTH WAS THE
LUXEMBOURG PERHAPS
FORTUNATELY VOLTAIRE WAS THE AUTHOR OF CANDIDE
IN SPITE OF THIS AND IN SPITE OF THIS HE IS AMONG ALL THE MEN WHO
HAVE FOLLOWED EACH OTHER IN THE LONG SERIES OF HUMANITY THE ONE WHO HAS
BEST POSSESSED THE DIABOLICAL LAUGH
MOREOVER THIS PROVES THAT ONE CAN
BE A FINE GENIUS AND YET UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF AN ART TO WHICH ONE
DOES NOT BELONG
DID NOT MOLIERE IMAGINE THAT HE WAS DOING RAPHAEL AND
MICHAEL ANGELO A VERY GREAT HONOR BY CALLING THEM THOSE MIGNARDS OF
THEIR AGE
LET US RETURN TO PARIS AND TO THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
IT WAS NOT THEN MERELY A HANDSOME CITY IT WAS A HOMOGENEOUS CITY AN
ARCHITECTURAL AND HISTORICAL PRODUCT OF THE MIDDLE AGES A CHRONICLE IN
STONE
IT WAS A CITY FORMED OF TWO LAYERS ONLY THE ROMANESQUE LAYER AND
THE GOTHIC LAYER FOR THE ROMAN LAYER HAD DISAPPEARED LONG BEFORE WITH
THE EXCEPTION OF THE HOT BATHS OF JULIAN WHERE IT STILL PIERCED
THROUGH THE THICK CRUST OF THE MIDDLE AGES
AS FOR THE CELTIC LAYER NO
SPECIMENS WERE ANY LONGER TO BE FOUND EVEN WHEN SINKING WELLS
FIFTY YEARS LATER WHEN THE RENAISSANCE BEGAN TO MINGLE WITH THIS
UNITY WHICH WAS SO SEVERE AND YET SO VARIED THE DAZZLING LUXURY OF
ITS FANTASIES AND SYSTEMS ITS DEBASEMENTS OF ROMAN ROUND ARCHES GREEK
COLUMNS AND GOTHIC BASES ITS SCULPTURE WHICH WAS SO TENDER AND SO
IDEAL ITS PECULIAR TASTE FOR ARABESQUES AND ACANTHUS LEAVES ITS
ARCHITECTURAL PAGANISM CONTEMPORARY WITH LUTHER PARIS WAS PERHAPS
STILL MORE BEAUTIFUL ALTHOUGH LESS HARMONIOUS TO THE EYE AND TO THE
THOUGHT
BUT THIS SPLENDID MOMENT LASTED ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME THE RENAISSANCE
WAS NOT IMPARTIAL IT DID NOT CONTENT ITSELF WITH BUILDING IT WISHED
TO DESTROY IT IS TRUE THAT IT REQUIRED THE ROOM
THUS GOTHIC PARIS WAS
COMPLETE ONLY FOR A MOMENT
SAINT JACQUES DE LA BOUCHERIE HAD BARELY
BEEN COMPLETED WHEN THE DEMOLITION OF THE OLD LOUVRE WAS BEGUN
AFTER THAT THE GREAT CITY BECAME MORE DISFIGURED EVERY DAY
GOTHIC
PARIS BENEATH WHICH ROMAN PARIS WAS EFFACED WAS EFFACED IN ITS TURN
BUT CAN ANY ONE SAY WHAT PARIS HAS REPLACED IT
THERE IS THE PARIS OF CATHERINE DE MEDICIS AT THE TUILERIES THE
PARIS OF HENRI II AT THE HTEL DE VILLE TWO EDIFICES STILL IN FINE
TASTE THE PARIS OF HENRI IV AT THE PLACE ROYALE FAADES OF BRICK
WITH STONE CORNERS AND SLATED ROOFS TRI COLORED HOUSES THE PARIS OF
LOUIS XIII AT THE VAL DE GRACE A CRUSHED AND SQUAT ARCHITECTURE WITH
VAULTS LIKE BASKET HANDLES AND SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY POT BELLIED IN
THE COLUMN AND THICKSET IN THE DOME THE PARIS OF LOUIS XIV IN
THE INVALIDES GRAND RICH GILDED COLD THE PARIS OF LOUIS XV IN
SAINT SULPICE VOLUTES KNOTS OF RIBBON CLOUDS VERMICELLI AND CHICCORY
LEAVES ALL IN STONE THE PARIS OF LOUIS XVI IN THE PANTHEON SAINT
PETER OF ROME BADLY COPIED THE EDIFICE IS AWKWARDLY HEAPED TOGETHER
WHICH HAS NOT AMENDED ITS LINES THE PARIS OF THE REPUBLIC IN THE
SCHOOL OF MEDICINE A POOR GREEK AND ROMAN TASTE WHICH RESEMBLES
THE COLISEUM OR THE PARTHENON AS THE CONSTITUTION OF THE YEAR III
RESEMBLES THE LAWS OF MINOS IT IS CALLED IN ARCHITECTURE THE
MESSIDOR TASTE THE PARIS OF NAPOLEON IN THE PLACE VENDOME THIS
ONE IS SUBLIME A COLUMN OF BRONZE MADE OF CANNONS THE PARIS OF THE
RESTORATION AT THE BOURSE A VERY WHITE COLONNADE SUPPORTING A VERY
SMOOTH FRIEZE THE WHOLE IS SQUARE AND COST TWENTY MILLIONS
WE HAVE SEEN WITH SORROW MINGLED WITH INDIGNATION THAT IT
IS THE INTENTION TO INCREASE TO RECAST TO MAKE OVER THAT IS TO SAY
TO DESTROY THIS ADMIRABLE PALACE
THE ARCHITECTS OF OUR DAY HAVE TOO
HEAVY A HAND TO TOUCH THESE DELICATE WORKS OF THE RENAISSANCE
WE STILL
CHERISH A HOPE THAT THEY WILL NOT DARE
MOREOVER THIS DEMOLITION OF THE
TUILERIES NOW WOULD BE NOT ONLY A BRUTAL DEED OF VIOLENCE WHICH
WOULD MAKE A DRUNKEN VANDAL BLUSH IT WOULD BE AN ACT OF TREASON
THE TUILERIES IS NOT SIMPLY A MASTERPIECE OF THE ART OF THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY IT IS A PAGE OF THE HISTORY OF THE NINETEENTH
THIS PALACE NO
LONGER BELONGS TO THE KING BUT TO THE PEOPLE
LET US LEAVE IT AS IT IS
OUR REVOLUTION HAS TWICE SET ITS SEAL UPON ITS FRONT
ON ONE OF ITS TWO
FAADES THERE ARE THE CANNON BALLS OF THE 10TH OF AUGUST ON THE OTHER
THE BALLS OF THE 29TH OF JULY
IT IS SACRED
PARIS APRIL 1 1831
NOTE
TO THE FIFTH EDITION
THE TENTH MONTH OF THE FRENCH REPUBLICAN CALENDAR FROM THE
19TH OF JUNE TO THE 18TH OF JULY
TO EACH OF THESE CHARACTERISTIC MONUMENTS THERE IS ATTACHED BY A
SIMILARITY OF TASTE FASHION AND ATTITUDE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF
HOUSES SCATTERED ABOUT IN DIFFERENT QUARTERS AND WHICH THE EYES OF THE
CONNOISSEUR EASILY DISTINGUISHES AND FURNISHES WITH A DATE
WHEN
ONE KNOWS HOW TO LOOK ONE FINDS THE SPIRIT OF A CENTURY AND THE
PHYSIOGNOMY OF A KING EVEN IN THE KNOCKER ON A DOOR
THE PARIS OF THE PRESENT DAY HAS THEN NO GENERAL PHYSIOGNOMY
IT IS
A COLLECTION OF SPECIMENS OF MANY CENTURIES AND THE FINEST HAVE
DISAPPEARED
THE CAPITAL GROWS ONLY IN HOUSES AND WHAT HOUSES AT THE
RATE AT WHICH PARIS IS NOW PROCEEDING IT WILL RENEW ITSELF EVERY FIFTY
YEARS
THUS THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ITS ARCHITECTURE IS BEING EFFACED
EVERY DAY
MONUMENTS ARE BECOMING RARER AND RARER AND ONE SEEMS TO SEE
THEM GRADUALLY ENGULFED BY THE FLOOD OF HOUSES
OUR FATHERS HAD A PARIS
OF STONE OUR SONS WILL HAVE ONE OF PLASTER
SO FAR AS THE MODERN MONUMENTS OF NEW PARIS ARE CONCERNED WE WOULD
GLADLY BE EXCUSED FROM MENTIONING THEM
IT IS NOT THAT WE DO NOT ADMIRE
THEM AS THEY DESERVE
THE SAINTE GENEVIVE OF M
SOUFFLOT IS CERTAINLY
THE FINEST SAVOY CAKE THAT HAS EVER BEEN MADE IN STONE
THE PALACE OF
THE LEGION OF HONOR IS ALSO A VERY DISTINGUISHED BIT OF PASTRY
THE
DOME OF THE WHEAT MARKET IS AN ENGLISH JOCKEY CAP ON A GRAND SCALE
THE
TOWERS OF SAINT SULPICE ARE TWO HUGE CLARINETS AND THE FORM IS AS GOOD
AS ANY OTHER THE TELEGRAPH CONTORTED AND GRIMACING FORMS AN
ADMIRABLE ACCIDENT UPON THEIR ROOFS
SAINT ROCH HAS A DOOR WHICH FOR
MAGNIFICENCE IS COMPARABLE ONLY TO THAT OF SAINT THOMAS D'AQUIN
IT
HAS ALSO A CRUCIFIXION IN HIGH RELIEF IN A CELLAR WITH A SUN OF
GILDED WOOD
THESE THINGS ARE FAIRLY MARVELLOUS
THE LANTERN OF THE
LABYRINTH OF THE JARDIN DES PLANTES IS ALSO VERY INGENIOUS
AS FOR THE PALACE OF THE BOURSE WHICH IS GREEK AS TO ITS COLONNADE
ROMAN IN THE ROUND ARCHES OF ITS DOORS AND WINDOWS OF THE RENAISSANCE
BY VIRTUE OF ITS FLATTENED VAULT IT IS INDUBITABLY A VERY CORRECT AND
VERY PURE MONUMENT THE PROOF IS THAT IT IS CROWNED WITH AN ATTIC SUCH
AS WAS NEVER SEEN IN ATHENS A BEAUTIFUL STRAIGHT LINE GRACEFULLY
BROKEN HERE AND THERE BY STOVEPIPES
LET US ADD THAT IF IT IS ACCORDING
TO RULE THAT THE ARCHITECTURE OF A BUILDING SHOULD BE ADAPTED TO ITS
PURPOSE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THIS PURPOSE SHALL BE IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
FROM THE MERE ASPECT OF THE BUILDING ONE CANNOT BE TOO MUCH AMAZED AT A
STRUCTURE WHICH MIGHT BE INDIFFERENTLY THE PALACE OF A KING A CHAMBER
OF COMMUNES A TOWN HALL A COLLEGE A RIDING SCHOOL AN ACADEMY A
WAREHOUSE A COURT HOUSE A MUSEUM A BARRACKS A SEPULCHRE A TEMPLE
OR A THEATRE
HOWEVER IT IS AN EXCHANGE
AN EDIFICE OUGHT TO BE
MOREOVER SUITABLE TO THE CLIMATE
THIS ONE IS EVIDENTLY CONSTRUCTED
EXPRESSLY FOR OUR COLD AND RAINY SKIES
IT HAS A ROOF ALMOST AS FLAT AS
ROOFS IN THE EAST WHICH INVOLVES SWEEPING THE ROOF IN WINTER WHEN IT
SNOWS AND OF COURSE ROOFS ARE MADE TO BE SWEPT
AS FOR ITS PURPOSE OF
WHICH WE JUST SPOKE IT FULFILS IT TO A MARVEL IT IS A BOURSE IN FRANCE
AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TEMPLE IN GREECE
IT IS TRUE THAT THE ARCHITECT
WAS AT A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE TO CONCEAL THE CLOCK FACE WHICH WOULD
HAVE DESTROYED THE PURITY OF THE FINE LINES OF THE FAADE BUT ON THE
OTHER HAND WE HAVE THAT COLONNADE WHICH CIRCLES ROUND THE EDIFICE AND
UNDER WHICH ON DAYS OF HIGH RELIGIOUS CEREMONY THE THEORIES OF
THE STOCK BROKERS AND THE COURTIERS OF COMMERCE CAN BE DEVELOPED SO
MAJESTICALLY
THESE ARE VERY SUPERB STRUCTURES
LET US ADD A QUANTITY OF FINE
AMUSING AND VARIED STREETS LIKE THE RUE DE RIVOLI AND I DO NOT
DESPAIR OF PARIS PRESENTING TO THE EYE WHEN VIEWED FROM A BALLOON THAT
RICHNESS OF LINE THAT OPULENCE OF DETAIL THAT DIVERSITY OF ASPECT
THAT GRANDIOSE SOMETHING IN THE SIMPLE AND UNEXPECTED IN THE BEAUTIFUL
WHICH CHARACTERIZES A CHECKER BOARD
HOWEVER ADMIRABLE AS THE PARIS OF TO DAY MAY SEEM TO YOU RECONSTRUCT
THE PARIS OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY CALL IT UP BEFORE YOU IN THOUGHT
LOOK AT THE SKY ATHWART THAT SURPRISING FOREST OF SPIRES TOWERS AND
BELFRIES SPREAD OUT IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY TEAR AWAY AT THE POINT
OF THE ISLANDS FOLD AT THE ARCHES OF THE BRIDGES THE SEINE WITH
ITS BROAD GREEN AND YELLOW EXPANSES MORE VARIABLE THAN THE SKIN OF A
SERPENT PROJECT CLEARLY AGAINST AN AZURE HORIZON THE GOTHIC PROFILE
OF THIS ANCIENT PARIS
MAKE ITS CONTOUR FLOAT IN A WINTER'S MIST WHICH
CLINGS TO ITS NUMEROUS CHIMNEYS DROWN IT IN PROFOUND NIGHT AND WATCH
THE ODD PLAY OF LIGHTS AND SHADOWS IN THAT SOMBRE LABYRINTH OF EDIFICES
CAST UPON IT A RAY OF LIGHT WHICH SHALL VAGUELY OUTLINE IT AND CAUSE TO
EMERGE FROM THE FOG THE GREAT HEADS OF THE TOWERS OR TAKE THAT BLACK
SILHOUETTE AGAIN ENLIVEN WITH SHADOW THE THOUSAND ACUTE ANGLES OF THE
SPIRES AND GABLES AND MAKE IT START OUT MORE TOOTHED THAN A SHARK'S JAW
AGAINST A COPPER COLORED WESTERN SKY AND THEN COMPARE
AND IF YOU WISH TO RECEIVE OF THE ANCIENT CITY AN IMPRESSION WITH WHICH
THE MODERN ONE CAN NO LONGER FURNISH YOU CLIMB ON THE MORNING OF SOME
GRAND FESTIVAL BENEATH THE RISING SUN OF EASTER OR OF PENTECOST CLIMB
UPON SOME ELEVATED POINT WHENCE YOU COMMAND THE ENTIRE CAPITAL AND BE
PRESENT AT THE WAKENING OF THE CHIMES
BEHOLD AT A SIGNAL GIVEN FROM
HEAVEN FOR IT IS THE SUN WHICH GIVES IT ALL THOSE CHURCHES QUIVER
SIMULTANEOUSLY
FIRST COME SCATTERED STROKES RUNNING FROM ONE CHURCH
TO ANOTHER AS WHEN MUSICIANS GIVE WARNING THAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN
THEN ALL AT ONCE BEHOLD FOR IT SEEMS AT TIMES AS THOUGH THE EAR
ALSO POSSESSED A SIGHT OF ITS OWN BEHOLD RISING FROM EACH BELL
TOWER SOMETHING LIKE A COLUMN OF SOUND A CLOUD OF HARMONY
FIRST THE
VIBRATION OF EACH BELL MOUNTS STRAIGHT UPWARDS PURE AND SO TO SPEAK
ISOLATED FROM THE OTHERS INTO THE SPLENDID MORNING SKY THEN LITTLE
BY LITTLE AS THEY SWELL THEY MELT TOGETHER MINGLE ARE LOST IN EACH
OTHER AND AMALGAMATE IN A MAGNIFICENT CONCERT
IT IS NO LONGER ANYTHING
BUT A MASS OF SONOROUS VIBRATIONS INCESSANTLY SENT FORTH FROM THE
NUMEROUS BELFRIES FLOATS UNDULATES BOUNDS WHIRLS OVER THE CITY
AND PROLONGS FAR BEYOND THE HORIZON THE DEAFENING CIRCLE OF ITS
OSCILLATIONS
NEVERTHELESS THIS SEA OF HARMONY IS NOT A CHAOS GREAT AND PROFOUND AS
IT IS IT HAS NOT LOST ITS TRANSPARENCY YOU BEHOLD THE WINDINGS OF
EACH GROUP OF NOTES WHICH ESCAPES FROM THE BELFRIES
YOU CAN FOLLOW THE
DIALOGUE BY TURNS GRAVE AND SHRILL OF THE TREBLE AND THE BASS YOU CAN
SEE THE OCTAVES LEAP FROM ONE TOWER TO ANOTHER YOU WATCH THEM SPRING
FORTH WINGED LIGHT AND WHISTLING FROM THE SILVER BELL TO FALL
BROKEN AND LIMPING FROM THE BELL OF WOOD YOU ADMIRE IN THEIR MIDST THE
RICH GAMUT WHICH INCESSANTLY ASCENDS AND RE ASCENDS THE SEVEN BELLS
OF SAINT EUSTACHE YOU SEE LIGHT AND RAPID NOTES RUNNING ACROSS IT
EXECUTING THREE OR FOUR LUMINOUS ZIGZAGS AND VANISHING LIKE FLASHES
OF LIGHTNING
YONDER IS THE ABBEY OF SAINT MARTIN A SHRILL CRACKED
SINGER HERE THE GRUFF AND GLOOMY VOICE OF THE BASTILLE AT THE OTHER
END THE GREAT TOWER OF THE LOUVRE WITH ITS BASS
THE ROYAL CHIME OF
THE PALACE SCATTERS ON ALL SIDES AND WITHOUT RELAXATION RESPLENDENT
TRILLS UPON WHICH FALL AT REGULAR INTERVALS THE HEAVY STROKES FROM
THE BELFRY OF NOTRE DAME WHICH MAKES THEM SPARKLE LIKE THE ANVIL UNDER
THE HAMMER
AT INTERVALS YOU BEHOLD THE PASSAGE OF SOUNDS OF ALL FORMS
WHICH COME FROM THE TRIPLE PEAL OF SAINT GERMAINE DES PRS
THEN AGAIN
FROM TIME TO TIME THIS MASS OF SUBLIME NOISES OPENS AND GIVES PASSAGE
TO THE BEATS OF THE AVE MARIA WHICH BURSTS FORTH AND SPARKLES LIKE
AN AIGRETTE OF STARS
BELOW IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF THE CONCERT YOU
CONFUSEDLY DISTINGUISH THE INTERIOR CHANTING OF THE CHURCHES WHICH
EXHALES THROUGH THE VIBRATING PORES OF THEIR VAULTED ROOFS
ASSUREDLY THIS IS AN OPERA WHICH IT IS WORTH THE TROUBLE OF LISTENING
TO
ORDINARILY THE NOISE WHICH ESCAPES FROM PARIS BY DAY IS THE CITY
SPEAKING BY NIGHT IT IS THE CITY BREATHING IN THIS CASE IT IS THE
CITY SINGING
LEND AN EAR THEN TO THIS CONCERT OF BELL TOWERS SPREAD
OVER ALL THE MURMUR OF HALF A MILLION MEN THE ETERNAL PLAINT OF THE
RIVER THE INFINITE BREATHINGS OF THE WIND THE GRAVE AND DISTANT
QUARTETTE OF THE FOUR FORESTS ARRANGED UPON THE HILLS ON THE HORIZON
LIKE IMMENSE STACKS OF ORGAN PIPES EXTINGUISH AS IN A HALF SHADE
ALL THAT IS TOO HOARSE AND TOO SHRILL ABOUT THE CENTRAL CHIME AND
SAY WHETHER YOU KNOW ANYTHING IN THE WORLD MORE RICH AND JOYFUL MORE
GOLDEN MORE DAZZLING THAN THIS TUMULT OF BELLS AND CHIMES THAN
THIS FURNACE OF MUSIC THAN THESE TEN THOUSAND BRAZEN VOICES CHANTING
SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE FLUTES OF STONE THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH THAN
THIS CITY WHICH IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT AN ORCHESTRA THAN THIS
SYMPHONY WHICH PRODUCES THE NOISE OF A TEMPEST
BOOK FOURTH
CHAPTER I
GOOD SOULS
SIXTEEN YEARS PREVIOUS TO THE EPOCH WHEN THIS STORY TAKES PLACE ONE
FINE MORNING ON QUASIMODO SUNDAY A LIVING CREATURE HAD BEEN DEPOSITED
AFTER MASS IN THE CHURCH OF NOTRE DAME ON THE WOODEN BED SECURELY
FIXED IN THE VESTIBULE ON THE LEFT OPPOSITE THAT GREAT IMAGE OF SAINT
CHRISTOPHER WHICH THE FIGURE OF MESSIRE ANTOINE DES ESSARTS CHEVALIER
CARVED IN STONE HAD BEEN GAZING AT ON HIS KNEES SINCE 1413 WHEN
THEY TOOK IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO OVERTHROW THE SAINT AND THE FAITHFUL
FOLLOWER
UPON THIS BED OF WOOD IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO EXPOSE FOUNDLINGS
FOR PUBLIC CHARITY
WHOEVER CARED TO TAKE THEM DID SO
IN FRONT OF THE
WOODEN BED WAS A COPPER BASIN FOR ALMS
THE SORT OF LIVING BEING WHICH LAY UPON THAT PLANK ON THE MORNING OF
QUASIMODO IN THE YEAR OF THE LORD 1467 APPEARED TO EXCITE TO A HIGH
DEGREE THE CURIOSITY OF THE NUMEROUS GROUP WHICH HAD CONGREGATED ABOUT
THE WOODEN BED
THE GROUP WAS FORMED FOR THE MOST PART OF THE FAIR SEX
HARDLY ANY ONE WAS THERE EXCEPT OLD WOMEN
IN THE FIRST ROW AND AMONG THOSE WHO WERE MOST BENT OVER THE BED FOUR
WERE NOTICEABLE WHO FROM THEIR GRAY CAGOULE A SORT OF CASSOCK WERE
RECOGNIZABLE AS ATTACHED TO SOME DEVOUT SISTERHOOD
I DO NOT SEE
WHY HISTORY HAS NOT TRANSMITTED TO POSTERITY THE NAMES OF THESE FOUR
DISCREET AND VENERABLE DAMSELS
THEY WERE AGNES LA HERME JEHANNE DE LA
TARME HENRIETTE LA GAULTIRE GAUCHRE LA VIOLETTE ALL FOUR WIDOWS
ALL FOUR DAMES OF THE CHAPEL ETIENNE HAUDRY WHO HAD QUITTED THEIR
HOUSE WITH THE PERMISSION OF THEIR MISTRESS AND IN CONFORMITY WITH THE
STATUTES OF PIERRE D'AILLY IN ORDER TO COME AND HEAR THE SERMON
HOWEVER IF THESE GOOD HAUDRIETTES WERE FOR THE MOMENT COMPLYING WITH
THE STATUTES OF PIERRE D'AILLY THEY CERTAINLY VIOLATED WITH JOY THOSE
OF MICHEL DE BRACHE AND THE CARDINAL OF PISA WHICH SO INHUMANLY
ENJOINED SILENCE UPON THEM
WHAT IS THIS SISTER SAID AGNES TO GAUCHRE GAZING AT THE LITTLE
CREATURE EXPOSED WHICH WAS SCREAMING AND WRITHING ON THE WOODEN BED
TERRIFIED BY SO MANY GLANCES
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US SAID JEHANNE IF THAT IS THE WAY CHILDREN
ARE MADE NOW
I'M NOT LEARNED IN THE MATTER OF CHILDREN RESUMED AGNES BUT IT MUST
BE A SIN TO LOOK AT THIS ONE
'TIS NOT A CHILD AGNES
'TIS AN ABORTION OF A MONKEY REMARKED GAUCHRE
'TIS A MIRACLE INTERPOSED HENRIETTE LA GAULTIRE
THEN REMARKED AGNES IT IS THE THIRD SINCE THE SUNDAY OF THE
LOETARE FOR IN LESS THAN A WEEK WE HAD THE MIRACLE OF THE MOCKER OF
PILGRIMS DIVINELY PUNISHED BY NOTRE DAME D'AUBERVILLIERS AND THAT WAS
THE SECOND MIRACLE WITHIN A MONTH
THIS PRETENDED FOUNDLING IS A REAL MONSTER OF ABOMINATION RESUMED
JEHANNE
HE YELLS LOUD ENOUGH TO DEAFEN A CHANTER CONTINUED GAUCHRE
HOLD
YOUR TONGUE YOU LITTLE HOWLER
TO THINK THAT MONSIEUR OF REIMS SENT THIS ENORMITY TO MONSIEUR OF
PARIS ADDED LA GAULTIRE CLASPING HER HANDS
I IMAGINE SAID AGNES LA HERME THAT IT IS A BEAST AN ANIMAL THE
FRUIT OF A JEW AND A SOW SOMETHING NOT CHRISTIAN IN SHORT WHICH
OUGHT TO BE THROWN INTO THE FIRE OR INTO THE WATER
I REALLY HOPE RESUMED LA GAULTIRE THAT NOBODY WILL APPLY FOR IT
AH GOOD HEAVENS EXCLAIMED AGNES THOSE POOR NURSES YONDER IN THE
FOUNDLING ASYLUM WHICH FORMS THE LOWER END OF THE LANE AS YOU GO TO THE
RIVER JUST BESIDE MONSEIGNEUR THE BISHOP WHAT IF THIS LITTLE MONSTER
WERE TO BE CARRIED TO THEM TO SUCKLE I'D RATHER GIVE SUCK TO A
VAMPIRE
HOW INNOCENT THAT POOR LA HERME IS RESUMED JEHANNE DON'T YOU SEE
SISTER THAT THIS LITTLE MONSTER IS AT LEAST FOUR YEARS OLD AND THAT HE
WOULD HAVE LESS APPETITE FOR YOUR BREAST THAN FOR A TURNSPIT
THE LITTLE MONSTER WE SHOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT OURSELVES TO DESCRIBE
HIM OTHERWISE WAS IN FACT NOT A NEW BORN CHILD
IT WAS A VERY ANGULAR
AND VERY LIVELY LITTLE MASS IMPRISONED IN ITS LINEN SACK STAMPED WITH
THE CIPHER OF MESSIRE GUILLAUME CHARTIER THEN BISHOP OF PARIS WITH A
HEAD PROJECTING
THAT HEAD WAS DEFORMED ENOUGH ONE BEHELD ONLY A FOREST
OF RED HAIR ONE EYE A MOUTH AND TEETH
THE EYE WEPT THE MOUTH
CRIED AND THE TEETH SEEMED TO ASK ONLY TO BE ALLOWED TO BITE
THE WHOLE
STRUGGLED IN THE SACK TO THE GREAT CONSTERNATION OF THE CROWD WHICH
INCREASED AND WAS RENEWED INCESSANTLY AROUND IT
DAME ALOISE DE GONDELAURIER A RICH AND NOBLE WOMAN WHO HELD BY THE
HAND A PRETTY GIRL ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS OF AGE AND DRAGGED A LONG
VEIL ABOUT SUSPENDED TO THE GOLDEN HORN OF HER HEADDRESS HALTED AS SHE
PASSED THE WOODEN BED AND GAZED FOR A MOMENT AT THE WRETCHED CREATURE
WHILE HER CHARMING LITTLE DAUGHTER FLEUR DE LYS DE GONDELAURIER
SPELLED OUT WITH HER TINY PRETTY FINGER THE PERMANENT INSCRIPTION
ATTACHED TO THE WOODEN BED FOUNDLINGS
REALLY SAID THE DAME TURNING AWAY IN DISGUST I THOUGHT THAT THEY
ONLY EXPOSED CHILDREN HERE
SHE TURNED HER BACK THROWING INTO THE BASIN A SILVER FLORIN WHICH RANG
AMONG THE LIARDS AND MADE THE POOR GOODWIVES OF THE CHAPEL OF ETIENNE
HAUDRY OPEN THEIR EYES
A MOMENT LATER THE GRAVE AND LEARNED ROBERT MISTRICOLLE THE KING'S
PROTONOTARY PASSED WITH AN ENORMOUS MISSAL UNDER ONE ARM AND HIS WIFE
ON THE OTHER DAMOISELLE GUILLEMETTE LA MAIRESSE HAVING THUS BY HIS
SIDE HIS TWO REGULATORS SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL
FOUNDLING HE SAID AFTER EXAMINING THE OBJECT FOUND APPARENTLY ON
THE BANKS OF THE RIVER PHLEGETHON
ONE CAN ONLY SEE ONE EYE OBSERVED DAMOISELLE GUILLEMETTE THERE IS A
WART ON THE OTHER
IT'S NOT A WART RETURNED MASTER ROBERT MISTRICOLLE IT IS AN EGG
WHICH CONTAINS ANOTHER DEMON EXACTLY SIMILAR WHO BEARS ANOTHER LITTLE
EGG WHICH CONTAINS ANOTHER DEVIL AND SO ON
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT ASKED GUILLEMETTE LA MAIRESSE
I KNOW IT PERTINENTLY REPLIED THE PROTONOTARY
MONSIEUR LE PROTONOTARE ASKED GAUCHRE WHAT DO YOU PROGNOSTICATE OF
THIS PRETENDED FOUNDLING
THE GREATEST MISFORTUNES REPLIED MISTRICOLLE
AH GOOD HEAVENS SAID AN OLD WOMAN AMONG THE SPECTATORS AND THAT
BESIDES OUR HAVING HAD A CONSIDERABLE PESTILENCE LAST YEAR AND THAT
THEY SAY THAT THE ENGLISH ARE GOING TO DISEMBARK IN A COMPANY AT
HARFLEUR
PERHAPS THAT WILL PREVENT THE QUEEN FROM COMING TO PARIS IN THE MONTH
OF SEPTEMBER INTERPOSED ANOTHER TRADE IS SO BAD ALREADY
MY OPINION IS EXCLAIMED JEHANNE DE LA TARME THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER
FOR THE LOUTS OF PARIS IF THIS LITTLE MAGICIAN WERE PUT TO BED ON A
FAGOT THAN ON A PLANK
A FINE FLAMING FAGOT ADDED THE OLD WOMAN
IT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT SAID MISTRICOLLE
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES A YOUNG PRIEST HAD BEEN LISTENING TO THE REASONING
OF THE HAUDRIETTES AND THE SENTENCES OF THE NOTARY
HE HAD A SEVERE
FACE WITH A LARGE BROW A PROFOUND GLANCE
HE THRUST THE CROWD SILENTLY
ASIDE SCRUTINIZED THE LITTLE MAGICIAN AND STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND
UPON HIM
IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR ALL THE DEVOTEES WERE ALREADY LICKING
THEIR CHOPS OVER THE FINE FLAMING FAGOT
I ADOPT THIS CHILD SAID THE PRIEST
HE TOOK IT IN HIS CASSOCK AND CARRIED IT OFF
THE SPECTATORS FOLLOWED
HIM WITH FRIGHTENED GLANCES
A MOMENT LATER HE HAD DISAPPEARED THROUGH
THE RED DOOR WHICH THEN LED FROM THE CHURCH TO THE CLOISTER
WHEN THE FIRST SURPRISE WAS OVER JEHANNE DE LA TARME BENT DOWN TO THE
EAR OF LA GAULTIRE
I TOLD YOU SO SISTER THAT YOUNG CLERK MONSIEUR CLAUDE FROLLO IS A
SORCERER
CHAPTER II
CLAUDE FROLLO
IN FACT CLAUDE FROLLO WAS NO COMMON PERSON
HE BELONGED TO ONE OF THOSE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHICH WERE CALLED
INDIFFERENTLY IN THE IMPERTINENT LANGUAGE OF THE LAST CENTURY THE HIGH
BOURGEOISE OR THE PETTY NOBILITY
THIS FAMILY HAD INHERITED FROM THE
BROTHERS PACLET THE FIEF OF TIRECHAPPE WHICH WAS DEPENDENT UPON THE
BISHOP OF PARIS AND WHOSE TWENTY ONE HOUSES HAD BEEN IN THE THIRTEENTH
CENTURY THE OBJECT OF SO MANY SUITS BEFORE THE OFFICIAL
AS POSSESSOR OF
THIS FIEF CLAUDE FROLLO WAS ONE OF THE TWENTY SEVEN SEIGNEURS KEEPING
CLAIM TO A MANOR IN FEE IN PARIS AND ITS SUBURBS AND FOR A LONG TIME
HIS NAME WAS TO BE SEEN INSCRIBED IN THIS QUALITY BETWEEN THE HTEL
DE TANCARVILLE BELONGING TO MASTER FRANOIS LE REZ AND THE COLLEGE OF
TOURS IN THE RECORDS DEPOSITED AT SAINT MARTIN DES CHAMPS
CLAUDE FROLLO HAD BEEN DESTINED FROM INFANCY BY HIS PARENTS TO THE
ECCLESIASTICAL PROFESSION
HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO READ IN LATIN HE HAD
BEEN TRAINED TO KEEP HIS EYES ON THE GROUND AND TO SPEAK LOW
WHILE
STILL A CHILD HIS FATHER HAD CLOISTERED HIM IN THE COLLEGE OF TORCHI IN
THE UNIVERSITY
THERE IT WAS THAT HE HAD GROWN UP ON THE MISSAL AND THE
LEXICON
MOREOVER HE WAS A SAD GRAVE SERIOUS CHILD WHO STUDIED ARDENTLY AND
LEARNED QUICKLY HE NEVER UTTERED A LOUD CRY IN RECREATION HOUR MIXED
BUT LITTLE IN THE BACCHANALS OF THE RUE DU FOUARRE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT
WAS TO DARE ALAPAS ET CAPILLOS LANIARE AND HAD CUT NO FIGURE IN THAT
REVOLT OF 1463 WHICH THE ANNALISTS REGISTER GRAVELY UNDER THE TITLE
OF THE SIXTH TROUBLE OF THE UNIVERSITY HE SELDOM RALLIED THE POOR
STUDENTS OF MONTAIGU ON THE CAPPETTES FROM WHICH THEY DERIVED THEIR
NAME OR THE BURSARS OF THE COLLEGE OF DORMANS ON THEIR SHAVED TONSURE
AND THEIR SURTOUT PARTI COLORED OF BLUISH GREEN BLUE AND VIOLET CLOTH
AZURINI COLORIS ET BRUNI AS SAYS THE CHARTER OF THE CARDINAL DES
QUATRE COURONNES
ON THE OTHER HAND HE WAS ASSIDUOUS AT THE GREAT AND THE SMALL SCHOOLS
OF THE RUE SAINT JEAN DE BEAUVAIS
THE FIRST PUPIL WHOM THE ABB DE
SAINT PIERRE DE VAL AT THE MOMENT OF BEGINNING HIS READING ON
CANON LAW ALWAYS PERCEIVED GLUED TO A PILLAR OF THE SCHOOL
SAINT VENDREGESILE OPPOSITE HIS ROSTRUM WAS CLAUDE FROLLO ARMED WITH
HIS HORN INK BOTTLE BITING HIS PEN SCRIBBLING ON HIS THREADBARE KNEE
AND IN WINTER BLOWING ON HIS FINGERS
THE FIRST AUDITOR WHOM MESSIRE
MILES D'ISLIERS DOCTOR IN DECRETALS SAW ARRIVE EVERY MONDAY MORNING
ALL BREATHLESS AT THE OPENING OF THE GATES OF THE SCHOOL OF THE
CHEF SAINT DENIS WAS CLAUDE FROLLO
THUS AT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE THE
YOUNG CLERK MIGHT HAVE HELD HIS OWN IN MYSTICAL THEOLOGY AGAINST A
FATHER OF THE CHURCH IN CANONICAL THEOLOGY AGAINST A FATHER OF THE
COUNCILS IN SCHOLASTIC THEOLOGY AGAINST A DOCTOR OF SORBONNE
THEOLOGY CONQUERED HE HAD PLUNGED INTO DECRETALS
FROM THE MASTER OF
SENTENCES HE HAD PASSED TO THE CAPITULARIES OF CHARLEMAGNE AND HE
HAD DEVOURED IN SUCCESSION IN HIS APPETITE FOR SCIENCE DECRETALS UPON
DECRETALS THOSE OF THEODORE BISHOP OF HISPALUS THOSE OF BOUCHARD
BISHOP OF WORMS THOSE OF YVES BISHOP OF CHARTRES NEXT THE DECRETAL
OF GRATIAN WHICH SUCCEEDED THE CAPITULARIES OF CHARLEMAGNE THEN
THE COLLECTION OF GREGORY IX THEN THE EPISTLE OF SUPERSPECULA OF
HONORIUS III
HE RENDERED CLEAR AND FAMILIAR TO HIMSELF THAT VAST AND
TUMULTUOUS PERIOD OF CIVIL LAW AND CANON LAW IN CONFLICT AND AT STRIFE
WITH EACH OTHER IN THE CHAOS OF THE MIDDLE AGES A PERIOD WHICH BISHOP
THEODORE OPENS IN 618 AND WHICH POPE GREGORY CLOSES IN 1227
DECRETALS DIGESTED HE FLUNG HIMSELF UPON MEDICINE ON THE LIBERAL ARTS
HE STUDIED THE SCIENCE OF HERBS THE SCIENCE OF UNGUENTS HE BECAME AN
EXPERT IN FEVERS AND IN CONTUSIONS IN SPRAINS AND ABCESSES
JACQUES
D' ESPARS WOULD HAVE RECEIVED HIM AS A PHYSICIAN RICHARD HELLAIN AS A
SURGEON
HE ALSO PASSED THROUGH ALL THE DEGREES OF LICENTIATE MASTER
AND DOCTOR OF ARTS
HE STUDIED THE LANGUAGES LATIN GREEK HEBREW A
TRIPLE SANCTUARY THEN VERY LITTLE FREQUENTED
HIS WAS A VERITABLE FEVER
FOR ACQUIRING AND HOARDING IN THE MATTER OF SCIENCE
AT THE AGE OF
EIGHTEEN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE FOUR FACULTIES IT SEEMED TO
THE YOUNG MAN THAT LIFE HAD BUT ONE SOLE OBJECT LEARNING
IT WAS TOWARDS THIS EPOCH THAT THE EXCESSIVE HEAT OF THE SUMMER OF 1466
CAUSED THAT GRAND OUTBURST OF THE PLAGUE WHICH CARRIED OFF MORE THAN
FORTY THOUSAND SOULS IN THE VICOMTY OF PARIS AND AMONG OTHERS AS JEAN
DE TROYES STATES MASTER ARNOUL ASTROLOGER TO THE KING WHO WAS A VERY
FINE MAN BOTH WISE AND PLEASANT THE RUMOR SPREAD IN THE UNIVERSITY
THAT THE RUE TIRECHAPPE WAS ESPECIALLY DEVASTATED BY THE MALADY
IT WAS
THERE THAT CLAUDE'S PARENTS RESIDED IN THE MIDST OF THEIR FIEF
THE
YOUNG SCHOLAR RUSHED IN GREAT ALARM TO THE PATERNAL MANSION
WHEN
HE ENTERED IT HE FOUND THAT BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER HAD DIED ON THE
PRECEDING DAY
A VERY YOUNG BROTHER OF HIS WHO WAS IN SWADDLING
CLOTHES WAS STILL ALIVE AND CRYING ABANDONED IN HIS CRADLE
THIS WAS
ALL THAT REMAINED TO CLAUDE OF HIS FAMILY THE YOUNG MAN TOOK THE CHILD
UNDER HIS ARM AND WENT OFF IN A PENSIVE MOOD
UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD
LIVED ONLY IN SCIENCE HE NOW BEGAN TO LIVE IN LIFE
THIS CATASTROPHE WAS A CRISIS IN CLAUDE'S EXISTENCE
ORPHANED THE
ELDEST HEAD OF THE FAMILY AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN HE FELT HIMSELF
RUDELY RECALLED FROM THE REVERIES OF SCHOOL TO THE REALITIES OF THIS
WORLD
THEN MOVED WITH PITY HE WAS SEIZED WITH PASSION AND DEVOTION
TOWARDS THAT CHILD HIS BROTHER A SWEET AND STRANGE THING WAS A HUMAN
AFFECTION TO HIM WHO HAD HITHERTO LOVED HIS BOOKS ALONE
THIS AFFECTION DEVELOPED TO A SINGULAR POINT IN A SOUL SO NEW IT WAS
LIKE A FIRST LOVE
SEPARATED SINCE INFANCY FROM HIS PARENTS WHOM HE HAD
HARDLY KNOWN CLOISTERED AND IMMURED AS IT WERE IN HIS BOOKS EAGER
ABOVE ALL THINGS TO STUDY AND TO LEARN EXCLUSIVELY ATTENTIVE UP TO
THAT TIME TO HIS INTELLIGENCE WHICH BROADENED IN SCIENCE TO HIS
IMAGINATION WHICH EXPANDED IN LETTERS THE POOR SCHOLAR HAD NOT YET
HAD TIME TO FEEL THE PLACE OF HIS HEART
THIS YOUNG BROTHER WITHOUT MOTHER OR FATHER THIS LITTLE CHILD WHICH
HAD FALLEN ABRUPTLY FROM HEAVEN INTO HIS ARMS MADE A NEW MAN OF HIM
HE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE IN THE WORLD BESIDES THE
SPECULATIONS OF THE SORBONNE AND THE VERSES OF HOMER THAT MAN NEEDED
AFFECTIONS THAT LIFE WITHOUT TENDERNESS AND WITHOUT LOVE WAS ONLY A SET
OF DRY SHRIEKING AND RENDING WHEELS
ONLY HE IMAGINED FOR HE WAS AT
THE AGE WHEN ILLUSIONS ARE AS YET REPLACED ONLY BY ILLUSIONS THAT THE
AFFECTIONS OF BLOOD AND FAMILY WERE THE SOLE ONES NECESSARY AND THAT A
LITTLE BROTHER TO LOVE SUFFICED TO FILL AN ENTIRE EXISTENCE
HE THREW HIMSELF THEREFORE INTO THE LOVE FOR HIS LITTLE JEHAN WITH THE
PASSION OF A CHARACTER ALREADY PROFOUND ARDENT CONCENTRATED THAT POOR
FRAIL CREATURE PRETTY FAIR HAIRED ROSY AND CURLY THAT ORPHAN WITH
ANOTHER ORPHAN FOR HIS ONLY SUPPORT TOUCHED HIM TO THE BOTTOM OF HIS
HEART AND GRAVE THINKER AS HE WAS HE SET TO MEDITATING UPON JEHAN
WITH AN INFINITE COMPASSION
HE KEPT WATCH AND WARD OVER HIM AS OVER
SOMETHING VERY FRAGILE AND VERY WORTHY OF CARE
HE WAS MORE THAN A
BROTHER TO THE CHILD HE BECAME A MOTHER TO HIM
LITTLE JEHAN HAD LOST HIS MOTHER WHILE HE WAS STILL AT THE BREAST
CLAUDE GAVE HIM TO A NURSE
BESIDES THE FIEF OF TIRECHAPPE HE HAD
INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER THE FIEF OF MOULIN WHICH WAS A DEPENDENCY OF
THE SQUARE TOWER OF GENTILLY IT WAS A MILL ON A HILL NEAR THE CHTEAU
OF WINCHESTRE BICTRE
THERE WAS A MILLER'S WIFE THERE WHO WAS NURSING
A FINE CHILD IT WAS NOT FAR FROM THE UNIVERSITY AND CLAUDE CARRIED THE
LITTLE JEHAN TO HER IN HIS OWN ARMS
FROM THAT TIME FORTH FEELING THAT HE HAD A BURDEN TO BEAR HE TOOK LIFE
VERY SERIOUSLY
THE THOUGHT OF HIS LITTLE BROTHER BECAME NOT ONLY HIS
RECREATION BUT THE OBJECT OF HIS STUDIES
HE RESOLVED TO CONSECRATE
HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO A FUTURE FOR WHICH HE WAS RESPONSIBLE IN THE SIGHT
OF GOD AND NEVER TO HAVE ANY OTHER WIFE ANY OTHER CHILD THAN THE
HAPPINESS AND FORTUNE OF HIS BROTHER
THEREFORE HE ATTACHED HIMSELF
MORE CLOSELY THAN EVER TO THE CLERICAL PROFESSION
HIS MERITS HIS
LEARNING HIS QUALITY OF IMMEDIATE VASSAL OF THE BISHOP OF PARIS THREW
THE DOORS OF THE CHURCH WIDE OPEN TO HIM
AT THE AGE OF TWENTY BY
SPECIAL DISPENSATION OF THE HOLY SEE HE WAS A PRIEST AND SERVED AS
THE YOUNGEST OF THE CHAPLAINS OF NOTRE DAME THE ALTAR WHICH IS CALLED
BECAUSE OF THE LATE MASS WHICH IS SAID THERE ALTARE PIGRORUM
THERE PLUNGED MORE DEEPLY THAN EVER IN HIS DEAR BOOKS WHICH HE QUITTED
ONLY TO RUN FOR AN HOUR TO THE FIEF OF MOULIN THIS MIXTURE OF LEARNING
AND AUSTERITY SO RARE AT HIS AGE HAD PROMPTLY ACQUIRED FOR HIM
THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF THE MONASTERY
FROM THE CLOISTER HIS
REPUTATION AS A LEARNED MAN HAD PASSED TO THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM IT HAD
CHANGED A LITTLE A FREQUENT OCCURRENCE AT THAT TIME INTO REPUTATION AS
A SORCERER
IT WAS AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE WAS RETURNING ON QUASIMODO DAY FROM
SAYING HIS MASS AT THE ALTAR OF THE LAZY WHICH WAS BY THE SIDE OF THE
DOOR LEADING TO THE NAVE ON THE RIGHT NEAR THE IMAGE OF THE VIRGIN
THAT HIS ATTENTION HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE GROUP OF OLD WOMEN
CHATTERING AROUND THE BED FOR FOUNDLINGS
THEN IT WAS THAT HE APPROACHED THE UNHAPPY LITTLE CREATURE WHICH WAS SO
HATED AND SO MENACED
THAT DISTRESS THAT DEFORMITY THAT ABANDONMENT
THE THOUGHT OF HIS YOUNG BROTHER THE IDEA WHICH SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO
HIM THAT IF HE WERE TO DIE HIS DEAR LITTLE JEHAN MIGHT ALSO BE FLUNG
MISERABLY ON THE PLANK FOR FOUNDLINGS ALL THIS HAD GONE TO HIS HEART
SIMULTANEOUSLY A GREAT PITY HAD MOVED IN HIM AND HE HAD CARRIED OFF
THE CHILD
WHEN HE REMOVED THE CHILD FROM THE SACK HE FOUND IT GREATLY DEFORMED
IN VERY SOOTH
THE POOR LITTLE WRETCH HAD A WART ON HIS LEFT EYE HIS
HEAD PLACED DIRECTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS HIS SPINAL COLUMN WAS CROOKED
HIS BREAST BONE PROMINENT AND HIS LEGS BOWED BUT HE APPEARED TO
BE LIVELY AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IN WHAT LANGUAGE
HE LISPED HIS CRY INDICATED CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND HEALTH
CLAUDE'S
COMPASSION INCREASED AT THE SIGHT OF THIS UGLINESS AND HE MADE A VOW IN
HIS HEART TO REAR THE CHILD FOR THE LOVE OF HIS BROTHER IN ORDER THAT
WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE FUTURE FAULTS OF THE LITTLE JEHAN HE SHOULD HAVE
BESIDE HIM THAT CHARITY DONE FOR HIS SAKE
IT WAS A SORT OF INVESTMENT
OF GOOD WORKS WHICH HE WAS EFFECTING IN THE NAME OF HIS YOUNG BROTHER
IT WAS A STOCK OF GOOD WORKS WHICH HE WISHED TO AMASS IN ADVANCE FOR
HIM IN CASE THE LITTLE ROGUE SHOULD SOME DAY FIND HIMSELF SHORT OF THAT
COIN THE ONLY SORT WHICH IS RECEIVED AT THE TOLL BAR OF PARADISE
HE BAPTIZED HIS ADOPTED CHILD AND GAVE HIM THE NAME OF QUASIMODO
EITHER BECAUSE HE DESIRED THEREBY TO MARK THE DAY WHEN HE HAD FOUND
HIM OR BECAUSE HE WISHED TO DESIGNATE BY THAT NAME TO WHAT A DEGREE THE
POOR LITTLE CREATURE WAS INCOMPLETE AND HARDLY SKETCHED OUT
IN FACT
QUASIMODO BLIND HUNCHBACKED KNOCK KNEED WAS ONLY AN ALMOST
CHAPTER III
IMMANIS PECORIS CUSTOS IMMANIOR IPSE
NOW IN 1482 QUASIMODO HAD GROWN UP
HE HAD BECOME A FEW YEARS
PREVIOUSLY THE BELLRINGER OF NOTRE DAME THANKS TO HIS FATHER BY
ADOPTION CLAUDE FROLLO WHO HAD BECOME ARCHDEACON OF JOSAS THANKS
TO HIS SUZERAIN MESSIRE LOUIS DE BEAUMONT WHO HAD BECOME BISHOP OF
PARIS AT THE DEATH OF GUILLAUME CHARTIER IN 1472 THANKS TO HIS PATRON
OLIVIER LE DAIM BARBER TO LOUIS XI KING BY THE GRACE OF GOD
SO QUASIMODO WAS THE RINGER OF THE CHIMES OF NOTRE DAME
IN THE COURSE OF TIME THERE HAD BEEN FORMED A CERTAIN PECULIARLY
INTIMATE BOND WHICH UNITED THE RINGER TO THE CHURCH
SEPARATED FOREVER
FROM THE WORLD BY THE DOUBLE FATALITY OF HIS UNKNOWN BIRTH AND HIS
NATURAL DEFORMITY IMPRISONED FROM HIS INFANCY IN THAT IMPASSABLE DOUBLE
CIRCLE THE POOR WRETCH HAD GROWN USED TO SEEING NOTHING IN THIS WORLD
BEYOND THE RELIGIOUS WALLS WHICH HAD RECEIVED HIM UNDER THEIR SHADOW
NOTRE DAME HAD BEEN TO HIM SUCCESSIVELY AS HE GREW UP AND DEVELOPED
THE EGG THE NEST THE HOUSE THE COUNTRY THE UNIVERSE
THERE WAS CERTAINLY A SORT OF MYSTERIOUS AND PRE EXISTING HARMONY
BETWEEN THIS CREATURE AND THIS CHURCH
WHEN STILL A LITTLE FELLOW HE
HAD DRAGGED HIMSELF TORTUOUSLY AND BY JERKS BENEATH THE SHADOWS OF
ITS VAULTS HE SEEMED WITH HIS HUMAN FACE AND HIS BESTIAL LIMBS THE
NATURAL REPTILE OF THAT HUMID AND SOMBRE PAVEMENT UPON WHICH THE SHADOW
OF THE ROMANESQUE CAPITALS CAST SO MANY STRANGE FORMS
LATER ON THE FIRST TIME THAT HE CAUGHT HOLD MECHANICALLY OF THE
ROPES TO THE TOWERS AND HUNG SUSPENDED FROM THEM AND SET THE BELL TO
CLANGING IT PRODUCED UPON HIS ADOPTED FATHER CLAUDE THE EFFECT OF A
CHILD WHOSE TONGUE IS UNLOOSED AND WHO BEGINS TO SPEAK
IT IS THUS THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE DEVELOPING ALWAYS IN SYMPATHY WITH
THE CATHEDRAL LIVING THERE SLEEPING THERE HARDLY EVER LEAVING IT
SUBJECT EVERY HOUR TO THE MYSTERIOUS IMPRESS HE CAME TO RESEMBLE IT HE
INCRUSTED HIMSELF IN IT SO TO SPEAK AND BECAME AN INTEGRAL PART OF IT
HIS SALIENT ANGLES FITTED INTO THE RETREATING ANGLES OF THE CATHEDRAL
IF WE MAY BE ALLOWED THIS FIGURE OF SPEECH AND HE SEEMED NOT ONLY ITS
INHABITANT BUT MORE THAN THAT ITS NATURAL TENANT
ONE MIGHT ALMOST
SAY THAT HE HAD ASSUMED ITS FORM AS THE SNAIL TAKES ON THE FORM OF
ITS SHELL
IT WAS HIS DWELLING HIS HOLE HIS ENVELOPE
THERE EXISTED
BETWEEN HIM AND THE OLD CHURCH SO PROFOUND AN INSTINCTIVE SYMPATHY SO
MANY MAGNETIC AFFINITIES SO MANY MATERIAL AFFINITIES THAT HE ADHERED
TO IT SOMEWHAT AS A TORTOISE ADHERES TO ITS SHELL
THE ROUGH AND
WRINKLED CATHEDRAL WAS HIS SHELL
IT IS USELESS TO WARN THE READER NOT TO TAKE LITERALLY ALL THE
SIMILES WHICH WE ARE OBLIGED TO EMPLOY HERE TO EXPRESS THE SINGULAR
SYMMETRICAL DIRECT ALMOST CONSUBSTANTIAL UNION OF A MAN AND AN
EDIFICE
IT IS EQUALLY UNNECESSARY TO STATE TO WHAT A DEGREE THAT
WHOLE CATHEDRAL WAS FAMILIAR TO HIM AFTER SO LONG AND SO INTIMATE A
COHABITATION
THAT DWELLING WAS PECULIAR TO HIM
IT HAD NO DEPTHS TO
WHICH QUASIMODO HAD NOT PENETRATED NO HEIGHT WHICH HE HAD NOT SCALED
HE OFTEN CLIMBED MANY STONES UP THE FRONT AIDED SOLELY BY THE UNEVEN
POINTS OF THE CARVING
THE TOWERS ON WHOSE EXTERIOR SURFACE HE WAS
FREQUENTLY SEEN CLAMBERING LIKE A LIZARD GLIDING ALONG A PERPENDICULAR
WALL THOSE TWO GIGANTIC TWINS SO LOFTY SO MENACING SO FORMIDABLE
POSSESSED FOR HIM NEITHER VERTIGO NOR TERROR NOR SHOCKS OF AMAZEMENT
TO SEE THEM SO GENTLE UNDER HIS HAND SO EASY TO SCALE ONE WOULD HAVE
SAID THAT HE HAD TAMED THEM
BY DINT OF LEAPING CLIMBING GAMBOLLING
AMID THE ABYSSES OF THE GIGANTIC CATHEDRAL HE HAD BECOME IN SOME SORT
A MONKEY AND A GOAT LIKE THE CALABRIAN CHILD WHO SWIMS BEFORE HE WALKS
AND PLAYS WITH THE SEA WHILE STILL A BABE
MOREOVER IT WAS NOT HIS BODY ALONE WHICH SEEMED FASHIONED AFTER THE
CATHEDRAL BUT HIS MIND ALSO
IN WHAT CONDITION WAS THAT MIND WHAT
BENT HAD IT CONTRACTED WHAT FORM HAD IT ASSUMED BENEATH THAT KNOTTED
ENVELOPE IN THAT SAVAGE LIFE THIS IT WOULD BE HARD TO DETERMINE
QUASIMODO HAD BEEN BORN ONE EYED HUNCHBACKED LAME
IT WAS WITH
GREAT DIFFICULTY AND BY DINT OF GREAT PATIENCE THAT CLAUDE FROLLO HAD
SUCCEEDED IN TEACHING HIM TO TALK
BUT A FATALITY WAS ATTACHED TO THE
POOR FOUNDLING
BELLRINGER OF NOTRE DAME AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN A NEW
INFIRMITY HAD COME TO COMPLETE HIS MISFORTUNES THE BELLS HAD BROKEN THE
DRUMS OF HIS EARS HE HAD BECOME DEAF
THE ONLY GATE WHICH NATURE HAD
LEFT WIDE OPEN FOR HIM HAD BEEN ABRUPTLY CLOSED AND FOREVER
IN CLOSING IT HAD CUT OFF THE ONLY RAY OF JOY AND OF LIGHT WHICH STILL
MADE ITS WAY INTO THE SOUL OF QUASIMODO
HIS SOUL FELL INTO PROFOUND
NIGHT
THE WRETCHED BEING'S MISERY BECAME AS INCURABLE AND AS COMPLETE
AS HIS DEFORMITY
LET US ADD THAT HIS DEAFNESS RENDERED HIM TO SOME
EXTENT DUMB
FOR IN ORDER NOT TO MAKE OTHERS LAUGH THE VERY MOMENT
THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF TO BE DEAF HE RESOLVED UPON A SILENCE WHICH HE
ONLY BROKE WHEN HE WAS ALONE
HE VOLUNTARILY TIED THAT TONGUE WHICH
CLAUDE FROLLO HAD TAKEN SO MUCH PAINS TO UNLOOSE
HENCE IT CAME ABOUT
THAT WHEN NECESSITY CONSTRAINED HIM TO SPEAK HIS TONGUE WAS TORPID
AWKWARD AND LIKE A DOOR WHOSE HINGES HAVE GROWN RUSTY
IF NOW WE WERE TO TRY TO PENETRATE TO THE SOUL OF QUASIMODO THROUGH THAT
THICK HARD RIND IF WE COULD SOUND THE DEPTHS OF THAT BADLY CONSTRUCTED
ORGANISM IF IT WERE GRANTED TO US TO LOOK WITH A TORCH BEHIND THOSE
NON TRANSPARENT ORGANS TO EXPLORE THE SHADOWY INTERIOR OF THAT OPAQUE
CREATURE TO ELUCIDATE HIS OBSCURE CORNERS HIS ABSURD NO THOROUGHFARES
AND SUDDENLY TO CAST A VIVID LIGHT UPON THE SOUL ENCHAINED AT THE
EXTREMITY OF THAT CAVE WE SHOULD NO DOUBT FIND THE UNHAPPY PSYCHE IN
SOME POOR CRAMPED AND RICKETTY ATTITUDE LIKE THOSE PRISONERS BENEATH
THE LEADS OF VENICE WHO GREW OLD BENT DOUBLE IN A STONE BOX WHICH WAS
BOTH TOO LOW AND TOO SHORT FOR THEM
IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE MIND BECOMES ATROPHIED IN A DEFECTIVE BODY
QUASIMODO WAS BARELY CONSCIOUS OF A SOUL CAST IN HIS OWN IMAGE MOVING
BLINDLY WITHIN HIM
THE IMPRESSIONS OF OBJECTS UNDERWENT A CONSIDERABLE
REFRACTION BEFORE REACHING HIS MIND
HIS BRAIN WAS A PECULIAR MEDIUM
THE IDEAS WHICH PASSED THROUGH IT ISSUED FORTH COMPLETELY DISTORTED
THE REFLECTION WHICH RESULTED FROM THIS REFRACTION WAS NECESSARILY
DIVERGENT AND PERVERTED
HENCE A THOUSAND OPTICAL ILLUSIONS A THOUSAND ABERRATIONS OF JUDGMENT
A THOUSAND DEVIATIONS IN WHICH HIS THOUGHT STRAYED NOW MAD NOW
IDIOTIC
THE FIRST EFFECT OF THIS FATAL ORGANIZATION WAS TO TROUBLE THE GLANCE
WHICH HE CAST UPON THINGS
HE RECEIVED HARDLY ANY IMMEDIATE PERCEPTION
OF THEM
THE EXTERNAL WORLD SEEMED MUCH FARTHER AWAY TO HIM THAN IT DOES
TO US
THE SECOND EFFECT OF HIS MISFORTUNE WAS TO RENDER HIM MALICIOUS
HE WAS MALICIOUS IN FACT BECAUSE HE WAS SAVAGE HE WAS SAVAGE BECAUSE
HE WAS UGLY
THERE WAS LOGIC IN HIS NATURE AS THERE IS IN OURS
HIS STRENGTH SO EXTRAORDINARILY DEVELOPED WAS A CAUSE OF STILL GREATER
MALEVOLENCE MALUS PUER ROBUSTUS SAYS HOBBES
THIS JUSTICE MUST HOWEVER BE RENDERED TO HIM
MALEVOLENCE WAS NOT
PERHAPS INNATE IN HIM
FROM HIS VERY FIRST STEPS AMONG MEN HE HAD FELT
HIMSELF LATER ON HE HAD SEEN HIMSELF SPEWED OUT BLASTED REJECTED
HUMAN WORDS WERE FOR HIM ALWAYS A RAILLERY OR A MALEDICTION
AS HE
GREW UP HE HAD FOUND NOTHING BUT HATRED AROUND HIM
HE HAD CAUGHT THE
GENERAL MALEVOLENCE
HE HAD PICKED UP THE WEAPON WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN
WOUNDED
AFTER ALL HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS MEN ONLY WITH RELUCTANCE
HIS CATHEDRAL WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM
IT WAS PEOPLED WITH MARBLE
FIGURES KINGS SAINTS BISHOPS WHO AT LEAST DID NOT BURST OUT
LAUGHING IN HIS FACE AND WHO GAZED UPON HIM ONLY WITH TRANQUILLITY
AND KINDLINESS
THE OTHER STATUES THOSE OF THE MONSTERS AND DEMONS
CHERISHED NO HATRED FOR HIM QUASIMODO
HE RESEMBLED THEM TOO MUCH FOR
THAT
THEY SEEMED RATHER TO BE SCOFFING AT OTHER MEN
THE SAINTS WERE
HIS FRIENDS AND BLESSED HIM THE MONSTERS WERE HIS FRIENDS AND GUARDED
HIM
SO HE HELD LONG COMMUNION WITH THEM
HE SOMETIMES PASSED WHOLE
HOURS CROUCHING BEFORE ONE OF THESE STATUES IN SOLITARY CONVERSATION
WITH IT
IF ANY ONE CAME HE FLED LIKE A LOVER SURPRISED IN HIS
SERENADE
AND THE CATHEDRAL WAS NOT ONLY SOCIETY FOR HIM BUT THE UNIVERSE AND
ALL NATURE BESIDE
HE DREAMED OF NO OTHER HEDGEROWS THAN THE PAINTED
WINDOWS ALWAYS IN FLOWER NO OTHER SHADE THAN THAT OF THE FOLIAGE OF
STONE WHICH SPREAD OUT LOADED WITH BIRDS IN THE TUFTS OF THE SAXON
CAPITALS OF NO OTHER MOUNTAINS THAN THE COLOSSAL TOWERS OF THE CHURCH
OF NO OTHER OCEAN THAN PARIS ROARING AT THEIR BASES
WHAT HE LOVED ABOVE ALL ELSE IN THE MATERNAL EDIFICE THAT WHICH AROUSED
HIS SOUL AND MADE IT OPEN ITS POOR WINGS WHICH IT KEPT SO MISERABLY
FOLDED IN ITS CAVERN THAT WHICH SOMETIMES RENDERED HIM EVEN HAPPY WAS
THE BELLS
HE LOVED THEM FONDLED THEM TALKED TO THEM UNDERSTOOD THEM
FROM THE CHIME IN THE SPIRE OVER THE INTERSECTION OF THE AISLES AND
NAVE TO THE GREAT BELL OF THE FRONT HE CHERISHED A TENDERNESS FOR THEM
ALL
THE CENTRAL SPIRE AND THE TWO TOWERS WERE TO HIM AS THREE GREAT
CAGES WHOSE BIRDS REARED BY HIMSELF SANG FOR HIM ALONE
YET IT WAS
THESE VERY BELLS WHICH HAD MADE HIM DEAF BUT MOTHERS OFTEN LOVE BEST
THAT CHILD WHICH HAS CAUSED THEM THE MOST SUFFERING
IT IS TRUE THAT THEIR VOICE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHICH HE COULD STILL
HEAR
ON THIS SCORE THE BIG BELL WAS HIS BELOVED
IT WAS SHE WHOM HE
PREFERRED OUT OF ALL THAT FAMILY OF NOISY GIRLS WHICH BUSTLED ABOVE
HIM ON FESTIVAL DAYS
THIS BELL WAS NAMED MARIE
SHE WAS ALONE IN THE
SOUTHERN TOWER WITH HER SISTER JACQUELINE A BELL OF LESSER SIZE SHUT
UP IN A SMALLER CAGE BESIDE HERS
THIS JACQUELINE WAS SO CALLED FROM THE
NAME OF THE WIFE OF JEAN MONTAGU WHO HAD GIVEN IT TO THE CHURCH WHICH
HAD NOT PREVENTED HIS GOING AND FIGURING WITHOUT HIS HEAD AT MONTFAUON
IN THE SECOND TOWER THERE WERE SIX OTHER BELLS AND FINALLY SIX
SMALLER ONES INHABITED THE BELFRY OVER THE CROSSING WITH THE WOODEN
BELL WHICH RANG ONLY BETWEEN AFTER DINNER ON GOOD FRIDAY AND THE
MORNING OF THE DAY BEFORE EASTER
SO QUASIMODO HAD FIFTEEN BELLS IN HIS
SERAGLIO BUT BIG MARIE WAS HIS FAVORITE
NO IDEA CAN BE FORMED OF HIS DELIGHT ON DAYS WHEN THE GRAND PEAL WAS
SOUNDED
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE ARCHDEACON DISMISSED HIM AND SAID
GO HE MOUNTED THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE CLOCK TOWER FASTER THAN ANY
ONE ELSE COULD HAVE DESCENDED IT
HE ENTERED PERFECTLY BREATHLESS INTO
THE AERIAL CHAMBER OF THE GREAT BELL HE GAZED AT HER A MOMENT DEVOUTLY
AND LOVINGLY THEN HE GENTLY ADDRESSED HER AND PATTED HER WITH HIS
HAND LIKE A GOOD HORSE WHICH IS ABOUT TO SET OUT ON A LONG JOURNEY
HE PITIED HER FOR THE TROUBLE THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO SUFFER
AFTER THESE
FIRST CARESSES HE SHOUTED TO HIS ASSISTANTS PLACED IN THE LOWER STORY
OF THE TOWER TO BEGIN
THEY GRASPED THE ROPES THE WHEEL CREAKED THE
ENORMOUS CAPSULE OF METAL STARTED SLOWLY INTO MOTION
QUASIMODO FOLLOWED
IT WITH HIS GLANCE AND TREMBLED
THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE CLAPPER AND
THE BRAZEN WALL MADE THE FRAMEWORK UPON WHICH IT WAS MOUNTED QUIVER
QUASIMODO VIBRATED WITH THE BELL
VAH HE CRIED WITH A SENSELESS BURST OF LAUGHTER
HOWEVER THE
MOVEMENT OF THE BASS WAS ACCELERATED AND IN PROPORTION AS IT DESCRIBED
A WIDER ANGLE QUASIMODO'S EYE OPENED ALSO MORE AND MORE WIDELY
PHOSPHORIC AND FLAMING
AT LENGTH THE GRAND PEAL BEGAN THE WHOLE TOWER
TREMBLED WOODWORK LEADS CUT STONES ALL GROANED AT ONCE FROM THE
PILES OF THE FOUNDATION TO THE TREFOILS OF ITS SUMMIT
THEN QUASIMODO
BOILED AND FROTHED HE WENT AND CAME HE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH
THE TOWER
THE BELL FURIOUS RUNNING RIOT PRESENTED TO THE TWO
WALLS OF THE TOWER ALTERNATELY ITS BRAZEN THROAT WHENCE ESCAPED THAT
TEMPESTUOUS BREATH WHICH IS AUDIBLE LEAGUES AWAY
QUASIMODO STATIONED
HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THIS OPEN THROAT HE CROUCHED AND ROSE WITH THE
OSCILLATIONS OF THE BELL BREATHED IN THIS OVERWHELMING BREATH GAZED
BY TURNS AT THE DEEP PLACE WHICH SWARMED WITH PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED FEET
BELOW HIM AND AT THAT ENORMOUS BRAZEN TONGUE WHICH CAME SECOND AFTER
SECOND TO HOWL IN HIS EAR
IT WAS THE ONLY SPEECH WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD THE ONLY SOUND WHICH BROKE
FOR HIM THE UNIVERSAL SILENCE
HE SWELLED OUT IN IT AS A BIRD DOES IN
THE SUN
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE FRENZY OF THE BELL SEIZED UPON HIM HIS
LOOK BECAME EXTRAORDINARY HE LAY IN WAIT FOR THE GREAT BELL AS IT
PASSED AS A SPIDER LIES IN WAIT FOR A FLY AND FLUNG HIMSELF ABRUPTLY
UPON IT WITH MIGHT AND MAIN
THEN SUSPENDED ABOVE THE ABYSS BORNE
TO AND FRO BY THE FORMIDABLE SWINGING OF THE BELL HE SEIZED THE BRAZEN
MONSTER BY THE EAR LAPS PRESSED IT BETWEEN BOTH KNEES SPURRED IT ON
WITH HIS HEELS AND REDOUBLED THE FURY OF THE PEAL WITH THE WHOLE SHOCK
AND WEIGHT OF HIS BODY
MEANWHILE THE TOWER TREMBLED HE SHRIEKED AND
GNASHED HIS TEETH HIS RED HAIR ROSE ERECT HIS BREAST HEAVING LIKE A
BELLOWS HIS EYE FLASHED FLAMES THE MONSTROUS BELL NEIGHED PANTING
BENEATH HIM AND THEN IT WAS NO LONGER THE GREAT BELL OF NOTRE DAME NOR
QUASIMODO IT WAS A DREAM A WHIRLWIND A TEMPEST DIZZINESS MOUNTED
ASTRIDE OF NOISE A SPIRIT CLINGING TO A FLYING CRUPPER A STRANGE
CENTAUR HALF MAN HALF BELL A SORT OF HORRIBLE ASTOLPHUS BORNE AWAY
UPON A PRODIGIOUS HIPPOGRIFF OF LIVING BRONZE
THE PRESENCE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY BEING CAUSED AS IT WERE A BREATH OF
LIFE TO CIRCULATE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CATHEDRAL
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH
THERE ESCAPED FROM HIM AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE GROWING SUPERSTITIONS
OF THE CROWD A MYSTERIOUS EMANATION WHICH ANIMATED ALL THE STONES OF
NOTRE DAME AND MADE THE DEEP BOWELS OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH TO PALPITATE
IT SUFFICED FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT HE WAS THERE TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE
THAT THEY BEHELD THE THOUSAND STATUES OF THE GALLERIES AND THE FRONTS IN
MOTION
AND THE CATHEDRAL DID INDEED SEEM A DOCILE AND OBEDIENT CREATURE
BENEATH HIS HAND IT WAITED ON HIS WILL TO RAISE ITS GREAT VOICE IT
WAS POSSESSED AND FILLED WITH QUASIMODO AS WITH A FAMILIAR SPIRIT
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE MADE THE IMMENSE EDIFICE BREATHE
HE WAS
EVERYWHERE ABOUT IT IN FACT HE MULTIPLIED HIMSELF ON ALL POINTS OF THE
STRUCTURE
NOW ONE PERCEIVED WITH AFFRIGHT AT THE VERY TOP OF ONE OF
THE TOWERS A FANTASTIC DWARF CLIMBING WRITHING CRAWLING ON ALL
FOURS DESCENDING OUTSIDE ABOVE THE ABYSS LEAPING FROM PROJECTION TO
PROJECTION AND GOING TO RANSACK THE BELLY OF SOME SCULPTURED GORGON IT
WAS QUASIMODO DISLODGING THE CROWS
AGAIN IN SOME OBSCURE CORNER OF THE
CHURCH ONE CAME IN CONTACT WITH A SORT OF LIVING CHIMERA CROUCHING
AND SCOWLING IT WAS QUASIMODO ENGAGED IN THOUGHT
SOMETIMES ONE CAUGHT
SIGHT UPON A BELL TOWER OF AN ENORMOUS HEAD AND A BUNDLE OF DISORDERED
LIMBS SWINGING FURIOUSLY AT THE END OF A ROPE IT WAS QUASIMODO RINGING
VESPERS OR THE ANGELUS
OFTEN AT NIGHT A HIDEOUS FORM WAS SEEN WANDERING
ALONG THE FRAIL BALUSTRADE OF CARVED LACEWORK WHICH CROWNS THE TOWERS
AND BORDERS THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE APSE AGAIN IT WAS THE HUNCHBACK OF
NOTRE DAME
THEN SAID THE WOMEN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE WHOLE CHURCH
TOOK ON SOMETHING FANTASTIC SUPERNATURAL HORRIBLE EYES AND MOUTHS
WERE OPENED HERE AND THERE ONE HEARD THE DOGS THE MONSTERS AND THE
GARGOYLES OF STONE WHICH KEEP WATCH NIGHT AND DAY WITH OUTSTRETCHED
NECK AND OPEN JAWS AROUND THE MONSTROUS CATHEDRAL BARKING
AND IF
IT WAS A CHRISTMAS EVE WHILE THE GREAT BELL WHICH SEEMED TO EMIT THE
DEATH RATTLE SUMMONED THE FAITHFUL TO THE MIDNIGHT MASS SUCH AN AIR
WAS SPREAD OVER THE SOMBRE FAADE THAT ONE WOULD HAVE DECLARED THAT
THE GRAND PORTAL WAS DEVOURING THE THRONG AND THAT THE ROSE WINDOW WAS
WATCHING IT
AND ALL THIS CAME FROM QUASIMODO
EGYPT WOULD HAVE TAKEN
HIM FOR THE GOD OF THIS TEMPLE THE MIDDLE AGES BELIEVED HIM TO BE ITS
DEMON HE WAS IN FACT ITS SOUL
TO SUCH AN EXTENT WAS THIS DISEASE THAT FOR THOSE WHO KNOW THAT
QUASIMODO HAS EXISTED NOTRE DAME IS TO DAY DESERTED INANIMATE DEAD
ONE FEELS THAT SOMETHING HAS DISAPPEARED FROM IT
THAT IMMENSE BODY IS
EMPTY IT IS A SKELETON THE SPIRIT HAS QUITTED IT ONE SEES ITS PLACE
AND THAT IS ALL
IT IS LIKE A SKULL WHICH STILL HAS HOLES FOR THE EYES
BUT NO LONGER SIGHT
CHAPTER IV
THE DOG AND HIS MASTER
NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS ONE HUMAN CREATURE WHOM QUASIMODO EXCEPTED FROM
HIS MALICE AND FROM HIS HATRED FOR OTHERS AND WHOM HE LOVED EVEN MORE
PERHAPS THAN HIS CATHEDRAL THIS WAS CLAUDE FROLLO
THE MATTER WAS SIMPLE CLAUDE FROLLO HAD TAKEN HIM IN HAD ADOPTED HIM
HAD NOURISHED HIM HAD REARED HIM
WHEN A LITTLE LAD IT WAS BETWEEN
CLAUDE FROLLO'S LEGS THAT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SEEK REFUGE WHEN THE
DOGS AND THE CHILDREN BARKED AFTER HIM
CLAUDE FROLLO HAD TAUGHT HIM
TO TALK TO READ TO WRITE
CLAUDE FROLLO HAD FINALLY MADE HIM THE
BELLRINGER
NOW TO GIVE THE BIG BELL IN MARRIAGE TO QUASIMODO WAS TO
GIVE JULIET TO ROMEO
HENCE QUASIMODO'S GRATITUDE WAS PROFOUND PASSIONATE BOUNDLESS AND
ALTHOUGH THE VISAGE OF HIS ADOPTED FATHER WAS OFTEN CLOUDED OR SEVERE
ALTHOUGH HIS SPEECH WAS HABITUALLY CURT HARSH IMPERIOUS THAT
GRATITUDE NEVER WAVERED FOR A SINGLE MOMENT
THE ARCHDEACON HAD IN
QUASIMODO THE MOST SUBMISSIVE SLAVE THE MOST DOCILE LACKEY THE MOST
VIGILANT OF DOGS
WHEN THE POOR BELLRINGER BECAME DEAF THERE HAD
BEEN ESTABLISHED BETWEEN HIM AND CLAUDE FROLLO A LANGUAGE OF SIGNS
MYSTERIOUS AND UNDERSTOOD BY THEMSELVES ALONE
IN THIS MANNER THE
ARCHDEACON WAS THE SOLE HUMAN BEING WITH WHOM QUASIMODO HAD PRESERVED
COMMUNICATION
HE WAS IN SYMPATHY WITH BUT TWO THINGS IN THIS WORLD
NOTRE DAME AND CLAUDE FROLLO
THERE IS NOTHING WHICH CAN BE COMPARED WITH THE EMPIRE OF THE ARCHDEACON
OVER THE BELLRINGER WITH THE ATTACHMENT OF THE BELLRINGER FOR THE
ARCHDEACON
A SIGN FROM CLAUDE AND THE IDEA OF GIVING HIM PLEASURE WOULD
HAVE SUFFICED TO MAKE QUASIMODO HURL HIMSELF HEADLONG FROM THE SUMMIT OF
NOTRE DAME
IT WAS A REMARKABLE THING ALL THAT PHYSICAL STRENGTH WHICH
HAD REACHED IN QUASIMODO SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT AND WHICH
WAS PLACED BY HIM BLINDLY AT THE DISPOSITION OF ANOTHER
THERE WAS IN
IT NO DOUBT FILIAL DEVOTION DOMESTIC ATTACHMENT THERE WAS ALSO THE
FASCINATION OF ONE SPIRIT BY ANOTHER SPIRIT
IT WAS A POOR AWKWARD AND
CLUMSY ORGANIZATION WHICH STOOD WITH LOWERED HEAD AND SUPPLICATING EYES
BEFORE A LOFTY AND PROFOUND A POWERFUL AND SUPERIOR INTELLECT
LASTLY
AND ABOVE ALL IT WAS GRATITUDE
GRATITUDE SO PUSHED TO ITS EXTREMEST
LIMIT THAT WE DO NOT KNOW TO WHAT TO COMPARE IT
THIS VIRTUE IS NOT ONE
OF THOSE OF WHICH THE FINEST EXAMPLES ARE TO BE MET WITH AMONG MEN
WE
WILL SAY THEN THAT QUASIMODO LOVED THE ARCHDEACON AS NEVER A DOG NEVER
A HORSE NEVER AN ELEPHANT LOVED HIS MASTER
CHAPTER V
MORE ABOUT CLAUDE FROLLO
IN 1482 QUASIMODO WAS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OF AGE CLAUDE FROLLO ABOUT
THIRTY SIX
ONE HAD GROWN UP THE OTHER HAD GROWN OLD
CLAUDE FROLLO WAS NO LONGER THE SIMPLE SCHOLAR OF THE COLLEGE OF TORCH
THE TENDER PROTECTOR OF A LITTLE CHILD THE YOUNG AND DREAMY PHILOSOPHER
WHO KNEW MANY THINGS AND WAS IGNORANT OF MANY
HE WAS A PRIEST AUSTERE
GRAVE MOROSE ONE CHARGED WITH SOULS MONSIEUR THE ARCHDEACON OF JOSAS
THE BISHOP'S SECOND ACOLYTE HAVING CHARGE OF THE TWO DEANERIES OF
MONTLHRY AND CHTEAUFORT AND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR COUNTRY
CURACIES
HE WAS AN IMPOSING AND SOMBRE PERSONAGE BEFORE WHOM THE CHOIR
BOYS IN ALB AND IN JACKET TREMBLED AS WELL AS THE MACHICOTS AND THE
BROTHERS OF SAINT AUGUSTINE AND THE MATUTINAL CLERKS OF NOTRE DAME
WHEN HE PASSED SLOWLY BENEATH THE LOFTY ARCHES OF THE CHOIR MAJESTIC
THOUGHTFUL WITH ARMS FOLDED AND HIS HEAD SO BENT UPON HIS BREAST THAT
ALL ONE SAW OF HIS FACE WAS HIS LARGE BALD BROW
AN OFFICIAL OF NOTRE DAME LOWER THAN A BENEFICED CLERGYMAN
HIGHER THAN SIMPLE PAID CHANTERS
DOM CLAUDE FROLLO HAD HOWEVER ABANDONED NEITHER SCIENCE NOR THE
EDUCATION OF HIS YOUNG BROTHER THOSE TWO OCCUPATIONS OF HIS LIFE
BUT
AS TIME WENT ON SOME BITTERNESS HAD BEEN MINGLED WITH THESE THINGS
WHICH WERE SO SWEET
IN THE LONG RUN SAYS PAUL DIACRE THE BEST LARD
TURNS RANCID
LITTLE JEHAN FROLLO SURNAMED DU MOULIN OF THE MILL
BECAUSE OF THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN REARED HAD NOT GROWN UP IN THE
DIRECTION WHICH CLAUDE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO IMPOSE UPON HIM
THE BIG
BROTHER COUNTED UPON A PIOUS DOCILE LEARNED AND HONORABLE PUPIL
BUT
THE LITTLE BROTHER LIKE THOSE YOUNG TREES WHICH DECEIVE THE GARDENER'S
HOPES AND TURN OBSTINATELY TO THE QUARTER WHENCE THEY RECEIVE SUN AND
AIR THE LITTLE BROTHER DID NOT GROW AND DID NOT MULTIPLY BUT ONLY
PUT FORTH FINE BUSHY AND LUXURIANT BRANCHES ON THE SIDE OF LAZINESS
IGNORANCE AND DEBAUCHERY
HE WAS A REGULAR DEVIL AND A VERY DISORDERLY
ONE WHO MADE DOM CLAUDE SCOWL BUT VERY DROLL AND VERY SUBTLE WHICH
MADE THE BIG BROTHER SMILE
CLAUDE HAD CONFIDED HIM TO THAT SAME COLLEGE OF TORCHI WHERE HE HAD
PASSED HIS EARLY YEARS IN STUDY AND MEDITATION AND IT WAS A GRIEF TO
HIM THAT THIS SANCTUARY FORMERLY EDIFIED BY THE NAME OF FROLLO SHOULD
TO DAY BE SCANDALIZED BY IT
HE SOMETIMES PREACHED JEHAN VERY LONG AND
SEVERE SERMONS WHICH THE LATTER INTREPIDLY ENDURED
AFTER ALL THE
YOUNG SCAPEGRACE HAD A GOOD HEART AS CAN BE SEEN IN ALL COMEDIES
BUT THE SERMON OVER HE NONE THE LESS TRANQUILLY RESUMED HIS COURSE OF
SEDITIONS AND ENORMITIES
NOW IT WAS A BEJAUNE OR YELLOW BEAK AS THEY
CALLED THE NEW ARRIVALS AT THE UNIVERSITY WHOM HE HAD BEEN MAULING BY
WAY OF WELCOME A PRECIOUS TRADITION WHICH HAS BEEN CAREFULLY PRESERVED
TO OUR OWN DAY
AGAIN HE HAD SET IN MOVEMENT A BAND OF SCHOLARS
WHO HAD FLUNG THEMSELVES UPON A WINE SHOP IN CLASSIC FASHION QUASI
CLASSICO EXCITATI HAD THEN BEATEN THE TAVERN KEEPER WITH OFFENSIVE
CUDGELS AND JOYOUSLY PILLAGED THE TAVERN EVEN TO SMASHING IN THE
HOGSHEADS OF WINE IN THE CELLAR
AND THEN IT WAS A FINE REPORT IN LATIN
WHICH THE SUB MONITOR OF TORCHI CARRIED PITEOUSLY TO DOM CLAUDE WITH
THIS DOLOROUS MARGINAL COMMENT RIXA PRIMA CAUSA VINUM OPTIMUM
POTATUM
FINALLY IT WAS SAID A THING QUITE HORRIBLE IN A BOY OF
SIXTEEN THAT HIS DEBAUCHERY OFTEN EXTENDED AS FAR AS THE RUE DE
GLATIGNY
CLAUDE SADDENED AND DISCOURAGED IN HIS HUMAN AFFECTIONS BY ALL THIS
HAD FLUNG HIMSELF EAGERLY INTO THE ARMS OF LEARNING THAT SISTER WHICH
AT LEAST DOES NOT LAUGH IN YOUR FACE AND WHICH ALWAYS PAYS YOU THOUGH
IN MONEY THAT IS SOMETIMES A LITTLE HOLLOW FOR THE ATTENTION WHICH YOU
HAVE PAID TO HER
HENCE HE BECAME MORE AND MORE LEARNED AND AT THE
SAME TIME AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE MORE AND MORE RIGID AS A
PRIEST MORE AND MORE SAD AS A MAN
THERE ARE FOR EACH OF US SEVERAL
PARALLELISMS BETWEEN OUR INTELLIGENCE OUR HABITS AND OUR CHARACTER
WHICH DEVELOP WITHOUT A BREAK AND BREAK ONLY IN THE GREAT DISTURBANCES
OF LIFE
AS CLAUDE FROLLO HAD PASSED THROUGH NEARLY THE ENTIRE CIRCLE OF HUMAN
LEARNING POSITIVE EXTERIOR AND PERMISSIBLE SINCE HIS YOUTH HE
WAS OBLIGED UNLESS HE CAME TO A HALT UBI DEFUIT ORBIS TO PROCEED
FURTHER AND SEEK OTHER ALIMENTS FOR THE INSATIABLE ACTIVITY OF HIS
INTELLIGENCE
THE ANTIQUE SYMBOL OF THE SERPENT BITING ITS TAIL IS
ABOVE ALL APPLICABLE TO SCIENCE
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT CLAUDE FROLLO HAD
EXPERIENCED THIS
MANY GRAVE PERSONS AFFIRM THAT AFTER HAVING EXHAUSTED
THE FAS OF HUMAN LEARNING HE HAD DARED TO PENETRATE INTO THE NEFAS
HE HAD THEY SAID TASTED IN SUCCESSION ALL THE APPLES OF THE TREE OF
KNOWLEDGE AND WHETHER FROM HUNGER OR DISGUST HAD ENDED BY TASTING
THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT
HE HAD TAKEN HIS PLACE BY TURNS AS THE READER
HAS SEEN IN THE CONFERENCES OF THE THEOLOGIANS IN SORBONNE IN THE
ASSEMBLIES OF THE DOCTORS OF ART AFTER THE MANNER OF SAINT HILAIRE IN
THE DISPUTES OF THE DECRETALISTS AFTER THE MANNER OF SAINT MARTIN IN
THE CONGREGATIONS OF PHYSICIANS AT THE HOLY WATER FONT OF NOTRE DAME
AD CUPAM NOSTROE DOMINOE
ALL THE DISHES PERMITTED AND APPROVED WHICH
THOSE FOUR GREAT KITCHENS CALLED THE FOUR FACULTIES COULD ELABORATE AND
SERVE TO THE UNDERSTANDING HE HAD DEVOURED AND HAD BEEN SATIATED WITH
THEM BEFORE HIS HUNGER WAS APPEASED
THEN HE HAD PENETRATED FURTHER
LOWER BENEATH ALL THAT FINISHED MATERIAL LIMITED KNOWLEDGE HE HAD
PERHAPS RISKED HIS SOUL AND HAD SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CAVERN AT
THAT MYSTERIOUS TABLE OF THE ALCHEMISTS OF THE ASTROLOGERS OF THE
HERMETICS OF WHICH AVERROS GILLAUME DE PARIS AND NICOLAS FLAMEL HOLD
THE END IN THE MIDDLE AGES AND WHICH EXTENDS IN THE EAST BY THE
LIGHT OF THE SEVEN BRANCHED CANDLESTICK TO SOLOMON PYTHAGORAS AND
ZOROASTER
THAT IS AT LEAST WHAT WAS SUPPOSED WHETHER RIGHTLY OR NOT
IT
IS CERTAIN THAT THE ARCHDEACON OFTEN VISITED THE CEMETERY OF THE
SAINTS INNOCENTS WHERE IT IS TRUE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HAD BEEN
BURIED WITH OTHER VICTIMS OF THE PLAGUE OF 1466 BUT THAT HE APPEARED
FAR LESS DEVOUT BEFORE THE CROSS OF THEIR GRAVE THAN BEFORE THE STRANGE
FIGURES WITH WHICH THE TOMB OF NICOLAS FLAMEL AND CLAUDE PERNELLE
ERECTED JUST BESIDE IT WAS LOADED
IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD FREQUENTLY BEEN SEEN TO PASS ALONG THE RUE DES
LOMBARDS AND FURTIVELY ENTER A LITTLE HOUSE WHICH FORMED THE CORNER
OF THE RUE DES ECRIVANS AND THE RUE MARIVAULT
IT WAS THE HOUSE WHICH
NICOLAS FLAMEL HAD BUILT WHERE HE HAD DIED ABOUT 1417 AND WHICH
CONSTANTLY DESERTED SINCE THAT TIME HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FALL IN
RUINS SO GREATLY HAD THE HERMETICS AND THE ALCHEMISTS OF ALL COUNTRIES
WASTED AWAY THE WALLS MERELY BY CARVING THEIR NAMES UPON THEM
SOME
NEIGHBORS EVEN AFFIRM THAT THEY HAD ONCE SEEN THROUGH AN AIR HOLE
ARCHDEACON CLAUDE EXCAVATING TURNING OVER DIGGING UP THE EARTH IN THE
TWO CELLARS WHOSE SUPPORTS HAD BEEN DAUBED WITH NUMBERLESS COUPLETS AND
HIEROGLYPHICS BY NICOLAS FLAMEL HIMSELF
IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT FLAMEL HAD
BURIED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE IN THE CELLAR AND THE ALCHEMISTS FOR
THE SPACE OF TWO CENTURIES FROM MAGISTRI TO FATHER PACIFIQUE NEVER
CEASED TO WORRY THE SOIL UNTIL THE HOUSE SO CRUELLY RANSACKED AND
TURNED OVER ENDED BY FALLING INTO DUST BENEATH THEIR FEET
AGAIN IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE ARCHDEACON HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH A SINGULAR
PASSION FOR THE SYMBOLICAL DOOR OF NOTRE DAME THAT PAGE OF A CONJURING
BOOK WRITTEN IN STONE BY BISHOP GUILLAUME DE PARIS WHO HAS NO DOUBT
BEEN DAMNED FOR HAVING AFFIXED SO INFERNAL A FRONTISPIECE TO THE SACRED
POEM CHANTED BY THE REST OF THE EDIFICE
ARCHDEACON CLAUDE HAD THE
CREDIT ALSO OF HAVING FATHOMED THE MYSTERY OF THE COLOSSUS OF SAINT
CHRISTOPHER AND OF THAT LOFTY ENIGMATICAL STATUE WHICH THEN STOOD AT
THE ENTRANCE OF THE VESTIBULE AND WHICH THE PEOPLE IN DERISION
CALLED MONSIEUR LEGRIS BUT WHAT EVERY ONE MIGHT HAVE NOTICED WAS THE
INTERMINABLE HOURS WHICH HE OFTEN EMPLOYED SEATED UPON THE PARAPET OF
THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH IN CONTEMPLATING THE SCULPTURES OF THE
FRONT EXAMINING NOW THE FOOLISH VIRGINS WITH THEIR LAMPS REVERSED NOW
THE WISE VIRGINS WITH THEIR LAMPS UPRIGHT AGAIN CALCULATING THE ANGLE
OF VISION OF THAT RAVEN WHICH BELONGS TO THE LEFT FRONT AND WHICH IS
LOOKING AT A MYSTERIOUS POINT INSIDE THE CHURCH WHERE IS CONCEALED THE
PHILOSOPHER'S STONE IF IT BE NOT IN THE CELLAR OF NICOLAS FLAMEL
IT WAS LET US REMARK IN PASSING A SINGULAR FATE FOR THE CHURCH OF
NOTRE DAME AT THAT EPOCH TO BE SO BELOVED IN TWO DIFFERENT DEGREES
AND WITH SO MUCH DEVOTION BY TWO BEINGS SO DISSIMILAR AS CLAUDE AND
QUASIMODO
BELOVED BY ONE A SORT OF INSTINCTIVE AND SAVAGE HALF MAN
FOR ITS BEAUTY FOR ITS STATURE FOR THE HARMONIES WHICH EMANATED FROM
ITS MAGNIFICENT ENSEMBLE BELOVED BY THE OTHER A LEARNED AND PASSIONATE
IMAGINATION FOR ITS MYTH FOR THE SENSE WHICH IT CONTAINS FOR THE
SYMBOLISM SCATTERED BENEATH THE SCULPTURES OF ITS FRONT LIKE THE FIRST
TEXT UNDERNEATH THE SECOND IN A PALIMPSEST IN A WORD FOR THE ENIGMA
WHICH IT IS ETERNALLY PROPOUNDING TO THE UNDERSTANDING
FURTHERMORE IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE ARCHDEACON HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF
IN THAT ONE OF THE TWO TOWERS WHICH LOOKS UPON THE GRVE JUST BESIDE
THE FRAME FOR THE BELLS A VERY SECRET LITTLE CELL INTO WHICH NO ONE
NOT EVEN THE BISHOP ENTERED WITHOUT HIS LEAVE IT WAS SAID
THIS TINY
CELL HAD FORMERLY BEEN MADE ALMOST AT THE SUMMIT OF THE TOWER AMONG THE
RAVENS' NESTS BY BISHOP HUGO DE BESANON WHO HAD WROUGHT SORCERY THERE
IN HIS DAY
WHAT THAT CELL CONTAINED NO ONE KNEW BUT FROM THE STRAND
OF THE TERRAIN AT NIGHT THERE WAS OFTEN SEEN TO APPEAR DISAPPEAR
AND REAPPEAR AT BRIEF AND REGULAR INTERVALS AT A LITTLE DORMER WINDOW
OPENING UPON THE BACK OF THE TOWER A CERTAIN RED INTERMITTENT
SINGULAR LIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO FOLLOW THE PANTING BREATHS OF A BELLOWS
AND TO PROCEED FROM A FLAME RATHER THAN FROM A LIGHT
IN THE DARKNESS
AT THAT HEIGHT IT PRODUCED A SINGULAR EFFECT AND THE GOODWIVES SAID
THERE'S THE ARCHDEACON BLOWING HELL IS SPARKLING UP YONDER
HUGO II
DE BISUNCIO 1326 1332
THERE WERE NO GREAT PROOFS OF SORCERY IN THAT AFTER ALL BUT THERE WAS
STILL ENOUGH SMOKE TO WARRANT A SURMISE OF FIRE AND THE ARCHDEACON BORE
A TOLERABLY FORMIDABLE REPUTATION
WE OUGHT TO MENTION HOWEVER THAT THE
SCIENCES OF EGYPT THAT NECROMANCY AND MAGIC EVEN THE WHITEST EVEN THE
MOST INNOCENT HAD NO MORE ENVENOMED ENEMY NO MORE PITILESS DENUNCIATOR
BEFORE THE GENTLEMEN OF THE OFFICIALTY OF NOTRE DAME
WHETHER THIS
WAS SINCERE HORROR OR THE GAME PLAYED BY THE THIEF WHO SHOUTS STOP
THIEF AT ALL EVENTS IT DID NOT PREVENT THE ARCHDEACON FROM BEING
CONSIDERED BY THE LEARNED HEADS OF THE CHAPTER AS A SOUL WHO HAD
VENTURED INTO THE VESTIBULE OF HELL WHO WAS LOST IN THE CAVES OF THE
CABAL GROPING AMID THE SHADOWS OF THE OCCULT SCIENCES
NEITHER WERE
THE PEOPLE DECEIVED THEREBY WITH ANY ONE WHO POSSESSED ANY SAGACITY
QUASIMODO PASSED FOR THE DEMON CLAUDE FROLLO FOR THE SORCERER
IT
WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BELLRINGER WAS TO SERVE THE ARCHDEACON FOR A GIVEN
TIME AT THE END OF WHICH HE WOULD CARRY AWAY THE LATTER'S SOUL BY WAY
OF PAYMENT
THUS THE ARCHDEACON IN SPITE OF THE EXCESSIVE AUSTERITY OF
HIS LIFE WAS IN BAD ODOR AMONG ALL PIOUS SOULS AND THERE WAS NO DEVOUT
NOSE SO INEXPERIENCED THAT IT COULD NOT SMELL HIM OUT TO BE A MAGICIAN
AND IF AS HE GREW OLDER ABYSSES HAD FORMED IN HIS SCIENCE THEY HAD
ALSO FORMED IN HIS HEART
THAT AT LEAST IS WHAT ONE HAD GROUNDS FOR
BELIEVING ON SCRUTINIZING THAT FACE UPON WHICH THE SOUL WAS ONLY SEEN
TO SHINE THROUGH A SOMBRE CLOUD
WHENCE THAT LARGE BALD BROW THAT HEAD
FOREVER BENT THAT BREAST ALWAYS HEAVING WITH SIGHS WHAT SECRET THOUGHT
CAUSED HIS MOUTH TO SMILE WITH SO MUCH BITTERNESS AT THE SAME MOMENT
THAT HIS SCOWLING BROWS APPROACHED EACH OTHER LIKE TWO BULLS ON THE
POINT OF FIGHTING WHY WAS WHAT HAIR HE HAD LEFT ALREADY GRAY WHAT WAS
THAT INTERNAL FIRE WHICH SOMETIMES BROKE FORTH IN HIS GLANCE TO SUCH A
DEGREE THAT HIS EYE RESEMBLED A HOLE PIERCED IN THE WALL OF A FURNACE
THESE SYMPTOMS OF A VIOLENT MORAL PREOCCUPATION HAD ACQUIRED AN
ESPECIALLY HIGH DEGREE OF INTENSITY AT THE EPOCH WHEN THIS STORY TAKES
PLACE
MORE THAN ONCE A CHOIR BOY HAD FLED IN TERROR AT FINDING HIM
ALONE IN THE CHURCH SO STRANGE AND DAZZLING WAS HIS LOOK
MORE THAN
ONCE IN THE CHOIR AT THE HOUR OF THE OFFICES HIS NEIGHBOR IN THE
STALLS HAD HEARD HIM MINGLE WITH THE PLAIN SONG AD OMNEM TONUM
UNINTELLIGIBLE PARENTHESES
MORE THAN ONCE THE LAUNDRESS OF THE TERRAIN
CHARGED WITH WASHING THE CHAPTER HAD OBSERVED NOT WITHOUT AFFRIGHT
THE MARKS OF NAILS AND CLENCHED FINGERS ON THE SURPLICE OF MONSIEUR THE
ARCHDEACON OF JOSAS
HOWEVER HE REDOUBLED HIS SEVERITY AND HAD NEVER BEEN MORE EXEMPLARY
BY PROFESSION AS WELL AS BY CHARACTER HE HAD ALWAYS HELD HIMSELF ALOOF
FROM WOMEN HE SEEMED TO HATE THEM MORE THAN EVER
THE MERE RUSTLING
OF A SILKEN PETTICOAT CAUSED HIS HOOD TO FALL OVER HIS EYES
UPON THIS
SCORE HE WAS SO JEALOUS OF AUSTERITY AND RESERVE THAT WHEN THE DAME DE
BEAUJEU THE KING'S DAUGHTER CAME TO VISIT THE CLOISTER OF NOTRE DAME
IN THE MONTH OF DECEMBER 1481 HE GRAVELY OPPOSED HER ENTRANCE
REMINDING THE BISHOP OF THE STATUTE OF THE BLACK BOOK DATING FROM THE
VIGIL OF SAINT BARTHLEMY 1334 WHICH INTERDICTS ACCESS TO THE CLOISTER
TO ANY WOMAN WHATEVER OLD OR YOUNG MISTRESS OR MAID UPON WHICH THE
BISHOP HAD BEEN CONSTRAINED TO RECITE TO HIM THE ORDINANCE OF LEGATE
ODO WHICH EXCEPTS CERTAIN GREAT DAMES ALIQU MAGNATES MULIERES
QU SINE SCANDALO VITARI NON POSSUNT
AND AGAIN THE ARCHDEACON HAD
PROTESTED OBJECTING THAT THE ORDINANCE OF THE LEGATE WHICH DATED BACK
TO 1207 WAS ANTERIOR BY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TO THE BLACK
BOOK AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS ABROGATED IN FACT BY IT
AND HE HAD REFUSED
TO APPEAR BEFORE THE PRINCESS
IT WAS ALSO NOTICED THAT HIS HORROR FOR BOHEMIAN WOMEN AND GYPSIES HAD
SEEMED TO REDOUBLE FOR SOME TIME PAST
HE HAD PETITIONED THE BISHOP FOR
AN EDICT WHICH EXPRESSLY FORBADE THE BOHEMIAN WOMEN TO COME AND DANCE
AND BEAT THEIR TAMBOURINES ON THE PLACE OF THE PARVIS AND FOR ABOUT THE
SAME LENGTH OF TIME HE HAD BEEN RANSACKING THE MOULDY PLACARDS OF
THE OFFICIALTY IN ORDER TO COLLECT THE CASES OF SORCERERS AND WITCHES
CONDEMNED TO FIRE OR THE ROPE FOR COMPLICITY IN CRIMES WITH RAMS SOWS
OR GOATS
CHAPTER VI
UNPOPULARITY
THE ARCHDEACON AND THE BELLRINGER AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID WERE BUT
LITTLE LOVED BY THE POPULACE GREAT AND SMALL IN THE VICINITY OF THE
CATHEDRAL
WHEN CLAUDE AND QUASIMODO WENT OUT TOGETHER WHICH FREQUENTLY
HAPPENED AND WHEN THEY WERE SEEN TRAVERSING IN COMPANY THE VALET
BEHIND THE MASTER THE COLD NARROW AND GLOOMY STREETS OF THE BLOCK OF
NOTRE DAME MORE THAN ONE EVIL WORD MORE THAN ONE IRONICAL QUAVER MORE
THAN ONE INSULTING JEST GREETED THEM ON THEIR WAY UNLESS CLAUDE FROLLO
WHICH WAS RARELY THE CASE WALKED WITH HEAD UPRIGHT AND RAISED SHOWING
HIS SEVERE AND ALMOST AUGUST BROW TO THE DUMBFOUNDED JEERERS
BOTH WERE IN THEIR QUARTER LIKE THE POETS OF WHOM RGNIER SPEAKS
ALL SORTS OF PERSONS RUN AFTER POETS
AS WARBLERS FLY SHRIEKING AFTER OWLS
SOMETIMES A MISCHIEVOUS CHILD RISKED HIS SKIN AND BONES FOR THE
INEFFABLE PLEASURE OF DRIVING A PIN INTO QUASIMODO'S HUMP
AGAIN A
YOUNG GIRL MORE BOLD AND SAUCY THAN WAS FITTING BRUSHED THE PRIEST'S
BLACK ROBE SINGING IN HIS FACE THE SARDONIC DITTY NICHE NICHE THE
DEVIL IS CAUGHT SOMETIMES A GROUP OF SQUALID OLD CRONES SQUATTING IN
A FILE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE STEPS TO A PORCH SCOLDED NOISILY AS THE
ARCHDEACON AND THE BELLRINGER PASSED AND TOSSED THEM THIS ENCOURAGING
WELCOME WITH A CURSE HUM THERE'S A FELLOW WHOSE SOUL IS MADE LIKE
THE OTHER ONE'S BODY OR A BAND OF SCHOOLBOYS AND STREET URCHINS
PLAYING HOP SCOTCH ROSE IN A BODY AND SALUTED HIM CLASSICALLY WITH
SOME CRY IN LATIN EIA EIA CLAUDIUS CUM CLAUDO
BUT THE INSULT GENERALLY PASSED UNNOTICED BOTH BY THE PRIEST AND THE
BELLRINGER
QUASIMODO WAS TOO DEAF TO HEAR ALL THESE GRACIOUS THINGS
AND CLAUDE WAS TOO DREAMY
BOOK FIFTH
CHAPTER I
ABBAS BEATI MARTINI
DOM CLAUDE'S FAME HAD SPREAD FAR AND WIDE
IT PROCURED FOR HIM AT ABOUT
THE EPOCH WHEN HE REFUSED TO SEE MADAME DE BEAUJEU A VISIT WHICH HE
LONG REMEMBERED
IT WAS IN THE EVENING
HE HAD JUST RETIRED AFTER THE OFFICE TO
HIS CANON'S CELL IN THE CLOISTER OF NOTRE DAME
THIS CELL WITH THE
EXCEPTION POSSIBLY OF SOME GLASS PHIALS RELEGATED TO A CORNER AND
FILLED WITH A DECIDEDLY EQUIVOCAL POWDER WHICH STRONGLY RESEMBLED
THE ALCHEMIST'S POWDER OF PROJECTION PRESENTED NOTHING STRANGE OR
MYSTERIOUS
THERE WERE INDEED HERE AND THERE SOME INSCRIPTIONS ON
THE WALLS BUT THEY WERE PURE SENTENCES OF LEARNING AND PIETY EXTRACTED
FROM GOOD AUTHORS
THE ARCHDEACON HAD JUST SEATED HIMSELF BY THE
LIGHT OF A THREE JETTED COPPER LAMP BEFORE A VAST COFFER CRAMMED WITH
MANUSCRIPTS
HE HAD RESTED HIS ELBOW UPON THE OPEN VOLUME OF HONORIUS
D'AUTUN DE PREDESTINATIONE ET LIBERO ARBITRIO AND HE WAS TURNING
OVER IN DEEP MEDITATION THE LEAVES OF A PRINTED FOLIO WHICH HE HAD
JUST BROUGHT THE SOLE PRODUCT OF THE PRESS WHICH HIS CELL CONTAINED
IN
THE MIDST OF HIS REVERY THERE CAME A KNOCK AT HIS DOOR
WHO'S THERE
CRIED THE LEARNED MAN IN THE GRACIOUS TONE OF A FAMISHED DOG DISTURBED
OVER HIS BONE
A VOICE WITHOUT REPLIED YOUR FRIEND JACQUES COICTIER HE WENT TO
OPEN THE DOOR
IT WAS IN FACT THE KING'S PHYSICIAN A PERSON ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF
AGE WHOSE HARSH PHYSIOGNOMY WAS MODIFIED ONLY BY A CRAFTY EYE
ANOTHER
MAN ACCOMPANIED HIM
BOTH WORE LONG SLATE COLORED ROBES FURRED WITH
MINEVER GIRDED AND CLOSED WITH CAPS OF THE SAME STUFF AND HUE
THEIR
HANDS WERE CONCEALED BY THEIR SLEEVES THEIR FEET BY THEIR ROBES THEIR
EYES BY THEIR CAPS
GOD HELP ME MESSIEURS SAID THE ARCHDEACON SHOWING THEM IN I
WAS NOT EXPECTING DISTINGUISHED VISITORS AT SUCH AN HOUR AND WHILE
SPEAKING IN THIS COURTEOUS FASHION HE CAST AN UNEASY AND SCRUTINIZING
GLANCE FROM THE PHYSICIAN TO HIS COMPANION
'TIS NEVER TOO LATE TO COME AND PAY A VISIT TO SO CONSIDERABLE
A LEARNED MAN AS DOM CLAUDE FROLLO DE TIRECHAPPE REPLIED DOCTOR
COICTIER WHOSE FRANCHE COMT ACCENT MADE ALL HIS PHRASES DRAG ALONG
WITH THE MAJESTY OF A TRAIN ROBE
THERE THEN ENSUED BETWEEN THE PHYSICIAN AND THE ARCHDEACON ONE OF THOSE
CONGRATULATORY PROLOGUES WHICH IN ACCORDANCE WITH CUSTOM AT THAT
EPOCH PRECEDED ALL CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN LEARNED MEN AND WHICH DID NOT
PREVENT THEM FROM DETESTING EACH OTHER IN THE MOST CORDIAL MANNER IN
THE WORLD
HOWEVER IT IS THE SAME NOWADAYS EVERY WISE MAN'S MOUTH
COMPLIMENTING ANOTHER WISE MAN IS A VASE OF HONEYED GALL
CLAUDE FROLLO'S FELICITATIONS TO JACQUES COICTIER BORE REFERENCE
PRINCIPALLY TO THE TEMPORAL ADVANTAGES WHICH THE WORTHY PHYSICIAN HAD
FOUND MEANS TO EXTRACT IN THE COURSE OF HIS MUCH ENVIED CAREER FROM
EACH MALADY OF THE KING AN OPERATION OF ALCHEMY MUCH BETTER AND MORE
CERTAIN THAN THE PURSUIT OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
IN TRUTH MONSIEUR LE DOCTEUR COICTIER I FELT GREAT JOY ON LEARNING OF
THE BISHOPRIC GIVEN YOUR NEPHEW MY REVEREND SEIGNEUR PIERRE VERSE
IS
HE NOT BISHOP OF AMIENS
YES MONSIEUR ARCHDEACON IT IS A GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU MADE A GREAT FIGURE ON CHRISTMAS DAY AT THE BEAD
OF YOUR COMPANY OF THE CHAMBER OF ACCOUNTS MONSIEUR PRESIDENT
VICE PRESIDENT DOM CLAUDE
ALAS NOTHING MORE
HOW IS YOUR SUPERB HOUSE IN THE RUE SAINT ANDR DES ARCS COMING ON
'TIS A LOUVRE
I LOVE GREATLY THE APRICOT TREE WHICH IS CARVED ON THE
DOOR WITH THIS PLAY OF WORDS 'A L'ABRI COTIER SHELTERED FROM REEFS
ALAS MASTER CLAUDE ALL THAT MASONRY COSTETH ME DEAR
IN PROPORTION AS
THE HOUSE IS ERECTED I AM RUINED
HO HAVE YOU NOT YOUR REVENUES FROM THE JAIL AND THE BAILIWICK OF THE
PALAIS AND THE RENTS OF ALL THE HOUSES SHEDS STALLS AND BOOTHS OF
THE ENCLOSURE 'TIS A FINE BREAST TO SUCK
MY CASTELLANY OF POISSY HAS BROUGHT ME IN NOTHING THIS YEAR
BUT YOUR TOLLS OF TRIEL OF SAINT JAMES OF SAINT GERMAINEN LAYE ARE
ALWAYS GOOD
SIX SCORE LIVRES AND NOT EVEN PARISIAN LIVRES AT THAT
YOU HAVE YOUR OFFICE OF COUNSELLOR TO THE KING
THAT IS FIXED
YES BROTHER CLAUDE BUT THAT ACCURSED SEIGNEURY OF POLIGNY WHICH
PEOPLE MAKE SO MUCH NOISE ABOUT IS WORTH NOT SIXTY GOLD CROWNS YEAR
OUT AND YEAR IN
IN THE COMPLIMENTS WHICH DOM CLAUDE ADDRESSED TO JACQUES COICTIER THERE
WAS THAT SARDONICAL BITING AND COVERTLY MOCKING ACCENT AND THE SAD
CRUEL SMILE OF A SUPERIOR AND UNHAPPY MAN WHO TOYS FOR A MOMENT BY WAY
OF DISTRACTION WITH THE DENSE PROSPERITY OF A VULGAR MAN
THE OTHER DID
NOT PERCEIVE IT
UPON MY SOUL SAID CLAUDE AT LENGTH PRESSING HIS HAND I AM GLAD TO
SEE YOU AND IN SUCH GOOD HEALTH
THANKS MASTER CLAUDE
BY THE WAY EXCLAIMED DOM CLAUDE HOW IS YOUR ROYAL PATIENT
HE PAYETH NOT SUFFICIENTLY HIS PHYSICIAN REPLIED THE DOCTOR CASTING
A SIDE GLANCE AT HIS COMPANION
THINK YOU SO GOSSIP COICTIER SAID THE LATTER
THESE WORDS UTTERED IN A TONE OF SURPRISE AND REPROACH DREW UPON THIS
UNKNOWN PERSONAGE THE ATTENTION OF THE ARCHDEACON WHICH TO TELL THE
TRUTH HAD NOT BEEN DIVERTED FROM HIM A SINGLE MOMENT SINCE THE STRANGER
HAD SET FOOT ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS CELL
IT HAD EVEN REQUIRED ALL
THE THOUSAND REASONS WHICH HE HAD FOR HANDLING TENDERLY DOCTOR JACQUES
COICTIER THE ALL POWERFUL PHYSICIAN OF KING LOUIS XI TO INDUCE HIM
TO RECEIVE THE LATTER THUS ACCOMPANIED
HENCE THERE WAS NOTHING VERY
CORDIAL IN HIS MANNER WHEN JACQUES COICTIER SAID TO HIM
BY THE WAY DOM CLAUDE I BRING YOU A COLLEAGUE WHO HAS DESIRED TO SEE
YOU ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR REPUTATION
MONSIEUR BELONGS TO SCIENCE ASKED THE ARCHDEACON FIXING HIS PIERCING
EYE UPON COICTIER'S COMPANION
HE FOUND BENEATH THE BROWS OF THE
STRANGER A GLANCE NO LESS PIERCING OR LESS DISTRUSTFUL THAN HIS OWN
HE WAS SO FAR AS THE FEEBLE LIGHT OF THE LAMP PERMITTED ONE TO JUDGE
AN OLD MAN ABOUT SIXTY YEARS OF AGE AND OF MEDIUM STATURE WHO APPEARED
SOMEWHAT SICKLY AND BROKEN IN HEALTH
HIS PROFILE ALTHOUGH OF A VERY
ORDINARY OUTLINE HAD SOMETHING POWERFUL AND SEVERE ABOUT IT HIS EYES
SPARKLED BENEATH A VERY DEEP SUPERCILIARY ARCH LIKE A LIGHT IN THE
DEPTHS OF A CAVE AND BENEATH HIS CAP WHICH WAS WELL DRAWN DOWN AND FELL
UPON HIS NOSE ONE RECOGNIZED THE BROAD EXPANSE OF A BROW OF GENIUS
HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO REPLY TO THE ARCHDEACON'S QUESTION
REVEREND MASTER HE SAID IN A GRAVE TONE YOUR RENOWN HAS REACHED MY
EARS AND I WISH TO CONSULT YOU
I AM BUT A POOR PROVINCIAL GENTLEMAN
WHO REMOVETH HIS SHOES BEFORE ENTERING THE DWELLINGS OF THE LEARNED
YOU
MUST KNOW MY NAME
I AM CALLED GOSSIP TOURANGEAU
STRANGE NAME FOR A GENTLEMAN SAID THE ARCHDEACON TO HIMSELF
NEVERTHELESS HE HAD A FEELING THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRONG
AND EARNEST CHARACTER
THE INSTINCT OF HIS OWN LOFTY INTELLECT MADE HIM
RECOGNIZE AN INTELLECT NO LESS LOFTY UNDER GOSSIP TOURANGEAU'S FURRED
CAP AND AS HE GAZED AT THE SOLEMN FACE THE IRONICAL SMILE WHICH
JACQUES COICTIER'S PRESENCE CALLED FORTH ON HIS GLOOMY FACE GRADUALLY
DISAPPEARED AS TWILIGHT FADES ON THE HORIZON OF NIGHT
STERN AND SILENT
HE HAD RESUMED HIS SEAT IN HIS GREAT ARMCHAIR HIS ELBOW RESTED AS
USUAL ON THE TABLE AND HIS BROW ON HIS HAND
AFTER A FEW MOMENTS
OF REFLECTION HE MOTIONED HIS VISITORS TO BE SEATED AND TURNING TO
GOSSIP TOURANGEAU HE SAID
YOU COME TO CONSULT ME MASTER AND UPON WHAT SCIENCE
YOUR REVERENCE REPLIED TOURANGEAU I AM ILL VERY ILL
YOU ARE SAID
TO BE GREAT AESCULAPIUS AND I AM COME TO ASK YOUR ADVICE IN MEDICINE
MEDICINE SAID THE ARCHDEACON TOSSING HIS HEAD
HE SEEMED TO MEDITATE
FOR A MOMENT AND THEN RESUMED GOSSIP TOURANGEAU SINCE THAT IS YOUR
NAME TURN YOUR HEAD YOU WILL FIND MY REPLY ALREADY WRITTEN ON THE
WALL
GOSSIP TOURANGEAU OBEYED AND READ THIS INSCRIPTION ENGRAVED ABOVE HIS
HEAD MEDICINE IS THE DAUGHTER OF DREAMS JAMBLIQUE
MEANWHILE DOCTOR JACQUES COICTIER HAD HEARD HIS COMPANION'S QUESTION
WITH A DISPLEASURE WHICH DOM CLAUDE'S RESPONSE HAD BUT REDOUBLED
HE
BENT DOWN TO THE EAR OF GOSSIP TOURANGEAU AND SAID TO HIM SOFTLY
ENOUGH NOT TO BE HEARD BY THE ARCHDEACON I WARNED YOU THAT HE WAS MAD
YOU INSISTED ON SEEING HIM
'TIS VERY POSSIBLE THAT HE IS RIGHT MADMAN AS HE IS DOCTOR JACQUES
REPLIED HIS COMRADE IN THE SAME LOW TONE AND WITH A BITTER SMILE
AS YOU PLEASE REPLIED COICTIER DRYLY
THEN ADDRESSING THE
ARCHDEACON YOU ARE CLEVER AT YOUR TRADE DOM CLAUDE AND YOU ARE NO
MORE AT A LOSS OVER HIPPOCRATES THAN A MONKEY IS OVER A NUT
MEDICINE
A DREAM I SUSPECT THAT THE PHARMACOPOLISTS AND THE MASTER PHYSICIANS
WOULD INSIST UPON STONING YOU IF THEY WERE HERE
SO YOU DENY THE
INFLUENCE OF PHILTRES UPON THE BLOOD AND UNGUENTS ON THE SKIN YOU DENY
THAT ETERNAL PHARMACY OF FLOWERS AND METALS WHICH IS CALLED THE WORLD
MADE EXPRESSLY FOR THAT ETERNAL INVALID CALLED MAN
I DENY SAID DOM CLAUDE COLDLY NEITHER PHARMACY NOR THE INVALID
I
REJECT THE PHYSICIAN
THEN IT IS NOT TRUE RESUMED COICTIER HOTLY THAT GOUT IS AN INTERNAL
ERUPTION THAT A WOUND CAUSED BY ARTILLERY IS TO BE CURED BY THE
APPLICATION OF A YOUNG MOUSE ROASTED THAT YOUNG BLOOD PROPERLY
INJECTED RESTORES YOUTH TO AGED VEINS IT IS NOT TRUE THAT TWO AND TWO
MAKE FOUR AND THAT EMPROSTATHONOS FOLLOWS OPISTATHONOS
THE ARCHDEACON REPLIED WITHOUT PERTURBATION THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
OF WHICH I THINK IN A CERTAIN FASHION
COICTIER BECAME CRIMSON WITH ANGER
THERE THERE MY GOOD COICTIER LET US NOT GET ANGRY SAID GOSSIP
TOURANGEAU
MONSIEUR THE ARCHDEACON IS OUR FRIEND
COICTIER CALMED DOWN MUTTERING IN A LOW TONE
AFTER ALL HE'S MAD
PASQUE DIEU MASTER CLAUDE RESUMED GOSSIP TOURANGEAU AFTER A
SILENCE YOU EMBARRASS ME GREATLY
I HAD TWO THINGS TO CONSULT YOU
UPON ONE TOUCHING MY HEALTH AND THE OTHER TOUCHING MY STAR
MONSIEUR RETURNED THE ARCHDEACON IF THAT BE YOUR MOTIVE YOU
WOULD HAVE DONE AS WELL NOT TO PUT YOURSELF OUT OF BREATH CLIMBING MY
STAIRCASE
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN MEDICINE
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN ASTROLOGY
INDEED SAID THE MAN WITH SURPRISE
COICTIER GAVE A FORCED LAUGH
YOU SEE THAT HE IS MAD HE SAID IN A LOW TONE TO GOSSIP TOURANGEAU
HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN ASTROLOGY
THE IDEA OF IMAGINING PURSUED DOM CLAUDE THAT EVERY RAY OF A STAR
IS A THREAD WHICH IS FASTENED TO THE HEAD OF A MAN
AND WHAT THEN DO YOU BELIEVE IN EXCLAIMED GOSSIP TOURANGEAU
THE ARCHDEACON HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THEN HE ALLOWED A GLOOMY SMILE TO
ESCAPE WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE LIE TO HIS RESPONSE CREDO IN DEUM
DOMINUM NOSTRUM ADDED GOSSIP TOURANGEAU MAKING THE SIGN OF THE
CROSS
AMEN SAID COICTIER
REVEREND MASTER RESUMED TOURANGEAU I AM CHARMED IN SOUL TO SEE YOU
IN SUCH A RELIGIOUS FRAME OF MIND
BUT HAVE YOU REACHED THE POINT GREAT
SAVANT AS YOU ARE OF NO LONGER BELIEVING IN SCIENCE
NO SAID THE ARCHDEACON GRASPING THE ARM OF GOSSIP TOURANGEAU AND
A RAY OF ENTHUSIASM LIGHTED UP HIS GLOOMY EYES NO I DO NOT REJECT
SCIENCE
I HAVE NOT CRAWLED SO LONG FLAT ON MY BELLY WITH MY NAILS IN
THE EARTH THROUGH THE INNUMERABLE RAMIFICATIONS OF ITS CAVERNS WITHOUT
PERCEIVING FAR IN FRONT OF ME AT THE END OF THE OBSCURE GALLERY A
LIGHT A FLAME A SOMETHING THE REFLECTION NO DOUBT OF THE DAZZLING
CENTRAL LABORATORY WHERE THE PATIENT AND THE WISE HAVE FOUND OUT GOD
AND IN SHORT INTERRUPTED TOURANGEAU WHAT DO YOU HOLD TO BE TRUE AND
CERTAIN
ALCHEMY
COICTIER EXCLAIMED PARDIEU DOM CLAUDE ALCHEMY HAS ITS USE NO DOUBT
BUT WHY BLASPHEME MEDICINE AND ASTROLOGY
NAUGHT IS YOUR SCIENCE OF MAN NAUGHT IS YOUR SCIENCE OF THE STARS
SAID THE ARCHDEACON COMMANDINGLY
THAT'S DRIVING EPIDAURUS AND CHALDEA VERY FAST REPLIED THE PHYSICIAN
WITH A GRIN
LISTEN MESSIRE JACQUES
THIS IS SAID IN GOOD FAITH
I AM NOT THE
KING'S PHYSICIAN AND HIS MAJESTY HAS NOT GIVEN ME THE GARDEN OF
DAEDALUS IN WHICH TO OBSERVE THE CONSTELLATIONS
DON'T GET ANGRY BUT
LISTEN TO ME
WHAT TRUTH HAVE YOU DEDUCED I WILL NOT SAY FROM MEDICINE
WHICH IS TOO FOOLISH A THING BUT FROM ASTROLOGY CITE TO ME THE VIRTUES
OF THE VERTICAL BOUSTROPHEDON THE TREASURES OF THE NUMBER ZIRUPH AND
THOSE OF THE NUMBER ZEPHIROD
WILL YOU DENY SAID COICTIER THE SYMPATHETIC FORCE OF THE COLLAR
BONE AND THE CABALISTICS WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM IT
AN ERROR MESSIRE JACQUES NONE OF YOUR FORMULAS END IN REALITY
ALCHEMY ON THE OTHER HAND HAS ITS DISCOVERIES
WILL YOU CONTEST RESULTS
LIKE THIS ICE CONFINED BENEATH THE EARTH FOR A THOUSAND YEARS IS
TRANSFORMED INTO ROCK CRYSTALS
LEAD IS THE ANCESTOR OF ALL METALS
FOR
GOLD IS NOT A METAL GOLD IS LIGHT
LEAD REQUIRES ONLY FOUR PERIODS OF
TWO HUNDRED YEARS EACH TO PASS IN SUCCESSION FROM THE STATE OF LEAD TO
THE STATE OF RED ARSENIC FROM RED ARSENIC TO TIN FROM TIN TO SILVER
ARE NOT THESE FACTS BUT TO BELIEVE IN THE COLLAR BONE IN THE FULL LINE
AND IN THE STARS IS AS RIDICULOUS AS TO BELIEVE WITH THE INHABITANTS OF
GRAND CATHAY THAT THE GOLDEN ORIOLE TURNS INTO A MOLE AND THAT GRAINS
OF WHEAT TURN INTO FISH OF THE CARP SPECIES
I HAVE STUDIED HERMETIC SCIENCE EXCLAIMED COICTIER AND I AFFIRM
THE FIERY ARCHDEACON DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO FINISH AND I HAVE STUDIED
MEDICINE ASTROLOGY AND HERMETICS
HERE ALONE IS THE TRUTH AS HE
SPOKE THUS HE TOOK FROM THE TOP OF THE COFFER A PHIAL FILLED WITH THE
POWDER WHICH WE HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE HERE ALONE IS LIGHT HIPPOCRATES
IS A DREAM URANIA IS A DREAM HERMES A THOUGHT
GOLD IS THE SUN TO
MAKE GOLD IS TO BE GOD
HEREIN LIES THE ONE AND ONLY SCIENCE
I HAVE
SOUNDED THE DEPTHS OF MEDICINE AND ASTROLOGY I TELL YOU NAUGHT
NOTHINGNESS THE HUMAN BODY SHADOWS THE PLANETS SHADOWS
AND HE FELL BACK IN HIS ARMCHAIR IN A COMMANDING AND INSPIRED ATTITUDE
GOSSIP TOURAUGEAU WATCHED HIM IN SILENCE
COICTIER TRIED TO GRIN
SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IMPERCEPTIBLY AND REPEATED IN A LOW VOICE
A MADMAN
AND SAID TOURANGEAU SUDDENLY THE WONDROUS RESULT HAVE YOU
ATTAINED IT HAVE YOU MADE GOLD
IF I HAD MADE IT REPLIED THE ARCHDEACON ARTICULATING HIS WORDS
SLOWLY LIKE A MAN WHO IS REFLECTING THE KING OF FRANCE WOULD BE NAMED
CLAUDE AND NOT LOUIS
THE STRANGER FROWNED
WHAT AM I SAYING RESUMED DOM CLAUDE WITH A SMILE OF DISDAIN
WHAT
WOULD THE THRONE OF FRANCE BE TO ME WHEN I COULD REBUILD THE EMPIRE OF
THE ORIENT
VERY GOOD SAID THE STRANGER
OH THE POOR FOOL MURMURED COICTIER
THE ARCHDEACON WENT ON APPEARING TO REPLY NOW ONLY TO HIS THOUGHTS
BUT NO I AM STILL CRAWLING I AM SCRATCHING MY FACE AND KNEES AGAINST
THE PEBBLES OF THE SUBTERRANEAN PATHWAY
I CATCH A GLIMPSE I DO NOT
CONTEMPLATE I DO NOT READ I SPELL OUT
AND WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO READ DEMANDED THE STRANGER WILL YOU MAKE
GOLD
WHO DOUBTS IT SAID THE ARCHDEACON
IN THAT CASE OUR LADY KNOWS THAT I AM GREATLY IN NEED OF MONEY AND I
SHOULD MUCH DESIRE TO READ IN YOUR BOOKS
TELL ME REVEREND MASTER IS
YOUR SCIENCE INIMICAL OR DISPLEASING TO OUR LADY
WHOSE ARCHDEACON I AM DOM CLAUDE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH REPLYING
WITH TRANQUIL HAUTEUR
THAT IS TRUE MY MASTER
WELL WILL IT PLEASE YOU TO INITIATE ME LET
ME SPELL WITH YOU
CLAUDE ASSUMED THE MAJESTIC AND PONTIFICAL ATTITUDE OF A SAMUEL
OLD MAN IT REQUIRES LONGER YEARS THAN REMAIN TO YOU TO UNDERTAKE THIS
VOYAGE ACROSS MYSTERIOUS THINGS
YOUR HEAD IS VERY GRAY ONE COMES FORTH
FROM THE CAVERN ONLY WITH WHITE HAIR BUT ONLY THOSE WITH DARK HAIR
ENTER IT
SCIENCE ALONE KNOWS WELL HOW TO HOLLOW WITHER AND DRY UP
HUMAN FACES SHE NEEDS NOT TO HAVE OLD AGE BRING HER FACES ALREADY
FURROWED
NEVERTHELESS IF THE DESIRE POSSESSES YOU OF PUTTING YOURSELF
UNDER DISCIPLINE AT YOUR AGE AND OF DECIPHERING THE FORMIDABLE ALPHABET
OF THE SAGES COME TO ME 'TIS WELL I WILL MAKE THE EFFORT
I WILL NOT
TELL YOU POOR OLD MAN TO GO AND VISIT THE SEPULCHRAL CHAMBERS OF THE
PYRAMIDS OF WHICH ANCIENT HERODOTUS SPEAKS NOR THE BRICK TOWER OF
BABYLON NOR THE IMMENSE WHITE MARBLE SANCTUARY OF THE INDIAN TEMPLE OF
EKLINGA
I NO MORE THAN YOURSELF HAVE SEEN THE CHALDEAN MASONRY WORKS
CONSTRUCTED ACCORDING TO THE SACRED FORM OF THE SIKRA NOR THE TEMPLE OF
SOLOMON WHICH IS DESTROYED NOR THE STONE DOORS OF THE SEPULCHRE OF THE
KINGS OF ISRAEL WHICH ARE BROKEN
WE WILL CONTENT OURSELVES WITH THE
FRAGMENTS OF THE BOOK OF HERMES WHICH WE HAVE HERE
I WILL EXPLAIN TO
YOU THE STATUE OF SAINT CHRISTOPHER THE SYMBOL OF THE SOWER AND THAT
OF THE TWO ANGELS WHICH ARE ON THE FRONT OF THE SAINTE CHAPELLE AND ONE
OF WHICH HOLDS IN HIS HANDS A VASE THE OTHER A CLOUD
HERE JACQUES COICTIER WHO HAD BEEN UNHORSED BY THE ARCHDEACON'S
IMPETUOUS REPLIES REGAINED HIS SADDLE AND INTERRUPTED HIM WITH THE
TRIUMPHANT TONE OF ONE LEARNED MAN CORRECTING ANOTHER ERRAS AMICE
CLAUDI
THE SYMBOL IS NOT THE NUMBER
YOU TAKE ORPHEUS FOR HERMES
'TIS YOU WHO ARE IN ERROR REPLIED THE ARCHDEACON GRAVELY
DAEDALUS
IS THE BASE ORPHEUS IS THE WALL HERMES IS THE EDIFICE THAT IS ALL
YOU SHALL COME WHEN YOU WILL HE CONTINUED TURNING TO TOURANGEAU I
WILL SHOW YOU THE LITTLE PARCELS OF GOLD WHICH REMAINED AT THE BOTTOM OF
NICHOLAS FLAMEL'S ALEMBIC AND YOU SHALL COMPARE THEM WITH THE GOLD OF
GUILLAUME DE PARIS
I WILL TEACH YOU THE SECRET VIRTUES OF THE GREEK
WORD PERISTERA
BUT FIRST OF ALL I WILL MAKE YOU READ ONE AFTER
THE OTHER THE MARBLE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET THE GRANITE PAGES OF THE
BOOK
WE SHALL GO TO THE PORTAL OF BISHOP GUILLAUME AND OF SAINT JEAN LE
ROND AT THE SAINTE CHAPELLE THEN TO THE HOUSE OF NICHOLAS FLAMEL RUE
MANVAULT TO HIS TOMB WHICH IS AT THE SAINTS INNOCENTS TO HIS TWO
HOSPITALS RUE DE MONTMORENCY
I WILL MAKE YOU READ THE HIEROGLYPHICS
WHICH COVER THE FOUR GREAT IRON CRAMPS ON THE PORTAL OF THE HOSPITAL
SAINT GERVAIS AND OF THE RUE DE LA FERRONNERIE
WE WILL
SPELL OUT IN COMPANY ALSO THE FAADE OF SAINT COME OF
SAINTE GENEVIVE DES ARDENTS OF SAINT MARTIN OF SAINT JACQUES
DE LA BOUCHERIE
FOR A LONG TIME GOSSIP TOURANGEAU INTELLIGENT AS WAS HIS GLANCE HAD
APPEARED NOT TO UNDERSTAND DOM CLAUDE
HE INTERRUPTED
PASQUE DIEU WHAT ARE YOUR BOOKS THEN
HERE IS ONE OF THEM SAID THE ARCHDEACON
AND OPENING THE WINDOW OF HIS CELL HE POINTED OUT WITH HIS FINGER THE
IMMENSE CHURCH OF NOTRE DAME WHICH OUTLINING AGAINST THE STARRY SKY
THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF ITS TWO TOWERS ITS STONE FLANKS ITS MONSTROUS
HAUNCHES SEEMED AN ENORMOUS TWO HEADED SPHINX SEATED IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE CITY
THE ARCHDEACON GAZED AT THE GIGANTIC EDIFICE FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE
THEN EXTENDING HIS RIGHT HAND WITH A SIGH TOWARDS THE PRINTED BOOK
WHICH LAY OPEN ON THE TABLE AND HIS LEFT TOWARDS NOTRE DAME AND
TURNING A SAD GLANCE FROM THE BOOK TO THE CHURCH ALAS HE SAID
THIS WILL KILL THAT
COICTIER WHO HAD EAGERLY APPROACHED THE BOOK COULD NOT REPRESS AN
EXCLAMATION
H BUT NOW WHAT IS THERE SO FORMIDABLE IN THIS 'GLOSSA
IN EPISTOLAS D
PAULI NORIMBERGOE ANTONIUS KOBURGER 1474 THIS IS
NOT NEW
'TIS A BOOK OF PIERRE LOMBARD THE MASTER OF SENTENCES
IS IT
BECAUSE IT IS PRINTED
YOU HAVE SAID IT REPLIED CLAUDE WHO SEEMED ABSORBED IN A PROFOUND
MEDITATION AND STOOD RESTING HIS FOREFINGER BENT BACKWARD ON THE FOLIO
WHICH HAD COME FROM THE FAMOUS PRESS OF NUREMBERG
THEN HE ADDED THESE
MYSTERIOUS WORDS ALAS ALAS SMALL THINGS COME AT THE END OF GREAT
THINGS A TOOTH TRIUMPHS OVER A MASS
THE NILE RAT KILLS THE CROCODILE
THE SWORDFISH KILLS THE WHALE THE BOOK WILL KILL THE EDIFICE
THE CURFEW OF THE CLOISTER SOUNDED AT THE MOMENT WHEN MASTER JACQUES
WAS REPEATING TO HIS COMPANION IN LOW TONES HIS ETERNAL REFRAIN HE IS
MAD TO WHICH HIS COMPANION THIS TIME REPLIED I BELIEVE THAT HE IS
IT WAS THE HOUR WHEN NO STRANGER COULD REMAIN IN THE CLOISTER
THE TWO
VISITORS WITHDREW
MASTER SAID GOSSIP TOURANGEAU AS HE TOOK LEAVE
OF THE ARCHDEACON I LOVE WISE MEN AND GREAT MINDS AND I HOLD YOU
IN SINGULAR ESTEEM
COME TO MORROW TO THE PALACE DES TOURNELLES AND
INQUIRE FOR THE ABB DE SAINTE MARTIN OF TOURS
THE ARCHDEACON RETURNED TO HIS CHAMBER DUMBFOUNDED COMPREHENDING
AT LAST WHO GOSSIP TOURANGEAU WAS AND RECALLING THAT PASSAGE OF THE
REGISTER OF SAINTE MARTIN OF TOURS ABBAS BEATI MARTINI SCILICET REX
FRANCIAE EST CANONICUS DE CONSUETUDINE ET HABET PARVAM PROEBENDAM QUAM
HABET SANCTUS VENANTIUS ET DEBET SEDERE IN SEDE THESAURARII
IT IS ASSERTED THAT AFTER THAT EPOCH THE ARCHDEACON HAD FREQUENT
CONFERENCES WITH LOUIS XI WHEN HIS MAJESTY CAME TO PARIS AND THAT
DOM CLAUDE'S INFLUENCE QUITE OVERSHADOWED THAT OF OLIVIER LE DAIM AND
JACQUES COICTIER WHO AS WAS HIS HABIT RUDELY TOOK THE KING TO TASK ON
THAT ACCOUNT
CHAPTER II
THIS WILL KILL THAT
OUR LADY READERS WILL PARDON US IF WE PAUSE FOR A MOMENT TO SEEK WHAT
COULD HAVE BEEN THE THOUGHT CONCEALED BENEATH THOSE ENIGMATIC WORDS OF
THE ARCHDEACON THIS WILL KILL THAT
THE BOOK WILL KILL THE EDIFICE
TO OUR MIND THIS THOUGHT HAD TWO FACES
IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS A
PRIESTLY THOUGHT
IT WAS THE AFFRIGHT OF THE PRIEST IN THE PRESENCE OF
A NEW AGENT THE PRINTING PRESS
IT WAS THE TERROR AND DAZZLED AMAZEMENT
OF THE MEN OF THE SANCTUARY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LUMINOUS PRESS OF
GUTENBERG
IT WAS THE PULPIT AND THE MANUSCRIPT TAKING THE ALARM AT THE
PRINTED WORD SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE STUPOR OF A SPARROW WHICH SHOULD
BEHOLD THE ANGEL LEGION UNFOLD HIS SIX MILLION WINGS
IT WAS THE CRY OF
THE PROPHET WHO ALREADY HEARS EMANCIPATED HUMANITY ROARING AND
SWARMING WHO BEHOLDS IN THE FUTURE INTELLIGENCE SAPPING FAITH
OPINION DETHRONING BELIEF THE WORLD SHAKING OFF ROME
IT WAS THE
PROGNOSTICATION OF THE PHILOSOPHER WHO SEES HUMAN THOUGHT VOLATILIZED
BY THE PRESS EVAPORATING FROM THE THEOCRATIC RECIPIENT
IT WAS THE
TERROR OF THE SOLDIER WHO EXAMINES THE BRAZEN BATTERING RAM AND
SAYS THE TOWER WILL CRUMBLE IT SIGNIFIED THAT ONE POWER WAS ABOUT
TO SUCCEED ANOTHER POWER
IT MEANT THE PRESS WILL KILL THE CHURCH
BUT UNDERLYING THIS THOUGHT THE FIRST AND MOST SIMPLE ONE NO DOUBT
THERE WAS IN OUR OPINION ANOTHER NEWER ONE A COROLLARY OF THE FIRST
LESS EASY TO PERCEIVE AND MORE EASY TO CONTEST A VIEW AS PHILOSOPHICAL
AND BELONGING NO LONGER TO THE PRIEST ALONE BUT TO THE SAVANT AND THE
ARTIST
IT WAS A PRESENTIMENT THAT HUMAN THOUGHT IN CHANGING ITS FORM
WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE ITS MODE OF EXPRESSION THAT THE DOMINANT IDEA OF
EACH GENERATION WOULD NO LONGER BE WRITTEN WITH THE SAME MATTER AND IN
THE SAME MANNER THAT THE BOOK OF STONE SO SOLID AND SO DURABLE WAS
ABOUT TO MAKE WAY FOR THE BOOK OF PAPER MORE SOLID AND STILL MORE
DURABLE
IN THIS CONNECTION THE ARCHDEACON'S VAGUE FORMULA HAD A SECOND
SENSE
IT MEANT PRINTING WILL KILL ARCHITECTURE
IN FACT FROM THE ORIGIN OF THINGS DOWN TO THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY OF THE
CHRISTIAN ERA INCLUSIVE ARCHITECTURE IS THE GREAT BOOK OF HUMANITY
THE PRINCIPAL EXPRESSION OF MAN IN HIS DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT
EITHER AS A FORCE OR AS AN INTELLIGENCE
WHEN THE MEMORY OF THE FIRST RACES FELT ITSELF OVERLOADED WHEN THE MASS
OF REMINISCENCES OF THE HUMAN RACE BECAME SO HEAVY AND SO CONFUSED THAT
SPEECH NAKED AND FLYING RAN THE RISK OF LOSING THEM ON THE WAY MEN
TRANSCRIBED THEM ON THE SOIL IN A MANNER WHICH WAS AT ONCE THE MOST
VISIBLE MOST DURABLE AND MOST NATURAL
THEY SEALED EACH TRADITION
BENEATH A MONUMENT
THE FIRST MONUMENTS WERE SIMPLE MASSES OF ROCK WHICH THE IRON HAD NOT
TOUCHED AS MOSES SAYS
ARCHITECTURE BEGAN LIKE ALL WRITING
IT WAS
FIRST AN ALPHABET
MEN PLANTED A STONE UPRIGHT IT WAS A LETTER AND
EACH LETTER WAS A HIEROGLYPH AND UPON EACH HIEROGLYPH RESTED A GROUP OF
IDEAS LIKE THE CAPITAL ON THE COLUMN
THIS IS WHAT THE EARLIEST RACES
DID EVERYWHERE AT THE SAME MOMENT ON THE SURFACE OF THE ENTIRE WORLD
WE FIND THE STANDING STONES OF THE CELTS IN ASIAN SIBERIA IN THE
PAMPAS OF AMERICA
LATER ON THEY MADE WORDS THEY PLACED STONE UPON STONE THEY COUPLED
THOSE SYLLABLES OF GRANITE AND ATTEMPTED SOME COMBINATIONS
THE CELTIC
DOLMEN AND CROMLECH THE ETRUSCAN TUMULUS THE HEBREW GALGAL ARE WORDS
SOME ESPECIALLY THE TUMULUS ARE PROPER NAMES
SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN MEN
HAD A GREAT DEAL OF STONE AND A VAST PLAIN THEY WROTE A PHRASE
THE
IMMENSE PILE OF KARNAC IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE
AT LAST THEY MADE BOOKS
TRADITIONS HAD BROUGHT FORTH SYMBOLS BENEATH
WHICH THEY DISAPPEARED LIKE THE TRUNK OF A TREE BENEATH ITS FOLIAGE
ALL THESE SYMBOLS IN WHICH HUMANITY PLACED FAITH CONTINUED TO GROW TO
MULTIPLY TO INTERSECT TO BECOME MORE AND MORE COMPLICATED THE FIRST
MONUMENTS NO LONGER SUFFICED TO CONTAIN THEM THEY WERE OVERFLOWING
IN EVERY PART THESE MONUMENTS HARDLY EXPRESSED NOW THE PRIMITIVE
TRADITION SIMPLE LIKE THEMSELVES NAKED AND PRONE UPON THE EARTH
THE
SYMBOL FELT THE NEED OF EXPANSION IN THE EDIFICE
THEN ARCHITECTURE WAS
DEVELOPED IN PROPORTION WITH HUMAN THOUGHT IT BECAME A GIANT WITH
A THOUSAND HEADS AND A THOUSAND ARMS AND FIXED ALL THIS FLOATING
SYMBOLISM IN AN ETERNAL VISIBLE PALPABLE FORM
WHILE DAEDALUS WHO IS
FORCE MEASURED WHILE ORPHEUS WHO IS INTELLIGENCE SANG THE PILLAR
WHICH IS A LETTER THE ARCADE WHICH IS A SYLLABLE THE PYRAMID WHICH
IS A WORD ALL SET IN MOVEMENT AT ONCE BY A LAW OF GEOMETRY AND BY A
LAW OF POETRY GROUPED THEMSELVES COMBINED AMALGAMATED DESCENDED
ASCENDED PLACED THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE ON THE SOIL RANGED THEMSELVES
IN STORIES IN THE SKY UNTIL THEY HAD WRITTEN UNDER THE DICTATION OF
THE GENERAL IDEA OF AN EPOCH THOSE MARVELLOUS BOOKS WHICH WERE ALSO
MARVELLOUS EDIFICES THE PAGODA OF EKLINGA THE RHAMSEION OF EGYPT THE
TEMPLE OF SOLOMON
THE GENERATING IDEA THE WORD WAS NOT ONLY AT THE FOUNDATION OF
ALL THESE EDIFICES BUT ALSO IN THE FORM
THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON FOR
EXAMPLE WAS NOT ALONE THE BINDING OF THE HOLY BOOK IT WAS THE HOLY
BOOK ITSELF
ON EACH ONE OF ITS CONCENTRIC WALLS THE PRIESTS COULD READ
THE WORD TRANSLATED AND MANIFESTED TO THE EYE AND THUS THEY FOLLOWED
ITS TRANSFORMATIONS FROM SANCTUARY TO SANCTUARY UNTIL THEY SEIZED IT IN
ITS LAST TABERNACLE UNDER ITS MOST CONCRETE FORM WHICH STILL BELONGED
TO ARCHITECTURE THE ARCH
THUS THE WORD WAS ENCLOSED IN AN EDIFICE BUT
ITS IMAGE WAS UPON ITS ENVELOPE LIKE THE HUMAN FORM ON THE COFFIN OF A
MUMMY
AND NOT ONLY THE FORM OF EDIFICES BUT THE SITES SELECTED FOR THEM
REVEALED THE THOUGHT WHICH THEY REPRESENTED ACCORDING AS THE SYMBOL TO
BE EXPRESSED WAS GRACEFUL OR GRAVE
GREECE CROWNED HER MOUNTAINS WITH
A TEMPLE HARMONIOUS TO THE EYE INDIA DISEMBOWELLED HERS TO CHISEL
THEREIN THOSE MONSTROUS SUBTERRANEAN PAGODAS BORNE UP BY GIGANTIC ROWS
OF GRANITE ELEPHANTS
THUS DURING THE FIRST SIX THOUSAND YEARS OF THE WORLD FROM THE
MOST IMMEMORIAL PAGODA OF HINDUSTAN TO THE CATHEDRAL OF COLOGNE
ARCHITECTURE WAS THE GREAT HANDWRITING OF THE HUMAN RACE
AND THIS IS SO
TRUE THAT NOT ONLY EVERY RELIGIOUS SYMBOL BUT EVERY HUMAN THOUGHT HAS
ITS PAGE AND ITS MONUMENT IN THAT IMMENSE BOOK
ALL CIVILIZATION BEGINS IN THEOCRACY AND ENDS IN DEMOCRACY
THIS LAW OF
LIBERTY FOLLOWING UNITY IS WRITTEN IN ARCHITECTURE
FOR LET US INSIST
UPON THIS POINT MASONRY MUST NOT BE THOUGHT TO BE POWERFUL ONLY IN
ERECTING THE TEMPLE AND IN EXPRESSING THE MYTH AND SACERDOTAL SYMBOLISM
IN INSCRIBING IN HIEROGLYPHS UPON ITS PAGES OF STONE THE MYSTERIOUS
TABLES OF THE LAW
IF IT WERE THUS AS THERE COMES IN ALL HUMAN SOCIETY
A MOMENT WHEN THE SACRED SYMBOL IS WORN OUT AND BECOMES OBLITERATED
UNDER FREEDOM OF THOUGHT WHEN MAN ESCAPES FROM THE PRIEST WHEN
THE EXCRESCENCE OF PHILOSOPHIES AND SYSTEMS DEVOUR THE FACE OF
RELIGION ARCHITECTURE COULD NOT REPRODUCE THIS NEW STATE OF HUMAN
THOUGHT ITS LEAVES SO CROWDED ON THE FACE WOULD BE EMPTY ON THE BACK
ITS WORK WOULD BE MUTILATED ITS BOOK WOULD BE INCOMPLETE
BUT NO
LET US TAKE AS AN EXAMPLE THE MIDDLE AGES WHERE WE SEE MORE CLEARLY
BECAUSE IT IS NEARER TO US
DURING ITS FIRST PERIOD WHILE THEOCRACY IS
ORGANIZING EUROPE WHILE THE VATICAN IS RALLYING AND RECLASSING ABOUT
ITSELF THE ELEMENTS OF A ROME MADE FROM THE ROME WHICH LIES IN RUINS
AROUND THE CAPITOL WHILE CHRISTIANITY IS SEEKING ALL THE STAGES OF
SOCIETY AMID THE RUBBISH OF ANTERIOR CIVILIZATION AND REBUILDING WITH
ITS RUINS A NEW HIERARCHIC UNIVERSE THE KEYSTONE TO WHOSE VAULT IS THE
PRIEST ONE FIRST HEARS A DULL ECHO FROM THAT CHAOS AND THEN LITTLE BY
LITTLE ONE SEES ARISING FROM BENEATH THE BREATH OF CHRISTIANITY FROM
BENEATH THE HAND OF THE BARBARIANS FROM THE FRAGMENTS OF THE DEAD GREEK
AND ROMAN ARCHITECTURES THAT MYSTERIOUS ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE SISTER
OF THE THEOCRATIC MASONRY OF EGYPT AND OF INDIA INALTERABLE EMBLEM OF
PURE CATHOLICISM UNCHANGEABLE HIEROGLYPH OF THE PAPAL UNITY
ALL THE
THOUGHT OF THAT DAY IS WRITTEN IN FACT IN THIS SOMBRE ROMANESQUE
STYLE
ONE FEELS EVERYWHERE IN IT AUTHORITY UNITY THE IMPENETRABLE
THE ABSOLUTE GREGORY VII ALWAYS THE PRIEST NEVER THE MAN EVERYWHERE
CASTE NEVER THE PEOPLE
BUT THE CRUSADES ARRIVE
THEY ARE A GREAT POPULAR MOVEMENT AND EVERY
GREAT POPULAR MOVEMENT WHATEVER MAY BE ITS CAUSE AND OBJECT ALWAYS
SETS FREE THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY FROM ITS FINAL PRECIPITATE
NEW
THINGS SPRING INTO LIFE EVERY DAY
HERE OPENS THE STORMY PERIOD OF THE
JACQUERIES PRAGUERIES AND LEAGUES
AUTHORITY WAVERS UNITY IS DIVIDED
FEUDALISM DEMANDS TO SHARE WITH THEOCRACY WHILE AWAITING THE INEVITABLE
ARRIVAL OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL ASSUME THE PART OF THE LION QUIA
NOMINOR LEO
SEIGNORY PIERCES THROUGH SACERDOTALISM THE COMMONALITY
THROUGH SEIGNORY
THE FACE OF EUROPE IS CHANGED
WELL THE FACE OF
ARCHITECTURE IS CHANGED ALSO
LIKE CIVILIZATION IT HAS TURNED A
PAGE AND THE NEW SPIRIT OF THE TIME FINDS HER READY TO WRITE AT ITS
DICTATION
IT RETURNS FROM THE CRUSADES WITH THE POINTED ARCH LIKE THE
NATIONS WITH LIBERTY
THEN WHILE ROME IS UNDERGOING GRADUAL DISMEMBERMENT ROMANESQUE
ARCHITECTURE DIES
THE HIEROGLYPH DESERTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BETAKES
ITSELF TO BLAZONING THE DONJON KEEP IN ORDER TO LEND PRESTIGE TO
FEUDALISM
THE CATHEDRAL ITSELF THAT EDIFICE FORMERLY SO DOGMATIC
INVADED HENCEFORTH BY THE BOURGEOISIE BY THE COMMUNITY BY LIBERTY
ESCAPES THE PRIEST AND FALLS INTO THE POWER OF THE ARTIST
THE ARTIST
BUILDS IT AFTER HIS OWN FASHION
FAREWELL TO MYSTERY MYTH LAW
FANCY
AND CAPRICE WELCOME
PROVIDED THE PRIEST HAS HIS BASILICA AND HIS
ALTAR HE HAS NOTHING TO SAY
THE FOUR WALLS BELONG TO THE ARTIST
THE
ARCHITECTURAL BOOK BELONGS NO LONGER TO THE PRIEST TO RELIGION TO
ROME IT IS THE PROPERTY OF POETRY OF IMAGINATION OF THE PEOPLE
HENCE
THE RAPID AND INNUMERABLE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THAT ARCHITECTURE WHICH
OWNS BUT THREE CENTURIES SO STRIKING AFTER THE STAGNANT IMMOBILITY OF
THE ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE WHICH OWNS SIX OR SEVEN
NEVERTHELESS
ART MARCHES ON WITH GIANT STRIDES
POPULAR GENIUS AMID ORIGINALITY
ACCOMPLISH THE TASK WHICH THE BISHOPS FORMERLY FULFILLED
EACH RACE
WRITES ITS LINE UPON THE BOOK AS IT PASSES IT ERASES THE ANCIENT
ROMANESQUE HIEROGLYPHS ON THE FRONTISPIECES OF CATHEDRALS AND AT THE
MOST ONE ONLY SEES DOGMA CROPPING OUT HERE AND THERE BENEATH THE NEW
SYMBOL WHICH IT HAS DEPOSITED
THE POPULAR DRAPERY HARDLY PERMITS THE
RELIGIOUS SKELETON TO BE SUSPECTED
ONE CANNOT EVEN FORM AN IDEA OF THE
LIBERTIES WHICH THE ARCHITECTS THEN TAKE EVEN TOWARD THE CHURCH
THERE
ARE CAPITALS KNITTED OF NUNS AND MONKS SHAMELESSLY COUPLED AS ON THE
HALL OF CHIMNEY PIECES IN THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE IN PARIS
THERE IS
NOAH'S ADVENTURE CARVED TO THE LAST DETAIL AS UNDER THE GREAT PORTAL
OF BOURGES
THERE IS A BACCHANALIAN MONK WITH ASS'S EARS AND GLASS IN
HAND LAUGHING IN THE FACE OF A WHOLE COMMUNITY AS ON THE LAVATORY
OF THE ABBEY OF BOCHERVILLE
THERE EXISTS AT THAT EPOCH FOR THOUGHT
WRITTEN IN STONE A PRIVILEGE EXACTLY COMPARABLE TO OUR PRESENT LIBERTY
OF THE PRESS
IT IS THE LIBERTY OF ARCHITECTURE
THIS LIBERTY GOES VERY FAR
SOMETIMES A PORTAL A FAADE AN ENTIRE
CHURCH PRESENTS A SYMBOLICAL SENSE ABSOLUTELY FOREIGN TO WORSHIP OR
EVEN HOSTILE TO THE CHURCH
IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY GUILLAUME DE
PARIS AND NICHOLAS FLAMEL IN THE FIFTEENTH WROTE SUCH SEDITIOUS
PAGES
SAINT JACQUES DE LA BOUCHERIE WAS A WHOLE CHURCH OF THE
OPPOSITION
THOUGHT WAS THEN FREE ONLY IN THIS MANNER HENCE IT NEVER WROTE ITSELF
OUT COMPLETELY EXCEPT ON THE BOOKS CALLED EDIFICES
THOUGHT UNDER THE
FORM OF EDIFICE COULD HAVE BEHELD ITSELF BURNED IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE
BY THE HANDS OF THE EXECUTIONER IN ITS MANUSCRIPT FORM IF IT HAD BEEN
SUFFICIENTLY IMPRUDENT TO RISK ITSELF THUS THOUGHT AS THE DOOR OF A
CHURCH WOULD HAVE BEEN A SPECTATOR OF THE PUNISHMENT OF THOUGHT AS A
BOOK
HAVING THUS ONLY THIS RESOURCE MASONRY IN ORDER TO MAKE ITS WAY
TO THE LIGHT FLUNG ITSELF UPON IT FROM ALL QUARTERS
HENCE THE IMMENSE
QUANTITY OF CATHEDRALS WHICH HAVE COVERED EUROPE A NUMBER SO PRODIGIOUS
THAT ONE CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT EVEN AFTER HAVING VERIFIED IT
ALL
THE MATERIAL FORCES ALL THE INTELLECTUAL FORCES OF SOCIETY CONVERGED
TOWARDS THE SAME POINT ARCHITECTURE
IN THIS MANNER UNDER THE PRETEXT
OF BUILDING CHURCHES TO GOD ART WAS DEVELOPED IN ITS MAGNIFICENT
PROPORTIONS
THEN WHOEVER WAS BORN A POET BECAME AN ARCHITECT
GENIUS SCATTERED IN
THE MASSES REPRESSED IN EVERY QUARTER UNDER FEUDALISM AS UNDER A
TESTUDO OF BRAZEN BUCKLERS FINDING NO ISSUE EXCEPT IN THE DIRECTION
OF ARCHITECTURE GUSHED FORTH THROUGH THAT ART AND ITS ILIADS ASSUMED
THE FORM OF CATHEDRALS
ALL OTHER ARTS OBEYED AND PLACED THEMSELVES
UNDER THE DISCIPLINE OF ARCHITECTURE
THEY WERE THE WORKMEN OF THE GREAT
WORK
THE ARCHITECT THE POET THE MASTER SUMMED UP IN HIS PERSON THE
SCULPTURE WHICH CARVED HIS FAADES PAINTING WHICH ILLUMINATED HIS
WINDOWS MUSIC WHICH SET HIS BELLS TO PEALING AND BREATHED INTO HIS
ORGANS
THERE WAS NOTHING DOWN TO POOR POETRY PROPERLY SPEAKING THAT
WHICH PERSISTED IN VEGETATING IN MANUSCRIPTS WHICH WAS NOT FORCED IN
ORDER TO MAKE SOMETHING OF ITSELF TO COME AND FRAME ITSELF IN THE
EDIFICE IN THE SHAPE OF A HYMN OR OF PROSE THE SAME PART AFTER ALL
WHICH THE TRAGEDIES OF AESCHYLUS HAD PLAYED IN THE SACERDOTAL FESTIVALS
OF GREECE GENESIS IN THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON
THUS DOWN TO THE TIME OF GUTENBERG ARCHITECTURE IS THE PRINCIPAL
WRITING THE UNIVERSAL WRITING
IN THAT GRANITE BOOK BEGUN BY THE
ORIENT CONTINUED BY GREEK AND ROMAN ANTIQUITY THE MIDDLE AGES WROTE
THE LAST PAGE
MOREOVER THIS PHENOMENON OF AN ARCHITECTURE OF THE
PEOPLE FOLLOWING AN ARCHITECTURE OF CASTE WHICH WE HAVE JUST BEEN
OBSERVING IN THE MIDDLE AGES IS REPRODUCED WITH EVERY ANALOGOUS
MOVEMENT IN THE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE AT THE OTHER GREAT EPOCHS OF HISTORY
THUS IN ORDER TO ENUNCIATE HERE ONLY SUMMARILY A LAW WHICH IT WOULD
REQUIRE VOLUMES TO DEVELOP IN THE HIGH ORIENT THE CRADLE OF PRIMITIVE
TIMES AFTER HINDOO ARCHITECTURE CAME PHOENICIAN ARCHITECTURE THAT
OPULENT MOTHER OF ARABIAN ARCHITECTURE IN ANTIQUITY AFTER EGYPTIAN
ARCHITECTURE OF WHICH ETRUSCAN STYLE AND CYCLOPEAN MONUMENTS ARE BUT
ONE VARIETY CAME GREEK ARCHITECTURE OF WHICH THE ROMAN STYLE IS ONLY
A CONTINUATION SURCHARGED WITH THE CARTHAGINIAN DOME IN MODERN
TIMES AFTER ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE CAME GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE
AND BY
SEPARATING THERE THREE SERIES INTO THEIR COMPONENT PARTS WE SHALL FIND
IN THE THREE ELDEST SISTERS HINDOO ARCHITECTURE EGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE
ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE THE SAME SYMBOL THAT IS TO SAY THEOCRACY
CASTE UNITY DOGMA MYTH GOD AND FOR THE THREE YOUNGER SISTERS
PHOENICIAN ARCHITECTURE GREEK ARCHITECTURE GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE
WHATEVER NEVERTHELESS MAY BE THE DIVERSITY OF FORM INHERENT IN THEIR
NATURE THE SAME SIGNIFICATION ALSO THAT IS TO SAY LIBERTY THE
PEOPLE MAN
IN THE HINDU EGYPTIAN OR ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE ONE FEELS THE
PRIEST NOTHING BUT THE PRIEST WHETHER HE CALLS HIMSELF BRAHMIN
MAGIAN OR POPE
IT IS NOT THE SAME IN THE ARCHITECTURES OF THE PEOPLE
THEY ARE RICHER AND LESS SACRED
IN THE PHOENICIAN ONE FEELS THE
MERCHANT IN THE GREEK THE REPUBLICAN IN THE GOTHIC THE CITIZEN
THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL THEOCRATIC ARCHITECTURE ARE
IMMUTABILITY HORROR OF PROGRESS THE PRESERVATION OF TRADITIONAL LINES
THE CONSECRATION OF THE PRIMITIVE TYPES THE CONSTANT BENDING OF ALL
THE FORMS OF MEN AND OF NATURE TO THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE CAPRICES OF THE
SYMBOL
THESE ARE DARK BOOKS WHICH THE INITIATED ALONE UNDERSTAND HOW
TO DECIPHER
MOREOVER EVERY FORM EVERY DEFORMITY EVEN HAS THERE
A SENSE WHICH RENDERS IT INVIOLABLE
DO NOT ASK OF HINDOO EGYPTIAN
ROMANESQUE MASONRY TO REFORM THEIR DESIGN OR TO IMPROVE THEIR
STATUARY
EVERY ATTEMPT AT PERFECTING IS AN IMPIETY TO THEM
IN THESE
ARCHITECTURES IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE RIGIDITY OF THE DOGMA HAD
SPREAD OVER THE STONE LIKE A SORT OF SECOND PETRIFACTION
THE GENERAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF POPULAR MASONRY ON THE CONTRARY ARE PROGRESS
ORIGINALITY OPULENCE PERPETUAL MOVEMENT
THEY ARE ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY
DETACHED FROM RELIGION TO THINK OF THEIR BEAUTY TO TAKE CARE OF IT TO
CORRECT WITHOUT RELAXATION THEIR PARURE OF STATUES OR ARABESQUES
THEY
ARE OF THE AGE
THEY HAVE SOMETHING HUMAN WHICH THEY MINGLE INCESSANTLY
WITH THE DIVINE SYMBOL UNDER WHICH THEY STILL PRODUCE
HENCE
EDIFICES COMPREHENSIBLE TO EVERY SOUL TO EVERY INTELLIGENCE TO EVERY
IMAGINATION SYMBOLICAL STILL BUT AS EASY TO UNDERSTAND AS NATURE
BETWEEN THEOCRATIC ARCHITECTURE AND THIS THERE IS THE DIFFERENCE
THAT LIES BETWEEN A SACRED LANGUAGE AND A VULGAR LANGUAGE BETWEEN
HIEROGLYPHICS AND ART BETWEEN SOLOMON AND PHIDIAS
IF THE READER WILL SUM UP WHAT WE HAVE HITHERTO BRIEFLY VERY BRIEFLY
INDICATED NEGLECTING A THOUSAND PROOFS AND ALSO A THOUSAND OBJECTIONS
OF DETAIL HE WILL BE LED TO THIS THAT ARCHITECTURE WAS DOWN TO THE
FIFTEENTH CENTURY THE CHIEF REGISTER OF HUMANITY THAT IN THAT INTERVAL
NOT A THOUGHT WHICH IS IN ANY DEGREE COMPLICATED MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN
THE WORLD WHICH HAS NOT BEEN WORKED INTO AN EDIFICE THAT EVERY POPULAR
IDEA AND EVERY RELIGIOUS LAW HAS HAD ITS MONUMENTAL RECORDS THAT
THE HUMAN RACE HAS IN SHORT HAD NO IMPORTANT THOUGHT WHICH IT HAS NOT
WRITTEN IN STONE
AND WHY BECAUSE EVERY THOUGHT EITHER PHILOSOPHICAL
OR RELIGIOUS IS INTERESTED IN PERPETUATING ITSELF BECAUSE THE IDEA
WHICH HAS MOVED ONE GENERATION WISHES TO MOVE OTHERS ALSO AND LEAVE A
TRACE
NOW WHAT A PRECARIOUS IMMORTALITY IS THAT OF THE MANUSCRIPT HOW
MUCH MORE SOLID DURABLE UNYIELDING IS A BOOK OF STONE IN ORDER TO
DESTROY THE WRITTEN WORD A TORCH AND A TURK ARE SUFFICIENT
TO DEMOLISH
THE CONSTRUCTED WORD A SOCIAL REVOLUTION A TERRESTRIAL REVOLUTION ARE
REQUIRED
THE BARBARIANS PASSED OVER THE COLISEUM THE DELUGE PERHAPS
PASSED OVER THE PYRAMIDS
IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY EVERYTHING CHANGES
HUMAN THOUGHT DISCOVERS A MODE OF PERPETUATING ITSELF NOT ONLY MORE
DURABLE AND MORE RESISTING THAN ARCHITECTURE BUT STILL MORE SIMPLE AND
EASY
ARCHITECTURE IS DETHRONED
GUTENBERG'S LETTERS OF LEAD ARE ABOUT
TO SUPERSEDE ORPHEUS'S LETTERS OF STONE
THE BOOK IS ABOUT TO KILL THE EDIFICE
THE INVENTION OF PRINTING IS THE GREATEST EVENT IN HISTORY
IT IS THE
MOTHER OF REVOLUTION
IT IS THE MODE OF EXPRESSION OF HUMANITY WHICH IS
TOTALLY RENEWED IT IS HUMAN THOUGHT STRIPPING OFF ONE FORM AND DONNING
ANOTHER IT IS THE COMPLETE AND DEFINITIVE CHANGE OF SKIN OF THAT
SYMBOLICAL SERPENT WHICH SINCE THE DAYS OF ADAM HAS REPRESENTED
INTELLIGENCE
IN ITS PRINTED FORM THOUGHT IS MORE IMPERISHABLE THAN EVER IT IS
VOLATILE IRRESISTIBLE INDESTRUCTIBLE
IT IS MINGLED WITH THE AIR
IN
THE DAYS OF ARCHITECTURE IT MADE A MOUNTAIN OF ITSELF AND TOOK POWERFUL
POSSESSION OF A CENTURY AND A PLACE
NOW IT CONVERTS ITSELF INTO A FLOCK
OF BIRDS SCATTERS ITSELF TO THE FOUR WINDS AND OCCUPIES ALL POINTS OF
AIR AND SPACE AT ONCE
WE REPEAT WHO DOES NOT PERCEIVE THAT IN THIS FORM IT IS FAR MORE
INDELIBLE IT WAS SOLID IT HAS BECOME ALIVE
IT PASSES FROM DURATION
IN TIME TO IMMORTALITY
ONE CAN DEMOLISH A MASS HOW CAN ONE EXTIRPATE
UBIQUITY IF A FLOOD COMES THE MOUNTAINS WILL HAVE LONG DISAPPEARED
BENEATH THE WAVES WHILE THE BIRDS WILL STILL BE FLYING ABOUT AND IF A
SINGLE ARK FLOATS ON THE SURFACE OF THE CATACLYSM THEY WILL ALIGHT UPON
IT WILL FLOAT WITH IT WILL BE PRESENT WITH IT AT THE EBBING OF THE
WATERS AND THE NEW WORLD WHICH EMERGES FROM THIS CHAOS WILL BEHOLD ON
ITS AWAKENING THE THOUGHT OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS BEEN SUBMERGED SOARING
ABOVE IT WINGED AND LIVING
AND WHEN ONE OBSERVES THAT THIS MODE OF EXPRESSION IS NOT ONLY THE MOST
CONSERVATIVE BUT ALSO THE MOST SIMPLE THE MOST CONVENIENT THE MOST
PRACTICABLE FOR ALL WHEN ONE REFLECTS THAT IT DOES NOT DRAG AFTER IT
BULKY BAGGAGE AND DOES NOT SET IN MOTION A HEAVY APPARATUS WHEN ONE
COMPARES THOUGHT FORCED IN ORDER TO TRANSFORM ITSELF INTO AN EDIFICE
TO PUT IN MOTION FOUR OR FIVE OTHER ARTS AND TONS OF GOLD A WHOLE
MOUNTAIN OF STONES A WHOLE FOREST OF TIMBER WORK A WHOLE NATION OF
WORKMEN WHEN ONE COMPARES IT TO THE THOUGHT WHICH BECOMES A BOOK AND
FOR WHICH A LITTLE PAPER A LITTLE INK AND A PEN SUFFICE HOW CAN ONE
BE SURPRISED THAT HUMAN INTELLIGENCE SHOULD HAVE QUITTED ARCHITECTURE
FOR PRINTING CUT THE PRIMITIVE BED OF A RIVER ABRUPTLY WITH A CANAL
HOLLOWED OUT BELOW ITS LEVEL AND THE RIVER WILL DESERT ITS BED
BEHOLD HOW BEGINNING WITH THE DISCOVERY OF PRINTING ARCHITECTURE
WITHERS AWAY LITTLE BY LITTLE BECOMES LIFELESS AND BARE
HOW ONE FEELS
THE WATER SINKING THE SAP DEPARTING THE THOUGHT OF THE TIMES AND OF
THE PEOPLE WITHDRAWING FROM IT THE CHILL IS ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE IN
THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY THE PRESS IS AS YET TOO WEAK AND AT THE
MOST DRAWS FROM POWERFUL ARCHITECTURE A SUPERABUNDANCE OF LIFE
BUT PRACTICALLY BEGINNING WITH THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THE MALADY OF
ARCHITECTURE IS VISIBLE IT IS NO LONGER THE EXPRESSION OF SOCIETY IT
BECOMES CLASSIC ART IN A MISERABLE MANNER FROM BEING GALLIC EUROPEAN
INDIGENOUS IT BECOMES GREEK AND ROMAN FROM BEING TRUE AND MODERN
IT BECOMES PSEUDO CLASSIC
IT IS THIS DECADENCE WHICH IS CALLED THE
RENAISSANCE
A MAGNIFICENT DECADENCE HOWEVER FOR THE ANCIENT GOTHIC
GENIUS THAT SUN WHICH SETS BEHIND THE GIGANTIC PRESS OF MAYENCE STILL
PENETRATES FOR A WHILE LONGER WITH ITS RAYS THAT WHOLE HYBRID PILE OF
LATIN ARCADES AND CORINTHIAN COLUMNS
IT IS THAT SETTING SUN WHICH WE MISTAKE FOR THE DAWN
NEVERTHELESS FROM THE MOMENT WHEN ARCHITECTURE IS NO LONGER ANYTHING
BUT AN ART LIKE ANY OTHER AS SOON AS IT IS NO LONGER THE TOTAL ART THE
SOVEREIGN ART THE TYRANT ART IT HAS NO LONGER THE POWER TO RETAIN
THE OTHER ARTS
SO THEY EMANCIPATE THEMSELVES BREAK THE YOKE OF THE
ARCHITECT AND TAKE THEMSELVES OFF EACH ONE IN ITS OWN DIRECTION
EACH
ONE OF THEM GAINS BY THIS DIVORCE
ISOLATION AGGRANDIZES EVERYTHING
SCULPTURE BECOMES STATUARY THE IMAGE TRADE BECOMES PAINTING THE CANON
BECOMES MUSIC
ONE WOULD PRONOUNCE IT AN EMPIRE DISMEMBERED AT THE DEATH
OF ITS ALEXANDER AND WHOSE PROVINCES BECOME KINGDOMS
HENCE RAPHAEL MICHAEL ANGELO JEAN GOUJON PALESTRINA THOSE SPLENDORS
OF THE DAZZLING SIXTEENTH CENTURY
THOUGHT EMANCIPATES ITSELF IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME AS THE
ARTS
THE ARCH HERETICS OF THE MIDDLE AGES HAD ALREADY MADE LARGE
INCISIONS INTO CATHOLICISM
THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY BREAKS RELIGIOUS
UNITY
BEFORE THE INVENTION OF PRINTING REFORM WOULD HAVE BEEN MERELY
A SCHISM PRINTING CONVERTED IT INTO A REVOLUTION
TAKE AWAY THE PRESS
HERESY IS ENERVATED
WHETHER IT BE PROVIDENCE OR FATE GUTENBURG IS THE
PRECURSOR OF LUTHER
NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE SUN OF THE MIDDLE AGES IS COMPLETELY SET WHEN
THE GOTHIC GENIUS IS FOREVER EXTINCT UPON THE HORIZON ARCHITECTURE
GROWS DIM LOSES ITS COLOR BECOMES MORE AND MORE EFFACED
THE PRINTED
BOOK THE GNAWING WORM OF THE EDIFICE SUCKS AND DEVOURS IT
IT BECOMES
BARE DENUDED OF ITS FOLIAGE AND GROWS VISIBLY EMACIATED
IT IS PETTY
IT IS POOR IT IS NOTHING
IT NO LONGER EXPRESSES ANYTHING NOT EVEN THE
MEMORY OF THE ART OF ANOTHER TIME
REDUCED TO ITSELF ABANDONED BY THE
OTHER ARTS BECAUSE HUMAN THOUGHT IS ABANDONING IT IT SUMMONS
BUNGLERS IN PLACE OF ARTISTS
GLASS REPLACES THE PAINTED WINDOWS
THE
STONE CUTTER SUCCEEDS THE SCULPTOR
FAREWELL ALL SAP ALL ORIGINALITY
ALL LIFE ALL INTELLIGENCE
IT DRAGS ALONG A LAMENTABLE WORKSHOP
MENDICANT FROM COPY TO COPY
MICHAEL ANGELO WHO NO DOUBT FELT EVEN
IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THAT IT WAS DYING HAD A LAST IDEA AN IDEA OF
DESPAIR
THAT TITAN OF ART PILED THE PANTHEON ON THE PARTHENON AND MADE
SAINT PETER'S AT ROME
A GREAT WORK WHICH DESERVED TO REMAIN UNIQUE
THE LAST ORIGINALITY OF ARCHITECTURE THE SIGNATURE OF A GIANT ARTIST AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE COLOSSAL REGISTER OF STONE WHICH WAS CLOSED FOREVER
WITH MICHAEL ANGELO DEAD WHAT DOES THIS MISERABLE ARCHITECTURE WHICH
SURVIVED ITSELF IN THE STATE OF A SPECTRE DO IT TAKES SAINT PETER
IN ROME COPIES IT AND PARODIES IT
IT IS A MANIA
IT IS A PITY
EACH
CENTURY HAS ITS SAINT PETER'S OF ROME IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE
VAL DE GRCE IN THE EIGHTEENTH SAINTE GENEVIVE
EACH COUNTRY HAS ITS
SAINT PETER'S OF ROME
LONDON HAS ONE PETERSBURG HAS ANOTHER PARIS HAS
TWO OR THREE
THE INSIGNIFICANT TESTAMENT THE LAST DOTAGE OF A DECREPIT
GRAND ART FALLING BACK INTO INFANCY BEFORE IT DIES
IF IN PLACE OF THE CHARACTERISTIC MONUMENTS WHICH WE HAVE JUST
DESCRIBED WE EXAMINE THE GENERAL ASPECT OF ART FROM THE SIXTEENTH
TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WE NOTICE THE SAME PHENOMENA OF DECAY AND
PHTHISIS
BEGINNING WITH FRANOIS II THE ARCHITECTURAL FORM OF THE
EDIFICE EFFACES ITSELF MORE AND MORE AND ALLOWS THE GEOMETRICAL FORM
LIKE THE BONY STRUCTURE OF AN EMACIATED INVALID TO BECOME PROMINENT
THE FINE LINES OF ART GIVE WAY TO THE COLD AND INEXORABLE LINES OF
GEOMETRY
AN EDIFICE IS NO LONGER AN EDIFICE IT IS A POLYHEDRON
MEANWHILE ARCHITECTURE IS TORMENTED IN HER STRUGGLES TO CONCEAL THIS
NUDITY
LOOK AT THE GREEK PEDIMENT INSCRIBED UPON THE ROMAN PEDIMENT
AND VICE VERSA
IT IS STILL THE PANTHEON ON THE PARTHENON SAINT PETER'S
OF ROME
HERE ARE THE BRICK HOUSES OF HENRI IV WITH THEIR STONE
CORNERS THE PLACE ROYALE THE PLACE DAUPHINE
HERE ARE THE CHURCHES
OF LOUIS XIII HEAVY SQUAT THICKSET CROWDED TOGETHER LOADED WITH A
DOME LIKE A HUMP
HERE IS THE MAZARIN ARCHITECTURE THE WRETCHED ITALIAN
PASTICCIO OF THE FOUR NATIONS
HERE ARE THE PALACES OF LOUIS XIV LONG
BARRACKS FOR COURTIERS STIFF COLD TIRESOME
HERE FINALLY IS LOUIS
XV WITH CHICCORY LEAVES AND VERMICELLI AND ALL THE WARTS AND ALL
THE FUNGI WHICH DISFIGURE THAT DECREPIT TOOTHLESS AND COQUETTISH OLD
ARCHITECTURE
FROM FRANOIS II
TO LOUIS XV THE EVIL HAS INCREASED IN
GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION
ART HAS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT SKIN UPON ITS
BONES
IT IS MISERABLY PERISHING
MEANWHILE WHAT BECOMES OF PRINTING ALL THE LIFE WHICH IS LEAVING
ARCHITECTURE COMES TO IT
IN PROPORTION AS ARCHITECTURE EBBS PRINTING
SWELLS AND GROWS
THAT CAPITAL OF FORCES WHICH HUMAN THOUGHT HAD BEEN
EXPENDING IN EDIFICES IT HENCEFORTH EXPENDS IN BOOKS
THUS FROM THE
SIXTEENTH CENTURY ONWARD THE PRESS RAISED TO THE LEVEL OF DECAYING
ARCHITECTURE CONTENDS WITH IT AND KILLS IT
IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
IT IS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY THE SOVEREIGN SUFFICIENTLY TRIUMPHANT
SUFFICIENTLY ESTABLISHED IN ITS VICTORY TO GIVE TO THE WORLD THE FEAST
OF A GREAT LITERARY CENTURY
IN THE EIGHTEENTH HAVING REPOSED FOR A
LONG TIME AT THE COURT OF LOUIS XIV IT SEIZES AGAIN THE OLD SWORD OF
LUTHER PUTS IT INTO THE HAND OF VOLTAIRE AND RUSHES IMPETUOUSLY TO
THE ATTACK OF THAT ANCIENT EUROPE WHOSE ARCHITECTURAL EXPRESSION IT HAS
ALREADY KILLED
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY COMES TO
AN END IT HAS DESTROYED EVERYTHING
IN THE NINETEENTH IT BEGINS TO
RECONSTRUCT
NOW WE ASK WHICH OF THE THREE ARTS HAS REALLY REPRESENTED HUMAN
THOUGHT FOR THE LAST THREE CENTURIES WHICH TRANSLATES IT WHICH
EXPRESSES NOT ONLY ITS LITERARY AND SCHOLASTIC VAGARIES BUT ITS VAST
PROFOUND UNIVERSAL MOVEMENT WHICH CONSTANTLY SUPERPOSES ITSELF
WITHOUT A BREAK WITHOUT A GAP UPON THE HUMAN RACE WHICH WALKS A
MONSTER WITH A THOUSAND LEGS ARCHITECTURE OR PRINTING
IT IS PRINTING
LET THE READER MAKE NO MISTAKE ARCHITECTURE IS DEAD
IRRETRIEVABLY SLAIN BY THE PRINTED BOOK SLAIN BECAUSE IT ENDURES FOR
A SHORTER TIME SLAIN BECAUSE IT COSTS MORE
EVERY CATHEDRAL REPRESENTS
MILLIONS
LET THE READER NOW IMAGINE WHAT AN INVESTMENT OF FUNDS IT
WOULD REQUIRE TO REWRITE THE ARCHITECTURAL BOOK TO CAUSE THOUSANDS OF
EDIFICES TO SWARM ONCE MORE UPON THE SOIL TO RETURN TO THOSE EPOCHS
WHEN THE THRONG OF MONUMENTS WAS SUCH ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT OF AN
EYE WITNESS THAT ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE WORLD IN SHAKING ITSELF
HAD CAST OFF ITS OLD GARMENTS IN ORDER TO COVER ITSELF WITH A WHITE
VESTURE OF CHURCHES ERAT ENIM UT SI MUNDUS IPSE EXCUTIENDO SEMET
REJECTA VETUSTATE CANDIDA ECCLESIARUM VESTEM INDUERET
GLABER
RADOLPHUS
A BOOK IS SO SOON MADE COSTS SO LITTLE AND CAN GO SO FAR HOW CAN IT
SURPRISE US THAT ALL HUMAN THOUGHT FLOWS IN THIS CHANNEL THIS DOES NOT
MEAN THAT ARCHITECTURE WILL NOT STILL HAVE A FINE MONUMENT AN ISOLATED
MASTERPIECE HERE AND THERE
WE MAY STILL HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME UNDER
THE REIGN OF PRINTING A COLUMN MADE I SUPPOSE BY A WHOLE ARMY FROM
MELTED CANNON AS WE HAD UNDER THE REIGN OF ARCHITECTURE ILIADS AND
ROMANCEROS MAHABHRATA AND NIBELUNGEN LIEDS MADE BY A WHOLE PEOPLE
WITH RHAPSODIES PILED UP AND MELTED TOGETHER
THE GREAT ACCIDENT OF AN
ARCHITECT OF GENIUS MAY HAPPEN IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY LIKE THAT OF
DANTE IN THE THIRTEENTH
BUT ARCHITECTURE WILL NO LONGER BE THE SOCIAL
ART THE COLLECTIVE ART THE DOMINATING ART
THE GRAND POEM THE GRAND
EDIFICE THE GRAND WORK OF HUMANITY WILL NO LONGER BE BUILT IT WILL BE
PRINTED
AND HENCEFORTH IF ARCHITECTURE SHOULD ARISE AGAIN ACCIDENTALLY IT WILL
NO LONGER BE MISTRESS
IT WILL BE SUBSERVIENT TO THE LAW OF LITERATURE
WHICH FORMERLY RECEIVED THE LAW FROM IT
THE RESPECTIVE POSITIONS OF THE
TWO ARTS WILL BE INVERTED
IT IS CERTAIN THAT IN ARCHITECTURAL EPOCHS
THE POEMS RARE IT IS TRUE RESEMBLE THE MONUMENTS
IN INDIA VYASA IS
BRANCHING STRANGE IMPENETRABLE AS A PAGODA
IN EGYPTIAN ORIENT POETRY
HAS LIKE THE EDIFICES GRANDEUR AND TRANQUILLITY OF LINE IN ANTIQUE
GREECE BEAUTY SERENITY CALM IN CHRISTIAN EUROPE THE CATHOLIC
MAJESTY THE POPULAR NAIVETE THE RICH AND LUXURIANT VEGETATION OF
AN EPOCH OF RENEWAL
THE BIBLE RESEMBLES THE PYRAMIDS THE ILIAD THE
PARTHENON HOMER PHIDIAS
DANTE IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY IS THE
LAST ROMANESQUE CHURCH SHAKESPEARE IN THE SIXTEENTH THE LAST GOTHIC
CATHEDRAL
THUS TO SUM UP WHAT WE HAVE HITHERTO SAID IN A FASHION WHICH IS
NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE AND MUTILATED THE HUMAN RACE HAS TWO BOOKS TWO
REGISTERS TWO TESTAMENTS MASONRY AND PRINTING THE BIBLE OF STONE AND
THE BIBLE OF PAPER
NO DOUBT WHEN ONE CONTEMPLATES THESE TWO BIBLES
LAID SO BROADLY OPEN IN THE CENTURIES IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO REGRET THE
VISIBLE MAJESTY OF THE WRITING OF GRANITE THOSE GIGANTIC ALPHABETS
FORMULATED IN COLONNADES IN PYLONS IN OBELISKS THOSE SORTS OF HUMAN
MOUNTAINS WHICH COVER THE WORLD AND THE PAST FROM THE PYRAMID TO THE
BELL TOWER FROM CHEOPS TO STRASBURG
THE PAST MUST BE REREAD UPON THESE
PAGES OF MARBLE
THIS BOOK WRITTEN BY ARCHITECTURE MUST BE ADMIRED
AND PERUSED INCESSANTLY BUT THE GRANDEUR OF THE EDIFICE WHICH PRINTING
ERECTS IN ITS TURN MUST NOT BE DENIED
THAT EDIFICE IS COLOSSAL
SOME COMPILER OF STATISTICS HAS CALCULATED
THAT IF ALL THE VOLUMES WHICH HAVE ISSUED FROM THE PRESS SINCE
GUTENBERG'S DAY WERE TO BE PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER THEY WOULD FILL
THE SPACE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE MOON BUT IT IS NOT THAT SORT OF
GRANDEUR OF WHICH WE WISHED TO SPEAK
NEVERTHELESS WHEN ONE TRIES TO
COLLECT IN ONE'S MIND A COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE OF THE TOTAL PRODUCTS OF
PRINTING DOWN TO OUR OWN DAYS DOES NOT THAT TOTAL APPEAR TO US LIKE AN
IMMENSE CONSTRUCTION RESTING UPON THE ENTIRE WORLD AT WHICH HUMANITY
TOILS WITHOUT RELAXATION AND WHOSE MONSTROUS CREST IS LOST IN THE
PROFOUND MISTS OF THE FUTURE IT IS THE ANTHILL OF INTELLIGENCE
IT IS
THE HIVE WHITHER COME ALL IMAGINATIONS THOSE GOLDEN BEES WITH THEIR
HONEY
THE EDIFICE HAS A THOUSAND STORIES
HERE AND THERE ONE BEHOLDS ON ITS
STAIRCASES THE GLOOMY CAVERNS OF SCIENCE WHICH PIERCE ITS INTERIOR
EVERYWHERE UPON ITS SURFACE ART CAUSES ITS ARABESQUES ROSETTES AND
LACES TO THRIVE LUXURIANTLY BEFORE THE EYES
THERE EVERY INDIVIDUAL
WORK HOWEVER CAPRICIOUS AND ISOLATED IT MAY SEEM HAS ITS PLACE AND
ITS PROJECTION
HARMONY RESULTS FROM THE WHOLE
FROM THE CATHEDRAL OF
SHAKESPEARE TO THE MOSQUE OF BYRON A THOUSAND TINY BELL TOWERS ARE
PILED PELL MELL ABOVE THIS METROPOLIS OF UNIVERSAL THOUGHT
AT ITS BASE
ARE WRITTEN SOME ANCIENT TITLES OF HUMANITY WHICH ARCHITECTURE HAD
NOT REGISTERED
TO THE LEFT OF THE ENTRANCE HAS BEEN FIXED THE ANCIENT
BAS RELIEF IN WHITE MARBLE OF HOMER TO THE RIGHT THE POLYGLOT BIBLE
REARS ITS SEVEN HEADS
THE HYDRA OF THE ROMANCERO AND SOME OTHER HYBRID
FORMS THE VEDAS AND THE NIBELUNGEN BRISTLE FURTHER ON
NEVERTHELESS THE PRODIGIOUS EDIFICE STILL REMAINS INCOMPLETE
THE
PRESS THAT GIANT MACHINE WHICH INCESSANTLY PUMPS ALL THE INTELLECTUAL
SAP OF SOCIETY BELCHES FORTH WITHOUT PAUSE FRESH MATERIALS FOR ITS

BOOK SIXTH
CHAPTER I
AN IMPARTIAL GLANCE AT THE ANCIENT MAGISTRACY
A VERY HAPPY PERSONAGE IN THE YEAR OF GRACE 1482 WAS THE NOBLE
GENTLEMAN ROBERT D'ESTOUTEVILLE CHEVALIER SIEUR DE BEYNE BARON D'IVRY
AND SAINT ANDRY EN LA MARCHE COUNSELLOR AND CHAMBERLAIN TO THE KING
AND GUARD OF THE PROVOSTSHIP OF PARIS
IT WAS ALREADY NEARLY SEVENTEEN
YEARS SINCE HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE KING ON NOVEMBER 7 1465 THE
COMET YEAR THAT FINE CHARGE OF THE PROVOSTSHIP OF PARIS WHICH WAS
REPUTED RATHER A SEIGNEURY THAN AN OFFICE
DIGNITAS SAYS JOANNES
LOEMNOEUS QU CUM NON EXIGUA POTESTATE POLITIAM CONCERNENTE ATQUE
PROEROGATIVIS MULTIS ET JURIBUS CONJUNCTA EST
A MARVELLOUS THING IN
'82 WAS A GENTLEMAN BEARING THE KING'S COMMISSION AND WHOSE LETTERS
OF INSTITUTION RAN BACK TO THE EPOCH OF THE MARRIAGE OF THE NATURAL
DAUGHTER OF LOUIS XI
WITH MONSIEUR THE BASTARD OF BOURBON
THIS COMET AGAINST WHICH POPE CALIXTUS UNCLE OF BORGIA
ORDERED PUBLIC PRAYERS IS THE SAME WHICH REAPPEARED IN 1835
THE SAME DAY ON WHICH ROBERT D'ESTOUTEVILLE TOOK THE PLACE OF JACQUES
DE VILLIERS IN THE PROVOSTSHIP OF PARIS MASTER JEHAN DAUVET REPLACED
MESSIRE HELYE DE THORRETTES IN THE FIRST PRESIDENCY OF THE COURT OF
PARLIAMENT JEHAN JOUVENEL DES URSINS SUPPLANTED PIERRE DE MORVILLIERS
IN THE OFFICE OF CHANCELLOR OF FRANCE REGNAULT DES DORMANS OUSTED
PIERRE PUY FROM THE CHARGE OF MASTER OF REQUESTS IN ORDINARY OF THE
KING'S HOUSEHOLD
NOW UPON HOW MANY HEADS HAD THE PRESIDENCY THE
CHANCELLORSHIP THE MASTERSHIP PASSED SINCE ROBERT D'ESTOUTEVILLE
HAD HELD THE PROVOSTSHIP OF PARIS
IT HAD BEEN GRANTED TO HIM FOR
SAFEKEEPING AS THE LETTERS PATENT SAID AND CERTAINLY HE KEPT IT
WELL
HE HAD CLUNG TO IT HE HAD INCORPORATED HIMSELF WITH IT HE HAD
SO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH IT THAT HE HAD ESCAPED THAT FURY FOR CHANGE
WHICH POSSESSED LOUIS XI A TORMENTING AND INDUSTRIOUS KING WHOSE
POLICY IT WAS TO MAINTAIN THE ELASTICITY OF HIS POWER BY FREQUENT
APPOINTMENTS AND REVOCATIONS
MORE THAN THIS THE BRAVE CHEVALIER HAD
OBTAINED THE REVERSION OF THE OFFICE FOR HIS SON AND FOR TWO YEARS
ALREADY THE NAME OF THE NOBLE MAN JACQUES D'ESTOUTEVILLE EQUERRY HAD
FIGURED BESIDE HIS AT THE HEAD OF THE REGISTER OF THE SALARY LIST OF THE
PROVOSTSHIP OF PARIS
A RARE AND NOTABLE FAVOR INDEED IT IS TRUE THAT
ROBERT D'ESTOUTEVILLE WAS A GOOD SOLDIER THAT HE HAD LOYALLY RAISED HIS
PENNON AGAINST THE LEAGUE OF PUBLIC GOOD AND THAT HE HAD PRESENTED
TO THE QUEEN A VERY MARVELLOUS STAG IN CONFECTIONERY ON THE DAY OF HER
ENTRANCE TO PARIS IN 14
MOREOVER HE POSSESSED THE GOOD FRIENDSHIP
OF MESSIRE TRISTAN L'HERMITE PROVOST OF THE MARSHALS OF THE KING'S
HOUSEHOLD
HENCE A VERY SWEET AND PLEASANT EXISTENCE WAS THAT OF MESSIRE
ROBERT
IN THE FIRST PLACE VERY GOOD WAGES TO WHICH WERE ATTACHED AND
FROM WHICH HUNG LIKE EXTRA BUNCHES OF GRAPES ON HIS VINE THE REVENUES
OF THE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL REGISTRIES OF THE PROVOSTSHIP PLUS THE CIVIL
AND CRIMINAL REVENUES OF THE TRIBUNALS OF EMBAS OF THE CHTELET WITHOUT
RECKONING SOME LITTLE TOLL FROM THE BRIDGES OF MANTES AND OF CORBEIL
AND THE PROFITS ON THE CRAFT OF SHAGREEN MAKERS OF PARIS ON THE CORDERS
OF FIREWOOD AND THE MEASURERS OF SALT
ADD TO THIS THE PLEASURE OF
DISPLAYING HIMSELF IN RIDES ABOUT THE CITY AND OF MAKING HIS FINE
MILITARY COSTUME WHICH YOU MAY STILL ADMIRE SCULPTURED ON HIS TOMB
IN THE ABBEY OF VALMONT IN NORMANDY AND HIS MORION ALL EMBOSSED AT
MONTLHRY STAND OUT A CONTRAST AGAINST THE PARTI COLORED RED AND TAWNY
ROBES OF THE ALDERMEN AND POLICE
AND THEN WAS IT NOTHING TO WIELD
ABSOLUTE SUPREMACY OVER THE SERGEANTS OF THE POLICE THE PORTER AND
WATCH OF THE CHTELET THE TWO AUDITORS OF THE CHTELET AUDITORES
CASTELLETI THE SIXTEEN COMMISSIONERS OF THE SIXTEEN QUARTERS THE
JAILER OF THE CHTELET THE FOUR ENFEOFFED SERGEANTS THE HUNDRED AND
TWENTY MOUNTED SERGEANTS WITH MACES THE CHEVALIER OF THE WATCH WITH
HIS WATCH HIS SUB WATCH HIS COUNTER WATCH AND HIS REAR WATCH WAS IT
NOTHING TO EXERCISE HIGH AND LOW JUSTICE THE RIGHT TO INTERROGATE
TO HANG AND TO DRAW WITHOUT RECKONING PETTY JURISDICTION IN THE FIRST
RESORT IN PRIMA INSTANTIA AS THE CHARTERS SAY ON THAT VISCOMTY
OF PARIS SO NOBLY APPANAGED WITH SEVEN NOBLE BAILIWICKS CAN ANYTHING
SWEETER BE IMAGINED THAN RENDERING JUDGMENTS AND DECISIONS AS MESSIRE
ROBERT D'ESTOUTEVILLE DAILY DID IN THE GRAND CHTELET UNDER THE LARGE
AND FLATTENED ARCHES OF PHILIP AUGUSTUS AND GOING AS HE WAS WONT TO
DO EVERY EVENING TO THAT CHARMING HOUSE SITUATED IN THE RUE GALILEE IN
THE ENCLOSURE OF THE ROYAL PALACE WHICH HE HELD IN RIGHT OF HIS WIFE
MADAME AMBROISE DE LORE TO REPOSE AFTER THE FATIGUE OF HAVING SENT
SOME POOR WRETCH TO PASS THE NIGHT IN THAT LITTLE CELL OF THE RUE DE
ESCORCHERIE WHICH THE PROVOSTS AND ALDERMEN OF PARIS USED TO MAKE THEIR
PRISON THE SAME BEING ELEVEN FEET LONG SEVEN FEET AND FOUR INCHES
WIDE AND ELEVEN FEET HIGH
COMPTES DU DOMAINE 1383
AND NOT ONLY HAD MESSIRE ROBERT D'ESTOUTEVILLE HIS SPECIAL COURT AS
PROVOST AND VICOMTE OF PARIS BUT IN ADDITION HE HAD A SHARE BOTH FOR
EYE AND TOOTH IN THE GRAND COURT OF THE KING
THERE WAS NO HEAD IN THE
LEAST ELEVATED WHICH HAD NOT PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS BEFORE IT CAME TO
THE HEADSMAN
IT WAS HE WHO WENT TO SEEK M
DE NEMOURS AT THE BASTILLE
SAINT ANTOINE IN ORDER TO CONDUCT HIM TO THE HALLES AND TO CONDUCT TO
THE GRVE M
DE SAINT POL WHO CLAMORED AND RESISTED TO THE GREAT JOY
OF THE PROVOST WHO DID NOT LOVE MONSIEUR THE CONSTABLE
HERE ASSUREDLY IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO RENDER A LIFE HAPPY AND
ILLUSTRIOUS AND TO DESERVE SOME DAY A NOTABLE PAGE IN THAT INTERESTING
HISTORY OF THE PROVOSTS OF PARIS WHERE ONE LEARNS THAT OUDARD DE
VILLENEUVE HAD A HOUSE IN THE RUE DES BOUCHERIES THAT GUILLAUME
DE HANGEST PURCHASED THE GREAT AND THE LITTLE SAVOY THAT GUILLAUME
THIBOUST GAVE THE NUNS OF SAINTE GENEVIVE HIS HOUSES IN THE RUE CLOPIN
THAT HUGUES AUBRIOT LIVED IN THE HTEL DU PORE EPIC AND OTHER DOMESTIC
FACTS
NEVERTHELESS WITH SO MANY REASONS FOR TAKING LIFE PATIENTLY AND
JOYOUSLY MESSIRE ROBERT D'ESTOUTEVILLE WOKE UP ON THE MORNING OF THE
SEVENTH OF JANUARY 1482 IN A VERY SURLY AND PEEVISH MOOD
WHENCE CAME
THIS ILL TEMPER HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD HIMSELF
WAS IT BECAUSE THE SKY
WAS GRAY OR WAS THE BUCKLE OF HIS OLD BELT OF MONTLHRY BADLY FASTENED
SO THAT IT CONFINED HIS PROVOSTAL PORTLINESS TOO CLOSELY HAD HE BEHELD
RIBALD FELLOWS MARCHING IN BANDS OF FOUR BENEATH HIS WINDOW AND
SETTING HIM AT DEFIANCE IN DOUBLETS BUT NO SHIRTS HATS WITHOUT CROWNS
WITH WALLET AND BOTTLE AT THEIR SIDE WAS IT A VAGUE PRESENTIMENT OF THE
THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LIVRES SIXTEEN SOUS EIGHT FARTHINGS WHICH
THE FUTURE KING CHARLES VII
WAS TO CUT OFF FROM THE PROVOSTSHIP IN THE
FOLLOWING YEAR THE READER CAN TAKE HIS CHOICE WE FOR OUR PART ARE
MUCH INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS IN A BAD HUMOR SIMPLY BECAUSE HE
WAS IN A BAD HUMOR
MOREOVER IT WAS THE DAY AFTER A FESTIVAL A TIRESOME DAY FOR EVERY ONE
AND ABOVE ALL FOR THE MAGISTRATE WHO IS CHARGED WITH SWEEPING AWAY ALL
THE FILTH PROPERLY AND FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING WHICH A FESTIVAL DAY
PRODUCES IN PARIS
AND THEN HE HAD TO HOLD A SITTING AT THE GRAND
CHTELET
NOW WE HAVE NOTICED THAT JUDGES IN GENERAL SO ARRANGE MATTERS
THAT THEIR DAY OF AUDIENCE SHALL ALSO BE THEIR DAY OF BAD HUMOR SO THAT
THEY MAY ALWAYS HAVE SOME ONE UPON WHOM TO VENT IT CONVENIENTLY IN THE
NAME OF THE KING LAW AND JUSTICE
HOWEVER THE AUDIENCE HAD BEGUN WITHOUT HIM
HIS LIEUTENANTS CIVIL
CRIMINAL AND PRIVATE WERE DOING HIS WORK ACCORDING TO USAGE AND
FROM EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SOME SCORES OF BOURGEOIS AND
BOURGEOISES HEAPED AND CROWDED INTO AN OBSCURE CORNER OF THE AUDIENCE
CHAMBER OF EMBAS DU CHTELET BETWEEN A STOUT OAKEN BARRIER AND THE
WALL HAD BEEN GAZING BLISSFULLY AT THE VARIED AND CHEERFUL SPECTACLE OF
CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE DISPENSED BY MASTER FLORIAN BARBEDIENNE
AUDITOR OF THE CHTELET LIEUTENANT OF MONSIEUR THE PROVOST IN A
SOMEWHAT CONFUSED AND UTTERLY HAPHAZARD MANNER
THE HALL WAS SMALL LOW VAULTED
A TABLE STUDDED WITH FLEURS DE LIS
STOOD AT ONE END WITH A LARGE ARM CHAIR OF CARVED OAK WHICH BELONGED
TO THE PROVOST AND WAS EMPTY AND A STOOL ON THE LEFT FOR THE AUDITOR
MASTER FLORIAN
BELOW SAT THE CLERK OF THE COURT SCRIBBLING OPPOSITE
WAS THE POPULACE AND IN FRONT OF THE DOOR AND IN FRONT OF THE TABLE
WERE MANY SERGEANTS OF THE PROVOSTSHIP IN SLEEVELESS JACKETS OF VIOLET
CAMLET WITH WHITE CROSSES
TWO SERGEANTS OF THE PARLOIR AUX BOURGEOIS
CLOTHED IN THEIR JACKETS OF TOUSSAINT HALF RED HALF BLUE WERE
POSTED AS SENTINELS BEFORE A LOW CLOSED DOOR WHICH WAS VISIBLE AT
THE EXTREMITY OF THE HALL BEHIND THE TABLE
A SINGLE POINTED WINDOW
NARROWLY ENCASED IN THE THICK WALL ILLUMINATED WITH A PALE RAY OF
JANUARY SUN TWO GROTESQUE FIGURES THE CAPRICIOUS DEMON OF STONE CARVED
AS A TAIL PIECE IN THE KEYSTONE OF THE VAULTED CEILING AND THE JUDGE
SEATED AT THE END OF THE HALL ON THE FLEURS DE LIS
IMAGINE IN FACT AT THE PROVOST'S TABLE LEANING UPON HIS ELBOWS
BETWEEN TWO BUNDLES OF DOCUMENTS OF CASES WITH HIS FOOT ON THE TRAIN
OF HIS ROBE OF PLAIN BROWN CLOTH HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HOOD OF WHITE
LAMB'S SKIN OF WHICH HIS BROWS SEEMED TO BE OF A PIECE RED CRABBED
WINKING BEARING MAJESTICALLY THE LOAD OF FAT ON HIS CHEEKS WHICH MET
UNDER HIS CHIN MASTER FLORIAN BARBEDIENNE AUDITOR OF THE CHTELET
NOW THE AUDITOR WAS DEAF
A SLIGHT DEFECT IN AN AUDITOR
MASTER FLORIAN
DELIVERED JUDGMENT NONE THE LESS WITHOUT APPEAL AND VERY SUITABLY
IT
IS CERTAINLY QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR A JUDGE TO HAVE THE AIR OF LISTENING
AND THE VENERABLE AUDITOR FULFILLED THIS CONDITION THE SOLE ONE IN
JUSTICE ALL THE BETTER BECAUSE HIS ATTENTION COULD NOT BE DISTRACTED BY
ANY NOISE
MOREOVER HE HAD IN THE AUDIENCE A PITILESS CENSOR OF HIS DEEDS AND
GESTURES IN THE PERSON OF OUR FRIEND JEHAN FROLLO DU MOULIN THAT
LITTLE STUDENT OF YESTERDAY THAT STROLLER WHOM ONE WAS SURE OF
ENCOUNTERING ALL OVER PARIS ANYWHERE EXCEPT BEFORE THE ROSTRUMS OF THE
PROFESSORS

AND A FINE ONE TOO
HERCLE 'TIS OUR PRINCE OF YESTERDAY OUR POPE OF THE FOOLS
OUR BELLRINGER OUR ONE EYED MAN OUR HUNCHBACK OUR GRIMACE 'TIS
QUASIMODO
IT WAS HE INDEED
IT WAS QUASIMODO BOUND ENCIRCLED ROPED PINIONED AND UNDER GOOD
GUARD
THE SQUAD OF POLICEMEN WHO SURROUNDED HIM WAS ASSISTED BY THE
CHEVALIER OF THE WATCH IN PERSON WEARING THE ARMS OF FRANCE EMBROIDERED
ON HIS BREAST AND THE ARMS OF THE CITY ON HIS BACK
THERE WAS NOTHING
HOWEVER ABOUT QUASIMODO EXCEPT HIS DEFORMITY WHICH COULD JUSTIFY THE
DISPLAY OF HALBERDS AND ARQUEBUSES HE WAS GLOOMY SILENT AND TRANQUIL
ONLY NOW AND THEN DID HIS SINGLE EYE CAST A SLY AND WRATHFUL GLANCE UPON
THE BONDS WITH WHICH HE WAS LOADED
HE CAST THE SAME GLANCE ABOUT HIM BUT IT WAS SO DULL AND SLEEPY THAT
THE WOMEN ONLY POINTED HIM OUT TO EACH OTHER IN DERISION
MEANWHILE MASTER FLORIAN THE AUDITOR TURNED OVER ATTENTIVELY THE
DOCUMENT IN THE COMPLAINT ENTERED AGAINST QUASIMODO WHICH THE CLERK
HANDED HIM AND HAVING THUS GLANCED AT IT APPEARED TO REFLECT FOR A
MOMENT
THANKS TO THIS PRECAUTION WHICH HE ALWAYS WAS CAREFUL TO TAKE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN ON THE POINT OF BEGINNING AN EXAMINATION HE KNEW
BEFOREHAND THE NAMES TITLES AND MISDEEDS OF THE ACCUSED MADE CUT
AND DRIED RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS FORESEEN AND SUCCEEDED IN EXTRICATING
HIMSELF FROM ALL THE WINDINGS OF THE INTERROGATION WITHOUT ALLOWING HIS
DEAFNESS TO BE TOO APPARENT
THE WRITTEN CHARGES WERE TO HIM WHAT THE
DOG IS TO THE BLIND MAN
IF HIS DEAFNESS DID HAPPEN TO BETRAY HIM
HERE AND THERE BY SOME INCOHERENT APOSTROPHE OR SOME UNINTELLIGIBLE
QUESTION IT PASSED FOR PROFUNDITY WITH SOME AND FOR IMBECILITY WITH
OTHERS
IN NEITHER CASE DID THE HONOR OF THE MAGISTRACY SUSTAIN ANY
INJURY FOR IT IS FAR BETTER THAT A JUDGE SHOULD BE REPUTED IMBECILE
OR PROFOUND THAN DEAF
HENCE HE TOOK GREAT CARE TO CONCEAL HIS DEAFNESS
FROM THE EYES OF ALL AND HE GENERALLY SUCCEEDED SO WELL THAT HE HAD
REACHED THE POINT OF DELUDING HIMSELF WHICH IS BY THE WAY EASIER
THAN IS SUPPOSED
ALL HUNCHBACKS WALK WITH THEIR HEADS HELD HIGH ALL
STUTTERERS HARANGUE ALL DEAF PEOPLE SPEAK LOW
AS FOR HIM HE BELIEVED
AT THE MOST THAT HIS EAR WAS A LITTLE REFRACTORY
IT WAS THE SOLE
CONCESSION WHICH HE MADE ON THIS POINT TO PUBLIC OPINION IN HIS MOMENTS
OF FRANKNESS AND EXAMINATION OF HIS CONSCIENCE
HAVING THEN THOROUGHLY RUMINATED QUASIMODO'S AFFAIR HE THREW BACK
HIS HEAD AND HALF CLOSED HIS EYES FOR THE SAKE OF MORE MAJESTY AND
IMPARTIALITY SO THAT AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS BOTH DEAF AND BLIND
A
DOUBLE CONDITION WITHOUT WHICH NO JUDGE IS PERFECT
IT WAS IN THIS
MAGISTERIAL ATTITUDE THAT HE BEGAN THE EXAMINATION
YOUR NAME
NOW THIS WAS A CASE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN PROVIDED FOR BY LAW WHERE A
DEAF MAN SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO QUESTION A DEAF MAN
QUASIMODO WHOM NOTHING WARNED THAT A QUESTION HAD BEEN ADDRESSED TO
HIM CONTINUED TO STARE INTENTLY AT THE JUDGE AND MADE NO REPLY
THE
JUDGE BEING DEAF AND BEING IN NO WAY WARNED OF THE DEAFNESS OF THE
ACCUSED THOUGHT THAT THE LATTER HAD ANSWERED AS ALL ACCUSED DO IN
GENERAL AND THEREFORE HE PURSUED WITH HIS MECHANICAL AND STUPID
SELF POSSESSION
VERY WELL
AND YOUR AGE
AGAIN QUASIMODO MADE NO REPLY TO THIS QUESTION
THE JUDGE SUPPOSED THAT
IT HAD BEEN REPLIED TO AND CONTINUED
NOW YOUR PROFESSION
STILL THE SAME SILENCE
THE SPECTATORS HAD BEGUN MEANWHILE TO WHISPER
TOGETHER AND TO EXCHANGE GLANCES
THAT WILL DO WENT ON THE IMPERTURBABLE AUDITOR WHEN HE SUPPOSED THAT
THE ACCUSED HAD FINISHED HIS THIRD REPLY
YOU ARE ACCUSED BEFORE US
PRIMO OF NOCTURNAL DISTURBANCE SECUNDO OF A DISHONORABLE ACT
OF VIOLENCE UPON THE PERSON OF A FOOLISH WOMAN IN PROEJUDICIUM
MERETRICIS TERTIO OF REBELLION AND DISLOYALTY TOWARDS THE ARCHERS
OF THE POLICE OF OUR LORD THE KING
EXPLAIN YOURSELF UPON ALL THESE
POINTS CLERK HAVE YOU WRITTEN DOWN WHAT THE PRISONER HAS SAID THUS
FAR
AT THIS UNLUCKY QUESTION A BURST OF LAUGHTER ROSE FROM THE CLERK'S
TABLE CAUGHT BY THE AUDIENCE SO VIOLENT SO WILD SO CONTAGIOUS SO
UNIVERSAL THAT THE TWO DEAF MEN WERE FORCED TO PERCEIVE IT
QUASIMODO
TURNED ROUND SHRUGGING HIS HUMP WITH DISDAIN WHILE MASTER FLORIAN
EQUALLY ASTONISHED AND SUPPOSING THAT THE LAUGHTER OF THE SPECTATORS
HAD BEEN PROVOKED BY SOME IRREVERENT REPLY FROM THE ACCUSED RENDERED
VISIBLE TO HIM BY THAT SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS APOSTROPHIZED HIM
INDIGNANTLY
YOU HAVE UTTERED A REPLY KNAVE WHICH DESERVES THE HALTER
DO YOU KNOW
TO WHOM YOU ARE SPEAKING
THIS SALLY WAS NOT FITTED TO ARREST THE EXPLOSION OF GENERAL MERRIMENT
IT STRUCK ALL AS SO WHIMSICAL AND SO RIDICULOUS THAT THE WILD LAUGHTER
EVEN ATTACKED THE SERGEANTS OF THE PARLOI AUX BOURGEOIS A SORT OF
PIKEMEN WHOSE STUPIDITY WAS PART OF THEIR UNIFORM
QUASIMODO ALONE
PRESERVED HIS SERIOUSNESS FOR THE GOOD REASON THAT HE UNDERSTOOD
NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND HIM
THE JUDGE MORE AND MORE
IRRITATED THOUGHT IT HIS DUTY TO CONTINUE IN THE SAME TONE HOPING
THEREBY TO STRIKE THE ACCUSED WITH A TERROR WHICH SHOULD REACT UPON THE
AUDIENCE AND BRING IT BACK TO RESPECT
SO THIS IS AS MUCH AS TO SAY PERVERSE AND THIEVING KNAVE THAT YOU ARE
THAT YOU PERMIT YOURSELF TO BE LACKING IN RESPECT TOWARDS THE AUDITOR
OF THE CHTELET TO THE MAGISTRATE COMMITTED TO THE POPULAR POLICE
OF PARIS CHARGED WITH SEARCHING OUT CRIMES DELINQUENCIES AND EVIL
CONDUCT WITH CONTROLLING ALL TRADES AND INTERDICTING MONOPOLY WITH
MAINTAINING THE PAVEMENTS WITH DEBARRING THE HUCKSTERS OF CHICKENS
POULTRY AND WATER FOWL OF SUPERINTENDING THE MEASURING OF FAGOTS
AND OTHER SORTS OF WOOD OF PURGING THE CITY OF MUD AND THE AIR OF
CONTAGIOUS MALADIES IN A WORD WITH ATTENDING CONTINUALLY TO PUBLIC
AFFAIRS WITHOUT WAGES OR HOPE OF SALARY DO YOU KNOW THAT I AM CALLED
FLORIAN BARBEDIENNE ACTUAL LIEUTENANT TO MONSIEUR THE PROVOST AND
MOREOVER COMMISSIONER INQUISITOR CONTROLLER AND EXAMINER WITH EQUAL
POWER IN PROVOSTSHIP BAILIWICK PRESERVATION AND INFERIOR COURT OF
JUDICATURE
THERE IS NO REASON WHY A DEAF MAN TALKING TO A DEAF MAN SHOULD STOP
GOD KNOWS WHERE AND WHEN MASTER FLORIAN WOULD HAVE LANDED WHEN THUS
LAUNCHED AT FULL SPEED IN LOFTY ELOQUENCE IF THE LOW DOOR AT THE
EXTREME END OF THE ROOM HAD NOT SUDDENLY OPENED AND GIVEN ENTRANCE
TO THE PROVOST IN PERSON
AT HIS ENTRANCE MASTER FLORIAN DID NOT STOP
SHORT BUT MAKING A HALF TURN ON HIS HEELS AND AIMING AT THE PROVOST
THE HARANGUE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN WITHERING QUASIMODO A MOMENT
BEFORE
MONSEIGNEUR SAID HE I DEMAND SUCH PENALTY AS YOU SHALL DEEM FITTING
AGAINST THE PRISONER HERE PRESENT FOR GRAVE AND AGGRAVATED OFFENCE
AGAINST THE COURT
AND HE SEATED HIMSELF UTTERLY BREATHLESS WIPING AWAY THE GREAT
DROPS OF SWEAT WHICH FELL FROM HIS BROW AND DRENCHED LIKE TEARS THE
PARCHMENTS SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
MESSIRE ROBERT D'ESTOUTEVILLE FROWNED
AND MADE A GESTURE SO IMPERIOUS AND SIGNIFICANT TO QUASIMODO THAT THE
DEAF MAN IN SOME MEASURE UNDERSTOOD IT
THE PROVOST ADDRESSED HIM WITH SEVERITY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE THAT YOU
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HITHER KNAVE
THE POOR FELLOW SUPPOSING THAT THE PROVOST WAS ASKING HIS NAME BROKE
THE SILENCE WHICH HE HABITUALLY PRESERVED AND REPLIED IN A HARSH AND
GUTTURAL VOICE QUASIMODO
THE REPLY MATCHED THE QUESTION SO LITTLE THAT THE WILD LAUGH BEGAN TO
CIRCULATE ONCE MORE AND MESSIRE ROBERT EXCLAIMED RED WITH WRATH
ARE YOU MOCKING ME ALSO YOU ARRANT KNAVE
BELLRINGER OF NOTRE DAME REPLIED QUASIMODO SUPPOSING THAT WHAT WAS
REQUIRED OF HIM WAS TO EXPLAIN TO THE JUDGE WHO HE WAS
BELLRINGER INTERPOLATED THE PROVOST WHO HAD WAKED UP EARLY ENOUGH TO
BE IN A SUFFICIENTLY BAD TEMPER AS WE HAVE SAID NOT TO REQUIRE TO HAVE
HIS FURY INFLAMED BY SUCH STRANGE RESPONSES
BELLRINGER I'LL PLAY YOU
A CHIME OF RODS ON YOUR BACK THROUGH THE SQUARES OF PARIS DO YOU HEAR
KNAVE
IF IT IS MY AGE THAT YOU WISH TO KNOW SAID QUASIMODO I THINK THAT I
SHALL BE TWENTY AT SAINT MARTIN'S DAY
THIS WAS TOO MUCH THE PROVOST COULD NO LONGER RESTRAIN HIMSELF
AH YOU ARE SCOFFING AT THE PROVOSTSHIP WRETCH MESSIEURS THE
SERGEANTS OF THE MACE YOU WILL TAKE ME THIS KNAVE TO THE PILLORY OF THE
GRVE YOU WILL FLOG HIM AND TURN HIM FOR AN HOUR
HE SHALL PAY ME FOR
IT TTE DIEU AND I ORDER THAT THE PRESENT JUDGMENT SHALL BE CRIED
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF FOUR SWORN TRUMPETERS IN THE SEVEN CASTELLANIES
OF THE VISCOMTY OF PARIS
THE CLERK SET TO WORK INCONTINENTLY TO DRAW UP THE ACCOUNT OF THE
SENTENCE
VENTRE DIEU 'TIS WELL ADJUDGED CRIED THE LITTLE SCHOLAR JEHAN
FROLLO DU MOULIN FROM HIS CORNER
THE PROVOST TURNED AND FIXED HIS FLASHING EYES ONCE MORE ON QUASIMODO
I BELIEVE THE KNAVE SAID VENTRE DIEU CLERK ADD TWELVE DENIERS
PARISIAN FOR THE OATH AND LET THE VESTRY OF SAINT EUSTACHE HAVE THE
HALF OF IT I HAVE A PARTICULAR DEVOTION FOR SAINT EUSTACHE
IN A FEW MINUTES THE SENTENCE WAS DRAWN UP
ITS TENOR WAS SIMPLE AND
BRIEF
THE CUSTOMS OF THE PROVOSTSHIP AND THE VISCOMTY HAD NOT YET
BEEN WORKED OVER BY PRESIDENT THIBAUT BAILLET AND BY ROGER BARMNE THE
KING'S ADVOCATE THEY HAD NOT BEEN OBSTRUCTED AT THAT TIME BY THAT
LOFTY HEDGE OF QUIBBLES AND PROCEDURES WHICH THE TWO JURISCONSULTS
PLANTED THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
ALL WAS CLEAR
EXPEDITIOUS EXPLICIT
ONE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE POINT THEN AND AT THE
END OF EVERY PATH THERE WAS IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE WITHOUT THICKETS AND
WITHOUT TURNINGS THE WHEEL THE GIBBET OR THE PILLORY
ONE AT LEAST
KNEW WHITHER ONE WAS GOING
THE CLERK PRESENTED THE SENTENCE TO THE PROVOST WHO AFFIXED HIS SEAL TO
IT AND DEPARTED TO PURSUE HIS ROUND OF THE AUDIENCE HALL IN A FRAME
OF MIND WHICH SEEMED DESTINED TO FILL ALL THE JAILS IN PARIS THAT DAY
JEHAN FROLLO AND ROBIN POUSSEPAIN LAUGHED IN THEIR SLEEVES
QUASIMODO
GAZED ON THE WHOLE WITH AN INDIFFERENT AND ASTONISHED AIR
HOWEVER AT THE MOMENT WHEN MASTER FLORIAN BARBEDIENNE WAS READING THE
SENTENCE IN HIS TURN BEFORE SIGNING IT THE CLERK FELT HIMSELF MOVED
WITH PITY FOR THE POOR WRETCH OF A PRISONER AND IN THE HOPE OF
OBTAINING SOME MITIGATION OF THE PENALTY HE APPROACHED AS NEAR THE
AUDITOR'S EAR AS POSSIBLE AND SAID POINTING TO QUASIMODO THAT MAN IS
DEAF
HE HOPED THAT THIS COMMUNITY OF INFIRMITY WOULD AWAKEN MASTER FLORIAN'S
INTEREST IN BEHALF OF THE CONDEMNED MAN
BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE WE
HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THAT MASTER FLORIAN DID NOT CARE TO HAVE HIS
DEAFNESS NOTICED
IN THE NEXT PLACE HE WAS SO HARD OF HEARING THAT HE
DID NOT CATCH A SINGLE WORD OF WHAT THE CLERK SAID TO HIM NEVERTHELESS
HE WISHED TO HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF HEARING AND REPLIED AH AH THAT
IS DIFFERENT I DID NOT KNOW THAT
AN HOUR MORE OF THE PILLORY IN THAT
CASE
AND HE SIGNED THE SENTENCE THUS MODIFIED
'TIS WELL DONE SAID ROBIN POUSSEPAIN WHO CHERISHED A GRUDGE AGAINST
QUASIMODO
THAT WILL TEACH HIM TO HANDLE PEOPLE ROUGHLY
CHAPTER II
THE RAT HOLE
THE READER MUST PERMIT US TO TAKE HIM BACK TO THE PLACE DE GRVE WHICH
WE QUITTED YESTERDAY WITH GRINGOIRE IN ORDER TO FOLLOW LA ESMERALDA
IT IS TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING EVERYTHING IS INDICATIVE OF THE DAY
AFTER A FESTIVAL
THE PAVEMENT IS COVERED WITH RUBBISH RIBBONS RAGS
FEATHERS FROM TUFTS OF PLUMES DROPS OF WAX FROM THE TORCHES CRUMBS OF
THE PUBLIC FEAST
A GOODLY NUMBER OF BOURGEOIS ARE SAUNTERING AS WE
SAY HERE AND THERE TURNING OVER WITH THEIR FEET THE EXTINCT BRANDS OF
THE BONFIRE GOING INTO RAPTURES IN FRONT OF THE PILLAR HOUSE OVER THE
MEMORY OF THE FINE HANGINGS OF THE DAY BEFORE AND TO DAY STARING AT THE
NAILS THAT SECURED THEM A LAST PLEASURE
THE VENDERS OF CIDER AND BEER
ARE ROLLING THEIR BARRELS AMONG THE GROUPS
SOME BUSY PASSERS BY
COME AND GO
THE MERCHANTS CONVERSE AND CALL TO EACH OTHER FROM THE
THRESHOLDS OF THEIR SHOPS
THE FESTIVAL THE AMBASSADORS COPPENOLE
THE POPE OF THE FOOLS ARE IN ALL MOUTHS THEY VIE WITH EACH OTHER EACH
TRYING TO CRITICISE IT BEST AND LAUGH THE MOST
AND MEANWHILE FOUR
MOUNTED SERGEANTS WHO HAVE JUST POSTED THEMSELVES AT THE FOUR SIDES
OF THE PILLORY HAVE ALREADY CONCENTRATED AROUND THEMSELVES A GOODLY
PROPORTION OF THE POPULACE SCATTERED ON THE PLACE WHO CONDEMN
THEMSELVES TO IMMOBILITY AND FATIGUE IN THE HOPE OF A SMALL EXECUTION
IF THE READER AFTER HAVING CONTEMPLATED THIS LIVELY AND NOISY SCENE
WHICH IS BEING ENACTED IN ALL PARTS OF THE PLACE WILL NOW TRANSFER
HIS GAZE TOWARDS THAT ANCIENT DEMI GOTHIC DEMI ROMANESQUE HOUSE OF THE
TOUR ROLAND WHICH FORMS THE CORNER ON THE QUAY TO THE WEST HE WILL
OBSERVE AT THE ANGLE OF THE FAADE A LARGE PUBLIC BREVIARY WITH RICH
ILLUMINATIONS PROTECTED FROM THE RAIN BY A LITTLE PENTHOUSE AND FROM
THIEVES BY A SMALL GRATING WHICH HOWEVER PERMITS OF THE LEAVES BEING
TURNED
BESIDE THIS BREVIARY IS A NARROW ARCHED WINDOW CLOSED BY TWO
IRON BARS IN THE FORM OF A CROSS AND LOOKING ON THE SQUARE THE ONLY
OPENING WHICH ADMITS A SMALL QUANTITY OF LIGHT AND AIR TO A LITTLE CELL
WITHOUT A DOOR CONSTRUCTED ON THE GROUND FLOOR IN THE THICKNESS OF THE
WALLS OF THE OLD HOUSE AND FILLED WITH A PEACE ALL THE MORE PROFOUND
WITH A SILENCE ALL THE MORE GLOOMY BECAUSE A PUBLIC PLACE THE MOST
POPULOUS AND MOST NOISY IN PARIS SWARMS AND SHRIEKS AROUND IT
THIS LITTLE CELL HAD BEEN CELEBRATED IN PARIS FOR NEARLY THREE
CENTURIES EVER SINCE MADAME ROLANDE DE LA TOUR ROLAND IN MOURNING FOR
HER FATHER WHO DIED IN THE CRUSADES HAD CAUSED IT TO BE HOLLOWED OUT
IN THE WALL OF HER OWN HOUSE IN ORDER TO IMMURE HERSELF THERE FOREVER
KEEPING OF ALL HER PALACE ONLY THIS LODGING WHOSE DOOR WAS WALLED UP
AND WHOSE WINDOW STOOD OPEN WINTER AND SUMMER GIVING ALL THE REST TO
THE POOR AND TO GOD
THE AFFLICTED DAMSEL HAD IN FACT WAITED TWENTY
YEARS FOR DEATH IN THIS PREMATURE TOMB PRAYING NIGHT AND DAY FOR
THE SOUL OF HER FATHER SLEEPING IN ASHES WITHOUT EVEN A STONE FOR A
PILLOW CLOTHED IN A BLACK SACK AND SUBSISTING ON THE BREAD AND WATER
WHICH THE COMPASSION OF THE PASSERS BY LED THEM TO DEPOSIT ON THE LEDGE
OF HER WINDOW THUS RECEIVING CHARITY AFTER HAVING BESTOWED IT
AT HER
DEATH AT THE MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS PASSING TO THE OTHER SEPULCHRE SHE
HAD BEQUEATHED THIS ONE IN PERPETUITY TO AFFLICTED WOMEN MOTHERS
WIDOWS OR MAIDENS WHO SHOULD WISH TO PRAY MUCH FOR OTHERS OR FOR
THEMSELVES AND WHO SHOULD DESIRE TO INTER THEMSELVES ALIVE IN A GREAT
GRIEF OR A GREAT PENANCE
THE POOR OF HER DAY HAD MADE HER A FINE
FUNERAL WITH TEARS AND BENEDICTIONS BUT TO THEIR GREAT REGRET THE
PIOUS MAID HAD NOT BEEN CANONIZED FOR LACK OF INFLUENCE
THOSE AMONG
THEM WHO WERE A LITTLE INCLINED TO IMPIETY HAD HOPED THAT THE MATTER
MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN PARADISE MORE EASILY THAN AT ROME AND HAD
FRANKLY BESOUGHT GOD INSTEAD OF THE POPE IN BEHALF OF THE DECEASED
THE MAJORITY HAD CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HOLDING THE MEMORY OF ROLANDE
SACRED AND CONVERTING HER RAGS INTO RELICS
THE CITY ON ITS SIDE HAD
FOUNDED IN HONOR OF THE DAMOISELLE A PUBLIC BREVIARY WHICH HAD BEEN
FASTENED NEAR THE WINDOW OF THE CELL IN ORDER THAT PASSERS BY MIGHT
HALT THERE FROM TIME TO TIME WERE IT ONLY TO PRAY THAT PRAYER MIGHT
REMIND THEM OF ALMS AND THAT THE POOR RECLUSES HEIRESSES OF MADAME
ROLANDE'S VAULT MIGHT NOT DIE OUTRIGHT OF HUNGER AND FORGETFULNESS
MOREOVER THIS SORT OF TOMB WAS NOT SO VERY RARE A THING IN THE CITIES
OF THE MIDDLE AGES
ONE OFTEN ENCOUNTERED IN THE MOST FREQUENTED STREET
IN THE MOST CROWDED AND NOISY MARKET IN THE VERY MIDDLE UNDER THE FEET
OF THE HORSES UNDER THE WHEELS OF THE CARTS AS IT WERE A CELLAR A
WELL A TINY WALLED AND GRATED CABIN AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH A HUMAN
BEING PRAYED NIGHT AND DAY VOLUNTARILY DEVOTED TO SOME ETERNAL
LAMENTATION TO SOME GREAT EXPIATION
AND ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH THAT
STRANGE SPECTACLE WOULD AWAKEN IN US TO DAY THAT HORRIBLE CELL A SORT
OF INTERMEDIARY LINK BETWEEN A HOUSE AND THE TOMB THE CEMETERY AND
THE CITY THAT LIVING BEING CUT OFF FROM THE HUMAN COMMUNITY AND
THENCEFORTH RECKONED AMONG THE DEAD THAT LAMP CONSUMING ITS LAST DROP
OF OIL IN THE DARKNESS THAT REMNANT OF LIFE FLICKERING IN THE GRAVE
THAT BREATH THAT VOICE THAT ETERNAL PRAYER IN A BOX OF STONE
THAT FACE FOREVER TURNED TOWARDS THE OTHER WORLD THAT EYE ALREADY
ILLUMINATED WITH ANOTHER SUN THAT EAR PRESSED TO THE WALLS OF A TOMB
THAT SOUL A PRISONER IN THAT BODY THAT BODY A PRISONER IN THAT DUNGEON
CELL AND BENEATH THAT DOUBLE ENVELOPE OF FLESH AND GRANITE THE MURMUR
OF THAT SOUL IN PAIN NOTHING OF ALL THIS WAS PERCEIVED BY THE CROWD
THE PIETY OF THAT AGE NOT VERY SUBTLE NOR MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING DID
NOT SEE SO MANY FACETS IN AN ACT OF RELIGION
IT TOOK THE THING IN THE
BLOCK HONORED VENERATED HALLOWED THE SACRIFICE AT NEED BUT DID NOT
ANALYZE THE SUFFERINGS AND FELT BUT MODERATE PITY FOR THEM
IT BROUGHT
SOME PITTANCE TO THE MISERABLE PENITENT FROM TIME TO TIME LOOKED
THROUGH THE HOLE TO SEE WHETHER HE WERE STILL LIVING FORGOT HIS NAME
HARDLY KNEW HOW MANY YEARS AGO HE HAD BEGUN TO DIE AND TO THE STRANGER
WHO QUESTIONED THEM ABOUT THE LIVING SKELETON WHO WAS PERISHING IN THAT
CELLAR THE NEIGHBORS REPLIED SIMPLY IT IS THE RECLUSE
EVERYTHING WAS THEN VIEWED WITHOUT METAPHYSICS WITHOUT EXAGGERATION
WITHOUT MAGNIFYING GLASS WITH THE NAKED EYE
THE MICROSCOPE HAD NOT YET
BEEN INVENTED EITHER FOR THINGS OF MATTER OR FOR THINGS OF THE MIND
MOREOVER ALTHOUGH PEOPLE WERE BUT LITTLE SURPRISED BY IT THE EXAMPLES
OF THIS SORT OF CLOISTRATION IN THE HEARTS OF CITIES WERE IN TRUTH
FREQUENT AS WE HAVE JUST SAID
THERE WERE IN PARIS A CONSIDERABLE
NUMBER OF THESE CELLS FOR PRAYING TO GOD AND DOING PENANCE THEY WERE
NEARLY ALL OCCUPIED
IT IS TRUE THAT THE CLERGY DID NOT LIKE TO HAVE
THEM EMPTY SINCE THAT IMPLIED LUKEWARMNESS IN BELIEVERS AND THAT
LEPERS WERE PUT INTO THEM WHEN THERE WERE NO PENITENTS ON HAND
BESIDES
THE CELL ON THE GRVE THERE WAS ONE AT MONTFAUON ONE AT THE CHARNIER
DES INNOCENTS ANOTHER I HARDLY KNOW WHERE AT THE CLICHON HOUSE I
THINK OTHERS STILL AT MANY SPOTS WHERE TRACES OF THEM ARE FOUND IN
TRADITIONS IN DEFAULT OF MEMORIALS
THE UNIVERSITY HAD ALSO ITS OWN
ON
MOUNT SAINTE GENEVIVE A SORT OF JOB OF THE MIDDLE AGES FOR THE SPACE
OF THIRTY YEARS CHANTED THE SEVEN PENITENTIAL PSALMS ON A DUNGHILL AT
THE BOTTOM OF A CISTERN BEGINNING ANEW WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SINGING
LOUDEST AT NIGHT MAGNA VOCE PER UMBRAS AND TO DAY THE
ANTIQUARY FANCIES THAT HE HEARS HIS VOICE AS HE ENTERS THE RUE DU
PUITS QUI PARLE THE STREET OF THE SPEAKING WELL
TO CONFINE OURSELVES TO THE CELL IN THE TOUR ROLAND WE MUST SAY THAT
IT HAD NEVER LACKED RECLUSES
AFTER THE DEATH OF MADAME ROLAND IT
HAD STOOD VACANT FOR A YEAR OR TWO THOUGH RARELY
MANY WOMEN HAD COME
THITHER TO MOURN UNTIL THEIR DEATH FOR RELATIVES LOVERS FAULTS
PARISIAN MALICE WHICH THRUSTS ITS FINGER INTO EVERYTHING EVEN INTO
THINGS WHICH CONCERN IT THE LEAST AFFIRMED THAT IT HAD BEHELD BUT FEW
WIDOWS THERE
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FASHION OF THE EPOCH A LATIN INSCRIPTION ON THE
WALL INDICATED TO THE LEARNED PASSER BY THE PIOUS PURPOSE OF THIS CELL
THE CUSTOM WAS RETAINED UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY OF
EXPLAINING AN EDIFICE BY A BRIEF DEVICE INSCRIBED ABOVE THE DOOR
THUS ONE STILL READS IN FRANCE ABOVE THE WICKET OF THE PRISON IN THE
SEIGNORIAL MANSION OF TOURVILLE SILETO ET SPERA IN IRELAND BENEATH
THE ARMORIAL BEARINGS WHICH SURMOUNT THE GRAND DOOR TO FORTESCUE CASTLE
FORTE SCUTUM SALUS DUCUM IN ENGLAND OVER THE PRINCIPAL ENTRANCE
TO THE HOSPITABLE MANSION OF THE EARLS COWPER TUUM EST
AT THAT TIME
EVERY EDIFICE WAS A THOUGHT
AS THERE WAS NO DOOR TO THE WALLED CELL OF THE TOUR ROLAND THESE TWO
WORDS HAD BEEN CARVED IN LARGE ROMAN CAPITALS OVER THE WINDOW
TU ORA
AND THIS CAUSED THE PEOPLE WHOSE GOOD SENSE DOES NOT PERCEIVE SO MUCH
REFINEMENT IN THINGS AND LIKES TO TRANSLATE LUDOVICO MAGNO BY PORTE
SAINT DENIS TO GIVE TO THIS DARK GLOOMY DAMP CAVITY THE NAME OF
THE RAT HOLE AN EXPLANATION LESS SUBLIME PERHAPS THAN THE OTHER
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND MORE PICTURESQUE
CHAPTER III
HISTORY OF A LEAVENED CAKE OF MAIZE
AT THE EPOCH OF THIS HISTORY THE CELL IN THE TOUR ROLAND WAS OCCUPIED
IF THE READER DESIRES TO KNOW BY WHOM HE HAS ONLY TO LEND AN EAR TO THE
CONVERSATION OF THREE WORTHY GOSSIPS WHO AT THE MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE
DIRECTED HIS ATTENTION TO THE RAT HOLE WERE DIRECTING THEIR STEPS
TOWARDS THE SAME SPOT COMING UP ALONG THE WATER'S EDGE FROM THE
CHTELET TOWARDS THE GRVE
TWO OF THESE WOMEN WERE DRESSED LIKE GOOD BOURGEOISES OF PARIS
THEIR
FINE WHITE RUFFS THEIR PETTICOATS OF LINSEY WOOLSEY STRIPED RED AND
BLUE THEIR WHITE KNITTED STOCKINGS WITH CLOCKS EMBROIDERED IN COLORS
WELL DRAWN UPON THEIR LEGS THE SQUARE TOED SHOES OF TAWNY LEATHER WITH
BLACK SOLES AND ABOVE ALL THEIR HEADGEAR THAT SORT OF TINSEL HORN
LOADED DOWN WITH RIBBONS AND LACES WHICH THE WOMEN OF CHAMPAGNE STILL
WEAR IN COMPANY WITH THE GRENADIERS OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD OF RUSSIA
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THAT CLASS WIVES WHICH HOLDS THE MIDDLE
GROUND BETWEEN WHAT THE LACKEYS CALL A WOMAN AND WHAT THEY TERM A LADY
THEY WORE NEITHER RINGS NOR GOLD CROSSES AND IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT
IN THEIR EASE THIS DID NOT PROCEED FROM POVERTY BUT SIMPLY FROM
FEAR OF BEING FINED
THEIR COMPANION WAS ATTIRED IN VERY MUCH THE SAME
MANNER BUT THERE WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING ABOUT HER DRESS AND
BEARING WHICH SUGGESTED THE WIFE OF A PROVINCIAL NOTARY
ONE COULD SEE
BY THE WAY IN WHICH HER GIRDLE ROSE ABOVE HER HIPS THAT SHE HAD NOT
BEEN LONG IN PARIS ADD TO THIS A PLAITED TUCKER KNOTS OF RIBBON
ON HER SHOES AND THAT THE STRIPES OF HER PETTICOAT RAN HORIZONTALLY
INSTEAD OF VERTICALLY AND A THOUSAND OTHER ENORMITIES WHICH SHOCKED
GOOD TASTE
THE TWO FIRST WALKED WITH THAT STEP PECULIAR TO PARISIAN LADIES SHOWING
PARIS TO WOMEN FROM THE COUNTRY
THE PROVINCIAL HELD BY THE HAND A BIG
BOY WHO HELD IN HIS A LARGE FLAT CAKE
WE REGRET TO BE OBLIGED TO ADD THAT OWING TO THE RIGOR OF THE SEASON
HE WAS USING HIS TONGUE AS A HANDKERCHIEF
THE CHILD WAS MAKING THEM DRAG HIM ALONG NON PASSIBUS CEQUIS AS
VIRGIL SAYS AND STUMBLING AT EVERY MOMENT TO THE GREAT INDIGNATION OF
HIS MOTHER
IT IS TRUE THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT HIS CAKE MORE THAN AT THE
PAVEMENT
SOME SERIOUS MOTIVE NO DOUBT PREVENTED HIS BITING IT THE
CAKE FOR HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH GAZING TENDERLY AT IT
BUT THE
MOTHER SHOULD HAVE RATHER TAKEN CHARGE OF THE CAKE
IT WAS CRUEL TO MAKE
A TANTALUS OF THE CHUBBY CHECKED BOY
MEANWHILE THE THREE DEMOISELLES FOR THE NAME OF DAMES WAS THEN
RESERVED FOR NOBLE WOMEN WERE ALL TALKING AT ONCE
LET US MAKE HASTE DEMOISELLE MAHIETTE SAID THE YOUNGEST OF THE
THREE WHO WAS ALSO THE LARGEST TO THE PROVINCIAL I GREATLY FEAR THAT
WE SHALL ARRIVE TOO LATE THEY TOLD US AT THE CHTELET THAT THEY WERE
GOING TO TAKE HIM DIRECTLY TO THE PILLORY
AH BAH WHAT ARE YOU SAYING DEMOISELLE OUDARDE MUSNIER INTERPOSED
THE OTHER PARISIENNE
THERE ARE TWO HOURS YET TO THE PILLORY
WE HAVE
TIME ENOUGH
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY ONE PILLORIED MY DEAR MAHIETTE
YES SAID THE PROVINCIAL AT REIMS
AH BAH WHAT IS YOUR PILLORY AT REIMS A MISERABLE CAGE INTO WHICH
ONLY PEASANTS ARE TURNED
A GREAT AFFAIR TRULY
ONLY PEASANTS SAID MAHIETTE AT THE CLOTH MARKET IN REIMS WE HAVE
SEEN VERY FINE CRIMINALS THERE WHO HAVE KILLED THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER
PEASANTS FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE US GERVAISE
IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE PROVINCIAL WAS ON THE POINT OF TAKING OFFENCE
FOR THE HONOR OF HER PILLORY
FORTUNATELY THAT DISCREET DAMOISELLE
OUDARDE MUSNIER TURNED THE CONVERSATION IN TIME
BY THE WAY DAMOISELLE MAHIETTE WHAT SAY YOU TO OUR FLEMISH
AMBASSADORS HAVE YOU AS FINE ONES AT REIMS
I ADMIT REPLIED MAHIETTE THAT IT IS ONLY IN PARIS THAT SUCH
FLEMINGS CAN BE SEEN
DID YOU SEE AMONG THE EMBASSY THAT BIG AMBASSADOR WHO IS A HOSIER
ASKED OUDARDE
YES SAID MAHIETTE
HE HAS THE EYE OF A SATURN
AND THE BIG FELLOW WHOSE FACE RESEMBLES A BARE BELLY RESUMED
GERVAISE
AND THE LITTLE ONE WITH SMALL EYES FRAMED IN RED EYELIDS
PARED DOWN AND SLASHED UP LIKE A THISTLE HEAD
'TIS THEIR HORSES THAT ARE WORTH SEEING SAID OUDARDE CAPARISONED AS
THEY ARE AFTER THE FASHION OF THEIR COUNTRY
AH MY DEAR INTERRUPTED PROVINCIAL MAHIETTE ASSUMING IN HER TURN AN
AIR OF SUPERIORITY WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THEN IF YOU HAD SEEN IN '61 AT
THE CONSECRATION AT REIMS EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO THE HORSES OF THE PRINCES
AND OF THE KING'S COMPANY HOUSINGS AND CAPARISONS OF ALL SORTS SOME
OF DAMASK CLOTH OF FINE CLOTH OF GOLD FURRED WITH SABLES OTHERS OF
VELVET FURRED WITH ERMINE OTHERS ALL EMBELLISHED WITH GOLDSMITH'S WORK
AND LARGE BELLS OF GOLD AND SILVER AND WHAT MONEY THAT HAD COST AND
WHAT HANDSOME BOY PAGES RODE UPON THEM
THAT REPLIED OUDARDE DRYLY DOES NOT PREVENT THE FLEMINGS HAVING
VERY FINE HORSES AND HAVING HAD A SUPERB SUPPER YESTERDAY WITH
MONSIEUR THE PROVOST OF THE MERCHANTS AT THE HTEL DE VILLE WHERE
THEY WERE SERVED WITH COMFITS AND HIPPOCRAS AND SPICES AND OTHER
SINGULARITIES
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING NEIGHBOR EXCLAIMED GERVAISE
IT WAS WITH
MONSIEUR THE CARDINAL AT THE PETIT BOURBON THAT THEY SUPPED
NOT AT ALL
AT THE HTEL DE VILLE
YES INDEED
AT THE PETIT BOURBON
IT WAS AT THE HTEL DE VILLE RETORTED OUDARDE SHARPLY AND DR
SCOURABLE ADDRESSED THEM A HARANGUE IN LATIN WHICH PLEASED THEM
GREATLY
MY HUSBAND WHO IS SWORN BOOKSELLER TOLD ME
IT WAS AT THE PETIT BOURBON REPLIED GERVAISE WITH NO LESS SPIRIT
AND THIS IS WHAT MONSIEUR THE CARDINAL'S PROCURATOR PRESENTED TO THEM
TWELVE DOUBLE QUARTS OF HIPPOCRAS WHITE CLARET AND RED TWENTY FOUR
BOXES OF DOUBLE LYONS MARCHPANE GILDED AS MANY TORCHES WORTH TWO
LIVRES A PIECE AND SIX DEMI QUEUES OF BEAUNE WINE WHITE AND CLARET
THE BEST THAT COULD BE FOUND
I HAVE IT FROM MY HUSBAND WHO IS A
CINQUANTENIER AT THE PARLOIR AUX BOURGEOIS AND WHO WAS THIS MORNING
COMPARING THE FLEMISH AMBASSADORS WITH THOSE OF PRESTER JOHN AND THE
EMPEROR OF TREBIZOND WHO CAME FROM MESOPOTAMIA TO PARIS UNDER THE LAST
KING AND WHO WORE RINGS IN THEIR EARS
A QUEUE WAS A CASK WHICH HELD A HOGSHEAD AND A HALF
A CAPTAIN OF FIFTY MEN
SO TRUE IS IT THAT THEY SUPPED AT THE HTEL DE VILLE REPLIED OUDARDE
BUT LITTLE AFFECTED BY THIS CATALOGUE THAT SUCH A TRIUMPH OF VIANDS
AND COMFITS HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN
I TELL YOU THAT THEY WERE SERVED BY LE SEC SERGEANT OF THE CITY AT
THE HTEL DU PETIT BOURBON AND THAT THAT IS WHERE YOU ARE MISTAKEN
AT THE HTEL DE VILLE I TELL YOU
AT THE PETIT BOURBON MY DEAR AND THEY HAD ILLUMINATED WITH MAGIC
GLASSES THE WORD HOPE WHICH IS WRITTEN ON THE GRAND PORTAL
AT THE HTEL DE VILLE AT THE HTEL DE VILLE AND HUSSON LE VOIR PLAYED
THE FLUTE
I TELL YOU NO
I TELL YOU YES
I SAY NO
PLUMP AND WORTHY OUDARDE WAS PREPARING TO RETORT AND THE QUARREL MIGHT
PERHAPS HAVE PROCEEDED TO A PULLING OF CAPS HAD NOT MAHIETTE SUDDENLY
EXCLAIMED LOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE ASSEMBLED YONDER AT THE END OF THE
BRIDGE THERE IS SOMETHING IN THEIR MIDST THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT
IN SOOTH SAID GERVAISE I HEAR THE SOUNDS OF A TAMBOURINE
I BELIEVE
'TIS THE LITTLE ESMERALDA WHO PLAYS HER MUMMERIES WITH HER GOAT
EH
BE QUICK MAHIETTE REDOUBLE YOUR PACE AND DRAG ALONG YOUR BOY
YOU
ARE COME HITHER TO VISIT THE CURIOSITIES OF PARIS
YOU SAW THE FLEMINGS
YESTERDAY YOU MUST SEE THE GYPSY TO DAY
THE GYPSY SAID MAHIETTE SUDDENLY RETRACING HER STEPS AND CLASPING
HER SON'S ARM FORCIBLY
GOD PRESERVE ME FROM IT SHE WOULD STEAL MY
CHILD FROM ME COME EUSTACHE
AND SHE SET OUT ON A RUN ALONG THE QUAY TOWARDS THE GRVE UNTIL SHE HAD
LEFT THE BRIDGE FAR BEHIND HER
IN THE MEANWHILE THE CHILD WHOM SHE WAS
DRAGGING AFTER HER FELL UPON HIS KNEES SHE HALTED BREATHLESS
OUDARDE
AND GERVAISE REJOINED HER
THAT GYPSY STEAL YOUR CHILD FROM YOU SAID GERVAISE
THAT'S A
SINGULAR FREAK OF YOURS
MAHIETTE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A PENSIVE AIR
THE SINGULAR POINT IS OBSERVED OUDARDE THAT LA SACHETTE HAS THE
SAME IDEA ABOUT THE EGYPTIAN WOMAN
WHAT IS LA SACHETTE ASKED MAHIETTE
H SAID OUDARDE SISTER GUDULE
AND WHO IS SISTER GUDULE PERSISTED MAHIETTE
YOU ARE CERTAINLY IGNORANT OF ALL BUT YOUR REIMS NOT TO KNOW THAT
REPLIED OUDARDE
'TIS THE RECLUSE OF THE RAT HOLE
WHAT DEMANDED MAHIETTE THAT POOR WOMAN TO WHOM WE ARE CARRYING THIS
CAKE
OUDARDE NODDED AFFIRMATIVELY
PRECISELY
YOU WILL SEE HER PRESENTLY AT HER WINDOW ON THE GRVE
SHE
HAS THE SAME OPINION AS YOURSELF OF THESE VAGABONDS OF EGYPT WHO PLAY
THE TAMBOURINE AND TELL FORTUNES TO THE PUBLIC
NO ONE KNOWS WHENCE
COMES HER HORROR OF THE GYPSIES AND EGYPTIANS
BUT YOU MAHIETTE WHY DO
YOU RUN SO AT THE MERE SIGHT OF THEM
OH SAID MAHIETTE SEIZING HER CHILD'S ROUND HEAD IN BOTH HANDS
I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ME WHICH HAPPENED TO PAQUETTE LA
CHANTEFLEURIE
OH YOU MUST TELL US THAT STORY MY GOOD MAHIETTE SAID GERVAISE
TAKING HER ARM
GLADLY REPLIED MAHIETTE BUT YOU MUST BE IGNORANT OF ALL BUT YOUR
PARIS NOT TO KNOW THAT I WILL TELL YOU THEN BUT 'TIS NOT NECESSARY FOR
US TO HALT THAT I MAY TELL YOU THE TALE THAT PAQUETTE LA CHANTEFLEURIE
WAS A PRETTY MAID OF EIGHTEEN WHEN I WAS ONE MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY
EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO AND 'TIS HER OWN FAULT IF SHE IS NOT TO DAY LIKE
ME A GOOD PLUMP FRESH MOTHER OF SIX AND THIRTY WITH A HUSBAND AND A
SON
HOWEVER AFTER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN IT WAS TOO LATE WELL SHE WAS
THE DAUGHTER OF GUYBERTANT MINSTREL OF THE BARGES AT REIMS THE SAME
WHO HAD PLAYED BEFORE KING CHARLES VII AT HIS CORONATION WHEN HE
DESCENDED OUR RIVER VESLE FROM SILLERY TO MUISON WHEN MADAME THE MAID
OF ORLEANS WAS ALSO IN THE BOAT
THE OLD FATHER DIED WHEN PAQUETTE WAS
STILL A MERE CHILD SHE HAD THEN NO ONE BUT HER MOTHER THE SISTER OF
M
PRADON MASTER BRAZIER AND COPPERSMITH IN PARIS RUE FARM GARLIN WHO
DIED LAST YEAR
YOU SEE SHE WAS OF GOOD FAMILY
THE MOTHER WAS A GOOD
SIMPLE WOMAN UNFORTUNATELY AND SHE TAUGHT PAQUETTE NOTHING BUT A BIT
OF EMBROIDERY AND TOY MAKING WHICH DID NOT PREVENT THE LITTLE ONE FROM
GROWING VERY LARGE AND REMAINING VERY POOR
THEY BOTH DWELT AT REIMS
ON THE RIVER FRONT RUE DE FOLLE PEINE
MARK THIS FOR I BELIEVE IT
WAS THIS WHICH BROUGHT MISFORTUNE TO PAQUETTE
IN '61 THE YEAR OF THE
CORONATION OF OUR KING LOUIS XI
WHOM GOD PRESERVE PAQUETTE WAS SO GAY
AND SO PRETTY THAT SHE WAS CALLED EVERYWHERE BY NO OTHER NAME THAN LA
CHANTEFLEURIE BLOSSOMING SONG
POOR GIRL SHE HAD HANDSOME TEETH SHE
WAS FOND OF LAUGHING AND DISPLAYING THEM
NOW A MAID WHO LOVES TO LAUGH
IS ON THE ROAD TO WEEPING HANDSOME TEETH RUIN HANDSOME EYES
SO SHE WAS
LA CHANTEFLEURIE
SHE AND HER MOTHER EARNED A PRECARIOUS LIVING
THEY HAD BEEN VERY DESTITUTE SINCE THE DEATH OF THE MINSTREL THEIR
EMBROIDERY DID NOT BRING THEM IN MORE THAN SIX FARTHINGS A WEEK WHICH
DOES NOT AMOUNT TO QUITE TWO EAGLE LIARDS
WHERE WERE THE DAYS
WHEN FATHER GUYBERTANT HAD EARNED TWELVE SOUS PARISIAN IN A SINGLE
CORONATION WITH A SONG ONE WINTER IT WAS IN THAT SAME YEAR OF '61
WHEN THE TWO WOMEN HAD NEITHER FAGOTS NOR FIREWOOD IT WAS VERY COLD
WHICH GAVE LA CHANTEFLEURIE SUCH A FINE COLOR THAT THE MEN CALLED
HER PAQUETTE AND MANY CALLED HER PQUERETTE AND SHE WAS
RUINED EUSTACHE JUST LET ME SEE YOU BITE THAT CAKE IF YOU DARE WE
IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS RUINED ONE SUNDAY WHEN SHE CAME TO
CHURCH WITH A GOLD CROSS ABOUT HER NECK
AT FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE DO
YOU SEE FIRST IT WAS THE YOUNG VICOMTE DE CORMONTREUIL WHO HAS HIS
BELL TOWER THREE LEAGUES DISTANT FROM REIMS THEN MESSIRE HENRI
DE TRIANCOURT EQUERRY TO THE KING THEN LESS THAN THAT CHIART DE
BEAULION SERGEANT AT ARMS THEN STILL DESCENDING GUERY AUBERGEON
CARVER TO THE KING THEN MACE DE FRPUS BARBER TO MONSIEUR THE
DAUPHIN THEN THVENIN LE MOINE KING'S COOK THEN THE MEN GROWING
CONTINUALLY YOUNGER AND LESS NOBLE SHE FELL TO GUILLAUME RACINE
MINSTREL OF THE HURDY GURDY AND TO THIERRY DE MER LAMPLIGHTER
THEN
POOR CHANTEFLEURIE SHE BELONGED TO EVERY ONE SHE HAD REACHED THE LAST
SOU OF HER GOLD PIECE
WHAT SHALL I SAY TO YOU MY DAMOISELLES AT THE
CORONATION IN THE SAME YEAR '61 'TWAS SHE WHO MADE THE BED OF THE
KING OF THE DEBAUCHEES IN THE SAME YEAR
OX EYE DAISY
EASTER DAISY
MAHIETTE SIGHED AND WIPED AWAY A TEAR WHICH TRICKLED FROM HER EYES
THIS IS NO VERY EXTRAORDINARY HISTORY SAID GERVAISE AND IN THE
WHOLE OF IT I SEE NOTHING OF ANY EGYPTIAN WOMEN OR CHILDREN
PATIENCE RESUMED MAHIETTE YOU WILL SEE ONE CHILD IN '66 'TWILL
BE SIXTEEN YEARS AGO THIS MONTH AT SAINTE PAULE'S DAY PAQUETTE WAS
BROUGHT TO BED OF A LITTLE GIRL
THE UNHAPPY CREATURE IT WAS A GREAT
JOY TO HER SHE HAD LONG WISHED FOR A CHILD
HER MOTHER GOOD WOMAN WHO
HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT TO DO EXCEPT TO SHUT HER EYES HER MOTHER WAS DEAD
PAQUETTE HAD NO LONGER ANY ONE TO LOVE IN THE WORLD OR ANY ONE TO LOVE
HER
LA CHANTEFLEURIE HAD BEEN A POOR CREATURE DURING THE FIVE YEARS
SINCE HER FALL
SHE WAS ALONE ALONE IN THIS LIFE FINGERS WERE POINTED
AT HER SHE WAS HOOTED AT IN THE STREETS BEATEN BY THE SERGEANTS
JEERED AT BY THE LITTLE BOYS IN RAGS
AND THEN TWENTY HAD ARRIVED AND
TWENTY IS AN OLD AGE FOR AMOROUS WOMEN
FOLLY BEGAN TO BRING HER IN NO
MORE THAN HER TRADE OF EMBROIDERY IN FORMER DAYS FOR EVERY WRINKLE THAT
CAME A CROWN FLED WINTER BECAME HARD TO HER ONCE MORE WOOD BECAME
RARE AGAIN IN HER BRAZIER AND BREAD IN HER CUPBOARD
SHE COULD NO
LONGER WORK BECAUSE IN BECOMING VOLUPTUOUS SHE HAD GROWN LAZY AND SHE
SUFFERED MUCH MORE BECAUSE IN GROWING LAZY SHE HAD BECOME VOLUPTUOUS
AT LEAST THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH MONSIEUR THE CURE OF SAINT REMY
EXPLAINS WHY THESE WOMEN ARE COLDER AND HUNGRIER THAN OTHER POOR WOMEN
WHEN THEY ARE OLD
YES REMARKED GERVAISE BUT THE GYPSIES
ONE MOMENT GERVAISE SAID OUDARDE WHOSE ATTENTION WAS LESS
IMPATIENT
WHAT WOULD BE LEFT FOR THE END IF ALL WERE IN THE BEGINNING
CONTINUE MAHIETTE I ENTREAT YOU
THAT POOR CHANTEFLEURIE
MAHIETTE WENT ON
SO SHE WAS VERY SAD VERY MISERABLE AND FURROWED HER CHEEKS WITH
TEARS
BUT IN THE MIDST OF HER SHAME HER FOLLY HER DEBAUCHERY
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE SHOULD BE LESS WILD LESS SHAMEFUL LESS
DISSIPATED IF THERE WERE SOMETHING OR SOME ONE IN THE WORLD WHOM SHE
COULD LOVE AND WHO COULD LOVE HER
IT WAS NECESSARY THAT IT SHOULD BE A
CHILD BECAUSE ONLY A CHILD COULD BE SUFFICIENTLY INNOCENT FOR THAT
SHE
HAD RECOGNIZED THIS FACT AFTER HAVING TRIED TO LOVE A THIEF THE ONLY
MAN WHO WANTED HER BUT AFTER A SHORT TIME SHE PERCEIVED THAT THE THIEF
DESPISED HER
THOSE WOMEN OF LOVE REQUIRE EITHER A LOVER OR A CHILD TO
FILL THEIR HEARTS
OTHERWISE THEY ARE VERY UNHAPPY
AS SHE COULD NOT
HAVE A LOVER SHE TURNED WHOLLY TOWARDS A DESIRE FOR A CHILD AND AS SHE
HAD NOT CEASED TO BE PIOUS SHE MADE HER CONSTANT PRAYER TO THE GOOD
GOD FOR IT
SO THE GOOD GOD TOOK PITY ON HER AND GAVE HER A LITTLE
DAUGHTER
I WILL NOT SPEAK TO YOU OF HER JOY IT WAS A FURY OF
TEARS AND CARESSES AND KISSES
SHE NURSED HER CHILD HERSELF MADE
SWADDLING BANDS FOR IT OUT OF HER COVERLET THE ONLY ONE WHICH SHE
HAD ON HER BED AND NO LONGER FELT EITHER COLD OR HUNGER
SHE BECAME
BEAUTIFUL ONCE MORE IN CONSEQUENCE OF IT
AN OLD MAID MAKES A
YOUNG MOTHER
GALLANTRY CLAIMED HER ONCE MORE MEN CAME TO SEE LA
CHANTEFLEURIE SHE FOUND CUSTOMERS AGAIN FOR HER MERCHANDISE AND OUT
OF ALL THESE HORRORS SHE MADE BABY CLOTHES CAPS AND BIBS BODICES
WITH SHOULDER STRAPS OF LACE AND TINY BONNETS OF SATIN WITHOUT EVEN
THINKING OF BUYING HERSELF ANOTHER COVERLET MASTER EUSTACHE I HAVE
ALREADY TOLD YOU NOT TO EAT THAT CAKE IT IS CERTAIN THAT LITTLE AGNES
THAT WAS THE CHILD'S NAME A BAPTISMAL NAME FOR IT WAS A LONG TIME
SINCE LA CHANTEFLEURIE HAD HAD ANY SURNAME IT IS CERTAIN THAT
THAT LITTLE ONE WAS MORE SWATHED IN RIBBONS AND EMBROIDERIES THAN A
DAUPHINESS OF DAUPHINY AMONG OTHER THINGS SHE HAD A PAIR OF LITTLE
SHOES THE LIKE OF WHICH KING LOUIS XI
CERTAINLY NEVER HAD HER MOTHER
HAD STITCHED AND EMBROIDERED THEM HERSELF SHE HAD LAVISHED ON THEM ALL
THE DELICACIES OF HER ART OF EMBROIDERESS AND ALL THE EMBELLISHMENTS OF
A ROBE FOR THE GOOD VIRGIN
THEY CERTAINLY WERE THE TWO PRETTIEST LITTLE
PINK SHOES THAT COULD BE SEEN
THEY WERE NO LONGER THAN MY THUMB AND
ONE HAD TO SEE THE CHILD'S LITTLE FEET COME OUT OF THEM IN ORDER TO
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO THEM
'TIS TRUE THAT THOSE
LITTLE FEET WERE SO SMALL SO PRETTY SO ROSY ROSIER THAN THE SATIN OF
THE SHOES WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN OUDARDE YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE IS
NOTHING PRETTIER THAN THOSE LITTLE HANDS AND FEET
I ASK NO BETTER SAID OUDARDE WITH A SIGH BUT I AM WAITING UNTIL IT
SHALL SUIT THE GOOD PLEASURE OF M
ANDRY MUSNIER
HOWEVER PAQUETTE'S CHILD HAD MORE THAT WAS PRETTY ABOUT IT BESIDES ITS
FEET
I SAW HER WHEN SHE WAS ONLY FOUR MONTHS OLD SHE WAS A LOVE SHE
HAD EYES LARGER THAN HER MOUTH AND THE MOST CHARMING BLACK HAIR WHICH
ALREADY CURLED
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MAGNIFICENT BRUNETTE AT THE AGE
OF SIXTEEN HER MOTHER BECAME MORE CRAZY OVER HER EVERY DAY
SHE KISSED
HER CARESSED HER TICKLED HER WASHED HER DECKED HER OUT DEVOURED
HER SHE LOST HER HEAD OVER HER SHE THANKED GOD FOR HER
HER PRETTY
LITTLE ROSY FEET ABOVE ALL WERE AN ENDLESS SOURCE OF WONDERMENT THEY
WERE A DELIRIUM OF JOY SHE WAS ALWAYS PRESSING HER LIPS TO THEM AND
SHE COULD NEVER RECOVER FROM HER AMAZEMENT AT THEIR SMALLNESS
SHE PUT
THEM INTO THE TINY SHOES TOOK THEM OUT ADMIRED THEM MARVELLED AT
THEM LOOKED AT THE LIGHT THROUGH THEM WAS CURIOUS TO SEE THEM TRY TO
WALK ON HER BED AND WOULD GLADLY HAVE PASSED HER LIFE ON HER KNEES
PUTTING ON AND TAKING OFF THE SHOES FROM THOSE FEET AS THOUGH THEY HAD
BEEN THOSE OF AN INFANT JESUS
THE TALE IS FAIR AND GOOD SAID GERVAISE IN A LOW TONE BUT WHERE DO
GYPSIES COME INTO ALL THAT
HERE REPLIED MAHIETTE
ONE DAY THERE ARRIVED IN REIMS A VERY QUEER
SORT OF PEOPLE
THEY WERE BEGGARS AND VAGABONDS WHO WERE ROAMING OVER
THE COUNTRY LED BY THEIR DUKE AND THEIR COUNTS
THEY WERE BROWNED BY
EXPOSURE TO THE SUN THEY HAD CLOSELY CURLING HAIR AND SILVER RINGS IN
THEIR EARS
THE WOMEN WERE STILL UGLIER THAN THE MEN
THEY HAD BLACKER
FACES WHICH WERE ALWAYS UNCOVERED A MISERABLE FROCK ON THEIR BODIES
AN OLD CLOTH WOVEN OF CORDS BOUND UPON THEIR SHOULDER AND THEIR HAIR
HANGING LIKE THE TAIL OF A HORSE
THE CHILDREN WHO SCRAMBLED
BETWEEN THEIR LEGS WOULD HAVE FRIGHTENED AS MANY MONKEYS
A BAND OF
EXCOMMUNICATES
ALL THESE PERSONS CAME DIRECT FROM LOWER EGYPT TO
REIMS THROUGH POLAND
THE POPE HAD CONFESSED THEM IT WAS SAID AND HAD
PRESCRIBED TO THEM AS PENANCE TO ROAM THROUGH THE WORLD FOR SEVEN YEARS
WITHOUT SLEEPING IN A BED AND SO THEY WERE CALLED PENANCERS AND SMELT
HORRIBLY
IT APPEARS THAT THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN SARACENS WHICH WAS
WHY THEY BELIEVED IN JUPITER AND CLAIMED TEN LIVRES OF TOURNAY FROM ALL
ARCHBISHOPS BISHOPS AND MITRED ABBOTS WITH CROZIERS
A BULL FROM THE
POPE EMPOWERED THEM TO DO THAT
THEY CAME TO REIMS TO TELL FORTUNES IN
THE NAME OF THE KING OF ALGIERS AND THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY
YOU CAN
READILY IMAGINE THAT NO MORE WAS NEEDED TO CAUSE THE ENTRANCE TO THE
TOWN TO BE FORBIDDEN THEM
THEN THE WHOLE BAND CAMPED WITH GOOD GRACE
OUTSIDE THE GATE OF BRAINE ON THAT HILL WHERE STANDS A MILL BESIDE THE
CAVITIES OF THE ANCIENT CHALK PITS
AND EVERYBODY IN REIMS VIED WITH HIS
NEIGHBOR IN GOING TO SEE THEM
THEY LOOKED AT YOUR HAND AND TOLD YOU
MARVELLOUS PROPHECIES THEY WERE EQUAL TO PREDICTING TO JUDAS THAT HE
WOULD BECOME POPE
NEVERTHELESS UGLY RUMORS WERE IN CIRCULATION IN
REGARD TO THEM ABOUT CHILDREN STOLEN PURSES CUT AND HUMAN FLESH
DEVOURED
THE WISE PEOPLE SAID TO THE FOOLISH DON'T GO THERE AND
THEN WENT THEMSELVES ON THE SLY
IT WAS AN INFATUATION
THE FACT IS
THAT THEY SAID THINGS FIT TO ASTONISH A CARDINAL
MOTHERS TRIUMPHED
GREATLY OVER THEIR LITTLE ONES AFTER THE EGYPTIANS HAD READ IN THEIR
HANDS ALL SORTS OF MARVELS WRITTEN IN PAGAN AND IN TURKISH
ONE HAD AN
EMPEROR ANOTHER A POPE ANOTHER A CAPTAIN
POOR CHANTEFLEURIE WAS
SEIZED WITH CURIOSITY SHE WISHED TO KNOW ABOUT HERSELF AND WHETHER
HER PRETTY LITTLE AGNES WOULD NOT BECOME SOME DAY EMPRESS OF ARMENIA
OR SOMETHING ELSE
SO SHE CARRIED HER TO THE EGYPTIANS AND THE EGYPTIAN
WOMEN FELL TO ADMIRING THE CHILD AND TO CARESSING IT AND TO KISSING IT
WITH THEIR BLACK MOUTHS AND TO MARVELLING OVER ITS LITTLE BAND ALAS
TO THE GREAT JOY OF THE MOTHER
THEY WERE ESPECIALLY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER
HER PRETTY FEET AND SHOES
THE CHILD WAS NOT YET A YEAR OLD
SHE ALREADY
LISPED A LITTLE LAUGHED AT HER MOTHER LIKE A LITTLE MAD THING WAS
PLUMP AND QUITE ROUND AND POSSESSED A THOUSAND CHARMING LITTLE GESTURES
OF THE ANGELS OF PARADISE
SHE WAS VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED BY THE EGYPTIANS AND WEPT
BUT HER MOTHER
KISSED HER MORE WARMLY AND WENT AWAY ENCHANTED WITH THE GOOD FORTUNE
WHICH THE SOOTHSAYERS HAD FORETOLD FOR HER AGNES
SHE WAS TO BE A
BEAUTY VIRTUOUS A QUEEN
SO SHE RETURNED TO HER ATTIC IN THE RUE
FOLLE PEINE VERY PROUD OF BEARING WITH HER A QUEEN
THE NEXT DAY SHE
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN THE CHILD WAS ASLEEP ON HER BED FOR
THEY ALWAYS SLEPT TOGETHER GENTLY LEFT THE DOOR A LITTLE WAY OPEN AND
RAN TO TELL A NEIGHBOR IN THE RUE DE LA SCHESSERIE THAT THE DAY WOULD
COME WHEN HER DAUGHTER AGNES WOULD BE SERVED AT TABLE BY THE KING OF
ENGLAND AND THE ARCHDUKE OF ETHIOPIA AND A HUNDRED OTHER MARVELS
ON
HER RETURN HEARING NO CRIES ON THE STAIRCASE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
'GOOD THE CHILD IS STILL ASLEEP SHE FOUND HER DOOR WIDER OPEN THAN
SHE HAD LEFT IT BUT SHE ENTERED POOR MOTHER AND RAN TO THE BED THE
CHILD WAS NO LONGER THERE THE PLACE WAS EMPTY
NOTHING REMAINED OF THE
CHILD BUT ONE OF HER PRETTY LITTLE SHOES
SHE FLEW OUT OF THE ROOM
DASHED DOWN THE STAIRS AND BEGAN TO BEAT HER HEAD AGAINST THE WALL
CRYING 'MY CHILD WHO HAS MY CHILD WHO HAS TAKEN MY CHILD THE STREET
WAS DESERTED THE HOUSE ISOLATED NO ONE COULD TELL HER ANYTHING ABOUT
IT
SHE WENT ABOUT THE TOWN SEARCHED ALL THE STREETS RAN HITHER AND
THITHER THE WHOLE DAY LONG WILD BESIDE HERSELF TERRIBLE SNUFFING AT
DOORS AND WINDOWS LIKE A WILD BEAST WHICH HAS LOST ITS YOUNG
SHE WAS
BREATHLESS DISHEVELLED FRIGHTFUL TO SEE AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN HER
EYES WHICH DRIED HER TEARS
SHE STOPPED THE PASSERS BY AND CRIED 'MY
DAUGHTER MY DAUGHTER MY PRETTY LITTLE DAUGHTER IF ANY ONE WILL GIVE
ME BACK MY DAUGHTER I WILL BE HIS SERVANT THE SERVANT OF HIS DOG AND
HE SHALL EAT MY HEART IF HE WILL SHE MET M
LE CUR OF SAINT REMY AND
SAID TO HIM 'MONSIEUR I WILL TILL THE EARTH WITH MY FINGER NAILS BUT
GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD IT WAS HEARTRENDING OUDARDE AND IL SAW A VERY
HARD MAN MASTER PONCE LACABRE THE PROCURATOR WEEP
AH POOR MOTHER
IN THE EVENING SHE RETURNED HOME
DURING HER ABSENCE A NEIGHBOR HAD
SEEN TWO GYPSIES ASCEND UP TO IT WITH A BUNDLE IN THEIR ARMS THEN
DESCEND AGAIN AFTER CLOSING THE DOOR
AFTER THEIR DEPARTURE SOMETHING
LIKE THE CRIES OF A CHILD WERE HEARD IN PAQUETTE'S ROOM
THE MOTHER
BURST INTO SHRIEKS OF LAUGHTER ASCENDED THE STAIRS AS THOUGH ON WINGS
AND ENTERED A FRIGHTFUL THING TO TELL OUDARDE INSTEAD OF HER PRETTY
LITTLE AGNES SO ROSY AND SO FRESH WHO WAS A GIFT OF THE GOOD GOD A
SORT OF HIDEOUS LITTLE MONSTER LAME ONE EYED DEFORMED WAS CRAWLING
AND SQUALLING OVER THE FLOOR
SHE HID HER EYES IN HORROR
'OH SAID
SHE 'HAVE THE WITCHES TRANSFORMED MY DAUGHTER INTO THIS HORRIBLE
ANIMAL THEY HASTENED TO CARRY AWAY THE LITTLE CLUB FOOT HE WOULD HAVE
DRIVEN HER MAD
IT WAS THE MONSTROUS CHILD OF SOME GYPSY WOMAN WHO HAD
GIVEN HERSELF TO THE DEVIL
HE APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FOUR YEARS OLD
AND TALKED A LANGUAGE WHICH WAS NO HUMAN TONGUE THERE WERE WORDS IN IT
WHICH WERE IMPOSSIBLE
LA CHANTEFLEURIE FLUNG HERSELF UPON THE LITTLE
SHOE ALL THAT REMAINED TO HER OF ALL THAT SHE LOVED
SHE REMAINED SO
LONG MOTIONLESS OVER IT MUTE AND WITHOUT BREATH THAT THEY THOUGHT SHE
WAS DEAD
SUDDENLY SHE TREMBLED ALL OVER COVERED HER RELIC WITH FURIOUS
KISSES AND BURST OUT SOBBING AS THOUGH HER HEART WERE BROKEN
I ASSURE
YOU THAT WE WERE ALL WEEPING ALSO
SHE SAID 'OH MY LITTLE DAUGHTER MY
PRETTY LITTLE DAUGHTER WHERE ART THOU AND IT WRUNG YOUR VERY HEART
I WEEP STILL WHEN I THINK OF IT
OUR CHILDREN ARE THE MARROW OF OUR
BONES YOU SEE MY POOR EUSTACHE THOU ART SO FAIR IF YOU ONLY KNEW
HOW NICE HE IS YESTERDAY HE SAID TO ME 'I WANT TO BE A GENDARME
THAT I DO OH MY EUSTACHE IF I WERE TO LOSE THEE ALL AT ONCE LA
CHANTEFLEURIE ROSE AND SET OUT TO RUN THROUGH REIMS SCREAMING 'TO THE
GYPSIES' CAMP TO THE GYPSIES' CAMP POLICE TO BURN THE WITCHES THE
GYPSIES WERE GONE
IT WAS PITCH DARK
THEY COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED
ON THE
MORROW TWO LEAGUES FROM REIMS ON A HEATH BETWEEN GUEUX AND TILLOY THE
REMAINS OF A LARGE FIRE WERE FOUND SOME RIBBONS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO
PAQUETTE'S CHILD DROPS OF BLOOD AND THE DUNG OF A RAM
THE NIGHT
JUST PAST HAD BEEN A SATURDAY
THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY DOUBT THAT
THE EGYPTIANS HAD HELD THEIR SABBATH ON THAT HEATH AND THAT THEY HAD
DEVOURED THE CHILD IN COMPANY WITH BEELZEBUB AS THE PRACTICE IS AMONG
THE MAHOMETANS
WHEN LA CHANTEFLEURIE LEARNED THESE HORRIBLE THINGS SHE
DID NOT WEEP SHE MOVED HER LIPS AS THOUGH TO SPEAK BUT COULD NOT
ON
THE MORROW HER HAIR WAS GRAY
ON THE SECOND DAY SHE HAD DISAPPEARED
'TIS IN TRUTH A FRIGHTFUL TALE SAID OUDARDE AND ONE WHICH WOULD
MAKE EVEN A BURGUNDIAN WEEP
I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED ADDED GERVAISE THAT FEAR OF THE GYPSIES
SHOULD SPUR YOU ON SO SHARPLY
AND YOU DID ALL THE BETTER RESUMED OUDARDE TO FLEE WITH YOUR
EUSTACHE JUST NOW SINCE THESE ALSO ARE GYPSIES FROM POLAND
NO SAID GERVAIS 'TIS SAID THAT THEY COME FROM SPAIN AND CATALONIA
CATALONIA 'TIS POSSIBLE REPLIED OUDARDE
POLOGNE CATALOGUE
VALOGNE I ALWAYS CONFOUND THOSE THREE PROVINCES ONE THING IS CERTAIN
THAT THEY ARE GYPSIES
WHO CERTAINLY ADDED GERVAISE HAVE TEETH LONG ENOUGH TO EAT LITTLE
CHILDREN
I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF LA SMRALDA ATE A LITTLE OF THEM
ALSO THOUGH SHE PRETENDS TO BE DAINTY
HER WHITE GOAT KNOWS TRICKS THAT
ARE TOO MALICIOUS FOR THERE NOT TO BE SOME IMPIETY UNDERNEATH IT ALL
MAHIETTE WALKED ON IN SILENCE
SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THAT REVERY WHICH IS
IN SOME SORT THE CONTINUATION OF A MOURNFUL TALE AND WHICH ENDS ONLY
AFTER HAVING COMMUNICATED THE EMOTION FROM VIBRATION TO VIBRATION EVEN
TO THE VERY LAST FIBRES OF THE HEART
NEVERTHELESS GERVAISE ADDRESSED
HER AND DID THEY EVER LEARN WHAT BECAME OF LA CHANTEFLEURIE MAHIETTE
MADE NO REPLY
GERVAISE REPEATED HER QUESTION AND SHOOK HER ARM
CALLING HER BY NAME
MAHIETTE APPEARED TO AWAKEN FROM HER THOUGHTS
WHAT BECAME OF LA CHANTEFLEURIE SHE SAID REPEATING MECHANICALLY
THE WORDS WHOSE IMPRESSION WAS STILL FRESH IN HER EAR THEN MA KING AN
EFFORT TO RECALL HER ATTENTION TO THE MEANING OF HER WORDS AH SHE
CONTINUED BRISKLY NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT
SHE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE
SOME SAID THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEEN TO QUIT REIMS AT NIGHTFALL BY THE
FLCHEMBAULT GATE OTHERS AT DAYBREAK BY THE OLD BASE GATE
A POOR
MAN FOUND HER GOLD CROSS HANGING ON THE STONE CROSS IN THE FIELD WHERE
THE FAIR IS HELD
IT WAS THAT ORNAMENT WHICH HAD WROUGHT HER RUIN IN
'61
IT WAS A GIFT FROM THE HANDSOME VICOMTE DE CORMONTREUIL HER FIRST
LOVER
PAQUETTE HAD NEVER BEEN WILLING TO PART WITH IT WRETCHED AS SHE
HAD BEEN
SHE HAD CLUNG TO IT AS TO LIFE ITSELF
SO WHEN WE SAW THAT
CROSS ABANDONED WE ALL THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS DEAD
NEVERTHELESS THERE
WERE PEOPLE OF THE CABARET LES VANTES WHO SAID THAT THEY HAD SEEN HER
PASS ALONG THE ROAD TO PARIS WALKING ON THE PEBBLES WITH HER BARE FEET
BUT IN THAT CASE SHE MUST HAVE GONE OUT THROUGH THE PORTE DE VESLE
AND ALL THIS DOES NOT AGREE
OR TO SPEAK MORE TRULY I BELIEVE THAT
SHE ACTUALLY DID DEPART BY THE PORTE DE VESLE BUT DEPARTED FROM THIS
WORLD
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SAID GERVAISE
LA VESLE REPLIED MAHIETTE WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE IS THE RIVER
POOR CHANTEFLEURIE SAID OUDARDE WITH A SHIVER DROWNED
DROWNED RESUMED MAHIETTE WHO COULD HAVE TOLD GOOD FATHER
GUYBERTANT WHEN HE PASSED UNDER THE BRIDGE OF TINGUEUX WITH THE
CURRENT SINGING IN HIS BARGE THAT ONE DAY HIS DEAR LITTLE PAQUETTE
WOULD ALSO PASS BENEATH THAT BRIDGE BUT WITHOUT SONG OR BOAT
AND THE LITTLE SHOE ASKED GERVAISE
DISAPPEARED WITH THE MOTHER REPLIED MAHIETTE
POOR LITTLE SHOE SAID OUDARDE
OUDARDE A BIG AND TENDER WOMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL PLEASED TO SIGH IN
COMPANY WITH MAHIETTE
BUT GERVAISE MORE CURIOUS HAD NOT FINISHED HER
QUESTIONS
AND THE MONSTER SHE SAID SUDDENLY TO MAHIETTE
WHAT MONSTER INQUIRED THE LATTER
THE LITTLE GYPSY MONSTER LEFT BY THE SORCERESSES IN CHANTEFLEURIE'S
CHAMBER IN EXCHANGE FOR HER DAUGHTER
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT I HOPE
YOU DROWNED IT ALSO
NO REPLIED MAHIETTE
WHAT YOU BURNED IT THEN IN SOOTH THAT IS MORE JUST
A WITCH CHILD
NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER GERVAISE
MONSEIGNEUR THE ARCHBISHOP
INTERESTED HIMSELF IN THE CHILD OF EGYPT EXORCISED IT BLESSED IT
REMOVED THE DEVIL CAREFULLY FROM ITS BODY AND SENT IT TO PARIS TO BE
EXPOSED ON THE WOODEN BED AT NOTRE DAME AS A FOUNDLING
THOSE BISHOPS GRUMBLED GERVAISE BECAUSE THEY ARE LEARNED THEY DO
NOTHING LIKE ANYBODY ELSE
I JUST PUT IT TO YOU OUDARDE THE IDEA OF
PLACING THE DEVIL AMONG THE FOUNDLINGS FOR THAT LITTLE MONSTER WAS
ASSUREDLY THE DEVIL
WELL MAHIETTE WHAT DID THEY DO WITH IT IN PARIS
I AM QUITE SURE THAT NO CHARITABLE PERSON WANTED IT
I DO NOT KNOW REPLIED THE RMOISE 'TWAS JUST AT THAT TIME THAT MY
HUSBAND BOUGHT THE OFFICE OF NOTARY AT BERN TWO LEAGUES FROM THE TOWN
AND WE WERE NO LONGER OCCUPIED WITH THAT STORY BESIDES IN FRONT
OF BERN STAND THE TWO HILLS OF CERNAY WHICH HIDE THE TOWERS OF THE
CATHEDRAL IN REIMS FROM VIEW
WHILE CHATTING THUS THE THREE WORTHY BOURGEOISES HAD ARRIVED AT THE
PLACE DE GRVE
IN THEIR ABSORPTION THEY HAD PASSED THE PUBLIC BREVIARY
OF THE TOUR ROLAND WITHOUT STOPPING AND TOOK THEIR WAY MECHANICALLY
TOWARDS THE PILLORY AROUND WHICH THE THRONG WAS GROWING MORE DENSE WITH
EVERY MOMENT
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SPECTACLE WHICH AT THAT MOMENT
ATTRACTED ALL LOOKS IN THAT DIRECTION WOULD HAVE MADE THEM FORGET
COMPLETELY THE RAT HOLE AND THE HALT WHICH THEY INTENDED TO MAKE THERE
IF BIG EUSTACHE SIX YEARS OF AGE WHOM MAHIETTE WAS DRAGGING ALONG BY
THE HAND HAD NOT ABRUPTLY RECALLED THE OBJECT TO THEM MOTHER SAID
HE AS THOUGH SOME INSTINCT WARNED HIM THAT THE RAT HOLE WAS BEHIND HIM
CAN I EAT THE CAKE NOW
IF EUSTACHE HAD BEEN MORE ADROIT THAT IS TO SAY LESS GREEDY HE
WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO WAIT AND WOULD ONLY HAVE HAZARDED THAT SIMPLE
QUESTION MOTHER CAN I EAT THE CAKE NOW ON THEIR RETURN TO THE
UNIVERSITY TO MASTER ANDRY MUSNIER'S RUE MADAME LA VALENCE WHEN HE
HAD THE TWO ARMS OF THE SEINE AND THE FIVE BRIDGES OF THE CITY BETWEEN
THE RAT HOLE AND THE CAKE
THIS QUESTION HIGHLY IMPRUDENT AT THE MOMENT WHEN EUSTACHE PUT IT
AROUSED MAHIETTE'S ATTENTION
BY THE WAY SHE EXCLAIMED WE ARE FORGETTING THE RECLUSE SHOW ME THE
RAT HOLE THAT I MAY CARRY HER HER CAKE
IMMEDIATELY SAID OUDARDE 'TIS A CHARITY
BUT THIS DID NOT SUIT EUSTACHE
STOP MY CAKE SAID HE RUBBING BOTH EARS ALTERNATIVELY WITH HIS
SHOULDERS WHICH IN SUCH CASES IS THE SUPREME SIGN OF DISCONTENT
THE THREE WOMEN RETRACED THEIR STEPS AND ON ARRIVING IN THE VICINITY
OF THE TOUR ROLAND OUDARDE SAID TO THE OTHER TWO
WE MUST NOT ALL THREE GAZE INTO THE HOLE AT ONCE FOR FEAR OF ALARMING
THE RECLUSE
DO YOU TWO PRETEND TO READ THE DOMINUS IN THE BREVIARY
WHILE I THRUST MY NOSE INTO THE APERTURE THE RECLUSE KNOWS ME A LITTLE
I WILL GIVE YOU WARNING WHEN YOU CAN APPROACH
SHE PROCEEDED ALONE TO THE WINDOW
AT THE MOMENT WHEN SHE LOOKED IN
A PROFOUND PITY WAS DEPICTED ON ALL HER FEATURES AND HER FRANK GAY
VISAGE ALTERED ITS EXPRESSION AND COLOR AS ABRUPTLY AS THOUGH IT HAD
PASSED FROM A RAY OF SUNLIGHT TO A RAY OF MOONLIGHT HER EYE BECAME
HUMID HER MOUTH CONTRACTED LIKE THAT OF A PERSON ON THE POINT OF
WEEPING
A MOMENT LATER SHE LAID HER FINGER ON HER LIPS AND MADE A
SIGN TO MAHIETTE TO DRAW NEAR AND LOOK
MAHIETTE MUCH TOUCHED STEPPED UP IN SILENCE ON TIPTOE AS THOUGH
APPROACHING THE BEDSIDE OF A DYING PERSON
IT WAS IN FACT A MELANCHOLY SPECTACLE WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO
THE EYES OF THE TWO WOMEN AS THEY GAZED THROUGH THE GRATING OF THE
RAT HOLE NEITHER STIRRING NOR BREATHING
THE CELL WAS SMALL BROADER THAN IT WAS LONG WITH AN ARCHED CEILING
AND VIEWED FROM WITHIN IT BORE A CONSIDERABLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE
INTERIOR OF A HUGE BISHOP'S MITRE
ON THE BARE FLAGSTONES WHICH FORMED
THE FLOOR IN ONE CORNER A WOMAN WAS SITTING OR RATHER CROUCHING
HER
CHIN RESTED ON HER KNEES WHICH HER CROSSED ARMS PRESSED FORCIBLY TO
HER BREAST
THUS DOUBLED UP CLAD IN A BROWN SACK WHICH ENVELOPED
HER ENTIRELY IN LARGE FOLDS HER LONG GRAY HAIR PULLED OVER IN FRONT
FALLING OVER HER FACE AND ALONG HER LEGS NEARLY TO HER FEET SHE
PRESENTED AT THE FIRST GLANCE ONLY A STRANGE FORM OUTLINED AGAINST THE
DARK BACKGROUND OF THE CELL A SORT OF DUSKY TRIANGLE WHICH THE RAY OF
DAYLIGHT FALLING THROUGH THE OPENING CUT ROUGHLY INTO TWO SHADES THE
ONE SOMBRE THE OTHER ILLUMINATED
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SPECTRES
HALF LIGHT HALF SHADOW SUCH AS ONE BEHOLDS IN DREAMS AND IN THE
EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF GOYA PALE MOTIONLESS SINISTER CROUCHING OVER A
TOMB OR LEANING AGAINST THE GRATING OF A PRISON CELL
IT WAS NEITHER A WOMAN NOR A MAN NOR A LIVING BEING NOR A DEFINITE
FORM IT WAS A FIGURE A SORT OF VISION IN WHICH THE REAL AND THE
FANTASTIC INTERSECTED EACH OTHER LIKE DARKNESS AND DAY
IT WAS WITH
DIFFICULTY THAT ONE DISTINGUISHED BENEATH HER HAIR WHICH SPREAD TO
THE GROUND A GAUNT AND SEVERE PROFILE HER DRESS BARELY ALLOWED THE
EXTREMITY OF A BARE FOOT TO ESCAPE WHICH CONTRACTED ON THE HARD COLD
PAVEMENT
THE LITTLE OF HUMAN FORM OF WHICH ONE CAUGHT A SIGHT BENEATH
THIS ENVELOPE OF MOURNING CAUSED A SHUDDER
THAT FIGURE WHICH ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED TO BE RIVETED TO THE
FLAGSTONES APPEARED TO POSSESS NEITHER MOVEMENT NOR THOUGHT NOR
BREATH
LYING IN JANUARY IN THAT THIN LINEN SACK LYING ON A GRANITE
FLOOR WITHOUT FIRE IN THE GLOOM OF A CELL WHOSE OBLIQUE AIR HOLE
ALLOWED ONLY THE COLD BREEZE BUT NEVER THE SUN TO ENTER FROM WITHOUT
SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO SUFFER OR EVEN TO THINK
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT
SHE HAD TURNED TO STONE WITH THE CELL ICE WITH THE SEASON
HER HANDS
WERE CLASPED HER EYES FIXED
AT FIRST SIGHT ONE TOOK HER FOR A SPECTRE
AT THE SECOND FOR A STATUE
NEVERTHELESS AT INTERVALS HER BLUE LIPS HALF OPENED TO ADMIT A BREATH
AND TREMBLED BUT AS DEAD AND AS MECHANICAL AS THE LEAVES WHICH THE WIND
SWEEPS ASIDE
NEVERTHELESS FROM HER DULL EYES THERE ESCAPED A LOOK AN INEFFABLE
LOOK A PROFOUND LUGUBRIOUS IMPERTURBABLE LOOK INCESSANTLY FIXED UPON
A CORNER OF THE CELL WHICH COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM WITHOUT A GAZE WHICH
SEEMED TO FIX ALL THE SOMBRE THOUGHTS OF THAT SOUL IN DISTRESS UPON SOME
MYSTERIOUS OBJECT
SUCH WAS THE CREATURE WHO HAD RECEIVED FROM HER HABITATION THE NAME OF
THE RECLUSE AND FROM HER GARMENT THE NAME OF THE SACKED NUN
THE THREE WOMEN FOR GERVAISE HAD REJOINED MAHIETTE AND OUDARDE GAZED
THROUGH THE WINDOW
THEIR HEADS INTERCEPTED THE FEEBLE LIGHT IN THE
CELL WITHOUT THE WRETCHED BEING WHOM THEY THUS DEPRIVED OF IT SEEMING
TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM
DO NOT LET US TROUBLE HER SAID OUDARDE
IN A LOW VOICE SHE IS IN HER ECSTASY SHE IS PRAYING
MEANWHILE MAHIETTE WAS GAZING WITH EVER INCREASING ANXIETY AT THAT WAN
WITHERED DISHEVELLED HEAD AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
THIS IS
VERY SINGULAR SHE MURMURED
SHE THRUST HER HEAD THROUGH THE BARS AND SUCCEEDED IN CASTING A GLANCE
AT THE CORNER WHERE THE GAZE OF THE UNHAPPY WOMAN WAS IMMOVABLY RIVETED
WHEN SHE WITHDREW HER HEAD FROM THE WINDOW HER COUNTENANCE WAS
INUNDATED WITH TEARS
WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT WOMAN SHE ASKED OUDARDE
OUDARDE REPLIED
WE CALL HER SISTER GUDULE
AND I RETURNED MAHIETTE CALL HER PAQUETTE LA CHANTEFLEURIE
THEN LAYING HER FINGER ON HER LIPS SHE MOTIONED TO THE ASTOUNDED
OUDARDE TO THRUST HER HEAD THROUGH THE WINDOW AND LOOK
OUDARDE LOOKED AND BEHELD IN THE CORNER WHERE THE EYES OF THE
RECLUSE WERE FIXED IN THAT SOMBRE ECSTASY A TINY SHOE OF PINK SATIN
EMBROIDERED WITH A THOUSAND FANCIFUL DESIGNS IN GOLD AND SILVER
GERVAISE LOOKED AFTER OUDARDE AND THEN THE THREE WOMEN GAZING UPON THE
UNHAPPY MOTHER BEGAN TO WEEP
BUT NEITHER THEIR LOOKS NOR THEIR TEARS DISTURBED THE RECLUSE
HER HANDS
REMAINED CLASPED HER LIPS MUTE HER EYES FIXED AND THAT LITTLE SHOE
THUS GAZED AT BROKE THE HEART OF ANY ONE WHO KNEW HER HISTORY
THE THREE WOMEN HAD NOT YET UTTERED A SINGLE WORD THEY DARED NOT SPEAK
EVEN IN A LOW VOICE
THIS DEEP SILENCE THIS DEEP GRIEF THIS PROFOUND
OBLIVION IN WHICH EVERYTHING HAD DISAPPEARED EXCEPT ONE THING PRODUCED
UPON THEM THE EFFECT OF THE GRAND ALTAR AT CHRISTMAS OR EASTER
THEY
REMAINED SILENT THEY MEDITATED THEY WERE READY TO KNEEL
IT SEEMED TO
THEM THAT THEY WERE READY TO ENTER A CHURCH ON THE DAY OF TENEBRAE
AT LENGTH GERVAISE THE MOST CURIOUS OF THE THREE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE
LEAST SENSITIVE TRIED TO MAKE THE RECLUSE SPEAK
SISTER SISTER GUDULE
SHE REPEATED THIS CALL THREE TIMES RAISING HER VOICE EACH TIME
THE
RECLUSE DID NOT MOVE NOT A WORD NOT A GLANCE NOT A SIGH NOT A SIGN
OF LIFE
OUDARDE IN HER TURN IN A SWEETER MORE CARESSING VOICE SISTER
SAID SHE SISTER SAINTE GUDULE
THE SAME SILENCE THE SAME IMMOBILITY
A SINGULAR WOMAN EXCLAIMED GERVAISE AND ONE NOT TO BE MOVED BY A
CATAPULT
PERCHANCE SHE IS DEAF SAID OUDARDE
PERHAPS SHE IS BLIND ADDED GERVAISE
DEAD PERCHANCE RETURNED MAHIETTE
IT IS CERTAIN THAT IF THE SOUL HAD NOT ALREADY QUITTED THIS INERT
SLUGGISH LETHARGIC BODY IT HAD AT LEAST RETREATED AND CONCEALED ITSELF
IN DEPTHS WHITHER THE PERCEPTIONS OF THE EXTERIOR ORGANS NO LONGER
PENETRATED
THEN WE MUST LEAVE THE CAKE ON THE WINDOW SAID OUDARDE SOME SCAMP
WILL TAKE IT
WHAT SHALL WE DO TO ROUSE HER
EUSTACHE WHO UP TO THAT MOMENT HAD BEEN DIVERTED BY A LITTLE CARRIAGE
DRAWN BY A LARGE DOG WHICH HAD JUST PASSED SUDDENLY PERCEIVED THAT HIS
THREE CONDUCTRESSES WERE GAZING AT SOMETHING THROUGH THE WINDOW AND
CURIOSITY TAKING POSSESSION OF HIM IN HIS TURN HE CLIMBED UPON A STONE
POST ELEVATED HIMSELF ON TIPTOE AND APPLIED HIS FAT RED FACE TO THE
OPENING SHOUTING MOTHER LET ME SEE TOO
AT THE SOUND OF THIS CLEAR FRESH RINGING CHILD'S VOICE THE RECLUSE
TREMBLED SHE TURNED HER HEAD WITH THE SHARP ABRUPT MOVEMENT OF A STEEL
SPRING HER LONG FLESHLESS HANDS CAST ASIDE THE HAIR FROM HER BROW
AND SHE FIXED UPON THE CHILD BITTER ASTONISHED DESPERATE EYES
THIS
GLANCE WAS BUT A LIGHTNING FLASH
OH MY GOD SHE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED HIDING HER HEAD ON HER KNEES AND
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HER HOARSE VOICE TORE HER CHEST AS IT PASSED FROM
IT DO NOT SHOW ME THOSE OF OTHERS
GOOD DAY MADAM SAID THE CHILD GRAVELY
NEVERTHELESS THIS SHOCK HAD SO TO SPEAK AWAKENED THE RECLUSE
A LONG
SHIVER TRAVERSED HER FRAME FROM HEAD TO FOOT HER TEETH CHATTERED SHE
HALF RAISED HER HEAD AND SAID PRESSING HER ELBOWS AGAINST HER HIPS AND
CLASPING HER FEET IN HER HANDS AS THOUGH TO WARM THEM
OH HOW COLD IT IS
POOR WOMAN SAID OUDARDE WITH GREAT COMPASSION WOULD YOU LIKE A
LITTLE FIRE
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD IN TOKEN OF REFUSAL
WELL RESUMED OUDARDE PRESENTING HER WITH A FLAGON HERE IS SOME
HIPPOCRAS WHICH WILL WARM YOU DRINK IT
AGAIN SHE SHOOK HER HEAD LOOKED AT OUDARDE FIXEDLY AND REPLIED
WATER
OUDARDE PERSISTED NO SISTER THAT IS NO BEVERAGE FOR JANUARY
YOU
MUST DRINK A LITTLE HIPPOCRAS AND EAT THIS LEAVENED CAKE OF MAIZE WHICH
WE HAVE BAKED FOR YOU
SHE REFUSED THE CAKE WHICH MAHIETTE OFFERED TO HER AND SAID BLACK
BREAD
COME SAID GERVAISE SEIZED IN HER TURN WITH AN IMPULSE OF CHARITY
AND UNFASTENING HER WOOLEN CLOAK HERE IS A CLOAK WHICH IS A LITTLE
WARMER THAN YOURS
SHE REFUSED THE CLOAK AS SHE HAD REFUSED THE FLAGON AND THE CAKE AND
REPLIED A SACK
BUT RESUMED THE GOOD OUDARDE YOU MUST HAVE PERCEIVED TO SOME
EXTENT THAT YESTERDAY WAS A FESTIVAL
I DO PERCEIVE IT SAID THE RECLUSE 'TIS TWO DAYS NOW SINCE I HAVE
HAD ANY WATER IN MY CROCK
SHE ADDED AFTER A SILENCE 'TIS A FESTIVAL I AM FORGOTTEN
PEOPLE DO
WELL
WHY SHOULD THE WORLD THINK OF ME WHEN I DO NOT THINK OF IT COLD
CHARCOAL MAKES COLD ASHES
AND AS THOUGH FATIGUED WITH HAVING SAID SO MUCH SHE DROPPED HER HEAD ON
HER KNEES AGAIN
THE SIMPLE AND CHARITABLE OUDARDE WHO FANCIED THAT
SHE UNDERSTOOD FROM HER LAST WORDS THAT SHE WAS COMPLAINING OF THE COLD
REPLIED INNOCENTLY THEN YOU WOULD LIKE A LITTLE FIRE
FIRE SAID THE SACKED NUN WITH A STRANGE ACCENT AND WILL YOU ALSO
MAKE A LITTLE FOR THE POOR LITTLE ONE WHO HAS BEEN BENEATH THE SOD FOR
THESE FIFTEEN YEARS
EVERY LIMB WAS TREMBLING HER VOICE QUIVERED HER EYES FLASHED SHE HAD
RAISED HERSELF UPON HER KNEES SUDDENLY SHE EXTENDED HER THIN
WHITE HAND TOWARDS THE CHILD WHO WAS REGARDING HER WITH A LOOK OF
ASTONISHMENT
TAKE AWAY THAT CHILD SHE CRIED
THE EGYPTIAN WOMAN IS
ABOUT TO PASS BY
THEN SHE FELL FACE DOWNWARD ON THE EARTH AND HER FOREHEAD STRUCK THE
STONE WITH THE SOUND OF ONE STONE AGAINST ANOTHER STONE
THE THREE
WOMEN THOUGHT HER DEAD
A MOMENT LATER HOWEVER SHE MOVED AND THEY
BEHELD HER DRAG HERSELF ON HER KNEES AND ELBOWS TO THE CORNER WHERE
THE LITTLE SHOE WAS
THEN THEY DARED NOT LOOK THEY NO LONGER SAW HER
BUT THEY HEARD A THOUSAND KISSES AND A THOUSAND SIGHS MINGLED WITH
HEARTRENDING CRIES AND DULL BLOWS LIKE THOSE OF A HEAD IN CONTACT WITH
A WALL
THEN AFTER ONE OF THESE BLOWS SO VIOLENT THAT ALL THREE OF
THEM STAGGERED THEY HEARD NO MORE
CAN SHE HAVE KILLED HERSELF SAID GERVAISE VENTURING TO PASS HER HEAD
THROUGH THE AIR HOLE
SISTER SISTER GUDULE
SISTER GUDULE REPEATED OUDARDE
AH GOOD HEAVENS SHE NO LONGER MOVES RESUMED GERVAISE IS SHE DEAD
GUDULE GUDULE
MAHIETTE CHOKED TO SUCH A POINT THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK MADE AN
EFFORT
WAIT SAID SHE
THEN BENDING TOWARDS THE WINDOW PAQUETTE
SHE SAID PAQUETTE LE CHANTEFLEURIE
A CHILD WHO INNOCENTLY BLOWS UPON THE BADLY IGNITED FUSE OF A BOMB AND
MAKES IT EXPLODE IN HIS FACE IS NO MORE TERRIFIED THAN WAS MAHIETTE
AT THE EFFECT OF THAT NAME ABRUPTLY LAUNCHED INTO THE CELL OF SISTER
GUDULE
THE RECLUSE TREMBLED ALL OVER ROSE ERECT ON HER BARE FEET AND LEAPED
AT THE WINDOW WITH EYES SO GLARING THAT MAHIETTE AND OUDARDE AND THE
OTHER WOMAN AND THE CHILD RECOILED EVEN TO THE PARAPET OF THE QUAY
MEANWHILE THE SINISTER FACE OF THE RECLUSE APPEARED PRESSED TO THE
GRATING OF THE AIR HOLE
OH OH SHE CRIED WITH AN APPALLING LAUGH
'TIS THE EGYPTIAN WHO IS CALLING ME
AT THAT MOMENT A SCENE WHICH WAS PASSING AT THE PILLORY CAUGHT HER WILD
EYE
HER BROW CONTRACTED WITH HORROR SHE STRETCHED HER TWO SKELETON
ARMS FROM HER CELL AND SHRIEKED IN A VOICE WHICH RESEMBLED A
DEATH RATTLE SO 'TIS THOU ONCE MORE DAUGHTER OF EGYPT 'TIS THOU
WHO CALLEST ME STEALER OF CHILDREN WELL BE THOU ACCURSED ACCURSED
ACCURSED ACCURSED
CHAPTER IV
A TEAR FOR A DROP OF WATER
THESE WORDS WERE SO TO SPEAK THE POINT OF UNION OF TWO SCENES WHICH
HAD UP TO THAT TIME BEEN DEVELOPED IN PARALLEL LINES AT THE SAME
MOMENT EACH ON ITS PARTICULAR THEATRE ONE THAT WHICH THE READER HAS
JUST PERUSED IN THE RAT HOLE THE OTHER WHICH HE IS ABOUT TO READ ON
THE LADDER OF THE PILLORY
THE FIRST HAD FOR WITNESSES ONLY THE THREE
WOMEN WITH WHOM THE READER HAS JUST MADE ACQUAINTANCE THE SECOND HAD
FOR SPECTATORS ALL THE PUBLIC WHICH WE HAVE SEEN ABOVE COLLECTING ON
THE PLACE DE GRVE AROUND THE PILLORY AND THE GIBBET
THAT CROWD WHICH THE FOUR SERGEANTS POSTED AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE
MORNING AT THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE PILLORY HAD INSPIRED WITH THE HOPE
OF SOME SORT OF AN EXECUTION NO DOUBT NOT A HANGING BUT A WHIPPING
A CROPPING OF EARS SOMETHING IN SHORT THAT CROWD HAD INCREASED SO
RAPIDLY THAT THE FOUR POLICEMEN TOO CLOSELY BESIEGED HAD HAD OCCASION
TO PRESS IT AS THE EXPRESSION THEN RAN MORE THAN ONCE BY SOUND
BLOWS OF THEIR WHIPS AND THE HAUNCHES OF THEIR HORSES
THIS POPULACE DISCIPLINED TO WAITING FOR PUBLIC EXECUTIONS DID NOT
MANIFEST VERY MUCH IMPATIENCE
IT AMUSED ITSELF WITH WATCHING THE
PILLORY A VERY SIMPLE SORT OF MONUMENT COMPOSED OF A CUBE OF MASONRY
ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH AND HOLLOW IN THE INTERIOR
A VERY STEEP STAIRCASE
OF UNHEWN STONE WHICH WAS CALLED BY DISTINCTION THE LADDER LED TO
THE UPPER PLATFORM UPON WHICH WAS VISIBLE A HORIZONTAL WHEEL OF SOLID
OAK
THE VICTIM WAS BOUND UPON THIS WHEEL ON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HANDS
BEHIND HIS BACK
A WOODEN SHAFT WHICH SET IN MOTION A CAPSTAN CONCEALED
IN THE INTERIOR OF THE LITTLE EDIFICE IMPARTED A ROTATORY MOTION TO
THE WHEEL WHICH ALWAYS MAINTAINED ITS HORIZONTAL POSITION AND IN THIS
MANNER PRESENTED THE FACE OF THE CONDEMNED MAN TO ALL QUARTERS OF THE
SQUARE IN SUCCESSION
THIS WAS WHAT WAS CALLED TURNING A CRIMINAL
AS THE READER PERCEIVES THE PILLORY OF THE GRVE WAS FAR FROM
PRESENTING ALL THE RECREATIONS OF THE PILLORY OF THE HALLES
NOTHING
ARCHITECTURAL NOTHING MONUMENTAL
NO ROOF TO THE IRON CROSS NO
OCTAGONAL LANTERN NO FRAIL SLENDER COLUMNS SPREADING OUT ON THE EDGE
OF THE ROOF INTO CAPITALS OF ACANTHUS LEAVES AND FLOWERS NO WATERSPOUTS
OF CHIMERAS AND MONSTERS ON CARVED WOODWORK NO FINE SCULPTURE DEEPLY
SUNK IN THE STONE
THEY WERE FORCED TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THOSE FOUR STRETCHES OF
RUBBLE WORK BACKED WITH SANDSTONE AND A WRETCHED STONE GIBBET MEAGRE
AND BARE ON ONE SIDE
THE ENTERTAINMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT A POOR ONE FOR LOVERS OF GOTHIC
ARCHITECTURE
IT IS TRUE THAT NOTHING WAS EVER LESS CURIOUS ON THE SCORE
OF ARCHITECTURE THAN THE WORTHY GAPERS OF THE MIDDLE AGES AND THAT THEY
CARED VERY LITTLE FOR THE BEAUTY OF A PILLORY
THE VICTIM FINALLY ARRIVED BOUND TO THE TAIL OF A CART AND WHEN HE HAD
BEEN HOISTED UPON THE PLATFORM WHERE HE COULD BE SEEN FROM ALL POINTS
OF THE PLACE BOUND WITH CORDS AND STRAPS UPON THE WHEEL OF THE PILLORY
A PRODIGIOUS HOOT MINGLED WITH LAUGHTER AND ACCLAMATIONS BURST FORTH
UPON THE PLACE
THEY HAD RECOGNIZED QUASIMODO
IT WAS HE IN FACT
THE CHANGE WAS SINGULAR
PILLORIED ON THE VERY PLACE
WHERE ON THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN SALUTED ACCLAIMED AND PROCLAIMED
POPE AND PRINCE OF FOOLS IN THE CORTEGE OF THE DUKE OF EGYPT THE KING
OF THUNES AND THE EMPEROR OF GALILEE ONE THING IS CERTAIN AND THAT
IS THAT THERE WAS NOT A SOUL IN THE CROWD NOT EVEN HIMSELF THOUGH IN
TURN TRIUMPHANT AND THE SUFFERER WHO SET FORTH THIS COMBINATION CLEARLY
IN HIS THOUGHT
GRINGOIRE AND HIS PHILOSOPHY WERE MISSING AT THIS
SPECTACLE
SOON MICHEL NOIRET SWORN TRUMPETER TO THE KING OUR LORD IMPOSED
SILENCE ON THE LOUTS AND PROCLAIMED THE SENTENCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE ORDER AND COMMAND OF MONSIEUR THE PROVOST
THEN HE WITHDREW BEHIND
THE CART WITH HIS MEN IN LIVERY SURCOATS
QUASIMODO IMPASSIBLE DID NOT WINCE
ALL RESISTANCE HAD BEEN RENDERED
IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM BY WHAT WAS THEN CALLED IN THE STYLE OF THE CRIMINAL
CHANCELLERY THE VEHEMENCE AND FIRMNESS OF THE BONDS WHICH MEANS THAT
THE THONGS AND CHAINS PROBABLY CUT INTO HIS FLESH MOREOVER IT IS A
TRADITION OF JAIL AND WARDENS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN LOST AND WHICH THE
HANDCUFFS STILL PRECIOUSLY PRESERVE AMONG US A CIVILIZED GENTLE
HUMANE PEOPLE THE GALLEYS AND THE GUILLOTINE IN PARENTHESES
HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE LED PUSHED CARRIED LIFTED BOUND
AND BOUND AGAIN
NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN UPON HIS COUNTENANCE BUT THE
ASTONISHMENT OF A SAVAGE OR AN IDIOT
HE WAS KNOWN TO BE DEAF ONE MIGHT
HAVE PRONOUNCED HIM TO BE BLIND
THEY PLACED HIM ON HIS KNEES ON THE CIRCULAR PLANK HE MADE NO
RESISTANCE
THEY REMOVED HIS SHIRT AND DOUBLET AS FAR AS HIS GIRDLE HE
ALLOWED THEM TO HAVE THEIR WAY
THEY ENTANGLED HIM UNDER A FRESH SYSTEM
OF THONGS AND BUCKLES HE ALLOWED THEM TO BIND AND BUCKLE HIM
ONLY FROM
TIME TO TIME HE SNORTED NOISILY LIKE A CALF WHOSE HEAD IS HANGING AND
BUMPING OVER THE EDGE OF A BUTCHER'S CART
THE DOLT SAID JEHAN FROLLO OF THE MILL TO HIS FRIEND ROBIN
POUSSEPAIN FOR THE TWO STUDENTS HAD FOLLOWED THE CULPRIT AS WAS TO
HAVE BEEN EXPECTED HE UNDERSTANDS NO MORE THAN A COCKCHAFER SHUT UP
IN A BOX
THERE WAS WILD LAUGHTER AMONG THE CROWD WHEN THEY BEHELD QUASIMODO'S
HUMP HIS CAMEL'S BREAST HIS CALLOUS AND HAIRY SHOULDERS LAID BARE
DURING THIS GAYETY A MAN IN THE LIVERY OF THE CITY SHORT OF STATURE
AND ROBUST OF MIEN MOUNTED THE PLATFORM AND PLACED HIMSELF NEAR THE
VICTIM
HIS NAME SPEEDILY CIRCULATED AMONG THE SPECTATORS
IT WAS MASTER
PIERRAT TORTERUE OFFICIAL TORTURER TO THE CHTELET
HE BEGAN BY DEPOSITING ON AN ANGLE OF THE PILLORY A BLACK HOUR GLASS
THE UPPER LOBE OF WHICH WAS FILLED WITH RED SAND WHICH IT ALLOWED
TO GLIDE INTO THE LOWER RECEPTACLE THEN HE REMOVED HIS PARTI COLORED
SURTOUT AND THERE BECAME VISIBLE SUSPENDED FROM HIS RIGHT HAND A
THIN AND TAPERING WHIP OF LONG WHITE SHINING KNOTTED PLAITED THONGS
ARMED WITH METAL NAILS
WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE NEGLIGENTLY FOLDED BACK
HIS SHIRT AROUND HIS RIGHT ARM TO THE VERY ARMPIT
IN THE MEANTIME JEHAN FROLLO ELEVATING HIS CURLY BLONDE HEAD ABOVE
THE CROWD HE HAD MOUNTED UPON THE SHOULDERS OF ROBIN POUSSEPAIN FOR THE
PURPOSE SHOUTED COME AND LOOK GENTLE LADIES AND MEN THEY ARE
GOING TO PEREMPTORILY FLAGELLATE MASTER QUASIMODO THE BELLRINGER OF
MY BROTHER MONSIEUR THE ARCHDEACON OF JOSAS A KNAVE OF ORIENTAL
ARCHITECTURE WHO HAS A BACK LIKE A DOME AND LEGS LIKE TWISTED
COLUMNS
AND THE CROWD BURST INTO A LAUGH ESPECIALLY THE BOYS AND YOUNG GIRLS
AT LENGTH THE TORTURER STAMPED HIS FOOT
THE WHEEL BEGAN TO TURN
QUASIMODO WAVERED BENEATH HIS BONDS
THE AMAZEMENT WHICH WAS SUDDENLY
DEPICTED UPON HIS DEFORMED FACE CAUSED THE BURSTS OF LAUGHTER TO
REDOUBLE AROUND HIM
ALL AT ONCE AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE WHEEL IN ITS REVOLUTION PRESENTED TO
MASTER PIERRAT THE HUMPED BACK OF QUASIMODO MASTER PIERRAT RAISED HIS
ARM THE FINE THONGS WHISTLED SHARPLY THROUGH THE AIR LIKE A HANDFUL OF
ADDERS AND FELL WITH FURY UPON THE WRETCH'S SHOULDERS
QUASIMODO LEAPED AS THOUGH AWAKENED WITH A START
HE BEGAN TO
UNDERSTAND
HE WRITHED IN HIS BONDS A VIOLENT CONTRACTION OF SURPRISE
AND PAIN DISTORTED THE MUSCLES OF HIS FACE BUT HE UTTERED NOT A SINGLE
SIGH
HE MERELY TURNED HIS HEAD BACKWARD TO THE RIGHT THEN TO THE
LEFT BALANCING IT AS A BULL DOES WHO HAS BEEN STUNG IN THE FLANKS BY A
GADFLY
A SECOND BLOW FOLLOWED THE FIRST THEN A THIRD AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER
AND STILL OTHERS
THE WHEEL DID NOT CEASE TO TURN NOR THE BLOWS TO RAIN
DOWN
SOON THE BLOOD BURST FORTH AND COULD BE SEEN TRICKLING IN A THOUSAND
THREADS DOWN THE HUNCHBACK'S BLACK SHOULDERS AND THE SLENDER THONGS IN
THEIR ROTATORY MOTION WHICH RENT THE AIR SPRINKLED DROPS OF IT UPON THE
CROWD
QUASIMODO HAD RESUMED TO ALL APPEARANCE HIS FIRST IMPERTURBABILITY
HE
HAD AT FIRST TRIED IN A QUIET WAY AND WITHOUT MUCH OUTWARD MOVEMENT
TO BREAK HIS BONDS
HIS EYE HAD BEEN SEEN TO LIGHT UP HIS MUSCLES
TO STIFFEN HIS MEMBERS TO CONCENTRATE THEIR FORCE AND THE STRAPS
TO STRETCH
THE EFFORT WAS POWERFUL PRODIGIOUS DESPERATE BUT THE
PROVOST'S SEASONED BONDS RESISTED
THEY CRACKED AND THAT WAS ALL
QUASIMODO FELL BACK EXHAUSTED
AMAZEMENT GAVE WAY ON HIS FEATURES TO
A SENTIMENT OF PROFOUND AND BITTER DISCOURAGEMENT
HE CLOSED HIS SINGLE
EYE ALLOWED HIS HEAD TO DROOP UPON HIS BREAST AND FEIGNED DEATH
FROM THAT MOMENT FORTH HE STIRRED NO MORE
NOTHING COULD FORCE A
MOVEMENT FROM HIM
NEITHER HIS BLOOD WHICH DID NOT CEASE TO FLOW NOR
THE BLOWS WHICH REDOUBLED IN FURY NOR THE WRATH OF THE TORTURER WHO
GREW EXCITED HIMSELF AND INTOXICATED WITH THE EXECUTION NOR THE SOUND
OF THE HORRIBLE THONGS MORE SHARP AND WHISTLING THAN THE CLAWS OF
SCORPIONS
AT LENGTH A BAILIFF FROM THE CHTELET CLAD IN BLACK MOUNTED ON A BLACK
HORSE WHO HAD BEEN STATIONED BESIDE THE LADDER SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THE EXECUTION EXTENDED HIS EBONY WAND TOWARDS THE HOUR GLASS
THE
TORTURER STOPPED
THE WHEEL STOPPED
QUASIMODO'S EYE OPENED SLOWLY
THE SCOURGING WAS FINISHED
TWO LACKEYS OF THE OFFICIAL TORTURER BATHED
THE BLEEDING SHOULDERS OF THE PATIENT ANOINTED THEM WITH SOME UNGUENT
WHICH IMMEDIATELY CLOSED ALL THE WOUNDS AND THREW UPON HIS BACK A SORT
OF YELLOW VESTMENT IN CUT LIKE A CHASUBLE
IN THE MEANWHILE PIERRAT
TORTERUE ALLOWED THE THONGS RED AND GORGED WITH BLOOD TO DRIP UPON THE
PAVEMENT
ALL WAS NOT OVER FOR QUASIMODO
HE HAD STILL TO UNDERGO THAT HOUR OF
PILLORY WHICH MASTER FLORIAN BARBEDIENNE HAD SO JUDICIOUSLY ADDED TO THE
SENTENCE OF MESSIRE ROBERT D'ESTOUTEVILLE ALL TO THE GREATER GLORY
OF THE OLD PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PLAY UPON WORDS OF JEAN DE
CUMNE SURDUS ABSURDUS A DEAF MAN IS ABSURD
SO THE HOUR GLASS WAS TURNED OVER ONCE MORE AND THEY LEFT THE HUNCHBACK
FASTENED TO THE PLANK IN ORDER THAT JUSTICE MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED TO
THE VERY END
THE POPULACE ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDDLE AGES IS IN SOCIETY WHAT THE
CHILD IS IN THE FAMILY
AS LONG AS IT REMAINS IN ITS STATE OF PRIMITIVE
IGNORANCE OF MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL MINORITY IT CAN BE SAID OF IT AS
OF THE CHILD
'TIS THE PITILESS AGE
WE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THAT QUASIMODO WAS GENERALLY HATED FOR MORE THAN
ONE GOOD REASON IT IS TRUE
THERE WAS HARDLY A SPECTATOR IN THAT CROWD
WHO HAD NOT OR WHO DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE
MALEVOLENT HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME
THE JOY AT SEEING HIM APPEAR THUS
IN THE PILLORY HAD BEEN UNIVERSAL AND THE HARSH PUNISHMENT WHICH HE HAD
JUST SUFFERED AND THE PITIFUL CONDITION IN WHICH IT HAD LEFT HIM FAR
FROM SOFTENING THE POPULACE HAD RENDERED ITS HATRED MORE MALICIOUS BY
ARMING IT WITH A TOUCH OF MIRTH
HENCE THE PUBLIC PROSECUTION SATISFIED AS THE BIGWIGS OF THE LAW
STILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR JARGON THE TURN CAME OF A THOUSAND PRIVATE
VENGEANCES
HERE AS IN THE GRAND HALL THE WOMEN RENDERED THEMSELVES
PARTICULARLY PROMINENT
ALL CHERISHED SOME RANCOR AGAINST HIM SOME FOR
HIS MALICE OTHERS FOR HIS UGLINESS
THE LATTER WERE THE MOST FURIOUS
OH MASK OF ANTICHRIST SAID ONE
RIDER ON A BROOM HANDLE CRIED ANOTHER
WHAT A FINE TRAGIC GRIMACE HOWLED A THIRD AND WHO WOULD MAKE HIM
POPE OF THE FOOLS IF TO DAY WERE YESTERDAY
'TIS WELL STRUCK IN AN OLD WOMAN
THIS IS THE GRIMACE OF THE
PILLORY
WHEN SHALL WE HAVE THAT OF THE GIBBET
WHEN WILL YOU BE COIFFED WITH YOUR BIG BELL A HUNDRED FEET UNDER
GROUND CURSED BELLRINGER
BUT 'TIS THE DEVIL WHO RINGS THE ANGELUS
OH THE DEAF MAN THE ONE EYED CREATURE THE HUNCH BACK THE MONSTER
A FACE TO MAKE A WOMAN MISCARRY BETTER THAN ALL THE DRUGS AND
MEDICINES
AND THE TWO SCHOLARS JEHAN DU MOULIN AND ROBIN POUSSEPAIN SANG AT THE
TOP OF THEIR LUNGS THE ANCIENT REFRAIN
UNE HART
POUR LE PENDARD
UN FAGOT
POUR LE MAGOT
A ROPE FOR THE GALLOWS BIRD A FAGOT FOR THE APE
A THOUSAND OTHER INSULTS RAINED DOWN UPON HIM AND HOOTS AND
IMPRECATIONS AND LAUGHTER AND NOW AND THEN STONES
QUASIMODO WAS DEAF BUT HIS SIGHT WAS CLEAR AND THE PUBLIC FURY WAS
NO LESS ENERGETICALLY DEPICTED ON THEIR VISAGES THAN IN THEIR WORDS
MOREOVER THE BLOWS FROM THE STONES EXPLAINED THE BURSTS OF LAUGHTER
AT FIRST HE HELD HIS GROUND
BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE THAT PATIENCE WHICH
HAD BORNE UP UNDER THE LASH OF THE TORTURER YIELDED AND GAVE WAY BEFORE
ALL THESE STINGS OF INSECTS
THE BULL OF THE ASTURIAS WHO HAS BEEN BUT
LITTLE MOVED BY THE ATTACKS OF THE PICADOR GROWS IRRITATED WITH THE DOGS
AND BANDERILLERAS
HE FIRST CAST AROUND A SLOW GLANCE OF HATRED UPON THE CROWD
BUT BOUND
AS HE WAS HIS GLANCE WAS POWERLESS TO DRIVE AWAY THOSE FLIES WHICH
WERE STINGING HIS WOUND
THEN HE MOVED IN HIS BONDS AND HIS FURIOUS
EXERTIONS MADE THE ANCIENT WHEEL OF THE PILLORY SHRIEK ON ITS AXLE
ALL
THIS ONLY INCREASED THE DERISION AND HOOTING
THEN THE WRETCHED MAN UNABLE TO BREAK HIS COLLAR LIKE THAT OF A
CHAINED WILD BEAST BECAME TRANQUIL ONCE MORE ONLY AT INTERVALS A SIGH
OF RAGE HEAVED THE HOLLOWS OF HIS CHEST
THERE WAS NEITHER SHAME NOR
REDNESS ON HIS FACE
HE WAS TOO FAR FROM THE STATE OF SOCIETY AND TOO
NEAR THE STATE OF NATURE TO KNOW WHAT SHAME WAS
MOREOVER WITH SUCH
A DEGREE OF DEFORMITY IS INFAMY A THING THAT CAN BE FELT BUT WRATH
HATRED DESPAIR SLOWLY LOWERED OVER THAT HIDEOUS VISAGE A CLOUD
WHICH GREW EVER MORE AND MORE SOMBRE EVER MORE AND MORE CHARGED WITH
ELECTRICITY WHICH BURST FORTH IN A THOUSAND LIGHTNING FLASHES FROM THE
EYE OF THE CYCLOPS
NEVERTHELESS THAT CLOUD CLEARED AWAY FOR A MOMENT AT THE PASSAGE OF
A MULE WHICH TRAVERSED THE CROWD BEARING A PRIEST
AS FAR AWAY AS
HE COULD SEE THAT MULE AND THAT PRIEST THE POOR VICTIM'S VISAGE GREW
GENTLER
THE FURY WHICH HAD CONTRACTED IT WAS FOLLOWED BY A STRANGE
SMILE FULL OF INEFFABLE SWEETNESS GENTLENESS AND TENDERNESS
IN
PROPORTION AS THE PRIEST APPROACHED THAT SMILE BECAME MORE CLEAR MORE
DISTINCT MORE RADIANT
IT WAS LIKE THE ARRIVAL OF A SAVIOUR WHICH THE
UNHAPPY MAN WAS GREETING
BUT AS SOON AS THE MULE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO THE
PILLORY TO ALLOW OF ITS RIDER RECOGNIZING THE VICTIM THE PRIEST DROPPED
HIS EYES BEAT A HASTY RETREAT SPURRED ON RIGOROUSLY AS THOUGH IN
HASTE TO RID HIMSELF OF HUMILIATING APPEALS AND NOT AT ALL DESIROUS OF
BEING SALUTED AND RECOGNIZED BY A POOR FELLOW IN SUCH A PREDICAMENT
THIS PRIEST WAS ARCHDEACON DOM CLAUDE FROLLO
THE CLOUD DESCENDED MORE BLACKLY THAN EVER UPON QUASIMODO'S BROW
THE
SMILE WAS STILL MINGLED WITH IT FOR A TIME BUT WAS BITTER DISCOURAGED
PROFOUNDLY SAD
TIME PASSED ON
HE HAD BEEN THERE AT LEAST AN HOUR AND A HALF
LACERATED MALTREATED MOCKED INCESSANTLY AND ALMOST STONED
ALL AT ONCE HE MOVED AGAIN IN HIS CHAINS WITH REDOUBLED DESPAIR WHICH
MADE THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK THAT BORE HIM TREMBLE AND BREAKING THE
SILENCE WHICH HE HAD OBSTINATELY PRESERVED HITHERTO HE CRIED IN A
HOARSE AND FURIOUS VOICE WHICH RESEMBLED A BARK RATHER THAN A HUMAN
CRY AND WHICH WAS DROWNED IN THE NOISE OF THE HOOTS DRINK
THIS EXCLAMATION OF DISTRESS FAR FROM EXCITING COMPASSION ONLY ADDED
AMUSEMENT TO THE GOOD PARISIAN POPULACE WHO SURROUNDED THE LADDER AND
WHO IT MUST BE CONFESSED TAKEN IN THE MASS AND AS A MULTITUDE WAS
THEN NO LESS CRUEL AND BRUTAL THAN THAT HORRIBLE TRIBE OF ROBBERS AMONG
WHOM WE HAVE ALREADY CONDUCTED THE READER AND WHICH WAS SIMPLY THE
LOWER STRATUM OF THE POPULACE
NOT A VOICE WAS RAISED AROUND THE UNHAPPY
VICTIM EXCEPT TO JEER AT HIS THIRST
IT IS CERTAIN THAT AT THAT MOMENT
HE WAS MORE GROTESQUE AND REPULSIVE THAN PITIABLE WITH HIS FACE PURPLE
AND DRIPPING HIS EYE WILD HIS MOUTH FOAMING WITH RAGE AND PAIN AND
HIS TONGUE LOLLING HALF OUT
IT MUST ALSO BE STATED THAT IF A CHARITABLE
SOUL OF A BOURGEOIS OR BOURGEOISE IN THE RABBLE HAD ATTEMPTED TO
CARRY A GLASS OF WATER TO THAT WRETCHED CREATURE IN TORMENT THERE
REIGNED AROUND THE INFAMOUS STEPS OF THE PILLORY SUCH A PREJUDICE OF
SHAME AND IGNOMINY THAT IT WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO REPULSE THE GOOD
SAMARITAN
AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MOMENTS QUASIMODO CAST A DESPERATE GLANCE
UPON THE CROWD AND REPEATED IN A VOICE STILL MORE HEARTRENDING
DRINK
AND ALL BEGAN TO LAUGH
DRINK THIS CRIED ROBIN POUSSEPAIN THROWING IN HIS FACE A SPONGE
WHICH HAD BEEN SOAKED IN THE GUTTER
THERE YOU DEAF VILLAIN I'M YOUR
DEBTOR
A WOMAN HURLED A STONE AT HIS HEAD
THAT WILL TEACH YOU TO WAKE US UP AT NIGHT WITH YOUR PEAL OF A DAMMED
SOUL
HE GOOD MY SON HOWLED A CRIPPLE MAKING AN EFFORT TO REACH HIM WITH
HIS CRUTCH WILL YOU CAST ANY MORE SPELLS ON US FROM THE TOP OF THE
TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME
HERE'S A DRINKING CUP CHIMED IN A MAN FLINGING A BROKEN JUG AT HIS
BREAST
'TWAS YOU THAT MADE MY WIFE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE PASSED NEAR
YOU GIVE BIRTH TO A CHILD WITH TWO HEADS
AND MY CAT BRING FORTH A KITTEN WITH SIX PAWS YELPED AN OLD CRONE
LAUNCHING A BRICK AT HIM
DRINK REPEATED QUASIMODO PANTING AND FOR THE THIRD TIME
AT THAT MOMENT HE BEHELD THE CROWD GIVE WAY
A YOUNG GIRL FANTASTICALLY
DRESSED EMERGED FROM THE THRONG
SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A LITTLE WHITE
GOAT WITH GILDED HORNS AND CARRIED A TAMBOURINE IN HER HAND
QUASIMODO'S EYES SPARKLED
IT WAS THE GYPSY WHOM HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO
CARRY OFF ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT A MISDEED FOR WHICH HE WAS DIMLY
CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS BEING PUNISHED AT THAT VERY MOMENT WHICH WAS
NOT IN THE LEAST THE CASE SINCE HE WAS BEING CHASTISED ONLY FOR THE
MISFORTUNE OF BEING DEAF AND OF HAVING BEEN JUDGED BY A DEAF MAN
HE
DOUBTED NOT THAT SHE HAD COME TO WREAK HER VENGEANCE ALSO AND TO DEAL
HER BLOW LIKE THE REST
HE BEHELD HER IN FACT MOUNT THE LADDER RAPIDLY
WRATH AND SPITE
SUFFOCATE HIM
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO MAKE THE PILLORY CRUMBLE INTO
RUINS AND IF THE LIGHTNING OF HIS EYE COULD HAVE DEALT DEATH THE GYPSY
WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO POWDER BEFORE SHE REACHED THE PLATFORM
SHE APPROACHED WITHOUT UTTERING A SYLLABLE THE VICTIM WHO WRITHED IN
A VAIN EFFORT TO ESCAPE HER AND DETACHING A GOURD FROM HER GIRDLE SHE
RAISED IT GENTLY TO THE PARCHED LIPS OF THE MISERABLE MAN
THEN FROM THAT EYE WHICH HAD BEEN UP TO THAT MOMENT SO DRY AND
BURNING A BIG TEAR WAS SEEN TO FALL AND ROLL SLOWLY DOWN THAT DEFORMED
VISAGE SO LONG CONTRACTED WITH DESPAIR
IT WAS THE FIRST IN ALL
PROBABILITY THAT THE UNFORTUNATE MAN HAD EVER SHED
MEANWHILE HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO DRINK
THE GYPSY MADE HER LITTLE POUT
FROM IMPATIENCE AND PRESSED THE SPOUT TO THE TUSKED MONTH OF QUASIMODO
WITH A SMILE
HE DRANK WITH DEEP DRAUGHTS
HIS THIRST WAS BURNING
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THE WRETCH PROTRUDED HIS BLACK LIPS NO DOUBT
WITH THE OBJECT OF KISSING THE BEAUTIFUL HAND WHICH HAD JUST SUCCOURED
HIM
BUT THE YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS PERHAPS SOMEWHAT DISTRUSTFUL AND WHO
REMEMBERED THE VIOLENT ATTEMPT OF THE NIGHT WITHDREW HER HAND WITH THE
FRIGHTENED GESTURE OF A CHILD WHO IS AFRAID OF BEING BITTEN BY A BEAST
THEN THE POOR DEAF MAN FIXED ON HER A LOOK FULL OF REPROACH AND
INEXPRESSIBLE SADNESS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TOUCHING SPECTACLE ANYWHERE THIS BEAUTIFUL
FRESH PURE AND CHARMING GIRL WHO WAS AT THE SAME TIME SO WEAK THUS
HASTENING TO THE RELIEF OF SO MUCH MISERY DEFORMITY AND MALEVOLENCE
ON THE PILLORY THE SPECTACLE WAS SUBLIME
THE VERY POPULACE WERE CAPTIVATED BY IT AND BEGAN TO CLAP THEIR HANDS
CRYING
NOEL NOEL
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT THE RECLUSE CAUGHT SIGHT FROM THE WINDOW OF
HER BOLE OF THE GYPSY ON THE PILLORY AND HURLED AT HER HER SINISTER
IMPRECATION
ACCURSED BE THOU DAUGHTER OF EGYPT ACCURSED ACCURSED
CHAPTER V
END OF THE STORY OF THE CAKE
LA ESMERALDA TURNED PALE AND DESCENDED FROM THE PILLORY STAGGERING AS
SHE WENT
THE VOICE OF THE RECLUSE STILL PURSUED HER
DESCEND DESCEND THIEF OF EGYPT THOU SHALT ASCEND IT ONCE MORE
THE SACKED NUN IS IN ONE OF HER TANTRUMS MUTTERED THE POPULACE
AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT
FOR THAT SORT OF WOMAN WAS FEARED WHICH
RENDERED THEM SACRED
PEOPLE DID NOT THEN WILLINGLY ATTACK ONE WHO
PRAYED DAY AND NIGHT
THE HOUR HAD ARRIVED FOR REMOVING QUASIMODO
HE WAS UNBOUND THE CROWD
DISPERSED
NEAR THE GRAND PONT MAHIETTE WHO WAS RETURNING WITH HER TWO
COMPANIONS SUDDENLY HALTED
BY THE WAY EUSTACHE WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THAT CAKE
MOTHER SAID THE CHILD WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WITH THAT LADY IN THE
BOLE A BIG DOG TOOK A BITE OF MY CAKE AND THEN I BIT IT ALSO
WHAT SIR DID YOU EAT THE WHOLE OF IT SHE WENT ON
MOTHER IT WAS THE DOG
I TOLD HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ME
THEN
I BIT INTO IT ALSO
'TIS A TERRIBLE CHILD SAID THE MOTHER SMILING AND SCOLDING AT ONE
AND THE SAME TIME
DO YOU SEE OUDARDE HE ALREADY EATS ALL THE FRUIT
FROM THE CHERRY TREE IN OUR ORCHARD OF CHARLERANGE
SO HIS GRANDFATHER
SAYS THAT HE WILL BE A CAPTAIN
JUST LET ME CATCH YOU AT IT AGAIN

CHAPTER I
THE DANGER OF CONFIDING ONE'S SECRET TO A GOAT
MANY WEEKS HAD ELAPSED
THE FIRST OF MARCH HAD ARRIVED
THE SUN WHICH DUBARTAS THAT CLASSIC
ANCESTOR OF PERIPHRASE HAD NOT YET DUBBED THE GRAND DUKE OF CANDLES
WAS NONE THE LESS RADIANT AND JOYOUS ON THAT ACCOUNT
IT WAS ONE OF
THOSE SPRING DAYS WHICH POSSESSES SO MUCH SWEETNESS AND BEAUTY THAT ALL
PARIS TURNS OUT INTO THE SQUARES AND PROMENADES AND CELEBRATES THEM
AS THOUGH THEY WERE SUNDAYS
IN THOSE DAYS OF BRILLIANCY WARMTH AND
SERENITY THERE IS A CERTAIN HOUR ABOVE ALL OTHERS WHEN THE FAADE OF
NOTRE DAME SHOULD BE ADMIRED
IT IS THE MOMENT WHEN THE SUN ALREADY
DECLINING TOWARDS THE WEST LOOKS THE CATHEDRAL ALMOST FULL IN THE FACE
ITS RAYS GROWING MORE AND MORE HORIZONTAL WITHDRAW SLOWLY FROM THE
PAVEMENT OF THE SQUARE AND MOUNT UP THE PERPENDICULAR FAADE WHOSE
THOUSAND BOSSES IN HIGH RELIEF THEY CAUSE TO START OUT FROM THE SHADOWS
WHILE THE GREAT CENTRAL ROSE WINDOW FLAMES LIKE THE EYE OF A CYCLOPS
INFLAMED WITH THE REFLECTIONS OF THE FORGE
THIS WAS THE HOUR
OPPOSITE THE LOFTY CATHEDRAL REDDENED BY THE SETTING SUN ON THE STONE
BALCONY BUILT ABOVE THE PORCH OF A RICH GOTHIC HOUSE WHICH FORMED THE
ANGLE OF THE SQUARE AND THE RUE DU PARVIS SEVERAL YOUNG GIRLS WERE
LAUGHING AND CHATTING WITH EVERY SORT OF GRACE AND MIRTH
FROM THE
LENGTH OF THE VEIL WHICH FELL FROM THEIR POINTED COIF TWINED WITH
PEARLS TO THEIR HEELS FROM THE FINENESS OF THE EMBROIDERED CHEMISETTE
WHICH COVERED THEIR SHOULDERS AND ALLOWED A GLIMPSE ACCORDING TO THE
PLEASING CUSTOM OF THE TIME OF THE SWELL OF THEIR FAIR VIRGIN BOSOMS
FROM THE OPULENCE OF THEIR UNDER PETTICOATS STILL MORE PRECIOUS THAN
THEIR OVERDRESS MARVELLOUS REFINEMENT FROM THE GAUZE THE SILK
THE VELVET WITH WHICH ALL THIS WAS COMPOSED AND ABOVE ALL FROM THE
WHITENESS OF THEIR HANDS WHICH CERTIFIED TO THEIR LEISURE AND IDLENESS
IT WAS EASY TO DIVINE THEY WERE NOBLE AND WEALTHY HEIRESSES
THEY WERE
IN FACT DAMOISELLE FLEUR DE LYS DE GONDELAURIER AND HER COMPANIONS
DIANE DE CHRISTEUIL AMELOTTE DE MONTMICHEL COLOMBE DE GAILLEFONTAINE
AND THE LITTLE DE CHAMPCHEVRIER MAIDEN ALL DAMSELS OF GOOD BIRTH
ASSEMBLED AT THAT MOMENT AT THE HOUSE OF THE DAME WIDOW DE GONDELAURIER
ON ACCOUNT OF MONSEIGNEUR DE BEAUJEU AND MADAME HIS WIFE WHO WERE TO
COME TO PARIS IN THE MONTH OF APRIL THERE TO CHOOSE MAIDS OF HONOR FOR
THE DAUPHINESS MARGUERITE WHO WAS TO BE RECEIVED IN PICARDY FROM THE
HANDS OF THE FLEMINGS
NOW ALL THE SQUIRES FOR TWENTY LEAGUES AROUND
WERE INTRIGUING FOR THIS FAVOR FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS AND A GOODLY NUMBER
OF THE LATTER HAD BEEN ALREADY BROUGHT OR SENT TO PARIS
THESE FOUR
MAIDENS HAD BEEN CONFIDED TO THE DISCREET AND VENERABLE CHARGE OF
MADAME ALOISE DE GONDELAURIER WIDOW OF A FORMER COMMANDER OF THE KING'S
CROSS BOWMEN WHO HAD RETIRED WITH HER ONLY DAUGHTER TO HER HOUSE IN THE
PLACE DU PARVIS NOTRE DAME IN PARIS
THE BALCONY ON WHICH THESE YOUNG GIRLS STOOD OPENED FROM A CHAMBER
RICHLY TAPESTRIED IN FAWN COLORED FLANDERS LEATHER STAMPED WITH GOLDEN
FOLIAGE
THE BEAMS WHICH CUT THE CEILING IN PARALLEL LINES DIVERTED
THE EYE WITH A THOUSAND ECCENTRIC PAINTED AND GILDED CARVINGS
SPLENDID
ENAMELS GLEAMED HERE AND THERE ON CARVED CHESTS A BOAR'S HEAD IN
FAIENCE CROWNED A MAGNIFICENT DRESSER WHOSE TWO SHELVES ANNOUNCED THAT
THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE WAS THE WIFE OR WIDOW OF A KNIGHT BANNERET
AT
THE END OF THE ROOM BY THE SIDE OF A LOFTY CHIMNEY BLAZONED WITH
ARMS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM IN A RICH RED VELVET ARM CHAIR SAT DAME DE
GONDELAURIER WHOSE FIVE AND FIFTY YEARS WERE WRITTEN UPON HER GARMENTS
NO LESS DISTINCTLY THAN UPON HER FACE
BESIDE HER STOOD A YOUNG MAN OF IMPOSING MIEN ALTHOUGH PARTAKING
SOMEWHAT OF VANITY AND BRAVADO ONE OF THOSE HANDSOME FELLOWS WHOM ALL
WOMEN AGREE TO ADMIRE ALTHOUGH GRAVE MEN LEARNED IN PHYSIOGNOMY SHRUG
THEIR SHOULDERS AT THEM
THIS YOUNG MAN WORE THE GARB OF A CAPTAIN OF
THE KING'S UNATTACHED ARCHERS WHICH BEARS FAR TOO MUCH RESEMBLANCE TO
THE COSTUME OF JUPITER WHICH THE READER HAS ALREADY BEEN ENABLED TO
ADMIRE IN THE FIRST BOOK OF THIS HISTORY FOR US TO INFLICT UPON HIM A
SECOND DESCRIPTION
THE DAMOISELLES WERE SEATED A PART IN THE CHAMBER A PART IN THE
BALCONY SOME ON SQUARE CUSHIONS OF UTRECHT VELVET WITH GOLDEN CORNERS
OTHERS ON STOOLS OF OAK CARVED IN FLOWERS AND FIGURES
EACH OF THEM HELD
ON HER KNEE A SECTION OF A GREAT NEEDLEWORK TAPESTRY ON WHICH THEY
WERE WORKING IN COMPANY WHILE ONE END OF IT LAY UPON THE RUSH MAT WHICH
COVERED THE FLOOR
THEY WERE CHATTING TOGETHER IN THAT WHISPERING TONE AND WITH THE
HALF STIFLED LAUGHS PECULIAR TO AN ASSEMBLY OF YOUNG GIRLS IN WHOSE
MIDST THERE IS A YOUNG MAN
THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE PRESENCE SERVED TO SET
IN PLAY ALL THESE FEMININE SELF CONCEITS APPEARED TO PAY VERY LITTLE
HEED TO THE MATTER AND WHILE THESE PRETTY DAMSELS WERE VYING WITH ONE
ANOTHER TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION HE SEEMED TO BE CHIEFLY ABSORBED IN
POLISHING THE BUCKLE OF HIS SWORD BELT WITH HIS DOESKIN GLOVE
FROM TIME
TO TIME THE OLD LADY ADDRESSED HIM IN A VERY LOW TONE AND HE
REPLIED AS WELL AS HE WAS ABLE WITH A SORT OF AWKWARD AND CONSTRAINED
POLITENESS
FROM THE SMILES AND SIGNIFICANT GESTURES OF DAME ALOISE FROM THE
GLANCES WHICH SHE THREW TOWARDS HER DAUGHTER FLEUR DE LYS AS SHE SPOKE
LOW TO THE CAPTAIN IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THERE WAS HERE A QUESTION OF
SOME BETROTHAL CONCLUDED SOME MARRIAGE NEAR AT HAND NO DOUBT BETWEEN
THE YOUNG MAN AND FLEUR DE LYS
FROM THE EMBARRASSED COLDNESS OF THE
OFFICER IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT ON HIS SIDE AT LEAST LOVE HAD
NO LONGER ANY PART IN THE MATTER
HIS WHOLE AIR WAS EXPRESSIVE OF
CONSTRAINT AND WEARINESS WHICH OUR LIEUTENANTS OF THE GARRISON WOULD
TO DAY TRANSLATE ADMIRABLY AS WHAT A BEASTLY BORE
THE POOR DAME VERY MUCH INFATUATED WITH HER DAUGHTER LIKE ANY OTHER
SILLY MOTHER DID NOT PERCEIVE THE OFFICER'S LACK OF ENTHUSIASM AND
STROVE IN LOW TONES TO CALL HIS ATTENTION TO THE INFINITE GRACE WITH
WHICH FLEUR DE LYS USED HER NEEDLE OR WOUND HER SKEIN
COME LITTLE COUSIN SHE SAID TO HIM PLUCKING HIM BY THE SLEEVE IN
ORDER TO SPEAK IN HIS EAR LOOK AT HER DO SEE HER STOOP
YES TRULY REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN AND FELL BACK INTO HIS GLACIAL AND
ABSENT MINDED SILENCE
A MOMENT LATER HE WAS OBLIGED TO BEND DOWN AGAIN AND DAME ALOISE SAID
TO HIM
HAVE YOU EVER BEHELD A MORE GAY AND CHARMING FACE THAN THAT OF YOUR
BETROTHED CAN ONE BE MORE WHITE AND BLONDE ARE NOT HER HANDS PERFECT
AND THAT NECK DOES IT NOT ASSUME ALL THE CURVES OF THE SWAN IN
RAVISHING FASHION HOW I ENVY YOU AT TIMES AND HOW HAPPY YOU ARE TO BE
A MAN NAUGHTY LIBERTINE THAT YOU ARE IS NOT MY FLEUR DE LYS ADORABLY
BEAUTIFUL AND ARE YOU NOT DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH HER
OF COURSE HE REPLIED STILL THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
BUT DO SAY SOMETHING SAID MADAME ALOISE SUDDENLY GIVING HIS SHOULDER
A PUSH YOU HAVE GROWN VERY TIMID
WE CAN ASSURE OUR READERS THAT TIMIDITY WAS NEITHER THE CAPTAIN'S VIRTUE
NOR HIS DEFECT
BUT HE MADE AN EFFORT TO DO WHAT WAS DEMANDED OF HIM
FAIR COUSIN HE SAID APPROACHING FLEUR DE LYS WHAT IS THE SUBJECT
OF THIS TAPESTRY WORK WHICH YOU ARE FASHIONING FAIR COUSIN
RESPONDED FLEUR DE LYS IN AN OFFENDED TONE I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU
THREE TIMES
'TIS THE GROTTO OF NEPTUNE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT FLEUR DE LYS SAW MUCH MORE CLEARLY THAN HER MOTHER
THROUGH THE CAPTAIN'S COLD AND ABSENT MINDED MANNER
HE FELT THE
NECESSITY OF MAKING SOME CONVERSATION
AND FOR WHOM IS THIS NEPTUNERIE DESTINED
FOR THE ABBEY OF SAINT ANTOINE DES CHAMPS ANSWERED FLEUR DE LYS
WITHOUT RAISING HER EYES
THE CAPTAIN TOOK UP A CORNER OF THE TAPESTRY
WHO MY FAIR COUSIN IS THIS BIG GENDARME WHO IS PUFFING OUT HIS
CHEEKS TO THEIR FULL EXTENT AND BLOWING A TRUMPET
'TIS TRITON SHE REPLIED
THERE WAS A RATHER PETTISH INTONATION IN FLEUR DE LYS'S LACONIC WORDS
THE YOUNG MAN UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT HE SHOULD
WHISPER SOMETHING IN HER EAR A COMMONPLACE A GALLANT COMPLIMENT NO
MATTER WHAT
ACCORDINGLY HE BENT DOWN BUT HE COULD FIND NOTHING IN HIS
IMAGINATION MORE TENDER AND PERSONAL THAN THIS
WHY DOES YOUR MOTHER ALWAYS WEAR THAT SURCOAT WITH ARMORIAL DESIGNS
LIKE OUR GRANDMOTHERS OF THE TIME OF CHARLES VII TELL HER FAIR
COUSIN THAT 'TIS NO LONGER THE FASHION AND THAT THE HINGE GOND
AND THE LAUREL LAURIER EMBROIDERED ON HER ROBE GIVE HER THE AIR OF
A WALKING MANTLEPIECE
IN TRUTH PEOPLE NO LONGER SIT THUS ON THEIR
BANNERS I ASSURE YOU
FLEUR DE LYS RAISED HER BEAUTIFUL EYES FULL OF REPROACH IS THAT ALL
OF WHICH YOU CAN ASSURE ME SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
IN THE MEANTIME DAME ALOISE DELIGHTED TO SEE THEM THUS BENDING TOWARDS
EACH OTHER AND WHISPERING SAID AS SHE TOYED WITH THE CLASPS OF HER
PRAYER BOOK
TOUCHING PICTURE OF LOVE
THE CAPTAIN MORE AND MORE EMBARRASSED FELL BACK UPON THE SUBJECT OF
THE TAPESTRY 'TIS IN SOOTH A CHARMING WORK HE EXCLAIMED
WHEREUPON COLOMBE DE GAILLEFONTAINE ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL BLONDE WITH A
WHITE SKIN DRESSED TO THE NECK IN BLUE DAMASK VENTURED A TIMID REMARK
WHICH SHE ADDRESSED TO FLEUR DE LYS IN THE HOPE THAT THE HANDSOME
CAPTAIN WOULD REPLY TO IT MY DEAR GONDELAURIER HAVE YOU SEEN THE
TAPESTRIES OF THE HTEL DE LA ROCHE GUYON
IS NOT THAT THE HOTEL IN WHICH IS ENCLOSED THE GARDEN OF THE LINGRE
DU LOUVRE ASKED DIANE DE CHRISTEUIL WITH A LAUGH FOR SHE HAD HANDSOME
TEETH AND CONSEQUENTLY LAUGHED ON EVERY OCCASION
AND WHERE THERE IS THAT BIG OLD TOWER OF THE ANCIENT WALL OF PARIS
ADDED AMELOTTE DE MONTMICHEL A PRETTY FRESH AND CURLY HEADED BRUNETTE
WHO HAD A HABIT OF SIGHING JUST AS THE OTHER LAUGHED WITHOUT KNOWING
WHY
MY DEAR COLOMBE INTERPOLATED DAME ALOISE DO YOU NOT MEAN THE HOTEL
WHICH BELONGED TO MONSIEUR DE BACQUEVILLE IN THE REIGN OF KING CHARLES
VI THERE ARE INDEED MANY SUPERB HIGH WARP TAPESTRIES THERE
CHARLES VI CHARLES VI MUTTERED THE YOUNG CAPTAIN TWIRLING HIS
MOUSTACHE
GOOD HEAVENS WHAT OLD THINGS THE GOOD DAME DOES REMEMBER
MADAME DE GONDELAURIER CONTINUED FINE TAPESTRIES IN TRUTH
A WORK SO
ESTEEMED THAT IT PASSES AS UNRIVALLED
AT THAT MOMENT BRANGRE DE CHAMPCHEVRIER A SLENDER LITTLE MAID OF
SEVEN YEARS WHO WAS PEERING INTO THE SQUARE THROUGH THE TREFOILS OF
THE BALCONY EXCLAIMED OH LOOK FAIR GODMOTHER FLEUR DE LYS AT THAT
PRETTY DANCER WHO IS DANCING ON THE PAVEMENT AND PLAYING THE TAMBOURINE
IN THE MIDST OF THE LOUTISH BOURGEOIS
THE SONOROUS VIBRATION OF A TAMBOURINE WAS IN FACT AUDIBLE
SOME
GYPSY FROM BOHEMIA SAID FLEUR DE LYS TURNING CARELESSLY TOWARD THE
SQUARE
LOOK LOOK EXCLAIMED HER LIVELY COMPANIONS AND THEY ALL RAN TO THE
EDGE OF THE BALCONY WHILE FLEUR DE LYS RENDERED THOUGHTFUL BY THE
COLDNESS OF HER BETROTHED FOLLOWED THEM SLOWLY AND THE LATTER
RELIEVED BY THIS INCIDENT WHICH PUT AN END TO AN EMBARRASSING
CONVERSATION RETREATED TO THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM WITH THE
SATISFIED AIR OF A SOLDIER RELEASED FROM DUTY
NEVERTHELESS THE
FAIR FLEUR DE LYS'S WAS A CHARMING AND NOBLE SERVICE AND SUCH IT HAD
FORMERLY APPEARED TO HIM BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD GRADUALLY BECOME BLASE'
THE PROSPECT OF A SPEEDY MARRIAGE COOLED HIM MORE EVERY DAY
MOREOVER
HE WAS OF A FICKLE DISPOSITION AND MUST WE SAY IT RATHER VULGAR IN
TASTE
ALTHOUGH OF VERY NOBLE BIRTH HE HAD CONTRACTED IN HIS OFFICIAL
HARNESS MORE THAN ONE HABIT OF THE COMMON TROOPER
THE TAVERN AND ITS
ACCOMPANIMENTS PLEASED HIM
HE WAS ONLY AT HIS EASE AMID GROSS LANGUAGE
MILITARY GALLANTRIES FACILE BEAUTIES AND SUCCESSES YET MORE EASY
HE HAD NEVERTHELESS RECEIVED FROM HIS FAMILY SOME EDUCATION AND SOME
POLITENESS OF MANNER BUT HE HAD BEEN THROWN ON THE WORLD TOO YOUNG HE
HAD BEEN IN GARRISON AT TOO EARLY AN AGE AND EVERY DAY THE POLISH OF
A GENTLEMAN BECAME MORE AND MORE EFFACED BY THE ROUGH FRICTION OF HIS
GENDARME'S CROSS BELT
WHILE STILL CONTINUING TO VISIT HER FROM TIME TO
TIME FROM A REMNANT OF COMMON RESPECT HE FELT DOUBLY EMBARRASSED WITH
FLEUR DE LYS IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE IN CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING
SCATTERED HIS LOVE IN ALL SORTS OF PLACES HE HAD RESERVED VERY LITTLE
FOR HER IN THE NEXT PLACE BECAUSE AMID SO MANY STIFF FORMAL AND
DECENT LADIES HE WAS IN CONSTANT FEAR LEST HIS MOUTH HABITUATED TO
OATHS SHOULD SUDDENLY TAKE THE BIT IN ITS TEETH AND BREAK OUT INTO THE
LANGUAGE OF THE TAVERN
THE EFFECT CAN BE IMAGINED
MOREOVER ALL THIS WAS MINGLED IN HIM WITH GREAT PRETENTIONS TO
ELEGANCE TOILET AND A FINE APPEARANCE
LET THE READER RECONCILE THESE
THINGS AS BEST HE CAN
I AM SIMPLY THE HISTORIAN
HE HAD REMAINED THEREFORE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES LEANING IN SILENCE
AGAINST THE CARVED JAMB OF THE CHIMNEY AND THINKING OR NOT THINKING
WHEN FLEUR DE LYS SUDDENLY TURNED AND ADDRESSED HIM
AFTER ALL THE POOR
YOUNG GIRL WAS POUTING AGAINST THE DICTATES OF HER HEART
FAIR COUSIN DID YOU NOT SPEAK TO US OF A LITTLE BOHEMIAN WHOM YOU
SAVED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WHILE MAKING THE PATROL WITH THE WATCH AT
NIGHT FROM THE HANDS OF A DOZEN ROBBERS
I BELIEVE SO FAIR COUSIN SAID THE CAPTAIN
WELL SHE RESUMED PERCHANCE 'TIS THAT SAME GYPSY GIRL WHO IS DANCING
YONDER ON THE CHURCH SQUARE
COME AND SEE IF YOU RECOGNIZE HER FAIR
COUSIN PHOEBUS
A SECRET DESIRE FOR RECONCILIATION WAS APPARENT IN THIS GENTLE
INVITATION WHICH SHE GAVE HIM TO APPROACH HER AND IN THE CARE WHICH SHE
TOOK TO CALL HIM BY NAME
CAPTAIN PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS FOR IT IS
HE WHOM THE READER HAS HAD BEFORE HIS EYES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS
CHAPTER SLOWLY APPROACHED THE BALCONY
STAY SAID FLEUR DE LYS
LAYING HER HAND TENDERLY ON PHOEBUS'S ARM LOOK AT THAT LITTLE GIRL
YONDER DANCING IN THAT CIRCLE
IS SHE YOUR BOHEMIAN
PHOEBUS LOOKED AND SAID
YES I RECOGNIZE HER BY HER GOAT
OH IN FACT WHAT A PRETTY LITTLE GOAT SAID AMELOTTE CLASPING HER
HANDS IN ADMIRATION
ARE HIS HORNS OF REAL GOLD INQUIRED BRANGRE
WITHOUT MOVING FROM HER ARM CHAIR DAME ALOISE INTERPOSED IS SHE NOT
ONE OF THOSE GYPSY GIRLS WHO ARRIVED LAST YEAR BY THE GIBARD GATE
MADAME MY MOTHER SAID FLEUR DE LYS GENTLY THAT GATE IS NOW CALLED
THE PORTE D'ENFER
MADEMOISELLE DE GONDELAURIER KNEW HOW HER MOTHER'S ANTIQUATED MODE OF
SPEECH SHOCKED THE CAPTAIN
IN FACT HE BEGAN TO SNEER AND MUTTERED
BETWEEN HIS TEETH PORTE GIBARD PORTE GIBARD 'TIS ENOUGH TO MAKE KING
CHARLES VI
PASS BY
GODMOTHER EXCLAIMED BRANGRE WHOSE EYES INCESSANTLY IN MOTION HAD
SUDDENLY BEEN RAISED TO THE SUMMIT OF THE TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME WHO IS
THAT BLACK MAN UP YONDER
ALL THE YOUNG GIRLS RAISED THEIR EYES
A MAN WAS IN TRUTH LEANING
ON THE BALUSTRADE WHICH SURMOUNTED THE NORTHERN TOWER LOOKING ON THE
GRVE
HE WAS A PRIEST
HIS COSTUME COULD BE PLAINLY DISCERNED AND HIS
FACE RESTING ON BOTH HIS HANDS
BUT HE STIRRED NO MORE THAN IF HE HAD
BEEN A STATUE
HIS EYES INTENTLY FIXED GAZED INTO THE PLACE
IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE IMMOBILITY OF A BIRD OF PREY WHO HAS JUST
DISCOVERED A NEST OF SPARROWS AND IS GAZING AT IT
'TIS MONSIEUR THE ARCHDEACON OF JOSAS SAID FLEUR DE LYS
YOU HAVE GOOD EYES IF YOU CAN RECOGNIZE HIM FROM HERE SAID THE
GAILLEFONTAINE
HOW HE IS STARING AT THE LITTLE DANCER WENT ON DIANE DE CHRISTEUIL
LET THE GYPSY BEWARE SAID FLEUR DE LYS FOR HE LOVES NOT EGYPT
'TIS A GREAT SHAME FOR THAT MAN TO LOOK UPON HER THUS ADDED AMELOTTE
DE MONTMICHEL FOR SHE DANCES DELIGHTFULLY
FAIR COUSIN PHOEBUS SAID FLEUR DE LYS SUDDENLY SINCE YOU KNOW THIS
LITTLE GYPSY MAKE HER A SIGN TO COME UP HERE
IT WILL AMUSE US
OH YES EXCLAIMED ALL THE YOUNG GIRLS CLAPPING THEIR HANDS
WHY 'TIS NOT WORTH WHILE REPLIED PHOEBUS
SHE HAS FORGOTTEN ME NO
DOUBT AND I KNOW NOT SO MUCH AS HER NAME
NEVERTHELESS AS YOU WISH IT
YOUNG LADIES I WILL MAKE THE TRIAL AND LEANING OVER THE BALUSTRADE OF
THE BALCONY HE BEGAN TO SHOUT LITTLE ONE
THE DANCER WAS NOT BEATING HER TAMBOURINE AT THE MOMENT
SHE TURNED HER
HEAD TOWARDS THE POINT WHENCE THIS CALL PROCEEDED HER BRILLIANT EYES
RESTED ON PHOEBUS AND SHE STOPPED SHORT
LITTLE ONE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN AND HE BECKONED HER TO APPROACH
THE YOUNG GIRL LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN THEN SHE BLUSHED AS THOUGH A FLAME
HAD MOUNTED INTO HER CHEEKS AND TAKING HER TAMBOURINE UNDER HER ARM
SHE MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE ASTONISHED SPECTATORS TOWARDS THE DOOR OF
THE HOUSE WHERE PHOEBUS WAS CALLING HER WITH SLOW TOTTERING STEPS AND
WITH THE TROUBLED LOOK OF A BIRD WHICH IS YIELDING TO THE FASCINATION OF
A SERPENT
A MOMENT LATER THE TAPESTRY PORTIRE WAS RAISED AND THE GYPSY APPEARED
ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE CHAMBER BLUSHING CONFUSED BREATHLESS HER
LARGE EYES DROOPING AND NOT DARING TO ADVANCE ANOTHER STEP
BRANGRE CLAPPED HER HANDS
MEANWHILE THE DANCER REMAINED MOTIONLESS UPON THE THRESHOLD
HER
APPEARANCE HAD PRODUCED A SINGULAR EFFECT UPON THESE YOUNG GIRLS
IT
IS CERTAIN THAT A VAGUE AND INDISTINCT DESIRE TO PLEASE THE HANDSOME
OFFICER ANIMATED THEM ALL THAT HIS SPLENDID UNIFORM WAS THE TARGET OF
ALL THEIR COQUETRIES AND THAT FROM THE MOMENT HE PRESENTED HIMSELF
THERE EXISTED AMONG THEM A SECRET SUPPRESSED RIVALRY WHICH THEY HARDLY
ACKNOWLEDGED EVEN TO THEMSELVES BUT WHICH BROKE FORTH NONE THE LESS
EVERY INSTANT IN THEIR GESTURES AND REMARKS
NEVERTHELESS AS THEY WERE
ALL VERY NEARLY EQUAL IN BEAUTY THEY CONTENDED WITH EQUAL ARMS AND
EACH COULD HOPE FOR THE VICTORY THE ARRIVAL OF THE GYPSY SUDDENLY
DESTROYED THIS EQUILIBRIUM
HER BEAUTY WAS SO RARE THAT AT THE MOMENT
WHEN SHE APPEARED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE APARTMENT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH
SHE DIFFUSED A SORT OF LIGHT WHICH WAS PECULIAR TO HERSELF
IN THAT
NARROW CHAMBER SURROUNDED BY THAT SOMBRE FRAME OF HANGINGS AND
WOODWORK SHE WAS INCOMPARABLY MORE BEAUTIFUL AND MORE RADIANT THAN ON
THE PUBLIC SQUARE
SHE WAS LIKE A TORCH WHICH HAS SUDDENLY BEEN BROUGHT
FROM BROAD DAYLIGHT INTO THE DARK
THE NOBLE DAMSELS WERE DAZZLED BY HER
IN SPITE OF THEMSELVES
EACH ONE FELT HERSELF IN SOME SORT WOUNDED
IN HER BEAUTY
HENCE THEIR BATTLE FRONT MAY WE BE ALLOWED THE
EXPRESSION WAS IMMEDIATELY ALTERED ALTHOUGH THEY EXCHANGED NOT A
SINGLE WORD
BUT THEY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY
WOMEN'S INSTINCTS
COMPREHEND AND RESPOND TO EACH OTHER MORE QUICKLY THAN THE INTELLIGENCES
OF MEN
AN ENEMY HAD JUST ARRIVED ALL FELT IT ALL RALLIED TOGETHER
ONE DROP OF WINE IS SUFFICIENT TO TINGE A GLASS OF WATER RED TO DIFFUSE
A CERTAIN DEGREE OF ILL TEMPER THROUGHOUT A WHOLE ASSEMBLY OF PRETTY
WOMEN THE ARRIVAL OF A PRETTIER WOMAN SUFFICES ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE
IS BUT ONE MAN PRESENT
HENCE THE WELCOME ACCORDED TO THE GYPSY WAS MARVELLOUSLY GLACIAL
THEY
SURVEYED HER FROM HEAD TO FOOT THEN EXCHANGED GLANCES AND ALL WAS
SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER
MEANWHILE THE YOUNG GIRL WAS WAITING
TO BE SPOKEN TO IN SUCH EMOTION THAT SHE DARED NOT RAISE HER EYELIDS
THE CAPTAIN WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE
UPON MY WORD SAID
HE IN HIS TONE OF INTREPID FATUITY HERE IS A CHARMING CREATURE WHAT
THINK YOU OF HER FAIR COUSIN
THIS REMARK WHICH A MORE DELICATE ADMIRER WOULD HAVE UTTERED IN A LOWER
TONE AT LEAST WAS NOT OF A NATURE TO DISSIPATE THE FEMININE JEALOUSIES
WHICH WERE ON THE ALERT BEFORE THE GYPSY
FLEUR DE LYS REPLIED TO THE CAPTAIN WITH A BLAND AFFECTATION OF
DISDAIN NOT BAD
THE OTHERS WHISPERED
AT LENGTH MADAME ALOISE WHO WAS NOT THE LESS JEALOUS BECAUSE SHE WAS
SO FOR HER DAUGHTER ADDRESSED THE DANCER APPROACH LITTLE ONE
APPROACH LITTLE ONE REPEATED WITH COMICAL DIGNITY LITTLE
BRANGRE WHO WOULD HAVE REACHED ABOUT AS HIGH AS HER HIPS
THE GYPSY ADVANCED TOWARDS THE NOBLE DAME
FAIR CHILD SAID PHOEBUS WITH EMPHASIS TAKING SEVERAL STEPS TOWARDS
HER I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I HAVE THE SUPREME HONOR OF BEING RECOGNIZED
BY YOU
SHE INTERRUPTED HIM WITH A SMILE AND A LOOK FULL OF INFINITE
SWEETNESS
OH YES SAID SHE
SHE HAS A GOOD MEMORY REMARKED FLEUR DE LYS
COME NOW RESUMED PHOEBUS YOU ESCAPED NIMBLY THE OTHER EVENING
DID
I FRIGHTEN YOU
OH NO SAID THE GYPSY
THERE WAS IN THE INTONATION OF THAT OH NO UTTERED AFTER THAT OH
YES AN INEFFABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOUNDED FLEUR DE LYS
YOU LEFT ME IN YOUR STEAD MY BEAUTY PURSUED THE CAPTAIN WHOSE
TONGUE WAS UNLOOSED WHEN SPEAKING TO A GIRL OUT OF THE STREET A
CRABBED KNAVE ONE EYED AND HUNCHBACKED THE BISHOP'S BELLRINGER
I BELIEVE
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT BY BIRTH HE IS THE BASTARD OF
AN ARCHDEACON AND A DEVIL
HE HAS A PLEASANT NAME HE IS CALLED
QUATRE TEMPS EMBER DAYS PAQUES FLEURIES PALM SUNDAY MARDI GRAS
SHROVE TUESDAY I KNOW NOT WHAT THE NAME OF SOME FESTIVAL WHEN THE
BELLS ARE PEALED SO HE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF CARRYING YOU OFF AS THOUGH
YOU WERE MADE FOR BEADLES 'TIS TOO MUCH
WHAT THE DEVIL DID THAT
SCREECH OWL WANT WITH YOU HEY TELL ME
I DO NOT KNOW SHE REPLIED
THE INCONCEIVABLE IMPUDENCE A BELLRINGER CARRYING OFF A WENCH LIKE A
VICOMTE A LOUT POACHING ON THE GAME OF GENTLEMEN THAT IS A RARE PIECE
OF ASSURANCE
HOWEVER HE PAID DEARLY FOR IT
MASTER PIERRAT TORTERUE IS
THE HARSHEST GROOM THAT EVER CURRIED A KNAVE AND I CAN TELL YOU IF
IT WILL BE AGREEABLE TO YOU THAT YOUR BELLRINGER'S HIDE GOT A THOROUGH
DRESSING AT HIS HANDS
POOR MAN SAID THE GYPSY IN WHOM THESE WORDS REVIVED THE MEMORY OF
THE PILLORY
THE CAPTAIN BURST OUT LAUGHING
CORNE DE BOEUF HERE'S PITY AS WELL PLACED AS A FEATHER IN A PIG'S
TAIL MAY I HAVE AS BIG A BELLY AS A POPE IF
HE STOPPED SHORT
PARDON ME LADIES I BELIEVE THAT I WAS ON THE POINT
OF SAYING SOMETHING FOOLISH
FIE SIR SAID LA GAILLEFONTAINE
HE TALKS TO THAT CREATURE IN HER OWN TONGUE ADDED FLEUR DE LYS IN
A LOW TONE HER IRRITATION INCREASING EVERY MOMENT
THIS IRRITATION WAS
NOT DIMINISHED WHEN SHE BEHELD THE CAPTAIN ENCHANTED WITH THE GYPSY
AND MOST OF ALL WITH HIMSELF EXECUTE A PIROUETTE ON HIS HEEL
REPEATING WITH COARSE NAVE AND SOLDIERLY GALLANTRY
A HANDSOME WENCH UPON MY SOUL
RATHER SAVAGELY DRESSED SAID DIANE DE CHRISTEUIL LAUGHING TO SHOW
HER FINE TEETH
THIS REMARK WAS A FLASH OF LIGHT TO THE OTHERS
NOT BEING ABLE TO IMPUGN
HER BEAUTY THEY ATTACKED HER COSTUME
THAT IS TRUE SAID LA MONTMICHEL WHAT MAKES YOU RUN ABOUT THE
STREETS THUS WITHOUT GUIMPE OR RUFF
THAT PETTICOAT IS SO SHORT THAT IT MAKES ONE TREMBLE ADDED LA
GAILLEFONTAINE
MY DEAR CONTINUED FLEUR DE LYS WITH DECIDED SHARPNESS YOU WILL GET
YOURSELF TAKEN UP BY THE SUMPTUARY POLICE FOR YOUR GILDED GIRDLE
LITTLE ONE LITTLE ONE RESUMED LA CHRISTEUIL WITH AN IMPLACABLE
SMILE IF YOU WERE TO PUT RESPECTABLE SLEEVES UPON YOUR ARMS THEY WOULD
GET LESS SUNBURNED
IT WAS IN TRUTH A SPECTACLE WORTHY OF A MORE INTELLIGENT SPECTATOR
THAN PHOEBUS TO SEE HOW THESE BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS WITH THEIR ENVENOMED
AND ANGRY TONGUES WOUND SERPENT LIKE AND GLIDED AND WRITHED AROUND
THE STREET DANCER
THEY WERE CRUEL AND GRACEFUL THEY SEARCHED AND
RUMMAGED MALICIOUSLY IN HER POOR AND SILLY TOILET OF SPANGLES AND
TINSEL
THERE WAS NO END TO THEIR LAUGHTER IRONY AND HUMILIATION
SARCASMS RAINED DOWN UPON THE GYPSY AND HAUGHTY CONDESCENSION AND
MALEVOLENT LOOKS
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY WERE YOUNG ROMAN DAMES
THRUSTING GOLDEN PINS INTO THE BREAST OF A BEAUTIFUL SLAVE
ONE WOULD
HAVE PRONOUNCED THEM ELEGANT GRAYHOUNDS CIRCLING WITH INFLATED
NOSTRILS ROUND A POOR WOODLAND FAWN WHOM THE GLANCE OF THEIR MASTER
FORBADE THEM TO DEVOUR
AFTER ALL WHAT WAS A MISERABLE DANCER ON THE PUBLIC SQUARES IN THE
PRESENCE OF THESE HIGH BORN MAIDENS THEY SEEMED TO TAKE NO HEED OF HER
PRESENCE AND TALKED OF HER ALOUD TO HER FACE AS OF SOMETHING UNCLEAN
ABJECT AND YET AT THE SAME TIME PASSABLY PRETTY
THE GYPSY WAS NOT INSENSIBLE TO THESE PIN PRICKS
FROM TIME TO TIME A
FLUSH OF SHAME A FLASH OF ANGER INFLAMED HER EYES OR HER CHEEKS WITH
DISDAIN SHE MADE THAT LITTLE GRIMACE WITH WHICH THE READER IS ALREADY
FAMILIAR BUT SHE REMAINED MOTIONLESS SHE FIXED ON PHOEBUS A SAD
SWEET RESIGNED LOOK
THERE WAS ALSO HAPPINESS AND TENDERNESS IN THAT
GAZE
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT SHE ENDURED FOR FEAR OF BEING EXPELLED
PHOEBUS LAUGHED AND TOOK THE GYPSY'S PART WITH A MIXTURE OF
IMPERTINENCE AND PITY
LET THEM TALK LITTLE ONE HE REPEATED JINGLING HIS GOLDEN SPURS
NO
DOUBT YOUR TOILET IS A LITTLE EXTRAVAGANT AND WILD BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE WITH SUCH A CHARMING DAMSEL AS YOURSELF
GOOD GRACIOUS EXCLAIMED THE BLONDE GAILLEFONTAINE DRAWING UP HER
SWAN LIKE THROAT WITH A BITTER SMILE
I SEE THAT MESSIEURS THE ARCHERS
OF THE KING'S POLICE EASILY TAKE FIRE AT THE HANDSOME EYES OF GYPSIES
WHY NOT SAID PHOEBUS
AT THIS REPLY UTTERED CARELESSLY BY THE CAPTAIN LIKE A STRAY STONE
WHOSE FALL ONE DOES NOT EVEN WATCH COLOMBE BEGAN TO LAUGH AS WELL AS
DIANE AMELOTTE AND FLEUR DE LYS INTO WHOSE EYES AT THE SAME TIME A
TEAR STARTED
THE GYPSY WHO HAD DROPPED HER EYES ON THE FLOOR AT THE WORDS OF COLOMBE
DE GAILLEFONTAINE RAISED THEM BEAMING WITH JOY AND PRIDE AND FIXED THEM
ONCE MORE ON PHOEBUS
SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL AT THAT MOMENT
THE OLD DAME WHO WAS WATCHING THIS SCENE FELT OFFENDED WITHOUT
UNDERSTANDING WHY
HOLY VIRGIN SHE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED WHAT IS IT MOVING ABOUT MY LEGS
AH THE VILLANOUS BEAST
IT WAS THE GOAT WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED IN SEARCH OF HIS MISTRESS AND
WHO IN DASHING TOWARDS THE LATTER HAD BEGUN BY ENTANGLING HIS HORNS IN
THE PILE OF STUFFS WHICH THE NOBLE DAME'S GARMENTS HEAPED UP ON HER FEET
WHEN SHE WAS SEATED
THIS CREATED A DIVERSION
THE GYPSY DISENTANGLED HIS HORNS WITHOUT
UTTERING A WORD
OH HERE'S THE LITTLE GOAT WITH GOLDEN HOOFS EXCLAIMED BRANGRE
DANCING WITH JOY
THE GYPSY CROUCHED DOWN ON HER KNEES AND LEANED HER CHEEK AGAINST THE
FONDLING HEAD OF THE GOAT
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT SHE WAS ASKING
PARDON FOR HAVING QUITTED IT THUS
MEANWHILE DIANE HAD BENT DOWN TO COLOMBE'S EAR
AH GOOD HEAVENS WHY DID NOT I THINK OF THAT SOONER 'TIS THE GYPSY
WITH THE GOAT
THEY SAY SHE IS A SORCERESS AND THAT HER GOAT EXECUTES
VERY MIRACULOUS TRICKS
WELL SAID COLOMBE THE GOAT MUST NOW AMUSE US IN ITS TURN AND
PERFORM A MIRACLE FOR US
DIANE AND COLOMBE EAGERLY ADDRESSED THE GYPSY
LITTLE ONE MAKE YOUR GOAT PERFORM A MIRACLE
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN REPLIED THE DANCER
A MIRACLE A PIECE OF MAGIC A BIT OF SORCERY IN SHORT
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND SHE FELL TO CARESSING THE PRETTY ANIMAL
REPEATING DJALI DJALI
AT THAT MOMENT FLEUR DE LYS NOTICED A LITTLE BAG OF EMBROIDERED LEATHER
SUSPENDED FROM THE NECK OF THE GOAT WHAT IS THAT SHE ASKED OF THE
GYPSY
THE GYPSY RAISED HER LARGE EYES UPON HER AND REPLIED GRAVELY THAT IS
MY SECRET
I SHOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR SECRET IS THOUGHT
FLEUR DE LYS
MEANWHILE THE GOOD DAME HAD RISEN ANGRILY COME NOW GYPSY IF
NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR GOAT CAN DANCE FOR US WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
THE GYPSY WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR WITHOUT MAKING ANY REPLY
BUT THE NEARER SHE APPROACHED IT THE MORE HER PACE SLACKENED
AN
IRRESISTIBLE MAGNET SEEMED TO HOLD HER
SUDDENLY SHE TURNED HER EYES
WET WITH TEARS TOWARDS PHOEBUS AND HALTED
TRUE GOD EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO DEPART
COME
BACK AND DANCE SOMETHING FOR US
BY THE WAY MY SWEET LOVE WHAT IS YOUR
NAME
LA ESMERALDA SAID THE DANCER NEVER TAKING HER EYES FROM HIM
AT THIS STRANGE NAME A BURST OF WILD LAUGHTER BROKE FROM THE YOUNG
GIRLS
HERE'S A TERRIBLE NAME FOR A YOUNG LADY SAID DIANE
YOU SEE WELL ENOUGH RETORTED AMELOTTE THAT SHE IS AN ENCHANTRESS
MY DEAR EXCLAIMED DAME ALOISE SOLEMNLY YOUR PARENTS DID NOT COMMIT
THE SIN OF GIVING YOU THAT NAME AT THE BAPTISMAL FONT
IN THE MEANTIME SEVERAL MINUTES PREVIOUSLY BRANGRE HAD COAXED THE
GOAT INTO A CORNER OF THE ROOM WITH A MARCHPANE CAKE WITHOUT ANY ONE
HAVING NOTICED HER
IN AN INSTANT THEY HAD BECOME GOOD FRIENDS
THE
CURIOUS CHILD HAD DETACHED THE BAG FROM THE GOAT'S NECK HAD OPENED
IT AND HAD EMPTIED OUT ITS CONTENTS ON THE RUSH MATTING IT WAS AN
ALPHABET EACH LETTER OF WHICH WAS SEPARATELY INSCRIBED ON A TINY BLOCK
OF BOXWOOD
HARDLY HAD THESE PLAYTHINGS BEEN SPREAD OUT ON THE MATTING
WHEN THE CHILD WITH SURPRISE BEHELD THE GOAT ONE OF WHOSE MIRACLES
THIS WAS NO DOUBT DRAW OUT CERTAIN LETTERS WITH ITS GOLDEN HOOF AND
ARRANGE THEM WITH GENTLE PUSHES IN A CERTAIN ORDER
IN A MOMENT THEY
CONSTITUTED A WORD WHICH THE GOAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO WRITE
SO LITTLE HESITATION DID IT SHOW IN FORMING IT AND BRANGRE SUDDENLY
EXCLAIMED CLASPING HER HANDS IN ADMIRATION
GODMOTHER FLEUR DE LYS SEE WHAT THE GOAT HAS JUST DONE
FLEUR DE LYS RAN UP AND TREMBLED
THE LETTERS ARRANGED UPON THE FLOOR
FORMED THIS WORD
PHOEBUS
WAS IT THE GOAT WHO WROTE THAT SHE INQUIRED IN A CHANGED VOICE
YES GODMOTHER REPLIED BRANGRE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT IT THE CHILD DID NOT KNOW HOW TO WRITE
THIS IS THE SECRET THOUGHT FLEUR DE LYS
MEANWHILE AT THE CHILD'S EXCLAMATION ALL HAD HASTENED UP THE MOTHER
THE YOUNG GIRLS THE GYPSY AND THE OFFICER
THE GYPSY BEHELD THE PIECE OF FOLLY WHICH THE GOAT HAD COMMITTED
SHE
TURNED RED THEN PALE AND BEGAN TO TREMBLE LIKE A CULPRIT BEFORE THE
CAPTAIN WHO GAZED AT HER WITH A SMILE OF SATISFACTION AND AMAZEMENT
PHOEBUS WHISPERED THE YOUNG GIRLS STUPEFIED 'TIS THE CAPTAIN'S
NAME
YOU HAVE A MARVELLOUS MEMORY SAID FLEUR DE LYS TO THE PETRIFIED
GYPSY
THEN BURSTING INTO SOBS OH SHE STAMMERED MOURNFULLY HIDING
HER FACE IN BOTH HER BEAUTIFUL HANDS SHE IS A MAGICIAN AND SHE
HEARD ANOTHER AND A STILL MORE BITTER VOICE AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART
SAYING SHE IS A RIVAL
SHE FELL FAINTING
MY DAUGHTER MY DAUGHTER CRIED THE TERRIFIED MOTHER
BEGONE YOU
GYPSY OF HELL
IN A TWINKLING LA ESMERALDA GATHERED UP THE UNLUCKY LETTERS MADE A
SIGN TO DJALI AND WENT OUT THROUGH ONE DOOR WHILE FLEUR DE LYS WAS
BEING CARRIED OUT THROUGH THE OTHER
CAPTAIN PHOEBUS ON BEING LEFT ALONE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT BETWEEN THE
TWO DOORS THEN HE FOLLOWED THE GYPSY
CHAPTER II
A PRIEST AND A PHILOSOPHER ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
THE PRIEST WHOM THE YOUNG GIRLS HAD OBSERVED AT THE TOP OF THE NORTH
TOWER LEANING OVER THE PLACE AND SO ATTENTIVE TO THE DANCE OF THE
GYPSY WAS IN FACT ARCHDEACON CLAUDE FROLLO
OUR READERS HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE MYSTERIOUS CELL WHICH THE ARCHDEACON
HAD RESERVED FOR HIMSELF IN THAT TOWER
I DO NOT KNOW BY THE WAY BE
IT SAID WHETHER IT BE NOT THE SAME THE INTERIOR OF WHICH CAN BE SEEN
TO DAY THROUGH A LITTLE SQUARE WINDOW OPENING TO THE EAST AT THE HEIGHT
OF A MAN ABOVE THE PLATFORM FROM WHICH THE TOWERS SPRING A BARE AND
DILAPIDATED DEN WHOSE BADLY PLASTERED WALLS ARE ORNAMENTED HERE
AND THERE AT THE PRESENT DAY WITH SOME WRETCHED YELLOW ENGRAVINGS
REPRESENTING THE FAADES OF CATHEDRALS
I PRESUME THAT THIS HOLE IS
JOINTLY INHABITED BY BATS AND SPIDERS AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY IT WAGES
A DOUBLE WAR OF EXTERMINATION ON THE FLIES
EVERY DAY AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET THE ARCHDEACON ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE
TO THE TOWER AND SHUT HIMSELF UP IN THIS CELL WHERE HE SOMETIMES
PASSED WHOLE NIGHTS
THAT DAY AT THE MOMENT WHEN STANDING BEFORE THE
LOW DOOR OF HIS RETREAT HE WAS FITTING INTO THE LOCK THE COMPLICATED
LITTLE KEY WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED ABOUT HIM IN THE PURSE SUSPENDED TO
HIS SIDE A SOUND OF TAMBOURINE AND CASTANETS HAD REACHED HIS EAR
THESE
SOUNDS CAME FROM THE PLACE DU PARVIS
THE CELL AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID
HAD ONLY ONE WINDOW OPENING UPON THE REAR OF THE CHURCH
CLAUDE FROLLO
HAD HASTILY WITHDRAWN THE KEY AND AN INSTANT LATER HE WAS ON THE TOP
OF THE TOWER IN THE GLOOMY AND PENSIVE ATTITUDE IN WHICH THE MAIDENS
HAD SEEN HIM
THERE HE STOOD GRAVE MOTIONLESS ABSORBED IN ONE LOOK AND ONE THOUGHT
ALL PARIS LAY AT HIS FEET WITH THE THOUSAND SPIRES OF ITS EDIFICES AND
ITS CIRCULAR HORIZON OF GENTLE HILLS WITH ITS RIVER WINDING UNDER ITS
BRIDGES AND ITS PEOPLE MOVING TO AND FRO THROUGH ITS STREETS WITH
THE CLOUDS OF ITS SMOKE WITH THE MOUNTAINOUS CHAIN OF ITS ROOFS WHICH
PRESSES NOTRE DAME IN ITS DOUBLED FOLDS BUT OUT OF ALL THE CITY
THE ARCHDEACON GAZED AT ONE CORNER ONLY OF THE PAVEMENT THE PLACE DU
PARVIS IN ALL THAT THRONG AT BUT ONE FIGURE THE GYPSY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THIS LOOK
AND WHENCE PROCEEDED THE FLAME THAT FLASHED FROM IT
IT WAS A FIXED
GAZE WHICH WAS NEVERTHELESS FULL OF TROUBLE AND TUMULT
AND FROM THE
PROFOUND IMMOBILITY OF HIS WHOLE BODY BARELY AGITATED AT INTERVALS
BY AN INVOLUNTARY SHIVER AS A TREE IS MOVED BY THE WIND FROM THE
STIFFNESS OF HIS ELBOWS MORE MARBLE THAN THE BALUSTRADE ON WHICH
THEY LEANED OR THE SIGHT OF THE PETRIFIED SMILE WHICH CONTRACTED HIS
FACE ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT NOTHING LIVING WAS LEFT ABOUT CLAUDE
FROLLO EXCEPT HIS EYES
THE GYPSY WAS DANCING SHE WAS TWIRLING HER TAMBOURINE ON THE TIP OF HER
FINGER AND TOSSING IT INTO THE AIR AS SHE DANCED PROVENAL SARABANDS
AGILE LIGHT JOYOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FORMIDABLE GAZE WHICH
DESCENDED PERPENDICULARLY UPON HER HEAD
THE CROWD WAS SWARMING AROUND HER FROM TIME TO TIME A MAN ACCOUTRED IN
RED AND YELLOW MADE THEM FORM INTO A CIRCLE AND THEN RETURNED SEATED
HIMSELF ON A CHAIR A FEW PACES FROM THE DANCER AND TOOK THE GOAT'S HEAD
ON HIS KNEES
THIS MAN SEEMED TO BE THE GYPSY'S COMPANION
CLAUDE FROLLO
COULD NOT DISTINGUISH HIS FEATURES FROM HIS ELEVATED POST
FROM THE MOMENT WHEN THE ARCHDEACON CAUGHT SIGHT OF THIS STRANGER HIS
ATTENTION SEEMED DIVIDED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DANCER AND HIS FACE BECAME
MORE AND MORE GLOOMY
ALL AT ONCE HE ROSE UPRIGHT AND A QUIVER RAN
THROUGH HIS WHOLE BODY WHO IS THAT MAN HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS
TEETH I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN HER ALONE BEFORE
THEN HE PLUNGED DOWN BENEATH THE TORTUOUS VAULT OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE
AND ONCE MORE DESCENDED
AS HE PASSED THE DOOR OF THE BELL CHAMBER
WHICH WAS AJAR HE SAW SOMETHING WHICH STRUCK HIM HE BEHELD QUASIMODO
WHO LEANING THROUGH AN OPENING OF ONE OF THOSE SLATE PENTHOUSES WHICH
RESEMBLE ENORMOUS BLINDS APPEARED ALSO TO BE GAZING AT THE PLACE
HE
WAS ENGAGED IN SO PROFOUND A CONTEMPLATION THAT HE DID NOT NOTICE THE
PASSAGE OF HIS ADOPTED FATHER
HIS SAVAGE EYE HAD A SINGULAR EXPRESSION
IT WAS A CHARMED TENDER LOOK
THIS IS STRANGE MURMURED CLAUDE
IS
IT THE GYPSY AT WHOM HE IS THUS GAZING HE CONTINUED HIS DESCENT
AT
THE END OF A FEW MINUTES THE ANXIOUS ARCHDEACON ENTERED UPON THE PLACE
FROM THE DOOR AT THE BASE OF THE TOWER
WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE GYPSY GIRL HE SAID MINGLING WITH THE GROUP OF
SPECTATORS WHICH THE SOUND OF THE TAMBOURINE HAD COLLECTED
I KNOW NOT REPLIED ONE OF HIS NEIGHBORS I THINK THAT SHE HAS GONE
TO MAKE SOME OF HER FANDANGOES IN THE HOUSE OPPOSITE WHITHER THEY HAVE
CALLED HER
IN THE PLACE OF THE GYPSY ON THE CARPET WHOSE ARABESQUES HAD SEEMED TO
VANISH BUT A MOMENT PREVIOUSLY BY THE CAPRICIOUS FIGURES OF HER DANCE
THE ARCHDEACON NO LONGER BEHELD ANY ONE BUT THE RED AND YELLOW MAN
WHO IN ORDER TO EARN A FEW TESTERS IN HIS TURN WAS WALKING ROUND THE
CIRCLE WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS HIPS HIS HEAD THROWN BACK HIS FACE RED
HIS NECK OUTSTRETCHED WITH A CHAIR BETWEEN HIS TEETH
TO THE CHAIR HE
HAD FASTENED A CAT WHICH A NEIGHBOR HAD LENT AND WHICH WAS SPITTING IN
GREAT AFFRIGHT
NOTRE DAME EXCLAIMED THE ARCHDEACON AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE JUGGLER
PERSPIRING HEAVILY PASSED IN FRONT OF HIM WITH HIS PYRAMID OF CHAIR AND
HIS CAT WHAT IS MASTER PIERRE GRINGOIRE DOING HERE
THE HARSH VOICE OF THE ARCHDEACON THREW THE POOR FELLOW INTO SUCH A
COMMOTION THAT HE LOST HIS EQUILIBRIUM TOGETHER WITH HIS WHOLE EDIFICE
AND THE CHAIR AND THE CAT TUMBLED PELL MELL UPON THE HEADS OF THE
SPECTATORS IN THE MIDST OF INEXTINGUISHABLE HOOTINGS
IT IS PROBABLE THAT MASTER PIERRE GRINGOIRE FOR IT WAS INDEED HE WOULD
HAVE HAD A SORRY ACCOUNT TO SETTLE WITH THE NEIGHBOR WHO OWNED THE CAT
AND ALL THE BRUISED AND SCRATCHED FACES WHICH SURROUNDED HIM IF HE
HAD NOT HASTENED TO PROFIT BY THE TUMULT TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE CHURCH
WHITHER CLAUDE FROLLO HAD MADE HIM A SIGN TO FOLLOW HIM
THE CATHEDRAL WAS ALREADY DARK AND DESERTED THE SIDE AISLES WERE FULL
OF SHADOWS AND THE LAMPS OF THE CHAPELS BEGAN TO SHINE OUT LIKE STARS
SO BLACK HAD THE VAULTED CEILING BECOME
ONLY THE GREAT ROSE WINDOW OF
THE FAADE WHOSE THOUSAND COLORS WERE STEEPED IN A RAY OF HORIZONTAL
SUNLIGHT GLITTERED IN THE GLOOM LIKE A MASS OF DIAMONDS AND THREW ITS
DAZZLING REFLECTION TO THE OTHER END OF THE NAVE
WHEN THEY HAD ADVANCED A FEW PACES DOM CLAUDE PLACED HIS BACK AGAINST A
PILLAR AND GAZED INTENTLY AT GRINGOIRE
THE GAZE WAS NOT THE ONE WHICH
GRINGOIRE FEARED ASHAMED AS HE WAS OF HAVING BEEN CAUGHT BY A GRAVE AND
LEARNED PERSON IN THE COSTUME OF A BUFFOON
THERE WAS NOTHING MOCKING OR
IRONICAL IN THE PRIEST'S GLANCE IT WAS SERIOUS TRANQUIL PIERCING
THE
ARCHDEACON WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE
COME NOW MASTER PIERRE
YOU ARE TO EXPLAIN MANY THINGS TO ME
AND
FIRST OF ALL HOW COMES IT THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN FOR TWO MONTHS
AND THAT NOW ONE FINDS YOU IN THE PUBLIC SQUARES IN A FINE EQUIPMENT IN
TRUTH MOTLEY RED AND YELLOW LIKE A CAUDEBEC APPLE
MESSIRE SAID GRINGOIRE PITEOUSLY IT IS IN FACT AN AMAZING
ACCOUTREMENT
YOU SEE ME NO MORE COMFORTABLE IN IT THAN A CAT COIFFED
WITH A CALABASH
'TIS VERY ILL DONE I AM CONSCIOUS TO EXPOSE MESSIEURS
THE SERGEANTS OF THE WATCH TO THE LIABILITY OF CUDGELLING BENEATH THIS
CASSOCK THE HUMERUS OF A PYTHAGOREAN PHILOSOPHER
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE MY REVEREND MASTER 'TIS THE FAULT OF MY ANCIENT JERKIN WHICH
ABANDONED ME IN COWARDLY WISE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WINTER UNDER THE
PRETEXT THAT IT WAS FALLING INTO TATTERS AND THAT IT REQUIRED REPOSE IN
THE BASKET OF A RAG PICKER
WHAT IS ONE TO DO CIVILIZATION HAS NOT YET
ARRIVED AT THE POINT WHERE ONE CAN GO STARK NAKED AS ANCIENT DIOGENES
WISHED
ADD THAT A VERY COLD WIND WAS BLOWING AND 'TIS NOT IN THE MONTH
OF JANUARY THAT ONE CAN SUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPT TO MAKE HUMANITY TAKE
THIS NEW STEP
THIS GARMENT PRESENTED ITSELF I TOOK IT AND I LEFT MY
ANCIENT BLACK SMOCK WHICH FOR A HERMETIC LIKE MYSELF WAS FAR
FROM BEING HERMETICALLY CLOSED
BEHOLD ME THEN IN THE GARMENTS OF A
STAGE PLAYER LIKE SAINT GENEST
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE 'TIS AN ECLIPSE
APOLLO HIMSELF TENDED THE FLOCKS OF ADMETUS
'TIS A FINE PROFESSION THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED IN REPLIED THE
ARCHDEACON
I AGREE MY MASTER THAT 'TIS BETTER TO PHILOSOPHIZE AND POETIZE TO
BLOW THE FLAME IN THE FURNACE OR TO RECEIVE IT FROM CARRY CATS ON A
SHIELD
SO WHEN YOU ADDRESSED ME I WAS AS FOOLISH AS AN ASS BEFORE A
TURNSPIT
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE MESSIRE ONE MUST EAT EVERY DAY AND
THE FINEST ALEXANDRINE VERSES ARE NOT WORTH A BIT OF BRIE CHEESE
NOW I
MADE FOR MADAME MARGUERITE OF FLANDERS THAT FAMOUS EPITHALAMIUM AS YOU
KNOW AND THE CITY WILL NOT PAY ME UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT IT WAS NOT
EXCELLENT AS THOUGH ONE COULD GIVE A TRAGEDY OF SOPHOCLES FOR FOUR
CROWNS HENCE I WAS ON THE POINT OF DYING WITH HUNGER
HAPPILY I FOUND
THAT I WAS RATHER STRONG IN THE JAW SO I SAID TO THIS JAW PERFORM
SOME FEATS OF STRENGTH AND OF EQUILIBRIUM NOURISH THYSELF
ALE TE
IPSAM
A PACK OF BEGGARS WHO HAVE BECOME MY GOOD FRIENDS HAVE TAUGHT
ME TWENTY SORTS OF HERCULEAN FEATS AND NOW I GIVE TO MY TEETH EVERY
EVENING THE BREAD WHICH THEY HAVE EARNED DURING THE DAY BY THE SWEAT OF
MY BROW
AFTER ALL CONCEDE I GRANT THAT IT IS A SAD EMPLOYMENT FOR
MY INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES AND THAT MAN IS NOT MADE TO PASS HIS LIFE IN
BEATING THE TAMBOURINE AND BITING CHAIRS
BUT REVEREND MASTER IT IS
NOT SUFFICIENT TO PASS ONE'S LIFE ONE MUST EARN THE MEANS FOR LIFE
DOM CLAUDE LISTENED IN SILENCE
ALL AT ONCE HIS DEEP SET EYE ASSUMED SO
SAGACIOUS AND PENETRATING AN EXPRESSION THAT GRINGOIRE FELT HIMSELF SO
TO SPEAK SEARCHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SOUL BY THAT GLANCE
VERY GOOD MASTER PIERRE BUT HOW COMES IT THAT YOU ARE NOW IN COMPANY
WITH THAT GYPSY DANCER
IN FAITH SAID GRINGOIRE 'TIS BECAUSE SHE IS MY WIFE AND I AM HER
HUSBAND
THE PRIEST'S GLOOMY EYES FLASHED INTO FLAME
HAVE YOU DONE THAT YOU WRETCH HE CRIED SEIZING GRINGOIRE'S ARM WITH
FURY HAVE YOU BEEN SO ABANDONED BY GOD AS TO RAISE YOUR HAND AGAINST
THAT GIRL
ON MY CHANCE OF PARADISE MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED GRINGOIRE TREMBLING
IN EVERY LIMB I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I HAVE NEVER TOUCHED HER IF THAT IS
WHAT DISTURBS YOU
THEN WHY DO YOU TALK OF HUSBAND AND WIFE SAID THE PRIEST
GRINGOIRE
MADE HASTE TO RELATE TO HIM AS SUCCINCTLY AS POSSIBLE ALL THAT THE
READER ALREADY KNOWS HIS ADVENTURE IN THE COURT OF MIRACLES AND THE
BROKEN CROCK MARRIAGE
IT APPEARED MOREOVER THAT THIS MARRIAGE HAD LED
TO NO RESULTS WHATEVER AND THAT EACH EVENING THE GYPSY GIRL CHEATED
HIM OF HIS NUPTIAL RIGHT AS ON THE FIRST DAY
'TIS A MORTIFICATION
HE SAID IN CONCLUSION BUT THAT IS BECAUSE I HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO
WED A VIRGIN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DEMANDED THE ARCHDEACON WHO HAD BEEN GRADUALLY
APPEASED BY THIS RECITAL
'TIS VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN REPLIED THE POET
IT IS A
SUPERSTITION
MY WIFE IS ACCORDING TO WHAT AN OLD THIEF WHO IS CALLED
AMONG US THE DUKE OF EGYPT HAS TOLD ME A FOUNDLING OR A LOST CHILD
WHICH IS THE SAME THING
SHE WEARS ON HER NECK AN AMULET WHICH IT IS
AFFIRMED WILL CAUSE HER TO MEET HER PARENTS SOME DAY BUT WHICH WILL
LOSE ITS VIRTUE IF THE YOUNG GIRL LOSES HERS
HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT BOTH
OF US REMAIN VERY VIRTUOUS
SO RESUMED CLAUDE WHOSE BROW CLEARED MORE AND MORE YOU BELIEVE
MASTER PIERRE THAT THIS CREATURE HAS NOT BEEN APPROACHED BY ANY MAN
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE A MAN DO DOM CLAUDE AS AGAINST A SUPERSTITION
SHE HAS GOT THAT IN HER HEAD
I ASSUREDLY ESTEEM AS A RARITY THIS
NUNLIKE PRUDERY WHICH IS PRESERVED UNTAMED AMID THOSE BOHEMIAN GIRLS
WHO ARE SO EASILY BROUGHT INTO SUBJECTION
BUT SHE HAS THREE THINGS TO
PROTECT HER THE DUKE OF EGYPT WHO HAS TAKEN HER UNDER HIS SAFEGUARD
RECKONING PERCHANCE ON SELLING HER TO SOME GAY ABB ALL HIS TRIBE
WHO HOLD HER IN SINGULAR VENERATION LIKE A NOTRE DAME AND A CERTAIN
TINY POIGNARD WHICH THE BUXOM DAME ALWAYS WEARS ABOUT HER IN SOME
NOOK IN SPITE OF THE ORDINANCES OF THE PROVOST AND WHICH ONE CAUSES TO
FLY OUT INTO HER HANDS BY SQUEEZING HER WAIST
'TIS A PROUD WASP I CAN
TELL YOU
THE ARCHDEACON PRESSED GRINGOIRE WITH QUESTIONS
LA ESMERALDA IN THE JUDGMENT OF GRINGOIRE WAS AN INOFFENSIVE AND
CHARMING CREATURE PRETTY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A POUT WHICH WAS
PECULIAR TO HER A NAVE AND PASSIONATE DAMSEL IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING
AND ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT EVERYTHING NOT YET AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN EVEN IN HER DREAMS MADE LIKE THAT WILD
ESPECIALLY OVER DANCING NOISE THE OPEN AIR A SORT OF WOMAN BEE WITH
INVISIBLE WINGS ON HER FEET AND LIVING IN A WHIRLWIND
SHE OWED THIS
NATURE TO THE WANDERING LIFE WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS LED
GRINGOIRE HAD
SUCCEEDED IN LEARNING THAT WHILE A MERE CHILD SHE HAD TRAVERSED SPAIN
AND CATALONIA EVEN TO SICILY HE BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD EVEN BEEN TAKEN
BY THE CARAVAN OF ZINGARI OF WHICH SHE FORMED A PART TO THE KINGDOM
OF ALGIERS A COUNTRY SITUATED IN ACHAIA WHICH COUNTRY ADJOINS ON ONE
SIDE ALBANIA AND GREECE ON THE OTHER THE SICILIAN SEA WHICH IS THE
ROAD TO CONSTANTINOPLE
THE BOHEMIANS SAID GRINGOIRE WERE VASSALS OF
THE KING OF ALGIERS IN HIS QUALITY OF CHIEF OF THE WHITE MOORS
ONE
THING IS CERTAIN THAT LA ESMERALDA HAD COME TO FRANCE WHILE STILL VERY
YOUNG BY WAY OF HUNGARY
FROM ALL THESE COUNTRIES THE YOUNG GIRL HAD
BROUGHT BACK FRAGMENTS OF QUEER JARGONS SONGS AND STRANGE IDEAS WHICH
MADE HER LANGUAGE AS MOTLEY AS HER COSTUME HALF PARISIAN HALF AFRICAN
HOWEVER THE PEOPLE OF THE QUARTERS WHICH SHE FREQUENTED LOVED HER FOR
HER GAYETY HER DAINTINESS HER LIVELY MANNERS HER DANCES AND HER
SONGS
SHE BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE HATED IN ALL THE CITY BY BUT TWO
PERSONS OF WHOM SHE OFTEN SPOKE IN TERROR THE SACKED NUN OF THE
TOUR ROLAND A VILLANOUS RECLUSE WHO CHERISHED SOME SECRET GRUDGE
AGAINST THESE GYPSIES AND WHO CURSED THE POOR DANCER EVERY TIME THAT
THE LATTER PASSED BEFORE HER WINDOW AND A PRIEST WHO NEVER MET HER
WITHOUT CASTING AT HER LOOKS AND WORDS WHICH FRIGHTENED HER
THE MENTION OF THIS LAST CIRCUMSTANCE DISTURBED THE ARCHDEACON GREATLY
THOUGH GRINGOIRE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIS PERTURBATION TO SUCH AN
EXTENT HAD TWO MONTHS SUFFICED TO CAUSE THE HEEDLESS POET TO FORGET THE
SINGULAR DETAILS OF THE EVENING ON WHICH HE HAD MET THE GYPSY AND
THE PRESENCE OF THE ARCHDEACON IN IT ALL
OTHERWISE THE LITTLE DANCER
FEARED NOTHING SHE DID NOT TELL FORTUNES WHICH PROTECTED HER AGAINST
THOSE TRIALS FOR MAGIC WHICH WERE SO FREQUENTLY INSTITUTED AGAINST GYPSY
WOMEN
AND THEN GRINGOIRE HELD THE POSITION OF HER BROTHER IF NOT OF
HER HUSBAND
AFTER ALL THE PHILOSOPHER ENDURED THIS SORT OF PLATONIC
MARRIAGE VERY PATIENTLY
IT MEANT A SHELTER AND BREAD AT LEAST
EVERY
MORNING HE SET OUT FROM THE LAIR OF THE THIEVES GENERALLY WITH THE
GYPSY HE HELPED HER MAKE HER COLLECTIONS OF TARGES AND LITTLE BLANKS
IN THE SQUARES EACH EVENING HE RETURNED TO THE SAME ROOF WITH HER
ALLOWED HER TO BOLT HERSELF INTO HER LITTLE CHAMBER AND SLEPT THE SLEEP
OF THE JUST
A VERY SWEET EXISTENCE TAKING IT ALL IN ALL HE SAID
AND WELL ADAPTED TO REVERY
AND THEN ON HIS SOUL AND CONSCIENCE THE
PHILOSOPHER WAS NOT VERY SURE THAT HE WAS MADLY IN LOVE WITH THE GYPSY
HE LOVED HER GOAT ALMOST AS DEARLY
IT WAS A CHARMING ANIMAL GENTLE
INTELLIGENT CLEVER A LEARNED GOAT
NOTHING WAS MORE COMMON IN THE
MIDDLE AGES THAN THESE LEARNED ANIMALS WHICH AMAZED PEOPLE GREATLY AND
OFTEN LED THEIR INSTRUCTORS TO THE STAKE
BUT THE WITCHCRAFT OF THE GOAT
WITH THE GOLDEN HOOFS WAS A VERY INNOCENT SPECIES OF MAGIC
GRINGOIRE
EXPLAINED THEM TO THE ARCHDEACON WHOM THESE DETAILS SEEMED TO INTEREST
DEEPLY
IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO PRESENT THE
TAMBOURINE TO THE GOAT IN SUCH OR SUCH A MANNER IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FROM
HIM THE TRICK DESIRED
HE HAD BEEN TRAINED TO THIS BY THE GYPSY WHO
POSSESSED IN THESE DELICATE ARTS SO RARE A TALENT THAT TWO MONTHS
HAD SUFFICED TO TEACH THE GOAT TO WRITE WITH MOVABLE LETTERS THE WORD
PHOEBUS
AN ANCIENT BURGUNDIAN COIN
AN ANCIENT FRENCH COIN
'PHOEBUS SAID THE PRIEST WHY 'PHOEBUS'
I KNOW NOT REPLIED GRINGOIRE
PERHAPS IT IS A WORD WHICH SHE
BELIEVES TO BE ENDOWED WITH SOME MAGIC AND SECRET VIRTUE
SHE OFTEN
REPEATS IT IN A LOW TONE WHEN SHE THINKS THAT SHE IS ALONE
ARE YOU SURE PERSISTED CLAUDE WITH HIS PENETRATING GLANCE THAT IT
IS ONLY A WORD AND NOT A NAME
THE NAME OF WHOM SAID THE POET
HOW SHOULD I KNOW SAID THE PRIEST
THIS IS WHAT I IMAGINE MESSIRE
THESE BOHEMIANS ARE SOMETHING LIKE
GUEBRS AND ADORE THE SUN
HENCE PHOEBUS
THAT DOES NOT SEEM SO CLEAR TO ME AS TO YOU MASTER PIERRE
AFTER ALL THAT DOES NOT CONCERN ME
LET HER MUMBLE HER PHOEBUS AT HER
PLEASURE
ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT DJALI LOVES ME ALMOST AS MUCH AS HE
DOES HER
WHO IS DJALI
THE GOAT
THE ARCHDEACON DROPPED HIS CHIN INTO HIS HAND AND APPEARED TO REFLECT
FOR A MOMENT
ALL AT ONCE HE TURNED ABRUPTLY TO GRINGOIRE ONCE MORE
AND DO YOU SWEAR TO ME THAT YOU HAVE NOT TOUCHED HER
WHOM SAID GRINGOIRE THE GOAT
NO THAT WOMAN
MY WIFE I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I HAVE NOT
YOU ARE OFTEN ALONE WITH HER
A GOOD HOUR EVERY EVENING
PORN CLAUDE FROWNED
OH OH SOLUS CUM SOLA NON COGITABUNTUR ORARE PATER NOSTER
UPON MY SOUL I COULD SAY THE PATER AND THE AVE MARIA AND
THE CREDO IN DEUM PATREM OMNIPOTENTEM WITHOUT HER PAYING ANY MORE
ATTENTION TO ME THAN A CHICKEN TO A CHURCH
SWEAR TO ME BY THE BODY OF YOUR MOTHER REPEATED THE ARCHDEACON
VIOLENTLY THAT YOU HAVE NOT TOUCHED THAT CREATURE WITH EVEN THE TIP OF
YOUR FINGER
I WILL ALSO SWEAR IT BY THE HEAD OF MY FATHER FOR THE TWO THINGS
HAVE MORE AFFINITY BETWEEN THEM
BUT MY REVEREND MASTER PERMIT ME A
QUESTION IN MY TURN
SPEAK SIR
WHAT CONCERN IS IT OF YOURS
THE ARCHDEACON'S PALE FACE BECAME AS CRIMSON AS THE CHEEK OF A YOUNG
GIRL
HE REMAINED FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT ANSWERING THEN WITH VISIBLE
EMBARRASSMENT
LISTEN MASTER PIERRE GRINGOIRE
YOU ARE NOT YET DAMNED SO FAR AS
I KNOW
I TAKE AN INTEREST IN YOU AND WISH YOU WELL
NOW THE LEAST
CONTACT WITH THAT EGYPTIAN OF THE DEMON WOULD MAKE YOU THE VASSAL OF
SATAN
YOU KNOW THAT 'TIS ALWAYS THE BODY WHICH RUINS THE SOUL
WOE TO
YOU IF YOU APPROACH THAT WOMAN THAT IS ALL
I TRIED ONCE SAID GRINGOIRE SCRATCHING HIS EAR IT WAS THE FIRST
DAY BUT I GOT STUNG
YOU WERE SO AUDACIOUS MASTER PIERRE AND THE PRIEST'S BROW CLOUDED
OVER AGAIN
ON ANOTHER OCCASION CONTINUED THE POET WITH A SMILE I PEEPED
THROUGH THE KEYHOLE BEFORE GOING TO BED AND I BEHELD THE MOST
DELICIOUS DAME IN HER SHIFT THAT EVER MADE A BED CREAK UNDER HER BARE
FOOT
GO TO THE DEVIL CRIED THE PRIEST WITH A TERRIBLE LOOK AND GIVING
THE AMAZED GRINGOIRE A PUSH ON THE SHOULDERS HE PLUNGED WITH LONG
STRIDES UNDER THE GLOOMIEST ARCADES OF THE CATHEDRAL
CHAPTER III
THE BELLS
AFTER THE MORNING IN THE PILLORY THE NEIGHBORS OF NOTRE DAME THOUGHT
THEY NOTICED THAT QUASIMODO'S ARDOR FOR RINGING HAD GROWN COOL
FORMERLY THERE HAD BEEN PEALS FOR EVERY OCCASION LONG MORNING
SERENADES WHICH LASTED FROM PRIME TO COMPLINE PEALS FROM THE BELFRY
FOR A HIGH MASS RICH SCALES DRAWN OVER THE SMALLER BELLS FOR A WEDDING
FOR A CHRISTENING AND MINGLING IN THE AIR LIKE A RICH EMBROIDERY OF ALL
SORTS OF CHARMING SOUNDS
THE OLD CHURCH ALL VIBRATING AND SONOROUS
WAS IN A PERPETUAL JOY OF BELLS
ONE WAS CONSTANTLY CONSCIOUS OF THE
PRESENCE OF A SPIRIT OF NOISE AND CAPRICE WHO SANG THROUGH ALL THOSE
MOUTHS OF BRASS
NOW THAT SPIRIT SEEMED TO HAVE DEPARTED THE CATHEDRAL
SEEMED GLOOMY AND GLADLY REMAINED SILENT FESTIVALS AND FUNERALS HAD
THE SIMPLE PEAL DRY AND BARE DEMANDED BY THE RITUAL NOTHING MORE
OF
THE DOUBLE NOISE WHICH CONSTITUTES A CHURCH THE ORGAN WITHIN THE BELL
WITHOUT THE ORGAN ALONE REMAINED
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THERE WAS
NO LONGER A MUSICIAN IN THE BELFRY
QUASIMODO WAS ALWAYS THERE
NEVERTHELESS WHAT THEN HAD HAPPENED TO HIM WAS IT THAT THE SHAME AND
DESPAIR OF THE PILLORY STILL LINGERED IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART THAT
THE LASHES OF HIS TORMENTOR'S WHIP REVERBERATED UNENDINGLY IN HIS SOUL
AND THAT THE SADNESS OF SUCH TREATMENT HAD WHOLLY EXTINGUISHED IN HIM
EVEN HIS PASSION FOR THE BELLS OR WAS IT THAT MARIE HAD A RIVAL IN THE
HEART OF THE BELLRINGER OF NOTRE DAME AND THAT THE GREAT BELL AND HER
FOURTEEN SISTERS WERE NEGLECTED FOR SOMETHING MORE AMIABLE AND MORE
BEAUTIFUL
IT CHANCED THAT IN THE YEAR OF GRACE 1482 ANNUNCIATION DAY FELL ON
TUESDAY THE TWENTY FIFTH OF MARCH
THAT DAY THE AIR WAS SO PURE AND
LIGHT THAT QUASIMODO FELT SOME RETURNING AFFECTION FOR HIS BELLS
HE
THEREFORE ASCENDED THE NORTHERN TOWER WHILE THE BEADLE BELOW WAS OPENING
WIDE THE DOORS OF THE CHURCH WHICH WERE THEN ENORMOUS PANELS OF STOUT
WOOD COVERED WITH LEATHER BORDERED WITH NAILS OF GILDED IRON AND
FRAMED IN CARVINGS VERY ARTISTICALLY ELABORATED
ON ARRIVING IN THE LOFTY BELL CHAMBER QUASIMODO GAZED FOR SOME TIME
AT THE SIX BELLS AND SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY AS THOUGH GROANING OVER SOME
FOREIGN ELEMENT WHICH HAD INTERPOSED ITSELF IN HIS HEART BETWEEN THEM
AND HIM
BUT WHEN HE HAD SET THEM TO SWINGING WHEN HE FELT THAT CLUSTER
OF BELLS MOVING UNDER HIS HAND WHEN HE SAW FOR HE DID NOT HEAR IT THE
PALPITATING OCTAVE ASCEND AND DESCEND THAT SONOROUS SCALE LIKE A BIRD
HOPPING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH WHEN THE DEMON MUSIC THAT DEMON WHO
SHAKES A SPARKLING BUNDLE OF STRETTE TRILLS AND ARPEGGIOS HAD TAKEN
POSSESSION OF THE POOR DEAF MAN HE BECAME HAPPY ONCE MORE HE FORGOT
EVERYTHING AND HIS HEART EXPANDING MADE HIS FACE BEAM
HE WENT AND CAME HE BEAT HIS HANDS TOGETHER HE RAN FROM ROPE TO ROPE
HE ANIMATED THE SIX SINGERS WITH VOICE AND GESTURE LIKE THE LEADER OF
AN ORCHESTRA WHO IS URGING ON INTELLIGENT MUSICIANS
GO ON SAID HE GO ON GO ON GABRIELLE POUR OUT ALL THY NOISE
INTO THE PLACE 'TIS A FESTIVAL TO DAY
NO LAZINESS THIBAULD THOU ART
RELAXING GO ON GO ON THEN ART THOU RUSTED THOU SLUGGARD THAT IS
WELL QUICK QUICK LET NOT THY CLAPPER BE SEEN MAKE THEM ALL DEAF LIKE
ME
THAT'S IT THIBAULD BRAVELY DONE GUILLAUME GUILLAUME THOU ART
THE LARGEST AND PASQUIER IS THE SMALLEST AND PASQUIER DOES BEST
LET
US WAGER THAT THOSE WHO HEAR HIM WILL UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER THAN THEY
UNDERSTAND THEE
GOOD GOOD MY GABRIELLE STOUTLY MORE STOUTLY ELI
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP ALOFT THERE YOU TWO MOINEAUX SPARROWS I DO NOT
SEE YOU MAKING THE LEAST LITTLE SHRED OF NOISE
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF
THOSE BEAKS OF COPPER WHICH SEEM TO BE GAPING WHEN THEY SHOULD SING
COME WORK NOW 'TIS THE FEAST OF THE ANNUNCIATION
THE SUN IS FINE THE
CHIME MUST BE FINE ALSO
POOR GUILLAUME THOU ART ALL OUT OF BREATH MY
BIG FELLOW
HE WAS WHOLLY ABSORBED IN SPURRING ON HIS BELLS ALL SIX OF WHICH VIED
WITH EACH OTHER IN LEAPING AND SHAKING THEIR SHINING HAUNCHES LIKE
A NOISY TEAM OF SPANISH MULES PRICKED ON HERE AND THERE BY THE
APOSTROPHES OF THE MULETEER
ALL AT ONCE ON LETTING HIS GLANCE FALL BETWEEN THE LARGE SLATE SCALES
WHICH COVER THE PERPENDICULAR WALL OF THE BELL TOWER AT A CERTAIN
HEIGHT HE BEHELD ON THE SQUARE A YOUNG GIRL FANTASTICALLY DRESSED
STOP SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND A CARPET ON WHICH A SMALL GOAT TOOK
UP ITS POST AND A GROUP OF SPECTATORS COLLECT AROUND HER
THIS SIGHT
SUDDENLY CHANGED THE COURSE OF HIS IDEAS AND CONGEALED HIS ENTHUSIASM
AS A BREATH OF AIR CONGEALS MELTED ROSIN
HE HALTED TURNED HIS BACK TO
THE BELLS AND CROUCHED DOWN BEHIND THE PROJECTING ROOF OF SLATE FIXING
UPON THE DANCER THAT DREAMY SWEET AND TENDER LOOK WHICH HAD ALREADY
ASTONISHED THE ARCHDEACON ON ONE OCCASION
MEANWHILE THE FORGOTTEN
BELLS DIED AWAY ABRUPTLY AND ALL TOGETHER TO THE GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
OF THE LOVERS OF BELL RINGING WHO WERE LISTENING IN GOOD FAITH TO THE
PEAL FROM ABOVE THE PONT DU CHANGE AND WHO WENT AWAY DUMBFOUNDED LIKE
A DOG WHO HAS BEEN OFFERED A BONE AND GIVEN A STONE
CHAPTER IV
ANARKH
IT CHANCED THAT UPON A FINE MORNING IN THIS SAME MONTH OF MARCH I THINK
IT WAS ON SATURDAY THE 29TH SAINT EUSTACHE'S DAY OUR YOUNG FRIEND THE
STUDENT JEHAN FROLLO DU MOULIN PERCEIVED AS HE WAS DRESSING HIMSELF
THAT HIS BREECHES WHICH CONTAINED HIS PURSE GAVE OUT NO METALLIC RING
POOR PURSE HE SAID DRAWING IT FROM HIS FOB WHAT NOT THE SMALLEST
PARISIS HOW CRUELLY THE DICE BEER POTS AND VENUS HAVE DEPLETED THEE
HOW EMPTY WRINKLED LIMP THOU ART THOU RESEMBLEST THE THROAT OF A
FURY I ASK YOU MESSER CICERO AND MESSER SENECA COPIES OF WHOM ALL
DOG'S EARED I BEHOLD SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR WHAT PROFITS IT ME TO
KNOW BETTER THAN ANY GOVERNOR OF THE MINT OR ANY JEW ON THE PONT AUX
CHANGEURS THAT A GOLDEN CROWN STAMPED WITH A CROWN IS WORTH THIRTY FIVE
UNZAINS OF TWENTY FIVE SOUS AND EIGHT DENIERS PARISIS APIECE AND
THAT A CROWN STAMPED WITH A CRESCENT IS WORTH THIRTY SIX UNZAINS OF
TWENTY SIX SOUS SIX DENIERS TOURNOIS APIECE IF I HAVE NOT A SINGLE
WRETCHED BLACK LIARD TO RISK ON THE DOUBLE SIX OH CONSUL CICERO THIS
IS NO CALAMITY FROM WHICH ONE EXTRICATES ONE'S SELF WITH PERIPHRASES
QUEMADMODUM AND VERUM ENIM VERO
HE DRESSED HIMSELF SADLY
AN IDEA HAD OCCURRED TO HIM AS HE LACED HIS
BOOTS BUT HE REJECTED IT AT FIRST NEVERTHELESS IT RETURNED AND HE
PUT ON HIS WAISTCOAT WRONG SIDE OUT AN EVIDENT SIGN OF VIOLENT INTERNAL
COMBAT
AT LAST HE DASHED HIS CAP ROUGHLY ON THE FLOOR AND EXCLAIMED
SO MUCH THE WORSE LET COME OF IT WHAT MAY
I AM GOING TO MY BROTHER I
SHALL CATCH A SERMON BUT I SHALL CATCH A CROWN
THEN HE HASTILY DONNED HIS LONG JACKET WITH FURRED HALF SLEEVES PICKED
UP HIS CAP AND WENT OUT LIKE A MAN DRIVEN TO DESPERATION
HE DESCENDED THE RUE DE LA HARPE TOWARD THE CITY
AS HE PASSED THE
RUE DE LA HUCHETTE THE ODOR OF THOSE ADMIRABLE SPITS WHICH WERE
INCESSANTLY TURNING TICKLED HIS OLFACTORY APPARATUS AND HE BESTOWED
A LOVING GLANCE TOWARD THE CYCLOPEAN ROAST WHICH ONE DAY DREW FROM THE
FRANCISCAN FRIAR CALATAGIRONE THIS PATHETIC EXCLAMATION VERAMENTE
QUESTE ROTISSERIE SONO COSA STUPENDA BUT JEHAN HAD NOT THE
WHEREWITHAL TO BUY A BREAKFAST AND HE PLUNGED WITH A PROFOUND SIGH
UNDER THE GATEWAY OF THE PETIT CHTELET THAT ENORMOUS DOUBLE TREFOIL OF
MASSIVE TOWERS WHICH GUARDED THE ENTRANCE TO THE CITY
TRULY THESE ROASTINGS ARE A STUPENDOUS THING
HE DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO CAST A STONE IN PASSING AS WAS THE
USAGE AT THE MISERABLE STATUE OF THAT PRINET LECLERC WHO HAD DELIVERED
UP THE PARIS OF CHARLES VI
TO THE ENGLISH A CRIME WHICH HIS EFFIGY
ITS FACE BATTERED WITH STONES AND SOILED WITH MUD EXPIATED FOR THREE
CENTURIES AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DE LA HARPE AND THE RUE DE BUCI AS
IN AN ETERNAL PILLORY
THE PETIT PONT TRAVERSED THE RUE NEUVE SAINTE GENEVIVE CROSSED JEHAN
DE MOLENDINO FOUND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF NOTRE DAME
THEN INDECISION
SEIZED UPON HIM ONCE MORE AND HE PACED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ROUND THE
STATUE OF M
LEGRIS REPEATING TO HIMSELF WITH ANGUISH THE SERMON IS
SURE THE CROWN IS DOUBTFUL
HE STOPPED A BEADLE WHO EMERGED FROM THE CLOISTER WHERE IS MONSIEUR
THE ARCHDEACON OF JOSAS
I BELIEVE THAT HE IS IN HIS SECRET CELL IN THE TOWER SAID THE BEADLE
I SHOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO DISTURB HIM THERE UNLESS YOU COME FROM SOME
ONE LIKE THE POPE OR MONSIEUR THE KING
JEHAN CLAPPED HIS HANDS
BCLIABLE HERE'S A MAGNIFICENT CHANCE TO SEE THE FAMOUS SORCERY
CELL
THIS REFLECTION HAVING BROUGHT HIM TO A DECISION HE PLUNGED RESOLUTELY
INTO THE SMALL BLACK DOORWAY AND BEGAN THE ASCENT OF THE SPIRAL OF
SAINT GILLES WHICH LEADS TO THE UPPER STORIES OF THE TOWER
I AM
GOING TO SEE HE SAID TO HIMSELF ON THE WAY
BY THE RAVENS OF THE HOLY
VIRGIN IT MUST NEEDS BE A CURIOUS THING THAT CELL WHICH MY REVEREND
BROTHER HIDES SO SECRETLY 'TIS SAID THAT HE LIGHTS UP THE KITCHENS OF
HELL THERE AND THAT HE COOKS THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THERE OVER A HOT
FIRE
BDIEU I CARE NO MORE FOR THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THAN FOR A
PEBBLE AND I WOULD RATHER FIND OVER HIS FURNACE AN OMELETTE OF EASTER
EGGS AND BACON THAN THE BIGGEST PHILOSOPHER'S STONE IN THE WORLD
ON ARRIVING AT THE GALLERY OF SLENDER COLUMNS HE TOOK BREATH FOR A
MOMENT AND SWORE AGAINST THE INTERMINABLE STAIRCASE BY I KNOW NOT HOW
MANY MILLION CARTLOADS OF DEVILS THEN HE RESUMED HIS ASCENT THROUGH
THE NARROW DOOR OF THE NORTH TOWER NOW CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC
SEVERAL MOMENTS AFTER PASSING THE BELL CHAMBER HE CAME UPON A LITTLE
LANDING PLACE BUILT IN A LATERAL NICHE AND UNDER THE VAULT OF A LOW
POINTED DOOR WHOSE ENORMOUS LOCK AND STRONG IRON BARS HE WAS ENABLED
TO SEE THROUGH A LOOPHOLE PIERCED IN THE OPPOSITE CIRCULAR WALL OF THE
STAIRCASE
PERSONS DESIROUS OF VISITING THIS DOOR AT THE PRESENT DAY
WILL RECOGNIZE IT BY THIS INSCRIPTION ENGRAVED IN WHITE LETTERS ON THE
BLACK WALL J'ADORE CORALIE 1823
SIGNE UGENE SIGN STANDS IN THE
TEXT
UGH SAID THE SCHOLAR 'TIS HERE NO DOUBT
THE KEY WAS IN THE LOCK THE DOOR WAS VERY CLOSE TO HIM HE GAVE IT A
GENTLE PUSH AND THRUST HIS HEAD THROUGH THE OPENING
THE READER CANNOT HAVE FAILED TO TURN OVER THE ADMIRABLE WORKS OF
REMBRANDT THAT SHAKESPEARE OF PAINTING
AMID SO MANY MARVELLOUS
ENGRAVINGS THERE IS ONE ETCHING IN PARTICULAR WHICH IS SUPPOSED
TO REPRESENT DOCTOR FAUST AND WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE
WITHOUT BEING DAZZLED
IT REPRESENTS A GLOOMY CELL IN THE CENTRE IS A
TABLE LOADED WITH HIDEOUS OBJECTS SKULLS SPHERES ALEMBICS COMPASSES
HIEROGLYPHIC PARCHMENTS
THE DOCTOR IS BEFORE THIS TABLE CLAD IN HIS
LARGE COAT AND COVERED TO THE VERY EYEBROWS WITH HIS FURRED CAP
HE IS
VISIBLE ONLY TO HIS WAIST
HE HAS HALF RISEN FROM HIS IMMENSE ARM CHAIR
HIS CLENCHED FISTS REST ON THE TABLE AND HE IS GAZING WITH CURIOSITY
AND TERROR AT A LARGE LUMINOUS CIRCLE FORMED OF MAGIC LETTERS WHICH
GLEAMS FROM THE WALL BEYOND LIKE THE SOLAR SPECTRUM IN A DARK CHAMBER
THIS CABALISTIC SUN SEEMS TO TREMBLE BEFORE THE EYE AND FILLS THE WAN
CELL WITH ITS MYSTERIOUS RADIANCE
IT IS HORRIBLE AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL
SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO FAUST'S CELL PRESENTED ITSELF TO JEHAN'S VIEW
WHEN HE VENTURED HIS HEAD THROUGH THE HALF OPEN DOOR
IT ALSO WAS A
GLOOMY AND SPARSELY LIGHTED RETREAT
THERE ALSO STOOD A LARGE ARM CHAIR
AND A LARGE TABLE COMPASSES ALEMBICS SKELETONS OF ANIMALS SUSPENDED
FROM THE CEILING A GLOBE ROLLING ON THE FLOOR HIPPOCEPHALI MINGLED
PROMISCUOUSLY WITH DRINKING CUPS IN WHICH QUIVERED LEAVES OF GOLD
SKULLS PLACED UPON VELLUM CHECKERED WITH FIGURES AND CHARACTERS HUGE
MANUSCRIPTS PILED UP WIDE OPEN WITHOUT MERCY ON THE CRACKING CORNERS OF
THE PARCHMENT IN SHORT ALL THE RUBBISH OF SCIENCE AND EVERYWHERE
ON THIS CONFUSION DUST AND SPIDERS' WEBS BUT THERE WAS NO CIRCLE OF
LUMINOUS LETTERS NO DOCTOR IN AN ECSTASY CONTEMPLATING THE FLAMING
VISION AS THE EAGLE GAZES UPON THE SUN
NEVERTHELESS THE CELL WAS NOT DESERTED
A MAN WAS SEATED IN THE
ARM CHAIR AND BENDING OVER THE TABLE
JEHAN TO WHOM HIS BACK WAS
TURNED COULD SEE ONLY HIS SHOULDERS AND THE BACK OF HIS SKULL BUT
HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNIZING THAT BALD HEAD WHICH NATURE HAD
PROVIDED WITH AN ETERNAL TONSURE AS THOUGH DESIROUS OF MARKING BY THIS
EXTERNAL SYMBOL THE ARCHDEACON'S IRRESISTIBLE CLERICAL VOCATION
JEHAN ACCORDINGLY RECOGNIZED HIS BROTHER BUT THE DOOR HAD BEEN
OPENED SO SOFTLY THAT NOTHING WARNED DOM CLAUDE OF HIS PRESENCE
THE
INQUISITIVE SCHOLAR TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO EXAMINE THE
CELL FOR A FEW MOMENTS AT HIS LEISURE
A LARGE FURNACE WHICH HE HAD
NOT AT FIRST OBSERVED STOOD TO THE LEFT OF THE ARM CHAIR BENEATH THE
WINDOW
THE RAY OF LIGHT WHICH PENETRATED THROUGH THIS APERTURE MADE
ITS WAY THROUGH A SPIDER'S CIRCULAR WEB WHICH TASTEFULLY INSCRIBED ITS
DELICATE ROSE IN THE ARCH OF THE WINDOW AND IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH THE
INSECT ARCHITECT HUNG MOTIONLESS LIKE THE HUB OF THIS WHEEL OF LACE
UPON THE FURNACE WERE ACCUMULATED IN DISORDER ALL SORTS OF VASES
EARTHENWARE BOTTLES GLASS RETORTS AND MATTRESSES OF CHARCOAL
JEHAN
OBSERVED WITH A SIGH THAT THERE WAS NO FRYING PAN
HOW COLD THE
KITCHEN UTENSILS ARE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
IN FACT THERE WAS NO FIRE IN THE FURNACE AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH NONE
HAD BEEN LIGHTED FOR A LONG TIME
A GLASS MASK WHICH JEHAN NOTICED
AMONG THE UTENSILS OF ALCHEMY AND WHICH SERVED NO DOUBT TO PROTECT THE
ARCHDEACON'S FACE WHEN HE WAS WORKING OVER SOME SUBSTANCE TO BE DREADED
LAY IN ONE CORNER COVERED WITH DUST AND APPARENTLY FORGOTTEN
BESIDE IT
LAY A PAIR OF BELLOWS NO LESS DUSTY THE UPPER SIDE OF WHICH BORE THIS
INSCRIPTION INCRUSTED IN COPPER LETTERS SPIRA SPERA
OTHER INSCRIPTIONS WERE WRITTEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FASHION OF THE
HERMETICS IN GREAT NUMBERS ON THE WALLS SOME TRACED WITH INK OTHERS
ENGRAVED WITH A METAL POINT
THERE WERE MOREOVER GOTHIC LETTERS
HEBREW LETTERS GREEK LETTERS AND ROMAN LETTERS PELL MELL THE
INSCRIPTIONS OVERFLOWED AT HAPHAZARD ON TOP OF EACH OTHER THE MORE
RECENT EFFACING THE MORE ANCIENT AND ALL ENTANGLED WITH EACH OTHER
LIKE THE BRANCHES IN A THICKET LIKE PIKES IN AN AFFRAY
IT WAS IN
FACT A STRANGELY CONFUSED MINGLING OF ALL HUMAN PHILOSOPHIES ALL
REVERIES ALL HUMAN WISDOM
HERE AND THERE ONE SHONE OUT FROM AMONG THE
REST LIKE A BANNER AMONG LANCE HEADS
GENERALLY IT WAS A BRIEF GREEK
OR ROMAN DEVICE SUCH AS THE MIDDLE AGES KNEW SO WELL HOW TO
FORMULATE UNDE INDE HOMO HOMINI MONSTRURN AST'RA CASTRA NOMEN
NUMEN MEYA BIBKLOV UEYA XAXOV SAPERE AUDE
FIAT UBI VULT ETC
SOMETIMES A WORD DEVOID OF ALL APPARENT SENSE AVAYXOQPAYIA WHICH
POSSIBLY CONTAINED A BITTER ALLUSION TO THE REGIME OF THE CLOISTER
SOMETIMES A SIMPLE MAXIM OF CLERICAL DISCIPLINE FORMULATED IN A REGULAR
HEXAMETER COELESTEM DOMINUM TERRESTREM DICITE DOMINUM
THERE WAS
ALSO HEBREW JARGON OF WHICH JEHAN WHO AS YET KNEW BUT LITTLE GREEK
UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AND ALL WERE TRAVERSED IN EVERY DIRECTION BY STARS
BY FIGURES OF MEN OR ANIMALS AND BY INTERSECTING TRIANGLES AND THIS
CONTRIBUTED NOT A LITTLE TO MAKE THE SCRAWLED WALL OF THE CELL RESEMBLE
A SHEET OF PAPER OVER WHICH A MONKEY HAD DRAWN BACK AND FORTH A PEN
FILLED WITH INK
THE WHOLE CHAMBER MOREOVER PRESENTED A GENERAL ASPECT OF ABANDONMENT
AND DILAPIDATION AND THE BAD STATE OF THE UTENSILS INDUCED THE
SUPPOSITION THAT THEIR OWNER HAD LONG BEEN DISTRACTED FROM HIS LABORS
BY OTHER PREOCCUPATIONS
MEANWHILE THIS MASTER BENT OVER A VAST
MANUSCRIPT ORNAMENTED WITH FANTASTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS APPEARED TO BE
TORMENTED BY AN IDEA WHICH INCESSANTLY MINGLED WITH HIS MEDITATIONS
THAT AT LEAST WAS JEHAN'S IDEA WHEN HE HEARD HIM EXCLAIM WITH THE
THOUGHTFUL BREAKS OF A DREAMER THINKING ALOUD
YES MANOU SAID IT AND ZOROASTER TAUGHT IT THE SUN IS BORN FROM FIRE
THE MOON FROM THE SUN FIRE IS THE SOUL OF THE UNIVERSE ITS ELEMENTARY
ATOMS POUR FORTH AND FLOW INCESSANTLY UPON THE WORLD THROUGH INFINITE
CHANNELS AT THE POINT WHERE THESE CURRENTS INTERSECT EACH OTHER IN THE
HEAVENS THEY PRODUCE LIGHT AT THEIR POINTS OF INTERSECTION ON EARTH
THEY PRODUCE GOLD
LIGHT GOLD THE SAME THING FROM FIRE TO THE
CONCRETE STATE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VISIBLE AND THE PALPABLE
BETWEEN THE FLUID AND THE SOLID IN THE SAME SUBSTANCE BETWEEN WATER AND
ICE NOTHING MORE
THESE ARE NO DREAMS IT IS THE GENERAL LAW OF NATURE
BUT WHAT IS ONE TO DO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM SCIENCE THE SECRET OF
THIS GENERAL LAW WHAT THIS LIGHT WHICH INUNDATES MY HAND IS GOLD
THESE SAME ATOMS DILATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH A CERTAIN LAW NEED ONLY BE
CONDENSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANOTHER LAW
HOW IS IT TO BE DONE
SOME HAVE FANCIED BY BURYING A RAY OF SUNLIGHT AVERROS YES 'TIS
AVERROS AVERROS BURIED ONE UNDER THE FIRST PILLAR ON THE LEFT OF THE
SANCTUARY OF THE KORAN IN THE GREAT MAHOMETAN MOSQUE OF CORDOVA BUT
THE VAULT CANNOT BE OPENED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE
OPERATION HAS SUCCEEDED UNTIL AFTER THE LAPSE OF EIGHT THOUSAND YEARS
THE DEVIL SAID JEHAN TO HIMSELF 'TIS A LONG WHILE TO WAIT FOR A
CROWN
OTHERS HAVE THOUGHT CONTINUED THE DREAMY ARCHDEACON THAT IT
WOULD BE BETTER WORTH WHILE TO OPERATE UPON A RAY OF SIRIUS
BUT 'TIS
EXCEEDING HARD TO OBTAIN THIS RAY PURE BECAUSE OF THE SIMULTANEOUS
PRESENCE OF OTHER STARS WHOSE RAYS MINGLE WITH IT
FLAMEL ESTEEMED
IT MORE SIMPLE TO OPERATE UPON TERRESTRIAL FIRE
FLAMEL THERE'S
PREDESTINATION IN THE NAME FLAMMA YES FIRE
ALL LIES THERE
THE
DIAMOND IS CONTAINED IN THE CARBON GOLD IS IN THE FIRE
BUT HOW TO
EXTRACT IT MAGISTRI AFFIRMS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN FEMININE NAMES
WHICH POSSESS A CHARM SO SWEET AND MYSTERIOUS THAT IT SUFFICES TO
PRONOUNCE THEM DURING THE OPERATION
LET US READ WHAT MANON SAYS ON THE
MATTER 'WHERE WOMEN ARE HONORED THE DIVINITIES ARE REJOICED WHERE
THEY ARE DESPISED IT IS USELESS TO PRAY TO GOD
THE MOUTH OF A WOMAN
IS CONSTANTLY PURE IT IS A RUNNING WATER IT IS A RAY OF SUNLIGHT
THE
NAME OF A WOMAN SHOULD BE AGREEABLE SWEET FANCIFUL IT SHOULD END IN
LONG VOWELS AND RESEMBLE WORDS OF BENEDICTION YES THE SAGE IS RIGHT
IN TRUTH MARIA SOPHIA LA ESMERAL DAMNATION ALWAYS THAT THOUGHT
AND HE CLOSED THE BOOK VIOLENTLY
HE PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS BROW AS THOUGH TO BRUSH AWAY THE IDEA WHICH
ASSAILED HIM THEN HE TOOK FROM THE TABLE A NAIL AND A SMALL HAMMER
WHOSE HANDLE WAS CURIOUSLY PAINTED WITH CABALISTIC LETTERS
FOR SOME TIME HE SAID WITH A BITTER SMILE I HAVE FAILED IN ALL MY
EXPERIMENTS ONE FIXED IDEA POSSESSES ME AND SEARS MY BRAIN LIKE FIRE
I HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF CASSIODORUS
WHOSE LAMP BURNED WITHOUT WICK AND WITHOUT OIL
A SIMPLE MATTER
NEVERTHELESS
THE DEUCE MUTTERED JEHAN IN HIS BEARD
HENCE CONTINUED THE PRIEST ONE WRETCHED THOUGHT IS SUFFICIENT TO
RENDER A MAN WEAK AND BESIDE HIMSELF OH HOW CLAUDE PERNELLE WOULD
LAUGH AT ME
SHE WHO COULD NOT TURN NICHOLAS FLAMEL ASIDE FOR ONE
MOMENT FROM HIS PURSUIT OF THE GREAT WORK WHAT I HOLD IN MY HAND THE
MAGIC HAMMER OF ZCHIL AT EVERY BLOW DEALT BY THE FORMIDABLE RABBI
FROM THE DEPTHS OF HIS CELL UPON THIS NAIL THAT ONE OF HIS ENEMIES
WHOM HE HAD CONDEMNED WERE HE A THOUSAND LEAGUES AWAY WAS BURIED A
CUBIT DEEP IN THE EARTH WHICH SWALLOWED HIM
THE KING OF FRANCE HIMSELF
IN CONSEQUENCE OF ONCE HAVING INCONSIDERATELY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE
THERMATURGIST SANK TO THE KNEES THROUGH THE PAVEMENT OF HIS OWN PARIS
THIS TOOK PLACE THREE CENTURIES AGO
WELL I POSSESS THE HAMMER AND THE
NAIL AND IN MY HANDS THEY ARE UTENSILS NO MORE FORMIDABLE THAN A CLUB
IN THE HANDS OF A MAKER OF EDGE TOOLS
AND YET ALL THAT IS REQUIRED
IS TO FIND THE MAGIC WORD WHICH ZCHIL PRONOUNCED WHEN HE STRUCK HIS
NAIL
WHAT NONSENSE THOUGHT JEHAN
LET US SEE LET US TRY RESUMED THE ARCHDEACON BRISKLY
WERE I TO
SUCCEED I SHOULD BEHOLD THE BLUE SPARK FLASH FROM THE HEAD OF THE NAIL
EMEN HTAN EMEN HTAN THAT'S NOT IT
SIGANI SIGANI MAY THIS NAIL
OPEN THE TOMB TO ANY ONE WHO BEARS THE NAME OF PHOEBUS A CURSE UPON IT
ALWAYS AND ETERNALLY THE SAME IDEA
AND HE FLUNG AWAY THE HAMMER IN A RAGE
THEN HE SANK DOWN SO DEEPLY ON
THE ARM CHAIR AND THE TABLE THAT JEHAN LOST HIM FROM VIEW BEHIND THE
GREAT PILE OF MANUSCRIPTS
FOR THE SPACE OF SEVERAL MINUTES ALL THAT HE
SAW WAS HIS FIST CONVULSIVELY CLENCHED ON A BOOK
SUDDENLY DOM CLAUDE
SPRANG UP SEIZED A COMPASS AND ENGRAVED IN SILENCE UPON THE WALL IN
CAPITAL LETTERS THIS GREEK WORD
ANARKH
MY BROTHER IS MAD SAID JEHAN TO HIMSELF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE
SIMPLE TO WRITE FATUM EVERY ONE IS NOT OBLIGED TO KNOW GREEK
THE ARCHDEACON RETURNED AND SEATED HIMSELF IN HIS ARMCHAIR AND PLACED
HIS HEAD ON BOTH HIS HANDS AS A SICK MAN DOES WHOSE HEAD IS HEAVY AND
BURNING
THE STUDENT WATCHED HIS BROTHER WITH SURPRISE
HE DID NOT KNOW HE WHO
WORE HIS HEART ON HIS SLEEVE HE WHO OBSERVED ONLY THE GOOD OLD LAW
OF NATURE IN THE WORLD HE WHO ALLOWED HIS PASSIONS TO FOLLOW THEIR
INCLINATIONS AND IN WHOM THE LAKE OF GREAT EMOTIONS WAS ALWAYS DRY SO
FREELY DID HE LET IT OFF EACH DAY BY FRESH DRAINS HE DID NOT KNOW WITH
WHAT FURY THE SEA OF HUMAN PASSIONS FERMENTS AND BOILS WHEN ALL EGRESS
IS DENIED TO IT HOW IT ACCUMULATES HOW IT SWELLS HOW IT OVERFLOWS
HOW IT HOLLOWS OUT THE HEART HOW IT BREAKS IN INWARD SOBS AND DULL
CONVULSIONS UNTIL IT HAS RENT ITS DIKES AND BURST ITS BED
THE AUSTERE
AND GLACIAL ENVELOPE OF CLAUDE FROLLO THAT COLD SURFACE OF STEEP AND
INACCESSIBLE VIRTUE HAD ALWAYS DECEIVED JEHAN
THE MERRY SCHOLAR HAD
NEVER DREAMED THAT THERE WAS BOILING LAVA FURIOUS AND PROFOUND BENEATH
THE SNOWY BROW OF AETNA
WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE SUDDENLY BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THESE THINGS
BUT GIDDY AS HE WAS HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD SEEN WHAT HE OUGHT NOT
TO HAVE SEEN THAT HE HAD JUST SURPRISED THE SOUL OF HIS ELDER BROTHER
IN ONE OF ITS MOST SECRET ALTITUDES AND THAT CLAUDE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED
TO KNOW IT
SEEING THAT THE ARCHDEACON HAD FALLEN BACK INTO HIS FORMER
IMMOBILITY HE WITHDREW HIS HEAD VERY SOFTLY AND MADE SOME NOISE WITH
HIS FEET OUTSIDE THE DOOR LIKE A PERSON WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED AND IS
GIVING WARNING OF HIS APPROACH
ENTER CRIED THE ARCHDEACON FROM THE INTERIOR OF HIS CELL I
WAS EXPECTING YOU
I LEFT THE DOOR UNLOCKED EXPRESSLY ENTER MASTER
JACQUES
THE SCHOLAR ENTERED BOLDLY
THE ARCHDEACON WHO WAS VERY MUCH
EMBARRASSED BY SUCH A VISIT IN SUCH A PLACE TREMBLED IN HIS ARM CHAIR
WHAT 'TIS YOU JEHAN
'TIS A J ALL THE SAME SAID THE SCHOLAR WITH HIS RUDDY MERRY AND
AUDACIOUS FACE
DOM CLAUDE'S VISAGE HAD RESUMED ITS SEVERE EXPRESSION
WHAT ARE YOU COME FOR
BROTHER REPLIED THE SCHOLAR MAKING AN EFFORT TO ASSUME A DECENT
PITIFUL AND MODEST MIEN AND TWIRLING HIS CAP IN HIS HANDS WITH AN
INNOCENT AIR I AM COME TO ASK OF YOU
WHAT
A LITTLE LECTURE ON MORALITY OF WHICH I STAND GREATLY IN NEED JEHAN
DID NOT DARE TO ADD ALOUD AND A LITTLE MONEY OF WHICH I AM IN STILL
GREATER NEED THIS LAST MEMBER OF HIS PHRASE REMAINED UNUTTERED
MONSIEUR SAID THE ARCHDEACON IN A COLD TONE I AM GREATLY
DISPLEASED WITH YOU
ALAS SIGHED THE SCHOLAR
DOM CLAUDE MADE HIS ARM CHAIR DESCRIBE A QUARTER CIRCLE AND GAZED
INTENTLY AT JEHAN
I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU
THIS WAS A FORMIDABLE EXORDIUM
JEHAN BRACED HIMSELF FOR A ROUGH
ENCOUNTER
JEHAN COMPLAINTS ARE BROUGHT ME ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY
WHAT AFFRAY WAS
THAT IN WHICH YOU BRUISED WITH A CUDGEL A LITTLE VICOMTE ALBERT DE
RAMONCHAMP
OH SAID JEHAN A VAST THING THAT A MALICIOUS PAGE AMUSED HIMSELF BY
SPLASHING THE SCHOLARS BY MAKING HIS HORSE GALLOP THROUGH THE MIRE
WHO PURSUED THE ARCHDEACON IS THAT MAHIET FARGEL WHOSE GOWN YOU
HAVE TORN TUNICAM DECHIRAVERUNT SAITH THE COMPLAINT
AH BAH A WRETCHED CAP OF A MONTAIGU ISN'T THAT IT
THE COMPLAINT SAYS TUNICAM AND NOT CAPPETTAM
DO YOU KNOW LATIN
JEHAN DID NOT REPLY
YES PURSUED THE PRIEST SHAKING HIS HEAD THAT IS THE STATE OF
LEARNING AND LETTERS AT THE PRESENT DAY
THE LATIN TONGUE IS HARDLY
UNDERSTOOD SYRIAC IS UNKNOWN GREEK SO ODIOUS THAT 'TIS ACCOUNTED NO
IGNORANCE IN THE MOST LEARNED TO SKIP A GREEK WORD WITHOUT READING IT
AND TO SAY GROECUM EST NON LEGITUR
THE SCHOLAR RAISED HIS EYES BOLDLY
MONSIEUR MY BROTHER DOTH IT PLEASE
YOU THAT I SHALL EXPLAIN IN GOOD FRENCH VERNACULAR THAT GREEK WORD WHICH
IS WRITTEN YONDER ON THE WALL
WHAT WORD
ANARKH
A SLIGHT FLUSH SPREAD OVER THE CHEEKS OF THE PRIEST WITH THEIR HIGH
BONES LIKE THE PUFF OF SMOKE WHICH ANNOUNCES ON THE OUTSIDE THE SECRET
COMMOTIONS OF A VOLCANO
THE STUDENT HARDLY NOTICED IT
WELL JEHAN STAMMERED THE ELDER BROTHER WITH AN EFFORT WHAT IS THE
MEANING OF YONDER WORD
FATE
DOM CLAUDE TURNED PALE AGAIN AND THE SCHOLAR PURSUED CARELESSLY
AND THAT WORD BELOW IT GRAVED BY THE SAME HAND AYYVELA SIGNIFIES
'IMPURITY YOU SEE THAT PEOPLE DO KNOW THEIR GREEK
AND THE ARCHDEACON REMAINED SILENT
THIS GREEK LESSON HAD RENDERED HIM
THOUGHTFUL
MASTER JEHAN WHO POSSESSED ALL THE ARTFUL WAYS OF A SPOILED CHILD
JUDGED THAT THE MOMENT WAS A FAVORABLE ONE IN WHICH TO RISK HIS REQUEST
ACCORDINGLY HE ASSUMED AN EXTREMELY SOFT TONE AND BEGAN
MY GOOD BROTHER DO YOU HATE ME TO SUCH A DEGREE AS TO LOOK SAVAGELY
UPON ME BECAUSE OF A FEW MISCHIEVOUS CUFFS AND BLOWS DISTRIBUTED IN A
FAIR WAR TO A PACK OF LADS AND BRATS QUIBUSDAM MARMOSETIS YOU SEE
GOOD BROTHER CLAUDE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THEIR LATIN
BUT ALL THIS CARESSING HYPOCRISY DID NOT HAVE ITS USUAL EFFECT ON THE
SEVERE ELDER BROTHER
CERBERUS DID NOT BITE AT THE HONEY CAKE
THE
ARCHDEACON'S BROW DID NOT LOSE A SINGLE WRINKLE
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT HE SAID DRYLY
WELL IN POINT OF FACT THIS REPLIED JEHAN BRAVELY I STAND IN NEED
OF MONEY
AT THIS AUDACIOUS DECLARATION THE ARCHDEACON'S VISAGE ASSUMED A
THOROUGHLY PEDAGOGICAL AND PATERNAL EXPRESSION
YOU KNOW MONSIEUR JEHAN THAT OUR FIEF OF TIRECHAPPE PUTTING THE
DIRECT TAXES AND THE RENTS OF THE NINE AND TWENTY HOUSES IN A BLOCK
YIELDS ONLY NINE AND THIRTY LIVRES ELEVEN SOUS SIX DENIERS PARISIAN
IT IS ONE HALF MORE THAN IN THE TIME OF THE BROTHERS PACLET BUT IT IS
NOT MUCH
I NEED MONEY SAID JEHAN STOICALLY
YOU KNOW THAT THE OFFICIAL HAS DECIDED THAT OUR TWENTY ONE HOUSES
SHOULD HE MOVED FULL INTO THE FIEF OF THE BISHOPRIC AND THAT WE COULD
REDEEM THIS HOMAGE ONLY BY PAYING THE REVEREND BISHOP TWO MARKS OF
SILVER GILT OF THE PRICE OF SIX LIVRES PARISIS
NOW THESE TWO MARKS I
HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO GET TOGETHER
YOU KNOW IT
I KNOW THAT I STAND IN NEED OF MONEY REPEATED JEHAN FOR THE THIRD
TIME
AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT
THIS QUESTION CAUSED A FLASH OF HOPE TO GLEAM BEFORE JEHAN'S EYES
HE
RESUMED HIS DAINTY CARESSING AIR
STAY DEAR BROTHER CLAUDE I SHOULD NOT COME TO YOU WITH ANY EVIL
MOTIVE
THERE IS NO INTENTION OF CUTTING A DASH IN THE TAVERNS WITH YOUR
UNZAINS AND OF STRUTTING ABOUT THE STREETS OF PARIS IN A CAPARISON OF
GOLD BROCADE WITH A LACKEY CUM MEO LAQUASIO
NO BROTHER 'TIS FOR A
GOOD WORK
WHAT GOOD WORK DEMANDED CLAUDE SOMEWHAT SURPRISED
TWO OF MY FRIENDS WISH TO PURCHASE AN OUTFIT FOR THE INFANT OF A POOR
HAUDRIETTE WIDOW
IT IS A CHARITY
IT WILL COST THREE FORMS AND I
SHOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT
WHAT ARE NAMES OF YOUR TWO FRIENDS
PIERRE L'ASSOMMEUR AND BAPTISTE CROQUE OISON
PETER THE SLAUGHTERER AND BAPTIST CRACK GOSLING
HUM SAID THE ARCHDEACON THOSE ARE NAMES AS FIT FOR A GOOD WORK AS A
CATAPULT FOR THE CHIEF ALTAR
IT IS CERTAIN THAT JEHAN HAD MADE A VERY BAD CHOICE OF NAMES FOR HIS TWO
FRIENDS
HE REALIZED IT TOO LATE
AND THEN PURSUED THE SAGACIOUS CLAUDE WHAT SORT OF AN INFANT'S
OUTFIT IS IT THAT IS TO COST THREE FORMS AND THAT FOR THE CHILD OF A
HAUDRIETTE SINCE WHEN HAVE THE HAUDRIETTE WIDOWS TAKEN TO HAVING BABES
IN SWADDLING CLOTHES
JEHAN BROKE THE ICE ONCE MORE
EH WELL YES I NEED MONEY IN ORDER TO GO AND SEE ISABEAU LA THIERRYE
TO NIGHT IN THE VAL D' AMOUR
IMPURE WRETCH EXCLAIMED THE PRIEST
AVAYVEIA SAID JEHAN
THIS QUOTATION WHICH THE SCHOLAR BORROWED WITH MALICE PERCHANCE FROM
THE WALL OF THE CELL PRODUCED A SINGULAR EFFECT ON THE ARCHDEACON
HE
BIT HIS LIPS AND HIS WRATH WAS DROWNED IN A CRIMSON FLUSH
BEGONE HE SAID TO JEHAN
I AM EXPECTING SOME ONE
THE SCHOLAR MADE ONE MORE EFFORT
BROTHER CLAUDE GIVE ME AT LEAST ONE LITTLE PARISIS TO BUY SOMETHING TO
EAT
HOW FAR HAVE YOU GONE IN THE DECRETALS OF GRATIAN DEMANDED DOM
CLAUDE
I HAVE LOST MY COPY BOOKS
WHERE ARE YOU IN YOUR LATIN HUMANITIES
MY COPY OF HORACE HAS BEEN STOLEN
WHERE ARE YOU IN ARISTOTLE
I' FAITH BROTHER WHAT FATHER OF THE CHURCH IS IT WHO SAYS THAT THE
ERRORS OF HERETICS HAVE ALWAYS HAD FOR THEIR LURKING PLACE THE THICKETS
OF ARISTOTLE'S METAPHYSICS A PLAGUE ON ARISTOTLE I CARE NOT TO TEAR MY
RELIGION ON HIS METAPHYSICS
YOUNG MAN RESUMED THE ARCHDEACON AT THE KING'S LAST ENTRY THERE
WAS A YOUNG GENTLEMAN NAMED PHILIPPE DE COMINES WHO WORE EMBROIDERED
ON THE HOUSINGS OF HIS HORSE THIS DEVICE UPON WHICH I COUNSEL YOU TO
MEDITATE QUI NON LABORAT NON MANDUCET
THE SCHOLAR REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT WITH HIS FINGER IN HIS EAR
HIS EYES ON THE GROUND AND A DISCOMFITED MIEN
ALL AT ONCE HE TURNED ROUND TO CLAUDE WITH THE AGILE QUICKNESS OF A
WAGTAIL
SO MY GOOD BROTHER YOU REFUSE ME A SOU PARISIS WHEREWITH TO BUY A
CRUST AT A BAKER'S SHOP
QUI NON LABORAT NON MANDUCET
AT THIS RESPONSE OF THE INFLEXIBLE ARCHDEACON JEHAN HID HIS HEAD IN
HIS HANDS LIKE A WOMAN SOBBING AND EXCLAIMED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF
DESPAIR OROROROROROI
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS SIR DEMANDED CLAUDE SURPRISED AT THIS
FREAK
WHAT INDEED SAID THE SCHOLAR AND HE LIFTED TO CLAUDE HIS IMPUDENT
EYES INTO WHICH HE HAD JUST THRUST HIS FISTS IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE TO
THEM THE REDNESS OF TEARS 'TIS GREEK 'TIS AN ANAPAEST OF AESCHYLUS
WHICH EXPRESSES GRIEF PERFECTLY
AND HERE HE BURST INTO A LAUGH SO DROLL AND VIOLENT THAT IT MADE THE
ARCHDEACON SMILE
IT WAS CLAUDE'S FAULT IN FACT WHY HAD HE SO SPOILED
THAT CHILD
OH GOOD BROTHER CLAUDE RESUMED JEHAN EMBOLDENED BY THIS SMILE
LOOK AT MY WORN OUT BOOTS
IS THERE A COTHURNUS IN THE WORLD MORE
TRAGIC THAN THESE BOOTS WHOSE SOLES ARE HANGING OUT THEIR TONGUES
THE ARCHDEACON PROMPTLY RETURNED TO HIS ORIGINAL SEVERITY
I WILL SEND YOU SOME NEW BOOTS BUT NO MONEY
ONLY A POOR LITTLE PARISIS BROTHER CONTINUED THE SUPPLIANT JEHAN
I
WILL LEARN GRATIAN BY HEART I WILL BELIEVE FIRMLY IN GOD I WILL BE
A REGULAR PYTHAGORAS OF SCIENCE AND VIRTUE
BUT ONE LITTLE PARISIS IN
MERCY WOULD YOU HAVE FAMINE BITE ME WITH ITS JAWS WHICH ARE GAPING IN
FRONT OF ME BLACKER DEEPER AND MORE NOISOME THAN A TARTARUS OR THE
NOSE OF A MONK
DOM CLAUDE SHOOK HIS WRINKLED HEAD QUI NON LABORAT
JEHAN DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO FINISH
WELL HE EXCLAIMED TO THE DEVIL THEN LONG LIVE JOY I WILL LIVE IN
THE TAVERN I WILL FIGHT I WILL BREAK POTS AND I WILL GO AND SEE THE
WENCHES AND THEREUPON HE HURLED HIS CAP AT THE WALL AND SNAPPED HIS
FINGERS LIKE CASTANETS
THE ARCHDEACON SURVEYED HIM WITH A GLOOMY AIR
JEHAN YOU HAVE NO SOUL
IN THAT CASE ACCORDING TO EPICURIUS I LACK A SOMETHING MADE OF
ANOTHER SOMETHING WHICH HAS NO NAME
JEHAN YOU MUST THINK SERIOUSLY OF AMENDING YOUR WAYS
OH COME NOW CRIED THE STUDENT GAZING IN TURN AT HIS BROTHER AND THE
ALEMBICS ON THE FURNACE EVERYTHING IS PREPOSTEROUS HERE BOTH IDEAS
AND BOTTLES
JEHAN YOU ARE ON A VERY SLIPPERY DOWNWARD ROAD
DO YOU KNOW WHITHER
YOU ARE GOING
TO THE WINE SHOP SAID JEHAN
THE WINE SHOP LEADS TO THE PILLORY
'TIS AS GOOD A LANTERN AS ANY OTHER AND PERCHANCE WITH THAT ONE
DIOGENES WOULD HAVE FOUND HIS MAN
THE PILLORY LEADS TO THE GALLOWS
THE GALLOWS IS A BALANCE WHICH HAS A MAN AT ONE END AND THE WHOLE EARTH
AT THE OTHER
'TIS FINE TO BE THE MAN
THE GALLOWS LEADS TO HELL
'TIS A BIG FIRE
JEHAN JEHAN THE END WILL BE BAD
THE BEGINNING WILL HAVE BEEN GOOD
AT THAT MOMENT THE SOUND OF A FOOTSTEP WAS HEARD ON THE STAIRCASE
SILENCE SAID THE ARCHDEACON LAYING HIS FINGER ON HIS MOUTH HERE IS
MASTER JACQUES
LISTEN JEHAN HE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE HAVE A CARE
NEVER TO SPEAK OF WHAT YOU SHALL HAVE SEEN OR HEARD HERE
HIDE YOURSELF
QUICKLY UNDER THE FURNACE AND DO NOT BREATHE
THE SCHOLAR CONCEALED HIMSELF JUST THEN A HAPPY IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM
BY THE WAY BROTHER CLAUDE A FORM FOR NOT BREATHING
SILENCE I PROMISE
YOU MUST GIVE IT TO ME
TAKE IT THEN SAID THE ARCHDEACON ANGRILY FLINGING HIS PURSE AT HIM
JEHAN DARTED UNDER THE FURNACE AGAIN AND THE DOOR OPENED
CHAPTER V
THE TWO MEN CLOTHED IN BLACK
THE PERSONAGE WHO ENTERED WORE A BLACK GOWN AND A GLOOMY MIEN
THE FIRST
POINT WHICH STRUCK THE EYE OF OUR JEHAN WHO AS THE READER WILL READILY
SURMISE HAD ENSCONCED HIMSELF IN HIS NOOK IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO ENABLE
HIM TO SEE AND HEAR EVERYTHING AT HIS GOOD PLEASURE WAS THE PERFECT
SADNESS OF THE GARMENTS AND THE VISAGE OF THIS NEW CORNER
THERE WAS
NEVERTHELESS SOME SWEETNESS DIFFUSED OVER THAT FACE BUT IT WAS THE
SWEETNESS OF A CAT OR A JUDGE AN AFFECTED TREACHEROUS SWEETNESS
HE
WAS VERY GRAY AND WRINKLED AND NOT FAR FROM HIS SIXTIETH YEAR HIS
EYES BLINKED HIS EYEBROWS WERE WHITE HIS LIP PENDULOUS AND HIS HANDS
LARGE
WHEN JEHAN SAW THAT IT WAS ONLY THIS THAT IS TO SAY NO DOUBT
A PHYSICIAN OR A MAGISTRATE AND THAT THIS MAN HAD A NOSE VERY FAR FROM
HIS MOUTH A SIGN OF STUPIDITY HE NESTLED DOWN IN HIS HOLE IN DESPAIR
AT BEING OBLIGED TO PASS AN INDEFINITE TIME IN SUCH AN UNCOMFORTABLE
ATTITUDE AND IN SUCH BAD COMPANY
THE ARCHDEACON IN THE MEANTIME HAD NOT EVEN RISEN TO RECEIVE THIS
PERSONAGE
HE HAD MADE THE LATTER A SIGN TO SEAT HIMSELF ON A STOOL NEAR
THE DOOR AND AFTER SEVERAL MOMENTS OF A SILENCE WHICH APPEARED TO BE
A CONTINUATION OF A PRECEDING MEDITATION HE SAID TO HIM IN A RATHER
PATRONIZING WAY GOOD DAY MASTER JACQUES
GREETING MASTER REPLIED THE MAN IN BLACK
THERE WAS IN THE TWO WAYS IN WHICH MASTER JACQUES WAS PRONOUNCED
ON THE ONE HAND AND THE MASTER BY PREEMINENCE ON THE OTHER THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MONSEIGNEUR AND MONSIEUR BETWEEN DOMINE AND
DOMNE
IT WAS EVIDENTLY THE MEETING OF A TEACHER AND A DISCIPLE
WELL RESUMED THE ARCHDEACON AFTER A FRESH SILENCE WHICH MASTER
JACQUES TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO DISTURB HOW ARE YOU SUCCEEDING
ALAS MASTER SAID THE OTHER WITH A SAD SMILE I AM STILL SEEKING
THE STONE
PLENTY OF ASHES
BUT NOT A SPARK OF GOLD
DOM CLAUDE MADE A GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE
I AM NOT TALKING TO YOU OF
THAT MASTER JACQUES CHARMOLUE BUT OF THE TRIAL OF YOUR MAGICIAN
IS IT
NOT MARC CENAINE THAT YOU CALL HIM THE BUTLER OF THE COURT OF ACCOUNTS
DOES HE CONFESS HIS WITCHCRAFT HAVE YOU BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH THE
TORTURE
ALAS NO REPLIED MASTER JACQUES STILL WITH HIS SAD SMILE WE HAVE
NOT THAT CONSOLATION
THAT MAN IS A STONE
WE MIGHT HAVE HIM BOILED IN
THE MARCH AUX POURCEAUX BEFORE HE WOULD SAY ANYTHING
NEVERTHELESS WE
ARE SPARING NOTHING FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING AT THE TRUTH HE IS ALREADY
THOROUGHLY DISLOCATED WE ARE APPLYING ALL THE HERBS OF SAINT JOHN'S
DAY AS SAITH THE OLD COMEDIAN PLAUTUS
'ADVORSUM STIMULOS LAMINAS CRUCESQUE COMPEDESQUE
NERROS CATENAS CARCERES NUMELLAS PEDICAS BOIAS
NOTHING ANSWERS THAT MAN IS TERRIBLE
I AM AT MY WIT'S END OVER HIM
YOU HAVE FOUND NOTHING NEW IN HIS HOUSE
I' FAITH YES SAID MASTER JACQUES FUMBLING IN HIS POUCH THIS
PARCHMENT
THERE ARE WORDS IN IT WHICH WE CANNOT COMPREHEND
THE
CRIMINAL ADVOCATE MONSIEUR PHILIPPE LHEULIER NEVERTHELESS KNOWS A
LITTLE HEBREW WHICH HE LEARNED IN THAT MATTER OF THE JEWS OF THE RUE
KANTERSTEN AT BRUSSELS
SO SAYING MASTER JACQUES UNROLLED A PARCHMENT
GIVE IT HERE SAID THE
ARCHDEACON
AND CASTING HIS EYES UPON THIS WRITING PURE MAGIC MASTER
JACQUES HE EXCLAIMED
'EMEN HTAN 'TIS THE CRY OF THE VAMPIRES
WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE WITCHES' SABBATH
PER IPSUM ET CUM IPSO ET IN
IPSO 'TIS THE COMMAND WHICH CHAINS THE DEVIL IN HELL
HAX PAX MAX
THAT REFERS TO MEDICINE
A FORMULA AGAINST THE BITE OF MAD DOGS
MASTER
JACQUES YOU ARE PROCURATOR TO THE KING IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL COURTS
THIS PARCHMENT IS ABOMINABLE
WE WILL PUT THE MAN TO THE TORTURE ONCE MORE
HERE AGAIN ADDED MASTER
JACQUES FUMBLING AFRESH IN HIS POUCH IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE FOUND
AT MARC CENAINE'S HOUSE
IT WAS A VESSEL BELONGING TO THE SAME FAMILY AS THOSE WHICH COVERED DOM
CLAUDE'S FURNACE
AH SAID THE ARCHDEACON A CRUCIBLE FOR ALCHEMY
I WILL CONFESS TO YOU CONTINUED MASTER JACQUES WITH HIS TIMID
AND AWKWARD SMILE THAT I HAVE TRIED IT OVER THE FURNACE BUT I HAVE
SUCCEEDED NO BETTER THAN WITH MY OWN
THE ARCHDEACON BEGAN AN EXAMINATION OF THE VESSEL
WHAT HAS HE ENGRAVED
ON HIS CRUCIBLE OCH OCH THE WORD WHICH EXPELS FLEAS THAT MARC
CENAINE IS AN IGNORAMUS I VERILY BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL NEVER MAKE GOLD
WITH THIS 'TIS GOOD TO SET IN YOUR BEDROOM IN SUMMER AND THAT IS ALL
SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ERRORS SAID THE KING'S PROCURATOR I
HAVE JUST BEEN STUDYING THE FIGURES ON THE PORTAL BELOW BEFORE ASCENDING
HITHER IS YOUR REVERENCE QUITE SURE THAT THE OPENING OF THE WORK OF
PHYSICS IS THERE PORTRAYED ON THE SIDE TOWARDS THE HTEL DIEU AND THAT
AMONG THE SEVEN NUDE FIGURES WHICH STAND AT THE FEET OF NOTRE DAME THAT
WHICH HAS WINGS ON HIS HEELS IS MERCURIUS
YES REPLIED THE PRIEST 'TIS AUGUSTIN NYPHO WHO WRITES IT THAT
ITALIAN DOCTOR WHO HAD A BEARDED DEMON WHO ACQUAINTED HIM WITH ALL
THINGS
HOWEVER WE WILL DESCEND AND I WILL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU WITH THE
TEXT BEFORE US
THANKS MASTER SAID CHARMOLUE BOWING TO THE EARTH
BY THE WAY I
WAS ON THE POINT OF FORGETTING
WHEN DOTH IT PLEASE YOU THAT I SHALL
APPREHEND THE LITTLE SORCERESS
WHAT SORCERESS
THAT GYPSY GIRL YOU KNOW WHO COMES EVERY DAY TO DANCE ON THE CHURCH
SQUARE IN SPITE OF THE OFFICIAL'S PROHIBITION SHE HATH A DEMONIAC
GOAT WITH HORNS OF THE DEVIL WHICH READS WHICH WRITES WHICH KNOWS
MATHEMATICS LIKE PICATRIX AND WHICH WOULD SUFFICE TO HANG ALL BOHEMIA
THE PROSECUTION IS ALL READY 'TWILL SOON BE FINISHED I ASSURE YOU A
PRETTY CREATURE ON MY SOUL THAT DANCER THE HANDSOMEST BLACK EYES TWO
EGYPTIAN CARBUNCLES WHEN SHALL WE BEGIN
THE ARCHDEACON WAS EXCESSIVELY PALE
I WILL TELL YOU THAT HEREAFTER HE STAMMERED IN A VOICE THAT WAS
BARELY ARTICULATE THEN HE RESUMED WITH AN EFFORT BUSY YOURSELF WITH
MARC CENAINE
BE AT EASE SAID CHARMOLUE WITH A SMILE I'LL BUCKLE HIM DOWN AGAIN
FOR YOU ON THE LEATHER BED WHEN I GET HOME
BUT 'TIS A DEVIL OF A MAN
HE WEARIES EVEN PIERRAT TORTERUE HIMSELF WHO HATH HANDS LARGER THAN MY
OWN
AS THAT GOOD PLAUTUS SAITH
NUDUS VINCTUS CENTUM PONDO
ES QUANDO PENDES PER PEDES
THE TORTURE OF THE WHEEL AND AXLE 'TIS THE MOST EFFECTUAL HE SHALL
TASTE IT
DOM CLAUDE SEEMED ABSORBED IN GLOOMY ABSTRACTION
HE TURNED TO
CHARMOLUE
MASTER PIERRAT MASTER JACQUES I MEAN BUSY YOURSELF WITH MARC
CENAINE

ACCOUNTS WHO OUGHT TO KNOW CHARLEMAGNE'S TEXT STRYGA VEL MASEA IN
THE MATTER OF THE LITTLE GIRL SMELARDA AS THEY CALL HER I WILL
AWAIT YOUR ORDERS
AH AS WE PASS THROUGH THE PORTAL YOU WILL EXPLAIN
TO ME ALSO THE MEANING OF THE GARDENER PAINTED IN RELIEF WHICH ONE SEES
AS ONE ENTERS THE CHURCH
IS IT NOT THE SOWER H MASTER OF WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING PRAY
DOM CLAUDE BURIED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS NO LONGER LISTENED TO HIM
CHARMOLUE FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF HIS GLANCE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS
FIXED MECHANICALLY ON THE GREAT SPIDER'S WEB WHICH DRAPED THE WINDOW
AT THAT MOMENT A BEWILDERED FLY WHICH WAS SEEKING THE MARCH SUN FLUNG
ITSELF THROUGH THE NET AND BECAME ENTANGLED THERE
ON THE AGITATION OF
HIS WEB THE ENORMOUS SPIDER MADE AN ABRUPT MOVE FROM HIS CENTRAL CELL
THEN WITH ONE BOUND RUSHED UPON THE FLY WHICH HE FOLDED TOGETHER WITH
HIS FORE ANTENNAE WHILE HIS HIDEOUS PROBOSCIS DUG INTO THE VICTIM'S
BEAD
POOR FLY SAID THE KING'S PROCURATOR IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL
COURT AND HE RAISED HIS HAND TO SAVE IT
THE ARCHDEACON AS THOUGH
ROUSED WITH A START WITHHELD HIS ARM WITH CONVULSIVE VIOLENCE
MASTER JACQUES HE CRIED LET FATE TAKE ITS COURSE THE PROCURATOR
WHEELED ROUND IN AFFRIGHT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT PINCERS OF IRON HAD
CLUTCHED HIS ARM
THE PRIEST'S EYE WAS STARING WILD FLAMING AND
REMAINED RIVETED ON THE HORRIBLE LITTLE GROUP OF THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
OH YES CONTINUED THE PRIEST IN A VOICE WHICH SEEMED TO PROCEED FROM
THE DEPTHS OF HIS BEING BEHOLD HERE A SYMBOL OF ALL
SHE FLIES SHE IS
JOYOUS SHE IS JUST BORN SHE SEEKS THE SPRING THE OPEN AIR LIBERTY
OH YES BUT LET HER COME IN CONTACT WITH THE FATAL NETWORK AND
THE SPIDER ISSUES FROM IT THE HIDEOUS SPIDER POOR DANCER POOR
PREDESTINED FLY LET THINGS TAKE THEIR COURSE MASTER JACQUES 'TIS
FATE ALAS CLAUDE THOU ART THE SPIDER CLAUDE THOU ART THE FLY ALSO
THOU WERT FLYING TOWARDS LEARNING LIGHT THE SUN
THOU HADST NO OTHER
CARE THAN TO REACH THE OPEN AIR THE FULL DAYLIGHT OF ETERNAL TRUTH BUT
IN PRECIPITATING THYSELF TOWARDS THE DAZZLING WINDOW WHICH OPENS UPON
THE OTHER WORLD UPON THE WORLD OF BRIGHTNESS INTELLIGENCE AND
SCIENCE BLIND FLY SENSELESS LEARNED MAN THOU HAST NOT PERCEIVED
THAT SUBTLE SPIDER'S WEB STRETCHED BY DESTINY BETWIXT THE LIGHT
AND THEE THOU HAST FLUNG THYSELF HEADLONG INTO IT AND NOW THOU ART
STRUGGLING WITH HEAD BROKEN AND MANGLED WINGS BETWEEN THE IRON ANTENNAE
OF FATE MASTER JACQUES MASTER JACQUES LET THE SPIDER WORK ITS WILL
I ASSURE YOU SAID CHARMOLUE WHO WAS GAZING AT HIM WITHOUT
COMPREHENDING HIM THAT I WILL NOT TOUCH IT
BUT RELEASE MY ARM
MASTER FOR PITY'S SAKE YOU HAVE A HAND LIKE A PAIR OF PINCERS
THE ARCHDEACON DID NOT HEAR HIM
OH MADMAN HE WENT ON WITHOUT
REMOVING HIS GAZE FROM THE WINDOW
AND EVEN COULDST THOU HAVE BROKEN
THROUGH THAT FORMIDABLE WEB WITH THY GNAT'S WINGS THOU BELIEVEST THAT
THOU COULDST HAVE REACHED THE LIGHT ALAS THAT PANE OF GLASS WHICH IS
FURTHER ON THAT TRANSPARENT OBSTACLE THAT WALL OF CRYSTAL HARDER THAN
BRASS WHICH SEPARATES ALL PHILOSOPHIES FROM THE TRUTH HOW WOULDST THOU
HAVE OVERCOME IT OH VANITY OF SCIENCE HOW MANY WISE MEN COME FLYING
FROM AFAR TO DASH THEIR HEADS AGAINST THEE HOW MANY SYSTEMS VAINLY
FLING THEMSELVES BUZZING AGAINST THAT ETERNAL PANE
HE BECAME SILENT
THESE LAST IDEAS WHICH HAD GRADUALLY LED HIM BACK
FROM HIMSELF TO SCIENCE APPEARED TO HAVE CALMED HIM
JACQUES CHARMOLUE
RECALLED HIM WHOLLY TO A SENSE OF REALITY BY ADDRESSING TO HIM THIS
QUESTION COME NOW MASTER WHEN WILL YOU COME TO AID ME IN MAKING
GOLD I AM IMPATIENT TO SUCCEED
THE ARCHDEACON SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A BITTER SMILE
MASTER JACQUES READ
MICHEL PSELLUS' DIALOGUS DE ENERGIA ET OPERATIONE DAEMONUM WHAT WE
ARE DOING IS NOT WHOLLY INNOCENT
SPEAK LOWER MASTER I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS OF IT SAID JACQUES
CHARMOLUE
BUT ONE MUST PRACTISE A BIT OF HERMETIC SCIENCE WHEN ONE
IS ONLY PROCURATOR OF THE KING IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL COURT AT THIRTY
CROWNS TOURNOIS A YEAR
ONLY SPEAK LOW
AT THAT MOMENT THE SOUND OF JAWS IN THE ACT OF MASTICATION WHICH
PROCEEDED FROM BENEATH THE FURNACE STRUCK CHARMOLUE'S UNEASY EAR
WHAT'S THAT HE INQUIRED
IT WAS THE SCHOLAR WHO ILL AT EASE AND GREATLY BORED IN HIS
HIDING PLACE HAD SUCCEEDED IN DISCOVERING THERE A STALE CRUST AND A
TRIANGLE OF MOULDY CHEESE AND HAD SET TO DEVOURING THE WHOLE WITHOUT
CEREMONY BY WAY OF CONSOLATION AND BREAKFAST
AS HE WAS VERY HUNGRY
HE MADE A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE AND HE ACCENTED EACH MOUTHFUL STRONGLY
WHICH STARTLED AND ALARMED THE PROCURATOR
'TIS A CAT OF MINE SAID THE ARCHDEACON QUICKLY WHO IS REGALING
HERSELF UNDER THERE WITH A MOUSE
THIS EXPLANATION SATISFIED CHARMOLUE
IN FACT MASTER HE REPLIED WITH A RESPECTFUL SMILE ALL GREAT
PHILOSOPHERS HAVE THEIR FAMILIAR ANIMAL
YOU KNOW WHAT SERVIUS SAITH NULLUS ENIM LOCUS SINE GENIO EST FOR THERE IS NO PLACE THAT HATH
NOT ITS SPIRIT
BUT DOM CLAUDE WHO STOOD IN TERROR OF SOME NEW FREAK ON THE PART OF
JEHAN REMINDED HIS WORTHY DISCIPLE THAT THEY HAD SOME FIGURES ON
THE FAADE TO STUDY TOGETHER AND THE TWO QUITTED THE CELL TO THE
ACCOMPANIMENT OF A GREAT OUF FROM THE SCHOLAR WHO BEGAN TO SERIOUSLY
FEAR THAT HIS KNEE WOULD ACQUIRE THE IMPRINT OF HIS CHIN
CHAPTER VI
THE EFFECT WHICH SEVEN OATHS IN THE OPEN AIR CAN PRODUCE
TE DEUM LAUDAMUS EXCLAIMED MASTER JEHAN CREEPING OUT FROM HIS
HOLE THE SCREECH OWLS HAVE DEPARTED
OCH OCH HAX PAX MAX FLEAS
MAD DOGS THE DEVIL I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THEIR CONVERSATION MY HEAD
IS HUMMING LIKE A BELL TOWER
AND MOULDY CHEESE TO BOOT COME ON LET US
DESCEND TAKE THE BIG BROTHER'S PURSE AND CONVERT ALL THESE COINS INTO
BOTTLES
HE CAST A GLANCE OF TENDERNESS AND ADMIRATION INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE
PRECIOUS POUCH READJUSTED HIS TOILET RUBBED UP HIS BOOTS DUSTED HIS
POOR HALF SLEEVES ALL GRAY WITH ASHES WHISTLED AN AIR INDULGED IN A
SPORTIVE PIROUETTE LOOKED ABOUT TO SEE WHETHER THERE WERE NOT SOMETHING
MORE IN THE CELL TO TAKE GATHERED UP HERE AND THERE ON THE FURNACE SOME
AMULET IN GLASS WHICH MIGHT SERVE TO BESTOW IN THE GUISE OF A TRINKET
ON ISABEAU LA THIERRYE FINALLY PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR WHICH HIS BROTHER
HAD LEFT UNFASTENED AS A LAST INDULGENCE AND WHICH HE IN HIS
TURN LEFT OPEN AS A LAST PIECE OF MALICE AND DESCENDED THE CIRCULAR
STAIRCASE SKIPPING LIKE A BIRD
IN THE MIDST OF THE GLOOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE HE ELBOWED SOMETHING
WHICH DREW ASIDE WITH A GROWL HE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT IT WAS
QUASIMODO AND IT STRUCK HIM AS SO DROLL THAT HE DESCENDED THE REMAINDER
OF THE STAIRCASE HOLDING HIS SIDES WITH LAUGHTER
ON EMERGING UPON THE
PLACE HE LAUGHED YET MORE HEARTILY
HE STAMPED HIS FOOT WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE GROUND ONCE AGAIN
OH SAID HE GOOD AND HONORABLE PAVEMENT OF PARIS CURSED STAIRCASE
FIT TO PUT THE ANGELS OF JACOB'S LADDER OUT OF BREATH WHAT WAS I
THINKING OF TO THRUST MYSELF INTO THAT STONE GIMLET WHICH PIERCES THE
SKY ALL FOR THE SAKE OF EATING BEARDED CHEESE AND LOOKING AT THE
BELL TOWERS OF PARIS THROUGH A HOLE IN THE WALL
HE ADVANCED A FEW PACES AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TWO SCREECH OWLS
THAT IS TO SAY DOM CLAUDE AND MASTER JACQUES CHARMOLUE ABSORBED IN
CONTEMPLATION BEFORE A CARVING ON THE FAADE
HE APPROACHED THEM ON
TIPTOE AND HEARD THE ARCHDEACON SAY IN A LOW TONE TO CHARMOLUE 'TWAS
GUILLAUME DE PARIS WHO CAUSED A JOB TO BE CARVED UPON THIS STONE OF
THE HUE OF LAPIS LAZULI GILDED ON THE EDGES
JOB REPRESENTS THE
PHILOSOPHER'S STONE WHICH MUST ALSO BE TRIED AND MARTYRIZED IN ORDER
TO BECOME PERFECT AS SAITH RAYMOND LULLE SUB CONSERVATIONE FORMOE
SPECIFTOE SALVA ANIMA
THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME SAID JEHAN 'TIS I WHO HAVE THE
PURSE
AT THAT MOMENT HE HEARD A POWERFUL AND SONOROUS VOICE ARTICULATE BEHIND
HIM A FORMIDABLE SERIES OF OATHS
SANG DIEU VENTRE DIEU BDIEU
CORPS DE DIEU NOMBRIL DE BELZEBUTH NOM D'UN PAPE COME ET TONNERRE
UPON MY SOUL EXCLAIMED JEHAN THAT CAN ONLY BE MY FRIEND CAPTAIN
PHOEBUS
THIS NAME OF PHOEBUS REACHED THE EARS OF THE ARCHDEACON AT THE MOMENT
WHEN HE WAS EXPLAINING TO THE KING'S PROCURATOR THE DRAGON WHICH IS
HIDING ITS TAIL IN A BATH FROM WHICH ISSUE SMOKE AND THE HEAD OF
A KING
DOM CLAUDE STARTED INTERRUPTED HIMSELF AND TO THE GREAT
AMAZEMENT OF CHARMOLUE TURNED ROUND AND BEHELD HIS BROTHER JEHAN
ACCOSTING A TALL OFFICER AT THE DOOR OF THE GONDELAURIER MANSION
IT WAS IN FACT CAPTAIN PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS
HE WAS BACKED UP
AGAINST A CORNER OF THE HOUSE OF HIS BETROTHED AND SWEARING LIKE A
HEATHEN
BY MY FAITH CAPTAIN PHOEBUS SAID JEHAN TAKING HIM BY THE HAND YOU
ARE CURSING WITH ADMIRABLE VIGOR
HORNS AND THUNDER REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
HORNS AND THUNDER YOURSELF REPLIED THE STUDENT
COME NOW FAIR
CAPTAIN WHENCE COMES THIS OVERFLOW OF FINE WORDS
PARDON ME GOOD COMRADE JEHAN EXCLAIMED PHOEBUS SHAKING HIS HAND A
HORSE GOING AT A GALLOP CANNOT HALT SHORT
NOW I WAS SWEARING AT A HARD
GALLOP
I HAVE JUST BEEN WITH THOSE PRUDES AND WHEN I COME FORTH I
ALWAYS FIND MY THROAT FULL OF CURSES I MUST SPIT THEM OUT OR STRANGLE
VENTRE ET TONNERRE
WILL YOU COME AND DRINK ASKED THE SCHOLAR
THIS PROPOSITION CALMED THE CAPTAIN
I'M WILLING BUT I HAVE NO MONEY
BUT I HAVE
BAH LET'S SEE IT
JEHAN SPREAD OUT THE PURSE BEFORE THE CAPTAIN'S EYES WITH DIGNITY AND
SIMPLICITY
MEANWHILE THE ARCHDEACON WHO HAD ABANDONED THE DUMBFOUNDED
CHARMOLUE WHERE HE STOOD HAD APPROACHED THEM AND HALTED A FEW PACES
DISTANT WATCHING THEM WITHOUT THEIR NOTICING HIM SO DEEPLY WERE THEY
ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE PURSE
PHOEBUS EXCLAIMED A PURSE IN YOUR POCKET JEHAN 'TIS THE MOON IN A
BUCKET OF WATER ONE SEES IT THERE BUT 'TIS NOT THERE
THERE IS NOTHING
BUT ITS SHADOW
PARDIEU LET US WAGER THAT THESE ARE PEBBLES
JEHAN REPLIED COLDLY HERE ARE THE PEBBLES WHEREWITH I PAVE MY FOB
AND WITHOUT ADDING ANOTHER WORD HE EMPTIED THE PURSE ON A NEIGHBORING
POST WITH THE AIR OF A ROMAN SAVING HIS COUNTRY
TRUE GOD MUTTERED PHOEBUS TARGES BIG BLANKS LITTLE BLANKS
MAILLES EVERY TWO WORTH ONE OF TOURNAY FARTHINGS OF PARIS REAL EAGLE
LIARDS 'TIS DAZZLING
AN ANCIENT COPPER COIN THE FORTY FOURTH PART OF A SOU OR
THE TWELFTH PART OF A FARTHING
JEHAN REMAINED DIGNIFIED AND IMMOVABLE
SEVERAL LIARDS HAD ROLLED INTO
THE MUD THE CAPTAIN IN HIS ENTHUSIASM STOOPED TO PICK THEM UP
JEHAN
RESTRAINED HIM
FYE CAPTAIN PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS
PHOEBUS COUNTED THE COINS AND TURNING TOWARDS JEHAN WITH SOLEMNITY DO
YOU KNOW JEHAN THAT THERE ARE THREE AND TWENTY SOUS PARISIS WHOM HAVE
YOU PLUNDERED TO NIGHT IN THE STREET CUT WEAZAND
JEHAN FLUNG BACK HIS BLONDE AND CURLY HEAD AND SAID HALF CLOSING HIS
EYES DISDAINFULLY
WE HAVE A BROTHER WHO IS AN ARCHDEACON AND A FOOL
CORNE DE DIEU EXCLAIMED PHOEBUS THE WORTHY MAN
LET US GO AND DRINK SAID JEHAN
WHERE SHALL WE GO SAID PHOEBUS 'TO EVE'S APPLE
NO CAPTAIN TO 'ANCIENT SCIENCE AN OLD WOMAN SAWING A BASKET
HANDLE 'TIS A REBUS AND I LIKE THAT
UNE VIELLE QUI SCIE UNE ANSE
A PLAGUE ON REBUSES JEHAN THE WINE IS BETTER AT 'EVE'S APPLE' AND
THEN BESIDE THE DOOR THERE IS A VINE IN THE SUN WHICH CHEERS ME WHILE I
AM DRINKING
WELL HERE GOES FOR EVE AND HER APPLE SAID THE STUDENT AND TAKING
PHOEBUS'S ARM
BY THE WAY MY DEAR CAPTAIN YOU JUST MENTIONED THE RUE
COUPE GUEULE THAT IS A VERY BAD FORM OF SPEECH PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER SO
BARBAROUS
THEY SAY COUPE GORGE
CUT WEAZAND STREET
CUT THROAT STREET
THE TWO FRIENDS SET OUT TOWARDS EVE'S APPLE IT IS UNNECESSARY
TO MENTION THAT THEY HAD FIRST GATHERED UP THE MONEY AND THAT THE
ARCHDEACON FOLLOWED THEM
THE ARCHDEACON FOLLOWED THEM GLOOMY AND HAGGARD
WAS THIS THE PHOEBUS
WHOSE ACCURSED NAME HAD BEEN MINGLED WITH ALL HIS THOUGHTS EVER SINCE
HIS INTERVIEW WITH GRINGOIRE HE DID NOT KNOW IT BUT IT WAS AT LEAST A
PHOEBUS AND THAT MAGIC NAME SUFFICED TO MAKE THE ARCHDEACON FOLLOW THE
TWO HEEDLESS COMRADES WITH THE STEALTHY TREAD OF A WOLF LISTENING
TO THEIR WORDS AND OBSERVING THEIR SLIGHTEST GESTURES WITH ANXIOUS
ATTENTION
MOREOVER NOTHING WAS EASIER THAN TO HEAR EVERYTHING THEY
SAID AS THEY TALKED LOUDLY NOT IN THE LEAST CONCERNED THAT THE
PASSERS BY WERE TAKEN INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE
THEY TALKED OF DUELS
WENCHES WINE POTS AND FOLLY
AT THE TURNING OF A STREET THE SOUND OF A TAMBOURINE REACHED THEM FROM
A NEIGHBORING SQUARE
DOM CLAUDE HEARD THE OFFICER SAY TO THE SCHOLAR
THUNDER LET US HASTEN OUR STEPS
WHY PHOEBUS
I'M AFRAID LEST THE BOHEMIAN SHOULD SEE ME
WHAT BOHEMIAN
THE LITTLE GIRL WITH THE GOAT
LA SMERALDA
THAT'S IT JEHAN
I ALWAYS FORGET HER DEVIL OF A NAME
LET US MAKE
HASTE SHE WILL RECOGNIZE ME
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT GIRL ACCOST ME
IN THE STREET
DO YOU KNOW HER PHOEBUS
HERE THE ARCHDEACON SAW PHOEBUS SNEER BEND DOWN TO JEHAN'S EAR AND SAY
A FEW WORDS TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE THEN PHOEBUS BURST INTO A LAUGH AND
SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A TRIUMPHANT AIR
TRULY SAID JEHAN
UPON MY SOUL SAID PHOEBUS
THIS EVENING
THIS EVENING
ARE YOU SURE THAT SHE WILL COME
ARE YOU A FOOL JEHAN DOES ONE DOUBT SUCH THINGS
CAPTAIN PHOEBUS YOU ARE A HAPPY GENDARME
THE ARCHDEACON HEARD THE WHOLE OF THIS CONVERSATION
HIS TEETH
CHATTERED A VISIBLE SHIVER RAN THROUGH HIS WHOLE BODY
HE HALTED FOR A
MOMENT LEANED AGAINST A POST LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN THEN FOLLOWED THE TWO
MERRY KNAVES
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE OVERTOOK THEM ONCE MORE THEY HAD CHANGED THEIR
CONVERSATION

CHAPTER VII
THE MYSTERIOUS MONK
THE ILLUSTRIOUS WINE SHOP OF EVE'S APPLE WAS SITUATED IN THE
UNIVERSITY AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DE LA RONDELLE AND THE RUE DE LA
BTONNIER
IT WAS A VERY SPACIOUS AND VERY LOW HAIL ON THE GROUND FLOOR
WITH A VAULTED CEILING WHOSE CENTRAL SPRING RESTED UPON A HUGE PILLAR OF
WOOD PAINTED YELLOW TABLES EVERYWHERE SHINING PEWTER JUGS HANGING ON
THE WALLS ALWAYS A LARGE NUMBER OF DRINKERS A PLENTY OF WENCHES A
WINDOW ON THE STREET A VINE AT THE DOOR AND OVER THE DOOR A FLARING
PIECE OF SHEET IRON PAINTED WITH AN APPLE AND A WOMAN RUSTED BY
THE RAIN AND TURNING WITH THE WIND ON AN IRON PIN
THIS SPECIES OF
WEATHER VANE WHICH LOOKED UPON THE PAVEMENT WAS THE SIGNBOARD
NIGHT WAS FALLING THE SQUARE WAS DARK THE WINE SHOP FULL OF CANDLES
FLAMED AFAR LIKE A FORGE IN THE GLOOM THE NOISE OF GLASSES AND
FEASTING OF OATHS AND QUARRELS WHICH ESCAPED THROUGH THE BROKEN PANES
WAS AUDIBLE
THROUGH THE MIST WHICH THE WARMTH OF THE ROOM SPREAD OVER
THE WINDOW IN FRONT A HUNDRED CONFUSED FIGURES COULD BE SEEN SWARMING
AND FROM TIME TO TIME A BURST OF NOISY LAUGHTER BROKE FORTH FROM IT
THE PASSERS BY WHO WERE GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS SLIPPED PAST THIS
TUMULTUOUS WINDOW WITHOUT GLANCING AT IT
ONLY AT INTERVALS DID SOME
LITTLE RAGGED BOY RAISE HIMSELF ON TIPTOE AS FAR AS THE LEDGE AND HURL
INTO THE DRINKING SHOP THAT ANCIENT JEERING HOOT WITH WHICH DRUNKEN
MEN WERE THEN PURSUED AUX HOULS SAOULS SAOULS SAOULS
NEVERTHELESS ONE MAN PACED IMPERTURBABLY BACK AND FORTH IN FRONT OF THE
TAVERN GAZING AT IT INCESSANTLY AND GOING NO FURTHER FROM IT THAN A
PIKERNAN FROM HIS SENTRY BOX
HE WAS ENVELOPED IN A MANTLE TO HIS VERY
NOSE
THIS MANTLE HE HAD JUST PURCHASED OF THE OLD CLOTHES MAN IN THE
VICINITY OF THE EVE'S APPLE NO DOUBT TO PROTECT HIMSELF FROM THE COLD
OF THE MARCH EVENING POSSIBLY ALSO TO CONCEAL HIS COSTUME
FROM TIME
TO TIME HE PAUSED IN FRONT OF THE DIM WINDOW WITH ITS LEADEN LATTICE
LISTENED LOOKED AND STAMPED HIS FOOT
AT LENGTH THE DOOR OF THE DRAM SHOP OPENED
THIS WAS WHAT HE APPEARED TO
BE WAITING FOR
TWO BOON COMPANIONS CAME FORTH
THE RAY OF LIGHT WHICH
ESCAPED FROM THE DOOR CRIMSONED FOR A MOMENT THEIR JOVIAL FACES
THE MAN IN THE MANTLE WENT AND STATIONED HIMSELF ON THE WATCH UNDER A
PORCH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET
CORNE ET TONNERRE SAID ONE OF THE COMRADES
SEVEN O'CLOCK IS ON
THE POINT OF STRIKING
'TIS THE HOUR OF MY APPOINTED MEETING
I TELL YOU REPEATED HIS COMPANION WITH A THICK TONGUE THAT I DON'T
LIVE IN THE RUE DES MAUVAISES PAROLES INDIGNUS QUI INTER MALA VERBA
HABITAT
I HAVE A LODGING IN THE RUE JEAN PAIN MOLLET IN VICO
JOHANNIS PAIN MOLLET
YOU ARE MORE HORNED THAN A UNICORN IF YOU ASSERT
THE CONTRARY
EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT HE WHO ONCE MOUNTS ASTRIDE A BEAR
IS NEVER AFTER AFRAID BUT YOU HAVE A NOSE TURNED TO DAINTIES LIKE
SAINT JACQUES OF THE HOSPITAL
JEHAN MY FRIEND YOU ARE DRUNK SAID THE OTHER
THE OTHER REPLIED STAGGERING IT PLEASES YOU TO SAY SO PHOEBUS BUT IT
HATH BEEN PROVED THAT PLATO HAD THE PROFILE OF A HOUND
THE READER HAS NO DOUBT ALREADY RECOGNIZED OUR TWO BRAVE FRIENDS THE
CAPTAIN AND THE SCHOLAR
IT APPEARS THAT THE MAN WHO WAS LYING IN
WAIT FOR THEM HAD ALSO RECOGNIZED THEM FOR HE SLOWLY FOLLOWED ALL THE
ZIGZAGS THAT THE SCHOLAR CAUSED THE CAPTAIN TO MAKE WHO BEING A MORE
HARDENED DRINKER HAD RETAINED ALL HIS SELF POSSESSION
BY LISTENING TO
THEM ATTENTIVELY THE MAN IN THE MANTLE COULD CATCH IN ITS ENTIRETY THE
FOLLOWING INTERESTING CONVERSATION
CORBACQUE DO TRY TO WALK STRAIGHT MASTER BACHELOR YOU KNOW THAT I
MUST LEAVE YOU
HERE IT IS SEVEN O'CLOCK
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A
WOMAN
LEAVE ME THEN I SEE STARS AND LANCES OF FIRE
YOU ARE LIKE THE CHATEAU
DE DAMPMARTIN WHICH IS BURSTING WITH LAUGHTER
BY THE WARTS OF MY GRANDMOTHER JEHAN YOU ARE RAVING WITH TOO MUCH
RABIDNESS
BY THE WAY JEHAN HAVE YOU ANY MONEY LEFT
MONSIEUR RECTOR THERE IS NO MISTAKE THE LITTLE BUTCHER'S SHOP PARVA
BOUCHERIA
JEHAU MY FRIEND JEHAN YOU KNOW THAT I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THAT
LITTLE GIRL AT THE END OF THE PONT SAINT MICHEL AND I CAN ONLY TAKE HER
TO THE FALOURDEL'S THE OLD CRONE OF THE BRIDGE AND THAT I MUST PAY
FOR A CHAMBER
THE OLD WITCH WITH A WHITE MOUSTACHE WOULD NOT TRUST ME
JEHAN FOR PITY'S SAKE HAVE WE DRUNK UP THE WHOLE OF THE CUR'S PURSE
HAVE YOU NOT A SINGLE PARISIS LEFT
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING SPENT THE OTHER HOURS WELL IS A JUST AND
SAVORY CONDIMENT FOR THE TABLE
BELLY AND GUTS A TRUCE TO YOUR WHIMSICAL NONSENSE TELL ME JEHAN OF
THE DEVIL HAVE YOU ANY MONEY LEFT GIVE IT TO ME BDIEU OR I WILL
SEARCH YOU WERE YOU AS LEPROUS AS JOB AND AS SCABBY AS CAESAR
MONSIEUR THE RUE GALIACHE IS A STREET WHICH HATH AT ONE END THE RUE DE
LA VERRERIE AND AT THE OTHER THE RUE DE LA TIXERANDERIE
WELL YES MY GOOD FRIEND JEHAN MY POOR COMRADE THE RUE GALIACHE IS
GOOD VERY GOOD
BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN COLLECT YOUR WITS
I MUST
HAVE A SOU PARISIS AND THE APPOINTMENT IS FOR SEVEN O'CLOCK
SILENCE FOR THE RONDO AND ATTENTION TO THE REFRAIN
QUAND LES RATS MANGERONT LES CAS
LE ROI SERA SEIGNEUR D'ARRAS
QUAND LA MER QUI EST GRANDE ET LE E
SERA A LA SAINT JEAN GELE E
ON VERRA PAR DESSUS LA GLACE
SORTIR CEUX D'ARRAS DE LEUR PLACE
WHEN THE RATS EAT THE CATS THE KING WILL BE LORD OF ARRAS
WHEN THE SEA WHICH IS GREAT AND WIDE IS FROZEN OVER AT ST
JOHN'S TIDE
MEN WILL SEE ACROSS THE ICE THOSE WHO DWELL IN ARRAS QUIT THEIR PLACE
WELL SCHOLAR OF ANTICHRIST MAY YOU BE STRANGLED WITH THE ENTRAILS OF
YOUR MOTHER EXCLAIMED PHOEBUS AND HE GAVE THE DRUNKEN SCHOLAR A ROUGH
PUSH THE LATTER SLIPPED AGAINST THE WALL AND SLID FLABBILY TO THE
PAVEMENT OF PHILIP AUGUSTUS
A REMNANT OF FRATERNAL PITY WHICH NEVER
ABANDONS THE HEART OF A DRINKER PROMPTED PHOEBUS TO ROLL JEHAN WITH HIS
FOOT UPON ONE OF THOSE PILLOWS OF THE POOR WHICH PROVIDENCE KEEPS IN
READINESS AT THE CORNER OF ALL THE STREET POSTS OF PARIS AND WHICH
THE RICH BLIGHT WITH THE NAME OF A RUBBISH HEAP THE CAPTAIN ADJUSTED
JEHAN'S HEAD UPON AN INCLINED PLANE OF CABBAGE STUMPS AND ON THE VERY
INSTANT THE SCHOLAR FELL TO SNORING IN A MAGNIFICENT BASS
MEANWHILE
ALL MALICE WAS NOT EXTINGUISHED IN THE CAPTAIN'S HEART
SO MUCH THE
WORSE IF THE DEVIL'S CART PICKS YOU UP ON ITS PASSAGE HE SAID TO THE
POOR SLEEPING CLERK AND HE STRODE OFF
THE MAN IN THE MANTLE WHO HAD NOT CEASED TO FOLLOW HIM HALTED FOR A
MOMENT BEFORE THE PROSTRATE SCHOLAR AS THOUGH AGITATED BY INDECISION
THEN UTTERING A PROFOUND SIGH HE ALSO STRODE OFF IN PURSUIT OF THE
CAPTAIN
WE LIKE THEM WILL LEAVE JEHAN TO SLUMBER BENEATH THE OPEN SKY AND
WILL FOLLOW THEM ALSO IF IT PLEASES THE READER
ON EMERGING INTO THE RUE SAINT ANDR DES ARCS CAPTAIN PHOEBUS PERCEIVED
THAT SOME ONE WAS FOLLOWING HIM
ON GLANCING SIDEWAYS BY CHANCE HE
PERCEIVED A SORT OF SHADOW CRAWLING AFTER HIM ALONG THE WALLS
HE
HALTED IT HALTED HE RESUMED HIS MARCH IT RESUMED ITS MARCH
THIS
DISTURBED HIM NOT OVERMUCH
AH BAH HE SAID TO HIMSELF I HAVE NOT A
SOU
HE PAUSED IN FRONT OF THE COLLEGE D'AUTUN
IT WAS AT THIS COLLEGE THAT
HE HAD SKETCHED OUT WHAT HE CALLED HIS STUDIES AND THROUGH A SCHOLAR'S
TEASING HABIT WHICH STILL LINGERED IN HIM HE NEVER PASSED THE FAADE
WITHOUT INFLICTING ON THE STATUE OF CARDINAL PIERRE BERTRAND SCULPTURED
TO THE RIGHT OF THE PORTAL THE AFFRONT OF WHICH PRIAPUS COMPLAINS SO
BITTERLY IN THE SATIRE OF HORACE OLIM TRUNCUS ERAM FICULNUS
HE
HAD DONE THIS WITH SO MUCH UNRELENTING ANIMOSITY THAT THE INSCRIPTION
EDUENSIS EPISCOPUS HAD BECOME ALMOST EFFACED
THEREFORE HE HALTED
BEFORE THE STATUE ACCORDING TO HIS WONT
THE STREET WAS UTTERLY
DESERTED
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE WAS COOLLY RETYING HIS SHOULDER KNOTS
WITH HIS NOSE IN THE AIR HE SAW THE SHADOW APPROACHING HIM WITH SLOW
STEPS SO SLOW THAT HE HAD AMPLE TIME TO OBSERVE THAT THIS SHADOW WORE
A CLOAK AND A HAT
ON ARRIVING NEAR HIM IT HALTED AND REMAINED MORE
MOTIONLESS THAN THE STATUE OF CARDINAL BERTRAND
MEANWHILE IT RIVETED
UPON PHOEBUS TWO INTENT EYES FULL OF THAT VAGUE LIGHT WHICH ISSUES IN
THE NIGHT TIME FROM THE PUPILS OF A CAT
THE CAPTAIN WAS BRAVE AND WOULD HAVE CARED VERY LITTLE FOR A
HIGHWAYMAN WITH A RAPIER IN HIS HAND
BUT THIS WALKING STATUE THIS
PETRIFIED MAN FROZE HIS BLOOD
THERE WERE THEN IN CIRCULATION STRANGE
STORIES OF A SURLY MONK A NOCTURNAL PROWLER ABOUT THE STREETS OF PARIS
AND THEY RECURRED CONFUSEDLY TO HIS MEMORY
HE REMAINED FOR SEVERAL
MINUTES IN STUPEFACTION AND FINALLY BROKE THE SILENCE WITH A FORCED
LAUGH
MONSIEUR IF YOU ARE A ROBBER AS I HOPE YOU ARE YOU PRODUCE UPON ME
THE EFFECT OF A HERON ATTACKING A NUTSHELL
I AM THE SON OF A RUINED
FAMILY MY DEAR FELLOW
TRY YOUR HAND NEAR BY HERE
IN THE CHAPEL OF
THIS COLLEGE THERE IS SOME WOOD OF THE TRUE CROSS SET IN SILVER
THE HAND OF THE SHADOW EMERGED FROM BENEATH ITS MANTLE AND DESCENDED
UPON THE ARM OF PHOEBUS WITH THE GRIP OF AN EAGLE'S TALON AT THE SAME
TIME THE SHADOW SPOKE
CAPTAIN PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS
WHAT THE DEVIL SAID PHOEBUS YOU KNOW MY NAME
I KNOW NOT YOUR NAME ALONE CONTINUED THE MAN IN THE MANTLE WITH HIS
SEPULCHRAL VOICE
YOU HAVE A RENDEZVOUS THIS EVENING
YES REPLIED PHOEBUS IN AMAZEMENT
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
AT LA FALOURDEL'S
PRECISELY
THE LEWD HAG OF THE PONT SAINT MICHEL
OF SAINT MICHEL THE ARCHANGEL AS THE PATER NOSTER SAITH
IMPIOUS WRETCH MUTTERED THE SPECTRE
WITH A WOMAN
CONFITEOR I CONFESS
WHO IS CALLED
LA SMERALDA SAID PHOEBUS GAYLY
ALL HIS HEEDLESSNESS HAD GRADUALLY
RETURNED
AT THIS NAME THE SHADOW'S GRASP SHOOK THE ARM OF PHOEBUS IN A FURY
CAPTAIN PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS THOU LIEST
ANY ONE WHO COULD HAVE BEHELD AT THAT MOMENT THE CAPTAIN'S INFLAMED
COUNTENANCE HIS LEAP BACKWARDS SO VIOLENT THAT HE DISENGAGED HIMSELF
FROM THE GRIP WHICH HELD HIM THE PROUD AIR WITH WHICH HE CLAPPED HIS
HAND ON HIS SWORDHILT AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS WRATH THE GLOOMY
IMMOBILITY OF THE MAN IN THE CLOAK ANY ONE WHO COULD HAVE BEHELD THIS
WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED
THERE WAS IN IT A TOUCH OF THE COMBAT OF DON
JUAN AND THE STATUE
CHRIST AND SATAN EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN
THAT IS A WORD WHICH RARELY
STRIKES THE EAR OF A CHTEAUPERS THOU WILT NOT DARE REPEAT IT
THOU LIEST SAID THE SHADOW COLDLY
THE CAPTAIN GNASHED HIS TEETH
SURLY MONK PHANTOM SUPERSTITIONS HE
HAD FORGOTTEN ALL AT THAT MOMENT
HE NO LONGER BEHELD ANYTHING BUT A
MAN AND AN INSULT
AH THIS IS WELL HE STAMMERED IN A VOICE STIFLED WITH RAGE
HE
DREW HIS SWORD THEN STAMMERING FOR ANGER AS WELL AS FEAR MAKES A
MAN TREMBLE HERE ON THE SPOT COME ON SWORDS SWORDS BLOOD ON THE
PAVEMENT
BUT THE OTHER NEVER STIRRED
WHEN HE BEHELD HIS ADVERSARY ON GUARD AND
READY TO PARRY
CAPTAIN PHOEBUS HE SAID AND HIS TONE VIBRATED WITH BITTERNESS YOU
FORGET YOUR APPOINTMENT
THE RAGES OF MEN LIKE PHOEBUS ARE MILK SOUPS WHOSE EBULLITION IS CALMED
BY A DROP OF COLD WATER
THIS SIMPLE REMARK CAUSED THE SWORD WHICH
GLITTERED IN THE CAPTAIN'S HAND TO BE LOWERED
CAPTAIN PURSUED THE MAN TO MORROW THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW A MONTH
HENCE TEN YEARS HENCE YOU WILL FIND ME READY TO CUT YOUR THROAT BUT
GO FIRST TO YOUR RENDEZVOUS
IN SOOTH SAID PHOEBUS AS THOUGH SEEKING TO CAPITULATE WITH HIMSELF
THESE ARE TWO CHARMING THINGS TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A RENDEZVOUS A
SWORD AND A WENCH BUT I DO NOT SEE WHY I SHOULD MISS THE ONE FOR THE
SAKE OF THE OTHER WHEN I CAN HAVE BOTH
HE REPLACED HIS SWORD IN ITS SCABBARD
GO TO YOUR RENDEZVOUS SAID THE MAN
MONSIEUR REPLIED PHOEBUS WITH SOME EMBARRASSMENT MANY THANKS FOR
YOUR COURTESY
IN FACT THERE WILL BE AMPLE TIME TO MORROW FOR US TO
CHOP UP FATHER ADAM'S DOUBLET INTO SLASHES AND BUTTONHOLES
I AM OBLIGED
TO YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PASS ONE MORE AGREEABLE QUARTER OF AN HOUR
I CERTAINLY DID HOPE TO PUT YOU IN THE GUTTER AND STILL ARRIVE IN TIME
FOR THE FAIR ONE ESPECIALLY AS IT HAS A BETTER APPEARANCE TO MAKE THE
WOMEN WAIT A LITTLE IN SUCH CASES
BUT YOU STRIKE ME AS HAVING THE AIR
OF A GALLANT MAN AND IT IS SAFER TO DEFER OUR AFFAIR UNTIL TO MORROW
SO I WILL BETAKE MYSELF TO MY RENDEZVOUS IT IS FOR SEVEN O'CLOCK AS
YOU KNOW HERE PHOEBUS SCRATCHED HIS EAR
AH
CORNE DIEU I HAD
FORGOTTEN I HAVEN'T A SOU TO DISCHARGE THE PRICE OF THE GARRET AND THE
OLD CRONE WILL INSIST ON BEING PAID IN ADVANCE
SHE DISTRUSTS ME
HERE IS THE WHEREWITHAL TO PAY
PHOEBUS FELT THE STRANGER'S COLD HAND SLIP INTO HIS A LARGE PIECE OF
MONEY
HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TAKING THE MONEY AND PRESSING THE HAND
VRAI DIEU HE EXCLAIMED YOU ARE A GOOD FELLOW
ONE CONDITION SAID THE MAN
PROVE TO ME THAT I HAVE BEEN WRONG AND
THAT YOU WERE SPEAKING THE TRUTH
HIDE ME IN SOME CORNER WHENCE I CAN
SEE WHETHER THIS WOMAN IS REALLY THE ONE WHOSE NAME YOU UTTERED
OH REPLIED PHOEBUS 'TIS ALL ONE TO ME
WE WILL TAKE THE
SAINTE MARTHE CHAMBER YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR EASE FROM THE KENNEL HARD
BY
COME THEN SAID THE SHADOW
AT YOUR SERVICE SAID THE CAPTAIN I KNOW NOT WHETHER YOU ARE
MESSER DIAVOLUS IN PERSON BUT LET US BE GOOD FRIENDS FOR THIS EVENING
TO MORROW I WILL REPAY YOU ALL MY DEBTS BOTH OF PURSE AND SWORD
THEY SET OUT AGAIN AT A RAPID PACE
AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES
THE SOUND OF THE RIVER ANNOUNCED TO THEM THAT THEY WERE ON THE PONT
SAINT MICHEL THEN LOADED WITH HOUSES
I WILL FIRST SHOW YOU THE WAY SAID PHOEBUS TO HIS COMPANION I
WILL THEN GO IN SEARCH OF THE FAIR ONE WHO IS AWAITING ME NEAR THE
PETIT CHTELET
HIS COMPANION MADE NO REPLY HE HAD NOT UTTERED A WORD SINCE THEY HAD
BEEN WALKING SIDE BY SIDE
PHOEBUS HALTED BEFORE A LOW DOOR AND KNOCKED
ROUGHLY A LIGHT MADE ITS APPEARANCE THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE DOOR
WHO IS THERE CRIED A TOOTHLESS VOICE
CORPS DIEU TTE DIEU VENTRE DIEU REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
THE DOOR OPENED INSTANTLY AND ALLOWED THE NEW CORNERS TO SEE AN OLD
WOMAN AND AN OLD LAMP BOTH OF WHICH TREMBLED
THE OLD WOMAN WAS BENT
DOUBLE CLAD IN TATTERS WITH A SHAKING HEAD PIERCED WITH TWO SMALL
EYES AND COIFFED WITH A DISH CLOUT WRINKLED EVERYWHERE ON HANDS AND
FACE AND NECK HER LIPS RETREATED UNDER HER GUMS AND ABOUT HER MOUTH
SHE HAD TUFTS OF WHITE HAIRS WHICH GAVE HER THE WHISKERED LOOK OF A CAT
THE INTERIOR OF THE DEN WAS NO LESS DILAPITATED THAN SHE THERE WERE
CHALK WALLS BLACKENED BEAMS IN THE CEILING A DISMANTLED CHIMNEY PIECE
SPIDERS' WEBS IN ALL THE CORNERS IN THE MIDDLE A STAGGERING HERD OF
TABLES AND LAME STOOLS A DIRTY CHILD AMONG THE ASHES AND AT THE BACK A
STAIRCASE OR RATHER A WOODEN LADDER WHICH ENDED IN A TRAP DOOR IN THE
CEILING
ON ENTERING THIS LAIR PHOEBUS'S MYSTERIOUS COMPANION RAISED HIS MANTLE
TO HIS VERY EYES
MEANWHILE THE CAPTAIN SWEARING LIKE A SARACEN
HASTENED TO MAKE THE SUN SHINE IN A CROWN AS SAITH OUR ADMIRABLE
RGNIER
THE SAINTE MARTHE CHAMBER SAID HE
THE OLD WOMAN ADDRESSED HIM AS MONSEIGNEUR AND SHUT UP THE CROWN IN A
DRAWER
IT WAS THE COIN WHICH THE MAN IN THE BLACK MANTLE HAD GIVEN TO
PHOEBUS
WHILE HER BACK WAS TURNED THE BUSHY HEADED AND RAGGED LITTLE
BOY WHO WAS PLAYING IN THE ASHES ADROITLY APPROACHED THE DRAWER
ABSTRACTED THE CROWN AND PUT IN ITS PLACE A DRY LEAF WHICH HE HAD
PLUCKED FROM A FAGOT
THE OLD CRONE MADE A SIGN TO THE TWO GENTLEMEN AS SHE CALLED THEM TO
FOLLOW HER AND MOUNTED THE LADDER IN ADVANCE OF THEM
ON ARRIVING AT
THE UPPER STORY SHE SET HER LAMP ON A COFFER AND PHOEBUS LIKE A
FREQUENT VISITOR OF THE HOUSE OPENED A DOOR WHICH OPENED ON A DARK
HOLE
ENTER HERE MY DEAR FELLOW HE SAID TO HIS COMPANION
THE MAN IN
THE MANTLE OBEYED WITHOUT A WORD IN REPLY THE DOOR CLOSED UPON HIM HE
HEARD PHOEBUS BOLT IT AND A MOMENT LATER DESCEND THE STAIRS AGAIN WITH
THE AGED HAG
THE LIGHT HAD DISAPPEARED
CHAPTER VIII
THE UTILITY OF WINDOWS WHICH OPEN ON THE RIVER
CLAUDE FROLLO FOR WE PRESUME THAT THE READER MORE INTELLIGENT THAN
PHOEBUS HAS SEEN IN THIS WHOLE ADVENTURE NO OTHER SURLY MONK THAN THE
ARCHDEACON CLAUDE FROLLO GROPED ABOUT FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS IN THE DARK
LAIR INTO WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD BOLTED HIM
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE NOOKS
WHICH ARCHITECTS SOMETIMES RESERVE AT THE POINT OF JUNCTION BETWEEN
THE ROOF AND THE SUPPORTING WALL
A VERTICAL SECTION OF THIS KENNEL AS
PHOEBUS HAD SO JUSTLY STYLED IT WOULD HAVE MADE A TRIANGLE
MOREOVER
THERE WAS NEITHER WINDOW NOR AIR HOLE AND THE SLOPE OF THE ROOF
PREVENTED ONE FROM STANDING UPRIGHT
ACCORDINGLY CLAUDE CROUCHED DOWN
IN THE DUST AND THE PLASTER WHICH CRACKED BENEATH HIM HIS HEAD WAS ON
FIRE RUMMAGING AROUND HIM WITH HIS HANDS HE FOUND ON THE FLOOR A
BIT OF BROKEN GLASS WHICH HE PRESSED TO HIS BROW AND WHOSE COOL NESS
AFFORDED HIM SOME RELIEF
WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE AT THAT MOMENT IN THE GLOOMY SOUL OF THE
ARCHDEACON GOD AND HIMSELF COULD ALONE KNOW
IN WHAT ORDER WAS HE ARRANGING IN HIS MIND LA ESMERALDA PHOEBUS
JACQUES CHARMOLUE HIS YOUNG BROTHER SO BELOVED YET ABANDONED BY HIM IN
THE MIRE HIS ARCHDEACON'S CASSOCK HIS REPUTATION PERHAPS DRAGGED TO LA
FALOURDEL'S ALL THESE ADVENTURES ALL THESE IMAGES I CANNOT SAY
BUT
IT IS CERTAIN THAT THESE IDEAS FORMED IN HIS MIND A HORRIBLE GROUP
HE HAD BEEN WAITING A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD
GROWN A CENTURY OLDER
ALL AT ONCE HE HEARD THE CREAKING OF THE BOARDS
OF THE STAIRWAY SOME ONE WAS ASCENDING
THE TRAPDOOR OPENED ONCE MORE
A LIGHT REAPPEARED
THERE WAS A TOLERABLY LARGE CRACK IN THE WORM EATEN
DOOR OF HIS DEN HE PUT HIS FACE TO IT
IN THIS MANNER HE COULD SEE
ALL THAT WENT ON IN THE ADJOINING ROOM
THE CAT FACED OLD CRONE WAS THE
FIRST TO EMERGE FROM THE TRAP DOOR LAMP IN HAND THEN PHOEBUS TWIRLING
HIS MOUSTACHE THEN A THIRD PERSON THAT BEAUTIFUL AND GRACEFUL FIGURE
LA ESMERALDA
THE PRIEST BEHELD HER RISE FROM BELOW LIKE A DAZZLING
APPARITION
CLAUDE TREMBLED A CLOUD SPREAD OVER HIS EYES HIS PULSES
BEAT VIOLENTLY EVERYTHING RUSTLED AND WHIRLED AROUND HIM HE NO LONGER
SAW NOR HEARD ANYTHING
WHEN HE RECOVERED HIMSELF PHOEBUS AND ESMERALDA WERE ALONE SEATED ON
THE WOODEN COFFER BESIDE THE LAMP WHICH MADE THESE TWO YOUTHFUL FIGURES
AND A MISERABLE PALLET AT THE END OF THE ATTIC STAND OUT PLAINLY BEFORE
THE ARCHDEACON'S EYES
BESIDE THE PALLET WAS A WINDOW WHOSE PANES BROKEN LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB
UPON WHICH RAIN HAS FALLEN ALLOWED A VIEW THROUGH ITS RENT MESHES OF
A CORNER OF THE SKY AND THE MOON LYING FAR AWAY ON AN EIDERDOWN BED OF
SOFT CLOUDS
THE YOUNG GIRL WAS BLUSHING CONFUSED PALPITATING
HER LONG DROOPING
LASHES SHADED HER CRIMSON CHEEKS
THE OFFICER TO WHOM SHE DARED
NOT LIFT HER EYES WAS RADIANT
MECHANICALLY AND WITH A CHARMINGLY
UNCONSCIOUS GESTURE SHE TRACED WITH THE TIP OF HER FINGER INCOHERENT
LINES ON THE BENCH AND WATCHED HER FINGER
HER FOOT WAS NOT VISIBLE
THE LITTLE GOAT WAS NESTLING UPON IT
THE CAPTAIN WAS VERY GALLANTLY CLAD HE HAD TUFTS OF EMBROIDERY AT HIS
NECK AND WRISTS A GREAT ELEGANCE AT THAT DAY
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THAT DOM CLAUDE MANAGED TO HEAR WHAT THEY
WERE SAYING THROUGH THE HUMMING OF THE BLOOD WHICH WAS BOILING IN HIS
TEMPLES
A CONVERSATION BETWEEN LOVERS IS A VERY COMMONPLACE AFFAIR
IT IS A
PERPETUAL I LOVE YOU A MUSICAL PHRASE WHICH IS VERY INSIPID AND VERY
BALD FOR INDIFFERENT LISTENERS WHEN IT IS NOT ORNAMENTED WITH SOME
FIORITURE BUT CLAUDE WAS NOT AN INDIFFERENT LISTENER
OH SAID THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT RAISING HER EYES DO NOT DESPISE ME
MONSEIGNEUR PHOEBUS
I FEEL THAT WHAT I AM DOING IS NOT RIGHT
DESPISE YOU MY PRETTY CHILD REPLIED THE OFFICER WITH AN AIR OF
SUPERIOR AND DISTINGUISHED GALLANTRY DESPISE YOU TTE DIEU AND
WHY
FOR HAVING FOLLOWED YOU
ON THAT POINT MY BEAUTY WE DON'T AGREE
I OUGHT NOT TO DESPISE YOU
BUT TO HATE YOU
THE YOUNG GIRL LOOKED AT HIM IN AFFRIGHT HATE ME WHAT HAVE I DONE
FOR HAVING REQUIRED SO MUCH URGING
ALAS SAID SHE 'TIS BECAUSE I AM BREAKING A VOW
I SHALL NOT FIND MY
PARENTS THE AMULET WILL LOSE ITS VIRTUE
BUT WHAT MATTERS IT WHAT NEED
HAVE I OF FATHER OR MOTHER NOW
SO SAYING SHE FIXED UPON THE CAPTAIN HER GREAT BLACK EYES MOIST WITH
JOY AND TENDERNESS
DEVIL TAKE ME IF I UNDERSTAND YOU EXCLAIMED PHOEBUS
LA ESMERALDA
REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT THEN A TEAR DROPPED FROM HER EYES A SIGH
FROM HER LIPS AND SHE SAID OH MONSEIGNEUR I LOVE YOU
SUCH A PERFUME OF CHASTITY SUCH A CHARM OF VIRTUE SURROUNDED THE YOUNG
GIRL THAT PHOEBUS DID NOT FEEL COMPLETELY AT HIS EASE BESIDE HER
BUT
THIS REMARK EMBOLDENED HIM YOU LOVE ME HE SAID WITH RAPTURE AND HE
THREW HIS ARM ROUND THE GYPSY'S WAIST
HE HAD ONLY BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
OPPORTUNITY
THE PRIEST SAW IT AND TESTED WITH THE TIP OF HIS FINGER THE POINT OF A
PONIARD WHICH HE WORE CONCEALED IN HIS BREAST
PHOEBUS CONTINUED THE BOHEMIAN GENTLY RELEASING HER WAIST FROM THE
CAPTAIN'S TENACIOUS HANDS YOU ARE GOOD YOU ARE GENEROUS YOU ARE
HANDSOME YOU SAVED ME ME WHO AM ONLY A POOR CHILD LOST IN BOHEMIA
I
HAD LONG BEEN DREAMING OF AN OFFICER WHO SHOULD SAVE MY LIFE
'TWAS OF
YOU THAT I WAS DREAMING BEFORE I KNEW YOU MY PHOEBUS THE OFFICER OF
MY DREAM HAD A BEAUTIFUL UNIFORM LIKE YOURS A GRAND LOOK A SWORD YOUR
NAME IS PHOEBUS 'TIS A BEAUTIFUL NAME
I LOVE YOUR NAME I LOVE YOUR
SWORD
DRAW YOUR SWORD PHOEBUS THAT I MAY SEE IT
CHILD SAID THE CAPTAIN AND HE UNSHEATHED HIS SWORD WITH A SMILE
THE GYPSY LOOKED AT THE HILT THE BLADE EXAMINED THE CIPHER ON THE
GUARD WITH ADORABLE CURIOSITY AND KISSED THE SWORD SAYING
YOU ARE THE SWORD OF A BRAVE MAN
I LOVE MY CAPTAIN PHOEBUS AGAIN
PROFITED BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPRESS UPON HER BEAUTIFUL BENT NECK A
KISS WHICH MADE THE YOUNG GIRL STRAIGHTEN HERSELF UP AS SCARLET AS A
POPPY
THE PRIEST GNASHED HIS TEETH OVER IT IN THE DARK
PHOEBUS RESUMED THE GYPSY LET ME TALK TO YOU
PRAY WALK A LITTLE
THAT I MAY SEE YOU AT FULL HEIGHT AND THAT I MAY HEAR YOUR SPURS
JINGLE
HOW HANDSOME YOU ARE
THE CAPTAIN ROSE TO PLEASE HER CHIDING HER WITH A SMILE OF
SATISFACTION
WHAT A CHILD YOU ARE BY THE WAY MY CHARMER HAVE YOU SEEN ME IN MY
ARCHER'S CEREMONIAL DOUBLET
ALAS NO SHE REPLIED
IT IS VERY HANDSOME
PHOEBUS RETURNED AND SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HER BUT MUCH CLOSER THAN
BEFORE
LISTEN MY DEAR
THE GYPSY GAVE HIM SEVERAL LITTLE TAPS WITH HER PRETTY HAND ON HIS
MOUTH WITH A CHILDISH MIRTH AND GRACE AND GAYETY
NO NO I WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU
DO YOU LOVE ME I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHETHER YOU LOVE ME
DO I LOVE THEE ANGEL OF MY LIFE EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN HALF
KNEELING
MY BODY MY BLOOD MY SOUL ALL ARE THINE ALL ARE FOR THEE
I LOVE THEE AND I HAVE NEVER LOVED ANY ONE BUT THEE
THE CAPTAIN HAD REPEATED THIS PHRASE SO MANY TIMES IN MANY SIMILAR
CONJUNCTURES THAT HE DELIVERED IT ALL IN ONE BREATH WITHOUT COMMITTING
A SINGLE MISTAKE
AT THIS PASSIONATE DECLARATION THE GYPSY RAISED TO
THE DIRTY CEILING WHICH SERVED FOR THE SKIES A GLANCE FULL OF ANGELIC
HAPPINESS
OH SHE MURMURED THIS IS THE MOMENT WHEN ONE SHOULD DIE
PHOEBUS FOUND THE MOMENT FAVORABLE FOR ROBBING HER OF ANOTHER KISS
WHICH WENT TO TORTURE THE UNHAPPY ARCHDEACON IN HIS NOOK
DIE
EXCLAIMED THE AMOROUS CAPTAIN WHAT ARE YOU SAYING MY LOVELY ANGEL
'TIS A TIME FOR LIVING OR JUPITER IS ONLY A SCAMP DIE AT THE BEGINNING
OF SO SWEET A THING CORNE DE BOEUF WHAT A JEST IT IS NOT THAT

THE JEALOUS GIRL INTERRUPTED HIM WHO

DEVIL NEPTUNUS SPEAR ME IF I DO NOT MAKE YOU THE HAPPIEST WOMAN IN THE
WORLD

ARCHERS PARADE BEFORE YOUR WINDOWS

A DEVILISH FINE ARRAY IN SHORT I WILL CONDUCT YOU TO SEE THE LIONS OF
THE HTEL DU ROI WHICH ARE WILD BEASTS
ALL WOMEN LOVE THAT
VARIETIES OF THE CROSSBOW
FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS THE YOUNG GIRL ABSORBED IN HER CHARMING THOUGHTS
WAS DREAMING TO THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE WITHOUT LISTENING TO THE SENSE
OF HIS WORDS
OH HOW HAPPY YOU WILL BE CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN AND AT THE SAME TIME
HE GENTLY UNBUCKLED THE GYPSY'S GIRDLE
WHAT ARE YOU DOING SHE SAID QUICKLY
THIS ACT OF VIOLENCE HAD
ROUSED HER FROM HER REVERY
NOTHING REPLIED PHOEBUS I WAS ONLY SAYING THAT YOU MUST ABANDON ALL
THIS GARB OF FOLLY AND THE STREET CORNER WHEN YOU ARE WITH ME
WHEN I AM WITH YOU PHOEBUS SAID THE YOUNG GIRL TENDERLY
SHE BECAME PENSIVE AND SILENT ONCE MORE
THE CAPTAIN EMBOLDENED BY HER GENTLENESS CLASPED HER WAIST WITHOUT
RESISTANCE THEN BEGAN SOFTLY TO UNLACE THE POOR CHILD'S CORSAGE AND
DISARRANGED HER TUCKER TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE PANTING PRIEST BEHELD
THE GYPSY'S BEAUTIFUL SHOULDER EMERGE FROM THE GAUZE AS ROUND AND BROWN
AS THE MOON RISING THROUGH THE MISTS OF THE HORIZON
THE YOUNG GIRL ALLOWED PHOEBUS TO HAVE HIS WAY
SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO
PERCEIVE IT
THE EYE OF THE BOLD CAPTAIN FLASHED
SUDDENLY SHE TURNED TOWARDS HIM
PHOEBUS SHE SAID WITH AN EXPRESSION OF INFINITE LOVE INSTRUCT ME
IN THY RELIGION
MY RELIGION EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN BURSTING WITH LAUGHTER I
INSTRUCT YOU IN MY RELIGION CORNE ET TONNERRE WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH
MY RELIGION
IN ORDER THAT WE MAY BE MARRIED SHE REPLIED
THE CAPTAIN'S FACE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND
DISDAIN OF CARELESSNESS AND LIBERTINE PASSION
AH BAH SAID HE DO PEOPLE MARRY
THE BOHEMIAN TURNED PALE AND HER HEAD DROOPED SADLY ON HER BREAST
MY BEAUTIFUL LOVE RESUMED PHOEBUS TENDERLY WHAT NONSENSE IS THIS
A GREAT THING IS MARRIAGE TRULY ONE IS NONE THE LESS LOVING FOR NOT
HAVING SPIT LATIN INTO A PRIEST'S SHOP
WHILE SPEAKING THUS IN HIS SOFTEST VOICE HE APPROACHED EXTREMELY NEAR
THE GYPSY HIS CARESSING HANDS RESUMED THEIR PLACE AROUND HER SUPPLE AND
DELICATE WAIST HIS EYE FLASHED MORE AND MORE AND EVERYTHING ANNOUNCED
THAT MONSIEUR PHOEBUS WAS ON THE VERGE OF ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHEN
JUPITER HIMSELF COMMITS SO MANY FOLLIES THAT HOMER IS OBLIGED TO SUMMON
A CLOUD TO HIS RESCUE
BUT DOM CLAUDE SAW EVERYTHING
THE DOOR WAS MADE OF THOROUGHLY ROTTEN
CASK STAVES WHICH LEFT LARGE APERTURES FOR THE PASSAGE OF HIS HAWKLIKE
GAZE
THIS BROWN SKINNED BROAD SHOULDERED PRIEST HITHERTO CONDEMNED TO
THE AUSTERE VIRGINITY OF THE CLOISTER WAS QUIVERING AND BOILING IN THE
PRESENCE OF THIS NIGHT SCENE OF LOVE AND VOLUPTUOUSNESS
THIS YOUNG
AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL GIVEN OVER IN DISARRAY TO THE ARDENT YOUNG MAN MADE
MELTED LEAD FLOW IN HIS VEINS HIS EYES DARTED WITH SENSUAL JEALOUSY
BENEATH ALL THOSE LOOSENED PINS
ANY ONE WHO COULD AT THAT MOMENT HAVE
SEEN THE FACE OF THE UNHAPPY MAN GLUED TO THE WORMEATEN BARS WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT HE BEHELD THE FACE OF A TIGER GLARING FROM THE DEPTHS OF
A CAGE AT SOME JACKAL DEVOURING A GAZELLE
HIS EYE SHONE LIKE A CANDLE
THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE DOOR
ALL AT ONCE PHOEBUS WITH A RAPID GESTURE REMOVED THE GYPSY'S
GORGERETTE
THE POOR CHILD WHO HAD REMAINED PALE AND DREAMY AWOKE
WITH A START SHE RECOILED HASTILY FROM THE ENTERPRISING OFFICER AND
CASTING A GLANCE AT HER BARE NECK AND SHOULDERS RED CONFUSED MUTE
WITH SHAME SHE CROSSED HER TWO BEAUTIFUL ARMS ON HER BREAST TO CONCEAL
IT
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE FLAME WHICH BURNED IN HER CHEEKS AT THE
SIGHT OF HER SO SILENT AND MOTIONLESS ONE WOULD HAVE DECLARED HER A
STATUE OF MODESTY
HER EYES WERE LOWERED
BUT THE CAPTAIN'S GESTURE HAD REVEALED THE MYSTERIOUS AMULET WHICH SHE
WORE ABOUT HER NECK
WHAT IS THAT HE SAID SEIZING THIS PRETEXT TO APPROACH ONCE MORE THE
BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WHOM HE HAD JUST ALARMED
DON'T TOUCH IT SHE REPLIED QUICKLY 'TIS MY GUARDIAN

OH LEAVE ME

GORGERETTE
PHOEBUS RETREATED AMID SAID IN A COLD TONE

SHE CLUNG TO THE CAPTAIN WHOM SHE DREW TO A SEAT BESIDE HER

SO SAYING SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND THE OFFICER'S NECK SHE LOOKED UP
AT HIM SUPPLICATINGLY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SMILE AND ALL IN TEARS
HER DELICATE NECK RUBBED AGAINST HIS CLOTH DOUBLET WITH ITS ROUGH
EMBROIDERIES
SHE WRITHED ON HER KNEES HER BEAUTIFUL BODY HALF NAKED
THE INTOXICATED CAPTAIN PRESSED HIS ARDENT LIPS TO THOSE LOVELY AFRICAN
SHOULDERS
THE YOUNG GIRL HER EYES BENT ON THE CEILING AS SHE LEANED
BACKWARDS QUIVERED ALL PALPITATING BENEATH THIS KISS
ALL AT ONCE ABOVE PHOEBUS'S HEAD SHE BEHELD ANOTHER HEAD A GREEN
LIVID CONVULSED FACE WITH THE LOOK OF A LOST SOUL NEAR THIS FACE WAS
A HAND GRASPING A PONIARD IT WAS THE FACE AND HAND OF THE PRIEST HE
HAD BROKEN THE DOOR AND HE WAS THERE
PHOEBUS COULD NOT SEE HIM
THE
YOUNG GIRL REMAINED MOTIONLESS FROZEN WITH TERROR DUMB BENEATH THAT
TERRIBLE APPARITION LIKE A DOVE WHICH SHOULD RAISE ITS HEAD AT THE
MOMENT WHEN THE HAWK IS GAZING INTO HER NEST WITH ITS ROUND EYES
SHE COULD NOT EVEN UTTER A CRY
SHE SAW THE PONIARD DESCEND UPON
PHOEBUS AND RISE AGAIN REEKING
MALEDICTIONS SAID THE CAPTAIN AND FELL
SHE FAINTED
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HER EYES CLOSED WHEN ALL FEELING VANISHED IN HER
SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE FELT A TOUCH OF FIRE IMPRINTED UPON HER LIPS A
KISS MORE BURNING THAN THE RED HOT IRON OF THE EXECUTIONER
WHEN SHE RECOVERED HER SENSES SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS OF THE
WATCH THEY WERE CARRYING AWAY THE CAPTAIN BATHED IN HIS BLOOD THE
PRIEST HAD DISAPPEARED THE WINDOW AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM WHICH OPENED
ON THE RIVER WAS WIDE OPEN THEY PICKED UP A CLOAK WHICH THEY SUPPOSED
TO BELONG TO THE OFFICER AND SHE HEARD THEM SAYING AROUND HER
'TIS A SORCERESS WHO HAS STABBED A CAPTAIN
BOOK EIGHTH
CHAPTER I
THE CROWN CHANGED INTO A DRY LEAF
GRINGOIRE AND THE ENTIRE COURT OF MIRACLES WERE SUFFERING MORTAL
ANXIETY
FOR A WHOLE MONTH THEY HAD NOT KNOWN WHAT HAD BECOME OF LA
ESMERALDA WHICH GREATLY PAINED THE DUKE OF EGYPT AND HIS FRIENDS THE
VAGABONDS NOR WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE GOAT WHICH REDOUBLED GRINGOIRE'S
GRIEF
ONE EVENING THE GYPSY HAD DISAPPEARED AND SINCE THAT TIME HAD
GIVEN NO SIGNS OF LIFE
ALL SEARCH HAD PROVED FRUITLESS
SOME TORMENTING
BOOTBLACKS HAD TOLD GRINGOIRE ABOUT MEETING HER THAT SAME EVENING NEAR
THE PONT SAINT MICHEL GOING OFF WITH AN OFFICER BUT THIS HUSBAND
AFTER THE FASHION OF BOHEMIA WAS AN INCREDULOUS PHILOSOPHER AND
BESIDES HE BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE KNEW TO WHAT A POINT HIS WIFE WAS
VIRGINAL
HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FORM A JUDGMENT AS TO THE UNCONQUERABLE
MODESTY RESULTING FROM THE COMBINED VIRTUES OF THE AMULET AND THE GYPSY
AND HE HAD MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATED THE RESISTANCE OF THAT CHASTITY TO
THE SECOND POWER
ACCORDINGLY HE WAS AT EASE ON THAT SCORE
STILL HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THIS DISAPPEARANCE
IT WAS A PROFOUND
SORROW
HE WOULD HAVE GROWN THIN OVER IT HAD THAT BEEN POSSIBLE
HE HAD
FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING EVEN HIS LITERARY TASTES EVEN HIS GREAT WORK
DE FIGURIS REGULARIBUS ET IRREGULARIBUS WHICH IT WAS HIS INTENTION
TO HAVE PRINTED WITH THE FIRST MONEY WHICH HE SHOULD PROCURE FOR HE HAD
RAVED OVER PRINTING EVER SINCE HE HAD SEEN THE DIDASCALON OF HUGUES
DE SAINT VICTOR PRINTED WITH THE CELEBRATED CHARACTERS OF VINDELIN DE
SPIRE
ONE DAY AS HE WAS PASSING SADLY BEFORE THE CRIMINAL TOURNELLE HE
PERCEIVED A CONSIDERABLE CROWD AT ONE OF THE GATES OF THE PALAIS DE
JUSTICE
WHAT IS THIS HE INQUIRED OF A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS COMING OUT
I KNOW NOT SIR REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN
'TIS SAID THAT THEY ARE
TRYING A WOMAN WHO HATH ASSASSINATED A GENDARME
IT APPEARS THAT THERE
IS SORCERY AT THE BOTTOM OF IT THE ARCHBISHOP AND THE OFFICIAL HAVE
INTERVENED IN THE CASE AND MY BROTHER WHO IS THE ARCHDEACON OF JOSAS
CAN THINK OF NOTHING ELSE
NOW I WISHED TO SPEAK WITH HIM BUT I
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH HIM BECAUSE OF THE THRONG WHICH VEXES ME
GREATLY AS I STAND IN NEED OF MONEY
ALAS SIR SAID GRINGOIRE I WOULD THAT I COULD LEND YOU SOME BUT
MY BREECHES ARE WORN TO HOLES AND 'TIS NOT CROWNS WHICH HAVE DONE IT
HE DARED NOT TELL THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH HIS BROTHER
THE ARCHDEACON TO WHOM HE HAD NOT RETURNED AFTER THE SCENE IN THE
CHURCH A NEGLIGENCE WHICH EMBARRASSED HIM
THE SCHOLAR WENT HIS WAY AND GRINGOIRE SET OUT TO FOLLOW THE CROWD
WHICH WAS MOUNTING THE STAIRCASE OF THE GREAT CHAMBER
IN HIS OPINION
THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE THE SPECTACLE OF A CRIMINAL PROCESS FOR
DISSIPATING MELANCHOLY SO EXHILARATINGLY STUPID ARE JUDGES AS A RULE
THE POPULACE WHICH HE HAD JOINED WALKED AND ELBOWED IN SILENCE
AFTER
A SLOW AND TIRESOME MARCH THROUGH A LONG GLOOMY CORRIDOR WHICH
WOUND THROUGH THE COURT HOUSE LIKE THE INTESTINAL CANAL OF THE ANCIENT
EDIFICE HE ARRIVED NEAR A LOW DOOR OPENING UPON A HALL WHICH HIS LOFTY
STATURE PERMITTED HIM TO SURVEY WITH A GLANCE OVER THE WAVING HEADS OF
THE RABBLE
THE HALL WAS VAST AND GLOOMY WHICH LATTER FACT MADE IT APPEAR STILL
MORE SPACIOUS
THE DAY WAS DECLINING THE LONG POINTED WINDOWS
PERMITTED ONLY A PALE RAY OF LIGHT TO ENTER WHICH WAS EXTINGUISHED
BEFORE IT REACHED THE VAULTED CEILING AN ENORMOUS TRELLIS WORK OF
SCULPTURED BEAMS WHOSE THOUSAND FIGURES SEEMED TO MOVE CONFUSEDLY IN
THE SHADOWS MANY CANDLES WERE ALREADY LIGHTED HERE AND THERE ON TABLES
AND BEAMING ON THE HEADS OF CLERKS BURIED IN MASSES OF DOCUMENTS
THE
ANTERIOR PORTION OF THE BALL WAS OCCUPIED BY THE CROWD ON THE RIGHT AND
LEFT WERE MAGISTRATES AND TABLES AT THE END UPON A PLATFORM A
NUMBER OF JUDGES WHOSE REAR RANK SANK INTO THE SHADOWS SINISTER AND
MOTIONLESS FACES
THE WALLS WERE SOWN WITH INNUMERABLE FLEURS DE LIS
A
LARGE FIGURE OF CHRIST MIGHT BE VAGUELY DESCRIED ABOVE THE JUDGES
AND EVERYWHERE THERE WERE PIKES AND HALBERDS UPON WHOSE POINTS THE
REFLECTION OF THE CANDLES PLACED TIPS OF FIRE
MONSIEUR GRINGOIRE INQUIRED OF ONE OF HIS NEIGHBORS WHO ARE ALL
THOSE PERSONS RANGED YONDER LIKE PRELATES IN COUNCIL
MONSIEUR REPLIED THE NEIGHBOR THOSE ON THE RIGHT ARE THE
COUNSELLORS OF THE GRAND CHAMBER THOSE ON THE LEFT THE COUNCILLORS OF
INQUIRY THE MASTERS IN BLACK GOWNS THE MESSIRES IN RED
WHO IS THAT BIG RED FELLOW YONDER ABOVE THEM WHO IS SWEATING
PURSUED GRINGOIRE
IT IS MONSIEUR THE PRESIDENT
AND THOSE SHEEP BEHIND HIM CONTINUED GRINGOIRE WHO AS WE HAVE SEEN
DID NOT LOVE THE MAGISTRACY WHICH AROSE POSSIBLY FROM THE GRUDGE
WHICH HE CHERISHED AGAINST THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE SINCE HIS DRAMATIC
MISADVENTURE
THEY ARE MESSIEURS THE MASTERS OF REQUESTS OF THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD
AND THAT BOAR IN FRONT OF HIM
HE IS MONSIEUR THE CLERK OF THE COURT OF PARLIAMENT
AND THAT CROCODILE ON THE RIGHT
MASTER PHILIPPE LHEULIER ADVOCATE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE KING
AND THAT BIG BLACK TOM CAT ON THE LEFT
MASTER JACQUES CHARMOLUE PROCURATOR OF THE KING IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL
COURT WITH THE GENTLEMEN OF THE OFFICIALTY
COME NOW MONSIEUR SAID GRINGOIRE PRAY WHAT ARE ALL THOSE FINE
FELLOWS DOING YONDER
THEY ARE JUDGING
JUDGING WHOM I DO NOT SEE THE ACCUSED
'TIS A WOMAN SIR
YOU CANNOT SEE HER
SHE HAS HER BACK TURNED TO US
AND SHE IS HIDDEN FROM US BY THE CROWD
STAY YONDER SHE IS WHERE YOU
SEE A GROUP OF PARTISANS
WHO IS THE WOMAN ASKED GRINGOIRE
DO YOU KNOW HER NAME
NO MONSIEUR I HAVE BUT JUST ARRIVED
I MERELY ASSUME THAT THERE IS
SOME SORCERY ABOUT IT SINCE THE OFFICIAL IS PRESENT AT THE TRIAL
COME SAID OUR PHILOSOPHER WE ARE GOING TO SEE ALL THESE MAGISTRATES
DEVOUR HUMAN FLESH
'TIS AS GOOD A SPECTACLE AS ANY OTHER
MONSIEUR REMARKED HIS NEIGHBOR THINK YOU NOT THAT MASTER JACQUES
CHARMOLUE HAS A VERY SWEET AIR
HUM REPLIED GRINGOIRE
I DISTRUST A SWEETNESS WHICH HATH PINCHED
NOSTRILS AND THIN LIPS
HERE THE BYSTANDERS IMPOSED SILENCE UPON THE TWO CHATTERERS
THEY WERE
LISTENING TO AN IMPORTANT DEPOSITION
MESSEIGNEURS SAID AN OLD WOMAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL WHOSE FORM
WAS SO CONCEALED BENEATH HER GARMENTS THAT ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HER
A WALKING HEAP OF RAGS MESSEIGNEURS THE THING IS AS TRUE AS THAT I
AM LA FALOURDEL ESTABLISHED THESE FORTY YEARS AT THE PONT SAINT MICHEL
AND PAYING REGULARLY MY RENTS LORD'S DUES AND QUIT RENTS AT THE GATE
OPPOSITE THE HOUSE OF TASSIN CAILLART THE DYER WHICH IS ON THE SIDE
UP THE RIVER A POOR OLD WOMAN NOW BUT A PRETTY MAID IN FORMER DAYS
MY LORDS
SOME ONE SAID TO ME LATELY 'LA FALOURDEL DON'T USE YOUR
SPINNING WHEEL TOO MUCH IN THE EVENING THE DEVIL IS FOND OF COMBING THE
DISTAFFS OF OLD WOMEN WITH HIS HORNS
'TIS CERTAIN THAT THE SURLY MONK
WHO WAS ROUND ABOUT THE TEMPLE LAST YEAR NOW PROWLS IN THE CITY
TAKE
CARE LA FALOURDEL THAT HE DOTH NOT KNOCK AT YOUR DOOR ONE EVENING I
WAS SPINNING ON MY WHEEL THERE COMES A KNOCK AT MY DOOR I ASK WHO IT
IS
THEY SWEAR
I OPEN
TWO MEN ENTER
A MAN IN BLACK AND A HANDSOME
OFFICER
OF THE BLACK MAN NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT HIS EYES TWO
COALS OF FIRE
ALL THE REST WAS HAT AND CLOAK
THEY SAY TO ME 'THE
SAINTE MARTHE CHAMBER 'TIS MY UPPER CHAMBER MY LORDS MY CLEANEST
THEY GIVE ME A CROWN
I PUT THE CROWN IN MY DRAWER AND I SAY 'THIS
SHALL GO TO BUY TRIPE AT THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE OF LA GLORIETTE TO MORROW
WE GO UP STAIRS
ON ARRIVING AT THE UPPER CHAMBER AND WHILE MY BACK IS
TURNED THE BLACK MAN DISAPPEARS
THAT DAZED ME A BIT
THE OFFICER WHO
WAS AS HANDSOME AS A GREAT LORD GOES DOWN STAIRS AGAIN WITH ME
HE GOES
OUT
IN ABOUT THE TIME IT TAKES TO SPIN A QUARTER OF A HANDFUL OF FLAX
HE RETURNS WITH A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL A DOLL WHO WOULD HAVE SHONE LIKE
THE SUN HAD SHE BEEN COIFFED
SHE HAD WITH HER A GOAT A BIG BILLY GOAT
WHETHER BLACK OR WHITE I NO LONGER REMEMBER
THAT SET ME TO THINKING
THE GIRL DOES NOT CONCERN ME BUT THE GOAT I LOVE NOT THOSE BEASTS
THEY HAVE A BEARD AND HORNS
THEY ARE SO LIKE A MAN
AND THEN THEY
SMACK OF THE WITCHES SABBATH
HOWEVER I SAY NOTHING
I HAD THE CROWN
THAT IS RIGHT IS IT NOT MONSIEUR JUDGE I SHOW THE CAPTAIN AND THE
WENCH TO THE UPPER CHAMBER AND I LEAVE THEM ALONE THAT IS TO SAY WITH
THE GOAT
I GO DOWN AND SET TO SPINNING AGAIN I MUST INFORM YOU THAT
MY HOUSE HAS A GROUND FLOOR AND STORY ABOVE
I KNOW NOT WHY I FELL TO
THINKING OF THE SURLY MONK WHOM THE GOAT HAD PUT INTO MY HEAD AGAIN AND
THEN THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL WAS RATHER STRANGELY DECKED OUT
ALL AT ONCE
I HEAR A CRY UPSTAIRS AND SOMETHING FALLS ON THE FLOOR AND THE WINDOW
OPENS
I RUN TO MINE WHICH IS BENEATH IT AND I BEHOLD A BLACK MASS PASS
BEFORE MY EYES AND FALL INTO THE WATER
IT WAS A PHANTOM CLAD LIKE
A PRIEST
IT WAS A MOONLIGHT NIGHT
I SAW HIM QUITE PLAINLY
HE WAS
SWIMMING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY
THEN ALL OF A TREMBLE I CALL
THE WATCH
THE GENTLEMEN OF THE POLICE ENTER AND NOT KNOWING JUST AT
THE FIRST MOMENT WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND BEING MERRY THEY BEAT ME
I
EXPLAIN TO THEM
WE GO UP STAIRS AND WHAT DO WE FIND MY POOR CHAMBER
ALL BLOOD THE CAPTAIN STRETCHED OUT AT FULL LENGTH WITH A DAGGER IN
HIS NECK THE GIRL PRETENDING TO BE DEAD AND THE GOAT ALL IN A FRIGHT
'PRETTY WORK I SAY 'I SHALL HAVE TO WASH THAT FLOOR FOR MORE THAN A
FORTNIGHT
IT WILL HAVE TO BE SCRAPED IT WILL BE A TERRIBLE JOB THEY
CARRIED OFF THE OFFICER POOR YOUNG MAN AND THE WENCH WITH HER BOSOM
ALL BARE
BUT WAIT THE WORST IS THAT ON THE NEXT DAY WHEN I WANTED TO
TAKE THE CROWN TO BUY TRIPE I FOUND A DEAD LEAF IN ITS PLACE
THE OLD WOMAN CEASED
A MURMUR OF HORROR RAN THROUGH THE AUDIENCE
THAT PHANTOM THAT GOAT ALL SMACKS OF MAGIC SAID ONE OF GRINGOIRE'S
NEIGHBORS
AND THAT DRY LEAF ADDED ANOTHER
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT JOINED IN A THIRD SHE IS A WITCH WHO HAS DEALINGS
WITH THE SURLY MONK FOR THE PURPOSE OF PLUNDERING OFFICERS
GRINGOIRE HIMSELF WAS NOT DISINCLINED TO REGARD THIS AS ALTOGETHER
ALARMING AND PROBABLE
GOODY FALOURDEL SAID THE PRESIDENT MAJESTICALLY HAVE YOU NOTHING
MORE TO COMMUNICATE TO THE COURT
NO MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED THE CRONE EXCEPT THAT THE REPORT HAS
DESCRIBED MY HOUSE AS A HOVEL AND STINKING WHICH IS AN OUTRAGEOUS
FASHION OF SPEAKING
THE HOUSES ON THE BRIDGE ARE NOT IMPOSING BECAUSE
THERE ARE SUCH MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE BUT NEVERTHELESS THE BUTCHERS
CONTINUE TO DWELL THERE WHO ARE WEALTHY FOLK AND MARRIED TO VERY
PROPER AND HANDSOME WOMEN
THE MAGISTRATE WHO HAD REMINDED GRINGOIRE OF A CROCODILE ROSE
SILENCE SAID HE
I PRAY THE GENTLEMEN NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT
THAT A DAGGER WAS FOUND ON THE PERSON OF THE ACCUSED
GOODY FALOURDEL
HAVE YOU BROUGHT THAT LEAF INTO WHICH THE CROWN WHICH THE DEMON GAVE YOU
WAS TRANSFORMED
YES MONSEIGNEUR SHE REPLIED I FOUND IT AGAIN
HERE IT IS
A BAILIFF BANDED THE DEAD LEAF TO THE CROCODILE WHO MADE A DOLEFUL
SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND PASSED IT ON TO THE PRESIDENT WHO GAVE IT TO THE
PROCURATOR OF THE KING IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL COURT AND THUS IT MADE THE
CIRCUIT OF THE HAIL
IT IS A BIRCH LEAF SAID MASTER JACQUES CHARMOLUE
A FRESH PROOF OF
MAGIC
A COUNSELLOR TOOK UP THE WORD
WITNESS TWO MEN WENT UPSTAIRS TOGETHER IN YOUR HOUSE THE BLACK MAN
WHOM YOU FIRST SAW DISAPPEAR AND AFTERWARDS SWIMMING IN THE SEINE WITH
HIS PRIESTLY GARMENTS AND THE OFFICER
WHICH OF THE TWO HANDED YOU
THE CROWN THE OLD WOMAN PONDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID THE
OFFICER
A MURMUR RAN THROUGH THE CROWD
AH THOUGHT GRINGOIRE THIS MAKES SOME DOUBT IN MY MIND
BUT MASTER PHILIPPE LHEULIER ADVOCATE EXTRAORDINARY TO THE KING
INTERPOSED ONCE MORE
I WILL RECALL TO THESE GENTLEMEN THAT IN THE DEPOSITION TAKEN AT HIS
BEDSIDE THE ASSASSINATED OFFICER WHILE DECLARING THAT HE HAD A VAGUE
IDEA WHEN THE BLACK MAN ACCOSTED HIM THAT THE LATTER MIGHT BE THE SURLY
MONK ADDED THAT THE PHANTOM HAD PRESSED HIM EAGERLY TO GO AND MAKE
ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ACCUSED AND UPON HIS THE CAPTAIN'S REMARKING
THAT HE HAD NO MONEY HE HAD GIVEN HIM THE CROWN WHICH THE SAID OFFICER
PAID TO LA FALOURDEL
HENCE THAT CROWN IS THE MONEY OF HELL
THIS CONCLUSIVE OBSERVATION APPEARED TO DISSIPATE ALL THE DOUBTS OF
GRINGOIRE AND THE OTHER SCEPTICS IN THE AUDIENCE
YOU HAVE THE DOCUMENTS GENTLEMEN ADDED THE KING'S ADVOCATE AS
HE TOOK HIS SEAT YOU CAN CONSULT THE TESTIMONY OF PHOEBUS DE
CHTEAUPERS
AT THAT NAME THE ACCUSED SPRANG UP HER HEAD ROSE ABOVE THE THRONG
GRINGOIRE WITH HORROR RECOGNIZED LA ESMERALDA
SHE WAS PALE HER TRESSES FORMERLY SO GRACEFULLY BRAIDED AND SPANGLED
WITH SEQUINS HUNG IN DISORDER HER LIPS WERE BLUE HER HOLLOW EYES WERE
TERRIBLE
ALAS
PHOEBUS SHE SAID IN BEWILDERMENT WHERE IS HE O MESSEIGNEURS
BEFORE YOU KILL ME TELL ME FOR PITY SAKE WHETHER HE STILL LIVES
HOLD YOUR TONGUE WOMAN REPLIED THE PRESIDENT THAT IS NO AFFAIR OF
OURS
OH FOR MERCY'S SAKE TELL ME IF HE IS ALIVE SHE REPEATED CLASPING
HER BEAUTIFUL EMACIATED HANDS AND THE SOUND OF HER CHAINS IN CONTACT
WITH HER DRESS WAS HEARD
WELL SAID THE KING'S ADVOCATE ROUGHLY HE IS DYING
ARE YOU
SATISFIED
THE UNHAPPY GIRL FELL BACK ON HER CRIMINAL'S SEAT SPEECHLESS TEARLESS
WHITE AS A WAX FIGURE
THE PRESIDENT BENT DOWN TO A MAN AT HIS FEET WHO WORE A GOLD CAP AND A
BLACK GOWN A CHAIN ON HIS NECK AND A WAND IN HIS HAND
BAILIFF BRING IN THE SECOND ACCUSED
ALL EYES TURNED TOWARDS A SMALL DOOR WHICH OPENED AND TO THE GREAT
AGITATION OF GRINGOIRE GAVE PASSAGE TO A PRETTY GOAT WITH HORNS AND
HOOFS OF GOLD
THE ELEGANT BEAST HALTED FOR A MOMENT ON THE THRESHOLD
STRETCHING OUT ITS NECK AS THOUGH PERCHED ON THE SUMMIT OF A ROCK IT
HAD BEFORE ITS EYES AN IMMENSE HORIZON
SUDDENLY IT CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE
GYPSY GIRL AND LEAPING OVER THE TABLE AND THE HEAD OF A CLERK IN TWO
BOUNDS IT WAS AT HER KNEES THEN IT ROLLED GRACEFULLY ON ITS MISTRESS'S
FEET SOLICITING A WORD OR A CARESS BUT THE ACCUSED REMAINED
MOTIONLESS AND POOR DJALI HIMSELF OBTAINED NOT A GLANCE
EH WHY 'TIS MY VILLANOUS BEAST SAID OLD FALOURDEL I RECOGNIZE THE
TWO PERFECTLY
JACQUES CHARMOLUE INTERFERED
IF THE GENTLEMEN PLEASE WE WILL PROCEED TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE
GOAT HE WAS IN FACT THE SECOND CRIMINAL
NOTHING MORE SIMPLE IN
THOSE DAYS THAN A SUIT OF SORCERY INSTITUTED AGAINST AN ANIMAL
WE FIND
AMONG OTHERS IN THE ACCOUNTS OF THE PROVOST'S OFFICE FOR 1466 A CURIOUS
DETAIL CONCERNING THE EXPENSES OF THE TRIAL OF GILLET SOULART AND HIS
SOW EXECUTED FOR THEIR DEMERITS AT CORBEIL
EVERYTHING IS THERE THE
COST OF THE PENS IN WHICH TO PLACE THE SOW THE FIVE HUNDRED BUNDLES OF
BRUSHWOOD PURCHASED AT THE PORT OF MORSANT THE THREE PINTS OF WINE
AND THE BREAD THE LAST REPAST OF THE VICTIM FRATERNALLY SHARED BY THE
EXECUTIONER DOWN TO THE ELEVEN DAYS OF GUARD AND FOOD FOR THE SOW
AT EIGHT DENIERS PARISIS EACH
SOMETIMES THEY WENT EVEN FURTHER THAN
ANIMALS
THE CAPITULARIES OF CHARLEMAGNE AND OF LOUIS LE DBONNAIRE
IMPOSE SEVERE PENALTIES ON FIERY PHANTOMS WHICH PRESUME TO APPEAR IN THE
AIR
MEANWHILE THE PROCURATOR HAD EXCLAIMED IF THE DEMON WHICH POSSESSES
THIS GOAT AND WHICH HAS RESISTED ALL EXORCISMS PERSISTS IN ITS DEEDS
OF WITCHCRAFT IF IT ALARMS THE COURT WITH THEM WE WARN IT THAT WE
SHALL BE FORCED TO PUT IN REQUISITION AGAINST IT THE GALLOWS OR THE
STAKE
GRINGOIRE BROKE OUT INTO A COLD PERSPIRATION
CHARMOLUE TOOK FROM
THE TABLE THE GYPSY'S TAMBOURINE AND PRESENTING IT TO THE GOAT IN A
CERTAIN MANNER ASKED THE LATTER
WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT
THE GOAT LOOKED AT IT WITH AN INTELLIGENT EYE RAISED ITS GILDED HOOF
AND STRUCK SEVEN BLOWS
IT WAS IN FACT SEVEN O'CLOCK
A MOVEMENT OF TERROR RAN THROUGH THE
CROWD
GRINGOIRE COULD NOT ENDURE IT
HE IS DESTROYING HIMSELF HE CRIED ALOUD YOU SEE WELL THAT HE DOES
NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING
SILENCE AMONG THE LOUTS AT THE END OF THE HAIL SAID THE BAILIFF
SHARPLY
JACQUES CHARMOLUE BY THE AID OF THE SAME MANOEUVRES OF THE TAMBOURINE
MADE THE GOAT PERFORM MANY OTHER TRICKS CONNECTED WITH THE DATE OF
THE DAY THE MONTH OF THE YEAR ETC WHICH THE READER HAS ALREADY
WITNESSED
AND BY VIRTUE OF AN OPTICAL ILLUSION PECULIAR TO JUDICIAL
PROCEEDINGS THESE SAME SPECTATORS WHO HAD PROBABLY MORE THAN ONCE
APPLAUDED IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE DJALI'S INNOCENT MAGIC WERE TERRIFIED BY
IT BENEATH THE ROOF OF THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE
THE GOAT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY
THE DEVIL
IT WAS FAR WORSE WHEN THE PROCURATOR OF THE KING HAVING EMPTIED UPON A
FLOOR A CERTAIN BAG FILLED WITH MOVABLE LETTERS WHICH DJALI WORE ROUND
HIS NECK THEY BEHELD THE GOAT EXTRACT WITH HIS HOOF FROM THE SCATTERED
ALPHABET THE FATAL NAME OF PHOEBUS
THE WITCHCRAFT OF WHICH THE CAPTAIN
HAD BEEN THE VICTIM APPEARED IRRESISTIBLY DEMONSTRATED AND IN THE EYES
OF ALL THE GYPSY THAT RAVISHING DANCER WHO HAD SO OFTEN DAZZLED
THE PASSERS BY WITH HER GRACE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT A FRIGHTFUL
VAMPIRE
HOWEVER SHE BETRAYED NO SIGN OF LIFE NEITHER DJALI'S GRACEFUL
EVOLUTIONS NOR THE MENACES OF THE COURT NOR THE SUPPRESSED
IMPRECATIONS OF THE SPECTATORS ANY LONGER REACHED HER MIND
IN ORDER TO AROUSE HER A POLICE OFFICER WAS OBLIGED TO SHAKE HER
UNMERCIFULLY AND THE PRESIDENT HAD TO RAISE HIS VOICE GIRL YOU
ARE OF THE BOHEMIAN RACE ADDICTED TO DEEDS OF WITCHCRAFT
YOU IN
COMPLICITY WITH THE BEWITCHED GOAT IMPLICATED IN THIS SUIT DURING
THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTY NINTH OF MARCH LAST MURDERED AND STABBED IN
CONCERT WITH THE POWERS OF DARKNESS BY THE AID OF CHARMS AND UNDERHAND
PRACTICES A CAPTAIN OF THE KING'S ARCHES OF THE WATCH PHOEBUS DE
CHTEAUPERS
DO YOU PERSIST IN DENYING IT
HORROR EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG GIRL HIDING HER FACE IN HER HANDS
MY
PHOEBUS OH THIS IS HELL
DO YOU PERSIST IN YOUR DENIAL DEMANDED THE PRESIDENT COLDLY
DO I DENY IT SHE SAID WITH TERRIBLE ACCENTS AND SHE ROSE WITH
FLASHING EYES
THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED SQUARELY
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE FACTS LAID TO YOUR CHARGE
SHE REPLIED IN A BROKEN VOICE
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU
I DO NOT KNOW
'TWAS A PRIEST A PRIEST WHOM I
DO NOT KNOW AN INFERNAL PRIEST WHO PURSUES ME
THAT IS IT RETORTED THE JUDGE THE SURLY MONK
OH GENTLEMEN HAVE MERCY I AM BUT A POOR GIRL
OF EGYPT SAID THE JUDGE
MASTER JACQUES CHARMOLUE INTERPOSED SWEETLY
IN VIEW OF THE SAD OBSTINACY OF THE ACCUSED I DEMAND THE APPLICATION
OF THE TORTURE
GRANTED SAID THE PRESIDENT
THE UNHAPPY GIRL QUIVERED IN EVERY LIMB
BUT SHE ROSE AT THE COMMAND OF
THE MEN WITH PARTISANS AND WALKED WITH A TOLERABLY FIRM STEP PRECEDED
BY CHARMOLUE AND THE PRIESTS OF THE OFFICIALITY BETWEEN TWO ROWS OF
HALBERDS TOWARDS A MEDIUM SIZED DOOR WHICH SUDDENLY OPENED AND CLOSED
AGAIN BEHIND HER AND WHICH PRODUCED UPON THE GRIEF STRICKEN GRINGOIRE
THE EFFECT OF A HORRIBLE MOUTH WHICH HAD JUST DEVOURED HER
WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED THEY HEARD A PLAINTIVE BLEATING IT WAS THE LITTLE
GOAT MOURNING
THE SITTING OF THE COURT WAS SUSPENDED
A COUNSELLOR HAVING REMARKED
THAT THE GENTLEMEN WERE FATIGUED AND THAT IT WOULD BE A LONG TIME
TO WAIT UNTIL THE TORTURE WAS AT AN END THE PRESIDENT REPLIED THAT A
MAGISTRATE MUST KNOW HOW TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF TO HIS DUTY
WHAT AN ANNOYING AND VEXATIOUS HUSSY SAID AN AGED JUDGE TO GET
HERSELF PUT TO THE QUESTION WHEN ONE HAS NOT SUPPED
CHAPTER II
CONTINUATION OF THE CROWN WHICH WAS CHANGED INTO A DRY LEAF
AFTER ASCENDING AND DESCENDING SEVERAL STEPS IN THE CORRIDORS WHICH
WERE SO DARK THAT THEY WERE LIGHTED BY LAMPS AT MID DAY LA ESMERALDA
STILL SURROUNDED BY HER LUGUBRIOUS ESCORT WAS THRUST BY THE POLICE INTO
A GLOOMY CHAMBER
THIS CHAMBER CIRCULAR IN FORM OCCUPIED THE GROUND
FLOOR OF ONE OF THOSE GREAT TOWERS WHICH EVEN IN OUR OWN CENTURY
STILL PIERCE THROUGH THE LAYER OF MODERN EDIFICES WITH WHICH MODERN
PARIS HAS COVERED ANCIENT PARIS
THERE WERE NO WINDOWS TO THIS CELLAR
NO OTHER OPENING THAN THE ENTRANCE WHICH WAS LOW AND CLOSED BY AN
ENORMOUS IRON DOOR
NEVERTHELESS LIGHT WAS NOT LACKING A FURNACE HAD
BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN THE THICKNESS OF THE WALL A LARGE FIRE WAS LIGHTED
THERE WHICH FILLED THE VAULT WITH ITS CRIMSON REFLECTIONS AND DEPRIVED
A MISERABLE CANDLE WHICH STOOD IN ONE CORNER OF ALL RADIANCE
THE IRON
GRATING WHICH SERVED TO CLOSE THE OVEN BEING RAISED AT THAT MOMENT
ALLOWED ONLY A VIEW AT THE MOUTH OF THE FLAMING VENT HOLE IN THE DARK
WALL THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF ITS BARS LIKE A ROW OF BLACK AND POINTED
TEETH SET FLAT APART WHICH MADE THE FURNACE RESEMBLE ONE OF THOSE
MOUTHS OF DRAGONS WHICH SPOUT FORTH FLAMES IN ANCIENT LEGENDS
BY THE
LIGHT WHICH ESCAPED FROM IT THE PRISONER BEHELD ALL ABOUT THE ROOM
FRIGHTFUL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE USE SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
IN THE CENTRE
LAY A LEATHER MATTRESS PLACED ALMOST FLAT UPON THE GROUND OVER WHICH
HUNG A STRAP PROVIDED WITH A BUCKLE ATTACHED TO A BRASS RING IN THE
MOUTH OF A FLAT NOSED MONSTER CARVED IN THE KEYSTONE OF THE VAULT
TONGS PINCERS LARGE PLOUGHSHARES FILLED THE INTERIOR OF THE FURNACE
AND GLOWED IN A CONFUSED HEAP ON THE COALS
THE SANGUINE LIGHT OF THE
FURNACE ILLUMINATED IN THE CHAMBER ONLY A CONFUSED MASS OF HORRIBLE
THINGS
THIS TARTARUS WAS CALLED SIMPLY THE QUESTION CHAMBER
ON THE BED IN A NEGLIGENT ATTITUDE SAT PIERRAT TORTERUE THE OFFICIAL
TORTURER
HIS UNDERLINGS TWO GNOMES WITH SQUARE FACES LEATHER APRONS
AND LINEN BREECHES WERE MOVING THE IRON INSTRUMENTS ON THE COALS
IN VAIN DID THE POOR GIRL SUMMON UP HER COURAGE ON ENTERING THIS
CHAMBER SHE WAS STRICKEN WITH HORROR
THE SERGEANTS OF THE BAILIFF OF THE COURTS DREW UP IN LINE ON ONE SIDE
THE PRIESTS OF THE OFFICIALITY ON THE OTHER
A CLERK INKHORN AND A
TABLE WERE IN ONE CORNER
MASTER JACQUES CHARMOLUE APPROACHED THE GYPSY WITH A VERY SWEET SMILE
MY DEAR CHILD SAID HE DO YOU STILL PERSIST IN YOUR DENIAL
YES SHE REPLIED IN A DYING VOICE
IN THAT CASE REPLIED CHARMOLUE IT WILL BE VERY PAINFUL FOR US TO
HAVE TO QUESTION YOU MORE URGENTLY THAN WE SHOULD LIKE
PRAY TAKE THE
TROUBLE TO SEAT YOURSELF ON THIS BED
MASTER PIERRAT MAKE ROOM FOR
MADEMOISELLE AND CLOSE THE DOOR
PIERRAT ROSE WITH A GROWL
IF I SHUT THE DOOR HE MUTTERED MY FIRE WILL GO OUT
WELL MY DEAR FELLOW REPLIED CHARMOLUE LEAVE IT OPEN THEN
MEANWHILE LA ESMERALDA HAD REMAINED STANDING
THAT LEATHER BED ON WHICH
SO MANY UNHAPPY WRETCHES HAD WRITHED FRIGHTENED HER
TERROR CHILLED THE
VERY MARROW OF HER BONES SHE STOOD THERE BEWILDERED AND STUPEFIED
AT
A SIGN FROM CHARMOLUE THE TWO ASSISTANTS TOOK HER AND PLACED HER IN
A SITTING POSTURE ON THE BED
THEY DID HER NO HARM BUT WHEN THESE
MEN TOUCHED HER WHEN THAT LEATHER TOUCHED HER SHE FELT ALL HER BLOOD
RETREAT TO HER HEART
SHE CAST A FRIGHTENED LOOK AROUND THE CHAMBER
IT
SEEMED TO HER AS THOUGH SHE BEHELD ADVANCING FROM ALL QUARTERS TOWARDS
HER WITH THE INTENTION OF CRAWLING UP HER BODY AND BITING AND PINCHING
HER ALL THOSE HIDEOUS IMPLEMENTS OF TORTURE WHICH AS COMPARED TO THE
INSTRUMENTS OF ALL SORTS SHE HAD HITHERTO SEEN WERE LIKE WHAT BATS
CENTIPEDES AND SPIDERS ARE AMONG INSECTS AND BIRDS
WHERE IS THE PHYSICIAN ASKED CHARMOLUE
HERE REPLIED A BLACK GOWN WHOM SHE HAD NOT BEFORE NOTICED
SHE SHUDDERED
MADEMOISELLE RESUMED THE CARESSING VOICE OF THE PROCUCRATOR OF THE
ECCLESIASTICAL COURT FOR THE THIRD TIME DO YOU PERSIST IN DENYING THE
DEEDS OF WHICH YOU ARE ACCUSED
THIS TIME SHE COULD ONLY MAKE A SIGN WITH HER HEAD
YOU PERSIST SAID JACQUES CHARMOLUE
THEN IT GRIEVES ME DEEPLY BUT I
MUST FULFIL MY OFFICE
MONSIEUR LE PROCUREUR DU ROI SAID PIERRAT ABRUPTLY HOW SHALL WE
BEGIN
CHARMOLUE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT WITH THE AMBIGUOUS GRIMACE OF A POET IN
SEARCH OF A RHYME
WITH THE BOOT HE SAID AT LAST
THE UNFORTUNATE GIRL FELT HERSELF SO UTTERLY ABANDONED BY GOD AND MEN
THAT HER HEAD FELL UPON HER BREAST LIKE AN INERT THING WHICH HAS NO
POWER IN ITSELF
THE TORMENTOR AND THE PHYSICIAN APPROACHED HER SIMULTANEOUSLY
AT
THE SAME TIME THE TWO ASSISTANTS BEGAN TO FUMBLE AMONG THEIR HIDEOUS
ARSENAL
AT THE CLANKING OF THEIR FRIGHTFUL IRONS THE UNHAPPY CHILD QUIVERED
LIKE A DEAD FROG WHICH IS BEING GALVANIZED
OH SHE MURMURED SO LOW
THAT NO ONE HEARD HER OH MY PHOEBUS THEN SHE FELL BACK ONCE MORE
INTO HER IMMOBILITY AND HER MARBLE SILENCE
THIS SPECTACLE WOULD HAVE
RENT ANY OTHER HEART THAN THOSE OF HER JUDGES
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED
HER A POOR SINFUL SOUL BEING TORTURED BY SATAN BENEATH THE SCARLET
WICKET OF HELL
THE MISERABLE BODY WHICH THAT FRIGHTFUL SWARM OF SAWS
WHEELS AND RACKS WERE ABOUT TO CLASP IN THEIR CLUTCHES THE BEING
WHO WAS ABOUT TO BE MANIPULATED BY THE HARSH HANDS OF EXECUTIONERS
AND PINCERS WAS THAT GENTLE WHITE FRAGILE CREATURE A POOR GRAIN OF
MILLET WHICH HUMAN JUSTICE WAS HANDING OVER TO THE TERRIBLE MILLS OF
TORTURE TO GRIND
MEANWHILE THE CALLOUS HANDS OF PIERRAT TORTERUE'S
ASSISTANTS HAD BARED THAT CHARMING LEG THAT TINY FOOT WHICH HAD SO
OFTEN AMAZED THE PASSERS BY WITH THEIR DELICACY AND BEAUTY IN THE
SQUARES OF PARIS
'TIS A SHAME MUTTERED THE TORMENTOR GLANCING AT THESE GRACEFUL AND
DELICATE FORMS
HAD THE ARCHDEACON BEEN PRESENT HE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE RECALLED AT
THAT MOMENT HIS SYMBOL OF THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
SOON THE UNFORTUNATE
GIRL THROUGH A MIST WHICH SPREAD BEFORE HER EYES BEHELD THE BOOT
APPROACH SHE SOON BEHELD HER FOOT ENCASED BETWEEN IRON PLATES DISAPPEAR
IN THE FRIGHTFUL APPARATUS
THEN TERROR RESTORED HER STRENGTH
TAKE THAT OFF SHE CRIED ANGRILY AND DRAWING HERSELF UP WITH HER
HAIR ALL DISHEVELLED MERCY
SHE DARTED FROM THE BED TO FLING HERSELF AT THE FEET OF THE KING'S
PROCURATOR BUT HER LEG WAS FAST IN THE HEAVY BLOCK OF OAK AND IRON AND
SHE SANK DOWN UPON THE BOOT MORE CRUSHED THAN A BEE WITH A LUMP OF LEAD
ON ITS WING
AT A SIGN FROM CHARMOLUE SHE WAS REPLACED ON THE BED AND TWO COARSE
HANDS ADJUSTED TO HER DELICATE WAIST THE STRAP WHICH HUNG FROM THE
CEILING
FOR THE LAST TIME DO YOU CONFESS THE FACTS IN THE CASE DEMANDED
CHARMOLUE WITH HIS IMPERTURBABLE BENIGNITY
I AM INNOCENT
THEN MADEMOISELLE HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCE LAID TO YOUR
CHARGE
ALAS MONSEIGNEUR I DO NOT KNOW
SO YOU DENY THEM
ALL
PROCEED SAID CHARMOLUE TO PIERRAT
PIERRAT TURNED THE HANDLE OF THE SCREW JACK THE BOOT WAS CONTRACTED
AND THE UNHAPPY GIRL UTTERED ONE OF THOSE HORRIBLE CRIES WHICH HAVE NO
ORTHOGRAPHY IN ANY HUMAN LANGUAGE
STOP SAID CHARMOLUE TO PIERRAT
DO YOU CONFESS HE SAID TO THE
GYPSY
ALL CRIED THE WRETCHED GIRL
I CONFESS I CONFESS MERCY
SHE HAD NOT CALCULATED HER STRENGTH WHEN SHE FACED THE TORTURE
POOR
CHILD WHOSE LIFE UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN SO JOYOUS SO PLEASANT SO
SWEET THE FIRST PAIN HAD CONQUERED HER
HUMANITY FORCES ME TO TELL YOU REMARKED THE KING'S PROCURATOR THAT
IN CONFESSING IT IS DEATH THAT YOU MUST EXPECT
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO SAID SHE
AND SHE FELL BACK UPON THE LEATHER BED
DYING DOUBLED UP ALLOWING HERSELF TO HANG SUSPENDED FROM THE STRAP
BUCKLED ROUND HER WAIST
COME FAIR ONE HOLD UP A LITTLE SAID MASTER PIERRAT RAISING HER
YOU HAVE THE AIR OF THE LAMB OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHICH HANGS FROM
MONSIEUR DE BOURGOGNE'S NECK
JACQUES CHARMOLUE RAISED HIS VOICE
CLERK WRITE
YOUNG BOHEMIAN MAID YOU CONFESS YOUR PARTICIPATION IN
THE FEASTS WITCHES' SABBATHS AND WITCHCRAFTS OF HELL WITH GHOSTS
HAGS AND VAMPIRES ANSWER
YES SHE SAID SO LOW THAT HER WORDS WERE LOST IN HER BREATHING
YOU CONFESS TO HAVING SEEN THE RAM WHICH BEELZEBUB CAUSES TO APPEAR IN
THE CLOUDS TO CALL TOGETHER THE WITCHES' SABBATH AND WHICH IS BEHELD BY
SOCERERS ALONE
YES
YOU CONFESS TO HAVING ADORED THE HEADS OF BOPHOMET THOSE ABOMINABLE
IDOLS OF THE TEMPLARS
YES
TO HAVING HAD HABITUAL DEALINGS WITH THE DEVIL UNDER THE FORM OF A GOAT
FAMILIAR JOINED WITH YOU IN THE SUIT

LASTLY YOU AVOW AND CONFESS TO HAVING WITH THE AID OF THE DEMON AND
OF THE PHANTOM VULGARLY KNOWN AS THE SURLY MONK ON THE NIGHT OF THE
TWENTY NINTH OF MARCH LAST MURDERED AND ASSASSINATED A CAPTAIN NAMED
PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS
SHE RAISED HER LARGE STARING EYES TO THE MAGISTRATE AND REPLIED AS
THOUGH MECHANICALLY WITHOUT CONVULSION OR AGITATION
YES
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT EVERYTHING WITHIN HER WAS BROKEN
WRITE CLERK SAID CHARMOLUE
AND ADDRESSING THE TORTURERS RELEASE
THE PRISONER AND TAKE HER BACK TO THE COURT
WHEN THE PRISONER HAD BEEN UNBOOTED THE PROCURATOR OF THE
ECCLESIASTICAL COURT EXAMINED HER FOOT WHICH WAS STILL SWOLLEN WITH
PAIN
COME SAID HE THERE'S NO GREAT HARM DONE
YOU SHRIEKED IN GOOD
SEASON
YOU COULD STILL DANCE MY BEAUTY
THEN HE TURNED TO HIS ACOLYTES OF THE OFFICIALITY BEHOLD JUSTICE
ENLIGHTENED AT LAST THIS IS A SOLACE GENTLEMEN MADAMOISELLE WILL BEAR
US WITNESS THAT WE HAVE ACTED WITH ALL POSSIBLE GENTLENESS
CHAPTER III
END OF THE CROWN WHICH WAS TURNED INTO A DRY LEAF
WHEN SHE RE ENTERED THE AUDIENCE HALL PALE AND LIMPING SHE WAS
RECEIVED WITH A GENERAL MURMUR OF PLEASURE
ON THE PART OF THE AUDIENCE
THERE WAS THE FEELING OF IMPATIENCE GRATIFIED WHICH ONE EXPERIENCES AT
THE THEATRE AT THE END OF THE LAST ENTR'ACTE OF THE COMEDY WHEN THE
CURTAIN RISES AND THE CONCLUSION IS ABOUT TO BEGIN
ON THE PART OF THE
JUDGES IT WAS THE HOPE OF GETTING THEIR SUPPERS SOONER
THE LITTLE GOAT ALSO BLEATED WITH JOY
HE TRIED TO RUN TOWARDS HIS
MISTRESS BUT THEY HAD TIED HIM TO THE BENCH
NIGHT WAS FULLY SET IN
THE CANDLES WHOSE NUMBER HAD NOT BEEN
INCREASED CAST SO LITTLE LIGHT THAT THE WALLS OF THE HALL COULD NOT BE
SEEN
THE SHADOWS THERE ENVELOPED ALL OBJECTS IN A SORT OF MIST
A FEW
APATHETIC FACES OF JUDGES ALONE COULD BE DIMLY DISCERNED
OPPOSITE THEM
AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE LONG HAIL THEY COULD SEE A VAGUELY WHITE POINT
STANDING OUT AGAINST THE SOMBRE BACKGROUND
THIS WAS THE ACCUSED
SHE HAD DRAGGED HERSELF TO HER PLACE
WHEN CHARMOLUE HAD INSTALLED
HIMSELF IN A MAGISTERIAL MANNER IN HIS OWN HE SEATED HIMSELF THEN
ROSE AND SAID WITHOUT EXHIBITING TOO MUCH SELF COMPLACENCY AT HIS
SUCCESS THE ACCUSED HAS CONFESSED ALL
BOHEMIAN GIRL THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED HAVE YOU AVOWED ALL
YOUR DEEDS OF MAGIC PROSTITUTION AND ASSASSINATION ON PHOEBUS DE
CHTEAUPERS
HER HEART CONTRACTED
SHE WAS HEARD TO SOB AMID THE DARKNESS
ANYTHING YOU LIKE SHE REPLIED FEEBLY BUT KILL ME QUICKLY
MONSIEUR PROCURATOR OF THE KING IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL COURTS SAID
THE PRESIDENT THE CHAMBER IS READY TO HEAR YOU IN YOUR CHARGE
MASTER CHARMOLUE EXHIBITED AN ALARMING NOTE BOOK AND BEGAN TO READ
WITH MANY GESTURES AND THE EXAGGERATED ACCENTUATION OF THE PLEADER AN
ORATION IN LATIN WHEREIN ALL THE PROOFS OF THE SUIT WERE PILED UP
IN CICERONIAN PERIPHRASES FLANKED WITH QUOTATIONS FROM PLAUTUS HIS
FAVORITE COMIC AUTHOR
WE REGRET THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OFFER TO OUR
READERS THIS REMARKABLE PIECE
THE ORATOR PRONOUNCED IT WITH MARVELLOUS
ACTION
BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED THE EXORDIUM THE PERSPIRATION WAS
STARTING FROM HIS BROW AND HIS EYES FROM HIS BEAD
ALL AT ONCE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FINE PERIOD HE INTERRUPTED HIMSELF AND
HIS GLANCE ORDINARILY SO GENTLE AND EVEN STUPID BECAME MENACING
GENTLEMEN HE EXCLAIMED THIS TIME IN FRENCH FOR IT WAS NOT IN
HIS COPY BOOK SATAN IS SO MIXED UP IN THIS AFFAIR THAT HERE HE IS
PRESENT AT OUR DEBATES AND MAKING SPORT OF THEIR MAJESTY
BEHOLD
SO SAYING HE POINTED TO THE LITTLE GOAT WHO ON SEEING CHARMOLUE
GESTICULATING HAD IN POINT OF FACT THOUGHT IT APPROPRIATE TO DO THE
SAME AND HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON HIS HAUNCHES REPRODUCING TO THE BEST
OF HIS ABILITY WITH HIS FOREPAWS AND HIS BEARDED HEAD THE PATHETIC
PANTOMINE OF THE KING'S PROCURATOR IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL COURT
THIS
WAS IF THE READER REMEMBERS ONE OF HIS PRETTIEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS
THIS
INCIDENT THIS LAST PROOF PRODUCED A GREAT EFFECT
THE GOAT'S
HOOFS WERE TIED AND THE KING'S PROCURATOR RESUMED THE THREAD OF HIS
ELOQUENCE
IT WAS VERY LONG BUT THE PERORATION WAS ADMIRABLE
HERE IS THE
CONCLUDING PHRASE LET THE READER ADD THE HOARSE VOICE AND THE
BREATHLESS GESTURES OF MASTER CHARMOLUE
IDEO DOMNI CORAM STRYGA DEMONSTRATA CRIMINE PATENTE INTENTIONE

THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS EXORDIUM IS CONTAINED IN THE PRESIDENT'S
SENTENCE
HE PUT ON HIS CAP AGAIN AND SEATED HIMSELF
EHEU SIGHED THE BROKEN HEARTED GRINGOIRE BASSA LATINITAS BASTARD
LATIN
ANOTHER MAN IN A BLACK GOWN ROSE NEAR THE ACCUSED HE WAS HER
LAWYER THE JUDGES WHO WERE FASTING BEGAN TO GRUMBLE
ADVOCATE BE BRIEF SAID THE PRESIDENT
MONSIEUR THE PRESIDENT REPLIED THE ADVOCATE SINCE THE DEFENDANT
HAS CONFESSED THE CRIME I HAVE ONLY ONE WORD TO SAY TO THESE GENTLEMEN
HERE IS A TEXT FROM THE SALIC LAW 'IF A WITCH HATH EATEN A MAN AND IF
SHE BE CONVICTED OF IT SHE SHALL PAY A FINE OF EIGHT THOUSAND DENIERS
WHICH AMOUNT TO TWO HUNDRED SOUS OF GOLD MAY IT PLEASE THE CHAMBER TO
CONDEMN MY CLIENT TO THE FINE
AN ABROGATED TEXT SAID THE ADVOCATE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE KING
NEGO I DENY IT REPLIED THE ADVOCATE
PUT IT TO THE VOTE SAID ONE OF THE COUNCILLORS THE CRIME IS
MANIFEST AND IT IS LATE
THEY PROCEEDED TO TAKE A VOTE WITHOUT LEAVING THE ROOM
THE JUDGES
SIGNIFIED THEIR ASSENT WITHOUT GIVING THEIR REASONS THEY WERE IN A
HURRY
THEIR CAPPED HEADS WERE SEEN UNCOVERING ONE AFTER THE OTHER IN
THE GLOOM AT THE LUGUBRIOUS QUESTION ADDRESSED TO THEM BY THE PRESIDENT
IN A LOW VOICE
THE POOR ACCUSED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF LOOKING AT THEM
BUT HER TROUBLED EYE NO LONGER SAW
THEN THE CLERK BEGAN TO WRITE THEN HE HANDED A LONG PARCH MENT TO THE
PRESIDENT
THEN THE UNHAPPY GIRL HEARD THE PEOPLE MOVING THE PIKES CLASHING AND A
FREEZING VOICE SAYING TO HER BOHEMIAN WENCH ON THE DAY WHEN IT SHALL
SEEM GOOD TO OUR LORD THE KING AT THE HOUR OF NOON YOU WILL BE TAKEN
IN A TUMBREL IN YOUR SHIFT WITH BARE FEET AND A ROPE ABOUT YOUR
NECK BEFORE THE GRAND PORTAL OF NOTRE DAME AND YOU WILL THERE MAKE AN
APOLOGY WITH A WAX TORCH OF THE WEIGHT OF TWO POUNDS IN YOUR HAND AND
THENCE YOU WILL BE CONDUCTED TO THE PLACE DE GRVE WHERE YOU WILL BE
HANGED AND STRANGLED ON THE TOWN GIBBET AND LIKEWISE YOUR GOAT AND
YOU WILL PAY TO THE OFFICIAL THREE LIONS OF GOLD IN REPARATION OF THE
CRIMES BY YOU COMMITTED AND BY YOU CONFESSED OF SORCERY AND MAGIC
DEBAUCHERY AND MURDER UPON THE PERSON OF THE SIEUR PHOEBUS DE
CHTEAUPERS
MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL
OH 'TIS A DREAM SHE MURMURED AND SHE FELT ROUGH HANDS BEARING HER
AWAY
CHAPTER IV
LASCIATE OGNI SPERANZA LEAVE ALL HOPE BEHIND YE WHO
ENTER HERE
IN THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN AN EDIFICE WAS COMPLETE THERE WAS ALMOST
AS MUCH OF IT IN THE EARTH AS ABOVE IT
UNLESS BUILT UPON PILES LIKE
NOTRE DAME A PALACE A FORTRESS A CHURCH HAD ALWAYS A DOUBLE BOTTOM
IN CATHEDRALS IT WAS IN SOME SORT ANOTHER SUBTERRANEAN CATHEDRAL
LOW DARK MYSTERIOUS BLIND AND MUTE UNDER THE UPPER NAVE WHICH WAS
OVERFLOWING WITH LIGHT AND REVERBERATING WITH ORGANS AND BELLS DAY AND
NIGHT
SOMETIMES IT WAS A SEPULCHRE
IN PALACES IN FORTRESSES IT WAS
A PRISON SOMETIMES A SEPULCHRE ALSO SOMETIMES BOTH TOGETHER
THESE
MIGHTY BUILDINGS WHOSE MODE OF FORMATION AND VEGETATION WE HAVE
ELSEWHERE EXPLAINED HAD NOT SIMPLY FOUNDATIONS BUT SO TO SPEAK
ROOTS WHICH RAN BRANCHING THROUGH THE SOIL IN CHAMBERS GALLERIES
AND STAIRCASES LIKE THE CONSTRUCTION ABOVE
THUS CHURCHES PALACES
FORTRESSES HAD THE EARTH HALF WAY UP THEIR BODIES
THE CELLARS OF AN
EDIFICE FORMED ANOTHER EDIFICE INTO WHICH ONE DESCENDED INSTEAD
OF ASCENDING AND WHICH EXTENDED ITS SUBTERRANEAN GROUNDS UNDER THE
EXTERNAL PILES OF THE MONUMENT LIKE THOSE FORESTS AND MOUNTAINS WHICH
ARE REVERSED IN THE MIRROR LIKE WATERS OF A LAKE BENEATH THE FORESTS
AND MOUNTAINS OF THE BANKS
AT THE FORTRESS OF SAINT ANTOINE AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE OF PARIS
AT THE LOUVRE THESE SUBTERRANEAN EDIFICES WERE PRISONS
THE STORIES OF
THESE PRISONS AS THEY SANK INTO THE SOIL GREW CONSTANTLY NARROWER AND
MORE GLOOMY
THEY WERE SO MANY ZONES WHERE THE SHADES OF HORROR WERE
GRADUATED
DANTE COULD NEVER IMAGINE ANYTHING BETTER FOR HIS HELL
THESE
TUNNELS OF CELLS USUALLY TERMINATED IN A SACK OF A LOWEST DUNGEON WITH
A VAT LIKE BOTTOM WHERE DANTE PLACED SATAN WHERE SOCIETY PLACED THOSE
CONDEMNED TO DEATH
A MISERABLE HUMAN EXISTENCE ONCE INTERRED THERE
FAREWELL LIGHT AIR LIFE OGNI SPERANZA EVERY HOPE IT ONLY CAME
FORTH TO THE SCAFFOLD OR THE STAKE
SOMETIMES IT ROTTED THERE HUMAN
JUSTICE CALLED THIS FORGETTING BETWEEN MEN AND HIMSELF THE CONDEMNED
MAN FELT A PILE OF STONES AND JAILERS WEIGHING DOWN UPON HIS HEAD
AND THE ENTIRE PRISON THE MASSIVE BASTILLE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN AN
ENORMOUS COMPLICATED LOCK WHICH BARRED HIM OFF FROM THE REST OF THE
WORLD
IT WAS IN A SLOPING CAVITY OF THIS DESCRIPTION IN THE OUBLIETTES
EXCAVATED BY SAINT LOUIS IN THE INPACE OF THE TOURNELLE THAT LA
ESMERALDA HAD BEEN PLACED ON BEING CONDEMNED TO DEATH THROUGH FEAR OF
HER ESCAPE NO DOUBT WITH THE COLOSSAL COURT HOUSE OVER HER HEAD
POOR
FLY WHO COULD NOT HAVE LIFTED EVEN ONE OF ITS BLOCKS OF STONE
ASSUREDLY PROVIDENCE AND SOCIETY HAD BEEN EQUALLY UNJUST SUCH AN
EXCESS OF UNHAPPINESS AND OF TORTURE WAS NOT NECESSARY TO BREAK SO FRAIL
A CREATURE
THERE SHE LAY LOST IN THE SHADOWS BURIED HIDDEN IMMURED
ANY ONE
WHO COULD HAVE BEHELD HER IN THIS STATE AFTER HAVING SEEN HER LAUGH AND
DANCE IN THE SUN WOULD HAVE SHUDDERED
COLD AS NIGHT COLD AS DEATH
NOT A BREATH OF AIR IN HER TRESSES NOT A HUMAN SOUND IN HER EAR
NO LONGER A RAY OF LIGHT IN HER EYES SNAPPED IN TWAIN CRUSHED WITH
CHAINS CROUCHING BESIDE A JUG AND A LOAF ON A LITTLE STRAW IN A
POOL OF WATER WHICH WAS FORMED UNDER HER BY THE SWEATING OF THE PRISON
WALLS WITHOUT MOTION ALMOST WITHOUT BREATH SHE HAD NO LONGER THE
POWER TO SUFFER PHOEBUS THE SUN MIDDAY THE OPEN AIR THE STREETS OF
PARIS THE DANCES WITH APPLAUSE THE SWEET BABBLINGS OF LOVE WITH THE
OFFICER THEN THE PRIEST THE OLD CRONE THE POIGNARD THE BLOOD
THE TORTURE THE GIBBET ALL THIS DID INDEED PASS BEFORE HER MIND
SOMETIMES AS A CHARMING AND GOLDEN VISION SOMETIMES AS A HIDEOUS
NIGHTMARE BUT IT WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT A VAGUE AND HORRIBLE
STRUGGLE LOST IN THE GLOOM OR DISTANT MUSIC PLAYED UP ABOVE GROUND
AND WHICH WAS NO LONGER AUDIBLE AT THE DEPTH WHERE THE UNHAPPY GIRL HAD
FALLEN
SINCE SHE HAD BEEN THERE SHE HAD NEITHER WAKED NOR SLEPT
IN THAT
MISFORTUNE IN THAT CELL SHE COULD NO LONGER DISTINGUISH HER WAKING
HOURS FROM SLUMBER DREAMS FROM REALITY ANY MORE THAN DAY FROM NIGHT
ALL THIS WAS MIXED BROKEN FLOATING DISSEMINATED CONFUSEDLY IN HER
THOUGHT
SHE NO LONGER FELT SHE NO LONGER KNEW SHE NO LONGER THOUGHT
AT THE MOST SHE ONLY DREAMED
NEVER HAD A LIVING CREATURE BEEN THRUST
MORE DEEPLY INTO NOTHINGNESS
THUS BENUMBED FROZEN PETRIFIED SHE HAD BARELY NOTICED ON TWO OR THREE
OCCASIONS THE SOUND OF A TRAP DOOR OPENING SOMEWHERE ABOVE HER WITHOUT
EVEN PERMITTING THE PASSAGE OF A LITTLE LIGHT AND THROUGH WHICH A HAND
HAD TOSSED HER A BIT OF BLACK BREAD
NEVERTHELESS THIS PERIODICAL
VISIT OF THE JAILER WAS THE SOLE COMMUNICATION WHICH WAS LEFT HER WITH
MANKIND
A SINGLE THING STILL MECHANICALLY OCCUPIED HER EAR ABOVE HER HEAD THE
DAMPNESS WAS FILTERING THROUGH THE MOULDY STONES OF THE VAULT AND
A DROP OF WATER DROPPED FROM THEM AT REGULAR INTERVALS
SHE LISTENED
STUPIDLY TO THE NOISE MADE BY THIS DROP OF WATER AS IT FELL INTO THE
POOL BESIDE HER
THIS DROP OF WATER FALLING FROM TIME TO TIME INTO THAT POOL WAS THE
ONLY MOVEMENT WHICH STILL WENT ON AROUND HER THE ONLY CLOCK WHICH
MARKED THE TIME THE ONLY NOISE WHICH REACHED HER OF ALL THE NOISE MADE
ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
TO TELL THE WHOLE HOWEVER SHE ALSO FELT FROM TIME TO TIME IN THAT
CESSPOOL OF MIRE AND DARKNESS SOMETHING COLD PASSING OVER HER FOOT OR
HER ARM AND SHE SHUDDERED
HOW LONG HAD SHE BEEN THERE SHE DID NOT KNOW
SHE HAD A RECOLLECTION
OF A SENTENCE OF DEATH PRONOUNCED SOMEWHERE AGAINST SOME ONE THEN
OF HAVING BEEN HERSELF CARRIED AWAY AND OF WAKING UP IN DARKNESS AND
SILENCE CHILLED TO THE HEART
SHE HAD DRAGGED HERSELF ALONG ON HER
HANDS
THEN IRON RINGS THAT CUT HER ANKLES AND CHAINS HAD RATTLED
SHE
HAD RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT ALL AROUND HER WAS WALL THAT BELOW HER
THERE WAS A PAVEMENT COVERED WITH MOISTURE AND A TRUSS OF STRAW BUT
NEITHER LAMP NOR AIR HOLE
THEN SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THAT STRAW
AND SOMETIMES FOR THE SAKE OF CHANGING HER ATTITUDE ON THE LAST
STONE STEP IN HER DUNGEON
FOR A WHILE SHE HAD TRIED TO COUNT THE BLACK
MINUTES MEASURED OFF FOR HER BY THE DROP OF WATER BUT THAT MELANCHOLY
LABOR OF AN AILING BRAIN HAD BROKEN OFF OF ITSELF IN HER HEAD AND HAD
LEFT HER IN STUPOR
AT LENGTH ONE DAY OR ONE NIGHT FOR MIDNIGHT AND MIDDAY WERE OF THE
SAME COLOR IN THAT SEPULCHRE SHE HEARD ABOVE HER A LOUDER NOISE THAN
WAS USUALLY MADE BY THE TURNKEY WHEN HE BROUGHT HER BREAD AND JUG OF
WATER
SHE RAISED HER HEAD AND BEHELD A RAY OF REDDISH LIGHT PASSING
THROUGH THE CREVICES IN THE SORT OF TRAPDOOR CONTRIVED IN THE ROOF OF
THE INPACE
AT THE SAME TIME THE HEAVY LOCK CREAKED THE TRAP GRATED ON ITS RUSTY
HINGES TURNED AND SHE BEHELD A LANTERN A HAND AND THE LOWER PORTIONS
OF THE BODIES OF TWO MEN THE DOOR BEING TOO LOW TO ADMIT OF HER SEEING
THEIR HEADS
THE LIGHT PAINED HER SO ACUTELY THAT SHE SHUT HER EYES
WHEN SHE OPENED THEM AGAIN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED THE LANTERN WAS
DEPOSITED ON ONE OF THE STEPS OF THE STAIRCASE A MAN ALONE STOOD BEFORE
HER
A MONK'S BLACK CLOAK FELL TO HIS FEET A COWL OF THE SAME COLOR
CONCEALED HIS FACE
NOTHING WAS VISIBLE OF HIS PERSON NEITHER FACE NOR
HANDS
IT WAS A LONG BLACK SHROUD STANDING ERECT AND BENEATH WHICH
SOMETHING COULD BE FELT MOVING
SHE GAZED FIXEDLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
AT THIS SORT OF SPECTRE
BUT NEITHER HE NOR SHE SPOKE
ONE WOULD HAVE
PRONOUNCED THEM TWO STATUES CONFRONTING EACH OTHER
TWO THINGS ONLY
SEEMED ALIVE IN THAT CAVERN THE WICK OF THE LANTERN WHICH SPUTTERED
ON ACCOUNT OF THE DAMPNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE DROP OF WATER
FROM THE ROOF WHICH CUT THIS IRREGULAR SPUTTERING WITH ITS MONOTONOUS
SPLASH AND MADE THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN QUIVER IN CONCENTRIC WAVES ON
THE OILY WATER OF THE POOL
AT LAST THE PRISONER BROKE THE SILENCE
WHO ARE YOU
A PRIEST
THE WORDS THE ACCENT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE MADE HER TREMBLE
THE PRIEST CONTINUED IN A HOLLOW VOICE
ARE YOU PREPARED
FOR WHAT
TO DIE
OH SAID SHE WILL IT BE SOON
TO MORROW
HER HEAD WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED WITH JOY FELL BACK UPON HER BREAST
'TIS VERY FAR AWAY YET SHE MURMURED WHY COULD THEY NOT HAVE DONE IT
TO DAY
THEN YOU ARE VERY UNHAPPY ASKED THE PRIEST AFTER A SILENCE
I AM VERY COLD SHE REPLIED
SHE TOOK HER FEET IN HER HANDS A GESTURE HABITUAL WITH UNHAPPY WRETCHES
WHO ARE COLD AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN THE CASE OF THE RECLUSE OF THE
TOUR ROLAND AND HER TEETH CHATTERED
THE PRIEST APPEARED TO CAST HIS EYES AROUND THE DUNGEON FROM BENEATH HIS
COWL
WITHOUT LIGHT WITHOUT FIRE IN THE WATER IT IS HORRIBLE
YES SHE REPLIED WITH THE BEWILDERED AIR WHICH UNHAPPINESS HAD GIVEN
HER
THE DAY BELONGS TO EVERY ONE WHY DO THEY GIVE ME ONLY NIGHT
DO YOU KNOW RESUMED THE PRIEST AFTER A FRESH SILENCE WHY YOU ARE
HERE
I THOUGHT I KNEW ONCE SHE SAID PASSING HER THIN FINGERS OVER HER
EYELIDS AS THOUGH TO AID HER MEMORY BUT I KNOW NO LONGER
ALL AT ONCE SHE BEGAN TO WEEP LIKE A CHILD
I SHOULD LIKE TO GET AWAY FROM HERE SIR
I AM COLD I AM AFRAID AND
THERE ARE CREATURES WHICH CRAWL OVER MY BODY
WELL FOLLOW ME
SO SAYING THE PRIEST TOOK HER ARM
THE UNHAPPY GIRL WAS FROZEN TO HER
VERY SOUL
YET THAT HAND PRODUCED AN IMPRESSION OF COLD UPON HER
OH SHE MURMURED 'TIS THE ICY HAND OF DEATH
WHO ARE YOU
THE PRIEST THREW BACK HIS COWL SHE LOOKED
IT WAS THE SINISTER VISAGE
WHICH HAD SO LONG PURSUED HER THAT DEMON'S HEAD WHICH HAD APPEARED AT
LA FALOURDEL'S ABOVE THE HEAD OF HER ADORED PHOEBUS THAT EYE WHICH SHE
LAST HAD SEEN GLITTERING BESIDE A DAGGER
THIS APPARITION ALWAYS SO FATAL FOR HER AND WHICH HAD THUS DRIVEN HER
ON FROM MISFORTUNE TO MISFORTUNE EVEN TO TORTURE ROUSED HER FROM HER
STUPOR
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THE SORT OF VEIL WHICH HAD LAIN THICK UPON
HER MEMORY WAS RENT AWAY
ALL THE DETAILS OF HER MELANCHOLY ADVENTURE
FROM THE NOCTURNAL SCENE AT LA FALOURDEL'S TO HER CONDEMNATION TO THE
TOURNELLE RECURRED TO HER MEMORY NO LONGER VAGUE AND CONFUSED AS
HERETOFORE BUT DISTINCT HARSH CLEAR PALPITATING TERRIBLE
THESE
SOUVENIRS HALF EFFACED AND ALMOST OBLITERATED BY EXCESS OF SUFFERING
WERE REVIVED BY THE SOMBRE FIGURE WHICH STOOD BEFORE HER AS THE
APPROACH OF FIRE CAUSES LETTERS TRACED UPON WHITE PAPER WITH INVISIBLE
INK TO START OUT PERFECTLY FRESH
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT ALL THE WOUNDS
OF HER HEART OPENED AND BLED SIMULTANEOUSLY
HAH SHE CRIED WITH HER HANDS ON HER EYES AND A CONVULSIVE
TREMBLING 'TIS THE PRIEST
THEN SHE DROPPED HER ARMS IN DISCOURAGEMENT AND REMAINED SEATED WITH
LOWERED HEAD EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND MUTE AND STILL TREMBLING
THE PRIEST GAZED AT HER WITH THE EYE OF A HAWK WHICH HAS LONG BEEN
SOARING IN A CIRCLE FROM THE HEIGHTS OF HEAVEN OVER A POOR LARK COWERING
IN THE WHEAT AND HAS LONG BEEN SILENTLY CONTRACTING THE FORMIDABLE
CIRCLES OF HIS FLIGHT AND HAS SUDDENLY SWOOPED DOWN UPON HIS PREY LIKE
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING AND HOLDS IT PANTING IN HIS TALONS
SHE BEGAN TO MURMUR IN A LOW VOICE
FINISH FINISH THE LAST BLOW AND SHE DREW HER HEAD DOWN IN TERROR
BETWEEN HER SHOULDERS LIKE THE LAMB AWAITING THE BLOW OF THE BUTCHER'S
AXE
SO I INSPIRE YOU WITH HORROR HE SAID AT LENGTH
SHE MADE NO REPLY
DO I INSPIRE YOU WITH HORROR HE REPEATED
HER LIPS CONTRACTED AS THOUGH WITH A SMILE
YES SAID SHE THE HEADSMAN SCOFFS AT THE CONDEMNED
HERE HE HAS BEEN
PURSUING ME THREATENING ME TERRIFYING ME FOR MONTHS HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR HIM MY GOD HOW HAPPY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IT WAS HE WHO CAST ME
INTO THIS ABYSS OH HEAVENS IT WAS HE WHO KILLED HIM MY PHOEBUS
HERE BURSTING INTO SOBS AND RAISING HER EYES TO THE PRIEST
OH WRETCH WHO ARE YOU WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU DO YOU THEN HATE ME
SO ALAS WHAT HAVE YOU AGAINST ME
I LOVE THEE CRIED THE PRIEST
HER TEARS SUDDENLY CEASED SHE GAZED AT HIM WITH THE LOOK OF AN IDIOT
HE HAD FALLEN ON HIS KNEES AND WAS DEVOURING HER WITH EYES OF FLAME
DOST THOU UNDERSTAND I LOVE THEE HE CRIED AGAIN
WHAT LOVE SAID THE UNHAPPY GIRL WITH A SHUDDER
HE RESUMED
THE LOVE OF A DAMNED SOUL
BOTH REMAINED SILENT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES CRUSHED BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF
THEIR EMOTIONS HE MADDENED SHE STUPEFIED
LISTEN SAID THE PRIEST AT LAST AND A SINGULAR CALM HAD COME OVER
HIM YOU SHALL KNOW ALL I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU THAT WHICH I HAVE
HITHERTO HARDLY DARED TO SAY TO MYSELF WHEN FURTIVELY INTERROGATING MY
CONSCIENCE AT THOSE DEEP HOURS OF THE NIGHT WHEN IT IS SO DARK THAT IT
SEEMS AS THOUGH GOD NO LONGER SAW US
LISTEN
BEFORE I KNEW YOU YOUNG
GIRL I WAS HAPPY
SO WAS I SHE SIGHED FEEBLY
DO NOT INTERRUPT ME
YES I WAS HAPPY AT LEAST I BELIEVED MYSELF TO BE
SO
I WAS PURE MY SOUL WAS FILLED WITH LIMPID LIGHT
NO HEAD WAS RAISED
MORE PROUDLY AND MORE RADIANTLY THAN MINE
PRIESTS CONSULTED ME ON
CHASTITY DOCTORS ON DOCTRINES
YES SCIENCE WAS ALL IN ALL TO ME IT
WAS A SISTER TO ME AND A SISTER SUFFICED
NOT BUT THAT WITH AGE OTHER
IDEAS CAME TO ME
MORE THAN ONCE MY FLESH HAD BEEN MOVED AS A WOMAN'S
FORM PASSED BY
THAT FORCE OF SEX AND BLOOD WHICH IN THE MADNESS OF
YOUTH I HAD IMAGINED THAT I HAD STIFLED FOREVER HAD MORE THAN ONCE
CONVULSIVELY RAISED THE CHAIN OF IRON VOWS WHICH BIND ME A MISERABLE
WRETCH TO THE COLD STONES OF THE ALTAR
BUT FASTING PRAYER STUDY
THE MORTIFICATIONS OF THE CLOISTER RENDERED MY SOUL MISTRESS OF MY BODY
ONCE MORE AND THEN I AVOIDED WOMEN
MOREOVER I HAD BUT TO OPEN A BOOK
AND ALL THE IMPURE MISTS OF MY BRAIN VANISHED BEFORE THE SPLENDORS OF
SCIENCE
IN A FEW MOMENTS I FELT THE GROSS THINGS OF EARTH FLEE FAR
AWAY AND I FOUND MYSELF ONCE MORE CALM QUIETED AND SERENE IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE TRANQUIL RADIANCE OF ETERNAL TRUTH
AS LONG AS THE DEMON
SENT TO ATTACK ME ONLY VAGUE SHADOWS OF WOMEN WHO PASSED OCCASIONALLY
BEFORE MY EYES IN CHURCH IN THE STREETS IN THE FIELDS AND WHO HARDLY
RECURRED TO MY DREAMS I EASILY VANQUISHED HIM
ALAS IF THE VICTORY HAS
NOT REMAINED WITH ME IT IS THE FAULT OF GOD WHO HAS NOT CREATED MAN
AND THE DEMON OF EQUAL FORCE
LISTEN
ONE DAY
HERE THE PRIEST PAUSED AND THE PRISONER HEARD SIGHS OF ANGUISH BREAK
FROM HIS BREAST WITH A SOUND OF THE DEATH RATTLE
HE RESUMED
ONE DAY I WAS LEANING ON THE WINDOW OF MY CELL
WHAT BOOK WAS I READING
THEN OH ALL THAT IS A WHIRLWIND IN MY HEAD
I WAS READING
THE WINDOW
OPENED UPON A SQUARE
I HEARD A SOUND OF TAMBOURINE AND MUSIC
ANNOYED
AT BEING THUS DISTURBED IN MY REVERY I GLANCED INTO THE SQUARE
WHAT
I BEHELD OTHERS SAW BESIDE MYSELF AND YET IT WAS NOT A SPECTACLE MADE
FOR HUMAN EYES
THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAVEMENT IT WAS MIDDAY
THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY A CREATURE WAS DANCING
A CREATURE SO
BEAUTIFUL THAT GOD WOULD HAVE PREFERRED HER TO THE VIRGIN AND HAVE
CHOSEN HER FOR HIS MOTHER AND HAVE WISHED TO BE BORN OF HER IF SHE
HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE WHEN HE WAS MADE MAN HER EYES WERE BLACK AND
SPLENDID IN THE MIDST OF HER BLACK LOCKS SOME HAIRS THROUGH WHICH THE
SUN SHONE GLISTENED LIKE THREADS OF GOLD
HER FEET DISAPPEARED IN THEIR
MOVEMENTS LIKE THE SPOKES OF A RAPIDLY TURNING WHEEL
AROUND HER HEAD
IN HER BLACK TRESSES THERE WERE DISKS OF METAL WHICH GLITTERED IN THE
SUN AND FORMED A CORONET OF STARS ON HER BROW
HER DRESS THICK SET WITH
SPANGLES BLUE AND DOTTED WITH A THOUSAND SPARKS GLEAMED LIKE A SUMMER
NIGHT
HER BROWN SUPPLE ARMS TWINED AND UNTWINED AROUND HER WAIST LIKE
TWO SCARFS
THE FORM OF HER BODY WAS SURPRISINGLY BEAUTIFUL
OH WHAT
A RESPLENDENT FIGURE STOOD OUT LIKE SOMETHING LUMINOUS EVEN IN THE
SUNLIGHT ALAS YOUNG GIRL IT WAS THOU SURPRISED INTOXICATED
CHARMED I ALLOWED MYSELF TO GAZE UPON THEE
I LOOKED SO LONG THAT I
SUDDENLY SHUDDERED WITH TERROR I FELT THAT FATE WAS SEIZING HOLD OF
ME
THE PRIEST PAUSED FOR A MOMENT OVERCOME WITH EMOTION
THEN HE
CONTINUED
ALREADY HALF FASCINATED I TRIED TO CLING FAST TO SOMETHING AND HOLD
MYSELF BACK FROM FALLING
I RECALLED THE SNARES WHICH SATAN HAD ALREADY
SET FOR ME
THE CREATURE BEFORE MY EYES POSSESSED THAT SUPERHUMAN BEAUTY
WHICH CAN COME ONLY FROM HEAVEN OR HELL
IT WAS NO SIMPLE GIRL MADE WITH
A LITTLE OF OUR EARTH AND DIMLY LIGHTED WITHIN BY THE VACILLATING RAY
OF A WOMAN'S SOUL
IT WAS AN ANGEL BUT OF SHADOWS AND FLAME AND NOT OF
LIGHT
AT THE MOMENT WHEN I WAS MEDITATING THUS I BEHELD BESIDE YOU A
GOAT A BEAST OF WITCHES WHICH SMILED AS IT GAZED AT ME
THE MIDDAY SUN
GAVE HIM GOLDEN HORNS
THEN I PERCEIVED THE SNARE OF THE DEMON AND I NO
LONGER DOUBTED THAT YOU HAD COME FROM HELL AND THAT YOU HAD COME THENCE
FOR MY PERDITION
I BELIEVED IT
HERE THE PRIEST LOOKED THE PRISONER FULL IN THE FACE AND ADDED
COLDLY
I BELIEVE IT STILL
NEVERTHELESS THE CHARM OPERATED LITTLE BY LITTLE
YOUR DANCING WHIRLED THROUGH MY BRAIN I FELT THE MYSTERIOUS SPELL
WORKING WITHIN ME
ALL THAT SHOULD HAVE AWAKENED WAS LULLED TO SLEEP
AND LIKE THOSE WHO DIE IN THE SNOW I FELT PLEASURE IN ALLOWING THIS
SLEEP TO DRAW ON
ALL AT ONCE YOU BEGAN TO SING
WHAT COULD I DO
UNHAPPY WRETCH YOUR SONG WAS STILL MORE CHARMING THAN YOUR DANCING
I
TRIED TO FLEE
IMPOSSIBLE
I WAS NAILED ROOTED TO THE SPOT
IT SEEMED
TO ME THAT THE MARBLE OF THE PAVEMENT HAD RISEN TO MY KNEES
I WAS
FORCED TO REMAIN UNTIL THE END
MY FEET WERE LIKE ICE MY HEAD WAS ON
FIRE
AT LAST YOU TOOK PITY ON ME YOU CEASED TO SING YOU DISAPPEARED
THE REFLECTION OF THE DAZZLING VISION THE REVERBERATION OF THE
ENCHANTING MUSIC DISAPPEARED BY DEGREES FROM MY EYES AND MY EARS
THEN I
FELL BACK INTO THE EMBRASURE OF THE WINDOW MORE RIGID MORE FEEBLE THAN
A STATUE TORN FROM ITS BASE
THE VESPER BELL ROUSED ME
I DREW MYSELF
UP I FLED BUT ALAS SOMETHING WITHIN ME HAD FALLEN NEVER TO RISE
AGAIN SOMETHING HAD COME UPON ME FROM WHICH I COULD NOT FLEE
HE MADE ANOTHER PAUSE AND WENT ON
YES DATING FROM THAT DAY THERE WAS WITHIN ME A MAN WHOM I DID NOT
KNOW
I TRIED TO MAKE USE OF ALL MY REMEDIES
THE CLOISTER THE ALTAR
WORK BOOKS FOLLIES OH HOW HOLLOW DOES SCIENCE SOUND WHEN ONE IN
DESPAIR DASHES AGAINST IT A HEAD FULL OF PASSIONS DO YOU KNOW YOUNG
GIRL WHAT I SAW THENCEFORTH BETWEEN MY BOOK AND ME YOU YOUR SHADE
THE IMAGE OF THE LUMINOUS APPARITION WHICH HAD ONE DAY CROSSED THE SPACE
BEFORE ME
BUT THIS IMAGE HAD NO LONGER THE SAME COLOR IT WAS SOMBRE
FUNEREAL GLOOMY AS THE BLACK CIRCLE WHICH LONG PURSUES THE VISION OF
THE IMPRUDENT MAN WHO HAS GAZED INTENTLY AT THE SUN
UNABLE TO RID MYSELF OF IT SINCE I HEARD YOUR SONG HUMMING EVER IN
MY HEAD BEHELD YOUR FEET DANCING ALWAYS ON MY BREVIARY FELT EVEN AT
NIGHT IN MY DREAMS YOUR FORM IN CONTACT WITH MY OWN I DESIRED TO SEE
YOU AGAIN TO TOUCH YOU TO KNOW WHO YOU WERE TO SEE WHETHER I SHOULD
REALLY FIND YOU LIKE THE IDEAL IMAGE WHICH I HAD RETAINED OF YOU TO
SHATTER MY DREAM PERCHANCE WITH REALITY
AT ALL EVENTS I HOPED THAT
A NEW IMPRESSION WOULD EFFACE THE FIRST AND THE FIRST HAD BECOME
INSUPPORTABLE
I SOUGHT YOU
I SAW YOU ONCE MORE
CALAMITY WHEN I HAD
SEEN YOU TWICE I WANTED TO SEE YOU A THOUSAND TIMES I WANTED TO SEE
YOU ALWAYS
THEN HOW STOP MYSELF ON THAT SLOPE OF HELL THEN I NO
LONGER BELONGED TO MYSELF
THE OTHER END OF THE THREAD WHICH THE DEMON
HAD ATTACHED TO MY WINGS HE HAD FASTENED TO HIS FOOT
I BECAME VAGRANT
AND WANDERING LIKE YOURSELF
I WAITED FOR YOU UNDER PORCHES I STOOD ON
THE LOOKOUT FOR YOU AT THE STREET CORNERS I WATCHED FOR YOU FROM THE
SUMMIT OF MY TOWER
EVERY EVENING I RETURNED TO MYSELF MORE CHARMED
MORE DESPAIRING MORE BEWITCHED MORE LOST
I HAD LEARNED WHO YOU WERE AN EGYPTIAN BOHEMIAN GYPSY ZINGARA
HOW
COULD I DOUBT THE MAGIC LISTEN
I HOPED THAT A TRIAL WOULD FREE ME FROM
THE CHARM
A WITCH ENCHANTED BRUNO D'AST HE HAD HER BURNED AND WAS
CURED
I KNEW IT
I WANTED TO TRY THE REMEDY
FIRST I TRIED TO HAVE YOU
FORBIDDEN THE SQUARE IN FRONT OF NOTRE DAME HOPING TO FORGET YOU IF YOU
RETURNED NO MORE
YOU PAID NO HEED TO IT
YOU RETURNED
THEN THE IDEA OF
ABDUCTING YOU OCCURRED TO ME
ONE NIGHT I MADE THE ATTEMPT
THERE WERE
TWO OF US
WE ALREADY HAD YOU IN OUR POWER WHEN THAT MISERABLE OFFICER
CAME UP
HE DELIVERED YOU
THUS DID HE BEGIN YOUR UNHAPPINESS MINE AND
HIS OWN
FINALLY NO LONGER KNOWING WHAT TO DO AND WHAT WAS TO BECOME
OF ME I DENOUNCED YOU TO THE OFFICIAL
I THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD BE CURED LIKE BRUNO D'AST
I ALSO HAD A
CONFUSED IDEA THAT A TRIAL WOULD DELIVER YOU INTO MY HANDS THAT AS A
PRISONER I SHOULD HOLD YOU I SHOULD HAVE YOU THAT THERE YOU COULD NOT
ESCAPE FROM ME THAT YOU HAD ALREADY POSSESSED ME A SUFFICIENTLY LONG
TIME TO GIVE ME THE RIGHT TO POSSESS YOU IN MY TURN
WHEN ONE DOES
WRONG ONE MUST DO IT THOROUGHLY
'TIS MADNESS TO HALT MIDWAY IN THE
MONSTROUS THE EXTREME OF CRIME HAS ITS DELIRIUMS OF JOY
A PRIEST AND A
WITCH CAN MINGLE IN DELIGHT UPON THE TRUSS OF STRAW IN A DUNGEON
ACCORDINGLY I DENOUNCED YOU
IT WAS THEN THAT I TERRIFIED YOU WHEN
WE MET
THE PLOT WHICH I WAS WEAVING AGAINST YOU THE STORM WHICH I
WAS HEAPING UP ABOVE YOUR HEAD BURST FROM ME IN THREATS AND LIGHTNING
GLANCES
STILL I HESITATED
MY PROJECT HAD ITS TERRIBLE SIDES WHICH
MADE ME SHRINK BACK
PERHAPS I MIGHT HAVE RENOUNCED IT PERHAPS MY HIDEOUS THOUGHT WOULD
HAVE WITHERED IN MY BRAIN WITHOUT BEARING FRUIT
I THOUGHT THAT
IT WOULD ALWAYS DEPEND UPON ME TO FOLLOW UP OR DISCONTINUE THIS
PROSECUTION
BUT EVERY EVIL THOUGHT IS INEXORABLE AND INSISTS ON
BECOMING A DEED BUT WHERE I BELIEVED MYSELF TO BE ALL POWERFUL FATE
WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN I
ALAS 'TIS FATE WHICH HAS SEIZED YOU AND
DELIVERED YOU TO THE TERRIBLE WHEELS OF THE MACHINE WHICH I HAD
CONSTRUCTED DOUBLY
LISTEN
I AM NEARING THE END
ONE DAY AGAIN THE SUN WAS SHINING BRILLIANTLY I BEHOLD MAN PASS ME
UTTERING YOUR NAME AND LAUGHING WHO CARRIES SENSUALITY IN HIS EYES
DAMNATION I FOLLOWED HIM YOU KNOW THE REST
HE CEASED
THE YOUNG GIRL COULD FIND BUT ONE WORD
OH MY PHOEBUS
NOT THAT NAME SAID THE PRIEST GRASPING HER ARM VIOLENTLY
UTTER NOT
THAT NAME OH MISERABLE WRETCHES THAT WE ARE 'TIS THAT NAME WHICH HAS
RUINED US OR RATHER WE HAVE RUINED EACH OTHER BY THE INEXPLICABLE PLAY
OF FATE YOU ARE SUFFERING ARE YOU NOT YOU ARE COLD THE NIGHT MAKES
YOU BLIND THE DUNGEON ENVELOPS YOU BUT PERHAPS YOU STILL HAVE SOME
LIGHT IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SOUL WERE IT ONLY YOUR CHILDISH LOVE FOR
THAT EMPTY MAN WHO PLAYED WITH YOUR HEART WHILE I BEAR THE DUNGEON
WITHIN ME WITHIN ME THERE IS WINTER ICE DESPAIR I HAVE NIGHT IN MY
SOUL
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE SUFFERED I WAS PRESENT AT YOUR TRIAL
I WAS
SEATED ON THE OFFICIAL'S BENCH
YES UNDER ONE OF THE PRIESTS' COWLS
THERE WERE THE CONTORTIONS OF THE DAMNED
WHEN YOU WERE BROUGHT IN I
WAS THERE WHEN YOU WERE QUESTIONED I WAS THERE DEN OF WOLVES IT
WAS MY CRIME IT WAS MY GALLOWS THAT I BEHELD BEING SLOWLY REARED OVER
YOUR HEAD
I WAS THERE FOR EVERY WITNESS EVERY PROOF EVERY PLEA I
COULD COUNT EACH OF YOUR STEPS IN THE PAINFUL PATH I WAS STILL THERE
WHEN THAT FEROCIOUS BEAST OH I HAD NOT FORESEEN TORTURE LISTEN
I FOLLOWED YOU TO THAT CHAMBER OF ANGUISH
I BEHELD YOU STRIPPED AND
HANDLED HALF NAKED BY THE INFAMOUS HANDS OF THE TORMENTOR
I BEHELD
YOUR FOOT THAT FOOT WHICH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN AN EMPIRE TO KISS AND DIE
THAT FOOT BENEATH WHICH TO HAVE HAD MY HEAD CRUSHED I SHOULD HAVE FELT
SUCH RAPTURE I BEHELD IT ENCASED IN THAT HORRIBLE BOOT WHICH CONVERTS
THE LIMBS OF A LIVING BEING INTO ONE BLOODY CLOD
OH WRETCH WHILE
I LOOKED ON AT THAT I HELD BENEATH MY SHROUD A DAGGER WITH WHICH I
LACERATED MY BREAST
WHEN YOU UTTERED THAT CRY I PLUNGED IT INTO MY
FLESH AT A SECOND CRY IT WOULD HAVE ENTERED MY HEART
LOOK I BELIEVE
THAT IT STILL BLEEDS
HE OPENED HIS CASSOCK
HIS BREAST WAS IN FACT MANGLED AS BY THE CLAW OF
A TIGER AND ON HIS SIDE HE HAD A LARGE AND BADLY HEALED WOUND
THE PRISONER RECOILED WITH HORROR
OH SAID THE PRIEST YOUNG GIRL HAVE PITY UPON ME YOU THINK

IMMORTALITY AND ETERNITY THIS LIFE AND THE OTHER TO REGRET THAT ONE
IS NOT A KING EMPEROR ARCHANGEL GOD IN ORDER THAT ONE MIGHT PLACE
A GREATER SLAVE BENEATH HER FEET TO CLASP HER NIGHT AND DAY IN ONE'S
DREAMS AND ONE'S THOUGHTS AND TO BEHOLD HER IN LOVE WITH THE TRAPPINGS
OF A SOLDIER AND TO HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER HER BUT A PRIEST'S DIRTY
CASSOCK WHICH WILL INSPIRE HER WITH FEAR AND DISGUST TO BE PRESENT
WITH ONE'S JEALOUSY AND ONE'S RAGE WHILE SHE LAVISHES ON A MISERABLE
BLUSTERING IMBECILE TREASURES OF LOVE AND BEAUTY TO BEHOLD THAT BODY
WHOSE FORM BURNS YOU THAT BOSOM WHICH POSSESSES SO MUCH SWEETNESS THAT
FLESH PALPITATE AND BLUSH BENEATH THE KISSES OF ANOTHER OH HEAVEN TO
LOVE HER FOOT HER ARM HER SHOULDER TO THINK OF HER BLUE VEINS OF HER
BROWN SKIN UNTIL ONE WRITHES FOR WHOLE NIGHTS TOGETHER ON THE PAVEMENT
OF ONE'S CELL AND TO BEHOLD ALL THOSE CARESSES WHICH ONE HAS DREAMED

LEATHER BED OH THESE ARE THE VERITABLE PINCERS REDDENED IN THE FIRES
OF HELL

IMPOSED UPON YOU FOR LONG NIGHTS BY YOUR BURNING ARTERIES YOUR BURSTING

HAVE PITY UPON ME
THE PRIEST WRITHED ON THE WET PAVEMENT BEATING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE
CORNERS OF THE STONE STEPS
THE YOUNG GIRL GAZED AT HIM AND LISTENED TO
HIM
WHEN HE CEASED EXHAUSTED AND PANTING SHE REPEATED IN A LOW VOICE
OH MY PHOEBUS
THE PRIEST DRAGGED HIMSELF TOWARDS HER ON HIS KNEES
I BESEECH YOU HE CRIED IF YOU HAVE ANY HEART DO NOT REPULSE ME
OH I LOVE YOU I AM A WRETCH WHEN YOU UTTER THAT NAME UNHAPPY GIRL

SOULS INTO EACH OTHER AND WE WOULD HAVE A THIRST FOR OURSELVES WHICH WE
WOULD QUENCH IN COMMON AND INCESSANTLY AT THAT FOUNTAIN OF INEXHAUSTIBLE
LOVE
SHE INTERRUPTED WITH A TERRIBLE AND THRILLING LAUGH

EYES FIXED UPON HIS HAND

POINT

THE PRIEST HAD STUMBLED ON THE STAIRS
HE SILENTLY DISENTANGLED HIS
FEET FROM THE FOLDS OF HIS ROBE PICKED UP HIS LANTERN AGAIN AND SLOWLY
BEGAN THE ASCENT OF THE STEPS WHICH LED TO THE DOOR HE OPENED THE DOOR
AND PASSED THROUGH IT
ALL AT ONCE THE YOUNG GIRL BEHELD HIS HEAD REAPPEAR IT WORE A
FRIGHTFUL EXPRESSION AND HE CRIED HOARSE WITH RAGE AND DESPAIR
I TELL YOU HE IS DEAD
SHE FELL FACE DOWNWARDS UPON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY
SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE CELL THAN THE SOB OF THE DROP OF WATER WHICH MADE
THE POOL PALPITATE AMID THE DARKNESS
CHAPTER V
THE MOTHER
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING SWEETER IN THE WORLD THAN THE
IDEAS WHICH AWAKE IN A MOTHER'S HEART AT THE SIGHT OF HER CHILD'S TINY
SHOE ESPECIALLY IF IT IS A SHOE FOR FESTIVALS FOR SUNDAY FOR BAPTISM
THE SHOE EMBROIDERED TO THE VERY SOLE A SHOE IN WHICH THE INFANT HAS
NOT YET TAKEN A STEP
THAT SHOE HAS SO MUCH GRACE AND DAINTINESS IT IS
SO IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO WALK THAT IT SEEMS TO THE MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE
SAW HER CHILD
SHE SMILES UPON IT SHE KISSES IT SHE TALKS TO IT SHE
ASKS HERSELF WHETHER THERE CAN ACTUALLY BE A FOOT SO TINY AND IF THE
CHILD BE ABSENT THE PRETTY SHOE SUFFICES TO PLACE THE SWEET AND FRAGILE
CREATURE BEFORE HER EYES
SHE THINKS SHE SEES IT SHE DOES SEE IT
COMPLETE LIVING JOYOUS WITH ITS DELICATE HANDS ITS ROUND HEAD ITS
PURE LIPS ITS SERENE EYES WHOSE WHITE IS BLUE
IF IT IS IN WINTER IT
IS YONDER CRAWLING ON THE CARPET IT IS LABORIOUSLY CLIMBING UPON AN
OTTOMAN AND THE MOTHER TREMBLES LEST IT SHOULD APPROACH THE FIRE
IF IT
IS SUMMER TIME IT CRAWLS ABOUT THE YARD IN THE GARDEN PLUCKS UP THE
GRASS BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES GAZES INNOCENTLY AT THE BIG DOGS THE
BIG HORSES WITHOUT FEAR PLAYS WITH THE SHELLS WITH THE FLOWERS AND
MAKES THE GARDENER GRUMBLE BECAUSE HE FINDS SAND IN THE FLOWER BEDS AND
EARTH IN THE PATHS
EVERYTHING LAUGHS AND SHINES AND PLAYS AROUND IT
LIKE IT EVEN THE BREATH OF AIR AND THE RAY OF SUN WHICH VIE WITH EACH
OTHER IN DISPORTING AMONG THE SILKY RINGLETS OF ITS HAIR
THE SHOE SHOWS
ALL THIS TO THE MOTHER AND MAKES HER HEART MELT AS FIRE MELTS WAX
BUT WHEN THE CHILD IS LOST THESE THOUSAND IMAGES OF JOY OF CHARMS OF
TENDERNESS WHICH THRONG AROUND THE LITTLE SHOE BECOME SO MANY
HORRIBLE THINGS
THE PRETTY BROIDERED SHOE IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT AN
INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE WHICH ETERNALLY CRUSHES THE HEART OF THE MOTHER
IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME FIBRE WHICH VIBRATES THE TENDEREST AND MOST
SENSITIVE BUT INSTEAD OF AN ANGEL CARESSING IT IT IS A DEMON WHO IS
WRENCHING AT IT
ONE MAY MORNING WHEN THE SUN WAS RISING ON ONE OF THOSE DARK BLUE SKIES
AGAINST WHICH GAROFOLO LOVES TO PLACE HIS DESCENTS FROM THE CROSS THE
RECLUSE OF THE TOUR ROLAND HEARD A SOUND OF WHEELS OF HORSES AND IRONS
IN THE PLACE DE GRVE
SHE WAS SOMEWHAT AROUSED BY IT KNOTTED HER HAIR
UPON HER EARS IN ORDER TO DEAFEN HERSELF AND RESUMED HER CONTEMPLATION
ON HER KNEES OF THE INANIMATE OBJECT WHICH SHE HAD ADORED FOR FIFTEEN
YEARS
THIS LITTLE SHOE WAS THE UNIVERSE TO HER AS WE HAVE ALREADY
SAID
HER THOUGHT WAS SHUT UP IN IT AND WAS DESTINED NEVER MORE TO QUIT
IT EXCEPT AT DEATH
THE SOMBRE CAVE OF THE TOUR ROLAND ALONE KNEW HOW
MANY BITTER IMPRECATIONS TOUCHING COMPLAINTS PRAYERS AND SOBS SHE HAD
WAFTED TO HEAVEN IN CONNECTION WITH THAT CHARMING BAUBLE OF ROSE COLORED
SATIN
NEVER WAS MORE DESPAIR BESTOWED UPON A PRETTIER AND MORE GRACEFUL
THING
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HER GRIEF WERE BREAKING FORTH MORE VIOLENTLY THAN
USUAL AND SHE COULD BE HEARD OUTSIDE LAMENTING IN A LOUD AND MONOTONOUS
VOICE WHICH RENT THE HEART
OH MY DAUGHTER SHE SAID MY DAUGHTER MY POOR DEAR LITTLE CHILD SO
I SHALL NEVER SEE THEE MORE IT IS OVER IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO ME THAT IT
HAPPENED YESTERDAY MY GOD MY GOD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER NOT TO
GIVE HER TO ME THAN TO TAKE HER AWAY SO SOON
DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT OUR
CHILDREN ARE PART OF OURSELVES AND THAT A MOTHER WHO HAS LOST HER CHILD
NO LONGER BELIEVES IN GOD AH WRETCH THAT I AM TO HAVE GONE OUT THAT
DAY LORD LORD TO HAVE TAKEN HER FROM ME THUS YOU COULD NEVER HAVE
LOOKED AT ME WITH HER WHEN I WAS JOYOUSLY WARMING HER AT MY FIRE WHEN
SHE LAUGHED AS SHE SUCKLED WHEN I MADE HER TINY FEET CREEP UP MY BREAST
TO MY LIPS OH IF YOU HAD LOOKED AT THAT MY GOD YOU WOULD HAVE TAKEN
PITY ON MY JOY YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN FROM ME THE ONLY LOVE WHICH
LINGERED IN MY HEART WAS I THEN LORD SO MISERABLE A CREATURE THAT
YOU COULD NOT LOOK AT ME BEFORE CONDEMNING ME ALAS ALAS HERE IS
THE SHOE WHERE IS THE FOOT WHERE IS THE REST WHERE IS THE CHILD MY
DAUGHTER MY DAUGHTER WHAT DID THEY DO WITH THEE LORD GIVE HER BACK
TO ME
MY KNEES HAVE BEEN WORN FOR FIFTEEN YEARS IN PRAYING TO THEE
MY GOD IS NOT THAT ENOUGH GIVE HER BACK TO ME ONE DAY ONE HOUR
ONE MINUTE ONE MINUTE LORD AND THEN CAST ME TO THE DEMON FOR ALL
ETERNITY OH IF I ONLY KNEW WHERE THE SKIRT OF YOUR GARMENT TRAILS I
WOULD CLING TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AND YOU WOULD BE OBLIGED TO GIVE ME
BACK MY CHILD HAVE YOU NO PITY ON HER PRETTY LITTLE SHOE COULD YOU
CONDEMN A POOR MOTHER TO THIS TORTURE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS GOOD VIRGIN
GOOD VIRGIN OF HEAVEN MY INFANT JESUS HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM ME HAS BEEN
STOLEN FROM ME THEY DEVOURED HER ON A HEATH THEY DRANK HER BLOOD THEY
CRACKED HER BONES GOOD VIRGIN HAVE PITY UPON ME
MY DAUGHTER I WANT
MY DAUGHTER WHAT IS IT TO ME THAT SHE IS IN PARADISE I DO NOT WANT
YOUR ANGEL I WANT MY CHILD I AM A LIONESS I WANT MY WHELP
OH I WILL
WRITHE ON THE EARTH I WILL BREAK THE STONES WITH MY FOREHEAD AND I
WILL DAMN MYSELF AND I WILL CURSE YOU LORD IF YOU KEEP MY CHILD FROM
ME YOU SEE PLAINLY THAT MY ARMS ARE ALL BITTEN LORD HAS THE GOOD GOD
NO MERCY OH GIVE ME ONLY SALT AND BLACK BREAD ONLY LET ME HAVE MY
DAUGHTER TO WARM ME LIKE A SUN ALAS LORD MY GOD
ALAS LORD MY GOD
I AM ONLY A VILE SINNER BUT MY DAUGHTER MADE ME PIOUS
I WAS FULL OF
RELIGION FOR THE LOVE OF HER AND I BEHELD YOU THROUGH HER SMILE AS
THROUGH AN OPENING INTO HEAVEN
OH IF I COULD ONLY ONCE JUST ONCE
MORE A SINGLE TIME PUT THIS SHOE ON HER PRETTY LITTLE PINK FOOT I
WOULD DIE BLESSING YOU GOOD VIRGIN
AH FIFTEEN YEARS SHE WILL BE
GROWN UP NOW UNHAPPY CHILD WHAT IT IS REALLY TRUE THEN I SHALL NEVER
SEE HER MORE NOT EVEN IN HEAVEN FOR I SHALL NOT GO THERE MYSELF
OH
WHAT MISERY TO THINK THAT HERE IS HER SHOE AND THAT THAT IS ALL
THE UNHAPPY WOMAN FLUNG HERSELF UPON THAT SHOE HER CONSOLATION AND HER
DESPAIR FOR SO MANY YEARS AND HER VITALS WERE RENT WITH SOBS AS ON THE
FIRST DAY BECAUSE FOR A MOTHER WHO HAS LOST HER CHILD IT IS ALWAYS
THE FIRST DAY
THAT GRIEF NEVER GROWS OLD
THE MOURNING GARMENTS MAY
GROW WHITE AND THREADBARE THE HEART REMAINS DARK
AT THAT MOMENT THE FRESH AND JOYOUS CRIES OF CHILDREN PASSED IN FRONT
OF THE CELL
EVERY TIME THAT CHILDREN CROSSED HER VISION OR STRUCK
HER EAR THE POOR MOTHER FLUNG HERSELF INTO THE DARKEST CORNER OF HER
SEPULCHRE AND ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT SHE SOUGHT TO PLUNGE HER HEAD
INTO THE STONE IN ORDER NOT TO HEAR THEM
THIS TIME ON THE CONTRARY
SHE DREW HERSELF UPRIGHT WITH A START AND LISTENED EAGERLY
ONE OF THE
LITTLE BOYS HAD JUST SAID
THEY ARE GOING TO HANG A GYPSY TO DAY
WITH THE ABRUPT LEAP OF THAT SPIDER WHICH WE HAVE SEEN FLING ITSELF UPON
A FLY AT THE TREMBLING OF ITS WEB SHE RUSHED TO HER AIR HOLE WHICH
OPENED AS THE READER KNOWS ON THE PLACE DE GRVE
A LADDER HAD IN
FACT BEEN RAISED UP AGAINST THE PERMANENT GIBBET AND THE HANGMAN'S
ASSISTANT WAS BUSYING HIMSELF WITH ADJUSTING THE CHAINS WHICH HAD BEEN
RUSTED BY THE RAIN
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE STANDING ABOUT
THE LAUGHING GROUP OF CHILDREN WAS ALREADY FAR AWAY
THE SACKED NUN
SOUGHT WITH HER EYES SOME PASSER BY WHOM SHE MIGHT QUESTION
ALL AT
ONCE BESIDE HER CELL SHE PERCEIVED A PRIEST MAKING A PRETEXT OF
READING THE PUBLIC BREVIARY BUT WHO WAS MUCH LESS OCCUPIED WITH THE
LECTERN OF LATTICED IRON THAN WITH THE GALLOWS TOWARD WHICH HE CAST
A FIERCE AND GLOOMY GLANCE FROM TIME TO TIME
SHE RECOGNIZED MONSIEUR
THE ARCHDEACON OF JOSAS A HOLY MAN
FATHER SHE INQUIRED WHOM ARE THEY ABOUT TO HANG YONDER
THE PRIEST LOOKED AT HER AND MADE NO REPLY SHE REPEATED HER QUESTION
THEN HE SAID
I KNOW NOT
SOME CHILDREN SAID THAT IT WAS A GYPSY WENT ON THE RECLUSE
I BELIEVE SO SAID THE PRIEST
THEN PAQUETTE LA CHANTEFLEURIE BURST INTO HYENA LIKE LAUGHTER
SISTER SAID THE ARCHDEACON DO YOU THEN HATE THE GYPSIES HEARTILY
DO I HATE THEM EXCLAIMED THE RECLUSE THEY ARE VAMPIRES STEALERS
OF CHILDREN THEY DEVOURED MY LITTLE DAUGHTER MY CHILD MY ONLY CHILD
I HAVE NO LONGER ANY HEART THEY DEVOURED IT
SHE WAS FRIGHTFUL
THE PRIEST LOOKED AT HER COLDLY
THERE IS ONE IN PARTICULAR WHOM I HATE AND WHOM I HAVE CURSED SHE
RESUMED IT IS A YOUNG ONE OF THE AGE WHICH MY DAUGHTER WOULD BE IF
HER MOTHER HAD NOT EATEN MY DAUGHTER
EVERY TIME THAT THAT YOUNG VIPER
PASSES IN FRONT OF MY CELL SHE SETS MY BLOOD IN A FERMENT
WELL SISTER REJOICE SAID THE PRIEST ICY AS A SEPULCHRAL STATUE
THAT IS THE ONE WHOM YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE DIE
HIS HEAD FELL UPON HIS BOSOM AND HE MOVED SLOWLY AWAY
THE RECLUSE WRITHED HER ARMS WITH JOY
I PREDICTED IT FOR HER THAT SHE WOULD ASCEND THITHER THANKS PRIEST
SHE CRIED
AND SHE BEGAN TO PACE UP AND DOWN WITH LONG STRIDES BEFORE THE GRATING
OF HER WINDOW HER HAIR DISHEVELLED HER EYES FLASHING WITH HER
SHOULDER STRIKING AGAINST THE WALL WITH THE WILD AIR OF A FEMALE WOLF
IN A CAGE WHO HAS LONG BEEN FAMISHED AND WHO FEELS THE HOUR FOR HER
REPAST DRAWING NEAR
CHAPTER VI
THREE HUMAN HEARTS DIFFERENTLY CONSTRUCTED
PHOEBUS WAS NOT DEAD HOWEVER
MEN OF THAT STAMP DIE HARD
WHEN MASTER
PHILIPPE LHEULIER ADVOCATE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE KING HAD SAID TO POOR
ESMERALDA HE IS DYING IT WAS AN ERROR OR A JEST
WHEN THE ARCHDEACON
HAD REPEATED TO THE CONDEMNED GIRL HE IS DEAD THE FACT IS THAT HE
KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT THAT HE BELIEVED IT THAT HE COUNTED ON IT
THAT HE DID NOT DOUBT IT THAT HE DEVOUTLY HOPED IT
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
TOO HARD FOR HIM TO GIVE FAVORABLE NEWS OF HIS RIVAL TO THE WOMAN WHOM
HE LOVED
ANY MAN WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME IN HIS PLACE
IT WAS NOT THAT PHOEBUS'S WOUND HAD NOT BEEN SERIOUS BUT IT HAD NOT
BEEN AS MUCH SO AS THE ARCHDEACON BELIEVED
THE PHYSICIAN TO WHOM THE
SOLDIERS OF THE WATCH HAD CARRIED HIM AT THE FIRST MOMENT HAD FEARED
FOR HIS LIFE DURING THE SPACE OF A WEEK AND HAD EVEN TOLD HIM SO IN
LATIN
BUT YOUTH HAD GAINED THE UPPER HAND AND AS FREQUENTLY HAPPENS
IN SPITE OF PROGNOSTICATIONS AND DIAGNOSES NATURE HAD AMUSED HERSELF BY
SAVING THE SICK MAN UNDER THE PHYSICIAN'S VERY NOSE
IT WAS WHILE HE
WAS STILL LYING ON THE LEECH'S PALLET THAT HE HAD SUBMITTED TO THE
INTERROGATIONS OF PHILIPPE LHEULIER AND THE OFFICIAL INQUISITORS
WHICH HAD ANNOYED HIM GREATLY
HENCE ONE FINE MORNING FEELING HIMSELF
BETTER HE HAD LEFT HIS GOLDEN SPURS WITH THE LEECH AS PAYMENT AND HAD
SLIPPED AWAY
THIS HAD NOT HOWEVER INTERFERED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE
AFFAIR
JUSTICE AT THAT EPOCH TROUBLED ITSELF VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE
CLEARNESS AND DEFINITENESS OF A CRIMINAL SUIT
PROVIDED THAT THE ACCUSED
WAS HUNG THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY
NOW THE JUDGE HAD PLENTY OF
PROOFS AGAINST LA ESMERALDA
THEY HAD SUPPOSED PHOEBUS TO BE DEAD AND
THAT WAS THE END OF THE MATTER
PHOEBUS ON HIS SIDE HAD NOT FLED FAR
HE HAD SIMPLY REJOINED HIS
COMPANY IN GARRISON AT QUEUE EN BRIE IN THE ISLE DE FRANCE A FEW
STAGES FROM PARIS
AFTER ALL IT DID NOT PLEASE HIM IN THE LEAST TO APPEAR IN THIS SUIT
HE HAD A VAGUE FEELING THAT HE SHOULD PLAY A RIDICULOUS FIGURE IN IT
ON THE WHOLE HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
SUPERSTITIOUS AND NOT GIVEN TO DEVOUTNESS LIKE EVERY SOLDIER WHO IS
ONLY A SOLDIER WHEN HE CAME TO QUESTION HIMSELF ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
HE DID NOT FEEL ASSURED AS TO THE GOAT AS TO THE SINGULAR FASHION IN
WHICH HE HAD MET LA ESMERALDA AS TO THE NO LESS STRANGE MANNER IN WHICH
SHE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO DIVINE HER LOVE AS TO HER CHARACTER AS A GYPSY
AND LASTLY AS TO THE SURLY MONK
HE PERCEIVED IN ALL THESE INCIDENTS
MUCH MORE MAGIC THAN LOVE PROBABLY A SORCERESS PERHAPS THE DEVIL
A COMEDY IN SHORT OR TO SPEAK IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT DAY A VERY
DISAGREEABLE MYSTERY IN WHICH HE PLAYED A VERY AWKWARD PART THE ROLE
OF BLOWS AND DERISION
THE CAPTAIN WAS QUITE PUT OUT OF COUNTENANCE
ABOUT IT HE EXPERIENCED THAT SORT OF SHAME WHICH OUR LA FONTAINE HAS SO
ADMIRABLY DEFINED
ASHAMED AS A FOX WHO HAS BEEN CAUGHT BY A FOWL
MOREOVER HE HOPED THAT THE AFFAIR WOULD NOT GET NOISED ABROAD THAT HIS
NAME WOULD HARDLY BE PRONOUNCED IN IT AND THAT IN ANY CASE IT WOULD
NOT GO BEYOND THE COURTS OF THE TOURNELLE
IN THIS HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN
THERE WAS THEN NO GAZETTE DES TRIBUNAUX AND AS NOT A WEEK PASSED
WHICH HAD NOT ITS COUNTERFEITER TO BOIL OR ITS WITCH TO HANG OR ITS
HERETIC TO BURN AT SOME ONE OF THE INNUMERABLE JUSTICES OF PARIS
PEOPLE WERE SO ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING IN ALL THE SQUARES THE ANCIENT
FEUDAL THEMIS BARE ARMED WITH SLEEVES STRIPPED UP PERFORMING HER DUTY
AT THE GIBBETS THE LADDERS AND THE PILLORIES THAT THEY HARDLY PAID
ANY HEED TO IT
FASHIONABLE SOCIETY OF THAT DAY HARDLY KNEW THE NAME
OF THE VICTIM WHO PASSED BY AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND IT WAS THE
POPULACE AT THE MOST WHO REGALED THEMSELVES WITH THIS COARSE FARE
AN
EXECUTION WAS AN HABITUAL INCIDENT OF THE PUBLIC HIGHWAYS LIKE THE
BRAISING PAN OF THE BAKER OR THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE OF THE KNACKER
THE
EXECUTIONER WAS ONLY A SORT OF BUTCHER OF A LITTLE DEEPER DYE THAN THE
REST
HENCE PHOEBUS'S MIND WAS SOON AT EASE ON THE SCORE OF THE ENCHANTRESS
ESMERALDA OR SIMILAR AS HE CALLED HER CONCERNING THE BLOW FROM THE
DAGGER OF THE BOHEMIAN OR OF THE SURLY MONK IT MATTERED LITTLE WHICH
TO HIM AND AS TO THE ISSUE OF THE TRIAL
BUT AS SOON AS HIS HEART WAS
VACANT IN THAT DIRECTION FLEUR DE LYS RETURNED TO IT
CAPTAIN PHOEBUS'S
HEART LIKE THE PHYSICS OF THAT DAY ABHORRED A VACUUM
QUEUE EN BRIE WAS A VERY INSIPID PLACE TO STAY AT THEN A VILLAGE
OF FARRIERS AND COW GIRLS WITH CHAPPED HANDS A LONG LINE OF POOR
DWELLINGS AND THATCHED COTTAGES WHICH BORDERS THE GRAND ROAD ON BOTH
SIDES FOR HALF A LEAGUE A TAIL QUEUE IN SHORT AS ITS NAME IMPORTS
FLEUR DE LYS WAS HIS LAST PASSION BUT ONE A PRETTY GIRL A CHARMING
DOWRY ACCORDINGLY ONE FINE MORNING QUITE CURED AND ASSUMING THAT
AFTER THE LAPSE OF TWO MONTHS THE BOHEMIAN AFFAIR MUST BE COMPLETELY
FINISHED AND FORGOTTEN THE AMOROUS CAVALIER ARRIVED ON A PRANCING HORSE
AT THE DOOR OF THE GONDELAURIER MANSION
HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO A TOLERABLY NUMEROUS RABBLE WHICH HAD ASSEMBLED
IN THE PLACE DU PARVIS BEFORE THE PORTAL OF NOTRE DAME HE REMEMBERED
THAT IT WAS THE MONTH OF MAY HE SUPPOSED THAT IT WAS SOME PROCESSION
SOME PENTECOST SOME FESTIVAL HITCHED HIS HORSE TO THE RING AT THE
DOOR AND GAYLY ASCENDED THE STAIRS TO HIS BEAUTIFUL BETROTHED
SHE WAS ALONE WITH HER MOTHER
THE SCENE OF THE WITCH HER GOAT HER CURSED ALPHABET AND PHOEBUS'S
LONG ABSENCES STILL WEIGHED ON FLEUR DE LYS'S HEART
NEVERTHELESS WHEN
SHE BEHELD HER CAPTAIN ENTER SHE THOUGHT HIM SO HANDSOME HIS DOUBLET
SO NEW HIS BALDRICK SO SHINING AND HIS AIR SO IMPASSIONED THAT SHE
BLUSHED WITH PLEASURE
THE NOBLE DAMSEL HERSELF WAS MORE CHARMING THAN
EVER
HER MAGNIFICENT BLOND HAIR WAS PLAITED IN A RAVISHING MANNER SHE
WAS DRESSED ENTIRELY IN THAT SKY BLUE WHICH BECOMES FAIR PEOPLE SO WELL
A BIT OF COQUETRY WHICH SHE HAD LEARNED FROM COLOMBE AND HER EYES WERE
SWIMMING IN THAT LANGUOR OF LOVE WHICH BECOMES THEM STILL BETTER
PHOEBUS WHO HAD SEEN NOTHING IN THE LINE OF BEAUTY SINCE HE LEFT THE
VILLAGE MAIDS OF QUEUE EN BRIE WAS INTOXICATED WITH FLEUR DE LYS WHICH
IMPARTED TO OUR OFFICER SO EAGER AND GALLANT AN AIR THAT HIS PEACE
WAS IMMEDIATELY MADE
MADAME DE GONDELAURIER HERSELF STILL MATERNALLY
SEATED IN HER BIG ARM CHAIR HAD NOT THE HEART TO SCOLD HIM
AS FOR
FLEUR DE LYS'S REPROACHES THEY EXPIRED IN TENDER COOINGS
THE YOUNG GIRL WAS SEATED NEAR THE WINDOW STILL EMBROIDERING HER GROTTO
OF NEPTUNE
THE CAPTAIN WAS LEANING OVER THE BACK OF HER CHAIR AND SHE
WAS ADDRESSING HER CARESSING REPROACHES TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE
WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOU THESE TWO LONG MONTHS WICKED MAN
I SWEAR TO YOU REPLIED PHOEBUS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED BY THE QUESTION
THAT YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH TO SET AN ARCHBISHOP TO DREAMING
SHE COULD NOT REPRESS A SMILE
GOOD GOOD SIR
LET MY BEAUTY ALONE AND ANSWER MY QUESTION
A FINE
BEAUTY IN SOOTH
WELL MY DEAR COUSIN I WAS RECALLED TO THE GARRISON
AND WHERE IS THAT IF YOU PLEASE AND WHY DID NOT YOU COME TO SAY
FAREWELL
AT QUEUE EN BRIE
PHOEBUS WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH HELPED HIM TO AVOID
THE SECOND
BUT THAT IS QUITE CLOSE BY MONSIEUR
WHY DID YOU NOT COME TO SEE ME A
SINGLE TIME
HERE PHOEBUS WAS RATHER SERIOUSLY EMBARRASSED
BECAUSE THE SERVICE AND THEN CHARMING COUSIN I HAVE BEEN ILL
ILL SHE REPEATED IN ALARM
YES WOUNDED
WOUNDED
SHE POOR CHILD WAS COMPLETELY UPSET
OH DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED AT THAT SAID PHOEBUS CARELESSLY IT WAS
NOTHING
A QUARREL A SWORD CUT WHAT IS THAT TO YOU
WHAT IS THAT TO ME EXCLAIMED FLEUR DE LYS RAISING HER BEAUTIFUL EYES
FILLED WITH TEARS
OH YOU DO NOT SAY WHAT YOU THINK WHEN YOU SPEAK
THUS
WHAT SWORD CUT WAS THAT I WISH TO KNOW ALL
WELL MY DEAR FAIR ONE I HAD A FALLING OUT WITH MAH FDY YOU KNOW
THE LIEUTENANT OF SAINT GERMAIN EN LAYE AND WE RIPPED OPEN A FEW INCHES
OF SKIN FOR EACH OTHER
THAT IS ALL
THE MENDACIOUS CAPTAIN WAS PERFECTLY WELL AWARE THAT AN AFFAIR OF
HONOR ALWAYS MAKES A MAN STAND WELL IN THE EYES OF A WOMAN
IN FACT
FLEUR DE LYS LOOKED HIM FULL IN THE FACE ALL AGITATED WITH FEAR
PLEASURE AND ADMIRATION
STILL SHE WAS NOT COMPLETELY REASSURED
PROVIDED THAT YOU ARE WHOLLY CURED MY PHOEBUS SAID SHE
I DO NOT
KNOW YOUR MAH FDY BUT HE IS A VILLANOUS MAN
AND WHENCE AROSE THIS
QUARREL
HERE PHOEBUS WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS ENDOWED WITH BUT MEDIOCRE POWER
OF CREATION BEGAN TO FIND HIMSELF IN A QUANDARY AS TO A MEANS OF
EXTRICATING HIMSELF FOR HIS PROWESS
OH HOW DO I KNOW A MERE NOTHING A HORSE A REMARK FAIR COUSIN
HE EXCLAIMED FOR THE SAKE OF CHANGING THE CONVERSATION WHAT NOISE IS
THIS IN THE CATHEDRAL SQUARE
HE APPROACHED THE WINDOW
OH MON DIEU FAIR COUSIN HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE ON THE PLACE
I KNOW NOT SAID FLEUR DE LYS IT APPEARS THAT A WITCH IS TO DO
PENANCE THIS MORNING BEFORE THE CHURCH AND THEREAFTER TO BE HUNG
THE CAPTAIN WAS SO THOROUGHLY PERSUADED THAT LA ESMERALDA'S AFFAIR WAS
CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS BUT LITTLE DISTURBED BY FLEUR DE LYS'S WORDS
STILL HE ASKED HER ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS WITCH
I DO NOT KNOW SHE REPLIED
AND WHAT IS SHE SAID TO HAVE DONE
SHE SHRUGGED HER WHITE SHOULDERS
I KNOW NOT
OH MON DIEU JESUS SAID HER MOTHER THERE ARE SO MANY WITCHES
NOWADAYS THAT I DARE SAY THEY BURN THEM WITHOUT KNOWING THEIR NAMES
ONE
MIGHT AS WELL SEEK THE NAME OF EVERY CLOUD IN THE SKY
AFTER ALL ONE
MAY BE TRANQUIL
THE GOOD GOD KEEPS HIS REGISTER HERE THE VENERABLE
DAME ROSE AND CAME TO THE WINDOW
GOOD LORD YOU ARE RIGHT PHOEBUS
SAID SHE
THE RABBLE IS INDEED GREAT
THERE ARE PEOPLE ON ALL THE
ROOFS BLESSED BE GOD DO YOU KNOW PHOEBUS THIS REMINDS ME OF MY BEST
DAYS
THE ENTRANCE OF KING CHARLES VII WHEN ALSO THERE WERE MANY
PEOPLE
I NO LONGER REMEMBER IN WHAT YEAR THAT WAS
WHEN I SPEAK OF THIS
TO YOU IT PRODUCES UPON YOU THE EFFECT DOES IT NOT THE EFFECT OF
SOMETHING VERY OLD AND UPON ME OF SOMETHING VERY YOUNG
OH THE
CROWD WAS FAR FINER THAN AT THE PRESENT DAY
THEY EVEN STOOD UPON THE
MACHICOLATIONS OF THE PORTE SAINTE ANTOINE
THE KING HAD THE QUEEN ON A
PILLION AND AFTER THEIR HIGHNESSES CAME ALL THE LADIES MOUNTED BEHIND
ALL THE LORDS
I REMEMBER THAT THEY LAUGHED LOUDLY BECAUSE BESIDE
AMANYON DE GARLANDE WHO WAS VERY SHORT OF STATURE THERE RODE THE
SIRE MATEFELON A CHEVALIER OF GIGANTIC SIZE WHO HAD KILLED HEAPS OF
ENGLISH
IT WAS VERY FINE
A PROCESSION OF ALL THE GENTLEMEN OF FRANCE
WITH THEIR ORIFLAMMES WAVING RED BEFORE THE EYE
THERE WERE SOME WITH
PENNONS AND SOME WITH BANNERS
HOW CAN I TELL THE SIRE DE CALM WITH A
PENNON JEAN DE CHTEAUMORANT WITH A BANNER THE SIRE DE COURCY WITH A
BANNER AND A MORE AMPLE ONE THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS EXCEPT THE DUC DE
BOURBON
ALAS 'TIS A SAD THING TO THINK THAT ALL THAT HAS EXISTED AND
EXISTS NO LONGER
THE TWO LOVERS WERE NOT LISTENING TO THE VENERABLE DOWAGER
PHOEBUS
HAD RETURNED AND WAS LEANING ON THE BACK OF HIS BETROTHED'S CHAIR A
CHARMING POST WHENCE HIS LIBERTINE GLANCE PLUNGED INTO ALL THE OPENINGS
OF FLEUR DE LYS'S GORGET
THIS GORGET GAPED SO CONVENIENTLY AND ALLOWED
HIM TO SEE SO MANY EXQUISITE THINGS AND TO DIVINE SO MANY MORE THAT
PHOEBUS DAZZLED BY THIS SKIN WITH ITS GLEAMS OF SATIN SAID TO HIMSELF
HOW CAN ANY ONE LOVE ANYTHING BUT A FAIR SKIN
BOTH WERE SILENT
THE YOUNG GIRL RAISED SWEET ENRAPTURED EYES TO HIM
FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEIR HAIR MINGLED IN A RAY OF SPRING SUNSHINE
PHOEBUS SAID FLEUR DE LYS SUDDENLY IN A LOW VOICE WE ARE TO BE
MARRIED THREE MONTHS HENCE SWEAR TO ME THAT YOU HAVE NEVER LOVED ANY
OTHER WOMAN THAN MYSELF
I SWEAR IT FAIR ANGEL REPLIED PHOEBUS AND HIS PASSIONATE GLANCES
AIDED THE SINCERE TONE OF HIS VOICE IN CONVINCING FLEUR DE LYS
MEANWHILE THE GOOD MOTHER CHARMED TO SEE THE BETROTHED PAIR ON TERMS
OF SUCH PERFECT UNDERSTANDING HAD JUST QUITTED THE APARTMENT TO ATTEND
TO SOME DOMESTIC MATTER PHOEBUS OBSERVED IT AND THIS SO EMBOLDENED
THE ADVENTUROUS CAPTAIN THAT VERY STRANGE IDEAS MOUNTED TO HIS BRAIN
FLEUR DE LYS LOVED HIM HE WAS HER BETROTHED SHE WAS ALONE WITH HIM
HIS FORMER TASTE FOR HER HAD RE AWAKENED NOT WITH ALL ITS FRESH NESS
BUT WITH ALL ITS ARDOR AFTER ALL THERE IS NO GREAT HARM IN TASTING
ONE'S WHEAT WHILE IT IS STILL IN THE BLADE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER
THESE IDEAS PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT
FLEUR DE LYS WAS SUDDENLY ALARMED BY THE EXPRESSION OF HIS GLANCE
SHE
LOOKED ROUND AND SAW THAT HER MOTHER WAS NO LONGER THERE
GOOD HEAVENS SAID SHE BLUSHING AND UNEASY HOW VERY WARM I AM
I THINK IN FACT REPLIED PHOEBUS THAT IT CANNOT BE FAR FROM MIDDAY
THE SUN IS TROUBLESOME
WE NEED ONLY LOWER THE CURTAINS
NO NO EXCLAIMED THE POOR LITTLE THING ON THE CONTRARY I NEED
AIR
AND LIKE A FAWN WHO FEELS THE BREATH OF THE PACK OF HOUNDS SHE ROSE
RAN TO THE WINDOW OPENED IT AND RUSHED UPON THE BALCONY
PHOEBUS MUCH DISCOMFITED FOLLOWED HER
THE PLACE DU PARVIS NOTRE DAME UPON WHICH THE BALCONY LOOKED AS THE
READER KNOWS PRESENTED AT THAT MOMENT A SINGULAR AND SINISTER SPECTACLE
WHICH CAUSED THE FRIGHT OF THE TIMID FLEUR DE LYS TO CHANGE ITS NATURE
AN IMMENSE CROWD WHICH OVERFLOWED INTO ALL THE NEIGHBORING STREETS
ENCUMBERED THE PLACE PROPERLY SPEAKING
THE LITTLE WALL BREAST HIGH
WHICH SURROUNDED THE PLACE WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICED TO KEEP IT FREE
HAD IT NOT BEEN LINED WITH A THICK HEDGE OF SERGEANTS AND HACKBUTEERS
CULVERINES IN HAND
THANKS TO THIS THICKET OF PIKES AND ARQUEBUSES THE
PARVIS WAS EMPTY
ITS ENTRANCE WAS GUARDED BY A FORCE OF HALBERDIERS
WITH THE ARMORIAL BEARINGS OF THE BISHOP
THE LARGE DOORS OF THE CHURCH
WERE CLOSED AND FORMED A CONTRAST WITH THE INNUMERABLE WINDOWS ON THE
PLACE WHICH OPEN TO THEIR VERY GABLES ALLOWED A VIEW OF THOUSANDS OF
HEADS HEAPED UP ALMOST LIKE THE PILES OF BULLETS IN A PARK OF ARTILLERY
THE SURFACE OF THIS RABBLE WAS DINGY DIRTY EARTHY
THE SPECTACLE
WHICH IT WAS EXPECTING WAS EVIDENTLY ONE OF THE SORT WHICH POSSESS THE
PRIVILEGE OF BRINGING OUT AND CALLING TOGETHER THE VILEST AMONG THE
POPULACE
NOTHING IS SO HIDEOUS AS THE NOISE WHICH WAS MADE BY THAT
SWARM OF YELLOW CAPS AND DIRTY HEADS
IN THAT THRONG THERE WERE MORE
LAUGHS THAN CRIES MORE WOMEN THAN MEN
FROM TIME TO TIME A SHARP AND VIBRATING VOICE PIERCED THE GENERAL
CLAMOR
OH MAHIET BALIFFRE IS SHE TO BE HUNG YONDER
FOOL T'IS HERE THAT SHE IS TO MAKE HER APOLOGY IN HER SHIFT THE GOOD
GOD IS GOING TO COUGH LATIN IN HER FACE THAT IS ALWAYS DONE HERE AT
MIDDAY
IF 'TIS THE GALLOWS THAT YOU WISH GO TO THE GRVE
I WILL GO THERE AFTERWARDS
TELL ME LA BOUCANBRY IS IT TRUE THAT SHE HAS REFUSED A CONFESSOR
IT APPEARS SO LA BECHAIGNE
YOU SEE WHAT A PAGAN SHE IS
'TIS THE CUSTOM MONSIEUR
THE BAILIFF OF THE COURTS IS BOUND TO
DELIVER THE MALEFACTOR READY JUDGED FOR EXECUTION IF HE BE A LAYMAN TO
THE PROVOST OF PARIS IF A CLERK TO THE OFFICIAL OF THE BISHOPRIC
THANK YOU SIR
OH GOD SAID FLEUR DE LYS THE POOR CREATURE
THIS THOUGHT FILLED WITH SADNESS THE GLANCE WHICH SHE CAST UPON THE
POPULACE
THE CAPTAIN MUCH MORE OCCUPIED WITH HER THAN WITH THAT PACK
OF THE RABBLE WAS AMOROUSLY RUMPLING HER GIRDLE BEHIND
SHE TURNED
ROUND ENTREATING AND SMILING
PLEASE LET ME ALONE PHOEBUS IF MY MOTHER WERE TO RETURN SHE WOULD
SEE YOUR HAND
AT THAT MOMENT MIDDAY RANG SLOWLY OUT FROM THE CLOCK OF NOTRE DAME
A
MURMUR OF SATISFACTION BROKE OUT IN THE CROWD
THE LAST VIBRATION OF THE
TWELFTH STROKE HAD HARDLY DIED AWAY WHEN ALL HEADS SURGED LIKE THE WAVES
BENEATH A SQUALL AND AN IMMENSE SHOUT WENT UP FROM THE PAVEMENT THE
WINDOWS AND THE ROOFS
THERE SHE IS
FLEUR DE LYS PRESSED HER HANDS TO HER EYES THAT SHE MIGHT NOT SEE
CHARMING GIRL SAID PHOEBUS DO YOU WISH TO WITHDRAW
NO SHE REPLIED AND SHE OPENED THROUGH CURIOSITY THE EYES WHICH SHE
HAD CLOSED THROUGH FEAR
A TUMBREL DRAWN BY A STOUT NORMAN HORSE AND ALL SURROUNDED BY CAVALRY
IN VIOLET LIVERY WITH WHITE CROSSES HAD JUST DEBOUCHED UPON THE PLACE
THROUGH THE RUE SAINT PIERRE AUX BOEUFS
THE SERGEANTS OF THE WATCH WERE
CLEARING A PASSAGE FOR IT THROUGH THE CROWD BY STOUT BLOWS FROM THEIR
CLUBS
BESIDE THE CART RODE SEVERAL OFFICERS OF JUSTICE AND POLICE
RECOGNIZABLE BY THEIR BLACK COSTUME AND THEIR AWKWARDNESS IN THE SADDLE
MASTER JACQUES CHARMOLUE PARADED AT THEIR HEAD
IN THE FATAL CART SAT A YOUNG GIRL WITH HER ARMS TIED BEHIND HER BACK
AND WITH NO PRIEST BESIDE HER
SHE WAS IN HER SHIFT HER LONG BLACK HAIR
THE FASHION THEN WAS TO CUT IT OFF ONLY AT THE FOOT OF THE GALLOWS
FELL IN DISORDER UPON HER HALF BARED THROAT AND SHOULDERS
ATHWART THAT WAVING HAIR MORE GLOSSY THAN THE PLUMAGE OF A RAVEN A
THICK ROUGH GRAY ROPE WAS VISIBLE TWISTED AND KNOTTED CHAFING HER
DELICATE COLLAR BONES AND TWINING ROUND THE CHARMING NECK OF THE POOR
GIRL LIKE AN EARTHWORM ROUND A FLOWER
BENEATH THAT ROPE GLITTERED A
TINY AMULET ORNAMENTED WITH BITS OF GREEN GLASS WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT TO
HER NO DOUBT BECAUSE NOTHING IS REFUSED TO THOSE WHO ARE ABOUT TO DIE
THE SPECTATORS IN THE WINDOWS COULD SEE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CART HER
NAKED LEGS WHICH SHE STROVE TO HIDE BENEATH HER AS BY A FINAL FEMININE
INSTINCT
AT HER FEET LAY A LITTLE GOAT BOUND
THE CONDEMNED GIRL HELD
TOGETHER WITH HER TEETH HER IMPERFECTLY FASTENED SHIFT
ONE WOULD HAVE
SAID THAT SHE SUFFERED STILL MORE IN HER MISERY FROM BEING THUS EXPOSED
ALMOST NAKED TO THE EYES OF ALL
ALAS MODESTY IS NOT MADE FOR SUCH
SHOCKS
JESUS SAID FLEUR DE LYS HASTILY TO THE CAPTAIN
LOOK FAIR COUSIN
'TIS THAT WRETCHED BOHEMIAN WITH THE GOAT
SO SAYING SHE TURNED TO PHOEBUS
HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE TUMBREL
HE
WAS VERY PALE
WHAT BOHEMIAN WITH THE GOAT HE STAMMERED
WHAT RESUMED FLEUR DE LYS DO YOU NOT REMEMBER
PHOEBUS INTERRUPTED HER
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
HE MADE A STEP TO RE ENTER THE ROOM BUT FLEUR DE LYS WHOSE JEALOUSY
PREVIOUSLY SO VIVIDLY AROUSED BY THIS SAME GYPSY HAD JUST BEEN
RE AWAKENED FLEUR DE LYS GAVE HIM A LOOK FULL OF PENETRATION AND
DISTRUST
SHE VAGUELY RECALLED AT THAT MOMENT HAVING HEARD OF A CAPTAIN
MIXED UP IN THE TRIAL OF THAT WITCH
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE SAID TO PHOEBUS ONE WOULD SAY THAT
THIS WOMAN HAD DISTURBED YOU
PHOEBUS FORCED A SNEER
ME NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD AH YES CERTAINLY
REMAIN THEN SHE CONTINUED IMPERIOUSLY AND LET US SEE THE END
THE UNLUCKY CAPTAIN WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN
HE WAS SOMEWHAT REASSURED BY
THE FACT THAT THE CONDEMNED GIRL NEVER REMOVED HER EYES FROM THE BOTTOM
OF THE CART
IT WAS BUT TOO SURELY LA ESMERALDA
IN THIS LAST STAGE OF
OPPROBRIUM AND MISFORTUNE SHE WAS STILL BEAUTIFUL HER GREAT BLACK EYES
APPEARED STILL LARGER BECAUSE OF THE EMACIATION OF HER CHEEKS HER PALE
PROFILE WAS PURE AND SUBLIME
SHE RESEMBLED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN IN
THE SAME DEGREE THAT A VIRGIN BY MASACCIO RESEMBLES A VIRGIN OF
RAPHAEL WEAKER THINNER MORE DELICATE
MOREOVER THERE WAS NOTHING IN HER WHICH WAS NOT SHAKEN IN SOME SORT
AND WHICH WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER MODESTY SHE DID NOT LET GO AT
WILL SO PROFOUNDLY HAD SHE BEEN BROKEN BY STUPOR AND DESPAIR
HER BODY
BOUNDED AT EVERY JOLT OF THE TUMBREL LIKE A DEAD OR BROKEN THING HER
GAZE WAS DULL AND IMBECILE
A TEAR WAS STILL VISIBLE IN HER EYES BUT
MOTIONLESS AND FROZEN SO TO SPEAK
MEANWHILE THE LUGUBRIOUS CAVALCADE HAS TRAVERSED THE CROWD AMID CRIES
OF JOY AND CURIOUS ATTITUDES
BUT AS A FAITHFUL HISTORIAN WE MUST STATE
THAT ON BEHOLDING HER SO BEAUTIFUL SO DEPRESSED MANY WERE MOVED WITH
PITY EVEN AMONG THE HARDEST OF THEM
THE TUMBREL HAD ENTERED THE PARVIS
IT HALTED BEFORE THE CENTRAL PORTAL
THE ESCORT RANGED THEMSELVES IN
LINE ON BOTH SIDES
THE CROWD BECAME SILENT AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS
SILENCE FULL OF ANXIETY AND SOLEMNITY THE TWO LEAVES OF THE GRAND DOOR
SWUNG BACK AS OF THEMSELVES ON THEIR HINGES WHICH GAVE A CREAK LIKE
THE SOUND OF A FIFE
THEN THERE BECAME VISIBLE IN ALL ITS LENGTH THE
DEEP GLOOMY CHURCH HUNG IN BLACK SPARELY LIGHTED WITH A FEW CANDLES
GLEAMING AFAR OFF ON THE PRINCIPAL ALTAR OPENED IN THE MIDST OF THE
PLACE WHICH WAS DAZZLING WITH LIGHT LIKE THE MOUTH OF A CAVERN
AT THE
VERY EXTREMITY IN THE GLOOM OF THE APSE A GIGANTIC SILVER CROSS
WAS VISIBLE AGAINST A BLACK DRAPERY WHICH HUNG FROM THE VAULT TO THE
PAVEMENT
THE WHOLE NAVE WAS DESERTED
BUT A FEW HEADS OF PRIESTS COULD
BE SEEN MOVING CONFUSEDLY IN THE DISTANT CHOIR STALLS AND AT THE
MOMENT WHEN THE GREAT DOOR OPENED THERE ESCAPED FROM THE CHURCH A
LOUD SOLEMN AND MONOTONOUS CHANTING WHICH CAST OVER THE HEAD OF THE
CONDEMNED GIRL IN GUSTS FRAGMENTS OF MELANCHOLY PSALMS
NON TIMEBO MILLIA POPULI CIRCUMDANTIS ME EXSURGE DOMINE SALVUM ME
FAC DEUS
SALVUM ME FAC DEUS QUONIAM INTRAVERUNT AQU USQUE AD ANIMAM MEAM
INFIXUS SUM IN LIMO PROFUNDI ET NON EST SUBSTANTIA
AT THE SAME TIME ANOTHER VOICE SEPARATE FROM THE CHOIR INTONED UPON
THE STEPS OF THE CHIEF ALTAR THIS MELANCHOLY OFFERTORY QUI VERBUM
MEUM AUDIT ET CREDIT EI QUI MISIT ME HABET VITAM OETERNAM ET IN
JUDICIUM NON VENIT SED TRANSIT A MORTE IM VITAM
HE THAT HEARETH MY WORD AND BELIEVETH ON HIM THAT SENT ME
HATH ETERNAL LIFE AND HATH NOT COME INTO CONDEMNATION BUT IS PASSED
FROM DEATH TO LIFE
THIS CHANT WHICH A FEW OLD MEN BURIED IN THE GLOOM SANG FROM AFAR OVER
THAT BEAUTIFUL CREATURE FULL OF YOUTH AND LIFE CARESSED BY THE WARM
AIR OF SPRING INUNDATED WITH SUNLIGHT WAS THE MASS FOR THE DEAD
THE PEOPLE LISTENED DEVOUTLY
THE UNHAPPY GIRL SEEMED TO LOSE HER SIGHT AND HER CONSCIOUSNESS IN
THE OBSCURE INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH
HER WHITE LIPS MOVED AS THOUGH IN
PRAYER AND THE HEADSMAN'S ASSISTANT WHO APPROACHED TO ASSIST HER
TO ALIGHT FROM THE CART HEARD HER REPEATING THIS WORD IN A LOW
TONE PHOEBUS
THEY UNTIED HER HANDS MADE HER ALIGHT ACCOMPANIED BY HER GOAT WHICH
HAD ALSO BEEN UNBOUND AND WHICH BLEATED WITH JOY AT FINDING ITSELF
FREE AND THEY MADE HER WALK BAREFOOT ON THE HARD PAVEMENT TO THE FOOT
OF THE STEPS LEADING TO THE DOOR
THE ROPE ABOUT HER NECK TRAILED BEHIND
HER
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID IT WAS A SERPENT FOLLOWING HER
THEN THE CHANTING IN THE CHURCH CEASED
A GREAT GOLDEN CROSS AND A ROW
OF WAX CANDLES BEGAN TO MOVE THROUGH THE GLOOM
THE HALBERDS OF THE
MOTLEY BEADLES CLANKED AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER A LONG PROCESSION OF
PRIESTS IN CHASUBLES AND DEACONS IN DALMATICS MARCHED GRAVELY TOWARDS
THE CONDEMNED GIRL AS THEY DRAWLED THEIR SONG SPREAD OUT BEFORE HER
VIEW AND THAT OF THE CROWD
BUT HER GLANCE RESTED ON THE ONE WHO MARCHED
AT THE HEAD IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CROSS BEARER
OH SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AND WITH A SHUDDER 'TIS HE AGAIN THE
PRIEST
IT WAS IN FACT THE ARCHDEACON
ON HIS LEFT HE HAD THE SUB CHANTER ON
HIS RIGHT THE CHANTER ARMED WITH HIS OFFICIAL WAND
HE ADVANCED WITH
HEAD THROWN BACK HIS EYES FIXED AND WIDE OPEN INTONING IN A STRONG
VOICE
DE VENTRE INFERI CLAMAVI ET EXAUDISTI VOCEM MEAM
ET PROJECISTI ME IN PROFUNDUM IN CORDE MANS ET FLUMEM CIRCUMDEDIT
ME
OUT OF THE BELLY OF HELL CRIED I AND THOU HEARDEST
MY VOICE
FOR THOU HADST CAST ME INTO THE DEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE SEAS
AND THE FLOODS COMPASSED ME ABOUT
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE FULL DAYLIGHT BENEATH
THE LOFTY ARCHED PORTAL ENVELOPED IN AN AMPLE COPE OF SILVER BARRED
WITH A BLACK CROSS HE WAS SO PALE THAT MORE THAN ONE PERSON IN THE
CROWD THOUGHT THAT ONE OF THE MARBLE BISHOPS WHO KNELT ON THE SEPULCHRAL
STONES OF THE CHOIR HAD RISEN AND WAS COME TO RECEIVE UPON THE BRINK OF
THE TOMB THE WOMAN WHO WAS ABOUT TO DIE
SHE NO LESS PALE NO LESS LIKE A STATUE HAD HARDLY NOTICED THAT THEY
HAD PLACED IN HER HAND A HEAVY LIGHTED CANDLE OF YELLOW WAX SHE HAD
NOT HEARD THE YELPING VOICE OF THE CLERK READING THE FATAL CONTENTS
OF THE APOLOGY WHEN THEY TOLD HER TO RESPOND WITH AMEN SHE RESPONDED
AMEN
SHE ONLY RECOVERED LIFE AND FORCE WHEN SHE BEHELD THE PRIEST MAKE
A SIGN TO HER GUARDS TO WITHDRAW AND HIMSELF ADVANCE ALONE TOWARDS HER
THEN SHE FELT HER BLOOD BOIL IN HER HEAD AND A REMNANT OF INDIGNATION
FLASHED UP IN THAT SOUL ALREADY BENUMBED AND COLD
THE ARCHDEACON APPROACHED HER SLOWLY EVEN IN THAT EXTREMITY SHE BEHELD
HIM CAST AN EYE SPARKLING WITH SENSUALITY JEALOUSY AND DESIRE OVER
HER EXPOSED FORM
THEN HE SAID ALOUD
YOUNG GIRL HAVE YOU ASKED GOD'S PARDON FOR YOUR FAULTS AND
SHORTCOMINGS
HE BENT DOWN TO HER EAR AND ADDED THE SPECTATORS SUPPOSED THAT HE
WAS RECEIVING HER LAST CONFESSION WILL YOU HAVE ME I CAN STILL SAVE
YOU
SHE LOOKED INTENTLY AT HIM BEGONE DEMON OR I WILL DENOUNCE YOU
HE GAVE VENT TO A HORRIBLE SMILE YOU WILL NOT BE BELIEVED
YOU WILL
ONLY ADD A SCANDAL TO A CRIME
REPLY QUICKLY WILL YOU HAVE ME
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY PHOEBUS
HE IS DEAD SAID THE PRIEST
AT THAT MOMENT THE WRETCHED ARCHDEACON RAISED HIS HEAD MECHANICALLY AND
BEHELD AT THE OTHER END OF THE PLACE IN THE BALCONY OF THE GONDELAURIER
MANSION THE CAPTAIN STANDING BESIDE FLEUR DE LYS
HE STAGGERED PASSED
HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES LOOKED AGAIN MUTTERED A CURSE AND ALL HIS
FEATURES WERE VIOLENTLY CONTORTED
WELL DIE THEN HE HISSED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
NO ONE SHALL HAVE
YOU THEN RAISING HIS HAND OVER THE GYPSY HE EXCLAIMED IN A FUNEREAL
VOICE I NUNC ANIMA ANCEPS ET SIT TIBI DEUS MISENICORS
GO NOW SOUL TREMBLING IN THE BALANCE AND GOD HAVE MERCY
UPON THEE
THIS WAS THE DREAD FORMULA WITH WHICH IT WAS THE CUSTOM TO CONCLUDE
THESE GLOOMY CEREMONIES
IT WAS THE SIGNAL AGREED UPON BETWEEN THE
PRIEST AND THE EXECUTIONER
THE CROWD KNELT
KYRIE ELEISON SAID THE PRIESTS WHO HAD REMAINED BENEATH THE ARCH
OF THE PORTAL
LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US
KYRIE ELEISON REPEATED THE THRONG IN THAT MURMUR WHICH RUNS OVER
ALL HEADS LIKE THE WAVES OF A TROUBLED SEA
AMEN SAID THE ARCHDEACON
HE TURNED HIS BACK ON THE CONDEMNED GIRL HIS HEAD SANK UPON HIS BREAST
ONCE MORE HE CROSSED HIS HANDS AND REJOINED HIS ESCORT OF PRIESTS AND
A MOMENT LATER HE WAS SEEN TO DISAPPEAR WITH THE CROSS THE CANDLES
AND THE COPES BENEATH THE MISTY ARCHES OF THE CATHEDRAL AND HIS
SONOROUS VOICE WAS EXTINGUISHED BY DEGREES IN THE CHOIR AS HE CHANTED
THIS VERSE OF DESPAIR
OMNES GURGITES TUI ET FLUCTUS TUI SUPER ME TRANSIERUNT
ALL THY WAVES AND THY BILLOWS HAVE GONE OVER ME
AT THE SAME TIME THE INTERMITTENT CLASH OF THE IRON BUTTS OF THE
BEADLES' HALBERDS GRADUALLY DYING AWAY AMONG THE COLUMNS OF THE NAVE
PRODUCED THE EFFECT OF A CLOCK HAMMER STRIKING THE LAST HOUR OF THE
CONDEMNED
THE DOORS OF NOTRE DAME REMAINED OPEN ALLOWING A VIEW OF THE EMPTY
DESOLATE CHURCH DRAPED IN MOURNING WITHOUT CANDLES AND WITHOUT
VOICES
THE CONDEMNED GIRL REMAINED MOTIONLESS IN HER PLACE WAITING TO BE
DISPOSED OF
ONE OF THE SERGEANTS OF POLICE WAS OBLIGED TO NOTIFY MASTER
CHARMOLUE OF THE FACT AS THE LATTER DURING THIS ENTIRE SCENE HAD BEEN
ENGAGED IN STUDYING THE BAS RELIEF OF THE GRAND PORTAL WHICH REPRESENTS
ACCORDING TO SOME THE SACRIFICE OF ABRAHAM ACCORDING TO OTHERS THE
PHILOSOPHER'S ALCHEMICAL OPERATION THE SUN BEING FIGURED FORTH BY THE
ANGEL THE FIRE BY THE FAGOT THE ARTISAN BY ABRAHAM
THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN DRAWING HIM AWAY FROM THAT
CONTEMPLATION BUT AT LENGTH HE TURNED ROUND AND AT A SIGNAL WHICH HE
GAVE TWO MEN CLAD IN YELLOW THE EXECUTIONER'S ASSISTANTS APPROACHED
THE GYPSY TO BIND HER HANDS ONCE MORE
THE UNHAPPY CREATURE AT THE MOMENT OF MOUNTING ONCE AGAIN THE FATAL
CART AND PROCEEDING TO HER LAST HALTING PLACE WAS SEIZED POSSIBLY
WITH SOME POIGNANT CLINGING TO LIFE
SHE RAISED HER DRY RED EYES TO
HEAVEN TO THE SUN TO THE SILVERY CLOUDS CUT HERE AND THERE BY A BLUE
TRAPEZIUM OR TRIANGLE THEN SHE LOWERED THEM TO OBJECTS AROUND HER TO
THE EARTH THE THRONG THE HOUSES ALL AT ONCE WHILE THE YELLOW MAN WAS
BINDING HER ELBOWS SHE UTTERED A TERRIBLE CRY A CRY OF JOY
YONDER ON
THAT BALCONY AT THE CORNER OF THE PLACE SHE HAD JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF
HIM OF HER FRIEND HER LORD PHOEBUS THE OTHER APPARITION OF HER LIFE
THE JUDGE HAD LIED THE PRIEST HAD LIED IT WAS CERTAINLY HE SHE COULD
NOT DOUBT IT HE WAS THERE HANDSOME ALIVE DRESSED IN HIS BRILLIANT
UNIFORM HIS PLUME ON HIS HEAD HIS SWORD BY HIS SIDE
PHOEBUS SHE CRIED MY PHOEBUS
AND SHE TRIED TO STRETCH TOWARDS HIM ARMS TREMBLING WITH LOVE AND
RAPTURE BUT THEY WERE BOUND
THEN SHE SAW THE CAPTAIN FROWN A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS LEANING
AGAINST HIM GAZED AT HIM WITH DISDAINFUL LIPS AND IRRITATED EYES THEN
PHOEBUS UTTERED SOME WORDS WHICH DID NOT REACH HER AND BOTH DISAPPEARED
PRECIPITATELY BEHIND THE WINDOW OPENING UPON THE BALCONY WHICH CLOSED
AFTER THEM
PHOEBUS SHE CRIED WILDLY CAN IT BE YOU BELIEVE IT A MONSTROUS
THOUGHT HAD JUST PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER
SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD
BEEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH FOR MURDER COMMITTED ON THE PERSON OF PHOEBUS DE
CHTEAUPERS
SHE HAD BORNE UP UNTIL THAT MOMENT
BUT THIS LAST BLOW WAS TOO HARSH
SHE FELL LIFELESS ON THE PAVEMENT
COME SAID CHARMOLUE CARRY HER TO THE CART AND MAKE AN END OF IT
NO ONE HAD YET OBSERVED IN THE GALLERY OF THE STATUES OF THE KINGS
CARVED DIRECTLY ABOVE THE ARCHES OF THE PORTAL A STRANGE SPECTATOR WHO
HAD UP TO THAT TIME OBSERVED EVERYTHING WITH SUCH IMPASSIVENESS WITH
A NECK SO STRAINED A VISAGE SO HIDEOUS THAT IN HIS MOTLEY ACCOUTREMENT
OF RED AND VIOLET HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THOSE STONE
MONSTERS THROUGH WHOSE MOUTHS THE LONG GUTTERS OF THE CATHEDRAL HAVE
DISCHARGED THEIR WATERS FOR SIX HUNDRED YEARS
THIS SPECTATOR HAD MISSED
NOTHING THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE SINCE MIDDAY IN FRONT OF THE PORTAL OF
NOTRE DAME
AND AT THE VERY BEGINNING HE HAD SECURELY FASTENED TO ONE OF
THE SMALL COLUMNS A LARGE KNOTTED ROPE ONE END OF WHICH TRAILED ON THE
FLIGHT OF STEPS BELOW
THIS BEING DONE HE BEGAN TO LOOK ON TRANQUILLY
WHISTLING FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN A BLACKBIRD FLITTED PAST
SUDDENLY
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE SUPERINTENDENT'S ASSISTANTS WERE PREPARING
TO EXECUTE CHARMOLUE'S PHLEGMATIC ORDER HE THREW HIS LEG OVER THE
BALUSTRADE OF THE GALLERY SEIZED THE ROPE WITH HIS FEET HIS KNEES AND
HIS HANDS THEN HE WAS SEEN TO GLIDE DOWN THE FAADE AS A DROP OF
RAIN SLIPS DOWN A WINDOW PANE RUSH TO THE TWO EXECUTIONERS WITH THE
SWIFTNESS OF A CAT WHICH HAS FALLEN FROM A ROOF KNOCK THEM DOWN WITH
TWO ENORMOUS FISTS PICK UP THE GYPSY WITH ONE HAND AS A CHILD WOULD
HER DOLL AND DASH BACK INTO THE CHURCH WITH A SINGLE BOUND LIFTING THE
YOUNG GIRL ABOVE HIS HEAD AND CRYING IN A FORMIDABLE VOICE
SANCTUARY
THIS WAS DONE WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT HAD IT TAKEN PLACE AT NIGHT
THE WHOLE OF IT COULD HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE FLASH OF
LIGHTNING
SANCTUARY SANCTUARY REPEATED THE CROWD AND THE CLAPPING OF TEN
THOUSAND HANDS MADE QUASIMODO'S SINGLE EYE SPARKLE WITH JOY AND PRIDE
THIS SHOCK RESTORED THE CONDEMNED GIRL TO HER SENSES
SHE RAISED HER
EYELIDS LOOKED AT QUASIMODO THEN CLOSED THEM AGAIN SUDDENLY AS THOUGH
TERRIFIED BY HER DELIVERER
CHARMOLUE WAS STUPEFIED AS WELL AS THE EXECUTIONERS AND THE ENTIRE
ESCORT
IN FACT WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF NOTRE DAME THE CONDEMNED GIRL
COULD NOT BE TOUCHED
THE CATHEDRAL WAS A PLACE OF REFUGE
ALL TEMPORAL
JURISDICTION EXPIRED UPON ITS THRESHOLD
QUASIMODO HAD HALTED BENEATH THE GREAT PORTAL HIS HUGE FEET SEEMED
AS SOLID ON THE PAVEMENT OF THE CHURCH AS THE HEAVY ROMAN PILLARS
HIS GREAT BUSHY HEAD SAT LOW BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS LIKE THE HEADS OF
LIONS WHO ALSO HAVE A MANE AND NO NECK
HE HELD THE YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS
QUIVERING ALL OVER SUSPENDED FROM HIS HORNY HANDS LIKE A WHITE DRAPERY
BUT HE CARRIED HER WITH AS MUCH CARE AS THOUGH HE FEARED TO BREAK HER
OR BLIGHT HER
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE FELT THAT SHE WAS A DELICATE
EXQUISITE PRECIOUS THING MADE FOR OTHER HANDS THAN HIS
THERE WERE
MOMENTS WHEN HE LOOKED AS IF NOT DARING TO TOUCH HER EVEN WITH HIS
BREATH
THEN ALL AT ONCE HE WOULD PRESS HER FORCIBLY IN HIS ARMS
AGAINST HIS ANGULAR BOSOM LIKE HIS OWN POSSESSION HIS TREASURE AS
THE MOTHER OF THAT CHILD WOULD HAVE DONE
HIS GNOME'S EYE FASTENED UPON
HER INUNDATED HER WITH TENDERNESS SADNESS AND PITY AND WAS SUDDENLY
RAISED FILLED WITH LIGHTNINGS
THEN THE WOMEN LAUGHED AND WEPT THE
CROWD STAMPED WITH ENTHUSIASM FOR AT THAT MOMENT QUASIMODO HAD A
BEAUTY OF HIS OWN
HE WAS HANDSOME HE THAT ORPHAN THAT FOUNDLING
THAT OUTCAST HE FELT HIMSELF AUGUST AND STRONG HE GAZED IN THE FACE
OF THAT SOCIETY FROM WHICH HE WAS BANISHED AND IN WHICH HE HAD SO
POWERFULLY INTERVENED OF THAT HUMAN JUSTICE FROM WHICH HE HAD WRENCHED
ITS PREY OF ALL THOSE TIGERS WHOSE JAWS WERE FORCED TO REMAIN EMPTY OF
THOSE POLICEMEN THOSE JUDGES THOSE EXECUTIONERS OF ALL THAT FORCE OF
THE KING WHICH HE THE MEANEST OF CREATURES HAD JUST BROKEN WITH THE
FORCE OF GOD
AND THEN IT WAS TOUCHING TO BEHOLD THIS PROTECTION WHICH HAD FALLEN
FROM A BEING SO HIDEOUS UPON A BEING SO UNHAPPY A CREATURE CONDEMNED TO
DEATH SAVED BY QUASIMODO
THEY WERE TWO EXTREMES OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL
WRETCHEDNESS COMING INTO CONTACT AND AIDING EACH OTHER
MEANWHILE AFTER SEVERAL MOMENTS OF TRIUMPH QUASIMODO HAD PLUNGED
ABRUPTLY INTO THE CHURCH WITH HIS BURDEN
THE POPULACE FOND OF ALL
PROWESS SOUGHT HIM WITH THEIR EYES BENEATH THE GLOOMY NAVE REGRETTING
THAT HE HAD SO SPEEDILY DISAPPEARED FROM THEIR ACCLAMATIONS
ALL AT
ONCE HE WAS SEEN TO RE APPEAR AT ONE OF THE EXTREMITIES OF THE GALLERY
OF THE KINGS OF FRANCE HE TRAVERSED IT RUNNING LIKE A MADMAN RAISING
HIS CONQUEST HIGH IN HIS ARMS AND SHOUTING SANCTUARY THE CROWD BROKE
FORTH INTO FRESH APPLAUSE
THE GALLERY PASSED HE PLUNGED ONCE MORE
INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH
A MOMENT LATER HE RE APPEARED UPON THE
UPPER PLATFORM WITH THE GYPSY STILL IN HIS ARMS STILL RUNNING MADLY
STILL CRYING SANCTUARY AND THE THRONG APPLAUDED
FINALLY HE MADE
HIS APPEARANCE FOR THE THIRD TIME UPON THE SUMMIT OF THE TOWER WHERE
HUNG THE GREAT BELL FROM THAT POINT HE SEEMED TO BE SHOWING TO THE
ENTIRE CITY THE GIRL WHOM HE HAD SAVED AND HIS VOICE OF THUNDER THAT
VOICE WHICH WAS SO RARELY HEARD AND WHICH HE NEVER HEARD HIMSELF
REPEATED THRICE WITH FRENZY EVEN TO THE CLOUDS SANCTUARY SANCTUARY
SANCTUARY
NOEL NOEL SHOUTED THE POPULACE IN ITS TURN AND THAT IMMENSE
ACCLAMATION FLEW TO ASTONISH THE CROWD ASSEMBLED AT THE GRVE ON THE
OTHER BANK AND THE RECLUSE WHO WAS STILL WAITING WITH HER EYES RIVETED
ON THE GIBBET
BOOK NINTH
CHAPTER I
DELIRIUM
CLAUDE FROLLO WAS NO LONGER IN NOTRE DAME WHEN HIS ADOPTED SON SO
ABRUPTLY CUT THE FATAL WEB IN WHICH THE ARCHDEACON AND THE GYPSY WERE
ENTANGLED
ON RETURNING TO THE SACRISTY HE HAD TORN OFF HIS ALB COPE
AND STOLE HAD FLUNG ALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE STUPEFIED BEADLE HAD
MADE HIS ESCAPE THROUGH THE PRIVATE DOOR OF THE CLOISTER HAD ORDERED A
BOATMAN OF THE TERRAIN TO TRANSPORT HIM TO THE LEFT BANK OF THE SEINE
AND HAD PLUNGED INTO THE HILLY STREETS OF THE UNIVERSITY NOT KNOWING
WHITHER HE WAS GOING ENCOUNTERING AT EVERY STEP GROUPS OF MEN AND WOMEN
WHO WERE HURRYING JOYOUSLY TOWARDS THE PONT SAINT MICHEL IN THE HOPE
OF STILL ARRIVING IN TIME TO SEE THE WITCH HUNG THERE PALE WILD MORE
TROUBLED MORE BLIND AND MORE FIERCE THAN A NIGHT BIRD LET LOOSE AND
PURSUED BY A TROOP OF CHILDREN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
HE NO LONGER KNEW
WHERE HE WAS WHAT HE THOUGHT OR WHETHER HE WERE DREAMING
HE WENT
FORWARD WALKING RUNNING TAKING ANY STREET AT HAPHAZARD MAKING NO
CHOICE ONLY URGED EVER ONWARD AWAY FROM THE GRVE THE HORRIBLE GRVE
WHICH HE FELT CONFUSEDLY TO BE BEHIND HIM
IN THIS MANNER HE SKIRTED MOUNT SAINTE GENEVIVE AND FINALLY EMERGED
FROM THE TOWN BY THE PORTE SAINT VICTOR
HE CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT AS LONG
AS HE COULD SEE WHEN HE TURNED ROUND THE TURRETED ENCLOSURE OF THE
UNIVERSITY AND THE RARE HOUSES OF THE SUBURB BUT WHEN AT LENGTH A
RISE OF GROUND HAD COMPLETELY CONCEALED FROM HIM THAT ODIOUS PARIS WHEN
HE COULD BELIEVE HIMSELF TO BE A HUNDRED LEAGUES DISTANT FROM IT IN THE
FIELDS IN THE DESERT HE HALTED AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE BREATHED
MORE FREELY
THEN FRIGHTFUL IDEAS THRONGED HIS MIND
ONCE MORE HE COULD SEE CLEARLY
INTO HIS SOUL AND HE SHUDDERED
HE THOUGHT OF THAT UNHAPPY GIRL WHO HAD
DESTROYED HIM AND WHOM HE HAD DESTROYED
HE CAST A HAGGARD EYE OVER THE
DOUBLE TORTUOUS WAY WHICH FATE HAD CAUSED THEIR TWO DESTINIES TO PURSUE
UP TO THEIR POINT OF INTERSECTION WHERE IT HAD DASHED THEM AGAINST EACH
OTHER WITHOUT MERCY
HE MEDITATED ON THE FOLLY OF ETERNAL VOWS ON
THE VANITY OF CHASTITY OF SCIENCE OF RELIGION OF VIRTUE ON THE
USELESSNESS OF GOD
HE PLUNGED TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT IN EVIL THOUGHTS
AND IN PROPORTION AS HE SANK DEEPER HE FELT A SATANIC LAUGH BURST FORTH
WITHIN HIM
AND AS HE THUS SIFTED HIS SOUL TO THE BOTTOM WHEN HE PERCEIVED HOW
LARGE A SPACE NATURE HAD PREPARED THERE FOR THE PASSIONS HE SNEERED
STILL MORE BITTERLY
HE STIRRED UP IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS HEART ALL HIS
HATRED ALL HIS MALEVOLENCE AND WITH THE COLD GLANCE OF A PHYSICIAN
WHO EXAMINES A PATIENT HE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT THIS MALEVOLENCE
WAS NOTHING BUT VITIATED LOVE THAT LOVE THAT SOURCE OF EVERY VIRTUE IN
MAN TURNED TO HORRIBLE THINGS IN THE HEART OF A PRIEST AND THAT A MAN
CONSTITUTED LIKE HIMSELF IN MAKING HIMSELF A PRIEST MADE HIMSELF A
DEMON
THEN HE LAUGHED FRIGHTFULLY AND SUDDENLY BECAME PALE AGAIN
WHEN HE CONSIDERED THE MOST SINISTER SIDE OF HIS FATAL PASSION OF THAT
CORROSIVE VENOMOUS MALIGNANT IMPLACABLE LOVE WHICH HAD ENDED ONLY IN
THE GIBBET FOR ONE OF THEM AND IN HELL FOR THE OTHER CONDEMNATION FOR
HER DAMNATION FOR HIM
AND THEN HIS LAUGHTER CAME AGAIN WHEN HE REFLECTED THAT PHOEBUS
WAS ALIVE THAT AFTER ALL THE CAPTAIN LIVED WAS GAY AND HAPPY HAD
HANDSOMER DOUBLETS THAN EVER AND A NEW MISTRESS WHOM HE WAS CONDUCTING
TO SEE THE OLD ONE HANGED
HIS SNEER REDOUBLED ITS BITTERNESS WHEN HE
REFLECTED THAT OUT OF THE LIVING BEINGS WHOSE DEATH HE HAD DESIRED THE
GYPSY THE ONLY CREATURE WHOM HE DID NOT HATE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD
NOT ESCAPED HIM
THEN FROM THE CAPTAIN HIS THOUGHT PASSED TO THE PEOPLE AND THERE CAME
TO HIM A JEALOUSY OF AN UNPRECEDENTED SORT
HE REFLECTED THAT THE PEOPLE
ALSO THE ENTIRE POPULACE HAD HAD BEFORE THEIR EYES THE WOMAN WHOM HE
LOVED EXPOSED ALMOST NAKED
HE WRITHED HIS ARMS WITH AGONY AS HE THOUGHT
THAT THE WOMAN WHOSE FORM CAUGHT BY HIM ALONE IN THE DARKNESS WOULD
HAVE BEEN SUPREME HAPPINESS HAD BEEN DELIVERED UP IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AT
FULL NOONDAY TO A WHOLE PEOPLE CLAD AS FOR A NIGHT OF VOLUPTUOUSNESS
HE WEPT WITH RAGE OVER ALL THESE MYSTERIES OF LOVE PROFANED SOILED
LAID BARE WITHERED FOREVER
HE WEPT WITH RAGE AS HE PICTURED TO HIMSELF
HOW MANY IMPURE LOOKS HAD BEEN GRATIFIED AT THE SIGHT OF THAT BADLY
FASTENED SHIFT AND THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL THIS VIRGIN LILY THIS CUP
OF MODESTY AND DELIGHT TO WHICH HE WOULD HAVE DARED TO PLACE HIS LIPS
ONLY TREMBLING HAD JUST BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A SORT OF PUBLIC BOWL
WHEREAT THE VILEST POPULACE OF PARIS THIEVES BEGGARS LACKEYS HAD
COME TO QUAFF IN COMMON AN AUDACIOUS IMPURE AND DEPRAVED PLEASURE
AND WHEN HE SOUGHT TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF THE HAPPINESS WHICH HE MIGHT
HAVE FOUND UPON EARTH IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN A GYPSY AND IF HE HAD NOT
BEEN A PRIEST IF PHOEBUS HAD NOT EXISTED AND IF SHE HAD LOVED HIM WHEN
HE PICTURED TO HIMSELF THAT A LIFE OF SERENITY AND LOVE WOULD HAVE BEEN
POSSIBLE TO HIM ALSO EVEN TO HIM THAT THERE WERE AT THAT VERY MOMENT
HERE AND THERE UPON THE EARTH HAPPY COUPLES SPENDING THE HOURS IN SWEET
CONVERSE BENEATH ORANGE TREES ON THE BANKS OF BROOKS IN THE PRESENCE
OF A SETTING SUN OF A STARRY NIGHT AND THAT IF GOD HAD SO WILLED
HE MIGHT HAVE FORMED WITH HER ONE OF THOSE BLESSED COUPLES HIS HEART
MELTED IN TENDERNESS AND DESPAIR
OH SHE STILL SHE IT WAS THIS FIXED IDEA WHICH RETURNED INCESSANTLY
WHICH TORTURED HIM WHICH ATE INTO HIS BRAIN AND RENT HIS VITALS
HE
DID NOT REGRET HE DID NOT REPENT ALL THAT HE HAD DONE HE WAS READY
TO DO AGAIN HE PREFERRED TO BEHOLD HER IN THE HANDS OF THE EXECUTIONER
RATHER THAN IN THE ARMS OF THE CAPTAIN
BUT HE SUFFERED HE SUFFERED
SO THAT AT INTERVALS HE TORE OUT HANDFULS OF HIS HAIR TO SEE WHETHER IT
WERE NOT TURNING WHITE
AMONG OTHER MOMENTS THERE CAME ONE WHEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT WAS
PERHAPS THE VERY MINUTE WHEN THE HIDEOUS CHAIN WHICH HE HAD SEEN
THAT MORNING WAS PRESSING ITS IRON NOOSE CLOSER ABOUT THAT FRAIL AND
GRACEFUL NECK
THIS THOUGHT CAUSED THE PERSPIRATION TO START FROM EVERY
PORE
THERE WAS ANOTHER MOMENT WHEN WHILE LAUGHING DIABOLICALLY AT HIMSELF
HE REPRESENTED TO HIMSELF LA ESMERALDA AS HE HAD SEEN HER ON THAT
FIRST DAY LIVELY CARELESS JOYOUS GAYLY ATTIRED DANCING WINGED
HARMONIOUS AND LA ESMERALDA OF THE LAST DAY IN HER SCANTY SHIFT WITH
A ROPE ABOUT HER NECK MOUNTING SLOWLY WITH HER BARE FEET THE ANGULAR
LADDER OF THE GALLOWS HE FIGURED TO HIMSELF THIS DOUBLE PICTURE IN SUCH
A MANNER THAT HE GAVE VENT TO A TERRIBLE CRY
WHILE THIS HURRICANE OF DESPAIR OVERTURNED BROKE TORE UP BENT
UPROOTED EVERYTHING IN HIS SOUL HE GAZED AT NATURE AROUND HIM
AT HIS
FEET SOME CHICKENS WERE SEARCHING THE THICKETS AND PECKING ENAMELLED
BEETLES RAN ABOUT IN THE SUN OVERHEAD SOME GROUPS OF DAPPLED GRAY
CLOUDS WERE FLOATING ACROSS THE BLUE SKY ON THE HORIZON THE SPIRE
OF THE ABBEY SAINT VICTOR PIERCED THE RIDGE OF THE HILL WITH ITS SLATE
OBELISK AND THE MILLER OF THE COPEAUE HILLOCK WAS WHISTLING AS HE
WATCHED THE LABORIOUS WINGS OF HIS MILL TURNING
ALL THIS ACTIVE
ORGANIZED TRANQUIL LIFE RECURRING AROUND HIM UNDER A THOUSAND FORMS
HURT HIM
HE RESUMED HIS FLIGHT
HE SPED THUS ACROSS THE FIELDS UNTIL EVENING
THIS FLIGHT FROM NATURE
LIFE HIMSELF MAN GOD EVERYTHING LASTED ALL DAY LONG
SOMETIMES HE
FLUNG HIMSELF FACE DOWNWARD ON THE EARTH AND TORE UP THE YOUNG BLADES
OF WHEAT WITH HIS NAILS
SOMETIMES HE HALTED IN THE DESERTED STREET OF
A VILLAGE AND HIS THOUGHTS WERE SO INTOLERABLE THAT HE GRASPED HIS HEAD
IN BOTH HANDS AND TRIED TO TEAR IT FROM HIS SHOULDERS IN ORDER TO DASH
IT UPON THE PAVEMENT
TOWARDS THE HOUR OF SUNSET HE EXAMINED HIMSELF AGAIN AND FOUND HIMSELF
NEARLY MAD
THE TEMPEST WHICH HAD RAGED WITHIN HIM EVER SINCE THE
INSTANT WHEN HE HAD LOST THE HOPE AND THE WILL TO SAVE THE GYPSY THAT
TEMPEST HAD NOT LEFT IN HIS CONSCIENCE A SINGLE HEALTHY IDEA A SINGLE
THOUGHT WHICH MAINTAINED ITS UPRIGHT POSITION
HIS REASON LAY THERE
ALMOST ENTIRELY DESTROYED
THERE REMAINED BUT TWO DISTINCT IMAGES IN HIS
MIND LA ESMERALDA AND THE GALLOWS ALL THE REST WAS BLANK
THOSE TWO
IMAGES UNITED PRESENTED TO HIM A FRIGHTFUL GROUP AND THE MORE HE
CONCENTRATED WHAT ATTENTION AND THOUGHT WAS LEFT TO HIM THE MORE HE
BEHELD THEM GROW IN ACCORDANCE WITH A FANTASTIC PROGRESSION THE ONE IN
GRACE IN CHARM IN BEAUTY IN LIGHT THE OTHER IN DEFORMITY AND HORROR
SO THAT AT LAST LA ESMERALDA APPEARED TO HIM LIKE A STAR THE GIBBET
LIKE AN ENORMOUS FLESHLESS ARM
ONE REMARKABLE FACT IS THAT DURING THE WHOLE OF THIS TORTURE THE IDEA
OF DYING DID NOT SERIOUSLY OCCUR TO HIM
THE WRETCH WAS MADE SO
HE
CLUNG TO LIFE
PERHAPS HE REALLY SAW HELL BEYOND IT
MEANWHILE THE DAY CONTINUED TO DECLINE
THE LIVING BEING WHICH STILL
EXISTED IN HIM REFLECTED VAGUELY ON RETRACING ITS STEPS
HE BELIEVED
HIMSELF TO BE FAR AWAY FROM PARIS ON TAKING HIS BEARINGS HE PERCEIVED
THAT HE HAD ONLY CIRCLED THE ENCLOSURE OF THE UNIVERSITY
THE SPIRE OF
SAINT SULPICE AND THE THREE LOFTY NEEDLES OF SAINT GERMAIN DES PRS
ROSE ABOVE THE HORIZON ON HIS RIGHT
HE TURNED HIS STEPS IN THAT
DIRECTION
WHEN HE HEARD THE BRISK CHALLENGE OF THE MEN AT ARMS OF THE
ABBEY AROUND THE CRENELATED CIRCUMSCRIBING WALL OF SAINT GERMAIN HE
TURNED ASIDE TOOK A PATH WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF BETWEEN THE ABBEY AND
THE LAZAR HOUSE OF THE BOURG AND AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES
FOUND HIMSELF ON THE VERGE OF THE PR AUX CLERCS
THIS MEADOW WAS
CELEBRATED BY REASON OF THE BRAWLS WHICH WENT ON THERE NIGHT AND DAY
IT WAS THE HYDRA OF THE POOR MONKS OF SAINT GERMAIN QUOD MOUACHIS
SANCTI GERMAINI PRATENSIS HYDRA FUIT CLERICIS NOVA SEMPER DISSIDIORUM
CAPITA SUSCITANTIBUS
THE ARCHDEACON WAS AFRAID OF MEETING SOME ONE
THERE HE FEARED EVERY HUMAN COUNTENANCE HE HAD JUST AVOIDED THE
UNIVERSITY AND THE BOURG SAINT GERMAIN HE WISHED TO RE ENTER THE
STREETS AS LATE AS POSSIBLE
HE SKIRTED THE PR AUX CLERCS TOOK THE
DESERTED PATH WHICH SEPARATED IT FROM THE DIEU NEUF AND AT LAST REACHED
THE WATER'S EDGE
THERE DOM CLAUDE FOUND A BOATMAN WHO FOR A FEW
FARTHINGS IN PARISIAN COINAGE ROWED HIM UP THE SEINE AS FAR AS THE
POINT OF THE CITY AND LANDED HIM ON THAT TONGUE OF ABANDONED LAND
WHERE THE READER HAS ALREADY BEHELD GRINGOIRE DREAMING AND WHICH
WAS PROLONGED BEYOND THE KING'S GARDENS PARALLEL TO THE ILE DU
PASSEUR AUX VACHES
THE MONOTONOUS ROCKING OF THE BOAT AND THE RIPPLE OF THE WATER HAD IN
SOME SORT QUIETED THE UNHAPPY CLAUDE
WHEN THE BOATMAN HAD TAKEN HIS
DEPARTURE HE REMAINED STANDING STUPIDLY ON THE STRAND STARING STRAIGHT
BEFORE HIM AND PERCEIVING OBJECTS ONLY THROUGH MAGNIFYING OSCILLATIONS
WHICH RENDERED EVERYTHING A SORT OF PHANTASMAGORIA TO HIM
THE FATIGUE
OF A GREAT GRIEF NOT INFREQUENTLY PRODUCES THIS EFFECT ON THE MIND
THE SUN HAD SET BEHIND THE LOFTY TOUR DE NESLE
IT WAS THE TWILIGHT
HOUR
THE SKY WAS WHITE THE WATER OF THE RIVER WAS WHITE
BETWEEN THESE
TWO WHITE EXPANSES THE LEFT BANK OF THE SEINE ON WHICH HIS EYES WERE
FIXED PROJECTED ITS GLOOMY MASS AND RENDERED EVER THINNER AND THINNER
BY PERSPECTIVE IT PLUNGED INTO THE GLOOM OF THE HORIZON LIKE A BLACK
SPIRE
IT WAS LOADED WITH HOUSES OF WHICH ONLY THE OBSCURE OUTLINE
COULD BE DISTINGUISHED SHARPLY BROUGHT OUT IN SHADOWS AGAINST THE LIGHT
BACKGROUND OF THE SKY AND THE WATER
HERE AND THERE WINDOWS BEGAN TO
GLEAM LIKE THE HOLES IN A BRAZIER
THAT IMMENSE BLACK OBELISK THUS
ISOLATED BETWEEN THE TWO WHITE EXPANSES OF THE SKY AND THE RIVER
WHICH WAS VERY BROAD AT THIS POINT PRODUCED UPON DOM CLAUDE A SINGULAR
EFFECT COMPARABLE TO THAT WHICH WOULD BE EXPERIENCED BY A MAN WHO
RECLINING ON HIS BACK AT THE FOOT OF THE TOWER OF STRASBURG SHOULD GAZE
AT THE ENORMOUS SPIRE PLUNGING INTO THE SHADOWS OF THE TWILIGHT ABOVE
HIS HEAD
ONLY IN THIS CASE IT WAS CLAUDE WHO WAS ERECT AND THE
OBELISK WHICH WAS LYING DOWN BUT AS THE RIVER REFLECTING THE SKY
PROLONGED THE ABYSS BELOW HIM THE IMMENSE PROMONTORY SEEMED TO BE AS
BOLDLY LAUNCHED INTO SPACE AS ANY CATHEDRAL SPIRE AND THE IMPRESSION
WAS THE SAME
THIS IMPRESSION HAD EVEN ONE STRONGER AND MORE PROFOUND
POINT ABOUT IT THAT IT WAS INDEED THE TOWER OF STRASBOURG BUT THE
TOWER OF STRASBOURG TWO LEAGUES IN HEIGHT SOMETHING UNHEARD OF
GIGANTIC IMMEASURABLE AN EDIFICE SUCH AS NO HUMAN EYE HAS EVER SEEN
A TOWER OF BABEL
THE CHIMNEYS OF THE HOUSES THE BATTLEMENTS OF THE
WALLS THE FACETED GABLES OF THE ROOFS THE SPIRE OF THE AUGUSTINES
THE TOWER OF NESLE ALL THESE PROJECTIONS WHICH BROKE THE PROFILE OF
THE COLOSSAL OBELISK ADDED TO THE ILLUSION BY DISPLAYING IN ECCENTRIC
FASHION TO THE EYE THE INDENTATIONS OF A LUXURIANT AND FANTASTIC
SCULPTURE
CLAUDE IN THE STATE OF HALLUCINATION IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF
BELIEVED THAT HE SAW THAT HE SAW WITH HIS ACTUAL EYES THE BELL TOWER
OF HELL THE THOUSAND LIGHTS SCATTERED OVER THE WHOLE HEIGHT OF THE
TERRIBLE TOWER SEEMED TO HIM SO MANY PORCHES OF THE IMMENSE INTERIOR
FURNACE THE VOICES AND NOISES WHICH ESCAPED FROM IT SEEMED SO MANY
SHRIEKS SO MANY DEATH GROANS
THEN HE BECAME ALARMED HE PUT HIS HANDS
ON HIS EARS THAT HE MIGHT NO LONGER HEAR TURNED HIS BACK THAT HE MIGHT
NO LONGER SEE AND FLED FROM THE FRIGHTFUL VISION WITH HASTY STRIDES
BUT THE VISION WAS IN HIMSELF
WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE STREETS THE PASSERS BY ELBOWING EACH OTHER BY
THE LIGHT OF THE SHOP FRONTS PRODUCED UPON HIM THE EFFECT OF A CONSTANT
GOING AND COMING OF SPECTRES ABOUT HIM
THERE WERE STRANGE NOISES IN HIS
EARS EXTRAORDINARY FANCIES DISTURBED HIS BRAIN
HE SAW NEITHER
HOUSES NOR PAVEMENTS NOR CHARIOTS NOR MEN AND WOMEN BUT A CHAOS OF
INDETERMINATE OBJECTS WHOSE EDGES MELTED INTO EACH OTHER
AT THE CORNER
OF THE RUE DE LA BARILLERIE THERE WAS A GROCER'S SHOP WHOSE PORCH WAS
GARNISHED ALL ABOUT ACCORDING TO IMMEMORIAL CUSTOM WITH HOOPS OF TIN
FROM WHICH HUNG A CIRCLE OF WOODEN CANDLES WHICH CAME IN CONTACT WITH
EACH OTHER IN THE WIND AND RATTLED LIKE CASTANETS
HE THOUGHT HE HEARD
A CLUSTER OF SKELETONS AT MONTFAUON CLASHING TOGETHER IN THE GLOOM
OH HE MUTTERED THE NIGHT BREEZE DASHES THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER
AND MINGLES THE NOISE OF THEIR CHAINS WITH THE RATTLE OF THEIR BONES
PERHAPS SHE IS THERE AMONG THEM
IN HIS STATE OF FRENZY HE KNEW NOT WHITHER HE WAS GOING
AFTER A FEW
STRIDES HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE PONT SAINT MICHEL
THERE WAS A LIGHT
IN THE WINDOW OF A GROUND FLOOR ROOM HE APPROACHED
THROUGH A CRACKED
WINDOW HE BEHELD A MEAN CHAMBER WHICH RECALLED SOME CONFUSED MEMORY
TO HIS MIND
IN THAT ROOM BADLY LIGHTED BY A MEAGRE LAMP THERE WAS A
FRESH LIGHT HAIRED YOUNG MAN WITH A MERRY FACE WHO AMID LOUD BURSTS
OF LAUGHTER WAS EMBRACING A VERY AUDACIOUSLY ATTIRED YOUNG GIRL AND
NEAR THE LAMP SAT AN OLD CRONE SPINNING AND SINGING IN A QUAVERING
VOICE
AS THE YOUNG MAN DID NOT LAUGH CONSTANTLY FRAGMENTS OF THE OLD
WOMAN'S DITTY REACHED THE PRIEST IT WAS SOMETHING UNINTELLIGIBLE YET
FRIGHTFUL

THE CRONE WAS
LA FALOURDEL THE GIRL WAS A COURTESAN THE YOUNG MAN WAS HIS BROTHER
JEHAN
HE CONTINUED TO GAZE
THAT SPECTACLE WAS AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER
HE SAW JEHAN GO TO A WINDOW AT THE END OF THE ROOM OPEN IT CAST A
GLANCE ON THE QUAY WHERE IN THE DISTANCE BLAZED A THOUSAND LIGHTED
CASEMENTS AND HE HEARD HIM SAY AS HE CLOSED THE SASH
'PON MY SOUL HOW DARK IT IS THE PEOPLE ARE LIGHTING THEIR CANDLES
AND THE GOOD GOD HIS STARS
THEN JEHAN CAME BACK TO THE HAG SMASHED A BOTTLE STANDING ON THE TABLE
EXCLAIMING
ALREADY EMPTY COR BOEUF AND I HAVE NO MORE MONEY ISABEAU MY DEAR
I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH JUPITER UNTIL HE HAS CHANGED YOUR TWO
WHITE NIPPLES INTO TWO BLACK BOTTLES WHERE I MAY SUCK WINE OF BEAUNE
DAY AND NIGHT
THIS FINE PLEASANTRY MADE THE COURTESAN LAUGH AND JEHAN LEFT THE ROOM
DOM CLAUDE HAD BARELY TIME TO FLING HIMSELF ON THE GROUND IN ORDER THAT
HE MIGHT NOT BE MET STARED IN THE FACE AND RECOGNIZED BY HIS BROTHER
LUCKILY THE STREET WAS DARK AND THE SCHOLAR WAS TIPSY
NEVERTHELESS
HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE ARCHDEACON PRONE UPON THE EARTH IN THE MUD
OH OH SAID HE HERE'S A FELLOW WHO HAS BEEN LEADING A JOLLY LIFE
TO DAY
HE STIRRED UP DOM CLAUDE WITH HIS FOOT AND THE LATTER HELD HIS BREATH
DEAD DRUNK RESUMED JEHAN
COME HE'S FULL
A REGULAR LEECH DETACHED
FROM A HOGSHEAD
HE'S BALD HE ADDED BENDING DOWN 'TIS AN OLD MAN
FORTUNATE SENEX
THEN DOM CLAUDE HEARD HIM RETREAT SAYING
'TIS ALL THE SAME REASON IS A FINE THING AND MY BROTHER THE
ARCHDEACON IS VERY HAPPY IN THAT HE IS WISE AND HAS MONEY
THEN THE ARCHDEACON ROSE TO HIS FEET AND RAN WITHOUT HALTING TOWARDS
NOTRE DAME WHOSE ENORMOUS TOWERS HE BEHELD RISING ABOVE THE HOUSES
THROUGH THE GLOOM
AT THE INSTANT WHEN HE ARRIVED PANTING ON THE PLACE DU PARVIS HE
SHRANK BACK AND DARED NOT RAISE HIS EYES TO THE FATAL EDIFICE
OH HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT SUCH A THING TOOK
PLACE HERE TO DAY THIS VERY MORNING
STILL HE VENTURED TO GLANCE AT THE CHURCH
THE FRONT WAS SOMBRE THE
SKY BEHIND WAS GLITTERING WITH STARS
THE CRESCENT OF THE MOON IN HER
FLIGHT UPWARD FROM THE HORIZON HAD PAUSED AT THE MOMENT ON THE SUMMIT
OF THE LIGHT HAND TOWER AND SEEMED TO HAVE PERCHED ITSELF LIKE A
LUMINOUS BIRD ON THE EDGE OF THE BALUSTRADE CUT OUT IN BLACK TREFOILS
THE CLOISTER DOOR WAS SHUT BUT THE ARCHDEACON ALWAYS CARRIED WITH HIM
THE KEY OF THE TOWER IN WHICH HIS LABORATORY WAS SITUATED
HE MADE USE
OF IT TO ENTER THE CHURCH
IN THE CHURCH HE FOUND THE GLOOM AND SILENCE OF A CAVERN
BY THE DEEP
SHADOWS WHICH FELL IN BROAD SHEETS FROM ALL DIRECTIONS HE RECOGNIZED
THE FACT THAT THE HANGINGS FOR THE CEREMONY OF THE MORNING HAD NOT YET
BEEN REMOVED
THE GREAT SILVER CROSS SHONE FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE
GLOOM POWDERED WITH SOME SPARKLING POINTS LIKE THE MILKY WAY OF
THAT SEPULCHRAL NIGHT
THE LONG WINDOWS OF THE CHOIR SHOWED THE UPPER
EXTREMITIES OF THEIR ARCHES ABOVE THE BLACK DRAPERIES AND THEIR PAINTED
PANES TRAVERSED BY A RAY OF MOONLIGHT HAD NO LONGER ANY HUES BUT THE
DOUBTFUL COLORS OF NIGHT A SORT OF VIOLET WHITE AND BLUE WHOSE TINT
IS FOUND ONLY ON THE FACES OF THE DEAD
THE ARCHDEACON ON PERCEIVING
THESE WAN SPOTS ALL AROUND THE CHOIR THOUGHT HE BEHELD THE MITRES OF
DAMNED BISHOPS
HE SHUT HIS EYES AND WHEN HE OPENED THEM AGAIN HE
THOUGHT THEY WERE A CIRCLE OF PALE VISAGES GAZING AT HIM
HE STARTED TO FLEE ACROSS THE CHURCH
THEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE
CHURCH ALSO WAS SHAKING MOVING BECOMING ENDUED WITH ANIMATION THAT IT
WAS ALIVE THAT EACH OF THE GREAT COLUMNS WAS TURNING INTO AN ENORMOUS
PAW WHICH WAS BEATING THE EARTH WITH ITS BIG STONE SPATULA AND THAT
THE GIGANTIC CATHEDRAL WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT A SORT OF PRODIGIOUS
ELEPHANT WHICH WAS BREATHING AND MARCHING WITH ITS PILLARS FOR FEET
ITS TWO TOWERS FOR TRUNKS AND THE IMMENSE BLACK CLOTH FOR ITS HOUSINGS
THIS FEVER OR MADNESS HAD REACHED SUCH A DEGREE OF INTENSITY THAT THE
EXTERNAL WORLD WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE FOR THE UNHAPPY MAN THAN A
SORT OF APOCALYPSE VISIBLE PALPABLE TERRIBLE
FOR ONE MOMENT HE WAS RELIEVED
AS HE PLUNGED INTO THE SIDE AISLES HE
PERCEIVED A REDDISH LIGHT BEHIND A CLUSTER OF PILLARS
HE RAN TOWARDS IT
AS TO A STAR
IT WAS THE POOR LAMP WHICH LIGHTED THE PUBLIC BREVIARY
OF NOTRE DAME NIGHT AND DAY BENEATH ITS IRON GRATING
HE FLUNG HIMSELF
EAGERLY UPON THE HOLY BOOK IN THE HOPE OF FINDING SOME CONSOLATION OR
SOME ENCOURAGEMENT THERE
THE HOOK LAY OPEN AT THIS PASSAGE OF JOB OVER
WHICH HIS STARING EYE GLANCED
AND A SPIRIT PASSED BEFORE MY FACE AND I HEARD A SMALL VOICE AND THE
HAIR OF MY FLESH STOOD UP
ON READING THESE GLOOMY WORDS HE FELT THAT WHICH A BLIND MAN FEELS WHEN
HE FEELS HIMSELF PRICKED BY THE STAFF WHICH HE HAS PICKED UP
HIS KNEES
GAVE WAY BENEATH HIM AND HE SANK UPON THE PAVEMENT THINKING OF HER WHO
HAD DIED THAT DAY
HE FELT SO MANY MONSTROUS VAPORS PASS AND DISCHARGE
THEMSELVES IN HIS BRAIN THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HIS HEAD HAD BECOME
ONE OF THE CHIMNEYS OF HELL
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT HE REMAINED A LONG TIME IN THIS ATTITUDE NO LONGER
THINKING OVERWHELMED AND PASSIVE BENEATH THE HAND OF THE DEMON
AT
LENGTH SOME STRENGTH RETURNED TO HIM IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO TAKE REFUGE
IN HIS TOWER BESIDE HIS FAITHFUL QUASIMODO
HE ROSE AND AS HE WAS
AFRAID HE TOOK THE LAMP FROM THE BREVIARY TO LIGHT HIS WAY
IT WAS A
SACRILEGE BUT HE HAD GOT BEYOND HEEDING SUCH A TRIFLE NOW
HE SLOWLY CLIMBED THE STAIRS OF THE TOWERS FILLED WITH A SECRET FRIGHT
WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE RARE PASSERS BY IN THE PLACE
DU PARVIS BY THE MYSTERIOUS LIGHT OF HIS LAMP MOUNTING SO LATE FROM
LOOPHOLE TO LOOPHOLE OF THE BELL TOWER
ALL AT ONCE HE FELT A FRESHNESS ON HIS FACE AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE
DOOR OF THE HIGHEST GALLERY
THE AIR WAS COLD THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH
HURRYING CLOUDS WHOSE LARGE WHITE FLAKES DRIFTED ONE UPON ANOTHER LIKE
THE BREAKING UP OF RIVER ICE AFTER THE WINTER
THE CRESCENT OF THE MOON
STRANDED IN THE MIDST OF THE CLOUDS SEEMED A CELESTIAL VESSEL CAUGHT IN
THE ICE CAKES OF THE AIR
HE LOWERED HIS GAZE AND CONTEMPLATED FOR A MOMENT THROUGH THE RAILING
OF SLENDER COLUMNS WHICH UNITES THE TWO TOWERS FAR AWAY THROUGH A
GAUZE OF MISTS AND SMOKE THE SILENT THRONG OF THE ROOFS OF PARIS
POINTED INNUMERABLE CROWDED AND SMALL LIKE THE WAVES OF A TRANQUIL SEA
ON A SUM MER NIGHT
THE MOON CAST A FEEBLE RAY WHICH IMPARTED TO EARTH AND HEAVEN AN ASHY
HUE
AT THAT MOMENT THE CLOCK RAISED ITS SHRILL CRACKED VOICE
MIDNIGHT RANG
OUT
THE PRIEST THOUGHT OF MIDDAY TWELVE O'CLOCK HAD COME BACK AGAIN
OH HE SAID IN A VERY LOW TONE SHE MUST BE COLD NOW
ALL AT ONCE A GUST OF WIND EXTINGUISHED HIS LAMP AND ALMOST AT THE
SAME INSTANT HE BEHELD A SHADE A WHITENESS A FORM A WOMAN APPEAR
FROM THE OPPOSITE ANGLE OF THE TOWER
HE STARTED
BESIDE THIS WOMAN WAS
A LITTLE GOAT WHICH MINGLED ITS BLEAT WITH THE LAST BLEAT OF THE CLOCK
HE HAD STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LOOK
IT WAS SHE
SHE WAS PALE SHE WAS GLOOMY
HER HAIR FELL OVER HER SHOULDERS AS IN THE
MORNING BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER A ROPE ON HER NECK HER HANDS WERE NO
LONGER BOUND SHE WAS FREE SHE WAS DEAD
SHE WAS DRESSED IN WHITE AND HAD A WHITE VEIL ON HER HEAD
SHE CAME TOWARDS HIM SLOWLY WITH HER GAZE FIXED ON THE SKY
THE
SUPERNATURAL GOAT FOLLOWED HER
HE FELT AS THOUGH MADE OF STONE AND
TOO HEAVY TO FLEE
AT EVERY STEP WHICH SHE TOOK IN ADVANCE HE TOOK ONE
BACKWARDS AND THAT WAS ALL
IN THIS WAY HE RETREATED ONCE MORE BENEATH
THE GLOOMY ARCH OF THE STAIRWAY
HE WAS CHILLED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE
MIGHT ENTER THERE ALSO HAD SHE DONE SO HE WOULD HAVE DIED OF TERROR
SHE DID ARRIVE IN FACT IN FRONT OF THE DOOR TO THE STAIRWAY AND
PAUSED THERE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES STARED INTENTLY INTO THE DARKNESS BUT
WITHOUT APPEARING TO SEE THE PRIEST AND PASSED ON
SHE SEEMED TALLER
TO HIM THAN WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ALIVE HE SAW THE MOON THROUGH HER WHITE
ROBE HE HEARD HER BREATH
WHEN SHE HAD PASSED ON HE BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STAIRCASE AGAIN WITH
THE SLOWNESS WHICH HE HAD OBSERVED IN THE SPECTRE BELIEVING HIMSELF TO
BE A SPECTRE TOO HAGGARD WITH HAIR ON END HIS EXTINGUISHED LAMP STILL
IN HIS HAND AND AS HE DESCENDED THE SPIRAL STEPS HE DISTINCTLY HEARD
IN HIS EAR A VOICE LAUGHING AND REPEATING
A SPIRIT PASSED BEFORE MY FACE AND I HEARD A SMALL VOICE AND THE HAIR
OF MY FLESH STOOD UP
CHAPTER II
HUNCHBACKED ONE EYED LAME
EVERY CITY DURING THE MIDDLE AGES AND EVERY CITY IN FRANCE DOWN TO THE
TIME OF LOUIS XII
HAD ITS PLACES OF ASYLUM
THESE SANCTUARIES IN THE
MIDST OF THE DELUGE OF PENAL AND BARBAROUS JURISDICTIONS WHICH INUNDATED
THE CITY WERE A SPECIES OF ISLANDS WHICH ROSE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF HUMAN
JUSTICE
EVERY CRIMINAL WHO LANDED THERE WAS SAFE
THERE WERE IN EVERY
SUBURB ALMOST AS MANY PLACES OF ASYLUM AS GALLOWS
IT WAS THE ABUSE OF
IMPUNITY BY THE SIDE OF THE ABUSE OF PUNISHMENT TWO BAD THINGS WHICH
STROVE TO CORRECT EACH OTHER
THE PALACES OF THE KING THE HOTELS OF
THE PRINCES AND ESPECIALLY CHURCHES POSSESSED THE RIGHT OF ASYLUM
SOMETIMES A WHOLE CITY WHICH STOOD IN NEED OF BEING REPEOPLED WAS
TEMPORARILY CREATED A PLACE OF REFUGE
LOUIS XI
MADE ALL PARIS A REFUGE
IN 1467
HIS FOOT ONCE WITHIN THE ASYLUM THE CRIMINAL WAS SACRED BUT HE MUST
BEWARE OF LEAVING IT ONE STEP OUTSIDE THE SANCTUARY AND HE FELL BACK
INTO THE FLOOD
THE WHEEL THE GIBBET THE STRAPPADO KEPT GOOD GUARD
AROUND THE PLACE OF REFUGE AND LAY IN WATCH INCESSANTLY FOR THEIR PREY
LIKE SHARKS AROUND A VESSEL
HENCE CONDEMNED MEN WERE TO BE SEEN WHOSE
HAIR HAD GROWN WHITE IN A CLOISTER ON THE STEPS OF A PALACE IN THE
ENCLOSURE OF AN ABBEY BENEATH THE PORCH OF A CHURCH IN THIS MANNER THE
ASYLUM WAS A PRISON AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT
A SOLEMN DECREE OF PARLIAMENT VIOLATED THE ASYLUM AND RESTORED THE
CONDEMNED MAN TO THE EXECUTIONER BUT THIS WAS OF RARE OCCURRENCE
PARLIAMENTS WERE AFRAID OF THE BISHOPS AND WHEN THERE WAS FRICTION
BETWEEN THESE TWO ROBES THE GOWN HAD BUT A POOR CHANCE AGAINST THE
CASSOCK
SOMETIMES HOWEVER AS IN THE AFFAIR OF THE ASSASSINS OF
PETIT JEAN THE HEADSMAN OF PARIS AND IN THAT OF EMERY ROUSSEAU THE
MURDERER OF JEAN VALLERET JUSTICE OVERLEAPED THE CHURCH AND PASSED ON
TO THE EXECUTION OF ITS SENTENCES BUT UNLESS BY VIRTUE OF A DECREE OF
PARLIAMENT WOE TO HIM WHO VIOLATED A PLACE OF ASYLUM WITH ARMED FORCE
THE READER KNOWS THE MANNER OF DEATH OF ROBERT DE CLERMONT MARSHAL
OF FRANCE AND OF JEAN DE CHLONS MARSHAL OF CHAMPAGNE AND YET
THE QUESTION WAS ONLY OF A CERTAIN PERRIN MARC THE CLERK OF A
MONEY CHANGER A MISERABLE ASSASSIN BUT THE TWO MARSHALS HAD BROKEN THE
DOORS OF ST
MRY
THEREIN LAY THE ENORMITY
SUCH RESPECT WAS CHERISHED FOR PLACES OF REFUGE THAT ACCORDING TO
TRADITION ANIMALS EVEN FELT IT AT TIMES
AYMOIRE RELATES THAT A
STAG BEING CHASED BY DAGOBERT HAVING TAKEN REFUGE NEAR THE TOMB OF
SAINT DENIS THE PACK OF HOUNDS STOPPED SHORT AND BARKED
CHURCHES GENERALLY HAD A SMALL APARTMENT PREPARED FOR THE RECEPTION OF
SUPPLICANTS
IN 1407 NICOLAS FLAMEL CAUSED TO BE BUILT ON THE VAULTS OF
SAINT JACQUES DE LA BOUCHERIE A CHAMBER WHICH COST HIM FOUR LIVRES SIX
SOUS SIXTEEN FARTHINGS PARISIS
AT NOTRE DAME IT WAS A TINY CELL SITUATED ON THE ROOF OF THE SIDE AISLE
BENEATH THE FLYING BUTTRESSES PRECISELY AT THE SPOT WHERE THE WIFE OF
THE PRESENT JANITOR OF THE TOWERS HAS MADE FOR HERSELF A GARDEN WHICH
IS TO THE HANGING GARDENS OF BABYLON WHAT A LETTUCE IS TO A PALM TREE
WHAT A PORTER'S WIFE IS TO A SEMIRAMIS
IT WAS HERE THAT QUASIMODO HAD DEPOSITED LA ESMERALDA AFTER HIS WILD
AND TRIUMPHANT COURSE
AS LONG AS THAT COURSE LASTED THE YOUNG GIRL
HAD BEEN UNABLE TO RECOVER HER SENSES HALF UNCONSCIOUS HALF AWAKE NO
LONGER FEELING ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS MOUNTING THROUGH THE AIR
FLOATING IN IT FLYING IN IT THAT SOMETHING WAS RAISING HER ABOVE THE
EARTH
FROM TIME TO TIME SHE HEARD THE LOUD LAUGHTER THE NOISY VOICE
OF QUASIMODO IN HER EAR SHE HALF OPENED HER EYES THEN BELOW HER SHE
CONFUSEDLY BEHELD PARIS CHECKERED WITH ITS THOUSAND ROOFS OF SLATE AND
TILES LIKE A RED AND BLUE MOSAIC ABOVE HER HEAD THE FRIGHTFUL AND
JOYOUS FACE OF QUASIMODO
THEN HER EYELIDS DROOPED AGAIN SHE THOUGHT
THAT ALL WAS OVER THAT THEY HAD EXECUTED HER DURING HER SWOON AND THAT
THE MISSHAPEN SPIRIT WHICH HAD PRESIDED OVER HER DESTINY HAD LAID HOLD
OF HER AND WAS BEARING HER AWAY
SHE DARED NOT LOOK AT HIM AND SHE
SURRENDERED HERSELF TO HER FATE
BUT WHEN THE BELLRINGER DISHEVELLED
AND PANTING HAD DEPOSITED HER IN THE CELL OF REFUGE WHEN SHE FELT HIS
HUGE HANDS GENTLY DETACHING THE CORD WHICH BRUISED HER ARMS SHE FELT
THAT SORT OF SHOCK WHICH AWAKENS WITH A START THE PASSENGERS OF A VESSEL
WHICH RUNS AGROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF A DARK NIGHT
HER THOUGHTS
AWOKE ALSO AND RETURNED TO HER ONE BY ONE
SHE SAW THAT SHE WAS IN
NOTRE DAME SHE REMEMBERED HAVING BEEN TORN FROM THE HANDS OF THE
EXECUTIONER THAT PHOEBUS WAS ALIVE THAT PHOEBUS LOVED HER NO LONGER
AND AS THESE TWO IDEAS ONE OF WHICH SHED SO MUCH BITTERNESS OVER THE
OTHER PRESENTED THEMSELVES SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THE POOR CONDEMNED GIRL
SHE TURNED TO QUASIMODO WHO WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF HER AND WHO
TERRIFIED HER SHE SAID TO HIM WHY HAVE YOU SAVED ME
HE GAZED AT HER WITH ANXIETY AS THOUGH SEEKING TO DIVINE WHAT SHE WAS
SAYING TO HIM
SHE REPEATED HER QUESTION
THEN HE GAVE HER A PROFOUNDLY
SORROWFUL GLANCE AND FLED
SHE WAS ASTONISHED
A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE RETURNED BEARING A PACKAGE WHICH HE CAST AT
HER FEET
IT WAS CLOTHING WHICH SOME CHARITABLE WOMEN HAD LEFT ON THE
THRESHOLD OF THE CHURCH FOR HER
THEN SHE DROPPED HER EYES UPON HERSELF AND SAW THAT SHE WAS ALMOST
NAKED AND BLUSHED
LIFE HAD RETURNED
QUASIMODO APPEARED TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING OF THIS MODESTY
HE COVERED
HIS EYES WITH HIS LARGE HAND AND RETIRED ONCE MORE BUT SLOWLY
SHE MADE HASTE TO DRESS HERSELF
THE ROBE WAS A WHITE ONE WITH A WHITE
VEIL THE GARB OF A NOVICE OF THE HTEL DIEN
SHE HAD BARELY FINISHED WHEN SHE BEHELD QUASIMODO RETURNING
HE CARRIED
A BASKET UNDER ONE ARM AND A MATTRESS UNDER THE OTHER
IN THE BASKET
THERE WAS A BOTTLE BREAD AND SOME PROVISIONS
HE SET THE BASKET ON THE
FLOOR AND SAID EAT HE SPREAD THE MATTRESS ON THE FLAGGING AND SAID
SLEEP
IT WAS HIS OWN REPAST IT WAS HIS OWN BED WHICH THE BELLRINGER HAD GONE
IN SEARCH OF
THE GYPSY RAISED HER EYES TO THANK HIM BUT SHE COULD NOT ARTICULATE A
WORD
SHE DROPPED HER HEAD WITH A QUIVER OF TERROR
THEN HE SAID TO HER
I FRIGHTEN YOU
I AM VERY UGLY AM I NOT DO NOT LOOK AT ME ONLY
LISTEN TO ME
DURING THE DAY YOU WILL REMAIN HERE AT NIGHT YOU CAN WALK
ALL OVER THE CHURCH
BUT DO NOT LEAVE THE CHURCH EITHER BY DAY OR BY
NIGHT
YOU WOULD BE LOST
THEY WOULD KILL YOU AND I SHOULD DIE
SHE WAS TOUCHED AND RAISED HER HEAD TO ANSWER HIM
HE HAD DISAPPEARED
SHE FOUND HERSELF ALONE ONCE MORE MEDITATING UPON THE SINGULAR WORDS OF
THIS ALMOST MONSTROUS BEING AND STRUCK BY THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE WHICH
WAS SO HOARSE YET SO GENTLE
THEN SHE EXAMINED HER CELL
IT WAS A CHAMBER ABOUT SIX FEET SQUARE
WITH A SMALL WINDOW AND A DOOR ON THE SLIGHTLY SLOPING PLANE OF THE ROOF
FORMED OF FLAT STONES
MANY GUTTERS WITH THE FIGURES OF ANIMALS SEEMED
TO BE BENDING DOWN AROUND HER AND STRETCHING THEIR NECKS IN ORDER TO
STARE AT HER THROUGH THE WINDOW
OVER THE EDGE OF HER ROOF SHE PERCEIVED
THE TOPS OF THOUSANDS OF CHIMNEYS WHICH CAUSED THE SMOKE OF ALL THE
FIRES IN PARIS TO RISE BENEATH HER EYES
A SAD SIGHT FOR THE POOR GYPSY
A FOUNDLING CONDEMNED TO DEATH AN UNHAPPY CREATURE WITHOUT COUNTRY
WITHOUT FAMILY WITHOUT A HEARTHSTONE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE THOUGHT OF HER ISOLATION THUS APPEARED TO HER
MORE POIGNANT THAN EVER SHE FELT A BEARDED AND HAIRY HEAD GLIDE BETWEEN
HER HANDS UPON HER KNEES
SHE STARTED EVERYTHING ALARMED HER NOW AND
LOOKED
IT WAS THE POOR GOAT THE AGILE DJALI WHICH HAD MADE ITS ESCAPE
AFTER HER AT THE MOMENT WHEN QUASIMODO HAD PUT TO FLIGHT CHARMOLUE'S
BRIGADE AND WHICH HAD BEEN LAVISHING CARESSES ON HER FEET FOR NEARLY
AN HOUR PAST WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO WIN A GLANCE
THE GYPSY COVERED HIM
WITH KISSES
OH DJALI SHE SAID HOW I HAVE FORGOTTEN THEE AND SO THOU STILL
THINKEST OF ME OH THOU ART NOT AN INGRATE
AT THE SAME TIME AS THOUGH AN INVISIBLE HAND HAD LIFTED THE WEIGHT
WHICH HAD REPRESSED HER TEARS IN HER HEART FOR SO LONG SHE BEGAN TO
WEEP AND IN PROPORTION AS HER TEARS FLOWED SHE FELT ALL THAT WAS MOST
ACRID AND BITTER IN HER GRIEF DEPART WITH THEM
EVENING CAME SHE THOUGHT THE NIGHT SO BEAUTIFUL THAT SHE MADE THE
CIRCUIT OF THE ELEVATED GALLERY WHICH SURROUNDS THE CHURCH
IT AFFORDED
HER SOME RELIEF SO CALM DID THE EARTH APPEAR WHEN VIEWED FROM THAT
HEIGHT
CHAPTER III
DEAF
ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING SHE PERCEIVED ON AWAKING THAT SHE HAD
BEEN ASLEEP
THIS SINGULAR THING ASTONISHED HER
SHE HAD BEEN SO LONG
UNACCUSTOMED TO SLEEP A JOYOUS RAY OF THE RISING SUN ENTERED THROUGH
HER WINDOW AND TOUCHED HER FACE
AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE SUN SHE
BEHELD AT THAT WINDOW AN OBJECT WHICH FRIGHTENED HER THE UNFORTUNATE
FACE OF QUASIMODO
SHE INVOLUNTARILY CLOSED HER EYES AGAIN BUT IN VAIN
SHE FANCIED THAT SHE STILL SAW THROUGH THE ROSY LIDS THAT GNOME'S MASK
ONE EYED AND GAP TOOTHED
THEN WHILE SHE STILL KEPT HER EYES CLOSED
SHE HEARD A ROUGH VOICE SAYING VERY GENTLY
BE NOT AFRAID
I AM YOUR FRIEND
I CAME TO WATCH YOU SLEEP
IT DOES NOT
HURT YOU IF I COME TO SEE YOU SLEEP DOES IT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT
MAKE TO YOU IF I AM HERE WHEN YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED NOW I AM GOING
STAY I HAVE PLACED MYSELF BEHIND THE WALL
YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES
AGAIN
THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE PLAINTIVE THAN THESE WORDS AND THAT WAS THE
ACCENT IN WHICH THEY WERE UTTERED
THE GYPSY MUCH TOUCHED OPENED
HER EYES
HE WAS IN FACT NO LONGER AT THE WINDOW
SHE APPROACHED THE
OPENING AND BEHELD THE POOR HUNCHBACK CROUCHING IN AN ANGLE OF THE
WALL IN A SAD AND RESIGNED ATTITUDE
SHE MADE AN EFFORT TO SURMOUNT THE
REPUGNANCE WITH WHICH HE INSPIRED HER
COME SHE SAID TO HIM GENTLY
FROM THE MOVEMENT OF THE GYPSY'S LIPS QUASIMODO THOUGHT THAT SHE
WAS DRIVING HIM AWAY THEN HE ROSE AND RETIRED LIMPING SLOWLY WITH
DROOPING HEAD WITHOUT EVEN DARING TO RAISE TO THE YOUNG GIRL HIS GAZE
FULL OF DESPAIR
DO COME SHE CRIED BUT HE CONTINUED TO RETREAT
THEN
SHE DARTED FROM HER CELL RAN TO HIM AND GRASPED HIS ARM
ON FEELING
HER TOUCH HIM QUASIMODO TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB
HE RAISED HIS SUPPLIANT
EYE AND SEEING THAT SHE WAS LEADING HIM BACK TO HER QUARTERS HIS WHOLE
FACE BEAMED WITH JOY AND TENDERNESS
SHE TRIED TO MAKE HIM ENTER THE
CELL BUT HE PERSISTED IN REMAINING ON THE THRESHOLD
NO NO SAID HE
THE OWL ENTERS NOT THE NEST OF THE LARK
THEN SHE CROUCHED DOWN GRACEFULLY ON HER COUCH WITH HER GOAT ASLEEP AT
HER FEET
BOTH REMAINED MOTIONLESS FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS CONSIDERING
IN SILENCE SHE SO MUCH GRACE HE SO MUCH UGLINESS
EVERY MOMENT SHE
DISCOVERED SOME FRESH DEFORMITY IN QUASIMODO
HER GLANCE TRAVELLED FROM
HIS KNOCK KNEES TO HIS HUMPED BACK FROM HIS HUMPED BACK TO HIS ONLY
EYE
SHE COULD NOT COMPREHEND THE EXISTENCE OF A BEING SO AWKWARDLY
FASHIONED
YET THERE WAS SO MUCH SADNESS AND SO MUCH GENTLENESS SPREAD
OVER ALL THIS THAT SHE BEGAN TO BECOME RECONCILED TO IT
HE WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE
SO YOU WERE TELLING ME TO
RETURN
SHE MADE AN AFFIRMATIVE SIGN OF THE HEAD AND SAID YES
HE UNDERSTOOD THE MOTION OF THE HEAD
ALAS HE SAID AS THOUGH
HESITATING WHETHER TO FINISH I AM I AM DEAF
POOR MAN EXCLAIMED THE BOHEMIAN WITH AN EXPRESSION OF KINDLY PITY
HE BEGAN TO SMILE SADLY
YOU THINK THAT THAT WAS ALL THAT I LACKED DO YOU NOT YES I AM
DEAF THAT IS THE WAY I AM MADE
'TIS HORRIBLE IS IT NOT YOU ARE SO
BEAUTIFUL
THERE LAY IN THE ACCENTS OF THE WRETCHED MAN SO PROFOUND A CONSCIOUSNESS
OF HIS MISERY THAT SHE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO SAY A WORD
BESIDES HE
WOULD NOT HAVE HEARD HER
HE WENT ON
NEVER HAVE I SEEN MY UGLINESS AS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
WHEN I COMPARE
MYSELF TO YOU I FEEL A VERY GREAT PITY FOR MYSELF POOR UNHAPPY MONSTER
THAT I AM TELL ME I MUST LOOK TO YOU LIKE A BEAST
YOU YOU ARE A
RAY OF SUNSHINE A DROP OF DEW THE SONG OF A BIRD I AM SOMETHING
FRIGHTFUL NEITHER MAN NOR ANIMAL I KNOW NOT WHAT HARDER MORE
TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT AND MORE UNSHAPELY THAN A PEBBLE STONE
THEN HE BEGAN TO LAUGH AND THAT LAUGH WAS THE MOST HEARTBREAKING THING
IN THE WORLD
HE CONTINUED
YES I AM DEAF BUT YOU SHALL TALK TO ME BY GESTURES BY SIGNS
I HAVE
A MASTER WHO TALKS WITH ME IN THAT WAY
AND THEN I SHALL VERY SOON KNOW
YOUR WISH FROM THE MOVEMENT OF YOUR LIPS FROM YOUR LOOK
WELL SHE INTERPOSED WITH A SMILE TELL ME WHY YOU SAVED ME
HE WATCHED HER ATTENTIVELY WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING
I UNDERSTAND HE REPLIED
YOU ASK ME WHY I SAVED YOU
YOU HAVE
FORGOTTEN A WRETCH WHO TRIED TO ABDUCT YOU ONE NIGHT A WRETCH TO WHOM
YOU RENDERED SUCCOR ON THE FOLLOWING DAY ON THEIR INFAMOUS PILLORY
A
DROP OF WATER AND A LITTLE PITY THAT IS MORE THAN I CAN REPAY WITH MY
LIFE
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT WRETCH BUT HE REMEMBERS IT
SHE LISTENED TO HIM WITH PROFOUND TENDERNESS
A TEAR SWAM IN THE EYE OF
THE BELLRINGER BUT DID NOT FALL
HE SEEMED TO MAKE IT A SORT OF POINT
OF HONOR TO RETAIN IT
LISTEN HE RESUMED WHEN HE WAS NO LONGER AFRAID THAT THE TEAR WOULD
ESCAPE OUR TOWERS HERE ARE VERY HIGH A MAN WHO SHOULD FALL FROM THEM
WOULD BE DEAD BEFORE TOUCHING THE PAVEMENT WHEN IT SHALL PLEASE YOU
TO HAVE ME FALL YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO UTTER EVEN A WORD A GLANCE WILL
SUFFICE
THEN HE ROSE
UNHAPPY AS WAS THE BOHEMIAN THIS ECCENTRIC BEING STILL
AROUSED SOME COMPASSION IN HER
SHE MADE HIM A SIGN TO REMAIN
NO NO SAID HE I MUST NOT REMAIN TOO LONG
I AM NOT AT MY EASE
IT
IS OUT OF PITY THAT YOU DO NOT TURN AWAY YOUR EYES
I SHALL GO TO SOME
PLACE WHERE I CAN SEE YOU WITHOUT YOUR SEEING ME IT WILL BE BETTER SO
HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A LITTLE METAL WHISTLE
HERE SAID HE WHEN YOU HAVE NEED OF ME WHEN YOU WISH ME TO COME
WHEN YOU WILL NOT FEEL TOO RANCH HORROR AT THE SIGHT OF ME USE THIS
WHISTLE
I CAN HEAR THIS SOUND
HE LAID THE WHISTLE ON THE FLOOR AND FLED
CHAPTER IV
EARTHENWARE AND CRYSTAL
DAY FOLLOWED DAY
CALM GRADUALLY RETURNED TO THE SOUL OF LA ESMERALDA
EXCESS OF GRIEF LIKE EXCESS OF JOY IS A VIOLENT THING WHICH LASTS BUT
A SHORT TIME
THE HEART OF MAN CANNOT REMAIN LONG IN ONE EXTREMITY
THE
GYPSY HAD SUFFERED SO MUCH THAT NOTHING WAS LEFT HER BUT ASTONISHMENT
WITH SECURITY HOPE HAD RETURNED TO HER
SHE WAS OUTSIDE THE PALE OF
SOCIETY OUTSIDE THE PALE OF LIFE BUT SHE HAD A VAGUE FEELING THAT IT
MIGHT NOT BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN TO IT
SHE WAS LIKE A DEAD PERSON WHO
SHOULD HOLD IN RESERVE THE KEY TO HER TOMB
SHE FELT THE TERRIBLE IMAGES WHICH HAD SO LONG PERSECUTED HER
GRADUALLY DEPARTING
ALL THE HIDEOUS PHANTOMS PIERRAT TORTERUE JACQUES
CHARMOLUE WERE EFFACED FROM HER MIND ALL EVEN THE PRIEST
AND THEN PHOEBUS WAS ALIVE SHE WAS SURE OF IT SHE HAD SEEN HIM
TO
HER THE FACT OF PHOEBUS BEING ALIVE WAS EVERYTHING
AFTER THE SERIES OF
FATAL SHOCKS WHICH HAD OVERTURNED EVERYTHING WITHIN HER SHE HAD FOUND
BUT ONE THING INTACT IN HER SOUL ONE SENTIMENT HER LOVE FOR THE
CAPTAIN
LOVE IS LIKE A TREE IT SPROUTS FORTH OF ITSELF SENDS ITS
ROOTS OUT DEEPLY THROUGH OUR WHOLE BEING AND OFTEN CONTINUES TO
FLOURISH GREENLY OVER A HEART IN RUINS
AND THE INEXPLICABLE POINT ABOUT IT IS THAT THE MORE BLIND IS THIS
PASSION THE MORE TENACIOUS IT IS
IT IS NEVER MORE SOLID THAN WHEN IT
HAS NO REASON IN IT
LA ESMERALDA DID NOT THINK OF THE CAPTAIN WITHOUT BITTERNESS NO DOUBT
NO DOUBT IT WAS TERRIBLE THAT HE ALSO SHOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED THAT HE
SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT IMPOSSIBLE THING THAT HE COULD HAVE CONCEIVED
OF A STAB DEALT BY HER WHO WOULD HAVE GIVEN A THOUSAND LIVES FOR HIM
BUT AFTER ALL SHE MUST NOT BE TOO ANGRY WITH HIM FOR IT HAD SHE NOT
CONFESSED HER CRIME HAD SHE NOT YIELDED WEAK WOMAN THAT SHE WAS TO
TORTURE THE FAULT WAS ENTIRELY HERS
SHE SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED HER FINGER
NAILS TO BE TORN OUT RATHER THAN SUCH A WORD TO BE WRENCHED FROM HER
IN
SHORT IF SHE COULD BUT SEE PHOEBUS ONCE MORE FOR A SINGLE MINUTE
ONLY ONE WORD WOULD BE REQUIRED ONE LOOK IN ORDER TO UNDECEIVE HIM
TO BRING HIM BACK
SHE DID NOT DOUBT IT
SHE WAS ASTONISHED ALSO AT MANY
SINGULAR THINGS AT THE ACCIDENT OF PHOEBUS'S PRESENCE ON THE DAY OF THE
PENANCE AT THE YOUNG GIRL WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN
SHE WAS HIS SISTER NO
DOUBT
AN UNREASONABLE EXPLANATION BUT SHE CONTENTED HERSELF WITH IT
BECAUSE SHE NEEDED TO BELIEVE THAT PHOEBUS STILL LOVED HER AND LOVED
HER ALONE
HAD HE NOT SWORN IT TO HER WHAT MORE WAS NEEDED SIMPLE AND
CREDULOUS AS SHE WAS AND THEN IN THIS MATTER WERE NOT APPEARANCES
MUCH MORE AGAINST HER THAN AGAINST HIM ACCORDINGLY SHE WAITED
SHE
HOPED
LET US ADD THAT THE CHURCH THAT VAST CHURCH WHICH SURROUNDED HER ON
EVERY SIDE WHICH GUARDED HER WHICH SAVED HER WAS ITSELF A SOVEREIGN
TRANQUILLIZER
THE SOLEMN LINES OF THAT ARCHITECTURE THE RELIGIOUS
ATTITUDE OF ALL THE OBJECTS WHICH SURROUNDED THE YOUNG GIRL THE SERENE
AND PIOUS THOUGHTS WHICH EMANATED SO TO SPEAK FROM ALL THE PORES OF
THAT STONE ACTED UPON HER WITHOUT HER BEING AWARE OF IT
THE EDIFICE
HAD ALSO SOUNDS FRAUGHT WITH SUCH BENEDICTION AND SUCH MAJESTY
THAT THEY SOOTHED THIS AILING SOUL
THE MONOTONOUS CHANTING OF THE
CELEBRANTS THE RESPONSES OF THE PEOPLE TO THE PRIEST SOMETIMES
INARTICULATE SOMETIMES THUNDEROUS THE HARMONIOUS TREMBLING OF THE
PAINTED WINDOWS THE ORGAN BURSTING FORTH LIKE A HUNDRED TRUMPETS THE
THREE BELFRIES HUMMING LIKE HIVES OF HUGE BEES THAT WHOLE ORCHESTRA ON
WHICH BOUNDED A GIGANTIC SCALE ASCENDING DESCENDING INCESSANTLY
FROM THE VOICE OF A THRONG TO THAT OF ONE BELL DULLED HER MEMORY HER
IMAGINATION HER GRIEF
THE BELLS IN PARTICULAR LULLED HER
IT WAS
SOMETHING LIKE A POWERFUL MAGNETISM WHICH THOSE VAST INSTRUMENTS SHED
OVER HER IN GREAT WAVES
THUS EVERY SUNRISE FOUND HER MORE CALM BREATHING BETTER LESS PALE
IN
PROPORTION AS HER INWARD WOUNDS CLOSED HER GRACE AND BEAUTY BLOSSOMED
ONCE MORE ON HER COUNTENANCE BUT MORE THOUGHTFUL MORE REPOSEFUL
HER
FORMER CHARACTER ALSO RETURNED TO HER SOMEWHAT EVEN OF HER GAYETY HER
PRETTY POUT HER LOVE FOR HER GOAT HER LOVE FOR SINGING HER MODESTY
SHE TOOK CARE TO DRESS HERSELF IN THE MORNING IN THE CORNER OF HER
CELL FOR FEAR SOME INHABITANTS OF THE NEIGHBORING ATTICS MIGHT SEE HER
THROUGH THE WINDOW
WHEN THE THOUGHT OF PHOEBUS LEFT HER TIME THE GYPSY SOMETIMES THOUGHT
OF QUASIMODO
HE WAS THE SOLE BOND THE SOLE CONNECTION THE SOLE
COMMUNICATION WHICH REMAINED TO HER WITH MEN WITH THE LIVING
UNFORTUNATE GIRL SHE WAS MORE OUTSIDE THE WORLD THAN QUASIMODO
SHE
UNDERSTOOD NOT IN THE LEAST THE STRANGE FRIEND WHOM CHANCE HAD GIVEN
HER
SHE OFTEN REPROACHED HERSELF FOR NOT FEELING A GRATITUDE WHICH
SHOULD CLOSE HER EYES BUT DECIDEDLY SHE COULD NOT ACCUSTOM HERSELF TO
THE POOR BELLRINGER
HE WAS TOO UGLY
SHE HAD LEFT THE WHISTLE WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HER LYING ON THE GROUND
THIS DID NOT PREVENT QUASIMODO FROM MAKING HIS APPEARANCE FROM TIME TO
TIME DURING THE FIRST FEW DAYS
SHE DID HER BEST NOT TO TURN ASIDE WITH
TOO MUCH REPUGNANCE WHEN HE CAME TO BRING HER HER BASKET OF PROVISIONS
OR HER JUG OF WATER BUT HE ALWAYS PERCEIVED THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT OF
THIS SORT AND THEN HE WITHDREW SADLY
ONCE HE CAME AT THE MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS CARESSING DJALI
HE STOOD
PENSIVELY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE THIS GRACEFUL GROUP OF THE GOAT AND
THE GYPSY AT LAST HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAVY AND ILL FORMED HEAD
MY MISFORTUNE IS THAT I STILL RESEMBLE A MAN TOO MUCH
I SHOULD LIKE TO
BE WHOLLY A BEAST LIKE THAT GOAT
SHE GAZED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT
HE REPLIED TO THE GLANCE
OH I WELL KNOW WHY AND HE WENT AWAY
ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR OF THE CELL WHICH
HE NEVER ENTERED AT THE MOMENT WHEN LA ESMERALDA WAS SINGING AN OLD
SPANISH BALLAD THE WORDS OF WHICH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT WHICH HAD
LINGERED IN HER EAR BECAUSE THE GYPSY WOMEN HAD LULLED HER TO SLEEP
WITH IT WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE CHILD
AT THE SIGHT OF THAT VILLANOUS FORM
WHICH MADE ITS APPEARANCE SO ABRUPTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF HER SONG THE
YOUNG GIRL PAUSED WITH AN INVOLUNTARY GESTURE OF ALARM
THE UNHAPPY
BELLRINGER FELL UPON HIS KNEES ON THE THRESHOLD AND CLASPED HIS LARGE
MISSHAPEN HANDS WITH A SUPPLIANT AIR
OH HE SAID SORROWFULLY
CONTINUE I IMPLORE YOU AND DO NOT DRIVE ME AWAY SHE DID NOT WISH TO
PAIN HIM AND RESUMED HER LAY TREMBLING ALL OVER
BY DEGREES HOWEVER
HER TERROR DISAPPEARED AND SHE YIELDED HERSELF WHOLLY TO THE SLOW AND
MELANCHOLY AIR WHICH SHE WAS SINGING
HE REMAINED ON HIS KNEES WITH
HANDS CLASPED AS IN PRAYER ATTENTIVE HARDLY BREATHING HIS GAZE
RIVETED UPON THE GYPSY'S BRILLIANT EYES
ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE CAME TO HER WITH AN AWKWARD AND TIMID AIR
LISTEN HE SAID WITH AN EFFORT I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU
SHE MADE HIM A SIGN THAT SHE WAS LISTENING
THEN HE BEGAN TO SIGH HALF
OPENED HIS LIPS APPEARED FOR A MOMENT TO BE ON THE POINT OF SPEAKING
THEN HE LOOKED AT HER AGAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WITHDREW SLOWLY WITH
HIS BROW IN HIS HAND LEAVING THE GYPSY STUPEFIED
AMONG THE GROTESQUE
PERSONAGES SCULPTURED ON THE WALL THERE WAS ONE TO WHOM HE WAS
PARTICULARLY ATTACHED AND WITH WHICH HE OFTEN SEEMED TO EXCHANGE
FRATERNAL GLANCES
ONCE THE GYPSY HEARD HIM SAYING TO IT
OH WHY AM NOT I OF STONE LIKE YOU
AT LAST ONE MORNING LA ESMERALDA HAD ADVANCED TO THE EDGE OF THE ROOF
AND WAS LOOKING INTO THE PLACE OVER THE POINTED ROOF OF SAINT JEAN LE
ROND
QUASIMODO WAS STANDING BEHIND HER
HE HAD PLACED HIMSELF IN THAT
POSITION IN ORDER TO SPARE THE YOUNG GIRL AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE
DISPLEASURE OF SEEING HIM
ALL AT ONCE THE GYPSY STARTED A TEAR AND A
FLASH OF JOY GLEAMED SIMULTANEOUSLY IN HER EYES SHE KNELT ON THE
BRINK OF THE ROOF AND EXTENDED HER ARMS TOWARDS THE PLACE WITH ANGUISH
EXCLAIMING PHOEBUS COME COME A WORD A SINGLE WORD IN THE NAME OF
HEAVEN PHOEBUS PHOEBUS HER VOICE HER FACE HER GESTURE HER WHOLE
PERSON BORE THE HEARTRENDING EXPRESSION OF A SHIPWRECKED MAN WHO IS
MAKING A SIGNAL OF DISTRESS TO THE JOYOUS VESSEL WHICH IS PASSING AFAR
OFF IN A RAY OF SUNLIGHT ON THE HORIZON
QUASIMODO LEANED OVER THE PLACE AND SAW THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS TENDER
AND AGONIZING PRAYER WAS A YOUNG MAN A CAPTAIN A HANDSOME CAVALIER
ALL GLITTERING WITH ARMS AND DECORATIONS PRANCING ACROSS THE END OF THE
PLACE AND SALUTING WITH HIS PLUME A BEAUTIFUL LADY WHO WAS SMILING AT
HIM FROM HER BALCONY
HOWEVER THE OFFICER DID NOT HEAR THE UNHAPPY GIRL
CALLING HIM HE WAS TOO FAR AWAY
BUT THE POOR DEAF MAN HEARD
A PROFOUND SIGH HEAVED HIS BREAST HE
TURNED ROUND HIS HEART WAS SWOLLEN WITH ALL THE TEARS WHICH HE WAS
SWALLOWING HIS CONVULSIVELY CLENCHED FISTS STRUCK AGAINST HIS HEAD AND
WHEN HE WITHDREW THEM THERE WAS A BUNCH OF RED HAIR IN EACH HAND
THE GYPSY PAID NO HEED TO HIM
HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AS HE GNASHED HIS
TEETH
DAMNATION THAT IS WHAT ONE SHOULD BE LIKE 'TIS ONLY NECESSARY TO BE
HANDSOME ON THE OUTSIDE
MEANWHILE SHE REMAINED KNEELING AND CRIED WITH EXTRAOR DINARY
AGITATION OH THERE HE IS ALIGHTING FROM HIS HORSE HE IS ABOUT TO
ENTER THAT HOUSE PHOEBUS HE DOES NOT HEAR ME PHOEBUS HOW WICKED
THAT WOMAN IS TO SPEAK TO HIM AT THE SAME TIME WITH ME PHOEBUS
PHOEBUS
THE DEAF MAN GAZED AT HER
HE UNDERSTOOD THIS PANTOMIME
THE POOR
BELLRINGER'S EYE FILLED WITH TEARS BUT HE LET NONE FALL
ALL AT ONCE HE
PULLED HER GENTLY BY THE BORDER OF HER SLEEVE
SHE TURNED ROUND
HE HAD
ASSUMED A TRANQUIL AIR HE SAID TO HER
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME BRING HIM TO YOU
SHE UTTERED A CRY OF JOY
OH GO HASTEN RUN QUICK THAT CAPTAIN THAT CAPTAIN BRING HIM TO
ME I WILL LOVE YOU FOR IT
SHE CLASPED HIS KNEES
HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SHAKING HIS HEAD SADLY
I WILL BRING HIM TO YOU HE SAID IN A WEAK VOICE
THEN HE TURNED HIS
HEAD AND PLUNGED DOWN THE STAIRCASE WITH GREAT STRIDES STIFLING WITH
SOBS
WHEN HE REACHED THE PLACE HE NO LONGER SAW ANYTHING EXCEPT THE HANDSOME
HORSE HITCHED AT THE DOOR OF THE GONDELAURIER HOUSE THE CAPTAIN HAD
JUST ENTERED THERE
HE RAISED HIS EYES TO THE ROOF OF THE CHURCH
LA ESMERALDA WAS THERE
IN THE SAME SPOT IN THE SAME ATTITUDE
HE MADE HER A SAD SIGN WITH HIS
HEAD THEN HE PLANTED HIS BACK AGAINST ONE OF THE STONE POSTS OF THE
GONDELAURIER PORCH DETERMINED TO WAIT UNTIL THE CAPTAIN SHOULD COME
FORTH
IN THE GONDELAURIER HOUSE IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GALA DAYS WHICH PRECEDE
A WEDDING
QUASIMODO BEHELD MANY PEOPLE ENTER BUT NO ONE COME OUT
HE
CAST A GLANCE TOWARDS THE ROOF FROM TIME TO TIME THE GYPSY DID NOT STIR
ANY MORE THAN HIMSELF
A GROOM CAME AND UNHITCHED THE HORSE AND LED IT
TO THE STABLE OF THE HOUSE
THE ENTIRE DAY PASSED THUS QUASIMODO AT HIS POST LA ESMERALDA ON THE
ROOF PHOEBUS NO DOUBT AT THE FEET OF FLEUR DE LYS
AT LENGTH NIGHT CAME A MOONLESS NIGHT A DARK NIGHT
QUASIMODO
FIXED HIS GAZE IN VAIN UPON LA ESMERALDA SOON SHE WAS NO MORE THAN
A WHITENESS AMID THE TWILIGHT THEN NOTHING
ALL WAS EFFACED ALL WAS
BLACK
QUASIMODO BEHELD THE FRONT WINDOWS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM OF THE
GONDELAURIER MANSION ILLUMINATED HE SAW THE OTHER CASEMENTS IN THE
PLACE LIGHTED ONE BY ONE HE ALSO SAW THEM EXTINGUISHED TO THE VERY
LAST FOR HE REMAINED THE WHOLE EVENING AT HIS POST
THE OFFICER DID NOT
COME FORTH
WHEN THE LAST PASSERS BY HAD RETURNED HOME WHEN THE WINDOWS
OF ALL THE OTHER HOUSES WERE EXTINGUISHED QUASIMODO WAS LEFT ENTIRELY
ALONE ENTIRELY IN THE DARK
THERE WERE AT THAT TIME NO LAMPS IN THE
SQUARE BEFORE NOTRE DAME
MEANWHILE THE WINDOWS OF THE GONDELAURIER MANSION REMAINED LIGHTED
EVEN AFTER MIDNIGHT
QUASIMODO MOTIONLESS AND ATTENTIVE BEHELD A
THRONG OF LIVELY DANCING SHADOWS PASS ATHWART THE MANY COLORED
PAINTED PANES
HAD HE NOT BEEN DEAF HE WOULD HAVE HEARD MORE AND MORE
DISTINCTLY IN PROPORTION AS THE NOISE OF SLEEPING PARIS DIED AWAY A
SOUND OF FEASTING LAUGHTER AND MUSIC IN THE GONDELAURIER MANSION
TOWARDS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE GUESTS BEGAN TO TAKE THEIR
LEAVE
QUASIMODO SHROUDED IN DARKNESS WATCHED THEM ALL PASS OUT THROUGH
THE PORCH ILLUMINATED WITH TORCHES
NONE OF THEM WAS THE CAPTAIN
HE WAS FILLED WITH SAD THOUGHTS AT TIMES HE LOOKED UPWARDS INTO THE
AIR LIKE A PERSON WHO IS WEARY OF WAITING
GREAT BLACK CLOUDS HEAVY
TORN SPLIT HUNG LIKE CRAPE HAMMOCKS BENEATH THE STARRY DOME OF NIGHT
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED THEM SPIDERS' WEBS OF THE VAULT OF HEAVEN
IN ONE OF THESE MOMENTS HE SUDDENLY BEHELD THE LONG WINDOW ON THE
BALCONY WHOSE STONE BALUSTRADE PROJECTED ABOVE HIS HEAD OPEN
MYSTERIOUSLY
THE FRAIL GLASS DOOR GAVE PASSAGE TO TWO PERSONS AND
CLOSED NOISELESSLY BEHIND THEM IT WAS A MAN AND A WOMAN
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THAT QUASIMODO SUCCEEDED IN RECOGNIZING
IN THE MAN THE HANDSOME CAPTAIN IN THE WOMAN THE YOUNG LADY WHOM HE
HAD SEEN WELCOME THE OFFICER IN THE MORNING FROM THAT VERY BALCONY
THE
PLACE WAS PERFECTLY DARK AND A DOUBLE CRIMSON CURTAIN WHICH HAD FALLEN
ACROSS THE DOOR THE VERY MOMENT IT CLOSED AGAIN ALLOWED NO LIGHT TO
REACH THE BALCONY FROM THE APARTMENT
THE YOUNG MAN AND THE YOUNG GIRL SO FAR AS OUR DEAF MAN COULD JUDGE
WITHOUT HEARING A SINGLE ONE OF THEIR WORDS APPEARED TO ABANDON
THEMSELVES TO A VERY TENDER TTE A TTE
THE YOUNG GIRL SEEMED TO HAVE
ALLOWED THE OFFICER TO MAKE A GIRDLE FOR HER OF HIS ARM AND GENTLY
REPULSED A KISS
QUASIMODO LOOKED ON FROM BELOW AT THIS SCENE WHICH WAS ALL THE MORE
PLEASING TO WITNESS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE SEEN
HE CONTEMPLATED
WITH BITTERNESS THAT BEAUTY THAT HAPPINESS
AFTER ALL NATURE WAS NOT
DUMB IN THE POOR FELLOW AND HIS HUMAN SENSIBILITY ALL MALICIOUSLY
CONTORTED AS IT WAS QUIVERED NO LESS THAN ANY OTHER
HE THOUGHT OF THE
MISERABLE PORTION WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD ALLOTTED TO HIM THAT WOMAN AND
THE PLEASURE OF LOVE WOULD PASS FOREVER BEFORE HIS EYES AND THAT HE
SHOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING BUT BEHOLD THE FELICITY OF OTHERS
BUT THAT
WHICH RENT HIS HEART MOST IN THIS SIGHT THAT WHICH MINGLED INDIGNATION
WITH HIS ANGER WAS THE THOUGHT OF WHAT THE GYPSY WOULD SUFFER COULD SHE
BEHOLD IT
IT IS TRUE THAT THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK THAT LA ESMERALDA
IF SHE HAD REMAINED AT HER POST AND HE HAD NO DOUBT OF THIS WAS VERY
FAR AWAY AND THAT IT WAS ALL THAT HE HIMSELF COULD DO TO DISTINGUISH
THE LOVERS ON THE BALCONY
THIS CONSOLED HIM
MEANWHILE THEIR CONVERSATION GREW MORE AND MORE ANIMATED
THE YOUNG
LADY APPEARED TO BE ENTREATING THE OFFICER TO ASK NOTHING MORE OF HER
OF ALL THIS QUASIMODO COULD DISTINGUISH ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL CLASPED
HANDS THE SMILES MINGLED WITH TEARS THE YOUNG GIRL'S GLANCES DIRECTED
TO THE STARS THE EYES OF THE CAPTAIN LOWERED ARDENTLY UPON HER
FORTUNATELY FOR THE YOUNG GIRL WAS BEGINNING TO RESIST BUT FEEBLY THE
DOOR OF THE BALCONY SUDDENLY OPENED ONCE MORE AND AN OLD DAME APPEARED
THE BEAUTY SEEMED CONFUSED THE OFFICER ASSUMED AN AIR OF DISPLEASURE
AND ALL THREE WITHDREW
A MOMENT LATER A HORSE WAS CHAMPING HIS BIT UNDER THE PORCH AND THE
BRILLIANT OFFICER ENVELOPED IN HIS NIGHT CLOAK PASSED RAPIDLY BEFORE
QUASIMODO
THE BELLRINGER ALLOWED HIM TO TURN THE CORNER OF THE STREET THEN HE RAN
AFTER HIM WITH HIS APE LIKE AGILITY SHOUTING HEY THERE CAPTAIN
THE CAPTAIN HALTED
WHAT WANTS THIS KNAVE WITH ME HE SAID CATCHING SIGHT THROUGH THE
GLOOM OF THAT HIPSHOT FORM WHICH RAN LIMPING AFTER HIM
MEANWHILE QUASIMODO HAD CAUGHT UP WITH HIM AND HAD BOLDLY GRASPED HIS
HORSE'S BRIDLE FOLLOW ME CAPTAIN THERE IS ONE HERE WHO DESIRES TO
SPEAK WITH YOU
CORNEMAHOM GRUMBLED PHOEBUS HERE'S A VILLANOUS RUFFLED BIRD
WHICH I FANCY I HAVE SEEN SOMEWHERE
HOL MASTER WILL YOU LET MY
HORSE'S BRIDLE ALONE
CAPTAIN REPLIED THE DEAF MAN DO YOU NOT ASK ME WHO IT IS
I TELL YOU TO RELEASE MY HORSE RETORTED PHOEBUS IMPATIENTLY
WHAT
MEANS THE KNAVE BY CLINGING TO THE BRIDLE OF MY STEED DO YOU TAKE MY
HORSE FOR A GALLOWS
QUASIMODO FAR FROM RELEASING THE BRIDLE PREPARED TO FORCE HIM TO
RETRACE HIS STEPS
UNABLE TO COMPREHEND THE CAPTAIN'S RESISTANCE HE
HASTENED TO SAY TO HIM
COME CAPTAIN 'TIS A WOMAN WHO IS WAITING FOR YOU HE ADDED WITH AN
EFFORT A WOMAN WHO LOVES YOU
A RARE RASCAL SAID THE CAPTAIN WHO THINKS ME OBLIGED TO GO TO ALL
THE WOMEN WHO LOVE ME OR WHO SAY THEY DO
AND WHAT IF BY CHANCE SHE
SHOULD RESEMBLE YOU YOU FACE OF A SCREECH OWL TELL THE WOMAN WHO HAS
SENT YOU THAT I AM ABOUT TO MARRY AND THAT SHE MAY GO TO THE DEVIL
LISTEN EXCLAIMED QUASIMODO THINKING TO OVERCOME HIS HESITATION WITH
A WORD COME MONSEIGNEUR 'TIS THE GYPSY WHOM YOU KNOW
THIS WORD DID INDEED PRODUCE A GREAT EFFECT ON PHOEBUS BUT NOT OF THE
KIND WHICH THE DEAF MAN EXPECTED
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT OUR GALLANT
OFFICER HAD RETIRED WITH FLEUR DE LYS SEVERAL MOMENTS BEFORE QUASIMODO
HAD RESCUED THE CONDEMNED GIRL FROM THE HANDS OF CHARMOLUE
AFTERWARDS
IN ALL HIS VISITS TO THE GONDELAURIER MANSION HE HAD TAKEN CARE NOT TO
MENTION THAT WOMAN THE MEMORY OF WHOM WAS AFTER ALL PAINFUL TO HIM
AND ON HER SIDE FLEUR DE LYS HAD NOT DEEMED IT POLITIC TO TELL HIM THAT
THE GYPSY WAS ALIVE
HENCE PHOEBUS BELIEVED POOR SIMILAR TO BE DEAD
AND THAT A MONTH OR TWO HAD ELAPSED SINCE HER DEATH
LET US ADD THAT
FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN REFLECTING ON THE PROFOUND
DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT THE SUPERNATURAL UGLINESS THE SEPULCHRAL VOICE
OF THE STRANGE MESSENGER THAT IT WAS PAST MIDNIGHT THAT THE STREET WAS
DESERTED AS ON THE EVENING WHEN THE SURLY MONK HAD ACCOSTED HIM AND
THAT HIS HORSE SNORTED AS IT LOOKED AT QUASIMODO
THE GYPSY HE EXCLAIMED ALMOST FRIGHTENED
LOOK HERE DO YOU COME
FROM THE OTHER WORLD
AND HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS DAGGER
QUICK QUICK SAID THE DEAF MAN ENDEAVORING TO DRAG THE HORSE ALONG
THIS WAY
PHOEBUS DEALT HIM A VIGOROUS KICK IN THE BREAST
QUASIMODO'S EYE FLASHED
HE MADE A MOTION TO FLING HIMSELF ON THE
CAPTAIN
THEN HE DREW HIMSELF UP STIFFLY AND SAID
OH HOW HAPPY YOU ARE TO HAVE SOME ONE WHO LOVES YOU
HE EMPHASIZED THE WORDS SOME ONE AND LOOSING THE HORSE'S BRIDLE
BEGONE
PHOEBUS SPURRED ON IN ALL HASTE SWEARING
QUASIMODO WATCHED HIM
DISAPPEAR IN THE SHADES OF THE STREET
OH SAID THE POOR DEAF MAN IN A VERY LOW VOICE TO REFUSE THAT
HE RE ENTERED NOTRE DAME LIGHTED HIS LAMP AND CLIMBED TO THE TOWER
AGAIN
THE GYPSY WAS STILL IN THE SAME PLACE AS HE HAD SUPPOSED
SHE FLEW TO MEET HIM AS FAR OFF AS SHE COULD SEE HIM
ALONE SHE
CRIED CLASPING HER BEAUTIFUL HANDS SORROWFULLY
I COULD NOT FIND HIM SAID QUASIMODO COLDLY
YOU SHOULD HAVE WAITED ALL NIGHT SHE SAID ANGRILY
HE SAW HER GESTURE OF WRATH AND UNDERSTOOD THE REPROACH
I WILL LIE IN WAIT FOR HIM BETTER ANOTHER TIME HE SAID DROPPING HIS
HEAD
BEGONE SHE SAID TO HIM
HE LEFT HER
SHE WAS DISPLEASED WITH HIM
HE PREFERRED TO HAVE HER
ABUSE HIM RATHER THAN TO HAVE AFFLICTED HER
HE HAD KEPT ALL THE PAIN TO
HIMSELF
FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE GYPSY NO LONGER SAW HIM
HE CEASED TO COME TO
HER CELL
AT THE MOST SHE OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE AT THE SUMMIT OF
THE TOWERS OF THE BELLRINGER'S FACE TURNED SADLY TO HER
BUT AS SOON AS
SHE PERCEIVED HIM HE DISAPPEARED
WE MUST ADMIT THAT SHE WAS NOT MUCH GRIEVED BY THIS VOLUNTARY ABSENCE
ON THE PART OF THE POOR HUNCHBACK
AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART SHE WAS
GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR IT
MOREOVER QUASIMODO DID NOT DECEIVE HIMSELF ON
THIS POINT
SHE NO LONGER SAW HIM BUT SHE FELT THE PRESENCE OF A GOOD GENIUS ABOUT
HER
HER PROVISIONS WERE REPLENISHED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND DURING HER
SLUMBERS
ONE MORNING SHE FOUND A CAGE OF BIRDS ON HER WINDOW
THERE
WAS A PIECE OF SCULPTURE ABOVE HER WINDOW WHICH FRIGHTENED HER
SHE HAD
SHOWN THIS MORE THAN ONCE IN QUASIMODO'S PRESENCE
ONE MORNING FOR
ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED AT NIGHT SHE NO LONGER SAW IT IT HAD BEEN
BROKEN
THE PERSON WHO HAD CLIMBED UP TO THAT CARVING MUST HAVE RISKED
HIS LIFE
SOMETIMES IN THE EVENING SHE HEARD A VOICE CONCEALED BENEATH THE WIND
SCREEN OF THE BELL TOWER SINGING A SAD STRANGE SONG AS THOUGH TO LULL
HER TO SLEEP
THE LINES WERE UNRHYMED SUCH AS A DEAF PERSON CAN MAKE
NE REGARDE PAS LA FIGURE
JEUNE FILLE REGARDE LE COEUR
LE COEUR D'UN BEAU JEUNE HOMME EST SOUVENT DIFFORME
IL Y A DES COEURS OU L'AMOUR NE SE CONSERVE PAS
JEUNE FILLE LE SAPIN N'EST PAS BEAU
N'EST PAS BEAU COMME LE PEUPLIER
MAIS IL GARDE SON FEUILLAGE L'HIVER
HLAS A QUOI BON DIRE CELA
CE QUI N'EST PAS BEAU A TORT D'TRE
LA BEAUT N'AIME QUE LA BEAUT
AVRIL TOURNE LE DOS A JANVIER
LA BEAUT EST PARFAITE
LA BEAUT PEUT TOUT
LA BEAUT EST LA SEULE CHOSE QUI N'EXISTE PS A DEMI
LE CORBEAU NE VOLE QUE LE JOUR
LE HIBOU NE VOLE QUE LA NUIT
LE CYGNE VOLE LA NUIT ET LE JOUR
LOOK NOT AT THE FACE YOUNG GIRL LOOK AT THE HEART
THE
HEART OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN IS OFTEN DEFORMED
THERE ARE HEARTS IN
WHICH LOVE DOES NOT KEEP
YOUNG GIRL THE PINE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL IT IS
NOT BEAUTIFUL LIKE THE POPLAR BUT IT KEEPS ITS FOLIAGE IN WINTER
ALAS
WHAT IS THE USE OF SAYING THAT THAT WHICH IS NOT BEAUTIFUL HAS NO RIGHT
TO EXIST BEAUTY LOVES ONLY BEAUTY APRIL TURNS HER BACK ON JANUARY
BEAUTY IS PERFECT BEAUTY CAN DO ALL THINGS BEAUTY IS THE ONLY THING
WHICH DOES NOT EXIST BY HALVES
THE RAVEN FLIES ONLY BY DAY THE OWL
FLIES ONLY BY NIGHT THE SWAN FLIES BY DAY AND BY NIGHT
ONE MORNING ON AWAKING SHE SAW ON HER WINDOW TWO VASES FILLED WITH
FLOWERS
ONE WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY BRILLIANT BUT CRACKED VASE OF
GLASS
IT HAD ALLOWED THE WATER WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN FILLED TO ESCAPE
AND THE FLOWERS WHICH IT CONTAINED WERE WITHERED
THE OTHER WAS AN
EARTHENWARE POT COARSE AND COMMON BUT WHICH HAD PRESERVED ALL ITS
WATER AND ITS FLOWERS REMAINED FRESH AND CRIMSON
I KNOW NOT WHETHER IT WAS DONE INTENTIONALLY BUT LA ESMERALDA TOOK THE
FADED NOSEGAY AND WORE IT ALL DAY LONG UPON HER BREAST
THAT DAY SHE DID NOT HEAR THE VOICE SINGING IN THE TOWER
SHE TROUBLED HERSELF VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT
SHE PASSED HER DAYS IN
CARESSING DJALI IN WATCHING THE DOOR OF THE GONDELAURIER HOUSE IN
TALKING TO HERSELF ABOUT PHOEBUS AND IN CRUMBLING UP HER BREAD FOR THE
SWALLOWS
SHE HAD ENTIRELY CEASED TO SEE OR HEAR QUASIMODO
THE POOR BELLRINGER
SEEMED TO HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE CHURCH
ONE NIGHT NEVERTHELESS
WHEN SHE WAS NOT ASLEEP BUT WAS THINKING OF HER HANDSOME CAPTAIN SHE
HEARD SOMETHING BREATHING NEAR HER CELL
SHE ROSE IN ALARM AND SAW BY
THE LIGHT OF THE MOON A SHAPELESS MASS LYING ACROSS HER DOOR ON THE
OUTSIDE
IT WAS QUASIMODO ASLEEP THERE UPON THE STONES
CHAPTER V
THE KEY TO THE RED DOOR
IN THE MEANTIME PUBLIC MINOR HAD INFORMED THE ARCHDEACON OF THE
MIRACULOUS MANNER IN WHICH THE GYPSY HAD BEEN SAVED
WHEN HE LEARNED IT
HE KNEW NOT WHAT HIS SENSATIONS WERE
HE HAD RECONCILED HIMSELF TO LA
ESMERALDA'S DEATH
IN THAT MATTER HE WAS TRANQUIL HE HAD REACHED THE
BOTTOM OF PERSONAL SUFFERING
THE HUMAN HEART DORA CLAUDE HAD MEDITATED
UPON THESE MATTERS CAN CONTAIN ONLY A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF DESPAIR
WHEN THE SPONGE IS SATURATED THE SEA MAY PASS OVER IT WITHOUT CAUSING A
SINGLE DROP MORE TO ENTER IT
NOW WITH LA ESMERALDA DEAD THE SPONGE WAS SOAKED ALL WAS AT AN END ON
THIS EARTH FOR DOM CLAUDE
BUT TO FEEL THAT SHE WAS ALIVE AND PHOEBUS
ALSO MEANT THAT TORTURES SHOCKS ALTERNATIVES LIFE WERE BEGINNING
AGAIN
AND CLAUDE WAS WEARY OF ALL THIS
WHEN HE HEARD THIS NEWS HE SHUT HIMSELF IN HIS CELL IN THE CLOISTER
HE
APPEARED NEITHER AT THE MEETINGS OF THE CHAPTER NOR AT THE SERVICES
HE
CLOSED HIS DOOR AGAINST ALL EVEN AGAINST THE BISHOP
HE REMAINED THUS
IMMURED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS
HE WAS BELIEVED TO BE ILL
AND SO HE WAS IN
FACT
WHAT DID HE DO WHILE THUS SHUT UP WITH WHAT THOUGHTS WAS THE
UNFORTUNATE MAN CONTENDING WAS HE GIVING FINAL BATTLE TO HIS FORMIDABLE
PASSION WAS HE CONCOCTING A FINAL PLAN OF DEATH FOR HER AND OF
PERDITION FOR HIMSELF
HIS JEHAN HIS CHERISHED BROTHER HIS SPOILED CHILD CAME ONCE TO HIS
DOOR KNOCKED SWORE ENTREATED GAVE HIS NAME HALF A SCORE OF TIMES
CLAUDE DID NOT OPEN
HE PASSED WHOLE DAYS WITH HIS FACE CLOSE TO THE PANES OF HIS WINDOW
FROM THAT WINDOW SITUATED IN THE CLOISTER HE COULD SEE LA ESMERALDA'S
CHAMBER
HE OFTEN SAW HERSELF WITH HER GOAT SOMETIMES WITH QUASIMODO
HE REMARKED THE LITTLE ATTENTIONS OF THE UGLY DEAF MAN HIS OBEDIENCE
HIS DELICATE AND SUBMISSIVE WAYS WITH THE GYPSY
HE RECALLED FOR HE HAD
A GOOD MEMORY AND MEMORY IS THE TORMENTOR OF THE JEALOUS HE RECALLED
THE SINGULAR LOOK OF THE BELLRINGER BENT ON THE DANCER UPON A CERTAIN
EVENING
HE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT MOTIVE COULD HAVE IMPELLED QUASIMODO TO
SAVE HER
HE WAS THE WITNESS OF A THOUSAND LITTLE SCENES BETWEEN THE
GYPSY AND THE DEAF MAN THE PANTOMIME OF WHICH VIEWED FROM AFAR AND
COMMENTED ON BY HIS PASSION APPEARED VERY TENDER TO HIM
HE DISTRUSTED
THE CAPRICIOUSNESS OF WOMEN
THEN HE FELT A JEALOUSY WHICH HE COULD
NEVER HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE AWAKENING WITHIN HIM A JEALOUSY WHICH MADE
HIM REDDEN WITH SHAME AND INDIGNATION ONE MIGHT CONDONE THE CAPTAIN
BUT THIS ONE THIS THOUGHT UPSET HIM
HIS NIGHTS WERE FRIGHTFUL
AS SOON AS HE LEARNED THAT THE GYPSY WAS
ALIVE THE COLD IDEAS OF SPECTRE AND TOMB WHICH HAD PERSECUTED HIM FOR
A WHOLE DAY VANISHED AND THE FLESH RETURNED TO GOAD HIM
HE TURNED AND
TWISTED ON HIS COUCH AT THE THOUGHT THAT THE DARK SKINNED MAIDEN WAS SO
NEAR HIM
EVERY NIGHT HIS DELIRIOUS IMAGINATION REPRESENTED LA ESMERALDA TO HIM IN
ALL THE ATTITUDES WHICH HAD CAUSED HIS BLOOD TO BOIL MOST
HE BEHELD HER
OUTSTRETCHED UPON THE PONIARDED CAPTAIN HER EYES CLOSED HER BEAUTIFUL
BARE THROAT COVERED WITH PHOEBUS'S BLOOD AT THAT MOMENT OF BLISS WHEN
THE ARCHDEACON HAD IMPRINTED ON HER PALE LIPS THAT KISS WHOSE BURN THE
UNHAPPY GIRL THOUGH HALF DEAD HAD FELT
HE BEHELD HER AGAIN STRIPPED
BY THE SAVAGE HANDS OF THE TORTURERS ALLOWING THEM TO BARE AND TO
ENCLOSE IN THE BOOT WITH ITS IRON SCREW HER TINY FOOT HER DELICATE
ROUNDED LEG HER WHITE AND SUPPLE KNEE
AGAIN HE BEHELD THAT IVORY KNEE
WHICH ALONE REMAINED OUTSIDE OF TORTERUE'S HORRIBLE APPARATUS
LASTLY
HE PICTURED THE YOUNG GIRL IN HER SHIFT WITH THE ROPE ABOUT HER NECK
SHOULDERS BARE FEET BARE ALMOST NUDE AS HE HAD SEEN HER ON THAT LAST
DAY
THESE IMAGES OF VOLUPTUOUSNESS MADE HIM CLENCH HIS FISTS AND A
SHIVER RUN ALONG HIS SPINE
ONE NIGHT AMONG OTHERS THEY HEATED SO CRUELLY HIS VIRGIN AND PRIESTLY
BLOOD THAT HE BIT HIS PILLOW LEAPED FROM HIS BED FLUNG ON A SURPLICE
OVER HIS SHIRT AND LEFT HIS CELL LAMP IN HAND HALF NAKED WILD HIS
EYES AFLAME
HE KNEW WHERE TO FIND THE KEY TO THE RED DOOR WHICH CONNECTED THE
CLOISTER WITH THE CHURCH AND HE ALWAYS HAD ABOUT HIM AS THE READER
KNOWS THE KEY OF THE STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE TOWERS
CHAPTER VI
CONTINUATION OF THE KEY TO THE RED DOOR
THAT NIGHT LA ESMERALDA HAD FALLEN ASLEEP IN HER CELL FULL OF
OBLIVION OF HOPE AND OF SWEET THOUGHTS
SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN ASLEEP
FOR SOME TIME DREAMING AS ALWAYS OF PHOEBUS WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER
THAT SHE HEARD A NOISE NEAR HER
SHE SLEPT LIGHTLY AND UNEASILY THE
SLEEP OF A BIRD A MERE NOTHING WAKED HER
SHE OPENED HER EYES
THE
NIGHT WAS VERY DARK
NEVERTHELESS SHE SAW A FIGURE GAZING AT HER
THROUGH THE WINDOW A LAMP LIGHTED UP THIS APPARITION
THE MOMENT THAT
THE FIGURE SAW THAT LA ESMERALDA HAD PERCEIVED IT IT BLEW OUT THE
LAMP
BUT THE YOUNG GIRL HAD HAD TIME TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF IT HER EYES
CLOSED AGAIN WITH TERROR
OH SHE SAID IN A FAINT VOICE THE PRIEST
ALL HER PAST UNHAPPINESS CAME BACK TO HER LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING
SHE
FELL BACK ON HER BED CHILLED
A MOMENT LATER SHE FELT A TOUCH ALONG HER BODY WHICH MADE HER SHUDDER
SO THAT SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF UP IN A SITTING POSTURE WIDE AWAKE AND
FURIOUS
THE PRIEST HAD JUST SLIPPED IN BESIDE HER
HE ENCIRCLED HER WITH BOTH
ARMS
SHE TRIED TO SCREAM AND COULD NOT
BEGONE MONSTER BEGONE ASSASSIN SHE SAID IN A VOICE WHICH WAS LOW
AND TREMBLING WITH WRATH AND TERROR
MERCY MERCY MURMURED THE PRIEST PRESSING HIS LIPS TO HER SHOULDER
SHE SEIZED HIS BALD HEAD BY ITS REMNANT OF HAIR AND TRIED TO THRUST
ASIDE HIS KISSES AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN BITES
MERCY REPEATED THE UNFORTUNATE MAN
IF YOU BUT KNEW WHAT MY LOVE FOR
YOU IS 'TIS FIRE MELTED LEAD A THOUSAND DAGGERS IN MY HEART
SHE STOPPED HIS TWO ARMS WITH SUPERHUMAN FORCE
LET ME GO SHE SAID OR I WILL SPIT IN YOUR FACE
HE RELEASED HER
VILIFY ME STRIKE ME BE MALICIOUS DO WHAT YOU WILL
BUT HAVE MERCY LOVE ME
THEN SHE STRUCK HIM WITH THE FURY OF A CHILD
SHE MADE HER BEAUTIFUL
HANDS STIFF TO BRUISE HIS FACE
BEGONE DEMON
LOVE ME LOVE MEPITY CRIED THE POOR PRIEST RETURNING HER BLOWS WITH
CARESSES
ALL AT ONCE SHE FELT HIM STRONGER THAN HERSELF
THERE MUST BE AN END TO THIS HE SAID GNASHING HIS TEETH
SHE WAS CONQUERED PALPITATING IN HIS ARMS AND IN HIS POWER
SHE FELT A
WANTON HAND STRAYING OVER HER
SHE MADE A LAST EFFORT AND BEGAN TO CRY
HELP HELP A VAMPIRE A VAMPIRE
NOTHING CAME
DJALI ALONE WAS AWAKE AND BLEATING WITH ANGUISH
HUSH SAID THE PANTING PRIEST
ALL AT ONCE AS SHE STRUGGLED AND CRAWLED ON THE FLOOR THE GYPSY'S HAND
CAME IN CONTACT WITH SOMETHING COLD AND METAL LIC IT WAS QUASIMODO'S
WHISTLE
SHE SEIZED IT WITH A CONVULSIVE HOPE RAISED IT TO HER LIPS AND
BLEW WITH ALL THE STRENGTH THAT SHE HAD LEFT
THE WHISTLE GAVE A CLEAR
PIERCING SOUND
WHAT IS THAT SAID THE PRIEST
ALMOST AT THE SAME INSTANT HE FELT HIMSELF RAISED BY A VIGOROUS ARM
THE
CELL WAS DARK HE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH CLEARLY WHO IT WAS THAT HELD
HIM THUS BUT HE HEARD TEETH CHATTERING WITH RAGE AND THERE WAS JUST
SUFFICIENT LIGHT SCATTERED AMONG THE GLOOM TO ALLOW HIM TO SEE ABOVE HIS
HEAD THE BLADE OF A LARGE KNIFE
THE PRIEST FANCIED THAT HE PERCEIVED THE FORM OF QUASIMODO
HE ASSUMED
THAT IT COULD BE NO ONE BUT HE
HE REMEMBERED TO HAVE STUMBLED AS
HE ENTERED OVER A BUNDLE WHICH WAS STRETCHED ACROSS THE DOOR ON THE
OUTSIDE
BUT AS THE NEWCOMER DID NOT UTTER A WORD HE KNEW NOT WHAT
TO THINK
HE FLUNG HIMSELF ON THE ARM WHICH HELD THE KNIFE CRYING
QUASIMODO HE FORGOT AT THAT MOMENT OF DISTRESS THAT QUASIMODO WAS
DEAF
IN A TWINKLING THE PRIEST WAS OVERTHROWN AND A LEADEN KNEE RESTED ON
HIS BREAST
FROM THE ANGULAR IMPRINT OF THAT KNEE HE RECOGNIZED QUASIMODO BUT WHAT
WAS TO BE DONE HOW COULD HE MAKE THE OTHER RECOGNIZE HIM THE DARKNESS
RENDERED THE DEAF MAN BLIND
HE WAS LOST
THE YOUNG GIRL PITILESS AS AN ENRAGED TIGRESS DID NOT
INTERVENE TO SAVE HIM
THE KNIFE WAS APPROACHING HIS HEAD THE
MOMENT WAS CRITICAL
ALL AT ONCE HIS ADVERSARY SEEMED STRICKEN WITH
HESITATION
NO BLOOD ON HER HE SAID IN A DULL VOICE
IT WAS IN FACT QUASIMODO'S VOICE
THEN THE PRIEST FELT A LARGE HAND DRAGGING HIM FEET FIRST OUT OF THE
CELL IT WAS THERE THAT HE WAS TO DIE
FORTUNATELY FOR HIM THE MOON HAD
RISEN A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE
WHEN THEY HAD PASSED THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE CELL ITS PALE RAYS FELL
UPON THE PRIEST'S COUNTENANCE
QUASIMODO LOOKED HIM FULL IN THE FACE A
TREMBLING SEIZED HIM AND HE RELEASED THE PRIEST AND SHRANK BACK
THE GYPSY WHO HAD ADVANCED TO THE THRESHOLD OF HER CELL BEHELD
WITH SURPRISE THEIR ROLES ABRUPTLY CHANGED
IT WAS NOW THE PRIEST WHO
MENACED QUASIMODO WHO WAS THE SUPPLIANT
THE PRIEST WHO WAS OVERWHELMING THE DEAF MAN WITH GESTURES OF WRATH AND
REPROACH MADE THE LATTER A VIOLENT SIGN TO RETIRE
THE DEAF MAN DROPPED HIS HEAD THEN HE CAME AND KNELT AT THE GYPSY'S
DOOR MONSEIGNEUR HE SAID IN A GRAVE AND RESIGNED VOICE YOU SHALL
DO ALL THAT YOU PLEASE AFTERWARDS BUT KILL ME FIRST
SO SAYING HE PRESENTED HIS KNIFE TO THE PRIEST
THE PRIEST BESIDE
HIMSELF WAS ABOUT TO SEIZE IT
BUT THE YOUNG GIRL WAS QUICKER THAN BE
SHE WRENCHED THE KNIFE FROM QUASIMODO'S HANDS AND BURST INTO A FRANTIC
LAUGH APPROACH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST
SHE HELD THE BLADE HIGH
THE PRIEST REMAINED UNDECIDED
SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE STRUCK HIM
THEN SHE ADDED WITH A PITILESS EXPRESSION WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS ABOUT
TO PIERCE THE PRIEST'S HEART WITH THOUSANDS OF RED HOT IRONS
AH I KNOW THAT PHOEBUS IS NOT DEAD
THE PRIEST OVERTURNED QUASIMODO ON THE FLOOR WITH A KICK AND QUIVERING
WITH RAGE DARTED BACK UNDER THE VAULT OF THE STAIRCASE
WHEN HE WAS GONE QUASIMODO PICKED UP THE WHISTLE WHICH HAD JUST SAVED
THE GYPSY
IT WAS GETTING RUSTY HE SAID AS HE HANDED IT BACK TO HER THEN HE
LEFT HER ALONE
THE YOUNG GIRL DEEPLY AGITATED BY THIS VIOLENT SCENE FELL BACK
EXHAUSTED ON HER BED AND BEGAN TO SOB AND WEEP
HER HORIZON WAS
BECOMING GLOOMY ONCE MORE
THE PRIEST HAD GROPED HIS WAY BACK TO HIS CELL
IT WAS SETTLED
DOM CLAUDE WAS JEALOUS OF QUASIMODO
HE REPEATED WITH A THOUGHTFUL AIR HIS FATAL WORDS NO ONE SHALL HAVE
HER
BOOK TENTH
CHAPTER I
GRINGOIRE HAS MANY GOOD IDEAS IN SUCCESSION RUE DES
BERNARDINS
AS SOON AS PIERRE GRINGOIRE HAD SEEN HOW THIS WHOLE AFFAIR WAS
TURNING AND THAT THERE WOULD DECIDEDLY BE THE ROPE HANGING AND OTHER
DISAGREEABLE THINGS FOR THE PRINCIPAL PERSONAGES IN THIS COMEDY HE HAD
NOT CARED TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF WITH THE MATTER FURTHER
THE OUTCASTS
WITH WHOM HE HAD REMAINED REFLECTING THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS THE BEST
COMPANY IN PARIS THE OUTCASTS HAD CONTINUED TO INTEREST THEMSELVES IN
BEHALF OF THE GYPSY
HE HAD THOUGHT IT VERY SIMPLE ON THE PART OF
PEOPLE WHO HAD LIKE HERSELF NOTHING ELSE IN PROSPECT BUT CHARMOLUE AND
TORTERUE AND WHO UNLIKE HIMSELF DID NOT GALLOP THROUGH THE REGIONS
OF IMAGINATION BETWEEN THE WINGS OF PEGASUS
FROM THEIR REMARKS HE
HAD LEARNED THAT HIS WIFE OF THE BROKEN CROCK HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN
NOTRE DAME AND HE WAS VERY GLAD OF IT
BUT HE FELT NO TEMPTATION TO
GO AND SEE HER THERE
HE MEDITATED OCCASIONALLY ON THE LITTLE GOAT AND
THAT WAS ALL
MOREOVER HE WAS BUSY EXECUTING FEATS OF STRENGTH DURING
THE DAY FOR HIS LIVING AND AT NIGHT HE WAS ENGAGED IN COMPOSING A
MEMORIAL AGAINST THE BISHOP OF PARIS FOR HE REMEMBERED HAVING BEEN
DRENCHED BY THE WHEELS OF HIS MILLS AND HE CHERISHED A GRUDGE AGAINST
HIM FOR IT
HE ALSO OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH ANNOTATING THE FINE WORK OF
BAUDRY LE ROUGE BISHOP OF NOYON AND TOURNAY DE CUPA PETRARUM WHICH
HAD GIVEN HIM A VIOLENT PASSION FOR ARCHITECTURE AN INCLINATION WHICH
HAD REPLACED IN HIS HEART HIS PASSION FOR HERMETICISM OF WHICH IT WAS
MOREOVER ONLY A NATURAL COROLLARY SINCE THERE IS AN INTIMATE RELATION
BETWEEN HERMETICISM AND MASONRY
GRINGOIRE HAD PASSED FROM THE LOVE OF
AN IDEA TO THE LOVE OF THE FORM OF THAT IDEA
ONE DAY HE HAD HALTED NEAR SAINT GERMAIN L'AUXERROIS AT THE CORNER OF
A MANSION CALLED FOR L'EVQUE THE BISHOP'S TRIBUNAL WHICH STOOD
OPPOSITE ANOTHER CALLED FOR LE ROI THE KING'S TRIBUNAL
AT THIS
FOR L'EVQUE THERE WAS A CHARMING CHAPEL OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
WHOSE APSE WAS ON THE STREET
GRINGOIRE WAS DEVOUTLY EXAMINING ITS
EXTERIOR SCULPTURES
HE WAS IN ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS OF EGOTISTICAL
EXCLUSIVE SUPREME ENJOYMENT WHEN THE ARTIST BEHOLDS NOTHING IN THE
WORLD BUT ART AND THE WORLD IN ART
ALL AT ONCE HE FEELS A HAND LAID
GRAVELY ON HIS SHOULDER
HE TURNS ROUND
IT WAS HIS OLD FRIEND HIS
FORMER MASTER MONSIEUR THE ARCHDEACON
HE WAS STUPEFIED
IT WAS A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAD SEEN THE ARCHDEACON
AND DOM CLAUDE WAS ONE OF THOSE SOLEMN AND IMPASSIONED MEN A MEETING
WITH WHOM ALWAYS UPSETS THE EQUILIBRIUM OF A SCEPTICAL PHILOSOPHER
THE ARCHDEACON MAINTAINED SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES DURING WHICH
GRINGOIRE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE HIM
HE FOUND DOM CLAUDE GREATLY CHANGED
PALE AS A WINTER'S MORNING WITH HOLLOW EYES AND HAIR ALMOST WHITE
THE
PRIEST BROKE THE SILENCE AT LENGTH BY SAYING IN A TRANQUIL BUT GLACIAL
TONE
HOW DO YOU DO MASTER PIERRE
MY HEALTH REPLIED GRINGOIRE
EH EH ONE CAN SAY BOTH ONE THING AND
ANOTHER ON THAT SCORE
STILL IT IS GOOD ON THE WHOLE
I TAKE NOT TOO
MUCH OF ANYTHING
YOU KNOW MASTER THAT THE SECRET OF KEEPING WELL
ACCORDING TO HIPPOCRATES ID EST CIBI POTUS SOMNI VENUS OMNIA
MODERATA SINT
SO YOU HAVE NO CARE MASTER PIERRE RESUMED THE ARCHDEACON GAZING
INTENTLY AT GRINGOIRE
NONE I' FAITH
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW
YOU SEE MASTER
I AM EXAMINING THE CHISELLING OF THESE STONES AND THE
MANNER IN WHICH YONDER BAS RELIEF IS THROWN OUT
THE PRIEST BEGAN TO SMILE WITH THAT BITTER SMILE WHICH RAISES ONLY ONE
CORNER OF THE MOUTH
AND THAT AMUSES YOU
'TIS PARADISE EXCLAIMED GRINGOIRE
AND LEANING OVER THE SCULPTURES
WITH THE FASCINATED AIR OF A DEMONSTRATOR OF LIVING PHENOMENA DO
YOU NOT THINK FOR INSTANCE THAT YON METAMORPHOSIS IN BAS RELIEF IS
EXECUTED WITH MUCH ADROITNESS DELICACY AND PATIENCE OBSERVE THAT
SLENDER COLUMN
AROUND WHAT CAPITAL HAVE YOU SEEN FOLIAGE MORE TENDER
AND BETTER CARESSED BY THE CHISEL
HERE ARE THREE RAISED BOSSES OF
JEAN MAILLEVIN
THEY ARE NOT THE FINEST WORKS OF THIS GREAT MASTER
NEVERTHELESS THE NAIVETE THE SWEETNESS OF THE FACES THE GAYETY OF THE
ATTITUDES AND DRAPERIES AND THAT INEXPLICABLE CHARM WHICH IS MINGLED
WITH ALL THE DEFECTS RENDER THE LITTLE FIGURES VERY DIVERTING AND
DELICATE PERCHANCE EVEN TOO MUCH SO
YOU THINK THAT IT IS NOT
DIVERTING
YES CERTAINLY SAID THE PRIEST
AND IF YOU WERE TO SEE THE INTERIOR OF THE CHAPEL RESUMED THE POET
WITH HIS GARRULOUS ENTHUSIASM
CARVINGS EVERYWHERE
'TIS AS THICKLY
CLUSTERED AS THE HEAD OF A CABBAGE THE APSE IS OF A VERY DEVOUT AND SO
PECULIAR A FASHION THAT I HAVE NEVER BEHELD ANYTHING LIKE IT ELSEWHERE
DOM CLAUDE INTERRUPTED HIM
YOU ARE HAPPY THEN
GRINGOIRE REPLIED WARMLY
ON MY HONOR YES FIRST I LOVED WOMEN THEN ANIMALS
NOW I LOVE STONES
THEY ARE QUITE AS AMUSING AS WOMEN AND ANIMALS AND LESS TREACHEROUS
THE PRIEST LAID HIS HAND ON HIS BROW
IT WAS HIS HABITUAL GESTURE
REALLY
STAY SAID GRINGOIRE ONE HAS ONE'S PLEASURES HE TOOK THE ARM OF
THE PRIEST WHO LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY AND MADE HIM ENTER THE STAIRCASE
TURRET OF FOR L'EVQUE
HERE IS A STAIRCASE EVERY TIME THAT I SEE IT I
AM HAPPY
IT IS OF THE SIMPLEST AND RAREST MANNER OF STEPS IN PARIS
ALL
THE STEPS ARE BEVELLED UNDERNEATH
ITS BEAUTY AND SIMPLICITY CONSIST
IN THE INTERSPACING OF BOTH BEING A FOOT OR MORE WIDE WHICH ARE
INTERLACED INTERLOCKED FITTED TOGETHER ENCHAINED ENCHASED INTERLINED
ONE UPON ANOTHER AND BITE INTO EACH OTHER IN A MANNER THAT IS TRULY
FIRM AND GRACEFUL
AND YOU DESIRE NOTHING
NO
AND YOU REGRET NOTHING
NEITHER REGRET NOR DESIRE
I HAVE ARRANGED MY MODE OF LIFE
WHAT MEN ARRANGE SAID CLAUDE THINGS DISARRANGE
I AM A PYRRHONIAN PHILOSOPHER REPLIED GRINGOIRE AND I HOLD ALL
THINGS IN EQUILIBRIUM
AND HOW DO YOU EARN YOUR LIVING
I STILL MAKE EPICS AND TRAGEDIES NOW AND THEN BUT THAT WHICH BRINGS ME
IN MOST IS THE INDUSTRY WITH WHICH YOU ARE ACQUAINTED MASTER CARRYING
PYRAMIDS OF CHAIRS IN MY TEETH
THE TRADE IS BUT A ROUGH ONE FOR A PHILOSOPHER
'TIS STILL EQUILIBRIUM SAID GRINGOIRE
WHEN ONE HAS AN IDEA ONE
ENCOUNTERS IT IN EVERYTHING
I KNOW THAT REPLIED THE ARCHDEACON
AFTER A SILENCE THE PRIEST RESUMED
YOU ARE NEVERTHELESS TOLERABLY POOR
POOR YES UNHAPPY NO
AT THAT MOMENT A TRAMPLING OF HORSES WAS HEARD AND OUR TWO
INTERLOCUTORS BEHELD DEFILING AT THE END OF THE STREET A COMPANY OF THE
KING'S UNATTACHED ARCHERS THEIR LANCES BORNE HIGH AN OFFICER AT
THEIR HEAD
THE CAVALCADE WAS BRILLIANT AND ITS MARCH RESOUNDED ON THE
PAVEMENT
HOW YOU GAZE AT THAT OFFICER SAID GRINGOIRE TO THE ARCHDEACON
BECAUSE I THINK I RECOGNIZE HIM
WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM
I THINK SAID CLAUDE THAT HIS NAME IS PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS
PHOEBUS A CURIOUS NAME THERE IS ALSO A PHOEBUS COMTE DE FOIX
I
REMEMBER HAVING KNOWN A WENCH WHO SWORE ONLY BY THE NAME OF PHOEBUS
COME AWAY FROM HERE SAID THE PRIEST
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO
YOU
FROM THE MOMENT OF THAT TROOP'S PASSING SOME AGITATION HAD PIERCED
THROUGH THE ARCHDEACON'S GLACIAL ENVELOPE
HE WALKED ON
GRINGOIRE
FOLLOWED HIM BEING ACCUSTOMED TO OBEY HIM LIKE ALL WHO HAD ONCE
APPROACHED THAT MAN SO FULL OF ASCENDENCY
THEY REACHED IN SILENCE THE
RUE DES BERNARDINS WHICH WAS NEARLY DESERTED
HERE DOM CLAUDE PAUSED
WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY TO ME MASTER GRINGOIRE ASKED HIM
DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THE DRESS OF THOSE CAVALIERS WHOM WE HAVE JUST
SEEN IS FAR HANDSOMER THAN YOURS AND MINE
GRINGOIRE TOSSED HIS HEAD
I' FAITH I LOVE BETTER MY RED AND YELLOW JERKIN THAN THOSE SCALES
OF IRON AND STEEL
A FINE PLEASURE TO PRODUCE WHEN YOU WALK THE SAME
NOISE AS THE QUAY OF OLD IRON IN AN EARTHQUAKE
SO GRINGOIRE YOU HAVE NEVER CHERISHED ENVY FOR THOSE HANDSOME FELLOWS
IN THEIR MILITARY DOUBLETS
ENVY FOR WHAT MONSIEUR THE ARCHDEACON THEIR STRENGTH THEIR ARMOR
THEIR DISCIPLINE BETTER PHILOSOPHY AND INDEPENDENCE IN RAGS
I PREFER
TO BE THE HEAD OF A FLY RATHER THAN THE TAIL OF A LION
THAT IS SINGULAR SAID THE PRIEST DREAMILY
YET A HANDSOME UNIFORM IS
A BEAUTIFUL THING
GRINGOIRE PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS IN A PENSIVE MOOD QUITTED HIM TO GO
AND ADMIRE THE PORCH OF A NEIGHBORING HOUSE
HE CAME BACK CLAPPING HIS
HANDS
IF YOU WERE LESS ENGROSSED WITH THE FINE CLOTHES OF MEN OF WAR
MONSIEUR THE ARCHDEACON I WOULD ENTREAT YOU TO COME AND SEE THIS DOOR
I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE HOUSE OF THE SIEUR AUBRY HAD THE MOST SUPERB
ENTRANCE IN THE WORLD
PIERRE GRINGOIRE SAID THE ARCHDEACON WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THAT
LITTLE GYPSY DANCER
LA ESMERALDA YOU CHANGE THE CONVERSATION VERY ABRUPTLY
WAS SHE NOT YOUR WIFE
YES BY VIRTUE OF A BROKEN CROCK
WE WERE TO HAVE FOUR YEARS OF IT
BY
THE WAY ADDED GRINGOIRE LOOKING AT THE ARCHDEACON IN A HALF BANTERING
WAY ARE YOU STILL THINKING OF HER
AND YOU THINK OF HER NO LONGER
VERY LITTLE
I HAVE SO MANY THINGS
GOOD HEAVENS HOW PRETTY THAT
LITTLE GOAT WAS
HAD SHE NOT SAVED YOUR LIFE
'TIS TRUE PARDIEU
WELL WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER
I CANNOT TELL YOU
I BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE HANGED HER
YOU BELIEVE SO
I AM NOT SURE
WHEN I SAW THAT THEY WANTED TO HANG PEOPLE I RETIRED
FROM THE GAME
THAT IS ALL YOU KNOW OF IT
WAIT A BIT
I WAS TOLD THAT SHE HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN NOTRE DAME AND
THAT SHE WAS SAFE THERE AND I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT AND I HAVE NOT
BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE GOAT WAS SAVED WITH HER AND THAT IS
ALL I KNOW
I WILL TELL YOU MORE CRIED DOM CLAUDE AND HIS VOICE HITHERTO LOW
SLOW AND ALMOST INDISTINCT TURNED TO THUNDER
SHE HAS IN FACT TAKEN
REFUGE IN NOTRE DAME
BUT IN THREE DAYS JUSTICE WILL RECLAIM HER AND
SHE WILL BE HANGED ON THE GRVE
THERE IS A DECREE OF PARLIAMENT
THAT'S ANNOYING SAID GRINGOIRE
THE PRIEST IN AN INSTANT BECAME COLD AND CALM AGAIN
AND WHO THE DEVIL RESUMED THE POET HAS AMUSED HIMSELF WITH
SOLICITING A DECREE OF REINTEGRATION WHY COULDN'T THEY LEAVE PARLIAMENT
IN PEACE WHAT HARM DOES IT DO IF A POOR GIRL TAKES SHELTER UNDER THE
FLYING BUTTRESSES OF NOTRE DAME BESIDE THE SWALLOWS' NESTS
THERE ARE SATANS IN THIS WORLD REMARKED THE ARCHDEACON
'TIS DEVILISH BADLY DONE OBSERVED GRINGOIRE
THE ARCHDEACON RESUMED AFTER A SILENCE
SO SHE SAVED YOUR LIFE
AMONG MY GOOD FRIENDS THE OUTCASTS
A LITTLE MORE OR A LITTLE LESS AND
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANGED
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY FOR IT TO DAY
WOULD NOT YOU LIKE TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER
I ASK NOTHING BETTER DOM CLAUDE BUT WHAT IF I ENTANGLE MYSELF IN SOME
VILLANOUS AFFAIR
WHAT MATTERS IT
BAH WHAT MATTERS IT YOU ARE GOOD MASTER THAT YOU ARE I HAVE TWO
GREAT WORKS ALREADY BEGUN
THE PRIEST SMOTE HIS BROW
IN SPITE OF THE CALM WHICH HE AFFECTED A
VIOLENT GESTURE BETRAYED HIS INTERNAL CONVULSIONS FROM TIME TO TIME
HOW IS SHE TO BE SAVED
GRINGOIRE SAID TO HIM MASTER I WILL REPLY TO YOU IL PADELT WHICH
MEANS IN TURKISH 'GOD IS OUR HOPE
HOW IS SHE TO BE SAVED REPEATED CLAUDE DREAMILY
GRINGOIRE SMOTE HIS BROW IN HIS TURN
LISTEN MASTER
I HAVE IMAGINATION I WILL DEVISE EXPEDIENTS FOR YOU
WHAT IF ONE WERE TO ASK HER PARDON FROM THE KING
OF LOUIS XI A PARDON
WHY NOT
TO TAKE THE TIGER'S BONE FROM HIM
GRINGOIRE BEGAN TO SEEK FRESH EXPEDIENTS
WELL STAY SHALL I ADDRESS TO THE MIDWIVES A REQUEST ACCOMPANIED BY
THE DECLARATION THAT THE GIRL IS WITH CHILD
THIS MADE THE PRIEST'S HOLLOW EYE FLASH
WITH CHILD KNAVE DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THIS
GRINGOIRE WAS ALARMED BY HIS AIR
HE HASTENED TO SAY OH NO NOT I
OUR MARRIAGE WAS A REAL FORISMARITAGIUM
I STAYED OUTSIDE
BUT ONE
MIGHT OBTAIN A RESPITE ALL THE SAME
MADNESS INFAMY HOLD YOUR TONGUE
YOU DO WRONG TO GET ANGRY MUTTERED GRINGOIRE
ONE OBTAINS A RESPITE
THAT DOES NO HARM TO ANY ONE AND ALLOWS THE MIDWIVES WHO ARE POOR
WOMEN TO EARN FORTY DENIERS PARISIS
THE PRIEST WAS NOT LISTENING TO HIM
BUT SHE MUST LEAVE THAT PLACE NEVERTHELESS HE MURMURED THE DECREE
IS TO BE EXECUTED WITHIN THREE DAYS
MOREOVER THERE WILL BE NO DECREE
THAT QUASIMODO WOMEN HAVE VERY DEPRAVED TASTES HE RAISED HIS VOICE
MASTER PIERRE I HAVE REFLECTED WELL THERE IS BUT ONE MEANS OF SAFETY
FOR HER
WHAT I SEE NONE MYSELF
LISTEN MASTER PIERRE REMEMBER THAT YOU OWE YOUR LIFE TO HER
I WILL
TELL YOU MY IDEA FRANKLY
THE CHURCH IS WATCHED NIGHT AND DAY ONLY
THOSE ARE ALLOWED TO COME OUT WHO HAVE BEEN SEEN TO ENTER
HENCE
YOU CAN ENTER
YOU WILL COME
I WILL LEAD YOU TO HER
YOU WILL CHANGE
CLOTHES WITH HER
SHE WILL TAKE YOUR DOUBLET YOU WILL TAKE HER
PETTICOAT
SO FAR IT GOES WELL REMARKED THE PHILOSOPHER AND THEN
AND THEN SHE WILL GO FORTH IN YOUR GARMENTS YOU WILL REMAIN WITH
HERS
YOU WILL BE HANGED PERHAPS BUT SHE WILL BE SAVED
GRINGOIRE SCRATCHED HIS EAR WITH A VERY SERIOUS AIR
STAY SAID HE
THAT IS AN IDEA WHICH WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ME UNAIDED
AT DOM CLAUDE'S PROPOSITION THE OPEN AND BENIGN FACE OF THE POET HAD
ABRUPTLY CLOUDED OVER LIKE A SMILING ITALIAN LANDSCAPE WHEN AN UNLUCKY
SQUALL COMES UP AND DASHES A CLOUD ACROSS THE SUN
WELL GRINGOIRE WHAT SAY YOU TO THE MEANS
I SAY MASTER THAT I SHALL NOT BE HANGED PERCHANCE BUT THAT I SHALL
BE HANGED INDUBITABLY
THAT CONCERNS US NOT
THE DEUCE SAID GRINGOIRE
SHE HAS SAVED YOUR LIFE
'TIS A DEBT THAT YOU ARE DISCHARGING
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY OTHERS WHICH I DO NOT DISCHARGE
MASTER PIERRE IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
THE ARCHDEACON SPOKE IMPERIOUSLY
LISTEN DOM CLAUDE REPLIED THE POET IN UTTER CONSTERNATION
YOU CLING
TO THAT IDEA AND YOU ARE WRONG
I DO NOT SEE WHY I SHOULD GET MYSELF
HANGED IN SOME ONE ELSE'S PLACE
WHAT HAVE YOU THEN WHICH ATTACHES YOU SO STRONGLY TO LIFE
OH A THOUSAND REASONS
WHAT REASONS IF YOU PLEASE
WHAT THE AIR THE SKY THE MORNING THE EVENING THE MOONLIGHT MY
GOOD FRIENDS THE THIEVES OUR JEERS WITH THE OLD HAGS OF GO BETWEENS
THE FINE ARCHITECTURE OF PARIS TO STUDY THREE GREAT BOOKS TO MAKE ONE
OF THEM BEING AGAINST THE BISHOPS AND HIS MILLS AND HOW CAN I TELL ALL
ANAXAGORAS SAID THAT HE WAS IN THE WORLD TO ADMIRE THE SUN
AND THEN
FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT I HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF PASSING ALL MY DAYS
WITH A MAN OF GENIUS WHO IS MYSELF WHICH IS VERY AGREEABLE
A HEAD FIT FOR A MULE BELL MUTTERED THE ARCHDEACON
OH TELL ME WHO
PRESERVED FOR YOU THAT LIFE WHICH YOU RENDER SO CHARMING TO YOURSELF TO
WHOM DO YOU OWE IT THAT YOU BREATHE THAT AIR BEHOLD THAT SKY AND CAN
STILL AMUSE YOUR LARK'S MIND WITH YOUR WHIMSICAL NONSENSE AND MADNESS
WHERE WOULD YOU BE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER DO YOU THEN DESIRE THAT
SHE THROUGH WHOM YOU ARE ALIVE SHOULD DIE THAT SHE SHOULD DIE THAT
BEAUTIFUL SWEET ADORABLE CREATURE WHO IS NECESSARY TO THE LIGHT OF
THE WORLD AND MORE DIVINE THAN GOD WHILE YOU HALF WISE AND HALF FOOL
A VAIN SKETCH OF SOMETHING A SORT OF VEGETABLE WHICH THINKS THAT IT
WALKS AND THINKS THAT IT THINKS YOU WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE WITH THE
LIFE WHICH YOU HAVE STOLEN FROM HER AS USELESS AS A CANDLE IN BROAD
DAYLIGHT COME HAVE A LITTLE PITY GRINGOIRE BE GENEROUS IN YOUR TURN
IT WAS SHE WHO SET THE EXAMPLE
THE PRIEST WAS VEHEMENT
GRINGOIRE LISTENED TO HIM AT FIRST WITH AN
UNDECIDED AIR THEN HE BECAME TOUCHED AND WOUND UP WITH A GRIMACE WHICH
MADE HIS PALLID FACE RESEMBLE THAT OF A NEW BORN INFANT WITH AN ATTACK
OF THE COLIC
YOU ARE PATHETIC SAID HE WIPING AWAY A TEAR
WELL I WILL THINK
ABOUT IT
THAT'S A QUEER IDEA OF YOURS AFTER ALL HE CONTINUED AFTER
A PAUSE WHO KNOWS PERHAPS THEY WILL NOT HANG ME
HE WHO BECOMES
BETROTHED DOES NOT ALWAYS MARRY
WHEN THEY FIND ME IN THAT LITTLE
LODGING SO GROTESQUELY MUFFLED IN PETTICOAT AND COIF PERCHANCE THEY
WILL BURST WITH LAUGHTER
AND THEN IF THEY DO HANG ME WELL THE
HALTER IS AS GOOD A DEATH AS ANY
'TIS A DEATH WORTHY OF A SAGE WHO HAS
WAVERED ALL HIS LIFE A DEATH WHICH IS NEITHER FLESH NOR FISH LIKE THE
MIND OF A VERITABLE SCEPTIC A DEATH ALL STAMPED WITH PYRRHONISM AND
HESITATION WHICH HOLDS THE MIDDLE STATION BETWIXT HEAVEN AND EARTH
WHICH LEAVES YOU IN SUSPENSE
'TIS A PHILOSOPHER'S DEATH AND I WAS
DESTINED THERETO PERCHANCE
IT IS MAGNIFICENT TO DIE AS ONE HAS LIVED
THE PRIEST INTERRUPTED HIM IS IT AGREED
WHAT IS DEATH AFTER ALL PURSUED GRINGOIRE WITH EXALTATION
A
DISAGREEABLE MOMENT A TOLL GATE THE PASSAGE OF LITTLE TO NOTHINGNESS
SOME ONE HAVING ASKED CERCIDAS THE MEGALOPOLITAN IF HE WERE WILLING TO
DIE 'WHY NOT HE REPLIED 'FOR AFTER MY DEATH I SHALL SEE THOSE GREAT
MEN PYTHAGORAS AMONG THE PHILOSOPHERS HECATAEUS AMONG HISTORIANS
HOMER AMONG POETS OLYMPUS AMONG MUSICIANS
THE ARCHDEACON GAVE HIM HIS HAND IT IS SETTLED THEN YOU WILL COME
TO MORROW
THIS GESTURE RECALLED GRINGOIRE TO REALITY
AH I' FAITH NO HE SAID IN THE TONE OF A MAN JUST WAKING UP
BE
HANGED 'TIS TOO ABSURD
I WILL NOT
FAREWELL THEN AND THE ARCHDEACON ADDED BETWEEN HIS TEETH I'LL FIND
YOU AGAIN
I DO NOT WANT THAT DEVIL OF A MAN TO FIND ME THOUGHT GRINGOIRE AND
HE RAN AFTER DOM CLAUDE
STAY MONSIEUR THE ARCHDEACON NO ILL FEELING
BETWEEN OLD FRIENDS YOU TAKE AN INTEREST IN THAT GIRL MY WIFE I MEAN
AND 'TIS WELL
YOU HAVE DEVISED A SCHEME TO GET HER OUT OF NOTRE DAME
BUT YOUR WAY IS EXTREMELY DISAGREEABLE TO ME GRINGOIRE
IF I HAD ONLY
ANOTHER ONE MYSELF I BEG TO SAY THAT A LUMINOUS INSPIRATION HAS JUST
OCCURRED TO ME
IF I POSSESSED AN EXPEDIENT FOR EXTRICATING HER FROM
A DILEMMA WITHOUT COMPROMISING MY OWN NECK TO THE EXTENT OF A SINGLE
RUNNING KNOT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO IT WILL NOT THAT SUFFICE YOU IS IT
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD BE HANGED IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY BE
CONTENT
THE PRIEST TORE OUT THE BUTTONS OF HIS CASSOCK WITH IMPATIENCE STREAM
OF WORDS WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
YES RESUMED GRINGOIRE TALKING TO HIMSELF AND TOUCHING HIS NOSE WITH
HIS FOREFINGER IN SIGN OF MEDITATION THAT'S IT THE THIEVES ARE
BRAVE FELLOWS THE TRIBE OF EGYPT LOVE HER THEY WILL RISE AT THE
FIRST WORD NOTHING EASIER A SUDDEN STROKE UNDER COVER OF THE
DISORDER THEY WILL EASILY CARRY HER OFF BEGINNING TO MORROW EVENING
THEY WILL ASK NOTHING BETTER
THE PLAN SPEAK CRIED THE ARCHDEACON SHAKING HIM
GRINGOIRE TURNED MAJESTICALLY TOWARDS HIM LEAVE ME YOU SEE THAT I AM
COMPOSING HE MEDITATED FOR A FEW MOMENTS MORE THEN BEGAN TO CLAP HIS
HANDS OVER HIS THOUGHT CRYING ADMIRABLE SUCCESS IS SURE
THE PLAN REPEATED CLAUDE IN WRATH
GRINGOIRE WAS RADIANT
COME THAT I MAY TELL YOU THAT VERY SOFTLY
'TIS A TRULY GALLANT
COUNTER PLOT WHICH WILL EXTRICATE US ALL FROM THE MATTER
PARDIEU IT
MUST BE ADMITTED THAT I AM NO FOOL
HE BROKE OFF
OH BY THE WAY IS THE LITTLE GOAT WITH THE WENCH
YES
THE DEVIL TAKE YOU
THEY WOULD HAVE HANGED IT ALSO WOULD THEY NOT
WHAT IS THAT TO ME
YES THEY WOULD HAVE HANGED IT
THEY HANGED A SOW LAST MONTH
THE
HEADSMAN LOVETH THAT HE EATS THE BEAST AFTERWARDS
TAKE MY PRETTY
DJALI POOR LITTLE LAMB
MALEDICTION EXCLAIMED DOM CLAUDE
YOU ARE THE EXECUTIONER
WHAT
MEANS OF SAFETY HAVE YOU FOUND KNAVE MUST YOUR IDEA BE EXTRACTED WITH
THE FORCEPS
VERY FINE MASTER THIS IS IT
GRINGOIRE BENT HIS HEAD TO THE ARCHDEACON'S HEAD AND SPOKE TO HIM IN A
VERY LOW VOICE CASTING AN UNEASY GLANCE THE WHILE FROM ONE END TO THE
OTHER OF THE STREET THOUGH NO ONE WAS PASSING
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED
DOM CLAUDE TOOK HIS HAND AND SAID COLDLY 'TIS WELL
FAREWELL UNTIL
TO MORROW
UNTIL TO MORROW REPEATED GRINGOIRE
AND WHILE THE ARCHDEACON WAS
DISAPPEARING IN ONE DIRECTION HE SET OFF IN THE OTHER SAYING TO
HIMSELF IN A LOW VOICE HERE'S A GRAND AFFAIR MONSIEUR PIERRE
GRINGOIRE
NEVER MIND 'TIS NOT WRITTEN THAT BECAUSE ONE IS OF SMALL
ACCOUNT ONE SHOULD TAKE FRIGHT AT A GREAT ENTERPRISE
BITOU CARRIED A
GREAT BULL ON HIS SHOULDERS THE WATER WAGTAILS THE WARBLERS AND THE
BUNTINGS TRAVERSE THE OCEAN
CHAPTER II
TURN VAGABOND
ON RE ENTERING THE CLOISTER THE ARCHDEACON FOUND AT THE DOOR OF HIS
CELL HIS BROTHER JEHAN DU MOULIN WHO WAS WAITING FOR HIM AND WHO HAD
BEGUILED THE TEDIUM OF WAITING BY DRAWING ON THE WALL WITH A BIT OF
CHARCOAL A PROFILE OF HIS ELDER BROTHER ENRICHED WITH A MONSTROUS
NOSE
DOM CLAUDE HARDLY LOOKED AT HIS BROTHER HIS THOUGHTS WERE ELSEWHERE
THAT MERRY SCAMP'S FACE WHOSE BEAMING HAD SO OFTEN RESTORED SERENITY
TO THE PRIEST'S SOMBRE PHYSIOGNOMY WAS NOW POWERLESS TO MELT THE GLOOM
WHICH GREW MORE DENSE EVERY DAY OVER THAT CORRUPTED MEPHITIC AND
STAGNANT SOUL
BROTHER SAID JEHAN TIMIDLY I AM COME TO SEE YOU
THE ARCHDEACON DID NOT EVEN RAISE HIS EYES
WHAT THEN
BROTHER RESUMED THE HYPOCRITE YOU ARE SO GOOD TO ME AND YOU GIVE
ME SUCH WISE COUNSELS THAT I ALWAYS RETURN TO YOU
WHAT NEXT
ALAS BROTHER YOU WERE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN YOU SAID TO ME JEHAN
JEHAN CESSAT DOCTORUM DOCTRINA DISCIPULORUM DISCIPLINA
JEHAN
BE WISE JEHAN BE LEARNED JEHAN PASS NOT THE NIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE
COLLEGE WITHOUT LAWFUL OCCASION AND DUE LEAVE OF THE MASTER
CUDGEL
NOT THE PICARDS NOLI JOANNES VERBERARE PICARDOS
ROT NOT LIKE AN
UNLETTERED ASS QUASI ASINUS ILLITTERATUS ON THE STRAW SEATS OF THE
SCHOOL
JEHAN ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE PUNISHED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE
MASTER
JEHAN GO EVERY EVENING TO CHAPEL AND SING THERE AN ANTHEM
WITH VERSE AND ORISON TO MADAME THE GLORIOUS VIRGIN MARY ALAS WHAT
EXCELLENT ADVICE WAS THAT
AND THEN
BROTHER YOU BEHOLD A CULPRIT A CRIMINAL A WRETCH A LIBERTINE A MAN
OF ENORMITIES MY DEAR BROTHER JEHAN HATH MADE OF YOUR COUNSELS STRAW
AND DUNG TO TRAMPLE UNDER FOOT
I HAVE BEEN WELL CHASTISED FOR IT AND
GOD IS EXTRAORDINARILY JUST
AS LONG AS I HAD MONEY I FEASTED I LEAD A
MAD AND JOYOUS LIFE
OH HOW UGLY AND CRABBED BEHIND IS DEBAUCH WHICH
IS SO CHARMING IN FRONT NOW I HAVE NO LONGER A BLANK I HAVE SOLD MY
NAPERY MY SHIRT AND MY TOWELS NO MORE MERRY LIFE THE BEAUTIFUL CANDLE
IS EXTINGUISHED AND I HAVE HENCEFORTH ONLY A WRETCHED TALLOW DIP
WHICH SMOKES IN MY NOSE
THE WENCHES JEER AT ME
I DRINK WATER I AM
OVERWHELMED WITH REMORSE AND WITH CREDITORS
THE REST SAID THE ARCHDEACON
ALAS MY VERY DEAR BROTHER I SHOULD LIKE TO SETTLE DOWN TO A BETTER
LIFE
I COME TO YOU FULL OF CONTRITION I AM PENITENT
I MAKE MY
CONFESSION
I BEAT MY BREAST VIOLENTLY
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT IN WISHING
THAT I SHOULD SOME DAY BECOME A LICENTIATE AND SUB MONITOR IN THE
COLLEGE OF TORCHI
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT I FEEL A MAGNIFICENT VOCATION
FOR THAT PROFESSION
BUT I HAVE NO MORE INK AND I MUST BUY SOME I
HAVE NO MORE PAPER I HAVE NO MORE BOOKS AND I MUST BUY SOME
FOR THIS
PURPOSE I AM GREATLY IN NEED OF A LITTLE MONEY AND I COME TO YOU
BROTHER WITH MY HEART FULL OF CONTRITION
IS THAT ALL
YES SAID THE SCHOLAR
A LITTLE MONEY
I HAVE NONE
THEN THE SCHOLAR SAID WITH AN AIR WHICH WAS BOTH GRAVE AND RESOLUTE
WELL BROTHER I AM SORRY TO BE OBLIGED TO TELL YOU THAT VERY FINE
OFFERS AND PROPOSITIONS ARE BEING MADE TO ME IN ANOTHER QUARTER
YOU WILL NOT GIVE ME ANY MONEY NO
IN THAT CASE I SHALL BECOME A
PROFESSIONAL VAGABOND
AS HE UTTERED THESE MONSTROUS WORDS HE ASSUMED THE MIEN OF AJAX
EXPECTING TO SEE THE LIGHTNINGS DESCEND UPON HIS HEAD
THE ARCHDEACON SAID COLDLY TO HIM BECOME A VAGABOND
JEHAN MADE HIM A DEEP BOW AND DESCENDED THE CLOISTER STAIRS WHISTLING
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE WAS PASSING THROUGH THE COURTYARD OF THE CLOISTER
BENEATH HIS BROTHER'S WINDOW HE HEARD THAT WINDOW OPEN RAISED HIS EYES
AND BEHELD THE ARCHDEACON'S SEVERE HEAD EMERGE
GO TO THE DEVIL SAID DOM CLAUDE HERE IS THE LAST MONEY WHICH YOU
WILL GET FROM ME
AT THE SAME TIME THE PRIEST FLUNG JEHAN A PURSE WHICH GAVE THE SCHOLAR
A BIG BUMP ON THE FOREHEAD AND WITH WHICH JEHAN RETREATED BOTH VEXED
AND CONTENT LIKE A DOG WHO HAD BEEN STONED WITH MARROW BONES
CHAPTER III
LONG LIVE MIRTH
THE READER HAS PROBABLY NOT FORGOTTEN THAT A PART OF THE COUR DE
MIRACLES WAS ENCLOSED BY THE ANCIENT WALL WHICH SURROUNDED THE CITY A
GOODLY NUMBER OF WHOSE TOWERS HAD BEGUN EVEN AT THAT EPOCH TO FALL TO
RUIN
ONE OF THESE TOWERS HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO A PLEASURE RESORT BY
THE VAGABONDS
THERE WAS A DRAIN SHOP IN THE UNDERGROUND STORY AND THE
REST IN THE UPPER STORIES
THIS WAS THE MOST LIVELY AND CONSEQUENTLY
THE MOST HIDEOUS POINT OF THE WHOLE OUTCAST DEN
IT WAS A SORT OF
MONSTROUS HIVE WHICH BUZZED THERE NIGHT AND DAY
AT NIGHT WHEN THE
REMAINDER OF THE BEGGAR HORDE SLEPT WHEN THERE WAS NO LONGER A WINDOW
LIGHTED IN THE DINGY FAADES OF THE PLACE WHEN NOT A CRY WAS ANY LONGER
TO BE HEARD PROCEEDING FROM THOSE INNUMERABLE FAMILIES THOSE ANT HILLS
OF THIEVES OF WENCHES AND STOLEN OR BASTARD CHILDREN THE MERRY TOWER
WAS STILL RECOGNIZABLE BY THE NOISE WHICH IT MADE BY THE SCARLET LIGHT
WHICH FLASHING SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE AIR HOLES THE WINDOWS THE
FISSURES IN THE CRACKED WALLS ESCAPED SO TO SPEAK FROM ITS EVERY
PORE
THE CELLAR THEN WAS THE DRAM SHOP
THE DESCENT TO IT WAS THROUGH A
LOW DOOR AND BY A STAIRCASE AS STEEP AS A CLASSIC ALEXANDRINE
OVER THE
DOOR BY WAY OF A SIGN THERE HUNG A MARVELLOUS DAUB REPRESENTING NEW
SONS AND DEAD CHICKENS WITH THIS PUN BELOW AUX SONNEURS POUR LES
TRPASSS THE WRINGERS FOR THE DEAD
SOLS NEUFS POULETS TUS
ONE EVENING WHEN THE CURFEW WAS SOUNDING FROM ALL THE BELFRIES IN PARIS
THE SERGEANTS OF THE WATCH MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED HAD IT BEEN GRANTED TO
THEM TO ENTER THE FORMIDABLE COURT OF MIRACLES THAT MORE TUMULT THAN
USUAL WAS IN PROGRESS IN THE VAGABONDS' TAVERN THAT MORE DRINKING WAS
BEING DONE AND LOUDER SWEARING
OUTSIDE IN THE PLACE THERE WERE MANY
GROUPS CONVERSING IN LOW TONES AS WHEN SOME GREAT PLAN IS BEING FRAMED
AND HERE AND THERE A KNAVE CROUCHING DOWN ENGAGED IN SHARPENING A
VILLANOUS IRON BLADE ON A PAVING STONE
MEANWHILE IN THE TAVERN ITSELF WINE AND GAMING OFFERED SUCH A POWERFUL
DIVERSION TO THE IDEAS WHICH OCCUPIED THE VAGABONDS' LAIR THAT EVENING
THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO DIVINE FROM THE REMARKS OF THE
DRINKERS WHAT WAS THE MATTER IN HAND
THEY MERELY WORE A GAYER AIR THAN
WAS THEIR WONT AND SOME WEAPON COULD BE SEEN GLITTERING BETWEEN THE
LEGS OF EACH OF THEM A SICKLE AN AXE A BIG TWO EDGED SWORD OR THE
HOOK OF AN OLD HACKBUT
THE ROOM CIRCULAR IN FORM WAS VERY SPACIOUS BUT THE TABLES WERE
SO THICKLY SET AND THE DRINKERS SO NUMEROUS THAT ALL THAT THE TAVERN
CONTAINED MEN WOMEN BENCHES BEER JUGS ALL THAT WERE DRINKING ALL
THAT WERE SLEEPING ALL THAT WERE PLAYING THE WELL THE LAME SEEMED
PILED UP PELL MELL WITH AS MUCH ORDER AND HARMONY AS A HEAP OF OYSTER
SHELLS
THERE WERE A FEW TALLOW DIPS LIGHTED ON THE TABLES BUT THE REAL
LUMINARY OF THIS TAVERN THAT WHICH PLAYED THE PART IN THIS DRAM SHOP OF
THE CHANDELIER OF AN OPERA HOUSE WAS THE FIRE
THIS CELLAR WAS SO DAMP
THAT THE FIRE WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT EVEN IN MIDSUMMER AN IMMENSE
CHIMNEY WITH A SCULPTURED MANTEL ALL BRISTLING WITH HEAVY IRON ANDIRONS
AND COOKING UTENSILS WITH ONE OF THOSE HUGE FIRES OF MIXED WOOD AND
PEAT WHICH AT NIGHT IN VILLAGE STREETS MAKE THE REFLECTION OF FORGE
WINDOWS STAND OUT SO RED ON THE OPPOSITE WALLS
A BIG DOG GRAVELY SEATED
IN THE ASHES WAS TURNING A SPIT LOADED WITH MEAT BEFORE THE COALS
GREAT AS WAS THE CONFUSION AFTER THE FIRST GLANCE ONE COULD DISTINGUISH
IN THAT MULTITUDE THREE PRINCIPAL GROUPS WHICH THRONGED AROUND THREE
PERSONAGES ALREADY KNOWN TO THE READER
ONE OF THESE PERSONAGES
FANTASTICALLY ACCOUTRED IN MANY AN ORIENTAL RAG WAS MATHIAS HUNGADI
SPICALI DUKE OF EGYPT AND BOHEMIA
THE KNAVE WAS SEATED ON A TABLE WITH
HIS LEGS CROSSED AND IN A LOUD VOICE WAS BESTOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE OF
MAGIC BOTH BLACK AND WHITE ON MANY A GAPING FACE WHICH SURROUNDED HIM
ANOTHER RABBLE PRESSED CLOSE AROUND OUR OLD FRIEND THE VALIANT KING OF
THUNES ARMED TO THE TEETH
CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU WITH A VERY SERIOUS AIR
AND IN A LOW VOICE WAS REGULATING THE DISTRIBUTION OF AN ENORMOUS CASK
OF ARMS WHICH STOOD WIDE OPEN IN FRONT OF HIM AND FROM WHENCE POURED
OUT IN PROFUSION AXES SWORDS BASSINETS COATS OF MAIL BROADSWORDS
LANCE HEADS ARROWS AND VIRETONS LIKE APPLES AND GRAPES FROM A HORN
OF PLENTY
EVERY ONE TOOK SOMETHING FROM THE CASK ONE A MORION ANOTHER
A LONG STRAIGHT SWORD ANOTHER A DAGGER WITH A CROSS SHAPED HILT
THE
VERY CHILDREN WERE ARMING THEMSELVES AND THERE WERE EVEN CRIPPLES IN
BOWLS WHO IN ARMOR AND CUIRASS MADE THEIR WAY BETWEEN THE LEGS OF THE
DRINKERS LIKE GREAT BEETLES
AN ARROW WITH A PYRAMIDAL HEAD OF IRON AND COPPER SPIRAL
WINGS BY WHICH A ROTATORY MOTION WAS COMMUNICATED
FINALLY A THIRD AUDIENCE THE MOST NOISY THE MOST JOVIAL AND THE MOST
NUMEROUS ENCUMBERED BENCHES AND TABLES IN THE MIDST OF WHICH HARANGUED
AND SWORE A FLUTE LIKE VOICE WHICH ESCAPED FROM BENEATH A HEAVY ARMOR
COMPLETE FROM CASQUE TO SPURS
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD THUS SCREWED A
WHOLE OUTFIT UPON HIS BODY WAS SO HIDDEN BY HIS WARLIKE ACCOUTREMENTS
THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN OF HIS PERSON SAVE AN IMPERTINENT RED
SNUB NOSE A ROSY MOUTH AND BOLD EYES
HIS BELT WAS FULL OF DAGGERS AND
PONIARDS A HUGE SWORD ON HIS HIP A RUSTED CROSS BOW AT HIS LEFT AND A
VAST JUG OF WINE IN FRONT OF HIM WITHOUT RECKONING ON HIS RIGHT A FAT
WENCH WITH HER BOSOM UNCOVERED
ALL MOUTHS AROUND HIM WERE LAUGHING
CURSING AND DRINKING
ADD TWENTY SECONDARY GROUPS THE WAITERS MALE AND FEMALE RUNNING WITH
JUGS ON THEIR HEADS GAMBLERS SQUATTING OVER TAWS MERELLES DICE
VACHETTES THE ARDENT GAME OF TRINGLET QUARRELS IN ONE CORNER KISSES
IN ANOTHER AND THE READER WILL HAVE SOME IDEA OF THIS WHOLE PICTURE
OVER WHICH FLICKERED THE LIGHT OF A GREAT FLAMING FIRE WHICH MADE A
THOUSAND HUGE AND GROTESQUE SHADOWS DANCE OVER THE WALLS OF THE DRINKING
SHOP
A GAME PLAYED ON A CHECKER BOARD CONTAINING THREE CONCENTRIC
SETS OF SQUARES WITH SMALL STONES
THE GAME CONSISTED IN GETTING THREE
STONES IN A ROW
AS FOR THE NOISE IT WAS LIKE THE INSIDE OF A BELL AT FULL PEAL
THE DRIPPING PAN WHERE CRACKLED A RAIN OF GREASE FILLED WITH ITS
CONTINUAL SPUTTERING THE INTERVALS OF THESE THOUSAND DIALOGUES WHICH
INTERMINGLED FROM ONE END OF THE APARTMENT TO THE OTHER
IN THE MIDST OF THIS UPROAR AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE TAVERN ON THE
BENCH INSIDE THE CHIMNEY SAT A PHILOSOPHER MEDITATING WITH HIS FEET IN
THE ASHES AND HIS EYES ON THE BRANDS
IT WAS PIERRE GRINGOIRE
BE QUICK MAKE HASTE ARM YOURSELVES WE SET OUT ON THE MARCH IN AN
HOUR SAID CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU TO HIS THIEVES
A WENCH WAS HUMMING
BONSOIR MON PRE ET MA MERE
LES DERNIERS COUVRENT LE FEU
GOOD NIGHT FATHER AND MOTHER THE LAST COVER UP THE FIRE
TWO CARD PLAYERS WERE DISPUTING
KNAVE CRIED THE REDDEST FACED OF THE TWO SHAKING HIS FIST AT THE
OTHER I'LL MARK YOU WITH THE CLUB
YOU CAN TAKE THE PLACE OF MISTIGRI
IN THE PACK OF CARDS OF MONSEIGNEUR THE KING
UGH ROARED A NORMAN RECOGNIZABLE BY HIS NASAL ACCENT WE ARE PACKED
IN HERE LIKE THE SAINTS OF CAILLOUVILLE
MY SONS THE DUKE OF EGYPT WAS SAYING TO HIS AUDIENCE IN A FALSETTO
VOICE SORCERESSES IN FRANCE GO TO THE WITCHES' SABBATH WITHOUT
BROOMSTICKS OR GREASE OR STEED MERELY BY MEANS OF SOME MAGIC WORDS
THE WITCHES OF ITALY ALWAYS HAVE A BUCK WAITING FOR THEM AT THEIR DOOR
ALL ARE BOUND TO GO OUT THROUGH THE CHIMNEY
THE VOICE OF THE YOUNG SCAMP ARMED FROM HEAD TO FOOT DOMINATED THE
UPROAR
HURRAH HURRAH HE WAS SHOUTING
MY FIRST DAY IN ARMOR OUTCAST I
AM AN OUTCAST
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK
MY FRIENDS MY NAME IS JEHAN
FROLLO DU MOULIN AND I AM A GENTLEMAN
MY OPINION IS THAT IF GOD WERE A
GENDARME HE WOULD TURN ROBBER
BROTHERS WE ARE ABOUT TO SET OUT ON
A FINE EXPEDITION
LAY SIEGE TO THE CHURCH BURST IN THE DOORS DRAG OUT
THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SAVE HER FROM THE JUDGES SAVE HER FROM THE PRIESTS
DISMANTLE THE CLOISTER BURN THE BISHOP IN HIS PALACE ALL THIS WE WILL
DO IN LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES FOR A BURGOMASTER TO EAT A SPOONFUL OF
SOUP
OUR CAUSE IS JUST WE WILL PLUNDER NOTRE DAME AND THAT WILL BE THE
END OF IT
WE WILL HANG QUASIMODO
DO YOU KNOW QUASIMODO LADIES
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM MAKE HIMSELF BREATHLESS ON THE BIG BELL ON A GRAND
PENTECOST FESTIVAL CORNE DU PRE 'TIS VERY FINE ONE WOULD SAY HE
WAS A DEVIL MOUNTED ON A MAN
LISTEN TO ME MY FRIENDS I AM A VAGABOND
TO THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART I AM A MEMBER OF THE SLANG THIEF GANG IN
MY SOUL I WAS BORN AN INDEPENDENT THIEF
I HAVE BEEN RICH AND I HAVE
DEVOURED ALL MY PROPERTY
MY MOTHER WANTED TO MAKE AN OFFICER OF ME MY
FATHER A SUB DEACON MY AUNT A COUNCILLOR OF INQUESTS MY GRANDMOTHER
PROTHONOTARY TO THE KING MY GREAT AUNT A TREASURER OF THE SHORT
ROBE AND I HAVE MADE MYSELF AN OUTCAST
I SAID THIS TO MY FATHER
WHO SPIT HIS CURSE IN MY FACE TO MY MOTHER WHO SET TO WEEPING AND
CHATTERING POOR OLD LADY LIKE YONDER FAGOT ON THE AND IRONS
LONG LIVE
MIRTH I AM A REAL BICTRE
WAITRESS MY DEAR MORE WINE
I HAVE STILL
THE WHEREWITHAL TO PAY
I WANT NO MORE SURNE WINE
IT DISTRESSES MY
THROAT
I'D AS LIEF CORBOEUF GARGLE MY THROAT WITH A BASKET
MEANWHILE THE RABBLE APPLAUDED WITH SHOUTS OF LAUGHTER AND SEEING THAT
THE TUMULT WAS INCREASING AROUND HIM THE SCHOLAR CRIED
OH WHAT A FINE NOISE POPULI DEBACCHANTIS POPULOSA DEBACCHATIO
THEN HE BEGAN TO SING HIS EYE SWIMMING IN ECSTASY IN THE TONE OF A
CANON INTONING VESPERS QU CANTICA QU ORGANA QU CANTILENOE
QU MELOCLIOE HIC SINE FINE DECANTANTUR SONANT MELLIFLUA HYMNORUM
ORGANA SUAVISSIMA ANGELORUM MELODIA CANTICA CANTICORUM MIRA HE BROKE
OFF TAVERN KEEPER OF THE DEVIL GIVE ME SOME SUPPER
THERE WAS A MOMENT OF PARTIAL SILENCE DURING WHICH THE SHARP VOICE OF
THE DUKE OF EGYPT ROSE AS HE GAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS BOHEMIANS
THE WEASEL IS CALLED ADRUNE THE FOX BLUE FOOT OR THE RACER OF THE
WOODS THE WOLF GRAY FOOT OR GOLD FOOT THE BEAR THE OLD MAN OR
GRANDFATHER
THE CAP OF A GNOME CONFERS INVISIBILITY AND CAUSES ONE TO
BEHOLD INVISIBLE THINGS
EVERY TOAD THAT IS BAPTIZED MUST BE CLAD IN RED
OR BLACK VELVET A BELL ON ITS NECK A BELL ON ITS FEET
THE GODFATHER
HOLDS ITS HEAD THE GODMOTHER ITS HINDER PARTS
'TIS THE DEMON
SIDRAGASUM WHO HATH THE POWER TO MAKE WENCHES DANCE STARK NAKED
BY THE MASS INTERRUPTED JEHAN I SHOULD LIKE TO BE THE DEMON
SIDRAGASUM
MEANWHILE THE VAGABONDS CONTINUED TO ARM THEMSELVES AND WHISPER AT THE
OTHER END OF THE DRAM SHOP
THAT POOR ESMERALDA SAID A BOHEMIAN
SHE IS OUR SISTER
SHE MUST BE
TAKEN AWAY FROM THERE
IS SHE STILL AT NOTRE DAME WENT ON A MERCHANT WITH THE APPEARANCE OF
A JEW

IN THE MEANTIME CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU HAD FINISHED THE DISTRIBUTION OF

HE APPROACHED GRINGOIRE WHO APPEARED TO BE PLUNGED IN A PROFOUND
REVERY WITH HIS FEET ON AN ANDIRON
FRIEND PIERRE SAID THE KING OF THUNES WHAT THE DEVIL ARE YOU

GRINGOIRE TURNED TO HIM WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE
I LOVE THE FIRE MY DEAR LORD

GRINGOIRE TORN FROM HIS MEDITATIONS BEGAN TO WATCH THE WILD AND NOISY
SCENE WHICH SURROUNDED HIM MUTTERING BETWEEN HIS TEETH LUXURIOSA
RES VINUM ET TUMULTUOSA EBRIETAS
ALAS WHAT GOOD REASON I HAVE NOT TO
DRINK AND HOW EXCELLENTLY SPOKE SAINT BENOIT VINUM APOSTATARE FACIT
ETIAM SAPIENTES
AT THAT MOMENT CLOPIN RETURNED AND SHOUTED IN A VOICE OF THUNDER
MIDNIGHT
AT THIS WORD WHICH PRODUCED THE EFFECT OF THE CALL TO BOOT AND SADDLE
ON A REGIMENT AT A HALT ALL THE OUTCASTS MEN WOMEN CHILDREN
RUSHED IN A MASS FROM THE TAVERN WITH GREAT NOISE OF ARMS AND OLD IRON
IMPLEMENTS
THE MOON WAS OBSCURED
THE COUR DES MIRACLES WAS ENTIRELY DARK
THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE LIGHT
ONE COULD MAKE OUT THERE A THRONG OF MEN AND WOMEN CONVERSING IN LOW
TONES
THEY COULD BE HEARD BUZZING AND A GLEAM OF ALL SORTS OF WEAPONS
WAS VISIBLE IN THE DARKNESS
CLOPIN MOUNTED A LARGE STONE
TO YOUR RANKS ARGOT HE CRIED
FALL INTO LINE EGYPT FORM RANKS
GALILEE
MEN OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF SLANG THIEVES
A MOVEMENT BEGAN IN THE DARKNESS
THE IMMENSE MULTITUDE APPEARED TO FORM
IN A COLUMN
AFTER A FEW MINUTES THE KING OF THUNES RAISED HIS VOICE
ONCE MORE
NOW SILENCE TO MARCH THROUGH PARIS THE PASSWORD IS 'LITTLE SWORD
IN POCKET THE TORCHES WILL NOT BE LIGHTED TILL WE REACH NOTRE DAME
FORWARD MARCH
TEN MINUTES LATER THE CAVALIERS OF THE WATCH FLED IN TERROR BEFORE A
LONG PROCESSION OF BLACK AND SILENT MEN WHICH WAS DESCENDING TOWARDS
THE PONT AN CHANGE THROUGH THE TORTUOUS STREETS WHICH PIERCE THE
CLOSE BUILT NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE MARKETS IN EVERY DIRECTION
CHAPTER IV
AN AWKWARD FRIEND
THAT NIGHT QUASIMODO DID NOT SLEEP
HE HAD JUST MADE HIS LAST ROUND OF
THE CHURCH
HE HAD NOT NOTICED THAT AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE WAS CLOSING
THE DOORS THE ARCHDEACON HAD PASSED CLOSE TO HIM AND BETRAYED SOME
DISPLEASURE ON SEEING HIM BOLTING AND BARRING WITH CARE THE ENORMOUS
IRON LOCKS WHICH GAVE TO THEIR LARGE LEAVES THE SOLIDITY OF A WALL
DOM
CLAUDE'S AIR WAS EVEN MORE PREOCCUPIED THAN USUAL
MOREOVER SINCE THE
NOCTURNAL ADVENTURE IN THE CELL HE HAD CONSTANTLY ABUSED QUASIMODO
BUT IN VAIN DID HE ILL TREAT AND EVEN BEAT HIM OCCASIONALLY NOTHING
DISTURBED THE SUBMISSION PATIENCE THE DEVOTED RESIGNATION OF
THE FAITHFUL BELLRINGER
HE ENDURED EVERYTHING ON THE PART OF THE
ARCHDEACON INSULTS THREATS BLOWS WITHOUT MURMURING A COMPLAINT
AT
THE MOST HE GAZED UNEASILY AFTER DOM CLAUDE WHEN THE LATTER ASCENDED
THE STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER BUT THE ARCHDEACON HAD ABSTAINED FROM
PRESENTING HIMSELF AGAIN BEFORE THE GYPSY'S EYES
ON THAT NIGHT ACCORDINGLY QUASIMODO AFTER HAVING CAST A GLANCE AT HIS
POOR BELLS WHICH HE SO NEGLECTED NOW JACQUELINE MARIE AND THIBAULD
MOUNTED TO THE SUMMIT OF THE NORTHERN TOWER AND THERE SETTING HIS DARK
LANTURN WELL CLOSED UPON THE LEADS HE BEGAN TO GAZE AT PARIS
THE
NIGHT AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID WAS VERY DARK
PARIS WHICH SO TO
SPEAK WAS NOT LIGHTED AT THAT EPOCH PRESENTED TO THE EYE A CONFUSED
COLLECTION OF BLACK MASSES CUT HERE AND THERE BY THE WHITISH CURVE OF
THE SEINE
QUASIMODO NO LONGER SAW ANY LIGHT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE
WINDOW IN A DISTANT EDIFICE WHOSE VAGUE AND SOMBRE PROFILE WAS OUTLINED
WELL ABOVE THE ROOFS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PORTE SAINTE ANTOINE
THERE ALSO THERE WAS SOME ONE AWAKE
AS THE ONLY EYE OF THE BELLRINGER PEERED INTO THAT HORIZON OF MIST AND
NIGHT HE FELT WITHIN HIM AN INEXPRESSIBLE UNEASINESS
FOR SEVERAL DAYS
HE HAD BEEN UPON HIS GUARD
HE HAD PERCEIVED MEN OF SINISTER MIEN WHO
NEVER TOOK THEIR EYES FROM THE YOUNG GIRL'S ASYLUM PROWLING CONSTANTLY
ABOUT THE CHURCH
HE FANCIED THAT SOME PLOT MIGHT BE IN PROCESS OF
FORMATION AGAINST THE UNHAPPY REFUGEE
HE IMAGINED THAT THERE EXISTED
A POPULAR HATRED AGAINST HER AS AGAINST HIMSELF AND THAT IT WAS VERY
POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN SOON
HENCE HE REMAINED UPON HIS
TOWER ON THE WATCH DREAMING IN HIS DREAM PLACE AS RABELAIS SAYS
WITH HIS EYE DIRECTED ALTERNATELY ON THE CELL AND ON PARIS KEEPING
FAITHFUL GUARD LIKE A GOOD DOG WITH A THOUSAND SUSPICIONS IN HIS MIND
ALL AT ONCE WHILE HE WAS SCRUTINIZING THE GREAT CITY WITH THAT EYE
WHICH NATURE BY A SORT OF COMPENSATION HAD MADE SO PIERCING THAT IT
COULD ALMOST SUPPLY THE OTHER ORGANS WHICH QUASIMODO LACKED IT
SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SINGULAR ABOUT THE QUAY DE LA
VIEILLE PELLETERIE THAT THERE WAS A MOVEMENT AT THAT POINT THAT THE
LINE OF THE PARAPET STANDING OUT BLACKLY AGAINST THE WHITENESS OF THE
WATER WAS NOT STRAIGHT AND TRANQUIL LIKE THAT OF THE OTHER QUAYS BUT
THAT IT UNDULATED TO THE EYE LIKE THE WAVES OF A RIVER OR LIKE THE
HEADS OF A CROWD IN MOTION
THIS STRUCK HIM AS STRANGE
HE REDOUBLED HIS ATTENTION
THE MOVEMENT
SEEMED TO BE ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CITY
THERE WAS NO LIGHT
IT LASTED
FOR SOME TIME ON THE QUAY THEN IT GRADUALLY CEASED AS THOUGH THAT
WHICH WAS PASSING WERE ENTERING THE INTERIOR OF THE ISLAND THEN
IT STOPPED ALTOGETHER AND THE LINE OF THE QUAY BECAME STRAIGHT AND
MOTIONLESS AGAIN
AT THE MOMENT WHEN QUASIMODO WAS LOST IN CONJECTURES IT SEEMED TO
HIM THAT THE MOVEMENT HAD RE APPEARED IN THE RUE DU PARVIS WHICH IS
PROLONGED INTO THE CITY PERPENDICULARLY TO THE FAADE OF NOTRE DAME
AT LENGTH DENSE AS WAS THE DARKNESS HE BEHELD THE HEAD OF A COLUMN
DEBOUCH FROM THAT STREET AND IN AN INSTANT A CROWD OF WHICH NOTHING
COULD BE DISTINGUISHED IN THE GLOOM EXCEPT THAT IT WAS A CROWD SPREAD
OVER THE PLACE
THIS SPECTACLE HAD A TERROR OF ITS OWN
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS
SINGULAR PROCESSION WHICH SEEMED SO DESIROUS OF CONCEALING ITSELF UNDER
PROFOUND DARKNESS MAINTAINED A SILENCE NO LESS PROFOUND
NEVERTHELESS
SOME NOISE MUST HAVE ESCAPED IT WERE IT ONLY A TRAMPLING
BUT THIS
NOISE DID NOT EVEN REACH OUR DEAF MAN AND THIS GREAT MULTITUDE OF
WHICH HE SAW HARDLY ANYTHING AND OF WHICH HE HEARD NOTHING THOUGH IT
WAS MARCHING AND MOVING SO NEAR HIM PRODUCED UPON HIM THE EFFECT OF A
RABBLE OF DEAD MEN MUTE IMPALPABLE LOST IN A SMOKE
IT SEEMED TO
HIM THAT HE BEHELD ADVANCING TOWARDS HIM A FOG OF MEN AND THAT HE SAW
SHADOWS MOVING IN THE SHADOW
THEN HIS FEARS RETURNED TO HIM THE IDEA OF AN ATTEMPT AGAINST THE GYPSY
PRESENTED ITSELF ONCE MORE TO HIS MIND
HE WAS CONSCIOUS IN A CONFUSED
WAY THAT A VIOLENT CRISIS WAS APPROACHING
AT THAT CRITICAL MOMENT HE
TOOK COUNSEL WITH HIMSELF WITH BETTER AND PROMPTER REASONING THAN ONE
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FROM SO BADLY ORGANIZED A BRAIN
OUGHT HE TO AWAKEN
THE GYPSY TO MAKE HER ESCAPE WHITHER THE STREETS WERE INVESTED THE
CHURCH BACKED ON THE RIVER
NO BOAT NO ISSUE THERE WAS BUT ONE
THING TO BE DONE TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE KILLED ON THE THRESHOLD OF
NOTRE DAME TO RESIST AT LEAST UNTIL SUCCOR ARRIVED IF IT SHOULD
ARRIVE AND NOT TO TROUBLE LA ESMERALDA'S SLEEP
THIS RESOLUTION ONCE
TAKEN HE SET TO EXAMINING THE ENEMY WITH MORE TRANQUILLITY
THE THRONG SEEMED TO INCREASE EVERY MOMENT IN THE CHURCH SQUARE
ONLY
HE PRESUMED THAT IT MUST BE MAKING VERY LITTLE NOISE SINCE THE WINDOWS
ON THE PLACE REMAINED CLOSED
ALL AT ONCE A FLAME FLASHED UP AND IN
AN INSTANT SEVEN OR EIGHT LIGHTED TORCHES PASSED OVER THE HEADS OF THE
CROWD SHAKING THEIR TUFTS OF FLAME IN THE DEEP SHADE
QUASIMODO THEN
BEHELD DISTINCTLY SURGING IN THE PARVIS A FRIGHTFUL HERD OF MEN AND
WOMEN IN RAGS ARMED WITH SCYTHES PIKES BILLHOOKS AND PARTISANS WHOSE
THOUSAND POINTS GLITTERED
HERE AND THERE BLACK PITCHFORKS FORMED HORNS
TO THE HIDEOUS FACES
HE VAGUELY RECALLED THIS POPULACE AND THOUGHT
THAT HE RECOGNIZED ALL THE HEADS WHO HAD SALUTED HIM AS POPE OF THE
FOOLS SOME MONTHS PREVIOUSLY
ONE MAN WHO HELD A TORCH IN ONE HAND AND
A CLUB IN THE OTHER MOUNTED A STONE POST AND SEEMED TO BE HARANGUING
THEM
AT THE SAME TIME THE STRANGE ARMY EXECUTED SEVERAL EVOLUTIONS AS
THOUGH IT WERE TAKING UP ITS POST AROUND THE CHURCH
QUASIMODO PICKED UP
HIS LANTERN AND DESCENDED TO THE PLATFORM BETWEEN THE TOWERS IN ORDER
TO GET A NEARER VIEW AND TO SPY OUT A MEANS OF DEFENCE
CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU ON ARRIVING IN FRONT OF THE LOFTY PORTAL OF
NOTRE DAME HAD IN FACT RANGED HIS TROOPS IN ORDER OF BATTLE
ALTHOUGH
HE EXPECTED NO RESISTANCE HE WISHED LIKE A PRUDENT GENERAL TO
PRESERVE AN ORDER WHICH WOULD PERMIT HIM TO FACE AT NEED A SUDDEN
ATTACK OF THE WATCH OR THE POLICE
HE HAD ACCORDINGLY STATIONED HIS
BRIGADE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT VIEWED FROM ABOVE AND FROM A DISTANCE
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED IT THE ROMAN TRIANGLE OF THE BATTLE OF
ECNOMUS THE BOAR'S HEAD OF ALEXANDER OR THE FAMOUS WEDGE OF GUSTAVUS
ADOLPHUS
THE BASE OF THIS TRIANGLE RESTED ON THE BACK OF THE PLACE IN
SUCH A MANNER AS TO BAR THE ENTRANCE OF THE RUE DU PARVIS ONE OF ITS
SIDES FACED HTEL DIEU THE OTHER THE RUE SAINT PIERRE AUX BOEUFS
CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU HAD PLACED HIMSELF AT THE APEX WITH THE DUKE OF
EGYPT OUR FRIEND JEHAN AND THE MOST DARING OF THE SCAVENGERS
AN ENTERPRISE LIKE THAT WHICH THE VAGABONDS WERE NOW UNDERTAKING AGAINST
NOTRE DAME WAS NOT A VERY RARE THING IN THE CITIES OF THE MIDDLE AGES
WHAT WE NOW CALL THE POLICE DID NOT EXIST THEN
IN POPULOUS CITIES
ESPECIALLY IN CAPITALS THERE EXISTED NO SINGLE CENTRAL REGULATING
POWER
FEUDALISM HAD CONSTRUCTED THESE GREAT COMMUNITIES IN A SINGULAR
MANNER
A CITY WAS AN ASSEMBLY OF A THOUSAND SEIGNEURIES WHICH
DIVIDED IT INTO COMPARTMENTS OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES
HENCE A THOUSAND
CONFLICTING ESTABLISHMENTS OF POLICE THAT IS TO SAY NO POLICE AT ALL
IN PARIS FOR EXAMPLE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE LORDS
WHO LAID CLAIM TO A MANOR THERE WERE FIVE AND TWENTY WHO LAID CLAIM TO
A MANOR AND TO ADMINISTERING JUSTICE FROM THE BISHOP OF PARIS WHO HAD
FIVE HUNDRED STREETS TO THE PRIOR OF NOTRE DAME DES CHAMPS WHO HAD
FOUR
ALL THESE FEUDAL JUSTICES RECOGNIZED THE SUZERAIN AUTHORITY OF THE
KING ONLY IN NAME
ALL POSSESSED THE RIGHT OF CONTROL OVER THE ROADS
ALL WERE AT HOME
LOUIS XI THAT INDEFATIGABLE WORKER WHO SO LARGELY
BEGAN THE DEMOLITION OF THE FEUDAL EDIFICE CONTINUED BY RICHELIEU AND
LOUIS XIV
FOR THE PROFIT OF ROYALTY AND FINISHED BY MIRABEAU FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE LOUIS XI
HAD CERTAINLY MADE AN EFFORT TO BREAK
THIS NETWORK OF SEIGNORIES WHICH COVERED PARIS BY THROWING VIOLENTLY
ACROSS THEM ALL TWO OR THREE TROOPS OF GENERAL POLICE
THUS IN 1465 AN
ORDER TO THE INHABITANTS TO LIGHT CANDLES IN THEIR WINDOWS AT NIGHTFALL
AND TO SHUT UP THEIR DOGS UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH IN THE SAME YEAR
AN ORDER TO CLOSE THE STREETS IN THE EVENING WITH IRON CHAINS AND A
PROHIBITION TO WEAR DAGGERS OR WEAPONS OF OFFENCE IN THE STREETS
AT NIGHT
BUT IN A VERY SHORT TIME ALL THESE EFFORTS AT COMMUNAL
LEGISLATION FELL INTO ABEYANCE
THE BOURGEOIS PERMITTED THE WIND TO
BLOW OUT THEIR CANDLES IN THE WINDOWS AND THEIR DOGS TO STRAY THE IRON
CHAINS WERE STRETCHED ONLY IN A STATE OF SIEGE THE PROHIBITION TO
WEAR DAGGERS WROUGHT NO OTHER CHANGES THAN FROM THE NAME OF THE RUE
COUPE GUEULE TO THE NAME OF THE RUE COUPE GORGE WHICH IS AN EVIDENT
PROGRESS
THE OLD SCAFFOLDING OF FEUDAL JURISDICTIONS REMAINED STANDING
AN IMMENSE AGGREGATION OF BAILIWICKS AND SEIGNORIES CROSSING EACH
OTHER ALL OVER THE CITY INTERFERING WITH EACH OTHER ENTANGLED IN ONE
ANOTHER ENMESHING EACH OTHER TRESPASSING ON EACH OTHER A USELESS
THICKET OF WATCHES SUB WATCHES AND COUNTER WATCHES OVER WHICH WITH
ARMED FORCE PASSED BRIGANDAGE RAPINE AND SEDITION
HENCE IN THIS
DISORDER DEEDS OF VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF THE POPULACE DIRECTED AGAINST
A PALACE A HOTEL OR HOUSE IN THE MOST THICKLY POPULATED QUARTERS WERE
NOT UNHEARD OF OCCURRENCES
IN THE MAJORITY OF SUCH CASES THE NEIGHBORS
DID NOT MEDDLE WITH THE MATTER UNLESS THE PILLAGING EXTENDED TO
THEMSELVES
THEY STOPPED UP THEIR EARS TO THE MUSKET SHOTS CLOSED THEIR
SHUTTERS BARRICADED THEIR DOORS ALLOWED THE MATTER TO BE CONCLUDED
WITH OR WITHOUT THE WATCH AND THE NEXT DAY IT WAS SAID IN PARIS
ETIENNE BARBETTE WAS BROKEN OPEN LAST NIGHT
THE MARSHAL DE CLERMONT
WAS SEIZED LAST NIGHT ETC HENCE NOT ONLY THE ROYAL HABITATIONS THE
LOUVRE THE PALACE THE BASTILLE THE TOURNELLES BUT SIMPLY SEIGNORIAL
RESIDENCES THE PETIT BOURBON THE HTEL DE SENS THE HTEL D'
ANGOULME ETC HAD BATTLEMENTS ON THEIR WALLS AND MACHICOLATIONS OVER
THEIR DOORS
CHURCHES WERE GUARDED BY THEIR SANCTITY
SOME AMONG THE
NUMBER NOTRE DAME WERE FORTIFIED
THE ABBEY OF SAINT GERMAN DES PRES
WAS CASTELLATED LIKE A BARONIAL MANSION AND MORE BRASS EXPENDED ABOUT
IT IN BOMBARDS THAN IN BELLS
ITS FORTRESS WAS STILL TO BE SEEN IN 1610
TO DAY BARELY ITS CHURCH REMAINS
CUT THROAT
COUPE GUEULE BEING THE VULGAR WORD FOR CUT WEAZAND
LET US RETURN TO NOTRE DAME
WHEN THE FIRST ARRANGEMENTS WERE COMPLETED AND WE MUST SAY TO THE
HONOR OF VAGABOND DISCIPLINE THAT CLOPIN'S ORDERS WERE EXECUTED IN
SILENCE AND WITH ADMIRABLE PRECISION THE WORTHY CHIEF OF THE BAND
MOUNTED ON THE PARAPET OF THE CHURCH SQUARE AND RAISED HIS HOARSE AND
SURLY VOICE TURNING TOWARDS NOTRE DAME AND BRANDISHING HIS TORCH WHOSE
LIGHT TOSSED BY THE WIND AND VEILED EVERY MOMENT BY ITS OWN SMOKE
MADE THE REDDISH FAADE OF THE CHURCH APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR BEFORE THE
EYE
TO YOU LOUIS DE BEAUMONT BISHOP OF PARIS COUNSELLOR IN THE COURT OF
PARLIAMENT I CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU KING OF THUNES GRAND COSRE PRINCE
OF ARGOT BISHOP OF FOOLS I SAY OUR SISTER FALSELY CONDEMNED FOR
MAGIC HATH TAKEN REFUGE IN YOUR CHURCH YOU OWE HER ASYLUM AND SAFETY
NOW THE COURT OF PARLIAMENT WISHES TO SEIZE HER ONCE MORE THERE AND YOU
CONSENT TO IT SO THAT SHE WOULD BE HANGED TO MORROW IN THE GRVE IF
GOD AND THE OUTCASTS WERE NOT HERE
IF YOUR CHURCH IS SACRED SO IS OUR
SISTER IF OUR SISTER IS NOT SACRED NEITHER IS YOUR CHURCH
THAT IS WHY
WE CALL UPON YOU TO RETURN THE GIRL IF YOU WISH TO SAVE YOUR CHURCH OR
WE WILL TAKE POSSESSION OF THE GIRL AGAIN AND PILLAGE THE CHURCH WHICH
WILL BE A GOOD THING
IN TOKEN OF WHICH I HERE PLANT MY BANNER AND MAY
GOD PRESERVE YOU BISHOP OF PARIS
QUASIMODO COULD NOT UNFORTUNATELY HEAR THESE WORDS UTTERED WITH A SORT
OF SOMBRE AND SAVAGE MAJESTY
A VAGABOND PRESENTED HIS BANNER TO CLOPIN
WHO PLANTED IT SOLEMNLY BETWEEN TWO PAVING STONES
IT WAS A PITCHFORK
FROM WHOSE POINTS HUNG A BLEEDING QUARTER OF CARRION MEAT
THAT DONE THE KING OF THUNES TURNED ROUND AND CAST HIS EYES OVER HIS
ARMY A FIERCE MULTITUDE WHOSE GLANCES FLASHED ALMOST EQUALLY WITH THEIR
PIKES
AFTER A MOMENTARY PAUSE FORWARD MY SONS HE CRIED TO WORK
LOCKSMITHS
THIRTY BOLD MEN SQUARE SHOULDERED AND WITH PICK LOCK FACES STEPPED
FROM THE RANKS WITH HAMMERS PINCERS AND BARS OF IRON ON THEIR
SHOULDERS
THEY BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THE PRINCIPAL DOOR OF THE CHURCH
ASCENDED THE STEPS AND WERE SOON TO BE SEEN SQUATTING UNDER THE ARCH
WORKING AT THE DOOR WITH PINCERS AND LEVERS A THRONG OF VAGABONDS
FOLLOWED THEM TO HELP OR LOOK ON
THE ELEVEN STEPS BEFORE THE PORTAL
WERE COVERED WITH THEM
BUT THE DOOR STOOD FIRM
THE DEVIL 'TIS HARD AND OBSTINATE SAID ONE
IT IS OLD AND ITS GRISTLES HAVE BECOME BONY SAID ANOTHER
COURAGE
COMRADES RESUMED CLOPIN
I WAGER MY HEAD AGAINST A DIPPER THAT YOU
WILL HAVE OPENED THE DOOR RESCUED THE GIRL AND DESPOILED THE CHIEF
ALTAR BEFORE A SINGLE BEADLE IS AWAKE
STAY I THINK I HEAR THE LOCK
BREAKING UP
CLOPIN WAS INTERRUPTED BY A FRIGHTFUL UPROAR WHICH RE SOUNDED BEHIND HIM
AT THAT MOMENT
HE WHEELED ROUND
AN ENORMOUS BEAM HAD JUST FALLEN FROM
ABOVE IT HAD CRUSHED A DOZEN VAGABONDS ON THE PAVEMENT WITH THE SOUND
OF A CANNON BREAKING IN ADDITION LEGS HERE AND THERE IN THE CROWD
OF BEGGARS WHO SPRANG ASIDE WITH CRIES OF TERROR
IN A TWINKLING THE
NARROW PRECINCTS OF THE CHURCH PARVIS WERE CLEARED
THE LOCKSMITHS
ALTHOUGH PROTECTED BY THE DEEP VAULTS OF THE PORTAL ABANDONED THE DOOR
AND CLOPIN HIMSELF RETIRED TO A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE FROM THE CHURCH
I HAD A NARROW ESCAPE CRIED JEHAN
I FELT THE WIND OF IT
TTE DE BOEUF BUT PIERRE THE SLAUGHTERER IS SLAUGHTERED
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE ASTONISHMENT MINGLED WITH FRIGHT WHICH
FELL UPON THE RUFFIANS IN COMPANY WITH THIS BEAM
THEY REMAINED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITH THEIR EYES IN THE AIR MORE
DISMAYED BY THAT PIECE OF WOOD THAN BY THE KING'S TWENTY THOUSAND
ARCHERS
SATAN MUTTERED THE DUKE OF EGYPT THIS SMACKS OF MAGIC
'TIS THE MOON WHICH THREW THIS LOG AT US SAID ANDRY THE RED
CALL THE MOON THE FRIEND OF THE VIRGIN AFTER THAT WENT ON FRANCOIS
CHANTEPRUNE
A THOUSAND POPES EXCLAIMED CLOPIN YOU ARE ALL FOOLS BUT HE DID
NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN THE FALL OF THE BEAM
MEANWHILE NOTHING COULD BE DISTINGUISHED ON THE FAADE TO WHOSE SUMMIT
THE LIGHT OF THE TORCHES DID NOT REACH
THE HEAVY BEAM LAY IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE ENCLOSURE AND GROANS WERE HEARD FROM THE POOR WRETCHES WHO HAD
RECEIVED ITS FIRST SHOCK AND WHO HAD BEEN ALMOST CUT IN TWAIN ON THE
ANGLE OF THE STONE STEPS
THE KING OF THUNES HIS FIRST AMAZEMENT PASSED FINALLY FOUND AN
EXPLANATION WHICH APPEARED PLAUSIBLE TO HIS COMPANIONS
THROAT OF GOD ARE THE CANONS DEFENDING THEMSELVES TO THE SACK THEN
TO THE SACK
TO THE SACK REPEATED THE RABBLE WITH A FURIOUS HURRAH
A DISCHARGE
OF CROSSBOWS AND HACKBUTS AGAINST THE FRONT OF THE CHURCH FOLLOWED
AT THIS DETONATION THE PEACEABLE INHABITANTS OF THE SURROUNDING HOUSES
WOKE UP MANY WINDOWS WERE SEEN TO OPEN AND NIGHTCAPS AND HANDS HOLDING
CANDLES APPEARED AT THE CASEMENTS
FIRE AT THE WINDOWS SHOUTED CLOPIN
THE WINDOWS WERE IMMEDIATELY
CLOSED AND THE POOR BOURGEOIS WHO HAD HARDLY HAD TIME TO CAST
A FRIGHTENED GLANCE ON THIS SCENE OF GLEAMS AND TUMULT RETURNED
PERSPIRING WITH FEAR TO THEIR WIVES ASKING THEMSELVES WHETHER THE
WITCHES' SABBATH WAS NOW BEING HELD IN THE PARVIS OF NOTRE DAME
OR WHETHER THERE WAS AN ASSAULT OF BURGUNDIANS AS IN '64
THEN THE
HUSBANDS THOUGHT OF THEFT THE WIVES OF RAPE AND ALL TREMBLED
TO THE SACK REPEATED THE THIEVES' CREW BUT THEY DARED NOT APPROACH
THEY STARED AT THE BEAM THEY STARED AT THE CHURCH
THE BEAM DID NOT
STIR THE EDIFICE PRESERVED ITS CALM AND DESERTED AIR BUT SOMETHING
CHILLED THE OUTCASTS
TO WORK LOCKSMITHS SHOUTED TROUILLEFOU
LET THE DOOR BE FORCED
NO ONE TOOK A STEP
BEARD AND BELLY SAID CLOPIN HERE BE MEN AFRAID OF A BEAM
AN OLD LOCKSMITH ADDRESSED HIM
CAPTAIN 'TIS NOT THE BEAM WHICH BOTHERS US 'TIS THE DOOR WHICH IS
ALL COVERED WITH IRON BARS
OUR PINCERS ARE POWERLESS AGAINST IT
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT TO BREAK IT IN DEMANDED CLOPIN
AH WE OUGHT TO HAVE A BATTERING RAM
THE KING OF THUNES RAN BOLDLY TO THE FORMIDABLE BEAM AND PLACED HIS
FOOT UPON IT HERE IS ONE HE EXCLAIMED 'TIS THE CANONS WHO SEND IT
TO YOU AND MAKING A MOCKING SALUTE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CHURCH
THANKS CANONS
THIS PIECE OF BRAVADO PRODUCED ITS EFFECTS THE SPELL OF THE BEAM WAS
BROKEN
THE VAGABONDS RECOVERED THEIR COURAGE SOON THE HEAVY JOIST
RAISED LIKE A FEATHER BY TWO HUNDRED VIGOROUS ARMS WAS FLUNG WITH FURY
AGAINST THE GREAT DOOR WHICH THEY HAD TRIED TO BATTER DOWN
AT THE SIGHT
OF THAT LONG BEAM IN THE HALF LIGHT WHICH THE INFREQUENT TORCHES OF
THE BRIGANDS SPREAD OVER THE PLACE THUS BORNE BY THAT CROWD OF MEN WHO
DASHED IT AT A RUN AGAINST THE CHURCH ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE
BEHELD A MONSTROUS BEAST WITH A THOUSAND FEET ATTACKING WITH LOWERED
HEAD THE GIANT OF STONE
AT THE SHOCK OF THE BEAM THE HALF METALLIC DOOR SOUNDED LIKE AN IMMENSE
DRUM IT WAS NOT BURST IN BUT THE WHOLE CATHEDRAL TREMBLED AND THE
DEEPEST CAVITIES OF THE EDIFICE WERE HEARD TO ECHO
AT THE SAME MOMENT A SHOWER OF LARGE STONES BEGAN TO FALL FROM THE TOP
OF THE FAADE ON THE ASSAILANTS
THE DEVIL CRIED JEHAN ARE THE TOWERS SHAKING THEIR BALUSTRADES DOWN
ON OUR HEADS
BUT THE IMPULSE HAD BEEN GIVEN THE KING OF THUNES HAD SET THE EXAMPLE
EVIDENTLY THE BISHOP WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF AND THEY ONLY BATTERED THE
DOOR WITH THE MORE RAGE IN SPITE OF THE STONES WHICH CRACKED SKULLS
RIGHT AND LEFT
IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT ALL THESE STONES FELL ONE BY ONE BUT THEY
FOLLOWED EACH OTHER CLOSELY
THE THIEVES ALWAYS FELT TWO AT A TIME ONE
ON THEIR LEGS AND ONE ON THEIR HEADS
THERE WERE FEW WHICH DID NOT
DEAL THEIR BLOW AND A LARGE LAYER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED LAY BLEEDING
AND PANTING BENEATH THE FEET OF THE ASSAILANTS WHO NOW GROWN FURIOUS
REPLACED EACH OTHER WITHOUT INTERMISSION
THE LONG BEAM CONTINUED TO
BELABOR THE DOOR AT REGULAR INTERVALS LIKE THE CLAPPER OF A BELL THE
STONES TO RAIN DOWN THE DOOR TO GROAN
THE READER HAS NO DOUBT DIVINED THAT THIS UNEXPECTED RESISTANCE WHICH
HAD EXASPERATED THE OUTCASTS CAME FROM QUASIMODO
CHANCE HAD UNFORTUNATELY FAVORED THE BRAVE DEAF MAN
WHEN HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE PLATFORM BETWEEN THE TOWERS HIS IDEAS WERE
ALL IN CONFUSION
HE HAD RUN UP AND DOWN ALONG THE GALLERY FOR SEVERAL
MINUTES LIKE A MADMAN SURVEYING FROM ABOVE THE COMPACT MASS OF
VAGABONDS READY TO HURL ITSELF ON THE CHURCH DEMANDING THE SAFETY OF
THE GYPSY FROM THE DEVIL OR FROM GOD
THE THOUGHT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM OF
ASCENDING TO THE SOUTHERN BELFRY AND SOUNDING THE ALARM BUT BEFORE
HE COULD HAVE SET THE BELL IN MOTION BEFORE MARIE'S VOICE COULD HAVE
UTTERED A SINGLE CLAMOR WAS THERE NOT TIME TO BURST IN THE DOOR OF THE
CHURCH TEN TIMES OVER IT WAS PRECISELY THE MOMENT WHEN THE LOCKSMITHS
WERE ADVANCING UPON IT WITH THEIR TOOLS
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
ALL AT ONCE HE REMEMBERED THAT SOME MASONS HAD BEEN AT WORK ALL DAY
REPAIRING THE WALL THE TIMBER WORK AND THE ROOF OF THE SOUTH TOWER
THIS WAS A FLASH OF LIGHT
THE WALL WAS OF STONE THE ROOF OF LEAD THE
TIMBER WORK OF WOOD
THAT PRODIGIOUS TIMBER WORK SO DENSE THAT IT WAS
CALLED THE FOREST
QUASIMODO HASTENED TO THAT TOWER
THE LOWER CHAMBERS WERE IN FACT FULL
OF MATERIALS
THERE WERE PILES OF ROUGH BLOCKS OF STONE SHEETS OF LEAD
IN ROLLS BUNDLES OF LATHS HEAVY BEAMS ALREADY NOTCHED WITH THE SAW
HEAPS OF PLASTER
TIME WAS PRESSING THE PIKES AND HAMMERS WERE AT WORK BELOW
WITH A
STRENGTH WHICH THE SENSE OF DANGER INCREASED TENFOLD HE SEIZED ONE
OF THE BEAMS THE LONGEST AND HEAVIEST HE PUSHED IT OUT THROUGH A
LOOPHOLE THEN GRASPING IT AGAIN OUTSIDE OF THE TOWER HE MADE IT SLIDE
ALONG THE ANGLE OF THE BALUSTRADE WHICH SURROUNDS THE PLATFORM AND
LET IT FLY INTO THE ABYSS
THE ENORMOUS TIMBER DURING THAT FALL OF A
HUNDRED AND SIXTY FEET SCRAPING THE WALL BREAKING THE CARVINGS TURNED
MANY TIMES ON ITS CENTRE LIKE THE ARM OF A WINDMILL FLYING OFF ALONE
THROUGH SPACE
AT LAST IT REACHED THE GROUND THE HORRIBLE CRY AROSE
AND THE BLACK BEAM AS IT REBOUNDED FROM THE PAVEMENT RESEMBLED A
SERPENT LEAPING
QUASIMODO BEHELD THE OUTCASTS SCATTER AT THE FALL OF THE BEAM LIKE
ASHES AT THE BREATH OF A CHILD
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEIR FRIGHT AND
WHILE THEY WERE FIXING A SUPERSTITIOUS GLANCE ON THE CLUB WHICH HAD
FALLEN FROM HEAVEN AND WHILE THEY WERE PUTTING OUT THE EYES OF THE
STONE SAINTS ON THE FRONT WITH A DISCHARGE OF ARROWS AND BUCKSHOT
QUASIMODO WAS SILENTLY PILING UP PLASTER STONES AND ROUGH BLOCKS OF
STONE EVEN THE SACKS OF TOOLS BELONGING TO THE MASONS ON THE EDGE OF
THE BALUSTRADE FROM WHICH THE BEAM HAD ALREADY BEEN HURLED
THUS AS SOON AS THEY BEGAN TO BATTER THE GRAND DOOR THE SHOWER OF
ROUGH BLOCKS OF STONE BEGAN TO FALL AND IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THE
CHURCH ITSELF WAS BEING DEMOLISHED OVER THEIR HEADS
ANY ONE WHO COULD HAVE BEHELD QUASIMODO AT THAT MOMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN
FRIGHTENED
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE PROJECTILES WHICH HE HAD PILED UPON THE
BALUSTRADE HE HAD COLLECTED A HEAP OF STONES ON THE PLATFORM ITSELF
AS
FAST AS THE BLOCKS ON THE EXTERIOR EDGE WERE EXHAUSTED HE DREW ON THE
HEAP
THEN HE STOOPED AND ROSE STOOPED AND ROSE AGAIN WITH INCREDIBLE
ACTIVITY
HIS HUGE GNOME'S HEAD BENT OVER THE BALUSTRADE THEN AN
ENORMOUS STONE FELL THEN ANOTHER THEN ANOTHER
FROM TIME TO TIME HE
FOLLOWED A FINE STONE WITH HIS EYE AND WHEN IT DID GOOD EXECUTION HE
SAID HUM
MEANWHILE THE BEGGARS DID NOT GROW DISCOURAGED
THE THICK DOOR ON WHICH
THEY WERE VENTING THEIR FURY HAD ALREADY TREMBLED MORE THAN TWENTY
TIMES BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF THEIR OAKEN BATTERING RAM MULTIPLIED BY THE
STRENGTH OF A HUNDRED MEN
THE PANELS CRACKED THE CARVED WORK FLEW INTO
SPLINTERS THE HINGES AT EVERY BLOW LEAPED FROM THEIR PINS THE PLANKS
YAWNED THE WOOD CRUMBLED TO POWDER GROUND BETWEEN THE IRON SHEATHING
FORTUNATELY FOR QUASIMODO THERE WAS MORE IRON THAN WOOD
NEVERTHELESS HE FELT THAT THE GREAT DOOR WAS YIELDING
ALTHOUGH HE DID
NOT HEAR IT EVERY BLOW OF THE RAM REVERBERATED SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE
VAULTS OF THE CHURCH AND WITHIN IT
FROM ABOVE HE BEHELD THE VAGABONDS
FILLED WITH TRIUMPH AND RAGE SHAKING THEIR FISTS AT THE GLOOMY FAADE
AND BOTH ON THE GYPSY'S ACCOUNT AND HIS OWN HE ENVIED THE WINGS OF THE
OWLS WHICH FLITTED AWAY ABOVE HIS HEAD IN FLOCKS
HIS SHOWER OF STONE BLOCKS WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REPEL THE ASSAILANTS
AT THIS MOMENT OF ANGUISH HE NOTICED A LITTLE LOWER DOWN THAN THE
BALUSTRADE WHENCE HE WAS CRUSHING THE THIEVES TWO LONG STONE GUTTERS
WHICH DISCHARGED IMMEDIATELY OVER THE GREAT DOOR THE INTERNAL ORIFICE
OF THESE GUTTERS TERMINATED ON THE PAVEMENT OF THE PLATFORM
AN IDEA
OCCURRED TO HIM HE RAN IN SEARCH OF A FAGOT IN HIS BELLRINGER'S DEN
PLACED ON THIS FAGOT A GREAT MANY BUNDLES OF LATHS AND MANY ROLLS OF
LEAD MUNITIONS WHICH HE HAD NOT EMPLOYED SO FAR AND HAVING ARRANGED
THIS PILE IN FRONT OF THE HOLE TO THE TWO GUTTERS HE SET IT ON FIRE
WITH HIS LANTERN
DURING THIS TIME SINCE THE STONES NO LONGER FELL THE OUTCASTS CEASED
TO GAZE INTO THE AIR
THE BANDITS PANTING LIKE A PACK OF HOUNDS WHO ARE
FORCING A BOAR INTO HIS LAIR PRESSED TUMULTUOUSLY ROUND THE GREAT
DOOR ALL DISFIGURED BY THE BATTERING RAM BUT STILL STANDING
THEY WERE
WAITING WITH A QUIVER FOR THE GREAT BLOW WHICH SHOULD SPLIT IT OPEN
THEY VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN PRESSING AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO
DASH AMONG THE FIRST WHEN IT SHOULD OPEN INTO THAT OPULENT CATHEDRAL
A VAST RESERVOIR WHERE THE WEALTH OF THREE CENTURIES HAD BEEN PILED UP
THEY REMINDED EACH OTHER WITH ROARS OF EXULTATION AND GREEDY LUST OF
THE BEAUTIFUL SILVER CROSSES THE FINE COPES OF BROCADE THE BEAUTIFUL
TOMBS OF SILVER GILT THE GREAT MAGNIFICENCES OF THE CHOIR THE
DAZZLING FESTIVALS THE CHRISTMASSES SPARKLING WITH TORCHES THE
EASTERS SPARKLING WITH SUNSHINE ALL THOSE SPLENDID SOLEMNETIES WHEREIN
CHANDELIERS CIBORIUMS TABERNACLES AND RELIQUARIES STUDDED THE ALTARS
WITH A CRUST OF GOLD AND DIAMONDS
CERTAINLY AT THAT FINE MOMENT
THIEVES AND PSEUDO SUFFERERS DOCTORS IN STEALING AND VAGABONDS WERE
THINKING MUCH LESS OF DELIVERING THE GYPSY THAN OF PILLAGING NOTRE DAME
WE COULD EVEN EASILY BELIEVE THAT FOR A GOODLY NUMBER AMONG THEM LA
ESMERALDA WAS ONLY A PRETEXT IF THIEVES NEEDED PRETEXTS
ALL AT ONCE AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE GROUPING THEMSELVES ROUND THE
RAM FOR A LAST EFFORT EACH ONE HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STIFFENING HIS
MUSCLES IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE ALL HIS FORCE TO THE DECISIVE BLOW A
HOWL MORE FRIGHTFUL STILL THAN THAT WHICH HAD BURST FORTH AND EXPIRED
BENEATH THE BEAM ROSE AMONG THEM
THOSE WHO DID NOT CRY OUT THOSE WHO
WERE STILL ALIVE LOOKED
TWO STREAMS OF MELTED LEAD WERE FALLING FROM
THE SUMMIT OF THE EDIFICE INTO THE THICKEST OF THE RABBLE
THAT SEA OF
MEN HAD JUST SUNK DOWN BENEATH THE BOILING METAL WHICH HAD MADE AT THE
TWO POINTS WHERE IT FELL TWO BLACK AND SMOKING HOLES IN THE CROWD SUCH
AS HOT WATER WOULD MAKE IN SNOW
DYING MEN HALF CONSUMED AND GROANING
WITH ANGUISH COULD BE SEEN WRITHING THERE
AROUND THESE TWO PRINCIPAL
STREAMS THERE WERE DROPS OF THAT HORRIBLE RAIN WHICH SCATTERED OVER THE
ASSAILANTS AND ENTERED THEIR SKULLS LIKE GIMLETS OF FIRE
IT WAS A HEAVY
FIRE WHICH OVERWHELMED THESE WRETCHES WITH A THOUSAND HAILSTONES
THE OUTCRY WAS HEARTRENDING
THEY FLED PELL MELL HURLING THE BEAM UPON
THE BODIES THE BOLDEST AS WELL AS THE MOST TIMID AND THE PARVIS WAS
CLEARED A SECOND TIME
ALL EYES WERE RAISED TO THE TOP OF THE CHURCH
THEY BEHELD THERE AN
EXTRAORDINARY SIGHT
ON THE CREST OF THE HIGHEST GALLERY HIGHER THAN
THE CENTRAL ROSE WINDOW THERE WAS A GREAT FLAME RISING BETWEEN THE TWO
TOWERS WITH WHIRLWINDS OF SPARKS A VAST DISORDERED AND FURIOUS FLAME
A TONGUE OF WHICH WAS BORNE INTO THE SMOKE BY THE WIND FROM TIME TO
TIME
BELOW THAT FIRE BELOW THE GLOOMY BALUSTRADE WITH ITS TREFOILS
SHOWING DARKLY AGAINST ITS GLARE TWO SPOUTS WITH MONSTER THROATS WERE
VOMITING FORTH UNCEASINGLY THAT BURNING RAIN WHOSE SILVERY STREAM STOOD
OUT AGAINST THE SHADOWS OF THE LOWER FAADE
AS THEY APPROACHED THE
EARTH THESE TWO JETS OF LIQUID LEAD SPREAD OUT IN SHEAVES LIKE WATER
SPRINGING FROM THE THOUSAND HOLES OF A WATERING POT
ABOVE THE FLAME
THE ENORMOUS TOWERS TWO SIDES OF EACH OF WHICH WERE VISIBLE IN SHARP
OUTLINE THE ONE WHOLLY BLACK THE OTHER WHOLLY RED SEEMED STILL MORE
VAST WITH ALL THE IMMENSITY OF THE SHADOW WHICH THEY CAST EVEN TO THE
SKY
THEIR INNUMERABLE SCULPTURES OF DEMONS AND DRAGONS ASSUMED A LUGUBRIOUS
ASPECT
THE RESTLESS LIGHT OF THE FLAME MADE THEM MOVE TO THE EYE
THERE
WERE GRIFFINS WHICH HAD THE AIR OF LAUGHING GARGOYLES WHICH ONE FANCIED
ONE HEARD YELPING SALAMANDERS WHICH PUFFED AT THE FIRE TARASQUES
WHICH SNEEZED IN THE SMOKE
AND AMONG THE MONSTERS THUS ROUSED FROM
THEIR SLEEP OF STONE BY THIS FLAME BY THIS NOISE THERE WAS ONE WHO
WALKED ABOUT AND WHO WAS SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME TO PASS ACROSS THE
GLOWING FACE OF THE PILE LIKE A BAT IN FRONT OF A CANDLE
THE REPRESENTATION OF A MONSTROUS ANIMAL SOLEMNLY DRAWN ABOUT
IN TARASCON AND OTHER FRENCH TOWNS
WITHOUT DOUBT THIS STRANGE BEACON LIGHT WOULD AWAKEN FAR AWAY THE
WOODCUTTER OF THE HILLS OF BICTRE TERRIFIED TO BEHOLD THE GIGANTIC
SHADOW OF THE TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME QUIVERING OVER HIS HEATHS
A TERRIFIED SILENCE ENSUED AMONG THE OUTCASTS DURING WHICH NOTHING WAS
HEARD BUT THE CRIES OF ALARM OF THE CANONS SHUT UP IN THEIR CLOISTER
AND MORE UNEASY THAN HORSES IN A BURNING STABLE THE FURTIVE SOUND
OF WINDOWS HASTILY OPENED AND STILL MORE HASTILY CLOSED THE INTERNAL
HURLY BURLY OF THE HOUSES AND OF THE HTEL DIEU THE WIND IN THE FLAME
THE LAST DEATH RATTLE OF THE DYING AND THE CONTINUED CRACKLING OF THE
RAIN OF LEAD UPON THE PAVEMENT
IN THE MEANWHILE THE PRINCIPAL VAGABONDS HAD RETIRED BENEATH THE PORCH
OF THE GONDELAURIER MANSION AND WERE HOLDING A COUNCIL OF WAR
THE DUKE OF EGYPT SEATED ON A STONE POST CONTEMPLATED THE
PHANTASMAGORICAL BONFIRE GLOWING AT A HEIGHT OF TWO HUNDRED FEET IN THE
AIR WITH RELIGIOUS TERROR
CLOPIN TROUILLEFOU BIT HIS HUGE FISTS WITH
RAGE
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IN HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
AN OLD ENCHANTED CHURCH GRUMBLED THE AGED BOHEMIAN MATHIAS HUNGADI
SPICALI
BY THE POPE'S WHISKERS WENT ON A SHAM SOLDIER WHO HAD ONCE BEEN IN
SERVICE HERE ARE CHURCH GUTTERS SPITTING MELTED LEAD AT YOU BETTER
THAN THE MACHICOLATIONS OF LECTOURE
DO YOU SEE THAT DEMON PASSING AND REPASSING IN FRONT OF THE FIRE
EXCLAIMED THE DUKE OF EGYPT
PARDIEU 'TIS THAT DAMNED BELLRINGER 'TIS QUASIMODO SAID CLOPIN
THE BOHEMIAN TOSSED HIS HEAD
I TELL YOU THAT 'TIS THE SPIRIT SABNAC
THE GRAND MARQUIS THE DEMON OF FORTIFICATIONS
HE HAS THE FORM OF AN
ARMED SOLDIER THE HEAD OF A LION
SOMETIMES HE RIDES A HIDEOUS HORSE
HE CHANGES MEN INTO STONES OF WHICH HE BUILDS TOWERS
HE COMMANDS
FIFTY LEGIONS 'TIS HE INDEED I RECOGNIZE HIM
SOMETIMES HE IS CLAD IN A
HANDSOME GOLDEN ROBE FIGURED AFTER THE TURKISH FASHION
WHERE IS BELLEVIGNE DE L'ETOILE DEMANDED CLOPIN
HE IS DEAD
ANDRY THE RED LAUGHED IN AN IDIOTIC WAY NOTRE DAME IS MAKING WORK FOR
THE HOSPITAL SAID HE
IS THERE THEN NO WAY OF FORCING THIS DOOR EXCLAIMED THE KING OF
THUNES STAMPING HIS FOOT
THE DUKE OF EGYPT POINTED SADLY TO THE TWO STREAMS OF BOILING LEAD WHICH
DID NOT CEASE TO STREAK THE BLACK FACADE LIKE TWO LONG DISTAFFS OF
PHOSPHORUS
CHURCHES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THUS ALL BY THEMSELVES
HE REMARKED WITH A SIGH
SAINT SOPHIA AT CONSTANTINOPLE FORTY YEARS
AGO HURLED TO THE EARTH THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION THE CRESCENT OF
MAHOM BY SHAKING HER DOMES WHICH ARE HER HEADS
GUILLAUME DE PARIS
WHO BUILT THIS ONE WAS A MAGICIAN
MUST WE THEN RETREAT IN PITIFUL FASHION LIKE HIGHWAYMEN SAID CLOPIN
MUST WE LEAVE OUR SISTER HERE WHOM THOSE HOODED WOLVES WILL HANG
TO MORROW
AND THE SACRISTY WHERE THERE ARE WAGON LOADS OF GOLD ADDED A
VAGABOND WHOSE NAME WE REGRET TO SAY WE DO NOT KNOW
BEARD OF MAHOM CRIED TROUILLEFOU
LET US MAKE ANOTHER TRIAL RESUMED THE VAGABOND
MATHIAS HUNGADI SHOOK HIS HEAD
WE SHALL NEVER GET IN BY THE DOOR
WE MUST FIND THE DEFECT IN THE ARMOR
OF THE OLD FAIRY A HOLE A FALSE POSTERN SOME JOINT OR OTHER
WHO WILL GO WITH ME SAID CLOPIN
I SHALL GO AT IT AGAIN
BY THE WAY
WHERE IS THE LITTLE SCHOLAR JEHAN WHO IS SO ENCASED IN IRON
HE IS DEAD NO DOUBT SOME ONE REPLIED WE NO LONGER HEAR HIS LAUGH
THE KING OF THUNES FROWNED SO MUCH THE WORSE
THERE WAS A BRAVE HEART
UNDER THAT IRONMONGERY
AND MASTER PIERRE GRINGOIRE
CAPTAIN CLOPIN SAID ANDRY THE RED HE SLIPPED AWAY BEFORE WE REACHED
THE PONT AUX CHANGEURS
CLOPIN STAMPED HIS FOOT
GUEULE DIEU 'TWAS HE WHO PUSHED US ON
HITHER AND HE HAS DESERTED US IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE JOB COWARDLY
CHATTERER WITH A SLIPPER FOR A HELMET
CAPTAIN CLOPIN SAID ANDRY THE RED WHO WAS GAZING DOWN RUE DU PARVIS
YONDER IS THE LITTLE SCHOLAR
PRAISED BE PLUTO SAID CLOPIN
BUT WHAT THE DEVIL IS HE DRAGGING
AFTER HIM
IT WAS IN FACT JEHAN WHO WAS RUNNING AS FAST AS HIS HEAVY OUTFIT OF A
PALADIN AND A LONG LADDER WHICH TRAILED ON THE PAVEMENT WOULD PERMIT
MORE BREATHLESS THAN AN ANT HARNESSED TO A BLADE OF GRASS TWENTY TIMES
LONGER THAN ITSELF
VICTORY TE DEUM CRIED THE SCHOLAR
HERE IS THE LADDER OF THE
LONGSHOREMEN OF PORT SAINT LANDRY
CLOPIN APPROACHED HIM
CHILD WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO CORNE DIEU WITH THIS LADDER
I HAVE IT REPLIED JEHAN PANTING
I KNEW WHERE IT WAS UNDER THE SHED
OF THE LIEUTENANT'S HOUSE
THERE'S A WENCH THERE WHOM I KNOW WHO THINKS
ME AS HANDSOME AS CUPIDO
I MADE USE OF HER TO GET THE LADDER AND I
HAVE THE LADDER PASQUE MAHOM THE POOR GIRL CAME TO OPEN THE DOOR TO
ME IN HER SHIFT
YES SAID CLOPIN BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT LADDER
JEHAN GAZED AT HIM WITH A MALICIOUS KNOWING LOOK AND CRACKED HIS
FINGERS LIKE CASTANETS
AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS SUBLIME
ON HIS HEAD HE
WORE ONE OF THOSE OVERLOADED HELMETS OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY WHICH
FRIGHTENED THE ENEMY WITH THEIR FANCIFUL CRESTS
HIS BRISTLED WITH TEN
IRON BEAKS SO THAT JEHAN COULD HAVE DISPUTED WITH NESTOR'S HOMERIC
VESSEL THE REDOUBTABLE TITLE OF DEXEUBOLOS
WHAT DO I MEAN TO DO WITH IT AUGUST KING OF THUNES DO YOU SEE THAT
ROW OF STATUES WHICH HAVE SUCH IDIOTIC EXPRESSIONS YONDER ABOVE THE
THREE PORTALS
YES
WELL
'TIS THE GALLERY OF THE KINGS OF FRANCE
WHAT IS THAT TO ME SAID CLOPIN
WAIT AT THE END OF THAT GALLERY THERE IS A DOOR WHICH IS NEVER
FASTENED OTHERWISE THAN WITH A LATCH AND WITH THIS LADDER I ASCEND AND
I AM IN THE CHURCH
CHILD LET ME BE THE FIRST TO ASCEND
NO COMRADE THE LADDER IS MINE
COME YOU SHALL BE THE SECOND
MAY BEELZEBUB STRANGLE YOU SAID SURLY CLOPIN I WON'T BE SECOND TO
ANYBODY
THEN FIND A LADDER CLOPIN
JEHAN SET OUT ON A RUN ACROSS THE PLACE DRAGGING HIS LADDER AND
SHOUTING FOLLOW ME LADS
IN AN INSTANT THE LADDER WAS RAISED AND PROPPED AGAINST THE BALUSTRADE
OF THE LOWER GALLERY ABOVE ONE OF THE LATERAL DOORS
THE THRONG OF
VAGABONDS UTTERING LOUD ACCLAMATIONS CROWDED TO ITS FOOT TO ASCEND
BUT JEHAN MAINTAINED HIS RIGHT AND WAS THE FIRST TO SET FOOT ON THE
RUNGS
THE PASSAGE WAS TOLERABLY LONG
THE GALLERY OF THE KINGS OF
FRANCE IS TO DAY ABOUT SIXTY FEET ABOVE THE PAVEMENT
THE ELEVEN STEPS
OF THE FLIGHT BEFORE THE DOOR MADE IT STILL HIGHER
JEHAN MOUNTED
SLOWLY A GOOD DEAL INCOMMODED BY HIS HEAVY ARMOR HOLDING HIS CROSSBOW
IN ONE HAND AND CLINGING TO A RUNG WITH THE OTHER
WHEN HE REACHED
THE MIDDLE OF THE LADDER HE CAST A MELANCHOLY GLANCE AT THE POOR DEAD
OUTCASTS WITH WHICH THE STEPS WERE STREWN
ALAS SAID HE HERE IS A
HEAP OF BODIES WORTHY OF THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD THEN HE CONTINUED
HIS ASCENT
THE VAGABONDS FOLLOWED HIM
THERE WAS ONE ON EVERY RUNG
AT THE SIGHT OF THIS LINE OF CUIRASSED BACKS UNDULATING AS THEY ROSE
THROUGH THE GLOOM ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED IT A SERPENT WITH STEEL
SCALES WHICH WAS RAISING ITSELF ERECT IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH
JEHAN WHO
FORMED THE HEAD AND WHO WAS WHISTLING COMPLETED THE ILLUSION
THE SCHOLAR FINALLY REACHED THE BALCONY OF THE GALLERY AND CLIMBED OVER
IT NIMBLY TO THE APPLAUSE OF THE WHOLE VAGABOND TRIBE
THUS MASTER OF
THE CITADEL HE UTTERED A SHOUT OF JOY AND SUDDENLY HALTED PETRIFIED
HE HAD JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF QUASIMODO CONCEALED IN THE DARK WITH
FLASHING EYE BEHIND ONE OF THE STATUES OF THE KINGS
BEFORE A SECOND ASSAILANT COULD GAIN A FOOTHOLD ON THE GALLERY THE
FORMIDABLE HUNCHBACK LEAPED TO THE HEAD OF THE LADDER WITHOUT UTTERING
A WORD SEIZED THE ENDS OF THE TWO UPRIGHTS WITH HIS POWERFUL HANDS
RAISED THEM PUSHED THEM OUT FROM THE WALL BALANCED THE LONG AND PLIANT
LADDER LOADED WITH VAGABONDS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM FOR A MOMENT IN THE
MIDST OF SHRIEKS OF ANGUISH THEN SUDDENLY WITH SUPERHUMAN FORCE
HURLED THIS CLUSTER OF MEN BACKWARD INTO THE PLACE
THERE WAS A MOMENT
WHEN EVEN THE MOST RESOLUTE TREMBLED
THE LADDER LAUNCHED BACKWARDS
REMAINED ERECT AND STANDING FOR AN INSTANT AND SEEMED TO HESITATE THEN
WAVERED THEN SUDDENLY DESCRIBING A FRIGHTFUL ARC OF A CIRCLE EIGHTY
FEET IN RADIUS CRASHED UPON THE PAVEMENT WITH ITS LOAD OF RUFFIANS
MORE RAPIDLY THAN A DRAWBRIDGE WHEN ITS CHAINS BREAK
THERE AROSE AN
IMMENSE IMPRECATION THEN ALL WAS STILL AND A FEW MUTILATED WRETCHES
WERE SEEN CRAWLING OVER THE HEAP OF DEAD
A SOUND OF WRATH AND GRIEF FOLLOWED THE FIRST CRIES OF TRIUMPH AMONG
THE BESIEGERS
QUASIMODO IMPASSIVE WITH BOTH ELBOWS PROPPED ON THE
BALUSTRADE LOOKED ON
HE HAD THE AIR OF AN OLD BUSHY HEADED KING AT
HIS WINDOW
AS FOR JEHAN FROLLO HE WAS IN A CRITICAL POSITION
HE FOUND HIMSELF IN
THE GALLERY WITH THE FORMIDABLE BELLRINGER ALONE SEPARATED FROM HIS
COMPANIONS BY A VERTICAL WALL EIGHTY FEET HIGH
WHILE QUASIMODO WAS
DEALING WITH THE LADDER THE SCHOLAR HAD RUN TO THE POSTERN WHICH HE
BELIEVED TO BE OPEN
IT WAS NOT
THE DEAF MAN HAD CLOSED IT BEHIND HIM
WHEN HE ENTERED THE GALLERY
JEHAN HAD THEN CONCEALED HIMSELF BEHIND
A STONE KING NOT DARING TO BREATHE AND FIXING UPON THE MONSTROUS
HUNCHBACK A FRIGHTENED GAZE LIKE THE MAN WHO WHEN COURTING THE WIFE
OF THE GUARDIAN OF A MENAGERIE WENT ONE EVENING TO A LOVE RENDEZVOUS
MISTOOK THE WALL WHICH HE WAS TO CLIMB AND SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF FACE
TO FACE WITH A WHITE BEAR
FOR THE FIRST FEW MOMENTS THE DEAF MAN PAID NO HEED TO HIM BUT AT LAST
HE TURNED HIS HEAD AND SUDDENLY STRAIGHTENED UP
HE HAD JUST CAUGHT
SIGHT OF THE SCHOLAR
JEHAN PREPARED HIMSELF FOR A ROUGH SHOCK BUT THE DEAF MAN REMAINED
MOTIONLESS ONLY HE HAD TURNED TOWARDS THE SCHOLAR AND WAS LOOKING AT
HIM
HO HO SAID JEHAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY STARING AT ME WITH THAT
SOLITARY AND MELANCHOLY EYE
AS HE SPOKE THUS THE YOUNG SCAMP STEALTHILY ADJUSTED HIS CROSSBOW
QUASIMODO HE CRIED I AM GOING TO CHANGE YOUR SURNAME YOU SHALL BE
CALLED THE BLIND MAN
THE SHOT SPED
THE FEATHERED VIRETON WHIZZED AND ENTERED THE
HUNCHBACK'S LEFT ARM
QUASIMODO APPEARED NO MORE MOVED BY IT THAN BY A
SCRATCH TO KING PHARAMOND
HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE ARROW TORE IT FROM
HIS ARM AND TRANQUILLY BROKE IT ACROSS HIS BIG KNEE THEN HE LET THE
TWO PIECES DROP ON THE FLOOR RATHER THAN THREW THEM DOWN
BUT JEHAN
HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO FIRE A SECOND TIME
THE ARROW BROKEN QUASIMODO
BREATHING HEAVILY BOUNDED LIKE A GRASSHOPPER AND HE FELL UPON THE
SCHOLAR WHOSE ARMOR WAS FLATTENED AGAINST THE WALL BY THE BLOW
AN ARROW WITH A PYRAMIDAL HEAD OF IRON AND COPPER SPIRAL WINGS BY
WHICH A ROTATORY MOTION WAS COMMUNICATED
THEN IN THAT GLOOM WHEREIN WAVERED THE LIGHT OF THE TORCHES A TERRIBLE
THING WAS SEEN
QUASIMODO HAD GRASPED WITH HIS LEFT HAND THE TWO ARMS OF JEHAN WHO DID
NOT OFFER ANY RESISTANCE SO THOROUGHLY DID HE FEEL THAT HE WAS LOST
WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE DEAF MAN DETACHED ONE BY ONE IN SILENCE WITH
SINISTER SLOWNESS ALL THE PIECES OF HIS ARMOR THE SWORD THE DAGGERS
THE HELMET THE CUIRASS THE LEG PIECES
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS
A MONKEY TAKING THE SHELL FROM A NUT
QUASIMODO FLUNG THE SCHOLAR'S
IRON SHELL AT HIS FEET PIECE BY PIECE
WHEN THE SCHOLAR BEHELD HIMSELF
DISARMED STRIPPED WEAK AND NAKED IN THOSE TERRIBLE HANDS HE MADE NO
ATTEMPT TO SPEAK TO THE DEAF MAN BUT BEGAN TO LAUGH AUDACIOUSLY IN HIS
FACE AND TO SING WITH HIS INTREPID HEEDLESSNESS OF A CHILD OF SIXTEEN
THE THEN POPULAR DITTY
ELLE EST BIEN HABILLE
LA VILLE DE CAMBRAI
MARAFIN L'A PILLE
THE CITY OF CAMBRAI IS WELL DRESSED
MARAFIN PLUNDERED IT
HE DID NOT FINISH
QUASIMODO WAS SEEN ON THE PARAPET OF THE GALLERY
HOLDING THE SCHOLAR BY THE FEET WITH ONE HAND AND WHIRLING HIM OVER
THE ABYSS LIKE A SLING THEN A SOUND LIKE THAT OF A BONY STRUCTURE IN
CONTACT WITH A WALL WAS HEARD AND SOMETHING WAS SEEN TO FALL WHICH
HALTED A THIRD OF THE WAY DOWN IN ITS FALL ON A PROJECTION IN THE
ARCHITECTURE
IT WAS A DEAD BODY WHICH REMAINED HANGING THERE BENT
DOUBLE ITS LOINS BROKEN ITS SKULL EMPTY
A CRY OF HORROR ROSE AMONG THE VAGABONDS
VENGEANCE SHOUTED CLOPIN
TO THE SACK REPLIED THE MULTITUDE
ASSAULT ASSAULT
THERE CAME A TREMENDOUS HOWL IN WHICH WERE MINGLED ALL TONGUES ALL
DIALECTS ALL ACCENTS
THE DEATH OF THE POOR SCHOLAR IMPARTED A FURIOUS
ARDOR TO THAT CROWD
IT WAS SEIZED WITH SHAME AND THE WRATH OF HAVING
BEEN HELD SO LONG IN CHECK BEFORE A CHURCH BY A HUNCHBACK
RAGE FOUND
LADDERS MULTIPLIED THE TORCHES AND AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW
MINUTES QUASIMODO IN DESPAIR BEHELD THAT TERRIBLE ANT HEAP MOUNT ON
ALL SIDES TO THE ASSAULT OF NOTRE DAME
THOSE WHO HAD NO LADDERS HAD
KNOTTED ROPES THOSE WHO HAD NO ROPES CLIMBED BY THE PROJECTIONS OF
THE CARVINGS
THEY HUNG FROM EACH OTHER'S RAGS
THERE WERE NO MEANS OF
RESISTING THAT RISING TIDE OF FRIGHTFUL FACES RAGE MADE THESE FIERCE
COUNTENANCES RUDDY THEIR CLAYEY BROWS WERE DRIPPING WITH SWEAT THEIR
EYES DARTED LIGHTNINGS ALL THESE GRIMACES ALL THESE HORRORS LAID SIEGE
TO QUASIMODO
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT SOME OTHER CHURCH HAD DESPATCHED
TO THE ASSAULT OF NOTRE DAME ITS GORGONS ITS DOGS ITS DRES ITS
DEMONS ITS MOST FANTASTIC SCULPTURES
IT WAS LIKE A LAYER OF LIVING
MONSTERS ON THE STONE MONSTERS OF THE FAADE
MEANWHILE THE PLACE WAS STUDDED WITH A THOUSAND TORCHES
THIS SCENE OF
CONFUSION TILL NOW HID IN DARKNESS WAS SUDDENLY FLOODED WITH LIGHT
THE PARVIS WAS RESPLENDENT AND CAST A RADIANCE ON THE SKY THE BONFIRE
LIGHTED ON THE LOFTY PLATFORM WAS STILL BURNING AND ILLUMINATED THE
CITY FAR AWAY
THE ENORMOUS SILHOUETTE OF THE TWO TOWERS PROJECTED AFAR
ON THE ROOFS OF PARIS AND FORMED A LARGE NOTCH OF BLACK IN THIS LIGHT
THE CITY SEEMED TO BE AROUSED
ALARM BELLS WAILED IN THE DISTANCE
THE VAGABONDS HOWLED PANTED SWORE CLIMBED AND QUASIMODO POWERLESS
AGAINST SO MANY ENEMIES SHUDDERING FOR THE GYPSY BEHOLDING THE FURIOUS
FACES APPROACHING EVER NEARER AND NEARER TO HIS GALLERY ENTREATED
HEAVEN FOR A MIRACLE AND WRUNG HIS ARMS IN DESPAIR
CHAPTER V
THE RETREAT IN WHICH MONSIEUR LOUIS OF FRANCE SAYS HIS
PRAYERS
THE READER HAS NOT PERHAPS FORGOTTEN THAT ONE MOMENT BEFORE CATCHING
SIGHT OF THE NOCTURNAL BAND OF VAGABONDS QUASIMODO AS HE INSPECTED
PARIS FROM THE HEIGHTS OF HIS BELL TOWER PERCEIVED ONLY ONE LIGHT
BURNING WHICH GLEAMED LIKE A STAR FROM A WINDOW ON THE TOPMOST STORY
OF A LOFTY EDIFICE BESIDE THE PORTE SAINT ANTOINE
THIS EDIFICE WAS THE
BASTILLE
THAT STAR WAS THE CANDLE OF LOUIS XI
KING LOUIS XI
HAD IN
FACT BEEN TWO DAYS IN PARIS
HE WAS TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE ON THE NEXT
DAY BUT ONE FOR HIS CITADEL OF MONTILZ LES TOURS
HE MADE BUT SELDOM AND
BRIEF APPEARANCE IN HIS GOOD CITY OF PARIS SINCE THERE HE DID NOT FEEL
ABOUT HIM ENOUGH PITFALLS GIBBETS AND SCOTCH ARCHERS
HE HAD COME THAT DAY TO SLEEP AT THE BASTILLE
THE GREAT CHAMBER FIVE
TOISES SQUARE WHICH HE HAD AT THE LOUVRE WITH ITS HUGE CHIMNEY PIECE
LOADED WITH TWELVE GREAT BEASTS AND THIRTEEN GREAT PROPHETS AND HIS
GRAND BED ELEVEN FEET BY TWELVE PLEASED HIM BUT LITTLE
HE FELT
HIMSELF LOST AMID ALL THIS GRANDEUR
THIS GOOD BOURGEOIS KING PREFERRED
THE BASTILLE WITH A TINY CHAMBER AND COUCH
AND THEN THE BASTILLE WAS
STRONGER THAN THE LOUVRE
AN ANCIENT LONG MEASURE IN FRANCE CONTAINING SIX FEET
AND NEARLY FIVE INCHES ENGLISH MEASURE
THIS LITTLE CHAMBER WHICH THE KING RESERVED FOR HIMSELF IN THE FAMOUS
STATE PRISON WAS ALSO TOLERABLY SPACIOUS AND OCCUPIED THE TOPMOST
STORY OF A TURRET RISING FROM THE DONJON KEEP
IT WAS CIRCULAR IN FORM
CARPETED WITH MATS OF SHINING STRAW CEILED WITH BEAMS ENRICHED WITH
FLEURS DE LIS OF GILDED METAL WITH INTERJOISTS IN COLOR WAINSCOATED
WITH RICH WOODS SOWN WITH ROSETTES OF WHITE METAL AND WITH OTHERS
PAINTED A FINE BRIGHT GREEN MADE OF ORPIMENT AND FINE INDIGO
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WINDOW A LONG POINTED CASEMENT LATTICED WITH BRASS
WIRE AND BARS OF IRON FURTHER DARKENED BY FINE COLORED PANES WITH THE
ARMS OF THE KING AND OF THE QUEEN EACH PANE BEING WORTH TWO AND TWENTY
SOLS
THERE WAS BUT ONE ENTRANCE A MODERN DOOR WITH A FIAT ARCH GARNISHED
WITH A PIECE OF TAPESTRY ON THE INSIDE AND ON THE OUTSIDE BY ONE OF
THOSE PORCHES OF IRISH WOOD FRAIL EDIFICES OF CABINET WORK CURIOUSLY
WROUGHT NUMBERS OF WHICH WERE STILL TO BE SEEN IN OLD HOUSES A HUNDRED
AND FIFTY YEARS AGO
ALTHOUGH THEY DISFIGURE AND EMBARRASS THE PLACES
SAYS SAUVEL IN DESPAIR OUR OLD PEOPLE ARE STILL UNWILLING TO GET RID
OF THEM AND KEEP THEM IN SPITE OF EVERYBODY
IN THIS CHAMBER NOTHING WAS TO BE FOUND OF WHAT FURNISHES ORDINARY
APARTMENTS NEITHER BENCHES NOR TRESTLES NOR FORMS NOR COMMON
STOOLS IN THE FORM OF A CHEST NOR FINE STOOLS SUSTAINED BY PILLARS AND
COUNTER PILLARS AT FOUR SOLS A PIECE
ONLY ONE EASY ARM CHAIR VERY
MAGNIFICENT WAS TO BE SEEN THE WOOD WAS PAINTED WITH ROSES ON A RED
GROUND THE SEAT WAS OF RUBY CORDOVAN LEATHER ORNAMENTED WITH LONG
SILKEN FRINGES AND STUDDED WITH A THOUSAND GOLDEN NAILS
THE LONELINESS
OF THIS CHAIR MADE IT APPARENT THAT ONLY ONE PERSON HAD A RIGHT TO SIT
DOWN IN THIS APARTMENT
BESIDE THE CHAIR AND QUITE CLOSE TO THE WINDOW
THERE WAS A TABLE COVERED WITH A CLOTH WITH A PATTERN OF BIRDS
ON THIS
TABLE STOOD AN INKHORN SPOTTED WITH INK SOME PARCHMENTS SEVERAL PENS
AND A LARGE GOBLET OF CHASED SILVER
A LITTLE FURTHER ON WAS A BRAZIER
A PRAYING STOOL IN CRIMSON VELVET RELIEVED WITH SMALL BOSSES OF GOLD
FINALLY AT THE EXTREME END OF THE ROOM A SIMPLE BED OF SCARLET AND
YELLOW DAMASK WITHOUT EITHER TINSEL OR LACE HAVING ONLY AN ORDINARY
FRINGE
THIS BED FAMOUS FOR HAVING BORNE THE SLEEP OR THE SLEEPLESSNESS
OF LOUIS XI WAS STILL TO BE SEEN TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO AT THE
HOUSE OF A COUNCILLOR OF STATE WHERE IT WAS SEEN BY OLD MADAME PILOU
CELEBRATED IN CYRUS UNDER THE NAME ARRICIDIE AND OF LA MORALE
VIVANTE
SUCH WAS THE CHAMBER WHICH WAS CALLED THE RETREAT WHERE MONSIEUR LOUIS
DE FRANCE SAYS HIS PRAYERS
AT THE MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE INTRODUCED THE READER INTO IT THIS RETREAT
WAS VERY DARK
THE CURFEW BELL HAD SOUNDED AN HOUR BEFORE NIGHT WAS
COME AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE FLICKERING WAX CANDLE SET ON THE TABLE TO
LIGHT FIVE PERSONS VARIOUSLY GROUPED IN THE CHAMBER
THE FIRST ON WHICH THE LIGHT FELL WAS A SEIGNEUR SUPERBLY CLAD IN
BREECHES AND JERKIN OF SCARLET STRIPED WITH SILVER AND A LOOSE COAT
WITH HALF SLEEVES OF CLOTH OF GOLD WITH BLACK FIGURES
THIS SPLENDID
COSTUME ON WHICH THE LIGHT PLAYED SEEMED GLAZED WITH FLAME ON EVERY
FOLD
THE MAN WHO WORE IT HAD HIS ARMORIAL BEARINGS EMBROIDERED ON HIS
BREAST IN VIVID COLORS A CHEVRON ACCOMPANIED BY A DEER PASSANT
THE
SHIELD WAS FLANKED ON THE RIGHT BY AN OLIVE BRANCH ON THE LEFT BY A
DEER'S ANTLERS
THIS MAN WORE IN HIS GIRDLE A RICH DAGGER WHOSE HILT
OF SILVER GILT WAS CHASED IN THE FORM OF A HELMET AND SURMOUNTED BY A
COUNT'S CORONET
HE HAD A FORBIDDING AIR A PROUD MIEN AND A HEAD
HELD HIGH
AT THE FIRST GLANCE ONE READ ARROGANCE ON HIS VISAGE AT THE
SECOND CRAFT
HE WAS STANDING BAREHEADED A LONG ROLL OF PARCHMENT IN HIS HAND BEHIND
THE ARM CHAIR IN WHICH WAS SEATED HIS BODY UNGRACEFULLY DOUBLED UP HIS
KNEES CROSSED HIS ELBOW ON THE TABLE A VERY BADLY ACCOUTRED PERSONAGE
LET THE READER IMAGINE IN FACT ON THE RICH SEAT OF CORDOVA LEATHER TWO
CROOKED KNEES TWO THIN THIGHS POORLY CLAD IN BLACK WORSTED TRICOT A
BODY ENVELOPED IN A CLOAK OF FUSTIAN WITH FUR TRIMMING OF WHICH MORE
LEATHER THAN HAIR WAS VISIBLE LASTLY TO CROWN ALL A GREASY OLD HAT OF
THE WORST SORT OF BLACK CLOTH BORDERED WITH A CIRCULAR STRING OF LEADEN
FIGURES
THIS IN COMPANY WITH A DIRTY SKULL CAP WHICH HARDLY ALLOWED A
HAIR TO ESCAPE WAS ALL THAT DISTINGUISHED THE SEATED PERSONAGE
HE HELD
HIS HEAD SO BENT UPON HIS BREAST THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN OF HIS
FACE THUS THROWN INTO SHADOW EXCEPT THE TIP OF HIS NOSE UPON WHICH
FELL A RAY OF LIGHT AND WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN LONG
FROM THE THINNESS OF
HIS WRINKLED HAND ONE DIVINED THAT HE WAS AN OLD MAN
IT WAS LOUIS XI
AT SOME DISTANCE BEHIND THEM TWO MEN DRESSED IN GARMENTS OF FLEMISH
STYLE WERE CONVERSING WHO WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY LOST IN THE SHADOW TO
PREVENT ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE PERFORMANCE OF GRINGOIRE'S
MYSTERY FROM RECOGNIZING IN THEM TWO OF THE PRINCIPAL FLEMISH ENVOYS
GUILLAUME RYM THE SAGACIOUS PENSIONER OF GHENT AND JACQUES COPPENOLE
THE POPULAR HOSIER
THE READER WILL REMEMBER THAT THESE MEN WERE MIXED
UP IN THE SECRET POLITICS OF LOUIS XI
FINALLY QUITE AT THE END OF
THE ROOM NEAR THE DOOR IN THE DARK STOOD MOTIONLESS AS A STATUE A
VIGOROUS MAN WITH THICKSET LIMBS A MILITARY HARNESS WITH A SURCOAT
OF ARMORIAL BEARINGS WHOSE SQUARE FACE PIERCED WITH STARING EYES SLIT
WITH AN IMMENSE MOUTH HIS EARS CONCEALED BY TWO LARGE SCREENS OF FLAT
HAIR HAD SOMETHING ABOUT IT BOTH OF THE DOG AND THE TIGER
ALL WERE UNCOVERED EXCEPT THE KING
THE GENTLEMAN WHO STOOD NEAR THE KING WAS READING HIM A SORT OF LONG
MEMORIAL TO WHICH HIS MAJESTY SEEMED TO BE LISTENING ATTENTIVELY
THE
TWO FLEMINGS WERE WHISPERING TOGETHER
CROSS OF GOD GRUMBLED COPPENOLE I AM TIRED OF STANDING IS THERE NO
CHAIR HERE
RYM REPLIED BY A NEGATIVE GESTURE ACCOMPANIED BY A DISCREET SMILE
CROIX DIEU RESUMED COPPENOLE THOROUGHLY UNHAPPY AT BEING OBLIGED TO
LOWER HIS VOICE THUS I SHOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN ON THE FLOOR WITH MY
LEGS CROSSED LIKE A HOSIER AS I DO IN MY SHOP
TAKE GOOD CARE THAT YOU DO NOT MASTER JACQUES
OUAIS MASTER GUILLAUME CAN ONE ONLY REMAIN HERE ON HIS FEET
OR ON HIS KNEES SAID RYM
AT THAT MOMENT THE KING'S VOICE WAS UPLIFTED
THEY HELD THEIR PEACE
FIFTY SOLS FOR THE ROBES OF OUR VALETS AND TWELVE LIVRES FOR THE
MANTLES OF THE CLERKS OF OUR CROWN THAT'S IT POUR OUT GOLD BY THE TON
ARE YOU MAD OLIVIER
AS HE SPOKE THUS THE OLD MAN RAISED HIS HEAD
THE GOLDEN SHELLS OF THE
COLLAR OF SAINT MICHAEL COULD BE SEEN GLEAMING ON HIS NECK
THE CANDLE
FULLY ILLUMINATED HIS GAUNT AND MOROSE PROFILE
HE TORE THE PAPERS FROM
THE OTHER'S HAND
YOU ARE RUINING US HE CRIED CASTING HIS HOLLOW EYES OVER THE SCROLL
WHAT IS ALL THIS WHAT NEED HAVE WE OF SO PRODIGIOUS A HOUSEHOLD TWO
CHAPLAINS AT TEN LIVRES A MONTH EACH AND A CHAPEL CLERK AT ONE HUNDRED
SOLS A VALET DE CHAMBRE AT NINETY LIVRES A YEAR

OF THE LOUVRE WILL MELT BEFORE SUCH A FIRE OF EXPENSES WE SHALL HAVE TO
SELL OUR PLATE AND NEXT YEAR IF GOD AND OUR LADY HERE HE RAISED HIS
HAT LEND US LIFE WE SHALL DRINK OUR POTIONS FROM A PEWTER POT
SO SAYING HE CAST A GLANCE AT THE SILVER GOBLET WHICH GLEAMED UPON THE
TABLE
HE COUGHED AND CONTINUED
MASTER OLIVIER THE PRINCES WHO REIGN OVER GREAT LORDSHIPS LIKE KINGS
AND EMPERORS SHOULD NOT ALLOW SUMPTUOUSNESS IN THEIR HOUSES FOR
THE FIRE SPREADS THENCE THROUGH THE PROVINCE
HENCE MASTER OLIVIER

HE PAUSED BREATHLESS THEN RESUMED ENERGETICALLY
I BEHOLD AROUND ME ONLY PEOPLE WHO FATTEN ON MY LEANNESS YOU SUCK
CROWNS FROM ME AT EVERY PORE
ALL REMAINED SILENT
THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE FITS OF WRATH WHICH ARE
ALLOWED TO TAKE THEIR COURSE
HE CONTINUED
'TIS LIKE THAT REQUEST IN LATIN FROM THE GENTLEMEN OF FRANCE THAT
WE SHOULD RE ESTABLISH WHAT THEY CALL THE GRAND CHARGES OF THE CROWN
CHARGES IN VERY DEED CHARGES WHICH CRUSH AH GENTLEMEN YOU SAY THAT
WE ARE NOT A KING TO REIGN DAPIFERO NULLO BUTICULARIO NULLO WE WILL
LET YOU SEE PASQUE DIEU WHETHER WE ARE NOT A KING
HERE HE SMILED IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS POWER THIS SOFTENED HIS BAD
HUMOR AND HE TURNED TOWARDS THE FLEMINGS
DO YOU SEE GOSSIP GUILLAUME THE GRAND WARDEN OF THE KEYS THE GRAND
BUTLER THE GRAND CHAMBERLAIN THE GRAND SENESCHAL ARE NOT WORTH THE
SMALLEST VALET
REMEMBER THIS GOSSIP COPPENOLE
THEY SERVE NO PURPOSE
AS THEY STAND THUS USELESS ROUND THE KING THEY PRODUCE UPON ME THE
EFFECT OF THE FOUR EVANGELISTS WHO SURROUND THE FACE OF THE BIG CLOCK OF
THE PALACE AND WHICH PHILIPPE BRILLE HAS JUST SET IN ORDER AFRESH
THEY
ARE GILT BUT THEY DO NOT INDICATE THE HOUR AND THE HANDS CAN GET ON
WITHOUT THEM
HE REMAINED IN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THEN ADDED SHAKING HIS AGED
HEAD
HO HO BY OUR LADY I AM NOT PHILIPPE BRILLE AND I SHALL NOT GILD THE
GREAT VASSALS ANEW
CONTINUE OLIVIER
THE PERSON WHOM HE DESIGNATED BY THIS NAME TOOK THE PAPERS INTO HIS
HANDS AGAIN AND BEGAN TO READ ALOUD

STATE WHICH WERE CALLED THE LITTLE DAUGHTERS OF THE KING IN ITS
WALLS THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LITTLE WINDOWS SO CLOSELY TRELLISED WITH
STOUT IRON BARS THAT THE GLASS WAS NOT VISIBLE
THE DOOR WAS A LARGE
FLAT SLAB OF STONE AS ON TOMBS THE SORT OF DOOR WHICH SERVES FOR
ENTRANCE ONLY

MASTER JEAN BALUE HAS LOST SIGHT OF HIS BISHOPRICS
MONSIEUR OF VERDUN HAS NO LONGER ONE ALL HAVE BEEN KILLED OFF
THE KING REASCENDED IN SILENCE TO HIS RETREAT AND HIS SUITE FOLLOWED

ALL AT ONCE HIS
MAJESTY TURNED TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE BASTILLE
BY THE WAY SAID HE WAS THERE NOT SOME ONE IN THAT CAGE
PARDIEU YES SIRE REPLIED THE GOVERNOR ASTOUNDED BY THE QUESTION
AND WHO WAS IT
MONSIEUR THE BISHOP OF VERDUN
THE KING KNEW THIS BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE
BUT IT WAS A MANIA OF HIS
AH SAID HE WITH THE INNOCENT AIR OF THINKING OF IT FOR THE FIRST
TIME GUILLAUME DE HARANCOURT THE FRIEND OF MONSIEUR THE CARDINAL
BALUE
A GOOD DEVIL OF A BISHOP
AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MOMENTS THE DOOR OF THE RETREAT HAD OPENED
AGAIN THEN CLOSED UPON THE FIVE PERSONAGES WHOM THE READER HAS SEEN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER AND WHO RESUMED THEIR PLACES THEIR
WHISPERED CONVERSATIONS AND THEIR ATTITUDES
DURING THE KING'S ABSENCE SEVERAL DESPATCHES HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIS
TABLE AND HE BROKE THE SEALS HIMSELF
THEN HE BEGAN TO READ THEM
PROMPTLY ONE AFTER THE OTHER MADE A SIGN TO MASTER OLIVIER WHO
APPEARED TO EXERCISE THE OFFICE OF MINISTER TO TAKE A PEN AND WITHOUT
COMMUNICATING TO HIM THE CONTENTS OF THE DESPATCHES HE BEGAN TO DICTATE
IN A LOW VOICE THE REPLIES WHICH THE LATTER WROTE ON HIS KNEES IN AN
INCONVENIENT ATTITUDE BEFORE THE TABLE
GUILLAUME RYM WAS ON THE WATCH
THE KING SPOKE SO LOW THAT THE FLEMINGS HEARD NOTHING OF HIS DICTATION
EXCEPT SOME ISOLATED AND RATHER UNINTELLIGIBLE SCRAPS SUCH AS
TO MAINTAIN THE FERTILE PLACES BY COMMERCE AND THE STERILE BY
MANUFACTURES TO SHOW THE ENGLISH LORDS OUR FOUR BOMBARDS LONDON
BRABANT BOURG EN BRESSE SAINT OMER ARTILLERY IS THE CAUSE OF
WAR BEING MADE MORE JUDICIOUSLY NOW TO MONSIEUR DE BRESSUIRE OUR
FRIEND ARMIES CANNOT BE MAINTAINED WITHOUT TRIBUTE ETC
ONCE HE RAISED HIS VOICE
PASQUE DIEU MONSIEUR THE KING OF SICILY SEALS HIS LETTERS WITH
YELLOW WAX LIKE A KING OF FRANCE
PERHAPS WE ARE IN THE WRONG TO PERMIT
HIM SO TO DO
MY FAIR COUSIN OF BURGUNDY GRANTED NO ARMORIAL BEARINGS

THE GRANDEUR OF HOUSES IS ASSURED BY THE
INTEGRITY OF PREROGATIVES
NOTE THIS FRIEND OLIVIER

OH OH SAID HE WHAT A LONG MESSAGE WHAT DOTH OUR BROTHER THE
EMPEROR CLAIM AND RUNNING HIS EYE OVER THE MISSIVE AND BREAKING
HIS READING WITH INTERJECTION SURELY THE GERMANS ARE SO GREAT AND
POWERFUL THAT IT IS HARDLY CREDIBLE BUT LET US NOT FORGET THE OLD
PROVERB 'THE FINEST COUNTY IS FLANDERS THE FINEST DUCHY MILAN THE
FINEST KINGDOM FRANCE IS IT NOT SO MESSIEURS FLEMINGS
THIS TIME COPPENOLE BOWED IN COMPANY WITH GUILLAUME RYM
THE HOSIER'S
PATRIOTISM WAS TICKLED

FROWN
WHAT IS THIS HE SAID COMPLAINTS AND FAULT FINDING AGAINST OUR
GARRISONS IN PICARDY OLIVIER WRITE WITH DILIGENCE TO M
THE MARSHAL
DE ROUAULT THAT DISCIPLINE IS RELAXED
THAT THE GENDARMES OF THE
UNATTACHED TROOPS THE FEUDAL NOBLES THE FREE ARCHERS AND THE SWISS
INFLICT INFINITE EVILS ON THE RUSTICS THAT THE MILITARY NOT CONTENT
WITH WHAT THEY FIND IN THE HOUSES OF THE RUSTICS CONSTRAIN THEM WITH
VIOLENT BLOWS OF CUDGEL OR OF LASH TO GO AND GET WINE SPICES AND OTHER
UNREASONABLE THINGS IN THE TOWN THAT MONSIEUR THE KING KNOWS THIS
THAT WE UNDERTAKE TO GUARD OUR PEOPLE AGAINST INCONVENIENCES LARCENIES
AND PILLAGE THAT SUCH IS OUR WILL BY OUR LADY THAT IN ADDITION IT
SUITS US NOT THAT ANY FIDDLER BARBER OR ANY SOLDIER VARLET SHOULD BE
CLAD LIKE A PRINCE IN VELVET CLOTH OF SILK AND RINGS OF GOLD THAT
THESE VANITIES ARE HATEFUL TO GOD THAT WE WHO ARE GENTLEMEN
CONTENT OURSELVES WITH A DOUBLET OF CLOTH AT SIXTEEN SOLS THE ELL OF
PARIS THAT MESSIEURS THE CAMP FOLLOWERS CAN VERY WELL COME DOWN
TO THAT ALSO COMMAND AND ORDAIN TO MONSIEUR DE ROUAULT OUR
FRIEND GOOD
HE DICTATED THIS LETTER ALOUD IN A FIRM TONE AND IN JERKS
AT THE
MOMENT WHEN HE FINISHED IT THE DOOR OPENED AND GAVE PASSAGE TO A
NEW PERSONAGE WHO PRECIPITATED HIMSELF INTO THE CHAMBER CRYING IN
AFFRIGHT
SIRE SIRE THERE IS A SEDITION OF THE POPULACE IN PARIS LOUIS XI 'S
GRAVE FACE CONTRACTED BUT ALL THAT WAS VISIBLE OF HIS EMOTION PASSED
AWAY LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING
HE CONTROLLED HIMSELF AND SAID WITH
TRANQUIL SEVERITY
GOSSIP JACQUES YOU ENTER VERY ABRUPTLY
SIRE SIRE THERE IS A REVOLT REPEATED GOSSIP JACQUES BREATHLESSLY
THE KING WHO HAD RISEN GRASPED HIM ROUGHLY BY THE ARM AND SAID IN
HIS EAR IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE HEARD BY HIM ALONE WITH CONCENTRATED
RAGE AND A SIDELONG GLANCE AT THE FLEMINGS
HOLD YOUR TONGUE OR SPEAK LOW
THE NEW COMER UNDERSTOOD AND BEGAN IN A LOW TONE TO GIVE A VERY
TERRIFIED ACCOUNT TO WHICH THE KING LISTENED CALMLY WHILE GUILLAUME
RYM CALLED COPPENOLE'S ATTENTION TO THE FACE AND DRESS OF THE NEW
ARRIVAL TO HIS FURRED COWL CAPUTIA FOURRATA HIS SHORT CAPE
EPITOGIA CURTA HIS ROBE OF BLACK VELVET WHICH BESPOKE A PRESIDENT
OF THE COURT OF ACCOUNTS
HARDLY HAD THIS PERSONAGE GIVEN THE KING SOME EXPLANATIONS WHEN LOUIS
XI
EXCLAIMED BURSTING INTO A LAUGH
IN TRUTH SPEAK ALOUD GOSSIP COICTIER WHAT CALL IS THERE FOR YOU
TO TALK SO LOW OUR LADY KNOWETH THAT WE CONCEAL NOTHING FROM OUR GOOD
FRIENDS THE FLEMINGS

SO RESUMED THE KING SPEAK SIR THERE IS A COMMOTION AMONG THE
LOUTS IN OUR GOOD CITY OF PARIS
YES SIRE
AND WHICH IS MOVING YOU SAY AGAINST MONSIEUR THE BAILIFF OF THE
PALAIS DE JUSTICE
SO IT APPEARS SAID THE GOSSIP WHO STILL STAMMERED UTTERLY ASTOUNDED
BY THE ABRUPT AND INEXPLICABLE CHANGE WHICH HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE IN THE
KING'S THOUGHTS
LOUIS XI
CONTINUED WHERE DID THE WATCH MEET THE RABBLE
MARCHING FROM THE GRAND TRUANDERIE TOWARDS THE PONT AUX CHANGEURS
I
MET IT MYSELF AS I WAS ON MY WAY HITHER TO OBEY YOUR MAJESTY'S COMMANDS
I HEARD SOME OF THEM SHOUTING 'DOWN WITH THE BAILIFF OF THE PALACE
AND WHAT COMPLAINTS HAVE THEY AGAINST THE BAILIFF
AH SAID GOSSIP JACQUES BECAUSE HE IS THEIR LORD
REALLY
YES SIRE
THEY ARE KNAVES FROM THE COUR DES MIRACLES
THEY HAVE BEEN
COMPLAINING THIS LONG WHILE OF THE BAILIFF WHOSE VASSALS THEY ARE
THEY DO NOT WISH TO RECOGNIZE HIM EITHER AS JUDGE OR AS VOYER
ONE IN CHARGE OF THE HIGHWAYS
YES CERTAINLY RETORTED THE KING WITH A SMILE OF SATIS FACTION WHICH
HE STROVE IN VAIN TO DISGUISE
IN ALL THEIR PETITIONS TO THE PARLIAMENT THEY CLAIM TO HAVE BUT TWO
MASTERS
YOUR MAJESTY AND THEIR GOD WHO IS THE DEVIL I BELIEVE
EH EH SAID THE KING
HE RUBBED HIS HANDS HE LAUGHED WITH THAT INWARD MIRTH WHICH MAKES THE
COUNTENANCE BEAM HE WAS UNABLE TO DISSIMULATE HIS JOY ALTHOUGH HE
ENDEAVORED AT MOMENTS TO COMPOSE HIMSELF
NO ONE UNDERSTOOD IT IN THE
LEAST NOT EVEN MASTER OLIVIER
HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT WITH A
THOUGHTFUL BUT CONTENTED AIR
ARE THEY IN FORCE HE SUDDENLY INQUIRED
YES ASSUREDLY SIRE REPLIED GOSSIP JACQUES
HOW MANY
SIX THOUSAND AT THE LEAST
THE KING COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING GOOD HE WENT ON

WITH SCYTHES PIKES HACKBUTS PICKAXES
ALL SORTS OF VERY VIOLENT
WEAPONS
THE KING DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST DISTURBED BY THIS LIST
JACQUES
CONSIDERED IT HIS DUTY TO ADD
IF YOUR MAJESTY DOES NOT SEND PROMPT SUCCOR TO THE BAILIFF HE IS
LOST
WE WILL SEND SAID THE KING WITH AN AIR OF FALSE SERIOUSNESS
IT IS
WELL
ASSUREDLY WE WILL SEND
MONSIEUR THE BAILIFF IS OUR FRIEND
SIX
THOUSAND THEY ARE DESPERATE SCAMPS THEIR AUDACITY IS MARVELLOUS AND
WE ARE GREATLY ENRAGED AT IT
BUT WE HAVE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE ABOUT US
TO NIGHT
TO MORROW MORNING WILL BE TIME ENOUGH
GOSSIP JACQUES EXCLAIMED INSTANTLY SIRE THERE WILL BE TIME TO SACK
THE BAILIWICK A SCORE OF TIMES TO VIOLATE THE SEIGNORY TO HANG THE
BAILIFF
FOR GOD'S SAKE SIRE SEND BEFORE TO MORROW MORNING
THE KING LOOKED HIM FULL IN THE FACE
I HAVE TOLD YOU TO MORROW
MORNING
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE LOOKS TO WHICH ONE DOES NOT REPLY
AFTER A SILENCE
LOUIS XI
RAISED HIS VOICE ONCE MORE
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT GOSSIP JACQUES
WHAT WAS
HE CORRECTED HIMSELF
WHAT IS THE BAILIFF'S FEUDAL JURISDICTION
SIRE THE BAILIFF OF THE PALACE HAS THE RUE CALENDRE AS FAR AS THE RUE
DE L'HERBERIE THE PLACE SAINT MICHEL AND THE LOCALITIES VULGARLY KNOWN
AS THE MUREAUX SITUATED NEAR THE CHURCH OF NOTRE DAME DES CHAMPS HERE
LOUIS XI
RAISED THE BRIM OF HIS HAT WHICH HOTELS NUMBER THIRTEEN
PLUS THE COUR DES MIRACLES PLUS THE MALADERIE CALLED THE BANLIEUE
PLUS THE WHOLE HIGHWAY WHICH BEGINS AT THAT MALADERIE AND ENDS AT THE
PORTE SAINTE JACQUES
OF THESE DIVERS PLACES HE IS VOYER HIGH MIDDLE
AND LOW JUSTICIARY FULL SEIGNEUR
BLESS ME SAID THE KING SCRATCHING HIS LEFT EAR WITH HIS RIGHT HAND
THAT MAKES A GOODLY BIT OF MY CITY AH MONSIEUR THE BAILIFF WAS KING
OF ALL THAT
THIS TIME HE DID NOT CORRECT HIMSELF
HE CONTINUED DREAMILY AND AS
THOUGH SPEAKING TO HIMSELF
VERY FINE MONSIEUR THE BAILIFF YOU HAD THERE BETWEEN YOUR TEETH A
PRETTY SLICE OF OUR PARIS
ALL AT ONCE HE BROKE OUT EXPLOSIVELY PASQUE DIEU WHAT PEOPLE ARE
THOSE WHO CLAIM TO BE VOYERS JUSTICIARIES LORDS AND MASTERS IN OUR
DOMAINS WHO HAVE THEIR TOLLGATES AT THE END OF EVERY FIELD THEIR
GALLOWS AND THEIR HANGMAN AT EVERY CROSS ROAD AMONG OUR PEOPLE SO THAT
AS THE GREEK BELIEVED THAT HE HAD AS MANY GODS AS THERE WERE FOUNTAINS
AND THE PERSIAN AS MANY AS HE BEHELD STARS THE FRENCHMAN COUNTS AS MANY
KINGS AS HE SEES GIBBETS PARDIEU 'TIS AN EVIL THING AND THE CONFUSION
OF IT DISPLEASES ME
I SHOULD GREATLY LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER IT BE THE
MERCY OF GOD THAT THERE SHOULD BE IN PARIS ANY OTHER LORD THAN THE KING
ANY OTHER JUDGE THAN OUR PARLIAMENT ANY OTHER EMPEROR THAN OURSELVES IN
THIS EMPIRE BY THE FAITH OF MY SOUL THE DAY MUST CERTAINLY COME WHEN
THERE SHALL EXIST IN FRANCE BUT ONE KING ONE LORD ONE JUDGE ONE
HEADSMAN AS THERE IS IN PARADISE BUT ONE GOD
HE LIFTED HIS CAP AGAIN AND CONTINUED STILL DREAMILY WITH THE AIR
AND ACCENT OF A HUNTER WHO IS CHEERING ON HIS PACK OF HOUNDS GOOD MY
PEOPLE BRAVELY DONE BREAK THESE FALSE LORDS DO YOUR DUTY AT THEM
HAVE AT THEM PILLAGE THEM TAKE THEM SACK THEM
AH YOU WANT TO BE
KINGS MESSEIGNEURS ON MY PEOPLE ON
HERE HE INTERRUPTED HIMSELF ABRUPTLY BIT HIS LIPS AS THOUGH TO TAKE
BACK HIS THOUGHT WHICH HAD ALREADY HALF ESCAPED BENT HIS PIERCING EYES
IN TURN ON EACH OF THE FIVE PERSONS WHO SURROUNDED HIM AND SUDDENLY
GRASPING HIS HAT WITH BOTH HANDS AND STARING FULL AT IT HE SAID TO IT
OH I WOULD BURN YOU IF YOU KNEW WHAT THERE WAS IN MY HEAD
THEN CASTING ABOUT HIM ONCE MORE THE CAUTIOUS AND UNEASY GLANCE OF THE
FOX RE ENTERING HIS HOLE
NO MATTER WE WILL SUCCOR MONSIEUR THE BAILIFF
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE
BUT FEW TROOPS HERE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT AGAINST SO GREAT A POPULACE
WE MUST WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW
THE ORDER WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE CITY
AND EVERY ONE WHO IS CAUGHT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY HUNG
BY THE WAY SIRE SAID GOSSIP COICTIER I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT IN THE
FIRST AGITATION THE WATCH HAVE SEIZED TWO LAGGARDS OF THE BAND
IF YOUR
MAJESTY DESIRES TO SEE THESE MEN THEY ARE HERE
IF I DESIRE TO SEE THEM CRIED THE KING
WHAT PASQUE DIEU YOU
FORGET A THING LIKE THAT RUN QUICK YOU OLIVIER GO SEEK THEM
MASTER OLIVIER QUITTED THE ROOM AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER WITH THE TWO
PRISONERS SURROUNDED BY ARCHERS OF THE GUARD
THE FIRST HAD A COARSE
IDIOTIC DRUNKEN AND ASTONISHED FACE
HE WAS CLOTHED IN RAGS AND WALKED
WITH ONE KNEE BENT AND DRAGGING HIS LEG
THE SECOND HAD A PALLID AND
SMILING COUNTENANCE WITH WHICH THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED
THE KING SURVEYED THEM FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD THEN
ADDRESSING THE FIRST ONE ABRUPTLY
WHAT'S YOUR NAME
GIEFFROY PINCEBOURDE
YOUR TRADE
OUTCAST
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO DO IN THIS DAMNABLE SEDITION THE OUTCAST
STARED AT THE KING AND SWUNG HIS ARMS WITH A STUPID AIR
HE HAD ONE OF THOSE AWKWARDLY SHAPED HEADS WHERE INTELLIGENCE IS ABOUT
AS MUCH AT ITS EASE AS A LIGHT BENEATH AN EXTINGUISHER
I KNOW NOT SAID HE
THEY WENT I WENT
WERE YOU NOT GOING TO OUTRAGEOUSLY ATTACK AND PILLAGE YOUR LORD THE
BAILIFF OF THE PALACE
I KNOW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM SOME ONE
THAT IS
ALL
A SOLDIER POINTED OUT TO THE KING A BILLHOOK WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON THE
PERSON OF THE VAGABOND
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS WEAPON DEMANDED THE KING
YES 'TIS MY BILLHOOK I AM A VINE DRESSER
AND DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN AS YOUR COMPANION ADDED LOUIS XI
POINTING TO THE OTHER PRISONER
NO I DO NOT KNOW HIM
THAT WILL DO SAID THE KING MAKING A SIGN WITH HIS FINGER TO THE
SILENT PERSONAGE WHO STOOD MOTIONLESS BESIDE THE DOOR TO WHOM WE HAVE
ALREADY CALLED THE READER'S ATTENTION
GOSSIP TRISTAN HERE IS A MAN FOR YOU
TRISTAN L'HERMITE BOWED
HE GAVE AN ORDER IN A LOW VOICE TO TWO ARCHERS
WHO LED AWAY THE POOR VAGABOND
IN THE MEANTIME THE KING HAD APPROACHED THE SECOND PRISONER WHO WAS
PERSPIRING IN GREAT DROPS YOUR NAME
SIRE PIERRE GRINGOIRE
YOUR TRADE
PHILOSOPHER SIRE
HOW DO YOU PERMIT YOURSELF KNAVE TO GO AND BESIEGE OUR FRIEND
MONSIEUR THE BAILIFF OF THE PALACE AND WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CONCERNING
THIS POPULAR AGITATION
SIRE I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
COME NOW YOU WANTON WRETCH WERE NOT YOU APPREHENDED BY THE WATCH IN
THAT BAD COMPANY
NO SIRE THERE IS A MISTAKE
'TIS A FATALITY
I MAKE TRAGEDIES
SIRE
I ENTREAT YOUR MAJESTY TO LISTEN TO ME
I AM A POET
'TIS THE MELANCHOLY
WAY OF MEN OF MY PROFESSION TO ROAM THE STREETS BY NIGHT
I WAS PASSING
THERE
IT WAS MERE CHANCE
I WAS UNJUSTLY ARRESTED I AM INNOCENT
OF THIS CIVIL TEMPEST
YOUR MAJESTY SEES THAT THE VAGABOND DID NOT
RECOGNIZE ME
I CONJURE YOUR MAJESTY
HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID THE KING BETWEEN TWO SWALLOWS OF HIS PTISAN
YOU SPLIT OUR HEAD
TRISTAN L'HERMITE ADVANCED AND POINTING TO GRINGOIRE
SIRE CAN THIS ONE BE HANGED ALSO
THIS WAS THE FIRST WORD THAT HE HAD UTTERED
PHEW REPLIED THE KING I SEE NO OBJECTION
I SEE A GREAT MANY SAID GRINGOIRE
AT THAT MOMENT OUR PHILOSOPHER WAS GREENER THAN AN OLIVE
HE PERCEIVED
FROM THE KING'S COLD AND INDIFFERENT MIEN THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER
RESOURCE THAN SOMETHING VERY PATHETIC AND HE FLUNG HIMSELF AT THE FEET
OF LOUIS XI EXCLAIMING WITH GESTURES OF DESPAIR
SIRE WILL YOUR MAJESTY DEIGN TO HEAR ME
SIRE BREAK NOT IN THUNDER
OVER SO SMALL A THING AS MYSELF
GOD'S GREAT LIGHTNING DOTH NOT BOMBARD
A LETTUCE
SIRE YOU ARE AN AUGUST AND VERY PUISSANT MONARCH HAVE PITY
ON A POOR MAN WHO IS HONEST AND WHO WOULD FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO
STIR UP A REVOLT THAN A CAKE OF ICE WOULD TO GIVE OUT A SPARK VERY
GRACIOUS SIRE KINDNESS IS THE VIRTUE OF A LION AND A KING
ALAS RIGOR
ONLY FRIGHTENS MINDS THE IMPETUOUS GUSTS OF THE NORTH WIND DO NOT MAKE
THE TRAVELLER LAY ASIDE HIS CLOAK THE SUN BESTOWING HIS RAYS LITTLE BY
LITTLE WARMS HIM IN SUCH WAYS THAT IT WILL MAKE HIM STRIP TO HIS SHIRT
SIRE YOU ARE THE SUN
I PROTEST TO YOU MY SOVEREIGN LORD AND MASTER
THAT I AM NOT AN OUTCAST THIEF AND DISORDERLY FELLOW
REVOLT AND
BRIGANDAGE BELONG NOT TO THE OUTFIT OF APOLLO
I AM NOT THE MAN TO FLING
MYSELF INTO THOSE CLOUDS WHICH BREAK OUT INTO SEDITIOUS CLAMOR
I AM
YOUR MAJESTY'S FAITHFUL VASSAL
THAT SAME JEALOUSY WHICH A HUSBAND
CHERISHETH FOR THE HONOR OF HIS WIFE THE RESENTMENT WHICH THE SON HATH
FOR THE LOVE OF HIS FATHER A GOOD VASSAL SHOULD FEEL FOR THE GLORY
OF HIS KING HE SHOULD PINE AWAY FOR THE ZEAL OF THIS HOUSE FOR
THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF HIS SERVICE
EVERY OTHER PASSION WHICH SHOULD
TRANSPORT HIM WOULD BE BUT MADNESS
THESE SIRE ARE MY MAXIMS OF STATE
THEN DO NOT JUDGE ME TO BE A SEDITIOUS AND THIEVING RASCAL BECAUSE MY
GARMENT IS WORN AT THE ELBOWS
IF YOU WILL GRANT ME MERCY SIRE I WILL
WEAR IT OUT ON THE KNEES IN PRAYING TO GOD FOR YOU NIGHT AND MORNING
ALAS I AM NOT EXTREMELY RICH 'TIS TRUE
I AM EVEN RATHER POOR
BUT
NOT VICIOUS ON THAT ACCOUNT
IT IS NOT MY FAULT
EVERY ONE KNOWETH THAT
GREAT WEALTH IS NOT TO BE DRAWN FROM LITERATURE AND THAT THOSE WHO ARE
BEST POSTED IN GOOD BOOKS DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT FIRE IN WINTER
THE ADVOCATE'S TRADE TAKETH ALL THE GRAIN AND LEAVETH ONLY STRAW TO THE
OTHER SCIENTIFIC PROFESSIONS
THERE ARE FORTY VERY EXCELLENT PROVERBS
ANENT THE HOLE RIDDEN CLOAK OF THE PHILOSOPHER
OH SIRE CLEMENCY IS
THE ONLY LIGHT WHICH CAN ENLIGHTEN THE INTERIOR OF SO GREAT A SOUL
CLEMENCY BEARETH THE TORCH BEFORE ALL THE OTHER VIRTUES
WITHOUT IT THEY
ARE BUT BLIND MEN GROPING AFTER GOD IN THE DARK
COMPASSION WHICH IS
THE SAME THING AS CLEMENCY CAUSETH THE LOVE OF SUBJECTS WHICH IS THE
MOST POWERFUL BODYGUARD TO A PRINCE
WHAT MATTERS IT TO YOUR MAJESTY
WHO DAZZLES ALL FACES IF THERE IS ONE POOR MAN MORE ON EARTH A POOR
INNOCENT PHILOSOPHER SPLUTTERING AMID THE SHADOWS OF CALAMITY WITH AN
EMPTY POCKET WHICH RESOUNDS AGAINST HIS HOLLOW BELLY MOREOVER SIRE
I AM A MAN OF LETTERS
GREAT KINGS MAKE A PEARL FOR THEIR CROWNS BY
PROTECTING LETTERS
HERCULES DID NOT DISDAIN THE TITLE OF MUSAGETES
MATHIAS CORVIN FAVORED JEAN DE MONROYAL THE ORNAMENT OF MATHEMATICS
NOW 'TIS AN ILL WAY TO PROTECT LETTERS TO HANG MEN OF LETTERS
WHAT A
STAIN ON ALEXANDER IF HE HAD HUNG ARISTOTELES THIS ACT WOULD NOT BE A
LITTLE PATCH ON THE FACE OF HIS REPUTATION TO EMBELLISH IT BUT A VERY
MALIGNANT ULCER TO DISFIGURE IT
SIRE I MADE A VERY PROPER EPITHALAMIUM
FOR MADEMOISELLE OF FLANDERS AND MONSEIGNEUR THE VERY AUGUST DAUPHIN
THAT IS NOT A FIREBRAND OF REBELLION
YOUR MAJESTY SEES THAT I AM NOT
A SCRIBBLER OF NO REPUTATION THAT I HAVE STUDIED EXCELLENTLY WELL AND
THAT I POSSESS MUCH NATURAL ELOQUENCE
HAVE MERCY UPON ME SIRE IN SO
DOING YOU WILL PERFORM A GALLANT DEED TO OUR LADY AND I SWEAR TO YOU
THAT I AM GREATLY TERRIFIED AT THE IDEA OF BEING HANGED
SO SAYING THE UNHAPPY GRINGOIRE KISSED THE KING'S SLIPPERS AND
GUILLAUME RYM SAID TO COPPENOLE IN A LOW TONE HE DOTH WELL TO DRAG
HIMSELF ON THE EARTH
KINGS ARE LIKE THE JUPITER OF CRETE THEY HAVE
EARS ONLY IN THEIR FEET AND WITHOUT TROUBLING HIMSELF ABOUT THE
JUPITER OF CRETE THE HOSIER REPLIED WITH A HEAVY SMILE AND HIS EYES
FIXED ON GRINGOIRE OH THAT'S IT EXACTLY I SEEM TO HEAR CHANCELLOR
HUGONET CRAVING MERCY OF ME
WHEN GRINGOIRE PAUSED AT LAST QUITE OUT OF BREATH HE RAISED HIS HEAD
TREMBLINGLY TOWARDS THE KING WHO WAS ENGAGED IN SCRATCHING A SPOT ON
THE KNEE OF HIS BREECHES WITH HIS FINGER NAIL THEN HIS MAJESTY BEGAN
TO DRINK FROM THE GOBLET OF PTISAN
BUT HE UTTERED NOT A WORD AND THIS
SILENCE TORTURED GRINGOIRE
AT LAST THE KING LOOKED AT HIM
HERE IS A
TERRIBLE BAWLER SAID HE
THEN TURNING TO TRISTAN L'HERMITE BALI
LET HIM GO
GRINGOIRE FELL BACKWARDS QUITE THUNDERSTRUCK WITH JOY
AT LIBERTY GROWLED TRISTAN DOTH NOT YOUR MAJESTY WISH TO HAVE HIM
DETAINED A LITTLE WHILE IN A CAGE
GOSSIP RETORTED LOUIS XI THINK YOU THAT 'TIS FOR BIRDS OF THIS
FEATHER THAT WE CAUSE TO BE MADE CAGES AT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN
LIVRES EIGHT SOUS THREE DENIERS APIECE RELEASE HIM AT ONCE
THE WANTON LOUIS XI
WAS FOND OF THIS WORD WHICH FORMED WITH
PASQUE DIEU THE FOUNDATION OF HIS JOVIALITY AND PUT HIM OUT WITH A
BUFFET
UGH CRIED GRINGOIRE WHAT A GREAT KING IS HERE
AND FOR FEAR OF A COUNTER ORDER HE RUSHED TOWARDS THE DOOR WHICH
TRISTAN OPENED FOR HIM WITH A VERY BAD GRACE
THE SOLDIERS LEFT THE ROOM
WITH HIM PUSHING HIM BEFORE THEM WITH STOUT THWACKS WHICH GRINGOIRE
BORE LIKE A TRUE STOICAL PHILOSOPHER
THE KING'S GOOD HUMOR SINCE THE REVOLT AGAINST THE BAILIFF HAD BEEN
ANNOUNCED TO HIM MADE ITSELF APPARENT IN EVERY WAY
THIS UNWONTED
CLEMENCY WAS NO SMALL SIGN OF IT
TRISTAN L'HERMITE IN HIS CORNER WORE
THE SURLY LOOK OF A DOG WHO HAS HAD A BONE SNATCHED AWAY FROM HIM
MEANWHILE THE KING THRUMMED GAYLY WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE ARM OF HIS
CHAIR THE MARCH OF PONT AUDEMER
HE WAS A DISSEMBLING PRINCE BUT ONE
WHO UNDERSTOOD FAR BETTER HOW TO HIDE HIS TROUBLES THAN HIS JOYS
THESE
EXTERNAL MANIFESTATIONS OF JOY AT ANY GOOD NEWS SOMETIMES PROCEEDED TO
VERY GREAT LENGTHS THUS ON THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE BOLD TO THE POINT
OF VOWING SILVER BALUSTRADES TO SAINT MARTIN OF TOURS ON HIS ADVENT TO
THE THRONE SO FAR AS FORGETTING TO ORDER HIS FATHER'S OBSEQUIES
H SIRE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED JACQUES COICTIER WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE
ACUTE ATTACK OF ILLNESS FOR WHICH YOUR MAJESTY HAD ME SUMMONED
OH SAID THE KING I REALLY SUFFER GREATLY MY GOSSIP
THERE IS A
HISSING IN MY EAR AND FIERY RAKES RACK MY CHEST
COICTIER TOOK THE KING'S HAND AND BEGUN TO FEEL OF HIS PULSE WITH A
KNOWING AIR
LOOK COPPENOLE SAID RYM IN A LOW VOICE
BEHOLD HIM BETWEEN
COICTIER AND TRISTAN
THEY ARE HIS WHOLE COURT
A PHYSICIAN FOR HIMSELF
A HEADSMAN FOR OTHERS
AS HE FELT THE KING'S PULSE COICTIER ASSUMED AN AIR OF GREATER AND
GREATER ALARM
LOUIS XI
WATCHED HIM WITH SOME ANXIETY
COICTIER GREW
VISIBLY MORE GLOOMY
THE BRAVE MAN HAD NO OTHER FARM THAN THE KING'S BAD
HEALTH
HE SPECULATED ON IT TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY
OH OH HE MURMURED AT LENGTH THIS IS SERIOUS INDEED
IS IT NOT SAID THE KING UNEASILY
PULSUS CREBER ANHELANS CREPITANS IRREGULARIS CONTINUED THE
LEECH
PASQUE DIEU
THIS MAY CARRY OFF ITS MAN IN LESS THAN THREE DAYS
OUR LADY EXCLAIMED THE KING
AND THE REMEDY GOSSIP
I AM MEDITATING UPON THAT SIRE
HE MADE LOUIS XI
PUT OUT HIS TONGUE SHOOK HIS HEAD MADE A GRIMACE
AND IN THE VERY MIDST OF THESE AFFECTATIONS
PARDIEU SIRE HE SUDDENLY SAID I MUST TELL YOU THAT THERE IS
A RECEIVERSHIP OF THE ROYAL PREROGATIVES VACANT AND THAT I HAVE A
NEPHEW
I GIVE THE RECEIVERSHIP TO YOUR NEPHEW GOSSIP JACQUES REPLIED THE
KING BUT DRAW THIS FIRE FROM MY BREAST
SINCE YOUR MAJESTY IS SO CLEMENT REPLIED THE LEECH YOU WILL
NOT REFUSE TO AID ME A LITTLE IN BUILDING MY HOUSE RUE
SAINT ANDR DES ARCS
HEUGH SAID THE KING
I AM AT THE END OF MY FINANCES PURSUED THE DOCTOR AND IT WOULD
REALLY BE A PITY THAT THE HOUSE SHOULD NOT HAVE A ROOF NOT ON ACCOUNT
OF THE HOUSE WHICH IS SIMPLE AND THOROUGHLY BOURGEOIS BUT BECAUSE OF
THE PAINTINGS OF JEHAN FOURBAULT WHICH ADORN ITS WAINSCOATING
THERE IS
A DIANA FLYING IN THE AIR BUT SO EXCELLENT SO TENDER SO DELICATE
OF SO INGENUOUS AN ACTION HER HAIR SO WELL COIFFED AND ADORNED WITH A
CRESCENT HER FLESH SO WHITE THAT SHE LEADS INTO TEMPTATION THOSE WHO
REGARD HER TOO CURIOUSLY
THERE IS ALSO A CERES
SHE IS ANOTHER VERY
FAIR DIVINITY
SHE IS SEATED ON SHEAVES OF WHEAT AND CROWNED WITH A
GALLANT GARLAND OF WHEAT EARS INTERLACED WITH SALSIFY AND OTHER FLOWERS
NEVER WERE SEEN MORE AMOROUS EYES MORE ROUNDED LIMBS A NOBLER AIR
OR A MORE GRACEFULLY FLOWING SKIRT
SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST INNOCENT AND
MOST PERFECT BEAUTIES WHOM THE BRUSH HAS EVER PRODUCED
EXECUTIONER GRUMBLED LOUIS XI WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
I MUST HAVE A ROOF FOR THESE PAINTINGS SIRE AND ALTHOUGH 'TIS BUT A
SMALL MATTER I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
HOW MUCH DOTH YOUR ROOF COST
WHY A ROOF OF COPPER EMBELLISHED AND GILT TWO THOUSAND LIVRES AT THE
MOST
AH ASSASSIN CRIED THE KING HE NEVER DRAWS OUT ONE OF MY TEETH
WHICH IS NOT A DIAMOND
AM I TO HAVE MY ROOF SAID COICTIER
YES AND GO TO THE DEVIL BUT CURE ME
JACQUES COICTIER BOWED LOW AND SAID
SIRE IT IS A REPELLENT WHICH WILL SAVE YOU
WE WILL APPLY TO YOUR
LOINS THE GREAT DEFENSIVE COMPOSED OF CERATE ARMENIAN BOLE WHITE OF
EGG OIL AND VINEGAR
YOU WILL CONTINUE YOUR PTISAN AND WE WILL ANSWER
FOR YOUR MAJESTY
A BURNING CANDLE DOES NOT ATTRACT ONE GNAT ALONE
MASTER OLIVIER
PERCEIVING THE KING TO BE IN A LIBERAL MOOD AND JUDGING THE MOMENT TO
BE PROPITIOUS APPROACHED IN HIS TURN
SIRE
WHAT IS IT NOW SAID LOUIS XI
SIRE YOUR MAJESTY KNOWETH THAT SIMON
RADIN IS DEAD
WELL
HE WAS COUNCILLOR TO THE KING IN THE MATTER OF THE COURTS OF THE
TREASURY
WELL
SIRE HIS PLACE IS VACANT
AS HE SPOKE THUS MASTER OLIVIER'S HAUGHTY FACE QUITTED ITS ARROGANT
EXPRESSION FOR A LOWLY ONE
IT IS THE ONLY CHANGE WHICH EVER TAKES PLACE
IN A COURTIER'S VISAGE
THE KING LOOKED HIM WELL IN THE FACE AND SAID IN
A DRY TONE I UNDERSTAND
HE RESUMED
MASTER OLIVIER THE MARSHAL DE BOUCICAUT WAS WONT TO SAY 'THERE'S NO
MASTER SAVE THE KING THERE ARE NO FISHES SAVE IN THE SEA I SEE THAT
YOU AGREE WITH MONSIEUR DE BOUCICAUT
NOW LISTEN TO THIS WE HAVE A GOOD
MEMORY
IN '68 WE MADE YOU VALET OF OUR CHAMBER IN '69 GUARDIAN OF THE
FORTRESS OF THE BRIDGE OF SAINT CLOUD AT A HUNDRED LIVRES OF TOURNAY IN
WAGES YOU WANTED THEM OF PARIS

JEHAN DAIZ THEN CAPTAIN OF THE CHTEAU OF LOCHES THEN GOVERNOR OF
SAINT QUENTIN THEN CAPTAIN OF THE BRIDGE OF MEULAN OF WHICH YOU CAUSE
YOURSELF TO BE CALLED COMTE
OUT OF THE FIVE SOLS FINE PAID BY EVERY
BARBER WHO SHAVES ON A FESTIVAL DAY THERE ARE THREE SOLS FOR YOU AND

WE HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO CHANGE YOUR NAME OF LE
MAUVAIS THE EVIL WHICH RESEMBLED YOUR FACE TOO CLOSELY

SUFFICIENTLY FINE AND MIRACULOUS ARE YOU NOT AFRAID THAT ONE SALMON
MORE WILL MAKE YOUR BOAT SINK PRIDE WILL BE YOUR RUIN GOSSIP
RUIN AND
DISGRACE ALWAYS PRESS HARD ON THE HEELS OF PRIDE
CONSIDER THIS AND HOLD
YOUR TONGUE
A LORD HAVING A RIGHT ON THE WOODS OF HIS VASSALS
THESE WORDS UTTERED WITH SEVERITY MADE MASTER OLIVIER'S FACE REVERT TO
ITS INSOLENCE
GOOD HE MUTTERED ALMOST ALOUD 'TIS EASY TO SEE THAT THE KING IS
ILL TO DAY HE GIVETH ALL TO THE LEECH
LOUIS XI
FAR FROM BEING IRRITATED BY THIS PETULANT INSULT RESUMED WITH
SOME GENTLENESS STAY I WAS FORGETTING THAT I MADE YOU MY AMBASSADOR
TO MADAME MARIE AT GHENT
YES GENTLEMEN ADDED THE KING TURNING TO
THE FLEMINGS THIS MAN HATH BEEN AN AMBASSADOR
THERE MY GOSSIP HE
PURSUED ADDRESSING MASTER OLIVIER LET US NOT GET ANGRY WE ARE OLD
FRIENDS
'TIS VERY LATE
WE HAVE TERMINATED OUR LABORS
SHAVE ME
OUR READERS HAVE NOT WITHOUT DOUBT WAITED UNTIL THE PRESENT MOMENT TO
RECOGNIZE IN MASTER OLIVIER THAT TERRIBLE FIGARO WHOM PROVIDENCE THE
GREAT MAKER OF DRAMAS MINGLED SO ARTISTICALLY IN THE LONG AND BLOODY
COMEDY OF THE REIGN OF LOUIS XI
WE WILL NOT HERE UNDERTAKE TO DEVELOP
THAT SINGULAR FIGURE
THIS BARBER OF THE KING HAD THREE NAMES
AT COURT
HE WAS POLITELY CALLED OLIVIER LE DAIM THE DEER AMONG THE PEOPLE
OLIVIER THE DEVIL
HIS REAL NAME WAS OLIVIER LE MAUVAIS
ACCORDINGLY OLIVIER LE MAUVAIS REMAINED MOTIONLESS SULKING AT THE
KING AND GLANCING ASKANCE AT JACQUES COICTIER
YES YES THE PHYSICIAN HE SAID BETWEEN HIS TEETH
AH YES THE PHYSICIAN RETORTED LOUIS XI WITH SINGULAR GOOD HUMOR
THE PHYSICIAN HAS MORE CREDIT THAN YOU
'TIS VERY SIMPLE HE HAS TAKEN
HOLD UPON US BY THE WHOLE BODY AND YOU HOLD US ONLY BY THE CHIN
COME

WHAT WOULD YOU SAY AND WHAT WOULD
BECOME OF YOUR OFFICE IF I WERE A KING LIKE CHILPERIC WHOSE GESTURE
CONSISTED IN HOLDING HIS BEARD IN ONE HAND COME GOSSIP MINE FULFIL
YOUR OFFICE SHAVE ME
GO GET WHAT YOU NEED THEREFOR
OLIVIER PERCEIVING THAT THE KING HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO LAUGH AND THAT
THERE WAS NO WAY OF EVEN ANNOYING HIM WENT OFF GRUMBLING TO EXECUTE HIS
ORDERS
THE KING ROSE APPROACHED THE WINDOW AND SUDDENLY OPENING IT WITH
EXTRAORDINARY AGITATION
OH YES HE EXCLAIMED CLAPPING HIS HANDS YONDER IS A REDNESS IN THE
SKY OVER THE CITY
'TIS THE BAILIFF BURNING
IT CAN BE NOTHING ELSE BUT
THAT
AH MY GOOD PEOPLE HERE YOU ARE AIDING ME AT LAST IN TEARING DOWN
THE RIGHTS OF LORDSHIP
THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE FLEMINGS COME LOOK AT THIS GENTLEMEN
IS IT
NOT A FIRE WHICH GLOWETH YONDER
THE TWO MEN OF GHENT DREW NEAR
A GREAT FIRE SAID GUILLAUME RYM
OH EXCLAIMED COPPENOLE WHOSE EYES SUDDENLY FLASHED THAT REMINDS ME
OF THE BURNING OF THE HOUSE OF THE SEIGNEUR D'HYMBERCOURT
THERE MUST BE
A GOODLY REVOLT YONDER
YOU THINK SO MASTER COPPENOLE AND LOUIS XI 'S GLANCE WAS ALMOST AS
JOYOUS AS THAT OF THE HOSIER
WILL IT NOT BE DIFFICULT TO RESIST
CROSS OF GOD SIRE YOUR MAJESTY WILL DAMAGE MANY COMPANIES OF MEN OF
WAR THEREON
AH I 'TIS DIFFERENT RETURNED THE KING
IF I WILLED THE HOSIER
REPLIED HARDILY
IF THIS REVOLT BE WHAT I SUPPOSE SIRE YOU MIGHT WILL IN VAIN
GOSSIP SAID LOUIS XI WITH THE TWO COMPANIES OF MY UNATTACHED
TROOPS AND ONE DISCHARGE OF A SERPENTINE SHORT WORK IS MADE OF A
POPULACE OF LOUTS
THE HOSIER IN SPITE OF THE SIGNS MADE TO HIM BY GUILLAUME RYM APPEARED
DETERMINED TO HOLD HIS OWN AGAINST THE KING
SIRE THE SWISS WERE ALSO LOUTS
MONSIEUR THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY WAS A
GREAT GENTLEMAN AND HE TURNED UP HIS NOSE AT THAT RABBLE ROUT
AT THE
BATTLE OF GRANDSON SIRE HE CRIED 'MEN OF THE CANNON FIRE ON THE
VILLAINS AND HE SWORE BY SAINT GEORGE
BUT ADVOYER SCHARNACHTAL HURLED
HIMSELF ON THE HANDSOME DUKE WITH HIS BATTLE CLUB AND HIS PEOPLE AND
WHEN THE GLITTERING BURGUNDIAN ARMY CAME IN CONTACT WITH THESE PEASANTS
IN BULL HIDES IT FLEW IN PIECES LIKE A PANE OF GLASS AT THE BLOW OF A
PEBBLE
MANY LORDS WERE THEN SLAIN BY LOW BORN KNAVES AND MONSIEUR DE
CHTEAU GUYON THE GREATEST SEIGNEUR IN BURGUNDY WAS FOUND DEAD WITH
HIS GRAY HORSE IN A LITTLE MARSH MEADOW
FRIEND RETURNED THE KING YOU ARE SPEAKING OF A BATTLE
THE QUESTION
HERE IS OF A MUTINY
AND I WILL GAIN THE UPPER HAND OF IT AS SOON AS IT
SHALL PLEASE ME TO FROWN
THE OTHER REPLIED INDIFFERENTLY
THAT MAY BE SIRE IN THAT CASE 'TIS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE'S HOUR HATH
NOT YET COME
GUILLAUME RYM CONSIDERED IT INCUMBENT ON HIM TO INTERVENE
MASTER COPPENOLE YOU ARE SPEAKING TO A PUISSANT KING
I KNOW IT REPLIED THE HOSIER GRAVELY
LET HIM SPEAK MONSIEUR RYM MY FRIEND SAID THE KING I LOVE THIS
FRANKNESS OF SPEECH
MY FATHER CHARLES THE SEVENTH WAS ACCUSTOMED
TO SAY THAT THE TRUTH WAS AILING I THOUGHT HER DEAD AND THAT SHE HAD
FOUND NO CONFESSOR
MASTER COPPENOLE UNDECEIVETH ME
THEN LAYING HIS HAND FAMILIARLY ON COPPENOLE'S SHOULDER
YOU WERE SAYING MASTER JACQUES
I SAY SIRE THAT YOU MAY POSSIBLY BE IN THE RIGHT THAT THE HOUR OF
THE PEOPLE MAY NOT YET HAVE COME WITH YOU
LOUIS XI
GAZED AT HIM WITH HIS PENETRATING EYE
AND WHEN WILL THAT HOUR COME MASTER
YOU WILL HEAR IT STRIKE
ON WHAT CLOCK IF YOU PLEASE
COPPENOLE WITH HIS TRANQUIL AND RUSTIC COUNTENANCE MADE THE KING
APPROACH THE WINDOW
LISTEN SIRE THERE IS HERE A DONJON KEEP A BELFRY CANNONS
BOURGEOIS SOLDIERS WHEN THE BELFRY SHALL HUM WHEN THE CANNONS
SHALL ROAR WHEN THE DONJON SHALL FALL IN RUINS AMID GREAT NOISE WHEN
BOURGEOIS AND SOLDIERS SHALL HOWL AND SLAY EACH OTHER THE HOUR WILL
STRIKE
LOUIS'S FACE GREW SOMBRE AND DREAMY
HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT
THEN HE GENTLY PATTED WITH HIS HAND THE THICK WALL OF THE DONJON AS ONE
STROKES THE HAUNCHES OF A STEED
OH NO SAID HE
YOU WILL NOT CRUMBLE SO EASILY WILL YOU MY GOOD
BASTILLE
AND TURNING WITH AN ABRUPT GESTURE TOWARDS THE STURDY FLEMING
HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN A REVOLT MASTER JACQUES
I HAVE MADE THEM SAID THE HOSIER
HOW DO YOU SET TO WORK TO MAKE A REVOLT SAID THE KING
AH REPLIED COPPENOLE 'TIS NOT VERY DIFFICULT
THERE ARE A HUNDRED
WAYS
IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE MUST BE DISCONTENT IN THE CITY
THE
THING IS NOT UNCOMMON
AND THEN THE CHARACTER OF THE INHABITANTS
THOSE
OF GHENT ARE EASY TO STIR INTO REVOLT
THEY ALWAYS LOVE THE PRINCE'S
SON THE PRINCE NEVER
WELL ONE MORNING I WILL SUPPOSE SOME ONE
ENTERS MY SHOP AND SAYS TO ME 'FATHER COPPENOLE THERE IS THIS AND
THERE IS THAT THE DEMOISELLE OF FLANDERS WISHES TO SAVE HER MINISTERS
THE GRAND BAILIFF IS DOUBLING THE IMPOST ON SHAGREEN OR SOMETHING
ELSE WHAT YOU WILL
I LEAVE MY WORK AS IT STANDS I COME OUT OF MY
HOSIER'S STALL AND I SHOUT 'TO THE SACK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME SMASHED
CASK AT HAND
I MOUNT IT AND I SAY ALOUD IN THE FIRST WORDS THAT OCCUR
TO ME WHAT I HAVE ON MY HEART AND WHEN ONE IS OF THE PEOPLE SIRE
ONE ALWAYS HAS SOMETHING ON THE HEART THEN PEOPLE TROOP UP THEY SHOUT
THEY RING THE ALARM BELL THEY ARM THE LOUTS WITH WHAT THEY TAKE FROM
THE SOLDIERS THE MARKET PEOPLE JOIN IN AND THEY SET OUT
AND IT WILL
ALWAYS BE THUS SO LONG AS THERE ARE LORDS IN THE SEIGNORIES BOURGEOIS
IN THE BOURGS AND PEASANTS IN THE COUNTRY
AND AGAINST WHOM DO YOU THUS REBEL INQUIRED THE KING AGAINST YOUR
BAILIFFS AGAINST YOUR LORDS
SOMETIMES THAT DEPENDS
AGAINST THE DUKE ALSO SOMETIMES
LOUIS XI
RETURNED AND SEATED HIMSELF SAYING WITH A SMILE
AH HERE THEY HAVE ONLY GOT AS FAR AS THE BAILIFFS
AT THAT INSTANT OLIVIER LE DAIM RETURNED
HE WAS FOLLOWED BY TWO PAGES
WHO BORE THE KING'S TOILET ARTICLES BUT WHAT STRUCK LOUIS XI
WAS THAT
HE WAS ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY THE PROVOST OF PARIS AND THE CHEVALIER OF
THE WATCH WHO APPEARED TO BE IN CONSTERNATION
THE SPITEFUL BARBER
ALSO WORE AN AIR OF CONSTERNATION WHICH WAS ONE OF CONTENTMENT BENEATH
HOWEVER
IT WAS HE WHO SPOKE FIRST
SIRE I ASK YOUR MAJESTY'S PARDON FOR THE CALAMITOUS NEWS WHICH I
BRING
THE KING TURNED QUICKLY AND GRAZED THE MAT ON THE FLOOR WITH THE FEET OF
HIS CHAIR
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
SIRE RESUMED OLIVIER LE DAIM WITH THE MALICIOUS AIR OF A MAN WHO
REJOICES THAT HE IS ABOUT TO DEAL A VIOLENT BLOW 'TIS NOT AGAINST THE
BAILIFF OF THE COURTS THAT THIS POPULAR SEDITION IS DIRECTED
AGAINST WHOM THEN
AGAINST YOU SIRE
THE AGED KING ROSE ERECT AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG MAN
EXPLAIN YOURSELF OLIVIER AND GUARD YOUR HEAD WELL GOSSIP FOR I
SWEAR TO YOU BY THE CROSS OF SAINT L THAT IF YOU LIE TO US AT THIS
HOUR THE SWORD WHICH SEVERED THE HEAD OF MONSIEUR DE LUXEMBOURG IS NOT
SO NOTCHED THAT IT CANNOT YET SEVER YOURS
THE OATH WAS FORMIDABLE LOUIS XI
HAD ONLY SWORN TWICE IN THE COURSE OF
HIS LIFE BY THE CROSS OF SAINT L
OLIVIER OPENED HIS MOUTH TO REPLY
SIRE
ON YOUR KNEES INTERRUPTED THE KING VIOLENTLY
TRISTAN HAVE AN EYE
TO THIS MAN
OLIVIER KNELT DOWN AND SAID COLDLY
SIRE A SORCERESS WAS CONDEMNED TO DEATH BY YOUR COURT OF PARLIAMENT
SHE TOOK REFUGE IN NOTRE DAME
THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO TAKE HER FROM
THENCE BY MAIN FORCE
MONSIEUR THE PROVOST AND MONSIEUR THE CHEVALIER OF
THE WATCH WHO HAVE JUST COME FROM THE RIOT ARE HERE TO GIVE ME THE LIE
IF THIS IS NOT THE TRUTH
THE POPULACE IS BESIEGING NOTRE DAME
YES INDEED SAID THE KING IN A LOW VOICE ALL PALE AND TREMBLING WITH
WRATH
NOTRE DAME THEY LAY SIEGE TO OUR LADY MY GOOD MISTRESS IN
HER CATHEDRAL RISE OLIVIER
YOU ARE RIGHT
I GIVE YOU SIMON RADIN'S
CHARGE
YOU ARE RIGHT
'TIS I WHOM THEY ARE ATTACKING
THE WITCH IS
UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THIS CHURCH THE CHURCH IS UNDER MY PROTECTION
AND I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE ACTING AGAINST THE BAILIFF 'TIS AGAINST
MYSELF
THEN RENDERED YOUNG BY FURY HE BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN WITH LONG
STRIDES
HE NO LONGER LAUGHED HE WAS TERRIBLE HE WENT AND CAME THE
FOX WAS CHANGED INTO A HYAENA
HE SEEMED SUFFOCATED TO SUCH A DEGREE
THAT HE COULD NOT SPEAK HIS LIPS MOVED AND HIS FLESHLESS FISTS WERE
CLENCHED
ALL AT ONCE HE RAISED HIS HEAD HIS HOLLOW EYE APPEARED FULL
OF LIGHT AND HIS VOICE BURST FORTH LIKE A CLARION DOWN WITH THEM
TRISTAN A HEAVY HAND FOR THESE RASCALS GO TRISTAN MY FRIEND SLAY
SLAY
THIS ERUPTION HAVING PASSED HE RETURNED TO HIS SEAT AND SAID WITH COLD
AND CONCENTRATED WRATH

THEM

COMMONWEALTH EXTERMINATE TRISTAN EXTERMINATE AND LET NOT A SINGLE
ONE ESCAPE EXCEPT IT BE FOR MONTFAUON
TRISTAN BOWED
'TIS WELL SIRE
HE ADDED AFTER A SILENCE AND WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE SORCERESS
THIS QUESTION CAUSED THE KING TO MEDITATE
AH SAID HE THE SORCERESS MONSIEUR D'ESTOUTEVILLE WHAT DID THE
PEOPLE WISH TO DO WITH HER
SIRE REPLIED THE PROVOST OF PARIS I IMAGINE THAT SINCE THE POPULACE
HAS COME TO TEAR HER FROM HER ASYLUM IN NOTRE DAME 'TIS BECAUSE THAT
IMPUNITY WOUNDS THEM AND THEY DESIRE TO HANG HER
THE KING APPEARED TO REFLECT DEEPLY THEN ADDRESSING TRISTAN L'HERMITE
WELL GOSSIP EXTERMINATE THE PEOPLE AND HANG THE SORCERESS
THAT'S IT SAID RYM IN A LOW TONE TO COPPENOLE PUNISH THE PEOPLE FOR
WILLING A THING AND THEN DO WHAT THEY WISH
ENOUGH SIRE REPLIED TRISTAN
IF THE SORCERESS IS STILL IN
NOTRE DAME MUST SHE BE SEIZED IN SPITE OF THE SANCTUARY
PASQUE DIEU THE SANCTUARY SAID THE KING SCRATCHING HIS EAR
BUT
THE WOMAN MUST BE HUNG NEVERTHELESS
HERE AS THOUGH SEIZED WITH A SUDDEN IDEA HE FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES
BEFORE HIS CHAIR TOOK OFF HIS HAT PLACED IT ON THE SEAT AND GAZING
DEVOUTLY AT ONE OF THE LEADEN AMULETS WHICH LOADED IT DOWN OH SAID
HE WITH CLASPED HANDS OUR LADY OF PARIS MY GRACIOUS PATRONESS
PARDON ME
I WILL ONLY DO IT THIS ONCE
THIS CRIMINAL MUST BE PUNISHED
I ASSURE YOU MADAME THE VIRGIN MY GOOD MISTRESS THAT SHE IS A
SORCERESS WHO IS NOT WORTHY OF YOUR AMIABLE PROTECTION
YOU KNOW
MADAME THAT MANY VERY PIOUS PRINCES HAVE OVERSTEPPED THE PRIVILEGES
OF THE CHURCHES FOR THE GLORY OF GOD AND THE NECESSITIES OF THE STATE
SAINT HUGUES BISHOP OF ENGLAND PERMITTED KING EDWARD TO HANG A WITCH
IN HIS CHURCH
SAINT LOUIS OF FRANCE MY MASTER TRANSGRESSED WITH THE
SAME OBJECT THE CHURCH OF MONSIEUR SAINT PAUL AND MONSIEUR ALPHONSE
SON OF THE KING OF JERUSALEM THE VERY CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE
PARDON ME THEN FOR THIS ONCE
OUR LADY OF PARIS I WILL NEVER DO SO
AGAIN AND I WILL GIVE YOU A FINE STATUE OF SILVER LIKE THE ONE WHICH I
GAVE LAST YEAR TO OUR LADY OF ECOUYS
SO BE IT
HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ROSE DONNED HIS HAT ONCE MORE AND SAID
TO TRISTAN
BE DILIGENT GOSSIP
TAKE MONSIEUR CHTEAUPERS WITH YOU
YOU WILL CAUSE
THE TOCSIN TO BE SOUNDED

DONE BY YOU
YOU WILL RENDER ME AN ACCOUNT OF IT
COME OLIVIER I SHALL
NOT GO TO BED THIS NIGHT
SHAVE ME
TRISTAN L'HERMITE BOWED AND DEPARTED

COPPENOLE WITH A GESTURE
GOD GUARD YOU MESSIEURS MY GOOD FRIENDS THE FLEMINGS
GO TAKE A
LITTLE REPOSE
THE NIGHT ADVANCES AND WE ARE NEARER THE MORNING THAN
THE EVENING
BOTH RETIRED AND GAINED THEIR APARTMENTS UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE
CAPTAIN OF THE BASTILLE
COPPENOLE SAID TO GUILLAUME RYM
HUM I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT COUGHING KING I HAVE SEEN CHARLES OF
BURGUNDY DRUNK AND HE WAS LESS MALIGNANT THAN LOUIS XI
WHEN AILING
MASTER JACQUES REPLIED RYM 'TIS BECAUSE WINE RENDERS KINGS LESS
CRUEL THAN DOES BARLEY WATER
CHAPTER VI
LITTLE SWORD IN POCKET
ON EMERGING FROM THE BASTILLE GRINGOIRE DESCENDED THE RUE SAINT ANTOINE
WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF A RUNAWAY HORSE
ON ARRIVING AT THE BAUDOYER GATE
HE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE STONE CROSS WHICH ROSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT
PLACE AS THOUGH HE WERE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH IN THE DARKNESS THE FIGURE
OF A MAN CLAD AND CLOAKED IN BLACK WHO WAS SEATED ON THE STEPS OF THE
CROSS
IS IT YOU MASTER SAID GRINGOIRE
THE PERSONAGE IN BLACK ROSE
DEATH AND PASSION YOU MAKE ME BOIL GRINGOIRE
THE MAN ON THE TOWER OF
SAINT GERVAIS HAS JUST CRIED HALF PAST ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
OH RETORTED GRINGOIRE 'TIS NO FAULT OF MINE BUT OF THE WATCH AND
THE KING

I ALWAYS JUST MISS BEING
HUNG

PASSWORD
FANCY MASTER I HAVE SEEN THE KING

BREECHES

OH DISTAFF OF WORDS WHAT IS YOUR ADVENTURE TO ME HAVE YOU THE
PASSWORD OF THE OUTCASTS
I HAVE IT

'LITTLE SWORD IN POCKET
GOOD
OTHERWISE WE COULD NOT MAKE OUR WAY AS FAR AS THE CHURCH
THE OUTCASTS BAR THE STREETS
FORTUNATELY IT APPEARS THAT THEY HAVE
ENCOUNTERED RESISTANCE
WE MAY STILL ARRIVE IN TIME
YES MASTER BUT HOW ARE WE TO GET INTO NOTRE DAME
I HAVE THE KEY TO THE TOWER
AND HOW ARE WE TO GET OUT AGAIN
BEHIND THE CLOISTER THERE IS A LITTLE DOOR WHICH OPENS ON THE TERRAIN
AND THE WATER
I HAVE TAKEN THE KEY TO IT AND I MOORED A BOAT THERE
THIS MORNING
I HAVE HAD A BEAUTIFUL ESCAPE FROM BEING HUNG GRINGOIRE REPEATED
EH QUICK COME SAID THE OTHER
BOTH DESCENDED TOWARDS THE CITY WITH LONG STRIDES
CHAPTER VII
CHATEAUPERS TO THE RESCUE
THE READER WILL PERHAPS RECALL THE CRITICAL SITUATION IN WHICH WE LEFT
QUASIMODO
THE BRAVE DEAF MAN ASSAILED ON ALL SIDES HAD LOST IF
NOT ALL COURAGE AT LEAST ALL HOPE OF SAVING NOT HIMSELF HE WAS NOT
THINKING OF HIMSELF BUT THE GYPSY
HE RAN DISTRACTEDLY ALONG THE
GALLERY
NOTRE DAME WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING TAKEN BY STORM BY
THE OUTCASTS
ALL AT ONCE A GREAT GALLOPING OF HORSES FILLED THE
NEIGHBORING STREETS AND WITH A LONG FILE OF TORCHES AND A THICK COLUMN
OF CAVALIERS WITH FREE REINS AND LANCES IN REST THESE FURIOUS SOUNDS
DEBOUCHED ON THE PLACE LIKE A HURRICANE
FRANCE FRANCE CUT DOWN THE LOUTS CHTEAUPERS TO THE RESCUE
PROVOSTSHIP PROVOSTSHIP
THE FRIGHTENED VAGABONDS WHEELED ROUND
QUASIMODO WHO DID NOT HEAR SAW THE NAKED SWORDS THE TORCHES THE
IRONS OF THE PIKES ALL THAT CAVALRY AT THE HEAD OF WHICH HE RECOGNIZED
CAPTAIN PHOEBUS HE BEHELD THE CONFUSION OF THE OUTCASTS THE TERROR
OF SOME THE DISTURBANCE AMONG THE BRAVEST OF THEM AND FROM THIS
UNEXPECTED SUCCOR HE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH THAT HE HURLED FROM THE
CHURCH THE FIRST ASSAILANTS WHO WERE ALREADY CLIMBING INTO THE GALLERY
IT WAS IN FACT THE KING'S TROOPS WHO HAD ARRIVED
THE VAGABONDS
BEHAVED BRAVELY
THEY DEFENDED THEMSELVES LIKE DESPERATE MEN
CAUGHT ON
THE FLANK BY THE RUE SAINT PIERRE AUX BOEUFS AND IN THE REAR THROUGH
THE RUE DU PARVIS DRIVEN TO BAY AGAINST NOTRE DAME WHICH THEY
STILL ASSAILED AND QUASIMODO DEFENDED AT THE SAME TIME BESIEGERS AND
BESIEGED THEY WERE IN THE SINGULAR SITUATION IN WHICH COMTE HENRI
HARCOURT TAURINUM OBSESSOR IDEM ET OBSESSUS AS HIS EPITAPH SAYS
FOUND HIMSELF LATER ON AT THE FAMOUS SIEGE OF TURIN IN 1640 BETWEEN
PRINCE THOMAS OF SAVOY WHOM HE WAS BESIEGING AND THE MARQUIS DE
LEGANEZ WHO WAS BLOCKADING HIM
THE BATTLE WAS FRIGHTFUL
THERE WAS A DOG'S TOOTH FOR WOLF'S FLESH
AS P
MATHIEU SAYS
THE KING'S CAVALIERS IN WHOSE MIDST PHOEBUS DE
CHTEAUPERS BORE HIMSELF VALIANTLY GAVE NO QUARTER AND THE SLASH OF
THE SWORD DISPOSED OF THOSE WHO ESCAPED THE THRUST OF THE LANCE
THE
OUTCASTS BADLY ARMED FOAMED AND BIT WITH RAGE
MEN WOMEN CHILDREN
HURLED THEMSELVES ON THE CRUPPERS AND THE BREASTS OF THE HORSES AND
HUNG THERE LIKE CATS WITH TEETH FINGER NAILS AND TOE NAILS
OTHERS
STRUCK THE ARCHERS' IN THE FACE WITH THEIR TORCHES
OTHERS THRUST
IRON HOOKS INTO THE NECKS OF THE CAVALIERS AND DRAGGED THEM DOWN
THEY
SLASHED IN PIECES THOSE WHO FELL
ONE WAS NOTICED WHO HAD A LARGE GLITTERING SCYTHE AND WHO FOR A LONG
TIME MOWED THE LEGS OF THE HORSES
HE WAS FRIGHTFUL
HE WAS SINGING
A DITTY WITH A NASAL INTONATION HE SWUNG AND DREW BACK HIS SCYTHE
INCESSANTLY
AT EVERY BLOW HE TRACED AROUND HIM A GREAT CIRCLE OF
SEVERED LIMBS
HE ADVANCED THUS INTO THE VERY THICKEST OF THE CAVALRY
WITH THE TRANQUIL SLOWNESS THE LOLLING OF THE HEAD AND THE REGULAR
BREATHING OF A HARVESTER ATTACKING A FIELD OF WHEAT
IT WAS CHOPIN
TROUILLEFOU
A SHOT FROM AN ARQUEBUS LAID HIM LOW
IN THE MEANTIME WINDOWS HAD BEEN OPENED AGAIN
THE NEIGHBORS HEARING
THE WAR CRIES OF THE KING'S TROOPS HAD MINGLED IN THE AFFRAY AND
BULLETS RAINED UPON THE OUTCASTS FROM EVERY STORY
THE PARVIS WAS FILLED
WITH A THICK SMOKE WHICH THE MUSKETRY STREAKED WITH FLAME
THROUGH
IT ONE COULD CONFUSEDLY DISTINGUISH THE FRONT OF NOTRE DAME AND THE
DECREPIT HTEL DIEU WITH SOME WAN INVALIDS GAZING DOWN FROM THE HEIGHTS
OF ITS ROOF ALL CHECKERED WITH DORMER WINDOWS
AT LENGTH THE VAGABONDS GAVE WAY
WEARINESS THE LACK OF GOOD WEAPONS
THE FRIGHT OF THIS SURPRISE THE MUSKETRY FROM THE WINDOWS THE VALIANT
ATTACK OF THE KING'S TROOPS ALL OVERWHELMED THEM
THEY FORCED THE
LINE OF ASSAILANTS AND FLED IN EVERY DIRECTION LEAVING THE PARVIS
ENCUMBERED WITH DEAD
WHEN QUASIMODO WHO HAD NOT CEASED TO FIGHT FOR A MOMENT BEHELD
THIS ROUT HE FELL ON HIS KNEES AND RAISED HIS HANDS TO HEAVEN THEN
INTOXICATED WITH JOY HE RAN HE ASCENDED WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF A BIRD
TO THAT CELL THE APPROACHES TO WHICH HE HAD SO INTREPIDLY DEFENDED
HE HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT NOW IT WAS TO KNEEL BEFORE HER WHOM HE HAD JUST
SAVED FOR THE SECOND TIME
WHEN HE ENTERED THE CELL HE FOUND IT EMPTY
BOOK ELEVENTH
CHAPTER I
THE LITTLE SHOE
LA ESMERALDA WAS SLEEPING AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE OUTCASTS ASSAILED THE
CHURCH
SOON THE EVER INCREASING UPROAR AROUND THE EDIFICE AND THE UNEASY
BLEATING OF HER GOAT WHICH HAD BEEN AWAKENED HAD ROUSED HER FROM
HER SLUMBERS
SHE HAD SAT UP SHE HAD LISTENED SHE HAD LOOKED THEN
TERRIFIED BY THE LIGHT AND NOISE SHE HAD RUSHED FROM HER CELL TO SEE
THE ASPECT OF THE PLACE THE VISION WHICH WAS MOVING IN IT THE DISORDER
OF THAT NOCTURNAL ASSAULT THAT HIDEOUS CROWD LEAPING LIKE A CLOUD OF
FROGS HALF SEEN IN THE GLOOM THE CROAKING OF THAT HOARSE MULTITUDE
THOSE FEW RED TORCHES RUNNING AND CROSSING EACH OTHER IN THE DARKNESS
LIKE THE METEORS WHICH STREAK THE MISTY SURFACES OF MARSHES THIS WHOLE
SCENE PRODUCED UPON HER THE EFFECT OF A MYSTERIOUS BATTLE BETWEEN THE
PHANTOMS OF THE WITCHES' SABBATH AND THE STONE MONSTERS OF THE CHURCH
IMBUED FROM HER VERY INFANCY WITH THE SUPERSTITIONS OF THE BOHEMIAN
TRIBE HER FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT SHE HAD CAUGHT THE STRANGE BEINGS
PECULIAR TO THE NIGHT IN THEIR DEEDS OF WITCHCRAFT
THEN SHE RAN IN
TERROR TO COWER IN HER CELL ASKING OF HER PALLET SOME LESS TERRIBLE
NIGHTMARE
BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE FIRST VAPORS OF TERROR HAD BEEN DISSIPATED
FROM THE CONSTANTLY INCREASING NOISE AND FROM MANY OTHER SIGNS OF
REALITY SHE FELT HERSELF BESIEGED NOT BY SPECTRES BUT BY HUMAN BEINGS
THEN HER FEAR THOUGH IT DID NOT INCREASE CHANGED ITS CHARACTER
SHE
HAD DREAMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF A POPULAR MUTINY TO TEAR HER FROM HER
ASYLUM
THE IDEA OF ONCE MORE RECOVERING LIFE HOPE PHOEBUS WHO WAS
EVER PRESENT IN HER FUTURE THE EXTREME HELPLESSNESS OF HER CONDITION
FLIGHT CUT OFF NO SUPPORT HER ABANDONMENT HER ISOLATION THESE
THOUGHTS AND A THOUSAND OTHERS OVERWHELMED HER
SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES
WITH HER HEAD ON HER BED HER HANDS CLASPED OVER HER HEAD FULL OF
ANXIETY AND TREMORS AND ALTHOUGH A GYPSY AN IDOLATER AND A PAGAN
SHE BEGAN TO ENTREAT WITH SOBS MERCY FROM THE GOOD CHRISTIAN GOD AND
TO PRAY TO OUR LADY HER HOSTESS
FOR EVEN IF ONE BELIEVES IN NOTHING
THERE ARE MOMENTS IN LIFE WHEN ONE IS ALWAYS OF THE RELIGION OF THE
TEMPLE WHICH IS NEAREST AT HAND
SHE REMAINED THUS PROSTRATE FOR A VERY LONG TIME TREMBLING IN TRUTH
MORE THAN PRAYING CHILLED BY THE EVER CLOSER BREATH OF THAT FURIOUS
MULTITUDE UNDERSTANDING NOTHING OF THIS OUTBURST IGNORANT OF WHAT WAS
BEING PLOTTED WHAT WAS BEING DONE WHAT THEY WANTED BUT FORESEEING A
TERRIBLE ISSUE
IN THE MIDST OF THIS ANGUISH SHE HEARD SOME ONE WALKING NEAR HER
SHE
TURNED ROUND
TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM CARRIED A LANTERN HAD JUST ENTERED
HER CELL
SHE UTTERED A FEEBLE CRY
FEAR NOTHING SAID A VOICE WHICH WAS NOT UNKNOWN TO HER IT IS I
WHO ARE YOU SHE ASKED
PIERRE GRINGOIRE
THIS NAME REASSURED HER
SHE RAISED HER EYES ONCE MORE AND RECOGNIZED
THE POET IN VERY FACT
BUT THERE STOOD BESIDE HIM A BLACK FIGURE VEILED
FROM HEAD TO FOOT WHICH STRUCK HER BY ITS SILENCE
OH CONTINUED GRINGOIRE IN A TONE OF REPROACH DJALI RECOGNIZED ME
BEFORE YOU
THE LITTLE GOAT HAD NOT IN FACT WAITED FOR GRINGOIRE TO ANNOUNCE HIS
NAME
NO SOONER HAD HE ENTERED THAN IT RUBBED ITSELF GENTLY AGAINST HIS
KNEES COVERING THE POET WITH CARESSES AND WITH WHITE HAIRS FOR IT WAS
SHEDDING ITS HAIR
GRINGOIRE RETURNED THE CARESSES
WHO IS THIS WITH YOU SAID THE GYPSY IN A LOW VOICE
BE AT EASE REPLIED GRINGOIRE
'TIS ONE OF MY FRIENDS THEN THE
PHILOSOPHER SETTING HIS LANTERN ON THE GROUND CROUCHED UPON THE STONES
AND EXCLAIMED ENTHUSIASTICALLY AS HE PRESSED DJALI IN HIS ARMS
OH 'TIS A GRACEFUL BEAST MORE CONSIDERABLE NO DOUBT FOR IT'S
NEATNESS THAN FOR ITS SIZE BUT INGENIOUS SUBTLE AND LETTERED AS A
GRAMMARIAN LET US SEE MY DJALI HAST THOU FORGOTTEN ANY OF THY PRETTY
TRICKS HOW DOES MASTER JACQUES CHARMOLUE
THE MAN IN BLACK DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO FINISH
HE APPROACHED GRINGOIRE
AND SHOOK HIM ROUGHLY BY THE SHOULDER
GRINGOIRE ROSE
'TIS TRUE SAID HE I FORGOT THAT WE ARE IN HASTE
BUT THAT IS NO
REASON MASTER FOR GETTING FURIOUS WITH PEOPLE IN THIS MANNER
MY DEAR
AND LOVELY CHILD YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER AND DJALI'S ALSO
THEY WANT
TO HANG YOU AGAIN
WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS AND WE HAVE COME TO SAVE YOU
FOLLOW US
IS IT TRUE SHE EXCLAIMED IN DISMAY
YES PERFECTLY TRUE
COME QUICKLY
I AM WILLING SHE STAMMERED
BUT WHY DOES NOT YOUR FRIEND SPEAK
AH SAID GRINGOIRE 'TIS BECAUSE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WERE FANTASTIC
PEOPLE WHO MADE HIM OF A TACITURN TEMPERAMENT
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CONTENT HERSELF WITH THIS EXPLANATION
GRINGOIRE TOOK
HER BY THE HAND HIS COMPANION PICKED UP THE LANTERN AND WALKED ON IN
FRONT
FEAR STUNNED THE YOUNG GIRL
SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE LED AWAY
THE GOAT FOLLOWED THEM FRISKING SO JOYOUS AT SEEING GRINGOIRE AGAIN
THAT IT MADE HIM STUMBLE EVERY MOMENT BY THRUSTING ITS HORNS BETWEEN HIS
LEGS
SUCH IS LIFE SAID THE PHILOSOPHER EVERY TIME THAT HE CAME
NEAR FALLING DOWN 'TIS OFTEN OUR BEST FRIENDS WHO CAUSE US TO BE
OVERTHROWN
THEY RAPIDLY DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE OF THE TOWERS CROSSED THE CHURCH
FULL OF SHADOWS AND SOLITUDE AND ALL REVERBERATING WITH UPROAR WHICH
FORMED A FRIGHTFUL CONTRAST AND EMERGED INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE
CLOISTER BY THE RED DOOR
THE CLOISTER WAS DESERTED THE CANONS HAD
FLED TO THE BISHOP'S PALACE IN ORDER TO PRAY TOGETHER THE COURTYARD
WAS EMPTY A FEW FRIGHTENED LACKEYS WERE CROUCHING IN DARK CORNERS
THEY
DIRECTED THEIR STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR WHICH OPENED FROM THIS COURT UPON
THE TERRAIN
THE MAN IN BLACK OPENED IT WITH A KEY WHICH HE HAD ABOUT
HIM
OUR READERS ARE AWARE THAT THE TERRAIN WAS A TONGUE OF LAND
ENCLOSED BY WALLS ON THE SIDE OF THE CITY AND BELONGING TO THE CHAPTER
OF NOTRE DAME WHICH TERMINATED THE ISLAND ON THE EAST BEHIND THE
CHURCH
THEY FOUND THIS ENCLOSURE PERFECTLY DESERTED
THERE WAS HERE
LESS TUMULT IN THE AIR
THE ROAR OF THE OUTCASTS' ASSAULT REACHED THEM
MORE CONFUSEDLY AND LESS CLAMOROUSLY
THE FRESH BREEZE WHICH FOLLOWS THE
CURRENT OF A STREAM RUSTLED THE LEAVES OF THE ONLY TREE PLANTED ON THE
POINT OF THE TERRAIN WITH A NOISE THAT WAS ALREADY PERCEPTIBLE
BUT
THEY WERE STILL VERY CLOSE TO DANGER
THE NEAREST EDIFICES TO THEM WERE
THE BISHOP'S PALACE AND THE CHURCH
IT WAS PLAINLY EVIDENT THAT THERE
WAS GREAT INTERNAL COMMOTION IN THE BISHOP'S PALACE
ITS SHADOWY MASS
WAS ALL FURROWED WITH LIGHTS WHICH FLITTED FROM WINDOW TO WINDOW AS
WHEN ONE HAS JUST BURNED PAPER THERE REMAINS A SOMBRE EDIFICE OF ASHES
IN WHICH BRIGHT SPARKS RUN A THOUSAND ECCENTRIC COURSES
BESIDE THEM
THE ENORMOUS TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME THUS VIEWED FROM BEHIND WITH THE
LONG NAVE ABOVE WHICH THEY RISE CUT OUT IN BLACK AGAINST THE RED AND
VAST LIGHT WHICH FILLED THE PARVIS RESEMBLED TWO GIGANTIC ANDIRONS OF
SOME CYCLOPEAN FIRE GRATE
WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN OF PARIS ON ALL SIDES WAVERED BEFORE THE EYE IN
A GLOOM MINGLED WITH LIGHT
REMBRANDT HAS SUCH BACKGROUNDS TO HIS
PICTURES
THE MAN WITH THE LANTERN WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE POINT OF THE TERRAIN
THERE AT THE VERY BRINK OF THE WATER STOOD THE WORMEATEN REMAINS OF A
FENCE OF POSTS LATTICED WITH LATHS WHEREON A LOW VINE SPREAD OUT A
FEW THIN BRANCHES LIKE THE FINGERS OF AN OUTSPREAD HAND
BEHIND IN THE
SHADOW CAST BY THIS TRELLIS A LITTLE BOAT LAY CONCEALED
THE MAN MADE
A SIGN TO GRINGOIRE AND HIS COMPANION TO ENTER
THE GOAT FOLLOWED THEM
THE MAN WAS THE LAST TO STEP IN
THEN HE CUT THE BOAT'S MOORINGS PUSHED
IT FROM THE SHORE WITH A LONG BOAT HOOK AND SEIZING TWO OARS SEATED
HIMSELF IN THE BOW ROWING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TOWARDS MIDSTREAM
THE
SEINE IS VERY RAPID AT THIS POINT AND HE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE IN
LEAVING THE POINT OF THE ISLAND
GRINGOIRE'S FIRST CARE ON ENTERING THE BOAT WAS TO PLACE THE GOAT ON
HIS KNEES
HE TOOK A POSITION IN THE STERN AND THE YOUNG GIRL WHOM THE
STRANGER INSPIRED WITH AN INDEFINABLE UNEASINESS SEATED HERSELF CLOSE
TO THE POET
WHEN OUR PHILOSOPHER FELT THE BOAT SWAY HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND KISSED
DJALI BETWEEN THE HORNS
OH SAID HE NOW WE ARE SAFE ALL FOUR OF US
HE ADDED WITH THE AIR OF A PROFOUND THINKER ONE IS INDEBTED
SOMETIMES TO FORTUNE SOMETIMES TO RUSE FOR THE HAPPY ISSUE OF GREAT
ENTERPRISES
THE BOAT MADE ITS WAY SLOWLY TOWARDS THE RIGHT SHORE
THE YOUNG GIRL
WATCHED THE UNKNOWN MAN WITH SECRET TERROR
HE HAD CAREFULLY TURNED OFF
THE LIGHT OF HIS DARK LANTERN
A GLIMPSE COULD BE CAUGHT OF HIM IN THE
OBSCURITY IN THE BOW OF THE BOAT LIKE A SPECTRE
HIS COWL WHICH WAS
STILL LOWERED FORMED A SORT OF MASK AND EVERY TIME THAT HE SPREAD HIS
ARMS UPON WHICH HUNG LARGE BLACK SLEEVES AS HE ROWED ONE WOULD HAVE
SAID THEY WERE TWO HUGE BAT'S WINGS
MOREOVER HE HAD NOT YET UTTERED A
WORD OR BREATHED A SYLLABLE
NO OTHER NOISE WAS HEARD IN THE BOAT THAN
THE SPLASHING OF THE OARS MINGLED WITH THE RIPPLING OF THE WATER ALONG
HER SIDES
ON MY SOUL EXCLAIMED GRINGOIRE SUDDENLY WE ARE AS CHEERFUL AND
JOYOUS AS YOUNG OWLS WE PRESERVE THE SILENCE OF PYTHAGOREANS OR FISHES
PASQUE DIEU MY FRIENDS I SHOULD GREATLY LIKE TO HAVE SOME ONE SPEAK
TO ME
THE HUMAN VOICE IS MUSIC TO THE HUMAN EAR
'TIS NOT I WHO
SAY THAT BUT DIDYMUS OF ALEXANDRIA AND THEY ARE ILLUSTRIOUS WORDS
ASSUREDLY DIDYMUS OF ALEXANDRIA IS NO MEDIOCRE PHILOSOPHER ONE WORD
MY LOVELY CHILD SAY BUT ONE WORD TO ME I ENTREAT YOU
BY THE WAY YOU
HAD A DROLL AND PECULIAR LITTLE POUT DO YOU STILL MAKE IT DO YOU
KNOW MY DEAR THAT PARLIAMENT HATH FULL JURISDICTION OVER ALL PLACES OF
ASYLUM AND THAT YOU WERE RUNNING A GREAT RISK IN YOUR LITTLE CHAMBER AT
NOTRE DAME ALAS THE LITTLE BIRD TROCHYLUS MAKETH ITS NEST IN THE JAWS
OF THE CROCODILE MASTER HERE IS THE MOON RE APPEARING
IF ONLY
THEY DO NOT PERCEIVE US
WE ARE DOING A LAUDABLE THING IN SAVING
MADEMOISELLE AND YET WE SHOULD BE HUNG BY ORDER OF THE KING IF WE WERE
CAUGHT
ALAS HUMAN ACTIONS ARE TAKEN BY TWO HANDLES
THAT IS BRANDED
WITH DISGRACE IN ONE WHICH IS CROWNED IN ANOTHER
HE ADMIRES CICERO WHO
BLAMES CATILINE
IS IT NOT SO MASTER WHAT SAY YOU TO THIS
PHILOSOPHY I POSSESS PHILOSOPHY BY INSTINCT BY NATURE UT APES
GEOMETRIAM COME NO ONE ANSWERS ME
WHAT UNPLEASANT MOODS YOU TWO ARE
IN I MUST DO ALL THE TALKING ALONE
THAT IS WHAT WE CALL A MONOLOGUE
IN TRAGEDY PASQUE DIEU I MUST INFORM YOU THAT I HAVE JUST SEEN
THE KING LOUIS XI AND THAT I HAVE CAUGHT THIS OATH FROM
HIM PASQUE DIEU THEY ARE STILL MAKING A HEARTY HOWL IN THE
CITY 'TIS A VILLANOUS MALICIOUS OLD KING
HE IS ALL SWATHED IN FURS
HE STILL OWES ME THE MONEY FOR MY EPITHALAMIUM AND HE CAME WITHIN A
NICK OF HANGING ME THIS EVENING WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INCONVENIENT
TO ME HE IS NIGGARDLY TOWARDS MEN OF MERIT
HE OUGHT TO READ THE FOUR
BOOKS OF SALVIEN OF COLOGNE ADVERSITS AVARITIAM
IN TRUTH 'TIS A
PALTRY KING IN HIS WAYS WITH MEN OF LETTERS AND ONE WHO COMMITS VERY
BARBAROUS CRUELTIES
HE IS A SPONGE TO SOAK MONEY RAISED FROM THE
PEOPLE
HIS SAVING IS LIKE THE SPLEEN WHICH SWELLETH WITH THE LEANNESS
OF ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS
HENCE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE HARDNESS OF THE
TIMES BECOME MURMURS AGAINST THE PRINCE
UNDER THIS GENTLE AND PIOUS
SIRE THE GALLOWS CRACK WITH THE HUNG THE BLOCKS ROT WITH BLOOD THE
PRISONS BURST LIKE OVER FULL BELLIES
THIS KING HATH ONE HAND WHICH
GRASPS AND ONE WHICH HANGS
HE IS THE PROCURATOR OF DAME TAX AND
MONSIEUR GIBBET
THE GREAT ARE DESPOILED OF THEIR DIGNITIES AND
THE LITTLE INCESSANTLY OVERWHELMED WITH FRESH OPPRESSIONS
HE IS AN
EXORBITANT PRINCE
I LOVE NOT THIS MONARCH
AND YOU MASTER
THE MAN IN BLACK LET THE GARRULOUS POET CHATTER ON
HE CONTINUED TO
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE VIOLENT AND NARROW CURRENT WHICH SEPARATES THE
PROW OF THE CITY AND THE STEM OF THE ISLAND OF NOTRE DAME WHICH WE CALL
TO DAY THE ISLE ST
LOUIS
BY THE WAY MASTER CONTINUED GRINGOIRE SUDDENLY
AT THE MOMENT
WHEN WE ARRIVED ON THE PARVIS THROUGH THE ENRAGED OUTCASTS DID YOUR
REVERENCE OBSERVE THAT POOR LITTLE DEVIL WHOSE SKULL YOUR DEAF MAN WAS
JUST CRACKING ON THE RAILING OF THE GALLERY OF THE KINGS I AM NEAR
SIGHTED AND I COULD NOT RECOGNIZE HIM
DO YOU KNOW WHO HE COULD BE
THE STRANGER ANSWERED NOT A WORD
BUT HE SUDDENLY CEASED ROWING
HIS ARMS FELL AS THOUGH BROKEN HIS HEAD SANK ON HIS BREAST AND LA
ESMERALDA HEARD HIM SIGH CONVULSIVELY
SHE SHUDDERED
SHE HAD HEARD SUCH
SIGHS BEFORE
THE BOAT ABANDONED TO ITSELF FLOATED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITH THE
STREAM
BUT THE MAN IN BLACK FINALLY RECOVERED HIMSELF SEIZED THE OARS
ONCE MORE AND BEGAN TO ROW AGAINST THE CURRENT
HE DOUBLED THE POINT OF
THE ISLE OF NOTRE DAME AND MADE FOR THE LANDING PLACE OF THE PORT AN
FOIN
AH SAID GRINGOIRE YONDER IS THE BARBEAU MANSION STAY MASTER
LOOK THAT GROUP OF BLACK ROOFS WHICH MAKE SUCH SINGULAR ANGLES YONDER
ABOVE THAT HEAP OF BLACK FIBROUS GRIMY DIRTY CLOUDS WHERE THE MOON IS
COMPLETELY CRUSHED AND SPREAD OUT LIKE THE YOLK OF AN EGG WHOSE SHELL
IS BROKEN 'TIS A FINE MANSION
THERE IS A CHAPEL CROWNED WITH A SMALL
VAULT FULL OF VERY WELL CARVED ENRICHMENTS
ABOVE YOU CAN SEE THE BELL
TOWER VERY DELICATELY PIERCED
THERE IS ALSO A PLEASANT GARDEN WHICH
CONSISTS OF A POND AN AVIARY AN ECHO A MALL A LABYRINTH A HOUSE
FOR WILD BEASTS AND A QUANTITY OF LEAFY ALLEYS VERY AGREEABLE TO VENUS
THERE IS ALSO A RASCAL OF A TREE WHICH IS CALLED 'THE LEWD BECAUSE IT
FAVORED THE PLEASURES OF A FAMOUS PRINCESS AND A CONSTABLE OF FRANCE
WHO WAS A GALLANT AND A WIT ALAS WE POOR PHILOSOPHERS ARE TO A
CONSTABLE AS A PLOT OF CABBAGES OR A RADISH BED TO THE GARDEN OF THE
LOUVRE
WHAT MATTERS IT AFTER ALL HUMAN LIFE FOR THE GREAT AS WELL
AS FOR US IS A MIXTURE OF GOOD AND EVIL
PAIN IS ALWAYS BY THE SIDE
OF JOY THE SPONDEE BY THE DACTYL MASTER I MUST RELATE TO YOU THE
HISTORY OF THE BARBEAU MANSION
IT ENDS IN TRAGIC FASHION
IT WAS IN
1319 IN THE REIGN OF PHILIPPE V THE LONGEST REIGN OF THE KINGS OF
FRANCE
THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS THAT THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE FLESH ARE
PERNICIOUS AND MALIGNANT
LET US NOT REST OUR GLANCE TOO LONG ON OUR
NEIGHBOR'S WIFE HOWEVER GRATIFIED OUR SENSES MAY BE BY HER BEAUTY
FORNICATION IS A VERY LIBERTINE THOUGHT
ADULTERY IS A PRYING INTO THE
PLEASURES OF OTHERS OH THE NOISE YONDER IS REDOUBLING
THE TUMULT AROUND NOTRE DAME WAS IN FACT INCREASING
THEY LISTENED
CRIES OF VICTORY WERE HEARD WITH TOLERABLE DISTINCTNESS
ALL AT ONCE A
HUNDRED TORCHES THE LIGHT OF WHICH GLITTERED UPON THE HELMETS OF MEN
AT ARMS SPREAD OVER THE CHURCH AT ALL HEIGHTS ON THE TOWERS ON THE
GALLERIES ON THE FLYING BUTTRESSES
THESE TORCHES SEEMED TO BE IN
SEARCH OF SOMETHING AND SOON DISTANT CLAMORS REACHED THE FUGITIVES
DISTINCTLY THE GYPSY THE SORCERESS DEATH TO THE GYPSY
THE UNHAPPY GIRL DROPPED HER HEAD UPON HER HANDS AND THE UNKNOWN BEGAN
TO ROW FURIOUSLY TOWARDS THE SHORE
MEANWHILE OUR PHILOSOPHER REFLECTED
HE CLASPED THE GOAT IN HIS ARMS AND GENTLY DREW AWAY FROM THE GYPSY
WHO PRESSED CLOSER AND CLOSER TO HIM AS THOUGH TO THE ONLY ASYLUM WHICH
REMAINED TO HER
IT IS CERTAIN THAT GRINGOIRE WAS ENDURING CRUEL PERPLEXITY
HE WAS
THINKING THAT THE GOAT ALSO ACCORDING TO EXISTING LAW WOULD BE HUNG
IF RECAPTURED WHICH WOULD BE A GREAT PITY POOR DJALI THAT HE HAD THUS
TWO CONDEMNED CREATURES ATTACHED TO HIM THAT HIS COMPANION ASKED NO
BETTER THAN TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE GYPSY
A VIOLENT COMBAT BEGAN BETWEEN
HIS THOUGHTS IN WHICH LIKE THE JUPITER OF THE ILIAD HE WEIGHED IN
TURN THE GYPSY AND THE GOAT AND HE LOOKED AT THEM ALTERNATELY WITH EYES
MOIST WITH TEARS SAYING BETWEEN HIS TEETH
BUT I CANNOT SAVE YOU BOTH
A SHOCK INFORMED THEM THAT THE BOAT HAD REACHED THE LAND AT LAST
THE
UPROAR STILL FILLED THE CITY
THE UNKNOWN ROSE APPROACHED THE GYPSY
AND ENDEAVORED TO TAKE HER ARM TO ASSIST HER TO ALIGHT
SHE REPULSED HIM
AND CLUNG TO THE SLEEVE OF GRINGOIRE WHO IN HIS TURN ABSORBED IN THE
GOAT ALMOST REPULSED HER
THEN SHE SPRANG ALONE FROM THE BOAT
SHE WAS
SO TROUBLED THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE DID OR WHITHER SHE WAS GOING
THUS SHE REMAINED FOR A MOMENT STUNNED WATCHING THE WATER FLOW PAST
WHEN SHE GRADUALLY RETURNED TO HER SENSES SHE FOUND HERSELF ALONE
ON THE WHARF WITH THE UNKNOWN
IT APPEARS THAT GRINGOIRE HAD TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF THE MOMENT OF DEBARCATION TO SLIP AWAY WITH THE GOAT INTO
THE BLOCK OF HOUSES OF THE RUE GRENIER SUR L'EAU
THE POOR GYPSY SHIVERED WHEN SHE BEHELD HERSELF ALONE WITH THIS MAN
SHE
TRIED TO SPEAK TO CRY OUT TO CALL GRINGOIRE HER TONGUE WAS DUMB
IN HER MOUTH AND NO SOUND LEFT HER LIPS
ALL AT ONCE SHE FELT
THE STRANGER'S HAND ON HERS
IT WAS A STRONG COLD HAND
HER TEETH
CHATTERED SHE TURNED PALER THAN THE RAY OF MOONLIGHT WHICH ILLUMINATED
HER
THE MAN SPOKE NOT A WORD
HE BEGAN TO ASCEND TOWARDS THE PLACE DE
GRVE HOLDING HER BY THE HAND
AT THAT MOMENT SHE HAD A VAGUE FEELING THAT DESTINY IS AN IRRESISTIBLE
FORCE
SHE HAD NO MORE RESISTANCE LEFT IN HER SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE
DRAGGED ALONG RUNNING WHILE HE WALKED
AT THIS SPOT THE QUAY ASCENDED
BUT IT SEEMED TO HER AS THOUGH SHE WERE DESCENDING A SLOPE
SHE GAZED ABOUT HER ON ALL SIDES
NOT A SINGLE PASSER BY
THE QUAY WAS
ABSOLUTELY DESERTED
SHE HEARD NO SOUND SHE FELT NO PEOPLE MOVING SAVE
IN THE TUMULTUOUS AND GLOWING CITY FROM WHICH SHE WAS SEPARATED ONLY BY
AN ARM OF THE SEINE AND WHENCE HER NAME REACHED HER MINGLED WITH CRIES
OF DEATH THE REST OF PARIS WAS SPREAD AROUND HER IN GREAT BLOCKS OF
SHADOWS
MEANWHILE THE STRANGER CONTINUED TO DRAG HER ALONG WITH THE SAME
SILENCE AND THE SAME RAPIDITY
SHE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF ANY OF THE
PLACES WHERE SHE WAS WALKING
AS SHE PASSED BEFORE A LIGHTED WINDOW SHE
MADE AN EFFORT DREW UP SUDDENLY AND CRIED OUT HELP
THE BOURGEOIS WHO WAS STANDING AT THE WINDOW OPENED IT APPEARED THERE
IN HIS SHIRT WITH HIS LAMP STARED AT THE QUAY WITH A STUPID AIR
UTTERED SOME WORDS WHICH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND CLOSED HIS SHUTTER
AGAIN
IT WAS HER LAST GLEAM OF HOPE EXTINGUISHED
THE MAN IN BLACK DID NOT UTTER A SYLLABLE HE HELD HER FIRMLY AND SET
OUT AGAIN AT A QUICKER PACE
SHE NO LONGER RESISTED BUT FOLLOWED HIM
COMPLETELY BROKEN
FROM TIME TO TIME SHE CALLED TOGETHER A LITTLE STRENGTH AND SAID IN A
VOICE BROKEN BY THE UNEVENNESS OF THE PAVEMENT AND THE BREATHLESSNESS OF
THEIR FLIGHT WHO ARE YOU WHO ARE YOU HE MADE NO REPLY
THEY ARRIVED THUS STILL KEEPING ALONG THE QUAY AT A TOLERABLY SPACIOUS
SQUARE
IT WAS THE GRVE
IN THE MIDDLE A SORT OF BLACK ERECT CROSS
WAS VISIBLE IT WAS THE GALLOWS
SHE RECOGNIZED ALL THIS AND SAW WHERE
SHE WAS
THE MAN HALTED TURNED TOWARDS HER AND RAISED HIS COWL
OH SHE STAMMERED ALMOST PETRIFIED I KNEW WELL THAT IT WAS HE
AGAIN
IT WAS THE PRIEST
HE LOOKED LIKE THE GHOST OF HIMSELF THAT IS AN
EFFECT OF THE MOONLIGHT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ONE BEHELD ONLY THE SPECTRES
OF THINGS IN THAT LIGHT
LISTEN HE SAID TO HER AND SHE SHUDDERED AT THE SOUND OF THAT FATAL
VOICE WHICH SHE HAD NOT HEARD FOR A LONG TIME
HE CONTINUED SPEAKING
WITH THOSE BRIEF AND PANTING JERKS WHICH BETOKEN DEEP INTERNAL
CONVULSIONS
LISTEN WE ARE HERE
I AM GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU
THIS IS
THE GRVE
THIS IS AN EXTREME POINT
DESTINY GIVES US TO ONE ANOTHER
I
AM GOING TO DECIDE AS TO YOUR LIFE YOU WILL DECIDE AS TO MY SOUL
HERE
IS A PLACE HERE IS A NIGHT BEYOND WHICH ONE SEES NOTHING
THEN LISTEN
TO ME
I AM GOING TO TELL YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE SPEAK NOT TO ME
OF YOUR PHOEBUS
AS HE SPOKE THUS HE PACED TO AND FRO LIKE A MAN WHO
CANNOT REMAIN IN ONE PLACE AND DRAGGED HER AFTER HIM DO NOT SPEAK TO
ME OF HIM
DO YOU SEE IF YOU UTTER THAT NAME I KNOW NOT WHAT I SHALL
DO BUT IT WILL BE TERRIBLE
THEN LIKE A BODY WHICH RECOVERS ITS CENTRE OF GRAVITY HE BECAME
MOTIONLESS ONCE MORE BUT HIS WORDS BETRAYED NO LESS AGITATION
HIS
VOICE GREW LOWER AND LOWER
DO NOT TURN YOUR HEAD ASIDE THUS
LISTEN TO ME
IT IS A SERIOUS MATTER
IN THE FIRST PLACE HERE IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED ALL THIS WILL NOT BE
LAUGHED AT
I SWEAR IT TO YOU WHAT WAS I SAYING REMIND ME OH THERE
IS A DECREE OF PARLIAMENT WHICH GIVES YOU BACK TO THE SCAFFOLD
I HAVE
JUST RESCUED YOU FROM THEIR HANDS
BUT THEY ARE PURSUING YOU
LOOK
HE EXTENDED HIS ARM TOWARD THE CITY
THE SEARCH SEEMED IN FACT TO
BE STILL IN PROGRESS THERE
THE UPROAR DREW NEARER THE TOWER OF THE
LIEUTENANT'S HOUSE SITUATED OPPOSITE THE GRVE WAS FULL OF CLAMORS
AND LIGHT AND SOLDIERS COULD BE SEEN RUNNING ON THE OPPOSITE QUAY WITH
TORCHES AND THESE CRIES THE GYPSY WHERE IS THE GYPSY DEATH DEATH
YOU SEE THAT THEY ARE IN PURSUIT OF YOU AND THAT I AM NOT LYING TO
YOU
I LOVE YOU DO NOT OPEN YOUR MOUTH REFRAIN FROM SPEAKING TO ME
RATHER IF IT BE ONLY TO TELL ME THAT YOU HATE ME
I HAVE MADE UP MY
MIND NOT TO HEAR THAT AGAIN I HAVE JUST SAVED YOU LET ME FINISH
FIRST
I CAN SAVE YOU WHOLLY
I HAVE PREPARED EVERYTHING
IT IS YOURS AT
WILL
IF YOU WISH I CAN DO IT
HE BROKE OFF VIOLENTLY
NO THAT IS NOT WHAT I SHOULD SAY
AS HE WENT WITH HURRIED STEP AND MADE HER HURRY ALSO FOR HE DID NOT
RELEASE HER HE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE GALLOWS AND POINTED TO IT WITH
HIS FINGER
CHOOSE BETWEEN US TWO HE SAID COLDLY
SHE TORE HERSELF FROM HIS HANDS AND FELL AT THE FOOT OF THE GIBBET
EMBRACING THAT FUNEREAL SUPPORT THEN SHE HALF TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL
HEAD AND LOOKED AT THE PRIEST OVER HER SHOULDER
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID
THAT SHE WAS A HOLY VIRGIN AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS
THE PRIEST REMAINED
MOTIONLESS HIS FINGER STILL RAISED TOWARD THE GIBBET PRESERVING HIS
ATTITUDE LIKE A STATUE
AT LENGTH THE GYPSY SAID TO HIM
IT CAUSES ME LESS HORROR THAN YOU DO
THEN HE ALLOWED HIS ARM TO SINK SLOWLY AND GAZED AT THE PAVEMENT IN
PROFOUND DEJECTION
IF THESE STONES COULD SPEAK HE MURMURED YES THEY WOULD SAY THAT A
VERY UNHAPPY MAN STANDS HERE
HE WENT ON
THE YOUNG GIRL KNEELING BEFORE THE GALLOWS ENVELOPED IN
HER LONG FLOWING HAIR LET HIM SPEAK ON WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
HE NOW HAD
A GENTLE AND PLAINTIVE ACCENT WHICH CONTRASTED SADLY WITH THE HAUGHTY
HARSHNESS OF HIS FEATURES
I LOVE YOU
OH HOW TRUE THAT IS SO NOTHING COMES OF THAT FIRE WHICH
BURNS MY HEART ALAS YOUNG GIRL NIGHT AND DAY YES NIGHT AND DAY I
TELL YOU IT IS TORTURE

BRINK OF ETERNITY FOR BOTH OF US ABOVE ALL THINGS DO NOT SPEAK TO ME
OF THE OFFICER I WOULD CAST MYSELF AT YOUR KNEES I WOULD KISS NOT

A CHILD I WOULD TEAR FROM MY BREAST NOT WORDS BUT MY VERY HEART AND

GOOD PITIFUL AND CHARMING
ALAS YOU CHERISH NO ILL WILL FOR ANY ONE
BUT ME ALONE OH WHAT A FATALITY
HE HID HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
THE YOUNG GIRL HEARD HIM WEEPING
IT WAS
FOR THE FIRST TIME
THUS ERECT AND SHAKEN BY SOBS HE WAS MORE
MISERABLE AND MORE SUPPLIANT THAN WHEN ON HIS KNEES
HE WEPT THUS FOR A
CONSIDERABLE TIME
COME HE SAID THESE FIRST TEARS PASSED I HAVE NO MORE WORDS
I HAD
HOWEVER THOUGHT WELL AS TO WHAT YOU WOULD SAY
NOW I TREMBLE AND SHIVER
AND BREAK DOWN AT THE DECISIVE MOMENT I FEEL CONSCIOUS OF SOMETHING
SUPREME ENVELOPING US AND I STAMMER

THIS FOR THEE ENCHANTRESS TO BE MORE WORTHY OF THY HELL AND YOU WILL
NOT HAVE THE APOSTATE OH LET ME TELL YOU ALL MORE STILL SOMETHING
MORE HORRIBLE OH YET MORE HORRIBLE
AS HE UTTERED THESE LAST WORDS HIS AIR BECAME UTTERLY DISTRACTED
HE
WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND RESUMED AS THOUGH SPEAKING TO HIMSELF AND
IN A STRONG VOICE
CAIN WHAT HAST THOU DONE WITH THY BROTHER
THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE AND HE WENT ON
WHAT HAVE I DONE WITH HIM LORD I RECEIVED HIM I REARED HIM I
NOURISHED HIM I LOVED HIM I IDOLIZED HIM AND I HAVE SLAIN HIM YES
LORD THEY HAVE JUST DASHED HIS HEAD BEFORE MY EYES ON THE STONE OF
THINE HOUSE AND IT IS BECAUSE OF ME BECAUSE OF THIS WOMAN BECAUSE OF
HER
HIS EYE WAS WILD
HIS VOICE GREW EVER WEAKER HE REPEATED MANY TIMES
YET MECHANICALLY AT TOLERABLY LONG INTERVALS LIKE A BELL PROLONGING
ITS LAST VIBRATION BECAUSE OF HER BECAUSE OF HER
THEN HIS TONGUE NO LONGER ARTICULATED ANY PERCEPTIBLE SOUND BUT
HIS LIPS STILL MOVED
ALL AT ONCE HE SANK TOGETHER LIKE SOMETHING
CRUMBLING AND LAY MOTIONLESS ON THE EARTH WITH HIS HEAD ON HIS KNEES
A TOUCH FROM THE YOUNG GIRL AS SHE DREW HER FOOT FROM UNDER HIM
BROUGHT HIM TO HIMSELF
HE PASSED HIS HAND SLOWLY OVER HIS HOLLOW
CHEEKS AND GAZED FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS AT HIS FINGERS WHICH WERE WET
WHAT HE MURMURED I HAVE WEPT
AND TURNING SUDDENLY TO THE GYPSY WITH UNSPEAKABLE ANGUISH
ALAS YOU HAVE LOOKED COLDLY ON AT MY TEARS CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT
THOSE TEARS ARE OF LAVA IS IT INDEED TRUE NOTHING TOUCHES WHEN IT
COMES FROM THE MAN WHOM ONE DOES NOT LOVE
IF YOU WERE TO SEE ME DIE
YOU WOULD LAUGH
OH I DO NOT WISH TO SEE YOU DIE ONE WORD A SINGLE
WORD OF PARDON SAY NOT THAT YOU LOVE ME SAY ONLY THAT YOU WILL DO IT
THAT WILL SUFFICE I WILL SAVE YOU
IF NOT OH THE HOUR IS PASSING
I
ENTREAT YOU BY ALL THAT IS SACRED DO NOT WAIT UNTIL I SHALL HAVE TURNED

TERRIBLE THAT I MAY LET ALL GO TO DESTRUCTION AND THAT THERE IS
BENEATH US A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS UNHAPPY GIRL WHITHER MY FALL WILL FOLLOW
YOURS TO ALL ETERNITY ONE WORD OF KINDNESS SAY ONE WORD ONLY ONE
WORD
SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO ANSWER HIM
HE FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES TO
RECEIVE WITH ADORATION THE WORD POSSIBLY A TENDER ONE WHICH WAS ON THE
POINT OF ISSUING FROM HER LIPS
SHE SAID TO HIM YOU ARE AN ASSASSIN
THE PRIEST CLASPED HER IN HIS ARMS WITH FURY AND BEGAN TO LAUGH WITH AN
ABOMINABLE LAUGH
WELL YES AN ASSASSIN HE SAID AND I WILL HAVE YOU

BEAUTY OR BE MINE BELONG TO THE PRIEST BELONG TO THE APOSTATE BELONG
TO THE ASSASSIN THIS VERY NIGHT DO YOU HEAR COME JOY KISS ME MAD
GIRL THE TOMB OR MY BED
HIS EYES SPARKLED WITH IMPURITY AND RAGE
HIS LEWD LIPS REDDENED THE
YOUNG GIRL'S NECK
SHE STRUGGLED IN HIS ARMS
HE COVERED HER WITH
FURIOUS KISSES
DO NOT BITE ME MONSTER SHE CRIED
OH THE FOUL ODIOUS MONK LEAVE

HANDFUL
HE REDDENED TURNED PALE THEN RELEASED HER AND GAZED AT HER WITH A
GLOOMY AIR
SHE THOUGHT HERSELF VICTORIOUS AND CONTINUED
I TELL YOU THAT I BELONG TO MY PHOEBUS THAT 'TIS PHOEBUS WHOM I LOVE
THAT 'TIS PHOEBUS WHO IS HANDSOME YOU ARE OLD PRIEST YOU ARE UGLY
BEGONE
HE GAVE VENT TO A HORRIBLE CRY LIKE THE WRETCH TO WHOM A HOT IRON IS
APPLIED

SHE SAW HIS TERRIBLE
LOOK AND TRIED TO FLY
HE CAUGHT HER ONCE MORE HE SHOOK HER HE FLUNG
HER ON THE GROUND AND WALKED WITH RAPID STRIDES TOWARDS THE CORNER
OF THE TOUR ROLAND DRAGGING HER AFTER HIM ALONG THE PAVEMENT BY HER
BEAUTIFUL HANDS
ON ARRIVING THERE HE TURNED TO HER
FOR THE LAST TIME WILL YOU BE MINE
SHE REPLIED WITH EMPHASIS
NO
THEN HE CRIED IN A LOUD VOICE
GUDULE GUDULE HERE IS THE GYPSY TAKE YOUR VENGEANCE
THE YOUNG GIRL FELT HERSELF SEIZED SUDDENLY BY THE ELBOW
SHE LOOKED
A FLESHLESS ARM WAS STRETCHED FROM AN OPENING IN THE WALL AND HELD HER
LIKE A HAND OF IRON
HOLD HER WELL SAID THE PRIEST 'TIS THE GYPSY ESCAPED
RELEASE HER
NOT
I WILL GO IN SEARCH OF THE SERGEANTS
YOU SHALL SEE HER HANGED
A GUTTURAL LAUGH REPLIED FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE WALL TO THESE BLOODY
WORDS HAH HAH HAH THE GYPSY WATCHED THE PRIEST RETIRE IN
THE DIRECTION OF THE PONT NOTRE DAME
A CAVALCADE WAS HEARD IN THAT
DIRECTION
THE YOUNG GIRL HAD RECOGNIZED THE SPITEFUL RECLUSE
PANTING WITH TERROR
SHE TRIED TO DISENGAGE HERSELF
SHE WRITHED SHE MADE MANY STARTS OF
AGONY AND DESPAIR BUT THE OTHER HELD HER WITH INCREDIBLE STRENGTH
THE
LEAN AND BONY FINGERS WHICH BRUISED HER CLENCHED ON HER FLESH AND MET
AROUND IT
ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THIS HAND WAS RIVETED TO HER ARM
IT
WAS MORE THAN A CHAIN MORE THAN A FETTER MORE THAN A RING OF IRON IT
WAS A LIVING PAIR OF PINCERS ENDOWED WITH INTELLIGENCE WHICH EMERGED
FROM THE WALL
SHE FELL BACK AGAINST THE WALL EXHAUSTED AND THEN THE FEAR OF DEATH
TOOK POSSESSION OF HER
SHE THOUGHT OF THE BEAUTY OF LIFE OF YOUTH OF
THE VIEW OF HEAVEN THE ASPECTS OF NATURE OF HER LOVE FOR PHOEBUS OF
ALL THAT WAS VANISHING AND ALL THAT WAS APPROACHING OF THE PRIEST WHO
WAS DENOUNCING HER OF THE HEADSMAN WHO WAS TO COME OF THE GALLOWS
WHICH WAS THERE
THEN SHE FELT TERROR MOUNT TO THE VERY ROOTS OF HER
HAIR AND SHE HEARD THE MOCKING LAUGH OF THE RECLUSE SAYING TO HER IN A
VERY LOW TONE HAH HAH HAH YOU ARE GOING TO BE HANGED
SHE TURNED A DYING LOOK TOWARDS THE WINDOW AND SHE BEHELD THE FIERCE
FACE OF THE SACKED NUN THROUGH THE BARS
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU SHE SAID ALMOST LIFELESS
THE RECLUSE DID NOT REPLY BUT BEGAN TO MUMBLE WITH A SINGSONG
IRRITATED MOCKING INTONATION DAUGHTER OF EGYPT DAUGHTER OF EGYPT
DAUGHTER OF EGYPT
THE UNHAPPY ESMERALDA DROPPED HER HEAD BENEATH HER FLOWING HAIR
COMPREHENDING THAT IT WAS NO HUMAN BEING SHE HAD TO DEAL WITH
ALL AT ONCE THE RECLUSE EXCLAIMED AS THOUGH THE GYPSY'S QUESTION HAD
TAKEN ALL THIS TIME TO REACH HER BRAIN 'WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME
YOU SAY AH WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME GYPSY WELL LISTEN I HAD A
CHILD YOU SEE I HAD A CHILD A CHILD I TELL YOU A PRETTY LITTLE
GIRL MY AGNES SHE WENT ON WILDLY KISSING SOMETHING IN THE
DARK WELL DO YOU SEE DAUGHTER OF EGYPT THEY TOOK MY CHILD FROM ME

FIFTEEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS HAVE I SUFFERED FIFTEEN YEARS HAVE I

HEAD IS TOO LARGE POOR LITTLE ONE WHILE SHE WAS ASLEEP AND IF
THEY WOKE HER UP WHEN THEY TOOK HER IN VAIN SHE MIGHT CRY I WAS NOT
THERE AH GYPSY MOTHERS YOU DEVOURED MY CHILD COME SEE YOUR OWN
THEN SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH OR TO GNASH HER TEETH FOR THE TWO THINGS
RESEMBLED EACH OTHER IN THAT FURIOUS FACE
THE DAY WAS BEGINNING TO
DAWN
AN ASHY GLEAM DIMLY LIGHTED THIS SCENE AND THE GALLOWS GREW MORE
AND MORE DISTINCT IN THE SQUARE
ON THE OTHER SIDE IN THE DIRECTION OF
THE BRIDGE OF NOTRE DAME THE POOR CONDEMNED GIRL FANCIED THAT SHE HEARD
THE SOUND OF CAVALRY APPROACHING
MADAM SHE CRIED CLASPING HER HANDS AND FALLING ON HER KNEES
DISHEVELLED DISTRACTED MAD WITH FRIGHT MADAM HAVE PITY THEY ARE

DO YOU KNOW WHERE ITS MATE IS IF
YOU KNOW TELL ME AND IF IT IS ONLY AT THE OTHER END OF THE WORLD I
WILL CRAWL TO IT ON MY KNEES
AS SHE SPOKE THUS WITH HER OTHER ARM EXTENDED THROUGH THE WINDOW
SHE SHOWED THE GYPSY THE LITTLE EMBROIDERED SHOE
IT WAS ALREADY LIGHT
ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH ITS SHAPE AND ITS COLORS
LET ME SEE THAT SHOE SAID THE GYPSY QUIVERING
GOD GOD
AND AT THE SAME TIME WITH HER HAND WHICH WAS AT LIBERTY SHE QUICKLY
OPENED THE LITTLE BAG ORNAMENTED WITH GREEN GLASS WHICH SHE WORE ABOUT
HER NECK
GO ON GO ON GRUMBLED GUDULE SEARCH YOUR DEMON'S AMULET
ALL AT ONCE SHE STOPPED SHORT TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB AND CRIED IN A
VOICE WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THE VERY DEPTHS OF HER BEING MY DAUGHTER
THE GYPSY HAD JUST DRAWN FROM THE BAG A LITTLE SHOE ABSOLUTELY SIMILAR
TO THE OTHER
TO THIS LITTLE SHOE WAS ATTACHED A PARCHMENT ON WHICH WAS
INSCRIBED THIS CHARM
QUAND LE PARELL RETROUVERAS
TA MERE TE TENDRAS LES BRAS
WHEN THOU SHALT FIND ITS MATE THY MOTHER WILL STRETCH OUT
HER ARMS TO THEE
QUICKER THAN A FLASH OF LIGHTNING THE RECLUSE HAD LAID THE TWO SHOES
TOGETHER HAD READ THE PARCHMENT AND HAD PUT CLOSE TO THE BARS OF THE
WINDOW HER FACE BEAMING WITH CELESTIAL JOY AS SHE CRIED
MY DAUGHTER MY DAUGHTER
MY MOTHER SAID THE GYPSY
HERE WE ARE UNEQUAL TO THE TASK OF DEPICTING THE SCENE
THE WALL AND THE
IRON BARS WERE BETWEEN THEM
OH THE WALL CRIED THE RECLUSE
OH TO
SEE HER AND NOT TO EMBRACE HER YOUR HAND YOUR HAND
THE YOUNG GIRL PASSED HER ARM THROUGH THE OPENING THE RECLUSE THREW
HERSELF ON THAT HAND PRESSED HER LIPS TO IT AND THERE REMAINED BURIED
IN THAT KISS GIVING NO OTHER SIGN OF LIFE THAN A SOB WHICH HEAVED HER
BREAST FROM TIME TO TIME
IN THE MEANWHILE SHE WEPT IN TORRENTS IN
SILENCE IN THE DARK LIKE A RAIN AT NIGHT
THE POOR MOTHER POURED OUT
IN FLOODS UPON THAT ADORED HAND THE DARK AND DEEP WELL OF TEARS WHICH
LAY WITHIN HER AND INTO WHICH HER GRIEF HAD FILTERED DROP BY DROP FOR
FIFTEEN YEARS
ALL AT ONCE SHE ROSE FLUNG ASIDE HER LONG GRAY HAIR FROM HER BROW AND
WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD BEGAN TO SHAKE THE BARS OF HER CAGE CELL WITH
BOTH HANDS MORE FURIOUSLY THAN A LIONESS
THE BARS HELD FIRM
THEN SHE
WENT TO SEEK IN THE CORNER OF HER CELL A HUGE PAVING STONE WHICH SERVED
HER AS A PILLOW AND LAUNCHED IT AGAINST THEM WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT
ONE OF THE BARS BROKE EMITTING THOUSANDS OF SPARKS
A SECOND BLOW
COMPLETELY SHATTERED THE OLD IRON CROSS WHICH BARRICADED THE WINDOW
THEN WITH HER TWO HANDS SHE FINISHED BREAKING AND REMOVING THE RUSTED
STUMPS OF THE BARS
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WOMAN'S HANDS POSSESS
SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH
A PASSAGE BROKEN LESS THAN A MINUTE WAS REQUIRED FOR HER TO SEIZE HER
DAUGHTER BY THE MIDDLE OF HER BODY AND DRAW HER INTO HER CELL
COME
LET ME DRAW YOU OUT OF THE ABYSS SHE MURMURED
WHEN HER DAUGHTER WAS INSIDE THE CELL SHE LAID HER GENTLY ON THE
GROUND THEN RAISED HER UP AGAIN AND BEARING HER IN HER ARMS AS THOUGH
SHE WERE STILL ONLY HER LITTLE AGNES SHE WALKED TO AND FRO IN HER
LITTLE ROOM INTOXICATED FRANTIC JOYOUS CRYING OUT SINGING KISSING

TO THE POINT OF MAKING HER BLUSH SMOOTHED HER SILKY HAIR WITH HER HAND
KISSED HER FOOT HER KNEE HER BROW HER EYES WAS IN RAPTURES OVER

THE YOUNG GIRL LET HER HAVE HER WAY REPEATING AT INTERVALS
AND VERY LOW AND WITH INFINITE TENDERNESS MY MOTHER

SPEAK IN HER EMOTION THE GYPSY WOMAN TOLD ME SO

GYPSY OF OUR BAND WHO DIED LAST YEAR AND WHO ALWAYS CARED FOR ME LIKE

GOD I HAVE FOUND MY CHILD AGAIN BUT IS THIS STORY CREDIBLE NOTHING
WILL KILL ONE OR I SHOULD HAVE DIED OF JOY
AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO CLAP HER HANDS AGAIN AND TO LAUGH AND TO CRY OUT
WE ARE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY
AT THAT MOMENT THE CELL RESOUNDED WITH THE CLANG OF ARMS AND A
GALLOPING OF HORSES WHICH SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM THE PONT NOTRE DAME
AMID ADVANCING FARTHER AND FARTHER ALONG THE QUAY
THE GYPSY THREW
HERSELF WITH ANGUISH INTO THE ARMS OF THE SACKED NUN
SAVE ME SAVE ME MOTHER THEY ARE COMING
OH HEAVEN WHAT ARE YOU SAYING I HAD FORGOTTEN THEY ARE IN PURSUIT

DIE SHE REPEATED SLOWLY GAZING AT HER DAUGHTER WITH STARING EYES
YES MOTHER REPLIED THE FRIGHTENED YOUNG GIRL THEY WANT TO KILL ME
THEY ARE COMING TO SEIZE ME
THAT GALLOWS IS FOR ME SAVE ME SAVE ME
THEY ARE COMING SAVE ME
THE RECLUSE REMAINED FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS MOTIONLESS AND PETRIFIED THEN
SHE MOVED HER HEAD IN SIGN OF DOUBT AND SUDDENLY GIVING VENT TO A BURST
OF LAUGHTER BUT WITH THAT TERRIBLE LAUGH WHICH HAD COME BACK TO HER
HO HO NO 'TIS A DREAM OF WHICH YOU ARE TELLING ME
AH YES I LOST
HER THAT LASTED FIFTEEN YEARS AND THEN I FOUND HER AGAIN AND THAT
LASTED A MINUTE AND THEY WOULD TAKE HER FROM ME AGAIN AND NOW WHEN
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL WHEN SHE IS GROWN UP WHEN SHE SPEAKS TO ME WHEN SHE
LOVES ME IT IS NOW THAT THEY WOULD COME TO DEVOUR HER BEFORE MY VERY
EYES AND I HER MOTHER OH NO THESE THINGS ARE NOT POSSIBLE
THE GOOD
GOD DOES NOT PERMIT SUCH THINGS AS THAT
HERE THE CAVALCADE APPEARED TO HALT AND A VOICE WAS HEARD TO SAY IN THE
DISTANCE
THIS WAY MESSIRE TRISTAN THE PRIEST SAYS THAT WE SHALL FIND HER AT
THE RAT HOLE THE NOISE OF THE HORSES BEGAN AGAIN
THE RECLUSE SPRANG TO HER FEET WITH A SHRIEK OF DESPAIR
FLY FLY MY
CHILD ALL COMES BACK TO ME
YOU ARE RIGHT
IT IS YOUR DEATH HORROR
MALEDICTIONS FLY
SHE THRUST HER HEAD THROUGH THE WINDOW AND WITHDREW IT AGAIN HASTILY
REMAIN SHE SAID IN A LOW CURT AND LUGUBRIOUS TONE AS SHE PRESSED
THE HAND OF THE GYPSY WHO WAS MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE
REMAIN DO NOT
BREATHE THERE ARE SOLDIERS EVERYWHERE
YOU CANNOT GET OUT
IT IS TOO
LIGHT
HER EYES WERE DRY AND BURNING
SHE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT BUT SHE
PACED THE CELL HURRIEDLY AND HALTED NOW AND THEN TO PLUCK OUT HANDFULS
OF HER GRAY HAIRS WHICH SHE AFTERWARDS TORE WITH HER TEETH
SUDDENLY SHE SAID THEY DRAW NEAR
I WILL SPEAK WITH THEM
HIDE
YOURSELF IN THIS CORNER
THEY WILL NOT SEE YOU
I WILL TELL THEM THAT
YOU HAVE MADE YOUR ESCAPE
THAT I RELEASED YOU I' FAITH
SHE SET HER DAUGHTER DOWN FOR SHE WAS STILL CARRYING HER IN ONE
CORNER OF THE CELL WHICH WAS NOT VISIBLE FROM WITHOUT
SHE MADE HER
CROUCH DOWN ARRANGED HER CAREFULLY SO THAT NEITHER FOOT NOR HAND
PROJECTED FROM THE SHADOW UNTIED HER BLACK HAIR WHICH SHE SPREAD OVER
HER WHITE ROBE TO CONCEAL IT PLACED IN FRONT OF HER HER JUG AND HER
PAVING STONE THE ONLY ARTICLES OF FURNITURE WHICH SHE POSSESSED
IMAGINING THAT THIS JUG AND STONE WOULD HIDE HER
AND WHEN THIS WAS
FINISHED SHE BECAME MORE TRANQUIL AND KNELT DOWN TO PRAY
THE DAY
WHICH WAS ONLY DAWNING STILL LEFT MANY SHADOWS IN THE RAT HOLE
AT THAT MOMENT THE VOICE OF THE PRIEST THAT INFERNAL VOICE PASSED
VERY CLOSE TO THE CELL CRYING
THIS WAY CAPTAIN PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS
AT THAT NAME AT THAT VOICE LA ESMERALDA CROUCHING IN HER CORNER MADE
A MOVEMENT
DO NOT STIR SAID GUDULE
SHE HAD BARELY FINISHED WHEN A TUMULT OF MEN SWORDS AND HORSES HALTED
AROUND THE CELL
THE MOTHER ROSE QUICKLY AND WENT TO POST HERSELF BEFORE
HER WINDOW IN ORDER TO STOP IT UP
SHE BEHELD A LARGE TROOP OF ARMED
MEN BOTH HORSE AND FOOT DRAWN UP ON THE GRVE
THE COMMANDER DISMOUNTED AND CAME TOWARD HER
OLD WOMAN SAID THIS MAN WHO HAD AN ATROCIOUS FACE WE ARE IN SEARCH
OF A WITCH TO HANG HER WE WERE TOLD THAT YOU HAD HER
THE POOR MOTHER ASSUMED AS INDIFFERENT AN AIR AS SHE COULD AND
REPLIED
I KNOW NOT WHAT YOU MEAN
THE OTHER RESUMED TTE DIEU WHAT WAS IT THAT FRIGHTENED ARCHDEACON
SAID WHERE IS HE
MONSEIGNEUR SAID A SOLDIER HE HAS DISAPPEARED
COME NOW OLD MADWOMAN BEGAN THE COMMANDER AGAIN DO NOT LIE
A
SORCERESS WAS GIVEN IN CHARGE TO YOU
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER
THE RECLUSE DID NOT WISH TO DENY ALL FOR FEAR OF AWAKENING SUSPICION
AND REPLIED IN A SINCERE AND SURLY TONE
IF YOU ARE SPEAKING OF A BIG YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS PUT INTO MY HANDS A
WHILE AGO I WILL TELL YOU THAT SHE BIT ME AND THAT I RELEASED HER
THERE LEAVE ME IN PEACE
THE COMMANDER MADE A GRIMACE OF DISAPPOINTMENT
DON'T LIE TO ME OLD
SPECTRE SAID HE
MY NAME IS TRISTAN L'HERMITE AND I AM THE KING'S
GOSSIP
TRISTAN THE HERMIT DO YOU HEAR HE ADDED AS HE GLANCED AT THE
PLACE DE GRVE AROUND HIM 'TIS A NAME WHICH HAS AN ECHO HERE
YOU MIGHT BE SATAN THE HERMIT REPLIED GUDULE WHO WAS REGAINING HOPE
BUT I SHOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY TO YOU AND I SHOULD NEVER BE
AFRAID OF YOU
TTE DIEU SAID TRISTAN HERE IS A CRONE AH SO THE WITCH GIRL
HATH FLED AND IN WHICH DIRECTION DID SHE GO GUDULE REPLIED IN A
CARELESS TONE
THROUGH THE RUE DU MOUTON I BELIEVE
TRISTAN TURNED HIS HEAD AND MADE A SIGN TO HIS TROOP TO PREPARE TO SET
OUT ON THE MARCH AGAIN
THE RECLUSE BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
MONSEIGNEUR SUDDENLY SAID AN ARCHER ASK THE OLD ELF WHY THE BARS OF
HER WINDOW ARE BROKEN IN THIS MANNER
THIS QUESTION BROUGHT ANGUISH AGAIN TO THE HEART OF THE MISERABLE
MOTHER
NEVERTHELESS SHE DID NOT LOSE ALL PRESENCE OF MIND
THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THUS SHE STAMMERED
BAH RETORTED THE ARCHER ONLY YESTERDAY THEY STILL FORMED A FINE
BLACK CROSS WHICH INSPIRED DEVOTION
TRISTAN EAST A SIDELONG GLANCE AT THE RECLUSE
I THINK THE OLD DAME IS GETTING CONFUSED
THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN FELT THAT ALL DEPENDED ON HER SELF POSSESSION
AND ALTHOUGH WITH DEATH IN HER SOUL SHE BEGAN TO GRIN
MOTHERS POSSESS
SUCH STRENGTH
BAH SAID SHE THE MAN IS DRUNK
'TIS MORE THAN A YEAR SINCE THE TAIL
OF A STONE CART DASHED AGAINST MY WINDOW AND BROKE IN THE GRATING
AND
HOW I CURSED THE CARTER TOO
'TIS TRUE SAID ANOTHER ARCHER I WAS THERE
ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE PEOPLE ARE TO BE FOUND WHO HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING
THIS UNEXPECTED TESTIMONY FROM THE ARCHER RE ENCOURAGED THE RECLUSE
WHOM THIS INTERROGATORY WAS FORCING TO CROSS AN ABYSS ON THE EDGE OF
A KNIFE
BUT SHE WAS CONDEMNED TO A PERPETUAL ALTERNATIVE OF HOPE AND
ALARM
IF IT WAS A CART WHICH DID IT RETORTED THE FIRST SOLDIER THE STUMPS
OF THE BARS SHOULD BE THRUST INWARDS WHILE THEY ACTUALLY ARE PUSHED
OUTWARDS
HO HO SAID TRISTAN TO THE SOLDIER YOU HAVE THE NOSE OF AN
INQUISITOR OF THE CHTELET
REPLY TO WHAT HE SAYS OLD WOMAN
GOOD HEAVENS SHE EXCLAIMED DRIVEN TO BAY AND IN A VOICE THAT WAS
FULL OF TEARS IN DESPITE OF HER EFFORTS I SWEAR TO YOU MONSEIGNEUR
THAT 'TWAS A CART WHICH BROKE THOSE BARS
YOU HEAR THE MAN WHO SAW IT
AND THEN WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH YOUR GYPSY
HUM GROWLED TRISTAN
THE DEVIL WENT ON THE SOLDIER FLATTERED BY THE PROVOST'S PRAISE
THESE FRACTURES OF THE IRON ARE PERFECTLY FRESH
TRISTAN TOSSED HIS HEAD
SHE TURNED PALE
HOW LONG AGO SAY YOU DID THE CART DO IT
A MONTH A FORTNIGHT PERHAPS MONSEIGHEUR I KNOW NOT
SHE FIRST SAID MORE THAN A YEAR OBSERVED THE SOLDIER
THAT IS SUSPICIOUS SAID THE PROVOST
MONSEIGNEUR SHE CRIED STILL PRESSED AGAINST THE OPENING AND
TREMBLING LEST SUSPICION SHOULD LEAD THEM TO THRUST THEIR HEADS THROUGH
AND LOOK INTO HER CELL MONSEIGNEUR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT 'TWAS A CART
WHICH BROKE THIS GRATING
I SWEAR IT TO YOU BY THE ANGELS OF PARADISE
IF IT WAS NOT A CART MAY I BE ETERNALLY DAMNED AND I REJECT GOD
YOU PUT A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT INTO THAT OATH SAID TRISTAN WITH HIS
INQUISITORIAL GLANCE
THE POOR WOMAN FELT HER ASSURANCE VANISHING MORE AND MORE
SHE HAD
REACHED THE POINT OF BLUNDERING AND SHE COMPREHENDED WITH TERROR THAT
SHE WAS SAYING WHAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE SAID
HERE ANOTHER SOLDIER CAME UP CRYING
MONSIEUR THE OLD HAG LIES
THE SORCERESS DID NOT FLEE THROUGH THE RUE
DE MOUTON
THE STREET CHAIN HAS REMAINED STRETCHED ALL NIGHT AND THE
CHAIN GUARD HAS SEEN NO ONE PASS
TRISTAN WHOSE FACE BECAME MORE SINISTER WITH EVERY MOMENT ADDRESSED
THE RECLUSE
WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY TO THAT
SHE TRIED TO MAKE HEAD AGAINST THIS NEW INCIDENT
THAT I DO NOT KNOW MONSEIGNEUR THAT I MAY HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
I
BELIEVE IN FACT THAT SHE CROSSED THE WATER
THAT IS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SAID THE PROVOST AND IT IS NOT
VERY LIKELY THAT SHE WOULD WISH TO RE ENTER THE CITY WHERE SHE WAS
BEING PURSUED
YOU ARE LYING OLD WOMAN
AND THEN ADDED THE FIRST SOLDIER THERE IS NO BOAT EITHER ON THIS
SIDE OF THE STREAM OR ON THE OTHER
SHE SWAM ACROSS REPLIED THE RECLUSE DEFENDING HER GROUND FOOT BY
FOOT
DO WOMEN SWIM SAID THE SOLDIER
TTE DIEU OLD WOMAN YOU ARE LYING REPEATED TRISTAN ANGRILY
I
HAVE A GOOD MIND TO ABANDON THAT SORCERESS AND TAKE YOU
A QUARTER OF AN
HOUR OF TORTURE WILL PERCHANCE DRAW THE TRUTH FROM YOUR THROAT
COME
YOU ARE TO FOLLOW US
SHE SEIZED ON THESE WORDS WITH AVIDITY
AS YOU PLEASE MONSEIGNEUR
DO IT
DO IT
TORTURE
I AM WILLING
TAKE
ME AWAY
QUICK QUICK LET US SET OUT AT ONCE DURING THAT TIME SHE
SAID TO HERSELF MY DAUGHTER WILL MAKE HER ESCAPE
'S DEATH SAID THE PROVOST WHAT AN APPETITE FOR THE RACK I
UNDERSTAND NOT THIS MADWOMAN AT ALL
AN OLD GRAY HAIRED SERGEANT OF THE GUARD STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS AND
ADDRESSING THE PROVOST
MAD IN SOOTH MONSEIGNEUR
IF SHE RELEASED THE GYPSY IT WAS NOT HER
FAULT FOR SHE LOVES NOT THE GYPSIES
I HAVE BEEN OF THE WATCH THESE
FIFTEEN YEARS AND I HEAR HER EVERY EVENING CURSING THE BOHEMIAN WOMEN
WITH ENDLESS IMPRECATIONS
IF THE ONE OF WHOM WE ARE IN PURSUIT IS AS I
SUPPOSE THE LITTLE DANCER WITH THE GOAT SHE DETESTS THAT ONE ABOVE ALL
THE REST
GUDULE MADE AN EFFORT AND SAID
THAT ONE ABOVE ALL
THE UNANIMOUS TESTIMONY OF THE MEN OF THE WATCH CONFIRMED THE OLD
SERGEANT'S WORDS TO THE PROVOST
TRISTAN L'HERMITE IN DESPAIR AT
EXTRACTING ANYTHING FROM THE RECLUSE TURNED HIS BACK ON HER AND WITH
UNSPEAKABLE ANXIETY SHE BEHELD HIM DIRECT HIS COURSE SLOWLY TOWARDS HIS
HORSE
COME HE SAID BETWEEN HIS TEETH MARCH ON LET US SET OUT AGAIN ON
THE QUEST
I SHALL NOT SLEEP UNTIL THAT GYPSY IS HANGED
BUT HE STILL HESITATED FOR SOME TIME BEFORE MOUNTING HIS HORSE
GUDULE
PALPITATED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AS SHE BEHELD HIM CAST ABOUT THE
PLACE THAT UNEASY LOOK OF A HUNTING DOG WHICH INSTINCTIVELY FEELS THAT
THE LAIR OF THE BEAST IS CLOSE TO HIM AND IS LOATH TO GO AWAY
AT
LENGTH HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND LEAPED INTO HIS SADDLE
GUDULE'S HORRIBLY
COMPRESSED HEART NOW DILATED AND SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AS SHE CAST A
GLANCE AT HER DAUGHTER WHOM SHE HAD NOT VENTURED TO LOOK AT WHILE THEY
WERE THERE SAVED
THE POOR CHILD HAD REMAINED ALL THIS TIME IN HER CORNER WITHOUT
BREATHING WITHOUT MOVING WITH THE IDEA OF DEATH BEFORE HER
SHE HAD
LOST NOTHING OF THE SCENE BETWEEN GUDULE AND TRISTAN AND THE ANGUISH
OF HER MOTHER HAD FOUND ITS ECHO IN HER HEART
SHE HAD HEARD ALL THE
SUCCESSIVE SNAPPINGS OF THE THREAD BY WHICH SHE HUNG SUSPENDED OVER THE
GULF TWENTY TIMES SHE HAD FANCIED THAT SHE SAW IT BREAK AND AT LAST
SHE BEGAN TO BREATHE AGAIN AND TO FEEL HER FOOT ON FIRM GROUND
AT THAT
MOMENT SHE HEARD A VOICE SAYING TO THE PROVOST CORBOEUF MONSIEUR
LE PREVT 'TIS NO AFFAIR OF MINE A MAN OF ARMS TO HANG WITCHES
THE RABBLE OF THE POPULACE IS SUPPRESSED
I LEAVE YOU TO ATTEND TO THE
MATTER ALONE
YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO REJOIN MY COMPANY WHO ARE WAITING
FOR THEIR CAPTAIN
THE VOICE WAS THAT OF PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS THAT WHICH TOOK PLACE
WITHIN HER WAS INEFFABLE
HE WAS THERE HER FRIEND HER PROTECTOR HER
SUPPORT HER REFUGE HER PHOEBUS
SHE ROSE AND BEFORE HER MOTHER COULD
PREVENT HER SHE HAD RUSHED TO THE WINDOW CRYING
PHOEBUS AID ME MY PHOEBUS
PHOEBUS WAS NO LONGER THERE
HE HAD JUST TURNED THE CORNER OF THE RUE DE
LA COUTELLERIE AT A GALLOP
BUT TRISTAN HAD NOT YET TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE
THE RECLUSE RUSHED UPON HER DAUGHTER WITH A ROAR OF AGONY
SHE DRAGGED
HER VIOLENTLY BACK DIGGING HER NAILS INTO HER NECK
A TIGRESS MOTHER
DOES NOT STAND ON TRIFLES
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
TRISTAN HAD SEEN
H H HE EXCLAIMED WITH A LAUGH WHICH LAID BARE ALL HIS TEETH AND
MADE HIS FACE RESEMBLE THE MUZZLE OF A WOLF TWO MICE IN THE TRAP
I SUSPECTED AS MUCH SAID THE SOLDIER
TRISTAN CLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER
YOU ARE A GOOD CAT COME HE ADDED WHERE IS HENRIET COUSIN
A MAN WHO HAD NEITHER THE GARMENTS NOR THE AIR OF A SOLDIER STEPPED
FROM THE RANKS
HE WORE A COSTUME HALF GRAY HALF BROWN FLAT HAIR
LEATHER SLEEVES AND CARRIED A BUNDLE OF ROPES IN HIS HUGE HAND
THIS
MAN ALWAYS ATTENDED TRISTAN WHO ALWAYS ATTENDED LOUIS XI
FRIEND
SAID TRISTAN L'HERMITE I PRESUME THAT THIS IS THE SORCERESS OF WHOM WE
ARE IN SEARCH
YOU WILL HANG ME THIS ONE
HAVE YOU YOUR LADDER
THERE IS ONE YONDER UNDER THE SHED OF THE PILLAR HOUSE REPLIED THE
MAN
IS IT ON THIS JUSTICE THAT THE THING IS TO BE DONE HE ADDED
POINTING TO THE STONE GIBBET
YES
HO H CONTINUED THE MAN WITH A HUGE LAUGH WHICH WAS STILL MORE
BRUTAL THAN THAT OF THE PROVOST WE SHALL NOT HAVE FAR TO GO
MAKE HASTE SAID TRISTAN YOU SHALL LAUGH AFTERWARDS
IN THE MEANTIME THE RECLUSE HAD NOT UTTERED ANOTHER WORD SINCE TRISTAN
HAD SEEN HER DAUGHTER AND ALL HOPE WAS LOST
SHE HAD FLUNG THE POOR
GYPSY HALF DEAD INTO THE CORNER OF THE CELLAR AND HAD PLACED HERSELF
ONCE MORE AT THE WINDOW WITH BOTH HANDS RESTING ON THE ANGLE OF THE SILL
LIKE TWO CLAWS
IN THIS ATTITUDE SHE WAS SEEN TO CAST UPON ALL THOSE
SOLDIERS HER GLANCE WHICH HAD BECOME WILD AND FRANTIC ONCE MORE
AT THE
MOMENT WHEN RENNET COUSIN APPROACHED HER CELL SHE SHOWED HIM SO SAVAGE
A FACE THAT HE SHRANK BACK
MONSEIGNEUR HE SAID RETURNING TO THE PROVOST WHICH AM I TO TAKE
THE YOUNG ONE
SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR THE OLD ONE SEEMETH DIFFICULT
POOR LITTLE DANCER WITH THE GOAT SAID THE OLD SERGEANT OF THE WATCH
RENNET COUSIN APPROACHED THE WINDOW AGAIN
THE MOTHER'S EYES MADE HIS
OWN DROOP
HE SAID WITH A GOOD DEAL OF TIMIDITY
MADAM
SHE INTERRUPTED HIM IN A VERY LOW BUT FURIOUS VOICE
WHAT DO YOU ASK
IT IS NOT YOU HE SAID IT IS THE OTHER
WHAT OTHER
THE YOUNG ONE
SHE BEGAN TO SHAKE HER HEAD CRYING

SHE SAID WITH A STRANGE SNEER

THERE IS NO ONE HERE
I TELL YOU THAT THERE IS REPLIED THE EXECUTIONER
WE HAVE ALL SEEN
THAT THERE ARE TWO OF YOU

THRUST YOUR HEAD THROUGH
THE WINDOW
THE EXECUTIONER OBSERVED THE MOTHER'S FINGER NAILS AND DARED NOT
MAKE HASTE SHOUTED TRISTAN WHO HAD JUST RANGED HIS TROOPS IN A
CIRCLE ROUND THE RAT HOLE AND WHO SAT ON HIS HORSE BESIDE THE GALLOWS
RENNET RETURNED ONCE MORE TO THE PROVOST IN GREAT EMBARRASSMENT
HE HAD
FLUNG HIS ROPE ON THE GROUND AND WAS TWISTING HIS HAT BETWEEN HIS HANDS
WITH AN AWKWARD AIR
MONSEIGNEUR HE ASKED WHERE AM I TO ENTER
BY THE DOOR
THERE IS NONE
BY THE WINDOW
'TIS TOO SMALL
MAKE IT LARGER SAID TRISTAN ANGRILY
HAVE YOU NOT PICKAXES
THE MOTHER STILL LOOKED ON STEADFASTLY FROM THE DEPTHS OF HER CAVERN
SHE NO LONGER HOPED FOR ANYTHING SHE NO LONGER KNEW WHAT SHE WISHED
EXCEPT THAT SHE DID NOT WISH THEM TO TAKE HER DAUGHTER
RENNET COUSIN WENT IN SEARCH OF THE CHEST OF TOOLS FOR THE NIGHT MAN
UNDER THE SHED OF THE PILLAR HOUSE
HE DREW FROM IT ALSO THE DOUBLE
LADDER WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY SET UP AGAINST THE GALLOWS
FIVE OR SIX OF
THE PROVOST'S MEN ARMED THEMSELVES WITH PICKS AND CROWBARS AND TRISTAN
BETOOK HIMSELF IN COMPANY WITH THEM TOWARDS THE WINDOW
OLD WOMAN SAID THE PROVOST IN A SEVERE TONE DELIVER UP TO US THAT
GIRL QUIETLY
SHE LOOKED AT HIM LIKE ONE WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
TTE DIEU CONTINUED TRISTAN WHY DO YOU TRY TO PREVENT THIS
SORCERESS BEING HUNG AS IT PLEASES THE KING
THE WRETCHED WOMAN BEGAN TO LAUGH IN HER WILD WAY
WHY SHE IS MY DAUGHTER
THE TONE IN WHICH SHE PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS MADE EVEN HENRIET COUSIN
SHUDDER
I AM SORRY FOR THAT SAID THE PROVOST BUT IT IS THE KING'S GOOD
PLEASURE
SHE CRIED REDOUBLING HER TERRIBLE LAUGH
WHAT IS YOUR KING TO ME I TELL YOU THAT SHE IS MY DAUGHTER
PIERCE THE WALL SAID TRISTAN
IN ORDER TO MAKE A SUFFICIENTLY WIDE OPENING IT SUFFICED TO DISLODGE
ONE COURSE OF STONE BELOW THE WINDOW
WHEN THE MOTHER HEARD THE PICKS
AND CROWBARS MINING HER FORTRESS SHE UTTERED A TERRIBLE CRY THEN SHE
BEGAN TO STRIDE ABOUT HER CELL WITH FRIGHTFUL SWIFTNESS A WILD BEASTS'
HABIT WHICH HER CAGE HAD IMPARTED TO HER
SHE NO LONGER SAID ANYTHING
BUT HER EYES FLAMED
THE SOLDIERS WERE CHILLED TO THE VERY SOUL
ALL AT ONCE SHE SEIZED HER PAVING STONE LAUGHED AND HURLED IT WITH
BOTH FISTS UPON THE WORKMEN
THE STONE BADLY FLUNG FOR HER HANDS
TREMBLED TOUCHED NO ONE AND FELL SHORT UNDER THE FEET OF TRISTAN'S
HORSE
SHE GNASHED HER TEETH
IN THE MEANTIME ALTHOUGH THE SUN HAD NOT YET RISEN IT WAS BROAD
DAYLIGHT A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR ENLIVENED THE ANCIENT DECAYED CHIMNEYS
OF THE PILLAR HOUSE
IT WAS THE HOUR WHEN THE EARLIEST WINDOWS OF THE
GREAT CITY OPEN JOYOUSLY ON THE ROOFS
SOME WORKMEN A FEW FRUIT SELLERS
ON THEIR WAY TO THE MARKETS ON THEIR ASSES BEGAN TO TRAVERSE THE GRVE
THEY HALTED FOR A MOMENT BEFORE THIS GROUP OF SOLDIERS CLUSTERED ROUND
THE RAT HOLE STARED AT IT WITH AN AIR OF ASTONISHMENT AND PASSED ON
THE RECLUSE HAD GONE AND SEATED HERSELF BY HER DAUGHTER COVERING HER
WITH HER BODY IN FRONT OF HER WITH STARING EYES LISTENING TO THE POOR
CHILD WHO DID NOT STIR BUT WHO KEPT MURMURING IN A LOW VOICE THESE
WORDS ONLY PHOEBUS PHOEBUS IN PROPORTION AS THE WORK OF THE
DEMOLISHERS SEEMED TO ADVANCE THE MOTHER MECHANICALLY RETREATED AND
PRESSED THE YOUNG GIRL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE WALL
ALL AT ONCE THE
RECLUSE BEHELD THE STONE FOR SHE WAS STANDING GUARD AND NEVER TOOK
HER EYES FROM IT MOVE AND SHE HEARD TRISTAN'S VOICE ENCOURAGING THE
WORKERS
THEN SHE AROUSED FROM THE DEPRESSION INTO WHICH SHE HAD FALLEN
DURING THE LAST FEW MOMENTS CRIED OUT AND AS SHE SPOKE HER VOICE
NOW RENT THE EAR LIKE A SAW THEN STAMMERED AS THOUGH ALL KIND OF
MALEDICTIONS WERE PRESSING TO HER LIPS TO BURST FORTH AT ONCE
HO HO HO WHY THIS IS TERRIBLE YOU ARE RUFFIANS ARE YOU REALLY

MOTHER'S LAST BULWARK
SHE THREW HERSELF UPON IT SHE TRIED TO HOLD IT BACK SHE SCRATCHED THE
STONE WITH HER NAILS BUT THE MASSIVE BLOCK SET IN MOVEMENT BY SIX MEN
ESCAPED HER AND GLIDED GENTLY TO THE GROUND ALONG THE IRON LEVERS
THE MOTHER PERCEIVING AN ENTRANCE EFFECTED FELL DOWN IN FRONT OF THE
OPENING BARRICADING THE BREACH WITH HER BODY BEATING THE PAVEMENT WITH
HER HEAD AND SHRIEKING WITH A VOICE RENDERED SO HOARSE BY FATIGUE THAT
IT WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE
HELP FIRE FIRE
NOW TAKE THE WENCH SAID TRISTAN STILL IMPASSIVE

PLACED BETWEEN THE PROVOST AND THE MOTHER BOTH THREATENING THE
SOLDIERS HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THEN TOOK THEIR RESOLUTION AND
ADVANCED TOWARDS THE RAT HOLE
WHEN THE RECLUSE SAW THIS SHE ROSE ABRUPTLY ON HER KNEES FLUNG ASIDE
HER HAIR FROM HER FACE THEN LET HER THIN FLAYED HANDS FALL BY HER SIDE
THEN GREAT TEARS FELL ONE BY ONE FROM HER EYES THEY FLOWED DOWN
HER CHEEKS THROUGH A FURROW LIKE A TORRENT THROUGH A BED WHICH IT HAS
HOLLOWED FOR ITSELF

WE WILL NOT TRY TO GIVE AN IDEA OF HER GESTURES HER TONE OF THE TEARS
WHICH SHE SWALLOWED AS SHE SPOKE OF THE HANDS WHICH SHE CLASPED AND
THEN WRUNG OF THE HEART BREAKING SMILES OF THE SWIMMING GLANCES
OF THE GROANS THE SIGHS THE MISERABLE AND AFFECTING CRIES WHICH SHE
MINGLED WITH HER DISORDERED WILD AND INCOHERENT WORDS
WHEN SHE BECAME
SILENT TRISTAN L'HERMITE FROWNED BUT IT WAS TO CONCEAL A TEAR WHICH
WELLED UP IN HIS TIGER'S EYE
HE CONQUERED THIS WEAKNESS HOWEVER AND
SAID IN A CURT TONE
THE KING WILLS IT
THEN HE BENT DOWN TO THE EAR OF RENNET COUSIN AND SAID TO HIM IN A VERY
LOW TONE
MAKE AN END OF IT QUICKLY POSSIBLY THE REDOUBTABLE PROVOST FELT HIS
HEART ALSO FAILING HIM
THE EXECUTIONER AND THE SERGEANTS ENTERED THE CELL
THE MOTHER OFFERED
NO RESISTANCE ONLY SHE DRAGGED HERSELF TOWARDS HER DAUGHTER AND THREW
HERSELF BODILY UPON HER
THE GYPSY BEHELD THE SOLDIERS APPROACH
THE
HORROR OF DEATH REANIMATED HER
MOTHER SHE SHRIEKED IN A TONE OF INDESCRIBABLE DISTRESS MOTHER
THEY ARE COMING DEFEND ME
YES MY LOVE I AM DEFENDING YOU REPLIED THE MOTHER IN A DYING
VOICE AND CLASPING HER CLOSELY IN HER ARMS SHE COVERED HER WITH
KISSES
THE TWO LYING THUS ON THE EARTH THE MOTHER UPON THE DAUGHTER
PRESENTED A SPECTACLE WORTHY OF PITY
RENNET COUSIN GRASPED THE YOUNG GIRL BY THE MIDDLE OF HER BODY BENEATH
HER BEAUTIFUL SHOULDERS
WHEN SHE FELT THAT HAND SHE CRIED HEUH AND
FAINTED
THE EXECUTIONER WHO WAS SHEDDING LARGE TEARS UPON HER DROP
BY DROP WAS ABOUT TO BEAR HER AWAY IN HIS ARMS
HE TRIED TO DETACH THE
MOTHER WHO HAD SO TO SPEAK KNOTTED HER HANDS AROUND HER DAUGHTER'S
WAIST BUT SHE CLUNG SO STRONGLY TO HER CHILD THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO SEPARATE THEM
THEN RENNET COUSIN DRAGGED THE YOUNG GIRL OUTSIDE THE
CELL AND THE MOTHER AFTER HER
THE MOTHER'S EYES WERE ALSO CLOSED
AT THAT MOMENT THE SUN ROSE AND THERE WAS ALREADY ON THE PLACE A
FAIRLY NUMEROUS ASSEMBLY OF PEOPLE WHO LOOKED ON FROM A DISTANCE AT WHAT
WAS BEING THUS DRAGGED ALONG THE PAVEMENT TO THE GIBBET
FOR THAT WAS
PROVOST TRISTAN'S WAY AT EXECUTIONS
HE HAD A PASSION FOR PREVENTING THE
APPROACH OF THE CURIOUS
THERE WAS NO ONE AT THE WINDOWS
ONLY AT A DISTANCE AT THE SUMMIT OF
THAT ONE OF THE TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME WHICH COMMANDS THE GRVE TWO MEN
OUTLINED IN BLACK AGAINST THE LIGHT MORNING SKY AND WHO SEEMED TO BE
LOOKING ON WERE VISIBLE
RENNET COUSIN PAUSED AT THE FOOT OF THE FATAL LADDER WITH THAT WHICH
HE WAS DRAGGING AND BARELY BREATHING WITH SO MUCH PITY DID THE THING
INSPIRE HIM HE PASSED THE ROPE AROUND THE LOVELY NECK OF THE YOUNG
GIRL
THE UNFORTUNATE CHILD FELT THE HORRIBLE TOUCH OF THE HEMP
SHE
RAISED HER EYELIDS AND SAW THE FLESHLESS ARM OF THE STONE GALLOWS
EXTENDED ABOVE HER HEAD
THEN SHE SHOOK HERSELF AND SHRIEKED IN A LOUD
AND HEARTRENDING VOICE NO NO I WILL NOT HER MOTHER WHOSE HEAD WAS
BURIED AND CONCEALED IN HER DAUGHTER'S GARMENTS SAID NOT A WORD ONLY
HER WHOLE BODY COULD BE SEEN TO QUIVER AND SHE WAS HEARD TO REDOUBLE
HER KISSES ON HER CHILD
THE EXECUTIONER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS MOMENT
TO HASTILY LOOSE THE ARMS WITH WHICH SHE CLASPED THE CONDEMNED GIRL
EITHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OR DESPAIR SHE LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY
THEN HE
TOOK THE YOUNG GIRL ON HIS SHOULDER FROM WHICH THE CHARMING CREATURE
HUNG GRACEFULLY BENT OVER HIS LARGE HEAD
THEN HE SET HIS FOOT ON THE
LADDER IN ORDER TO ASCEND
AT THAT MOMENT THE MOTHER WHO WAS CROUCHING ON THE PAVEMENT OPENED
HER EYES WIDE
WITHOUT UTTERING A CRY SHE RAISED HERSELF ERECT WITH
A TERRIBLE EXPRESSION THEN SHE FLUNG HERSELF UPON THE HAND OF THE
EXECUTIONER LIKE A BEAST ON ITS PREY AND BIT IT
IT WAS DONE LIKE A
FLASH OF LIGHTNING
THE HEADSMAN HOWLED WITH PAIN
THOSE NEAR BY RUSHED
UP
WITH DIFFICULTY THEY WITHDREW HIS BLEEDING HAND FROM THE MOTHER'S
TEETH
SHE PRESERVED A PROFOUND SILENCE
THEY THRUST HER BACK WITH MUCH
BRUTALITY AND NOTICED THAT HER HEAD FELL HEAVILY ON THE PAVEMENT
THEY
RAISED HER SHE FELL BACK AGAIN
SHE WAS DEAD
THE EXECUTIONER WHO HAD NOT LOOSED HIS HOLD ON THE YOUNG GIRL BEGAN TO
ASCEND THE LADDER ONCE MORE
CHAPTER II
THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE CLAD IN WHITE
DANTE
WHEN QUASIMODO SAW THAT THE CELL WAS EMPTY THAT THE GYPSY WAS NO LONGER
THERE THAT WHILE HE HAD BEEN DEFENDING HER SHE HAD BEEN ABDUCTED HE
GRASPED HIS HAIR WITH BOTH HANDS AND STAMPED WITH SURPRISE AND PAIN
THEN HE SET OUT TO RUN THROUGH THE ENTIRE CHURCH SEEKING HIS BOHEMIAN
HOWLING STRANGE CRIES TO ALL THE CORNERS OF THE WALLS STREWING HIS RED
HAIR ON THE PAVEMENT
IT WAS JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE KING'S ARCHERS
WERE MAKING THEIR VICTORIOUS ENTRANCE INTO NOTRE DAME ALSO IN SEARCH
OF THE GYPSY
QUASIMODO POOR DEAF FELLOW AIDED THEM IN THEIR FATAL
INTENTIONS WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT HE THOUGHT THAT THE OUTCASTS WERE THE
GYPSY'S ENEMIES
HE HIMSELF CONDUCTED TRISTAN L'HERMITE TO ALL POSSIBLE
HIDING PLACES OPENED TO HIM THE SECRET DOORS THE DOUBLE BOTTOMS OF
THE ALTARS THE REAR SACRISTRIES
IF THE UNFORTUNATE GIRL HAD STILL BEEN
THERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HE HIMSELF WHO WOULD HAVE DELIVERED HER UP
WHEN THE FATIGUE OF FINDING NOTHING HAD DISHEARTENED TRISTAN WHO WAS
NOT EASILY DISCOURAGED QUASIMODO CONTINUED THE SEARCH ALONE
HE MADE
THE TOUR OF THE CHURCH TWENTY TIMES LENGTH AND BREADTH UP AND
DOWN ASCENDING AND DESCENDING RUNNING CALLING SHOUTING PEEPING
RUMMAGING RANSACKING THRUSTING HIS HEAD INTO EVERY HOLE PUSHING A
TORCH UNDER EVERY VAULT DESPAIRING MAD
A MALE WHO HAS LOST HIS FEMALE
IS NO MORE ROARING NOR MORE HAGGARD
AT LAST WHEN HE WAS SURE PERFECTLY SURE THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER THERE
THAT ALL WAS AT AN END THAT SHE HAD BEEN SNATCHED FROM HIM HE SLOWLY
MOUNTED THE STAIRCASE TO THE TOWERS THAT STAIRCASE WHICH HE HAD
ASCENDED WITH SO MUCH EAGERNESS AND TRIUMPH ON THE DAY WHEN HE HAD
SAVED HER
HE PASSED THOSE SAME PLACES ONCE MORE WITH DROOPING HEAD
VOICELESS TEARLESS ALMOST BREATHLESS
THE CHURCH WAS AGAIN DESERTED
AND HAD FALLEN BACK INTO ITS SILENCE
THE ARCHERS HAD QUITTED IT TO
TRACK THE SORCERESS IN THE CITY
QUASIMODO LEFT ALONE IN THAT VAST
NOTRE DAME SO BESIEGED AND TUMULTUOUS BUT A SHORT TIME BEFORE ONCE
MORE BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE CELL WHERE THE GYPSY HAD SLEPT FOR SO MANY
WEEKS UNDER HIS GUARDIANSHIP
AS HE APPROACHED IT HE FANCIED THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS FIND HER THERE
WHEN AT THE TURN OF THE GALLERY WHICH OPENS ON THE ROOF OF THE SIDE
AISLES HE PERCEIVED THE TINY CELL WITH ITS LITTLE WINDOW AND ITS LITTLE
DOOR CROUCHING BENEATH A GREAT FLYING BUTTRESS LIKE A BIRD'S NEST UNDER
A BRANCH THE POOR MAN'S HEART FAILED HIM AND HE LEANED AGAINST A
PILLAR TO KEEP FROM FALLING
HE IMAGINED THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE RETURNED
THITHER THAT SOME GOOD GENIUS HAD NO DOUBT BROUGHT HER BACK THAT
THIS CHAMBER WAS TOO TRANQUIL TOO SAFE TOO CHARMING FOR HER NOT TO
BE THERE AND HE DARED NOT TAKE ANOTHER STEP FOR FEAR OF DESTROYING
HIS ILLUSION
YES HE SAID TO HIMSELF PERCHANCE SHE IS SLEEPING OR
PRAYING
I MUST NOT DISTURB HER
AT LENGTH HE SUMMONED UP COURAGE ADVANCED ON TIPTOE LOOKED ENTERED
EMPTY
THE CELL WAS STILL EMPTY
THE UNHAPPY DEAF MAN WALKED SLOWLY
ROUND IT LIFTED THE BED AND LOOKED BENEATH IT AS THOUGH SHE MIGHT BE
CONCEALED BETWEEN THE PAVEMENT AND THE MATTRESS THEN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND REMAINED STUPEFIED
ALL AT ONCE HE CRUSHED HIS TORCH UNDER HIS
FOOT AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD WITHOUT GIVING VENT TO A SIGH HE
FLUNG HIMSELF AT FULL SPEED HEAD FOREMOST AGAINST THE WALL AND FELL
FAINTING ON THE FLOOR
WHEN HE RECOVERED HIS SENSES HE THREW HIMSELF ON THE BED AND ROLLING
ABOUT HE KISSED FRANTICALLY THE PLACE WHERE THE YOUNG GIRL HAD SLEPT
AND WHICH WAS STILL WARM HE REMAINED THERE FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS AS
MOTIONLESS AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO EXPIRE THEN HE ROSE DRIPPING
WITH PERSPIRATION PANTING MAD AND BEGAN TO BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE
WALL WITH THE FRIGHTFUL REGULARITY OF THE CLAPPER OF HIS BELLS AND
THE RESOLUTION OF A MAN DETERMINED TO KILL HIMSELF
AT LENGTH HE FELL
A SECOND TIME EXHAUSTED HE DRAGGED HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES OUTSIDE THE
CELL AND CROUCHED DOWN FACING THE DOOR IN AN ATTITUDE OF ASTONISHMENT
HE REMAINED THUS FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR WITHOUT MAKING A MOVEMENT WITH
HIS EYE FIXED ON THE DESERTED CELL MORE GLOOMY AND MORE PENSIVE THAN A
MOTHER SEATED BETWEEN AN EMPTY CRADLE AND A FULL COFFIN
HE UTTERED NOT
A WORD ONLY AT LONG INTERVALS A SOB HEAVED HIS BODY VIOLENTLY BUT IT
WAS A TEARLESS SOB LIKE SUMMER LIGHTNING WHICH MAKES NO NOISE
IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THEN THAT SEEKING AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS LONELY
THOUGHTS FOR THE UNEXPECTED ABDUCTOR OF THE GYPSY HE THOUGHT OF THE
ARCHDEACON
HE REMEMBERED THAT DOM CLAUDE ALONE POSSESSED A KEY TO THE
STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE CELL HE RECALLED HIS NOCTURNAL ATTEMPTS ON
THE YOUNG GIRL IN THE FIRST OF WHICH HE QUASIMODO HAD ASSISTED THE
SECOND OF WHICH HE HAD PREVENTED
HE RECALLED A THOUSAND DETAILS AND
SOON HE NO LONGER DOUBTED THAT THE ARCHDEACON HAD TAKEN THE GYPSY
NEVERTHELESS SUCH WAS HIS RESPECT FOR THE PRIEST SUCH HIS GRATITUDE
HIS DEVOTION HIS LOVE FOR THIS MAN HAD TAKEN SUCH DEEP ROOT IN HIS
HEART THAT THEY RESISTED EVEN AT THIS MOMENT THE TALONS OF JEALOUSY
AND DESPAIR
HE REFLECTED THAT THE ARCHDEACON HAD DONE THIS THING AND THE WRATH
OF BLOOD AND DEATH WHICH IT WOULD HAVE EVOKED IN HIM AGAINST ANY OTHER
PERSON TURNED IN THE POOR DEAF MAN FROM THE MOMENT WHEN CLAUDE FROLLO
WAS IN QUESTION INTO AN INCREASE OF GRIEF AND SORROW
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HIS THOUGHT WAS THUS FIXED UPON THE PRIEST WHILE
THE DAYBREAK WAS WHITENING THE FLYING BUTTRESSES HE PERCEIVED ON
THE HIGHEST STORY OF NOTRE DAME AT THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE EXTERNAL
BALUSTRADE AS IT MAKES THE TURN OF THE CHANCEL A FIGURE WALKING
THIS
FIGURE WAS COMING TOWARDS HIM
HE RECOGNIZED IT
IT WAS THE ARCHDEACON
CLAUDE WAS WALKING WITH A SLOW GRAVE STEP
HE DID NOT LOOK BEFORE HIM
AS HE WALKED HE WAS DIRECTING HIS COURSE TOWARDS THE NORTHERN TOWER
BUT HIS FACE WAS TURNED ASIDE TOWARDS THE RIGHT BANK OF THE SEINE AND
HE HELD HIS HEAD HIGH AS THOUGH TRYING TO SEE SOMETHING OVER THE ROOFS
THE OWL OFTEN ASSUMES THIS OBLIQUE ATTITUDE
IT FLIES TOWARDS ONE
POINT AND LOOKS TOWARDS ANOTHER
IN THIS MANNER THE PRIEST PASSED ABOVE
QUASIMODO WITHOUT SEEING HIM
THE DEAF MAN WHO HAD BEEN PETRIFIED BY THIS SUDDEN APPARITION BEHELD
HIM DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE STAIRCASE TO THE NORTH TOWER
THE
READER IS AWARE THAT THIS IS THE TOWER FROM WHICH THE HTEL DE VILLE IS
VISIBLE
QUASIMODO ROSE AND FOLLOWED THE ARCHDEACON
QUASIMODO ASCENDED THE TOWER STAIRCASE FOR THE SAKE OF ASCENDING IT FOR
THE SAKE OF SEEING WHY THE PRIEST WAS ASCENDING IT
MOREOVER THE POOR
BELLRINGER DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE QUASIMODO SHOULD DO WHAT HE
SHOULD SAY WHAT HE WISHED
HE WAS FULL OF FURY AND FULL OF FEAR
THE
ARCHDEACON AND THE GYPSY HAD COME INTO CONFLICT IN HIS HEART
WHEN HE REACHED THE SUMMIT OF THE TOWER BEFORE EMERGING FROM THE SHADOW
OF THE STAIRCASE AND STEPPING UPON THE PLATFORM HE CAUTIOUSLY EXAMINED
THE POSITION OF THE PRIEST
THE PRIEST'S BACK WAS TURNED TO HIM
THERE
IS AN OPENWORK BALUSTRADE WHICH SURROUNDS THE PLATFORM OF THE BELL
TOWER
THE PRIEST WHOSE EYES LOOKED DOWN UPON THE TOWN WAS RESTING HIS
BREAST ON THAT ONE OF THE FOUR SIDES OF THE BALUSTRADES WHICH LOOKS UPON
THE PONT NOTRE DAME
QUASIMODO ADVANCING WITH THE TREAD OF A WOLF BEHIND HIM WENT TO SEE
WHAT HE WAS GAZING AT THUS
THE PRIEST'S ATTENTION WAS SO ABSORBED ELSEWHERE THAT HE DID NOT HEAR
THE DEAF MAN WALKING BEHIND HIM
PARIS IS A MAGNIFICENT AND CHARMING SPECTACLE AND ESPECIALLY AT THAT
DAY VIEWED FROM THE TOP OF THE TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME IN THE FRESH LIGHT
OF A SUMMER DAWN
THE DAY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN JULY
THE SKY WAS PERFECTLY
SERENE
SOME TARDY STARS WERE FADING AWAY AT VARIOUS POINTS AND THERE
WAS A VERY BRILLIANT ONE IN THE EAST IN THE BRIGHTEST PART OF THE
HEAVENS
THE SUN WAS ABOUT TO APPEAR PARIS WAS BEGINNING TO MOVE
A
VERY WHITE AND VERY PURE LIGHT BROUGHT OUT VIVIDLY TO THE EYE ALL THE
OUTLINES THAT ITS THOUSANDS OF HOUSES PRESENT TO THE EAST
THE GIANT
SHADOW OF THE TOWERS LEAPED FROM ROOF TO ROOF FROM ONE END OF THE GREAT
CITY TO THE OTHER
THERE WERE SEVERAL QUARTERS FROM WHICH WERE ALREADY
HEARD VOICES AND NOISY SOUNDS
HERE THE STROKE OF A BELL THERE THE
STROKE OF A HAMMER BEYOND THE COMPLICATED CLATTER OF A CART IN MOTION
ALREADY SEVERAL COLUMNS OF SMOKE WERE BEING BELCHED FORTH FROM THE
CHIMNEYS SCATTERED OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF ROOFS AS THROUGH THE
FISSURES OF AN IMMENSE SULPHUROUS CRATER
THE RIVER WHICH RUFFLES ITS
WATERS AGAINST THE ARCHES OF SO MANY BRIDGES AGAINST THE POINTS OF SO
MANY ISLANDS WAS WAVERING WITH SILVERY FOLDS
AROUND THE CITY OUTSIDE
THE RAMPARTS SIGHT WAS LOST IN A GREAT CIRCLE OF FLEECY VAPORS THROUGH
WHICH ONE CONFUSEDLY DISTINGUISHED THE INDEFINITE LINE OF THE PLAINS
AND THE GRACEFUL SWELL OF THE HEIGHTS
ALL SORTS OF FLOATING SOUNDS WERE
DISPERSED OVER THIS HALF AWAKENED CITY
TOWARDS THE EAST THE MORNING
BREEZE CHASED A FEW SOFT WHITE BITS OF WOOL TORN FROM THE MISTY FLEECE
OF THE HILLS
IN THE PARVIS SOME GOOD WOMEN WHO HAD THEIR MILK JUGS IN THEIR
HANDS WERE POINTING OUT TO EACH OTHER WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SINGULAR
DILAPIDATION OF THE GREAT DOOR OF NOTRE DAME AND THE TWO SOLIDIFIED
STREAMS OF LEAD IN THE CREVICES OF THE STONE
THIS WAS ALL THAT REMAINED
OF THE TEMPEST OF THE NIGHT
THE BONFIRE LIGHTED BETWEEN THE TOWERS BY
QUASIMODO HAD DIED OUT
TRISTAN HAD ALREADY CLEARED UP THE PLACE AND
HAD THE DEAD THROWN INTO THE SEINE
KINGS LIKE LOUIS XI
ARE CAREFUL TO
CLEAN THE PAVEMENT QUICKLY AFTER A MASSACRE
OUTSIDE THE BALUSTRADE OF THE TOWER DIRECTLY UNDER THE POINT WHERE THE
PRIEST HAD PAUSED THERE WAS ONE OF THOSE FANTASTICALLY CARVED STONE
GUTTERS WITH WHICH GOTHIC EDIFICES BRISTLE AND IN A CREVICE OF THAT
GUTTER TWO PRETTY WALLFLOWERS IN BLOSSOM SHAKEN OUT AND VIVIFIED
AS IT WERE BY THE BREATH OF AIR MADE FROLICSOME SALUTATIONS TO EACH
OTHER
ABOVE THE TOWERS ON HIGH FAR AWAY IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SKY THE
CRIES OF LITTLE BIRDS WERE HEARD
BUT THE PRIEST WAS NOT LISTENING TO WAS NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING OF ALL
THIS
HE WAS ONE OF THE MEN FOR WHOM THERE ARE NO MORNINGS NO BIRDS
NO FLOWERS
IN THAT IMMENSE HORIZON WHICH ASSUMED SO MANY ASPECTS ABOUT
HIM HIS CONTEMPLATION WAS CONCENTRATED ON A SINGLE POINT
QUASIMODO WAS BURNING TO ASK HIM WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH THE GYPSY BUT
THE ARCHDEACON SEEMED TO BE OUT OF THE WORLD AT THAT MOMENT
HE WAS
EVIDENTLY IN ONE OF THOSE VIOLENT MOMENTS OF LIFE WHEN ONE WOULD NOT
FEEL THE EARTH CRUMBLE
HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND SILENT WITH HIS EYES
STEADILY FIXED ON A CERTAIN POINT AND THERE WAS SOMETHING SO TERRIBLE
ABOUT THIS SILENCE AND IMMOBILITY THAT THE SAVAGE BELLRINGER SHUDDERED
BEFORE IT AND DARED NOT COME IN CONTACT WITH IT
ONLY AND THIS WAS ALSO
ONE WAY OF INTERROGATING THE ARCHDEACON HE FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION OF
HIS VISION AND IN THIS WAY THE GLANCE OF THE UNHAPPY DEAF MAN FELL UPON
THE PLACE DE GRVE
THUS HE SAW WHAT THE PRIEST WAS LOOKING AT
THE LADDER WAS ERECTED NEAR
THE PERMANENT GALLOWS
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AND MANY SOLDIERS IN
THE PLACE
A MAN WAS DRAGGING A WHITE THING FROM WHICH HUNG SOMETHING
BLACK ALONG THE PAVEMENT
THIS MAN HALTED AT THE FOOT OF THE GALLOWS
HERE SOMETHING TOOK PLACE WHICH QUASIMODO COULD NOT SEE VERY CLEARLY
IT
WAS NOT BECAUSE HIS ONLY EYE HAD NOT PRESERVED ITS LONG RANGE BUT THERE
WAS A GROUP OF SOLDIERS WHICH PREVENTED HIS SEEING EVERYTHING
MOREOVER
AT THAT MOMENT THE SUN APPEARED AND SUCH A FLOOD OF LIGHT OVERFLOWED
THE HORIZON THAT ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT ALL THE POINTS IN PARIS
SPIRES CHIMNEYS GABLES HAD SIMULTANEOUSLY TAKEN FIRE
MEANWHILE THE MAN BEGAN TO MOUNT THE LADDER
THEN QUASIMODO SAW HIM
AGAIN DISTINCTLY
HE WAS CARRYING A WOMAN ON HIS SHOULDER A YOUNG GIRL
DRESSED IN WHITE THAT YOUNG GIRL HAD A NOOSE ABOUT HER NECK
QUASIMODO
RECOGNIZED HER
IT WAS SHE
THE MAN REACHED THE TOP OF THE LADDER
THERE HE ARRANGED THE NOOSE
HERE
THE PRIEST IN ORDER TO SEE THE BETTER KNELT UPON THE BALUSTRADE
ALL AT ONCE THE MAN KICKED AWAY THE LADDER ABRUPTLY AND QUASIMODO WHO
HAD NOT BREATHED FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS BEHELD THE UNHAPPY CHILD DANGLING
AT THE END OF THE ROPE TWO FATHOMS ABOVE THE PAVEMENT WITH THE MAN
SQUATTING ON HER SHOULDERS
THE ROPE MADE SEVERAL GYRATIONS ON ITSELF
AND QUASIMODO BEHELD HORRIBLE CONVULSIONS RUN ALONG THE GYPSY'S BODY
THE PRIEST ON HIS SIDE WITH OUTSTRETCHED NECK AND EYES STARTING FROM
HIS HEAD CONTEMPLATED THIS HORRIBLE GROUP OF THE MAN AND THE YOUNG
GIRL THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS MOST HORRIBLE THE LAUGH OF A DEMON A LAUGH
WHICH ONE CAN ONLY GIVE VENT TO WHEN ONE IS NO LONGER HUMAN BURST FORTH
ON THE PRIEST'S LIVID FACE
QUASIMODO DID NOT HEAR THAT LAUGH BUT HE SAW IT
THE BELLRINGER RETREATED SEVERAL PACES BEHIND THE ARCHDEACON AND
SUDDENLY HURLING HIMSELF UPON HIM WITH FURY WITH HIS HUGE HANDS HE
PUSHED HIM BY THE BACK OVER INTO THE ABYSS OVER WHICH DOM CLAUDE WAS
LEANING
THE PRIEST SHRIEKED DAMNATION AND FELL
THE SPOUT ABOVE WHICH HE HAD STOOD ARRESTED HIM IN HIS FALL
HE CLUNG
TO IT WITH DESPERATE HANDS AND AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH
TO UTTER A SECOND CRY HE BEHELD THE FORMIDABLE AND AVENGING FACE OF
QUASIMODO THRUST OVER THE EDGE OF THE BALUSTRADE ABOVE HIS HEAD
THEN HE WAS SILENT
THE ABYSS WAS THERE BELOW HIM
A FALL OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FEET AND
THE PAVEMENT
IN THIS TERRIBLE SITUATION THE ARCHDEACON SAID NOT A WORD UTTERED NOT
A GROAN
HE MERELY WRITHED UPON THE SPOUT WITH INCREDIBLE EFFORTS TO
CLIMB UP AGAIN BUT HIS HANDS HAD NO HOLD ON THE GRANITE HIS FEET SLID
ALONG THE BLACKENED WALL WITHOUT CATCHING FAST
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ASCENDED
THE TOWERS OF NOTRE DAME KNOW THAT THERE IS A SWELL OF THE STONE
IMMEDIATELY BENEATH THE BALUSTRADE
IT WAS ON THIS RETREATING ANGLE
THAT MISERABLE ARCHDEACON EXHAUSTED HIMSELF
HE HAD NOT TO DEAL WITH A
PERPENDICULAR WALL BUT WITH ONE WHICH SLOPED AWAY BENEATH HIM
QUASIMODO HAD BUT TO STRETCH OUT HIS HAND IN ORDER TO DRAW HIM FROM THE
GULF BUT HE DID NOT EVEN LOOK AT HIM
HE WAS LOOKING AT THE GRVE
HE
WAS LOOKING AT THE GALLOWS
HE WAS LOOKING AT THE GYPSY
THE DEAF MAN WAS LEANING WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE BALUSTRADE AT THE
SPOT WHERE THE ARCHDEACON HAD BEEN A MOMENT BEFORE AND THERE NEVER
DETACHING HIS GAZE FROM THE ONLY OBJECT WHICH EXISTED FOR HIM IN THE
WORLD AT THAT MOMENT HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND MUTE LIKE A MAN STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING AND A LONG STREAM OF TEARS FLOWED IN SILENCE FROM THAT EYE
WHICH UP TO THAT TIME HAD NEVER SHED BUT ONE TEAR
MEANWHILE THE ARCHDEACON WAS PANTING
HIS BALD BROW WAS DRIPPING WITH
PERSPIRATION HIS NAILS WERE BLEEDING AGAINST THE STONES HIS KNEES WERE
FLAYED BY THE WALL
HE HEARD HIS CASSOCK WHICH WAS CAUGHT ON THE SPOUT CRACK AND RIP AT
EVERY JERK THAT HE GAVE IT
TO COMPLETE HIS MISFORTUNE THIS SPOUT ENDED
IN A LEADEN PIPE WHICH BENT UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HIS BODY
THE ARCHDEACON
FELT THIS PIPE SLOWLY GIVING WAY
THE MISERABLE MAN SAID TO HIMSELF
THAT WHEN HIS HANDS SHOULD BE WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE WHEN HIS CASSOCK
SHOULD TEAR ASUNDER WHEN THE LEAD SHOULD GIVE WAY HE WOULD BE OBLIGED
TO FALL AND TERROR SEIZED UPON HIS VERY VITALS
NOW AND THEN HE GLANCED
WILDLY AT A SORT OF NARROW SHELF FORMED TEN FEET LOWER DOWN BY
PROJECTIONS OF THE SCULPTURE AND HE PRAYED HEAVEN FROM THE DEPTHS OF
HIS DISTRESSED SOUL THAT HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO FINISH HIS LIFE WERE
IT TO LAST TWO CENTURIES ON THAT SPACE TWO FEET SQUARE
ONCE HE
GLANCED BELOW HIM INTO THE PLACE INTO THE ABYSS THE HEAD WHICH HE
RAISED AGAIN HAD ITS EYES CLOSED AND ITS HAIR STANDING ERECT
THERE WAS SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL IN THE SILENCE OF THESE TWO MEN
WHILE
THE ARCHDEACON AGONIZED IN THIS TERRIBLE FASHION A FEW FEET BELOW HIM
QUASIMODO WEPT AND GAZED AT THE GRVE
THE ARCHDEACON SEEING THAT ALL HIS EXERTIONS SERVED ONLY TO WEAKEN THE
FRAGILE SUPPORT WHICH REMAINED TO HIM DECIDED TO REMAIN QUIET
THERE HE
HUNG EMBRACING THE GUTTER HARDLY BREATHING NO LONGER STIRRING MAKING
NO LONGER ANY OTHER MOVEMENTS THAN THAT MECHANICAL CONVULSION OF THE
STOMACH WHICH ONE EXPERIENCES IN DREAMS WHEN ONE FANCIES HIMSELF
FALLING
HIS FIXED EYES WERE WIDE OPEN WITH A STARE
HE LOST GROUND
LITTLE BY LITTLE NEVERTHELESS HIS FINGERS SLIPPED ALONG THE SPOUT
HE BECAME MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE FEEBLENESS OF HIS ARMS AND THE
WEIGHT OF HIS BODY
THE CURVE OF THE LEAD WHICH SUSTAINED HIM INCLINED
MORE AND MORE EACH INSTANT TOWARDS THE ABYSS
HE BEHELD BELOW HIM A FRIGHTFUL THING THE ROOF OF SAINT JEAN LE ROND
AS SMALL AS A CARD FOLDED IN TWO
HE GAZED AT THE IMPRESSIVE CARVINGS
ONE BY ONE OF THE TOWER SUSPENDED LIKE HIMSELF OVER THE PRECIPICE BUT
WITHOUT TERROR FOR THEMSELVES OR PITY FOR HIM
ALL WAS STONE AROUND HIM
BEFORE HIS EYES GAPING MONSTERS BELOW QUITE AT THE BOTTOM IN THE
PLACE THE PAVEMENT ABOVE HIS HEAD QUASIMODO WEEPING
IN THE PARVIS THERE WERE SEVERAL GROUPS OF CURIOUS GOOD PEOPLE WHO WERE
TRANQUILLY SEEKING TO DIVINE WHO THE MADMAN COULD BE WHO WAS AMUSING
HIMSELF IN SO STRANGE A MANNER
THE PRIEST HEARD THEM SAYING FOR THEIR
VOICES REACHED HIM CLEAR AND SHRILL WHY HE WILL BREAK HIS NECK
QUASIMODO WEPT
AT LAST THE ARCHDEACON FOAMING WITH RAGE AND DESPAIR UNDERSTOOD THAT
ALL WAS IN VAIN
NEVERTHELESS HE COLLECTED ALL THE STRENGTH WHICH
REMAINED TO HIM FOR A FINAL EFFORT
HE STIFFENED HIMSELF UPON THE SPOUT
PUSHED AGAINST THE WALL WITH BOTH HIS KNEES CLUNG TO A CREVICE IN THE
STONES WITH HIS HANDS AND SUCCEEDED IN CLIMBING BACK WITH ONE FOOT
PERHAPS BUT THIS EFFORT MADE THE LEADEN BEAK ON WHICH HE RESTED
BEND ABRUPTLY
HIS CASSOCK BURST OPEN AT THE SAME TIME
THEN FEELING
EVERYTHING GIVE WAY BENEATH HIM WITH NOTHING BUT HIS STIFFENED AND
FAILING HANDS TO SUPPORT HIM THE UNFORTUNATE MAN CLOSED HIS EYES AND
LET GO OF THE SPOUT
HE FELL
QUASIMODO WATCHED HIM FALL
A FALL FROM SUCH A HEIGHT IS SELDOM PERPENDICULAR
THE ARCHDEACON
LAUNCHED INTO SPACE FELL AT FIRST HEAD FOREMOST WITH OUTSPREAD HANDS
THEN HE WHIRLED OVER AND OVER MANY TIMES THE WIND BLEW HIM UPON
THE ROOF OF A HOUSE WHERE THE UNFORTUNATE MAN BEGAN TO BREAK UP
NEVERTHELESS HE WAS NOT DEAD WHEN HE REACHED THERE
THE BELLRINGER SAW
HIM STILL ENDEAVOR TO CLING TO A GABLE WITH HIS NAILS BUT THE SURFACE
SLOPED TOO MUCH AND HE HAD NO MORE STRENGTH
HE SLID RAPIDLY ALONG THE
ROOF LIKE A LOOSENED TILE AND DASHED UPON THE PAVEMENT
THERE HE NO
LONGER MOVED
THEN QUASIMODO RAISED HIS EYES TO THE GYPSY WHOSE BODY HE BEHELD
HANGING FROM THE GIBBET QUIVERING FAR AWAY BENEATH HER WHITE ROBE WITH
THE LAST SHUDDERINGS OF ANGUISH THEN HE DROPPED THEM ON THE ARCHDEACON
STRETCHED OUT AT THE BASE OF THE TOWER AND NO LONGER RETAINING THE
HUMAN FORM AND HE SAID WITH A SOB WHICH HEAVED HIS DEEP CHEST OH
ALL THAT I HAVE EVER LOVED
CHAPTER III
THE MARRIAGE OF PHOEBUS
TOWARDS EVENING ON THAT DAY WHEN THE JUDICIARY OFFICERS OF THE BISHOP
CAME TO PICK UP FROM THE PAVEMENT OF THE PARVIS THE DISLOCATED CORPSE OF
THE ARCHDEACON QUASIMODO HAD DISAPPEARED
A GREAT MANY RUMORS WERE IN CIRCULATION WITH REGARD TO THIS ADVENTURE
NO ONE DOUBTED BUT THAT THE DAY HAD COME WHEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR
COMPACT QUASIMODO THAT IS TO SAY THE DEVIL WAS TO CARRY OFF CLAUDE
FROLLO THAT IS TO SAY THE SORCERER
IT WAS PRESUMED THAT HE HAD BROKEN
THE BODY WHEN TAKING THE SOUL LIKE MONKEYS WHO BREAK THE SHELL TO GET
AT THE NUT
THIS IS WHY THE ARCHDEACON WAS NOT INTERRED IN CONSECRATED EARTH
LOUIS XI
DIED A YEAR LATER IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1483
AS FOR PIERRE GRINGOIRE HE SUCCEEDED IN SAVING THE GOAT AND HE WON
SUCCESS IN TRAGEDY
IT APPEARS THAT AFTER HAVING TASTED ASTROLOGY
PHILOSOPHY ARCHITECTURE HERMETICS ALL VANITIES HE RETURNED TO
TRAGEDY VAINEST PURSUIT OF ALL
THIS IS WHAT HE CALLED COMING TO A
TRAGIC END THIS IS WHAT IS TO BE READ ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS DRAMATIC
TRIUMPHS IN 1483 IN THE ACCOUNTS OF THE ORDINARY TO JEHAN MARCHAND
AND PIERRE GRINGOIRE CARPENTER AND COMPOSER WHO HAVE MADE AND COMPOSED
THE MYSTERY MADE AT THE CHTELET OF PARIS AT THE ENTRY OF MONSIEUR THE
LEGATE AND HAVE ORDERED THE PERSONAGES CLOTHED AND DRESSED THE SAME
AS IN THE SAID MYSTERY WAS REQUIRED AND LIKEWISE FOR HAVING MADE THE
SCAFFOLDINGS THERETO NECESSARY AND FOR THIS DEED ONE HUNDRED LIVRES
PHOEBUS DE CHTEAUPERS ALSO CAME TO A TRAGIC END
HE MARRIED
CHAPTER IV
THE MARRIAGE OF QUASIMODO
WE HAVE JUST SAID THAT QUASIMODO DISAPPEARED FROM NOTRE DAME ON THE DAY
OF THE GYPSY'S AND OF THE ARCHDEACON'S DEATH
HE WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN IN
FACT NO ONE KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM
DURING THE NIGHT WHICH FOLLOWED THE EXECUTION OF LA ESMERALDA THE NIGHT
MEN HAD DETACHED HER BODY FROM THE GIBBET AND HAD CARRIED IT ACCORDING
TO CUSTOM TO THE CELLAR OF MONTFAUON
MONTFAUON WAS AS SAUVAL SAYS THE MOST ANCIENT AND THE MOST SUPERB
GIBBET IN THE KINGDOM BETWEEN THE FAUBOURGS OF THE TEMPLE AND SAINT
MARTIN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TOISES FROM THE WALLS OF PARIS A
FEW BOW SHOTS FROM LA COURTILLE THERE WAS TO BE SEEN ON THE CREST OF A
GENTLE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE EMINENCE BUT SUFFICIENTLY ELEVATED TO
BE SEEN FOR SEVERAL LEAGUES ROUND ABOUT AN EDIFICE OF STRANGE FORM
BEARING CONSIDERABLE RESEMBLANCE TO A CELTIC CROMLECH AND WHERE ALSO
HUMAN SACRIFICES WERE OFFERED
LET THE READER PICTURE TO HIMSELF CROWNING A LIMESTONE HILLOCK AN
OBLONG MASS OF MASONRY FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT THIRTY WIDE FORTY
LONG WITH A GATE AN EXTERNAL RAILING AND A PLATFORM ON THIS PLATFORM
SIXTEEN ENORMOUS PILLARS OF ROUGH HEWN STONE THIRTY FEET IN HEIGHT
ARRANGED IN A COLONNADE ROUND THREE OF THE FOUR SIDES OF THE MASS WHICH
SUPPORT THEM BOUND TOGETHER AT THEIR SUMMITS BY HEAVY BEAMS WHENCE
HUNG CHAINS AT INTERVALS ON ALL THESE CHAINS SKELETONS IN THE
VICINITY ON THE PLAIN A STONE CROSS AND TWO GIBBETS OF SECONDARY
IMPORTANCE WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE SPRUNG UP AS SHOOTS AROUND THE CENTRAL
GALLOWS ABOVE ALL THIS IN THE SKY A PERPETUAL FLOCK OF CROWS THAT
WAS MONTFAUON
AT THE END OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY THE FORMIDABLE GIBBET WHICH DATED
FROM 1328 WAS ALREADY VERY MUCH DILAPIDATED THE BEAMS WERE WORMEATEN
THE CHAINS RUSTED THE PILLARS GREEN WITH MOULD THE LAYERS OF HEWN
STONE WERE ALL CRACKED AT THEIR JOINTS AND GRASS WAS GROWING ON THAT
PLATFORM WHICH NO FEET TOUCHED
THE MONUMENT MADE A HORRIBLE PROFILE
AGAINST THE SKY ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT WHEN THERE WAS A LITTLE MOONLIGHT
ON THOSE WHITE SKULLS OR WHEN THE BREEZE OF EVENING BRUSHED THE CHAINS
AND THE SKELETONS AND SWAYED ALL THESE IN THE DARKNESS
THE PRESENCE OF
THIS GIBBET SUFFICED TO RENDER GLOOMY ALL THE SURROUNDING PLACES
THE MASS OF MASONRY WHICH SERVED AS FOUNDATION TO THE ODIOUS EDIFICE WAS
HOLLOW
A HUGE CELLAR HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED THERE CLOSED BY AN OLD IRON
GRATING WHICH WAS OUT OF ORDER INTO WHICH WERE CAST NOT ONLY THE HUMAN
REMAINS WHICH WERE TAKEN FROM THE CHAINS OF MONTFAUON BUT ALSO THE
BODIES OF ALL THE UNFORTUNATES EXECUTED ON THE OTHER PERMANENT GIBBETS
OF PARIS
TO THAT DEEP CHARNEL HOUSE WHERE SO MANY HUMAN REMAINS AND SO
MANY CRIMES HAVE ROTTED IN COMPANY MANY GREAT ONES OF THIS WORLD
MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED THEIR BONES FROM ENGUERRAND DE
MARIGNI THE FIRST VICTIM AND A JUST MAN TO ADMIRAL DE COLIGNI WHO
WAS ITS LAST AND WHO WAS ALSO A JUST MAN
AS FOR THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF QUASIMODO THIS IS ALL THAT WE
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER
ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR TWO YEARS AFTER THE EVENTS WHICH TERMINATE THIS
STORY WHEN SEARCH WAS MADE IN THAT CAVERN FOR THE BODY OF OLIVIER LE
DAIM WHO HAD BEEN HANGED TWO DAYS PREVIOUSLY AND TO WHOM CHARLES
VIII
HAD GRANTED THE FAVOR OF BEING BURIED IN SAINT LAURENT IN BETTER
COMPANY THEY FOUND AMONG ALL THOSE HIDEOUS CARCASSES TWO SKELETONS ONE
OF WHICH HELD THE OTHER IN ITS EMBRACE
ONE OF THESE SKELETONS WHICH
WAS THAT OF A WOMAN STILL HAD A FEW STRIPS OF A GARMENT WHICH HAD ONCE
BEEN WHITE AND AROUND HER NECK WAS TO BE SEEN A STRING OF ADRZARACH
BEADS WITH A LITTLE SILK BAG ORNAMENTED WITH GREEN GLASS WHICH WAS OPEN
AND EMPTY
THESE OBJECTS WERE OF SO LITTLE VALUE THAT THE EXECUTIONER
HAD PROBABLY NOT CARED FOR THEM
THE OTHER WHICH HELD THIS ONE IN A
CLOSE EMBRACE WAS THE SKELETON OF A MAN
IT WAS NOTICED THAT HIS SPINAL
COLUMN WAS CROOKED HIS HEAD SEATED ON HIS SHOULDER BLADES AND THAT ONE
LEG WAS SHORTER THAN THE OTHER
MOREOVER THERE WAS NO FRACTURE OF THE
VERTEBRAE AT THE NAPE OF THE NECK AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD NOT
BEEN HANGED
HENCE THE MAN TO WHOM IT HAD BELONGED HAD COME THITHER AND
HAD DIED THERE
WHEN THEY TRIED TO DETACH THE SKELETON WHICH HE HELD IN
HIS EMBRACE HE FELL TO DUST
NOTE
ADDED TO THE DEFINITIVE EDITION
IT IS BY MISTAKE THAT THIS EDITION WAS ANNOUNCED AS AUGMENTED BY MANY
NEW CHAPTERS
THE WORD SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNPUBLISHED
IN FACT IF BY NEW
NEWLY MADE IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD THE CHAPTERS ADDED TO THIS EDITION ARE
NOT NEW
THEY WERE WRITTEN AT THE SAME TIME AS THE REST OF THE WORK
THEY DATE FROM THE SAME EPOCH AND SPRANG FROM THE SAME THOUGHT THEY
HAVE ALWAYS FORMED A PART OF THE MANUSCRIPT OF NOTRE DAME DE PARIS
MOREOVER THE AUTHOR CANNOT COMPREHEND HOW FRESH DEVELOPMENTS COULD BE
ADDED TO A WORK OF THIS CHARACTER AFTER ITS COMPLETION
THIS IS NOT TO
BE DONE AT WILL
ACCORDING TO HIS IDEA A ROMANCE IS BORN IN A MANNER
THAT IS IN SOME SORT NECESSARY WITH ALL ITS CHAPTERS A DRAMA IS BORN
WITH ALL ITS SCENES
THINK NOT THAT THERE IS ANYTHING ARBITRARY IN THE
NUMBERS OF PARTS OF WHICH THAT WHOLE THAT MYSTERIOUS MICROCOSM WHICH
YOU CALL A DRAMA OR A ROMANCE IS COMPOSED
GRAFTING AND SOLDERING
TAKE BADLY ON WORKS OF THIS NATURE WHICH SHOULD GUSH FORTH IN A SINGLE
STREAM AND SO REMAIN
THE THING ONCE DONE DO NOT CHANGE YOUR MIND DO
NOT TOUCH IT UP
THE BOOK ONCE PUBLISHED THE SEX OF THE WORK WHETHER
VIRILE OR NOT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AND PROCLAIMED WHEN THE CHILD HAS
ONCE UTTERED HIS FIRST CRY HE IS BORN THERE HE IS HE IS MADE SO
NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER CAN DO ANYTHING HE BELONGS TO THE AIR AND
TO THE SUN LET HIM LIVE OR DIE SUCH AS HE IS
HAS YOUR BOOK BEEN A
FAILURE SO MUCH THE WORSE
ADD NO CHAPTERS TO AN UNSUCCESSFUL BOOK
IS
IT INCOMPLETE YOU SHOULD HAVE COMPLETED IT WHEN YOU CONCEIVED IT
IS YOUR TREE CROOKED YOU CANNOT STRAIGHTEN IT UP
IS YOUR ROMANCE
CONSUMPTIVE IS YOUR ROMANCE NOT CAPABLE OF LIVING YOU CANNOT SUPPLY IT
WITH THE BREATH WHICH IT LACKS
HAS YOUR DRAMA BEEN BORN LAME TAKE MY
ADVICE AND DO NOT PROVIDE IT WITH A WOODEN LEG
HENCE THE AUTHOR ATTACHES PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE PUBLIC KNOWING
FOR A CERTAINTY THAT THE CHAPTERS HERE ADDED HAVE NOT BEEN MADE
EXPRESSLY FOR THIS REPRINT
THEY WERE NOT PUBLISHED IN THE PRECEDING
EDITIONS OF THE BOOK FOR A VERY SIMPLE REASON
AT THE TIME WHEN
NOTRE DAME DE PARIS WAS PRINTED THE FIRST TIME THE MANUSCRIPT OF
THESE THREE CHAPTERS HAD BEEN MISLAID
IT WAS NECESSARY TO REWRITE THEM
OR TO DISPENSE WITH THEM
THE AUTHOR CONSIDERED THAT THE ONLY TWO OF
THESE CHAPTERS WHICH WERE IN THE LEAST IMPORTANT OWING TO THEIR EXTENT
WERE CHAPTERS ON ART AND HISTORY WHICH IN NO WAY INTERFERED WITH THE
GROUNDWORK OF THE DRAMA AND THE ROMANCE THAT THE PUBLIC WOULD NOT
NOTICE THEIR LOSS AND THAT HE THE AUTHOR WOULD ALONE BE IN POSSESSION
OF THE SECRET
HE DECIDED TO OMIT THEM AND THEN IF THE WHOLE TRUTH
MUST BE CONFESSED HIS INDOLENCE SHRUNK FROM THE TASK OF REWRITING THE
THREE LOST CHAPTERS
HE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT A SHORTER MATTER TO MAKE A
NEW ROMANCE
NOW THE CHAPTERS HAVE BEEN FOUND AND HE AVAILS HIMSELF OF THE FIRST
OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE THEM TO THEIR PLACE
THIS NOW IS HIS ENTIRE WORK SUCH AS HE DREAMED IT SUCH AS HE MADE IT
GOOD OR BAD DURABLE OR FRAGILE BUT SUCH AS HE WISHES IT
THESE RECOVERED CHAPTERS WILL POSSESS NO DOUBT BUT LITTLE VALUE IN
THE EYES OF PERSONS OTHERWISE VERY JUDICIOUS WHO HAVE SOUGHT IN
NOTRE DAME DE PARIS ONLY THE DRAMA THE ROMANCE
BUT THERE ARE
PERCHANCE OTHER READERS WHO HAVE NOT FOUND IT USELESS TO STUDY THE
AESTHETIC AND PHILOSOPHIC THOUGHT CONCEALED IN THIS BOOK AND WHO HAVE
TAKEN PLEASURE WHILE READING NOTRE DAME DE PARIS IN UNRAVELLING
BENEATH THE ROMANCE SOMETHING ELSE THAN THE ROMANCE AND IN FOLLOWING
MAY WE BE PARDONED THESE RATHER AMBITIOUS EXPRESSIONS THE SYSTEM
OF THE HISTORIAN AND THE AIM OF THE ARTIST THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE
POET
FOR SUCH PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE CHAPTERS ADDED TO THIS EDITION WILL
COMPLETE NOTRE DAME DE PARIS IF WE ADMIT THAT NOTRE DAME DE PARIS
WAS WORTH THE TROUBLE OF COMPLETING
IN ONE OF THESE CHAPTERS ON THE PRESENT DECADENCE OF ARCHITECTURE AND
ON THE DEATH IN HIS MIND ALMOST INEVITABLE OF THAT KING OF ARTS THE
AUTHOR EXPRESSES AND DEVELOPS AN OPINION UNFORTUNATELY WELL ROOTED IN
HIM AND WELL THOUGHT OUT
BUT HE FEELS IT NECESSARY TO SAY HERE THAT HE
EARNESTLY DESIRES THAT THE FUTURE MAY SOME DAY PUT HIM IN THE WRONG
HE KNOWS THAT ART IN ALL ITS FORMS HAS EVERYTHING TO HOPE FROM THE NEW
GENERATIONS WHOSE GENIUS STILL IN THE GERM CAN BE HEARD GUSHING FORTH
IN OUR STUDIOS
THE GRAIN IS IN THE FURROW THE HARVEST WILL CERTAINLY
BE FINE
HE MERELY FEARS AND THE REASON MAY BE SEEN IN THE SECOND
VOLUME OF THIS EDITION THAT THE SAP MAY HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM THAT
ANCIENT SOIL OF ARCHITECTURE WHICH HAS BEEN FOR SO MANY CENTURIES THE
BEST FIELD FOR ART
NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE TO DAY IN THE ARTISTIC YOUTH SO MUCH LIFE
POWER AND SO TO SPEAK PREDESTINATION THAT IN OUR SCHOOLS OF
ARCHITECTURE IN PARTICULAR AT THE PRESENT TIME THE PROFESSORS WHO
ARE DETESTABLE PRODUCE NOT ONLY UNCONSCIOUSLY BUT EVEN IN SPITE OF
THEMSELVES EXCELLENT PUPILS QUITE THE REVERSE OF THAT POTTER MENTIONED
BY HORACE WHO DREAMED AMPHORAE AND PRODUCED POTS
CURRIT ROTA URCENS
EXIT
BUT IN ANY CASE WHATEVER MAY BE THE FUTURE OF ARCHITECTURE IN
WHATEVER MANNER OUR YOUNG ARCHITECTS MAY ONE DAY SOLVE THE QUESTION OF
THEIR ART LET US WHILE WAITING FOR NEW MONUMENT PRESERVE THE ANCIENT
MONUMENTS
LET US IF POSSIBLE INSPIRE THE NATION WITH A LOVE FOR
NATIONAL ARCHITECTURE
THAT THE AUTHOR DECLARES IS ONE OF THE
PRINCIPAL AIMS OF THIS BOOK IT IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL AIMS OF HIS
LIFE
NOTRE DAME DE PARIS HAS PERHAPS OPENED SOME TRUE PERSPECTIVES ON THE
ART OF THE MIDDLE AGES ON THAT MARVELLOUS ART WHICH UP TO THE PRESENT
TIME HAS BEEN UNKNOWN TO SOME AND WHAT IS WORSE MISKNOWN BY OTHERS
BUT THE AUTHOR IS FAR FROM REGARDING AS ACCOMPLISHED THE TASK WHICH HE
HAS VOLUNTARILY IMPOSED ON HIMSELF
HE HAS ALREADY PLEADED ON MORE THAN
ONE OCCASION THE CAUSE OF OUR ANCIENT ARCHITECTURE HE HAS ALREADY
LOUDLY DENOUNCED MANY PROFANATIONS MANY DEMOLITIONS MANY IMPIETIES
HE
WILL NOT GROW WEARY
HE HAS PROMISED HIMSELF TO RECUR FREQUENTLY TO THIS
SUBJECT
HE WILL RETURN TO IT
HE WILL BE AS INDEFATIGABLE IN DEFENDING
OUR HISTORICAL EDIFICES AS OUR ICONOCLASTS OF THE SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES
ARE EAGER IN ATTACKING THEM FOR IT IS A GRIEVOUS THING TO SEE INTO
WHAT HANDS THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE MIDDLE AGES HAS FALLEN AND IN WHAT A
MANNER THE BOTCHERS OF PLASTER OF THE PRESENT DAY TREAT THE RUIN OF THIS
GRAND ART IT IS EVEN A SHAME FOR US INTELLIGENT MEN WHO SEE THEM AT
WORK AND CONTENT OURSELVES WITH HOOTING THEM
AND WE ARE NOT SPEAKING
HERE MERELY OF WHAT GOES ON IN THE PROVINCES BUT OF WHAT IS DONE IN
PARIS AT OUR VERY DOORS BENEATH OUR WINDOWS IN THE GREAT CITY IN THE
LETTERED CITY IN THE CITY OF THE PRESS OF WORD OF THOUGHT
WE CANNOT
RESIST THE IMPULSE TO POINT OUT IN CONCLUDING THIS NOTE SOME OF
THE ACTS OF VANDALISM WHICH ARE EVERY DAY PLANNED DEBATED BEGUN
CONTINUED AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED UNDER THE EYES OF THE ARTISTIC
PUBLIC OF PARIS FACE TO FACE WITH CRITICISM WHICH IS DISCONCERTED BY
SO MUCH AUDACITY
AN ARCHBISHOP'S PALACE HAS JUST BEEN DEMOLISHED AN
EDIFICE IN POOR TASTE NO GREAT HARM IS DONE BUT IN A BLOCK WITH THE
ARCHIEPISCOPAL PALACE A BISHOP'S PALACE HAS BEEN DEMOLISHED A RARE
FRAGMENT OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY WHICH THE DEMOLISHING ARCHITECT
COULD NOT DISTINGUISH FROM THE REST
HE HAS TORN UP THE WHEAT WITH
THE TARES 'TIS ALL THE SAME
THEY ARE TALKING OF RAZING THE
ADMIRABLE CHAPEL OF VINCENNES IN ORDER TO MAKE WITH ITS STONES SOME
FORTIFICATION WHICH DAUMESNIL DID NOT NEED HOWEVER
WHILE THE PALAIS
BOURBON THAT WRETCHED EDIFICE IS BEING REPAIRED AT GREAT EXPENSE
GUSTS OF WIND AND EQUINOCTIAL STORMS ARE ALLOWED TO DESTROY THE
MAGNIFICENT PAINTED WINDOWS OF THE SAINTE CHAPELLE
FOR THE LAST FEW
DAYS THERE HAS BEEN A SCAFFOLDING ON THE TOWER OF SAINT JACQUES DE LA
BOUCHERIE AND ONE OF THESE MORNINGS THE PICK WILL BE LAID TO IT
A
MASON HAS BEEN FOUND TO BUILD A LITTLE WHITE HOUSE BETWEEN THE VENERABLE
TOWERS OF THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE
ANOTHER HAS BEEN FOUND WILLING TO PRUNE
AWAY SAINT GERMAIN DES PRES THE FEUDAL ABBEY WITH THREE BELL TOWERS
ANOTHER WILL BE FOUND NO DOUBT CAPABLE OF PULLING DOWN SAINT GERMAIN
L'AUXERROIS
ALL THESE MASONS CLAIM TO BE ARCHITECTS ARE PAID BY THE
PREFECTURE OR FROM THE PETTY BUDGET AND WEAR GREEN COATS
ALL THE HARM
WHICH FALSE TASTE CAN INFLICT ON GOOD TASTE THEY ACCOMPLISH
WHILE
WE WRITE DEPLORABLE SPECTACLE ONE OF THEM HOLDS POSSESSION OF THE
TUILERIES ONE OF THEM IS GIVING PHILIBERT DELORME A SCAR ACROSS THE
MIDDLE OF HIS FACE AND IT IS NOT ASSUREDLY ONE OF THE LEAST OF THE
SCANDALS OF OUR TIME TO SEE WITH WHAT EFFRONTERY THE HEAVY ARCHITECTURE
OF THIS GENTLEMAN IS BEING FLATTENED OVER ONE OF THE MOST DELICATE
FAADES OF THE RENAISSANCE
