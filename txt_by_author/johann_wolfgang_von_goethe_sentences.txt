ILLUSTRATION PREFACE
IT IS TWENTY YEARS SINCE I FIRST DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT THE TRANSLATION
OF FAUST IN THE ORIGINAL METRES
AT THAT TIME ALTHOUGH MORE THAN A
SCORE OF ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS OF THE FIRST PART AND THREE OR FOUR OF
THE SECOND PART WERE IN EXISTENCE THE EXPERIMENT HAD NOT YET BEEN
MADE
THE PROSE VERSION OF HAYWARD SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AS THE
STANDARD IN DEFAULT OF ANYTHING MORE SATISFACTORY THE ENGLISH CRITICS
GENERALLY SUSTAINING THE TRANSLATOR IN HIS VIEWS CONCERNING THE
SECONDARY IMPORTANCE OF FORM IN POETRY PRACTICALLY DISCOURAGED ANY
FURTHER ATTEMPT AND NO ONE FAMILIAR WITH RHYTHMICAL EXPRESSION THROUGH
THE NEEDS OF HIS OWN NATURE HAD DEVOTED THE NECESSARY LOVE AND PATIENCE
TO AN ADEQUATE REPRODUCTION OF THE GREAT WORK OF GOETHE'S LIFE
MR
BROOKS WAS THE FIRST TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK AND THE PUBLICATION OF
HIS TRANSLATION OF THE FIRST PART IN 1856 INDUCED ME FOR A TIME TO
GIVE UP MY OWN DESIGN
NO PREVIOUS ENGLISH VERSION EXHIBITED SUCH
ABNEGATION OF THE TRANSLATOR'S OWN TASTES AND HABITS OF THOUGHT SUCH
REVERENT DESIRE TO PRESENT THE ORIGINAL IN ITS PUREST FORM
THE CARE AND
CONSCIENCE WITH WHICH THE WORK HAD BEEN PERFORMED WERE SO APPARENT THAT
I NOW STATE WITH RELUCTANCE WHAT THEN SEEMED TO ME TO BE ITS ONLY
DEFICIENCIES A LACK OF THE LYRICAL FIRE AND FLUENCY OF THE ORIGINAL IN
SOME PASSAGES AND AN OCCASIONAL LOWERING OF THE TONE THROUGH THE USE OF
WORDS WHICH ARE LITERAL BUT NOT EQUIVALENT
THE PLAN OF TRANSLATION
ADOPTED BY MR
BROOKS WAS SO ENTIRELY MY OWN THAT WHEN FURTHER
RESIDENCE IN GERMANY AND A MORE CAREFUL STUDY OF BOTH PARTS OF FAUST
HAD SATISFIED ME THAT THE FIELD WAS STILL OPEN THAT THE MEANS
FURNISHED BY THE POETICAL AFFINITY OF THE TWO LANGUAGES HAD NOT YET BEEN
EXHAUSTED NOTHING REMAINED FOR ME BUT TO FOLLOW HIM IN ALL ESSENTIAL
PARTICULARS
HIS EXAMPLE CONFIRMED ME IN THE BELIEF THAT THERE WERE FEW
DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF A NEARLY LITERAL YET THOROUGHLY RHYTHMICAL
VERSION OF FAUST WHICH MIGHT NOT BE OVERCOME BY LOVING LABOR
A
COMPARISON OF SEVENTEEN ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS IN THE ARBITRARY METRES
ADOPTED BY THE TRANSLATORS SUFFICIENTLY SHOWED THE DANGER OF ALLOWING
LICENSE IN THIS RESPECT THE WHITE LIGHT OF GOETHE'S THOUGHT WAS THEREBY
PASSED THROUGH THE TINTED GLASS OF OTHER MINDS AND ASSUMED THE COLORING
OF EACH
MOREOVER THE PLEA OF SELECTING DIFFERENT METRES IN THE HOPE OF
PRODUCING A SIMILAR EFFECT IS UNREASONABLE WHERE THE IDENTICAL METRES
ARE POSSIBLE
THE VALUE OF FORM IN A POETICAL WORK IS THE FIRST QUESTION TO BE
CONSIDERED
NO POET EVER UNDERSTOOD THIS QUESTION MORE THOROUGHLY THAN
GOETHE HIMSELF OR EXPRESSED A MORE POSITIVE OPINION IN REGARD TO IT
THE ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSLATION WHICH HE PRESENTS REPORTED BY
RIEMER QUOTED BY MRS
AUSTIN IN HER CHARACTERISTICS OF GOETHE AND
ACCEPTED BY MR
HAYWARD A ARE QUITE INDEPENDENT OF HIS VIEWS
CONCERNING THE VALUE OF FORM WHICH WE FIND GIVEN ELSEWHERE IN THE
CLEAREST AND MOST EMPHATIC MANNER B POETRY IS NOT SIMPLY A FASHION OF
EXPRESSION IT IS THE FORM OF EXPRESSION ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED BY A
CERTAIN CLASS OF IDEAS
POETRY INDEED MAY BE DISTINGUISHED FROM PROSE
BY THE SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IT IS THE UTTERANCE OF WHATEVER IN MAN
CANNOT BE PERFECTLY UTTERED IN ANY OTHER THAN A RHYTHMICAL FORM IT IS
USELESS TO SAY THAT THE NAKED MEANING IS INDEPENDENT OF THE FORM ON THE
CONTRARY THE FORM CONTRIBUTES ESSENTIALLY TO THE FULLNESS OF THE
MEANING
IN POETRY WHICH ENDURES THROUGH ITS OWN INHERENT VITALITY
THERE IS NO FORCED UNION OF THESE TWO ELEMENTS
THEY ARE AS INTIMATELY
BLENDED AND WITH THE SAME MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY AS THE SEXES IN THE
ANCIENT HERMAPHRODITUS
TO ATTEMPT TO REPRESENT POETRY IN PROSE IS VERY
MUCH LIKE ATTEMPTING TO TRANSLATE MUSIC INTO SPEECH C
A 'THERE ARE TWO MAXIMS OF TRANSLATION SAYS HE 'THE ONE REQUIRES
THAT THE AUTHOR OF A FOREIGN NATION BE BROUGHT TO US IN SUCH A MANNER
THAT WE MAY REGARD HIM AS OUR OWN THE OTHER ON THE CONTRARY DEMANDS
OF US THAT WE TRANSPORT OURSELVES OVER TO HIM AND ADOPT HIS SITUATION
HIS MODE OF SPEAKING AND HIS PECULIARITIES
THE ADVANTAGES OF BOTH ARE
SUFFICIENTLY KNOWN TO ALL INSTRUCTED PERSONS FROM MASTERLY EXAMPLES
IS IT NECESSARY HOWEVER THAT THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE THIS ALTERNATIVE
WHERE THE LANGUAGES ARE KINDRED AND EQUALLY CAPABLE OF ALL VARIETIES OF
METRICAL EXPRESSION MAY NOT BOTH THESE MAXIMS BE OBSERVED IN THE SAME
TRANSLATION GOETHE IT IS TRUE WAS OF THE OPINION THAT FAUST OUGHT
TO BE GIVEN IN FRENCH IN THE MANNER OF CLEMENT MAROT BUT THIS WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY BECAUSE HE FELT THE INADEQUACY OF MODERN FRENCH TO EXPRESS
THE NAIVE SIMPLE REALISM OF MANY PASSAGES
THE SAME OBJECTION DOES NOT
APPLY TO ENGLISH
THERE ARE A FEW ARCHAIC EXPRESSIONS IN FAUST BUT NO
MORE THAN ARE STILL ALLOWED NAY FREQUENTLY ENCOURAGED IN THE ENGLISH
OF OUR DAY
B YOU ARE RIGHT SAID GOETHE THERE ARE GREAT AND MYSTERIOUS
AGENCIES INCLUDED IN THE VARIOUS FORMS OF POETRY
IF THE SUBSTANCE OF MY
'ROMAN ELEGIES' WERE TO BE EXPRESSED IN THE TONE AND MEASURE OF BYRON'S
'DON JUAN IT WOULD REALLY HAVE AN ATROCIOUS EFFECT ECKERMANN
THE RHYTHM SAID GOETHE IS AN UNCONSCIOUS RESULT OF THE POETIC MOOD
IF ONE SHOULD STOP TO CONSIDER IT MECHANICALLY WHEN ABOUT TO WRITE A
POEM ONE WOULD BECOME BEWILDERED AND ACCOMPLISH NOTHING OF REAL
POETICAL VALUE IBID
ALL THAT IS POETIC IN CHARACTER SHOULD BE RYTHMICALLY TREATED SUCH
IS MY CONVICTION AND IF EVEN A SORT OF POETIC PROSE SHOULD BE GRADUALLY
INTRODUCED IT WOULD ONLY SHOW THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PROSE AND
POETRY HAD BEEN COMPLETELY LOST SIGHT OF GOETHE TO SCHILLER 1797
TYCHO MOMMSEN IN HIS EXCELLENT ESSAY DIE KUNST DES DEUTSCHEN
UEBERSETZERS AUS NEUEREN SPRACHEN GOES SO FAR AS TO SAY THE METRICAL
OR RHYMED MODELLING OF A POETICAL WORK IS SO ESSENTIALLY THE GERM OF ITS
BEING THAT RATHER THAN BY GIVING IT UP WE MIGHT HOPE TO CONSTRUCT A
SIMILAR WORK OF ART BEFORE THE EYES OF OUR COUNTRYMEN BY GIVING UP OR
CHANGING THE SUBSTANCE
THE IMMEASURABLE RESULT WHICH HAS FOLLOWED WORKS
WHEREIN THE FORM HAS BEEN RETAINED SUCH AS THE HOMER OF VOSS AND THE
SHAKESPEARE OF TIECK AND SCHLEGEL IS AN INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE OF
THE VITALITY OF THE ENDEAVOR
C GOETHE'S POEMS EXERCISE A GREAT SWAY OVER ME NOT ONLY BY THEIR
MEANING BUT ALSO BY THEIR RHYTHM
IT IS A LANGUAGE WHICH STIMULATES ME
TO COMPOSITION BEETHOVEN
THE VARIOUS THEORIES OF TRANSLATION FROM THE GREEK AND LATIN POETS HAVE
BEEN ADMIRABLY STATED BY DRYDEN IN HIS PREFACE TO THE TRANSLATIONS FROM
OVID'S EPISTLES AND I DO NOT WISH TO CONTINUE THE ENDLESS
DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY AS OUR LITERATURE NEEDS EXAMPLES NOT OPINIONS
A RECENT EXPRESSION HOWEVER CARRIES WITH IT SO MUCH AUTHORITY THAT I
FEEL BOUND TO PRESENT SOME CONSIDERATIONS WHICH THE ACCOMPLISHED SCHOLAR
SEEMS TO HAVE OVERLOOKED
MR
LEWES D JUSTLY SAYS THE EFFECT OF
POETRY IS A COMPOUND OF MUSIC AND SUGGESTION THIS MUSIC AND THIS
SUGGESTION ARE INTERMINGLED IN WORDS WHICH TO ALTER IS TO ALTER THE
EFFECT
FOR WORDS IN POETRY ARE NOT AS IN PROSE SIMPLE REPRESENTATIVES
OF OBJECTS AND IDEAS THEY ARE PARTS OF AN ORGANIC WHOLE THEY ARE
TONES IN THE HARMONY HE THEREUPON ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT OF
TRANSLATION BY CHANGING CERTAIN WELL KNOWN ENGLISH STANZAS INTO OTHERS
EQUIVALENT IN MEANING BUT LACKING THEIR FELICITY OF WORDS THEIR GRACE
AND MELODY
I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS ILLUSTRATION AS VALID BECAUSE MR
LEWES PURPOSELY OMITS THE VERY QUALITY WHICH AN HONEST TRANSLATOR SHOULD
EXHAUST HIS SKILL IN ENDEAVORING TO REPRODUCE
HE TURNS AWAY FROM THE
ONE BEST WORD OR PHRASE IN THE ENGLISH LINES HE QUOTES WHEREAS THE
TRANSLATOR SEEKS PRECISELY THAT ONE BEST WORD OR PHRASE HAVING ALL
THE RESOURCES OF HIS LANGUAGE AT COMMAND TO REPRESENT WHAT IS SAID IN
ANOTHER LANGUAGE
MORE THAN THIS HIS TASK IS NOT SIMPLY MECHANICAL
HE MUST FEEL AND BE GUIDED BY A SECONDARY INSPIRATION
SURRENDERING
HIMSELF TO THE FULL POSSESSION OF THE SPIRIT WHICH SHALL SPEAK THROUGH
HIM HE RECEIVES ALSO A PORTION OF THE SAME CREATIVE POWER
MR
LEWES
REACHES THIS CONCLUSION IF THEREFORE WE REFLECT WHAT A POEM FAUST
IS AND THAT IT CONTAINS ALMOST EVERY VARIETY OF STYLE AND METRE IT
WILL BE TOLERABLY EVIDENT THAT NO ONE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE ORIGINAL CAN
FORM AN ADEQUATE IDEA OF IT FROM TRANSLATION E WHICH IS CERTAINLY
CORRECT OF ANY TRANSLATION WHEREIN SOMETHING OF THE RHYTHMICAL VARIETY
AND BEAUTY OF THE ORIGINAL IS NOT RETAINED
THAT VERY MUCH OF THE
RHYTHMICAL CHARACTER MAY BE RETAINED IN ENGLISH WAS LONG AGO SHOWN BY
MR
CARLYLE F IN THE PASSAGES WHICH HE TRANSLATED BOTH LITERALLY AND
RHYTHMICALLY FROM THE HELENA PART SECOND
IN FACT WE HAVE SO MANY
INSTANCES OF THE POSSIBILITY OF RECIPROCALLY TRANSFERRING THE FINEST
QUALITIES OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN POETRY THAT THERE IS NO SUFFICIENT
EXCUSE FOR AN UNMETRICAL TRANSLATION OF FAUST
I REFER ESPECIALLY TO
SUCH SUBTILE AND MELODIOUS LYRICS AS THE CASTLE BY THE SEA OF UHLAND
AND THE SILENT LAND OF SALIS TRANSLATED BY MR
LONGFELLOW GOETHE'S
MINSTREL AND COPTIC SONG BY DR
HEDGE HEINE'S TWO GRENADIERS BY
DR
FURNESS AND MANY OF HEINE'S SONGS BY MR LELAND AND ALSO TO THE
GERMAN TRANSLATIONS OF ENGLISH LYRICS BY FREILIGRATH AND STRODTMANN G
D LIFE OF GOETHE BOOK VI
E MR
LEWES GIVES THE FOLLOWING ADVICE THE ENGLISH READER WOULD
PERHAPS BEST SUCCEED WHO SHOULD FIRST READ DR
ANSTER'S BRILLIANT
PARAPHRASE AND THEN CAREFULLY GO THROUGH HAYWARD'S PROSE TRANSLATION
THIS IS SINGULARLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE VIEW HE HAS JUST EXPRESSED
DR
ANSTER'S VERSION IS AN ALMOST INCREDIBLE DILUTION OF THE ORIGINAL
WRITTEN IN OTHER METRES WHILE HAYWARD'S ENTIRELY OMITS THE ELEMENT OF
POETRY

IT MUST BE A DULL EAR WHICH WOULD BE SATISFIED WITH THE OMISSION OF

I HAVE A MORE SERIOUS OBJECTION HOWEVER TO URGE AGAINST MR
HAYWARD'S
PROSE TRANSLATION
WHERE ALL THE RESTRAINTS OF VERSE ARE FLUNG ASIDE WE
SHOULD EXPECT AT LEAST AS ACCURATE A REPRODUCTION OF THE SENSE
SPIRIT AND TONE OF THE ORIGINAL AS THE GENIUS OF OUR LANGUAGE WILL
PERMIT
SO FAR FROM HAVING GIVEN US SUCH A REPRODUCTION MR
HAYWARD NOT
ONLY OCCASIONALLY MISTAKES THE EXACT MEANING OF THE GERMAN TEXT H BUT
WHEREVER TWO PHRASES MAY BE USED TO EXPRESS THE MEANING WITH EQUAL
FIDELITY HE VERY FREQUENTLY SELECTS THAT WHICH HAS THE LESS GRACE

SCENE II IS
KHN IS DAS MHEN
HERRLICH DER LOHN

ZIEHEN DAVON
LITERALLY
BOLD IS THE ENDEAVOR
SPLENDID THE PAY
AND THE SOLDIERS
MARCH AWAY
THIS MR
HAYWARD TRANSLATES
BOLD THE ADVENTURE
NOBLE THE REWARD
AND THE SOLDIERS
ARE OFF
FOR THERE ARE FEW THINGS WHICH MAY NOT BE SAID IN ENGLISH IN A TWOFOLD
MANNER ONE POETIC AND THE OTHER PROSAIC
IN GERMAN EQUALLY A WORD
WHICH IN ORDINARY USE HAS A BARE PROSAIC CHARACTER MAY RECEIVE A FAIRER
AND FINER QUALITY FROM ITS PLACE IN VERSE
THE PROSE TRANSLATOR SHOULD
CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO FEEL THE MANIFESTATION OF THIS LAW IN BOTH
LANGUAGES AND SHOULD SO CHOOSE HIS WORDS AS TO MEET THEIR RECIPROCAL
REQUIREMENTS
A MAN HOWEVER WHO IS NOT KEENLY SENSIBLE TO THE POWER
AND BEAUTY AND VALUE OF RHYTHM IS LIKELY TO OVERLOOK THESE DELICATE YET
MOST NECESSARY DISTINCTIONS
THE AUTHOR'S THOUGHT IS STRIPPED OF A LAST
GRACE IN PASSING THROUGH HIS MIND AND FREQUENTLY PRESENTS VERY MUCH THE
SAME RESEMBLANCE TO THE ORIGINAL AS AN UNHEWN SHAFT TO THE FLUTED
COLUMN
MR
HAYWARD UNCONSCIOUSLY ILLUSTRATES HIS LACK OF A REFINED
APPRECIATION OF VERSE IN GIVING AS HE SAYS A SORT OF RHYTHMICAL
ARRANGEMENT TO THE LYRICAL PARTS HIS OBJECT BEING TO CONVEY SOME
NOTION OF THE VARIETY OF VERSIFICATION WHICH FORMS ONE GREAT CHARM OF
THE POEM A LITERAL TRANSLATION IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE IN THE UNRHYMED
PASSAGES BUT EVEN HERE MR
HAYWARD'S EAR DID NOT DICTATE TO HIM THE
NECESSITY OF PRESERVING THE ORIGINAL RHYTHM
WHILE THEREFORE I HEARTILY RECOGNIZE HIS LOFTY APPRECIATION OF
FAUST WHILE I HONOR HIM FOR THE PATIENT AND CONSCIENTIOUS LABOR HE
HAS BESTOWED UPON HIS TRANSLATION I CANNOT BUT FEEL THAT HE HAS
HIMSELF ILLUSTRATED THE UNSOUNDNESS OF HIS ARGUMENT
NEVERTHELESS THE
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HIS PROSE TRANSLATION OF FAUST HAS RECEIVED SO MUCH
ACCEPTANCE PROVES THOSE QUALITIES OF THE ORIGINAL WORK WHICH CANNOT BE
DESTROYED BY A TEST SO VIOLENT
FROM THE COLD BARE OUTLINE THUS
PRODUCED THE READER UNACQUAINTED WITH THE GERMAN LANGUAGE WOULD
SCARCELY GUESS WHAT GLOW OF COLOR WHAT RICHNESS OF CHANGEFUL LIFE WHAT
FLUENT GRACE AND ENERGY OF MOVEMENT HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE PROCESS
WE
MUST OF COURSE GRATEFULLY RECEIVE SUCH AN OUTLINE WHERE A NEARER
APPROACH TO THE FORM OF THE ORIGINAL IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT UNTIL THE
LATTER HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WE ARE WRONG TO REMAIN CONTENT WITH THE
CHEAPER SUBSTITUTE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN ALL DISCUSSIONS UPON THIS SUBJECT THE CAPACITIES
OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAVE RECEIVED BUT SCANTY JUSTICE
THE
INTELLECTUAL TENDENCIES OF OUR RACE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SOMEWHAT
CONSERVATIVE AND ITS STANDARDS OF LITERARY TASTE OR BELIEF ONCE SET
UP ARE NOT VARIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
THE ENGLISH EAR IS SUSPICIOUS OF
NEW METRES AND UNACCUSTOMED FORMS OF EXPRESSION THERE ARE CRITICAL
DETECTIVES ON THE TRACK OF EVERY AUTHOR AND A VIOLATION OF THE ACCEPTED
CANONS IS FOLLOWED BY A SUMMONS TO JUDGMENT
THUS THE TENDENCY IS TO
CONTRACT RATHER THAN TO EXPAND THE ACKNOWLEDGED EXCELLENCES OF THE
LANGUAGE J
J I CANNOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF QUOTING THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE FROM
JACOB GRIMM NO ONE OF ALL THE MODERN LANGUAGES HAS ACQUIRED A GREATER
FORCE AND STRENGTH THAN THE ENGLISH THROUGH THE DERANGEMENT AND
RELINQUISHMENT OF ITS ANCIENT LAWS OF SOUND
THE UNTEACHABLE
NEVERTHELESS LEARNABLE PROFUSION OF ITS MIDDLE TONES HAS CONFERRED
UPON IT AN INTRINSIC POWER OF EXPRESSION SUCH AS NO OTHER HUMAN TONGUE
EVER POSSESSED
ITS ENTIRE THOROUGHLY INTELLECTUAL AND WONDERFULLY
SUCCESSFUL FOUNDATION AND PERFECTED DEVELOPMENT ISSUED FROM A MARVELOUS
UNION OF THE TWO NOBLEST TONGUES OF EUROPE THE GERMANIC AND THE
ROMANIC
THEIR MUTUAL RELATION IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS WELL KNOWN
SINCE THE FORMER FURNISHED CHIEFLY THE MATERIAL BASIS WHILE THE LATTER
ADDED THE INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTIONS
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BY AND THROUGH
WHICH THE GREATEST AND MOST EMINENT POET OF MODERN TIMES AS CONTRASTED
WITH ANCIENT CLASSICAL POETRY OF COURSE I CAN REFER ONLY TO
SHAKESPEARE WAS BEGOTTEN AND NOURISHED HAS A JUST CLAIM TO BE CALLED A
LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD AND IT APPEARS TO BE DESTINED LIKE THE ENGLISH
RACE TO A HIGHER AND BROADER SWAY IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE EARTH
FOR IN
RICHNESS IN COMPACT ADJUSTMENT OF PARTS AND IN PURE INTELLIGENCE NONE
OF THE LIVING LANGUAGES CAN BE COMPARED WITH IT NOT EVEN OUR GERMAN
WHICH IS DIVIDED EVEN AS WE ARE DIVIDED AND WHICH MUST CAST OFF MANY
IMPERFECTIONS BEFORE IT CAN BOLDLY ENTER ON ITS CAREER UEBER DEN
URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE
THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF A NEARLY LITERAL TRANSLATION OF FAUST
IN THE ORIGINAL METRES HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATED BECAUSE CERTAIN AFFINITIES
BETWEEN THE TWO LANGUAGES HAVE NOT BEEN PROPERLY CONSIDERED
WITH ALL
THE SPLENDOR OF VERSIFICATION IN THE WORK IT CONTAINS BUT FEW METRES OF
WHICH THE ENGLISH TONGUE IS NOT EQUALLY CAPABLE
HOOD HAS FAMILIARIZED
US WITH DACTYLIC TRIPLE RHYMES AND THEY ARE REMARKABLY ABUNDANT AND
SKILLFUL IN MR
LOWELL'S FABLE FOR THE CRITICS EVEN THE UNRHYMED
IAMBIC HEXAMETER OF THE HELENA OCCURS NOW AND THEN IN MILTON'S SAMSON
AGONISTES
IT IS TRUE THAT THE METRICAL FOOT INTO WHICH THE GERMAN
LANGUAGE MOST NATURALLY FALLS IS THE TROCHAIC WHILE IN ENGLISH IT IS
THE IAMBIC IT IS TRUE THAT GERMAN IS RICH INVOLVED AND TOLERANT OF
NEW COMBINATIONS WHILE ENGLISH IS SIMPLE DIRECT AND RATHER SHY OF
COMPOUNDS BUT PRECISELY THESE DIFFERENCES ARE SO MODIFIED IN THE GERMAN
OF FAUST THAT THERE IS A MUTUAL APPROACH OF THE TWO LANGUAGES
IN
FAUST THE IAMBIC MEASURE PREDOMINATES THE STYLE IS COMPACT THE MANY
LICENSES WHICH THE AUTHOR ALLOWS HIMSELF ARE ALL DIRECTED TOWARDS A
SHORTER MODE OF CONSTRUCTION
ON THE OTHER HAND ENGLISH METRE COMPELS
THE USE OF INVERSIONS ADMITS MANY VERBAL LIBERTIES PROHIBITED TO PROSE
AND SO INCLINES TOWARDS VARIOUS FLEXIBLE FEATURES OF ITS SISTER TONGUE
THAT MANY LINES OF FAUST MAY BE REPEATED IN ENGLISH WITHOUT THE
SLIGHTEST CHANGE OF MEANING MEASURE OR RHYME
THERE ARE WORDS IT IS
TRUE WITH SO DELICATE A BLOOM UPON THEM THAT IT CAN IN NO WISE BE
PRESERVED BUT EVEN SUCH WORDS WILL ALWAYS LOSE LESS WHEN THEY CARRY
WITH THEM THEIR RHYTHMICAL ATMOSPHERE
THE FLOW OF GOETHE'S VERSE IS
SOMETIMES SO SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE CORRESPONDING ENGLISH METRE THAT
NOT ONLY ITS HARMONIES AND CAESURAL PAUSES BUT EVEN ITS PUNCTUATION
MAY BE EASILY RETAINED
I AM SATISFIED THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TRANSLATION OF FAUST IN
PROSE OR METRE IS CHIEFLY ONE OF LABOR AND OF THAT LABOR WHICH IS
SUCCESSFUL IN PROPORTION AS IT IS JOYOUSLY PERFORMED
MY OWN TASK HAS
BEEN CHEERED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT THE MORE CLOSELY I REPRODUCED THE
LANGUAGE OF THE ORIGINAL THE MORE OF ITS RHYTHMICAL CHARACTER WAS
TRANSFERRED AT THE SAME TIME
IF NOW AND THEN THERE WAS AN INEVITABLE
ALTERNATIVE OF MEANING OR MUSIC I GAVE THE PREFERENCE TO THE FORMER
BY
THE TERM ORIGINAL METRES I DO NOT MEAN A RIGID UNYIELDING ADHERENCE
TO EVERY FOOT LINE AND RHYME OF THE GERMAN ORIGINAL ALTHOUGH THIS HAS
VERY NEARLY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED
SINCE THE GREATER PART OF THE WORK IS
WRITTEN IN AN IRREGULAR MEASURE THE LINES VARYING FROM THREE TO SIX
FEET AND THE RHYMES ARRANGED ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR'S WILL I DO NOT
CONSIDER THAT AN OCCASIONAL CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF FEET OR ORDER OF
RHYME IS ANY VIOLATION OF THE METRICAL PLAN
THE SINGLE SLIGHT LIBERTY
I HAVE TAKEN WITH THE LYRICAL PASSAGES IS IN MARGARET'S SONG THE KING
OF THULE IN WHICH BY OMITTING THE ALTERNATE FEMININE RHYMES YET
RETAINING THE METRE I WAS ENABLED TO MAKE THE TRANSLATION STRICTLY
LITERAL
IF IN TWO OR THREE INSTANCES I HAVE LEFT A LINE UNRHYMED I
HAVE BALANCED THE OMISSION BY GIVING RHYMES TO OTHER LINES WHICH STAND
UNRHYMED IN THE ORIGINAL TEXT
FOR THE SAME REASON I MAKE NO APOLOGY
FOR THE IMPERFECT RHYMES WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY A TRANSLATION AS WELL AS
A NECESSITY
WITH ALL ITS SUPREME QUALITIES FAUST IS FAR FROM BEING A
TECHNICALLY PERFECT WORK K
K AT PRESENT EVERYTHING RUNS IN TECHNICAL GROOVES AND THE CRITICAL
GENTLEMEN BEGIN TO WRANGLE WHETHER IN A RHYME AN S SHOULD CORRESPOND
WITH AN S AND NOT WITH SZ
IF I WERE YOUNG AND RECKLESS ENOUGH I
WOULD PURPOSELY OFFEND ALL SUCH TECHNICAL CAPRICES I WOULD USE
ALLITERATION ASSONANCE FALSE RHYME JUST ACCORDING TO MY OWN WILL OR
CONVENIENCE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD ATTEND TO THE MAIN THING
AND ENDEAVOR TO SAY SO MANY GOOD THINGS THAT EVERY ONE WOULD BE
ATTRACTED TO READ AND REMEMBER THEM GOETHE IN 1831
THE FEMININE AND DACTYLIC RHYMES WHICH HAVE BEEN FOR THE MOST PART
OMITTED BY ALL METRICAL TRANSLATORS EXCEPT MR
BROOKS ARE
INDISPENSABLE
THE CHARACTERISTIC TONE OF MANY PASSAGES WOULD BE NEARLY
LOST WITHOUT THEM
THEY GIVE SPIRIT AND GRACE TO THE DIALOGUE POINT TO
THE APHORISTIC PORTIONS ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND PART AND AN
EVER CHANGING MUSIC TO THE LYRICAL PASSAGES
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
THOUGH NOT SO RICH AS THE GERMAN IN SUCH RHYMES IS LESS DEFICIENT THAN
IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED
THE DIFFICULTY TO BE OVERCOME IS ONE OF
CONSTRUCTION RATHER THAN OF THE VOCABULARY
THE PRESENT PARTICIPLE CAN
ONLY BE USED TO A LIMITED EXTENT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS WEAK TERMINATION
AND THE WANT OF AN ACCUSATIVE FORM TO THE NOUN ALSO RESTRICTS THE
ARRANGEMENT OF WORDS IN ENGLISH VERSE
I CANNOT HOPE TO HAVE BEEN ALWAYS
SUCCESSFUL BUT I HAVE AT LEAST LABORED LONG AND PATIENTLY BEARING
CONSTANTLY IN MIND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF THE ORIGINAL AND THE
MECHANICAL STRUCTURE OF THE LINES BUT ALSO THAT SUBTILE AND HAUNTING
MUSIC WHICH SEEMS TO GOVERN RHYTHM INSTEAD OF BEING GOVERNED BY IT

MANAGER DRAMATIC POET MERRY ANDREW
MANAGER
YOU TWO WHO OFT A HELPING HAND
HAVE LENT IN NEED AND TRIBULATION
COME LET ME KNOW YOUR EXPECTATION
OF THIS OUR ENTERPRISE IN GERMAN LAND
I WISH THE CROWD TO FEEL ITSELF WELL TREATED
ESPECIALLY SINCE IT LIVES AND LETS ME LIVE
THE POSTS ARE SET THE BOOTH OF BOARDS COMPLETED
AND EACH AWAITS THE BANQUET I SHALL GIVE
ALREADY THERE WITH CURIOUS EYEBROWS RAISED
THEY SIT SEDATE AND HOPE TO BE AMAZED
I KNOW HOW ONE THE PEOPLE'S TASTE MAY FLATTER
YET HERE A HUGE EMBARRASSMENT I FEEL
WHAT THEY'RE ACCUSTOMED TO IS NO GREAT MATTER
BUT THEN ALAS THEY'VE READ AN AWFUL DEAL
HOW SHALL WE PLAN THAT ALL BE FRESH AND NEW
IMPORTANT MATTER YET ATTRACTIVE TOO
FOR 'TIS MY PLEASURE TO BEHOLD THEM SURGING
WHEN TO OUR BOOTH THE CURRENT SETS APACE
AND WITH TREMENDOUS OFT REPEATED URGING
SQUEEZE ONWARD THROUGH THE NARROW GATE OF GRACE
BY DAYLIGHT EVEN THEY PUSH AND CRAM IN
TO REACH THE SELLER'S BOX A FIGHTING HOST
AND AS FOR BREAD AROUND A BAKER'S DOOR IN FAMINE
TO GET A TICKET BREAK THEIR NECKS ALMOST
THIS MIRACLE ALONE CAN WORK THE POET
ON MEN SO VARIOUS NOW MY FRIEND PRAY SHOW IT
POET
SPEAK NOT TO ME OF YONDER MOTLEY MASSES
WHOM BUT TO SEE PUTS OUT THE FIRE OF SONG
HIDE FROM MY VIEW THE SURGING CROWD THAT PASSES
AND IN ITS WHIRLPOOL FORCES US ALONG
NO LEAD ME WHERE SOME HEAVENLY SILENCE GLASSES
THE PURER JOYS THAT ROUND THE POET THRONG
WHERE LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP STILL DIVINELY FASHION
THE BONDS THAT BLESS THE WREATHS THAT CROWN HIS PASSION
AH EVERY UTTERANCE FROM THE DEPTHS OF FEELING
THE TIMID LIPS HAVE STAMMERINGLY EXPRESSED
NOW FAILING NOW PERCHANCE SUCCESS REVEALING
GULPS THE WILD MOMENT IN ITS GREEDY BREAST
OR OFT RELUCTANT YEARS ITS WARRANT SEALING
ITS PERFECT STATURE STANDS AT LAST CONFESSED
WHAT DAZZLES FOR THE MOMENT SPENDS ITS SPIRIT
WHAT'S GENUINE SHALL POSTERITY INHERIT
MERRY ANDREW
POSTERITY DON'T NAME THE WORD TO ME
IF I SHOULD CHOOSE TO PREACH POSTERITY
WHERE WOULD YOU GET CONTEMPORARY FUN
THAT MEN WILL HAVE IT THERE'S NO BLINKING
A FINE YOUNG FELLOW'S PRESENCE TO MY THINKING
IS SOMETHING WORTH TO EVERY ONE
WHO GENIALLY HIS NATURE CAN OUTPOUR
TAKES FROM THE PEOPLE'S MOODS NO IRRITATION
THE WIDER CIRCLE HE ACQUIRES THE MORE
SECURELY WORKS HIS INSPIRATION
THEN PLUCK UP HEART AND GIVE US STERLING COIN
LET FANCY BE WITH HER ATTENDANTS FITTED
SENSE REASON SENTIMENT AND PASSION JOIN
BUT HAVE A CARE LEST FOLLY BE OMITTED
MANAGER
CHIEFLY ENOUGH OF INCIDENT PREPARE
THEY COME TO LOOK AND THEY PREFER TO STARE
REEL OFF A HOST OF THREADS BEFORE THEIR FACES
SO THAT THEY GAPE IN STUPID WONDER THEN
BY SHEER DIFFUSENESS YOU HAVE WON THEIR GRACES
AND ARE AT ONCE MOST POPULAR OF MEN
ONLY BY MASS YOU TOUCH THE MASS FOR ANY
WILL FINALLY HIMSELF HIS BIT SELECT
WHO OFFERS MUCH BRINGS SOMETHING UNTO MANY
AND EACH GOES HOME CONTENT WITH THE EFFECT
IF YOU'VE A PIECE WHY JUST IN PIECES GIVE IT
A HASH A STEW WILL BRING SUCCESS BELIEVE IT
'TIS EASILY DISPLAYED AND EASY TO INVENT
WHAT USE A WHOLE COMPACTLY TO PRESENT
YOUR HEARERS PICK AND PLUCK AS SOON AS THEY RECEIVE IT

SUCH A REPROACH NOT IN THE LEAST OFFENDS
A MAN WHO SOME RESULT INTENDS
MUST USE THE TOOLS THAT BEST ARE FITTING
REFLECT SOFT WOOD IS GIVEN TO YOU FOR SPLITTING
AND THEN OBSERVE FOR WHOM YOU WRITE
IF ONE COMES BORED EXHAUSTED QUITE
ANOTHER SATIATE LEAVES THE BANQUET'S TAPERS
AND WORST OF ALL FULL MANY A WIGHT
IS FRESH FROM READING OF THE DAILY PAPERS
IDLY TO US THEY COME AS TO A MASQUERADE
MERE CURIOSITY THEIR SPIRITS WARMING
THE LADIES WITH THEMSELVES AND WITH THEIR FINERY AID
WITHOUT A SALARY THEIR PARTS PERFORMING
WHAT DREAMS ARE YOURS IN HIGH POETIC PLACES
YOU'RE PLEASED FORSOOTH FULL HOUSES TO BEHOLD
DRAW NEAR AND VIEW YOUR PATRONS' FACES
THE HALF ARE COARSE THE HALF ARE COLD
ONE WHEN THE PLAY IS OUT GOES HOME TO CARDS
A WILD NIGHT ON A WENCH'S BREAST ANOTHER CHOOSES
WHY SHOULD YOU RACK POOR FOOLISH BARDS
FOR ENDS LIKE THESE THE GRACIOUS MUSES
I TELL YOU GIVE BUT MORE MORE EVER MORE THEY ASK
THUS SHALL YOU HIT THE MARK OF GAIN AND GLORY
SEEK TO CONFOUND YOUR AUDITORY
TO SATISFY THEM IS A TASK
WHAT AILS YOU NOW IS'T SUFFERING OR PLEASURE
POET
GO FIND YOURSELF A MORE OBEDIENT SLAVE
WHAT SHALL THE POET THAT WHICH NATURE GAVE
THE HIGHEST RIGHT SUPREME HUMANITY
FORFEIT SO WANTONLY TO SWELL YOUR TREASURE
WHENCE O'ER THE HEART HIS EMPIRE FREE
THE ELEMENTS OF LIFE HOW CONQUERS HE
IS'T NOT HIS HEART'S ACCORD URGED OUTWARD FAR AND DIM
TO WIND THE WORLD IN UNISON WITH HIM
WHEN ON THE SPINDLE SPUN TO ENDLESS DISTANCE
BY NATURE'S LISTLESS HAND THE THREAD IS TWIRLED
AND THE DISCORDANT TONES OF ALL EXISTENCE
IN SULLEN JANGLE ARE TOGETHER HURLED
WHO THEN THE CHANGELESS ORDERS OF CREATION
DIVIDES AND KINDLES INTO RHYTHMIC DANCE
WHO BRINGS THE ONE TO JOIN THE GENERAL ORDINATION
WHERE IT MAY THROB IN GRANDEST CONSONANCE
WHO BIDS THE STORM TO PASSION STIR THE BOSOM
IN BROODING SOULS THE SUNSET BURN ABOVE
WHO SCATTERS EVERY FAIREST APRIL BLOSSOM
ALONG THE SHINING PATH OF LOVE
WHO BRAIDS THE NOTELESS LEAVES TO CROWNS REQUITING
DESERT WITH FAME IN ACTION'S EVERY FIELD
WHO MAKES OLYMPUS SURE THE GODS UNITING
THE MIGHT OF MAN AS IN THE BARD REVEALED
MERRY ANDREW
SO THESE FINE FORCES IN CONJUNCTION
PROPEL THE HIGH POETIC FUNCTION
AS IN A LOVE ADVENTURE THEY MIGHT PLAY
YOU MEET BY ACCIDENT YOU FEEL YOU STAY
AND BY DEGREES YOUR HEART IS TANGLED
BLISS GROWS APACE AND THEN ITS COURSE IS JANGLED
YOU'RE RAVISHED QUITE THEN COMES A TOUCH OF WOE
AND THERE'S A NEAT ROMANCE COMPLETED ERE YOU KNOW
LET US THEN SUCH A DRAMA GIVE
GRASP THE EXHAUSTLESS LIFE THAT ALL MEN LIVE
EACH SHARES THEREIN THOUGH FEW MAY COMPREHEND
WHERE'ER YOU TOUCH THERE'S INTEREST WITHOUT END
IN MOTLEY PICTURES LITTLE LIGHT
MUCH ERROR AND OF TRUTH A GLIMMERING MITE
THUS THE BEST BEVERAGE IS SUPPLIED
WHENCE ALL THE WORLD IS CHEERED AND EDIFIED
THEN AT YOUR PLAY BEHOLD THE FAIREST FLOWER
OF YOUTH COLLECT TO HEAR THE REVELATION
EACH TENDER SOUL WITH SENTIMENTAL POWER
SUCKS MELANCHOLY FOOD FROM YOUR CREATION
AND NOW IN THIS NOW THAT THE LEAVEN WORKS
FOR EACH BEHOLDS WHAT IN HIS BOSOM LURKS
THEY STILL ARE MOVED AT ONCE TO WEEPING OR TO LAUGHTER
STILL WONDER AT YOUR FLIGHTS ENJOY THE SHOW THEY SEE
A MIND ONCE FORMED IS NEVER SUITED AFTER
ONE YET IN GROWTH WILL EVER GRATEFUL BE
POET
THEN GIVE ME BACK THAT TIME OF PLEASURES
WHILE YET IN JOYOUS GROWTH I SANG
WHEN LIKE A FOUNT THE CROWDING MEASURES
UNINTERRUPTED GUSHED AND SPRANG
THEN BRIGHT MIST VEILED THE WORLD BEFORE ME
IN OPENING BUDS A MARVEL WOKE
AS I THE THOUSAND BLOSSOMS BROKE
WHICH EVERY VALLEY RICHLY BORE ME
I NOTHING HAD AND YET ENOUGH FOR YOUTH
JOY IN ILLUSION ARDENT THIRST FOR TRUTH
GIVE UNRESTRAINED THE OLD EMOTION
THE BLISS THAT TOUCHED THE VERGE OF PAIN
THE STRENGTH OF HATE LOVE'S DEEP DEVOTION
O GIVE ME BACK MY YOUTH AGAIN
MERRY ANDREW
YOUTH GOOD MY FRIEND YOU CERTAINLY REQUIRE
WHEN FOES IN COMBAT SORELY PRESS YOU
WHEN LOVELY MAIDS IN FOND DESIRE
HANG ON YOUR BOSOM AND CARESS YOU
WHEN FROM THE HARD WON GOAL THE WREATH
BECKONS AFAR THE RACE AWAITING
WHEN AFTER DANCING OUT YOUR BREATH
YOU PASS THE NIGHT IN DISSIPATING
BUT THAT FAMILIAR HARP WITH SOUL
TO PLAY WITH GRACE AND BOLD EXPRESSION
AND TOWARDS A SELF ERECTED GOAL
TO WALK WITH MANY A SWEET DIGRESSION
THIS AGED SIRS BELONGS TO YOU
AND WE NO LESS REVERE YOU FOR THAT REASON
AGE CHILDISH MAKES THEY SAY BUT 'TIS NOT TRUE
WE'RE ONLY GENUINE CHILDREN STILL IN AGE'S SEASON
MANAGER
THE WORDS YOU'VE BANDIED ARE SUFFICIENT
'TIS DEEDS THAT I PREFER TO SEE
IN COMPLIMENTS YOU'RE BOTH PROFICIENT
BUT MIGHT THE WHILE MORE USEFUL BE
WHAT NEED TO TALK OF INSPIRATION
'TIS NO COMPANION OF DELAY
IF POETRY BE YOUR VOCATION
LET POETRY YOUR WILL OBEY
FULL WELL YOU KNOW WHAT HERE IS WANTING
THE CROWD FOR STRONGEST DRINK IS PANTING
AND SUCH FORTHWITH I'D HAVE YOU BREW
WHAT'S LEFT UNDONE TO DAY TO MORROW WILL NOT DO
WASTE NOT A DAY IN VAIN DIGRESSION
WITH RESOLUTE COURAGEOUS TRUST
SEIZE EVERY POSSIBLE IMPRESSION
AND MAKE IT FIRMLY YOUR POSSESSION
YOU'LL THEN WORK ON BECAUSE YOU MUST
UPON OUR GERMAN STAGE YOU KNOW IT
EACH TRIES HIS HAND AT WHAT HE WILL
SO TAKE OF TRAPS AND SCENES YOUR FILL
AND ALL YOU FIND BE SURE TO SHOW IT
USE BOTH THE GREAT AND LESSER HEAVENLY LIGHT
SQUANDER THE STARS IN ANY NUMBER
BEASTS BIRDS TREES ROCKS AND ALL SUCH LUMBER
FIRE WATER DARKNESS DAY AND NIGHT
THUS IN OUR BOOTH'S CONTRACTED SPHERE
THE CIRCLE OF CREATION WILL APPEAR
AND MOVE AS WE DELIBERATELY IMPEL
FROM HEAVEN ACROSS THE WORLD TO HELL

PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN
THE LORD THE HEAVENLY HOST AFTERWARDS
MEPHISTOPHELES
THE THREE ARCHANGELS COME FORWARD
RAPHAEL
THE SUN ORB SINGS IN EMULATION
'MID BROTHER SPHERES HIS ANCIENT ROUND
HIS PATH PREDESTINED THROUGH CREATION
HE ENDS WITH STEP OF THUNDER SOUND
THE ANGELS FROM HIS VISAGE SPLENDID
DRAW POWER WHOSE MEASURE NONE CAN SAY
THE LOFTY WORKS UNCOMPREHENDED
ARE BRIGHT AS ON THE EARLIEST DAY
GABRIEL
AND SWIFT AND SWIFT BEYOND CONCEIVING
THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORLD GOES ROUND
DAY'S EDEN BRIGHTNESS STILL RELIEVING
THE AWFUL NIGHT'S INTENSE PROFOUND
THE OCEAN TIDES IN FOAM ARE BREAKING
AGAINST THE ROCKS' DEEP BASES HURLED
AND BOTH THE SPHERIC RACE PARTAKING
ETERNAL SWIFT ARE ONWARD WHIRLED
MICHAEL
AND RIVAL STORMS ABROAD ARE SURGING
FROM SEA TO LAND FROM LAND TO SEA
A CHAIN OF DEEPEST ACTION FORGING
ROUND ALL IN WRATHFUL ENERGY
THERE FLAMES A DESOLATION BLAZING
BEFORE THE THUNDER'S CRASHING WAY
YET LORD THY MESSENGERS ARE PRAISING
THE GENTLE MOVEMENT OF THY DAY
THE THREE
THOUGH STILL BY THEM UNCOMPREHENDED
FROM THESE THE ANGELS DRAW THEIR POWER
AND ALL THY WORKS SUBLIME AND SPLENDID
ARE BRIGHT AS IN CREATION'S HOUR
MEPHISTOPHELES
SINCE THOU O LORD DEIGN'ST TO APPROACH AGAIN
AND ASK US HOW WE DO IN MANNER KINDEST
AND HERETOFORE TO MEET MYSELF WERT FAIN
AMONG THY MENIALS NOW MY FACE THOU FINDEST
PARDON THIS TROOP I CANNOT FOLLOW AFTER
WITH LOFTY SPEECH THOUGH BY THEM SCORNED AND SPURNED
MY PATHOS CERTAINLY WOULD MOVE THY LAUGHTER
IF THOU HADST NOT ALL MERRIMENT UNLEARNED
OF SUNS AND WORLDS I'VE NOTHING TO BE QUOTED
HOW MEN TORMENT THEMSELVES IS ALL I'VE NOTED
THE LITTLE GOD O' THE WORLD STICKS TO THE SAME OLD WAY
AND IS AS WHIMSICAL AS ON CREATION'S DAY
LIFE SOMEWHAT BETTER MIGHT CONTENT HIM
BUT FOR THE GLEAM OF HEAVENLY LIGHT WHICH THOU HAST LENT
HIM
HE CALLS IT REASON THENCE HIS POWER'S INCREASED
TO BE FAR BEASTLIER THAN ANY BEAST
SAVING THY GRACIOUS PRESENCE HE TO ME
A LONG LEGGED GRASSHOPPER APPEARS TO BE
THAT SPRINGING FLIES AND FLYING SPRINGS
AND IN THE GRASS THE SAME OLD DITTY SINGS
WOULD HE STILL LAY AMONG THE GRASS HE GROWS IN
EACH BIT OF DUNG HE SEEKS TO STICK HIS NOSE IN
THE LORD
HAST THOU THEN NOTHING MORE TO MENTION
COM'ST EVER THUS WITH ILL INTENTION
FIND'ST NOTHING RIGHT ON EARTH ETERNALLY
MEPHISTOPHELES
NO LORD I FIND THINGS THERE STILL BAD AS THEY CAN BE
MAN'S MISERY EVEN TO PITY MOVES MY NATURE
I'VE SCARCE THE HEART TO PLAGUE THE WRETCHED CREATURE
THE LORD
KNOW'ST FAUST
MEPHISTOPHELES
THE DOCTOR FAUST
THE LORD
MY SERVANT HE
MEPHISTOPHELES
FORSOOTH HE SERVES YOU AFTER STRANGE DEVICES
NO EARTHLY MEAT OR DRINK THE FOOL SUFFICES
HIS SPIRIT'S FERMENT FAR ASPIRETH
HALF CONSCIOUS OF HIS FRENZIED CRAZED UNREST
THE FAIREST STARS FROM HEAVEN HE REQUIRETH
FROM EARTH THE HIGHEST RAPTURES AND THE BEST
AND ALL THE NEAR AND FAR THAT HE DESIRETH
FAILS TO SUBDUE THE TUMULT OF HIS BREAST
THE LORD
THOUGH STILL CONFUSED HIS SERVICE UNTO ME
I SOON SHALL LEAD HIM TO A CLEARER MORNING
SEES NOT THE GARDENER EVEN WHILE BUDS HIS TREE
BOTH FLOWER AND FRUIT THE FUTURE YEARS ADORNING
MEPHISTOPHELES
WHAT WILL YOU BET THERE'S STILL A CHANCE TO GAIN HIM
IF UNTO ME FULL LEAVE YOU GIVE
GENTLY UPON MY ROAD TO TRAIN HIM
THE LORD
AS LONG AS HE ON EARTH SHALL LIVE
SO LONG I MAKE NO PROHIBITION
WHILE MAN'S DESIRES AND ASPIRATIONS STIR
HE CANNOT CHOOSE BUT ERR
MEPHISTOPHELES
MY THANKS I FIND THE DEAD NO ACQUISITION
AND NEVER CARED TO HAVE THEM IN MY KEEPING
I MUCH PREFER THE CHEEKS WHERE RUDDY BLOOD IS LEAPING
AND WHEN A CORPSE APPROACHES CLOSE MY HOUSE
IT GOES WITH ME AS WITH THE CAT THE MOUSE
THE LORD
ENOUGH WHAT THOU HAST ASKED IS GRANTED
TURN OFF THIS SPIRIT FROM HIS FOUNTAIN HEAD
TO TRAP HIM LET THY SNARES BE PLANTED
AND HIM WITH THEE BE DOWNWARD LED
THEN STAND ABASHED WHEN THOU ART FORCED TO SAY
A GOOD MAN THROUGH OBSCUREST ASPIRATION
HAS STILL AN INSTINCT OF THE ONE TRUE WAY
MEPHISTOPHELES
AGREED BUT 'TIS A SHORT PROBATION
ABOUT MY BET I FEEL NO TREPIDATION
IF I FULFILL MY EXPECTATION
YOU'LL LET ME TRIUMPH WITH A SWELLING BREAST
DUST SHALL HE EAT AND WITH A ZEST
AS DID A CERTAIN SNAKE MY NEAR RELATION
THE LORD
THEREIN THOU'RT FREE ACCORDING TO THY MERITS
THE LIKE OF THEE HAVE NEVER MOVED MY HATE
OF ALL THE BOLD DENYING SPIRITS
THE WAGGISH KNAVE LEAST TROUBLE DOTH CREATE
MAN'S ACTIVE NATURE FLAGGING SEEKS TOO SOON THE LEVEL
UNQUALIFIED REPOSE HE LEARNS TO CRAVE
WHENCE WILLINGLY THE COMRADE HIM I GAVE
WHO WORKS EXCITES AND MUST CREATE AS DEVIL
BUT YE GOD'S SONS IN LOVE AND DUTY
ENJOY THE RICH THE EVER LIVING BEAUTY
CREATIVE POWER THAT WORKS ETERNAL SCHEMES
CLASP YOU IN BONDS OF LOVE RELAXING NEVER
AND WHAT IN WAVERING APPARITION GLEAMS
FIX IN ITS PLACE WITH THOUGHTS THAT STAND FOREVER
HEAVEN CLOSES THE ARCHANGELS SEPARATE
MEPHISTOPHELES SOLUS
I LIKE AT TIMES TO HEAR THE ANCIENT'S WORD
AND HAVE A CARE TO BE MOST CIVIL
IT'S REALLY KIND OF SUCH A NOBLE LORD
SO HUMANLY TO GOSSIP WITH THE DEVIL

FIRST PART OF THE TRAGEDY

NIGHT
A LOFTY ARCHED NARROW GOTHIC CHAMBER
FAUST IN A CHAIR AT HIS
DESK RESTLESS
FAUST
I'VE STUDIED NOW PHILOSOPHY
AND JURISPRUDENCE MEDICINE
AND EVEN ALAS THEOLOGY
FROM END TO END WITH LABOR KEEN
AND HERE POOR FOOL WITH ALL MY LORE
I STAND NO WISER THAN BEFORE
I'M MAGISTER YEA DOCTOR HIGHT
AND STRAIGHT OR CROSS WISE WRONG OR RIGHT
THESE TEN YEARS LONG WITH MANY WOES
I'VE LED MY SCHOLARS BY THE NOSE
AND SEE THAT NOTHING CAN BE KNOWN
THAT KNOWLEDGE CUTS ME TO THE BONE
I'M CLEVERER TRUE THAN THOSE FOPS OF TEACHERS
DOCTORS AND MAGISTERS SCRIBES AND PREACHERS
NEITHER SCRUPLES NOR DOUBTS COME NOW TO SMITE ME
NOR HELL NOR DEVIL CAN LONGER AFFRIGHT ME
FOR THIS ALL PLEASURE AM I FOREGOING
I DO NOT PRETEND TO AUGHT WORTH KNOWING
I DO NOT PRETEND I COULD BE A TEACHER
TO HELP OR CONVERT A FELLOW CREATURE
THEN TOO I'VE NEITHER LANDS NOR GOLD
NOR THE WORLD'S LEAST POMP OR HONOR HOLD
NO DOG WOULD ENDURE SUCH A CURST EXISTENCE
WHEREFORE FROM MAGIC I SEEK ASSISTANCE
THAT MANY A SECRET PERCHANCE I REACH
THROUGH SPIRIT POWER AND SPIRIT SPEECH
AND THUS THE BITTER TASK FOREGO
OF SAYING THE THINGS I DO NOT KNOW
THAT I MAY DETECT THE INMOST FORCE
WHICH BINDS THE WORLD AND GUIDES ITS COURSE
ITS GERMS PRODUCTIVE POWERS EXPLORE
AND RUMMAGE IN EMPTY WORDS NO MORE
O FULL AND SPLENDID MOON WHOM I
HAVE FROM THIS DESK SEEN CLIMB THE SKY
SO MANY A MIDNIGHT WOULD THY GLOW
FOR THE LAST TIME BEHELD MY WOE
EVER THINE EYE MOST MOURNFUL FRIEND
O'ER BOOKS AND PAPERS SAW ME BEND
BUT WOULD THAT I ON MOUNTAINS GRAND
AMID THY BLESSED LIGHT COULD STAND
WITH SPIRITS THROUGH MOUNTAIN CAVERNS HOVER
FLOAT IN THY TWILIGHT THE MEADOWS OVER
AND FREED FROM THE FUMES OF LORE THAT SWATHE ME
TO HEALTH IN THY DEWY FOUNTAINS BATHE ME
AH ME THIS DUNGEON STILL I SEE
THIS DREAR ACCURSED MASONRY
WHERE EVEN THE WELCOME DAYLIGHT STRAINS
BUT DUSKLY THROUGH THE PAINTED PANES
HEMMED IN BY MANY A TOPPLING HEAP
OF BOOKS WORM EATEN GRAY WITH DUST
WHICH TO THE VAULTED CEILING CREEP
AGAINST THE SMOKY PAPER THRUST
WITH GLASSES BOXES ROUND ME STACKED
AND INSTRUMENTS TOGETHER HURLED
ANCESTRAL LUMBER STUFFED AND PACKED
SUCH IS MY WORLD AND WHAT A WORLD
AND DO I ASK WHEREFORE MY HEART
FALTERS OPPRESSED WITH UNKNOWN NEEDS
WHY SOME INEXPLICABLE SMART
ALL MOVEMENT OF MY LIFE IMPEDES
ALAS IN LIVING NATURE'S STEAD
WHERE GOD HIS HUMAN CREATURE SET
IN SMOKE AND MOULD THE FLESHLESS DEAD
AND BONES OF BEASTS SURROUND ME YET
FLY UP AND SEEK THE BROAD FREE LAND
AND THIS ONE BOOK OF MYSTERY
FROM NOSTRADAMUS' VERY HAND
IS'T NOT SUFFICIENT COMPANY
WHEN I THE STARRY COURSES KNOW
AND NATURE'S WISE INSTRUCTION SEEK
WITH LIGHT OF POWER MY SOUL SHALL GLOW
AS WHEN TO SPIRITS SPIRITS SPEAK
TIS VAIN THIS EMPTY BROODING HERE
THOUGH GUESSED THE HOLY SYMBOLS BE
YE SPIRITS COME YE HOVER NEAR
OH IF YOU HEAR ME ANSWER ME
HE OPENS THE BOOK AND PERCEIVES THE SIGN OF THE MACROCOSM
HA WHAT A SUDDEN RAPTURE LEAPS FROM THIS
I VIEW THROUGH ALL MY SENSES SWIFTLY FLOWING
I FEEL A YOUTHFUL HOLY VITAL BLISS
IN EVERY VEIN AND FIBRE NEWLY GLOWING
WAS IT A GOD WHO TRACED THIS SIGN
WITH CALM ACROSS MY TUMULT STEALING
MY TROUBLED HEART TO JOY UNSEALING
WITH IMPULSE MYSTIC AND DIVINE
THE POWERS OF NATURE HERE AROUND MY PATH REVEALING
AM I A GOD SO CLEAR MINE EYES
IN THESE PURE FEATURES I BEHOLD
CREATIVE NATURE TO MY SOUL UNFOLD
WHAT SAYS THE SAGE NOW FIRST I RECOGNIZE
THE SPIRIT WORLD NO CLOSURES FASTEN
THY SENSE IS SHUT THY HEART IS DEAD
DISCIPLE UP UNTIRING HASTEN
TO BATHE THY BREAST IN MORNING RED
HE CONTEMPLATES THE SIGN
HOW EACH THE WHOLE ITS SUBSTANCE GIVES
EACH IN THE OTHER WORKS AND LIVES
LIKE HEAVENLY FORCES RISING AND DESCENDING
THEIR GOLDEN URNS RECIPROCALLY LENDING
WITH WINGS THAT WINNOW BLESSING
FROM HEAVEN THROUGH EARTH I SEE THEM PRESSING
FILLING THE ALL WITH HARMONY UNCEASING
HOW GRAND A SHOW BUT AH A SHOW ALONE

EARTH SPIRIT
HOW OTHERWISE UPON ME WORKS THIS SIGN

NEW STRENGTH AND HEART TO MEET THE WORLD INCITE ME

NO CRASH OF SHIPWRECK SHALL HAVE POWER TO FRIGHT ME
CLOUDS GATHER OVER ME
THE MOON CONCEALS HER LIGHT

MISTS RISE RED ANGRY RAYS ARE DARTING
AROUND MY HEAD THERE FALLS
A HORROR FROM THE VAULTED ROOF

WAGNER
PARDON I HEARD YOUR DECLAMATION
'TWAS SURE AN OLD GREEK TRAGEDY YOU READ
IN SUCH AN ART I CRAVE SOME PREPARATION
SINCE NOW IT STANDS ONE IN GOOD STEAD
I'VE OFTEN HEARD IT SAID A PREACHER
MIGHT LEARN WITH A COMEDIAN FOR A TEACHER
FAUST
YES WHEN THE PRIEST COMEDIAN IS BY NATURE
AS HAPLY NOW AND THEN THE CASE MAY BE
WAGNER
AH WHEN ONE STUDIES THUS A PRISONED CREATURE
THAT SCARCE THE WORLD ON HOLIDAYS CAN SEE
SCARCE THROUGH A GLASS BY RARE OCCASION
HOW SHALL ONE LEAD IT BY PERSUASION
FAUST
YOU'LL NE'ER ATTAIN IT SAVE YOU KNOW THE FEELING
SAVE FROM THE SOUL IT RISES CLEAR
SERENE IN PRIMAL STRENGTH COMPELLING
THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF ALL WHO HEAR
YOU SIT FOREVER GLUING PATCHING
YOU COOK THE SCRAPS FROM OTHERS' FARE
AND FROM YOUR HEAP OF ASHES HATCHING
A STARVELING FLAME YE BLOW IT BARE
TAKE CHILDREN'S MONKEYS' GAZE ADMIRING
IF SUCH YOUR TASTE AND BE CONTENT
BUT NE'ER FROM HEART TO HEART YOU'LL SPEAK INSPIRING
SAVE YOUR OWN HEART IS ELOQUENT

YET THROUGH DELIVERY ORATORS SUCCEED
I FEEL THAT I AM FAR BEHIND INDEED
FAUST
SEEK THOU THE HONEST RECOMPENSE
BEWARE A TINKLING FOOL TO BE
WITH LITTLE ART CLEAR WIT AND SENSE
SUGGEST THEIR OWN DELIVERY
AND IF THOU'RT MOVED TO SPEAK IN EARNEST
WHAT NEED THAT AFTER WORDS THOU YEARNEST
YES YOUR DISCOURSES WITH THEIR GLITTERING SHOW
WHERE YE FOR MEN TWIST SHREDDED THOUGHT LIKE PAPER
ARE UNREFRESHING AS THE WINDS THAT BLOW
THE RUSTLING LEAVES THROUGH CHILL AUTUMNAL VAPOR

AH GOD BUT ART IS LONG

AND OFT WITH ZEAL MY CRITIC DUTIES MEETING
IN HEAD AND BREAST THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
HOW HARD IT IS TO COMPASS THE ASSISTANCE
WHEREBY ONE RISES TO THE SOURCE
AND HAPLY ERE ONE TRAVELS HALF THE COURSE
MUST THE POOR DEVIL QUIT EXISTENCE
FAUST
IS PARCHMENT THEN THE HOLY FOUNT BEFORE THEE
A DRAUGHT WHEREFROM THY THIRST FOREVER SLAKES
NO TRUE REFRESHMENT CAN RESTORE THEE
SAVE WHAT FROM THINE OWN SOUL SPONTANEOUS BREAKS

PARDON A GREAT DELIGHT IS GRANTED
WHEN IN THE SPIRIT OF THE AGES PLANTED
WE MARK HOW ERE OUR TIMES A SAGE HAS THOUGHT
AND THEN HOW FAR HIS WORK AND GRANDLY WE HAVE BROUGHT
FAUST
O YES UP TO THE STARS AT LAST
LISTEN MY FRIEND THE AGES THAT ARE PAST
ARE NOW A BOOK WITH SEVEN SEALS PROTECTED
WHAT YOU THE SPIRIT OF THE AGES CALL
IS NOTHING BUT THE SPIRIT OF YOU ALL
WHEREIN THE AGES ARE REFLECTED
SO OFTENTIMES YOU MISERABLY MAR IT
AT THE FIRST GLANCE WHO SEES IT RUNS AWAY
AN OFFAL BARREL AND A LUMBER GARRET
OR AT THE BEST A PUNCH AND JUDY PLAY
WITH MAXIMS MOST PRAGMATICAL AND HITTING
AS IN THE MOUTHS OF PUPPETS ARE BEFITTING

BUT THEN THE WORLD THE HUMAN HEART AND BRAIN
OF THESE ONE COVETS SOME SLIGHT APPREHENSION
FAUST
YES OF THE KIND WHICH MEN ATTAIN
WHO DARES THE CHILD'S TRUE NAME IN PUBLIC MENTION
THE FEW WHO THEREOF SOMETHING REALLY LEARNED
UNWISELY FRANK WITH HEARTS THAT SPURNED CONCEALING
AND TO THE MOB LAID BARE EACH THOUGHT AND FEELING
HAVE EVERMORE BEEN CRUCIFIED AND BURNED
I PRAY YOU FRIEND 'TIS NOW THE DEAD OF NIGHT
OUR CONVERSE HERE MUST BE SUSPENDED
WAGNER
I WOULD HAVE SHARED YOUR WATCHES WITH DELIGHT
THAT SO OUR LEARNED TALK MIGHT BE EXTENDED
TO MORROW THOUGH I'LL ASK IN EASTER LEISURE
THIS AND THE OTHER QUESTION AT YOUR PLEASURE
MOST ZEALOUSLY I SEEK FOR ERUDITION
MUCH DO I KNOW BUT TO KNOW ALL IS MY AMBITION
EXIT
FAUST SOLUS
THAT BRAIN ALONE NOT LOSES HOPE WHOSE CHOICE IS
TO STICK IN SHALLOW TRASH FOREVERMORE
WHICH DIGS WITH EAGER HAND FOR BURIED ORE
AND WHEN IT FINDS AN ANGLE WORM REJOICES
DARE SUCH A HUMAN VOICE DISTURB THE FLOW
AROUND ME HERE OF SPIRIT PRESENCE FULLEST
AND YET THIS ONCE MY THANKS I OWE
TO THEE OF ALL EARTH'S SONS THE POOREST DULLEST
FOR THOU HAST TORN ME FROM THAT DESPERATE STATE
WHICH THREATENED SOON TO OVERWHELM MY SENSES
THE APPARITION WAS SO GIANT GREAT
IT DWARFED AND WITHERED ALL MY SOUL'S PRETENCES
I IMAGE OF THE GODHEAD WHO BEGAN
DEEMING ETERNAL TRUTH SECURE IN NEARNESS
YE CHOIRS HAVE YE BEGUN THE SWEET CONSOLING CHANT
WHICH THROUGH THE NIGHT OF DEATH THE ANGELS MINISTRANT
SANG GOD'S NEW COVENANT REPEATING
CHORUS OF WOMEN
WITH SPICES AND PRECIOUS
BALM WE ARRAYED HIM
FAITHFUL AND GRACIOUS
WE TENDERLY LAID HIM
LINEN TO BIND HIM
CLEANLILY WOUND WE

CHORUS OF ANGELS
CHRIST IS ASCENDED
BLISS HATH INVESTED HIM
WOES THAT MOLESTED HIM
TRIALS THAT TESTED HIM
GLORIOUSLY ENDED

WHY HERE IN DUST ENTICE ME WITH YOUR SPELL
YE GENTLE POWERFUL SOUNDS OF HEAVEN
PEAL RATHER THERE WHERE TENDER NATURES DWELL
YOUR MESSAGES I HEAR BUT FAITH HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN
THE DEAREST CHILD OF FAITH IS MIRACLE
I VENTURE NOT TO SOAR TO YONDER REGIONS
WHENCE THE GLAD TIDINGS HITHER FLOAT
AND YET FROM CHILDHOOD UP FAMILIAR WITH THE NOTE
TO LIFE IT NOW RENEWS THE OLD ALLEGIANCE
ONCE HEAVENLY LOVE SENT DOWN A BURNING KISS
UPON MY BROW IN SABBATH SILENCE HOLY
AND FILLED WITH MYSTIC PRESAGE CHIMED THE CHURCH BELL SLOWLY
AND PRAYER DISSOLVED ME IN A FERVENT BLISS
A SWEET UNCOMPREHENDED YEARNING
DROVE FORTH MY FEET THROUGH WOODS AND MEADOWS FREE
AND WHILE A THOUSAND TEARS WERE BURNING
I FELT A WORLD ARISE FOR ME
THESE CHANTS TO YOUTH AND ALL ITS SPORTS APPEALING
PROCLAIMED THE SPRING'S REJOICING HOLIDAY
AND MEMORY HOLDS ME NOW WITH CHILDISH FEELING
BACK FROM THE LAST THE SOLEMN WAY
SOUND ON YE HYMNS OF HEAVEN SO SWEET AND MILD
MY TEARS GUSH FORTH THE EARTH TAKES BACK HER CHILD

DON'T BE SO PROUD I'LL HOLD MY TONGUE
AND WHAT YOU'D LIKE I'LL UNDERTAKE TO GET YOU
CITIZEN'S DAUGHTER
COME AGATHA I SHUN THE WITCH'S SIGHT
BEFORE FOLKS LEST THERE BE MISGIVING
'TIS TRUE SHE SHOWED ME ON SAINT ANDREW'S NIGHT
MY FUTURE SWEETHEART JUST AS HE WERE LIVING
THE OTHER
SHE SHOWED ME MINE IN CRYSTAL CLEAR
WITH SEVERAL WILD YOUNG BLADES A SOLDIER LOVER
I SEEK HIM EVERYWHERE I PRY AND PEER
AND YET SOMEHOW HIS FACE I CAN'T DISCOVER
SOLDIERS
CASTLES WITH LOFTY
RAMPARTS AND TOWERS
MAIDENS DISDAINFUL
IN BEAUTY'S ARRAY
BOTH SHALL BE OURS
BOLD IS THE VENTURE
SPLENDID THE PAY
LADS LET THE TRUMPETS
FOR US BE SUING
CALLING TO PLEASURE
CALLING TO RUIN
STORMY OUR LIFE IS
SUCH IS ITS BOON
MAIDENS AND CASTLES
CAPITULATE SOON
BOLD IS THE VENTURE
SPLENDID THE PAY
AND THE SOLDIERS GO MARCHING
MARCHING AWAY
FAUST AND WAGNER
FAUST
RELEASED FROM ICE ARE BROOK AND RIVER
BY THE QUICKENING GLANCE OF THE GRACIOUS SPRING
THE COLORS OF HOPE TO THE VALLEY CLING
AND WEAK OLD WINTER HIMSELF MUST SHIVER
WITHDRAWN TO THE MOUNTAINS A CROWNLESS KING
WHENCE EVER RETREATING HE SENDS AGAIN
IMPOTENT SHOWERS OF SLEET THAT DARKLE
IN BELTS ACROSS THE GREEN O' THE PLAIN
BUT THE SUN WILL PERMIT NO WHITE TO SPARKLE
EVERYWHERE FORM IN DEVELOPMENT MOVETH
HE WILL BRIGHTEN THE WORLD WITH THE TINTS HE LOVETH
AND LACKING BLOSSOMS BLUE YELLOW AND RED
HE TAKES THESE GAUDY PEOPLE INSTEAD
TURN THEE ABOUT AND FROM THIS HEIGHT
BACK ON THE TOWN DIRECT THY SIGHT
OUT OF THE HOLLOW GLOOMY GATE
THE MOTLEY THRONGS COME FORTH ELATE
EACH WILL THE JOY OF THE SUNSHINE HOARD
TO HONOR THE DAY OF THE RISEN LORD
THEY FEEL THEMSELVES THEIR RESURRECTION
FROM THE LOW DARK ROOMS SCARCE HABITABLE
FROM THE BONDS OF WORK FROM TRADE'S RESTRICTION
FROM THE PRESSING WEIGHT OF ROOF AND GABLE
FROM THE NARROW CRUSHING STREETS AND ALLEYS
FROM THE CHURCHES' SOLEMN AND REVEREND NIGHT
ALL COME FORTH TO THE CHEERFUL LIGHT
HOW LIVELY SEE THE MULTITUDE SALLIES
SCATTERING THROUGH GARDENS AND FIELDS REMOTE
WHILE OVER THE RIVER THAT BROADLY DALLIES
DANCES SO MANY A FESTIVE BOAT
AND OVERLADEN NIGH TO SINKING
THE LAST FULL WHERRY TAKES THE STREAM
YONDER AFAR FROM THE HILL PATHS BLINKING
THEIR CLOTHES ARE COLORS THAT SOFTLY GLEAM
I HEAR THE NOISE OF THE VILLAGE EVEN
HERE IS THE PEOPLE'S PROPER HEAVEN
HERE HIGH AND LOW CONTENTED SEE
HERE I AM MAN DARE MAN TO BE
WAGNER
TO STROLL WITH YOU SIR DOCTOR FLATTERS
'TIS HONOR PROFIT UNTO ME
BUT I ALONE WOULD SHUN THESE SHALLOW MATTERS
SINCE ALL THAT'S COARSE PROVOKES MY ENMITY
THIS FIDDLING SHOUTING TEN PIN ROLLING
I HATE THESE NOISES OF THE THRONG
THEY RAVE AS SATAN WERE THEIR SPORTS CONTROLLING
AND CALL IT MIRTH AND CALL IT SONG
PEASANTS UNDER THE LINDEN TREE
DANCE AND SONG
ALL FOR THE DANCE THE SHEPHERD DRESSED
IN RIBBONS WREATH AND GAYEST VEST
HIMSELF WITH CARE ARRAYING
AROUND THE LINDEN LASS AND LAD
ALREADY FOOTED IT LIKE MAD
HURRAH HURRAH
HURRAH TARARA LA
THE FIDDLE BOW WAS PLAYING
HE BROKE THE RANKS NO WHIT AFRAID
AND WITH HIS ELBOW PUNCHED A MAID
WHO STOOD THE DANCE SURVEYING
THE BUXOM WENCH SHE TURNED AND SAID
NOW YOU I CALL A STUPID HEAD
HURRAH HURRAH
HURRAH TARARA LA
BE DECENT WHILE YOU'RE STAYING
THEN ROUND THE CIRCLE WENT THEIR FLIGHT
THEY DANCED TO LEFT THEY DANCED TO RIGHT
THEIR KIRTLES ALL WERE PLAYING
THEY FIRST GREW RED AND THEN GREW WARM
AND RESTED PANTING ARM IN ARM
HURRAH HURRAH
HURRAH TARARA LA
AND HIPS AND ELBOWS STRAYING
NOW DON'T BE SO FAMILIAR HERE
HOW MANY A ONE HAS FOOLED HIS DEAR
WAYLAYING AND BETRAYING
AND YET HE COAXED HER SOON ASIDE
AND ROUND THE LINDEN SOUNDED WIDE
HURRAH HURRAH
HURRAH TARARA LA
AND THE FIDDLE BOW WAS PLAYING
OLD PEASANT
SIR DOCTOR IT IS GOOD OF YOU
THAT THUS YOU CONDESCEND TO DAY
AMONG THIS CROWD OF MERRY FOLK
A HIGHLY LEARNED MAN TO STRAY
THEN ALSO TAKE THE FINEST CAN
WE FILL WITH FRESH WINE FOR YOUR SAKE
I OFFER IT AND HUMBLY WISH
THAT NOT ALONE YOUR THIRST IS SLAKE
THAT AS THE DROPS BELOW ITS BRINK
SO MANY DAYS OF LIFE YOU DRINK
FAUST
I TAKE THE CUP YOU KINDLY REACH
WITH THANKS AND HEALTH TO ALL AND EACH
THE PEOPLE GATHER IN A CIRCLE ABOUT HIM
OLD PEASANT
IN TRUTH 'TIS WELL AND FITLY TIMED
THAT NOW OUR DAY OF JOY YOU SHARE
WHO HERETOFORE IN EVIL DAYS
GAVE US SO MUCH OF HELPING CARE
STILL MANY A MAN STANDS LIVING HERE
SAVED BY YOUR FATHER'S SKILLFUL HAND
THAT SNATCHED HIM FROM THE FEVER'S RAGE
AND STAYED THE PLAGUE IN ALL THE LAND
THEN ALSO YOU THOUGH BUT A YOUTH
WENT INTO EVERY HOUSE OF PAIN
MANY THE CORPSES CARRIED FORTH
BUT YOU IN HEALTH CAME OUT AGAIN
FAUST
NO TEST OR TRIAL YOU EVADED
A HELPING GOD THE HELPER AIDED
ALL
HEALTH TO THE MAN SO SKILLED AND TRIED
THAT FOR OUR HELP HE LONG MAY ABIDE
FAUST
TO HIM ABOVE BOW DOWN MY FRIENDS
WHO TEACHES HELP AND SUCCOR SENDS
HE GOES ON WITH WAGNER
WAGNER
WITH WHAT A FEELING THOU GREAT MAN MUST THOU
RECEIVE THE PEOPLE'S HONEST VENERATION
HOW LUCKY HE WHOSE GIFTS HIS STATION
WITH SUCH ADVANTAGES ENDOW
THOU'RT SHOWN TO ALL THE YOUNGER GENERATION
EACH ASKS AND PRESSES NEAR TO GAZE
THE FIDDLE STOPS THE DANCE DELAYS
THOU GOEST THEY STAND IN ROWS TO SEE
AND ALL THE CAPS ARE LIFTED HIGH
A LITTLE MORE AND THEY WOULD BEND THE KNEE
AS IF THE HOLY HOST CAME BY
FAUST
A FEW MORE STEPS ASCEND AS FAR AS YONDER STONE
HERE FROM OUR WANDERING WILL WE REST CONTENTED
HERE LOST IN THOUGHT I'VE LINGERED OFT ALONE
WHEN FOOLISH FASTS AND PRAYERS MY LIFE TORMENTED
HERE RICH IN HOPE AND FIRM IN FAITH
WITH TEARS WRUNG HANDS AND SIGHS I'VE STRIVEN
THE END OF THAT FAR SPREADING DEATH
ENTREATING FROM THE LORD OF HEAVEN
NOW LIKE CONTEMPT THE CROWD'S APPLAUSES SEEM
COULDST THOU BUT READ WITHIN MINE INMOST SPIRIT
HOW LITTLE NOW I DEEM
THAT SIRE OR SON SUCH PRAISES MERIT
MY FATHER'S WAS A SOMBRE BROODING BRAIN
WHICH THROUGH THE HOLY SPHERES OF NATURE GROPED AND WANDERED
AND HONESTLY IN HIS OWN FASHION PONDERED
WITH LABOR WHIMSICAL AND PAIN
WHO IN HIS DUSKY WORK SHOP BENDING
WITH PROVED ADEPTS IN COMPANY
MADE FROM HIS RECIPES UNENDING
OPPOSING SUBSTANCES AGREE
THERE WAS A LION RED A WOOER DARING
WITHIN THE LILY'S TEPID BATH ESPOUSED
AND BOTH TORMENTED THEN BY FLAME UNSPARING
BY TURNS IN EITHER BRIDAL CHAMBER HOUSED
IF THEN APPEARED WITH COLORS SPLENDID
THE YOUNG QUEEN IN HER CRYSTAL SHELL
THIS WAS THE MEDICINE THE PATIENTS' WOES SOON ENDED
AND NONE DEMANDED WHO GOT WELL
THUS WE OUR HELLISH BOLUSES COMPOUNDING
AMONG THESE VALES AND HILLS SURROUNDING
WORSE THAN THE PESTILENCE HAVE PASSED
THOUSANDS WERE DONE TO DEATH FROM POISON OF MY GIVING
AND I MUST HEAR BY ALL THE LIVING
THE SHAMELESS MURDERERS PRAISED AT LAST
WAGNER
WHY THEREFORE YIELD TO SUCH DEPRESSION
A GOOD MAN DOES HIS HONEST SHARE
IN EXERCISING WITH THE STRICTEST CARE
THE ART BEQUEATHED TO HIS POSSESSION
DOST THOU THY FATHER HONOR AS A YOUTH
THEN MAY HIS TEACHING CHEERFULLY IMPEL THEE
DOST THOU AS MAN INCREASE THE STORES OF TRUTH
THEN MAY THINE OWN SON AFTERWARDS EXCEL THEE
FAUST
O HAPPY HE WHO STILL RENEWS
THE HOPE FROM ERROR'S DEEPS TO RISE FOREVER
THAT WHICH ONE DOES NOT KNOW ONE NEEDS TO USE
AND WHAT ONE KNOWS ONE USES NEVER
BUT LET US NOT BY SUCH DESPONDENCE SO
THE FORTUNE OF THIS HOUR EMBITTER
MARK HOW BENEATH THE EVENING SUNLIGHT'S GLOW
THE GREEN EMBOSOMED HOUSES GLITTER
THE GLOW RETREATS DONE IS THE DAY OF TOIL
IT YONDER HASTES NEW FIELDS OF LIFE EXPLORING
AH THAT NO WING CAN LIFT ME FROM THE SOIL
UPON ITS TRACK TO FOLLOW FOLLOW SOARING
THEN WOULD I SEE ETERNAL EVENING GILD
THE SILENT WORLD BENEATH ME GLOWING
ON FIRE EACH MOUNTAIN PEAK WITH PEACE EACH VALLEY FILLED
THE SILVER BROOK TO GOLDEN RIVERS FLOWING
THE MOUNTAIN CHAIN WITH ALL ITS GORGES DEEP
WOULD THEN NO MORE IMPEDE MY GODLIKE MOTION
AND NOW BEFORE MINE EYES EXPANDS THE OCEAN
WITH ALL ITS BAYS IN SHINING SLEEP
YET FINALLY THE WEARY GOD IS SINKING
THE NEW BORN IMPULSE FIRES MY MIND
I HASTEN ON HIS BEAMS ETERNAL DRINKING
THE DAY BEFORE ME AND THE NIGHT BEHIND
ABOVE ME HEAVEN UNFURLED THE FLOOR OF WAVES BENEATH ME
A GLORIOUS DREAM THOUGH NOW THE GLORIES FADE
ALAS THE WINGS THAT LIFT THE MIND NO AID
OF WINGS TO LIFT THE BODY CAN BEQUEATH ME
YET IN EACH SOUL IS BORN THE PLEASURE
OF YEARNING ONWARD UPWARD AND AWAY
WHEN O'ER OUR HEADS LOST IN THE VAULTED AZURE
THE LARK SENDS DOWN HIS FLICKERING LAY
WHEN OVER CRAGS AND PINY HIGHLANDS
THE POISING EAGLE SLOWLY SOARS
AND OVER PLAINS AND LAKES AND ISLANDS
THE CRANE SAILS BY TO OTHER SHORES
WAGNER
I'VE HAD MYSELF AT TIMES SOME ODD CAPRICES
BUT NEVER YET SUCH IMPULSE FELT AS THIS IS
ONE SOON FATIGUES ON WOODS AND FIELDS TO LOOK
NOR WOULD I BEG THE BIRD HIS WING TO SPARE US
HOW OTHERWISE THE MENTAL RAPTURES BEAR US
FROM PAGE TO PAGE FROM BOOK TO BOOK
THEN WINTER NIGHTS TAKE LOVELINESS UNTOLD
AS WARMER LIFE IN EVERY LIMB HAD CROWNED YOU
AND WHEN YOUR HANDS UNROLL SOME PARCHMENT RARE AND OLD
ALL HEAVEN DESCENDS AND OPENS BRIGHT AROUND YOU
FAUST
ONE IMPULSE ART THOU CONSCIOUS OF AT BEST
O NEVER SEEK TO KNOW THE OTHER
TWO SOULS ALAS RESIDE WITHIN MY BREAST
AND EACH WITHDRAWS FROM AND REPELS ITS BROTHER
ONE WITH TENACIOUS ORGANS HOLDS IN LOVE
AND CLINGING LUST THE WORLD IN ITS EMBRACES
THE OTHER STRONGLY SWEEPS THIS DUST ABOVE
INTO THE HIGH ANCESTRAL SPACES
IF THERE BE AIRY SPIRITS NEAR
'TWIXT HEAVEN AND EARTH ON POTENT ERRANDS FLEEING
LET THEM DROP DOWN THE GOLDEN ATMOSPHERE
AND BEAR ME FORTH TO NEW AND VARIED BEING
YEA IF A MAGIC MANTLE ONCE WERE MINE
TO WAFT ME O'ER THE WORLD AT PLEASURE
I WOULD NOT FOR THE COSTLIEST STORES OF TREASURE
NOT FOR A MONARCH'S ROBE THE GIFT RESIGN
WAGNER
INVOKE NOT THUS THE WELL KNOWN THRONG
WHICH THROUGH THE FIRMAMENT DIFFUSED IS FARING
AND DANGER THOUSAND FOLD OUR RACE TO WRONG
IN EVERY QUARTER IS PREPARING
SWIFT FROM THE NORTH THE SPIRIT FANGS SO SHARP
SWEEP DOWN AND WITH THEIR BARBD POINTS ASSAIL YOU
THEN FROM THE EAST THEY COME TO DRY AND WARP
YOUR LUNGS TILL BREATH AND BEING FAIL YOU
IF FROM THE DESERT SENDETH THEM THE SOUTH
WITH FIRE ON FIRE YOUR THROBBING FOREHEAD CROWNING
THE WEST LEADS ON A HOST TO CURE THE DROUTH
ONLY WHEN MEADOW FIELD AND YOU ARE DROWNING
THEY GLADLY HEARKEN PROMPT FOR INJURY
GLADLY OBEY BECAUSE THEY GLADLY CHEAT US
FROM HEAVEN THEY REPRESENT THEMSELVES TO BE
AND LISP LIKE ANGELS WHEN WITH LIES THEY MEET US
BUT LET US GO 'TIS GRAY AND DUSKY ALL
THE AIR IS COLD THE VAPORS FALL
AT NIGHT ONE LEARNS HIS HOUSE TO PRIZE
WHY STAND YOU THUS WITH SUCH ASTONISHED EYES
WHAT IN THE TWILIGHT CAN YOUR MIND SO TROUBLE
FAUST
SEEST THOU THE BLACK DOG COURSING THERE THROUGH CORN AND
STUBBLE
WAGNER
LONG SINCE YET DEEMED HIM NOT IMPORTANT IN THE LEAST
FAUST
INSPECT HIM CLOSE FOR WHAT TAK'ST THOU THE BEAST
WAGNER
WHY FOR A POODLE WHO HAS LOST HIS MASTER
AND SCENTS ABOUT HIS TRACK TO FIND
FAUST
SEEST THOU THE SPIRAL CIRCLES NARROWING FASTER
WHICH HE APPROACHING ROUND US SEEMS TO WIND
A STREAMING TRAIL OF FIRE IF I SEE RIGHTLY
FOLLOWS HIS PATH OF MYSTERY
WAGNER
IT MAY BE THAT YOUR EYES DECEIVE YOU SLIGHTLY
NAUGHT BUT A PLAIN BLACK POODLE DO I SEE
FAUST
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WITH ENCHANTED CUNNING
HE SNARES OUR FEET SOME FUTURE CHAIN TO BIND
WAGNER
I SEE HIM TIMIDLY IN DOUBT AROUND US RUNNING
SINCE IN HIS MASTER'S STEAD TWO STRANGERS DOTH HE FIND
FAUST
THE CIRCLE NARROWS HE IS NEAR
WAGNER
A DOG THOU SEEST AND NOT A PHANTOM HERE
BEHOLD HIM STOP UPON HIS BELLY CRAWL HIS
TAIL SET WAGGING CANINE HABITS ALL
FAUST
COME FOLLOW US COME HERE AT LEAST
WAGNER
'TIS THE ABSURDEST DROLLEST BEAST
STAND STILL AND YOU WILL SEE HIM WAIT
ADDRESS HIM AND HE GAMBOLS STRAIGHT
IF SOMETHING'S LOST HE'LL QUICKLY BRING IT
YOUR CANE IF IN THE STREAM YOU FLING IT
FAUST
NO DOUBT YOU'RE RIGHT NO TRACE OF MIND I OWN
IS IN THE BEAST I SEE BUT DRILL ALONE
WAGNER
THE DOG WHEN HE'S WELL EDUCATED
IS BY THE WISEST TOLERATED
YES HE DESERVES YOUR FAVOR THOROUGHLY
THE CLEVER SCHOLAR OF THE STUDENTS HE
THEY PASS IN THE CITY GATE

THE STUDY
FAUST
ENTERING WITH THE POODLE
BEHIND ME FIELD AND MEADOW SLEEPING
I LEAVE IN DEEP PROPHETIC NIGHT
WITHIN WHOSE DREAD AND HOLY KEEPING
THE BETTER SOUL AWAKES TO LIGHT
THE WILD DESIRES NO LONGER WIN US
THE DEEDS OF PASSION CEASE TO CHAIN
THE LOVE OF MAN REVIVES WITHIN US
THE LOVE OF GOD REVIVES AGAIN
BE STILL THOU POODLE MAKE NOT SUCH RACKET AND RIOT
WHY AT THE THRESHOLD WILT SNUFFING BE
BEHIND THE STOVE REPOSE THEE IN QUIET
MY SOFTEST CUSHION I GIVE TO THEE
AS THOU UP YONDER WITH RUNNING AND LEAPING
AMUSED US HAST ON THE MOUNTAIN'S CREST
SO NOW I TAKE THEE INTO MY KEEPING
A WELCOME BUT ALSO A SILENT GUEST
AH WHEN WITHIN OUR NARROW CHAMBER
THE LAMP WITH FRIENDLY LUSTRE GLOWS
FLAMES IN THE BREAST EACH FADED EMBER
AND IN THE HEART ITSELF THAT KNOWS
THEN HOPE AGAIN LENDS SWEET ASSISTANCE
AND REASON THEN RESUMES HER SPEECH
ONE YEARNS THE RIVERS OF EXISTENCE
THE VERY FOUNTS OF LIFE TO REACH
SNARL NOT POODLE TO THE SOUND THAT RISES
THE SACRED TONES THAT MY SOUL EMBRACE
THIS BESTIAL NOISE IS OUT OF PLACE
WE ARE USED TO SEE THAT MAN DESPISES
WHAT HE NEVER COMPREHENDS
AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL VILIPENDS
FINDING THEM OFTEN HARD TO MEASURE
WILL THE DOG LIKE MAN SNARL HIS DISPLEASURE
BUT AH I FEEL THOUGH WILL THERETO BE STRONGER
CONTENTMENT FLOWS FROM OUT MY BREAST NO LONGER
WHY MUST THE STREAM SO SOON RUN DRY AND FAIL US
AND BURNING THIRST AGAIN ASSAIL US
THEREIN I'VE BORNE SO MUCH PROBATION
AND YET THIS WANT MAY BE SUPPLIED US
WE CALL THE SUPERNATURAL TO GUIDE US
WE PINE AND THIRST FOR REVELATION
WHICH NOWHERE WORTHIER IS MORE NOBLY SENT
THAN HERE IN OUR NEW TESTAMENT
I FEEL IMPELLED ITS MEANING TO DETERMINE
WITH HONEST PURPOSE ONCE FOR ALL
THE HALLOWED ORIGINAL
TO CHANGE TO MY BELOVED GERMAN
HE OPENS A VOLUME AND COMMENCES
'TIS WRITTEN IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD
HERE AM I BALKED WHO NOW CAN HELP AFFORD
THE WORD IMPOSSIBLE SO HIGH TO RATE IT
AND OTHERWISE MUST I TRANSLATE IT
IF BY THE SPIRIT I AM TRULY TAUGHT
THEN THUS IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE THOUGHT
THIS FIRST LINE LET ME WEIGH COMPLETELY
LEST MY IMPATIENT PEN PROCEED TOO FLEETLY
IS IT THE THOUGHT WHICH WORKS CREATES INDEED
IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE POWER I READ
YET AS I WRITE A WARNING IS SUGGESTED
THAT I THE SENSE MAY NOT HAVE FAIRLY TESTED
THE SPIRIT AIDS ME NOW I SEE THE LIGHT
IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE ACT I WRITE
IF I MUST SHARE MY CHAMBER WITH THEE
POODLE STOP THAT HOWLING PRITHEE
CEASE TO BARK AND BELLOW
SUCH A NOISY DISTURBING FELLOW
I'LL NO LONGER SUFFER NEAR ME
ONE OF US DOST HEAR ME
MUST LEAVE I FEAR ME
NO LONGER GUEST RIGHT I BESTOW
THE DOOR IS OPEN ART FREE TO GO
BUT WHAT DO I SEE IN THE CREATURE
IS THAT IN THE COURSE OF NATURE
IS'T ACTUAL FACT OR FANCY'S SHOWS
HOW LONG AND BROAD MY POODLE GROWS
HE RISES MIGHTILY
A CANINE FORM THAT CANNOT BE
WHAT A SPECTRE I'VE HARBORED THUS
HE RESEMBLES A HIPPOPOTAMUS
WITH FIERY EYES TEETH TERRIBLE TO SEE
O NOW AM I SURE OF THEE
FOR ALL OF THY HALF HELLISH BROOD
THE KEY OF SOLOMON IS GOOD
SPIRITS IN THE CORRIDOR
SOME ONE WITHIN IS CAUGHT
STAY WITHOUT FOLLOW HIM NOT
LIKE THE FOX IN A SNARE
QUAKES THE OLD HELL LYNX THERE
TAKE HEED LOOK ABOUT
BACK AND FORTH HOVER
UNDER AND OVER
AND HE'LL WORK HIMSELF OUT
IF YOUR AID AVAIL HIM
LET IT NOT FAIL HIM
FOR HE WITHOUT MEASURE
HAS WROUGHT FOR OUR PLEASURE
FAUST
FIRST TO ENCOUNTER THE BEAST

HEAR ME EXORCISE THEE
ART THOU MY GAY ONE
HELL'S FUGITIVE STRAY ONE

WITH HAIR ALL BRISTLING IT BEGINS TO SWELL
BASE BEING HEAREST THOU
KNOWEST AND FEAREST THOU
THE ONE UNORIGINATE
NAMED INEXPRESSIBLY
THROUGH ALL HEAVEN IMPERMEATE
PIERCED IRREDRESSIBLY
BEHIND THE STOVE STILL BANNED
SEE IT AN ELEPHANT EXPAND
IT FILLS THE SPACE ENTIRE
MIST LIKE MELTING EVER FASTER
'TIS ENOUGH ASCEND NO HIGHER
LAY THYSELF AT THE FEET OF THE MASTER
THOU SEEST NOT VAIN THE THREATS I BRING THEE
WITH HOLY FIRE I'LL SCORCH AND STING THEE
WAIT NOT TO KNOW
THE THREEFOLD DAZZLING GLOW
WAIT NOT TO KNOW
THE STRONGEST ART WITHIN MY HANDS
MEPHISTOPHELES
WHILE THE VAPOR IS DISSIPATING STEPS FORTH FROM BEHIND THE
STOVE IN THE COSTUME OF A TRAVELLING SCHOLAR
WHY SUCH A NOISE WHAT ARE MY LORD'S COMMANDS
FAUST
THIS WAS THE POODLE'S REAL CORE
A TRAVELLING SCHOLAR THEN THE CASUS IS DIVERTING
MEPHISTOPHELES
THE LEARNED GENTLEMAN I BOW BEFORE
YOU'VE MADE ME ROUNDLY SWEAT THAT'S CERTAIN
FAUST
WHAT IS THY NAME
MEPHISTOPHELES
A QUESTION SMALL IT SEEMS
FOR ONE WHOSE MIND THE WORD SO MUCH DESPISES
WHO SCORNING ALL EXTERNAL GLEAMS
THE DEPTHS OF BEING ONLY PRIZES
FAUST
WITH ALL YOU GENTLEMEN THE NAME'S A TEST
WHEREBY THE NATURE USUALLY IS EXPRESSED
CLEARLY THE LATTER IT IMPLIES
IN NAMES LIKE BEELZEBUB DESTROYER FATHER OF LIES
WHO ART THOU THEN
MEPHISTOPHELES
PART OF THAT POWER NOT UNDERSTOOD
WHICH ALWAYS WILLS THE BAD AND ALWAYS WORKS THE GOOD
FAUST
WHAT HIDDEN SENSE IN THIS ENIGMA LIES
MEPHISTOPHELES
I AM THE SPIRIT THAT DENIES
AND JUSTLY SO FOR ALL THINGS FROM THE VOID
CALLED FORTH DESERVE TO BE DESTROYED
'TWERE BETTER THEN WERE NAUGHT CREATED
THUS ALL WHICH YOU AS SIN HAVE RATED
DESTRUCTION AUGHT WITH EVIL BLENT
THAT IS MY PROPER ELEMENT
FAUST
THOU NAM'ST THYSELF A PART YET SHOW'ST COMPLETE TO ME
MEPHISTOPHELES
THE MODEST TRUTH I SPEAK TO THEE
IF MAN THAT MICROCOSMIC FOOL CAN SEE
HIMSELF A WHOLE SO FREQUENTLY
PART OF THE PART AM I ONCE ALL IN PRIMAL NIGHT
PART OF THE DARKNESS WHICH BROUGHT FORTH THE LIGHT
THE HAUGHTY LIGHT WHICH NOW DISPUTES THE SPACE
AND CLAIMS OF MOTHER NIGHT HER ANCIENT PLACE
AND YET THE STRUGGLE FAILS SINCE LIGHT HOWE'ER IT WEAVES
STILL FETTERED UNTO BODIES CLEAVES
IT FLOWS FROM BODIES BODIES BEAUTIFIES
BY BODIES IS ITS COURSE IMPEDED
AND SO BUT LITTLE TIME IS NEEDED
I HOPE ERE AS THE BODIES DIE IT DIES
FAUST
I SEE THE PLAN THOU ART PURSUING
THOU CANST NOT COMPASS GENERAL RUIN
AND HAST ON SMALLER SCALE BEGUN
MEPHISTOPHELES
AND TRULY 'TIS NOT MUCH WHEN ALL IS DONE
THAT WHICH TO NAUGHT IS IN RESISTANCE SET
THE SOMETHING OF THIS CLUMSY WORLD HAS YET
WITH ALL THAT I HAVE UNDERTAKEN
NOT BEEN BY ME DISTURBED OR SHAKEN
FROM EARTHQUAKE TEMPEST WAVE VOLCANO'S BRAND
BACK INTO QUIET SETTLE SEA AND LAND
AND THAT DAMNED STUFF THE BESTIAL HUMAN BROOD
WHAT USE IN HAVING THAT TO PLAY WITH
HOW MANY HAVE I MADE AWAY WITH
AND EVER CIRCULATES A NEWER FRESHER BLOOD
IT MAKES ME FURIOUS SUCH THINGS BEHOLDING
FROM WATER EARTH AND AIR UNFOLDING
A THOUSAND GERMS BREAK FORTH AND GROW
IN DRY AND WET AND WARM AND CHILLY
AND HAD I NOT THE FLAME RESERVED WHY REALLY
THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL OF MY OWN TO SHOW
FAUST
SO TO THE ACTIVELY ETERNAL
CREATIVE FORCE IN COLD DISDAIN
YOU NOW OPPOSE THE FIST INFERNAL
WHOSE WICKED CLENCH IS ALL IN VAIN
SOME OTHER LABOR SEEK THOU RATHER
QUEER SON OF CHAOS TO BEGIN
MEPHISTOPHELES
WELL WE'LL CONSIDER THOU CANST GATHER
MY VIEWS WHEN NEXT I VENTURE IN
MIGHT I PERHAPS DEPART AT PRESENT
FAUST
WHY THOU SHOULDST ASK I DON'T PERCEIVE
THOUGH OUR ACQUAINTANCE IS SO RECENT
FOR FURTHER VISITS THOU HAST LEAVE
THE WINDOW'S HERE THE DOOR IS YONDER
A CHIMNEY ALSO YOU BEHOLD
MEPHISTOPHELES
I MUST CONFESS THAT FORTH I MAY NOT WANDER
MY STEPS BY ONE SLIGHT OBSTACLE CONTROLLED
THE WIZARD'S FOOT THAT ON YOUR THRESHOLD MADE IS
FAUST
THE PENTAGRAM PROHIBITS THEE
WHY TELL ME NOW THOU SON OF HADES
IF THAT PREVENTS HOW CAM'ST THOU IN TO ME
COULD SUCH A SPIRIT BE SO CHEATED
MEPHISTOPHELES
INSPECT THE THING THE DRAWING'S NOT COMPLETED
THE OUTER ANGLE YOU MAY SEE
IS OPEN LEFT THE LINES DON'T FIT IT
FAUST
WELL CHANCE THIS TIME HAS FAIRLY HIT IT
AND THUS THOU'RT PRISONER TO ME
IT SEEMS THE BUSINESS HAS SUCCEEDED
MEPHISTOPHELES
THE POODLE NAUGHT REMARKED AS AFTER THEE HE SPEEDED
BUT OTHER ASPECTS NOW OBTAIN
THE DEVIL CAN'T GET OUT AGAIN
FAUST
TRY THEN THE OPEN WINDOW PANE
MEPHISTOPHELES
FOR DEVILS AND FOR SPECTRES THIS IS LAW
WHERE THEY HAVE ENTERED IN THERE ALSO THEY WITHDRAW
THE FIRST IS FREE TO US WE'RE GOVERNED BY THE SECOND
FAUST
IN HELL ITSELF THEN LAWS ARE RECKONED
THAT'S WELL SO MIGHT A COMPACT BE
MADE WITH YOU GENTLEMEN AND BINDING SURELY
MEPHISTOPHELES
ALL THAT IS PROMISED SHALL DELIGHT THEE PURELY
NO SKINFLINT BARGAIN SHALT THOU SEE
BUT THIS IS NOT OF SWIFT CONCLUSION
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE MATTER SOON
AND NOW I DO ENTREAT THIS BOON
LEAVE TO WITHDRAW FROM MY INTRUSION
FAUST
ONE MOMENT MORE I ASK THEE TO REMAIN
SOME PLEASANT NEWS AT LEAST TO TELL ME
MEPHISTOPHELES
RELEASE ME NOW I SOON SHALL COME AGAIN
THEN THOU AT WILL MAYST QUESTION AND COMPEL ME
FAUST
I HAVE NOT SNARES AROUND THEE CAST
THYSELF HAST LED THYSELF INTO THE MESHES
WHO TRAPS THE DEVIL HOLD HIM FAST
NOT SOON A SECOND TIME HE'LL CATCH A PREY SO PRECIOUS
MEPHISTOPHELES
AN'T PLEASE THEE ALSO I'M CONTENT TO STAY
AND SERVE THEE IN A SOCIAL STATION
BUT STIPULATING THAT I MAY
WITH ARTS OF MINE AFFORD THEE RECREATION
FAUST
THERETO I WILLINGLY AGREE
IF THE DIVERSION PLEASANT BE
MEPHISTOPHELES
MY FRIEND THOU'LT WIN PAST ALL PRETENCES
MORE IN THIS HOUR TO SOOTHE THY SENSES
THAN IN THE YEAR'S MONOTONY
THAT WHICH THE DAINTY SPIRITS SING THEE
THE LOVELY PICTURES THEY SHALL BRING THEE
ARE MORE THAN MAGIC'S EMPTY SHOW
THY SCENT WILL BE TO BLISS INVITED
THY PALATE THEN WITH TASTE DELIGHTED

ALL UNPREPARED THE CHARM I SPIN
WE'RE HERE TOGETHER SO BEGIN
SPIRITS
VANISH YE DARKING
ARCHES ABOVE HIM
LOVELIEST WEATHER
BORN OF BLUE ETHER
BREAK FROM THE SKY
O THAT THE DARKLING
CLOUDS HAD DEPARTED
STARLIGHT IS SPARKLING
TRANQUILLER HEARTED
SUNS ARE ON HIGH
HEAVEN'S OWN CHILDREN
IN BEAUTY BEWILDERING
WAVERINGLY BENDING
PASS AS THEY HOVER
LONGING UNENDING
FOLLOWS THEM OVER
THEY WITH THEIR GLOWING
GARMENTS OUT FLOWING
COVER IN GOING
LANDSCAPE AND BOWER
WHERE IN SECLUSION
LOVERS ARE PLIGHTED
LOST IN ILLUSION
BOWER ON BOWER
TENDRILS UNBLIGHTED
LO IN A SHOWER
GRAPES THAT O'ERCLUSTER
GUSH INTO MUST OR
FLOW INTO RIVERS
OF FOAMING AND FLASHING
WINE THAT IS DASHING
GEMS AS IT BOUNDETH
DOWN THE HIGH PLACES
AND SPREADING SURROUNDETH
WITH CRYSTALLINE SPACES
IN HAPPY EMBRACES
BLOSSOMING FORELANDS
EMERALD SHORE LANDS
AND THE WINGED RACES
DRINK AND FLY ONWARD
FLY EVER SUNWARD
TO THE ENTICING
ISLANDS THAT FLATTER
DIPPING AND RISING
LIGHT ON THE WATER
HARK THE INSPIRING
SOUND OF THEIR QUIRING
SEE THE ENTRANCING
WHIRL OF THEIR DANCING
ALL IN THE AIR ARE
FREER AND FAIRER
SOME OF THEM SCALING
BOLDLY THE HIGHLANDS
OTHERS ARE SAILING
CIRCLING THE ISLANDS
OTHERS ARE FLYING
LIFE WARD ALL HIEING
ALL FOR THE DISTANT
STAR OF EXISTENT
RAPTURE AND LOVE
MEPHISTOPHELES
HE SLEEPS ENOUGH YE FAYS YOUR AIRY NUMBER
HAVE SUNG HIM TRULY INTO SLUMBER
FOR THIS PERFORMANCE I YOUR DEBTOR PROVE
NOT YET ART THOU THE MAN TO CATCH THE FIEND AND HOLD HIM
WITH FAIREST IMAGES OF DREAMS INFOLD HIM
PLUNGE HIM IN SEAS OF SWEET UNTRUTH
YET FOR THE THRESHOLD'S MAGIC WHICH CONTROLLED HIM
THE DEVIL NEEDS A RAT'S QUICK TOOTH
I USE NO LENGTHENED INVOCATION
HERE RUSTLES ONE THAT SOON WILL WORK MY LIBERATION
THE LORD OF RATS AND EKE OF MICE
OF FLIES AND BED BUGS FROGS AND LICE
SUMMONS THEE HITHER TO THE DOOR SILL
TO GNAW IT WHERE WITH JUST A MORSEL
OF OIL HE PAINTS THE SPOT FOR THEE
THERE COM'ST THOU HOPPING ON TO ME
TO WORK AT ONCE THE POINT WHICH MADE ME CRAVEN
IS FORWARD ON THE LEDGE ENGRAVEN
ANOTHER BITE MAKES FREE THE DOOR
SO DREAM THY DREAMS O FAUST UNTIL WE MEET ONCE MORE
FAUST AWAKING
AM I AGAIN SO FOULLY CHEATED
REMAINS THERE NAUGHT OF LOFTY SPIRIT SWAY
BUT THAT A DREAM THE DEVIL COUNTERFEITED
AND THAT A POODLE RAN AWAY

LIFE BE AT LAST REVEALED TO THEE

TOO OLD AM I TO PLAY WITH PASSION
TOO YOUNG TO BE WITHOUT DESIRE
WHAT FROM THE WORLD HAVE I TO GAIN
THOU SHALT ABSTAIN RENOUNCE REFRAIN
SUCH IS THE EVERLASTING SONG
THAT IN THE EARS OF ALL MEN RINGS
THAT UNRELIEVED OUR WHOLE LIFE LONG
EACH HOUR IN PASSING HOARSELY SINGS
IN VERY TERROR I AT MORN AWAKE
UPON THE VERGE OF BITTER WEEPING
TO SEE THE DAY OF DISAPPOINTMENT BREAK
TO NO ONE HOPE OF MINE NOT ONE ITS PROMISE KEEPING
THAT EVEN EACH JOY'S PRESENTIMENT
WITH WILFUL CAVIL WOULD DIMINISH
WITH GRINNING MASKS OF LIFE PREVENT
MY MIND ITS FAIREST WORK TO FINISH
THEN TOO WHEN NIGHT DESCENDS HOW ANXIOUSLY
UPON MY COUCH OF SLEEP I LAY ME
THERE ALSO COMES NO REST TO ME
BUT SOME WILD DREAM IS SENT TO FRAY ME
THE GOD THAT IN MY BREAST IS OWNED
CAN DEEPLY STIR THE INNER SOURCES
THE GOD ABOVE MY POWERS ENTHRONED
HE CANNOT CHANGE EXTERNAL FORCES
SO BY THE BURDEN OF MY DAYS OPPRESSED
DEATH IS DESIRED AND LIFE A THING UNBLEST
MEPHISTOPHELES
AND YET IS NEVER DEATH A WHOLLY WELCOME GUEST
FAUST
O FORTUNATE FOR WHOM WHEN VICTORY GLANCES
THE BLOODY LAURELS ON THE BROW HE BINDETH
WHOM AFTER RAPID MADDENING DANCES
IN CLASPING MAIDEN ARMS HE FINDETH
O WOULD THAT I BEFORE THAT SPIRIT POWER
RAVISHED AND RAPT FROM LIFE HAD SUNKEN
MEPHISTOPHELES
AND YET BY SOME ONE IN THAT NIGHTLY HOUR
A CERTAIN LIQUID WAS NOT DRUNKEN
FAUST
EAVESDROPPING HA THY PLEASURE SEEMS TO BE
MEPHISTOPHELES
OMNISCIENT AM I NOT YET MUCH IS KNOWN TO ME
FAUST
THOUGH SOME FAMILIAR TONE RETRIEVING
MY THOUGHTS FROM TORMENT LED ME ON
AND SWEET CLEAR ECHOES CAME DECEIVING
A FAITH BEQUEATHED FROM CHILDHOOD'S DAWN
YET NOW I CURSE WHATE'ER ENTICES
AND SNARES THE SOUL WITH VISIONS VAIN
WITH DAZZLING CHEATS AND DEAR DEVICES
CONFINES IT IN THIS CAVE OF PAIN
CURSED BE AT ONCE THE HIGH AMBITION
WHEREWITH THE MIND ITSELF DELUDES
CURSED BE THE GLARE OF APPARITION
THAT ON THE FINER SENSE INTRUDES
CURSED BE THE LYING DREAM'S IMPRESSION
OF NAME AND FAME AND LAURELLED BROW
CURSED ALL THAT FLATTERS AS POSSESSION
AS WIFE AND CHILD AS KNAVE AND PLOW
CURSED MAMMON BE WHEN HE WITH TREASURES
TO RESTLESS ACTION SPURS OUR FATE
CURSED WHEN FOR SOFT INDULGENT LEISURES
HE LAYS FOR US THE PILLOWS STRAIGHT
CURSED BE THE VINE'S TRANSCENDENT NECTAR
THE HIGHEST FAVOR LOVE LETS FALL
CURSED ALSO HOPE CURSED FAITH THE SPECTRE
AND CURSED BE PATIENCE MOST OF ALL
CHORUS OF SPIRITS INVISIBLE
WOE WOE
THOU HAST IT DESTROYED
THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD
WITH POWERFUL FIST
IN RUIN 'TIS HURLED
BY THE BLOW OF A DEMIGOD SHATTERED
THE SCATTERED
FRAGMENTS INTO THE VOID WE CARRY
DEPLORING
THE BEAUTY PERISHED BEYOND RESTORING
MIGHTIER
FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
BRIGHTLIER
BUILD IT AGAIN
IN THINE OWN BOSOM BUILD IT ANEW
BID THE NEW CAREER
COMMENCE
WITH CLEARER SENSE
AND THE NEW SONGS OF CHEER
BE SUNG THERETO
MEPHISTOPHELES
THESE ARE THE SMALL DEPENDANTS
WHO GIVE ME ATTENDANCE
HEAR THEM TO DEEDS AND PASSION
COUNSEL IN SHREWD OLD FASHION
INTO THE WORLD OF STRIFE
OUT OF THIS LONELY LIFE
THAT OF SENSES AND SAP HAS BETRAYED THEE
THEY WOULD PERSUADE THEE
THIS NURSING OF THE PAIN FOREGO THEE
THAT LIKE A VULTURE FEEDS UPON THY BREAST
THE WORST SOCIETY THOU FIND'ST WILL SHOW THEE
THOU ART A MAN AMONG THE REST
BUT 'TIS NOT MEANT TO THRUST
THEE INTO THE MOB THOU HATEST
I AM NOT ONE OF THE GREATEST
YET WILT THOU TO ME ENTRUST
THY STEPS THROUGH LIFE I'LL GUIDE THEE
WILL WILLINGLY WALK BESIDE THEE
WILL SERVE THEE AT ONCE AND FOREVER
WITH BEST ENDEAVOR
AND IF THOU ART SATISFIED
WILL AS SERVANT SLAVE WITH THEE ABIDE
FAUST
AND WHAT SHALL BE MY COUNTER SERVICE THEREFOR
MEPHISTOPHELES
THE TIME IS LONG THOU NEED'ST NOT NOW INSIST
FAUST
NO NO THE DEVIL IS AN EGOTIST
AND IS NOT APT WITHOUT A WHY OR WHEREFORE
FOR GOD'S SAKE OTHERS TO ASSIST
SPEAK THY CONDITIONS PLAIN AND CLEAR
WITH SUCH A SERVANT DANGER COMES I FEAR
MEPHISTOPHELES
HERE AN UNWEARIED SLAVE I'LL WEAR THY TETHER
AND TO THINE EVERY NOD OBEDIENT BE
WHEN THERE AGAIN WE COME TOGETHER
THEN SHALT THOU DO THE SAME FOR ME
FAUST
THE THERE MY SCRUPLES NAUGHT INCREASES
WHEN THOU HAST DASHED THIS WORLD TO PIECES
THE OTHER THEN ITS PLACE MAY FILL
HERE ON THIS EARTH MY PLEASURES HAVE THEIR SOURCES
YON SUN BEHOLDS MY SORROWS IN HIS COURSES
AND WHEN FROM THESE MY LIFE ITSELF DIVORCES
LET HAPPEN ALL THAT CAN OR WILL
I'LL HEAR NO MORE 'TIS VAIN TO PONDER
IF THERE WE CHERISH LOVE OR HATE
OR IN THE SPHERES WE DREAM OF YONDER
A HIGH AND LOW OUR SOULS AWAIT
MEPHISTOPHELES
IN THIS SENSE EVEN CANST THOU VENTURE
COME BIND THYSELF BY PROMPT INDENTURE
AND THOU MINE ARTS WITH JOY SHALT SEE
WHAT NO MAN EVER SAW I'LL GIVE TO THEE
FAUST
CANST THOU POOR DEVIL GIVE ME WHATSOEVER
WHEN WAS A HUMAN SOUL IN ITS SUPREME ENDEAVOR
E'ER UNDERSTOOD BY SUCH AS THOU
YET HAST THOU FOOD WHICH NEVER SATIATES NOW
THE RESTLESS RUDDY GOLD HAST THOU
THAT RUNS QUICKSILVER LIKE ONE'S FINGERS THROUGH
A GAME WHOSE WINNINGS NO MAN EVER KNEW
A MAID THAT EVEN FROM MY BREAST
BECKONS MY NEIGHBOR WITH HER WANTON GLANCES
AND HONOR'S GODLIKE ZEST
THE METEOR THAT A MOMENT DANCES
SHOW ME THE FRUITS THAT ERE THEY'RE GATHERED ROT
AND TREES THAT DAILY WITH NEW LEAFAGE CLOTHE THEM
MEPHISTOPHELES
SUCH A DEMAND ALARMS ME NOT
SUCH TREASURES HAVE I AND CAN SHOW THEM
BUT STILL THE TIME MAY REACH US GOOD MY FRIEND
WHEN PEACE WE CRAVE AND MORE LUXURIOUS DIET
FAUST
WHEN ON AN IDLER'S BED I STRETCH MYSELF IN QUIET
THERE LET AT ONCE MY RECORD END
CANST THOU WITH LYING FLATTERY RULE ME
UNTIL SELF PLEASED MYSELF I SEE
CANST THOU WITH RICH ENJOYMENT FOOL ME
LET THAT DAY BE THE LAST FOR ME
THE BET I OFFER
MEPHISTOPHELES
DONE
FAUST
AND HEARTILY
WHEN THUS I HAIL THE MOMENT FLYING
AH STILL DELAY THOU ART SO FAIR
THEN BIND ME IN THY BONDS UNDYING
MY FINAL RUIN THEN DECLARE
THEN LET THE DEATH BELL CHIME THE TOKEN
THEN ART THOU FROM THY SERVICE FREE
THE CLOCK MAY STOP THE HAND BE BROKEN
THEN TIME BE FINISHED UNTO ME
MEPHISTOPHELES
CONSIDER WELL MY MEMORY GOOD IS RATED
FAUST
THOU HAST A PERFECT RIGHT THERETO
MY POWERS I HAVE NOT RASHLY ESTIMATED
A SLAVE AM I WHATE'ER I DO
IF THINE OR WHOSE 'TIS NEEDLESS TO DEBATE IT
MEPHISTOPHELES
THEN AT THE DOCTORS' BANQUET I TO DAY
WILL AS A SERVANT WAIT BEHIND THEE
BUT ONE THING MORE BEYOND ALL RISK TO BIND THEE
GIVE ME A LINE OR TWO I PRAY
FAUST
DEMAND'ST THOU PEDANT TOO A DOCUMENT
HAST NEVER KNOWN A MAN NOR PROVED HIS WORD'S INTENT
IS'T NOT ENOUGH THAT WHAT I SPEAK TO DAY
SHALL STAND WITH ALL MY FUTURE DAYS AGREEING
IN ALL ITS TIDES SWEEPS NOT THE WORLD AWAY
AND SHALL A PROMISE BIND MY BEING
YET THIS DELUSION IN OUR HEARTS WE BEAR
WHO WOULD HIMSELF THEREFROM DELIVER
BLEST HE WHOSE BOSOM TRUTH MAKES PURE AND FAIR
NO SACRIFICE SHALL HE REPENT OF EVER
NATHLESS A PARCHMENT WRIT AND STAMPED WITH CARE
A SPECTRE IS WHICH ALL TO SHUN ENDEAVOR
THE WORD ALAS DIES EVEN IN THE PEN
AND WAX AND LEATHER KEEP THE LORDSHIP THEN
WHAT WILT FROM ME BASE SPIRIT SAY
BRASS MARBLE PARCHMENT PAPER CLAY
THE TERMS WITH GRAVER QUILL OR CHISEL STATED
I FREELY LEAVE THE CHOICE TO THEE
MEPHISTOPHELES
WHY HEAT THYSELF THUS INSTANTLY
WITH ELOQUENCE EXAGGERATED
EACH LEAF FOR SUCH A PACT IS GOOD
AND TO SUBSCRIBE THY NAME THOU'LT TAKE A DROP OF BLOOD
FAUST
IF THOU THEREWITH ART FULLY SATISFIED
SO LET US BY THE FARCE ABIDE
MEPHISTOPHELES
BLOOD IS A JUICE OF RAREST QUALITY
FAUST
FEAR NOT THAT I THIS PACT SHALL SEEK TO SEVER
THE PROMISE THAT I MAKE TO THEE
IS JUST THE SUM OF MY ENDEAVOR
I HAVE MYSELF INFLATED ALL TOO HIGH
MY PROPER PLACE IS THY ESTATE
THE MIGHTY SPIRIT DEIGNS ME NO REPLY
AND NATURE SHUTS ON ME HER GATE
THE THREAD OF THOUGHT AT LAST IS BROKEN
AND KNOWLEDGE BRINGS DISGUST UNSPOKEN
LET US THE SENSUAL DEEPS EXPLORE
TO QUENCH THE FERVORS OF GLOWING PASSION
LET EVERY MARVEL TAKE FORM AND FASHION
THROUGH THE IMPERVIOUS VEIL IT WORE
PLUNGE WE IN TIME'S TUMULTUOUS DANCE
IN THE RUSH AND ROLL OF CIRCUMSTANCE
THEN MAY DELIGHT AND DISTRESS
AND WORRY AND SUCCESS
ALTERNATELY FOLLOW AS BEST THEY CAN
RESTLESS ACTIVITY PROVES THE MAN
MEPHISTOPHELES
FOR YOU NO BOUND NO TERM IS SET
WHETHER YOU EVERYWHERE BE TRYING
OR SNATCH A RAPID BLISS IN FLYING
MAY IT AGREE WITH YOU WHAT YOU GET
ONLY FALL TO AND SHOW NO TIMID BALKING
FAUST
BUT THOU HAST HEARD 'TIS NOT OF JOY WE'RE TALKING
I TAKE THE WILDERING WHIRL ENJOYMENT'S KEENEST PAIN
ENAMORED HATE EXHILARANT DISDAIN
MY BOSOM OF ITS THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE SATED
SHALL NOT HENCEFORTH FROM ANY PANG BE WRESTED
AND ALL OF LIFE FOR ALL MANKIND CREATED
SHALL BE WITHIN MINE INMOST BEING TESTED
THE HIGHEST LOWEST FORMS MY SOUL SHALL BORROW
SHALL HEAP UPON ITSELF THEIR BLISS AND SORROW
AND THUS MY OWN SOLE SELF TO ALL THEIR SELVES EXPANDED
I TOO AT LAST SHALL WITH THEM ALL BE STRANDED
MEPHISTOPHELES
BELIEVE ME WHO FOR MANY A THOUSAND YEAR
THE SAME TOUGH MEAT HAVE CHEWED AND TESTED
THAT FROM THE CRADLE TO THE BIER
NO MAN THE ANCIENT LEAVEN HAS DIGESTED
TRUST ONE OF US THIS WHOLE SUPERNAL
IS MADE BUT FOR A GOD'S DELIGHT
HE DWELLS IN SPLENDOR SINGLE AND ETERNAL
BUT US HE THRUSTS IN DARKNESS OUT OF SIGHT
AND YOU HE DOWERS WITH DAY AND NIGHT
FAUST
NAY BUT I WILL
MEPHISTOPHELES
A GOOD REPLY
ONE ONLY FEAR STILL NEEDS REPEATING
THE ART IS LONG THE TIME IS FLEETING
THEN LET THYSELF BE TAUGHT SAY I
GO LEAGUE THYSELF WITH A POET
GIVE THE REIN TO HIS IMAGINATION
THEN WEAR THE CROWN AND SHOW IT
OF THE QUALITIES OF HIS CREATION
THE COURAGE OF THE LION'S BREED
THE WILD STAG'S SPEED
THE ITALIAN'S FIERY BLOOD
THE NORTH'S FIRM FORTITUDE
LET HIM FIND FOR THEE THE SECRET TETHER
THAT BINDS THE NOBLE AND MEAN TOGETHER
AND TEACH THY PULSES OF YOUTH AND PLEASURE
TO LOVE BY RULE AND HATE BY MEASURE
I'D LIKE MYSELF SUCH A ONE TO SEE
SIR MICROCOSM HIS NAME SHOULD BE
FAUST
WHAT AM I THEN IF 'TIS DENIED MY PART
THE CROWN OF ALL HUMANITY TO WIN ME
WHERETO YEARNS EVERY SENSE WITHIN ME
MEPHISTOPHELES
WHY ON THE WHOLE THOU'RT WHAT THOU ART
SET WIGS OF MILLION CURLS UPON THY HEAD TO RAISE THEE
WEAR SHOES AN ELL IN HEIGHT THE TRUTH BETRAYS THEE
AND THOU REMAINEST WHAT THOU ART
FAUST
I FEEL INDEED THAT I HAVE MADE THE TREASURE
OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND KNOWLEDGE MINE IN VAIN
AND IF I NOW SIT DOWN IN RESTFUL LEISURE
NO FOUNT OF NEWER STRENGTH IS IN MY BRAIN
I AM NO HAIR'S BREADTH MORE IN HEIGHT
NOR NEARER TO THE INFINITE
MEPHISTOPHELES
GOOD SIR YOU SEE THE FACTS PRECISELY
AS THEY ARE SEEN BY EACH AND ALL
WE MUST ARRANGE THEM NOW MORE WISELY
BEFORE THE JOYS OF LIFE SHALL PALL
WHY ZOUNDS BOTH HANDS AND FEET ARE TRULY
AND HEAD AND VIRILE FORCES THINE
YET ALL THAT I INDULGE IN NEWLY
IS'T THENCE LESS WHOLLY MINE
IF I'VE SIX STALLIONS IN MY STALL
ARE NOT THEIR FORCES ALSO LENT ME
I SPEED ALONG COMPLETEST MAN OF ALL
AS THOUGH MY LEGS WERE FOUR AND TWENTY
TAKE HOLD THEN LET REFLECTION REST
AND PLUNGE INTO THE WORLD WITH ZEST
I SAY TO THEE A SPECULATIVE WIGHT
IS LIKE A BEAST ON MOORLANDS LEAN
THAT ROUND AND ROUND SOME FIEND MISLEADS TO EVIL PLIGHT
WHILE ALL ABOUT LIE PASTURES FRESH AND GREEN
FAUST
THEN HOW SHALL WE BEGIN
MEPHISTOPHELES
WE'LL TRY A WIDER SPHERE
WHAT PLACE OF MARTYRDOM IS HERE
IS'T LIFE I ASK IS'T EVEN PRUDENCE
TO BORE THYSELF AND BORE THE STUDENTS
LET NEIGHBOR PAUNCH TO THAT ATTEND
WHY PLAGUE THYSELF WITH THRESHING STRAW FOREVER
THE BEST THOU LEARNEST IN THE END
THOU DAR'ST NOT TELL THE YOUNGSTERS NEVER
I HEAR ONE'S FOOTSTEPS HITHER STEERING
FAUST
TO SEE HIM NOW I HAVE NO HEART
MEPHISTOPHELES
SO LONG THE POOR BOY WAITS A HEARING
HE MUST NOT UNCONSOLED DEPART
THY CAP AND MANTLE STRAIGHTWAY LEND ME
I'LL PLAY THE COMEDY WITH ART
HE DISGUISES HIMSELF
MY WITS BE CERTAIN WILL BEFRIEND ME
BUT FIFTEEN MINUTES' TIME IS ALL I NEED
FOR OUR FINE TRIP MEANWHILE PREPARE THYSELF WITH SPEED
EXIT FAUST
MEPHISTOPHELES
IN FAUST'S LONG MANTLE
REASON AND KNOWLEDGE ONLY THOU DESPISE
THE HIGHEST STRENGTH IN MAN THAT LIES
LET BUT THE LYING SPIRIT BIND THEE
WITH MAGIC WORKS AND SHOWS THAT BLIND THEE
AND I SHALL HAVE THEE FAST AND SURE
FATE SUCH A BOLD UNTRAMMELLED SPIRIT GAVE HIM
AS FORWARDS ONWARDS EVER MUST ENDURE
WHOSE OVER HASTY IMPULSE DRAVE HIM
PAST EARTHLY JOYS HE MIGHT SECURE
DRAGGED THROUGH THE WILDEST LIFE WILL I ENSLAVE HIM
THROUGH FLAT AND STALE INDIFFERENCE
WITH STRUGGLING CHILLING CHECKING SO DEPRAVE HIM
THAT TO HIS HOT INSATIATE SENSE
THE DREAM OF DRINK SHALL MOCK BUT NEVER LAVE HIM
REFRESHMENT SHALL HIS LIPS IN VAIN IMPLORE
HAD HE NOT MADE HIMSELF THE DEVIL'S NAUGHT COULD SAVE
HIM
STILL WERE HE LOST FOREVERMORE
A STUDENT ENTERS
STUDENT
A SHORT TIME ONLY AM I HERE
AND COME DEVOTED AND SINCERE
TO GREET AND KNOW THE MAN OF FAME
WHOM MEN TO ME WITH REVERENCE NAME
MEPHISTOPHELES
YOUR COURTESY DOTH FLATTER ME
YOU SEE A MAN AS OTHERS BE
HAVE YOU PERCHANCE ELSEWHERE BEGUN
STUDENT
RECEIVE ME NOW I PRAY AS ONE
WHO COMES TO YOU WITH COURAGE GOOD
SOMEWHAT OF CASH AND HEALTHY BLOOD
MY MOTHER WAS HARDLY WILLING TO LET ME
BUT KNOWLEDGE WORTH HAVING I FAIN WOULD GET ME
MEPHISTOPHELES
THEN YOU HAVE REACHED THE RIGHT PLACE NOW
STUDENT
I'D LIKE TO LEAVE IT I MUST AVOW
I FIND THESE WALLS THESE VAULTED SPACES
ARE ANYTHING BUT PLEASANT PLACES
TIS ALL SO CRAMPED AND CLOSE AND MEAN
ONE SEES NO TREE NO GLIMPSE OF GREEN
AND WHEN THE LECTURE HALLS RECEIVE ME
SEEING HEARING AND THINKING LEAVE ME
MEPHISTOPHELES
ALL THAT DEPENDS ON HABITUDE
SO FROM ITS MOTHER'S BREASTS A CHILD
AT FIRST RELUCTANT TAKES ITS FOOD
BUT SOON TO SEEK THEM IS BEGUILED
THUS AT THE BREASTS OF WISDOM CLINGING
THOU'LT FIND EACH DAY A GREATER RAPTURE BRINGING
STUDENT
I'LL HANG THEREON WITH JOY AND FREELY DRAIN THEM
BUT TELL ME PRAY THE PROPER MEANS TO GAIN THEM
MEPHISTOPHELES
EXPLAIN BEFORE YOU FURTHER SPEAK
THE SPECIAL FACULTY YOU SEEK
STUDENT
I CRAVE THE HIGHEST ERUDITION
AND FAIN WOULD MAKE MY ACQUISITION
ALL THAT THERE IS IN EARTH AND HEAVEN
IN NATURE AND IN SCIENCE TOO
MEPHISTOPHELES
HERE IS THE GENUINE PATH FOR YOU
YET STRICT ATTENTION MUST BE GIVEN
STUDENT
BODY AND SOUL THEREON I'LL WREAK
YET TRULY I'VE SOME INCLINATION
ON SUMMER HOLIDAYS TO SEEK
A LITTLE FREEDOM AND RECREATION
MEPHISTOPHELES
USE WELL YOUR TIME IT FLIES SO SWIFTLY FROM US
BUT TIME THROUGH ORDER MAY BE WON I PROMISE
SO FRIEND MY VIEWS TO BRIEFLY SUM
FIRST THE COLLEGIUM LOGICUM
THERE WILL YOUR MIND BE DRILLED AND BRACED
AS IF IN SPANISH BOOTS 'TWERE LACED
AND THUS TO GRAVER PACES BROUGHT
'TWILL PLOD ALONG THE PATH OF THOUGHT
INSTEAD OF SHOOTING HERE AND THERE
A WILL O' THE WISP IN MURKY AIR
DAYS WILL BE SPENT TO BID YOU KNOW
WHAT ONCE YOU DID AT A SINGLE BLOW
LIKE EATING AND DRINKING FREE AND STRONG
THAT ONE TWO THREE THERETO BELONG
TRULY THE FABRIC OF MENTAL FLEECE
RESEMBLES A WEAVER'S MASTERPIECE
WHERE A THOUSAND THREADS ONE TREADLE THROWS
WHERE FLY THE SHUTTLES HITHER AND THITHER
UNSEEN THE THREADS ARE KNIT TOGETHER
AND AN INFINITE COMBINATION GROWS
THEN THE PHILOSOPHER STEPS IN
AND SHOWS NO OTHERWISE IT COULD HAVE BEEN
THE FIRST WAS SO THE SECOND SO
THEREFORE THE THIRD AND FOURTH ARE SO
WERE NOT THE FIRST AND SECOND THEN
THE THIRD AND FOURTH HAD NEVER BEEN
THE SCHOLARS ARE EVERYWHERE BELIEVERS
BUT NEVER SUCCEED IN BEING WEAVERS
HE WHO WOULD STUDY ORGANIC EXISTENCE
FIRST DRIVES OUT THE SOUL WITH RIGID PERSISTENCE
THEN THE PARTS IN HIS HAND HE MAY HOLD AND CLASS
BUT THE SPIRITUAL LINK IS LOST ALAS
ENCHEIRESIN NATURES THIS CHEMISTRY NAMES
NOR KNOWS HOW HERSELF SHE BANTERS AND BLAMES
STUDENT
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU QUITE
MEPHISTOPHELES
YOUR MIND WILL SHORTLY BE SET ARIGHT
WHEN YOU HAVE LEARNED ALL THINGS REDUCING
TO CLASSIFY THEM FOR YOUR USING
STUDENT
I FEEL AS STUPID FROM ALL YOU'VE SAID
AS IF A MILL WHEEL WHIRLED IN MY HEAD
MEPHISTOPHELES
AND AFTER FIRST AND FOREMOST DUTY OF
METAPHYSICS LEARN THE USE AND BEAUTY
SEE THAT YOU MOST PROFOUNDLY GAIN
WHAT DOES NOT SUIT THE HUMAN BRAIN
A SPLENDID WORD TO SERVE YOU'LL FIND
FOR WHAT GOES IN OR WON'T GO IN YOUR MIND
BUT FIRST AT LEAST THIS HALF A YEAR
TO ORDER RIGIDLY ADHERE
FIVE HOURS A DAY YOU UNDERSTAND
AND WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES BE ON HAND
PREPARE BEFOREHAND FOR YOUR PART
WITH PARAGRAPHS ALL GOT BY HEART
SO YOU CAN BETTER WATCH AND LOOK
THAT NAUGHT IS SAID BUT WHAT IS IN THE BOOK
YET IN THY WRITING AS UNWEARIED BE
AS DID THE HOLY GHOST DICTATE TO THEE
STUDENT
NO NEED TO TELL ME TWICE TO DO IT
I THINK HOW USEFUL 'TIS TO WRITE
FOR WHAT ONE HAS IN BLACK AND WHITE
ONE CARRIES HOME AND THEN GOES THROUGH IT
MEPHISTOPHELES
YET CHOOSE THYSELF A FACULTY
STUDENT
I CANNOT RECONCILE MYSELF TO JURISPRUDENCE
MEPHISTOPHELES
NOR CAN I THEREFORE GREATLY BLAME YOU STUDENTS
I KNOW WHAT SCIENCE THIS HAS COME TO BE
ALL RIGHTS AND LAWS ARE STILL TRANSMITTED
LIKE AN ETERNAL SICKNESS OF THE RACE
FROM GENERATION UNTO GENERATION FITTED
AND SHIFTED ROUND FROM PLACE TO PLACE
REASON BECOMES A SHAM BENEFICENCE A WORRY
THOU ART A GRANDCHILD THEREFORE WOE TO THEE
THE RIGHT BORN WITH US OURS IN VERITY
THIS TO CONSIDER THERE'S ALAS NO HURRY
STUDENT
MY OWN DISGUST IS STRENGTHENED BY YOUR SPEECH
O LUCKY HE WHOM YOU SHALL TEACH
I'VE ALMOST FOR THEOLOGY DECIDED
MEPHISTOPHELES
I SHOULD NOT WISH TO SEE YOU HERE MISGUIDED
FOR AS REGARDS THIS SCIENCE LET ME HINT
'TIS VERY HARD TO SHUN THE FALSE DIRECTION
THERE'S SO MUCH SECRET POISON LURKING IN 'T
SO LIKE THE MEDICINE IT BAFFLES YOUR DETECTION
HEAR THEREFORE ONE ALONE FOR THAT IS BEST IN SOOTH
AND SIMPLY TAKE YOUR MASTER'S WORDS FOR TRUTH
ON WORDS LET YOUR ATTENTION CENTRE
THEN THROUGH THE SAFEST GATE YOU'LL ENTER
THE TEMPLE HALLS OF CERTAINTY
STUDENT
YET IN THE WORD MUST SOME IDEA BE
MEPHISTOPHELES
OF COURSE BUT ONLY SHUN TOO OVER SHARP A TENSION
FOR JUST WHERE FAILS THE COMPREHENSION
A WORD STEPS PROMPTLY IN AS DEPUTY
WITH WORDS 'TIS EXCELLENT DISPUTING
SYSTEMS TO WORDS 'TIS EASY SUITING
ON WORDS 'TIS EXCELLENT BELIEVING
NO WORD CAN EVER LOSE A JOT FROM THIEVING
STUDENT
PARDON WITH MANY QUESTIONS I DETAIN YOU
YET MUST I TROUBLE YOU AGAIN
OF MEDICINE I STILL WOULD FAIN
HEAR ONE STRONG WORD THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN YOU
THREE YEARS IS BUT A LITTLE SPACE
AND GOD WHO CAN THE FIELD EMBRACE
IF ONE SOME INDEX COULD BE SHOWN
'TWERE EASIER GROPING FORWARD TRULY
MEPHISTOPHELES ASIDE
I'M TIRED ENOUGH OF THIS DRY TONE
MUST PLAY THE DEVIL AGAIN AND FULLY
ALOUD
TO GRASP THE SPIRIT OF MEDICINE IS EASY
LEARN OF THE GREAT AND LITTLE WORLD YOUR FILL
TO LET IT GO AT LAST SO PLEASE YE
JUST AS GOD WILL
IN VAIN THAT THROUGH THE REALMS OF SCIENCE YOU MAY DRIFT
EACH ONE LEARNS ONLY JUST WHAT LEARN HE CAN
YET HE WHO GRASPS THE MOMENT'S GIFT
HE IS THE PROPER MAN
WELL MADE YOU ARE 'TIS NOT TO BE DENIED
THE REST A BOLD ADDRESS WILL WIN YOU
IF YOU BUT IN YOURSELF CONFIDE
AT ONCE CONFIDE ALL OTHERS IN YOU
TO LEAD THE WOMEN LEARN THE SPECIAL FEELING
THEIR EVERLASTING ACHES AND GROANS
IN THOUSAND TONES
HAVE ALL ONE SOURCE ONE MODE OF HEALING
AND IF YOUR ACTS ARE HALF DISCREET
YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE THEM AT YOUR FEET
A TITLE FIRST MUST DRAW AND INTEREST THEM
AND SHOW THAT YOURS ALL OTHER ARTS EXCEEDS
THEN AS A GREETING YOU ARE FREE TO TOUCH AND TEST THEM
WHILE THUS TO DO FOR YEARS ANOTHER PLEADS
YOU PRESS AND COUNT THE PULSE'S DANCES
AND THEN WITH BURNING SIDELONG GLANCES
YOU CLASP THE SWELLING HIPS TO SEE
IF TIGHTLY LACED HER CORSETS BE
STUDENT
THAT'S BETTER NOW THE HOW AND WHERE ONE SEES
MEPHISTOPHELES
MY WORTHY FRIEND GRAY ARE ALL THEORIES
AND GREEN ALONE LIFE'S GOLDEN TREE
STUDENT
I SWEAR TO YOU 'TIS LIKE A DREAM TO ME
MIGHT I AGAIN PRESUME WITH TRUST UNBOUNDED
TO HEAR YOUR WISDOM THOROUGHLY EXPOUNDED
MEPHISTOPHELES
MOST WILLINGLY TO WHAT EXTENT I MAY
STUDENT
I CANNOT REALLY GO AWAY
ALLOW ME THAT MY ALBUM FIRST I REACH YOU
GRANT ME THIS FAVOR I BESEECH YOU
MEPHISTOPHELES

SHALT THOU SPONGE THROUGH THE TERM BEGINNING
FAUST
YET WITH THE FLOWING BEARD I WEAR
BOTH EASE AND GRACE WILL FAIL ME THERE
THE ATTEMPT INDEED WERE A FUTILE STRIFE
I NEVER COULD LEARN THE WAYS OF LIFE
I FEEL SO SMALL BEFORE OTHERS AND THENCE
SHOULD ALWAYS FIND EMBARRASSMENTS
MEPHISTOPHELES
MY FRIEND THOU SOON SHALT LOSE ALL SUCH MISGIVING
BE THOU BUT SELF POSSESSED THOU HAST THE ART OF LIVING
FAUST
HOW SHALL WE LEAVE THE HOUSE AND START
WHERE HAST THOU SERVANT COACH AND HORSES
MEPHISTOPHELES
WE'LL SPREAD THIS CLOAK WITH PROPER ART
THEN THROUGH THE AIR DIRECT OUR COURSES
BUT ONLY ON SO BOLD A FLIGHT
BE SURE TO HAVE THY LUGGAGE LIGHT
A LITTLE BURNING AIR WHICH I SHALL SOON PREPARE US

AT OUR LAST INTERVIEW BEFORE WE PARTED
MUCH OF HIS COUSINS DID HE SPEAK ENTREATING
THAT WE SHOULD GIVE TO EACH HIS KINDLY GREETING
HE BOWS TO FROSCH
ALTMAYER ASIDE
YOU HAVE IT NOW HE UNDERSTANDS
SIEBEL
A KNAVE SHARP SET
FROSCH
JUST WAIT AWHILE I'LL HAVE HIM YET
MEPHISTOPHELES

OF WELL TRAINED VOICES SINGING CHORUS
AND TRULY SONG MUST HERE REBOUND
SUPERBLY FROM THE ARCHES O'ER US
FROSCH

MEPHISTOPHELES
O NO MY WISH IS GREAT MY POWER IS ONLY SO SO
ALTMAYER

MEPHISTOPHELES
IF YOU DESIRE A NUMBER
SIEBEL
SO THAT IT BE A BRAN NEW STRAIN
MEPHISTOPHELES
WE'VE JUST RETRACED OUR WAY FROM
SPAIN
THE LOVELY LAND OF WINE AND SONG AND SLUMBER
SINGS
THERE WAS A KING ONCE REIGNING
WHO HAD A BIG BLACK FLEA
FROSCH
HEAR HEAR A FLEA D'YE RIGHTLY TAKE THE JEST
I CALL A FLEA A TIDY GUEST
MEPHISTOPHELES SINGS
THERE WAS A KING ONCE REIGNING
WHO HAD A BIG BLACK FLEA
AND LOVED HIM PAST EXPLAINING
AS HIS OWN SON WERE HE
HE CALLED HIS MAN OF STITCHES
THE TAILOR CAME STRAIGHTWAY
HERE MEASURE THE LAD FOR BREECHES
AND MEASURE HIS COAT I SAY
BRANDER
BUT MIND ALLOW THE TAILOR NO CAPRICES
ENJOIN UPON HIM AS HIS HEAD IS DEAR
TO MOST EXACTLY MEASURE SEW AND SHEAR
SO THAT THE BREECHES HAVE NO CREASES
MEPHISTOPHELES
IN SILK AND VELVET GLEAMING
HE NOW WAS WHOLLY DREST
HAD A COAT WITH RIBBONS STREAMING
A CROSS UPON HIS BREAST
HE HAD THE FIRST OF STATIONS
A MINISTER'S STAR AND NAME
AND ALSO ALL HIS RELATIONS
GREAT LORDS AT COURT BECAME
AND THE LORDS AND LADIES OF HONOR
WERE PLAGUED AWAKE AND IN BED
THE QUEEN SHE GOT THEM UPON HER
THE MAIDS WERE BITTEN AND BLED
AND THEY DID NOT DARE TO BRUSH THEM
OR SCRATCH THEM DAY OR NIGHT
WE CRACK THEM AND WE CRUSH THEM
AT ONCE WHENE'ER THEY BITE
CHORUS SHOUTING
WE CRACK THEM AND WE CRUSH THEM
AT ONCE WHENE'ER THEY BITE
FROSCH
BRAVO BRAVO THAT WAS FINE
SIEBEL
EVERY FLEA MAY IT SO BEFALL
BRANDER
POINT YOUR FINGERS AND NIP THEM ALL
ALTMAYER

MEPHISTOPHELES

MEPHISTOPHELES
DID I NOT FEAR THE LANDLORD MIGHT COMPLAIN

SIEBEL

FROSCH

MEPHISTOPHELES

WITCHES' KITCHEN
UPON A LOW HEARTH STANDS A GREAT CALDRON UNDER WHICH A FIRE
IS BURNING
VARIOUS FIGURES APPEAR IN THE VAPORS WHICH
RISE FROM THE CALDRON
AN APE SITS BESIDE IT SKIMS IT AND
WATCHES LEST IT BOIL OVER
THE HE APE WITH THE YOUNG
ONES SITS NEAR AND WARMS HIMSELF
CEILING AND WALLS ARE
COVERED WITH THE MOST FANTASTIC WITCH IMPLEMENTS
FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES
FAUST
THESE CRAZY SIGNS OF WITCHES' CRAFT REPEL ME
I SHALL RECOVER DOST THOU TELL ME
THROUGH THIS INSANE CHAOTIC PLAY
FROM AN OLD HAG SHALL I DEMAND ASSISTANCE
AND WILL HER FOUL MESS TAKE AWAY
FULL THIRTY YEARS FROM MY EXISTENCE
WOE'S ME CANST THOU NAUGHT BETTER FIND
ANOTHER BAFFLED HOPE MUST BE LAMENTED
HAS NATURE THEN AND HAS A NOBLE MIND
NOT ANY POTENT BALSAM YET INVENTED
MEPHISTOPHELES
ONCE MORE MY FRIEND THOU TALKEST SENSIBLY
THERE IS TO MAKE THEE YOUNG A SIMPLER MODE AND APTER
BUT IN ANOTHER BOOK 'TIS WRIT FOR THEE
AND IS A MOST ECCENTRIC CHAPTER
FAUST
YET WILL I KNOW IT
MEPHISTOPHELES
GOOD THE METHOD IS REVEALED
WITHOUT OR GOLD OR MAGIC OR PHYSICIAN
BETAKE THYSELF TO YONDER FIELD
THERE HOE AND DIG AS THY CONDITION
RESTRAIN THYSELF THY SENSE AND WILL
WITHIN A NARROW SPHERE TO FLOURISH
WITH UNMIXED FOOD THY BODY NOURISH
LIVE WITH THE OX AS OX AND THINK IT NOT A THEFT
THAT THOU MANUR'ST THE ACRE WHICH THOU REAPEST
THAT TRUST ME IS THE BEST MODE LEFT
WHEREBY FOR EIGHTY YEARS THY YOUTH THOU KEEPEST
FAUST
I AM NOT USED TO THAT I CANNOT STOOP TO TRY IT
TO TAKE THE SPADE IN HAND AND PLY IT
THE NARROW BEING SUITS ME NOT AT ALL
MEPHISTOPHELES
THEN TO THINE AID THE WITCH MUST CALL
FAUST
WHEREFORE THE HAG AND HER ALONE
CANST THOU THYSELF NOT BREW THE POTION
MEPHISTOPHELES
THAT WERE A CHARMING SPORT I OWN
I'D BUILD A THOUSAND BRIDGES MEANWHILE I'VE A NOTION
NOT ART AND SCIENCE SERVE ALONE
PATIENCE MUST IN THE WORK BE SHOWN
LONG IS THE CALM BRAIN ACTIVE IN CREATION
TIME ONLY STRENGTHENS THE FINE FERMENTATION
AND ALL BELONGING THEREUNTO
IS RARE AND STRANGE HOWE'ER YOU TAKE IT
THE DEVIL TAUGHT THE THING 'TIS TRUE
AND YET THE DEVIL CANNOT MAKE IT
PERCEIVING THE ANIMALS
SEE WHAT A DELICATE RACE THEY BE
THAT IS THE MAID THE MAN IS HE
TO THE ANIMALS
IT SEEMS THE MISTRESS HAS GONE AWAY
THE ANIMALS
CAROUSING TO DAY
OFF AND ABOUT
BY THE CHIMNEY OUT
MEPHISTOPHELES
WHAT TIME TAKES SHE FOR DISSIPATING
THE ANIMALS
WHILE WE TO WARM OUR PAWS ARE WAITING
MEPHISTOPHELES TO FAUST
HOW FINDEST THOU THE TENDER CREATURES
FAUST
ABSURDER THAN I EVER YET DID SEE
MEPHISTOPHELES
WHY JUST SUCH TALK AS THIS FOR ME
IS THAT WHICH HAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE FEATURES
TO THE ANIMALS
BUT TELL ME NOW YE CURSED PUPPETS
WHY DO YE STIR THE PORRIDGE SO
THE ANIMALS
WE'RE COOKING WATERY SOUP FOR BEGGARS
MEPHISTOPHELES
THEN A GREAT PUBLIC YOU CAN SHOW
THE HE APE
COMES UP AND FAWNS ON MEPHISTOPHELES
O CAST THOU THE DICE
MAKE ME RICH IN A TRICE
LET ME WIN IN GOOD SEASON
THINGS ARE BADLY CONTROLLED
AND HAD I BUT GOLD
SO HAD I MY REASON
MEPHISTOPHELES
HOW WOULD THE APE BE SURE HIS LUCK ENHANCES
COULD HE BUT TRY THE LOTTERY'S CHANCES
IN THE MEANTIME THE YOUNG APES HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH A
LARGE BALL WHICH THEY NOW ROLL FORWARD
THE HE APE
THE WORLD'S THE BALL
DOTH RISE AND FALL
AND ROLL INCESSANT
LIKE GLASS DOTH RING
A HOLLOW THING
HOW SOON WILL'T SPRING
AND DROP QUIESCENT
HERE BRIGHT IT GLEAMS
HERE BRIGHTER SEEMS
I LIVE AT PRESENT
DEAR SON I SAY
KEEP THOU AWAY
THY DOOM IS SPOKEN
'TIS MADE OF CLAY
AND WILL BE BROKEN
MEPHISTOPHELES
WHAT MEANS THE SIEVE
THE HE APE TAKING IT DOWN
WERT THOU THE THIEF
I'D KNOW HIM AND SHAME HIM
HE RUNS TO THE SHE APE AND LETS HER LOOK THROUGH IT
LOOK THROUGH THE SIEVE
KNOW'ST THOU THE THIEF
AND DAREST NOT NAME HIM
MEPHISTOPHELES APPROACHING THE FIRE
AND WHAT'S THIS POT
HE APE AND SHE APE
THE FOOL KNOWS IT NOT
HE KNOWS NOT THE POT
HE KNOWS NOT THE KETTLE
MEPHISTOPHELES
IMPERTINENT BEAST
THE HE APE
TAKE THE BRUSH HERE AT LEAST
AND SIT DOWN ON THE SETTLE
HE INVITES MEPHISTOPHELES TO SIT DOWN
FAUST
WHO DURING ALL THIS TIME HAS BEEN STANDING BEFORE A MIRROR
NOW APPROACHING AND NOW RETREATING FROM IT
WHAT DO I SEE WHAT HEAVENLY FORM REVEALED
SHOWS THROUGH THE GLASS FROM MAGIC'S FAIR DOMINIONS
O LEND ME LOVE THE SWIFTEST OF THY PINIONS
AND BEAR ME TO HER BEAUTEOUS FIELD
AH IF I LEAVE THIS SPOT WITH FOND DESIGNING
IF I ATTEMPT TO VENTURE NEAR
DIM AS THROUGH GATHERING MIST HER CHARMS APPEAR
A WOMAN'S FORM IN BEAUTY SHINING
CAN WOMAN THEN SO LOVELY BE
AND MUST I FIND HER BODY THERE RECLINING
OF ALL THE HEAVENS THE BRIGHT EPITOME
CAN EARTH WITH SUCH A THING BE MATED
MEPHISTOPHELES
WHY SURELY IF A GOD FIRST PLAGUES HIMSELF SIX DAYS
THEN SELF CONTENTED BRAVO SAYS
MUST SOMETHING CLEVER BE CREATED
THIS TIME THINE EYES BE SATIATE
I'LL YET DETECT THY SWEETHEART AND ENSNARE HER
AND BLEST IS HE WHO HAS THE LUCKY FATE
SOME DAY AS BRIDEGROOM HOME TO BEAR HER
FAUST GAZES CONTINUALLY IN THE MIRROR
MEPHISTOPHELES
STRETCHING HIMSELF OUT ON THE SETTLE AND PLAYING WITH THE
BRUSH CONTINUES TO SPEAK
SO SIT I LIKE THE KING UPON HIS THRONE
I HOLD THE SCEPTRE HERE AND LACK THE CROWN ALONE
THE ANIMALS
WHO UP TO THIS TIME HAVE BEEN MAKING ALL KINDS OF FANTASTIC
MOVEMENTS TOGETHER BRING A CROWN TO MEPHISTOPHELES
WITH GREAT NOISE
O BE THOU SO GOOD
WITH SWEAT AND WITH BLOOD
THE CROWN TO BELIME
THEY HANDLE THE CROWN AWKWARDLY AND BREAK IT INTO TWO
PIECES WITH WHICH THEY SPRING AROUND
'TIS DONE LET IT BE
WE SPEAK AND WE SEE
WE HEAR AND WE RHYME
FAUST BEFORE THE MIRROR
WOE'S ME I FEAR TO LOSE MY WITS
MEPHISTOPHELES POINTING TO THE ANIMALS

'TIS THOUGHTS AND WE'RE THINKING
FAUST AS ABOVE
MY BOSOM BURNS WITH THAT SWEET VISION
LET US WITH SPEED AWAY FROM HERE
MEPHISTOPHELES IN THE SAME ATTITUDE

THEY'RE POETS GENUINE AND SINCERE
THE CALDRON WHICH THE SHE APE HAS UP TO THIS TIME NEGLECTED
TO WATCH BEGINS TO BOIL OVER THERE ENSUES A GREAT FLAME
WHICH BLAZES OUT THE CHIMNEY
THE WITCH COMES CAREERING
DOWN THROUGH THE FLAME WITH TERRIBLE CRIES

FLAMES TOWARDS FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES AND THE ANIMALS
THE ANIMALS WHIMPER
MEPHISTOPHELES
REVERSING THE BRUSH WHICH HE HAS BEEN HOLDING IN HIS HAND
AND STRIDING AMONG THE JARS AND GLASSES
IN TWO IN TWO

AS THE WITCH STARTS BACK FULL OF WRATH AND HORROR
HA KNOW'ST THOU ME ABOMINATION THOU

MEPHISTOPHELES
THIS TIME I'LL LET THEE 'SCAPE THE DEBT

ALSO UNTO THE DEVIL STICKS
THE DAYS OF THAT OLD NORTHERN PHANTOM NOW ARE OVER
WHERE CANST THOU HORNS AND TAIL AND CLAWS DISCOVER
AND AS REGARDS THE FOOT WHICH I CAN'T SPARE IN TRUTH
'TWOULD ONLY MAKE THE PEOPLE SHUN ME
THEREFORE I'VE WORN LIKE MANY A SPINDLY YOUTH
FALSE CALVES THESE MANY YEARS UPON ME
THE WITCH DANCING
REASON AND SENSE FORSAKE MY BRAIN
SINCE I BEHOLD SQUIRE SATAN HERE AGAIN
MEPHISTOPHELES

ARTICLES THEREIN MEANWHILE THE GLASSES BEGIN TO RING THE
CALDRON TO SOUND AND MAKE A MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT
FINALLY SHE BRINGS A GREAT BOOK AND STATIONS IN THE CIRCLE

SHE TALKS LIKE ONE WHO RAVES IN FEVER
MEPHISTOPHELES
THOU'LT HEAR MUCH MORE BEFORE WE LEAVE HER
'TIS ALL THE SAME THE BOOK I CAN REPEAT
SUCH TIME I'VE SQUANDERED O'ER THE HISTORY
A CONTRADICTION THUS COMPLETE
IS ALWAYS FOR THE WISE NO LESS THAN FOOLS A MYSTERY
THE ART IS OLD AND NEW FOR VERILY
ALL AGES HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THE MATTER
BY THREE AND ONE AND ONE AND THREE
ERROR INSTEAD OF TRUTH TO SCATTER
THEY PRATE AND TEACH AND NO ONE INTERFERES
ALL FROM THE FELLOWSHIP OF FOOLS ARE SHRINKING
MAN USUALLY BELIEVES IF ONLY WORDS HE HEARS
THAT ALSO WITH THEM GOES MATERIAL FOR THINKING
THE WITCH CONTINUES
THE LOFTY SKILL
OF SCIENCE STILL
FROM ALL MEN DEEPLY HIDDEN

MISERABLE FAUST I KNOW THEE NOW NO MORE
IS THERE A MAGIC VAPOR HERE
I CAME WITH LUST OF INSTANT PLEASURE
AND LIE DISSOLVED IN DREAMS OF LOVE'S SWEET LEISURE
ARE WE THE SPORT OF EVERY CHANGEFUL ATMOSPHERE
AND IF THIS MOMENT CAME SHE IN TO ME
HOW WOULD I FOR THE FAULT ATONEMENT RENDER
HOW SMALL THE GIANT LOUT WOULD BE
PRONE AT HER FEET RELAXED AND TENDER
MEPHISTOPHELES
BE QUICK I SEE HER THERE RETURNING
FAUST
GO GO I NEVER WILL RETREAT
MEPHISTOPHELES
HERE IS A CASKET NOT UNMEET
WHICH ELSEWHERE I HAVE JUST BEEN EARNING
HERE SET IT IN THE PRESS WITH HASTE
I SWEAR 'TWILL TURN HER HEAD TO SPY IT
SOME BAUBLES I THEREIN HAD PLACED
THAT YOU MIGHT WIN ANOTHER BY IT
TRUE CHILD IS CHILD AND PLAY IS PLAY
FAUST
I KNOW NOT SHOULD I DO IT
MEPHISTOPHELES
ASK YOU PRAY
YOURSELF PERHAPS WOULD KEEP THE BUBBLE
THEN I SUGGEST 'TWERE FAIR AND JUST
TO SPARE THE LOVELY DAY YOUR LUST
AND SPARE TO ME THE FURTHER TROUBLE
YOU ARE NOT MISERLY I TRUST
I RUB MY HANDS IN EXPECTATION TENDER
HE PLACES THE CASKET IN THE PRESS AND LOCKS IT AGAIN
NOW QUICK AWAY
THE SWEET YOUNG MAIDEN TO BETRAY
SO THAT BY WISH AND WILL YOU BEND HER
AND YOU LOOK AS THOUGH
TO THE LECTURE HALL YOU WERE FORCED TO GO
AS IF STOOD BEFORE YOU GRAY AND LOATH
PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS BOTH
BUT AWAY EXEUNT
MARGARET WITH A LAMP
IT IS SO CLOSE SO SULTRY HERE
SHE OPENS THE WINDOW
AND YET 'TIS NOT SO WARM OUTSIDE
I FEEL I KNOW NOT WHY SUCH FEAR
WOULD MOTHER CAME WHERE CAN SHE BIDE
MY BODY'S CHILL AND SHUDDERING
I'M BUT A SILLY FEARSOME THING
SHE BEGINS TO SING WHILE UNDRESSING
THERE WAS A KING IN THULE
WAS FAITHFUL TILL THE GRAVE
TO WHOM HIS MISTRESS DYING
A GOLDEN GOBLET GAVE
NAUGHT WAS TO HIM MORE PRECIOUS
HE DRAINED IT AT EVERY BOUT
HIS EYES WITH TEARS RAN OVER
AS OFT AS HE DRANK THEREOUT
WHEN CAME HIS TIME OF DYING
THE TOWNS IN HIS LAND HE TOLD
NAUGHT ELSE TO HIS HEIR DENYING
EXCEPT THE GOBLET OF GOLD
HE SAT AT THE ROYAL BANQUET
WITH HIS KNIGHTS OF HIGH DEGREE
IN THE LOFTY HALL OF HIS FATHERS
IN THE CASTLE BY THE SEA
THERE STOOD THE OLD CAROUSER
AND DRANK THE LAST LIFE GLOW
AND HURLED THE HALLOWED GOBLET
INTO THE TIDE BELOW
HE SAW IT PLUNGING AND FILLING
AND SINKING DEEP IN THE SEA
THEN FELL HIS EYELIDS FOREVER
AND NEVER MORE DRANK HE
SHE OPENS THE PRESS IN ORDER TO ARRANGE HER CLOTHES AND PERCEIVES
THE CASKET OF JEWELS
HOW COMES THAT LOVELY CASKET HERE TO ME
I LOCKED THE PRESS MOST CERTAINLY
'TIS TRULY WONDERFUL WHAT CAN WITHIN IT BE
PERHAPS 'TWAS BROUGHT BY SOME ONE AS A PAWN
AND MOTHER GAVE A LOAN THEREON
AND HERE THERE HANGS A KEY TO FIT
I HAVE A MIND TO OPEN IT
WHAT IS THAT GOD IN HEAVEN WHENCE CAME
SUCH THINGS NEVER BEHELD I AUGHT SO FAIR
RICH ORNAMENTS SUCH AS A NOBLE DAME
ON HIGHEST HOLIDAYS MIGHT WEAR
HOW WOULD THE PEARL CHAIN SUIT MY HAIR
AH WHO MAY ALL THIS SPLENDOR OWN
SHE ADORNS HERSELF WITH THE JEWELRY AND STEPS BEFORE THE
MIRROR
WERE BUT THE EAR RINGS MINE ALONE
ONE HAS AT ONCE ANOTHER AIR
WHAT HELPS ONE'S BEAUTY YOUTHFUL BLOOD
ONE MAY POSSESS THEM WELL AND GOOD
BUT NONE THE MORE DO OTHERS CARE
THEY PRAISE US HALF IN PITY SURE
TO GOLD STILL TENDS
ON GOLD DEPENDS
ALL ALL ALAS WE POOR

MEPHISTOPHELES
JUST THINK THE POCKET OF A PRIEST SHOULD GET
THE TRINKETS LEFT FOR MARGARET
THE MOTHER SAW THEM AND INSTANTER
A SECRET DREAD BEGAN TO HAUNT HER
KEEN SCENT HAS SHE FOR TAINTED AIR
SHE SNUFFS WITHIN HER BOOK OF PRAYER
AND SMELLS EACH ARTICLE TO SEE
IF SACRED OR PROFANE IT BE
SO HERE SHE GUESSED FROM EVERY GEM
THAT NOT MUCH BLESSING CAME WITH THEM
MY CHILD SHE SAID ILL GOTTEN GOOD
ENSNARES THE SOUL CONSUMES THE BLOOD
BEFORE THE MOTHER OF GOD WE'LL LAY IT
WITH HEAVENLY MANNA SHE'LL REPAY IT
BUT MARGARET THOUGHT WITH SOUR GRIMACE
A GIFT HORSE IS NOT OUT OF PLACE
AND TRULY GODLESS CANNOT BE
THE ONE WHO BROUGHT SUCH THINGS TO ME
A PARSON CAME BY THE MOTHER BIDDEN
HE SAW AT ONCE WHERE THE GAME WAS HIDDEN
AND VIEWED IT WITH A FAVOR STEALTHY
HE SPAKE THAT IS THE PROPER VIEW
WHO OVERCOMETH WINNETH TOO
THE HOLY CHURCH HAS A STOMACH HEALTHY
HATH EATEN MANY A LAND AS FORFEIT
AND NEVER YET COMPLAINED OF SURFEIT
THE CHURCH ALONE BEYOND ALL QUESTION
HAS FOR ILL GOTTEN GOODS THE RIGHT DIGESTION
FAUST
A GENERAL PRACTICE IS THE SAME
WHICH JEW AND KING MAY ALSO CLAIM
MEPHISTOPHELES
THEN BAGGED THE SPANGLES CHAINS AND RINGS

MEPHISTOPHELES

THOU WOULDST BE DEVIL ENOUGH TO GRUDGE MY SOUL THE BLESSING
MEPHISTOPHELES
A BLESSING DRAWN FROM SUPERNATURAL FOUNTAINS
IN NIGHT AND DEW TO LIE UPON THE MOUNTAINS
ALL HEAVEN AND EARTH IN RAPTURE PENETRATING
THYSELF TO GODHOOD HAUGHTILY INFLATING
TO GRUB WITH YEARNING FORCE THROUGH EARTH'S DARK MARROW
COMPRESS THE SIX DAYS' WORK WITHIN THY BOSOM NARROW
TO TASTE I KNOW NOT WHAT IN HAUGHTY POWER
THINE OWN ECSTATIC LIFE ON ALL THINGS SHOWER
THINE EARTHLY SELF BEHIND THEE CAST
AND THEN THE LOFTY INSTINCT THUS
WITH A GESTURE
AT LAST
DAREN'T SAY HOW TO PLUCK THE FINAL FLOWER
FAUST
SHAME ON THEE
MEPHISTOPHELES
YES THOU FINDEST THAT UNPLEASANT
THOU HAST THE MORAL RIGHT TO CRY ME SHAME AT PRESENT
ONE DARES NOT THAT BEFORE CHASTE EARS DECLARE
WHICH CHASTE HEARTS NOTWITHSTANDING CANNOT SPARE
AND ONCE FOR ALL I GRUDGE THEE NOT THE PLEASURE
OF LYING TO THYSELF IN MODERATE MEASURE
BUT SUCH A COURSE THOU WILT NOT LONG ENDURE
ALREADY ART THOU O'ER EXCITED
AND IF IT LAST WILT SOON BE PLIGHTED
TO MADNESS AND TO HORROR SURE
ENOUGH OF THAT THY LOVE SITS LONELY YONDER
BY ALL THINGS SADDENED AND OPPRESSED
HER THOUGHTS AND YEARNINGS SEEK THEE TENDERER FONDER
MIGHTY LOVE IS IN HER BREAST
FIRST CAME THY PASSION'S FLOOD AND POURED AROUND HER
AS WHEN FROM MELTED SNOW A STREAMLET OVERFLOWS
THOU HAST THEREWITH SO FILLED AND DROWNED HER
THAT NOW THY STREAM ALL SHALLOW SHOWS
METHINKS INSTEAD OF IN THE FORESTS LORDING
THE NOBLE SIR SHOULD FIND IT GOOD
THE LOVE OF THIS YOUNG SILLY BLOOD
AT ONCE TO SET ABOUT REWARDING
HER TIME IS MISERABLY LONG
SHE HAUNTS HER WINDOW WATCHING CLOUDS THAT STRAY
O'ER THE OLD CITY WALL AND FAR AWAY
WERE I A LITTLE BIRD SO RUNS HER SONG
DAY LONG AND HALF NIGHT LONG
NOW SHE IS LIVELY MOSTLY SAD
NOW WEPT BEYOND HER TEARS
THEN AGAIN QUIET SHE APPEARS ALWAYS
LOVE MAD

SERPENT SERPENT
MEPHISTOPHELES ASIDE

WHAT WOULDST THOU THEN SHE THINKS THAT THOU ART FLOWN
AND HALF AND HALF THOU ART I OWN
FAUST
YET AM I NEAR AND LOVE KEEPS WATCH AND WARD
THOUGH I WERE NE'ER SO FAR IT CANNOT FALTER
I ENVY EVEN THE BODY OF THE LORD
THE TOUCHING OF HER LIPS BEFORE THE ALTAR

ON YOUR TWIN PAIR THAT FEED AMONG THE ROSES

PERCEIVED THE NOBLEST PURPOSE OF HIS TRADE
AND ALSO MADE THEIR OPPORTUNITY
GO ON IT IS A WOE PROFOUND
'TIS FOR YOUR SWEETHEART'S ROOM YOU'RE BOUND
AND NOT FOR DEATH INDEED
FAUST
WHAT ARE WITHIN HER ARMS THE HEAVENLY BLISSES
THOUGH I BE GLOWING WITH HER KISSES
DO I NOT ALWAYS SHARE HER NEED
I AM THE FUGITIVE ALL HOUSELESS ROAMING
THE MONSTER WITHOUT AIR OR REST
THAT LIKE A CATARACT DOWN ROCKS AND GORGES FOAMING
LEAPS MADDENED INTO THE ABYSS'S BREAST
AND SIDE WARDS SHE WITH YOUNG UNWAKENED SENSES
WITHIN HER CABIN ON THE ALPINE FIELD
HER SIMPLE HOMELY LIFE COMMENCES
HER LITTLE WORLD THEREIN CONCEALED
AND I GOD'S HATE FLUNG O'ER ME
HAD NOT ENOUGH TO THRUST
THE STUBBORN ROCKS BEFORE ME
AND STRIKE THEM INTO DUST
SHE AND HER PEACE I YET MUST UNDERMINE
THOU HELL HAST CLAIMED THIS SACRIFICE AS THINE
HELP DEVIL THROUGH THE COMING PANGS TO PUSH ME
WHAT MUST BE LET IT QUICKLY BE
LET FALL ON ME HER FATE AND ALSO CRUSH ME
ONE RUIN WHELM BOTH HER AND ME
MEPHISTOPHELES
AGAIN IT SEETHES AGAIN IT GLOWS
THOU FOOL GO IN AND COMFORT HER
WHEN SUCH A HEAD AS THINE NO OUTLET KNOWS
IT THINKS THE END MUST SOON OCCUR

THOU ELSE DOST WELL THE DEVIL NATURE WEAR
NAUGHT SO INSIPID IN THE WORLD I FIND
AS IS A DEVIL IN DESPAIR

LIKE SISTER MARGARET GOOD AS GOLD
ONE THAT TO HER CAN A CANDLE HOLD
CLING CLANG HERE'S TO HER WENT AROUND
THE BOARD HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH CRIED SOME
IN HER THE FLOWER O' THE SEX IS FOUND
AND ALL THE SWAGGERERS WERE DUMB
AND NOW I COULD TEAR MY HAIR WITH VEXATION
AND DASH OUT MY BRAINS IN DESPERATION
WITH TURNED UP NOSE EACH SCAMP MAY FACE ME
WITH SNEERS AND STINGING TAUNTS DISGRACE ME

A CHANCE DROPPED WORD MAY SET ME SWEATING

WITH WHAT FIERCE BLOWS UPON MY NECK 'TIS BEATING
MEPHISTOPHELES
UNDER THE OLD RIBS OF THE ROCK RETREATING
HOLD FAST LEST THOU BE HURLED DOWN THE ABYSSES THERE
THE NIGHT WITH THE MIST IS BLACK
HARK HOW THE FORESTS GRIND AND CRACK
FRIGHTENED THE OWLETS ARE SCATTERED
HEARKEN THE PILLARS ARE SHATTERED
THE EVERGREEN PALACES SHAKING
BOUGHS ARE GROANING AND BREAKING
THE TREE TRUNKS TERRIBLY THUNDER
THE ROOTS ARE TWISTING ASUNDER
IN FRIGHTFULLY INTRICATE CRASHING
EACH ON THE OTHER IS DASHING
AND OVER THE WRECK STREWN GORGES
THE TEMPEST WHISTLES AND SURGES
HEAR'ST THOU VOICES HIGHER RINGING
FAR AWAY OR NEARER SINGING
YES THE MOUNTAIN'S SIDE ALONG
SWEEPS AN INFURIATE GLAMOURING SONG
WITCHES IN CHORUS
THE WITCHES RIDE TO THE BROCKEN'S TOP
THE STUBBLE IS YELLOW AND GREEN THE CROP
THERE GATHERS THE CROWD FOR CARNIVAL
SIR URIAN SITS OVER ALL
AND SO THEY GO OVER STONE AND STOCK
THE WITCH SHE S AND S THE BUCK
A VOICE
ALONE OLD BAUBO'S COMING NOW
SHE RIDES UPON A FARROW SOW
CHORUS
THEN HONOR TO WHOM THE HONOR IS DUE
DAME BAUBO FIRST TO LEAD THE CREW
A TOUGH OLD SOW AND THE MOTHER THEREON
THEN FOLLOW THE WITCHES EVERY ONE
A VOICE
WHICH WAY COM'ST THOU HITHER
VOICE
O'ER THE ILSEN STONE
I PEEPED AT THE OWL IN HER NEST ALONE
HOW SHE STARED AND GLARED
VOICE
BETAKE THEE TO HELL
WHY SO FAST AND SO FELL
VOICE
SHE HAS SCORED AND HAS FLAYED ME
SEE THE WOUNDS SHE HAS MADE ME
WITCHES CHORUS
THE WAY IS WIDE THE WAY IS LONG
SEE WHAT A WILD AND CRAZY THRONG
THE BROOM IT SCRATCHES THE FORK IT THRUSTS
THE CHILD IS STIFLED THE MOTHER BURSTS
WIZARDS SEMICHORUS
AS DOTH THE SNAIL IN SHELL WE CRAWL
BEFORE US GO THE WOMEN ALL
WHEN TOWARDS THE DEVIL'S HOUSE WE TREAD
WOMAN'S A THOUSAND STEPS AHEAD
OTHER SEMICHORUS
WE DO NOT MEASURE WITH SUCH CARE
WOMAN IN THOUSAND STEPS IS THEFT
BUT HOWSOE'ER SHE HASTEN MAY
MAN IN ONE LEAP HAS CLEARED THE WAY
VOICE FROM ABOVE
COME ON COME ON FROM ROCKY LAKE
VOICE FROM BELOW
ALOFT WE'D FAIN OURSELVES BETAKE
WE'VE WASHED AND ARE BRIGHT AS EVER YOU WILL
YET WE'RE ETERNALLY STERILE STILL
BOTH CHORUSES
THE WIND IS HUSHED THE STAR SHOOTS BY
THE DREARY MOON FORSAKES THE SKY
THE MAGIC NOTES LIKE SPARK ON SPARK
DRIZZLE WHISTLING THROUGH THE DARK
VOICE FROM BELOW
HALT THERE HO THERE
VOICE FROM ABOVE
WHO CALLS FROM THE ROCKY CLEFT BELOW THERE
VOICE BELOW
TAKE ME TOO TAKE ME TOO
I'M CLIMBING NOW THREE HUNDRED YEARS
AND YET THE SUMMIT CANNOT SEE
AMONG MY EQUALS I WOULD BE
BOTH CHORUSES
BEARS THE BROOM AND BEARS THE STOCK
BEARS THE FORK AND BEARS THE BUCK
WHO CANNOT RAISE HIMSELF TO NIGHT
IS EVERMORE A RUINED WIGHT
HALF WITCH BELOW
SO LONG I STUMBLE ILL BESTEAD
AND THE OTHERS ARE NOW SO FAR AHEAD
AT HOME I'VE NEITHER REST NOR CHEER
AND YET I CANNOT GAIN THEM HERE
CHORUS OF WITCHES
TO CHEER THE WITCH WILL SALVE AVAIL
A RAG WILL ANSWER FOR A SAIL
EACH TROUGH A GOODLY SHIP SUPPLIES
HE NE'ER WILL FLY WHO NOW NOT FLIES
BOTH CHORUSES
WHEN ROUND THE SUMMIT WHIRLS OUR FLIGHT
THEN LOWER AND ON THE GROUND ALIGHT
AND FAR AND WIDE THE HEATHER PRESS
WITH WITCHHOOD'S SWARMS OF WANTONNESS
THEY SETTLE DOWN
MEPHISTOPHELES
THEY CROWD AND PUSH THEY ROAR AND CLATTER
THEY WHIRL AND WHISTLE PULL AND CHATTER
THEY SHINE AND SPIRT AND STINK AND BURN
THE TRUE WITCH ELEMENT WE LEARN
KEEP CLOSE OR WE ARE PARTED IN OUR TURN
WHERE ART THOU
FAUST IN THE DISTANCE

THEN HOUSE RIGHT I MUST USE AND CLEAR THE WAY
MAKE ROOM SQUIRE VOLAND COMES ROOM GENTLE RABBLE
ROOM
HERE DOCTOR HOLD TO ME IN ONE JUMP WE'LL RESUME
AN EASIER SPACE AND FROM THE CROWD BE FREE
IT'S TOO MUCH EVEN FOR THE LIKE OF ME
YONDER WITH SPECIAL LIGHT THERE'S SOMETHING SHINING CLEARER
WITHIN THOSE BUSHES I'VE A MIND TO SEE
COME ON WELL SLIP A LITTLE NEARER
FAUST
SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION ON I'LL FOLLOW STRAIGHT
'TIS PLANNED MOST WISELY IF I JUDGE ARIGHT
WE CLIMB THE BROCKEN'S TOP IN THE WALPURGIS NIGHT
THAT ARBITRARILY HERE OURSELVES WE ISOLATE
MEPHISTOPHELES
BUT SEE WHAT MOTLEY FLAMES AMONG THE HEATHER
THERE IS A LIVELY CLUB TOGETHER
IN SMALLER CIRCLES ONE IS NOT ALONE
FAUST
BETTER THE SUMMIT I MUST OWN
THERE FIRE AND WHIRLING SMOKE I SEE
THEY SEEK THE EVIL ONE IN WILD CONFUSION
MANY ENIGMAS THERE MIGHT FIND SOLUTION
MEPHISTOPHELES
BUT THERE ENIGMAS ALSO KNOTTED BE
LEAVE TO THE MULTITUDE THEIR RIOT
HERE WILL WE HOUSE OURSELVES IN QUIET
IT IS AN OLD TRANSMITTED TRADE
THAT IN THE GREATER WORLD THE LITTLE WORLDS ARE MADE
I SEE STARK NUDE YOUNG WITCHES CONGREGATE
AND OLD ONES VEILED AND HIDDEN SHREWDLY
ON MY ACCOUNT BE KIND NOR TREAT THEM RUDELY
THE TROUBLE'S SMALL THE FUN IS GREAT
I HEAR THE NOISE OF INSTRUMENTS ATTUNING
VILE DIN YET ONE MUST LEARN TO BEAR THE CROONING
COME COME ALONG IT MUST BE I DECLARE
I'LL GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE THEE THERE
THINE OBLIGATION NEWLY EARNING
THAT IS NO LITTLE SPACE WHAT SAY'ST THOU FRIEND
LOOK YONDER THOU CANST SCARCELY SEE THE END
A HUNDRED FIRES ALONG THE RANKS ARE BURNING
THEY DANCE THEY CHAT THEY COOK THEY DRINK THEY COURT
NOW WHERE JUST TELL ME IS THERE BETTER SPORT
FAUST
WILT THOU TO INTRODUCE US TO THE REVEL
ASSUME THE PART OF WIZARD OR OF DEVIL
MEPHISTOPHELES
I'M MOSTLY USED 'TIS TRUE TO GO INCOGNITO
BUT ON A GALA DAY ONE MAY HIS ORDERS SHOW
THE GARTER DOES NOT DECK MY SUIT
BUT HONORED AND AT HOME IS HERE THE CLOVEN FOOT
PERCEIV'ST THOU YONDER SNAIL IT COMETH SLOW AND STEADY
SO DELICATELY ITS FEELERS PRY
THAT IT HATH SCENTED ME ALREADY
I CANNOT HERE DISGUISE ME IF I TRY
BUT COME WE'LL GO FROM THIS FIRE TO A NEWER
I AM THE GO BETWEEN AND THOU THE WOOER
TO SOME WHO ARE SITTING AROUND DYING EMBERS
OLD GENTLEMEN WHY AT THE OUTSKIRTS ENTER
I'D PRAISE YOU IF I FOUND YOU SNUGLY IN THE CENTRE
WITH YOUTH AND REVEL ROUND YOU LIKE A ZONE
YOU EACH AT HOME ARE QUITE ENOUGH ALONE
GENERAL
SAY WHO WOULD PUT HIS TRUST IN NATIONS
HOWE'ER FOR THEM ONE MAY HAVE WORKED AND PLANNED
FOR WITH THE PEOPLE AS WITH WOMEN
YOUTH ALWAYS HAS THE UPPER HAND
MINISTER
THEY'RE NOW TOO FAR FROM WHAT IS JUST AND SAGE
I PRAISE THE OLD ONES NOT UNDULY
WHEN WE WERE ALL IN ALL THEN TRULY
THEN WAS THE REAL GOLDEN AGE

AND WHAT WE SHOULD NOT OFTEN DID
BUT NOW ALL THINGS HAVE FROM THEIR BASES SLID
JUST AS WE MEANT TO HOLD THEM FAST TOGETHER

NO DAGGER'S HERE THAT SET NOT BLOOD TO FLOWING
NO CUP THAT HATH NOT ONCE WITHIN A HEALTHY FRAME
POURED SPEEDY DEATH IN POISON GLOWING

NO SWORD BUT SEVERED TIES FOR THE UNWARY
OR FROM BEHIND STRUCK DOWN THE ADVERSARY
MEPHISTOPHELES

A LOVELY DREAM ONCE CAME TO ME

APPLES HAVE BEEN DESIRED BY YOU
SINCE FIRST IN PARADISE THEY GREW

WHY DOES HE COME THEN TO OUR BALL
FAUST DANCING
O EVERYWHERE ON HIM YOU FALL
WHEN OTHERS DANCE HE WEIGHS THE MATTER
IF HE CAN'T EVERY STEP BECHATTER
THEN 'TIS THE SAME AS WERE THE STEP NOT MADE
BUT IF YOU FORWARDS GO HIS IRE IS MOST DISPLAYED
IF YOU WOULD WHIRL IN REGULAR GYRATION
AS HE DOES IN HIS DULL OLD MILL
HE'D SHOW AT ANY RATE GOOD WILL
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HEARD AND HEEDED HIS HORTATION
PROKTOPHANTASMIST
YOU STILL ARE HERE NAY 'TIS A THING UNHEARD
VANISH AT ONCE WE'VE SAID THE ENLIGHTENING WORD

TWILL NE'ER BE CLEAN WHY 'TIS A THING UNHEARD
THE FAIR ONE

TO OVERCOME THE POETS AND THE DEVILS
MEPHISTOPHELES
HE NOW WILL SEAT HIM IN THE NEAREST PUDDLE
THE SOLACE THIS WHEREOF HE'S MOST ASSURED
AND WHEN UPON HIS RUMP THE LEECHES HANG AND FUDDLE
HE'LL BE OF SPIRITS AND OF SPIRIT CURED

WHEREFORE FORSAKEST THOU THE LOVELY MAIDEN

TWAS PERSEUS LOPPED IT HER OLD ADVERSARY

PREFACE
I HAVE CAREFULLY COLLECTED WHATEVER I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEARN OF THE
STORY OF POOR WERTHER AND HERE PRESENT IT TO YOU KNOWING THAT YOU
WILL THANK ME FOR IT
TO HIS SPIRIT AND CHARACTER YOU CANNOT REFUSE YOUR
ADMIRATION AND LOVE TO HIS FATE YOU WILL NOT DENY YOUR TEARS
AND THOU GOOD SOUL WHO SUFFEREST THE SAME DISTRESS AS HE ENDURED ONCE
DRAW COMFORT FROM HIS SORROWS AND LET THIS LITTLE BOOK BE THY FRIEND
IF OWING TO FORTUNE OR THROUGH THINE OWN FAULT THOU CANST NOT FIND A
DEARER COMPANION
BOOK I
MAY 4
HOW HAPPY I AM THAT I AM GONE MY DEAR FRIEND WHAT A THING IS THE HEART
OF MAN TO LEAVE YOU FROM WHOM I HAVE BEEN INSEPARABLE WHOM I LOVE
SO DEARLY AND YET TO FEEL HAPPY I KNOW YOU WILL FORGIVE ME
HAVE NOT
OTHER ATTACHMENTS BEEN SPECIALLY APPOINTED BY FATE TO TORMENT A HEAD
LIKE MINE POOR LEONORA AND YET I WAS NOT TO BLAME
WAS IT MY FAULT
THAT WHILST THE PECULIAR CHARMS OF HER SISTER AFFORDED ME AN AGREEABLE
ENTERTAINMENT A PASSION FOR ME WAS ENGENDERED IN HER FEEBLE HEART AND
YET AM I WHOLLY BLAMELESS DID I NOT ENCOURAGE HER EMOTIONS DID I NOT
FEEL CHARMED AT THOSE TRULY GENUINE EXPRESSIONS OF NATURE WHICH THOUGH
BUT LITTLE MIRTHFUL IN REALITY SO OFTEN AMUSED US DID I NOT BUT
OH WHAT IS MAN THAT HE DARES SO TO ACCUSE HIMSELF MY DEAR FRIEND I
PROMISE YOU I WILL IMPROVE I WILL NO LONGER AS HAS EVER BEEN MY HABIT
CONTINUE TO RUMINATE ON EVERY PETTY VEXATION WHICH FORTUNE MAY DISPENSE
I WILL ENJOY THE PRESENT AND THE PAST SHALL BE FOR ME THE PAST
NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT MY BEST OF FRIENDS THERE WOULD BE FAR LESS
SUFFERING AMONGST MANKIND IF MEN AND GOD KNOWS WHY THEY ARE SO
FASHIONED DID NOT EMPLOY THEIR IMAGINATIONS SO ASSIDUOUSLY IN RECALLING
THE MEMORY OF PAST SORROW INSTEAD OF BEARING THEIR PRESENT LOT WITH
EQUANIMITY
BE KIND ENOUGH TO INFORM MY MOTHER THAT I SHALL ATTEND TO
HER BUSINESS TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AND SHALL GIVE HER THE EARLIEST
INFORMATION ABOUT IT
I HAVE SEEN MY AUNT AND FIND THAT SHE IS VERY FAR
FROM BEING THE DISAGREEABLE PERSON OUR FRIENDS ALLEGE HER TO BE
SHE IS
A LIVELY CHEERFUL WOMAN WITH THE BEST OF HEARTS
I EXPLAINED TO HER MY
MOTHER'S WRONGS WITH REGARD TO THAT PART OF HER PORTION WHICH HAS
BEEN WITHHELD FROM HER
SHE TOLD ME THE MOTIVES AND REASONS OF HER OWN
CONDUCT AND THE TERMS ON WHICH SHE IS WILLING TO GIVE UP THE WHOLE
AND TO DO MORE THAN WE HAVE ASKED
IN SHORT I CANNOT WRITE FURTHER UPON
THIS SUBJECT AT PRESENT ONLY ASSURE MY MOTHER THAT ALL WILL GO ON WELL
AND I HAVE AGAIN OBSERVED MY DEAR FRIEND IN THIS TRIFLING AFFAIR THAT
MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND NEGLECT OCCASION MORE MISCHIEF IN THE WORLD THAN
EVEN MALICE AND WICKEDNESS
AT ALL EVENTS THE TWO LATTER ARE OF LESS
FREQUENT OCCURRENCE
IN OTHER RESPECTS I AM VERY WELL OFF HERE
SOLITUDE IN THIS TERRESTRIAL
PARADISE IS A GENIAL BALM TO MY MIND AND THE YOUNG SPRING CHEERS WITH
ITS BOUNTEOUS PROMISES MY OFTENTIMES MISGIVING HEART
EVERY TREE EVERY
BUSH IS FULL OF FLOWERS AND ONE MIGHT WISH HIMSELF TRANSFORMED INTO A
BUTTERFLY TO FLOAT ABOUT IN THIS OCEAN OF PERFUME AND FIND HIS WHOLE
EXISTENCE IN IT
THE TOWN ITSELF IS DISAGREEABLE BUT THEN ALL AROUND YOU FIND AN
INEXPRESSIBLE BEAUTY OF NATURE
THIS INDUCED THE LATE COUNT M TO LAY
OUT A GARDEN ON ONE OF THE SLOPING HILLS WHICH HERE INTERSECT EACH OTHER
WITH THE MOST CHARMING VARIETY AND FORM THE MOST LOVELY VALLEYS
THE
GARDEN IS SIMPLE AND IT IS EASY TO PERCEIVE EVEN UPON YOUR FIRST
ENTRANCE THAT THE PLAN WAS NOT DESIGNED BY A SCIENTIFIC GARDENER BUT
BY A MAN WHO WISHED TO GIVE HIMSELF UP HERE TO THE ENJOYMENT OF HIS OWN
SENSITIVE HEART
MANY A TEAR HAVE I ALREADY SHED TO THE MEMORY OF ITS
DEPARTED MASTER IN A SUMMER HOUSE WHICH IS NOW REDUCED TO RUINS BUT
WAS HIS FAVOURITE RESORT AND NOW IS MINE
I SHALL SOON BE MASTER OF THE
PLACE
THE GARDENER HAS BECOME ATTACHED TO ME WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS
AND HE WILL LOSE NOTHING THEREBY
MAY 10
A WONDERFUL SERENITY HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF MY ENTIRE SOUL LIKE THESE
SWEET MORNINGS OF SPRING WHICH I ENJOY WITH MY WHOLE HEART
I AM ALONE
AND FEEL THE CHARM OF EXISTENCE IN THIS SPOT WHICH WAS CREATED FOR THE
BLISS OF SOULS LIKE MINE
I AM SO HAPPY MY DEAR FRIEND SO ABSORBED
IN THE EXQUISITE SENSE OF MERE TRANQUIL EXISTENCE THAT I NEGLECT MY
TALENTS
I SHOULD BE INCAPABLE OF DRAWING A SINGLE STROKE AT THE PRESENT
MOMENT AND YET I FEEL THAT I NEVER WAS A GREATER ARTIST THAN NOW
WHEN
WHILE THE LOVELY VALLEY TEEMS WITH VAPOUR AROUND ME AND THE MERIDIAN
SUN STRIKES THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE IMPENETRABLE FOLIAGE OF MY TREES
AND BUT A FEW STRAY GLEAMS STEAL INTO THE INNER SANCTUARY I THROW
MYSELF DOWN AMONG THE TALL GRASS BY THE TRICKLING STREAM AND AS I LIE
CLOSE TO THE EARTH A THOUSAND UNKNOWN PLANTS ARE NOTICED BY ME WHEN
I HEAR THE BUZZ OF THE LITTLE WORLD AMONG THE STALKS AND GROW FAMILIAR
WITH THE COUNTLESS INDESCRIBABLE FORMS OF THE INSECTS AND FLIES THEN I
FEEL THE PRESENCE OF THE ALMIGHTY WHO FORMED US IN HIS OWN IMAGE AND
THE BREATH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LOVE WHICH BEARS AND SUSTAINS US AS IT
FLOATS AROUND US IN AN ETERNITY OF BLISS AND THEN MY FRIEND WHEN
DARKNESS OVERSPREADS MY EYES AND HEAVEN AND EARTH SEEM TO DWELL IN MY
SOUL AND ABSORB ITS POWER LIKE THE FORM OF A BELOVED MISTRESS THEN I
OFTEN THINK WITH LONGING OH WOULD I COULD DESCRIBE THESE CONCEPTIONS
COULD IMPRESS UPON PAPER ALL THAT IS LIVING SO FULL AND WARM WITHIN ME
THAT IT MIGHT BE THE MIRROR OF MY SOUL AS MY SOUL IS THE MIRROR OF THE
INFINITE GOD O MY FRIEND BUT IT IS TOO MUCH FOR MY STRENGTH I SINK
UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE SPLENDOUR OF THESE VISIONS
MAY 12
I KNOW NOT WHETHER SOME DECEITFUL SPIRITS HAUNT THIS SPOT OR WHETHER
IT BE THE WARM CELESTIAL FANCY IN MY OWN HEART WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING
AROUND ME SEEM LIKE PARADISE
IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE IS A FOUNTAIN A
FOUNTAIN TO WHICH I AM BOUND BY A CHARM LIKE MELUSINA AND HER SISTERS
DESCENDING A GENTLE SLOPE YOU COME TO AN ARCH WHERE SOME TWENTY STEPS
LOWER DOWN WATER OF THE CLEAREST CRYSTAL GUSHES FROM THE MARBLE ROCK
THE NARROW WALL WHICH ENCLOSES IT ABOVE THE TALL TREES WHICH ENCIRCLE
THE SPOT AND THE COOLNESS OF THE PLACE ITSELF EVERYTHING IMPARTS
A PLEASANT BUT SUBLIME IMPRESSION
NOT A DAY PASSES ON WHICH I DO NOT
SPEND AN HOUR THERE
THE YOUNG MAIDENS COME FROM THE TOWN TO FETCH
WATER INNOCENT AND NECESSARY EMPLOYMENT AND FORMERLY THE OCCUPATION
OF THE DAUGHTERS OF KINGS
AS I TAKE MY REST THERE THE IDEA OF THE OLD
PATRIARCHAL LIFE IS AWAKENED AROUND ME
I SEE THEM OUR OLD ANCESTORS
HOW THEY FORMED THEIR FRIENDSHIPS AND CONTRACTED ALLIANCES AT THE
FOUNTAIN SIDE AND I FEEL HOW FOUNTAINS AND STREAMS WERE GUARDED BY
BENEFICENT SPIRITS
HE WHO IS A STRANGER TO THESE SENSATIONS HAS NEVER
REALLY ENJOYED COOL REPOSE AT THE SIDE OF A FOUNTAIN AFTER THE FATIGUE
OF A WEARY SUMMER DAY
MAY 13
YOU ASK IF YOU SHALL SEND ME BOOKS
MY DEAR FRIEND I BESEECH YOU
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD RELIEVE ME FROM SUCH A YOKE I NEED NO MORE TO BE
GUIDED AGITATED HEATED
MY HEART FERMENTS SUFFICIENTLY OF ITSELF
I WANT STRAINS TO LULL ME AND I FIND THEM TO PERFECTION IN MY HOMER
OFTEN DO I STRIVE TO ALLAY THE BURNING FEVER OF MY BLOOD AND YOU HAVE
NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING SO UNSTEADY SO UNCERTAIN AS MY HEART
BUT
NEED I CONFESS THIS TO YOU MY DEAR FRIEND WHO HAVE SO OFTEN ENDURED
THE ANGUISH OF WITNESSING MY SUDDEN TRANSITIONS FROM SORROW TO
IMMODERATE JOY AND FROM SWEET MELANCHOLY TO VIOLENT PASSIONS I TREAT
MY POOR HEART LIKE A SICK CHILD AND GRATIFY ITS EVERY FANCY
DO NOT
MENTION THIS AGAIN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD CENSURE ME FOR IT
MAY 15
THE COMMON PEOPLE OF THE PLACE KNOW ME ALREADY AND LOVE ME
PARTICULARLY THE CHILDREN
WHEN AT FIRST I ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND
INQUIRED IN A FRIENDLY TONE ABOUT THEIR VARIOUS TRIFLES SOME FANCIED
THAT I WISHED TO RIDICULE THEM AND TURNED FROM ME IN EXCEEDING
ILL HUMOUR
I DID NOT ALLOW THAT CIRCUMSTANCE TO GRIEVE ME I ONLY FELT
MOST KEENLY WHAT I HAVE OFTEN BEFORE OBSERVED
PERSONS WHO CAN CLAIM
A CERTAIN RANK KEEP THEMSELVES COLDLY ALOOF FROM THE COMMON PEOPLE
AS THOUGH THEY FEARED TO LOSE THEIR IMPORTANCE BY THE CONTACT WHILST
WANTON IDLERS AND SUCH AS ARE PRONE TO BAD JOKING AFFECT TO DESCEND
TO THEIR LEVEL ONLY TO MAKE THE POOR PEOPLE FEEL THEIR IMPERTINENCE ALL
THE MORE KEENLY
I KNOW VERY WELL THAT WE ARE NOT ALL EQUAL NOR CAN BE SO BUT IT IS MY
OPINION THAT HE WHO AVOIDS THE COMMON PEOPLE IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE THEIR
RESPECT IS AS MUCH TO BLAME AS A COWARD WHO HIDES HIMSELF FROM HIS
ENEMY BECAUSE HE FEARS DEFEAT
THE OTHER DAY I WENT TO THE FOUNTAIN AND FOUND A YOUNG SERVANT GIRL
WHO HAD SET HER PITCHER ON THE LOWEST STEP AND LOOKED AROUND TO SEE
IF ONE OF HER COMPANIONS WAS APPROACHING TO PLACE IT ON HER HEAD
I RAN
DOWN AND LOOKED AT HER
SHALL I HELP YOU PRETTY LASS SAID I
SHE
BLUSHED DEEPLY
OH SIR SHE EXCLAIMED
NO CEREMONY I REPLIED
SHE
ADJUSTED HER HEAD GEAR AND I HELPED HER
SHE THANKED ME AND ASCENDED
THE STEPS
MAY 17
I HAVE MADE ALL SORTS OF ACQUAINTANCES BUT HAVE AS YET FOUND NO
SOCIETY
I KNOW NOT WHAT ATTRACTION I POSSESS FOR THE PEOPLE SO MANY
OF THEM LIKE ME AND ATTACH THEMSELVES TO ME AND THEN I FEEL SORRY WHEN
THE ROAD WE PURSUE TOGETHER GOES ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE
IF YOU INQUIRE
WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE LIKE HERE I MUST ANSWER THE SAME AS EVERYWHERE
THE HUMAN RACE IS BUT A MONOTONOUS AFFAIR
MOST OF THEM LABOUR THE
GREATER PART OF THEIR TIME FOR MERE SUBSISTENCE AND THE SCANTY PORTION
OF FREEDOM WHICH REMAINS TO THEM SO TROUBLES THEM THAT THEY USE EVERY
EXERTION TO GET RID OF IT
OH THE DESTINY OF MAN
BUT THEY ARE A RIGHT GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE
IF I OCCASIONALLY FORGET
MYSELF AND TAKE PART IN THE INNOCENT PLEASURES WHICH ARE NOT YET
FORBIDDEN TO THE PEASANTRY AND ENJOY MYSELF FOR INSTANCE WITH
GENUINE FREEDOM AND SINCERITY ROUND A WELL COVERED TABLE OR ARRANGE AN
EXCURSION OR A DANCE OPPORTUNELY AND SO FORTH ALL THIS PRODUCES A GOOD
EFFECT UPON MY DISPOSITION ONLY I MUST FORGET THAT THERE LIE DORMANT
WITHIN ME SO MANY OTHER QUALITIES WHICH MOULDER USELESSLY AND WHICH
I AM OBLIGED TO KEEP CAREFULLY CONCEALED
AH THIS THOUGHT AFFECTS MY
SPIRITS FEARFULLY
AND YET TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD IS THE FATE OF THE LIKE
OF US
ALAS THAT THE FRIEND OF MY YOUTH IS GONE ALAS THAT I EVER KNEW HER I
MIGHT SAY TO MYSELF YOU ARE A DREAMER TO SEEK WHAT IS NOT TO BE FOUND
HERE BELOW BUT SHE HAS BEEN MINE
I HAVE POSSESSED THAT HEART THAT
NOBLE SOUL IN WHOSE PRESENCE I SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN I REALLY WAS
BECAUSE I WAS ALL THAT I COULD BE
GOOD HEAVENS DID THEN A SINGLE POWER
OF MY SOUL REMAIN UNEXERCISED IN HER PRESENCE COULD I NOT DISPLAY TO
ITS FULL EXTENT THAT MYSTERIOUS FEELING WITH WHICH MY HEART EMBRACES
NATURE WAS NOT OUR INTERCOURSE A PERPETUAL WEB OF THE FINEST EMOTIONS
OF THE KEENEST WIT THE VARIETIES OF WHICH EVEN IN THEIR VERY
ECCENTRICITY BORE THE STAMP OF GENIUS ALAS THE FEW YEARS BY WHICH SHE
WAS MY SENIOR BROUGHT HER TO THE GRAVE BEFORE ME
NEVER CAN I FORGET HER
FIRM MIND OR HER HEAVENLY PATIENCE
A FEW DAYS AGO I MET A CERTAIN YOUNG V A FRANK OPEN FELLOW WITH
A MOST PLEASING COUNTENANCE
HE HAS JUST LEFT THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT
DEEM HIMSELF OVERWISE BUT BELIEVES HE KNOWS MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE
HE HAS WORKED HARD AS I CAN PERCEIVE FROM MANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN
SHORT POSSESSES A LARGE STOCK OF INFORMATION
WHEN HE HEARD THAT I AM
DRAWING A GOOD DEAL AND THAT I KNOW GREEK TWO WONDERFUL THINGS FOR
THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY HE CAME TO SEE ME AND DISPLAYED HIS WHOLE
STORE OF LEARNING FROM BATTEAUX TO WOOD FROM DE PILES TO WINKELMANN
HE ASSURED ME HE HAD READ THROUGH THE FIRST PART OF SULTZER'S THEORY
AND ALSO POSSESSED A MANUSCRIPT OF HEYNE'S WORK ON THE STUDY OF THE
ANTIQUE
I ALLOWED IT ALL TO PASS
I HAVE BECOME ACQUAINTED ALSO WITH A VERY WORTHY PERSON THE DISTRICT
JUDGE A FRANK AND OPEN HEARTED MAN
I AM TOLD IT IS A MOST DELIGHTFUL
THING TO SEE HIM IN THE MIDST OF HIS CHILDREN OF WHOM HE HAS NINE
HIS
ELDEST DAUGHTER ESPECIALLY IS HIGHLY SPOKEN OF
HE HAS INVITED ME TO GO
AND SEE HIM AND I INTEND TO DO SO ON THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
HE LIVES
AT ONE OF THE ROYAL HUNTING LODGES WHICH CAN BE REACHED FROM HERE IN AN
HOUR AND A HALF BY WALKING AND WHICH HE OBTAINED LEAVE TO INHABIT AFTER
THE LOSS OF HIS WIFE AS IT IS SO PAINFUL TO HIM TO RESIDE IN TOWN AND
AT THE COURT
THERE HAVE ALSO COME IN MY WAY A FEW OTHER ORIGINALS OF A QUESTIONABLE
SORT WHO ARE IN ALL RESPECTS UNDESIRABLE AND MOST INTOLERABLE IN THEIR
DEMONSTRATION OF FRIENDSHIP
GOOD BYE
THIS LETTER WILL PLEASE YOU IT
IS QUITE HISTORICAL
MAY 22
THAT THE LIFE OF MAN IS BUT A DREAM MANY A MAN HAS SURMISED HERETOFORE
AND I TOO AM EVERYWHERE PURSUED BY THIS FEELING
WHEN I CONSIDER
THE NARROW LIMITS WITHIN WHICH OUR ACTIVE AND INQUIRING FACULTIES ARE
CONFINED WHEN I SEE HOW ALL OUR ENERGIES ARE WASTED IN PROVIDING FOR
MERE NECESSITIES WHICH AGAIN HAVE NO FURTHER END THAN TO PROLONG
A WRETCHED EXISTENCE AND THEN THAT ALL OUR SATISFACTION CONCERNING
CERTAIN SUBJECTS OF INVESTIGATION ENDS IN NOTHING BETTER THAN A PASSIVE
RESIGNATION WHILST WE AMUSE OURSELVES PAINTING OUR PRISON WALLS WITH
BRIGHT FIGURES AND BRILLIANT LANDSCAPES WHEN I CONSIDER ALL THIS
WILHELM I AM SILENT
I EXAMINE MY OWN BEING AND FIND THERE A WORLD
BUT A WORLD RATHER OF IMAGINATION AND DIM DESIRES THAN OF DISTINCTNESS
AND LIVING POWER
THEN EVERYTHING SWIMS BEFORE MY SENSES AND I SMILE
AND DREAM WHILE PURSUING MY WAY THROUGH THE WORLD
ALL LEARNED PROFESSORS AND DOCTORS ARE AGREED THAT CHILDREN DO NOT
COMPREHEND THE CAUSE OF THEIR DESIRES BUT THAT THE GROWN UP SHOULD
WANDER ABOUT THIS EARTH LIKE CHILDREN WITHOUT KNOWING WHENCE THEY COME
OR WHITHER THEY GO INFLUENCED AS LITTLE BY FIXED MOTIVES BUT GUIDED
LIKE THEM BY BISCUITS SUGAR PLUMS AND THE ROD THIS IS WHAT NOBODY IS
WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND YET I THINK IT IS PALPABLE
I KNOW WHAT YOU WILL SAY IN REPLY FOR I AM READY TO ADMIT THAT THEY ARE
HAPPIEST WHO LIKE CHILDREN AMUSE THEMSELVES WITH THEIR PLAYTHINGS
DRESS AND UNDRESS THEIR DOLLS AND ATTENTIVELY WATCH THE CUPBOARD
WHERE MAMMA HAS LOCKED UP HER SWEET THINGS AND WHEN AT LAST THEY GET
A DELICIOUS MORSEL EAT IT GREEDILY AND EXCLAIM MORE THESE ARE
CERTAINLY HAPPY BEINGS BUT OTHERS ALSO ARE OBJECTS OF ENVY WHO DIGNIFY
THEIR PALTRY EMPLOYMENTS AND SOMETIMES EVEN THEIR PASSIONS WITH
POMPOUS TITLES REPRESENTING THEM TO MANKIND AS GIGANTIC ACHIEVEMENTS
PERFORMED FOR THEIR WELFARE AND GLORY
BUT THE MAN WHO HUMBLY
ACKNOWLEDGES THE VANITY OF ALL THIS WHO OBSERVES WITH WHAT PLEASURE
THE THRIVING CITIZEN CONVERTS HIS LITTLE GARDEN INTO A PARADISE AND HOW
PATIENTLY EVEN THE POOR MAN PURSUES HIS WEARY WAY UNDER HIS BURDEN
AND HOW ALL WISH EQUALLY TO BEHOLD THE LIGHT OF THE SUN A LITTLE
LONGER YES SUCH A MAN IS AT PEACE AND CREATES HIS OWN WORLD WITHIN
HIMSELF AND HE IS ALSO HAPPY BECAUSE HE IS A MAN
AND THEN HOWEVER
LIMITED HIS SPHERE HE STILL PRESERVES IN HIS BOSOM THE SWEET FEELING OF
LIBERTY AND KNOWS THAT HE CAN QUIT HIS PRISON WHENEVER HE LIKES
MAY 26
YOU KNOW OF OLD MY WAYS OF SETTLING ANYWHERE OF SELECTING A LITTLE
COTTAGE IN SOME COSY SPOT AND OF PUTTING UP IN IT WITH EVERY
INCONVENIENCE
HERE TOO I HAVE DISCOVERED SUCH A SNUG COMFORTABLE
PLACE WHICH POSSESSES PECULIAR CHARMS FOR ME
ABOUT A LEAGUE FROM THE TOWN IS A PLACE CALLED WALHEIM
THE READER
NEED NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO LOOK FOR THE PLACE THUS DESIGNATED
WE HAVE
FOUND IT NECESSARY TO CHANGE THE NAMES GIVEN IN THE ORIGINAL IT IS
DELIGHTFULLY SITUATED ON THE SIDE OF A HILL AND BY PROCEEDING ALONG
ONE OF THE FOOTPATHS WHICH LEAD OUT OF THE VILLAGE YOU CAN HAVE A VIEW
OF THE WHOLE VALLEY
A GOOD OLD WOMAN LIVES THERE WHO KEEPS A SMALL
INN
SHE SELLS WINE BEER AND COFFEE AND IS CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT
NOTWITHSTANDING HER AGE
THE CHIEF CHARM OF THIS SPOT CONSISTS IN TWO
LINDEN TREES SPREADING THEIR ENORMOUS BRANCHES OVER THE LITTLE GREEN
BEFORE THE CHURCH WHICH IS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY PEASANTS' COTTAGES
BARNS AND HOMESTEADS
I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A PLACE SO RETIRED AND
PEACEABLE AND THERE OFTEN HAVE MY TABLE AND CHAIR BROUGHT OUT FROM
THE LITTLE INN AND DRINK MY COFFEE THERE AND READ MY HOMER
ACCIDENT
BROUGHT ME TO THE SPOT ONE FINE AFTERNOON AND I FOUND IT PERFECTLY
DESERTED
EVERYBODY WAS IN THE FIELDS EXCEPT A LITTLE BOY ABOUT FOUR
YEARS OF AGE WHO WAS SITTING ON THE GROUND AND HELD BETWEEN HIS KNEES
A CHILD ABOUT SIX MONTHS OLD HE PRESSED IT TO HIS BOSOM WITH BOTH
ARMS WHICH THUS FORMED A SORT OF ARM CHAIR AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE
LIVELINESS WHICH SPARKLED IN ITS BLACK EYES IT REMAINED PERFECTLY
STILL
THE SIGHT CHARMED ME
I SAT DOWN UPON A PLOUGH OPPOSITE AND
SKETCHED WITH GREAT DELIGHT THIS LITTLE PICTURE OF BROTHERLY TENDERNESS
I ADDED THE NEIGHBOURING HEDGE THE BARN DOOR AND SOME BROKEN
CART WHEELS JUST AS THEY HAPPENED TO LIE AND I FOUND IN ABOUT AN HOUR
THAT I HAD MADE A VERY CORRECT AND INTERESTING DRAWING WITHOUT PUTTING
IN THE SLIGHTEST THING OF MY OWN
THIS CONFIRMED ME IN MY RESOLUTION
OF ADHERING FOR THE FUTURE ENTIRELY TO NATURE
SHE ALONE IS
INEXHAUSTIBLE AND CAPABLE OF FORMING THE GREATEST MASTERS
MUCH MAY BE
ALLEGED IN FAVOUR OF RULES AS MUCH MAY BE LIKEWISE ADVANCED IN FAVOUR
OF THE LAWS OF SOCIETY AN ARTIST FORMED UPON THEM WILL NEVER PRODUCE
ANYTHING ABSOLUTELY BAD OR DISGUSTING AS A MAN WHO OBSERVES THE LAWS
AND OBEYS DECORUM CAN NEVER BE AN ABSOLUTELY INTOLERABLE NEIGHBOUR NOR
A DECIDED VILLAIN BUT YET SAY WHAT YOU WILL OF RULES THEY DESTROY THE
GENUINE FEELING OF NATURE AS WELL AS ITS TRUE EXPRESSION
DO NOT TELL
ME THAT THIS IS TOO HARD THAT THEY ONLY RESTRAIN AND PRUNE SUPERFLUOUS
BRANCHES ETC MY GOOD FRIEND I WILL ILLUSTRATE THIS BY AN ANALOGY
THESE THINGS RESEMBLE LOVE
A WARMHEARTED YOUTH BECOMES STRONGLY
ATTACHED TO A MAIDEN HE SPENDS EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY IN HER COMPANY
WEARS OUT HIS HEALTH AND LAVISHES HIS FORTUNE TO AFFORD CONTINUAL
PROOF THAT HE IS WHOLLY DEVOTED TO HER
THEN COMES A MAN OF THE WORLD A
MAN OF PLACE AND RESPECTABILITY AND ADDRESSES HIM THUS MY GOOD YOUNG
FRIEND LOVE IS NATURAL BUT YOU MUST LOVE WITHIN BOUNDS
DIVIDE YOUR
TIME DEVOTE A PORTION TO BUSINESS AND GIVE THE HOURS OF RECREATION TO
YOUR MISTRESS
CALCULATE YOUR FORTUNE AND OUT OF THE SUPERFLUITY YOU
MAY MAKE HER A PRESENT ONLY NOT TOO OFTEN ON HER BIRTHDAY AND SUCH
OCCASIONS PURSUING THIS ADVICE HE MAY BECOME A USEFUL MEMBER OF
SOCIETY AND I SHOULD ADVISE EVERY PRINCE TO GIVE HIM AN APPOINTMENT
BUT IT IS ALL UP WITH HIS LOVE AND WITH HIS GENIUS IF HE BE AN ARTIST
O MY FRIEND WHY IS IT THAT THE TORRENT OF GENIUS SO SELDOM BURSTS
FORTH SO SELDOM ROLLS IN FULL FLOWING STREAM OVERWHELMING YOUR
ASTOUNDED SOUL BECAUSE ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS STREAM COLD AND
RESPECTABLE PERSONS HAVE TAKEN UP THEIR ABODES AND FORSOOTH THEIR
SUMMER HOUSES AND TULIP BEDS WOULD SUFFER FROM THE TORRENT WHEREFORE
THEY DIG TRENCHES AND RAISE EMBANKMENTS BETIMES IN ORDER TO AVERT THE
IMPENDING DANGER
MAY 27
I FIND I HAVE FALLEN INTO RAPTURES DECLAMATION AND SIMILES AND HAVE
FORGOTTEN IN CONSEQUENCE TO TELL YOU WHAT BECAME OF THE CHILDREN
ABSORBED IN MY ARTISTIC CONTEMPLATIONS WHICH I BRIEFLY DESCRIBED IN MY
LETTER OF YESTERDAY I CONTINUED SITTING ON THE PLOUGH FOR TWO HOURS
TOWARD EVENING A YOUNG WOMAN WITH A BASKET ON HER ARM CAME RUNNING
TOWARD THE CHILDREN WHO HAD NOT MOVED ALL THAT TIME
SHE EXCLAIMED
FROM A DISTANCE YOU ARE A GOOD BOY PHILIP SHE GAVE ME GREETING I
RETURNED IT ROSE AND APPROACHED HER
I INQUIRED IF SHE WERE THE MOTHER
OF THOSE PRETTY CHILDREN
YES SHE SAID AND GIVING THE ELDEST A
PIECE OF BREAD SHE TOOK THE LITTLE ONE IN HER ARMS AND KISSED IT WITH
A MOTHER'S TENDERNESS
I LEFT MY CHILD IN PHILIP'S CARE SHE SAID
WHILST I WENT INTO THE TOWN WITH MY ELDEST BOY TO BUY SOME WHEATEN
BREAD SOME SUGAR AND AN EARTHEN POT I SAW THE VARIOUS ARTICLES IN
THE BASKET FROM WHICH THE COVER HAD FALLEN
I SHALL MAKE SOME BROTH
TO NIGHT FOR MY LITTLE HANS WHICH WAS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGEST
THAT WILD FELLOW THE BIG ONE BROKE MY POT YESTERDAY WHILST HE WAS
SCRAMBLING WITH PHILIP FOR WHAT REMAINED OF THE CONTENTS I INQUIRED
FOR THE ELDEST AND SHE HAD SCARCELY TIME TO TELL ME THAT HE WAS DRIVING
A COUPLE OF GEESE HOME FROM THE MEADOW WHEN HE RAN UP AND HANDED
PHILIP AN OSIER TWIG
I TALKED A LITTLE LONGER WITH THE WOMAN AND FOUND
THAT SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THAT HER HUSBAND WAS
GONE ON A JOURNEY INTO SWITZERLAND FOR SOME MONEY A RELATION HAD LEFT
HIM
THEY WANTED TO CHEAT HIM SHE SAID AND WOULD NOT ANSWER
HIS LETTERS SO HE IS GONE THERE HIMSELF
I HOPE HE HAS MET WITH NO
ACCIDENT AS I HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF HIM SINCE HIS DEPARTURE I LEFT
THE WOMAN WITH REGRET GIVING EACH OF THE CHILDREN A KREUTZER WITH AN
ADDITIONAL ONE FOR THE YOUNGEST TO BUY SOME WHEATEN BREAD FOR HIS BROTH
WHEN SHE WENT TO TOWN NEXT AND SO WE PARTED
I ASSURE YOU MY DEAR
FRIEND WHEN MY THOUGHTS ARE ALL IN TUMULT THE SIGHT OF SUCH A
CREATURE AS THIS TRANQUILLISES MY DISTURBED MIND
SHE MOVES IN A
HAPPY THOUGHTLESSNESS WITHIN THE CONFINED CIRCLE OF HER EXISTENCE SHE
SUPPLIES HER WANTS FROM DAY TO DAY AND WHEN SHE SEES THE LEAVES FALL
THEY RAISE NO OTHER IDEA IN HER MIND THAN THAT WINTER IS APPROACHING
SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE GONE OUT THERE FREQUENTLY
THE CHILDREN HAVE
BECOME QUITE FAMILIAR WITH ME AND EACH GETS A LUMP OF SUGAR WHEN I
DRINK MY COFFEE AND THEY SHARE MY MILK AND BREAD AND BUTTER IN THE
EVENING
THEY ALWAYS RECEIVE THEIR KREUTZER ON SUNDAYS FOR THE GOOD
WOMAN HAS ORDERS TO GIVE IT TO THEM WHEN I DO NOT GO THERE AFTER EVENING
SERVICE
THEY ARE QUITE AT HOME WITH ME TELL ME EVERYTHING AND I AM
PARTICULARLY AMUSED WITH OBSERVING THEIR TEMPERS AND THE SIMPLICITY OF
THEIR BEHAVIOUR WHEN SOME OF THE OTHER VILLAGE CHILDREN ARE ASSEMBLED
WITH THEM
IT HAS GIVEN ME A DEAL OF TROUBLE TO SATISFY THE ANXIETY OF THE MOTHER
LEST AS SHE SAYS THEY SHOULD INCONVENIENCE THE GENTLEMAN
MAY 30
WHAT I HAVE LATELY SAID OF PAINTING IS EQUALLY TRUE WITH RESPECT TO
POETRY
IT IS ONLY NECESSARY FOR US TO KNOW WHAT IS REALLY EXCELLENT
AND VENTURE TO GIVE IT EXPRESSION AND THAT IS SAYING MUCH IN FEW WORDS
TO DAY I HAVE HAD A SCENE WHICH IF LITERALLY RELATED WOULD MAKE THE
MOST BEAUTIFUL IDYL IN THE WORLD
BUT WHY SHOULD I TALK OF POETRY AND
SCENES AND IDYLS CAN WE NEVER TAKE PLEASURE IN NATURE WITHOUT HAVING
RECOURSE TO ART
IF YOU EXPECT ANYTHING GRAND OR MAGNIFICENT FROM THIS INTRODUCTION
YOU WILL BE SADLY MISTAKEN
IT RELATES MERELY TO A PEASANT LAD WHO
HAS EXCITED IN ME THE WARMEST INTEREST
AS USUAL I SHALL TELL MY STORY
BADLY AND YOU AS USUAL WILL THINK ME EXTRAVAGANT
IT IS WALHEIM ONCE
MORE ALWAYS WALHEIM WHICH PRODUCES THESE WONDERFUL PHENOMENA
A PARTY HAD ASSEMBLED OUTSIDE THE HOUSE UNDER THE LINDEN TREES TO DRINK
COFFEE
THE COMPANY DID NOT EXACTLY PLEASE ME AND UNDER ONE PRETEXT OR
ANOTHER I LINGERED BEHIND
A PEASANT CAME FROM AN ADJOINING HOUSE AND SET TO WORK ARRANGING SOME
PART OF THE SAME PLOUGH WHICH I HAD LATELY SKETCHED
HIS APPEARANCE
PLEASED ME AND I SPOKE TO HIM INQUIRED ABOUT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES MADE
HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND AS IS MY WONT WITH PERSONS OF THAT CLASS WAS
SOON ADMITTED INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
HE SAID HE WAS IN THE SERVICE OF
A YOUNG WIDOW WHO SET GREAT STORE BY HIM
HE SPOKE SO MUCH OF HIS
MISTRESS AND PRAISED HER SO EXTRAVAGANTLY THAT I COULD SOON SEE HE WAS
DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH HER
SHE IS NO LONGER YOUNG HE SAID AND
SHE WAS TREATED SO BADLY BY HER FORMER HUSBAND THAT SHE DOES NOT MEAN
TO MARRY AGAIN FROM HIS ACCOUNT IT WAS SO EVIDENT WHAT INCOMPARABLE
CHARMS SHE POSSESSED FOR HIM AND HOW ARDENTLY HE WISHED SHE WOULD
SELECT HIM TO EXTINGUISH THE RECOLLECTION OF HER FIRST HUSBAND'S
MISCONDUCT THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO REPEAT HIS OWN WORDS IN ORDER TO
DESCRIBE THE DEPTH OF THE POOR FELLOW'S ATTACHMENT TRUTH AND DEVOTION
IT WOULD IN FACT REQUIRE THE GIFTS OF A GREAT POET TO CONVEY THE
EXPRESSION OF HIS FEATURES THE HARMONY OF HIS VOICE AND THE HEAVENLY
FIRE OF HIS EYE
NO WORDS CAN PORTRAY THE TENDERNESS OF HIS EVERY
MOVEMENT AND OF EVERY FEATURE NO EFFORT OF MINE COULD DO JUSTICE TO THE
SCENE
HIS ALARM LEST I SHOULD MISCONCEIVE HIS POSITION WITH REGARD
TO HIS MISTRESS OR QUESTION THE PROPRIETY OF HER CONDUCT TOUCHED ME
PARTICULARLY
THE CHARMING MANNER WITH WHICH HE DESCRIBED HER FORM AND
PERSON WHICH WITHOUT POSSESSING THE GRACES OF YOUTH WON AND ATTACHED
HIM TO HER IS INEXPRESSIBLE AND MUST BE LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION
I
HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE WITNESSED OR FANCIED OR CONCEIVED THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH INTENSE DEVOTION SUCH ARDENT AFFECTIONS UNITED WITH SO MUCH
PURITY
DO NOT BLAME ME IF I SAY THAT THE RECOLLECTION OF THIS INNOCENCE
AND TRUTH IS DEEPLY IMPRESSED UPON MY VERY SOUL THAT THIS PICTURE OF
FIDELITY AND TENDERNESS HAUNTS ME EVERYWHERE AND THAT MY OWN HEART AS
THOUGH ENKINDLED BY THE FLAME GLOWS AND BURNS WITHIN ME
I MEAN NOW TO TRY AND SEE HER AS SOON AS I CAN OR PERHAPS ON SECOND
THOUGHTS I HAD BETTER NOT IT IS BETTER I SHOULD BEHOLD HER THROUGH THE
EYES OF HER LOVER
TO MY SIGHT PERHAPS SHE WOULD NOT APPEAR AS SHE NOW
STANDS BEFORE ME AND WHY SHOULD I DESTROY SO SWEET A PICTURE
JUNE 16
WHY DO I NOT WRITE TO YOU YOU LAY CLAIM TO LEARNING AND ASK SUCH A
QUESTION
YOU SHOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT I AM WELL THAT IS TO SAY IN A
WORD I HAVE MADE AN ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAS WON MY HEART I HAVE I KNOW
NOT
TO GIVE YOU A REGULAR ACCOUNT OF THE MANNER IN WHICH I HAVE BECOME
ACQUAINTED WITH THE MOST AMIABLE OF WOMEN WOULD BE A DIFFICULT TASK
I
AM A HAPPY AND CONTENTED MORTAL BUT A POOR HISTORIAN
AN ANGEL NONSENSE EVERYBODY SO DESCRIBES HIS MISTRESS AND YET I FIND
IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL YOU HOW PERFECT SHE IS OR WHY SHE IS SO PERFECT
SUFFICE IT TO SAY SHE HAS CAPTIVATED ALL MY SENSES
SO MUCH SIMPLICITY WITH SO MUCH UNDERSTANDING SO MILD AND YET SO
RESOLUTE A MIND SO PLACID AND A LIFE SO ACTIVE
BUT ALL THIS IS UGLY BALDERDASH WHICH EXPRESSES NOT A SINGLE CHARACTER
NOR FEATURE
SOME OTHER TIME BUT NO NOT SOME OTHER TIME NOW THIS
VERY INSTANT WILL I TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT
NOW OR NEVER
WELL BETWEEN
OURSELVES SINCE I COMMENCED MY LETTER I HAVE BEEN THREE TIMES ON THE
POINT OF THROWING DOWN MY PEN OF ORDERING MY HORSE AND RIDING OUT
AND YET I VOWED THIS MORNING THAT I WOULD NOT RIDE TO DAY AND YET EVERY
MOMENT I AM RUSHING TO THE WINDOW TO SEE HOW HIGH THE SUN IS
I COULD NOT RESTRAIN MYSELF GO TO HER I MUST
I HAVE JUST RETURNED
WILHELM AND WHILST I AM TAKING SUPPER I WILL WRITE TO YOU
WHAT
A DELIGHT IT WAS FOR MY SOUL TO SEE HER IN THE MIDST OF HER DEAR
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN EIGHT BROTHERS AND SISTERS
BUT IF I PROCEED THUS YOU WILL BE NO WISER AT THE END OF MY LETTER
THAN YOU WERE AT THE BEGINNING
ATTEND THEN AND I WILL COMPEL MYSELF
TO GIVE YOU THE DETAILS
I MENTIONED TO YOU THE OTHER DAY THAT I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH S
THE DISTRICT JUDGE AND THAT HE HAD INVITED ME TO GO AND VISIT HIM IN
HIS RETIREMENT OR RATHER IN HIS LITTLE KINGDOM
BUT I NEGLECTED GOING
AND PERHAPS SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE IF CHANCE HAD NOT DISCOVERED TO ME
THE TREASURE WHICH LAY CONCEALED IN THAT RETIRED SPOT
SOME OF OUR YOUNG
PEOPLE HAD PROPOSED GIVING A BALL IN THE COUNTRY AT WHICH I CONSENTED
TO BE PRESENT
I OFFERED MY HAND FOR THE EVENING TO A PRETTY AND
AGREEABLE BUT RATHER COMMONPLACE SORT OF GIRL FROM THE IMMEDIATE
NEIGHBOURHOOD AND IT WAS AGREED THAT I SHOULD ENGAGE A CARRIAGE AND
CALL UPON CHARLOTTE WITH MY PARTNER AND HER AUNT TO CONVEY THEM TO THE
BALL
MY COMPANION INFORMED ME AS WE DROVE ALONG THROUGH THE PARK
TO THE HUNTING LODGE THAT I SHOULD MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A VERY
CHARMING YOUNG LADY
TAKE CARE ADDED THE AUNT THAT YOU DO NOT LOSE
YOUR HEART WHY SAID I
BECAUSE SHE IS ALREADY ENGAGED TO A VERY
WORTHY MAN SHE REPLIED WHO IS GONE TO SETTLE HIS AFFAIRS UPON
THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER AND WILL SUCCEED TO A VERY CONSIDERABLE
INHERITANCE THIS INFORMATION POSSESSED NO INTEREST FOR ME
WHEN
WE ARRIVED AT THE GATE THE SUN WAS SETTING BEHIND THE TOPS OF THE
MOUNTAINS
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS HEAVY AND THE LADIES EXPRESSED THEIR
FEARS OF AN APPROACHING STORM AS MASSES OF LOW BLACK CLOUDS WERE
GATHERING IN THE HORIZON
I RELIEVED THEIR ANXIETIES BY PRETENDING TO BE
WEATHER WISE ALTHOUGH I MYSELF HAD SOME APPREHENSIONS LEST OUR PLEASURE
SHOULD BE INTERRUPTED
I ALIGHTED AND A MAID CAME TO THE DOOR AND REQUESTED US TO WAIT A
MOMENT FOR HER MISTRESS
I WALKED ACROSS THE COURT TO A WELL BUILT
HOUSE AND ASCENDING THE FLIGHT OF STEPS IN FRONT OPENED THE DOOR
AND SAW BEFORE ME THE MOST CHARMING SPECTACLE I HAD EVER WITNESSED
SIX
CHILDREN FROM ELEVEN TO TWO YEARS OLD WERE RUNNING ABOUT THE HALL AND
SURROUNDING A LADY OF MIDDLE HEIGHT WITH A LOVELY FIGURE DRESSED IN A
ROBE OF SIMPLE WHITE TRIMMED WITH PINK RIBBONS
SHE WAS HOLDING A RYE
LOAF IN HER HAND AND WAS CUTTING SLICES FOR THE LITTLE ONES ALL AROUND
IN PROPORTION TO THEIR AGE AND APPETITE
SHE PERFORMED HER TASK IN A
GRACEFUL AND AFFECTIONATE MANNER EACH CLAIMANT AWAITING HIS TURN WITH
OUTSTRETCHED HANDS AND BOISTEROUSLY SHOUTING HIS THANKS
SOME OF THEM
RAN AWAY AT ONCE TO ENJOY THEIR EVENING MEAL WHILST OTHERS OF A
GENTLER DISPOSITION RETIRED TO THE COURTYARD TO SEE THE STRANGERS AND
TO SURVEY THE CARRIAGE IN WHICH THEIR CHARLOTTE WAS TO DRIVE AWAY
PRAY
FORGIVE ME FOR GIVING YOU THE TROUBLE TO COME FOR ME AND FOR KEEPING
THE LADIES WAITING BUT DRESSING AND ARRANGING SOME HOUSEHOLD DUTIES
BEFORE I LEAVE HAD MADE ME FORGET MY CHILDREN'S SUPPER AND THEY DO
NOT LIKE TO TAKE IT FROM ANY ONE BUT ME I UTTERED SOME INDIFFERENT
COMPLIMENT BUT MY WHOLE SOUL WAS ABSORBED BY HER AIR HER VOICE HER
MANNER AND I HAD SCARCELY RECOVERED MYSELF WHEN SHE RAN INTO HER ROOM
TO FETCH HER GLOVES AND FAN
THE YOUNG ONES THREW INQUIRING GLANCES AT
ME FROM A DISTANCE WHILST I APPROACHED THE YOUNGEST A MOST DELICIOUS
LITTLE CREATURE
HE DREW BACK AND CHARLOTTE ENTERING AT THE VERY
MOMENT SAID LOUIS SHAKE HANDS WITH YOUR COUSIN THE LITTLE FELLOW
OBEYED WILLINGLY AND I COULD NOT RESIST GIVING HIM A HEARTY KISS
NOTWITHSTANDING HIS RATHER DIRTY FACE
COUSIN SAID I TO CHARLOTTE
AS I HANDED HER DOWN DO YOU THINK I DESERVE THE HAPPINESS OF BEING
RELATED TO YOU SHE REPLIED WITH A READY SMILE OH I HAVE SUCH
A NUMBER OF COUSINS THAT I SHOULD BE SORRY IF YOU WERE THE MOST
UNDESERVING OF THEM IN TAKING LEAVE SHE DESIRED HER NEXT SISTER
SOPHY A GIRL ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS OLD TO TAKE GREAT CARE OF THE
CHILDREN AND TO SAY GOOD BYE TO PAPA FOR HER WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM HIS
RIDE
SHE ENJOINED TO THE LITTLE ONES TO OBEY THEIR SISTER SOPHY AS THEY
WOULD HERSELF UPON WHICH SOME PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD BUT A LITTLE
FAIR HAIRED GIRL ABOUT SIX YEARS OLD LOOKED DISCONTENTED AND SAID
BUT SOPHY IS NOT YOU CHARLOTTE AND WE LIKE YOU BEST THE TWO ELDEST
BOYS HAD CLAMBERED UP THE CARRIAGE AND AT MY REQUEST SHE PERMITTED
THEM TO ACCOMPANY US A LITTLE WAY THROUGH THE FOREST UPON THEIR
PROMISING TO SIT VERY STILL AND HOLD FAST
WE WERE HARDLY SEATED AND THE LADIES HAD SCARCELY EXCHANGED
COMPLIMENTS MAKING THE USUAL REMARKS UPON EACH OTHER'S DRESS AND UPON
THE COMPANY THEY EXPECTED TO MEET WHEN CHARLOTTE STOPPED THE CARRIAGE
AND MADE HER BROTHERS GET DOWN
THEY INSISTED UPON KISSING HER HANDS
ONCE MORE WHICH THE ELDEST DID WITH ALL THE TENDERNESS OF A YOUTH
OF FIFTEEN BUT THE OTHER IN A LIGHTER AND MORE CARELESS MANNER
SHE
DESIRED THEM AGAIN TO GIVE HER LOVE TO THE CHILDREN AND WE DROVE OFF
THE AUNT INQUIRED OF CHARLOTTE WHETHER SHE HAD FINISHED THE BOOK SHE HAD
LAST SENT HER
NO SAID CHARLOTTE I DID NOT LIKE IT YOU CAN HAVE
IT AGAIN
AND THE ONE BEFORE WAS NOT MUCH BETTER I WAS SURPRISED UPON
ASKING THE TITLE TO HEAR THAT IT WAS
WE FEEL OBLIGED TO SUPPRESS
THE PASSAGE IN THE LETTER TO PREVENT ANY ONE FROM FEELING AGGRIEVED
ALTHOUGH NO AUTHOR NEED PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE OPINION OF A MERE
GIRL OR THAT OF AN UNSTEADY YOUNG MAN
I FOUND PENETRATION AND CHARACTER IN EVERYTHING SHE SAID EVERY
EXPRESSION SEEMED TO BRIGHTEN HER FEATURES WITH NEW CHARMS WITH
NEW RAYS OF GENIUS WHICH UNFOLDED BY DEGREES AS SHE FELT HERSELF
UNDERSTOOD
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER SHE OBSERVED I LOVED NOTHING SO MUCH AS
ROMANCES
NOTHING COULD EQUAL MY DELIGHT WHEN ON SOME HOLIDAY I COULD
SETTLE DOWN QUIETLY IN A CORNER AND ENTER WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND SOUL
INTO THE JOYS OR SORROWS OF SOME FICTITIOUS LEONORA
I DO NOT DENY THAT
THEY EVEN POSSESS SOME CHARMS FOR ME YET
BUT I READ SO SELDOM THAT I
PREFER BOOKS SUITED EXACTLY TO MY TASTE
AND I LIKE THOSE AUTHORS BEST
WHOSE SCENES DESCRIBE MY OWN SITUATION IN LIFE AND THE FRIENDS WHO ARE
ABOUT ME WHOSE STORIES TOUCH ME WITH INTEREST FROM RESEMBLING MY OWN
HOMELY EXISTENCE WHICH WITHOUT BEING ABSOLUTELY PARADISE IS ON THE
WHOLE A SOURCE OF INDESCRIBABLE HAPPINESS
I ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL THE EMOTION WHICH THESE WORDS OCCASIONED BUT
IT WAS OF SLIGHT AVAIL FOR WHEN SHE HAD EXPRESSED SO TRULY HER OPINION
OF THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD AND OF OTHER WORKS THE NAMES OF WHICH I
OMIT THOUGH THE NAMES ARE OMITTED YET THE AUTHORS MENTIONED DESERVE
CHARLOTTE'S APPROBATION AND WILL FEEL IT IN THEIR HEARTS WHEN THEY READ
THIS PASSAGE
IT CONCERNS NO OTHER PERSON I COULD NO LONGER CONTAIN
MYSELF BUT GAVE FULL UTTERANCE TO WHAT I THOUGHT OF IT AND IT WAS NOT
UNTIL CHARLOTTE HAD ADDRESSED HERSELF TO THE TWO OTHER LADIES THAT
I REMEMBERED THEIR PRESENCE AND OBSERVED THEM SITTING MUTE WITH
ASTONISHMENT
THE AUNT LOOKED AT ME SEVERAL TIMES WITH AN AIR OF
RAILLERY WHICH HOWEVER I DID NOT AT ALL MIND
WE TALKED OF THE PLEASURES OF DANCING
IF IT IS A FAULT TO LOVE IT
SAID CHARLOTTE I AM READY TO CONFESS THAT I PRIZE IT ABOVE ALL OTHER
AMUSEMENTS
IF ANYTHING DISTURBS ME I GO TO THE PIANO PLAY AN AIR TO
WHICH I HAVE DANCED AND ALL GOES RIGHT AGAIN DIRECTLY
YOU WHO KNOW ME CAN FANCY HOW STEADFASTLY I GAZED UPON HER RICH DARK
EYES DURING THESE REMARKS HOW MY VERY SOUL GLOATED OVER HER WARM LIPS
AND FRESH GLOWING CHEEKS HOW I BECAME QUITE LOST IN THE DELIGHTFUL
MEANING OF HER WORDS SO MUCH SO THAT I SCARCELY HEARD THE ACTUAL
EXPRESSIONS
IN SHORT I ALIGHTED FROM THE CARRIAGE LIKE A PERSON IN A
DREAM AND WAS SO LOST TO THE DIM WORLD AROUND ME THAT I SCARCELY HEARD
THE MUSIC WHICH RESOUNDED FROM THE ILLUMINATED BALLROOM
THE TWO MESSRS
ANDRAN AND A CERTAIN N
N
I CANNOT TROUBLE MYSELF WITH
THE NAMES WHO WERE THE AUNT'S AND CHARLOTTE'S PARTNERS RECEIVED US
AT THE CARRIAGE DOOR AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THEIR LADIES WHILST I
FOLLOWED WITH MINE
WE COMMENCED WITH A MINUET
I LED OUT ONE LADY AFTER ANOTHER AND
PRECISELY THOSE WHO WERE THE MOST DISAGREEABLE COULD NOT BRING
THEMSELVES TO LEAVE OFF
CHARLOTTE AND HER PARTNER BEGAN AN ENGLISH
COUNTRY DANCE AND YOU MUST IMAGINE MY DELIGHT WHEN IT WAS THEIR TURN
TO DANCE THE FIGURE WITH US
YOU SHOULD SEE CHARLOTTE DANCE
SHE DANCES
WITH HER WHOLE HEART AND SOUL HER FIGURE IS ALL HARMONY ELEGANCE
AND GRACE AS IF SHE WERE CONSCIOUS OF NOTHING ELSE AND HAD NO
OTHER THOUGHT OR FEELING AND DOUBTLESS FOR THE MOMENT EVERY OTHER
SENSATION IS EXTINCT
SHE WAS ENGAGED FOR THE SECOND COUNTRY DANCE BUT PROMISED ME THE THIRD
AND ASSURED ME WITH THE MOST AGREEABLE FREEDOM THAT SHE WAS VERY
FOND OF WALTZING
IT IS THE CUSTOM HERE SHE SAID FOR THE PREVIOUS
PARTNERS TO WALTZ TOGETHER BUT MY PARTNER IS AN INDIFFERENT WALTZER
AND WILL FEEL DELIGHTED IF I SAVE HIM THE TROUBLE
YOUR PARTNER IS NOT
ALLOWED TO WALTZ AND INDEED IS EQUALLY INCAPABLE BUT I OBSERVED
DURING THE COUNTRY DANCE THAT YOU WALTZ WELL SO IF YOU WILL WALTZ WITH
ME I BEG YOU WOULD PROPOSE IT TO MY PARTNER AND I WILL PROPOSE IT TO
YOURS WE AGREED AND IT WAS ARRANGED THAT OUR PARTNERS SHOULD MUTUALLY
ENTERTAIN EACH OTHER
WE SET OFF AND AT FIRST DELIGHTED OURSELVES WITH THE USUAL GRACEFUL
MOTIONS OF THE ARMS
WITH WHAT GRACE WITH WHAT EASE SHE MOVED WHEN
THE WALTZ COMMENCED AND THE DANCERS WHIRLED AROUND EACH OTHER IN THE
GIDDY MAZE THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION OWING TO THE INCAPACITY OF SOME OF
THE DANCERS
WE JUDICIOUSLY REMAINED STILL ALLOWING THE OTHERS TO WEARY
THEMSELVES AND WHEN THE AWKWARD DANCERS HAD WITHDRAWN WE JOINED IN
AND KEPT IT UP FAMOUSLY TOGETHER WITH ONE OTHER COUPLE ANDRAN AND HIS
PARTNER
NEVER DID I DANCE MORE LIGHTLY
I FELT MYSELF MORE THAN MORTAL
HOLDING THIS LOVELIEST OF CREATURES IN MY ARMS FLYING WITH HER AS
RAPIDLY AS THE WIND TILL I LOST SIGHT OF EVERY OTHER OBJECT AND O
WILHELM I VOWED AT THAT MOMENT THAT A MAIDEN WHOM I LOVED OR FOR WHOM
I FELT THE SLIGHTEST ATTACHMENT NEVER NEVER SHOULD WALTZ WITH ANY ONE
ELSE BUT WITH ME IF I WENT TO PERDITION FOR IT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND
THIS
WE TOOK A FEW TURNS IN THE ROOM TO RECOVER OUR BREATH
CHARLOTTE SAT
DOWN AND FELT REFRESHED BY PARTAKING OF SOME ORANGES WHICH I HAD HAD
SECURED THE ONLY ONES THAT HAD BEEN LEFT BUT AT EVERY SLICE WHICH
FROM POLITENESS SHE OFFERED TO HER NEIGHBOURS I FELT AS THOUGH A
DAGGER WENT THROUGH MY HEART
WE WERE THE SECOND COUPLE IN THE THIRD COUNTRY DANCE
AS WE WERE GOING
DOWN AND HEAVEN KNOWS WITH WHAT ECSTASY I GAZED AT HER ARMS AND EYES
BEAMING WITH THE SWEETEST FEELING OF PURE AND GENUINE ENJOYMENT
WE PASSED A LADY WHOM I HAD NOTICED FOR HER CHARMING EXPRESSION OF
COUNTENANCE ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NO LONGER YOUNG
SHE LOOKED AT CHARLOTTE
WITH A SMILE THEN HOLDING UP HER FINGER IN A THREATENING ATTITUDE
REPEATED TWICE IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT TONE OF VOICE THE NAME OF ALBERT
WHO IS ALBERT SAID I TO CHARLOTTE IF IT IS NOT IMPERTINENT TO ASK
SHE WAS ABOUT TO ANSWER WHEN WE WERE OBLIGED TO SEPARATE IN ORDER TO
EXECUTE A FIGURE IN THE DANCE AND AS WE CROSSED OVER AGAIN IN FRONT OF
EACH OTHER I PERCEIVED SHE LOOKED SOMEWHAT PENSIVE
WHY NEED I CONCEAL
IT FROM YOU SHE SAID AS SHE GAVE ME HER HAND FOR THE PROMENADE
ALBERT IS A WORTHY MAN TO WHOM I AM ENGAGED NOW THERE WAS NOTHING
NEW TO ME IN THIS FOR THE GIRLS HAD TOLD ME OF IT ON THE WAY BUT IT
WAS SO FAR NEW THAT I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF IT IN CONNECTION WITH HER WHOM
IN SO SHORT A TIME I HAD LEARNED TO PRIZE SO HIGHLY
ENOUGH I BECAME
CONFUSED GOT OUT IN THE FIGURE AND OCCASIONED GENERAL CONFUSION SO
THAT IT REQUIRED ALL CHARLOTTE'S PRESENCE OF MIND TO SET ME RIGHT BY
PULLING AND PUSHING ME INTO MY PROPER PLACE
THE DANCE WAS NOT YET FINISHED WHEN THE LIGHTNING WHICH HAD FOR SOME
TIME BEEN SEEN IN THE HORIZON AND WHICH I HAD ASSERTED TO PROCEED
ENTIRELY FROM HEAT GREW MORE VIOLENT AND THE THUNDER WAS HEARD ABOVE
THE MUSIC
WHEN ANY DISTRESS OR TERROR SURPRISES US IN THE MIDST OF OUR
AMUSEMENTS IT NATURALLY MAKES A DEEPER IMPRESSION THAN AT OTHER TIMES
EITHER BECAUSE THE CONTRAST MAKES US MORE KEENLY SUSCEPTIBLE OR RATHER
PERHAPS BECAUSE OUR SENSES ARE THEN MORE OPEN TO IMPRESSIONS AND THE
SHOCK IS CONSEQUENTLY STRONGER
TO THIS CAUSE I MUST ASCRIBE THE FRIGHT
AND SHRIEKS OF THE LADIES
ONE SAGACIOUSLY SAT DOWN IN A CORNER WITH
HER BACK TO THE WINDOW AND HELD HER FINGERS TO HER EARS A SECOND KNELT
DOWN BEFORE HER AND HID HER FACE IN HER LAP A THIRD THREW HERSELF
BETWEEN THEM AND EMBRACED HER SISTER WITH A THOUSAND TEARS SOME
INSISTED ON GOING HOME OTHERS UNCONSCIOUS OF THEIR ACTIONS WANTED
SUFFICIENT PRESENCE OF MIND TO REPRESS THE IMPERTINENCE OF THEIR YOUNG
PARTNERS WHO SOUGHT TO DIRECT TO THEMSELVES THOSE SIGHS WHICH THE LIPS
OF OUR AGITATED BEAUTIES INTENDED FOR HEAVEN
SOME OF THE GENTLEMEN HAD
GONE DOWN STAIRS TO SMOKE A QUIET CIGAR AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY
GLADLY EMBRACED A HAPPY SUGGESTION OF THE HOSTESS TO RETIRE INTO ANOTHER
ROOM WHICH WAS PROVIDED WITH SHUTTERS AND CURTAINS
WE HAD HARDLY GOT
THERE WHEN CHARLOTTE PLACED THE CHAIRS IN A CIRCLE AND WHEN THE
COMPANY HAD SAT DOWN IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER REQUEST SHE FORTHWITH
PROPOSED A ROUND GAME
I NOTICED SOME OF THE COMPANY PREPARE THEIR MOUTHS AND DRAW THEMSELVES
UP AT THE PROSPECT OF SOME AGREEABLE FORFEIT
LET US PLAY AT COUNTING
SAID CHARLOTTE
NOW PAY ATTENTION I SHALL GO ROUND THE CIRCLE FROM
RIGHT TO LEFT AND EACH PERSON IS TO COUNT ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE
NUMBER THAT COMES TO HIM AND MUST COUNT FAST WHOEVER STOPS OR
MISTAKES IS TO HAVE A BOX ON THE EAR AND SO ON TILL WE HAVE COUNTED A
THOUSAND IT WAS DELIGHTFUL TO SEE THE FUN
SHE WENT ROUND THE CIRCLE
WITH UPRAISED ARM
ONE SAID THE FIRST TWO THE SECOND THREE
THE THIRD AND SO ON TILL CHARLOTTE WENT FASTER AND FASTER
ONE MADE A
MISTAKE INSTANTLY A BOX ON THE EAR AND AMID THE LAUGHTER THAT ENSUED
CAME ANOTHER BOX AND SO ON FASTER AND FASTER
I MYSELF CAME IN FOR
TWO
I FANCIED THEY WERE HARDER THAN THE REST AND FELT QUITE DELIGHTED
A GENERAL LAUGHTER AND CONFUSION PUT AN END TO THE GAME LONG BEFORE
WE HAD COUNTED AS FAR AS A THOUSAND
THE PARTY BROKE UP INTO LITTLE
SEPARATE KNOTS THE STORM HAD CEASED AND I FOLLOWED CHARLOTTE INTO THE
BALLROOM
ON THE WAY SHE SAID THE GAME BANISHED THEIR FEARS OF THE
STORM I COULD MAKE NO REPLY
I MYSELF SHE CONTINUED WAS AS MUCH
FRIGHTENED AS ANY OF THEM BUT BY AFFECTING COURAGE TO KEEP UP THE
SPIRITS OF THE OTHERS I FORGOT MY APPREHENSIONS WE WENT TO THE
WINDOW
IT WAS STILL THUNDERING AT A DISTANCE A SOFT RAIN WAS POURING
DOWN OVER THE COUNTRY AND FILLED THE AIR AROUND US WITH DELICIOUS
ODOURS
CHARLOTTE LEANED FORWARD ON HER ARM HER EYES WANDERED OVER THE
SCENE SHE RAISED THEM TO THE SKY AND THEN TURNED THEM UPON ME
THEY WERE MOISTENED WITH TEARS SHE PLACED HER HAND ON MINE AND SAID
KLOPSTOCK AT ONCE I REMEMBERED THE MAGNIFICENT ODE WHICH WAS IN HER
THOUGHTS I FELT OPPRESSED WITH THE WEIGHT OF MY SENSATIONS AND SANK
UNDER THEM
IT WAS MORE THAN I COULD BEAR
I BENT OVER HER HAND KISSED
IT IN A STREAM OF DELICIOUS TEARS AND AGAIN LOOKED UP TO HER EYES
DIVINE KLOPSTOCK WHY DIDST THOU NOT SEE THY APOTHEOSIS IN THOSE EYES
AND THY NAME SO OFTEN PROFANED WOULD THAT I NEVER HEARD IT REPEATED
JUNE 19
I NO LONGER REMEMBER WHERE I STOPPED IN MY NARRATIVE I ONLY KNOW IT WAS
TWO IN THE MORNING WHEN I WENT TO BED AND IF YOU HAD BEEN WITH ME
THAT I MIGHT HAVE TALKED INSTEAD OF WRITING TO YOU I SHOULD IN ALL
PROBABILITY HAVE KEPT YOU UP TILL DAYLIGHT
I THINK I HAVE NOT YET RELATED WHAT HAPPENED AS WE RODE HOME FROM
THE BALL NOR HAVE I TIME TO TELL YOU NOW
IT WAS A MOST MAGNIFICENT
SUNRISE THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS REFRESHED AND THE RAIN FELL DROP BY
DROP FROM THE TREES IN THE FOREST
OUR COMPANIONS WERE ASLEEP
CHARLOTTE
ASKED ME IF I DID NOT WISH TO SLEEP ALSO AND BEGGED OF ME NOT TO MAKE
ANY CEREMONY ON HER ACCOUNT
LOOKING STEADFASTLY AT HER I ANSWERED AS
LONG AS I SEE THOSE EYES OPEN THERE IS NO FEAR OF MY FALLING ASLEEP
WE BOTH CONTINUED AWAKE TILL WE REACHED HER DOOR
THE MAID OPENED IT
SOFTLY AND ASSURED HER IN ANSWER TO HER INQUIRIES THAT HER FATHER AND
THE CHILDREN WERE WELL AND STILL SLEEPING
I LEFT HER ASKING PERMISSION
TO VISIT HER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY
SHE CONSENTED AND I WENT AND
SINCE THAT TIME SUN MOON AND STARS MAY PURSUE THEIR COURSE I KNOW
NOT WHETHER IT IS DAY OR NIGHT THE WHOLE WORLD IS NOTHING TO ME
JUNE 21
MY DAYS ARE AS HAPPY AS THOSE RESERVED BY GOD FOR HIS ELECT AND
WHATEVER BE MY FATE HEREAFTER I CAN NEVER SAY THAT I HAVE NOT TASTED
JOY THE PUREST JOY OF LIFE
YOU KNOW WALHEIM
I AM NOW COMPLETELY
SETTLED THERE
IN THAT SPOT I AM ONLY HALF A LEAGUE FROM CHARLOTTE AND
THERE I ENJOY MYSELF AND TASTE ALL THE PLEASURE WHICH CAN FALL TO THE
LOT OF MAN
LITTLE DID I IMAGINE WHEN I SELECTED WALHEIM FOR MY PEDESTRIAN
EXCURSIONS THAT ALL HEAVEN LAY SO NEAR IT
HOW OFTEN IN MY WANDERINGS
FROM THE HILLSIDE OR FROM THE MEADOWS ACROSS THE RIVER HAVE I BEHELD
THIS HUNTING LODGE WHICH NOW CONTAINS WITHIN IT ALL THE JOY OF MY
HEART
I HAVE OFTEN MY DEAR WILHELM REFLECTED ON THE EAGERNESS MEN FEEL TO
WANDER AND MAKE NEW DISCOVERIES AND UPON THAT SECRET IMPULSE WHICH
AFTERWARD INCLINES THEM TO RETURN TO THEIR NARROW CIRCLE CONFORM TO
THE LAWS OF CUSTOM AND EMBARRASS THEMSELVES NO LONGER WITH WHAT PASSES
AROUND THEM
IT IS SO STRANGE HOW WHEN I CAME HERE FIRST AND GAZED UPON THAT
LOVELY VALLEY FROM THE HILLSIDE I FELT CHARMED WITH THE ENTIRE SCENE
SURROUNDING ME
THE LITTLE WOOD OPPOSITE HOW DELIGHTFUL TO SIT UNDER
ITS SHADE HOW FINE THE VIEW FROM THAT POINT OF ROCK THEN THAT
DELIGHTFUL CHAIN OF HILLS AND THE EXQUISITE VALLEYS AT THEIR FEET
COULD I BUT WANDER AND LOSE MYSELF AMONGST THEM I WENT AND RETURNED
WITHOUT FINDING WHAT I WISHED
DISTANCE MY FRIEND IS LIKE FUTURITY
A
DIM VASTNESS IS SPREAD BEFORE OUR SOULS THE PERCEPTIONS OF OUR MIND ARE
AS OBSCURE AS THOSE OF OUR VISION AND WE DESIRE EARNESTLY TO SURRENDER
UP OUR WHOLE BEING THAT IT MAY BE FILLED WITH THE COMPLETE AND PERFECT
BLISS OF ONE GLORIOUS EMOTION
BUT ALAS WHEN WE HAVE ATTAINED OUR
OBJECT WHEN THE DISTANT THERE BECOMES THE PRESENT HERE ALL IS CHANGED
WE ARE AS POOR AND CIRCUMSCRIBED AS EVER AND OUR SOULS STILL LANGUISH
FOR UNATTAINABLE HAPPINESS
SO DOES THE RESTLESS TRAVELLER PANT FOR HIS NATIVE SOIL AND FIND IN HIS
OWN COTTAGE IN THE ARMS OF HIS WIFE IN THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS CHILDREN
AND IN THE LABOUR NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUPPORT THAT HAPPINESS WHICH HE
HAD SOUGHT IN VAIN THROUGH THE WIDE WORLD
WHEN IN THE MORNING AT SUNRISE I GO OUT TO WALHEIM AND WITH MY OWN
HANDS GATHER IN THE GARDEN THE PEASE WHICH ARE TO SERVE FOR MY DINNER
WHEN I SIT DOWN TO SHELL THEM AND READ MY HOMER DURING THE INTERVALS
AND THEN SELECTING A SAUCEPAN FROM THE KITCHEN FETCH MY OWN BUTTER
PUT MY MESS ON THE FIRE COVER IT UP AND SIT DOWN TO STIR IT AS
OCCASION REQUIRES I FIGURE TO MYSELF THE ILLUSTRIOUS SUITORS OF
PENELOPE KILLING DRESSING AND PREPARING THEIR OWN OXEN AND SWINE
NOTHING FILLS ME WITH A MORE PURE AND GENUINE SENSE OF HAPPINESS THAN
THOSE TRAITS OF PATRIARCHAL LIFE WHICH THANK HEAVEN I CAN IMITATE
WITHOUT AFFECTATION
HAPPY IS IT INDEED FOR ME THAT MY HEART IS
CAPABLE OF FEELING THE SAME SIMPLE AND INNOCENT PLEASURE AS THE PEASANT
WHOSE TABLE IS COVERED WITH FOOD OF HIS OWN REARING AND WHO NOT ONLY
ENJOYS HIS MEAL BUT REMEMBERS WITH DELIGHT THE HAPPY DAYS AND SUNNY
MORNINGS WHEN HE PLANTED IT THE SOFT EVENINGS WHEN HE WATERED IT AND
THE PLEASURE HE EXPERIENCED IN WATCHING ITS DAILY GROWTH
JUNE 29
THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY THE PHYSICIAN CAME FROM THE TOWN TO PAY A
VISIT TO THE JUDGE
HE FOUND ME ON THE FLOOR PLAYING WITH CHARLOTTE'S
CHILDREN
SOME OF THEM WERE SCRAMBLING OVER ME AND OTHERS ROMPED WITH
ME AND AS I CAUGHT AND TICKLED THEM THEY MADE A GREAT NOISE
THE
DOCTOR IS A FORMAL SORT OF PERSONAGE HE ADJUSTS THE PLAITS OF HIS
RUFFLES AND CONTINUALLY SETTLES HIS FRILL WHILST HE IS TALKING TO YOU
AND HE THOUGHT MY CONDUCT BENEATH THE DIGNITY OF A SENSIBLE MAN
I COULD
PERCEIVE THIS BY HIS COUNTENANCE
BUT I DID NOT SUFFER MYSELF TO BE
DISTURBED
I ALLOWED HIM TO CONTINUE HIS WISE CONVERSATION WHILST I
REBUILT THE CHILDREN'S CARD HOUSES FOR THEM AS FAST AS THEY THREW THEM
DOWN
HE WENT ABOUT THE TOWN AFTERWARD COMPLAINING THAT THE JUDGE'S
CHILDREN WERE SPOILED ENOUGH BEFORE BUT THAT NOW WERTHER WAS COMPLETELY
RUINING THEM
YES MY DEAR WILHELM NOTHING ON THIS EARTH AFFECTS MY HEART SO MUCH
AS CHILDREN
WHEN I LOOK ON AT THEIR DOINGS WHEN I MARK IN THE LITTLE
CREATURES THE SEEDS OF ALL THOSE VIRTUES AND QUALITIES WHICH THEY WILL
ONE DAY FIND SO INDISPENSABLE WHEN I BEHOLD IN THE OBSTINATE ALL THE
FUTURE FIRMNESS AND CONSTANCY OF A NOBLE CHARACTER IN THE CAPRICIOUS
THAT LEVITY AND GAIETY OF TEMPER WHICH WILL CARRY THEM LIGHTLY OVER
THE DANGERS AND TROUBLES OF LIFE THEIR WHOLE NATURE SIMPLE AND
UNPOLLUTED THEN I CALL TO MIND THE GOLDEN WORDS OF THE GREAT TEACHER
OF MANKIND UNLESS YE BECOME LIKE ONE OF THESE AND NOW MY FRIEND
THESE CHILDREN WHO ARE OUR EQUALS WHOM WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER AS OUR
MODELS WE TREAT THEM AS THOUGH THEY WERE OUR SUBJECTS
THEY ARE ALLOWED
NO WILL OF THEIR OWN
AND HAVE WE THEN NONE OURSELVES WHENCE COMES
OUR EXCLUSIVE RIGHT IS IT BECAUSE WE ARE OLDER AND MORE EXPERIENCED
GREAT GOD FROM THE HEIGHT OF THY HEAVEN THOU BEHOLDEST GREAT CHILDREN
AND LITTLE CHILDREN AND NO OTHERS AND THY SON HAS LONG SINCE DECLARED
WHICH AFFORD THEE GREATEST PLEASURE
BUT THEY BELIEVE IN HIM AND HEAR
HIM NOT THAT TOO IS AN OLD STORY AND THEY TRAIN THEIR CHILDREN
AFTER THEIR OWN IMAGE ETC
ADIEU WILHELM I WILL NOT FURTHER BEWILDER MYSELF WITH THIS SUBJECT
JULY 1
THE CONSOLATION CHARLOTTE CAN BRING TO AN INVALID I EXPERIENCE FROM MY
OWN HEART WHICH SUFFERS MORE FROM HER ABSENCE THAN MANY A POOR CREATURE
LINGERING ON A BED OF SICKNESS
SHE IS GONE TO SPEND A FEW DAYS IN THE
TOWN WITH A VERY WORTHY WOMAN WHO IS GIVEN OVER BY THE PHYSICIANS AND
WISHES TO HAVE CHARLOTTE NEAR HER IN HER LAST MOMENTS
I ACCOMPANIED
HER LAST WEEK ON A VISIT TO THE VICAR OF S A SMALL VILLAGE IN
THE MOUNTAINS ABOUT A LEAGUE HENCE
WE ARRIVED ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK
CHARLOTTE HAD TAKEN HER LITTLE SISTER WITH HER
WHEN WE ENTERED THE
VICARAGE COURT WE FOUND THE GOOD OLD MAN SITTING ON A BENCH BEFORE
THE DOOR UNDER THE SHADE OF TWO LARGE WALNUT TREES
AT THE SIGHT
OF CHARLOTTE HE SEEMED TO GAIN NEW LIFE ROSE FORGOT HIS STICK AND
VENTURED TO WALK TOWARD HER
SHE RAN TO HIM AND MADE HIM SIT DOWN
AGAIN THEN PLACING HERSELF BY HIS SIDE SHE GAVE HIM A NUMBER OF
MESSAGES FROM HER FATHER AND THEN CAUGHT UP HIS YOUNGEST CHILD A
DIRTY UGLY LITTLE THING THE JOY OF HIS OLD AGE AND KISSED IT
I WISH
YOU COULD HAVE WITNESSED HER ATTENTION TO THIS OLD MAN HOW SHE RAISED
HER VOICE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS DEAFNESS HOW SHE TOLD HIM OF HEALTHY YOUNG
PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF WHEN IT WAS LEAST EXPECTED PRAISED
THE VIRTUES OF CARLSBAD AND COMMENDED HIS DETERMINATION TO SPEND THE
ENSUING SUMMER THERE AND ASSURED HIM THAT HE LOOKED BETTER AND STRONGER
THAN HE DID WHEN SHE SAW HIM LAST
I IN THE MEANTIME PAID ATTENTION TO
HIS GOOD LADY
THE OLD MAN SEEMED QUITE IN SPIRITS AND AS I COULD
NOT HELP ADMIRING THE BEAUTY OF THE WALNUT TREES WHICH FORMED SUCH
AN AGREEABLE SHADE OVER OUR HEADS HE BEGAN THOUGH WITH SOME LITTLE
DIFFICULTY TO TELL US THEIR HISTORY
AS TO THE OLDEST SAID HE WE
DO NOT KNOW WHO PLANTED IT SOME SAY ONE CLERGYMAN AND SOME ANOTHER
BUT THE YOUNGER ONE THERE BEHIND US IS EXACTLY THE AGE OF MY WIFE
FIFTY YEARS OLD NEXT OCTOBER HER FATHER PLANTED IT IN THE MORNING
AND IN THE EVENING SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD
MY WIFE'S FATHER WAS MY
PREDECESSOR HERE AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW FOND HE WAS OF THAT TREE
AND IT IS FULLY AS DEAR TO ME
UNDER THE SHADE OF THAT VERY TREE UPON
A LOG OF WOOD MY WIFE WAS SEATED KNITTING WHEN I A POOR STUDENT CAME
INTO THIS COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME JUST SEVEN AND TWENTY YEARS AGO
CHARLOTTE INQUIRED FOR HIS DAUGHTER
HE SAID SHE WAS GONE WITH HERR
SCHMIDT TO THE MEADOWS AND WAS WITH THE HAYMAKERS
THE OLD MAN THEN
RESUMED HIS STORY AND TOLD US HOW HIS PREDECESSOR HAD TAKEN A FANCY
TO HIM AS HAD HIS DAUGHTER LIKEWISE AND HOW HE HAD BECOME FIRST HIS
CURATE AND SUBSEQUENTLY HIS SUCCESSOR
HE HAD SCARCELY FINISHED HIS
STORY WHEN HIS DAUGHTER RETURNED THROUGH THE GARDEN ACCOMPANIED BY THE
ABOVE MENTIONED HERR SCHMIDT
SHE WELCOMED CHARLOTTE AFFECTIONATELY
AND I CONFESS I WAS MUCH TAKEN WITH HER APPEARANCE
SHE WAS A
LIVELY LOOKING GOOD HUMOURED BRUNETTE QUITE COMPETENT TO AMUSE ONE FOR
A SHORT TIME IN THE COUNTRY
HER LOVER FOR SUCH HERR SCHMIDT EVIDENTLY
APPEARED TO BE WAS A POLITE RESERVED PERSONAGE AND WOULD NOT JOIN
OUR CONVERSATION NOTWITHSTANDING ALL CHARLOTTE'S ENDEAVOURS TO DRAW
HIM OUT
I WAS MUCH ANNOYED AT OBSERVING BY HIS COUNTENANCE THAT
HIS SILENCE DID NOT ARISE FROM WANT OF TALENT BUT FROM CAPRICE AND
ILL HUMOUR
THIS SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME VERY EVIDENT WHEN WE SET OUT TO
TAKE A WALK AND FREDERICA JOINING CHARLOTTE WITH WHOM I WAS TALKING
THE WORTHY GENTLEMAN'S FACE WHICH WAS NATURALLY RATHER SOMBRE BECAME
SO DARK AND ANGRY THAT CHARLOTTE WAS OBLIGED TO TOUCH MY ARM AND REMIND
ME THAT I WAS TALKING TOO MUCH TO FREDERICA
NOTHING DISTRESSES ME MORE
THAN TO SEE MEN TORMENT EACH OTHER PARTICULARLY WHEN IN THE FLOWER OF
THEIR AGE IN THE VERY SEASON OF PLEASURE THEY WASTE THEIR FEW SHORT
DAYS OF SUNSHINE IN QUARRELS AND DISPUTES AND ONLY PERCEIVE THEIR ERROR
WHEN IT IS TOO LATE TO REPAIR IT
THIS THOUGHT DWELT UPON MY MIND AND
IN THE EVENING WHEN WE RETURNED TO THE VICAR'S AND WERE SITTING ROUND
THE TABLE WITH OUR BREAD END MILK THE CONVERSATION TURNED ON THE JOYS
AND SORROWS OF THE WORLD I COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO INVEIGH
BITTERLY AGAINST ILL HUMOUR
WE ARE APT SAID I TO COMPLAIN
BUT WITH VERY LITTLE CAUSE THAT OUR HAPPY DAYS ARE FEW AND OUR EVIL
DAYS MANY
IF OUR HEARTS WERE ALWAYS DISPOSED TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS
HEAVEN SENDS US WE SHOULD ACQUIRE STRENGTH TO SUPPORT EVIL WHEN IT
COMES BUT OBSERVED THE VICAR'S WIFE WE CANNOT ALWAYS COMMAND OUR
TEMPERS SO MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE CONSTITUTION WHEN THE BODY SUFFERS
THE MIND IS ILL AT EASE I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I CONTINUED BUT WE
MUST CONSIDER SUCH A DISPOSITION IN THE LIGHT OF A DISEASE AND INQUIRE
WHETHER THERE IS NO REMEDY FOR IT
I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR ONE SAID CHARLOTTE AT LEAST I THINK VERY
MUCH DEPENDS UPON OURSELVES I KNOW IT IS SO WITH ME
WHEN ANYTHING
ANNOYS ME AND DISTURBS MY TEMPER I HASTEN INTO THE GARDEN HUM A
COUPLE OF COUNTRY DANCES AND IT IS ALL RIGHT WITH ME DIRECTLY THAT
IS WHAT I MEANT I REPLIED ILL HUMOUR RESEMBLES INDOLENCE IT IS
NATURAL TO US BUT IF ONCE WE HAVE COURAGE TO EXERT OURSELVES WE FIND
OUR WORK RUN FRESH FROM OUR HANDS AND WE EXPERIENCE IN THE ACTIVITY
FROM WHICH WE SHRANK A REAL ENJOYMENT FREDERICA LISTENED VERY
ATTENTIVELY AND THE YOUNG MAN OBJECTED THAT WE WERE NOT MASTERS OF
OURSELVES AND STILL LESS SO OF OUR FEELINGS
THE QUESTION IS ABOUT A
DISAGREEABLE FEELING I ADDED FROM WHICH EVERY ONE WOULD WILLINGLY
ESCAPE BUT NONE KNOW THEIR OWN POWER WITHOUT TRIAL
INVALIDS ARE GLAD
TO CONSULT PHYSICIANS AND SUBMIT TO THE MOST SCRUPULOUS REGIMEN THE
MOST NAUSEOUS MEDICINES IN ORDER TO RECOVER THEIR HEALTH I OBSERVED
THAT THE GOOD OLD MAN INCLINED HIS HEAD AND EXERTED HIMSELF TO HEAR OUR
DISCOURSE SO I RAISED MY VOICE AND ADDRESSED MYSELF DIRECTLY TO
HIM
WE PREACH AGAINST A GREAT MANY CRIMES I OBSERVED BUT I NEVER
REMEMBER A SERMON DELIVERED AGAINST ILL HUMOUR THAT MAY DO VERY
WELL FOR YOUR TOWN CLERGYMEN SAID HE COUNTRY PEOPLE ARE NEVER
ILL HUMOURED THOUGH INDEED IT MIGHT BE USEFUL OCCASIONALLY TO MY
WIFE FOR INSTANCE AND THE JUDGE WE ALL LAUGHED AS DID HE LIKEWISE
VERY CORDIALLY TILL HE FELL INTO A FIT OF COUGHING WHICH INTERRUPTED
OUR CONVERSATION FOR A TIME
HERR SCHMIDT RESUMED THE SUBJECT
YOU
CALL ILL HUMOUR A CRIME HE REMARKED BUT I THINK YOU USE TOO STRONG
A TERM NOT AT ALL I REPLIED IF THAT DESERVES THE NAME WHICH IS
SO PERNICIOUS TO OURSELVES AND OUR NEIGHBOURS
IS IT NOT ENOUGH THAT WE
WANT THE POWER TO MAKE ONE ANOTHER HAPPY MUST WE DEPRIVE EACH OTHER OF
THE PLEASURE WHICH WE CAN ALL MAKE FOR OURSELVES SHOW ME THE MAN WHO
HAS THE COURAGE TO HIDE HIS ILL HUMOUR WHO BEARS THE WHOLE BURDEN
HIMSELF WITHOUT DISTURBING THE PEACE OF THOSE AROUND HIM
NO
ILL HUMOUR ARISES FROM AN INWARD CONSCIOUSNESS OF OUR OWN WANT OF MERIT
FROM A DISCONTENT WHICH EVER ACCOMPANIES THAT ENVY WHICH FOOLISH VANITY
ENGENDERS
WE SEE PEOPLE HAPPY WHOM WE HAVE NOT MADE SO AND CANNOT
ENDURE THE SIGHT CHARLOTTE LOOKED AT ME WITH A SMILE SHE OBSERVED
THE EMOTION WITH WHICH I SPOKE AND A TEAR IN THE EYES OF FREDERICA
STIMULATED ME TO PROCEED
WOE UNTO THOSE I SAID WHO USE THEIR POWER
OVER A HUMAN HEART TO DESTROY THE SIMPLE PLEASURES IT WOULD NATURALLY
ENJOY ALL THE FAVOURS ALL THE ATTENTIONS IN THE WORLD CANNOT
COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS OF THAT HAPPINESS WHICH A CRUEL TYRANNY HAS
DESTROYED MY HEART WAS FULL AS I SPOKE
A RECOLLECTION OF MANY THINGS
WHICH HAD HAPPENED PRESSED UPON MY MIND AND FILLED MY EYES WITH TEARS
WE SHOULD DAILY REPEAT TO OURSELVES I EXCLAIMED THAT WE SHOULD NOT
INTERFERE WITH OUR FRIENDS UNLESS TO LEAVE THEM IN POSSESSION OF THEIR
OWN JOYS AND INCREASE THEIR HAPPINESS BY SHARING IT WITH THEM BUT WHEN
THEIR SOULS ARE TORMENTED BY A VIOLENT PASSION OR THEIR HEARTS
RENT WITH GRIEF IS IT IN YOUR POWER TO AFFORD THEM THE SLIGHTEST
CONSOLATION
AND WHEN THE LAST FATAL MALADY SEIZES THE BEING WHOSE UNTIMELY GRAVE
YOU HAVE PREPARED WHEN SHE LIES LANGUID AND EXHAUSTED BEFORE YOU HER
DIM EYES RAISED TO HEAVEN AND THE DAMP OF DEATH UPON HER PALLID BROW
THERE YOU STAND AT HER BEDSIDE LIKE A CONDEMNED CRIMINAL WITH THE
BITTER FEELING THAT YOUR WHOLE FORTUNE COULD NOT SAVE HER AND THE
AGONISING THOUGHT WRINGS YOU THAT ALL YOUR EFFORTS ARE POWERLESS TO
IMPART EVEN A MOMENT'S STRENGTH TO THE DEPARTING SOUL OR QUICKEN HER
WITH A TRANSITORY CONSOLATION
AT THESE WORDS THE REMEMBRANCE OF A SIMILAR SCENE AT WHICH I HAD BEEN
ONCE PRESENT FELL WITH FULL FORCE UPON MY HEART
I BURIED MY FACE IN MY
HANDKERCHIEF AND HASTENED FROM THE ROOM AND WAS ONLY RECALLED TO MY
RECOLLECTION BY CHARLOTTE'S VOICE WHO REMINDED ME THAT IT WAS TIME TO
RETURN HOME
WITH WHAT TENDERNESS SHE CHID ME ON THE WAY FOR THE TOO
EAGER INTEREST I TOOK IN EVERYTHING SHE DECLARED IT WOULD DO ME INJURY
AND THAT I OUGHT TO SPARE MYSELF
YES MY ANGEL I WILL DO SO FOR YOUR
SAKE
JULY 6
SHE IS STILL WITH HER DYING FRIEND AND IS STILL THE SAME BRIGHT
BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WHOSE PRESENCE SOFTENS PAIN AND SHEDS HAPPINESS
AROUND WHICHEVER WAY SHE TURNS
SHE WENT OUT YESTERDAY WITH HER LITTLE
SISTERS I KNEW IT AND WENT TO MEET THEM AND WE WALKED TOGETHER
IN
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF WE RETURNED TO THE TOWN
WE STOPPED AT THE
SPRING I AM SO FOND OF AND WHICH IS NOW A THOUSAND TIMES DEARER TO ME
THAN EVER
CHARLOTTE SEATED HERSELF UPON THE LOW WALL AND WE GATHERED
ABOUT HER
I LOOKED AROUND AND RECALLED THE TIME WHEN MY HEART WAS
UNOCCUPIED AND FREE
DEAR FOUNTAIN I SAID SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE NO
MORE COME TO ENJOY COOL REPOSE BY THY FRESH STREAM I HAVE PASSED THEE
WITH CARELESS STEPS AND SCARCELY BESTOWED A GLANCE UPON THEE I LOOKED
DOWN AND OBSERVED CHARLOTTE'S LITTLE SISTER JANE COMING UP THE
STEPS WITH A GLASS OF WATER
I TURNED TOWARD CHARLOTTE AND I FELT HER
INFLUENCE OVER ME
JANE AT THE MOMENT APPROACHED WITH THE GLASS
HER
SISTER MARIANNE WISHED TO TAKE IT FROM HER
NO CRIED THE CHILD
WITH THE SWEETEST EXPRESSION OF FACE CHARLOTTE MUST DRINK FIRST
THE AFFECTION AND SIMPLICITY WITH WHICH THIS WAS UTTERED SO CHARMED
ME THAT I SOUGHT TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS BY CATCHING UP THE CHILD AND
KISSING HER HEARTILY
SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AND BEGAN TO CRY
YOU SHOULD
NOT DO THAT SAID CHARLOTTE I FELT PERPLEXED
COME JANE SHE
CONTINUED TAKING HER HAND AND LEADING HER DOWN THE STEPS AGAIN IT
IS NO MATTER WASH YOURSELF QUICKLY IN THE FRESH WATER I STOOD AND
WATCHED THEM AND WHEN I SAW THE LITTLE DEAR RUBBING HER CHEEKS WITH
HER WET HANDS IN FULL BELIEF THAT ALL THE IMPURITIES CONTRACTED FROM MY
UGLY BEARD WOULD BE WASHED OFF BY THE MIRACULOUS WATER AND HOW THOUGH
CHARLOTTE SAID IT WOULD DO SHE CONTINUED STILL TO WASH WITH ALL HER
MIGHT AS THOUGH SHE THOUGHT TOO MUCH WERE BETTER THAN TOO LITTLE I
ASSURE YOU WILHELM I NEVER ATTENDED A BAPTISM WITH GREATER REVERENCE
AND WHEN CHARLOTTE CAME UP FROM THE WELL I COULD HAVE PROSTRATED
MYSELF AS BEFORE THE PROPHET OF AN EASTERN NATION
IN THE EVENING I WOULD NOT RESIST TELLING THE STORY TO A PERSON WHO
I THOUGHT POSSESSED SOME NATURAL FEELING BECAUSE HE WAS A MAN OF
UNDERSTANDING
BUT WHAT A MISTAKE I MADE
HE MAINTAINED IT WAS VERY
WRONG OF CHARLOTTE THAT WE SHOULD NOT DECEIVE CHILDREN THAT SUCH
THINGS OCCASIONED COUNTLESS MISTAKES AND SUPERSTITIONS FROM WHICH WE
WERE BOUND TO PROTECT THE YOUNG
IT OCCURRED TO ME THEN THAT THIS VERY
MAN HAD BEEN BAPTISED ONLY A WEEK BEFORE SO I SAID NOTHING FURTHER
BUT MAINTAINED THE JUSTICE OF MY OWN CONVICTIONS
WE SHOULD DEAL WITH
CHILDREN AS GOD DEALS WITH US WE ARE HAPPIEST UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
INNOCENT DELUSIONS
JULY 8
WHAT A CHILD IS MAN THAT HE SHOULD BE SO SOLICITOUS ABOUT A LOOK WHAT A
CHILD IS MAN WE HAD BEEN TO WALHEIM THE LADIES WENT IN A CARRIAGE
BUT DURING OUR WALK I THOUGHT I SAW IN CHARLOTTE'S DARK EYES I AM A
FOOL BUT FORGIVE ME YOU SHOULD SEE THEM THOSE EYES HOWEVER TO BE
BRIEF FOR MY OWN EYES ARE WEIGHED DOWN WITH SLEEP YOU MUST KNOW
WHEN THE LADIES STEPPED INTO THEIR CARRIAGE AGAIN YOUNG W
SELDSTADT
ANDRAN AND I WERE STANDING ABOUT THE DOOR
THEY ARE A MERRY SET OF
FELLOWS AND THEY WERE ALL LAUGHING AND JOKING TOGETHER
I WATCHED
CHARLOTTE'S EYES
THEY WANDERED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT THEY DID NOT
LIGHT ON ME ON ME WHO STOOD THERE MOTIONLESS AND WHO SAW NOTHING BUT
HER MY HEART BADE HER A THOUSAND TIMES ADIEU BUT SHE NOTICED ME NOT
THE CARRIAGE DROVE OFF AND MY EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
I LOOKED AFTER
HER SUDDENLY I SAW CHARLOTTE'S BONNET LEANING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND
SHE TURNED TO LOOK BACK WAS IT AT ME MY DEAR FRIEND I KNOW NOT AND
IN THIS UNCERTAINTY I FIND CONSOLATION
PERHAPS SHE TURNED TO LOOK AT
ME
PERHAPS GOOD NIGHT WHAT A CHILD I AM
JULY 10
YOU SHOULD SEE HOW FOOLISH I LOOK IN COMPANY WHEN HER NAME IS MENTIONED
PARTICULARLY WHEN I AM ASKED PLAINLY HOW I LIKE HER
HOW I LIKE HER
I DETEST THE PHRASE
WHAT SORT OF CREATURE MUST HE BE WHO MERELY LIKED
CHARLOTTE WHOSE WHOLE HEART AND SENSES WERE NOT ENTIRELY ABSORBED BY
HER
LIKE HER SOME ONE ASKED ME LATELY HOW I LIKED OSSIAN
JULY 11
MADAME M IS VERY ILL
I PRAY FOR HER RECOVERY BECAUSE CHARLOTTE SHARES
MY SUFFERINGS
I SEE HER OCCASIONALLY AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE AND TO DAY
SHE HAS TOLD ME THE STRANGEST CIRCUMSTANCE
OLD M IS A COVETOUS
MISERLY FELLOW WHO HAS LONG WORRIED AND ANNOYED THE POOR LADY SADLY
BUT SHE HAS BORNE HER AFFLICTIONS PATIENTLY
A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN THE
PHYSICIAN INFORMED US THAT HER RECOVERY WAS HOPELESS SHE SENT FOR
HER HUSBAND CHARLOTTE WAS PRESENT AND ADDRESSED HIM THUS I HAVE
SOMETHING TO CONFESS WHICH AFTER MY DECEASE MAY OCCASION TROUBLE
AND CONFUSION
I HAVE HITHERTO CONDUCTED YOUR HOUSEHOLD AS FRUGALLY AND
ECONOMICALLY AS POSSIBLE BUT YOU MUST PARDON ME FOR HAVING DEFRAUDED
YOU FOR THIRTY YEARS
AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF OUR MARRIED LIFE YOU
ALLOWED A SMALL SUM FOR THE WANTS OF THE KITCHEN AND THE OTHER
HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES
WHEN OUR ESTABLISHMENT INCREASED AND OUR PROPERTY
GREW LARGER I COULD NOT PERSUADE YOU TO INCREASE THE WEEKLY ALLOWANCE
IN PROPORTION IN SHORT YOU KNOW THAT WHEN OUR WANTS WERE GREATEST
YOU REQUIRED ME TO SUPPLY EVERYTHING WITH SEVEN FLORINS A WEEK
I
TOOK THE MONEY FROM YOU WITHOUT AN OBSERVATION BUT MADE UP THE WEEKLY
DEFICIENCY FROM THE MONEY CHEST AS NOBODY WOULD SUSPECT YOUR WIFE OF
ROBBING THE HOUSEHOLD BANK
BUT I HAVE WASTED NOTHING AND SHOULD HAVE
BEEN CONTENT TO MEET MY ETERNAL JUDGE WITHOUT THIS CONFESSION IF SHE
UPON WHOM THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR ESTABLISHMENT WILL DEVOLVE AFTER MY
DECEASE WOULD BE FREE FROM EMBARRASSMENT UPON YOUR INSISTING THAT THE
ALLOWANCE MADE TO ME YOUR FORMER WIFE WAS SUFFICIENT
I TALKED WITH CHARLOTTE OF THE INCONCEIVABLE MANNER IN WHICH MEN ALLOW
THEMSELVES TO BE BLINDED HOW ANY ONE COULD AVOID SUSPECTING SOME
DECEPTION WHEN SEVEN FLORINS ONLY WERE ALLOWED TO DEFRAY EXPENSES
TWICE AS GREAT
BUT I HAVE MYSELF KNOWN PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED WITHOUT
ANY VISIBLE ASTONISHMENT THAT THEIR HOUSE POSSESSED THE PROPHET'S
NEVER FAILING CRUSE OF OIL
JULY 13
NO I AM NOT DECEIVED
IN HER DARK EYES I READ A GENUINE INTEREST IN ME
AND IN MY FORTUNES
YES I FEEL IT AND I MAY BELIEVE MY OWN HEART WHICH
TELLS ME DARE I SAY IT DARE I PRONOUNCE THE DIVINE WORDS THAT SHE
LOVES ME
THAT SHE LOVES ME HOW THE IDEA EXALTS ME IN MY OWN EYES AND AS YOU
CAN UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS I MAY SAY TO YOU HOW I HONOUR MYSELF SINCE
SHE LOVES ME
IS THIS PRESUMPTION OR IS IT A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE TRUTH I DO NOT
KNOW A MAN ABLE TO SUPPLANT ME IN THE HEART OF CHARLOTTE AND YET WHEN
SHE SPEAKS OF HER BETROTHED WITH SO MUCH WARMTH AND AFFECTION I FEEL
LIKE THE SOLDIER WHO HAS BEEN STRIPPED OF HIS HONOURS AND TITLES AND
DEPRIVED OF HIS SWORD
JULY 16
HOW MY HEART BEATS WHEN BY ACCIDENT I TOUCH HER FINGER OR MY FEET MEET
HERS UNDER THE TABLE I DRAW BACK AS IF FROM A FURNACE BUT A SECRET
FORCE IMPELS ME FORWARD AGAIN AND MY SENSES BECOME DISORDERED
HER INNOCENT UNCONSCIOUS HEART NEVER KNOWS WHAT AGONY THESE LITTLE
FAMILIARITIES INFLICT UPON ME
SOMETIMES WHEN WE ARE TALKING SHE LAYS
HER HAND UPON MINE AND IN THE EAGERNESS OF CONVERSATION COMES CLOSER TO
ME AND HER BALMY BREATH REACHES MY LIPS WHEN I FEEL AS IF LIGHTNING
HAD STRUCK ME AND THAT I COULD SINK INTO THE EARTH
AND YET WILHELM
WITH ALL THIS HEAVENLY CONFIDENCE IF I KNOW MYSELF AND SHOULD EVER
DARE YOU UNDERSTAND ME
NO NO MY HEART IS NOT SO CORRUPT IT IS WEAK
WEAK ENOUGH BUT IS NOT THAT A DEGREE OF CORRUPTION
SHE IS TO ME A SACRED BEING
ALL PASSION IS STILL IN HER PRESENCE I
CANNOT EXPRESS MY SENSATIONS WHEN I AM NEAR HER
I FEEL AS IF MY SOUL
BEAT IN EVERY NERVE OF MY BODY
THERE IS A MELODY WHICH SHE PLAYS ON THE
PIANO WITH ANGELIC SKILL SO SIMPLE IS IT AND YET SO SPIRITUAL IT IS
HER FAVOURITE AIR AND WHEN SHE PLAYS THE FIRST NOTE ALL PAIN CARE
AND SORROW DISAPPEAR FROM ME IN A MOMENT
I BELIEVE EVERY WORD THAT IS SAID OF THE MAGIC OF ANCIENT MUSIC
HOW HER
SIMPLE SONG ENCHANTS ME SOMETIMES WHEN I AM READY TO COMMIT SUICIDE
SHE SINGS THAT AIR AND INSTANTLY THE GLOOM AND MADNESS WHICH HUNG OVER
ME ARE DISPERSED AND I BREATHE FREELY AGAIN
JULY 18
WILHELM WHAT IS THE WORLD TO OUR HEARTS WITHOUT LOVE WHAT IS A
MAGIC LANTERN WITHOUT LIGHT YOU HAVE BUT TO KINDLE THE FLAME WITHIN
AND THE BRIGHTEST FIGURES SHINE ON THE WHITE WALL AND IF LOVE ONLY
SHOW US FLEETING SHADOWS WE ARE YET HAPPY WHEN LIKE MERE CHILDREN WE
BEHOLD THEM AND ARE TRANSPORTED WITH THE SPLENDID PHANTOMS
I HAVE NOT
BEEN ABLE TO SEE CHARLOTTE TO DAY
I WAS PREVENTED BY COMPANY FROM WHICH
I COULD NOT DISENGAGE MYSELF
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE I SENT MY SERVANT TO
HER HOUSE THAT I MIGHT AT LEAST SEE SOMEBODY TO DAY WHO HAD BEEN NEAR
HER
OH THE IMPATIENCE WITH WHICH I WAITED FOR HIS RETURN THE JOY WITH
WHICH I WELCOMED HIM I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE CAUGHT HIM IN MY ARMS AND
KISSED HIM IF I HAD NOT BEEN ASHAMED
IT IS SAID THAT THE BONONA STONE WHEN PLACED IN THE SUN ATTRACTS THE
RAYS AND FOR A TIME APPEARS LUMINOUS IN THE DARK
SO WAS IT WITH ME
AND THIS SERVANT
THE IDEA THAT CHARLOTTE'S EYES HAD DWELT ON HIS
COUNTENANCE HIS CHEEK HIS VERY APPAREL ENDEARED THEM ALL INESTIMABLY
TO ME SO THAT AT THE MOMENT I WOULD NOT HAVE PARTED FROM HIM FOR A
THOUSAND CROWNS
HIS PRESENCE MADE ME SO HAPPY BEWARE OF LAUGHING AT
ME WILHELM
CAN THAT BE A DELUSION WHICH MAKES US HAPPY
JULY 19
I SHALL SEE HER TODAY I EXCLAIM WITH DELIGHT WHEN I RISE IN THE
MORNING AND LOOK OUT WITH GLADNESS OF HEART AT THE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL
SUN
I SHALL SEE HER TODAY AND THEN I HAVE NO FURTHER WISH TO FORM
ALL ALL IS INCLUDED IN THAT ONE THOUGHT
JULY 20
I CANNOT ASSENT TO YOUR PROPOSAL THAT I SHOULD ACCOMPANY THE AMBASSADOR
TO
I DO NOT LOVE SUBORDINATION AND WE ALL KNOW THAT HE IS
A ROUGH DISAGREEABLE PERSON TO BE CONNECTED WITH
YOU SAY MY MOTHER
WISHES ME TO BE EMPLOYED
I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THAT
AM I NOT
SUFFICIENTLY EMPLOYED AND IS IT NOT IN REALITY THE SAME WHETHER
I SHELL PEAS OR COUNT LENTILS THE WORLD RUNS ON FROM ONE FOLLY TO
ANOTHER AND THE MAN WHO SOLELY FROM REGARD TO THE OPINION OF OTHERS
AND WITHOUT ANY WISH OR NECESSITY OF HIS OWN TOILS AFTER GOLD HONOUR
OR ANY OTHER PHANTOM IS NO BETTER THAN A FOOL
JULY 24
YOU INSIST SO MUCH ON MY NOT NEGLECTING MY DRAWING THAT IT WOULD BE AS
WELL FOR ME TO SAY NOTHING AS TO CONFESS HOW LITTLE I HAVE LATELY DONE
I NEVER FELT HAPPIER I NEVER UNDERSTOOD NATURE BETTER EVEN DOWN TO THE
VERIEST STEM OR SMALLEST BLADE OF GRASS AND YET I AM UNABLE TO EXPRESS
MYSELF MY POWERS OF EXECUTION ARE SO WEAK EVERYTHING SEEMS TO SWIM
AND FLOAT BEFORE ME SO THAT I CANNOT MAKE A CLEAR BOLD OUTLINE
BUT
I FANCY I SHOULD SUCCEED BETTER IF I HAD SOME CLAY OR WAX TO MODEL
I
SHALL TRY IF THIS STATE OF MIND CONTINUES MUCH LONGER AND WILL TAKE TO
MODELLING IF I ONLY KNEAD DOUGH
I HAVE COMMENCED CHARLOTTE'S PORTRAIT THREE TIMES AND HAVE AS OFTEN
DISGRACED MYSELF
THIS IS THE MORE ANNOYING AS I WAS FORMERLY VERY
HAPPY IN TAKING LIKENESSES
I HAVE SINCE SKETCHED HER PROFILE AND MUST
CONTENT MYSELF WITH THAT
JULY 25
YES DEAR CHARLOTTE I WILL ORDER AND ARRANGE EVERYTHING
ONLY GIVE
ME MORE COMMISSIONS THE MORE THE BETTER
ONE THING HOWEVER I MUST
REQUEST USE NO MORE WRITING SAND WITH THE DEAR NOTES YOU SEND ME
TODAY
I RAISED YOUR LETTER HASTILY TO MY LIPS AND IT SET MY TEETH ON EDGE
JULY 26
I HAVE OFTEN DETERMINED NOT TO SEE HER SO FREQUENTLY
BUT WHO COULD KEEP
SUCH A RESOLUTION EVERY DAY I AM EXPOSED TO THE TEMPTATION AND PROMISE
FAITHFULLY THAT TO MORROW I WILL REALLY STAY AWAY BUT WHEN TOMORROW
COMES I FIND SOME IRRESISTIBLE REASON FOR SEEING HER AND BEFORE I CAN
ACCOUNT FOR IT I AM WITH HER AGAIN
EITHER SHE HAS SAID ON THE PREVIOUS
EVENING YOU WILL BE SURE TO CALL TO MORROW AND WHO COULD STAY AWAY
THEN OR SHE GIVES ME SOME COMMISSION AND I FIND IT ESSENTIAL TO TAKE
HER THE ANSWER IN PERSON OR THE DAY IS FINE AND I WALK TO WALHEIM
AND WHEN I AM THERE IT IS ONLY HALF A LEAGUE FARTHER TO HER
I AM
WITHIN THE CHARMED ATMOSPHERE AND SOON FIND MYSELF AT HER SIDE
MY
GRANDMOTHER USED TO TELL US A STORY OF A MOUNTAIN OF LOADSTONE
WHEN ANY
VESSELS CAME NEAR IT THEY WERE INSTANTLY DEPRIVED OF THEIR IRONWORK
THE NAILS FLEW TO THE MOUNTAIN AND THE UNHAPPY CREW PERISHED AMIDST THE
DISJOINTED PLANKS
JULY 30
ALBERT IS ARRIVED AND I MUST TAKE MY DEPARTURE
WERE HE THE BEST AND
NOBLEST OF MEN AND I IN EVERY RESPECT HIS INFERIOR I COULD NOT ENDURE
TO SEE HIM IN POSSESSION OF SUCH A PERFECT BEING
POSSESSION ENOUGH
WILHELM HER BETROTHED IS HERE A FINE WORTHY FELLOW WHOM ONE CANNOT
HELP LIKING
FORTUNATELY I WAS NOT PRESENT AT THEIR MEETING
IT WOULD
HAVE BROKEN MY HEART AND HE IS SO CONSIDERATE HE HAS NOT GIVEN
CHARLOTTE ONE KISS IN MY PRESENCE
HEAVEN REWARD HIM FOR IT I MUST LOVE
HIM FOR THE RESPECT WITH WHICH HE TREATS HER
HE SHOWS A REGARD FOR ME
BUT FOR THIS I SUSPECT I AM MORE INDEBTED TO CHARLOTTE THAN TO HIS OWN
FANCY FOR ME
WOMEN HAVE A DELICATE TACT IN SUCH MATTERS AND IT SHOULD
BE SO
THEY CANNOT ALWAYS SUCCEED IN KEEPING TWO RIVALS ON TERMS WITH
EACH OTHER BUT WHEN THEY DO THEY ARE THE ONLY GAINERS
I CANNOT HELP ESTEEMING ALBERT
THE COOLNESS OF HIS TEMPER CONTRASTS
STRONGLY WITH THE IMPETUOSITY OF MINE WHICH I CANNOT CONCEAL
HE HAS
A GREAT DEAL OF FEELING AND IS FULLY SENSIBLE OF THE TREASURE HE
POSSESSES IN CHARLOTTE
HE IS FREE FROM ILL HUMOUR WHICH YOU KNOW IS
THE FAULT I DETEST MOST
HE REGARDS ME AS A MAN OF SENSE AND MY ATTACHMENT TO CHARLOTTE AND THE
INTEREST I TAKE IN ALL THAT CONCERNS HER AUGMENT HIS TRIUMPH AND HIS
LOVE
I SHALL NOT INQUIRE WHETHER HE MAY NOT AT TIMES TEASE HER WITH
SOME LITTLE JEALOUSIES AS I KNOW THAT WERE I IN HIS PLACE I SHOULD
NOT BE ENTIRELY FREE FROM SUCH SENSATIONS
BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY MY PLEASURE WITH CHARLOTTE IS OVER
CALL IT
FOLLY OR INFATUATION WHAT SIGNIFIES A NAME THE THING SPEAKS FOR
ITSELF
BEFORE ALBERT CAME I KNEW ALL THAT I KNOW NOW
I KNEW I COULD
MAKE NO PRETENSIONS TO HER NOR DID I OFFER ANY THAT IS AS FAR AS IT
WAS POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENCE OF SO MUCH LOVELINESS NOT TO PANT FOR
ITS ENJOYMENT
AND NOW BEHOLD ME LIKE A SILLY FELLOW STARING WITH
ASTONISHMENT WHEN ANOTHER COMES IN AND DEPRIVES ME OF MY LOVE
I BITE MY LIPS AND FEEL INFINITE SCORN FOR THOSE WHO TELL ME TO BE
RESIGNED BECAUSE THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT
LET ME ESCAPE FROM THE YOKE
OF SUCH SILLY SUBTERFUGES I RAMBLE THROUGH THE WOODS AND WHEN I RETURN
TO CHARLOTTE AND FIND ALBERT SITTING BY HER SIDE IN THE SUMMER HOUSE
IN THE GARDEN I AM UNABLE TO BEAR IT BEHAVE LIKE A FOOL AND COMMIT A
THOUSAND EXTRAVAGANCES
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE SAID CHARLOTTE TODAY LET
US HAVE NO MORE SCENES LIKE THOSE OF LAST NIGHT YOU TERRIFY ME WHEN YOU
ARE SO VIOLENT BETWEEN OURSELVES I AM ALWAYS AWAY NOW WHEN HE VISITS
HER AND I FEEL DELIGHTED WHEN I FIND HER ALONE
AUGUST 8
BELIEVE ME DEAR WILHELM I DID NOT ALLUDE TO YOU WHEN I SPOKE SO
SEVERELY OF THOSE WHO ADVISE RESIGNATION TO INEVITABLE FATE
I DID NOT
THINK IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO INDULGE SUCH A SENTIMENT
BUT IN FACT YOU
ARE RIGHT
I ONLY SUGGEST ONE OBJECTION
IN THIS WORLD ONE IS SELDOM
REDUCED TO MAKE A SELECTION BETWEEN TWO ALTERNATIVES
THERE ARE AS MANY
VARIETIES OF CONDUCT AND OPINION AS THERE ARE TURNS OF FEATURE BETWEEN
AN AQUILINE NOSE AND A FLAT ONE
YOU WILL THEREFORE PERMIT ME TO CONCEDE YOUR ENTIRE ARGUMENT AND YET
CONTRIVE MEANS TO ESCAPE YOUR DILEMMA
YOUR POSITION IS THIS I HEAR YOU SAY EITHER YOU HAVE HOPES OF
OBTAINING CHARLOTTE OR YOU HAVE NONE
WELL IN THE FIRST CASE PURSUE
YOUR COURSE AND PRESS ON TO THE FULFILMENT OF YOUR WISHES
IN THE
SECOND BE A MAN AND SHAKE OFF A MISERABLE PASSION WHICH WILL ENERVATE
AND DESTROY YOU MY DEAR FRIEND THIS IS WELL AND EASILY SAID
BUT WOULD YOU REQUIRE A WRETCHED BEING WHOSE LIFE IS SLOWLY WASTING
UNDER A LINGERING DISEASE TO DESPATCH HIMSELF AT ONCE BY THE STROKE OF
A DAGGER DOES NOT THE VERY DISORDER WHICH CONSUMES HIS STRENGTH DEPRIVE
HIM OF THE COURAGE TO EFFECT HIS DELIVERANCE
YOU MAY ANSWER ME IF YOU PLEASE WITH A SIMILAR ANALOGY WHO WOULD
NOT PREFER THE AMPUTATION OF AN ARM TO THE PERILING OF LIFE BY DOUBT AND
PROCRASTINATION BUT I KNOW NOT IF I AM RIGHT AND LET US LEAVE THESE
COMPARISONS
ENOUGH THERE ARE MOMENTS WILHELM WHEN I COULD RISE UP AND SHAKE IT
ALL OFF AND WHEN IF I ONLY KNEW WHERE TO GO I COULD FLY FROM THIS
PLACE
THE SAME EVENING
MY DIARY WHICH I HAVE FOR SOME TIME NEGLECTED CAME BEFORE ME TODAY
AND I AM AMAZED TO SEE HOW DELIBERATELY I HAVE ENTANGLED MYSELF STEP BY
STEP
TO HAVE SEEN MY POSITION SO CLEARLY AND YET TO HAVE ACTED SO LIKE
A CHILD EVEN STILL I BEHOLD THE RESULT PLAINLY AND YET HAVE NO THOUGHT
OF ACTING WITH GREATER PRUDENCE
AUGUST 10
IF I WERE NOT A FOOL I COULD SPEND THE HAPPIEST AND MOST DELIGHTFUL
LIFE HERE
SO MANY AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND OF A KIND TO ENSURE
A WORTHY MAN'S HAPPINESS ARE SELDOM UNITED
ALAS I FEEL IT TOO
SENSIBLY THE HEART ALONE MAKES OUR HAPPINESS TO BE ADMITTED INTO
THIS MOST CHARMING FAMILY TO BE LOVED BY THE FATHER AS A SON BY THE
CHILDREN AS A FATHER AND BY CHARLOTTE THEN THE NOBLE ALBERT WHO NEVER
DISTURBS MY HAPPINESS BY ANY APPEARANCE OF ILL HUMOUR RECEIVING ME WITH
THE HEARTIEST AFFECTION AND LOVING ME NEXT TO CHARLOTTE BETTER
THAN ALL THE WORLD WILHELM YOU WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR US IN OUR
RAMBLES AND CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CHARLOTTE
NOTHING IN THE WORLD CAN BE
MORE ABSURD THAN OUR CONNECTION AND YET THE THOUGHT OF IT OFTEN MOVES
ME TO TEARS
HE TELLS ME SOMETIMES OF HER EXCELLENT MOTHER HOW UPON HER DEATH BED
SHE HAD COMMITTED HER HOUSE AND CHILDREN TO CHARLOTTE AND HAD GIVEN
CHARLOTTE HERSELF IN CHARGE TO HIM HOW SINCE THAT TIME A NEW SPIRIT
HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER HOW IN CARE AND ANXIETY FOR THEIR WELFARE
SHE BECAME A REAL MOTHER TO THEM HOW EVERY MOMENT OF HER TIME WAS
DEVOTED TO SOME LABOUR OF LOVE IN THEIR BEHALF AND YET HER MIRTH AND
CHEERFULNESS HAD NEVER FORSAKEN HER
I WALK BY HIS SIDE PLUCK FLOWERS
BY THE WAY ARRANGE THEM CAREFULLY INTO A NOSEGAY THEN FLING THEM INTO
THE FIRST STREAM I PASS AND WATCH THEM AS THEY FLOAT GENTLY AWAY
I
FORGET WHETHER I TOLD YOU THAT ALBERT IS TO REMAIN HERE
HE HAS RECEIVED
A GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENT WITH A VERY GOOD SALARY AND I UNDERSTAND
HE IS IN HIGH FAVOUR AT COURT
I HAVE MET FEW PERSONS SO PUNCTUAL AND
METHODICAL IN BUSINESS
AUGUST 12
CERTAINLY ALBERT IS THE BEST FELLOW IN THE WORLD
I HAD A STRANGE SCENE
WITH HIM YESTERDAY
I WENT TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIM FOR I TOOK IT INTO MY
HEAD TO SPEND A FEW DAYS IN THESE MOUNTAINS FROM WHERE I NOW WRITE
TO YOU
AS I WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM MY EYE FELL UPON HIS
PISTOLS
LEND ME THOSE PISTOLS SAID I FOR MY JOURNEY BY ALL
MEANS HE REPLIED IF YOU WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO LOAD THEM FOR THEY
ONLY HANG THERE FOR FORM I TOOK DOWN ONE OF THEM AND HE CONTINUED
EVER SINCE I WAS NEAR SUFFERING FOR MY EXTREME CAUTION I WILL HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH SUCH THINGS I WAS CURIOUS TO HEAR THE STORY
I WAS
STAYING SAID HE SOME THREE MONTHS AGO AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE IN THE
COUNTRY
I HAD A BRACE OF PISTOLS WITH ME UNLOADED AND I SLEPT WITHOUT
ANY ANXIETY
ONE RAINY AFTERNOON I WAS SITTING BY MYSELF DOING NOTHING
WHEN IT OCCURRED TO ME I DO NOT KNOW HOW THAT THE HOUSE MIGHT BE
ATTACKED THAT WE MIGHT REQUIRE THE PISTOLS THAT WE MIGHT IN SHORT YOU
KNOW HOW WE GO ON FANCYING WHEN WE HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO
I GAVE
THE PISTOLS TO THE SERVANT TO CLEAN AND LOAD
HE WAS PLAYING WITH THE
MAID AND TRYING TO FRIGHTEN HER WHEN THE PISTOL WENT OFF GOD KNOWS
HOW THE RAMROD WAS IN THE BARREL AND IT WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH
HER RIGHT HAND AND SHATTERED THE THUMB
I HAD TO ENDURE ALL THE
LAMENTATION AND TO PAY THE SURGEON'S BILL SO SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE
KEPT ALL MY WEAPONS UNLOADED
BUT MY DEAR FRIEND WHAT IS THE USE OF
PRUDENCE WE CAN NEVER BE ON OUR GUARD AGAINST ALL POSSIBLE DANGERS
HOWEVER NOW YOU MUST KNOW I CAN TOLERATE ALL MEN TILL THEY COME TO
HOWEVER FOR IT IS SELF EVIDENT THAT EVERY UNIVERSAL RULE MUST HAVE
ITS EXCEPTIONS
BUT HE IS SO EXCEEDINGLY ACCURATE THAT IF HE ONLY
FANCIES HE HAS SAID A WORD TOO PRECIPITATE OR TOO GENERAL OR ONLY HALF
TRUE HE NEVER CEASES TO QUALIFY TO MODIFY AND EXTENUATE TILL AT LAST
HE APPEARS TO HAVE SAID NOTHING AT ALL
UPON THIS OCCASION ALBERT WAS
DEEPLY IMMERSED IN HIS SUBJECT I CEASED TO LISTEN TO HIM AND BECAME
LOST IN REVERIE
WITH A SUDDEN MOTION I POINTED THE MOUTH OF THE PISTOL
TO MY FOREHEAD OVER THE RIGHT EYE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED ALBERT
TURNING BACK THE PISTOL
IT IS NOT LOADED SAID I
AND EVEN IF NOT
HE ANSWERED WITH IMPATIENCE WHAT CAN YOU MEAN I CANNOT COMPREHEND HOW
A MAN CAN BE SO MAD AS TO SHOOT HIMSELF AND THE BARE IDEA OF IT SHOCKS
ME
BUT WHY SHOULD ANY ONE SAID I IN SPEAKING OF AN ACTION VENTURE
TO PRONOUNCE IT MAD OR WISE OR GOOD OR BAD WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL
THIS HAVE YOU CAREFULLY STUDIED THE SECRET MOTIVES OF OUR ACTIONS DO
YOU UNDERSTAND CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE CAUSES WHICH OCCASION THEM AND MAKE
THEM INEVITABLE IF YOU CAN YOU WILL BE LESS HASTY WITH YOUR DECISION
BUT YOU WILL ALLOW SAID ALBERT THAT SOME ACTIONS ARE CRIMINAL LET
THEM SPRING FROM WHATEVER MOTIVES THEY MAY I GRANTED IT AND SHRUGGED
MY SHOULDERS
BUT STILL MY GOOD FRIEND I CONTINUED THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS
HERE TOO
THEFT IS A CRIME BUT THE MAN WHO COMMITS IT FROM EXTREME
POVERTY WITH NO DESIGN BUT TO SAVE HIS FAMILY FROM PERISHING IS HE AN
OBJECT OF PITY OR OF PUNISHMENT WHO SHALL THROW THE FIRST STONE AT A
HUSBAND WHO IN THE HEAT OF JUST RESENTMENT SACRIFICES HIS FAITHLESS
WIFE AND HER PERFIDIOUS SEDUCER OR AT THE YOUNG MAIDEN WHO IN HER
WEAK HOUR OF RAPTURE FORGETS HERSELF IN THE IMPETUOUS JOYS OF LOVE
EVEN OUR LAWS COLD AND CRUEL AS THEY ARE RELENT IN SUCH CASES AND
WITHHOLD THEIR PUNISHMENT
THAT IS QUITE ANOTHER THING SAID ALBERT BECAUSE A MAN UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF VIOLENT PASSION LOSES ALL POWER OF REFLECTION AND IS
REGARDED AS INTOXICATED OR INSANE
OH YOU PEOPLE OF SOUND UNDERSTANDINGS I REPLIED SMILING ARE EVER
READY TO EXCLAIM 'EXTRAVAGANCE AND MADNESS AND INTOXICATION YOU
MORAL MEN ARE SO CALM AND SO SUBDUED YOU ABHOR THE DRUNKEN MAN AND
DETEST THE EXTRAVAGANT YOU PASS BY LIKE THE LEVITE AND THANK GOD
LIKE THE PHARISEE THAT YOU ARE NOT LIKE ONE OF THEM
I HAVE BEEN MORE
THAN ONCE INTOXICATED MY PASSIONS HAVE ALWAYS BORDERED ON EXTRAVAGANCE
I AM NOT ASHAMED TO CONFESS IT FOR I HAVE LEARNED BY MY OWN
EXPERIENCE THAT ALL EXTRAORDINARY MEN WHO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED GREAT AND
ASTONISHING ACTIONS HAVE EVER BEEN DECRIED BY THE WORLD AS DRUNKEN OR
INSANE
AND IN PRIVATE LIFE TOO IS IT NOT INTOLERABLE THAT NO ONE CAN
UNDERTAKE THE EXECUTION OF A NOBLE OR GENEROUS DEED WITHOUT GIVING RISE
TO THE EXCLAMATION THAT THE DOER IS INTOXICATED OR MAD SHAME UPON YOU
YE SAGES
THIS IS ANOTHER OF YOUR EXTRAVAGANT HUMOURS SAID ALBERT YOU ALWAYS
EXAGGERATE A CASE AND IN THIS MATTER YOU ARE UNDOUBTEDLY WRONG FOR WE
WERE SPEAKING OF SUICIDE WHICH YOU COMPARE WITH GREAT ACTIONS WHEN IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REGARD IT AS ANYTHING BUT A WEAKNESS
IT IS MUCH EASIER
TO DIE THAN TO BEAR A LIFE OF MISERY WITH FORTITUDE
I WAS ON THE POINT OF BREAKING OFF THE CONVERSATION FOR NOTHING PUTS ME
SO COMPLETELY OUT OF PATIENCE AS THE UTTERANCE OF A WRETCHED COMMONPLACE
WHEN I AM TALKING FROM MY INMOST HEART
HOWEVER I COMPOSED MYSELF FOR
I HAD OFTEN HEARD THE SAME OBSERVATION WITH SUFFICIENT VEXATION AND
I ANSWERED HIM THEREFORE WITH A LITTLE WARMTH YOU CALL THIS A
WEAKNESS BEWARE OF BEING LED ASTRAY BY APPEARANCES
WHEN A NATION
WHICH HAS LONG GROANED UNDER THE INTOLERABLE YOKE OF A TYRANT RISES AT
LAST AND THROWS OFF ITS CHAINS DO YOU CALL THAT WEAKNESS THE MAN
WHO TO RESCUE HIS HOUSE FROM THE FLAMES FINDS HIS PHYSICAL STRENGTH
REDOUBLED SO THAT HE LIFTS BURDENS WITH EASE WHICH IN THE ABSENCE OF
EXCITEMENT HE COULD SCARCELY MOVE HE WHO UNDER THE RAGE OF AN INSULT
ATTACKS AND PUTS TO FLIGHT HALF A SCORE OF HIS ENEMIES ARE SUCH PERSONS
TO BE CALLED WEAK MY GOOD FRIEND IF RESISTANCE BE STRENGTH HOW CAN
THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF RESISTANCE BE A WEAKNESS
ALBERT LOOKED STEADFASTLY AT ME AND SAID PRAY FORGIVE ME BUT I DO
NOT SEE THAT THE EXAMPLES YOU HAVE ADDUCED BEAR ANY RELATION TO THE
QUESTION VERY LIKELY I ANSWERED FOR I HAVE OFTEN BEEN TOLD THAT
MY STYLE OF ILLUSTRATION BORDERS A LITTLE ON THE ABSURD
BUT LET US SEE
IF WE CANNOT PLACE THE MATTER IN ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW BY INQUIRING
WHAT CAN BE A MAN'S STATE OF MIND WHO RESOLVES TO FREE HIMSELF FROM
THE BURDEN OF LIFE A BURDEN OFTEN SO PLEASANT TO BEAR FOR WE CANNOT
OTHERWISE REASON FAIRLY UPON THE SUBJECT
HUMAN NATURE I CONTINUED HAS ITS LIMITS
IT IS ABLE TO ENDURE A
CERTAIN DEGREE OF JOY SORROW AND PAIN BUT BECOMES ANNIHILATED AS SOON
AS THIS MEASURE IS EXCEEDED
THE QUESTION THEREFORE IS NOT WHETHER A
MAN IS STRONG OR WEAK BUT WHETHER HE IS ABLE TO ENDURE THE MEASURE
OF HIS SUFFERINGS
THE SUFFERING MAY BE MORAL OR PHYSICAL AND IN
MY OPINION IT IS JUST AS ABSURD TO CALL A MAN A COWARD WHO DESTROYS
HIMSELF AS TO CALL A MAN A COWARD WHO DIES OF A MALIGNANT FEVER
PARADOX ALL PARADOX EXCLAIMED ALBERT
NOT SO PARADOXICAL AS YOU
IMAGINE I REPLIED
YOU ALLOW THAT WE DESIGNATE A DISEASE AS MORTAL
WHEN NATURE IS SO SEVERELY ATTACKED AND HER STRENGTH SO FAR EXHAUSTED
THAT SHE CANNOT POSSIBLY RECOVER HER FORMER CONDITION UNDER ANY CHANGE
THAT MAY TAKE PLACE
NOW MY GOOD FRIEND APPLY THIS TO THE MIND OBSERVE A MAN IN
HIS NATURAL ISOLATED CONDITION CONSIDER HOW IDEAS WORK AND HOW
IMPRESSIONS FASTEN ON HIM TILL AT LENGTH A VIOLENT PASSION SEIZES HIM
DESTROYING ALL HIS POWERS OF CALM REFLECTION AND UTTERLY RUINING HIM
IT IS IN VAIN THAT A MAN OF SOUND MIND AND COOL TEMPER UNDERSTANDS THE
CONDITION OF SUCH A WRETCHED BEING IN VAIN HE COUNSELS HIM
HE CAN NO
MORE COMMUNICATE HIS OWN WISDOM TO HIM THAN A HEALTHY MAN CAN INSTIL HIS
STRENGTH INTO THE INVALID BY WHOSE BEDSIDE HE IS SEATED
ALBERT THOUGHT THIS TOO GENERAL
I REMINDED HIM OF A GIRL WHO HAD
DROWNED HERSELF A SHORT TIME PREVIOUSLY AND I RELATED HER HISTORY
SHE WAS A GOOD CREATURE WHO HAD GROWN UP IN THE NARROW SPHERE OF
HOUSEHOLD INDUSTRY AND WEEKLY APPOINTED LABOUR ONE WHO KNEW NO PLEASURE
BEYOND INDULGING IN A WALK ON SUNDAYS ARRAYED IN HER BEST ATTIRE
ACCOMPANIED BY HER FRIENDS OR PERHAPS JOINING IN THE DANCE NOW AND THEN
AT SOME FESTIVAL AND CHATTING AWAY HER SPARE HOURS WITH A NEIGHBOUR
DISCUSSING THE SCANDAL OR THE QUARRELS OF THE VILLAGE TRIFLES
SUFFICIENT TO OCCUPY HER HEART
AT LENGTH THE WARMTH OF HER NATURE IS
INFLUENCED BY CERTAIN NEW AND UNKNOWN WISHES
INFLAMED BY THE FLATTERIES
OF MEN HER FORMER PLEASURES BECOME BY DEGREES INSIPID TILL AT LENGTH
SHE MEETS WITH A YOUTH TO WHOM SHE IS ATTRACTED BY AN INDESCRIBABLE
FEELING UPON HIM SHE NOW RESTS ALL HER HOPES SHE FORGETS THE WORLD
AROUND HER SHE SEES HEARS DESIRES NOTHING BUT HIM AND HIM ONLY
HE
ALONE OCCUPIES ALL HER THOUGHTS
UNCORRUPTED BY THE IDLE INDULGENCE OF
AN ENERVATING VANITY HER AFFECTION MOVING STEADILY TOWARD ITS OBJECT
SHE HOPES TO BECOME HIS AND TO REALISE IN AN EVERLASTING UNION WITH
HIM ALL THAT HAPPINESS WHICH SHE SOUGHT ALL THAT BLISS FOR WHICH
SHE LONGED
HIS REPEATED PROMISES CONFIRM HER HOPES EMBRACES AND
ENDEARMENTS WHICH INCREASE THE ARDOUR OF HER DESIRES OVERMASTER HER
SOUL
SHE FLOATS IN A DIM DELUSIVE ANTICIPATION OF HER HAPPINESS AND
HER FEELINGS BECOME EXCITED TO THEIR UTMOST TENSION
SHE STRETCHES OUT
HER ARMS FINALLY TO EMBRACE THE OBJECT OF ALL HER WISHES AND HER LOVER
FORSAKES HER
STUNNED AND BEWILDERED SHE STANDS UPON A PRECIPICE
ALL
IS DARKNESS AROUND HER
NO PROSPECT NO HOPE NO CONSOLATION FORSAKEN
BY HIM IN WHOM HER EXISTENCE WAS CENTRED SHE SEES NOTHING OF THE WIDE
WORLD BEFORE HER THINKS NOTHING OF THE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT
SUPPLY THE VOID IN HER HEART SHE FEELS HERSELF DESERTED FORSAKEN BY
THE WORLD AND BLINDED AND IMPELLED BY THE AGONY WHICH WRINGS HER SOUL
SHE PLUNGES INTO THE DEEP TO END HER SUFFERINGS IN THE BROAD EMBRACE OF
DEATH
SEE HERE ALBERT THE HISTORY OF THOUSANDS AND TELL ME IS NOT
THIS A CASE OF PHYSICAL INFIRMITY NATURE HAS NO WAY TO ESCAPE FROM THE
LABYRINTH HER POWERS ARE EXHAUSTED SHE CAN CONTEND NO LONGER AND THE
POOR SOUL MUST DIE
SHAME UPON HIM WHO CAN LOOK ON CALMLY AND EXCLAIM 'THE FOOLISH GIRL
SHE SHOULD HAVE WAITED SHE SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED TIME TO WEAR OFF THE
IMPRESSION HER DESPAIR WOULD HAVE BEEN SOFTENED AND SHE WOULD HAVE
FOUND ANOTHER LOVER TO COMFORT HER ONE MIGHT AS WELL SAY 'THE FOOL
TO DIE OF A FEVER WHY DID HE NOT WAIT TILL HIS STRENGTH WAS RESTORED
TILL HIS BLOOD BECAME CALM ALL WOULD THEN HAVE GONE WELL AND HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN ALIVE NOW
ALBERT WHO COULD NOT SEE THE JUSTICE OF THE COMPARISON OFFERED SOME
FURTHER OBJECTIONS AND AMONGST OTHERS URGED THAT I HAD TAKEN THE
CASE OF A MERE IGNORANT GIRL
BUT HOW ANY MAN OF SENSE OF MORE ENLARGED
VIEWS AND EXPERIENCE COULD BE EXCUSED HE WAS UNABLE TO COMPREHEND
MY
FRIEND I EXCLAIMED MAN IS BUT MAN AND WHATEVER BE THE EXTENT
OF HIS REASONING POWERS THEY ARE OF LITTLE AVAIL WHEN PASSION RAGES
WITHIN AND HE FEELS HIMSELF CONFINED BY THE NARROW LIMITS OF NATURE
IT WERE BETTER THEN BUT WE WILL TALK OF THIS SOME OTHER TIME I SAID
AND CAUGHT UP MY HAT
ALAS MY HEART WAS FULL AND WE PARTED WITHOUT
CONVICTION ON EITHER SIDE
HOW RARELY IN THIS WORLD DO MEN UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER
AUGUST 15
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IN THIS WORLD NOTHING IS SO INDISPENSABLE AS
LOVE
I OBSERVE THAT CHARLOTTE COULD NOT LOSE ME WITHOUT A PANG AND THE
VERY CHILDREN HAVE BUT ONE WISH THAT IS THAT I SHOULD VISIT THEM AGAIN
TO MORROW
I WENT THIS AFTERNOON TO TUNE CHARLOTTE'S PIANO
BUT I COULD
NOT DO IT FOR THE LITTLE ONES INSISTED ON MY TELLING THEM A STORY AND
CHARLOTTE HERSELF URGED ME TO SATISFY THEM
I WAITED UPON THEM AT TEA
AND THEY ARE NOW AS FULLY CONTENTED WITH ME AS WITH CHARLOTTE AND
I TOLD THEM MY VERY BEST TALE OF THE PRINCESS WHO WAS WAITED UPON BY
DWARFS
I IMPROVE MYSELF BY THIS EXERCISE AND AM QUITE SURPRISED AT THE
IMPRESSION MY STORIES CREATE
IF I SOMETIMES INVENT AN INCIDENT WHICH I
FORGET UPON THE NEXT NARRATION THEY REMIND ONE DIRECTLY THAT THE STORY
WAS DIFFERENT BEFORE SO THAT I NOW ENDEAVOUR TO RELATE WITH EXACTNESS
THE SAME ANECDOTE IN THE SAME MONOTONOUS TONE WHICH NEVER CHANGES
I
FIND BY THIS HOW MUCH AN AUTHOR INJURES HIS WORKS BY ALTERING THEM
EVEN THOUGH THEY BE IMPROVED IN A POETICAL POINT OF VIEW
THE FIRST
IMPRESSION IS READILY RECEIVED
WE ARE SO CONSTITUTED THAT WE BELIEVE
THE MOST INCREDIBLE THINGS AND ONCE THEY ARE ENGRAVED UPON THE MEMORY
WOE TO HIM WHO WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO EFFACE THEM
AUGUST 18
MUST IT EVER BE THUS THAT THE SOURCE OF OUR HAPPINESS MUST ALSO BE THE
FOUNTAIN OF OUR MISERY THE FULL AND ARDENT SENTIMENT WHICH ANIMATED
MY HEART WITH THE LOVE OF NATURE OVERWHELMING ME WITH A TORRENT OF
DELIGHT AND WHICH BROUGHT ALL PARADISE BEFORE ME HAS NOW BECOME AN
INSUPPORTABLE TORMENT A DEMON WHICH PERPETUALLY PURSUES AND HARASSES
ME
WHEN IN BYGONE DAYS I GAZED FROM THESE ROCKS UPON YONDER MOUNTAINS
ACROSS THE RIVER AND UPON THE GREEN FLOWERY VALLEY BEFORE ME AND SAW
ALL NATURE BUDDING AND BURSTING AROUND THE HILLS CLOTHED FROM FOOT
TO PEAK WITH TALL THICK FOREST TREES THE VALLEYS IN ALL THEIR VARIED
WINDINGS SHADED WITH THE LOVELIEST WOODS AND THE SOFT RIVER GLIDING
ALONG AMONGST THE LISPING REEDS MIRRORING THE BEAUTIFUL CLOUDS WHICH
THE SOFT EVENING BREEZE WAFTED ACROSS THE SKY WHEN I HEARD THE GROVES
ABOUT ME MELODIOUS WITH THE MUSIC OF BIRDS AND SAW THE MILLION SWARMS
OF INSECTS DANCING IN THE LAST GOLDEN BEAMS OF THE SUN WHOSE SETTING
RAYS AWOKE THE HUMMING BEETLES FROM THEIR GRASSY BEDS WHILST THE
SUBDUED TUMULT AROUND DIRECTED MY ATTENTION TO THE GROUND AND I THERE
OBSERVED THE ARID ROCK COMPELLED TO YIELD NUTRIMENT TO THE DRY MOSS
WHILST THE HEATH FLOURISHED UPON THE BARREN SANDS BELOW ME ALL THIS
DISPLAYED TO ME THE INNER WARMTH WHICH ANIMATES ALL NATURE AND FILLED
AND GLOWED WITHIN MY HEART
I FELT MYSELF EXALTED BY THIS OVERFLOWING
FULNESS TO THE PERCEPTION OF THE GODHEAD AND THE GLORIOUS FORMS OF
AN INFINITE UNIVERSE BECAME VISIBLE TO MY SOUL STUPENDOUS MOUNTAINS
ENCOMPASSED ME ABYSSES YAWNED AT MY FEET AND CATARACTS FELL HEADLONG
DOWN BEFORE ME IMPETUOUS RIVERS ROLLED THROUGH THE PLAIN AND ROCKS
AND MOUNTAINS RESOUNDED FROM AFAR
IN THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH I SAW
INNUMERABLE POWERS IN MOTION AND MULTIPLYING TO INFINITY WHILST
UPON ITS SURFACE AND BENEATH THE HEAVENS THERE TEEMED TEN THOUSAND
VARIETIES OF LIVING CREATURES
EVERYTHING AROUND IS ALIVE WITH AN
INFINITE NUMBER OF FORMS WHILE MANKIND FLY FOR SECURITY TO THEIR PETTY
HOUSES FROM THE SHELTER OF WHICH THEY RULE IN THEIR IMAGINATIONS OVER
THE WIDE EXTENDED UNIVERSE
POOR FOOL IN WHOSE PETTY ESTIMATION ALL
THINGS ARE LITTLE
FROM THE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS ACROSS THE DESERT
WHICH NO MORTAL FOOT HAS TROD FAR AS THE CONFINES OF THE UNKNOWN OCEAN
BREATHES THE SPIRIT OF THE ETERNAL CREATOR AND EVERY ATOM TO WHICH HE
HAS GIVEN EXISTENCE FINDS FAVOUR IN HIS SIGHT
AH HOW OFTEN AT THAT
TIME HAS THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD SOARING ABOVE MY HEAD INSPIRED ME
WITH THE DESIRE OF BEING TRANSPORTED TO THE SHORES OF THE IMMEASURABLE
WATERS THERE TO QUAFF THE PLEASURES OF LIFE FROM THE FOAMING GOBLET
OF THE INFINITE AND TO PARTAKE IF BUT FOR A MOMENT EVEN WITH
THE CONFINED POWERS OF MY SOUL THE BEATITUDE OF THAT CREATOR WHO
ACCOMPLISHES ALL THINGS IN HIMSELF AND THROUGH HIMSELF
MY DEAR FRIEND THE BARE RECOLLECTION OF THOSE HOURS STILL CONSOLES ME
EVEN THIS EFFORT TO RECALL THOSE INEFFABLE SENSATIONS AND GIVE THEM
UTTERANCE EXALTS MY SOUL ABOVE ITSELF AND MAKES ME DOUBLY FEEL THE
INTENSITY OF MY PRESENT ANGUISH
IT IS AS IF A CURTAIN HAD BEEN DRAWN FROM BEFORE MY EYES AND INSTEAD
OF PROSPECTS OF ETERNAL LIFE THE ABYSS OF AN EVER OPEN GRAVE YAWNED
BEFORE ME
CAN WE SAY OF ANYTHING THAT IT EXISTS WHEN ALL PASSES AWAY
WHEN TIME WITH THE SPEED OF A STORM CARRIES ALL THINGS ONWARD AND
OUR TRANSITORY EXISTENCE HURRIED ALONG BY THE TORRENT IS EITHER
SWALLOWED UP BY THE WAVES OR DASHED AGAINST THE ROCKS THERE IS NOT A
MOMENT BUT PREYS UPON YOU AND UPON ALL AROUND YOU NOT A MOMENT IN
WHICH YOU DO NOT YOURSELF BECOME A DESTROYER
THE MOST INNOCENT WALK
DEPRIVES OF LIFE THOUSANDS OF POOR INSECTS ONE STEP DESTROYS THE FABRIC
OF THE INDUSTRIOUS ANT AND CONVERTS A LITTLE WORLD INTO CHAOS
NO
IT IS NOT THE GREAT AND RARE CALAMITIES OF THE WORLD THE FLOODS WHICH
SWEEP AWAY WHOLE VILLAGES THE EARTHQUAKES WHICH SWALLOW UP OUR TOWNS
THAT AFFECT ME
MY HEART IS WASTED BY THE THOUGHT OF THAT DESTRUCTIVE
POWER WHICH LIES CONCEALED IN EVERY PART OF UNIVERSAL NATURE
NATURE HAS
FORMED NOTHING THAT DOES NOT CONSUME ITSELF AND EVERY OBJECT NEAR
IT SO THAT SURROUNDED BY EARTH AND AIR AND ALL THE ACTIVE POWERS I
WANDER ON MY WAY WITH ACHING HEART AND THE UNIVERSE IS TO ME A FEARFUL
MONSTER FOR EVER DEVOURING ITS OWN OFFSPRING
AUGUST 21
IN VAIN DO I STRETCH OUT MY ARMS TOWARD HER WHEN I AWAKEN IN THE MORNING
FROM MY WEARY SLUMBERS
IN VAIN DO I SEEK FOR HER AT NIGHT IN MY BED
WHEN SOME INNOCENT DREAM HAS HAPPILY DECEIVED ME AND PLACED HER NEAR ME
IN THE FIELDS WHEN I HAVE SEIZED HER HAND AND COVERED IT WITH COUNTLESS
KISSES
AND WHEN I FEEL FOR HER IN THE HALF CONFUSION OF SLEEP WITH THE
HAPPY SENSE THAT SHE IS NEAR TEARS FLOW FROM MY OPPRESSED HEART AND
BEREFT OF ALL COMFORT I WEEP OVER MY FUTURE WOES
AUGUST 22
WHAT A MISFORTUNE WILHELM MY ACTIVE SPIRITS HAVE DEGENERATED INTO
CONTENTED INDOLENCE
I CANNOT BE IDLE AND YET I AM UNABLE TO SET TO
WORK
I CANNOT THINK I HAVE NO LONGER ANY FEELING FOR THE BEAUTIES OF
NATURE AND BOOKS ARE DISTASTEFUL TO ME
ONCE WE GIVE OURSELVES UP WE
ARE TOTALLY LOST
MANY A TIME AND OFT I WISH I WERE A COMMON LABOURER
THAT AWAKENING IN THE MORNING I MIGHT HAVE BUT ONE PROSPECT ONE
PURSUIT ONE HOPE FOR THE DAY WHICH HAS DAWNED
I OFTEN ENVY ALBERT
WHEN I SEE HIM BURIED IN A HEAP OF PAPERS AND PARCHMENTS AND I FANCY I
SHOULD BE HAPPY WERE I IN HIS PLACE
OFTEN IMPRESSED WITH THIS FEELING
I HAVE BEEN ON THE POINT OF WRITING TO YOU AND TO THE MINISTER FOR THE
APPOINTMENT AT THE EMBASSY WHICH YOU THINK I MIGHT OBTAIN
I BELIEVE I
MIGHT PROCURE IT
THE MINISTER HAS LONG SHOWN A REGARD FOR ME AND HAS
FREQUENTLY URGED ME TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT
IT IS THE BUSINESS OF AN
HOUR ONLY
NOW AND THEN THE FABLE OF THE HORSE RECURS TO ME
WEARY OF
LIBERTY HE SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE SADDLED AND BRIDLED AND WAS RIDDEN
TO DEATH FOR HIS PAINS
I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DETERMINE UPON
FOR IS NOT
THIS ANXIETY FOR CHANGE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT RESTLESS SPIRIT WHICH
WOULD PURSUE ME EQUALLY IN EVERY SITUATION OF LIFE
AUGUST 28
IF MY ILLS WOULD ADMIT OF ANY CURE THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE CURED HERE
THIS IS MY BIRTHDAY AND EARLY IN THE MORNING I RECEIVED A PACKET FROM
ALBERT
UPON OPENING IT I FOUND ONE OF THE PINK RIBBONS WHICH CHARLOTTE
WORE IN HER DRESS THE FIRST TIME I SAW HER AND WHICH I HAD SEVERAL
TIMES ASKED HER TO GIVE ME
WITH IT WERE TWO VOLUMES IN DUODECIMO
OF WETSTEIN'S HOMER A BOOK I HAD OFTEN WISHED FOR TO SAVE ME THE
INCONVENIENCE OF CARRYING THE LARGE ERNESTINE EDITION WITH ME UPON MY
WALKS
YOU SEE HOW THEY ANTICIPATE MY WISHES HOW WELL THEY UNDERSTAND
ALL THOSE LITTLE ATTENTIONS OF FRIENDSHIP SO SUPERIOR TO THE COSTLY
PRESENTS OF THE GREAT WHICH ARE HUMILIATING
I KISSED THE RIBBON A
THOUSAND TIMES AND IN EVERY BREATH INHALED THE REMEMBRANCE OF THOSE
HAPPY AND IRREVOCABLE DAYS WHICH FILLED ME WITH THE KEENEST JOY
SUCH
WILHELM IS OUR FATE
I DO NOT MURMUR AT IT THE FLOWERS OF LIFE ARE BUT
VISIONARY
HOW MANY PASS AWAY AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND HOW FEW YIELD
ANY FRUIT AND THE FRUIT ITSELF HOW RARELY DOES IT RIPEN AND YET THERE
ARE FLOWERS ENOUGH AND IS IT NOT STRANGE MY FRIEND THAT WE SHOULD
SUFFER THE LITTLE THAT DOES REALLY RIPEN TO ROT DECAY AND PERISH
UNENJOYED FAREWELL THIS IS A GLORIOUS SUMMER
I OFTEN CLIMB INTO THE
TREES IN CHARLOTTE'S ORCHARD AND SHAKE DOWN THE PEARS THAT HANG ON THE
HIGHEST BRANCHES
SHE STANDS BELOW AND CATCHES THEM AS THEY FALL
AUGUST 30
UNHAPPY BEING THAT I AM WHY DO I THUS DECEIVE MYSELF WHAT IS TO COME
OF ALL THIS WILD AIMLESS ENDLESS PASSION I CANNOT PRAY EXCEPT TO HER
MY IMAGINATION SEES NOTHING BUT HER ALL SURROUNDING OBJECTS ARE OF NO
ACCOUNT EXCEPT AS THEY RELATE TO HER
IN THIS DREAMY STATE I ENJOY MANY
HAPPY HOURS TILL AT LENGTH I FEEL COMPELLED TO TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM
HER
AH WILHELM TO WHAT DOES NOT MY HEART OFTEN COMPEL ME WHEN I HAVE
SPENT SEVERAL HOURS IN HER COMPANY TILL I FEEL COMPLETELY ABSORBED BY
HER FIGURE HER GRACE THE DIVINE EXPRESSION OF HER THOUGHTS MY MIND
BECOMES GRADUALLY EXCITED TO THE HIGHEST EXCESS MY SIGHT GROWS DIM
MY HEARING CONFUSED MY BREATHING OPPRESSED AS IF BY THE HAND OF A
MURDERER AND MY BEATING HEART SEEKS TO OBTAIN RELIEF FOR MY ACHING
SENSES
I AM SOMETIMES UNCONSCIOUS WHETHER I REALLY EXIST
IF IN SUCH
MOMENTS I FIND NO SYMPATHY AND CHARLOTTE DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO ENJOY
THE MELANCHOLY CONSOLATION OF BATHING HER HAND WITH MY TEARS I FEEL
COMPELLED TO TEAR MYSELF FROM HER WHEN I EITHER WANDER THROUGH THE
COUNTRY CLIMB SOME PRECIPITOUS CLIFF OR FORCE A PATH THROUGH THE
TRACKLESS THICKET WHERE I AM LACERATED AND TORN BY THORNS AND BRIERS
AND THENCE I FIND RELIEF
SOMETIMES I LIE STRETCHED ON THE GROUND
OVERCOME WITH FATIGUE AND DYING WITH THIRST SOMETIMES LATE IN THE
NIGHT WHEN THE MOON SHINES ABOVE ME I RECLINE AGAINST AN AGED TREE
IN SOME SEQUESTERED FOREST TO REST MY WEARY LIMBS WHEN EXHAUSTED
AND WORN I SLEEP TILL BREAK OF DAY
O WILHELM THE HERMIT'S CELL HIS
SACKCLOTH AND GIRDLE OF THORNS WOULD BE LUXURY AND INDULGENCE COMPARED
WITH WHAT I SUFFER
ADIEU I SEE NO END TO THIS WRETCHEDNESS EXCEPT THE
GRAVE
SEPTEMBER 3
I MUST AWAY
THANK YOU WILHELM FOR DETERMINING MY WAVERING PURPOSE
FOR A WHOLE FORTNIGHT I HAVE THOUGHT OF LEAVING HER
I MUST AWAY
SHE HAS RETURNED TO TOWN AND IS AT THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND
AND THEN
ALBERT YES I MUST GO
SEPTEMBER 10
OH WHAT A NIGHT WILHELM I CAN HENCEFORTH BEAR ANYTHING
I SHALL NEVER
SEE HER AGAIN
OH WHY CANNOT I FALL ON YOUR NECK AND WITH FLOODS OF
TEARS AND RAPTURES GIVE UTTERANCE TO ALL THE PASSIONS WHICH DISTRACT MY
HEART HERE I SIT GASPING FOR BREATH AND STRUGGLING TO COMPOSE MYSELF
I WAIT FOR DAY AND AT SUNRISE THE HORSES ARE TO BE AT THE DOOR
AND SHE IS SLEEPING CALMLY LITTLE SUSPECTING THAT SHE HAS SEEN ME FOR
THE LAST TIME
I AM FREE
I HAVE HAD THE COURAGE IN AN INTERVIEW OF
TWO HOURS' DURATION NOT TO BETRAY MY INTENTION
AND O WILHELM WHAT A
CONVERSATION IT WAS
ALBERT HAD PROMISED TO COME TO CHARLOTTE IN THE GARDEN IMMEDIATELY
AFTER SUPPER
I WAS UPON THE TERRACE UNDER THE TALL CHESTNUT TREES AND
WATCHED THE SETTING SUN
I SAW HIM SINK FOR THE LAST TIME BENEATH THIS
DELIGHTFUL VALLEY AND SILENT STREAM
I HAD OFTEN VISITED THE SAME
SPOT WITH CHARLOTTE AND WITNESSED THAT GLORIOUS SIGHT AND NOW I WAS
WALKING UP AND DOWN THE VERY AVENUE WHICH WAS SO DEAR TO ME
A SECRET
SYMPATHY HAD FREQUENTLY DRAWN ME THITHER BEFORE I KNEW CHARLOTTE AND
WE WERE DELIGHTED WHEN IN OUR EARLY ACQUAINTANCE WE DISCOVERED THAT WE
EACH LOVED THE SAME SPOT WHICH IS INDEED AS ROMANTIC AS ANY THAT EVER
CAPTIVATED THE FANCY OF AN ARTIST
FROM BENEATH THE CHESTNUT TREES THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE VIEW
BUT I
REMEMBER THAT I HAVE MENTIONED ALL THIS IN A FORMER LETTER AND HAVE
DESCRIBED THE TALL MASS OF BEECH TREES AT THE END AND HOW THE AVENUE
GROWS DARKER AND DARKER AS IT WINDS ITS WAY AMONG THEM TILL IT ENDS
IN A GLOOMY RECESS WHICH HAS ALL THE CHARM OF A MYSTERIOUS SOLITUDE
I
STILL REMEMBER THE STRANGE FEELING OF MELANCHOLY WHICH CAME OVER ME THE
FIRST TIME I ENTERED THAT DARK RETREAT AT BRIGHT MIDDAY
I FELT SOME
SECRET FOREBODING THAT IT WOULD ONE DAY BE TO ME THE SCENE OF SOME
HAPPINESS OR MISERY
I HAD SPENT HALF AN HOUR STRUGGLING BETWEEN THE CONTENDING THOUGHTS OF
GOING AND RETURNING WHEN I HEARD THEM COMING UP THE TERRACE
I RAN TO
MEET THEM
I TREMBLED AS I TOOK HER HAND AND KISSED IT
AS WE REACHED
THE TOP OF THE TERRACE THE MOON ROSE FROM BEHIND THE WOODED HILL
WE
CONVERSED ON MANY SUBJECTS AND WITHOUT PERCEIVING IT APPROACHED THE
GLOOMY RECESS
CHARLOTTE ENTERED AND SAT DOWN
ALBERT SEATED HIMSELF
BESIDE HER
I DID THE SAME BUT MY AGITATION DID NOT SUFFER ME TO REMAIN
LONG SEATED
I GOT UP AND STOOD BEFORE HER THEN WALKED BACKWARD AND
FORWARD AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
I WAS RESTLESS AND MISERABLE
CHARLOTTE
DREW OUR ATTENTION TO THE BEAUTIFUL EFFECT OF THE MOONLIGHT WHICH THREW
A SILVER HUE OVER THE TERRACE IN FRONT OF US BEYOND THE BEECH TREES
IT WAS A GLORIOUS SIGHT AND WAS RENDERED MORE STRIKING BY THE DARKNESS
WHICH SURROUNDED THE SPOT WHERE WE WERE
WE REMAINED FOR SOME TIME
SILENT WHEN CHARLOTTE OBSERVED WHENEVER I WALK BY MOONLIGHT IT
BRINGS TO MY REMEMBRANCE ALL MY BELOVED AND DEPARTED FRIENDS AND I
AM FILLED WITH THOUGHTS OF DEATH AND FUTURITY
WE SHALL LIVE AGAIN
WERTHER SHE CONTINUED WITH A FIRM BUT FEELING VOICE BUT SHALL WE
KNOW ONE ANOTHER AGAIN WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT DO YOU SAY
CHARLOTTE I SAID AS I TOOK HER HAND IN MINE AND MY EYES FILLED WITH
TEARS WE SHALL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN HERE AND HEREAFTER WE SHALL MEET
AGAIN I COULD SAY NO MORE
WHY WILHELM SHOULD SHE PUT THIS QUESTION
TO ME JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE FEAR OF OUR CRUEL SEPARATION FILLED
MY HEART
AND OH DO THOSE DEPARTED ONES KNOW HOW WE ARE EMPLOYED HERE DO THEY
KNOW WHEN WE ARE WELL AND HAPPY DO THEY KNOW WHEN WE RECALL THEIR
MEMORIES WITH THE FONDEST LOVE IN THE SILENT HOUR OF EVENING THE SHADE
OF MY MOTHER HOVERS AROUND ME WHEN SEATED IN THE MIDST OF MY CHILDREN
I SEE THEM ASSEMBLED NEAR ME AS THEY USED TO ASSEMBLE NEAR HER AND
THEN I RAISE MY ANXIOUS EYES TO HEAVEN AND WISH SHE COULD LOOK DOWN
UPON US AND WITNESS HOW I FULFIL THE PROMISE I MADE TO HER IN HER LAST
MOMENTS TO BE A MOTHER TO HER CHILDREN
WITH WHAT EMOTION DO I THEN
EXCLAIM 'PARDON DEAREST OF MOTHERS PARDON ME IF I DO NOT ADEQUATELY
SUPPLY YOUR PLACE ALAS I DO MY UTMOST
THEY ARE CLOTHED AND FED AND
STILL BETTER THEY ARE LOVED AND EDUCATED
COULD YOU BUT SEE SWEET
SAINT THE PEACE AND HARMONY THAT DWELLS AMONGST US YOU WOULD GLORIFY
GOD WITH THE WARMEST FEELINGS OF GRATITUDE TO WHOM IN YOUR LAST HOUR
YOU ADDRESSED SUCH FERVENT PRAYERS FOR OUR HAPPINESS THUS DID SHE
EXPRESS HERSELF BUT O WILHELM WHO CAN DO JUSTICE TO HER LANGUAGE HOW
CAN COLD AND PASSIONLESS WORDS CONVEY THE HEAVENLY EXPRESSIONS OF THE
SPIRIT ALBERT INTERRUPTED HER GENTLY
THIS AFFECTS YOU TOO DEEPLY
MY DEAR CHARLOTTE
I KNOW YOUR SOUL DWELLS ON SUCH RECOLLECTIONS WITH
INTENSE DELIGHT BUT I IMPLORE O ALBERT SHE CONTINUED I AM SURE
YOU DO NOT FORGET THE EVENINGS WHEN WE THREE USED TO SIT AT THE LITTLE
ROUND TABLE WHEN PAPA WAS ABSENT AND THE LITTLE ONES HAD RETIRED
YOU
OFTEN HAD A GOOD BOOK WITH YOU BUT SELDOM READ IT THE CONVERSATION OF
THAT NOBLE BEING WAS PREFERABLE TO EVERYTHING THAT BEAUTIFUL
BRIGHT GENTLE AND YET EVER TOILING WOMAN
GOD ALONE KNOWS HOW I HAVE
SUPPLICATED WITH TEARS ON MY NIGHTLY COUCH THAT I MIGHT BE LIKE HER
I THREW MYSELF AT HER FEET AND SEIZING HER HAND BEDEWED IT WITH
A THOUSAND TEARS
CHARLOTTE I EXCLAIMED GOD'S BLESSING AND YOUR
MOTHER'S SPIRIT ARE UPON YOU OH THAT YOU HAD KNOWN HER SHE SAID
WITH A WARM PRESSURE OF THE HAND
SHE WAS WORTHY OF BEING KNOWN TO
YOU I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE FAINTED NEVER HAD I RECEIVED PRAISE SO
FLATTERING
SHE CONTINUED AND YET SHE WAS DOOMED TO DIE IN THE FLOWER
OF HER YOUTH WHEN HER YOUNGEST CHILD WAS SCARCELY SIX MONTHS OLD
HER
ILLNESS WAS BUT SHORT BUT SHE WAS CALM AND RESIGNED AND IT WAS ONLY
FOR HER CHILDREN ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGEST THAT SHE FELT UNHAPPY
WHEN
HER END DREW NIGH SHE BADE ME BRING THEM TO HER
I OBEYED
THE YOUNGER
ONES KNEW NOTHING OF THEIR APPROACHING LOSS WHILE THE ELDER ONES WERE
QUITE OVERCOME WITH GRIEF
THEY STOOD AROUND THE BED AND SHE RAISED
HER FEEBLE HANDS TO HEAVEN AND PRAYED OVER THEM THEN KISSING THEM IN
TURN SHE DISMISSED THEM AND SAID TO ME 'BE YOU A MOTHER TO THEM
I GAVE HER MY HAND
'YOU ARE PROMISING MUCH MY CHILD SHE SAID 'A
MOTHER'S FONDNESS AND A MOTHER'S CARE I HAVE OFTEN WITNESSED BY YOUR
TEARS OF GRATITUDE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT IS A MOTHER'S TENDERNESS SHOW IT
TO YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND BE DUTIFUL AND FAITHFUL TO YOUR
FATHER AS A WIFE YOU WILL BE HIS COMFORT SHE INQUIRED FOR HIM
HE
HAD RETIRED TO CONCEAL HIS INTOLERABLE ANGUISH HE WAS HEARTBROKEN
'ALBERT YOU WERE IN THE ROOM SHE HEARD SOME ONE MOVING SHE INQUIRED
WHO IT WAS AND DESIRED YOU TO APPROACH
SHE SURVEYED US BOTH WITH A
LOOK OF COMPOSURE AND SATISFACTION EXPRESSIVE OF HER CONVICTION THAT
WE SHOULD BE HAPPY HAPPY WITH ONE ANOTHER ALBERT FELL UPON HER NECK
AND KISSED HER AND EXCLAIMED WE ARE SO AND WE SHALL BE SO EVEN
ALBERT GENERALLY SO TRANQUIL HAD QUITE LOST HIS COMPOSURE AND I WAS
EXCITED BEYOND EXPRESSION
AND SUCH A BEING SHE CONTINUED WAS TO LEAVE US WERTHER GREAT GOD
MUST WE THUS PART WITH EVERYTHING WE HOLD DEAR IN THIS WORLD NOBODY
FELT THIS MORE ACUTELY THAN THE CHILDREN THEY CRIED AND LAMENTED FOR
A LONG TIME AFTERWARD COMPLAINING THAT MEN HAD CARRIED AWAY THEIR DEAR
MAMMA
CHARLOTTE ROSE
IT AROUSED ME BUT I CONTINUED SITTING AND HELD HER
HAND
LET US GO SHE SAID IT GROWS LATE SHE ATTEMPTED TO WITHDRAW
HER HAND I HELD IT STILL
WE SHALL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN I EXCLAIMED
WE SHALL RECOGNISE EACH OTHER UNDER EVERY POSSIBLE CHANGE I AM GOING
I CONTINUED GOING WILLINGLY BUT SHOULD I SAY FOR EVER PERHAPS I MAY
NOT KEEP MY WORD
ADIEU CHARLOTTE ADIEU ALBERT
WE SHALL MEET AGAIN
YES TOMORROW I THINK SHE ANSWERED WITH A SMILE
TOMORROW HOW I
FELT THE WORD AH SHE LITTLE THOUGHT WHEN SHE DREW HER HAND AWAY FROM
MINE
THEY WALKED DOWN THE AVENUE
I STOOD GAZING AFTER THEM IN THE
MOONLIGHT
I THREW MYSELF UPON THE GROUND AND WEPT I THEN SPRANG
UP AND RAN OUT UPON THE TERRACE AND SAW UNDER THE SHADE OF THE
LINDEN TREES HER WHITE DRESS DISAPPEARING NEAR THE GARDEN GATE
I
STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS AND SHE VANISHED
BOOK II
OCTOBER 20
WE ARRIVED HERE YESTERDAY
THE AMBASSADOR IS INDISPOSED AND WILL NOT
GO OUT FOR SOME DAYS
IF HE WERE LESS PEEVISH AND MOROSE ALL WOULD
BE WELL
I SEE BUT TOO PLAINLY THAT HEAVEN HAS DESTINED ME TO SEVERE
TRIALS BUT COURAGE A LIGHT HEART MAY BEAR ANYTHING
A LIGHT HEART
I SMILE TO FIND SUCH A WORD PROCEEDING FROM MY PEN
A LITTLE MORE
LIGHTHEARTEDNESS WOULD RENDER ME THE HAPPIEST BEING UNDER THE SUN
BUT MUST I DESPAIR OF MY TALENTS AND FACULTIES WHILST OTHERS OF FAR
INFERIOR ABILITIES PARADE BEFORE ME WITH THE UTMOST SELF SATISFACTION
GRACIOUS PROVIDENCE TO WHOM I OWE ALL MY POWERS WHY DIDST THOU NOT
WITHHOLD SOME OF THOSE BLESSINGS I POSSESS AND SUBSTITUTE IN THEIR
PLACE A FEELING OF SELF CONFIDENCE AND CONTENTMENT
BUT PATIENCE ALL WILL YET BE WELL FOR I ASSURE YOU MY DEAR FRIEND
YOU WERE RIGHT SINCE I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO ASSOCIATE CONTINUALLY WITH
OTHER PEOPLE AND OBSERVE WHAT THEY DO AND HOW THEY EMPLOY THEMSELVES
I HAVE BECOME FAR BETTER SATISFIED WITH MYSELF
FOR WE ARE SO
CONSTITUTED BY NATURE THAT WE ARE EVER PRONE TO COMPARE OURSELVES WITH
OTHERS AND OUR HAPPINESS OR MISERY DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON THE OBJECTS
AND PERSONS AROUND US
ON THIS ACCOUNT NOTHING IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN
SOLITUDE THERE OUR IMAGINATION ALWAYS DISPOSED TO RISE TAKING A NEW
FLIGHT ON THE WINGS OF FANCY PICTURES TO US A CHAIN OF BEINGS OF WHOM
WE SEEM THE MOST INFERIOR
ALL THINGS APPEAR GREATER THAN THEY REALLY
ARE AND ALL SEEM SUPERIOR TO US
THIS OPERATION OF THE MIND IS QUITE
NATURAL WE SO CONTINUALLY FEEL OUR OWN IMPERFECTIONS AND FANCY WE
PERCEIVE IN OTHERS THE QUALITIES WE DO NOT POSSESS ATTRIBUTING TO THEM
ALSO ALL THAT WE ENJOY OURSELVES THAT BY THIS PROCESS WE FORM THE IDEA
OF A PERFECT HAPPY MAN A MAN HOWEVER WHO ONLY EXISTS IN OUR OWN
IMAGINATION
BUT WHEN IN SPITE OF WEAKNESS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS WE SET TO WORK IN
EARNEST AND PERSEVERE STEADILY WE OFTEN FIND THAT THOUGH OBLIGED
CONTINUALLY TO TACK WE MAKE MORE WAY THAN OTHERS WHO HAVE THE
ASSISTANCE OF WIND AND TIDE AND IN TRUTH THERE CAN BE NO GREATER
SATISFACTION THAN TO KEEP PACE WITH OTHERS OR OUTSTRIP THEM IN THE RACE
NOVEMBER 26
I BEGIN TO FIND MY SITUATION HERE MORE TOLERABLE CONSIDERING ALL
CIRCUMSTANCES
I FIND A GREAT ADVANTAGE IN BEING MUCH OCCUPIED AND THE
NUMBER OF PERSONS I MEET AND THEIR DIFFERENT PURSUITS CREATE A VARIED
ENTERTAINMENT FOR ME
I HAVE FORMED THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE COUNT
C AND I ESTEEM HIM MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY
HE IS A MAN OF STRONG
UNDERSTANDING AND GREAT DISCERNMENT BUT THOUGH HE SEES FARTHER THAN
OTHER PEOPLE HE IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT COLD IN HIS MANNER BUT CAPABLE
OF INSPIRING AND RETURNING THE WARMEST AFFECTION
HE APPEARED INTERESTED
IN ME ON ONE OCCASION WHEN I HAD TO TRANSACT SOME BUSINESS WITH HIM
HE
PERCEIVED AT THE FIRST WORD THAT WE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER AND THAT
HE COULD CONVERSE WITH ME IN A DIFFERENT TONE FROM WHAT HE USED WITH
OTHERS
I CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY ESTEEM HIS FRANK AND OPEN KINDNESS TO ME
IT IS THE GREATEST AND MOST GENUINE OF PLEASURES TO OBSERVE A GREAT MIND
IN SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN
DECEMBER 24
AS I ANTICIPATED THE AMBASSADOR OCCASIONS ME INFINITE ANNOYANCE
HE IS
THE MOST PUNCTILIOUS BLOCKHEAD UNDER HEAVEN
HE DOES EVERYTHING STEP BY
STEP WITH THE TRIFLING MINUTENESS OF AN OLD WOMAN AND HE IS A MAN WHOM
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE BECAUSE HE IS NEVER PLEASED WITH HIMSELF
I
LIKE TO DO BUSINESS REGULARLY AND CHEERFULLY AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED
TO LEAVE IT
BUT HE CONSTANTLY RETURNS MY PAPERS TO ME SAYING THEY
WILL DO BUT RECOMMENDING ME TO LOOK OVER THEM AGAIN AS ONE MAY
ALWAYS IMPROVE BY USING A BETTER WORD OR A MORE APPROPRIATE PARTICLE
I THEN LOSE ALL PATIENCE AND WISH MYSELF AT THE DEVIL'S
NOT A
CONJUNCTION NOT AN ADVERB MUST BE OMITTED HE HAS A DEADLY ANTIPATHY
TO ALL THOSE TRANSPOSITIONS OF WHICH I AM SO FOND AND IF THE MUSIC
OF OUR PERIODS IS NOT TUNED TO THE ESTABLISHED OFFICIAL KEY HE CANNOT
COMPREHEND OUR MEANING
IT IS DEPLORABLE TO BE CONNECTED WITH SUCH A
FELLOW
MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE COUNT C IS THE ONLY COMPENSATION FOR SUCH AN
EVIL
HE TOLD ME FRANKLY THE OTHER DAY THAT HE WAS MUCH DISPLEASED
WITH THE DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS OF THE AMBASSADOR THAT PEOPLE LIKE HIM
ARE OBSTACLES BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND TO OTHERS
BUT ADDED HE ONE
MUST SUBMIT LIKE A TRAVELLER WHO HAS TO ASCEND A MOUNTAIN IF THE
MOUNTAIN WAS NOT THERE THE ROAD WOULD BE BOTH SHORTER AND PLEASANTER
BUT THERE IT IS AND HE MUST GET OVER IT
THE OLD MAN PERCEIVES THE COUNT'S PARTIALITY FOR ME THIS ANNOYS HIM
AND HE SEIZES EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO DEPRECIATE THE COUNT IN MY HEARING
I NATURALLY DEFEND HIM AND THAT ONLY MAKES MATTERS WORSE
YESTERDAY HE
MADE ME INDIGNANT FOR HE ALSO ALLUDED TO ME
THE COUNT HE SAID IS
A MAN OF THE WORLD AND A GOOD MAN OF BUSINESS HIS STYLE IS GOOD
AND HE WRITES WITH FACILITY BUT LIKE OTHER GENIUSES HE HAS NO SOLID
LEARNING HE LOOKED AT ME WITH AN EXPRESSION THAT SEEMED TO ASK IF I
FELT THE BLOW
BUT IT DID NOT PRODUCE THE DESIRED EFFECT I DESPISE A
MAN WHO CAN THINK AND ACT IN SUCH A MANNER
HOWEVER I MADE A STAND AND
ANSWERED WITH NOT A LITTLE WARMTH
THE COUNT I SAID WAS A MAN ENTITLED
TO RESPECT ALIKE FOR HIS CHARACTER AND HIS ACQUIREMENTS
I HAD NEVER
MET A PERSON WHOSE MIND WAS STORED WITH MORE USEFUL AND EXTENSIVE
KNOWLEDGE WHO HAD IN FACT MASTERED SUCH AN INFINITE VARIETY OF
SUBJECTS AND WHO YET RETAINED ALL HIS ACTIVITY FOR THE DETAILS OF
ORDINARY BUSINESS
THIS WAS ALTOGETHER BEYOND HIS COMPREHENSION AND I
TOOK MY LEAVE LEST MY ANGER SHOULD BE TOO HIGHLY EXCITED BY SOME NEW
ABSURDITY OF HIS
AND YOU ARE TO BLAME FOR ALL THIS YOU WHO PERSUADED ME TO BEND MY
NECK TO THIS YOKE BY PREACHING A LIFE OF ACTIVITY TO ME
IF THE MAN WHO
PLANTS VEGETABLES AND CARRIES HIS CORN TO TOWN ON MARKET DAYS IS NOT
MORE USEFULLY EMPLOYED THAN I AM THEN LET ME WORK TEN YEARS LONGER AT
THE GALLEYS TO WHICH I AM NOW CHAINED
OH THE BRILLIANT WRETCHEDNESS THE WEARINESS THAT ONE IS DOOMED
TO WITNESS AMONG THE SILLY PEOPLE WHOM WE MEET IN SOCIETY HERE THE
AMBITION OF RANK HOW THEY WATCH HOW THEY TOIL TO GAIN PRECEDENCE
WHAT POOR AND CONTEMPTIBLE PASSIONS ARE DISPLAYED IN THEIR UTTER
NAKEDNESS WE HAVE A WOMAN HERE FOR EXAMPLE WHO NEVER CEASES TO
ENTERTAIN THE COMPANY WITH ACCOUNTS OF HER FAMILY AND HER ESTATES
ANY
STRANGER WOULD CONSIDER HER A SILLY BEING WHOSE HEAD WAS TURNED BY
HER PRETENSIONS TO RANK AND PROPERTY BUT SHE IS IN REALITY EVEN
MORE RIDICULOUS THE DAUGHTER OF A MERE MAGISTRATE'S CLERK FROM THIS
NEIGHBOURHOOD
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW HUMAN BEINGS CAN SO DEBASE
THEMSELVES
EVERY DAY I OBSERVE MORE AND MORE THE FOLLY OF JUDGING OF OTHERS BY
OURSELVES AND I HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH MYSELF AND MY OWN HEART IS
IN SUCH CONSTANT AGITATION THAT I AM WELL CONTENT TO LET OTHERS PURSUE
THEIR OWN COURSE IF THEY ONLY ALLOW ME THE SAME PRIVILEGE
WHAT PROVOKES ME MOST IS THE UNHAPPY EXTENT TO WHICH DISTINCTIONS OF
RANK ARE CARRIED
I KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW NECESSARY ARE INEQUALITIES
OF CONDITION AND I AM SENSIBLE OF THE ADVANTAGES I MYSELF DERIVE
THEREFROM BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE THESE INSTITUTIONS PROVE A BARRIER TO
THE SMALL CHANCE OF HAPPINESS WHICH I MAY ENJOY ON THIS EARTH
I HAVE LATELY BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH A MISS B A VERY AGREEABLE GIRL
WHO HAS RETAINED HER NATURAL MANNERS IN THE MIDST OF ARTIFICIAL LIFE
OUR FIRST CONVERSATION PLEASED US BOTH EQUALLY AND AT TAKING LEAVE
I REQUESTED PERMISSION TO VISIT HER
SHE CONSENTED IN SO OBLIGING A
MANNER THAT I WAITED WITH IMPATIENCE FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE HAPPY
MOMENT
SHE IS NOT A NATIVE OF THIS PLACE BUT RESIDES HERE WITH HER
AUNT
THE COUNTENANCE OF THE OLD LADY IS NOT PREPOSSESSING
I PAID HER
MUCH ATTENTION ADDRESSING THE GREATER PART OF MY CONVERSATION TO HER
AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR I DISCOVERED WHAT HER NIECE SUBSEQUENTLY
ACKNOWLEDGED TO ME THAT HER AGED AUNT HAVING BUT A SMALL FORTUNE AND
A STILL SMALLER SHARE OF UNDERSTANDING ENJOYS NO SATISFACTION EXCEPT
IN THE PEDIGREE OF HER ANCESTORS NO PROTECTION SAVE IN HER NOBLE BIRTH
AND NO ENJOYMENT BUT IN LOOKING FROM HER CASTLE OVER THE HEADS OF THE
HUMBLE CITIZENS
SHE WAS NO DOUBT HANDSOME IN HER YOUTH AND IN HER
EARLY YEARS PROBABLY TRIFLED AWAY HER TIME IN RENDERING MANY A POOR
YOUTH THE SPORT OF HER CAPRICE IN HER RIPER YEARS SHE HAS SUBMITTED
TO THE YOKE OF A VETERAN OFFICER WHO IN RETURN FOR HER PERSON AND HER
SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAS SPENT WITH HER WHAT WE MAY DESIGNATE HER AGE OF
BRASS
HE IS DEAD AND SHE IS NOW A WIDOW AND DESERTED
SHE SPENDS HER
IRON AGE ALONE AND WOULD NOT BE APPROACHED EXCEPT FOR THE LOVELINESS
OF HER NIECE
JANUARY 8 1772
WHAT BEINGS ARE MEN WHOSE WHOLE THOUGHTS ARE OCCUPIED WITH FORM AND
CEREMONY WHO FOR YEARS TOGETHER DEVOTE THEIR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL
EXERTIONS TO THE TASK OF ADVANCING THEMSELVES BUT ONE STEP AND
ENDEAVOURING TO OCCUPY A HIGHER PLACE AT THE TABLE
NOT THAT SUCH
PERSONS WOULD OTHERWISE WANT EMPLOYMENT ON THE CONTRARY THEY GIVE
THEMSELVES MUCH TROUBLE BY NEGLECTING IMPORTANT BUSINESS FOR SUCH PETTY
TRIFLES
LAST WEEK A QUESTION OF PRECEDENCE AROSE AT A SLEDGING PARTY
AND ALL OUR AMUSEMENT WAS SPOILED
THE SILLY CREATURES CANNOT SEE THAT IT IS NOT PLACE WHICH CONSTITUTES
REAL GREATNESS SINCE THE MAN WHO OCCUPIES THE FIRST PLACE BUT
SELDOM PLAYS THE PRINCIPAL PART
HOW MANY KINGS ARE GOVERNED BY THEIR
MINISTERS HOW MANY MINISTERS BY THEIR SECRETARIES WHO IN SUCH CASES
IS REALLY THE CHIEF HE AS IT SEEMS TO ME WHO CAN SEE THROUGH THE
OTHERS AND POSSESSES STRENGTH OR SKILL ENOUGH TO MAKE THEIR POWER OR
PASSIONS SUBSERVIENT TO THE EXECUTION OF HIS OWN DESIGNS
JANUARY 20
I MUST WRITE TO YOU FROM THIS PLACE MY DEAR CHARLOTTE FROM A SMALL
ROOM IN A COUNTRY INN WHERE I HAVE TAKEN SHELTER FROM A SEVERE STORM
DURING MY WHOLE RESIDENCE IN THAT WRETCHED PLACE D WHERE I LIVED
AMONGST STRANGERS STRANGERS INDEED TO THIS HEART I NEVER AT ANY
TIME FELT THE SMALLEST INCLINATION TO CORRESPOND WITH YOU BUT IN THIS
COTTAGE IN THIS RETIREMENT IN THIS SOLITUDE WITH THE SNOW AND HAIL
BEATING AGAINST MY LATTICE PANE YOU ARE MY FIRST THOUGHT
THE INSTANT
I ENTERED YOUR FIGURE ROSE UP BEFORE ME AND THE REMEMBRANCE O MY
CHARLOTTE THE SACRED TENDER REMEMBRANCE GRACIOUS HEAVEN RESTORE TO
ME THE HAPPY MOMENT OF OUR FIRST ACQUAINTANCE
COULD YOU BUT SEE ME MY DEAR CHARLOTTE IN THE WHIRL OF
DISSIPATION HOW MY SENSES ARE DRIED UP BUT MY HEART IS AT NO TIME
FULL
I ENJOY NO SINGLE MOMENT OF HAPPINESS ALL IS VAIN NOTHING
TOUCHES ME
I STAND AS IT WERE BEFORE THE RAREE SHOW I SEE THE LITTLE
PUPPETS MOVE AND I ASK WHETHER IT IS NOT AN OPTICAL ILLUSION
I AM
AMUSED WITH THESE PUPPETS OR RATHER I AM MYSELF ONE OF THEM BUT
WHEN I SOMETIMES GRASP MY NEIGHBOUR'S HAND I FEEL THAT IT IS NOT
NATURAL AND I WITHDRAW MINE WITH A SHUDDER
IN THE EVENING I SAY I WILL
ENJOY THE NEXT MORNING'S SUNRISE AND YET I REMAIN IN BED IN THE DAY I
PROMISE TO RAMBLE BY MOONLIGHT AND I NEVERTHELESS REMAIN AT HOME
I
KNOW NOT WHY I RISE NOR WHY I GO TO SLEEP
THE LEAVEN WHICH ANIMATED MY EXISTENCE IS GONE THE CHARM WHICH CHEERED
ME IN THE GLOOM OF NIGHT AND AROUSED ME FROM MY MORNING SLUMBERS IS
FOR EVER FLED
I HAVE FOUND BUT ONE BEING HERE TO INTEREST ME A MISS B
SHE
RESEMBLES YOU MY DEAR CHARLOTTE IF ANY ONE CAN POSSIBLY RESEMBLE YOU
AH YOU WILL SAY HE HAS LEARNED HOW TO PAY FINE COMPLIMENTS AND
THIS IS PARTLY TRUE
I HAVE BEEN VERY AGREEABLE LATELY AS IT WAS NOT
IN MY POWER TO BE OTHERWISE
I HAVE MOREOVER A DEAL OF WIT AND THE
LADIES SAY THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS FLATTERY BETTER OR FALSEHOODS YOU
WILL ADD SINCE THE ONE ACCOMPLISHMENT INVARIABLY ACCOMPANIES THE
OTHER
BUT I MUST TELL YOU OF MISS B
SHE HAS ABUNDANCE OF SOUL
WHICH FLASHES FROM HER DEEP BLUE EYES
HER RANK IS A TORMENT TO HER AND
SATISFIES NO ONE DESIRE OF HER HEART
SHE WOULD GLADLY RETIRE FROM
THIS WHIRL OF FASHION AND WE OFTEN PICTURE TO OURSELVES A LIFE OF
UNDISTURBED HAPPINESS IN DISTANT SCENES OF RURAL RETIREMENT AND THEN WE
SPEAK OF YOU MY DEAR CHARLOTTE FOR SHE KNOWS YOU AND RENDERS HOMAGE
TO YOUR MERITS BUT HER HOMAGE IS NOT EXACTED BUT VOLUNTARY SHE LOVES
YOU AND DELIGHTS TO HEAR YOU MADE THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION
OH THAT I WERE SITTING AT YOUR FEET IN YOUR FAVOURITE LITTLE ROOM WITH
THE DEAR CHILDREN PLAYING AROUND US IF THEY BECAME TROUBLESOME TO YOU
I WOULD TELL THEM SOME APPALLING GOBLIN STORY AND THEY WOULD CROWD
ROUND ME WITH SILENT ATTENTION
THE SUN IS SETTING IN GLORY HIS LAST
RAYS ARE SHINING ON THE SNOW WHICH COVERS THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY THE
STORM IS OVER AND I MUST RETURN TO MY DUNGEON
ADIEU IS ALBERT WITH
YOU AND WHAT IS HE TO YOU GOD FORGIVE THE QUESTION
FEBRUARY 8
FOR A WEEK PAST WE HAVE HAD THE MOST WRETCHED WEATHER BUT THIS TO ME
IS A BLESSING FOR DURING MY RESIDENCE HERE NOT A SINGLE FINE DAY HAS
BEAMED FROM THE HEAVENS BUT HAS BEEN LOST TO ME BY THE INTRUSION
OF SOMEBODY
DURING THE SEVERITY OF RAIN SLEET FROST AND STORM I
CONGRATULATE MYSELF THAT IT CANNOT BE WORSE INDOORS THAN ABROAD NOR
WORSE ABROAD THAN IT IS WITHIN DOORS AND SO I BECOME RECONCILED
WHEN
THE SUN RISES BRIGHT IN THE MORNING AND PROMISES A GLORIOUS DAY I
NEVER OMIT TO EXCLAIM THERE NOW THEY HAVE ANOTHER BLESSING
FROM HEAVEN WHICH THEY WILL BE SURE TO DESTROY THEY SPOIL
EVERYTHING HEALTH FAME HAPPINESS AMUSEMENT AND THEY DO THIS
GENERALLY THROUGH FOLLY IGNORANCE OR IMBECILITY AND ALWAYS ACCORDING
TO THEIR OWN ACCOUNT WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS I COULD OFTEN
BESEECH THEM ON MY BENDED KNEES TO BE LESS RESOLVED UPON THEIR OWN
DESTRUCTION
FEBRUARY 17
I FEAR THAT MY AMBASSADOR AND I SHALL NOT CONTINUE MUCH LONGER TOGETHER
HE IS REALLY GROWING PAST ENDURANCE
HE TRANSACTS HIS BUSINESS IN SO
RIDICULOUS A MANNER THAT I AM OFTEN COMPELLED TO CONTRADICT HIM AND DO
THINGS MY OWN WAY AND THEN OF COURSE HE THINKS THEM VERY ILL DONE
HE
COMPLAINED OF ME LATELY ON THIS ACCOUNT AT COURT AND THE MINISTER GAVE
ME A REPRIMAND A GENTLE ONE IT IS TRUE BUT STILL A REPRIMAND
IN
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS I WAS ABOUT TO TENDER MY RESIGNATION WHEN I
RECEIVED A LETTER TO WHICH I SUBMITTED WITH GREAT RESPECT ON
ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH NOBLE AND GENEROUS SPIRIT WHICH DICTATED IT
HE
ENDEAVOURED TO SOOTHE MY EXCESSIVE SENSIBILITY PAID A TRIBUTE TO MY
EXTREME IDEAS OF DUTY OF GOOD EXAMPLE AND OF PERSEVERANCE IN BUSINESS
AS THE FRUIT OF MY YOUTHFUL ARDOUR AN IMPULSE WHICH HE DID NOT SEEK
TO DESTROY BUT ONLY TO MODERATE THAT IT MIGHT HAVE PROPER PLAY AND BE
PRODUCTIVE OF GOOD
SO NOW I AM AT REST FOR ANOTHER WEEK AND NO LONGER
AT VARIANCE WITH MYSELF
CONTENT AND PEACE OF MIND ARE VALUABLE THINGS
I COULD WISH MY DEAR FRIEND THAT THESE PRECIOUS JEWELS WERE LESS
TRANSITORY
FEBRUARY 20
GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR FRIENDS AND MAY HE GRANT YOU THAT HAPPINESS
WHICH HE DENIES TO ME
I THANK YOU ALBERT FOR HAVING DECEIVED ME
I WAITED FOR THE NEWS THAT
YOUR WEDDING DAY WAS FIXED AND I INTENDED ON THAT DAY WITH SOLEMNITY
TO TAKE DOWN CHARLOTTE'S PROFILE FROM THE WALL AND TO BURY IT WITH
SOME OTHER PAPERS I POSSESS
YOU ARE NOW UNITED AND HER PICTURE STILL
REMAINS HERE
WELL LET IT REMAIN WHY SHOULD IT NOT I KNOW THAT I
AM STILL ONE OF YOUR SOCIETY THAT I STILL OCCUPY A PLACE UNINJURED IN
CHARLOTTE'S HEART THAT I HOLD THE SECOND PLACE THEREIN AND I INTEND
TO KEEP IT
OH I SHOULD BECOME MAD IF SHE COULD FORGET ALBERT THAT
THOUGHT IS HELL FAREWELL ALBERT FAREWELL ANGEL OF HEAVEN FAREWELL
CHARLOTTE
MARCH 15
I HAVE JUST HAD A SAD ADVENTURE WHICH WILL DRIVE ME AWAY FROM HERE
I
LOSE ALL PATIENCE DEATH IT IS NOT TO BE REMEDIED AND YOU ALONE ARE
TO BLAME FOR YOU URGED AND IMPELLED ME TO FILL A POST FOR WHICH I WAS
BY NO MEANS SUITED
I HAVE NOW REASON TO BE SATISFIED AND SO HAVE YOU
BUT THAT YOU MAY NOT AGAIN ATTRIBUTE THIS FATALITY TO MY IMPETUOUS
TEMPER I SEND YOU MY DEAR SIR A PLAIN AND SIMPLE NARRATION OF THE
AFFAIR AS A MERE CHRONICLER OF FACTS WOULD DESCRIBE IT
THE COUNT OF O LIKES AND DISTINGUISHES ME
IT IS WELL KNOWN AND I HAVE
MENTIONED THIS TO YOU A HUNDRED TIMES
YESTERDAY I DINED WITH HIM
IT IS
THE DAY ON WHICH THE NOBILITY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO ASSEMBLE AT HIS HOUSE
IN THE EVENING
I NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF THE ASSEMBLY NOR THAT WE
SUBALTERNS DID NOT BELONG TO SUCH SOCIETY
WELL I DINED WITH THE COUNT
AND AFTER DINNER WE ADJOURNED TO THE LARGE HALL
WE WALKED UP AND DOWN
TOGETHER AND I CONVERSED WITH HIM AND WITH COLONEL B WHO JOINED US
AND IN THIS MANNER THE HOUR FOR THE ASSEMBLY APPROACHED
GOD KNOWS I
WAS THINKING OF NOTHING WHEN WHO SHOULD ENTER BUT THE HONOURABLE LADY
ACCOMPANIED BY HER NOBLE HUSBAND AND THEIR SILLY SCHEMING DAUGHTER
WITH HER SMALL WAIST AND FLAT NECK AND WITH DISDAINFUL LOOKS AND A
HAUGHTY AIR THEY PASSED ME BY
AS I HEARTILY DETEST THE WHOLE RACE
I DETERMINED UPON GOING AWAY AND ONLY WAITED TILL THE COUNT HAD
DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THEIR IMPERTINENT PRATTLE TO TAKE LEAVE WHEN
THE AGREEABLE MISS B CAME IN
AS I NEVER MEET HER WITHOUT EXPERIENCING
A HEARTFELT PLEASURE I STAYED AND TALKED TO HER LEANING OVER THE
BACK OF HER CHAIR AND DID NOT PERCEIVE TILL AFTER SOME TIME THAT SHE
SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND CEASED TO ANSWER ME WITH HER USUAL EASE
OF MANNER
I WAS STRUCK WITH IT
HEAVENS I SAID TO MYSELF CAN SHE
TOO BE LIKE THE REST I FELT ANNOYED AND WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW BUT I
REMAINED NOTWITHSTANDING FORMING EXCUSES FOR HER CONDUCT FANCYING SHE
DID NOT MEAN IT AND STILL HOPING TO RECEIVE SOME FRIENDLY RECOGNITION
THE REST OF THE COMPANY NOW ARRIVED
THERE WAS THE BARON F IN AN
ENTIRE SUIT THAT DATED FROM THE CORONATION OF FRANCIS I THE CHANCELLOR
N WITH HIS DEAF WIFE THE SHABBILY DRESSED I WHOSE OLD FASHIONED
COAT BORE EVIDENCE OF MODERN REPAIRS THIS CROWNED THE WHOLE
I CONVERSED WITH SOME OF MY ACQUAINTANCES BUT THEY ANSWERED ME
LACONICALLY
I WAS ENGAGED IN OBSERVING MISS B AND DID NOT NOTICE
THAT THE WOMEN WERE WHISPERING AT THE END OF THE ROOM THAT THE MURMUR
EXTENDED BY DEGREES TO THE MEN THAT MADAME S ADDRESSED THE COUNT WITH
MUCH WARMTH THIS WAS ALL RELATED TO ME SUBSEQUENTLY BY MISS B TILL
AT LENGTH THE COUNT CAME UP TO ME AND TOOK ME TO THE WINDOW
YOU KNOW
OUR RIDICULOUS CUSTOMS HE SAID
I PERCEIVE THE COMPANY IS RATHER
DISPLEASED AT YOUR BEING HERE
I WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT I BEG
YOUR EXCELLENCY'S PARDON I EXCLAIMED
I OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF
THIS BEFORE BUT I KNOW YOU WILL FORGIVE THIS LITTLE INATTENTION
I WAS
GOING I ADDED SOME TIME AGO BUT MY EVIL GENIUS DETAINED ME AND I
SMILED AND BOWED TO TAKE MY LEAVE
HE SHOOK ME BY THE HAND IN A MANNER
WHICH EXPRESSED EVERYTHING
I HASTENED AT ONCE FROM THE ILLUSTRIOUS
ASSEMBLY SPRANG INTO A CARRIAGE AND DROVE TO M
I CONTEMPLATED THE
SETTING SUN FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL AND READ THAT BEAUTIFUL PASSAGE IN
HOMER WHERE ULYSSES IS ENTERTAINED BY THE HOSPITABLE HERDSMEN
THIS WAS
INDEED DELIGHTFUL
I RETURNED HOME TO SUPPER IN THE EVENING
BUT FEW PERSONS WERE ASSEMBLED
IN THE ROOM
THEY HAD TURNED UP A CORNER OF THE TABLE CLOTH AND WERE
PLAYING AT DICE
THE GOOD NATURED A CAME IN
HE LAID DOWN HIS HAT WHEN
HE SAW ME APPROACHED ME AND SAID IN A LOW TONE YOU HAVE MET WITH
A DISAGREEABLE ADVENTURE I I EXCLAIMED
THE COUNT OBLIGED YOU TO
WITHDRAW FROM THE ASSEMBLY DEUCE TAKE THE ASSEMBLY SAID I
I WAS
VERY GLAD TO BE GONE I AM DELIGHTED HE ADDED THAT YOU TAKE IT
SO LIGHTLY
I AM ONLY SORRY THAT IT IS ALREADY SO MUCH SPOKEN OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCE THEN BEGAN TO PAIN ME
I FANCIED THAT EVERY ONE WHO SAT
DOWN AND EVEN LOOKED AT ME WAS THINKING OF THIS INCIDENT AND MY HEART
BECAME EMBITTERED
AND NOW I COULD PLUNGE A DAGGER INTO MY BOSOM WHEN I HEAR MYSELF
EVERYWHERE PITIED AND OBSERVE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMIES WHO SAY THAT
THIS IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH VAIN PERSONS WHOSE HEADS ARE TURNED WITH
CONCEIT WHO AFFECT TO DESPISE FORMS AND SUCH PETTY IDLE NONSENSE
SAY WHAT YOU WILL OF FORTITUDE BUT SHOW ME THE MAN WHO CAN PATIENTLY
ENDURE THE LAUGHTER OF FOOLS WHEN THEY HAVE OBTAINED AN ADVANTAGE OVER
HIM
'TIS ONLY WHEN THEIR NONSENSE IS WITHOUT FOUNDATION THAT ONE CAN
SUFFER IT WITHOUT COMPLAINT
MARCH 16
EVERYTHING CONSPIRES AGAINST ME
I MET MISS B WALKING TO DAY
I COULD
NOT HELP JOINING HER AND WHEN WE WERE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM HER
COMPANIONS I EXPRESSED MY SENSE OF HER ALTERED MANNER TOWARD ME
O
WERTHER SHE SAID IN A TONE OF EMOTION YOU WHO KNOW MY HEART HOW
COULD YOU SO ILL INTERPRET MY DISTRESS WHAT DID I NOT SUFFER FOR YOU
FROM THE MOMENT YOU ENTERED THE ROOM I FORESAW IT ALL A HUNDRED TIMES
WAS I ON THE POINT OF MENTIONING IT TO YOU
I KNEW THAT THE S S AND
T S WITH THEIR HUSBANDS WOULD QUIT THE ROOM RATHER THAN REMAIN IN
YOUR COMPANY
I KNEW THAT THE COUNT WOULD NOT BREAK WITH THEM AND
NOW SO MUCH IS SAID ABOUT IT HOW I EXCLAIMED AND ENDEAVOURED TO
CONCEAL MY EMOTION FOR ALL THAT ADELIN HAD MENTIONED TO ME YESTERDAY
RECURRED TO ME PAINFULLY AT THAT MOMENT
OH HOW MUCH IT HAS ALREADY
COST ME SAID THIS AMIABLE GIRL WHILE HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
I COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN MYSELF AND WAS READY TO THROW MYSELF AT HER
FEET
EXPLAIN YOURSELF I CRIED
TEARS FLOWED DOWN HER CHEEKS
I
BECAME QUITE FRANTIC
SHE WIPED THEM AWAY WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL
THEM
YOU KNOW MY AUNT SHE CONTINUED SHE WAS PRESENT AND IN
WHAT LIGHT DOES SHE CONSIDER THE AFFAIR LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING
WERTHER I WAS COMPELLED TO LISTEN TO A LECTURE UPON MY ACQUAINTANCE
WITH YOU
I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO HEAR YOU CONDEMNED AND DEPRECIATED AND
I COULD NOT I DARED NOT SAY MUCH IN YOUR DEFENCE
EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED WAS A DAGGER TO MY HEART
SHE DID NOT FEEL WHAT A
MERCY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO CONCEAL EVERYTHING FROM ME
SHE TOLD ME IN
ADDITION ALL THE IMPERTINENCE THAT WOULD BE FURTHER CIRCULATED AND HOW
THE MALICIOUS WOULD TRIUMPH HOW THEY WOULD REJOICE OVER THE PUNISHMENT
OF MY PRIDE OVER MY HUMILIATION FOR THAT WANT OF ESTEEM FOR OTHERS WITH
WHICH I HAD OFTEN BEEN REPROACHED
TO HEAR ALL THIS WILHELM UTTERED BY
HER IN A VOICE OF THE MOST SINCERE SYMPATHY AWAKENED ALL MY PASSIONS
AND I AM STILL IN A STATE OF EXTREME EXCITEMENT
I WISH I COULD FIND A
MAN TO JEER ME ABOUT THIS EVENT
I WOULD SACRIFICE HIM TO MY RESENTMENT
THE SIGHT OF HIS BLOOD MIGHT POSSIBLY BE A RELIEF TO MY FURY
A HUNDRED
TIMES HAVE I SEIZED A DAGGER TO GIVE EASE TO THIS OPPRESSED HEART
NATURALISTS TELL OF A NOBLE RACE OF HORSES THAT INSTINCTIVELY OPEN A
VEIN WITH THEIR TEETH WHEN HEATED AND EXHAUSTED BY A LONG COURSE IN
ORDER TO BREATHE MORE FREELY
I AM OFTEN TEMPTED TO OPEN A VEIN TO
PROCURE FOR MYSELF EVERLASTING LIBERTY
MARCH 24
I HAVE TENDERED MY RESIGNATION TO THE COURT
I HOPE IT WILL BE ACCEPTED
AND YOU WILL FORGIVE ME FOR NOT HAVING PREVIOUSLY CONSULTED YOU
IT
IS NECESSARY I SHOULD LEAVE THIS PLACE
I KNOW ALL YOU WILL URGE ME TO
STAY AND THEREFORE I BEG YOU WILL SOFTEN THIS NEWS TO MY MOTHER
I AM
UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR MYSELF HOW THEN SHOULD I BE COMPETENT TO
ASSIST OTHERS IT WILL AFFLICT HER THAT I SHOULD HAVE INTERRUPTED THAT
CAREER WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE ME FIRST A PRIVY COUNCILLOR AND THEN
MINISTER AND THAT I SHOULD LOOK BEHIND ME IN PLACE OF ADVANCING
ARGUE
AS YOU WILL COMBINE ALL THE REASONS WHICH SHOULD HAVE INDUCED ME
TO REMAIN I AM GOING THAT IS SUFFICIENT
BUT THAT YOU MAY NOT BE
IGNORANT OF MY DESTINATION I MAY MENTION THAT THE PRINCE OF IS HERE
HE IS MUCH PLEASED WITH MY COMPANY AND HAVING HEARD OF MY INTENTION
TO RESIGN HE HAS INVITED ME TO HIS COUNTRY HOUSE TO PASS THE SPRING
MONTHS WITH HIM
I SHALL BE LEFT COMPLETELY MY OWN MASTER AND AS WE
AGREE ON ALL SUBJECTS BUT ONE I SHALL TRY MY FORTUNE AND ACCOMPANY
HIM
APRIL 19
THANKS FOR BOTH YOUR LETTERS
I DELAYED MY REPLY AND WITHHELD THIS
LETTER TILL I SHOULD OBTAIN AN ANSWER FROM THE COURT
I FEARED MY
MOTHER MIGHT APPLY TO THE MINISTER TO DEFEAT MY PURPOSE
BUT MY REQUEST
IS GRANTED MY RESIGNATION IS ACCEPTED
I SHALL NOT RECOUNT WITH WHAT
RELUCTANCE IT WAS ACCORDED NOR RELATE WHAT THE MINISTER HAS WRITTEN
YOU WOULD ONLY RENEW YOUR LAMENTATIONS
THE CROWN PRINCE HAS SENT ME
A PRESENT OF FIVE AND TWENTY DUCATS AND INDEED SUCH GOODNESS HAS
AFFECTED ME TO TEARS
FOR THIS REASON I SHALL NOT REQUIRE FROM MY MOTHER
THE MONEY FOR WHICH I LATELY APPLIED
MAY 5
I LEAVE THIS PLACE TO MORROW AND AS MY NATIVE PLACE IS ONLY SIX MILES
FROM THE HIGH ROAD I INTEND TO VISIT IT ONCE MORE AND RECALL THE HAPPY
DREAMS OF MY CHILDHOOD
I SHALL ENTER AT THE SAME GATE THROUGH WHICH
I CAME WITH MY MOTHER WHEN AFTER MY FATHER'S DEATH SHE LEFT THAT
DELIGHTFUL RETREAT TO IMMURE HERSELF IN YOUR MELANCHOLY TOWN
ADIEU MY
DEAR FRIEND YOU SHALL HEAR OF MY FUTURE CAREER
MAY 9
I HAVE PAID MY VISIT TO MY NATIVE PLACE WITH ALL THE DEVOTION OF A
PILGRIM AND HAVE EXPERIENCED MANY UNEXPECTED EMOTIONS
NEAR THE GREAT
ELM TREE WHICH IS A QUARTER OF A LEAGUE FROM THE VILLAGE I GOT OUT OF
THE CARRIAGE AND SENT IT ON BEFORE THAT ALONE AND ON FOOT I MIGHT
ENJOY VIVIDLY AND HEARTILY ALL THE PLEASURE OF MY RECOLLECTIONS
I STOOD
THERE UNDER THAT SAME ELM WHICH WAS FORMERLY THE TERM AND OBJECT OF MY
WALKS
HOW THINGS HAVE SINCE CHANGED THEN IN HAPPY IGNORANCE I SIGHED
FOR A WORLD I DID NOT KNOW WHERE I HOPED TO FIND EVERY PLEASURE AND
ENJOYMENT WHICH MY HEART COULD DESIRE AND NOW ON MY RETURN FROM THAT
WIDE WORLD O MY FRIEND HOW MANY DISAPPOINTED HOPES AND UNSUCCESSFUL
PLANS HAVE I BROUGHT BACK
AS I CONTEMPLATED THE MOUNTAINS WHICH LAY STRETCHED OUT BEFORE ME I
THOUGHT HOW OFTEN THEY HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF MY DEAREST DESIRES
HERE
USED I TO SIT FOR HOURS TOGETHER WITH MY EYES BENT UPON THEM ARDENTLY
LONGING TO WANDER IN THE SHADE OF THOSE WOODS TO LOSE MYSELF IN THOSE
VALLEYS WHICH FORM SO DELIGHTFUL AN OBJECT IN THE DISTANCE
WITH WHAT
RELUCTANCE DID I LEAVE THIS CHARMING SPOT WHEN MY HOUR OF RECREATION
WAS OVER AND MY LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXPIRED I DREW NEAR TO THE VILLAGE
ALL THE WELL KNOWN OLD SUMMERHOUSES AND GARDENS WERE RECOGNISED AGAIN I
DISLIKED THE NEW ONES AND ALL OTHER ALTERATIONS WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE
I ENTERED THE VILLAGE AND ALL MY FORMER FEELINGS RETURNED
I CANNOT
MY DEAR FRIEND ENTER INTO DETAILS CHARMING AS WERE MY SENSATIONS
THEY WOULD BE DULL IN THE NARRATION
I HAD INTENDED TO LODGE IN THE
MARKET PLACE NEAR OUR OLD HOUSE
AS SOON AS I ENTERED I PERCEIVED THAT
THE SCHOOLROOM WHERE OUR CHILDHOOD HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY THAT GOOD OLD
WOMAN WAS CONVERTED INTO A SHOP
I CALLED TO MIND THE SORROW THE
HEAVINESS THE TEARS AND OPPRESSION OF HEART WHICH I EXPERIENCED IN
THAT CONFINEMENT
EVERY STEP PRODUCED SOME PARTICULAR IMPRESSION
A
PILGRIM IN THE HOLY LAND DOES NOT MEET SO MANY SPOTS PREGNANT WITH
TENDER RECOLLECTIONS AND HIS SOUL IS HARDLY MOVED WITH GREATER
DEVOTION
ONE INCIDENT WILL SERVE FOR ILLUSTRATION
I FOLLOWED THE
COURSE OF A STREAM TO A FARM FORMERLY A DELIGHTFUL WALK OF MINE AND
PAUSED AT THE SPOT WHERE WHEN BOYS WE USED TO AMUSE OURSELVES MAKING
DUCKS AND DRAKES UPON THE WATER
I RECOLLECTED SO WELL HOW I USED
FORMERLY TO WATCH THE COURSE OF THAT SAME STREAM FOLLOWING IT WITH
INQUIRING EAGERNESS FORMING ROMANTIC IDEAS OF THE COUNTRIES IT WAS TO
PASS THROUGH BUT MY IMAGINATION WAS SOON EXHAUSTED WHILE THE
WATER CONTINUED FLOWING FARTHER AND FARTHER ON TILL MY FANCY BECAME
BEWILDERED BY THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN INVISIBLE DISTANCE
EXACTLY SUCH
MY DEAR FRIEND SO HAPPY AND SO CONFINED WERE THE THOUGHTS OF OUR GOOD
ANCESTORS
THEIR FEELINGS AND THEIR POETRY WERE FRESH AS CHILDHOOD
AND WHEN ULYSSES TALKS OF THE IMMEASURABLE SEA AND BOUNDLESS EARTH
HIS EPITHETS ARE TRUE NATURAL DEEPLY FELT AND MYSTERIOUS
OF WHAT
IMPORTANCE IS IT THAT I HAVE LEARNED WITH EVERY SCHOOLBOY THAT THE
WORLD IS ROUND MAN NEEDS BUT LITTLE EARTH FOR ENJOYMENT AND STILL LESS
FOR HIS FINAL REPOSE
I AM AT PRESENT WITH THE PRINCE AT HIS HUNTING LODGE
HE IS A MAN WITH
WHOM ONE CAN LIVE HAPPILY
HE IS HONEST AND UNAFFECTED
THERE ARE
HOWEVER SOME STRANGE CHARACTERS ABOUT HIM WHOM I CANNOT AT ALL
UNDERSTAND
THEY DO NOT SEEM VICIOUS AND YET THEY DO NOT CARRY THE
APPEARANCE OF THOROUGHLY HONEST MEN
SOMETIMES I AM DISPOSED TO BELIEVE
THEM HONEST AND YET I CANNOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO CONFIDE IN THEM
IT
GRIEVES ME TO HEAR THE PRINCE OCCASIONALLY TALK OF THINGS WHICH HE HAS
ONLY READ OR HEARD OF AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME VIEW IN WHICH THEY HAVE
BEEN REPRESENTED BY OTHERS
HE VALUES MY UNDERSTANDING AND TALENTS MORE HIGHLY THAN MY HEART BUT I
AM PROUD OF THE LATTER ONLY
IT IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF EVERYTHING OF OUR
STRENGTH HAPPINESS AND MISERY
ALL THE KNOWLEDGE I POSSESS EVERY ONE
ELSE CAN ACQUIRE BUT MY HEART IS EXCLUSIVELY MY OWN
MAY 25
I HAVE HAD A PLAN IN MY HEAD OF WHICH I DID NOT INTEND TO SPEAK TO YOU
UNTIL IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED NOW THAT IT HAS FAILED I MAY AS WELL MENTION
IT
I WISHED TO ENTER THE ARMY AND HAD LONG BEEN DESIROUS OF TAKING
THE STEP
THIS INDEED WAS THE CHIEF REASON FOR MY COMING HERE WITH THE
PRINCE AS HE IS A GENERAL IN THE SERVICE
I COMMUNICATED MY DESIGN TO
HIM DURING ONE OF OUR WALKS TOGETHER
HE DISAPPROVED OF IT AND IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN ACTUAL MADNESS NOT TO HAVE LISTENED TO HIS REASONS
JUNE 11
SAY WHAT YOU WILL I CAN REMAIN HERE NO LONGER
WHY SHOULD I REMAIN
TIME HANGS HEAVY UPON MY HANDS
THE PRINCE IS AS GRACIOUS TO ME AS ANY
ONE COULD BE AND YET I AM NOT AT MY EASE
THERE IS INDEED NOTHING
IN COMMON BETWEEN US
HE IS A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING BUT QUITE OF THE
ORDINARY KIND
HIS CONVERSATION AFFORDS ME NO MORE AMUSEMENT THAN I
SHOULD DERIVE FROM THE PERUSAL OF A WELL WRITTEN BOOK
I SHALL REMAIN
HERE A WEEK LONGER AND THEN START AGAIN ON MY TRAVELS
MY DRAWINGS ARE
THE BEST THINGS I HAVE DONE SINCE I CAME HERE
THE PRINCE HAS A TASTE
FOR THE ARTS AND WOULD IMPROVE IF HIS MIND WERE NOT FETTERED BY COLD
RULES AND MERE TECHNICAL IDEAS
I OFTEN LOSE PATIENCE WHEN WITH
A GLOWING IMAGINATION I AM GIVING EXPRESSION TO ART AND NATURE HE
INTERFERES WITH LEARNED SUGGESTIONS AND USES AT RANDOM THE TECHNICAL
PHRASEOLOGY OF ARTISTS
JULY 16
ONCE MORE I AM A WANDERER A PILGRIM THROUGH THE WORLD
BUT WHAT ELSE
ARE YOU
JULY 18
WHITHER AM I GOING I WILL TELL YOU IN CONFIDENCE
I AM OBLIGED TO
CONTINUE A FORTNIGHT LONGER HERE AND THEN I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER
FOR ME TO VISIT THE MINES IN
BUT I AM ONLY DELUDING MYSELF THUS
THE
FACT IS I WISH TO BE NEAR CHARLOTTE AGAIN THAT IS ALL
I SMILE AT THE
SUGGESTIONS OF MY HEART AND OBEY ITS DICTATES
JULY 29
NO NO IT IS YET WELL ALL IS WELL I HER HUSBAND O GOD WHO GAVE ME
BEING IF THOU HADST DESTINED THIS HAPPINESS FOR ME MY WHOLE LIFE WOULD
HAVE BEEN ONE CONTINUAL THANKSGIVING BUT I WILL NOT MURMUR FORGIVE
THESE TEARS FORGIVE THESE FRUITLESS WISHES
SHE MY WIFE OH THE VERY
THOUGHT OF FOLDING THAT DEAREST OF HEAVEN'S CREATURES IN MY ARMS DEAR
WILHELM MY WHOLE FRAME FEELS CONVULSED WHEN I SEE ALBERT PUT HIS ARMS
AROUND HER SLENDER WAIST
AND SHALL I AVOW IT WHY SHOULD I NOT WILHELM SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN
HAPPIER WITH ME THAN WITH HIM
ALBERT IS NOT THE MAN TO SATISFY THE
WISHES OF SUCH A HEART
HE WANTS A CERTAIN SENSIBILITY HE WANTS IN
SHORT THEIR HEARTS DO NOT BEAT IN UNISON
HOW OFTEN MY DEAR FRIEND
I'M READING A PASSAGE FROM SOME INTERESTING BOOK WHEN MY HEART AND
CHARLOTTE'S SEEMED TO MEET AND IN A HUNDRED OTHER INSTANCES WHEN OUR
SENTIMENTS WERE UNFOLDED BY THE STORY OF SOME FICTITIOUS CHARACTER HAVE
I FELT THAT WE WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER BUT DEAR WILHELM HE LOVES HER
WITH HIS WHOLE SOUL AND WHAT DOES NOT SUCH A LOVE DESERVE
I HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED BY AN INSUFFERABLE VISIT
I HAVE DRIED MY TEARS
AND COMPOSED MY THOUGHTS
ADIEU MY BEST FRIEND
AUGUST 4
I AM NOT ALONE UNFORTUNATE
ALL MEN ARE DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR HOPES AND
DECEIVED IN THEIR EXPECTATIONS
I HAVE PAID A VISIT TO MY GOOD OLD WOMAN
UNDER THE LIME TREES
THE ELDEST BOY RAN OUT TO MEET ME HIS EXCLAMATION
OF JOY BROUGHT OUT HIS MOTHER BUT SHE HAD A VERY MELANCHOLY LOOK
HER
FIRST WORD WAS ALAS DEAR SIR MY LITTLE JOHN IS DEAD HE WAS THE
YOUNGEST OF HER CHILDREN
I WAS SILENT
AND MY HUSBAND HAS RETURNED
FROM SWITZERLAND WITHOUT ANY MONEY AND IF SOME KIND PEOPLE HAD NOT
ASSISTED HIM HE MUST HAVE BEGGED HIS WAY HOME
HE WAS TAKEN ILL WITH
FEVER ON HIS JOURNEY I COULD ANSWER NOTHING BUT MADE THE LITTLE ONE
A PRESENT
SHE INVITED ME TO TAKE SOME FRUIT I COMPLIED AND LEFT THE
PLACE WITH A SORROWFUL HEART
AUGUST 21
MY SENSATIONS ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING
SOMETIMES A HAPPY PROSPECT OPENS
BEFORE ME BUT ALAS IT IS ONLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WHEN I AM
LOST IN REVERIE I CANNOT HELP SAYING TO MYSELF IF ALBERT WERE
TO DIE YES SHE WOULD BECOME AND I SHOULD BE AND SO I PURSUE A
CHIMERA TILL IT LEADS ME TO THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE AT WHICH I SHUDDER
WHEN I PASS THROUGH THE SAME GATE AND WALK ALONG THE SAME ROAD WHICH
FIRST CONDUCTED ME TO CHARLOTTE MY HEART SINKS WITHIN ME AT THE CHANGE
THAT HAS SINCE TAKEN PLACE
ALL ALL IS ALTERED NO SENTIMENT NO
PULSATION OF MY HEART IS THE SAME
MY SENSATIONS ARE SUCH AS WOULD
OCCUR TO SOME DEPARTED PRINCE WHOSE SPIRIT SHOULD RETURN TO VISIT THE
SUPERB PALACE WHICH HE HAD BUILT IN HAPPY TIMES ADORNED WITH COSTLY
MAGNIFICENCE AND LEFT TO A BELOVED SON BUT WHOSE GLORY HE SHOULD FIND
DEPARTED AND ITS HALLS DESERTED AND IN RUINS
SEPTEMBER 3
I SOMETIMES CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW SHE CAN LOVE ANOTHER HOW SHE DARES
LOVE ANOTHER WHEN I LOVE NOTHING IN THIS WORLD SO COMPLETELY SO
DEVOTEDLY AS I LOVE HER WHEN I KNOW ONLY HER AND HAVE NO OTHER
POSSESSION
SEPTEMBER 4
IT IS EVEN SO AS NATURE PUTS ON HER AUTUMN TINTS IT BECOMES AUTUMN WITH
ME AND AROUND ME
MY LEAVES ARE SERE AND YELLOW AND THE NEIGHBOURING
TREES ARE DIVESTED OF THEIR FOLIAGE
DO YOU REMEMBER MY WRITING TO YOU
ABOUT A PEASANT BOY SHORTLY AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE I HAVE JUST MADE
INQUIRIES ABOUT HIM IN WALHEIM
THEY SAY HE HAS BEEN DISMISSED FROM HIS
SERVICE AND IS NOW AVOIDED BY EVERY ONE
I MET HIM YESTERDAY ON THE
ROAD GOING TO A NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE
I SPOKE TO HIM AND HE TOLD ME
HIS STORY
IT INTERESTED ME EXCEEDINGLY AS YOU WILL EASILY UNDERSTAND
WHEN I REPEAT IT TO YOU
BUT WHY SHOULD I TROUBLE YOU WHY SHOULD I
NOT RESERVE ALL MY SORROW FOR MYSELF WHY SHOULD I CONTINUE TO GIVE YOU
OCCASION TO PITY AND BLAME ME BUT NO MATTER THIS ALSO IS PART OF MY
DESTINY
AT FIRST THE PEASANT LAD ANSWERED MY INQUIRIES WITH A SORT OF SUBDUED
MELANCHOLY WHICH SEEMED TO ME THE MARK OF A TIMID DISPOSITION BUT AS
WE GREW TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER HE SPOKE WITH LESS RESERVE AND OPENLY
CONFESSED HIS FAULTS AND LAMENTED HIS MISFORTUNE
I WISH MY DEAR
FRIEND I COULD GIVE PROPER EXPRESSION TO HIS LANGUAGE
HE TOLD ME
WITH A SORT OF PLEASURABLE RECOLLECTION THAT AFTER MY DEPARTURE HIS
PASSION FOR HIS MISTRESS INCREASED DAILY UNTIL AT LAST HE NEITHER KNEW
WHAT HE DID NOR WHAT HE SAID NOR WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HIM
HE COULD
NEITHER EAT NOR DRINK NOR SLEEP HE FELT A SENSE OF SUFFOCATION HE
DISOBEYED ALL ORDERS AND FORGOT ALL COMMANDS INVOLUNTARILY HE SEEMED
AS IF PURSUED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT TILL ONE DAY KNOWING THAT HIS MISTRESS
HAD GONE TO AN UPPER CHAMBER HE HAD FOLLOWED OR RATHER BEEN DRAWN
AFTER HER
AS SHE PROVED DEAF TO HIS ENTREATIES HE HAD RECOURSE TO
VIOLENCE
HE KNOWS NOT WHAT HAPPENED BUT HE CALLED GOD TO WITNESS THAT
HIS INTENTIONS TO HER WERE HONOURABLE AND THAT HE DESIRED NOTHING MORE
SINCERELY THAN THAT THEY SHOULD MARRY AND PASS THEIR LIVES TOGETHER
WHEN HE HAD COME TO THIS POINT HE BEGAN TO HESITATE AS IF THERE
WAS SOMETHING WHICH HE HAD NOT COURAGE TO UTTER TILL AT LENGTH HE
ACKNOWLEDGED WITH SOME CONFUSION CERTAIN LITTLE CONFIDENCES SHE HAD
ENCOURAGED AND LIBERTIES SHE HAD ALLOWED
HE BROKE OFF TWO OR THREE
TIMES IN HIS NARRATION AND ASSURED ME MOST EARNESTLY THAT HE HAD
NO WISH TO MAKE HER BAD AS HE TERMED IT FOR HE LOVED HER STILL AS
SINCERELY AS EVER THAT THE TALE HAD NEVER BEFORE ESCAPED HIS LIPS
AND WAS ONLY NOW TOLD TO CONVINCE ME THAT HE WAS NOT UTTERLY LOST AND
ABANDONED
AND HERE MY DEAR FRIEND I MUST COMMENCE THE OLD SONG WHICH
YOU KNOW I UTTER ETERNALLY
IF I COULD ONLY REPRESENT THE MAN AS HE
STOOD AND STANDS NOW BEFORE ME COULD I ONLY GIVE HIS TRUE EXPRESSIONS
YOU WOULD FEEL COMPELLED TO SYMPATHISE IN HIS FATE
BUT ENOUGH YOU
WHO KNOW MY MISFORTUNE AND MY DISPOSITION CAN EASILY COMPREHEND
THE ATTRACTION WHICH DRAWS ME TOWARD EVERY UNFORTUNATE BEING BUT
PARTICULARLY TOWARD HIM WHOSE STORY I HAVE RECOUNTED
ON PERUSING THIS LETTER A SECOND TIME I FIND I HAVE OMITTED THE
CONCLUSION OF MY TALE BUT IT IS EASILY SUPPLIED
SHE BECAME RESERVED
TOWARD HIM AT THE INSTIGATION OF HER BROTHER WHO HAD LONG HATED HIM
AND DESIRED HIS EXPULSION FROM THE HOUSE FEARING THAT HIS SISTER'S
SECOND MARRIAGE MIGHT DEPRIVE HIS CHILDREN OF THE HANDSOME FORTUNE THEY
EXPECTED FROM HER AS SHE IS CHILDLESS
HE WAS DISMISSED AT LENGTH AND
THE WHOLE AFFAIR OCCASIONED SO MUCH SCANDAL THAT THE MISTRESS DARED NOT
TAKE HIM BACK EVEN IF SHE HAD WISHED IT
SHE HAS SINCE HIRED ANOTHER
SERVANT WITH WHOM THEY SAY HER BROTHER IS EQUALLY DISPLEASED AND
WHOM SHE IS LIKELY TO MARRY BUT MY INFORMANT ASSURES ME THAT HE HIMSELF
IS DETERMINED NOT TO SURVIVE SUCH A CATASTROPHE
THIS STORY IS NEITHER EXAGGERATED NOR EMBELLISHED INDEED I HAVE
WEAKENED AND IMPAIRED IT IN THE NARRATION BY THE NECESSITY OF USING THE
MORE REFINED EXPRESSIONS OF SOCIETY
THIS LOVE THEN THIS CONSTANCY THIS PASSION IS NO POETICAL FICTION
IT IS ACTUAL AND DWELLS IN ITS GREATEST PURITY AMONGST THAT CLASS OF
MANKIND WHOM WE TERM RUDE UNEDUCATED
WE ARE THE EDUCATED NOT THE
PERVERTED
BUT READ THIS STORY WITH ATTENTION I IMPLORE YOU
I AM
TRANQUIL TO DAY FOR I HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED UPON THIS NARRATION YOU SEE
BY MY WRITING THAT I AM NOT SO AGITATED AS USUAL
I READ AND RE READ
THIS TALE WILHELM IT IS THE HISTORY OF YOUR FRIEND MY FORTUNE HAS
BEEN AND WILL BE SIMILAR AND I AM NEITHER HALF SO BRAVE NOR HALF SO
DETERMINED AS THE POOR WRETCH WITH WHOM I HESITATE TO COMPARE MYSELF
SEPTEMBER 5
CHARLOTTE HAD WRITTEN A LETTER TO HER HUSBAND IN THE COUNTRY WHERE HE
WAS DETAINED BY BUSINESS
IT COMMENCED MY DEAREST LOVE RETURN AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE I AWAIT YOU WITH A THOUSAND RAPTURES A FRIEND WHO
ARRIVED BROUGHT WORD THAT FOR CERTAIN REASONS HE COULD NOT RETURN
IMMEDIATELY
CHARLOTTE'S LETTER WAS NOT FORWARDED AND THE SAME EVENING
IT FELL INTO MY HANDS
I READ IT AND SMILED
SHE ASKED THE REASON
WHAT A HEAVENLY TREASURE IS IMAGINATION I EXCLAIMED I FANCIED FOR A
MOMENT THAT THIS WAS WRITTEN TO ME SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED DISPLEASED
I WAS SILENT
SEPTEMBER 6
IT COST ME MUCH TO PART WITH THE BLUE COAT WHICH I WORE THE FIRST TIME I
DANCED WITH CHARLOTTE
BUT I COULD NOT POSSIBLY WEAR IT ANY LONGER
BUT I HAVE ORDERED A NEW ONE PRECISELY SIMILAR EVEN TO THE COLLAR AND
SLEEVES AS WELL AS A NEW WAISTCOAT AND PANTALOONS
BUT IT DOES NOT PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT UPON ME
I KNOW NOT HOW IT IS
BUT I HOPE IN TIME I SHALL LIKE IT BETTER
SEPTEMBER 12
SHE HAS BEEN ABSENT FOR SOME DAYS
SHE WENT TO MEET ALBERT
TO DAY
I VISITED HER SHE ROSE TO RECEIVE ME AND I KISSED HER HAND MOST
TENDERLY
A CANARY AT THE MOMENT FLEW FROM A MIRROR AND SETTLED UPON HER
SHOULDER
HERE IS A NEW FRIEND SHE OBSERVED WHILE SHE MADE HIM PERCH
UPON HER HAND HE IS A PRESENT FOR THE CHILDREN
WHAT A DEAR HE IS
LOOK AT HIM WHEN I FEED HIM HE FLUTTERS WITH HIS WINGS AND PECKS SO
NICELY
HE KISSES ME TOO ONLY LOOK
SHE HELD THE BIRD TO HER MOUTH AND HE PRESSED HER SWEET LIPS WITH
SO MUCH FERVOUR THAT HE SEEMED TO FEEL THE EXCESS OF BLISS WHICH HE
ENJOYED
HE SHALL KISS YOU TOO SHE ADDED AND THEN SHE HELD THE BIRD TOWARD
ME
HIS LITTLE BEAK MOVED FROM HER MOUTH TO MINE AND THE DELIGHTFUL
SENSATION SEEMED LIKE THE FORERUNNER OF THE SWEETEST BLISS
A KISS I OBSERVED DOES NOT SEEM TO SATISFY HIM HE WISHES FOR FOOD
AND SEEMS DISAPPOINTED BY THESE UNSATISFACTORY ENDEARMENTS
BUT HE EATS OUT OF MY MOUTH SHE CONTINUED AND EXTENDED HER LIPS TO
HIM CONTAINING SEED AND SHE SMILED WITH ALL THE CHARM OF A BEING WHO
HAS ALLOWED AN INNOCENT PARTICIPATION OF HER LOVE
I TURNED MY FACE AWAY
SHE SHOULD NOT ACT THUS
SHE OUGHT NOT TO EXCITE
MY IMAGINATION WITH SUCH DISPLAYS OF HEAVENLY INNOCENCE AND HAPPINESS
NOR AWAKEN MY HEART FROM ITS SLUMBERS IN WHICH IT DREAMS OF THE
WORTHLESSNESS OF LIFE AND WHY NOT BECAUSE SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH I LOVE
HER
SEPTEMBER 15
IT MAKES ME WRETCHED WILHELM TO THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE MEN
INCAPABLE OF APPRECIATING THE FEW THINGS WHICH POSSESS A REAL VALUE IN
LIFE
YOU REMEMBER THE WALNUT TREES AT S UNDER WHICH I USED TO SIT
WITH CHARLOTTE DURING MY VISITS TO THE WORTHY OLD VICAR
THOSE GLORIOUS
TREES THE VERY SIGHT OF WHICH HAS SO OFTEN FILLED MY HEART WITH
JOY HOW THEY ADORNED AND REFRESHED THE PARSONAGE YARD WITH THEIR
WIDE EXTENDED BRANCHES AND HOW PLEASING WAS OUR REMEMBRANCE OF THE
GOOD OLD PASTOR BY WHOSE HANDS THEY WERE PLANTED SO MANY YEARS AGO
THE SCHOOLMASTER HAS FREQUENTLY MENTIONED HIS NAME
HE HAD IT FROM HIS
GRANDFATHER
HE MUST HAVE BEEN A MOST EXCELLENT MAN AND UNDER THE
SHADE OF THOSE OLD TREES HIS MEMORY WAS EVER VENERATED BY ME
THE
SCHOOLMASTER INFORMED US YESTERDAY WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES THAT THOSE
TREES HAD BEEN FELLED
YES CUT TO THE GROUND I COULD IN MY WRATH
HAVE SLAIN THE MONSTER WHO STRUCK THE FIRST STROKE
AND I MUST ENDURE
THIS I WHO IF I HAD HAD TWO SUCH TREES IN MY OWN COURT AND ONE HAD
DIED FROM OLD AGE SHOULD HAVE WEPT WITH REAL AFFLICTION
BUT THERE IS
SOME COMFORT LEFT SUCH A THING IS SENTIMENT THE WHOLE VILLAGE MURMURS
AT THE MISFORTUNE AND I HOPE THE VICAR'S WIFE WILL SOON FIND BY THE
CESSATION OF THE VILLAGERS' PRESENTS HOW MUCH SHE HAS WOUNDED THE
FEELINGS OF THE NEIGHBORHHOOD
IT WAS SHE WHO DID IT THE WIFE OF THE
PRESENT INCUMBENT OUR GOOD OLD MAN IS DEAD A TALL SICKLY CREATURE
WHO IS SO FAR RIGHT TO DISREGARD THE WORLD AS THE WORLD TOTALLY
DISREGARDS HER
THE SILLY BEING AFFECTS TO BE LEARNED PRETENDS TO
EXAMINE THE CANONICAL BOOKS LENDS HER AID TOWARD THE NEW FASHIONED
REFORMATION OF CHRISTENDOM MORAL AND CRITICAL AND SHRUGS UP HER
SHOULDERS AT THE MENTION OF LAVATER'S ENTHUSIASM
HER HEALTH IS
DESTROYED ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH SHE IS PREVENTED FROM HAVING ANY
ENJOYMENT HERE BELOW
ONLY SUCH A CREATURE COULD HAVE CUT DOWN MY WALNUT
TREES I CAN NEVER PARDON IT
HEAR HER REASONS
THE FALLING LEAVES MADE
THE COURT WET AND DIRTY THE BRANCHES OBSTRUCTED THE LIGHT BOYS THREW
STONES AT THE NUTS WHEN THEY WERE RIPE AND THE NOISE AFFECTED HER
NERVES AND DISTURBED HER PROFOUND MEDITATIONS WHEN SHE WAS WEIGHING
THE DIFFICULTIES OF KENNICOT SEMLER AND MICHAELIS
FINDING THAT ALL
THE PARISH PARTICULARLY THE OLD PEOPLE WERE DISPLEASED I ASKED WHY
THEY ALLOWED IT AH SIR THEY REPLIED WHEN THE STEWARD ORDERS
WHAT CAN WE POOR PEASANTS DO BUT ONE THING HAS HAPPENED WELL
THE
STEWARD AND THE VICAR WHO FOR ONCE THOUGHT TO REAP SOME ADVANTAGE
FROM THE CAPRICES OF HIS WIFE INTENDED TO DIVIDE THE TREES BETWEEN
THEM
THE REVENUE OFFICE BEING INFORMED OF IT REVIVED AN OLD CLAIM TO
THE GROUND WHERE THE TREES HAD STOOD AND SOLD THEM TO THE BEST BIDDER
THERE THEY STILL LIE ON THE GROUND
IF I WERE THE SOVEREIGN I SHOULD
KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM ALL VICAR STEWARD AND REVENUE OFFICE
SOVEREIGN DID I SAY I SHOULD IN THAT CASE CARE LITTLE ABOUT THE
TREES THAT GREW IN THE COUNTRY
OCTOBER 10
ONLY TO GAZE UPON HER DARK EYES IS TO ME A SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND
WHAT GRIEVES ME IS THAT ALBERT DOES NOT SEEM SO HAPPY AS HE HOPED TO
BE AS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IF I AM NO FRIEND TO THESE PAUSES BUT HERE
I CANNOT EXPRESS IT OTHERWISE AND PROBABLY I AM EXPLICIT ENOUGH
OCTOBER 12
OSSIAN HAS SUPERSEDED HOMER IN MY HEART
TO WHAT A WORLD DOES THE
ILLUSTRIOUS BARD CARRY ME TO WANDER OVER PATHLESS WILDS SURROUNDED BY
IMPETUOUS WHIRLWINDS WHERE BY THE FEEBLE LIGHT OF THE MOON WE SEE THE
SPIRITS OF OUR ANCESTORS TO HEAR FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOPS MID THE ROAR
OF TORRENTS THEIR PLAINTIVE SOUNDS ISSUING FROM DEEP CAVERNS AND THE
SORROWFUL LAMENTATIONS OF A MAIDEN WHO SIGHS AND EXPIRES ON THE MOSSY
TOMB OF THE WARRIOR BY WHOM SHE WAS ADORED
I MEET THIS BARD WITH SILVER
HAIR HE WANDERS IN THE VALLEY HE SEEKS THE FOOTSTEPS OF HIS FATHERS
AND ALAS HE FINDS ONLY THEIR TOMBS
THEN CONTEMPLATING THE PALE MOON
AS SHE SINKS BENEATH THE WAVES OF THE ROLLING SEA THE MEMORY OF
BYGONE DAYS STRIKES THE MIND OF THE HERO DAYS WHEN APPROACHING DANGER
INVIGORATED THE BRAVE AND THE MOON SHONE UPON HIS BARK LADEN WITH
SPOILS AND RETURNING IN TRIUMPH
WHEN I READ IN HIS COUNTENANCE DEEP
SORROW WHEN I SEE HIS DYING GLORY SINK EXHAUSTED INTO THE GRAVE AS HE
INHALES NEW AND HEART THRILLING DELIGHT FROM HIS APPROACHING UNION WITH
HIS BELOVED AND HE CASTS A LOOK ON THE COLD EARTH AND THE TALL GRASS
WHICH IS SO SOON TO COVER HIM AND THEN EXCLAIMS THE TRAVELLER WILL
COME HE WILL COME WHO HAS SEEN MY BEAUTY AND HE WILL ASK 'WHERE IS
THE BARD WHERE IS THE ILLUSTRIOUS SON OF FINGAL HE WILL WALK OVER MY
TOMB AND WILL SEEK ME IN VAIN THEN O MY FRIEND I COULD INSTANTLY
LIKE A TRUE AND NOBLE KNIGHT DRAW MY SWORD AND DELIVER MY PRINCE FROM
THE LONG AND PAINFUL LANGUOR OF A LIVING DEATH AND DISMISS MY OWN SOUL
TO FOLLOW THE DEMIGOD WHOM MY HAND HAD SET FREE
OCTOBER 19
ALAS THE VOID THE FEARFUL VOID WHICH I FEEL IN MY BOSOM SOMETIMES
I THINK IF I COULD ONLY ONCE BUT ONCE PRESS HER TO MY HEART THIS
DREADFUL VOID WOULD BE FILLED
OCTOBER 26
YES I FEEL CERTAIN WILHELM AND EVERY DAY I BECOME MORE CERTAIN THAT
THE EXISTENCE OF ANY BEING WHATEVER IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE
A
FRIEND OF CHARLOTTE'S CALLED TO SEE HER JUST NOW
I WITHDREW INTO A
NEIGHBOURING APARTMENT AND TOOK UP A BOOK BUT FINDING I COULD NOT
READ I SAT DOWN TO WRITE
I HEARD THEM CONVERSE IN AN UNDERTONE THEY
SPOKE UPON INDIFFERENT TOPICS AND RETAILED THE NEWS OF THE TOWN
ONE
WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED ANOTHER WAS ILL VERY ILL SHE HAD A DRY COUGH
HER FACE WAS GROWING THINNER DAILY AND SHE HAD OCCASIONAL FITS
N IS
VERY UNWELL TOO SAID CHARLOTTE
HIS LIMBS BEGIN TO SWELL ALREADY
ANSWERED THE OTHER AND MY LIVELY IMAGINATION CARRIED ME AT ONCE TO THE
BEDS OF THE INFIRM
THERE I SEE THEM STRUGGLING AGAINST DEATH WITH ALL
THE AGONIES OF PAIN AND HORROR AND THESE WOMEN WILHELM TALK OF ALL
THIS WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS ONE WOULD MENTION THE DEATH OF A
STRANGER
AND WHEN I LOOK AROUND THE APARTMENT WHERE I NOW AM WHEN I
SEE CHARLOTTE'S APPAREL LYING BEFORE ME AND ALBERT'S WRITINGS AND ALL
THOSE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE WHICH ARE SO FAMILIAR TO ME EVEN TO
THE VERY INKSTAND WHICH I AM USING WHEN I THINK WHAT I AM TO THIS
FAMILY EVERYTHING
MY FRIENDS ESTEEM ME I OFTEN CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR
HAPPINESS AND MY HEART SEEMS AS IF IT COULD NOT BEAT WITHOUT THEM AND
YET IF I WERE TO DIE IF I WERE TO BE SUMMONED FROM THE MIDST OF THIS
CIRCLE WOULD THEY FEEL OR HOW LONG WOULD THEY FEEL THE VOID WHICH MY
LOSS WOULD MAKE IN THEIR EXISTENCE HOW LONG YES SUCH IS THE FRAILTY
OF MAN THAT EVEN THERE WHERE HE HAS THE GREATEST CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS
OWN BEING WHERE HE MAKES THE STRONGEST AND MOST FORCIBLE IMPRESSION
EVEN IN THE MEMORY IN THE HEART OF HIS BELOVED THERE ALSO HE MUST
PERISH VANISH AND THAT QUICKLY
OCTOBER 27
I COULD TEAR OPEN MY BOSOM WITH VEXATION TO THINK HOW LITTLE WE
ARE CAPABLE OF INFLUENCING THE FEELINGS OF EACH OTHER
NO ONE CAN
COMMUNICATE TO ME THOSE SENSATIONS OF LOVE JOY RAPTURE AND DELIGHT
WHICH I DO NOT NATURALLY POSSESS AND THOUGH MY HEART MAY GLOW WITH THE
MOST LIVELY AFFECTION I CANNOT MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF ONE IN WHOM THE
SAME WARMTH IS NOT INHERENT
OCTOBER 27 EVENING
I POSSESS SO MUCH BUT MY LOVE FOR HER ABSORBS IT ALL
I POSSESS SO
MUCH BUT WITHOUT HER I HAVE NOTHING
OCTOBER 30
ONE HUNDRED TIMES HAVE I BEEN ON THE POINT OF EMBRACING HER
HEAVENS
WHAT A TORMENT IT IS TO SEE SO MUCH LOVELINESS PASSING AND REPASSING
BEFORE US AND YET NOT DARE TO LAY HOLD OF IT AND LAYING HOLD IS THE
MOST NATURAL OF HUMAN INSTINCTS
DO NOT CHILDREN TOUCH EVERYTHING THEY
SEE AND I
NOVEMBER 3
WITNESS HEAVEN HOW OFTEN I LIE DOWN IN MY BED WITH A WISH AND EVEN A
HOPE THAT I MAY NEVER AWAKEN AGAIN
AND IN THE MORNING WHEN I OPEN MY
EYES I BEHOLD THE SUN ONCE MORE AND AM WRETCHED
IF I WERE WHIMSICAL
I MIGHT BLAME THE WEATHER OR AN ACQUAINTANCE OR SOME PERSONAL
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR MY DISCONTENTED MIND AND THEN THIS INSUPPORTABLE
LOAD OF TROUBLE WOULD NOT REST ENTIRELY UPON MYSELF
BUT ALAS I FEEL
IT TOO SADLY
I AM ALONE THE CAUSE OF MY OWN WOE AM I NOT TRULY
MY OWN BOSOM CONTAINS THE SOURCE OF ALL MY SORROW AS IT PREVIOUSLY
CONTAINED THE SOURCE OF ALL MY PLEASURE
AM I NOT THE SAME BEING WHO
ONCE ENJOYED AN EXCESS OF HAPPINESS WHO AT EVERY STEP SAW PARADISE
OPEN BEFORE HIM AND WHOSE HEART WAS EVER EXPANDED TOWARD THE WHOLE
WORLD AND THIS HEART IS NOW DEAD NO SENTIMENT CAN REVIVE IT MY EYES
ARE DRY AND MY SENSES NO MORE REFRESHED BY THE INFLUENCE OF SOFT
TEARS WITHER AND CONSUME MY BRAIN
I SUFFER MUCH FOR I HAVE LOST
THE ONLY CHARM OF LIFE THAT ACTIVE SACRED POWER WHICH CREATED WORLDS
AROUND ME IT IS NO MORE
WHEN I LOOK FROM MY WINDOW AT THE DISTANT
HILLS AND BEHOLD THE MORNING SUN BREAKING THROUGH THE MISTS AND
ILLUMINATING THE COUNTRY AROUND WHICH IS STILL WRAPPED IN SILENCE
WHILST THE SOFT STREAM WINDS GENTLY THROUGH THE WILLOWS WHICH HAVE SHED
THEIR LEAVES WHEN GLORIOUS NATURE DISPLAYS ALL HER BEAUTIES BEFORE ME
AND HER WONDROUS PROSPECTS ARE INEFFECTUAL TO EXTRACT ONE TEAR OF JOY
FROM MY WITHERED HEART I FEEL THAT IN SUCH A MOMENT I STAND LIKE A
REPROBATE BEFORE HEAVEN HARDENED INSENSIBLE AND UNMOVED
OFTENTIMES
DO I THEN BEND MY KNEE TO THE EARTH AND IMPLORE GOD FOR THE BLESSING
OF TEARS AS THE DESPONDING LABOURER IN SOME SCORCHING CLIMATE PRAYS FOR
THE DEWS OF HEAVEN TO MOISTEN HIS PARCHED CORN
BUT I FEEL THAT GOD DOES NOT GRANT SUNSHINE OR RAIN TO OUR IMPORTUNATE
ENTREATIES
AND OH THOSE BYGONE DAYS WHOSE MEMORY NOW TORMENTS ME
WHY WERE THEY SO FORTUNATE BECAUSE I THEN WAITED WITH PATIENCE FOR
THE BLESSINGS OF THE ETERNAL AND RECEIVED HIS GIFTS WITH THE GRATEFUL
FEELINGS OF A THANKFUL HEART
NOVEMBER 8
CHARLOTTE HAS REPROVED ME FOR MY EXCESSES WITH SO MUCH TENDERNESS AND
GOODNESS I HAVE LATELY BEEN IN THE HABIT OF DRINKING MORE WINE THAN
HERETOFORE
DON'T DO IT SHE SAID
THINK OF CHARLOTTE THINK OF
YOU I ANSWERED NEED YOU BID ME DO SO THINK OF YOU I DO NOT THINK
OF YOU YOU ARE EVER BEFORE MY SOUL THIS VERY MORNING I SAT ON THE
SPOT WHERE A FEW DAYS AGO YOU DESCENDED FROM THE CARRIAGE AND SHE
IMMEDIATELY CHANGED THE SUBJECT TO PREVENT ME FROM PURSUING IT FARTHER
MY DEAR FRIEND MY ENERGIES ARE ALL PROSTRATED SHE CAN DO WITH ME WHAT
SHE PLEASES
NOVEMBER 15
I THANK YOU WILHELM FOR YOUR CORDIAL SYMPATHY FOR YOUR EXCELLENT
ADVICE AND I IMPLORE YOU TO BE QUIET
LEAVE ME TO MY SUFFERINGS
IN
SPITE OF MY WRETCHEDNESS I HAVE STILL STRENGTH ENOUGH FOR ENDURANCE
I REVERE RELIGION YOU KNOW I DO
I FEEL THAT IT CAN IMPART STRENGTH
TO THE FEEBLE AND COMFORT TO THE AFFLICTED BUT DOES IT AFFECT ALL MEN
EQUALLY CONSIDER THIS VAST UNIVERSE YOU WILL SEE THOUSANDS FOR WHOM IT
HAS NEVER EXISTED THOUSANDS FOR WHOM IT WILL NEVER EXIST WHETHER IT BE
PREACHED TO THEM OR NOT AND MUST IT THEN NECESSARILY EXIST FOR ME
DOES NOT THE SON OF GOD HIMSELF SAY THAT THEY ARE HIS WHOM THE FATHER
HAS GIVEN TO HIM HAVE I BEEN GIVEN TO HIM WHAT IF THE FATHER WILL
RETAIN ME FOR HIMSELF AS MY HEART SOMETIMES SUGGESTS I PRAY YOU DO
NOT MISINTERPRET THIS
DO NOT EXTRACT DERISION FROM MY HARMLESS WORDS
I
POUR OUT MY WHOLE SOUL BEFORE YOU
SILENCE WERE OTHERWISE PREFERABLE TO
ME BUT I NEED NOT SHRINK FROM A SUBJECT OF WHICH FEW KNOW MORE THAN I
DO MYSELF
WHAT IS THE DESTINY OF MAN BUT TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF
HIS SUFFERINGS AND TO DRINK HIS ALLOTTED CUP OF BITTERNESS AND IF THAT
SAME CUP PROVED BITTER TO THE GOD OF HEAVEN UNDER A HUMAN FORM WHY
SHOULD I AFFECT A FOOLISH PRIDE AND CALL IT SWEET WHY SHOULD I BE
ASHAMED OF SHRINKING AT THAT FEARFUL MOMENT WHEN MY WHOLE BEING WILL
TREMBLE BETWEEN EXISTENCE AND ANNIHILATION WHEN A REMEMBRANCE OF
THE PAST LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING WILL ILLUMINATE THE DARK GULF OF
FUTURITY WHEN EVERYTHING SHALL DISSOLVE AROUND ME AND THE WHOLE WORLD
VANISH AWAY IS NOT THIS THE VOICE OF A CREATURE OPPRESSED BEYOND ALL
RESOURCE SELF DEFICIENT ABOUT TO PLUNGE INTO INEVITABLE DESTRUCTION
AND GROANING DEEPLY AT ITS INADEQUATE STRENGTH MY GOD MY GOD WHY
HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME AND SHOULD I FEEL ASHAMED TO UTTER THE SAME
EXPRESSION SHOULD I NOT SHUDDER AT A PROSPECT WHICH HAD ITS FEARS EVEN
FOR HIM WHO FOLDS UP THE HEAVENS LIKE A GARMENT
NOVEMBER 21
SHE DOES NOT FEEL SHE DOES NOT KNOW THAT SHE IS PREPARING A POISON
WHICH WILL DESTROY US BOTH AND I DRINK DEEPLY OF THE DRAUGHT WHICH IS
TO PROVE MY DESTRUCTION
WHAT MEAN THOSE LOOKS OF KINDNESS WITH WHICH
SHE OFTEN OFTEN NO NOT OFTEN BUT SOMETIMES REGARDS ME THAT
COMPLACENCY WITH WHICH SHE HEARS THE INVOLUNTARY SENTIMENTS WHICH
FREQUENTLY ESCAPE ME AND THE TENDER PITY FOR MY SUFFERINGS WHICH
APPEARS IN HER COUNTENANCE
YESTERDAY WHEN I TOOK LEAVE SHE SEIZED ME BY THE HAND AND SAID
ADIEU DEAR WERTHER DEAR WERTHER IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE EVER
CALLED ME DEAR THE SOUND SUNK DEEP INTO MY HEART
I HAVE REPEATED IT A
HUNDRED TIMES AND LAST NIGHT ON GOING TO BED AND TALKING TO MYSELF
OF VARIOUS THINGS I SUDDENLY SAID GOOD NIGHT DEAR WERTHER AND THEN
COULD NOT BUT LAUGH AT MYSELF
NOVEMBER 22
I CANNOT PRAY LEAVE HER TO ME AND YET SHE OFTEN SEEMS TO BELONG TO
ME
I CANNOT PRAY GIVE HER TO ME FOR SHE IS ANOTHER'S
IN THIS WAY
I AFFECT MIRTH OVER MY TROUBLES AND IF I HAD TIME I COULD COMPOSE A
WHOLE LITANY OF ANTITHESES
NOVEMBER 24
SHE IS SENSIBLE OF MY SUFFERINGS
THIS MORNING HER LOOK PIERCED MY VERY
SOUL
I FOUND HER ALONE AND SHE WAS SILENT SHE STEADFASTLY SURVEYED
ME
I NO LONGER SAW IN HER FACE THE CHARMS OF BEAUTY OR THE FIRE OF
GENIUS THESE HAD DISAPPEARED
BUT I WAS AFFECTED BY AN EXPRESSION MUCH
MORE TOUCHING A LOOK OF THE DEEPEST SYMPATHY AND OF THE SOFTEST PITY
WHY WAS I AFRAID TO THROW MYSELF AT HER FEET WHY DID I NOT DARE TO TAKE
HER IN MY ARMS AND ANSWER HER BY A THOUSAND KISSES SHE HAD RECOURSE TO
HER PIANO FOR RELIEF AND IN A LOW AND SWEET VOICE ACCOMPANIED THE MUSIC
WITH DELICIOUS SOUNDS
HER LIPS NEVER APPEARED SO LOVELY THEY SEEMED
BUT JUST TO OPEN THAT THEY MIGHT IMBIBE THE SWEET TONES WHICH ISSUED
FROM THE INSTRUMENT AND RETURN THE HEAVENLY VIBRATION FROM HER LOVELY
MOUTH
OH WHO CAN EXPRESS MY SENSATIONS I WAS QUITE OVERCOME AND
BENDING DOWN PRONOUNCED THIS VOW BEAUTIFUL LIPS WHICH THE ANGELS
GUARD NEVER WILL I SEEK TO PROFANE YOUR PURITY WITH A KISS AND
YET MY FRIEND OH I WISH BUT MY HEART IS DARKENED BY DOUBT AND
INDECISION COULD I BUT TASTE FELICITY AND THEN DIE TO EXPIATE THE SIN
WHAT SIN
NOVEMBER 26
OFTENTIMES I SAY TO MYSELF THOU ALONE ART WRETCHED ALL OTHER MORTALS
ARE HAPPY NONE ARE DISTRESSED LIKE THEE THEN I READ A PASSAGE IN AN
ANCIENT POET AND I SEEM TO UNDERSTAND MY OWN HEART
I HAVE SO MUCH TO
ENDURE HAVE MEN BEFORE ME EVER BEEN SO WRETCHED
NOVEMBER 30
I SHALL NEVER BE MYSELF AGAIN WHEREVER I GO SOME FATALITY OCCURS TO
DISTRACT ME
EVEN TO DAY ALAS FOR OUR DESTINY ALAS FOR HUMAN NATURE
ABOUT DINNER TIME I WENT TO WALK BY THE RIVER SIDE FOR I HAD NO
APPETITE
EVERYTHING AROUND SEEMED GLOOMY A COLD AND DAMP EASTERLY WIND
BLEW FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND BLACK HEAVY CLOUDS SPREAD OVER THE PLAIN
I OBSERVED AT A DISTANCE A MAN IN A TATTERED COAT HE WAS WANDERING
AMONG THE ROCKS AND SEEMED TO BE LOOKING FOR PLANTS
WHEN I APPROACHED
HE TURNED ROUND AT THE NOISE AND I SAW THAT HE HAD AN INTERESTING
COUNTENANCE IN WHICH A SETTLED MELANCHOLY STRONGLY MARKED BY
BENEVOLENCE FORMED THE PRINCIPAL FEATURE
HIS LONG BLACK HAIR WAS
DIVIDED AND FLOWED OVER HIS SHOULDERS
AS HIS GARB BETOKENED A PERSON
OF THE LOWER ORDER I THOUGHT HE WOULD NOT TAKE IT ILL IF I INQUIRED
ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND I THEREFORE ASKED WHAT HE WAS SEEKING
HE
REPLIED WITH A DEEP SIGH THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR FLOWERS AND COULD
FIND NONE
BUT IT IS NOT THE SEASON I OBSERVED WITH A SMILE
OH
THERE ARE SO MANY FLOWERS HE ANSWERED AS HE CAME NEARER TO ME
IN MY
GARDEN THERE ARE ROSES AND HONEYSUCKLES OF TWO SORTS ONE SORT WAS
GIVEN TO ME BY MY FATHER THEY GROW AS PLENTIFULLY AS WEEDS I HAVE BEEN
LOOKING FOR THEM THESE TWO DAYS AND CANNOT FIND THEM
THERE ARE FLOWERS
OUT THERE YELLOW BLUE AND RED AND THAT CENTAURY HAS A VERY PRETTY
BLOSSOM BUT I CAN FIND NONE OF THEM I OBSERVED HIS PECULIARITY AND
THEREFORE ASKED HIM WITH AN AIR OF INDIFFERENCE WHAT HE INTENDED TO
DO WITH HIS FLOWERS
A STRANGE SMILE OVERSPREAD HIS COUNTENANCE
HOLDING
HIS FINGER TO HIS MOUTH HE EXPRESSED A HOPE THAT I WOULD NOT BETRAY
HIM AND HE THEN INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD PROMISED TO GATHER A NOSEGAY
FOR HIS MISTRESS
THAT IS RIGHT SAID I
OH HE REPLIED SHE
POSSESSES MANY OTHER THINGS AS WELL SHE IS VERY RICH AND YET I
CONTINUED SHE LIKES YOUR NOSEGAYS OH SHE HAS JEWELS AND CROWNS
HE EXCLAIMED
I ASKED WHO SHE WAS
IF THE STATES GENERAL WOULD BUT PAY
ME HE ADDED I SHOULD BE QUITE ANOTHER MAN
ALAS THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN I WAS SO HAPPY BUT THAT IS PAST AND I AM NOW HE RAISED HIS
SWIMMING EYES TO HEAVEN
AND YOU WERE HAPPY ONCE I OBSERVED
AH
WOULD I WERE SO STILL WAS HIS REPLY
I WAS THEN AS GAY AND CONTENTED
AS A MAN CAN BE AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS COMING TOWARD US NOW CALLED
OUT HENRY HENRY WHERE ARE YOU WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
EVERYWHERE COME TO DINNER IS HE YOUR SON I INQUIRED AS I WENT
TOWARD HER
YES SHE SAID HE IS MY POOR UNFORTUNATE SON
THE LORD
HAS SENT ME A HEAVY AFFLICTION I ASKED WHETHER HE HAD BEEN LONG IN
THIS STATE
SHE ANSWERED HE HAS BEEN AS CALM AS HE IS AT PRESENT FOR
ABOUT SIX MONTHS
I THANK HEAVEN THAT HE HAS SO FAR RECOVERED HE WAS
FOR ONE WHOLE YEAR QUITE RAVING AND CHAINED DOWN IN A MADHOUSE
NOW HE
INJURES NO ONE BUT TALKS OF NOTHING ELSE THAN KINGS AND QUEENS
HE USED
TO BE A VERY GOOD QUIET YOUTH AND HELPED TO MAINTAIN ME HE WROTE A
VERY FINE HAND BUT ALL AT ONCE HE BECAME MELANCHOLY WAS SEIZED WITH A
VIOLENT FEVER GREW DISTRACTED AND IS NOW AS YOU SEE
IF I WERE ONLY TO
TELL YOU SIR I INTERRUPTED HER BY ASKING WHAT PERIOD IT WAS IN WHICH
HE BOASTED OF HAVING BEEN SO HAPPY
POOR BOY SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A
SMILE OF COMPASSION HE MEANS THE TIME WHEN HE WAS COMPLETELY DERANGED
A TIME HE NEVER CEASES TO REGRET WHEN HE WAS IN THE MADHOUSE AND
UNCONSCIOUS OF EVERYTHING I WAS THUNDERSTRUCK I PLACED A PIECE OF
MONEY IN HER HAND AND HASTENED AWAY
YOU WERE HAPPY I EXCLAIMED AS I RETURNED QUICKLY TO THE TOWN 'AS
GAY AND CONTENTED AS A MAN CAN BE GOD OF HEAVEN AND IS THIS THE
DESTINY OF MAN IS HE ONLY HAPPY BEFORE HE HAS ACQUIRED HIS REASON OR
AFTER HE HAS LOST IT UNFORTUNATE BEING AND YET I ENVY YOUR FATE I
ENVY THE DELUSION TO WHICH YOU ARE A VICTIM
YOU GO FORTH WITH JOY TO
GATHER FLOWERS FOR YOUR PRINCESS IN WINTER AND GRIEVE WHEN YOU CAN
FIND NONE AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DO NOT GROW
BUT I WANDER
FORTH WITHOUT JOY WITHOUT HOPE WITHOUT DESIGN AND I RETURN AS I CAME
YOU FANCY WHAT A MAN YOU WOULD BE IF THE STATES GENERAL PAID YOU
HAPPY
MORTAL WHO CAN ASCRIBE YOUR WRETCHEDNESS TO AN EARTHLY CAUSE YOU
DO NOT KNOW YOU DO NOT FEEL THAT IN YOUR OWN DISTRACTED HEART AND
DISORDERED BRAIN DWELLS THE SOURCE OF THAT UNHAPPINESS WHICH ALL THE
POTENTATES ON EARTH CANNOT RELIEVE
LET THAT MAN DIE UNCONSOLED WHO CAN DERIDE THE INVALID FOR UNDERTAKING
A JOURNEY TO DISTANT HEALTHFUL SPRINGS WHERE HE OFTEN FINDS ONLY A
HEAVIER DISEASE AND A MORE PAINFUL DEATH OR WHO CAN EXULT OVER THE
DESPAIRING MIND OF A SINNER WHO TO OBTAIN PEACE OF CONSCIENCE AND AN
ALLEVIATION OF MISERY MAKES A PILGRIMAGE TO THE HOLY SEPULCHRE
EACH
LABORIOUS STEP WHICH GALLS HIS WOUNDED FEET IN ROUGH AND UNTRODDEN PATHS
POURS A DROP OF BALM INTO HIS TROUBLED SOUL AND THE JOURNEY OF MANY A
WEARY DAY BRINGS A NIGHTLY RELIEF TO HIS ANGUISHED HEART
WILL YOU DARE
CALL THIS ENTHUSIASM YE CROWD OF POMPOUS DECLAIMERS ENTHUSIASM O GOD
THOU SEEST MY TEARS
THOU HAST ALLOTTED US OUR PORTION OF MISERY MUST
WE ALSO HAVE BRETHREN TO PERSECUTE US TO DEPRIVE US OF OUR CONSOLATION
OF OUR TRUST IN THEE AND IN THY LOVE AND MERCY FOR OUR TRUST IN THE
VIRTUE OF THE HEALING ROOT OR IN THE STRENGTH OF THE VINE WHAT IS IT
ELSE THAN A BELIEF IN THEE FROM WHOM ALL THAT SURROUNDS US DERIVES ITS
HEALING AND RESTORING POWERS FATHER WHOM I KNOW NOT WHO WERT ONCE
WONT TO FILL MY SOUL BUT WHO NOW HIDEST THY FACE FROM ME CALL ME BACK
TO THEE BE SILENT NO LONGER THY SILENCE SHALL NOT DELAY A SOUL WHICH
THIRSTS AFTER THEE
WHAT MAN WHAT FATHER COULD BE ANGRY WITH A SON FOR
RETURNING TO HIM SUDDENLY FOR FALLING ON HIS NECK AND EXCLAIMING I
AM HERE AGAIN MY FATHER FORGIVE ME IF I HAVE ANTICIPATED MY JOURNEY
AND RETURNED BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME THE WORLD IS EVERYWHERE THE
SAME A SCENE OF LABOUR AND PAIN OF PLEASURE AND REWARD BUT WHAT DOES
IT ALL AVAIL I AM HAPPY ONLY WHERE THOU ART AND IN THY PRESENCE AM I
CONTENT TO SUFFER OR ENJOY AND WOULDST THOU HEAVENLY FATHER BANISH
SUCH A CHILD FROM THY PRESENCE
DECEMBER 1
WILHELM THE MAN ABOUT WHOM I WROTE TO YOU THAT MAN SO ENVIABLE IN HIS
MISFORTUNES WAS SECRETARY TO CHARLOTTE'S FATHER AND AN UNHAPPY PASSION
FOR HER WHICH HE CHERISHED CONCEALED AND AT LENGTH DISCOVERED CAUSED
HIM TO BE DISMISSED FROM HIS SITUATION
THIS MADE HIM MAD
THINK WHILST
YOU PERUSE THIS PLAIN NARRATION WHAT AN IMPRESSION THE CIRCUMSTANCE HAS
MADE UPON ME BUT IT WAS RELATED TO ME BY ALBERT WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS
AS YOU WILL PROBABLY PERUSE IT
DECEMBER 4
I IMPLORE YOUR ATTENTION
IT IS ALL OVER WITH ME
I CAN SUPPORT THIS
STATE NO LONGER
TO DAY I WAS SITTING BY CHARLOTTE
SHE WAS PLAYING
UPON HER PIANO A SUCCESSION OF DELIGHTFUL MELODIES WITH SUCH INTENSE
EXPRESSION HER LITTLE SISTER WAS DRESSING HER DOLL UPON MY LAP
THE
TEARS CAME INTO MY EYES
I LEANED DOWN AND LOOKED INTENTLY AT HER
WEDDING RING MY TEARS FELL IMMEDIATELY SHE BEGAN TO PLAY THAT
FAVOURITE THAT DIVINE AIR WHICH HAS SO OFTEN ENCHANTED ME
I FELT
COMFORT FROM A RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST OF THOSE BYGONE DAYS WHEN THAT
AIR WAS FAMILIAR TO ME AND THEN I RECALLED ALL THE SORROWS AND THE
DISAPPOINTMENTS WHICH I HAD SINCE ENDURED
I PACED WITH HASTY STRIDES
THROUGH THE ROOM MY HEART BECAME CONVULSED WITH PAINFUL EMOTIONS
AT
LENGTH I WENT UP TO HER AND EXCLAIMED WITH EAGERNESS FOR HEAVEN'S
SAKE PLAY THAT AIR NO LONGER SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED STEADFASTLY AT
ME
SHE THEN SAID WITH A SMILE WHICH SUNK DEEP INTO MY HEART WERTHER
YOU ARE ILL YOUR DEAREST FOOD IS DISTASTEFUL TO YOU
BUT GO I ENTREAT
YOU AND ENDEAVOUR TO COMPOSE YOURSELF I TORE MYSELF AWAY
GOD THOU
SEEST MY TORMENTS AND WILT END THEM
DECEMBER 6
HOW HER IMAGE HAUNTS ME WAKING OR ASLEEP SHE FILLS MY ENTIRE SOUL
SOON AS I CLOSE MY EYES HERE IN MY BRAIN WHERE ALL THE NERVES OF
VISION ARE CONCENTRATED HER DARK EYES ARE IMPRINTED
HERE I DO NOT
KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT BUT IF I SHUT MY EYES HERS ARE IMMEDIATELY
BEFORE ME DARK AS AN ABYSS THEY OPEN UPON ME AND ABSORB MY SENSES
AND WHAT IS MAN THAT BOASTED DEMIGOD DO NOT HIS POWERS FAIL WHEN HE
MOST REQUIRES THEIR USE AND WHETHER HE SOAR IN JOY OR SINK IN SORROW
IS NOT HIS CAREER IN BOTH INEVITABLY ARRESTED AND WHILST HE FONDLY
DREAMS THAT HE IS GRASPING AT INFINITY DOES HE NOT FEEL COMPELLED TO
RETURN TO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS COLD MONOTONOUS EXISTENCE
THE EDITOR TO THE READER
IT IS A MATTER OF EXTREME REGRET THAT WE WANT ORIGINAL EVIDENCE OF THE
LAST REMARKABLE DAYS OF OUR FRIEND AND WE ARE THEREFORE OBLIGED
TO INTERRUPT THE PROGRESS OF HIS CORRESPONDENCE AND TO SUPPLY THE
DEFICIENCY BY A CONNECTED NARRATION
I HAVE FELT IT MY DUTY TO COLLECT ACCURATE INFORMATION FROM THE MOUTHS
OF PERSONS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS HISTORY
THE STORY IS SIMPLE AND
ALL THE ACCOUNTS AGREE EXCEPT IN SOME UNIMPORTANT PARTICULARS
IT IS
TRUE THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE CHARACTERS OF THE PERSONS SPOKEN OF
OPINIONS AND JUDGMENTS VARY
WE HAVE ONLY THEN TO RELATE CONSCIENTIOUSLY THE FACTS WHICH OUR
DILIGENT LABOUR HAS ENABLED US TO COLLECT TO GIVE THE LETTERS OF THE
DECEASED AND TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE SLIGHTEST FRAGMENT FROM
HIS PEN MORE ESPECIALLY AS IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER THE REAL AND
CORRECT MOTIVES OF MEN WHO ARE NOT OF THE COMMON ORDER
SORROW AND DISCONTENT HAD TAKEN DEEP ROOT IN WERTHER'S SOUL AND
GRADUALLY IMPARTED THEIR CHARACTER TO HIS WHOLE BEING
THE HARMONY OF
HIS MIND BECAME COMPLETELY DISTURBED A PERPETUAL EXCITEMENT AND MENTAL
IRRITATION WHICH WEAKENED HIS NATURAL POWERS PRODUCED THE SADDEST
EFFECTS UPON HIM AND RENDERED HIM AT LENGTH THE VICTIM OF AN EXHAUSTION
AGAINST WHICH HE STRUGGLED WITH STILL MORE PAINFUL EFFORTS THAN HE HAD
DISPLAYED EVEN IN CONTENDING WITH HIS OTHER MISFORTUNES
HIS MENTAL
ANXIETY WEAKENED HIS VARIOUS GOOD QUALITIES AND HE WAS SOON CONVERTED
INTO A GLOOMY COMPANION ALWAYS UNHAPPY AND UNJUST IN HIS IDEAS THE
MORE WRETCHED HE BECAME
THIS WAS AT LEAST THE OPINION OF ALBERT'S
FRIENDS
THEY ASSERT MOREOVER THAT THE CHARACTER OF ALBERT HIMSELF HAD
UNDERGONE NO CHANGE IN THE MEANTIME HE WAS STILL THE SAME BEING WHOM
WERTHER HAD LOVED HONOURED AND RESPECTED FROM THE COMMENCEMENT
HIS
LOVE FOR CHARLOTTE WAS UNBOUNDED HE WAS PROUD OF HER AND DESIRED THAT
SHE SHOULD BE RECOGNISED BY EVERY ONE AS THE NOBLEST OF CREATED BEINGS
WAS HE HOWEVER TO BLAME FOR WISHING TO AVERT FROM HER EVERY APPEARANCE
OF SUSPICION OR FOR HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO SHARE HIS RICH PRIZE WITH
ANOTHER EVEN FOR A MOMENT AND IN THE MOST INNOCENT MANNER IT IS
ASSERTED THAT ALBERT FREQUENTLY RETIRED FROM HIS WIFE'S APARTMENT DURING
WERTHER'S VISITS BUT THIS DID NOT ARISE FROM HATRED OR AVERSION TO
HIS FRIEND BUT ONLY FROM A FEELING THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS OPPRESSIVE TO
WERTHER
CHARLOTTE'S FATHER WHO WAS CONFINED TO THE HOUSE BY INDISPOSITION WAS
ACCUSTOMED TO SEND HIS CARRIAGE FOR HER THAT SHE MIGHT MAKE EXCURSIONS
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
ONE DAY THE WEATHER HAD BEEN UNUSUALLY SEVERE AND
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS COVERED WITH SNOW
WERTHER WENT FOR CHARLOTTE THE FOLLOWING MORNING IN ORDER THAT IF
ALBERT WERE ABSENT HE MIGHT CONDUCT HER HOME
THE BEAUTIFUL WEATHER PRODUCED BUT LITTLE IMPRESSION ON HIS TROUBLED
SPIRIT
A HEAVY WEIGHT LAY UPON HIS SOUL DEEP MELANCHOLY HAD TAKEN
POSSESSION OF HIM AND HIS MIND KNEW NO CHANGE SAVE FROM ONE PAINFUL
THOUGHT TO ANOTHER
AS HE NOW NEVER ENJOYED INTERNAL PEACE THE CONDITION OF HIS FELLOW
CREATURES WAS TO HIM A PERPETUAL SOURCE OF TROUBLE AND DISTRESS
HE
BELIEVED HE HAD DISTURBED THE HAPPINESS OF ALBERT AND HIS WIFE AND
WHILST HE CENSURED HIMSELF STRONGLY FOR THIS HE BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN A
SECRET DISLIKE TO ALBERT
HIS THOUGHTS WERE OCCASIONALLY DIRECTED TO THIS POINT
YES HE WOULD
REPEAT TO HIMSELF WITH ILL CONCEALED DISSATISFACTION YES THIS IS
AFTER ALL THE EXTENT OF THAT CONFIDING DEAR TENDER AND SYMPATHETIC
LOVE THAT CALM AND ETERNAL FIDELITY WHAT DO I BEHOLD BUT SATIETY AND
INDIFFERENCE DOES NOT EVERY FRIVOLOUS ENGAGEMENT ATTRACT HIM MORE THAN
HIS CHARMING AND LOVELY WIFE DOES HE KNOW HOW TO PRIZE HIS HAPPINESS
CAN HE VALUE HER AS SHE DESERVES HE POSSESSES HER IT IS TRUE I KNOW
THAT AS I KNOW MUCH MORE AND I HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE THOUGHT
THAT HE WILL DRIVE ME MAD OR PERHAPS MURDER ME
IS HIS FRIENDSHIP
TOWARD ME UNIMPAIRED DOES HE NOT VIEW MY ATTACHMENT TO CHARLOTTE AS
AN INFRINGEMENT UPON HIS RIGHTS AND CONSIDER MY ATTENTION TO HER AS A
SILENT REBUKE TO HIMSELF I KNOW AND INDEED FEEL THAT HE DISLIKES ME
THAT HE WISHES FOR MY ABSENCE THAT MY PRESENCE IS HATEFUL TO HIM
HE WOULD OFTEN PAUSE WHEN ON HIS WAY TO VISIT CHARLOTTE STAND STILL AS
THOUGH IN DOUBT AND SEEM DESIROUS OF RETURNING BUT WOULD NEVERTHELESS
PROCEED AND ENGAGED IN SUCH THOUGHTS AND SOLILOQUIES AS WE HAVE
DESCRIBED HE FINALLY REACHED THE HUNTING LODGE WITH A SORT OF
INVOLUNTARY CONSENT
UPON ONE OCCASION HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND INQUIRING FOR CHARLOTTE
HE OBSERVED THAT THE INMATES WERE IN A STATE OF UNUSUAL CONFUSION
THE ELDEST BOY INFORMED HIM THAT A DREADFUL MISFORTUNE HAD OCCURRED
AT WALHEIM THAT A PEASANT HAD BEEN MURDERED BUT THIS MADE LITTLE
IMPRESSION UPON HIM
ENTERING THE APARTMENT HE FOUND CHARLOTTE ENGAGED
REASONING WITH HER FATHER WHO IN SPITE OF HIS INFIRMITY INSISTED ON
GOING TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME IN ORDER TO INSTITUTE AN INQUIRY
THE
CRIMINAL WAS UNKNOWN THE VICTIM HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD AT HIS OWN DOOR
THAT MORNING
SUSPICIONS WERE EXCITED THE MURDERED MAN HAD BEEN IN
THE SERVICE OF A WIDOW AND THE PERSON WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY FILLED THE
SITUATION HAD BEEN DISMISSED FROM HER EMPLOYMENT
AS SOON AS WERTHER HEARD THIS HE EXCLAIMED WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT
IS IT POSSIBLE I MUST GO TO THE SPOT I CANNOT DELAY A MOMENT HE
HASTENED TO WALHEIM
EVERY INCIDENT RETURNED VIVIDLY TO HIS REMEMBRANCE
AND HE ENTERTAINED NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT THAT MAN WAS THE
MURDERER TO WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN SPOKEN AND FOR WHOM HE ENTERTAINED
SO MUCH REGARD
HIS WAY TOOK HIM PAST THE WELL KNOWN LIME TREES TO THE
HOUSE WHERE THE BODY HAD BEEN CARRIED AND HIS FEELINGS WERE GREATLY
EXCITED AT THE SIGHT OF THE FONDLY RECOLLECTED SPOT
THAT THRESHOLD
WHERE THE NEIGHBOURS' CHILDREN HAD SO OFTEN PLAYED TOGETHER WAS STAINED
WITH BLOOD LOVE AND ATTACHMENT THE NOBLEST FEELINGS OF HUMAN NATURE
HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO VIOLENCE AND MURDER
THE HUGE TREES STOOD THERE
LEAFLESS AND COVERED WITH HOARFROST THE BEAUTIFUL HEDGEROWS WHICH
SURROUNDED THE OLD CHURCHYARD WALL WERE WITHERED AND THE GRAVESTONES
HALF COVERED WITH SNOW WERE VISIBLE THROUGH THE OPENINGS
AS HE APPROACHED THE INN IN FRONT OF WHICH THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS
ASSEMBLED SCREAMS WERE SUDDENLY HEARD
A TROOP OF ARMED PEASANTS WAS
SEEN APPROACHING AND EVERY ONE EXCLAIMED THAT THE CRIMINAL HAD BEEN
APPREHENDED
WERTHER LOOKED AND WAS NOT LONG IN DOUBT
THE PRISONER
WAS NO OTHER THAN THE SERVANT WHO HAD BEEN FORMERLY SO ATTACHED TO THE
WIDOW AND WHOM HE HAD MET PROWLING ABOUT WITH THAT SUPPRESSED ANGER
AND ILL CONCEALED DESPAIR WHICH WE HAVE BEFORE DESCRIBED
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE UNFORTUNATE MAN INQUIRED WERTHER AS HE ADVANCED
TOWARD THE PRISONER
THE LATTER TURNED HIS EYES UPON HIM IN SILENCE AND
THEN REPLIED WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE NO ONE WILL NOW MARRY HER AND
SHE WILL MARRY NO ONE THE PRISONER WAS TAKEN INTO THE INN AND WERTHER
LEFT THE PLACE
THE MIND OF WERTHER WAS FEARFULLY EXCITED BY THIS
SHOCKING OCCURRENCE
HE CEASED HOWEVER TO BE OPPRESSED BY HIS USUAL
FEELING OF MELANCHOLY MOROSENESS AND INDIFFERENCE TO EVERYTHING
THAT PASSED AROUND HIM
HE ENTERTAINED A STRONG DEGREE OF PITY FOR THE
PRISONER AND WAS SEIZED WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE ANXIETY TO SAVE HIM FROM
HIS IMPENDING FATE
HE CONSIDERED HIM SO UNFORTUNATE HE DEEMED HIS
CRIME SO EXCUSABLE AND THOUGHT HIS OWN CONDITION SO NEARLY SIMILAR
THAT HE FELT CONVINCED HE COULD MAKE EVERY ONE ELSE VIEW THE MATTER IN
THE LIGHT IN WHICH HE SAW IT HIMSELF
HE NOW BECAME ANXIOUS TO UNDERTAKE
HIS DEFENCE AND COMMENCED COMPOSING AN ELOQUENT SPEECH FOR THE
OCCASION AND ON HIS WAY TO THE HUNTING LODGE HE COULD NOT REFRAIN
FROM SPEAKING ALOUD THE STATEMENT WHICH HE RESOLVED TO MAKE TO THE
JUDGE
UPON HIS ARRIVAL HE FOUND ALBERT HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM AND HE WAS A
LITTLE PERPLEXED BY THIS MEETING BUT HE SOON RECOVERED HIMSELF AND
EXPRESSED HIS OPINION WITH MUCH WARMTH TO THE JUDGE
THE LATTER SHOOK
HIS HEAD DOUBTINGLY AND ALTHOUGH WERTHER URGED HIS CASE WITH THE UTMOST
ZEAL FEELING AND DETERMINATION IN DEFENCE OF HIS CLIENT YET AS WE
MAY EASILY SUPPOSE THE JUDGE WAS NOT MUCH INFLUENCED BY HIS APPEAL
ON THE CONTRARY HE INTERRUPTED HIM IN HIS ADDRESS REASONED WITH
HIM SERIOUSLY AND EVEN ADMINISTERED A REBUKE TO HIM FOR BECOMING
THE ADVOCATE OF A MURDERER
HE DEMONSTRATED THAT ACCORDING TO THIS
PRECEDENT EVERY LAW MIGHT BE VIOLATED AND THE PUBLIC SECURITY UTTERLY
DESTROYED
HE ADDED MOREOVER THAT IN SUCH A CASE HE COULD HIMSELF DO
NOTHING WITHOUT INCURRING THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY THAT EVERYTHING
MUST FOLLOW IN THE USUAL COURSE AND PURSUE THE ORDINARY CHANNEL
WERTHER HOWEVER DID NOT ABANDON HIS ENTERPRISE AND EVEN BESOUGHT THE
JUDGE TO CONNIVE AT THE FLIGHT OF THE PRISONER
BUT THIS PROPOSAL
WAS PEREMPTORILY REJECTED
ALBERT WHO HAD TAKEN SOME PART IN THE
DISCUSSION COINCIDED IN OPINION WITH THE JUDGE
AT THIS WERTHER BECAME
ENRAGED AND TOOK HIS LEAVE IN GREAT ANGER AFTER THE JUDGE HAD MORE
THAN ONCE ASSURED HIM THAT THE PRISONER COULD NOT BE SAVED
THE EXCESS OF HIS GRIEF AT THIS ASSURANCE MAY BE INFERRED FROM A NOTE WE
HAVE FOUND AMONGST HIS PAPERS AND WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS WRITTEN UPON THIS
VERY OCCASION
YOU CANNOT BE SAVED UNFORTUNATE MAN I SEE CLEARLY THAT WE CANNOT BE
SAVED
WERTHER WAS HIGHLY INCENSED AT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH ALBERT HAD MADE
TO THE JUDGE IN THIS MATTER OF THE PRISONER
HE THOUGHT HE COULD DETECT
THEREIN A LITTLE BITTERNESS TOWARD HIMSELF PERSONALLY AND ALTHOUGH
UPON REFLECTION IT COULD NOT ESCAPE HIS SOUND JUDGMENT THAT THEIR VIEW
OF THE MATTER WAS CORRECT HE FELT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE RELUCTANCE TO
MAKE SUCH AN ADMISSION
A MEMORANDUM OF WERTHER'S UPON THIS POINT EXPRESSIVE OF HIS GENERAL
FEELINGS TOWARD ALBERT HAS BEEN FOUND AMONGST HIS PAPERS
WHAT IS THE USE OF MY CONTINUALLY REPEATING THAT HE IS A GOOD AND
ESTIMABLE MAN HE IS AN INWARD TORMENT TO ME AND I AM INCAPABLE OF
BEING JUST TOWARD HIM
ONE FINE EVENING IN WINTER WHEN THE WEATHER SEEMED INCLINED TO THAW
CHARLOTTE AND ALBERT WERE RETURNING HOME TOGETHER
THE FORMER LOOKED
FROM TIME TO TIME ABOUT HER AS IF SHE MISSED WERTHER'S COMPANY
ALBERT
BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HIM AND CENSURED HIM FOR HIS PREJUDICES
HE
ALLUDED TO HIS UNFORTUNATE ATTACHMENT AND WISHED IT WERE POSSIBLE
TO DISCONTINUE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
I DESIRE IT ON OUR OWN ACCOUNT HE
ADDED AND I REQUEST YOU WILL COMPEL HIM TO ALTER HIS DEPORTMENT TOWARD
YOU AND TO VISIT YOU LESS FREQUENTLY
THE WORLD IS CENSORIOUS AND I
KNOW THAT HERE AND THERE WE ARE SPOKEN OF CHARLOTTE MADE NO REPLY
AND ALBERT SEEMED TO FEEL HER SILENCE
AT LEAST FROM THAT TIME HE NEVER
AGAIN SPOKE OF WERTHER AND WHEN SHE INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT HE ALLOWED
THE CONVERSATION TO DIE AWAY OR ELSE HE DIRECTED THE DISCOURSE INTO
ANOTHER CHANNEL
THE VAIN ATTEMPT WERTHER HAD MADE TO SAVE THE UNHAPPY MURDERER WAS THE
LAST FEEBLE GLIMMERING OF A FLAME ABOUT TO BE EXTINGUISHED
HE SANK
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD INTO A STATE OF GLOOM AND INACTIVITY UNTIL
HE WAS AT LENGTH BROUGHT TO PERFECT DISTRACTION BY LEARNING THAT HE
WAS TO BE SUMMONED AS A WITNESS AGAINST THE PRISONER WHO ASSERTED HIS
COMPLETE INNOCENCE
HIS MIND NOW BECAME OPPRESSED BY THE RECOLLECTION OF EVERY MISFORTUNE
OF HIS PAST LIFE
THE MORTIFICATION HE HAD SUFFERED AT THE AMBASSADOR'S
AND HIS SUBSEQUENT TROUBLES WERE REVIVED IN HIS MEMORY
HE BECAME
UTTERLY INACTIVE
DESTITUTE OF ENERGY HE WAS CUT OFF FROM EVERY PURSUIT
AND OCCUPATION WHICH COMPOSE THE BUSINESS OF COMMON LIFE AND HE BECAME
A VICTIM TO HIS OWN SUSCEPTIBILITY AND TO HIS RESTLESS PASSION FOR THE
MOST AMIABLE AND BELOVED OF WOMEN WHOSE PEACE HE DESTROYED
IN THIS
UNVARYING MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE HIS DAYS WERE CONSUMED AND HIS POWERS
BECAME EXHAUSTED WITHOUT AIM OR DESIGN UNTIL THEY BROUGHT HIM TO A
SORROWFUL END
A FEW LETTERS WHICH HE LEFT BEHIND AND WHICH WE HERE SUBJOIN AFFORD
THE BEST PROOFS OF HIS ANXIETY OF MIND AND OF THE DEPTH OF HIS PASSION
AS WELL AS OF HIS DOUBTS AND STRUGGLES AND OF HIS WEARINESS OF LIFE
DECEMBER 12
DEAR WILHELM I AM REDUCED TO THE CONDITION OF THOSE UNFORTUNATE
WRETCHES WHO BELIEVE THEY ARE PURSUED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT
SOMETIMES I AM
OPPRESSED NOT BY APPREHENSION OR FEAR BUT BY AN INEXPRESSIBLE INTERNAL
SENSATION WHICH WEIGHS UPON MY HEART AND IMPEDES MY BREATH THEN
I WANDER FORTH AT NIGHT EVEN IN THIS TEMPESTUOUS SEASON AND FEEL
PLEASURE IN SURVEYING THE DREADFUL SCENES AROUND ME
YESTERDAY EVENING I WENT FORTH
A RAPID THAW HAD SUDDENLY SET IN I
HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT THE RIVER HAD RISEN THAT THE BROOKS HAD ALL
OVERFLOWED THEIR BANKS AND THAT THE WHOLE VALE OF WALHEIM WAS UNDER
WATER UPON THE STROKE OF TWELVE I HASTENED FORTH
I BEHELD A
FEARFUL SIGHT
THE FOAMING TORRENTS ROLLED FROM THE MOUNTAINS IN THE
MOONLIGHT FIELDS AND MEADOWS TREES AND HEDGES WERE CONFOUNDED
TOGETHER AND THE ENTIRE VALLEY WAS CONVERTED INTO A DEEP LAKE WHICH
WAS AGITATED BY THE ROARING WIND AND WHEN THE MOON SHONE FORTH AND
TINGED THE BLACK CLOUDS WITH SILVER AND THE IMPETUOUS TORRENT AT
MY FEET FOAMED AND RESOUNDED WITH AWFUL AND GRAND IMPETUOSITY I WAS
OVERCOME BY A MINGLED SENSATION OF APPREHENSION AND DELIGHT
WITH
EXTENDED ARMS I LOOKED DOWN INTO THE YAWNING ABYSS AND CRIED
PLUNGE FOR A MOMENT MY SENSES FORSOOK ME IN THE INTENSE DELIGHT OF
ENDING MY SORROWS AND MY SUFFERINGS BY A PLUNGE INTO THAT GULF AND THEN
I FELT AS IF I WERE ROOTED TO THE EARTH AND INCAPABLE OF SEEKING AN END
TO MY WOES BUT MY HOUR IS NOT YET COME I FEEL IT IS NOT
O WILHELM
HOW WILLINGLY COULD I ABANDON MY EXISTENCE TO RIDE THE WHIRLWIND OR TO
EMBRACE THE TORRENT AND THEN MIGHT NOT RAPTURE PERCHANCE BE THE PORTION
OF THIS LIBERATED SOUL
I TURNED MY SORROWFUL EYES TOWARD A FAVOURITE SPOT WHERE I WAS
ACCUSTOMED TO SIT WITH CHARLOTTE BENEATH A WILLOW AFTER A FATIGUING
WALK
ALAS IT WAS COVERED WITH WATER AND WITH DIFFICULTY I FOUND EVEN
THE MEADOW
AND THE FIELDS AROUND THE HUNTING LODGE THOUGHT I
HAS OUR
DEAR BOWER BEEN DESTROYED BY THIS UNPITYING STORM AND A BEAM OF PAST
HAPPINESS STREAMED UPON ME AS THE MIND OF A CAPTIVE IS ILLUMINED BY
DREAMS OF FLOCKS AND HERDS AND BYGONE JOYS OF HOME BUT I AM FREE FROM
BLAME
I HAVE COURAGE TO DIE PERHAPS I HAVE BUT I STILL SIT HERE
LIKE A WRETCHED PAUPER WHO COLLECTS FAGOTS AND BEGS HER BREAD FROM
DOOR TO DOOR THAT SHE MAY PROLONG FOR A FEW DAYS A MISERABLE EXISTENCE
WHICH SHE IS UNWILLING TO RESIGN
DECEMBER 15
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME DEAR WILHELM I AM AFRAID OF MYSELF IS NOT
MY LOVE FOR HER OF THE PUREST MOST HOLY AND MOST BROTHERLY NATURE HAS
MY SOUL EVER BEEN SULLIED BY A SINGLE SENSUAL DESIRE BUT I WILL MAKE NO
PROTESTATIONS
AND NOW YE NIGHTLY VISIONS HOW TRULY HAVE THOSE MORTALS
UNDERSTOOD YOU WHO ASCRIBE YOUR VARIOUS CONTRADICTORY EFFECTS TO SOME
INVINCIBLE POWER THIS NIGHT I TREMBLE AT THE AVOWAL I HELD HER IN MY
ARMS LOCKED IN A CLOSE EMBRACE I PRESSED HER TO MY BOSOM AND COVERED
WITH COUNTLESS KISSES THOSE DEAR LIPS WHICH MURMURED IN REPLY SOFT
PROTESTATIONS OF LOVE
MY SIGHT BECAME CONFUSED BY THE DELICIOUS
INTOXICATION OF HER EYES
HEAVENS IS IT SINFUL TO REVEL AGAIN IN SUCH
HAPPINESS TO RECALL ONCE MORE THOSE RAPTUROUS MOMENTS WITH INTENSE
DELIGHT CHARLOTTE CHARLOTTE I AM LOST MY SENSES ARE BEWILDERED MY
RECOLLECTION IS CONFUSED MINE EYES ARE BATHED IN TEARS I AM ILL AND
YET I AM WELL I WISH FOR NOTHING I HAVE NO DESIRES IT WERE BETTER I
WERE GONE
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES NARRATED ABOVE A DETERMINATION TO QUIT
THIS WORLD HAD NOW TAKEN FIXED POSSESSION OF WERTHER'S SOUL
SINCE
CHARLOTTE'S RETURN THIS THOUGHT HAD BEEN THE FINAL OBJECT OF ALL HIS
HOPES AND WISHES BUT HE HAD RESOLVED THAT SUCH A STEP SHOULD NOT BE
TAKEN WITH PRECIPITATION BUT WITH CALMNESS AND TRANQUILLITY AND WITH
THE MOST PERFECT DELIBERATION
HIS TROUBLES AND INTERNAL STRUGGLES MAY BE UNDERSTOOD FROM THE FOLLOWING
FRAGMENT WHICH WAS FOUND WITHOUT ANY DATE AMONGST HIS PAPERS AND
APPEARS TO HAVE FORMED THE BEGINNING OF A LETTER TO WILHELM
HER PRESENCE HER FATE HER SYMPATHY FOR ME HAVE POWER STILL TO
EXTRACT TEARS FROM MY WITHERED BRAIN
ONE LIFTS UP THE CURTAIN AND PASSES TO THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS
ALL AND WHY ALL THESE DOUBTS AND DELAYS BECAUSE WE KNOW NOT WHAT IS
BEHIND BECAUSE THERE IS NO RETURNING AND BECAUSE OUR MIND INFERS THAT
ALL IS DARKNESS AND CONFUSION WHERE WE HAVE NOTHING BUT UNCERTAINTY
HIS APPEARANCE AT LENGTH BECAME QUITE ALTERED BY THE EFFECT OF HIS
MELANCHOLY THOUGHTS AND HIS RESOLUTION WAS NOW FINALLY AND IRREVOCABLY
TAKEN OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING AMBIGUOUS LETTER WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO
HIS FRIEND MAY APPEAR TO AFFORD SOME PROOF
DECEMBER 20
I AM GRATEFUL TO YOUR LOVE WILHELM FOR HAVING REPEATED YOUR ADVICE SO
SEASONABLY
YES YOU ARE RIGHT IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY BETTER THAT I SHOULD
DEPART
BUT I DO NOT ENTIRELY APPROVE YOUR SCHEME OF RETURNING AT
ONCE TO YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD AT LEAST I SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE A LITTLE
EXCURSION ON THE WAY PARTICULARLY AS WE MAY NOW EXPECT A CONTINUED
FROST AND CONSEQUENTLY GOOD ROADS
I AM MUCH PLEASED WITH YOUR
INTENTION OF COMING TO FETCH ME ONLY DELAY YOUR JOURNEY FOR A
FORTNIGHT AND WAIT FOR ANOTHER LETTER FROM ME
ONE SHOULD GATHER
NOTHING BEFORE IT IS RIPE AND A FORTNIGHT SOONER OR LATER MAKES A GREAT
DIFFERENCE
ENTREAT MY MOTHER TO PRAY FOR HER SON AND TELL HER I BEG
HER PARDON FOR ALL THE UNHAPPINESS I HAVE OCCASIONED HER
IT HAS
EVER BEEN MY FATE TO GIVE PAIN TO THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I SHOULD HAVE
PROMOTED
ADIEU MY DEAREST FRIEND
MAY EVERY BLESSING OF HEAVEN ATTEND
YOU FAREWELL
WE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO EXPRESS THE EMOTIONS WITH WHICH CHARLOTTE'S SOUL
WAS AGITATED DURING THE WHOLE OF THIS TIME WHETHER IN RELATION TO HER
HUSBAND OR TO HER UNFORTUNATE FRIEND ALTHOUGH WE ARE ENABLED BY OUR
KNOWLEDGE OF HER CHARACTER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NATURE
IT IS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD FORMED A DETERMINATION BY EVERY MEANS IN
HER POWER TO KEEP WERTHER AT A DISTANCE AND IF SHE HESITATED IN HER
DECISION IT WAS FROM A SINCERE FEELING OF FRIENDLY PITY KNOWING HOW
MUCH IT WOULD COST HIM INDEED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO COMPLY WITH HER WISHES
BUT VARIOUS CAUSES NOW URGED HER TO BE FIRM
HER HUSBAND PRESERVED A STRICT SILENCE ABOUT THE WHOLE MATTER AND SHE
NEVER MADE IT A SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION FEELING BOUND TO PROVE TO HIM
BY HER CONDUCT THAT HER SENTIMENTS AGREED WITH HIS
THE SAME DAY WHICH WAS THE SUNDAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AFTER WERTHER HAD
WRITTEN THE LAST MENTIONED LETTER TO HIS FRIEND HE CAME IN THE EVENING
TO CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE AND FOUND HER ALONE
SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING SOME
LITTLE GIFTS FOR HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHICH WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED
TO THEM ON CHRISTMAS DAY
HE BEGAN TALKING OF THE DELIGHT OF
THE CHILDREN AND OF THAT AGE WHEN THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF THE
CHRISTMAS TREE DECORATED WITH FRUIT AND SWEETMEATS AND LIGHTED UP WITH
WAX CANDLES CAUSES SUCH TRANSPORTS OF JOY
YOU SHALL HAVE A GIFT TOO
IF YOU BEHAVE WELL SAID CHARLOTTE HIDING HER EMBARRASSMENT UNDER
SWEET SMILE
AND WHAT DO YOU CALL BEHAVING WELL WHAT SHOULD I DO WHAT
CAN I DO MY DEAR CHARLOTTE SAID HE
THURSDAY NIGHT SHE ANSWERED
IS CHRISTMAS EVE
THE CHILDREN ARE ALL TO BE HERE AND MY FATHER TOO
THERE IS A PRESENT FOR EACH DO YOU COME LIKEWISE BUT DO NOT COME
BEFORE THAT TIME WERTHER STARTED
I DESIRE YOU WILL NOT IT MUST BE
SO SHE CONTINUED
I ASK IT OF YOU AS A FAVOUR FOR MY OWN PEACE AND
TRANQUILLITY
WE CANNOT GO ON IN THIS MANNER ANY LONGER HE TURNED AWAY
HIS FACE WALKED HASTILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY
WE CANNOT GO ON IN THIS MANNER ANY LONGER CHARLOTTE SEEING THE
VIOLENT AGITATION INTO WHICH THESE WORDS HAD THROWN HIM ENDEAVOURED
TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS BY DIFFERENT QUESTIONS BUT IN VAIN
NO
CHARLOTTE HE EXCLAIMED I WILL NEVER SEE YOU ANY MORE AND WHY SO
SHE ANSWERED
WE MAY WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN ONLY LET IT BE
WITH MORE DISCRETION
OH WHY WERE YOU BORN WITH THAT EXCESSIVE THAT
UNGOVERNABLE PASSION FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS DEAR TO YOU THEN TAKING
HIS HAND SHE SAID I ENTREAT OF YOU TO BE MORE CALM YOUR TALENTS
YOUR UNDERSTANDING YOUR GENIUS WILL FURNISH YOU WITH A THOUSAND
RESOURCES
BE A MAN AND CONQUER AN UNHAPPY ATTACHMENT TOWARD A CREATURE
WHO CAN DO NOTHING BUT PITY YOU HE BIT HIS LIPS AND LOOKED AT HER
WITH A GLOOMY COUNTENANCE
SHE CONTINUED TO HOLD HIS HAND
GRANT ME BUT
A MOMENT'S PATIENCE WERTHER SHE SAID
DO YOU NOT SEE THAT YOU ARE
DECEIVING YOURSELF THAT YOU ARE SEEKING YOUR OWN DESTRUCTION WHY MUST
YOU LOVE ME ME ONLY WHO BELONG TO ANOTHER I FEAR I MUCH FEAR THAT
IT IS ONLY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF POSSESSING ME WHICH MAKES YOUR DESIRE
FOR ME SO STRONG HE DREW BACK HIS HAND WHILST HE SURVEYED HER WITH A
WILD AND ANGRY LOOK
'TIS WELL HE EXCLAIMED 'TIS VERY WELL DID NOT
ALBERT FURNISH YOU WITH THIS REFLECTION IT IS PROFOUND A VERY PROFOUND
REMARK A REFLECTION THAT ANY ONE MIGHT EASILY MAKE SHE ANSWERED
AND IS THERE NOT A WOMAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO IS AT LIBERTY AND HAS
THE POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY CONQUER YOURSELF LOOK FOR SUCH A BEING
AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY FIND HER
I HAVE LONG
FELT FOR YOU AND FOR US ALL YOU HAVE CONFINED YOURSELF TOO LONG WITHIN
THE LIMITS OF TOO NARROW A CIRCLE
CONQUER YOURSELF MAKE AN EFFORT A
SHORT JOURNEY WILL BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
SEEK AND FIND AN OBJECT WORTHY
OF YOUR LOVE THEN RETURN HITHER AND LET US ENJOY TOGETHER ALL THE
HAPPINESS OF THE MOST PERFECT FRIENDSHIP
THIS SPEECH REPLIED WERTHER WITH A COLD SMILE THIS SPEECH SHOULD
BE PRINTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL TEACHERS
MY DEAR CHARLOTTE ALLOW ME
BUT A SHORT TIME LONGER AND ALL WILL BE WELL BUT HOWEVER WERTHER
SHE ADDED DO NOT COME AGAIN BEFORE CHRISTMAS HE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE
SOME ANSWER WHEN ALBERT CAME IN
THEY SALUTED EACH OTHER COLDLY AND
WITH MUTUAL EMBARRASSMENT PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
WERTHER MADE
SOME COMMON REMARKS ALBERT DID THE SAME AND THEIR CONVERSATION SOON
DROPPED
ALBERT ASKED HIS WIFE ABOUT SOME HOUSEHOLD MATTERS AND
FINDING THAT HIS COMMISSIONS WERE NOT EXECUTED HE USED SOME EXPRESSIONS
WHICH TO WERTHER'S EAR SAVOURED OF EXTREME HARSHNESS
HE WISHED TO GO
BUT HAD NOT POWER TO MOVE AND IN THIS SITUATION HE REMAINED TILL EIGHT
O'CLOCK HIS UNEASINESS AND DISCONTENT CONTINUALLY INCREASING
AT LENGTH
THE CLOTH WAS LAID FOR SUPPER AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT AND STICK
ALBERT
INVITED HIM TO REMAIN BUT WERTHER FANCYING THAT HE WAS MERELY PAYING A
FORMAL COMPLIMENT THANKED HIM COLDLY AND LEFT THE HOUSE
WERTHER RETURNED HOME TOOK THE CANDLE FROM HIS SERVANT AND RETIRED
TO HIS ROOM ALONE
HE TALKED FOR SOME TIME WITH GREAT EARNESTNESS TO
HIMSELF WEPT ALOUD WALKED IN A STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT THROUGH HIS
CHAMBER TILL AT LENGTH WITHOUT UNDRESSING HE THREW HIMSELF ON THE
BED WHERE HE WAS FOUND BY HIS SERVANT AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE
LATTER VENTURED TO ENTER THE ROOM AND TAKE OFF HIS BOOTS
WERTHER DID
NOT PREVENT HIM BUT FORBADE HIM TO COME IN THE MORNING TILL HE SHOULD
RING
ON MONDAY MORNING THE 21ST OF DECEMBER HE WROTE TO CHARLOTTE THE
FOLLOWING LETTER WHICH WAS FOUND SEALED ON HIS BUREAU AFTER HIS
DEATH AND WAS GIVEN TO HER
I SHALL INSERT IT IN FRAGMENTS AS IT
APPEARS FROM SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THAT
MANNER
IT IS ALL OVER CHARLOTTE I AM RESOLVED TO DIE I MAKE THIS
DECLARATION DELIBERATELY AND COOLLY WITHOUT ANY ROMANTIC PASSION ON
THIS MORNING OF THE DAY WHEN I AM TO SEE YOU FOR THE LAST TIME
AT THE
MOMENT YOU READ THESE LINES O BEST OF WOMEN THE COLD GRAVE WILL HOLD
THE INANIMATE REMAINS OF THAT RESTLESS AND UNHAPPY BEING WHO IN THE
LAST MOMENTS OF HIS EXISTENCE KNEW NO PLEASURE SO GREAT AS THAT OF
CONVERSING WITH YOU I HAVE PASSED A DREADFUL NIGHT OR RATHER LET ME
SAY A PROPITIOUS ONE FOR IT HAS GIVEN ME RESOLUTION IT HAS FIXED MY
PURPOSE
I AM RESOLVED TO DIE
WHEN I TORE MYSELF FROM YOU YESTERDAY
MY SENSES WERE IN TUMULT AND DISORDER MY HEART WAS OPPRESSED HOPE AND
PLEASURE HAD FLED FROM ME FOR EVER AND A PETRIFYING COLD HAD SEIZED
MY WRETCHED BEING
I COULD SCARCELY REACH MY ROOM
I THREW MYSELF ON
MY KNEES AND HEAVEN FOR THE LAST TIME GRANTED ME THE CONSOLATION OF
SHEDDING TEARS
A THOUSAND IDEAS A THOUSAND SCHEMES AROSE WITHIN MY
SOUL TILL AT LENGTH ONE LAST FIXED FINAL THOUGHT TOOK POSSESSION OF
MY HEART
IT WAS TO DIE
I LAY DOWN TO REST AND IN THE MORNING IN THE
QUIET HOUR OF AWAKENING THE SAME DETERMINATION WAS UPON ME
TO DIE IT
IS NOT DESPAIR IT IS CONVICTION THAT I HAVE FILLED UP THE MEASURE OF
MY SUFFERINGS THAT I HAVE REACHED MY APPOINTED TERM AND MUST SACRIFICE
MYSELF FOR THEE
YES CHARLOTTE WHY SHOULD I NOT AVOW IT ONE OF US
THREE MUST DIE IT SHALL BE WERTHER
O BELOVED CHARLOTTE THIS HEART
EXCITED BY RAGE AND FURY HAS OFTEN CONCEIVED THE HORRID IDEA OF
MURDERING YOUR HUSBAND YOU MYSELF THE LOT IS CAST AT LENGTH
AND IN
THE BRIGHT QUIET EVENINGS OF SUMMER WHEN YOU SOMETIMES WANDER TOWARD
THE MOUNTAINS LET YOUR THOUGHTS THEN TURN TO ME RECOLLECT HOW OFTEN
YOU HAVE WATCHED ME COMING TO MEET YOU FROM THE VALLEY THEN BEND YOUR
EYES UPON THE CHURCHYARD WHICH CONTAINS MY GRAVE AND BY THE LIGHT OF
THE SETTING SUN MARK HOW THE EVENING BREEZE WAVES THE TALL GRASS
WHICH GROWS ABOVE MY TOMB
I WAS CALM WHEN I BEGAN THIS LETTER BUT THE
RECOLLECTION OF THESE SCENES MAKES ME WEEP LIKE A CHILD
ABOUT TEN IN THE MORNING WERTHER CALLED HIS SERVANT AND WHILST HE
WAS DRESSING TOLD HIM THAT IN A FEW DAYS HE INTENDED TO SET OUT UPON
A JOURNEY AND BADE HIM THEREFORE LAY HIS CLOTHES IN ORDER AND PREPARE
THEM FOR PACKING UP CALL IN ALL HIS ACCOUNTS FETCH HOME THE BOOKS
HE HAD LENT AND GIVE TWO MONTHS' PAY TO THE POOR DEPENDANTS WHO WERE
ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE FROM HIM A WEEKLY ALLOWANCE
HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS ROOM AND THEN MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND WENT TO
VISIT THE STEWARD WHO HOWEVER WAS NOT AT HOME
HE WALKED PENSIVELY
IN THE GARDEN AND SEEMED ANXIOUS TO RENEW ALL THE IDEAS THAT WERE MOST
PAINFUL TO HIM
THE CHILDREN DID NOT SUFFER HIM TO REMAIN ALONE LONG
THEY FOLLOWED HIM
SKIPPING AND DANCING BEFORE HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT AFTER TO MORROW AND
TOMORROW AND ONE DAY MORE THEY WERE TO RECEIVE THEIR CHRISTMAS GIFT
FROM CHARLOTTE AND THEY THEN RECOUNTED ALL THE WONDERS OF WHICH THEY
HAD FORMED IDEAS IN THEIR CHILD IMAGINATIONS
TOMORROW AND TOMORROW
SAID HE AND ONE DAY MORE AND HE KISSED THEM TENDERLY
HE WAS GOING
BUT THE YOUNGER BOY STOPPED HIM TO WHISPER SOMETHING IN HIS EAR
HE
TOLD HIM THAT HIS ELDER BROTHERS HAD WRITTEN SPLENDID NEW YEAR'S WISHES
SO LARGE ONE FOR PAPA AND ANOTHER FOR ALBERT AND CHARLOTTE AND ONE
FOR WERTHER AND THEY WERE TO BE PRESENTED EARLY IN THE MORNING ON
NEW YEAR'S DAY
THIS QUITE OVERCAME HIM
HE MADE EACH OF THE CHILDREN
A PRESENT MOUNTED HIS HORSE LEFT HIS COMPLIMENTS FOR PAPA AND MAMMA
AND WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES RODE AWAY FROM THE PLACE
HE RETURNED HOME ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK ORDERED HIS SERVANT TO KEEP UP
HIS FIRE DESIRED HIM TO PACK HIS BOOKS AND LINEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
TRUNK AND TO PLACE HIS COATS AT THE TOP
HE THEN APPEARS TO HAVE MADE
THE FOLLOWING ADDITION TO THE LETTER ADDRESSED TO CHARLOTTE
YOU DO NOT EXPECT ME
YOU THINK I WILL OBEY YOU AND NOT VISIT YOU
AGAIN TILL CHRISTMAS EVE
O CHARLOTTE TODAY OR NEVER ON CHRISTMAS EVE
YOU WILL HOLD THIS PAPER IN YOUR HAND YOU WILL TREMBLE AND MOISTEN IT
WITH YOUR TEARS
I WILL I MUST OH HOW HAPPY I FEEL TO BE DETERMINED
IN THE MEANTIME CHARLOTTE WAS IN A PITIABLE STATE OF MIND
AFTER HER
LAST CONVERSATION WITH WERTHER SHE FOUND HOW PAINFUL TO HERSELF IT
WOULD BE TO DECLINE HIS VISITS AND KNEW HOW SEVERELY HE WOULD SUFFER
FROM THEIR SEPARATION
SHE HAD IN CONVERSATION WITH ALBERT MENTIONED CASUALLY THAT WERTHER
WOULD NOT RETURN BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE AND SOON AFTERWARD ALBERT WENT
ON HORSEBACK TO SEE A PERSON IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH WHOM HE HAD TO
TRANSACT SOME BUSINESS WHICH WOULD DETAIN HIM ALL NIGHT
CHARLOTTE WAS SITTING ALONE
NONE OF HER FAMILY WERE NEAR AND SHE GAVE
HERSELF UP TO THE REFLECTIONS THAT SILENTLY TOOK POSSESSION OF HER MIND
SHE WAS FOR EVER UNITED TO A HUSBAND WHOSE LOVE AND FIDELITY SHE HAD
PROVED TO WHOM SHE WAS HEARTILY DEVOTED AND WHO SEEMED TO BE A SPECIAL
GIFT FROM HEAVEN TO ENSURE HER HAPPINESS
ON THE OTHER HAND WERTHER HAD
BECOME DEAR TO HER
THERE WAS A CORDIAL UNANIMITY OF SENTIMENT BETWEEN
THEM FROM THE VERY FIRST HOUR OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AND THEIR LONG
ASSOCIATION AND REPEATED INTERVIEWS HAD MADE AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION
UPON HER HEART
SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO COMMUNICATE TO HIM EVERY
THOUGHT AND FEELING WHICH INTERESTED HER AND HIS ABSENCE THREATENED TO
OPEN A VOID IN HER EXISTENCE WHICH IT MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FILL
HOW
HEARTILY SHE WISHED THAT SHE MIGHT CHANGE HIM INTO HER BROTHER THAT
SHE COULD INDUCE HIM TO MARRY ONE OF HER OWN FRIENDS OR COULD
REESTABLISH HIS INTIMACY WITH ALBERT
SHE PASSED ALL HER INTIMATE FRIENDS IN REVIEW BEFORE HER MIND BUT FOUND
SOMETHING OBJECTIONABLE IN EACH AND COULD DECIDE UPON NONE TO WHOM SHE
WOULD CONSENT TO GIVE HIM
AMID ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS SHE FELT DEEPLY BUT INDISTINCTLY THAT HER
OWN REAL BUT UNEXPRESSED WISH WAS TO RETAIN HIM FOR HERSELF AND HER
PURE AND AMIABLE HEART FELT FROM THIS THOUGHT A SENSE OF OPPRESSION
WHICH SEEMED TO FORBID A PROSPECT OF HAPPINESS
SHE WAS WRETCHED A DARK
CLOUD OBSCURED HER MENTAL VISION
IT WAS NOW HALF PAST SIX O'CLOCK AND SHE HEARD WERTHER'S STEP ON THE
STAIRS
SHE AT ONCE RECOGNISED HIS VOICE AS HE INQUIRED IF SHE WERE AT
HOME
HER HEART BEAT AUDIBLY WE COULD ALMOST SAY FOR THE FIRST TIME AT
HIS ARRIVAL
IT WAS TOO LATE TO DENY HERSELF AND AS HE ENTERED SHE
EXCLAIMED WITH A SORT OF ILL CONCEALED CONFUSION YOU HAVE NOT KEPT
YOUR WORD I PROMISED NOTHING HE ANSWERED
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE
COMPLIED AT LEAST FOR MY SAKE SHE CONTINUED
I IMPLORE YOU FOR BOTH
OUR SAKES
SHE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT SHE SAID OR DID AND SENT FOR SOME FRIENDS WHO
BY THEIR PRESENCE MIGHT PREVENT HER BEING LEFT ALONE WITH WERTHER
HE
PUT DOWN SOME BOOKS HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN MADE INQUIRIES ABOUT
SOME OTHERS UNTIL SHE BEGAN TO HOPE THAT HER FRIENDS MIGHT ARRIVE
SHORTLY ENTERTAINING AT THE SAME TIME A DESIRE THAT THEY MIGHT STAY
AWAY
AT ONE MOMENT SHE FELT ANXIOUS THAT THE SERVANT SHOULD REMAIN IN THE
ADJOINING ROOM THEN SHE CHANGED HER MIND
WERTHER MEANWHILE WALKED
IMPATIENTLY UP AND DOWN
SHE WENT TO THE PIANO AND DETERMINED NOT
TO RETIRE
SHE THEN COLLECTED HER THOUGHTS AND SAT DOWN QUIETLY AT
WERTHER'S SIDE WHO HAD TAKEN HIS USUAL PLACE ON THE SOFA
HAVE YOU BROUGHT NOTHING TO READ SHE INQUIRED
HE HAD NOTHING
THERE
IN MY DRAWER SHE CONTINUED YOU WILL FIND YOUR OWN TRANSLATION OF
SOME OF THE SONGS OF OSSIAN
I HAVE NOT YET READ THEM AS I HAVE STILL
HOPED TO HEAR YOU RECITE THEM BUT FOR SOME TIME PAST I HAVE NOT BEEN
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH A WISH HE SMILED AND WENT FOR THE MANUSCRIPT
WHICH HE TOOK WITH A SHUDDER
HE SAT DOWN AND WITH EYES FULL OF TEARS
HE BEGAN TO READ

MY TEARS O RYNO ARE FOR THE DEAD MY VOICE FOR THOSE THAT HAVE
PASSED AWAY
TALL THOU ART ON THE HILL FAIR AMONG THE SONS OF THE VALE
BUT THOU SHALT FALL LIKE MORAR THE MOURNER SHALL SIT ON THY TOMB
THE
HILLS SHALL KNOW THEE NO MORE THY BOW SHALL LIE IN THY HALL UNSTRUNG
THOU WERT SWIFT O MORAR AS A ROE ON THE DESERT TERRIBLE AS A METEOR
OF FIRE
THY WRATH WAS AS THE STORM
THY SWORD IN BATTLE AS LIGHTNING IN
THE FIELD
THY VOICE WAS AS A STREAM AFTER RAIN LIKE THUNDER ON DISTANT
HILLS
MANY FELL BY THY ARM THEY WERE CONSUMED IN THE FLAMES OF THY
WRATH
BUT WHEN THOU DIDST RETURN FROM WAR HOW PEACEFUL WAS THY BROW
THY FACE WAS LIKE THE SUN AFTER RAIN LIKE THE MOON IN THE SILENCE OF
NIGHT CALM AS THE BREAST OF THE LAKE WHEN THE LOUD WIND IS LAID
NARROW IS THY DWELLING NOW DARK THE PLACE OF THINE ABODE WITH THREE
STEPS I COMPASS THY GRAVE O THOU WHO WAST SO GREAT BEFORE FOUR STONES
WITH THEIR HEADS OF MOSS ARE THE ONLY MEMORIAL OF THEE
A TREE WITH
SCARCE A LEAF LONG GRASS WHICH WHISTLES IN THE WIND MARK TO THE
HUNTER'S EYE THE GRAVE OF THE MIGHTY MORAR
MORAR THOU ART LOW INDEED
THOU HAST NO MOTHER TO MOURN THEE NO MAID WITH HER TEARS OF LOVE
DEAD
IS SHE THAT BROUGHT THEE FORTH
FALLEN IS THE DAUGHTER OF MORGLAN
WHO ON HIS STAFF IS THIS WHO IS THIS WHOSE HEAD IS WHITE WITH AGE
WHOSE EYES ARE RED WITH TEARS WHO QUAKES AT EVERY STEP IT IS THY
FATHER O MORAR THE FATHER OF NO SON BUT THEE
HE HEARD OF THY FAME IN
WAR HE HEARD OF FOES DISPERSED
HE HEARD OF MORAR'S RENOWN WHY DID
HE NOT HEAR OF HIS WOUND WEEP THOU FATHER OF MORAR WEEP BUT THY SON
HEARETH THEE NOT
DEEP IS THE SLEEP OF THE DEAD LOW THEIR PILLOW OF
DUST
NO MORE SHALL HE HEAR THY VOICE NO MORE AWAKE AT THY CALL
WHEN
SHALL IT BE MORN IN THE GRAVE TO BID THE SLUMBERER AWAKE FAREWELL
THOU BRAVEST OF MEN THOU CONQUEROR IN THE FIELD BUT THE FIELD SHALL
SEE THEE NO MORE NOR THE DARK WOOD BE LIGHTENED WITH THE SPLENDOUR
OF THY STEEL
THOU HAS LEFT NO SON
THE SONG SHALL PRESERVE THY NAME
FUTURE TIMES SHALL HEAR OF THEE THEY SHALL HEAR OF THE FALLEN MORAR
THE GRIEF OF ALL AROSE BUT MOST THE BURSTING SIGH OF ARMIN
HE
REMEMBERS THE DEATH OF HIS SON WHO FELL IN THE DAYS OF HIS YOUTH
CARMOR WAS NEAR THE HERO THE CHIEF OF THE ECHOING GALMAL
WHY BURST THE
SIGH OF ARMIN HE SAID
IS THERE A CAUSE TO MOURN THE SONG COMES WITH
ITS MUSIC TO MELT AND PLEASE THE SOUL
IT IS LIKE SOFT MIST THAT RISING
FROM A LAKE POURS ON THE SILENT VALE THE GREEN FLOWERS ARE FILLED WITH
DEW BUT THE SUN RETURNS IN HIS STRENGTH AND THE MIST IS GONE
WHY ART
THOU SAD O ARMIN CHIEF OF SEA SURROUNDED GORMA
SAD I AM NOR SMALL IS MY CAUSE OF WOE CARMOR THOU HAST LOST NO SON
THOU HAST LOST NO DAUGHTER OF BEAUTY
COLGAR THE VALIANT LIVES AND
ANNIRA FAIREST MAID
THE BOUGHS OF THY HOUSE ASCEND O CARMOR BUT
ARMIN IS THE LAST OF HIS RACE
DARK IS THY BED O DAURA DEEP THY SLEEP
IN THE TOMB WHEN SHALT THOU WAKE WITH THY SONGS WITH ALL THY VOICE OF
MUSIC
ARISE WINDS OF AUTUMN ARISE BLOW ALONG THE HEATH
STREAMS OF THE
MOUNTAINS ROAR ROAR TEMPESTS IN THE GROVES OF MY OAKS WALK THROUGH
BROKEN CLOUDS O MOON SHOW THY PALE FACE AT INTERVALS BRING TO MY MIND
THE NIGHT WHEN ALL MY CHILDREN FELL WHEN ARINDAL THE MIGHTY FELL WHEN
DAURA THE LOVELY FAILED
DAURA MY DAUGHTER THOU WERT FAIR FAIR AS
THE MOON ON FURA WHITE AS THE DRIVEN SNOW SWEET AS THE BREATHING GALE
ARINDAL THY BOW WAS STRONG THY SPEAR WAS SWIFT ON THE FIELD THY LOOK
WAS LIKE MIST ON THE WAVE THY SHIELD A RED CLOUD IN A STORM ARMAR
RENOWNED IN WAR CAME AND SOUGHT DAURA'S LOVE
HE WAS NOT LONG REFUSED
FAIR WAS THE HOPE OF THEIR FRIENDS
ERATH SON OF ODGAL REPINED HIS BROTHER HAD BEEN SLAIN BY ARMAR
HE
CAME DISGUISED LIKE A SON OF THE SEA FAIR WAS HIS CLIFF ON THE WAVE
WHITE HIS LOCKS OF AGE CALM HIS SERIOUS BROW
FAIREST OF WOMEN HE
SAID LOVELY DAUGHTER OF ARMIN A ROCK NOT DISTANT IN THE SEA BEARS
A TREE ON ITS SIDE RED SHINES THE FRUIT AFAR
THERE ARMAR WAITS FOR
DAURA
I COME TO CARRY HIS LOVE SHE WENT SHE CALLED ON ARMAR
NOUGHT
ANSWERED BUT THE SON OF THE ROCK
ARMAR MY LOVE MY LOVE WHY
TORMENTEST THOU ME WITH FEAR HEAR SON OF ARNART HEAR IT IS DAURA WHO
CALLETH THEE
ERATH THE TRAITOR FLED LAUGHING TO THE LAND
SHE LIFTED
UP HER VOICE SHE CALLED FOR HER BROTHER AND HER FATHER
ARINDAL ARMIN
NONE TO RELIEVE YOU DAURA
HER VOICE CAME OVER THE SEA
ARINDAL MY SON DESCENDED FROM THE HILL
ROUGH IN THE SPOILS OF THE CHASE
HIS ARROWS RATTLED BY HIS SIDE HIS
BOW WAS IN HIS HAND FIVE DARK GRAY DOGS ATTENDED HIS STEPS
HE SAW
FIERCE ERATH ON THE SHORE HE SEIZED AND BOUND HIM TO AN OAK
THICK WIND
THE THONGS OF THE HIDE AROUND HIS LIMBS HE LOADS THE WINDS WITH HIS
GROANS
ARINDAL ASCENDS THE DEEP IN HIS BOAT TO BRING DAURA TO LAND
ARMAR CAME IN HIS WRATH AND LET FLY THE GRAY FEATHERED SHAFT
IT SUNG
IT SUNK IN THY HEART O ARINDAL MY SON FOR ERATH THE TRAITOR THOU
DIEST
THE OAR IS STOPPED AT ONCE HE PANTED ON THE ROCK AND EXPIRED
WHAT IS THY GRIEF O DAURA WHEN ROUND THY FEET IS POURED THY BROTHER'S
BLOOD
THE BOAT IS BROKEN IN TWAIN
ARMAR PLUNGES INTO THE SEA TO RESCUE
HIS DAURA OR DIE
SUDDEN A BLAST FROM A HILL CAME OVER THE WAVES HE
SANK AND HE ROSE NO MORE
ALONE ON THE SEA BEAT ROCK MY DAUGHTER WAS HEARD TO COMPLAIN
FREQUENT AND LOUD WERE HER CRIES
WHAT COULD HER FATHER DO ALL NIGHT I
STOOD ON THE SHORE I SAW HER BY THE FAINT BEAM OF THE MOON
ALL NIGHT
I HEARD HER CRIES
LOUD WAS THE WIND THE RAIN BEAT HARD ON THE HILL
BEFORE MORNING APPEARED HER VOICE WAS WEAK IT DIED AWAY LIKE THE
EVENING BREEZE AMONG THE GRASS OF THE ROCKS
SPENT WITH GRIEF SHE
EXPIRED AND LEFT THEE ARMIN ALONE
GONE IS MY STRENGTH IN WAR FALLEN
MY PRIDE AMONG WOMEN
WHEN THE STORMS ALOFT ARISE WHEN THE NORTH LIFTS
THE WAVE ON HIGH I SIT BY THE SOUNDING SHORE AND LOOK ON THE FATAL
ROCK
OFTEN BY THE SETTING MOON I SEE THE GHOSTS OF MY CHILDREN HALF
VIEWLESS THEY WALK IN MOURNFUL CONFERENCE TOGETHER
A TORRENT OF TEARS WHICH STREAMED FROM CHARLOTTE'S EYES AND GAVE RELIEF
TO HER BURSTING HEART STOPPED WERTHER'S RECITATION
HE THREW DOWN THE
BOOK SEIZED HER HAND AND WEPT BITTERLY
CHARLOTTE LEANED UPON HER
HAND AND BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDKERCHIEF THE AGITATION OF BOTH WAS
EXCESSIVE
THEY FELT THAT THEIR OWN FATE WAS PICTURED IN THE MISFORTUNES
OF OSSIAN'S HEROES THEY FELT THIS TOGETHER AND THEIR TEARS REDOUBLED
WERTHER SUPPORTED HIS FOREHEAD ON CHARLOTTE'S ARM SHE TREMBLED SHE
WISHED TO BE GONE BUT SORROW AND SYMPATHY LAY LIKE A LEADEN WEIGHT UPON
HER SOUL
SHE RECOVERED HERSELF SHORTLY AND BEGGED WERTHER WITH BROKEN
SOBS TO LEAVE HER IMPLORED HIM WITH THE UTMOST EARNESTNESS TO COMPLY
WITH HER REQUEST
HE TREMBLED HIS HEART WAS READY TO BURST THEN
TAKING UP THE BOOK AGAIN HE RECOMMENCED READING IN A VOICE BROKEN BY
SOBS
WHY DOST THOU WAKEN ME O SPRING THY VOICE WOOS ME EXCLAIMING
I REFRESH THEE WITH HEAVENLY DEWS BUT THE TIME OF MY DECAY IS
APPROACHING THE STORM IS NIGH THAT SHALL WHITHER MY LEAVES
TOMORROW
THE TRAVELLER SHALL COME HE SHALL COME WHO BEHELD ME IN BEAUTY HIS
EYE SHALL SEEK ME IN THE FIELD AROUND BUT HE SHALL NOT FIND ME
THE WHOLE FORCE OF THESE WORDS FELL UPON THE UNFORTUNATE WERTHER
FULL
OF DESPAIR HE THREW HIMSELF AT CHARLOTTE'S FEET SEIZED HER HANDS AND
PRESSED THEM TO HIS EYES AND TO HIS FOREHEAD
AN APPREHENSION OF
HIS FATAL PROJECT NOW STRUCK HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
HER SENSES WERE
BEWILDERED SHE HELD HIS HANDS PRESSED THEM TO HER BOSOM AND LEANING
TOWARD HIM WITH EMOTIONS OF THE TENDEREST PITY HER WARM CHEEK TOUCHED
HIS
THEY LOST SIGHT OF EVERYTHING
THE WORLD DISAPPEARED FROM THEIR
EYES
HE CLASPED HER IN HIS ARMS STRAINED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND COVERED
HER TREMBLING LIPS WITH PASSIONATE KISSES
WERTHER SHE CRIED WITH A
FAINT VOICE TURNING HERSELF AWAY WERTHER AND WITH A FEEBLE HAND
SHE PUSHED HIM FROM HER
AT LENGTH WITH THE FIRM VOICE OF VIRTUE SHE
EXCLAIMED WERTHER HE RESISTED NOT BUT TEARING HIMSELF FROM HER
ARMS FELL ON HIS KNEES BEFORE HER
CHARLOTTE ROSE AND WITH DISORDERED
GRIEF IN MINGLED TONES OF LOVE AND RESENTMENT SHE EXCLAIMED IT IS
THE LAST TIME WERTHER YOU SHALL NEVER SEE ME ANY MORE THEN CASTING
ONE LAST TENDER LOOK UPON HER UNFORTUNATE LOVER SHE RUSHED INTO THE
ADJOINING ROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR
WERTHER HELD OUT HIS ARMS BUT
DID NOT DARE TO DETAIN HER
HE CONTINUED ON THE GROUND WITH HIS HEAD
RESTING ON THE SOFA FOR HALF AN HOUR TILL HE HEARD A NOISE WHICH
BROUGHT HIM TO HIS SENSES
THE SERVANT ENTERED
HE THEN WALKED UP AND
DOWN THE ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS AGAIN LEFT ALONE HE WENT TO CHARLOTTE'S
DOOR AND IN A LOW VOICE SAID CHARLOTTE CHARLOTTE BUT ONE WORD
MORE ONE LAST ADIEU SHE RETURNED NO ANSWER
HE STOPPED AND LISTENED
AND ENTREATED BUT ALL WAS SILENT
AT LENGTH HE TORE HIMSELF FROM THE
PLACE CRYING ADIEU CHARLOTTE ADIEU FOR EVER
WERTHER RAN TO THE GATE OF THE TOWN
THE GUARDS WHO KNEW HIM LET HIM
PASS IN SILENCE
THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND STORMY IT RAINED AND SNOWED
HE REACHED HIS OWN DOOR ABOUT ELEVEN
HIS SERVANT ALTHOUGH SEEING HIM
ENTER THE HOUSE WITHOUT HIS HAT DID NOT VENTURE TO SAY ANYTHING AND
AS HE UNDRESSED HIS MASTER HE FOUND THAT HIS CLOTHES WERE WET
HIS HAT
WAS AFTERWARD FOUND ON THE POINT OF A ROCK OVERHANGING THE VALLEY AND
IT IS INCONCEIVABLE HOW HE COULD HAVE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT ON SUCH A
DARK TEMPESTUOUS NIGHT WITHOUT LOSING HIS LIFE
HE RETIRED TO BED AND SLEPT TO A LATE HOUR
THE NEXT MORNING HIS
SERVANT UPON BEING CALLED TO BRING HIS COFFEE FOUND HIM WRITING
HE
WAS ADDING TO CHARLOTTE WHAT WE HERE ANNEX
FOR THE LAST LAST TIME I OPEN THESE EYES
ALAS THEY WILL BEHOLD THE
SUN NO MORE
IT IS COVERED BY A THICK IMPENETRABLE CLOUD
YES NATURE
PUT ON MOURNING YOUR CHILD YOUR FRIEND YOUR LOVER DRAWS NEAR HIS
END THIS THOUGHT CHARLOTTE IS WITHOUT PARALLEL AND YET IT SEEMS
LIKE A MYSTERIOUS DREAM WHEN I REPEAT THIS IS MY LAST DAY THE LAST
CHARLOTTE NO WORD CAN ADEQUATELY EXPRESS THIS THOUGHT
THE LAST TO DAY
I STAND ERECT IN ALL MY STRENGTH TO MORROW COLD AND STARK I SHALL LIE
EXTENDED UPON THE GROUND
TO DIE WHAT IS DEATH WE DO BUT DREAM IN OUR
DISCOURSE UPON IT
I HAVE SEEN MANY HUMAN BEINGS DIE BUT SO STRAITENED
IS OUR FEEBLE NATURE WE HAVE NO CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THE BEGINNING OR
THE END OF OUR EXISTENCE
AT THIS MOMENT I AM MY OWN OR RATHER I AM
THINE THINE MY ADORED AND THE NEXT WE ARE PARTED SEVERED PERHAPS
FOR EVER NO CHARLOTTE NO HOW CAN I HOW CAN YOU BE ANNIHILATED WE
EXIST
WHAT IS ANNIHILATION A MERE WORD AN UNMEANING SOUND THAT FIXES
NO IMPRESSION ON THE MIND
DEAD CHARLOTTE LAID IN THE COLD EARTH IN
THE DARK AND NARROW GRAVE I HAD A FRIEND ONCE WHO WAS EVERYTHING TO ME
IN EARLY YOUTH
SHE DIED
I FOLLOWED HER HEARSE I STOOD BY HER GRAVE
WHEN THE COFFIN WAS LOWERED AND WHEN I HEARD THE CREAKING OF THE CORDS
AS THEY WERE LOOSENED AND DRAWN UP WHEN THE FIRST SHOVELFUL OF EARTH
WAS THROWN IN AND THE COFFIN RETURNED A HOLLOW SOUND WHICH GREW
FAINTER AND FAINTER TILL ALL WAS COMPLETELY COVERED OVER I THREW MYSELF
ON THE GROUND MY HEART WAS SMITTEN GRIEVED SHATTERED RENT BUT I
NEITHER KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED NOR WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN TO ME
DEATH
THE GRAVE I UNDERSTAND NOT THE WORDS FORGIVE OH FORGIVE ME
YESTERDAY AH THAT DAY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST OF MY LIFE THOU
ANGEL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY EXISTENCE I FELT RAPTURE GLOW WITHIN
MY INMOST SOUL
SHE LOVES SHE LOVES ME STILL BURNS UPON MY LIPS THE
SACRED FIRE THEY RECEIVED FROM THINE
NEW TORRENTS OF DELIGHT OVERWHELM
MY SOUL
FORGIVE ME OH FORGIVE
I KNEW THAT I WAS DEAR TO YOU I SAW IT IN YOUR FIRST ENTRANCING LOOK
KNEW IT BY THE FIRST PRESSURE OF YOUR HAND BUT WHEN I WAS ABSENT FROM
YOU WHEN I SAW ALBERT AT YOUR SIDE MY DOUBTS AND FEARS RETURNED
DO YOU REMEMBER THE FLOWERS YOU SENT ME WHEN AT THAT CROWDED
ASSEMBLY YOU COULD NEITHER SPEAK NOR EXTEND YOUR HAND TO ME HALF THE
NIGHT I WAS ON MY KNEES BEFORE THOSE FLOWERS AND I REGARDED THEM AS THE
PLEDGES OF YOUR LOVE BUT THOSE IMPRESSIONS GREW FAINTER AND WERE AT
LENGTH EFFACED
EVERYTHING PASSES AWAY BUT A WHOLE ETERNITY COULD NOT EXTINGUISH THE
LIVING FLAME WHICH WAS YESTERDAY KINDLED BY YOUR LIPS AND WHICH NOW
BURNS WITHIN ME
SHE LOVES ME THESE ARMS HAVE ENCIRCLED HER WAIST
THESE LIPS HAVE TREMBLED UPON HERS
SHE IS MINE YES CHARLOTTE YOU ARE
MINE FOR EVER
AND WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY SAYING ALBERT IS YOUR HUSBAND HE MAY BE SO
FOR THIS WORLD AND IN THIS WORLD IT IS A SIN TO LOVE YOU TO WISH
TO TEAR YOU FROM HIS EMBRACE
YES IT IS A CRIME AND I SUFFER THE
PUNISHMENT BUT I HAVE ENJOYED THE FULL DELIGHT OF MY SIN
I HAVE
INHALED A BALM THAT HAS REVIVED MY SOUL
FROM THIS HOUR YOU ARE MINE
YES CHARLOTTE YOU ARE MINE I GO BEFORE YOU
I GO TO MY FATHER AND TO
YOUR FATHER
I WILL POUR OUT MY SORROWS BEFORE HIM AND HE WILL GIVE ME
COMFORT TILL YOU ARRIVE
THEN WILL I FLY TO MEET YOU
I WILL CLAIM YOU
AND REMAIN YOUR ETERNAL EMBRACE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ALMIGHTY
I DO NOT DREAM I DO NOT RAVE
DRAWING NEARER TO THE GRAVE MY
PERCEPTIONS BECOME CLEARER
WE SHALL EXIST WE SHALL SEE EACH OTHER
AGAIN WE SHALL BEHOLD YOUR MOTHER I SHALL BEHOLD HER AND EXPOSE TO
HER MY INMOST HEART
YOUR MOTHER YOUR IMAGE
ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK WERTHER ASKED HIS SERVANT IF ALBERT HAD RETURNED
HE ANSWERED YES FOR HE HAD SEEN HIM PASS ON HORSEBACK UPON WHICH
WERTHER SENT HIM THE FOLLOWING NOTE UNSEALED
BE SO GOOD AS TO LEND ME YOUR PISTOLS FOR A JOURNEY
ADIEU
CHARLOTTE HAD SLEPT LITTLE DURING THE PAST NIGHT
ALL HER APPREHENSIONS
WERE REALISED IN A WAY THAT SHE COULD NEITHER FORESEE NOR AVOID
HER
BLOOD WAS BOILING IN HER VEINS AND A THOUSAND PAINFUL SENSATIONS RENT
HER PURE HEART
WAS IT THE ARDOUR OF WERTHER'S PASSIONATE EMBRACES THAT
SHE FELT WITHIN HER BOSOM WAS IT ANGER AT HIS DARING WAS IT THE SAD
COMPARISON OF HER PRESENT CONDITION WITH FORMER DAYS OF INNOCENCE
TRANQUILLITY AND SELF CONFIDENCE HOW COULD SHE APPROACH HER HUSBAND
AND CONFESS A SCENE WHICH SHE HAD NO REASON TO CONCEAL AND WHICH SHE
YET FELT NEVERTHELESS UNWILLING TO AVOW THEY HAD PRESERVED SO LONG A
SILENCE TOWARD EACH OTHER AND SHOULD SHE BE THE FIRST TO BREAK IT BY SO
UNEXPECTED A DISCOVERY SHE FEARED THAT THE MERE STATEMENT OF WERTHER'S
VISIT WOULD TROUBLE HIM AND HIS DISTRESS WOULD BE HEIGHTENED BY HER
PERFECT CANDOUR
SHE WISHED THAT HE COULD SEE HER IN HER TRUE LIGHT AND
JUDGE HER WITHOUT PREJUDICE BUT WAS SHE ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD READ HER
INMOST SOUL ON THE OTHER HAND COULD SHE DECEIVE A BEING TO WHOM ALL
HER THOUGHTS HAD EVER BEEN EXPOSED AS CLEARLY AS CRYSTAL AND FROM WHOM
NO SENTIMENT HAD EVER BEEN CONCEALED THESE REFLECTIONS MADE HER ANXIOUS
AND THOUGHTFUL
HER MIND STILL DWELT ON WERTHER WHO WAS NOW LOST TO
HER BUT WHOM SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO RESIGN AND FOR WHOM SHE
KNEW NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT DESPAIR IF SHE SHOULD BE LOST TO HIM FOR EVER
A RECOLLECTION OF THAT MYSTERIOUS ESTRANGEMENT WHICH HAD LATELY
SUBSISTED BETWEEN HERSELF AND ALBERT AND WHICH SHE COULD NEVER
THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND WAS NOW BEYOND MEASURE PAINFUL TO HER
EVEN THE
PRUDENT AND THE GOOD HAVE BEFORE NOW HESITATED TO EXPLAIN THEIR MUTUAL
DIFFERENCES AND HAVE DWELT IN SILENCE UPON THEIR IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES
UNTIL CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE BECOME SO ENTANGLED THAT IN THAT CRITICAL
JUNCTURE WHEN A CALM EXPLANATION WOULD HAVE SAVED ALL PARTIES AN
UNDERSTANDING WAS IMPOSSIBLE
AND THUS IF DOMESTIC CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN
EARLIER ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM IF LOVE AND KIND FORBEARANCE HAD
MUTUALLY ANIMATED AND EXPANDED THEIR HEARTS IT MIGHT NOT PERHAPS EVEN
YET HAVE BEEN TOO LATE TO SAVE OUR FRIEND
BUT WE MUST NOT FORGET ONE REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE
WE MAY OBSERVE FROM
THE CHARACTER OF WERTHER'S CORRESPONDENCE THAT HE HAD NEVER AFFECTED
TO CONCEAL HIS ANXIOUS DESIRE TO QUIT THIS WORLD
HE HAD OFTEN DISCUSSED
THE SUBJECT WITH ALBERT AND BETWEEN THE LATTER AND CHARLOTTE IT HAD
NOT UNFREQUENTLY FORMED A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION
ALBERT WAS SO OPPOSED
TO THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH AN ACTION THAT WITH A DEGREE OF IRRITATION
UNUSUAL IN HIM HE HAD MORE THAN ONCE GIVEN WERTHER TO UNDERSTAND THAT
HE DOUBTED THE SERIOUSNESS OF HIS THREATS AND NOT ONLY TURNED THEM INTO
RIDICULE BUT CAUSED CHARLOTTE TO SHARE HIS FEELINGS OF INCREDULITY
HER HEART WAS THUS TRANQUILLISED WHEN SHE FELT DISPOSED TO VIEW
THE MELANCHOLY SUBJECT IN A SERIOUS POINT OF VIEW THOUGH SHE NEVER
COMMUNICATED TO HER HUSBAND THE APPREHENSIONS SHE SOMETIMES EXPERIENCED
ALBERT UPON HIS RETURN WAS RECEIVED BY CHARLOTTE WITH ILL CONCEALED
EMBARRASSMENT
HE WAS HIMSELF OUT OF HUMOUR HIS BUSINESS WAS
UNFINISHED AND HE HAD JUST DISCOVERED THAT THE NEIGHBOURING OFFICIAL
WITH WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WAS AN OBSTINATE AND NARROW MINDED PERSONAGE
MANY THINGS HAD OCCURRED TO IRRITATE HIM
HE INQUIRED WHETHER ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED DURING HIS ABSENCE AND
CHARLOTTE HASTILY ANSWERED THAT WERTHER HAD BEEN THERE ON THE EVENING
PREVIOUSLY
HE THEN INQUIRED FOR HIS LETTERS AND WAS ANSWERED THAT
SEVERAL PACKAGES HAD BEEN LEFT IN HIS STUDY
HE THEREON RETIRED LEAVING
CHARLOTTE ALONE
THE PRESENCE OF THE BEING SHE LOVED AND HONOURED PRODUCED A NEW
IMPRESSION ON HER HEART
THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS GENEROSITY KINDNESS
AND AFFECTION HAD CALMED HER AGITATION A SECRET IMPULSE PROMPTED HER
TO FOLLOW HIM SHE TOOK HER WORK AND WENT TO HIS STUDY AS WAS OFTEN
HER CUSTOM
HE WAS BUSILY EMPLOYED OPENING AND READING HIS LETTERS
IT SEEMED AS IF THE CONTENTS OF SOME WERE DISAGREEABLE
SHE ASKED SOME
QUESTIONS HE GAVE SHORT ANSWERS AND SAT DOWN TO WRITE
SEVERAL HOURS PASSED IN THIS MANNER AND CHARLOTTE'S FEELINGS BECAME
MORE AND MORE MELANCHOLY
SHE FELT THE EXTREME DIFFICULTY OF EXPLAINING
TO HER HUSBAND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THE WEIGHT THAT LAY UPON HER
HEART AND HER DEPRESSION BECAME EVERY MOMENT GREATER IN PROPORTION AS
SHE ENDEAVOURED TO HIDE HER GRIEF AND TO CONCEAL HER TEARS
THE ARRIVAL OF WERTHER'S SERVANT OCCASIONED HER THE GREATEST
EMBARRASSMENT
HE GAVE ALBERT A NOTE WHICH THE LATTER COLDLY HANDED TO
HIS WIFE SAYING AT THE SAME TIME GIVE HIM THE PISTOLS
I WISH HIM
A PLEASANT JOURNEY HE ADDED TURNING TO THE SERVANT
THESE WORDS
FELL UPON CHARLOTTE LIKE A THUNDERSTROKE SHE ROSE FROM HER SEAT
HALF FAINTING AND UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT SHE DID
SHE WALKED MECHANICALLY
TOWARD THE WALL TOOK DOWN THE PISTOLS WITH A TREMBLING HAND SLOWLY
WIPED THE DUST FROM THEM AND WOULD HAVE DELAYED LONGER HAD NOT ALBERT
HASTENED HER MOVEMENTS BY AN IMPATIENT LOOK
SHE THEN DELIVERED THE
FATAL WEAPONS TO THE SERVANT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO UTTER A WORD
AS
SOON AS HE HAD DEPARTED SHE FOLDED UP HER WORK AND RETIRED AT ONCE
TO HER ROOM HER HEART OVERCOME WITH THE MOST FEARFUL FOREBODINGS
SHE
ANTICIPATED SOME DREADFUL CALAMITY
SHE WAS AT ONE MOMENT ON THE POINT
OF GOING TO HER HUSBAND THROWING HERSELF AT HIS FEET AND ACQUAINTING
HIM WITH ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING THAT SHE MIGHT
ACKNOWLEDGE HER FAULT AND EXPLAIN HER APPREHENSIONS THEN SHE SAW THAT
SUCH A STEP WOULD BE USELESS AS SHE WOULD CERTAINLY BE UNABLE TO INDUCE
ALBERT TO VISIT WERTHER
DINNER WAS SERVED AND A KIND FRIEND WHOM SHE
HAD PERSUADED TO REMAIN ASSISTED TO SUSTAIN THE CONVERSATION WHICH WAS
CARRIED ON BY A SORT OF COMPULSION TILL THE EVENTS OF THE MORNING WERE
FORGOTTEN
WHEN THE SERVANT BROUGHT THE PISTOLS TO WERTHER THE LATTER RECEIVED
THEM WITH TRANSPORTS OF DELIGHT UPON HEARING THAT CHARLOTTE HAD GIVEN
THEM TO HIM WITH HER OWN HAND
HE ATE SOME BREAD DRANK SOME WINE SENT
HIS SERVANT TO DINNER AND THEN SAT DOWN TO WRITE AS FOLLOWS
THEY HAVE BEEN IN YOUR HANDS YOU WIPED THE DUST FROM THEM
I KISS THEM
A THOUSAND TIMES YOU HAVE TOUCHED THEM
YES HEAVEN FAVOURS MY DESIGN
AND YOU CHARLOTTE PROVIDE ME WITH THE FATAL INSTRUMENTS
IT WAS MY
DESIRE TO RECEIVE MY DEATH FROM YOUR HANDS AND MY WISH IS GRATIFIED
I HAVE MADE INQUIRIES OF MY SERVANT
YOU TREMBLED WHEN YOU GAVE HIM THE
PISTOLS BUT YOU BADE ME NO ADIEU
WRETCHED WRETCHED THAT I AM NOT ONE
FAREWELL HOW COULD YOU SHUT YOUR HEART AGAINST ME IN THAT HOUR WHICH
MAKES YOU MINE FOR EVER CHARLOTTE AGES CANNOT EFFACE THE IMPRESSION I
FEEL YOU CANNOT HATE THE MAN WHO SO PASSIONATELY LOVES YOU
AFTER DINNER HE CALLED HIS SERVANT DESIRED HIM TO FINISH THE PACKING
UP DESTROYED MANY PAPERS AND THEN WENT OUT TO PAY SOME TRIFLING DEBTS
HE SOON RETURNED HOME THEN WENT OUT AGAIN NOTWITHSTANDING THE RAIN
WALKED FOR SOME TIME IN THE COUNT'S GARDEN AND AFTERWARD PROCEEDED
FARTHER INTO THE COUNTRY
TOWARD EVENING HE CAME BACK ONCE MORE AND
RESUMED HIS WRITING
WILHELM I HAVE FOR THE LAST TIME BEHELD THE MOUNTAINS THE FORESTS
AND THE SKY
FAREWELL AND YOU MY DEAREST MOTHER FORGIVE ME CONSOLE
HER WILHELM
GOD BLESS YOU I HAVE SETTLED ALL MY AFFAIRS FAREWELL WE
SHALL MEET AGAIN AND BE HAPPIER THAN EVER
I HAVE REQUITED YOU BADLY ALBERT BUT YOU WILL FORGIVE ME
I HAVE
DISTURBED THE PEACE OF YOUR HOME
I HAVE SOWED DISTRUST BETWEEN YOU
FAREWELL I WILL END ALL THIS WRETCHEDNESS
AND OH THAT MY DEATH
MAY RENDER YOU HAPPY ALBERT ALBERT MAKE THAT ANGEL HAPPY AND THE
BLESSING OF HEAVEN BE UPON YOU
HE SPENT THE REST OF THE EVENING IN ARRANGING HIS PAPERS HE TORE AND
BURNED A GREAT MANY OTHERS HE SEALED UP AND DIRECTED TO WILHELM
THEY CONTAINED SOME DETACHED THOUGHTS AND MAXIMS SOME OF WHICH I HAVE
PERUSED
AT TEN O'CLOCK HE ORDERED HIS FIRE TO BE MADE UP AND A BOTTLE
OF WINE TO BE BROUGHT TO HIM
HE THEN DISMISSED HIS SERVANT WHOSE ROOM
AS WELL AS THE APARTMENTS OF THE REST OF THE FAMILY WAS SITUATED IN
ANOTHER PART OF THE HOUSE
THE SERVANT LAY DOWN WITHOUT UNDRESSING THAT
HE MIGHT BE THE SOONER READY FOR HIS JOURNEY IN THE MORNING HIS MASTER
HAVING INFORMED HIM THAT THE POST HORSES WOULD BE AT THE DOOR BEFORE SIX
O'CLOCK
PAST ELEVEN O'CLOCK ALL IS SILENT AROUND ME AND MY SOUL IS CALM
I
THANK THEE O GOD THAT THOU BESTOWEST STRENGTH AND COURAGE UPON ME IN
THESE LAST MOMENTS I APPROACH THE WINDOW MY DEAREST OF FRIENDS AND
THROUGH THE CLOUDS WHICH ARE AT THIS MOMENT DRIVEN RAPIDLY ALONG BY THE
IMPETUOUS WINDS I BEHOLD THE STARS WHICH ILLUMINE THE ETERNAL HEAVENS
NO YOU WILL NOT FALL CELESTIAL BODIES THE HAND OF THE ALMIGHTY
SUPPORTS BOTH YOU AND ME I HAVE LOOKED FOR THE LAST TIME UPON THE
CONSTELLATION OF THE GREATER BEAR IT IS MY FAVOURITE STAR FOR WHEN
I BADE YOU FAREWELL AT NIGHT CHARLOTTE AND TURNED MY STEPS FROM YOUR
DOOR IT ALWAYS SHONE UPON ME
WITH WHAT RAPTURE HAVE I AT TIMES BEHELD
IT HOW OFTEN HAVE I IMPLORED IT WITH UPLIFTED HANDS TO WITNESS MY
FELICITY AND EVEN STILL BUT WHAT OBJECT IS THERE CHARLOTTE WHICH
FAILS TO SUMMON UP YOUR IMAGE BEFORE ME DO YOU NOT SURROUND ME ON ALL
SIDES AND HAVE I NOT LIKE A CHILD TREASURED UP EVERY TRIFLE WHICH YOU
HAVE CONSECRATED BY YOUR TOUCH
YOUR PROFILE WHICH WAS SO DEAR TO ME I RETURN TO YOU AND I PRAY
YOU TO PRESERVE IT
THOUSANDS OF KISSES HAVE I IMPRINTED UPON IT AND A
THOUSAND TIMES HAS IT GLADDENED MY HEART ON DEPARTING FROM AND RETURNING
TO MY HOME
I HAVE IMPLORED YOUR FATHER TO PROTECT MY REMAINS
AT THE CORNER OF THE
CHURCHYARD LOOKING TOWARD THE FIELDS THERE ARE TWO LIME TREES THERE
I WISH TO LIE
YOUR FATHER CAN AND DOUBTLESS WILL DO THIS MUCH FOR HIS
FRIEND
IMPLORE IT OF HIM
BUT PERHAPS PIOUS CHRISTIANS WILL NOT CHOOSE
THAT THEIR BODIES SHOULD BE BURIED NEAR THE CORPSE OF A POOR UNHAPPY
WRETCH LIKE ME
THEN LET ME BE LAID IN SOME REMOTE VALLEY OR NEAR THE
HIGHWAY WHERE THE PRIEST AND LEVITE MAY BLESS THEMSELVES AS THEY PASS
BY MY TOMB WHILST THE SAMARITAN WILL SHED A TEAR FOR MY FATE
SEE CHARLOTTE I DO NOT SHUDDER TO TAKE THE COLD AND FATAL CUP FROM
WHICH I SHALL DRINK THE DRAUGHT OF DEATH
YOUR HAND PRESENTS IT TO ME
AND I DO NOT TREMBLE
ALL ALL IS NOW CONCLUDED THE WISHES AND THE
HOPES OF MY EXISTENCE ARE FULFILLED
WITH COLD UNFLINCHING HAND I KNOCK
AT THE BRAZEN PORTALS OF DEATH
OH THAT I HAD ENJOYED THE BLISS OF
DYING FOR YOU HOW GLADLY WOULD I HAVE SACRIFICED MYSELF FOR YOU
CHARLOTTE AND COULD I BUT RESTORE PEACE AND JOY TO YOUR BOSOM WITH
WHAT RESOLUTION WITH WHAT JOY WOULD I NOT MEET MY FATE BUT IT IS THE
LOT OF ONLY A CHOSEN FEW TO SHED THEIR BLOOD FOR THEIR FRIENDS AND BY
THEIR DEATH TO AUGMENT A THOUSAND TIMES THE HAPPINESS OF THOSE BY WHOM
THEY ARE BELOVED
I WISH CHARLOTTE TO BE BURIED IN THE DRESS I WEAR AT PRESENT IT HAS
BEEN RENDERED SACRED BY YOUR TOUCH
I HAVE BEGGED THIS FAVOUR OF YOUR
FATHER
MY SPIRIT SOARS ABOVE MY SEPULCHRE
I DO NOT WISH MY POCKETS TO
BE SEARCHED
THE KNOT OF PINK RIBBON WHICH YOU WORE ON YOUR BOSOM
THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU SURROUNDED BY THE CHILDREN OH KISS THEM A
THOUSAND TIMES FOR ME AND TELL THEM THE FATE OF THEIR UNHAPPY FRIEND I
THINK I SEE THEM PLAYING AROUND ME
THE DEAR CHILDREN HOW WARMLY HAVE
I BEEN ATTACHED TO YOU CHARLOTTE SINCE THE FIRST HOUR I SAW YOU HOW
IMPOSSIBLE HAVE I FOUND IT TO LEAVE YOU
THIS RIBBON MUST BE BURIED
WITH ME IT WAS A PRESENT FROM YOU ON MY BIRTHDAY
HOW CONFUSED IT ALL
APPEARS LITTLE DID I THEN THINK THAT I SHOULD JOURNEY THIS ROAD
BUT
PEACE I PRAY YOU PEACE
THEY ARE LOADED THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE
I SAY AMEN
CHARLOTTE
CHARLOTTE FAREWELL FAREWELL
A NEIGHBOUR SAW THE FLASH AND HEARD THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BUT AS
EVERYTHING REMAINED QUIET HE THOUGHT NO MORE OF IT
IN THE MORNING AT SIX O'CLOCK THE SERVANT WENT INTO WERTHER'S ROOM
WITH A CANDLE
HE FOUND HIS MASTER STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR WELTERING
IN HIS BLOOD AND THE PISTOLS AT HIS SIDE
HE CALLED HE TOOK HIM IN
HIS ARMS BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER
LIFE WAS NOT YET QUITE EXTINCT
THE
SERVANT RAN FOR A SURGEON AND THEN WENT TO FETCH ALBERT
CHARLOTTE
HEARD THE RINGING OF THE BELL A COLD SHUDDER SEIZED HER
SHE WAKENED
HER HUSBAND AND THEY BOTH ROSE
THE SERVANT BATHED IN TEARS FALTERED
FORTH THE DREADFUL NEWS
CHARLOTTE FELL SENSELESS AT ALBERT'S FEET
WHEN THE SURGEON CAME TO THE UNFORTUNATE WERTHER HE WAS STILL LYING
ON THE FLOOR AND HIS PULSE BEAT BUT HIS LIMBS WERE COLD
THE BULLET
ENTERING THE FOREHEAD OVER THE RIGHT EYE HAD PENETRATED THE SKULL
A
VEIN WAS OPENED IN HIS RIGHT ARM THE BLOOD CAME AND HE STILL CONTINUED
TO BREATHE
FROM THE BLOOD WHICH FLOWED FROM THE CHAIR IT COULD BE INFERRED THAT HE
HAD COMMITTED THE RASH ACT SITTING AT HIS BUREAU AND THAT HE AFTERWARD
FELL UPON THE FLOOR
HE WAS FOUND LYING ON HIS BACK NEAR THE WINDOW
HE
WAS IN FULL DRESS COSTUME
THE HOUSE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND THE WHOLE TOWN WERE IMMEDIATELY IN
COMMOTION
ALBERT ARRIVED
THEY HAD LAID WERTHER ON THE BED HIS HEAD
WAS BOUND UP AND THE PALENESS OF DEATH WAS UPON HIS FACE
HIS LIMBS
WERE MOTIONLESS BUT HE STILL BREATHED AT ONE TIME STRONGLY THEN
WEAKER HIS DEATH WAS MOMENTLY EXPECTED
HE HAD DRUNK ONLY ONE GLASS OF THE WINE
EMILIA GALOTTI LAY OPEN UPON
HIS BUREAU
I SHALL SAY NOTHING OF ALBERT'S DISTRESS OR OF CHARLOTTE'S GRIEF
THE OLD STEWARD HASTENED TO THE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY UPON HEARING THE NEWS
HE EMBRACED HIS DYING FRIEND AMID A FLOOD OF TEARS
HIS ELDEST BOYS
SOON FOLLOWED HIM ON FOOT
IN SPEECHLESS SORROW THEY THREW THEMSELVES ON
THEIR KNEES BY THE BEDSIDE AND KISSED HIS HANDS AND FACE
THE ELDEST
WHO WAS HIS FAVOURITE HUNG OVER HIM TILL HE EXPIRED AND EVEN THEN HE
WAS REMOVED BY FORCE
AT TWELVE O'CLOCK WERTHER BREATHED HIS LAST
THE
PRESENCE OF THE STEWARD AND THE PRECAUTIONS HE HAD ADOPTED PREVENTED
A DISTURBANCE AND THAT NIGHT AT THE HOUR OF ELEVEN HE CAUSED THE BODY
TO BE INTERRED IN THE PLACE WHICH WERTHER HAD SELECTED FOR HIMSELF
THE STEWARD AND HIS SONS FOLLOWED THE CORPSE TO THE GRAVE
ALBERT WAS
UNABLE TO ACCOMPANY THEM
CHARLOTTE'S LIFE WAS DESPAIRED OF
THE BODY
WAS CARRIED BY LABOURERS
NO PRIEST ATTENDED
