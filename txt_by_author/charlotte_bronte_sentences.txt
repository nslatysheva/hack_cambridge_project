CHAPTER I
LEVITICAL
OF LATE YEARS AN ABUNDANT SHOWER OF CURATES HAS FALLEN UPON THE NORTH OF
ENGLAND THEY LIE VERY THICK ON THE HILLS EVERY PARISH HAS ONE OR MORE
OF THEM THEY ARE YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE VERY ACTIVE AND OUGHT TO BE DOING
A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD
BUT NOT OF LATE YEARS ARE WE ABOUT TO SPEAK WE
ARE GOING BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY LATE YEARS PRESENT
YEARS ARE DUSTY SUNBURNT HOT ARID WE WILL EVADE THE NOON FORGET IT
IN SIESTA PASS THE MIDDAY IN SLUMBER AND DREAM OF DAWN
IF YOU THINK FROM THIS PRELUDE THAT ANYTHING LIKE A ROMANCE IS
PREPARING FOR YOU READER YOU NEVER WERE MORE MISTAKEN
DO YOU
ANTICIPATE SENTIMENT AND POETRY AND REVERIE DO YOU EXPECT PASSION
AND STIMULUS AND MELODRAMA CALM YOUR EXPECTATIONS REDUCE THEM TO A
LOWLY STANDARD
SOMETHING REAL COOL AND SOLID LIES BEFORE YOU
SOMETHING UNROMANTIC AS MONDAY MORNING WHEN ALL WHO HAVE WORK WAKE WITH
THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THEY MUST RISE AND BETAKE THEMSELVES THERETO
IT
IS NOT POSITIVELY AFFIRMED THAT YOU SHALL NOT HAVE A TASTE OF THE
EXCITING PERHAPS TOWARDS THE MIDDLE AND CLOSE OF THE MEAL BUT IT IS
RESOLVED THAT THE FIRST DISH SET UPON THE TABLE SHALL BE ONE THAT A
CATHOLIC AY EVEN AN ANGLO CATHOLIC MIGHT EAT ON GOOD FRIDAY IN
PASSION WEEK IT SHALL BE COLD LENTILS AND VINEGAR WITHOUT OIL IT SHALL
BE UNLEAVENED BREAD WITH BITTER HERBS AND NO ROAST LAMB
OF LATE YEARS I SAY AN ABUNDANT SHOWER OF CURATES HAS FALLEN UPON THE
NORTH OF ENGLAND BUT IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED ELEVEN TWELVE THAT AFFLUENT
RAIN HAD NOT DESCENDED
CURATES WERE SCARCE THEN THERE WAS NO PASTORAL
AID NO ADDITIONAL CURATES' SOCIETY TO STRETCH A HELPING HAND TO
WORN OUT OLD RECTORS AND INCUMBENTS AND GIVE THEM THE WHEREWITHAL TO
PAY A VIGOROUS YOUNG COLLEAGUE FROM OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE
THE PRESENT
SUCCESSORS OF THE APOSTLES DISCIPLES OF DR
PUSEY AND TOOLS OF THE
PROPAGANDA WERE AT THAT TIME BEING HATCHED UNDER CRADLE BLANKETS OR
UNDERGOING REGENERATION BY NURSERY BAPTISM IN WASH HAND BASINS
YOU
COULD NOT HAVE GUESSED BY LOOKING AT ANY ONE OF THEM THAT THE
ITALIAN IRONED DOUBLE FRILLS OF ITS NET CAP SURROUNDED THE BROWS OF A
PREORDAINED SPECIALLY SANCTIFIED SUCCESSOR OF ST
PAUL ST
PETER OR
ST
JOHN NOR COULD YOU HAVE FORESEEN IN THE FOLDS OF ITS LONG
NIGHT GOWN THE WHITE SURPLICE IN WHICH IT WAS HEREAFTER CRUELLY TO
EXERCISE THE SOULS OF ITS PARISHIONERS AND STRANGELY TO NONPLUS ITS
OLD FASHIONED VICAR BY FLOURISHING ALOFT IN A PULPIT THE SHIRT LIKE
RAIMENT WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE WAVED HIGHER THAN THE READING DESK
YET EVEN IN THOSE DAYS OF SCARCITY THERE WERE CURATES THE PRECIOUS
PLANT WAS RARE BUT IT MIGHT BE FOUND
A CERTAIN FAVOURED DISTRICT IN
THE WEST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE COULD BOAST THREE RODS OF AARON BLOSSOMING
WITHIN A CIRCUIT OF TWENTY MILES
YOU SHALL SEE THEM READER
STEP INTO
THIS NEAT GARDEN HOUSE ON THE SKIRTS OF WHINBURY WALK FORWARD INTO THE
LITTLE PARLOUR
THERE THEY ARE AT DINNER
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE THEM TO
YOU MR
DONNE CURATE OF WHINBURY MR
MALONE CURATE OF BRIARFIELD
MR
SWEETING CURATE OF NUNNELY
THESE ARE MR
DONNE'S LODGINGS BEING
THE HABITATION OF ONE JOHN GALE A SMALL CLOTHIER
MR
DONNE HAS KINDLY
INVITED HIS BRETHREN TO REGALE WITH HIM
YOU AND I WILL JOIN THE PARTY
SEE WHAT IS TO BE SEEN AND HEAR WHAT IS TO BE HEARD
AT PRESENT
HOWEVER THEY ARE ONLY EATING AND WHILE THEY EAT WE WILL TALK ASIDE
THESE GENTLEMEN ARE IN THE BLOOM OF YOUTH THEY POSSESS ALL THE ACTIVITY
OF THAT INTERESTING AGE AN ACTIVITY WHICH THEIR MOPING OLD VICARS WOULD
FAIN TURN INTO THE CHANNEL OF THEIR PASTORAL DUTIES OFTEN EXPRESSING A
WISH TO SEE IT EXPENDED IN A DILIGENT SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE SCHOOLS
AND IN FREQUENT VISITS TO THE SICK OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PARISHES
BUT THE
YOUTHFUL LEVITES FEEL THIS TO BE DULL WORK THEY PREFER LAVISHING THEIR
ENERGIES ON A COURSE OF PROCEEDING WHICH THOUGH TO OTHER EYES IT APPEAR
MORE HEAVY WITH ENNUI MORE CURSED WITH MONOTONY THAN THE TOIL OF
THE WEAVER AT HIS LOOM SEEMS TO YIELD THEM AN UNFAILING SUPPLY OF
ENJOYMENT AND OCCUPATION
I ALLUDE TO A RUSHING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONGST THEMSELVES TO AND
FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE LODGINGS NOT A ROUND BUT A TRIANGLE OF VISITS
WHICH THEY KEEP UP ALL THE YEAR THROUGH IN WINTER SPRING SUMMER AND
AUTUMN
SEASON AND WEATHER MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WITH UNINTELLIGIBLE ZEAL
THEY DARE SNOW AND HAIL WIND AND RAIN MIRE AND DUST TO GO AND DINE
OR DRINK TEA OR SUP WITH EACH OTHER
WHAT ATTRACTS THEM IT WOULD BE
DIFFICULT TO SAY
IT IS NOT FRIENDSHIP FOR WHENEVER THEY MEET THEY
QUARREL
IT IS NOT RELIGION THE THING IS NEVER NAMED AMONGST THEM
THEOLOGY THEY MAY DISCUSS OCCASIONALLY BUT PIETY NEVER
IT IS NOT THE
LOVE OF EATING AND DRINKING EACH MIGHT HAVE AS GOOD A JOINT AND
PUDDING TEA AS POTENT AND TOAST AS SUCCULENT AT HIS OWN LODGINGS AS
IS SERVED TO HIM AT HIS BROTHER'S
MRS
GALE MRS
HOGG AND MRS
WHIPP THEIR RESPECTIVE LANDLADIES AFFIRM THAT IT IS JUST FOR NAUGHT
ELSE BUT TO GIVE FOLK TROUBLE BY FOLK THE GOOD LADIES OF COURSE MEAN
THEMSELVES FOR INDEED THEY ARE KEPT IN A CONTINUAL FRY BY THIS SYSTEM
OF MUTUAL INVASION
MR
DONNE AND HIS GUESTS AS I HAVE SAID ARE AT DINNER MRS
GALE WAITS
ON THEM BUT A SPARK OF THE HOT KITCHEN FIRE IS IN HER EYE
SHE
CONSIDERS THAT THE PRIVILEGE OF INVITING A FRIEND TO A MEAL
OCCASIONALLY WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CHARGE A PRIVILEGE INCLUDED IN THE
TERMS ON WHICH SHE LETS HER LODGINGS HAS BEEN QUITE SUFFICIENTLY
EXERCISED OF LATE
THE PRESENT WEEK IS YET BUT AT THURSDAY AND ON
MONDAY MR
MALONE THE CURATE OF BRIARFIELD CAME TO BREAKFAST AND
STAYED DINNER ON TUESDAY MR
MALONE AND MR
SWEETING OF NUNNELY CAME TO
TEA REMAINED TO SUPPER OCCUPIED THE SPARE BED AND FAVOURED HER WITH
THEIR COMPANY TO BREAKFAST ON WEDNESDAY MORNING NOW ON THURSDAY THEY
ARE BOTH HERE AT DINNER AND SHE IS ALMOST CERTAIN THEY WILL STAY ALL
NIGHT
C'EN EST TROP SHE WOULD SAY IF SHE COULD SPEAK FRENCH
MR
SWEETING IS MINCING THE SLICE OF ROAST BEEF ON HIS PLATE AND
COMPLAINING THAT IT IS VERY TOUGH MR
DONNE SAYS THE BEER IS FLAT
AY
THAT IS THE WORST OF IT IF THEY WOULD ONLY BE CIVIL MRS
GALE WOULDN'T
MIND IT SO MUCH IF THEY WOULD ONLY SEEM SATISFIED WITH WHAT THEY GET
SHE WOULDN'T CARE BUT THESE YOUNG PARSONS IS SO HIGH AND SO SCORNFUL
THEY SET EVERYBODY BENEATH THEIR 'FIT THEY TREAT HER WITH LESS THAN
CIVILITY JUST BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T KEEP A SERVANT BUT DOES THE WORK OF
THE HOUSE HERSELF AS HER MOTHER DID AFORE HER THEN THEY ARE ALWAYS
SPEAKING AGAINST YORKSHIRE WAYS AND YORKSHIRE FOLK AND BY THAT VERY
TOKEN MRS
GALE DOES NOT BELIEVE ONE OF THEM TO BE A REAL GENTLEMAN OR
COME OF GENTLE KIN
THE OLD PARSONS IS WORTH THE WHOLE LUMP OF COLLEGE
LADS THEY KNOW WHAT BELONGS TO GOOD MANNERS AND IS KIND TO HIGH AND
LOW
MORE BREAD CRIES MR
MALONE IN A TONE WHICH THOUGH PROLONGED BUT TO
UTTER TWO SYLLABLES PROCLAIMS HIM AT ONCE A NATIVE OF THE LAND OF
SHAMROCKS AND POTATOES
MRS
GALE HATES MR
MALONE MORE THAN EITHER OF
THE OTHER TWO BUT SHE FEARS HIM ALSO FOR HE IS A TALL STRONGLY BUILT
PERSONAGE WITH REAL IRISH LEGS AND ARMS AND A FACE AS GENUINELY
NATIONAL NOT THE MILESIAN FACE NOT DANIEL O'CONNELL'S STYLE BUT THE
HIGH FEATURED NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN SORT OF VISAGE WHICH BELONGS TO A
CERTAIN CLASS OF THE IRISH GENTRY AND HAS A PETRIFIED AND PROUD LOOK
BETTER SUITED TO THE OWNER OF AN ESTATE OF SLAVES THAN TO THE LANDLORD
OF A FREE PEASANTRY
MR
MALONE'S FATHER TERMED HIMSELF A GENTLEMAN HE
WAS POOR AND IN DEBT AND BESOTTEDLY ARROGANT AND HIS SON WAS LIKE HIM
MRS
GALE OFFERED THE LOAF
CUT IT WOMAN SAID HER GUEST AND THE WOMAN CUT IT ACCORDINGLY
HAD
SHE FOLLOWED HER INCLINATIONS SHE WOULD HAVE CUT THE PARSON ALSO HER
YORKSHIRE SOUL REVOLTED ABSOLUTELY FROM HIS MANNER OF COMMAND
THE CURATES HAD GOOD APPETITES AND THOUGH THE BEEF WAS TOUGH THEY
ATE A GREAT DEAL OF IT
THEY SWALLOWED TOO A TOLERABLE ALLOWANCE OF
THE FLAT BEER WHILE A DISH OF YORKSHIRE PUDDING AND TWO TUREENS OF
VEGETABLES DISAPPEARED LIKE LEAVES BEFORE LOCUSTS
THE CHEESE TOO
RECEIVED DISTINGUISHED MARKS OF THEIR ATTENTION AND A SPICE CAKE
WHICH FOLLOWED BY WAY OF DESSERT VANISHED LIKE A VISION AND WAS NO
MORE FOUND
ITS ELEGY WAS CHANTED IN THE KITCHEN BY ABRAHAM MRS
GALE'S
SON AND HEIR A YOUTH OF SIX SUMMERS HE HAD RECKONED UPON THE REVERSION
THEREOF AND WHEN HIS MOTHER BROUGHT DOWN THE EMPTY PLATTER HE LIFTED
UP HIS VOICE AND WEPT SORE
THE CURATES MEANTIME SAT AND SIPPED THEIR WINE A LIQUOR OF
UNPRETENDING VINTAGE MODERATELY ENJOYED
MR
MALONE INDEED WOULD MUCH
RATHER HAVE HAD WHISKY BUT MR
DONNE BEING AN ENGLISHMAN DID NOT KEEP
THE BEVERAGE
WHILE THEY SIPPED THEY ARGUED NOT ON POLITICS NOR ON
PHILOSOPHY NOR ON LITERATURE THESE TOPICS WERE NOW AS EVER TOTALLY
WITHOUT INTEREST FOR THEM NOT EVEN ON THEOLOGY PRACTICAL OR DOCTRINAL
BUT ON MINUTE POINTS OF ECCLESIASTICAL DISCIPLINE FRIVOLITIES WHICH
SEEMED EMPTY AS BUBBLES TO ALL SAVE THEMSELVES
MR
MALONE WHO
CONTRIVED TO SECURE TWO GLASSES OF WINE WHEN HIS BRETHREN CONTENTED
THEMSELVES WITH ONE WAXED BY DEGREES HILARIOUS AFTER HIS FASHION THAT
IS HE GREW A LITTLE INSOLENT SAID RUDE THINGS IN A HECTORING TONE AND
LAUGHED CLAMOROUSLY AT HIS OWN BRILLIANCY
EACH OF HIS COMPANIONS BECAME IN TURN HIS BUTT
MALONE HAD A STOCK OF
JOKES AT THEIR SERVICE WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SERVE OUT REGULARLY
ON CONVIVIAL OCCASIONS LIKE THE PRESENT SELDOM VARYING HIS WIT FOR
WHICH INDEED THERE WAS NO NECESSITY AS HE NEVER APPEARED TO CONSIDER
HIMSELF MONOTONOUS AND DID NOT AT ALL CARE WHAT OTHERS THOUGHT
MR
DONNE HE FAVOURED WITH HINTS ABOUT HIS EXTREME MEAGRENESS ALLUSIONS TO
HIS TURNED UP NOSE CUTTING SARCASMS ON A CERTAIN THREADBARE CHOCOLATE
SURTOUT WHICH THAT GENTLEMAN WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPORT WHENEVER IT RAINED
OR SEEMED LIKELY TO RAIN AND CRITICISMS ON A CHOICE SET OF COCKNEY
PHRASES AND MODES OF PRONUNCIATION MR
DONNE'S OWN PROPERTY AND
CERTAINLY DESERVING OF REMARK FOR THE ELEGANCE AND FINISH THEY
COMMUNICATED TO HIS STYLE
MR
SWEETING WAS BANTERED ABOUT HIS STATURE HE WAS A LITTLE MAN A MERE
BOY IN HEIGHT AND BREADTH COMPARED WITH THE ATHLETIC MALONE RALLIED ON
HIS MUSICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS HE PLAYED THE FLUTE AND SANG HYMNS LIKE A
SERAPH SOME YOUNG LADIES OF HIS PARISH THOUGHT SNEERED AT AS THE
LADIES' PET TEASED ABOUT HIS MAMMA AND SISTERS FOR WHOM POOR MR
SWEETING HAD SOME LINGERING REGARD AND OF WHOM HE WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH
NOW AND THEN TO SPEAK IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PRIESTLY PADDY FROM WHOSE
ANATOMY THE BOWELS OF NATURAL AFFECTION HAD SOMEHOW BEEN OMITTED
THE VICTIMS MET THESE ATTACKS EACH IN HIS OWN WAY MR
DONNE WITH A
STILTED SELF COMPLACENCY AND HALF SULLEN PHLEGM THE SOLE PROPS OF HIS
OTHERWISE SOMEWHAT RICKETY DIGNITY MR
SWEETING WITH THE INDIFFERENCE
OF A LIGHT EASY DISPOSITION WHICH NEVER PROFESSED TO HAVE ANY DIGNITY
TO MAINTAIN
WHEN MALONE'S RAILLERY BECAME RATHER TOO OFFENSIVE WHICH IT SOON DID
THEY JOINED IN AN ATTEMPT TO TURN THE TABLES ON HIM BY ASKING HIM HOW
MANY BOYS HAD SHOUTED IRISH PETER AFTER HIM AS HE CAME ALONG THE ROAD
THAT DAY MALONE'S NAME WAS PETER THE REV
PETER AUGUSTUS MALONE
REQUESTING TO BE INFORMED WHETHER IT WAS THE MODE IN IRELAND FOR
CLERGYMEN TO CARRY LOADED PISTOLS IN THEIR POCKETS AND A SHILLELAH IN
THEIR HANDS WHEN THEY MADE PASTORAL VISITS INQUIRING THE SIGNIFICATION
OF SUCH WORDS AS VELE FIRRUM HELLUM STORRUM SO MR
MALONE INVARIABLY
PRONOUNCED VEIL FIRM HELM STORM AND EMPLOYING SUCH OTHER METHODS OF
RETALIATION AS THE INNATE REFINEMENT OF THEIR MINDS SUGGESTED
THIS OF COURSE WOULD NOT DO
MALONE BEING NEITHER GOOD NATURED NOR
PHLEGMATIC WAS PRESENTLY IN A TOWERING PASSION
HE VOCIFERATED
GESTICULATED DONNE AND SWEETING LAUGHED
HE REVILED THEM AS SAXONS AND
SNOBS AT THE VERY TOP PITCH OF HIS HIGH CELTIC VOICE THEY TAUNTED HIM
WITH BEING THE NATIVE OF A CONQUERED LAND
HE MENACED REBELLION IN THE
NAME OF HIS COUNTHRY VENTED BITTER HATRED AGAINST ENGLISH RULE THEY
SPOKE OF RAGS BEGGARY AND PESTILENCE
THE LITTLE PARLOUR WAS IN AN
UPROAR YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A DUEL MUST FOLLOW SUCH VIRULENT ABUSE
IT SEEMED A WONDER THAT MR
AND MRS
GALE DID NOT TAKE ALARM AT THE
NOISE AND SEND FOR A CONSTABLE TO KEEP THE PEACE
BUT THEY WERE
ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH DEMONSTRATIONS THEY WELL KNEW THAT THE CURATES NEVER
DINED OR TOOK TEA TOGETHER WITHOUT A LITTLE EXERCISE OF THE SORT AND
WERE QUITE EASY AS TO CONSEQUENCES KNOWING THAT THESE CLERICAL QUARRELS
WERE AS HARMLESS AS THEY WERE NOISY THAT THEY RESULTED IN NOTHING AND
THAT ON WHATEVER TERMS THE CURATES MIGHT PART TO NIGHT THEY WOULD BE
SURE TO MEET THE BEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD TO MORROW MORNING
AS THE WORTHY PAIR WERE SITTING BY THEIR KITCHEN FIRE LISTENING TO THE
REPEATED AND SONOROUS CONTACT OF MALONE'S FIST WITH THE MAHOGANY PLANE
OF THE PARLOUR TABLE AND TO THE CONSEQUENT START AND JINGLE OF
DECANTERS AND GLASSES FOLLOWING EACH ASSAULT TO THE MOCKING LAUGHTER OF
THE ALLIED ENGLISH DISPUTANTS AND THE STUTTERING DECLAMATION OF THE
ISOLATED HIBERNIAN AS THEY THUS SAT A FOOT WAS HEARD ON THE OUTER
DOOR STEP AND THE KNOCKER QUIVERED TO A SHARP APPEAL
MR
GALE WENT AND OPENED
WHOM HAVE YOU UPSTAIRS IN THE PARLOUR ASKED A VOICE A RATHER
REMARKABLE VOICE NASAL IN TONE ABRUPT IN UTTERANCE
O MR
HELSTONE IS IT YOU SIR I COULD HARDLY SEE YOU FOR THE
DARKNESS IT IS SO SOON DARK NOW
WILL YOU WALK IN SIR
I WANT TO KNOW FIRST WHETHER IT IS WORTH MY WHILE WALKING IN
WHOM HAVE
YOU UPSTAIRS
THE CURATES SIR
WHAT ALL OF THEM
YES SIR
BEEN DINING HERE
YES SIR
THAT WILL DO
WITH THESE WORDS A PERSON ENTERED A MIDDLE AGED MAN IN BLACK
HE
WALKED STRAIGHT ACROSS THE KITCHEN TO AN INNER DOOR OPENED IT INCLINED
HIS HEAD FORWARD AND STOOD LISTENING
THERE WAS SOMETHING TO LISTEN TO
FOR THE NOISE ABOVE WAS JUST THEN LOUDER THAN EVER
HEY HE EJACULATED TO HIMSELF THEN TURNING TO MR
GALE HAVE YOU
OFTEN THIS SORT OF WORK
MR
GALE HAD BEEN A CHURCHWARDEN AND WAS INDULGENT TO THE CLERGY
THEY'RE YOUNG YOU KNOW SIR THEY'RE YOUNG SAID HE DEPRECATINGLY
YOUNG THEY WANT CANING
BAD BOYS BAD BOYS AND IF YOU WERE A
DISSENTER JOHN GALE INSTEAD OF BEING A GOOD CHURCHMAN THEY'D DO THE
LIKE THEY'D EXPOSE THEMSELVES BUT I'LL
BY WAY OF FINISH TO THIS SENTENCE HE PASSED THROUGH THE INNER DOOR
DREW IT AFTER HIM AND MOUNTED THE STAIR
AGAIN HE LISTENED A FEW
MINUTES WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE UPPER ROOM
MAKING ENTRANCE WITHOUT
WARNING HE STOOD BEFORE THE CURATES
AND THEY WERE SILENT THEY WERE TRANSFIXED AND SO WAS THE INVADER
HE A PERSONAGE SHORT OF STATURE BUT STRAIGHT OF PORT AND BEARING ON
BROAD SHOULDERS A HAWK'S HEAD BEAK AND EYE THE WHOLE SURMOUNTED BY A
REHOBOAM OR SHOVEL HAT WHICH HE DID NOT SEEM TO THINK IT NECESSARY TO
LIFT OR REMOVE BEFORE THE PRESENCE IN WHICH HE THEN STOOD HE FOLDED
HIS ARMS ON HIS CHEST AND SURVEYED HIS YOUNG FRIENDS IF FRIENDS THEY
WERE MUCH AT HIS LEISURE
WHAT HE BEGAN DELIVERING HIS WORDS IN A VOICE NO LONGER NASAL BUT
DEEP MORE THAN DEEP A VOICE MADE PURPOSELY HOLLOW AND
CAVERNOUS WHAT HAS THE MIRACLE OF PENTECOST BEEN RENEWED HAVE THE
CLOVEN TONGUES COME DOWN AGAIN WHERE ARE THEY THE SOUND FILLED THE
WHOLE HOUSE JUST NOW
I HEARD THE SEVENTEEN LANGUAGES IN FULL ACTION
PARTHIANS AND MEDES AND ELAMITES THE DWELLERS IN MESOPOTAMIA AND IN
JUDEA AND CAPPADOCIA IN PONTUS AND ASIA PHRYGIA AND PAMPHYLIA IN
EGYPT AND IN THE PARTS OF LIBYA ABOUT CYRENE STRANGERS OF ROME JEWS
AND PROSELYTES CRETES AND ARABIANS EVERY ONE OF THESE MUST HAVE HAD
ITS REPRESENTATIVE IN THIS ROOM TWO MINUTES SINCE
I BEG YOUR PARDON MR
HELSTONE BEGAN MR
DONNE TAKE A SEAT PRAY
SIR
HAVE A GLASS OF WINE
HIS CIVILITIES RECEIVED NO ANSWER
THE FALCON IN THE BLACK COAT
PROCEEDED
WHAT DO I TALK ABOUT THE GIFT OF TONGUES GIFT INDEED I MISTOOK THE
CHAPTER AND BOOK AND TESTAMENT GOSPEL FOR LAW ACTS FOR GENESIS THE
CITY OF JERUSALEM FOR THE PLAIN OF SHINAR
IT WAS NO GIFT BUT THE
CONFUSION OF TONGUES WHICH HAS GABBLED ME DEAF AS A POST
YOU
APOSTLES WHAT YOU THREE CERTAINLY NOT THREE PRESUMPTUOUS BABYLONISH
MASONS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS
I ASSURE YOU SIR WE WERE ONLY HAVING A LITTLE CHAT TOGETHER OVER A
GLASS OF WINE AFTER A FRIENDLY DINNER SETTLING THE DISSENTERS
OH SETTLING THE DISSENTERS WERE YOU WAS MALONE SETTLING THE
DISSENTERS IT SOUNDED TO ME MUCH MORE LIKE SETTLING HIS CO APOSTLES
YOU WERE QUARRELLING TOGETHER MAKING ALMOST AS MUCH NOISE YOU THREE
ALONE AS MOSES BARRACLOUGH THE PREACHING TAILOR AND ALL HIS HEARERS
ARE MAKING IN THE METHODIST CHAPEL DOWN YONDER WHERE THEY ARE IN THE
THICK OF A REVIVAL
I KNOW WHOSE FAULT IT IS IT IS YOURS MALONE
MINE SIR
YOURS SIR
DONNE AND SWEETING WERE QUIET BEFORE YOU CAME AND WOULD BE
QUIET IF YOU WERE GONE
I WISH WHEN YOU CROSSED THE CHANNEL YOU HAD
LEFT YOUR IRISH HABITS BEHIND YOU
DUBLIN STUDENT WAYS WON'T DO HERE
THE PROCEEDINGS WHICH MIGHT PASS UNNOTICED IN A WILD BOG AND MOUNTAIN
DISTRICT IN CONNAUGHT WILL IN A DECENT ENGLISH PARISH BRING DISGRACE
ON THOSE WHO INDULGE IN THEM AND WHAT IS FAR WORSE ON THE SACRED
INSTITUTION OF WHICH THEY ARE MERELY THE HUMBLE APPENDAGES
THERE WAS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN THE LITTLE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN'S MANNER OF
REBUKING THESE YOUTHS THOUGH IT WAS NOT PERHAPS QUITE THE DIGNITY
MOST APPROPRIATE TO THE OCCASION
MR
HELSTONE STANDING STRAIGHT AS A
RAMROD LOOKING KEEN AS A KITE PRESENTED DESPITE HIS CLERICAL HAT
BLACK COAT AND GAITERS MORE THE AIR OF A VETERAN OFFICER CHIDING HIS
SUBALTERNS THAN OF A VENERABLE PRIEST EXHORTING HIS SONS IN THE FAITH
GOSPEL MILDNESS APOSTOLIC BENIGNITY NEVER SEEMED TO HAVE BREATHED
THEIR INFLUENCE OVER THAT KEEN BROWN VISAGE BUT FIRMNESS HAD FIXED THE
FEATURES AND SAGACITY HAD CARVED HER OWN LINES ABOUT THEM
I MET SUPPLEHOUGH HE CONTINUED PLODDING THROUGH THE MUD THIS WET
NIGHT GOING TO PREACH AT MILLDEAN OPPOSITION SHOP
AS I TOLD YOU I
HEARD BARRACLOUGH BELLOWING IN THE MIDST OF A CONVENTICLE LIKE A
POSSESSED BULL AND I FIND YOU GENTLEMEN TARRYING OVER YOUR
HALF PINT OF MUDDY PORT WINE AND SCOLDING LIKE ANGRY OLD WOMEN
NO
WONDER SUPPLEHOUGH SHOULD HAVE DIPPED SIXTEEN ADULT CONVERTS IN A
DAY WHICH HE DID A FORTNIGHT SINCE NO WONDER BARRACLOUGH SCAMP AND
HYPOCRITE AS HE IS SHOULD ATTRACT ALL THE WEAVER GIRLS IN THEIR FLOWERS
AND RIBBONS TO WITNESS HOW MUCH HARDER ARE HIS KNUCKLES THAN THE WOODEN
BRIM OF HIS TUB AS LITTLE WONDER THAT YOU WHEN YOU ARE LEFT TO
YOURSELVES WITHOUT YOUR RECTORS MYSELF AND HALL AND BOULTBY TO BACK
YOU SHOULD TOO OFTEN PERFORM THE HOLY SERVICE OF OUR CHURCH TO BARE
WALLS AND READ YOUR BIT OF A DRY DISCOURSE TO THE CLERK AND THE
ORGANIST AND THE BEADLE
BUT ENOUGH OF THE SUBJECT
I CAME TO SEE
MALONE I HAVE AN ERRAND UNTO THEE O CAPTAIN
WHAT IS IT INQUIRED MALONE DISCONTENTEDLY
THERE CAN BE NO FUNERAL
TO TAKE AT THIS TIME OF DAY
HAVE YOU ANY ARMS ABOUT YOU
ARMS SIR YES AND LEGS AND HE ADVANCED THE MIGHTY MEMBERS
BAH WEAPONS I MEAN
I HAVE THE PISTOLS YOU GAVE ME YOURSELF
I NEVER PART WITH THEM
I LAY
THEM READY COCKED ON A CHAIR BY MY BEDSIDE AT NIGHT
I HAVE MY
BLACKTHORN
VERY GOOD
WILL YOU GO TO HOLLOW'S MILL
WHAT IS STIRRING AT HOLLOW'S MILL
NOTHING AS YET NOR PERHAPS WILL BE BUT MOORE IS ALONE THERE
HE HAS
SENT ALL THE WORKMEN HE CAN TRUST TO STILBRO' THERE ARE ONLY TWO WOMEN
LEFT ABOUT THE PLACE
IT WOULD BE A NICE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY OF HIS
WELL WISHERS TO PAY HIM A VISIT IF THEY KNEW HOW STRAIGHT THE PATH WAS
MADE BEFORE THEM
I AM NONE OF HIS WELL WISHERS SIR
I DON'T CARE FOR HIM
SOH MALONE YOU ARE AFRAID
YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT
IF I REALLY THOUGHT THERE WAS A CHANCE
OF A ROW I WOULD GO BUT MOORE IS A STRANGE SHY MAN WHOM I NEVER
PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND AND FOR THE SAKE OF HIS SWEET COMPANY ONLY I
WOULD NOT STIR A STEP
BUT THERE IS A CHANCE OF A ROW IF A POSITIVE RIOT DOES NOT TAKE
PLACE OF WHICH INDEED I SEE NO SIGNS YET IT IS UNLIKELY THIS NIGHT
WILL PASS QUITE TRANQUILLY
YOU KNOW MOORE HAS RESOLVED TO HAVE NEW
MACHINERY AND HE EXPECTS TWO WAGON LOADS OF FRAMES AND SHEARS FROM
STILBRO' THIS EVENING
SCOTT THE OVERLOOKER AND A FEW PICKED MEN ARE
GONE TO FETCH THEM
THEY WILL BRING THEM IN SAFELY AND QUIETLY ENOUGH SIR
MOORE SAYS SO AND AFFIRMS HE WANTS NOBODY
SOME ONE HOWEVER HE MUST
HAVE IF IT WERE ONLY TO BEAR EVIDENCE IN CASE ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN
I
CALL HIM VERY CARELESS
HE SITS IN THE COUNTING HOUSE WITH THE SHUTTERS
UNCLOSED HE GOES OUT HERE AND THERE AFTER DARK WANDERS RIGHT UP THE
HOLLOW DOWN FIELDHEAD LANE AMONG THE PLANTATIONS JUST AS IF HE WERE
THE DARLING OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR BEING AS HE IS ITS
DETESTATION BORE A 'CHARMED LIFE AS THEY SAY IN TALE BOOKS
HE TAKES
NO WARNING FROM THE FATE OF PEARSON NOR FROM THAT OF ARMITAGE SHOT
ONE IN HIS OWN HOUSE AND THE OTHER ON THE MOOR
BUT HE SHOULD TAKE WARNING SIR AND USE PRECAUTIONS TOO INTERPOSED
MR
SWEETING AND I THINK HE WOULD IF HE HEARD WHAT I HEARD THE OTHER
DAY
WHAT DID YOU HEAR DAVY
YOU KNOW MIKE HARTLEY SIR
THE ANTINOMIAN WEAVER YES
WHEN MIKE HAS BEEN DRINKING FOR A FEW WEEKS TOGETHER HE GENERALLY
WINDS UP BY A VISIT TO NUNNELY VICARAGE TO TELL MR
HALL A PIECE OF HIS
MIND ABOUT HIS SERMONS TO DENOUNCE THE HORRIBLE TENDENCY OF HIS
DOCTRINE OF WORKS AND WARN HIM THAT HE AND ALL HIS HEARERS ARE SITTING
IN OUTER DARKNESS
WELL THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MOORE
BESIDES BEING AN ANTINOMIAN HE IS A VIOLENT JACOBIN AND LEVELLER
SIR
I KNOW
WHEN HE IS VERY DRUNK HIS MIND IS ALWAYS RUNNING ON REGICIDE
MIKE IS NOT UNACQUAINTED WITH HISTORY AND IT IS RICH TO HEAR HIM GOING
OVER THE LIST OF TYRANTS OF WHOM AS HE SAYS 'THE REVENGER OF BLOOD HAS
OBTAINED SATISFACTION THE FELLOW EXULTS STRANGELY IN MURDER DONE ON
CROWNED HEADS OR ON ANY HEAD FOR POLITICAL REASONS
I HAVE ALREADY
HEARD IT HINTED THAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE A QUEER HANKERING AFTER MOORE
IS
THAT WHAT YOU ALLUDE TO SWEETING
YOU USE THE PROPER TERM SIR
MR
HALL THINKS MIKE HAS NO PERSONAL
HATRED OF MOORE
MIKE SAYS HE EVEN LIKES TO TALK TO HIM AND RUN AFTER
HIM BUT HE HAS A HANKERING THAT MOORE SHOULD BE MADE AN EXAMPLE OF
HE WAS EXTOLLING HIM TO MR
HALL THE OTHER DAY AS THE MILL OWNER WITH
THE MOST BRAINS IN YORKSHIRE AND FOR THAT REASON HE AFFIRMS MOORE
SHOULD BE CHOSEN AS A SACRIFICE AN OBLATION OF A SWEET SAVOUR
IS MIKE
HARTLEY IN HIS RIGHT MIND DO YOU THINK SIR INQUIRED SWEETING SIMPLY
CAN'T TELL DAVY
HE MAY BE CRAZED OR HE MAY BE ONLY CRAFTY OR
PERHAPS A LITTLE OF BOTH
HE TALKS OF SEEING VISIONS SIR
AY HE IS A VERY EZEKIEL OR DANIEL FOR VISIONS
HE CAME JUST WHEN I WAS
GOING TO BED LAST FRIDAY NIGHT TO DESCRIBE ONE THAT HAD BEEN REVEALED TO
HIM IN NUNNELY PARK THAT VERY AFTERNOON
TELL IT SIR
WHAT WAS IT URGED SWEETING
DAVY THOU HAST AN ENORMOUS ORGAN OF WONDER IN THY CRANIUM
MALONE YOU
SEE HAS NONE
NEITHER MURDERS NOR VISIONS INTEREST HIM
SEE WHAT A BIG
VACANT SAPH HE LOOKS AT THIS MOMENT
SAPH WHO WAS SAPH SIR
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT KNOW
YOU MAY FIND IT OUT
IT IS BIBLICAL
I
KNOW NOTHING MORE OF HIM THAN HIS NAME AND RACE BUT FROM A BOY UPWARDS
I HAVE ALWAYS ATTACHED A PERSONALITY TO SAPH
DEPEND ON IT HE WAS
HONEST HEAVY AND LUCKLESS
HE MET HIS END AT GOB BY THE HAND OF
SIBBECHAI
BUT THE VISION SIR
DAVY THOU SHALT HEAR
DONNE IS BITING HIS NAILS AND MALONE YAWNING
SO I WILL TELL IT BUT TO THEE
MIKE IS OUT OF WORK LIKE MANY OTHERS
UNFORTUNATELY
MR
GRAME SIR PHILIP NUNNELY'S STEWARD GAVE HIM A JOB
ABOUT THE PRIORY
ACCORDING TO HIS ACCOUNT MIKE WAS BUSY HEDGING RATHER
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON BUT BEFORE DARK WHEN HE HEARD WHAT HE THOUGHT
WAS A BAND AT A DISTANCE BUGLES FIFES AND THE SOUND OF A TRUMPET IT
CAME FROM THE FOREST AND HE WONDERED THAT THERE SHOULD BE MUSIC THERE
HE LOOKED UP
ALL AMONGST THE TREES HE SAW MOVING OBJECTS RED LIKE
POPPIES OR WHITE LIKE MAY BLOSSOM
THE WOOD WAS FULL OF THEM THEY
POURED OUT AND FILLED THE PARK
HE THEN PERCEIVED THEY WERE
SOLDIERS THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS BUT THEY MADE NO MORE NOISE
THAN A SWARM OF MIDGES ON A SUMMER EVENING
THEY FORMED IN ORDER HE
AFFIRMED AND MARCHED REGIMENT AFTER REGIMENT ACROSS THE PARK
HE
FOLLOWED THEM TO NUNNELY COMMON THE MUSIC STILL PLAYED SOFT AND
DISTANT
ON THE COMMON HE WATCHED THEM GO THROUGH A NUMBER OF
EVOLUTIONS
A MAN CLOTHED IN SCARLET STOOD IN THE CENTRE AND DIRECTED
THEM
THEY EXTENDED HE DECLARED OVER FIFTY ACRES
THEY WERE IN SIGHT
HALF AN HOUR THEN THEY MARCHED AWAY QUITE SILENTLY
THE WHOLE TIME HE
HEARD NEITHER VOICE NOR TREAD NOTHING BUT THE FAINT MUSIC PLAYING A
SOLEMN MARCH
WHERE DID THEY GO SIR
TOWARDS BRIARFIELD
MIKE FOLLOWED THEM
THEY SEEMED PASSING FIELDHEAD
WHEN A COLUMN OF SMOKE SUCH AS MIGHT BE VOMITED BY A PARK OF ARTILLERY
SPREAD NOISELESS OVER THE FIELDS THE ROAD THE COMMON AND ROLLED HE
SAID BLUE AND DIM TO HIS VERY FEET
AS IT CLEARED AWAY HE LOOKED AGAIN
FOR THE SOLDIERS BUT THEY WERE VANISHED HE SAW THEM NO MORE
MIKE
LIKE A WISE DANIEL AS HE IS NOT ONLY REHEARSED THE VISION BUT GAVE THE
INTERPRETATION THEREOF
IT SIGNIFIES HE INTIMATED BLOODSHED AND CIVIL

GOING WHAT DO YOU SAY GENTLEMEN THE COMMISSION IS AN HONOURABLE ONE

MODESTY EACH GENTLEMAN RETIRED A STEP FROM THE PRESENTED WEAPON
I NEVER TOUCH THEM
I NEVER DID TOUCH ANYTHING OF THE KIND SAID MR

HELSTONE
MY MOTHER WOULDN'T LIKE IT PLEADED
SWEETING
AND I MAKE IT A RULE NEVER TO GET MIXED UP IN AFFAIRS OF THE KIND
OBSERVED DONNE
HELSTONE SMILED SARDONICALLY MALONE LAUGHED A HORSE LAUGH
HE THEN
REPLACED HIS ARMS TOOK HIS HAT AND CUDGEL AND SAYING THAT HE NEVER
FELT MORE IN TUNE FOR A SHINDY IN HIS LIFE AND THAT HE WISHED A SCORE
OF GREASY CLOTH DRESSERS MIGHT BEAT UP MOORE'S QUARTERS THAT NIGHT HE
MADE HIS EXIT CLEARING THE STAIRS AT A STRIDE OR TWO AND MAKING THE
HOUSE SHAKE WITH THE BANG OF THE FRONT DOOR BEHIND HIM
CHAPTER II
THE WAGONS
THE EVENING WAS PITCH DARK STAR AND MOON WERE QUENCHED IN GRAY
RAIN CLOUDS GRAY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BY DAY BY NIGHT THEY LOOKED
SABLE
MALONE WAS NOT A MAN GIVEN TO CLOSE OBSERVATION OF NATURE HER
CHANGES PASSED FOR THE MOST PART UNNOTICED BY HIM
HE COULD WALK MILES
ON THE MOST VARYING APRIL DAY AND NEVER SEE THE BEAUTIFUL DALLYING OF
EARTH AND HEAVEN NEVER MARK WHEN A SUNBEAM KISSED THE HILL TOPS MAKING
THEM SMILE CLEAR IN GREEN LIGHT OR WHEN A SHOWER WEPT OVER THEM HIDING
THEIR CRESTS WITH THE LOW HANGING DISHEVELLED TRESSES OF A CLOUD
HE
DID NOT THEREFORE CARE TO CONTRAST THE SKY AS IT NOW APPEARED A
MUFFLED STREAMING VAULT ALL BLACK SAVE WHERE TOWARDS THE EAST THE
FURNACES OF STILBRO' IRONWORKS THREW A TREMULOUS LURID SHIMMER ON THE
HORIZON WITH THE SAME SKY ON AN UNCLOUDED FROSTY NIGHT
HE DID NOT
TROUBLE HIMSELF TO ASK WHERE THE CONSTELLATIONS AND THE PLANETS WERE
GONE OR TO REGRET THE BLACK BLUE SERENITY OF THE AIR OCEAN WHICH
THOSE WHITE ISLETS STUD AND WHICH ANOTHER OCEAN OF HEAVIER AND DENSER
ELEMENT NOW ROLLED BELOW AND CONCEALED
HE JUST DOGGEDLY PURSUED HIS
WAY LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD AS HE WALKED AND WEARING HIS HAT ON THE
BACK OF HIS HEAD AS HIS IRISH MANNER WAS
TRAMP TRAMP HE WENT ALONG
THE CAUSEWAY WHERE THE ROAD BOASTED THE PRIVILEGE OF SUCH AN
ACCOMMODATION SPLASH SPLASH THROUGH THE MIRE FILLED CART RUTS
WHERE THE FLAGS WERE EXCHANGED FOR SOFT MUD
HE LOOKED BUT FOR CERTAIN
LANDMARKS THE SPIRE OF BRIARFIELD CHURCH FARTHER ON THE LIGHTS OF
REDHOUSE
THIS WAS AN INN AND WHEN HE REACHED IT THE GLOW OF A FIRE
THROUGH A HALF CURTAINED WINDOW A VISION OF GLASSES ON A ROUND TABLE
AND OF REVELLERS ON AN OAKEN SETTLE HAD NEARLY DRAWN ASIDE THE CURATE
FROM HIS COURSE
HE THOUGHT LONGINGLY OF A TUMBLER OF WHISKY AND WATER
IN A STRANGE PLACE HE WOULD INSTANTLY HAVE REALIZED THE DREAM BUT THE
COMPANY ASSEMBLED IN THAT KITCHEN WERE MR
HELSTONE'S OWN PARISHIONERS
THEY ALL KNEW HIM
HE SIGHED AND PASSED ON
THE HIGHROAD WAS NOW TO BE QUITTED AS THE REMAINING DISTANCE TO
HOLLOW'S MILL MIGHT BE CONSIDERABLY REDUCED BY A SHORT CUT ACROSS
FIELDS
THESE FIELDS WERE LEVEL AND MONOTONOUS
MALONE TOOK A DIRECT
COURSE THROUGH THEM JUMPING HEDGE AND WALL
HE PASSED BUT ONE BUILDING
HERE AND THAT SEEMED LARGE AND HALL LIKE THOUGH IRREGULAR
YOU COULD
SEE A HIGH GABLE THEN A LONG FRONT THEN A LOW GABLE THEN A THICK
LOFTY STACK OF CHIMNEYS
THERE WERE SOME TREES BEHIND IT
IT WAS DARK
NOT A CANDLE SHONE FROM ANY WINDOW
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY STILL THE RAIN
RUNNING FROM THE EAVES AND THE RATHER WILD BUT VERY LOW WHISTLE OF THE
WIND ROUND THE CHIMNEYS AND THROUGH THE BOUGHS WERE THE SOLE SOUNDS IN
ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD
THIS BUILDING PASSED THE FIELDS HITHERTO FLAT DECLINED IN A RAPID
DESCENT
EVIDENTLY A VALE LAY BELOW THROUGH WHICH YOU COULD HEAR THE
WATER RUN
ONE LIGHT GLIMMERED IN THE DEPTH
FOR THAT BEACON MALONE
STEERED
HE CAME TO A LITTLE WHITE HOUSE YOU COULD SEE IT WAS WHITE EVEN THROUGH
THIS DENSE DARKNESS AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
A FRESH FACED SERVANT
OPENED IT
BY THE CANDLE SHE HELD WAS REVEALED A NARROW PASSAGE
TERMINATING IN A NARROW STAIR
TWO DOORS COVERED WITH CRIMSON BAIZE A
STRIP OF CRIMSON CARPET DOWN THE STEPS CONTRASTED WITH LIGHT COLOURED
WALLS AND WHITE FLOOR MADE THE LITTLE INTERIOR LOOK CLEAN AND FRESH
MR
MOORE IS AT HOME I SUPPOSE
YES SIR BUT HE IS NOT IN
NOT IN WHERE IS HE THEN
AT THE MILL IN THE COUNTING HOUSE
HERE ONE OF THE CRIMSON DOORS OPENED
ARE THE WAGONS COME SARAH ASKED A FEMALE VOICE AND A FEMALE HEAD AT
THE SAME TIME WAS APPARENT
IT MIGHT NOT BE THE HEAD OF A
GODDESS INDEED A SCREW OF CURL PAPER ON EACH SIDE THE TEMPLES QUITE
FORBADE THAT SUPPOSITION BUT NEITHER WAS IT THE HEAD OF A GORGON YET
MALONE SEEMED TO TAKE IT IN THE LATTER LIGHT
BIG AS HE WAS HE SHRANK
BASHFULLY BACK INTO THE RAIN AT THE VIEW THEREOF AND SAYING I'LL GO
TO HIM HURRIED IN SEEMING TREPIDATION DOWN A SHORT LANE ACROSS AN
OBSCURE YARD TOWARDS A HUGE BLACK MILL
THE WORK HOURS WERE OVER THE HANDS WERE GONE
THE MACHINERY WAS AT
REST THE MILL SHUT UP
MALONE WALKED ROUND IT
SOMEWHERE IN ITS GREAT
SOOTY FLANK HE FOUND ANOTHER CHINK OF LIGHT HE KNOCKED AT ANOTHER
DOOR USING FOR THE PURPOSE THE THICK END OF HIS SHILLELAH WITH WHICH
HE BEAT A ROUSING TATTOO
A KEY TURNED THE DOOR UNCLOSED
IS IT JOE SCOTT WHAT NEWS OF THE WAGONS JOE
NO IT'S MYSELF
MR
HELSTONE WOULD SEND ME
OH MR
MALONE THE VOICE IN UTTERING THIS NAME HAD THE SLIGHTEST
POSSIBLE CADENCE OF DISAPPOINTMENT
AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE IT CONTINUED
POLITELY BUT A LITTLE FORMALLY
I BEG YOU WILL COME IN MR
MALONE
I REGRET EXTREMELY MR
HELSTONE
SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO TROUBLE YOU SO FAR
THERE WAS NO
NECESSITY I TOLD HIM SO AND ON SUCH A NIGHT BUT WALK FORWARDS
THROUGH A DARK APARTMENT OF ASPECT UNDISTINGUISHABLE MALONE FOLLOWED
THE SPEAKER INTO A LIGHT AND BRIGHT ROOM WITHIN VERY LIGHT AND BRIGHT
INDEED IT SEEMED TO EYES WHICH FOR THE LAST HOUR HAD BEEN STRIVING TO
PENETRATE THE DOUBLE DARKNESS OF NIGHT AND FOG BUT EXCEPT FOR ITS
EXCELLENT FIRE AND FOR A LAMP OF ELEGANT DESIGN AND VIVID LUSTRE
BURNING ON A TABLE IT WAS A VERY PLAIN PLACE
THE BOARDED FLOOR WAS
CARPETLESS THE THREE OR FOUR STIFF BACKED GREEN PAINTED CHAIRS SEEMED
ONCE TO HAVE FURNISHED THE KITCHEN OF SOME FARM HOUSE A DESK OF STRONG
SOLID FORMATION THE TABLE AFORESAID AND SOME FRAMED SHEETS ON THE
STONE COLOURED WALLS BEARING PLANS FOR BUILDING FOR GARDENING DESIGNS
OF MACHINERY ETC COMPLETED THE FURNITURE OF THE PLACE
PLAIN AS IT WAS IT SEEMED TO SATISFY MALONE WHO WHEN HE HAD REMOVED
AND HUNG UP HIS WET SURTOUT AND HAT DREW ONE OF THE RHEUMATIC LOOKING
CHAIRS TO THE HEARTH AND SET HIS KNEES ALMOST WITHIN THE BARS OF THE
RED GRATE
COMFORTABLE QUARTERS YOU HAVE HERE MR
MOORE AND ALL SNUG TO
YOURSELF
YES BUT MY SISTER WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU IF YOU WOULD PREFER
STEPPING INTO THE HOUSE
OH NO THE LADIES ARE BEST ALONE I NEVER WAS A LADY'S MAN
YOU DON'T
MISTAKE ME FOR MY FRIEND SWEETING DO YOU MR
MOORE
SWEETING WHICH OF THEM IS THAT THE GENTLEMAN IN THE CHOCOLATE
OVERCOAT OR THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN
THE LITTLE ONE HE OF NUNNELY THE CAVALIER OF THE MISSES SYKES WITH
THE WHOLE SIX OF WHOM HE IS IN LOVE HA HA
BETTER BE GENERALLY IN LOVE WITH ALL THAN SPECIALLY WITH ONE I SHOULD
THINK IN THAT QUARTER
BUT HE IS SPECIALLY IN LOVE WITH ONE BESIDES FOR WHEN I AND DONNE
URGED HIM TO MAKE A CHOICE AMONGST THE FAIR BEVY HE NAMED WHICH DO YOU
THINK
WITH A QUEER QUIET SMILE MR
MOORE REPLIED DORA OF COURSE OR
HARRIET
HA HA YOU'VE AN EXCELLENT GUESS
BUT WHAT MADE YOU HIT ON THOSE TWO
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TALLEST THE HANDSOMEST AND DORA AT LEAST IS
THE STOUTEST AND AS YOUR FRIEND MR
SWEETING IS BUT A LITTLE SLIGHT
FIGURE I CONCLUDED THAT ACCORDING TO A FREQUENT RULE IN SUCH CASES HE
PREFERRED HIS CONTRAST
YOU ARE RIGHT DORA IT IS
BUT HE HAS NO CHANCE HAS HE MOORE
WHAT HAS MR
SWEETING BESIDES HIS CURACY
THIS QUESTION SEEMED TO TICKLE MALONE AMAZINGLY
HE LAUGHED FOR FULL
THREE MINUTES BEFORE HE ANSWERED IT
WHAT HAS SWEETING WHY DAVID HAS HIS HARP OR FLUTE WHICH COMES TO
THE SAME THING
HE HAS A SORT OF PINCHBECK WATCH DITTO RING DITTO
EYEGLASS
THAT'S WHAT HE HAS
HOW WOULD HE PROPOSE TO KEEP MISS SYKES IN GOWNS ONLY
HA HA EXCELLENT I'LL ASK HIM THAT NEXT TIME I SEE HIM
I'LL ROAST
HIM FOR HIS PRESUMPTION
BUT NO DOUBT HE EXPECTS OLD CHRISTOPHER SYKES
WOULD DO SOMETHING HANDSOME
HE IS RICH IS HE NOT THEY LIVE IN A LARGE
HOUSE
SYKES CARRIES ON AN EXTENSIVE CONCERN
THEREFORE HE MUST BE WEALTHY EH
THEREFORE HE MUST HAVE PLENTY TO DO WITH HIS WEALTH AND IN THESE TIMES
WOULD BE ABOUT AS LIKELY TO THINK OF DRAWING MONEY FROM THE BUSINESS TO
GIVE DOWRIES TO HIS DAUGHTERS AS I SHOULD BE TO DREAM OF PULLING DOWN
THE COTTAGE THERE AND CONSTRUCTING ON ITS RUINS A HOUSE AS LARGE AS
FIELDHEAD
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I HEARD MOORE THE OTHER DAY
NO
PERHAPS THAT I WAS ABOUT TO EFFECT SOME SUCH CHANGE
YOUR
BRIARFIELD GOSSIPS ARE CAPABLE OF SAYING THAT OR SILLIER THINGS
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE FIELDHEAD ON A LEASE I THOUGHT IT LOOKED A
DISMAL PLACE BY THE BYE TO NIGHT AS I PASSED IT AND THAT IT WAS
YOUR INTENTION TO SETTLE A MISS SYKES THERE AS MISTRESS TO BE MARRIED
IN SHORT HA HA NOW WHICH IS IT DORA I AM SURE
YOU SAID SHE WAS
THE HANDSOMEST
I WONDER HOW OFTEN IT HAS BEEN SETTLED THAT I WAS TO BE MARRIED SINCE I
CAME TO BRIARFIELD
THEY HAVE ASSIGNED ME EVERY MARRIAGEABLE SINGLE
WOMAN BY TURNS IN THE DISTRICT
NOW IT WAS THE TWO MISSES WYNNS FIRST
THE DARK THEN THE LIGHT ONE NOW THE RED HAIRED MISS ARMITAGE THEN THE
MATURE ANN PEARSON
AT PRESENT YOU THROW ON MY SHOULDERS ALL THE TRIBE
OF THE MISSES SYKES
ON WHAT GROUNDS THIS GOSSIP RESTS GOD KNOWS
I
VISIT NOWHERE I SEEK FEMALE SOCIETY ABOUT AS ASSIDUOUSLY AS YOU DO MR
MALONE
IF EVER I GO TO WHINBURY IT IS ONLY TO GIVE SYKES OR PEARSON A
CALL IN THEIR COUNTING HOUSE WHERE OUR DISCUSSIONS RUN ON OTHER TOPICS
THAN MATRIMONY AND OUR THOUGHTS ARE OCCUPIED WITH OTHER THINGS THAN
COURTSHIPS ESTABLISHMENTS DOWRIES
THE CLOTH WE CAN'T SELL THE HANDS
WE CAN'T EMPLOY THE MILLS WE CAN'T RUN THE PERVERSE COURSE OF EVENTS
GENERALLY WHICH WE CANNOT ALTER FILL OUR HEARTS I TAKE IT PRETTY
WELL AT PRESENT TO THE TOLERABLY COMPLETE EXCLUSION OF SUCH FIGMENTS AS
LOVE MAKING ETC
I GO ALONG WITH YOU COMPLETELY MOORE
IF THERE IS ONE NOTION I HATE
MORE THAN ANOTHER IT IS THAT OF MARRIAGE I MEAN MARRIAGE IN THE VULGAR
WEAK SENSE AS A MERE MATTER OF SENTIMENT TWO BEGGARLY FOOLS AGREEING
TO UNITE THEIR INDIGENCE BY SOME FANTASTIC TIE OF FEELING
HUMBUG BUT
AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION SUCH AS CAN BE FORMED IN CONSONANCE WITH
DIGNITY OF VIEWS AND PERMANENCY OF SOLID INTERESTS IS NOT SO BAD EH
NO RESPONDED MOORE IN AN ABSENT MANNER
THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO HAVE
NO INTEREST FOR HIM HE DID NOT PURSUE IT
AFTER SITTING FOR SOME TIME
GAZING AT THE FIRE WITH A PREOCCUPIED AIR HE SUDDENLY TURNED HIS HEAD
HARK SAID HE
DID YOU HEAR WHEELS
RISING HE WENT TO THE WINDOW OPENED IT AND LISTENED
HE SOON CLOSED
IT
IT IS ONLY THE SOUND OF THE WIND RISING HE REMARKED AND THE
RIVULET A LITTLE SWOLLEN RUSHING DOWN THE HOLLOW
I EXPECTED THOSE
WAGONS AT SIX IT IS NEAR NINE NOW
SERIOUSLY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT THE PUTTING UP OF THIS NEW MACHINERY
WILL BRING YOU INTO DANGER INQUIRED MALONE
HELSTONE SEEMS TO THINK
IT WILL
I ONLY WISH THE MACHINES THE FRAMES WERE SAFE HERE AND LODGED WITHIN
THE WALLS OF THIS MILL
ONCE PUT UP I DEFY THE FRAME BREAKERS
LET THEM
ONLY PAY ME A VISIT AND TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES
MY MILL IS MY CASTLE
ONE DESPISES SUCH LOW SCOUNDRELS OBSERVED MALONE IN A PROFOUND VEIN
OF REFLECTION
I ALMOST WISH A PARTY WOULD CALL UPON YOU TO NIGHT BUT
THE ROAD SEEMED EXTREMELY QUIET AS I CAME ALONG
I SAW NOTHING ASTIR
YOU CAME BY THE REDHOUSE
YES
THERE WOULD BE NOTHING ON THAT ROAD
IT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF STILBRO'
THE RISK LIES
AND YOU THINK THERE IS RISK
WHAT THESE FELLOWS HAVE DONE TO OTHERS THEY MAY DO TO ME
THERE IS ONLY
THIS DIFFERENCE MOST OF THE MANUFACTURERS SEEM PARALYZED WHEN THEY ARE
ATTACKED
SYKES FOR INSTANCE WHEN HIS DRESSING SHOP WAS SET ON FIRE
AND BURNED TO THE GROUND WHEN THE CLOTH WAS TORN FROM HIS TENTERS AND
LEFT IN SHREDS IN THE FIELD TOOK NO STEPS TO DISCOVER OR PUNISH THE
MISCREANTS HE GAVE UP AS TAMELY AS A RABBIT UNDER THE JAWS OF A FERRET
NOW I IF I KNOW MYSELF SHOULD STAND BY MY TRADE MY MILL AND MY
MACHINERY
HELSTONE SAYS THESE THREE ARE YOUR GODS THAT THE 'ORDERS IN COUNCIL'
ARE WITH YOU ANOTHER NAME FOR THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS THAT CASTLEREAGH IS
YOUR ANTICHRIST AND THE WAR PARTY HIS LEGIONS
YES I ABHOR ALL THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY RUIN ME
THEY STAND IN MY
WAY
I CANNOT GET ON
I CANNOT EXECUTE MY PLANS BECAUSE OF THEM
I SEE
MYSELF BAFFLED AT EVERY TURN BY THEIR UNTOWARD EFFECTS
BUT YOU ARE RICH AND THRIVING MOORE
I AM VERY RICH IN CLOTH I CANNOT SELL
YOU SHOULD STEP INTO MY
WAREHOUSE YONDER AND OBSERVE HOW IT IS PILED TO THE ROOF WITH PIECES
ROAKES AND PEARSON ARE IN THE SAME CONDITION
AMERICA USED TO BE THEIR
MARKET BUT THE ORDERS IN COUNCIL HAVE CUT THAT OFF
MALONE DID NOT SEEM PREPARED TO CARRY ON BRISKLY A CONVERSATION OF THIS
SORT
HE BEGAN TO KNOCK THE HEELS OF HIS BOOTS TOGETHER AND TO YAWN
AND THEN TO THINK CONTINUED MR
MOORE WHO SEEMED TOO MUCH TAKEN UP
WITH THE CURRENT OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE SYMPTOMS OF HIS GUEST'S
ENNUI TO THINK THAT THESE RIDICULOUS GOSSIPS OF WHINBURY AND
BRIARFIELD WILL KEEP PESTERING ONE ABOUT BEING MARRIED AS IF THERE WAS
NOTHING TO BE DONE IN LIFE BUT TO 'PAY ATTENTION AS THEY SAY TO SOME
YOUNG LADY AND THEN TO GO TO CHURCH WITH HER AND THEN TO START ON A
BRIDAL TOUR AND THEN TO RUN THROUGH A ROUND OF VISITS AND THEN I
SUPPOSE TO BE 'HAVING A FAMILY OH QUE LE DIABLE EMPORTE HE BROKE
OFF THE ASPIRATION INTO WHICH HE WAS LAUNCHING WITH A CERTAIN ENERGY
AND ADDED MORE CALMLY I BELIEVE WOMEN TALK AND THINK ONLY OF THESE
THINGS AND THEY NATURALLY FANCY MEN'S MINDS SIMILARLY OCCUPIED
OF COURSE OF COURSE ASSENTED MALONE BUT NEVER MIND THEM AND HE
WHISTLED LOOKED IMPATIENTLY ROUND AND SEEMED TO FEEL A GREAT WANT OF
SOMETHING
THIS TIME MOORE CAUGHT AND IT APPEARED COMPREHENDED HIS
DEMONSTRATIONS
MR
MALONE SAID HE YOU MUST REQUIRE REFRESHMENT AFTER YOUR WET
WALK
I FORGET HOSPITALITY
NOT AT ALL REJOINED MALONE BUT HE LOOKED AS IF THE RIGHT NAIL WAS AT
LAST HIT ON THE HEAD NEVERTHELESS
MOORE ROSE AND OPENED A CUPBOARD
IT IS MY FANCY SAID HE TO HAVE EVERY CONVENIENCE WITHIN MYSELF AND
NOT TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE FEMINITY IN THE COTTAGE YONDER FOR EVERY
MOUTHFUL I EAT OR EVERY DROP I DRINK
I OFTEN SPEND THE EVENING AND SUP
HERE ALONE AND SLEEP WITH JOE SCOTT IN THE MILL
SOMETIMES I AM MY OWN
WATCHMAN
I REQUIRE LITTLE SLEEP AND IT PLEASES ME ON A FINE NIGHT TO
WANDER FOR AN HOUR OR TWO WITH MY MUSKET ABOUT THE HOLLOW
MR
MALONE
CAN YOU COOK A MUTTON CHOP
TRY ME
I'VE DONE IT HUNDREDS OF TIMES AT COLLEGE
THERE'S A DISHFUL THEN AND THERE'S THE GRIDIRON
TURN THEM QUICKLY
YOU KNOW THE SECRET OF KEEPING THE JUICES IN
NEVER FEAR ME YOU SHALL SEE
HAND A KNIFE AND FORK PLEASE
THE CURATE TURNED UP HIS COAT CUFFS AND APPLIED HIMSELF TO THE COOKERY
WITH VIGOUR
THE MANUFACTURER PLACED ON THE TABLE PLATES A LOAF OF
BREAD A BLACK BOTTLE AND TWO TUMBLERS
HE THEN PRODUCED A SMALL COPPER
KETTLE STILL FROM THE SAME WELL STORED RECESS HIS CUPBOARD FILLED IT
WITH WATER FROM A LARGE STONE JAR IN A CORNER SET IT ON THE FIRE BESIDE
THE HISSING GRIDIRON GOT LEMONS SUGAR AND A SMALL CHINA PUNCH BOWL
BUT WHILE HE WAS BREWING THE PUNCH A TAP AT THE DOOR CALLED HIM AWAY
IS IT YOU SARAH
YES SIR
WILL YOU COME TO SUPPER PLEASE SIR
NO I SHALL NOT BE IN TO NIGHT I SHALL SLEEP IN THE MILL
SO LOCK THE
DOORS AND TELL YOUR MISTRESS TO GO TO BED
HE RETURNED
YOU HAVE YOUR HOUSEHOLD IN PROPER ORDER OBSERVED MALONE APPROVINGLY
AS WITH HIS FINE FACE RUDDY AS THE EMBERS OVER WHICH HE BENT HE
ASSIDUOUSLY TURNED THE MUTTON CHOPS
YOU ARE NOT UNDER PETTICOAT
GOVERNMENT LIKE POOR SWEETING A MAN WHEW HOW THE FAT SPITS IT HAS
BURNT MY HAND DESTINED TO BE RULED BY WOMEN
NOW YOU AND I
MOORE THERE'S A FINE BROWN ONE FOR YOU AND FULL OF GRAVY YOU AND I
WILL HAVE NO GRAY MARES IN OUR STABLES WHEN WE MARRY
I DON'T KNOW I NEVER THINK ABOUT IT
IF THE GRAY MARE IS HANDSOME AND
TRACTABLE WHY NOT
THE CHOPS ARE DONE
IS THE PUNCH BREWED
THERE IS A GLASSFUL
TASTE IT
WHEN JOE SCOTT AND HIS MINIONS RETURN
THEY SHALL HAVE A SHARE OF THIS PROVIDED THEY BRING HOME THE FRAMES
INTACT
MALONE WAXED VERY EXULTANT OVER THE SUPPER
HE LAUGHED ALOUD AT TRIFLES
MADE BAD JOKES AND APPLAUDED THEM HIMSELF AND IN SHORT GREW
UNMEANINGLY NOISY
HIS HOST ON THE CONTRARY REMAINED QUIET AS BEFORE
IT IS TIME READER THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE APPEARANCE OF
THIS SAME HOST
I MUST ENDEAVOUR TO SKETCH HIM AS HE SITS AT TABLE
HE IS WHAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY CALL AT FIRST VIEW RATHER A
STRANGE LOOKING MAN FOR HE IS THIN DARK SALLOW VERY FOREIGN OF
ASPECT WITH SHADOWY HAIR CARELESSLY STREAKING HIS FOREHEAD
IT APPEARS
THAT HE SPENDS BUT LITTLE TIME AT HIS TOILET OR HE WOULD ARRANGE IT
WITH MORE TASTE
HE SEEMS UNCONSCIOUS THAT HIS FEATURES ARE FINE THAT
THEY HAVE A SOUTHERN SYMMETRY CLEARNESS REGULARITY IN THEIR
CHISELLING NOR DOES A SPECTATOR BECOME AWARE OF THIS ADVANTAGE TILL HE
HAS EXAMINED HIM WELL FOR AN ANXIOUS COUNTENANCE AND A HOLLOW SOMEWHAT
HAGGARD OUTLINE OF FACE DISTURB THE IDEA OF BEAUTY WITH ONE OF CARE
HIS EYES ARE LARGE AND GRAVE AND GRAY THEIR EXPRESSION IS INTENT AND
MEDITATIVE RATHER SEARCHING THAN SOFT RATHER THOUGHTFUL THAN GENIAL
WHEN HE PARTS HIS LIPS IN A SMILE HIS PHYSIOGNOMY IS AGREEABLE NOT
THAT IT IS FRANK OR CHEERFUL EVEN THEN BUT YOU FEEL THE INFLUENCE OF A
CERTAIN SEDATE CHARM SUGGESTIVE WHETHER TRULY OR DELUSIVELY OF A
CONSIDERATE PERHAPS A KIND NATURE OF FEELINGS THAT MAY WEAR WELL AT
HOME PATIENT FORBEARING POSSIBLY FAITHFUL FEELINGS
HE IS STILL
YOUNG NOT MORE THAN THIRTY HIS STATURE IS TALL HIS FIGURE SLENDER
HIS MANNER OF SPEAKING DISPLEASES
HE HAS AN OUTLANDISH ACCENT WHICH
NOTWITHSTANDING A STUDIED CARELESSNESS OF PRONUNCIATION AND DICTION
GRATES ON A BRITISH AND ESPECIALLY ON A YORKSHIRE EAR
MR
MOORE INDEED WAS BUT HALF A BRITON AND SCARCELY THAT
HE CAME OF
A FOREIGN ANCESTRY BY THE MOTHER'S SIDE AND WAS HIMSELF BORN AND PARTLY
REARED ON A FOREIGN SOIL
A HYBRID IN NATURE IT IS PROBABLE HE HAD A
HYBRID'S FEELING ON MANY POINTS PATRIOTISM FOR ONE IT IS LIKELY THAT
HE WAS UNAPT TO ATTACH HIMSELF TO PARTIES TO SECTS EVEN TO CLIMES AND
CUSTOMS IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE HAD A TENDENCY TO ISOLATE HIS
INDIVIDUAL PERSON FROM ANY COMMUNITY AMIDST WHICH HIS LOT MIGHT
TEMPORARILY HAPPEN TO BE THROWN AND THAT HE FELT IT TO BE HIS BEST
WISDOM TO PUSH THE INTERESTS OF ROBERT GRARD MOORE TO THE EXCLUSION OF
PHILANTHROPIC CONSIDERATION FOR GENERAL INTERESTS WITH WHICH HE
REGARDED THE SAID GRARD MOORE AS IN A GREAT MEASURE DISCONNECTED
TRADE
WAS MR
MOORE'S HEREDITARY CALLING THE GRARDS OF ANTWERP HAD BEEN
MERCHANTS FOR TWO CENTURIES BACK
ONCE THEY HAD BEEN WEALTHY MERCHANTS
BUT THE UNCERTAINTIES THE INVOLVEMENTS OF BUSINESS HAD COME UPON THEM
DISASTROUS SPECULATIONS HAD LOOSENED BY DEGREES THE FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR
CREDIT
THE HOUSE HAD STOOD ON A TOTTERING BASE FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND
AT LAST IN THE SHOCK OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION IT HAD RUSHED DOWN A
TOTAL RUIN
IN ITS FALL WAS INVOLVED THE ENGLISH AND YORKSHIRE FIRM OF
MOORE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE ANTWERP HOUSE AND OF WHICH ONE OF THE
PARTNERS RESIDENT IN ANTWERP ROBERT MOORE HAD MARRIED HORTENSE
GRARD WITH THE PROSPECT OF HIS BRIDE INHERITING HER FATHER CONSTANTINE
GRARD'S SHARE IN THE BUSINESS
SHE INHERITED AS WE HAVE SEEN BUT HIS
SHARE IN THE LIABILITIES OF THE FIRM AND THESE LIABILITIES THOUGH DULY
SET ASIDE BY A COMPOSITION WITH CREDITORS SOME SAID HER SON ROBERT
ACCEPTED IN HIS TURN AS A LEGACY AND THAT HE ASPIRED ONE DAY TO
DISCHARGE THEM AND TO REBUILD THE FALLEN HOUSE OF GRARD AND MOORE ON A
SCALE AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS FORMER GREATNESS
IT WAS EVEN SUPPOSED THAT
HE TOOK BY PAST CIRCUMSTANCES MUCH TO HEART AND IF A CHILDHOOD PASSED
AT THE SIDE OF A SATURNINE MOTHER UNDER FOREBODING OF COMING EVIL AND
A MANHOOD DRENCHED AND BLIGHTED BY THE PITILESS DESCENT OF THE STORM
COULD PAINFULLY IMPRESS THE MIND HIS PROBABLY WAS IMPRESSED IN NO
GOLDEN CHARACTERS
IF HOWEVER HE HAD A GREAT END OF RESTORATION IN VIEW IT WAS NOT IN
HIS POWER TO EMPLOY GREAT MEANS FOR ITS ATTAINMENT
HE WAS OBLIGED TO BE
CONTENT WITH THE DAY OF SMALL THINGS
WHEN HE CAME TO YORKSHIRE
HE WHOSE ANCESTORS HAD OWNED WAREHOUSES IN THIS SEAPORT AND FACTORIES
IN THAT INLAND TOWN HAD POSSESSED THEIR TOWN HOUSE AND THEIR
COUNTRY SEAT SAW NO WAY OPEN TO HIM BUT TO RENT A CLOTH MILL IN AN
OUT OF THE WAY NOOK OF AN OUT OF THE WAY DISTRICT TO TAKE A COTTAGE
ADJOINING IT FOR HIS RESIDENCE AND TO ADD TO HIS POSSESSIONS AS
PASTURE FOR HIS HORSE AND SPACE FOR HIS CLOTH TENTERS A FEW ACRES OF
THE STEEP RUGGED LAND THAT LINED THE HOLLOW THROUGH WHICH HIS
MILL STREAM BRAWLED
ALL THIS HE HELD AT A SOMEWHAT HIGH RENT FOR THESE
WAR TIMES WERE HARD AND EVERYTHING WAS DEAR OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE
FIELDHEAD ESTATE THEN THE PROPERTY OF A MINOR
AT THE TIME THIS HISTORY COMMENCES ROBERT MOORE HAD LIVED BUT TWO YEARS
IN THE DISTRICT DURING WHICH PERIOD HE HAD AT LEAST PROVED HIMSELF
POSSESSED OF THE QUALITY OF ACTIVITY
THE DINGY COTTAGE WAS CONVERTED
INTO A NEAT TASTEFUL RESIDENCE
OF PART OF THE ROUGH LAND HE HAD MADE
GARDEN GROUND WHICH HE CULTIVATED WITH SINGULAR EVEN WITH FLEMISH
EXACTNESS AND CARE
AS TO THE MILL WHICH WAS AN OLD STRUCTURE AND
FITTED UP WITH OLD MACHINERY NOW BECOME INEFFICIENT AND OUT OF DATE HE
HAD FROM THE FIRST EVINCED THE STRONGEST CONTEMPT FOR ALL ITS
ARRANGEMENTS AND APPOINTMENTS
HIS AIM HAD BEEN TO EFFECT A RADICAL
REFORM WHICH HE HAD EXECUTED AS FAST AS HIS VERY LIMITED CAPITAL WOULD
ALLOW AND THE NARROWNESS OF THAT CAPITAL AND CONSEQUENT CHECK ON HIS
PROGRESS WAS A RESTRAINT WHICH GALLED HIS SPIRIT SORELY
MOORE EVER
WANTED TO PUSH ON
FORWARD WAS THE DEVICE STAMPED UPON HIS SOUL BUT
POVERTY CURBED HIM
SOMETIMES FIGURATIVELY HE FOAMED AT THE MOUTH WHEN
THE REINS WERE DRAWN VERY TIGHT
IN THIS STATE OF FEELING IT IS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD
DELIBERATE MUCH AS TO WHETHER HIS ADVANCE WAS OR WAS NOT PREJUDICIAL TO
OTHERS
NOT BEING A NATIVE NOR FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME A RESIDENT OF THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD HE DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY CARE WHEN THE NEW INVENTIONS
THREW THE OLD WORKPEOPLE OUT OF EMPLOY
HE NEVER ASKED HIMSELF WHERE
THOSE TO WHOM HE NO LONGER PAID WEEKLY WAGES FOUND DAILY BREAD AND IN
THIS NEGLIGENCE HE ONLY RESEMBLED THOUSANDS BESIDES ON WHOM THE
STARVING POOR OF YORKSHIRE SEEMED TO HAVE A CLOSER CLAIM
THE PERIOD OF WHICH I WRITE WAS AN OVERSHADOWED ONE IN BRITISH HISTORY
AND ESPECIALLY IN THE HISTORY OF THE NORTHERN PROVINCES
WAR WAS THEN
AT ITS HEIGHT
EUROPE WAS ALL INVOLVED THEREIN
ENGLAND IF NOT WEARY
WAS WORN WITH LONG RESISTANCE YES AND HALF HER PEOPLE WERE WEARY TOO
AND CRIED OUT FOR PEACE ON ANY TERMS
NATIONAL HONOUR WAS BECOME A MERE
EMPTY NAME OF NO VALUE IN THE EYES OF MANY BECAUSE THEIR SIGHT WAS DIM
WITH FAMINE AND FOR A MORSEL OF MEAT THEY WOULD HAVE SOLD THEIR
BIRTHRIGHT
THE ORDERS IN COUNCIL PROVOKED BY NAPOLEON'S MILAN AND BERLIN
DECREES AND FORBIDDING NEUTRAL POWERS TO TRADE WITH FRANCE HAD BY
OFFENDING AMERICA CUT OFF THE PRINCIPAL MARKET OF THE YORKSHIRE WOOLLEN
TRADE AND BROUGHT IT CONSEQUENTLY TO THE VERGE OF RUIN
MINOR FOREIGN
MARKETS WERE GLUTTED AND WOULD RECEIVE NO MORE
THE BRAZILS PORTUGAL
SICILY WERE ALL OVERSTOCKED BY NEARLY TWO YEARS' CONSUMPTION
AT THIS
CRISIS CERTAIN INVENTIONS IN MACHINERY WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE STAPLE
MANUFACTURES OF THE NORTH WHICH GREATLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF HANDS
NECESSARY TO BE EMPLOYED THREW THOUSANDS OUT OF WORK AND LEFT THEM
WITHOUT LEGITIMATE MEANS OF SUSTAINING LIFE
A BAD HARVEST SUPERVENED
DISTRESS REACHED ITS CLIMAX
ENDURANCE OVERGOADED STRETCHED THE HAND
OF FRATERNITY TO SEDITION
THE THROES OF A SORT OF MORAL EARTHQUAKE WERE
FELT HEAVING UNDER THE HILLS OF THE NORTHERN COUNTIES
BUT AS IS USUAL
IN SUCH CASES NOBODY TOOK MUCH NOTICE
WHEN A FOOD RIOT BROKE OUT IN A
MANUFACTURING TOWN WHEN A GIG MILL WAS BURNT TO THE GROUND OR A
MANUFACTURER'S HOUSE WAS ATTACKED THE FURNITURE THROWN INTO THE
STREETS AND THE FAMILY FORCED TO FLEE FOR THEIR LIVES SOME LOCAL
MEASURES WERE OR WERE NOT TAKEN BY THE LOCAL MAGISTRACY
A RINGLEADER
WAS DETECTED OR MORE FREQUENTLY SUFFERED TO ELUDE DETECTION NEWSPAPER
PARAGRAPHS WERE WRITTEN ON THE SUBJECT AND THERE THE THING STOPPED
AS
TO THE SUFFERERS WHOSE SOLE INHERITANCE WAS LABOUR AND WHO HAD LOST
THAT INHERITANCE WHO COULD NOT GET WORK AND CONSEQUENTLY COULD NOT GET
WAGES AND CONSEQUENTLY COULD NOT GET BREAD THEY WERE LEFT TO SUFFER
ON PERHAPS INEVITABLY LEFT
IT WOULD NOT DO TO STOP THE PROGRESS OF
INVENTION TO DAMAGE SCIENCE BY DISCOURAGING ITS IMPROVEMENTS THE WAR
COULD NOT BE TERMINATED EFFICIENT RELIEF COULD NOT BE RAISED
THERE WAS
NO HELP THEN SO THE UNEMPLOYED UNDERWENT THEIR DESTINY ATE THE BREAD
AND DRANK THE WATERS OF AFFLICTION
MISERY GENERATES HATE
THESE SUFFERERS HATED THE MACHINES WHICH THEY
BELIEVED TOOK THEIR BREAD FROM THEM THEY HATED THE BUILDINGS WHICH
CONTAINED THOSE MACHINES THEY HATED THE MANUFACTURERS WHO OWNED THOSE
BUILDINGS
IN THE PARISH OF BRIARFIELD WITH WHICH WE HAVE AT PRESENT TO
DO HOLLOW'S MILL WAS THE PLACE HELD MOST ABOMINABLE GRARD MOORE IN
HIS DOUBLE CHARACTER OF SEMI FOREIGNER AND THOROUGH GOING PROGRESSIST
THE MAN MOST ABOMINATED
AND IT PERHAPS RATHER AGREED WITH MOORE'S
TEMPERAMENT THAN OTHERWISE TO BE GENERALLY HATED ESPECIALLY WHEN HE
BELIEVED THE THING FOR WHICH HE WAS HATED A RIGHT AND AN EXPEDIENT
THING AND IT WAS WITH A SENSE OF WARLIKE EXCITEMENT HE ON THIS NIGHT
SAT IN HIS COUNTING HOUSE WAITING THE ARRIVAL OF HIS FRAME LADEN WAGONS
MALONE'S COMING AND COMPANY WERE IT MAY BE MOST UNWELCOME TO HIM
HE
WOULD HAVE PREFERRED SITTING ALONE FOR HE LIKED A SILENT SOMBRE
UNSAFE SOLITUDE
HIS WATCHMAN'S MUSKET WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPANY ENOUGH
FOR HIM THE FULL FLOWING BECK IN THE DEN WOULD HAVE DELIVERED
CONTINUOUSLY THE DISCOURSE MOST GENIAL TO HIS EAR
WITH THE QUEEREST LOOK IN THE WORLD HAD THE MANUFACTURER FOR SOME TEN
MINUTES BEEN WATCHING THE IRISH CURATE AS THE LATTER MADE FREE WITH THE
PUNCH WHEN SUDDENLY THAT STEADY GRAY EYE CHANGED AS IF ANOTHER VISION
CAME BETWEEN IT AND MALONE
MOORE RAISED HIS HAND
CHUT HE SAID IN HIS FRENCH FASHION AS MALONE MADE A NOISE WITH HIS
GLASS
HE LISTENED A MOMENT THEN ROSE PUT HIS HAT ON AND WENT OUT AT
THE COUNTING HOUSE DOOR
THE NIGHT WAS STILL DARK AND STAGNANT THE WATER YET RUSHED ON FULL
AND FAST ITS FLOW ALMOST SEEMED A FLOOD IN THE UTTER SILENCE
MOORE'S
EAR HOWEVER CAUGHT ANOTHER SOUND VERY DISTANT BUT YET DISSIMILAR
BROKEN AND RUGGED IN SHORT A SOUND OF HEAVY WHEELS CRUNCHING A STONY
ROAD
HE RETURNED TO THE COUNTING HOUSE AND LIT A LANTERN WITH WHICH HE
WALKED DOWN THE MILL YARD AND PROCEEDED TO OPEN THE GATES
THE BIG
WAGONS WERE COMING ON THE DRAY HORSES' HUGE HOOFS WERE HEARD SPLASHING
IN THE MUD AND WATER
MOORE HAILED THEM
HEY JOE SCOTT IS ALL RIGHT
PROBABLY JOE SCOTT WAS YET AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE TO HEAR THE INQUIRY
HE DID NOT ANSWER IT
IS ALL RIGHT I SAY AGAIN ASKED MOORE WHEN THE ELEPHANT LIKE
LEADER'S NOSE ALMOST TOUCHED HIS
SOME ONE JUMPED OUT FROM THE FOREMOST WAGON INTO THE ROAD A VOICE CRIED
ALOUD AY AY DIVIL ALL'S RAIGHT WE'VE SMASHED 'EM
AND THERE WAS A RUN
THE WAGONS STOOD STILL THEY WERE NOW DESERTED
JOE SCOTT NO JOE SCOTT ANSWERED
MURGATROYD PIGHILLS SYKES NO
REPLY
MR
MOORE LIFTED HIS LANTERN AND LOOKED INTO THE VEHICLES
THERE
WAS NEITHER MAN NOR MACHINERY THEY WERE EMPTY AND ABANDONED
NOW MR
MOORE LOVED HIS MACHINERY
HE HAD RISKED THE LAST OF HIS CAPITAL
ON THE PURCHASE OF THESE FRAMES AND SHEARS WHICH TO NIGHT HAD BEEN
EXPECTED
SPECULATIONS MOST IMPORTANT TO HIS INTERESTS DEPENDED ON THE
RESULTS TO BE WROUGHT BY THEM
WHERE WERE THEY
THE WORDS WE'VE SMASHED 'EM RANG IN HIS EARS
HOW DID THE CATASTROPHE
AFFECT HIM BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN HE HELD WERE HIS FEATURES
VISIBLE RELAXING TO A SINGULAR SMILE THE SMILE THE MAN OF DETERMINED
SPIRIT WEARS WHEN HE REACHES A JUNCTURE IN HIS LIFE WHERE THIS
DETERMINED SPIRIT IS TO FEEL A DEMAND ON ITS STRENGTH WHEN THE STRAIN
IS TO BE MADE AND THE FACULTY MUST BEAR OR BREAK
YET HE REMAINED
SILENT AND EVEN MOTIONLESS FOR AT THE INSTANT HE NEITHER KNEW WHAT TO
SAY NOR WHAT TO DO
HE PLACED THE LANTERN ON THE GROUND AND STOOD WITH
HIS ARMS FOLDED GAZING DOWN AND REFLECTING
AN IMPATIENT TRAMPLING OF ONE OF THE HORSES MADE HIM PRESENTLY LOOK UP
HIS EYE IN THE MOMENT CAUGHT THE GLEAM OF SOMETHING WHITE ATTACHED TO A
PART OF THE HARNESS
EXAMINED BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN THIS PROVED TO
BE A FOLDED PAPER A BILLET
IT BORE NO ADDRESS WITHOUT WITHIN WAS THE
SUPERSCRIPTION
TO THE DIVIL OF HOLLOW'S MILN
WE WILL NOT COPY THE REST OF THE ORTHOGRAPHY WHICH WAS VERY PECULIAR
BUT TRANSLATE IT INTO LEGIBLE ENGLISH
IT RAN THUS
YOUR HELLISH MACHINERY IS SHIVERED TO SMASH ON STILBRO' MOOR AND YOUR
MEN ARE LYING BOUND HAND AND FOOT IN A DITCH BY THE ROADSIDE
TAKE THIS
AS A WARNING FROM MEN THAT ARE STARVING AND HAVE STARVING WIVES AND
CHILDREN TO GO HOME TO WHEN THEY HAVE DONE THIS DEED
IF YOU GET NEW
MACHINES OR IF YOU OTHERWISE GO ON AS YOU HAVE DONE YOU SHALL HEAR
FROM US AGAIN
BEWARE
HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN YES I'LL HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN AND YOU SHALL HEAR
FROM ME
I'LL SPEAK TO YOU DIRECTLY
ON STILBRO' MOOR YOU SHALL HEAR
FROM ME IN A MOMENT
HAVING LED THE WAGONS WITHIN THE GATES HE HASTENED TOWARDS THE COTTAGE
OPENING THE DOOR HE SPOKE A FEW WORDS QUICKLY BUT QUIETLY TO TWO
FEMALES WHO RAN TO MEET HIM IN THE PASSAGE
HE CALMED THE SEEMING ALARM
OF ONE BY A BRIEF PALLIATIVE ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE TO THE
OTHER HE SAID GO INTO THE MILL SARAH THERE IS THE KEY AND RING THE
MILL BELL AS LOUD AS YOU CAN
AFTERWARDS YOU WILL GET ANOTHER LANTERN
AND HELP ME TO LIGHT UP THE FRONT
RETURNING TO HIS HORSES HE UNHARNESSED FED AND STABLED THEM WITH
EQUAL SPEED AND CARE PAUSING OCCASIONALLY WHILE SO OCCUPIED AS IF TO
LISTEN FOR THE MILL BELL
IT CLANGED OUT PRESENTLY WITH IRREGULAR BUT
LOUD AND ALARMING DIN
THE HURRIED AGITATED PEAL SEEMED MORE URGENT
THAN IF THE SUMMONS HAD BEEN STEADILY GIVEN BY A PRACTISED HAND
ON THAT
STILL NIGHT AT THAT UNUSUAL HOUR IT WAS HEARD A LONG WAY ROUND
THE
GUESTS IN THE KITCHEN OF THE REDHOUSE WERE STARTLED BY THE CLAMOUR AND
DECLARING THAT THERE MUST BE SUMMAT MORE NOR COMMON TO DO AT HOLLOW'S
MILN THEY CALLED FOR LANTERNS AND HURRIED TO THE SPOT IN A BODY
AND
SCARCELY HAD THEY THRONGED INTO THE YARD WITH THEIR GLEAMING LIGHTS
WHEN THE TRAMP OF HORSES WAS HEARD AND A LITTLE MAN IN A SHOVEL HAT
SITTING ERECT ON THE BACK OF A SHAGGY PONY RODE LIGHTLY IN FOLLOWED
BY AN AIDE DE CAMP MOUNTED ON A LARGER STEED
MR
MOORE MEANTIME AFTER STABLING HIS DRAY HORSES HAD SADDLED HIS
HACKNEY AND WITH THE AID OF SARAH THE SERVANT LIT UP HIS MILL WHOSE
WIDE AND LONG FRONT NOW GLARED ONE GREAT ILLUMINATION THROWING A
SUFFICIENT LIGHT ON THE YARD TO OBVIATE ALL FEAR OF CONFUSION ARISING
FROM OBSCURITY
ALREADY A DEEP HUM OF VOICES BECAME AUDIBLE
MR
MALONE
HAD AT LENGTH ISSUED FROM THE COUNTING HOUSE PREVIOUSLY TAKING THE
PRECAUTION TO DIP HIS HEAD AND FACE IN THE STONE WATER JUG AND THIS
PRECAUTION TOGETHER WITH THE SUDDEN ALARM HAD NEARLY RESTORED TO HIM
THE POSSESSION OF THOSE SENSES WHICH THE PUNCH HAD PARTIALLY SCATTERED
HE STOOD WITH HIS HAT ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND HIS SHILLELAH GRASPED
IN HIS DEXTER FIST ANSWERING MUCH AT RANDOM THE QUESTIONS OF THE
NEWLY ARRIVED PARTY FROM THE REDHOUSE
MR
MOORE NOW APPEARED AND WAS
IMMEDIATELY CONFRONTED BY THE SHOVEL HAT AND THE SHAGGY PONY
WELL MOORE WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS WITH US I THOUGHT YOU WOULD WANT US
TO NIGHT ME AND THE HETMAN HERE PATTING HIS PONY'S NECK AND TOM AND
HIS CHARGER
WHEN I HEARD YOUR MILL BELL I COULD SIT STILL NO LONGER SO
I LEFT BOULTBY TO FINISH HIS SUPPER ALONE
BUT WHERE IS THE ENEMY I DO
NOT SEE A MASK OR A SMUTTED FACE PRESENT AND THERE IS NOT A PANE OF
GLASS BROKEN IN YOUR WINDOWS
HAVE YOU HAD AN ATTACK OR DO YOU EXPECT
ONE
OH NOT AT ALL I HAVE NEITHER HAD ONE NOR EXPECT ONE ANSWERED MOORE
COOLLY
I ONLY ORDERED THE BELL TO BE RUNG BECAUSE I WANT TWO OR THREE
NEIGHBOURS TO STAY HERE IN THE HOLLOW WHILE I AND A COUPLE OR SO MORE GO
OVER TO STILBRO' MOOR
TO STILBRO' MOOR WHAT TO DO TO MEET THE WAGONS
THE WAGONS ARE COME HOME AN HOUR AGO
THEN ALL'S RIGHT
WHAT MORE WOULD YOU HAVE
THEY CAME HOME EMPTY AND JOE SCOTT AND COMPANY ARE LEFT ON THE MOOR
AND SO ARE THE FRAMES
READ THAT SCRAWL
MR
HELSTONE RECEIVED AND PERUSED THE DOCUMENT OF WHICH THE CONTENTS
HAVE BEFORE BEEN GIVEN
HUM THEY'VE ONLY SERVED YOU AS THEY SERVE OTHERS
BUT HOWEVER THE
POOR FELLOWS IN THE DITCH WILL BE EXPECTING HELP WITH SOME IMPATIENCE
THIS IS A WET NIGHT FOR SUCH A BERTH
I AND TOM WILL GO WITH YOU
MALONE
MAY STAY BEHIND AND TAKE CARE OF THE MILL
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HIM
HIS EYES SEEM STARTING OUT OF HIS HEAD
HE HAS BEEN EATING A MUTTON CHOP
INDEED PETER AUGUSTUS BE ON YOUR GUARD
EAT NO MORE MUTTON CHOPS
TO NIGHT
YOU ARE LEFT HERE IN COMMAND OF THESE PREMISES AN HONOURABLE
POST
IS ANYBODY TO STAY WITH ME
AS MANY OF THE PRESENT ASSEMBLAGE AS CHOOSE MY LADS HOW MANY OF YOU
WILL REMAIN HERE AND HOW MANY WILL GO A LITTLE WAY WITH ME AND MR
MOORE ON THE STILBRO' ROAD TO MEET SOME MEN WHO HAVE BEEN WAYLAID AND
ASSAULTED BY FRAME BREAKERS
THE SMALL NUMBER OF THREE VOLUNTEERED TO GO THE REST PREFERRED STAYING
BEHIND
AS MR
MOORE MOUNTED HIS HORSE THE RECTOR ASKED HIM IN A LOW
VOICE WHETHER HE HAD LOCKED UP THE MUTTON CHOPS SO THAT PETER AUGUSTUS
COULD NOT GET AT THEM THE MANUFACTURER NODDED AN AFFIRMATIVE AND THE
RESCUE PARTY SET OUT
CHAPTER III
MR
YORKE
CHEERFULNESS IT WOULD APPEAR IS A MATTER WHICH DEPENDS FULLY AS MUCH
ON THE STATE OF THINGS WITHIN AS ON THE STATE OF THINGS WITHOUT AND
AROUND US
I MAKE THIS TRITE REMARK BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT
MESSRS
HELSTONE AND MOORE TROTTED FORTH FROM THE MILL YARD GATES AT
THE HEAD OF THEIR VERY SMALL COMPANY IN THE BEST POSSIBLE SPIRITS
WHEN
A RAY FROM A LANTERN THE THREE PEDESTRIANS OF THE PARTY CARRIED EACH
ONE FELL ON MR
MOORE'S FACE YOU COULD SEE AN UNUSUAL BECAUSE A
LIVELY SPARK DANCING IN HIS EYES AND A NEW FOUND VIVACITY MANTLING ON
HIS DARK PHYSIOGNOMY AND WHEN THE RECTOR'S VISAGE WAS ILLUMINATED HIS
HARD FEATURES WERE REVEALED ALL AGRIN AND ASHINE WITH GLEE
YET A
DRIZZLING NIGHT A SOMEWHAT PERILOUS EXPEDITION YOU WOULD THINK WERE
NOT CIRCUMSTANCES CALCULATED TO ENLIVEN THOSE EXPOSED TO THE WET AND
ENGAGED IN THE ADVENTURE
IF ANY MEMBER OR MEMBERS OF THE CREW WHO HAD
BEEN AT WORK ON STILBRO' MOOR HAD CAUGHT A VIEW OF THIS PARTY THEY
WOULD HAVE HAD GREAT PLEASURE IN SHOOTING EITHER OF THE LEADERS FROM
BEHIND A WALL AND THE LEADERS KNEW THIS AND THE FACT IS BEING BOTH
MEN OF STEELY NERVES AND STEADY BEATING HEARTS WERE ELATE WITH THE
KNOWLEDGE
I AM AWARE READER AND YOU NEED NOT REMIND ME THAT IT IS A DREADFUL
THING FOR A PARSON TO BE WARLIKE I AM AWARE THAT HE SHOULD BE A MAN OF
PEACE
I HAVE SOME FAINT OUTLINE OF AN IDEA OF WHAT A CLERGYMAN'S
MISSION IS AMONGST MANKIND AND I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY WHOSE SERVANT HE
IS WHOSE MESSAGE HE DELIVERS WHOSE EXAMPLE HE SHOULD FOLLOW YET WITH
ALL THIS IF YOU ARE A PARSON HATER YOU NEED NOT EXPECT ME TO GO ALONG
WITH YOU EVERY STEP OF YOUR DISMAL DOWNWARD TENDING UNCHRISTIAN ROAD
YOU NEED NOT EXPECT ME TO JOIN IN YOUR DEEP ANATHEMAS AT ONCE SO NARROW
AND SO SWEEPING IN YOUR POISONOUS RANCOUR SO INTENSE AND SO ABSURD
AGAINST THE CLOTH TO LIFT UP MY EYES AND HANDS WITH A SUPPLEHOUGH
OR TO INFLATE MY LUNGS WITH A BARRACLOUGH IN HORROR AND DENUNCIATION OF
THE DIABOLICAL RECTOR OF BRIARFIELD
HE WAS NOT DIABOLICAL AT ALL
THE EVIL SIMPLY WAS HE HAD MISSED HIS
VOCATION
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SOLDIER AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAD MADE HIM
A PRIEST
FOR THE REST HE WAS A CONSCIENTIOUS HARD HEADED
HARD HANDED BRAVE STERN IMPLACABLE FAITHFUL LITTLE MAN A MAN ALMOST
WITHOUT SYMPATHY UNGENTLE PREJUDICED AND RIGID BUT A MAN TRUE TO
PRINCIPLE HONOURABLE SAGACIOUS AND SINCERE
IT SEEMS TO ME READER
THAT YOU CANNOT ALWAYS CUT OUT MEN TO FIT THEIR PROFESSION AND THAT YOU
OUGHT NOT TO CURSE THEM BECAUSE THEIR PROFESSION SOMETIMES HANGS ON THEM
UNGRACEFULLY
NOR WILL I CURSE HELSTONE CLERICAL COSSACK AS HE WAS
YET
HE WAS CURSED AND BY MANY OF HIS OWN PARISHIONERS AS BY OTHERS HE
WAS ADORED WHICH IS THE FREQUENT FATE OF MEN WHO SHOW PARTIALITY IN
FRIENDSHIP AND BITTERNESS IN ENMITY WHO ARE EQUALLY ATTACHED TO
PRINCIPLES AND ADHERENT TO PREJUDICES
HELSTONE AND MOORE BEING BOTH IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS AND UNITED FOR THE
PRESENT IN ONE CAUSE YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT AS THEY RODE SIDE BY SIDE
THEY WOULD CONVERSE AMICABLY
OH NO THESE TWO MEN OF HARD BILIOUS
NATURES BOTH RARELY CAME INTO CONTACT BUT THEY CHAFED EACH OTHER'S
MOODS
THEIR FREQUENT BONE OF CONTENTION WAS THE WAR
HELSTONE WAS A
HIGH TORY THERE WERE TORIES IN THOSE DAYS AND MOORE WAS A BITTER
WHIG A WHIG AT LEAST AS FAR AS OPPOSITION TO THE WAR PARTY WAS
CONCERNED THAT BEING THE QUESTION WHICH AFFECTED HIS OWN INTEREST AND
ONLY ON THAT QUESTION DID HE PROFESS ANY BRITISH POLITICS AT ALL
HE
LIKED TO INFURIATE HELSTONE BY DECLARING HIS BELIEF IN THE INVINCIBILITY
OF BONAPARTE BY TAUNTING ENGLAND AND EUROPE WITH THE IMPOTENCE OF THEIR
EFFORTS TO WITHSTAND HIM AND BY COOLLY ADVANCING THE OPINION THAT IT
WAS AS WELL TO YIELD TO HIM SOON AS LATE SINCE HE MUST IN THE END CRUSH
EVERY ANTAGONIST AND REIGN SUPREME
HELSTONE COULD NOT BEAR THESE SENTIMENTS
IT WAS ONLY ON THE
CONSIDERATION OF MOORE BEING A SORT OF OUTCAST AND ALIEN AND HAVING BUT
HALF MEASURE OF BRITISH BLOOD TO TEMPER THE FOREIGN GALL WHICH CORRODED
HIS VEINS THAT HE BROUGHT HIMSELF TO LISTEN TO THEM WITHOUT INDULGING
THE WISH HE FELT TO CANE THE SPEAKER
ANOTHER THING TOO SOMEWHAT
ALLAYED HIS DISGUST NAMELY A FELLOW FEELING FOR THE DOGGED TONE WITH
WHICH THESE OPINIONS WERE ASSERTED AND A RESPECT FOR THE CONSISTENCY
OF MOORE'S CRABBED CONTUMACY
AS THE PARTY TURNED INTO THE STILBRO' ROAD THEY MET WHAT LITTLE WIND
THERE WAS THE RAIN DASHED IN THEIR FACES
MOORE HAD BEEN FRETTING HIS
COMPANION PREVIOUSLY AND NOW BRACED UP BY THE RAW BREEZE AND PERHAPS
IRRITATED BY THE SHARP DRIZZLE HE BEGAN TO GOAD HIM
DOES YOUR PENINSULAR NEWS PLEASE YOU STILL HE ASKED
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WAS THE SURLY DEMAND OF THE RECTOR
I MEAN HAVE YOU STILL FAITH IN THAT BAAL OF A LORD WELLINGTON
AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOW
DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT THIS WOODEN FACED AND PEBBLE HEARTED IDOL OF
ENGLAND HAS POWER TO SEND FIRE DOWN FROM HEAVEN TO CONSUME THE FRENCH
HOLOCAUST YOU WANT TO OFFER UP
I BELIEVE WELLINGTON WILL FLOG BONAPARTE'S MARSHALS INTO THE SEA THE
DAY IT PLEASES HIM TO LIFT HIS ARM
BUT MY DEAR SIR YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS IN WHAT YOU SAY
BONAPARTE'S
MARSHALS ARE GREAT MEN WHO ACT UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF AN OMNIPOTENT
MASTER SPIRIT
YOUR WELLINGTON IS THE MOST HUMDRUM OF COMMONPLACE
MARTINETS WHOSE SLOW MECHANICAL MOVEMENTS ARE FURTHER CRAMPED BY AN
IGNORANT HOME GOVERNMENT
WELLINGTON IS THE SOUL OF ENGLAND
WELLINGTON IS THE RIGHT CHAMPION OF
A GOOD CAUSE THE FIT REPRESENTATIVE OF A POWERFUL A RESOLUTE A
SENSIBLE AND AN HONEST NATION
YOUR GOOD CAUSE AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS SIMPLY THE RESTORATION
OF THAT FILTHY FEEBLE FERDINAND TO A THRONE WHICH HE DISGRACED
YOUR
FIT REPRESENTATIVE OF AN HONEST PEOPLE IS A DULL WITTED DROVER ACTING
FOR A DULLER WITTED FARMER AND AGAINST THESE ARE ARRAYED VICTORIOUS
SUPREMACY AND INVINCIBLE GENIUS
AGAINST LEGITIMACY IS ARRAYED USURPATION AGAINST MODEST
SINGLE MINDED RIGHTEOUS AND BRAVE RESISTANCE TO ENCROACHMENT IS
ARRAYED BOASTFUL DOUBLE TONGUED SELFISH AND TREACHEROUS AMBITION TO
POSSESS
GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT
GOD OFTEN DEFENDS THE POWERFUL
WHAT I SUPPOSE THE HANDFUL OF ISRAELITES STANDING DRYSHOD ON THE
ASIATIC SIDE OF THE RED SEA WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE HOST OF THE
EGYPTIANS DRAWN UP ON THE AFRICAN SIDE WERE THEY MORE NUMEROUS WERE
THEY BETTER APPOINTED WERE THEY MORE MIGHTY IN A WORD EH DON'T
SPEAK OR YOU'LL TELL A LIE MOORE YOU KNOW YOU WILL
THEY WERE A POOR
OVERWROUGHT BAND OF BONDSMEN
TYRANTS HAD OPPRESSED THEM THROUGH FOUR
HUNDRED YEARS A FEEBLE MIXTURE OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN DILUTED THEIR THIN
RANKS THEIR MASTERS WHO ROARED TO FOLLOW THEM THROUGH THE DIVIDED
FLOOD WERE A SET OF PAMPERED ETHIOPS ABOUT AS STRONG AND BRUTAL AS THE
LIONS OF LIBYA
THEY WERE ARMED HORSED AND CHARIOTED THE POOR HEBREW
WANDERERS WERE AFOOT
FEW OF THEM IT IS LIKELY HAD BETTER WEAPONS THAN
THEIR SHEPHERDS' CROOKS OR THEIR MASONS' BUILDING TOOLS THEIR MEEK AND
MIGHTY LEADER HIMSELF HAD ONLY HIS ROD
BUT BETHINK YOU ROBERT MOORE
RIGHT WAS WITH THEM THE GOD OF BATTLES WAS ON THEIR SIDE
CRIME AND THE
LOST ARCHANGEL GENERALLED THE RANKS OF PHARAOH AND WHICH TRIUMPHED WE
KNOW THAT WELL
'THE LORD SAVED ISRAEL THAT DAY OUT OF THE HAND OF THE
EGYPTIANS AND ISRAEL SAW THE EGYPTIANS DEAD UPON THE SEA SHORE' YEA
'THE DEPTHS COVERED THEM THEY SANK TO THE BOTTOM AS A STONE THE RIGHT
HAND OF THE LORD BECAME GLORIOUS IN POWER THE RIGHT HAND OF THE LORD
DASHED IN PIECES THE ENEMY
YOU ARE ALL RIGHT ONLY YOU FORGET THE TRUE PARALLEL
FRANCE IS ISRAEL
AND NAPOLEON IS MOSES
EUROPE WITH HER OLD OVERGORGED EMPIRES AND
ROTTEN DYNASTIES IS CORRUPT EGYPT GALLANT FRANCE IS THE TWELVE TRIBES
AND HER FRESH AND VIGOROUS USURPER THE SHEPHERD OF HOREB
I SCORN TO ANSWER YOU
MOORE ACCORDINGLY ANSWERED HIMSELF AT LEAST HE SUBJOINED TO WHAT HE
HAD JUST SAID AN ADDITIONAL OBSERVATION IN A LOWER VOICE
OH IN ITALY HE WAS AS GREAT AS ANY MOSES HE WAS THE RIGHT THING
THERE FIT TO HEAD AND ORGANIZE MEASURES FOR THE REGENERATION OF
NATIONS
IT PUZZLES ME TO THIS DAY HOW THE CONQUEROR OF LODI SHOULD HAVE
CONDESCENDED TO BECOME AN EMPEROR A VULGAR A STUPID HUMBUG AND STILL
MORE HOW A PEOPLE WHO HAD ONCE CALLED THEMSELVES REPUBLICANS SHOULD HAVE
SUNK AGAIN TO THE GRADE OF MERE SLAVES
I DESPISE FRANCE IF ENGLAND HAD
GONE AS FAR ON THE MARCH OF CIVILIZATION AS FRANCE DID SHE WOULD HARDLY
HAVE RETREATED SO SHAMELESSLY
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT BESOTTED IMPERIAL FRANCE IS ANY WORSE THAN
BLOODY REPUBLICAN FRANCE DEMANDED HELSTONE FIERCELY
I MEAN TO SAY NOTHING BUT I CAN THINK WHAT I PLEASE YOU KNOW MR
HELSTONE BOTH ABOUT FRANCE AND ENGLAND AND ABOUT REVOLUTIONS AND
REGICIDES AND RESTORATIONS IN GENERAL AND ABOUT THE DIVINE RIGHT OF
KINGS WHICH YOU OFTEN STICKLE FOR IN YOUR SERMONS AND THE DUTY OF
NON RESISTANCE AND THE SANITY OF WAR AND
MR
MOORE'S SENTENCE WAS HERE CUT SHORT BY THE RAPID ROLLING UP OF A
GIG AND ITS SUDDEN STOPPAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
BOTH HE AND THE
RECTOR HAD BEEN TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THEIR DISCOURSE TO NOTICE ITS
APPROACH TILL IT WAS CLOSE UPON THEM
NAH MAISTER DID TH' WAGONS HIT HOME DEMANDED A VOICE FROM THE
VEHICLE
CAN THAT BE JOE SCOTT
AY AY RETURNED ANOTHER VOICE FOR THE GIG CONTAINED TWO PERSONS AS
WAS SEEN BY THE GLIMMER OF ITS LAMP
THE MEN WITH THE LANTERNS HAD NOW
FALLEN INTO THE REAR OR RATHER THE EQUESTRIANS OF THE RESCUE PARTY HAD
OUTRIDDEN THE PEDESTRIANS
AY MR
MOORE IT'S JOE SCOTT
I'M BRINGING
HIM BACK TO YOU IN A BONNY PICKLE
I FAND HIM ON THE TOP OF THE MOOR
YONDER HIM AND THREE OTHERS
WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR RESTORING HIM TO
YOU
WHY MY THANKS I BELIEVE FOR I COULD BETTER HAVE AFFORDED TO LOSE A
BETTER MAN
THAT IS YOU I SUPPOSE MR
YORKE BY YOUR VOICE
AY LAD IT'S ME
I WAS COMING HOME FROM STILBRO' MARKET AND JUST AS I
GOT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE MOOR AND WAS WHIPPING ON AS SWIFT AS THE WIND
FOR THESE THEY SAY ARE NOT SAFE TIMES THANKS TO A BAD GOVERNMENT
I HEARD A GROAN
I PULLED UP
SOME WOULD HAVE WHIPT ON FASTER BUT I'VE
NAUGHT TO FEAR THAT I KNOW OF
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A LAD IN THESE
PARTS WOULD HARM ME AT LEAST I'D GIVE THEM AS GOOD AS I GOT IF THEY
OFFERED TO DO IT
I SAID 'IS THERE AUGHT WRONG ANYWHERE ''DEED IS
THERE SOMEBODY SAYS SPEAKING OUT OF THE GROUND LIKE
'WHAT'S TO DO
BE SHARP AND TELL ME I ORDERED
'NOBBUT FOUR ON US LIGGING IN A
DITCH SAYS JOE AS QUIET AS COULD BE
I TELLED 'EM MORE SHAME TO 'EM
AND BID THEM GET UP AND MOVE ON OR I'D LEND THEM A LICK OF THE
GIG WHIP FOR MY NOTION WAS THEY WERE ALL FRESH
'WE'D HA' DONE THAT AN
HOUR SIN' BUT WE'RE TEED WI' A BIT O' BAND SAYS JOE
SO IN A WHILE I
GOT DOWN AND LOOSED 'EM WI' MY PENKNIFE AND SCOTT WOULD RIDE WI' ME TO
TELL ME ALL HOW IT HAPPENED AND T' OTHERS ARE COMING ON AS FAST AS
THEIR FEET WILL BRING THEM
WELL I AM GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU MR
YORKE
ARE YOU MY LAD YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
HOWEVER HERE ARE THE REST
APPROACHING
AND HERE BY THE LORD IS ANOTHER SET WITH LIGHTS IN THEIR
PITCHERS LIKE THE ARMY OF GIDEON AND AS WE'VE TH' PARSON WI'
US GOOD EVENING MR
HELSTONE WE'SE DO
MR
HELSTONE RETURNED THE SALUTATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE GIG VERY
STIFFLY INDEED
THAT INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDED
WE'RE ELEVEN STRONG MEN AND THERE'S BOTH HORSES AND CHARIOTS AMANG US
IF WE COULD ONLY FALL IN WI' SOME OF THESE STARVED RAGAMUFFINS OF
FRAME BREAKERS WE COULD WIN A GRAND VICTORY
WE COULD IV'RY ONE BE A
WELLINGTON THAT WOULD PLEASE YE MR
HELSTONE AND SICH PARAGRAPHS AS
WE COULD CONTRIVE FOR T' PAPERS BRIARFIELD SULD BE FAMOUS
BUT WE'SE
HEV A COLUMN AND A HALF I' TH' STILBRO' COURIER OWER THIS JOB AS IT
IS I DARE SAY
I'SE EXPECT NO LESS
AND I'LL PROMISE YOU NO LESS MR
YORKE FOR I'LL WRITE THE ARTICLE
MYSELF RETURNED THE RECTOR
TO BE SURE SARTAINLY AND MIND YE RECOMMEND WEEL THAT THEM 'AT BRAKE
T' BITS O' FRAMES AND TEED JOE SCOTT'S LEGS WI' BAND SULD BE HUNG
WITHOUT BENEFIT O' CLERGY
IT'S A HANGING MATTER OR SULD BE
NO DOUBT
O' THAT
IF I JUDGED THEM I'D GIVE THEM SHORT SHRIFT CRIED MOORE
BUT I MEAN
TO LET THEM QUITE ALONE THIS BOUT TO GIVE THEM ROPE ENOUGH CERTAIN
THAT IN THE END THEY WILL HANG THEMSELVES
LET THEM ALONE WILL YE MOORE DO YOU PROMISE THAT
PROMISE NO
ALL I MEAN TO SAY IS I SHALL GIVE MYSELF NO PARTICULAR
TROUBLE TO CATCH THEM BUT IF ONE FALLS IN MY WAY
YOU'LL SNAP HIM UP OF COURSE
ONLY YOU WOULD RATHER THEY WOULD DO
SOMETHING WORSE THAN MERELY STOP A WAGON BEFORE YOU RECKON WITH THEM
WELL WE'LL SAY NO MORE ON THE SUBJECT AT PRESENT
HERE WE ARE AT MY
DOOR GENTLEMEN AND I HOPE YOU AND THE MEN WILL STEP IN
YOU WILL NONE
OF YOU BE THE WORSE OF A LITTLE REFRESHMENT
MOORE AND HELSTONE OPPOSED THIS PROPOSITION AS UNNECESSARY
IT WAS
HOWEVER PRESSED ON THEM SO COURTEOUSLY AND THE NIGHT BESIDES WAS SO
INCLEMENT AND THE GLEAM FROM THE MUSLIN CURTAINED WINDOWS OF THE HOUSE
BEFORE WHICH THEY HAD HALTED LOOKED SO INVITING THAT AT LENGTH THEY
YIELDED
MR
YORKE AFTER HAVING ALIGHTED FROM HIS GIG WHICH HE LEFT IN
CHARGE OF A MAN WHO ISSUED FROM AN OUTBUILDING ON HIS ARRIVAL LED THE
WAY IN
IT WILL HAVE BEEN REMARKED THAT MR
YORKE VARIED A LITTLE IN HIS
PHRASEOLOGY
NOW HE SPOKE BROAD YORKSHIRE AND ANON HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF
IN VERY PURE ENGLISH
HIS MANNER SEEMED LIABLE TO EQUAL ALTERNATIONS
HE
COULD BE POLITE AND AFFABLE AND HE COULD BE BLUNT AND ROUGH
HIS
STATION THEN YOU COULD NOT EASILY DETERMINE BY HIS SPEECH AND DEMEANOUR
PERHAPS THE APPEARANCE OF HIS RESIDENCE MAY DECIDE IT
THE MEN HE RECOMMENDED TO TAKE THE KITCHEN WAY SAYING THAT HE WOULD
SEE THEM SERVED WI' SUMMAT TO TASTE PRESENTLY THE GENTLEMEN WERE
USHERED IN AT THE FRONT ENTRANCE
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MATTED
HALL LINED ALMOST TO THE CEILING WITH PICTURES
THROUGH THIS THEY WERE
CONDUCTED TO A LARGE PARLOUR WITH A MAGNIFICENT FIRE IN THE GRATE THE
MOST CHEERFUL OF ROOMS IT APPEARED AS A WHOLE AND WHEN YOU CAME TO
EXAMINE DETAILS THE ENLIVENING EFFECT WAS NOT DIMINISHED
THERE WAS NO
SPLENDOUR BUT THERE WAS TASTE EVERYWHERE UNUSUAL TASTE THE TASTE YOU
WOULD HAVE SAID OF A TRAVELLED MAN A SCHOLAR AND A GENTLEMAN
A
SERIES OF ITALIAN VIEWS DECKED THE WALLS
EACH OF THESE WAS A SPECIMEN
OF TRUE ART
A CONNOISSEUR HAD SELECTED THEM THEY WERE GENUINE AND
VALUABLE
EVEN BY CANDLE LIGHT THE BRIGHT CLEAR SKIES THE SOFT
DISTANCES WITH BLUE AIR QUIVERING BETWEEN THE EYE AND THE HILLS THE
FRESH TINTS AND WELL MASSED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS CHARMED THE VIEW
THE
SUBJECTS WERE ALL PASTORAL THE SCENES WERE ALL SUNNY
THERE WAS A
GUITAR AND SOME MUSIC ON A SOFA THERE WERE CAMEOS BEAUTIFUL
MINIATURES A SET OF GRECIAN LOOKING VASES ON THE MANTELPIECE THERE
WERE BOOKS WELL ARRANGED IN TWO ELEGANT BOOKCASES
MR
YORKE BADE HIS GUESTS BE SEATED
HE THEN RANG FOR WINE
TO THE
SERVANT WHO BROUGHT IT HE GAVE HOSPITABLE ORDERS FOR THE REFRESHMENT OF
THE MEN IN THE KITCHEN
THE RECTOR REMAINED STANDING HE SEEMED NOT TO
LIKE HIS QUARTERS HE WOULD NOT TOUCH THE WINE HIS HOST OFFERED HIM
E'EN AS YOU WILL REMARKED MR
YORKE
I RECKON YOU'RE THINKING OF
EASTERN CUSTOMS MR
HELSTONE AND YOU'LL NOT EAT NOR DRINK UNDER MY
ROOF FEARED WE SULD BE FORCED TO BE FRIENDS BUT I AM NOT SO PARTICULAR
OR SUPERSTITIOUS
YOU MIGHT SUP THE CONTENTS OF THAT DECANTER AND YOU
MIGHT GIVE ME A BOTTLE OF THE BEST IN YOUR OWN CELLAR AND I'D HOLD
MYSELF FREE TO OPPOSE YOU AT EVERY TURN STILL IN EVERY VESTRY MEETING
AND JUSTICE MEETING WHERE WE ENCOUNTERED ONE ANOTHER
IT IS JUST WHAT I SHOULD EXPECT OF YOU MR
YORKE
DOES IT AGREE WI' YE NOW MR
HELSTONE TO BE RIDING OUT AFTER RIOTERS
OF A WET NIGHT AT YOUR AGE
IT ALWAYS AGREES WITH ME TO BE DOING MY DUTY AND IN THIS CASE MY DUTY
IS A THOROUGH PLEASURE
TO HUNT DOWN VERMIN IS A NOBLE OCCUPATION FIT
FOR AN ARCHBISHOP
FIT FOR YE AT ONY RATE
BUT WHERE'S T' CURATE HE'S HAPPEN GONE TO
VISIT SOME POOR BODY IN A SICK GIRD OR HE'S HAPPEN HUNTING DOWN VERMIN
IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
HE IS DOING GARRISON DUTY AT HOLLOW'S MILL
YOU LEFT HIM A SUP O' WINE I HOPE BOB TURNING TO MR
MOORE TO
KEEP HIS COURAGE UP
HE DID NOT PAUSE FOR AN ANSWER BUT CONTINUED QUICKLY STILL ADDRESSING
MOORE WHO HAD THROWN HIMSELF INTO AN OLD FASHIONED CHAIR BY THE
FIRESIDE MOVE IT ROBERT GET UP MY LAD THAT PLACE IS MINE
TAKE THE
SOFA OR THREE OTHER CHAIRS IF YOU WILL BUT NOT THIS
IT BELANGS TO
ME AND NOB'DY ELSE
WHY ARE YOU SO PARTICULAR TO THAT CHAIR MR
YORKE ASKED MOORE
LAZILY VACATING THE PLACE IN OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS
MY FATHER WAR AFORE ME AND THAT'S ALL T' ANSWER I SALL GIE THEE AND
IT'S AS GOOD A REASON AS MR
HELSTONE CAN GIVE FOR THE MAIN FECK O' HIS
NOTIONS
MOORE ARE YOU READY TO GO INQUIRED THE RECTOR
NAY ROBERT'S NOT READY OR RATHER I'M NOT READY TO PART WI' HIM
HE'S
AN ILL LAD AND WANTS CORRECTING
WHY SIR WHAT HAVE I DONE
MADE THYSELF ENEMIES ON EVERY HAND
WHAT DO I CARE FOR THAT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE TO ME WHETHER
YOUR YORKSHIRE LOUTS HATE ME OR LIKE ME
AY THERE IT IS
THE LAD IS A MAK' OF AN ALIEN AMANG US
HIS FATHER
WOULD NEVER HAVE TALKED I' THAT WAY GO BACK TO ANTWERP WHERE YOU WERE
BORN AND BRED MAUVAISE TTE
MAUVAISE TTE VOUS MME JE NE FAIS QUE MON DEVOIR QUANT VOS
LOURDAUDS DE PAYSANS JE M'EN MOQUE

YORKE CE MOT AMI M'IRRITE TROP NE M'EN PARLEZ PLUS
COMME TU VOUDRAS
AND HERE MR
YORKE HELD HIS PEACE AND WHILE HE SITS LEANING BACK IN HIS
THREE CORNERED CARVED OAK CHAIR I WILL SNATCH MY OPPORTUNITY TO SKETCH
THE PORTRAIT OF THIS FRENCH SPEAKING YORKSHIRE GENTLEMAN
CHAPTER IV
MR
YORKE CONTINUED
A YORKSHIRE GENTLEMAN HE WAS PAR EXCELLENCE IN EVERY POINT ABOUT
FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD BUT LOOKING AT FIRST SIGHT STILL OLDER FOR HIS
HAIR WAS SILVER WHITE
HIS FOREHEAD WAS BROAD NOT HIGH HIS FACE FRESH
AND HALE THE HARSHNESS OF THE NORTH WAS SEEN IN HIS FEATURES AS IT WAS
HEARD IN HIS VOICE EVERY TRAIT WAS THOROUGHLY ENGLISH NOT A NORMAN
LINE ANYWHERE IT WAS AN INELEGANT UNCLASSIC UNARISTOCRATIC MOULD OF
VISAGE
FINE PEOPLE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE CALLED IT VULGAR SENSIBLE PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE TERMED IT CHARACTERISTIC SHREWD PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED
IN IT FOR THE PITH SAGACITY INTELLIGENCE THE RUDE YET REAL
ORIGINALITY MARKED IN EVERY LINEAMENT LATENT IN EVERY FURROW
BUT IT
WAS AN INDOCILE A SCORNFUL AND A SARCASTIC FACE THE FACE OF A MAN
DIFFICULT TO LEAD AND IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE
HIS STATURE WAS RATHER TALL
AND HE WAS WELL MADE AND WIRY AND HAD A STATELY INTEGRITY OF PORT
THERE WAS NOT A SUSPICION OF THE CLOWN ABOUT HIM ANYWHERE
I DID NOT FIND IT EASY TO SKETCH MR
YORKE'S PERSON BUT IT IS MORE
DIFFICULT TO INDICATE HIS MIND
IF YOU EXPECT TO BE TREATED TO A
PERFECTION READER OR EVEN TO A BENEVOLENT PHILANTHROPIC OLD GENTLEMAN
IN HIM YOU ARE MISTAKEN
HE HAS SPOKEN WITH SOME SENSE AND WITH SOME
GOOD FEELING TO MR
MOORE BUT YOU ARE NOT THENCE TO CONCLUDE THAT HE
ALWAYS SPOKE AND THOUGHT JUSTLY AND KINDLY
MR
YORKE IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS WITHOUT THE ORGAN OF VENERATION A
GREAT WANT AND WHICH THROWS A MAN WRONG ON EVERY POINT WHERE VENERATION
IS REQUIRED
SECONDLY HE WAS WITHOUT THE ORGAN OF COMPARISON A
DEFICIENCY WHICH STRIPS A MAN OF SYMPATHY AND THIRDLY HE HAD TOO
LITTLE OF THE ORGANS OF BENEVOLENCE AND IDEALITY WHICH TOOK THE GLORY
AND SOFTNESS FROM HIS NATURE AND FOR HIM DIMINISHED THOSE DIVINE
QUALITIES THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE
THE WANT OF VENERATION MADE HIM INTOLERANT TO THOSE ABOVE HIM KINGS AND
NOBLES AND PRIESTS DYNASTIES AND PARLIAMENTS AND ESTABLISHMENTS WITH
ALL THEIR DOINGS MOST OF THEIR ENACTMENTS THEIR FORMS THEIR RIGHTS
THEIR CLAIMS WERE TO HIM AN ABOMINATION ALL RUBBISH HE FOUND NO USE
OR PLEASURE IN THEM AND BELIEVED IT WOULD BE CLEAR GAIN AND NO DAMAGE
TO THE WORLD IF ITS HIGH PLACES WERE RAZED AND THEIR OCCUPANTS CRUSHED
IN THE FALL
THE WANT OF VENERATION TOO MADE HIM DEAD AT HEART TO THE
ELECTRIC DELIGHT OF ADMIRING WHAT IS ADMIRABLE IT DRIED UP A THOUSAND
PURE SOURCES OF ENJOYMENT IT WITHERED A THOUSAND VIVID PLEASURES
HE
WAS NOT IRRELIGIOUS THOUGH A MEMBER OF NO SECT BUT HIS RELIGION COULD
NOT BE THAT OF ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO VENERATE
HE BELIEVED IN GOD AND
HEAVEN BUT HIS GOD AND HEAVEN WERE THOSE OF A MAN IN WHOM AWE
IMAGINATION AND TENDERNESS LACK
THE WEAKNESS OF HIS POWERS OF COMPARISON MADE HIM INCONSISTENT WHILE HE
PROFESSED SOME EXCELLENT GENERAL DOCTRINES OF MUTUAL TOLERATION AND
FORBEARANCE HE CHERISHED TOWARDS CERTAIN CLASSES A BIGOTED ANTIPATHY
HE SPOKE OF PARSONS AND ALL WHO BELONGED TO PARSONS OF LORDS AND
THE APPENDAGES OF LORDS WITH A HARSHNESS SOMETIMES AN INSOLENCE AS
UNJUST AS IT WAS INSUFFERABLE
HE COULD NOT PLACE HIMSELF IN THE
POSITION OF THOSE HE VITUPERATED HE COULD NOT COMPARE THEIR ERRORS WITH
THEIR TEMPTATIONS THEIR DEFECTS WITH THEIR DISADVANTAGES HE COULD NOT
REALIZE THE EFFECT OF SUCH AND SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES ON HIMSELF SIMILARLY
SITUATED AND HE WOULD OFTEN EXPRESS THE MOST FEROCIOUS AND TYRANNICAL
WISHES REGARDING THOSE WHO HAD ACTED AS HE THOUGHT FEROCIOUSLY AND
TYRANNICALLY
TO JUDGE BY HIS THREATS HE WOULD HAVE EMPLOYED ARBITRARY
EVEN CRUEL MEANS TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM AND EQUALITY
EQUALITY YES MR
YORKE TALKED ABOUT EQUALITY BUT AT HEART HE WAS A
PROUD MAN VERY FRIENDLY TO HIS WORKPEOPLE VERY GOOD TO ALL WHO WERE
BENEATH HIM AND SUBMITTED QUIETLY TO BE BENEATH HIM BUT HAUGHTY AS
BEELZEBUB TO WHOMSOEVER THE WORLD DEEMED FOR HE DEEMED NO MAN HIS
SUPERIOR
REVOLT WAS IN HIS BLOOD HE COULD NOT BEAR CONTROL HIS
FATHER HIS GRANDFATHER BEFORE HIM COULD NOT BEAR IT AND HIS CHILDREN
AFTER HIM NEVER COULD
THE WANT OF GENERAL BENEVOLENCE MADE HIM VERY IMPATIENT OF IMBECILITY
AND OF ALL FAULTS WHICH GRATED ON HIS STRONG SHREWD NATURE IT LEFT NO
CHECK TO HIS CUTTING SARCASM
AS HE WAS NOT MERCIFUL HE WOULD SOMETIMES
WOUND AND WOUND AGAIN WITHOUT NOTICING HOW MUCH HE HURT OR CARING HOW
DEEP HE THRUST
AS TO THE PAUCITY OF IDEALITY IN HIS MIND THAT CAN SCARCELY BE CALLED A
FAULT A FINE EAR FOR MUSIC A CORRECT EYE FOR COLOUR AND FORM LEFT HIM
THE QUALITY OF TASTE AND WHO CARES FOR IMAGINATION WHO DOES NOT THINK
IT A RATHER DANGEROUS SENSELESS ATTRIBUTE AKIN TO WEAKNESS PERHAPS
PARTAKING OF FRENZY A DISEASE RATHER THAN A GIFT OF THE MIND
PROBABLY ALL THINK IT SO BUT THOSE WHO POSSESS OR FANCY THEY POSSESS
IT
TO HEAR THEM SPEAK YOU WOULD BELIEVE THAT THEIR HEARTS WOULD BE
COLD IF THAT ELIXIR DID NOT FLOW ABOUT THEM THAT THEIR EYES WOULD BE
DIM IF THAT FLAME DID NOT REFINE THEIR VISION THAT THEY WOULD BE LONELY
IF THIS STRANGE COMPANION ABANDONED THEM
YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THAT IT
IMPARTED SOME GLAD HOPE TO SPRING SOME FINE CHARM TO SUMMER SOME
TRANQUIL JOY TO AUTUMN SOME CONSOLATION TO WINTER WHICH YOU DO NOT
FEEL
AN ILLUSION OF COURSE BUT THE FANATICS CLING TO THEIR DREAM AND
WOULD NOT GIVE IT FOR GOLD
AS MR
YORKE DID NOT POSSESS POETIC IMAGINATION HIMSELF HE CONSIDERED
IT A MOST SUPERFLUOUS QUALITY IN OTHERS
PAINTERS AND MUSICIANS HE COULD
TOLERATE AND EVEN ENCOURAGE BECAUSE HE COULD RELISH THE RESULTS OF
THEIR ART HE COULD SEE THE CHARM OF A FINE PICTURE AND FEEL THE
PLEASURE OF GOOD MUSIC BUT A QUIET POET WHATEVER FORCE STRUGGLED
WHATEVER FIRE GLOWED IN HIS BREAST IF HE COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED THE MAN
IN THE COUNTING HOUSE OF THE TRADESMAN IN THE PIECE HALL MIGHT HAVE
LIVED DESPISED AND DIED SCORNED UNDER THE EYES OF HIRAM YORKE
AND AS THERE ARE MANY HIRAM YORKES IN THE WORLD IT IS WELL THAT THE
TRUE POET QUIET EXTERNALLY THOUGH HE MAY BE HAS OFTEN A TRUCULENT
SPIRIT UNDER HIS PLACIDITY AND IS FULL OF SHREWDNESS IN HIS MEEKNESS
AND CAN MEASURE THE WHOLE STATURE OF THOSE WHO LOOK DOWN ON HIM AND
CORRECTLY ASCERTAIN THE WEIGHT AND VALUE OF THE PURSUITS THEY DISDAIN
HIM FOR NOT HAVING FOLLOWED
IT IS HAPPY THAT HE CAN HAVE HIS OWN BLISS
HIS OWN SOCIETY WITH HIS GREAT FRIEND AND GODDESS NATURE QUITE
INDEPENDENT OF THOSE WHO FIND LITTLE PLEASURE IN HIM AND IN WHOM HE
FINDS NO PLEASURE AT ALL
IT IS JUST THAT WHILE THE WORLD AND
CIRCUMSTANCES OFTEN TURN A DARK COLD SIDE TO HIM AND PROPERLY TOO
BECAUSE HE FIRST TURNS A DARK COLD CARELESS SIDE TO THEM HE SHOULD BE
ABLE TO MAINTAIN A FESTAL BRIGHTNESS AND CHERISHING GLOW IN HIS BOSOM
WHICH MAKES ALL BRIGHT AND GENIAL FOR HIM WHILE STRANGERS PERHAPS
DEEM HIS EXISTENCE A POLAR WINTER NEVER GLADDENED BY A SUN
THE TRUE
POET IS NOT ONE WHIT TO BE PITIED AND HE IS APT TO LAUGH IN HIS SLEEVE
WHEN ANY MISGUIDED SYMPATHIZER WHINES OVER HIS WRONGS
EVEN WHEN
UTILITARIANS SIT IN JUDGMENT ON HIM AND PRONOUNCE HIM AND HIS ART
USELESS HE HEARS THE SENTENCE WITH SUCH A HARD DERISION SUCH A BROAD
DEEP COMPREHENSIVE AND MERCILESS CONTEMPT OF THE UNHAPPY PHARISEES WHO
PRONOUNCE IT THAT HE IS RATHER TO BE CHIDDEN THAN CONDOLED WITH
THESE
HOWEVER ARE NOT MR
YORKE'S REFLECTIONS AND IT IS WITH MR
YORKE WE
HAVE AT PRESENT TO DO
I HAVE TOLD YOU SOME OF HIS FAULTS READER AS TO HIS GOOD POINTS HE
WAS ONE OF THE MOST HONOURABLE AND CAPABLE MEN IN YORKSHIRE EVEN THOSE
WHO DISLIKED HIM WERE FORCED TO RESPECT HIM
HE WAS MUCH BELOVED BY THE
POOR BECAUSE HE WAS THOROUGHLY KIND AND VERY FATHERLY TO THEM
TO HIS
WORKMEN HE WAS CONSIDERATE AND CORDIAL
WHEN HE DISMISSED THEM FROM AN
OCCUPATION HE WOULD TRY TO SET THEM ON TO SOMETHING ELSE OR IF THAT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE HELP THEM TO REMOVE WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO A DISTRICT
WHERE WORK MIGHT POSSIBLY BE HAD
IT MUST ALSO BE REMARKED THAT IF AS
SOMETIMES CHANCED ANY INDIVIDUAL AMONGST HIS HANDS SHOWED SIGNS OF
INSUBORDINATION YORKE WHO LIKE MANY WHO ABHOR BEING CONTROLLED KNEW
HOW TO CONTROL WITH VIGOUR HAD THE SECRET OF CRUSHING REBELLION IN THE
GERM OF ERADICATING IT LIKE A BAD WEED SO THAT IT NEVER SPREAD OR
DEVELOPED WITHIN THE SPHERE OF HIS AUTHORITY
SUCH BEING THE HAPPY STATE
OF HIS OWN AFFAIRS HE FELT HIMSELF AT LIBERTY TO SPEAK WITH THE UTMOST
SEVERITY OF THOSE WHO WERE DIFFERENTLY SITUATED TO ASCRIBE WHATEVER WAS
UNPLEASANT IN THEIR POSITION ENTIRELY TO THEIR OWN FAULT TO SEVER
HIMSELF FROM THE MASTERS AND ADVOCATE FREELY THE CAUSE OF THE
OPERATIVES
MR
YORKE'S FAMILY WAS THE FIRST AND OLDEST IN THE DISTRICT AND HE
THOUGH NOT THE WEALTHIEST WAS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MEN
HIS
EDUCATION HAD BEEN GOOD
IN HIS YOUTH BEFORE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HE
HAD TRAVELLED ON THE CONTINENT
HE WAS AN ADEPT IN THE FRENCH AND
ITALIAN LANGUAGES
DURING A TWO YEARS' SOJOURN IN ITALY HE HAD COLLECTED
MANY GOOD PAINTINGS AND TASTEFUL RARITIES WITH WHICH HIS RESIDENCE WAS
NOW ADORNED
HIS MANNERS WHEN HE LIKED WERE THOSE OF A FINISHED
GENTLEMAN OF THE OLD SCHOOL HIS CONVERSATION WHEN HE WAS DISPOSED TO
PLEASE WAS SINGULARLY INTERESTING AND ORIGINAL AND IF HE USUALLY
EXPRESSED HIMSELF IN THE YORKSHIRE DIALECT IT WAS BECAUSE HE CHOSE TO
DO SO PREFERRING HIS NATIVE DORIC TO A MORE REFINED VOCABULARY A
YORKSHIRE BURR HE AFFIRMED WAS AS MUCH BETTER THAN A COCKNEY'S LISP
AS A BULL'S BELLOW THAN A RATON'S SQUEAK
MR
YORKE KNEW EVERY ONE AND WAS KNOWN BY EVERY ONE FOR MILES ROUND
YET HIS INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES WERE VERY FEW
HIMSELF THOROUGHLY
ORIGINAL HE HAD NO TASTE FOR WHAT WAS ORDINARY A RACY ROUGH
CHARACTER HIGH OR LOW EVER FOUND ACCEPTANCE WITH HIM A REFINED
INSIPID PERSONAGE HOWEVER EXALTED IN STATION WAS HIS AVERSION
HE
WOULD SPEND AN HOUR ANY TIME IN TALKING FREELY WITH A SHREWD WORKMAN OF
HIS OWN OR WITH SOME QUEER SAGACIOUS OLD WOMAN AMONGST HIS COTTAGERS
WHEN HE WOULD HAVE GRUDGED A MOMENT TO A COMMONPLACE FINE GENTLEMAN OR
TO THE MOST FASHIONABLE AND ELEGANT IF FRIVOLOUS LADY
HIS PREFERENCES
ON THESE POINTS HE CARRIED TO AN EXTREME FORGETTING THAT THERE MAY BE
AMIABLE AND EVEN ADMIRABLE CHARACTERS AMONGST THOSE WHO CANNOT BE
ORIGINAL
YET HE MADE EXCEPTIONS TO HIS OWN RULE
THERE WAS A CERTAIN
ORDER OF MIND PLAIN INGENUOUS NEGLECTING REFINEMENT ALMOST DEVOID OF
INTELLECTUALITY AND QUITE INCAPABLE OF APPRECIATING WHAT WAS
INTELLECTUAL IN HIM BUT WHICH AT THE SAME TIME NEVER FELT DISGUST AT
HIS RUDENESS WAS NOT EASILY WOUNDED BY HIS SARCASM DID NOT CLOSELY
ANALYZE HIS SAYINGS DOINGS OR OPINIONS WITH WHICH HE WAS PECULIARLY
AT EASE AND CONSEQUENTLY WHICH HE PECULIARLY PREFERRED
HE WAS LORD
AMONGST SUCH CHARACTERS
THEY WHILE SUBMITTING IMPLICITLY TO HIS
INFLUENCE NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED BECAUSE THEY NEVER REFLECTED ON HIS
SUPERIORITY THEY WERE QUITE TRACTABLE THEREFORE WITHOUT RUNNING THE
SMALLEST DANGER OF BEING SERVILE AND THEIR UNTHINKING EASY ARTLESS
INSENSIBILITY WAS AS ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE AS CONVENIENT TO MR
YORKE AS
THAT OF THE CHAIR HE SAT ON OR OF THE FLOOR HE TROD
IT WILL HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THAT HE WAS NOT QUITE UNCORDIAL WITH MR
MOORE
HE HAD TWO OR THREE REASONS FOR ENTERTAINING A FAINT PARTIALITY
TO THAT GENTLEMAN
IT MAY SOUND ODD BUT THE FIRST OF THESE WAS THAT
MOORE SPOKE ENGLISH WITH A FOREIGN AND FRENCH WITH A PERFECTLY PURE
ACCENT AND THAT HIS DARK THIN FACE WITH ITS FINE THOUGH RATHER WASTED
LINES HAD A MOST ANTI BRITISH AND ANTI YORKSHIRE LOOK
THESE POINTS
SEEM FRIVOLOUS UNLIKELY TO INFLUENCE A CHARACTER LIKE YORKE'S BUT THE
FACT IS THEY RECALLED OLD PERHAPS PLEASURABLE ASSOCIATIONS THEY
BROUGHT BACK HIS TRAVELLING HIS YOUTHFUL DAYS
HE HAD SEEN AMIDST
ITALIAN CITIES AND SCENES FACES LIKE MOORE'S HE HAD HEARD IN PARISIAN
CAFS AND THEATRES VOICES LIKE HIS
HE WAS YOUNG THEN AND WHEN HE
LOOKED AT AND LISTENED TO THE ALIEN HE SEEMED YOUNG AGAIN
SECONDLY HE HAD KNOWN MOORE'S FATHER AND HAD HAD DEALINGS WITH HIM
THAT WAS A MORE SUBSTANTIAL THOUGH BY NO MEANS A MORE AGREEABLE TIE
FOR AS HIS FIRM HAD BEEN CONNECTED WITH MOORE'S IN BUSINESS IT HAD
ALSO IN SOME MEASURE BEEN IMPLICATED IN ITS LOSSES
THIRDLY HE HAD FOUND ROBERT HIMSELF A SHARP MAN OF BUSINESS
HE SAW
REASON TO ANTICIPATE THAT HE WOULD IN THE END BY ONE MEANS OR ANOTHER
MAKE MONEY AND HE RESPECTED BOTH HIS RESOLUTION AND ACUTENESS PERHAPS
ALSO HIS HARDNESS
A FOURTH CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH DREW THEM TOGETHER WAS
THAT OF MR
YORKE BEING ONE OF THE GUARDIANS OF THE MINOR ON WHOSE
ESTATE HOLLOW'S MILL WAS SITUATED CONSEQUENTLY MOORE IN THE COURSE OF
HIS ALTERATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS HAD FREQUENT OCCASION TO CONSULT HIM
AS TO THE OTHER GUEST NOW PRESENT IN MR
YORKE'S PARLOUR MR
HELSTONE
BETWEEN HIM AND HIS HOST THERE EXISTED A DOUBLE ANTIPATHY THE ANTIPATHY
OF NATURE AND THAT OF CIRCUMSTANCES
THE FREE THINKER HATED THE
FORMALIST THE LOVER OF LIBERTY DETESTED THE DISCIPLINARIAN
BESIDES IT
WAS SAID THAT IN FORMER YEARS THEY HAD BEEN RIVAL SUITORS OF THE SAME
LADY
MR
YORKE AS A GENERAL RULE WAS WHEN YOUNG NOTED FOR HIS PREFERENCE
OF SPRIGHTLY AND DASHING WOMEN A SHOWY SHAPE AND AIR A LIVELY WIT A
READY TONGUE CHIEFLY SEEMED TO ATTRACT HIM
HE NEVER HOWEVER PROPOSED
TO ANY OF THESE BRILLIANT BELLES WHOSE SOCIETY HE SOUGHT AND ALL AT
ONCE HE SERIOUSLY FELL IN LOVE WITH AND EAGERLY WOOED A GIRL WHO
PRESENTED A COMPLETE CONTRAST TO THOSE HE HAD HITHERTO NOTICED A GIRL
WITH THE FACE OF A MADONNA A GIRL OF LIVING MARBLE STILLNESS
PERSONIFIED
NO MATTER THAT WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER SHE ONLY ANSWERED HIM
IN MONOSYLLABLES NO MATTER THAT HIS SIGHS SEEMED UNHEARD THAT HIS
GLANCES WERE UNRETURNED THAT SHE NEVER RESPONDED TO HIS OPINIONS
RARELY SMILED AT HIS JESTS PAID HIM NO RESPECT AND NO ATTENTION NO
MATTER THAT SHE SEEMED THE OPPOSITE OF EVERYTHING FEMININE HE HAD EVER
IN HIS WHOLE LIFE BEEN KNOWN TO ADMIRE
FOR HIM MARY CAVE WAS PERFECT
BECAUSE SOMEHOW FOR SOME REASON NO DOUBT HE HAD A REASON HE LOVED
HER
MR
HELSTONE AT THAT TIME CURATE OF BRIARFIELD LOVED MARY TOO OR AT
ANY RATE HE FANCIED HER
SEVERAL OTHERS ADMIRED HER FOR SHE WAS
BEAUTIFUL AS A MONUMENTAL ANGEL BUT THE CLERGYMAN WAS PREFERRED FOR HIS
OFFICE'S SAKE THAT OFFICE PROBABLY INVESTING HIM WITH SOME OF THE
ILLUSION NECESSARY TO ALLURE TO THE COMMISSION OF MATRIMONY AND WHICH
MISS CAVE DID NOT FIND IN ANY OF THE YOUNG WOOL STAPLERS HER OTHER
ADORERS
MR
HELSTONE NEITHER HAD NOR PROFESSED TO HAVE MR
YORKE'S
ABSORBING PASSION FOR HER
HE HAD NONE OF THE HUMBLE REVERENCE WHICH
SEEMED TO SUBDUE MOST OF HER SUITORS HE SAW HER MORE AS SHE REALLY WAS
THAN THE REST DID
HE WAS CONSEQUENTLY MORE MASTER OF HER AND HIMSELF
SHE ACCEPTED HIM AT THE FIRST OFFER AND THEY WERE MARRIED
NATURE NEVER INTENDED MR
HELSTONE TO MAKE A VERY GOOD HUSBAND
ESPECIALLY TO A QUIET WIFE
HE THOUGHT SO LONG AS A WOMAN WAS SILENT
NOTHING AILED HER AND SHE WANTED NOTHING
IF SHE DID NOT COMPLAIN OF
SOLITUDE SOLITUDE HOWEVER CONTINUED COULD NOT BE IRKSOME TO HER
IF
SHE DID NOT TALK AND PUT HERSELF FORWARD EXPRESS A PARTIALITY FOR THIS
AN AVERSION TO THAT SHE HAD NO PARTIALITIES OR AVERSIONS AND IT WAS
USELESS TO CONSULT HER TASTES
HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF COMPREHENDING
WOMEN OR COMPARING THEM WITH MEN
THEY WERE A DIFFERENT PROBABLY A
VERY INFERIOR ORDER OF EXISTENCE
A WIFE COULD NOT BE HER HUSBAND'S
COMPANION MUCH LESS HIS CONFIDANTE MUCH LESS HIS STAY
HIS WIFE
AFTER A YEAR OR TWO WAS OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HIM IN ANY SHAPE AND
WHEN SHE ONE DAY AS HE THOUGHT SUDDENLY FOR HE HAD SCARCELY NOTICED
HER DECLINE BUT AS OTHERS THOUGHT GRADUALLY TOOK HER LEAVE OF HIM
AND OF LIFE AND THERE WAS ONLY A STILL BEAUTIFUL FEATURED MOULD OF
CLAY LEFT COLD AND WHITE IN THE CONJUGAL COUCH HE FELT HIS
BEREAVEMENT WHO SHALL SAY HOW LITTLE YET PERHAPS MORE THAN HE SEEMED
TO FEEL IT FOR HE WAS NOT A MAN FROM WHOM GRIEF EASILY WRUNG TEARS
HIS DRY EYED AND SOBER MOURNING SCANDALIZED AN OLD HOUSEKEEPER AND
LIKEWISE A FEMALE ATTENDANT WHO HAD WAITED UPON MRS
HELSTONE IN HER
SICKNESS AND WHO PERHAPS HAD HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF LEARNING MORE OF
THE DECEASED LADY'S NATURE OF HER CAPACITY FOR FEELING AND LOVING THAN
HER HUSBAND KNEW
THEY GOSSIPED TOGETHER OVER THE CORPSE RELATED
ANECDOTES WITH EMBELLISHMENTS OF HER LINGERING DECLINE AND ITS REAL OR
SUPPOSED CAUSE
IN SHORT THEY WORKED EACH OTHER UP TO SOME INDIGNATION
AGAINST THE AUSTERE LITTLE MAN WHO SAT EXAMINING PAPERS IN AN ADJOINING
ROOM UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT OPPROBRIUM HE WAS THE OBJECT
MRS
HELSTONE WAS HARDLY UNDER THE SOD WHEN RUMOURS BEGAN TO BE RIFE IN
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT SHE HAD DIED OF A BROKEN HEART
THESE MAGNIFIED
QUICKLY INTO REPORTS OF HARD USAGE AND FINALLY DETAILS OF HARSH
TREATMENT ON THE PART OF HER HUSBAND REPORTS GROSSLY UNTRUE BUT NOT
THE LESS EAGERLY RECEIVED ON THAT ACCOUNT
MR
YORKE HEARD THEM PARTLY
BELIEVED THEM
ALREADY OF COURSE HE HAD NO FRIENDLY FEELING TO HIS
SUCCESSFUL RIVAL
THOUGH HIMSELF A MARRIED MAN NOW AND UNITED TO A
WOMAN WHO SEEMED A COMPLETE CONTRAST TO MARY CAVE IN ALL RESPECTS HE
COULD NOT FORGET THE GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT OF HIS LIFE AND WHEN HE HEARD
THAT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO PRECIOUS TO HIM HAD BEEN NEGLECTED PERHAPS
ABUSED BY ANOTHER HE CONCEIVED FOR THAT OTHER A ROOTED AND BITTER
ANIMOSITY
OF THE NATURE AND STRENGTH OF THIS ANIMOSITY MR
HELSTONE WAS BUT HALF
AWARE
HE NEITHER KNEW HOW MUCH YORKE HAD LOVED MARY CAVE WHAT HE HAD
FELT ON LOSING HER NOR WAS HE CONSCIOUS OF THE CALUMNIES CONCERNING HIS
TREATMENT OF HER FAMILIAR TO EVERY EAR IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BUT HIS
OWN
HE BELIEVED POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES ALONE SEPARATED HIM
AND MR
YORKE
HAD HE KNOWN HOW THE CASE REALLY STOOD HE WOULD HARDLY
HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY ANY PERSUASION TO CROSS HIS FORMER RIVAL'S
THRESHOLD
MR
YORKE DID NOT RESUME HIS LECTURE OF ROBERT MOORE
THE CONVERSATION
ERE LONG RECOMMENCED IN A MORE GENERAL FORM THOUGH STILL IN A SOMEWHAT
DISPUTATIVE TONE
THE UNQUIET STATE OF THE COUNTRY THE VARIOUS
DEPREDATIONS LATELY COMMITTED ON MILL PROPERTY IN THE DISTRICT SUPPLIED
ABUNDANT MATTER FOR DISAGREEMENT ESPECIALLY AS EACH OF THE THREE
GENTLEMEN PRESENT DIFFERED MORE OR LESS IN HIS VIEWS ON THESE SUBJECTS
MR
HELSTONE THOUGHT THE MASTERS AGGRIEVED THE WORKPEOPLE UNREASONABLE
HE CONDEMNED SWEEPINGLY THE WIDESPREAD SPIRIT OF DISAFFECTION AGAINST
CONSTITUTED AUTHORITIES THE GROWING INDISPOSITION TO BEAR WITH PATIENCE
EVILS HE REGARDED AS INEVITABLE
THE CURES HE PRESCRIBED WERE VIGOROUS
GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE STRICT MAGISTERIAL VIGILANCE WHEN NECESSARY
PROMPT MILITARY COERCION
MR
YORKE WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER THIS INTERFERENCE VIGILANCE AND
COERCION WOULD FEED THOSE WHO WERE HUNGRY GIVE WORK TO THOSE WHO WANTED
WORK AND WHOM NO MAN WOULD HIRE
HE SCOUTED THE IDEA OF INEVITABLE
EVILS
HE SAID PUBLIC PATIENCE WAS A CAMEL ON WHOSE BACK THE LAST ATOM
THAT COULD BE BORNE HAD ALREADY BEEN LAID AND THAT RESISTANCE WAS NOW A
DUTY THE WIDESPREAD SPIRIT OF DISAFFECTION AGAINST CONSTITUTED
AUTHORITIES HE REGARDED AS THE MOST PROMISING SIGN OF THE TIMES THE
MASTERS HE ALLOWED WERE TRULY AGGRIEVED BUT THEIR MAIN GRIEVANCES HAD
BEEN HEAPED ON THEM BY A CORRUPT BASE AND BLOODY GOVERNMENT THESE
WERE MR
YORKE'S EPITHETS
MADMEN LIKE PITT DEMONS LIKE CASTLEREAGH
MISCHIEVOUS IDIOTS LIKE PERCEVAL WERE THE TYRANTS THE CURSES OF THE
COUNTRY THE DESTROYERS OF HER TRADE
IT WAS THEIR INFATUATED
PERSEVERANCE IN AN UNJUSTIFIABLE A HOPELESS A RUINOUS WAR WHICH HAD
BROUGHT THE NATION TO ITS PRESENT PASS
IT WAS THEIR MONSTROUSLY
OPPRESSIVE TAXATION IT WAS THE INFAMOUS ORDERS IN COUNCIL THE
ORIGINATORS OF WHICH DESERVED IMPEACHMENT AND THE SCAFFOLD IF EVER
PUBLIC MEN DID THAT HUNG A MILLSTONE ABOUT ENGLAND'S NECK
BUT WHERE WAS THE USE OF TALKING HE DEMANDED
WHAT CHANCE WAS THERE
OF REASON BEING HEARD IN A LAND THAT WAS KING RIDDEN PRIEST RIDDEN
PEER RIDDEN WHERE A LUNATIC WAS THE NOMINAL MONARCH AN UNPRINCIPLED
DEBAUCHEE THE REAL RULER WHERE SUCH AN INSULT TO COMMON SENSE AS
HEREDITARY LEGISLATORS WAS TOLERATED WHERE SUCH A HUMBUG AS A BENCH OF
BISHOPS SUCH AN ARROGANT ABUSE AS A PAMPERED PERSECUTING ESTABLISHED
CHURCH WAS ENDURED AND VENERATED WHERE A STANDING ARMY WAS MAINTAINED
AND A HOST OF LAZY PARSONS AND THEIR PAUPER FAMILIES WERE KEPT ON THE
FAT OF THE LAND
MR
HELSTONE RISING UP AND PUTTING ON HIS SHOVEL HAT OBSERVED IN
REPLY THAT IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE HE HAD MET WITH TWO OR THREE
INSTANCES WHERE SENTIMENTS OF THIS SORT HAD BEEN VERY BRAVELY MAINTAINED
SO LONG AS HEALTH STRENGTH AND WORLDLY PROSPERITY HAD BEEN THE ALLIES
OF HIM WHO PROFESSED THEM BUT THERE CAME A TIME HE SAID TO ALL MEN
'WHEN THE KEEPERS OF THE HOUSE SHOULD TREMBLE WHEN THEY SHOULD BE
AFRAID OF THAT WHICH IS HIGH AND FEAR SHOULD BE IN THE WAY AND THAT
TIME WAS THE TEST OF THE ADVOCATE OF ANARCHY AND REBELLION THE ENEMY OF
RELIGION AND ORDER
ERE NOW HE AFFIRMED HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO
READ THOSE PRAYERS OUR CHURCH HAS PROVIDED FOR THE SICK BY THE MISERABLE
DYING BED OF ONE OF HER MOST RANCOROUS FOES HE HAD SEEN SUCH A ONE
STRICKEN WITH REMORSE SOLICITOUS TO DISCOVER A PLACE FOR REPENTANCE
AND UNABLE TO FIND ANY THOUGH HE SOUGHT IT CAREFULLY WITH TEARS
HE
MUST FOREWARN MR
YORKE THAT BLASPHEMY AGAINST GOD AND THE KING WAS A
DEADLY SIN AND THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS 'JUDGMENT TO COME
MR
YORKE BELIEVED FULLY THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS JUDGMENT TO
COME
IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HOW ALL THE
SCOUNDRELS WHO SEEMED TRIUMPHANT IN THIS WORLD WHO BROKE INNOCENT
HEARTS WITH IMPUNITY ABUSED UNMERITED PRIVILEGES WERE A SCANDAL TO
HONOURABLE CALLINGS TOOK THE BREAD OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF THE POOR
BROWBEAT THE HUMBLE AND TRUCKLED MEANLY TO THE RICH AND PROUD WERE TO
BE PROPERLY PAID OFF IN SUCH COIN AS THEY HAD EARNED
BUT HE ADDED
WHENEVER HE GOT LOW SPIRITED ABOUT SUCH LIKE GOINGS ON AND THEIR
SEEMING SUCCESS IN THIS MUCKY LUMP OF A PLANET HE JUST REACHED DOWN T'
OWD BOOK POINTING TO A GREAT BIBLE IN THE BOOKCASE OPENED IT LIKE
AT A CHANCE AND HE WAS SURE TO LIGHT OF A VERSE BLAZING WI' A BLUE
BRIMSTONE LOW THAT SET ALL STRAIGHT
HE KNEW HE SAID WHERE SOME FOLK
WAR BOUND FOR JUST AS WEEL AS IF AN ANGEL WI' GREAT WHITE WINGS HAD
COME IN OWER T' DOOR STONE AND TOLD HIM
SIR SAID MR
HELSTONE COLLECTING ALL HIS DIGNITY SIR THE GREAT
KNOWLEDGE OF MAN IS TO KNOW HIMSELF AND THE BOURNE WHITHER HIS OWN
STEPS TEND
AY AY
YOU'LL RECOLLECT MR
HELSTONE THAT IGNORANCE WAS CARRIED AWAY
FROM THE VERY GATES OF HEAVEN BORNE THROUGH THE AIR AND THRUST IN AT A
DOOR IN THE SIDE OF THE HILL WHICH LED DOWN TO HELL
NOR HAVE I FORGOTTEN MR
YORKE THAT VAIN CONFIDENCE NOT SEEING THE
WAY BEFORE HIM FELL INTO A DEEP PIT WHICH WAS ON PURPOSE THERE MADE BY
THE PRINCE OF THE GROUNDS TO CATCH VAINGLORIOUS FOOLS WITHAL AND WAS
DASHED TO PIECES WITH HIS FALL
NOW INTERPOSED MR
MOORE WHO HAD HITHERTO SAT A SILENT BUT AMUSED
SPECTATOR OF THIS WORLDLY COMBAT AND WHOSE INDIFFERENCE TO THE PARTY
POLITICS OF THE DAY AS WELL AS TO THE GOSSIP OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MADE
HIM AN IMPARTIAL IF APATHETIC JUDGE OF THE MERITS OF SUCH AN
ENCOUNTER YOU HAVE BOTH SUFFICIENTLY BLACKBALLED EACH OTHER AND
PROVED HOW CORDIALLY YOU DETEST EACH OTHER AND HOW WICKED YOU THINK
EACH OTHER
FOR MY PART MY HATE IS STILL RUNNING IN SUCH A STRONG
CURRENT AGAINST THE FELLOWS WHO HAVE BROKEN MY FRAMES THAT I HAVE NONE
TO SPARE FOR MY PRIVATE ACQUAINTANCE AND STILL LESS FOR SUCH A VAGUE
THING AS A SECT OR A GOVERNMENT
BUT REALLY GENTLEMEN YOU BOTH SEEM
VERY BAD BY YOUR OWN SHOWING WORSE THAN EVER I SUSPECTED YOU TO BE I
DARE NOT STAY ALL NIGHT WITH A REBEL AND BLASPHEMER LIKE YOU YORKE AND
I HARDLY DARE RIDE HOME WITH A CRUEL AND TYRANNICAL ECCLESIASTIC LIKE
MR
HELSTONE
I AM GOING HOWEVER MR
MOORE SAID THE RECTOR STERNLY
COME WITH ME
OR NOT AS YOU PLEASE
NAY HE SHALL NOT HAVE THE CHOICE HE SHALL GO WITH YOU RESPONDED
YORKE
IT'S MIDNIGHT AND PAST AND I'LL HAVE NOB'DY STAYING UP I' MY
HOUSE ANY LONGER
YE MUN ALL GO
HE RANG THE BELL
DEB SAID HE TO THE SERVANT WHO ANSWERED IT CLEAR THEM FOLK OUT O'
T' KITCHEN AND LOCK T' DOORS AND BE OFF TO BED HERE IS YOUR WAY
GENTLEMEN HE CONTINUED TO HIS GUESTS AND LIGHTING THEM THROUGH THE
PASSAGE HE FAIRLY PUT THEM OUT AT HIS FRONT DOOR
THEY MET THEIR PARTY HURRYING OUT PELL MELL BY THE BACK WAY
THEIR
HORSES STOOD AT THE GATE THEY MOUNTED AND RODE OFF MOORE LAUGHING AT
THEIR ABRUPT DISMISSAL HELSTONE DEEPLY INDIGNANT THEREAT
CHAPTER V
HOLLOW'S COTTAGE
MOORE'S GOOD SPIRITS WERE STILL WITH HIM WHEN HE ROSE NEXT MORNING
HE
AND JOE SCOTT HAD BOTH SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE MILL AVAILING THEMSELVES
OF CERTAIN SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS PRODUCIBLE FROM RECESSES IN THE FRONT
AND BACK COUNTING HOUSES
THE MASTER ALWAYS AN EARLY RISER WAS UP
SOMEWHAT SOONER EVEN THAN USUAL
HE AWOKE HIS MAN BY SINGING A FRENCH
SONG AS HE MADE HIS TOILET
YE'RE NOT CUSTEN DAHN THEN MAISTER CRIED JOE

CLUMSY NOSE STANDING OUT THE MEAN FOREHEAD FALLING BACK THE PALE BLUE

JOE I'M AN
ANVERSOIS

LINEAGE WHICH IS THE REASON I SPEAK FRENCH
BUT YOUR FATHER WAR YORKSHIRE WHICH MAKS YE A BIT YORKSHIRE TOO AND
ONYBODY MAY SEE YE'RE AKIN TO US YE'RE SO KEEN O' MAKING BRASS AND
GETTING FORRARDS
JOE YOU'RE AN IMPUDENT DOG BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO A
BOORISH SORT OF INSOLENCE FROM MY YOUTH UP
THE 'CLASSE OUVRIRE' THAT
IS THE WORKING PEOPLE IN BELGIUM BEAR THEMSELVES BRUTALLY TOWARDS
THEIR EMPLOYERS AND BY BRUTALLY JOE I MEAN BRUTALEMENT WHICH
PERHAPS WHEN PROPERLY TRANSLATED SHOULD BE ROUGHLY
WE ALLUS SPEAK OUR MINDS I' THIS COUNTRY AND THEM YOUNG PARSONS AND
GRAND FOLK FRO' LONDON IS SHOCKED AT WER 'INCIVILITY AND WE LIKE WEEL
ENOUGH TO GI'E 'EM SUMMAT TO BE SHOCKED AT 'CAUSE IT'S SPORT TO US TO
WATCH 'EM TURN UP THE WHITES O' THEIR EEN AND SPREED OUT THEIR BITS O'
HANDS LIKE AS THEY'RE FLAYED WI' BOGARDS AND THEN TO HEAR 'EM SAY
NIPPING OFF THEIR WORDS SHORT LIKE 'DEAR DEAR WHET SEVEGES HOW VERY

YOU'RE A GREAT MAN YOU'RE A SUBLIME FELLOW BUT YOU'RE A PRIG A
CONCEITED NOODLE WITH IT ALL JOE YOU NEED NOT TO THINK THAT BECAUSE
YOU'VE PICKED UP A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF PRACTICAL MATHEMATICS AND
BECAUSE YOU HAVE FOUND SOME SCANTLING OF THE ELEMENTS OF CHEMISTRY AT
THE BOTTOM OF A DYEING VAT THAT THEREFORE YOU'RE A NEGLECTED MAN OF
SCIENCE AND YOU NEED NOT TO SUPPOSE THAT BECAUSE THE COURSE OF TRADE
DOES NOT ALWAYS RUN SMOOTH AND YOU AND SUCH AS YOU ARE SOMETIMES
SHORT OF WORK AND OF BREAD THAT THEREFORE YOUR CLASS ARE MARTYRS AND
THAT THE WHOLE FORM OF GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH YOU LIVE IS WRONG
AND
MOREOVER YOU NEED NOT FOR A MOMENT TO INSINUATE THAT THE VIRTUES HAVE
TAKEN REFUGE IN COTTAGES AND WHOLLY ABANDONED SLATED HOUSES
LET ME TELL
YOU I PARTICULARLY ABOMINATE THAT SORT OF TRASH BECAUSE I KNOW SO WELL
THAT HUMAN NATURE IS HUMAN NATURE EVERYWHERE WHETHER UNDER TILE OR
THATCH AND THAT IN EVERY SPECIMEN OF HUMAN NATURE THAT BREATHES VICE
AND VIRTUE ARE EVER FOUND BLENDED IN SMALLER OR GREATER PROPORTIONS
AND THAT THE PROPORTION IS NOT DETERMINED BY STATION
I HAVE SEEN
VILLAINS WHO WERE RICH AND I HAVE SEEN VILLAINS WHO WERE POOR AND I
HAVE SEEN VILLAINS WHO WERE NEITHER RICH NOR POOR BUT WHO HAD REALIZED
AGAR'S WISH AND LIVED IN FAIR AND MODEST COMPETENCY
THE CLOCK IS GOING
TO STRIKE SIX
AWAY WITH YOU JOE AND RING THE MILL BELL
IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY BY SIX O'CLOCK THEREFORE
DAWN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO STEAL ON NIGHT TO PENETRATE WITH A PALE RAY
ITS BROWN OBSCURITY AND GIVE A DEMI TRANSLUCENCE TO ITS OPAQUE SHADOWS
PALE ENOUGH THAT RAY WAS ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING NO COLOUR TINGED
THE EAST NO FLUSH WARMED IT
TO SEE WHAT A HEAVY LID DAY SLOWLY LIFTED
WHAT A WAN GLANCE SHE FLUNG ALONG THE HILLS YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE
SUN'S FIRE QUENCHED IN LAST NIGHT'S FLOODS
THE BREATH OF THIS MORNING
WAS CHILL AS ITS ASPECT A RAW WIND STIRRED THE MASS OF NIGHT CLOUD AND
SHOWED AS IT SLOWLY ROSE LEAVING A COLOURLESS SILVER GLEAMING RING
ALL ROUND THE HORIZON NOT BLUE SKY BUT A STRATUM OF PALER VAPOUR
BEYOND
IT HAD CEASED TO RAIN BUT THE EARTH WAS SODDEN AND THE POOLS
AND RIVULETS WERE FULL
THE MILL WINDOWS WERE ALIGHT THE BELL STILL RUNG LOUD AND NOW THE
LITTLE CHILDREN CAME RUNNING IN IN TOO GREAT A HURRY LET US HOPE TO
FEEL VERY MUCH NIPPED BY THE INCLEMENT AIR AND INDEED BY CONTRAST
PERHAPS THE MORNING APPEARED RATHER FAVOURABLE TO THEM THAN OTHERWISE
FOR THEY HAD OFTEN COME TO THEIR WORK THAT WINTER THROUGH SNOW STORMS
THROUGH HEAVY RAIN THROUGH HARD FROST
MR
MOORE STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE TO WATCH THEM PASS
HE COUNTED THEM AS
THEY WENT BY
TO THOSE WHO CAME RATHER LATE HE SAID A WORD OF REPRIMAND
WHICH WAS A LITTLE MORE SHARPLY REPEATED BY JOE SCOTT WHEN THE LINGERERS
REACHED THE WORK ROOMS
NEITHER MASTER NOR OVERLOOKER SPOKE SAVAGELY
THEY WERE NOT SAVAGE MEN EITHER OF THEM THOUGH IT APPEARED BOTH WERE
RIGID FOR THEY FINED A DELINQUENT WHO CAME CONSIDERABLY TOO LATE
MR
MOORE MADE HIM PAY HIS PENNY DOWN ERE HE ENTERED AND INFORMED HIM THAT
THE NEXT REPETITION OF THE FAULT WOULD COST HIM TWOPENCE
RULES NO DOUBT ARE NECESSARY IN SUCH CASES AND COARSE AND CRUEL
MASTERS WILL MAKE COARSE AND CRUEL RULES WHICH AT THE TIME WE TREAT OF
AT LEAST THEY USED SOMETIMES TO ENFORCE TYRANNICALLY BUT THOUGH I
DESCRIBE IMPERFECT CHARACTERS EVERY CHARACTER IN THIS BOOK WILL BE
FOUND TO BE MORE OR LESS IMPERFECT MY PEN REFUSING TO DRAW ANYTHING IN
THE MODEL LINE I HAVE NOT UNDERTAKEN TO HANDLE DEGRADED OR UTTERLY
INFAMOUS ONES
CHILD TORTURERS SLAVE MASTERS AND DRIVERS I CONSIGN TO
THE HANDS OF JAILERS
THE NOVELIST MAY BE EXCUSED FROM SULLYING HIS PAGE
WITH THE RECORD OF THEIR DEEDS
INSTEAD THEN OF HARROWING UP MY READER'S SOUL AND DELIGHTING HIS ORGAN
OF WONDER WITH EFFECTIVE DESCRIPTIONS OF STRIPES AND SCOURGINGS I AM
HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO INFORM HIM THAT NEITHER MR
MOORE NOR HIS OVERLOOKER
EVER STRUCK A CHILD IN THEIR MILL
JOE HAD INDEED ONCE VERY SEVERELY
FLOGGED A SON OF HIS OWN FOR TELLING A LIE AND PERSISTING IN IT BUT
LIKE HIS EMPLOYER HE WAS TOO PHLEGMATIC TOO CALM AS WELL AS TOO
REASONABLE A MAN TO MAKE CORPORAL CHASTISEMENT OTHER THAN THE EXCEPTION
TO HIS TREATMENT OF THE YOUNG
MR
MOORE HAUNTED HIS MILL HIS MILL YARD HIS DYE HOUSE AND HIS
WAREHOUSE TILL THE SICKLY DAWN STRENGTHENED INTO DAY
THE SUN EVEN
ROSE AT LEAST A WHITE DISC CLEAR TINTLESS AND ALMOST CHILL LOOKING
AS ICE PEEPED OVER THE DARK CREST OF A HILL CHANGED TO SILVER THE
LIVID EDGE OF THE CLOUD ABOVE IT AND LOOKED SOLEMNLY DOWN THE WHOLE
LENGTH OF THE DEN OR NARROW DALE TO WHOSE STRAIT BOUNDS WE ARE AT
PRESENT LIMITED
IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK THE MILL LIGHTS WERE ALL
EXTINGUISHED THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN FOR BREAKFAST THE CHILDREN RELEASED
FOR HALF AN HOUR FROM TOIL BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THE LITTLE TIN CANS
WHICH HELD THEIR COFFEE AND TO THE SMALL BASKETS WHICH CONTAINED THEIR
ALLOWANCE OF BREAD
LET US HOPE THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT IT WOULD BE A
PITY WERE IT OTHERWISE
AND NOW AT LAST MR
MOORE QUITTED THE MILL YARD AND BENT HIS STEPS TO
HIS DWELLING HOUSE
IT WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE FACTORY BUT
THE HEDGE AND HIGH BANK ON EACH SIDE OF THE LANE WHICH CONDUCTED TO IT
SEEMED TO GIVE IT SOMETHING OF THE APPEARANCE AND FEELING OF SECLUSION
IT WAS A SMALL WHITEWASHED PLACE WITH A GREEN PORCH OVER THE DOOR
SCANTY BROWN STALKS SHOWED IN THE GARDEN SOIL NEAR THIS PORCH AND
LIKEWISE BENEATH THE WINDOWS STALKS BUDLESS AND FLOWERLESS NOW BUT
GIVING DIM PREDICTION OF TRAINED AND BLOOMING CREEPERS FOR SUMMER DAYS
A GRASS PLAT AND BORDERS FRONTED THE COTTAGE
THE BORDERS PRESENTED ONLY
BLACK MOULD YET EXCEPT WHERE IN SHELTERED NOOKS THE FIRST SHOOTS OF
SNOWDROP OR CROCUS PEEPED GREEN AS EMERALD FROM THE EARTH
THE SPRING
WAS LATE IT HAD BEEN A SEVERE AND PROLONGED WINTER THE LAST DEEP SNOW
HAD BUT JUST DISAPPEARED BEFORE YESTERDAY'S RAINS ON THE HILLS INDEED
WHITE REMNANTS OF IT YET GLEAMED FLECKING THE HOLLOWS AND CROWNING THE
PEAKS THE LAWN WAS NOT VERDANT BUT BLEACHED AS WAS THE GRASS ON THE
BANK AND UNDER THE HEDGE IN THE LANE
THREE TREES GRACEFULLY GROUPED
ROSE BESIDE THE COTTAGE
THEY WERE NOT LOFTY BUT HAVING NO RIVALS NEAR
THEY LOOKED WELL AND IMPOSING WHERE THEY GREW
SUCH WAS MR
MOORE'S
HOME A SNUG NEST FOR CONTENT AND CONTEMPLATION BUT ONE WITHIN WHICH
THE WINGS OF ACTION AND AMBITION COULD NOT LONG LIE FOLDED
ITS AIR OF MODEST COMFORT SEEMED TO POSSESS NO PARTICULAR ATTRACTION FOR
ITS OWNER
INSTEAD OF ENTERING THE HOUSE AT ONCE HE FETCHED A SPADE FROM
A LITTLE SHED AND BEGAN TO WORK IN THE GARDEN
FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN
HOUR HE DUG ON UNINTERRUPTED
AT LENGTH HOWEVER A WINDOW OPENED AND A
FEMALE VOICE CALLED TO HIM
EH BIEN TU NE DJENES PAS CE MATIN
THE ANSWER AND THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION WAS IN FRENCH BUT AS THIS
IS AN ENGLISH BOOK I SHALL TRANSLATE IT INTO ENGLISH
IS BREAKFAST READY HORTENSE
CERTAINLY IT HAS BEEN READY HALF AN HOUR
THEN I AM READY TOO
I HAVE A CANINE HUNGER
HE THREW DOWN HIS SPADE AND ENTERED THE HOUSE
THE NARROW PASSAGE
CONDUCTED HIM TO A SMALL PARLOUR WHERE A BREAKFAST OF COFFEE AND BREAD
AND BUTTER WITH THE SOMEWHAT UN ENGLISH ACCOMPANIMENT OF STEWED PEARS
WAS SPREAD ON THE TABLE
OVER THESE VIANDS PRESIDED THE LADY WHO HAD
SPOKEN FROM THE WINDOW
I MUST DESCRIBE HER BEFORE I GO ANY FARTHER
SHE SEEMED A LITTLE OLDER THAN MR
MOORE PERHAPS SHE WAS THIRTY FIVE
TALL AND PROPORTIONATELY STOUT SHE HAD VERY BLACK HAIR FOR THE
PRESENT TWISTED UP IN CURL PAPERS A HIGH COLOUR IN HER CHEEKS A SMALL
NOSE A PAIR OF LITTLE BLACK EYES
THE LOWER PART OF HER FACE WAS LARGE
IN PROPORTION TO THE UPPER HER FOREHEAD WAS SMALL AND RATHER
CORRUGATED SHE HAD A FRETFUL THOUGH NOT AN ILL NATURED EXPRESSION OF
COUNTENANCE THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER WHOLE APPEARANCE ONE FELT
INCLINED TO BE HALF PROVOKED WITH AND HALF AMUSED AT
THE STRANGEST
POINT WAS HER DRESS A STUFF PETTICOAT AND A STRIPED COTTON CAMISOLE
THE PETTICOAT WAS SHORT DISPLAYING WELL A PAIR OF FEET AND ANKLES WHICH
LEFT MUCH TO BE DESIRED IN THE ARTICLE OF SYMMETRY
YOU WILL THINK I HAVE DEPICTED A REMARKABLE SLATTERN READER
NOT AT
ALL
HORTENSE MOORE SHE WAS MR
MOORE'S SISTER WAS A VERY ORDERLY
ECONOMICAL PERSON
THE PETTICOAT CAMISOLE AND CURL PAPERS WERE HER
MORNING COSTUME IN WHICH OF FORENOONS SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSTOMED
TO GO HER HOUSEHOLD WAYS IN HER OWN COUNTRY
SHE DID NOT CHOOSE TO
ADOPT ENGLISH FASHIONS BECAUSE SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LIVE IN ENGLAND SHE
ADHERED TO HER OLD BELGIAN MODES QUITE SATISFIED THAT THERE WAS A MERIT
IN SO DOING
MADEMOISELLE HAD AN EXCELLENT OPINION OF HERSELF AN OPINION NOT WHOLLY
UNDESERVED FOR SHE POSSESSED SOME GOOD AND STERLING QUALITIES BUT SHE
RATHER OVER ESTIMATED THE KIND AND DEGREE OF THESE QUALITIES AND QUITE
LEFT OUT OF THE ACCOUNT SUNDRY LITTLE DEFECTS WHICH ACCOMPANIED THEM
YOU COULD NEVER HAVE PERSUADED HER THAT SHE WAS A PREJUDICED AND
NARROW MINDED PERSON THAT SHE WAS TOO SUSCEPTIBLE ON THE SUBJECT OF HER
OWN DIGNITY AND IMPORTANCE AND TOO APT TO TAKE OFFENCE ABOUT TRIFLES
YET ALL THIS WAS TRUE
HOWEVER WHERE HER CLAIMS TO DISTINCTION WERE NOT
OPPOSED AND WHERE HER PREJUDICES WERE NOT OFFENDED SHE COULD BE KIND
AND FRIENDLY ENOUGH
TO HER TWO BROTHERS FOR THERE WAS ANOTHER GRARD
MOORE BESIDES ROBERT SHE WAS VERY MUCH ATTACHED
AS THE SOLE REMAINING
REPRESENTATIVES OF THEIR DECAYED FAMILY THE PERSONS OF BOTH WERE ALMOST
SACRED IN HER EYES
OF LOUIS HOWEVER SHE KNEW LESS THAN OF ROBERT
HE
HAD BEEN SENT TO ENGLAND WHEN A MERE BOY AND HAD RECEIVED HIS EDUCATION
AT AN ENGLISH SCHOOL
HIS EDUCATION NOT BEING SUCH AS TO ADAPT HIM FOR
TRADE PERHAPS TOO HIS NATURAL BENT NOT INCLINING HIM TO MERCANTILE
PURSUITS HE HAD WHEN THE BLIGHT OF HEREDITARY PROSPECTS RENDERED IT
NECESSARY FOR HIM TO PUSH HIS OWN FORTUNE ADOPTED THE VERY ARDUOUS AND
VERY MODEST CAREER OF A TEACHER
HE HAD BEEN USHER IN A SCHOOL AND WAS
SAID NOW TO BE TUTOR IN A PRIVATE FAMILY
HORTENSE WHEN SHE MENTIONED
LOUIS DESCRIBED HIM AS HAVING WHAT SHE CALLED DES MOYENS BUT AS
BEING TOO BACKWARD AND QUIET
HER PRAISE OF ROBERT WAS IN A DIFFERENT
STRAIN LESS QUALIFIED SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF HIM SHE REGARDED HIM AS
THE GREATEST MAN IN EUROPE ALL HE SAID AND DID WAS REMARKABLE IN HER
EYES AND SHE EXPECTED OTHERS TO BEHOLD HIM FROM THE SAME POINT OF VIEW
NOTHING COULD BE MORE IRRATIONAL MONSTROUS AND INFAMOUS THAN
OPPOSITION FROM ANY QUARTER TO ROBERT UNLESS IT WERE OPPOSITION TO
HERSELF
ACCORDINGLY AS SOON AS THE SAID ROBERT WAS SEATED AT THE
BREAKFAST TABLE AND SHE HAD HELPED HIM TO A PORTION OF STEWED PEARS
AND CUT HIM A GOOD SIZED BELGIAN TARTINE SHE BEGAN TO POUR OUT A FLOOD
OF AMAZEMENT AND HORROR AT THE TRANSACTION OF LAST NIGHT THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE FRAMES
QUELLE IDE TO DESTROY THEM
QUELLE ACTION HONTEUSE ON VOYAIT BIEN
QUE LES OUVRIERS DE CE PAYS TAIENT LA FOIS BETES ET MCHANTS
C'TAIT
ABSOLUMENT COMME LES DOMESTIQUES ANGLAIS LES SERVANTES SURTOUT RIEN
D'INSUPPORTABLE COMME CETTE SARA PAR EXEMPLE
SHE LOOKS CLEAN AND INDUSTRIOUS MR
MOORE REMARKED
LOOKS I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE LOOKS AND I DO NOT SAY THAT SHE IS
ALTOGETHER DIRTY OR IDLE MAIS ELLE EST D'UNE INSOLENCE SHE DISPUTED
WITH ME A QUARTER OF AN HOUR YESTERDAY ABOUT THE COOKING OF THE BEEF
SHE SAID I BOILED IT TO RAGS THAT ENGLISH PEOPLE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO
EAT SUCH A DISH AS OUR BOUILLI THAT THE BOUILLON WAS NO BETTER THAN
GREASY WARM WATER AND AS TO THE CHOUCROUTE SHE AFFIRMS SHE CANNOT
TOUCH IT THAT BARREL WE HAVE IN THE CELLAR DELIGHTFULLY PREPARED BY MY
OWN HANDS SHE TERMED A TUB OF HOG WASH WHICH MEANS FOOD FOR PIGS
I AM
HARASSED WITH THE GIRL AND YET I CANNOT PART WITH HER LEST I SHOULD GET
A WORSE
YOU ARE IN THE SAME POSITION WITH YOUR WORKMEN PAUVRE CHER
FRRE
I AM AFRAID YOU ARE NOT VERY HAPPY IN ENGLAND HORTENSE
IT IS MY DUTY TO BE HAPPY WHERE YOU ARE BROTHER BUT OTHERWISE THERE
ARE CERTAINLY A THOUSAND THINGS WHICH MAKE ME REGRET OUR NATIVE TOWN
ALL THE WORLD HERE APPEARS TO ME ILL BRED MAL LEV
I FIND MY HABITS
CONSIDERED RIDICULOUS
IF A GIRL OUT OF YOUR MILL CHANCES TO COME INTO
THE KITCHEN AND FIND ME IN MY JUPON AND CAMISOLE PREPARING DINNER FOR
YOU KNOW I CANNOT TRUST SARAH TO COOK A SINGLE DISH SHE SNEERS
IF I
ACCEPT AN INVITATION OUT TO TEA WHICH I HAVE DONE ONCE OR TWICE I
PERCEIVE I AM PUT QUITE INTO THE BACKGROUND I HAVE NOT THAT ATTENTION
PAID ME WHICH DECIDEDLY IS MY DUE
OF WHAT AN EXCELLENT FAMILY ARE THE
GRARDS AS WE KNOW AND THE MOORES ALSO THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO CLAIM A
CERTAIN RESPECT AND TO FEEL WOUNDED WHEN IT IS WITHHELD FROM THEM
IN
ANTWERP I WAS ALWAYS TREATED WITH DISTINCTION HERE ONE WOULD THINK
THAT WHEN I OPEN MY LIPS IN COMPANY I SPEAK ENGLISH WITH A RIDICULOUS
ACCENT WHEREAS I AM QUITE ASSURED THAT I PRONOUNCE IT PERFECTLY
HORTENSE IN ANTWERP WE WERE KNOWN RICH IN ENGLAND WE WERE NEVER KNOWN
BUT POOR
PRECISELY AND THUS MERCENARY ARE MANKIND
AGAIN DEAR BROTHER LAST
SUNDAY IF YOU RECOLLECT WAS VERY WET ACCORDINGLY I WENT TO CHURCH IN
MY NEAT BLACK SABOTS OBJECTS ONE WOULD NOT INDEED WEAR IN A FASHIONABLE
CITY BUT WHICH IN THE COUNTRY I HAVE EVER BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO USE FOR
WALKING IN DIRTY ROADS
BELIEVE ME AS I PACED UP THE AISLE COMPOSED
AND TRANQUIL AS I AM ALWAYS FOUR LADIES AND AS MANY GENTLEMEN
LAUGHED AND HID THEIR FACES BEHIND THEIR PRAYER BOOKS
WELL WELL DON'T PUT ON THE SABOTS AGAIN
I TOLD YOU BEFORE I THOUGHT
THEY WERE NOT QUITE THE THING FOR THIS COUNTRY
BUT BROTHER THEY ARE NOT COMMON SABOTS SUCH AS THE PEASANTRY WEAR
I
TELL YOU THEY ARE SABOTS NOIRS TRS PROPRES TRS CONVENABLES
AT MONS
AND LEUZE CITIES NOT VERY FAR REMOVED FROM THE ELEGANT CAPITAL OF
BRUSSELS IT IS VERY SELDOM THAT THE RESPECTABLE PEOPLE WEAR ANYTHING
ELSE FOR WALKING IN WINTER
LET ANY ONE TRY TO WADE THE MUD OF THE
FLEMISH CHAUSSES IN A PAIR OF PARIS BRODEQUINS ON M'EN DIRAIT DES
NOUVELLES
NEVER MIND MONS AND LEUZE AND THE FLEMISH CHAUSSES DO AT ROME AS THE
ROMANS DO
AND AS TO THE CAMISOLE AND JUPON I AM NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT
THEM EITHER
I NEVER SEE AN ENGLISH LADY DRESSED IN SUCH GARMENTS
ASK
CAROLINE HELSTONE
CAROLINE I ASK CAROLINE I CONSULT HER ABOUT MY DRESS IT IS SHE
WHO ON ALL POINTS SHOULD CONSULT ME
SHE IS A CHILD
SHE IS EIGHTEEN OR AT LEAST SEVENTEEN OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW ALL ABOUT
GOWNS PETTICOATS AND CHAUSSURES
DO NOT SPOIL CAROLINE I ENTREAT YOU BROTHER
DO NOT MAKE HER OF MORE
CONSEQUENCE THAN SHE OUGHT TO BE
AT PRESENT SHE IS MODEST AND
UNASSUMING LET US KEEP HER SO
WITH ALL MY HEART
IS SHE COMING THIS MORNING
SHE WILL COME AT TEN AS USUAL TO TAKE HER FRENCH LESSON
YOU DON'T FIND THAT SHE SNEERS AT YOU DO YOU
SHE DOES NOT
SHE APPRECIATES ME BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE HERE BUT
THEN SHE HAS MORE INTIMATE OPPORTUNITIES OF KNOWING ME
SHE SEES THAT I
HAVE EDUCATION INTELLIGENCE MANNER PRINCIPLES ALL IN SHORT WHICH
BELONGS TO A PERSON WELL BORN AND WELL BRED
ARE YOU AT ALL FOND OF HER
FOR FOND I CANNOT SAY
I AM NOT ONE WHO IS PRONE TO TAKE VIOLENT
FANCIES AND CONSEQUENTLY MY FRIENDSHIP IS THE MORE TO BE DEPENDED ON
I HAVE A REGARD FOR HER AS MY RELATIVE HER POSITION ALSO INSPIRES
INTEREST AND HER CONDUCT AS MY PUPIL HAS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH AS RATHER
TO ENHANCE THAN DIMINISH THE ATTACHMENT THAT SPRINGS FROM OTHER CAUSES
SHE BEHAVES PRETTY WELL AT LESSONS
TO ME SHE BEHAVES VERY WELL BUT YOU ARE CONSCIOUS BROTHER THAT I
HAVE A MANNER CALCULATED TO REPEL OVER FAMILIARITY TO WIN ESTEEM AND
TO COMMAND RESPECT
YET POSSESSED OF PENETRATION I PERCEIVE CLEARLY
THAT CAROLINE IS NOT PERFECT THAT THERE IS MUCH TO BE DESIRED IN HER
GIVE ME A LAST CUP OF COFFEE AND WHILE I AM DRINKING IT AMUSE ME WITH
AN ACCOUNT OF HER FAULTS
DEAR BROTHER I AM HAPPY TO SEE YOU EAT YOUR BREAKFAST WITH RELISH
AFTER THE FATIGUING NIGHT YOU HAVE PASSED
CAROLINE THEN IS DEFECTIVE
BUT WITH MY FORMING HAND AND ALMOST MOTHERLY CARE SHE MAY IMPROVE
THERE
IS ABOUT HER AN OCCASIONAL SOMETHING A RESERVE I THINK WHICH I DO NOT
QUITE LIKE BECAUSE IT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY GIRLISH AND SUBMISSIVE AND
THERE ARE GLIMPSES OF AN UNSETTLED HURRY IN HER NATURE WHICH PUT ME
OUT
YET SHE IS USUALLY MOST TRANQUIL TOO DEJECTED AND THOUGHTFUL
INDEED SOMETIMES
IN TIME I DOUBT NOT I SHALL MAKE HER UNIFORMLY
SEDATE AND DECOROUS WITHOUT BEING UNACCOUNTABLY PENSIVE
I EVER
DISAPPROVE WHAT IS NOT INTELLIGIBLE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR ACCOUNT IN THE LEAST
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY
'UNSETTLED HURRIES FOR INSTANCE
AN EXAMPLE WILL PERHAPS BE THE MOST SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION
I
SOMETIMES YOU ARE AWARE MAKE HER READ FRENCH POETRY BY WAY OF
PRACTICE IN PRONUNCIATION
SHE HAS IN THE COURSE OF HER LESSONS GONE
THROUGH MUCH OF CORNEILLE AND RACINE IN A VERY STEADY SOBER SPIRIT
SUCH AS I APPROVE
OCCASIONALLY SHE SHOWED INDEED A DEGREE OF LANGUOR
IN THE PERUSAL OF THOSE ESTEEMED AUTHORS PARTAKING RATHER OF APATHY
THAN SOBRIETY AND APATHY IS WHAT I CANNOT TOLERATE IN THOSE WHO HAVE
THE BENEFIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS BESIDES ONE SHOULD NOT BE APATHETIC IN
STUDYING STANDARD WORKS
THE OTHER DAY I PUT INTO HER HANDS A VOLUME OF
SHORT FUGITIVE PIECES
I SENT HER TO THE WINDOW TO LEARN ONE BY HEART
AND WHEN I LOOKED UP I SAW HER TURNING THE LEAVES OVER IMPATIENTLY AND
CURLING HER LIP ABSOLUTELY WITH SCORN AS SHE SURVEYED THE LITTLE POEMS
CURSORILY
I CHID HER
'MA COUSINE SAID SHE 'TOUT CELA M'ENNUIE LA
MORT I TOLD HER THIS WAS IMPROPER LANGUAGE
'DIEU SHE EXCLAIMED 'IL
N'Y A DONC PAS DEUX LIGNES DE POSIE DANS TOUTE LA LITTRATURE
FRANAISE I INQUIRED WHAT SHE MEANT
SHE BEGGED MY PARDON WITH PROPER
SUBMISSION
ERE LONG SHE WAS STILL
I SAW HER SMILING TO HERSELF OVER
THE BOOK
SHE BEGAN TO LEARN ASSIDUOUSLY
IN HALF AN HOUR SHE CAME AND
STOOD BEFORE ME PRESENTED THE VOLUME FOLDED HER HANDS AS I ALWAYS
REQUIRE HER TO DO AND COMMENCED THE REPETITION OF THAT SHORT THING BY
CHNIER 'LA JEUNE CAPTIVE IF YOU HAD HEARD THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE
WENT THROUGH THIS AND IN WHICH SHE UTTERED A FEW INCOHERENT COMMENTS
WHEN SHE HAD DONE YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT I MEANT BY THE PHRASE
'UNSETTLED HURRY ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT CHNIER WAS MORE MOVING THAN
ALL RACINE AND ALL CORNEILLE
YOU BROTHER WHO HAVE SO MUCH SAGACITY
WILL DISCERN THAT THIS DISPROPORTIONATE PREFERENCE ARGUES AN
ILL REGULATED MIND BUT SHE IS FORTUNATE IN HER PRECEPTRESS
I WILL GIVE
HER A SYSTEM A METHOD OF THOUGHT A SET OF OPINIONS I WILL GIVE HER
THE PERFECT CONTROL AND GUIDANCE OF HER FEELINGS
BE SURE YOU DO HORTENSE
HERE SHE COMES
THAT WAS HER SHADOW PASSED
THE WINDOW I BELIEVE
AH TRULY
SHE IS TOO EARLY HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HER TIME MY CHILD
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE BEFORE I HAVE BREAKFASTED
THIS QUESTION WAS ADDRESSED TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NOW ENTERED THE ROOM A
YOUNG GIRL WRAPPED IN A WINTER MANTLE THE FOLDS OF WHICH WERE GATHERED
WITH SOME GRACE ROUND AN APPARENTLY SLENDER FIGURE
I CAME IN HASTE TO SEE HOW YOU WERE HORTENSE AND HOW ROBERT WAS TOO
I WAS SURE YOU WOULD BE BOTH GRIEVED BY WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT
I DID
NOT HEAR TILL THIS MORNING
MY UNCLE TOLD ME AT BREAKFAST
AH IT IS UNSPEAKABLE
YOU SYMPATHIZE WITH US YOUR UNCLE SYMPATHIZES
WITH US
MY UNCLE IS VERY ANGRY BUT HE WAS WITH ROBERT I BELIEVE WAS HE
NOT DID HE NOT GO WITH YOU TO STILBRO' MOOR
YES WE SET OUT IN VERY MARTIAL STYLE CAROLINE BUT THE PRISONERS WE
WENT TO RESCUE MET US HALF WAY
OF COURSE NOBODY WAS HURT
WHY NO ONLY JOE SCOTT'S WRISTS WERE A LITTLE GALLED WITH BEING
PINIONED TOO TIGHTLY BEHIND HIS BACK
YOU WERE NOT THERE YOU WERE NOT WITH THE WAGONS WHEN THEY WERE
ATTACKED
NO
ONE SELDOM HAS THE FORTUNE TO BE PRESENT AT OCCURRENCES AT WHICH
ONE WOULD PARTICULARLY WISH TO ASSIST
WHERE ARE YOU GOING THIS MORNING I SAW MURGATROYD SADDLING YOUR HORSE
IN THE YARD
TO WHINBURY
IT IS MARKET DAY
MR
YORKE IS GOING TOO
I MET HIM IN HIS GIG
COME HOME WITH HIM
WHY
TWO ARE BETTER THAN ONE AND NOBODY DISLIKES MR
YORKE AT LEAST POOR
PEOPLE DO NOT DISLIKE HIM
THEREFORE HE WOULD BE A PROTECTION TO ME WHO AM HATED
WHO ARE MISUNDERSTOOD
THAT PROBABLY IS THE WORD
SHALL YOU BE
LATE WILL HE BE LATE COUSIN HORTENSE
IT IS TOO PROBABLE
HE HAS OFTEN MUCH BUSINESS TO TRANSACT AT WHINBURY
HAVE YOU BROUGHT YOUR EXERCISE BOOK CHILD
YES WHAT TIME WILL YOU RETURN ROBERT
I GENERALLY RETURN AT SEVEN
DO YOU WISH ME TO BE AT HOME EARLIER
TRY RATHER TO BE BACK BY SIX
IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY DARK AT SIX NOW BUT
BY SEVEN DAYLIGHT IS QUITE GONE
AND WHAT DANGER IS TO BE APPREHENDED CAROLINE WHEN DAYLIGHT IS
GONE WHAT PERIL DO YOU CONCEIVE COMES AS THE COMPANION OF DARKNESS FOR
ME
I AM NOT SURE THAT I CAN DEFINE MY FEARS BUT WE ALL HAVE A CERTAIN
ANXIETY AT PRESENT ABOUT OUR FRIENDS
MY UNCLE CALLS THESE TIMES
DANGEROUS
HE SAYS TOO THAT MILL OWNERS ARE UNPOPULAR
AND I AM ONE OF THE MOST UNPOPULAR IS NOT THAT THE FACT YOU ARE
RELUCTANT TO SPEAK OUT PLAINLY BUT AT HEART YOU THINK ME LIABLE TO
PEARSON'S FATE WHO WAS SHOT AT NOT INDEED FROM BEHIND A HEDGE BUT
IN HIS OWN HOUSE THROUGH HIS STAIRCASE WINDOW AS HE WAS GOING TO BED
ANNE PEARSON SHOWED ME THE BULLET IN THE CHAMBER DOOR REMARKED
CAROLINE GRAVELY AS SHE FOLDED HER MANTLE AND ARRANGED IT AND HER MUFF
ON A SIDE TABLE
YOU KNOW SHE CONTINUED THERE IS A HEDGE ALL THE
WAY ALONG THE ROAD FROM HERE TO WHINBURY AND THERE ARE THE FIELDHEAD
PLANTATIONS TO PASS BUT YOU WILL BE BACK BY SIX OR BEFORE
CERTAINLY HE WILL AFFIRMED HORTENSE
AND NOW MY CHILD PREPARE YOUR
LESSONS FOR REPETITION WHILE I PUT THE PEAS TO SOAK FOR THE PURE AT
DINNER
WITH THIS DIRECTION SHE LEFT THE ROOM
YOU SUSPECT I HAVE MANY ENEMIES THEN CAROLINE SAID MR
MOORE AND
DOUBTLESS YOU KNOW ME TO BE DESTITUTE OF FRIENDS
NOT DESTITUTE ROBERT
THERE IS YOUR SISTER YOUR BROTHER LOUIS WHOM I
HAVE NEVER SEEN THERE IS MR
YORKE AND THERE IS MY UNCLE BESIDES OF
COURSE MANY MORE
ROBERT SMILED
YOU WOULD BE PUZZLED TO NAME YOUR 'MANY MORE SAID HE
BUT SHOW ME YOUR EXERCISE BOOK
WHAT EXTREME PAINS YOU TAKE WITH THE
WRITING MY SISTER I SUPPOSE EXACTS THIS CARE
SHE WANTS TO FORM YOU
IN ALL THINGS AFTER THE MODEL OF A FLEMISH SCHOOL GIRL
WHAT LIFE ARE
YOU DESTINED FOR CAROLINE WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH YOUR FRENCH DRAWING
AND OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHEN THEY ARE ACQUIRED
YOU MAY WELL SAY WHEN THEY ARE ACQUIRED FOR AS YOU ARE AWARE TILL
HORTENSE BEGAN TO TEACH ME I KNEW PRECIOUS LITTLE
AS TO THE LIFE I AM
DESTINED FOR I CANNOT TELL
I SUPPOSE TO KEEP MY UNCLE'S HOUSE
TILL SHE HESITATED
TILL WHAT TILL HE DIES
NO
HOW HARSH TO SAY THAT I NEVER THINK OF HIS DYING
HE IS ONLY
FIFTY FIVE
BUT TILL IN SHORT TILL EVENTS OFFER OTHER OCCUPATIONS FOR
ME
A REMARKABLY VAGUE PROSPECT ARE YOU CONTENT WITH IT
I USED TO BE FORMERLY
CHILDREN YOU KNOW HAVE LITTLE REFLECTION OR
RATHER THEIR REFLECTIONS RUN ON IDEAL THEMES
THERE ARE MOMENTS NOW
WHEN I AM NOT QUITE SATISFIED
WHY
I AM MAKING NO MONEY EARNING NOTHING
YOU COME TO THE POINT LINA
YOU TOO THEN WISH TO MAKE MONEY
I DO
I SHOULD LIKE AN OCCUPATION AND IF I WERE A BOY IT WOULD NOT BE
SO DIFFICULT TO FIND ONE
I SEE SUCH AN EASY PLEASANT WAY OF LEARNING A
BUSINESS AND MAKING MY WAY IN LIFE
GO ON
LET US HEAR WHAT WAY
I COULD BE APPRENTICED TO YOUR TRADE THE CLOTH TRADE
I COULD LEARN IT
OF YOU AS WE ARE DISTANT RELATIONS
I WOULD DO THE COUNTING HOUSE WORK
KEEP THE BOOKS AND WRITE THE LETTERS WHILE YOU WENT TO MARKET
I KNOW
YOU GREATLY DESIRE TO BE RICH IN ORDER TO PAY YOUR FATHER'S DEBTS
PERHAPS I COULD HELP YOU TO GET RICH
HELP ME YOU SHOULD THINK OF YOURSELF
I DO THINK OF MYSELF BUT MUST ONE FOR EVER THINK ONLY OF ONESELF
OF WHOM ELSE DO I THINK OF WHOM ELSE DARE I THINK THE POOR OUGHT TO
HAVE NO LARGE SYMPATHIES IT IS THEIR DUTY TO BE NARROW
NO ROBERT
YES CAROLINE
POVERTY IS NECESSARILY SELFISH CONTRACTED GROVELLING
ANXIOUS
NOW AND THEN A POOR MAN'S HEART WHEN CERTAIN BEAMS AND DEWS
VISIT IT MAY SMELL LIKE THE BUDDING VEGETATION IN YONDER GARDEN ON THIS
SPRING DAY MAY FEEL RIPE TO EVOLVE IN FOLIAGE PERHAPS BLOSSOM BUT HE
MUST NOT ENCOURAGE THE PLEASANT IMPULSE HE MUST INVOKE PRUDENCE TO
CHECK IT WITH THAT FROSTY BREATH OF HERS WHICH IS AS NIPPING AS ANY
NORTH WIND
NO COTTAGE WOULD BE HAPPY THEN
WHEN I SPEAK OF POVERTY I DO NOT SO MUCH MEAN THE NATURAL HABITUAL
POVERTY OF THE WORKING MAN AS THE EMBARRASSED PENURY OF THE MAN IN
DEBT
MY GRUB WORM IS ALWAYS A STRAITENED STRUGGLING CARE WORN
TRADESMAN
CHERISH HOPE NOT ANXIETY
CERTAIN IDEAS HAVE BECOME TOO FIXED IN YOUR
MIND
IT MAY BE PRESUMPTUOUS TO SAY IT BUT I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG IN YOUR NOTIONS OF THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING
HAPPINESS AS THERE IS IN SECOND HESITATION
I AM ALL EAR CAROLINE
IN COURAGE LET ME SPEAK THE TRUTH IN YOUR MANNER MIND I SAY ONLY
MANNER TO THESE YORKSHIRE WORKPEOPLE
YOU HAVE OFTEN WANTED TO TELL ME THAT HAVE YOU NOT
YES OFTEN VERY OFTEN
THE FAULTS OF MY MANNER ARE I THINK ONLY NEGATIVE
I AM NOT PROUD
WHAT HAS A MAN IN MY POSITION TO BE PROUD OF I AM ONLY TACITURN
PHLEGMATIC AND JOYLESS
AS IF YOUR LIVING CLOTH DRESSERS WERE ALL MACHINES LIKE YOUR FRAMES AND
SHEARS
IN YOUR OWN HOUSE YOU SEEM DIFFERENT
TO THOSE OF MY OWN HOUSE I AM NO ALIEN WHICH I AM TO THESE ENGLISH
CLOWNS
I MIGHT ACT THE BENEVOLENT WITH THEM BUT ACTING IS NOT MY
FORTE
I FIND THEM IRRATIONAL PERVERSE THEY HINDER ME WHEN I LONG TO
HURRY FORWARD
IN TREATING THEM JUSTLY I FULFIL MY WHOLE DUTY TOWARDS
THEM
YOU DON'T EXPECT THEM TO LOVE YOU OF COURSE
NOR WISH IT
AH SAID THE MONITRESS SHAKING HER HEAD AND HEAVING A DEEP SIGH
WITH
THIS EJACULATION INDICATIVE THAT SHE PERCEIVED A SCREW TO BE LOOSE
SOMEWHERE BUT THAT IT WAS OUT OF HER REACH TO SET IT RIGHT SHE BENT
OVER HER GRAMMAR AND SOUGHT THE RULE AND EXERCISE FOR THE DAY
I SUPPOSE I AM NOT AN AFFECTIONATE MAN CAROLINE
THE ATTACHMENT OF A
VERY FEW SUFFICES ME
IF YOU PLEASE ROBERT WILL YOU MEND ME A PEN OR TWO BEFORE YOU GO
FIRST LET ME RULE YOUR BOOK FOR YOU ALWAYS CONTRIVE TO DRAW THE LINES
ASLANT
THERE NOW
AND NOW FOR THE PENS
YOU LIKE A FINE ONE I THINK
SUCH AS YOU GENERALLY MAKE FOR ME AND HORTENSE NOT YOUR OWN BROAD
POINTS
IF I WERE OF LOUIS'S CALLING I MIGHT STAY AT HOME AND DEDICATE THIS
MORNING TO YOU AND YOUR STUDIES WHEREAS I MUST SPEND IT IN SKYES'S
WOOL WAREHOUSE
YOU WILL BE MAKING MONEY
MORE LIKELY LOSING IT
AS HE FINISHED MENDING THE PENS A HORSE SADDLED AND BRIDLED WAS
BROUGHT UP TO THE GARDEN GATE
THERE FRED IS READY FOR ME I MUST GO
I'LL TAKE ONE LOOK TO SEE WHAT
THE SPRING HAS DONE IN THE SOUTH BORDER TOO FIRST
HE QUITTED THE ROOM AND WENT OUT INTO THE GARDEN GROUND BEHIND THE
MILL
A SWEET FRINGE OF YOUNG VERDURE AND OPENING FLOWERS SNOWDROP
CROCUS EVEN PRIMROSE BLOOMED IN THE SUNSHINE UNDER THE HOT WALL OF THE
FACTORY MOORE PLUCKED HERE AND THERE A BLOSSOM AND LEAF TILL HE HAD
COLLECTED A LITTLE BOUQUET
HE RETURNED TO THE PARLOUR PILFERED A
THREAD OF SILK FROM HIS SISTER'S WORK BASKET TIED THE FLOWERS AND LAID
THEM ON CAROLINE'S DESK
NOW GOOD MORNING
THANK YOU ROBERT
IT IS PRETTY IT LOOKS AS IT LIES THERE LIKE
SPARKLES OF SUNSHINE AND BLUE SKY
GOOD MORNING
HE WENT TO THE DOOR STOPPED OPENED HIS LIPS AS IF TO SPEAK SAID
NOTHING AND MOVED ON
HE PASSED THROUGH THE WICKET AND MOUNTED HIS
HORSE
IN A SECOND HE HAD FLUNG HIMSELF FROM HIS SADDLE AGAIN
TRANSFERRED THE REINS TO MURGATROYD AND RE ENTERED THE COTTAGE
I FORGOT MY GLOVES HE SAID APPEARING TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM THE
SIDE TABLE THEN AS AN IMPROMPTU THOUGHT HE REMARKED YOU HAVE NO
BINDING ENGAGEMENT AT HOME PERHAPS CAROLINE
I NEVER HAVE
SOME CHILDREN'S SOCKS WHICH MRS
RAMSDEN HAS ORDERED TO
KNIT FOR THE JEW'S BASKET BUT THEY WILL KEEP
JEW'S BASKET BE SOLD NEVER WAS UTENSIL BETTER NAMED
ANYTHING MORE
JEWISH THAN IT ITS CONTENTS AND THEIR PRICES CANNOT BE CONCEIVED
BUT
I SEE SOMETHING A VERY TINY CURL AT THE CORNERS OF YOUR LIP WHICH
TELLS ME THAT YOU KNOW ITS MERITS AS WELL AS I DO
FORGET THE JEW'S
BASKET THEN AND SPEND THE DAY HERE AS A CHANGE
YOUR UNCLE WON'T BREAK
HIS HEART AT YOUR ABSENCE
SHE SMILED
NO
THE OLD COSSACK I DARE SAY NOT MUTTERED MOORE
THEN STAY AND DINE WITH HORTENSE SHE WILL BE GLAD OF YOUR COMPANY
I
SHALL RETURN IN GOOD TIME
WE WILL HAVE A LITTLE READING IN THE EVENING
THE MOON RISES AT HALF PAST EIGHT AND I WILL WALK UP TO THE RECTORY
WITH YOU AT NINE
DO YOU AGREE
SHE NODDED HER HEAD AND HER EYES LIT UP
MOORE LINGERED YET TWO MINUTES
HE BENT OVER CAROLINE'S DESK AND GLANCED
AT HER GRAMMAR HE FINGERED HER PEN HE LIFTED HER BOUQUET AND PLAYED
WITH IT HIS HORSE STAMPED IMPATIENT FRED MURGATROYD HEMMED AND COUGHED
AT THE GATE AS IF HE WONDERED WHAT IN THE WORLD HIS MASTER WAS DOING
GOOD MORNING AGAIN SAID MOORE AND FINALLY VANISHED
HORTENSE COMING IN TEN MINUTES AFTER FOUND TO HER SURPRISE THAT
CAROLINE HAD NOT YET COMMENCED HER EXERCISE
CHAPTER VI
CORIOLANUS
MADEMOISELLE MOORE HAD THAT MORNING A SOMEWHAT ABSENT MINDED PUPIL
CAROLINE FORGOT AGAIN AND AGAIN THE EXPLANATIONS WHICH WERE GIVEN TO
HER
HOWEVER SHE STILL BORE WITH UNCLOUDED MOOD THE CHIDINGS HER
INATTENTION BROUGHT UPON HER
SITTING IN THE SUNSHINE NEAR THE WINDOW
SHE SEEMED TO RECEIVE WITH ITS WARMTH A KIND INFLUENCE WHICH MADE HER
BOTH HAPPY AND GOOD
THUS DISPOSED SHE LOOKED HER BEST AND HER BEST
WAS A PLEASING VISION
TO HER HAD NOT BEEN DENIED THE GIFT OF BEAUTY
IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY TO KNOW HER IN ORDER TO LIKE HER SHE WAS FAIR ENOUGH TO
PLEASE EVEN AT THE FIRST VIEW
HER SHAPE SUITED HER AGE IT WAS
GIRLISH LIGHT AND PLIANT EVERY CURVE WAS NEAT EVERY LIMB
PROPORTIONATE HER FACE WAS EXPRESSIVE AND GENTLE HER EYES WERE
HANDSOME AND GIFTED AT TIMES WITH A WINNING BEAM THAT STOLE INTO THE
HEART WITH A LANGUAGE THAT SPOKE SOFTLY TO THE AFFECTIONS
HER MOUTH
WAS VERY PRETTY SHE HAD A DELICATE SKIN AND A FINE FLOW OF BROWN HAIR
WHICH SHE KNEW HOW TO ARRANGE WITH TASTE CURLS BECAME HER AND SHE
POSSESSED THEM IN PICTURESQUE PROFUSION
HER STYLE OF DRESS ANNOUNCED
TASTE IN THE WEARER VERY UNOBTRUSIVE IN FASHION FAR FROM COSTLY IN
MATERIAL BUT SUITABLE IN COLOUR TO THE FAIR COMPLEXION WITH WHICH IT
CONTRASTED AND IN MAKE TO THE SLIGHT FORM WHICH IT DRAPED
HER PRESENT
WINTER GARB WAS OF MERINO THE SAME SOFT SHADE OF BROWN AS HER HAIR THE
LITTLE COLLAR ROUND HER NECK LAY OVER A PINK RIBBON AND WAS FASTENED
WITH A PINK KNOT
SHE WORE NO OTHER DECORATION
SO MUCH FOR CAROLINE HELSTONE'S APPEARANCE
AS TO HER CHARACTER OR
INTELLECT IF SHE HAD ANY THEY MUST SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES IN DUE TIME
HER CONNECTIONS ARE SOON EXPLAINED
SHE WAS THE CHILD OF PARENTS
SEPARATED SOON AFTER HER BIRTH IN CONSEQUENCE OF DISAGREEMENT OF
DISPOSITION
HER MOTHER WAS THE HALF SISTER OF MR
MOORE'S FATHER THUS
THOUGH THERE WAS NO MIXTURE OF BLOOD SHE WAS IN A DISTANT SENSE THE
COUSIN OF ROBERT LOUIS AND HORTENSE
HER FATHER WAS THE BROTHER OF MR
HELSTONE A MAN OF THE CHARACTER FRIENDS DESIRE NOT TO RECALL AFTER
DEATH HAS ONCE SETTLED ALL EARTHLY ACCOUNTS
HE HAD RENDERED HIS WIFE
UNHAPPY
THE REPORTS WHICH WERE KNOWN TO BE TRUE CONCERNING HIM HAD
GIVEN AN AIR OF PROBABILITY TO THOSE WHICH WERE FALSELY CIRCULATED
RESPECTING HIS BETTER PRINCIPLED BROTHER
CAROLINE HAD NEVER KNOWN HER
MOTHER AS SHE WAS TAKEN FROM HER IN INFANCY AND HAD NOT SINCE SEEN
HER HER FATHER DIED COMPARATIVELY YOUNG AND HER UNCLE THE RECTOR HAD
FOR SOME YEARS BEEN HER SOLE GUARDIAN
HE WAS NOT AS WE ARE AWARE MUCH
ADAPTED EITHER BY NATURE OR HABITS TO HAVE THE CHARGE OF A YOUNG GIRL
HE HAD TAKEN LITTLE TROUBLE ABOUT HER EDUCATION PROBABLY HE WOULD HAVE
TAKEN NONE IF SHE FINDING HERSELF NEGLECTED HAD NOT GROWN ANXIOUS ON
HER OWN ACCOUNT AND ASKED EVERY NOW AND THEN FOR A LITTLE ATTENTION
AND FOR THE MEANS OF ACQUIRING SUCH AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE AS COULD NOT BE
DISPENSED WITH
STILL SHE HAD A DEPRESSING FEELING THAT SHE WAS
INFERIOR THAT HER ATTAINMENTS WERE FEWER THAN WERE USUALLY POSSESSED BY
GIRLS OF HER AGE AND STATION AND VERY GLAD WAS SHE TO AVAIL HERSELF OF
THE KIND OFFER MADE BY HER COUSIN HORTENSE SOON AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF
THE LATTER AT HOLLOW'S MILL TO TEACH HER FRENCH AND FINE NEEDLE WORK
MDLLE
MOORE FOR HER PART DELIGHTED IN THE TASK BECAUSE IT GAVE HER
IMPORTANCE SHE LIKED TO LORD IT A LITTLE OVER A DOCILE YET QUICK PUPIL
SHE TOOK CAROLINE PRECISELY AT HER OWN ESTIMATE AS AN
IRREGULARLY TAUGHT EVEN IGNORANT GIRL AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT SHE MADE
RAPID AND EAGER PROGRESS IT WAS TO NO TALENT NO APPLICATION IN THE
SCHOLAR SHE ASCRIBED THE IMPROVEMENT BUT ENTIRELY TO HER OWN SUPERIOR
METHOD OF TEACHING
WHEN SHE FOUND THAT CAROLINE UNSKILLED IN ROUTINE
HAD A KNOWLEDGE OF HER OWN DESULTORY BUT VARIED THE DISCOVERY CAUSED
HER NO SURPRISE FOR SHE STILL IMAGINED THAT FROM HER CONVERSATION HAD
THE GIRL UNAWARES GLEANED THESE TREASURES
SHE THOUGHT IT EVEN WHEN
FORCED TO FEEL THAT HER PUPIL KNEW MUCH ON SUBJECTS WHEREOF SHE KNEW
LITTLE
THE IDEA WAS NOT LOGICAL BUT HORTENSE HAD PERFECT FAITH IN IT
MADEMOISELLE WHO PRIDED HERSELF ON POSSESSING UN ESPRIT POSITIF AND
ON ENTERTAINING A DECIDED PREFERENCE FOR DRY STUDIES KEPT HER YOUNG
COUSIN TO THE SAME AS CLOSELY AS SHE COULD
SHE WORKED HER UNRELENTINGLY
AT THE GRAMMAR OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE ASSIGNING HER AS THE MOST
IMPROVING EXERCISE SHE COULD DEVISE INTERMINABLE ANALYSES LOGIQUES
THESE ANALYSES WERE BY NO MEANS A SOURCE OF PARTICULAR PLEASURE TO
CAROLINE SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD HAVE LEARNED FRENCH JUST AS WELL WITHOUT
THEM AND GRUDGED EXCESSIVELY THE TIME SPENT IN PONDERING OVER
PROPOSITIONS PRINCIPALES ET INCIDENTS IN DECIDING THE INCIDENTE
DETERMINATIVE AND THE INCIDENTE APPLICATIVE IN EXAMINING WHETHER
THE PROPOSITION WAS PLEINE ELLIPTIQUE OR IMPLICITE SOMETIMES
SHE LOST HERSELF IN THE MAZE AND WHEN SO LOST SHE WOULD NOW AND THEN
WHILE HORTENSE WAS RUMMAGING HER DRAWERS UPSTAIRS AN UNACCOUNTABLE
OCCUPATION IN WHICH SHE SPENT A LARGE PORTION OF EACH DAY ARRANGING
DISARRANGING REARRANGING AND COUNTER ARRANGING CARRY HER BOOK TO
ROBERT IN THE COUNTING HOUSE AND GET THE ROUGH PLACE MADE SMOOTH BY HIS
AID
MR
MOORE POSSESSED A CLEAR TRANQUIL BRAIN OF HIS OWN
ALMOST AS
SOON AS HE LOOKED AT CAROLINE'S LITTLE DIFFICULTIES THEY SEEMED TO
DISSOLVE BENEATH HIS EYE
IN TWO MINUTES HE WOULD EXPLAIN ALL IN TWO
WORDS GIVE THE KEY TO THE PUZZLE
SHE THOUGHT IF HORTENSE COULD ONLY
TEACH LIKE HIM HOW MUCH FASTER SHE MIGHT LEARN REPAYING HIM BY AN
ADMIRING AND GRATEFUL SMILE RATHER SHED AT HIS FEET THAN LIFTED TO HIS
FACE SHE WOULD LEAVE THE MILL RELUCTANTLY TO GO BACK TO THE COTTAGE
AND THEN WHILE SHE COMPLETED THE EXERCISE OR WORKED OUT THE SUM FOR
MDLLE
MOORE TAUGHT HER ARITHMETIC TOO SHE WOULD WISH NATURE HAD MADE
HER A BOY INSTEAD OF A GIRL THAT SHE MIGHT ASK ROBERT TO LET HER BE HIS
CLERK AND SIT WITH HIM IN THE COUNTING HOUSE INSTEAD OF SITTING WITH
HORTENSE IN THE PARLOUR
OCCASIONALLY BUT THIS HAPPENED VERY RARELY SHE SPENT THE EVENING AT
HOLLOW'S COTTAGE
SOMETIMES DURING THESE VISITS MOORE WAS AWAY ATTENDING
A MARKET SOMETIMES HE WAS GONE TO MR
YORKE'S OFTEN HE WAS ENGAGED
WITH A MALE VISITOR IN ANOTHER ROOM BUT SOMETIMES TOO HE WAS AT HOME
DISENGAGED FREE TO TALK WITH CAROLINE
WHEN THIS WAS THE CASE THE
EVENING HOURS PASSED ON WINGS OF LIGHT THEY WERE GONE BEFORE THEY WERE
COUNTED
THERE WAS NO ROOM IN ENGLAND SO PLEASANT AS THAT SMALL PARLOUR
WHEN THE THREE COUSINS OCCUPIED IT
HORTENSE WHEN SHE WAS NOT TEACHING
OR SCOLDING OR COOKING WAS FAR FROM ILL HUMOURED IT WAS HER CUSTOM TO
RELAX TOWARDS EVENING AND TO BE KIND TO HER YOUNG ENGLISH KINSWOMAN
THERE WAS A MEANS TOO OF RENDERING HER DELIGHTFUL BY INDUCING HER TO
TAKE HER GUITAR AND SING AND PLAY
SHE THEN BECAME QUITE GOOD NATURED
AND AS SHE PLAYED WITH SKILL AND HAD A WELL TONED VOICE IT WAS NOT
DISAGREEABLE TO LISTEN TO HER
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY AGREEABLE
EXCEPT THAT HER FORMAL AND SELF IMPORTANT CHARACTER MODULATED HER
STRAINS AS IT IMPRESSED HER MANNERS AND MOULDED HER COUNTENANCE
MR
MOORE RELEASED FROM THE BUSINESS YOKE WAS IF NOT LIVELY HIMSELF
A WILLING SPECTATOR OF CAROLINE'S LIVELINESS A COMPLACENT LISTENER TO
HER TALK A READY RESPONDENT TO HER QUESTIONS
HE WAS SOMETHING
AGREEABLE TO SIT NEAR TO HOVER ROUND TO ADDRESS AND LOOK AT
SOMETIMES
HE WAS BETTER THAN THIS ALMOST ANIMATED QUITE GENTLE AND FRIENDLY
THE DRAWBACK WAS THAT BY THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS SURE TO BE FROZEN UP
AGAIN AND HOWEVER MUCH HE SEEMED IN HIS QUIET WAY TO ENJOY THESE
SOCIAL EVENINGS HE RARELY CONTRIVED THEIR RECURRENCE
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE
PUZZLED THE INEXPERIENCED HEAD OF HIS COUSIN
IF I HAD A MEANS OF
HAPPINESS AT MY COMMAND SHE THOUGHT I WOULD EMPLOY THAT MEANS OFTEN
I WOULD KEEP IT BRIGHT WITH USE AND NOT LET IT LIE FOR WEEKS ASIDE
TILL IT GETS RUSTY
YET SHE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO PUT IN PRACTICE HER OWN THEORY
MUCH AS SHE
LIKED AN EVENING VISIT TO THE COTTAGE SHE NEVER PAID ONE UNASKED
OFTEN INDEED WHEN PRESSED BY HORTENSE TO COME SHE WOULD REFUSE
BECAUSE ROBERT DID NOT SECOND OR BUT SLIGHTLY SECONDED THE REQUEST
THIS MORNING WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER OF HIS OWN UNPROMPTED WILL
GIVEN HER AN INVITATION AND THEN HE HAD SPOKEN SO KINDLY THAT IN
HEARING HIM SHE HAD RECEIVED A SENSE OF HAPPINESS SUFFICIENT TO KEEP HER
GLAD FOR THE WHOLE DAY
THE MORNING PASSED AS USUAL
MADEMOISELLE EVER BREATHLESSLY BUSY SPENT
IT IN BUSTLING FROM KITCHEN TO PARLOUR NOW SCOLDING SARAH NOW LOOKING
OVER CAROLINE'S EXERCISE OR HEARING HER REPETITION LESSON
HOWEVER
FAULTLESSLY THESE TASKS WERE ACHIEVED SHE NEVER COMMENDED IT WAS A
MAXIM WITH HER THAT PRAISE IS INCONSISTENT WITH A TEACHER'S DIGNITY AND
THAT BLAME IN MORE OR LESS UNQUALIFIED MEASURE IS INDISPENSABLE TO IT
SHE THOUGHT INCESSANT REPRIMAND SEVERE OR SLIGHT QUITE NECESSARY TO
THE MAINTENANCE OF HER AUTHORITY AND IF NO POSSIBLE ERROR WAS TO BE
FOUND IN THE LESSON IT WAS THE PUPIL'S CARRIAGE OR AIR OR DRESS OR
MIEN WHICH REQUIRED CORRECTION
THE USUAL AFFRAY TOOK PLACE ABOUT THE DINNER WHICH MEAL WHEN SARAH AT
LAST BROUGHT IT INTO THE ROOM SHE ALMOST FLUNG UPON THE TABLE WITH A
LOOK THAT EXPRESSED QUITE PLAINLY I NEVER DISHED SUCH STUFF I' MY LIFE
AFORE IT'S NOT FIT FOR DOGS NOTWITHSTANDING SARAH'S SCORN IT WAS A
SAVOURY REPAST ENOUGH
THE SOUP WAS A SORT OF PURE OF DRIED PEAS WHICH
MADEMOISELLE HAD PREPARED AMIDST BITTER LAMENTATIONS THAT IN THIS
DESOLATE COUNTRY OF ENGLAND NO HARICOT BEANS WERE TO BE HAD
THEN CAME A
DISH OF MEAT NATURE UNKNOWN BUT SUPPOSED TO BE
MISCELLANEOUS SINGULARLY CHOPPED UP WITH CRUMBS OF BREAD SEASONED
UNIQUELY THOUGH NOT UNPLEASANTLY AND BAKED IN A MOULD A QUEER BUT BY
NO MEANS UNPALATABLE DISH
GREENS ODDLY BRUISED FORMED THE
ACCOMPANYING VEGETABLE AND A PT OF FRUIT CONSERVED AFTER A RECIPE
DEVISED BY MADAME GRARD MOORE'S GRAND'MRE AND FROM THE TASTE OF
WHICH IT APPEARED PROBABLE THAT MLASSE HAD BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR
SUGAR COMPLETED THE DINNER
CAROLINE HAD NO OBJECTION TO THIS BELGIAN COOKERY INDEED SHE RATHER
LIKED IT FOR A CHANGE AND IT WAS WELL SHE DID SO FOR HAD SHE EVINCED
ANY DISRELISH THEREOF SUCH MANIFESTATION WOULD HAVE INJURED HER IN
MADEMOISELLE'S GOOD GRACES FOR EVER A POSITIVE CRIME MIGHT HAVE BEEN
MORE EASILY PARDONED THAN A SYMPTOM OF DISTASTE FOR THE FOREIGN
COMESTIBLES
SOON AFTER DINNER CAROLINE COAXED HER GOVERNESS COUSIN UPSTAIRS TO
DRESS
THIS MANUVRE REQUIRED MANAGEMENT
TO HAVE HINTED THAT THE
JUPON CAMISOLE AND CURL PAPERS WERE ODIOUS OBJECTS OR INDEED OTHER
THAN QUITE MERITORIOUS POINTS WOULD HAVE BEEN A FELONY
ANY PREMATURE
ATTEMPT TO URGE THEIR DISAPPEARANCE WAS THEREFORE UNWISE AND WOULD BE
LIKELY TO ISSUE IN THE PERSEVERING WEAR OF THEM DURING THE WHOLE DAY
CAREFULLY AVOIDING ROCKS AND QUICKSANDS HOWEVER THE PUPIL ON PRETENCE
OF REQUIRING A CHANGE OF SCENE CONTRIVED TO GET THE TEACHER ALOFT AND
ONCE IN THE BEDROOM SHE PERSUADED HER THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE
RETURNING THITHER AND THAT SHE MIGHT AS WELL MAKE HER TOILET NOW AND
WHILE MADEMOISELLE DELIVERED A SOLEMN HOMILY ON HER OWN SURPASSING MERIT
IN DISREGARDING ALL FRIVOLITIES OF FASHION CAROLINE DENUDED HER OF THE
CAMISOLE INVESTED HER WITH A DECENT GOWN ARRANGED HER COLLAR HAIR
ETC AND MADE HER QUITE PRESENTABLE
BUT HORTENSE WOULD PUT THE
FINISHING TOUCHES HERSELF AND THESE FINISHING TOUCHES CONSISTED IN A
THICK HANDKERCHIEF TIED ROUND THE THROAT AND A LARGE SERVANT LIKE
BLACK APRON WHICH SPOILED EVERYTHING
ON NO ACCOUNT WOULD MADEMOISELLE
HAVE APPEARED IN HER OWN HOUSE WITHOUT THE THICK HANDKERCHIEF AND THE
VOLUMINOUS APRON
THE FIRST WAS A POSITIVE MATTER OF MORALITY IT WAS
QUITE IMPROPER NOT TO WEAR A FICHU THE SECOND WAS THE ENSIGN OF A GOOD
HOUSEWIFE SHE APPEARED TO THINK THAT BY MEANS OF IT SHE SOMEHOW
EFFECTED A LARGE SAVING IN HER BROTHER'S INCOME
SHE HAD WITH HER OWN
HANDS MADE AND PRESENTED TO CAROLINE SIMILAR EQUIPMENTS AND THE ONLY
SERIOUS QUARREL THEY HAD EVER HAD AND WHICH STILL LEFT A SORENESS IN
THE ELDER COUSIN'S SOUL HAD ARISEN FROM THE REFUSAL OF THE YOUNGER ONE
TO ACCEPT OF AND PROFIT BY THESE ELEGANT PRESENTS
I WEAR A HIGH DRESS AND A COLLAR SAID CAROLINE AND I SHOULD FEEL
SUFFOCATED WITH A HANDKERCHIEF IN ADDITION AND MY SHORT APRONS DO QUITE
AS WELL AS THAT VERY LONG ONE
I WOULD RATHER MAKE NO CHANGE
YET HORTENSE BY DINT OF PERSEVERANCE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE COMPELLED HER
TO MAKE A CHANGE HAD NOT MR
MOORE CHANCED TO OVERHEAR A DISPUTE ON THE
SUBJECT AND DECIDED THAT CAROLINE'S LITTLE APRONS WOULD SUFFICE AND
THAT IN HIS OPINION AS SHE WAS STILL BUT A CHILD SHE MIGHT FOR THE
PRESENT DISPENSE WITH THE FICHU ESPECIALLY AS HER CURLS WERE LONG AND
ALMOST TOUCHED HER SHOULDERS
THERE WAS NO APPEAL AGAINST ROBERT'S OPINION THEREFORE HIS SISTER WAS
COMPELLED TO YIELD BUT SHE DISAPPROVED ENTIRELY OF THE PIQUANT NEATNESS
OF CAROLINE'S COSTUME AND THE LADYLIKE GRACE OF HER APPEARANCE
SOMETHING MORE SOLID AND HOMELY SHE WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED BEAUCOUP PLUS
CONVENABLE
THE AFTERNOON WAS DEVOTED TO SEWING
MADEMOISELLE LIKE MOST BELGIAN
LADIES WAS SPECIALLY SKILFUL WITH HER NEEDLE
SHE BY NO MEANS THOUGHT
IT WASTE OF TIME TO DEVOTE UNNUMBERED HOURS TO FINE EMBROIDERY
SIGHT DESTROYING LACE WORK MARVELLOUS NETTING AND KNITTING AND ABOVE
ALL TO MOST ELABORATE STOCKING MENDING
SHE WOULD GIVE A DAY TO THE
MENDING OF TWO HOLES IN A STOCKING ANY TIME AND THINK HER MISSION
NOBLY FULFILLED WHEN SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED IT
IT WAS ANOTHER OF
CAROLINE'S TROUBLES TO BE CONDEMNED TO LEARN THIS FOREIGN STYLE OF
DARNING WHICH WAS DONE STITCH BY STITCH SO AS EXACTLY TO IMITATE THE
FABRIC OF THE STOCKING ITSELF A WEARIFU' PROCESS BUT CONSIDERED BY
HORTENSE GRARD AND BY HER ANCESTRESSES BEFORE HER FOR LONG GENERATIONS
BACK AS ONE OF THE FIRST DUTIES OF A WOMAN SHE HERSELF HAD HAD A
NEEDLE COTTON AND A FEARFULLY TORN STOCKING PUT INTO HER HAND WHILE
SHE YET WORE A CHILD'S COIF ON HER LITTLE BLACK HEAD HER HAUTS FAITS
IN THE DARNING LINE HAD BEEN EXHIBITED TO COMPANY ERE SHE WAS SIX YEARS
OLD AND WHEN SHE FIRST DISCOVERED THAT CAROLINE WAS PROFOUNDLY IGNORANT
OF THIS MOST ESSENTIAL OF ATTAINMENTS SHE COULD HAVE WEPT WITH PITY
OVER HER MISERABLY NEGLECTED YOUTH
NO TIME DID SHE LOSE IN SEEKING UP A HOPELESS PAIR OF HOSE OF WHICH THE
HEELS WERE ENTIRELY GONE AND IN SETTING THE IGNORANT ENGLISH GIRL TO
REPAIR THE DEFICIENCY
THIS TASK HAD BEEN COMMENCED TWO YEARS AGO AND
CAROLINE HAD THE STOCKINGS IN HER WORK BAG YET
SHE DID A FEW ROWS EVERY
DAY BY WAY OF PENANCE FOR THE EXPIATION OF HER SINS
THEY WERE A
GRIEVOUS BURDEN TO HER SHE WOULD MUCH HAVE LIKED TO PUT THEM IN THE
FIRE AND ONCE MR
MOORE WHO HAD OBSERVED HER SITTING AND SIGHING OVER
THEM HAD PROPOSED A PRIVATE INCREMATION IN THE COUNTING HOUSE BUT TO
THIS PROPOSAL CAROLINE KNEW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOLITIC TO ACCEDE THE
RESULT COULD ONLY BE A FRESH PAIR OF HOSE PROBABLY IN WORSE CONDITION
SHE ADHERED THEREFORE TO THE ILLS SHE KNEW
ALL THE AFTERNOON THE TWO LADIES SAT AND SEWED TILL THE EYES AND
FINGERS AND EVEN THE SPIRITS OF ONE OF THEM WERE WEARY
THE SKY SINCE
DINNER HAD DARKENED IT HAD BEGUN TO RAIN AGAIN TO POUR FAST
SECRET
FEARS BEGAN TO STEAL ON CAROLINE THAT ROBERT WOULD BE PERSUADED BY MR
SYKES OR MR
YORKE TO REMAIN AT WHINBURY TILL IT CLEARED AND OF THAT
THERE APPEARED NO PRESENT CHANCE
FIVE O'CLOCK STRUCK AND TIME STOLE
ON STILL THE CLOUDS STREAMED
A SIGHING WIND WHISPERED IN THE
ROOF TREES OF THE COTTAGE DAY SEEMED ALREADY CLOSING THE PARLOUR FIRE
SHED ON THE CLEAR HEARTH A GLOW RUDDY AS AT TWILIGHT
IT WILL NOT BE FAIR TILL THE MOON RISES PRONOUNCED MADEMOISELLE
MOORE CONSEQUENTLY I FEEL ASSURED THAT MY BROTHER WILL NOT RETURN TILL
THEN
INDEED I SHOULD BE SORRY IF HE DID
WE WILL HAVE COFFEE
IT WOULD
BE VAIN TO WAIT FOR HIM
I AM TIRED
MAY I LEAVE MY WORK NOW COUSIN
YOU MAY SINCE IT GROWS TOO DARK TO SEE TO DO IT WELL
FOLD IT UP PUT
IT CAREFULLY IN YOUR BAG THEN STEP INTO THE KITCHEN AND DESIRE SARAH TO
BRING IN THE GOTER OR TEA AS YOU CALL IT
BUT IT HAS NOT YET STRUCK SIX
HE MAY STILL COME
HE WILL NOT I TELL YOU
I CAN CALCULATE HIS MOVEMENTS
I UNDERSTAND MY
BROTHER
SUSPENSE IS IRKSOME DISAPPOINTMENT BITTER
ALL THE WORLD HAS SOME
TIME OR OTHER FELT THAT
CAROLINE OBEDIENT TO ORDERS PASSED INTO THE
KITCHEN
SARAH WAS MAKING A DRESS FOR HERSELF AT THE TABLE
YOU ARE TO BRING IN COFFEE SAID THE YOUNG LADY IN A SPIRITLESS TONE
AND THEN SHE LEANED HER ARM AND HEAD AGAINST THE KITCHEN MANTELPIECE
AND HUNG LISTLESSLY OVER THE FIRE
HOW LOW YOU SEEM MISS BUT IT'S ALL BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN KEEPS YOU SO
CLOSE TO WORK
IT'S A SHAME
NOTHING OF THE KIND SARAH WAS THE BRIEF REPLY
OH BUT I KNOW IT IS
YOU'RE FIT TO CRY JUST THIS MINUTE FOR NOTHING
ELSE BUT BECAUSE YOU'VE SAT STILL THE WHOLE DAY
IT WOULD MAKE A KITTEN
DULL TO BE MEWED UP SO
SARAH DOES YOUR MASTER OFTEN COME HOME EARLY FROM MARKET WHEN IT IS
WET
NEVER HARDLY BUT JUST TO DAY FOR SOME REASON HE HAS MADE A
DIFFERENCE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE IS COME
I AM CERTAIN I SAW MURGATROYD LEAD HIS HORSE INTO THE YARD
BY THE BACK WAY WHEN I WENT TO GET SOME WATER AT THE PUMP FIVE MINUTES
SINCE
HE WAS IN THE COUNTING HOUSE WITH JOE SCOTT I BELIEVE
YOU ARE MISTAKEN
WHAT SHOULD I BE MISTAKEN FOR I KNOW HIS HORSE SURELY
BUT YOU DID NOT SEE HIMSELF
I HEARD HIM SPEAK THOUGH
HE WAS SAYING SOMETHING TO JOE SCOTT ABOUT
HAVING SETTLED ALL CONCERNING WAYS AND MEANS AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A
NEW SET OF FRAMES IN THE MILL BEFORE ANOTHER WEEK PASSED AND THAT THIS
TIME HE WOULD GET FOUR SOLDIERS FROM STILBRO' BARRACKS TO GUARD THE
WAGON
SARAH ARE YOU MAKING A GOWN
YES
IS IT A HANDSOME ONE
BEAUTIFUL GET THE COFFEE READY
I'LL FINISH CUTTING OUT THAT SLEEVE
FOR YOU AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME TRIMMING FOR IT
I HAVE SOME NARROW
SATIN RIBBON OF A COLOUR THAT WILL JUST MATCH IT
YOU'RE VERY KIND MISS
BE QUICK THERE'S A GOOD GIRL
BUT FIRST PUT YOUR MASTER'S SHOES ON THE
HEARTH HE WILL TAKE HIS BOOTS OFF WHEN HE COMES IN
I HEAR HIM HE IS
COMING
MISS YOU ARE CUTTING THE STUFF WRONG
SO I AM BUT IT IS ONLY A SNIP
THERE IS NO HARM DONE
THE KITCHEN DOOR OPENED MR
MOORE ENTERED VERY WET AND COLD
CAROLINE
HALF TURNED FROM HER DRESSMAKING OCCUPATION BUT RENEWED IT FOR A
MOMENT AS IF TO GAIN A MINUTE'S TIME FOR SOME PURPOSE
BENT OVER THE
DRESS HER FACE WAS HIDDEN THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO SETTLE HER FEATURES
AND VEIL THEIR EXPRESSION WHICH FAILED
WHEN SHE AT LAST MET MR
MOORE
HER COUNTENANCE BEAMED
WE HAD CEASED TO EXPECT YOU
THEY ASSERTED YOU WOULD NOT COME SHE
SAID
BUT I PROMISED TO RETURN SOON
YOU EXPECTED ME I SUPPOSE
NO ROBERT I DARED NOT WHEN IT RAINED SO FAST
AND YOU ARE WET AND
CHILLED
CHANGE EVERYTHING
IF YOU TOOK COLD I SHOULD WE SHOULD BLAME
OURSELVES IN SOME MEASURE
I AM NOT WET THROUGH MY RIDING COAT IS WATERPROOF
DRY SHOES ARE ALL I
REQUIRE
THERE THE FIRE IS PLEASANT AFTER FACING THE COLD WIND AND RAIN
FOR A FEW MILES
HE STOOD ON THE KITCHEN HEARTH CAROLINE STOOD BESIDE HIM
MR
MOORE
WHILE ENJOYING THE GENIAL GLOW KEPT HIS EYES DIRECTED TOWARDS THE
GLITTERING BRASSES ON THE SHELF ABOVE
CHANCING FOR AN INSTANT TO LOOK
DOWN HIS GLANCE RESTED ON AN UPLIFTED FACE FLUSHED SMILING HAPPY
SHADED WITH SILKY CURLS LIT WITH FINE EYES
SARAH WAS GONE INTO THE
PARLOUR WITH THE TRAY A LECTURE FROM HER MISTRESS DETAINED HER THERE
MOORE PLACED HIS HAND A MOMENT ON HIS YOUNG COUSIN'S SHOULDER STOOPED
AND LEFT A KISS ON HER FOREHEAD
OH SAID SHE AS IF THE ACTION HAD UNSEALED HER LIPS I WAS MISERABLE
WHEN I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT COME
I AM ALMOST TOO HAPPY NOW
ARE YOU
HAPPY ROBERT DO YOU LIKE TO COME HOME
I THINK I DO TO NIGHT AT LEAST
ARE YOU CERTAIN YOU ARE NOT FRETTING ABOUT YOUR FRAMES AND YOUR
BUSINESS AND THE WAR
NOT JUST NOW
ARE YOU POSITIVE YOU DON'T FEEL HOLLOW'S COTTAGE TOO SMALL FOR YOU AND
NARROW AND DISMAL
AT THIS MOMENT NO
CAN YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE NOT BITTER AT HEART BECAUSE RICH AND GREAT
PEOPLE FORGET YOU
NO MORE QUESTIONS
YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF YOU THINK I AM ANXIOUS TO CURRY
FAVOUR WITH RICH AND GREAT PEOPLE
I ONLY WANT MEANS A POSITION A
CAREER
WHICH YOUR OWN TALENT AND GOODNESS SHALL WIN YOU
YOU WERE MADE TO BE
GREAT YOU SHALL BE GREAT
I WONDER NOW IF YOU SPOKE HONESTLY OUT OF YOUR HEART WHAT RECIPE YOU
WOULD GIVE ME FOR ACQUIRING THIS SAME GREATNESS BUT I KNOW IT BETTER
THAN YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF
WOULD IT BE EFFICACIOUS WOULD IT WORK
YES POVERTY MISERY BANKRUPTCY
OH LIFE IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT
LINA
BUT YOU ARE WHAT I THINK YOU
I AM NOT
YOU ARE BETTER THEN
FAR WORSE
NO FAR BETTER
I KNOW YOU ARE GOOD
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT
YOU LOOK SO AND I FEEL YOU ARE SO
WHERE DO YOU FEEL IT
IN MY HEART
AH YOU JUDGE ME WITH YOUR HEART LINA YOU SHOULD JUDGE ME WITH YOUR
HEAD
I DO AND THEN I AM QUITE PROUD OF YOU
ROBERT YOU CANNOT TELL ALL MY
THOUGHTS ABOUT YOU
MR
MOORE'S DARK FACE MUSTERED COLOUR HIS LIPS SMILED AND YET WERE
COMPRESSED HIS EYES LAUGHED AND YET HE RESOLUTELY KNIT HIS BROW
THINK MEANLY OF ME LINA SAID HE
MEN IN GENERAL ARE A SORT OF
SCUM VERY DIFFERENT TO ANYTHING OF WHICH YOU HAVE AN IDEA
I MAKE NO
PRETENSION TO BE BETTER THAN MY FELLOWS
IF YOU DID I SHOULD NOT ESTEEM YOU SO MUCH
IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE
MODEST THAT I HAVE SUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOUR MERIT
ARE YOU FLATTERING ME HE DEMANDED TURNING SHARPLY UPON HER AND
SEARCHING HER FACE WITH AN EYE OF ACUTE PENETRATION
NO SHE SAID SOFTLY LAUGHING AT HIS SUDDEN QUICKNESS
SHE SEEMED TO
THINK IT UNNECESSARY TO PROFFER ANY EAGER DISAVOWAL OF THE CHARGE
YOU DON'T CARE WHETHER I THINK YOU FLATTER ME OR NOT
NO
YOU ARE SO SECURE OF YOUR OWN INTENTIONS
I SUPPOSE SO
WHAT ARE THEY CAROLINE
ONLY TO EASE MY MIND BY EXPRESSING FOR ONCE PART OF WHAT I THINK AND
THEN TO MAKE YOU BETTER SATISFIED WITH YOURSELF
BY ASSURING ME THAT MY KINSWOMAN IS MY SINCERE FRIEND
JUST SO
I AM YOUR SINCERE FRIEND ROBERT
AND I AM WHAT CHANCE AND CHANGE SHALL MAKE ME LINA
NOT MY ENEMY HOWEVER
THE ANSWER WAS CUT SHORT BY SARAH AND HER MISTRESS ENTERING THE KITCHEN
TOGETHER IN SOME COMMOTION
THEY HAD BEEN IMPROVING THE TIME WHICH MR
MOORE AND MISS HELSTONE HAD SPENT IN DIALOGUE BY A SHORT DISPUTE ON THE
SUBJECT OF CAF AU LAIT WHICH SARAH SAID WAS THE QUEEREST MESS SHE
EVER SAW AND A WASTE OF GOD'S GOOD GIFTS AS IT WAS THE NATURE OF
COFFEE TO BE BOILED IN WATER AND WHICH MADEMOISELLE AFFIRMED TO BE UN
BREUVAGE ROYAL A THOUSAND TIMES TOO GOOD FOR THE MEAN PERSON WHO
OBJECTED TO IT
THE FORMER OCCUPANTS OF THE KITCHEN NOW WITHDREW INTO THE PARLOUR
BEFORE HORTENSE FOLLOWED THEM THITHER CAROLINE HAD ONLY TIME AGAIN TO
QUESTION NOT MY ENEMY ROBERT AND MOORE QUAKER LIKE HAD REPLIED
WITH ANOTHER QUERY COULD I BE AND THEN SEATING HIMSELF AT THE
TABLE HAD SETTLED CAROLINE AT HIS SIDE
CAROLINE SCARCELY HEARD MADEMOISELLE'S EXPLOSION OF WRATH WHEN SHE
REJOINED THEM THE LONG DECLAMATION ABOUT THE CONDUITE INDIGNE DE CETTE
MCHANTE CRATURE SOUNDED IN HER EAR AS CONFUSEDLY AS THE AGITATED
RATTLING OF THE CHINA
ROBERT LAUGHED A LITTLE AT IT IN VERY SUBDUED
SORT AND THEN POLITELY AND CALMLY ENTREATING HIS SISTER TO BE
TRANQUIL ASSURED HER THAT IF IT WOULD YIELD HER ANY SATISFACTION SHE
SHOULD HAVE HER CHOICE OF AN ATTENDANT AMONGST ALL THE GIRLS IN HIS
MILL
ONLY HE FEARED THEY WOULD SCARCELY SUIT HER AS THEY WERE MOST OF
THEM HE WAS INFORMED COMPLETELY IGNORANT OF HOUSEHOLD WORK AND PERT
AND SELF WILLED AS SARAH WAS SHE WAS PERHAPS NO WORSE THAN THE
MAJORITY OF THE WOMEN OF HER CLASS
MADEMOISELLE ADMITTED THE TRUTH OF THIS CONJECTURE ACCORDING TO HER
CES PAYSANNES ANGLAISES TAIENT TOUT INSUPPORTABLES WHAT WOULD SHE
NOT GIVE FOR SOME BONNE CUISINIRE ANVERSOISE WITH THE HIGH CAP
SHORT PETTICOAT AND DECENT SABOTS PROPER TO HER CLASS SOMETHING
BETTER INDEED THAN AN INSOLENT COQUETTE IN A FLOUNCED GOWN AND
ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT CAP FOR SARAH IT APPEARS DID NOT PARTAKE THE
OPINION OF ST
PAUL THAT IT IS A SHAME FOR A WOMAN TO GO WITH HER HEAD
UNCOVERED BUT HOLDING RATHER A CONTRARY DOCTRINE RESOLUTELY REFUSED
TO IMPRISON IN LINEN OR MUSLIN THE PLENTIFUL TRESSES OF HER YELLOW HAIR
WHICH IT WAS HER WONT TO FASTEN UP SMARTLY WITH A COMB BEHIND AND ON
SUNDAYS TO WEAR CURLED IN FRONT
SHALL I TRY AND GET YOU AN ANTWERP GIRL ASKED MR
MOORE WHO STERN
IN PUBLIC WAS ON THE WHOLE VERY KIND IN PRIVATE
MERCI DU CADEAU WAS THE ANSWER
AN ANTWERP GIRL WOULD NOT STAY HERE
TEN DAYS SNEERED AT AS SHE WOULD BE BY ALL THE YOUNG COQUINES IN YOUR
FACTORY THEN SOFTENING YOU ARE VERY GOOD DEAR BROTHER EXCUSE MY
PETULANCE BUT TRULY MY DOMESTIC TRIALS ARE SEVERE YET THEY ARE
PROBABLY MY DESTINY FOR I RECOLLECT THAT OUR REVERED MOTHER EXPERIENCED
SIMILAR SUFFERINGS THOUGH SHE HAD THE CHOICE OF ALL THE BEST SERVANTS
IN ANTWERP
DOMESTICS ARE IN ALL COUNTRIES A SPOILED AND UNRULY SET
MR
MOORE HAD ALSO CERTAIN REMINISCENCES ABOUT THE TRIALS OF HIS REVERED
MOTHER
A GOOD MOTHER SHE HAD BEEN TO HIM AND HE HONOURED HER MEMORY
BUT HE RECOLLECTED THAT SHE KEPT A HOT KITCHEN OF IT IN ANTWERP JUST AS
HIS FAITHFUL SISTER DID HERE IN ENGLAND
THUS THEREFORE HE LET THE
SUBJECT DROP AND WHEN THE COFFEE SERVICE WAS REMOVED PROCEEDED TO
CONSOLE HORTENSE BY FETCHING HER MUSIC BOOK AND GUITAR AND HAVING
ARRANGED THE RIBBON OF THE INSTRUMENT ROUND HER NECK WITH A QUIET
FRATERNAL KINDNESS HE KNEW TO BE ALL POWERFUL IN SOOTHING HER MOST
RUFFLED MOODS HE ASKED HER TO GIVE HIM SOME OF THEIR MOTHER'S FAVOURITE
SONGS
NOTHING REFINES LIKE AFFECTION
FAMILY JARRING VULGARIZES FAMILY UNION
ELEVATES
HORTENSE PLEASED WITH HER BROTHER AND GRATEFUL TO HIM
LOOKED AS SHE TOUCHED HER GUITAR ALMOST GRACEFUL ALMOST HANDSOME HER
EVERYDAY FRETFUL LOOK WAS GONE FOR A MOMENT AND WAS REPLACED BY A
SOURIRE PLEIN DE BONT SHE SANG THE SONGS HE ASKED FOR WITH FEELING
THEY REMINDED HER OF A PARENT TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN TRULY ATTACHED THEY
REMINDED HER OF HER YOUNG DAYS
SHE OBSERVED TOO THAT CAROLINE
LISTENED WITH NAVE INTEREST THIS AUGMENTED HER GOOD HUMOUR AND THE
EXCLAMATION AT THE CLOSE OF THE SONG I WISH I COULD SING AND PLAY LIKE
HORTENSE ACHIEVED THE BUSINESS AND RENDERED HER CHARMING FOR THE
EVENING
IT IS TRUE A LITTLE LECTURE TO CAROLINE FOLLOWED ON THE VANITY OF
WISHING AND THE DUTY OF TRYING
AS ROME IT WAS SUGGESTED HAD
NOT BEEN BUILT IN A DAY SO NEITHER HAD MADEMOISELLE GRARD MOORE'S
EDUCATION BEEN COMPLETED IN A WEEK OR BY MERELY WISHING TO BE CLEVER
IT WAS EFFORT THAT HAD ACCOMPLISHED THAT GREAT WORK
SHE WAS EVER
REMARKABLE FOR HER PERSEVERANCE FOR HER INDUSTRY
HER MASTERS HAD
REMARKED THAT IT WAS AS DELIGHTFUL AS IT WAS UNCOMMON TO FIND SO MUCH
TALENT UNITED WITH SO MUCH SOLIDITY AND SO ON ONCE ON THE THEME OF
HER OWN MERITS MADEMOISELLE WAS FLUENT
CRADLED AT LAST IN BLISSFUL SELF COMPLACENCY SHE TOOK HER KNITTING AND
SAT DOWN TRANQUIL
DRAWN CURTAINS A CLEAR FIRE A SOFTLY SHINING LAMP
GAVE NOW TO THE LITTLE PARLOUR ITS BEST ITS EVENING CHARM
IT IS
PROBABLE THAT THE THREE THERE PRESENT FELT THIS CHARM
THEY ALL LOOKED
HAPPY
WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW CAROLINE ASKED MR
MOORE RETURNING TO HIS SEAT
BESIDE HIS COUSIN
WHAT SHALL WE DO ROBERT REPEATED SHE PLAYFULLY
YOU DECIDE
NOT PLAY AT CHESS
NO
NOR DRAUGHTS NOR BACKGAMMON
NO NO WE BOTH HATE SILENT GAMES THAT ONLY KEEP ONE'S HANDS EMPLOYED
DON'T WE
I BELIEVE WE DO
THEN SHALL WE TALK SCANDAL
ABOUT WHOM ARE WE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED IN ANYBODY TO TAKE A
PLEASURE IN PULLING THEIR CHARACTER TO PIECES
A QUESTION THAT COMES TO THE POINT
FOR MY PART UNAMIABLE AS IT
SOUNDS I MUST SAY NO
AND I TOO
BUT IT IS STRANGE THOUGH WE WANT NO THIRD FOURTH I MEAN
SHE HASTILY AND WITH CONTRITION GLANCED AT HORTENSE LIVING PERSON
AMONG US SO SELFISH WE ARE IN OUR HAPPINESS THOUGH WE DON'T WANT TO
THINK OF THE PRESENT EXISTING WORLD IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO GO BACK TO
THE PAST TO HEAR PEOPLE THAT HAVE SLEPT FOR GENERATIONS IN GRAVES THAT
ARE PERHAPS NO LONGER GRAVES NOW BUT GARDENS AND FIELDS SPEAK TO US
AND TELL US THEIR THOUGHTS AND IMPART THEIR IDEAS
WHO SHALL BE THE SPEAKER WHAT LANGUAGE SHALL HE UTTER FRENCH
YOUR FRENCH FOREFATHERS DON'T SPEAK SO SWEETLY NOR SO SOLEMNLY NOR SO
IMPRESSIVELY AS YOUR ENGLISH ANCESTORS ROBERT
TO NIGHT YOU SHALL BE
ENTIRELY ENGLISH
YOU SHALL READ AN ENGLISH BOOK
AN OLD ENGLISH BOOK
YES AN OLD ENGLISH BOOK ONE THAT YOU LIKE AND I WILL CHOOSE A PART
OF IT THAT IS TONED QUITE IN HARMONY WITH SOMETHING IN YOU
IT SHALL
WAKEN YOUR NATURE FILL YOUR MIND WITH MUSIC IT SHALL PASS LIKE A
SKILFUL HAND OVER YOUR HEART AND MAKE ITS STRINGS SOUND
YOUR HEART IS
A LYRE ROBERT BUT THE LOT OF YOUR LIFE HAS NOT BEEN A MINSTREL TO
SWEEP IT AND IT IS OFTEN SILENT
LET GLORIOUS WILLIAM COME NEAR AND
TOUCH IT
YOU WILL SEE HOW HE WILL DRAW THE ENGLISH POWER AND MELODY OUT
OF ITS CHORDS
I MUST READ SHAKESPEARE
YOU MUST HAVE HIS SPIRIT BEFORE YOU YOU MUST HEAR HIS VOICE WITH YOUR
MIND'S EAR YOU MUST TAKE SOME OF HIS SOUL INTO YOURS
WITH A VIEW TO MAKING ME BETTER IS IT TO OPERATE LIKE A SERMON
IT IS TO STIR YOU TO GIVE YOU NEW SENSATIONS
IT IS TO MAKE YOU FEEL
YOUR LIFE STRONGLY NOT ONLY YOUR VIRTUES BUT YOUR VICIOUS PERVERSE
POINTS
DIEU QUE DIT ELLE CRIED HORTENSE WHO HITHERTO HAD BEEN COUNTING
STITCHES IN HER KNITTING AND HAD NOT MUCH ATTENDED TO WHAT WAS SAID
BUT WHOSE EAR THESE TWO STRONG WORDS CAUGHT WITH A TWEAK
NEVER MIND HER SISTER LET HER TALK
NOW JUST LET HER SAY ANYTHING SHE
PLEASES TO NIGHT
SHE LIKES TO COME DOWN HARD UPON YOUR BROTHER
SOMETIMES
IT AMUSES ME SO LET HER ALONE
CAROLINE WHO MOUNTED ON A CHAIR HAD BEEN RUMMAGING THE BOOKCASE
RETURNED WITH A BOOK
HERE'S SHAKESPEARE SHE SAID AND THERE'S 'CORIOLANUS NOW READ
AND DISCOVER BY THE FEELINGS THE READING WILL GIVE YOU AT ONCE HOW LOW
AND HOW HIGH YOU ARE
COME THEN SIT NEAR ME AND CORRECT WHEN I MISPRONOUNCE
I AM TO BE THE TEACHER THEN AND YOU MY PUPIL
AINSI SOIT IL
AND SHAKESPEARE IS OUR SCIENCE SINCE WE ARE GOING TO STUDY
IT APPEARS SO
AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE FRENCH AND SCEPTICAL AND SNEERING YOU
ARE NOT GOING TO THINK IT A SIGN OF WISDOM TO REFUSE TO ADMIRE
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU DO ROBERT I'LL TAKE SHAKESPEARE AWAY AND I'LL SHRIVEL UP
WITHIN MYSELF AND PUT ON MY BONNET AND GO HOME
SIT DOWN
HERE I BEGIN
ONE MINUTE IF YOU PLEASE BROTHER INTERRUPTED MADEMOISELLE
WHEN
THE GENTLEMAN OF A FAMILY READS THE LADIES SHOULD ALWAYS
SEW CAROLINE DEAR CHILD TAKE YOUR EMBROIDERY
YOU MAY GET THREE
SPRIGS DONE TO NIGHT
CAROLINE LOOKED DISMAYED
I CAN'T SEE BY LAMP LIGHT MY EYES ARE TIRED
AND I CAN'T DO TWO THINGS WELL AT ONCE
IF I SEW I CANNOT LISTEN IF I
LISTEN I CANNOT SEW
FI DONC QUEL ENFANTILLAGE BEGAN HORTENSE
MR
MOORE AS USUAL
SUAVELY INTERPOSED
PERMIT HER TO NEGLECT THE EMBROIDERY FOR THIS EVENING
I WISH HER WHOLE
ATTENTION TO BE FIXED ON MY ACCENT AND TO ENSURE THIS SHE MUST FOLLOW
THE READING WITH HER EYES SHE MUST LOOK AT THE BOOK
HE PLACED IT BETWEEN THEM REPOSED HIS ARM ON THE BACK OF CAROLINE'S
CHAIR AND THUS BEGAN TO READ
THE VERY FIRST SCENE IN CORIOLANUS CAME WITH SMART RELISH TO HIS
INTELLECTUAL PALATE AND STILL AS HE READ HE WARMED
HE DELIVERED THE
HAUGHTY SPEECH OF CAIUS MARCIUS TO THE STARVING CITIZENS WITH UNCTION
HE DID NOT SAY HE THOUGHT HIS IRRATIONAL PRIDE RIGHT BUT HE SEEMED TO
FEEL IT SO
CAROLINE LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH A SINGULAR SMILE
THERE'S A VICIOUS POINT HIT ALREADY SHE SAID
YOU SYMPATHIZE WITH
THAT PROUD PATRICIAN WHO DOES NOT SYMPATHIZE WITH HIS FAMISHED
FELLOW MEN AND INSULTS THEM
THERE GO ON HE PROCEEDED
THE WARLIKE
PORTIONS DID NOT ROUSE HIM MUCH HE SAID ALL THAT WAS OUT OF DATE OR
SHOULD BE THE SPIRIT DISPLAYED WAS BARBAROUS YET THE ENCOUNTER
SINGLE HANDED BETWEEN MARCIUS AND TULLUS AUFIDIUS HE DELIGHTED IN
AS HE
ADVANCED HE FORGOT TO CRITICISE IT WAS EVIDENT HE APPRECIATED THE
POWER THE TRUTH OF EACH PORTION AND STEPPING OUT OF THE NARROW LINE
OF PRIVATE PREJUDICES BEGAN TO REVEL IN THE LARGE PICTURE OF HUMAN
NATURE TO FEEL THE REALITY STAMPED UPON THE CHARACTERS WHO WERE
SPEAKING FROM THAT PAGE BEFORE HIM
HE DID NOT READ THE COMIC SCENES WELL AND CAROLINE TAKING THE BOOK OUT
OF HIS HAND READ THESE PARTS FOR HIM
FROM HER HE SEEMED TO ENJOY THEM
AND INDEED SHE GAVE THEM WITH A SPIRIT NO ONE COULD HAVE EXPECTED OF
HER WITH A PITHY EXPRESSION WITH WHICH SHE SEEMED GIFTED ON THE SPOT
AND FOR THAT BRIEF MOMENT ONLY
IT MAY BE REMARKED IN PASSING THAT THE
GENERAL CHARACTER OF HER CONVERSATION THAT EVENING WHETHER SERIOUS OR
SPRIGHTLY GRAVE OR GAY WAS AS OF SOMETHING UNTAUGHT UNSTUDIED
INTUITIVE FITFUL WHEN ONCE GONE NO MORE TO BE REPRODUCED AS IT HAD
BEEN THAN THE GLANCING RAY OF THE METEOR THAN THE TINTS OF THE DEW GEM
THAN THE COLOUR OR FORM OF THE SUNSET CLOUD THAN THE FLEETING AND
GLITTERING RIPPLE VARYING THE FLOW OF A RIVULET
CORIOLANUS IN GLORY CORIOLANUS IN DISASTER CORIOLANUS BANISHED
FOLLOWED LIKE GIANT SHADES ONE AFTER THE OTHER
BEFORE THE VISION OF THE
BANISHED MAN MOORE'S SPIRIT SEEMED TO PAUSE
HE STOOD ON THE HEARTH OF
AUFIDIUS'S HALL FACING THE IMAGE OF GREATNESS FALLEN BUT GREATER THAN
EVER IN THAT LOW ESTATE
HE SAW THE GRIM APPEARANCE THE DARK FACE
BEARING COMMAND IN IT THE NOBLE VESSEL WITH ITS TACKLE TORN WITH
THE REVENGE OF CAIUS MARCIUS MOORE PERFECTLY SYMPATHIZED HE WAS NOT
SCANDALIZED BY IT AND AGAIN CAROLINE WHISPERED THERE I SEE ANOTHER
GLIMPSE OF BROTHERHOOD IN ERROR
THE MARCH ON ROME THE MOTHER'S SUPPLICATION THE LONG RESISTANCE THE
FINAL YIELDING OF BAD PASSIONS TO GOOD WHICH EVER MUST BE THE CASE IN A
NATURE WORTHY THE EPITHET OF NOBLE THE RAGE OF AUFIDIUS AT WHAT HE
CONSIDERED HIS ALLY'S WEAKNESS THE DEATH OF CORIOLANUS THE FINAL
SORROW OF HIS GREAT ENEMY ALL SCENES MADE OF CONDENSED TRUTH AND
STRENGTH CAME ON IN SUCCESSION AND CARRIED WITH THEM IN THEIR DEEP
FAST FLOW THE HEART AND MIND OF READER AND LISTENER
NOW HAVE YOU FELT SHAKESPEARE ASKED CAROLINE SOME TEN MINUTES AFTER
HER COUSIN HAD CLOSED THE BOOK
I THINK SO
AND HAVE YOU FELT ANYTHING IN CORIOLANUS LIKE YOU
PERHAPS I HAVE
WAS HE NOT FAULTY AS WELL AS GREAT
MOORE NODDED
AND WHAT WAS HIS FAULT WHAT MADE HIM HATED BY THE CITIZENS WHAT
CAUSED HIM TO BE BANISHED BY HIS COUNTRYMEN
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS
I ASK AGAIN
'WHETHER WAS IT PRIDE
WHICH OUT OF DAILY FORTUNE EVER TAINTS
THE HAPPY MAN WHETHER DEFECT OF JUDGMENT
TO FAIL IN THE DISPOSING OF THOSE CHANCES
WHICH HE WAS LORD OF OR WHETHER NATURE
NOT TO BE OTHER THAN ONE THING NOT MOVING
FROM THE CASQUE TO THE CUSHION BUT COMMANDING PEACE
EVEN WITH THE SAME AUSTERITY AND GARB
AS HE CONTROLLED THE WAR
WELL ANSWER YOURSELF SPHINX
IT WAS A SPICE OF ALL AND YOU MUST NOT BE PROUD TO YOUR WORKPEOPLE
YOU MUST NOT NEGLECT CHANCES OF SOOTHING THEM AND YOU MUST NOT BE OF AN
INFLEXIBLE NATURE UTTERING A REQUEST AS AUSTERELY AS IF IT WERE A
COMMAND
THAT IS THE MORAL YOU TACK TO THE PLAY
WHAT PUTS SUCH NOTIONS INTO
YOUR HEAD
A WISH FOR YOUR GOOD A CARE FOR YOUR SAFETY DEAR ROBERT AND A FEAR
CAUSED BY MANY THINGS WHICH I HAVE HEARD LATELY THAT YOU WILL COME TO
HARM
WHO TELLS YOU THESE THINGS
I HEAR MY UNCLE TALK ABOUT YOU
HE PRAISES YOUR HARD SPIRIT YOUR
DETERMINED CAST OF MIND YOUR SCORN OF LOW ENEMIES YOUR RESOLUTION NOT
'TO TRUCKLE TO THE MOB AS HE SAYS
AND WOULD YOU HAVE ME TRUCKLE TO THEM
NO NOT FOR THE WORLD
I NEVER WISH YOU TO LOWER YOURSELF BUT SOMEHOW
I CANNOT HELP THINKING IT UNJUST TO INCLUDE ALL POOR WORKING PEOPLE
UNDER THE GENERAL AND INSULTING NAME OF 'THE MOB AND CONTINUALLY TO
THINK OF THEM AND TREAT THEM HAUGHTILY
YOU ARE A LITTLE DEMOCRAT CAROLINE
IF YOUR UNCLE KNEW WHAT WOULD HE
SAY
I RARELY TALK TO MY UNCLE AS YOU KNOW AND NEVER ABOUT SUCH THINGS
HE
THINKS EVERYTHING BUT SEWING AND COOKING ABOVE WOMEN'S COMPREHENSION
AND OUT OF THEIR LINE
AND DO YOU FANCY YOU COMPREHEND THE SUBJECTS ON WHICH YOU ADVISE ME
AS FAR AS THEY CONCERN YOU I COMPREHEND THEM
I KNOW IT WOULD BE
BETTER FOR YOU TO BE LOVED BY YOUR WORKPEOPLE THAN TO BE HATED BY THEM
AND I AM SURE THAT KINDNESS IS MORE LIKELY TO WIN THEIR REGARD THAN
PRIDE
IF YOU WERE PROUD AND COLD TO ME AND HORTENSE SHOULD WE LOVE
YOU WHEN YOU ARE COLD TO ME AS YOU ARE SOMETIMES CAN I VENTURE TO
BE AFFECTIONATE IN RETURN
NOW LINA I'VE HAD MY LESSON BOTH IN LANGUAGES AND ETHICS WITH A
TOUCH ON POLITICS IT IS YOUR TURN
HORTENSE TELLS ME YOU WERE MUCH
TAKEN BY A LITTLE PIECE OF POETRY YOU LEARNED THE OTHER DAY A PIECE BY
POOR ANDR CHNIER 'LA JEUNE CAPTIVE DO YOU REMEMBER IT STILL
I THINK SO
REPEAT IT THEN
TAKE YOUR TIME AND MIND YOUR ACCENT ESPECIALLY LET US
HAVE NO ENGLISH U 'S
CAROLINE BEGINNING IN A LOW RATHER TREMULOUS VOICE BUT GAINING
COURAGE AS SHE PROCEEDED REPEATED THE SWEET VERSES OF CHNIER
THE LAST
THREE STANZAS SHE REHEARSED WELL
MON BEAU VOYAGE ENCORE EST SI LOIN DE SA FIN
JE PARS ET DES ORMEAUX QUI BORDENT LE CHEMIN
J'AI PASS LE PREMIERS PEINE
AU BANQUET DE LA VIE PEINE COMMENC
UN INSTANT SEULEMENT MES LVRES ONT PRESS
LA COUPE EN MES MAINS ENCORE PLEINE
JE NE SUIS QU'AU PRINTEMPS JE VEUX VOIR LA MOISSON
ET COMME LE SOLEIL DE SAISON EN SAISON
JE VEUX ACHEVER MON ANNE
BRILLANTE SUR MA TIGE ET L'HONNEUR DU JARDIN
JE N'AI VU LUIRE ENCORE QUE LES FEUX DU MATIN
JE VEUX ACHEVER MA JOURNE
MOORE LISTENED AT FIRST WITH HIS EYES CAST DOWN BUT SOON HE FURTIVELY
RAISED THEM
LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR HE COULD WATCH CAROLINE WITHOUT
HER PERCEIVING WHERE HIS GAZE WAS FIXED
HER CHEEK HAD A COLOUR HER
EYES A LIGHT HER COUNTENANCE AN EXPRESSION THIS EVENING WHICH WOULD
HAVE MADE EVEN PLAIN FEATURES STRIKING BUT THERE WAS NOT THE GRIEVOUS
DEFECT OF PLAINNESS TO PARDON IN HER CASE
THE SUNSHINE WAS NOT SHED ON
ROUGH BARRENNESS IT FELL ON SOFT BLOOM
EACH LINEAMENT WAS TURNED WITH
GRACE THE WHOLE ASPECT WAS PLEASING
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT ANIMATED
INTERESTED TOUCHED SHE MIGHT BE CALLED BEAUTIFUL
SUCH A FACE WAS
CALCULATED TO AWAKEN NOT ONLY THE CALM SENTIMENT OF ESTEEM THE DISTANT
ONE OF ADMIRATION BUT SOME FEELING MORE TENDER GENIAL
INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP PERHAPS AFFECTION INTEREST
WHEN SHE HAD
FINISHED SHE TURNED TO MOORE AND MET HIS EYE
IS THAT PRETTY WELL REPEATED SHE INQUIRED SMILING LIKE ANY HAPPY
DOCILE CHILD
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHY DON'T YOU KNOW HAVE YOU NOT LISTENED
YES AND LOOKED
YOU ARE FOND OF POETRY LINA
WHEN I MEET WITH REAL POETRY I CANNOT REST TILL I HAVE LEARNED IT BY
HEART AND SO MADE IT PARTLY MINE
MR
MOORE NOW SAT SILENT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
IT STRUCK NINE O'CLOCK
SARAH ENTERED AND SAID THAT MR
HELSTONE'S SERVANT WAS COME FOR MISS
CAROLINE
THEN THE EVENING IS GONE ALREADY SHE OBSERVED AND IT WILL BE LONG
I SUPPOSE BEFORE I PASS ANOTHER HERE
HORTENSE HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME NODDING OVER HER KNITTING FALLEN INTO A
DOZE NOW SHE MADE NO RESPONSE TO THE REMARK
YOU WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO COME HERE OFTENER OF AN EVENING
INQUIRED ROBERT AS HE TOOK HER FOLDED MANTLE FROM THE SIDE TABLE WHERE
IT STILL LAY AND CAREFULLY WRAPPED IT ROUND HER
I LIKE TO COME HERE BUT I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE INTRUSIVE
I AM NOT
HINTING TO BE ASKED YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT
OH I UNDERSTAND THEE CHILD
YOU SOMETIMES LECTURE ME FOR WISHING TO
BE RICH LINA BUT IF I WERE RICH YOU SHOULD LIVE HERE ALWAYS AT ANY
RATE YOU SHOULD LIVE WITH ME WHEREVER MY HABITATION MIGHT BE
THAT WOULD BE PLEASANT AND IF YOU WERE POOR EVER SO POOR IT WOULD
STILL BE PLEASANT
GOOD NIGHT ROBERT
I PROMISED TO WALK WITH YOU UP TO THE RECTORY
I KNOW YOU DID BUT I THOUGHT YOU HAD FORGOTTEN AND I HARDLY KNEW HOW
TO REMIND YOU THOUGH I WISHED TO DO IT
BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO IT IS
A COLD NIGHT AND AS FANNY IS COME THERE IS NO NECESSITY
HERE IS YOUR MUFF DON'T WAKE HORTENSE COME
THE HALF MILE TO THE RECTORY WAS SOON TRAVERSED
THEY PARTED IN THE
GARDEN WITHOUT KISS SCARCELY WITH A PRESSURE OF HANDS YET ROBERT SENT
HIS COUSIN IN EXCITED AND JOYOUSLY TROUBLED
HE HAD BEEN SINGULARLY KIND
TO HER THAT DAY NOT IN PHRASE COMPLIMENT PROFESSION BUT IN MANNER
IN LOOK AND IN SOFT AND FRIENDLY TONES
FOR HIMSELF HE CAME HOME GRAVE ALMOST MOROSE
AS HE STOOD LEANING ON
HIS OWN YARD GATE MUSING IN THE WATERY MOONLIGHT ALL ALONE THE HUSHED
DARK MILL BEFORE HIM THE HILL ENVIRONED HOLLOW ROUND HE EXCLAIMED
ABRUPTLY
THIS WON'T DO THERE'S WEAKNESS THERE'S DOWNRIGHT RUIN IN ALL THIS
HOWEVER HE ADDED DROPPING HIS VOICE THE FRENZY IS QUITE TEMPORARY
I KNOW IT VERY WELL I HAVE HAD IT BEFORE
IT WILL BE GONE TO MORROW
CHAPTER VII
THE CURATES AT TEA
CAROLINE HELSTONE WAS JUST EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND AT EIGHTEEN THE TRUE
NARRATIVE OF LIFE IS YET TO BE COMMENCED
BEFORE THAT TIME WE SIT
LISTENING TO A TALE A MARVELLOUS FICTION DELIGHTFUL SOMETIMES AND SAD
SOMETIMES ALMOST ALWAYS UNREAL
BEFORE THAT TIME OUR WORLD IS HEROIC
ITS INHABITANTS HALF DIVINE OR SEMI DEMON ITS SCENES ARE DREAM SCENES
DARKER WOODS AND STRANGER HILLS BRIGHTER SKIES MORE DANGEROUS WATERS
SWEETER FLOWERS MORE TEMPTING FRUITS WIDER PLAINS DREARIER DESERTS
SUNNIER FIELDS THAN ARE FOUND IN NATURE OVERSPREAD OUR ENCHANTED GLOBE
WHAT A MOON WE GAZE ON BEFORE THAT TIME HOW THE TREMBLING OF OUR HEARTS
AT HER ASPECT BEARS WITNESS TO ITS UNUTTERABLE BEAUTY AS TO OUR SUN IT
IS A BURNING HEAVEN THE WORLD OF GODS
AT THAT TIME AT EIGHTEEN DRAWING NEAR THE CONFINES OF ILLUSIVE VOID
DREAMS ELF LAND LIES BEHIND US THE SHORES OF REALITY RISE IN FRONT
THESE SHORES ARE YET DISTANT THEY LOOK SO BLUE SOFT GENTLE WE LONG
TO REACH THEM
IN SUNSHINE WE SEE A GREENNESS BENEATH THE AZURE AS OF
SPRING MEADOWS WE CATCH GLIMPSES OF SILVER LINES AND IMAGINE THE ROLL
OF LIVING WATERS
COULD WE BUT REACH THIS LAND WE THINK TO HUNGER AND
THIRST NO MORE WHEREAS MANY A WILDERNESS AND OFTEN THE FLOOD OF DEATH
OR SOME STREAM OF SORROW AS COLD AND ALMOST AS BLACK AS DEATH IS TO BE
CROSSED ERE TRUE BLISS CAN BE TASTED
EVERY JOY THAT LIFE GIVES MUST BE
EARNED ERE IT IS SECURED AND HOW HARDLY EARNED THOSE ONLY KNOW WHO
HAVE WRESTLED FOR GREAT PRIZES
THE HEART'S BLOOD MUST GEM WITH RED
BEADS THE BROW OF THE COMBATANT BEFORE THE WREATH OF VICTORY RUSTLES
OVER IT
AT EIGHTEEN WE ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS
HOPE WHEN SHE SMILES ON US AND
PROMISES HAPPINESS TO MORROW IS IMPLICITLY BELIEVED LOVE WHEN HE
COMES WANDERING LIKE A LOST ANGEL TO OUR DOOR IS AT ONCE ADMITTED
WELCOMED EMBRACED
HIS QUIVER IS NOT SEEN IF HIS ARROWS PENETRATE
THEIR WOUND IS LIKE A THRILL OF NEW LIFE
THERE ARE NO FEARS OF POISON
NONE OF THE BARB WHICH NO LEECH'S HAND CAN EXTRACT
THAT PERILOUS
PASSION AN AGONY EVER IN SOME OF ITS PHASES WITH MANY AN AGONY
THROUGHOUT IS BELIEVED TO BE AN UNQUALIFIED GOOD
IN SHORT AT EIGHTEEN
THE SCHOOL OF EXPERIENCE IS TO BE ENTERED AND HER HUMBLING CRUSHING
GRINDING BUT YET PURIFYING AND INVIGORATING LESSONS ARE YET TO BE
LEARNED
ALAS EXPERIENCE NO OTHER MENTOR HAS SO WASTED AND FROZEN A FACE AS
YOURS NONE WEARS A ROBE SO BLACK NONE BEARS A ROD SO HEAVY NONE WITH
HAND SO INEXORABLE DRAWS THE NOVICE SO STERNLY TO HIS TASK AND FORCES
HIM WITH AUTHORITY SO RESISTLESS TO ITS ACQUIREMENT
IT IS BY YOUR
INSTRUCTIONS ALONE THAT MAN OR WOMAN CAN EVER FIND A SAFE TRACK THROUGH
LIFE'S WILDS WITHOUT IT HOW THEY STUMBLE HOW THEY STRAY ON WHAT
FORBIDDEN GROUNDS DO THEY INTRUDE DOWN WHAT DREAD DECLIVITIES ARE THEY
HURLED
CAROLINE HAVING BEEN CONVOYED HOME BY ROBERT HAD NO WISH TO PASS WHAT
REMAINED OF THE EVENING WITH HER UNCLE
THE ROOM IN WHICH HE SAT WAS
VERY SACRED GROUND TO HER SHE SELDOM INTRUDED ON IT AND TO NIGHT SHE
KEPT ALOOF TILL THE BELL RANG FOR PRAYERS
PART OF THE EVENING CHURCH
SERVICE WAS THE FORM OF WORSHIP OBSERVED IN MR
HELSTONE'S HOUSEHOLD
HE
READ IT IN HIS USUAL NASAL VOICE CLEAR LOUD AND MONOTONOUS
THE RITE
OVER HIS NIECE ACCORDING TO HER WONT STEPPED UP TO HIM
GOOD NIGHT UNCLE
HEY YOU'VE BEEN GADDING ABROAD ALL DAY VISITING DINING OUT AND WHAT
NOT
ONLY AT THE COTTAGE
AND HAVE YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSONS
YES
AND MADE A SHIRT
ONLY PART OF ONE
WELL THAT WILL DO
STICK TO THE NEEDLE LEARN SHIRT MAKING AND
GOWN MAKING AND PIECRUST MAKING AND YOU'LL BE A CLEVER WOMAN SOME DAY
GO TO BED NOW
I'M BUSY WITH A PAMPHLET HERE
PRESENTLY THE NIECE WAS ENCLOSED IN HER SMALL BEDROOM THE DOOR BOLTED
HER WHITE DRESSING GOWN ASSUMED HER LONG HAIR LOOSENED AND FALLING
THICK SOFT AND WAVY TO HER WAIST AND AS RESTING FROM THE TASK OF
COMBING IT OUT SHE LEANED HER CHECK ON HER HAND AND FIXED HER EYES ON
THE CARPET BEFORE HER ROSE AND CLOSE AROUND HER DREW THE VISIONS WE
SEE AT EIGHTEEN YEARS
HER THOUGHTS WERE SPEAKING WITH HER SPEAKING PLEASANTLY AS IT SEEMED
FOR SHE SMILED AS SHE LISTENED
SHE LOOKED PRETTY MEDITATING THUS BUT A
BRIGHTER THING THAN SHE WAS IN THAT APARTMENT THE SPIRIT OF YOUTHFUL
HOPE
ACCORDING TO THIS FLATTERING PROPHET SHE WAS TO KNOW
DISAPPOINTMENT TO FEEL CHILL NO MORE SHE HAD ENTERED ON THE DAWN OF A
SUMMER DAY NO FALSE DAWN BUT THE TRUE SPRING OF MORNING AND HER SUN
WOULD QUICKLY RISE
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER NOW TO SUSPECT THAT SHE WAS THE
SPORT OF DELUSION HER EXPECTATIONS SEEMED WARRANTED THE FOUNDATION ON
WHICH THEY RESTED APPEARED SOLID
WHEN PEOPLE LOVE THE NEXT STEP IS THEY MARRY WAS HER ARGUMENT
NOW
I LOVE ROBERT AND I FEEL SURE THAT ROBERT LOVES ME
I HAVE THOUGHT SO
MANY A TIME BEFORE TO DAY I FELT IT
WHEN I LOOKED UP AT HIM AFTER
REPEATING CHNIER'S POEM HIS EYES WHAT HANDSOME EYES HE HAS SENT THE
TRUTH THROUGH MY HEART
SOMETIMES I AM AFRAID TO SPEAK TO HIM LEST I
SHOULD BE TOO FRANK LEST I SHOULD SEEM FORWARD FOR I HAVE MORE THAN
ONCE REGRETTED BITTERLY OVERFLOWING SUPERFLUOUS WORDS AND FEARED I HAD
SAID MORE THAN HE EXPECTED ME TO SAY AND THAT HE WOULD DISAPPROVE WHAT
HE MIGHT DEEM MY INDISCRETION NOW TO NIGHT I COULD HAVE VENTURED TO
EXPRESS ANY THOUGHT HE WAS SO INDULGENT
HOW KIND HE WAS AS WE WALKED
UP THE LANE HE DOES NOT FLATTER OR SAY FOOLISH THINGS HIS LOVE MAKING
FRIENDSHIP I MEAN OF COURSE I DON'T YET ACCOUNT HIM MY LOVER BUT I
HOPE HE WILL BE SO SOME DAY IS NOT LIKE WHAT WE READ OF IN BOOKS IT
IS FAR BETTER ORIGINAL QUIET MANLY SINCERE
I DO LIKE HIM I WOULD
BE AN EXCELLENT WIFE TO HIM IF HE DID MARRY ME I WOULD TELL HIM OF HIS
FAULTS FOR HE HAS A FEW FAULTS BUT I WOULD STUDY HIS COMFORT AND
CHERISH HIM AND DO MY BEST TO MAKE HIM HAPPY
NOW I AM SURE HE WILL
NOT BE COLD TO MORROW
I FEEL ALMOST CERTAIN THAT TO MORROW EVENING HE
WILL EITHER COME HERE OR ASK ME TO GO THERE
SHE RECOMMENCED COMBING HER HAIR LONG AS A MERMAID'S
TURNING HER HEAD
AS SHE ARRANGED IT SHE SAW HER OWN FACE AND FORM IN THE GLASS
SUCH
REFLECTIONS ARE SOBERIZING TO PLAIN PEOPLE THEIR OWN EYES ARE NOT
ENCHANTED WITH THE IMAGE THEY ARE CONFIDENT THEN THAT THE EYES OF
OTHERS CAN SEE IN IT NO FASCINATION
BUT THE FAIR MUST NATURALLY DRAW
OTHER CONCLUSIONS THE PICTURE IS CHARMING AND MUST CHARM
CAROLINE SAW
A SHAPE A HEAD THAT DAGUERREOTYPED IN THAT ATTITUDE AND WITH THAT
EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN LOVELY
SHE COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT DERIVE
FROM THE SPECTACLE CONFIRMATION TO HER HOPES
IT WAS THEN IN
UNDIMINISHED GLADNESS SHE SOUGHT HER COUCH
AND IN UNDIMINISHED GLADNESS SHE ROSE THE NEXT DAY
AS SHE ENTERED HER
UNCLE'S BREAKFAST ROOM AND WITH SOFT CHEERFULNESS WISHED HIM
GOOD MORNING EVEN THAT LITTLE MAN OF BRONZE HIMSELF THOUGHT FOR AN
INSTANT HIS NIECE WAS GROWING A FINE GIRL GENERALLY SHE WAS QUIET
AND TIMID WITH HIM VERY DOCILE BUT NOT COMMUNICATIVE THIS MORNING
HOWEVER SHE FOUND MANY THINGS TO SAY
SLIGHT TOPICS ALONE MIGHT BE
DISCUSSED BETWEEN THEM FOR WITH A WOMAN A GIRL MR
HELSTONE WOULD
TOUCH ON NO OTHER
SHE HAD TAKEN AN EARLY WALK IN THE GARDEN AND SHE
TOLD HIM WHAT FLOWERS WERE BEGINNING TO SPRING THERE SHE INQUIRED WHEN
THE GARDENER WAS TO COME AND TRIM THE BORDERS SHE INFORMED HIM THAT
CERTAIN STARLINGS WERE BEGINNING TO BUILD THEIR NESTS IN THE
CHURCH TOWER BRIARFIELD CHURCH WAS CLOSE TO BRIARFIELD RECTORY SHE
WONDERED THE TOLLING OF THE BELLS IN THE BELFRY DID NOT SCARE THEM
MR
HELSTONE OPINED THAT THEY WERE LIKE OTHER FOOLS WHO HAD JUST
PAIRED INSENSIBLE TO INCONVENIENCE JUST FOR THE MOMENT CAROLINE MADE
PERHAPS A LITTLE TOO COURAGEOUS BY HER TEMPORARY GOOD SPIRITS HERE
HAZARDED A REMARK OF A KIND SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE VENTURED TO MAKE ON
OBSERVATIONS DROPPED BY HER REVERED RELATIVE
UNCLE SAID SHE WHENEVER YOU SPEAK OF MARRIAGE YOU SPEAK OF IT
SCORNFULLY
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULDN'T MARRY
IT IS DECIDEDLY THE WISEST PLAN TO REMAIN SINGLE ESPECIALLY FOR
WOMEN
ARE ALL MARRIAGES UNHAPPY
MILLIONS OF MARRIAGES ARE UNHAPPY
IF EVERYBODY CONFESSED THE TRUTH
PERHAPS ALL ARE MORE OR LESS SO
YOU ARE ALWAYS VEXED WHEN YOU ARE ASKED TO COME AND MARRY A COUPLE
WHY
BECAUSE ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO ACT AS ACCESSORY TO THE COMMISSION OF A
PIECE OF PURE FOLLY
MR
HELSTONE SPOKE SO READILY HE SEEMED RATHER GLAD OF THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GIVE HIS NIECE A PIECE OF HIS MIND ON THIS POINT
EMBOLDENED BY THE
IMPUNITY WHICH HAD HITHERTO ATTENDED HER QUESTIONS SHE WENT A LITTLE
FURTHER
BUT WHY SAID SHE SHOULD IT BE PURE FOLLY IF TWO PEOPLE LIKE EACH
OTHER WHY SHOULDN'T THEY CONSENT TO LIVE TOGETHER
THEY TIRE OF EACH OTHER THEY TIRE OF EACH OTHER IN A MONTH
A
YOKEFELLOW IS NOT A COMPANION HE OR SHE IS A FELLOW SUFFERER
IT WAS BY NO MEANS NAVE SIMPLICITY WHICH INSPIRED CAROLINE'S NEXT
REMARK IT WAS A SENSE OF ANTIPATHY TO SUCH OPINIONS AND OF DISPLEASURE
AT HIM WHO HELD THEM
ONE WOULD THINK YOU HAD NEVER BEEN MARRIED UNCLE
ONE WOULD THINK YOU
WERE AN OLD BACHELOR
PRACTICALLY I AM SO
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN MARRIED
WHY WERE YOU SO INCONSISTENT AS TO MARRY
EVERY MAN IS MAD ONCE OR TWICE IN HIS LIFE
SO YOU TIRED OF MY AUNT AND MY AUNT OF YOU AND YOU WERE MISERABLE
TOGETHER
MR
HELSTONE PUSHED OUT HIS CYNICAL LIP WRINKLED HIS BROWN FOREHEAD
AND GAVE AN INARTICULATE GRUNT
DID SHE NOT SUIT YOU WAS SHE NOT GOOD TEMPERED DID YOU NOT GET USED
TO HER WERE YOU NOT SORRY WHEN SHE DIED
CAROLINE SAID MR
HELSTONE BRINGING HIS HAND SLOWLY DOWN TO WITHIN
AN INCH OR TWO OF THE TABLE AND THEN SMITING IT SUDDENLY ON THE
MAHOGANY UNDERSTAND THIS IT IS VULGAR AND PUERILE TO CONFOUND
GENERALS WITH PARTICULARS
IN EVERY CASE THERE IS THE RULE AND THERE ARE
THE EXCEPTIONS
YOUR QUESTIONS ARE STUPID AND BABYISH
RING THE BELL IF
YOU HAVE DONE BREAKFAST
THE BREAKFAST WAS TAKEN AWAY AND THAT MEAL OVER IT WAS THE GENERAL
CUSTOM OF UNCLE AND NIECE TO SEPARATE AND NOT TO MEET AGAIN TILL
DINNER BUT TO DAY THE NIECE INSTEAD OF QUITTING THE ROOM WENT TO THE
WINDOW SEAT AND SAT DOWN THERE
MR
HELSTONE LOOKED ROUND UNEASILY ONCE
OR TWICE AS IF HE WISHED HER AWAY BUT SHE WAS GAZING FROM THE WINDOW
AND DID NOT SEEM TO MIND HIM SO HE CONTINUED THE PERUSAL OF HIS MORNING
PAPER A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ONE IT CHANCED TO BE AS NEW MOVEMENTS
HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE IN THE PENINSULA AND CERTAIN COLUMNS OF THE
JOURNAL WERE RICH IN LONG DISPATCHES FROM GENERAL LORD WELLINGTON
HE
LITTLE KNEW MEANTIME WHAT THOUGHTS WERE BUSY IN HIS NIECE'S
MIND THOUGHTS THE CONVERSATION OF THE PAST HALF HOUR HAD REVIVED BUT
NOT GENERATED TUMULTUOUS WERE THEY NOW AS DISTURBED BEES IN A HIVE
BUT IT WAS YEARS SINCE THEY HAD FIRST MADE THEIR CELLS IN HER BRAIN
SHE WAS REVIEWING HIS CHARACTER HIS DISPOSITION REPEATING HIS
SENTIMENTS ON MARRIAGE
MANY A TIME HAD SHE REVIEWED THEM BEFORE AND
SOUNDED THE GULF BETWEEN HER OWN MIND AND HIS AND THEN ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE WIDE AND DEEP CHASM SHE HAD SEEN AND SHE NOW SAW ANOTHER
FIGURE STANDING BESIDE HER UNCLE'S A STRANGE SHAPE DIM SINISTER
SCARCELY EARTHLY THE HALF REMEMBERED IMAGE OF HER OWN FATHER JAMES
HELSTONE MATTHEWSON HELSTONE'S BROTHER
RUMOURS HAD REACHED HER EAR OF WHAT THAT FATHER'S CHARACTER WAS OLD
SERVANTS HAD DROPPED HINTS SHE KNEW TOO THAT HE WAS NOT A GOOD MAN
AND THAT HE WAS NEVER KIND TO HER
SHE RECOLLECTED A DARK RECOLLECTION
IT WAS SOME WEEKS THAT SHE HAD SPENT WITH HIM IN A GREAT TOWN
SOMEWHERE WHEN SHE HAD HAD NO MAID TO DRESS HER OR TAKE CARE OF HER
WHEN SHE HAD BEEN SHUT UP DAY AND NIGHT IN A HIGH GARRET ROOM WITHOUT
A CARPET WITH A BARE UNCURTAINED BED AND SCARCELY ANY OTHER FURNITURE
WHEN HE WENT OUT EARLY EVERY MORNING AND OFTEN FORGOT TO RETURN AND
GIVE HER HER DINNER DURING THE DAY AND AT NIGHT WHEN HE CAME BACK WAS
LIKE A MADMAN FURIOUS TERRIBLE OR STILL MORE PAINFUL LIKE AN IDIOT
IMBECILE SENSELESS
SHE KNEW SHE HAD FALLEN ILL IN THIS PLACE AND THAT
ONE NIGHT WHEN SHE WAS VERY SICK HE HAD COME RAVING INTO THE ROOM AND
SAID HE WOULD KILL HER FOR SHE WAS A BURDEN TO HIM
HER SCREAMS HAD
BROUGHT AID AND FROM THE MOMENT SHE WAS THEN RESCUED FROM HIM SHE HAD
NEVER SEEN HIM EXCEPT AS A DEAD MAN IN HIS COFFIN
THAT WAS HER FATHER
ALSO SHE HAD A MOTHER THOUGH MR
HELSTONE NEVER
SPOKE TO HER OF THAT MOTHER THOUGH SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER HAVING SEEN
HER BUT THAT SHE WAS ALIVE SHE KNEW
THIS MOTHER WAS THEN THE
DRUNKARD'S WIFE
WHAT HAD THEIR MARRIAGE BEEN CAROLINE TURNING FROM
THE LATTICE WHENCE SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING THE STARLINGS THOUGH WITHOUT
SEEING THEM IN A LOW VOICE AND WITH A SAD BITTER TONE THUS BROKE
THE SILENCE OF THE ROOM
YOU TERM MARRIAGE MISERABLE I SUPPOSE FROM WHAT YOU SAW OF MY FATHER
AND MOTHER'S
IF MY MOTHER SUFFERED WHAT I SUFFERED WHEN I WAS WITH
PAPA SHE MUST HAVE HAD A DREADFUL LIFE
MR
HELSTONE THUS ADDRESSED WHEELED ABOUT IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED
OVER HIS SPECTACLES AT HIS NIECE
HE WAS TAKEN ABACK
HER FATHER AND MOTHER WHAT HAD PUT IT INTO HER HEAD TO MENTION HER
FATHER AND MOTHER OF WHOM HE HAD NEVER DURING THE TWELVE YEARS SHE HAD
LIVED WITH HIM SPOKEN TO HER THAT THE THOUGHTS WERE SELF MATURED THAT
SHE HAD ANY RECOLLECTIONS OR SPECULATIONS ABOUT HER PARENTS HE COULD
NOT FANCY
YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER WHO HAS BEEN TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THEM
NOBODY BUT I REMEMBER SOMETHING OF WHAT PAPA WAS AND I PITY MAMMA
WHERE IS SHE
THIS WHERE IS SHE HAD BEEN ON CAROLINE'S LIPS HUNDREDS OF TIMES
BEFORE BUT TILL NOW SHE HAD NEVER UTTERED IT
I HARDLY KNOW RETURNED MR
HELSTONE I WAS LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH
HER
I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HER FOR YEARS BUT WHEREVER SHE IS SHE
THINKS NOTHING OF YOU SHE NEVER INQUIRES ABOUT YOU
I HAVE REASON TO
BELIEVE SHE DOES NOT WISH TO SEE YOU
COME IT IS SCHOOL TIME
YOU GO TO
YOUR COUSIN AT TEN DON'T YOU THE CLOCK HAS STRUCK
PERHAPS CAROLINE WOULD HAVE SAID MORE BUT FANNY COMING IN INFORMED
HER MASTER THAT THE CHURCHWARDENS WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM IN THE VESTRY
HE HASTENED TO JOIN THEM AND HIS NIECE PRESENTLY SET OUT FOR THE
COTTAGE
THE ROAD FROM THE RECTORY TO HOLLOW'S MILL INCLINED DOWNWARDS SHE RAN
THEREFORE ALMOST ALL THE WAY
EXERCISE THE FRESH AIR THE THOUGHT OF
SEEING ROBERT AT LEAST OF BEING ON HIS PREMISES IN HIS VICINAGE
REVIVED HER SOMEWHAT DEPRESSED SPIRITS QUICKLY
ARRIVING IN SIGHT OF THE
WHITE HOUSE AND WITHIN HEARING OF THE THUNDERING MILL AND ITS RUSHING
WATERCOURSE THE FIRST THING SHE SAW WAS MOORE AT HIS GARDEN GATE
THERE
HE STOOD IN HIS BELTED HOLLAND BLOUSE A LIGHT CAP COVERING HIS HEAD
WHICH UNDRESS COSTUME SUITED HIM
HE WAS LOOKING DOWN THE LANE NOT IN
THE DIRECTION OF HIS COUSIN'S APPROACH
SHE STOPPED WITHDRAWING A
LITTLE BEHIND A WILLOW AND STUDIED HIS APPEARANCE
HE HAS NOT HIS PEER SHE THOUGHT
HE IS AS HANDSOME AS HE IS
INTELLIGENT
WHAT A KEEN EYE HE HAS WHAT CLEARLY CUT SPIRITED
FEATURES THIN AND SERIOUS BUT GRACEFUL I DO LIKE HIS FACE I DO LIKE
HIS ASPECT I DO LIKE HIM SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OF THOSE SHUFFLING
CURATES FOR INSTANCE BETTER THAN ANYBODY BONNY ROBERT
SHE SOUGHT BONNY ROBERT'S PRESENCE SPEEDILY
FOR HIS PART WHEN SHE
CHALLENGED HIS SIGHT I BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE PASSED FROM BEFORE HER
EYES LIKE A PHANTOM IF HE COULD BUT BEING A TALL FACT AND NO FICTION
HE WAS OBLIGED TO STAND THE GREETING
HE MADE IT BRIEF
IT WAS
COUSIN LIKE BROTHER LIKE FRIEND LIKE ANYTHING BUT LOVER LIKE
THE
NAMELESS CHARM OF LAST NIGHT HAD LEFT HIS MANNER HE WAS NO LONGER THE
SAME MAN OR AT ANY RATE THE SAME HEART DID NOT BEAT IN HIS BREAST
RUDE DISAPPOINTMENT SHARP CROSS AT FIRST THE EAGER GIRL WOULD NOT
BELIEVE IN THE CHANGE THOUGH SHE SAW AND FELT IT
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
WITHDRAW HER HAND FROM HIS TILL HE HAD BESTOWED AT LEAST SOMETHING LIKE
A KIND PRESSURE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TURN HER EYES FROM HIS EYES TILL
HIS LOOKS HAD EXPRESSED SOMETHING MORE AND FONDER THAN THAT COOL
WELCOME
A LOVER MASCULINE SO DISAPPOINTED CAN SPEAK AND URGE EXPLANATION A
LOVER FEMININE CAN SAY NOTHING IF SHE DID THE RESULT WOULD BE SHAME
AND ANGUISH INWARD REMORSE FOR SELF TREACHERY
NATURE WOULD BRAND SUCH
DEMONSTRATION AS A REBELLION AGAINST HER INSTINCTS AND WOULD
VINDICTIVELY REPAY IT AFTERWARDS BY THE THUNDERBOLT OF SELF CONTEMPT
SMITING SUDDENLY IN SECRET
TAKE THE MATTER AS YOU FIND IT ASK NO
QUESTIONS UTTER NO REMONSTRANCES IT IS YOUR BEST WISDOM
YOU EXPECTED
BREAD AND YOU HAVE GOT A STONE BREAK YOUR TEETH ON IT AND DON'T
SHRIEK BECAUSE THE NERVES ARE MARTYRIZED DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOUR MENTAL
STOMACH IF YOU HAVE SUCH A THING IS STRONG AS AN OSTRICH'S THE STONE
WILL DIGEST
YOU HELD OUT YOUR HAND FOR AN EGG AND FATE PUT INTO IT A
SCORPION
SHOW NO CONSTERNATION CLOSE YOUR FINGERS FIRMLY UPON THE
GIFT LET IT STING THROUGH YOUR PALM
NEVER MIND IN TIME AFTER YOUR
HAND AND ARM HAVE SWELLED AND QUIVERED LONG WITH TORTURE THE SQUEEZED
SCORPION WILL DIE AND YOU WILL HAVE LEARNED THE GREAT LESSON HOW TO
ENDURE WITHOUT A SOB
FOR THE WHOLE REMNANT OF YOUR LIFE IF YOU SURVIVE
THE TEST SOME IT IS SAID DIE UNDER IT YOU WILL BE STRONGER WISER
LESS SENSITIVE
THIS YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF PERHAPS AT THE TIME AND SO
CANNOT BORROW COURAGE OF THAT HOPE
NATURE HOWEVER AS HAS BEEN
INTIMATED IS AN EXCELLENT FRIEND IN SUCH CASES SEALING THE LIPS
INTERDICTING UTTERANCE COMMANDING A PLACID DISSIMULATION A
DISSIMULATION OFTEN WEARING AN EASY AND GAY MIEN AT FIRST SETTLING DOWN
TO SORROW AND PALENESS IN TIME THEN PASSING AWAY AND LEAVING A
CONVENIENT STOICISM NOT THE LESS FORTIFYING BECAUSE IT IS HALF BITTER
HALF BITTER IS THAT WRONG NO IT SHOULD BE BITTER BITTERNESS IS
STRENGTH IT IS A TONIC
SWEET MILD FORCE FOLLOWING ACUTE SUFFERING YOU
FIND NOWHERE TO TALK OF IT IS DELUSION
THERE MAY BE APATHETIC
EXHAUSTION AFTER THE RACK
IF ENERGY REMAINS IT WILL BE RATHER A
DANGEROUS ENERGY DEADLY WHEN CONFRONTED WITH INJUSTICE
WHO HAS READ THE BALLAD OF PUIR MARY LEE THAT OLD SCOTCH BALLAD
WRITTEN I KNOW NOT IN WHAT GENERATION NOR BY WHAT HAND MARY HAD BEEN
ILL USED PROBABLY IN BEING MADE TO BELIEVE THAT TRUTH WHICH WAS
FALSEHOOD
SHE IS NOT COMPLAINING BUT SHE IS SITTING ALONE IN THE
SNOWSTORM AND YOU HEAR HER THOUGHTS
THEY ARE NOT THE THOUGHTS OF A
MODEL HEROINE UNDER HER CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY ARE THOSE OF A
DEEPLY FEELING STRONGLY RESENTFUL PEASANT GIRL
ANGUISH HAS DRIVEN HER
FROM THE INGLE NOOK OF HOME TO THE WHITE SHROUDED AND ICY HILLS
CROUCHED UNDER THE CAULD DRIFT SHE RECALLS EVERY IMAGE OF
HORROR THE YELLOW WYMED ASK THE HAIRY ADDER THE AULD MOON BOWING
TYKE THE GHAIST AT E'EN THE SOUR BULLISTER THE MILK ON THE
TAED'S BACK SHE HATES THESE BUT WAUR SHE HATES ROBIN A REE
OH ANCE I LIVED HAPPILY BY YON BONNY BURN
THE WARLD WAS IN LOVE WI' ME
BUT NOW I MAUN SIT 'NEATH THE CAULD DRIFT AND MOURN
AND CURSE BLACK ROBIN A REE
THEN WHUDDER AWA THOU BITTER BITING BLAST
AND SOUGH THROUGH THE SCRUNTY TREE
AND SMOOR ME UP IN THE SNAW FU' FAST
AND N'ER LET THE SUN ME SEE
OH NEVER MELT AWA THOU WREATH O' SNAW
THAT'S SAE KIND IN GRAVING ME
BUT HIDE ME FRAE THE SCORN AND GUFFAW
O' VILLAINS LIKE ROBIN A REE
BUT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN THE LAST PAGE OR TWO IS NOT GERMANE TO
CAROLINE HELSTONE'S FEELINGS OR TO THE STATE OF THINGS BETWEEN HER AND
ROBERT MOORE
ROBERT HAD DONE HER NO WRONG HE HAD TOLD HER NO LIE IT
WAS SHE THAT WAS TO BLAME IF ANY ONE WAS
WHAT BITTERNESS HER MIND
DISTILLED SHOULD AND WOULD BE POURED ON HER OWN HEAD
SHE HAD LOVED
WITHOUT BEING ASKED TO LOVE A NATURAL SOMETIMES AN INEVITABLE CHANCE
BUT BIG WITH MISERY
ROBERT INDEED HAD SOMETIMES SEEMED TO BE FOND OF HER BUT WHY BECAUSE
SHE HAD MADE HERSELF SO PLEASING TO HIM HE COULD NOT IN SPITE OF ALL
HIS EFFORTS HELP TESTIFYING A STATE OF FEELING HIS JUDGMENT DID NOT
APPROVE NOR HIS WILL SANCTION
HE WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW DECIDEDLY FROM
INTIMATE COMMUNICATION WITH HER BECAUSE HE DID NOT CHOOSE TO HAVE HIS
AFFECTIONS INEXTRICABLY ENTANGLED NOR TO BE DRAWN DESPITE HIS REASON
INTO A MARRIAGE HE BELIEVED IMPRUDENT
NOW WHAT WAS SHE TO DO TO GIVE
WAY TO HER FEELINGS OR TO VANQUISH THEM TO PURSUE HIM OR TO TURN
UPON HERSELF IF SHE IS WEAK SHE WILL TRY THE FIRST EXPEDIENT WILL
LOSE HIS ESTEEM AND WIN HIS AVERSION IF SHE HAS SENSE SHE WILL BE HER
OWN GOVERNOR AND RESOLVE TO SUBDUE AND BRING UNDER GUIDANCE THE
DISTURBED REALM OF HER EMOTIONS
SHE WILL DETERMINE TO LOOK ON LIFE
STEADILY AS IT IS TO BEGIN TO LEARN ITS SEVERE TRUTHS SERIOUSLY AND
TO STUDY ITS KNOTTY PROBLEMS CLOSELY CONSCIENTIOUSLY
IT APPEARED SHE HAD A LITTLE SENSE FOR SHE QUITTED ROBERT QUIETLY
WITHOUT COMPLAINT OR QUESTION WITHOUT THE ALTERATION OF A MUSCLE OR THE
SHEDDING OF A TEAR BETOOK HERSELF TO HER STUDIES UNDER HORTENSE AS
USUAL AND AT DINNER TIME WENT HOME WITHOUT LINGERING
WHEN SHE HAD DINED AND FOUND HERSELF IN THE RECTORY DRAWING ROOM ALONE
HAVING LEFT HER UNCLE OVER HIS TEMPERATE GLASS OF PORT WINE THE
DIFFICULTY THAT OCCURRED TO AND EMBARRASSED HER WAS HOW AM I TO GET
THROUGH THIS DAY
LAST NIGHT SHE HAD HOPED IT WOULD BE SPENT AS YESTERDAY WAS THAT THE
EVENING WOULD BE AGAIN PASSED WITH HAPPINESS AND ROBERT
SHE HAD LEARNED
HER MISTAKE THIS MORNING AND YET SHE COULD NOT SETTLE DOWN CONVINCED
THAT NO CHANCE WOULD OCCUR TO RECALL HER TO HOLLOW'S COTTAGE OR TO
BRING MOORE AGAIN INTO HER SOCIETY
HE HAD WALKED UP AFTER TEA MORE THAN ONCE TO PASS AN HOUR WITH HER
UNCLE
THE DOOR BELL HAD RUNG HIS VOICE HAD BEEN HEARD IN THE PASSAGE
JUST AT TWILIGHT WHEN SHE LITTLE EXPECTED SUCH A PLEASURE AND THIS HAD
HAPPENED TWICE AFTER HE HAD TREATED HER WITH PECULIAR RESERVE AND
THOUGH HE RARELY TALKED TO HER IN HER UNCLE'S PRESENCE HE HAD LOOKED AT
HER RELENTINGLY AS HE SAT OPPOSITE HER WORK TABLE DURING HIS STAY
THE
FEW WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER WERE COMFORTING HIS MANNER ON BIDDING
HER GOOD NIGHT WAS GENIAL
NOW HE MIGHT COME THIS EVENING SAID FALSE
HOPE
SHE ALMOST KNEW IT WAS FALSE HOPE WHICH BREATHED THE WHISPER AND
YET SHE LISTENED
SHE TRIED TO READ HER THOUGHTS WANDERED SHE TRIED TO SEW EVERY STITCH
SHE PUT IN WAS AN ENNUI THE OCCUPATION WAS INSUFFERABLY TEDIOUS SHE
OPENED HER DESK AND ATTEMPTED TO WRITE A FRENCH COMPOSITION SHE WROTE
NOTHING BUT MISTAKES
SUDDENLY THE DOOR BELL SHARPLY RANG HER HEART LEAPED SHE SPRANG TO THE
DRAWING ROOM DOOR OPENED IT SOFTLY PEEPED THROUGH THE APERTURE
FANNY
WAS ADMITTING A VISITOR A GENTLEMAN A TALL MAN JUST THE HEIGHT OF
ROBERT
FOR ONE SECOND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS ROBERT FOR ONE SECOND SHE
EXULTED BUT THE VOICE ASKING FOR MR
HELSTONE UNDECEIVED HER
THAT
VOICE WAS AN IRISH VOICE CONSEQUENTLY NOT MOORE'S BUT THE
CURATE'S MALONE'S
HE WAS USHERED INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE
DOUBTLESS HE SPEEDILY HELPED HIS RECTOR TO EMPTY THE DECANTERS
IT WAS A FACT TO BE NOTED THAT AT WHATEVER HOUSE IN BRIARFIELD
WHINBURY OR NUNNELY ONE CURATE DROPPED IN TO A MEAL DINNER OR TEA AS
THE CASE MIGHT BE ANOTHER PRESENTLY FOLLOWED OFTEN TWO MORE
NOT THAT
THEY GAVE EACH OTHER THE RENDEZVOUS BUT THEY WERE USUALLY ALL ON THE
RUN AT THE SAME TIME AND WHEN DONNE FOR INSTANCE SOUGHT MALONE AT HIS
LODGINGS AND FOUND HIM NOT HE INQUIRED WHITHER HE HAD POSTED AND
HAVING LEARNED OF THE LANDLADY HIS DESTINATION HASTENED WITH ALL SPEED
AFTER HIM
THE SAME CAUSES OPERATED IN THE SAME WAY WITH SWEETING
THUS
IT CHANCED ON THAT AFTERNOON THAT CAROLINE'S EARS WERE THREE TIMES
TORTURED WITH THE RINGING OF THE BELL AND THE ADVENT OF UNDESIRED
GUESTS FOR DONNE FOLLOWED MALONE AND SWEETING FOLLOWED DONNE AND MORE
WINE WAS ORDERED UP FROM THE CELLAR INTO THE DINING ROOM FOR THOUGH OLD
HELSTONE CHID THE INFERIOR PRIESTHOOD WHEN HE FOUND THEM CAROUSING AS
HE CALLED IT IN THEIR OWN TENTS YET AT HIS HIERARCHICAL TABLE HE EVER
LIKED TO TREAT THEM TO A GLASS OF HIS BEST AND THROUGH THE CLOSED
DOORS CAROLINE HEARD THEIR BOYISH LAUGHTER AND THE VACANT CACKLE OF
THEIR VOICES
HER FEAR WAS LEST THEY SHOULD STAY TO TEA FOR SHE HAD NO
PLEASURE IN MAKING TEA FOR THAT PARTICULAR TRIO
WHAT DISTINCTIONS
PEOPLE DRAW THESE THREE WERE MEN YOUNG MEN EDUCATED MEN LIKE MOORE
YET FOR HER HOW GREAT THE DIFFERENCE THEIR SOCIETY WAS A BORE HIS A
DELIGHT
NOT ONLY WAS SHE DESTINED TO BE FAVOURED WITH THEIR CLERICAL COMPANY
BUT FORTUNE WAS AT THIS MOMENT BRINGING HER FOUR OTHER GUESTS LADY
GUESTS ALL PACKED IN A PONY PHAETON NOW ROLLING SOMEWHAT HEAVILY ALONG
THE ROAD FROM WHINBURY AN ELDERLY LADY AND THREE OF HER BUXOM DAUGHTERS
WERE COMING TO SEE HER IN A FRIENDLY WAY AS THE CUSTOM OF THAT
NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS
YES A FOURTH TIME THE BELL CLANGED
FANNY BROUGHT
THE PRESENT ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE DRAWING ROOM
MRS
SYKES AND THE THREE MISSES SYKES
WHEN CAROLINE WAS GOING TO RECEIVE COMPANY HER HABIT WAS TO WRING HER
HANDS VERY NERVOUSLY TO FLUSH A LITTLE AND COME FORWARD HURRIEDLY YET
HESITATINGLY WISHING HERSELF MEANTIME AT JERICHO
SHE WAS AT SUCH
CRISES SADLY DEFICIENT IN FINISHED MANNER THOUGH SHE HAD ONCE BEEN AT
SCHOOL A YEAR
ACCORDINGLY ON THIS OCCASION HER SMALL WHITE HANDS
SADLY MALTREATED EACH OTHER WHILE SHE STOOD UP WAITING THE ENTRANCE OF
MRS
SYKES
IN STALKED THAT LADY A TALL BILIOUS GENTLEWOMAN WHO MADE AN AMPLE AND
NOT ALTOGETHER INSINCERE PROFESSION OF PIETY AND WAS GREATLY GIVEN TO
HOSPITALITY TOWARDS THE CLERGY
IN SAILED HER THREE DAUGHTERS A SHOWY
TRIO BEING ALL THREE WELL GROWN AND MORE OR LESS HANDSOME
IN ENGLISH COUNTRY LADIES THERE IS THIS POINT TO BE REMARKED
WHETHER
YOUNG OR OLD PRETTY OR PLAIN DULL OR SPRIGHTLY THEY ALL OR ALMOST
ALL HAVE A CERTAIN EXPRESSION STAMPED ON THEIR FEATURES WHICH SEEMS TO
SAY I KNOW I DO NOT BOAST OF IT BUT I KNOW THAT I AM THE STANDARD
OF WHAT IS PROPER LET EVERY ONE THEREFORE WHOM I APPROACH OR WHO
APPROACHES ME KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT FOR WHEREIN THEY DIFFER FROM ME BE
THE SAME IN DRESS MANNER OPINION PRINCIPLE OR PRACTICE THEREIN THEY
ARE WRONG
MRS
AND MISSES SYKES FAR FROM BEING EXCEPTIONS TO THIS OBSERVATION
WERE POINTED ILLUSTRATIONS OF ITS TRUTH
MISS MARY A WELL LOOKED
WELL MEANT AND ON THE WHOLE WELL DISPOSITIONED GIRL WORE HER
COMPLACENCY WITH SOME STATE THOUGH WITHOUT HARSHNESS
MISS HARRIET A
BEAUTY CARRIED IT MORE OVERBEARINGLY SHE LOOKED HIGH AND COLD
MISS
HANNAH WHO WAS CONCEITED DASHING PUSHING FLOURISHED HERS CONSCIOUSLY
AND OPENLY
THE MOTHER EVINCED IT WITH THE GRAVITY PROPER TO HER AGE AND
RELIGIOUS FAME
THE RECEPTION WAS GOT THROUGH SOMEHOW
CAROLINE WAS GLAD TO SEE THEM
AN UNMITIGATED FIB HOPED THEY WERE WELL HOPED MRS
SYKES'S COUGH WAS
BETTER MRS
SYKES HAD HAD A COUGH FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HOPED THE
MISSES SYKES HAD LEFT THEIR SISTERS AT HOME WELL TO WHICH INQUIRY THE
MISSES SYKES SITTING ON THREE CHAIRS OPPOSITE THE MUSIC STOOL WHEREON
CAROLINE HAD UNDESIGNEDLY COME TO ANCHOR AFTER WAVERING FOR SOME
SECONDS BETWEEN IT AND A LARGE ARM CHAIR INTO WHICH SHE AT LENGTH
RECOLLECTED SHE OUGHT TO INDUCT MRS
SYKES AND INDEED THAT LADY SAVED
HER THE TROUBLE BY DEPOSITING HERSELF THEREIN THE MISSES SYKES REPLIED
TO CAROLINE BY ONE SIMULTANEOUS BOW VERY MAJESTIC AND MIGHTY AWFUL
A
PAUSE FOLLOWED
THIS BOW WAS OF A CHARACTER TO ENSURE SILENCE FOR THE
NEXT FIVE MINUTES AND IT DID
MRS
SYKES THEN INQUIRED AFTER MR
HELSTONE AND WHETHER HE HAD HAD ANY RETURN OF RHEUMATISM AND WHETHER
PREACHING TWICE ON A SUNDAY FATIGUED HIM AND IF HE WAS CAPABLE OF
TAKING A FULL SERVICE NOW AND ON BEING ASSURED HE WAS SHE AND ALL HER
DAUGHTERS COMBINING IN CHORUS EXPRESSED THEIR OPINION THAT HE WAS A
WONDERFUL MAN OF HIS YEARS
PAUSE SECOND
MISS MARY GETTING UP THE STEAM IN HER TURN ASKED WHETHER CAROLINE HAD
ATTENDED THE BIBLE SOCIETY MEETING WHICH HAD BEEN HELD AT NUNNELY LAST
THURSDAY NIGHT
THE NEGATIVE ANSWER WHICH TRUTH COMPELLED CAROLINE TO
UTTER FOR LAST THURSDAY EVENING SHE HAD BEEN SITTING AT HOME READING A
NOVEL WHICH ROBERT HAD LENT HER ELICITED A SIMULTANEOUS EXPRESSION OF
SURPRISE FROM THE LIPS OF THE FOUR LADIES
WE WERE ALL THERE SAID MISS MARY MAMMA AND ALL OF US
WE EVEN
PERSUADED PAPA TO GO
HANNAH WOULD INSIST UPON IT
BUT HE FELL ASLEEP
WHILE MR
LANGWEILIG THE GERMAN MORAVIAN MINISTER WAS SPEAKING
I FELT
QUITE ASHAMED HE NODDED SO
AND THERE WAS DR
BROADBENT CRIED HANNAH SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SPEAKER
YOU COULDN'T EXPECT IT OF HIM FOR HE IS ALMOST A VULGAR LOOKING MAN
BUT SUCH A DEAR MAN INTERRUPTED MARY
AND SUCH A GOOD MAN SUCH A USEFUL MAN ADDED HER MOTHER
ONLY LIKE A BUTCHER IN APPEARANCE INTERPOSED THE FAIR PROUD HARRIET
I COULDN'T BEAR TO LOOK AT HIM
I LISTENED WITH MY EYES SHUT
MISS HELSTONE FELT HER IGNORANCE AND INCOMPETENCY
NOT HAVING SEEN DR
BROADBENT SHE COULD NOT GIVE HER OPINION
PAUSE THIRD CAME ON
DURING
ITS CONTINUANCE CAROLINE WAS FEELING AT HER HEART'S CORE WHAT A
DREAMING FOOL SHE WAS WHAT AN UNPRACTICAL LIFE SHE LED HOW LITTLE
FITNESS THERE WAS IN HER FOR ORDINARY INTERCOURSE WITH THE ORDINARY
WORLD
SHE WAS FEELING HOW EXCLUSIVELY SHE HAD ATTACHED HERSELF TO THE
WHITE COTTAGE IN THE HOLLOW HOW IN THE EXISTENCE OF ONE INMATE OF THAT
COTTAGE SHE HAD PENT ALL HER UNIVERSE
SHE WAS SENSIBLE THAT THIS WOULD
NOT DO AND THAT SOME DAY SHE WOULD BE FORCED TO MAKE AN ALTERATION
IT
COULD NOT BE SAID THAT SHE EXACTLY WISHED TO RESEMBLE THE LADIES BEFORE
HER BUT SHE WISHED TO BECOME SUPERIOR TO HER PRESENT SELF SO AS TO
FEEL LESS SCARED BY THEIR DIGNITY
THE SOLE MEANS SHE FOUND OF REVIVING THE FLAGGING DISCOURSE WAS BY
ASKING THEM IF THEY WOULD ALL STAY TO TEA AND A CRUEL STRUGGLE IT COST
HER TO PERFORM THIS PIECE OF CIVILITY
MRS
SYKES HAD BEGUN WE ARE
MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU BUT WHEN IN CAME FANNY ONCE MORE
THE GENTLEMEN WILL STAY THE EVENING MA'AM WAS THE MESSAGE SHE
BROUGHT FROM MR
HELSTONE
WHAT GENTLEMEN HAVE YOU NOW INQUIRED MRS
SYKES
THEIR NAMES WERE
SPECIFIED SHE AND HER DAUGHTERS INTERCHANGED GLANCES
THE CURATES WERE
NOT TO THEM WHAT THEY WERE TO CAROLINE
MR
SWEETING WAS QUITE A
FAVOURITE WITH THEM EVEN MR
MALONE RATHER SO BECAUSE HE WAS A
CLERGYMAN
REALLY SINCE YOU HAVE COMPANY ALREADY I THINK WE WILL
STAY REMARKED MRS
SYKES
WE SHALL BE QUITE A PLEASANT LITTLE PARTY
I ALWAYS LIKE TO MEET THE CLERGY
AND NOW CAROLINE HAD TO USHER THEM UPSTAIRS TO HELP THEM TO UNSHAWL
SMOOTH THEIR HAIR AND MAKE THEMSELVES SMART TO RECONDUCT THEM TO THE
DRAWING ROOM TO DISTRIBUTE AMONGST THEM BOOKS OF ENGRAVINGS OR ODD
THINGS PURCHASED FROM THE JEW BASKET
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO BE A PURCHASER
THOUGH SHE WAS BUT A SLACK CONTRIBUTOR AND IF SHE HAD POSSESSED PLENTY
OF MONEY SHE WOULD RATHER WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE RECTORY AN AWFUL
INCUBUS HAVE PURCHASED THE WHOLE STOCK THAN CONTRIBUTED A SINGLE
PIN CUSHION
IT OUGHT PERHAPS TO BE EXPLAINED IN PASSING FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE
WHO ARE NOT AU FAIT TO THE MYSTERIES OF THE JEW BASKET AND
MISSIONARY BASKET THAT THESE MEUBLES ARE WILLOW REPOSITORIES OF
THE CAPACITY OF A GOOD SIZED FAMILY CLOTHES BASKET DEDICATED TO THE
PURPOSE OF CONVEYING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE A MONSTER COLLECTION OF
PIN CUSHIONS NEEDLE BOOKS CARD RACKS WORKBAGS ARTICLES OF INFANT
WEAR ETC ETC ETC MADE BY THE WILLING OR RELUCTANT HANDS OF THE
CHRISTIAN LADIES OF A PARISH AND SOLD PERFORCE TO THE HEATHENISH
GENTLEMEN THEREOF AT PRICES UNBLUSHINGLY EXORBITANT
THE PROCEEDS OF
SUCH COMPULSORY SALES ARE APPLIED TO THE CONVERSION OF THE JEWS THE
SEEKING UP OF THE TEN MISSING TRIBES OR TO THE REGENERATION OF THE
INTERESTING COLOURED POPULATION OF THE GLOBE
EACH LADY CONTRIBUTOR
TAKES IT IN HER TURN TO KEEP THE BASKET A MONTH TO SEW FOR IT AND TO
FOIST OFF ITS CONTENTS ON A SHRINKING MALE PUBLIC
AN EXCITING TIME IT
IS WHEN THAT TURN COMES ROUND
SOME ACTIVE MINDED WOMAN WITH A GOOD
TRADING SPIRIT LIKE IT AND ENJOY EXCEEDINGLY THE FUN OF MAKING
HARD HANDED WORSTED SPINNERS CASH UP TO THE TUNE OF FOUR OR FIVE
HUNDRED PER CENT
ABOVE COST PRICE FOR ARTICLES QUITE USELESS TO THEM
OTHER FEEBLER SOULS OBJECT TO IT AND WOULD RATHER SEE THE PRINCE OF
DARKNESS HIMSELF AT THEIR DOOR ANY MORNING THAN THAT PHANTOM BASKET
BROUGHT WITH MRS
ROUSE'S COMPLIMENTS AND PLEASE MA'AM SHE SAYS IT'S
YOUR TURN NOW
MISS HELSTONE'S DUTIES OF HOSTESS PERFORMED MORE ANXIOUSLY THAN
CHEERILY SHE BETOOK HERSELF TO THE KITCHEN TO HOLD A BRIEF
PRIVY COUNCIL WITH FANNY AND ELIZA ABOUT THE TEA
WHAT A LOT ON 'EM CRIED ELIZA WHO WAS COOK
AND I PUT OFF THE
BAKING TO DAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE BREAD PLENTY TO FIT WHILE
MORNING
WE SHALL NEVER HAVE ENOW
ARE THERE ANY TEA CAKES ASKED THE YOUNG MISTRESS
ONLY THREE AND A LOAF
I WISH THESE FINE FOLK WOULD STAY AT HOME TILL
THEY'RE ASKED AND I WANT TO FINISH TRIMMING MY HAT BONNET SHE MEANT
THEN SUGGESTED CAROLINE TO WHOM THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EMERGENCY GAVE
A CERTAIN ENERGY FANNY MUST RUN DOWN TO BRIARFIELD AND BUY SOME
MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS AND SOME BISCUITS
AND DON'T BE CROSS ELIZA WE
CAN'T HELP IT NOW
AND WHICH TEA THINGS ARE WE TO HAVE
OH THE BEST I SUPPOSE
I'LL GET OUT THE SILVER SERVICE AND SHE RAN
UPSTAIRS TO THE PLATE CLOSET AND PRESENTLY BROUGHT DOWN TEAPOT
CREAM EWER AND SUGAR BASIN
AND MUN WE HAVE TH' URN
YES AND NOW GET IT READY AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN FOR THE SOONER WE HAVE
TEA OVER THE SOONER THEY WILL GO AT LEAST I HOPE SO
HEIGH HO I WISH
THEY WERE GONE SHE SIGHED AS SHE RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM
STILL SHE THOUGHT AS SHE PAUSED AT THE DOOR ERE OPENING IT IF
ROBERT WOULD BUT COME EVEN NOW HOW BRIGHT ALL WOULD BE HOW
COMPARATIVELY EASY THE TASK OF AMUSING THESE PEOPLE IF HE WERE PRESENT
THERE WOULD BE AN INTEREST IN HEARING HIM TALK THOUGH HE NEVER SAYS
MUCH IN COMPANY AND IN TALKING IN HIS PRESENCE
THERE CAN BE NO
INTEREST IN HEARING ANY OF THEM OR IN SPEAKING TO THEM
HOW THEY WILL
GABBLE WHEN THE CURATES COME IN AND HOW WEARY I SHALL GROW WITH
LISTENING TO THEM BUT I SUPPOSE I AM A SELFISH FOOL
THESE ARE VERY
RESPECTABLE GENTLEFOLKS
I OUGHT NO DOUBT TO BE PROUD OF THEIR
COUNTENANCE
I DON'T SAY THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD AS I AM FAR FROM IT BUT
THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM ME
SHE WENT IN
YORKSHIRE PEOPLE IN THOSE DAYS TOOK THEIR TEA ROUND THE TABLE SITTING
WELL INTO IT WITH THEIR KNEES DULY INTRODUCED UNDER THE MAHOGANY
IT
WAS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE A MULTITUDE OF PLATES OF BREAD AND BUTTER VARIED
IN SORTS AND PLENTIFUL IN QUANTITY
IT WAS THOUGHT PROPER TOO THAT ON
THE CENTRE PLATE SHOULD STAND A GLASS DISH OF MARMALADE
AMONG THE
VIANDS WAS EXPECTED TO BE FOUND A SMALL ASSORTMENT OF CHEESECAKES AND
TARTS
IF THERE WAS ALSO A PLATE OF THIN SLICES OF PINK HAM GARNISHED
WITH GREEN PARSLEY SO MUCH THE BETTER
ELIZA THE RECTOR'S COOK FORTUNATELY KNEW HER BUSINESS AS PROVIDER
SHE
HAD BEEN PUT OUT OF HUMOUR A LITTLE AT FIRST WHEN THE INVADERS CAME SO
UNEXPECTEDLY IN SUCH STRENGTH BUT IT APPEARED THAT SHE REGAINED HER
CHEERFULNESS WITH ACTION FOR IN DUE TIME THE TEA WAS SPREAD FORTH IN
HANDSOME STYLE AND NEITHER HAM TARTS NOR MARMALADE WERE WANTING AMONG
ITS ACCOMPANIMENTS
THE CURATES SUMMONED TO THIS BOUNTEOUS REPAST ENTERED JOYOUS BUT AT
ONCE ON SEEING THE LADIES OF WHOSE PRESENCE THEY HAD NOT BEEN
FOREWARNED THEY CAME TO A STAND IN THE DOORWAY
MALONE HEADED THE
PARTY HE STOPPED SHORT AND FELL BACK ALMOST CAPSIZING DONNE WHO WAS
BEHIND HIM
DONNE STAGGERING THREE PACES IN RETREAT SENT LITTLE
SWEETING INTO THE ARMS OF OLD HELSTONE WHO BROUGHT UP THE REAR
THERE
WAS SOME EXPOSTULATION SOME TITTERING
MALONE WAS DESIRED TO MIND WHAT
HE WAS ABOUT AND URGED TO PUSH FORWARD WHICH AT LAST HE DID THOUGH
COLOURING TO THE TOP OF HIS PEAKED FOREHEAD A BLUISH PURPLE
HELSTONE
ADVANCING SET THE SHY CURATES ASIDE WELCOMED ALL HIS FAIR GUESTS
SHOOK HANDS AND PASSED A JEST WITH EACH AND SEATED HIMSELF SNUGLY
BETWEEN THE LOVELY HARRIET AND THE DASHING HANNAH
MISS MARY HE
REQUESTED TO MOVE TO THE SEAT OPPOSITE TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT SEE HER IF
HE COULDN'T BE NEAR HER
PERFECTLY EASY AND GALLANT IN HIS WAY WERE
HIS MANNERS ALWAYS TO YOUNG LADIES AND MOST POPULAR WAS HE AMONGST
THEM YET AT HEART HE NEITHER RESPECTED NOR LIKED THE SEX AND SUCH OF
THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES HAD BROUGHT INTO INTIMATE RELATION WITH HIM HAD
EVER FEARED RATHER THAN LOVED HIM
THE CURATES WERE LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES
SWEETING WHO WAS THE
LEAST EMBARRASSED OF THE THREE TOOK REFUGE BESIDE MRS
SYKES WHO HE
KNEW WAS ALMOST AS FOND OF HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN HER SON
DONNE AFTER
MAKING HIS GENERAL BOW WITH A GRACE ALL HIS OWN AND SAYING IN A HIGH
PRAGMATICAL VOICE HOW D'YE DO MISS HELSTONE DROPPED INTO A SEAT AT
CAROLINE'S ELBOW TO HER UNMITIGATED ANNOYANCE FOR SHE HAD A PECULIAR
ANTIPATHY TO DONNE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS STULTIFIED AND IMMOVABLE
SELF CONCEIT AND HIS INCURABLE NARROWNESS OF MIND
MALONE GRINNING MOST
UNMEANINGLY INDUCTED HIMSELF INTO THE CORRESPONDING SEAT ON THE OTHER
SIDE
SHE WAS THUS BLESSED IN A PAIR OF SUPPORTERS NEITHER OF WHOM SHE
KNEW WOULD BE OF ANY MORTAL USE WHETHER FOR KEEPING UP THE
CONVERSATION HANDING CUPS CIRCULATING THE MUFFINS OR EVEN LIFTING THE
PLATE FROM THE SLOP BASIN
LITTLE SWEETING SMALL AND BOYISH AS HE WAS
WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH TWENTY OF THEM
MALONE THOUGH A CEASELESS TALKER WHEN THERE WERE ONLY MEN PRESENT WAS
USUALLY TONGUE TIED IN THE PRESENCE OF LADIES
THREE PHRASES HOWEVER
HE HAD READY CUT AND DRIED WHICH HE NEVER FAILED TO PRODUCE
1STLY
HAVE YOU HAD A WALK TO DAY MISS HELSTONE
2NDLY
HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR COUSIN MOORE LATELY
3RDLY
DOES YOUR CLASS AT THE SUNDAY SCHOOL KEEP UP ITS NUMBER
THESE THREE QUESTIONS BEING PUT AND RESPONDED TO BETWEEN CAROLINE AND
MALONE REIGNED SILENCE
WITH DONNE IT WAS OTHERWISE HE WAS TROUBLESOME EXASPERATING
HE HAD A
STOCK OF SMALL TALK ON HAND AT ONCE THE MOST TRITE AND PERVERSE THAT
CAN WELL BE IMAGINED ABUSE OF THE PEOPLE OF BRIARFIELD OF THE NATIVES
OF YORKSHIRE GENERALLY COMPLAINTS OF THE WANT OF HIGH SOCIETY OF THE
BACKWARD STATE OF CIVILIZATION IN THESE DISTRICTS MURMURINGS AGAINST
THE DISRESPECTFUL CONDUCT OF THE LOWER ORDERS IN THE NORTH TOWARD THEIR
BETTERS SILLY RIDICULE OF THE MANNER OF LIVING IN THESE PARTS THE WANT
OF STYLE THE ABSENCE OF ELEGANCE AS IF HE DONNE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED
TO VERY GREAT DOINGS INDEED AN INSINUATION WHICH HIS SOMEWHAT UNDERBRED
MANNER AND ASPECT FAILED TO BEAR OUT
THESE STRICTURES HE SEEMED TO
THINK MUST RAISE HIM IN THE ESTIMATION OF MISS HELSTONE OR OF ANY OTHER
LADY WHO HEARD HIM WHEREAS WITH HER AT LEAST THEY BROUGHT HIM TO A
LEVEL BELOW CONTEMPT THOUGH SOMETIMES INDEED THEY INCENSED HER FOR
A YORKSHIRE GIRL HERSELF SHE HATED TO HEAR YORKSHIRE ABUSED BY SUCH A
PITIFUL PRATER AND WHEN WROUGHT UP TO A CERTAIN PITCH SHE WOULD TURN
AND SAY SOMETHING OF WHICH NEITHER THE MATTER NOR THE MANNER RECOMMENDED
HER TO MR
DONNE'S GOOD WILL
SHE WOULD TELL HIM IT WAS NO PROOF OF
REFINEMENT TO BE EVER SCOLDING OTHERS FOR VULGARITY AND NO SIGN OF A
GOOD PASTOR TO BE ETERNALLY CENSURING HIS FLOCK
SHE WOULD ASK HIM WHAT
HE HAD ENTERED THE CHURCH FOR SINCE HE COMPLAINED THERE WERE ONLY
COTTAGES TO VISIT AND POOR PEOPLE TO PREACH TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN
ORDAINED TO THE MINISTRY MERELY TO WEAR SOFT CLOTHING AND SIT IN KING'S
HOUSES
THESE QUESTIONS WERE CONSIDERED BY ALL THE CURATES AS TO THE
LAST DEGREE AUDACIOUS AND IMPIOUS
TEA WAS A LONG TIME IN PROGRESS ALL THE GUESTS GABBLED AS THEIR HOSTESS
HAD EXPECTED THEY WOULD
MR
HELSTONE BEING IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS WHEN
INDEED WAS HE EVER OTHERWISE IN SOCIETY ATTRACTIVE FEMALE SOCIETY IT
BEING ONLY WITH THE ONE LADY OF HIS OWN FAMILY THAT HE MAINTAINED A GRIM
TACITURNITY KEPT UP A BRILLIANT FLOW OF EASY PRATTLE WITH HIS
RIGHT HAND AND LEFT HAND NEIGHBOURS AND EVEN WITH HIS VIS VIS MISS
MARY THOUGH AS MARY WAS THE MOST SENSIBLE THE LEAST COQUETTISH OF
THE THREE TO HER THE ELDERLY WIDOWER WAS THE LEAST ATTENTIVE
AT HEART
HE COULD NOT ABIDE SENSE IN WOMEN
HE LIKED TO SEE THEM AS SILLY AS
LIGHT HEADED AS VAIN AS OPEN TO RIDICULE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY
WERE THEN IN REALITY WHAT HE HELD THEM TO BE AND WISHED THEM TO
BE INFERIOR TOYS TO PLAY WITH TO AMUSE A VACANT HOUR AND TO BE
THROWN AWAY
HANNAH WAS HIS FAVOURITE
HARRIET THOUGH BEAUTIFUL EGOTISTICAL AND
SELF SATISFIED WAS NOT QUITE WEAK ENOUGH FOR HIM
SHE HAD SOME GENUINE
SELF RESPECT AMIDST MUCH FALSE PRIDE AND IF SHE DID NOT TALK LIKE AN
ORACLE NEITHER WOULD SHE BABBLE LIKE ONE CRAZY SHE WOULD NOT PERMIT
HERSELF TO BE TREATED QUITE AS A DOLL A CHILD A PLAYTHING SHE
EXPECTED TO BE BENT TO LIKE A QUEEN
HANNAH ON THE CONTRARY DEMANDED NO RESPECT ONLY FLATTERY
IF HER
ADMIRERS ONLY TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS AN ANGEL SHE WOULD LET THEM
TREAT HER LIKE AN IDIOT
SO VERY CREDULOUS AND FRIVOLOUS WAS SHE SO
VERY SILLY DID SHE BECOME WHEN BESIEGED WITH ATTENTION FLATTERED AND
ADMIRED TO THE PROPER DEGREE THAT THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HELSTONE
ACTUALLY FELT TEMPTED TO COMMIT MATRIMONY A SECOND TIME AND TO TRY THE
EXPERIMENT OF TAKING HER FOR HIS SECOND HELPMEET BUT FORTUNATELY THE
SALUTARY RECOLLECTION OF THE ENNUIS OF HIS FIRST MARRIAGE THE
IMPRESSION STILL LEFT ON HIM OF THE WEIGHT OF THE MILLSTONE HE HAD ONCE
WORN ROUND HIS NECK THE FIXITY OF HIS FEELINGS RESPECTING THE
INSUFFERABLE EVILS OF CONJUGAL EXISTENCE OPERATED AS A CHECK TO HIS
TENDERNESS SUPPRESSED THE SIGH HEAVING HIS OLD IRON LUNGS AND
RESTRAINED HIM FROM WHISPERING TO HANNAH PROPOSALS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
HIGH FUN AND GREAT SATISFACTION TO HER TO HEAR
IT IS PROBABLE SHE WOULD HAVE MARRIED HIM IF HE HAD ASKED HER HER
PARENTS WOULD HAVE QUITE APPROVED THE MATCH
TO THEM HIS FIFTY FIVE
YEARS HIS BEND LEATHER HEART COULD HAVE PRESENTED NO OBSTACLES AND AS
HE WAS A RECTOR HELD AN EXCELLENT LIVING OCCUPIED A GOOD HOUSE AND
WAS SUPPOSED EVEN TO HAVE PRIVATE PROPERTY THOUGH IN THAT THE WORLD WAS
MISTAKEN EVERY PENNY OF THE 5 000 INHERITED BY HIM FROM HIS FATHER HAD
BEEN DEVOTED TO THE BUILDING AND ENDOWING OF A NEW CHURCH AT HIS NATIVE
VILLAGE IN LANCASHIRE FOR HE COULD SHOW A LORDLY MUNIFICENCE WHEN HE
PLEASED AND IF THE END WAS TO HIS LIKING NEVER HESITATED ABOUT MAKING
A GRAND SACRIFICE TO ATTAIN IT HER PARENTS I SAY WOULD HAVE
DELIVERED HANNAH OVER TO HIS LOVINGKINDNESS AND HIS TENDER MERCIES
WITHOUT ONE SCRUPLE AND THE SECOND MRS
HELSTONE INVERTING THE NATURAL
ORDER OF INSECT EXISTENCE WOULD HAVE FLUTTERED THROUGH THE HONEYMOON A
BRIGHT ADMIRED BUTTERFLY AND CRAWLED THE REST OF HER DAYS A SORDID
TRAMPLED WORM
LITTLE MR
SWEETING SEATED BETWEEN MRS
SYKES AND MISS MARY BOTH OF
WHOM WERE VERY KIND TO HIM AND HAVING A DISH OF TARTS BEFORE HIM AND
MARMALADE AND CRUMPET UPON HIS PLATE LOOKED AND FELT MORE CONTENT THAN
ANY MONARCH
HE WAS FOND OF ALL THE MISSES SYKES THEY WERE ALL FOND OF
HIM
HE THOUGHT THEM MAGNIFICENT GIRLS QUITE PROPER TO MATE WITH ONE OF
HIS INCHES
IF HE HAD A CAUSE OF REGRET AT THIS BLISSFUL MOMENT IT WAS
THAT MISS DORA HAPPENED TO BE ABSENT DORA BEING THE ONE WHOM HE
SECRETLY HOPED ONE DAY TO CALL MRS
DAVID SWEETING WITH WHOM HE DREAMT
OF TAKING STATELY WALKS LEADING HER LIKE AN EMPRESS THROUGH THE VILLAGE
OF NUNNELY AND AN EMPRESS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF SIZE COULD MAKE AN
EMPRESS
SHE WAS VAST PONDEROUS
SEEN FROM BEHIND SHE HAD THE AIR OF A
VERY STOUT LADY OF FORTY BUT WITHAL SHE POSSESSED A GOOD FACE AND NO
UNKINDLY CHARACTER
THE MEAL AT LAST DREW TO A CLOSE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER LONG AGO IF
MR
DONNE HAD NOT PERSISTED IN SITTING WITH HIS CUP HALF FULL OF COLD
TEA BEFORE HIM LONG AFTER THE REST HAD FINISHED AND AFTER HE HIMSELF
HAD DISCUSSED SUCH ALLOWANCE OF VIANDS AS HE FELT COMPETENT TO
SWALLOW LONG INDEED AFTER SIGNS OF IMPATIENCE HAD BEEN MANIFESTED
ALL ROUND THE BOARD TILL CHAIRS WERE PUSHED BACK TILL THE TALK
FLAGGED TILL SILENCE FELL
VAINLY DID CAROLINE INQUIRE REPEATEDLY IF HE
WOULD HAVE ANOTHER CUP IF HE WOULD TAKE A LITTLE HOT TEA AS THAT MUST
BE COLD ETC HE WOULD NEITHER DRINK IT NOR LEAVE IT
HE SEEMED TO
THINK THAT THIS ISOLATED POSITION OF HIS GAVE HIM SOMEHOW A CERTAIN
IMPORTANCE THAT IT WAS DIGNIFIED AND STATELY TO BE THE LAST THAT IT
WAS GRAND TO KEEP ALL THE OTHERS WAITING
SO LONG DID HE LINGER THAT
THE VERY URN DIED IT CEASED TO HISS
AT LENGTH HOWEVER THE OLD RECTOR
HIMSELF WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN TOO PLEASANTLY ENGAGED WITH HANNAH TO
CARE FOR THE DELAY GOT IMPATIENT
FOR WHOM ARE WE WAITING HE ASKED
FOR ME I BELIEVE RETURNED DONNE COMPLACENTLY APPEARING TO THINK IT
MUCH TO HIS CREDIT THAT A PARTY SHOULD THUS BE KEPT DEPENDENT ON HIS
MOVEMENTS
TUT CRIED HELSTONE
THEN STANDING UP LET US RETURN THANKS SAID
HE WHICH HE DID FORTHWITH AND ALL QUITTED THE TABLE
DONNE NOTHING
ABASHED STILL SAT TEN MINUTES QUITE ALONE WHEREUPON MR
HELSTONE RANG
THE BELL FOR THE THINGS TO BE REMOVED
THE CURATE AT LENGTH SAW HIMSELF
FORCED TO EMPTY HIS CUP AND TO RELINQUISH THE RLE WHICH HE THOUGHT
HAD GIVEN HIM SUCH A FELICITOUS DISTINCTION DRAWING UPON HIM SUCH
FLATTERING GENERAL NOTICE
AND NOW IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF EVENTS CAROLINE KNOWING HOW IT WOULD
BE HAD OPENED THE PIANO AND PRODUCED MUSIC BOOKS IN READINESS MUSIC
WAS ASKED FOR
THIS WAS MR
SWEETING'S CHANCE FOR SHOWING OFF
HE WAS
EAGER TO COMMENCE
HE UNDERTOOK THEREFORE THE ARDUOUS TASK OF
PERSUADING THE YOUNG LADIES TO FAVOUR THE COMPANY WITH AN AIR A SONG
CON AMORE HE WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF BEGGING PRAYING
RESISTING EXCUSES EXPLAINING AWAY DIFFICULTIES AND AT LAST SUCCEEDED
IN PERSUADING MISS HARRIET TO ALLOW HERSELF TO BE LED TO THE INSTRUMENT
THEN OUT CAME THE PIECES OF HIS FLUTE HE ALWAYS CARRIED THEM IN HIS
POCKET AS UNFAILINGLY AS HE CARRIED HIS HANDKERCHIEF
THEY WERE
SCREWED AND ARRANGED MALONE AND DONNE MEANWHILE HERDING TOGETHER AND
SNEERING AT HIM WHICH THE LITTLE MAN GLANCING OVER HIS SHOULDER SAW
BUT DID NOT HEED AT ALL
HE WAS PERSUADED THEIR SARCASM ALL AROSE FROM
ENVY
THEY COULD NOT ACCOMPANY THE LADIES AS HE COULD HE WAS ABOUT TO
ENJOY A TRIUMPH OVER THEM
THE TRIUMPH BEGAN
MALONE MUCH CHAGRINED AT HEARING HIM PIPE UP IN MOST
SUPERIOR STYLE DETERMINED TO EARN DISTINCTION TOO IF POSSIBLE AND
ALL AT ONCE ASSUMING THE CHARACTER OF A SWAIN WHICH CHARACTER HE HAD
ENDEAVOURED TO ENACT ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE BUT IN WHICH HE HAD NOT
HITHERTO MET WITH THE SUCCESS HE DOUBTLESS OPINED HIS MERITS DESERVED
APPROACHED A SOFA ON WHICH MISS HELSTONE WAS SEATED AND DEPOSITING HIS
GREAT IRISH FRAME NEAR HER TRIED HIS HAND OR RATHER TONGUE AT A FINE
SPEECH OR TWO ACCOMPANIED BY GRINS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND
INCOMPREHENSIBLE
IN THE COURSE OF HIS EFFORTS TO RENDER HIMSELF
AGREEABLE HE CONTRIVED TO POSSESS HIMSELF OF THE TWO LONG SOFA CUSHIONS
AND A SQUARE ONE WITH WHICH AFTER ROLLING THEM ABOUT FOR SOME TIME
WITH STRANGE GESTURES HE MANAGED TO ERECT A SORT OF BARRIER BETWEEN
HIMSELF AND THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTIONS
CAROLINE QUITE WILLING THAT
THEY SHOULD BE SUNDERED SOON DEVISED AN EXCUSE FOR STEPPING OVER TO THE
OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM AND TAKING UP A POSITION BESIDE MRS
SYKES
OF WHICH GOOD LADY SHE ENTREATED SOME INSTRUCTION IN A NEW STITCH IN
ORNAMENTAL KNITTING A FAVOUR READILY GRANTED AND THUS PETER AUGUSTUS
WAS THROWN OUT
VERY SULLENLY DID HIS COUNTENANCE LOWER WHEN HE SAW HIMSELF
ABANDONED LEFT ENTIRELY TO HIS OWN RESOURCES ON A LARGE SOFA WITH THE
CHARGE OF THREE SMALL CUSHIONS ON HIS HANDS
THE FACT WAS HE FELT
DISPOSED SERIOUSLY TO CULTIVATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISS HELSTONE BECAUSE
HE THOUGHT IN COMMON WITH OTHERS THAT HER UNCLE POSSESSED MONEY AND
CONCLUDED THAT SINCE HE HAD NO CHILDREN HE WOULD PROBABLY LEAVE IT TO
HIS NIECE
GRARD MOORE WAS BETTER INSTRUCTED ON THIS POINT HE HAD SEEN
THE NEAT CHURCH THAT OWED ITS ORIGIN TO THE RECTOR'S ZEAL AND CASH AND
MORE THAN ONCE IN HIS INMOST SOUL HAD CURSED AN EXPENSIVE CAPRICE
WHICH CROSSED HIS WISHES
THE EVENING SEEMED LONG TO ONE PERSON IN THAT ROOM
CAROLINE AT
INTERVALS DROPPED HER KNITTING ON HER LAP AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO A SORT
OF BRAIN LETHARGY CLOSING HER EYES AND DEPRESSING HER HEAD CAUSED BY
WHAT SEEMED TO HER THE UNMEANING HUM AROUND HER THE INHARMONIOUS
TASTELESS RATTLE OF THE PIANO KEYS THE SQUEAKING AND GASPING NOTES OF
THE FLUTE THE LAUGHTER AND MIRTH OF HER UNCLE AND HANNAH AND MARY
SHE COULD NOT TELL WHENCE ORIGINATING FOR SHE HEARD NOTHING COMIC OR
GLEEFUL IN THEIR DISCOURSE AND MORE THAN ALL BY THE INTERMINABLE
GOSSIP OF MRS
SYKES MURMURED CLOSE AT HER EAR GOSSIP WHICH RANG THE
CHANGES ON FOUR SUBJECTS HER OWN HEALTH AND THAT OF THE VARIOUS
MEMBERS OF HER FAMILY THE MISSIONARY AND JEW BASKETS AND THEIR
CONTENTS THE LATE MEETING AT NUNNELY AND ONE WHICH WAS EXPECTED TO
COME OFF NEXT WEEK AT WHINBURY
TIRED AT LENGTH TO EXHAUSTION SHE EMBRACED THE OPPORTUNITY OF MR
SWEETING COMING UP TO SPEAK TO MRS
SYKES TO SLIP QUIETLY OUT OF THE
APARTMENT AND SEEK A MOMENT'S RESPITE IN SOLITUDE
SHE REPAIRED TO THE
DINING ROOM WHERE THE CLEAR BUT NOW LOW REMNANT OF A FIRE STILL BURNED
IN THE GRATE
THE PLACE WAS EMPTY AND QUIET GLASSES AND DECANTERS WERE
CLEARED FROM THE TABLE THE CHAIRS WERE PUT BACK IN THEIR PLACES ALL
WAS ORDERLY
CAROLINE SANK INTO HER UNCLE'S LARGE EASY CHAIR HALF SHUT
HER EYES AND RESTED HERSELF RESTED AT LEAST HER LIMBS HER SENSES HER
HEARING HER VISION WEARY WITH LISTENING TO NOTHING AND GAZING ON
VACANCY
AS TO HER MIND THAT FLEW DIRECTLY TO THE HOLLOW
IT STOOD ON
THE THRESHOLD OF THE PARLOUR THERE THEN IT PASSED TO THE
COUNTING HOUSE AND WONDERED WHICH SPOT WAS BLESSED BY THE PRESENCE OF
ROBERT
IT SO HAPPENED THAT NEITHER LOCALITY HAD THAT HONOUR FOR ROBERT
WAS HALF A MILE AWAY FROM BOTH AND MUCH NEARER TO CAROLINE THAN HER
DEADENED SPIRIT SUSPECTED
HE WAS AT THIS MOMENT CROSSING THE
CHURCHYARD APPROACHING THE RECTORY GARDEN GATE NOT HOWEVER COMING TO
SEE HIS COUSIN BUT INTENT SOLELY ON COMMUNICATING A BRIEF PIECE OF
INTELLIGENCE TO THE RECTOR
YES CAROLINE YOU HEAR THE WIRE OF THE BELL VIBRATE IT RINGS AGAIN FOR
THE FIFTH TIME THIS AFTERNOON
YOU START AND YOU ARE CERTAIN NOW THAT
THIS MUST BE HE OF WHOM YOU DREAM
WHY YOU ARE SO CERTAIN YOU CANNOT
EXPLAIN TO YOURSELF BUT YOU KNOW IT
YOU LEAN FORWARD LISTENING
EAGERLY AS FANNY OPENS THE DOOR
RIGHT THAT IS THE VOICE LOW WITH
THE SLIGHT FOREIGN ACCENT BUT SO SWEET AS YOU FANCY
YOU HALF RISE
FANNY WILL TELL HIM MR
HELSTONE IS WITH COMPANY AND THEN HE WILL GO
AWAY OH SHE CANNOT LET HIM GO
IN SPITE OF HERSELF IN SPITE OF HER
REASON SHE WALKS HALF ACROSS THE ROOM SHE STANDS READY TO DART OUT IN
CASE THE STEP SHOULD RETREAT BUT HE ENTERS THE PASSAGE
SINCE YOUR
MASTER IS ENGAGED HE SAYS JUST SHOW ME INTO THE DINING ROOM
BRING
ME PEN AND INK
I WILL WRITE A SHORT NOTE AND LEAVE IT FOR HIM
NOW HAVING CAUGHT THESE WORDS AND HEARING HIM ADVANCE CAROLINE IF
THERE WAS A DOOR WITHIN THE DINING ROOM WOULD GLIDE THROUGH IT AND
DISAPPEAR
SHE FEELS CAUGHT HEMMED IN SHE DREADS HER UNEXPECTED
PRESENCE MAY ANNOY HIM
A SECOND SINCE SHE WOULD HAVE FLOWN TO HIM
THAT SECOND PAST SHE WOULD FLEE FROM HIM
SHE CANNOT
THERE IS NO WAY
OF ESCAPE
THE DINING ROOM HAS BUT ONE DOOR THROUGH WHICH NOW ENTERS
HER COUSIN
THE LOOK OF TROUBLED SURPRISE SHE EXPECTED TO SEE IN HIS
FACE HAS APPEARED THERE HAS SHOCKED HER AND IS GONE
SHE HAS STAMMERED
A SORT OF APOLOGY
I ONLY LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM A MINUTE FOR A LITTLE QUIET
THERE WAS SOMETHING SO DIFFIDENT AND DOWNCAST IN THE AIR AND TONE WITH
WHICH SHE SAID THIS ANY ONE MIGHT PERCEIVE THAT SOME SADDENING CHANGE
HAD LATELY PASSED OVER HER PROSPECTS AND THAT THE FACULTY OF CHEERFUL
SELF POSSESSION HAD LEFT HER
MR
MOORE PROBABLY REMEMBERED HOW SHE
HAD FORMERLY BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO MEET HIM WITH GENTLE ARDOUR AND HOPEFUL
CONFIDENCE
HE MUST HAVE SEEN HOW THE CHECK OF THIS MORNING HAD
OPERATED
HERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CARRYING OUT HIS NEW SYSTEM WITH
EFFECT IF HE CHOSE TO IMPROVE IT
PERHAPS HE FOUND IT EASIER TO
PRACTISE THAT SYSTEM IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN HIS MILL YARD AMIDST BUSY
OCCUPATIONS THAN IN A QUIET PARLOUR DISENGAGED AT THE HOUR OF
EVENTIDE
FANNY LIT THE CANDLES WHICH BEFORE HAD STOOD UNLIT ON THE
TABLE BROUGHT WRITING MATERIALS AND LEFT THE ROOM
CAROLINE WAS ABOUT
TO FOLLOW HER
MOORE TO ACT CONSISTENTLY SHOULD HAVE LET HER GO
WHEREAS HE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND GENTLY KEPT
HER BACK
HE DID NOT ASK HER TO STAY BUT HE WOULD NOT LET HER GO
SHALL I TELL MY UNCLE YOU ARE HERE ASKED SHE STILL IN THE SAME
SUBDUED VOICE
NO I CAN SAY TO YOU ALL I HAD TO SAY TO HIM
YOU WILL BE MY
MESSENGER
YES ROBERT
THEN YOU MAY JUST INFORM HIM THAT I HAVE GOT A CLUE TO THE IDENTITY OF
ONE AT LEAST OF THE MEN WHO BROKE MY FRAMES THAT HE BELONGS TO THE
SAME GANG WHO ATTACKED SYKES AND PEARSON'S DRESSING SHOP AND THAT I
HOPE TO HAVE HIM IN CUSTODY TO MORROW
YOU CAN REMEMBER THAT
OH YES THESE TWO MONOSYLLABLES WERE UTTERED IN A SADDER TONE THAN
EVER AND AS SHE SAID THEM SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SLIGHTLY AND SIGHED
WILL
YOU PROSECUTE HIM
DOUBTLESS
NO ROBERT
AND WHY NO CAROLINE
BECAUSE IT WILL SET ALL THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AGAINST YOU MORE THAN EVER
THAT IS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT DO MY DUTY AND DEFEND MY PROPERTY
THIS FELLOW IS A GREAT SCOUNDREL AND OUGHT TO BE INCAPACITATED FROM
PERPETRATING FURTHER MISCHIEF
BUT HIS ACCOMPLICES WILL TAKE REVENGE ON YOU
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW THE
PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY BEAR MALICE
IT IS THE BOAST OF SOME OF THEM THAT
THEY CAN KEEP A STONE IN THEIR POCKET SEVEN YEARS TURN IT AT THE END OF
THAT TIME KEEP IT SEVEN YEARS LONGER AND HURL IT AND HIT THEIR MARK
'AT LAST
MOORE LAUGHED
A MOST PITHY VAUNT SAID HE ONE THAT REDOUNDS VASTLY TO THE CREDIT
OF YOUR DEAR YORKSHIRE FRIENDS
BUT DON'T FEAR FOR ME LINA
I AM ON MY
GUARD AGAINST THESE LAMB LIKE COMPATRIOTS OF YOURS
DON'T MAKE YOURSELF
UNEASY ABOUT ME
HOW CAN I HELP IT YOU ARE MY COUSIN
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED SHE
STOPPED
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN LINA
TO SPEAK IN YOUR OWN LANGUAGE THERE IS A
PROVIDENCE ABOVE ALL IS THERE NOT
YES DEAR ROBERT
MAY HE GUARD YOU
AND IF PRAYERS HAVE EFFICACY YOURS WILL BENEFIT ME
YOU PRAY FOR ME
SOMETIMES
NOT SOMETIMES ROBERT
YOU AND LOUIS AND HORTENSE ARE ALWAYS
REMEMBERED
SO I HAVE OFTEN IMAGINED
IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME WHEN WEARY AND VEXED
I HAVE MYSELF GONE TO BED LIKE A HEATHEN THAT ANOTHER HAD ASKED
FORGIVENESS FOR MY DAY AND SAFETY FOR MY NIGHT
I DON'T SUPPOSE SUCH
VICARIAL PIETY WILL AVAIL MUCH BUT THE PETITIONS COME OUT OF A SINCERE
BREAST FROM INNOCENT LIPS
THEY SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE AS ABEL'S
OFFERING AND DOUBTLESS WOULD BE IF THE OBJECT DESERVED THEM
ANNIHILATE THAT DOUBT
IT IS GROUNDLESS
WHEN A MAN HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP ONLY TO MAKE MONEY AND LIVES TO MAKE
IT AND FOR NOTHING ELSE AND SCARCELY BREATHES ANY OTHER AIR THAN THAT
OF MILLS AND MARKETS IT SEEMS ODD TO UTTER HIS NAME IN A PRAYER OR TO
MIX HIS IDEA WITH ANYTHING DIVINE AND VERY STRANGE IT SEEMS THAT A
GOOD PURE HEART SHOULD TAKE HIM IN AND HARBOUR HIM AS IF HE HAD ANY
CLAIM TO THAT SORT OF NEST
IF I COULD GUIDE THAT BENIGNANT HEART I
BELIEVE I SHOULD COUNSEL IT TO EXCLUDE ONE WHO DOES NOT PROFESS TO HAVE
ANY HIGHER AIM IN LIFE THAN THAT OF PATCHING UP HIS BROKEN FORTUNE AND
WIPING CLEAN FROM HIS BOURGEOIS SCUTCHEON THE FOUL STAIN OF
BANKRUPTCY
THE HINT THOUGH CONVEYED THUS TENDERLY AND MODESTLY AS CAROLINE
THOUGHT WAS FELT KEENLY AND COMPREHENDED CLEARLY
INDEED I ONLY THINK OR I WILL ONLY THINK OF YOU AS MY COUSIN WAS
THE QUICK ANSWER
I AM BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THINGS BETTER THAN I
DID ROBERT WHEN YOU FIRST CAME TO ENGLAND BETTER THAN I DID A WEEK A
DAY AGO
I KNOW IT IS YOUR DUTY TO TRY TO GET ON AND THAT IT WON'T DO
FOR YOU TO BE ROMANTIC BUT IN FUTURE YOU MUST NOT MISUNDERSTAND ME IF I
SEEM FRIENDLY
YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME THIS MORNING DID YOU NOT
WHAT MADE YOU THINK SO
YOUR LOOK YOUR MANNER
BUT LOOK AT ME NOW
OH YOU ARE DIFFERENT NOW
AT PRESENT I DARE SPEAK TO YOU
YET I AM THE SAME EXCEPT THAT I HAVE LEFT THE TRADESMAN BEHIND ME IN
THE HOLLOW
YOUR KINSMAN ALONE STANDS BEFORE YOU
MY COUSIN ROBERT NOT MR
MOORE
NOT A BIT OF MR
MOORE
CAROLINE
HERE THE COMPANY WAS HEARD RISING IN THE OTHER ROOM
THE DOOR WAS
OPENED THE PONY CARRIAGE WAS ORDERED SHAWLS AND BONNETS WERE DEMANDED
MR
HELSTONE CALLED FOR HIS NIECE
I MUST GO ROBERT
YES YOU MUST GO OR THEY WILL COME IN AND FIND US HERE AND I RATHER
THAN MEET ALL THAT HOST IN THE PASSAGE WILL TAKE MY DEPARTURE THROUGH
THE WINDOW
LUCKILY IT OPENS LIKE A DOOR
ONE MINUTE ONLY PUT DOWN THE
CANDLE AN INSTANT GOOD NIGHT
I KISS YOU BECAUSE WE ARE COUSINS AND
BEING COUSINS ONE TWO THREE KISSES ARE ALLOWABLE
CAROLINE
GOOD NIGHT
CHAPTER VIII
NOAH AND MOSES
THE NEXT DAY MOORE HAD RISEN BEFORE THE SUN AND HAD TAKEN A RIDE TO
WHINBURY AND BACK ERE HIS SISTER HAD MADE THE CAF AU LAIT OR CUT THE
TARTINES FOR HIS BREAKFAST
WHAT BUSINESS HE TRANSACTED THERE HE KEPT TO
HIMSELF
HORTENSE ASKED NO QUESTIONS IT WAS NOT HER WONT TO COMMENT ON
HIS MOVEMENTS NOR HIS TO RENDER AN ACCOUNT OF THEM
THE SECRETS OF
BUSINESS COMPLICATED AND OFTEN DISMAL MYSTERIES WERE BURIED IN HIS
BREAST AND NEVER CAME OUT OF THEIR SEPULCHRE SAVE NOW AND THEN TO SCARE
JOE SCOTT OR GIVE A START TO SOME FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT
INDEED A
GENERAL HABIT OF RESERVE ON WHATEVER WAS IMPORTANT SEEMED BRED IN HIS
MERCANTILE BLOOD
BREAKFAST OVER HE WENT TO HIS COUNTING HOUSE
HENRY JOE SCOTT'S BOY
BROUGHT IN THE LETTERS AND THE DAILY PAPERS MOORE SEATED HIMSELF AT HIS
DESK BROKE THE SEALS OF THE DOCUMENTS AND GLANCED THEM OVER
THEY WERE
ALL SHORT BUT NOT IT SEEMED SWEET PROBABLY RATHER SOUR ON THE
CONTRARY FOR AS MOORE LAID DOWN THE LAST HIS NOSTRILS EMITTED A
DERISIVE AND DEFIANT SNUFF AND THOUGH HE BURST INTO NO SOLILOQUY THERE
WAS A GLANCE IN HIS EYE WHICH SEEMED TO INVOKE THE DEVIL AND LAY
CHARGES ON HIM TO SWEEP THE WHOLE CONCERN TO GEHENNA
HOWEVER HAVING
CHOSEN A PEN AND STRIPPED AWAY THE FEATHERED TOP IN A BRIEF SPASM OF
FINGER FURY ONLY FINGER FURY HIS FACE WAS PLACID HE DASHED OFF A
BATCH OF ANSWERS SEALED THEM AND THEN WENT OUT AND WALKED THROUGH THE
MILL
ON COMING BACK HE SAT DOWN TO READ HIS NEWSPAPER
THE CONTENTS SEEMED NOT ABSORBINGLY INTERESTING HE MORE THAN ONCE LAID
IT ACROSS HIS KNEE FOLDED HIS ARMS AND GAZED INTO THE FIRE HE
OCCASIONALLY TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE WINDOW HE LOOKED AT INTERVALS
AT HIS WATCH IN SHORT HIS MIND APPEARED PREOCCUPIED
PERHAPS HE WAS
THINKING OF THE BEAUTY OF THE WEATHER FOR IT WAS A FINE AND MILD
MORNING FOR THE SEASON AND WISHING TO BE OUT IN THE FIELDS ENJOYING
IT
THE DOOR OF HIS COUNTING HOUSE STOOD WIDE OPEN
THE BREEZE AND
SUNSHINE ENTERED FREELY BUT THE FIRST VISITANT BROUGHT NO SPRING
PERFUME ON ITS WINGS ONLY AN OCCASIONAL SULPHUR PUFF FROM THE
SOOT THICK COLUMN OF SMOKE RUSHING SABLE FROM THE GAUNT MILL CHIMNEY
A DARK BLUE APPARITION THAT OF JOE SCOTT FRESH FROM A DYEING VAT
APPEARED MOMENTARILY AT THE OPEN DOOR UTTERED THE WORDS HE'S COMED
SIR AND VANISHED
MR
MOORE RAISED NOT HIS EYES FROM THE PAPER
A LARGE MAN
BROAD SHOULDERED AND MASSIVE LIMBED CLAD IN FUSTIAN GARMENTS AND GRAY
WORSTED STOCKINGS ENTERED WHO WAS RECEIVED WITH A NOD AND DESIRED TO
TAKE A SEAT WHICH HE DID MAKING THE REMARK AS HE REMOVED HIS HAT A
VERY BAD ONE STOWED IT AWAY UNDER HIS CHAIR AND WIPED HIS FOREHEAD
WITH A SPOTTED COTTON HANDKERCHIEF EXTRACTED FROM THE HAT CROWN THAT IT
WAS RAIGHT DAHN WARM FOR FEBEWERRY MR
MOORE ASSENTED AT LEAST HE
UTTERED SOME SLIGHT SOUND WHICH THOUGH INARTICULATE MIGHT PASS FOR AN
ASSENT
THE VISITOR NOW CAREFULLY DEPOSITED IN THE CORNER BESIDE HIM AN
OFFICIAL LOOKING STAFF WHICH HE BORE IN HIS HAND THIS DONE HE
WHISTLED PROBABLY BY WAY OF APPEARING AT HIS EASE
YOU HAVE WHAT IS NECESSARY I SUPPOSE SAID MR
MOORE
AY AY ALL'S RIGHT
HE RENEWED HIS WHISTLING MR
MOORE HIS READING
THE PAPER APPARENTLY
HAD BECOME MORE INTERESTING
PRESENTLY HOWEVER HE TURNED TO HIS
CUPBOARD WHICH WAS WITHIN REACH OF HIS LONG ARM OPENED IT WITHOUT
RISING TOOK OUT A BLACK BOTTLE THE SAME HE HAD PRODUCED FOR MALONE'S
BENEFIT A TUMBLER AND A JUG PLACED THEM ON THE TABLE AND SAID TO HIS
GUEST
HELP YOURSELF THERE'S WATER IN THAT JAR IN THE CORNER
I DUNNUT KNAW THAT THERE'S MICH NEED FOR ALL A BODY IS DRY THIRSTY
IN A MORNING SAID THE FUSTIAN GENTLEMAN RISING AND DOING AS
REQUESTED
WILL YOU TAK NAUGHT YOURSELN MR
MOORE HE INQUIRED AS WITH SKILLED
HAND HE MIXED A PORTION AND HAVING TESTED IT BY A DEEP DRAUGHT SANK
BACK SATISFIED AND BLAND IN HIS SEAT
MOORE CHARY OF WORDS REPLIED BY
A NEGATIVE MOVEMENT AND MURMUR
YAH'D AS GOOD CONTINUED HIS VISITOR IT 'ULD SET YE UP WALD A SUP O'

IT STOPPED AND A WELL KNOWN
NASAL VOICE CRIED ALOUD BOY PROBABLY ADDRESSING HARRY SCOTT WHO
USUALLY HUNG ABOUT THE PREMISES FROM 9 A M

AND LEAD HIM INTO THE STABLE
HELSTONE CAME IN MARCHING NIMBLY AND ERECT LOOKING BROWNER KEENER AND
LIVELIER THAN USUAL

AND WHO IS IT ONE OF MY PARISHIONERS
JOE SCOTT HAD ENTERED UNOBSERVED
HE NOW STOOD A MOST SINISTER PHANTOM
HALF HIS PERSON BEING DYED OF THE DEEPEST TINT OF INDIGO LEANING ON THE
DESK
HIS MASTER'S ANSWER TO THE RECTOR'S QUESTION WAS A SMILE
JOE TOOK

HELSTONE A GENTLEMAN YOU OFTEN SPEAK OF
INDEED HIS NAME JOE YOU LOOK WELL THIS MORNING

HIMSELF A VERY LONG PINCH AH COULDN'T HAVE SUPPOSED IT
WHY THE
PIOUS MAN NEVER WAS A WORKMAN OF YOURS MOORE
HE'S A TAILOR BY TRADE
AND SO MUCH THE WORSE GRUDGE I OWE HIM FOR INTERFERING AND SETTING MY
DISCARDED MEN AGAINST ME
AND MOSES WAS ACTUALLY PRESENT AT THE BATTLE OF STILBRO' MOOR HE WENT
THERE WOODEN LEG AND ALL

FACES BLACKENED

I'LL TELL YOU SIR SAID JOE
T' MAISTER'S NOT SO FOND OF TALKING
I'VE NO OBJECTIONS
HE COURTED SARAH MR
MOORE'S SARVANT LASS AND SO

HIS WOODEN LEG OR SHE'D SOME NOTION ABOUT HIS BEING A HYPOCRITE
HAPPEN
FOR WOMEN IS QUEER HANDS WE MAY SAY THAT AMANG WERSELN WHEN THERE'S
NONE OF 'EM NIGH SHE'D HAVE ENCOURAGED HIM IN SPITE OF HIS LEG AND HIS

WALK WI' THEM
THEY FELL OUT HAD A TUSSLE AND FRED WAS WORSTED FOR
HE'S YOUNG AND SMALL AND BARRACLOUGH FOR ALL HE HAS ONLY ONE LEG IS
ALMOST AS STRONG AS SUGDEN THERE INDEED ANYBODY THAT HEARS HIM ROARING
AT A REVIVAL OR A LOVE FEAST MAY BE SURE HE'S NO WEAKLING
JOE YOU'RE INSUPPORTABLE HERE BROKE IN MR
MOORE
YOU SPIN OUT YOUR
EXPLANATION AS MOSES SPINS OUT HIS SERMONS
THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT IS
MURGATROYD WAS JEALOUS OF BARRACLOUGH AND LAST NIGHT AS HE AND A
FRIEND TOOK SHELTER IN A BARN FROM A SHOWER THEY HEARD AND SAW MOSES
CONFERRING WITH SOME ASSOCIATES WITHIN
FROM THEIR DISCOURSE IT WAS
PLAIN HE HAD BEEN THE LEADER NOT ONLY AT STILBRO' MOOR BUT IN THE
ATTACK ON SYKES'S PROPERTY
MOREOVER THEY PLANNED A DEPUTATION TO WAIT
ON ME THIS MORNING WHICH THE TAILOR IS TO HEAD AND WHICH IN THE MOST
RELIGIOUS AND PEACEFUL SPIRIT IS TO ENTREAT ME TO PUT THE ACCURSED
THING OUT OF MY TENT
I RODE OVER TO WHINBURY THIS MORNING GOT A
CONSTABLE AND A WARRANT AND I AM NOW WAITING TO GIVE MY FRIEND THE
RECEPTION HE DESERVES
HERE MEANTIME COMES SYKES
MR
HELSTONE YOU
MUST SPIRIT HIM UP
HE FEELS TIMID AT THE THOUGHTS OF PROSECUTING
A GIG WAS HEARD TO ROLL INTO THE YARD
MR
SYKES ENTERED A TALL STOUT
MAN OF ABOUT FIFTY COMELY OF FEATURE BUT FEEBLE OF PHYSIOGNOMY
HE
LOOKED ANXIOUS
HAVE THEY BEEN ARE THEY GONE HAVE YOU GOT HIM IS IT OVER HE ASKED
NOT YET RETURNED MOORE WITH PHLEGM
WE ARE WAITING FOR THEM
THEY'LL NOT COME IT'S NEAR NOON
BETTER GIVE IT UP
IT WILL EXCITE BAD
FEELING MAKE A STIR CAUSE PERHAPS FATAL CONSEQUENCES
YOU NEED NOT APPEAR SAID MOORE
I SHALL MEET THEM IN THE YARD WHEN
THEY COME YOU CAN STAY HERE
BUT MY NAME MUST BE SEEN IN THE LAW PROCEEDINGS
A WIFE AND FAMILY MR
MOORE A WIFE AND FAMILY MAKE A MAN CAUTIOUS
MOORE LOOKED DISGUSTED
GIVE WAY IF YOU PLEASE SAID HE LEAVE ME TO
MYSELF
I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO ACT ALONE ONLY BE ASSURED YOU WILL NOT
FIND SAFETY IN SUBMISSION
YOUR PARTNER PEARSON GAVE WAY AND CONCEDED
AND FORBORE
WELL THAT DID NOT PREVENT THEM FROM ATTEMPTING TO SHOOT
HIM IN HIS OWN HOUSE
MY DEAR SIR TAKE A LITTLE WINE AND WATER RECOMMENDED MR
HELSTONE
THE WINE AND WATER WAS HOLLANDS AND WATER AS MR
SYKES DISCOVERED WHEN
HE HAD COMPOUNDED AND SWALLOWED A BRIMMING TUMBLER THEREOF
IT
TRANSFIGURED HIM IN TWO MINUTES BROUGHT THE COLOUR BACK TO HIS FACE
AND MADE HIM AT LEAST WORD VALIANT
HE NOW ANNOUNCED THAT HE HOPED HE
WAS ABOVE BEING TRAMPLED ON BY THE COMMON PEOPLE HE WAS DETERMINED TO
ENDURE THE INSOLENCE OF THE WORKING CLASSES NO LONGER HE HAD CONSIDERED
OF IT AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO ALL LENGTHS IF MONEY AND SPIRIT COULD
PUT DOWN THESE RIOTERS THEY SHOULD BE PUT DOWN MR
MOORE MIGHT DO AS
HE LIKED BUT HE CHRISTIE SYKES WOULD SPEND HIS LAST PENNY IN LAW
BEFORE HE WOULD BE BEATEN HE'D SETTLE THEM OR HE'D SEE
TAKE ANOTHER GLASS URGED MOORE
MR
SYKES DIDN'T MIND IF HE DID
THIS WAS A COLD MORNING SUGDEN HAD
FOUND IT A WARM ONE IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE CAREFUL AT THIS SEASON OF
THE YEAR IT WAS PROPER TO TAKE SOMETHING TO KEEP THE DAMP OUT HE HAD A
LITTLE COUGH ALREADY HERE HE COUGHED IN ATTESTATION OF THE FACT
SOMETHING OF THIS SORT LIFTING THE BLACK BOTTLE WAS EXCELLENT TAKEN
MEDICINALLY HE POURED THE PHYSIC INTO HIS TUMBLER HE DIDN'T MAKE A
PRACTICE OF DRINKING SPIRITS IN A MORNING BUT OCCASIONALLY IT REALLY
WAS PRUDENT TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS
QUITE PRUDENT AND TAKE THEM BY ALL MEANS URGED THE HOST
MR
SYKES NOW ADDRESSED MR
HELSTONE WHO STOOD ON THE HEARTH HIS
SHOVEL HAT ON HIS HEAD WATCHING HIM SIGNIFICANTLY WITH HIS LITTLE KEEN
EYES
YOU SIR AS A CLERGYMAN SAID HE MAY FEEL IT DISAGREEABLE TO BE
PRESENT AMIDST SCENES OF HURRY AND FLURRY AND I MAY SAY PERIL
I DARE
SAY YOUR NERVES WON'T STAND IT
YOU'RE A MAN OF PEACE SIR BUT WE
MANUFACTURERS LIVING IN THE WORLD AND ALWAYS IN TURMOIL GET QUITE
BELLIGERENT
REALLY THERE'S AN ARDOUR EXCITED BY THE THOUGHTS OF DANGER
THAT MAKES MY HEART PANT
WHEN MRS
SYKES IS AFRAID OF THE HOUSE BEING
ATTACKED AND BROKE OPEN AS SHE IS EVERY NIGHT I GET QUITE EXCITED
I
COULDN'T DESCRIBE TO YOU SIR MY FEELINGS
REALLY IF ANYBODY WAS TO
COME THIEVES OR ANYTHING I BELIEVE I SHOULD ENJOY IT SUCH IS MY
SPIRIT
THE HARDEST OF LAUGHS THOUGH BRIEF AND LOW AND BY NO MEANS INSULTING
WAS THE RESPONSE OF THE RECTOR
MOORE WOULD HAVE PRESSED UPON THE HEROIC
MILL OWNER A THIRD TUMBLER BUT THE CLERGYMAN WHO NEVER TRANSGRESSED
NOR WOULD SUFFER OTHERS IN HIS PRESENCE TO TRANSGRESS THE BOUNDS OF
DECORUM CHECKED HIM
ENOUGH IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST IS IT NOT MR
SYKES HE SAID AND MR
SYKES ASSENTED AND THEN SAT AND WATCHED JOE SCOTT REMOVE THE BOTTLE AT
A SIGN FROM HELSTONE WITH A SELF SATISFIED SIMPER ON HIS LIPS AND A
REGRETFUL GLISTEN IN HIS EYE
MOORE LOOKED AS IF HE SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO
FOOL HIM TO THE TOP OF HIS BENT
WHAT WOULD A CERTAIN YOUNG KINSWOMAN OF
HIS HAVE SAID COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HER DEAR GOOD GREAT ROBERT HER
CORIOLANUS JUST NOW WOULD SHE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED IN THAT MISCHIEVOUS
SARDONIC VISAGE THE SAME FACE TO WHICH SHE HAD LOOKED UP WITH SUCH LOVE
WHICH HAD BENT OVER HER WITH SUCH GENTLENESS LAST NIGHT WAS THAT THE
MAN WHO HAD SPENT SO QUIET AN EVENING WITH HIS SISTER AND HIS COUSIN SO
SUAVE TO ONE SO TENDER TO THE OTHER READING SHAKESPEARE AND LISTENING
TO CHNIER
YES IT WAS THE SAME MAN ONLY SEEN ON A DIFFERENT SIDE A SIDE CAROLINE
HAD NOT YET FAIRLY BEHELD THOUGH PERHAPS SHE HAD ENOUGH SAGACITY
FAINTLY TO SUSPECT ITS EXISTENCE
WELL CAROLINE HAD DOUBTLESS HER
DEFECTIVE SIDE TOO
SHE WAS HUMAN
SHE MUST THEN HAVE BEEN VERY
IMPERFECT AND HAD SHE SEEN MOORE ON HIS VERY WORST SIDE SHE WOULD
PROBABLY HAVE SAID THIS TO HERSELF AND EXCUSED HIM
LOVE CAN EXCUSE
ANYTHING EXCEPT MEANNESS BUT MEANNESS KILLS LOVE CRIPPLES EVEN NATURAL
AFFECTION WITHOUT ESTEEM TRUE LOVE CANNOT EXIST
MOORE WITH ALL HIS
FAULTS MIGHT BE ESTEEMED FOR HE HAD NO MORAL SCROFULA IN HIS MIND NO
HOPELESS POLLUTING TAINT SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS THAT OF FALSEHOOD
NEITHER WAS HE THE SLAVE OF HIS APPETITES
THE ACTIVE LIFE TO WHICH HE
HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED HAD GIVEN HIM SOMETHING ELSE TO DO THAN TO JOIN
THE FUTILE CHASE OF THE PLEASURE HUNTER
HE WAS A MAN UNDEGRADED THE
DISCIPLE OF REASON NOT THE VOTARY OF SENSE
THE SAME MIGHT BE SAID OF
OLD HELSTONE
NEITHER OF THESE TWO WOULD LOOK THINK OR SPEAK A LIE
FOR NEITHER OF THEM HAD THE WRETCHED BLACK BOTTLE WHICH HAD JUST BEEN
PUT AWAY ANY CHARMS
BOTH MIGHT BOAST A VALID CLAIM TO THE PROUD TITLE
OF LORD OF THE CREATION FOR NO ANIMAL VICE WAS LORD OF THEM THEY
LOOKED AND WERE SUPERIOR BEINGS TO POOR SYKES
A SORT OF GATHERING AND TRAMPLING SOUND WAS HEARD IN THE YARD AND THEN
A PAUSE
MOORE WALKED TO THE WINDOW HELSTONE FOLLOWED
BOTH STOOD ON
ONE SIDE THE TALL JUNIOR BEHIND THE UNDER SIZED SENIOR LOOKING FORTH
CAREFULLY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE VISIBLE FROM WITHOUT
THEIR SOLE
COMMENT ON WHAT THEY SAW WAS A CYNICAL SMILE FLASHED INTO EACH OTHER'S
STERN EYES
A FLOURISHING ORATORICAL COUGH WAS NOW HEARD FOLLOWED BY THE
INTERJECTION WHISHT DESIGNED AS IT SEEMED TO STILL THE HUM OF
SEVERAL VOICES
MOORE OPENED HIS CASEMENT AN INCH OR TWO TO ADMIT SOUND
MORE FREELY
JOSEPH SCOTT BEGAN A SNUFFLING VOICE SCOTT WAS STANDING SENTINEL AT
THE COUNTING HOUSE DOOR MIGHT WE INQUIRE IF YOUR MASTER BE WITHIN AND
IS TO BE SPOKEN TO
HE'S WITHIN AY SAID JOE NONCHALANTLY
WOULD YOU THEN IF YOU PLEASE EMPHASIS ON YOU HAVE THE
GOODNESS TO TELL HIM THAT TWELVE GENTLEMEN WANTS TO SEE HIM
HE'D HAPPEN AX WHAT FOR SUGGESTED JOE
I MUGHT AS WEEL TELL HIM THAT
AT T' SAME TIME
FOR A PURPOSE WAS THE ANSWER
JOE ENTERED
PLEASE SIR THERE'S TWELVE GENTLEMEN WANTS TO SEE YE 'FOR A
PURPOSE
GOOD JOE I'M THEIR MAN SUGDEN COME WHEN I WHISTLE
MOORE WENT OUT CHUCKLING DRYLY
HE ADVANCED INTO THE YARD ONE HAND IN
HIS POCKET THE OTHER IN HIS WAISTCOAT HIS CAP BRIM OVER HIS EYES
SHADING IN SOME MEASURE THEIR DEEP DANCING RAY OF SCORN
TWELVE MEN
WAITED IN THE YARD SOME IN THEIR SHIRT SLEEVES SOME IN BLUE APRONS
TWO FIGURED CONSPICUOUSLY IN THE VAN OF THE PARTY
ONE A LITTLE DAPPER
STRUTTING MAN WITH A TURNED UP NOSE THE OTHER A BROAD SHOULDERED
FELLOW DISTINGUISHED NO LESS BY HIS DEMURE FACE AND CAT LIKE TRUSTLESS
EYES THAN BY A WOODEN LEG AND STOUT CRUTCH
THERE WAS A KIND OF LEER
ABOUT HIS LIPS HE SEEMED LAUGHING IN HIS SLEEVE AT SOME PERSON OR
THING HIS WHOLE AIR WAS ANYTHING BUT THAT OF A TRUE MAN
GOOD MORNING MR
BARRACLOUGH SAID MOORE DEBONAIRLY FOR HIM
PEACE BE UNTO YOU WAS THE ANSWER MR
BARRACLOUGH ENTIRELY CLOSING
HIS NATURALLY HALF SHUT EYES AS HE DELIVERED IT
I'M OBLIGED TO YOU
PEACE IS AN EXCELLENT THING THERE'S NOTHING I MORE
WISH FOR MYSELF
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY TO ME I SUPPOSE I
IMAGINE PEACE IS NOT YOUR PURPOSE
AS TO OUR PURPOSE BEGAN BARRACLOUGH IT'S ONE THAT MAY SOUND STRANGE
AND PERHAPS FOOLISH TO EARS LIKE YOURS FOR THE CHILDER OF THIS WORLD IS
WISER IN THEIR GENERATION THAN THE CHILDER OF LIGHT
TO THE POINT IF YOU PLEASE AND LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS
YE'SE HEAR SIR
IF I CANNOT GET IT OFF THERE'S ELEVEN BEHINT CAN HELP
ME
IT IS A GRAND PURPOSE AND CHANGING HIS VOICE FROM A HALF SNEER TO
A WHINE IT'S THE LOOARD'S OWN PURPOSE AND THAT'S BETTER
DO YOU WANT A SUBSCRIPTION TO A NEW RANTER'S CHAPEL MR
BARRACLOUGH
UNLESS YOUR ERRAND BE SOMETHING OF THAT SORT I CANNOT SEE WHAT YOU HAVE
TO DO WITH IT
I HADN'T THAT DUTY ON MY MIND SIR BUT AS PROVIDENCE HAS LED YE TO
MENTION THE SUBJECT I'LL MAKE IT I' MY WAY TO TAK ONY TRIFLE YE MAY
HAVE TO SPARE THE SMALLEST CONTRIBUTION WILL BE ACCEPTABLE
WITH THAT HE DOFFED HIS HAT AND HELD IT OUT AS A BEGGING BOX A BRAZEN
GRIN AT THE SAME TIME CROSSING HIS COUNTENANCE
IF I GAVE YOU SIXPENCE YOU WOULD DRINK IT
BARRACLOUGH UPLIFTED THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS AND THE WHITES OF HIS EYES
EVINCING IN THE GESTURE A MERE BURLESQUE OF HYPOCRISY
YOU SEEM A FINE FELLOW SAID MOORE QUITE COOLLY AND DRYLY YOU DON'T
CARE FOR SHOWING ME THAT YOU ARE A DOUBLE DYED HYPOCRITE THAT YOUR
TRADE IS FRAUD
YOU EXPECT INDEED TO MAKE ME LAUGH AT THE CLEVERNESS
WITH WHICH YOU PLAY YOUR COARSELY FARCICAL PART WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
YOU THINK YOU ARE DECEIVING THE MEN BEHIND YOU
MOSES' COUNTENANCE LOWERED
HE SAW HE HAD GONE TOO FAR
HE WAS GOING TO
ANSWER WHEN THE SECOND LEADER IMPATIENT OF BEING HITHERTO KEPT IN THE
BACKGROUND STEPPED FORWARD
THIS MAN DID NOT LOOK LIKE A TRAITOR
THOUGH HE HAD AN EXCEEDINGLY SELF CONFIDENT AND CONCEITED AIR
MR
MOORE COMMENCED HE SPEAKING ALSO IN HIS THROAT AND NOSE AND
ENUNCIATING EACH WORD VERY SLOWLY AS IF WITH A VIEW TO GIVING HIS
AUDIENCE TIME TO APPRECIATE FULLY THE UNCOMMON ELEGANCE OF THE
PHRASEOLOGY IT MIGHT PERHAPS JUSTLY BE SAID THAT REASON RATHER THAN
PEACE IS OUR PURPOSE
WE COME IN THE FIRST PLACE TO REQUEST YOU TO
HEAR REASON AND SHOULD YOU REFUSE IT IS MY DUTY TO WARN YOU IN
VERY DECIDED TERMS THAT MEASURES WILL BE HAD RESORT TO HE MEANT
RECOURSE WHICH WILL PROBABLY TERMINATE IN IN BRINGING YOU TO A
SENSE OF THE UNWISDOM OF THE THE FOOLISHNESS WHICH SEEMS TO GUIDE AND
GUARD YOUR PROCEEDINGS AS A TRADESMAN IN THIS MANUFACTURING PART OF THE
COUNTRY
HEM SIR I WOULD BEG TO ALLUDE THAT AS A FURRINER COMING FROM
A DISTANT COAST ANOTHER QUARTER AND HEMISPHERE OF THIS GLOBE THROWN
AS I MAY SAY A PERFECT OUTCAST ON THESE SHORES THE CLIFFS OF
ALBION YOU HAVE NOT THAT UNDERSTANDING OF HUZ AND WER WAYS WHICH MIGHT

CASTING A SOMEWHAT IREFUL GLANCE AT NOAH O' TIM'S HE LAUNCHED OUT IN
HIS TURN AND NOW HE SPOKE IN A SERIOUS TONE RELINQUISHING THE SARCASM
WHICH HE FOUND HAD NOT ANSWERED

MOORE WE LIVED
I' PEACE AND QUIETNESS YEA I MAY SAY IN ALL LOVING KINDNESS
I AM NOT
MYSELF AN AGED PERSON AS YET BUT I CAN REMEMBER AS FAR BACK AS MAYBE
SOME TWENTY YEAR WHEN HAND LABOUR WERE ENCOURAGED AND RESPECTED AND NO
MISCHIEF MAKER HAD VENTURED TO INTRODUCE THESE HERE MACHINES WHICH IS SO
PERNICIOUS
NOW I'M NOT A CLOTH DRESSER MYSELF BUT BY TRADE A TAILOR

BARRACLOUGH

ROADSIDE AS I RETURNED FROM STILBRO' MARKET AND WHILE YOU PREACH
PEACE YOU MAKE IT THE BUSINESS OF YOUR LIFE TO STIR UP DISSENSION

DOES THE INDIVIDUAL CALLED NOAH OF TIM'S
YOU TWO ARE RESTLESS
MEDDLING IMPUDENT SCOUNDRELS WHOSE CHIEF MOTIVE PRINCIPLE IS A SELFISH
AMBITION AS DANGEROUS AS IT IS PUERILE

OF THEM HONEST THOUGH MISGUIDED MEN BUT YOU TWO I COUNT ALTOGETHER
BAD
BARRACLOUGH WAS GOING TO SPEAK
SILENCE YOU HAVE HAD YOUR SAY AND NOW I WILL HAVE MINE
AS TO BEING
DICTATED TO BY YOU OR ANY JACK JEM OR JONATHAN ON EARTH I SHALL NOT
SUFFER IT FOR A MOMENT
YOU DESIRE ME TO QUIT THE COUNTRY YOU REQUEST
ME TO PART WITH MY MACHINERY
IN CASE I REFUSE YOU THREATEN ME
I DO
REFUSE POINT BLANK HERE I STAY AND BY THIS MILL I STAND AND INTO IT
WILL I CONVEY THE BEST MACHINERY INVENTORS CAN FURNISH
WHAT WILL YOU
DO THE UTMOST YOU CAN DO AND THIS YOU WILL NEVER DARE TO DO IS TO
BURN DOWN MY MILL DESTROY ITS CONTENTS AND SHOOT ME
WHAT THEN
SUPPOSE THAT BUILDING WAS A RUIN AND I WAS A CORPSE WHAT THEN YOU LADS
BEHIND THESE TWO SCAMPS WOULD THAT STOP INVENTION OR EXHAUST SCIENCE
NOT FOR THE FRACTION OF A SECOND OF TIME ANOTHER AND BETTER GIG MILL
WOULD RISE ON THE RUINS OF THIS AND PERHAPS A MORE ENTERPRISING OWNER
COME IN MY PLACE
HEAR ME I'LL MAKE MY CLOTH AS I PLEASE AND ACCORDING
TO THE BEST LIGHTS I HAVE
IN ITS MANUFACTURE I WILL EMPLOY WHAT MEANS I
CHOOSE
WHOEVER AFTER HEARING THIS SHALL DARE TO INTERFERE WITH ME MAY
JUST TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES
AN EXAMPLE SHALL PROVE I'M IN EARNEST
HE WHISTLED SHRILL AND LOUD
SUGDEN HIS STAFF AND WARRANT CAME ON THE
SCENE
MOORE TURNED SHARPLY TO BARRACLOUGH
YOU WERE AT STILBRO' SAID HE I
HAVE PROOF OF THAT
YOU WERE ON THE MOOR YOU WORE A MASK YOU KNOCKED
DOWN ONE OF MY MEN WITH YOUR OWN HAND YOU A PREACHER OF THE
GOSPEL SUGDEN ARREST HIM
MOSES WAS CAPTURED
THERE WAS A CRY AND A RUSH TO RESCUE BUT THE RIGHT
HAND WHICH ALL THIS WHILE HAD LAIN HIDDEN IN MOORE'S BREAST
REAPPEARING HELD OUT A PISTOL
BOTH BARRELS ARE LOADED SAID HE
I'M QUITE DETERMINED KEEP OFF
STEPPING BACKWARDS FACING THE FOE AS HE WENT HE GUARDED HIS PREY TO
THE COUNTING HOUSE
HE ORDERED JOE SCOTT TO PASS IN WITH SUGDEN AND THE
PRISONER AND TO BOLT THE DOOR INSIDE
FOR HIMSELF HE WALKED BACKWARDS
AND FORWARDS ALONG THE FRONT OF THE MILL LOOKING MEDITATIVELY ON THE
GROUND HIS HAND HANGING CARELESSLY BY HIS SIDE BUT STILL HOLDING THE
PISTOL
THE ELEVEN REMAINING DEPUTIES WATCHED HIM SOME TIME TALKING
UNDER THEIR BREATH TO EACH OTHER
AT LENGTH ONE OF THEM APPROACHED
THIS
MAN LOOKED VERY DIFFERENT FROM EITHER OF THE TWO WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY
SPOKEN HE WAS HARD FAVOURED BUT MODEST AND MANLY LOOKING
I'VE NOT MUCH FAITH I' MOSES BARRACLOUGH SAID HE AND I WOULD SPEAK
A WORD TO YOU MYSELN MR
MOORE
IT'S OUT O' NO ILL WILL THAT I'M HERE
FOR MY PART IT'S JUST TO MAK A EFFORT TO GET THINGS STRAIGHTENED FOR
THEY'RE SORELY A CROOKED
YE SEE WE'RE ILL OFF VARRY ILL OFF WER
FAMILIES IS POOR AND PINED
WE'RE THROWN OUT O' WORK WI' THESE FRAMES
WE CAN GET NOUGHT TO DO WE CAN EARN NOUGHT
WHAT IS TO BE DONE MUN WE
SAY WISHT AND LIG US DOWN AND DEE NAY I'VE NO GRAND WORDS AT MY
TONGUE'S END MR
MOORE BUT I FEEL THAT IT WAD BE A LOW PRINCIPLE FOR A
REASONABLE MAN TO STARVE TO DEATH LIKE A DUMB CRATUR
I WILLN'T DO'T
I'M NOT FOR SHEDDING BLOOD I'D NEITHER KILL A MAN NOR HURT A MAN AND
I'M NOT FOR PULLING DOWN MILLS AND BREAKING MACHINES FOR AS YE SAY
THAT WAY O' GOING ON'LL NIVER STOP INVENTION BUT I'LL TALK I'LL MAK AS
BIG A DIN AS EVER I CAN
INVENTION MAY BE ALL RIGHT BUT I KNOW IT ISN'T
RIGHT FOR POOR FOLKS TO STARVE
THEM THAT GOVERNS MUN FIND A WAY TO HELP
US THEY MUN MAKE FRESH ORDERATIONS
YE'LL SAY THAT'S HARD TO DO
SO
MICH LOUDER MUN WE SHOUT OUT THEN FOR SO MUCH SLACKER WILL T'
PARLIAMENT MEN BE TO SET ON TO A TOUGH JOB

YOUR HUNGRY CHILDREN'S MOUTHS WILLIAM FARREN NEITHER TO YOUR DICTATION
NOR TO THAT OF ANY OTHER WILL I SUBMIT
TALK TO ME NO MORE ABOUT
MACHINERY
I WILL HAVE MY OWN WAY
I SHALL GET NEW FRAMES IN TO MORROW
IF YOU BROKE THESE I WOULD STILL GET MORE
I'LL NEVER GIVE IN
HERE THE MILL BELL RANG TWELVE O'CLOCK
IT WAS THE DINNER HOUR
MOORE
ABRUPTLY TURNED FROM THE DEPUTATION AND RE ENTERED HIS COUNTING HOUSE
HIS LAST WORDS HAD LEFT A BAD HARSH IMPRESSION HE AT LEAST HAD
FAILED IN THE DISPOSING OF A CHANCE HE WAS LORD OF BY SPEAKING KINDLY
TO WILLIAM FARREN WHO WAS A VERY HONEST MAN WITHOUT ENVY OR HATRED OF
THOSE MORE HAPPILY CIRCUMSTANCED THAN HIMSELF THINKING IT NO HARDSHIP
AND NO INJUSTICE TO BE FORCED TO LIVE BY LABOUR DISPOSED TO BE
HONOURABLY CONTENT IF HE COULD BUT GET WORK TO DO MOORE MIGHT HAVE MADE
A FRIEND
IT SEEMED WONDERFUL HOW HE COULD TURN FROM SUCH A MAN WITHOUT
A CONCILIATORY OR A SYMPATHIZING EXPRESSION
THE POOR FELLOW'S FACE
LOOKED HAGGARD WITH WANT HE HAD THE ASPECT OF A MAN WHO HAD NOT KNOWN
WHAT IT WAS TO LIVE IN COMFORT AND PLENTY FOR WEEKS PERHAPS MONTHS
PAST AND YET THERE WAS NO FEROCITY NO MALIGNITY IN HIS COUNTENANCE IT
WAS WORN DEJECTED AUSTERE BUT STILL PATIENT
HOW COULD MOORE LEAVE
HIM THUS WITH THE WORDS I'LL NEVER GIVE IN AND NOT A WHISPER OF
GOOD WILL OR HOPE OR AID
FARREN AS HE WENT HOME TO HIS COTTAGE ONCE IN BETTER TIMES A DECENT
CLEAN PLEASANT PLACE BUT NOW THOUGH STILL CLEAN VERY DREARY BECAUSE
SO POOR ASKED HIMSELF THIS QUESTION
HE CONCLUDED THAT THE FOREIGN
MILL OWNER WAS A SELFISH AN UNFEELING AND HE THOUGHT TOO A FOOLISH
MAN
IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT EMIGRATION HAD HE ONLY THE MEANS TO
EMIGRATE WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO SERVICE UNDER SUCH A MASTER
HE FELT
MUCH CAST DOWN ALMOST HOPELESS
ON HIS ENTRANCE HIS WIFE SERVED OUT IN ORDERLY SORT SUCH DINNER AS SHE
HAD TO GIVE HIM AND THE BAIRNS
IT WAS ONLY PORRIDGE AND TOO LITTLE OF
THAT
SOME OF THE YOUNGER CHILDREN ASKED FOR MORE WHEN THEY HAD DONE
THEIR PORTION AN APPLICATION WHICH DISTURBED WILLIAM MUCH
WHILE HIS
WIFE QUIETED THEM AS WELL AS SHE COULD HE LEFT HIS SEAT AND WENT TO THE
DOOR
HE WHISTLED A CHEERY STAVE WHICH DID NOT HOWEVER PREVENT A
BROAD DROP OR TWO MUCH MORE LIKE THE FIRST OF A THUNDER SHOWER THAN
THOSE WHICH OOZED FROM THE WOUND OF THE GLADIATOR FROM GATHERING ON THE
LIDS OF HIS GRAY EYES AND PLASHING THENCE TO THE THRESHOLD
HE CLEARED
HIS VISION WITH HIS SLEEVE AND THE MELTING MOOD OVER A VERY STERN ONE
FOLLOWED
HE STILL STOOD BROODING IN SILENCE WHEN A GENTLEMAN IN BLACK CAME UP A
CLERGYMAN IT MIGHT BE SEEN AT ONCE BUT NEITHER HELSTONE NOR MALONE
NOR DONNE NOR SWEETING
HE MIGHT BE FORTY YEARS OLD HE WAS
PLAIN LOOKING DARK COMPLEXIONED AND ALREADY RATHER GRAY HAIRED
HE
STOOPED A LITTLE IN WALKING
HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE CAME ON WORE AN
ABSTRACTED AND SOMEWHAT DOLEFUL AIR BUT IN APPROACHING FARREN HE LOOKED
UP AND THEN A HEARTY EXPRESSION ILLUMINATED THE PREOCCUPIED SERIOUS
FACE
IS IT YOU WILLIAM HOW ARE YOU HE ASKED
MIDDLING MR
HALL
HOW ARE YE WILL YE STEP IN AND REST YE
MR
HALL WHOSE NAME THE READER HAS SEEN MENTIONED BEFORE AND WHO
INDEED WAS VICAR OF NUNNELY OF WHICH PARISH FARREN WAS A NATIVE AND
FROM WHENCE HE HAD REMOVED BUT THREE YEARS AGO TO RESIDE IN BRIARFIELD
FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF BEING NEAR HOLLOW'S MILL WHERE HE HAD OBTAINED
WORK ENTERED THE COTTAGE AND HAVING GREETED THE GOOD WIFE AND THE
CHILDREN SAT DOWN
HE PROCEEDED TO TALK VERY CHEERFULLY ABOUT THE
LENGTH OF TIME THAT HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE FAMILY QUITTED HIS PARISH THE
CHANGES WHICH HAD OCCURRED SINCE HE ANSWERED QUESTIONS TOUCHING HIS
SISTER MARGARET WHO WAS INQUIRED AFTER WITH MUCH INTEREST HE ASKED
QUESTIONS IN HIS TURN AND AT LAST GLANCING HASTILY AND ANXIOUSLY ROUND
THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES HE WORE SPECTACLES FOR HE WAS SHORT SIGHTED AT
THE BARE ROOM AND AT THE MEAGRE AND WAN FACES OF THE CIRCLE ABOUT
HIM FOR THE CHILDREN HAD COME ROUND HIS KNEE AND THE FATHER AND MOTHER
STOOD BEFORE HIM HE SAID ABRUPTLY
AND HOW ARE YOU ALL HOW DO YOU GET ON
MR
HALL BE IT REMARKED THOUGH AN ACCOMPLISHED SCHOLAR NOT ONLY SPOKE
WITH A STRONG NORTHERN ACCENT BUT ON OCCASION USED FREELY
NORTH COUNTRY EXPRESSIONS
WE GET ON POORLY SAID WILLIAM WE'RE ALL OUT OF WORK
I'VE SELLED
MOST O' T' HOUSEHOLD STUFF AS YE MAY SEE AND WHAT WE'RE TO DO NEXT
GOD KNOWS
HAS MR
MOORE TURNED YOU OFF
HE HAS TURNED US OFF AND I'VE SICH AN OPINION OF HIM NOW THAT I THINK
IF HE'D TAK ME ON AGAIN TO MORROW I WOULDN'T WORK FOR HIM
IT IS NOT LIKE YOU TO SAY SO WILLIAM
I KNOW IT ISN'T BUT I'M GETTING DIFFERENT TO MYSEL' I FEEL I AM
CHANGING
I WADN'T HEED IF T' BAIRNS AND T' WIFE HAD ENOUGH TO LIVE ON
BUT THEY'RE PINCHED THEY'RE PINED
WELL MY LAD AND SO ARE YOU I SEE YOU ARE
THESE ARE GRIEVOUS TIMES
I SEE SUFFERING WHEREVER I TURN
WILLIAM SIT DOWN
GRACE SIT DOWN
LET
US TALK IT OVER
AND IN ORDER THE BETTER TO TALK IT OVER MR
HALL LIFTED THE LEAST OF
THE CHILDREN ON TO HIS KNEE AND PLACED HIS HAND ON THE HEAD OF THE
NEXT LEAST BUT WHEN THE SMALL THINGS BEGAN TO CHATTER TO HIM HE BADE
THEM WHISHT AND FIXING HIS EYES ON THE GRATE HE REGARDED THE HANDFUL
OF EMBERS WHICH BURNED THERE VERY GRAVELY
SAD TIMES HE SAID AND THEY LAST LONG
IT IS THE WILL OF GOD
HIS
WILL BE DONE
BUT HE TRIES US TO THE UTMOST
AGAIN HE REFLECTED
YOU'VE NO MONEY WILLIAM AND YOU'VE NOTHING YOU COULD SELL TO RAISE A
SMALL SUM
NO
I'VE SELLED T' CHEST O' DRAWERS AND T' CLOCK AND T' BIT OF A
MAHOGANY STAND AND T' WIFE'S BONNY TEA TRAY AND SET O' CHEENEY 'AT SHE
BROUGHT FOR A PORTION WHEN WE WERE WED
AND IF SOMEBODY LENT YOU A POUND OR TWO COULD YOU MAKE ANY GOOD USE OF
IT COULD YOU GET INTO A NEW WAY OF DOING SOMETHING
FARREN DID NOT ANSWER BUT HIS WIFE SAID QUICKLY AY I'M SURE HE
COULD SIR
HE'S A VERY CONTRIVING CHAP IS OUR WILLIAM
IF HE'D TWO OR
THREE POUNDS HE COULD BEGIN SELLING STUFF
COULD YOU WILLIAM
PLEASE GOD RETURNED WILLIAM DELIBERATELY I COULD BUY GROCERIES AND
BITS O' TAPES AND THREAD AND WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD SELL AND I COULD
BEGIN HAWKING AT FIRST
AND YOU KNOW SIR INTERPOSED GRACE YOU'RE SURE WILLIAM WOULD
NEITHER DRINK NOR IDLE NOR WASTE IN ANY WAY
HE'S MY HUSBAND AND I
SHOULDN'T PRAISE HIM BUT I WILL SAY THERE'S NOT A SOBERER HONESTER
MAN I' ENGLAND NOR HE IS
WELL I'LL SPEAK TO ONE OR TWO FRIENDS AND I THINK I CAN PROMISE TO
LET HIM HAVE 5 IN A DAY OR TWO AS A LOAN YE MIND NOT A GIFT
HE MUST
PAY IT BACK
I UNDERSTAND SIR
I'M QUITE AGREEABLE TO THAT
MEANTIME THERE'S A FEW SHILLINGS FOR YOU GRACE JUST TO KEEP THE POT
BOILING TILL CUSTOM COMES NOW BAIRNS STAND UP IN A ROW AND SAY YOUR
CATECHISM WHILE YOUR MOTHER GOES AND BUYS SOME DINNER FOR YOU'VE NOT
HAD MUCH TO DAY I'LL BE BOUND YOU BEGIN BEN

MR
HALL STAYED TILL GRACE CAME BACK THEN HE HASTILY TOOK HIS LEAVE
SHAKING HANDS WITH BOTH FARREN AND HIS WIFE
JUST AT THE DOOR HE SAID TO
THEM A FEW BRIEF BUT VERY EARNEST WORDS OF RELIGIOUS CONSOLATION AND
EXHORTATION
WITH A MUTUAL GOD BLESS YOU SIR GOD BLESS YOU MY
FRIENDS THEY SEPARATED
CHAPTER IX
BRIARMAINS
MESSRS
HELSTONE AND SYKES BEGAN TO BE EXTREMELY JOCOSE AND
CONGRATULATORY WITH MR
MOORE WHEN HE RETURNED TO THEM AFTER DISMISSING
THE DEPUTATION
HE WAS SO QUIET HOWEVER UNDER THEIR COMPLIMENTS UPON
HIS FIRMNESS ETC AND WORE A COUNTENANCE SO LIKE A STILL DARK DAY
EQUALLY BEAMLESS AND BREEZELESS THAT THE RECTOR AFTER GLANCING
SHREWDLY INTO HIS EYES BUTTONED UP HIS FELICITATIONS WITH HIS COAT AND
SAID TO SYKES WHOSE SENSES WERE NOT ACUTE ENOUGH TO ENABLE HIM TO
DISCOVER UNASSISTED WHERE HIS PRESENCE AND CONVERSATION WERE A NUISANCE
COME SIR YOUR ROAD AND MINE LIE PARTLY TOGETHER
HAD WE NOT BETTER
BEAR EACH OTHER COMPANY WE'LL BID MOORE GOOD MORNING AND LEAVE HIM TO
THE HAPPY FANCIES HE SEEMS DISPOSED TO INDULGE
AND WHERE IS SUGDEN DEMANDED MOORE LOOKING UP
AH HA CRIED HELSTONE
I'VE NOT BEEN QUITE IDLE WHILE YOU WERE BUSY
I'VE BEEN HELPING YOU A LITTLE I FLATTER MYSELF NOT INJUDICIOUSLY
I
THOUGHT IT BETTER NOT TO LOSE TIME SO WHILE YOU WERE PARLEYING WITH
THAT DOWN LOOKING GENTLEMAN FARREN I THINK HIS NAME IS I OPENED THIS
BACK WINDOW SHOUTED TO MURGATROYD WHO WAS IN THE STABLE TO BRING MR
SYKES'S GIG ROUND THEN I SMUGGLED SUGDEN AND BROTHER MOSES WOODEN LEG
AND ALL THROUGH THE APERTURE AND SAW THEM MOUNT THE GIG ALWAYS WITH
OUR GOOD FRIEND SYKES'S PERMISSION OF COURSE
SUGDEN TOOK THE
REINS HE DRIVES LIKE JEHU AND IN ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR
BARRACLOUGH WILL BE SAFE IN STILBRO' JAIL
VERY GOOD THANK YOU SAID MOORE AND GOOD MORNING GENTLEMEN HE
ADDED AND SO POLITELY CONDUCTED THEM TO THE DOOR AND SAW THEM CLEAR OF
HIS PREMISES
HE WAS A TACITURN SERIOUS MAN THE REST OF THE DAY
HE DID NOT EVEN
BANDY A REPARTEE WITH JOE SCOTT WHO FOR HIS PART SAID TO HIS MASTER
ONLY JUST WHAT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO THE PROGRESS OF BUSINESS
BUT LOOKED AT HIM A GOOD DEAL OUT OF THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES FREQUENTLY
CAME TO POKE THE COUNTING HOUSE FIRE FOR HIM AND ONCE AS HE WAS
LOCKING UP FOR THE DAY THE MILL WAS THEN WORKING SHORT TIME OWING TO
THE SLACKNESS OF TRADE OBSERVED THAT IT WAS A GRAND EVENING AND HE
COULD WISH MR
MOORE TO TAKE A BIT OF A WALK UP TH' HOLLOW
IT WOULD DO
HIM GOOD
AT THIS RECOMMENDATION MR
MOORE BURST INTO A SHORT LAUGH AND AFTER
DEMANDING OF JOE WHAT ALL THIS SOLICITUDE MEANT AND WHETHER HE TOOK HIM
FOR A WOMAN OR A CHILD SEIZED THE KEYS FROM HIS HAND AND SHOVED HIM BY
THE SHOULDERS OUT OF HIS PRESENCE
HE CALLED HIM BACK HOWEVER ERE HE
HAD REACHED THE YARD GATE
JOE DO YOU KNOW THOSE FARRENS THEY ARE NOT WELL OFF I SUPPOSE
THEY CANNOT BE WELL OFF SIR WHEN THEY'VE NOT HAD WORK AS A THREE
MONTH
YE'D SEE YOURSEL' 'AT WILLIAM'S SORELY CHANGED FAIR PAIRED
THEY'VE SELLED MOST O' T' STUFF OUT O' TH' HOUSE
HE WAS NOT A BAD WORKMAN
YE NEVER HAD A BETTER SIR SIN' YE BEGAN TRADE
AND DECENT PEOPLE THE WHOLE FAMILY
NIVER DACENTER
TH' WIFE'S A RAIGHT CANT BODY AND AS CLEAN YE MUGHT
EAT YOUR PORRIDGE OFF TH' HOUSE FLOOR
THEY'RE SORELY COMED DOWN
I WISH
WILLIAM COULD GET A JOB AS GARDENER OR SUMMAT I' THAT WAY HE
UNDERSTANDS GARDENING WEEL
HE ONCE LIVED WI' A SCOTCHMAN THAT TACHED
HIM THE MYSTERIES O' THAT CRAFT AS THEY SAY
NOW THEN YOU CAN GO JOE
YOU NEED NOT STAND THERE STARING AT ME
YE'VE NO ORDERS TO GIVE SIR
NONE BUT FOR YOU TO TAKE YOURSELF OFF
WHICH JOE DID ACCORDINGLY
SPRING EVENINGS ARE OFTEN COLD AND RAW AND THOUGH THIS HAD BEEN A FINE
DAY WARM EVEN IN THE MORNING AND MERIDIAN SUNSHINE THE AIR CHILLED AT
SUNSET THE GROUND CRISPED AND ERE DUSK A HOAR FROST WAS INSIDIOUSLY
STEALING OVER GROWING GRASS AND UNFOLDING BUD
IT WHITENED THE PAVEMENT
IN FRONT OF BRIARMAINS MR
YORKE'S RESIDENCE AND MADE SILENT HAVOC
AMONG THE TENDER PLANTS IN HIS GARDEN AND ON THE MOSSY LEVEL OF HIS
LAWN
AS TO THAT GREAT TREE STRONG TRUNKED AND BROAD ARMED WHICH
GUARDED THE GABLE NEAREST THE ROAD IT SEEMED TO DEFY A SPRING NIGHT
FROST TO HARM ITS STILL BARE BOUGHS AND SO DID THE LEAFLESS GROVE OF
WALNUT TREES RISING TALL BEHIND THE HOUSE
IN THE DUSK OF THE MOONLESS IF STARRY NIGHT LIGHTS FROM WINDOWS SHONE
VIVIDLY
THIS WAS NO DARK OR LONELY SCENE NOR EVEN A SILENT ONE
BRIARMAINS STOOD NEAR THE HIGHWAY
IT WAS RATHER AN OLD PLACE AND HAD
BEEN BUILT ERE THAT HIGHWAY WAS CUT AND WHEN A LANE WINDING UP THROUGH
FIELDS WAS THE ONLY PATH CONDUCTING TO IT
BRIARFIELD LAY SCARCE A MILE
OFF ITS HUM WAS HEARD ITS GLARE DISTINCTLY SEEN
BRIAR CHAPEL A
LARGE NEW RAW WESLEYAN PLACE OF WORSHIP ROSE BUT A HUNDRED YARDS
DISTANT AND AS THERE WAS EVEN NOW A PRAYER MEETING BEING HELD WITHIN
ITS WALLS THE ILLUMINATION OF ITS WINDOWS CAST A BRIGHT REFLECTION ON
THE ROAD WHILE A HYMN OF A MOST EXTRAORDINARY DESCRIPTION SUCH AS A
VERY QUAKER MIGHT FEEL HIMSELF MOVED BY THE SPIRIT TO DANCE TO ROUSED
CHEERILY ALL THE ECHOES OF THE VICINAGE
THE WORDS WERE DISTINCTLY
AUDIBLE BY SNATCHES
HERE IS A QUOTATION OR TWO FROM DIFFERENT STRAINS
FOR THE SINGERS PASSED JAUNTILY FROM HYMN TO HYMN AND FROM TUNE TO TUNE
WITH AN EASE AND BUOYANCY ALL THEIR OWN
OH WHO CAN EXPLAIN
THIS STRUGGLE FOR LIFE
THIS TRAVAIL AND PAIN
THIS TREMBLING AND STRIFE
PLAGUE EARTHQUAKE AND FAMINE
AND TUMULT AND WAR
THE WONDERFUL COMING
OF JESUS DECLARE
FOR EVERY FIGHT
IS DREADFUL AND LOUD
THE WARRIOR'S DELIGHT
IS SLAUGHTER AND BLOOD
HIS FOES OVERTURNING
TILL ALL SHALL EXPIRE
AND THIS IS WITH BURNING
AND FUEL AND FIRE
HERE FOLLOWED AN INTERVAL OF CLAMOROUS PRAYER ACCOMPANIED BY FEARFUL
GROANS
A SHOUT OF I'VE FOUND LIBERTY DOAD O' BILL'S HAS FUN'
LIBERTY RANG FROM THE CHAPEL AND OUT ALL THE ASSEMBLY BROKE AGAIN
WHAT A MERCY IS THIS
WHAT A HEAVEN OF BLISS
HOW UNSPEAKABLY HAPPY AM I
GATHERED INTO THE FOLD
WITH THY PEOPLE ENROLLED
WITH THY PEOPLE TO LIVE AND TO DIE
OH THE GOODNESS OF GOD
IN EMPLOYING A CLOD
HIS TRIBUTE OF GLORY TO RAISE
HIS STANDARD TO BEAR
AND WITH TRIUMPH DECLARE
HIS UNSPEAKABLE RICHES OF GRACE
OH THE FATHOMLESS LOVE
THAT HAS DEIGNED TO APPROVE
AND PROSPER THE WORK OF MY HANDS
WITH MY PASTORAL CROOK
I WENT OVER THE BROOK
AND BEHOLD I AM SPREAD INTO BANDS
WHO I ASK IN AMAZE
HATH BEGOTTEN ME THESE
AND INQUIRE FROM WHAT QUARTER THEY CAME
MY FULL HEART IT REPLIES
THEY ARE BORN FROM THE SKIES
AND GIVES GLORY TO GOD AND THE LAMB
THE STANZA WHICH FOLLOWED THIS AFTER ANOTHER AND LONGER INTERREGNUM OF
SHOUTS YELLS EJACULATIONS FRANTIC CRIES AGONIZED GROANS SEEMED TO
CAP THE CLIMAX OF NOISE AND ZEAL
SLEEPING ON THE BRINK OF SIN
TOPHET GAPED TO TAKE US IN
MERCY TO OUR RESCUE FLEW
BROKE THE SNARE AND BROUGHT US THROUGH
HERE AS IN A LION'S DEN
UNDEVOURED WE STILL REMAIN
PASS SECURE THE WATERY FLOOD
HANGING ON THE ARM OF GOD
HERE
TERRIBLE MOST DISTRACTING TO THE EAR WAS THE STRAINED SHOUT IN WHICH
THE LAST STANZA WAS GIVEN
HERE WE RAISE OUR VOICES HIGHER
SHOUT IN THE REFINER'S FIRE
CLAP OUR HANDS AMIDST THE FLAME
GLORY GIVE TO JESUS' NAME
THE ROOF OF THE CHAPEL DID NOT FLY OFF WHICH SPEAKS VOLUMES IN PRAISE
OF ITS SOLID SLATING
BUT IF BRIAR CHAPEL SEEMED ALIVE SO ALSO DID BRIARMAINS THOUGH
CERTAINLY THE MANSION APPEARED TO ENJOY A QUIETER PHASE OF EXISTENCE
THAN THE TEMPLE
SOME OF ITS WINDOWS TOO WERE AGLOW THE LOWER CASEMENTS
OPENED UPON THE LAWN CURTAINS CONCEALED THE INTERIOR AND PARTLY
OBSCURED THE RAY OF THE CANDLES WHICH LIT IT BUT THEY DID NOT ENTIRELY
MUFFLE THE SOUND OF VOICE AND LAUGHTER
WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO ENTER THAT
FRONT DOOR AND TO PENETRATE TO THE DOMESTIC SANCTUM
IT IS NOT THE PRESENCE OF COMPANY WHICH MAKES MR
YORKE'S HABITATION
LIVELY FOR THERE IS NONE WITHIN IT SAVE HIS OWN FAMILY AND THEY ARE
ASSEMBLED IN THAT FARTHEST ROOM TO THE RIGHT THE BACK PARLOUR
THIS IS THE USUAL SITTING ROOM OF AN EVENING
THOSE WINDOWS WOULD BE
SEEN BY DAYLIGHT TO BE OF BRILLIANTLY STAINED GLASS PURPLE AND AMBER
THE PREDOMINANT HUES GLITTERING ROUND A GRAVELY TINTED MEDALLION IN THE
CENTRE OF EACH REPRESENTING THE SUAVE HEAD OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE AND
THE SERENE ONE OF JOHN MILTON
SOME CANADIAN VIEWS HUNG ON THE
WALLS GREEN FOREST AND BLUE WATER SCENERY AND IN THE MIDST OF THEM
BLAZES A NIGHT ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS VERY ARDENTLY IT GLOWS CONTRASTED
WITH THE COOL FOAM AND AZURE OF CATARACTS AND THE DUSKY DEPTHS OF
WOODS
THE FIRE ILLUMINATING THIS ROOM READER IS SUCH AS IF YOU BE A
SOUTHERN YOU DO NOT OFTEN SEE BURNING ON THE HEARTH OF A PRIVATE
APARTMENT
IT IS A CLEAR HOT COAL FIRE HEAPED HIGH IN THE AMPLE
CHIMNEY
MR
YORKE WILL HAVE SUCH FIRES EVEN IN WARM SUMMER WEATHER
HE SITS BESIDE IT WITH A BOOK IN HIS HAND A LITTLE ROUND STAND AT HIS
ELBOW SUPPORTING A CANDLE BUT HE IS NOT READING HE IS WATCHING HIS
CHILDREN
OPPOSITE TO HIM SITS HIS LADY A PERSONAGE WHOM I MIGHT
DESCRIBE MINUTELY BUT I FEEL NO VOCATION TO THE TASK
I SEE HER
THOUGH VERY PLAINLY BEFORE ME A LARGE WOMAN OF THE GRAVEST ASPECT
CARE ON HER FRONT AND ON HER SHOULDERS BUT NOT OVERWHELMING INEVITABLE
CARE RATHER THE SORT OF VOLUNTARY EXEMPLARY CLOUD AND BURDEN PEOPLE
EVER CARRY WHO DEEM IT THEIR DUTY TO BE GLOOMY
AH WELL A DAY MRS
YORKE HAD THAT NOTION AND GRAVE AS SATURN SHE WAS MORNING NOON AND
NIGHT AND HARD THINGS SHE THOUGHT IF ANY UNHAPPY WIGHT ESPECIALLY OF
THE FEMALE SEX WHO DARED IN HER PRESENCE TO SHOW THE LIGHT OF A GAY
HEART ON A SUNNY COUNTENANCE
IN HER ESTIMATION TO BE MIRTHFUL WAS TO
BE PROFANE TO BE CHEERFUL WAS TO BE FRIVOLOUS
SHE DREW NO
DISTINCTIONS
YET SHE WAS A VERY GOOD WIFE A VERY CAREFUL MOTHER
LOOKED AFTER HER CHILDREN UNCEASINGLY WAS SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HER
HUSBAND ONLY THE WORST OF IT WAS IF SHE COULD HAVE HAD HER WILL SHE
WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO HAVE ANY FRIEND IN THE WORLD BESIDE
HERSELF
ALL HIS RELATIONS WERE INSUPPORTABLE TO HER AND SHE KEPT THEM
AT ARM'S LENGTH
MR
YORKE AND SHE AGREED PERFECTLY WELL YET HE WAS NATURALLY A SOCIAL
HOSPITABLE MAN AN ADVOCATE FOR FAMILY UNITY AND IN HIS YOUTH AS HAS
BEEN SAID HE LIKED NONE BUT LIVELY CHEERFUL WOMEN
WHY HE CHOSE HER
HOW THEY CONTRIVED TO SUIT EACH OTHER IS A PROBLEM PUZZLING ENOUGH BUT
WHICH MIGHT SOON BE SOLVED IF ONE HAD TIME TO GO INTO THE ANALYSIS OF
THE CASE
SUFFICE IT HERE TO SAY THAT YORKE HAD A SHADOWY SIDE AS WELL
AS A SUNNY SIDE TO HIS CHARACTER AND THAT HIS SHADOWY SIDE FOUND
SYMPATHY AND AFFINITY IN THE WHOLE OF HIS WIFE'S UNIFORMLY OVERCAST
NATURE
FOR THE REST SHE WAS A STRONG MINDED WOMAN NEVER SAID A WEAK
OR A TRITE THING TOOK STERN DEMOCRATIC VIEWS OF SOCIETY AND RATHER
CYNICAL ONES OF HUMAN NATURE CONSIDERED HERSELF PERFECT AND SAFE AND
THE REST OF THE WORLD ALL WRONG
HER MAIN FAULT WAS A BROODING ETERNAL
IMMITIGABLE SUSPICION OF ALL MEN THINGS CREEDS AND PARTIES THIS
SUSPICION WAS A MIST BEFORE HER EYES A FALSE GUIDE IN HER PATH
WHEREVER SHE LOOKED WHEREVER SHE TURNED
IT MAY BE SUPPOSED THAT THE CHILDREN OF SUCH A PAIR WERE NOT LIKELY TO
TURN OUT QUITE ORDINARY COMMONPLACE BEINGS AND THEY WERE NOT
YOU SEE
SIX OF THEM READER
THE YOUNGEST IS A BABY ON THE MOTHER'S KNEE
IT IS
ALL HER OWN YET AND THAT ONE SHE HAS NOT YET BEGUN TO DOUBT SUSPECT
CONDEMN IT DERIVES ITS SUSTENANCE FROM HER IT HANGS ON HER IT CLINGS
TO HER IT LOVES HER ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD
SHE IS SURE OF
THAT BECAUSE AS IT LIVES BY HER IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE THEREFORE SHE
LOVES IT
THE TWO NEXT ARE GIRLS ROSE AND JESSY THEY ARE BOTH NOW AT THEIR
FATHER'S KNEE THEY SELDOM GO NEAR THEIR MOTHER EXCEPT WHEN OBLIGED TO
DO SO
ROSE THE ELDER IS TWELVE YEARS OLD SHE IS LIKE HER FATHER THE
MOST LIKE HIM OF THE WHOLE GROUP BUT IT IS A GRANITE HEAD COPIED IN
IVORY ALL IS SOFTENED IN COLOUR AND LINE
YORKE HIMSELF HAS A HARSH
FACE HIS DAUGHTER'S IS NOT HARSH NEITHER IS IT QUITE PRETTY IT IS
SIMPLE CHILDLIKE IN FEATURE THE ROUND CHEEKS BLOOM AS TO THE GRAY
EYES THEY ARE OTHERWISE THAN CHILDLIKE A SERIOUS SOUL LIGHTS THEM A
YOUNG SOUL YET BUT IT WILL MATURE IF THE BODY LIVES AND NEITHER
FATHER NOR MOTHER HAVE A SPIRIT TO COMPARE WITH IT
PARTAKING OF THE
ESSENCE OF EACH IT WILL ONE DAY BE BETTER THAN EITHER STRONGER MUCH
PURER MORE ASPIRING
ROSE IS A STILL SOMETIMES A STUBBORN GIRL NOW
HER MOTHER WANTS TO MAKE OF HER SUCH A WOMAN AS SHE IS HERSELF A WOMAN
OF DARK AND DREARY DUTIES AND ROSE HAS A MIND FULL SET THICK SOWN WITH
THE GERMS OF IDEAS HER MOTHER NEVER KNEW
IT IS AGONY TO HER OFTEN TO
HAVE THESE IDEAS TRAMPLED ON AND REPRESSED
SHE HAS NEVER REBELLED YET
BUT IF HARD DRIVEN SHE WILL REBEL ONE DAY AND THEN IT WILL BE ONCE FOR
ALL
ROSE LOVES HER FATHER HER FATHER DOES NOT RULE HER WITH A ROD OF
IRON HE IS GOOD TO HER
HE SOMETIMES FEARS SHE WILL NOT LIVE SO BRIGHT
ARE THE SPARKS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH AT MOMENTS FLASH FROM HER GLANCE
AND GLEAM IN HER LANGUAGE
THIS IDEA MAKES HIM OFTEN SADLY TENDER TO
HER
HE HAS NO IDEA THAT LITTLE JESSY WILL DIE YOUNG SHE IS SO GAY AND
CHATTERING ARCH ORIGINAL EVEN NOW PASSIONATE WHEN PROVOKED BUT MOST
AFFECTIONATE IF CARESSED BY TURNS GENTLE AND RATTLING EXACTING YET
GENEROUS FEARLESS OF HER MOTHER FOR INSTANCE WHOSE IRRATIONALLY HARD
AND STRICT RULE SHE HAS OFTEN DEFIED YET RELIANT ON ANY WHO WILL HELP
HER
JESSY WITH HER LITTLE PIQUANT FACE ENGAGING PRATTLE AND WINNING
WAYS IS MADE TO BE A PET AND HER FATHER'S PET SHE ACCORDINGLY IS
IT
IS ODD THAT THE DOLL SHOULD RESEMBLE HER MOTHER FEATURE BY FEATURE AS
ROSE RESEMBLES HER FATHER AND YET THE PHYSIOGNOMY HOW DIFFERENT
MR
YORKE IF A MAGIC MIRROR WERE NOW HELD BEFORE YOU AND IF THEREIN
WERE SHOWN YOU YOUR TWO DAUGHTERS AS THEY WILL BE TWENTY YEARS FROM THIS
NIGHT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK THE MAGIC MIRROR IS HERE YOU SHALL LEARN
THEIR DESTINIES AND FIRST THAT OF YOUR LITTLE LIFE JESSY
DO YOU KNOW THIS PLACE NO YOU NEVER SAW IT BUT YOU RECOGNIZE THE
NATURE OF THESE TREES THIS FOLIAGE THE CYPRESS THE WILLOW THE YEW
STONE CROSSES LIKE THESE ARE NOT UNFAMILIAR TO YOU NOR ARE THESE DIM
GARLANDS OF EVERLASTING FLOWERS
HERE IS THE PLACE GREEN SOD AND A GRAY
MARBLE HEADSTONE
JESSY SLEEPS BELOW
SHE LIVED THROUGH AN APRIL DAY
MUCH LOVED WAS SHE MUCH LOVING
SHE OFTEN IN HER BRIEF LIFE SHED
TEARS SHE HAD FREQUENT SORROWS SHE SMILED BETWEEN GLADDENING WHATEVER
SAW HER
HER DEATH WAS TRANQUIL AND HAPPY IN ROSE'S GUARDIAN ARMS FOR
ROSE HAD BEEN HER STAY AND DEFENCE THROUGH MANY TRIALS
THE DYING AND
THE WATCHING ENGLISH GIRLS WERE AT THAT HOUR ALONE IN A FOREIGN
COUNTRY AND THE SOIL OF THAT COUNTRY GAVE JESSY A GRAVE
NOW BEHOLD ROSE TWO YEARS LATER
THE CROSSES AND GARLANDS LOOKED
STRANGE BUT THE HILLS AND WOODS OF THIS LANDSCAPE LOOK STILL STRANGER
THIS INDEED IS FAR FROM ENGLAND REMOTE MUST BE THE SHORES WHICH WEAR
THAT WILD LUXURIANT ASPECT
THIS IS SOME VIRGIN SOLITUDE
UNKNOWN BIRDS
FLUTTER ROUND THE SKIRTS OF THAT FOREST NO EUROPEAN RIVER THIS ON
WHOSE BANKS ROSE SITS THINKING
THE LITTLE QUIET YORKSHIRE GIRL IS A
LONELY EMIGRANT IN SOME REGION OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
WILL SHE EVER
COME BACK
THE THREE ELDEST OF THE FAMILY ARE ALL BOYS MATTHEW MARK AND MARTIN
THEY ARE SEATED TOGETHER IN THAT CORNER ENGAGED IN SOME GAME
OBSERVE
THEIR THREE HEADS MUCH ALIKE AT A FIRST GLANCE AT A SECOND DIFFERENT
AT A THIRD CONTRASTED
DARK HAIRED DARK EYED RED CHEEKED ARE THE
WHOLE TRIO SMALL ENGLISH FEATURES THEY ALL POSSESS ALL OWN A BLENDED
RESEMBLANCE TO SIRE AND MOTHER AND YET A DISTINCTIVE PHYSIOGNOMY MARK
OF A SEPARATE CHARACTER BELONGS TO EACH
I SHALL NOT SAY MUCH ABOUT MATTHEW THE FIRST BORN OF THE HOUSE THOUGH
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID GAZING AT HIM LONG AND CONJECTURING WHAT
QUALITIES THAT VISAGE HIDES OR INDICATES
HE IS NO PLAIN LOOKING BOY
THAT JET BLACK HAIR WHITE BROW HIGH COLOURED CHEEK THOSE QUICK DARK
EYES ARE GOOD POINTS IN THEIR WAY
HOW IS IT THAT LOOK AS LONG AS YOU
WILL THERE IS BUT ONE OBJECT IN THE ROOM AND THAT THE MOST SINISTER
TO WHICH MATTHEW'S FACE SEEMS TO BEAR AN AFFINITY AND OF WHICH EVER
AND ANON IT REMINDS YOU STRANGELY THE ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS FLAME AND
SHADOW SEEM THE COMPONENT PARTS OF THAT LAD'S SOUL NO DAYLIGHT IN IT
AND NO SUNSHINE AND NO PURE COOL MOONBEAM EVER SHONE THERE
HE HAS AN
ENGLISH FRAME BUT APPARENTLY NOT AN ENGLISH MIND YOU WOULD SAY AN
ITALIAN STILETTO IN A SHEATH OF BRITISH WORKMANSHIP
HE IS CROSSED IN
THE GAME LOOK AT HIS SCOWL
MR
YORKE SEES IT AND WHAT DOES HE SAY IN
A LOW VOICE HE PLEADS MARK AND MARTIN DON'T ANGER YOUR BROTHER AND
THIS IS EVER THE TONE ADOPTED BY BOTH PARENTS
THEORETICALLY THEY DECRY
PARTIALITY NO RIGHTS OF PRIMOGENITURE ARE TO BE ALLOWED IN THAT HOUSE
BUT MATTHEW IS NEVER TO BE VEXED NEVER TO BE OPPOSED THEY AVERT
PROVOCATION FROM HIM AS ASSIDUOUSLY AS THEY WOULD AVERT FIRE FROM A
BARREL OF GUNPOWDER
CONCEDE CONCILIATE IS THEIR MOTTO WHEREVER HE
IS CONCERNED
THE REPUBLICANS ARE FAST MAKING A TYRANT OF THEIR OWN
FLESH AND BLOOD
THIS THE YOUNGER SCIONS KNOW AND FEEL AND AT HEART
THEY ALL REBEL AGAINST THE INJUSTICE
THEY CANNOT READ THEIR PARENTS'
MOTIVES THEY ONLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE OF TREATMENT
THE DRAGON'S TEETH
ARE ALREADY SOWN AMONGST MR
YORKE'S YOUNG OLIVE BRANCHES DISCORD WILL
ONE DAY BE THE HARVEST
MARK IS A BONNY LOOKING BOY THE MOST REGULAR FEATURED OF THE FAMILY
HE
IS EXCEEDINGLY CALM HIS SMILE IS SHREWD HE CAN SAY THE DRIEST MOST
CUTTING THINGS IN THE QUIETEST OF TONES
DESPITE HIS TRANQUILLITY A
SOMEWHAT HEAVY BROW SPEAKS TEMPER AND REMINDS YOU THAT THE SMOOTHEST
WATERS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAFEST
BESIDES HE IS TOO STILL UNMOVED
PHLEGMATIC TO BE HAPPY
LIFE WILL NEVER HAVE MUCH JOY IN IT FOR MARK
BY THE TIME HE IS FIVE AND TWENTY HE WILL WONDER WHY PEOPLE EVER LAUGH
AND THINK ALL FOOLS WHO SEEM MERRY
POETRY WILL NOT EXIST FOR MARK
EITHER IN LITERATURE OR IN LIFE ITS BEST EFFUSIONS WILL SOUND TO HIM
MERE RANT AND JARGON
ENTHUSIASM WILL BE HIS AVERSION AND CONTEMPT
MARK
WILL HAVE NO YOUTH WHILE HE LOOKS JUVENILE AND BLOOMING HE WILL BE
ALREADY MIDDLE AGED IN MIND
HIS BODY IS NOW FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE BUT
HIS SOUL IS ALREADY THIRTY
MARTIN THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE OWNS ANOTHER NATURE
LIFE MAY OR MAY
NOT BE BRIEF FOR HIM BUT IT WILL CERTAINLY BE BRILLIANT
HE WILL PASS
THROUGH ALL ITS ILLUSIONS HALF BELIEVE IN THEM WHOLLY ENJOY THEM THEN
OUTLIVE THEM
THAT BOY IS NOT HANDSOME NOT SO HANDSOME AS EITHER OF HIS
BROTHERS
HE IS PLAIN THERE IS A HUSK UPON HIM A DRY SHELL AND HE
WILL WEAR IT TILL HE IS NEAR TWENTY THEN HE WILL PUT IT OFF
ABOUT THAT
PERIOD HE WILL MAKE HIMSELF HANDSOME
HE WILL WEAR UNCOUTH MANNERS TILL
THAT AGE PERHAPS HOMELY GARMENTS BUT THE CHRYSALIS WILL RETAIN THE
POWER OF TRANSFIGURING ITSELF INTO THE BUTTERFLY AND SUCH
TRANSFIGURATION WILL IN DUE SEASON TAKE PLACE
FOR A SPACE HE WILL BE
VAIN PROBABLY A DOWNRIGHT PUPPY EAGER FOR PLEASURE AND DESIROUS OF
ADMIRATION ATHIRST TOO FOR KNOWLEDGE
HE WILL WANT ALL THAT THE WORLD
CAN GIVE HIM BOTH OF ENJOYMENT AND LORE HE WILL PERHAPS TAKE DEEP
DRAUGHTS AT EACH FOUNT
THAT THIRST SATISFIED WHAT NEXT I KNOW NOT
MARTIN MIGHT BE A REMARKABLE MAN
WHETHER HE WILL OR NOT THE SEER IS
POWERLESS TO PREDICT ON THAT SUBJECT THERE HAS BEEN NO OPEN VISION
TAKE MR
YORKE'S FAMILY IN THE AGGREGATE THERE IS AS MUCH MENTAL POWER
IN THOSE SIX YOUNG HEADS AS MUCH ORIGINALITY AS MUCH ACTIVITY AND
VIGOUR OF BRAIN AS DIVIDED AMONGST HALF A DOZEN COMMONPLACE
BROODS WOULD GIVE TO EACH RATHER MORE THAN AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF SENSE
AND CAPACITY
MR
YORKE KNOWS THIS AND IS PROUD OF HIS RACE
YORKSHIRE
HAS SUCH FAMILIES HERE AND THERE AMONGST HER HILLS AND WOLDS PECULIAR
RACY VIGOROUS OF GOOD BLOOD AND STRONG BRAIN TURBULENT SOMEWHAT IN
THE PRIDE OF THEIR STRENGTH AND INTRACTABLE IN THE FORCE OF THEIR
NATIVE POWERS WANTING POLISH WANTING CONSIDERATION WANTING DOCILITY
BUT SOUND SPIRITED AND TRUE BRED AS THE EAGLE ON THE CLIFF OR THE
STEED IN THE STEPPE
A LOW TAP IS HEARD AT THE PARLOUR DOOR THE BOYS HAVE BEEN MAKING SUCH A
NOISE OVER THEIR GAME AND LITTLE JESSY BESIDES HAS BEEN SINGING SO
SWEET A SCOTCH SONG TO HER FATHER WHO DELIGHTS IN SCOTCH AND ITALIAN
SONGS AND HAS TAUGHT HIS MUSICAL LITTLE DAUGHTER SOME OF THE BEST THAT
THE RING AT THE OUTER DOOR WAS NOT OBSERVED
COME IN SAYS MRS
YORKE IN THAT CONSCIENTIOUSLY CONSTRAINED AND
SOLEMNIZED VOICE OF HERS WHICH EVER MODULATES ITSELF TO A FUNEREAL
DREARINESS OF TONE THOUGH THE SUBJECT IT IS EXERCISED UPON BE BUT TO
GIVE ORDERS FOR THE MAKING OF A PUDDING IN THE KITCHEN TO BID THE BOYS
HANG UP THEIR CAPS IN THE HALL OR TO CALL THE GIRLS TO THEIR
SEWING COME IN AND IN CAME ROBERT MOORE
MOORE'S HABITUAL GRAVITY AS WELL AS HIS ABSTEMIOUSNESS FOR THE CASE OF
SPIRIT DECANTERS IS NEVER ORDERED UP WHEN HE PAYS AN EVENING VISIT HAS
SO FAR RECOMMENDED HIM TO MRS
YORKE THAT SHE HAS NOT YET MADE HIM THE
SUBJECT OF PRIVATE ANIMADVERSIONS WITH HER HUSBAND SHE HAS NOT YET
FOUND OUT THAT HE IS HAMPERED BY A SECRET INTRIGUE WHICH PREVENTS HIM
FROM MARRYING OR THAT HE IS A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING DISCOVERIES
WHICH SHE MADE AT AN EARLY DATE AFTER MARRIAGE CONCERNING MOST OF HER
HUSBAND'S BACHELOR FRIENDS AND EXCLUDED THEM FROM HER BOARD
ACCORDINGLY WHICH PART OF HER CONDUCT INDEED MIGHT BE SAID TO HAVE
ITS JUST AND SENSIBLE AS WELL AS ITS HARSH SIDE
WELL IS IT YOU SHE SAYS TO MR
MOORE AS HE COMES UP TO HER AND
GIVES HIS HAND
WHAT ARE YOU ROVING ABOUT AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT FOR
YOU SHOULD BE AT HOME
CAN A SINGLE MAN BE SAID TO HAVE A HOME MADAM HE ASKS
POOH SAYS MRS
YORKE WHO DESPISES CONVENTIONAL SMOOTHNESS QUITE AS
MUCH AS HER HUSBAND DOES AND PRACTISES IT AS LITTLE AND WHOSE PLAIN
SPEAKING ON ALL OCCASIONS IS CARRIED TO A POINT CALCULATED SOMETIMES
TO AWAKEN ADMIRATION BUT OFTENER ALARM POOH YOU NEED NOT TALK
NONSENSE TO ME A SINGLE MAN CAN HAVE A HOME IF HE LIKES
PRAY DOES NOT
YOUR SISTER MAKE A HOME FOR YOU
NOT SHE JOINED IN MR
YORKE
HORTENSE IS AN HONEST LASS
BUT WHEN I
WAS ROBERT'S AGE I HAD FIVE OR SIX SISTERS ALL AS DECENT AND PROPER AS
SHE IS BUT YOU SEE HESTHER FOR ALL THAT IT DID NOT HINDER ME FROM
LOOKING OUT FOR A WIFE
AND SORELY HE HAS REPENTED MARRYING ME ADDED MRS
YORKE WHO LIKED
OCCASIONALLY TO CRACK A DRY JEST AGAINST MATRIMONY EVEN THOUGH IT
SHOULD BE AT HER OWN EXPENSE
HE HAS REPENTED IT IN SACKCLOTH AND
ASHES ROBERT MOORE AS YOU MAY WELL BELIEVE WHEN YOU SEE HIS
PUNISHMENT HERE SHE POINTED TO HER CHILDREN
WHO WOULD BURDEN
THEMSELVES WITH SUCH A SET OF GREAT ROUGH LADS AS THOSE IF THEY COULD
HELP IT IT IS NOT ONLY BRINGING THEM INTO THE WORLD THOUGH THAT IS BAD
ENOUGH BUT THEY ARE ALL TO FEED TO CLOTHE TO REAR TO SETTLE IN LIFE
YOUNG SIR WHEN YOU FEEL TEMPTED TO MARRY THINK OF OUR FOUR SONS AND
TWO DAUGHTERS AND LOOK TWICE BEFORE YOU LEAP
I AM NOT TEMPTED NOW AT ANY RATE
I THINK THESE ARE NOT TIMES FOR
MARRYING OR GIVING IN MARRIAGE
A LUGUBRIOUS SENTIMENT OF THIS SORT WAS SURE TO OBTAIN MRS
YORKE'S
APPROBATION
SHE NODDED AND GROANED ACQUIESCENCE BUT IN A MINUTE SHE
SAID I MAKE LITTLE ACCOUNT OF THE WISDOM OF A SOLOMON OF YOUR AGE IT
WILL BE UPSET BY THE FIRST FANCY THAT CROSSES YOU
MEANTIME SIT DOWN
SIR
YOU CAN TALK I SUPPOSE AS WELL SITTING AS STANDING
THIS WAS HER WAY OF INVITING HER GUEST TO TAKE A CHAIR
HE HAD NO SOONER
OBEYED HER THAN LITTLE JESSY JUMPED FROM HER FATHER'S KNEE AND RAN INTO
MR
MOORE'S ARMS WHICH WERE VERY PROMPTLY HELD OUT TO RECEIVE HER
YOU TALK OF MARRYING HIM SAID SHE TO HER MOTHER QUITE INDIGNANTLY
AS SHE WAS LIFTED LIGHTLY TO HIS KNEE AND HE IS MARRIED NOW OR AS
GOOD
HE PROMISED THAT I SHOULD BE HIS WIFE LAST SUMMER THE FIRST TIME
HE SAW ME IN MY NEW WHITE FROCK AND BLUE SASH
DIDN'T HE FATHER
THESE CHILDREN WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SAY PAPA AND MAMMA THEIR MOTHER
WOULD ALLOW NO SUCH NAMBY PAMBY
AY MY LITTLE LASSIE HE PROMISED I'LL BEAR WITNESS
BUT MAKE HIM SAY
IT OVER AGAIN NOW JESSY
SUCH AS HE ARE ONLY FALSE LOONS
HE IS NOT FALSE
HE IS TOO BONNY TO BE FALSE SAID JESSY LOOKING UP
TO HER TALL SWEETHEART WITH THE FULLEST CONFIDENCE IN HIS FAITH
BONNY CRIED MR
YORKE
THAT'S THE REASON THAT HE SHOULD BE AND
PROOF THAT HE IS A SCOUNDREL
BUT HE LOOKS TOO SORROWFUL TO BE FALSE HERE INTERPOSED A QUIET VOICE
FROM BEHIND THE FATHER'S CHAIR
IF HE WAS ALWAYS LAUGHING I SHOULD
THINK HE FORGOT PROMISES SOON BUT MR
MOORE NEVER LAUGHS
YOUR SENTIMENTAL BUCK IS THE GREATEST CHEAT OF ALL ROSE REMARKED MR
YORKE
HE'S NOT SENTIMENTAL SAID ROSE
MR
MOORE TURNED TO HER WITH A LITTLE SURPRISE SMILING AT THE SAME
TIME
HOW DO YOU KNOW I AM NOT SENTIMENTAL ROSE
BECAUSE I HEARD A LADY SAY YOU WERE NOT
VOIL QUI DEVIENT INTRESSANT EXCLAIMED MR
YORKE HITCHING HIS
CHAIR NEARER THE FIRE
A LADY THAT HAS QUITE A ROMANTIC TWANG
WE MUST
GUESS WHO IT IS ROSY WHISPER THE NAME LOW TO YOUR FATHER
DON'T LET
HIM HEAR
ROSE DON'T BE TOO FORWARD TO TALK HERE INTERRUPTED MRS
YORKE IN
HER USUAL KILL JOY FASHION NOR JESSY EITHER
IT BECOMES ALL CHILDREN
ESPECIALLY GIRLS TO BE SILENT IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR ELDERS
WHY HAVE WE TONGUES THEN ASKED JESSY PERTLY WHILE ROSE ONLY LOOKED
AT HER MOTHER WITH AN EXPRESSION THAT SEEMED TO SAY SHE SHOULD TAKE THAT
MAXIM IN AND THINK IT OVER AT HER LEISURE
AFTER TWO MINUTES' GRAVE
DELIBERATION SHE ASKED AND WHY ESPECIALLY GIRLS MOTHER
FIRSTLY BECAUSE I SAY SO AND SECONDLY BECAUSE DISCRETION AND RESERVE
ARE A GIRL'S BEST WISDOM
MY DEAR MADAM OBSERVED MOORE WHAT YOU SAY IS EXCELLENT IT REMINDS
ME INDEED OF MY DEAR SISTER'S OBSERVATIONS BUT REALLY IT IS NOT
APPLICABLE TO THESE LITTLE ONES
LET ROSE AND JESSY TALK TO ME FREELY
OR MY CHIEF PLEASURE IN COMING HERE IS GONE
I LIKE THEIR PRATTLE IT
DOES ME GOOD
DOES IT NOT ASKED JESSY
MORE GOOD THAN IF THE ROUGH LADS CAME ROUND
YOU YOU CALL THEM ROUGH MOTHER YOURSELF
YES MIGNONNE A THOUSAND TIMES MORE GOOD
I HAVE ROUGH LADS ENOUGH
ABOUT ME ALL DAY LONG POULET
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE CONTINUED SHE WHO TAKE NOTICE OF THE
BOYS
ALL MY UNCLES AND AUNTS SEEM TO THINK THEIR NEPHEWS BETTER THAN
THEIR NIECES AND WHEN GENTLEMEN COME HERE TO DINE IT IS ALWAYS
MATTHEW AND MARK AND MARTIN THAT ARE TALKED TO AND NEVER ROSE AND ME
MR
MOORE IS OUR FRIEND AND WE'LL KEEP HIM BUT MIND ROSE HE'S NOT
SO MUCH YOUR FRIEND AS HE IS MINE
HE IS MY PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCE
REMEMBER THAT AND SHE HELD UP HER SMALL HAND WITH AN ADMONITORY
GESTURE
ROSE WAS QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO BE ADMONISHED BY THAT SMALL HAND
HER WILL
DAILY BENT ITSELF TO THAT OF THE IMPETUOUS LITTLE JESSY
SHE WAS GUIDED
OVERRULED BY JESSY IN A THOUSAND THINGS
ON ALL OCCASIONS OF SHOW AND
PLEASURE JESSY TOOK THE LEAD AND ROSE FELL QUIETLY INTO THE BACKGROUND
WHEREAS WHEN THE DISAGREEABLES OF LIFE ITS WORK AND PRIVATIONS WERE
IN QUESTION ROSE INSTINCTIVELY TOOK UPON HER IN ADDITION TO HER OWN
SHARE WHAT SHE COULD OF HER SISTER'S
JESSY HAD ALREADY SETTLED IT IN
HER MIND THAT SHE WHEN SHE WAS OLD ENOUGH WAS TO BE MARRIED ROSE SHE
DECIDED MUST BE AN OLD MAID TO LIVE WITH HER LOOK AFTER HER CHILDREN
KEEP HER HOUSE
THIS STATE OF THINGS IS NOT UNCOMMON BETWEEN TWO
SISTERS WHERE ONE IS PLAIN AND THE OTHER PRETTY BUT IN THIS CASE IF
THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN EXTERNAL APPEARANCE ROSE HAD THE ADVANTAGE
HER FACE WAS MORE REGULAR FEATURED THAN THAT OF THE PIQUANT LITTLE
JESSY
JESSY HOWEVER WAS DESTINED TO POSSESS ALONG WITH SPRIGHTLY
INTELLIGENCE AND VIVACIOUS FEELING THE GIFT OF FASCINATION THE POWER
TO CHARM WHEN WHERE AND WHOM SHE WOULD
ROSE WAS TO HAVE A FINE
GENEROUS SOUL A NOBLE INTELLECT PROFOUNDLY CULTIVATED A HEART AS TRUE
AS STEEL BUT THE MANNER TO ATTRACT WAS NOT TO BE HERS
NOW ROSE TELL ME THE NAME OF THIS LADY WHO DENIED THAT I WAS
SENTIMENTAL URGED MR
MOORE
ROSE HAD NO IDEA OF TANTALIZATION OR SHE WOULD HAVE HELD HIM A WHILE IN
DOUBT
SHE ANSWERED BRIEFLY I CAN'T
I DON'T KNOW HER NAME
DESCRIBE HER TO ME
WHAT WAS SHE LIKE WHERE DID YOU SEE HER
WHEN JESSY AND I WENT TO SPEND THE DAY AT WHINBURY WITH KATE AND SUSAN
PEARSON WHO WERE JUST COME HOME FROM SCHOOL THERE WAS A PARTY AT MRS
PEARSON'S AND SOME GROWN UP LADIES WERE SITTING IN A CORNER OF THE
DRAWING ROOM TALKING ABOUT YOU
DID YOU KNOW NONE OF THEM
HANNAH AND HARRIET AND DORA AND MARY SYKES
GOOD
WERE THEY ABUSING ME ROSY
SOME OF THEM WERE
THEY CALLED YOU A MISANTHROPE
I REMEMBER THE WORD
I LOOKED FOR IT IN THE DICTIONARY WHEN I CAME HOME
IT MEANS A
MAN HATER
WHAT BESIDES
HANNAH SYKES SAID YOU WERE A SOLEMN PUPPY
BETTER CRIED MR
YORKE LAUGHING
OH EXCELLENT HANNAH THAT'S THE
ONE WITH THE RED HAIR A FINE GIRL BUT HALF WITTED
SHE HAS WIT ENOUGH FOR ME IT APPEARS SAID MOORE
A SOLEMN PUPPY
INDEED WELL ROSE GO ON
MISS PEARSON SAID SHE BELIEVED THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF AFFECTATION
ABOUT YOU AND THAT WITH YOUR DARK HAIR AND PALE FACE YOU LOOKED TO HER
LIKE SOME SORT OF A SENTIMENTAL NOODLE
AGAIN MR
YORKE LAUGHED
MRS
YORKE EVEN JOINED IN THIS TIME
YOU SEE
IN WHAT ESTEEM YOU ARE HELD BEHIND YOUR BACK SAID SHE YET I BELIEVE
THAT MISS PEARSON WOULD LIKE TO CATCH YOU
SHE SET HER CAP AT YOU WHEN
YOU FIRST CAME INTO THE COUNTRY OLD AS SHE IS
AND WHO CONTRADICTED HER ROSY INQUIRED MOORE
A LADY WHOM I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE SHE NEVER VISITS HERE THOUGH I SEE
HER EVERY SUNDAY AT CHURCH
SHE SITS IN THE PEW NEAR THE PULPIT
I
GENERALLY LOOK AT HER INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT MY PRAYER BOOK FOR SHE IS
LIKE A PICTURE IN OUR DINING ROOM THAT WOMAN WITH THE DOVE IN HER
HAND AT LEAST SHE HAS EYES LIKE IT AND A NOSE TOO A STRAIGHT NOSE
THAT MAKES ALL HER FACE LOOK SOMEHOW WHAT I CALL CLEAR
AND YOU DON'T KNOW HER EXCLAIMED JESSY IN A TONE OF EXCEEDING
SURPRISE
THAT'S SO LIKE ROSE
MR
MOORE I OFTEN WONDER IN WHAT SORT
OF A WORLD MY SISTER LIVES
I AM SURE SHE DOES NOT LIVE ALL HER TIME IN
THIS
ONE IS CONTINUALLY FINDING OUT THAT SHE IS QUITE IGNORANT OF SOME
LITTLE MATTER WHICH EVERYBODY ELSE KNOWS
TO THINK OF HER GOING SOLEMNLY
TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY AND LOOKING ALL SERVICE TIME AT ONE PARTICULAR
PERSON AND NEVER SO MUCH AS ASKING THAT PERSON'S NAME
SHE MEANS
CAROLINE HELSTONE THE RECTOR'S NIECE
I REMEMBER ALL ABOUT IT
MISS
HELSTONE WAS QUITE ANGRY WITH ANNE PEARSON
SHE SAID 'ROBERT MOORE IS
NEITHER AFFECTED NOR SENTIMENTAL YOU MISTAKE HIS CHARACTER UTTERLY OR
RATHER NOT ONE OF YOU HERE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW SHALL I TELL
YOU WHAT SHE IS LIKE I CAN TELL WHAT PEOPLE ARE LIKE AND HOW THEY ARE
DRESSED BETTER THAN ROSE CAN
LET US HEAR
SHE IS NICE SHE IS FAIR SHE HAS A PRETTY WHITE SLENDER THROAT SHE
HAS LONG CURLS NOT STIFF ONES THEY HANG LOOSE AND SOFT THEIR COLOUR
IS BROWN BUT NOT DARK SHE SPEAKS QUIETLY WITH A CLEAR TONE SHE NEVER
MAKES A BUSTLE IN MOVING SHE OFTEN WEARS A GRAY SILK DRESS SHE IS NEAT
ALL OVER HER GOWNS AND HER SHOES AND HER GLOVES ALWAYS FIT HER
SHE
IS WHAT I CALL A LADY AND WHEN I AM AS TALL AS SHE IS I MEAN TO BE
LIKE HER
SHALL I SUIT YOU IF I AM WILL YOU REALLY MARRY ME
MOORE STROKED JESSY'S HAIR
FOR A MINUTE HE SEEMED AS IF HE WOULD DRAW
HER NEARER TO HIM BUT INSTEAD HE PUT HER A LITTLE FARTHER OFF
OH YOU WON'T HAVE ME YOU PUSH ME AWAY
WHY JESSY YOU CARE NOTHING ABOUT ME
YOU NEVER COME TO SEE ME NOW AT
THE HOLLOW
BECAUSE YOU DON'T ASK ME
HEREUPON MR
MOORE GAVE BOTH THE LITTLE GIRLS AN INVITATION TO PAY HIM A
VISIT NEXT DAY PROMISING THAT AS HE WAS GOING TO STILBRO' IN THE
MORNING HE WOULD BUY THEM EACH A PRESENT OF WHAT NATURE HE WOULD NOT
THEN DECLARE BUT THEY MUST COME AND SEE
JESSY WAS ABOUT TO REPLY WHEN
ONE OF THE BOYS UNEXPECTEDLY BROKE IN
I KNOW THAT MISS HELSTONE YOU HAVE ALL BEEN PALAVERING ABOUT
SHE'S AN
UGLY GIRL
I HATE HER
I HATE ALL WOMENITES
I WONDER WHAT THEY WERE
MADE FOR
MARTIN SAID HIS FATHER FOR MARTIN IT WAS
THE LAD ONLY ANSWERED BY
TURNING HIS CYNICAL YOUNG FACE HALF ARCH HALF TRUCULENT TOWARDS THE
PATERNAL CHAIR
MARTIN MY LAD THOU'RT A SWAGGERING WHELP NOW THOU
WILT SOME DAY BE AN OUTRAGEOUS PUPPY
BUT STICK TO THOSE SENTIMENTS OF
THINE
SEE I'LL WRITE DOWN THE WORDS NOW I' MY POCKET BOOK THE
SENIOR TOOK OUT A MOROCCO COVERED BOOK AND DELIBERATELY WROTE THEREIN
TEN YEARS HENCE MARTIN IF THOU AND I BE BOTH ALIVE AT THAT DAY I'LL
REMIND THEE OF THAT SPEECH
I'LL SAY THE SAME THEN
I MEAN ALWAYS TO HATE WOMEN
THEY'RE SUCH
DOLLS THEY DO NOTHING BUT DRESS THEMSELVES FINELY AND GO SWIMMING
ABOUT TO BE ADMIRED
I'LL NEVER MARRY
I'LL BE A BACHELOR
STICK TO IT STICK TO IT HESTHER ADDRESSING HIS WIFE I WAS LIKE
HIM WHEN I WAS HIS AGE A REGULAR MISOGAMIST AND BEHOLD BY THE TIME I
WAS THREE AND TWENTY BEING THEN A TOURIST IN FRANCE AND ITALY AND THE
LORD KNOWS WHERE I CURLED MY HAIR EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I WENT TO BED AND
WORE A RING I' MY EAR AND WOULD HAVE WORN ONE I' MY NOSE IF IT HAD BEEN
THE FASHION AND ALL THAT I MIGHT MAKE MYSELF PLEASING AND CHARMING TO
THE LADIES
MARTIN WILL DO THE LIKE
WILL I NEVER I'VE MORE SENSE
WHAT A GUY YOU WERE FATHER AS TO
DRESSING I MAKE THIS VOW I'LL NEVER DRESS MORE FINELY THAN AS YOU SEE
ME AT PRESENT MR
MOORE I'M CLAD IN BLUE CLOTH FROM TOP TO TOE AND
THEY LAUGH AT ME AND CALL ME SAILOR AT THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL
I LAUGH
LOUDER AT THEM AND SAY THEY ARE ALL MAGPIES AND PARROTS WITH THEIR
COATS ONE COLOUR AND THEIR WAISTCOATS ANOTHER AND THEIR TROUSERS A
THIRD
I'LL ALWAYS WEAR BLUE CLOTH AND NOTHING BUT BLUE CLOTH
IT IS
BENEATH A HUMAN BEING'S DIGNITY TO DRESS HIMSELF IN PARTI COLOURED
GARMENTS
TEN YEARS HENCE MARTIN NO TAILOR'S SHOP WILL HAVE CHOICE OF COLOURS
VARIED ENOUGH FOR THY EXACTING TASTE NO PERFUMER'S STORES ESSENCES
EXQUISITE ENOUGH FOR THY FASTIDIOUS SENSES
MARTIN LOOKED DISDAIN BUT VOUCHSAFED NO FURTHER REPLY
MEANTIME MARK
WHO FOR SOME MINUTES HAD BEEN RUMMAGING AMONGST A PILE OF BOOKS ON A
SIDE TABLE TOOK THE WORD
HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SLOW QUIET VOICE
AND WITH AN EXPRESSION OF STILL IRONY IN HIS FACE NOT EASY TO DESCRIBE
MR
MOORE SAID HE YOU THINK PERHAPS IT WAS A COMPLIMENT ON MISS
CAROLINE HELSTONE'S PART TO SAY YOU WERE NOT SENTIMENTAL
I THOUGHT YOU
APPEARED CONFUSED WHEN MY SISTERS TOLD YOU THE WORDS AS IF YOU FELT
FLATTERED
YOU TURNED RED JUST LIKE A CERTAIN VAIN LITTLE LAD AT OUR
SCHOOL WHO ALWAYS THINKS PROPER TO BLUSH WHEN HE GETS A RISE IN THE
CLASS
FOR YOUR BENEFIT MR
MOORE I'VE BEEN LOOKING UP THE WORD
'SENTIMENTAL' IN THE DICTIONARY AND I FIND IT TO MEAN 'TINCTURED WITH
SENTIMENT ON EXAMINING FURTHER 'SENTIMENT' IS EXPLAINED TO BE
THOUGHT IDEA NOTION
A SENTIMENTAL MAN THEN IS ONE WHO HAS THOUGHTS
IDEAS NOTIONS AN UNSENTIMENTAL MAN IS ONE DESTITUTE OF THOUGHT IDEA
OR NOTION
AND MARK STOPPED
HE DID NOT SMILE HE DID NOT LOOK ROUND FOR
ADMIRATION
HE HAD SAID HIS SAY AND WAS SILENT
MA FOI MON AMI OBSERVED MR
MOORE TO YORKE CE SONT VRAIMENT DES
ENFANTS TERRIBLES QUE LES VTRES
ROSE WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO MARK'S SPEECH REPLIED TO
HIM THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THOUGHTS IDEAS AND NOTIONS SAID
SHE GOOD AND BAD
SENTIMENTAL MUST REFER TO THE BAD OR MISS HELSTONE
MUST HAVE TAKEN IT IN THAT SENSE FOR SHE WAS NOT BLAMING MR
MOORE SHE
WAS DEFENDING HIM
THAT'S MY KIND LITTLE ADVOCATE SAID MOORE TAKING ROSE'S HAND
SHE WAS DEFENDING HIM REPEATED ROSE AS I SHOULD HAVE DONE HAD I
BEEN IN HER PLACE FOR THE OTHER LADIES SEEMED TO SPEAK SPITEFULLY
LADIES ALWAYS DO SPEAK SPITEFULLY OBSERVED MARTIN
IT IS THE NATURE
OF WOMENITES TO BE SPITEFUL
MATTHEW NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME OPENED HIS LIPS
WHAT A FOOL MARTIN
IS TO BE ALWAYS GABBLING ABOUT WHAT HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
IT IS MY PRIVILEGE AS A FREEMAN TO GABBLE ON WHATEVER SUBJECT I
LIKE RESPONDED MARTIN
YOU USE IT OR RATHER ABUSE IT TO SUCH AN EXTENT REJOINED THE ELDER
BROTHER THAT YOU PROVE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A SLAVE
A SLAVE A SLAVE THAT TO A YORKE AND FROM A YORKE THIS FELLOW HE
ADDED STANDING UP AT THE TABLE AND POINTING ACROSS IT TO
MATTHEW THIS FELLOW FORGETS WHAT EVERY COTTIER IN BRIARFIELD KNOWS
THAT ALL BORN OF OUR HOUSE HAVE THAT ARCHED INSTEP UNDER WHICH WATER CAN
FLOW PROOF THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SLAVE OF THE BLOOD FOR THREE
HUNDRED YEARS
MOUNTEBANK SAID MATTHEW
LADS BE SILENT EXCLAIMED MR
YORKE MARTIN YOU ARE A
MISCHIEF MAKER
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO DISTURBANCE BUT FOR YOU
INDEED IS THAT CORRECT DID I BEGIN OR DID MATTHEW HAD I SPOKEN TO
HIM WHEN HE ACCUSED ME OF GABBLING LIKE A FOOL
A PRESUMPTUOUS FOOL REPEATED MATTHEW
HERE MRS
YORKE COMMENCED ROCKING HERSELF RATHER A PORTENTOUS MOVEMENT
WITH HER AS IT WAS OCCASIONALLY FOLLOWED ESPECIALLY WHEN MATTHEW WAS
WORSTED IN A CONFLICT BY A FIT OF HYSTERICS
I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD BEAR INSOLENCE FROM MATTHEW YORKE OR WHAT
RIGHT HE HAS TO USE BAD LANGUAGE TO ME OBSERVED MARTIN
HE HAS NO RIGHT MY LAD BUT FORGIVE YOUR BROTHER UNTIL
SEVENTY AND SEVEN TIMES SAID MR
YORKE SOOTHINGLY
ALWAYS ALIKE AND THEORY AND PRACTICE ALWAYS ADVERSE MURMURED MARTIN
AS HE TURNED TO LEAVE THE ROOM
WHERE ART THOU GOING MY SON ASKED THE FATHER
SOMEWHERE WHERE I SHALL BE SAFE FROM INSULT IF IN THIS HOUSE I CAN
FIND ANY SUCH PLACE
MATTHEW LAUGHED VERY INSOLENTLY
MARTIN THREW A STRANGE LOOK AT HIM AND
TREMBLED THROUGH ALL HIS SLIGHT LAD'S FRAME BUT HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF
I SUPPOSE THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO MY WITHDRAWING HE INQUIRED
NO
GO MY LAD BUT REMEMBER NOT TO BEAR MALICE
MARTIN WENT AND MATTHEW SENT ANOTHER INSOLENT LAUGH AFTER HIM
ROSE
LIFTING HER FAIR HEAD FROM MOORE'S SHOULDER AGAINST WHICH FOR A
MOMENT IT HAD BEEN RESTING SAID AS SHE DIRECTED A STEADY GAZE TO
MATTHEW MARTIN IS GRIEVED AND YOU ARE GLAD BUT I WOULD RATHER BE
MARTIN THAN YOU
I DISLIKE YOUR NATURE
HERE MR
MOORE BY WAY OF AVERTING OR AT LEAST ESCAPING A SCENE WHICH
A SOB FROM MRS
YORKE WARNED HIM WAS LIKELY TO COME ON ROSE AND
PUTTING JESSY OFF HIS KNEE HE KISSED HER AND ROSE REMINDING THEM AT
THE SAME TIME TO BE SURE AND COME TO THE HOLLOW IN GOOD TIME TO MORROW
AFTERNOON THEN HAVING TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS HOSTESS HE SAID TO MR
YORKE MAY I SPEAK A WORD WITH YOU AND WAS FOLLOWED BY HIM FROM THE
ROOM
THEIR BRIEF CONFERENCE TOOK PLACE IN THE HALL
HAVE YOU EMPLOYMENT FOR A GOOD WORKMAN ASKED MOORE
A NONSENSE QUESTION IN THESE TIMES WHEN YOU KNOW THAT EVERY MASTER HAS
MANY GOOD WORKMEN TO WHOM HE CANNOT GIVE FULL EMPLOYMENT
YOU MUST OBLIGE ME BY TAKING ON THIS MAN IF POSSIBLE
MY LAD I CAN TAKE ON NO MORE HANDS TO OBLIGE ALL ENGLAND
IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY I MUST FIND HIM A PLACE SOMEWHERE
WHO IS HE
WILLIAM FARREN
I KNOW WILLIAM
A RIGHT DOWN HONEST MAN IS WILLIAM
HE HAS BEEN OUT OF WORK THREE MONTHS
HE HAS A LARGE FAMILY
WE ARE
SURE THEY CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT WAGES
HE WAS ONE OF THE DEPUTATION OF
CLOTH DRESSERS WHO CAME TO ME THIS MORNING TO COMPLAIN AND THREATEN
WILLIAM DID NOT THREATEN
HE ONLY ASKED ME TO GIVE THEM RATHER MORE
TIME TO MAKE MY CHANGES MORE SLOWLY
YOU KNOW I CANNOT DO THAT
STRAITENED ON ALL SIDES AS I AM I HAVE NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO PUSH ON
I
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IDLE TO PALAVER LONG WITH THEM
I SENT THEM AWAY
AFTER ARRESTING A RASCAL AMONGST THEM WHOM I HOPE TO TRANSPORT A
FELLOW WHO PREACHES AT THE CHAPEL YONDER SOMETIMES
NOT MOSES BARRACLOUGH
YES
AH YOU'VE ARRESTED HIM GOOD THEN OUT OF A SCOUNDREL YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE A MARTYR
YOU'VE DONE A WISE THING
I'VE DONE A RIGHT THING
WELL THE SHORT AND THE LONG OF IT IS I'M
DETERMINED TO GET FARREN A PLACE AND I RECKON ON YOU TO GIVE HIM ONE
THIS IS COOL HOWEVER EXCLAIMED MR
YORKE
WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO
RECKON ON ME TO PROVIDE FOR YOUR DISMISSED WORKMEN WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT
YOUR FARRENS AND YOUR WILLIAMS I'VE HEARD HE'S AN HONEST MAN BUT AM I
TO SUPPORT ALL THE HONEST MEN IN YORKSHIRE YOU MAY SAY THAT WOULD BE NO
GREAT CHARGE TO UNDERTAKE BUT GREAT OR LITTLE I'LL NONE OF IT
COME MR
YORKE WHAT CAN YOU FIND FOR HIM TO DO
I FIND YOU'LL MAKE ME USE LANGUAGE I'M NOT ACCUSTOMED TO USE
I WISH
YOU WOULD GO HOME
HERE IS THE DOOR SET OFF
MOORE SAT DOWN ON ONE OF THE HALL CHAIRS
YOU CAN'T GIVE HIM WORK IN YOUR MILL GOOD BUT YOU HAVE LAND
FIND HIM
SOME OCCUPATION ON YOUR LAND MR
YORKE
BOB I THOUGHT YOU CARED NOTHING ABOUT OUR LOURDAUDS DE PAYSANS
I
DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS CHANGE
I DO
THE FELLOW SPOKE TO ME NOTHING BUT TRUTH AND SENSE
I ANSWERED
HIM JUST AS ROUGHLY AS I DID THE REST WHO JABBERED MERE GIBBERISH
I
COULDN'T MAKE DISTINCTIONS THERE AND THEN
HIS APPEARANCE TOLD WHAT HE
HAD GONE THROUGH LATELY CLEARER THAN HIS WORDS BUT WHERE IS THE USE OF
EXPLAINING LET HIM HAVE WORK
LET HIM HAVE IT YOURSELF
IF YOU ARE SO VERY MUCH IN EARNEST STRAIN A
POINT
IF THERE WAS A POINT LEFT IN MY AFFAIRS TO STRAIN I WOULD STRAIN IT
TILL IT CRACKED AGAIN BUT I RECEIVED LETTERS THIS MORNING WHICH SHOWED
ME PRETTY CLEARLY WHERE I STAND AND IT IS NOT FAR OFF THE END OF THE
PLANK
MY FOREIGN MARKET AT ANY RATE IS GORGED
IF THERE IS NO
CHANGE IF THERE DAWNS NO PROSPECT OF PEACE IF THE ORDERS IN COUNCIL
ARE NOT AT LEAST SUSPENDED SO AS TO OPEN OUR WAY IN THE WEST I DO
NOT KNOW WHERE I AM TO TURN
I SEE NO MORE LIGHT THAN IF I WERE SEALED
IN A ROCK SO THAT FOR ME TO PRETEND TO OFFER A MAN A LIVELIHOOD WOULD
BE TO DO A DISHONEST THING
COME LET US TAKE A TURN ON THE FRONT
IT IS A STARLIGHT NIGHT SAID
MR
YORKE
THEY PASSED OUT CLOSING THE FRONT DOOR AFTER THEM AND SIDE BY SIDE
PACED THE FROST WHITE PAVEMENT TO AND FRO
SETTLE ABOUT FARREN AT ONCE URGED MR
MOORE
YOU HAVE LARGE
FRUIT GARDENS AT YORKE MILLS
HE IS A GOOD GARDENER
GIVE HIM WORK
THERE
WELL SO BE IT
I'LL SEND FOR HIM TO MORROW AND WE'LL SEE
AND NOW MY
LAD YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONDITION OF YOUR AFFAIRS
YES A SECOND FAILURE WHICH I MAY DELAY BUT WHICH AT THIS MOMENT I
SEE NO WAY FINALLY TO AVERT WOULD BLIGHT THE NAME OF MOORE COMPLETELY
AND YOU ARE AWARE I HAD FINE INTENTIONS OF PAYING OFF EVERY DEBT AND
RE ESTABLISHING THE OLD FIRM ON ITS FORMER BASIS
YOU WANT CAPITAL THAT'S ALL YOU WANT
YES BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT BREATH IS ALL A DEAD MAN WANTS TO
LIVE
I KNOW I KNOW CAPITAL IS NOT TO BE HAD FOR THE ASKING AND IF YOU WERE
A MARRIED MAN AND HAD A FAMILY LIKE ME I SHOULD THINK YOUR CASE
PRETTY NIGH DESPERATE BUT THE YOUNG AND UNENCUMBERED HAVE CHANCES
PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES
I HEAR GOSSIP NOW AND THEN ABOUT YOUR BEING ON
THE EVE OF MARRIAGE WITH THIS MISS AND THAT BUT I SUPPOSE IT IS NONE OF
IT TRUE
YOU MAY WELL SUPPOSE THAT
I THINK I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO BE
DREAMING OF MARRIAGE
MARRIAGE I CANNOT BEAR THE WORD IT SOUNDS SO
SILLY AND UTOPIAN
I HAVE SETTLED IT DECIDEDLY THAT MARRIAGE AND LOVE
ARE SUPERFLUITIES INTENDED ONLY FOR THE RICH WHO LIVE AT EASE AND
HAVE NO NEED TO TAKE THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW OR DESPERATIONS THE LAST
AND RECKLESS JOY OF THE DEEPLY WRETCHED WHO NEVER HOPE TO RISE OUT OF
THE SLOUGH OF THEIR UTTER POVERTY
I SHOULD NOT THINK SO IF I WERE CIRCUMSTANCED AS YOU ARE
I SHOULD
THINK I COULD VERY LIKELY GET A WIFE WITH A FEW THOUSANDS WHO WOULD
SUIT BOTH ME AND MY AFFAIRS
I WONDER WHERE
WOULD YOU TRY IF YOU HAD A CHANCE
I DON'T KNOW
IT DEPENDS ON IN SHORT IT DEPENDS ON MANY THINGS
WOULD YOU TAKE AN OLD WOMAN
I'D RATHER BREAK STONES ON THE ROAD
SO WOULD I
WOULD YOU TAKE AN UGLY ONE
BAH I HATE UGLINESS AND DELIGHT IN BEAUTY
MY EYES AND HEART YORKE
TAKE PLEASURE IN A SWEET YOUNG FAIR FACE AS THEY ARE REPELLED BY A
GRIM RUGGED MEAGRE ONE
SOFT DELICATE LINES AND HUES PLEASE HARSH
ONES PREJUDICE ME
I WON'T HAVE AN UGLY WIFE
NOT IF SHE WERE RICH
NOT IF SHE WERE DRESSED IN GEMS
I COULD NOT LOVE I COULD NOT FANCY I
COULD NOT ENDURE HER
MY TASTE MUST HAVE SATISFACTION OR DISGUST WOULD
BREAK OUT IN DESPOTISM OR WORSE FREEZE TO UTTER ICINESS
WHAT BOB IF YOU MARRIED AN HONEST GOOD NATURED AND WEALTHY LASS
THOUGH A LITTLE HARD FAVOURED COULDN'T YOU PUT UP WITH THE HIGH
CHEEK BONES THE RATHER WIDE MOUTH AND REDDISH HAIR
I'LL NEVER TRY I TELL YOU
GRACE AT LEAST I WILL HAVE AND YOUTH AND
SYMMETRY YES AND WHAT I CALL BEAUTY
AND POVERTY AND A NURSERY FULL OF BAIRNS YOU CAN NEITHER CLOTHE NOR
FEED AND VERY SOON AN ANXIOUS FADED MOTHER AND THEN BANKRUPTCY
DISCREDIT A LIFE LONG STRUGGLE
LET ME ALONE YORKE
IF YOU ARE ROMANTIC ROBERT AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN LOVE
IT IS OF NO USE TALKING
I AM NOT ROMANTIC
I AM STRIPPED OF ROMANCE AS BARE AS THE WHITE
TENTERS IN THAT FIELD ARE OF CLOTH
ALWAYS USE SUCH FIGURES OF SPEECH LAD I CAN UNDERSTAND THEM
AND
THERE IS NO LOVE AFFAIR TO DISTURB YOUR JUDGMENT
I THOUGHT I HAD SAID ENOUGH ON THAT SUBJECT BEFORE
LOVE FOR ME
STUFF
WELL THEN IF YOU ARE SOUND BOTH IN HEART AND HEAD THERE IS NO
REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT PROFIT BY A GOOD CHANCE IF IT OFFERS
THEREFORE WAIT AND SEE
YOU ARE QUITE ORACULAR YORKE
I THINK I AM A BIT I' THAT LINE
I PROMISE YE NAUGHT AND I ADVISE YE
NAUGHT BUT I BID YE KEEP YOUR HEART UP AND BE GUIDED BY
CIRCUMSTANCES
MY NAMESAKE THE PHYSICIAN'S ALMANAC COULD NOT SPEAK MORE GUARDEDLY
IN THE MEANTIME I CARE NAUGHT ABOUT YE ROBERT MOORE YE ARE NOTHING
AKIN TO ME OR MINE AND WHETHER YE LOSE OR FIND A FORTUNE IT MAKS NO
DIFFERENCE TO ME
GO HOME NOW
IT HAS STRICKEN TEN
MISS HORTENSE WILL
BE WONDERING WHERE YE ARE
CHAPTER X
OLD MAIDS
TIME WORE ON AND SPRING MATURED
THE SURFACE OF ENGLAND BEGAN TO LOOK
PLEASANT HER FIELDS GREW GREEN HER HILLS FRESH HER GARDENS BLOOMING
BUT AT HEART SHE WAS NO BETTER
STILL HER POOR WERE WRETCHED STILL
THEIR EMPLOYERS WERE HARASSED
COMMERCE IN SOME OF ITS BRANCHES SEEMED
THREATENED WITH PARALYSIS FOR THE WAR CONTINUED ENGLAND'S BLOOD WAS
SHED AND HER WEALTH LAVISHED ALL IT SEEMED TO ATTAIN MOST INADEQUATE
ENDS
SOME TIDINGS THERE WERE INDEED OCCASIONALLY OF SUCCESSES IN THE
PENINSULA BUT THESE CAME IN SLOWLY LONG INTERVALS OCCURRED BETWEEN IN
WHICH NO NOTE WAS HEARD BUT THE INSOLENT SELF FELICITATIONS OF BONAPARTE
ON HIS CONTINUED TRIUMPHS
THOSE WHO SUFFERED FROM THE RESULTS OF THE
WAR FELT THIS TEDIOUS AND AS THEY THOUGHT HOPELESS STRUGGLE AGAINST
WHAT THEIR FEARS OR THEIR INTERESTS TAUGHT THEM TO REGARD AS AN
INVINCIBLE POWER MOST INSUFFERABLE
THEY DEMANDED PEACE ON ANY TERMS
MEN LIKE YORKE AND MOORE AND THERE WERE THOUSANDS WHOM THE WAR PLACED
WHERE IT PLACED THEM SHUDDERING ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY INSISTED ON
PEACE WITH THE ENERGY OF DESPERATION
THEY HELD MEETINGS THEY MADE SPEECHES THEY GOT UP PETITIONS TO EXTORT
THIS BOON ON WHAT TERMS IT WAS MADE THEY CARED NOT
ALL MEN TAKEN SINGLY ARE MORE OR LESS SELFISH AND TAKEN IN BODIES
THEY ARE INTENSELY SO
THE BRITISH MERCHANT IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS
RULE THE MERCANTILE CLASSES ILLUSTRATE IT STRIKINGLY
THESE CLASSES
CERTAINLY THINK TOO EXCLUSIVELY OF MAKING MONEY THEY ARE TOO OBLIVIOUS
OF EVERY NATIONAL CONSIDERATION BUT THAT OF EXTENDING ENGLAND'S THAT
IS THEIR OWN COMMERCE
CHIVALROUS FEELING DISINTERESTEDNESS PRIDE IN
HONOUR IS TOO DEAD IN THEIR HEARTS
A LAND RULED BY THEM ALONE WOULD
TOO OFTEN MAKE IGNOMINIOUS SUBMISSION NOT AT ALL FROM THE MOTIVES
CHRIST TEACHES BUT RATHER FROM THOSE MAMMON INSTILS
DURING THE LATE
WAR THE TRADESMEN OF ENGLAND WOULD HAVE ENDURED BUFFETS FROM THE
FRENCH ON THE RIGHT CHEEK AND ON THE LEFT THEIR CLOAK THEY WOULD HAVE
GIVEN TO NAPOLEON AND THEN HAVE POLITELY OFFERED HIM THEIR COAT ALSO
NOR WOULD THEY HAVE WITHHELD THEIR WAISTCOAT IF URGED THEY WOULD HAVE
PRAYED PERMISSION ONLY TO RETAIN THEIR ONE OTHER GARMENT FOR THE SAKE
OF THE PURSE IN ITS POCKET
NOT ONE SPARK OF SPIRIT NOT ONE SYMPTOM OF
RESISTANCE WOULD THEY HAVE SHOWN TILL THE HAND OF THE CORSICAN BANDIT
HAD GRASPED THAT BELOVED PURSE THEN PERHAPS TRANSFIGURED AT ONCE
INTO BRITISH BULLDOGS THEY WOULD HAVE SPRUNG AT THE ROBBER'S THROAT
AND THERE THEY WOULD HAVE FASTENED AND THERE HUNG INVETERATE
INSATIABLE TILL THE TREASURE HAD BEEN RESTORED
TRADESMEN WHEN THEY
SPEAK AGAINST WAR ALWAYS PROFESS TO HATE IT BECAUSE IT IS A BLOODY AND
BARBAROUS PROCEEDING
YOU WOULD THINK TO HEAR THEM TALK THAT THEY ARE
PECULIARLY CIVILIZED ESPECIALLY GENTLE AND KINDLY OF DISPOSITION TO
THEIR FELLOW MEN
THIS IS NOT THE CASE
MANY OF THEM ARE EXTREMELY
NARROW AND COLD HEARTED HAVE NO GOOD FEELING FOR ANY CLASS BUT THEIR
OWN ARE DISTANT EVEN HOSTILE TO ALL OTHERS CALL THEM USELESS SEEM
TO QUESTION THEIR RIGHT TO EXIST SEEM TO GRUDGE THEM THE VERY AIR THEY
BREATHE AND TO THINK THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR EATING DRINKING AND
LIVING IN DECENT HOUSES QUITE UNJUSTIFIABLE
THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT
OTHERS DO IN THE WAY OF HELPING PLEASING OR TEACHING THEIR RACE THEY
WILL NOT TROUBLE THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE
WHOEVER IS NOT IN TRADE IS
ACCUSED OF EATING THE BREAD OF IDLENESS OF PASSING A USELESS EXISTENCE
LONG MAY IT BE ERE ENGLAND REALLY BECOMES A NATION OF SHOP KEEPERS
WE HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT MOORE WAS NO SELF SACRIFICING PATRIOT AND WE
HAVE ALSO EXPLAINED WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES RENDERED HIM SPECIALLY PRONE TO
CONFINE HIS ATTENTION AND EFFORTS TO THE FURTHERANCE OF HIS INDIVIDUAL
INTEREST ACCORDINGLY WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF URGED A SECOND TIME TO THE
BRINK OF RUIN NONE STRUGGLED HARDER THAN HE AGAINST THE INFLUENCES
WHICH WOULD HAVE THRUST HIM OVER
WHAT HE COULD DO TOWARDS STIRRING
AGITATION IN THE NORTH AGAINST THE WAR HE DID AND HE INSTIGATED OTHERS
WHOSE MONEY AND CONNECTIONS GAVE THEM MORE POWER THAN HE POSSESSED
SOMETIMES BY FLASHES HE FELT THERE WAS LITTLE REASON IN THE DEMANDS
HIS PARTY MADE ON GOVERNMENT
WHEN HE HEARD OF ALL EUROPE THREATENED BY
BONAPARTE AND OF ALL EUROPE ARMING TO RESIST HIM WHEN HE SAW RUSSIA
MENACED AND BEHELD RUSSIA RISING INCENSED AND STERN TO DEFEND HER
FROZEN SOIL HER WILD PROVINCES OF SERFS HER DARK NATIVE DESPOTISM
FROM THE TREAD THE YOKE THE TYRANNY OF A FOREIGN VICTOR HE KNEW THAT
ENGLAND A FREE REALM COULD NOT THEN DEPUTE HER SONS TO MAKE
CONCESSIONS AND PROPOSE TERMS TO THE UNJUST GRASPING FRENCH LEADER
WHEN NEWS CAME FROM TIME TO TIME OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THAT MAN THEN
REPRESENTING ENGLAND IN THE PENINSULA OF HIS ADVANCE FROM SUCCESS TO
SUCCESS THAT ADVANCE SO DELIBERATE BUT SO UNSWERVING SO CIRCUMSPECT
BUT SO CERTAIN SO UNHASTING BUT SO UNRESTING WHEN HE READ LORD
WELLINGTON'S OWN DISPATCHES IN THE COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPERS DOCUMENTS
WRITTEN BY MODESTY TO THE DICTATION OF TRUTH MOORE CONFESSED AT HEART
THAT A POWER WAS WITH THE TROOPS OF BRITAIN OF THAT VIGILANT ENDURING
GENUINE UNOSTENTATIOUS SORT WHICH MUST WIN VICTORY TO THE SIDE IT LED
IN THE END
IN THE END BUT THAT END HE THOUGHT WAS YET FAR OFF AND
MEANTIME HE MOORE AS AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE CRUSHED HIS HOPES GROUND
TO DUST
IT WAS HIMSELF HE HAD TO CARE FOR HIS HOPES HE HAD TO PURSUE
AND HE WOULD FULFIL HIS DESTINY
HE FULFILLED IT SO VIGOROUSLY THAT ERE LONG HE CAME TO A DECISIVE
RUPTURE WITH HIS OLD TORY FRIEND THE RECTOR
THEY QUARRELLED AT A PUBLIC
MEETING AND AFTERWARDS EXCHANGED SOME PUNGENT LETTERS IN THE
NEWSPAPERS
MR
HELSTONE DENOUNCED MOORE AS A JACOBIN CEASED TO SEE
HIM WOULD NOT EVEN SPEAK TO HIM WHEN THEY MET
HE INTIMATED ALSO TO HIS
NIECE VERY DISTINCTLY THAT HER COMMUNICATIONS WITH HOLLOW'S COTTAGE
MUST FOR THE PRESENT CEASE SHE MUST GIVE UP TAKING FRENCH LESSONS
THE
LANGUAGE HE OBSERVED WAS A BAD AND FRIVOLOUS ONE AT THE BEST AND MOST
OF THE WORKS IT BOASTED WERE BAD AND FRIVOLOUS HIGHLY INJURIOUS IN
THEIR TENDENCY TO WEAK FEMALE MINDS
HE WONDERED HE REMARKED
PARENTHETICALLY WHAT NOODLE FIRST MADE IT THE FASHION TO TEACH WOMEN
FRENCH
NOTHING WAS MORE IMPROPER FOR THEM
IT WAS LIKE FEEDING A
RICKETY CHILD ON CHALK AND WATER GRUEL
CAROLINE MUST GIVE IT UP AND
GIVE UP HER COUSINS TOO
THEY WERE DANGEROUS PEOPLE
MR
HELSTONE QUITE EXPECTED OPPOSITION TO THIS ORDER HE EXPECTED TEARS
SELDOM DID HE TROUBLE HIMSELF ABOUT CAROLINE'S MOVEMENTS BUT A VAGUE
IDEA POSSESSED HIM THAT SHE WAS FOND OF GOING TO HOLLOW'S COTTAGE ALSO
HE SUSPECTED THAT SHE LIKED ROBERT MOORE'S OCCASIONAL PRESENCE AT THE
RECTORY
THE COSSACK HAD PERCEIVED THAT WHEREAS IF MALONE STEPPED IN OF
AN EVENING TO MAKE HIMSELF SOCIABLE AND CHARMING BY PINCHING THE EARS
OF AN AGED BLACK CAT WHICH USUALLY SHARED WITH MISS HELSTONE'S FEET THE
ACCOMMODATION OF HER FOOTSTOOL OR BY BORROWING A FOWLING PIECE AND
BANGING AWAY AT A TOOL SHED DOOR IN THE GARDEN WHILE ENOUGH OF DAYLIGHT
REMAINED TO SHOW THAT CONSPICUOUS MARK KEEPING THE PASSAGE AND
SITTING ROOM DOORS MEANTIME UNCOMFORTABLY OPEN FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF
RUNNING IN AND OUT TO ANNOUNCE HIS FAILURES AND SUCCESSES WITH NOISY
BRUSQUERIE HE HAD OBSERVED THAT UNDER SUCH ENTERTAINING CIRCUMSTANCES
CAROLINE HAD A TRICK OF DISAPPEARING TRIPPING NOISELESSLY UPSTAIRS AND
REMAINING INVISIBLE TILL CALLED DOWN TO SUPPER
ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN
ROBERT MOORE WAS THE GUEST THOUGH HE ELICITED NO VIVACITIES FROM THE
CAT DID NOTHING TO IT INDEED BEYOND OCCASIONALLY COAXING IT FROM THE
STOOL TO HIS KNEE AND THERE LETTING IT PURR CLIMB TO HIS SHOULDER AND
RUB ITS HEAD AGAINST HIS CHEEK THOUGH THERE WAS NO EAR SPLITTING
CRACKING OFF OF FIREARMS NO DIFFUSION OF SULPHUROUS GUNPOWDER PERFUME
NO NOISE NO BOASTING DURING HIS STAY THAT STILL CAROLINE SAT IN THE
ROOM AND SEEMED TO FIND WONDROUS CONTENT IN THE STITCHING OF JEW BASKET
PIN CUSHIONS AND THE KNITTING OF MISSIONARY BASKET SOCKS
SHE WAS VERY QUIET AND ROBERT PAID HER LITTLE ATTENTION SCARCELY EVER
ADDRESSING HIS DISCOURSE TO HER BUT MR
HELSTONE NOT BEING ONE OF
THOSE ELDERLY GENTLEMEN WHO ARE EASILY BLINDED ON THE CONTRARY FINDING
HIMSELF ON ALL OCCASIONS EXTREMELY WIDE AWAKE HAD WATCHED THEM WHEN
THEY BADE EACH OTHER GOOD NIGHT
HE HAD JUST SEEN THEIR EYES MEET
ONCE ONLY ONCE
SOME NATURES WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN THE GLANCE
THEN SURPRISED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO HARM AND SOME DELIGHT IN IT
IT WAS
BY NO MEANS A GLANCE OF MUTUAL INTELLIGENCE FOR MUTUAL LOVE SECRETS
EXISTED NOT BETWEEN THEM
THERE WAS NOTHING THEN OF CRAFT AND
CONCEALMENT TO OFFEND ONLY MR
MOORE'S EYES LOOKING INTO CAROLINE'S
FELT THEY WERE CLEAR AND GENTLE AND CAROLINE'S EYES ENCOUNTERING MR
MOORE'S CONFESSED THEY WERE MANLY AND SEARCHING
EACH ACKNOWLEDGED THE
CHARM IN HIS OR HER OWN WAY
MOORE SMILED SLIGHTLY AND CAROLINE
COLOURED AS SLIGHTLY
MR
HELSTONE COULD ON THE SPOT HAVE RATED THEM
BOTH
THEY ANNOYED HIM
WHY IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
IF YOU HAD ASKED HIM
WHAT MOORE MERITED AT THAT MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE SAID A HORSEWHIP IF
YOU HAD INQUIRED INTO CAROLINE'S DESERTS HE WOULD HAVE ADJUDGED HER A
BOX ON THE EAR IF YOU HAD FURTHER DEMANDED THE REASON OF SUCH
CHASTISEMENTS HE WOULD HAVE STORMED AGAINST FLIRTATION AND
LOVE MAKING AND VOWED HE WOULD HAVE NO SUCH FOLLY GOING ON UNDER HIS
ROOF
THESE PRIVATE CONSIDERATIONS COMBINED WITH POLITICAL REASONS FIXED HIS
RESOLUTION OF SEPARATING THE COUSINS
HE ANNOUNCED HIS WILL TO CAROLINE
ONE EVENING AS SHE WAS SITTING AT WORK NEAR THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW
HER
FACE WAS TURNED TOWARDS HIM AND THE LIGHT FELL FULL UPON IT
IT HAD
STRUCK HIM A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THAT SHE WAS LOOKING PALER AND QUIETER
THAN SHE USED TO LOOK
IT HAD NOT ESCAPED HIM EITHER THAT ROBERT MOORE'S
NAME HAD NEVER FOR SOME THREE WEEKS PAST DROPPED FROM HER LIPS NOR
DURING THE SAME SPACE OF TIME HAD THAT PERSONAGE MADE HIS APPEARANCE AT
THE RECTORY
SOME SUSPICION OF CLANDESTINE MEETINGS HAUNTED HIS MIND
HAVING BUT AN INDIFFERENT OPINION OF WOMEN HE ALWAYS SUSPECTED THEM
HE
THOUGHT THEY NEEDED CONSTANT WATCHING
IT WAS IN A TONE DRYLY
SIGNIFICANT HE DESIRED HER TO CEASE HER DAILY VISITS TO THE HOLLOW
HE
EXPECTED A START A LOOK OF DEPRECIATION
THE START HE SAW BUT IT WAS A
VERY SLIGHT ONE NO LOOK WHATEVER WAS DIRECTED TO HIM
DO YOU HEAR ME HE ASKED
YES UNCLE
OF COURSE YOU MEAN TO ATTEND TO WHAT I SAY
YES CERTAINLY
AND THERE MUST BE NO LETTER SCRIBBLING TO YOUR COUSIN HORTENSE NO
INTERCOURSE WHATEVER
I DO NOT APPROVE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE FAMILY
THEY ARE JACOBINICAL
VERY WELL SAID CAROLINE QUIETLY
SHE ACQUIESCED THEN
THERE WAS NO
VEXED FLUSHING OF THE FACE NO GATHERING TEARS THE SHADOWY
THOUGHTFULNESS WHICH HAD COVERED HER FEATURES ERE MR
HELSTONE SPOKE
REMAINED UNDISTURBED SHE WAS OBEDIENT
YES PERFECTLY BECAUSE THE MANDATE COINCIDED WITH HER OWN PREVIOUS
JUDGMENT BECAUSE IT WAS NOW BECOME PAIN TO HER TO GO TO HOLLOW'S
COTTAGE NOTHING MET HER THERE BUT DISAPPOINTMENT
HOPE AND LOVE HAD
QUITTED THAT LITTLE TENEMENT FOR ROBERT SEEMED TO HAVE DESERTED ITS
PRECINCTS
WHENEVER SHE ASKED AFTER HIM WHICH SHE VERY SELDOM DID
SINCE THE MERE UTTERANCE OF HIS NAME MADE HER FACE GROW HOT THE ANSWER
WAS HE WAS FROM HOME OR HE WAS QUITE TAKEN UP WITH BUSINESS
HORTENSE
FEARED HE WAS KILLING HIMSELF BY APPLICATION
HE SCARCELY EVER TOOK A
MEAL IN THE HOUSE HE LIVED IN THE COUNTING HOUSE
AT CHURCH ONLY CAROLINE HAD THE CHANCE OF SEEING HIM AND THERE SHE
RARELY LOOKED AT HIM
IT WAS BOTH TOO MUCH PAIN AND TOO MUCH PLEASURE
TO LOOK IT EXCITED TOO MUCH EMOTION AND THAT IT WAS ALL WASTED EMOTION
SHE HAD LEARNED WELL TO COMPREHEND
ONCE ON A DARK WET SUNDAY WHEN THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE AT CHURCH AND
WHEN ESPECIALLY CERTAIN LADIES WERE ABSENT OF WHOSE OBSERVANT FACULTIES
AND TOMAHAWK TONGUES CAROLINE STOOD IN AWE SHE HAD ALLOWED HER EYE TO
SEEK ROBERT'S PEW AND TO REST AWHILE ON ITS OCCUPANT
HE WAS THERE
ALONE
HORTENSE HAD BEEN KEPT AT HOME BY PRUDENT CONSIDERATIONS RELATIVE
TO THE RAIN AND A NEW SPRING CHAPEAU
DURING THE SERMON HE SAT WITH
FOLDED ARMS AND EYES CAST DOWN LOOKING VERY SAD AND ABSTRACTED
WHEN
DEPRESSED THE VERY HUE OF HIS FACE SEEMED MORE DUSK THAN WHEN HE
SMILED AND TO DAY CHEEK AND FOREHEAD WORE THEIR MOST TINTLESS AND SOBER
OLIVE
BY INSTINCT CAROLINE KNEW AS SHE EXAMINED THAT CLOUDED
COUNTENANCE THAT HIS THOUGHTS WERE RUNNING IN NO FAMILIAR OR KINDLY
CHANNEL THAT THEY WERE FAR AWAY NOT MERELY FROM HER BUT FROM ALL
WHICH SHE COULD COMPREHEND OR IN WHICH SHE COULD SYMPATHIZE
NOTHING
THAT THEY HAD EVER TALKED OF TOGETHER WAS NOW IN HIS MIND HE WAS WRAPT
FROM HER BY INTERESTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN WHICH IT WAS DEEMED SUCH
AS SHE COULD HAVE NO PART
CAROLINE MEDITATED IN HER OWN WAY ON THE SUBJECT SPECULATED ON HIS
FEELINGS ON HIS LIFE ON HIS FEARS ON HIS FATE MUSED OVER THE MYSTERY
OF BUSINESS TRIED TO COMPREHEND MORE ABOUT IT THAN HAD EVER BEEN TOLD
HER TO UNDERSTAND ITS PERPLEXITIES LIABILITIES DUTIES EXACTIONS
ENDEAVOURED TO REALIZE THE STATE OF MIND OF A MAN OF BUSINESS TO
ENTER INTO IT FEEL WHAT HE WOULD FEEL ASPIRE TO WHAT HE WOULD ASPIRE
HER EARNEST WISH WAS TO SEE THINGS AS THEY WERE AND NOT TO BE ROMANTIC
BY DINT OF EFFORT SHE CONTRIVED TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE LIGHT OF TRUTH
HERE AND THERE AND HOPED THAT SCANT RAY MIGHT SUFFICE TO GUIDE HER
DIFFERENT INDEED SHE CONCLUDED IS ROBERT'S MENTAL CONDITION TO
MINE
I THINK ONLY OF HIM HE HAS NO ROOM NO LEISURE TO THINK OF ME
THE FEELING CALLED LOVE IS AND HAS BEEN FOR TWO YEARS THE PREDOMINANT
EMOTION OF MY HEART ALWAYS THERE ALWAYS AWAKE ALWAYS ASTIR
QUITE
OTHER FEELINGS ABSORB HIS REFLECTIONS AND GOVERN HIS FACULTIES
HE IS
RISING NOW GOING TO LEAVE THE CHURCH FOR SERVICE IS OVER
WILL HE TURN
HIS HEAD TOWARDS THIS PEW NO NOT ONCE
HE HAS NOT ONE LOOK FOR ME
THAT IS HARD
A KIND GLANCE WOULD HAVE MADE ME HAPPY TILL TO MORROW
I
HAVE NOT GOT IT HE WOULD NOT GIVE IT HE IS GONE
STRANGE THAT GRIEF
SHOULD NOW ALMOST CHOKE ME BECAUSE ANOTHER HUMAN BEING'S EYE HAS FAILED
TO GREET MINE
THAT SUNDAY EVENING MR
MALONE COMING AS USUAL TO PASS IT WITH HIS
RECTOR CAROLINE WITHDREW AFTER TEA TO HER CHAMBER
FANNY KNOWING HER
HABITS HAD LIT HER A CHEERFUL LITTLE FIRE AS THE WEATHER WAS SO GUSTY
AND CHILL
CLOSETED THERE SILENT AND SOLITARY WHAT COULD SHE DO BUT
THINK SHE NOISELESSLY PACED TO AND FRO THE CARPETED FLOOR HER HEAD
DROOPED HER HANDS FOLDED
IT WAS IRKSOME TO SIT THE CURRENT OF
REFLECTION RAN RAPIDLY THROUGH HER MIND TO NIGHT SHE WAS MUTELY
EXCITED
MUTE WAS THE ROOM MUTE THE HOUSE
THE DOUBLE DOOR OF THE STUDY MUFFLED
THE VOICES OF THE GENTLEMEN
THE SERVANTS WERE QUIET IN THE KITCHEN
ENGAGED WITH BOOKS THEIR YOUNG MISTRESS HAD LENT THEM BOOKS WHICH SHE
HAD TOLD THEM WERE FIT FOR SUNDAY READING AND SHE HERSELF HAD ANOTHER
OF THE SAME SORT OPEN ON THE TABLE BUT SHE COULD NOT READ IT
ITS
THEOLOGY WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO HER AND HER OWN MIND WAS TOO BUSY
TEEMING WANDERING TO LISTEN TO THE LANGUAGE OF ANOTHER MIND
THEN TOO HER IMAGINATION WAS FULL OF PICTURES IMAGES OF MOORE SCENES
WHERE HE AND SHE HAD BEEN TOGETHER WINTER FIRESIDE SKETCHES A GLOWING
LANDSCAPE OF A HOT SUMMER AFTERNOON PASSED WITH HIM IN THE BOSOM OF
NUNNELY WOOD DIVINE VIGNETTES OF MILD SPRING OR MELLOW AUTUMN MOMENTS
WHEN SHE HAD SAT AT HIS SIDE IN HOLLOW'S COPSE LISTENING TO THE CALL OF
THE MAY CUCKOO OR SHARING THE SEPTEMBER TREASURE OF NUTS AND RIPE
BLACKBERRIES A WILD DESSERT WHICH IT WAS HER MORNING'S PLEASURE TO
COLLECT IN A LITTLE BASKET AND COVER WITH GREEN LEAVES AND FRESH
BLOSSOMS AND HER AFTERNOON'S DELIGHT TO ADMINISTER TO MOORE BERRY BY
BERRY AND NUT BY NUT LIKE A BIRD FEEDING ITS FLEDGLING
ROBERT'S FEATURES AND FORM WERE WITH HER THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE WAS
QUITE DISTINCT IN HER EAR HIS FEW CARESSES SEEMED RENEWED
BUT THESE
JOYS BEING HOLLOW WERE ERE LONG CRUSHED IN
THE PICTURES FADED THE
VOICE FAILED THE VISIONARY CLASP MELTED CHILL FROM HER HAND AND WHERE
THE WARM SEAL OF LIPS HAD MADE IMPRESS ON HER FOREHEAD IT FELT NOW AS
IF A SLEETY RAIN DROP HAD FALLEN
SHE RETURNED FROM AN ENCHANTED REGION
TO THE REAL WORLD FOR NUNNELY WOOD IN JUNE SHE SAW HER NARROW CHAMBER
FOR THE SONGS OF BIRDS IN ALLEYS SHE HEARD THE RAIN ON HER CASEMENT FOR
THE SIGH OF THE SOUTH WIND CAME THE SOB OF THE MOURNFUL EAST AND FOR
MOORE'S MANLY COMPANIONSHIP SHE HAD THE THIN ILLUSION OF HER OWN DIM
SHADOW ON THE WALL
TURNING FROM THE PALE PHANTOM WHICH REFLECTED
HERSELF IN ITS OUTLINE AND HER REVERIE IN THE DROOPED ATTITUDE OF ITS
DIM HEAD AND COLOURLESS TRESSES SHE SAT DOWN INACTION WOULD SUIT THE
FRAME OF MIND INTO WHICH SHE WAS NOW DECLINING SHE SAID TO HERSELF I
HAVE TO LIVE PERHAPS TILL SEVENTY YEARS
AS FAR AS I KNOW I HAVE GOOD
HEALTH HALF A CENTURY OF EXISTENCE MAY LIE BEFORE ME
HOW AM I TO
OCCUPY IT WHAT AM I TO DO TO FILL THE INTERVAL OF TIME WHICH SPREADS
BETWEEN ME AND THE GRAVE
SHE REFLECTED
I SHALL NOT BE MARRIED IT APPEARS SHE CONTINUED
I SUPPOSE AS
ROBERT DOES NOT CARE FOR ME I SHALL NEVER HAVE A HUSBAND TO LOVE NOR
LITTLE CHILDREN TO TAKE CARE OF
TILL LATELY I HAD RECKONED SECURELY ON
THE DUTIES AND AFFECTIONS OF WIFE AND MOTHER TO OCCUPY MY EXISTENCE
I
CONSIDERED SOMEHOW AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT I WAS GROWING UP TO THE
ORDINARY DESTINY AND NEVER TROUBLED MYSELF TO SEEK ANY OTHER BUT NOW I
PERCEIVE PLAINLY I MAY HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
PROBABLY I SHALL BE AN OLD
MAID
I SHALL LIVE TO SEE ROBERT MARRIED TO SOME ONE ELSE SOME RICH
LADY
I SHALL NEVER MARRY
WHAT WAS I CREATED FOR I WONDER WHERE IS MY
PLACE IN THE WORLD
SHE MUSED AGAIN
AH I SEE SHE PURSUED PRESENTLY THAT IS THE QUESTION WHICH MOST OLD
MAIDS ARE PUZZLED TO SOLVE
OTHER PEOPLE SOLVE IT FOR THEM BY SAYING
'YOUR PLACE IS TO DO GOOD TO OTHERS TO BE HELPFUL WHENEVER HELP IS
WANTED THAT IS RIGHT IN SOME MEASURE AND A VERY CONVENIENT DOCTRINE
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HOLD IT BUT I PERCEIVE THAT CERTAIN SETS OF HUMAN
BEINGS ARE VERY APT TO MAINTAIN THAT OTHER SETS SHOULD GIVE UP THEIR
LIVES TO THEM AND THEIR SERVICE AND THEN THEY REQUITE THEM BY PRAISE
THEY CALL THEM DEVOTED AND VIRTUOUS
IS THIS ENOUGH IS IT TO LIVE IS
THERE NOT A TERRIBLE HOLLOWNESS MOCKERY WANT CRAVING IN THAT
EXISTENCE WHICH IS GIVEN AWAY TO OTHERS FOR WANT OF SOMETHING OF YOUR
OWN TO BESTOW IT ON I SUSPECT THERE IS
DOES VIRTUE LIE IN ABNEGATION
OF SELF I DO NOT BELIEVE IT
UNDUE HUMILITY MAKES TYRANNY WEAK
CONCESSION CREATES SELFISHNESS
THE ROMISH RELIGION ESPECIALLY TEACHES
RENUNCIATION OF SELF SUBMISSION TO OTHERS AND NOWHERE ARE FOUND SO
MANY GRASPING TYRANTS AS IN THE RANKS OF THE ROMISH PRIESTHOOD
EACH
HUMAN BEING HAS HIS SHARE OF RIGHTS
I SUSPECT IT WOULD CONDUCE TO THE
HAPPINESS AND WELFARE OF ALL IF EACH KNEW HIS ALLOTMENT AND HELD TO IT
AS TENACIOUSLY AS THE MARTYR TO HIS CREED
QUEER THOUGHTS THESE THAT
SURGE IN MY MIND
ARE THEY RIGHT THOUGHTS I AM NOT CERTAIN
WELL LIFE IS SHORT AT THE BEST
SEVENTY YEARS THEY SAY PASS LIKE A
VAPOUR LIKE A DREAM WHEN ONE AWAKETH AND EVERY PATH TROD BY HUMAN FEET
TERMINATES IN ONE BOURNE THE GRAVE THE LITTLE CHINK IN THE SURFACE OF
THIS GREAT GLOBE THE FURROW WHERE THE MIGHTY HUSBANDMAN WITH THE SCYTHE
DEPOSITS THE SEED HE HAS SHAKEN FROM THE RIPE STEM AND THERE IT FALLS
DECAYS AND THENCE IT SPRINGS AGAIN WHEN THE WORLD HAS ROLLED ROUND A
FEW TIMES MORE
SO MUCH FOR THE BODY
THE SOUL MEANTIME WINGS ITS LONG
FLIGHT UPWARD FOLDS ITS WINGS ON THE BRINK OF THE SEA OF FIRE AND
GLASS AND GAZING DOWN THROUGH THE BURNING CLEARNESS FINDS THERE
MIRRORED THE VISION OF THE CHRISTIAN'S TRIPLE GODHEAD THE SOVEREIGN
FATHER THE MEDIATING SON THE CREATOR SPIRIT
SUCH WORDS AT LEAST
HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO EXPRESS WHAT IS INEXPRESSIBLE TO DESCRIBE WHAT
BAFFLES DESCRIPTION
THE SOUL'S REAL HEREAFTER WHO SHALL GUESS
HER FIRE WAS DECAYED TO ITS LAST CINDER MALONE HAD DEPARTED AND NOW
THE STUDY BELL RANG FOR PRAYERS
THE NEXT DAY CAROLINE HAD TO SPEND ALTOGETHER ALONE HER UNCLE BEING
GONE TO DINE WITH HIS FRIEND DR
BOULTBY VICAR OF WHINBURY
THE WHOLE
TIME SHE WAS TALKING INWARDLY IN THE SAME STRAIN LOOKING FORWARDS
ASKING WHAT SHE WAS TO DO WITH LIFE
FANNY AS SHE PASSED IN AND OUT OF
THE ROOM OCCASIONALLY INTENT ON HOUSEMAID ERRANDS PERCEIVED THAT HER
YOUNG MISTRESS SAT VERY STILL
SHE WAS ALWAYS IN THE SAME PLACE ALWAYS
BENT INDUSTRIOUSLY OVER A PIECE OF WORK
SHE DID NOT LIFT HER HEAD TO
SPEAK TO FANNY AS HER CUSTOM WAS AND WHEN THE LATTER REMARKED THAT THE
DAY WAS FINE AND SHE OUGHT TO TAKE A WALK SHE ONLY SAID IT IS COLD
YOU ARE VERY DILIGENT AT THAT SEWING MISS CAROLINE CONTINUED THE
GIRL APPROACHING HER LITTLE TABLE
I AM TIRED OF IT FANNY
THEN WHY DO YOU GO ON WITH IT PUT IT DOWN
READ OR DO SOMETHING TO
AMUSE YOU
IT IS SOLITARY IN THIS HOUSE FANNY
DON'T YOU THINK SO
I DON'T FIND IT SO MISS
ME AND ELIZA ARE COMPANY FOR ONE ANOTHER BUT
YOU ARE QUITE TOO STILL
YOU SHOULD VISIT MORE
NOW BE PERSUADED GO
UPSTAIRS AND DRESS YOURSELF SMART AND GO AND TAKE TEA IN A FRIENDLY
WAY WITH MISS MANN OR MISS AINLEY
I AM CERTAIN EITHER OF THOSE LADIES
WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
BUT THEIR HOUSES ARE DISMAL THEY ARE BOTH OLD MAIDS
I AM CERTAIN OLD
MAIDS ARE A VERY UNHAPPY RACE
NOT THEY MISS
THEY CAN'T BE UNHAPPY THEY TAKE SUCH CARE OF
THEMSELVES
THEY ARE ALL SELFISH
MISS AINLEY IS NOT SELFISH FANNY
SHE IS ALWAYS DOING GOOD
HOW
DEVOTEDLY KIND SHE WAS TO HER STEP MOTHER AS LONG AS THE OLD LADY LIVED
AND NOW WHEN SHE IS QUITE ALONE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT BROTHER OR SISTER
OR ANY ONE TO CARE FOR HER HOW CHARITABLE SHE IS TO THE POOR AS FAR AS
HER MEANS PERMIT STILL NOBODY THINKS MUCH OF HER OR HAS PLEASURE IN
GOING TO SEE HER AND HOW GENTLEMEN ALWAYS SNEER AT HER
THEY SHOULDN'T MISS
I BELIEVE SHE IS A GOOD WOMAN
BUT GENTLEMEN
THINK ONLY OF LADIES' LOOKS
I'LL GO AND SEE HER EXCLAIMED CAROLINE STARTING UP AND IF SHE ASKS
ME TO STAY TO TEA I'LL STAY
HOW WRONG IT IS TO NEGLECT PEOPLE BECAUSE
THEY ARE NOT PRETTY AND YOUNG AND MERRY AND I WILL CERTAINLY CALL TO
SEE MISS MANN TOO
SHE MAY NOT BE AMIABLE BUT WHAT HAS MADE HER
UNAMIABLE WHAT HAS LIFE BEEN TO HER
FANNY HELPED MISS HELSTONE TO PUT AWAY HER WORK AND AFTERWARDS ASSISTED
HER TO DRESS
YOU 'LL NOT BE AN OLD MAID MISS CAROLINE SHE SAID AS SHE TIED THE
SASH OF HER BROWN SILK FROCK HAVING PREVIOUSLY SMOOTHED HER SOFT FULL
AND SHINING CURLS THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF AN OLD MAID ABOUT YOU
CAROLINE LOOKED AT THE LITTLE MIRROR BEFORE HER AND SHE THOUGHT THERE
WERE SOME SIGNS
SHE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS ALTERED WITHIN THE LAST
MONTH THAT THE HUES OF HER COMPLEXION WERE PALER HER EYES CHANGED A
WAN SHADE SEEMED TO CIRCLE THEM HER COUNTENANCE WAS DEJECTED SHE WAS
NOT IN SHORT SO PRETTY OR SO FRESH AS SHE USED TO BE
SHE DISTANTLY
HINTED THIS TO FANNY FROM WHOM SHE GOT NO DIRECT ANSWER ONLY A REMARK
THAT PEOPLE DID VARY IN THEIR LOOKS BUT THAT AT HER AGE A LITTLE
FALLING AWAY SIGNIFIED NOTHING SHE WOULD SOON COME ROUND AGAIN AND BE
PLUMPER AND ROSIER THAN EVER
HAVING GIVEN THIS ASSURANCE FANNY SHOWED
SINGULAR ZEAL IN WRAPPING HER UP IN WARM SHAWLS AND HANDKERCHIEFS TILL
CAROLINE NEARLY SMOTHERED WITH THE WEIGHT WAS FAIN TO RESIST FURTHER
ADDITIONS
SHE PAID HER VISITS FIRST TO MISS MANN FOR THIS WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT
POINT
MISS MANN WAS CERTAINLY NOT QUITE A LOVABLE PERSON
TILL NOW
CAROLINE HAD ALWAYS UNHESITATINGLY DECLARED SHE DISLIKED HER AND MORE
THAN ONCE SHE HAD JOINED HER COUSIN ROBERT IN LAUGHING AT SOME OF HER
PECULIARITIES
MOORE WAS NOT HABITUALLY GIVEN TO SARCASM ESPECIALLY ON
ANYTHING HUMBLER OR WEAKER THAN HIMSELF BUT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE
HAPPENED TO BE IN THE ROOM WHEN MISS MANN HAD MADE A CALL ON HIS SISTER
AND AFTER LISTENING TO HER CONVERSATION AND VIEWING HER FEATURES FOR A
TIME HE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE GARDEN WHERE HIS LITTLE COUSIN WAS
TENDING SOME OF HIS FAVOURITE FLOWERS AND WHILE STANDING NEAR AND
WATCHING HER HE HAD AMUSED HIMSELF WITH COMPARING FAIR YOUTH DELICATE
AND ATTRACTIVE WITH SHRIVELLED ELD LIVID AND LOVELESS AND IN
JESTINGLY REPEATING TO A SMILING GIRL THE VINEGAR DISCOURSE OF A
CANKERED OLD MAID
ONCE ON SUCH AN OCCASION CAROLINE HAD SAID TO HIM
LOOKING UP FROM THE LUXURIANT CREEPER SHE WAS BINDING TO ITS FRAME AH
ROBERT YOU DO NOT LIKE OLD MAIDS
I TOO SHOULD COME UNDER THE LASH OF
YOUR SARCASM IF I WERE AN OLD MAID
YOU AN OLD MAID HE HAD REPLIED
A PIQUANT NOTION SUGGESTED BY LIPS
OF THAT TINT AND FORM
I CAN FANCY YOU THOUGH AT FORTY QUIETLY
DRESSED PALE AND SUNK BUT STILL WITH THAT STRAIGHT NOSE WHITE
FOREHEAD AND THOSE SOFT EYES
I SUPPOSE TOO YOU WILL KEEP YOUR VOICE
WHICH HAS ANOTHER 'TIMBRE' THAN THAT HARD DEEP ORGAN OF MISS MANN'S
COURAGE CARY EVEN AT FIFTY YOU WILL NOT BE REPULSIVE
MISS MANN DID NOT MAKE HERSELF OR TUNE HER VOICE ROBERT
NATURE MADE HER IN THE MOOD IN WHICH SHE MAKES HER BRIARS AND THORNS
WHEREAS FOR THE CREATION OF SOME WOMEN SHE RESERVES THE MAY MORNING
HOURS WHEN WITH LIGHT AND DEW SHE WOOES THE PRIMROSE FROM THE TURF AND
THE LILY FROM THE WOOD MOSS
USHERED INTO MISS MANN'S LITTLE PARLOUR CAROLINE FOUND HER AS SHE
ALWAYS FOUND HER SURROUNDED BY PERFECT NEATNESS CLEANLINESS AND
COMFORT AFTER ALL IS IT NOT A VIRTUE IN OLD MAIDS THAT SOLITUDE RARELY
MAKES THEM NEGLIGENT OR DISORDERLY NO DUST ON HER POLISHED FURNITURE
NONE ON HER CARPET FRESH FLOWERS IN THE VASE ON HER TABLE A BRIGHT
FIRE IN THE GRATE
SHE HERSELF SAT PRIMLY AND SOMEWHAT GRIMLY TIDY IN A
CUSHIONED ROCKING CHAIR HER HANDS BUSIED WITH SOME KNITTING
THIS WAS
HER FAVOURITE WORK AS IT REQUIRED THE LEAST EXERTION
SHE SCARCELY ROSE
AS CAROLINE ENTERED
TO AVOID EXCITEMENT WAS ONE OF MISS MANN'S AIMS IN
LIFE
SHE HAD BEEN COMPOSING HERSELF EVER SINCE SHE CAME DOWN IN THE
MORNING AND HAD JUST ATTAINED A CERTAIN LETHARGIC STATE OF TRANQUILLITY
WHEN THE VISITOR'S KNOCK AT THE DOOR STARTLED HER AND UNDID HER DAY'S
WORK
SHE WAS SCARCELY PLEASED THEREFORE TO SEE MISS HELSTONE
SHE
RECEIVED HER WITH RESERVE BADE HER BE SEATED WITH AUSTERITY AND WHEN
SHE GOT HER PLACED OPPOSITE SHE FIXED HER WITH HER EYE
THIS WAS NO ORDINARY DOOM TO BE FIXED WITH MISS MANN'S EYE
ROBERT
MOORE HAD UNDERGONE IT ONCE AND HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE
HE CONSIDERED IT QUITE EQUAL TO ANYTHING MEDUSA COULD DO
HE PROFESSED
TO DOUBT WHETHER SINCE THAT INFLICTION HIS FLESH HAD BEEN QUITE WHAT
IT WAS BEFORE WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOMETHING STONY IN ITS TEXTURE
THE
GAZE HAD HAD SUCH AN EFFECT ON HIM AS TO DRIVE HIM PROMPTLY FROM THE
APARTMENT AND HOUSE IT HAD EVEN SENT HIM STRAIGHTWAY UP TO THE RECTORY
WHERE HE HAD APPEARED IN CAROLINE'S PRESENCE WITH A VERY QUEER FACE AND
AMAZED HER BY DEMANDING A COUSINLY SALUTE ON THE SPOT TO RECTIFY A
DAMAGE THAT HAD BEEN DONE HIM
CERTAINLY MISS MANN HAD A FORMIDABLE EYE FOR ONE OF THE SOFTER SEX
IT
WAS PROMINENT AND SHOWED A GREAT DEAL OF THE WHITE AND LOOKED AS
STEADILY AS UNWINKINGLY AT YOU AS IF IT WERE A STEEL BALL SOLDERED IN
HER HEAD AND WHEN WHILE LOOKING SHE BEGAN TO TALK IN AN INDESCRIBABLY
DRY MONOTONOUS TONE A TONE WITHOUT VIBRATION OR INFLECTION YOU FELT
AS IF A GRAVEN IMAGE OF SOME BAD SPIRIT WERE ADDRESSING YOU
BUT IT WAS
ALL A FIGMENT OF FANCY A MATTER OF SURFACE
MISS MANN'S GOBLIN GRIMNESS
SCARCELY WENT DEEPER THAN THE ANGEL SWEETNESS OF HUNDREDS OF BEAUTIES
SHE WAS A PERFECTLY HONEST CONSCIENTIOUS WOMAN WHO HAD PERFORMED
DUTIES IN HER DAY FROM WHOSE SEVERE ANGUISH MANY A HUMAN PERI
GAZELLE EYED SILKEN TRESSED AND SILVER TONGUED WOULD HAVE SHRUNK
APPALLED
SHE HAD PASSED ALONE THROUGH PROTRACTED SCENES OF SUFFERING
EXERCISED RIGID SELF DENIAL MADE LARGE SACRIFICES OF TIME MONEY
HEALTH FOR THOSE WHO HAD REPAID HER ONLY BY INGRATITUDE AND NOW HER
MAIN ALMOST HER SOLE FAULT WAS THAT SHE WAS CENSORIOUS
CENSORIOUS SHE CERTAINLY WAS
CAROLINE HAD NOT SAT FIVE MINUTES ERE HER
HOSTESS STILL KEEPING HER UNDER THE SPELL OF THAT DREAD AND GORGON
GAZE BEGAN FLAYING ALIVE CERTAIN OF THE FAMILIES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
SHE WENT TO WORK AT THIS BUSINESS IN A SINGULARLY COOL DELIBERATE
MANNER LIKE SOME SURGEON PRACTISING WITH HIS SCALPEL ON A LIFELESS
SUBJECT
SHE MADE FEW DISTINCTIONS SHE ALLOWED SCARCELY ANY ONE TO BE
GOOD SHE DISSECTED IMPARTIALLY ALMOST ALL HER ACQUAINTANCE
IF HER
AUDITRESS VENTURED NOW AND THEN TO PUT IN A PALLIATIVE WORD SHE SET IT
ASIDE WITH A CERTAIN DISDAIN
STILL THOUGH THUS PITILESS IN MORAL
ANATOMY SHE WAS NO SCANDAL MONGER
SHE NEVER DISSEMINATED REALLY
MALIGNANT OR DANGEROUS REPORTS
IT WAS NOT HER HEART SO MUCH AS HER
TEMPER THAT WAS WRONG
CAROLINE MADE THIS DISCOVERY FOR THE FIRST TIME TO DAY AND MOVED
THEREBY TO REGRET DIVERS UNJUST JUDGMENTS SHE HAD MORE THAN ONCE PASSED
ON THE CRABBED OLD MAID SHE BEGAN TO TALK TO HER SOFTLY NOT IN
SYMPATHIZING WORDS BUT WITH A SYMPATHIZING VOICE
THE LONELINESS OF HER
CONDITION STRUCK HER VISITOR IN A NEW LIGHT AS DID ALSO THE CHARACTER
OF HER UGLINESS A BLOODLESS PALLOR OF COMPLEXION AND DEEPLY WORN LINES
OF FEATURE
THE GIRL PITIED THE SOLITARY AND AFFLICTED WOMAN HER LOOKS
TOLD WHAT SHE FELT
A SWEET COUNTENANCE IS NEVER SO SWEET AS WHEN THE
MOVED HEART ANIMATES IT WITH COMPASSIONATE TENDERNESS
MISS MANN SEEING
SUCH A COUNTENANCE RAISED TO HER WAS TOUCHED IN HER TURN
SHE
ACKNOWLEDGED HER SENSE OF THE INTEREST THUS UNEXPECTEDLY SHOWN IN HER
WHO USUALLY MET WITH ONLY COLDNESS AND RIDICULE BY REPLYING TO HER
CANDIDLY
COMMUNICATIVE ON HER OWN AFFAIRS SHE USUALLY WAS NOT BECAUSE
NO ONE CARED TO LISTEN TO HER BUT TO DAY SHE BECAME SO AND HER
CONFIDANTE SHED TEARS AS SHE HEARD HER SPEAK FOR SHE TOLD OF CRUEL
SLOW WASTING OBSTINATE SUFFERINGS
WELL MIGHT SHE BE CORPSE LIKE WELL
MIGHT SHE LOOK GRIM AND NEVER SMILE WELL MIGHT SHE WISH TO AVOID
EXCITEMENT TO GAIN AND RETAIN COMPOSURE CAROLINE WHEN SHE KNEW ALL
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MISS MANN WAS RATHER TO BE ADMIRED FOR FORTITUDE THAN
BLAMED FOR MOROSENESS
READER WHEN YOU BEHOLD AN ASPECT FOR WHOSE
CONSTANT GLOOM AND FROWN YOU CANNOT ACCOUNT WHOSE UNVARYING CLOUD
EXASPERATES YOU BY ITS APPARENT CAUSELESSNESS BE SURE THAT THERE IS A
CANKER SOMEWHERE AND A CANKER NOT THE LESS DEEPLY CORRODING BECAUSE
CONCEALED
MISS MANN FELT THAT SHE WAS UNDERSTOOD PARTLY AND WISHED TO BE
UNDERSTOOD FURTHER FOR HOWEVER OLD PLAIN HUMBLE DESOLATE AFFLICTED
WE MAY BE SO LONG AS OUR HEARTS PRESERVE THE FEEBLEST SPARK OF LIFE
THEY PRESERVE ALSO SHIVERING NEAR THAT PALE EMBER A STARVED GHOSTLY
LONGING FOR APPRECIATION AND AFFECTION
TO THIS EXTENUATED SPECTRE
PERHAPS A CRUMB IS NOT THROWN ONCE A YEAR BUT WHEN AHUNGERED AND
ATHIRST TO FAMINE WHEN ALL HUMANITY HAS FORGOTTEN THE DYING TENANT OF A
DECAYING HOUSE DIVINE MERCY REMEMBERS THE MOURNER AND A SHOWER OF
MANNA FALLS FOR LIPS THAT EARTHLY NUTRIMENT IS TO PASS NO MORE
BIBLICAL
PROMISES HEARD FIRST IN HEALTH BUT THEN UNHEEDED COME WHISPERING TO
THE COUCH OF SICKNESS IT IS FELT THAT A PITYING GOD WATCHES WHAT ALL
MANKIND HAVE FORSAKEN
THE TENDER COMPASSION OF JESUS IS RECALLED AND
RELIED ON THE FADED EYE GAZING BEYOND TIME SEES A HOME A FRIEND A
REFUGE IN ETERNITY
MISS MANN DRAWN ON BY THE STILL ATTENTION OF HER LISTENER PROCEEDED TO
ALLUDE TO CIRCUMSTANCES IN HER PAST LIFE
SHE SPOKE LIKE ONE WHO TELLS
THE TRUTH SIMPLY AND WITH A CERTAIN RESERVE SHE DID NOT BOAST NOR
DID SHE EXAGGERATE
CAROLINE FOUND THAT THE OLD MAID HAD BEEN A MOST
DEVOTED DAUGHTER AND SISTER AN UNWEARIED WATCHER BY LINGERING
DEATHBEDS THAT TO PROLONGED AND UNRELAXING ATTENDANCE ON THE SICK THE
MALADY THAT NOW POISONED HER OWN LIFE OWED ITS ORIGIN THAT TO ONE
WRETCHED RELATIVE SHE HAD BEEN A SUPPORT AND SUCCOUR IN THE DEPTHS OF
SELF EARNED DEGRADATION AND THAT IT WAS STILL HER HAND WHICH KEPT HIM
FROM UTTER DESTITUTION
MISS HELSTONE STAYED THE WHOLE EVENING OMITTING
TO PAY HER OTHER INTENDED VISIT AND WHEN SHE LEFT MISS MANN IT WAS WITH
THE DETERMINATION TO TRY IN FUTURE TO EXCUSE HER FAULTS NEVER AGAIN TO
MAKE LIGHT OF HER PECULIARITIES OR TO LAUGH AT HER PLAINNESS AND ABOVE
ALL THINGS NOT TO NEGLECT HER BUT TO COME ONCE A WEEK AND TO OFFER
HER FROM ONE HUMAN HEART AT LEAST THE HOMAGE OF AFFECTION AND RESPECT
SHE FELT SHE COULD NOW SINCERELY GIVE HER A SMALL TRIBUTE OF EACH
FEELING
CAROLINE ON HER RETURN TOLD FANNY SHE WAS VERY GLAD SHE HAD GONE OUT
AS SHE FELT MUCH BETTER FOR THE VISIT
THE NEXT DAY SHE FAILED NOT TO
SEEK MISS AINLEY
THIS LADY WAS IN NARROWER CIRCUMSTANCES THAN MISS
MANN AND HER DWELLING WAS MORE HUMBLE
IT WAS HOWEVER IF POSSIBLE
YET MORE EXQUISITELY CLEAN THOUGH THE DECAYED GENTLEWOMAN COULD NOT
AFFORD TO KEEP A SERVANT BUT WAITED ON HERSELF AND HAD ONLY THE
OCCASIONAL ASSISTANCE OF A LITTLE GIRL WHO LIVED IN A COTTAGE NEAR
NOT ONLY WAS MISS AINLEY POORER BUT SHE WAS EVEN PLAINER THAN THE OTHER
OLD MAID
IN HER FIRST YOUTH SHE MUST HAVE BEEN UGLY NOW AT THE AGE OF
FIFTY SHE WAS VERY UGLY
AT FIRST SIGHT ALL BUT PECULIARLY
WELL DISCIPLINED MINDS WERE APT TO TURN FROM HER WITH ANNOYANCE TO
CONCEIVE AGAINST HER A PREJUDICE SIMPLY ON THE GROUND OF HER
UNATTRACTIVE LOOK
THEN SHE WAS PRIM IN DRESS AND MANNER SHE LOOKED
SPOKE AND MOVED THE COMPLETE OLD MAID
HER WELCOME TO CAROLINE WAS FORMAL EVEN IN ITS KINDNESS FOR IT WAS
KIND BUT MISS HELSTONE EXCUSED THIS
SHE KNEW SOMETHING OF THE
BENEVOLENCE OF THE HEART WHICH BEAT UNDER THAT STARCHED KERCHIEF ALL
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AT LEAST ALL THE FEMALE NEIGHBOURHOOD KNEW SOMETHING
OF IT
NO ONE SPOKE AGAINST MISS AINLEY EXCEPT LIVELY YOUNG GENTLEMEN
AND INCONSIDERATE OLD ONES WHO DECLARED HER HIDEOUS
CAROLINE WAS SOON AT HOME IN THAT TINY PARLOUR
A KIND HAND TOOK FROM
HER HER SHAWL AND BONNET AND INSTALLED HER IN THE MOST COMFORTABLE SEAT
NEAR THE FIRE
THE YOUNG AND THE ANTIQUATED WOMAN WERE PRESENTLY DEEP IN
KINDLY CONVERSATION AND SOON CAROLINE BECAME AWARE OF THE POWER A MOST
SERENE UNSELFISH AND BENIGNANT MIND COULD EXERCISE OVER THOSE TO WHOM
IT WAS DEVELOPED
SHE TALKED NEVER OF HERSELF ALWAYS OF OTHERS
THEIR
FAULTS SHE PASSED OVER
HER THEME WAS THEIR WANTS WHICH SHE SOUGHT TO
SUPPLY THEIR SUFFERINGS WHICH SHE LONGED TO ALLEVIATE
SHE WAS
RELIGIOUS A PROFESSOR OF RELIGION WHAT SOME WOULD CALL A SAINT AND
SHE REFERRED TO RELIGION OFTEN IN SANCTIONED PHRASE IN PHRASE WHICH
THOSE WHO POSSESS A PERCEPTION OF THE RIDICULOUS WITHOUT OWNING THE
POWER OF EXACTLY TESTING AND TRULY JUDGING CHARACTER WOULD CERTAINLY
HAVE ESTEEMED A PROPER SUBJECT FOR SATIRE A MATTER FOR MIMICRY AND
LAUGHTER
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HUGELY MISTAKEN FOR THEIR PAINS
SINCERITY IS NEVER LUDICROUS IT IS ALWAYS RESPECTABLE
WHETHER
TRUTH BE IT RELIGIOUS OR MORAL TRUTH SPEAK ELOQUENTLY AND IN
WELL CHOSEN LANGUAGE OR NOT ITS VOICE SHOULD BE HEARD WITH REVERENCE
LET THOSE WHO CANNOT NICELY AND WITH CERTAINTY DISCERN THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE TONES OF HYPOCRISY AND THOSE OF SINCERITY NEVER PRESUME TO
LAUGH AT ALL LEST THEY SHOULD HAVE THE MISERABLE MISFORTUNE TO LAUGH IN
THE WRONG PLACE AND COMMIT IMPIETY WHEN THEY THINK THEY ARE ACHIEVING
WIT
NOT FROM MISS AINLEY'S OWN LIPS DID CAROLINE HEAR OF HER GOOD WORKS BUT
SHE KNEW MUCH OF THEM NEVERTHELESS
HER BENEFICENCE WAS THE FAMILIAR
TOPIC OF THE POOR IN BRIARFIELD
THEY WERE NOT WORKS OF ALMSGIVING
THE
OLD MAID WAS TOO POOR TO GIVE MUCH THOUGH SHE STRAITENED HERSELF TO
PRIVATION THAT SHE MIGHT CONTRIBUTE HER MITE WHEN NEEDFUL
THEY WERE THE
WORKS OF A SISTER OF CHARITY FAR MORE DIFFICULT TO PERFORM THAN THOSE
OF A LADY BOUNTIFUL
SHE WOULD WATCH BY ANY SICK BED SHE SEEMED TO FEAR
NO DISEASE
SHE WOULD NURSE THE POOREST WHOM NONE ELSE WOULD NURSE
SHE
WAS SERENE HUMBLE KIND AND EQUABLE THROUGH EVERYTHING
FOR THIS GOODNESS SHE GOT BUT LITTLE REWARD IN THIS LIFE
MANY OF THE
POOR BECAME SO ACCUSTOMED TO HER SERVICES THAT THEY HARDLY THANKED HER
FOR THEM
THE RICH HEARD THEM MENTIONED WITH WONDER BUT WERE SILENT
FROM A SENSE OF SHAME AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER SACRIFICES AND THEIR
OWN
MANY LADIES HOWEVER RESPECTED HER DEEPLY
THEY COULD NOT HELP IT
ONE GENTLEMAN ONE ONLY GAVE HER HIS FRIENDSHIP AND PERFECT CONFIDENCE
THIS WAS MR
HALL THE VICAR OF NUNNELY
HE SAID AND SAID TRULY THAT
HER LIFE CAME NEARER THE LIFE OF CHRIST THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER HUMAN
BEING HE HAD EVER MET WITH
YOU MUST NOT THINK READER THAT ILL
SKETCHING MISS AINLEY'S CHARACTER I DEPICT A FIGMENT OF IMAGINATION
NO
WE SEEK THE ORIGINALS OF SUCH PORTRAITS IN REAL LIFE ONLY
MISS HELSTONE STUDIED WELL THE MIND AND HEART NOW REVEALED TO HER
SHE
FOUND NO HIGH INTELLECT TO ADMIRE THE OLD MAID WAS MERELY SENSIBLE BUT
SHE DISCOVERED SO MUCH GOODNESS SO MUCH USEFULNESS SO MUCH MILDNESS
PATIENCE TRUTH THAT SHE BENT HER OWN MIND BEFORE MISS AINLEY'S IN
REVERENCE
WHAT WAS HER LOVE OF NATURE WHAT WAS HER SENSE OF BEAUTY
WHAT WERE HER MORE VARIED AND FERVENT EMOTIONS WHAT WAS HER DEEPER
POWER OF THOUGHT WHAT HER WIDER CAPACITY TO COMPREHEND COMPARED TO THE
PRACTICAL EXCELLENCE OF THIS GOOD WOMAN MOMENTLY THEY SEEMED ONLY
BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF SELFISH DELIGHT MENTALLY SHE TROD THEM UNDER FOOT
IT IS TRUE SHE STILL FELT WITH PAIN THAT THE LIFE WHICH MADE MISS AINLEY
HAPPY COULD NOT MAKE HER HAPPY
PURE AND ACTIVE AS IT WAS IN HER HEART
SHE DEEMED IT DEEPLY DREARY BECAUSE IT WAS SO LOVELESS TO HER IDEAS
SO FORLORN
YET DOUBTLESS SHE REFLECTED IT NEEDED ONLY HABIT TO MAKE
IT PRACTICABLE AND AGREEABLE TO ANY ONE
IT WAS DESPICABLE SHE FELT TO
PINE SENTIMENTALLY TO CHERISH SECRET GRIEFS VAIN MEMORIES TO BE
INERT TO WASTE YOUTH IN ACHING LANGUOR TO GROW OLD DOING NOTHING
I WILL BESTIR MYSELF WAS HER RESOLUTION AND TRY TO BE WISE IF I
CANNOT BE GOOD
SHE PROCEEDED TO MAKE INQUIRY OF MISS AINLEY IF SHE COULD HELP HER IN
ANYTHING
MISS AINLEY GLAD OF AN ASSISTANT TOLD HER THAT SHE COULD
AND INDICATED SOME POOR FAMILIES IN BRIARFIELD THAT IT WAS DESIRABLE SHE
SHOULD VISIT GIVING HER LIKEWISE AT HER FURTHER REQUEST SOME WORK TO
DO FOR CERTAIN POOR WOMEN WHO HAD MANY CHILDREN AND WHO WERE UNSKILLED
IN USING THE NEEDLE FOR THEMSELVES
CAROLINE WENT HOME LAID HER PLANS AND TOOK A RESOLVE NOT TO SWERVE
FROM THEM
SHE ALLOTTED A CERTAIN PORTION OF HER TIME FOR HER VARIOUS
STUDIES AND A CERTAIN PORTION FOR DOING ANYTHING MISS AINLEY MIGHT
DIRECT HER TO DO
THE REMAINDER WAS TO BE SPENT IN EXERCISE NOT A
MOMENT WAS TO BE LEFT FOR THE INDULGENCE OF SUCH FEVERED THOUGHTS AS HAD
POISONED LAST SUNDAY EVENING
TO DO HER JUSTICE SHE EXECUTED HER PLANS CONSCIENTIOUSLY
PERSEVERINGLY
IT WAS VERY HARD WORK AT FIRST IT WAS EVEN HARD WORK TO
THE END BUT IT HELPED HER TO STEM AND KEEP DOWN ANGUISH IT FORCED HER
TO BE EMPLOYED IT FORBADE HER TO BROOD AND GLEAMS OF SATISFACTION
CHEQUERED HER GRAY LIFE HERE AND THERE WHEN SHE FOUND SHE HAD DONE GOOD
IMPARTED PLEASURE OR ALLAYED SUFFERING
YET I MUST SPEAK TRUTH
THESE EFFORTS BROUGHT HER NEITHER HEALTH OF BODY
NOR CONTINUED PEACE OF MIND
WITH THEM ALL SHE WASTED GREW MORE JOYLESS
AND MORE WAN WITH THEM ALL HER MEMORY KEPT HARPING ON THE NAME OF
ROBERT MOORE AN ELEGY OVER THE PAST STILL RUNG CONSTANTLY IN HER EAR A
FUNEREAL INWARD CRY HAUNTED AND HARASSED HER THE HEAVINESS OF A BROKEN
SPIRIT AND OF PINING AND PALSYING FACULTIES SETTLED SLOW ON HER
BUOYANT YOUTH
WINTER SEEMED CONQUERING HER SPRING THE MIND'S SOIL AND
ITS TREASURES WERE FREEZING GRADUALLY TO BARREN STAGNATION
CHAPTER XI
FIELDHEAD
YET CAROLINE REFUSED TAMELY TO SUCCUMB
SHE HAD NATIVE STRENGTH IN HER
GIRL'S HEART AND SHE USED IT
MEN AND WOMEN NEVER STRUGGLE SO HARD AS
WHEN THEY STRUGGLE ALONE WITHOUT WITNESS COUNSELLOR OR CONFIDANT
UNENCOURAGED UNADVISED AND UNPITIED
MISS HELSTONE WAS IN THIS POSITION
HER SUFFERINGS WERE HER ONLY SPUR
AND BEING VERY REAL AND SHARP THEY ROUSED HER SPIRIT KEENLY
BENT ON
VICTORY OVER A MORTAL PAIN SHE DID HER BEST TO QUELL IT
NEVER HAD SHE
BEEN SEEN SO BUSY SO STUDIOUS AND ABOVE ALL SO ACTIVE
SHE TOOK
WALKS IN ALL WEATHERS LONG WALKS IN SOLITARY DIRECTIONS
DAY BY DAY SHE
CAME BACK IN THE EVENING PALE AND WEARIED LOOKING YET SEEMINGLY NOT
FATIGUED FOR STILL AS SOON AS SHE HAD THROWN OFF HER BONNET AND SHAWL
SHE WOULD INSTEAD OF RESTING BEGIN TO PACE HER APARTMENT
SOMETIMES
SHE WOULD NOT SIT DOWN TILL SHE WAS LITERALLY FAINT
SHE SAID SHE DID
THIS TO TIRE HERSELF WELL THAT SHE MIGHT SLEEP SOUNDLY AT NIGHT
BUT IF
THAT WAS HER AIM IT WAS UNATTAINED FOR AT NIGHT WHEN OTHERS SLUMBERED
SHE WAS TOSSING ON HER PILLOW OR SITTING AT THE FOOT OF HER COUCH IN
THE DARKNESS FORGETFUL APPARENTLY OF THE NECESSITY OF SEEKING REPOSE
OFTEN UNHAPPY GIRL SHE WAS CRYING CRYING IN A SORT OF INTOLERABLE
DESPAIR WHICH WHEN IT RUSHED OVER HER SMOTE DOWN HER STRENGTH AND
REDUCED HER TO CHILDLIKE HELPLESSNESS
WHEN THUS PROSTRATE TEMPTATIONS BESIEGED HER
WEAK SUGGESTIONS
WHISPERED IN HER WEARY HEART TO WRITE TO ROBERT AND SAY THAT SHE WAS
UNHAPPY BECAUSE SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO SEE HIM AND HORTENSE AND THAT SHE
FEARED HE WOULD WITHDRAW HIS FRIENDSHIP NOT LOVE FROM HER AND FORGET
HER ENTIRELY AND BEGGING HIM TO REMEMBER HER AND SOMETIMES TO WRITE TO
HER
ONE OR TWO SUCH LETTERS SHE ACTUALLY INDITED BUT SHE NEVER SENT
THEM SHAME AND GOOD SENSE FORBADE
AT LAST THE LIFE SHE LED REACHED THE POINT WHEN IT SEEMED SHE COULD BEAR
IT NO LONGER THAT SHE MUST SEEK AND FIND A CHANGE SOMEHOW OR HER HEART
AND HEAD WOULD FAIL UNDER THE PRESSURE WHICH STRAINED THEM
SHE LONGED
TO LEAVE BRIARFIELD TO GO TO SOME VERY DISTANT PLACE
SHE LONGED FOR
SOMETHING ELSE THE DEEP SECRET ANXIOUS YEARNING TO DISCOVER AND KNOW
HER MOTHER STRENGTHENED DAILY BUT WITH THE DESIRE WAS COUPLED A DOUBT
A DREAD IF SHE KNEW HER COULD SHE LOVE HER THERE WAS CAUSE FOR
HESITATION FOR APPREHENSION ON THIS POINT
NEVER IN HER LIFE HAD SHE
HEARD THAT MOTHER PRAISED WHOEVER MENTIONED HER MENTIONED HER COOLLY
HER UNCLE SEEMED TO REGARD HIS SISTER IN LAW WITH A SORT OF TACIT
ANTIPATHY AN OLD SERVANT WHO HAD LIVED WITH MRS
JAMES HELSTONE FOR A
SHORT TIME AFTER HER MARRIAGE WHENEVER SHE REFERRED TO HER FORMER
MISTRESS SPOKE WITH CHILLING RESERVE SOMETIMES SHE CALLED HER QUEER
SOMETIMES SHE SAID SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER
THESE EXPRESSIONS WERE
ICE TO THE DAUGHTER'S HEART THEY SUGGESTED THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS
PERHAPS BETTER NEVER TO KNOW HER PARENT THAN TO KNOW HER AND NOT LIKE
HER
BUT ONE PROJECT COULD SHE FRAME WHOSE EXECUTION SEEMED LIKELY TO BRING
HER A HOPE OF RELIEF IT WAS TO TAKE A SITUATION TO BE A GOVERNESS SHE
COULD DO NOTHING ELSE
A LITTLE INCIDENT BROUGHT HER TO THE POINT WHEN
SHE FOUND COURAGE TO BREAK HER DESIGN TO HER UNCLE
HER LONG AND LATE WALKS LAY ALWAYS AS HAS BEEN SAID ON LONELY ROADS
BUT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE HAD RAMBLED WHETHER ALONG THE DREAR
SKIRTS OF STILBRO' MOOR OR OVER THE SUNNY STRETCH OF NUNNELY COMMON HER
HOMEWARD PATH WAS STILL SO CONTRIVED AS TO LEAD HER NEAR THE HOLLOW
SHE
RARELY DESCENDED THE DEN BUT SHE VISITED ITS BRINK AT TWILIGHT ALMOST
AS REGULARLY AS THE STARS ROSE OVER THE HILLCRESTS
HER RESTING PLACE
WAS AT A CERTAIN STILE UNDER A CERTAIN OLD THORN
THENCE SHE COULD LOOK
DOWN ON THE COTTAGE THE MILL THE DEWY GARDEN GROUND THE STILL DEEP
DAM THENCE WAS VISIBLE THE WELL KNOWN COUNTING HOUSE WINDOW FROM WHOSE
PANES AT A FIXED HOUR SHOT SUDDENLY BRIGHT THE RAY OF THE WELL KNOWN
LAMP
HER ERRAND WAS TO WATCH FOR THIS RAY HER REWARD TO CATCH IT
SOMETIMES SPARKLING BRIGHT IN CLEAR AIR SOMETIMES SHIMMERING DIM
THROUGH MIST AND ANON FLASHING BROKEN BETWEEN SLANT LINES OF RAIN FOR
SHE CAME IN ALL WEATHERS
THERE WERE NIGHTS WHEN IT FAILED TO APPEAR
SHE KNEW THEN THAT ROBERT
WAS FROM HOME AND WENT AWAY DOUBLY SAD WHEREAS ITS KINDLING RENDERED
HER ELATE AS THOUGH SHE SAW IN IT THE PROMISE OF SOME INDEFINITE HOPE
IF WHILE SHE GAZED A SHADOW BENT BETWEEN THE LIGHT AND LATTICE HER
HEART LEAPED
THAT ECLIPSE WAS ROBERT SHE HAD SEEN HIM
SHE WOULD
RETURN HOME COMFORTED CARRYING IN HER MIND A CLEARER VISION OF HIS
ASPECT A DISTINCTER RECOLLECTION OF HIS VOICE HIS SMILE HIS BEARING
AND BLENT WITH THESE IMPRESSIONS WAS OFTEN A SWEET PERSUASION THAT IF
SHE COULD GET NEAR HIM HIS HEART MIGHT WELCOME HER PRESENCE YET THAT
AT THIS MOMENT HE MIGHT BE WILLING TO EXTEND HIS HAND AND DRAW HER TO
HIM AND SHELTER HER AT HIS SIDE AS HE USED TO DO
THAT NIGHT THOUGH
SHE MIGHT WEEP AS USUAL SHE WOULD FANCY HER TEARS LESS SCALDING THE
PILLOW THEY WATERED SEEMED A LITTLE SOFTER THE TEMPLES PRESSED TO THAT
PILLOW ACHED LESS
THE SHORTEST PATH FROM THE HOLLOW TO THE RECTORY WOUND NEAR A CERTAIN
MANSION THE SAME UNDER WHOSE LONE WALLS MALONE PASSED ON THAT
NIGHT JOURNEY MENTIONED IN AN EARLY CHAPTER OF THIS WORK THE OLD AND
TENANTLESS DWELLING YCLEPT FIELDHEAD
TENANTLESS BY THE PROPRIETOR IT
HAD BEEN FOR TEN YEARS BUT IT WAS NO RUIN
MR
YORKE HAD SEEN IT KEPT
IN GOOD REPAIR AND AN OLD GARDENER AND HIS WIFE HAD LIVED IN IT
CULTIVATED THE GROUNDS AND MAINTAINED THE HOUSE IN HABITABLE CONDITION
IF FIELDHEAD HAD FEW OTHER MERITS AS A BUILDING IT MIGHT AT LEAST BE
TERMED PICTURESQUE
ITS REGULAR ARCHITECTURE AND THE GRAY AND MOSSY
COLOURING COMMUNICATED BY TIME GAVE IT A JUST CLAIM TO THIS EPITHET
THE OLD LATTICED WINDOWS THE STONE PORCH THE WALLS THE ROOF THE
CHIMNEY STACKS WERE RICH IN CRAYON TOUCHES AND SEPIA LIGHTS AND SHADES
THE TREES BEHIND WERE FINE BOLD AND SPREADING THE CEDAR ON THE LAWN
IN FRONT WAS GRAND AND THE GRANITE URNS ON THE GARDEN WALL THE FRETTED
ARCH OF THE GATEWAY WERE FOR AN ARTIST AS THE VERY DESIRE OF THE EYE
ONE MILD MAY EVENING CAROLINE PASSING NEAR ABOUT MOONRISE AND FEELING
THOUGH WEARY UNWILLING YET TO GO HOME WHERE THERE WAS ONLY THE BED OF
THORNS AND THE NIGHT OF GRIEF TO ANTICIPATE SAT DOWN ON THE MOSSY
GROUND NEAR THE GATE AND GAZED THROUGH TOWARDS CEDAR AND MANSION
IT
WAS A STILL NIGHT CALM DEWY CLOUDLESS THE GABLES TURNED TO THE
WEST REFLECTED THE CLEAR AMBER OF THE HORIZON THEY FACED THE OAKS
BEHIND WERE BLACK THE CEDAR WAS BLACKER
UNDER ITS DENSE RAVEN BOUGHS
A GLIMPSE OF SKY OPENED GRAVELY BLUE
IT WAS FULL OF THE MOON WHICH
LOOKED SOLEMNLY AND MILDLY DOWN ON CAROLINE FROM BENEATH THAT SOMBRE
CANOPY
SHE FELT THIS NIGHT AND PROSPECT MOURNFULLY LOVELY
SHE WISHED SHE COULD
BE HAPPY SHE WISHED SHE COULD KNOW INWARD PEACE SHE WONDERED
PROVIDENCE HAD NO PITY ON HER AND WOULD NOT HELP OR CONSOLE HER
RECOLLECTIONS OF HAPPY TRYSTS OF LOVERS COMMEMORATED IN OLD BALLADS
RETURNED ON HER MIND SHE THOUGHT SUCH TRYST IN SUCH SCENE WOULD BE
BLISSFUL
WHERE NOW WAS ROBERT SHE ASKED
NOT AT THE HOLLOW SHE HAD
WATCHED FOR HIS LAMP LONG AND HAD NOT SEEN IT
SHE QUESTIONED WITHIN
HERSELF WHETHER SHE AND MOORE WERE EVER DESTINED TO MEET AND SPEAK
AGAIN
SUDDENLY THE DOOR WITHIN THE STONE PORCH OF THE HALL OPENED AND
TWO MEN CAME OUT ONE ELDERLY AND WHITE HEADED THE OTHER YOUNG
DARK HAIRED AND TALL
THEY PASSED ACROSS THE LAWN OUT THROUGH A PORTAL
IN THE GARDEN WALL
CAROLINE SAW THEM CROSS THE ROAD PASS THE STILE
DESCEND THE FIELDS SHE SAW THEM DISAPPEAR
ROBERT MOORE HAD PASSED
BEFORE HER WITH HIS FRIEND MR
YORKE
NEITHER HAD SEEN HER
THE APPARITION HAD BEEN TRANSIENT SCARCE SEEN ERE GONE BUT ITS
ELECTRIC PASSAGE LEFT HER VEINS KINDLED HER SOUL INSURGENT
IT FOUND
HER DESPAIRING IT LEFT HER DESPERATE TWO DIFFERENT STATES
OH HAD HE BUT BEEN ALONE HAD HE BUT SEEN ME WAS HER CRY
HE WOULD
HAVE SAID SOMETHING
HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME HIS HAND
HE DOES HE
MUST LOVE ME A LITTLE
HE WOULD HAVE SHOWN SOME TOKEN OF AFFECTION
IN HIS EYE ON HIS LIPS I SHOULD HAVE READ COMFORT BUT THE CHANCE IS
LOST
THE WIND THE CLOUD'S SHADOW DOES NOT PASS MORE SILENTLY MORE
EMPTILY THAN HE
I HAVE BEEN MOCKED AND HEAVEN IS CRUEL
THUS IN THE UTTER SICKNESS OF LONGING AND DISAPPOINTMENT SHE WENT
HOME
THE NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST WHERE SHE APPEARED WHITE CHEEKED AND
MISERABLE LOOKING AS ONE WHO HAD SEEN A GHOST SHE INQUIRED OF MR
HELSTONE HAVE YOU ANY OBJECTION UNCLE TO MY INQUIRING FOR A
SITUATION IN A FAMILY
HER UNCLE IGNORANT AS THE TABLE SUPPORTING HIS COFFEE CUP OF ALL HIS
NIECE HAD UNDERGONE AND WAS UNDERGOING SCARCELY BELIEVED HIS EARS
WHAT WHIM NOW HE ASKED
ARE YOU BEWITCHED WHAT CAN YOU MEAN
I AM NOT WELL AND NEED A CHANGE SHE SAID
HE EXAMINED HER
HE DISCOVERED SHE HAD EXPERIENCED A CHANGE AT ANY
RATE
WITHOUT HIS BEING AWARE OF IT THE ROSE HAD DWINDLED AND FADED TO
A MERE SNOWDROP BLOOM HAD VANISHED FLESH WASTED SHE SAT BEFORE HIM
DROOPING COLOURLESS AND THIN
BUT FOR THE SOFT EXPRESSION OF HER BROWN
EYES THE DELICATE LINES OF HER FEATURES AND THE FLOWING ABUNDANCE OF
HER HAIR SHE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE POSSESSED A CLAIM TO THE EPITHET
PRETTY
WHAT ON EARTH IS THE MATTER WITH YOU HE ASKED
WHAT IS WRONG HOW
ARE YOU AILING
NO ANSWER ONLY THE BROWN EYES FILLED THE FAINTLY TINTED LIPS TREMBLED
LOOK OUT FOR A SITUATION INDEED FOR WHAT SITUATION ARE YOU FIT WHAT
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WITH YOURSELF YOU ARE NOT WELL
I SHOULD BE WELL IF I WENT FROM HOME
THESE WOMEN ARE INCOMPREHENSIBLE
THEY HAVE THE STRANGEST KNACK OF
STARTLING YOU WITH UNPLEASANT SURPRISES
TO DAY YOU SEE THEM BOUNCING
BUXOM RED AS CHERRIES AND ROUND AS APPLES TO MORROW THEY EXHIBIT
THEMSELVES EFFETE AS DEAD WEEDS BLANCHED AND BROKEN DOWN
AND THE
REASON OF IT ALL THAT'S THE PUZZLE
SHE HAS HER MEALS HER LIBERTY A
GOOD HOUSE TO LIVE IN AND GOOD CLOTHES TO WEAR AS USUAL
A WHILE SINCE
THAT SUFFICED TO KEEP HER HANDSOME AND CHEERY AND THERE SHE SITS NOW A
POOR LITTLE PALE PULING CHIT ENOUGH
PROVOKING THEN COMES THE
QUESTION WHAT IS TO BE DONE I SUPPOSE I MUST SEND FOR ADVICE
WILL YOU
HAVE A DOCTOR CHILD
NO UNCLE I DON'T WANT ONE
A DOCTOR COULD DO ME NO GOOD
I MERELY
WANT CHANGE OF AIR AND SCENE
WELL IF THAT BE THE CAPRICE IT SHALL BE GRATIFIED
YOU SHALL GO TO A
WATERING PLACE
I DON'T MIND THE EXPENSE
FANNY SHALL ACCOMPANY YOU
BUT UNCLE SOME DAY I MUST DO SOMETHING FOR MYSELF I HAVE NO FORTUNE
I HAD BETTER BEGIN NOW
WHILE I LIVE YOU SHALL NOT TURN OUT AS A GOVERNESS CAROLINE
I WILL
NOT HAVE IT SAID THAT MY NIECE IS A GOVERNESS
BUT THE LATER IN LIFE ONE MAKES A CHANGE OF THAT SORT UNCLE THE MORE
DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL IT IS
I SHOULD WISH TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO THE YOKE
BEFORE ANY HABITS OF EASE AND INDEPENDENCE ARE FORMED
I BEG YOU WILL NOT HARASS ME CAROLINE
I MEAN TO PROVIDE FOR YOU
I
HAVE ALWAYS MEANT TO PROVIDE FOR YOU
I WILL PURCHASE AN ANNUITY
BLESS
ME I AM BUT FIFTY FIVE MY HEALTH AND CONSTITUTION ARE EXCELLENT
THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME TO SAVE AND TAKE MEASURES
DON'T MAKE YOURSELF
ANXIOUS RESPECTING THE FUTURE
IS THAT WHAT FRETS YOU
NO UNCLE BUT I LONG FOR A CHANGE
HE LAUGHED
THERE SPEAKS THE WOMAN CRIED HE THE VERY WOMAN A
CHANGE A CHANGE ALWAYS FANTASTICAL AND WHIMSICAL WELL IT'S IN HER
SEX
BUT IT IS NOT FANTASY AND WHIM UNCLE
WHAT IS IT THEN
NECESSITY I THINK
I FEEL WEAKER THAN FORMERLY
I BELIEVE I SHOULD
HAVE MORE TO DO
ADMIRABLE SHE FEELS WEAK AND THEREFORE SHE SHOULD BE SET TO HARD
LABOUR 'CLAIR COMME LE JOUR AS MOORE CONFOUND MOORE YOU SHALL GO TO
CLIFF BRIDGE AND THERE ARE TWO GUINEAS TO BUY A NEW FROCK
COME CARY
NEVER FEAR
WE'LL FIND BALM IN GILEAD
UNCLE I WISH YOU WERE LESS GENEROUS AND MORE
MORE WHAT
SYMPATHIZING WAS THE WORD ON CAROLINE'S LIPS BUT IT WAS NOT UTTERED
SHE CHECKED HERSELF IN TIME
HER UNCLE WOULD INDEED HAVE LAUGHED IF THAT
NAMBY PAMBY WORD HAD ESCAPED HER
FINDING HER SILENT HE SAID THE FACT
IS YOU DON'T KNOW PRECISELY WHAT YOU WANT
ONLY TO BE A GOVERNESS
POOH MERE NONSENSE I'LL NOT HEAR OF GOVERNESSING
DON'T MENTION IT
AGAIN
IT IS RATHER TOO FEMININE A FANCY
I HAVE FINISHED BREAKFAST
RING THE BELL
PUT ALL CROTCHETS OUT OF YOUR HEAD AND RUN AWAY AND
AMUSE YOURSELF
WHAT WITH MY DOLL ASKED CAROLINE TO HERSELF AS SHE QUITTED THE ROOM
A WEEK OR TWO PASSED HER BODILY AND MENTAL HEALTH NEITHER GREW WORSE
NOR BETTER
SHE WAS NOW PRECISELY IN THAT STATE WHEN IF HER
CONSTITUTION HAD CONTAINED THE SEEDS OF CONSUMPTION DECLINE OR SLOW
FEVER THOSE DISEASES WOULD HAVE BEEN RAPIDLY DEVELOPED AND WOULD SOON
HAVE CARRIED HER QUIETLY FROM THE WORLD
PEOPLE NEVER DIE OF LOVE OR
GRIEF ALONE THOUGH SOME DIE OF INHERENT MALADIES WHICH THE TORTURES OF
THOSE PASSIONS PREMATURELY FORCE INTO DESTRUCTIVE ACTION
THE SOUND BY
NATURE UNDERGO THESE TORTURES AND ARE RACKED SHAKEN SHATTERED THEIR
BEAUTY AND BLOOM PERISH BUT LIFE REMAINS UNTOUCHED
THEY ARE BROUGHT TO
A CERTAIN POINT OF DILAPIDATION THEY ARE REDUCED TO PALLOR DEBILITY
AND EMACIATION
PEOPLE THINK AS THEY SEE THEM GLIDING LANGUIDLY ABOUT
THAT THEY WILL SOON WITHDRAW TO SICK BEDS PERISH THERE AND CEASE FROM
AMONG THE HEALTHY AND HAPPY
THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN
THEY LIVE ON AND
THOUGH THEY CANNOT REGAIN YOUTH AND GAIETY THEY MAY REGAIN STRENGTH AND
SERENITY
THE BLOSSOM WHICH THE MARCH WIND NIPS BUT FAILS TO SWEEP
AWAY MAY SURVIVE TO HANG A WITHERED APPLE ON THE TREE LATE INTO AUTUMN
HAVING BRAVED THE LAST FROSTS OF SPRING IT MAY ALSO BRAVE THE FIRST OF
WINTER
EVERY ONE NOTICED THE CHANGE IN MISS HELSTONE'S APPEARANCE AND MOST
PEOPLE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO DIE
SHE NEVER THOUGHT SO HERSELF
SHE FELT
IN NO DYING CASE SHE HAD NEITHER PAIN NOR SICKNESS
HER APPETITE WAS
DIMINISHED SHE KNEW THE REASON
IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WEPT SO MUCH AT
NIGHT
HER STRENGTH WAS LESSENED SHE COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT
SLEEP WAS
COY AND HARD TO BE WON DREAMS WERE DISTRESSING AND BALEFUL
IN THE FAR
FUTURE SHE STILL SEEMED TO ANTICIPATE A TIME WHEN THIS PASSAGE OF MISERY
SHOULD BE GOT OVER AND WHEN SHE SHOULD ONCE MORE BE CALM THOUGH
PERHAPS NEVER AGAIN HAPPY
MEANWHILE HER UNCLE URGED HER TO VISIT TO COMPLY WITH THE FREQUENT
INVITATIONS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
THIS SHE EVADED DOING
SHE COULD NOT
BE CHEERFUL IN COMPANY SHE FELT SHE WAS OBSERVED THERE WITH MORE
CURIOSITY THAN SYMPATHY
OLD LADIES WERE ALWAYS OFFERING HER THEIR
ADVICE RECOMMENDING THIS OR THAT NOSTRUM YOUNG LADIES LOOKED AT HER IN
A WAY SHE UNDERSTOOD AND FROM WHICH SHE SHRANK
THEIR EYES SAID THEY
KNEW SHE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED AS CUSTOM PHRASES IT BY WHOM THEY
WERE NOT CERTAIN
COMMONPLACE YOUNG LADIES CAN BE QUITE AS HARD AS COMMONPLACE YOUNG
GENTLEMEN QUITE AS WORLDLY AND SELFISH
THOSE WHO SUFFER SHOULD ALWAYS
AVOID THEM
GRIEF AND CALAMITY THEY DESPISE THEY SEEM TO REGARD THEM AS
THE JUDGMENTS OF GOD ON THE LOWLY
WITH THEM TO LOVE IS MERELY TO
CONTRIVE A SCHEME FOR ACHIEVING A GOOD MATCH TO BE DISAPPOINTED IS TO
HAVE THEIR SCHEME SEEN THROUGH AND FRUSTRATED
THEY THINK THE FEELINGS
AND PROJECTS OF OTHERS ON THE SUBJECT OF LOVE SIMILAR TO THEIR OWN AND
JUDGE THEM ACCORDINGLY
ALL THIS CAROLINE KNEW PARTLY BY INSTINCT PARTLY BY OBSERVATION
SHE
REGULATED HER CONDUCT BY HER KNOWLEDGE KEEPING HER PALE FACE AND WASTED
FIGURE AS MUCH OUT OF SIGHT AS SHE COULD
LIVING THUS IN COMPLETE
SECLUSION SHE CEASED TO RECEIVE INTELLIGENCE OF THE LITTLE TRANSACTIONS
OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
ONE MORNING HER UNCLE CAME INTO THE PARLOUR WHERE SHE SAT ENDEAVOURING
TO FIND SOME PLEASURE IN PAINTING A LITTLE GROUP OF WILD FLOWERS
GATHERED UNDER A HEDGE AT THE TOP OF THE HOLLOW FIELDS AND SAID TO HER
IN HIS ABRUPT MANNER COME CHILD YOU ARE ALWAYS STOOPING OVER
PALETTE OR BOOK OR SAMPLER LEAVE THAT TINTING WORK
BY THE BYE DO
YOU PUT YOUR PENCIL TO YOUR LIPS WHEN YOU PAINT
SOMETIMES UNCLE WHEN I FORGET
THEN IT IS THAT WHICH IS POISONING YOU
THE PAINTS ARE DELETERIOUS
CHILD
THERE IS WHITE LEAD AND RED LEAD AND VERDIGRIS AND GAMBOGE AND
TWENTY OTHER POISONS IN THOSE COLOUR CAKES
LOCK THEM UP LOCK THEM UP
GET YOUR BONNET ON
I WANT YOU TO MAKE A CALL WITH ME
WITH YOU UNCLE
THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED IN A TONE OF SURPRISE
SHE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO
MAKE CALLS WITH HER UNCLE
SHE NEVER RODE OR WALKED OUT WITH HIM ON ANY
OCCASION
QUICK QUICK I AM ALWAYS BUSY YOU KNOW
I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
SHE HURRIEDLY GATHERED UP HER MATERIALS ASKING MEANTIME WHERE THEY
WERE GOING
TO FIELDHEAD
FIELDHEAD WHAT TO SEE OLD JAMES BOOTH THE GARDENER IS HE ILL
WE ARE GOING TO SEE MISS SHIRLEY KEELDAR
MISS KEELDAR IS SHE COMING TO YORKSHIRE IS SHE AT FIELDHEAD
SHE IS
SHE HAS BEEN THERE A WEEK
I MET HER AT A PARTY LAST
NIGHT THAT PARTY TO WHICH YOU WOULD NOT GO
I WAS PLEASED WITH HER
I
CHOOSE THAT YOU SHALL MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
IT WILL DO YOU GOOD
SHE IS NOW COME OF AGE I SUPPOSE
SHE IS COME OF AGE AND WILL RESIDE FOR A TIME ON HER PROPERTY
I
LECTURED HER ON THE SUBJECT I SHOWED HER HER DUTY
SHE IS NOT
INTRACTABLE
SHE IS RATHER A FINE GIRL SHE WILL TEACH YOU WHAT IT IS TO
HAVE A SPRIGHTLY SPIRIT
NOTHING LACKADAISICAL ABOUT HER
I DON'T THINK SHE WILL WANT TO SEE ME OR TO HAVE ME INTRODUCED TO HER
WHAT GOOD CAN I DO HER HOW CAN I AMUSE HER
PSHAW PUT YOUR BONNET ON
IS SHE PROUD UNCLE
DON'T KNOW
YOU HARDLY IMAGINE SHE WOULD SHOW HER PRIDE TO ME I
SUPPOSE A CHIT LIKE THAT WOULD SCARCELY PRESUME TO GIVE HERSELF AIRS
WITH THE RECTOR OF HER PARISH HOWEVER RICH SHE MIGHT BE
NO
BUT HOW DID SHE BEHAVE TO OTHER PEOPLE
DIDN'T OBSERVE
SHE HOLDS HER HEAD HIGH AND PROBABLY CAN BE SAUCY
ENOUGH WHERE SHE DARE
SHE WOULDN'T BE A WOMAN OTHERWISE
THERE AWAY
NOW FOR YOUR BONNET AT ONCE
NOT NATURALLY VERY CONFIDENT A FAILURE OF PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND A
DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS HAD NOT TENDED TO INCREASE CAROLINE'S PRESENCE OF
MIND AND EASE OF MANNER OR TO GIVE HER ADDITIONAL COURAGE TO FACE
STRANGERS AND SHE QUAILED IN SPITE OF SELF REMONSTRANCE AS SHE AND
HER UNCLE WALKED UP THE BROAD PAVED APPROACH LEADING FROM THE GATEWAY
OF FIELDHEAD TO ITS PORCH
SHE FOLLOWED MR
HELSTONE RELUCTANTLY THROUGH
THAT PORCH INTO THE SOMBRE OLD VESTIBULE BEYOND
VERY SOMBRE IT WAS LONG VAST AND DARK ONE LATTICED WINDOW LIT IT BUT
DIMLY
THE WIDE OLD CHIMNEY CONTAINED NOW NO FIRE FOR THE PRESENT WARM
WEATHER NEEDED IT NOT IT WAS FILLED INSTEAD WITH WILLOW BOUGHS
THE
GALLERY ON HIGH OPPOSITE THE ENTRANCE WAS SEEN BUT IN OUTLINE SO
SHADOWY BECAME THIS HALL TOWARDS ITS CEILING
CARVED STAGS' HEADS WITH
REAL ANTLERS LOOKED DOWN GROTESQUELY FROM THE WALLS
THIS WAS NEITHER A
GRAND NOR A COMFORTABLE HOUSE WITHIN AS WITHOUT IT WAS ANTIQUE
RAMBLING AND INCOMMODIOUS
A PROPERTY OF A THOUSAND A YEAR BELONGED TO
IT WHICH PROPERTY HAD DESCENDED FOR LACK OF MALE HEIRS ON A FEMALE
THERE WERE MERCANTILE FAMILIES IN THE DISTRICT BOASTING TWICE THE
INCOME BUT THE KEELDARS BY VIRTUE OF THEIR ANTIQUITY AND THEIR
DISTINCTION OF LORDS OF THE MANOR TOOK THE PRECEDENCE OF ALL
MR
AND MISS HELSTONE WERE USHERED INTO A PARLOUR
OF COURSE AS WAS TO
BE EXPECTED IN SUCH A GOTHIC OLD BARRACK THIS PARLOUR WAS LINED WITH
OAK FINE DARK GLOSSY PANELS COMPASSED THE WALLS GLOOMILY AND GRANDLY
VERY HANDSOME READER THESE SHINING BROWN PANELS ARE VERY MELLOW IN
COLOURING AND TASTEFUL IN EFFECT BUT IF YOU KNOW WHAT A SPRING CLEAN
IS VERY EXECRABLE AND INHUMAN
WHOEVER HAVING THE BOWELS OF HUMANITY
HAS SEEN SERVANTS SCRUBBING AT THESE POLISHED WOODEN WALLS WITH
BEESWAXED CLOTHS ON A WARM MAY DAY MUST ALLOW THAT THEY ARE INTOLERABLE
AND NOT TO BE ENDURED AND I CANNOT BUT SECRETLY APPLAUD THE BENEVOLENT
BARBARIAN WHO HAD PAINTED ANOTHER AND LARGER APARTMENT OF FIELDHEAD THE
DRAWING ROOM TO WIT FORMERLY ALSO AN OAK ROOM OF A DELICATE PINKY
WHITE THEREBY EARNING FOR HIMSELF THE CHARACTER OF A HUN BUT MIGHTILY
ENHANCING THE CHEERFULNESS OF THAT PORTION OF HIS ABODE AND SAVING
FUTURE HOUSEMAIDS A WORLD OF TOIL
THE BROWN PANELLED PARLOUR WAS FURNISHED ALL IN OLD STYLE AND WITH REAL
OLD FURNITURE
ON EACH SIDE OF THE HIGH MANTELPIECE STOOD TWO ANTIQUE
CHAIRS OF OAK SOLID AS SILVAN THRONES AND IN ONE OF THESE SAT A LADY
BUT IF THIS WERE MISS KEELDAR SHE MUST HAVE COME OF AGE AT LEAST SOME
TWENTY YEARS AGO
SHE WAS OF MATRONLY FORM AND THOUGH SHE WORE NO CAP
AND POSSESSED HAIR OF QUITE AN UNDIMMED AUBURN SHADING SMALL AND
NATURALLY YOUNG LOOKING FEATURES SHE HAD NO YOUTHFUL ASPECT NOR
APPARENTLY THE WISH TO ASSUME IT
YOU COULD HAVE WISHED HER ATTIRE OF A
NEWER FASHION
IN A WELL CUT WELL MADE GOWN HERS WOULD HAVE BEEN NO
UNCOMELY PRESENCE
IT PUZZLED YOU TO GUESS WHY A GARMENT OF HANDSOME
MATERIALS SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN SUCH SCANTY FOLDS AND DEVISED AFTER
SUCH AN OBSOLETE MODE
YOU FELT DISPOSED TO SET DOWN THE WEARER AS
SOMEWHAT ECCENTRIC AT ONCE
THIS LADY RECEIVED THE VISITORS WITH A MIXTURE OF CEREMONY AND
DIFFIDENCE QUITE ENGLISH
NO MIDDLE AGED MATRON WHO WAS NOT AN
ENGLISHWOMAN COULD EVINCE PRECISELY THE SAME MANNER A MANNER SO
UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF OF HER OWN MERITS OF HER POWER TO PLEASE AND YET
SO ANXIOUS TO BE PROPER AND IF POSSIBLE RATHER AGREEABLE THAN
OTHERWISE
IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE HOWEVER MORE EMBARRASSMENT WAS
SHOWN THAN IS USUAL EVEN WITH DIFFIDENT ENGLISHWOMEN
MISS HELSTONE FELT
THIS SYMPATHIZED WITH THE STRANGER AND KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE WHAT WAS
GOOD FOR THE TIMID TOOK A SEAT QUIETLY NEAR HER AND BEGAN TO TALK TO
HER WITH A GENTLE EASE COMMUNICATED FOR THE MOMENT BY THE PRESENCE OF
ONE LESS SELF POSSESSED THAN HERSELF
SHE AND THIS LADY WOULD IF ALONE HAVE AT ONCE GOT ON EXTREMELY WELL
TOGETHER
THE LADY HAD THE CLEAREST VOICE IMAGINABLE INFINITELY SOFTER
AND MORE TUNEFUL THAN COULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLY EXPECTED FROM FORTY
YEARS AND A FORM DECIDEDLY INCLINED TO EMBONPOINT
THIS VOICE
CAROLINE LIKED IT ATONED FOR THE FORMAL IF CORRECT ACCENT AND
LANGUAGE
THE LADY WOULD SOON HAVE DISCOVERED SHE LIKED IT AND HER AND
IN TEN MINUTES THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIENDS
BUT MR
HELSTONE STOOD ON
THE RUG LOOKING AT THEM BOTH LOOKING ESPECIALLY AT THE STRANGE LADY
WITH HIS SARCASTIC KEEN EYE THAT CLEARLY EXPRESSED IMPATIENCE OF HER
CHILLY CEREMONY AND ANNOYANCE AT HER WANT OF APLOMB
HIS HARD GAZE
AND RASPING VOICE DISCOMFITED THE LADY MORE AND MORE
SHE TRIED
HOWEVER TO GET UP LITTLE SPEECHES ABOUT THE WEATHER THE ASPECT OF THE
COUNTRY ETC BUT THE IMPRACTICABLE MR
HELSTONE PRESENTLY FOUND
HIMSELF SOMEWHAT DEAF
WHATEVER SHE SAID HE AFFECTED NOT TO HEAR
DISTINCTLY AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO GO OVER EACH ELABORATELY CONSTRUCTED
NOTHING TWICE
THE EFFORT SOON BECAME TOO MUCH FOR HER
SHE WAS JUST
RISING IN A PERPLEXED FLUTTER NERVOUSLY MURMURING THAT SHE KNEW NOT
WHAT DETAINED MISS KEELDAR THAT SHE WOULD GO AND LOOK FOR HER WHEN
MISS KEELDAR SAVED HER THE TROUBLE BY APPEARING
IT WAS TO BE PRESUMED
AT LEAST THAT SHE WHO NOW CAME IN THROUGH A GLASS DOOR FROM THE GARDEN
OWNED THAT NAME
THERE IS REAL GRACE IN EASE OF MANNER AND SO OLD HELSTONE FELT WHEN AN
ERECT SLIGHT GIRL WALKED UP TO HIM RETAINING WITH HER LEFT HAND HER
LITTLE SILK APRON FULL OF FLOWERS AND GIVING HIM HER RIGHT HAND SAID
PLEASANTLY I KNEW YOU WOULD COME TO SEE ME THOUGH YOU DO THINK MR
YORKE HAS MADE ME A JACOBIN
GOOD MORNING
BUT WE'LL NOT HAVE YOU A JACOBIN RETURNED HE
NO MISS SHIRLEY THEY
SHALL NOT STEAL THE FLOWER OF MY PARISH FROM ME
NOW THAT YOU ARE
AMONGST US YOU SHALL BE MY PUPIL IN POLITICS AND RELIGION I'LL TEACH
YOU SOUND DOCTRINE ON BOTH POINTS
MRS
PRYOR HAS ANTICIPATED YOU SHE REPLIED TURNING TO THE ELDER
LADY
MRS
PRYOR YOU KNOW WAS MY GOVERNESS AND IS STILL MY FRIEND
AND OF ALL THE HIGH AND RIGID TORIES SHE IS QUEEN OF ALL THE STANCH
CHURCHWOMEN SHE IS CHIEF
I HAVE BEEN WELL DRILLED BOTH IN THEOLOGY AND
HISTORY I ASSURE YOU MR
HELSTONE
THE RECTOR IMMEDIATELY BOWED VERY LOW TO MRS
PRYOR AND EXPRESSED
HIMSELF OBLIGED TO HER
THE EX GOVERNESS DISCLAIMED SKILL EITHER IN POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS
CONTROVERSY EXPLAINED THAT SHE THOUGHT SUCH MATTERS LITTLE ADAPTED FOR
FEMALE MINDS BUT AVOWED HERSELF IN GENERAL TERMS THE ADVOCATE OF ORDER
AND LOYALTY AND OF COURSE TRULY ATTACHED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT
SHE
ADDED SHE WAS EVER AVERSE TO CHANGE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND
SOMETHING SCARCELY AUDIBLE ABOUT THE EXTREME DANGER OF BEING TOO READY
TO TAKE UP NEW IDEAS CLOSED HER SENTENCE
MISS KEELDAR THINKS AS YOU THINK I HOPE MADAM
DIFFERENCE OF AGE AND DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERAMENT OCCASION DIFFERENCE OF
SENTIMENT WAS THE REPLY
IT CAN SCARCELY BE EXPECTED THAT THE EAGER
AND YOUNG SHOULD HOLD THE OPINIONS OF THE COOL AND MIDDLE AGED
OH OH WE ARE INDEPENDENT WE THINK FOR OURSELVES CRIED MR
HELSTONE
WE ARE A LITTLE JACOBIN FOR ANYTHING I KNOW A LITTLE
FREETHINKER IN GOOD EARNEST
LET US HAVE A CONFESSION OF FAITH ON THE
SPOT
AND HE TOOK THE HEIRESS'S TWO HANDS CAUSING HER TO LET FALL HER WHOLE
CARGO OF FLOWERS AND SEATED HER BY HIM ON THE SOFA
SAY YOUR CREED HE ORDERED
THE APOSTLES' CREED
YES
SHE SAID IT LIKE A CHILD
NOW FOR ST
ATHANASIUS'S
THAT'S THE TEST
LET ME GATHER UP MY FLOWERS
HERE IS TARTAR COMING HE WILL TREAD UPON
THEM
TARTAR WAS A RATHER LARGE STRONG AND FIERCE LOOKING DOG VERY UGLY
BEING OF A BREED BETWEEN MASTIFF AND BULLDOG WHO AT THIS MOMENT ENTERED
THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR AND POSTING DIRECTLY TO THE RUG SNUFFED THE
FRESH FLOWERS SCATTERED THERE
HE SEEMED TO SCORN THEM AS FOOD BUT
PROBABLY THINKING THEIR VELVETY PETALS MIGHT BE CONVENIENT AS LITTER HE
WAS TURNING ROUND PREPARATORY TO DEPOSITING HIS TAWNY BULK UPON THEM
WHEN MISS HELSTONE AND MISS KEELDAR SIMULTANEOUSLY STOOPED TO THE
RESCUE
THANK YOU SAID THE HEIRESS AS SHE AGAIN HELD OUT HER LITTLE APRON
FOR CAROLINE TO HEAP THE BLOSSOMS INTO IT
IS THIS YOUR DAUGHTER MR
HELSTONE SHE ASKED
MY NIECE CAROLINE
MISS KEELDAR SHOOK HANDS WITH HER AND THEN LOOKED AT HER
CAROLINE ALSO
LOOKED AT HER HOSTESS
SHIRLEY KEELDAR SHE HAD NO CHRISTIAN NAME BUT SHIRLEY HER PARENTS WHO
HAD WISHED TO HAVE A SON FINDING THAT AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF MARRIAGE
PROVIDENCE HAD GRANTED THEM ONLY A DAUGHTER BESTOWED ON HER THE SAME
MASCULINE FAMILY COGNOMEN THEY WOULD HAVE BESTOWED ON A BOY IF WITH A
BOY THEY HAD BEEN BLESSED SHIRLEY KEELDAR WAS NO UGLY HEIRESS
SHE WAS
AGREEABLE TO THE EYE
HER HEIGHT AND SHAPE WERE NOT UNLIKE MISS
HELSTONE'S PERHAPS IN STATURE SHE MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE BY AN INCH
OR TWO
SHE WAS GRACEFULLY MADE AND HER FACE TOO POSSESSED A CHARM AS
WELL DESCRIBED BY THE WORD GRACE AS ANY OTHER
IT WAS PALE NATURALLY
BUT INTELLIGENT AND OF VARIED EXPRESSION
SHE WAS NOT A BLONDE LIKE
CAROLINE
CLEAR AND DARK WERE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HER ASPECT AS TO
COLOUR
HER FACE AND BROW WERE CLEAR HER EYES OF THE DARKEST GRAY NO
GREEN LIGHTS IN THEM TRANSPARENT PURE NEUTRAL GRAY AND HER HAIR OF
THE DARKEST BROWN
HER FEATURES WERE DISTINGUISHED BY WHICH I DO NOT
MEAN THAT THEY WERE HIGH BONY AND ROMAN BEING INDEED RATHER SMALL AND
SLIGHTLY MARKED THAN OTHERWISE BUT ONLY THAT THEY WERE TO USE A FEW
FRENCH WORDS FINS GRACIEUX SPIRITUELS MOBILE THEY WERE AND
SPEAKING BUT THEIR CHANGES WERE NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD NOR THEIR LANGUAGE
INTERPRETED ALL AT ONCE
SHE EXAMINED CAROLINE SERIOUSLY INCLINING HER
HEAD A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE WITH A THOUGHTFUL AIR
YOU SEE SHE IS ONLY A FEEBLE CHICK OBSERVED MR
HELSTONE
SHE LOOKS YOUNG YOUNGER THAN I HOW OLD ARE YOU SHE INQUIRED IN A
MANNER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PATRONIZING IF IT HAD NOT BEEN EXTREMELY
SOLEMN AND SIMPLE
EIGHTEEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS
AND I AM TWENTY ONE
SHE SAID NO MORE
SHE HAD NOW PLACED HER FLOWERS ON THE TABLE AND WAS
BUSIED IN ARRANGING THEM
AND ST
ATHANASIUS'S CREED URGED THE RECTOR
YOU BELIEVE IT ALL
DON'T YOU
I CAN'T REMEMBER IT QUITE ALL
I WILL GIVE YOU A NOSEGAY MR
HELSTONE
WHEN I HAVE GIVEN YOUR NIECE ONE
SHE HAD SELECTED A LITTLE BOUQUET OF ONE BRILLIANT AND TWO OR THREE
DELICATE FLOWERS RELIEVED BY A SPRAY OF DARK VERDURE
SHE TIED IT WITH
SILK FROM HER WORK BOX AND PLACED IT ON CAROLINE'S LAP AND THEN SHE
PUT HER HANDS BEHIND HER AND STOOD BENDING SLIGHTLY TOWARDS HER GUEST
STILL REGARDING HER IN THE ATTITUDE AND WITH SOMETHING OF THE ASPECT OF
A GRAVE BUT GALLANT LITTLE CAVALIER
THIS TEMPORARY EXPRESSION OF FACE
WAS AIDED BY THE STYLE IN WHICH SHE WORE HER HAIR PARTED ON ONE TEMPLE
AND BRUSHED IN A GLOSSY SWEEP ABOVE THE FOREHEAD WHENCE IT FELL IN
CURLS THAT LOOKED NATURAL SO FREE WERE THEIR WAVY UNDULATIONS
ARE YOU TIRED WITH YOUR WALK SHE INQUIRED
NO NOT IN THE LEAST
IT IS BUT A SHORT DISTANCE BUT A MILE
YOU LOOK PALE IS SHE ALWAYS SO PALE SHE ASKED TURNING TO THE
RECTOR
SHE USED TO BE AS ROSY AS THE REDDEST OF YOUR FLOWERS
WHY IS SHE ALTERED WHAT HAS MADE HER PALE HAS SHE BEEN ILL
SHE TELLS ME SHE WANTS A CHANGE
SHE OUGHT TO HAVE ONE
YOU OUGHT TO GIVE HER ONE
YOU SHOULD SEND HER
TO THE SEA COAST
I WILL ERE SUMMER IS OVER
MEANTIME I INTEND HER TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
WITH YOU IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION
I AM SURE MISS KEELDAR WILL HAVE NO OBJECTION HERE OBSERVED MRS
PRYOR
I THINK I MAY TAKE IT UPON ME TO SAY THAT MISS HELSTONE'S
FREQUENT PRESENCE AT FIELDHEAD WILL BE ESTEEMED A FAVOUR
YOU SPEAK MY SENTIMENTS PRECISELY MA'AM SAID SHIRLEY AND I THANK
YOU FOR ANTICIPATING ME LET ME TELL YOU SHE CONTINUED TURNING AGAIN
TO CAROLINE THAT YOU ALSO OUGHT TO THANK MY GOVERNESS
IT IS NOT EVERY
ONE SHE WOULD WELCOME AS SHE HAS WELCOMED YOU
YOU ARE DISTINGUISHED
MORE THAN YOU THINK
THIS MORNING AS SOON AS YOU ARE GONE I SHALL ASK
MRS
PRYOR'S OPINION OF YOU
I AM APT TO RELY ON HER JUDGMENT OF
CHARACTER FOR HITHERTO I HAVE FOUND IT WONDROUS ACCURATE
ALREADY I
FORESEE A FAVOURABLE ANSWER TO MY INQUIRIES DO I NOT GUESS RIGHTLY
MRS
PRYOR
MY DEAR YOU SAID BUT NOW YOU WOULD ASK MY OPINION WHEN MISS HELSTONE
WAS GONE
I AM SCARCELY LIKELY TO GIVE IT IN HER PRESENCE
NO AND PERHAPS IT WILL BE LONG ENOUGH BEFORE I OBTAIN IT I AM
SOMETIMES SADLY TANTALIZED MR
HELSTONE BY MRS
PRYOR'S EXTREME
CAUTION
HER JUDGMENTS OUGHT TO BE CORRECT WHEN THEY COME FOR THEY ARE
OFTEN AS TARDY OF DELIVERY AS A LORD CHANCELLOR'S
ON SOME PEOPLE'S
CHARACTERS I CANNOT GET HER TO PRONOUNCE A SENTENCE ENTREAT AS I MAY
MRS
PRYOR HERE SMILED
YES SAID HER PUPIL I KNOW WHAT THAT SMILE MEANS
YOU ARE THINKING
OF MY GENTLEMAN TENANT DO YOU KNOW MR
MOORE OF THE HOLLOW SHE ASKED
MR
HELSTONE
AY AY YOUR TENANT SO HE IS
YOU HAVE SEEN A GOOD DEAL OF HIM NO
DOUBT SINCE YOU CAME
I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SEE HIM
THERE WAS BUSINESS TO TRANSACT
BUSINESS REALLY THE WORD MAKES ME CONSCIOUS I AM INDEED NO LONGER A
GIRL BUT QUITE A WOMAN AND SOMETHING MORE
I AM AN ESQUIRE SHIRLEY
KEELDAR ESQUIRE OUGHT TO BE MY STYLE AND TITLE
THEY GAVE ME A MAN'S
NAME I HOLD A MAN'S POSITION
IT IS ENOUGH TO INSPIRE ME WITH A TOUCH
OF MANHOOD AND WHEN I SEE SUCH PEOPLE AS THAT STATELY
ANGLO BELGIAN THAT GRARD MOORE BEFORE ME GRAVELY TALKING TO ME OF
BUSINESS REALLY I FEEL QUITE GENTLEMANLIKE
YOU MUST CHOOSE ME FOR YOUR
CHURCHWARDEN MR
HELSTONE THE NEXT TIME YOU ELECT NEW ONES
THEY OUGHT
TO MAKE ME A MAGISTRATE AND A CAPTAIN OF YEOMANRY
TONY LUMPKIN'S MOTHER
WAS A COLONEL AND HIS AUNT A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
WHY SHOULDN'T I BE
WITH ALL MY HEART
IF YOU CHOOSE TO GET UP A REQUISITION ON THE
SUBJECT I PROMISE TO HEAD THE LIST OF SIGNATURES WITH MY NAME
BUT YOU
WERE SPEAKING OF MOORE
AH YES
I FIND IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND MR
MOORE TO KNOW
WHAT TO THINK OF HIM WHETHER TO LIKE HIM OR NOT
HE SEEMS A TENANT OF
WHOM ANY PROPRIETOR MIGHT BE PROUD AND PROUD OF HIM I AM IN THAT
SENSE BUT AS A NEIGHBOUR WHAT IS HE AGAIN AND AGAIN I HAVE ENTREATED
MRS
PRYOR TO SAY WHAT SHE THINKS OF HIM BUT SHE STILL EVADES RETURNING
A DIRECT ANSWER
I HOPE YOU WILL BE LESS ORACULAR MR
HELSTONE AND
PRONOUNCE AT ONCE
DO YOU LIKE HIM
NOT AT ALL JUST NOW
HIS NAME IS ENTIRELY BLOTTED FROM MY GOOD BOOKS
WHAT IS THE MATTER WHAT HAS HE DONE
MY UNCLE AND HE DISAGREE ON POLITICS INTERPOSED THE LOW VOICE OF
CAROLINE
SHE HAD BETTER NOT HAVE SPOKEN JUST THEN
HAVING SCARCELY
JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION BEFORE IT WAS NOT APROPOS TO DO IT NOW
SHE
FELT THIS WITH NERVOUS ACUTENESS AS SOON AS SHE HAD SPOKEN AND COLOURED
TO THE EYES
WHAT ARE MOORE'S POLITICS INQUIRED SHIRLEY
THOSE OF A TRADESMAN RETURNED THE RECTOR NARROW SELFISH AND
UNPATRIOTIC
THE MAN IS ETERNALLY WRITING AND SPEAKING AGAINST THE
CONTINUANCE OF THE WAR
I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH HIM
THE WAR HURTS HIS TRADE
I REMEMBER HE REMARKED THAT ONLY YESTERDAY
BUT WHAT OTHER OBJECTION HAVE YOU TO HIM
THAT IS ENOUGH
HE LOOKS THE GENTLEMAN IN MY SENSE OF THE TERM PURSUED SHIRLEY AND
IT PLEASES ME TO THINK HE IS SUCH
CAROLINE RENT THE TYRIAN PETALS OF THE ONE BRILLIANT FLOWER IN HER
BOUQUET AND ANSWERED IN DISTINCT TONES DECIDEDLY HE IS SHIRLEY
HEARING THIS COURAGEOUS AFFIRMATION FLASHED AN ARCH SEARCHING GLANCE
AT THE SPEAKER FROM HER DEEP EXPRESSIVE EYES
YOU ARE HIS FRIEND AT ANY RATE SHE SAID
YOU DEFEND HIM IN HIS
ABSENCE
I AM BOTH HIS FRIEND AND HIS RELATIVE WAS THE PROMPT REPLY
ROBERT
MOORE IS MY COUSIN
OH THEN YOU CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT HIM
JUST GIVE ME A SKETCH OF HIS
CHARACTER
INSUPERABLE EMBARRASSMENT SEIZED CAROLINE WHEN THIS DEMAND WAS MADE
SHE
COULD NOT AND DID NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH IT
HER SILENCE WAS
IMMEDIATELY COVERED BY MRS
PRYOR WHO PROCEEDED TO ADDRESS SUNDRY
QUESTIONS TO MR
HELSTONE REGARDING A FAMILY OR TWO IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH WHOSE CONNECTIONS IN THE SOUTH SHE SAID SHE WAS
ACQUAINTED
SHIRLEY SOON WITHDREW HER GAZE FROM MISS HELSTONE'S FACE
SHE DID NOT RENEW HER INTERROGATIONS BUT RETURNING TO HER FLOWERS
PROCEEDED TO CHOOSE A NOSEGAY FOR THE RECTOR
SHE PRESENTED IT TO HIM AS
HE TOOK LEAVE AND RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF A SALUTE ON THE HAND IN
RETURN
BE SURE YOU WEAR IT FOR MY SAKE SAID SHE
NEXT MY HEART OF COURSE RESPONDED HELSTONE MRS
PRYOR TAKE CARE
OF THIS FUTURE MAGISTRATE THIS CHURCHWARDEN IN PERSPECTIVE THIS
CAPTAIN OF YEOMANRY THIS YOUNG SQUIRE OF BRIARFIELD IN A WORD
DON'T
LET HIM EXERT HIMSELF TOO MUCH DON'T LET HIM BREAK HIS NECK IN HUNTING
ESPECIALLY LET HIM MIND HOW HE RIDES DOWN THAT DANGEROUS HILL NEAR THE
HOLLOW
I LIKE A DESCENT SAID SHIRLEY I LIKE TO CLEAR IT RAPIDLY AND
ESPECIALLY I LIKE THAT ROMANTIC HOLLOW WITH ALL MY HEART
ROMANTIC WITH A MILL IN IT
ROMANTIC WITH A MILL IN IT
THE OLD MILL AND THE WHITE COTTAGE ARE EACH
ADMIRABLE IN ITS WAY
AND THE COUNTING HOUSE MR
KEELDAR
THE COUNTING HOUSE IS BETTER THAN MY BLOOM COLOURED DRAWING ROOM
I
ADORE THE COUNTING HOUSE
AND THE TRADE THE CLOTH THE GREASY WOOL THE POLLUTING DYEING VATS
THE TRADE IS TO BE THOROUGHLY RESPECTED
AND THE TRADESMAN IS A HERO GOOD
I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO
I THOUGHT THE TRADESMAN LOOKED HEROIC
MISCHIEF SPIRIT AND GLEE SPARKLED ALL OVER HER FACE AS SHE THUS
BANDIED WORDS WITH THE OLD COSSACK WHO ALMOST EQUALLY ENJOYED THE TILT
CAPTAIN KEELDAR YOU HAVE NO MERCANTILE BLOOD IN YOUR VEINS
WHY ARE
YOU SO FOND OF TRADE
BECAUSE I AM A MILL OWNER OF COURSE
HALF MY INCOME COMES FROM THE
WORKS IN THAT HOLLOW
DON'T ENTER INTO PARTNERSHIP THAT'S ALL
YOU'VE PUT IT INTO MY HEAD YOU'VE PUT IT INTO MY HEAD SHE EXCLAIMED
WITH A JOYOUS LAUGH
IT WILL NEVER GET OUT
THANK YOU AND WAVING HER
HAND WHITE AS A LILY AND FINE AS A FAIRY'S SHE VANISHED WITHIN THE
PORCH WHILE THE RECTOR AND HIS NIECE PASSED OUT THROUGH THE ARCHED
GATEWAY
CHAPTER XII
SHIRLEY AND CAROLINE
SHIRLEY SHOWED SHE HAD BEEN SINCERE IN SAYING SHE SHOULD BE GLAD OF
CAROLINE'S SOCIETY BY FREQUENTLY SEEKING IT AND INDEED IF SHE HAD
NOT SOUGHT IT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD IT FOR MISS HELSTONE WAS SLOW TO
MAKE FRESH ACQUAINTANCE
SHE WAS ALWAYS HELD BACK BY THE IDEA THAT
PEOPLE COULD NOT WANT HER THAT SHE COULD NOT AMUSE THEM AND A
BRILLIANT HAPPY YOUTHFUL CREATURE LIKE THE HEIRESS OF FIELDHEAD SEEMED
TO HER TOO COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF SOCIETY SO UNINTERESTING AS HERS
EVER TO FIND IT REALLY WELCOME
SHIRLEY MIGHT BE BRILLIANT AND PROBABLY HAPPY LIKEWISE BUT NO ONE IS
INDEPENDENT OF GENIAL SOCIETY AND THOUGH IN ABOUT A MONTH SHE HAD MADE
THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MOST OF THE FAMILIES ROUND AND WAS ON QUITE FREE
AND EASY TERMS WITH ALL THE MISSES SYKES AND ALL THE MISSES PEARSON
AND THE TWO SUPERLATIVE MISSES WYNNE OF WALDEN HALL YET IT APPEARED
SHE FOUND NONE AMONGST THEM VERY GENIAL SHE FRATERNIZED WITH NONE OF
THEM TO USE HER OWN WORDS
IF SHE HAD HAD THE BLISS TO BE REALLY
SHIRLEY KEELDAR ESQ LORD OF THE MANOR OF BRIARFIELD THERE WAS NOT A
SINGLE FAIR ONE IN THIS AND THE TWO NEIGHBOURING PARISHES WHOM SHE
SHOULD HAVE FELT DISPOSED TO REQUEST TO BECOME MRS
KEELDAR LADY OF THE
MANOR
THIS DECLARATION SHE MADE TO MRS
PRYOR WHO RECEIVED IT VERY
QUIETLY AS SHE DID MOST OF HER PUPIL'S OFF HAND SPEECHES RESPONDING
MY DEAR DO NOT ALLOW THAT HABIT OF ALLUDING TO YOURSELF AS A GENTLEMAN
TO BE CONFIRMED
IT IS A STRANGE ONE
THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW YOU HEARING
YOU SPEAK THUS WOULD THINK YOU AFFECTED MASCULINE MANNERS
SHIRLEY NEVER LAUGHED AT HER FORMER GOVERNESS EVEN THE LITTLE
FORMALITIES AND HARMLESS PECULIARITIES OF THAT LADY WERE RESPECTABLE IN
HER EYES
HAD IT BEEN OTHERWISE SHE WOULD HAVE PROVED HERSELF A WEAK
CHARACTER AT ONCE FOR IT IS ONLY THE WEAK WHO MAKE A BUTT OF QUIET
WORTH
THEREFORE SHE TOOK HER REMONSTRANCE IN SILENCE
SHE STOOD
QUIETLY NEAR THE WINDOW LOOKING AT THE GRAND CEDAR ON HER LAWN
WATCHING A BIRD ON ONE OF ITS LOWER BOUGHS
PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO
CHIRRUP TO THE BIRD SOON HER CHIRRUP GREW CLEARER ERE LONG SHE WAS
WHISTLING THE WHISTLE STRUCK INTO A TUNE AND VERY SWEETLY AND DEFTLY
IT WAS EXECUTED
MY DEAR EXPOSTULATED MRS
PRYOR
WAS I WHISTLING SAID SHIRLEY
I FORGOT
I BEG YOUR PARDON MA'AM
I
HAD RESOLVED TO TAKE CARE NOT TO WHISTLE BEFORE YOU
BUT MISS KEELDAR WHERE DID YOU LEARN TO WHISTLE YOU MUST HAVE GOT
THE HABIT SINCE YOU CAME DOWN INTO YORKSHIRE
I NEVER KNEW YOU GUILTY OF
IT BEFORE
OH I LEARNED TO WHISTLE A LONG WHILE AGO
WHO TAUGHT YOU
NO ONE
I TOOK IT UP BY LISTENING AND I HAD LAID IT DOWN AGAIN
BUT
LATELY YESTERDAY EVENING AS I WAS COMING UP OUR LANE I HEARD A
GENTLEMAN WHISTLING THAT VERY TUNE IN THE FIELD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
HEDGE AND THAT REMINDED ME
WHAT GENTLEMAN WAS IT
WE HAVE ONLY ONE GENTLEMAN IN THIS REGION MA'AM AND THAT IS MR
MOORE AT LEAST HE IS THE ONLY GENTLEMAN WHO IS NOT GRAY HAIRED
MY TWO
VENERABLE FAVOURITES MR
HELSTONE AND MR
YORKE IT IS TRUE ARE FINE
OLD BEAUS INFINITELY BETTER THAN ANY OF THE STUPID YOUNG ONES
MRS
PRYOR WAS SILENT
YOU DO NOT LIKE MR
HELSTONE MA'AM
MY DEAR MR
HELSTONE'S OFFICE SECURES HIM FROM CRITICISM
YOU GENERALLY CONTRIVE TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN HE IS ANNOUNCED
DO YOU WALK OUT THIS MORNING MY DEAR
YES I SHALL GO TO THE RECTORY AND SEEK AND FIND CAROLINE HELSTONE
AND MAKE HER TAKE SOME EXERCISE
SHE SHALL HAVE A BREEZY WALK OVER
NUNNELY COMMON
IF YOU GO IN THAT DIRECTION MY DEAR HAVE THE GOODNESS TO REMIND MISS
HELSTONE TO WRAP UP WELL AS THERE IS A FRESH WIND AND SHE APPEARS TO
ME TO REQUIRE CARE
YOU SHALL BE MINUTELY OBEYED MRS
PRYOR
MEANTIME WILL YOU NOT
ACCOMPANY US YOURSELF
NO MY LOVE I SHOULD BE A RESTRAINT UPON YOU
I AM STOUT AND CANNOT
WALK SO QUICKLY AS YOU WOULD WISH TO DO
SHIRLEY EASILY PERSUADED CAROLINE TO GO WITH HER AND WHEN THEY WERE
FAIRLY OUT ON THE QUIET ROAD TRAVERSING THE EXTENSIVE AND SOLITARY
SWEEP OF NUNNELY COMMON SHE AS EASILY DREW HER INTO CONVERSATION
THE
FIRST FEELINGS OF DIFFIDENCE OVERCOME CAROLINE SOON FELT GLAD TO TALK
WITH MISS KEELDAR
THE VERY FIRST INTERCHANGE OF SLIGHT OBSERVATIONS
SUFFICED TO GIVE EACH AN IDEA OF WHAT THE OTHER WAS
SHIRLEY SAID SHE
LIKED THE GREEN SWEEP OF THE COMMON TURF AND BETTER STILL THE HEATH
ON ITS RIDGES FOR THE HEATH REMINDED HER OF MOORS
SHE HAD SEEN MOORS
WHEN SHE WAS TRAVELLING ON THE BORDERS NEAR SCOTLAND
SHE REMEMBERED
PARTICULARLY A DISTRICT TRAVERSED ONE LONG AFTERNOON ON A SULTRY BUT
SUNLESS DAY IN SUMMER
THEY JOURNEYED FROM NOON TILL SUNSET OVER WHAT
SEEMED A BOUNDLESS WASTE OF DEEP HEATH AND NOTHING HAD THEY SEEN BUT
WILD SHEEP NOTHING HEARD BUT THE CRIES OF WILD BIRDS
I KNOW HOW THE HEATH WOULD LOOK ON SUCH A DAY SAID CAROLINE
PURPLE BLACK A DEEPER SHADE OF THE SKY TINT AND THAT WOULD BE LIVID
YES QUITE LIVID WITH BRASSY EDGES TO THE CLOUDS AND HERE AND THERE A
WHITE GLEAM MORE GHASTLY THAN THE LURID TINGE WHICH AS YOU LOOKED AT
IT YOU MOMENTARILY EXPECTED WOULD KINDLE INTO BLINDING LIGHTNING
DID IT THUNDER
IT MUTTERED DISTANT PEALS BUT THE STORM DID NOT BREAK TILL EVENING
AFTER WE HAD REACHED OUR INN THAT INN BEING AN ISOLATED HOUSE AT THE
FOOT OF A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS
DID YOU WATCH THE CLOUDS COME DOWN OVER THE MOUNTAINS
I DID
I STOOD AT THE WINDOW AN HOUR WATCHING THEM
THE HILLS SEEMED
ROLLED IN A SULLEN MIST AND WHEN THE RAIN FELL IN WHITENING SHEETS
SUDDENLY THEY WERE BLOTTED FROM THE PROSPECT THEY WERE WASHED FROM THE
WORLD
I HAVE SEEN SUCH STORMS IN HILLY DISTRICTS IN YORKSHIRE AND AT THEIR
RIOTOUS CLIMAX WHILE THE SKY WAS ALL CATARACT THE EARTH ALL FLOOD I
HAVE REMEMBERED THE DELUGE
IT IS SINGULARLY REVIVING AFTER SUCH HURRICANES TO FEEL CALM RETURN
AND FROM THE OPENING CLOUDS TO RECEIVE A CONSOLATORY GLEAM SOFTLY
TESTIFYING THAT THE SUN IS NOT QUENCHED
MISS KEELDAR JUST STAND STILL NOW AND LOOK DOWN AT NUNNELY DALE AND
WOOD
THEY BOTH HALTED ON THE GREEN BROW OF THE COMMON
THEY LOOKED DOWN ON
THE DEEP VALLEY ROBED IN MAY RAIMENT ON VARIED MEADS SOME PEARLED WITH
DAISIES AND SOME GOLDEN WITH KING CUPS
TO DAY ALL THIS YOUNG VERDURE
SMILED CLEAR IN SUNLIGHT TRANSPARENT EMERALD AND AMBER GLEAMS PLAYED
OVER IT
ON NUNNWOOD THE SOLE REMNANT OF ANTIQUE BRITISH FOREST IN A
REGION WHOSE LOWLANDS WERE ONCE ALL SILVAN CHASE AS ITS HIGHLANDS WERE
BREAST DEEP HEATHER SLEPT THE SHADOW OF A CLOUD THE DISTANT HILLS WERE
DAPPLED THE HORIZON WAS SHADED AND TINTED LIKE MOTHER OF PEARL SILVERY
BLUES SOFT PURPLES EVANESCENT GREENS AND ROSE SHADES ALL MELTING INTO
FLEECES OF WHITE CLOUD PURE AS AZURY SNOW ALLURED THE EYE AS WITH A
REMOTE GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN'S FOUNDATIONS
THE AIR BLOWING ON THE BROW WAS
FRESH AND SWEET AND BRACING
OUR ENGLAND IS A BONNY ISLAND SAID SHIRLEY AND YORKSHIRE IS ONE OF
HER BONNIEST NOOKS
YOU ARE A YORKSHIRE GIRL TOO
I AM YORKSHIRE IN BLOOD AND BIRTH
FIVE GENERATIONS OF MY RACE SLEEP
UNDER THE AISLES OF BRIARFIELD CHURCH
I DREW MY FIRST BREATH IN THE OLD
BLACK HALL BEHIND US
HEREUPON CAROLINE PRESENTED HER HAND WHICH WAS ACCORDINGLY TAKEN AND
SHAKEN
WE ARE COMPATRIOTS SAID SHE
YES AGREED SHIRLEY WITH A GRAVE NOD
AND THAT ASKED MISS KEELDAR POINTING TO THE FOREST THAT IS
NUNNWOOD
IT IS
WERE YOU EVER THERE
MANY A TIME
IN THE HEART OF IT
YES
WHAT IS IT LIKE
IT IS LIKE AN ENCAMPMENT OF FOREST SONS OF ANAK
THE TREES ARE HUGE AND
OLD
WHEN YOU STAND AT THEIR ROOTS THE SUMMITS SEEM IN ANOTHER REGION
THE TRUNKS REMAIN STILL AND FIRM AS PILLARS WHILE THE BOUGHS SWAY TO
EVERY BREEZE
IN THE DEEPEST CALM THEIR LEAVES ARE NEVER QUITE HUSHED
AND IN HIGH WIND A FLOOD RUSHES A SEA THUNDERS ABOVE YOU
WAS IT NOT ONE OF ROBIN HOOD'S HAUNTS
YES AND THERE ARE MEMENTOS OF HIM STILL EXISTING
TO PENETRATE INTO
NUNNWOOD MISS KEELDAR IS TO GO FAR BACK INTO THE DIM DAYS OF OLD
CAN
YOU SEE A BREAK IN THE FOREST ABOUT THE CENTRE
YES DISTINCTLY
THAT BREAK IS A DELL A DEEP HOLLOW CUP LINED WITH TURF AS GREEN AND
SHORT AS THE SOD OF THIS COMMON
THE VERY OLDEST OF THE TREES GNARLED
MIGHTY OAKS CROWD ABOUT THE BRINK OF THIS DELL
IN THE BOTTOM LIE THE
RUINS OF A NUNNERY
WE WILL GO YOU AND I ALONE CAROLINE TO THAT WOOD EARLY SOME FINE
SUMMER MORNING AND SPEND A LONG DAY THERE
WE CAN TAKE PENCILS AND
SKETCH BOOKS AND ANY INTERESTING READING BOOK WE LIKE AND OF COURSE WE
SHALL TAKE SOMETHING TO EAT
I HAVE TWO LITTLE BASKETS IN WHICH MRS
GILL MY HOUSEKEEPER MIGHT PACK OUR PROVISIONS AND WE COULD EACH CARRY
OUR OWN
IT WOULD NOT TIRE YOU TOO MUCH TO WALK SO FAR
OH NO ESPECIALLY IF WE RESTED THE WHOLE DAY IN THE WOOD
AND I KNOW
ALL THE PLEASANTEST SPOTS
I KNOW WHERE WE COULD GET NUTS IN NUTTING
TIME I KNOW WHERE WILD STRAWBERRIES ABOUND I KNOW CERTAIN LONELY
QUITE UNTRODDEN GLADES CARPETED WITH STRANGE MOSSES SOME YELLOW AS IF
GILDED SOME A SOBER GRAY SOME GEM GREEN
I KNOW GROUPS OF TREES THAT
RAVISH THE EYE WITH THEIR PERFECT PICTURE LIKE EFFECTS RUDE OAK
DELICATE BIRCH GLOSSY BEECH CLUSTERED IN CONTRAST AND ASH TREES
STATELY AS SAUL STANDING ISOLATED AND SUPERANNUATED WOOD GIANTS CLAD
IN BRIGHT SHROUDS OF IVY
MISS KEELDAR I COULD GUIDE YOU
YOU WOULD BE DULL WITH ME ALONE
I SHOULD NOT
I THINK WE SHOULD SUIT AND WHAT THIRD PERSON IS THERE
WHOSE PRESENCE WOULD NOT SPOIL OUR PLEASURE
INDEED I KNOW OF NONE ABOUT OUR OWN AGES NO LADY AT LEAST AND AS TO
GENTLEMEN
AN EXCURSION BECOMES QUITE A DIFFERENT THING WHEN THERE ARE GENTLEMEN
OF THE PARTY INTERRUPTED CAROLINE
I AGREE WITH YOU QUITE A DIFFERENT THING TO WHAT WE WERE PROPOSING
WE WERE GOING SIMPLY TO SEE THE OLD TREES THE OLD RUINS TO PASS A DAY
IN OLD TIMES SURROUNDED BY OLDEN SILENCE AND ABOVE ALL BY QUIETUDE
YOU ARE RIGHT AND THE PRESENCE OF GENTLEMEN DISPELS THE LAST CHARM I
THINK
IF THEY ARE OF THE WRONG SORT LIKE YOUR MALONES AND YOUR YOUNG
SYKES AND WYNNES IRRITATION TAKES THE PLACE OF SERENITY
IF THEY ARE
OF THE RIGHT SORT THERE IS STILL A CHANGE I CAN HARDLY TELL WHAT
CHANGE ONE EASY TO FEEL DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE
WE FORGET NATURE IMPRIMIS
AND THEN NATURE FORGETS US COVERS HER VAST CALM BROW WITH A DIM VEIL
CONCEALS HER FACE AND WITHDRAWS THE PEACEFUL JOY WITH WHICH IF WE HAD
BEEN CONTENT TO WORSHIP HER ONLY SHE WOULD HAVE FILLED OUR HEARTS
WHAT DOES SHE GIVE US INSTEAD
MORE ELATION AND MORE ANXIETY AN EXCITEMENT THAT STEALS THE HOURS AWAY
FAST AND A TROUBLE THAT RUFFLES THEIR COURSE
OUR POWER OF BEING HAPPY LIES A GOOD DEAL IN OURSELVES I BELIEVE
REMARKED CAROLINE SAGELY
I HAVE GONE TO NUNNWOOD WITH A LARGE
PARTY ALL THE CURATES AND SOME OTHER GENTRY OF THESE PARTS TOGETHER
WITH SUNDRY LADIES AND I FOUND THE AFFAIR INSUFFERABLY TEDIOUS AND
ABSURD AND I HAVE GONE QUITE ALONE OR ACCOMPANIED BUT BY FANNY WHO
SAT IN THE WOODMAN'S HUT AND SEWED OR TALKED TO THE GOODWIFE WHILE I
ROAMED ABOUT AND MADE SKETCHES OR READ AND I HAVE ENJOYED MUCH
HAPPINESS OF A QUIET KIND ALL DAY LONG
BUT THAT WAS WHEN I WAS
YOUNG TWO YEARS AGO
DID YOU EVER GO WITH YOUR COUSIN ROBERT MOORE
YES ONCE
WHAT SORT OF A COMPANION IS HE ON THESE OCCASIONS
A COUSIN YOU KNOW IS DIFFERENT TO A STRANGER
I AM AWARE OF THAT BUT COUSINS IF THEY ARE STUPID ARE STILL MORE
INSUPPORTABLE THAN STRANGERS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SO EASILY KEEP THEM AT
A DISTANCE
BUT YOUR COUSIN IS NOT STUPID
NO BUT
WELL
IF THE COMPANY OF FOOLS IRRITATES AS YOU SAY THE SOCIETY OF CLEVER
MEN LEAVES ITS OWN PECULIAR PAIN ALSO
WHERE THE GOODNESS OR TALENT OF
YOUR FRIEND IS BEYOND AND ABOVE ALL DOUBT YOUR OWN WORTHINESS TO BE HIS
ASSOCIATE OFTEN BECOMES A MATTER OF QUESTION
OH THERE I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU
THAT CROTCHET IS NOT ONE I SHOULD CHOOSE
TO ENTERTAIN FOR AN INSTANT
I CONSIDER MYSELF NOT UNWORTHY TO BE THE
ASSOCIATE OF THE BEST OF THEM OF GENTLEMEN I MEAN THOUGH THAT IS
SAYING A GREAT DEAL
WHERE THEY ARE GOOD THEY ARE VERY GOOD I BELIEVE
YOUR UNCLE BY THE BYE IS NOT A BAD SPECIMEN OF THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
I AM ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE HIS BROWN KEEN SENSIBLE OLD FACE EITHER IN MY
OWN HOUSE OR ANY OTHER
ARE YOU FOND OF HIM IS HE KIND TO YOU NOW
SPEAK THE TRUTH
HE HAS BROUGHT ME UP FROM CHILDHOOD I DOUBT NOT PRECISELY AS HE WOULD
HAVE BROUGHT UP HIS OWN DAUGHTER IF HE HAD HAD ONE AND THAT IS
KINDNESS
BUT I AM NOT FOND OF HIM
I WOULD RATHER BE OUT OF HIS
PRESENCE THAN IN IT
STRANGE WHEN HE HAS THE ART OF MAKING HIMSELF SO AGREEABLE
YES IN COMPANY BUT HE IS STERN AND SILENT AT HOME
AS HE PUTS AWAY
HIS CANE AND SHOVEL HAT IN THE RECTORY HALL SO HE LOCKS HIS LIVELINESS
IN HIS BOOK CASE AND STUDY DESK THE KNITTED BROW AND BRIEF WORD FOR THE
FIRESIDE THE SMILE THE JEST THE WITTY SALLY FOR SOCIETY
IS HE TYRANNICAL
NOT IN THE LEAST
HE IS NEITHER TYRANNICAL NOR HYPOCRITICAL
HE IS
SIMPLY A MAN WHO IS RATHER LIBERAL THAN GOOD NATURED RATHER BRILLIANT
THAN GENIAL RATHER SCRUPULOUSLY EQUITABLE THAN TRULY JUST IF YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND SUCH SUPERFINE DISTINCTIONS
OH YES GOOD NATURE IMPLIES INDULGENCE WHICH HE HAS NOT GENIALITY
WARMTH OF HEART WHICH HE DOES NOT OWN AND GENUINE JUSTICE IS THE
OFFSPRING OF SYMPATHY AND CONSIDERATENESS OF WHICH I CAN WELL
CONCEIVE MY BRONZED OLD FRIEND IS QUITE INNOCENT
I OFTEN WONDER SHIRLEY WHETHER MOST MEN RESEMBLE MY UNCLE IN THEIR
DOMESTIC RELATIONS WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO BE NEW AND UNFAMILIAR TO
THEM IN ORDER TO SEEM AGREEABLE OR ESTIMABLE IN THEIR EYES AND WHETHER
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THEIR NATURES TO RETAIN A CONSTANT INTEREST AND
AFFECTION FOR THOSE THEY SEE EVERY DAY
I DON'T KNOW
I CAN'T CLEAR UP YOUR DOUBTS
I PONDER OVER SIMILAR ONES
MYSELF SOMETIMES
BUT TO TELL YOU A SECRET IF I WERE CONVINCED THAT
THEY ARE NECESSARILY AND UNIVERSALLY DIFFERENT FROM US FICKLE SOON
PETRIFYING UNSYMPATHIZING I WOULD NEVER MARRY
I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO
FIND OUT THAT WHAT I LOVED DID NOT LOVE ME THAT IT WAS WEARY OF ME AND
THAT WHATEVER EFFORT I MIGHT MAKE TO PLEASE WOULD HEREAFTER BE WORSE
THAN USELESS SINCE IT WAS INEVITABLY IN ITS NATURE TO CHANGE AND BECOME
INDIFFERENT
THAT DISCOVERY ONCE MADE WHAT SHOULD I LONG FOR TO GO
AWAY TO REMOVE FROM A PRESENCE WHERE MY SOCIETY GAVE NO PLEASURE
BUT YOU COULD NOT IF YOU WERE MARRIED
NO I COULD NOT
THERE IT IS
I COULD NEVER BE MY OWN MISTRESS MORE
A
TERRIBLE THOUGHT IT SUFFOCATES ME NOTHING IRKS ME LIKE THE IDEA OF
BEING A BURDEN AND A BORE AN INEVITABLE BURDEN A CEASELESS BORE NOW
WHEN I FEEL MY COMPANY SUPERFLUOUS I CAN COMFORTABLY FOLD MY
INDEPENDENCE ROUND ME LIKE A MANTLE AND DROP MY PRIDE LIKE A VEIL AND
WITHDRAW TO SOLITUDE
IF MARRIED THAT COULD NOT BE
I WONDER WE DON'T ALL MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO REMAIN SINGLE SAID
CAROLINE
WE SHOULD IF WE LISTENED TO THE WISDOM OF EXPERIENCE
MY
UNCLE ALWAYS SPEAKS OF MARRIAGE AS A BURDEN AND I BELIEVE WHENEVER HE
HEARS OF A MAN BEING MARRIED HE INVARIABLY REGARDS HIM AS A FOOL OR AT
ANY RATE AS DOING A FOOLISH THING
BUT CAROLINE MEN ARE NOT ALL LIKE YOUR UNCLE
SURELY NOT
I HOPE
NOT
SHE PAUSED AND MUSED
I SUPPOSE WE EACH FIND AN EXCEPTION IN THE ONE WE LOVE TILL WE ARE
MARRIED SUGGESTED CAROLINE
I SUPPOSE SO
AND THIS EXCEPTION WE BELIEVE TO BE OF STERLING
MATERIALS
WE FANCY IT LIKE OURSELVES WE IMAGINE A SENSE OF HARMONY
WE
THINK HIS VOICE GIVES THE SOFTEST TRUEST PROMISE OF A HEART THAT WILL
NEVER HARDEN AGAINST US WE READ IN HIS EYES THAT FAITHFUL
FEELING AFFECTION
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD TRUST TO WHAT THEY CALL
PASSION AT ALL CAROLINE
I BELIEVE IT IS A MERE FIRE OF DRY STICKS
BLAZING UP AND VANISHING
BUT WE WATCH HIM AND SEE HIM KIND TO ANIMALS
TO LITTLE CHILDREN TO POOR PEOPLE
HE IS KIND TO US LIKEWISE GOOD
CONSIDERATE
HE DOES NOT FLATTER WOMEN BUT HE IS PATIENT WITH THEM AND
HE SEEMS TO BE EASY IN THEIR PRESENCE AND TO FIND THEIR COMPANY GENIAL
HE LIKES THEM NOT ONLY FOR VAIN AND SELFISH REASONS BUT AS WE LIKE
HIM BECAUSE WE LIKE HIM
THEN WE OBSERVE THAT HE IS JUST THAT HE
ALWAYS SPEAKS THE TRUTH THAT HE IS CONSCIENTIOUS
WE FEEL JOY AND PEACE
WHEN HE COMES INTO A ROOM WE FEEL SADNESS AND TROUBLE WHEN HE LEAVES
IT
WE KNOW THAT THIS MAN HAS BEEN A KIND SON THAT HE IS A KIND
BROTHER
WILL ANY ONE DARE TO TELL ME THAT HE WILL NOT BE A KIND
HUSBAND
MY UNCLE WOULD AFFIRM IT UNHESITATINGLY
'HE WILL BE SICK OF YOU IN A
MONTH HE WOULD SAY
MRS
PRYOR WOULD SERIOUSLY INTIMATE THE SAME
MRS
YORKE AND MISS MANN WOULD DARKLY SUGGEST DITTO
IF THEY ARE TRUE ORACLES IT IS GOOD NEVER TO FALL IN LOVE
VERY GOOD IF YOU CAN AVOID IT
I CHOOSE TO DOUBT THEIR TRUTH
I AM AFRAID THAT PROVES YOU ARE ALREADY CAUGHT
NOT I
BUT IF I WERE DO YOU KNOW WHAT SOOTHSAYERS I WOULD CONSULT
LET ME HEAR
NEITHER MAN NOR WOMAN ELDERLY NOR YOUNG THE LITTLE IRISH BEGGAR THAT
COMES BAREFOOT TO MY DOOR THE MOUSE THAT STEALS OUT OF THE CRANNY IN
THE WAINSCOT THE BIRD THAT IN FROST AND SNOW PECKS AT MY WINDOW FOR A
CRUMB THE DOG THAT LICKS MY HAND AND SITS BESIDE MY KNEE
DID YOU EVER SEE ANY ONE WHO WAS KIND TO SUCH THINGS
DID YOU EVER SEE ANY ONE WHOM SUCH THINGS SEEMED INSTINCTIVELY TO
FOLLOW LIKE RELY ON
WE HAVE A BLACK CAT AND AN OLD DOG AT THE RECTORY
I KNOW SOMEBODY TO
WHOSE KNEE THAT BLACK CAT LOVES TO CLIMB AGAINST WHOSE SHOULDER AND
CHEEK IT LIKES TO PURR
THE OLD DOG ALWAYS COMES OUT OF HIS KENNEL AND
WAGS HIS TAIL AND WHINES AFFECTIONATELY WHEN SOMEBODY PASSES
AND WHAT DOES THAT SOMEBODY DO
HE QUIETLY STROKES THE CAT AND LETS HER SIT WHILE HE CONVENIENTLY CAN
AND WHEN HE MUST DISTURB HER BY RISING HE PUTS HER SOFTLY DOWN AND
NEVER FLINGS HER FROM HIM ROUGHLY
HE ALWAYS WHISTLES TO THE DOG AND
GIVES HIM A CARESS
DOES HE IT IS NOT ROBERT
BUT IT IS ROBERT
HANDSOME FELLOW SAID SHIRLEY WITH ENTHUSIASM
HER EYES SPARKLED
IS HE NOT HANDSOME HAS HE NOT FINE EYES AND WELL CUT FEATURES AND A
CLEAR PRINCELY FOREHEAD
HE HAS ALL THAT CAROLINE
BLESS HIM HE IS BOTH GRACEFUL AND GOOD
I WAS SURE YOU WOULD SEE THAT HE WAS
WHEN I FIRST LOOKED AT YOUR FACE
I KNEW YOU WOULD
I WAS WELL INCLINED TO HIM BEFORE I SAW HIM
I LIKED HIM WHEN I DID SEE
HIM
I ADMIRE HIM NOW
THERE IS CHARM IN BEAUTY FOR ITSELF CAROLINE
WHEN IT IS BLENT WITH GOODNESS THERE IS A POWERFUL CHARM
WHEN MIND IS ADDED SHIRLEY
WHO CAN RESIST IT
REMEMBER MY UNCLE MESDAMES PRYOR YORKE AND MANN
REMEMBER THE CROAKING OF THE FROGS OF EGYPT
HE IS A NOBLE BEING
I
TELL YOU WHEN THEY ARE GOOD THEY ARE THE LORDS OF THE CREATION THEY
ARE THE SONS OF GOD
MOULDED IN THEIR MAKER'S IMAGE THE MINUTEST SPARK
OF HIS SPIRIT LIFTS THEM ALMOST ABOVE MORTALITY
INDISPUTABLY A GREAT
GOOD HANDSOME MAN IS THE FIRST OF CREATED THINGS
ABOVE US
I WOULD SCORN TO CONTEND FOR EMPIRE WITH HIM I WOULD SCORN IT
SHALL
MY LEFT HAND DISPUTE FOR PRECEDENCE WITH MY RIGHT SHALL MY HEART
QUARREL WITH MY PULSE SHALL MY VEINS BE JEALOUS OF THE BLOOD WHICH
FILLS THEM
MEN AND WOMEN HUSBANDS AND WIVES QUARREL HORRIBLY SHIRLEY
POOR THINGS POOR FALLEN DEGENERATE THINGS GOD MADE THEM FOR ANOTHER
LOT FOR OTHER FEELINGS
BUT ARE WE MEN'S EQUALS OR ARE WE NOT
NOTHING EVER CHARMS ME MORE THAN WHEN I MEET MY SUPERIOR ONE WHO MAKES
ME SINCERELY FEEL THAT HE IS MY SUPERIOR
DID YOU EVER MEET HIM
I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HIM ANY DAY
THE HIGHER ABOVE ME SO MUCH THE
BETTER
IT DEGRADES TO STOOP IT IS GLORIOUS TO LOOK UP
WHAT FRETS ME
IS THAT WHEN I TRY TO ESTEEM I AM BAFFLED WHEN RELIGIOUSLY INCLINED
THERE ARE BUT FALSE GODS TO ADORE
I DISDAIN TO BE A PAGAN
MISS KEELDAR WILL YOU COME IN WE ARE HERE AT THE RECTORY GATES
NOT TO DAY BUT TO MORROW I SHALL FETCH YOU TO SPEND THE EVENING WITH
ME
CAROLINE HELSTONE IF YOU REALLY ARE WHAT AT PRESENT TO ME YOU SEEM
YOU AND I WILL SUIT
I HAVE NEVER IN MY WHOLE LIFE BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO
A YOUNG LADY AS I HAVE TALKED TO YOU THIS MORNING
KISS ME AND
GOOD BYE
MRS
PRYOR SEEMED AS WELL DISPOSED TO CULTIVATE CAROLINE'S ACQUAINTANCE
AS SHIRLEY
SHE WHO WENT NOWHERE ELSE CALLED ON AN EARLY DAY AT THE
RECTORY
SHE CAME IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE RECTOR HAPPENED TO BE OUT
IT WAS RATHER A CLOSE DAY THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER HAD FLUSHED HER AND
SHE SEEMED FLUTTERED TOO BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF ENTERING A STRANGE
HOUSE FOR IT APPEARED HER HABITS WERE MOST RETIRING AND SECLUDED
WHEN
MISS HELSTONE WENT TO HER IN THE DINING ROOM SHE FOUND HER SEATED ON THE
SOFA TREMBLING FANNING HERSELF WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF AND SEEMING TO
CONTEND WITH A NERVOUS DISCOMPOSURE THAT THREATENED TO BECOME
HYSTERICAL
CAROLINE MARVELLED SOMEWHAT AT THIS UNUSUAL WANT OF SELF COMMAND IN A
LADY OF HER YEARS AND ALSO AT THE LACK OF REAL STRENGTH IN ONE WHO
APPEARED ALMOST ROBUST FOR MRS
PRYOR HASTENED TO ALLEGE THE FATIGUE OF
HER WALK THE HEAT OF THE SUN ETC AS REASONS FOR HER TEMPORARY
INDISPOSITION AND STILL AS WITH MORE HURRY THAN COHERENCE SHE AGAIN
AND AGAIN ENUMERATED THESE CAUSES OF EXHAUSTION CAROLINE GENTLY SOUGHT
TO RELIEVE HER BY OPENING HER SHAWL AND REMOVING HER BONNET
ATTENTIONS
OF THIS SORT MRS
PRYOR WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED FROM EVERY ONE
IN
GENERAL SHE RECOILED FROM TOUCH OR CLOSE APPROACH WITH A MIXTURE OF
EMBARRASSMENT AND COLDNESS FAR FROM FLATTERING TO THOSE WHO OFFERED HER
AID
TO MISS HELSTONE'S LITTLE LIGHT HAND HOWEVER SHE YIELDED
TRACTABLY AND SEEMED SOOTHED BY ITS CONTACT
IN A FEW MINUTES SHE
CEASED TO TREMBLE AND GREW QUIET AND TRANQUIL
HER USUAL MANNER BEING RESUMED SHE PROCEEDED TO TALK OF ORDINARY
TOPICS
IN A MISCELLANEOUS COMPANY MRS
PRYOR RARELY OPENED HER LIPS
OR IF OBLIGED TO SPEAK SHE SPOKE UNDER RESTRAINT AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT
WELL IN DIALOGUE SHE WAS A GOOD CONVERSER
HER LANGUAGE ALWAYS A
LITTLE FORMAL WAS WELL CHOSEN HER SENTIMENTS WERE JUST HER
INFORMATION WAS VARIED AND CORRECT
CAROLINE FELT IT PLEASANT TO LISTEN
TO HER MORE PLEASANT THAN SHE COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED
ON THE WALL OPPOSITE THE SOFA WHERE THEY SAT HUNG THREE PICTURES THE
CENTRE ONE ABOVE THE MANTELPIECE THAT OF A LADY THE TWO OTHERS MALE
PORTRAITS
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL FACE SAID MRS
PRYOR INTERRUPTING A BRIEF PAUSE
WHICH HAD FOLLOWED HALF AN HOUR'S ANIMATED CONVERSATION
THE FEATURES
MAY BE TERMED PERFECT NO STATUARY'S CHISEL COULD IMPROVE THEM
IT IS A
PORTRAIT FROM THE LIFE I PRESUME
IT IS A PORTRAIT OF MRS
HELSTONE
OF MRS
MATTHEWSON HELSTONE OF YOUR UNCLE'S WIFE
IT IS AND IS SAID TO BE A GOOD LIKENESS
BEFORE HER MARRIAGE SHE WAS
ACCOUNTED THE BEAUTY OF THE DISTRICT
I SHOULD SAY SHE MERITED THE DISTINCTION
WHAT ACCURACY IN ALL THE
LINEAMENTS IT IS HOWEVER A PASSIVE FACE
THE ORIGINAL COULD NOT HAVE
BEEN WHAT IS GENERALLY TERMED 'A WOMAN OF SPIRIT
I BELIEVE SHE WAS A REMARKABLY STILL SILENT PERSON
ONE WOULD SCARCELY HAVE EXPECTED MY DEAR THAT YOUR UNCLE'S CHOICE
SHOULD HAVE FALLEN ON A PARTNER OF THAT DESCRIPTION
IS HE NOT FOND OF
BEING AMUSED BY LIVELY CHAT
IN COMPANY HE IS
BUT HE ALWAYS SAYS HE COULD NEVER DO WITH A TALKING
WIFE
HE MUST HAVE QUIET AT HOME
YOU GO OUT TO GOSSIP HE AFFIRMS YOU
COME HOME TO READ AND REFLECT
MRS
MATTHEWSON LIVED BUT A FEW YEARS AFTER HER MARRIAGE I THINK I
HAVE HEARD
ABOUT FIVE YEARS
WELL MY DEAR PURSUED MRS
PRYOR RISING TO GO I TRUST IT IS
UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU WILL FREQUENTLY COME TO FIELDHEAD
I HOPE YOU WILL
YOU MUST FEEL LONELY HERE HAVING NO FEMALE RELATIVE IN THE HOUSE YOU
MUST NECESSARILY PASS MUCH OF YOUR TIME IN SOLITUDE
I AM INURED TO IT
I HAVE GROWN UP BY MYSELF
MAY I ARRANGE YOUR SHAWL
FOR YOU
MRS
PRYOR SUBMITTED TO BE ASSISTED
SHOULD YOU CHANCE TO REQUIRE HELP IN YOUR STUDIES SHE SAID YOU MAY
COMMAND ME
CAROLINE EXPRESSED HER SENSE OF SUCH KINDNESS
I HOPE TO HAVE FREQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU
I SHOULD WISH TO BE OF
USE TO YOU
AGAIN MISS HELSTONE RETURNED THANKS
SHE THOUGHT WHAT A KIND HEART WAS
HIDDEN UNDER HER VISITOR'S SEEMING CHILLINESS
OBSERVING THAT MRS
PRYOR
AGAIN GLANCED WITH AN AIR OF INTEREST TOWARDS THE PORTRAITS AS SHE
WALKED DOWN THE ROOM CAROLINE CASUALLY EXPLAINED THE LIKENESS THAT
HANGS NEAR THE WINDOW YOU WILL SEE IS MY UNCLE TAKEN TWENTY YEARS
AGO THE OTHER TO THE LEFT OF THE MANTELPIECE IS HIS BROTHER JAMES MY
FATHER
THEY RESEMBLE EACH OTHER IN SOME MEASURE SAID MRS
PRYOR YET A
DIFFERENCE OF CHARACTER MAY BE TRACED IN THE DIFFERENT MOULD OF THE BROW
AND MOUTH
WHAT DIFFERENCE INQUIRED CAROLINE ACCOMPANYING HER TO THE DOOR
JAMES HELSTONE THAT IS MY FATHER IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED THE
BEST LOOKING OF THE TWO
STRANGERS I REMARK ALWAYS EXCLAIM 'WHAT A
HANDSOME MAN DO YOU THINK HIS PICTURE HANDSOME MRS
PRYOR
IT IS MUCH SOFTER OR FINER FEATURED THAN THAT OF YOUR UNCLE
BUT WHERE OR WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OF CHARACTER TO WHICH YOU ALLUDED
TELL ME
I WISH TO SEE IF YOU GUESS RIGHT
MY DEAR YOUR UNCLE IS A MAN OF PRINCIPLE
HIS FOREHEAD AND HIS LIPS
ARE FIRM AND HIS EYE IS STEADY
WELL AND THE OTHER DO NOT BE AFRAID OF OFFENDING ME
I ALWAYS LIKE
THE TRUTH
DO YOU LIKE THE TRUTH IT IS WELL FOR YOU
ADHERE TO THAT
PREFERENCE NEVER SWERVE THENCE
THE OTHER MY DEAR IF HE HAD BEEN
LIVING NOW WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FURNISHED LITTLE SUPPORT TO HIS
DAUGHTER
IT IS HOWEVER A GRACEFUL HEAD TAKEN IN YOUTH I SHOULD
THINK
MY DEAR TURNING ABRUPTLY YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AN INESTIMABLE
VALUE IN PRINCIPLE
I AM SURE NO CHARACTER CAN HAVE TRUE WORTH WITHOUT IT
YOU FEEL WHAT YOU SAY YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THE SUBJECT
OFTEN
CIRCUMSTANCES EARLY FORCED IT UPON MY ATTENTION
THE LESSON WAS NOT LOST THEN THOUGH IT CAME SO PREMATURELY
I SUPPOSE
THE SOIL IS NOT LIGHT NOR STONY OTHERWISE SEED FALLING IN THAT SEASON
NEVER WOULD HAVE BORNE FRUIT
MY DEAR DO NOT STAND IN THE AIR OF THE
DOOR YOU WILL TAKE COLD
GOOD AFTERNOON
MISS HELSTONE'S NEW ACQUAINTANCE SOON BECAME OF VALUE TO HER THEIR
SOCIETY WAS ACKNOWLEDGED A PRIVILEGE
SHE FOUND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN
ERROR INDEED TO HAVE LET SLIP THIS CHANCE OF RELIEF TO HAVE NEGLECTED
TO AVAIL HERSELF OF THIS HAPPY CHANGE
A TURN WAS THEREBY GIVEN TO HER
THOUGHTS A NEW CHANNEL WAS OPENED FOR THEM WHICH DIVERTING A FEW OF
THEM AT LEAST FROM THE ONE DIRECTION IN WHICH ALL HAD HITHERTO TENDED
ABATED THE IMPETUOSITY OF THEIR RUSH AND LESSENED THE FORCE OF THEIR
PRESSURE ON ONE WORN DOWN POINT
SOON SHE WAS CONTENT TO SPEND WHOLE DAYS AT FIELDHEAD DOING BY TURNS
WHATEVER SHIRLEY OR MRS
PRYOR WISHED HER TO DO AND NOW ONE WOULD CLAIM
HER NOW THE OTHER
NOTHING COULD BE LESS DEMONSTRATIVE THAN THE
FRIENDSHIP OF THE ELDER LADY BUT ALSO NOTHING COULD BE MORE VIGILANT
ASSIDUOUS UNTIRING
I HAVE INTIMATED THAT SHE WAS A PECULIAR PERSONAGE
AND IN NOTHING WAS HER PECULIARITY MORE SHOWN THAN IN THE NATURE OF THE
INTEREST SHE EVINCED FOR CAROLINE
SHE WATCHED ALL HER MOVEMENTS SHE
SEEMED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE GUARDED ALL HER STEPS
IT GAVE HER PLEASURE
TO BE APPLIED TO BY MISS HELSTONE FOR ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE
SHE YIELDED
HER AID WHEN ASKED WITH SUCH QUIET YET OBVIOUS ENJOYMENT THAT CAROLINE
ERE LONG TOOK DELIGHT IN DEPENDING ON HER
SHIRLEY KEELDAR'S COMPLETE DOCILITY WITH MRS
PRYOR HAD AT FIRST
SURPRISED MISS HELSTONE AND NOT LESS THE FACT OF THE RESERVED
EX GOVERNESS BEING SO MUCH AT HOME AND AT EASE IN THE RESIDENCE OF HER
YOUNG PUPIL WHERE SHE FILLED WITH SUCH QUIET INDEPENDENCY A VERY
DEPENDENT POST BUT SHE SOON FOUND THAT IT NEEDED BUT TO KNOW BOTH
LADIES TO COMPREHEND FULLY THE ENIGMA
EVERY ONE IT SEEMED TO HER MUST
LIKE MUST LOVE MUST PRIZE MRS
PRYOR WHEN THEY KNEW HER
NO MATTER
THAT SHE PERSEVERINGLY WORE OLD FASHIONED GOWNS THAT HER SPEECH WAS
FORMAL AND HER MANNER COOL THAT SHE HAD TWENTY LITTLE WAYS SUCH AS
NOBODY ELSE HAD SHE WAS STILL SUCH A STAY SUCH A COUNSELLOR SO
TRUTHFUL SO KIND IN HER WAY THAT IN CAROLINE'S IDEA NONE ONCE
ACCUSTOMED TO HER PRESENCE COULD EASILY AFFORD TO DISPENSE WITH IT
AS TO DEPENDENCY OR HUMILIATION CAROLINE DID NOT FEEL IT IN HER
INTERCOURSE WITH SHIRLEY AND WHY SHOULD MRS
PRYOR THE HEIRESS WAS
RICH VERY RICH COMPARED WITH HER NEW FRIEND ONE POSSESSED A CLEAR
THOUSAND A YEAR THE OTHER NOT A PENNY AND YET THERE WAS A SAFE SENSE
OF EQUALITY EXPERIENCED IN HER SOCIETY NEVER KNOWN IN THAT OF THE
ORDINARY BRIARFIELD AND WHINBURY GENTRY
THE REASON WAS SHIRLEY'S HEAD RAN ON OTHER THINGS THAN MONEY AND
POSITION
SHE WAS GLAD TO BE INDEPENDENT AS TO PROPERTY BY FITS SHE WAS
EVEN ELATED AT THE NOTION OF BEING LADY OF THE MANOR AND HAVING TENANTS
AND AN ESTATE
SHE WAS ESPECIALLY TICKLED WITH AN AGREEABLE COMPLACENCY
WHEN REMINDED OF ALL THAT PROPERTY DOWN IN THE HOLLOW COMPRISING AN
EXCELLENT CLOTH MILL DYEHOUSE WAREHOUSE TOGETHER WITH THE MESSUAGE
GARDENS AND OUTBUILDINGS TERMED HOLLOW'S COTTAGE BUT HER EXULTATION
BEING QUITE UNDISGUISED WAS SINGULARLY INOFFENSIVE AND FOR HER SERIOUS
THOUGHTS THEY TENDED ELSEWHERE
TO ADMIRE THE GREAT REVERENCE THE
GOOD AND BE JOYOUS WITH THE GENIAL WAS VERY MUCH THE BENT OF SHIRLEY'S
SOUL SHE MUSED THEREFORE ON THE MEANS OF FOLLOWING THIS BENT FAR
OFTENER THAN SHE PONDERED ON HER SOCIAL SUPERIORITY
IN CAROLINE MISS KEELDAR HAD FIRST TAKEN AN INTEREST BECAUSE SHE WAS
QUIET RETIRING LOOKED DELICATE AND SEEMED AS IF SHE NEEDED SOME ONE
TO TAKE CARE OF HER
HER PREDILECTION INCREASED GREATLY WHEN SHE
DISCOVERED THAT HER OWN WAY OF THINKING AND TALKING WAS UNDERSTOOD AND
RESPONDED TO BY THIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE
SHE HAD HARDLY EXPECTED IT
MISS
HELSTONE SHE FANCIED HAD TOO PRETTY A FACE MANNERS AND VOICE TOO
SOFT TO BE ANYTHING OUT OF THE COMMON WAY IN MIND AND ATTAINMENTS AND
SHE VERY MUCH WONDERED TO SEE THE GENTLE FEATURES LIGHT UP ARCHLY TO THE
REVEILLE OF A DRY SALLY OR TWO RISKED BY HERSELF AND MORE DID SHE
WONDER TO DISCOVER THE SELF WON KNOWLEDGE TREASURED AND THE UNTAUGHT
SPECULATIONS WORKING IN THAT GIRLISH CURL VEILED HEAD
CAROLINE'S
INSTINCT OF TASTE TOO WAS LIKE HER OWN
SUCH BOOKS AS MISS KEELDAR HAD
READ WITH THE MOST PLEASURE WERE MISS HELSTONE'S DELIGHT ALSO
THEY HELD
MANY AVERSIONS TOO IN COMMON AND COULD HAVE THE COMFORT OF LAUGHING
TOGETHER OVER WORKS OF FALSE SENTIMENTALITY AND POMPOUS PRETENSION
FEW SHIRLEY CONCEIVED MEN OR WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TASTE IN POETRY THE
RIGHT SENSE FOR DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS FALSE
SHE HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN HEARD VERY CLEVER PEOPLE PRONOUNCE THIS OR THAT
PASSAGE IN THIS OR THAT VERSIFIER ALTOGETHER ADMIRABLE WHICH WHEN
SHE READ HER SOUL REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE AS ANYTHING BUT CANT
FLOURISH AND TINSEL OR AT THE BEST ELABORATE WORDINESS CURIOUS
CLEVER LEARNED PERHAPS HAPLY EVEN TINGED WITH THE FASCINATING HUES OF
FANCY BUT GOD KNOWS AS DIFFERENT FROM REAL POETRY AS THE GORGEOUS AND
MASSY VASE OF MOSAIC IS FROM THE LITTLE CUP OF PURE METAL OR TO GIVE
THE READER A CHOICE OF SIMILES AS THE MILLINER'S ARTIFICIAL WREATH IS
FROM THE FRESH GATHERED LILY OF THE FIELD
CAROLINE SHE FOUND FELT THE VALUE OF THE TRUE ORE AND KNEW THE
DECEPTION OF THE FLASHY DROSS
THE MINDS OF THE TWO GIRLS BEING TONED IN
HARMONY OFTEN CHIMED VERY SWEETLY TOGETHER
ONE EVENING THEY CHANCED TO BE ALONE IN THE OAK PARLOUR
THEY HAD PASSED
A LONG WET DAY TOGETHER WITHOUT ENNUI
IT WAS NOW ON THE EDGE OF DARK
CANDLES WERE NOT YET BROUGHT IN BOTH AS TWILIGHT DEEPENED GREW
MEDITATIVE AND SILENT
A WESTERN WIND ROARED HIGH ROUND THE HALL
DRIVING WILD CLOUDS AND STORMY RAIN UP FROM THE FAR REMOTE OCEAN ALL
WAS TEMPEST OUTSIDE THE ANTIQUE LATTICES ALL DEEP PEACE WITHIN
SHIRLEY
SAT AT THE WINDOW WATCHING THE RACK IN HEAVEN THE MIST ON EARTH
LISTENING TO CERTAIN NOTES OF THE GALE THAT PLAINED LIKE RESTLESS
SPIRITS NOTES WHICH HAD SHE NOT BEEN SO YOUNG GAY AND HEALTHY WOULD
HAVE SWEPT HER TREMBLING NERVES LIKE SOME OMEN SOME ANTICIPATORY DIRGE
IN THIS HER PRIME OF EXISTENCE AND BLOOM OF BEAUTY THEY BUT SUBDUED
VIVACITY TO PENSIVENESS
SNATCHES OF SWEET BALLADS HAUNTED HER EAR NOW
AND THEN SHE SANG A STANZA
HER ACCENTS OBEYED THE FITFUL IMPULSE OF THE
WIND THEY SWELLED AS ITS GUSTS RUSHED ON AND DIED AS THEY WANDERED
AWAY
CAROLINE WITHDRAWN TO THE FARTHEST AND DARKEST END OF THE ROOM
HER FIGURE JUST DISCERNIBLE BY THE RUBY SHINE OF THE FLAMELESS FIRE
WAS PACING TO AND FRO MUTTERING TO HERSELF FRAGMENTS OF WELL REMEMBERED
POETRY
SHE SPOKE VERY LOW BUT SHIRLEY HEARD HER AND WHILE SINGING
SOFTLY SHE LISTENED
THIS WAS THE STRAIN
OBSCUREST NIGHT INVOLVED THE SKY
THE ATLANTIC BILLOWS ROARED
WHEN SUCH A DESTINED WRETCH AS I
WASHED HEADLONG FROM ON BOARD
OF FRIENDS OF HOPE OF ALL BEREFT
HIS FLOATING HOME FOR EVER LEFT
HERE THE FRAGMENT STOPPED BECAUSE SHIRLEY'S SONG EREWHILE SOMEWHAT
FULL AND THRILLING HAD BECOME DELICATELY FAINT
GO ON SAID SHE
THEN YOU GO ON TOO
I WAS ONLY REPEATING 'THE CASTAWAY
I KNOW
IF YOU CAN REMEMBER IT ALL SAY IT ALL
AND AS IT WAS NEARLY DARK AND AFTER ALL MISS KEELDAR WAS NO
FORMIDABLE AUDITOR CAROLINE WENT THROUGH IT
SHE WENT THROUGH IT AS SHE
SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH IT
THE WILD SEA THE DROWNING MARINER THE
RELUCTANT SHIP SWEPT ON IN THE STORM YOU HEARD WERE REALIZED BY HER
AND MORE VIVIDLY WAS REALIZED THE HEART OF THE POET WHO DID NOT WEEP
FOR THE CASTAWAY BUT WHO IN AN HOUR OF TEARLESS ANGUISH TRACED A
SEMBLANCE TO HIS OWN GOD ABANDONED MISERY IN THE FATE OF THAT
MAN FORSAKEN SAILOR AND CRIED FROM THE DEPTHS WHERE HE STRUGGLED
NO VOICE DIVINE THE STORM ALLAYED
NO LIGHT PROPITIOUS SHONE
WHEN SNATCHED FROM ALL EFFECTUAL AID
WE PERISHED EACH ALONE
BUT I BENEATH A ROUGHER SEA
AND WHELMED IN DEEPER GULFS THAN HE
I HOPE WILLIAM COWPER IS SAFE AND CALM IN HEAVEN NOW SAID CAROLINE
DO YOU PITY WHAT HE SUFFERED ON EARTH ASKED MISS KEELDAR
PITY HIM SHIRLEY WHAT CAN I DO ELSE HE WAS NEARLY BROKEN HEARTED
WHEN HE WROTE THAT POEM AND IT ALMOST BREAKS ONE'S HEART TO READ IT
BUT HE FOUND RELIEF IN WRITING IT I KNOW HE DID AND THAT GIFT OF
POETRY THE MOST DIVINE BESTOWED ON MAN WAS I BELIEVE GRANTED TO
ALLAY EMOTIONS WHEN THEIR STRENGTH THREATENS HARM
IT SEEMS TO ME
SHIRLEY THAT NOBODY SHOULD WRITE POETRY TO EXHIBIT INTELLECT OR
ATTAINMENT
WHO CARES FOR THAT SORT OF POETRY WHO CARES FOR
LEARNING WHO CARES FOR FINE WORDS IN POETRY AND WHO DOES NOT CARE FOR
FEELING REAL FEELING HOWEVER SIMPLY EVEN RUDELY EXPRESSED
IT SEEMS YOU CARE FOR IT AT ALL EVENTS AND CERTAINLY IN HEARING THAT
POEM ONE DISCOVERS THAT COWPER WAS UNDER AN IMPULSE STRONG AS THAT OF
THE WIND WHICH DROVE THE SHIP AN IMPULSE WHICH WHILE IT WOULD NOT
SUFFER HIM TO STOP TO ADD ORNAMENT TO A SINGLE STANZA FILLED HIM WITH
FORCE TO ACHIEVE THE WHOLE WITH CONSUMMATE PERFECTION
YOU MANAGED TO
RECITE IT WITH A STEADY VOICE CAROLINE
I WONDER THEREAT
COWPER'S HAND DID NOT TREMBLE IN WRITING THE LINES
WHY SHOULD MY VOICE
FALTER IN REPEATING THEM DEPEND ON IT SHIRLEY NO TEAR BLISTERED THE
MANUSCRIPT OF 'THE CASTAWAY I HEAR IN IT NO SOB OF SORROW ONLY THE
CRY OF DESPAIR BUT THAT CRY UTTERED I BELIEVE THE DEADLY SPASM PASSED
FROM HIS HEART THAT HE WEPT ABUNDANTLY AND WAS COMFORTED
SHIRLEY RESUMED HER BALLAD MINSTRELSY
STOPPING SHORT SHE REMARKED ERE
LONG ONE COULD HAVE LOVED COWPER IF IT WERE ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF
HAVING THE PRIVILEGE OF COMFORTING HIM
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE LOVED COWPER REJOINED CAROLINE PROMPTLY
HE WAS
NOT MADE TO BE LOVED BY WOMAN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT I SAY
I KNOW THERE IS A KIND OF NATURES IN THE WORLD AND VERY
NOBLE ELEVATED NATURES TOO WHOM LOVE NEVER COMES NEAR
YOU MIGHT HAVE
SOUGHT COWPER WITH THE INTENTION OF LOVING HIM AND YOU WOULD HAVE
LOOKED AT HIM PITIED HIM AND LEFT HIM FORCED AWAY BY A SENSE OF THE
IMPOSSIBLE THE INCONGRUOUS AS THE CREW WERE BORNE FROM THEIR DROWNING
COMRADE BY 'THE FURIOUS BLAST
YOU MAY BE RIGHT
WHO TOLD YOU THIS
AND WHAT I SAY OF COWPER I SHOULD SAY OF ROUSSEAU
WAS ROUSSEAU EVER
LOVED HE LOVED PASSIONATELY BUT WAS HIS PASSION EVER RETURNED I AM
CERTAIN NEVER
AND IF THERE WERE ANY FEMALE COWPERS AND ROUSSEAUS I
SHOULD ASSERT THE SAME OF THEM
WHO TOLD YOU THIS I ASK DID MOORE
WHY SHOULD ANYBODY HAVE TOLD ME HAVE I NOT AN INSTINCT CAN I NOT
DIVINE BY ANALOGY MOORE NEVER TALKED TO ME EITHER ABOUT COWPER OR
ROUSSEAU OR LOVE
THE VOICE WE HEAR IN SOLITUDE TOLD ME ALL I KNOW ON
THESE SUBJECTS
DO YOU LIKE CHARACTERS OF THE ROUSSEAU ORDER CAROLINE
NOT AT ALL AS A WHOLE
I SYMPATHIZE INTENSELY WITH CERTAIN QUALITIES
THEY POSSESS
CERTAIN DIVINE SPARKS IN THEIR NATURE DAZZLE MY EYES AND
MAKE MY SOUL GLOW
THEN AGAIN I SCORN THEM
THEY ARE MADE OF CLAY AND
GOLD
THE REFUSE AND THE ORE MAKE A MASS OF WEAKNESS TAKEN ALTOGETHER
I FEEL THEM UNNATURAL UNHEALTHY REPULSIVE
I DARE SAY I SHOULD BE MORE TOLERANT OF A ROUSSEAU THAN YOU WOULD
CARY
SUBMISSIVE AND CONTEMPLATIVE YOURSELF YOU LIKE THE STERN AND THE
PRACTICAL
BY THE WAY YOU MUST MISS THAT COUSIN ROBERT OF YOURS VERY
MUCH NOW THAT YOU AND HE NEVER MEET
I DO
AND HE MUST MISS YOU
THAT HE DOES NOT
I CANNOT IMAGINE PURSUED SHIRLEY WHO HAD LATELY GOT A HABIT OF
INTRODUCING MOORE'S NAME INTO THE CONVERSATION EVEN WHEN IT SEEMED TO
HAVE NO BUSINESS THERE I CANNOT IMAGINE BUT THAT HE WAS FOND OF YOU
SINCE HE TOOK SO MUCH NOTICE OF YOU TALKED TO YOU AND TAUGHT YOU SO
MUCH
HE NEVER WAS FOND OF ME HE NEVER PROFESSED TO BE FOND OF ME
HE TOOK
PAINS TO PROVE THAT HE ONLY JUST TOLERATED ME
CAROLINE DETERMINED NOT TO ERR ON THE FLATTERING SIDE IN ESTIMATING HER
COUSIN'S REGARD FOR HER ALWAYS NOW HABITUALLY THOUGHT OF IT AND
MENTIONED IT IN THE MOST SCANTY MEASURE
SHE HAD HER OWN REASONS FOR
BEING LESS SANGUINE THAN EVER IN HOPEFUL VIEWS OF THE FUTURE LESS
INDULGENT TO PLEASURABLE RETROSPECTIONS OF THE PAST
OF COURSE THEN OBSERVED MISS KEELDAR YOU ONLY JUST TOLERATED HIM
IN RETURN
SHIRLEY MEN AND WOMEN ARE SO DIFFERENT THEY ARE IN SUCH A DIFFERENT
POSITION
WOMEN HAVE SO FEW THINGS TO THINK ABOUT MEN SO MANY
YOU MAY
HAVE A FRIENDSHIP FOR A MAN WHILE HE IS ALMOST INDIFFERENT TO YOU
MUCH
OF WHAT CHEERS YOUR LIFE MAY BE DEPENDENT ON HIM WHILE NOT A FEELING OR
INTEREST OF MOMENT IN HIS EYES MAY HAVE REFERENCE TO YOU
ROBERT USED TO
BE IN THE HABIT OF GOING TO LONDON SOMETIMES FOR A WEEK OR A FORTNIGHT
TOGETHER
WELL WHILE HE WAS AWAY I FOUND HIS ABSENCE A VOID
THERE
WAS SOMETHING WANTING BRIARFIELD WAS DULLER
OF COURSE I HAD MY USUAL
OCCUPATIONS STILL I MISSED HIM
AS I SAT BY MYSELF IN THE EVENINGS I
USED TO FEEL A STRANGE CERTAINTY OF CONVICTION I CANNOT DESCRIBE THAT
IF A MAGICIAN OR A GENIUS HAD AT THAT MOMENT OFFERED ME PRINCE ALI'S
TUBE YOU REMEMBER IT IN THE 'ARABIAN NIGHTS' AND IF WITH ITS AID I
HAD BEEN ENABLED TO TAKE A VIEW OF ROBERT TO SEE WHERE HE WAS HOW
OCCUPIED I SHOULD HAVE LEARNED IN A STARTLING MANNER THE WIDTH OF THE
CHASM WHICH GAPED BETWEEN SUCH AS HE AND SUCH AS I
I KNEW THAT HOWEVER
MY THOUGHTS MIGHT ADHERE TO HIM HIS WERE EFFECTUALLY SUNDERED FROM ME
CAROLINE DEMANDED MISS KEELDAR ABRUPTLY DON'T YOU WISH YOU HAD A
PROFESSION A TRADE
I WISH IT FIFTY TIMES A DAY
AS IT IS I OFTEN WONDER WHAT I CAME INTO
THE WORLD FOR
I LONG TO HAVE SOMETHING ABSORBING AND COMPULSORY TO FILL
MY HEAD AND HANDS AND TO OCCUPY MY THOUGHTS
CAN LABOUR ALONE MAKE A HUMAN BEING HAPPY
NO BUT IT CAN GIVE VARIETIES OF PAIN AND PREVENT US FROM BREAKING OUR
HEARTS WITH A SINGLE TYRANT MASTER TORTURE
BESIDES SUCCESSFUL LABOUR
HAS ITS RECOMPENSE A VACANT WEARY LONELY HOPELESS LIFE HAS NONE
BUT HARD LABOUR AND LEARNED PROFESSIONS THEY SAY MAKE WOMEN
MASCULINE COARSE UNWOMANLY
AND WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY WHETHER UNMARRIED AND NEVER TO BE MARRIED
WOMEN ARE UNATTRACTIVE AND INELEGANT OR NOT PROVIDED ONLY THEY ARE
DECENT DECOROUS AND NEAT IT IS ENOUGH
THE UTMOST WHICH OUGHT TO BE
REQUIRED OF OLD MAIDS IN THE WAY OF APPEARANCE IS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT
ABSOLUTELY OFFEND MEN'S EYES AS THEY PASS THEM IN THE STREET FOR THE
REST THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED WITHOUT TOO MUCH SCORN TO BE AS ABSORBED
GRAVE PLAIN LOOKING AND PLAIN DRESSED AS THEY PLEASE
YOU MIGHT BE AN OLD MAID YOURSELF CAROLINE YOU SPEAK SO EARNESTLY
I SHALL BE ONE
IT IS MY DESTINY
I WILL NEVER MARRY A MALONE OR A
SYKES AND NO ONE ELSE WILL EVER MARRY ME
HERE FELL A LONG PAUSE
SHIRLEY BROKE IT
AGAIN THE NAME BY WHICH SHE
SEEMED BEWITCHED WAS ALMOST THE FIRST ON HER LIPS
LINA DID NOT MOORE CALL YOU LINA SOMETIMES
YES
IT IS SOMETIMES USED AS THE ABBREVIATION OF CAROLINE IN HIS NATIVE
COUNTRY
WELL LINA DO YOU REMEMBER MY ONE DAY NOTICING AN INEQUALITY IN YOUR
HAIR A CURL WANTING ON THAT RIGHT SIDE AND YOUR TELLING ME THAT IT WAS
ROBERT'S FAULT AS HE HAD ONCE CUT THEREFROM A LONG LOCK
YES
IF HE IS AND ALWAYS WAS AS INDIFFERENT TO YOU AS YOU SAY WHY DID HE
STEAL YOUR HAIR
I DON'T KNOW YES I DO
IT WAS MY DOING NOT HIS
EVERYTHING OF THAT
SORT ALWAYS WAS MY DOING
HE WAS GOING FROM HOME TO LONDON AS USUAL
AND THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT I HAD FOUND IN HIS SISTER'S WORKBOX A LOCK
OF BLACK HAIR A SHORT ROUND CURL
HORTENSE TOLD ME IT WAS HER
BROTHER'S AND A KEEPSAKE
HE WAS SITTING NEAR THE TABLE
I LOOKED AT
HIS HEAD
HE HAS PLENTY OF HAIR ON THE TEMPLES WERE MANY SUCH ROUND
CURLS
I THOUGHT HE COULD SPARE ME ONE
I KNEW I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT
AND I ASKED FOR IT
HE SAID ON CONDITION THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HIS CHOICE
OF A TRESS FROM MY HEAD
SO HE GOT ONE OF MY LONG LOCKS OF HAIR AND I
GOT ONE OF HIS SHORT ONES
I KEEP HIS BUT I DARE SAY HE HAS LOST MINE
IT WAS MY DOING AND ONE OF THOSE SILLY DEEDS IT DISTRESSES THE HEART
AND SETS THE FACE ON FIRE TO THINK OF ONE OF THOSE SMALL BUT SHARP
RECOLLECTIONS THAT RETURN LACERATING YOUR SELF RESPECT LIKE TINY
PENKNIVES AND FORCING FROM YOUR LIPS AS YOU SIT ALONE SUDDEN
INSANE SOUNDING INTERJECTIONS
CAROLINE
I DO THINK MYSELF A FOOL SHIRLEY IN SOME RESPECTS I DO DESPISE
MYSELF
BUT I SAID I WOULD NOT MAKE YOU MY CONFESSOR FOR YOU CANNOT
RECIPROCATE FOIBLE FOR FOIBLE YOU ARE NOT WEAK
HOW STEADILY YOU WATCH
ME NOW TURN ASIDE YOUR CLEAR STRONG SHE EAGLE EYE IT IS AN INSULT TO
FIX IT ON ME THUS
WHAT A STUDY OF CHARACTER YOU ARE WEAK CERTAINLY BUT NOT IN THE
SENSE YOU THINK COME IN
THIS WAS SAID IN ANSWER TO A TAP AT THE DOOR
MISS KEELDAR HAPPENED TO
BE NEAR IT AT THE MOMENT CAROLINE AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
SHE SAW
A NOTE PUT INTO SHIRLEY'S HANDS AND HEARD THE WORDS FROM MR
MOORE
MA'AM
BRING CANDLES SAID MISS KEELDAR
CAROLINE SAT EXPECTANT
A COMMUNICATION ON BUSINESS SAID THE HEIRESS BUT WHEN CANDLES WERE
BROUGHT SHE NEITHER OPENED NOR READ IT
THE RECTOR'S FANNY WAS
PRESENTLY ANNOUNCED AND THE RECTOR'S NIECE WENT HOME
CHAPTER XIII
FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS ON BUSINESS
IN SHIRLEY'S NATURE PREVAILED AT TIMES AN EASY INDOLENCE
THERE WERE
PERIODS WHEN SHE TOOK DELIGHT IN PERFECT VACANCY OF HAND AND
EYE MOMENTS WHEN HER THOUGHTS HER SIMPLE EXISTENCE THE FACT OF THE
WORLD BEING AROUND AND HEAVEN ABOVE HER SEEMED TO YIELD HER SUCH
FULLNESS OF HAPPINESS THAT SHE DID NOT NEED TO LIFT A FINGER TO INCREASE
THE JOY
OFTEN AFTER AN ACTIVE MORNING SHE WOULD SPEND A SUNNY
AFTERNOON IN LYING STIRLESS ON THE TURF AT THE FOOT OF SOME TREE OF
FRIENDLY UMBRAGE
NO SOCIETY DID SHE NEED BUT THAT OF CAROLINE AND IT
SUFFICED IF SHE WERE WITHIN CALL NO SPECTACLE DID SHE ASK BUT THAT OF
THE DEEP BLUE SKY AND SUCH CLOUDLETS AS SAILED AFAR AND ALOFT ACROSS
ITS SPAN NO SOUND BUT THAT OF THE BEE'S HUM THE LEAF'S WHISPER
HER
SOLE BOOK IN SUCH HOURS WAS THE DIM CHRONICLE OF MEMORY OR THE SIBYL
PAGE OF ANTICIPATION
FROM HER YOUNG EYES FELL ON EACH VOLUME A GLORIOUS
LIGHT TO READ BY ROUND HER LIPS AT MOMENTS PLAYED A SMILE WHICH
REVEALED GLIMPSES OF THE TALE OR PROPHECY
IT WAS NOT SAD NOT DARK
FATE HAD BEEN BENIGN TO THE BLISSFUL DREAMER AND PROMISED TO FAVOUR HER
YET AGAIN
IN HER PAST WERE SWEET PASSAGES IN HER FUTURE ROSY HOPES
YET ONE DAY WHEN CAROLINE DREW NEAR TO ROUSE HER THINKING SHE HAD LAIN
LONG ENOUGH BEHOLD AS SHE LOOKED DOWN SHIRLEY'S CHEEK WAS WET AS IF
WITH DEW THOSE FINE EYES OF HERS SHONE HUMID AND BRIMMING
SHIRLEY WHY DO YOU CRY ASKED CAROLINE INVOLUNTARILY LAYING STRESS
ON YOU
MISS KEELDAR SMILED AND TURNED HER PICTURESQUE HEAD TOWARDS THE
QUESTIONER
BECAUSE IT PLEASES ME MIGHTILY TO CRY SHE SAID
MY HEART
IS BOTH SAD AND GLAD
BUT WHY YOU GOOD PATIENT CHILD WHY DO YOU NOT
BEAR ME COMPANY I ONLY WEEP TEARS DELIGHTFUL AND SOON WIPED AWAY YOU
MIGHT WEEP GALL IF YOU CHOOSE
WHY SHOULD I WEEP GALL
MATELESS SOLITARY BIRD WAS THE ONLY ANSWER
AND ARE NOT YOU TOO MATELESS SHIRLEY
AT HEART NO
OH WHO NESTLES THERE SHIRLEY
BUT SHIRLEY ONLY LAUGHED GAILY AT THIS QUESTION AND ALERTLY STARTED UP
I HAVE DREAMED SHE SAID A MERE DAY DREAM CERTAINLY BRIGHT
PROBABLY BASELESS
MISS HELSTONE WAS BY THIS TIME FREE ENOUGH FROM ILLUSIONS SHE TOOK A
SUFFICIENTLY GRAVE VIEW OF THE FUTURE AND FANCIED SHE KNEW PRETTY WELL
HOW HER OWN DESTINY AND THAT OF SOME OTHERS WERE TENDING
YET OLD
ASSOCIATIONS RETAINED THEIR INFLUENCE OVER HER AND IT WAS THESE AND THE
POWER OF HABIT WHICH STILL FREQUENTLY DREW HER OF AN EVENING TO THE
FIELD STYLE AND THE OLD THORN OVERLOOKING THE HOLLOW
ONE NIGHT THE NIGHT AFTER THE INCIDENT OF THE NOTE SHE HAD BEEN AT HER
USUAL POST WATCHING FOR HER BEACON WATCHING VAINLY THAT EVENING NO
LAMP WAS LIT
SHE WAITED TILL THE RISING OF CERTAIN CONSTELLATIONS
WARNED HER OF LATENESS AND SIGNED HER AWAY
IN PASSING FIELDHEAD ON HER
RETURN ITS MOONLIGHT BEAUTY ATTRACTED HER GLANCE AND STAYED HER STEP
AN INSTANT
TREE AND HALL ROSE PEACEFUL UNDER THE NIGHT SKY AND CLEAR
FULL ORB PEARLY PALENESS GILDED THE BUILDING MELLOW BROWN GLOOM
BOSOMED IT ROUND SHADOWS OF DEEP GREEN BROODED ABOVE ITS OAK WREATHED
ROOF
THE BROAD PAVEMENT IN FRONT SHONE PALE ALSO IT GLEAMED AS IF SOME
SPELL HAD TRANSFORMED THE DARK GRANITE TO GLISTERING PARIAN
ON THE
SILVERY SPACE SLEPT TWO SABLE SHADOWS THROWN SHARPLY DEFINED FROM TWO
HUMAN FIGURES
THESE FIGURES WHEN FIRST SEEN WERE MOTIONLESS AND MUTE
PRESENTLY THEY MOVED IN HARMONIOUS STEP AND SPOKE LOW IN HARMONIOUS
KEY
EARNEST WAS THE GAZE THAT SCRUTINIZED THEM AS THEY EMERGED FROM
BEHIND THE TRUNK OF THE CEDAR
IS IT MRS
PRYOR AND SHIRLEY
CERTAINLY IT IS SHIRLEY
WHO ELSE HAS A SHAPE SO LITHE AND PROUD AND
GRACEFUL AND HER FACE TOO IS VISIBLE HER COUNTENANCE CARELESS AND
PENSIVE AND MUSING AND MIRTHFUL AND MOCKING AND TENDER
NOT FEARING
THE DEW SHE HAS NOT COVERED HER HEAD HER CURLS ARE FREE THEY VEIL HER
NECK AND CARESS HER SHOULDER WITH THEIR TENDRIL RINGS
AN ORNAMENT OF
GOLD GLEAMS THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED FOLDS OF THE SCARF SHE HAS WRAPPED
ACROSS HER BUST AND A LARGE BRIGHT GEM GLITTERS ON THE WHITE HAND
WHICH CONFINES IT
YES THAT IS SHIRLEY
HER COMPANION THEN IS OF COURSE MRS
PRYOR
YES IF MRS
PRYOR OWNS SIX FEET OF STATURE AND IF SHE HAS CHANGED HER
DECENT WIDOW'S WEEDS FOR MASCULINE DISGUISE
THE FIGURE WALKING AT MISS
KEELDAR'S SIDE IS A MAN A TALL YOUNG STATELY MAN IT IS HER TENANT
ROBERT MOORE
THE PAIR SPEAK SOFTLY THEIR WORDS ARE NOT DISTINGUISHABLE
TO REMAIN A
MOMENT TO GAZE IS NOT TO BE AN EAVESDROPPER AND AS THE MOON SHINES SO
CLEARLY AND THEIR COUNTENANCES ARE SO DISTINCTLY APPARENT WHO CAN
RESIST THE ATTRACTION OF SUCH INTEREST CAROLINE IT SEEMS CANNOT FOR
SHE LINGERS
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN ON SUMMER NIGHTS MOORE HAD BEEN WONT TO WALK
WITH HIS COUSIN AS HE WAS NOW WALKING WITH THE HEIRESS
OFTEN HAD SHE
GONE UP THE HOLLOW WITH HIM AFTER SUNSET TO SCENT THE FRESHNESS OF THE
EARTH WHERE A GROWTH OF FRAGRANT HERBAGE CARPETED A CERTAIN NARROW
TERRACE EDGING A DEEP RAVINE FROM WHOSE RIFTED GLOOM WAS HEARD A SOUND
LIKE THE SPIRIT OF THE LONELY WATERCOURSE MOANING AMONGST ITS WET
STONES AND BETWEEN ITS WEEDY BANKS AND UNDER ITS DARK BOWER OF ALDERS
BUT I USED TO BE CLOSER TO HIM THOUGHT CAROLINE
HE FELT NO
OBLIGATION TO TREAT ME WITH HOMAGE I NEEDED ONLY KINDNESS
HE USED TO
HOLD MY HAND HE DOES NOT TOUCH HERS
AND YET SHIRLEY IS NOT PROUD WHERE
SHE LOVES
THERE IS NO HAUGHTINESS IN HER ASPECT NOW ONLY A LITTLE IN
HER PORT WHAT IS NATURAL TO AND INSEPARABLE FROM HER WHAT SHE RETAINS
IN HER MOST CARELESS AS IN HER MOST GUARDED MOMENTS
ROBERT MUST THINK
AS I THINK THAT HE IS AT THIS INSTANT LOOKING DOWN ON A FINE FACE AND
HE MUST THINK IT WITH A MAN'S BRAIN NOT WITH MINE
SHE HAS SUCH
GENEROUS YET SOFT FIRE IN HER EYES
SHE SMILES WHAT MAKES HER SMILE SO
SWEET I SAW THAT ROBERT FELT ITS BEAUTY AND HE MUST HAVE FELT IT WITH
HIS MAN'S HEART NOT WITH MY DIM WOMAN'S PERCEPTIONS
THEY LOOK TO ME
LIKE TWO GREAT HAPPY SPIRITS
YONDER SILVERED PAVEMENT REMINDS ME OF
THAT WHITE SHORE WE BELIEVE TO BE BEYOND THE DEATH FLOOD
THEY HAVE
REACHED IT THEY WALK THERE UNITED
AND WHAT AM I STANDING HERE IN
SHADOW SHRINKING INTO CONCEALMENT MY MIND DARKER THAN MY HIDING PLACE
I AM ONE OF THIS WORLD NO SPIRIT A POOR DOOMED MORTAL WHO ASKS IN
IGNORANCE AND HOPELESSNESS WHEREFORE SHE WAS BORN TO WHAT END SHE
LIVES WHOSE MIND FOR EVER RUNS ON THE QUESTION HOW SHE SHALL AT LAST
ENCOUNTER AND BY WHOM BE SUSTAINED THROUGH DEATH
THIS IS THE WORST PASSAGE I HAVE COME TO YET STILL I WAS QUITE
PREPARED FOR IT
I GAVE ROBERT UP AND GAVE HIM UP TO SHIRLEY THE FIRST
DAY I HEARD SHE WAS COME THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW HER RICH YOUTHFUL
AND LOVELY
SHE HAS HIM NOW
HE IS HER LOVER
SHE IS HIS DARLING
SHE
WILL BE FAR MORE HIS DARLING YET WHEN THEY ARE MARRIED
THE MORE ROBERT
KNOWS OF SHIRLEY THE MORE HIS SOUL WILL CLEAVE TO HER
THEY WILL BOTH BE
HAPPY AND I DO NOT GRUDGE THEM THEIR BLISS BUT I GROAN UNDER MY OWN
MISERY
SOME OF MY SUFFERING IS VERY ACUTE
TRULY I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE
BEEN BORN THEY SHOULD HAVE SMOTHERED ME AT THE FIRST CRY
HERE SHIRLEY STEPPING ASIDE TO GATHER A DEWY FLOWER SHE AND HER
COMPANION TURNED INTO A PATH THAT LAY NEARER THE GATE
SOME OF THEIR
CONVERSATION BECAME AUDIBLE
CAROLINE WOULD NOT STAY TO LISTEN
SHE
PASSED AWAY NOISELESSLY AND THE MOONLIGHT KISSED THE WALL WHICH HER
SHADOW HAD DIMMED
THE READER IS PRIVILEGED TO REMAIN AND TRY WHAT HE
CAN MAKE OF THE DISCOURSE
I CANNOT CONCEIVE WHY NATURE DID NOT GIVE YOU A BULLDOG'S HEAD FOR YOU
HAVE ALL A BULLDOG'S TENACITY SAID SHIRLEY
NOT A FLATTERING IDEA
AM I SO IGNOBLE
AND SOMETHING ALSO YOU HAVE OF THE SAME ANIMAL'S SILENT WAYS OF GOING
ABOUT ITS WORK
YOU GIVE NO WARNING YOU COME NOISELESSLY BEHIND SEIZE
FAST AND HOLD ON
THIS IS GUESS WORK
YOU HAVE WITNESSED NO SUCH FEAT ON MY PART
IN YOUR
PRESENCE I HAVE BEEN NO BULLDOG
YOUR VERY SILENCE INDICATES YOUR RACE
HOW LITTLE YOU TALK IN GENERAL
YET HOW DEEPLY YOU SCHEME YOU ARE FAR SEEING YOU ARE CALCULATING
I KNOW THE WAYS OF THESE PEOPLE
I HAVE GATHERED INFORMATION OF THEIR
INTENTIONS
MY NOTE LAST NIGHT INFORMED YOU THAT BARRACLOUGH'S TRIAL HAD
ENDED IN HIS CONVICTION AND SENTENCE TO TRANSPORTATION
HIS ASSOCIATES
WILL PLOT VENGEANCE
I SHALL LAY MY PLANS SO AS TO COUNTERACT OR AT
LEAST BE PREPARED FOR THEIRS THAT IS ALL
HAVING NOW GIVEN YOU AS CLEAR
AN EXPLANATION AS I CAN AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT FOR WHAT I PROPOSE
DOING I HAVE YOUR APPROBATION
I SHALL STAND BY YOU SO LONG AS YOU REMAIN ON THE DEFENSIVE
YES
GOOD WITHOUT ANY AID EVEN OPPOSED OR DISAPPROVED BY YOU I BELIEVE I
SHOULD HAVE ACTED PRECISELY AS I NOW INTEND TO ACT BUT IN ANOTHER
SPIRIT
I NOW FEEL SATISFIED
ON THE WHOLE I RELISH THE POSITION
I DARE SAY YOU DO
THAT IS EVIDENT
YOU RELISH THE WORK WHICH LIES
BEFORE YOU STILL BETTER THAN YOU WOULD RELISH THE EXECUTION OF A
GOVERNMENT ORDER FOR ARMY CLOTH
I CERTAINLY FEEL IT CONGENIAL
SO WOULD OLD HELSTONE
IT IS TRUE THERE IS A SHADE OF DIFFERENCE IN
YOUR MOTIVES MANY SHADES PERHAPS
SHALL I SPEAK TO MR
HELSTONE I
WILL IF YOU LIKE
ACT AS YOU PLEASE
YOUR JUDGMENT MISS KEELDAR WILL GUIDE YOU
ACCURATELY
I COULD RELY ON IT MYSELF IN A MORE DIFFICULT CRISIS
BUT I
SHOULD INFORM YOU MR
HELSTONE IS SOMEWHAT PREJUDICED AGAINST ME AT
PRESENT
I AM AWARE I HAVE HEARD ALL ABOUT YOUR DIFFERENCES
DEPEND UPON IT
THEY WILL MELT AWAY
HE CANNOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF AN ALLIANCE
UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE HIM HE IS OF TRUE METAL
I THINK SO ALSO
AN OLD BLADE AND RUSTY SOMEWHAT BUT THE EDGE AND TEMPER STILL
EXCELLENT
WELL YOU SHALL HAVE HIM MR
MOORE THAT IS IF I CAN WIN HIM
WHOM CAN YOU NOT WIN
PERHAPS NOT THE RECTOR BUT I WILL MAKE THE EFFORT
EFFORT HE WILL YIELD FOR A WORD A SMILE
BY NO MEANS
IT WILL COST ME SEVERAL CUPS OF TEA SOME TOAST AND CAKE
AND AN AMPLE MEASURE OF REMONSTRANCES EXPOSTULATIONS AND PERSUASIONS
IT GROWS RATHER CHILL
I PERCEIVE YOU SHIVER
AM I ACTING WRONGLY TO DETAIN YOU HERE YET IT
IS SO CALM I EVEN FEEL IT WARM AND SOCIETY SUCH AS YOURS IS A PLEASURE
TO ME SO RARE
IF YOU WERE WRAPPED IN A THICKER SHAWL
I MIGHT STAY LONGER AND FORGET HOW LATE IT IS WHICH WOULD CHAGRIN
MRS
PRYOR
WE KEEP EARLY AND REGULAR HOURS AT FIELDHEAD MR
MOORE AND
SO I AM SURE DOES YOUR SISTER AT THE COTTAGE
YES BUT HORTENSE AND I HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THE MOST CONVENIENT IN
THE WORLD THAT WE SHALL EACH DO AS WE PLEASE
HOW DO YOU PLEASE TO DO
THREE NIGHTS IN THE WEEK I SLEEP IN THE MILL BUT I REQUIRE LITTLE
REST AND WHEN IT IS MOONLIGHT AND MILD I OFTEN HAUNT THE HOLLOW TILL
DAYBREAK
WHEN I WAS A VERY LITTLE GIRL MR
MOORE MY NURSE USED TO TELL ME
TALES OF FAIRIES BEING SEEN IN THAT HOLLOW
THAT WAS BEFORE MY FATHER
BUILT THE MILL WHEN IT WAS A PERFECTLY SOLITARY RAVINE
YOU WILL BE
FALLING UNDER ENCHANTMENT
I FEAR IT IS DONE SAID MOORE IN A LOW VOICE
BUT THERE ARE WORSE THINGS THAN FAIRIES TO BE GUARDED AGAINST PURSUED
MISS KEELDAR
THINGS MORE PERILOUS HE SUBJOINED
FAR MORE SO
FOR INSTANCE HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET MICHAEL HARTLEY
THAT MAD CALVINIST AND JACOBIN WEAVER THEY SAY HE IS ADDICTED TO
POACHING AND OFTEN GOES ABROAD AT NIGHT WITH HIS GUN
I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE LUCK TO MEET HIM
WE HELD A LONG ARGUMENT
TOGETHER ONE NIGHT
A STRANGE LITTLE INCIDENT IT WAS I LIKED IT
LIKED IT I ADMIRE YOUR TASTE MICHAEL IS NOT SANE
WHERE DID YOU MEET
HIM
IN THE DEEPEST SHADIEST SPOT IN THE GLEN WHERE THE WATER RUNS LOW
UNDER BRUSHWOOD
WE SAT DOWN NEAR THAT PLANK BRIDGE
IT WAS MOONLIGHT
BUT CLOUDED AND VERY WINDY
WE HAD A TALK
ON POLITICS
AND RELIGION
I THINK THE MOON WAS AT THE FULL AND MICHAEL WAS AS NEAR
CRAZED AS POSSIBLE
HE UTTERED STRANGE BLASPHEMY IN HIS ANTINOMIAN
FASHION
EXCUSE ME BUT I THINK YOU MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY AS MAD AS HE TO SIT
LISTENING TO HIM
THERE IS A WILD INTEREST IN HIS RAVINGS
THE MAN WOULD BE HALF A POET
IF HE WERE NOT WHOLLY A MANIAC AND PERHAPS A PROPHET IF HE WERE NOT A
PROFLIGATE
HE SOLEMNLY INFORMED ME THAT HELL WAS FOREORDAINED MY
INEVITABLE PORTION THAT HE READ THE MARK OF THE BEAST ON MY BROW THAT
I HAD BEEN AN OUTCAST FROM THE BEGINNING
GOD'S VENGEANCE HE SAID WAS
PREPARING FOR ME AND AFFIRMED THAT IN A VISION OF THE NIGHT HE HAD
BEHELD THE MANNER AND THE INSTRUMENT OF MY DOOM
I WANTED TO KNOW
FURTHER BUT HE LEFT ME WITH THESE WORDS 'THE END IS NOT YET
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIM SINCE
ABOUT A MONTH AFTERWARDS IN RETURNING FROM MARKET I ENCOUNTERED HIM
AND MOSES BARRACLOUGH BOTH IN AN ADVANCED STAGE OF INEBRIATION
THEY
WERE PRAYING IN FRANTIC SORT AT THE ROADSIDE
THEY ACCOSTED ME AS SATAN
BID ME AVAUNT AND CLAMOURED TO BE DELIVERED FROM TEMPTATION
AGAIN BUT
A FEW DAYS AGO MICHAEL TOOK THE TROUBLE OF APPEARING AT THE
COUNTING HOUSE DOOR HATLESS IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES HIS COAT AND CASTOR
HAVING BEEN DETAINED AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE IN PLEDGE
HE DELIVERED HIMSELF
OF THE COMFORTABLE MESSAGE THAT HE COULD WISH MR
MOORE TO SET HIS HOUSE
IN ORDER AS HIS SOUL WAS LIKELY SHORTLY TO BE REQUIRED OF HIM
DO YOU MAKE LIGHT OF THESE THINGS
THE POOR MAN HAD BEEN DRINKING FOR WEEKS AND WAS IN A STATE BORDERING
ON DELIRIUM TREMENS
WHAT THEN HE IS THE MORE LIKELY TO ATTEMPT THE FULFILMENT OF HIS OWN
PROPHECIES
IT WOULD NOT DO TO PERMIT INCIDENTS OF THIS SORT TO AFFECT ONE'S
NERVES
MR
MOORE GO HOME
SO SOON
PASS STRAIGHT DOWN THE FIELDS NOT ROUND BY THE LADE AND PLANTATIONS
IT IS EARLY YET
IT IS LATE
FOR MY PART I AM GOING IN
WILL YOU PROMISE ME NOT TO
WANDER IN THE HOLLOW TO NIGHT
IF YOU WISH IT
I DO WISH IT
MAY I ASK WHETHER YOU CONSIDER LIFE VALUELESS
BY NO MEANS
ON THE CONTRARY OF LATE I REGARD MY LIFE AS INVALUABLE
OF LATE
EXISTENCE IS NEITHER AIMLESS NOR HOPELESS TO ME NOW AND IT WAS BOTH
THREE MONTHS AGO
I WAS THEN DROWNING AND RATHER WISHED THE OPERATION
OVER
ALL AT ONCE A HAND WAS STRETCHED TO ME SUCH A DELICATE HAND I
SCARCELY DARED TRUST IT ITS STRENGTH HOWEVER HAS RESCUED ME FROM
RUIN
ARE YOU REALLY RESCUED
FOR THE TIME
YOUR ASSISTANCE HAS GIVEN ME ANOTHER CHANCE
LIVE TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT
DON'T OFFER YOURSELF AS A TARGET TO
MICHAEL HARTLEY AND GOOD NIGHT
MISS HELSTONE WAS UNDER A PROMISE TO SPEND THE EVENING OF THE NEXT DAY
AT FIELDHEAD
SHE KEPT HER PROMISE
SOME GLOOMY HOURS HAD SHE SPENT IN
THE INTERVAL
MOST OF THE TIME HAD BEEN PASSED SHUT UP IN HER OWN
APARTMENT ONLY ISSUING FROM IT INDEED TO JOIN HER UNCLE AT MEALS AND
ANTICIPATING INQUIRIES FROM FANNY BY TELLING HER THAT SHE WAS BUSY
ALTERING A DRESS AND PREFERRED SEWING UPSTAIRS TO AVOID INTERRUPTION
SHE DID SEW
SHE PLIED HER NEEDLE CONTINUOUSLY CEASELESSLY BUT HER
BRAIN WORKED FASTER THAN HER FINGERS
AGAIN AND MORE INTENSELY THAN
EVER SHE DESIRED A FIXED OCCUPATION NO MATTER HOW ONEROUS HOW
IRKSOME
HER UNCLE MUST BE ONCE MORE ENTREATED BUT FIRST SHE WOULD
CONSULT MRS
PRYOR
HER HEAD LABOURED TO FRAME PROJECTS AS DILIGENTLY AS
HER HANDS TO PLAIT AND STITCH THE THIN TEXTURE OF THE MUSLIN SUMMER
DRESS SPREAD ON THE LITTLE WHITE COUCH AT THE FOOT OF WHICH SHE SAT
NOW
AND THEN WHILE THUS DOUBLY OCCUPIED A TEAR WOULD FILL HER EYES AND
FALL ON HER BUSY HANDS BUT THIS SIGN OF EMOTION WAS RARE AND QUICKLY
EFFACED
THE SHARP PANG PASSED THE DIMNESS CLEARED FROM HER VISION
SHE
WOULD RE THREAD HER NEEDLE REARRANGE TUCK AND TRIMMING AND WORK ON
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON SHE DRESSED HERSELF
SHE REACHED FIELDHEAD AND
APPEARED IN THE OAK PARLOUR JUST AS TEA WAS BROUGHT IN
SHIRLEY ASKED
HER WHY SHE CAME SO LATE
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN MAKING MY DRESS SAID SHE
THESE FINE SUNNY DAYS
BEGAN TO MAKE ME ASHAMED OF MY WINTER MERINO SO I HAVE FURBISHED UP A
LIGHTER GARMENT
IN WHICH YOU LOOK AS I LIKE TO SEE YOU SAID SHIRLEY
YOU ARE A
LADY LIKE LITTLE PERSON CAROLINE IS SHE NOT MRS
PRYOR
MRS
PRYOR NEVER PAID COMPLIMENTS AND SELDOM INDULGED IN REMARKS
FAVOURABLE OR OTHERWISE ON PERSONAL APPEARANCE
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION
SHE ONLY SWEPT CAROLINE'S CURLS FROM HER CHEEK AS SHE TOOK A SEAT NEAR
HER CARESSED THE OVAL OUTLINE AND OBSERVED YOU GET SOMEWHAT THIN MY
LOVE AND SOMEWHAT PALE
DO YOU SLEEP WELL YOUR EYES HAVE A LANGUID
LOOK AND SHE GAZED AT HER ANXIOUSLY
I SOMETIMES DREAM MELANCHOLY DREAMS ANSWERED CAROLINE AND IF I LIE
AWAKE FOR AN HOUR OR TWO IN THE NIGHT I AM CONTINUALLY THINKING OF THE
RECTORY AS A DREARY OLD PLACE
YOU KNOW IT IS VERY NEAR THE CHURCHYARD
THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE IS EXTREMELY ANCIENT AND IT IS SAID THAT THE
OUT KITCHENS THERE WERE ONCE ENCLOSED IN THE CHURCHYARD AND THAT THERE
ARE GRAVES UNDER THEM
I RATHER LONG TO LEAVE THE RECTORY
MY DEAR YOU ARE SURELY NOT SUPERSTITIOUS
NO MRS
PRYOR BUT I THINK I GROW WHAT IS CALLED NERVOUS
I SEE THINGS
UNDER A DARKER ASPECT THAN I USED TO DO
I HAVE FEARS I NEVER USED TO
HAVE NOT OF GHOSTS BUT OF OMENS AND DISASTROUS EVENTS AND I HAVE AN
INEXPRESSIBLE WEIGHT ON MY MIND WHICH I WOULD GIVE THE WORLD TO SHAKE
OFF AND I CANNOT DO IT
STRANGE CRIED SHIRLEY
I NEVER FEEL SO MRS
PRYOR SAID NOTHING
FINE WEATHER PLEASANT DAYS PLEASANT SCENES ARE POWERLESS TO GIVE ME
PLEASURE CONTINUED CAROLINE
CALM EVENINGS ARE NOT CALM TO ME
MOONLIGHT WHICH I USED TO THINK MILD NOW ONLY LOOKS MOURNFUL
IS THIS
WEAKNESS OF MIND MRS
PRYOR OR WHAT IS IT I CANNOT HELP IT
I OFTEN
STRUGGLE AGAINST IT
I REASON BUT REASON AND EFFORT MAKE NO
DIFFERENCE
YOU SHOULD TAKE MORE EXERCISE SAID MRS
PRYOR
EXERCISE I EXERCISE SUFFICIENTLY
I EXERCISE TILL I AM READY TO DROP
MY DEAR YOU SHOULD GO FROM HOME
MRS
PRYOR I SHOULD LIKE TO GO FROM HOME BUT NOT ON ANY PURPOSELESS
EXCURSION OR VISIT
I WISH TO BE A GOVERNESS AS YOU HAVE BEEN
IT WOULD
OBLIGE ME GREATLY IF YOU WOULD SPEAK TO MY UNCLE ON THE SUBJECT
NONSENSE BROKE IN SHIRLEY
WHAT AN IDEA BE A GOVERNESS BETTER BE A
SLAVE AT ONCE
WHERE IS THE NECESSITY OF IT WHY SHOULD YOU DREAM OF
SUCH A PAINFUL STEP
MY DEAR SAID MRS
PRYOR YOU ARE VERY YOUNG TO BE A GOVERNESS AND
NOT SUFFICIENTLY ROBUST
THE DUTIES A GOVERNESS UNDERTAKES ARE OFTEN
SEVERE
AND I BELIEVE I WANT SEVERE DUTIES TO OCCUPY ME
OCCUPY YOU CRIED SHIRLEY
WHEN ARE YOU IDLE I NEVER SAW A MORE
INDUSTRIOUS GIRL THAN YOU
YOU ARE ALWAYS AT WORK
COME SHE
CONTINUED COME AND SIT BY MY SIDE AND TAKE SOME TEA TO REFRESH YOU
YOU DON'T CARE MUCH FOR MY FRIENDSHIP THEN THAT YOU WISH TO LEAVE ME
INDEED I DO SHIRLEY AND I DON'T WISH TO LEAVE YOU
I SHALL NEVER FIND
ANOTHER FRIEND SO DEAR
AT WHICH WORDS MISS KEELDAR PUT HER HAND INTO CAROLINE'S WITH AN
IMPULSIVELY AFFECTIONATE MOVEMENT WHICH WAS WELL SECONDED BY THE
EXPRESSION OF HER FACE
IF YOU THINK SO YOU HAD BETTER MAKE MUCH OF ME SHE SAID AND NOT
RUN AWAY FROM ME
I HATE TO PART WITH THOSE TO WHOM I AM BECOME
ATTACHED
MRS
PRYOR THERE SOMETIMES TALKS OF LEAVING ME AND SAYS I
MIGHT MAKE A MORE ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION THAN HERSELF
I SHOULD AS SOON
THINK OF EXCHANGING AN OLD FASHIONED MOTHER FOR SOMETHING MODISH AND
STYLISH
AS FOR YOU WHY I BEGAN TO FLATTER MYSELF WE WERE THOROUGHLY
FRIENDS THAT YOU LIKED SHIRLEY ALMOST AS WELL AS SHIRLEY LIKES YOU AND
SHE DOES NOT STINT HER REGARD
I DO LIKE SHIRLEY
I LIKE HER MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY
BUT THAT DOES
NOT MAKE ME STRONG OR HAPPY
AND WOULD IT MAKE YOU STRONG OR HAPPY TO GO AND LIVE AS A DEPENDENT
AMONGST UTTER STRANGERS IT WOULD NOT
AND THE EXPERIMENT MUST NOT BE
TRIED I TELL YOU IT WOULD FAIL
IT IS NOT IN YOUR NATURE TO BEAR THE
DESOLATE LIFE GOVERNESSES GENERALLY LEAD YOU WOULD FALL ILL
I WON'T
HEAR OF IT
AND MISS KEELDAR PAUSED HAVING UTTERED THIS PROHIBITION VERY DECIDEDLY
SOON SHE RECOMMENCED STILL LOOKING SOMEWHAT COURROUCE WHY IT IS
MY DAILY PLEASURE NOW TO LOOK OUT FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE BONNET AND THE
SILK SCARF GLANCING THROUGH THE TREES IN THE LANE AND TO KNOW THAT MY
QUIET SHREWD THOUGHTFUL COMPANION AND MONITRESS IS COMING BACK TO ME
THAT I SHALL HAVE HER SITTING IN THE ROOM TO LOOK AT TO TALK TO OR TO
LET ALONE AS SHE AND I PLEASE
THIS MAY BE A SELFISH SORT OF
LANGUAGE I KNOW IT IS BUT IT IS THE LANGUAGE WHICH NATURALLY RISES TO
MY LIPS THEREFORE I UTTER IT
I WOULD WRITE TO YOU SHIRLEY
AND WHAT ARE LETTERS ONLY A SORT OF PIS ALLER
DRINK SOME TEA
CAROLINE
EAT SOMETHING YOU EAT NOTHING
LAUGH AND BE CHEERFUL AND
STAY AT HOME
MISS HELSTONE SHOOK HER HEAD AND SIGHED
SHE FELT WHAT DIFFICULTY SHE
WOULD HAVE TO PERSUADE ANY ONE TO ASSIST OR SANCTION HER IN MAKING THAT
CHANGE IN HER LIFE WHICH SHE BELIEVED DESIRABLE
MIGHT SHE ONLY FOLLOW
HER OWN JUDGMENT SHE THOUGHT SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND PERHAPS A HARSH
BUT AN EFFECTUAL CURE FOR HER SUFFERINGS
BUT THIS JUDGMENT FOUNDED ON
CIRCUMSTANCES SHE COULD FULLY EXPLAIN TO NONE LEAST OF ALL TO SHIRLEY
SEEMED IN ALL EYES BUT HER OWN INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND FANTASTIC AND
WAS OPPOSED ACCORDINGLY
THERE REALLY WAS NO PRESENT PECUNIARY NEED FOR HER TO LEAVE A
COMFORTABLE HOME AND TAKE A SITUATION AND THERE WAS EVERY PROBABILITY
THAT HER UNCLE MIGHT IN SOME WAY PERMANENTLY PROVIDE FOR HER
SO HER
FRIENDS THOUGHT AND AS FAR AS THEIR LIGHTS ENABLED THEM TO SEE THEY
REASONED CORRECTLY BUT OF CAROLINE'S STRANGE SUFFERINGS WHICH SHE
DESIRED SO EAGERLY TO OVERCOME OR ESCAPE THEY HAD NO IDEA OF HER
RACKED NIGHTS AND DISMAL DAYS NO SUSPICION
IT WAS AT ONCE IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOPELESS TO EXPLAIN TO WAIT AND ENDURE WAS HER ONLY PLAN
MANY THAT
WANT FOOD AND CLOTHING HAVE CHEERIER LIVES AND BRIGHTER PROSPECTS THAN
SHE HAD MANY HARASSED BY POVERTY ARE IN A STRAIT LESS AFFLICTIVE
NOW IS YOUR MIND QUIETED INQUIRED SHIRLEY
WILL YOU CONSENT TO STAY
AT HOME
I SHALL NOT LEAVE IT AGAINST THE APPROBATION OF MY FRIENDS WAS THE
REPLY BUT I THINK IN TIME THEY WILL BE OBLIGED TO THINK AS I DO
DURING THIS CONVERSATION MRS
PRYOR LOOKED FAR FROM EASY
HER EXTREME
HABITUAL RESERVE WOULD RARELY PERMIT HER TO TALK FREELY OR TO
INTERROGATE OTHERS CLOSELY
SHE COULD THINK A MULTITUDE OF QUESTIONS SHE
NEVER VENTURED TO PUT GIVE ADVICE IN HER MIND WHICH HER TONGUE NEVER
DELIVERED
HAD SHE BEEN ALONE WITH CAROLINE SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE
SAID SOMETHING TO THE POINT MISS KEELDAR'S PRESENCE ACCUSTOMED AS SHE
WAS TO IT SEALED HER LIPS
NOW AS ON A THOUSAND OTHER OCCASIONS
INEXPLICABLE NERVOUS SCRUPLES KEPT HER BACK FROM INTERFERING
SHE MERELY
SHOWED HER CONCERN FOR MISS HELSTONE IN AN INDIRECT WAY BY ASKING HER
IF THE FIRE MADE HER TOO WARM PLACING A SCREEN BETWEEN HER CHAIR AND
THE HEARTH CLOSING A WINDOW WHENCE SHE IMAGINED A DRAUGHT PROCEEDED
AND OFTEN AND RESTLESSLY GLANCING AT HER
SHIRLEY RESUMED HAVING
DESTROYED YOUR PLAN SHE SAID WHICH I HOPE I HAVE DONE I SHALL
CONSTRUCT A NEW ONE OF MY OWN
EVERY SUMMER I MAKE AN EXCURSION
THIS
SEASON I PROPOSE SPENDING TWO MONTHS EITHER AT THE SCOTCH LOCHS OR THE
ENGLISH LAKES THAT IS I SHALL GO THERE PROVIDED YOU CONSENT TO
ACCOMPANY ME
IF YOU REFUSE I SHALL NOT STIR A FOOT
YOU ARE VERY GOOD SHIRLEY
I WOULD BE VERY GOOD IF YOU WOULD LET ME
I HAVE EVERY DISPOSITION TO
BE GOOD
IT IS MY MISFORTUNE AND HABIT I KNOW TO THINK OF MYSELF
PARAMOUNT TO ANYBODY ELSE BUT WHO IS NOT LIKE ME IN THAT RESPECT
HOWEVER WHEN CAPTAIN KEELDAR IS MADE COMFORTABLE ACCOMMODATED WITH ALL
HE WANTS INCLUDING A SENSIBLE GENIAL COMRADE IT GIVES HIM A THOROUGH
PLEASURE TO DEVOTE HIS SPARE EFFORTS TO MAKING THAT COMRADE HAPPY
AND
SHOULD WE NOT BE HAPPY CAROLINE IN THE HIGHLANDS WE WILL GO TO THE
HIGHLANDS
WE WILL IF YOU CAN BEAR A SEA VOYAGE GO TO THE ISLES THE
HEBRIDES THE SHETLAND THE ORKNEY ISLANDS
WOULD YOU NOT LIKE THAT I
SEE YOU WOULD MRS
PRYOR I CALL YOU TO WITNESS
HER FACE IS ALL
SUNSHINE AT THE BARE MENTION OF IT
I SHOULD LIKE IT MUCH RETURNED CAROLINE TO WHOM INDEED THE NOTION
OF SUCH A TOUR WAS NOT ONLY PLEASANT BUT GLORIOUSLY REVIVING
SHIRLEY
RUBBED HER HANDS
COME I CAN BESTOW A BENEFIT SHE EXCLAIMED
I CAN DO A GOOD DEED
WITH MY CASH
MY THOUSAND A YEAR IS NOT MERELY A MATTER OF DIRTY
BANK NOTES AND JAUNDICED GUINEAS LET ME SPEAK RESPECTFULLY OF BOTH
THOUGH FOR I ADORE THEM BUT IT MAY BE HEALTH TO THE DROOPING
STRENGTH TO THE WEAK CONSOLATION TO THE SAD
I WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE
SOMETHING OF IT BETTER THAN A FINE OLD HOUSE TO LIVE IN THAN SATIN
GOWNS TO WEAR BETTER THAN DEFERENCE FROM ACQUAINTANCE AND HOMAGE FROM
THE POOR
HERE IS TO BEGIN
THIS SUMMER CAROLINE MRS
PRYOR AND I GO
OUT INTO THE NORTH ATLANTIC BEYOND THE SHETLAND PERHAPS TO THE FAROE
ISLES
WE WILL SEE SEALS IN SUDEROE AND DOUBTLESS MERMAIDS IN
STROMOE CAROLINE IS LAUGHING MRS
PRYOR
I MADE HER LAUGH I HAVE
DONE HER GOOD
I SHALL LIKE TO GO SHIRLEY AGAIN SAID MISS HELSTONE
I LONG TO HEAR
THE SOUND OF WAVES OCEAN WAVES AND TO SEE THEM AS I HAVE IMAGINED THEM
IN DREAMS LIKE TOSSING BANKS OF GREEN LIGHT STREWED WITH VANISHING AND
REAPPEARING WREATHS OF FOAM WHITER THAN LILIES
I SHALL DELIGHT TO PASS
THE SHORES OF THOSE LONE ROCK ISLETS WHERE THE SEA BIRDS LIVE AND BREED
UNMOLESTED
WE SHALL BE ON THE TRACK OF THE OLD SCANDINAVIANS OF THE
NORSEMEN
WE SHALL ALMOST SEE THE SHORES OF NORWAY
THIS IS A VERY VAGUE
DELIGHT THAT I FEEL COMMUNICATED BY YOUR PROPOSAL BUT IT IS A
DELIGHT
WILL YOU THINK OF FITFUL HEAD NOW WHEN YOU LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT OF GULLS
SHRIEKING ROUND IT AND WAVES TUMBLING IN UPON IT RATHER THAN OF THE
GRAVES UNDER THE RECTORY BACK KITCHEN
I WILL TRY AND INSTEAD OF MUSING ABOUT REMNANTS OF SHROUDS AND
FRAGMENTS OF COFFINS AND HUMAN BONES AND MOULD I WILL FANCY SEALS
LYING IN THE SUNSHINE ON SOLITARY SHORES WHERE NEITHER FISHERMAN NOR
HUNTER EVER COME OF ROCK CREVICES FULL OF PEARLY EGGS BEDDED IN
SEAWEED OF UNSCARED BIRDS COVERING WHITE SANDS IN HAPPY FLOCKS
AND WHAT WILL BECOME OF THAT INEXPRESSIBLE WEIGHT YOU SAID YOU HAD ON
YOUR MIND
I WILL TRY TO FORGET IT IN SPECULATION ON THE SWAY OF THE WHOLE GREAT
DEEP ABOVE A HERD OF WHALES RUSHING THROUGH THE LIVID AND LIQUID THUNDER
DOWN FROM THE FROZEN ZONE A HUNDRED OF THEM PERHAPS WALLOWING
FLASHING ROLLING IN THE WAKE OF A PATRIARCH BULL HUGE ENOUGH TO HAVE
BEEN SPAWNED BEFORE THE FLOOD SUCH A CREATURE AS POOR SMART HAD IN HIS
MIND WHEN HE SAID
'STRONG AGAINST TIDES THE ENORMOUS WHALE
EMERGES AS HE GOES
I HOPE OUR BARK WILL MEET WITH NO SUCH SHOAL OR HERD AS YOU TERM IT
CAROLINE
I SUPPOSE YOU FANCY THE SEA MAMMOTHS PASTURING ABOUT THE
BASES OF THE 'EVERLASTING HILLS DEVOURING STRANGE PROVENDER IN THE
VAST VALLEYS THROUGH AND ABOVE WHICH SEA BILLOWS ROLL I SHOULD NOT
LIKE TO BE CAPSIZED BY THE PATRIARCH BULL
I SUPPOSE YOU EXPECT TO SEE MERMAIDS SHIRLEY
ONE OF THEM AT ANY RATE I DO NOT BARGAIN FOR LESS AND SHE IS TO
APPEAR IN SOME SUCH FASHION AS THIS
I AM TO BE WALKING BY MYSELF ON
DECK RATHER LATE OF AN AUGUST EVENING WATCHING AND BEING WATCHED BY A
FULL HARVEST MOON
SOMETHING IS TO RISE WHITE ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
OVER WHICH THAT MOON MOUNTS SILENT AND HANGS GLORIOUS
THE OBJECT
GLITTERS AND SINKS
IT RISES AGAIN
I THINK I HEAR IT CRY WITH AN
ARTICULATE VOICE I CALL YOU UP FROM THE CABIN I SHOW YOU AN IMAGE
FAIR AS ALABASTER EMERGING FROM THE DIM WAVE
WE BOTH SEE THE LONG
HAIR THE LIFTED AND FOAM WHITE ARM THE OVAL MIRROR BRILLIANT AS A
STAR
IT GLIDES NEARER A HUMAN FACE IS PLAINLY VISIBLE A FACE IN THE
STYLE OF YOURS WHOSE STRAIGHT PURE EXCUSE THE WORD IT IS
APPROPRIATE WHOSE STRAIGHT PURE LINEAMENTS PALENESS DOES NOT
DISFIGURE
IT LOOKS AT US BUT NOT WITH YOUR EYES
I SEE A PRETERNATURAL
LURE IN ITS WILY GLANCE
IT BECKONS
WERE WE MEN WE SHOULD SPRING AT
THE SIGN THE COLD BILLOW WOULD BE DARED FOR THE SAKE OF THE COLDER
ENCHANTRESS BEING WOMEN WE STAND SAFE THOUGH NOT DREADLESS
SHE
COMPREHENDS OUR UNMOVED GAZE SHE FEELS HERSELF POWERLESS ANGER CROSSES
HER FRONT SHE CANNOT CHARM BUT SHE WILL APPAL US SHE RISES HIGH AND
GLIDES ALL REVEALED ON THE DARK WAVE RIDGE
TEMPTRESS TERROR MONSTROUS
LIKENESS OF OURSELVES ARE YOU NOT GLAD CAROLINE WHEN AT LAST AND
WITH A WILD SHRIEK SHE DIVES
BUT SHIRLEY SHE IS NOT LIKE US
WE ARE NEITHER TEMPTRESSES NOR
TERRORS NOR MONSTERS
SOME OF OUR KIND IT IS SAID ARE ALL THREE
THERE ARE MEN WHO ASCRIBE
TO 'WOMAN IN GENERAL SUCH ATTRIBUTES
MY DEARS HERE INTERRUPTED MRS
PRYOR DOES IT NOT STRIKE YOU THAT
YOUR CONVERSATION FOR THE LAST TEN MINUTES HAS BEEN RATHER FANCIFUL
BUT THERE IS NO HARM IN OUR FANCIES IS THERE MA'AM
WE ARE AWARE THAT MERMAIDS DO NOT EXIST WHY SPEAK OF THEM AS IF THEY
DID HOW CAN YOU FIND INTEREST IN SPEAKING OF A NONENTITY
I DON'T KNOW SAID SHIRLEY
MY DEAR I THINK THERE IS AN ARRIVAL
I HEARD A STEP IN THE LANE WHILE
YOU WERE TALKING AND IS NOT THAT THE GARDEN GATE WHICH CREAKS
SHIRLEY STEPPED TO THE WINDOW
YES THERE IS SOME ONE SAID SHE TURNING QUIETLY AWAY AND AS SHE
RESUMED HER SEAT A SENSITIVE FLUSH ANIMATED HER FACE WHILE A TREMBLING
RAY AT ONCE KINDLED AND SOFTENED HER EYE
SHE RAISED HER HAND TO HER
CHIN CAST HER GAZE DOWN AND SEEMED TO THINK AS SHE WAITED
THE SERVANT ANNOUNCED MR
MOORE AND SHIRLEY TURNED ROUND WHEN MR
MOORE
APPEARED AT THE DOOR
HIS FIGURE SEEMED VERY TALL AS HE ENTERED AND
STOOD IN CONTRAST WITH THE THREE LADIES NONE OF WHOM COULD BOAST A
STATURE MUCH BEYOND THE AVERAGE
HE WAS LOOKING WELL BETTER THAN HE HAD
BEEN KNOWN TO LOOK FOR THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS
A SORT OF RENEWED YOUTH
GLOWED IN HIS EYE AND COLOUR AND AN INVIGORATED HOPE AND SETTLED
PURPOSE SUSTAINED HIS BEARING
FIRMNESS HIS COUNTENANCE STILL INDICATED
BUT NOT AUSTERITY
IT LOOKED AS CHEERFUL AS IT WAS EARNEST
I AM JUST RETURNED FROM STILBRO' HE SAID TO MISS KEELDAR AS HE
GREETED HER AND I THOUGHT I WOULD CALL TO IMPART TO YOU THE RESULT OF
MY MISSION
YOU DID RIGHT NOT TO KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE SHE SAID AND YOUR VISIT IS
WELL TIMED
SIT DOWN
WE HAVE NOT FINISHED TEA
ARE YOU ENGLISH ENOUGH
TO RELISH TEA OR DO YOU FAITHFULLY ADHERE TO COFFEE
MOORE ACCEPTED TEA
I AM LEARNING TO BE A NATURALIZED ENGLISHMAN SAID HE MY FOREIGN
HABITS ARE LEAVING ME ONE BY ONE
AND NOW HE PAID HIS RESPECTS TO MRS
PRYOR AND PAID THEM WELL WITH A
GRAVE MODESTY THAT BECAME HIS AGE COMPARED WITH HERS
THEN HE LOOKED AT
CAROLINE NOT HOWEVER FOR THE FIRST TIME HIS GLANCE HAD FALLEN UPON
HER BEFORE
HE BENT TOWARDS HER AS SHE SAT GAVE HER HIS HAND AND ASKED
HER HOW SHE WAS
THE LIGHT FROM THE WINDOW DID NOT FALL UPON MISS
HELSTONE HER BACK WAS TURNED TOWARDS IT
A QUIET THOUGH RATHER LOW
REPLY A STILL DEMEANOUR AND THE FRIENDLY PROTECTION OF EARLY TWILIGHT
KEPT OUT OF VIEW EACH TRAITOROUS SYMPTOM
NONE COULD AFFIRM THAT SHE HAD
TREMBLED OR BLUSHED THAT HER HEART HAD QUAKED OR HER NERVES THRILLED
NONE COULD PROVE EMOTION A GREETING SHOWING LESS EFFUSION WAS NEVER
INTERCHANGED
MOORE TOOK THE EMPTY CHAIR NEAR HER OPPOSITE MISS
KEELDAR
HE HAD PLACED HIMSELF WELL
HIS NEIGHBOUR SCREENED BY THE VERY
CLOSENESS OF HIS VICINAGE FROM HIS SCRUTINY AND SHELTERED FURTHER BY
THE DUSK WHICH DEEPENED EACH MOMENT SOON REGAINED NOT MERELY SEEMING
BUT REAL MASTERY OF THE FEELINGS WHICH HAD STARTED INTO INSURRECTION
AT THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS NAME
HE ADDRESSED HIS CONVERSATION TO MISS KEELDAR
I WENT TO THE BARRACKS HE SAID AND HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH COLONEL
RYDE
HE APPROVED MY PLANS AND PROMISED THE AID I WANTED
INDEED HE
OFFERED A MORE NUMEROUS FORCE THAN I REQUIRE HALF A DOZEN WILL SUFFICE
I DON'T INTEND TO BE SWAMPED BY REDCOATS
THEY ARE NEEDED FOR APPEARANCE
RATHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
MY MAIN RELIANCE IS ON MY OWN CIVILIANS
AND ON THEIR CAPTAIN INTERPOSED SHIRLEY
WHAT CAPTAIN KEELDAR INQUIRED MOORE SLIGHTLY SMILING AND NOT
LIFTING HIS EYES
THE TONE OF RAILLERY IN WHICH HE SAID THIS WAS VERY
RESPECTFUL AND SUPPRESSED
NO RETURNED SHIRLEY ANSWERING THE SMILE CAPTAIN GRARD MOORE WHO
TRUSTS MUCH TO THE PROWESS OF HIS OWN RIGHT ARM I BELIEVE
FURNISHED WITH HIS COUNTING HOUSE RULER ADDED MOORE
RESUMING HIS
USUAL GRAVITY HE WENT ON I RECEIVED BY THIS EVENING'S POST A NOTE
FROM THE HOME SECRETARY IN ANSWER TO MINE
IT APPEARS THEY ARE UNEASY AT
THE STATE OF MATTERS HERE IN THE NORTH THEY ESPECIALLY CONDEMN THE
SUPINENESS AND PUSILLANIMITY OF THE MILL OWNERS
THEY SAY AS I HAVE
ALWAYS SAID THAT INACTION UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES IS CRIMINAL
AND THAT COWARDICE IS CRUELTY SINCE BOTH CAN ONLY ENCOURAGE DISORDER
AND LEAD FINALLY TO SANGUINARY OUTBREAKS
THERE IS THE NOTE I BROUGHT
IT FOR YOUR PERUSAL AND THERE IS A BATCH OF NEWSPAPERS CONTAINING
FURTHER ACCOUNTS OF PROCEEDINGS IN NOTTINGHAM MANCHESTER AND
ELSEWHERE
HE PRODUCED LETTERS AND JOURNALS AND LAID THEM BEFORE MISS KEELDAR
WHILE SHE PERUSED THEM HE TOOK HIS TEA QUIETLY BUT THOUGH HIS TONGUE
WAS STILL HIS OBSERVANT FACULTIES SEEMED BY NO MEANS OFF DUTY
MRS
PRYOR SITTING IN THE BACKGROUND DID NOT COME WITHIN THE RANGE OF HIS
GLANCE BUT THE TWO YOUNGER LADIES HAD THE FULL BENEFIT THEREOF
MISS KEELDAR PLACED DIRECTLY OPPOSITE WAS SEEN WITHOUT EFFORT
SHE WAS
THE OBJECT HIS EYES WHEN LIFTED NATURALLY MET FIRST AND AS WHAT
REMAINED OF DAYLIGHT THE GILDING OF THE WEST WAS UPON HER HER SHAPE
ROSE IN RELIEF FROM THE DARK PANELLING BEHIND
SHIRLEY'S CLEAR CHEEK WAS
TINTED YET WITH THE COLOUR WHICH HAD RISEN INTO IT A FEW MINUTES SINCE
THE DARK LASHES OF HER EYES LOOKING DOWN AS SHE READ THE DUSK YET
DELICATE LINE OF HER EYEBROWS THE ALMOST SABLE GLOSS OF HER CURLS MADE
HER HEIGHTENED COMPLEXION LOOK FINE AS THE BLOOM OF A RED WILD FLOWER BY
CONTRAST
THERE WAS NATURAL GRACE IN HER ATTITUDE AND THERE WAS
ARTISTIC EFFECT IN THE AMPLE AND SHINING FOLDS OF HER SILK DRESS AN
ATTIRE SIMPLY FASHIONED BUT ALMOST SPLENDID FROM THE SHIFTING
BRIGHTNESS OF ITS DYE WARP AND WOOF BEING OF TINTS DEEP AND CHANGING AS
THE HUE ON A PHEASANT'S NECK
A GLANCING BRACELET ON HER ARM PRODUCED
THE CONTRAST OF GOLD AND IVORY
THERE WAS SOMETHING BRILLIANT IN THE
WHOLE PICTURE
IT IS TO BE SUPPOSED THAT MOORE THOUGHT SO AS HIS EYE
DWELT LONG ON IT BUT HE SELDOM PERMITTED HIS FEELINGS OR HIS OPINIONS
TO EXHIBIT THEMSELVES IN HIS FACE
HIS TEMPERAMENT BOASTED A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF PHLEGM AND HE PREFERRED AN UNDEMONSTRATIVE NOT UNGENTLE BUT
SERIOUS ASPECT TO ANY OTHER
HE COULD NOT BY LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM SEE CAROLINE AS SHE WAS
CLOSE AT HIS SIDE
IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE TO MANUVRE A LITTLE TO
GET HER WELL WITHIN THE RANGE OF HIS OBSERVATION
HE LEANED BACK IN HIS
CHAIR AND LOOKED DOWN ON HER
IN MISS HELSTONE NEITHER HE NOR ANY ONE
ELSE COULD DISCOVER BRILLIANCY
SITTING IN THE SHADE WITHOUT FLOWERS
OR ORNAMENTS HER ATTIRE THE MODEST MUSLIN DRESS COLOURLESS BUT FOR ITS
NARROW STRIPE OF PALE AZURE HER COMPLEXION UNFLUSHED UNEXCITED THE
VERY BROWNNESS OF HER HAIR AND EYES INVISIBLE BY THIS FAINT LIGHT SHE
WAS COMPARED WITH THE HEIRESS AS A GRACEFUL PENCIL SKETCH COMPARED
WITH A VIVID PAINTING
SINCE ROBERT HAD SEEN HER LAST A GREAT CHANGE HAD
BEEN WROUGHT IN HER
WHETHER HE PERCEIVED IT MIGHT NOT BE ASCERTAINED
HE SAID NOTHING TO THAT EFFECT
HOW IS HORTENSE ASKED CAROLINE SOFTLY
VERY WELL BUT SHE COMPLAINS OF BEING UNEMPLOYED
SHE MISSES YOU
TELL HER THAT I MISS HER AND THAT I WRITE AND READ A PORTION OF FRENCH
EVERY DAY
SHE WILL ASK IF YOU SENT YOUR LOVE SHE IS ALWAYS PARTICULAR ON THAT
POINT
YOU KNOW SHE LIKES ATTENTION
MY BEST LOVE MY VERY BEST
AND SAY TO HER THAT WHENEVER SHE HAS TIME
TO WRITE ME A LITTLE NOTE I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR FROM HER
WHAT IF I FORGET I AM NOT THE SUREST MESSENGER OF COMPLIMENTS
NO DON'T FORGET ROBERT
IT IS NO COMPLIMENT IT IS IN GOOD EARNEST
AND MUST THEREFORE BE DELIVERED PUNCTUALLY
IF YOU PLEASE
HORTENSE WILL BE READY TO SHED TEARS
SHE IS TENDERHEARTED ON THE
SUBJECT OF HER PUPIL YET SHE REPROACHES YOU SOMETIMES FOR OBEYING YOUR
UNCLE'S INJUNCTIONS TOO LITERALLY
AFFECTION LIKE LOVE WILL BE UNJUST
NOW AND THEN
AND CAROLINE MADE NO ANSWER TO THIS OBSERVATION FOR INDEED HER HEART
WAS TROUBLED AND TO HER EYES SHE WOULD HAVE RAISED HER HANDKERCHIEF IF
SHE HAD DARED
IF SHE HAD DARED TOO SHE WOULD HAVE DECLARED HOW THE
VERY FLOWERS IN THE GARDEN OF HOLLOW'S COTTAGE WERE DEAR TO HER HOW THE
LITTLE PARLOUR OF THAT HOUSE WAS HER EARTHLY PARADISE HOW SHE LONGED TO
RETURN TO IT AS MUCH ALMOST AS THE FIRST WOMAN IN HER EXILE MUST HAVE
LONGED TO REVISIT EDEN
NOT DARING HOWEVER TO SAY THESE THINGS SHE
HELD HER PEACE SHE SAT QUIET AT ROBERT'S SIDE WAITING FOR HIM TO SAY
SOMETHING MORE
IT WAS LONG SINCE THIS PROXIMITY HAD BEEN HERS LONG
SINCE HIS VOICE HAD ADDRESSED HER COULD SHE WITH ANY SHOW OF
PROBABILITY EVEN OF POSSIBILITY HAVE IMAGINED THAT THE MEETING GAVE
HIM PLEASURE TO HER IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN DEEP BLISS
YET EVEN IN DOUBT
THAT IT PLEASED IN DREAD THAT IT MIGHT ANNOY HIM SHE RECEIVED THE
BOON OF THE MEETING AS AN IMPRISONED BIRD WOULD THE ADMISSION OF
SUNSHINE TO ITS CAGE
IT WAS OF NO USE ARGUING CONTENDING AGAINST THE
SENSE OF PRESENT HAPPINESS TO BE NEAR ROBERT WAS TO BE REVIVED
MISS KEELDAR LAID DOWN THE PAPERS
AND ARE YOU GLAD OR SAD FOR ALL THESE MENACING TIDINGS SHE INQUIRED
OF HER TENANT
NOT PRECISELY EITHER BUT I CERTAINLY AM INSTRUCTED
I SEE THAT OUR
ONLY PLAN IS TO BE FIRM
I SEE THAT EFFICIENT PREPARATION AND A RESOLUTE
ATTITUDE ARE THE BEST MEANS OF AVERTING BLOODSHED
HE THEN INQUIRED IF SHE HAD OBSERVED SOME PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH TO WHICH
SHE REPLIED IN THE NEGATIVE AND HE ROSE TO SHOW IT TO HER
HE CONTINUED
THE CONVERSATION STANDING BEFORE HER
FROM THE TENOR OF WHAT HE SAID IT
APPEARED EVIDENT THAT THEY BOTH APPREHENDED DISTURBANCES IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BRIARFIELD THOUGH IN WHAT FORM THEY EXPECTED THEM TO
BREAK OUT WAS NOT SPECIFIED
NEITHER CAROLINE NOR MRS
PRYOR ASKED
QUESTIONS
THE SUBJECT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE REGARDED AS ONE RIPE FOR
FREE DISCUSSION THEREFORE THE LADY AND HER TENANT WERE SUFFERED TO KEEP
DETAILS TO THEMSELVES UNIMPORTUNED BY THE CURIOSITY OF THEIR LISTENERS
MISS KEELDAR IN SPEAKING TO MR
MOORE TOOK A TONE AT ONCE ANIMATED AND
DIGNIFIED CONFIDENTIAL AND SELF RESPECTING
WHEN HOWEVER THE CANDLES
WERE BROUGHT IN AND THE FIRE WAS STIRRED UP AND THE FULLNESS OF LIGHT
THUS PRODUCED RENDERED THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE LEGIBLE YOU
COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS ALL INTEREST LIFE AND EARNESTNESS
THERE WAS
NOTHING COQUETTISH IN HER DEMEANOUR WHATEVER SHE FELT FOR MOORE SHE
FELT IT SERIOUSLY
AND SERIOUS TOO WERE HIS FEELINGS AND SETTLED WERE
HIS VIEWS APPARENTLY FOR HE MADE NO PETTY EFFORT TO ATTRACT DAZZLE
OR IMPRESS
HE CONTRIVED NOTWITHSTANDING TO COMMAND A LITTLE BECAUSE
THE DEEPER VOICE HOWEVER MILDLY MODULATED THE SOMEWHAT HARDER MIND
NOW AND THEN THOUGH INVOLUNTARILY AND UNINTENTIONALLY BORE DOWN BY
SOME PEREMPTORY PHRASE OR TONE THE MELLOW ACCENTS AND SUSCEPTIBLE IF
HIGH NATURE OF SHIRLEY
MISS KEELDAR LOOKED HAPPY IN CONVERSING WITH
HIM AND HER JOY SEEMED TWOFOLD A JOY OF THE PAST AND PRESENT OF
MEMORY AND OF HOPE
WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID ARE CAROLINE'S IDEAS OF THE PAIR
SHE FELT WHAT
HAS JUST BEEN DESCRIBED
IN THUS FEELING SHE TRIED NOT TO SUFFER BUT
SUFFERED SHARPLY NEVERTHELESS
SHE SUFFERED INDEED MISERABLY
A FEW
MINUTES BEFORE HER FAMISHED HEART HAD TASTED A DROP AND CRUMB OF
NOURISHMENT THAT IF FREELY GIVEN WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BACK ABUNDANCE OF
LIFE WHERE LIFE WAS FAILING BUT THE GENEROUS FEAST WAS SNATCHED FROM
HER SPREAD BEFORE ANOTHER AND SHE REMAINED BUT A BYSTANDER AT THE
BANQUET
THE CLOCK STRUCK NINE IT WAS CAROLINE'S TIME FOR GOING HOME
SHE
GATHERED UP HER WORK PUT THE EMBROIDERY THE SCISSORS THE THIMBLE INTO
HER BAG
SHE BADE MRS
PRYOR A QUIET GOOD NIGHT RECEIVING FROM THAT
LADY A WARMER PRESSURE OF THE HAND THAN USUAL
SHE STEPPED UP TO MISS
KEELDAR
GOOD NIGHT SHIRLEY
SHIRLEY STARTED UP
WHAT SO SOON ARE YOU GOING ALREADY
IT IS PAST NINE
I NEVER HEARD THE CLOCK
YOU WILL COME AGAIN TO MORROW AND YOU WILL BE
HAPPY TO NIGHT WILL YOU NOT REMEMBER OUR PLANS
YES SAID CAROLINE I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN
HER MIND MISGAVE HER THAT NEITHER THOSE PLANS NOR ANY OTHER COULD
PERMANENTLY RESTORE HER MENTAL TRANQUILLITY
SHE TURNED TO ROBERT WHO
STOOD CLOSE BEHIND HER
AS HE LOOKED UP THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLES ON THE
MANTELPIECE FELL FULL ON HER FACE
ALL ITS PALENESS ALL ITS CHANGE ALL
ITS FORLORN MEANING WERE CLEARLY REVEALED
ROBERT HAD GOOD EYES AND
MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT IF HE WOULD WHETHER HE DID SEE IT NOTHING
INDICATED
GOOD NIGHT SHE SAID SHAKING LIKE A LEAF OFFERING HER THIN HAND
HASTILY ANXIOUS TO PART FROM HIM QUICKLY
YOU ARE GOING HOME HE ASKED NOT TOUCHING HER HAND
YES
IS FANNY COME FOR YOU
YES
I MAY AS WELL ACCOMPANY YOU A STEP OF THE WAY NOT UP TO THE RECTORY
THOUGH LEST MY OLD FRIEND HELSTONE SHOULD SHOOT ME FROM THE WINDOW
HE LAUGHED AND TOOK HIS HAT
CAROLINE SPOKE OF UNNECESSARY TROUBLE HE
TOLD HER TO PUT ON HER BONNET AND SHAWL
SHE WAS QUICKLY READY AND THEY
WERE SOON BOTH IN THE OPEN AIR
MOORE DREW HER HAND UNDER HIS ARM JUST
IN HIS OLD MANNER THAT MANNER WHICH SHE EVER FELT TO BE SO KIND
YOU MAY RUN ON FANNY HE SAID TO THE HOUSEMAID WE SHALL OVERTAKE
YOU AND WHEN THE GIRL HAD GOT A LITTLE IN ADVANCE HE ENCLOSED
CAROLINE'S HAND IN HIS AND SAID HE WAS GLAD TO FIND SHE WAS A FAMILIAR
GUEST AT FIELDHEAD
HE HOPED HER INTIMACY WITH MISS KEELDAR WOULD
CONTINUE SUCH SOCIETY WOULD BE BOTH PLEASANT AND IMPROVING
CAROLINE REPLIED THAT SHE LIKED SHIRLEY
AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THE LIKING IS MUTUAL SAID MOORE
IF SHE
PROFESSES FRIENDSHIP BE CERTAIN SHE IS SINCERE
SHE CANNOT FEIGN SHE
SCORNS HYPOCRISY
AND CAROLINE ARE WE NEVER TO SEE YOU AT HOLLOW'S
COTTAGE AGAIN
I SUPPOSE NOT UNLESS MY UNCLE SHOULD CHANGE HIS MIND
ARE YOU MUCH ALONE NOW
YES A GOOD DEAL
I HAVE LITTLE PLEASURE IN ANY SOCIETY BUT MISS
KEELDAR'S
HAVE YOU BEEN QUITE WELL LATELY
QUITE
YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
BE SURE NOT TO NEGLECT EXERCISE
DO YOU
KNOW I FANCIED YOU SOMEWHAT ALTERED A LITTLE FALLEN AWAY AND PALE
IS
YOUR UNCLE KIND TO YOU
YES HE IS JUST AS HE ALWAYS IS
NOT TOO TENDER THAT IS TO SAY NOT TOO PROTECTIVE AND ATTENTIVE
AND
WHAT AILS YOU THEN TELL ME LINA
NOTHING ROBERT BUT HER VOICE FALTERED
THAT IS TO SAY NOTHING THAT YOU WILL TELL ME
I AM NOT TO BE TAKEN
INTO CONFIDENCE
SEPARATION IS THEN QUITE TO ESTRANGE US IS IT
I DO NOT KNOW
SOMETIMES I ALMOST FEAR IT IS
BUT IT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE THAT EFFECT
'SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE
FORGOT AND DAYS O' LANG SYNE
ROBERT I DON'T FORGET
IT IS TWO MONTHS I SHOULD THINK CAROLINE SINCE YOU WERE AT THE
COTTAGE
SINCE I WAS WITHIN IT YES
HAVE YOU EVER PASSED THAT WAY IN YOUR WALK
I HAVE COME TO THE TOP OF THE FIELDS SOMETIMES OF AN EVENING AND LOOKED
DOWN
ONCE I SAW HORTENSE IN THE GARDEN WATERING HER FLOWERS AND I KNOW
AT WHAT TIME YOU LIGHT YOUR LAMP IN THE COUNTING HOUSE
I HAVE WAITED
FOR IT TO SHINE OUT NOW AND THEN AND I HAVE SEEN YOU BEND BETWEEN IT
AND THE WINDOW
I KNEW IT WAS YOU I COULD ALMOST TRACE THE OUTLINE OF
YOUR FORM
I WONDER I NEVER ENCOUNTERED YOU
I OCCASIONALLY WALK TO THE TOP OF THE
HOLLOW'S FIELDS AFTER SUNSET
I KNOW YOU DO
I HAD ALMOST SPOKEN TO YOU ONE NIGHT YOU PASSED SO NEAR
ME
DID I I PASSED NEAR YOU AND DID NOT SEE YOU WAS I ALONE
I SAW YOU TWICE AND NEITHER TIME WERE YOU ALONE
WHO WAS MY COMPANION PROBABLY NOTHING BUT JOE SCOTT OR MY OWN SHADOW
BY MOONLIGHT
NO NEITHER JOE SCOTT NOR YOUR SHADOW ROBERT
THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE
WITH MR
YORKE AND THE SECOND TIME WHAT YOU CALL YOUR SHADOW WAS A
SHAPE WITH A WHITE FOREHEAD AND DARK CURLS AND A SPARKLING NECKLACE
ROUND ITS NECK
BUT I ONLY JUST GOT A GLIMPSE OF YOU AND THAT FAIRY
SHADOW I DID NOT WAIT TO HEAR YOU CONVERSE
IT APPEARS YOU WALK INVISIBLE
I NOTICED A RING ON YOUR HAND THIS
EVENING CAN IT BE THE RING OF GYGES HENCEFORTH WHEN SITTING IN THE
COUNTING HOUSE BY MYSELF PERHAPS AT DEAD OF NIGHT I SHALL PERMIT
MYSELF TO IMAGINE THAT CAROLINE MAY BE LEANING OVER MY SHOULDER READING
WITH ME FROM THE SAME BOOK OR SITTING AT MY SIDE ENGAGED IN HER OWN
PARTICULAR TASK AND NOW AND THEN RAISING HER UNSEEN EYES TO MY FACE TO
READ THERE MY THOUGHTS
YOU NEED FEAR NO SUCH INFLICTION
I DO NOT COME NEAR YOU I ONLY STAND
AFAR OFF WATCHING WHAT MAY BECOME OF YOU
WHEN I WALK OUT ALONG THE HEDGEROWS IN THE EVENING AFTER THE MILL IS
SHUT OR AT NIGHT WHEN I TAKE THE WATCHMAN'S PLACE I SHALL FANCY THE
FLUTTER OF EVERY LITTLE BIRD OVER ITS NEST THE RUSTLE OF EVERY LEAF A
MOVEMENT MADE BY YOU TREE SHADOWS WILL TAKE YOUR SHAPE IN THE WHITE
SPRAYS OF HAWTHORN I SHALL IMAGINE GLIMPSES OF YOU
LINA YOU WILL HAUNT
ME
I WILL NEVER BE WHERE YOU WOULD NOT WISH ME TO BE NOR SEE NOR HEAR
WHAT YOU WOULD WISH UNSEEN AND UNHEARD
I SHALL SEE YOU IN MY VERY MILL IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
INDEED I HAVE SEEN
YOU THERE ONCE
BUT A WEEK AGO I WAS STANDING AT THE TOP OF ONE OF MY
LONG ROOMS GIRLS WERE WORKING AT THE OTHER END AND AMONGST HALF A
DOZEN OF THEM MOVING TO AND FRO I SEEMED TO SEE A FIGURE RESEMBLING
YOURS
IT WAS SOME EFFECT OF DOUBTFUL LIGHT OR SHADE OR OF DAZZLING
SUNBEAM
I WALKED UP TO THIS GROUP
WHAT I SOUGHT HAD GLIDED AWAY I
FOUND MYSELF BETWEEN TWO BUXOM LASSES IN PINAFORES
I SHALL NOT FOLLOW YOU INTO YOUR MILL ROBERT UNLESS YOU CALL ME
THERE
NOR IS THAT THE ONLY OCCASION ON WHICH IMAGINATION HAS PLAYED ME A
TRICK
ONE NIGHT WHEN I CAME HOME LATE FROM MARKET I WALKED INTO THE
COTTAGE PARLOUR THINKING TO FIND HORTENSE BUT INSTEAD OF HER I THOUGHT
I FOUND YOU
THERE WAS NO CANDLE IN THE ROOM MY SISTER HAD TAKEN THE
LIGHT UPSTAIRS WITH HER
THE WINDOW BLIND WAS NOT DRAWN AND BROAD
MOONBEAMS POURED THROUGH THE PANES
THERE YOU WERE LINA AT THE
CASEMENT SHRINKING A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE IN AN ATTITUDE NOT UNUSUAL WITH
YOU
YOU WERE DRESSED IN WHITE AS I HAVE SEEN YOU DRESSED AT AN EVENING
PARTY
FOR HALF A SECOND YOUR FRESH LIVING FACE SEEMED TURNED TOWARDS
ME LOOKING AT ME FOR HALF A SECOND MY IDEA WAS TO GO AND TAKE YOUR
HAND TO CHIDE YOU FOR YOUR LONG ABSENCE AND WELCOME YOUR PRESENT
VISIT
TWO STEPS FORWARD BROKE THE SPELL
THE DRAPERY OF THE DRESS
CHANGED OUTLINE THE TINTS OF THE COMPLEXION DISSOLVED AND WERE
FORMLESS
POSITIVELY AS I REACHED THE SPOT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT
THE SWEEP OF A WHITE MUSLIN CURTAIN AND A BALSAM PLANT IN A FLOWER POT
COVERED WITH A FLUSH OF BLOOM
'SIC TRANSIT ET CETERA
IT WAS NOT MY WRAITH THEN I ALMOST THOUGHT IT WAS
NO ONLY GAUZE CROCKERY AND PINK BLOSSOM A SAMPLE OF EARTHLY
ILLUSIONS
I WONDER YOU HAVE TIME FOR SUCH ILLUSIONS OCCUPIED AS YOUR MIND MUST
BE
SO DO I
BUT I FIND IN MYSELF LINA TWO NATURES ONE FOR THE WORLD AND
BUSINESS AND ONE FOR HOME AND LEISURE
GRARD MOORE IS A HARD DOG
BROUGHT UP TO MILL AND MARKET THE PERSON YOU CALL YOUR COUSIN ROBERT IS
SOMETIMES A DREAMER WHO LIVES ELSEWHERE THAN IN CLOTH HALL AND
COUNTING HOUSE
YOUR TWO NATURES AGREE WITH YOU
I THINK YOU ARE LOOKING IN GOOD
SPIRITS AND HEALTH
YOU HAVE QUITE LOST THAT HARASSED AIR WHICH IT OFTEN
PAINED ONE TO SEE IN YOUR FACE A FEW MONTHS AGO
DO YOU OBSERVE THAT CERTAINLY I AM DISENTANGLED OF SOME DIFFICULTIES
I HAVE GOT CLEAR OF SOME SHOALS AND HAVE MORE SEA ROOM
AND WITH A FAIR WIND YOU MAY NOW HOPE TO MAKE A PROSPEROUS VOYAGE
I MAY HOPE IT YES BUT HOPE IS DECEPTIVE
THERE IS NO CONTROLLING
WIND OR WAVE
GUSTS AND SWELLS PERPETUALLY TROUBLE THE MARINER'S
COURSE HE DARE NOT DISMISS FROM HIS MIND THE EXPECTATION OF TEMPEST
BUT YOU ARE READY FOR A BREEZE YOU ARE A GOOD SEAMAN AN ABLE
COMMANDER
YOU ARE A SKILFUL PILOT ROBERT YOU WILL WEATHER THE STORM
MY KINSWOMAN ALWAYS THINKS THE BEST OF ME BUT I WILL TAKE HER WORDS
FOR A PROPITIOUS OMEN
I WILL CONSIDER THAT IN MEETING HER TO NIGHT I
HAVE MET WITH ONE OF THOSE BIRDS WHOSE APPEARANCE IS TO THE SAILOR THE
HARBINGER OF GOOD LUCK
A POOR HARBINGER OF GOOD LUCK IS SHE WHO CAN DO NOTHING WHO HAS NO
POWER
I FEEL MY INCAPACITY
IT IS OF NO USE SAYING I HAVE THE WILL TO
SERVE YOU WHEN I CANNOT PROVE IT
YET I HAVE THAT WILL
I WISH YOU
SUCCESS
I WISH YOU HIGH FORTUNE AND TRUE HAPPINESS
WHEN DID YOU EVER WISH ME ANYTHING ELSE WHAT IS FANNY WAITING FOR I
TOLD HER TO WALK ON
OH WE HAVE REACHED THE CHURCHYARD
THEN WE ARE TO
PART HERE I SUPPOSE
WE MIGHT HAVE SAT A FEW MINUTES IN THE CHURCH
PORCH IF THE GIRL HAD NOT BEEN WITH US
IT IS SO FINE A NIGHT SO
SUMMER MILD AND STILL I HAVE NO PARTICULAR WISH TO RETURN YET TO THE
HOLLOW
BUT WE CANNOT SIT IN THE PORCH NOW ROBERT
CAROLINE SAID THIS BECAUSE MOORE WAS TURNING HER ROUND TOWARDS IT
PERHAPS NOT
BUT TELL FANNY TO GO IN
SAY WE ARE COMING
A FEW MINUTES
WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
THE CHURCH CLOCK STRUCK TEN
MY UNCLE WILL BE COMING OUT TO TAKE HIS USUAL SENTINEL ROUND AND HE
ALWAYS SURVEYS THE CHURCH AND CHURCHYARD
AND IF HE DOES IF IT WERE NOT FOR FANNY WHO KNOWS WE ARE HERE I
SHOULD FIND PLEASURE IN DODGING AND ELUDING HIM
WE COULD BE UNDER THE
EAST WINDOW WHEN HE IS AT THE PORCH AS HE CAME ROUND TO THE NORTH SIDE
WE COULD WHEEL OFF TO THE SOUTH WE MIGHT AT A PINCH HIDE BEHIND SOME OF
THE MONUMENTS
THAT TALL ERECTION OF THE WYNNES WOULD SCREEN US
COMPLETELY
ROBERT WHAT GOOD SPIRITS YOU HAVE GO GO ADDED CAROLINE HASTILY
I
HEAR THE FRONT DOOR
I DON'T WANT TO GO ON THE CONTRARY I WANT TO STAY
YOU KNOW MY UNCLE WILL BE TERRIBLY ANGRY
HE FORBADE ME TO SEE YOU
BECAUSE YOU ARE A JACOBIN
A QUEER JACOBIN
GO ROBERT HE IS COMING I HEAR HIM COUGH
DIABLE IT IS STRANGE WHAT A PERTINACIOUS WISH I FEEL TO STAY
YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE DID TO FANNY'S BEGAN CAROLINE AND STOPPED
ABRUPTLY SHORT
SWEETHEART WAS THE WORD THAT OUGHT TO HAVE FOLLOWED
BUT SHE COULD NOT UTTER IT
IT SEEMED CALCULATED TO SUGGEST IDEAS SHE
HAD NO INTENTION TO SUGGEST IDEAS DELUSIVE AND DISTURBING
MOORE WAS
LESS SCRUPULOUS
FANNY'S SWEETHEART HE SAID AT ONCE
HE GAVE HIM A
SHOWER BATH UNDER THE PUMP DID HE NOT HE'D DO AS MUCH FOR ME I DARE
SAY WITH PLEASURE
I SHOULD LIKE TO PROVOKE THE OLD TURK NOT HOWEVER
AGAINST YOU
BUT HE WOULD MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A COUSIN AND A
LOVER WOULD HE NOT
OH HE WOULD NOT THINK OF YOU IN THAT WAY OF COURSE NOT HIS QUARREL
WITH YOU IS ENTIRELY POLITICAL
YET I SHOULD NOT LIKE THE BREACH TO BE
WIDENED AND HE IS SO TESTY
HERE HE IS AT THE GARDEN GATE
FOR YOUR OWN
SAKE AND MINE ROBERT GO
THE BESEECHING WORDS WERE AIDED BY A BESEECHING GESTURE AND A MORE
BESEECHING LOOK
MOORE COVERED HER CLASPED HANDS AN INSTANT WITH HIS
ANSWERED HER UPWARD BY A DOWNWARD GAZE SAID GOOD NIGHT AND WENT
CAROLINE WAS IN A MOMENT AT THE KITCHEN DOOR BEHIND FANNY
THE SHADOW OF
THE SHOVEL HAT AT THAT VERY INSTANT FELL ON A MOONLIT TOMB
THE RECTOR
EMERGED ERECT AS A CANE FROM HIS GARDEN AND PROCEEDED IN SLOW MARCH
HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM DOWN THE CEMETERY
MOORE WAS ALMOST CAUGHT
HE HAD
TO DODGE AFTER ALL TO COAST ROUND THE CHURCH AND FINALLY TO BEND HIS
TALL FORM BEHIND THE WYNNES' AMBITIOUS MONUMENT
THERE HE WAS FORCED TO
HIDE FULL TEN MINUTES KNEELING WITH ONE KNEE ON THE TURF HIS HAT OFF
HIS CURLS BARE TO THE DEW HIS DARK EYE SHINING AND HIS LIPS PARTED
WITH INWARD LAUGHTER AT HIS POSITION FOR THE RECTOR MEANTIME STOOD
COOLLY STAR GAZING AND TAKING SNUFF WITHIN THREE FEET OF HIM
IT HAPPENED HOWEVER THAT MR
HELSTONE HAD NO SUSPICION WHATEVER ON HIS
MIND FOR BEING USUALLY BUT VAGUELY INFORMED OF HIS NIECE'S MOVEMENTS
NOT THINKING IT WORTH WHILE TO FOLLOW THEM CLOSELY HE WAS NOT AWARE
THAT SHE HAD BEEN OUT AT ALL THAT DAY AND IMAGINED HER THEN OCCUPIED
WITH BOOK OR WORK IN HER CHAMBER WHERE INDEED SHE WAS BY THIS TIME
THOUGH NOT ABSORBED IN THE TRANQUIL EMPLOYMENT HE ASCRIBED TO HER BUT
STANDING AT HER WINDOW WITH FAST THROBBING HEART PEEPING ANXIOUSLY FROM
BEHIND THE BLIND WATCHING FOR HER UNCLE TO RE ENTER AND HER COUSIN TO
ESCAPE
AND AT LAST SHE WAS GRATIFIED
SHE HEARD MR
HELSTONE COME IN
SHE SAW ROBERT STRIDE THE TOMBS AND VAULT THE WALL SHE THEN WENT DOWN
TO PRAYERS
WHEN SHE RETURNED TO HER CHAMBER IT WAS TO MEET THE MEMORY
OF ROBERT
SLUMBER'S VISITATION WAS LONG AVERTED
LONG SHE SAT AT HER
LATTICE LONG GAZED DOWN ON THE OLD GARDEN AND OLDER CHURCH ON THE
TOMBS LAID OUT ALL GRAY AND CALM AND CLEAR IN MOONLIGHT
SHE FOLLOWED
THE STEPS OF THE NIGHT ON ITS PATHWAY OF STARS FAR INTO THE WEE SMA'
HOURS AYONT THE TWAL' SHE WAS WITH MOORE IN SPIRIT THE WHOLE TIME
SHE WAS AT HIS SIDE SHE HEARD HIS VOICE SHE GAVE HER HAND INTO HIS
HAND IT RESTED WARM IN HIS FINGERS
WHEN THE CHURCH CLOCK STRUCK WHEN
ANY OTHER SOUND STIRRED WHEN A LITTLE MOUSE FAMILIAR TO HER CHAMBER AN
INTRUDER FOR WHICH SHE WOULD NEVER PERMIT FANNY TO LAY A TRAP CAME
RATTLING AMONGST THE LINKS OF HER LOCKET CHAIN HER ONE RING AND
ANOTHER TRINKET OR TWO ON THE TOILET TABLE TO NIBBLE A BIT OF BISCUIT
LAID READY FOR IT SHE LOOKED UP RECALLED MOMENTARILY TO THE REAL
THEN
SHE SAID HALF ALOUD AS IF DEPRECATING THE ACCUSATION OF SOME UNSEEN AND
UNHEARD MONITOR I AM NOT CHERISHING LOVE DREAMS I AM ONLY THINKING
BECAUSE I CANNOT SLEEP
OF COURSE I KNOW HE WILL MARRY SHIRLEY
WITH RETURNING SILENCE WITH THE LULL OF THE CHIME AND THE RETREAT OF
HER SMALL UNTAMED AND UNKNOWN PROTG SHE STILL RESUMED THE DREAM
NESTLING TO THE VISION'S SIDE LISTENING TO CONVERSING WITH IT
IT
PALED AT LAST
AS DAWN APPROACHED THE SETTING STARS AND BREAKING DAY
DIMMED THE CREATION OF FANCY THE WAKENED SONG OF BIRDS HUSHED HER
WHISPERS
THE TALE FULL OF FIRE QUICK WITH INTEREST BORNE AWAY BY THE
MORNING WIND BECAME A VAGUE MURMUR
THE SHAPE THAT SEEN IN A MOONBEAM
LIVED HAD A PULSE HAD MOVEMENT WORE HEALTH'S GLOW AND YOUTH'S
FRESHNESS TURNED COLD AND GHOSTLY GRAY CONFRONTED WITH THE RED OF
SUNRISE
IT WASTED
SHE WAS LEFT SOLITARY AT LAST
SHE CREPT TO HER
COUCH CHILL AND DEJECTED
CHAPTER XIV
SHIRLEY SEEKS TO BE SAVED BY WORKS
OF COURSE I KNOW HE WILL MARRY SHIRLEY WERE HER FIRST WORDS WHEN SHE
ROSE IN THE MORNING
AND HE OUGHT TO MARRY HER
SHE CAN HELP HIM SHE
ADDED FIRMLY
BUT I SHALL BE FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY ARE MARRIED WAS
THE CRUEL SUCCEEDING THOUGHT
OH I SHALL BE WHOLLY FORGOTTEN AND
WHAT WHAT SHALL I DO WHEN ROBERT IS TAKEN QUITE FROM ME WHERE SHALL
I TURN MY ROBERT I WISH I COULD JUSTLY CALL HIM MINE
BUT I AM
POVERTY AND INCAPACITY SHIRLEY IS WEALTH AND POWER
AND SHE IS BEAUTY
TOO AND LOVE
I CANNOT DENY IT
THIS IS NO SORDID SUIT
SHE LOVES
HIM NOT WITH INFERIOR FEELINGS
SHE LOVES OR WILL LOVE AS HE MUST
FEEL PROUD TO BE LOVED
NOT A VALID OBJECTION CAN BE MADE
LET THEM BE
MARRIED THEN
BUT AFTERWARDS I SHALL BE NOTHING TO HIM
AS FOR BEING
HIS SISTER AND ALL THAT STUFF I DESPISE IT
I WILL EITHER BE ALL OR
NOTHING TO A MAN LIKE ROBERT NO FEEBLE SHUFFLING OR FALSE CANT IS
ENDURABLE
ONCE LET THAT PAIR BE UNITED AND I WILL CERTAINLY LEAVE
THEM
AS FOR LINGERING ABOUT PLAYING THE HYPOCRITE AND PRETENDING TO
CALM SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP WHEN MY SOUL WILL BE WRUNG WITH OTHER
FEELINGS I SHALL NOT DESCEND TO SUCH DEGRADATION
AS LITTLE COULD I
FILL THE PLACE OF THEIR MUTUAL FRIEND AS THAT OF THEIR DEADLY FOE AS
LITTLE COULD I STAND BETWEEN THEM AS TRAMPLE OVER THEM
ROBERT IS A
FIRST RATE MAN IN MY EYES
I HAVE LOVED DO LOVE AND MUST LOVE
HIM
I WOULD BE HIS WIFE IF I COULD AS I CANNOT I MUST GO WHERE I
SHALL NEVER SEE HIM
THERE IS BUT ONE ALTERNATIVE TO CLEAVE TO HIM AS
IF I WERE A PART OF HIM OR TO BE SUNDERED FROM HIM WIDE AS THE TWO
POLES OF A SPHERE SUNDER ME THEN PROVIDENCE
PART US SPEEDILY
SOME SUCH ASPIRATIONS AS THESE WERE AGAIN WORKING IN HER MIND LATE IN
THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE APPARITION OF ONE OF THE PERSONAGES HAUNTING HER
THOUGHTS PASSED THE PARLOUR WINDOW
MISS KEELDAR SAUNTERED SLOWLY BY
HER GAIT HER COUNTENANCE WEARING THAT MIXTURE OF WISTFULNESS AND
CARELESSNESS WHICH WHEN QUIESCENT WAS THE WONTED CAST OF HER LOOK AND
CHARACTER OF HER BEARING
WHEN ANIMATED THE CARELESSNESS QUITE
VANISHED THE WISTFULNESS BECAME BLENT WITH A GENIAL GAIETY SEASONING
THE LAUGH THE SMILE THE GLANCE WITH A UNIQUE FLAVOUR OF SENTIMENT SO
THAT MIRTH FROM HER NEVER RESEMBLED THE CRACKLING OF THORNS UNDER A
POT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY NOT COMING TO SEE ME THIS AFTERNOON AS YOU
PROMISED WAS HER ADDRESS TO CAROLINE AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
I WAS NOT IN THE HUMOUR REPLIED MISS HELSTONE VERY TRULY
SHIRLEY HAD ALREADY FIXED ON HER A PENETRATING EYE
NO SHE SAID I SEE YOU ARE NOT IN THE HUMOUR FOR LOVING ME
YOU ARE
IN ONE OF YOUR SUNLESS INCLEMENT MOODS WHEN ONE FEELS A
FELLOW CREATURE'S PRESENCE IS NOT WELCOME TO YOU
YOU HAVE SUCH MOODS
ARE YOU AWARE OF IT
DO YOU MEAN TO STAY LONG SHIRLEY
YES
I AM COME TO HAVE MY TEA AND MUST HAVE IT BEFORE I GO
I SHALL
TAKE THE LIBERTY THEN OF REMOVING MY BONNET WITHOUT BEING ASKED
AND THIS SHE DID AND THEN STOOD ON THE RUG WITH HER HANDS BEHIND HER
A PRETTY EXPRESSION YOU HAVE IN YOUR COUNTENANCE SHE WENT ON STILL
GAZING KEENLY THOUGH NOT INIMICALLY RATHER INDEED PITYINGLY AT
CAROLINE
WONDERFULLY SELF SUPPORTED YOU LOOK YOU SOLITUDE SEEKING
WOUNDED DEER
ARE YOU AFRAID SHIRLEY WILL WORRY YOU IF SHE DISCOVERS
THAT YOU ARE HURT AND THAT YOU BLEED
I NEVER DO FEAR SHIRLEY
BUT SOMETIMES YOU DISLIKE HER OFTEN YOU AVOID HER
SHIRLEY CAN FEEL
WHEN SHE IS SLIGHTED AND SHUNNED
IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED HOME IN THE
COMPANY YOU DID LAST NIGHT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT GIRL TO DAY
WHAT TIME DID YOU REACH THE RECTORY
BY TEN
HUMPH YOU TOOK THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR TO WALK A MILE
WAS IT YOU
OR MOORE WHO LINGERED SO
SHIRLEY YOU TALK NONSENSE
HE TALKED NONSENSE THAT I DOUBT NOT OR HE LOOKED IT WHICH IS A
THOUSAND TIMES WORSE
I SEE THE REFLECTION OF HIS EYES ON YOUR FOREHEAD
AT THIS MOMENT
I FEEL DISPOSED TO CALL HIM OUT IF I COULD ONLY GET A
TRUSTWORTHY SECOND
I FEEL DESPERATELY IRRITATED
I FELT SO LAST NIGHT
AND HAVE FELT IT ALL DAY
YOU DON'T ASK ME WHY SHE PROCEEDED AFTER A PAUSE YOU LITTLE
SILENT OVER MODEST THING AND YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT I SHOULD POUR OUT
MY SECRETS INTO YOUR LAP WITHOUT AN INVITATION
UPON MY WORD I COULD
HAVE FOUND IT IN MY HEART TO HAVE DOGGED MOORE YESTERDAY EVENING WITH
DIRE INTENT
I HAVE PISTOLS AND CAN USE THEM
STUFF SHIRLEY WHICH WOULD YOU HAVE SHOT ME OR ROBERT
NEITHER PERHAPS
PERHAPS MYSELF MORE LIKELY A BAT OR A TREE BOUGH
HE
IS A PUPPY YOUR COUSIN A QUIET SERIOUS SENSIBLE JUDICIOUS
AMBITIOUS PUPPY
I SEE HIM STANDING BEFORE ME TALKING HIS HALF STERN
HALF GENTLE TALK BEARING ME DOWN AS I AM VERY CONSCIOUS HE DOES WITH
HIS FIXITY OF PURPOSE ETC AND THEN I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH HIM
MISS KEELDAR STARTED OFF ON A RAPID WALK THROUGH THE ROOM REPEATING
ENERGETICALLY THAT SHE HAD NO PATIENCE WITH MEN IN GENERAL AND WITH HER
TENANT IN PARTICULAR
YOU ARE MISTAKEN URGED CAROLINE IN SOME ANXIETY
ROBERT IS NO PUPPY
OR MALE FLIRT I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT
YOU VOUCH FOR IT DO YOU THINK I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD ON THE SUBJECT
THERE IS NO ONE'S TESTIMONY I WOULD NOT CREDIT SOONER THAN YOURS
TO
ADVANCE MOORE'S FORTUNE YOU WOULD CUT OFF YOUR RIGHT HAND
BUT NOT TELL LIES
AND IF I SPEAK THE TRUTH I MUST ASSURE YOU THAT HE
WAS JUST CIVIL TO ME LAST NIGHT THAT WAS ALL
I NEVER ASKED WHAT HE WAS
I CAN GUESS
I SAW HIM FROM THE WINDOW TAKE
YOUR HAND IN HIS LONG FINGERS JUST AS HE WENT OUT AT MY GATE
THAT IS NOTHING
I AM NOT A STRANGER YOU KNOW
I AM AN OLD
ACQUAINTANCE AND HIS COUSIN
I FEEL INDIGNANT AND THAT IS THE LONG AND SHORT OF THE MATTER
RESPONDED MISS KEELDAR
ALL MY COMFORT SHE ADDED PRESENTLY IS
BROKEN UP BY HIS MANUVRES
HE KEEPS INTRUDING BETWEEN YOU AND ME
WITHOUT HIM WE SHOULD BE GOOD FRIENDS BUT THAT SIX FEET OF PUPPYHOOD
MAKES A PERPETUALLY RECURRING ECLIPSE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP
AGAIN AND AGAIN
HE CROSSES AND OBSCURES THE DISC I WANT ALWAYS TO SEE CLEAR EVER AND
ANON HE RENDERS ME TO YOU A MERE BORE AND NUISANCE
NO SHIRLEY NO
HE DOES
YOU DID NOT WANT MY SOCIETY THIS AFTERNOON AND I FEEL IT
HARD
YOU ARE NATURALLY SOMEWHAT RESERVED BUT I AM A SOCIAL PERSONAGE
WHO CANNOT LIVE ALONE
IF WE WERE BUT LEFT UNMOLESTED I HAVE THAT
REGARD FOR YOU THAT I COULD BEAR YOU IN MY PRESENCE FOR EVER AND NOT
FOR THE FRACTION OF A SECOND DO I EVER WISH TO BE RID OF YOU
YOU CANNOT
SAY AS MUCH RESPECTING ME
SHIRLEY I CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WISH
SHIRLEY I LIKE YOU
YOU WILL WISH ME AT JERICHO TO MORROW LINA
I SHALL NOT
I AM EVERY DAY GROWING MORE ACCUSTOMED TO FONDER OF YOU
YOU KNOW I AM TOO ENGLISH TO GET UP A VEHEMENT FRIENDSHIP ALL AT ONCE
BUT YOU ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN COMMON YOU ARE SO DIFFERENT TO
EVERY DAY YOUNG LADIES I ESTEEM YOU I VALUE YOU YOU ARE NEVER A
BURDEN TO ME NEVER
DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT I SAY
PARTLY REPLIED MISS KEELDAR SMILING RATHER INCREDULOUSLY BUT YOU
ARE A PECULIAR PERSONAGE
QUIET AS YOU LOOK THERE IS BOTH A FORCE AND A
DEPTH SOMEWHERE WITHIN NOT EASILY REACHED OR APPRECIATED
THEN YOU
CERTAINLY ARE NOT HAPPY
AND UNHAPPY PEOPLE ARE RARELY GOOD
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN
NOT AT ALL
I MEAN RATHER THAT UNHAPPY PEOPLE ARE OFTEN PREOCCUPIED
AND NOT IN THE MOOD FOR DISCOURSING WITH COMPANIONS OF MY NATURE
MOREOVER THERE IS A SORT OF UNHAPPINESS WHICH NOT ONLY DEPRESSES BUT
CORRODES AND THAT I FEAR IS YOUR PORTION
WILL PITY DO YOU ANY GOOD
LINA IF IT WILL TAKE SOME FROM SHIRLEY SHE OFFERS LARGELY AND
WARRANTS THE ARTICLE GENUINE
SHIRLEY I NEVER HAD A SISTER YOU NEVER HAD A SISTER BUT IT FLASHES
ON ME AT THIS MOMENT HOW SISTERS FEEL TOWARDS EACH OTHER AFFECTION
TWINED WITH THEIR LIFE WHICH NO SHOCKS OF FEELING CAN UPROOT WHICH
LITTLE QUARRELS ONLY TRAMPLE AN INSTANT THAT IT MAY SPRING MORE FRESHLY
WHEN THE PRESSURE IS REMOVED AFFECTION THAT NO PASSION CAN ULTIMATELY
OUTRIVAL WITH WHICH EVEN LOVE ITSELF CANNOT DO MORE THAN COMPETE IN
FORCE AND TRUTH
LOVE HURTS US SO SHIRLEY
IT IS SO TORMENTING SO
RACKING AND IT BURNS AWAY OUR STRENGTH WITH ITS FLAME
IN AFFECTION IS
NO PAIN AND NO FIRE ONLY SUSTENANCE AND BALM
I AM SUPPORTED AND
SOOTHED WHEN YOU THAT IS YOU ONLY ARE NEAR SHIRLEY
DO YOU
BELIEVE ME NOW
I AM ALWAYS EASY OF BELIEF WHEN THE CREED PLEASES ME
WE REALLY ARE
FRIENDS THEN LINA IN SPITE OF THE BLACK ECLIPSE
WE REALLY ARE RETURNED THE OTHER DRAWING SHIRLEY TOWARDS HER AND
MAKING HER SIT DOWN CHANCE WHAT MAY
COME THEN WE WILL TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE THAN THE TROUBLER BUT AT
THIS MOMENT THE RECTOR CAME IN AND THE SOMETHING ELSE OF WHICH MISS
KEELDAR WAS ABOUT TO TALK WAS NOT AGAIN ALLUDED TO TILL THE MOMENT OF
HER DEPARTURE
SHE THEN DELAYED A FEW MINUTES IN THE PASSAGE TO SAY
CAROLINE I WISH TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A GREAT WEIGHT ON MY MIND MY
CONSCIENCE IS QUITE UNEASY AS IF I HAD COMMITTED OR WAS GOING TO
COMMIT A CRIME
IT IS NOT MY PRIVATE CONSCIENCE YOU MUST UNDERSTAND
BUT MY LANDED PROPRIETOR AND LORD OF THE MANOR CONSCIENCE
I HAVE GOT
INTO THE CLUTCH OF AN EAGLE WITH IRON TALONS
I HAVE FALLEN UNDER A
STERN INFLUENCE WHICH I SCARCELY APPROVE BUT CANNOT RESIST
SOMETHING
WILL BE DONE ERE LONG I FEAR WHICH IT BY NO MEANS PLEASES ME TO THINK
OF
TO EASE MY MIND AND TO PREVENT HARM AS FAR AS I CAN I MEAN TO
ENTER ON A SERIES OF GOOD WORKS
DON'T BE SURPRISED THEREFORE IF YOU
SEE ME ALL AT ONCE TURN OUTRAGEOUSLY CHARITABLE
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO
BEGIN BUT YOU MUST GIVE ME SOME ADVICE
WE WILL TALK MORE ON THE
SUBJECT TO MORROW AND JUST ASK THAT EXCELLENT PERSON MISS AINLEY TO
STEP UP TO FIELDHEAD
I HAVE SOME NOTION OF PUTTING MYSELF UNDER HER
TUITION
WON'T SHE HAVE A PRECIOUS PUPIL DROP A HINT TO HER LINA
THAT THOUGH A WELL MEANING I AM RATHER A NEGLECTED CHARACTER AND THEN
SHE WILL FEEL LESS SCANDALIZED AT MY IGNORANCE ABOUT CLOTHING SOCIETIES
AND SUCH THINGS
ON THE MORROW CAROLINE FOUND SHIRLEY SITTING GRAVELY AT HER DESK WITH
AN ACCOUNT BOOK A BUNDLE OF BANKNOTES AND A WELL FILLED PURSE BEFORE
HER
SHE WAS LOOKING MIGHTY SERIOUS BUT A LITTLE PUZZLED
SHE SAID SHE
HAD BEEN CASTING AN EYE OVER THE WEEKLY EXPENDITURE IN HOUSEKEEPING AT
THE HALL TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE SHE COULD RETRENCH THAT SHE HAD ALSO
JUST GIVEN AUDIENCE TO MRS
GILL THE COOK AND HAD SENT THAT PERSON
AWAY WITH A NOTION THAT HER SHIRLEY'S BRAIN WAS CERTAINLY CRAZED
I
HAVE LECTURED HER ON THE DUTY OF BEING CAREFUL SAID SHE IN A WAY
QUITE NEW TO HER
SO ELOQUENT WAS I ON THE TEXT OF ECONOMY THAT I
SURPRISED MYSELF FOR YOU SEE IT IS ALTOGETHER A FRESH IDEA
I NEVER
THOUGHT MUCH LESS SPOKE ON THE SUBJECT TILL LATELY
BUT IT IS ALL
THEORY FOR WHEN I CAME TO THE PRACTICAL PART I COULD RETRENCH NOTHING
I HAD NOT FIRMNESS TO TAKE OFF A SINGLE POUND OF BUTTER OR TO PROSECUTE
TO ANY CLEAR RESULT AN INQUEST INTO THE DESTINY OF EITHER DRIPPING
LARD BREAD COLD MEAT OR OTHER KITCHEN PERQUISITE WHATEVER
I KNOW WE
NEVER GET UP ILLUMINATIONS AT FIELDHEAD BUT I COULD NOT ASK THE MEANING
OF SUNDRY QUITE UNACCOUNTABLE POUNDS OF CANDLES
WE DO NOT WASH FOR THE
PARISH YET I VIEWED IN SILENCE ITEMS OF SOAP AND BLEACHING POWDER
CALCULATED TO SATISFY THE SOLICITUDE OF THE MOST ANXIOUS INQUIRER AFTER
OUR POSITION IN REFERENCE TO THOSE ARTICLES
CARNIVOROUS I AM NOT NOR
IS MRS
PRYOR NOR IS MRS
GILL HERSELF YET I ONLY HEMMED AND OPENED MY
EYES A LITTLE WIDE WHEN I SAW BUTCHERS' BILLS WHOSE FIGURES SEEMED TO
PROVE THAT FACT FALSEHOOD I MEAN
CAROLINE YOU MAY LAUGH AT ME BUT
YOU CAN'T CHANGE ME
I AM A POLTROON ON CERTAIN POINTS I FEEL IT
THERE
IS A BASE ALLOY OF MORAL COWARDICE IN MY COMPOSITION
I BLUSHED AND HUNG
MY HEAD BEFORE MRS
GILL WHEN SHE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FALTERING
CONFESSIONS TO ME
I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET UP THE SPIRIT EVEN TO
HINT MUCH LESS TO PROVE TO HER THAT SHE WAS A CHEAT
I HAVE NO CALM
DIGNITY NO TRUE COURAGE ABOUT ME
SHIRLEY WHAT FIT OF SELF INJUSTICE IS THIS MY UNCLE WHO IS NOT GIVEN
TO SPEAK WELL OF WOMEN SAYS THERE ARE NOT TEN THOUSAND MEN IN ENGLAND
AS GENUINELY FEARLESS AS YOU
I AM FEARLESS PHYSICALLY I AM NEVER NERVOUS ABOUT DANGER
I WAS NOT
STARTLED FROM SELF POSSESSION WHEN MR
WYNNE'S GREAT RED BULL ROSE WITH
A BELLOW BEFORE MY FACE AS I WAS CROSSING THE COWSLIP LEA ALONE
STOOPED HIS BEGRIMED SULLEN HEAD AND MADE A RUN AT ME BUT I WAS
AFRAID OF SEEING MRS
GILL BROUGHT TO SHAME AND CONFUSION OF FACE
YOU
HAVE TWICE TEN TIMES MY STRENGTH OF MIND ON CERTAIN SUBJECTS
CAROLINE
YOU WHOM NO PERSUASION CAN INDUCE TO PASS A BULL HOWEVER
QUIET HE LOOKS WOULD HAVE FIRMLY SHOWN MY HOUSEKEEPER SHE HAD DONE
WRONG THEN YOU WOULD HAVE GENTLY AND WISELY ADMONISHED HER AND AT
LAST I DARE SAY PROVIDED SHE HAD SEEMED PENITENT YOU WOULD HAVE VERY
SWEETLY FORGIVEN HER
OF THIS CONDUCT I AM INCAPABLE
HOWEVER IN SPITE
OF EXAGGERATED IMPOSITION I STILL FIND WE LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS
I HAVE
MONEY IN HAND AND I REALLY MUST DO SOME GOOD WITH IT
THE BRIARFIELD
POOR ARE BADLY OFF THEY MUST BE HELPED
WHAT OUGHT I TO DO THINK YOU
LINA HAD I NOT BETTER DISTRIBUTE THE CASH AT ONCE
NO INDEED SHIRLEY YOU WILL NOT MANAGE PROPERLY
I HAVE OFTEN NOTICED
THAT YOUR ONLY NOTION OF CHARITY IS TO GIVE SHILLINGS AND HALF CROWNS IN
A CARELESS FREE HANDED SORT OF WAY WHICH IS LIABLE TO CONTINUAL ABUSE
YOU MUST HAVE A PRIME MINISTER OR YOU WILL GET YOURSELF INTO A SERIES
OF SCRAPES
YOU SUGGESTED MISS AINLEY YOURSELF TO MISS AINLEY I WILL
APPLY
AND MEANTIME PROMISE TO KEEP QUIET AND NOT BEGIN THROWING AWAY
YOUR MONEY
WHAT A GREAT DEAL YOU HAVE SHIRLEY YOU MUST FEEL VERY RICH
WITH ALL THAT
YES I FEEL OF CONSEQUENCE
IT IS NOT AN IMMENSE SUM BUT I FEEL
RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS DISPOSAL AND REALLY THIS RESPONSIBILITY WEIGHS ON
MY MIND MORE HEAVILY THAN I COULD HAVE EXPECTED
THEY SAY THAT THERE ARE
SOME FAMILIES ALMOST STARVING TO DEATH IN BRIARFIELD
SOME OF MY OWN
COTTAGERS ARE IN WRETCHED CIRCUMSTANCES
I MUST AND WILL HELP THEM
SOME PEOPLE SAY WE SHOULDN'T GIVE ALMS TO THE POOR SHIRLEY
THEY ARE GREAT FOOLS FOR THEIR PAINS
FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT HUNGRY IT
IS EASY TO PALAVER ABOUT THE DEGRADATION OF CHARITY AND SO ON BUT THEY
FORGET THE BREVITY OF LIFE AS WELL AS ITS BITTERNESS
WE HAVE NONE OF
US LONG TO LIVE
LET US HELP EACH OTHER THROUGH SEASONS OF WANT AND WOE
AS WELL AS WE CAN WITHOUT HEEDING IN THE LEAST THE SCRUPLES OF VAIN
PHILOSOPHY
BUT YOU DO HELP OTHERS SHIRLEY
YOU GIVE A GREAT DEAL AS IT IS
NOT ENOUGH
I MUST GIVE MORE OR I TELL YOU MY BROTHER'S BLOOD WILL
SOME DAY BE CRYING TO HEAVEN AGAINST ME
FOR AFTER ALL IF POLITICAL
INCENDIARIES COME HERE TO KINDLE CONFLAGRATION IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND
MY PROPERTY IS ATTACKED I SHALL DEFEND IT LIKE A TIGRESS I KNOW I
SHALL
LET ME LISTEN TO MERCY AS LONG AS SHE IS NEAR ME
HER VOICE ONCE
DROWNED BY THE SHOUT OF RUFFIAN DEFIANCE AND I SHALL BE FULL OF
IMPULSES TO RESIST AND QUELL
IF ONCE THE POOR GATHER AND RISE IN THE
FORM OF THE MOB I SHALL TURN AGAINST THEM AS AN ARISTOCRAT IF THEY
BULLY ME I MUST DEFY IF THEY ATTACK I MUST RESIST AND I WILL
YOU TALK LIKE ROBERT
I FEEL LIKE ROBERT ONLY MORE FIERILY
LET THEM MEDDLE WITH ROBERT OR
ROBERT'S MILL OR ROBERT'S INTERESTS AND I SHALL HATE THEM
AT PRESENT
I AM NO PATRICIAN NOR DO I REGARD THE POOR AROUND ME AS PLEBEIANS BUT
IF ONCE THEY VIOLENTLY WRONG ME OR MINE AND THEN PRESUME TO DICTATE TO
US I SHALL QUITE FORGET PITY FOR THEIR WRETCHEDNESS AND RESPECT FOR
THEIR POVERTY IN SCORN OF THEIR IGNORANCE AND WRATH AT THEIR
INSOLENCE
SHIRLEY HOW YOUR EYES FLASH
BECAUSE MY SOUL BURNS
WOULD YOU ANY MORE THAN ME LET ROBERT BE BORNE
DOWN BY NUMBERS
IF I HAD YOUR POWER TO AID ROBERT I WOULD USE IT AS YOU MEAN TO USE
IT
IF I COULD BE SUCH A FRIEND TO HIM AS YOU CAN BE I WOULD STAND BY
HIM AS YOU MEAN TO STAND BY HIM TILL DEATH
AND NOW LINA THOUGH YOUR EYES DON'T FLASH THEY GLOW
YOU DROP YOUR
LIDS BUT I SAW A KINDLED SPARK
HOWEVER IT IS NOT YET COME TO
FIGHTING
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO PREVENT MISCHIEF
I CANNOT FORGET
EITHER DAY OR NIGHT THAT THESE EMBITTERED FEELINGS OF THE POOR AGAINST
THE RICH HAVE BEEN GENERATED IN SUFFERING THEY WOULD NEITHER HATE NOR
ENVY US IF THEY DID NOT DEEM US SO MUCH HAPPIER THAN THEMSELVES
TO
ALLAY THIS SUFFERING AND THEREBY LESSEN THIS HATE LET ME OUT OF MY
ABUNDANCE GIVE ABUNDANTLY AND THAT THE DONATION MAY GO FARTHER LET IT
BE MADE WISELY
TO THAT INTENT WE MUST INTRODUCE SOME CLEAR CALM
PRACTICAL SENSE INTO OUR COUNCILS
SO GO AND FETCH MISS AINLEY
WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD CAROLINE PUT ON HER BONNET AND DEPARTED
IT MAY
PERHAPS APPEAR STRANGE THAT NEITHER SHE NOR SHIRLEY THOUGHT OF
CONSULTING MRS
PRYOR ON THEIR SCHEME BUT THEY WERE WISE IN ABSTAINING
TO HAVE CONSULTED HER AND THIS THEY KNEW BY INSTINCT WOULD ONLY HAVE
BEEN TO INVOLVE HER IN PAINFUL EMBARRASSMENT
SHE WAS FAR BETTER
INFORMED BETTER READ A DEEPER THINKER THAN MISS AINLEY BUT OF
ADMINISTRATIVE ENERGY OF EXECUTIVE ACTIVITY SHE HAD NONE
SHE WOULD
SUBSCRIBE HER OWN MODEST MITE TO A CHARITABLE OBJECT WILLINGLY SECRET
ALMSGIVING SUITED HER BUT IN PUBLIC PLANS ON A LARGE SCALE SHE COULD
TAKE NO PART AS TO ORIGINATING THEM THAT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
THIS
SHIRLEY KNEW AND THEREFORE SHE DID NOT TROUBLE MRS
PRYOR BY UNAVAILING
CONFERENCES WHICH COULD ONLY REMIND HER OF HER OWN DEFICIENCIES AND DO
NO GOOD
IT WAS A BRIGHT DAY FOR MISS AINLEY WHEN SHE WAS SUMMONED TO FIELDHEAD
TO DELIBERATE ON PROJECTS SO CONGENIAL TO HER WHEN SHE WAS SEATED WITH
ALL HONOUR AND DEFERENCE AT A TABLE WITH PAPER PEN INK AND WHAT WAS
BEST OF ALL CASH BEFORE HER AND REQUESTED TO DRAW UP A REGULAR PLAN
FOR ADMINISTERING RELIEF TO THE DESTITUTE POOR OF BRIARFIELD
SHE WHO
KNEW THEM ALL HAD STUDIED THEIR WANTS HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN FELT IN WHAT
WAY THEY MIGHT BEST BE SUCCOURED COULD THE MEANS OF SUCCOUR ONLY BE
FOUND WAS FULLY COMPETENT TO THE UNDERTAKING AND A MEEK EXULTATION
GLADDENED HER KIND HEART AS SHE FELT HERSELF ABLE TO ANSWER CLEARLY AND
PROMPTLY THE EAGER QUESTIONS PUT BY THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS AS SHE SHOWED
THEM IN HER ANSWERS HOW MUCH AND WHAT SERVICEABLE KNOWLEDGE SHE HAD
ACQUIRED OF THE CONDITION OF HER FELLOW CREATURES AROUND HER
SHIRLEY PLACED AT HER DISPOSAL 300 AND AT SIGHT OF THE MONEY MISS
AINLEY'S EYES FILLED WITH JOYFUL TEARS FOR SHE ALREADY SAW THE HUNGRY
FED THE NAKED CLOTHED THE SICK COMFORTED THEREBY
SHE QUICKLY DREW UP
A SIMPLE SENSIBLE PLAN FOR ITS EXPENDITURE AND SHE ASSURED THEM
BRIGHTER TIMES WOULD NOW COME ROUND FOR SHE DOUBTED NOT THE LADY OF
FIELDHEAD'S EXAMPLE WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY OTHERS
SHE SHOULD TRY TO GET
ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS AND TO FORM A FUND BUT FIRST SHE MUST CONSULT
THE CLERGY
YES ON THAT POINT SHE WAS PEREMPTORY
MR
HELSTONE DR
BOULTBY MR
HALL MUST BE CONSULTED FOR NOT ONLY MUST BRIARFIELD BE
RELIEVED BUT WHINBURY AND NUNNELY
IT WOULD SHE AVERRED BE
PRESUMPTION IN HER TO TAKE A SINGLE STEP UNAUTHORIZED BY THEM
THE CLERGY WERE SACRED BEINGS IN MISS AINLEY'S EYES NO MATTER WHAT
MIGHT BE THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL HIS STATION MADE HIM
HOLY
THE VERY CURATES WHO IN THEIR TRIVIAL ARROGANCE WERE HARDLY
WORTHY TO TIE HER PATTEN STRINGS OR CARRY HER COTTON UMBRELLA OR CHECK
WOOLLEN SHAWL SHE IN HER PURE SINCERE ENTHUSIASM LOOKED UPON AS
SUCKING SAINTS
NO MATTER HOW CLEARLY THEIR LITTLE VICES AND ENORMOUS
ABSURDITIES WERE POINTED OUT TO HER SHE COULD NOT SEE THEM SHE WAS
BLIND TO ECCLESIASTICAL DEFECTS THE WHITE SURPLICE COVERED A MULTITUDE
OF SINS
SHIRLEY KNOWING THIS HARMLESS INFATUATION ON THE PART OF HER
RECENTLY CHOSEN PRIME MINISTER STIPULATED EXPRESSLY THAT THE CURATES
WERE TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THE DISPOSAL OF THE MONEY THAT THEIR MEDDLING
FINGERS WERE NOT TO BE INSERTED INTO THE PIE
THE RECTORS OF COURSE
MUST BE PARAMOUNT AND THEY MIGHT BE TRUSTED
THEY HAD SOME EXPERIENCE
SOME SAGACITY AND MR
HALL AT LEAST HAD SYMPATHY AND LOVING KINDNESS
FOR HIS FELLOW MEN BUT AS FOR THE YOUTH UNDER THEM THEY MUST BE SET
ASIDE KEPT DOWN AND TAUGHT THAT SUBORDINATION AND SILENCE BEST BECAME
THEIR YEARS AND CAPACITY
IT WAS WITH SOME HORROR MISS AINLEY HEARD THIS LANGUAGE
CAROLINE
HOWEVER INTERPOSING WITH A MILD WORD OR TWO IN PRAISE OF MR SWEETING
CALMED HER AGAIN
SWEETING WAS INDEED HER OWN FAVOURITE
SHE
ENDEAVOURED TO RESPECT MESSRS
MALONE AND DONNE BUT THE SLICES OF
SPONGE CAKE AND GLASSES OF COWSLIP OR PRIMROSE WINE SHE HAD AT DIFFERENT
TIMES ADMINISTERED TO SWEETING WHEN HE CAME TO SEE HER IN HER LITTLE
COTTAGE WERE EVER OFFERED WITH SENTIMENTS OF TRULY MOTHERLY REGARD
THE
SAME INNOCUOUS COLLATION SHE HAD ONCE PRESENTED TO MALONE BUT THAT
PERSONAGE EVINCED SUCH OPEN SCORN OF THE OFFERING SHE HAD NEVER
VENTURED TO RENEW IT
TO DONNE SHE ALWAYS SERVED THE TREAT AND WAS
HAPPY TO SEE HIS APPROBATION OF IT PROVED BEYOND A DOUBT BY THE FACT OF
HIS USUALLY EATING TWO PIECES OF CAKE AND PUTTING A THIRD IN HIS
POCKET
INDEFATIGABLE IN HER EXERTIONS WHERE GOOD WAS TO BE DONE MISS AINLEY
WOULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE SET OUT ON A WALK OF TEN MILES ROUND TO THE THREE
RECTORS IN ORDER TO SHOW HER PLAN AND HUMBLY SOLICIT THEIR APPROVAL
BUT MISS KEELDAR INTERDICTED THIS AND PROPOSED AS AN AMENDMENT TO
COLLECT THE CLERGY IN A SMALL SELECT REUNION THAT EVENING AT FIELDHEAD
MISS AINLEY WAS TO MEET THEM AND THE PLAN WAS TO BE DISCUSSED IN FULL
PRIVY COUNCIL
SHIRLEY MANAGED TO GET THE SENIOR PRIESTHOOD TOGETHER ACCORDINGLY AND
BEFORE THE OLD MAID'S ARRIVAL SHE HAD FURTHER TALKED ALL THE
GENTLEMEN INTO THE MOST CHARMING MOOD IMAGINABLE
SHE HERSELF HAD TAKEN
IN HAND DR
BOULTBY AND MR
HELSTONE
THE FIRST WAS A STUBBORN OLD
WELSHMAN HOT OPINIONATED AND OBSTINATE BUT WITHAL A MAN WHO DID A
GREAT DEAL OF GOOD THOUGH NOT WITHOUT MAKING SOME NOISE ABOUT IT
THE
LATTER WE KNOW
SHE HAD RATHER A FRIENDLY FEELING FOR BOTH ESPECIALLY
FOR OLD HELSTONE AND IT COST HER NO TROUBLE TO BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL TO
THEM
SHE TOOK THEM ROUND THE GARDEN SHE GATHERED THEM FLOWERS SHE WAS
LIKE A KIND DAUGHTER TO THEM
MR
HALL SHE LEFT TO CAROLINE OR RATHER
IT WAS TO CAROLINE'S CARE MR
HALL CONSIGNED HIMSELF
HE GENERALLY SOUGHT CAROLINE IN EVERY PARTY WHERE SHE AND HE HAPPENED TO
BE
HE WAS NOT IN GENERAL A LADY'S MAN THOUGH ALL LADIES LIKED HIM
SOMETHING OF A BOOK WORM HE WAS NEAR SIGHTED SPECTACLED NOW AND THEN
ABSTRACTED
TO OLD LADIES HE WAS KIND AS A SON
TO MEN OF EVERY
OCCUPATION AND GRADE HE WAS ACCEPTABLE
THE TRUTH SIMPLICITY FRANKNESS
OF HIS MANNERS THE NOBLENESS OF HIS INTEGRITY THE REALITY AND
ELEVATION OF HIS PIETY WON HIM FRIENDS IN EVERY GRADE
HIS POOR CLERK
AND SEXTON DELIGHTED IN HIM THE NOBLE PATRON OF HIS LIVING ESTEEMED HIM
HIGHLY
IT WAS ONLY WITH YOUNG HANDSOME FASHIONABLE AND STYLISH
LADIES HE FELT A LITTLE SHY
BEING HIMSELF A PLAIN MAN PLAIN IN ASPECT
PLAIN IN MANNERS PLAIN IN SPEECH HE SEEMED TO FEAR THEIR DASH
ELEGANCE AND AIRS
BUT MISS HELSTONE HAD NEITHER DASH NOR AIRS AND HER
NATIVE ELEGANCE WAS OF A VERY QUIET ORDER QUIET AS THE BEAUTY OF A
GROUND LOVING HEDGE FLOWER
HE WAS A FLUENT CHEERFUL AGREEABLE TALKER
CAROLINE COULD TALK TOO IN A TTE TTE
SHE LIKED MR
HALL TO COME
AND TAKE THE SEAT NEXT HER IN A PARTY AND THUS SECURE HER FROM PETER
AUGUSTUS MALONE JOSEPH DONNE OR JOHN SYKES AND MR
HALL NEVER FAILED
TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THIS PRIVILEGE WHEN HE POSSIBLY COULD
SUCH
PREFERENCE SHOWN BY A SINGLE GENTLEMAN TO A SINGLE LADY WOULD CERTAINLY
IN ORDINARY CASES HAVE SET IN MOTION THE TONGUES OF THE GOSSIPS BUT
CYRIL HALL WAS FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD SLIGHTLY BALD AND SLIGHTLY GRAY
AND NOBODY EVER SAID OR THOUGHT HE WAS LIKELY TO BE MARRIED TO MISS
HELSTONE
NOR DID HE THINK SO HIMSELF
HE WAS WEDDED ALREADY TO HIS
BOOKS AND HIS PARISH
HIS KIND SISTER MARGARET SPECTACLED AND LEARNED
LIKE HIMSELF MADE HIM HAPPY IN HIS SINGLE STATE HE CONSIDERED IT TOO
LATE TO CHANGE
BESIDES HE HAD KNOWN CAROLINE AS A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL
SHE HAD SAT ON HIS KNEE MANY A TIME HE HAD BOUGHT HER TOYS AND GIVEN
HER BOOKS HE FELT THAT HER FRIENDSHIP FOR HIM WAS MIXED WITH A SORT OF
FILIAL RESPECT HE COULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT HIMSELF TO ATTEMPT TO GIVE
ANOTHER COLOUR TO HER SENTIMENTS AND HIS SERENE MIND COULD GLASS A FAIR
IMAGE WITHOUT FEELING ITS DEPTHS TROUBLED BY THE REFLECTION
WHEN MISS AINLEY ARRIVED SHE WAS MADE KINDLY WELCOME BY EVERY ONE
MRS
PRYOR AND MARGARET HALL MADE ROOM FOR HER ON THE SOFA BETWEEN THEM AND
WHEN THE THREE WERE SEATED THEY FORMED A TRIO WHICH THE GAY AND
THOUGHTLESS WOULD HAVE SCORNED INDEED AS QUITE WORTHLESS AND
UNATTRACTIVE A MIDDLE AGED WIDOW AND TWO PLAIN SPECTACLED OLD
MAIDS YET WHICH HAD ITS OWN QUIET VALUE AS MANY A SUFFERING AND
FRIENDLESS HUMAN BEING KNEW
SHIRLEY OPENED THE BUSINESS AND SHOWED THE PLAN
I KNOW THE HAND WHICH DREW UP THAT SAID MR
HALL GLANCING AT MISS
AINLEY AND SMILING BENIGNANTLY
HIS APPROBATION WAS WON AT ONCE
BOULTBY HEARD AND DELIBERATED WITH BENT BROW AND PROTRUDED UNDER LIP
HIS CONSENT HE CONSIDERED TOO WEIGHTY TO BE GIVEN IN A HURRY
HELSTONE
GLANCED SHARPLY ROUND WITH AN ALERT SUSPICIOUS EXPRESSION AS IF HE
APPREHENDED THAT FEMALE CRAFT WAS AT WORK AND THAT SOMETHING IN
PETTICOATS WAS SOMEHOW TRYING UNDERHAND TO ACQUIRE TOO MUCH INFLUENCE
AND MAKE ITSELF OF TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE
SHIRLEY CAUGHT AND COMPREHENDED
THE EXPRESSION
THIS SCHEME IS NOTHING SAID SHE CARELESSLY
IT IS
ONLY AN OUTLINE A MERE SUGGESTION
YOU GENTLEMEN ARE REQUESTED TO
DRAW UP RULES OF YOUR OWN
AND SHE DIRECTLY FETCHED HER WRITING CASE SMILING QUEERLY TO HERSELF AS
SHE BENT OVER THE TABLE WHERE IT STOOD
SHE PRODUCED A SHEET OF PAPER A
NEW PEN DREW AN ARM CHAIR TO THE TABLE AND PRESENTING HER HAND TO OLD
HELSTONE BEGGED PERMISSION TO INSTALL HIM IN IT
FOR A MINUTE HE WAS A
LITTLE STIFF AND STOOD WRINKLING HIS COPPER COLOURED FOREHEAD
STRANGELY
AT LAST HE MUTTERED WELL YOU ARE NEITHER MY WIFE NOR MY
DAUGHTER SO I'LL BE LED FOR ONCE BUT MIND I KNOW I AM LED
YOUR
LITTLE FEMALE MANUVRES DON'T BLIND ME
OH SAID SHIRLEY DIPPING THE PEN IN THE INK AND PUTTING IT INTO HIS
HAND YOU MUST REGARD ME AS CAPTAIN KEELDAR TO DAY
THIS IS QUITE A
GENTLEMAN'S AFFAIR YOURS AND MINE ENTIRELY DOCTOR SO SHE HAD DUBBED
THE RECTOR
THE LADIES THERE ARE ONLY TO BE OUR AIDES DE CAMP AND AT
THEIR PERIL THEY SPEAK TILL WE HAVE SETTLED THE WHOLE BUSINESS
HE SMILED A LITTLE GRIMLY AND BEGAN TO WRITE
HE SOON INTERRUPTED
HIMSELF TO ASK QUESTIONS AND CONSULT HIS BRETHREN DISDAINFULLY LIFTING
HIS GLANCE OVER THE CURLY HEADS OF THE TWO GIRLS AND THE DEMURE CAPS OF
THE ELDER LADIES TO MEET THE WINKING GLASSES AND GRAY PATES OF THE
PRIESTS
IN THE DISCUSSION WHICH ENSUED ALL THREE GENTLEMEN TO THEIR
INFINITE CREDIT SHOWED A THOROUGH ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE POOR OF THEIR
PARISHES AN EVEN MINUTE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SEPARATE WANTS
EACH RECTOR
KNEW WHERE CLOTHING WAS NEEDED WHERE FOOD WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE
WHERE MONEY COULD BE BESTOWED WITH A PROBABILITY OF IT BEING JUDICIOUSLY
LAID OUT
WHEREVER THEIR MEMORIES FELL SHORT MISS AINLEY OR MISS HALL
IF APPLIED TO COULD HELP THEM OUT BUT BOTH LADIES TOOK CARE NOT TO
SPEAK UNLESS SPOKEN TO
NEITHER OF THEM WANTED TO BE FOREMOST BUT EACH
SINCERELY DESIRED TO BE USEFUL AND USEFUL THE CLERGY CONSENTED TO MAKE
THEM WITH WHICH BOON THEY WERE CONTENT
SHIRLEY STOOD BEHIND THE RECTORS LEANING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS NOW AND
THEN TO GLANCE AT THE RULES DRAWN UP AND THE LIST OF CASES MAKING OUT
LISTENING TO ALL THEY SAID AND STILL AT INTERVALS SMILING HER QUEER
SMILE A SMILE NOT ILL NATURED BUT SIGNIFICANT TOO SIGNIFICANT TO BE
GENERALLY THOUGHT AMIABLE
MEN RARELY LIKE SUCH OF THEIR FELLOWS AS READ
THEIR INWARD NATURE TOO CLEARLY AND TRULY
IT IS GOOD FOR WOMEN
ESPECIALLY TO BE ENDOWED WITH A SOFT BLINDNESS TO HAVE MILD DIM EYES
THAT NEVER PENETRATE BELOW THE SURFACE OF THINGS THAT TAKE ALL FOR WHAT
IT SEEMS
THOUSANDS KNOWING THIS KEEP THEIR EYELIDS DROOPED ON SYSTEM
BUT THE MOST DOWNCAST GLANCE HAS ITS LOOPHOLE THROUGH WHICH IT CAN ON
OCCASION TAKE ITS SENTINEL SURVEY OF LIFE
I REMEMBER ONCE SEEING A
PAIR OF BLUE EYES THAT WERE USUALLY THOUGHT SLEEPY SECRETLY ON THE
ALERT AND I KNEW BY THEIR EXPRESSION AN EXPRESSION WHICH CHILLED MY
BLOOD IT WAS IN THAT QUARTER SO WONDROUSLY UNEXPECTED THAT FOR YEARS
THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SILENT SOUL READING
THE WORLD CALLED THE
OWNER OF THESE BLUE EYES BONNE PETITE FEMME SHE WAS NOT AN
ENGLISHWOMAN
I LEARNED HER NATURE AFTERWARDS GOT IT OFF BY
HEART STUDIED IT IN ITS FARTHEST MOST HIDDEN RECESSES
SHE WAS THE
FINEST DEEPEST SUBTLEST SCHEMER IN EUROPE
WHEN ALL WAS AT LENGTH SETTLED TO MISS KEELDAR'S MIND AND THE CLERGY
HAD ENTERED SO FULLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF HER PLANS AS TO HEAD THE
SUBSCRIPTION LIST WITH THEIR SIGNATURES FOR 50 EACH SHE ORDERED SUPPER
TO BE SERVED HAVING PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED MRS
GILL TO EXERCISE HER
UTMOST SKILL IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS REPAST
MR
HALL WAS NO BON
VIVANT HE WAS NATURALLY AN ABSTEMIOUS MAN INDIFFERENT TO LUXURY BUT
BOULTBY AND HELSTONE BOTH LIKED GOOD COOKERY
THE RECHERCH SUPPER
CONSEQUENTLY PUT THEM INTO EXCELLENT HUMOUR
THEY DID JUSTICE TO IT
THOUGH IN A GENTLEMANLY WAY NOT IN THE MODE MR
DONNE WOULD HAVE DONE
HAD HE BEEN PRESENT
A GLASS OF FINE WINE WAS LIKEWISE TASTED WITH
DISCERNING THOUGH MOST DECOROUS RELISH
CAPTAIN KEELDAR WAS COMPLIMENTED
ON HIS TASTE THE COMPLIMENT CHARMED HIM
IT HAD BEEN HIS AIM TO GRATIFY
AND SATISFY HIS PRIESTLY GUESTS
HE HAD SUCCEEDED AND WAS RADIANT WITH
GLEE
CHAPTER XV
MR
DONNE'S EXODUS
THE NEXT DAY SHIRLEY EXPRESSED TO CAROLINE HOW DELIGHTED SHE FELT THAT
THE LITTLE PARTY HAD GONE OFF SO WELL
I RATHER LIKE TO ENTERTAIN A CIRCLE OF GENTLEMEN SAID SHE
IT IS
AMUSING TO OBSERVE HOW THEY ENJOY A JUDICIOUSLY CONCOCTED REPAST
FOR
OURSELVES YOU SEE THESE CHOICE WINES AND THESE SCIENTIFIC DISHES ARE
OF NO IMPORTANCE TO US BUT GENTLEMEN SEEM TO RETAIN SOMETHING OF THE
NAVET OF CHILDREN ABOUT FOOD AND ONE LIKES TO PLEASE THEM THAT IS
WHEN THEY SHOW THE BECOMING DECENT SELF GOVERNMENT OF OUR ADMIRABLE
RECTORS
I WATCH MOORE SOMETIMES TO TRY AND DISCOVER HOW HE CAN BE
PLEASED BUT HE HAS NOT THAT CHILD'S SIMPLICITY ABOUT HIM
DID YOU EVER
FIND OUT HIS ACCESSIBLE POINT CAROLINE YOU HAVE SEEN MORE OF HIM THAN
I
IT IS NOT AT ANY RATE THAT OF MY UNCLE AND DR
BOULTBY RETURNED
CAROLINE SMILING
SHE ALWAYS FELT A SORT OF SHY PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING
MISS KEELDAR'S LEAD RESPECTING THE DISCUSSION OF HER COUSIN'S CHARACTER
LEFT TO HERSELF SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE TOUCHED ON THE SUBJECT BUT WHEN
INVITED THE TEMPTATION OF TALKING ABOUT HIM OF WHOM SHE WAS EVER
THINKING WAS IRRESISTIBLE
BUT SHE ADDED I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT IS FOR I NEVER WATCHED ROBERT IN MY LIFE BUT MY SCRUTINY WAS
PRESENTLY BAFFLED BY FINDING HE WAS WATCHING ME
THERE IT IS EXCLAIMED SHIRLEY
YOU CAN'T FIX YOUR EYES ON HIM BUT
HIS PRESENTLY FLASH ON YOU
HE IS NEVER OFF HIS GUARD
HE WON'T GIVE YOU
AN ADVANTAGE
EVEN WHEN HE DOES NOT LOOK AT YOU HIS THOUGHTS SEEM TO BE
BUSY AMONGST YOUR OWN THOUGHTS TRACING YOUR WORDS AND ACTIONS TO THEIR
SOURCE CONTEMPLATING YOUR MOTIVES AT HIS EASE
OH I KNOW THAT SORT OF
CHARACTER OR SOMETHING IN THE SAME STYLE
IT IS ONE THAT PIQUES ME
SINGULARLY
HOW DOES IT AFFECT YOU
THIS QUESTION WAS A SPECIMEN OF ONE OF SHIRLEY'S SHARP SUDDEN TURNS
CAROLINE USED TO BE FLUTTERED BY THEM AT FIRST BUT SHE HAD NOW GOT INTO
THE WAY OF PARRYING THESE HOME THRUSTS LIKE A LITTLE QUAKERESS
PIQUE YOU IN WHAT WAY DOES IT PIQUE YOU SHE SAID
HERE HE COMES SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED SHIRLEY BREAKING OFF STARTING UP
AND RUNNING TO THE WINDOW
HERE COMES A DIVERSION
I NEVER TOLD YOU OF
A SUPERB CONQUEST I HAVE MADE LATELY MADE AT THOSE PARTIES TO WHICH I
CAN NEVER PERSUADE YOU TO ACCOMPANY ME AND THE THING HAS BEEN DONE
WITHOUT EFFORT OR INTENTION ON MY PART THAT I AVER
THERE IS THE
BELL AND BY ALL THAT'S DELICIOUS THERE ARE TWO OF THEM
DO THEY NEVER
HUNT THEN EXCEPT IN COUPLES YOU MAY HAVE ONE LINA AND YOU MAY TAKE
YOUR CHOICE
I HOPE I AM GENEROUS ENOUGH
LISTEN TO TARTAR
THE BLACK MUZZLED TAWNY DOG A GLIMPSE OF WHICH WAS SEEN IN THE CHAPTER
WHICH FIRST INTRODUCED ITS MISTRESS TO THE READER HERE GAVE TONGUE IN
THE HALL AMIDST WHOSE HOLLOW SPACE THE DEEP BARK RESOUNDED FORMIDABLY
A GROWL MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE BARK MENACING AS MUTTERED THUNDER
SUCCEEDED
LISTEN AGAIN CRIED SHIRLEY LAUGHING
YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE
PRELUDE TO A BLOODY ONSLAUGHT
THEY WILL BE FRIGHTENED
THEY DON'T KNOW
OLD TARTAR AS I DO
THEY ARE NOT AWARE HIS UPROARS ARE ALL SOUND AND
FURY SIGNIFYING NOTHING
SOME BUSTLE WAS HEARD
DOWN SIR DOWN EXCLAIMED A HIGH TONED
IMPERIOUS VOICE AND THEN CAME A CRACK OF A CANE OR WHIP
IMMEDIATELY
THERE WAS A YELL A SCUTTER A RUN A POSITIVE TUMULT
O MALONE MALONE
DOWN DOWN DOWN CRIED THE HIGH VOICE
HE REALLY IS WORRYING THEM EXCLAIMED SHIRLEY
THEY HAVE STRUCK HIM
A BLOW IS WHAT HE IS NOT USED TO AND WILL NOT TAKE
OUT SHE RAN
A GENTLEMAN WAS FLEEING UP THE OAK STAIRCASE MAKING FOR
REFUGE IN THE GALLERY OR CHAMBERS IN HOT HASTE ANOTHER WAS BACKING FAST
TO THE STAIRFOOT WILDLY FLOURISHING A KNOTTY STICK AT THE SAME TIME
REITERATING DOWN DOWN DOWN WHILE THE TAWNY DOG BAYED BELLOWED
HOWLED AT HIM AND A GROUP OF SERVANTS CAME BUNDLING FROM THE KITCHEN
THE DOG MADE A SPRING THE SECOND GENTLEMAN TURNED TAIL AND RUSHED AFTER
HIS COMRADE
THE FIRST WAS ALREADY SAFE IN A BEDROOM HE HELD THE DOOR
AGAINST HIS FELLOW NOTHING SO MERCILESS AS TERROR
BUT THE OTHER
FUGITIVE STRUGGLED HARD THE DOOR WAS ABOUT TO YIELD TO HIS STRENGTH
GENTLEMEN WAS UTTERED IN MISS KEELDAR'S SILVERY BUT VIBRATING TONES
SPARE MY LOCKS IF YOU PLEASE
CALM YOURSELVES COME DOWN LOOK AT
TARTAR HE WON'T HARM A CAT
SHE WAS CARESSING THE SAID TARTAR
HE LAY CROUCHED AT HER FEET HIS FORE
PAWS STRETCHED OUT HIS TAIL STILL IN THREATENING AGITATION HIS
NOSTRILS SNORTING HIS BULLDOG EYES CONSCIOUS OF A DULL FIRE
HE WAS AN
HONEST PHLEGMATIC STUPID BUT STUBBORN CANINE CHARACTER
HE LOVED HIS
MISTRESS AND JOHN THE MAN WHO FED HIM BUT WAS MOSTLY INDIFFERENT TO
THE REST OF THE WORLD
QUIET ENOUGH HE WAS UNLESS STRUCK OR THREATENED
WITH A STICK AND THAT PUT A DEMON INTO HIM AT ONCE
MR
MALONE HOW DO YOU DO CONTINUED SHIRLEY LIFTING UP HER MIRTH LIT
FACE TO THE GALLERY
THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO THE OAK PARLOUR THAT IS
MRS
PRYOR'S APARTMENT
REQUEST YOUR FRIEND MR
DONNE TO EVACUATE
I
SHALL HAVE THE GREATEST PLEASURE IN RECEIVING HIM IN A LOWER ROOM
HA HA CRIED MALONE IN HOLLOW LAUGHTER QUITTING THE DOOR AND
LEANING OVER THE MASSIVE BALUSTRADE
REALLY THAT ANIMAL ALARMED DONNE
HE IS A LITTLE TIMID HE PROCEEDED STIFFENING HIMSELF AND WALKING
TRIMLY TO THE STAIRHEAD
I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO FOLLOW IN ORDER TO
REASSURE HIM
IT APPEARS YOU DID
WELL COME DOWN IF YOU PLEASE JOHN TURNING TO
HER MANSERVANT GO UPSTAIRS AND LIBERATE MR
DONNE TAKE CARE MR
MALONE THE STAIRS ARE SLIPPERY
IN TRUTH THEY WERE BEING OF POLISHED OAK
THE CAUTION CAME A LITTLE
LATE FOR MALONE
HE HAD SLIPPED ALREADY IN HIS STATELY DESCENT AND WAS
ONLY SAVED FROM FALLING BY A CLUTCH AT THE BANISTERS WHICH MADE THE
WHOLE STRUCTURE CREAK AGAIN
TARTAR SEEMED TO THINK THE VISITOR'S DESCENT EFFECTED WITH UNWARRANTED
CLAT AND ACCORDINGLY HE GROWLED ONCE MORE
MALONE HOWEVER WAS NO
COWARD
THE SPRING OF THE DOG HAD TAKEN HIM BY SURPRISE BUT HE PASSED
HIM NOW IN SUPPRESSED FURY RATHER THAN FEAR
IF A LOOK COULD HAVE
STRANGLED TARTAR HE WOULD HAVE BREATHED NO MORE
FORGETTING POLITENESS
IN HIS SULLEN RAGE MALONE PUSHED INTO THE PARLOUR BEFORE MISS KEELDAR
HE GLANCED AT MISS HELSTONE HE COULD SCARCELY BRING HIMSELF TO BEND TO
HER
HE GLARED ON BOTH THE LADIES
HE LOOKED AS IF HAD EITHER OF THEM
BEEN HIS WIFE HE WOULD HAVE MADE A GLORIOUS HUSBAND AT THE MOMENT
IN
EACH HAND HE SEEMED AS IF HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO CLUTCH ONE AND GRIPE
HER TO DEATH
HOWEVER SHIRLEY TOOK PITY
SHE CEASED TO LAUGH AND CAROLINE WAS TOO
TRUE A LADY TO SMILE EVEN AT ANY ONE UNDER MORTIFICATION
TARTAR WAS
DISMISSED PETER AUGUSTUS WAS SOOTHED FOR SHIRLEY HAD LOOKS AND TONES
THAT MIGHT SOOTHE A VERY BULL
HE HAD SENSE TO FEEL THAT SINCE HE COULD
NOT CHALLENGE THE OWNER OF THE DOG HE HAD BETTER BE CIVIL
AND CIVIL HE
TRIED TO BE AND HIS ATTEMPTS BEING WELL RECEIVED HE GREW PRESENTLY
VERY CIVIL AND QUITE HIMSELF AGAIN
HE HAD COME INDEED FOR THE
EXPRESS PURPOSE OF MAKING HIMSELF CHARMING AND FASCINATING
ROUGH
PORTENTS HAD MET HIM ON HIS FIRST ADMISSION TO FIELDHEAD BUT THAT
PASSAGE GOT OVER CHARMING AND FASCINATING HE RESOLVED TO BE
LIKE
MARCH HAVING COME IN LIKE A LION HE PURPOSED TO GO OUT LIKE A LAMB
FOR THE SAKE OF AIR AS IT APPEARED OR PERHAPS FOR THAT OF READY EXIT
IN CASE OF SOME NEW EMERGENCY ARISING HE TOOK HIS SEAT NOT ON THE
SOFA WHERE MISS KEELDAR OFFERED HIM ENTHRONIZATION NOR YET NEAR THE
FIRESIDE TO WHICH CAROLINE BY A FRIENDLY SIGN GENTLY INVITED HIM BUT
ON A CHAIR CLOSE TO THE DOOR
BEING NO LONGER SULLEN OR FURIOUS HE
GREW AFTER HIS FASHION CONSTRAINED AND EMBARRASSED
HE TALKED TO THE
LADIES BY FITS AND STARTS CHOOSING FOR TOPICS WHATEVER WAS MOST
INTENSELY COMMONPLACE
HE SIGHED DEEPLY SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE CLOSE OF
EVERY SENTENCE HE SIGHED IN EACH PAUSE HE SIGHED ERE HE OPENED HIS
MOUTH
AT LAST FINDING IT DESIRABLE TO ADD EASE TO HIS OTHER CHARMS HE
DREW FORTH TO AID HIM AN AMPLE SILK POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
THIS WAS TO BE
THE GRACEFUL TOY WITH WHICH HIS UNOCCUPIED HANDS WERE TO TRIFLE
HE WENT
TO WORK WITH A CERTAIN ENERGY
HE FOLDED THE RED AND YELLOW SQUARE
CORNERWISE HE WHIPPED IT OPEN WITH A WAFT AGAIN HE FOLDED IT IN
NARROWER COMPASS HE MADE OF IT A HANDSOME BAND
TO WHAT PURPOSE WOULD
HE PROCEED TO APPLY THE LIGATURE WOULD HE WRAP IT ABOUT HIS THROAT HIS
HEAD SHOULD IT BE A COMFORTER OR A TURBAN NEITHER
PETER AUGUSTUS HAD
AN INVENTIVE AN ORIGINAL GENIUS
HE WAS ABOUT TO SHOW THE LADIES GRACES
OF ACTION POSSESSING AT LEAST THE CHARM OF NOVELTY
HE SAT ON THE CHAIR
WITH HIS ATHLETIC IRISH LEGS CROSSED AND THESE LEGS IN THAT ATTITUDE
HE CIRCLED WITH THE BANDANA AND BOUND FIRMLY TOGETHER
IT WAS EVIDENT
HE FELT THIS DEVICE TO BE WORTH AN ENCORE HE REPEATED IT MORE THAN
ONCE
THE SECOND PERFORMANCE SENT SHIRLEY TO THE WINDOW TO LAUGH HER
SILENT BUT IRREPRESSIBLE LAUGH UNSEEN IT TURNED CAROLINE'S HEAD ASIDE
THAT HER LONG CURLS MIGHT SCREEN THE SMILE MANTLING ON HER FEATURES
MISS HELSTONE INDEED WAS AMUSED BY MORE THAN ONE POINT IN PETER'S
DEMEANOUR
SHE WAS EDIFIED AT THE COMPLETE THOUGH ABRUPT DIVERSION OF
HIS HOMAGE FROM HERSELF TO THE HEIRESS
THE 5 000 HE SUPPOSED HER
LIKELY ONE DAY TO INHERIT WERE NOT TO BE WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE AGAINST
MISS KEELDAR'S ESTATE AND HALL
HE TOOK NO PAINS TO CONCEAL HIS
CALCULATIONS AND TACTICS
HE PRETENDED TO NO GRADUAL CHANGE OF VIEWS HE
WHEELED ABOUT AT ONCE
THE PURSUIT OF THE LESSER FORTUNE WAS OPENLY
RELINQUISHED FOR THAT OF THE GREATER
ON WHAT GROUNDS HE EXPECTED TO
SUCCEED IN HIS CHASE HIMSELF BEST KNEW CERTAINLY NOT BY SKILFUL
MANAGEMENT
FROM THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT ELAPSED IT APPEARED THAT JOHN HAD SOME
DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING MR
DONNE TO DESCEND
AT LENGTH HOWEVER THAT
GENTLEMAN APPEARED NOR AS HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE OAK PARLOUR
DOOR DID HE SEEM IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE ASHAMED OR CONFUSED NOT A
WHIT
DONNE INDEED WAS OF THAT COLDLY PHLEGMATIC IMMOVABLY
COMPLACENT DENSELY SELF SATISFIED NATURE WHICH IS INSENSIBLE TO SHAME
HE HAD NEVER BLUSHED IN HIS LIFE NO HUMILIATION COULD ABASH HIM HIS
NERVES WERE NOT CAPABLE OF SENSATION ENOUGH TO STIR HIS LIFE AND MAKE
COLOUR MOUNT TO HIS CHEEK HE HAD NO FIRE IN HIS BLOOD AND NO MODESTY IN
HIS SOUL HE WAS A FRONTLESS ARROGANT DECOROUS SLIP OF THE
COMMONPLACE CONCEITED INANE INSIPID AND THIS GENTLEMAN HAD A NOTION
OF WOOING MISS KEELDAR HE KNEW NO MORE HOWEVER HOW TO SET ABOUT THE
BUSINESS THAN IF HE HAD BEEN AN IMAGE CARVED IN WOOD
HE HAD NO IDEA OF
A TASTE TO BE PLEASED A HEART TO BE REACHED IN COURTSHIP
HIS NOTION
WAS WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE FORMALLY VISITED HER A FEW TIMES TO WRITE A
LETTER PROPOSING MARRIAGE
THEN HE CALCULATED SHE WOULD ACCEPT HIM FOR
LOVE OF HIS OFFICE THEN THEY WOULD BE MARRIED THEN HE SHOULD BE MASTER
OF FIELDHEAD AND HE SHOULD LIVE VERY COMFORTABLY HAVE SERVANTS AT HIS
COMMAND EAT AND DRINK OF THE BEST AND BE A GREAT MAN
YOU WOULD NOT
HAVE SUSPECTED HIS INTENTIONS WHEN HE ADDRESSED HIS INTENDED BRIDE IN AN
IMPERTINENT INJURED TONE A VERY DANGEROUS DOG THAT MISS KEELDAR
I
WONDER YOU SHOULD KEEP SUCH AN ANIMAL
DO YOU MR
DONNE PERHAPS YOU WILL WONDER MORE WHEN I TELL YOU I AM
VERY FOND OF HIM
I SHOULD SAY YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS IN THE ASSERTION
CAN'T FANCY A LADY
FOND OF THAT BRUTE 'TIS SO UGLY A MERE CARTER'S DOG
PRAY HANG HIM
HANG WHAT I AM FOND OF
AND PURCHASE IN HIS STEAD SOME SWEETLY POOTY PUG OR POODLE SOMETHING
APPROPRIATE TO THE FAIR SEX
LADIES GENERALLY LIKE LAP DOGS
PERHAPS I AM AN EXCEPTION
OH YOU CAN'T BE YOU KNOW
ALL LADIES ARE ALIKE IN THOSE MATTERS
THAT
IS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED
TARTAR FRIGHTENED YOU TERRIBLY MR
DONNE
I HOPE YOU WON'T TAKE ANY
HARM
THAT I SHALL NO DOUBT
HE GAVE ME A TURN I SHALL NOT SOON FORGET
WHEN
I SOR HIM SUCH WAS MR
DONNE'S PRONUNCIATION ABOUT TO SPRING I
THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE FAINTED
PERHAPS YOU DID FAINT IN THE BEDROOM YOU WERE A LONG TIME THERE
NO I BORE UP THAT I MIGHT HOLD THE DOOR FAST
I WAS DETERMINED NOT TO
LET ANY ONE ENTER
I THOUGHT I WOULD KEEP A BARRIER BETWEEN ME AND THE
ENEMY
BUT WHAT IF YOUR FRIEND MR
MALONE HAD BEEN WORRIED
MALONE MUST TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF
YOUR MAN PERSUADED ME TO COME OUT AT
LAST BY SAYING THE DOG WAS CHAINED UP IN HIS KENNEL
IF I HAD NOT BEEN
ASSURED OF THIS I WOULD HAVE REMAINED ALL DAY IN THE CHAMBER
BUT WHAT
IS THAT I DECLARE THE MAN HAS TOLD A FALSEHOOD THE DOG IS THERE
AND INDEED TARTAR WALKED PAST THE GLASS DOOR OPENING TO THE GARDEN
STIFF TAWNY AND BLACK MUZZLED AS EVER
HE STILL SEEMED IN BAD HUMOUR
HE WAS GROWLING AGAIN AND WHISTLING A HALF STRANGLED WHISTLE BEING AN
INHERITANCE FROM THE BULLDOG SIDE OF HIS ANCESTRY
THERE ARE OTHER VISITORS COMING OBSERVED SHIRLEY WITH THAT PROVOKING
COOLNESS WHICH THE OWNERS OF FORMIDABLE LOOKING DOGS ARE APT TO SHOW
WHILE THEIR ANIMALS ARE ALL BRISTLE AND BAY
TARTAR SPRANG DOWN THE
PAVEMENT TOWARDS THE GATE BELLOWING AVEC EXPLOSION
HIS MISTRESS
QUIETLY OPENED THE GLASS DOOR AND STEPPED OUT CHIRRUPING TO HIM
HIS
BELLOW WAS ALREADY SILENCED AND HE WAS LIFTING UP HIS HUGE BLUNT
STUPID HEAD TO THE NEW CALLERS TO BE PATTED
WHAT TARTAR TARTAR SAID A CHEERY RATHER BOYISH VOICE DON'T YOU
KNOW US GOOD MORNING OLD BOY
AND LITTLE MR
SWEETING WHOSE CONSCIOUS GOOD NATURE MADE HIM
COMPARATIVELY FEARLESS OF MAN WOMAN CHILD OR BRUTE CAME THROUGH THE
GATE CARESSING THE GUARDIAN
HIS VICAR MR
HALL FOLLOWED
HE HAD NO
FEAR OF TARTAR EITHER AND TARTAR HAD NO ILL WILL TO HIM
HE SNUFFED
BOTH THE GENTLEMEN ROUND AND THEN AS IF CONCLUDING THAT THEY WERE
HARMLESS AND MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO PASS HE WITHDREW TO THE SUNNY FRONT
OF THE HALL LEAVING THE ARCHWAY FREE
MR
SWEETING FOLLOWED AND WOULD
HAVE PLAYED WITH HIM BUT TARTAR TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIS CARESSES
IT WAS
ONLY HIS MISTRESS'S HAND WHOSE TOUCH GAVE HIM PLEASURE TO ALL OTHERS HE
SHOWED HIMSELF OBSTINATELY INSENSIBLE
SHIRLEY ADVANCED TO MEET MESSRS
HALL AND SWEETING SHAKING HANDS WITH
THEM CORDIALLY
THEY WERE COME TO TELL HER OF CERTAIN SUCCESSES THEY HAD
ACHIEVED THAT MORNING IN APPLICATIONS FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE FUND
MR
HALL'S EYES BEAMED BENIGNANTLY THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES HIS PLAIN FACE
LOOKED POSITIVELY HANDSOME WITH GOODNESS AND WHEN CAROLINE SEEING WHO
WAS COME RAN OUT TO MEET HIM AND PUT BOTH HER HANDS INTO HIS HE GAZED
DOWN ON HER WITH A GENTLE SERENE AFFECTIONATE EXPRESSION THAT GAVE HIM
THE ASPECT OF A SMILING MELANCHTHON
INSTEAD OF RE ENTERING THE HOUSE THEY STRAYED THROUGH THE GARDEN THE
LADIES WALKING ONE ON EACH SIDE OF MR
HALL
IT WAS A BREEZY SUNNY DAY
THE AIR FRESHENED THE GIRLS' CHEEKS AND GRACEFULLY DISHEVELLED THEIR
RINGLETS
BOTH OF THEM LOOKED PRETTY ONE GAY
MR
HALL SPOKE OFTENEST
TO HIS BRILLIANT COMPANION LOOKED MOST FREQUENTLY AT THE QUIET ONE
MISS KEELDAR GATHERED HANDFULS OF THE PROFUSELY BLOOMING FLOWERS WHOSE
PERFUME FILLED THE ENCLOSURE
SHE GAVE SOME TO CAROLINE TELLING HER TO
CHOOSE A NOSEGAY FOR MR
HALL AND WITH HER LAP FILLED WITH DELICATE AND
SPLENDID BLOSSOMS CAROLINE SAT DOWN ON THE STEPS OF A SUMMER HOUSE
THE
VICAR STOOD NEAR HER LEANING ON HIS CANE
SHIRLEY WHO COULD NOT BE INHOSPITABLE NOW CALLED OUT THE NEGLECTED
PAIR IN THE OAK PARLOUR
SHE CONVOYED DONNE PAST HIS DREAD ENEMY TARTAR
WHO WITH HIS NOSE ON HIS FORE PAWS LAY SNORING UNDER THE MERIDIAN SUN
DONNE WAS NOT GRATEFUL HE NEVER WAS GRATEFUL FOR KINDNESS AND
ATTENTION BUT HE WAS GLAD OF THE SAFEGUARD
MISS KEELDAR DESIROUS OF
BEING IMPARTIAL OFFERED THE CURATES FLOWERS
THEY ACCEPTED THEM WITH
NATIVE AWKWARDNESS
MALONE SEEMED SPECIALLY AT A LOSS WHEN A BOUQUET
FILLED ONE HAND WHILE HIS SHILLELAH OCCUPIED THE OTHER
DONNE'S THANK
YOU WAS RICH TO HEAR
IT WAS THE MOST FATUOUS AND ARROGANT OF SOUNDS
IMPLYING THAT HE CONSIDERED THIS OFFERING A HOMAGE TO HIS MERITS AND AN
ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE HEIRESS TO INGRATIATE HERSELF INTO HIS
PRICELESS AFFECTIONS
SWEETING ALONE RECEIVED THE POSY LIKE A SMART
SENSIBLE LITTLE MAN AS HE WAS PUTTING IT GALLANTLY AND NATTILY INTO
HIS BUTTONHOLE
AS A REWARD FOR HIS GOOD MANNERS MISS KEELDAR BECKONING HIM APART
GAVE HIM SOME COMMISSION WHICH MADE HIS EYES SPARKLE WITH GLEE
AWAY HE
FLEW ROUND BY THE COURTYARD TO THE KITCHEN
NO NEED TO GIVE HIM
DIRECTIONS HE WAS ALWAYS AT HOME EVERYWHERE
ERE LONG HE REAPPEARED
CARRYING A ROUND TABLE WHICH HE PLACED UNDER THE CEDAR THEN HE
COLLECTED SIX GARDEN CHAIRS FROM VARIOUS NOOKS AND BOWERS IN THE
GROUNDS AND PLACED THEM IN A CIRCLE
THE PARLOUR MAID MISS KEELDAR
KEPT NO FOOTMAN CAME OUT BEARING A NAPKIN COVERED TRAY
SWEETING'S
NIMBLE FINGERS AIDED IN DISPOSING GLASSES PLATES KNIVES AND FORKS HE
ASSISTED HER TOO IN SETTING FORTH A NEAT LUNCHEON CONSISTING OF COLD
CHICKEN HAM AND TARTS
THIS SORT OF IMPROMPTU REGALE IT WAS SHIRLEY'S DELIGHT TO OFFER ANY
CHANCE GUESTS AND NOTHING PLEASED HER BETTER THAN TO HAVE AN ALERT
OBLIGING LITTLE FRIEND LIKE SWEETING TO RUN ABOUT HER HAND CHEERILY
RECEIVE AND BRISKLY EXECUTE HER HOSPITABLE HINTS
DAVID AND SHE WERE ON
THE BEST TERMS IN THE WORLD AND HIS DEVOTION TO THE HEIRESS WAS QUITE
DISINTERESTED SINCE IT PREJUDICED IN NOTHING HIS FAITHFUL ALLEGIANCE TO
THE MAGNIFICENT DORA SYKES
THE REPAST TURNED OUT A VERY MERRY ONE
DONNE AND MALONE INDEED
CONTRIBUTED BUT LITTLE TO ITS VIVACITY THE CHIEF PART THEY PLAYED IN IT
BEING WHAT CONCERNED THE KNIFE FORK AND WINE GLASS BUT WHERE FOUR
SUCH NATURES AS MR
HALL DAVID SWEETING SHIRLEY AND CAROLINE WERE
ASSEMBLED IN HEALTH AND AMITY ON A GREEN LAWN UNDER A SUNNY SKY
AMIDST A WILDERNESS OF FLOWERS THERE COULD NOT BE UNGENIAL DULLNESS
IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION MR
HALL REMINDED THE LADIES THAT
WHITSUNTIDE WAS APPROACHING WHEN THE GRAND UNITED SUNDAY SCHOOL
TEA DRINKING AND PROCESSION OF THE THREE PARISHES OF BRIARFIELD
WHINBURY AND NUNNELY WERE TO TAKE PLACE
CAROLINE HE KNEW WOULD BE AT
HER POST AS TEACHER HE SAID AND HE HOPED MISS KEELDAR WOULD NOT BE
WANTING
HE HOPED SHE WOULD MAKE HER FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE AMONGST
THEM AT THAT TIME
SHIRLEY WAS NOT THE PERSON TO MISS AN OCCASION OF
THIS SORT
SHE LIKED FESTIVE EXCITEMENT A GATHERING OF HAPPINESS A
CONCENTRATION AND COMBINATION OF PLEASANT DETAILS A THRONG OF GLAD
FACES A MUSTER OF ELATED HEARTS
SHE TOLD MR
HALL THEY MIGHT COUNT ON
HER WITH SECURITY
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO DO BUT THEY
MIGHT DISPOSE OF HER AS THEY PLEASED
AND SAID CAROLINE YOU WILL PROMISE TO COME TO MY TABLE AND TO SIT
NEAR ME MR
HALL
I SHALL NOT FAIL DEO VOLENTE SAID HE I HAVE OCCUPIED THE PLACE
ON HER RIGHT HAND AT THESE MONSTER TEA DRINKINGS FOR THE LAST SIX
YEARS HE PROCEEDED TURNING TO MISS KEELDAR
THEY MADE HER A
SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL OF TWELVE
SHE IS NOT
PARTICULARLY SELF CONFIDENT BY NATURE AS YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED AND THE
FIRST TIME SHE HAD TO 'TAKE A TRAY AS THE PHRASE IS AND MAKE TEA IN
PUBLIC THERE WAS SOME PITEOUS TREMBLING AND FLUSHING
I OBSERVED THE
SPEECHLESS PANIC THE CUPS SHAKING IN THE LITTLE HAND AND THE
OVERFLOWING TEAPOT FILLED TOO FULL FROM THE URN
I CAME TO HER AID TOOK
A SEAT NEAR HER MANAGED THE URN AND THE SLOP BASIN AND IN FACT MADE
THE TEA FOR HER LIKE ANY OLD WOMAN
I WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU INTERPOSED CAROLINE
YOU WERE
YOU TOLD ME SO WITH AN EARNEST SINCERITY THAT REPAID ME WELL
INASMUCH AS IT WAS NOT LIKE THE MAJORITY OF LITTLE LADIES OF TWELVE
WHOM YOU MAY HELP AND CARESS FOR EVER WITHOUT THEIR EVINCING ANY QUICKER
SENSE OF THE KINDNESS DONE AND MEANT THAN IF THEY WERE MADE OF WAX AND
WOOD INSTEAD OF FLESH AND NERVES SHE KEPT CLOSE TO ME MISS KEELDAR
THE REST OF THE EVENING WALKING WITH ME OVER THE GROUNDS WHERE THE
CHILDREN WERE PLAYING SHE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE VESTRY WHEN ALL WERE
SUMMONED INTO CHURCH SHE WOULD I BELIEVE HAVE MOUNTED WITH ME TO THE
PULPIT HAD I NOT TAKEN THE PREVIOUS PRECAUTION OF CONDUCTING HER TO THE
RECTORY PEW
AND HE HAS BEEN MY FRIEND EVER SINCE SAID CAROLINE
AND ALWAYS SAT AT HER TABLE NEAR HER TRAY AND HANDED THE CUPS THAT
IS THE EXTENT OF MY SERVICES
THE NEXT THING I DO FOR HER WILL BE TO
MARRY HER SOME DAY TO SOME CURATE OR MILL OWNER BUT MIND CAROLINE I
SHALL INQUIRE ABOUT THE BRIDEGROOM'S CHARACTER AND IF HE IS NOT A
GENTLEMAN LIKELY TO RENDER HAPPY THE LITTLE GIRL WHO WALKED WITH ME
HAND IN HAND OVER NUNNELY COMMON I WILL NOT OFFICIATE
SO TAKE CARE
THE CAUTION IS USELESS
I AM NOT GOING TO BE MARRIED
I SHALL LIVE
SINGLE LIKE YOUR SISTER MARGARET MR
HALL
VERY WELL
YOU MIGHT DO WORSE
MARGARET IS NOT UNHAPPY
SHE HAS HER
BOOKS FOR A PLEASURE AND HER BROTHER FOR A CARE AND IS CONTENT
IF
EVER YOU WANT A HOME IF THE DAY SHOULD COME WHEN BRIARFIELD RECTORY IS
YOURS NO LONGER COME TO NUNNELY VICARAGE
SHOULD THE OLD MAID AND
BACHELOR BE STILL LIVING THEY WILL MAKE YOU TENDERLY WELCOME
THERE ARE YOUR FLOWERS
NOW SAID CAROLINE WHO HAD KEPT THE NOSEGAY
SHE HAD SELECTED FOR HIM TILL THIS MOMENT YOU DON'T CARE FOR A
BOUQUET BUT YOU MUST GIVE IT TO MARGARET ONLY TO BE SENTIMENTAL FOR
ONCE KEEP THAT LITTLE FORGET ME NOT WHICH IS A WILD FLOWER I GATHERED
FROM THE GRASS AND TO BE STILL MORE SENTIMENTAL LET ME TAKE TWO OR
THREE OF THE BLUE BLOSSOMS AND PUT THEM IN MY SOUVENIR
AND SHE TOOK OUT A SMALL BOOK WITH ENAMELLED COVER AND SILVER CLASP
WHEREIN HAVING OPENED IT SHE INSERTED THE FLOWERS WRITING ROUND THEM
IN PENCIL TO BE KEPT FOR THE SAKE OF THE REV
CYRIL HALL MY FRIEND
MAY 18
THE REV
CYRIL HALL ON HIS PART ALSO PLACED A SPRIG IN SAFETY BETWEEN
THE LEAVES OF A POCKET TESTAMENT
HE ONLY WROTE ON THE MARGIN
CAROLINE
NOW SAID HE SMILING I TRUST WE ARE ROMANTIC ENOUGH
MISS KEELDAR
HE CONTINUED THE CURATES BY THE BYE DURING THIS CONVERSATION WERE
TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THEIR OWN JOKES TO NOTICE WHAT PASSED AT THE
OTHER END OF THE TABLE I HOPE YOU ARE LAUGHING AT THIS TRAIT OF EXALTATION IN THE OLD GRAY HEADED VICAR BUT THE FACT IS I AM SO
USED TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUESTS OF THIS YOUNG FRIEND OF YOURS I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO REFUSE HER WHEN SHE TELLS ME TO DO ANYTHING
YOU WOULD SAY
IT IS NOT MUCH IN MY WAY TO TRAFFIC WITH FLOWERS AND FORGET ME NOTS
BUT YOU SEE WHEN REQUESTED TO BE SENTIMENTAL I AM OBEDIENT
HE IS NATURALLY RATHER SENTIMENTAL REMARKED CAROLINE
MARGARET TOLD
ME SO AND I KNOW WHAT PLEASES HIM
THAT YOU SHOULD BE GOOD AND HAPPY YES THAT IS ONE OF MY GREATEST
PLEASURES
MAY GOD LONG PRESERVE TO YOU THE BLESSINGS OF PEACE AND
INNOCENCE BY WHICH PHRASE I MEAN COMPARATIVE INNOCENCE FOR IN HIS
SIGHT I AM WELL AWARE NONE ARE PURE
WHAT TO OUR HUMAN PERCEPTIONS
LOOKS SPOTLESS AS WE FANCY ANGELS IS TO HIM BUT FRAILTY NEEDING THE
BLOOD OF HIS SON TO CLEANSE AND THE STRENGTH OF HIS SPIRIT TO SUSTAIN
LET US EACH AND ALL CHERISH HUMILITY I AS YOU MY YOUNG FRIENDS AND
WE MAY WELL DO IT WHEN WE LOOK INTO OUR OWN HEARTS AND SEE THERE
TEMPTATIONS INCONSISTENCIES PROPENSITIES EVEN WE BLUSH TO RECOGNIZE
AND IT IS NOT YOUTH NOR GOOD LOOKS NOR GRACE NOR ANY GENTLE OUTSIDE
CHARM WHICH MAKES EITHER BEAUTY OR GOODNESS IN GOD'S EYES YOUNG
LADIES WHEN YOUR MIRROR OR MEN'S TONGUES FLATTER YOU REMEMBER THAT IN
THE SIGHT OF HER MAKER MARY ANN AINLEY A WOMAN WHOM NEITHER GLASS NOR
LIPS HAVE EVER PANEGYRIZED IS FAIRER AND BETTER THAN EITHER OF YOU
SHE
IS INDEED HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE SHE IS INDEED
YOU YOUNG THINGS
WRAPT UP IN YOURSELVES AND IN EARTHLY HOPES SCARCELY LIVE AS CHRIST
LIVED
PERHAPS YOU CANNOT DO IT YET WHILE EXISTENCE IS SO SWEET AND
EARTH SO SMILING TO YOU IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT
SHE WITH MEEK
HEART AND DUE REVERENCE TREADS CLOSE IN HER REDEEMER'S STEPS
HERE THE HARSH VOICE OF DONNE BROKE IN ON THE MILD TONES OF MR
HALL
AHEM HE BEGAN CLEARING HIS THROAT EVIDENTLY FOR A SPEECH OF SOME
IMPORTANCE AHEM MISS KEELDAR YOUR ATTENTION AN INSTANT IF YOU
PLEASE
WELL SAID SHIRLEY NONCHALANTLY WHAT IS IT I LISTEN
ALL OF ME IS
EAR THAT IS NOT EYE
I HOPE PART OF YOU IS HAND ALSO RETURNED DONNE IN HIS VULGARLY
PRESUMPTUOUS AND FAMILIAR STYLE AND PART PURSE
IT IS TO THE HAND AND
PURSE I PROPOSE TO APPEAL
I CAME HERE THIS MORNING WITH A VIEW TO BEG
OF YOU
YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE TO MRS
GILL SHE IS MY ALMONER
TO BEG OF YOU A SUBSCRIPTION TO A SCHOOL
I AND DR
BOULTBY INTEND TO
ERECT ONE IN THE HAMLET OF ECCLEFIGG WHICH IS UNDER OUR VICARAGE OF
WHINBURY
THE BAPTISTS HAVE GOT POSSESSION OF IT
THEY HAVE A CHAPEL
THERE AND WE WANT TO DISPUTE THE GROUND
BUT I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ECCLEFIGG
I POSSESS NO PROPERTY THERE
WHAT DOES THAT SIGNIFY YOU'RE A CHURCHWOMAN AIN'T YOU
ADMIRABLE CREATURE MUTTERED SHIRLEY UNDER HER BREATH
EXQUISITE
ADDRESS FINE STYLE WHAT RAPTURES HE EXCITES IN ME THEN ALOUD I AM
A CHURCHWOMAN CERTAINLY
THEN YOU CAN'T REFUSE TO CONTRIBUTE IN THIS CASE
THE POPULATION OF
ECCLEFIGG ARE A PARCEL OF BRUTES WE WANT TO CIVILIZE THEM
WHO IS TO BE THE MISSIONARY
MYSELF PROBABLY
YOU WON'T FAIL THROUGH LACK OF SYMPATHY WITH YOUR FLOCK
I HOPE NOT I EXPECT SUCCESS BUT WE MUST HAVE MONEY
THERE IS THE
PAPER
PRAY GIVE A HANDSOME SUM
WHEN ASKED FOR MONEY SHIRLEY RARELY HELD BACK
SHE PUT DOWN HER NAME
FOR 5
AFTER THE 300 SHE HAD LATELY GIVEN AND THE MANY SMALLER SUMS
SHE WAS GIVING CONSTANTLY IT WAS AS MUCH AS SHE COULD AT PRESENT
AFFORD
DONNE LOOKED AT IT DECLARED THE SUBSCRIPTION SHABBY AND
CLAMOROUSLY DEMANDED MORE
MISS KEELDAR FLUSHED UP WITH SOME INDIGNATION
AND MORE ASTONISHMENT
AT PRESENT I SHALL GIVE NO MORE SAID SHE
NOT GIVE MORE WHY I EXPECTED YOU TO HEAD THE LIST WITH A COOL
HUNDRED
WITH YOUR PROPERTY YOU SHOULD NEVER PUT DOWN A SIGNATURE FOR
LESS
SHE WAS SILENT
IN THE SOUTH WENT ON DONNE A LADY WITH A THOUSAND A YEAR WOULD BE
ASHAMED TO GIVE FIVE POUNDS FOR A PUBLIC OBJECT
SHIRLEY SO RARELY HAUGHTY LOOKED SO NOW
HER SLIGHT FRAME BECAME
NERVED HER DISTINGUISHED FACE QUICKENED WITH SCORN
STRANGE REMARKS SAID SHE MOST INCONSIDERATE REPROACH IN RETURN FOR
BOUNTY IS MISPLACED
BOUNTY DO YOU CALL FIVE POUNDS BOUNTY
I DO AND BOUNTY WHICH HAD I NOT GIVEN IT TO DR
BOULTBY'S INTENDED
SCHOOL OF THE ERECTION OF WHICH I APPROVE AND IN NO SORT TO HIS
CURATE WHO SEEMS ILL ADVISED IN HIS MANNER OF APPLYING FOR OR RATHER
EXTORTING SUBSCRIPTIONS BOUNTY I REPEAT WHICH BUT FOR THIS
CONSIDERATION I SHOULD INSTANTLY RECLAIM
DONNE WAS THICK SKINNED
HE DID NOT FEEL ALL OR HALF THAT THE TONE AIR
GLANCE OF THE SPEAKER EXPRESSED
HE KNEW NOT ON WHAT GROUND HE STOOD
WRETCHED PLACE THIS YORKSHIRE HE WENT ON
I COULD NEVER HAVE FORMED
AN IDEA R OF THE COUNTRY HAD I NOT SEEN IT
AND THE PEOPLE RICH AND
POOR WHAT A SET HOW CORSE AND UNCULTIVATED THEY WOULD BE SCOUTED IN
THE SOUTH
SHIRLEY LEANED FORWARDS ON THE TABLE HER NOSTRILS DILATING A LITTLE
HER TAPER FINGERS INTERLACED AND COMPRESSING EACH OTHER HARD
THE RICH PURSUED THE INFATUATED AND UNCONSCIOUS DONNE ARE A PARCEL
OF MISERS NEVER LIVING AS PERSONS WITH THEIR INCOMES OUGHT TO LIVE
YOU
SCARSLEY YOU MUST EXCUSE MR
DONNE'S PRONUNCIATION READER IT WAS
VERY CHOICE HE CONSIDERED IT GENTEEL AND PRIDED HIMSELF ON HIS
SOUTHERN ACCENT NORTHERN EARS RECEIVED WITH SINGULAR SENSATIONS HIS
UTTERANCE OF CERTAIN WORDS YOU SCARSLEY EVER SEE A FAM'LY WHERE A
PROPA CARRIAGE OR A REG'LA BUTLA IS KEP AND AS TO THE POOR JUST LOOK
AT THEM WHEN THEY COME CROWDING ABOUT THE CHURCH DOORS ON THE OCCASION
OF A MARRIAGE OR A FUNERAL CLATTERING IN CLOGS THE MEN IN THEIR
SHIRT SLEEVES AND WOOL COMBERS' APRONS THE WOMEN IN MOB CAPS AND
BED GOWNS
THEY POSITIVELY DESERVE THAT ONE SHOULD TURN A MAD COW IN
AMONGST THEM TO ROUT THEIR RABBLE RANKS
HE HE WHAT FUN IT WOULD BE
THERE YOU HAVE REACHED THE CLIMAX SAID SHIRLEY QUIETLY
YOU HAVE
REACHED THE CLIMAX SHE REPEATED TURNING HER GLOWING GLANCE TOWARDS
HIM
YOU CANNOT GO BEYOND IT AND SHE ADDED WITH EMPHASIS YOU
SHALL NOT IN MY HOUSE
UP SHE ROSE NOBODY COULD CONTROL HER NOW FOR SHE WAS
EXASPERATED STRAIGHT SHE WALKED TO HER GARDEN GATES WIDE SHE FLUNG
THEM OPEN
WALK THROUGH SHE SAID AUSTERELY AND PRETTY QUICKLY AND SET FOOT ON
THIS PAVEMENT NO MORE
DONNE WAS ASTOUNDED
HE HAD THOUGHT ALL THE TIME HE WAS SHOWING HIMSELF
OFF TO HIGH ADVANTAGE AS A LOFTY SOULED PERSON OF THE FIRST TON HE
IMAGINED HE WAS PRODUCING A CRUSHING IMPRESSION
HAD HE NOT EXPRESSED
DISDAIN OF EVERYTHING IN YORKSHIRE WHAT MORE CONCLUSIVE PROOF COULD BE
GIVEN THAT HE WAS BETTER THAN ANYTHING THERE AND YET HERE WAS HE ABOUT
TO BE TURNED LIKE A DOG OUT OF A YORKSHIRE GARDEN WHERE UNDER SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES WAS THE CONCATENATION ACCORDINGLY
RID ME OF YOU INSTANTLY INSTANTLY REITERATED SHIRLEY AS HE
LINGERED
MADAM A CLERGYMAN TURN OUT A CLERGYMAN
OFF WERE YOU AN ARCHBISHOP YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF NO GENTLEMAN AND
MUST GO
QUICK
SHE WAS QUITE RESOLVED
THERE WAS NO TRIFLING WITH HER
BESIDES TARTAR
WAS AGAIN RISING HE PERCEIVED SYMPTOMS OF A COMMOTION HE MANIFESTED A
DISPOSITION TO JOIN IN
THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GO
AND DONNE MADE HIS EXODUS THE HEIRESS SWEEPING HIM A DEEP CURTSY AS SHE
CLOSED THE GATES ON HIM
HOW DARE THE POMPOUS PRIEST ABUSE HIS FLOCK HOW DARE THE LISPING
COCKNEY REVILE YORKSHIRE WAS HER SOLE OBSERVATION ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE
AS SHE RETURNED TO THE TABLE
ERE LONG THE LITTLE PARTY BROKE UP MISS KEELDAR'S RUFFLED AND DARKENED
BROW CURLED LIP AND INCENSED EYE GAVE NO INVITATION TO FURTHER SOCIAL
ENJOYMENT
CHAPTER XVI
WHITSUNTIDE
THE FUND PROSPERED
BY DINT OF MISS KEELDAR'S EXAMPLE THE THREE
RECTORS' VIGOROUS EXERTIONS AND THE EFFICIENT THOUGH QUIET AID OF THEIR
SPINSTER AND SPECTACLED LIEUTENANTS MARY ANN AINLEY AND MARGARET HALL
A HANDSOME SUM WAS RAISED AND THIS BEING JUDICIOUSLY MANAGED SERVED
FOR THE PRESENT GREATLY TO ALLEVIATE THE DISTRESS OF THE UNEMPLOYED
POOR
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SEEMED TO GROW CALMER
FOR A FORTNIGHT PAST NO
CLOTH HAD BEEN DESTROYED NO OUTRAGE ON MILL OR MANSION HAD BEEN
COMMITTED IN THE THREE PARISHES
SHIRLEY WAS SANGUINE THAT THE EVIL SHE
WISHED TO AVERT WAS ALMOST ESCAPED THAT THE THREATENED STORM WAS
PASSING OVER
WITH THE APPROACH OF SUMMER SHE FELT CERTAIN THAT TRADE
WOULD IMPROVE IT ALWAYS DID AND THEN THIS WEARY WAR COULD NOT LAST FOR
EVER PEACE MUST RETURN ONE DAY
WITH PEACE WHAT AN IMPULSE WOULD BE
GIVEN TO COMMERCE
SUCH WAS THE USUAL TENOR OF HER OBSERVATIONS TO HER TENANT GRARD
MOORE WHENEVER SHE MET HIM WHERE THEY COULD CONVERSE AND MOORE WOULD
LISTEN VERY QUIETLY TOO QUIETLY TO SATISFY HER
SHE WOULD THEN BY HER
IMPATIENT GLANCE DEMAND SOMETHING MORE FROM HIM SOME EXPLANATION OR AT
LEAST SOME ADDITIONAL REMARK
SMILING IN HIS WAY WITH THAT EXPRESSION
WHICH GAVE A REMARKABLE CAST OF SWEETNESS TO HIS MOUTH WHILE HIS BROW
REMAINED GRAVE HE WOULD ANSWER TO THE EFFECT THAT HIMSELF TOO TRUSTED
IN THE FINITE NATURE OF THE WAR THAT IT WAS INDEED ON THAT GROUND THE
ANCHOR OF HIS HOPES WAS FIXED THEREON HIS SPECULATIONS DEPENDED
FOR
YOU ARE AWARE HE WOULD CONTINUE THAT I NOW WORK HOLLOW'S MILL
ENTIRELY ON SPECULATION
I SELL NOTHING THERE IS NO MARKET FOR MY
GOODS
I MANUFACTURE FOR A FUTURE DAY
I MAKE MYSELF READY TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE FIRST OPENING THAT SHALL OCCUR
THREE MONTHS AGO THIS
WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ME I HAD EXHAUSTED BOTH CREDIT AND CAPITAL
YOU WELL
KNOW WHO CAME TO MY RESCUE FROM WHAT HAND I RECEIVED THE LOAN WHICH
SAVED ME
IT IS ON THE STRENGTH OF THAT LOAN I AM ENABLED TO CONTINUE
THE BOLD GAME WHICH A WHILE SINCE I FEARED I SHOULD NEVER PLAY MORE
TOTAL RUIN I KNOW WILL FOLLOW LOSS AND I AM AWARE THAT GAIN IS
DOUBTFUL BUT I AM QUITE CHEERFUL
SO LONG AS I CAN BE ACTIVE SO LONG
AS I CAN STRIVE SO LONG IN SHORT AS MY HANDS ARE NOT TIED IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE DEPRESSED
ONE YEAR NAY BUT SIX MONTHS OF THE
REIGN OF THE OLIVE AND I AM SAFE FOR AS YOU SAY PEACE WILL GIVE AN
IMPULSE TO COMMERCE
IN THIS YOU ARE RIGHT BUT AS TO THE RESTORED
TRANQUILLITY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AS TO THE PERMANENT GOOD EFFECT OF
YOUR CHARITABLE FUND I DOUBT
ELEEMOSYNARY RELIEF NEVER YET
TRANQUILLIZED THE WORKING CLASSES IT NEVER MADE THEM GRATEFUL IT IS
NOT IN HUMAN NATURE THAT IT SHOULD
I SUPPOSE WERE ALL THINGS ORDERED
ARIGHT THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE IN A POSITION TO NEED THAT HUMILIATING
RELIEF AND THIS THEY FEEL
WE SHOULD FEEL IT WERE WE SO PLACED
BESIDES TO WHOM SHOULD THEY BE GRATEFUL TO YOU TO THE CLERGY PERHAPS
BUT NOT TO US MILL OWNERS
THEY HATE US WORSE THAN EVER
THEN THE
DISAFFECTED HERE ARE IN CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE DISAFFECTED ELSEWHERE
NOTTINGHAM IS ONE OF THEIR HEADQUARTERS MANCHESTER ANOTHER BIRMINGHAM
A THIRD
THE SUBALTERNS RECEIVE ORDERS FROM THEIR CHIEFS THEY ARE IN A
GOOD STATE OF DISCIPLINE NO BLOW IS STRUCK WITHOUT MATURE DELIBERATION
IN SULTRY WEATHER YOU HAVE SEEN THE SKY THREATEN THUNDER DAY BY DAY AND
YET NIGHT AFTER NIGHT THE CLOUDS HAVE CLEARED AND THE SUN HAS SET
QUIETLY BUT THE DANGER WAS NOT GONE IT WAS ONLY DELAYED
THE
LONG THREATENING STORM IS SURE TO BREAK AT LAST
THERE IS ANALOGY
BETWEEN THE MORAL AND PHYSICAL ATMOSPHERE
WELL MR
MOORE SO THESE CONFERENCES ALWAYS ENDED TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELF
IF YOU THINK THAT I HAVE EVER DONE YOU ANY GOOD REWARD ME BY
PROMISING TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
I DO I WILL TAKE CLOSE AND WATCHFUL CARE
I WISH TO LIVE NOT TO DIE
THE FUTURE OPENS LIKE EDEN BEFORE ME AND STILL WHEN I LOOK DEEP INTO
THE SHADES OF MY PARADISE I SEE A VISION THAT I LIKE BETTER THAN SERAPH
OR CHERUB GLIDE ACROSS REMOTE VISTAS
DO YOU PRAY WHAT VISION
I SEE
THE MAID CAME BUSTLING IN WITH THE TEA THINGS
THE EARLY PART OF THAT MAY AS WE HAVE SEEN WAS FINE THE MIDDLE WAS
WET BUT IN THE LAST WEEK AT CHANGE OF MOON IT CLEARED AGAIN
A FRESH
WIND SWEPT OFF THE SILVER WHITE DEEP PILED RAIN CLOUDS BEARING THEM
MASS ON MASS TO THE EASTERN HORIZON ON WHOSE VERGE THEY DWINDLED AND
BEHIND WHOSE RIM THEY DISAPPEARED LEAVING THE VAULT BEHIND ALL PURE
BLUE SPACE READY FOR THE REIGN OF THE SUMMER SUN
THAT SUN ROSE BROAD
ON WHITSUNTIDE
THE GATHERING OF THE SCHOOLS WAS SIGNALIZED BY SPLENDID
WEATHER
WHIT TUESDAY WAS THE GREAT DAY IN PREPARATION FOR WHICH THE TWO LARGE
SCHOOLROOMS OF BRIARFIELD BUILT BY THE PRESENT RECTOR CHIEFLY AT HIS
OWN EXPENSE WERE CLEANED OUT WHITEWASHED REPAINTED AND DECORATED
WITH FLOWERS AND EVERGREENS SOME FROM THE RECTORY GARDEN TWO CARTLOADS
FROM FIELDHEAD AND A WHEEL BARROWFUL FROM THE MORE STINGY DOMAIN OF DE
WALDEN THE RESIDENCE OF MR
WYNNE
IN THESE SCHOOLROOMS TWENTY TABLES
EACH CALCULATED TO ACCOMMODATE TWENTY GUESTS WERE LAID OUT SURROUNDED
WITH BENCHES AND COVERED WITH WHITE CLOTHS
ABOVE THEM WERE SUSPENDED
AT LEAST SOME TWENTY CAGES CONTAINING AS MANY CANARIES ACCORDING TO A
FANCY OF THE DISTRICT SPECIALLY CHERISHED BY MR
HELSTONE'S CLERK WHO
DELIGHTED IN THE PIERCING SONG OF THESE BIRDS AND KNEW THAT AMIDST
CONFUSION OF TONGUES THEY ALWAYS CAROLLED LOUDEST
THESE TABLES BE IT
UNDERSTOOD WERE NOT SPREAD FOR THE TWELVE HUNDRED SCHOLARS TO BE
ASSEMBLED FROM THE THREE PARISHES BUT ONLY FOR THE PATRONS AND TEACHERS
OF THE SCHOOLS
THE CHILDREN'S FEAST WAS TO BE SPREAD IN THE OPEN AIR
AT ONE O'CLOCK THE TROOPS WERE TO COME IN AT TWO THEY WERE TO BE
MARSHALLED TILL FOUR THEY WERE TO PARADE THE PARISH THEN CAME THE
FEAST AND AFTERWARDS THE MEETING WITH MUSIC AND SPEECHIFYING IN THE
CHURCH
WHY BRIARFIELD WAS CHOSEN FOR THE POINT OF RENDEZVOUS THE SCENE OF THE
FTE SHOULD BE EXPLAINED
IT WAS NOT BECAUSE IT WAS THE LARGEST OR
MOST POPULOUS PARISH WHINBURY FAR OUTDID IT IN THAT RESPECT NOR
BECAUSE IT WAS THE OLDEST ANTIQUE AS WERE THE HOARY CHURCH AND
RECTORY NUNNELY'S LOW ROOFED TEMPLE AND MOSSY PARSONAGE BURIED BOTH IN
COEVAL OAKS OUTSTANDING SENTINELS OF NUNNWOOD WERE OLDER STILL
IT WAS
SIMPLY BECAUSE MR
HELSTONE WILLED IT SO AND MR
HELSTONE'S WILL WAS
STRONGER THAN THAT OF BOULTBY OR HALL THE FORMER COULD NOT THE
LATTER WOULD NOT DISPUTE A POINT OF PRECEDENCE WITH THEIR RESOLUTE
AND IMPERIOUS BROTHER
THEY LET HIM LEAD AND RULE
THIS NOTABLE ANNIVERSARY HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO BEEN A TRYING DAY TO
CAROLINE HELSTONE BECAUSE IT DRAGGED HER PERFORCE INTO PUBLIC
COMPELLING HER TO FACE ALL THAT WAS WEALTHY RESPECTABLE INFLUENTIAL IN
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN WHOSE PRESENCE BUT FOR THE KIND COUNTENANCE OF
MR
HALL SHE WOULD HAVE APPEARED UNSUPPORTED
OBLIGED TO BE
CONSPICUOUS OBLIGED TO WALK AT THE HEAD OF HER REGIMENT AS THE RECTOR'S
NIECE AND FIRST TEACHER OF THE FIRST CLASS OBLIGED TO MAKE TEA AT THE
FIRST TABLE FOR A MIXED MULTITUDE OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND TO DO ALL
THIS WITHOUT THE COUNTENANCE OF MOTHER AUNT OR OTHER CHAPERON SHE
MEANTIME BEING A NERVOUS PERSON WHO MORTALLY FEARED PUBLICITY IT WILL
BE COMPREHENDED THAT UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE TREMBLED AT THE
APPROACH OF WHITSUNTIDE
BUT THIS YEAR SHIRLEY WAS TO BE WITH HER AND THAT CHANGED THE ASPECT OF
THE TRIAL SINGULARLY IT CHANGED IT UTTERLY
IT WAS A TRIAL NO
LONGER IT WAS ALMOST AN ENJOYMENT
MISS KEELDAR WAS BETTER IN HER
SINGLE SELF THAN A HOST OF ORDINARY FRIENDS
QUITE SELF POSSESSED AND
ALWAYS SPIRITED AND EASY CONSCIOUS OF HER SOCIAL IMPORTANCE YET NEVER
PRESUMING UPON IT IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO GIVE ONE COURAGE ONLY TO LOOK
AT HER
THE ONLY FEAR WAS LEST THE HEIRESS SHOULD NOT BE PUNCTUAL TO
TRYST
SHE OFTEN HAD A CARELESS WAY OF LINGERING BEHIND TIME AND
CAROLINE KNEW HER UNCLE WOULD NOT WAIT A SECOND FOR ANY ONE
AT THE
MOMENT OF THE CHURCH CLOCK TOLLING TWO THE BELLS WOULD CLASH OUT AND
THE MARCH BEGIN
SHE MUST LOOK AFTER SHIRLEY THEN IN THIS MATTER OR
HER EXPECTED COMPANION WOULD FAIL HER
WHIT TUESDAY SAW HER RISE ALMOST WITH THE SUN
SHE FANNY AND ELIZA
WERE BUSY THE WHOLE MORNING ARRANGING THE RECTORY PARLOURS IN FIRST RATE
COMPANY ORDER AND SETTING OUT A COLLATION OF COOLING
REFRESHMENTS WINE FRUIT CAKES ON THE DINING ROOM SIDEBOARD
THEN SHE
HAD TO DRESS IN HER FRESHEST AND FAIREST ATTIRE OF WHITE MUSLIN THE
PERFECT FINENESS OF THE DAY AND THE SOLEMNITY OF THE OCCASION WARRANTED
AND EVEN EXACTED SUCH COSTUME
HER NEW SASH A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FROM
MARGARET HALL WHICH SHE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE CYRIL HIMSELF HAD BOUGHT
AND IN RETURN FOR WHICH SHE HAD INDEED GIVEN HIM A SET OF CAMBRIC BANDS
IN A HANDSOME CASE WAS TIED BY THE DEXTEROUS FINGERS OF FANNY WHO TOOK
NO LITTLE PLEASURE IN ARRAYING HER FAIR YOUNG MISTRESS FOR THE OCCASION
HER SIMPLE BONNET HAD BEEN TRIMMED TO CORRESPOND WITH HER SASH HER
PRETTY BUT INEXPENSIVE SCARF OF WHITE CRAPE SUITED HER DRESS
WHEN READY
SHE FORMED A PICTURE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH TO DAZZLE BUT FAIR ENOUGH TO
INTEREST NOT BRILLIANTLY STRIKING BUT VERY DELICATELY PLEASING A
PICTURE IN WHICH SWEETNESS OF TINT PURITY OF AIR AND GRACE OF MIEN
ATONED FOR THE ABSENCE OF RICH COLOURING AND MAGNIFICENT CONTOUR
WHAT
HER BROWN EYE AND CLEAR FOREHEAD SHOWED OF HER MIND WAS IN KEEPING WITH
HER DRESS AND FACE MODEST GENTLE AND THOUGH PENSIVE HARMONIOUS
IT
APPEARED THAT NEITHER LAMB NOR DOVE NEED FEAR HER BUT WOULD WELCOME
RATHER IN HER LOOK OF SIMPLICITY AND SOFTNESS A SYMPATHY WITH THEIR
OWN NATURES OR WITH THE NATURES WE ASCRIBE TO THEM
AFTER ALL SHE WAS AN IMPERFECT FAULTY HUMAN BEING FAIR ENOUGH OF
FORM HUE AND ARRAY BUT AS CYRIL HALL SAID NEITHER SO GOOD NOR SO
GREAT AS THE WITHERED MISS AINLEY NOW PUTTING ON HER BEST BLACK GOWN
AND QUAKER DRAB SHAWL AND BONNET IN HER OWN NARROW COTTAGE CHAMBER
AWAY CAROLINE WENT ACROSS SOME VERY SEQUESTERED FIELDS AND THROUGH SOME
QUITE HIDDEN LANES TO FIELDHEAD
SHE GLIDED QUICKLY UNDER THE GREEN
HEDGES AND ACROSS THE GREENER LEAS
THERE WAS NO DUST NO MOISTURE TO
SOIL THE HEM OF HER STAINLESS GARMENT OR TO DAMP HER SLENDER SANDAL
AFTER THE LATE RAINS ALL WAS CLEAN AND UNDER THE PRESENT GLOWING SUN
ALL WAS DRY
SHE WALKED FEARLESSLY THEN ON DAISY AND TURF AND THROUGH
THICK PLANTATIONS SHE REACHED FIELDHEAD AND PENETRATED TO MISS
KEELDAR'S DRESSING ROOM
IT WAS WELL SHE HAD COME OR SHIRLEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO LATE
INSTEAD
OF MAKING READY WITH ALL SPEED SHE LAY STRETCHED ON A COUCH ABSORBED
IN READING
MRS
PRYOR STOOD NEAR VAINLY URGING HER TO RISE AND DRESS
CAROLINE WASTED NO WORDS
SHE IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE BOOK FROM HER AND
WITH HER OWN HANDS COMMENCED THE BUSINESS OF DISROBING AND REROBING HER
SHIRLEY INDOLENT WITH THE HEAT AND GAY WITH HER YOUTH AND PLEASURABLE
NATURE WANTED TO TALK LAUGH AND LINGER BUT CAROLINE INTENT ON BEING
IN TIME PERSEVERED IN DRESSING HER AS FAST AS FINGERS COULD FASTEN
STRINGS OR INSERT PINS
AT LENGTH AS SHE UNITED A FINAL ROW OF HOOKS
AND EYES SHE FOUND LEISURE TO CHIDE HER SAYING SHE WAS VERY NAUGHTY TO
BE SO UNPUNCTUAL THAT SHE LOOKED EVEN NOW THE PICTURE OF INCORRIGIBLE
CARELESSNESS AND SO SHIRLEY DID BUT A VERY LOVELY PICTURE OF THAT
TIRESOME QUALITY
SHE PRESENTED QUITE A CONTRAST TO CAROLINE
THERE WAS STYLE IN EVERY
FOLD OF HER DRESS AND EVERY LINE OF HER FIGURE
THE RICH SILK SUITED HER
BETTER THAN A SIMPLER COSTUME THE DEEP EMBROIDERED SCARF BECAME HER
SHE WORE IT NEGLIGENTLY BUT GRACEFULLY
THE WREATH ON HER BONNET
CROWNED HER WELL
THE ATTENTION TO FASHION THE TASTEFUL APPLIANCE OF
ORNAMENT IN EACH PORTION OF HER DRESS WERE QUITE IN PLACE WITH HER
ALL
THIS SUITED HER LIKE THE FRANK LIGHT IN HER EYES THE RALLYING SMILE
ABOUT HER LIPS LIKE HER SHAFT STRAIGHT CARRIAGE AND LIGHTSOME STEP
CAROLINE TOOK HER HAND WHEN SHE WAS DRESSED HURRIED HER DOWNSTAIRS OUT
OF DOORS AND THUS THEY SPED THROUGH THE FIELDS LAUGHING AS THEY WENT
AND LOOKING VERY MUCH LIKE A SNOW WHITE DOVE AND GEM TINTED BIRD OF
PARADISE JOINED IN SOCIAL FLIGHT
THANKS TO MISS HELSTONE'S PROMPTITUDE THEY ARRIVED IN GOOD TIME
WHILE
YET TREES HID THE CHURCH THEY HEARD THE BELL TOLLING A MEASURED BUT
URGENT SUMMONS FOR ALL TO ASSEMBLE
THE TROOPING IN OF NUMBERS THE
TRAMPLING OF MANY STEPS AND MURMURING OF MANY VOICES WERE LIKEWISE
AUDIBLE
FROM A RISING GROUND THEY PRESENTLY SAW ON THE WHINBURY ROAD
THE WHINBURY SCHOOL APPROACHING
IT NUMBERED FIVE HUNDRED SOULS
THE
RECTOR AND CURATE BOULTBY AND DONNE HEADED IT THE FORMER LOOMING
LARGE IN FULL CANONICALS WALKING AS BECAME A BENEFICED PRIEST UNDER
THE CANOPY OF A SHOVEL HAT WITH THE DIGNITY OF AN AMPLE CORPORATION
THE EMBELLISHMENT OF THE SQUAREST AND VASTEST OF BLACK COATS AND THE
SUPPORT OF THE STOUTEST OF GOLD HEADED CANES
AS THE DOCTOR WALKED HE
NOW AND THEN SLIGHTLY FLOURISHED HIS CANE AND INCLINED HIS SHOVEL HAT
WITH A DOGMATICAL WAG TOWARDS HIS AIDE DE CAMP
THAT
AIDE DE CAMP DONNE TO WIT NARROW AS THE LINE OF HIS SHAPE WAS
COMPARED TO THE BROAD BULK OF HIS PRINCIPAL CONTRIVED NOTWITHSTANDING
TO LOOK EVERY INCH A CURATE
ALL ABOUT HIM WAS PRAGMATICAL AND
SELF COMPLACENT FROM HIS TURNED UP NOSE AND ELEVATED CHIN TO HIS
CLERICAL BLACK GAITERS HIS SOMEWHAT SHORT STRAPLESS TROUSERS AND HIS
SQUARE TOED SHOES
WALK ON MR
DONNE YOU HAVE UNDERGONE SCRUTINY
YOU THINK YOU LOOK
WELL
WHETHER THE WHITE AND PURPLE FIGURES WATCHING YOU FROM YONDER HILL
THINK SO IS ANOTHER QUESTION
THESE FIGURES COME RUNNING DOWN WHEN THE REGIMENT HAS MARCHED BY
THE
CHURCHYARD IS FULL OF CHILDREN AND TEACHERS ALL IN THEIR VERY BEST
HOLIDAY ATTIRE AND DISTRESSED AS IS THE DISTRICT BAD AS ARE THE
TIMES IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE HOW RESPECTABLY HOW HANDSOMELY EVEN THEY
HAVE CONTRIVED TO CLOTHE THEMSELVES
THAT BRITISH LOVE OF DECENCY WILL
WORK MIRACLES
THE POVERTY WHICH REDUCES AN IRISH GIRL TO RAGS IS
IMPOTENT TO ROB THE ENGLISH GIRL OF THE NEAT WARDROBE SHE KNOWS
NECESSARY TO HER SELF RESPECT
BESIDES THE LADY OF THE MANOR THAT
SHIRLEY NOW GAZING WITH PLEASURE ON THIS WELL DRESSED AND HAPPY LOOKING
CROWD HAS REALLY DONE THEM GOOD
HER SEASONABLE BOUNTY CONSOLED MANY A
POOR FAMILY AGAINST THE COMING HOLIDAY AND SUPPLIED MANY A CHILD WITH A
NEW FROCK OR BONNET FOR THE OCCASION
SHE KNOWS IT AND IS ELATE WITH
THE CONSCIOUSNESS GLAD THAT HER MONEY EXAMPLE AND INFLUENCE HAVE
REALLY SUBSTANTIALLY BENEFITED THOSE AROUND HER
SHE CANNOT BE
CHARITABLE LIKE MISS AINLEY IT IS NOT IN HER NATURE
IT RELIEVES HER TO
FEEL THAT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF BEING CHARITABLE PRACTICABLE FOR
OTHER CHARACTERS AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
CAROLINE TOO IS PLEASED FOR SHE ALSO HAS DONE GOOD IN HER SMALL
WAY ROBBED HERSELF OF MORE THAN ONE DRESS RIBBON OR COLLAR SHE COULD
ILL SPARE TO AID IN FITTING OUT THE SCHOLARS OF HER CLASS AND AS SHE
COULD NOT GIVE MONEY SHE HAS FOLLOWED MISS AINLEY'S EXAMPLE IN GIVING
HER TIME AND HER INDUSTRY TO SEW FOR THE CHILDREN
NOT ONLY IS THE CHURCHYARD FULL BUT THE RECTORY GARDEN IS ALSO
THRONGED
PAIRS AND PARTIES OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARE SEEN WALKING
AMONGST THE WAVING LILACS AND LABURNUMS
THE HOUSE ALSO IS OCCUPIED AT
THE WIDE OPEN PARLOUR WINDOWS GAY GROUPS ARE STANDING
THESE ARE THE
PATRONS AND TEACHERS WHO ARE TO SWELL THE PROCESSION
IN THE PARSON'S
CROFT BEHIND THE RECTORY ARE THE MUSICIANS OF THE THREE PARISH BANDS
WITH THEIR INSTRUMENTS
FANNY AND ELIZA IN THE SMARTEST OF CAPS AND
GOWNS AND THE WHITEST OF APRONS MOVE AMONGST THEM SERVING OUT QUARTS
OF ALE WHEREOF A STOCK WAS BREWED VERY SOUND AND STRONG SOME WEEKS
SINCE BY THE RECTOR'S ORDERS AND UNDER HIS SPECIAL SUPERINTENDENCE
WHATEVER HE HAD A HAND IN MUST BE MANAGED HANDSOMELY
SHABBY DOINGS OF
ANY DESCRIPTION WERE NOT ENDURED UNDER HIS SANCTION
FROM THE ERECTION
OF A PUBLIC BUILDING A CHURCH SCHOOL OR COURT HOUSE TO THE COOKING
OF A DINNER HE STILL ADVOCATED THE LORDLY LIBERAL AND EFFECTIVE
MISS
KEELDAR WAS LIKE HIM IN THIS RESPECT AND THEY MUTUALLY APPROVED EACH
OTHER'S ARRANGEMENTS
CAROLINE AND SHIRLEY WERE SOON IN THE MIDST OF THE COMPANY
THE FORMER
MET THEM VERY EASILY FOR HER
INSTEAD OF SITTING DOWN IN A RETIRED
CORNER OR STEALING AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM TILL THE PROCESSION SHOULD BE
MARSHALLED ACCORDING TO HER WONT SHE MOVED THROUGH THE THREE
PARLOURS CONVERSED AND SMILED ABSOLUTELY SPOKE ONCE OR TWICE ERE SHE
WAS SPOKEN TO AND IN SHORT SEEMED A NEW CREATURE
IT WAS SHIRLEY'S
PRESENCE WHICH THUS TRANSFORMED HER THE VIEW OF MISS KEELDAR'S AIR AND
MANNER DID HER A WORLD OF GOOD
SHIRLEY HAD NO FEAR OF HER KIND NO
TENDENCY TO SHRINK FROM TO AVOID IT
ALL HUMAN BEINGS MEN WOMEN OR
CHILDREN WHOM LOW BREEDING OR COARSE PRESUMPTION DID NOT RENDER
POSITIVELY OFFENSIVE WERE WELCOME ENOUGH TO HER SOME MUCH MORE SO THAN
OTHERS OF COURSE BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING TILL A MAN HAD INDISPUTABLY
PROVED HIMSELF BAD AND A NUISANCE SHIRLEY WAS WILLING TO THINK HIM GOOD
AND AN ACQUISITION AND TO TREAT HIM ACCORDINGLY
THIS DISPOSITION MADE
HER A GENERAL FAVOURITE FOR IT ROBBED HER VERY RAILLERY OF ITS STING
AND GAVE HER SERIOUS OR SMILING CONVERSATION A HAPPY CHARM NOR DID IT
DIMINISH THE VALUE OF HER INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP WHICH WAS A DISTINCT
THING FROM THIS SOCIAL BENEVOLENCE DEPENDING INDEED ON QUITE A
DIFFERENT PART OF HER CHARACTER
MISS HELSTONE WAS THE CHOICE OF HER
AFFECTION AND INTELLECT THE MISSES PEARSON SYKES WYNNE ETC ETC
ONLY THE PROFITEERS BY HER GOOD NATURE AND VIVACITY
DONNE HAPPENED TO COME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHILE SHIRLEY SITTING ON
THE SOFA FORMED THE CENTRE OF A TOLERABLY WIDE CIRCLE
SHE HAD ALREADY
FORGOTTEN HER EXASPERATION AGAINST HIM AND SHE BOWED AND SMILED
GOOD HUMOUREDLY
THE DISPOSITION OF THE MAN WAS THEN SEEN
HE KNEW
NEITHER HOW TO DECLINE THE ADVANCE WITH DIGNITY AS ONE WHOSE JUST PRIDE
HAS BEEN WOUNDED NOR HOW TO MEET IT WITH FRANKNESS AS ONE WHO IS GLAD
TO FORGET AND FORGIVE
HIS PUNISHMENT HAD IMPRESSED HIM WITH NO SENSE OF
SHAME AND HE DID NOT EXPERIENCE THAT FEELING ON ENCOUNTERING HIS
CHASTISER
HE WAS NOT VIGOROUS ENOUGH IN EVIL TO BE ACTIVELY
MALIGNANT HE MERELY PASSED BY SHEEPISHLY WITH A RATED SCOWLING LOOK
NOTHING COULD EVER AGAIN RECONCILE HIM TO HIS ENEMY WHILE NO PASSION OF
RESENTMENT FOR EVEN SHARPER AND MORE IGNOMINIOUS INFLICTIONS COULD HIS
LYMPHATIC NATURE KNOW
HE WAS NOT WORTH A SCENE SAID SHIRLEY TO CAROLINE
WHAT A FOOL I
WAS TO REVENGE ON POOR DONNE HIS SILLY SPITE AT YORKSHIRE IS SOMETHING
LIKE CRUSHING A GNAT FOR ATTACKING THE HIDE OF A RHINOCEROS
HAD I BEEN
A GENTLEMAN I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE HELPED HIM OFF THE PREMISES BY DINT
OF PHYSICAL FORCE
I AM GLAD NOW I ONLY EMPLOYED THE MORAL WEAPON
BUT
HE MUST COME NEAR ME NO MORE
I DON'T LIKE HIM
HE IRRITATES ME
THERE
IS NOT EVEN AMUSEMENT TO BE HAD OUT OF HIM
MALONE IS BETTER SPORT
IT SEEMED AS IF MALONE WISHED TO JUSTIFY THE PREFERENCE FOR THE WORDS
WERE SCARCELY OUT OF THE SPEAKER'S MOUTH WHEN PETER AUGUSTUS CAME UP
ALL IN GRANDE TENUE GLOVED AND SCENTED WITH HIS HAIR OILED AND
BRUSHED TO PERFECTION AND BEARING IN ONE HAND A HUGE BUNCH OF
CABBAGE ROSES FIVE OR SIX IN FULL BLOW
THESE HE PRESENTED TO THE
HEIRESS WITH A GRACE TO WHICH THE MOST CUNNING PENCIL COULD DO BUT
DEFECTIVE JUSTICE
AND WHO AFTER THIS COULD DARE TO SAY THAT PETER WAS
NOT A LADY'S MAN HE HAD GATHERED AND HE HAD GIVEN FLOWERS HE HAD
OFFERED A SENTIMENTAL A POETIC TRIBUTE AT THE SHRINE OF LOVE OR MAMMON
HERCULES HOLDING THE DISTAFF WAS BUT A FAINT TYPE OF PETER BEARING THE
ROSES
HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT THIS HIMSELF FOR HE SEEMED AMAZED AT WHAT
HE HAD DONE
HE BACKED WITHOUT A WORD HE WAS GOING AWAY WITH A HUSKY
CHUCKLE OF SELF SATISFACTION THEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF TO STOP AND
TURN TO ASCERTAIN BY OCULAR TESTIMONY THAT HE REALLY HAD PRESENTED A
BOUQUET
YES THERE WERE THE SIX RED CABBAGES ON THE PURPLE SATIN LAP A
VERY WHITE HAND WITH SOME GOLD RINGS ON THE FINGERS SLIGHTLY HOLDING
THEM TOGETHER AND STREAMING RINGLETS HALF HIDING A LAUGHING FACE
DROOPED OVER THEM
ONLY HALF HIDING PETER SAW THE LAUGH IT WAS
UNMISTAKABLE
HE WAS MADE A JOKE OF HIS GALLANTRY HIS CHIVALRY WERE
THE SUBJECT OF A JEST FOR A PETTICOAT FOR TWO PETTICOATS MISS HELSTONE
TOO WAS SMILING
MOREOVER HE FELT HE WAS SEEN THROUGH AND PETER GREW
BLACK AS A THUNDER CLOUD
WHEN SHIRLEY LOOKED UP A FELL EYE WAS
FASTENED ON HER
MALONE AT LEAST HAD ENERGY ENOUGH IN HATE
SHE SAW IT
IN HIS GLANCE
PETER IS WORTH A SCENE AND SHALL HAVE IT IF HE LIKES ONE DAY SHE
WHISPERED TO HER FRIEND
AND NOW SOLEMN AND SOMBRE AS TO THEIR COLOUR THOUGH BLAND ENOUGH AS TO
THEIR FACES APPEARED AT THE DINING ROOM DOOR THE THREE RECTORS
THEY
HAD HITHERTO BEEN BUSY IN THE CHURCH AND WERE NOW COMING TO TAKE SOME
LITTLE REFRESHMENT FOR THE BODY ERE THE MARCH COMMENCED
THE LARGE
MOROCCO COVERED EASY CHAIR HAD BEEN LEFT VACANT FOR DR
BOULTBY
HE WAS
PUT INTO IT AND CAROLINE OBEYING THE INSTIGATIONS OF SHIRLEY WHO TOLD
HER NOW WAS THE TIME TO PLAY THE HOSTESS HASTENED TO HAND TO HER
UNCLE'S VAST REVERED AND ON THE WHOLE WORTHY FRIEND A GLASS OF
WINE AND A PLATE OF MACAROONS
BOULTBY'S CHURCHWARDENS PATRONS OF THE
SUNDAY SCHOOL BOTH AS HE INSISTED ON THEIR BEING WERE ALREADY BESIDE
HIM MRS
SYKES AND THE OTHER LADIES OF HIS CONGREGATION WERE ON HIS
RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT EXPRESSING THEIR HOPES THAT HE WAS NOT
FATIGUED THEIR FEARS THAT THE DAY WOULD BE TOO WARM FOR HIM
MRS
BOULTBY WHO HELD AN OPINION THAT WHEN HER LORD DROPPED ASLEEP AFTER A
GOOD DINNER HIS FACE BECAME AS THE FACE OF AN ANGEL WAS BENDING OVER
HIM TENDERLY WIPING SOME PERSPIRATION REAL OR IMAGINARY FROM HIS
BROW
BOULTBY IN SHORT WAS IN HIS GLORY AND IN A ROUND SOUND VOIX
DE POITRINE HE RUMBLED OUT THANKS FOR ATTENTIONS AND ASSURANCES OF HIS
TOLERABLE HEALTH
OF CAROLINE HE TOOK NO MANNER OF NOTICE AS SHE CAME
NEAR SAVE TO ACCEPT WHAT SHE OFFERED
HE DID NOT SEE HER HE NEVER DID
SEE HER HE HARDLY KNEW THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED
HE SAW THE
MACAROONS HOWEVER AND BEING FOND OF SWEETS POSSESSED HIMSELF OF A
SMALL HANDFUL THEREOF
THE WINE MRS
BOULTBY INSISTED ON MINGLING WITH
HOT WATER AND QUALIFYING WITH SUGAR AND NUTMEG
MR
HALL STOOD NEAR AN OPEN WINDOW BREATHING THE FRESH AIR AND SCENT OF
FLOWERS AND TALKING LIKE A BROTHER TO MISS AINLEY
TO HIM CAROLINE
TURNED HER ATTENTION WITH PLEASURE
WHAT SHOULD SHE BRING HIM HE MUST
NOT HELP HIMSELF HE MUST BE SERVED BY HER AND SHE PROVIDED HERSELF
WITH A LITTLE SALVER THAT SHE MIGHT OFFER HIM VARIETY
MARGARET HALL
JOINED THEM SO DID MISS KEELDAR
THE FOUR LADIES STOOD ROUND THEIR
FAVOURITE PASTOR
THEY ALSO HAD AN IDEA THAT THEY LOOKED ON THE FACE OF
AN EARTHLY ANGEL
CYRIL HALL WAS THEIR POPE INFALLIBLE TO THEM AS DR
THOMAS BOULTBY TO HIS ADMIRERS
A THRONG TOO ENCLOSED THE RECTOR OF
BRIARFIELD TWENTY OR MORE PRESSED ROUND HIM AND NO PARSON WAS EVER
MORE POTENT IN A CIRCLE THAN OLD HELSTONE
THE CURATES HERDING TOGETHER
AFTER THEIR MANNER MADE A CONSTELLATION OF THREE LESSER PLANETS
DIVERS
YOUNG LADIES WATCHED THEM AFAR OFF BUT VENTURED NOT NIGH
MR
HELSTONE PRODUCED HIS WATCH
TEN MINUTES TO TWO HE ANNOUNCED
ALOUD
TIME FOR ALL TO FALL INTO LINE
COME HE SEIZED HIS SHOVEL HAT
AND MARCHED AWAY
ALL ROSE AND FOLLOWED EN MASSE
THE TWELVE HUNDRED CHILDREN WERE DRAWN UP IN THREE BODIES OF FOUR
HUNDRED SOULS EACH IN THE REAR OF EACH REGIMENT WAS STATIONED A BAND
BETWEEN EVERY TWENTY THERE WAS AN INTERVAL WHEREIN HELSTONE POSTED THE
TEACHERS IN PAIRS
TO THE VAN OF THE ARMIES HE SUMMONED
GRACE BOULTBY AND MARY SYKES LEAD OUT WHINBURY
MARGARET HALL AND MARY ANN AINLEY CONDUCT NUNNELY
CAROLINE HELSTONE AND SHIRLEY KEELDAR HEAD BRIARFIELD
THEN AGAIN HE GAVE COMMAND
MR
DONNE TO WHINBURY MR
SWEETING TO NUNNELY MR
MALONE TO
BRIARFIELD
AND THESE GENTLEMEN STEPPED UP BEFORE THE LADY GENERALS
THE RECTORS PASSED TO THE FULL FRONT THE PARISH CLERKS FELL TO THE
EXTREME REAR
HELSTONE LIFTED HIS SHOVEL HAT
IN AN INSTANT OUT CLASHED
THE EIGHT BELLS IN THE TOWER LOUD SWELLED THE SOUNDING BANDS FLUTE
SPOKE AND CLARION ANSWERED DEEP ROLLED THE DRUMS AND AWAY THEY
MARCHED
THE BROAD WHITE ROAD UNROLLED BEFORE THE LONG PROCESSION THE SUN AND
SKY SURVEYED IT CLOUDLESS THE WIND TOSSED THE TREE BOUGHS ABOVE IT AND
THE TWELVE HUNDRED CHILDREN AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ADULTS OF WHICH IT
WAS COMPOSED TROD ON IN TIME AND TUNE WITH GAY FACES AND GLAD HEARTS
IT WAS A JOYOUS SCENE AND A SCENE TO DO GOOD
IT WAS A DAY OF HAPPINESS
FOR RICH AND POOR THE WORK FIRST OF GOD AND THEN OF THE CLERGY
LET
ENGLAND'S PRIESTS HAVE THEIR DUE
THEY ARE A FAULTY SET IN SOME
RESPECTS BEING ONLY OF COMMON FLESH AND BLOOD LIKE US ALL BUT THE LAND
WOULD BE BADLY OFF WITHOUT THEM
BRITAIN WOULD MISS HER CHURCH IF THAT
CHURCH FELL
GOD SAVE IT GOD ALSO REFORM IT
CHAPTER XVII
THE SCHOOL FEAST
NOT ON COMBAT BENT NOR OF FOEMEN IN SEARCH WAS THIS PRIEST LED AND
WOMAN OFFICERED COMPANY YET THEIR MUSIC PLAYED MARTIAL TUNES AND TO
JUDGE BY THE EYES AND CARRIAGE OF SOME MISS KEELDAR FOR
INSTANCE THESE SOUNDS AWOKE IF NOT A MARTIAL YET A LONGING SPIRIT
OLD HELSTONE TURNING BY CHANCE LOOKED INTO HER FACE AND HE LAUGHED
AND SHE LAUGHED AT HIM
THERE IS NO BATTLE IN PROSPECT HE SAID OUR COUNTRY DOES NOT WANT US
TO FIGHT FOR IT
NO FOE OR TYRANT IS QUESTIONING OR THREATENING OUR
LIBERTY
THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE
WE ARE ONLY TAKING A WALK
KEEP
YOUR HAND ON THE REINS CAPTAIN AND SLACK THE FIRE OF THAT SPIRIT
IT
IS NOT WANTED THE MORE'S THE PITY
TAKE YOUR OWN ADVICE DOCTOR WAS SHIRLEY'S RESPONSE
TO CAROLINE SHE
MURMURED I'LL BORROW OF IMAGINATION WHAT REALITY WILL NOT GIVE ME
WE
ARE NOT SOLDIERS BLOODSHED IS NOT MY DESIRE OR IF WE ARE WE ARE
SOLDIERS OF THE CROSS
TIME HAS ROLLED BACK SOME HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND
WE ARE BOUND ON A PILGRIMAGE TO PALESTINE
BUT NO THAT IS TOO
VISIONARY
I NEED A STERNER DREAM
WE ARE LOWLANDERS OF SCOTLAND
FOLLOWING A COVENANTING CAPTAIN UP INTO THE HILLS TO HOLD A MEETING OUT
OF THE REACH OF PERSECUTING TROOPERS
WE KNOW THAT BATTLE MAY FOLLOW
PRAYER AND AS WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE WORST ISSUE OF BATTLE HEAVEN MUST
BE OUR REWARD WE ARE READY AND WILLING TO REDDEN THE PEAT MOSS WITH OUR
BLOOD
THAT MUSIC STIRS MY SOUL IT WAKENS ALL MY LIFE IT MAKES MY
HEART BEAT NOT WITH ITS TEMPERATE DAILY PULSE BUT WITH A NEW
THRILLING VIGOUR
I ALMOST LONG FOR DANGER FOR A FAITH A LAND OR AT
LEAST A LOVER TO DEFEND
LOOK SHIRLEY INTERRUPTED CAROLINE
WHAT IS THAT RED SPECK ABOVE
STILBRO' BROW YOU HAVE KEENER SIGHT THAN I
JUST TURN YOUR EAGLE EYE TO
IT
MISS KEELDAR LOOKED
I SEE SHE SAID THEN ADDED PRESENTLY THERE IS
A LINE OF RED
THEY ARE SOLDIERS CAVALRY SOLDIERS SHE SUBJOINED
QUICKLY
THEY RIDE FAST
THERE ARE SIX OF THEM
THEY WILL PASS US
NO
THEY HAVE TURNED OFF TO THE RIGHT
THEY SAW OUR PROCESSION AND AVOID IT
BY MAKING A CIRCUIT
WHERE ARE THEY GOING
PERHAPS THEY ARE ONLY EXERCISING THEIR HORSES
PERHAPS SO
WE SEE THEM NO MORE NOW
MR
HELSTONE HERE SPOKE
WE SHALL PASS THROUGH ROYD LANE TO REACH NUNNELY COMMON BY A SHORT
CUT SAID HE
AND INTO THE STRAITS OF ROYD LANE THEY ACCORDINGLY DEFILED
IT WAS VERY
NARROW SO NARROW THAT ONLY TWO COULD WALK ABREAST WITHOUT FALLING INTO
THE DITCH WHICH RAN ALONG EACH SIDE
THEY HAD GAINED THE MIDDLE OF IT
WHEN EXCITEMENT BECAME OBVIOUS IN THE CLERICAL COMMANDERS
BOULTBY'S
SPECTACLES AND HELSTONE'S REHOBOAM WERE AGITATED THE CURATES NUDGED
EACH OTHER MR
HALL TURNED TO THE LADIES AND SMILED
WHAT IS THE MATTER WAS THE DEMAND
HE POINTED WITH HIS STAFF TO THE END OF THE LANE BEFORE THEM
LO AND
BEHOLD ANOTHER AN OPPOSITION PROCESSION WAS THERE ENTERING HEADED
ALSO BY MEN IN BLACK AND FOLLOWED ALSO AS THEY COULD NOW HEAR BY
MUSIC
IS IT OUR DOUBLE ASKED SHIRLEY OUR MANIFOLD WRAITH HERE IS A CARD
TURNED UP
IF YOU WANTED A BATTLE YOU ARE LIKELY TO GET ONE AT LEAST OF LOOKS
WHISPERED CAROLINE LAUGHING
THEY SHALL NOT PASS US CRIED THE CURATES UNANIMOUSLY WE'LL NOT GIVE
WAY
GIVE WAY RETORTED HELSTONE STERNLY TURNING ROUND WHO TALKS OF
GIVING WAY YOU BOYS MIND WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT
THE LADIES I KNOW WILL
BE FIRM
I CAN TRUST THEM
THERE IS NOT A CHURCHWOMAN HERE BUT WILL
STAND HER GROUND AGAINST THESE FOLKS FOR THE HONOUR OF THE
ESTABLISHMENT WHAT DOES MISS KEELDAR SAY
SHE ASKS WHAT IS IT
THE DISSENTING AND METHODIST SCHOOLS THE BAPTISTS INDEPENDENTS AND
WESLEYANS JOINED IN UNHOLY ALLIANCE AND TURNING PURPOSELY INTO THIS
LANE WITH THE INTENTION OF OBSTRUCTING OUR MARCH AND DRIVING US BACK
BAD MANNERS SAID SHIRLEY AND I HATE BAD MANNERS
OF COURSE THEY
MUST HAVE A LESSON
A LESSON IN POLITENESS SUGGESTED MR
HALL WHO WAS EVER FOR PEACE
NOT AN EXAMPLE OF RUDENESS
OLD HELSTONE MOVED ON
QUICKENING HIS STEP HE MARCHED SOME YARDS IN
ADVANCE OF HIS COMPANY
HE HAD NEARLY REACHED THE OTHER SABLE LEADERS
WHEN HE WHO APPEARED TO ACT AS THE HOSTILE COMMANDER IN CHIEF A LARGE
GREASY MAN WITH BLACK HAIR COMBED FLAT ON HIS FOREHEAD CALLED A HALT
THE PROCESSION PAUSED
HE DREW FORTH A HYMN BOOK GAVE OUT A VERSE SET
A TUNE AND THEY ALL STRUCK UP THE MOST DOLOROUS OF CANTICLES
HELSTONE SIGNED TO HIS BANDS
THEY CLASHED OUT WITH ALL THE POWER OF
BRASS
HE DESIRED THEM TO PLAY RULE BRITANNIA AND ORDERED THE
CHILDREN TO JOIN IN VOCALLY WHICH THEY DID WITH ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT
THE ENEMY WAS SUNG AND STORMED DOWN HIS PSALM QUELLED
AS FAR AS NOISE
WENT HE WAS CONQUERED
NOW FOLLOW ME EXCLAIMED HELSTONE NOT AT A RUN BUT AT A FIRM
SMART PACE
BE STEADY EVERY CHILD AND WOMAN OF YOU
KEEP TOGETHER
HOLD
ON BY EACH OTHER'S SKIRTS IF NECESSARY
AND HE STRODE ON WITH SUCH A DETERMINED AND DELIBERATE GAIT AND WAS
BESIDES SO WELL SECONDED BY HIS SCHOLARS AND TEACHERS WHO DID EXACTLY
AS HE TOLD THEM NEITHER RUNNING NOR FALTERING BUT MARCHING WITH COOL
SOLID IMPETUS THE CURATES TOO BEING COMPELLED TO DO THE SAME AS THEY
WERE BETWEEN TWO FIRES HELSTONE AND MISS KEELDAR BOTH OF WHOM WATCHED
ANY DEVIATION WITH LYNX EYED VIGILANCE AND WERE READY THE ONE WITH HIS
CANE THE OTHER WITH HER PARASOL TO REBUKE THE SLIGHTEST BREACH OF
ORDERS THE LEAST INDEPENDENT OR IRREGULAR DEMONSTRATION THAT THE BODY
OF DISSENTERS WERE FIRST AMAZED THEN ALARMED THEN BORNE DOWN AND
PRESSED BACK AND AT LAST FORCED TO TURN TAIL AND LEAVE THE OUTLET FROM
ROYD LANE FREE
BOULTBY SUFFERED IN THE ONSLAUGHT BUT HELSTONE AND
MALONE BETWEEN THEM HELD HIM UP AND BROUGHT HIM THROUGH THE BUSINESS
WHOLE IN LIMB THOUGH SORELY TRIED IN WIND
THE FAT DISSENTER WHO HAD GIVEN OUT THE HYMN WAS LEFT SITTING IN THE
DITCH
HE WAS A SPIRIT MERCHANT BY TRADE A LEADER OF THE
NONCONFORMISTS AND IT WAS SAID DRANK MORE WATER IN THAT ONE AFTERNOON
THAN HE HAD SWALLOWED FOR A TWELVEMONTH BEFORE
MR
HALL HAD TAKEN CARE
OF CAROLINE AND CAROLINE OF HIM
HE AND MISS AINLEY MADE THEIR OWN
QUIET COMMENTS TO EACH OTHER AFTERWARDS ON THE INCIDENT
MISS KEELDAR
AND MR
HELSTONE SHOOK HANDS HEARTILY WHEN THEY HAD FAIRLY GOT THE WHOLE
PARTY THROUGH THE LANE
THE CURATES BEGAN TO EXULT BUT MR
HELSTONE
PRESENTLY PUT THE CURB ON THEIR INNOCENT SPIRITS
HE REMARKED THAT THEY
NEVER HAD SENSE TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND HAD BETTER HOLD THEIR TONGUES
AND HE REMINDED THEM THAT THE BUSINESS WAS NONE OF THEIR MANAGING
ABOUT HALF PAST THREE THE PROCESSION TURNED BACK AND AT FOUR ONCE MORE
REGAINED THE STARTING PLACE
LONG LINES OF BENCHES WERE ARRANGED IN THE
CLOSE SHORN FIELDS ROUND THE SCHOOL
THERE THE CHILDREN WERE SEATED AND
HUGE BASKETS COVERED UP WITH WHITE CLOTHS AND GREAT SMOKING TIN
VESSELS WERE BROUGHT OUT
ERE THE DISTRIBUTION OF GOOD THINGS COMMENCED
A BRIEF GRACE WAS PRONOUNCED BY MR
HALL AND SUNG BY THE CHILDREN
THEIR
YOUNG VOICES SOUNDED MELODIOUS EVEN TOUCHING IN THE OPEN AIR
LARGE
CURRANT BUNS AND HOT WELL SWEETENED TEA WERE THEN ADMINISTERED IN THE
PROPER SPIRIT OF LIBERALITY
NO STINTING WAS PERMITTED ON THIS DAY AT
LEAST THE RULE FOR EACH CHILD'S ALLOWANCE BEING THAT IT WAS TO HAVE
ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH AS IT COULD POSSIBLY EAT THUS LEAVING A RESERVE TO
BE CARRIED HOME FOR SUCH AS AGE SICKNESS OR OTHER IMPEDIMENT PREVENTED
FROM COMING TO THE FEAST
BUNS AND BEER CIRCULATED MEANTIME AMONGST
THE MUSICIANS AND CHURCH SINGERS AFTERWARDS THE BENCHES WERE REMOVED
AND THEY WERE LEFT TO UNBEND THEIR SPIRITS IN LICENSED PLAY
A BELL SUMMONED THE TEACHERS PATRONS AND PATRONESSES TO THE
SCHOOLROOM
MISS KEELDAR MISS HELSTONE AND MANY OTHER LADIES WERE
ALREADY THERE GLANCING OVER THE ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR SEPARATE TRAYS AND
TABLES
MOST OF THE FEMALE SERVANTS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TOGETHER WITH
THE CLERKS' THE SINGERS' AND THE MUSICIANS' WIVES HAD BEEN PRESSED
INTO THE SERVICE OF THE DAY AS WAITERS
EACH VIED WITH THE OTHER IN
SMARTNESS AND DAINTINESS OF DRESS AND MANY HANDSOME FORMS WERE SEEN
AMONGST THE YOUNGER ONES
ABOUT HALF A SCORE WERE CUTTING BREAD AND
BUTTER ANOTHER HALF SCORE SUPPLYING HOT WATER BROUGHT FROM THE COPPERS
OF THE RECTOR'S KITCHEN
THE PROFUSION OF FLOWERS AND EVERGREENS
DECORATING THE WHITE WALLS THE SHOW OF SILVER TEAPOTS AND BRIGHT
PORCELAIN ON THE TABLES THE ACTIVE FIGURES BLITHE FACES GAY DRESSES
FLITTING ABOUT EVERYWHERE FORMED ALTOGETHER A REFRESHING AND LIVELY
SPECTACLE
EVERYBODY TALKED NOT VERY LOUDLY BUT MERRILY AND THE
CANARY BIRDS SANG SHRILL IN THEIR HIGH HUNG CAGES
CAROLINE AS THE RECTOR'S NIECE TOOK HER PLACE AT ONE OF THE THREE
FIRST TABLES MRS
BOULTBY AND MARGARET HALL OFFICIATED AT THE OTHERS
AT THESE TABLES THE LITE OF THE COMPANY WERE TO BE ENTERTAINED
STRICT RULES OF EQUALITY NOT BEING MORE IN FASHION AT BRIARFIELD THAN
ELSEWHERE
MISS HELSTONE REMOVED HER BONNET AND SCARF THAT SHE MIGHT BE
LESS OPPRESSED WITH THE HEAT
HER LONG CURLS FALLING ON HER NECK
SERVED ALMOST IN PLACE OF A VEIL AND FOR THE REST HER MUSLIN DRESS WAS
FASHIONED MODESTLY AS A NUN'S ROBE ENABLING HER THUS TO DISPENSE WITH
THE ENCUMBRANCE OF A SHAWL
THE ROOM WAS FILLING
MR
HALL HAD TAKEN HIS POST BESIDE CAROLINE WHO
NOW AS SHE REARRANGED THE CUPS AND SPOONS BEFORE HER WHISPERED TO HIM
IN A LOW VOICE REMARKS ON THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
HE LOOKED A LITTLE
GRAVE ABOUT WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN ROYD LANE AND SHE TRIED TO SMILE
HIM OUT OF HIS SERIOUSNESS
MISS KEELDAR SAT NEAR FOR A WONDER NEITHER
LAUGHING NOR TALKING ON THE CONTRARY VERY STILL AND GAZING ROUND HER
VIGILANTLY
SHE SEEMED AFRAID LEST SOME INTRUDER SHOULD TAKE A SEAT SHE
APPARENTLY WISHED TO RESERVE NEXT HER OWN
EVER AND ANON SHE SPREAD HER
SATIN DRESS OVER AN UNDUE PORTION OF THE BENCH OR LAID HER GLOVES OR
HER EMBROIDERED HANDKERCHIEF UPON IT
CAROLINE NOTICED THIS MANGE AT
LAST AND ASKED HER WHAT FRIEND SHE EXPECTED
SHIRLEY BENT TOWARDS HER
ALMOST TOUCHED HER EAR WITH HER ROSY LIPS AND WHISPERED WITH A MUSICAL
SOFTNESS THAT OFTEN CHARACTERIZED HER TONES WHEN WHAT SHE SAID TENDED
EVEN REMOTELY TO STIR SOME SWEET SECRET SOURCE OF FEELING IN HER HEART
I EXPECT MR
MOORE
I SAW HIM LAST NIGHT AND I MADE HIM PROMISE TO
COME WITH HIS SISTER AND TO SIT AT OUR TABLE
HE WON'T FAIL ME I FEEL
CERTAIN BUT I APPREHEND HIS COMING TOO LATE AND BEING SEPARATED FROM
US
HERE IS A FRESH BATCH ARRIVING EVERY PLACE WILL BE TAKEN
PROVOKING
IN FACT MR
WYNNE THE MAGISTRATE HIS WIFE HIS SON AND HIS TWO
DAUGHTERS NOW ENTERED IN HIGH STATE
THEY WERE BRIARFIELD GENTRY
OF
COURSE THEIR PLACE WAS AT THE FIRST TABLE AND BEING CONDUCTED THITHER
THEY FILLED UP THE WHOLE REMAINING SPACE
FOR MISS KEELDAR'S COMFORT
MR
SAM WYNNE INDUCTED HIMSELF INTO THE VERY VACANCY SHE HAD KEPT FOR
MOORE PLANTING HIMSELF SOLIDLY ON HER GOWN HER GLOVES AND HER
HANDKERCHIEF
MR
SAM WAS ONE OF THE OBJECTS OF HER AVERSION AND THE
MORE SO BECAUSE HE SHOWED SERIOUS SYMPTOMS OF AN AIM AT HER HAND
THE
OLD GENTLEMAN TOO HAD PUBLICLY DECLARED THAT THE FIELDHEAD ESTATE AND
THE DE WALDEN ESTATE WERE DELIGHTFULLY CONTAGIOUS A MALAPROPISM WHICH
RUMOUR HAD NOT FAILED TO REPEAT TO SHIRLEY
CAROLINE'S EARS YET RUNG WITH THAT THRILLING WHISPER I EXPECT MR
MOORE HER HEART YET BEAT AND HER CHEEK YET GLOWED WITH IT WHEN A NOTE
FROM THE ORGAN PEALED ABOVE THE CONFUSED HUM OF THE PLACE
DR
BOULTBY
MR
HELSTONE AND MR
HALL ROSE SO DID ALL PRESENT AND GRACE WAS SUNG
TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE MUSIC AND THEN TEA BEGAN
SHE WAS KEPT TOO
BUSY WITH HER OFFICE FOR A WHILE TO HAVE LEISURE FOR LOOKING ROUND BUT
THE LAST CUP BEING FILLED SHE THREW A RESTLESS GLANCE OVER THE ROOM
THERE WERE SOME LADIES AND SEVERAL GENTLEMEN STANDING ABOUT YET
UNACCOMMODATED WITH SEATS
AMIDST A GROUP SHE RECOGNIZED HER SPINSTER
FRIEND MISS MANN WHOM THE FINE WEATHER HAD TEMPTED OR SOME URGENT
FRIEND HAD PERSUADED TO LEAVE HER DREAR SOLITUDE FOR ONE HOUR OF SOCIAL
ENJOYMENT
MISS MANN LOOKED TIRED OF STANDING A LADY IN A YELLOW BONNET
BROUGHT HER A CHAIR
CAROLINE KNEW WELL THAT CHAPEAU EN SATIN JAUNE
SHE KNEW THE BLACK HAIR AND THE KINDLY THOUGH RATHER OPINIONATED AND
FROWARD LOOKING FACE UNDER IT SHE KNEW THAT ROBE DE SOIE NOIRE SHE
KNEW EVEN THAT SCHALL GRIS DE LIN SHE KNEW IN SHORT HORTENSE MOORE
AND SHE WANTED TO JUMP UP AND RUN TO HER AND KISS HER TO GIVE HER ONE
EMBRACE FOR HER OWN SAKE AND TWO FOR HER BROTHER'S
SHE HALF ROSE
INDEED WITH A SMOTHERED EXCLAMATION AND PERHAPS FOR THE IMPULSE WAS
VERY STRONG SHE WOULD HAVE RUN ACROSS THE ROOM AND ACTUALLY SALUTED
HER BUT A HAND REPLACED HER IN HER SEAT AND A VOICE BEHIND HER
WHISPERED WAIT TILL AFTER TEA LINA AND THEN I'LL BRING HER TO YOU
AND WHEN SHE COULD LOOK UP SHE DID AND THERE WAS ROBERT HIMSELF CLOSE
BEHIND SMILING AT HER EAGERNESS LOOKING BETTER THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN
HIM LOOK LOOKING INDEED TO HER PARTIAL EYES SO VERY HANDSOME THAT
SHE DARED NOT TRUST HERSELF TO HAZARD A SECOND GLANCE FOR HIS IMAGE
STRUCK ON HER VISION WITH PAINFUL BRIGHTNESS AND PICTURED ITSELF ON HER
MEMORY AS VIVIDLY AS IF THERE DAGUERREOTYPED BY A PENCIL OF KEEN
LIGHTNING
HE MOVED ON AND SPOKE TO MISS KEELDAR
SHIRLEY IRRITATED BY SOME
UNWELCOME ATTENTIONS FROM SAM WYNNE AND BY THE FACT OF THAT GENTLEMAN
BEING STILL SEATED ON HER GLOVES AND HANDKERCHIEF AND PROBABLY ALSO
BY MOORE'S WANT OF PUNCTUALITY WAS BY NO MEANS IN GOOD HUMOUR
SHE
FIRST SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AT HIM AND THEN SHE SAID A BITTER WORD OR
TWO ABOUT HIS INSUPPORTABLE TARDINESS MOORE NEITHER APOLOGIZED NOR
RETORTED
HE STOOD NEAR HER QUIETLY AS IF WAITING TO SEE WHETHER SHE
WOULD RECOVER HER TEMPER WHICH SHE DID IN LITTLE MORE THAN THREE
MINUTES INDICATING THE CHANGE BY OFFERING HIM HER HAND
MOORE TOOK IT
WITH A SMILE HALF CORRECTIVE HALF GRATEFUL
THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE
SHAKE OF THE HEAD DELICATELY MARKED THE FORMER QUALITY IT IS PROBABLE A
GENTLE PRESSURE INDICATED THE LATTER
YOU MAY SIT WHERE YOU CAN NOW MR
MOORE SAID SHIRLEY ALSO SMILING
YOU SEE THERE IS NOT AN INCH OF ROOM FOR YOU HERE BUT I DISCERN PLENTY
OF SPACE AT MRS
BOULTBY'S TABLE BETWEEN MISS ARMITAGE AND MISS
BIRTWHISTLE
GO JOHN SYKES WILL BE YOUR VIS VIS AND YOU WILL SIT
WITH YOUR BACK TOWARDS US
MOORE HOWEVER PREFERRED LINGERING ABOUT WHERE HE WAS
HE NOW AND THEN
TOOK A TURN DOWN THE LONG ROOM PAUSING IN HIS WALK TO INTERCHANGE
GREETINGS WITH OTHER GENTLEMEN IN HIS OWN PLACELESS PREDICAMENT BUT
STILL HE CAME BACK TO THE MAGNET SHIRLEY BRINGING WITH HIM EACH TIME
HE RETURNED OBSERVATIONS IT WAS NECESSARY TO WHISPER IN HER EAR
MEANTIME POOR SAM WYNNE LOOKED FAR FROM COMFORTABLE
HIS FAIR NEIGHBOUR
JUDGING FROM HER MOVEMENTS APPEARED IN A MOOD THE MOST UNQUIET AND
UNACCOMMODATING
SHE WOULD NOT SIT STILL TWO SECONDS
SHE WAS HOT SHE
FANNED HERSELF COMPLAINED OF WANT OF AIR AND SPACE
SHE REMARKED THAT
IN HER OPINION WHEN PEOPLE HAD FINISHED THEIR TEA THEY OUGHT TO LEAVE
THE TABLES AND ANNOUNCED DISTINCTLY THAT SHE EXPECTED TO FAINT IF THE
PRESENT STATE OF THINGS CONTINUED
MR
SAM OFFERED TO ACCOMPANY HER INTO
THE OPEN AIR JUST THE WAY TO GIVE HER HER DEATH OF COLD SHE ALLEGED
IN SHORT HIS POST BECAME UNTENABLE AND HAVING SWALLOWED HIS QUANTUM OF
TEA HE JUDGED IT EXPEDIENT TO EVACUATE
MOORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT HAND WHEREAS HE WAS QUITE AT THE OTHER
EXTREMITY OF THE ROOM DEEP IN CONFERENCE WITH CHRISTOPHER SYKES
A
LARGE CORN FACTOR TIMOTHY RAMSDEN ESQ HAPPENED TO BE NEARER AND
FEELING HIMSELF TIRED OF STANDING HE ADVANCED TO FILL THE VACANT SEAT
SHIRLEY'S EXPEDIENTS DID NOT FAIL HER
A SWEEP OF HER SCARF UPSET HER
TEACUP ITS CONTENTS WERE SHARED BETWEEN THE BENCH AND HER OWN SATIN
DRESS
OF COURSE IT BECAME NECESSARY TO CALL A WAITER TO REMEDY THE
MISCHIEF
MR
RAMSDEN A STOUT PUFFY GENTLEMAN AS LARGE IN PERSON AS
HE WAS IN PROPERTY HELD ALOOF FROM THE CONSEQUENT COMMOTION
SHIRLEY
USUALLY ALMOST CULPABLY INDIFFERENT TO SLIGHT ACCIDENTS AFFECTING DRESS
ETC NOW MADE A COMMOTION THAT MIGHT HAVE BECOME THE MOST DELICATE AND
NERVOUS OF HER SEX
MR
RAMSDEN OPENED HIS MOUTH WITHDREW SLOWLY AND
AS MISS KEELDAR AGAIN INTIMATED HER INTENTION TO GIVE WAY AND SWOON ON
THE SPOT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND BEAT A HEAVY RETREAT
MOORE AT LAST RETURNED
CALMLY SURVEYING THE BUSTLE AND SOMEWHAT
QUIZZICALLY SCANNING SHIRLEY'S ENIGMATICAL LOOKING COUNTENANCE HE
REMARKED THAT IN TRUTH THIS WAS THE HOTTEST END OF THE ROOM THAT HE
FOUND A CLIMATE THERE CALCULATED TO AGREE WITH NONE BUT COOL
TEMPERAMENTS LIKE HIS OWN AND PUTTING THE WAITERS THE NAPKINS THE
SATIN ROBE THE WHOLE TURMOIL IN SHORT TO ONE SIDE HE INSTALLED
HIMSELF WHERE DESTINY EVIDENTLY DECREED HE SHOULD SIT
SHIRLEY SUBSIDED
HER FEATURES ALTERED THEIR LINES THE RAISED KNIT BROW AND INEXPLICABLE
CURVE OF THE MOUTH BECAME STRAIGHT AGAIN WILFULNESS AND ROGUERY GAVE
PLACE TO OTHER EXPRESSIONS AND ALL THE ANGULAR MOVEMENTS WITH WHICH SHE
HAD VEXED THE SOUL OF SAM WYNNE WERE CONJURED TO REST AS BY A CHARM
STILL NO GRACIOUS GLANCE WAS CAST ON MOORE
ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS
ACCUSED OF GIVING HER A WORLD OF TROUBLE AND ROUNDLY CHARGED WITH BEING
THE CAUSE OF DEPRIVING HER OF THE ESTEEM OF MR
RAMSDEN AND THE
INVALUABLE FRIENDSHIP OF MR
SAMUEL WYNNE
WOULDN'T HAVE OFFENDED EITHER GENTLEMAN FOR THE WORLD SHE AVERRED
I
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TREAT BOTH WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL
CONSIDERATION AND THERE OWING TO YOU HOW THEY HAVE BEEN USED I SHALL
NOT BE HAPPY TILL I HAVE MADE IT UP
I NEVER AM HAPPY TILL I AM FRIENDS
WITH MY NEIGHBOURS
SO TO MORROW I MUST MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO ROYD
CORN MILL SOOTHE THE MILLER AND PRAISE THE GRAIN AND NEXT DAY I MUST
CALL AT DE WALDEN WHERE I HATE TO GO AND CARRY IN MY RETICULE HALF AN
OATCAKE TO GIVE TO MR
SAM'S FAVOURITE POINTERS
YOU KNOW THE SUREST PATH TO THE HEART OF EACH SWAIN I DOUBT NOT SAID
MOORE QUIETLY
HE LOOKED VERY CONTENT TO HAVE AT LAST SECURED HIS
PRESENT PLACE BUT HE MADE NO FINE SPEECH EXPRESSIVE OF GRATIFICATION
AND OFFERED NO APOLOGY FOR THE TROUBLE HE HAD GIVEN
HIS PHLEGM BECAME
HIM WONDERFULLY
IT MADE HIM LOOK HANDSOMER HE WAS SO COMPOSED IT MADE
HIS VICINAGE PLEASANT IT WAS SO PEACE RESTORING
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE
THOUGHT TO LOOK AT HIM THAT HE WAS A POOR STRUGGLING MAN SEATED
BESIDE A RICH WOMAN THE CALM OF EQUALITY STILLED HIS ASPECT PERHAPS
THAT CALM TOO REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
NOW AND THEN FROM THE WAY IN WHICH
HE LOOKED DOWN ON MISS KEELDAR AS HE ADDRESSED HER YOU WOULD HAVE
FANCIED HIS STATION TOWERED ABOVE HERS AS MUCH AS HIS STATURE DID
ALMOST STERN LIGHTS SOMETIMES CROSSED HIS BROW AND GLEAMED IN HIS EYES
THEIR CONVERSATION HAD BECOME ANIMATED THOUGH IT WAS CONFINED TO A LOW
KEY SHE WAS URGING HIM WITH QUESTIONS EVIDENTLY HE REFUSED TO HER
CURIOSITY ALL THE GRATIFICATION IT DEMANDED
SHE SOUGHT HIS EYE ONCE
WITH HERS
YOU READ IN ITS SOFT YET EAGER EXPRESSION THAT IT SOLICITED
CLEARER REPLIES
MOORE SMILED PLEASANTLY BUT HIS LIPS CONTINUED SEALED
THEN SHE WAS PIQUED AND TURNED AWAY BUT HE RECALLED HER ATTENTION IN
TWO MINUTES
HE SEEMED MAKING PROMISES WHICH HE SOOTHED HER INTO
ACCEPTING IN LIEU OF INFORMATION
IT APPEARED THAT THE HEAT OF THE ROOM DID NOT SUIT MISS HELSTONE
SHE
GREW PALER AND PALER AS THE PROCESS OF TEA MAKING WAS PROTRACTED
THE
MOMENT THANKS WERE RETURNED SHE QUITTED THE TABLE AND HASTENED TO
FOLLOW HER COUSIN HORTENSE WHO WITH MISS MANN HAD ALREADY SOUGHT THE
OPEN AIR
ROBERT MOORE HAD RISEN WHEN SHE DID PERHAPS HE MEANT TO SPEAK
TO HER BUT THERE WAS YET A PARTING WORD TO EXCHANGE WITH MISS KEELDAR
AND WHILE IT WAS BEING UTTERED CAROLINE HAD VANISHED
HORTENSE RECEIVED HER FORMER PUPIL WITH A DEMEANOUR OF MORE DIGNITY THAN
WARMTH
SHE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY OFFENDED BY MR
HELSTONE'S PROCEEDINGS
AND HAD ALL ALONG CONSIDERED CAROLINE TO BLAME IN OBEYING HER UNCLE TOO
LITERALLY
YOU ARE A VERY GREAT STRANGER SHE SAID AUSTERELY AS HER PUPIL HELD
AND PRESSED HER HAND
THE PUPIL KNEW HER TOO WELL TO REMONSTRATE OR
COMPLAIN OF COLDNESS
SHE LET THE PUNCTILIOUS WHIM PASS SURE THAT HER
NATURAL BONT I USE THIS FRENCH WORD BECAUSE IT EXPRESSES JUST WHAT I
MEAN NEITHER GOODNESS NOR GOOD NATURE BUT SOMETHING BETWEEN THE TWO
WOULD PRESENTLY GET THE UPPER HAND
IT DID
HORTENSE HAD NO SOONER
EXAMINED HER FACE WELL AND OBSERVED THE CHANGE ITS SOMEWHAT WASTED
FEATURES BETRAYED THAN HER MIEN SOFTENED
KISSING HER ON BOTH CHEEKS
SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY AFTER HER HEALTH
CAROLINE ANSWERED GAILY
IT WOULD
HOWEVER HAVE BEEN HER LOT TO UNDERGO A LONG CROSS EXAMINATION FOLLOWED
BY AN ENDLESS LECTURE ON THIS HEAD HAD NOT MISS MANN CALLED OFF THE
ATTENTION OF THE QUESTIONER BY REQUESTING TO BE CONDUCTED HOME
THE POOR
INVALID WAS ALREADY FATIGUED
HER WEARINESS MADE HER CROSS TOO CROSS
ALMOST TO SPEAK TO CAROLINE AND BESIDES THAT YOUNG PERSON'S WHITE
DRESS AND LIVELY LOOK WERE DISPLEASING IN THE EYES OF MISS MANN
THE
EVERYDAY GARB OF BROWN STUFF OR GRAY GINGHAM AND THE EVERYDAY AIR OF
MELANCHOLY SUITED THE SOLITARY SPINSTER BETTER SHE WOULD HARDLY KNOW
HER YOUNG FRIEND TO NIGHT AND QUITTED HER WITH A COOL NOD
HORTENSE
HAVING PROMISED TO ACCOMPANY HER HOME THEY DEPARTED TOGETHER
CAROLINE NOW LOOKED ROUND FOR SHIRLEY
SHE SAW THE RAINBOW SCARF AND
PURPLE DRESS IN THE CENTRE OF A THRONG OF LADIES ALL WELL KNOWN TO
HERSELF BUT ALL OF THE ORDER WHOM SHE SYSTEMATICALLY AVOIDED WHENEVER
AVOIDANCE WAS POSSIBLE
SHYER AT SOME MOMENTS THAN AT OTHERS SHE FELT
JUST NOW NO COURAGE AT ALL TO JOIN THIS COMPANY
SHE COULD NOT HOWEVER
STAND ALONE WHERE ALL OTHERS WENT IN PAIRS OR PARTIES SO SHE APPROACHED
A GROUP OF HER OWN SCHOLARS GREAT GIRLS OR RATHER YOUNG WOMEN WHO
WERE STANDING WATCHING SOME HUNDREDS OF THE YOUNGER CHILDREN PLAYING AT
BLIND MAN'S BUFF
MISS HELSTONE KNEW THESE GIRLS LIKED HER YET SHE WAS SHY EVEN WITH THEM
OUT OF SCHOOL
THEY WERE NOT MORE IN AWE OF HER THAN SHE OF THEM
SHE
DREW NEAR THEM NOW RATHER TO FIND PROTECTION IN THEIR COMPANY THAN TO
PATRONIZE THEM WITH HER PRESENCE
BY SOME INSTINCT THEY KNEW HER
WEAKNESS AND WITH NATURAL POLITENESS THEY RESPECTED IT
HER KNOWLEDGE
COMMANDED THEIR ESTEEM WHEN SHE TAUGHT THEM HER GENTLENESS ATTRACTED
THEIR REGARD AND BECAUSE SHE WAS WHAT THEY CONSIDERED WISE AND GOOD
WHEN ON DUTY THEY KINDLY OVERLOOKED HER EVIDENT TIMIDITY WHEN OFF
THEY DID NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT
PEASANT GIRLS AS THEY WERE THEY HAD
TOO MUCH OF OUR OWN ENGLISH SENSIBILITY TO BE GUILTY OF THE COARSE
ERROR
THEY STOOD ROUND HER STILL CIVIL FRIENDLY RECEIVING HER SLIGHT
SMILES AND RATHER HURRIED EFFORTS TO CONVERSE WITH A GOOD FEELING AND
GOOD BREEDING THE LAST QUALITY BEING THE RESULT OF THE FIRST WHICH
SOON SET HER AT HER EASE
MR
SAM WYNNE COMING UP WITH GREAT HASTE TO INSIST ON THE ELDER GIRLS
JOINING IN THE GAME AS WELL AS THE YOUNGER ONES CAROLINE WAS AGAIN LEFT
ALONE
SHE WAS MEDITATING A QUIET RETREAT TO THE HOUSE WHEN SHIRLEY
PERCEIVING FROM AFAR HER ISOLATION HASTENED TO HER SIDE
LET US GO TO THE TOP OF THE FIELDS SHE SAID
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE
CROWDS CAROLINE
BUT IT WILL BE DEPRIVING YOU OF A PLEASURE SHIRLEY TO TAKE YOU FROM
ALL THESE FINE PEOPLE WHO COURT YOUR SOCIETY SO ASSIDUOUSLY AND TO
WHOM YOU CAN WITHOUT ART OR EFFORT MAKE YOURSELF SO PLEASANT
NOT QUITE WITHOUT EFFORT I AM ALREADY TIRED OF THE EXERTION
IT IS BUT
INSIPID BARREN WORK TALKING AND LAUGHING WITH THE GOOD GENTLEFOLKS OF
BRIARFIELD
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR WHITE DRESS FOR THE LAST
TEN MINUTES
I LIKE TO WATCH THOSE I LOVE IN A CROWD AND TO COMPARE
THEM WITH OTHERS
I HAVE THUS COMPARED YOU
YOU RESEMBLE NONE OF THE
REST LINA
THERE ARE SOME PRETTIER FACES THAN YOURS HERE
YOU ARE NOT A
MODEL BEAUTY LIKE HARRIET SYKES FOR INSTANCE BESIDE HER YOUR PERSON
APPEARS ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT BUT YOU LOOK AGREEABLE YOU LOOK
REFLECTIVE YOU LOOK WHAT I CALL INTERESTING
HUSH SHIRLEY YOU FLATTER ME
I DON'T WONDER THAT YOUR SCHOLARS LIKE YOU
NONSENSE SHIRLEY TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
WE WILL TALK OF MOORE THEN AND WE WILL WATCH HIM
I SEE HIM EVEN
NOW
WHERE AND AS CAROLINE ASKED THE QUESTION SHE LOOKED NOT OVER THE
FIELDS BUT INTO MISS KEELDAR'S EYES AS WAS HER WONT WHENEVER SHIRLEY
MENTIONED ANY OBJECT SHE DESCRIED AFAR
HER FRIEND HAD QUICKER VISION
THAN HERSELF AND CAROLINE SEEMED TO THINK THAT THE SECRET OF HER EAGLE
ACUTENESS MIGHT BE READ IN HER DARK GRAY IRIDES OR RATHER PERHAPS SHE
ONLY SOUGHT GUIDANCE BY THE DIRECTION OF THOSE DISCRIMINATING AND
BRILLIANT SPHERES
THERE IS MOORE SAID SHIRLEY POINTING RIGHT ACROSS THE WIDE FIELD
WHERE A THOUSAND CHILDREN WERE PLAYING AND NOW NEARLY A THOUSAND ADULT
SPECTATORS WALKING ABOUT
THERE CAN YOU MISS THE TALL STATURE AND
STRAIGHT PORT HE LOOKS AMIDST THE SET THAT SURROUND HIM LIKE ELIAB
AMONGST HUMBLER SHEPHERDS LIKE SAUL IN A WAR COUNCIL AND A WAR COUNCIL
IT IS IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN
WHY SO SHIRLEY ASKED CAROLINE WHOSE EYE HAD AT LAST CAUGHT THE
OBJECT IT SOUGHT
ROBERT IS JUST NOW SPEAKING TO MY UNCLE AND THEY ARE
SHAKING HANDS
THEY ARE THEN RECONCILED
RECONCILED NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON DEPEND ON IT MAKING COMMON CAUSE
AGAINST SOME COMMON FOE
AND WHY THINK YOU ARE MESSRS
WYNNE AND
SYKES AND ARMITAGE AND RAMSDEN GATHERED IN SUCH A CLOSE CIRCLE ROUND
THEM AND WHY IS MALONE BECKONED TO JOIN THEM WHERE HE IS SUMMONED
BE SURE A STRONG ARM IS NEEDED
SHIRLEY AS SHE WATCHED GREW RESTLESS HER EYES FLASHED
THEY WON'T TRUST ME SHE SAID
THAT IS ALWAYS THE WAY WHEN IT COMES
TO THE POINT
WHAT ABOUT
CANNOT YOU FEEL THERE IS SOME MYSTERY AFLOAT SOME EVENT IS EXPECTED
SOME PREPARATION IS TO BE MADE I AM CERTAIN
I SAW IT ALL IN MR
MOORE'S MANNER THIS EVENING
HE WAS EXCITED YET HARD
HARD TO YOU SHIRLEY
YES TO ME
HE OFTEN IS HARD TO ME
WE SELDOM CONVERSE TTE TTE
BUT I AM MADE TO FEEL THAT THE BASIS OF HIS CHARACTER IS NOT OF EIDER
DOWN
YET HE SEEMED TO TALK TO YOU SOFTLY
DID HE NOT VERY GENTLE TONES AND QUIET MANNER
YET THE MAN IS
PEREMPTORY AND SECRET HIS SECRECY VEXES ME
YES ROBERT IS SECRET
WHICH HE HAS SCARCELY A RIGHT TO BE WITH ME ESPECIALLY AS HE COMMENCED
BY GIVING ME HIS CONFIDENCE
HAVING DONE NOTHING TO FORFEIT THAT
CONFIDENCE IT OUGHT NOT TO BE WITHDRAWN BUT I SUPPOSE I AM NOT
CONSIDERED IRON SOULED ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED IN A CRISIS
HE FEARS PROBABLY TO OCCASION YOU UNEASINESS
AN UNNECESSARY PRECAUTION
I AM OF ELASTIC MATERIALS NOT SOON CRUSHED
HE OUGHT TO KNOW THAT
BUT THE MAN IS PROUD
HE HAS HIS FAULTS SAY WHAT
YOU WILL LINA
OBSERVE HOW ENGAGED THAT GROUP APPEAR
THEY DO NOT KNOW
WE ARE WATCHING THEM
IF WE KEEP ON THE ALERT SHIRLEY WE SHALL PERHAPS FIND THE CLUE TO
THEIR SECRET
THERE WILL BE SOME UNUSUAL MOVEMENTS ERE LONG PERHAPS TO MORROW
POSSIBLY TO NIGHT
BUT MY EYES AND EARS ARE WIDE OPEN
MR
MOORE YOU
SHALL BE UNDER SURVEILLANCE
BE YOU VIGILANT ALSO LINA
I WILL
ROBERT IS GOING I SAW HIM TURN
I BELIEVE HE NOTICED US
THEY
ARE SHAKING HANDS
SHAKING HANDS WITH EMPHASIS ADDED SHIRLEY AS IF THEY WERE
RATIFYING SOME SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT
THEY SAW ROBERT QUIT THE GROUP PASS THROUGH A GATE AND DISAPPEAR
AND HE HAS NOT BID US GOOD BYE MURMURED CAROLINE
SCARCELY HAD THE WORDS ESCAPED HER LIPS WHEN SHE TRIED BY A SMILE TO
DENY THE CONFESSION OF DISAPPOINTMENT THEY SEEMED TO IMPLY
AN UNBIDDEN
SUFFUSION FOR ONE MOMENT BOTH SOFTENED AND BRIGHTENED HER EYES
OH THAT IS SOON REMEDIED EXCLAIMED SHIRLEY WE'LL MAKE HIM BID US
GOOD BYE
MAKE HIM THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING WAS THE ANSWER
IT SHALL BE THE SAME THING
BUT HE IS GONE YOU CAN'T OVERTAKE HIM
I KNOW A SHORTER WAY THAN THAT HE HAS TAKEN
WE WILL INTERCEPT HIM
BUT SHIRLEY I WOULD RATHER NOT GO
CAROLINE SAID THIS AS MISS KEELDAR SEIZED HER ARM AND HURRIED HER DOWN
THE FIELDS
IT WAS VAIN TO CONTEND
NOTHING WAS SO WILFUL AS SHIRLEY
WHEN SHE TOOK A WHIM INTO HER HEAD
CAROLINE FOUND HERSELF OUT OF SIGHT
OF THE CROWD ALMOST BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE AND USHERED INTO A NARROW
SHADY SPOT EMBOWERED ABOVE WITH HAWTHORNS AND ENAMELLED UNDER FOOT
WITH DAISIES
SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE EVENING SUN CHEQUERING THE TURF
NOR WAS SHE SENSIBLE OF THE PURE INCENSE EXHALING AT THIS HOUR FROM TREE
AND PLANT SHE ONLY HEARD THE WICKET OPENING AT ONE END AND KNEW ROBERT
WAS APPROACHING
THE LONG SPRAYS OF THE HAWTHORNS SHOOTING OUT BEFORE
THEM SERVED AS A SCREEN
THEY SAW HIM BEFORE HE OBSERVED THEM
AT A
GLANCE CAROLINE PERCEIVED THAT HIS SOCIAL HILARITY WAS GONE HE HAD LEFT
IT BEHIND HIM IN THE JOY ECHOING FIELDS ROUND THE SCHOOL
WHAT REMAINED
NOW WAS HIS DARK QUIET BUSINESS COUNTENANCE
AS SHIRLEY HAD SAID A
CERTAIN HARDNESS CHARACTERIZED HIS AIR WHILE HIS EYE WAS EXCITED BUT
AUSTERE
SO MUCH THE WORSE TIMED WAS THE PRESENT FREAK OF SHIRLEY'S
IF
HE HAD LOOKED DISPOSED FOR HOLIDAY MIRTH IT WOULD NOT HAVE MATTERED
MUCH BUT NOW
I TOLD YOU NOT TO COME SAID CAROLINE SOMEWHAT BITTERLY TO HER
FRIEND
SHE SEEMED TRULY PERTURBED
TO BE INTRUDED ON ROBERT THUS
AGAINST HER WILL AND HIS EXPECTATION AND WHEN HE EVIDENTLY WOULD RATHER
NOT BE DELAYED KEENLY ANNOYED HER
IT DID NOT ANNOY MISS KEELDAR IN THE
LEAST
SHE STEPPED FORWARD AND FACED HER TENANT BARRING HIS WAY
YOU
OMITTED TO BID US GOOD BYE SHE SAID
OMITTED TO BID YOU GOOD BYE WHERE DID YOU COME FROM ARE YOU FAIRIES
I LEFT TWO LIKE YOU ONE IN PURPLE AND ONE IN WHITE STANDING AT THE TOP
OF A BANK FOUR FIELDS OFF BUT A MINUTE AGO
YOU LEFT US THERE AND FIND US HERE
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU AND
SHALL WATCH YOU STILL
YOU MUST BE QUESTIONED ONE DAY BUT NOT NOW
AT
PRESENT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO SAY GOOD NIGHT AND THEN PASS
MOORE GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WITHOUT UNBENDING HIS ASPECT
DAYS
OF FTE HAVE THEIR PRIVILEGES AND SO HAVE DAYS OF HAZARD OBSERVED HE
GRAVELY
COME DON'T MORALIZE
SAY GOOD NIGHT AND PASS URGED SHIRLEY
MUST I SAY GOOD NIGHT TO YOU MISS KEELDAR
YES AND TO CAROLINE LIKEWISE
IT IS NOTHING NEW I HOPE
YOU HAVE BID
US BOTH GOOD NIGHT BEFORE
HE TOOK HER HAND HELD IT IN ONE OF HIS AND COVERED IT WITH THE OTHER
HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER GRAVELY KINDLY YET COMMANDINGLY
THE HEIRESS
COULD NOT MAKE THIS MAN HER SUBJECT
IN HIS GAZE ON HER BRIGHT FACE
THERE WAS NO SERVILITY HARDLY HOMAGE BUT THERE WERE INTEREST AND
AFFECTION HEIGHTENED BY ANOTHER FEELING
SOMETHING IN HIS TONE WHEN HE
SPOKE AS WELL AS IN HIS WORDS MARKED THAT LAST SENTIMENT TO BE
GRATITUDE
YOUR DEBTOR BIDS YOU GOOD NIGHT MAY YOU REST SAFELY AND SERENELY TILL
MORNING
AND YOU MR
MOORE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SAYING
TO MR
HELSTONE WITH WHOM I SAW YOU SHAKE HANDS WHY DID ALL THOSE
GENTLEMEN GATHER ROUND YOU PUT AWAY RESERVE FOR ONCE
BE FRANK WITH
ME
WHO CAN RESIST YOU I WILL BE FRANK
TO MORROW IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO
RELATE YOU SHALL HEAR IT
JUST NOW PLEADED SHIRLEY DON'T PROCRASTINATE
BUT I COULD ONLY TELL HALF A TALE
AND MY TIME IS LIMITED I HAVE NOT A
MOMENT TO SPARE
HEREAFTER I WILL MAKE AMENDS FOR DELAY BY CANDOUR
BUT ARE YOU GOING HOME
YES
NOT TO LEAVE IT ANY MORE TO NIGHT
CERTAINLY NOT
AT PRESENT FAREWELL TO BOTH OF YOU
HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN CAROLINE'S HAND AND JOINED IT IN THE SAME CLASP IN
WHICH HE HELD SHIRLEY'S BUT SOMEHOW IT WAS NOT READY FOR HIM
SHE HAD
WITHDRAWN A FEW STEPS APART
HER ANSWER TO MOORE'S ADIEU WAS ONLY A
SLIGHT BEND OF THE HEAD AND A GENTLE SERIOUS SMILE
HE SOUGHT NO MORE
CORDIAL TOKEN
AGAIN HE SAID FAREWELL AND QUITTED THEM BOTH
THERE IT IS OVER SAID SHIRLEY WHEN HE WAS GONE
WE HAVE MADE HIM
BID US GOOD NIGHT AND YET NOT LOST GROUND IN HIS ESTEEM I THINK
CARY
I HOPE NOT WAS THE BRIEF REPLY
I CONSIDER YOU VERY TIMID AND UNDEMONSTRATIVE REMARKED MISS KEELDAR
WHY DID YOU NOT GIVE MOORE YOUR HAND WHEN HE OFFERED YOU HIS HE IS
YOUR COUSIN YOU LIKE HIM
ARE YOU ASHAMED TO LET HIM PERCEIVE YOUR
AFFECTION
HE PERCEIVES ALL OF IT THAT INTERESTS HIM
NO NEED TO MAKE A DISPLAY OF
FEELING
YOU ARE LACONIC YOU WOULD BE STOICAL IF YOU COULD
IS LOVE IN YOUR
EYES A CRIME CAROLINE
LOVE A CRIME NO SHIRLEY LOVE IS A DIVINE VIRTUE
BUT WHY DRAG THAT
WORD INTO THE CONVERSATION IT IS SINGULARLY IRRELEVANT
GOOD PRONOUNCED SHIRLEY
THE TWO GIRLS PACED THE GREEN LANE IN SILENCE
CAROLINE FIRST RESUMED
OBTRUSIVENESS IS A CRIME FORWARDNESS IS A CRIME AND BOTH DISGUST BUT
LOVE NO PUREST ANGEL NEED BLUSH TO LOVE
AND WHEN I SEE OR HEAR EITHER
MAN OR WOMAN COUPLE SHAME WITH LOVE I KNOW THEIR MINDS ARE COARSE
THEIR ASSOCIATIONS DEBASED
MANY WHO THINK THEMSELVES REFINED LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN AND ON WHOSE LIPS THE WORD 'VULGARITY' IS FOR EVER HOVERING
CANNOT MENTION 'LOVE' WITHOUT BETRAYING THEIR OWN INNATE AND IMBECILE
DEGRADATION
IT IS A LOW FEELING IN THEIR ESTIMATION CONNECTED ONLY
WITH LOW IDEAS FOR THEM
YOU DESCRIBE THREE FOURTHS OF THE WORLD CAROLINE
THEY ARE COLD THEY ARE COWARDLY THEY ARE STUPID ON THE SUBJECT
SHIRLEY THEY NEVER LOVED THEY NEVER WERE LOVED
THOU ART RIGHT LINA
AND IN THEIR DENSE IGNORANCE THEY BLASPHEME
LIVING FIRE SERAPH BROUGHT FROM A DIVINE ALTAR
THEY CONFOUND IT WITH SPARKS MOUNTING FROM TOPHET
THE SUDDEN AND JOYOUS CLASH OF BELLS HERE STOPPED THE DIALOGUE BY
SUMMONING ALL TO THE CHURCH
CHAPTER XVIII
WHICH THE GENTEEL READER IS RECOMMENDED TO SKIP LOW PERSONS BEING HERE
INTRODUCED
THE EVENING WAS STILL AND WARM CLOSE AND SULTRY IT EVEN PROMISED TO
BECOME
ROUND THE DESCENDING SUN THE CLOUDS GLOWED PURPLE SUMMER TINTS
RATHER INDIAN THAN ENGLISH SUFFUSED THE HORIZON AND CAST ROSY
REFLECTIONS ON HILLSIDE HOUSE FRONT TREE BOLE ON WINDING ROAD AND
UNDULATING PASTURE GROUND
THE TWO GIRLS CAME DOWN FROM THE FIELDS
SLOWLY
BY THE TIME THEY REACHED THE CHURCHYARD THE BELLS WERE HUSHED
THE MULTITUDES WERE GATHERED INTO THE CHURCH
THE WHOLE SCENE WAS
SOLITARY
HOW PLEASANT AND CALM IT IS SAID CAROLINE
AND HOW HOT IT WILL BE IN THE CHURCH RESPONDED SHIRLEY
AND WHAT A
DREARY LONG SPEECH DR
BOULTBY WILL MAKE AND HOW THE CURATES WILL
HAMMER OVER THEIR PREPARED ORATIONS FOR MY PART I WOULD RATHER NOT
ENTER
BUT MY UNCLE WILL BE ANGRY IF HE OBSERVES OUR ABSENCE
I WILL BEAR THE BRUNT OF HIS WRATH HE WILL NOT DEVOUR ME
I SHALL BE
SORRY TO MISS HIS PUNGENT SPEECH
I KNOW IT WILL BE ALL SENSE FOR THE
CHURCH AND ALL CAUSTICITY FOR SCHISM
HE'LL NOT FORGET THE BATTLE OF
ROYD LANE
I SHALL BE SORRY ALSO TO DEPRIVE YOU OF MR
HALL'S SINCERE
FRIENDLY HOMILY WITH ALL ITS RACY YORKSHIREISMS BUT HERE I MUST STAY
THE GRAY CHURCH AND GRAYER TOMBS LOOK DIVINE WITH THIS CRIMSON GLEAM ON
THEM
NATURE IS NOW AT HER EVENING PRAYERS SHE IS KNEELING BEFORE THOSE
RED HILLS
I SEE HER PROSTRATE ON THE GREAT STEPS OF HER ALTAR PRAYING
FOR A FAIR NIGHT FOR MARINERS AT SEA FOR TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS FOR
LAMBS ON MOORS AND UNFLEDGED BIRDS IN WOODS
CAROLINE I SEE HER AND I
WILL TELL YOU WHAT SHE IS LIKE
SHE IS LIKE WHAT EVE WAS WHEN SHE AND
ADAM STOOD ALONE ON EARTH
AND THAT IS NOT MILTON'S EVE SHIRLEY
MILTON'S EVE MILTON'S EVE I REPEAT
NO BY THE PURE MOTHER OF GOD
SHE IS NOT CARY WE ARE ALONE WE MAY SPEAK WHAT WE THINK
MILTON WAS
GREAT BUT WAS HE GOOD HIS BRAIN WAS RIGHT HOW WAS HIS HEART HE SAW
HEAVEN HE LOOKED DOWN ON HELL
HE SAW SATAN AND SIN HIS DAUGHTER AND
DEATH THEIR HORRIBLE OFFSPRING
ANGELS SERRIED BEFORE HIM THEIR
BATTALIONS THE LONG LINES OF ADAMANTINE SHIELDS FLASHED BACK ON HIS
BLIND EYEBALLS THE UNUTTERABLE SPLENDOUR OF HEAVEN
DEVILS GATHERED
THEIR LEGIONS IN HIS SIGHT THEIR DIM DISCROWNED AND TARNISHED ARMIES
PASSED RANK AND FILE BEFORE HIM
MILTON TRIED TO SEE THE FIRST WOMAN
BUT CARY HE SAW HER NOT
YOU ARE BOLD TO SAY SO SHIRLEY
NOT MORE BOLD THAN FAITHFUL
IT WAS HIS COOK THAT HE SAW OR IT WAS
MRS
GILL AS I HAVE SEEN HER MAKING CUSTARDS IN THE HEAT OF SUMMER
IN THE COOL DAIRY WITH ROSE TREES AND NASTURTIUMS ABOUT THE LATTICED
WINDOW PREPARING A COLD COLLATION FOR THE RECTORS PRESERVES AND
'DULCET CREAMS PUZZLED 'WHAT CHOICE TO CHOOSE FOR DELICACY BEST WHAT
ORDER SO CONTRIVED AS NOT TO MIX TASTES NOT WELL JOINED INELEGANT BUT
BRING TASTE AFTER TASTE UPHELD WITH KINDLIEST CHANGE
ALL VERY WELL TOO SHIRLEY
I WOULD BEG TO REMIND HIM THAT THE FIRST MEN OF THE EARTH WERE TITANS
AND THAT EVE WAS THEIR MOTHER FROM HER SPRANG SATURN HYPERION
OCEANUS SHE BORE PROMETHEUS
PAGAN THAT YOU ARE WHAT DOES THAT SIGNIFY
I SAY THERE WERE GIANTS ON THE EARTH IN THOSE DAYS GIANTS THAT STROVE
TO SCALE HEAVEN
THE FIRST WOMAN'S BREAST THAT HEAVED WITH LIFE ON THIS
WORLD YIELDED THE DARING WHICH COULD CONTEND WITH OMNIPOTENCE THE
STRENGTH WHICH COULD BEAR A THOUSAND YEARS OF BONDAGE THE VITALITY
WHICH COULD FEED THAT VULTURE DEATH THROUGH UNCOUNTED AGES THE
UNEXHAUSTED LIFE AND UNCORRUPTED EXCELLENCE SISTERS TO IMMORTALITY
WHICH AFTER MILLENNIUMS OF CRIMES STRUGGLES AND WOES COULD CONCEIVE
AND BRING FORTH A MESSIAH
THE FIRST WOMAN WAS HEAVEN BORN
VAST WAS THE
HEART WHENCE GUSHED THE WELL SPRING OF THE BLOOD OF NATIONS AND GRAND
THE UNDEGENERATE HEAD WHERE RESTED THE CONSORT CROWN OF CREATION
SHE COVETED AN APPLE AND WAS CHEATED BY A SNAKE BUT YOU HAVE GOT SUCH
A HASH OF SCRIPTURE AND MYTHOLOGY INTO YOUR HEAD THAT THERE IS NO MAKING
ANY SENSE OF YOU
YOU HAVE NOT YET TOLD ME WHAT YOU SAW KNEELING ON
THOSE HILLS
I SAW I NOW SEE A WOMAN TITAN
HER ROBE OF BLUE AIR SPREADS TO THE
OUTSKIRTS OF THE HEATH WHERE YONDER FLOCK IS GRAZING A VEIL WHITE AS
AN AVALANCHE SWEEPS FROM HER HEAD TO HER FEET AND ARABESQUES OF
LIGHTNING FLAME ON ITS BORDERS
UNDER HER BREAST I SEE HER ZONE PURPLE
LIKE THAT HORIZON THROUGH ITS BLUSH SHINES THE STAR OF EVENING
HER
STEADY EYES I CANNOT PICTURE
THEY ARE CLEAR THEY ARE DEEP AS LAKES
THEY ARE LIFTED AND FULL OF WORSHIP THEY TREMBLE WITH THE SOFTNESS OF
LOVE AND THE LUSTRE OF PRAYER
HER FOREHEAD HAS THE EXPANSE OF A CLOUD
AND IS PALER THAN THE EARLY MOON RISEN LONG BEFORE DARK GATHERS
SHE
RECLINES HER BOSOM ON THE RIDGE OF STILBRO' MOOR HER MIGHTY HANDS ARE
JOINED BENEATH IT
SO KNEELING FACE TO FACE SHE SPEAKS WITH GOD
THAT
EVE IS JEHOVAH'S DAUGHTER AS ADAM WAS HIS SON
SHE IS VERY VAGUE AND VISIONARY
COME SHIRLEY WE OUGHT TO GO INTO
CHURCH
CAROLINE I WILL NOT I WILL STAY OUT HERE WITH MY MOTHER EVE IN THESE
DAYS CALLED NATURE
I LOVE HER UNDYING MIGHTY BEING HEAVEN MAY HAVE
FADED FROM HER BROW WHEN SHE FELL IN PARADISE BUT ALL THAT IS GLORIOUS
ON EARTH SHINES THERE STILL
SHE IS TAKING ME TO HER BOSOM AND SHOWING
ME HER HEART
HUSH CAROLINE YOU WILL SEE HER AND FEEL AS I DO IF WE
ARE BOTH SILENT
I WILL HUMOUR YOUR WHIM BUT YOU WILL BEGIN TALKING AGAIN ERE TEN
MINUTES ARE OVER
MISS KEELDAR ON WHOM THE SOFT EXCITEMENT OF THE WARM SUMMER EVENING
SEEMED WORKING WITH UNWONTED POWER LEANED AGAINST AN UPRIGHT HEADSTONE
SHE FIXED HER EYES ON THE DEEP BURNING WEST AND SANK INTO A PLEASURABLE
TRANCE
CAROLINE GOING A LITTLE APART PACED TO AND FRO BENEATH THE
RECTORY GARDEN WALL DREAMING TOO IN HER WAY
SHIRLEY HAD MENTIONED THE
WORD MOTHER THAT WORD SUGGESTED TO CAROLINE'S IMAGINATION NOT THE
MIGHTY AND MYSTICAL PARENT OF SHIRLEY'S VISIONS BUT A GENTLE HUMAN
FORM THE FORM SHE ASCRIBED TO HER OWN MOTHER UNKNOWN UNLOVED BUT NOT
UNLONGED FOR
OH THAT THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN SHE WOULD REMEMBER HER CHILD OH THAT I
MIGHT KNOW HER AND KNOWING LOVE HER
SUCH WAS HER ASPIRATION
THE LONGING OF HER CHILDHOOD FILLED HER SOUL AGAIN
THE DESIRE WHICH
MANY A NIGHT HAD KEPT HER AWAKE IN HER CRIB AND WHICH FEAR OF ITS
FALLACY HAD OF LATE YEARS ALMOST EXTINGUISHED RELIT SUDDENLY AND
GLOWED WARM IN HER HEART THAT HER MOTHER MIGHT COME SOME HAPPY DAY
AND SEND FOR HER TO HER PRESENCE LOOK UPON HER FONDLY WITH LOVING EYES
AND SAY TO HER TENDERLY IN A SWEET VOICE CAROLINE MY CHILD I HAVE A
HOME FOR YOU YOU SHALL LIVE WITH ME
ALL THE LOVE YOU HAVE NEEDED AND
NOT TASTED FROM INFANCY I HAVE SAVED FOR YOU CAREFULLY
COME IT SHALL
CHERISH YOU NOW
A NOISE ON THE ROAD ROUSED CAROLINE FROM HER FILIAL HOPES AND SHIRLEY
FROM HER TITAN VISIONS
THEY LISTENED AND HEARD THE TRAMP OF HORSES
THEY LOOKED AND SAW A GLITTER THROUGH THE TREES
THEY CAUGHT THROUGH
THE FOLIAGE GLIMPSES OF MARTIAL SCARLET HELM SHONE PLUME WAVED
SILENT
AND ORDERLY SIX SOLDIERS RODE SOFTLY BY
THE SAME WE SAW THIS AFTERNOON WHISPERED SHIRLEY
THEY HAVE BEEN
HALTING SOMEWHERE TILL NOW
THEY WISH TO BE AS LITTLE NOTICED AS
POSSIBLE AND ARE SEEKING THEIR RENDEZVOUS AT THIS QUIET HOUR WHILE THE
PEOPLE ARE AT CHURCH
DID I NOT SAY WE SHOULD SEE UNUSUAL THINGS ERE
LONG
SCARCELY WERE SIGHT AND SOUND OF THE SOLDIERS LOST WHEN ANOTHER AND
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT DISTURBANCE BROKE THE NIGHT HUSH A CHILD'S IMPATIENT
SCREAM
THEY LOOKED
A MAN ISSUED FROM THE CHURCH CARRYING IN HIS ARMS
AN INFANT A ROBUST RUDDY LITTLE BOY OF SOME TWO YEARS OLD ROARING
WITH ALL THE POWER OF HIS LUNGS
HE HAD PROBABLY JUST AWAKED FROM A
CHURCH SLEEP
TWO LITTLE GIRLS OF NINE AND TEN FOLLOWED
THE INFLUENCE
OF THE FRESH AIR AND THE ATTRACTION OF SOME FLOWERS GATHERED FROM A
GRAVE SOON QUIETED THE CHILD
THE MAN SAT DOWN WITH HIM DANDLING HIM
ON HIS KNEE AS TENDERLY AS ANY WOMAN THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS TOOK THEIR
PLACES ONE ON EACH SIDE
GOOD EVENING WILLIAM SAID SHIRLEY AFTER DUE SCRUTINY OF THE MAN
HE
HAD SEEN HER BEFORE AND APPARENTLY WAS WAITING TO BE RECOGNIZED
HE NOW
TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND GRINNED A SMILE OF PLEASURE
HE WAS A
ROUGH HEADED HARD FEATURED PERSONAGE NOT OLD BUT VERY WEATHER BEATEN
HIS ATTIRE WAS DECENT AND CLEAN THAT OF HIS CHILDREN SINGULARLY NEAT
IT WAS OUR OLD FRIEND FARREN
THE YOUNG LADIES APPROACHED HIM
YOU ARE NOT GOING INTO THE CHURCH HE INQUIRED GAZING AT THEM
COMPLACENTLY YET WITH A MIXTURE OF BASHFULNESS IN HIS LOOK A SENTIMENT
NOT BY ANY MEANS THE RESULT OF AWE OF THEIR STATION BUT ONLY OF
APPRECIATION OF THEIR ELEGANCE AND YOUTH
BEFORE GENTLEMEN SUCH AS
MOORE OR HELSTONE FOR INSTANCE WILLIAM WAS OFTEN A LITTLE DOGGED
WITH PROUD OR INSOLENT LADIES TOO HE WAS QUITE UNMANAGEABLE SOMETIMES
VERY RESENTFUL BUT HE WAS MOST SENSIBLE OF MOST TRACTABLE TO
GOOD HUMOUR AND CIVILITY
HIS NATURE A STUBBORN ONE WAS REPELLED BY
INFLEXIBILITY IN OTHER NATURES FOR WHICH REASON HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO LIKE HIS FORMER MASTER MOORE AND UNCONSCIOUS OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S
GOOD OPINION OF HIMSELF AND OF THE SERVICE HE HAD SECRETLY RENDERED HIM
IN RECOMMENDING HIM AS GARDENER TO MR
YORKE AND BY THIS MEANS TO OTHER
FAMILIES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HE CONTINUED TO HARBOUR A GRUDGE AGAINST
HIS AUSTERITY
LATTERLY HE HAD OFTEN WORKED AT FIELDHEAD
MISS KEELDAR'S
FRANK HOSPITABLE MANNERS WERE PERFECTLY CHARMING TO HIM
CAROLINE HE
HAD KNOWN FROM HER CHILDHOOD UNCONSCIOUSLY SHE WAS HIS IDEAL OF A LADY
HER GENTLE MIEN STEP GESTURES HER GRACE OF PERSON AND ATTIRE MOVED
SOME ARTIST FIBRES ABOUT HIS PEASANT HEART
HE HAD A PLEASURE IN LOOKING
AT HER AS HE HAD IN EXAMINING RARE FLOWERS OR IN SEEING PLEASANT
LANDSCAPES
BOTH THE LADIES LIKED WILLIAM IT WAS THEIR DELIGHT TO LEND
HIM BOOKS TO GIVE HIM PLANTS AND THEY PREFERRED HIS CONVERSATION FAR
BEFORE THAT OF MANY COARSE HARD PRETENTIOUS PEOPLE IMMEASURABLY HIGHER
IN STATION
WHO WAS SPEAKING WILLIAM WHEN YOU CAME OUT ASKED SHIRLEY
A GENTLEMAN YE SET A DEAL OF STORE ON MISS SHIRLEY MR
DONNE
YOU LOOK KNOWING WILLIAM
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT MY REGARD FOR MR
DONNE
AY MISS SHIRLEY THERE'S A GLEG LIGHT I' YOUR EEN SOMETIMES WHICH
BETRAYS YOU
YOU LOOK RAIGHT DOWN SCORNFUL SOMETIMES WHEN MR
DONNE IS
BY
DO YOU LIKE HIM YOURSELF WILLIAM
ME I'M STALLED O' T' CURATES AND SO IS T' WIFE
THEY'VE NO MANNERS
THEY TALK TO POOR FOLK FAIR AS IF THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE BENEATH THEM
THEY'RE ALLUS MAGNIFYING THEIR OFFICE
IT IS A PITY BUT THEIR OFFICE
COULD MAGNIFY THEM BUT IT DOES NOUGHT O' T' SOART
I FAIR HATE PRIDE
BUT YOU ARE PROUD IN YOUR OWN WAY YOURSELF INTERPOSED CAROLINE
YOU
ARE WHAT YOU CALL HOUSE PROUD YOU LIKE TO HAVE EVERYTHING HANDSOME
ABOUT YOU
SOMETIMES YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE ALMOST TOO PROUD TO TAKE
YOUR WAGES
WHEN YOU WERE OUT OF WORK YOU WERE TOO PROUD TO GET
ANYTHING ON CREDIT
BUT FOR YOUR CHILDREN I BELIEVE YOU WOULD RATHER
HAVE STARVED THAN GONE TO THE SHOPS WITHOUT MONEY AND WHEN I WANTED TO
GIVE YOU SOMETHING WHAT A DIFFICULTY I HAD IN MAKING YOU TAKE IT
IT IS PARTLY TRUE MISS CAROLINE
ONY DAY I'D RATHER GIVE THAN TAKE
ESPECIALLY FROM SICH AS YE
LOOK AT T' DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US
YE'RE A
LITTLE YOUNG SLENDER LASS AND I'M A GREAT STRONG MAN I'M RATHER MORE
NOR TWICE YOUR AGE
IT IS NOT MY PART THEN I THINK TO TAK FRO'
YE TO BE UNDER OBLIGATIONS AS THEY SAY TO YE
AND THAT DAY YE
CAME TO OUR HOUSE AND CALLED ME TO T' DOOR AND OFFERED ME FIVE
SHILLINGS WHICH I DOUBT YE COULD ILL SPARE FOR YE'VE NO FORTIN' I
KNOW THAT DAY I WAR FAIR A REBEL A RADICAL AN INSURRECTIONIST AND
YE MADE ME SO

T'
CURATES CAN HARDLY BIDE TO SPEAK A CIVIL WORD TO THEM THEY THINK BENEATH
THEM WE CAN HARDLY BIDE TO TAK AN UNCIVIL WORD FRO' THEM THAT THINKS
THEMSELN ABOON US
NOW WILLIAM BE HUMBLE ENOUGH TO TELL ME TRULY HOW YOU ARE GETTING ON
IN THE WORLD

MISS SHIRLEY I AM VARRY WELL OFF
SINCE I GOT INTO T' GARDENING LINE
WI' MR
YORKE'S HELP AND SINCE MR
HALL ANOTHER O' T' RAIGHT SORT
HELPED MY WIFE TO SET UP A BIT OF A SHOP I'VE NOUGHT TO COMPLAIN OF
MY
FAMILY HAS PLENTY TO EAT AND PLENTY TO WEAR
MY PRIDE MAKES ME FIND
MEANS TO HAVE AN ODD POUND NOW AND THEN AGAINST RAINY DAYS FOR I THINK
I'D DIE AFORE I'D COME TO T' PARISH AND ME AND MINE IS CONTENT
BUT T'
NEIGHBOURS IS POOR YET
I SEE A GREAT DEAL OF DISTRESS
AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS STILL DISCONTENT I SUPPOSE INQUIRED MISS
KEELDAR
CONSEQUENTLY YE SAY RIGHT CONSEQUENTLY
IN COURSE STARVING FOLK
CANNOT BE SATISFIED OR SETTLED FOLK
THE COUNTRY'S NOT IN A SAFE
CONDITION I'LL SAY SO MICH
BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE WHAT MORE CAN I DO FOR INSTANCE
DO YE CAN DO NOT MICH POOR YOUNG LASS YE'VE GI'EN YOUR BRASS YE'VE
DONE WELL
IF YE COULD TRANSPORT YOUR TENANT MR
MOORE TO BOTANY BAY
YE'D HAPPEN DO BETTER
FOLKS HATE HIM
WILLIAM FOR SHAME EXCLAIMED CAROLINE WARMLY
IF FOLKS DO HATE
HIM IT IS TO THEIR DISGRACE NOT HIS
MR
MOORE HIMSELF HATES NOBODY
HE ONLY WANTS TO DO HIS DUTY AND MAINTAIN HIS RIGHTS
YOU ARE WRONG TO
TALK SO
I TALK AS I THINK
HE HAS A COLD UNFEELING HEART YOND' MOORE
BUT INTERPOSED SHIRLEY SUPPOSING MOORE WAS DRIVEN FROM THE COUNTRY
AND HIS MILL RAZED TO THE GROUND WOULD PEOPLE HAVE MORE WORK
THEY'D HAVE LESS
I KNOW THAT AND THEY KNOW THAT AND THERE IS MANY AN
HONEST LAD DRIVEN DESPERATE BY THE CERTAINTY THAT WHICHEVER WAY HE TURNS
HE CANNOT BETTER HIMSELF AND THERE IS DISHONEST MEN PLENTY TO GUIDE
THEM TO THE DEVIL SCOUNDRELS THAT RECKONS TO BE THE 'PEOPLE'S FRIENDS
AND THAT KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND IS AS INSINCERE AS LUCIFER
I'VE LIVED ABOON FORTY YEAR IN THE WORLD AND I BELIEVE THAT 'THE
PEOPLE' WILL NEVER HAVE ANY TRUE FRIENDS BUT THEIRSELN AND THEM TWO OR
THREE GOOD FOLK I' DIFFERENT STATIONS THAT IS FRIENDS TO ALL THE WORLD
HUMAN NATUR' TAKING IT I' TH' LUMP IS NOUGHT BUT SELFISHNESS
IT IS
BUT EXCESSIVE FEW IT IS BUT JUST AN EXCEPTION HERE AND THERE NOW AND
THEN SICH AS YE TWO YOUNG UNS AND ME THAT BEING IN A DIFFERENT
SPHERE CAN UNDERSTAND T' ONE T' OTHER AND BE FRIENDS WI'OUT
SLAVISHNESS O' ONE HAND OR PRIDE O' T' OTHER
THEM THAT RECKONS TO BE
FRIENDS TO A LOWER CLASS THAN THEIR OWN FRO' POLITICAL MOTIVES IS NEVER
TO BE TRUSTED THEY ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE THEIR INFERIORS TOOLS
FOR MY OWN
PART I WILL NEITHER BE PATRONIZED NOR MISLED FOR NO MAN'S PLEASURE
I'VE HAD OVERTURES MADE TO ME LATELY THAT I SAW WERE TREACHEROUS AND I
FLUNG 'EM BACK I' THE FACES O' THEM THAT OFFERED 'EM
YOU WON'T TELL US WHAT OVERTURES
I WILL NOT
IT WOULD DO NO GOOD
IT WOULD MAK NO DIFFERENCE
THEM THEY
CONCERNED CAN LOOK AFTER THEIRSELN
AY WE'SE LOOK AFTER WERSELN SAID ANOTHER VOICE
JOE SCOTT HAD
SAUNTERED FORTH FROM THE CHURCH TO GET A BREATH OF FRESH AIR AND THERE
HE STOOD
I'LL WARRANT YE JOE OBSERVED WILLIAM SMILING
AND I'LL WARRANT MY MAISTER WAS THE ANSWER YOUNG LADIES
CONTINUED JOE ASSUMING A LORDLY AIR YE'D BETTER GO INTO TH' HOUSE
I WONDER WHAT FOR INQUIRED SHIRLEY TO WHOM THE OVERLOOKER'S SOMEWHAT
PRAGMATICAL MANNERS WERE FAMILIAR AND WHO WAS OFTEN AT WAR WITH HIM
FOR JOE HOLDING SUPERCILIOUS THEORIES ABOUT WOMEN IN GENERAL RESENTED
GREATLY IN HIS SECRET SOUL THE FACT OF HIS MASTER AND HIS MASTER'S
MILL BEING IN A MANNER UNDER PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT AND HAD FELT AS
WORMWOOD AND GALL CERTAIN BUSINESS VISITS OF THE HEIRESS TO THE HOLLOW'S
COUNTING HOUSE
BECAUSE THERE IS NOUGHT AGATE THAT FITS WOMEN TO BE CONSARNED IN
INDEED THERE IS PRAYER AND PREACHING AGATE IN THAT CHURCH
ARE WE NOT
CONCERNED IN THAT
YE HAVE BEEN PRESENT NEITHER AT THE PRAYER NOR PREACHING MA'AM IF I
HAVE OBSERVED ARIGHT
WHAT I ALLUDED TO WAS POLITICS
WILLIAM FARREN
HERE WAS TOUCHING ON THAT SUBJECT IF I'M NOT MISTA'EN
WELL WHAT THEN POLITICS ARE OUR HABITUAL STUDY JOE
DO YOU KNOW I
SEE A NEWSPAPER EVERY DAY AND TWO OF A SUNDAY
I SHOULD THINK YOU'LL READ THE MARRIAGES PROBABLY MISS AND THE
MURDERS AND THE ACCIDENTS AND SICH LIKE
I READ THE LEADING ARTICLES JOE AND THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE AND I
LOOK OVER THE MARKET PRICES
IN SHORT I READ JUST WHAT GENTLEMEN READ
JOE LOOKED AS IF HE THOUGHT THIS TALK WAS LIKE THE CHATTERING OF A PIE
HE REPLIED TO IT BY A DISDAINFUL SILENCE
JOE CONTINUED MISS KEELDAR I NEVER YET COULD ASCERTAIN PROPERLY
WHETHER YOU ARE A WHIG OR A TORY
PRAY WHICH PARTY HAS THE HONOUR OF
YOUR ALLIANCE
IT IS RAYTHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN WHERE YOU ARE SURE NOT TO BE
UNDERSTOOD WAS JOE'S HAUGHTY RESPONSE BUT AS TO BEING A TORY I'D AS
SOON BE AN OLD WOMAN OR A YOUNG ONE WHICH IS A MORE FLIMSIER ARTICLE
STILL
IT IS THE TORIES THAT CARRIES ON THE WAR AND RUINS TRADE AND IF
I BE OF ANY PARTY THOUGH POLITICAL PARTIES IS ALL NONSENSE I'M OF
THAT WHICH IS MOST FAVOURABLE TO PEACE AND BY CONSEQUENCE TO THE
MERCANTILE INTERESTS OF THIS HERE LAND
SO AM I JOE REPLIED SHIRLEY WHO HAD RATHER A PLEASURE IN TEASING
THE OVERLOOKER BY PERSISTING IN TALKING ON SUBJECTS WITH WHICH HE
OPINED SHE AS A WOMAN HAD NO RIGHT TO MEDDLE PARTLY AT LEAST
I
HAVE RATHER A LEANING TO THE AGRICULTURAL INTEREST TOO AS GOOD REASON
IS SEEING THAT I DON'T DESIRE ENGLAND TO BE UNDER THE FEET OF FRANCE
AND THAT IF A SHARE OF MY INCOME COMES FROM HOLLOW'S MILL A LARGER
SHARE COMES FROM THE LANDED ESTATE AROUND IT
IT WOULD NOT DO TO TAKE
ANY MEASURES INJURIOUS TO THE FARMERS JOE I THINK
THE DEWS AT THIS HOUR IS UNWHOLESOME FOR FEMALES OBSERVED JOE
IF YOU MAKE THAT REMARK OUT OF INTEREST IN ME I HAVE MERELY TO ASSURE
YOU THAT I AM IMPERVIOUS TO COLD
I SHOULD NOT MIND TAKING MY TURN TO
WATCH THE MILL ONE OF THESE SUMMER NIGHTS ARMED WITH YOUR MUSKET JOE
JOE SCOTT'S CHIN WAS ALWAYS RATHER PROMINENT
HE POKED IT OUT AT THIS
SPEECH SOME INCHES FARTHER THAN USUAL
BUT TO GO BACK TO MY SHEEP SHE PROCEEDED CLOTHIER AND MILL OWNER
AS I AM BESIDES FARMER I CANNOT GET OUT OF MY HEAD A CERTAIN IDEA THAT
WE MANUFACTURERS AND PERSONS OF BUSINESS ARE SOMETIMES A LITTLE A VERY
LITTLE SELFISH AND SHORT SIGHTED IN OUR VIEWS AND RATHER TOO
REGARDLESS OF HUMAN SUFFERING RATHER HEARTLESS IN OUR PURSUIT OF GAIN
DON'T YOU AGREE WITH ME JOE
I CANNOT ARGUE WHERE I CANNOT BE COMPREHENDED WAS AGAIN THE ANSWER
MAN OF MYSTERY YOUR MASTER WILL ARGUE WITH ME SOMETIMES JOE
HE IS
NOT SO STIFF AS YOU ARE
MAYBE NOT
WE'VE ALL OUR OWN WAYS
JOE DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK ALL THE WISDOM IN THE WORLD IS LODGED IN
MALE SKULLS
I THINK THAT WOMEN ARE A KITTLE AND A FROWARD GENERATION AND I'VE A
GREAT RESPECT FOR THE DOCTRINES DELIVERED IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF ST
PAUL'S FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY
WHAT DOCTRINES JOE
'LET THE WOMAN LEARN IN SILENCE WITH ALL SUBJECTION
I SUFFER NOT A
WOMAN TO TEACH NOR TO USURP AUTHORITY OVER THE MAN BUT TO BE IN
SILENCE
FOR ADAM WAS FIRST FORMED THEN EVE
WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH THE BUSINESS INTERJECTED SHIRLEY
THAT
SMACKS OF RIGHTS OF PRIMOGENITURE
I'LL BRING IT UP TO MR
YORKE THE
FIRST TIME HE INVEIGHS AGAINST THOSE RIGHTS
AND CONTINUED JOE SCOTT ADAM WAS NOT DECEIVED BUT THE WOMAN BEING
DECEIVED WAS IN THE TRANSGRESSION
MORE SHAME TO ADAM TO SIN WITH HIS EYES OPEN CRIED MISS KEELDAR
TO
CONFESS THE HONEST TRUTH JOE I NEVER WAS EASY IN MY MIND CONCERNING
THAT CHAPTER
IT PUZZLES ME
IT IS VERY PLAIN MISS
HE THAT RUNS MAY READ
HE MAY READ IT IN HIS OWN FASHION REMARKED CAROLINE NOW JOINING IN
THE DIALOGUE FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU ALLOW THE RIGHT OF PRIVATE
JUDGMENT I SUPPOSE JOE
MY CERTY THAT I DO I ALLOW AND CLAIM IT FOR EVERY LINE OF THE HOLY
BOOK
WOMEN MAY EXERCISE IT AS WELL AS MEN
NAY
WOMEN IS TO TAKE THEIR HUSBANDS' OPINION BOTH IN POLITICS AND
RELIGION
IT'S WHOLESOMEST FOR THEM
OH OH EXCLAIMED BOTH SHIRLEY AND CAROLINE
TO BE SURE NO DOUBT ON'T PERSISTED THE STUBBORN OVERLOOKER
CONSIDER YOURSELF GROANED DOWN AND CRIED SHAME OVER FOR SUCH A STUPID
OBSERVATION SAID MISS KEELDAR
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY MEN ARE TO TAKE
THE OPINIONS OF THEIR PRIESTS WITHOUT EXAMINATION
OF WHAT VALUE WOULD A
RELIGION SO ADOPTED BE IT WOULD BE MERE BLIND BESOTTED SUPERSTITION
AND WHAT IS YOUR READING MISS HELSTONE O' THESE WORDS O' ST
PAUL'S
HEM I I ACCOUNT FOR THEM IN THIS WAY
HE WROTE THAT CHAPTER FOR A
PARTICULAR CONGREGATION OF CHRISTIANS UNDER PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND
BESIDES I DARE SAY IF I COULD READ THE ORIGINAL GREEK I SHOULD FIND
THAT MANY OF THE WORDS HAVE BEEN WRONGLY TRANSLATED PERHAPS
MISAPPREHENDED ALTOGETHER
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE I DOUBT NOT WITH A
LITTLE INGENUITY TO GIVE THE PASSAGE QUITE A CONTRARY TURN TO MAKE IT
SAY 'LET THE WOMAN SPEAK OUT WHENEVER SHE SEES FIT TO MAKE AN
OBJECTION 'IT IS PERMITTED TO A WOMAN TO TEACH AND TO EXERCISE
AUTHORITY AS MUCH AS MAY BE
MAN MEANTIME CANNOT DO BETTER THAN HOLD
HIS PEACE AND SO ON
THAT WILLN'T WASH MISS
I DARE SAY IT WILL
MY NOTIONS ARE DYED IN FASTER COLOURS THAN YOURS
JOE
MR
SCOTT YOU ARE A THOROUGHLY DOGMATICAL PERSON AND ALWAYS
WERE
I LIKE WILLIAM BETTER THAN YOU
JOE IS WELL ENOUGH IN HIS OWN HOUSE SAID SHIRLEY
I HAVE SEEN HIM AS
QUIET AS A LAMB AT HOME
THERE IS NOT A BETTER NOR A KINDER HUSBAND IN
BRIARFIELD
HE DOES NOT DOGMATIZE TO HIS WIFE
MY WIFE IS A HARD WORKING PLAIN WOMAN TIME AND TROUBLE HAS TA'EN ALL
THE CONCEIT OUT OF HER
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH YOU YOUNG MISSES
AND THEN YOU RECKON TO HAVE SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE AND I' MY THOUGHTS IT'S
ONLY SUPERFICIAL SORT O' VANITIES YOU'RE ACQUAINTED WITH
I CAN
TELL HAPPEN A YEAR SIN' ONE DAY MISS CAROLINE COMING INTO OUR
COUNTING HOUSE WHEN I WAR PACKING UP SUMMAT BEHIND T' GREAT DESK AND
SHE DIDN'T SEE ME AND SHE BROUGHT A SLATE WI' A SUM ON IT TO T'
MAISTER
IT WAR ONLY A BIT OF A SUM IN PRACTICE THAT OUR HARRY WOULD
HAVE SETTLED I' TWO MINUTES
SHE COULDN'T DO IT
MR
MOORE HAD TO SHOW
HER HOW
AND WHEN HE DID SHOW HER SHE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HIM
NONSENSE JOE
NAY IT'S NO NONSENSE
AND MISS SHIRLEY THERE RECKONS TO HEARKEN TO T'
MAISTER WHEN HE'S TALKING OWER TRADE SO ATTENTIVE LIKE AS IF SHE
FOLLOWED HIM WORD FOR WORD AND ALL WAR AS CLEAR AS A LADY'S
LOOKING GLASS TO HER EEN AND ALL T' WHILE SHE'S PEEPING AND PEEPING OUT
O' T' WINDOW TO SEE IF T' MARE STANDS QUIET AND THEN LOOKING AT A BIT
OF A SPLASH ON HER RIDING SKIRT AND THEN GLANCING GLEGLY ROUND AT WER
COUNTING HOUSE COBWEBS AND DUST AND THINKING WHAT MUCKY FOLK WE ARE
AND WHAT A GRAND RIDE SHE'LL HAVE JUST I' NOW OWER NUNNELY COMMON
SHE
HEARS NO MORE O' MR
MOORE'S TALK NOR IF HE SPAKE HEBREW
JOE YOU ARE A REAL SLANDERER
I WOULD GIVE YOU YOUR ANSWER ONLY THE
PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT OF CHURCH
WE MUST LEAVE YOU
MAN OF PREJUDICE
GOOD BYE WILLIAM GOOD BYE CHILDREN COME UP TO FIELDHEAD TO MORROW
AND YOU SHALL CHOOSE WHAT YOU LIKE BEST OUT OF MRS
GILL'S STORE ROOM
CHAPTER XIX
A SUMMER NIGHT
THE HOUR WAS NOW THAT OF DUSK

STARS

KEELDAR AS SHE PREPARED TO TAKE LEAVE OF CAROLINE AT THE RECTORY GARDEN
DOOR
YOU MUST NOT GO ALONE SHIRLEY FANNY SHALL ACCOMPANY YOU
THAT SHE SHALL NOT
OF WHAT NEED I BE AFRAID IN MY OWN PARISH I WOULD
WALK FROM FIELDHEAD TO THE CHURCH ANY FINE MIDSUMMER NIGHT THREE HOURS
LATER THAN THIS FOR THE MERE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE STARS AND THE
CHANCE OF MEETING A FAIRY

GOOD BYE SO WE WILL STEP INTO THE GARDEN AND TAKE SHELTER AMONGST THE
LABURNUMS FOR AN INSTANT
THE RECTORS THEIR CURATES AND THEIR CHURCHWARDENS NOW ISSUED FROM THE
CHURCH PORCH
THERE WAS A GREAT CONFABULATION SHAKING OF HANDS
CONGRATULATION ON SPEECHES RECOMMENDATION TO BE CAREFUL OF THE NIGHT
AIR ETC
BY DEGREES THE THRONG DISPERSED THE CARRIAGES DROVE OFF
MISS
KEELDAR WAS JUST EMERGING FROM HER FLOWERY REFUGE WHEN MR
HELSTONE
ENTERED THE GARDEN AND MET HER
OH I WANT YOU HE SAID
I WAS AFRAID YOU WERE ALREADY
GONE CAROLINE COME HERE
CAROLINE CAME EXPECTING AS SHIRLEY DID A LECTURE ON NOT HAVING BEEN
VISIBLE AT CHURCH
OTHER SUBJECTS HOWEVER OCCUPIED THE RECTOR'S MIND
I SHALL NOT SLEEP AT HOME TO NIGHT HE CONTINUED
I HAVE JUST MET
WITH AN OLD FRIEND AND PROMISED TO ACCOMPANY HIM
I SHALL RETURN
PROBABLY ABOUT NOON TO MORROW
THOMAS THE CLERK IS ENGAGED AND I
CANNOT GET HIM TO SLEEP IN THE HOUSE AS I USUALLY DO WHEN I AM ABSENT
FOR A NIGHT
NOW
NOW INTERRUPTED SHIRLEY YOU WANT ME AS A GENTLEMAN THE FIRST
GENTLEMAN IN BRIARFIELD IN SHORT TO SUPPLY YOUR PLACE BE MASTER OF
THE RECTORY AND GUARDIAN OF YOUR NIECE AND MAIDS WHILE YOU ARE AWAY
EXACTLY CAPTAIN
I THOUGHT THE POST WOULD SUIT YOU

CAROLINE SO FAR AS TO BE HER GUEST FOR ONE NIGHT WILL YOU STAY HERE
INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO FIELDHEAD
AND WHAT WILL MRS
PRYOR DO SHE EXPECTS ME HOME
I WILL SEND HER WORD
COME MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO STAY
IT GROWS LATE
THE DEW FALLS HEAVILY
YOU AND CAROLINE WILL ENJOY EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY
I DOUBT NOT
I PROMISE YOU THEN TO STAY WITH CAROLINE REPLIED SHIRLEY
AS YOU
SAY WE SHALL ENJOY EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY
WE WILL NOT BE SEPARATED
TO NIGHT
NOW REJOIN YOUR OLD FRIEND AND FEAR NOTHING FOR US
IF THERE SHOULD CHANCE TO BE ANY DISTURBANCE IN THE NIGHT CAPTAIN IF
YOU SHOULD HEAR THE PICKING OF A LOCK THE CUTTING OUT OF A PANE OF
GLASS A STEALTHY TREAD OF STEPS ABOUT THE HOUSE AND I NEED NOT FEAR TO
TELL YOU WHO BEAR A WELL TEMPERED METTLESOME HEART UNDER YOUR GIRL'S
RIBBON SASH THAT SUCH LITTLE INCIDENTS ARE VERY POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT
TIME WHAT WOULD YOU DO
DON'T KNOW FAINT PERHAPS FALL DOWN AND HAVE TO BE PICKED UP AGAIN
BUT DOCTOR IF YOU ASSIGN ME THE POST OF HONOUR YOU MUST GIVE ME ARMS
WHAT WEAPONS ARE THERE IN YOUR STRONGHOLD
YOU COULD NOT WIELD A SWORD
NO I COULD MANAGE THE CARVING KNIFE BETTER
YOU WILL FIND A GOOD ONE IN THE DINING ROOM SIDEBOARD A LADY'S KNIFE
LIGHT TO HANDLE AND AS SHARP POINTED AS A PONIARD
IT WILL SUIT CAROLINE
BUT YOU MUST GIVE ME A BRACE OF PISTOLS
I KNOW
YOU HAVE PISTOLS
I HAVE TWO PAIRS
ONE PAIR I CAN PLACE AT YOUR DISPOSAL
YOU WILL FIND
THEM SUSPENDED OVER THE MANTELPIECE OF MY STUDY IN CLOTH CASES
LOADED
YES BUT NOT ON THE COCK
COCK THEM BEFORE YOU GO TO BED
IT IS PAYING
YOU A GREAT COMPLIMENT CAPTAIN TO LEND YOU THESE
WERE YOU ONE OF THE
AWKWARD SQUAD YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM
I WILL TAKE CARE
YOU NEED DELAY NO LONGER MR
HELSTONE
YOU MAY GO
NOW HE IS GRACIOUS TO ME TO LEND ME HIS PISTOLS SHE REMARKED AS THE
RECTOR PASSED OUT AT THE GARDEN GATE
BUT COME LINA SHE CONTINUED
LET US GO IN AND HAVE SOME SUPPER
I WAS TOO MUCH VEXED AT TEA WITH THE
VICINAGE OF MR
SAM WYNNE TO BE ABLE TO EAT AND NOW I AM REALLY
HUNGRY
ENTERING THE HOUSE THEY REPAIRED TO THE DARKENED DINING ROOM THROUGH
THE OPEN WINDOWS OF WHICH APARTMENT STOLE THE EVENING AIR BEARING THE
PERFUME OF FLOWERS FROM THE GARDEN THE VERY DISTANT SOUND OF
FAR RETREATING STEPS FROM THE ROAD AND A SOFT VAGUE MURMUR WHOSE
ORIGIN CAROLINE EXPLAINED BY THE REMARK UTTERED AS SHE STOOD LISTENING
AT THE CASEMENT SHIRLEY I HEAR THE BECK IN THE HOLLOW
THEN SHE RANG THE BELL ASKED FOR A CANDLE AND SOME BREAD AND MILK MISS
KEELDAR'S USUAL SUPPER AND HER OWN
FANNY WHEN SHE BROUGHT IN THE TRAY
WOULD HAVE CLOSED THE WINDOWS AND THE SHUTTERS BUT WAS REQUESTED TO
DESIST FOR THE PRESENT
THE TWILIGHT WAS TOO CALM ITS BREATH TOO BALMY
TO BE YET EXCLUDED
THEY TOOK THEIR MEAL IN SILENCE
CAROLINE ROSE ONCE
TO REMOVE TO THE WINDOW SILL A GLASS OF FLOWERS WHICH STOOD ON THE
SIDEBOARD THE EXHALATION FROM THE BLOSSOMS BEING SOMEWHAT TOO POWERFUL
FOR THE SULTRY ROOM
IN RETURNING SHE HALF OPENED A DRAWER AND TOOK
FROM IT SOMETHING THAT GLITTERED CLEAR AND KEEN IN HER HAND
YOU ASSIGNED THIS TO ME THEN SHIRLEY DID YOU IT IS BRIGHT
KEEN EDGED FINELY TAPERED IT IS DANGEROUS LOOKING
I NEVER YET FELT
THE IMPULSE WHICH COULD MOVE ME TO DIRECT THIS AGAINST A
FELLOW CREATURE
IT IS DIFFICULT TO FANCY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES COULD NERVE
MY ARM TO STRIKE HOME WITH THIS LONG KNIFE
I SHOULD HATE TO DO IT REPLIED SHIRLEY BUT I THINK I COULD DO IT
IF GOADED BY CERTAIN EXIGENCIES WHICH I CAN IMAGINE AND MISS KEELDAR
QUIETLY SIPPED HER GLASS OF NEW MILK LOOKING SOMEWHAT THOUGHTFUL AND A
LITTLE PALE THOUGH INDEED WHEN DID SHE NOT LOOK PALE SHE WAS NEVER
FLORID
THE MILK SIPPED AND THE BREAD EATEN FANNY WAS AGAIN SUMMONED
SHE AND
ELIZA WERE RECOMMENDED TO GO TO BED WHICH THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO
DO BEING WEARY OF THE DAY'S EXERTIONS OF MUCH CUTTING OF CURRANT BUNS
AND FILLING OF URNS AND TEAPOTS AND RUNNING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
WITH TRAYS
ERE LONG THE MAIDS' CHAMBER DOOR WAS HEARD TO CLOSE
CAROLINE TOOK A CANDLE AND WENT QUIETLY ALL OVER THE HOUSE SEEING THAT
EVERY WINDOW WAS FAST AND EVERY DOOR BARRED
SHE DID NOT EVEN EVADE THE
HAUNTED BACK KITCHEN NOR THE VAULT LIKE CELLARS
THESE VISITED SHE
RETURNED
THERE IS NEITHER SPIRIT NOR FLESH IN THE HOUSE AT PRESENT SHE SAID
WHICH SHOULD NOT BE THERE
IT IS NOW NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK FULLY
BEDTIME YET I WOULD RATHER SIT UP A LITTLE LONGER IF YOU DO NOT
OBJECT SHIRLEY
HERE SHE CONTINUED I HAVE BROUGHT THE BRACE OF
PISTOLS FROM MY UNCLE'S STUDY
YOU MAY EXAMINE THEM AT YOUR LEISURE
SHE PLACED THEM ON THE TABLE BEFORE HER FRIEND
WHY WOULD YOU RATHER SIT UP LONGER ASKED MISS KEELDAR TAKING UP THE
FIREARMS EXAMINING THEM AND AGAIN LAYING THEM DOWN
BECAUSE I HAVE A STRANGE EXCITED FEELING IN MY HEART
SO HAVE I
IS THIS STATE OF SLEEPLESSNESS AND RESTLESSNESS CAUSED BY SOMETHING
ELECTRICAL IN THE AIR I WONDER
NO THE SKY IS CLEAR THE STARS NUMBERLESS
IT IS A FINE NIGHT
BUT VERY STILL
I HEAR THE WATER FRET OVER ITS STONY BED IN HOLLOW'S
COPSE AS DISTINCTLY AS IF IT RAN BELOW THE CHURCHYARD WALL
I AM GLAD IT IS SO STILL A NIGHT
A MOANING WIND OR RUSHING RAIN WOULD
VEX ME TO FEVER JUST NOW
WHY SHIRLEY
BECAUSE IT WOULD BAFFLE MY EFFORTS TO LISTEN
DO YOU LISTEN TOWARDS THE HOLLOW
YES IT IS THE ONLY QUARTER WHENCE WE CAN HEAR A SOUND JUST NOW
THE ONLY ONE SHIRLEY
THEY BOTH SAT NEAR THE WINDOW AND BOTH LEANED THEIR ARMS ON THE SILL
AND BOTH INCLINED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE OPEN LATTICE
THEY SAW EACH
OTHER'S YOUNG FACES BY THE STARLIGHT AND THAT DIM JUNE TWILIGHT WHICH
DOES NOT WHOLLY FADE FROM THE WEST TILL DAWN BEGINS TO BREAK IN THE
EAST
MR
HELSTONE THINKS WE HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WAY HE IS GONE MURMURED
MISS KEELDAR NOR ON WHAT ERRAND NOR WITH WHAT EXPECTATIONS NOR HOW
PREPARED
BUT I GUESS MUCH DO NOT YOU
I GUESS SOMETHING
ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN YOUR COUSIN MOORE INCLUDED THINK THAT YOU AND I
ARE NOW ASLEEP IN OUR BEDS UNCONSCIOUS
CARING NOTHING ABOUT THEM HOPING AND FEARING NOTHING FOR THEM ADDED
CAROLINE
BOTH KEPT SILENT FOR FULL HALF AN HOUR
THE NIGHT WAS SILENT TOO ONLY
THE CHURCH CLOCK MEASURED ITS COURSE BY QUARTERS
SOME WORDS WERE
INTERCHANGED ABOUT THE CHILL OF THE AIR
THEY WRAPPED THEIR SCARVES
CLOSER ROUND THEM RESUMED THEIR BONNETS WHICH THEY HAD REMOVED AND
AGAIN WATCHED
TOWARDS MIDNIGHT THE TEASING MONOTONOUS BARK OF THE HOUSE DOG DISTURBED
THE QUIETUDE OF THEIR VIGIL
CAROLINE ROSE AND MADE HER WAY NOISELESSLY
THROUGH THE DARK PASSAGES TO THE KITCHEN INTENDING TO APPEASE HIM WITH
A PIECE OF BREAD
SHE SUCCEEDED
ON RETURNING TO THE DINING ROOM SHE
FOUND IT ALL DARK MISS KEELDAR HAVING EXTINGUISHED THE CANDLE
THE
OUTLINE OF HER SHAPE WAS VISIBLE NEAR THE STILL OPEN WINDOW LEANING
OUT
MISS HELSTONE ASKED NO QUESTIONS SHE STOLE TO HER SIDE
THE DOG
RECOMMENCED BARKING FURIOUSLY
SUDDENLY HE STOPPED AND SEEMED TO
LISTEN
THE OCCUPANTS OF THE DINING ROOM LISTENED TOO AND NOT MERELY
NOW TO THE FLOW OF THE MILL STREAM
THERE WAS A NEARER THOUGH A
MUFFLED SOUND ON THE ROAD BELOW THE CHURCHYARD A MEASURED BEATING
APPROACHING SOUND A DULL TRAMP OF MARCHING FEET
IT DREW NEAR
THOSE WHO LISTENED BY DEGREES COMPREHENDED ITS EXTENT
IT
WAS NOT THE TREAD OF TWO NOR OF A DOZEN NOR OF A SCORE OF MEN IT WAS
THE TREAD OF HUNDREDS
THEY COULD SEE NOTHING THE HIGH SHRUBS OF THE
GARDEN FORMED A LEAFY SCREEN BETWEEN THEM AND THE ROAD
TO HEAR
HOWEVER WAS NOT ENOUGH AND THIS THEY FELT AS THE TROOP TROD FORWARDS
AND SEEMED ACTUALLY PASSING THE RECTORY
THEY FELT IT MORE WHEN A HUMAN
VOICE THOUGH THAT VOICE SPOKE BUT ONE WORD BROKE THE HUSH OF THE
NIGHT
HALT
A HALT FOLLOWED
THE MARCH WAS ARRESTED
THEN CAME A LOW CONFERENCE OF
WHICH NO WORD WAS DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE DINING ROOM
WE MUST HEAR THIS SAID SHIRLEY
SHE TURNED TOOK HER PISTOLS FROM THE TABLE SILENTLY PASSED OUT THROUGH
THE MIDDLE WINDOW OF THE DINING ROOM WHICH WAS IN FACT A GLASS DOOR
STOLE DOWN THE WALK TO THE GARDEN WALL AND STOOD LISTENING UNDER THE
LILACS
CAROLINE WOULD NOT HAVE QUITTED THE HOUSE HAD SHE BEEN ALONE
BUT WHERE SHIRLEY WENT SHE WOULD GO
SHE GLANCED AT THE WEAPON ON THE
SIDEBOARD BUT LEFT IT BEHIND HER AND PRESENTLY STOOD AT HER FRIEND'S
SIDE
THEY DARED NOT LOOK OVER THE WALL FOR FEAR OF BEING SEEN THEY
WERE OBLIGED TO CROUCH BEHIND IT
THEY HEARD THESE WORDS
IT LOOKS A RAMBLING OLD BUILDING
WHO LIVES IN IT BESIDES THE DAMNED
PARSON
ONLY THREE WOMEN HIS NIECE AND TWO SERVANTS
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY SLEEP
THE LASSES BEHIND THE NIECE IN A FRONT ROOM
AND HELSTONE
YONDER IS HIS CHAMBER
HE WAS BURNING A LIGHT BUT I SEE NONE NOW
WHERE WOULD YOU GET IN
IF I WERE ORDERED TO DO HIS JOB AND HE DESARVES IT I'D TRY YOND' LONG
WINDOW IT OPENS TO THE DINING ROOM
I COULD GROPE MY WAY UPSTAIRS AND
I KNOW HIS CHAMBER
HOW WOULD YOU MANAGE ABOUT THE WOMEN FOLK
LET 'EM ALONE EXCEPT THEY SHRIEKED AND THEN I'D SOON QUIETEN 'EM
I
COULD WISH TO FIND THE OLD CHAP ASLEEP
IF HE WAKED HE'D BE DANGEROUS
HAS HE ARMS
FIREARMS ALLUS AND ALLUS LOADENED
THEN YOU'RE A FOOL TO STOP US HERE
A SHOT WOULD GIVE THE ALARM
MOORE
WOULD BE ON US BEFORE WE COULD TURN ROUND
WE SHOULD MISS OUR MAIN
OBJECT
YOU MIGHT GO ON I TELL YOU
I'D ENGAGE HELSTONE ALONE
A PAUSE
ONE OF THE PARTY DROPPED SOME WEAPON WHICH RANG ON THE STONE
CAUSEWAY
AT THIS SOUND THE RECTORY DOG BARKED AGAIN
FURIOUSLY FIERCELY
THAT SPOILS ALL SAID THE VOICE
HE'LL AWAKE
A NOISE LIKE THAT MIGHT
ROUSE THE DEAD
YOU DID NOT SAY THERE WAS A DOG
DAMN YOU FORWARD
FORWARD THEY WENT TRAMP TRAMP WITH MUSTERING MANIFOLD SLOW FILING
TREAD
THEY WERE GONE
SHIRLEY STOOD ERECT LOOKED OVER THE WALL ALONG THE ROAD
NOT A SOUL REMAINS SHE SAID
SHE STOOD AND MUSED
THANK GOD WAS THE NEXT OBSERVATION
CAROLINE REPEATED THE EJACULATION NOT IN SO STEADY A TONE
SHE WAS
TREMBLING MUCH
HER HEART WAS BEATING FAST AND THICK HER FACE WAS COLD
HER FOREHEAD DAMP
THANK GOD FOR US SHE REITERATED
BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN ELSEWHERE
THEY HAVE PASSED US BY THAT THEY MAY MAKE SURE OF OTHERS
THEY HAVE DONE WELL RETURNED SHIRLEY WITH COMPOSURE
THE OTHERS
WILL DEFEND THEMSELVES
THEY CAN DO IT
THEY ARE PREPARED FOR THEM
WITH
US IT IS OTHERWISE
MY FINGER WAS ON THE TRIGGER OF THIS PISTOL
I WAS
QUITE READY TO GIVE THAT MAN IF HE HAD ENTERED SUCH A GREETING AS HE
LITTLE CALCULATED ON BUT BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED THREE HUNDRED
I HAD
NEITHER THREE HUNDRED HANDS NOR THREE HUNDRED WEAPONS
I COULD NOT HAVE
EFFECTUALLY PROTECTED EITHER YOU MYSELF OR THE TWO POOR WOMEN ASLEEP
UNDER THAT ROOF
THEREFORE I AGAIN EARNESTLY THANK GOD FOR INSULT AND
PERIL ESCAPED
AFTER A SECOND PAUSE SHE CONTINUED WHAT IS IT MY DUTY AND WISDOM TO DO
NEXT NOT TO STAY HERE INACTIVE I AM GLAD TO SAY BUT OF COURSE TO
WALK OVER TO THE HOLLOW
TO THE HOLLOW SHIRLEY
TO THE HOLLOW
WILL YOU GO WITH ME
WHERE THOSE MEN ARE GONE
THEY HAVE TAKEN THE HIGHWAY WE SHOULD NOT ENCOUNTER THEM
THE ROAD
OVER THE FIELDS IS AS SAFE SILENT AND SOLITARY AS A PATH THROUGH THE
AIR WOULD BE
WILL YOU GO
YES WAS THE ANSWER GIVEN MECHANICALLY NOT BECAUSE THE SPEAKER
WISHED OR WAS PREPARED TO GO OR INDEED WAS OTHERWISE THAN SCARED AT
THE PROSPECT OF GOING BUT BECAUSE SHE FELT SHE COULD NOT ABANDON
SHIRLEY
THEN WE MUST FASTEN UP THESE WINDOWS AND LEAVE ALL AS SECURE AS WE CAN
BEHIND US
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING FOR CARY
YES NO BECAUSE YOU WISH IT
IS THAT ALL AND ARE YOU SO OBEDIENT TO A MERE CAPRICE OF MINE WHAT A
DOCILE WIFE YOU WOULD MAKE TO A STERN HUSBAND THE MOON'S FACE IS NOT
WHITER THAN YOURS AT THIS MOMENT AND THE ASPEN AT THE GATE DOES NOT
TREMBLE MORE THAN YOUR BUSY FINGERS AND SO TRACTABLE AND
TERROR STRUCK AND DISMAYED AND DEVOTED YOU WOULD FOLLOW ME INTO THE
THICK OF REAL DANGER CARY LET ME GIVE YOUR FIDELITY A MOTIVE
WE ARE
GOING FOR MOORE'S SAKE TO SEE IF WE CAN BE OF USE TO HIM TO MAKE AN
EFFORT TO WARN HIM OF WHAT IS COMING
TO BE SURE I AM A BLIND WEAK FOOL AND YOU ARE ACUTE AND SENSIBLE
SHIRLEY
I WILL GO WITH YOU I WILL GLADLY GO WITH YOU
I DO NOT DOUBT IT
YOU WOULD DIE BLINDLY AND MEEKLY FOR ME BUT YOU
WOULD INTELLIGENTLY AND GLADLY DIE FOR MOORE
BUT IN TRUTH THERE IS NO
QUESTION OF DEATH TO NIGHT WE RUN NO RISK AT ALL
CAROLINE RAPIDLY CLOSED SHUTTER AND LATTICE
DO NOT FEAR THAT I SHALL
NOT HAVE BREATH TO RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY RUN SHIRLEY
TAKE MY
HAND
LET US GO STRAIGHT ACROSS THE FIELDS
BUT YOU CANNOT CLIMB WALLS
TO NIGHT I CAN
YOU ARE AFRAID OF HEDGES AND THE BECK WHICH WE SHALL BE FORCED TO
CROSS
I CAN CROSS IT
THEY STARTED THEY RAN
MANY A WALL CHECKED BUT DID NOT BAFFLE THEM
SHIRLEY WAS SUREFOOTED AND AGILE SHE COULD SPRING LIKE A DEER WHEN SHE
CHOSE
CAROLINE MORE TIMID AND LESS DEXTEROUS FELL ONCE OR TWICE AND
BRUISED HERSELF BUT SHE ROSE AGAIN DIRECTLY SAYING SHE WAS NOT HURT
A
QUICKSET HEDGE BOUNDED THE LAST FIELD THEY LOST TIME IN SEEKING A GAP
IN IT
THE APERTURE WHEN FOUND WAS NARROW BUT THEY WORKED THEIR WAY
THROUGH
THE LONG HAIR THE TENDER SKIN THE SILKS AND THE MUSLINS
SUFFERED BUT WHAT WAS CHIEFLY REGRETTED WAS THE IMPEDIMENT THIS
DIFFICULTY HAD CAUSED TO SPEED
ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY MET THE BECK
FLOWING DEEP IN A ROUGH BED
AT THIS POINT A NARROW PLANK FORMED THE
ONLY BRIDGE ACROSS IT
SHIRLEY HAD TRODDEN THE PLANK SUCCESSFULLY AND
FEARLESSLY MANY A TIME BEFORE CAROLINE HAD NEVER YET DARED TO RISK THE
TRANSIT
I WILL CARRY YOU ACROSS SAID MISS KEELDAR
YOU ARE LIGHT AND I AM
NOT WEAK
LET ME TRY
IF I FALL IN YOU MAY FISH ME OUT WAS THE ANSWER AS A GRATEFUL
SQUEEZE COMPRESSED HER HAND
CAROLINE WITHOUT PAUSING TROD FORWARD ON
THE TREMBLING PLANK AS IF IT WERE A CONTINUATION OF THE FIRM TURF
SHIRLEY WHO FOLLOWED DID NOT CROSS IT MORE RESOLUTELY OR SAFELY
IN
THEIR PRESENT HUMOUR ON THEIR PRESENT ERRAND A STRONG AND FOAMING
CHANNEL WOULD HAVE BEEN A BARRIER TO NEITHER
AT THE MOMENT THEY WERE
ABOVE THE CONTROL EITHER OF FIRE OR WATER
ALL STILBRO' MOOR ALIGHT AND
AGLOW WITH BONFIRES WOULD NOT HAVE STOPPED THEM NOR WOULD CALDER OR
AIRE THUNDERING IN FLOOD
YET ONE SOUND MADE THEM PAUSE
SCARCE HAD
THEY SET FOOT ON THE SOLID OPPOSITE BANK WHEN A SHOT SPLIT THE AIR FROM
THE NORTH
ONE SECOND ELAPSED
FURTHER OFF BURST A LIKE NOTE IN THE
SOUTH
WITHIN THE SPACE OF THREE MINUTES SIMILAR SIGNALS BOOMED IN THE
EAST AND WEST
I THOUGHT WE WERE DEAD AT THE FIRST EXPLOSION OBSERVED SHIRLEY
DRAWING A LONG BREATH
I FELT MYSELF HIT IN THE TEMPLES AND I
CONCLUDED YOUR HEART WAS PIERCED BUT THE REITERATED VOICE WAS AN
EXPLANATION
THOSE ARE SIGNALS IT IS THEIR WAY THE ATTACK MUST BE
NEAR
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD WINGS
OUR FEET HAVE NOT BORNE US SWIFTLY
ENOUGH
A PORTION OF THE COPSE WAS NOW TO CLEAR
WHEN THEY EMERGED FROM IT THE
MILL LAY JUST BELOW THEM
THEY COULD LOOK DOWN UPON THE BUILDINGS THE
YARD THEY COULD SEE THE ROAD BEYOND
AND THE FIRST GLANCE IN THAT
DIRECTION TOLD SHIRLEY SHE WAS RIGHT IN HER CONJECTURE
THEY WERE
ALREADY TOO LATE TO GIVE WARNING
IT HAD TAKEN MORE TIME THAN THEY
CALCULATED ON TO OVERCOME THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES WHICH EMBARRASSED THE
SHORT CUT ACROSS THE FIELDS
THE ROAD WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN WHITE WAS DARK WITH A MOVING MASS
THE
RIOTERS WERE ASSEMBLED IN FRONT OF THE CLOSED YARD GATES AND A SINGLE
FIGURE STOOD WITHIN APPARENTLY ADDRESSING THEM
THE MILL ITSELF WAS
PERFECTLY BLACK AND STILL
THERE WAS NEITHER LIFE LIGHT NOR MOTION
AROUND IT
SURELY HE IS PREPARED
SURELY THAT IS NOT MOORE MEETING THEM ALONE
WHISPERED SHIRLEY
IT IS
WE MUST GO TO HIM
I WILL GO TO HIM
THAT YOU WILL NOT
WHY DID I COME THEN I CAME ONLY FOR HIM
I SHALL JOIN HIM
FORTUNATELY IT IS OUT OF YOUR POWER
THERE IS NO ENTRANCE TO THE YARD
THERE IS A SMALL ENTRANCE AT THE BACK BESIDES THE GATES IN FRONT
IT
OPENS BY A SECRET METHOD WHICH I KNOW
I WILL TRY IT
NOT WITH MY LEAVE
MISS KEELDAR CLASPED HER ROUND THE WAIST WITH BOTH ARMS AND HELD HER
BACK
NOT ONE STEP SHALL YOU STIR SHE WENT ON AUTHORITATIVELY
AT
THIS MOMENT MOORE WOULD BE BOTH SHOCKED AND EMBARRASSED IF HE SAW EITHER
YOU OR ME
MEN NEVER WANT WOMEN NEAR THEM IN TIME OF REAL DANGER
I WOULD NOT TROUBLE I WOULD HELP HIM WAS THE REPLY
HOW BY INSPIRING HIM WITH HEROISM POOH THESE ARE NOT THE DAYS OF
CHIVALRY
IT IS NOT A TILT AT A TOURNAMENT WE ARE GOING TO BEHOLD BUT A
STRUGGLE ABOUT MONEY AND FOOD AND LIFE
IT IS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD BE AT HIS SIDE
AS QUEEN OF HIS HEART HIS MILL IS HIS LADY LOVE CARY BACKED BY HIS
FACTORY AND HIS FRAMES HE HAS ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT HE WANTS OR CAN
KNOW
IT IS NOT FOR LOVE OR BEAUTY BUT FOR LEDGER AND BROADCLOTH HE IS
GOING TO BREAK A SPEAR
DON'T BE SENTIMENTAL ROBERT IS NOT SO
I COULD HELP HIM I WILL SEEK HIM
OFF THEN I LET YOU GO SEEK MOORE
YOU'LL NOT FIND HIM
SHE LOOSENED HER HOLD
CAROLINE SPED LIKE LEVELLED SHAFT FROM BENT BOW
AFTER HER RANG A JESTING GIBING LAUGH
LOOK WELL THERE IS NO MISTAKE
WAS THE WARNING GIVEN
BUT THERE WAS A MISTAKE
MISS HELSTONE PAUSED HESITATED GAZED
THE
FIGURE HAD SUDDENLY RETREATED FROM THE GATE AND WAS RUNNING BACK
HASTILY TO THE MILL
MAKE HASTE LINA CRIED SHIRLEY MEET HIM BEFORE HE ENTERS
CAROLINE SLOWLY RETURNED
IT IS NOT ROBERT SHE SAID
IT HAS NEITHER
HIS HEIGHT FORM NOR BEARING
I SAW IT WAS NOT ROBERT WHEN I LET YOU GO
HOW COULD YOU IMAGINE IT IT
IS A SHABBY LITTLE FIGURE OF A PRIVATE SOLDIER THEY HAD POSTED HIM AS
SENTINEL
HE IS SAFE IN THE MILL NOW
I SAW THE DOOR OPEN AND ADMIT HIM
MY MIND GROWS EASIER
ROBERT IS PREPARED
OUR WARNING WOULD HAVE BEEN
SUPERFLUOUS AND NOW I AM THANKFUL WE CAME TOO LATE TO GIVE IT
IT HAS
SAVED US THE TROUBLE OF A SCENE
HOW FINE TO HAVE ENTERED THE
COUNTING HOUSE TOUTE PERDUE AND TO HAVE FOUND ONESELF IN PRESENCE OF
MESSRS
ARMITAGE AND RAMSDEN SMOKING MALONE SWAGGERING YOUR UNCLE
SNEERING MR
SYKES SIPPING A CORDIAL AND MOORE HIMSELF IN HIS COLD
MAN OF BUSINESS VEIN I AM GLAD WE MISSED IT ALL
I WONDER IF THERE ARE MANY IN THE MILL SHIRLEY
PLENTY TO DEFEND IT
THE SOLDIERS WE HAVE TWICE SEEN TO DAY WERE GOING
THERE NO DOUBT AND THE GROUP WE NOTICED SURROUNDING YOUR COUSIN IN THE
FIELDS WILL BE WITH HIM
WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW SHIRLEY WHAT IS THAT NOISE
HATCHETS AND CROWBARS AGAINST THE YARD GATES
THEY ARE FORCING THEM
ARE YOU AFRAID
NO BUT MY HEART THROBS FAST
I HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN STANDING
I WILL
SIT DOWN
DO YOU FEEL UNMOVED
HARDLY THAT BUT I AM GLAD I CAME
WE SHALL SEE WHAT TRANSPIRES WITH
OUR OWN EYES
WE ARE HERE ON THE SPOT AND NONE KNOW IT
INSTEAD OF
AMAZING THE CURATE THE CLOTHIER AND THE CORN DEALER WITH A ROMANTIC
RUSH ON THE STAGE WE STAND ALONE WITH THE FRIENDLY NIGHT ITS MUTE
STARS AND THESE WHISPERING TREES WHOSE REPORT OUR FRIENDS WILL NOT
COME TO GATHER
SHIRLEY SHIRLEY THE GATES ARE DOWN THAT CRASH WAS LIKE THE FELLING
OF GREAT TREES
NOW THEY ARE POURING THROUGH
THEY WILL BREAK DOWN THE
MILL DOORS AS THEY HAVE BROKEN THE GATE
WHAT CAN ROBERT DO AGAINST SO
MANY WOULD TO GOD I WERE A LITTLE NEARER HIM COULD HEAR HIM
SPEAK COULD SPEAK TO HIM WITH MY WILL MY LONGING TO SERVE HIM I
COULD NOT BE A USELESS BURDEN IN HIS WAY I COULD BE TURNED TO SOME
ACCOUNT
THEY COME ON CRIED SHIRLEY
HOW STEADILY THEY MARCH IN THERE IS
DISCIPLINE IN THEIR RANKS
I WILL NOT SAY THERE IS COURAGE HUNDREDS
AGAINST TENS ARE NO PROOF OF THAT QUALITY BUT SHE DROPPED HER VOICE
THERE IS SUFFERING AND DESPERATION ENOUGH AMONGST THEM
THESE GOADS
WILL URGE THEM FORWARDS
FORWARDS AGAINST ROBERT AND THEY HATE HIM
SHIRLEY IS THERE MUCH
DANGER THEY WILL WIN THE DAY
WE SHALL SEE
MOORE AND HELSTONE ARE OF 'EARTH'S FIRST BLOOD' NO
BUNGLERS NO CRAVENS
A CRASH SMASH SHIVER STOPPED THEIR WHISPERS
A SIMULTANEOUSLY HURLED
VOLLEY OF STONES HAD SALUTED THE BROAD FRONT OF THE MILL WITH ALL ITS
WINDOWS AND NOW EVERY PANE OF EVERY LATTICE LAY IN SHATTERED AND
POUNDED FRAGMENTS
A YELL FOLLOWED THIS DEMONSTRATION A RIOTERS'
YELL A NORTH OF ENGLAND A YORKSHIRE A WEST RIDING A
WEST RIDING CLOTHING DISTRICT OF YORKSHIRE RIOTERS' YELL
YOU NEVER HEARD THAT SOUND PERHAPS READER SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR YOUR
EARS PERHAPS FOR YOUR HEART SINCE IF IT RENDS THE AIR IN HATE TO
YOURSELF OR TO THE MEN OR PRINCIPLES YOU APPROVE THE INTERESTS TO
WHICH YOU WISH WELL WRATH WAKENS TO THE CRY OF HATE THE LION SHAKES
HIS MANE AND RISES TO THE HOWL OF THE HYENA CASTE STANDS UP IREFUL
AGAINST CASTE AND THE INDIGNANT WRONGED SPIRIT OF THE MIDDLE RANK
BEARS DOWN IN ZEAL AND SCORN ON THE FAMISHED AND FURIOUS MASS OF THE
OPERATIVE CLASS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO BE TOLERANT DIFFICULT TO BE JUST
IN SUCH MOMENTS
CAROLINE ROSE SHIRLEY PUT HER ARM ROUND HER THEY STOOD TOGETHER AS
STILL AS THE STRAIGHT STEMS OF TWO TREES
THAT YELL WAS A LONG ONE AND
WHEN IT CEASED THE NIGHT WAS YET FULL OF THE SWAYING AND MURMURING OF A
CROWD
WHAT NEXT WAS THE QUESTION OF THE LISTENERS
NOTHING CAME YET
THE
MILL REMAINED MUTE AS A MAUSOLEUM
HE CANNOT BE ALONE WHISPERED CAROLINE
I WOULD STAKE ALL I HAVE THAT HE IS AS LITTLE ALONE AS HE IS ALARMED
RESPONDED SHIRLEY
SHOTS WERE DISCHARGED BY THE RIOTERS
HAD THE DEFENDERS WAITED FOR THIS
SIGNAL IT SEEMED SO
THE HITHERTO INERT AND PASSIVE MILL WOKE FIRE
FLASHED FROM ITS EMPTY WINDOW FRAMES A VOLLEY OF MUSKETRY PEALED SHARP
THROUGH THE HOLLOW
MOORE SPEAKS AT LAST SAID SHIRLEY AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE THE GIFT OF
TONGUES
THAT WAS NOT A SINGLE VOICE
HE HAS BEEN FORBEARING
NO ONE CAN ACCUSE HIM OF RASHNESS ALLEGED
CAROLINE
THEIR DISCHARGE PRECEDED HIS
THEY BROKE HIS GATES AND HIS
WINDOWS
THEY FIRED AT HIS GARRISON BEFORE HE REPELLED THEM
WHAT WAS GOING ON NOW IT SEEMED DIFFICULT IN THE DARKNESS TO
DISTINGUISH BUT SOMETHING TERRIBLE A STILL RENEWING TUMULT WAS
OBVIOUS FIERCE ATTACKS DESPERATE REPULSES
THE MILL YARD THE MILL
ITSELF WAS FULL OF BATTLE MOVEMENT
THERE WAS SCARCELY ANY CESSATION
NOW OF THE DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS AND THERE WAS STRUGGLING RUSHING
TRAMPLING AND SHOUTING BETWEEN
THE AIM OF THE ASSAILANTS SEEMED TO BE
TO ENTER THE MILL THAT OF THE DEFENDERS TO BEAT THEM OFF
THEY HEARD
THE REBEL LEADER CRY TO THE BACK LADS THEY HEARD A VOICE RETORT
COME ROUND WE WILL MEET YOU
TO THE COUNTING HOUSE WAS THE ORDER AGAIN
WELCOME WE SHALL HAVE YOU THERE WAS THE RESPONSE
AND ACCORDINGLY
THE FIERCEST BLAZE THAT HAD YET GLOWED THE LOUDEST RATTLE THAT HAD YET
BEEN HEARD BURST FROM THE COUNTING HOUSE FRONT WHEN THE MASS OF RIOTERS
RUSHED UP TO IT
THE VOICE THAT HAD SPOKEN WAS MOORE'S OWN VOICE
THEY COULD TELL BY ITS
TONES THAT HIS SOUL WAS NOW WARM WITH THE CONFLICT THEY COULD GUESS
THAT THE FIGHTING ANIMAL WAS ROUSED IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE MEN THERE
STRUGGLING TOGETHER AND WAS FOR THE TIME QUITE PARAMOUNT ABOVE THE
RATIONAL HUMAN BEING
BOTH THE GIRLS FELT THEIR FACES GLOW AND THEIR PULSES THROB BOTH KNEW
THEY WOULD DO NO GOOD BY RUSHING DOWN INTO THE MLE
THEY DESIRED
NEITHER TO DEAL NOR TO RECEIVE BLOWS BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE RUN
AWAY CAROLINE NO MORE THAN SHIRLEY THEY COULD NOT HAVE FAINTED THEY
COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THEIR EYES FROM THE DIM TERRIBLE SCENE FROM THE
MASS OF CLOUD OF SMOKE THE MUSKET LIGHTNING FOR THE WORLD
HOW AND WHEN WOULD IT END WAS THE DEMAND THROBBING IN THEIR THROBBING
PULSES
WOULD A JUNCTURE ARISE IN WHICH THEY COULD BE USEFUL WAS WHAT
THEY WAITED TO SEE FOR THOUGH SHIRLEY PUT OFF THEIR TOO LATE ARRIVAL
WITH A JEST AND WAS EVER READY TO SATIRIZE HER OWN OR ANY OTHER
PERSON'S ENTHUSIASM SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A FARM OF HER BEST LAND FOR A
CHANCE OF RENDERING GOOD SERVICE
THE CHANCE WAS NOT VOUCHSAFED HER THE LOOKED FOR JUNCTURE NEVER CAME
IT WAS NOT LIKELY
MOORE HAD EXPECTED THIS ATTACK FOR DAYS PERHAPS
WEEKS HE WAS PREPARED FOR IT AT EVERY POINT
HE HAD FORTIFIED AND
GARRISONED HIS MILL WHICH IN ITSELF WAS A STRONG BUILDING
HE WAS A
COOL BRAVE MAN HE STOOD TO THE DEFENCE WITH UNFLINCHING FIRMNESS
THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM CAUGHT HIS SPIRIT AND COPIED HIS DEMEANOUR
THE
RIOTERS HAD NEVER BEEN SO MET BEFORE
AT OTHER MILLS THEY HAD ATTACKED
THEY HAD FOUND NO RESISTANCE AN ORGANIZED RESOLUTE DEFENCE WAS WHAT
THEY NEVER DREAMED OF ENCOUNTERING
WHEN THEIR LEADERS SAW THE STEADY
FIRE KEPT UP FROM THE MILL WITNESSED THE COMPOSURE AND DETERMINATION OF
ITS OWNER HEARD THEMSELVES COOLLY DEFIED AND INVITED ON TO DEATH AND
BEHELD THEIR MEN FALLING WOUNDED ROUND THEM THEY FELT THAT NOTHING WAS
TO BE DONE HERE
IN HASTE THEY MUSTERED THEIR FORCES DREW THEM AWAY
FROM THE BUILDING
A ROLL WAS CALLED OVER IN WHICH THE MEN ANSWERED TO
FIGURES INSTEAD OF NAMES
THEY DISPERSED WIDE OVER THE FIELDS LEAVING
SILENCE AND RUIN BEHIND THEM
THE ATTACK FROM ITS COMMENCEMENT TO ITS
TERMINATION HAD NOT OCCUPIED AN HOUR
DAY WAS BY THIS TIME APPROACHING THE WEST WAS DIM THE EAST BEGINNING
TO GLEAM
IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED THAT THE GIRLS WHO HAD WATCHED THIS
CONFLICT WOULD NOW WISH TO HASTEN TO THE VICTORS ON WHOSE SIDE ALL
THEIR INTEREST HAD BEEN ENLISTED BUT THEY ONLY VERY CAUTIOUSLY
APPROACHED THE NOW BATTERED MILL AND WHEN SUDDENLY A NUMBER OF SOLDIERS
AND GENTLEMEN APPEARED AT THE GREAT DOOR OPENING INTO THE YARD THEY
QUICKLY STEPPED ASIDE INTO A SHED THE DEPOSIT OF OLD IRON AND TIMBER
WHENCE THEY COULD SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN
IT WAS NO CHEERING SPECTACLE
THESE PREMISES WERE NOW A MERE BLOT OF
DESOLATION ON THE FRESH FRONT OF THE SUMMER DAWN
ALL THE COPSE UP THE
HOLLOW WAS SHADY AND DEWY THE HILL AT ITS HEAD WAS GREEN BUT JUST
HERE IN THE CENTRE OF THE SWEET GLEN DISCORD BROKEN LOOSE IN THE
NIGHT FROM CONTROL HAD BEATEN THE GROUND WITH HIS STAMPING HOOFS AND
LEFT IT WASTE AND PULVERIZED
THE MILL YAWNED ALL RUINOUS WITH UNGLAZED
FRAMES THE YARD WAS THICKLY BESTREWN WITH STONES AND BRICKBATS AND
CLOSE UNDER THE MILL WITH THE GLITTERING FRAGMENTS OF THE SHATTERED
WINDOWS MUSKETS AND OTHER WEAPONS LAY HERE AND THERE
MORE THAN ONE
DEEP CRIMSON STAIN WAS VISIBLE ON THE GRAVEL A HUMAN BODY LAY QUIET ON
ITS FACE NEAR THE GATES AND FIVE OR SIX WOUNDED MEN WRITHED AND MOANED
IN THE BLOODY DUST
MISS KEELDAR'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED AT THIS VIEW
IT WAS THE AFTER TASTE
OF THE BATTLE DEATH AND PAIN REPLACING EXCITEMENT AND EXERTION
IT WAS
THE BLACKNESS THE BRIGHT FIRE LEAVES WHEN ITS BLAZE IS SUNK ITS WARMTH
FAILED AND ITS GLOW FADED
THIS IS WHAT I WISHED TO PREVENT SHE SAID IN A VOICE WHOSE CADENCE
BETRAYED THE ALTERED IMPULSE OF HER HEART
BUT YOU COULD NOT PREVENT IT YOU DID YOUR BEST IT WAS IN VAIN SAID
CAROLINE COMFORTINGLY
DON'T GRIEVE SHIRLEY
I AM SORRY FOR THOSE POOR FELLOWS WAS THE ANSWER WHILE THE SPARK IN
HER GLANCE DISSOLVED TO DEW
ARE ANY WITHIN THE MILL HURT I WONDER IS
THAT YOUR UNCLE
IT IS AND THERE IS MR
MALONE AND O SHIRLEY THERE IS ROBERT
WELL RESUMING HER FORMER TONE DON'T SQUEEZE YOUR FINGERS QUITE
INTO MY HAND
I SEE
THERE IS NOTHING WONDERFUL IN THAT
WE KNEW HE AT
LEAST WAS HERE WHOEVER MIGHT BE ABSENT
HE IS COMING HERE TOWARDS US SHIRLEY
TOWARDS THE PUMP THAT IS TO SAY FOR THE PURPOSE OF WASHING HIS HANDS
AND HIS FOREHEAD WHICH HAS GOT A SCRATCH I PERCEIVE
HE BLEEDS SHIRLEY
DON'T HOLD ME
I MUST GO
NOT A STEP
HE IS HURT SHIRLEY
FIDDLESTICK
BUT I MUST GO TO HIM
I WISH TO GO SO MUCH
I CANNOT BEAR TO BE
RESTRAINED
WHAT FOR
TO SPEAK TO HIM TO ASK HOW HE IS AND WHAT I CAN DO FOR HIM
TO TEASE AND ANNOY HIM TO MAKE A SPECTACLE OF YOURSELF AND HIM BEFORE
THOSE SOLDIERS MR
MALONE YOUR UNCLE ET CETERA
WOULD HE LIKE IT
THINK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO REMEMBER IT A WEEK HENCE
AM I ALWAYS TO BE CURBED AND KEPT DOWN DEMANDED CAROLINE A LITTLE
PASSIONATELY
FOR HIS SAKE YES AND STILL MORE FOR YOUR OWN
I TELL YOU IF YOU
SHOWED YOURSELF NOW YOU WOULD REPENT IT AN HOUR HENCE AND SO WOULD
ROBERT
YOU THINK HE WOULD NOT LIKE IT SHIRLEY
FAR LESS THAN HE WOULD LIKE OUR STOPPING HIM TO SAY GOOD NIGHT WHICH
YOU WERE SO SORE ABOUT
BUT THAT WAS ALL PLAY THERE WAS NO DANGER
AND THIS IS SERIOUS WORK HE MUST BE UNMOLESTED
I ONLY WISH TO GO TO HIM BECAUSE HE IS MY COUSIN YOU UNDERSTAND
I QUITE UNDERSTAND
BUT NOW WATCH HIM
HE HAS BATHED HIS FOREHEAD AND
THE BLOOD HAS CEASED TRICKLING
HIS HURT IS REALLY A MERE GRAZE I CAN
SEE IT FROM HENCE
HE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER THE WOUNDED MEN
ACCORDINGLY MR
MOORE AND MR
HELSTONE WENT ROUND THE YARD EXAMINING
EACH PROSTRATE FORM
THEY THEN GAVE DIRECTIONS TO HAVE THE WOUNDED TAKEN
UP AND CARRIED INTO THE MILL
THIS DUTY BEING PERFORMED JOE SCOTT WAS
ORDERED TO SADDLE HIS MASTER'S HORSE AND MR
HELSTONE'S PONY AND THE
TWO GENTLEMEN RODE AWAY FULL GALLOP TO SEEK SURGICAL AID IN DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS
CAROLINE WAS NOT YET PACIFIED
SHIRLEY SHIRLEY I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO SPEAK ONE WORD TO HIM BEFORE
HE WENT SHE MURMURED WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED GLITTERING IN HER EYES
WHY DO YOU CRY LINA ASKED MISS KEELDAR A LITTLE STERNLY
YOU OUGHT
TO BE GLAD INSTEAD OF SORRY
ROBERT HAS ESCAPED ANY SERIOUS HARM HE IS
VICTORIOUS HE HAS BEEN COOL AND BRAVE IN COMBAT HE IS NOW CONSIDERATE
IN TRIUMPH
IS THIS A TIME ARE THESE CAUSES FOR WEEPING
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT I HAVE IN MY HEART PLEADED THE OTHER WHAT
PAIN WHAT DISTRACTION NOR WHENCE IT ARISES
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
SHOULD EXULT IN ROBERT'S GREATNESS AND GOODNESS SO DO I IN ONE SENSE
BUT IN ANOTHER I FEEL SO MISERABLE
I AM TOO FAR REMOVED FROM HIM
I
USED TO BE NEARER
LET ME ALONE SHIRLEY
DO LET ME CRY A FEW MINUTES
IT RELIEVES ME
MISS KEELDAR FEELING HER TREMBLE IN EVERY LIMB CEASED TO EXPOSTULATE
WITH HER
SHE WENT OUT OF THE SHED AND LEFT HER TO WEEP IN PEACE
IT
WAS THE BEST PLAN
IN A FEW MINUTES CAROLINE REJOINED HER MUCH CALMER
SHE SAID WITH HER NATURAL DOCILE GENTLE MANNER COME SHIRLEY WE
WILL GO HOME NOW
I PROMISE NOT TO TRY TO SEE ROBERT AGAIN TILL HE ASKS
FOR ME
I NEVER WILL TRY TO PUSH MYSELF ON HIM
I THANK YOU FOR
RESTRAINING ME JUST NOW
I DID IT WITH A GOOD INTENTION RETURNED MISS KEELDAR
NOW DEAR LINA SHE CONTINUED LET US TURN OUR FACES TO THE COOL
MORNING BREEZE AND WALK VERY QUIETLY BACK TO THE RECTORY
WE WILL STEAL
IN AS WE STOLE OUT
NONE SHALL KNOW WHERE WE HAVE BEEN OR WHAT WE HAVE
SEEN TO NIGHT NEITHER TAUNT NOR MISCONSTRUCTION CAN CONSEQUENTLY MOLEST
US
TO MORROW WE WILL SEE ROBERT AND BE OF GOOD CHEER BUT I WILL SAY
NO MORE LEST I SHOULD BEGIN TO CRY TOO
I SEEM HARD TOWARDS YOU BUT I
AM NOT SO
CHAPTER XX
TO MORROW
THE TWO GIRLS MET NO LIVING SOUL ON THEIR WAY BACK TO THE RECTORY
THEY
LET THEMSELVES IN NOISELESSLY THEY STOLE UPSTAIRS UNHEARD THE BREAKING
MORNING GAVE THEM WHAT LIGHT THEY NEEDED
SHIRLEY SOUGHT HER COUCH
IMMEDIATELY AND THOUGH THE ROOM WAS STRANGE FOR SHE HAD NEVER SLEPT AT
THE RECTORY BEFORE AND THOUGH THE RECENT SCENE WAS ONE UNPARALLELED FOR
EXCITEMENT AND TERROR BY ANY IT HAD HITHERTO BEEN HER LOT TO WITNESS
YET SCARCE WAS HER HEAD LAID ON THE PILLOW ERE A DEEP REFRESHING SLEEP
CLOSED HER EYES AND CALMED HER SENSES
PERFECT HEALTH WAS SHIRLEY'S ENVIABLE PORTION
THOUGH WARM HEARTED AND
SYMPATHETIC SHE WAS NOT NERVOUS POWERFUL EMOTIONS COULD ROUSE AND SWAY
WITHOUT EXHAUSTING HER SPIRIT
THE TEMPEST TROUBLED AND SHOOK HER WHILE
IT LASTED BUT IT LEFT HER ELASTICITY UNBENT AND HER FRESHNESS QUITE
UNBLIGHTED
AS EVERY DAY BROUGHT HER STIMULATING EMOTION SO EVERY NIGHT
YIELDED HER RECREATING REST
CAROLINE NOW WATCHED HER SLEEPING AND READ
THE SERENITY OF HER MIND IN THE BEAUTY OF HER HAPPY COUNTENANCE
FOR HERSELF BEING OF A DIFFERENT TEMPERAMENT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP
THE
COMMONPLACE EXCITEMENT OF THE TEA DRINKING AND SCHOOL GATHERING WOULD
ALONE HAVE SUFFICED TO MAKE HER RESTLESS ALL NIGHT THE EFFECT OF THE
TERRIBLE DRAMA WHICH HAD JUST BEEN ENACTED BEFORE HER EYES WAS NOT
LIKELY TO QUIT HER FOR DAYS
IT WAS VAIN EVEN TO TRY TO RETAIN A
RECUMBENT POSTURE SHE SAT UP BY SHIRLEY'S SIDE COUNTING THE SLOW
MINUTES AND WATCHING THE JUNE SUN MOUNT THE HEAVENS
LIFE WASTES FAST IN SUCH VIGILS AS CAROLINE HAD OF LATE BUT TOO OFTEN
KEPT VIGILS DURING WHICH THE MIND HAVING NO PLEASANT FOOD TO NOURISH
IT NO MANNA OF HOPE NO HIVED HONEY OF JOYOUS MEMORIES TRIES TO LIVE
ON THE MEAGRE DIET OF WISHES AND FAILING TO DERIVE THENCE EITHER
DELIGHT OR SUPPORT AND FEELING ITSELF READY TO PERISH WITH CRAVING
WANT TURNS TO PHILOSOPHY TO RESOLUTION TO RESIGNATION CALLS ON ALL
THESE GODS FOR AID CALLS VAINLY IS UNHEARD UNHELPED AND LANGUISHES
CAROLINE WAS A CHRISTIAN THEREFORE IN TROUBLE SHE FRAMED MANY A PRAYER
AFTER THE CHRISTIAN CREED PREFERRED IT WITH DEEP EARNESTNESS BEGGED
FOR PATIENCE STRENGTH RELIEF
THIS WORLD HOWEVER WE ALL KNOW IS THE
SCENE OF TRIAL AND PROBATION AND FOR ANY FAVOURABLE RESULT HER
PETITIONS HAD YET WROUGHT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THEY WERE UNHEARD AND
UNACCEPTED
SHE BELIEVED SOMETIMES THAT GOD HAD TURNED HIS FACE FROM
HER
AT MOMENTS SHE WAS A CALVINIST AND SINKING INTO THE GULF OF
RELIGIOUS DESPAIR SHE SAW DARKENING OVER HER THE DOOM OF REPROBATION
MOST PEOPLE HAVE HAD A PERIOD OR PERIODS IN THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY HAVE
FELT THUS FORSAKEN WHEN HAVING LONG HOPED AGAINST HOPE AND STILL SEEN
THE DAY OF FRUITION DEFERRED THEIR HEARTS HAVE TRULY SICKENED WITHIN
THEM
THIS IS A TERRIBLE HOUR BUT IT IS OFTEN THAT DARKEST POINT WHICH
PRECEDES THE RISE OF DAY THAT TURN OF THE YEAR WHEN THE ICY JANUARY
WIND CARRIES OVER THE WASTE AT ONCE THE DIRGE OF DEPARTING WINTER AND
THE PROPHECY OF COMING SPRING
THE PERISHING BIRDS HOWEVER CANNOT THUS
UNDERSTAND THE BLAST BEFORE WHICH THEY SHIVER AND AS LITTLE CAN THE
SUFFERING SOUL RECOGNIZE IN THE CLIMAX OF ITS AFFLICTION THE DAWN OF
ITS DELIVERANCE
YET LET WHOEVER GRIEVES STILL CLING FAST TO LOVE AND
FAITH IN GOD
GOD WILL NEVER DECEIVE NEVER FINALLY DESERT HIM
WHOM HE
LOVETH HE CHASTENETH THESE WORDS ARE TRUE AND SHOULD NOT BE
FORGOTTEN
THE HOUSEHOLD WAS ASTIR AT LAST THE SERVANTS WERE UP THE SHUTTERS WERE
OPENED BELOW
CAROLINE AS SHE QUITTED THE COUCH WHICH HAD BEEN BUT A
THORNY ONE TO HER FELT THAT REVIVAL OF SPIRITS WHICH THE RETURN OF DAY
OF ACTION GIVES TO ALL BUT THE WHOLLY DESPAIRING OR ACTUALLY DYING
SHE
DRESSED HERSELF AS USUAL CAREFULLY TRYING SO TO ARRANGE HER HAIR AND
ATTIRE THAT NOTHING OF THE FORLORNNESS SHE FELT AT HEART SHOULD BE
VISIBLE EXTERNALLY
SHE LOOKED AS FRESH AS SHIRLEY WHEN BOTH WERE
DRESSED ONLY THAT MISS KEELDAR'S EYES WERE LIVELY AND MISS HELSTONE'S
LANGUID
TO DAY I SHALL HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO MOORE WERE SHIRLEY'S FIRST WORDS
AND YOU COULD SEE IN HER FACE THAT LIFE WAS FULL OF INTEREST
EXPECTATION AND OCCUPATION FOR HER
HE WILL HAVE TO UNDERGO
CROSS EXAMINATION SHE ADDED
I DARE SAY HE THINKS HE HAS OUTWITTED ME
CLEVERLY
AND THIS IS THE WAY MEN DEAL WITH WOMEN STILL CONCEALING
DANGER FROM THEM THINKING I SUPPOSE TO SPARE THEM PAIN
THEY
IMAGINED WE LITTLE KNEW WHERE THEY WERE TO NIGHT
WE KNOW THEY LITTLE
CONJECTURED WHERE WE WERE
MEN I BELIEVE FANCY WOMEN'S MINDS SOMETHING
LIKE THOSE OF CHILDREN
NOW THAT IS A MISTAKE
THIS WAS SAID AS SHE STOOD AT THE GLASS TRAINING HER NATURALLY WAVED
HAIR INTO CURLS BY TWINING IT ROUND HER FINGERS
SHE TOOK UP THE THEME
AGAIN FIVE MINUTES AFTER AS CAROLINE FASTENED HER DRESS AND CLASPED HER
GIRDLE
IF MEN COULD SEE US AS WE REALLY ARE THEY WOULD BE A LITTLE AMAZED
BUT THE CLEVEREST THE ACUTEST MEN ARE OFTEN UNDER AN ILLUSION ABOUT
WOMEN
THEY DO NOT READ THEM IN A TRUE LIGHT THEY MISAPPREHEND THEM
BOTH FOR GOOD AND EVIL
THEIR GOOD WOMAN IS A QUEER THING HALF DOLL
HALF ANGEL THEIR BAD WOMAN ALMOST ALWAYS A FIEND
THEN TO HEAR THEM
FALL INTO ECSTASIES WITH EACH OTHER'S CREATIONS WORSHIPPING THE HEROINE
OF SUCH A POEM NOVEL DRAMA THINKING IT FINE DIVINE FINE AND DIVINE
IT MAY BE BUT OFTEN QUITE ARTIFICIAL FALSE AS THE ROSE IN MY BEST
BONNET THERE
IF I SPOKE ALL I THINK ON THIS POINT IF I GAVE MY REAL
OPINION OF SOME FIRST RATE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN FIRST RATE WORKS WHERE
SHOULD I BE DEAD UNDER A CAIRN OF AVENGING STONES IN HALF AN HOUR
SHIRLEY YOU CHATTER SO I CAN'T FASTEN YOU
BE STILL
AND AFTER ALL
AUTHORS' HEROINES ARE ALMOST AS GOOD AS AUTHORESSES' HEROES
NOT AT ALL
WOMEN READ MEN MORE TRULY THAN MEN READ WOMEN
I'LL PROVE
THAT IN A MAGAZINE PAPER SOME DAY WHEN I'VE TIME ONLY IT WILL NEVER BE
INSERTED
IT WILL BE 'DECLINED WITH THANKS AND LEFT FOR ME AT THE
PUBLISHER'S
TO BE SURE
YOU COULD NOT WRITE CLEVERLY ENOUGH
YOU DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
YOU ARE NOT LEARNED SHIRLEY
GOD KNOWS I CAN'T CONTRADICT YOU CARY I'M AS IGNORANT AS A STONE
THERE'S ONE COMFORT HOWEVER YOU ARE NOT MUCH BETTER
THEY DESCENDED TO BREAKFAST
I WONDER HOW MRS
PRYOR AND HORTENSE MOORE HAVE PASSED THE NIGHT SAID
CAROLINE AS SHE MADE THE COFFEE
SELFISH BEING THAT I AM I NEVER
THOUGHT OF EITHER OF THEM TILL JUST NOW
THEY WILL HAVE HEARD ALL THE
TUMULT FIELDHEAD AND THE COTTAGE ARE SO NEAR AND HORTENSE IS TIMID IN
SUCH MATTERS SO NO DOUBT IS MRS
PRYOR
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT LINA MOORE WILL HAVE CONTRIVED TO GET HIS SISTER
OUT OF THE WAY
SHE WENT HOME WITH MISS MANN
HE WILL HAVE QUARTERED
HER THERE FOR THE NIGHT
AS TO MRS
PRYOR I OWN I AM UNEASY ABOUT HER
BUT IN ANOTHER HALF HOUR WE WILL BE WITH HER
BY THIS TIME THE NEWS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE HOLLOW WAS SPREAD ALL
OVER THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
FANNY WHO HAD BEEN TO FIELDHEAD TO FETCH THE
MILK RETURNED IN PANTING HASTE WITH TIDINGS THAT THERE HAD BEEN A
BATTLE IN THE NIGHT AT MR
MOORE'S MILL AND THAT SOME SAID TWENTY MEN
WERE KILLED
ELIZA DURING FANNY'S ABSENCE HAD BEEN APPRISED BY THE
BUTCHER'S BOY THAT THE MILL WAS BURNT TO THE GROUND
BOTH WOMEN RUSHED
INTO THE PARLOUR TO ANNOUNCE THESE TERRIBLE FACTS TO THE LADIES
TERMINATING THEIR CLEAR AND ACCURATE NARRATIVE BY THE ASSERTION THAT
THEY WERE SURE MASTER MUST HAVE BEEN IN IT ALL
HE AND THOMAS THE
CLERK THEY WERE CONFIDENT MUST HAVE GONE LAST NIGHT TO JOIN MR
MOORE
AND THE SOLDIERS
MR
MALONE TOO HAD NOT BEEN HEARD OF AT HIS LODGINGS
SINCE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND JOE SCOTT'S WIFE AND FAMILY WERE IN THE
GREATEST DISTRESS WONDERING WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEIR HEAD
SCARCELY WAS THIS INFORMATION IMPARTED WHEN A KNOCK AT THE KITCHEN DOOR
ANNOUNCED THE FIELDHEAD ERRAND BOY ARRIVED IN HOT HASTE BEARING A
BILLET FROM MRS
PRYOR
IT WAS HURRIEDLY WRITTEN AND URGED MISS KEELDAR
TO RETURN DIRECTLY AS THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND THE HOUSE SEEMED LIKELY TO
BE ALL IN CONFUSION AND ORDERS WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN WHICH THE
MISTRESS OF THE HALL ALONE COULD REGULATE
IN A POSTSCRIPT IT WAS
ENTREATED THAT MISS HELSTONE MIGHT NOT BE LEFT ALONE AT THE RECTORY
SHE
HAD BETTER IT WAS SUGGESTED ACCOMPANY MISS KEELDAR
THERE ARE NOT TWO OPINIONS ON THAT HEAD SAID SHIRLEY AS SHE TIED ON
HER OWN BONNET AND THEN RAN TO FETCH CAROLINE'S
BUT WHAT WILL FANNY AND ELIZA DO AND IF MY UNCLE RETURNS
YOUR UNCLE WILL NOT RETURN YET HE HAS OTHER FISH TO FRY
HE WILL BE
GALLOPING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FROM BRIARFIELD TO STILBRO' ALL DAY
ROUSING THE MAGISTRATES IN THE COURT HOUSE AND THE OFFICERS AT THE
BARRACKS AND FANNY AND ELIZA CAN HAVE IN JOE SCOTT'S AND THE CLERK'S
WIVES TO BEAR THEM COMPANY
BESIDES OF COURSE THERE IS NO REAL DANGER
TO BE APPREHENDED NOW
WEEKS WILL ELAPSE BEFORE THE RIOTERS CAN AGAIN
RALLY OR PLAN ANY OTHER ATTEMPT AND I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF MOORE AND
MR
HELSTONE WILL NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LAST NIGHT'S OUTBREAK TO QUELL
THEM ALTOGETHER
THEY WILL FRIGHTEN THE AUTHORITIES OF STILBRO' INTO
ENERGETIC MEASURES
I ONLY HOPE THEY WILL NOT BE TOO SEVERE NOT PURSUE
THE DISCOMFITED TOO RELENTLESSLY
ROBERT WILL NOT BE CRUEL
WE SAW THAT LAST NIGHT SAID CAROLINE
BUT HE WILL BE HARD RETORTED SHIRLEY AND SO WILL YOUR UNCLE
AS THEY HURRIED ALONG THE MEADOW AND PLANTATION PATH TO FIELDHEAD THEY
SAW THE DISTANT HIGHWAY ALREADY ALIVE WITH AN UNWONTED FLOW OF
EQUESTRIANS AND PEDESTRIANS TENDING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE USUALLY
SOLITARY HOLLOW
ON REACHING THE HALL THEY FOUND THE BACKYARD GATES
OPEN AND THE COURT AND KITCHEN SEEMED CROWDED WITH EXCITED
MILK FETCHERS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHOM MRS
GILL THE
HOUSEKEEPER APPEARED VAINLY PERSUADING TO TAKE THEIR MILK CANS AND
DEPART
IT IS OR WAS BY THE BYE THE CUSTOM IN THE NORTH OF
ENGLAND FOR THE COTTAGERS ON A COUNTRY SQUIRE'S ESTATE TO RECEIVE THEIR
SUPPLIES OF MILK AND BUTTER FROM THE DAIRY OF THE MANOR HOUSE ON WHOSE
PASTURES A HERD OF MILCH KINE WAS USUALLY FED FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD
MISS KEELDAR OWNED SUCH A HERD ALL DEEP DEWLAPPED
CRAVEN COWS REARED ON THE SWEET HERBAGE AND CLEAR WATERS OF BONNY
AIREDALE AND VERY PROUD SHE WAS OF THEIR SLEEK ASPECT AND HIGH
CONDITION SEEING NOW THE STATE OF MATTERS AND THAT IT WAS DESIRABLE
TO EFFECT A CLEARANCE OF THE PREMISES SHIRLEY STEPPED IN AMONGST THE
GOSSIPING GROUPS
SHE BADE THEM GOOD MORNING WITH A CERTAIN FRANK
TRANQUIL EASE THE NATURAL CHARACTERISTIC OF HER MANNER WHEN SHE
ADDRESSED NUMBERS ESPECIALLY IF THOSE NUMBERS BELONGED TO THE
WORKING CLASS SHE WAS COOLER AMONGST HER EQUALS AND RATHER PROUD TO
THOSE ABOVE HER
SHE THEN ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD ALL GOT THEIR MILK
MEASURED OUT AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY HAD SHE FURTHER OBSERVED THAT
SHE WONDERED WHAT THEY WERE WAITING FOR THEN
WE'RE JUST TALKING A BIT OVER THIS BATTLE THERE HAS BEEN AT YOUR MILL
MISTRESS REPLIED A MAN
TALKING A BIT JUST LIKE YOU SAID SHIRLEY
IT IS A QUEER THING ALL
THE WORLD IS SO FOND OF TALKING OVER EVENTS
YOU TALK IF ANYBODY
DIES SUDDENLY YOU TALK IF A FIRE BREAKS OUT YOU TALK IF A
MILL OWNER FAILS YOU TALK IF HE'S MURDERED
WHAT GOOD DOES YOUR
TALKING DO
THERE IS NOTHING THE LOWER ORDERS LIKE BETTER THAN A LITTLE DOWNRIGHT
GOOD HUMOURED RATING
FLATTERY THEY SCORN VERY MUCH HONEST ABUSE THEY
ENJOY
THEY CALL IT SPEAKING PLAINLY AND TAKE A SINCERE DELIGHT IN
BEING THE OBJECTS THEREOF
THE HOMELY HARSHNESS OF MISS KEELDAR'S
SALUTATION WON HER THE EAR OF THE WHOLE THRONG IN A SECOND
WE'RE NO WAR NOR SOME 'AT IS ABOON US ARE WE ASKED A MAN SMILING
NOR A WHIT BETTER
YOU THAT SHOULD BE MODELS OF INDUSTRY ARE JUST AS
GOSSIP LOVING AS THE IDLE
FINE RICH PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO MAY
BE PARTLY EXCUSED FOR TRIFLING THEIR TIME AWAY YOU WHO HAVE TO EARN
YOUR BREAD WITH THE SWEAT OF YOUR BROW ARE QUITE INEXCUSABLE
THAT'S QUEER MISTRESS
SULD WE NEVER HAVE A HOLIDAY BECAUSE WE WORK
HARD
NEVER WAS THE PROMPT ANSWER UNLESS ADDED THE MISTRESS WITH A
SMILE THAT HALF BELIED THE SEVERITY OF HER SPEECH UNLESS YOU KNEW HOW
TO MAKE A BETTER USE OF IT THAN TO GET TOGETHER OVER RUM AND TEA IF YOU
ARE WOMEN OR OVER BEER AND PIPES IF YOU ARE MEN AND TALK SCANDAL AT
YOUR NEIGHBOURS' EXPENSE
COME FRIENDS SHE ADDED CHANGING AT ONCE
FROM BLUNTNESS TO COURTESY OBLIGE ME BY TAKING YOUR CANS AND GOING
HOME
I EXPECT SEVERAL PERSONS TO CALL TO DAY AND IT WILL BE
INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE AVENUES TO THE HOUSE CROWDED
YORKSHIRE PEOPLE ARE AS YIELDING TO PERSUASION AS THEY ARE STUBBORN
AGAINST COMPULSION
THE YARD WAS CLEAR IN FIVE MINUTES
THANK YOU AND GOOD BYE TO YOU FRIENDS SAID SHIRLEY AS SHE CLOSED
THE GATES ON A QUIET COURT
NOW LET ME HEAR THE MOST REFINED OF COCKNEYS PRESUME TO FIND FAULT WITH
YORKSHIRE MANNERS
TAKEN AS THEY OUGHT TO BE THE MAJORITY OF THE LADS
AND LASSES OF THE WEST RIDING ARE GENTLEMEN AND LADIES EVERY INCH OF
THEM
IT IS ONLY AGAINST THE WEAK AFFECTATION AND FUTILE POMPOSITY OF A
WOULD BE ARISTOCRAT THEY TURN MUTINOUS
ENTERING BY THE BACK WAY THE YOUNG LADIES PASSED THROUGH THE KITCHEN
OR HOUSE AS THE INNER KITCHEN IS CALLED TO THE HALL
MRS
PRYOR
CAME RUNNING DOWN THE OAK STAIRCASE TO MEET THEM
SHE WAS ALL UNNERVED
HER NATURALLY SANGUINE COMPLEXION WAS PALE HER USUALLY PLACID THOUGH
TIMID BLUE EYE WAS WANDERING UNSETTLED ALARMED
SHE DID NOT HOWEVER
BREAK OUT INTO ANY EXCLAMATIONS OR HURRIED NARRATIVE OF WHAT HAD
HAPPENED
HER PREDOMINANT FEELING HAD BEEN IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT
AND WAS NOW THIS MORNING A SENSE OF DISSATISFACTION WITH HERSELF THAT
SHE COULD NOT FEEL FIRMER COOLER MORE EQUAL TO THE DEMANDS OF THE
OCCASION
YOU ARE AWARE SHE BEGAN WITH A TREMBLING VOICE AND YET THE MOST
CONSCIENTIOUS ANXIETY TO AVOID EXAGGERATION IN WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO
SAY THAT A BODY OF RIOTERS HAS ATTACKED MR
MOORE'S MILL TO NIGHT
WE
HEARD THE FIRING AND CONFUSION VERY PLAINLY HERE WE NONE OF US SLEPT
IT WAS A SAD NIGHT
THE HOUSE HAS BEEN IN GREAT BUSTLE ALL THE MORNING
WITH PEOPLE COMING AND GOING
THE SERVANTS HAVE APPLIED TO ME FOR ORDERS
AND DIRECTIONS WHICH I REALLY DID NOT FEEL WARRANTED IN GIVING
MR
MOORE HAS I BELIEVE SENT UP FOR REFRESHMENTS FOR THE SOLDIERS AND
OTHERS ENGAGED IN THE DEFENCE FOR SOME CONVENIENCES ALSO FOR THE
WOUNDED
I COULD NOT UNDERTAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GIVING ORDERS OR
TAKING MEASURES
I FEAR DELAY MAY HAVE BEEN INJURIOUS IN SOME INSTANCES
BUT THIS IS NOT MY HOUSE
YOU WERE ABSENT MY DEAR MISS KEELDAR
WHAT
COULD I DO
WERE NO REFRESHMENTS SENT ASKED SHIRLEY WHILE HER COUNTENANCE
HITHERTO SO CLEAR PROPITIOUS AND QUIET EVEN WHILE SHE WAS RATING THE
MILK FETCHERS SUDDENLY TURNED DARK AND WARM
I THINK NOT MY DEAR
AND NOTHING FOR THE WOUNDED NO LINEN NO WINE NO BEDDING
I THINK NOT
I CANNOT TELL WHAT MRS
GILL DID BUT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
TO ME AT THE MOMENT TO VENTURE TO DISPOSE OF YOUR PROPERTY BY SENDING
SUPPLIES TO SOLDIERS
PROVISIONS FOR A COMPANY OF SOLDIERS SOUNDS
FORMIDABLE
HOW MANY THERE ARE I DID NOT ASK BUT I COULD NOT THINK OF
ALLOWING THEM TO PILLAGE THE HOUSE AS IT WERE
I INTENDED TO DO WHAT
WAS RIGHT YET I DID NOT SEE THE CASE QUITE CLEARLY I OWN
IT LIES IN A NUTSHELL NOTWITHSTANDING
THESE SOLDIERS HAVE RISKED
THEIR LIVES IN DEFENCE OF MY PROPERTY I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO MY
GRATITUDE
THE WOUNDED ARE OUR FELLOW CREATURES I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD AID
THEM MRS
GILL
SHE TURNED AND CALLED IN A VOICE MORE CLEAR THAN SOFT
IT RANG THROUGH
THE THICK OAK OF THE HALL AND KITCHEN DOORS MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN A
BELL'S SUMMONS
MRS
GILL WHO WAS DEEP IN BREAD MAKING CAME WITH HANDS
AND APRON IN CULINARY CASE NOT HAVING DARED TO STOP TO RUB THE DOUGH
FROM THE ONE OR TO SHAKE THE FLOUR FROM THE OTHER
HER MISTRESS HAD
NEVER CALLED A SERVANT IN THAT VOICE SAVE ONCE BEFORE AND THAT WAS WHEN
SHE HAD SEEN FROM THE WINDOW TARTAR IN FULL TUG WITH TWO CARRIERS' DOGS
EACH OF THEM A MATCH FOR HIM IN SIZE IF NOT IN COURAGE AND THEIR
MASTERS STANDING BY ENCOURAGING THEIR ANIMALS WHILE HERS WAS
UNBEFRIENDED
THEN INDEED SHE HAD SUMMONED JOHN AS IF THE DAY OF
JUDGMENT WERE AT HAND
NOR HAD SHE WAITED FOR THE SAID JOHN'S COMING
BUT HAD WALKED OUT INTO THE LANE BONNETLESS AND AFTER INFORMING THE
CARRIERS THAT SHE HELD THEM FAR LESS OF MEN THAN THE THREE BRUTES
WHIRLING AND WORRYING IN THE DUST BEFORE THEM HAD PUT HER HANDS ROUND
THE THICK NECK OF THE LARGEST OF THE CURS AND GIVEN HER WHOLE STRENGTH
TO THE ESSAY OF CHOKING IT FROM TARTAR'S TORN AND BLEEDING EYE JUST
ABOVE AND BELOW WHICH ORGAN THE VENGEFUL FANGS WERE INSERTED
FIVE OR
SIX MEN WERE PRESENTLY ON THE SPOT TO HELP HER BUT SHE NEVER THANKED
ONE OF THEM
THEY MIGHT HAVE COME BEFORE IF THEIR WILL HAD BEEN GOOD
SHE SAID
SHE HAD NOT A WORD FOR ANYBODY DURING THE REST OF THE DAY BUT
SAT NEAR THE HALL FIRE TILL EVENING WATCHING AND TENDING TARTAR WHO LAY
ALL GORY STIFF AND SWELLED ON A MAT AT HER FEET
SHE WEPT FURTIVELY
OVER HIM SOMETIMES AND MURMURED THE SOFTEST WORDS OF PITY AND
ENDEARMENT IN TONES WHOSE MUSIC THE OLD SCARRED CANINE WARRIOR
ACKNOWLEDGED BY LICKING HER HAND OR HER SANDAL ALTERNATELY WITH HIS OWN
RED WOUNDS
AS TO JOHN HIS LADY TURNED A COLD SHOULDER ON HIM FOR A
WEEK AFTERWARDS
MRS
GILL REMEMBERING THIS LITTLE EPISODE CAME ALL OF A TREMBLE AS
SHE SAID HERSELF
IN A FIRM BRIEF VOICE MISS KEELDAR PROCEEDED TO PUT
QUESTIONS AND GIVE ORDERS
THAT AT SUCH A TIME FIELDHEAD SHOULD HAVE
EVINCED THE INHOSPITALITY OF A MISER'S HOVEL STUNG HER HAUGHTY SPIRIT TO
THE QUICK AND THE REVOLT OF ITS PRIDE WAS SEEN IN THE HEAVING OF HER
HEART STIRRED STORMILY UNDER THE LACE AND SILK WHICH VEILED IT
HOW LONG IS IT SINCE THAT MESSAGE CAME FROM THE MILL
NOT AN HOUR YET MA'AM ANSWERED THE HOUSEKEEPER SOOTHINGLY
NOT AN HOUR YOU MIGHT ALMOST AS WELL HAVE SAID NOT A DAY
THEY WILL
HAVE APPLIED ELSEWHERE BY THIS TIME
SEND A MAN INSTANTLY DOWN TO TELL
THEM THAT EVERYTHING THIS HOUSE CONTAINS IS AT MR
MOORE'S MR
HELSTONE'S AND THE SOLDIERS' SERVICE
DO THAT FIRST
WHILE THE ORDER WAS BEING EXECUTED SHIRLEY MOVED AWAY FROM HER FRIENDS
AND STOOD AT THE HALL WINDOW SILENT UNAPPROACHABLE
WHEN MRS
GILL
CAME BACK SHE TURNED
THE PURPLE FLUSH WHICH PAINFUL EXCITEMENT KINDLES
ON A PALE CHEEK GLOWED ON HERS THE SPARK WHICH DISPLEASURE LIGHTS IN A
DARK EYE FIRED HER GLANCE
LET THE CONTENTS OF THE LARDER AND THE WINE CELLAR BE BROUGHT UP PUT
INTO THE HAY CARTS AND DRIVEN DOWN TO THE HOLLOW
IF THERE DOES NOT
HAPPEN TO BE MUCH BREAD OR MUCH MEAT IN THE HOUSE GO TO THE BUTCHER AND
BAKER AND DESIRE THEM TO SEND WHAT THEY HAVE
BUT I WILL SEE FOR
MYSELF
SHE MOVED OFF
ALL WILL BE RIGHT SOON SHE WILL GET OVER IT IN AN HOUR WHISPERED
CAROLINE TO MRS
PRYOR
GO UPSTAIRS DEAR MADAM SHE ADDED
AFFECTIONATELY AND TRY TO BE AS CALM AND EASY AS YOU CAN
THE TRUTH
IS SHIRLEY WILL BLAME HERSELF MORE THAN YOU BEFORE THE DAY IS OVER
BY DINT OF A FEW MORE GENTLE ASSURANCES AND PERSUASIONS MISS HELSTONE
CONTRIVED TO SOOTHE THE AGITATED LADY
HAVING ACCOMPANIED HER TO HER
APARTMENT AND PROMISED TO REJOIN HER THERE WHEN THINGS WERE SETTLED
CAROLINE LEFT HER TO SEE AS SHE SAID IF SHE COULD BE USEFUL SHE
PRESENTLY FOUND THAT SHE COULD BE VERY USEFUL FOR THE RETINUE OF
SERVANTS AT FIELDHEAD WAS BY NO MEANS NUMEROUS AND JUST NOW THEIR
MISTRESS FOUND PLENTY OF OCCUPATION FOR ALL THE HANDS AT HER COMMAND
AND FOR HER OWN ALSO
THE DELICATE GOOD NATURE AND DEXTEROUS ACTIVITY
WHICH CAROLINE BROUGHT TO THE AID OF THE HOUSEKEEPER AND MAIDS ALL
SOMEWHAT SCARED BY THEIR LADY'S UNWONTED MOOD DID A WORLD OF GOOD AT
ONCE IT HELPED THE ASSISTANTS AND APPEASED THE DIRECTRESS
A CHANCE
GLANCE AND SMILE FROM CAROLINE MOVED SHIRLEY TO AN ANSWERING SMILE
DIRECTLY
THE FORMER WAS CARRYING A HEAVY BASKET UP THE CELLAR STAIRS
THIS IS A SHAME CRIED SHIRLEY RUNNING TO HER
IT WILL STRAIN YOUR
ARM
SHE TOOK IT FROM HER AND HERSELF BORE IT OUT INTO THE YARD
THE CLOUD
OF TEMPER WAS DISPELLED WHEN SHE CAME BACK THE FLASH IN HER EYE WAS
MELTED THE SHADE ON HER FOREHEAD VANISHED
SHE RESUMED HER USUAL
CHEERFUL AND CORDIAL MANNER TO THOSE ABOUT HER TEMPERING HER REVIVED
SPIRITS WITH A LITTLE OF THE SOFTNESS OF SHAME AT HER PREVIOUS UNJUST
ANGER
SHE WAS STILL SUPERINTENDING THE LADING OF THE CART WHEN A GENTLEMAN
ENTERED THE YARD AND APPROACHED HER ERE SHE WAS AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE
I HOPE I SEE MISS KEELDAR WELL THIS MORNING HE SAID EXAMINING WITH
RATHER SIGNIFICANT SCRUTINY HER STILL FLUSHED FACE
SHE GAVE HIM A LOOK AND THEN AGAIN BENT TO HER EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT
REPLY
A PLEASANT ENOUGH SMILE PLAYED ON HER LIPS BUT SHE HID IT
THE
GENTLEMAN REPEATED HIS SALUTATION STOOPING THAT IT MIGHT REACH HER EAR
WITH MORE FACILITY
WELL ENOUGH IF SHE BE GOOD ENOUGH WAS THE ANSWER AND SO IS MR
MOORE TOO I DARE SAY
TO SPEAK TRUTH I AM NOT ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM SOME
SLIGHT MISCHANCE WOULD BE ONLY HIS JUST DUE
HIS CONDUCT HAS BEEN WE
WILL SAY STRANGE JUST NOW TILL WE HAVE TIME TO CHARACTERIZE IT BY A
MORE EXACT EPITHET
MEANTIME MAY I ASK WHAT BRINGS HIM HERE
MR
HELSTONE AND I HAVE JUST RECEIVED YOUR MESSAGE THAT EVERYTHING AT
FIELDHEAD WAS AT OUR SERVICE
WE JUDGED BY THE UNLIMITED WORDING OF THE
GRACIOUS INTIMATION THAT YOU WOULD BE GIVING YOURSELF TOO MUCH TROUBLE
I PERCEIVE OUR CONJECTURE WAS CORRECT
WE ARE NOT A REGIMENT
REMEMBER ONLY ABOUT HALF A DOZEN SOLDIERS AND AS MANY CIVILIANS
ALLOW
ME TO RETRENCH SOMETHING FROM THESE TOO ABUNDANT SUPPLIES
MISS KEELDAR BLUSHED WHILE SHE LAUGHED AT HER OWN OVER EAGER GENEROSITY
AND MOST DISPROPORTIONATE CALCULATIONS
MOORE LAUGHED TOO VERY QUIETLY
THOUGH AND AS QUIETLY HE ORDERED BASKET AFTER BASKET TO BE TAKEN FROM
THE CART AND REMANDED VESSEL AFTER VESSEL TO THE CELLAR
THE RECTOR MUST HEAR OF THIS HE SAID HE WILL MAKE A GOOD STORY OF
IT
WHAT AN EXCELLENT ARMY CONTRACTOR MISS KEELDAR WOULD HAVE BEEN
AGAIN HE LAUGHED ADDING IT IS PRECISELY AS I CONJECTURED
YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL SAID SHIRLEY AND NOT MOCK ME
WHAT COULD I
DO HOW COULD I GAUGE YOUR APPETITES OR NUMBER YOUR BAND FOR AUGHT I
KNEW THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIFTY OF YOU AT LEAST TO VICTUAL
YOU TOLD
ME NOTHING AND THEN AN APPLICATION TO PROVISION SOLDIERS NATURALLY
SUGGESTS LARGE IDEAS
IT APPEARS SO REMARKED MOORE LEVELLING ANOTHER OF HIS KEEN QUIET
GLANCES AT THE DISCOMFITED SHIRLEY NOW HE CONTINUED ADDRESSING THE
CARTER I THINK YOU MAY TAKE WHAT REMAINS TO THE HOLLOW
YOUR LOAD WILL
BE SOMEWHAT LIGHTER THAN THE ONE MISS KEELDAR DESTINED YOU TO CARRY
AS THE VEHICLE RUMBLED OUT OF THE YARD SHIRLEY RALLYING HER SPIRITS
DEMANDED WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE WOUNDED
THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE MAN HURT ON OUR SIDE WAS THE ANSWER
YOU WERE HURT YOURSELF ON THE TEMPLES INTERPOSED A QUICK LOW
VOICE THAT OF CAROLINE WHO HAVING WITHDRAWN WITHIN THE SHADE OF THE
DOOR AND BEHIND THE LARGE PERSON OF MRS
GILL HAD TILL NOW ESCAPED
MOORE'S NOTICE
WHEN SHE SPOKE HIS EYE SEARCHED THE OBSCURITY OF HER
RETREAT
ARE YOU MUCH HURT SHE INQUIRED
AS YOU MIGHT SCRATCH YOUR FINGER WITH A NEEDLE IN SEWING
LIFT YOUR HAIR AND LET US SEE
HE TOOK HIS HAT OFF AND DID AS HE WAS BID DISCLOSING ONLY A NARROW
SLIP OF COURT PLASTER
CAROLINE INDICATED BY A SLIGHT MOVEMENT OF THE
HEAD THAT SHE WAS SATISFIED AND DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE CLEAR OBSCURE
OF THE INTERIOR
HOW DID SHE KNOW I WAS HURT ASKED MOORE
BY RUMOUR NO DOUBT
BUT IT IS TOO GOOD IN HER TO TROUBLE HERSELF ABOUT
YOU
FOR MY PART IT WAS OF YOUR VICTIMS I WAS THINKING WHEN I INQUIRED
AFTER THE WOUNDED
WHAT DAMAGE HAVE YOUR OPPONENTS SUSTAINED
ONE OF THE RIOTERS OR VICTIMS AS YOU CALL THEM WAS KILLED AND SIX
WERE HURT
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THEM
WHAT YOU WILL PERFECTLY APPROVE
MEDICAL AID WAS PROCURED IMMEDIATELY
AND AS SOON AS WE CAN GET A COUPLE OF COVERED WAGONS AND SOME CLEAN
STRAW THEY WILL BE REMOVED TO STILBRO'
STRAW YOU MUST HAVE BEDS AND BEDDING
I WILL SEND MY WAGON DIRECTLY
PROPERLY FURNISHED AND MR
YORKE I AM SURE WILL SEND HIS
YOU GUESS CORRECTLY HE HAS VOLUNTEERED ALREADY
AND MRS
YORKE WHO
LIKE YOU SEEMS DISPOSED TO REGARD THE RIOTERS AS MARTYRS AND ME AND
ESPECIALLY MR
HELSTONE AS MURDERERS IS AT THIS MOMENT I BELIEVE
MOST ASSIDUOUSLY ENGAGED IN FITTING IT UP WITH FEATHER BEDS PILLOWS
BOLSTERS BLANKETS ETC
THE VICTIMS LACK NO ATTENTIONS I PROMISE
YOU
MR
HALL YOUR FAVOURITE PARSON HAS BEEN WITH THEM EVER SINCE SIX
O'CLOCK EXHORTING THEM PRAYING WITH THEM AND EVEN WAITING ON THEM
LIKE ANY NURSE AND CAROLINE'S GOOD FRIEND MISS AINLEY THAT VERY
PLAIN OLD MAID SENT IN A STOCK OF LINT AND LINEN SOMETHING IN THE
PROPORTION OF ANOTHER LADY'S ALLOWANCE OF BEEF AND WINE
THAT WILL DO
WHERE IS YOUR SISTER
WELL CARED FOR
I HAD HER SECURELY DOMICILED WITH MISS MANN
THIS VERY
MORNING THE TWO SET OUT FOR WORMWOOD WELLS A NOTED WATERING PLACE
AND WILL STAY THERE SOME WEEKS
SO MR
HELSTONE DOMICILED ME AT THE RECTORY MIGHTY CLEVER YOU
GENTLEMEN THINK YOU ARE I MAKE YOU HEARTILY WELCOME TO THE IDEA AND
HOPE ITS SAVOUR AS YOU CHEW THE CUD OF REFLECTION UPON IT GIVES YOU
PLEASURE
ACUTE AND ASTUTE WHY ARE YOU NOT ALSO OMNISCIENT HOW IS IT
THAT EVENTS TRANSPIRE UNDER YOUR VERY NOSES OF WHICH YOU HAVE NO
SUSPICION IT SHOULD BE SO OTHERWISE THE EXQUISITE GRATIFICATION OF
OUTMANOEUVRING YOU WOULD BE UNKNOWN
AH FRIEND YOU MAY SEARCH MY
COUNTENANCE BUT YOU CANNOT READ IT
MOORE INDEED LOOKED AS IF HE COULD NOT
YOU THINK ME A DANGEROUS SPECIMEN OF MY SEX
DON'T YOU NOW
A PECULIAR ONE AT LEAST
BUT CAROLINE IS SHE PECULIAR
IN HER WAY YES
HER WAY WHAT IS HER WAY
YOU KNOW HER AS WELL AS I DO
AND KNOWING HER I ASSERT THAT SHE IS NEITHER ECCENTRIC NOR DIFFICULT
OF CONTROL
IS SHE
THAT DEPENDS
HOWEVER THERE IS NOTHING MASCULINE ABOUT HER
WHY LAY SUCH EMPHASIS ON HER DO YOU CONSIDER HER A CONTRAST IN THAT
RESPECT TO YOURSELF
YOU DO NO DOUBT BUT THAT DOES NOT SIGNIFY
CAROLINE IS NEITHER
MASCULINE NOR OF WHAT THEY CALL THE SPIRITED ORDER OF WOMEN
I HAVE SEEN HER FLASH OUT
SO HAVE I BUT NOT WITH MANLY FIRE
IT WAS A SHORT VIVID TREMBLING
GLOW THAT SHOT UP SHONE VANISHED
AND LEFT HER SCARED AT HER OWN DARING
YOU DESCRIBE OTHERS BESIDES
CAROLINE
THE POINT I WISH TO ESTABLISH IS THAT MISS HELSTONE THOUGH GENTLE
TRACTABLE AND CANDID ENOUGH IS STILL PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF DEFYING EVEN
MR
MOORE'S PENETRATION
WHAT HAVE YOU AND SHE BEEN DOING ASKED MOORE SUDDENLY
HAVE YOU HAD ANY BREAKFAST
WHAT IS YOUR MUTUAL MYSTERY
IF YOU ARE HUNGRY MRS
GILL WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT HERE
STEP
INTO THE OAK PARLOUR AND RING THE BELL
YOU WILL BE SERVED AS IF AT AN
INN OR IF YOU LIKE BETTER GO BACK TO THE HOLLOW
THE ALTERNATIVE IS NOT OPEN TO ME I MUST GO BACK
GOOD MORNING
THE
FIRST LEISURE I HAVE I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN
CHAPTER XXI
MRS
PRYOR
WHILE SHIRLEY WAS TALKING WITH MOORE CAROLINE REJOINED MRS
PRYOR
UPSTAIRS
SHE FOUND THAT LADY DEEPLY DEPRESSED
SHE WOULD NOT SAY THAT
MISS KEELDAR'S HASTINESS HAD HURT HER FEELINGS BUT IT WAS EVIDENT AN
INWARD WOUND GALLED HER
TO ANY BUT A CONGENIAL NATURE SHE WOULD HAVE
SEEMED INSENSIBLE TO THE QUIET TENDER ATTENTIONS BY WHICH MISS HELSTONE
SOUGHT TO IMPART SOLACE BUT CAROLINE KNEW THAT UNMOVED OR SLIGHTLY
MOVED AS SHE LOOKED SHE FELT VALUED AND WAS HEALED BY THEM
I AM DEFICIENT IN SELF CONFIDENCE AND DECISION SHE SAID AT LAST
I
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN DEFICIENT IN THOSE QUALITIES
YET I THINK MISS KEELDAR
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN MY CHARACTER WELL ENOUGH BY THIS TIME TO BE AWARE THAT
I ALWAYS FEEL AN EVEN PAINFUL SOLICITUDE TO DO RIGHT TO ACT FOR THE
BEST
THE UNUSUAL NATURE OF THE DEMAND ON MY JUDGMENT PUZZLED ME
ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE ALARMS OF THE NIGHT
I COULD NOT VENTURE TO ACT
PROMPTLY FOR ANOTHER BUT I TRUST NO SERIOUS HARM WILL RESULT FROM MY
LAPSE OF FIRMNESS
A GENTLE KNOCK WAS HERE HEARD AT THE DOOR
IT WAS HALF OPENED
CAROLINE COME HERE SAID A LOW VOICE
MISS HELSTONE WENT OUT
THERE STOOD SHIRLEY IN THE GALLERY LOOKING
CONTRITE ASHAMED SORRY AS ANY REPENTANT CHILD
HOW IS MRS
PRYOR SHE ASKED
RATHER OUT OF SPIRITS SAID CAROLINE
I HAVE BEHAVED VERY SHAMEFULLY VERY UNGENEROUSLY VERY UNGRATEFULLY TO
HER SAID SHIRLEY
HOW INSOLENT IN ME TO TURN ON HER THUS FOR WHAT
AFTER ALL WAS NO FAULT ONLY AN EXCESS OF CONSCIENTIOUSNESS ON HER
PART
BUT I REGRET MY ERROR MOST SINCERELY
TELL HER SO AND ASK IF SHE
WILL FORGIVE ME
CAROLINE DISCHARGED THE ERRAND WITH HEARTFELT PLEASURE
MRS
PRYOR ROSE
CAME TO THE DOOR
SHE DID NOT LIKE SCENES SHE DREADED THEM AS ALL
TIMID PEOPLE DO
SHE SAID FALTERINGLY COME IN MY DEAR
SHIRLEY DID COME IN WITH SOME IMPETUOSITY
SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HER
GOVERNESS AND WHILE SHE KISSED HER HEARTILY SHE SAID YOU KNOW YOU
MUST FORGIVE ME MRS
PRYOR
I COULD NOT GET ON AT ALL IF THERE WAS A
MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN YOU AND ME
I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE WAS THE REPLY
WE WILL PASS IT OVER NOW
IF YOU PLEASE
THE FINAL RESULT OF THE INCIDENT IS THAT IT PROVES MORE
PLAINLY THAN EVER HOW UNEQUAL I AM TO CERTAIN CRISES
AND THAT WAS THE PAINFUL FEELING WHICH WOULD REMAIN ON MRS
PRYOR'S
MIND
NO EFFORT OF SHIRLEY'S OR CAROLINE'S COULD EFFACE IT THENCE
SHE
COULD FORGIVE HER OFFENDING PUPIL NOT HER INNOCENT SELF
MISS KEELDAR DOOMED TO BE IN CONSTANT REQUEST DURING THE MORNING WAS
PRESENTLY SUMMONED DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN
THE RECTOR CALLED FIRST
A LIVELY
WELCOME AND LIVELIER REPRIMAND WERE AT HIS SERVICE
HE EXPECTED BOTH
AND BEING IN HIGH SPIRITS TOOK THEM IN EQUALLY GOOD PART
IN THE COURSE OF HIS BRIEF VISIT HE QUITE FORGOT TO ASK AFTER HIS NIECE
THE RIOT THE RIOTERS THE MILL THE MAGISTRATES THE HEIRESS ABSORBED
ALL HIS THOUGHTS TO THE EXCLUSION OF FAMILY TIES
HE ALLUDED TO THE PART
HIMSELF AND CURATE HAD TAKEN IN THE DEFENCE OF THE HOLLOW
THE VIALS OF PHARISAICAL WRATH WILL BE EMPTIED ON OUR HEADS FOR OUR
SHARE IN THIS BUSINESS HE SAID BUT I DEFY EVERY CALUMNIATOR
I WAS
THERE ONLY TO SUPPORT THE LAW TO PLAY MY PART AS A MAN AND A BRITON
WHICH CHARACTERS I DEEM QUITE COMPATIBLE WITH THOSE OF THE PRIEST AND
LEVITE IN THEIR HIGHEST SENSE
YOUR TENANT MOORE HE WENT ON HAS WON
MY APPROBATION
A COOLER COMMANDER I WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE NOR A MORE
DETERMINED
BESIDES THE MAN HAS SHOWN SOUND JUDGMENT AND GOOD
SENSE FIRST IN BEING THOROUGHLY PREPARED FOR THE EVENT WHICH HAS TAKEN
PLACE AND SUBSEQUENTLY WHEN HIS WELL CONCERTED PLANS HAD SECURED HIM
SUCCESS IN KNOWING HOW TO USE WITHOUT ABUSING HIS VICTORY
SOME OF THE
MAGISTRATES ARE NOW WELL FRIGHTENED AND LIKE ALL COWARDS SHOW A
TENDENCY TO BE CRUEL
MOORE RESTRAINS THEM WITH ADMIRABLE PRUDENCE
HE
HAS HITHERTO BEEN VERY UNPOPULAR IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BUT MARK MY
WORDS THE TIDE OF OPINION WILL NOW TAKE A TURN IN HIS FAVOUR
PEOPLE
WILL FIND OUT THAT THEY HAVE NOT APPRECIATED HIM AND WILL HASTEN TO
REMEDY THEIR ERROR AND HE WHEN HE PERCEIVES THE PUBLIC DISPOSED TO
ACKNOWLEDGE HIS MERITS WILL SHOW A MORE GRACIOUS MIEN THAN THAT WITH
WHICH HE HAS HITHERTO FAVOURED US
MR
HELSTONE WAS ABOUT TO ADD TO THIS SPEECH SOME HALF JESTING
HALF SERIOUS WARNINGS TO MISS KEELDAR ON THE SUBJECT OF HER RUMOURED
PARTIALITY FOR HER TALENTED TENANT WHEN A RING AT THE DOOR ANNOUNCING
ANOTHER CALLER CHECKED HIS RAILLERY AND AS THAT OTHER CALLER APPEARED
IN THE FORM OF A WHITE HAIRED ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WITH A RATHER TRUCULENT
COUNTENANCE AND DISDAINFUL EYE IN SHORT OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND THE
RECTOR'S OLD ENEMY MR
YORKE THE PRIEST AND LEVITE SEIZED HIS HAT AND
WITH THE BRIEFEST OF ADIEUS TO MISS KEELDAR AND THE STERNEST OF NODS TO
HER GUEST TOOK AN ABRUPT LEAVE
MR
YORKE WAS IN NO MILD MOOD AND IN NO MEASURED TERMS DID HE EXPRESS
HIS OPINION ON THE TRANSACTION OF THE NIGHT
MOORE THE MAGISTRATES THE
SOLDIERS THE MOB LEADERS EACH AND ALL CAME IN FOR A SHARE OF HIS
INVECTIVES BUT HE RESERVED HIS STRONGEST EPITHETS AND REAL RACY
YORKSHIRE DORIC ADJECTIVES THEY WERE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FIGHTING
PARSONS THE SANGUINARY DEMONIAC RECTOR AND CURATE
ACCORDING TO HIM
THE CUP OF ECCLESIASTICAL GUILT WAS NOW FULL INDEED
THE CHURCH HE SAID WAS IN A BONNY PICKLE NOW
IT WAS TIME IT CAME
DOWN WHEN PARSONS TOOK TO SWAGGERING AMANG SOLDIERS BLAZING AWAY WI'
BULLET AND GUNPOWDER TAKING THE LIVES OF FAR HONESTER MEN THAN
THEMSELVES
WHAT WOULD MOORE HAVE DONE IF NOBODY HAD HELPED HIM ASKED SHIRLEY
DRUNK AS HE'D BREWED EATEN AS HE'D BAKED
WHICH MEANS YOU WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM BY HIMSELF TO FACE THAT MOB
GOOD
HE HAS PLENTY OF COURAGE BUT THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF GALLANTRY THAT EVER
GARRISONED ONE HUMAN BREAST COULD SCARCE AVAIL AGAINST TWO HUNDRED
HE HAD THE SOLDIERS THOSE POOR SLAVES WHO HIRE OUT THEIR OWN BLOOD AND
SPILL OTHER FOLK'S FOR MONEY
YOU ABUSE SOLDIERS ALMOST AS MUCH AS YOU ABUSE CLERGYMEN
ALL WHO WEAR
RED COATS ARE NATIONAL REFUSE IN YOUR EYES AND ALL WHO WEAR BLACK ARE
NATIONAL SWINDLERS
MR
MOORE ACCORDING TO YOU DID WRONG TO GET
MILITARY AID AND HE DID STILL WORSE TO ACCEPT OF ANY OTHER AID
YOUR
WAY OF TALKING AMOUNTS TO THIS HE SHOULD HAVE ABANDONED HIS MILL AND
HIS LIFE TO THE RAGE OF A SET OF MISGUIDED MADMEN AND MR
HELSTONE AND
EVERY OTHER GENTLEMAN IN THE PARISH SHOULD HAVE LOOKED ON AND SEEN THE
BUILDING RAZED AND ITS OWNER SLAUGHTERED AND NEVER STIRRED A FINGER TO
SAVE EITHER
IF MOORE HAD BEHAVED TO HIS MEN FROM THE BEGINNING AS A MASTER OUGHT TO
BEHAVE THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE ENTERTAINED THEIR PRESENT FEELINGS TOWARDS
HIM
EASY FOR YOU TO TALK EXCLAIMED MISS KEELDAR WHO WAS BEGINNING TO WAX
WARM IN HER TENANT'S CAUSE YOU WHOSE FAMILY HAVE LIVED AT BRIARMAINS
FOR SIX GENERATIONS TO WHOSE PERSON THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED FOR
FIFTY YEARS WHO KNOW ALL THEIR WAYS PREJUDICES AND PREFERENCES EASY
INDEED FOR YOU TO ACT SO AS TO AVOID OFFENDING THEM
BUT MR
MOORE
CAME A STRANGER INTO THE DISTRICT HE CAME HERE POOR AND FRIENDLESS
WITH NOTHING BUT HIS OWN ENERGIES TO BACK HIM NOTHING BUT HIS HONOUR
HIS TALENT AND HIS INDUSTRY TO MAKE HIS WAY FOR HIM
A MONSTROUS CRIME
INDEED THAT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES HE COULD NOT POPULARIZE HIS
NATURALLY GRAVE QUIET MANNERS ALL AT ONCE COULD NOT BE JOCULAR AND
FREE AND CORDIAL WITH A STRANGE PEASANTRY AS YOU ARE WITH YOUR
FELLOW TOWNSMEN AN UNPARDONABLE TRANSGRESSION THAT WHEN HE INTRODUCED
IMPROVEMENTS HE DID NOT GO ABOUT THE BUSINESS IN QUITE THE MOST POLITIC
WAY DID NOT GRADUATE HIS CHANGES AS DELICATELY AS A RICH CAPITALIST
MIGHT HAVE DONE FOR ERRORS OF THIS SORT IS HE TO BE THE VICTIM OF MOB
OUTRAGE IS HE TO BE DENIED EVEN THE PRIVILEGE OF DEFENDING HIMSELF ARE
THOSE WHO HAVE THE HEARTS OF MEN IN THEIR BREASTS AND MR
HELSTONE SAY
WHAT YOU WILL OF HIM HAS SUCH A HEART TO BE REVILED LIKE MALEFACTORS
BECAUSE THEY STAND BY HIM BECAUSE THEY VENTURE TO ESPOUSE THE CAUSE OF
ONE AGAINST TWO HUNDRED
COME COME NOW BE COOL SAID MR
YORKE SMILING AT THE EARNESTNESS
WITH WHICH SHIRLEY MULTIPLIED HER RAPID QUESTIONS
COOL MUST I LISTEN COOLLY TO DOWNRIGHT NONSENSE TO DANGEROUS
NONSENSE NO
I LIKE YOU VERY WELL MR
YORKE AS YOU KNOW BUT I
THOROUGHLY DISLIKE SOME OF YOUR PRINCIPLES
ALL THAT CANT EXCUSE ME
BUT I REPEAT THE WORD ALL THAT CANT ABOUT SOLDIERS AND PARSONS IS
MOST OFFENSIVE IN MY EARS
ALL RIDICULOUS IRRATIONAL CRYING UP OF ONE
CLASS WHETHER THE SAME BE ARISTOCRAT OR DEMOCRAT ALL HOWLING DOWN OF
ANOTHER CLASS WHETHER CLERICAL OR MILITARY ALL EXACTING INJUSTICE TO
INDIVIDUALS WHETHER MONARCH OR MENDICANT IS REALLY SICKENING TO ME
ALL ARRAYING OF RANKS AGAINST RANKS ALL PARTY HATREDS ALL TYRANNIES
DISGUISED AS LIBERTIES I REJECT AND WASH MY HANDS OF
YOU THINK YOU
ARE A PHILANTHROPIST YOU THINK YOU ARE AN ADVOCATE OF LIBERTY BUT I
WILL TELL YOU THIS MR
HALL THE PARSON OF NUNNELY IS A BETTER FRIEND
BOTH OF MAN AND FREEDOM THAN HIRAM YORKE THE REFORMER OF BRIARFIELD
FROM A MAN MR
YORKE WOULD NOT HAVE BORNE THIS LANGUAGE VERY PATIENTLY
NOR WOULD HE HAVE ENDURED IT FROM SOME WOMEN BUT HE ACCOUNTED SHIRLEY
BOTH HONEST AND PRETTY AND HER PLAIN SPOKEN IRE AMUSED HIM
BESIDES HE
TOOK A SECRET PLEASURE IN HEARING HER DEFEND HER TENANT FOR WE HAVE
ALREADY INTIMATED HE HAD ROBERT MOORE'S INTEREST VERY MUCH AT HEART
MOREOVER IF HE WISHED TO AVENGE HIMSELF FOR HER SEVERITY HE KNEW THE
MEANS LAY IN HIS POWER A WORD HE BELIEVED WOULD SUFFICE TO TAME AND
SILENCE HER TO COVER HER FRANK FOREHEAD WITH THE ROSY SHADOW OF SHAME
AND VEIL THE GLOW OF HER EYE UNDER DOWN DROOPED LID AND LASH
WHAT MORE HAST THOU TO SAY HE INQUIRED AS SHE PAUSED RATHER IT
APPEARED TO TAKE BREATH THAN BECAUSE HER SUBJECT OR HER ZEAL WAS
EXHAUSTED
SAY MR
YORKE WAS THE ANSWER THE SPEAKER MEANTIME WALKING FAST FROM
WALL TO WALL OF THE OAK PARLOUR SAY I HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO SAY IF I
COULD GET IT OUT IN LUCID ORDER WHICH I NEVER CAN DO
I HAVE TO SAY
THAT YOUR VIEWS AND THOSE OF MOST EXTREME POLITICIANS ARE SUCH AS NONE
BUT MEN IN AN IRRESPONSIBLE POSITION CAN ADVOCATE THAT THEY ARE
PURELY OPPOSITION VIEWS MEANT ONLY TO BE TALKED ABOUT AND NEVER
INTENDED TO BE ACTED ON
MAKE YOU PRIME MINISTER OF ENGLAND TO MORROW
AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO ABANDON THEM
YOU ABUSE MOORE FOR DEFENDING HIS
MILL
HAD YOU BEEN IN MOORE'S PLACE YOU COULD NOT WITH HONOUR OR SENSE
HAVE ACTED OTHERWISE THAN HE ACTED
YOU ABUSE MR
HELSTONE FOR
EVERYTHING HE DOES
MR
HELSTONE HAS HIS FAULTS HE SOMETIMES DOES
WRONG BUT OFTENER RIGHT
WERE YOU ORDAINED VICAR OF BRIARFIELD YOU
WOULD FIND IT NO EASY TASK TO SUSTAIN ALL THE ACTIVE SCHEMES FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THE PARISH PLANNED AND PERSEVERED IN BY YOUR PREDECESSOR
I
WONDER PEOPLE CANNOT JUDGE MORE FAIRLY OF EACH OTHER AND THEMSELVES
WHEN I HEAR MESSRS
MALONE AND DONNE CHATTER ABOUT THE AUTHORITY OF THE
CHURCH THE DIGNITY AND CLAIMS OF THE PRIESTHOOD THE DEFERENCE DUE TO
THEM AS CLERGYMEN WHEN I HEAR THE OUTBREAKS OF THEIR SMALL SPITE
AGAINST DISSENTERS WHEN I WITNESS THEIR SILLY NARROW JEALOUSIES AND
ASSUMPTIONS WHEN THEIR PALAVER ABOUT FORMS AND TRADITIONS AND
SUPERSTITIONS IS SOUNDING IN MY EAR WHEN I BEHOLD THEIR INSOLENT
CARRIAGE TO THE POOR THEIR OFTEN BASE SERVILITY TO THE RICH I THINK
THE ESTABLISHMENT IS INDEED IN A POOR WAY AND BOTH SHE AND HER SONS
APPEAR IN THE UTMOST NEED OF REFORMATION
TURNING AWAY DISTRESSED FROM
MINSTER TOWER AND VILLAGE SPIRE AY AS DISTRESSED AS A CHURCHWARDEN WHO
FEELS THE EXIGENCE OF WHITE WASH AND HAS NOT WHEREWITHAL TO PURCHASE
LIME I RECALL YOUR SENSELESS SARCASMS ON THE 'FAT BISHOPS THE
'PAMPERED PARSONS 'OLD MOTHER CHURCH ETC
I REMEMBER YOUR STRICTURES
ON ALL WHO DIFFER FROM YOU YOUR SWEEPING CONDEMNATION OF CLASSES AND
INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST ALLOWANCE MADE FOR CIRCUMSTANCES OR
TEMPTATIONS AND THEN MR
YORKE DOUBT CLUTCHES MY INMOST HEART AS TO
WHETHER MEN EXIST CLEMENT REASONABLE AND JUST ENOUGH TO BE ENTRUSTED
WITH THE TASK OF REFORM
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU ARE OF THE NUMBER
YOU HAVE AN ILL OPINION OF ME MISS SHIRLEY
YOU NEVER TOLD ME SO MUCH
OF YOUR MIND BEFORE
I NEVER HAD AN OPENING
BUT I HAVE SAT ON JESSY'S STOOL BY YOUR CHAIR
IN THE BACK PARLOUR AT BRIARMAINS FOR EVENINGS TOGETHER LISTENING
EXCITEDLY TO YOUR TALK HALF ADMIRING WHAT YOU SAID AND HALF REBELLING
AGAINST IT
I THINK YOU A FINE OLD YORKSHIREMAN SIR
I AM PROUD TO HAVE
BEEN BORN IN THE SAME COUNTY AND PARISH AS YOURSELF
TRUTHFUL UPRIGHT
INDEPENDENT YOU ARE AS A ROCK BASED BELOW SEAS BUT ALSO YOU ARE HARSH
RUDE NARROW AND MERCILESS
NOT TO THE POOR LASS NOR TO THE MEEK OF THE EARTH ONLY TO THE PROUD
AND HIGH MINDED
AND WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU SIR TO MAKE SUCH DISTINCTIONS A PROUDER A
HIGHER MINDED MAN THAN YOURSELF DOES NOT EXIST
YOU FIND IT EASY TO
SPEAK COMFORTABLY TO YOUR INFERIORS YOU ARE TOO HAUGHTY TOO AMBITIOUS
TOO JEALOUS TO BE CIVIL TO THOSE ABOVE YOU
BUT YOU ARE ALL ALIKE
HELSTONE ALSO IS PROUD AND PREJUDICED
MOORE THOUGH JUSTER AND MORE
CONSIDERATE THAN EITHER YOU OR THE RECTOR IS STILL HAUGHTY STERN AND
IN A PUBLIC SENSE SELFISH
IT IS WELL THERE ARE SUCH MEN AS MR
HALL TO
BE FOUND OCCASIONALLY MEN OF LARGE AND KIND HEARTS WHO CAN LOVE THEIR
WHOLE RACE WHO CAN FORGIVE OTHERS FOR BEING RICHER MORE PROSPEROUS OR
MORE POWERFUL THAN THEY ARE
SUCH MEN MAY HAVE LESS ORIGINALITY LESS
FORCE OF CHARACTER THAN YOU BUT THEY ARE BETTER FRIENDS TO MANKIND
AND WHEN IS IT TO BE SAID MR
YORKE NOW RISING
WHEN IS WHAT TO BE
THE WEDDING
WHOSE WEDDING
ONLY THAT OF ROBERT GRARD MOORE ESQ OF HOLLOW'S COTTAGE WITH MISS
KEELDAR DAUGHTER AND HEIRESS OF THE LATE CHARLES CAVE KEELDAR OF
FIELDHEAD HALL
SHIRLEY GAZED AT THE QUESTIONER WITH RISING COLOUR
BUT THE LIGHT IN HER
EYE WAS NOT FALTERING IT SHONE STEADILY YES IT BURNED DEEPLY
THAT IS YOUR REVENGE SHE SAID SLOWLY THEN ADDED WOULD IT BE A BAD
MATCH UNWORTHY OF THE LATE CHARLES CAVE KEELDAR'S REPRESENTATIVE
MY LASS MOORE IS A GENTLEMAN HIS BLOOD IS PURE AND ANCIENT AS MINE OR
THINE
AND WE TWO SET STORE BY ANCIENT BLOOD WE HAVE FAMILY PRIDE THOUGH ONE
OF US AT LEAST IS A REPUBLICAN
YORKE BOWED AS HE STOOD BEFORE HER
HIS LIPS WERE MUTE BUT HIS EYE
CONFESSED THE IMPEACHMENT
YES HE HAD FAMILY PRIDE YOU SAW IT IN HIS
WHOLE BEARING
MOORE IS A GENTLEMAN ECHOED SHIRLEY LIFTING HER HEAD WITH GLAD
GRACE
SHE CHECKED HERSELF
WORDS SEEMED CROWDING TO HER TONGUE
SHE
WOULD NOT GIVE THEM UTTERANCE BUT HER LOOK SPOKE MUCH AT THE MOMENT
WHAT YORKE TRIED TO READ BUT COULD NOT
THE LANGUAGE WAS THERE
VISIBLE BUT UNTRANSLATABLE A POEM A FERVID LYRIC IN AN UNKNOWN
TONGUE
IT WAS NOT A PLAIN STORY HOWEVER NO SIMPLE GUSH OF FEELING NO
ORDINARY LOVE CONFESSION THAT WAS OBVIOUS
IT WAS SOMETHING OTHER
DEEPER MORE INTRICATE THAN HE GUESSED AT
HE FELT HIS REVENGE HAD NOT
STRUCK HOME
HE FELT THAT SHIRLEY TRIUMPHED
SHE HELD HIM AT FAULT
BAFFLED PUZZLED
SHE ENJOYED THE MOMENT NOT HE
AND IF MOORE IS A GENTLEMAN YOU CAN BE ONLY A LADY THEREFORE
THEREFORE THERE WOULD BE NO INEQUALITY IN OUR UNION
NONE
THANK YOU FOR YOUR APPROBATION
WILL YOU GIVE ME AWAY WHEN I RELINQUISH
THE NAME OF KEELDAR FOR THAT OF MOORE
MR
YORKE INSTEAD OF REPLYING GAZED AT HER MUCH PUZZLED
HE COULD NOT
DIVINE WHAT HER LOOK SIGNIFIED WHETHER SHE SPOKE IN EARNEST OR IN JEST
THERE WERE PURPOSE AND FEELING BANTER AND SCOFF PLAYING MINGLED ON
HER MOBILE LINEAMENTS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEE HE SAID TURNING AWAY
SHE LAUGHED
TAKE COURAGE SIR YOU ARE NOT SINGULAR IN YOUR IGNORANCE
BUT I SUPPOSE IF MOORE UNDERSTANDS ME THAT WILL DO WILL IT NOT
MOORE MAY SETTLE HIS OWN MATTERS HENCEFORWARD FOR ME I'LL NEITHER
MEDDLE NOR MAKE WITH THEM FURTHER
A NEW THOUGHT CROSSED HER
HER COUNTENANCE CHANGED MAGICALLY
WITH A
SUDDEN DARKENING OF THE EYE AND AUSTERE FIXING OF THE FEATURES SHE
DEMANDED HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED TO INTERFERE ARE YOU QUESTIONING ME AS
ANOTHER'S PROXY
THE LORD SAVE US WHOEVER WEDS THEE MUST LOOK ABOUT HIM KEEP ALL YOUR
QUESTIONS FOR ROBERT I'LL ANSWER NO MORE ON 'EM
GOOD DAY LASSIE
THE DAY BEING FINE OR AT LEAST FAIR FOR SOFT CLOUDS CURTAINED THE SUN
AND A DIM BUT NOT CHILL OR WATERISH HAZE SLEPT BLUE ON THE
HILLS CAROLINE WHILE SHIRLEY WAS ENGAGED WITH HER CALLERS HAD
PERSUADED MRS
PRYOR TO ASSUME HER BONNET AND SUMMER SHAWL AND TO TAKE
A WALK WITH HER UP TOWARDS THE NARROW END OF THE HOLLOW
HERE THE OPPOSING SIDES OF THE GLEN APPROACHING EACH OTHER AND BECOMING
CLOTHED WITH BRUSHWOOD AND STUNTED OAKS FORMED A WOODED RAVINE AT THE
BOTTOM OF WHICH RAN THE MILL STREAM IN BROKEN UNQUIET COURSE
STRUGGLING WITH MANY STONES CHAFING AGAINST RUGGED BANKS FRETTING WITH
GNARLED TREE ROOTS FOAMING GURGLING BATTLING AS IT WENT
HERE WHEN
YOU HAD WANDERED HALF A MILE FROM THE MILL YOU FOUND A SENSE OF DEEP
SOLITUDE FOUND IT IN THE SHADE OF UNMOLESTED TREES RECEIVED IT IN THE
SINGING OF MANY BIRDS FOR WHICH THAT SHADE MADE A HOME
THIS WAS NO
TRODDEN WAY
THE FRESHNESS OF THE WOOD FLOWERS ATTESTED THAT FOOT OF MAN
SELDOM PRESSED THEM THE ABOUNDING WILD ROSES LOOKED AS IF THEY BUDDED
BLOOMED AND FADED UNDER THE WATCH OF SOLITUDE AS IF IN A SULTAN'S
HAREM
HERE YOU SAW THE SWEET AZURE OF BLUE BELLS AND RECOGNIZED IN
PEARL WHITE BLOSSOMS SPANGLING THE GRASS A HUMBLE TYPE OF SOME STARLIT
SPOT IN SPACE
MRS
PRYOR LIKED A QUIET WALK
SHE EVER SHUNNED HIGH ROADS AND SOUGHT
BYWAYS AND LONELY LANES
ONE COMPANION SHE PREFERRED TO TOTAL SOLITUDE
FOR IN SOLITUDE SHE WAS NERVOUS A VAGUE FEAR OF ANNOYING ENCOUNTERS
BROKE THE ENJOYMENT OF QUITE LONELY RAMBLES
BUT SHE FEARED NOTHING WITH
CAROLINE
WHEN ONCE SHE GOT AWAY FROM HUMAN HABITATIONS AND ENTERED
THE STILL DEMESNE OF NATURE ACCOMPANIED BY THIS ONE YOUTHFUL FRIEND A
PROPITIOUS CHANGE SEEMED TO STEAL OVER HER MIND AND BEAM IN HER
COUNTENANCE
WHEN WITH CAROLINE AND CAROLINE ONLY HER HEART YOU WOULD
HAVE SAID SHOOK OFF A BURDEN HER BROW PUT ASIDE A VEIL HER SPIRITS
TOO ESCAPED FROM A RESTRAINT
WITH HER SHE WAS CHEERFUL WITH HER AT
TIMES SHE WAS TENDER TO HER SHE WOULD IMPART HER KNOWLEDGE REVEAL
GLIMPSES OF HER EXPERIENCE GIVE HER OPPORTUNITIES FOR GUESSING WHAT
LIFE SHE HAD LIVED WHAT CULTIVATION HER MIND HAD RECEIVED OF WHAT
CALIBRE WAS HER INTELLIGENCE HOW AND WHERE HER FEELINGS WERE
VULNERABLE
TO DAY FOR INSTANCE AS THEY WALKED ALONG MRS
PRYOR TALKED TO HER
COMPANION ABOUT THE VARIOUS BIRDS SINGING IN THE TREES DISCRIMINATED
THEIR SPECIES AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR HABITS AND PECULIARITIES
ENGLISH NATURAL HISTORY SEEMED FAMILIAR TO HER
ALL THE WILD FLOWERS
ROUND THEIR PATH WERE RECOGNIZED BY HER TINY PLANTS SPRINGING NEAR
STONES AND PEEPING OUT OF CHINKS IN OLD WALLS PLANTS SUCH AS CAROLINE
HAD SCARCELY NOTICED BEFORE RECEIVED A NAME AND AN INTIMATION OF THEIR
PROPERTIES
IT APPEARED THAT SHE HAD MINUTELY STUDIED THE BOTANY OF
ENGLISH FIELDS AND WOODS
HAVING REACHED THE HEAD OF THE RAVINE THEY
SAT DOWN TOGETHER ON A LEDGE OF GRAY AND MOSSY ROCK JUTTING FROM THE
BASE OF A STEEP GREEN HILL WHICH TOWERED ABOVE THEM
SHE LOOKED ROUND
HER AND SPOKE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AS SHE HAD ONCE BEFORE SEEN IT LONG
AGO
SHE ALLUDED TO ITS CHANGES AND COMPARED ITS ASPECT WITH THAT OF
OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND REVEALING IN QUIET UNCONSCIOUS TOUCHES OF
DESCRIPTION A SENSE OF THE PICTURESQUE AN APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL
OR COMMONPLACE A POWER OF COMPARING THE WILD WITH THE CULTURED THE
GRAND WITH THE TAME THAT GAVE TO HER DISCOURSE A GRAPHIC CHARM AS
PLEASANT AS IT WAS UNPRETENDING
THE SORT OF REVERENT PLEASURE WITH WHICH CAROLINE LISTENED SO SINCERE
SO QUIET YET SO EVIDENT STIRRED THE ELDER LADY'S FACULTIES TO GENTLE
ANIMATION
RARELY PROBABLY HAD SHE WITH HER CHILL REPELLENT OUTSIDE
HER DIFFIDENT MIEN AND INCOMMUNICATIVE HABITS KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO
EXCITE IN ONE WHOM SHE HERSELF COULD LOVE FEELINGS OF EARNEST AFFECTION
AND ADMIRING ESTEEM
DELIGHTFUL DOUBTLESS WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT A
YOUNG GIRL TOWARDS WHOM IT SEEMED JUDGING BY THE MOVED EXPRESSION OF
HER EYES AND FEATURES HER HEART TURNED WITH ALMOST A FOND IMPULSE
LOOKED UP TO HER AS AN INSTRUCTOR AND CLUNG TO HER AS A FRIEND
WITH A
SOMEWHAT MORE MARKED ACCENT OF INTEREST THAN SHE OFTEN PERMITTED HERSELF
TO USE SHE SAID AS SHE BENT TOWARDS HER YOUTHFUL COMPANION AND PUT
ASIDE FROM HER FOREHEAD A PALE BROWN CURL WHICH HAD STRAYED FROM THE
CONFINING COMB I DO HOPE THIS SWEET AIR BLOWING FROM THE HILL WILL DO
YOU GOOD MY DEAR CAROLINE
I WISH I COULD SEE SOMETHING MORE OF COLOUR
IN THESE CHEEKS BUT PERHAPS YOU WERE NEVER FLORID
I HAD RED CHEEKS ONCE RETURNED MISS HELSTONE SMILING
I REMEMBER A
YEAR TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I USED TO LOOK IN THE GLASS I SAW A DIFFERENT
FACE THERE TO WHAT I SEE NOW ROUNDER AND ROSIER
BUT WHEN WE ARE
YOUNG ADDED THE GIRL OF EIGHTEEN OUR MINDS ARE CARELESS AND OUR
LIVES EASY
DO YOU CONTINUED MRS
PRYOR MASTERING BY AN EFFORT THAT TYRANT
TIMIDITY WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR HER EVEN UNDER PRESENT
CIRCUMSTANCES TO ATTEMPT THE SCRUTINY OF ANOTHER'S HEART DO YOU AT
YOUR AGE FRET YOURSELF WITH CARES FOR THE FUTURE BELIEVE ME YOU HAD
BETTER NOT
LET THE MORROW TAKE THOUGHT FOR THE THINGS OF ITSELF
TRUE DEAR MADAM
IT IS NOT OVER THE FUTURE I PINE
THE EVIL OF THE DAY
IS SOMETIMES OPPRESSIVE TOO OPPRESSIVE AND I LONG TO ESCAPE IT
THAT IS THE EVIL OF THE DAY THAT IS YOUR UNCLE PERHAPS IS NOT YOU
FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HE DOES NOT APPRECIATE
MRS
PRYOR COULD NOT COMPLETE HER BROKEN SENTENCES SHE COULD NOT MANAGE
TO PUT THE QUESTION WHETHER MR
HELSTONE WAS TOO HARSH WITH HIS NIECE
BUT CAROLINE COMPREHENDED
OH THAT IS NOTHING SHE REPLIED
MY UNCLE AND I GET ON VERY WELL
WE
NEVER QUARREL I DON'T CALL HIM HARSH HE NEVER SCOLDS ME
SOMETIMES I
WISH SOMEBODY IN THE WORLD LOVED ME BUT I CANNOT SAY THAT I
PARTICULARLY WISH HIM TO HAVE MORE AFFECTION FOR ME THAN HE HAS
AS A
CHILD I SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE FELT THE WANT OF ATTENTION ONLY THE
SERVANTS WERE VERY KIND TO ME BUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE LONG INDIFFERENT TO
US WE GROW INDIFFERENT TO THEIR INDIFFERENCE
IT IS MY UNCLE'S WAY NOT
TO CARE FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS UNLESS THEY BE LADIES THAT HE MEETS IN
COMPANY
HE COULD NOT ALTER AND I HAVE NO WISH THAT HE SHOULD ALTER AS
FAR AS I AM CONCERNED
I BELIEVE IT WOULD MERELY ANNOY AND FRIGHTEN ME
WERE HE TO BE AFFECTIONATE TOWARDS ME NOW
BUT YOU KNOW MRS
PRYOR IT
IS SCARCELY LIVING TO MEASURE TIME AS I DO AT THE RECTORY
THE HOURS
PASS AND I GET THEM OVER SOMEHOW BUT I DO NOT LIVE
I ENDURE
EXISTENCE BUT I RARELY ENJOY IT
SINCE MISS KEELDAR AND YOU CAME I HAVE
BEEN I WAS GOING TO SAY HAPPIER BUT THAT WOULD BE UNTRUE SHE PAUSED
HOW UNTRUE YOU ARE FOND OF MISS KEELDAR ARE YOU NOT MY DEAR
VERY FOND OF SHIRLEY
I BOTH LIKE AND ADMIRE HER
BUT I AM PAINFULLY
CIRCUMSTANCED
FOR A REASON I CANNOT EXPLAIN I WANT TO GO AWAY FROM THIS
PLACE AND TO FORGET IT
YOU TOLD ME BEFORE YOU WISHED TO BE A GOVERNESS BUT MY DEAR IF YOU
REMEMBER I DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE IDEA
I HAVE BEEN A GOVERNESS MYSELF
GREAT PART OF MY LIFE
IN MISS KEELDAR'S ACQUAINTANCE I ESTEEM MYSELF
MOST FORTUNATE
HER TALENTS AND HER REALLY SWEET DISPOSITION HAVE
RENDERED MY OFFICE EASY TO ME BUT WHEN I WAS YOUNG BEFORE I MARRIED
MY TRIALS WERE SEVERE POIGNANT
I SHOULD NOT LIKE A I SHOULD NOT
LIKE YOU TO ENDURE SIMILAR ONES
IT WAS MY LOT TO ENTER A FAMILY OF
CONSIDERABLE PRETENSIONS TO GOOD BIRTH AND MENTAL SUPERIORITY AND THE
MEMBERS OF WHICH ALSO BELIEVED THAT 'ON THEM WAS PERCEPTIBLE' AN UNUSUAL
ENDOWMENT OF THE 'CHRISTIAN GRACES THAT ALL THEIR HEARTS WERE
REGENERATE AND THEIR SPIRITS IN A PECULIAR STATE OF DISCIPLINE
I WAS
EARLY GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT 'AS I WAS NOT THEIR EQUAL SO I COULD
NOT EXPECT 'TO HAVE THEIR SYMPATHY IT WAS IN NO SORT CONCEALED FROM ME
THAT I WAS HELD A 'BURDEN AND A RESTRAINT IN SOCIETY THE GENTLEMEN I
FOUND REGARDED ME AS A 'TABOOED WOMAN TO WHOM 'THEY WERE INTERDICTED
FROM GRANTING THE USUAL PRIVILEGES OF THE SEX AND YET 'WHO ANNOYED
THEM BY FREQUENTLY CROSSING THEIR PATH THE LADIES TOO MADE IT PLAIN
THAT THEY THOUGHT ME 'A BORE THE SERVANTS IT WAS SIGNIFIED 'DETESTED
ME WHY I COULD NEVER CLEARLY COMPREHEND
MY PUPILS I WAS TOLD
'HOWEVER MUCH THEY MIGHT LOVE ME AND HOW DEEP SOEVER THE INTEREST I
MIGHT TAKE IN THEM COULD NOT BE MY FRIENDS IT WAS INTIMATED THAT I
MUST 'LIVE ALONE AND NEVER TRANSGRESS THE INVISIBLE BUT RIGID LINE
WHICH ESTABLISHED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND MY EMPLOYERS MY LIFE
IN THIS HOUSE WAS SEDENTARY SOLITARY CONSTRAINED JOYLESS TOILSOME
THE DREADFUL CRUSHING OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS THE EVER PREVAILING SENSE
OF FRIENDLESSNESS AND HOMELESSNESS CONSEQUENT ON THIS STATE OF THINGS
BEGAN ERE LONG TO PRODUCE MORTAL EFFECTS ON MY CONSTITUTION
I SICKENED
THE LADY OF THE HOUSE TOLD ME COOLLY I WAS THE VICTIM OF 'WOUNDED
VANITY SHE HINTED THAT IF I DID NOT MAKE AN EFFORT TO QUELL MY
'UNGODLY DISCONTENT TO CEASE 'MURMURING AGAINST GOD'S APPOINTMENT
AND TO CULTIVATE THE PROFOUND HUMILITY BEFITTING MY STATION MY MIND
WOULD VERY LIKELY 'GO TO PIECES' ON THE ROCK THAT WRECKED MOST OF MY
SISTERHOOD MORBID SELF ESTEEM AND THAT I SHOULD DIE AN INMATE OF A
LUNATIC ASYLUM
I SAID NOTHING TO MRS
HARDMAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS BUT TO HER
ELDEST DAUGHTER I ONE DAY DROPPED A FEW OBSERVATIONS WHICH WERE
ANSWERED THUS
THERE WERE HARDSHIPS SHE ALLOWED IN THE POSITION OF A
GOVERNESS
'DOUBTLESS THEY HAD THEIR TRIALS BUT SHE AVERRED WITH A
MANNER IT MAKES ME SMILE NOW TO RECALL 'BUT IT MUST BE SO
SHE MISS
H 'HAD NEITHER VIEW HOPE NOR WISH TO SEE THESE THINGS REMEDIED
FOR IN THE INHERENT CONSTITUTION OF ENGLISH HABITS FEELINGS AND
PREJUDICES THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY THAT THEY SHOULD BE
GOVERNESSES
SHE OBSERVED 'MUST EVER BE KEPT IN A SORT OF ISOLATION
IT IS THE ONLY
MEANS OF MAINTAINING THAT DISTANCE WHICH THE RESERVE OF ENGLISH MANNERS
AND THE DECORUM OF ENGLISH FAMILIES EXACT
I REMEMBER I SIGHED AS MISS HARDMAN QUITTED MY BEDSIDE
SHE CAUGHT THE
SOUND AND TURNING SAID SEVERELY 'I FEAR MISS GREY YOU HAVE
INHERITED IN FULLEST MEASURE THE WORST SIN OF OUR FALLEN NATURE THE SIN
OF PRIDE
YOU ARE PROUD AND THEREFORE YOU ARE UNGRATEFUL TOO
MAMMA
PAYS YOU A HANDSOME SALARY AND IF YOU HAD AVERAGE SENSE YOU WOULD
THANKFULLY PUT UP WITH MUCH THAT IS FATIGUING TO DO AND IRKSOME TO BEAR
SINCE IT IS SO WELL MADE WORTH YOUR WHILE
MISS HARDMAN MY LOVE WAS A VERY STRONG MINDED YOUNG LADY OF MOST
DISTINGUISHED TALENTS
THE ARISTOCRACY ARE DECIDEDLY A VERY SUPERIOR
CLASS YOU KNOW BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MORALLY AND MENTALLY AS A HIGH
TORY I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
I COULD NOT DESCRIBE THE DIGNITY OF HER VOICE
AND MIEN AS SHE ADDRESSED ME THUS STILL I FEAR SHE WAS SELFISH MY
DEAR
I WOULD NEVER WISH TO SPEAK ILL OF MY SUPERIORS IN RANK BUT I
THINK SHE WAS A LITTLE SELFISH
I REMEMBER CONTINUED MRS
PRYOR AFTER A PAUSE ANOTHER OF MISS H 'S
OBSERVATIONS WHICH SHE WOULD UTTER WITH QUITE A GRAND AIR
'WE SHE
WOULD SAY 'WE NEED THE IMPRUDENCES EXTRAVAGANCES MISTAKES AND CRIMES
OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FATHERS TO SOW THE SEED FROM WHICH WE REAP THE
HARVEST OF GOVERNESSES
THE DAUGHTERS OF TRADES PEOPLE HOWEVER WELL
EDUCATED MUST NECESSARILY BE UNDERBRED AND AS SUCH UNFIT TO BE
INMATES OF OUR DWELLINGS OR GUARDIANS OF OUR CHILDREN'S MINDS AND
PERSONS
WE SHALL EVER PREFER TO PLACE THOSE ABOUT OUR OFFSPRING WHO
HAVE BEEN BORN AND BRED WITH SOMEWHAT OF THE SAME REFINEMENT AS
OURSELVES
MISS HARDMAN MUST HAVE THOUGHT HERSELF SOMETHING BETTER THAN HER
FELLOW CREATURES MA'AM SINCE SHE HELD THAT THEIR CALAMITIES AND EVEN
CRIMES WERE NECESSARY TO MINISTER TO HER CONVENIENCE
YOU SAY SHE WAS
RELIGIOUS
HER RELIGION MUST HAVE BEEN THAT OF THE PHARISEE WHO THANKED
GOD THAT HE WAS NOT AS OTHER MEN ARE NOR EVEN AS THAT PUBLICAN
MY DEAR WE WILL NOT DISCUSS THE POINT
I SHOULD BE THE LAST PERSON TO
WISH TO INSTIL INTO YOUR MIND ANY FEELING OF DISSATISFACTION WITH YOUR
LOT IN LIFE OR ANY SENTIMENT OF ENVY OR INSUBORDINATION TOWARDS YOUR
SUPERIORS
IMPLICIT SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITIES SCRUPULOUS DEFERENCE TO
OUR BETTERS UNDER WHICH TERM I OF COURSE INCLUDE THE HIGHER CLASSES
OF SOCIETY ARE IN MY OPINION INDISPENSABLE TO THE WELL BEING OF
EVERY COMMUNITY
ALL I MEAN TO SAY MY DEAR IS THAT YOU HAD BETTER NOT
ATTEMPT TO BE A GOVERNESS AS THE DUTIES OF THE POSITION WOULD BE TOO
SEVERE FOR YOUR CONSTITUTION
NOT ONE WORD OF DISRESPECT WOULD I BREATHE
TOWARDS EITHER MRS
OR MISS HARDMAN ONLY RECALLING MY OWN EXPERIENCE
I CANNOT BUT FEEL THAT WERE YOU TO FALL UNDER AUSPICES SUCH AS THEIRS
YOU WOULD CONTEND A WHILE COURAGEOUSLY WITH YOUR DOOM THEN YOU WOULD
PINE AND GROW TOO WEAK FOR YOUR WORK YOU WOULD COME HOME IF YOU STILL
HAD A HOME BROKEN DOWN
THOSE LANGUISHING YEARS WOULD FOLLOW OF WHICH
NONE BUT THE INVALID AND HER IMMEDIATE FRIENDS FEEL THE HEART SICKNESS
AND KNOW THE BURDEN
CONSUMPTION OR DECLINE WOULD CLOSE THE CHAPTER
SUCH IS THE HISTORY OF MANY A LIFE
I WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOURS
MY DEAR
WE WILL NOW WALK ABOUT A LITTLE IF YOU PLEASE
THEY BOTH ROSE AND SLOWLY PACED A GREEN NATURAL TERRACE BORDERING THE
CHASM
MY DEAR ERE LONG AGAIN BEGAN MRS
PRYOR A SORT OF TIMID EMBARRASSED
ABRUPTNESS MARKING HER MANNER AS SHE SPOKE THE YOUNG ESPECIALLY THOSE
TO WHOM NATURE HAS BEEN FAVOURABLE OFTEN FREQUENTLY ANTICIPATE LOOK
FORWARD TO TO MARRIAGE AS THE END THE GOAL OF THEIR HOPES
AND SHE STOPPED
CAROLINE CAME TO HER RELIEF WITH PROMPTITUDE SHOWING A
GREAT DEAL MORE SELF POSSESSION AND COURAGE THAN HERSELF ON THE
FORMIDABLE TOPIC NOW BROACHED
THEY DO AND NATURALLY SHE REPLIED WITH A CALM EMPHASIS THAT
STARTLED MRS
PRYOR
THEY LOOK FORWARD TO MARRIAGE WITH SOME ONE THEY
LOVE AS THE BRIGHTEST THE ONLY BRIGHT DESTINY THAT CAN AWAIT THEM
ARE
THEY WRONG
OH MY DEAR EXCLAIMED MRS
PRYOR CLASPING HER HANDS AND AGAIN SHE
PAUSED
CAROLINE TURNED A SEARCHING AN EAGER EYE ON THE FACE OF HER
FRIEND THAT FACE WAS MUCH AGITATED
MY DEAR SHE MURMURED LIFE IS
AN ILLUSION
BUT NOT LOVE LOVE IS REAL THE MOST REAL THE MOST LASTING THE
SWEETEST AND YET THE BITTEREST THING WE KNOW
MY DEAR IT IS VERY BITTER
IT IS SAID TO BE STRONG STRONG AS DEATH
MOST OF THE CHEATS OF EXISTENCE ARE STRONG
AS TO THEIR SWEETNESS
NOTHING IS SO TRANSITORY ITS DATE IS A MOMENT THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
THE STING REMAINS FOR EVER
IT MAY PERISH WITH THE DAWN OF ETERNITY BUT
IT TORTURES THROUGH TIME INTO ITS DEEPEST NIGHT
YES IT TORTURES THROUGH TIME AGREED CAROLINE EXCEPT WHEN IT IS
MUTUAL LOVE
MUTUAL LOVE MY DEAR ROMANCES ARE PERNICIOUS
YOU DO NOT READ THEM I
HOPE
SOMETIMES WHENEVER I CAN GET THEM INDEED
BUT ROMANCE WRITERS MIGHT
KNOW NOTHING OF LOVE JUDGING BY THE WAY IN WHICH THEY TREAT OF IT
NOTHING WHATEVER MY DEAR ASSENTED MRS
PRYOR EAGERLY NOR OF
MARRIAGE AND THE FALSE PICTURES THEY GIVE OF THOSE SUBJECTS CANNOT BE
TOO STRONGLY CONDEMNED
THEY ARE NOT LIKE REALITY
THEY SHOW YOU ONLY
THE GREEN TEMPTING SURFACE OF THE MARSH AND GIVE NOT ONE FAITHFUL OR
TRUTHFUL HINT OF THE SLOUGH UNDERNEATH
BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS SLOUGH OBJECTED CAROLINE
THERE ARE HAPPY
MARRIAGES
WHERE AFFECTION IS RECIPROCAL AND SINCERE AND MINDS ARE
HARMONIOUS MARRIAGE MUST BE HAPPY
IT IS NEVER WHOLLY HAPPY
TWO PEOPLE CAN NEVER LITERALLY BE AS ONE
THERE IS PERHAPS A POSSIBILITY OF CONTENT UNDER PECULIAR
CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS ARE SELDOM COMBINED BUT IT IS AS WELL NOT TO RUN
THE RISK YOU MAY MAKE FATAL MISTAKES
BE SATISFIED MY DEAR
LET ALL
THE SINGLE BE SATISFIED WITH THEIR FREEDOM
YOU ECHO MY UNCLE'S WORDS EXCLAIMED CAROLINE IN A TONE OF DISMAY
YOU SPEAK LIKE MRS
YORKE IN HER MOST GLOOMY MOMENTS LIKE MISS MANN
WHEN SHE IS MOST SOURLY AND HYPOCHONDRIACALLY DISPOSED
THIS IS
TERRIBLE
NO IT IS ONLY TRUE
O CHILD YOU HAVE ONLY LIVED THE PLEASANT MORNING
TIME OF LIFE THE HOT WEARY NOON THE SAD EVENING THE SUNLESS NIGHT
ARE YET TO COME FOR YOU
MR
HELSTONE YOU SAY TALKS AS I TALK AND I
WONDER HOW MRS
MATTHEWSON HELSTONE WOULD HAVE TALKED HAD SHE BEEN
LIVING
SHE DIED SHE DIED
AND ALAS MY OWN MOTHER AND FATHER EXCLAIMED CAROLINE STRUCK BY
A SOMBRE RECOLLECTION
WHAT OF THEM
DID I NEVER TELL YOU THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED
I HAVE HEARD IT
THEY MUST THEN HAVE BEEN VERY MISERABLE
YOU SEE ALL FACTS GO TO PROVE WHAT I SAY
IN THIS CASE THERE OUGHT TO BE NO SUCH THING AS MARRIAGE
THERE OUGHT MY DEAR WERE IT ONLY TO PROVE THAT THIS LIFE IS A MERE
STATE OF PROBATION WHEREIN NEITHER REST NOR RECOMPENSE IS TO BE
VOUCHSAFED
BUT YOUR OWN MARRIAGE MRS
PRYOR
MRS
PRYOR SHRANK AND SHUDDERED AS IF A RUDE FINGER HAD PRESSED A NAKED
NERVE
CAROLINE FELT SHE HAD TOUCHED WHAT WOULD NOT BEAR THE SLIGHTEST
CONTACT
MY MARRIAGE WAS UNHAPPY SAID THE LADY SUMMONING COURAGE AT LAST
BUT YET SHE HESITATED
BUT YET SUGGESTED CAROLINE NOT IMMITIGABLY WRETCHED
NOT IN ITS RESULTS AT LEAST
NO SHE ADDED IN A SOFTER TONE GOD
MINGLES SOMETHING OF THE BALM OF MERCY EVEN IN VIALS OF THE MOST
CORROSIVE WOE
HE CAN SO TURN EVENTS THAT FROM THE VERY SAME BLIND RASH
ACT WHENCE SPRANG THE CURSE OF HALF OUR LIFE MAY FLOW THE BLESSING OF
THE REMAINDER
THEN I AM OF A PECULIAR DISPOSITION I OWN THAT FAR FROM
FACILE WITHOUT ADDRESS IN SOME POINTS ECCENTRIC
I OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE
MARRIED
MINE IS NOT THE NATURE EASILY TO FIND A DUPLICATE OR LIKELY TO
ASSIMILATE WITH A CONTRAST
I WAS QUITE AWARE OF MY OWN INELIGIBILITY
AND IF I HAD NOT BEEN SO MISERABLE AS A GOVERNESS I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
MARRIED AND THEN
CAROLINE'S EYES ASKED HER TO PROCEED
THEY ENTREATED HER TO BREAK THE
THICK CLOUD OF DESPAIR WHICH HER PREVIOUS WORDS HAD SEEMED TO SPREAD
OVER LIFE
AND THEN MY DEAR MR THAT IS THE GENTLEMAN I MARRIED WAS PERHAPS
RATHER AN EXCEPTIONAL THAN AN AVERAGE CHARACTER
I HOPE AT LEAST THE
EXPERIENCE OF FEW HAS BEEN SUCH AS MINE WAS OR THAT FEW HAVE FELT THEIR
SUFFERINGS AS I FELT MINE
THEY NEARLY SHOOK MY MIND RELIEF WAS SO
HOPELESS REDRESS SO UNATTAINABLE
BUT MY DEAR I DO NOT WISH TO
DISHEARTEN I ONLY WISH TO WARN YOU AND TO PROVE THAT THE SINGLE SHOULD
NOT BE TOO ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THEIR STATE AS THEY MAY CHANGE FOR THE
WORSE
THANK YOU MY DEAR MADAM
I QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR KIND INTENTIONS BUT
THERE IS NO FEAR OF MY FALLING INTO THE ERROR TO WHICH YOU ALLUDE
I AT
LEAST HAVE NO THOUGHTS OF MARRIAGE AND FOR THAT REASON I WANT TO MAKE
MYSELF A POSITION BY SOME OTHER MEANS
MY DEAR LISTEN TO ME
ON WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY I HAVE CAREFULLY
DELIBERATED HAVING INDEED REVOLVED THE SUBJECT IN MY THOUGHTS EVER
SINCE YOU FIRST MENTIONED YOUR WISH TO OBTAIN A SITUATION
YOU KNOW I AT
PRESENT RESIDE WITH MISS KEELDAR IN THE CAPACITY OF COMPANION
SHOULD
SHE MARRY AND THAT SHE WILL MARRY ERE LONG MANY CIRCUMSTANCES INDUCE
ME TO CONCLUDE I SHALL CEASE TO BE NECESSARY TO HER IN THAT CAPACITY
I MUST TELL YOU THAT I POSSESS A SMALL INDEPENDENCY ARISING PARTLY FROM
MY OWN SAVINGS AND PARTLY FROM A LEGACY LEFT ME SOME YEARS SINCE
WHENEVER I LEAVE FIELDHEAD I SHALL TAKE A HOUSE OF MY OWN
I COULD NOT
ENDURE TO LIVE IN SOLITUDE
I HAVE NO RELATIONS WHOM I CARE TO INVITE TO
CLOSE INTIMACY FOR AS YOU MUST HAVE OBSERVED AND AS I HAVE ALREADY
AVOWED MY HABITS AND TASTES HAVE THEIR PECULIARITIES
TO YOU MY DEAR
I NEED NOT SAY I AM ATTACHED WITH YOU I AM HAPPIER THAN I HAVE EVER
BEEN WITH ANY LIVING THING THIS WAS SAID WITH MARKED EMPHASIS
YOUR
SOCIETY I SHOULD ESTEEM A VERY DEAR PRIVILEGE AN INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE
A COMFORT A BLESSING
YOU SHALL COME TO ME THEN
CAROLINE DO YOU
REFUSE ME I HOPE YOU CAN LOVE ME
AND WITH THESE TWO ABRUPT QUESTIONS SHE STOPPED
INDEED I DO LOVE YOU WAS THE REPLY
I SHOULD LIKE TO LIVE WITH
YOU
BUT YOU ARE TOO KIND
ALL I HAVE WENT ON MRS
PRYOR I WOULD LEAVE TO YOU
YOU SHOULD BE
PROVIDED FOR
BUT NEVER AGAIN SAY I AM TOO KIND
YOU PIERCE MY HEART
CHILD
BUT MY DEAR MADAM THIS GENEROSITY I HAVE NO CLAIM
HUSH YOU MUST NOT TALK ABOUT IT
THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE CANNOT BEAR
TO HEAR
OH IT IS LATE TO BEGIN BUT I MAY YET LIVE A FEW YEARS
I CAN
NEVER WIPE OUT THE PAST BUT PERHAPS A BRIEF SPACE IN THE FUTURE MAY
YET BE MINE
MRS
PRYOR SEEMED DEEPLY AGITATED
LARGE TEARS TREMBLED IN HER EYES AND
ROLLED DOWN HER CHEEKS
CAROLINE KISSED HER IN HER GENTLE CARESSING
WAY SAYING SOFTLY I LOVE YOU DEARLY
DON'T CRY
BUT THE LADY'S WHOLE FRAME SEEMED SHAKEN
SHE SAT DOWN BENT HER HEAD TO
HER KNEE AND WEPT ALOUD
NOTHING COULD CONSOLE HER TILL THE INWARD
STORM HAD HAD ITS WAY
AT LAST THE AGONY SUBSIDED OF ITSELF
POOR THING SHE MURMURED RETURNING CAROLINE'S KISS POOR LONELY
LAMB BUT COME SHE ADDED ABRUPTLY COME WE MUST GO HOME
FOR A SHORT DISTANCE MRS
PRYOR WALKED VERY FAST
BY DEGREES HOWEVER
SHE CALMED DOWN TO HER WONTED MANNER FELL INTO HER USUAL CHARACTERISTIC
PACE A PECULIAR ONE LIKE ALL HER MOVEMENTS AND BY THE TIME THEY
REACHED FIELDHEAD SHE HAD RE ENTERED INTO HERSELF
THE OUTSIDE WAS AS
USUAL STILL AND SHY
CHAPTER XXII
TWO LIVES
ONLY HALF OF MOORE'S ACTIVITY AND RESOLUTION HAD BEEN SEEN IN HIS
DEFENCE OF THE MILL HE SHOWED THE OTHER HALF AND A TERRIBLE HALF IT
WAS IN THE INDEFATIGABLE THE RELENTLESS ASSIDUITY WITH WHICH HE
PURSUED THE LEADERS OF THE RIOT
THE MOB THE MERE FOLLOWERS HE LET
ALONE
PERHAPS AN INNATE SENSE OF JUSTICE TOLD HIM THAT MEN MISLED BY
FALSE COUNSEL AND GOADED BY PRIVATIONS ARE NOT FIT OBJECTS OF VENGEANCE
AND THAT HE WHO WOULD VISIT AN EVEN VIOLENT ACT ON THE BENT HEAD OF
SUFFERING IS A TYRANT NOT A JUDGE
AT ALL EVENTS THOUGH HE KNEW MANY
OF THE NUMBER HAVING RECOGNIZED THEM DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE
ATTACK WHEN DAY BEGAN TO DAWN HE LET THEM DAILY PASS HIM ON STREET AND
ROAD WITHOUT NOTICE OR THREAT
THE LEADERS HE DID NOT KNOW
THEY WERE STRANGERS EMISSARIES FROM THE
LARGE TOWNS
MOST OF THESE WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE OPERATIVE CLASS
THEY
WERE CHIEFLY DOWN DRAUGHTS BANKRUPTS MEN ALWAYS IN DEBT AND OFTEN IN
DRINK MEN WHO HAD NOTHING TO LOSE AND MUCH IN THE WAY OF CHARACTER
CASH AND CLEANLINESS TO GAIN
THESE PERSONS MOORE HUNTED LIKE ANY
SLEUTH HOUND AND WELL HE LIKED THE OCCUPATION
ITS EXCITEMENT WAS OF A
KIND PLEASANT TO HIS NATURE
HE LIKED IT BETTER THAN MAKING CLOTH
HIS HORSE MUST HAVE HATED THESE TIMES FOR IT WAS RIDDEN BOTH HARD AND
OFTEN
HE ALMOST LIVED ON THE ROAD AND THE FRESH AIR WAS AS WELCOME TO
HIS LUNGS AS THE POLICEMAN'S QUEST TO HIS MOOD HE PREFERRED IT TO THE
STEAM OF DYE HOUSES
THE MAGISTRATES OF THE DISTRICT MUST HAVE DREADED
HIM
THEY WERE SLOW TIMID MEN HE LIKED BOTH TO FRIGHTEN AND TO ROUSE
THEM
HE LIKED TO FORCE THEM TO BETRAY A CERTAIN FEAR WHICH MADE THEM
ALIKE FALTER IN RESOLVE AND RECOIL IN ACTION THE FEAR SIMPLY OF
ASSASSINATION
THIS INDEED WAS THE DREAD WHICH HAD HITHERTO HAMPERED
EVERY MANUFACTURER AND ALMOST EVERY PUBLIC MAN IN THE DISTRICT
HELSTONE
ALONE HAD EVER REPELLED IT
THE OLD COSSACK KNEW WELL HE MIGHT BE SHOT
HE KNEW THERE WAS RISK BUT SUCH DEATH HAD FOR HIS NERVES NO TERRORS
IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS CHOSEN MIGHT HE HAVE HAD A CHOICE
MOORE LIKEWISE KNEW HIS DANGER
THE RESULT WAS AN UNQUENCHABLE SCORN OF
THE QUARTER WHENCE SUCH DANGER WAS TO BE APPREHENDED
THE CONSCIOUSNESS
THAT HE HUNTED ASSASSINS WAS THE SPUR IN HIS HIGH METTLED TEMPER'S
FLANK
AS FOR FEAR HE WAS TOO PROUD TOO HARD NATURED IF YOU WILL
TOO PHLEGMATIC A MAN TO FEAR
MANY A TIME HE RODE BELATED OVER THE
MOORS MOONLIT OR MOONLESS AS THE CASE MIGHT BE WITH FEELINGS FAR MORE
ELATE FACULTIES FAR BETTER REFRESHED THAN WHEN SAFETY AND STAGNATION
ENVIRONED HIM IN THE COUNTING HOUSE
FOUR WAS THE NUMBER OF THE LEADERS
TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
TWO IN THE COURSE OF A FORTNIGHT WERE BROUGHT TO
BAY NEAR STILBRO' THE REMAINING TWO IT WAS NECESSARY TO SEEK FARTHER
OFF
THEIR HAUNTS WERE SUPPOSED TO LIE NEAR BIRMINGHAM
MEANTIME THE CLOTHIER DID NOT NEGLECT HIS BATTERED MILL
ITS REPARATION
WAS ESTEEMED A LIGHT TASK CARPENTERS' AND GLAZIERS' WORK ALONE BEING
NEEDED
THE RIOTERS NOT HAVING SUCCEEDED IN EFFECTING AN ENTRANCE HIS
GRIM METAL DARLINGS THE MACHINES HAD ESCAPED DAMAGE
WHETHER DURING THIS BUSY LIFE WHETHER WHILE STERN JUSTICE AND EXACTING
BUSINESS CLAIMED HIS ENERGIES AND HARASSED HIS THOUGHTS HE NOW AND THEN
GAVE ONE MOMENT DEDICATED ONE EFFORT TO KEEP ALIVE GENTLER FIRES THAN
THOSE WHICH SMOULDER IN THE FANE OF NEMESIS IT WAS NOT EASY TO
DISCOVER
HE SELDOM WENT NEAR FIELDHEAD IF HE DID HIS VISITS WERE
BRIEF
IF HE CALLED AT THE RECTORY IT WAS ONLY TO HOLD CONFERENCES WITH
THE RECTOR IN HIS STUDY
HE MAINTAINED HIS RIGID COURSE VERY STEADILY
MEANTIME THE HISTORY OF THE YEAR CONTINUED TROUBLED
THERE WAS NO LULL
IN THE TEMPEST OF WAR HER LONG HURRICANE STILL SWEPT THE CONTINENT
THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST SIGN OF SERENE WEATHER NO OPENING AMID THE
CLOUDS OF BATTLE DUST AND SMOKE NO FALL OF PURE DEWS GENIAL TO THE
OLIVE NO CESSATION OF THE RED RAIN WHICH NOURISHES THE BALEFUL AND
GLORIOUS LAUREL
MEANTIME RUIN HAD HER SAPPERS AND MINERS AT WORK UNDER
MOORE'S FEET AND WHETHER HE RODE OR WALKED WHETHER HE ONLY CROSSED HIS
COUNTING HOUSE HEARTH OR GALLOPED OVER SULLEN RUSHEDGE HE WAS AWARE OF
A HOLLOW ECHO AND FELT THE GROUND SHAKE TO HIS TREAD
WHILE THE SUMMER THUS PASSED WITH MOORE HOW DID IT LAPSE WITH SHIRLEY
AND CAROLINE LET US FIRST VISIT THE HEIRESS
HOW DOES SHE LOOK LIKE A
LOVE LORN MAIDEN PALE AND PINING FOR A NEGLECTFUL SWAIN DOES SHE SIT
THE DAY LONG BENT OVER SOME SEDENTARY TASK HAS SHE FOR EVER A BOOK IN
HER HAND OR SEWING ON HER KNEE AND EYES ONLY FOR THAT AND WORDS FOR
NOTHING AND THOUGHTS UNSPOKEN
BY NO MEANS
SHIRLEY IS ALL RIGHT
IF HER WISTFUL CAST OF PHYSIOGNOMY IS
NOT GONE NO MORE IS HER CARELESS SMILE
SHE KEEPS HER DARK OLD
MANOR HOUSE LIGHT AND BRIGHT WITH HER CHEERY PRESENCE
THE GALLERY AND
THE LOW CEILED CHAMBERS THAT OPEN INTO IT HAVE LEARNED LIVELY ECHOES
FROM HER VOICE THE DIM ENTRANCE HALL WITH ITS ONE WINDOW HAS GROWN
PLEASANTLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE FREQUENT RUSTLE OF A SILK DRESS AS ITS
WEARER SWEEPS ACROSS FROM ROOM TO ROOM NOW CARRYING FLOWERS TO THE
BARBAROUS PEACH BLOOM SALON NOW ENTERING THE DINING ROOM TO OPEN ITS
CASEMENTS AND LET IN THE SCENT OF MIGNONETTE AND SWEET BRIAR ANON
BRINGING PLANTS FROM THE STAIRCASE WINDOW TO PLACE IN THE SUN AT THE
OPEN PORCH DOOR
SHE TAKES HER SEWING OCCASIONALLY BUT BY SOME FATALITY SHE IS DOOMED
NEVER TO SIT STEADILY AT IT FOR ABOVE FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME
HER
THIMBLE IS SCARCELY FITTED ON HER NEEDLE SCARCE THREADED WHEN A SUDDEN
THOUGHT CALLS HER UPSTAIRS
PERHAPS SHE GOES TO SEEK SOME
JUST THEN REMEMBERED OLD IVORY BACKED NEEDLE BOOK OR OLDER CHINA TOPPED
WORK BOX QUITE UNNEEDED BUT WHICH SEEMS AT THE MOMENT INDISPENSABLE
PERHAPS TO ARRANGE HER HAIR OR A DRAWER WHICH SHE RECOLLECTS TO HAVE
SEEN THAT MORNING IN A STATE OF CURIOUS CONFUSION PERHAPS ONLY TO TAKE
A PEEP FROM A PARTICULAR WINDOW AT A PARTICULAR VIEW WHENCE BRIARFIELD
CHURCH AND RECTORY ARE VISIBLE PLEASANTLY BOWERED IN TREES
SHE HAS
SCARCELY RETURNED AND AGAIN TAKEN UP THE SLIP OF CAMBRIC OR SQUARE OF
HALF WROUGHT CANVAS WHEN TARTAR'S BOLD SCRAPE AND STRANGLED WHISTLE ARE
HEARD AT THE PORCH DOOR AND SHE MUST RUN TO OPEN IT FOR HIM
IT IS A
HOT DAY HE COMES IN PANTING SHE MUST CONVOY HIM TO THE KITCHEN AND
SEE WITH HER OWN EYES THAT HIS WATER BOWL IS REPLENISHED
THROUGH THE
OPEN KITCHEN DOOR THE COURT IS VISIBLE ALL SUNNY AND GAY AND PEOPLE
WITH TURKEYS AND THEIR POULTS PEAHENS AND THEIR CHICKS PEARL FLECKED
GUINEA FOWLS AND A BRIGHT VARIETY OF PURE WHITE AND PURPLE NECKED AND
BLUE AND CINNAMON PLUMED PIGEONS
IRRESISTIBLE SPECTACLE TO SHIRLEY SHE
RUNS TO THE PANTRY FOR A ROLL AND SHE STANDS ON THE DOOR STEP
SCATTERING CRUMBS
AROUND HER THRONG HER EAGER PLUMP HAPPY FEATHERED
VASSALS JOHN IS ABOUT THE STABLES AND JOHN MUST BE TALKED TO AND HER
MARE LOOKED AT
SHE IS STILL PETTING AND PATTING IT WHEN THE COWS COME
IN TO BE MILKED
THIS IS IMPORTANT SHIRLEY MUST STAY AND TAKE A REVIEW
OF THEM ALL
THERE ARE PERHAPS SOME LITTLE CALVES SOME LITTLE
NEW YEANED LAMBS IT MAY BE TWINS WHOSE MOTHERS HAVE REJECTED THEM
MISS KEELDAR MUST BE INTRODUCED TO THEM BY JOHN MUST PERMIT HERSELF THE
TREAT OF FEEDING THEM WITH HER OWN HAND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF HER
CAREFUL FOREMAN
MEANTIME JOHN MOOTS DOUBTFUL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
FARMING OF CERTAIN CROFTS AND INGS AND HOLMES AND HIS MISTRESS
IS NECESSITATED TO FETCH HER GARDEN HAT A GIPSY STRAW AND ACCOMPANY
HIM OVER STILE AND ALONG HEDGEROW TO HEAR THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE
AGRICULTURAL MATTER ON THE SPOT AND WITH THE SAID CROFTS INGS AND
HOLMS UNDER HER EYE
BRIGHT AFTERNOON THUS WEARS INTO SOFT EVENING
AND SHE COMES HOME TO A LATE TEA AND AFTER TEA SHE NEVER SEWS
AFTER TEA SHIRLEY READS AND SHE IS JUST ABOUT AS TENACIOUS OF HER BOOK
AS SHE IS LAX OF HER NEEDLE
HER STUDY IS THE RUG HER SEAT A FOOTSTOOL
OR PERHAPS ONLY THE CARPET AT MRS
PRYOR'S FEET THERE SHE ALWAYS
LEARNED HER LESSONS WHEN A CHILD AND OLD HABITS HAVE A STRONG POWER
OVER HER
THE TAWNY AND LIONLIKE BULK OF TARTAR IS EVER STRETCHED BESIDE
HER HIS NEGRO MUZZLE LAID ON HIS FORE PAWS STRAIGHT STRONG AND
SHAPELY AS THE LIMBS OF AN ALPINE WOLF
ONE HAND OF THE MISTRESS
GENERALLY REPOSES ON THE LOVING SERF'S RUDE HEAD BECAUSE IF SHE TAKES
IT AWAY HE GROANS AND IS DISCONTENTED
SHIRLEY'S MIND IS GIVEN TO HER
BOOK
SHE LIFTS NOT HER EYES SHE NEITHER STIRS NOR SPEAKS UNLESS
INDEED IT BE TO RETURN A BRIEF RESPECTFUL ANSWER TO MRS
PRYOR WHO
ADDRESSES DEPRECATORY PHRASES TO HER NOW AND THEN
MY DEAR YOU HAD BETTER NOT HAVE THAT GREAT DOG SO NEAR YOU HE IS
CRUSHING THE BORDER OF YOUR DRESS
OH IT IS ONLY MUSLIN
I CAN PUT A CLEAN ONE ON TO MORROW
MY DEAR I WISH YOU COULD ACQUIRE THE HABIT OF SITTING TO A TABLE WHEN
YOU READ
I WILL TRY MA'AM SOME TIME BUT IT IS SO COMFORTABLE TO DO AS ONE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DO
MY DEAR LET ME BEG OF YOU TO PUT THAT BOOK DOWN
YOU ARE TRYING YOUR
EYES BY THE DOUBTFUL FIRELIGHT
NO MA'AM NOT AT ALL MY EYES ARE NEVER TIRED
AT LAST HOWEVER A PALE LIGHT FALLS ON THE PAGE FROM THE WINDOW
SHE
LOOKS THE MOON IS UP
SHE CLOSES THE VOLUME RISES AND WALKS THROUGH
THE ROOM
HER BOOK HAS PERHAPS BEEN A GOOD ONE IT HAS REFRESHED
REFILLED REWARMED HER HEART IT HAS SET HER BRAIN ASTIR FURNISHED HER
MIND WITH PICTURES
THE STILL PARLOUR THE CLEAN HEARTH THE WINDOW
OPENING ON THE TWILIGHT SKY AND SHOWING ITS SWEET REGENT NEW THRONED
AND GLORIOUS SUFFICE TO MAKE EARTH AN EDEN LIFE A POEM FOR SHIRLEY
A
STILL DEEP INBORN DELIGHT GLOWS IN HER YOUNG VEINS UNMINGLED
UNTROUBLED NOT TO BE REACHED OR RAVISHED BY HUMAN AGENCY BECAUSE BY NO
HUMAN AGENCY BESTOWED THE PURE GIFT OF GOD TO HIS CREATURE THE FREE
DOWER OF NATURE TO HER CHILD
THIS JOY GIVES HER EXPERIENCE OF A
GENII LIFE
BUOYANT BY GREEN STEPS BY GLAD HILLS ALL VERDURE AND
LIGHT SHE REACHES A STATION SCARCELY LOWER THAN THAT WHENCE ANGELS
LOOKED DOWN ON THE DREAMER OF BETHEL AND HER EYE SEEKS AND HER SOUL
POSSESSES THE VISION OF LIFE AS SHE WISHES IT
NO NOT AS SHE WISHES
IT SHE HAS NOT TIME TO WISH
THE SWIFT GLORY SPREADS OUT SWEEPING AND
KINDLING AND MULTIPLIES ITS SPLENDOURS FASTER THAN THOUGHT CAN EFFECT
HIS COMBINATIONS FASTER THAN ASPIRATION CAN UTTER HER LONGINGS
SHIRLEY
SAYS NOTHING WHILE THE TRANCE IS UPON HER SHE IS QUITE MUTE BUT IF
MRS
PRYOR SPEAKS TO HER NOW SHE GOES OUT QUIETLY AND CONTINUES HER
WALK UPSTAIRS IN THE DIM GALLERY
IF SHIRLEY WERE NOT AN INDOLENT A RECKLESS AN IGNORANT BEING SHE
WOULD TAKE A PEN AT SUCH MOMENTS OR AT LEAST WHILE THE RECOLLECTION OF
SUCH MOMENTS WAS YET FRESH ON HER SPIRIT
SHE WOULD SEIZE SHE WOULD FIX
THE APPARITION TELL THE VISION REVEALED
HAD SHE A LITTLE MORE OF THE
ORGAN OF ACQUISITIVENESS IN HER HEAD A LITTLE MORE OF THE LOVE OF
PROPERTY IN HER NATURE SHE WOULD TAKE A GOOD SIZED SHEET OF PAPER AND
WRITE PLAINLY OUT IN HER OWN QUEER BUT CLEAR AND LEGIBLE HAND THE
STORY THAT HAS BEEN NARRATED THE SONG THAT HAS BEEN SUNG TO HER AND
THUS POSSESS WHAT SHE WAS ENABLED TO CREATE
BUT INDOLENT SHE IS
RECKLESS SHE IS AND MOST IGNORANT FOR SHE DOES NOT KNOW HER DREAMS ARE
RARE HER FEELINGS PECULIAR
SHE DOES NOT KNOW HAS NEVER KNOWN AND
WILL DIE WITHOUT KNOWING THE FULL VALUE OF THAT SPRING WHOSE BRIGHT
FRESH BUBBLING IN HER HEART KEEPS IT GREEN
SHIRLEY TAKES LIFE EASILY
IS NOT THAT FACT WRITTEN IN HER EYE IN HER
GOOD TEMPERED MOMENTS IS IT NOT AS FULL OF LAZY SOFTNESS AS IN HER BRIEF
FITS OF ANGER IT IS FULGENT WITH QUICK FLASHING FIRE HER NATURE IS IN
HER EYE
SO LONG AS SHE IS CALM INDOLENCE INDULGENCE HUMOUR AND
TENDERNESS POSSESS THAT LARGE GRAY SPHERE INCENSE HER A RED RAY
PIERCES THE DEW IT QUICKENS INSTANTLY TO FLAME
ERE THE MONTH OF JULY WAS PAST MISS KEELDAR WOULD PROBABLY HAVE STARTED
WITH CAROLINE ON THAT NORTHERN TOUR THEY HAD PLANNED BUT JUST AT THAT
EPOCH AN INVASION BEFELL FIELDHEAD
A GENTEEL FORAGING PARTY BESIEGED
SHIRLEY IN HER CASTLE AND COMPELLED HER TO SURRENDER AT DISCRETION
AN
UNCLE AN AUNT AND TWO COUSINS FROM THE SOUTH A MR MRS AND TWO
MISSES SYMPSON OF SYMPSON GROVE SHIRE CAME DOWN UPON HER IN
STATE
THE LAWS OF HOSPITALITY OBLIGED HER TO GIVE IN WHICH SHE DID
WITH A FACILITY WHICH SOMEWHAT SURPRISED CAROLINE WHO KNEW HER TO BE
PROMPT IN ACTION AND FERTILE IN EXPEDIENT WHERE A VICTORY WAS TO BE
GAINED FOR HER WILL
MISS HELSTONE EVEN ASKED HER HOW IT WAS SHE
SUBMITTED SO READILY
SHE ANSWERED OLD FEELINGS HAD THEIR POWER SHE
HAD PASSED TWO YEARS OF HER EARLY YOUTH AT SYMPSON GROVE
HOW DID SHE LIKE HER RELATIVES
SHE HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THEM SHE REPLIED
LITTLE HARRY SYMPSON
INDEED THE SOLE SON OF THE FAMILY WAS VERY UNLIKE HIS SISTERS AND OF
HIM SHE HAD FORMERLY BEEN FOND BUT HE WAS NOT COMING TO YORKSHIRE AT
LEAST NOT YET
THE NEXT SUNDAY THE FIELDHEAD PEW IN BRIARFIELD CHURCH APPEARED PEOPLED
WITH A PRIM TRIM FIDGETY ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WHO SHIFTED HIS
SPECTACLES AND CHANGED HIS POSITION EVERY THREE MINUTES A PATIENT
PLACID LOOKING ELDERLY LADY IN BROWN SATIN AND TWO PATTERN YOUNG
LADIES IN PATTERN ATTIRE WITH PATTERN DEPORTMENT
SHIRLEY HAD THE AIR
OF A BLACK SWAN OR A WHITE CROW IN THE MIDST OF THIS PARTY AND VERY
FORLORN WAS HER ASPECT
HAVING BROUGHT HER INTO RESPECTABLE SOCIETY WE
WILL LEAVE HER THERE A WHILE AND LOOK AFTER MISS HELSTONE
SEPARATED FROM MISS KEELDAR FOR THE PRESENT AS SHE COULD NOT SEEK HER
IN THE MIDST OF HER FINE RELATIVES SCARED AWAY FROM FIELDHEAD BY THE
VISITING COMMOTION WHICH THE NEW ARRIVALS OCCASIONED IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD CAROLINE WAS LIMITED ONCE MORE TO THE GRAY RECTORY THE
SOLITARY MORNING WALK IN REMOTE BY PATHS THE LONG LONELY AFTERNOON
SITTING IN A QUIET PARLOUR WHICH THE SUN FORSOOK AT NOON OR IN THE
GARDEN ALCOVE WHERE IT SHONE BRIGHT YET SAD ON THE RIPENING RED
CURRANTS TRAINED OVER THE TRELLIS AND ON THE FAIR MONTHLY ROSES
ENTWINED BETWEEN AND THROUGH THEM FELL CHEQUERED ON CAROLINE SITTING IN
HER WHITE SUMMER DRESS STILL AS A GARDEN STATUE
THERE SHE READ OLD
BOOKS TAKEN FROM HER UNCLE'S LIBRARY
THE GREEK AND LATIN WERE OF NO
USE TO HER AND ITS COLLECTION OF LIGHT LITERATURE WAS CHIEFLY CONTAINED
ON A SHELF WHICH HAD BELONGED TO HER AUNT MARY SOME VENERABLE LADY'S
MAGAZINES THAT HAD ONCE PERFORMED A SEA VOYAGE WITH THEIR OWNER AND
UNDERGONE A STORM AND WHOSE PAGES WERE STAINED WITH SALT WATER SOME
MAD METHODIST MAGAZINES FULL OF MIRACLES AND APPARITIONS OF
PRETERNATURAL WARNINGS OMINOUS DREAMS AND FRENZIED FANATICISM THE
EQUALLY MAD LETTERS OF MRS
ELIZABETH ROWE FROM THE DEAD TO THE LIVING
A FEW OLD ENGLISH CLASSICS
FROM THESE FADED FLOWERS CAROLINE HAD IN HER
CHILDHOOD EXTRACTED THE HONEY THEY WERE TASTELESS TO HER NOW
BY WAY OF
CHANGE AND ALSO OF DOING GOOD SHE WOULD SEW MAKE GARMENTS FOR THE
POOR ACCORDING TO GOOD MISS AINLEY'S DIRECTION
SOMETIMES AS SHE FELT
AND SAW HER TEARS FALL SLOWLY ON HER WORK SHE WOULD WONDER HOW THE
EXCELLENT WOMAN WHO HAD CUT IT OUT AND ARRANGED IT FOR HER MANAGED TO BE
SO EQUABLY SERENE IN HER SOLITUDE
I NEVER FIND MISS AINLEY OPPRESSED WITH DESPONDENCY OR LOST IN GRIEF
SHE THOUGHT YET HER COTTAGE IS A STILL DIM LITTLE PLACE AND SHE IS
WITHOUT A BRIGHT HOPE OR NEAR FRIEND IN THE WORLD
I REMEMBER THOUGH
SHE TOLD ME ONCE SHE HAD TUTORED HER THOUGHTS TO TEND UPWARDS TO HEAVEN
SHE ALLOWED THERE WAS AND EVER HAD BEEN LITTLE ENJOYMENT IN THIS WORLD
FOR HER AND SHE LOOKS I SUPPOSE TO THE BLISS OF THE WORLD TO COME
SO
DO NUNS WITH THEIR CLOSE CELL THEIR IRON LAMP THEIR ROBE STRAIT AS A
SHROUD THEIR BED NARROW AS A COFFIN
SHE SAYS OFTEN SHE HAS NO FEAR OF
DEATH NO DREAD OF THE GRAVE NO MORE DOUBTLESS HAD ST
SIMEON
STYLITES LIFTED UP TERRIBLE ON HIS WILD COLUMN IN THE WILDERNESS NO
MORE HAS THE HINDU VOTARY STRETCHED ON HIS COUCH OF IRON SPIKES
BOTH
THESE HAVING VIOLATED NATURE THEIR NATURAL LIKINGS AND ANTIPATHIES ARE
REVERSED THEY GROW ALTOGETHER MORBID
I DO FEAR DEATH AS YET BUT I
BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE I AM YOUNG
POOR MISS AINLEY WOULD CLING CLOSER TO
LIFE IF LIFE HAD MORE CHARMS FOR HER
GOD SURELY DID NOT CREATE US AND
CAUSE US TO LIVE WITH THE SOLE END OF WISHING ALWAYS TO DIE
I BELIEVE
IN MY HEART WE WERE INTENDED TO PRIZE LIFE AND ENJOY IT SO LONG AS WE
RETAIN IT
EXISTENCE NEVER WAS ORIGINALLY MEANT TO BE THAT USELESS
BLANK PALE SLOW TRAILING THING IT OFTEN BECOMES TO MANY AND IS
BECOMING TO ME AMONG THE REST
NOBODY SHE WENT ON NOBODY IN PARTICULAR IS TO BLAME THAT I CAN
SEE FOR THE STATE IN WHICH THINGS ARE AND I CANNOT TELL HOWEVER MUCH
I PUZZLE OVER IT HOW THEY ARE TO BE ALTERED FOR THE BETTER BUT I FEEL
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG SOMEWHERE
I BELIEVE SINGLE WOMEN SHOULD HAVE
MORE TO DO BETTER CHANCES OF INTERESTING AND PROFITABLE OCCUPATION THAN
THEY POSSESS NOW
AND WHEN I SPEAK THUS I HAVE NO IMPRESSION THAT I
DISPLEASE GOD BY MY WORDS THAT I AM EITHER IMPIOUS OR IMPATIENT
IRRELIGIOUS OR SACRILEGIOUS
MY CONSOLATION IS INDEED THAT GOD HEARS
MANY A GROAN AND COMPASSIONATES MUCH GRIEF WHICH MAN STOPS HIS EARS
AGAINST OR FROWNS ON WITH IMPOTENT CONTEMPT
I SAY IMPOTENT FOR I
OBSERVE THAT TO SUCH GRIEVANCES AS SOCIETY CANNOT READILY CURE IT
USUALLY FORBIDS UTTERANCE ON PAIN OF ITS SCORN THIS SCORN BEING ONLY A
SORT OF TINSELLED CLOAK TO ITS DEFORMED WEAKNESS
PEOPLE HATE TO BE
REMINDED OF ILLS THEY ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO REMEDY
SUCH REMINDER
IN FORCING ON THEM A SENSE OF THEIR OWN INCAPACITY OR A MORE PAINFUL
SENSE OF AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SOME UNPLEASANT EFFORT TROUBLES THEIR
EASE AND SHAKES THEIR SELF COMPLACENCY
OLD MAIDS LIKE THE HOUSELESS
AND UNEMPLOYED POOR SHOULD NOT ASK FOR A PLACE AND AN OCCUPATION IN THE
WORLD THE DEMAND DISTURBS THE HAPPY AND RICH IT DISTURBS PARENTS
LOOK
AT THE NUMEROUS FAMILIES OF GIRLS IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THE ARMITAGES
THE BIRTWHISTLES THE SYKESES
THE BROTHERS OF THESE GIRLS ARE EVERY ONE
IN BUSINESS OR IN PROFESSIONS THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
THEIR SISTERS
HAVE NO EARTHLY EMPLOYMENT BUT HOUSEHOLD WORK AND SEWING NO EARTHLY
PLEASURE BUT AN UNPROFITABLE VISITING AND NO HOPE IN ALL THEIR LIFE TO
COME OF ANYTHING BETTER
THIS STAGNANT STATE OF THINGS MAKES THEM
DECLINE IN HEALTH
THEY ARE NEVER WELL AND THEIR MINDS AND VIEWS SHRINK
TO WONDROUS NARROWNESS
THE GREAT WISH THE SOLE AIM OF EVERY ONE OF
THEM IS TO BE MARRIED BUT THE MAJORITY WILL NEVER MARRY THEY WILL DIE
AS THEY NOW LIVE
THEY SCHEME THEY PLOT THEY DRESS TO ENSNARE
HUSBANDS
THE GENTLEMEN TURN THEM INTO RIDICULE THEY DON'T WANT THEM
THEY HOLD THEM VERY CHEAP
THEY SAY I HAVE HEARD THEM SAY IT WITH
SNEERING LAUGHS MANY A TIME THE MATRIMONIAL MARKET IS OVERSTOCKED
FATHERS SAY SO LIKEWISE AND ARE ANGRY WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS WHEN THEY
OBSERVE THEIR MANUVRES THEY ORDER THEM TO STAY AT HOME
WHAT DO THEY
EXPECT THEM TO DO AT HOME IF YOU ASK THEY WOULD ANSWER SEW AND COOK
THEY EXPECT THEM TO DO THIS AND THIS ONLY CONTENTEDLY REGULARLY
UNCOMPLAININGLY ALL THEIR LIVES LONG AS IF THEY HAD NO GERMS OF
FACULTIES FOR ANYTHING ELSE A DOCTRINE AS REASONABLE TO HOLD AS IT
WOULD BE THAT THE FATHERS HAVE NO FACULTIES BUT FOR EATING WHAT THEIR
DAUGHTERS COOK OR FOR WEARING WHAT THEY SEW
COULD MEN LIVE SO
THEMSELVES WOULD THEY NOT BE VERY WEARY AND WHEN THERE CAME NO RELIEF
TO THEIR WEARINESS BUT ONLY REPROACHES AT ITS SLIGHTEST MANIFESTATION
WOULD NOT THEIR WEARINESS FERMENT IT TIME TO FRENZY LUCRETIA SPINNING
AT MIDNIGHT IN THE MIDST OF HER MAIDENS AND SOLOMON'S VIRTUOUS WOMAN
ARE OFTEN QUOTED AS PATTERNS OF WHAT 'THE SEX AS THEY SAY OUGHT TO
BE
I DON'T KNOW
LUCRETIA I DARE SAY WAS A MOST WORTHY SORT OF
PERSON MUCH LIKE MY COUSIN HORTENSE MOORE BUT SHE KEPT HER SERVANTS UP
VERY LATE
I SHOULD NOT HAVE LIKED TO BE AMONGST THE NUMBER OF THE
MAIDENS
HORTENSE WOULD JUST WORK ME AND SARAH IN THAT FASHION IF SHE
COULD AND NEITHER OF US WOULD BEAR IT
THE 'VIRTUOUS WOMAN AGAIN HAD
HER HOUSEHOLD UP IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SHE 'GOT BREAKFAST
OVER AS MRS
SYKES SAYS BEFORE ONE O'CLOCK A M BUT SHE HAD
SOMETHING MORE TO DO THAN SPIN AND GIVE OUT PORTIONS
SHE WAS A
MANUFACTURER SHE MADE FINE LINEN AND SOLD IT SHE WAS AN
AGRICULTURIST SHE BOUGHT ESTATES AND PLANTED VINEYARDS
THAT WOMAN
WAS A MANAGER
SHE WAS WHAT THE MATRONS HEREABOUTS CALL 'A CLEVER
WOMAN ON THE WHOLE I LIKE HER A GOOD DEAL BETTER THAN LUCRETIA BUT I
DON'T BELIEVE EITHER MR
ARMITAGE OR MR
SYKES COULD HAVE GOT THE
ADVANTAGE OF HER IN A BARGAIN
YET I LIKE HER
'STRENGTH AND HONOUR WERE
HER CLOTHING THE HEART OF HER HUSBAND SAFELY TRUSTED IN HER
SHE OPENED
HER MOUTH WITH WISDOM IN HER TONGUE WAS THE LAW OF KINDNESS HER
CHILDREN ROSE UP AND CALLED HER BLESSED HER HUSBAND ALSO PRAISED HER
KING OF ISRAEL YOUR MODEL OF A WOMAN IS A WORTHY MODEL BUT ARE WE IN
THESE DAYS BROUGHT UP TO BE LIKE HER MEN OF YORKSHIRE DO YOUR
DAUGHTERS REACH THIS ROYAL STANDARD CAN THEY REACH IT CAN YOU HELP
THEM TO REACH IT CAN YOU GIVE THEM A FIELD IN WHICH THEIR FACULTIES MAY
BE EXERCISED AND GROW MEN OF ENGLAND LOOK AT YOUR POOR GIRLS MANY OF
THEM FADING AROUND YOU DROPPING OFF IN CONSUMPTION OR DECLINE OR WHAT
IS WORSE DEGENERATING TO SOUR OLD MAIDS ENVIOUS BACK BITING
WRETCHED BECAUSE LIFE IS A DESERT TO THEM OR WHAT IS WORST OF ALL
REDUCED TO STRIVE BY SCARCE MODEST COQUETRY AND DEBASING ARTIFICE TO
GAIN THAT POSITION AND CONSIDERATION BY MARRIAGE WHICH TO CELIBACY IS
DENIED
FATHERS CANNOT YOU ALTER THESE THINGS PERHAPS NOT ALL AT ONCE
BUT CONSIDER THE MATTER WELL WHEN IT IS BROUGHT BEFORE YOU RECEIVE IT
AS A THEME WORTHY OF THOUGHT DO NOT DISMISS IT WITH AN IDLE JEST OR AN
UNMANLY INSULT
YOU WOULD WISH TO BE PROUD OF YOUR DAUGHTERS AND NOT TO
BLUSH FOR THEM THEN SEEK FOR THEM AN INTEREST AND AN OCCUPATION WHICH
SHALL RAISE THEM ABOVE THE FLIRT THE MANUVRER THE MISCHIEF MAKING
TALE BEARER
KEEP YOUR GIRLS' MINDS NARROW AND FETTERED THEY WILL STILL
BE A PLAGUE AND A CARE SOMETIMES A DISGRACE TO YOU
CULTIVATE
THEM GIVE THEM SCOPE AND WORK THEY WILL BE YOUR GAYEST COMPANIONS IN
HEALTH YOUR TENDEREST NURSES IN SICKNESS YOUR MOST FAITHFUL PROP IN
AGE
CHAPTER XXIII
AN EVENING OUT
ONE FINE SUMMER DAY THAT CAROLINE HAD SPENT ENTIRELY ALONE HER UNCLE
BEING AT WHINBURY AND WHOSE LONG BRIGHT NOISELESS BREEZELESS
CLOUDLESS HOURS HOW MANY THEY SEEMED SINCE SUNRISE HAD BEEN TO HER AS
DESOLATE AS IF THEY HAD GONE OVER HER HEAD IN THE SHADOWLESS AND
TRACKLESS WASTES OF SAHARA INSTEAD OF IN THE BLOOMING GARDEN OF AN
ENGLISH HOME SHE WAS SITTING IN THE ALCOVE HER TASK OF WORK ON HER
KNEE HER FINGERS ASSIDUOUSLY PLYING THE NEEDLE HER EYES FOLLOWING AND
REGULATING THEIR MOVEMENTS HER BRAIN WORKING RESTLESSLY WHEN FANNY
CAME TO THE DOOR LOOKED ROUND OVER THE LAWN AND BORDERS AND NOT SEEING
HER WHOM SHE SOUGHT CALLED OUT MISS CAROLINE
A LOW VOICE ANSWERED FANNY IT ISSUED FROM THE ALCOVE AND THITHER
FANNY HASTENED A NOTE IN HER HAND WHICH SHE DELIVERED TO FINGERS THAT
HARDLY SEEMED TO HAVE NERVE TO HOLD IT
MISS HELSTONE DID NOT ASK WHENCE
IT CAME AND SHE DID NOT LOOK AT IT SHE LET IT DROP AMONGST THE FOLDS
OF HER WORK
JOE SCOTT'S SON HARRY BROUGHT IT SAID FANNY
THE GIRL WAS NO ENCHANTRESS AND KNEW NO MAGIC SPELL YET WHAT SHE SAID
TOOK ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HER YOUNG MISTRESS
SHE LIFTED HER HEAD
WITH THE QUICK MOTION OF REVIVED SENSATION SHE SHOT NOT A LANGUID BUT
A LIFELIKE QUESTIONING GLANCE AT FANNY
HARRY SCOTT WHO SENT HIM
HE CAME FROM THE HOLLOW
THE DROPPED NOTE WAS SNATCHED UP EAGERLY THE SEAL WAS BROKEN IT WAS
READ IN TWO SECONDS
AN AFFECTIONATE BILLET FROM HORTENSE INFORMING HER
YOUNG COUSIN THAT SHE WAS RETURNED FROM WORMWOOD WELLS THAT SHE WAS
ALONE TO DAY AS ROBERT WAS GONE TO WHINBURY MARKET THAT NOTHING WOULD
GIVE HER GREATER PLEASURE THAN TO HAVE CAROLINE'S COMPANY TO TEA AND
THE GOOD LADY ADDED SHE WAS QUITE SURE SUCH A CHANGE WOULD BE MOST
ACCEPTABLE AND BENEFICIAL TO CAROLINE WHO MUST BE SADLY AT A LOSS BOTH
FOR SAFE GUIDANCE AND IMPROVING SOCIETY SINCE THE MISUNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN ROBERT AND MR
HELSTONE HAD OCCASIONED A SEPARATION FROM HER
MEILLEURE AMIE HORTENSE GRARD MOORE IN A POSTSCRIPT SHE WAS URGED
TO PUT ON HER BONNET AND RUN DOWN DIRECTLY
CAROLINE DID NOT NEED THE INJUNCTION
GLAD WAS SHE TO LAY BY THE BROWN
HOLLAND CHILD'S SLIP SHE WAS TRIMMING WITH BRAID FOR THE JEW'S BASKET
TO HASTEN UPSTAIRS COVER HER CURLS WITH HER STRAW BONNET AND THROW
ROUND HER SHOULDERS THE BLACK SILK SCARF WHOSE SIMPLE DRAPERY SUITED AS
WELL HER SHAPE AS ITS DARK HUE SET OFF THE PURITY OF HER DRESS AND THE
FAIRNESS OF HER FACE GLAD WAS SHE TO ESCAPE FOR A FEW HOURS THE
SOLITUDE THE SADNESS THE NIGHTMARE OF HER LIFE GLAD TO RUN DOWN THE
GREEN LANE SLOPING TO THE HOLLOW TO SCENT THE FRAGRANCE OF HEDGE
FLOWERS SWEETER THAN THE PERFUME OF MOSS ROSE OR LILY
TRUE SHE KNEW
ROBERT WAS NOT AT THE COTTAGE BUT IT WAS DELIGHT TO GO WHERE HE HAD
LATELY BEEN
SO LONG SO TOTALLY SEPARATED FROM HIM MERELY TO SEE HIS
HOME TO ENTER THE ROOM WHERE HE HAD THAT MORNING SAT FELT LIKE A
REUNION
AS SUCH IT REVIVED HER AND THEN ILLUSION WAS AGAIN FOLLOWING
HER IN PERI MASK
THE SOFT AGITATION OF WINGS CARESSED HER CHEEK AND
THE AIR BREATHING FROM THE BLUE SUMMER SKY BORE A VOICE WHICH
WHISPERED ROBERT MAY COME HOME WHILE YOU ARE IN HIS HOUSE AND THEN
AT LEAST YOU MAY LOOK IN HIS FACE AT LEAST YOU MAY GIVE HIM YOUR HAND
PERHAPS FOR A MINUTE YOU MAY SIT BESIDE HIM
SILENCE WAS HER AUSTERE RESPONSE BUT SHE LOVED THE COMFORTER AND THE
CONSOLATION
MISS MOORE PROBABLY CAUGHT FROM THE WINDOW THE GLEAM AND FLUTTER OF
CAROLINE'S WHITE ATTIRE THROUGH THE BRANCHY GARDEN SHRUBS FOR SHE
ADVANCED FROM THE COTTAGE PORCH TO MEET HER
STRAIGHT UNBENDING
PHLEGMATIC AS USUAL SHE CAME ON
NO HASTE OR ECSTASY WAS EVER PERMITTED
TO DISORDER THE DIGNITY OF HER MOVEMENTS BUT SHE SMILED WELL PLEASED
TO MARK THE DELIGHT OF HER PUPIL TO FEEL HER KISS AND THE GENTLE
GENIAL STRAIN OF HER EMBRACE
SHE LED HER TENDERLY IN HALF DECEIVED AND
WHOLLY FLATTERED
HALF DECEIVED HAD IT NOT BEEN SO SHE WOULD IN ALL
PROBABILITY HAVE PUT HER TO THE WICKET AND SHUT HER OUT
HAD SHE KNOWN
CLEARLY TO WHOSE ACCOUNT THE CHIEF SHARE OF THIS CHILDLIKE JOY WAS TO BE
PLACED HORTENSE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE FELT BOTH SHOCKED AND INCENSED
SISTERS DO NOT LIKE YOUNG LADIES TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THEIR BROTHERS
IT SEEMS IF NOT PRESUMPTUOUS SILLY WEAK A DELUSION AN ABSURD
MISTAKE
THEY DO NOT LOVE THESE GENTLEMEN WHATEVER SISTERLY AFFECTION
THEY MAY CHERISH TOWARDS THEM AND THAT OTHERS SHOULD REPELS THEM WITH
A SENSE OF CRUDE ROMANCE
THE FIRST MOVEMENT IN SHORT EXCITED BY SUCH
DISCOVERY AS WITH MANY PARENTS ON FINDING THEIR CHILDREN TO BE IN LOVE
IS ONE OF MIXED IMPATIENCE AND CONTEMPT
REASON IF THEY BE RATIONAL
PEOPLE CORRECTS THE FALSE FEELING IN TIME BUT IF THEY BE IRRATIONAL
IT IS NEVER CORRECTED AND THE DAUGHTER OR SISTER IN LAW IS DISLIKED TO
THE END
YOU WOULD EXPECT TO FIND ME ALONE FROM WHAT I SAID IN MY NOTE
OBSERVED MISS MOORE AS SHE CONDUCTED CAROLINE TOWARDS THE PARLOUR BUT
IT WAS WRITTEN THIS MORNING SINCE DINNER COMPANY HAS COME IN
AND OPENING THE DOOR SHE MADE VISIBLE AN AMPLE SPREAD OF CRIMSON SKIRTS
OVERFLOWING THE ELBOW CHAIR AT THE FIRESIDE AND ABOVE THEM PRESIDING
WITH DIGNITY A CAP MORE AWFUL THAN A CROWN
THAT CAP HAD NEVER COME TO
THE COTTAGE UNDER A BONNET NO IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN A VAST BAG OR
RATHER A MIDDLE SIZED BALLOON OF BLACK SILK HELD WIDE WITH WHALEBONE
THE SCREED OR FRILL OF THE CAP STOOD A QUARTER OF A YARD BROAD ROUND
THE FACE OF THE WEARER
THE RIBBON FLOURISHING IN PUFFS AND BOWS ABOUT
THE HEAD WAS OF THE SORT CALLED LOVE RIBBON
THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF
IT I MAY SAY A VERY GREAT DEAL
MRS
YORKE WORE THE CAP IT BECAME
HER SHE WORE THE GOWN ALSO IT SUITED HER NO LESS
THAT GREAT LADY WAS COME IN A FRIENDLY WAY TO TAKE TEA WITH MISS MOORE
IT WAS ALMOST AS GREAT AND AS RARE A FAVOUR AS IF THE QUEEN WERE TO GO
UNINVITED TO SHARE POT LUCK WITH ONE OF HER SUBJECTS
A HIGHER MARK OF
DISTINCTION SHE COULD NOT SHOW SHE WHO IN GENERAL SCORNED VISITING AND
TEA DRINKING AND HELD CHEAP AND STIGMATIZED AS GOSSIPS EVERY MAID AND
MATRON OF THE VICINAGE
THERE WAS NO MISTAKE HOWEVER MISS MOORE WAS A FAVOURITE WITH HER
SHE HAD EVINCED THE FACT MORE THAN ONCE EVINCED IT BY STOPPING TO SPEAK
TO HER IN THE CHURCHYARD ON SUNDAYS BY INVITING HER ALMOST HOSPITABLY
TO COME TO BRIARMAINS EVINCED IT TO DAY BY THE GRAND CONDESCENSION OF A
PERSONAL VISIT
HER REASONS FOR THE PREFERENCE AS ASSIGNED BY HERSELF
WERE THAT MISS MOORE WAS A WOMAN OF STEADY DEPORTMENT WITHOUT THE LEAST
LEVITY OF CONVERSATION OR CARRIAGE ALSO THAT BEING A FOREIGNER SHE
MUST FEEL THE WANT OF A FRIEND TO COUNTENANCE HER
SHE MIGHT HAVE ADDED
THAT HER PLAIN ASPECT HOMELY PRECISE DRESS AND PHLEGMATIC
UNATTRACTIVE MANNER WERE TO HER SO MANY ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
IT
IS CERTAIN AT LEAST THAT LADIES REMARKABLE FOR THE OPPOSITE QUALITIES
OF BEAUTY LIVELY BEARING AND ELEGANT TASTE IN ATTIRE WERE NOT OFTEN
FAVOURED WITH HER APPROBATION
WHATEVER GENTLEMEN ARE APT TO ADMIRE IN
WOMEN MRS
YORKE CONDEMNED AND WHAT THEY OVERLOOK OR DESPISE SHE
PATRONIZED
CAROLINE ADVANCED TO THE MIGHTY MATRON WITH SOME SENSE OF DIFFIDENCE
SHE KNEW LITTLE OF MRS
YORKE AND AS A PARSON'S NIECE WAS DOUBTFUL
WHAT SORT OF A RECEPTION SHE MIGHT GET
SHE GOT A VERY COOL ONE AND WAS
GLAD TO HIDE HER DISCOMFITURE BY TURNING AWAY TO TAKE OFF HER BONNET
NOR UPON SITTING DOWN WAS SHE DISPLEASED TO BE IMMEDIATELY ACCOSTED BY
A LITTLE PERSONAGE IN A BLUE FROCK AND SASH WHO STARTED UP LIKE SOME
FAIRY FROM THE SIDE OF THE GREAT DAME'S CHAIR WHERE SHE HAD BEEN
SITTING ON A FOOTSTOOL SCREENED FROM VIEW BY THE FOLDS OF THE WIDE RED
GOWN AND RUNNING TO MISS HELSTONE UNCEREMONIOUSLY THREW HER ARMS ROUND
HER NECK AND DEMANDED A KISS
MY MOTHER IS NOT CIVIL TO YOU SAID THE PETITIONER AS SHE RECEIVED
AND REPAID A SMILING SALUTE AND ROSE THERE TAKES NO NOTICE OF YOU IT
IS THEIR WAY
IF INSTEAD OF YOU A WHITE ANGEL WITH A CROWN OF STARS
HAD COME INTO THE ROOM MOTHER WOULD NOD STIFFLY AND ROSE NEVER LIFT
HER HEAD AT ALL BUT I WILL BE YOUR FRIEND I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED YOU
JESSIE CURB THAT TONGUE OF YOURS AND REPRESS YOUR FORWARDNESS SAID
MRS
YORKE
BUT MOTHER YOU ARE SO FROZEN EXPOSTULATED JESSIE
MISS HELSTONE
HAS NEVER DONE YOU ANY HARM WHY CAN'T YOU BE KIND TO HER YOU SIT SO
STIFF AND LOOK SO COLD AND SPEAK SO DRY WHAT FOR THAT'S JUST THE
FASHION IN WHICH YOU TREAT MISS SHIRLEY KEELDAR AND EVERY OTHER YOUNG
LADY WHO COMES TO OUR HOUSE
AND ROSE THERE IS SUCH AN AUT AUT I HAVE
FORGOTTEN THE WORD BUT IT MEANS A MACHINE IN THE SHAPE OF A HUMAN
BEING
HOWEVER BETWEEN YOU YOU WILL DRIVE EVERY SOUL AWAY FROM
BRIARMAINS MARTIN OFTEN SAYS SO
I AM AN AUTOMATON GOOD LET ME ALONE THEN SAID ROSE SPEAKING FROM
A CORNER WHERE SHE WAS SITTING ON THE CARPET AT THE FOOT OF A BOOKCASE
WITH A VOLUME SPREAD OPEN ON HER KNEE MISS HELSTONE HOW DO YOU DO
SHE ADDED DIRECTING A BRIEF GLANCE TO THE PERSON ADDRESSED AND THEN
AGAIN CASTING DOWN HER GRAY REMARKABLE EYES ON THE BOOK AND RETURNING
TO THE STUDY OF ITS PAGES
CAROLINE STOLE A QUIET GAZE TOWARDS HER DWELLING ON HER YOUNG ABSORBED
COUNTENANCE AND OBSERVING A CERTAIN UNCONSCIOUS MOVEMENT OF THE MOUTH
AS SHE READ A MOVEMENT FULL OF CHARACTER
CAROLINE HAD TACT AND SHE
HAD FINE INSTINCT
SHE FELT THAT ROSE YORKE WAS A PECULIAR CHILD ONE OF
THE UNIQUE SHE KNEW HOW TO TREAT HER
APPROACHING QUIETLY SHE KNELT ON
THE CARPET AT HER SIDE AND LOOKED OVER HER LITTLE SHOULDER AT HER BOOK
IT WAS A ROMANCE OF MRS
RADCLIFFE'S THE ITALIAN
CAROLINE READ ON WITH HER MAKING NO REMARK
PRESENTLY ROSE SHOWED HER
THE ATTENTION OF ASKING ERE SHE TURNED THE LEAF ARE YOU READY
CAROLINE ONLY NODDED
DO YOU LIKE IT INQUIRED ROSE ERE LONG
LONG SINCE WHEN I READ IT AS A CHILD I WAS WONDERFULLY TAKEN WITH
IT
WHY
IT SEEMED TO OPEN WITH SUCH PROMISE SUCH FOREBODING OF A MOST STRANGE
TALE TO BE UNFOLDED
AND IN READING IT YOU FEEL AS IF YOU WERE FAR AWAY FROM ENGLAND REALLY
IN ITALY UNDER ANOTHER SORT OF SKY THAT BLUE SKY OF THE SOUTH WHICH
TRAVELLERS DESCRIBE
YOU ARE SENSIBLE OF THAT ROSE
IT MAKES ME LONG TO TRAVEL MISS HELSTONE
WHEN YOU ARE A WOMAN PERHAPS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GRATIFY YOUR WISH
I MEAN TO MAKE A WAY TO DO SO IF ONE IS NOT MADE FOR ME
I CANNOT LIVE
ALWAYS IN BRIARFIELD
THE WHOLE WORLD IS NOT VERY LARGE COMPARED WITH
CREATION
I MUST SEE THE OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN ROUND PLANET AT LEAST
HOW MUCH OF ITS OUTSIDE
FIRST THIS HEMISPHERE WHERE WE LIVE THEN THE OTHER
I AM RESOLVED THAT
MY LIFE SHALL BE A LIFE
NOT A BLACK TRANCE LIKE THE TOAD'S BURIED IN
MARBLE NOR A LONG SLOW DEATH LIKE YOURS IN BRIARFIELD RECTORY
LIKE MINE WHAT CAN YOU MEAN CHILD
MIGHT YOU NOT AS WELL BE TEDIOUSLY DYING AS FOR EVER SHUT UP IN THAT
GLEBE HOUSE A PLACE THAT WHEN I PASS IT ALWAYS REMINDS ME OF A
WINDOWED GRAVE I NEVER SEE ANY MOVEMENT ABOUT THE DOOR
I NEVER HEAR A
SOUND FROM THE WALL
I BELIEVE SMOKE NEVER ISSUES FROM THE CHIMNEYS
WHAT DO YOU DO THERE
I SEW I READ I LEARN LESSONS
ARE YOU HAPPY
SHOULD I BE HAPPY WANDERING ALONE IN STRANGE COUNTRIES AS YOU WISH TO
DO
MUCH HAPPIER EVEN IF YOU DID NOTHING BUT WANDER
REMEMBER HOWEVER
THAT I SHALL HAVE AN OBJECT IN VIEW BUT IF YOU ONLY WENT ON AND ON
LIKE SOME ENCHANTED LADY IN A FAIRY TALE YOU MIGHT BE HAPPIER THAN NOW
IN A DAY'S WANDERING YOU WOULD PASS MANY A HILL WOOD AND WATERCOURSE
EACH PERPETUALLY ALTERING IN ASPECT AS THE SUN SHONE OUT OR WAS
OVERCAST AS THE WEATHER WAS WET OR FAIR DARK OR BRIGHT
NOTHING
CHANGES IN BRIARFIELD RECTORY
THE PLASTER OF THE PARLOUR CEILINGS THE
PAPER ON THE WALLS THE CURTAINS CARPETS CHAIRS ARE STILL THE SAME
IS CHANGE NECESSARY TO HAPPINESS
YES
IS IT SYNONYMOUS WITH IT
I DON'T KNOW BUT I FEEL MONOTONY AND DEATH TO BE ALMOST THE SAME
HERE JESSIE SPOKE
ISN'T SHE MAD SHE ASKED
BUT ROSE PURSUED CAROLINE I FEAR A WANDERER'S LIFE FOR ME AT
LEAST WOULD END LIKE THAT TALE YOU ARE READING IN DISAPPOINTMENT
VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
DOES 'THE ITALIAN' SO END
I THOUGHT SO WHEN I READ IT
BETTER TO TRY ALL THINGS AND FIND ALL EMPTY THAN TO TRY NOTHING AND
LEAVE YOUR LIFE A BLANK
TO DO THIS IS TO COMMIT THE SIN OF HIM WHO
BURIED HIS TALENT IN A NAPKIN DESPICABLE SLUGGARD
ROSE OBSERVED MRS
YORKE SOLID SATISFACTION IS ONLY TO BE REALIZED
BY DOING ONE'S DUTY
RIGHT MOTHER AND IF MY MASTER HAS GIVEN ME TEN TALENTS MY DUTY IS TO
TRADE WITH THEM AND MAKE THEM TEN TALENTS MORE
NOT IN THE DUST OF
HOUSEHOLD DRAWERS SHALL THE COIN BE INTERRED
I WILL NOT DEPOSIT IT IN
A BROKEN SPOUTED TEAPOT AND SHUT IT UP IN A CHINA CLOSET AMONG
TEA THINGS
I WILL NOT COMMIT IT TO YOUR WORK TABLE TO BE SMOTHERED IN
PILES OF WOOLLEN HOSE
I WILL NOT PRISON IT IN THE LINEN PRESS TO FIND
SHROUDS AMONG THE SHEETS
AND LEAST OF ALL MOTHER SHE GOT UP FROM THE
FLOOR LEAST OF ALL WILL I HIDE IT IN A TUREEN OF COLD POTATOES TO BE
RANGED WITH BREAD BUTTER PASTRY AND HAM ON THE SHELVES OF THE
LARDER
SHE STOPPED THEN WENT ON MOTHER THE LORD WHO GAVE EACH OF US OUR
TALENTS WILL COME HOME SOME DAY AND WILL DEMAND FROM ALL AN ACCOUNT
THE TEAPOT THE OLD STOCKING FOOT THE LINEN RAG THE WILLOW PATTERN
TUREEN WILL YIELD UP THEIR BARREN DEPOSIT IN MANY A HOUSE
SUFFER YOUR
DAUGHTERS AT LEAST TO PUT THEIR MONEY TO THE EXCHANGERS THAT THEY MAY
BE ENABLED AT THE MASTER'S COMING TO PAY HIM HIS OWN WITH USURY
ROSE DID YOU BRING YOUR SAMPLER WITH YOU AS I TOLD YOU
YES MOTHER
SIT DOWN AND DO A LINE OF MARKING
ROSE SAT DOWN PROMPTLY AND WROUGHT ACCORDING TO ORDERS
AFTER A BUSY
PAUSE OF TEN MINUTES HER MOTHER ASKED DO YOU THINK YOURSELF OPPRESSED
NOW A VICTIM
NO MOTHER
YET AS FAR AS I UNDERSTOOD YOUR TIRADE IT WAS A PROTEST AGAINST ALL
WOMANLY AND DOMESTIC EMPLOYMENT
YOU MISUNDERSTOOD IT MOTHER
I SHOULD BE SORRY NOT TO LEARN TO SEW
YOU DO RIGHT TO TEACH ME AND TO MAKE ME WORK
EVEN TO THE MENDING OF YOUR BROTHERS' STOCKINGS AND THE MAKING OF
SHEETS
YES
WHERE IS THE USE OF RANTING AND SPOUTING ABOUT IT THEN
AM I TO DO NOTHING BUT THAT I WILL DO THAT AND THEN I WILL DO MORE
NOW MOTHER I HAVE SAID MY SAY
I AM TWELVE YEARS OLD AT PRESENT AND
NOT TILL I AM SIXTEEN WILL I SPEAK AGAIN ABOUT TALENTS
FOR FOUR YEARS I
BIND MYSELF AN INDUSTRIOUS APPRENTICE TO ALL YOU CAN TEACH ME
YOU SEE WHAT MY DAUGHTERS ARE MISS HELSTONE OBSERVED MRS
YORKE
HOW PRECOCIOUSLY WISE IN THEIR OWN CONCEITS 'I WOULD RATHER THIS I
PREFER THAT' SUCH IS JESSIE'S CUCKOO SONG WHILE ROSE UTTERS THE BOLDER
CRY 'I WILL AND I WILL NOT
I RENDER A REASON MOTHER BESIDES IF MY CRY IS BOLD IT IS ONLY HEARD
ONCE IN A TWELVEMONTH
ABOUT EACH BIRTHDAY THE SPIRIT MOVES ME TO
DELIVER ONE ORACLE RESPECTING MY OWN INSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT
I UTTER
IT AND LEAVE IT IT IS FOR YOU MOTHER TO LISTEN OR NOT
I WOULD ADVISE ALL YOUNG LADIES PURSUED MRS
YORKE TO STUDY THE
CHARACTERS OF SUCH CHILDREN AS THEY CHANCE TO MEET WITH BEFORE THEY
MARRY AND HAVE ANY OF THEIR OWN TO CONSIDER WELL HOW THEY WOULD LIKE
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GUIDING THE CARELESS THE LABOUR OF PERSUADING THE
STUBBORN THE CONSTANT BURDEN AND TASK OF TRAINING THE BEST
BUT WITH LOVE IT NEED NOT BE SO VERY DIFFICULT INTERPOSED CAROLINE
MOTHERS LOVE THEIR CHILDREN MOST DEARLY ALMOST BETTER THAN THEY LOVE
THEMSELVES
FINE TALK VERY SENTIMENTAL THERE IS THE ROUGH PRACTICAL PART OF LIFE
YET TO COME FOR YOU YOUNG MISS
BUT MRS
YORKE IF I TAKE A LITTLE BABY INTO MY ARMS ANY POOR WOMAN'S
INFANT FOR INSTANCE I FEEL THAT I LOVE THAT HELPLESS THING QUITE
PECULIARLY THOUGH I AM NOT ITS MOTHER
I COULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING FOR
IT WILLINGLY IF IT WERE DELIVERED OVER ENTIRELY TO MY CARE IF IT WERE
QUITE DEPENDENT ON ME
YOU FEEL YES YES I DARE SAY NOW
YOU ARE LED A GREAT DEAL BY YOUR
FEELINGS AND YOU THINK YOURSELF A VERY SENSITIVE PERSONAGE NO DOUBT
ARE YOU AWARE THAT WITH ALL THESE ROMANTIC IDEAS YOU HAVE MANAGED TO
TRAIN YOUR FEATURES INTO AN HABITUALLY LACKADAISICAL EXPRESSION BETTER
SUITED TO A NOVEL HEROINE THAN TO A WOMAN WHO IS TO MAKE HER WAY IN THE
REAL WORLD BY DINT OF COMMON SENSE
NO I AM NOT AT ALL AWARE OF THAT MRS
YORKE
LOOK IN THE GLASS JUST BEHIND YOU
COMPARE THE FACE YOU SEE THERE WITH
THAT OF ANY EARLY RISING HARD WORKING MILKMAID
MY FACE IS A PALE ONE BUT IT IS NOT SENTIMENTAL AND MOST MILKMAIDS
HOWEVER RED AND ROBUST THEY MAY BE ARE MORE STUPID AND LESS PRACTICALLY
FITTED TO MAKE THEIR WAY IN THE WORLD THAN I AM
I THINK MORE AND MORE
CORRECTLY THAN MILKMAIDS IN GENERAL DO CONSEQUENTLY WHERE THEY WOULD
OFTEN FOR WANT OF REFLECTION ACT WEAKLY I BY DINT OF REFLECTION
SHOULD ACT JUDICIOUSLY
OH NO YOU WOULD BE INFLUENCED BY YOUR FEELINGS YOU WOULD BE GUIDED BY
IMPULSE
OF COURSE I SHOULD OFTEN BE INFLUENCED BY MY FEELINGS
THEY WERE GIVEN
ME TO THAT END
WHOM MY FEELINGS TEACH ME TO LOVE I MUST AND SHALL
LOVE AND I HOPE IF EVER I HAVE A HUSBAND AND CHILDREN MY FEELINGS
WILL INDUCE ME TO LOVE THEM
I HOPE IN THAT CASE ALL MY IMPULSES WILL
BE STRONG IN COMPELLING ME TO LOVE
CAROLINE HAD A PLEASURE IN SAYING THIS WITH EMPHASIS SHE HAD A PLEASURE
IN DARING TO SAY IT IN MRS
YORKE'S PRESENCE
SHE DID NOT CARE WHAT
UNJUST SARCASM MIGHT BE HURLED AT HER IN REPLY
SHE FLUSHED NOT WITH
ANGER BUT EXCITEMENT WHEN THE UNGENIAL MATRON ANSWERED COOLLY DON'T
WASTE YOUR DRAMATIC EFFECTS
THAT WAS WELL SAID IT WAS QUITE FINE BUT
IT IS LOST ON TWO WOMEN AN OLD WIFE AND AN OLD MAID
THERE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN A DISENGAGED GENTLEMAN PRESENT IS MR
ROBERT NOWHERE HID BEHIND
THE CURTAINS DO YOU THINK MISS MOORE
HORTENSE WHO DURING THE CHIEF PART OF THE CONVERSATION HAD BEEN IN THE
KITCHEN SUPERINTENDING THE PREPARATIONS FOR TEA DID NOT YET QUITE
COMPREHEND THE DRIFT OF THE DISCOURSE
SHE ANSWERED WITH A PUZZLED AIR
THAT ROBERT WAS AT WHINBURY
MRS
YORKE LAUGHED HER OWN PECULIAR SHORT
LAUGH
STRAIGHTFORWARD MISS MOORE SAID SHE PATRONIZINGLY
IT IS LIKE YOU TO
UNDERSTAND MY QUESTION SO LITERALLY AND ANSWER IT SO SIMPLY
YOUR MIND
COMPREHENDS NOTHING OF INTRIGUE
STRANGE THINGS MIGHT GO ON AROUND YOU
WITHOUT YOUR BEING THE WISER YOU ARE NOT OF THE CLASS THE WORLD CALLS
SHARP WITTED
THESE EQUIVOCAL COMPLIMENTS DID NOT SEEM TO PLEASE HORTENSE
SHE DREW
HERSELF UP PUCKERED HER BLACK EYEBROWS BUT STILL LOOKED PUZZLED
I HAVE EVER BEEN NOTED FOR SAGACITY AND DISCERNMENT FROM CHILDHOOD
SHE RETURNED FOR INDEED ON THE POSSESSION OF THESE QUALITIES SHE
PECULIARLY PIQUED HERSELF
YOU NEVER PLOTTED TO WIN A HUSBAND I'LL BE BOUND PURSUED MRS
YORKE
AND YOU HAVE NOT THE BENEFIT OF PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE TO AID YOU IN
DISCOVERING WHEN OTHERS PLOT
CAROLINE FELT THIS KIND LANGUAGE WHERE THE BENEVOLENT SPEAKER INTENDED
SHE SHOULD FEEL IT IN HER VERY HEART
SHE COULD NOT EVEN PARRY THE
SHAFTS SHE WAS DEFENCELESS FOR THE PRESENT
TO ANSWER WOULD HAVE BEEN
TO AVOW THAT THE CAP FITTED
MRS
YORKE LOOKING AT HER AS SHE SAT WITH
TROUBLED DOWNCAST EYES AND CHEEK BURNING PAINFULLY AND FIGURE
EXPRESSING IN ITS BENT ATTITUDE AND UNCONSCIOUS TREMOR ALL THE
HUMILIATION AND CHAGRIN SHE EXPERIENCED FELT THE SUFFERER WAS FAIR
GAME
THE STRANGE WOMAN HAD A NATURAL ANTIPATHY TO A SHRINKING
SENSITIVE CHARACTER A NERVOUS TEMPERAMENT NOR WAS A PRETTY DELICATE
AND YOUTHFUL FACE A PASSPORT TO HER AFFECTIONS
IT WAS SELDOM SHE MET
WITH ALL THESE OBNOXIOUS QUALITIES COMBINED IN ONE INDIVIDUAL STILL
MORE SELDOM SHE FOUND THAT INDIVIDUAL AT HER MERCY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES
IN WHICH SHE COULD CRUSH HER WELL
SHE HAPPENED THIS AFTERNOON TO BE
SPECIALLY BILIOUS AND MOROSE AS MUCH DISPOSED TO GORE AS ANY VICIOUS
MOTHER OF THE HERD LOWERING HER LARGE HEAD SHE MADE A NEW CHARGE
YOUR COUSIN HORTENSE IS AN EXCELLENT SISTER MISS HELSTONE
SUCH LADIES
AS COME TO TRY THEIR LIFE'S LUCK HERE AT HOLLOW'S COTTAGE MAY BY A VERY
LITTLE CLEVER FEMALE ARTIFICE CAJOLE THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND
HAVE THE GAME ALL IN THEIR OWN HANDS
YOU ARE FOND OF YOUR COUSIN'S
SOCIETY I DARE SAY MISS
OF WHICH COUSIN'S
OH OF THE LADY'S OF COURSE
HORTENSE IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN MOST KIND TO ME
EVERY SISTER WITH AN ELIGIBLE SINGLE BROTHER IS CONSIDERED MOST KIND BY
HER SPINSTER FRIENDS
MRS
YORKE SAID CAROLINE LIFTING HER EYES SLOWLY THEIR BLUE ORBS AT
THE SAME TIME CLEARING FROM TROUBLE AND SHINING STEADY AND FULL WHILE
THE GLOW OF SHAME LEFT HER CHEEK AND ITS HUE TURNED PALE AND
SETTLED MRS
YORKE MAY I ASK WHAT YOU MEAN
TO GIVE YOU A LESSON ON THE CULTIVATION OF RECTITUDE TO DISGUST YOU
WITH CRAFT AND FALSE SENTIMENT
DO I NEED THIS LESSON
MOST YOUNG LADIES OF THE PRESENT DAY NEED IT
YOU ARE QUITE A MODERN
YOUNG LADY MORBID DELICATE PROFESSING TO LIKE RETIREMENT WHICH
IMPLIES I SUPPOSE THAT YOU FIND LITTLE WORTHY OF YOUR SYMPATHIES IN
THE ORDINARY WORLD
THE ORDINARY WORLD EVERY DAY HONEST FOLKS ARE
BETTER THAN YOU THINK THEM MUCH BETTER THAN ANY BOOKISH ROMANCING CHIT
OF A GIRL CAN BE WHO HARDLY EVER PUTS HER NOSE OVER HER UNCLE THE
PARSON'S GARDEN WALL
CONSEQUENTLY OF WHOM YOU KNOW NOTHING
EXCUSE ME INDEED IT DOES NOT
MATTER WHETHER YOU EXCUSE ME OR NOT YOU HAVE ATTACKED ME WITHOUT
PROVOCATION I SHALL DEFEND MYSELF WITHOUT APOLOGY
OF MY RELATIONS WITH
MY TWO COUSINS YOU ARE IGNORANT
IN A FIT OF ILL HUMOUR YOU HAVE
ATTEMPTED TO POISON THEM BY GRATUITOUS INSINUATIONS WHICH ARE FAR MORE
CRAFTY AND FALSE THAN ANYTHING WITH WHICH YOU CAN JUSTLY CHARGE ME
THAT
I HAPPEN TO BE PALE AND SOMETIMES TO LOOK DIFFIDENT IS NO BUSINESS OF
YOURS THAT I AM FOND OF BOOKS AND INDISPOSED FOR COMMON GOSSIP IS
STILL LESS YOUR BUSINESS THAT I AM A 'ROMANCING CHIT OF A GIRL' IS A
MERE CONJECTURE ON YOUR PART
I NEVER ROMANCED TO YOU NOR TO ANYBODY YOU
KNOW
THAT I AM THE PARSON'S NIECE IS NOT A CRIME THOUGH YOU MAY BE
NARROW MINDED ENOUGH TO THINK IT SO
YOU DISLIKE ME
YOU HAVE NO JUST
REASON FOR DISLIKING ME THEREFORE KEEP THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR AVERSION
TO YOURSELF
IF AT ANY TIME IN FUTURE YOU EVINCE IT ANNOYINGLY I SHALL
ANSWER EVEN LESS SCRUPULOUSLY THAN I HAVE DONE NOW
SHE CEASED AND SAT IN WHITE AND STILL EXCITEMENT
SHE HAD SPOKEN IN THE
CLEAREST OF TONES NEITHER FAST NOR LOUD BUT HER SILVER ACCENTS
THRILLED THE EAR
THE SPEED OF THE CURRENT IN HER VEINS WAS JUST THEN AS
SWIFT AS IT WAS VIEWLESS
MRS
YORKE WAS NOT IRRITATED AT THE REPROOF WORDED WITH A SEVERITY SO
SIMPLE DICTATED BY A PRIDE SO QUIET
TURNING COOLLY TO MISS MOORE SHE
SAID NODDING HER CAP APPROVINGLY SHE HAS SPIRIT IN HER AFTER
ALL ALWAYS SPEAK AS HONESTLY AS YOU HAVE DONE JUST NOW SHE
CONTINUED AND YOU'LL DO
I REPEL A RECOMMENDATION SO OFFENSIVE WAS THE ANSWER DELIVERED IN
THE SAME PURE KEY WITH THE SAME CLEAR LOOK
I REJECT COUNSEL POISONED
BY INSINUATION
IT IS MY RIGHT TO SPEAK AS I THINK PROPER NOTHING BINDS
ME TO CONVERSE AS YOU DICTATE
SO FAR FROM ALWAYS SPEAKING AS I HAVE
DONE JUST NOW I SHALL NEVER ADDRESS ANY ONE IN A TONE SO STERN OR IN
LANGUAGE SO HARSH UNLESS IN ANSWER TO UNPROVOKED INSULT
MOTHER YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR MATCH PRONOUNCED LITTLE JESSIE WHOM THE
SCENE APPEARED GREATLY TO EDIFY
ROSE HAD HEARD THE WHOLE WITH AN
UNMOVED FACE
SHE NOW SAID NO MISS HELSTONE IS NOT MY MOTHER'S MATCH
FOR SHE ALLOWS HERSELF TO BE VEXED
MY MOTHER WOULD WEAR HER OUT IN A
FEW WEEKS
SHIRLEY KEELDAR MANAGES BETTER MOTHER YOU HAVE NEVER HURT
MISS KEELDAR'S FEELINGS YET
SHE WEARS ARMOUR UNDER HER SILK DRESS THAT
YOU CANNOT PENETRATE
MRS
YORKE OFTEN COMPLAINED THAT HER CHILDREN WERE MUTINOUS
IT WAS
STRANGE THAT WITH ALL HER STRICTNESS WITH ALL HER STRONG MINDEDNESS
SHE COULD GAIN NO COMMAND OVER THEM
A LOOK FROM THEIR FATHER HAD MORE
INFLUENCE WITH THEM THAN A LECTURE FROM HER
MISS MOORE TO WHOM THE POSITION OF WITNESS TO AN ALTERCATION IN WHICH
SHE TOOK NO PART WAS HIGHLY DISPLEASING AS BEING AN UNIMPORTANT
SECONDARY POST NOW RALLYING HER DIGNITY PREPARED TO UTTER A DISCOURSE
WHICH WAS TO PROVE BOTH PARTIES IN THE WRONG AND TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO
EACH DISPUTANT THAT SHE HAD REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF AND OUGHT
TO SUBMIT HUMBLY TO THE SUPERIOR SENSE OF THE INDIVIDUAL THEN ADDRESSING
HER
FORTUNATELY FOR HER AUDIENCE SHE HAD NOT HARANGUED ABOVE TEN
MINUTES WHEN SARAH'S ENTRANCE WITH THE TEA TRAY CALLED HER ATTENTION
FIRST TO THE FACT OF THAT DAMSEL HAVING A GILT COMB IN HER HAIR AND A
RED NECKLACE ROUND HER THROAT AND SECONDLY AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO A
POINTED REMONSTRANCE TO THE DUTY OF MAKING TEA
AFTER THE MEAL ROSE
RESTORED HER TO GOOD HUMOUR BY BRINGING HER GUITAR AND ASKING FOR A
SONG AND AFTERWARDS ENGAGING HER IN AN INTELLIGENT AND SHARP
CROSS EXAMINATION ABOUT GUITAR PLAYING AND MUSIC IN GENERAL
JESSIE MEANTIME DIRECTED HER ASSIDUITIES TO CAROLINE
SITTING ON A
STOOL AT HER FEET SHE TALKED TO HER FIRST ABOUT RELIGION AND THEN
ABOUT POLITICS
JESSIE WAS ACCUSTOMED AT HOME TO DRINK IN A GREAT DEAL
OF WHAT HER FATHER SAID ON THESE SUBJECTS AND AFTERWARDS IN COMPANY TO
RETAIL WITH MORE WIT AND FLUENCY THAN CONSISTENCY OR DISCRETION HIS
OPINIONS ANTIPATHIES AND PREFERENCES
SHE RATED CAROLINE SOUNDLY FOR
BEING A MEMBER OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH AND FOR HAVING AN UNCLE A
CLERGYMAN
SHE INFORMED HER THAT SHE LIVED ON THE COUNTRY AND OUGHT TO
WORK FOR HER LIVING HONESTLY INSTEAD OF PASSING A USELESS LIFE AND
EATING THE BREAD OF IDLENESS IN THE SHAPE OF TITHES
THENCE JESSIE
PASSED TO A REVIEW OF THE MINISTRY AT THAT TIME IN OFFICE AND A
CONSIDERATION OF ITS DESERTS
SHE MADE FAMILIAR MENTION OF THE NAMES OF
LORD CASTLEREAGH AND MR
PERCEVAL
EACH OF THESE PERSONAGES SHE ADORNED
WITH A CHARACTER THAT MIGHT HAVE SEPARATELY SUITED MOLOCH AND BELIAL
SHE DENOUNCED THE WAR AS WHOLESALE MURDER AND LORD WELLINGTON AS A
HIRED BUTCHER
HER AUDITRESS LISTENED WITH EXCEEDING EDIFICATION
JESSIE HAD SOMETHING
OF THE GENIUS OF HUMOUR IN HER NATURE
IT WAS INEXPRESSIBLY COMIC TO
HEAR HER REPEATING HER SIRE'S DENUNCIATIONS IN HIS NERVOUS NORTHERN
DORIC AS HEARTY A LITTLE JACOBIN AS EVER PENT A FREE MUTINOUS SPIRIT IN
A MUSLIN FROCK AND SASH
NOT MALIGNANT BY NATURE HER LANGUAGE WAS NOT
SO BITTER AS IT WAS RACY AND THE EXPRESSIVE LITTLE FACE GAVE A PIQUANCY
TO EVERY PHRASE WHICH HELD A BEHOLDER'S INTEREST CAPTIVE
CAROLINE CHID HER WHEN SHE ABUSED LORD WELLINGTON BUT SHE LISTENED
DELIGHTED TO A SUBSEQUENT TIRADE AGAINST THE PRINCE REGENT
JESSIE
QUICKLY READ IN THE SPARKLE OF HER HEARER'S EYE AND THE LAUGHTER
HOVERING ROUND HER LIPS THAT AT LAST SHE HAD HIT ON A TOPIC THAT
PLEASED
MANY A TIME HAD SHE HEARD THE FAT ADONIS OF FIFTY DISCUSSED
AT HER FATHER'S BREAKFAST TABLE AND SHE NOW GAVE MR
YORKE'S COMMENTS
ON THE THEME GENUINE AS UTTERED BY HIS YORKSHIRE LIPS
BUT JESSIE I WILL WRITE ABOUT YOU NO MORE
THIS IS AN AUTUMN EVENING
WET AND WILD
THERE IS ONLY ONE CLOUD IN THE SKY BUT IT CURTAINS IT
FROM POLE TO POLE
THE WIND CANNOT REST IT HURRIES SOBBING OVER HILLS
OF SULLEN OUTLINE COLOURLESS WITH TWILIGHT AND MIST
RAIN HAS BEAT ALL
DAY ON THAT CHURCH TOWER
IT RISES DARK FROM THE STONY ENCLOSURE OF ITS
GRAVEYARD
THE NETTLES THE LONG GRASS AND THE TOMBS ALL DRIP WITH WET
THIS EVENING REMINDS ME TOO FORCIBLY OF ANOTHER EVENING SOME YEARS
AGO A HOWLING RAINY AUTUMN EVENING TOO WHEN CERTAIN WHO HAD THAT DAY
PERFORMED A PILGRIMAGE TO A GRAVE NEW MADE IN A HERETIC CEMETERY SAT
NEAR A WOOD FIRE ON THE HEARTH OF A FOREIGN DWELLING
THEY WERE MERRY
AND SOCIAL BUT THEY EACH KNEW THAT A GAP NEVER TO BE FILLED HAD BEEN
MADE IN THEIR CIRCLE
THEY KNEW THEY HAD LOST SOMETHING WHOSE ABSENCE
COULD NEVER BE QUITE ATONED FOR SO LONG AS THEY LIVED AND THEY KNEW
THAT HEAVY FALLING RAIN WAS SOAKING INTO THE WET EARTH WHICH COVERED
THEIR LOST DARLING AND THAT THE SAD SIGHING GALE WAS MOURNING ABOVE
HER BURIED HEAD
THE FIRE WARMED THEM LIFE AND FRIENDSHIP YET BLESSED
THEM BUT JESSIE LAY COLD COFFINED SOLITARY ONLY THE SOD SCREENING
HER FROM THE STORM
MRS
YORKE FOLDED UP HER KNITTING CUT SHORT THE MUSIC LESSON AND THE
LECTURE ON POLITICS AND CONCLUDED HER VISIT TO THE COTTAGE AT AN HOUR
EARLY ENOUGH TO ENSURE HER RETURN TO BRIARMAINS BEFORE THE BLUSH OF
SUNSET SHOULD QUITE HAVE FADED IN HEAVEN OR THE PATH UP THE FIELDS HAVE
BECOME THOROUGHLY MOIST WITH EVENING DEW
THE LADY AND HER DAUGHTERS BEING GONE CAROLINE FELT THAT SHE ALSO OUGHT
TO RESUME HER SCARF KISS HER COUSIN'S CHEEK AND TRIP AWAY HOMEWARD
IF
SHE LINGERED MUCH LATER DUSK WOULD DRAW ON AND FANNY WOULD BE PUT TO
THE TROUBLE OF COMING TO FETCH HER
IT WAS BOTH BAKING AND IRONING DAY
AT THE RECTORY SHE REMEMBERED FANNY WOULD BE BUSY
STILL SHE COULD
NOT QUIT HER SEAT AT THE LITTLE PARLOUR WINDOW
FROM NO POINT OF VIEW
COULD THE WEST LOOK SO LOVELY AS FROM THAT LATTICE WITH THE GARLAND OF
JESSAMINE ROUND IT WHOSE WHITE STARS AND GREEN LEAVES SEEMED NOW BUT
GRAY PENCIL OUTLINES GRACEFUL IN FORM BUT COLOURLESS IN TINT AGAINST
THE GOLD INCARNADINED OF A SUMMER EVENING AGAINST THE FIRE TINGED BLUE
OF AN AUGUST SKY AT EIGHT O'CLOCK P M
CAROLINE LOOKED AT THE WICKET GATE BESIDE WHICH HOLLY OAKS SPIRED UP
TALL
SHE LOOKED AT THE CLOSE HEDGE OF PRIVET AND LAUREL FENCING IN THE
GARDEN HER EYES LONGED TO SEE SOMETHING MORE THAN THE SHRUBS BEFORE
THEY TURNED FROM THAT LIMITED PROSPECT
THEY LONGED TO SEE A HUMAN
FIGURE OF A CERTAIN MOULD AND HEIGHT PASS THE HEDGE AND ENTER THE
GATE
A HUMAN FIGURE SHE AT LAST SAW NAY TWO
FREDERICK MURGATROYD
WENT BY CARRYING A PAIL OF WATER JOE SCOTT FOLLOWED DANGLING ON HIS
FOREFINGER THE KEYS OF THE MILL
THEY WERE GOING TO LOCK UP MILL AND
STABLES FOR THE NIGHT AND THEN BETAKE THEMSELVES HOME
SO MUST I THOUGHT CAROLINE AS SHE HALF ROSE AND SIGHED
THIS IS ALL FOLLY HEART BREAKING FOLLY SHE ADDED
IN THE FIRST
PLACE THOUGH I SHOULD STAY TILL DARK THERE WILL BE NO ARRIVAL BECAUSE
I FEEL IN MY HEART FATE HAS WRITTEN IT DOWN IN TO DAY'S PAGE OF HER
ETERNAL BOOK THAT I AM NOT TO HAVE THE PLEASURE I LONG FOR
IN THE
SECOND PLACE IF HE STEPPED IN THIS MOMENT MY PRESENCE HERE WOULD BE A
CHAGRIN TO HIM AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT MUST BE SO WOULD TURN HALF
MY BLOOD TO ICE
HIS HAND WOULD PERHAPS BE LOOSE AND CHILL IF I PUT
MINE INTO IT HIS EYE WOULD BE CLOUDED IF I SOUGHT ITS BEAM
I SHOULD
LOOK UP FOR THAT KINDLING SOMETHING I HAVE SEEN IN PAST DAYS WHEN MY
FACE OR MY LANGUAGE OR MY DISPOSITION HAD AT SOME HAPPY MOMENT PLEASED
HIM I SHOULD DISCOVER ONLY DARKNESS
I HAD BETTER GO HOME
SHE TOOK HER BONNET FROM THE TABLE WHERE IT LAY AND WAS JUST FASTENING
THE RIBBON WHEN HORTENSE DIRECTING HER ATTENTION TO A SPLENDID BOUQUET
OF FLOWERS IN A GLASS ON THE SAME TABLE MENTIONED THAT MISS KEELDAR HAD
SENT THEM THAT MORNING FROM FIELDHEAD AND WENT ON TO COMMENT ON THE
GUESTS THAT LADY WAS AT PRESENT ENTERTAINING ON THE BUSTLING LIFE SHE
HAD LATELY BEEN LEADING ADDING DIVERS CONJECTURES THAT SHE DID NOT VERY
WELL LIKE IT AND MUCH WONDERMENT THAT A PERSON WHO WAS SO FOND OF HER
OWN WAY AS THE HEIRESS DID NOT FIND SOME MEANS OF SOONER GETTING RID OF
THIS CORTGE OF RELATIVES
BUT THEY SAY SHE ACTUALLY WILL NOT LET MR
SYMPSON AND HIS FAMILY GO
SHE ADDED
THEY WANTED MUCH TO RETURN TO THE SOUTH LAST WEEK TO BE
READY FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE ONLY SON WHO IS EXPECTED HOME FROM A
TOUR
SHE INSISTS THAT HER COUSIN HENRY SHALL COME AND JOIN HIS FRIENDS
HERE IN YORKSHIRE
I DARE SAY SHE PARTLY DOES IT TO OBLIGE ROBERT AND
MYSELF
HOW TO OBLIGE ROBERT AND YOU INQUIRED CAROLINE
WHY MY CHILD YOU ARE DULL
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU MUST OFTEN HAVE
HEARD
PLEASE MA'AM SAID SARAH OPENING THE DOOR THE PRESERVES THAT YOU
TOLD ME TO BOIL IN TREACLE THE CONGFITERS AS YOU CALL THEM IS ALL
BURNT TO THE PAN
LES CONFITURES ELLES SONT BRLES AH QUELLE NGLIGENCE COUPABLE
COQUINE DE CUISINIRE FILLE INSUPPORTABLE
AND MADEMOISELLE HASTILY TAKING FROM A DRAWER A LARGE LINEN APRON AND
TYING IT OVER HER BLACK APRON RUSHED PERDUE INTO THE KITCHEN
WHENCE TO SPEAK TRUTH EXHALED AN ODOUR OF CALCINED SWEETS RATHER
STRONG THAN SAVOURY
THE MISTRESS AND MAID HAD BEEN IN FULL FEUD THE WHOLE DAY ON THE
SUBJECT OF PRESERVING CERTAIN BLACK CHERRIES HARD AS MARBLES SOUR AS
SLOES
SARAH HELD THAT SUGAR WAS THE ONLY ORTHODOX CONDIMENT TO BE USED
IN THAT PROCESS MADEMOISELLE MAINTAINED AND PROVED IT BY THE PRACTICE
AND EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER GRANDMOTHER AND GREAT GRANDMOTHER THAT
TREACLE MLASSE WAS INFINITELY PREFERABLE
SHE HAD COMMITTED AN
IMPRUDENCE IN LEAVING SARAH IN CHARGE OF THE PRESERVING PAN FOR HER
WANT OF SYMPATHY IN THE NATURE OF ITS CONTENTS HAD INDUCED A DEGREE OF
CARELESSNESS IN WATCHING THEIR CONFECTION WHEREOF THE RESULT WAS DARK
AND CINDERY RUIN
HUBBUB FOLLOWED HIGH UPBRAIDING AND SOBS RATHER LOUD
THAN DEEP OR REAL
CAROLINE ONCE MORE TURNING TO THE LITTLE MIRROR WAS SHADING HER
RINGLETS FROM HER CHEEK TO SMOOTH THEM UNDER HER COTTAGE BONNET CERTAIN
THAT IT WOULD NOT ONLY BE USELESS BUT UNPLEASANT TO STAY LONGER WHEN
ON THE SUDDEN OPENING OF THE BACK DOOR THERE FELL AN ABRUPT CALM IN THE
KITCHEN
THE TONGUES WERE CHECKED PULLED UP AS WITH BIT AND BRIDLE
WAS IT WAS IT ROBERT HE OFTEN ALMOST ALWAYS ENTERED BY THE
KITCHEN WAY ON HIS RETURN FROM MARKET
NO IT WAS ONLY JOE SCOTT WHO
HAVING HEMMED SIGNIFICANTLY THRICE EVERY HEM BEING MEANT AS A LOFTY
REBUKE TO THE SQUABBLING WOMANKIND SAID NOW I THOWT I HEERD A
CRACK
NONE ANSWERED
AND HE CONTINUED PRAGMATICALLY AS T' MAISTER'S COMED AND AS HE'LL

BAKING BOWL SIR THEY'VE SET IT I' YER WAY FAIR AS IF THEY DID IT I'
MALICE
TO JOE'S OBSERVATIONS SUCCEEDED A CONFUSED SORT OF PAUSE WHICH
CAROLINE THOUGH SHE WAS LISTENING WITH BOTH HER EARS COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND
IT WAS VERY BRIEF
A CRY BROKE IT A SOUND OF SURPRISE
FOLLOWED BY THE SOUND OF A KISS EJACULATIONS BUT HALF ARTICULATE
SUCCEEDED
MON DIEU MON DIEU EST CE QUE JE M'Y ATTENDAIS WERE THE WORDS
CHIEFLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED
ET TU TE PORTES TOUJOURS BIEN BONNE SUR INQUIRED ANOTHER
VOICE ROBERT'S CERTAINLY
CAROLINE WAS PUZZLED
OBEYING AN IMPULSE THE WISDOM OF WHICH SHE HAD NOT
TIME TO QUESTION SHE ESCAPED FROM THE LITTLE PARLOUR BY WAY OF LEAVING
THE COAST CLEAR AND RUNNING UPSTAIRS TOOK UP A POSITION AT THE HEAD OF
THE BANISTERS WHENCE SHE COULD MAKE FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ERE PRESENTING
HERSELF
IT WAS CONSIDERABLY PAST SUNSET NOW DUSK FILLED THE PASSAGE
YET NOT SUCH DEEP DUSK BUT THAT SHE COULD PRESENTLY SEE ROBERT AND
HORTENSE TRAVERSE IT
CAROLINE CAROLINE CALLED HORTENSE A MOMENT AFTERWARDS VENEZ VOIR
MON FRRE
STRANGE COMMENTED MISS HELSTONE PASSING STRANGE WHAT DOES THIS
UNWONTED EXCITEMENT ABOUT SUCH AN EVERY DAY OCCURRENCE AS A RETURN FROM
MARKET PORTEND SHE HAS NOT LOST HER SENSES HAS SHE SURELY THE BURNT
TREACLE HAS NOT CRAZED HER
SHE DESCENDED IN A SUBDUED FLUTTER
YET MORE WAS SHE FLUTTERED WHEN
HORTENSE SEIZED HER HAND AT THE PARLOUR DOOR AND LEADING HER TO ROBERT
WHO STOOD IN BODILY PRESENCE TALL AND DARK AGAINST THE ONE WINDOW
PRESENTED HER WITH A MIXTURE OF AGITATION AND FORMALITY AS THOUGH THEY
HAD BEEN UTTER STRANGERS AND THIS WAS THEIR FIRST MUTUAL INTRODUCTION
INCREASING PUZZLE HE BOWED RATHER AWKWARDLY AND TURNING FROM HER WITH
A STRANGER'S EMBARRASSMENT HE MET THE DOUBTFUL LIGHT FROM THE WINDOW
IT FELL ON HIS FACE AND THE ENIGMA OF THE DREAM A DREAM IT SEEMED
WAS AT ITS HEIGHT
SHE SAW A VISAGE LIKE AND UNLIKE ROBERT AND NO
ROBERT
WHAT IS THE MATTER SAID CAROLINE
IS MY SIGHT WRONG IS IT MY
COUSIN
CERTAINLY IT IS YOUR COUSIN ASSERTED HORTENSE
THEN WHO WAS THIS NOW COMING THROUGH THE PASSAGE NOW ENTERING THE ROOM
CAROLINE LOOKING ROUND MET A NEW ROBERT THE REAL ROBERT AS SHE FELT

BUT YOU ARE NOT SO MUCH ALIKE
IT IS ONLY
YOUR HEIGHT YOUR FIGURE AND COMPLEXION THAT ARE SO SIMILAR
AND I AM ROBERT AM I NOT ASKED THE NEWCOMER MAKING A FIRST EFFORT
TO OVERCOME WHAT SEEMED HIS NATURAL SHYNESS
CAROLINE SHOOK HER HEAD GENTLY
A SOFT EXPRESSIVE RAY FROM HER EYE
BEAMED ON THE REAL ROBERT
IT SAID MUCH
SHE WAS NOT PERMITTED TO QUIT HER COUSINS SOON
ROBERT HIMSELF WAS
PEREMPTORY IN OBLIGING HER TO REMAIN
GLAD SIMPLE AND AFFABLE IN HER
DEMEANOUR GLAD FOR THIS NIGHT AT LEAST IN LIGHT BRIGHT SPIRITS FOR
THE TIME SHE WAS TOO PLEASANT AN ADDITION TO THE COTTAGE CIRCLE TO BE
WILLINGLY PARTED WITH BY ANY OF THEM
LOUIS SEEMED NATURALLY RATHER A
GRAVE STILL RETIRING MAN BUT THE CAROLINE OF THIS EVENING WHICH WAS
NOT AS YOU KNOW READER THE CAROLINE OF EVERY DAY THAWED HIS RESERVE
AND CHEERED HIS GRAVITY SOON
HE SAT NEAR HER AND TALKED TO HER
SHE
ALREADY KNEW HIS VOCATION WAS THAT OF TUITION
SHE LEARNED NOW HE HAD
FOR SOME YEARS BEEN THE TUTOR OF MR
SYMPSON'S SON THAT HE HAD BEEN
TRAVELLING WITH HIM AND HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE NORTH
SHE INQUIRED
IF HE LIKED HIS POST BUT GOT A LOOK IN REPLY WHICH DID NOT INVITE OR
LICENSE FURTHER QUESTION
THE LOOK WOKE CAROLINE'S READY SYMPATHY
SHE
THOUGHT IT A VERY SAD EXPRESSION TO PASS OVER SO SENSIBLE A FACE AS
LOUIS'S FOR HE HAD A SENSIBLE FACE THOUGH NOT HANDSOME SHE
CONSIDERED WHEN SEEN NEAR ROBERT'S
SHE TURNED TO MAKE THE COMPARISON
ROBERT WAS LEANING AGAINST THE WALL A LITTLE BEHIND HER TURNING OVER
THE LEAVES OF A BOOK OF ENGRAVINGS AND PROBABLY LISTENING AT THE SAME
TIME TO THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN HER AND LOUIS
HOW COULD I THINK THEM ALIKE SHE ASKED HERSELF
I SEE NOW IT IS
HORTENSE LOUIS RESEMBLES NOT ROBERT
AND THIS WAS IN PART TRUE
HE HAD THE SHORTER NOSE AND LONGER UPPER LIP
OF HIS SISTER RATHER THAN THE FINE TRAITS OF HIS BROTHER
HE HAD HER
MOULD OF MOUTH AND CHIN ALL LESS DECISIVE ACCURATE AND CLEAR THAN
THOSE OF THE YOUNG MILL OWNER
HIS AIR THOUGH DELIBERATE AND
REFLECTIVE COULD SCARCELY BE CALLED PROMPT AND ACUTE
YOU FELT IN
SITTING NEAR AND LOOKING UP AT HIM THAT A SLOWER AND PROBABLY A MORE
BENIGNANT NATURE THAN THAT OF THE ELDER MOORE SHED CALM ON YOUR
IMPRESSIONS
ROBERT PERHAPS AWARE THAT CAROLINE'S GLANCE HAD WANDERED TOWARDS AND
DWELT UPON HIM THOUGH HE HAD NEITHER MET NOR ANSWERED IT PUT DOWN THE
BOOK OF ENGRAVINGS AND APPROACHING TOOK A SEAT AT HER SIDE
SHE
RESUMED HER CONVERSATION WITH LOUIS BUT WHILE SHE TALKED TO HIM HER
THOUGHTS WERE ELSEWHERE
HER HEART BEAT ON THE SIDE FROM WHICH HER FACE
WAS HALF AVERTED
SHE ACKNOWLEDGED A STEADY MANLY KINDLY AIR IN LOUIS
BUT SHE BENT BEFORE THE SECRET POWER OF ROBERT
TO BE SO NEAR
HIM THOUGH HE WAS SILENT THOUGH HE DID NOT TOUCH SO MUCH AS HER
SCARF FRINGE OR THE WHITE HEM OF HER DRESS AFFECTED HER LIKE A SPELL
HAD SHE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK TO HIM ONLY IT WOULD HAVE QUELLED BUT
AT LIBERTY TO ADDRESS ANOTHER IT EXCITED HER
HER DISCOURSE FLOWED
FREELY IT WAS GAY PLAYFUL ELOQUENT
THE INDULGENT LOOK AND PLACID
MANNER OF HER AUDITOR ENCOURAGED HER TO EASE THE SOBER PLEASURE
EXPRESSED BY HIS SMILE DREW OUT ALL THAT WAS BRILLIANT IN HER NATURE
SHE FELT THAT THIS EVENING SHE APPEARED TO ADVANTAGE AND AS ROBERT WAS
A SPECTATOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS CONTENTED HER
HAD HE BEEN CALLED AWAY
COLLAPSE WOULD AT ONCE HAVE SUCCEEDED STIMULUS
BUT HER ENJOYMENT WAS NOT LONG TO SHINE FULL ORBED A CLOUD SOON CROSSED
IT
HORTENSE WHO FOR SOME TIME HAD BEEN ON THE MOVE ORDERING SUPPER AND
WAS NOW CLEARING THE LITTLE TABLE OF SOME BOOKS ETC TO MAKE ROOM FOR
THE TRAY CALLED ROBERT'S ATTENTION TO THE GLASS OF FLOWERS THE CARMINE
AND SNOW AND GOLD OF WHOSE PETALS LOOKED RADIANT INDEED BY CANDLELIGHT
THEY CAME FROM FIELDHEAD SHE SAID INTENDED AS A GIFT TO YOU NO
DOUBT
WE KNOW WHO IS THE FAVOURITE THERE NOT I I'M SURE
IT WAS A WONDER TO HEAR HORTENSE JEST A SIGN THAT HER SPIRITS WERE AT
HIGH WATER MARK INDEED
WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND THEN THAT ROBERT IS THE FAVOURITE OBSERVED
LOUIS
MON CHER REPLIED HORTENSE ROBERT C'EST TOUT CE QU'IL Y A DE PLUS
PRCIEUX AU MONDE CT DE LUI LE RESTE DU GENRE HUMAIN N'EST QUE DU
REBUT N'AI JE PAS RAISON MON ENFANT SHE ADDED APPEALING TO
CAROLINE
CAROLINE WAS OBLIGED TO REPLY YES AND HER BEACON WAS QUENCHED
HER
STAR WITHDREW AS SHE SPOKE
ET TOI ROBERT INQUIRED LOUIS
WHEN YOU SHALL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ASK HERSELF WAS THE QUIET ANSWER
WHETHER HE REDDENED OR PALED CAROLINE DID NOT EXAMINE
SHE DISCOVERED
THAT IT WAS LATE AND SHE MUST GO HOME
HOME SHE WOULD GO NOT EVEN
ROBERT COULD DETAIN HER NOW
CHAPTER XXIV
THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH
THE FUTURE SOMETIMES SEEMS TO SOB A LOW WARNING OF THE EVENTS IT IS
BRINGING US LIKE SOME GATHERING THOUGH YET REMOTE STORM WHICH IN
TONES OF THE WIND IN FLUSHINGS OF THE FIRMAMENT IN CLOUDS STRANGELY
TORN ANNOUNCES A BLAST STRONG TO STREW THE SEA WITH WRECKS OR
COMMISSIONED TO BRING IN FOG THE YELLOW TAINT OF PESTILENCE COVERING
WHITE WESTERN ISLES WITH THE POISONED EXHALATIONS OF THE EAST DIMMING
THE LATTICES OF ENGLISH HOMES WITH THE BREATH OF INDIAN PLAGUE
AT OTHER
TIMES THIS FUTURE BURSTS SUDDENLY AS IF A ROCK HAD RENT AND IN IT A
GRAVE HAD OPENED WHENCE ISSUES THE BODY OF ONE THAT SLEPT
ERE YOU ARE
AWARE YOU STAND FACE TO FACE WITH A SHROUDED AND UNTHOUGHT OF
CALAMITY A NEW LAZARUS
CAROLINE HELSTONE WENT HOME FROM HOLLOW'S COTTAGE IN GOOD HEALTH AS SHE
IMAGINED
ON WAKING THE NEXT MORNING SHE FELT OPPRESSED WITH UNWONTED
LANGUOR
AT BREAKFAST AT EACH MEAL OF THE FOLLOWING DAY SHE MISSED ALL
SENSE OF APPETITE
PALATABLE FOOD WAS AS ASHES AND SAWDUST TO HER
AM I ILL SHE ASKED AND LOOKED AT HERSELF IN THE GLASS
HER EYES WERE
BRIGHT THEIR PUPILS DILATED HER CHEEKS SEEMED ROSIER AND FULLER THAN
USUAL
I LOOK WELL WHY CAN I NOT EAT
SHE FELT A PULSE BEAT FAST IN HER TEMPLES SHE FELT TOO HER BRAIN IN
STRANGE ACTIVITY
HER SPIRITS WERE RAISED HUNDREDS OF BUSY AND BROKEN
BUT BRILLIANT THOUGHTS ENGAGED HER MIND
A GLOW RESTED ON THEM SUCH AS
TINGED HER COMPLEXION
NOW FOLLOWED A HOT PARCHED THIRSTY RESTLESS NIGHT
TOWARDS MORNING
ONE TERRIBLE DREAM SEIZED HER LIKE A TIGER WHEN SHE WOKE SHE FELT AND
KNEW SHE WAS ILL
HOW SHE HAD CAUGHT THE FEVER FEVER IT WAS SHE COULD NOT TELL
PROBABLY
IN HER LATE WALK HOME SOME SWEET POISONED BREEZE REDOLENT OF
HONEY DEW AND MIASMA HAD PASSED INTO HER LUNGS AND VEINS AND FINDING
THERE ALREADY A FEVER OF MENTAL EXCITEMENT AND A LANGUOR OF LONG
CONFLICT AND HABITUAL SADNESS HAD FANNED THE SPARK TO FLAME AND LEFT A
WELL LIT FIRE BEHIND IT
IT SEEMED HOWEVER BUT A GENTLE FIRE
AFTER TWO HOT DAYS AND WORRIED
NIGHTS THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE IN THE SYMPTOMS AND NEITHER HER UNCLE
NOR FANNY NOR THE DOCTOR NOR MISS KEELDAR WHEN SHE CALLED HAD ANY
FEAR FOR HER
A FEW DAYS WOULD RESTORE HER EVERY ONE BELIEVED
THE FEW DAYS PASSED AND THOUGH IT WAS STILL THOUGHT IT COULD NOT LONG
DELAY THE REVIVAL HAD NOT BEGUN
MRS
PRYOR WHO HAD VISITED HER
DAILY BEING PRESENT IN HER CHAMBER ONE MORNING WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ILL A
FORTNIGHT WATCHED HER VERY NARROWLY FOR SOME MINUTES
SHE TOOK HER HAND
AND PLACED HER FINGER ON HER WRIST THEN QUIETLY LEAVING THE CHAMBER
SHE WENT TO MR
HELSTONE'S STUDY
WITH HIM SHE REMAINED CLOSETED A LONG
TIME HALF THE MORNING
ON RETURNING TO HER SICK YOUNG FRIEND SHE LAID
ASIDE SHAWL AND BONNET
SHE STOOD AWHILE AT THE BEDSIDE ONE HAND PLACED
IN THE OTHER GENTLY ROCKING HERSELF TO AND FRO IN AN ATTITUDE AND WITH
A MOVEMENT HABITUAL TO HER
AT LAST SHE SAID I HAVE SENT FANNY TO
FIELDHEAD TO FETCH A FEW THINGS FOR ME SUCH AS I SHALL WANT DURING A
SHORT STAY HERE
IT IS MY WISH TO REMAIN WITH YOU TILL YOU ARE BETTER
YOUR UNCLE KINDLY PERMITS MY ATTENDANCE
WILL IT TO YOURSELF BE
ACCEPTABLE CAROLINE
I AM SORRY YOU SHOULD TAKE SUCH NEEDLESS TROUBLE
I DO NOT FEEL VERY
ILL BUT I CANNOT REFUSE RESOLUTELY
IT WILL BE SUCH COMFORT TO KNOW YOU
ARE IN THE HOUSE TO SEE YOU SOMETIMES IN THE ROOM BUT DON'T CONFINE
YOURSELF ON MY ACCOUNT DEAR MRS
PRYOR
FANNY NURSES ME VERY WELL
MRS
PRYOR BENDING OVER THE PALE LITTLE SUFFERER WAS NOW SMOOTHING THE
HAIR UNDER HER CAP AND GENTLY RAISING HER PILLOW
AS SHE PERFORMED
THESE OFFICES CAROLINE SMILING LIFTED HER FACE TO KISS HER
ARE YOU FREE FROM PAIN ARE YOU TOLERABLY AT EASE WAS INQUIRED IN A
LOW EARNEST VOICE AS THE SELF ELECTED NURSE YIELDED TO THE CARESS
I THINK I AM ALMOST HAPPY
YOU WISH TO DRINK YOUR LIPS ARE PARCHED
SHE HELD A GLASS FILLED WITH SOME COOLING BEVERAGE TO HER MOUTH
HAVE YOU EATEN ANYTHING TO DAY CAROLINE
I CANNOT EAT
BUT SOON YOUR APPETITE WILL RETURN IT MUST RETURN THAT IS I PRAY
GOD IT MAY
IN LAYING HER AGAIN ON THE COUCH SHE ENCIRCLED HER IN HER ARMS AND
WHILE SO DOING BY A MOVEMENT WHICH SEEMED SCARCELY VOLUNTARY SHE DREW
HER TO HER HEART AND HELD HER CLOSE GATHERED AN INSTANT
I SHALL HARDLY WISH TO GET WELL THAT I MAY KEEP YOU ALWAYS SAID
CAROLINE
MRS
PRYOR DID NOT SMILE AT THIS SPEECH
OVER HER FEATURES RAN A TREMOR
WHICH FOR SOME MINUTES SHE WAS ABSORBED IN REPRESSING
YOU ARE MORE USED TO FANNY THAN TO ME SHE REMARKED ERE LONG
I
SHOULD THINK MY ATTENDANCE MUST SEEM STRANGE OFFICIOUS
NO QUITE NATURAL AND VERY SOOTHING
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO
WAIT ON SICK PEOPLE MA'AM
YOU MOVE ABOUT THE ROOM SO SOFTLY AND YOU
SPEAK SO QUIETLY AND TOUCH ME SO GENTLY
I AM DEXTEROUS IN NOTHING MY DEAR
YOU WILL OFTEN FIND ME AWKWARD BUT
NEVER NEGLIGENT
NEGLIGENT INDEED SHE WAS NOT
FROM THAT HOUR FANNY AND ELIZA BECAME
CIPHERS IN THE SICK ROOM
MRS
PRYOR MADE IT HER DOMAIN SHE PERFORMED
ALL ITS DUTIES SHE LIVED IN IT DAY AND NIGHT
THE PATIENT
REMONSTRATED FAINTLY HOWEVER FROM THE FIRST AND NOT AT ALL ERE LONG
LONELINESS AND GLOOM WERE NOW BANISHED FROM HER BEDSIDE PROTECTION AND
SOLACE SAT THERE INSTEAD
SHE AND HER NURSE COALESCED IN WONDROUS UNION
CAROLINE WAS USUALLY PAINED TO REQUIRE OR RECEIVE MUCH ATTENDANCE
MRS
PRYOR UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HAD NEITHER THE HABIT NOR THE ART
OF PERFORMING LITTLE OFFICES OF SERVICE BUT ALL NOW PASSED WITH SUCH
EASE SO NATURALLY THAT THE PATIENT WAS AS WILLING TO BE CHERISHED AS
THE NURSE WAS BENT ON CHERISHING NO SIGN OF WEARINESS IN THE LATTER
EVER REMINDED THE FORMER THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE ANXIOUS
THERE WAS IN
FACT NO VERY HARD DUTY TO PERFORM BUT A HIRELING MIGHT HAVE FOUND IT
HARD
WITH ALL THIS CARE IT SEEMED STRANGE THE SICK GIRL DID NOT GET WELL YET
SUCH WAS THE CASE
SHE WASTED LIKE ANY SNOW WREATH IN THAW SHE FADED
LIKE ANY FLOWER IN DROUGHT
MISS KEELDAR ON WHOSE THOUGHTS DANGER OR
DEATH SELDOM INTRUDED HAD AT FIRST ENTERTAINED NO FEARS AT ALL FOR HER
FRIEND BUT SEEING HER CHANGE AND SINK FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN SHE PAID
HER VISITS ALARM CLUTCHED HER HEART
SHE WENT TO MR
HELSTONE AND
EXPRESSED HERSELF WITH SO MUCH ENERGY THAT THAT GENTLEMAN WAS AT LAST
OBLIGED HOWEVER UNWILLINGLY TO ADMIT THE IDEA THAT HIS NIECE WAS ILL
OF SOMETHING MORE THAN A MIGRAINE AND WHEN MRS
PRYOR CAME AND QUIETLY
DEMANDED A PHYSICIAN HE SAID SHE MIGHT SEND FOR TWO IF SHE LIKED
ONE
CAME BUT THAT ONE WAS AN ORACLE
HE DELIVERED A DARK SAYING OF WHICH
THE FUTURE WAS TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY WROTE SOME PRESCRIPTIONS GAVE SOME
DIRECTIONS THE WHOLE WITH AN AIR OF CRUSHING AUTHORITY POCKETED HIS
FEE AND WENT
PROBABLY HE KNEW WELL ENOUGH HE COULD DO NO GOOD BUT
DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY SO
STILL NO RUMOUR OF SERIOUS ILLNESS GOT WIND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
AT
HOLLOW'S COTTAGE IT WAS THOUGHT THAT CAROLINE HAD ONLY A SEVERE COLD
SHE HAVING WRITTEN A NOTE TO HORTENSE TO THAT EFFECT AND MADEMOISELLE
CONTENTED HERSELF WITH SENDING TWO POTS OF CURRANT JAM A RECIPE FOR A
TISANE AND A NOTE OF ADVICE
MRS
YORKE BEING TOLD THAT A PHYSICIAN HAD BEEN SUMMONED SNEERED AT THE
HYPOCHONDRIAC FANCIES OF THE RICH AND IDLE WHO SHE SAID HAVING
NOTHING BUT THEMSELVES TO THINK ABOUT MUST NEEDS SEND FOR A DOCTOR IF
ONLY SO MUCH AS THEIR LITTLE FINGER ACHED
THE RICH AND IDLE REPRESENTED IN THE PERSON OF CAROLINE WERE
MEANTIME FALLING FAST INTO A CONDITION OF PROSTRATION WHOSE QUICKLY
CONSUMMATED DEBILITY PUZZLED ALL WHO WITNESSED IT EXCEPT ONE FOR THAT
ONE ALONE REFLECTED HOW LIABLE IS THE UNDERMINED STRUCTURE TO SINK IN
SUDDEN RUIN
SICK PEOPLE OFTEN HAVE FANCIES INSCRUTABLE TO ORDINARY ATTENDANTS AND
CAROLINE HAD ONE WHICH EVEN HER TENDER NURSE COULD NOT AT FIRST EXPLAIN
ON A CERTAIN DAY IN THE WEEK AT A CERTAIN HOUR SHE WOULD WHETHER
WORSE OR BETTER ENTREAT TO BE TAKEN UP AND DRESSED AND SUFFERED TO SIT
IN HER CHAIR NEAR THE WINDOW
THIS STATION SHE WOULD RETAIN TILL NOON
WAS PAST
WHATEVER DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION OR DEBILITY HER WAN ASPECT
BETRAYED SHE STILL SOFTLY PUT OFF ALL PERSUASION TO SEEK REPOSE UNTIL
THE CHURCH CLOCK HAD DULY TOLLED MIDDAY
THE TWELVE STROKES SOUNDED SHE
GREW DOCILE AND WOULD MEEKLY LIE DOWN
RETURNED TO THE COUCH SHE
USUALLY BURIED HER FACE DEEP IN THE PILLOW AND DREW THE COVERLETS CLOSE
ROUND HER AS IF TO SHUT OUT THE WORLD AND SUN OF WHICH SHE WAS TIRED
MORE THAN ONCE AS SHE THUS LAY A SLIGHT CONVULSION SHOOK THE SICK BED
AND A FAINT SOB BROKE THE SILENCE ROUND IT
THESE THINGS WERE NOT
UNNOTED BY MRS
PRYOR
ONE TUESDAY MORNING AS USUAL SHE HAD ASKED LEAVE TO RISE AND NOW SHE
SAT WRAPPED IN HER WHITE DRESSING GOWN LEANING FORWARD IN THE
EASY CHAIR GAZING STEADILY AND PATIENTLY FROM THE LATTICE
MRS
PRYOR
WAS SEATED A LITTLE BEHIND KNITTING AS IT SEEMED BUT IN TRUTH
WATCHING HER
A CHANGE CROSSED HER PALE MOURNFUL BROW ANIMATING ITS
LANGUOR A LIGHT SHOT INTO HER FADED EYES REVIVING THEIR LUSTRE SHE
HALF ROSE AND LOOKED EARNESTLY OUT
MRS
PRYOR DRAWING SOFTLY NEAR
GLANCED OVER HER SHOULDER
FROM THIS WINDOW WAS VISIBLE THE CHURCHYARD
BEYOND IT THE ROAD AND THERE RIDING SHARPLY BY APPEARED A HORSEMAN
THE FIGURE WAS NOT YET TOO REMOTE FOR RECOGNITION
MRS
PRYOR HAD LONG
SIGHT SHE KNEW MR
MOORE
JUST AS AN INTERCEPTING RISING GROUND
CONCEALED HIM FROM VIEW THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE
MAY I LIE DOWN AGAIN ASKED CAROLINE
HER NURSE ASSISTED HER TO BED
HAVING LAID HER DOWN AND DRAWN THE
CURTAIN SHE STOOD LISTENING NEAR
THE LITTLE COUCH TREMBLED THE
SUPPRESSED SOB STIRRED THE AIR
A CONTRACTION AS OF ANGUISH ALTERED MRS
PRYOR'S FEATURES SHE WRUNG HER HANDS HALF A GROAN ESCAPED HER LIPS
SHE NOW REMEMBERED THAT TUESDAY WAS WHINBURY MARKET DAY
MR
MOORE MUST
ALWAYS PASS THE RECTORY ON HIS WAY THITHER JUST ERE NOON OF THAT DAY
CAROLINE WORE CONTINUALLY ROUND HER NECK A SLENDER BRAID OF SILK
ATTACHED TO WHICH WAS SOME TRINKET
MRS
PRYOR HAD SEEN THE BIT OF GOLD
GLISTEN BUT HAD NOT YET OBTAINED A FAIR VIEW OF IT
HER PATIENT NEVER
PARTED WITH IT
WHEN DRESSED IT WAS HIDDEN IN HER BOSOM AS SHE LAY IN
BED SHE ALWAYS HELD IT IN HER HAND
THAT TUESDAY AFTERNOON THE TRANSIENT
DOZE MORE LIKE LETHARGY THAN SLEEP WHICH SOMETIMES ABRIDGED THE LONG
DAYS HAD STOLEN OVER HER
THE WEATHER WAS HOT
WHILE TURNING IN FEBRILE
RESTLESSNESS SHE HAD PUSHED THE COVERLETS A LITTLE ASIDE
MRS
PRYOR
BENT TO REPLACE THEM
THE SMALL WASTED HAND LYING NERVELESS ON THE
SICK GIRL'S BREAST CLASPED AS USUAL HER JEALOUSLY GUARDED TREASURE
THOSE FINGERS WHOSE ATTENUATION IT GAVE PAIN TO SEE WERE NOW RELAXED IN
SLEEP
MRS
PRYOR GENTLY DISENGAGED THE BRAID DRAWING OUT A TINY
LOCKET A SLIGHT THING IT WAS SUCH AS IT SUITED HER SMALL PURSE TO
PURCHASE
UNDER ITS CRYSTAL FACE APPEARED A CURL OF BLACK HAIR TOO
SHORT AND CRISP TO HAVE BEEN SEVERED FROM A FEMALE HEAD
SOME AGITATED MOVEMENT OCCASIONED A TWITCH OF THE SILKEN CHAIN
THE
SLEEPER STARTED AND WOKE
HER THOUGHTS WERE USUALLY NOW SOMEWHAT
SCATTERED ON WAKING HER LOOK GENERALLY WANDERING
HALF RISING AS IF
IN TERROR SHE EXCLAIMED DON'T TAKE IT FROM ME ROBERT DON'T IT IS
MY LAST COMFORT LET ME KEEP IT
I NEVER TELL ANY ONE WHOSE HAIR IT IS
I NEVER SHOW IT
MRS
PRYOR HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE CURTAIN
RECLINING FAR
BACK IN A DEEP ARM CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE SHE WAS WITHDRAWN FROM VIEW
CAROLINE LOOKED ABROAD INTO THE CHAMBER SHE THOUGHT IT EMPTY
AS HER
STRAY IDEAS RETURNED SLOWLY EACH FOLDING ITS WEAK WINGS ON THE MIND'S
SAD SHORE LIKE BIRDS EXHAUSTED BEHOLDING VOID AND PERCEIVING SILENCE
ROUND HER SHE BELIEVED HERSELF ALONE
COLLECTED SHE WAS NOT YET
PERHAPS HEALTHY SELF POSSESSION AND SELF CONTROL WERE TO BE HERS NO
MORE PERHAPS THAT WORLD THE STRONG AND PROSPEROUS LIVE IN HAD ALREADY
ROLLED FROM BENEATH HER FEET FOR EVER
SO AT LEAST IT OFTEN SEEMED TO
HERSELF
IN HEALTH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THINK ALOUD BUT NOW
WORDS ESCAPED HER LIPS UNAWARES
OH I SHOULD SEE HIM ONCE MORE BEFORE ALL IS OVER HEAVEN MIGHT
FAVOUR ME THUS FAR SHE CRIED
GOD GRANT ME A LITTLE COMFORT BEFORE I
DIE WAS HER HUMBLE PETITION
BUT HE WILL NOT KNOW I AM ILL TILL I AM GONE AND HE WILL COME WHEN
THEY HAVE LAID ME OUT AND I AM SENSELESS COLD AND STIFF
WHAT CAN MY DEPARTED SOUL FEEL THEN CAN IT SEE OR KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO
THE CLAY CAN SPIRITS THROUGH ANY MEDIUM COMMUNICATE WITH LIVING
FLESH CAN THE DEAD AT ALL REVISIT THOSE THEY LEAVE CAN THEY COME IN
THE ELEMENTS WILL WIND WATER FIRE LEND ME A PATH TO MOORE
IS IT FOR NOTHING THE WIND SOUNDS ALMOST ARTICULATELY SOMETIMES SINGS
AS I HAVE LATELY HEARD IT SING AT NIGHT OR PASSES THE CASEMENT SOBBING
AS IF FOR SORROW TO COME DOES NOTHING THEN HAUNT IT NOTHING INSPIRE
IT
WHY IT SUGGESTED TO ME WORDS ONE NIGHT IT POURED A STRAIN WHICH I
COULD HAVE WRITTEN DOWN ONLY I WAS APPALLED AND DARED NOT RISE TO SEEK
PENCIL AND PAPER BY THE DIM WATCH LIGHT
WHAT IS THAT ELECTRICITY THEY SPEAK OF WHOSE CHANGES MAKE US WELL OR
ILL WHOSE LACK OR EXCESS BLASTS WHOSE EVEN BALANCE REVIVES WHAT ARE
ALL THOSE INFLUENCES THAT ARE ABOUT US IN THE ATMOSPHERE THAT KEEP
PLAYING OVER OUR NERVES LIKE FINGERS ON STRINGED INSTRUMENTS AND CALL
FORTH NOW A SWEET NOTE AND NOW A WAIL NOW AN EXULTANT SWELL AND ANON
THE SADDEST CADENCE
WHERE IS THE OTHER WORLD IN WHAT WILL ANOTHER LIFE CONSIST WHY DO
I ASK HAVE I NOT CAUSE TO THINK THAT THE HOUR IS HASTING BUT TOO FAST
WHEN THE VEIL MUST BE RENT FOR ME DO I NOT KNOW THE GRAND MYSTERY IS
LIKELY TO BURST PREMATURELY ON ME GREAT SPIRIT IN WHOSE GOODNESS I
CONFIDE WHOM AS MY FATHER I HAVE PETITIONED NIGHT AND MORNING FROM
EARLY INFANCY HELP THE WEAK CREATION OF THY HANDS SUSTAIN ME THROUGH
THE ORDEAL I DREAD AND MUST UNDERGO GIVE ME STRENGTH GIVE ME PATIENCE
GIVE ME OH GIVE ME FAITH
SHE FELL BACK ON HER PILLOW
MRS
PRYOR FOUND MEANS TO STEAL QUIETLY
FROM THE ROOM
SHE RE ENTERED IT SOON AFTER APPARENTLY AS COMPOSED AS
IF SHE HAD REALLY NOT OVERHEARD THIS STRANGE SOLILOQUY
THE NEXT DAY SEVERAL CALLERS CAME
IT HAD BECOME KNOWN THAT MISS
HELSTONE WAS WORSE
MR
HALL AND HIS SISTER MARGARET ARRIVED
BOTH
AFTER THEY HAD BEEN IN THE SICKROOM QUITTED IT IN TEARS THEY HAD FOUND
THE PATIENT MORE ALTERED THAN THEY EXPECTED
HORTENSE MOORE CAME
CAROLINE SEEMED STIMULATED BY HER PRESENCE
SHE ASSURED HER SMILING
SHE WAS NOT DANGEROUSLY ILL SHE TALKED TO HER IN A LOW VOICE BUT
CHEERFULLY
DURING HER STAY EXCITEMENT KEPT UP THE FLUSH OF HER
COMPLEXION SHE LOOKED BETTER
HOW IS MR
ROBERT ASKED MRS
PRYOR AS HORTENSE WAS PREPARING TO TAKE
LEAVE
HE WAS VERY WELL WHEN HE LEFT
LEFT IS HE GONE FROM HOME
IT WAS THEN EXPLAINED THAT SOME POLICE INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE RIOTERS OF
WHOM HE WAS IN PURSUIT HAD THAT MORNING CALLED HIM AWAY TO BIRMINGHAM
AND PROBABLY A FORTNIGHT MIGHT ELAPSE ERE HE RETURNED
HE IS NOT AWARE THAT MISS HELSTONE IS VERY ILL
OH NO HE THOUGHT LIKE ME THAT SHE HAD ONLY A BAD COLD
AFTER THIS VISIT MRS
PRYOR TOOK CARE NOT TO APPROACH CAROLINE'S COUCH
FOR ABOVE AN HOUR
SHE HEARD HER WEEP AND DARED NOT LOOK ON HER TEARS
AS EVENING CLOSED IN SHE BROUGHT HER SOME TEA
CAROLINE OPENING HER
EYES FROM A MOMENT'S SLUMBER VIEWED HER NURSE WITH AN UNRECOGNIZING
GLANCE
I SMELT THE HONEYSUCKLES IN THE GLEN THIS SUMMER MORNING SHE SAID
AS I STOOD AT THE COUNTING HOUSE WINDOW
STRANGE WORDS LIKE THESE FROM PALLID LIPS PIERCE A LOVING LISTENER'S
HEART MORE POIGNANTLY THAN STEEL
THEY SOUND ROMANTIC PERHAPS IN
BOOKS IN REAL LIFE THEY ARE HARROWING
MY DARLING DO YOU KNOW ME SAID MRS
PRYOR
I WENT IN TO CALL ROBERT TO BREAKFAST
I HAVE BEEN WITH HIM IN THE
GARDEN
HE ASKED ME TO GO
A HEAVY DEW HAS REFRESHED THE FLOWERS
THE
PEACHES ARE RIPENING
MY DARLING MY DARLING AGAIN AND AGAIN REPEATED THE NURSE
I THOUGHT IT WAS DAYLIGHT LONG AFTER SUNRISE
IT LOOKS DARK
IS THE
MOON NOW SET
THAT MOON LATELY RISEN WAS GAZING FULL AND MILD UPON HER
FLOATING IN
DEEP BLUE SPACE IT WATCHED HER UNCLOUDED
THEN IT IS NOT MORNING I AM NOT AT THE COTTAGE WHO IS THIS I SEE A
SHAPE AT MY BEDSIDE
IT IS MYSELF IT IS YOUR FRIEND YOUR NURSE YOUR LEAN YOUR HEAD ON
MY SHOULDER
COLLECT YOURSELF IN A LOWER TONE O GOD TAKE PITY GIVE
HER LIFE AND ME STRENGTH SEND ME COURAGE TEACH ME WORDS
SOME MINUTES PASSED IN SILENCE
THE PATIENT LAY MUTE AND PASSIVE IN THE
TREMBLING ARMS ON THE THROBBING BOSOM OF THE NURSE
I AM BETTER NOW WHISPERED CAROLINE AT LAST MUCH BETTER
I FEEL
WHERE I AM
THIS IS MRS
PRYOR NEAR ME
I WAS DREAMING
I TALK WHEN I
WAKE UP FROM DREAMS PEOPLE OFTEN DO IN ILLNESS
HOW FAST YOUR HEART
BEATS MA'AM DO NOT BE AFRAID
IT IS NOT FEAR CHILD ONLY A LITTLE ANXIETY WHICH WILL PASS
I HAVE
BROUGHT YOU SOME TEA CARY
YOUR UNCLE MADE IT HIMSELF
YOU KNOW HE SAYS
HE CAN MAKE A BETTER CUP OF TEA THAN ANY HOUSEWIFE CAN
TASTE IT
HE IS
CONCERNED TO HEAR THAT YOU EAT SO LITTLE HE WOULD BE GLAD IF YOU HAD A
BETTER APPETITE
I AM THIRSTY
LET ME DRINK
SHE DRANK EAGERLY
WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT MA'AM SHE ASKED
PAST NINE
NOT LATER OH I HAVE YET A LONG NIGHT BEFORE ME
BUT THE TEA HAS MADE
ME STRONG
I WILL SIT UP
MRS
PRYOR RAISED HER AND ARRANGED HER PILLOWS
THANK HEAVEN I AM NOT ALWAYS EQUALLY MISERABLE AND ILL AND HOPELESS
THE AFTERNOON HAS BEEN BAD SINCE HORTENSE WENT PERHAPS THE EVENING MAY
BE BETTER
IT IS A FINE NIGHT I THINK THE MOON SHINES CLEAR
VERY FINE A PERFECT SUMMER NIGHT
THE OLD CHURCH TOWER GLEAMS WHITE
ALMOST AS SILVER
AND DOES THE CHURCHYARD LOOK PEACEFUL
YES AND THE GARDEN ALSO
DEW GLISTENS ON THE FOLIAGE
CAN YOU SEE MANY LONG WEEDS AND NETTLES AMONGST THE GRAVES OR DO THEY
LOOK TURFY AND FLOWERY
I SEE CLOSED DAISY HEADS GLEAMING LIKE PEARLS ON SOME MOUNDS
THOMAS
HAS MOWN DOWN THE DOCK LEAVES AND RANK GRASS AND CLEARED ALL AWAY
I ALWAYS LIKE THAT TO BE DONE IT SOOTHES ONE'S MIND TO SEE THE PLACE
IN ORDER
AND I DARE SAY WITHIN THE CHURCH JUST NOW THAT MOONLIGHT
SHINES AS SOFTLY AS IN MY ROOM
IT WILL FALL THROUGH THE EAST WINDOW
FULL ON THE HELSTONE MONUMENT
WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES I SEEM TO SEE POOR
PAPA'S EPITAPH IN BLACK LETTERS ON THE WHITE MARBLE
THERE IS PLENTY OF
ROOM FOR OTHER INSCRIPTIONS UNDERNEATH
WILLIAM FARREN CAME TO LOOK AFTER YOUR FLOWERS THIS MORNING
HE WAS
AFRAID NOW YOU CANNOT TEND THEM YOURSELF THEY WOULD BE NEGLECTED
HE
HAS TAKEN TWO OF YOUR FAVOURITE PLANTS HOME TO NURSE FOR YOU
IF I WERE TO MAKE A WILL I WOULD LEAVE WILLIAM ALL MY PLANTS SHIRLEY
MY TRINKETS EXCEPT ONE WHICH MUST NOT BE TAKEN OFF MY NECK AND YOU
MA'AM MY BOOKS AFTER A PAUSE MRS
PRYOR I FEEL A LONGING WISH FOR
SOMETHING
FOR WHAT CAROLINE
YOU KNOW I ALWAYS DELIGHT TO HEAR YOU SING
SING ME A HYMN JUST NOW
SING THAT HYMN WHICH BEGINS
'OUR GOD OUR HELP IN AGES PAST
OUR HOPE FOR YEARS TO COME
OUR SHELTER FROM THE STORMY BLAST
OUR REFUGE HAVEN HOME
MRS
PRYOR AT ONCE COMPLIED
NO WONDER CAROLINE LIKED TO HEAR HER SING
HER VOICE EVEN IN SPEAKING
WAS SWEET AND SILVER CLEAR IN SONG IT WAS ALMOST DIVINE
NEITHER FLUTE
NOR DULCIMER HAS TONES SO PURE
BUT THE TONE WAS SECONDARY COMPARED TO
THE EXPRESSION WHICH TREMBLED THROUGH A TENDER VIBRATION FROM A FEELING
HEART
THE SERVANTS IN THE KITCHEN HEARING THE STRAIN STOLE TO THE STAIR FOOT
TO LISTEN
EVEN OLD HELSTONE AS HE WALKED IN THE GARDEN PONDERING OVER
THE UNACCOUNTABLE AND FEEBLE NATURE OF WOMEN STOOD STILL AMONGST HIS
BORDERS TO CATCH THE MOURNFUL MELODY MORE DISTINCTLY
WHY IT REMINDED
HIM OF HIS FORGOTTEN DEAD WIFE HE COULD NOT TELL NOR WHY IT MADE HIM
MORE CONCERNED THAN HE HAD HITHERTO BEEN FOR CAROLINE'S FADING GIRLHOOD
HE WAS GLAD TO RECOLLECT THAT HE HAD PROMISED TO PAY WYNNE THE
MAGISTRATE A VISIT THAT EVENING
LOW SPIRITS AND GLOOMY THOUGHTS WERE
VERY MUCH HIS AVERSION
WHEN THEY ATTACKED HIM HE USUALLY FOUND MEANS TO
MAKE THEM MARCH IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME
THE HYMN FOLLOWED HIM FAINTLY AS
HE CROSSED THE FIELDS
HE HASTENED HIS CUSTOMARY SHARP PACE THAT HE
MIGHT GET BEYOND ITS REACH
THY WORD COMMANDS OUR FLESH TO DUST
'RETURN YE SONS OF MEN
ALL NATIONS ROSE FROM EARTH AT FIRST
AND TURN TO EARTH AGAIN
A THOUSAND AGES IN THY SIGHT
ARE LIKE AN EVENING GONE
SHORT AS THE WATCH THAT ENDS THE NIGHT
BEFORE THE RISING SUN
TIME LIKE AN EVER ROLLING STREAM
BEARS ALL ITS SONS AWAY
THEY FLY FORGOTTEN AS A DREAM
DIES AT THE OPENING DAY
LIKE FLOWERY FIELDS THE NATIONS STAND
FRESH IN THE MORNING LIGHT
THE FLOWERS BENEATH THE MOWER'S HAND
LIE WITHERING ERE 'TIS NIGHT
OUR GOD OUR HELP IN AGES PAST
OUR HOPE FOR YEARS TO COME
BE THOU OUR GUARD WHILE TROUBLES LAST
O FATHER BE OUR HOME
NOW SING A SONG A SCOTTISH SONG SUGGESTED CAROLINE WHEN THE HYMN
WAS OVER 'YE BANKS AND BRAES O' BONNIE DOON
AGAIN MRS
PRYOR OBEYED OR ESSAYED TO OBEY
AT THE CLOSE OF THE FIRST
STANZA SHE STOPPED
SHE COULD GET NO FURTHER
HER FULL HEART FLOWED
OVER
YOU ARE WEEPING AT THE PATHOS OF THE AIR
COME HERE AND I WILL COMFORT
YOU SAID CAROLINE IN A PITYING ACCENT
MRS
PRYOR CAME
SHE SAT DOWN
ON THE EDGE OF HER PATIENT'S BED AND ALLOWED THE WASTED ARMS TO
ENCIRCLE HER
YOU OFTEN SOOTHE ME LET ME SOOTHE YOU MURMURED THE YOUNG GIRL
KISSING HER CHEEK
I HOPE SHE ADDED IT IS NOT FOR ME YOU WEEP
NO ANSWER FOLLOWED
DO YOU THINK I SHALL NOT GET BETTER I DO NOT FEEL VERY ILL ONLY
WEAK
BUT YOUR MIND CAROLINE YOUR MIND IS CRUSHED
YOUR HEART IS ALMOST
BROKEN YOU HAVE BEEN SO NEGLECTED SO REPULSED LEFT SO DESOLATE
I BELIEVE GRIEF IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN MY WORST AILMENT
I SOMETIMES
THINK IF AN ABUNDANT GUSH OF HAPPINESS CAME ON ME I COULD REVIVE YET
DO YOU WISH TO LIVE
I HAVE NO OBJECT IN LIFE
YOU LOVE ME CAROLINE
VERY MUCH VERY TRULY INEXPRESSIBLY SOMETIMES
JUST NOW I FEEL AS IF I
COULD ALMOST GROW TO YOUR HEART
I WILL RETURN DIRECTLY DEAR REMARKED MRS
PRYOR AS SHE LAID
CAROLINE DOWN
QUITTING HER SHE GLIDED TO THE DOOR SOFTLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE LOCK
ASCERTAINED THAT IT WAS FAST AND CAME BACK
SHE BENT OVER HER
SHE
THREW BACK THE CURTAIN TO ADMIT THE MOONLIGHT MORE FREELY
SHE GAZED
INTENTLY ON HER FACE
THEN IF YOU LOVE ME SAID SHE SPEAKING QUICKLY WITH AN ALTERED
VOICE IF YOU FEEL AS IF TO USE YOUR OWN WORDS YOU COULD 'GROW TO MY
HEART IT WILL BE NEITHER SHOCK NOR PAIN FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT THAT
HEART IS THE SOURCE WHENCE YOURS WAS FILLED THAT FROM MY VEINS ISSUED
THE TIDE WHICH FLOWS IN YOURS THAT YOU ARE MINE MY DAUGHTER MY
OWN CHILD
MRS
PRYOR
MY OWN CHILD
THAT IS THAT MEANS YOU HAVE ADOPTED ME
IT MEANS THAT IF I HAVE GIVEN YOU NOTHING ELSE I AT LEAST GAVE YOU
LIFE THAT I BORE YOU NURSED YOU THAT I AM YOUR TRUE MOTHER
NO OTHER
WOMAN CAN CLAIM THE TITLE IT IS MINE
BUT MRS
JAMES HELSTONE BUT MY FATHER'S WIFE WHOM I DO NOT REMEMBER
EVER TO HAVE SEEN SHE IS MY MOTHER
SHE IS YOUR MOTHER
JAMES HELSTONE WAS MY HUSBAND
I SAY YOU ARE
MINE
I HAVE PROVED IT
I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU WERE ALL HIS WHICH
WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUEL DISPENSATION FOR ME
I FIND IT IS NOT SO
GOD
PERMITTED ME TO BE THE PARENT OF MY CHILD'S MIND
IT BELONGS TO ME IT
IS MY PROPERTY MY RIGHT
THESE FEATURES ARE JAMES'S OWN
HE HAD A
FINE FACE WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND NOT ALTERED BY ERROR
PAPA MY DARLING
GAVE YOU YOUR BLUE EYES AND SOFT BROWN HAIR HE GAVE YOU THE OVAL OF
YOUR FACE AND THE REGULARITY OF YOUR LINEAMENTS THE OUTSIDE HE
CONFERRED BUT THE HEART AND THE BRAIN ARE MINE
THE GERMS ARE FROM
ME AND THEY ARE IMPROVED THEY ARE DEVELOPED TO EXCELLENCE
I ESTEEM
AND APPROVE MY CHILD AS HIGHLY AS I DO MOST FONDLY LOVE HER
IS WHAT I HEAR TRUE IS IT NO DREAM
I WISH IT WERE AS TRUE THAT THE SUBSTANCE AND COLOUR OF HEALTH WERE
RESTORED TO YOUR CHEEK
MY OWN MOTHER IS SHE ONE I CAN BE SO FOND OF AS I CAN OF YOU PEOPLE
GENERALLY DID NOT LIKE HER SO I HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND
THEY TOLD YOU THAT WELL YOUR MOTHER NOW TELLS YOU THAT NOT HAVING
THE GIFT TO PLEASE PEOPLE GENERALLY FOR THEIR APPROBATION SHE DOES NOT
CARE
HER THOUGHTS ARE CENTRED IN HER CHILD
DOES THAT CHILD WELCOME OR
REJECT HER
BUT IF YOU ARE MY MOTHER THE WORLD IS ALL CHANGED TO ME
SURELY I
CAN LIVE
I SHOULD LIKE TO RECOVER
YOU MUST RECOVER
YOU DREW LIFE AND STRENGTH FROM MY BREAST WHEN YOU
WERE A TINY FAIR INFANT OVER WHOSE BLUE EYES I USED TO WEEP FEARING I
BEHELD IN YOUR VERY BEAUTY THE SIGN OF QUALITIES THAT HAD ENTERED MY
HEART LIKE IRON AND PIERCED THROUGH MY SOUL LIKE A SWORD
DAUGHTER WE
HAVE BEEN LONG PARTED I RETURN NOW TO CHERISH YOU AGAIN
SHE HELD HER TO HER BOSOM SHE CRADLED HER IN HER ARMS SHE ROCKED HER
SOFTLY AS IF LULLING A YOUNG CHILD TO SLEEP
MY MOTHER MY OWN MOTHER
THE OFFSPRING NESTLED TO THE PARENT THAT PARENT FEELING THE ENDEARMENT
AND HEARING THE APPEAL GATHERED HER CLOSER STILL
SHE COVERED HER WITH
NOISELESS KISSES SHE MURMURED LOVE OVER HER LIKE A CUSHAT FOSTERING
ITS YOUNG
THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE ROOM FOR A LONG WHILE
DOES MY UNCLE KNOW
YOUR UNCLE KNOWS
I TOLD HIM WHEN I FIRST CAME TO STAY WITH YOU HERE
DID YOU RECOGNIZE ME WHEN WE FIRST MET AT FIELDHEAD
HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE MR
AND MISS HELSTONE BEING ANNOUNCED I WAS
PREPARED TO SEE MY CHILD
IT WAS THAT THEN WHICH MOVED YOU
I SAW YOU DISTURBED
YOU SAW NOTHING CAROLINE I CAN COVER MY FEELINGS
YOU CAN NEVER TELL
WHAT AN AGE OF STRANGE SENSATION I LIVED DURING THE TWO MINUTES THAT
ELAPSED BETWEEN THE REPORT OF YOUR NAME AND YOUR ENTRANCE
YOU CAN NEVER
TELL HOW YOUR LOOK MIEN CARRIAGE SHOOK ME
WHY WERE YOU DISAPPOINTED
WHAT WILL SHE BE LIKE I HAD ASKED MYSELF AND WHEN I SAW WHAT YOU WERE
LIKE I COULD HAVE DROPPED
MAMMA WHY
I TREMBLED IN YOUR PRESENCE
I SAID I WILL NEVER OWN HER SHE SHALL
NEVER KNOW ME
BUT I SAID AND DID NOTHING REMARKABLE
I FELT A LITTLE DIFFIDENT AT THE
THOUGHT OF AN INTRODUCTION TO STRANGERS THAT WAS ALL
I SOON SAW YOU WERE DIFFIDENT
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING WHICH REASSURED
ME
HAD YOU BEEN RUSTIC CLOWNISH AWKWARD I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT
YOU PUZZLE ME
I HAD REASON TO DREAD A FAIR OUTSIDE TO MISTRUST A POPULAR BEARING TO
SHUDDER BEFORE DISTINCTION GRACE AND COURTESY
BEAUTY AND AFFABILITY
HAD COME IN MY WAY WHEN I WAS RECLUSE DESOLATE YOUNG AND IGNORANT A
TOIL WORN GOVERNESS PERISHING OF UNCHEERED LABOUR BREAKING DOWN BEFORE
HER TIME
THESE CAROLINE WHEN THEY SMILED ON ME I MISTOOK FOR ANGELS
I FOLLOWED THEM HOME AND WHEN INTO THEIR HANDS I HAD GIVEN WITHOUT
RESERVE MY WHOLE CHANCE OF FUTURE HAPPINESS IT WAS MY LOT TO WITNESS A
TRANSFIGURATION ON THE DOMESTIC HEARTH TO SEE THE WHITE MASK LIFTED
THE BRIGHT DISGUISE PUT AWAY AND OPPOSITE ME SAT DOWN O GOD I
HAVE SUFFERED
SHE SANK ON THE PILLOW
I HAVE SUFFERED NONE SAW NONE KNEW
THERE WAS NO SYMPATHY NO
REDEMPTION NO REDRESS
TAKE COMFORT MOTHER
IT IS OVER NOW
IT IS OVER AND NOT FRUITLESSLY
I TRIED TO KEEP THE WORD OF HIS
PATIENCE
HE KEPT ME IN THE DAYS OF MY ANGUISH
I WAS AFRAID WITH
TERROR I WAS TROUBLED
THROUGH GREAT TRIBULATION HE BROUGHT ME THROUGH
TO A SALVATION REVEALED IN THIS LAST TIME
MY FEAR HAD TORMENT HE HAS
CAST IT OUT
HE HAS GIVEN ME IN ITS STEAD PERFECT LOVE
BUT
CAROLINE
THUS SHE INVOKED HER DAUGHTER AFTER A PAUSE
MOTHER
I CHARGE YOU WHEN YOU NEXT LOOK ON YOUR FATHER'S MONUMENT TO RESPECT
THE NAME CHISELLED THERE
TO YOU HE DID ONLY GOOD
ON YOU HE CONFERRED
HIS WHOLE TREASURE OF BEAUTIES NOR ADDED TO THEM ONE DARK DEFECT
ALL
YOU DERIVED FROM HIM IS EXCELLENT
YOU OWE HIM GRATITUDE
LEAVE
BETWEEN HIM AND ME THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR MUTUAL ACCOUNT
MEDDLE NOT
GOD IS THE ARBITER
THIS WORLD'S LAWS NEVER CAME NEAR US NEVER THEY
WERE POWERLESS AS A ROTTEN BULRUSH TO PROTECT ME IMPOTENT AS IDIOT
BABBLINGS TO RESTRAIN HIM AS YOU SAID IT IS ALL OVER NOW THE GRAVE
LIES BETWEEN US
THERE HE SLEEPS IN THAT CHURCH
TO HIS DUST I SAY THIS
NIGHT WHAT I HAVE NEVER SAID BEFORE 'JAMES SLUMBER PEACEFULLY SEE
YOUR TERRIBLE DEBT IS CANCELLED LOOK I WIPE OUT THE LONG BLACK
ACCOUNT WITH MY OWN HAND JAMES YOUR CHILD ATONES
THIS LIVING LIKENESS
OF YOU THIS THING WITH YOUR PERFECT FEATURES THIS ONE GOOD GIFT YOU
GAVE ME HAS NESTLED AFFECTIONATELY TO MY HEART AND TENDERLY CALLED ME
MOTHER HUSBAND REST FORGIVEN
DEAREST MOTHER THAT IS RIGHT CAN PAPA'S SPIRIT HEAR US IS HE
COMFORTED TO KNOW THAT WE STILL LOVE HIM
I SAID NOTHING OF LOVE
I SPOKE OF FORGIVENESS
MIND THE TRUTH CHILD
I SAID NOTHING OF LOVE ON THE THRESHOLD OF ETERNITY SHOULD HE BE THERE
TO SEE ME ENTER WILL I MAINTAIN THAT
O MOTHER YOU MUST HAVE SUFFERED
O CHILD THE HUMAN HEART CAN SUFFER IT CAN HOLD MORE TEARS THAN THE
OCEAN HOLDS WATERS
WE NEVER KNOW HOW DEEP HOW WIDE IT IS TILL MISERY
BEGINS TO UNBIND HER CLOUDS AND FILL IT WITH RUSHING BLACKNESS
MOTHER FORGET
FORGET SHE SAID WITH THE STRANGEST SPECTRE OF A LAUGH
THE NORTH
POLE WILL RUSH TO THE SOUTH AND THE HEADLANDS OF EUROPE BE LOCKED INTO
THE BAYS OF AUSTRALIA ERE I FORGET
HUSH MOTHER REST BE AT PEACE
AND THE CHILD LULLED THE PARENT AS THE PARENT HAD ERST LULLED THE
CHILD
AT LAST MRS
PRYOR WEPT
SHE THEN GREW CALMER
SHE RESUMED THOSE
TENDER CARES AGITATION HAD FOR A MOMENT SUSPENDED
REPLACING HER
DAUGHTER ON THE COUCH SHE SMOOTHED THE PILLOW AND SPREAD THE SHEET
THE
SOFT HAIR WHOSE LOCKS WERE LOOSENED SHE REARRANGED THE DAMP BROW SHE
REFRESHED WITH A COOL FRAGRANT ESSENCE
MAMMA LET THEM BRING A CANDLE THAT I MAY SEE YOU AND TELL MY UNCLE
TO COME INTO THIS ROOM BY AND BY
I WANT TO HEAR HIM SAY THAT I AM YOUR
DAUGHTER
AND MAMMA TAKE YOUR SUPPER HERE
DON'T LEAVE ME FOR ONE
MINUTE TO NIGHT
O CAROLINE IT IS WELL YOU ARE GENTLE YOU WILL SAY TO ME GO AND I
SHALL GO COME AND I SHALL COME DO THIS AND I SHALL DO IT
YOU
INHERIT A CERTAIN MANNER AS WELL AS CERTAIN FEATURES
IT WILL ALWAYS BE
'MAMMA' PREFACING A MANDATE SOFTLY SPOKEN THOUGH FROM YOU THANK GOD
WELL SHE ADDED UNDER HER BREATH HE SPOKE SOFTLY TOO ONCE LIKE A
FLUTE BREATHING TENDERNESS AND THEN WHEN THE WORLD WAS NOT BY TO
LISTEN DISCORDS THAT SPLIT THE NERVES AND CURDLED THE BLOOD SOUNDS TO
INSPIRE INSANITY
IT SEEMS SO NATURAL MAMMA TO ASK YOU FOR THIS AND THAT
I SHALL WANT
NOBODY BUT YOU TO BE NEAR ME OR TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME
BUT DO NOT LET
ME BE TROUBLESOME
CHECK ME IF I ENCROACH
YOU MUST NOT DEPEND ON ME TO CHECK YOU YOU MUST KEEP GUARD OVER
YOURSELF
I HAVE LITTLE MORAL COURAGE THE WANT OF IT IS MY BANE
IT IS
THAT WHICH HAS MADE ME AN UNNATURAL PARENT WHICH HAS KEPT ME APART FROM
MY CHILD DURING THE TEN YEARS WHICH HAVE ELAPSED SINCE MY HUSBAND'S
DEATH LEFT ME AT LIBERTY TO CLAIM HER
IT WAS THAT WHICH FIRST UNNERVED
MY ARMS AND PERMITTED THE INFANT I MIGHT HAVE RETAINED A WHILE LONGER TO
BE SNATCHED PREMATURELY FROM THEIR EMBRACE
HOW MAMMA
I LET YOU GO AS A BABE BECAUSE YOU WERE PRETTY AND I FEARED YOUR
LOVELINESS DEEMING IT THE STAMP OF PERVERSITY
THEY SENT ME YOUR
PORTRAIT TAKEN AT EIGHT YEARS OLD THAT PORTRAIT CONFIRMED MY FEARS
HAD IT SHOWN ME A SUNBURNT LITTLE RUSTIC A HEAVY BLUNT FEATURED
COMMONPLACE CHILD I SHOULD HAVE HASTENED TO CLAIM YOU BUT THERE UNDER
THE SILVER PAPER I SAW BLOOMING THE DELICACY OF AN ARISTOCRATIC
FLOWER 'LITTLE LADY' WAS WRITTEN ON EVERY TRAIT
I HAD TOO RECENTLY
CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE YOKE OF THE FINE GENTLEMAN ESCAPED GALLED
CRUSHED PARALYZED DYING TO DARE TO ENCOUNTER HIS STILL FINER AND MOST
FAIRY LIKE REPRESENTATIVE
MY SWEET LITTLE LADY OVERWHELMED ME WITH
DISMAY HER AIR OF NATIVE ELEGANCE FROZE MY VERY MARROW
IN MY
EXPERIENCE I HAD NOT MET WITH TRUTH MODESTY GOOD PRINCIPLE AS THE
CONCOMITANTS OF BEAUTY
A FORM SO STRAIGHT AND FINE I ARGUED MUST
CONCEAL A MIND WARPED AND CRUEL
I HAD LITTLE FAITH IN THE POWER OF
EDUCATION TO RECTIFY SUCH A MIND OR RATHER I ENTIRELY MISDOUBTED MY
OWN ABILITY TO INFLUENCE IT
CAROLINE I DARED NOT UNDERTAKE TO REAR
YOU
I RESOLVED TO LEAVE YOU IN YOUR UNCLE'S HANDS
MATTHEWSON HELSTONE
I KNEW IF AN AUSTERE WAS AN UPRIGHT MAN
HE AND ALL THE WORLD THOUGHT
HARDLY OF ME FOR MY STRANGE UNMOTHERLY RESOLVE AND I DESERVED TO BE
MISJUDGED
MAMMA WHY DID YOU CALL YOURSELF MRS
PRYOR
IT WAS A NAME IN MY MOTHER'S FAMILY
I ADOPTED IT THAT I MIGHT LIVE
UNMOLESTED
MY MARRIED NAME RECALLED TOO VIVIDLY MY MARRIED LIFE I
COULD NOT BEAR IT
BESIDES THREATS WERE UTTERED OF FORCING ME TO RETURN
TO BONDAGE
IT COULD NOT BE
RATHER A BIER FOR A BED THE GRAVE FOR A
HOME
MY NEW NAME SHELTERED ME
I RESUMED UNDER ITS SCREEN MY OLD
OCCUPATION OF TEACHING
AT FIRST IT SCARCELY PROCURED ME THE MEANS OF
SUSTAINING LIFE BUT HOW SAVOURY WAS HUNGER WHEN I FASTED IN PEACE HOW
SAFE SEEMED THE DARKNESS AND CHILL OF AN UNKINDLED HEARTH WHEN NO LURID
REFLECTION FROM TERROR CRIMSONED ITS DESOLATION HOW SERENE WAS
SOLITUDE WHEN I FEARED NOT THE IRRUPTION OF VIOLENCE AND VICE
BUT MAMMA YOU HAVE BEEN IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD BEFORE
HOW DID IT
HAPPEN THAT WHEN YOU REAPPEARED HERE WITH MISS KEELDAR YOU WERE NOT
RECOGNIZED
I ONLY PAID A SHORT VISIT AS A BRIDE TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THEN I WAS
VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT I AM NOW SLENDER ALMOST AS SLENDER AS MY
DAUGHTER IS AT THIS DAY
MY COMPLEXION MY VERY FEATURES ARE CHANGED MY
HAIR MY STYLE OF DRESS EVERYTHING IS ALTERED
YOU CANNOT FANCY ME A
SLIM YOUNG PERSON ATTIRED IN SCANTY DRAPERY OF WHITE MUSLIN WITH BARE
ARMS BRACELETS AND NECKLACE OF BEADS AND HAIR DISPOSED IN ROUND
GRECIAN CURLS ABOVE MY FOREHEAD
YOU MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
MAMMA I HEARD THE FRONT DOOR
OPEN
IF IT IS MY UNCLE COMING IN JUST ASK HIM TO STEP UPSTAIRS AND
LET ME HEAR HIS ASSURANCE THAT I AM TRULY AWAKE AND COLLECTED AND NOT
DREAMING OR DELIRIOUS
THE RECTOR OF HIS OWN ACCORD WAS MOUNTING THE STAIRS AND MRS
PRYOR
SUMMONED HIM TO HIS NIECE'S APARTMENT
SHE'S NOT WORSE I HOPE HE INQUIRED HASTILY
I THINK HER BETTER
SHE IS DISPOSED TO CONVERSE SHE SEEMS STRONGER
GOOD SAID HE BRUSHING QUICKLY INTO THE ROOM HA CARY HOW DO DID
YOU DRINK MY CUP OF TEA I MADE IT FOR YOU JUST AS I LIKE IT MYSELF
I DRANK IT EVERY DROP UNCLE
IT DID ME GOOD IT HAS MADE ME QUITE
ALIVE
I HAVE A WISH FOR COMPANY SO I BEGGED MRS
PRYOR TO CALL YOU
IN
THE RESPECTED ECCLESIASTIC LOOKED PLEASED AND YET EMBARRASSED
HE WAS
WILLING ENOUGH TO BESTOW HIS COMPANY ON HIS SICK NIECE FOR TEN MINUTES
SINCE IT WAS HER WHIM TO WISH IT BUT WHAT MEANS TO EMPLOY FOR HER
ENTERTAINMENT HE KNEW NOT
HE HEMMED HE FIDGETED
YOU'LL BE UP IN A TRICE HE OBSERVED BY WAY OF SAYING SOMETHING
THE
LITTLE WEAKNESS WILL SOON PASS OFF AND THEN YOU MUST DRINK PORT WINE A
PIPE IF YOU CAN AND EAT GAME AND OYSTERS
I'LL GET THEM FOR YOU IF
THEY ARE TO BE HAD ANYWHERE
BLESS ME WE'LL MAKE YOU AS STRONG AS
SAMSON BEFORE WE'RE DONE WITH YOU
WHO IS THAT LADY UNCLE STANDING BESIDE YOU AT THE BED FOOT
GOOD GOD HE EJACULATED
SHE'S NOT WANDERING IS SHE MA'AM
MRS
PRYOR SMILED
I AM WANDERING IN A PLEASANT WORLD SAID CAROLINE IN A SOFT HAPPY
VOICE AND I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHETHER IT IS REAL OR VISIONARY
WHAT
LADY IS THAT GIVE HER A NAME UNCLE
WE MUST HAVE DR
RILE AGAIN MA'AM OR BETTER STILL MACTURK
HE'S LESS
OF A HUMBUG
THOMAS MUST SADDLE THE PONY AND GO FOR HIM
NO I DON'T WANT A DOCTOR
MAMMA SHALL BE MY ONLY PHYSICIAN
NOW DO
YOU UNDERSTAND UNCLE
MR
HELSTONE PUSHED UP HIS SPECTACLES FROM HIS NOSE TO HIS FOREHEAD
HANDLED HIS SNUFF BOX AND ADMINISTERED TO HIMSELF A PORTION OF THE
CONTENTS
THUS FORTIFIED HE ANSWERED BRIEFLY I SEE DAYLIGHT
YOU'VE
TOLD HER THEN MA'AM
AND IS IT TRUE DEMANDED CAROLINE RISING ON HER PILLOW
IS SHE
REALLY MY MOTHER
YOU WON'T CRY OR MAKE ANY SCENE OR TURN HYSTERICAL IF I ANSWER YES
CRY I'D CRY IF YOU SAID NO
IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE TO BE DISAPPOINTED
NOW
BUT GIVE HER A NAME
HOW DO YOU CALL HER
I CALL THIS STOUT LADY IN A QUAINT BLACK DRESS WHO LOOKS YOUNG ENOUGH
TO WEAR MUCH SMARTER RAIMENT IF SHE WOULD I CALL HER AGNES HELSTONE
SHE MARRIED MY BROTHER JAMES AND IS HIS WIDOW
AND MY MOTHER
WHAT A LITTLE SCEPTIC IT IS LOOK AT HER SMALL FACE MRS
PRYOR
SCARCELY LARGER THAN THE PALM OF MY HAND ALIVE WITH ACUTENESS AND
EAGERNESS TO CAROLINE SHE HAD THE TROUBLE OF BRINGING YOU INTO THE
WORLD AT ANY RATE
MIND YOU SHOW YOUR DUTY TO HER BY QUICKLY GETTING
WELL AND REPAIRING THE WASTE OF THESE CHEEKS HEIGH HO SHE USED TO BE
PLUMP
WHAT SHE HAS DONE WITH IT ALL I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME
DIVINE
IF WISHING TO GET WELL WILL HELP ME I SHALL NOT BE LONG SICK
THIS
MORNING I HAD NO REASON AND NO STRENGTH TO WISH IT
FANNY HERE TAPPED AT THE DOOR AND SAID THAT SUPPER WAS READY
UNCLE IF YOU PLEASE YOU MAY SEND ME A LITTLE BIT OF SUPPER ANYTHING
YOU LIKE FROM YOUR OWN PLATE
THAT IS WISER THAN GOING INTO HYSTERICS
IS IT NOT
IT IS SPOKEN LIKE A SAGE CARY
SEE IF I DON'T CATER FOR YOU
JUDICIOUSLY
WHEN WOMEN ARE SENSIBLE AND ABOVE ALL INTELLIGIBLE I
CAN GET ON WITH THEM
IT IS ONLY THE VAGUE SUPERFINE SENSATIONS AND
EXTREMELY WIRE DRAWN NOTIONS THAT PUT ME ABOUT
LET A WOMAN ASK ME TO
GIVE HER AN EDIBLE OR A WEARABLE BE THE SAME A ROC'S EGG OR THE
BREASTPLATE OF AARON A SHARE OF ST
JOHN'S LOCUSTS AND HONEY OR THE
LEATHERN GIRDLE ABOUT HIS LOINS I CAN AT LEAST UNDERSTAND THE DEMAND
BUT WHEN THEY PINE FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT SYMPATHY SENTIMENT SOME OF
THESE INDEFINITE ABSTRACTIONS I CAN'T DO IT I DON'T KNOW IT I HAVEN'T
GOT IT MADAM ACCEPT MY ARM
MRS
PRYOR SIGNIFIED THAT SHE SHOULD STAY WITH HER DAUGHTER THAT
EVENING
HELSTONE ACCORDINGLY LEFT THEM TOGETHER
HE SOON RETURNED
BRINGING A PLATE IN HIS OWN CONSECRATED HAND
THIS IS CHICKEN HE SAID BUT WE'LL HAVE PARTRIDGE TO MORROW LIFT
HER UP AND PUT A SHAWL OVER HER
ON MY WORD I UNDERSTAND
NURSING NOW HERE IS THE VERY SAME LITTLE SILVER FORK YOU USED WHEN
YOU FIRST CAME TO THE RECTORY
THAT STRIKES ME AS BEING WHAT YOU MAY
CALL A HAPPY THOUGHT A DELICATE ATTENTION
TAKE IT CARY AND MUNCH
AWAY CLEVERLY
CAROLINE DID HER BEST
HER UNCLE FROWNED TO SEE THAT HER POWERS WERE SO
LIMITED
HE PROPHESIED HOWEVER GREAT THINGS FOR THE FUTURE AND AS SHE
PRAISED THE MORSEL HE HAD BROUGHT AND SMILED GRATEFULLY IN HIS FACE HE
STOOPED OVER HER PILLOW KISSED HER AND SAID WITH A BROKEN RUGGED
ACCENT GOOD NIGHT BAIRNIE GOD BLESS THEE
CAROLINE ENJOYED SUCH PEACEFUL REST THAT NIGHT CIRCLED BY HER MOTHER'S
ARMS AND PILLOWED ON HER BREAST THAT SHE FORGOT TO WISH FOR ANY OTHER
STAY AND THOUGH MORE THAN ONE FEVERISH DREAM CAME TO HER IN SLUMBER
YET WHEN SHE WOKE UP PANTING SO HAPPY AND CONTENTED A FEELING RETURNED
WITH RETURNING CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HER AGITATION WAS SOOTHED ALMOST AS
SOON AS FELT
AS TO THE MOTHER SHE SPENT THE NIGHT LIKE JACOB AT PENIEL
TILL BREAK
OF DAY SHE WRESTLED WITH GOD IN EARNEST PRAYER
CHAPTER XXV
THE WEST WIND BLOWS
NOT ALWAYS DO THOSE WHO DARE SUCH DIVINE CONFLICT PREVAIL
NIGHT AFTER
NIGHT THE SWEAT OF AGONY MAY BURST DARK ON THE FOREHEAD THE SUPPLICANT
MAY CRY FOR MERCY WITH THAT SOUNDLESS VOICE THE SOUL UTTERS WHEN ITS
APPEAL IS TO THE INVISIBLE
SPARE MY BELOVED IT MAY IMPLORE
HEAL MY
LIFE'S LIFE
REND NOT FROM ME WHAT LONG AFFECTION ENTWINES WITH MY WHOLE
NATURE
GOD OF HEAVEN BEND HEAR BE CLEMENT AND AFTER THIS CRY AND
STRIFE THE SUN MAY RISE AND SEE HIM WORSTED
THAT OPENING MORN WHICH
USED TO SALUTE HIM WITH THE WHISPER OF ZEPHYRS THE CAROL OF SKYLARKS
MAY BREATHE AS ITS FIRST ACCENTS FROM THE DEAR LIPS WHICH COLOUR AND
HEAT HAVE QUITTED OH I HAVE HAD A SUFFERING NIGHT
THIS MORNING I AM
WORSE
I HAVE TRIED TO RISE
I CANNOT
DREAMS I AM UNUSED TO HAVE
TROUBLED ME
THEN THE WATCHER APPROACHES THE PATIENT'S PILLOW AND SEES A NEW AND
STRANGE MOULDING OF THE FAMILIAR FEATURES FEELS AT ONCE THAT THE
INSUFFERABLE MOMENT DRAWS NIGH KNOWS THAT IT IS GOD'S WILL HIS IDOL
SHALL BE BROKEN AND BENDS HIS HEAD AND SUBDUES HIS SOUL TO THE
SENTENCE HE CANNOT AVERT AND SCARCE CAN BEAR
HAPPY MRS
PRYOR SHE WAS STILL PRAYING UNCONSCIOUS THAT THE SUMMER SUN
HUNG ABOVE THE HILLS WHEN HER CHILD SOFTLY WOKE IN HER ARMS
NO
PITEOUS UNCONSCIOUS MOANING SOUND WHICH SO WASTES OUR STRENGTH THAT
EVEN IF WE HAVE SWORN TO BE FIRM A RUSH OF UNCONQUERABLE TEARS SWEEPS
AWAY THE OATH PRECEDED HER WAKING
NO SPACE OF DEAF APATHY FOLLOWED
THE FIRST WORDS SPOKEN WERE NOT THOSE OF ONE BECOMING ESTRANGED FROM
THIS WORLD AND ALREADY PERMITTED TO STRAY AT TIMES INTO REALMS FOREIGN
TO THE LIVING
CAROLINE EVIDENTLY REMEMBERED WITH CLEARNESS WHAT HAD
HAPPENED
MAMMA I HAVE SLEPT SO WELL
I ONLY DREAMED AND WOKE TWICE
MRS
PRYOR ROSE WITH A START THAT HER DAUGHTER MIGHT NOT SEE THE JOYFUL
TEARS CALLED INTO HER EYES BY THAT AFFECTIONATE WORD MAMMA AND THE
WELCOME ASSURANCE THAT FOLLOWED IT
FOR MANY DAYS THE MOTHER DARED REJOICE ONLY WITH TREMBLING
THAT FIRST
REVIVAL SEEMED LIKE THE FLICKER OF A DYING LAMP
IF THE FLAME STREAMED
UP BRIGHT ONE MOMENT THE NEXT IT SANK DIM IN THE SOCKET
EXHAUSTION
FOLLOWED CLOSE ON EXCITEMENT
THERE WAS ALWAYS A TOUCHING ENDEAVOUR TO APPEAR BETTER BUT TOO OFTEN
ABILITY REFUSED TO SECOND WILL TOO OFTEN THE ATTEMPT TO BEAR UP FAILED
THE EFFORT TO EAT TO TALK TO LOOK CHEERFUL WAS UNSUCCESSFUL
MANY AN
HOUR PASSED DURING WHICH MRS
PRYOR FEARED THAT THE CHORDS OF LIFE COULD
NEVER MORE BE STRENGTHENED THOUGH THE TIME OF THEIR BREAKING MIGHT BE
DEFERRED
DURING THIS SPACE THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER SEEMED LEFT ALMOST ALONE IN
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
IT WAS THE CLOSE OF AUGUST THE WEATHER WAS
FINE THAT IS TO SAY IT WAS VERY DRY AND VERY DUSTY FOR AN ARID WIND
HAD BEEN BLOWING FROM THE EAST THIS MONTH PAST VERY CLOUDLESS TOO
THOUGH A PALE HAZE STATIONARY IN THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TO ROB OF ALL
DEPTH OF TONE THE BLUE OF HEAVEN OF ALL FRESHNESS THE VERDURE OF EARTH
AND OF ALL GLOW THE LIGHT OF DAY
ALMOST EVERY FAMILY IN BRIARFIELD WAS
ABSENT ON AN EXCURSION
MISS KEELDAR AND HER FRIENDS WERE AT THE
SEASIDE SO WERE MRS
YORKE'S HOUSEHOLD
MR
HALL AND LOUIS MOORE
BETWEEN WHOM A SPONTANEOUS INTIMACY SEEMED TO HAVE ARISEN THE RESULT
PROBABLY OF HARMONY OF VIEWS AND TEMPERAMENT WERE GONE UP NORTH ON A
PEDESTRIAN EXCURSION TO THE LAKES
EVEN HORTENSE WHO WOULD FAIN HAVE
STAYED AT HOME AND AIDED MRS
PRYOR IN NURSING CAROLINE HAD BEEN SO
EARNESTLY ENTREATED BY MISS MANN TO ACCOMPANY HER ONCE MORE TO WORMWOOD
WELLS IN THE HOPE OF ALLEVIATING SUFFERINGS GREATLY AGGRAVATED BY THE
INSALUBRIOUS WEATHER THAT SHE FELT OBLIGED TO COMPLY INDEED IT WAS
NOT IN HER NATURE TO REFUSE A REQUEST THAT AT ONCE APPEALED TO HER
GOODNESS OF HEART AND BY A CONFESSION OF DEPENDENCY FLATTERED HER
AMOUR PROPRE
AS FOR ROBERT FROM BIRMINGHAM HE HAD GONE ON TO LONDON
WHERE HE STILL SOJOURNED
SO LONG AS THE BREATH OF ASIATIC DESERTS PARCHED CAROLINE'S LIPS AND
FEVERED HER VEINS HER PHYSICAL CONVALESCENCE COULD NOT KEEP PACE WITH
HER RETURNING MENTAL TRANQUILLITY BUT THERE CAME A DAY WHEN THE WIND
CEASED TO SOB AT THE EASTERN GABLE OF THE RECTORY AND AT THE ORIEL
WINDOW OF THE CHURCH
A LITTLE CLOUD LIKE A MAN'S HAND AROSE IN THE
WEST GUSTS FROM THE SAME QUARTER DROVE IT ON AND SPREAD IT WIDE WET
AND TEMPEST PREVAILED A WHILE
WHEN THAT WAS OVER THE SUN BROKE OUT
GENIALLY HEAVEN REGAINED ITS AZURE AND EARTH ITS GREEN THE LIVID
CHOLERA TINT HAD VANISHED FROM THE FACE OF NATURE THE HILLS ROSE CLEAR
ROUND THE HORIZON ABSOLVED FROM THAT PALE MALARIA HAZE
CAROLINE'S YOUTH COULD NOW BE OF SOME AVAIL TO HER AND SO COULD HER
MOTHER'S NURTURE
BOTH CROWNED BY GOD'S BLESSING SENT IN THE PURE WEST
WIND BLOWING SOFT AS FRESH THROUGH THE EVER OPEN CHAMBER LATTICE
REKINDLED HER LONG LANGUISHING ENERGIES
AT LAST MRS
PRYOR SAW THAT IT
WAS PERMITTED TO HOPE A GENUINE MATERIAL CONVALESCENCE HAD COMMENCED
IT WAS NOT MERELY CAROLINE'S SMILE WHICH WAS BRIGHTER OR HER SPIRITS
WHICH WERE CHEERED BUT A CERTAIN LOOK HAD PASSED FROM HER FACE AND
EYE A LOOK DREAD AND INDESCRIBABLE BUT WHICH WILL EASILY BE RECALLED
BY THOSE WHO HAVE WATCHED THE COUCH OF DANGEROUS DISEASE
LONG BEFORE
THE EMACIATED OUTLINES OF HER ASPECT BEGAN TO FILL OR ITS DEPARTED
COLOUR TO RETURN A MORE SUBTLE CHANGE TOOK PLACE ALL GREW SOFTER AND
WARMER
INSTEAD OF A MARBLE MASK AND GLASSY EYE MRS
PRYOR SAW LAID ON
THE PILLOW A FACE PALE AND WASTED ENOUGH PERHAPS MORE HAGGARD THAN THE
OTHER APPEARANCE BUT LESS AWFUL FOR IT WAS A SICK LIVING GIRL NOT A
MERE WHITE MOULD OR RIGID PIECE OF STATUARY
NOW TOO SHE WAS NOT ALWAYS PETITIONING TO DRINK
THE WORDS I AM SO
THIRSTY CEASED TO BE HER PLAINT
SOMETIMES WHEN SHE HAD SWALLOWED A
MORSEL SHE WOULD SAY IT HAD REVIVED HER
ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF FOOD WERE
NO LONGER EQUALLY DISTASTEFUL SHE COULD BE INDUCED SOMETIMES TO
INDICATE A PREFERENCE
WITH WHAT TREMBLING PLEASURE AND ANXIOUS CARE DID
NOT HER NURSE PREPARE WHAT WAS SELECTED HOW SHE WATCHED HER AS SHE
PARTOOK OF IT
NOURISHMENT BROUGHT STRENGTH
SHE COULD SIT UP
THEN SHE LONGED TO
BREATHE THE FRESH AIR TO REVISIT HER FLOWERS TO SEE HOW THE FRUIT HAD
RIPENED
HER UNCLE ALWAYS LIBERAL HAD BOUGHT A GARDEN CHAIR FOR HER
EXPRESS USE
HE CARRIED HER DOWN IN HIS OWN ARMS AND PLACED HER IN IT
HIMSELF AND WILLIAM FARREN WAS THERE TO WHEEL HER ROUND THE WALKS TO
SHOW HER WHAT HE HAD DONE AMONGST HER PLANTS TO TAKE HER DIRECTIONS FOR
FURTHER WORK
WILLIAM AND SHE FOUND PLENTY TO TALK ABOUT
THEY HAD A DOZEN TOPICS IN
COMMON INTERESTING TO THEM UNIMPORTANT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD
THEY
TOOK A SIMILAR INTEREST IN ANIMALS BIRDS INSECTS AND PLANTS THEY
HELD SIMILAR DOCTRINES ABOUT HUMANITY TO THE LOWER CREATION AND HAD A
SIMILAR TURN FOR MINUTE OBSERVATION ON POINTS OF NATURAL HISTORY
THE
NEST AND PROCEEDINGS OF SOME GROUND BEES WHICH HAD BURROWED IN THE TURF
UNDER AN OLD CHERRY TREE WAS ONE SUBJECT OF INTEREST THE HAUNTS OF
CERTAIN HEDGE SPARROWS AND THE WELFARE OF CERTAIN PEARLY EGGS AND
CALLOW FLEDGLINGS ANOTHER
HAD CHAMBERS'S JOURNAL EXISTED IN THOSE DAYS IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE
FORMED MISS HELSTONE'S AND FARREN'S FAVOURITE PERIODICAL
SHE WOULD HAVE
SUBSCRIBED FOR IT AND TO HIM EACH NUMBER WOULD DULY HAVE BEEN LENT
BOTH WOULD HAVE PUT IMPLICIT FAITH AND FOUND GREAT SAVOUR IN ITS
MARVELLOUS ANECDOTES OF ANIMAL SAGACITY
THIS IS A DIGRESSION BUT IT SUFFICES TO EXPLAIN WHY CAROLINE WOULD HAVE
NO OTHER HAND THAN WILLIAM'S TO GUIDE HER CHAIR AND WHY HIS SOCIETY AND
CONVERSATION SUFFICED TO GIVE INTEREST TO HER GARDEN AIRINGS
MRS
PRYOR WALKING NEAR WONDERED HOW HER DAUGHTER COULD BE SO MUCH AT
EASE WITH A MAN OF THE PEOPLE SHE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK TO
HIM OTHERWISE THAN STIFFLY
SHE FELT AS IF A GREAT GULF LAY BETWEEN HER
CASTE AND HIS AND THAT TO CROSS IT OR MEET HIM HALF WAY WOULD BE TO
DEGRADE HERSELF
SHE GENTLY ASKED CAROLINE ARE YOU NOT AFRAID MY
DEAR TO CONVERSE WITH THAT PERSON SO UNRESERVEDLY HE MAY PRESUME AND
BECOME TROUBLESOMELY GARRULOUS
WILLIAM PRESUME MAMMA YOU DON'T KNOW HIM
HE NEVER PRESUMES
HE IS
ALTOGETHER TOO PROUD AND SENSITIVE TO DO SO
WILLIAM HAS VERY FINE
FEELINGS
AND MRS
PRYOR SMILED SCEPTICALLY AT THE NAVE NOTION OF THAT
ROUGH HANDED ROUGH HEADED FUSTIAN CLAD CLOWN HAVING FINE FEELINGS
FARREN FOR HIS PART SHOWED MRS
PRYOR ONLY A VERY SULKY BROW
HE KNEW
WHEN HE WAS MISJUDGED AND WAS APT TO TURN UNMANAGEABLE WITH SUCH AS
FAILED TO GIVE HIM HIS DUE
THE EVENING RESTORED CAROLINE ENTIRELY TO HER MOTHER AND MRS
PRYOR
LIKED THE EVENING FOR THEN ALONE WITH HER DAUGHTER NO HUMAN SHADOW
CAME BETWEEN HER AND WHAT SHE LOVED
DURING THE DAY SHE WOULD HAVE HER
STIFF DEMEANOUR AND COOL MOMENTS AS WAS HER WONT
BETWEEN HER AND MR
HELSTONE A VERY RESPECTFUL BUT MOST RIGIDLY CEREMONIOUS INTERCOURSE WAS
KEPT UP
ANYTHING LIKE FAMILIARITY WOULD HAVE BRED CONTEMPT AT ONCE IN
ONE OR BOTH THESE PERSONAGES BUT BY DINT OF STRICT CIVILITY AND
WELL MAINTAINED DISTANCE THEY GOT ON VERY SMOOTHLY
TOWARDS THE SERVANTS MRS
PRYOR'S BEARING WAS NOT UNCOURTEOUS BUT SHY
FREEZING UNGENIAL
PERHAPS IT WAS DIFFIDENCE RATHER THAN PRIDE WHICH
MADE HER APPEAR SO HAUGHTY BUT AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED FANNY AND ELIZA
FAILED TO MAKE THE DISTINCTION AND SHE WAS UNPOPULAR WITH THEM
ACCORDINGLY
SHE FELT THE EFFECT PRODUCED IT RENDERED HER AT TIMES
DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF FOR FAULTS SHE COULD NOT HELP AND WITH ALL
ELSE DEJECTED CHILL AND TACITURN
THIS MOOD CHANGED TO CAROLINE'S INFLUENCE AND TO THAT INFLUENCE ALONE
THE DEPENDENT FONDNESS OF HER NURSLING THE NATURAL AFFECTION OF HER
CHILD CAME OVER HER SUAVELY
HER FROST FELL AWAY HER RIGIDITY UNBENT
SHE GREW SMILING AND PLIANT
NOT THAT CAROLINE MADE ANY WORDY PROFESSION
OF LOVE THAT WOULD ILL HAVE SUITED MRS
PRYOR SHE WOULD HAVE READ
THEREIN THE PROOF OF INSINCERITY BUT SHE HUNG ON HER WITH EASY
DEPENDENCE SHE CONFIDED IN HER WITH FEARLESS RELIANCE
THESE THINGS
CONTENTED THE MOTHER'S HEART
SHE LIKED TO HEAR HER DAUGHTER SAY MAMMA DO THIS PLEASE MAMMA
FETCH ME THAT MAMMA READ TO ME SING A LITTLE MAMMA
NOBODY ELSE NOT ONE LIVING THING HAD EVER SO CLAIMED HER SERVICES SO
LOOKED FOR HELP AT HER HAND
OTHER PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS
RESERVED AND STIFF WITH HER AS SHE WAS RESERVED AND STIFF WITH THEM
OTHER PEOPLE BETRAYED CONSCIOUSNESS OF AND ANNOYANCE AT HER WEAK POINTS
CAROLINE NO MORE SHOWED SUCH WOUNDING SAGACITY OR REPROACHFUL
SENSITIVENESS NOW THAN SHE HAD DONE WHEN A SUCKLING OF THREE MONTHS OLD
YET CAROLINE COULD FIND FAULT
BLIND TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEFECTS THAT
WERE INCURABLE SHE HAD HER EYES WIDE OPEN TO THE ACQUIRED HABITS THAT
WERE SUSCEPTIBLE OF REMEDY
ON CERTAIN POINTS SHE WOULD QUITE ARTLESSLY
LECTURE HER PARENT AND THAT PARENT INSTEAD OF BEING HURT FELT A
SENSATION OF PLEASURE IN DISCOVERING THAT THE GIRL DARED LECTURE HER
THAT SHE WAS SO MUCH AT HOME WITH HER
MAMMA I AM DETERMINED YOU SHALL NOT WEAR THAT OLD GOWN ANY MORE
ITS
FASHION IS NOT BECOMING IT IS TOO STRAIT IN THE SKIRT
YOU SHALL PUT ON
YOUR BLACK SILK EVERY AFTERNOON
IN THAT YOU LOOK NICE IT SUITS YOU
AND YOU SHALL HAVE A BLACK SATIN DRESS FOR SUNDAYS A REAL SATIN NOT A
SATINET OR ANY OF THE SHAMS
AND MAMMA WHEN YOU GET THE NEW ONE MIND
YOU MUST WEAR IT
MY DEAR I THOUGHT OF THE BLACK SILK SERVING ME AS A BEST DRESS FOR
MANY YEARS YET AND I WISHED TO BUY YOU SEVERAL THINGS
NONSENSE MAMMA
MY UNCLE GIVES ME CASH TO GET WHAT I WANT
YOU KNOW HE
IS GENEROUS ENOUGH AND I HAVE SET MY HEART ON SEEING YOU IN A BLACK
SATIN
GET IT SOON AND LET IT BE MADE BY A DRESSMAKER OF MY
RECOMMENDING
LET ME CHOOSE THE PATTERN
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO DISGUISE
YOURSELF LIKE A GRANDMOTHER
YOU WOULD PERSUADE ONE THAT YOU ARE OLD AND
UGLY

LADY'S MAID MYSELF
WHEN I GET A LITTLE STRONGER I WILL SET TO WORK AND
YOU MUST BE GOOD MAMMA AND DO AS I BID YOU
AND CAROLINE SITTING NEAR HER MOTHER REARRANGED HER MUSLIN
HANDKERCHIEF AND RESMOOTHED HER HAIR
MY OWN MAMMA THEN SHE WENT ON AS IF PLEASING HERSELF WITH THE
THOUGHT OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WHO BELONGS TO ME AND TO WHOM I BELONG
I AM A RICH GIRL NOW
I HAVE SOMETHING I CAN LOVE WELL AND NOT BE
AFRAID OF LOVING
MAMMA WHO GAVE YOU THIS LITTLE BROOCH LET ME UNPIN

HOW MISERABLE WE SHOULD BE MOTHER BEFORE I KNEW YOU I HAD AN
APPREHENSION THAT YOU WERE NOT GOOD THAT I COULD NOT ESTEEM YOU

COMPLIANCE IT WAS ONLY TO HEAR THEM REPEATED AND TO ENJOY HER CHILD'S
SOFT HALF PLAYFUL HALF PETULANT URGENCY
AND THEN WHEN SHE YIELDED
CAROLINE WOULD SAY ARCHLY YOU WILL SPOIL ME MAMMA
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I
SHOULD LIKE TO BE SPOILED AND I FIND IT VERY SWEET SO DID MRS
PRYOR
CHAPTER XXVI
OLD COPY BOOKS
BY THE TIME THE FIELDHEAD PARTY RETURNED TO BRIARFIELD CAROLINE WAS
NEARLY WELL
MISS KEELDAR WHO HAD RECEIVED NEWS BY POST OF HER FRIEND'S
CONVALESCENCE HARDLY SUFFERED AN HOUR TO ELAPSE BETWEEN HER ARRIVAL AT
HOME AND HER FIRST CALL AT THE RECTORY
A SHOWER OF RAIN WAS FALLING GENTLY YET FAST ON THE LATE FLOWERS AND
RUSSET AUTUMN SHRUBS WHEN THE GARDEN WICKET WAS HEARD TO SWING OPEN
AND SHIRLEY'S WELL KNOWN FORM PASSED THE WINDOW
ON HER ENTRANCE HER
FEELINGS WERE EVINCED IN HER OWN PECULIAR FASHION
WHEN DEEPLY MOVED BY
SERIOUS FEARS OR JOYS SHE WAS NOT GARRULOUS
THE STRONG EMOTION WAS
RARELY SUFFERED TO INFLUENCE HER TONGUE AND EVEN HER EYE REFUSED IT
MORE THAN A FURTIVE AND FITFUL CONQUEST
SHE TOOK CAROLINE IN HER ARMS
GAVE HER ONE LOOK ONE KISS THEN SAID YOU ARE BETTER
AND A MINUTE AFTER I SEE YOU ARE SAFE NOW BUT TAKE CARE
GOD GRANT
YOUR HEALTH MAY BE CALLED ON TO SUSTAIN NO MORE SHOCKS
SHE PROCEEDED TO TALK FLUENTLY ABOUT THE JOURNEY
IN THE MIDST OF
VIVACIOUS DISCOURSE HER EYE STILL WANDERED TO CAROLINE
THERE SPOKE IN
ITS LIGHT A DEEP SOLICITUDE SOME TROUBLE AND SOME AMAZE
SHE MAY BE BETTER IT SAID BUT HOW WEAK SHE STILL IS WHAT PERIL SHE
HAS COME THROUGH
SUDDENLY HER GLANCE REVERTED TO MRS
PRYOR
IT PIERCED HER THROUGH
WHEN WILL MY GOVERNESS RETURN TO ME SHE ASKED
MAY I TELL HER ALL DEMANDED CAROLINE OF HER MOTHER
LEAVE BEING
SIGNIFIED BY A GESTURE SHIRLEY WAS PRESENTLY ENLIGHTENED ON WHAT HAD
HAPPENED IN HER ABSENCE
VERY GOOD WAS THE COOL COMMENT VERY GOOD BUT IT IS NO NEWS TO ME
WHAT DID YOU KNOW
I GUESSED LONG SINCE THE WHOLE BUSINESS
I HAVE HEARD SOMEWHAT OF MRS
PRYOR'S HISTORY NOT FROM HERSELF BUT FROM OTHERS
WITH EVERY DETAIL OF
MR
JAMES HELSTONE'S CAREER AND CHARACTER I WAS ACQUAINTED
AN
AFTERNOON'S SITTING AND CONVERSATION WITH MISS MANN HAD RENDERED ME
FAMILIAR THEREWITH ALSO HE IS ONE OF MRS
YORKE'S WARNING EXAMPLES ONE
OF THE BLOOD RED LIGHTS SHE HANGS OUT TO SCARE YOUNG LADIES FROM
MATRIMONY
I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE TRUTH OF THE
PORTRAIT TRACED BY SUCH FINGERS BOTH THESE LADIES TAKE A DARK PLEASURE
IN OFFERING TO VIEW THE DARK SIDE OF LIFE BUT I QUESTIONED MR
YORKE ON
THE SUBJECT AND HE SAID 'SHIRLEY MY WOMAN IF YOU WANT TO KNOW AUGHT
ABOUT YOND' JAMES HELSTONE I CAN ONLY SAY HE WAS A MAN TIGER
HE WAS
HANDSOME DISSOLUTE SOFT TREACHEROUS COURTEOUS CRUEL DON'T CRY
CARY WE'LL SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
I AM NOT CRYING SHIRLEY OR IF I AM IT IS NOTHING
GO ON YOU ARE NO
FRIEND IF YOU WITHHOLD FROM ME THE TRUTH
I HATE THAT FALSE PLAN OF
DISGUISING MUTILATING THE TRUTH
FORTUNATELY I HAVE SAID PRETTY NEARLY ALL THAT I HAVE TO SAY EXCEPT
THAT YOUR UNCLE HIMSELF CONFIRMED MR
YORKE'S WORDS FOR HE TOO SCORNS A
LIE AND DEALS IN NONE OF THOSE CONVENTIONAL SUBTERFUGES THAT ARE
SHABBIER THAN LIES
BUT PAPA IS DEAD THEY SHOULD LET HIM ALONE NOW
THEY SHOULD AND WE WILL LET HIM ALONE
CRY AWAY CARY IT WILL DO
YOU GOOD
IT IS WRONG TO CHECK NATURAL TEARS
BESIDES I CHOOSE TO
PLEASE MYSELF BY SHARING AN IDEA THAT AT THIS MOMENT BEAMS IN YOUR
MOTHER'S EYE WHILE SHE LOOKS AT YOU
EVERY DROP BLOTS OUT A SIN
WEEP
YOUR TEARS HAVE THE VIRTUE WHICH THE RIVERS OF DAMASCUS LACKED
LIKE
JORDAN THEY CAN CLEANSE A LEPROUS MEMORY
MADAM SHE CONTINUED ADDRESSING MRS
PRYOR DID YOU THINK I COULD BE
DAILY IN THE HABIT OF SEEING YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER TOGETHER MARKING
YOUR MARVELLOUS SIMILARITY IN MANY POINTS OBSERVING PARDON ME YOUR
IRREPRESSIBLE EMOTIONS IN THE PRESENCE AND STILL MORE IN THE ABSENCE OF
YOUR CHILD AND NOT FORM MY OWN CONJECTURES I FORMED THEM AND THEY ARE
LITERALLY CORRECT
I SHALL BEGIN TO THINK MYSELF SHREWD
AND YOU SAID NOTHING OBSERVED CAROLINE WHO SOON REGAINED THE QUIET
CONTROL OF HER FEELINGS
NOTHING
I HAD NO WARRANT TO BREATHE A WORD ON THE SUBJECT
MY
BUSINESS IT WAS NOT I ABSTAINED FROM MAKING IT SUCH
YOU GUESSED SO DEEP A SECRET AND DID NOT HINT THAT YOU GUESSED IT
IS THAT SO DIFFICULT
IT IS NOT LIKE YOU
HOW DO YOU KNOW
YOU ARE NOT RESERVED YOU ARE FRANKLY COMMUNICATIVE
I MAY BE COMMUNICATIVE YET KNOW WHERE TO STOP
IN SHOWING MY TREASURE
I MAY WITHHOLD A GEM OR TWO A CURIOUS UNBOUGHT GRAVEN STONE AN AMULET
OF WHOSE MYSTIC GLITTER I RARELY PERMIT EVEN MYSELF A GLIMPSE
GOOD DAY
CAROLINE THUS SEEMED TO GET A VIEW OF SHIRLEY'S CHARACTER UNDER A NOVEL
ASPECT
ERE LONG THE PROSPECT WAS RENEWED IT OPENED UPON HER
NO SOONER HAD SHE REGAINED SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO BEAR A CHANGE OF
SCENE THE EXCITEMENT OF A LITTLE SOCIETY THAN MISS KEELDAR SUED DAILY
FOR HER PRESENCE AT FIELDHEAD
WHETHER SHIRLEY HAD BECOME WEARIED OF HER
HONOURED RELATIVES IS NOT KNOWN
SHE DID NOT SAY SHE WAS BUT SHE
CLAIMED AND RETAINED CAROLINE WITH AN EAGERNESS WHICH PROVED THAT AN
ADDITION TO THAT WORSHIPFUL COMPANY WAS NOT UNWELCOME
THE SYMPSONS WERE CHURCH PEOPLE
OF COURSE THE RECTOR'S NIECE WAS
RECEIVED BY THEM WITH COURTESY
MR
SYMPSON PROVED TO BE A MAN OF
SPOTLESS RESPECTABILITY WORRYING TEMPER PIOUS PRINCIPLES AND WORLDLY
VIEWS HIS LADY WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN PATIENT KIND WELL BRED
SHE HAD
BEEN BROUGHT UP ON A NARROW SYSTEM OF VIEWS STARVED ON A FEW
PREJUDICES A MERE HANDFUL OF BITTER HERBS A FEW PREFERENCES SOAKED
TILL THEIR NATURAL FLAVOUR WAS EXTRACTED AND WITH NO SEASONING ADDED IN
THE COOKING SOME EXCELLENT PRINCIPLES MADE UP IN A STIFF RAISED CRUST
OF BIGOTRY DIFFICULT TO DIGEST
FAR TOO SUBMISSIVE WAS SHE TO COMPLAIN
OF THIS DIET OR TO ASK FOR A CRUMB BEYOND IT
THE DAUGHTERS WERE AN EXAMPLE TO THEIR SEX
THEY WERE TALL WITH A ROMAN
NOSE APIECE
THEY HAD BEEN EDUCATED FAULTLESSLY
ALL THEY DID WAS WELL
DONE
HISTORY AND THE MOST SOLID BOOKS HAD CULTIVATED THEIR MINDS
PRINCIPLES AND OPINIONS THEY POSSESSED WHICH COULD NOT BE MENDED
MORE
EXACTLY REGULATED LIVES FEELINGS MANNERS HABITS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
DIFFICULT TO FIND ANYWHERE
THEY KNEW BY HEART A CERTAIN
YOUNG LADIES' SCHOOLROOM CODE OF LAWS ON LANGUAGE DEMEANOUR ETC
THEMSELVES NEVER DEVIATED FROM ITS CURIOUS LITTLE PRAGMATICAL
PROVISIONS AND THEY REGARDED WITH SECRET WHISPERED HORROR ALL
DEVIATIONS IN OTHERS
THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION WAS NO MYSTERY TO
THEM THEY HAD DISCOVERED THAT UNUTTERABLE THING IN THE CHARACTERISTIC
OTHERS CALL ORIGINALITY
QUICK WERE THEY TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF THIS
EVIL AND WHEREVER THEY SAW ITS TRACE WHETHER IN LOOK WORD OR DEED
WHETHER THEY READ IT IN THE FRESH VIGOROUS STYLE OF A BOOK OR LISTENED
TO IT IN INTERESTING UNHACKNEYED PURE EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE THEY
SHUDDERED THEY RECOILED
DANGER WAS ABOVE THEIR HEADS PERIL ABOUT
THEIR STEPS
WHAT WAS THIS STRANGE THING BEING UNINTELLIGIBLE IT MUST
BE BAD
LET IT BE DENOUNCED AND CHAINED UP
HENRY SYMPSON THE ONLY SON AND YOUNGEST CHILD OF THE FAMILY WAS A BOY
OF FIFTEEN
HE GENERALLY KEPT WITH HIS TUTOR
WHEN HE LEFT HIM HE
SOUGHT HIS COUSIN SHIRLEY
THIS BOY DIFFERED FROM HIS SISTERS
HE WAS
LITTLE LAME AND PALE HIS LARGE EYES SHONE SOMEWHAT LANGUIDLY IN A WAN
ORBIT
THEY WERE INDEED USUALLY RATHER DIM BUT THEY WERE CAPABLE OF
ILLUMINATION
AT TIMES THEY COULD NOT ONLY SHINE BUT BLAZE
INWARD
EMOTION COULD LIKEWISE GIVE COLOUR TO HIS CHEEK AND DECISION TO HIS
CRIPPLED MOVEMENTS
HENRY'S MOTHER LOVED HIM SHE THOUGHT HIS
PECULIARITIES WERE A MARK OF ELECTION
HE WAS NOT LIKE OTHER CHILDREN
SHE ALLOWED
SHE BELIEVED HIM REGENERATE A NEW SAMUEL CALLED OF GOD
FROM HIS BIRTH
HE WAS TO BE A CLERGYMAN
MR
AND THE MISSES SYMPSON
NOT UNDERSTANDING THE YOUTH LET HIM MUCH ALONE
SHIRLEY MADE HIM HER
PET AND HE MADE SHIRLEY HIS PLAYMATE
IN THE MIDST OF THIS FAMILY CIRCLE OR RATHER OUTSIDE IT MOVED THE
TUTOR THE SATELLITE
YES LOUIS MOORE WAS A SATELLITE OF THE HOUSE OF SYMPSON CONNECTED YET
APART EVER ATTENDANT EVER DISTANT
EACH MEMBER OF THAT CORRECT FAMILY
TREATED HIM WITH PROPER DIGNITY
THE FATHER WAS AUSTERELY CIVIL
SOMETIMES IRRITABLE THE MOTHER BEING A KIND WOMAN WAS ATTENTIVE BUT
FORMAL THE DAUGHTERS SAW IN HIM AN ABSTRACTION NOT A MAN
IT SEEMED
BY THEIR MANNER THAT THEIR BROTHER'S TUTOR DID NOT LIVE FOR THEM
THEY
WERE LEARNED SO WAS HE BUT NOT FOR THEM
THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHED HE
HAD TALENTS TOO IMPERCEPTIBLE TO THEIR SENSES
THE MOST SPIRITED SKETCH
FROM HIS FINGERS WAS A BLANK TO THEIR EYES THE MOST ORIGINAL
OBSERVATION FROM HIS LIPS FELL UNHEARD ON THEIR EARS
NOTHING COULD
EXCEED THE PROPRIETY OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR
I SHOULD HAVE SAID NOTHING COULD HAVE EQUALLED IT BUT I REMEMBER A FACT
WHICH STRANGELY ASTONISHED CAROLINE HELSTONE
IT WAS TO DISCOVER THAT
HER COUSIN HAD ABSOLUTELY NO SYMPATHIZING FRIEND AT FIELDHEAD THAT TO
MISS KEELDAR HE WAS AS MUCH A MERE TEACHER AS LITTLE A GENTLEMAN AS
LITTLE A MAN AS TO THE ESTIMABLE MISSES SYMPSON
WHAT HAD BEFALLEN THE KIND HEARTED SHIRLEY THAT SHE SHOULD BE SO
INDIFFERENT TO THE DREARY POSITION OF A FELLOW CREATURE THUS ISOLATED
UNDER HER ROOF SHE WAS NOT PERHAPS HAUGHTY TO HIM BUT SHE NEVER
NOTICED HIM SHE LET HIM ALONE
HE CAME AND WENT SPOKE OR WAS SILENT
AND SHE RARELY RECOGNIZED HIS EXISTENCE
AS TO LOUIS MOORE HIMSELF HE HAD THE AIR OF A MAN USED TO THIS LIFE
AND WHO HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO BEAR IT FOR A TIME
HIS FACULTIES SEEMED
WALLED UP IN HIM AND WERE UNMURMURING IN THEIR CAPTIVITY
HE NEVER
LAUGHED HE SELDOM SMILED HE WAS UNCOMPLAINING
HE FULFILLED THE ROUND
OF HIS DUTIES SCRUPULOUSLY
HIS PUPIL LOVED HIM HE ASKED NOTHING MORE
THAN CIVILITY FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
IT EVEN APPEARED THAT HE WOULD
ACCEPT NOTHING MORE IN THAT ABODE AT LEAST FOR WHEN HIS COUSIN
CAROLINE MADE GENTLE OVERTURES OF FRIENDSHIP HE DID NOT ENCOURAGE
THEM HE RATHER AVOIDED THAN SOUGHT HER
ONE LIVING THING ALONE BESIDES
HIS PALE CRIPPLED SCHOLAR HE FONDLED IN THE HOUSE AND THAT WAS THE
RUFFIANLY TARTAR WHO SULLEN AND IMPRACTICABLE TO OTHERS ACQUIRED A
SINGULAR PARTIALITY FOR HIM A PARTIALITY SO MARKED THAT SOMETIMES WHEN
MOORE SUMMONED TO A MEAL ENTERED THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN UNWELCOMED
TARTAR WOULD RISE FROM HIS LAIR AT SHIRLEY'S FEET AND BETAKE HIMSELF TO
THE TACITURN TUTOR
ONCE BUT ONCE SHE NOTICED THE DESERTION AND
HOLDING OUT HER WHITE HAND AND SPEAKING SOFTLY TRIED TO COAX HIM BACK
TARTAR LOOKED SLAVERED AND SIGHED AS HIS MANNER WAS BUT YET
DISREGARDED THE INVITATION AND COOLLY SETTLED HIMSELF ON HIS HAUNCHES
AT LOUIS MOORE'S SIDE
THAT GENTLEMAN DREW THE DOG'S BIG BLACK MUZZLED
HEAD ON TO HIS KNEE PATTED HIM AND SMILED ONE LITTLE SMILE TO HIMSELF
AN ACUTE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE REMARKED IN THE COURSE OF THE SAME
EVENING THAT AFTER TARTAR HAD RESUMED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO SHIRLEY AND
WAS ONCE MORE COUCHED NEAR HER FOOTSTOOL THE AUDACIOUS TUTOR BY ONE
WORD AND GESTURE FASCINATED HIM AGAIN
HE PRICKED UP HIS EARS AT THE
WORD HE STARTED ERECT AT THE GESTURE AND CAME WITH HEAD LOVINGLY
DEPRESSED TO RECEIVE THE EXPECTED CARESS
AS IT WAS GIVEN THE
SIGNIFICANT SMILE AGAIN RIPPLED ACROSS MOORE'S QUIET FACE
SHIRLEY SAID CAROLINE ONE DAY AS THEY TWO WERE SITTING ALONE IN THE
SUMMER HOUSE DID YOU KNOW THAT MY COUSIN LOUIS WAS TUTOR IN YOUR
UNCLE'S FAMILY BEFORE THE SYMPSONS CAME DOWN HERE
SHIRLEY'S REPLY WAS NOT SO PROMPT AS HER RESPONSES USUALLY WERE BUT AT
LAST SHE ANSWERED YES OF COURSE I KNEW IT WELL
I THOUGHT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE
WELL WHAT THEN
IT PUZZLES ME TO GUESS HOW IT CHANCED THAT YOU NEVER MENTIONED IT TO
ME
WHY SHOULD IT PUZZLE YOU
IT SEEMS ODD
I CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR IT
YOU TALK A GREAT DEAL YOU TALK
FREELY
HOW WAS THAT CIRCUMSTANCE NEVER TOUCHED ON
BECAUSE IT NEVER WAS AND SHIRLEY LAUGHED
YOU ARE A SINGULAR BEING OBSERVED HER FRIEND
I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU
QUITE WELL I BEGIN TO FIND MYSELF MISTAKEN
YOU WERE SILENT AS THE
GRAVE ABOUT MRS
PRYOR AND NOW AGAIN HERE IS ANOTHER SECRET
BUT WHY
YOU MADE IT A SECRET IS THE MYSTERY TO ME
I NEVER MADE IT A SECRET I HAD NO REASON FOR SO DOING
IF YOU HAD
ASKED ME WHO HENRY'S TUTOR WAS I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
BESIDES I
THOUGHT YOU KNEW
I AM PUZZLED ABOUT MORE THINGS THAN ONE IN THIS MATTER
YOU DON'T LIKE
POOR LOUIS
WHY ARE YOU IMPATIENT AT WHAT YOU PERHAPS CONSIDER HIS
SERVILE POSITION DO YOU WISH THAT ROBERT'S BROTHER WERE MORE HIGHLY
PLACED
ROBERT'S BROTHER INDEED WAS THE EXCLAMATION UTTERED IN A TONE LIKE
THE ACCENTS OF SCORN AND WITH A MOVEMENT OF PROUD IMPATIENCE SHIRLEY
SNATCHED A ROSE FROM A BRANCH PEEPING THROUGH THE OPEN LATTICE
YES REPEATED CAROLINE WITH MILD FIRMNESS ROBERT'S BROTHER
HE IS
THUS CLOSELY RELATED TO GRARD MOORE OF THE HOLLOW THOUGH NATURE HAS
NOT GIVEN HIM FEATURES SO HANDSOME OR AN AIR SO NOBLE AS HIS KINSMAN
BUT HIS BLOOD IS AS GOOD AND HE IS AS MUCH A GENTLEMAN WERE HE FREE
WISE HUMBLE PIOUS CAROLINE EXCLAIMED SHIRLEY IRONICALLY
MEN AND
ANGELS HEAR HER WE SHOULD NOT DESPISE PLAIN FEATURES NOR A LABORIOUS
YET HONEST OCCUPATION SHOULD WE LOOK AT THE SUBJECT OF YOUR PANEGYRIC
HE IS THERE IN THE GARDEN SHE CONTINUED POINTING THROUGH AN APERTURE
IN THE CLUSTERING CREEPERS AND BY THAT APERTURE LOUIS MOORE WAS
VISIBLE COMING SLOWLY DOWN THE WALK
HE IS NOT UGLY SHIRLEY PLEADED CAROLINE HE IS NOT IGNOBLE
HE IS
SAD SILENCE SEALS HIS MIND
BUT I BELIEVE HIM TO BE INTELLIGENT AND BE
CERTAIN IF HE HAD NOT SOMETHING VERY COMMENDABLE IN HIS DISPOSITION
MR
HALL WOULD NEVER SEEK HIS SOCIETY AS HE DOES
SHIRLEY LAUGHED SHE LAUGHED AGAIN EACH TIME WITH A SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
SOUND
WELL WELL WAS HER COMMENT
ON THE PLEA OF THE MAN BEING
CYRIL HALL'S FRIEND AND ROBERT MOORE'S BROTHER WE'LL JUST TOLERATE HIS
EXISTENCE WON'T WE CARY YOU BELIEVE HIM TO BE INTELLIGENT DO YOU
NOT QUITE AN IDIOT EH SOMETHING COMMENDABLE IN HIS DISPOSITION ID
EST NOT AN ABSOLUTE RUFFIAN
GOOD YOUR REPRESENTATIONS HAVE WEIGHT
WITH ME AND TO PROVE THAT THEY HAVE SHOULD HE COME THIS WAY I WILL
SPEAK TO HIM
HE APPROACHED THE SUMMER HOUSE
UNCONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS TENANTED HE SAT
DOWN ON THE STEP
TARTAR NOW HIS CUSTOMARY COMPANION HAD FOLLOWED HIM
AND HE COUCHED ACROSS HIS FEET
OLD BOY SAID LOUIS PULLING HIS TAWNY EAR OR RATHER THE MUTILATED
REMAINS OF THAT ORGAN TORN AND CHEWED IN A HUNDRED BATTLES THE AUTUMN
SUN SHINES AS PLEASANTLY ON US AS ON THE FAIREST AND RICHEST
THIS
GARDEN IS NONE OF OURS BUT WE ENJOY ITS GREENNESS AND PERFUME DON'T
WE
HE SAT SILENT STILL CARESSING TARTAR WHO SLOBBERED WITH EXCEEDING
AFFECTION
A FAINT TWITTERING COMMENCED AMONG THE TREES ROUND
SOMETHING
FLUTTERED DOWN AS LIGHT AS LEAVES
THEY WERE LITTLE BIRDS WHICH
LIGHTING ON THE SWARD AT SHY DISTANCE HOPPED AS IF EXPECTANT
THE SMALL BROWN ELVES ACTUALLY REMEMBER THAT I FED THEM THE OTHER DAY
AGAIN SOLILOQUIZED LOUIS
THEY WANT SOME MORE BISCUIT
TO DAY I FORGOT
TO SAVE A FRAGMENT
EAGER LITTLE SPRITES I HAVE NOT A CRUMB FOR YOU
HE PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND DREW IT OUT EMPTY
A WANT EASILY SUPPLIED WHISPERED THE LISTENING MISS KEELDAR
SHE TOOK FROM HER RETICULE A MORSEL OF SWEET CAKE FOR THAT REPOSITORY
WAS NEVER DESTITUTE OF SOMETHING AVAILABLE TO THROW TO THE CHICKENS
YOUNG DUCKS OR SPARROWS
SHE CRUMBLED IT AND BENDING OVER HIS
SHOULDER PUT THE CRUMBS INTO HIS HAND
THERE SAID SHE THERE IS A PROVIDENCE FOR THE IMPROVIDENT
THIS SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON IS PLEASANT OBSERVED LOUIS MOORE AS NOT AT
ALL DISCOMPOSED HE CALMLY CAST THE CRUMBS ON TO THE GRASS
EVEN FOR YOU
AS PLEASANT FOR ME AS FOR ANY MONARCH
YOU TAKE A SORT OF HARSH SOLITARY TRIUMPH IN DRAWING PLEASURE OUT OF
THE ELEMENTS AND THE INANIMATE AND LOWER ANIMATE CREATION
SOLITARY BUT NOT HARSH
WITH ANIMALS I FEEL I AM ADAM'S SON THE HEIR
OF HIM TO WHOM DOMINION WAS GIVEN OVER 'EVERY LIVING THING THAT MOVETH
UPON THE EARTH YOUR DOG LIKES AND FOLLOWS ME
WHEN I GO INTO THAT
YARD THE PIGEONS FROM YOUR DOVECOT FLUTTER AT MY FEET
YOUR MARE IN THE
STABLE KNOWS ME AS WELL AS IT KNOWS YOU AND OBEYS ME BETTER
AND MY ROSES SMELL SWEET TO YOU AND MY TREES GIVE YOU SHADE
AND CONTINUED LOUIS NO CAPRICE CAN WITHDRAW THESE PLEASURES FROM
ME THEY ARE MINE
HE WALKED OFF
TARTAR FOLLOWED HIM AS IF IN DUTY AND AFFECTION BOUND
AND SHIRLEY REMAINED STANDING ON THE SUMMER HOUSE STEP
CAROLINE SAW HER
FACE AS SHE LOOKED AFTER THE RUDE TUTOR
IT WAS PALE AS IF HER PRIDE
BLED INWARDLY
YOU SEE REMARKED CAROLINE APOLOGETICALLY HIS FEELINGS ARE SO OFTEN
HURT IT MAKES HIM MOROSE
YOU SEE RETORTED SHIRLEY WITH IRE HE IS A TOPIC ON WHICH YOU AND I
SHALL QUARREL IF WE DISCUSS IT OFTEN SO DROP IT HENCEFORWARD AND FOR
EVER
I SUPPOSE HE HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEHAVED IN THIS WAY THOUGHT CAROLINE
TO HERSELF AND THAT RENDERS SHIRLEY SO DISTANT TO HIM
YET I WONDER
SHE CANNOT MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES
I WONDER THE
GENERAL MODESTY MANLINESS SINCERITY OF HIS NATURE DO NOT PLEAD WITH
HER IN HIS BEHALF
SHE IS NOT OFTEN SO INCONSIDERATE SO IRRITABLE
THE VERBAL TESTIMONY OF TWO FRIENDS OF CAROLINE'S TO HER COUSIN'S
CHARACTER AUGMENTED HER FAVOURABLE OPINION OF HIM
WILLIAM FARREN WHOSE
COTTAGE HE HAD VISITED IN COMPANY WITH MR
HALL PRONOUNCED HIM A REAL
GENTLEMAN THERE WAS NOT SUCH ANOTHER IN BRIARFIELD
HE WILLIAM COULD DO AUGHT FOR THAT MAN
AND THEN TO SEE HOW T' BAIRNS
LIKED HIM AND HOW T' WIFE TOOK TO HIM FIRST MINUTE SHE SAW HIM
HE
NEVER WENT INTO A HOUSE BUT T' CHILDER WOR ABOUT HIM DIRECTLY
THEM
LITTLE THINGS WOR LIKE AS IF THEY'D A KEENER SENSE NOR GROWN UP FOLKS I'
FINDING OUR FOLK'S NATURES
MR
HALL IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION OF MISS HELSTONE'S AS TO WHAT HE
THOUGHT OF LOUIS MOORE REPLIED PROMPTLY THAT HE WAS THE BEST FELLOW HE
HAD MET WITH SINCE HE LEFT CAMBRIDGE
BUT HE IS SO GRAVE OBJECTED CAROLINE
GRAVE THE FINEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD FULL OF ODD QUIET
OUT OF THE WAY HUMOUR
NEVER ENJOYED AN EXCURSION SO MUCH IN MY LIFE AS
THE ONE I TOOK WITH HIM TO THE LAKES
HIS UNDERSTANDING AND TASTES ARE
SO SUPERIOR IT DOES A MAN GOOD TO BE WITHIN THEIR INFLUENCE AND AS TO
HIS TEMPER AND NATURE I CALL THEM FINE
AT FIELDHEAD HE LOOKS GLOOMY AND I BELIEVE HAS THE CHARACTER OF
BEING MISANTHROPICAL
OH I FANCY HE IS RATHER OUT OF PLACE THERE IN A FALSE POSITION
THE
SYMPSONS ARE MOST ESTIMABLE PEOPLE BUT NOT THE FOLKS TO COMPREHEND HIM
THEY THINK A GREAT DEAL ABOUT FORM AND CEREMONY WHICH ARE QUITE OUT OF
LOUIS'S WAY
I DON'T THINK MISS KEELDAR LIKES HIM
SHE DOESN'T KNOW HIM SHE DOESN'T KNOW HIM OTHERWISE SHE HAS SENSE
ENOUGH TO DO JUSTICE TO HIS MERITS
WELL I SUPPOSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW HIM MUSED CAROLINE TO HERSELF AND
BY THIS HYPOTHESIS SHE ENDEAVOURED TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT SEEMED ELSE
UNACCOUNTABLE
BUT SUCH SIMPLE SOLUTION OF THE DIFFICULTY WAS NOT LEFT
HER LONG
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO REFUSE MISS KEELDAR EVEN THIS NEGATIVE
EXCUSE FOR HER PREJUDICE
ONE DAY SHE CHANCED TO BE IN THE SCHOOLROOM WITH HENRY SYMPSON WHOSE
AMIABLE AND AFFECTIONATE DISPOSITION HAD QUICKLY RECOMMENDED HIM TO HER
REGARD
THE BOY WAS BUSIED ABOUT SOME MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCE HIS
LAMENESS MADE HIM FOND OF SEDENTARY OCCUPATION
HE BEGAN TO RANSACK HIS
TUTOR'S DESK FOR A PIECE OF WAX OR TWINE NECESSARY TO HIS WORK
MOORE
HAPPENED TO BE ABSENT
MR
HALL INDEED HAD CALLED FOR HIM TO TAKE A
LONG WALK
HENRY COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY FIND THE OBJECT OF HIS SEARCH
HE
RUMMAGED COMPARTMENT AFTER COMPARTMENT AND AT LAST OPENING AN INNER
DRAWER HE CAME UPON NOT A BALL OF CORD OR A LUMP OF BEESWAX BUT A
LITTLE BUNDLE OF SMALL MARBLE COLOURED CAHIERS TIED WITH TAPE
HENRY
LOOKED AT THEM
WHAT RUBBISH MR
MOORE STORES UP IN HIS DESK HE
SAID
I HOPE HE WON'T KEEP MY OLD EXERCISES SO CAREFULLY
WHAT IS IT
OLD COPY BOOKS
HE THREW THE BUNDLE TO CAROLINE
THE PACKET LOOKED SO NEAT EXTERNALLY
HER CURIOSITY WAS EXCITED TO SEE ITS CONTENTS
IF THEY ARE ONLY COPY BOOKS I SUPPOSE I MAY OPEN THEM
OH YES QUITE FREELY
MR
MOORE'S DESK IS HALF MINE FOR HE LETS ME
KEEP ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN IT AND I GIVE YOU LEAVE
ON SCRUTINY THEY PROVED TO BE FRENCH COMPOSITIONS WRITTEN IN A HAND
PECULIAR BUT COMPACT AND EXQUISITELY CLEAN AND CLEAR
THE WRITING WAS
RECOGNIZABLE
SHE SCARCELY NEEDED THE FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE NAME
SIGNED AT THE CLOSE OF EACH THEME TO TELL HER WHOSE THEY WERE
YET THAT
NAME ASTONISHED HER SHIRLEY KEELDAR SYMPSON GROVE SHIRE A
SOUTHERN COUNTY AND A DATE FOUR YEARS BACK
SHE TIED UP THE PACKET AND HELD IT IN HER HAND MEDITATING OVER IT
SHE
HALF FELT AS IF IN OPENING IT SHE HAD VIOLATED A CONFIDENCE
THEY ARE SHIRLEY'S YOU SEE SAID HENRY CARELESSLY
DID YOU GIVE THEM TO MR
MOORE SHE WROTE THEM WITH MRS
PRYOR I
SUPPOSE
SHE WROTE THEM IN MY SCHOOLROOM AT SYMPSON GROVE WHEN SHE LIVED WITH
US THERE
MR
MOORE TAUGHT HER FRENCH IT IS HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE
I KNOW
WAS SHE A GOOD PUPIL HENRY
SHE WAS A WILD LAUGHING THING BUT PLEASANT TO HAVE IN THE ROOM
SHE
MADE LESSON TIME CHARMING
SHE LEARNED FAST YOU COULD HARDLY TELL WHEN
OR HOW
FRENCH WAS NOTHING TO HER
SHE SPOKE IT QUICK QUICK AS QUICK
AS MR
MOORE HIMSELF
WAS SHE OBEDIENT DID SHE GIVE TROUBLE
SHE GAVE PLENTY OF TROUBLE IN A WAY
SHE WAS GIDDY BUT I LIKED HER
I'M DESPERATELY FOND OF SHIRLEY
DESPERATELY FOND YOU SMALL SIMPLETON YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAY
I AM DESPERATELY FOND OF HER
SHE IS THE LIGHT OF MY EYES
I SAID SO
TO MR
MOORE LAST NIGHT
HE WOULD REPROVE YOU FOR SPEAKING WITH EXAGGERATION
HE DIDN'T
HE NEVER REPROVES AND REPROVES AS GIRLS' GOVERNESSES DO
HE
WAS READING AND HE ONLY SMILED INTO HIS BOOK AND SAID THAT IF MISS
KEELDAR WAS NO MORE THAN THAT SHE WAS LESS THAN HE TOOK HER TO BE FOR
I WAS BUT A DIM EYED SHORT SIGHTED LITTLE CHAP
I'M AFRAID I AM A POOR
UNFORTUNATE MISS CAROLINE HELSTONE
I AM A CRIPPLE YOU KNOW
NEVER MIND HENRY YOU ARE A VERY NICE LITTLE FELLOW AND IF GOD HAS
NOT GIVEN YOU HEALTH AND STRENGTH HE HAS GIVEN YOU A GOOD DISPOSITION
AND AN EXCELLENT HEART AND BRAIN
I SHALL BE DESPISED
I SOMETIMES THINK BOTH SHIRLEY AND YOU DESPISE
ME
LISTEN HENRY
GENERALLY I DON'T LIKE SCHOOLBOYS
I HAVE A GREAT
HORROR OF THEM
THEY SEEM TO ME LITTLE RUFFIANS WHO TAKE AN UNNATURAL
DELIGHT IN KILLING AND TORMENTING BIRDS AND INSECTS AND KITTENS AND
WHATEVER IS WEAKER THAN THEMSELVES
BUT YOU ARE SO DIFFERENT I AM QUITE
FOND OF YOU
YOU HAVE ALMOST AS MUCH SENSE AS A MAN FAR MORE GOD WOT
SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF THAN MANY MEN YOU ARE FOND OF READING AND
YOU CAN TALK SENSIBLY ABOUT WHAT YOU READ
I AM FOND OF READING
I KNOW I HAVE SENSE AND I KNOW I HAVE
FEELING
MISS KEELDAR HERE ENTERED
HENRY SHE SAID I HAVE BROUGHT YOUR LUNCH HERE
I SHALL PREPARE IT
FOR YOU MYSELF
SHE PLACED ON THE TABLE A GLASS OF NEW MILK A PLATE OF SOMETHING WHICH
LOOKED NOT UNLIKE LEATHER AND A UTENSIL WHICH RESEMBLED A
TOASTING FORK
WHAT ARE YOU TWO ABOUT SHE CONTINUED RANSACKING MR
MOORE'S DESK
LOOKING AT YOUR OLD COPY BOOKS RETURNED CAROLINE
MY OLD COPY BOOKS
FRENCH EXERCISE BOOKS
LOOK HERE THEY MUST BE HELD PRECIOUS THEY ARE
KEPT CAREFULLY
SHE SHOWED THE BUNDLE
SHIRLEY SNATCHED IT UP
DID NOT KNOW ONE WAS IN
EXISTENCE SHE SAID
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE LOT HAD LONG SINCE LIT THE
KITCHEN FIRE OR CURLED THE MAID'S HAIR AT SYMPSON GROVE WHAT MADE YOU
KEEP THEM HENRY
IT IS NOT MY DOING
I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF IT
IT NEVER ENTERED
MY HEAD TO SUPPOSE COPY BOOKS OF VALUE
MR
MOORE PUT THEM BY IN THE
INNER DRAWER OF HIS DESK
PERHAPS HE FORGOT THEM

STANDING BEHIND HIM HOLDING THE CANDLE AND WATCHING HIM DRAW THE SNOWY
CLIFF THE PINE THE DEER COUCHED UNDER IT AND THE HALF MOON HUNG
ABOVE

THE YOUNG CRIPPLE ROSE AND LIMPED TOWARDS THE FIRE HE HAD LEFT HIS
CRUTCH NEAR THE MANTELPIECE

HERE HAL HERE IS YOUR TOASTED OATCAKE EAT AND LIVE
WILLINGLY HERE CRIED A VOICE OUTSIDE THE OPEN WINDOW
I KNOW THAT
FRAGRANCE OF MEAL BREAD
MISS KEELDAR MAY I COME IN AND PARTAKE
MR
HALL IT WAS MR
HALL AND WITH HIM WAS LOUIS MOORE RETURNED FROM
THEIR WALK THERE IS A PROPER LUNCHEON LAID OUT IN THE DINING ROOM AND
THERE ARE PROPER PEOPLE SEATED ROUND IT
YOU MAY JOIN THAT SOCIETY AND
SHARE THAT FARE IF YOU PLEASE BUT IF YOUR ILL REGULATED TASTES LEAD YOU
TO PREFER ILL REGULATED PROCEEDINGS STEP IN HERE AND DO AS WE DO
I APPROVE THE PERFUME AND THEREFORE SHALL SUFFER MYSELF TO BE LED BY
THE NOSE RETURNED MR
HALL WHO PRESENTLY ENTERED ACCOMPANIED BY
LOUIS MOORE
THAT GENTLEMAN'S EYE FELL ON HIS DESK PILLAGED
BURGLARS SAID HE HENRY YOU MERIT THE FERULE
GIVE IT TO SHIRLEY AND CAROLINE THEY DID IT WAS ALLEGED WITH MORE
ATTENTION TO EFFECT THAN TRUTH
TRAITOR AND FALSE WITNESS CRIED BOTH THE GIRLS
WE NEVER LAID HANDS
ON A THING EXCEPT IN THE SPIRIT OF LAUDABLE INQUIRY
EXACTLY SO SAID MOORE WITH HIS RARE SMILE
AND WHAT HAVE YOU
FERRETED OUT IN YOUR 'SPIRIT OF LAUDABLE INQUIRY'
HE PERCEIVED THE INNER DRAWER OPEN
THIS IS EMPTY SAID HE
WHO HAS TAKEN
HERE HERE CAROLINE HASTENED TO SAY AND SHE RESTORED THE LITTLE
PACKET TO ITS PLACE
HE SHUT IT UP HE LOCKED IT IN WITH A SMALL KEY
ATTACHED TO HIS WATCH GUARD HE RESTORED THE OTHER PAPERS TO ORDER
CLOSED THE REPOSITORY AND SAT DOWN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE SCOLDED MUCH MORE SIR SAID HENRY
THE
GIRLS DESERVE REPRIMAND
I LEAVE THEM TO THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
IT ACCUSES THEM OF CRIMES INTENDED AS WELL AS PERPETRATED SIR
IF I
HAD NOT BEEN HERE THEY WOULD HAVE TREATED YOUR PORTFOLIO AS THEY HAVE
DONE YOUR DESK BUT I TOLD THEM IT WAS PADLOCKED
AND WILL YOU HAVE LUNCH WITH US HERE INTERPOSED SHIRLEY ADDRESSING
MOORE AND DESIROUS AS IT SEEMED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION
CERTAINLY IF I MAY
YOU WILL BE RESTRICTED TO NEW MILK AND YORKSHIRE OATCAKE
VA POUR LE LAIT FRAIS SAID LOUIS
BUT FOR YOUR OATCAKE AND HE
MADE A GRIMACE
HE CANNOT EAT IT SAID HENRY
HE THINKS IT IS LIKE BRAN RAISED WITH
SOUR YEAST
COME THEN BY SPECIAL DISPENSATION WE WILL ALLOW HIM A FEW CRACKNELS
BUT NOTHING LESS HOMELY
THE HOSTESS RANG THE BELL AND GAVE HER FRUGAL ORDERS WHICH WERE
PRESENTLY EXECUTED
SHE HERSELF MEASURED OUT THE MILK AND DISTRIBUTED
THE BREAD ROUND THE COSY CIRCLE NOW ENCLOSING THE BRIGHT LITTLE
SCHOOLROOM FIRE
SHE THEN TOOK THE POST OF TOASTER GENERAL AND KNEELING
ON THE RUG FORK IN HAND FULFILLED HER OFFICE WITH DEXTERITY
MR
HALL
WHO RELISHED ANY HOMELY INNOVATION ON ORDINARY USAGES AND TO WHOM THE
HUSKY OATCAKE WAS FROM CUSTOM SUAVE AS MANNA SEEMED IN HIS BEST
SPIRITS
HE TALKED AND LAUGHED GLEEFULLY NOW WITH CAROLINE WHOM HE HAD
FIXED BY HIS SIDE NOW WITH SHIRLEY AND AGAIN WITH LOUIS MOORE
AND
LOUIS MET HIM IN CONGENIAL SPIRIT
HE DID NOT LAUGH MUCH BUT HE UTTERED
IN THE QUIETEST TONE THE WITTIEST THINGS
GRAVELY SPOKEN SENTENCES
MARKED BY UNEXPECTED TURNS AND A QUITE FRESH FLAVOUR AND POIGNANCY FELL
EASILY FROM HIS LIPS
HE PROVED HIMSELF TO BE WHAT MR
HALL HAD SAID HE
WAS EXCELLENT COMPANY
CAROLINE MARVELLED AT HIS HUMOUR BUT STILL MORE
AT HIS ENTIRE SELF POSSESSION
NOBODY THERE PRESENT SEEMED TO IMPOSE ON
HIM A SENSATION OF UNPLEASANT RESTRAINT
NOBODY SEEMED A BORE A
CHECK A CHILL TO HIM AND YET THERE WAS THE COOL AND LOFTY MISS KEELDAR
KNEELING BEFORE THE FIRE ALMOST AT HIS FEET
BUT SHIRLEY WAS COOL AND LOFTY NO LONGER AT LEAST NOT AT THIS MOMENT
SHE APPEARED UNCONSCIOUS OF THE HUMILITY OF HER PRESENT POSITION OR IF
CONSCIOUS IT WAS ONLY TO TASTE A CHARM IN ITS LOWLINESS
IT DID NOT
REVOLT HER PRIDE THAT THE GROUP TO WHOM SHE VOLUNTARILY OFFICIATED AS
HANDMAID SHOULD INCLUDE HER COUSIN'S TUTOR
IT DID NOT SCARE HER THAT
WHILE SHE HANDED THE BREAD AND MILK TO THE REST SHE HAD TO OFFER IT TO
HIM ALSO AND MOORE TOOK HIS PORTION FROM HER HAND AS CALMLY AS IF HE
HAD BEEN HER EQUAL
YOU ARE OVERHEATED NOW HE SAID WHEN SHE HAD RETAINED THE FORK FOR
SOME TIME LET ME RELIEVE YOU
AND HE TOOK IT FROM HER WITH A SORT OF QUIET AUTHORITY TO WHICH SHE
SUBMITTED PASSIVELY NEITHER RESISTING HIM NOR THANKING HIM
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR PICTURES LOUIS SAID CAROLINE WHEN THE
SUMPTUOUS LUNCHEON WAS DISCUSSED WOULD NOT YOU MR
HALL
TO PLEASE YOU I SHOULD BUT FOR MY OWN PART I HAVE CUT HIM AS AN
ARTIST
I HAD ENOUGH OF HIM IN THAT CAPACITY IN CUMBERLAND AND
WESTMORELAND
MANY A WETTING WE GOT AMONGST THE MOUNTAINS BECAUSE HE
WOULD PERSIST IN SITTING ON A CAMP STOOL CATCHING EFFECTS OF
RAIN CLOUDS GATHERING MISTS FITFUL SUNBEAMS AND WHAT NOT
HERE IS THE PORTFOLIO SAID HENRY BRINGING IT IN ONE HAND AND LEANING
ON HIS CRUTCH WITH THE OTHER
LOUIS TOOK IT BUT HE STILL SAT AS IF HE WANTED ANOTHER TO SPEAK
IT
SEEMED AS IF HE WOULD NOT OPEN IT UNLESS THE PROUD SHIRLEY DEIGNED TO
SHOW HERSELF INTERESTED IN THE EXHIBITION
HE MAKES US WAIT TO WHET OUR CURIOSITY SHE SAID
YOU UNDERSTAND OPENING IT OBSERVED LOUIS GIVING HER THE KEY
YOU
SPOILED THE LOCK FOR ME ONCE TRY NOW
HE HELD IT
SHE OPENED IT AND MONOPOLIZING THE CONTENTS HAD THE FIRST
VIEW OF EVERY SKETCH HERSELF
SHE ENJOYED THE TREAT IF TREAT IT
WERE IN SILENCE WITHOUT A SINGLE COMMENT
MOORE STOOD BEHIND HER CHAIR
AND LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER AND WHEN SHE HAD DONE AND THE OTHERS WERE
STILL GAZING HE LEFT HIS POST AND PACED THROUGH THE ROOM
A CARRIAGE WAS HEARD IN THE LANE THE GATE BELL RANG
SHIRLEY STARTED
THERE ARE CALLERS SHE SAID AND I SHALL BE SUMMONED TO THE ROOM
A
PRETTY FIGURE AS THEY SAY I AM TO RECEIVE COMPANY
I AND HENRY HAVE
BEEN IN THE GARDEN GATHERING FRUIT HALF THE MORNING
OH FOR REST UNDER
MY OWN VINE AND MY OWN FIG TREE HAPPY IS THE SLAVE WIFE OF THE INDIAN
CHIEF IN THAT SHE HAS NO DRAWING ROOM DUTY TO PERFORM BUT CAN SIT AT
EASE WEAVING MATS AND STRINGING BEADS AND PEACEFULLY FLATTENING HER
PICKANINNY'S HEAD IN AN UNMOLESTED CORNER OF HER WIGWAM
I'LL EMIGRATE
TO THE WESTERN WOODS
LOUIS MOORE LAUGHED
TO MARRY A WHITE CLOUD OR A BIG BUFFALO AND AFTER WEDLOCK TO DEVOTE
YOURSELF TO THE TENDER TASK OF DIGGING YOUR LORD'S MAIZE FIELD WHILE HE
SMOKES HIS PIPE OR DRINKS FIRE WATER
SHIRLEY SEEMED ABOUT TO REPLY BUT HERE THE SCHOOLROOM DOOR UNCLOSED
ADMITTING MR
SYMPSON
THAT PERSONAGE STOOD AGHAST WHEN HE SAW THE GROUP
AROUND THE FIRE
I THOUGHT YOU ALONE MISS KEELDAR HE SAID
I FIND QUITE A PARTY
AND EVIDENTLY FROM HIS SHOCKED SCANDALIZED AIR HAD HE NOT RECOGNIZED
IN ONE OF THE PARTY A CLERGYMAN HE WOULD HAVE DELIVERED AN EXTEMPORE
PHILIPPIC ON THE EXTRAORDINARY HABITS OF HIS NIECE RESPECT FOR THE
CLOTH ARRESTED HIM
I MERELY WISHED TO ANNOUNCE HE PROCEEDED COLDLY THAT THE FAMILY
FROM DE WALDEN HALL MR MRS THE MISSES AND MR
SAM WYNNE ARE IN
THE DRAWING ROOM AND HE BOWED AND WITHDREW
THE FAMILY FROM DE WALDEN HALL COULDN'T BE A WORSE SET MURMURED
SHIRLEY
SHE SAT STILL LOOKING A LITTLE CONTUMACIOUS AND VERY MUCH INDISPOSED
TO STIR
SHE WAS FLUSHED WITH THE FIRE
HER DARK HAIR HAD BEEN MORE THAN
ONCE DISHEVELLED BY THE MORNING WIND THAT DAY
HER ATTIRE WAS A LIGHT
NEATLY FITTING BUT AMPLY FLOWING DRESS OF MUSLIN THE SHAWL SHE HAD
WORN IN THE GARDEN WAS STILL DRAPED IN A CARELESS FOLD ROUND HER
INDOLENT WILFUL PICTURESQUE AND SINGULARLY PRETTY WAS HER
ASPECT PRETTIER THAN USUAL AS IF SOME SOFT INWARD EMOTION STIRRED WHO
KNOWS HOW HAD GIVEN NEW BLOOM AND EXPRESSION TO HER FEATURES
SHIRLEY SHIRLEY YOU OUGHT TO GO WHISPERED CAROLINE
I WONDER WHY
SHE LIFTED HER EYES AND SAW IN THE GLASS OVER THE FIREPLACE BOTH MR
HALL AND LOUIS MOORE GAZING AT HER GRAVELY
IF SHE SAID WITH A YIELDING SMILE IF A MAJORITY OF THE PRESENT
COMPANY MAINTAIN THAT THE DE WALDEN HALL PEOPLE HAVE CLAIMS ON MY
CIVILITY I WILL SUBDUE MY INCLINATIONS TO MY DUTY
LET THOSE WHO THINK
I OUGHT TO GO HOLD UP THEIR HANDS
AGAIN CONSULTING THE MIRROR IT REFLECTED AN UNANIMOUS VOTE AGAINST HER
YOU MUST GO SAID MR
HALL AND BEHAVE COURTEOUSLY TOO
YOU OWE MANY
DUTIES TO SOCIETY
IT IS NOT PERMITTED YOU TO PLEASE ONLY YOURSELF
LOUIS MOORE ASSENTED WITH A LOW HEAR HEAR
CAROLINE APPROACHING HER SMOOTHED HER WAVY CURLS GAVE TO HER ATTIRE A
LESS ARTISTIC AND MORE DOMESTIC GRACE AND SHIRLEY WAS PUT OUT OF THE
ROOM PROTESTING STILL BY A POUTING LIP AGAINST HER DISMISSAL
THERE IS A CURIOUS CHARM ABOUT HER OBSERVED MR
HALL WHEN SHE WAS
GONE
AND NOW HE ADDED I MUST AWAY FOR SWEETING IS OFF TO SEE HIS
MOTHER AND THERE ARE TWO FUNERALS
HENRY GET YOUR BOOKS IT IS LESSON TIME SAID MOORE SITTING DOWN TO
HIS DESK
A CURIOUS CHARM REPEATED THE PUPIL WHEN HE AND HIS MASTER WERE LEFT
ALONE
TRUE
IS SHE NOT A KIND OF WHITE WITCH HE ASKED
OF WHOM ARE YOU SPEAKING SIR
OF MY COUSIN SHIRLEY
NO IRRELEVANT QUESTIONS STUDY IN SILENCE
MR
MOORE LOOKED AND SPOKE STERNLY SOURLY
HENRY KNEW THIS MOOD
IT WAS
A RARE ONE WITH HIS TUTOR BUT WHEN IT CAME HE HAD AN AWE OF IT
HE
OBEYED
CHAPTER XXVII
THE FIRST BLUESTOCKING
MISS KEELDAR AND HER UNCLE HAD CHARACTERS THAT WOULD NOT HARMONIZE THAT
NEVER HAD HARMONIZED
HE WAS IRRITABLE AND SHE WAS SPIRITED
HE WAS
DESPOTIC AND SHE LIKED FREEDOM
HE WAS WORLDLY AND SHE PERHAPS
ROMANTIC
NOT WITHOUT PURPOSE HAD HE COME DOWN TO YORKSHIRE
HIS MISSION WAS
CLEAR AND HE INTENDED TO DISCHARGE IT CONSCIENTIOUSLY
HE ANXIOUSLY
DESIRED TO HAVE HIS NIECE MARRIED TO MAKE FOR HER A SUITABLE MATCH
GIVE HER IN CHARGE TO A PROPER HUSBAND AND WASH HIS HANDS OF HER FOR
EVER
THE MISFORTUNE WAS FROM INFANCY UPWARDS SHIRLEY AND HE HAD DISAGREED
ON THE MEANING OF THE WORDS SUITABLE AND PROPER SHE NEVER YET HAD
ACCEPTED HIS DEFINITION AND IT WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN THE MOST
IMPORTANT STEP OF HER LIFE SHE WOULD CONSENT TO ACCEPT IT
THE TRIAL SOON CAME
MR
WYNNE PROPOSED IN FORM FOR HIS SON SAMUEL FAWTHROP WYNNE
DECIDEDLY SUITABLE MOST PROPER PRONOUNCED MR
SYMPSON
A FINE
UNENCUMBERED ESTATE REAL SUBSTANCE GOOD CONNECTIONS
IT MUST BE
DONE
HE SENT FOR HIS NIECE TO THE OAK PARLOUR HE SHUT HIMSELF UP THERE WITH
HER ALONE HE COMMUNICATED THE OFFER HE GAVE HIS OPINION HE CLAIMED
HER CONSENT
IT WAS WITHHELD
NO I SHALL NOT MARRY SAMUEL FAWTHROP WYNNE
I ASK WHY
I MUST HAVE A REASON
IN ALL RESPECTS HE IS MORE THAN WORTHY
OF YOU
SHE STOOD ON THE HEARTH
SHE WAS PALE AS THE WHITE MARBLE SLAB AND
CORNICE BEHIND HER HER EYES FLASHED LARGE DILATED UNSMILING
AND I ASK IN WHAT SENSE THAT YOUNG MAN IS WORTHY OF ME
HE HAS TWICE YOUR MONEY TWICE YOUR COMMON SENSE EQUAL CONNECTIONS
EQUAL RESPECTABILITY
HAD HE MY MONEY COUNTED FIVESCORE TIMES I WOULD TAKE NO VOW TO LOVE
HIM
PLEASE TO STATE YOUR OBJECTIONS
HE HAS RUN A COURSE OF DESPICABLE COMMONPLACE PROFLIGACY
ACCEPT THAT
AS THE FIRST REASON WHY I SPURN HIM
MISS KEELDAR YOU SHOCK ME
THAT CONDUCT ALONE SINKS HIM IN A GULF OF IMMEASURABLE INFERIORITY
HIS
INTELLECT REACHES NO STANDARD I CAN ESTEEM THERE IS A SECOND
STUMBLING BLOCK
HIS VIEWS ARE NARROW HIS FEELINGS ARE BLUNT HIS
TASTES ARE COARSE HIS MANNERS VULGAR
THE MAN IS A RESPECTABLE WEALTHY MAN TO REFUSE HIM IS PRESUMPTION ON
YOUR PART
I REFUSE POINT BLANK CEASE TO ANNOY ME WITH THE SUBJECT I FORBID IT
IS IT YOUR INTENTION EVER TO MARRY OR DO YOU PREFER CELIBACY
I DENY YOUR RIGHT TO CLAIM AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
MAY I ASK IF YOU EXPECT SOME MAN OF TITLE SOME PEER OF THE REALM TO
DEMAND YOUR HAND
I DOUBT IF THE PEER BREATHES ON WHOM I WOULD CONFER IT
WERE THERE INSANITY IN THE FAMILY I SHOULD BELIEVE YOU MAD
YOUR
ECCENTRICITY AND CONCEIT TOUCH THE VERGE OF FRENZY
PERHAPS ERE I HAVE FINISHED YOU WILL SEE ME OVER LEAP IT
I ANTICIPATE NO LESS
FRANTIC AND IMPRACTICABLE GIRL TAKE WARNING I
DARE YOU TO SULLY OUR NAME BY A MSALLIANCE
OUR NAME AM I CALLED SYMPSON
GOD BE THANKED THAT YOU ARE NOT BUT BE ON YOUR GUARD I WILL NOT BE
TRIFLED WITH
WHAT IN THE NAME OF COMMON LAW AND COMMON SENSE WOULD YOU OR COULD
YOU DO IF MY PLEASURE LED ME TO A CHOICE YOU DISAPPROVED
TAKE CARE TAKE CARE WARNING HER WITH VOICE AND HAND THAT TREMBLED
ALIKE
WHY WHAT SHADOW OF POWER HAVE YOU OVER ME WHY SHOULD I FEAR YOU
TAKE CARE MADAM
SCRUPULOUS CARE I WILL TAKE MR
SYMPSON
BEFORE I MARRY I AM RESOLVED
TO ESTEEM TO ADMIRE TO LOVE
PREPOSTEROUS STUFF INDECOROUS UNWOMANLY
TO LOVE WITH MY WHOLE HEART
I KNOW I SPEAK IN AN UNKNOWN TONGUE BUT I
FEEL INDIFFERENT WHETHER I AM COMPREHENDED OR NOT
AND IF THIS LOVE OF YOURS SHOULD FALL ON A BEGGAR
ON A BEGGAR IT WILL NEVER FALL
MENDICANCY IS NOT ESTIMABLE
ON A LOW CLERK A PLAY ACTOR A PLAY WRITER OR OR
TAKE COURAGE MR
SYMPSON OR WHAT
ANY LITERARY SCRUB OR SHABBY WHINING ARTIST
FOR THE SCRUBBY SHABBY WHINING I HAVE NO TASTE FOR LITERATURE AND
THE ARTS I HAVE
AND THERE I WONDER HOW YOUR FAWTHROP WYNNE WOULD SUIT
ME
HE CANNOT WRITE A NOTE WITHOUT ORTHOGRAPHICAL ERRORS HE READS ONLY
A SPORTING PAPER HE WAS THE BOOBY OF STILBRO' GRAMMAR SCHOOL
UNLADYLIKE LANGUAGE GREAT GOD TO WHAT WILL SHE COME HE LIFTED HANDS
AND EYES
NEVER TO THE ALTAR OF HYMEN WITH SAM WYNNE
TO WHAT WILL SHE COME WHY ARE NOT THE LAWS MORE STRINGENT THAT I
MIGHT COMPEL HER TO HEAR REASON
CONSOLE YOURSELF UNCLE
WERE BRITAIN A SERFDOM AND YOU THE CZAR YOU
COULD NOT COMPEL ME TO THIS STEP
I WILL WRITE TO MR
WYNNE
GIVE
YOURSELF NO FURTHER TROUBLE ON THE SUBJECT
FORTUNE IS PROVERBIALLY CALLED CHANGEFUL YET HER CAPRICE OFTEN TAKES
THE FORM OF REPEATING AGAIN AND AGAIN A SIMILAR STROKE OF LUCK IN THE
SAME QUARTER
IT APPEARED THAT MISS KEELDAR OR HER FORTUNE HAD BY THIS
TIME MADE A SENSATION IN THE DISTRICT AND PRODUCED AN IMPRESSION IN
QUARTERS BY HER UNTHOUGHT OF
NO LESS THAN THREE OFFERS FOLLOWED MR
WYNNE'S ALL MORE OR LESS ELIGIBLE
ALL WERE IN SUCCESSION PRESSED ON
HER BY HER UNCLE AND ALL IN SUCCESSION SHE REFUSED
YET AMONGST THEM
WAS MORE THAN ONE GENTLEMAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER AS WELL AS
AMPLE WEALTH
MANY BESIDES HER UNCLE ASKED WHAT SHE MEANT AND WHOM SHE
EXPECTED TO ENTRAP THAT SHE WAS SO INSOLENTLY FASTIDIOUS
AT LAST THE GOSSIPS THOUGHT THEY HAD FOUND THE KEY TO HER CONDUCT AND
HER UNCLE WAS SURE OF IT AND WHAT IS MORE THE DISCOVERY SHOWED HIS
NIECE TO HIM IN QUITE A NEW LIGHT AND HE CHANGED HIS WHOLE DEPORTMENT
TO HER ACCORDINGLY
FIELDHEAD HAD OF LATE BEEN FAST GROWING TOO HOT TO HOLD THEM BOTH
THE
SUAVE AUNT COULD NOT RECONCILE THEM THE DAUGHTERS FROZE AT THE VIEW OF
THEIR QUARRELS
GERTRUDE AND ISABELLA WHISPERED BY THE HOUR TOGETHER IN
THEIR DRESSING ROOM AND BECAME CHILLED WITH DECOROUS DREAD IF THEY
CHANCED TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH THEIR AUDACIOUS COUSIN
BUT AS I HAVE
SAID A CHANGE SUPERVENED
MR
SYMPSON WAS APPEASED AND HIS FAMILY
TRANQUILLIZED
THE VILLAGE OF NUNNELY HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO ITS OLD CHURCH ITS FOREST
ITS MONASTIC RUINS
IT HAD ALSO ITS HALL CALLED THE PRIORY AN OLDER A
LARGER A MORE LORDLY ABODE THAN ANY BRIARFIELD OR WHINBURY OWNED AND
WHAT IS MORE IT HAD ITS MAN OF TITLE ITS BARONET WHICH NEITHER
BRIARFIELD NOR WHINBURY COULD BOAST
THIS POSSESSION ITS PROUDEST AND
MOST PRIZED HAD FOR YEARS BEEN NOMINAL ONLY
THE PRESENT BARONET A
YOUNG MAN HITHERTO RESIDENT IN A DISTANT PROVINCE WAS UNKNOWN ON HIS
YORKSHIRE ESTATE
DURING MISS KEELDAR'S STAY AT THE FASHIONABLE WATERING PLACE OF
CLIFFBRIDGE SHE AND HER FRIENDS HAD MET WITH AND BEEN INTRODUCED TO SIR
PHILIP NUNNELY
THEY ENCOUNTERED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN ON THE SANDS THE
CLIFFS IN THE VARIOUS WALKS SOMETIMES AT THE PUBLIC BALLS OF THE
PLACE
HE SEEMED SOLITARY
HIS MANNER WAS VERY UNPRETENDING TOO SIMPLE
TO BE TERMED AFFABLE RATHER TIMID THAN PROUD
HE DID NOT CONDESCEND
TO THEIR SOCIETY HE SEEMED GLAD OF IT
WITH ANY UNAFFECTED INDIVIDUAL SHIRLEY COULD EASILY AND QUICKLY CEMENT
AN ACQUAINTANCE
SHE WALKED AND TALKED WITH SIR PHILIP SHE HER AUNT
AND COUSINS SOMETIMES TOOK A SAIL IN HIS YACHT
SHE LIKED HIM BECAUSE
SHE FOUND HIM KIND AND MODEST AND WAS CHARMED TO FEEL SHE HAD THE POWER
TO AMUSE HIM
ONE SLIGHT DRAWBACK THERE WAS WHERE IS THE FRIENDSHIP WITHOUT IT SIR
PHILIP HAD A LITERARY TURN
HE WROTE POETRY SONNETS STANZAS BALLADS
PERHAPS MISS KEELDAR THOUGHT HIM A LITTLE TOO FOND OF READING AND
RECITING THESE COMPOSITIONS PERHAPS SHE WISHED THE RHYME HAD POSSESSED
MORE ACCURACY THE MEASURE MORE MUSIC THE TROPES MORE FRESHNESS THE
INSPIRATION MORE FIRE
AT ANY RATE SHE ALWAYS WINCED WHEN HE RECURRED
TO THE SUBJECT OF HIS POEMS AND USUALLY DID HER BEST TO DIVERT THE
CONVERSATION INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
HE WOULD BEGUILE HER TO TAKE MOONLIGHT WALKS WITH HIM ON THE BRIDGE FOR
THE SOLE PURPOSE AS IT SEEMED OF POURING INTO HER EAR THE LONGEST OF
HIS BALLADS
HE WOULD LEAD HER AWAY TO SEQUESTERED RUSTIC SEATS WHENCE
THE RUSH OF THE SURF TO THE SANDS WAS HEARD SOFT AND SOOTHING AND WHEN
HE HAD HER ALL TO HIMSELF AND THE SEA LAY BEFORE THEM AND THE SCENTED
SHADE OF GARDENS SPREAD ROUND AND THE TALL SHELTER OF CLIFFS ROSE
BEHIND THEM HE WOULD PULL OUT HIS LAST BATCH OF SONNETS AND READ THEM
IN A VOICE TREMULOUS WITH EMOTION
HE DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW THAT THOUGH
THEY MIGHT BE RHYME THEY WERE NOT POETRY
IT APPEARED BY SHIRLEY'S
DOWNCAST EYE AND DISTURBED FACE THAT SHE KNEW IT AND FELT HEARTILY
MORTIFIED BY THE SINGLE FOIBLE OF THIS GOOD AND AMIABLE GENTLEMAN
OFTEN SHE TRIED AS GENTLY AS MIGHT BE TO WEAN HIM FROM THIS FANATIC
WORSHIP OF THE MUSES
IT WAS HIS MONOMANIA ON ALL ORDINARY SUBJECTS HE
WAS SENSIBLE ENOUGH AND FAIN WAS SHE TO ENGAGE HIM IN ORDINARY TOPICS
HE QUESTIONED HER SOMETIMES ABOUT HIS PLACE AT NUNNELY SHE WAS BUT TOO
HAPPY TO ANSWER HIS INTERROGATORIES AT LENGTH
SHE NEVER WEARIED OF
DESCRIBING THE ANTIQUE PRIORY THE WILD SILVAN PARK THE HOARY CHURCH
AND HAMLET NOR DID SHE FAIL TO COUNSEL HIM TO COME DOWN AND GATHER HIS
TENANTRY ABOUT HIM IN HIS ANCESTRAL HALLS
SOMEWHAT TO HER SURPRISE SIR PHILIP FOLLOWED HER ADVICE TO THE LETTER
AND ACTUALLY TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF SEPTEMBER ARRIVED AT THE PRIORY
HE SOON MADE A CALL AT FIELDHEAD AND HIS FIRST VISIT WAS NOT HIS LAST
HE SAID WHEN HE HAD ACHIEVED THE ROUND OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT UNDER
NO ROOF HAD HE FOUND SUCH PLEASANT SHELTER AS BENEATH THE MASSIVE OAK
BEAMS OF THE GRAY MANOR HOUSE OF BRIARFIELD A CRAMPED MODEST DWELLING
ENOUGH COMPARED WITH HIS OWN BUT HE LIKED IT
PRESENTLY IT DID NOT SUFFICE TO SIT WITH SHIRLEY IN HER PANELLED
PARLOUR WHERE OTHERS CAME AND WENT AND WHERE HE COULD RARELY FIND A
QUIET MOMENT TO SHOW HER THE LATEST PRODUCTION OF HIS FERTILE MUSE HE
MUST HAVE HER OUT AMONGST THE PLEASANT PASTURES AND LEAD HER BY THE
STILL WATERS
TTE TTE RAMBLINGS SHE SHUNNED SO HE MADE PARTIES
FOR HER TO HIS OWN GROUNDS HIS GLORIOUS FOREST TO REMOTER
SCENES WOODS SEVERED BY THE WHARFE VALES WATERED BY THE AIRE
SUCH ASSIDUITY COVERED MISS KEELDAR WITH DISTINCTION
HER UNCLE'S
PROPHETIC SOUL ANTICIPATED A SPLENDID FUTURE
HE ALREADY SCENTED THE
TIME AFAR OFF WHEN WITH NONCHALANT AIR AND LEFT FOOT NURSED ON HIS
RIGHT KNEE HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE DASHINGLY FAMILIAR ALLUSION TO HIS
NEPHEW THE BARONET NOW HIS NIECE DAWNED UPON HIM NO LONGER A MAD
GIRL BUT A MOST SENSIBLE WOMAN HE TERMED HER IN CONFIDENTIAL
DIALOGUES WITH MRS
SYMPSON A TRULY SUPERIOR PERSON PECULIAR BUT
VERY CLEVER HE TREATED HER WITH EXCEEDING DEFERENCE ROSE REVERENTLY
TO OPEN AND SHUT DOORS FOR HER REDDENED HIS FACE AND GAVE HIMSELF
HEADACHES WITH STOOPING TO PICK UP GLOVES HANDKERCHIEFS AND OTHER
LOOSE PROPERTY WHEREOF SHIRLEY USUALLY HELD BUT INSECURE TENURE
HE
WOULD CUT MYSTERIOUS JOKES ABOUT THE SUPERIORITY OF WOMAN'S WIT OVER
MAN'S WISDOM COMMENCE OBSCURE APOLOGIES FOR THE BLUNDERING MISTAKE HE
HAD COMMITTED RESPECTING THE GENERALSHIP THE TACTICS OF A PERSONAGE
NOT A HUNDRED MILES FROM FIELDHEAD IN SHORT HE SEEMED ELATE AS ANY
MIDDEN COCK ON PATTENS
HIS NIECE VIEWED HIS MANUVRES AND RECEIVED HIS INNUENDOES WITH PHLEGM
APPARENTLY SHE DID NOT ABOVE HALF COMPREHEND TO WHAT AIM THEY TENDED
WHEN PLAINLY CHARGED WITH BEING THE PREFERRED OF THE BARONET SHE SAID
SHE BELIEVED HE DID LIKE HER AND FOR HER PART SHE LIKED HIM
SHE HAD
NEVER THOUGHT A MAN OF RANK THE ONLY SON OF A PROUD FOND MOTHER THE
ONLY BROTHER OF DOTING SISTERS COULD HAVE SO MUCH GOODNESS AND ON THE
WHOLE SO MUCH SENSE
TIME PROVED INDEED THAT SIR PHILIP LIKED HER
PERHAPS HE HAD FOUND IN
HER THAT CURIOUS CHARM NOTICED BY MR
HALL
HE SOUGHT HER PRESENCE
MORE AND MORE AND AT LAST WITH A FREQUENCY THAT ATTESTED IT HAD BECOME
TO HIM AN INDISPENSABLE STIMULUS
ABOUT THIS TIME STRANGE FEELINGS
HOVERED ROUND FIELDHEAD RESTLESS HOPES AND HAGGARD ANXIETIES HAUNTED
SOME OF ITS ROOMS
THERE WAS AN UNQUIET WANDERING OF SOME OF THE INMATES
AMONG THE STILL FIELDS ROUND THE MANSION THERE WAS A SENSE OF
EXPECTANCY THAT KEPT THE NERVES STRAINED
ONE THING SEEMED CLEAR SIR PHILIP WAS NOT A MAN TO BE DESPISED
HE WAS
AMIABLE IF NOT HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL HE WAS INTELLIGENT
MISS KEELDAR
COULD NOT AFFIRM OF HIM WHAT SHE HAD SO BITTERLY AFFIRMED OF SAM WYNNE
THAT HIS FEELINGS WERE BLUNT HIS TASTES COARSE AND HIS MANNERS VULGAR
THERE WAS SENSIBILITY IN HIS NATURE THERE WAS A VERY REAL IF NOT A
VERY DISCRIMINATING LOVE OF THE ARTS THERE WAS THE ENGLISH GENTLEMAN
IN ALL HIS DEPORTMENT
AS TO HIS LINEAGE AND WEALTH BOTH WERE OF
COURSE FAR BEYOND HER CLAIMS
HIS APPEARANCE HAD AT FIRST ELICITED SOME LAUGHING THOUGH NOT
ILL NATURED REMARKS FROM THE MERRY SHIRLEY
IT WAS BOYISH
HIS FEATURES
WERE PLAIN AND SLIGHT HIS HAIR SANDY HIS STATURE INSIGNIFICANT
BUT
SHE SOON CHECKED HER SARCASM ON THIS POINT SHE WOULD EVEN FIRE UP IF
ANY ONE ELSE MADE UNCOMPLIMENTARY ALLUSION THERETO
HE HAD A PLEASING
COUNTENANCE SHE AFFIRMED AND THERE WAS THAT IN HIS HEART WHICH WAS
BETTER THAN THREE ROMAN NOSES THAN THE LOCKS OF ABSALOM OR THE
PROPORTIONS OF SAUL A SPARE AND RARE SHAFT SHE STILL RESERVED FOR HIS
UNFORTUNATE POETIC PROPENSITY BUT EVEN HERE SHE WOULD TOLERATE NO IRONY
SAVE HER OWN
IN SHORT MATTERS HAD REACHED A POINT WHICH SEEMED FULLY TO WARRANT AN
OBSERVATION MADE ABOUT THIS TIME BY MR
YORKE TO THE TUTOR LOUIS
YOND' BROTHER ROBERT OF YOURS SEEMS TO ME TO BE EITHER A FOOL OR A
MADMAN
TWO MONTHS AGO I COULD HAVE SWORN HE HAD THE GAME ALL IN HIS OWN
HANDS AND THERE HE RUNS THE COUNTRY AND QUARTERS HIMSELF UP IN LONDON
FOR WEEKS TOGETHER AND BY THE TIME HE COMES BACK HE'LL FIND HIMSELF
CHECKMATED
LOUIS 'THERE IS A TIDE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN WHICH TAKEN
AT THE FLOOD LEADS ON TO FORTUNE BUT ONCE LET SLIP NEVER RETURNS
AGAIN I'D WRITE TO ROBERT IF I WERE YOU AND REMIND HIM OF THAT
ROBERT HAD VIEWS ON MISS KEELDAR INQUIRED LOUIS AS IF THE IDEA WAS
NEW TO HIM
VIEWS I SUGGESTED TO HIM MYSELF AND VIEWS HE MIGHT HAVE REALIZED FOR
SHE LIKED HIM
AS A NEIGHBOUR
AS MORE THAN THAT
I HAVE SEEN HER CHANGE COUNTENANCE AND COLOUR AT THE
MERE MENTION OF HIS NAME
WRITE TO THE LAD I SAY AND TELL HIM TO COME
HOME
HE IS A FINER GENTLEMAN THAN THIS BIT OF A BARONET AFTER ALL
DOES IT NOT STRIKE YOU MR
YORKE THAT FOR A MERE PENNILESS ADVENTURER
TO ASPIRE TO A RICH WOMAN'S HAND IS PRESUMPTUOUS CONTEMPTIBLE
OH IF YOU ARE FOR HIGH NOTIONS AND DOUBLE REFINED SENTIMENT I'VE
NAUGHT TO SAY
I'M A PLAIN PRACTICAL MAN MYSELF AND IF ROBERT IS
WILLING TO GIVE UP THAT ROYAL PRIZE TO A LAD RIVAL A PULING SLIP OF
ARISTOCRACY I AM QUITE AGREEABLE
AT HIS AGE IN HIS PLACE WITH
HIS INDUCEMENTS I WOULD HAVE ACTED DIFFERENTLY
NEITHER BARONET NOR
DUKE NOR PRINCE SHOULD HAVE SNATCHED MY SWEETHEART FROM ME WITHOUT A
STRUGGLE
BUT YOU TUTORS ARE SUCH SOLEMN CHAPS IT IS ALMOST LIKE
SPEAKING TO A PARSON TO CONSULT WITH YOU
FLATTERED AND FAWNED UPON AS SHIRLEY WAS JUST NOW IT APPEARED SHE WAS
NOT ABSOLUTELY SPOILED THAT HER BETTER NATURE DID NOT QUITE LEAVE HER
UNIVERSAL REPORT HAD INDEED CEASED TO COUPLE HER NAME WITH THAT OF
MOORE AND THIS SILENCE SEEMED SANCTIONED BY HER OWN APPARENT OBLIVION
OF THE ABSENTEE BUT THAT SHE HAD NOT QUITE FORGOTTEN HIM THAT SHE
STILL REGARDED HIM IF NOT WITH LOVE YET WITH INTEREST SEEMED PROVED
BY THE INCREASED ATTENTION WHICH AT THIS JUNCTURE OF AFFAIRS A SUDDEN
ATTACK OF ILLNESS INDUCED HER TO SHOW THAT TUTOR BROTHER OF ROBERT'S TO
WHOM SHE HABITUALLY BORE HERSELF WITH STRANGE ALTERNATIONS OF COOL
RESERVE AND DOCILE RESPECT NOW SWEEPING PAST HIM IN ALL THE DIGNITY OF
THE MONEYED HEIRESS AND PROSPECTIVE LADY NUNNELY AND ANON ACCOSTING HIM
AS ABASHED SCHOOL GIRLS ARE WONT TO ACCOST THEIR STERN PROFESSORS
BRIDLING HER NECK OF IVORY AND CURLING HER LIP OF CARMINE IF HE
ENCOUNTERED HER GLANCE ONE MINUTE AND THE NEXT SUBMITTING TO THE GRAVE
REBUKE OF HIS EYE WITH AS MUCH CONTRITION AS IF HE HAD THE POWER TO
INFLICT PENALTIES IN CASE OF CONTUMACY
LOUIS MOORE HAD PERHAPS CAUGHT THE FEVER WHICH FOR A FEW DAYS LAID HIM
LOW IN ONE OF THE POOR COTTAGES OF THE DISTRICT WHICH HE HIS LAME
PUPIL AND MR
HALL WERE IN THE HABIT OF VISITING TOGETHER
AT ANY RATE
HE SICKENED AND AFTER OPPOSING TO THE MALADY A TACITURN RESISTANCE FOR
A DAY OR TWO WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP HIS CHAMBER
HE LAY TOSSING ON HIS THORNY BED ONE EVENING HENRY WHO WOULD NOT QUIT
HIM WATCHING FAITHFULLY BESIDE HIM WHEN A TAP TOO LIGHT TO BE THAT OF
MRS
GILL OR THE HOUSEMAID SUMMONED YOUNG SYMPSON TO THE DOOR
HOW IS MR
MOORE TO NIGHT ASKED A LOW VOICE FROM THE DARK GALLERY
COME IN AND SEE HIM YOURSELF
IS HE ASLEEP
I WISH HE COULD SLEEP
COME AND SPEAK TO HIM SHIRLEY
HE WOULD NOT LIKE IT
BUT THE SPEAKER STEPPED IN AND HENRY SEEING HER HESITATE ON THE
THRESHOLD TOOK HER HAND AND DREW HER TO THE COUCH
THE SHADED LIGHT SHOWED MISS KEELDAR'S FORM BUT IMPERFECTLY YET IT
REVEALED HER IN ELEGANT ATTIRE
THERE WAS A PARTY ASSEMBLED BELOW
INCLUDING SIR PHILIP NUNNELY THE LADIES WERE NOW IN THE DRAWING ROOM
AND THEIR HOSTESS HAD STOLEN FROM THEM TO VISIT HENRY'S TUTOR
HER PURE
WHITE DRESS HER FAIR ARMS AND NECK THE TREMBLING CHAINLET OF GOLD
CIRCLING HER THROAT AND QUIVERING ON HER BREAST GLISTENED STRANGELY
AMID THE OBSCURITY OF THE SICKROOM
HER MIEN WAS CHASTENED AND PENSIVE
SHE SPOKE GENTLY
MR
MOORE HOW ARE YOU TO NIGHT
I HAVE NOT BEEN VERY ILL AND AM NOW BETTER
I HEARD THAT YOU COMPLAINED OF THIRST
I HAVE BROUGHT YOU SOME GRAPES
CAN YOU TASTE ONE
NO BUT I THANK YOU FOR REMEMBERING ME
JUST ONE
FROM THE RICH CLUSTER THAT FILLED A SMALL BASKET HELD IN HER HAND SHE
SEVERED A BERRY AND OFFERED IT TO HIS LIPS
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND
TURNED ASIDE HIS FLUSHED FACE
BUT WHAT THEN CAN I BRING YOU INSTEAD YOU HAVE NO WISH FOR FRUIT
YET I SEE THAT YOUR LIPS ARE PARCHED
WHAT BEVERAGE DO YOU PREFER
MRS
GILL SUPPLIES ME WITH TOAST AND WATER
I LIKE IT BEST
SILENCE FELL FOR SOME MINUTES
DO YOU SUFFER HAVE YOU PAIN
VERY LITTLE
WHAT MADE YOU ILL
SILENCE
I WONDER WHAT CAUSED THIS FEVER TO WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE IT
MIASMA PERHAPS MALARIA
THIS IS AUTUMN A SEASON FERTILE IN FEVERS
I HEAR YOU OFTEN VISIT THE SICK IN BRIARFIELD AND NUNNELY TOO WITH
MR
HALL
YOU SHOULD BE ON YOUR GUARD TEMERITY IS NOT WISE
THAT REMINDS ME MISS KEELDAR THAT PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER NOT ENTER
THIS CHAMBER OR COME NEAR THIS COUCH
I DO NOT BELIEVE MY ILLNESS IS
INFECTIOUS
I SCARCELY FEAR WITH A SORT OF SMILE YOU WILL TAKE IT
BUT WHY SHOULD YOU RUN EVEN THE SHADOW OF A RISK LEAVE ME
PATIENCE I WILL GO SOON BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU
BEFORE I DEPART ANY LITTLE SERVICE
THEY WILL MISS YOU BELOW
NO THE GENTLEMEN ARE STILL AT TABLE
THEY WILL NOT LINGER LONG
SIR PHILIP NUNNELY IS NO WINE BIBBER AND I
HEAR HIM JUST NOW PASS FROM THE DINING ROOM TO THE DRAWING ROOM
IT IS A SERVANT
IT IS SIR PHILIP I KNOW HIS STEP
YOUR HEARING IS ACUTE
IT IS NEVER DULL AND THE SENSE SEEMS SHARPENED AT PRESENT
SIR PHILIP
WAS HERE TO TEA LAST NIGHT
I HEARD YOU SING TO HIM SOME SONG WHICH HE
HAD BROUGHT YOU
I HEARD HIM WHEN HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AT ELEVEN
O'CLOCK CALL YOU OUT ON TO THE PAVEMENT TO LOOK AT THE EVENING STAR
YOU MUST BE NERVOUSLY SENSITIVE
I HEARD HIM KISS YOUR HAND
IMPOSSIBLE
NO MY CHAMBER IS OVER THE HALL THE WINDOW JUST ABOVE THE FRONT DOOR
THE SASH WAS A LITTLE RAISED FOR I FELT FEVERISH
YOU STOOD TEN MINUTES
WITH HIM ON THE STEPS
I HEARD YOUR DISCOURSE EVERY WORD AND I HEARD
THE SALUTE HENRY GIVE ME SOME WATER
LET ME GIVE IT HIM
BUT HE HALF ROSE TO TAKE THE GLASS FROM YOUNG SYMPSON AND DECLINED HER
ATTENDANCE
AND CAN I DO NOTHING
NOTHING FOR YOU CANNOT GUARANTEE ME A NIGHT'S PEACEFUL REST AND IT IS
ALL I AT PRESENT WANT
YOU DO NOT SLEEP WELL
SLEEP HAS LEFT ME
YET YOU SAID YOU WERE NOT VERY ILL
I AM OFTEN SLEEPLESS WHEN IN HIGH HEALTH
IF I HAD POWER I WOULD LAP YOU IN THE MOST PLACID SLUMBER QUITE DEEP
AND HUSHED WITHOUT A DREAM
BLANK ANNIHILATION I DO NOT ASK THAT
WITH DREAMS OF ALL YOU MOST DESIRE
MONSTROUS DELUSIONS THE SLEEP WOULD BE DELIRIUM THE WAKING DEATH
YOUR WISHES ARE NOT SO CHIMERICAL YOU ARE NO VISIONARY
MISS KEELDAR I SUPPOSE YOU THINK SO BUT MY CHARACTER IS NOT PERHAPS
QUITE AS LEGIBLE TO YOU AS A PAGE OF THE LAST NEW NOVEL MIGHT BE
THAT IS POSSIBLE
BUT THIS SLEEP I SHOULD LIKE TO WOO IT TO YOUR
PILLOW TO WIN FOR YOU ITS FAVOUR
IF I TOOK A BOOK AND SAT DOWN AND
READ SOME PAGES I CAN WELL SPARE HALF AN HOUR
THANK YOU BUT I WILL NOT DETAIN YOU
I WOULD READ SOFTLY
IT WOULD NOT DO
I AM TOO FEVERISH AND EXCITABLE TO BEAR A SOFT
COOING VIBRATING VOICE CLOSE AT MY EAR
YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
WELL I WILL GO
AND NO GOOD NIGHT
YES SIR YES
MR
MOORE GOOD NIGHT EXIT SHIRLEY
HENRY MY BOY GO TO BED NOW IT IS TIME YOU HAD SOME REPOSE
SIR IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO WATCH AT YOUR BEDSIDE ALL NIGHT
NOTHING LESS CALLED FOR
I AM GETTING BETTER
THERE GO
GIVE ME YOUR BLESSING SIR
GOD BLESS YOU MY BEST PUPIL
YOU NEVER CALL ME YOUR DEAREST PUPIL
NO NOR EVER SHALL
POSSIBLY MISS KEELDAR RESENTED HER FORMER TEACHER'S REJECTION OF HER
COURTESY
IT IS CERTAIN SHE DID NOT REPEAT THE OFFER OF IT
OFTEN AS HER
LIGHT STEP TRAVERSED THE GALLERY IN THE COURSE OF A DAY IT DID NOT
AGAIN PAUSE AT HIS DOOR NOR DID HER COOING VIBRATING VOICE DISTURB A
SECOND TIME THE HUSH OF THE SICKROOM
A SICKROOM INDEED IT SOON CEASED
TO BE MR
MOORE'S GOOD CONSTITUTION QUICKLY TRIUMPHED OVER HIS
INDISPOSITION
IN A FEW DAYS HE SHOOK IT OFF AND RESUMED HIS DUTIES AS
TUTOR
THAT AULD LANG SYNE HAD STILL ITS AUTHORITY BOTH WITH PRECEPTOR AND
SCHOLAR WAS PROVED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SOMETIMES PROMPTLY PASSED
THE DISTANCE SHE USUALLY MAINTAINED BETWEEN THEM AND PUT DOWN HER HIGH
RESERVE WITH A FIRM QUIET HAND
ONE AFTERNOON THE SYMPSON FAMILY WERE GONE OUT TO TAKE A CARRIAGE
AIRING
SHIRLEY NEVER SORRY TO SNATCH A REPRIEVE FROM THEIR SOCIETY
HAD REMAINED BEHIND DETAINED BY BUSINESS AS SHE SAID
THE BUSINESS A
LITTLE LETTER WRITING WAS SOON DISPATCHED AFTER THE YARD GATES HAD
CLOSED ON THE CARRIAGE MISS KEELDAR BETOOK HERSELF TO THE GARDEN
IT WAS A PEACEFUL AUTUMN DAY
THE GILDING OF THE INDIAN SUMMER MELLOWED
THE PASTURES FAR AND WIDE
THE RUSSET WOODS STOOD RIPE TO BE STRIPPED
BUT WERE YET FULL OF LEAF
THE PURPLE OF HEATH BLOOM FADED BUT NOT
WITHERED TINGED THE HILLS
THE BECK WANDERED DOWN TO THE HOLLOW
THROUGH A SILENT DISTRICT NO WIND FOLLOWED ITS COURSE OR HAUNTED ITS
WOODY BORDERS
FIELDHEAD GARDENS BORE THE SEAL OF GENTLE DECAY
ON THE
WALKS SWEPT THAT MORNING YELLOW LEAVES HAD FLUTTERED DOWN AGAIN
ITS
TIME OF FLOWERS AND EVEN OF FRUITS WAS OVER BUT A SCANTLING OF
APPLES ENRICHED THE TREES
ONLY A BLOSSOM HERE AND THERE EXPANDED PALE
AND DELICATE AMIDST A KNOT OF FADED LEAVES
THESE SINGLE FLOWERS THE LAST OF THEIR RACE SHIRLEY CULLED AS SHE
WANDERED THOUGHTFULLY AMONGST THE BEDS
SHE WAS FASTENING INTO HER
GIRDLE A HUELESS AND SCENTLESS NOSEGAY WHEN HENRY SYMPSON CALLED TO HER
AS HE CAME LIMPING FROM THE HOUSE
SHIRLEY MR
MOORE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU IN THE SCHOOLROOM AND TO
HEAR YOU READ A LITTLE FRENCH IF YOU HAVE NO MORE URGENT OCCUPATION
THE MESSENGER DELIVERED HIS COMMISSION VERY SIMPLY AS IF IT WERE A MERE
MATTER OF COURSE
DID MR
MOORE TELL YOU TO SAY THAT
CERTAINLY WHY NOT AND NOW DO COME AND LET US ONCE MORE BE AS WE
WERE AT SYMPSON GROVE
WE USED TO HAVE PLEASANT SCHOOL HOURS IN THOSE
DAYS
MISS KEELDAR PERHAPS THOUGHT THAT CIRCUMSTANCES WERE CHANGED SINCE THEN
HOWEVER SHE MADE NO REMARK BUT AFTER A LITTLE REFLECTION QUIETLY
FOLLOWED HENRY
ENTERING THE SCHOOLROOM SHE INCLINED HER HEAD WITH A DECENT OBEISANCE
AS HAD BEEN HER WONT IN FORMER TIMES
SHE REMOVED HER BONNET AND HUNG
IT UP BESIDE HENRY'S CAP
LOUIS MOORE SAT AT HIS DESK TURNING THE
LEAVES OF A BOOK OPEN BEFORE HIM AND MARKING PASSAGES WITH HIS PENCIL
HE JUST MOVED IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HER CURTSY BUT DID NOT RISE
YOU PROPOSED TO READ TO ME A FEW NIGHTS AGO SAID HE
I COULD NOT
HEAR YOU THEN
MY ATTENTION IS NOW AT YOUR SERVICE
A LITTLE RENEWED
PRACTICE IN FRENCH MAY NOT BE UNPROFITABLE
YOUR ACCENT I HAVE
OBSERVED BEGINS TO RUST
WHAT BOOK SHALL I TAKE
HERE ARE THE POSTHUMOUS WORKS OF ST
PIERRE
READ A FEW PAGES OF THE
'FRAGMENTS DE L'AMAZONE
SHE ACCEPTED THE CHAIR WHICH HE HAD PLACED IN READINESS NEAR HIS OWN
THE VOLUME LAY ON HIS DESK THERE WAS BUT ONE BETWEEN THEM HER SWEEPING
CURLS DROPPED SO LOW AS TO HIDE THE PAGE FROM HIM
PUT BACK YOUR HAIR HE SAID
FOR ONE MOMENT SHIRLEY LOOKED NOT QUITE CERTAIN WHETHER SHE WOULD OBEY
THE REQUEST OR DISREGARD IT
A FLICKER OF HER EYE BEAMED FURTIVE ON THE
PROFESSOR'S FACE
PERHAPS IF HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER HARSHLY OR
TIMIDLY OR IF ONE UNDECIDED LINE HAD MARKED HIS COUNTENANCE SHE WOULD
HAVE REBELLED AND THE LESSON HAD ENDED THERE AND THEN BUT HE WAS ONLY
AWAITING HER COMPLIANCE AS CALM AS MARBLE AND AS COOL
SHE THREW THE
VEIL OF TRESSES BEHIND HER EAR
IT WAS WELL HER FACE OWNED AN AGREEABLE
OUTLINE AND THAT HER CHEEK POSSESSED THE POLISH AND THE ROUNDNESS OF
EARLY YOUTH OR THUS ROBBED OF A SOFTENING SHADE THE CONTOURS MIGHT
HAVE LOST THEIR GRACE
BUT WHAT MATTERED THAT IN THE PRESENT SOCIETY
NEITHER CALYPSO NOR EUCHARIS CARED TO FASCINATE MENTOR
SHE BEGAN TO READ
THE LANGUAGE HAD BECOME STRANGE TO HER TONGUE IT
FALTERED THE LECTURE FLOWED UNEVENLY IMPEDED BY HURRIED BREATH BROKEN
BY ANGLICIZED TONES
SHE STOPPED
I CAN'T DO IT
READ ME A PARAGRAPH IF YOU PLEASE MR
MOORE
WHAT HE READ SHE REPEATED
SHE CAUGHT HIS ACCENT IN THREE MINUTES
TRS BIEN WAS THE APPROVING COMMENT AT THE CLOSE OF THE PIECE
C'EST PRESQUE LE FRANAIS RATTRAP N'EST CE PAS
YOU COULD NOT WRITE FRENCH AS YOU ONCE COULD I DARE SAY
OH NO I SHOULD MAKE STRANGE WORK OF MY CONCORDS NOW
YOU COULD NOT COMPOSE THE DEVOIR OF 'LA PREMIRE FEMME SAVANTE'
DO YOU STILL REMEMBER THAT RUBBISH
EVERY LINE
I DOUBT YOU
I WILL ENGAGE TO REPEAT IT WORD FOR WORD
YOU WOULD STOP SHORT AT THE FIRST LINE
CHALLENGE ME TO THE EXPERIMENT
I CHALLENGE YOU
HE PROCEEDED TO RECITE THE FOLLOWING
HE GAVE IT IN FRENCH BUT WE MUST
TRANSLATE ON PAIN OF BEING UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SOME READERS
AND IT CAME TO PASS WHEN MEN BEGAN TO MULTIPLY ON THE FACE OF
THE EARTH AND DAUGHTERS WERE BORN UNTO THEM THAT THE SONS
OF GOD SAW THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN THAT THEY WERE FAIR AND THEY
TOOK THEM WIVES OF ALL WHICH THEY CHOSE
THIS WAS IN THE DAWN OF TIME BEFORE THE MORNING STARS WERE SET AND
WHILE THEY YET SANG TOGETHER
THE EPOCH IS SO REMOTE THE MISTS AND DEWY GRAY OF MATIN TWILIGHT VEIL
IT WITH SO VAGUE AN OBSCURITY THAT ALL DISTINCT FEATURE OF CUSTOM ALL
CLEAR LINE OF LOCALITY EVADE PERCEPTION AND BAFFLE RESEARCH
IT MUST
SUFFICE TO KNOW THAT THE WORLD THEN EXISTED THAT MEN PEOPLED IT THAT
MAN'S NATURE WITH ITS PASSIONS SYMPATHIES PAINS AND PLEASURES
INFORMED THE PLANET AND GAVE IT SOUL
A CERTAIN TRIBE COLONIZED A CERTAIN SPOT ON THE GLOBE OF WHAT RACE THIS
TRIBE UNKNOWN IN WHAT REGION THAT SPOT UNTOLD
WE USUALLY THINK OF
THE EAST WHEN WE REFER TO TRANSACTIONS OF THAT DATE BUT WHO SHALL
DECLARE THAT THERE WAS NO LIFE IN THE WEST THE SOUTH THE NORTH WHAT
IS TO DISPROVE THAT THIS TRIBE INSTEAD OF CAMPING UNDER PALM GROVES IN
ASIA WANDERED BENEATH ISLAND OAK WOODS ROOTED IN OUR OWN SEAS OF
EUROPE
IT IS NO SANDY PLAIN NOR ANY CIRCUMSCRIBED AND SCANT OASIS I SEEM TO
REALIZE
A FOREST VALLEY WITH ROCKY SIDES AND BROWN PROFUNDITY OF
SHADE FORMED BY TREE CROWDING ON TREE DESCENDS DEEP BEFORE ME
HERE
INDEED DWELL HUMAN BEINGS BUT SO FEW AND IN ALLEYS SO THICK BRANCHED
AND OVERARCHED THEY ARE NEITHER HEARD NOR SEEN
ARE THEY SAVAGE
DOUBTLESS
THEY LIVE BY THE CROOK AND THE BOW HALF SHEPHERDS HALF
HUNTERS THEIR FLOCKS WANDER WILD AS THEIR PREY
ARE THEY HAPPY NO NOT
MORE HAPPY THAN WE ARE AT THIS DAY
ARE THEY GOOD NO NOT BETTER THAN
OURSELVES
THEIR NATURE IS OUR NATURE HUMAN BOTH
THERE IS ONE IN THIS
TRIBE TOO OFTEN MISERABLE A CHILD BEREAVED OF BOTH PARENTS
NONE CARES
FOR THIS CHILD
SHE IS FED SOMETIMES BUT OFTENER FORGOTTEN
A HUT
RARELY RECEIVES HER THE HOLLOW TREE AND CHILL CAVERN ARE HER HOME
FORSAKEN LOST AND WANDERING SHE LIVES MORE WITH THE WILD BEAST AND
BIRD THAN WITH HER OWN KIND
HUNGER AND COLD ARE HER COMRADES SADNESS
HOVERS OVER AND SOLITUDE BESETS HER ROUND
UNHEEDED AND UNVALUED SHE
SHOULD DIE BUT SHE BOTH LIVES AND GROWS
THE GREEN WILDERNESS NURSES
HER AND BECOMES TO HER A MOTHER FEEDS HER ON JUICY BERRY ON
SACCHARINE ROOT AND NUT
THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE AIR OF THIS CLIME WHICH FOSTERS LIFE KINDLY
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING TOO IN ITS DEWS WHICH HEALS WITH SOVEREIGN
BALM
ITS GENTLE SEASONS EXAGGERATE NO PASSION NO SENSE ITS
TEMPERATURE TENDS TO HARMONY ITS BREEZES YOU WOULD SAY BRING DOWN
FROM HEAVEN THE GERM OF PURE THOUGHT AND PURER FEELING
NOT GROTESQUELY
FANTASTIC ARE THE FORMS OF CLIFF AND FOLIAGE NOT VIOLENTLY VIVID THE
COLOURING OF FLOWER AND BIRD
IN ALL THE GRANDEUR OF THESE FORESTS
THERE IS REPOSE IN ALL THEIR FRESHNESS THERE IS TENDERNESS
THE GENTLE CHARM VOUCHSAFED TO FLOWER AND TREE BESTOWED ON DEER AND
DOVE HAS NOT BEEN DENIED TO THE HUMAN NURSLING
ALL SOLITARY SHE HAS
SPRUNG UP STRAIGHT AND GRACEFUL
NATURE CAST HER FEATURES IN A FINE
MOULD THEY HAVE MATURED IN THEIR PURE ACCURATE FIRST LINES UNALTERED
BY THE SHOCKS OF DISEASE
NO FIERCE DRY BLAST HAS DEALT RUDELY WITH THE
SURFACE OF HER FRAME NO BURNING SUN HAS CRISPED OR WITHERED HER
TRESSES
HER FORM GLEAMS IVORY WHITE THROUGH THE TREES HER HAIR FLOWS
PLENTEOUS LONG AND GLOSSY HER EYES NOT DAZZLED BY VERTICAL FIRES
BEAM IN THE SHADE LARGE AND OPEN AND FULL AND DEWY
ABOVE THOSE EYES
WHEN THE BREEZE BARES HER FOREHEAD SHINES AN EXPANSE FAIR AND AMPLE A
CLEAR CANDID PAGE WHEREON KNOWLEDGE SHOULD KNOWLEDGE EVER COME MIGHT
WRITE A GOLDEN RECORD
YOU SEE IN THE DESOLATE YOUNG SAVAGE NOTHING
VICIOUS OR VACANT
SHE HAUNTS THE WOOD HARMLESS AND THOUGHTFUL THOUGH
OF WHAT ONE SO UNTAUGHT CAN THINK IT IS NOT EASY TO DIVINE
ON THE EVENING OF ONE SUMMER DAY BEFORE THE FLOOD BEING UTTERLY
ALONE FOR SHE HAD LOST ALL TRACE OF HER TRIBE WHO HAD WANDERED LEAGUES
AWAY SHE KNEW NOT WHERE SHE WENT UP FROM THE VALE TO WATCH DAY TAKE
LEAVE AND NIGHT ARRIVE
A CRAG OVERSPREAD BY A TREE WAS HER STATION
THE
OAK ROOTS TURFED AND MOSSED GAVE A SEAT THE OAK BOUGHS THICK LEAVED
WOVE A CANOPY
SLOW AND GRAND THE DAY WITHDREW PASSING IN PURPLE FIRE AND PARTING TO
THE FAREWELL OF A WILD LOW CHORUS FROM THE WOODLANDS
THEN NIGHT
ENTERED QUIET AS DEATH
THE WIND FELL THE BIRDS CEASED SINGING
NOW
EVERY NEST HELD HAPPY MATES AND HART AND HIND SLUMBERED BLISSFULLY SAFE
IN THEIR LAIR
THE GIRL SAT HER BODY STILL HER SOUL ASTIR OCCUPIED HOWEVER RATHER
IN FEELING THAN IN THINKING IN WISHING THAN HOPING IN IMAGINING THAN
PROJECTING
SHE FELT THE WORLD THE SKY THE NIGHT BOUNDLESSLY MIGHTY
OF ALL THINGS HERSELF SEEMED TO HERSELF THE CENTRE A SMALL FORGOTTEN
ATOM OF LIFE A SPARK OF SOUL EMITTED INADVERTENT FROM THE GREAT
CREATIVE SOURCE AND NOW BURNING UNMARKED TO WASTE IN THE HEART OF A
BLACK HOLLOW
SHE ASKED WAS SHE THUS TO BURN OUT AND PERISH HER LIVING
LIGHT DOING NO GOOD NEVER SEEN NEVER NEEDED A STAR IN AN ELSE
STARLESS FIRMAMENT WHICH NOR SHEPHERD NOR WANDERER NOR SAGE NOR
PRIEST TRACKED AS A GUIDE OR READ AS A PROPHECY COULD THIS BE SHE
DEMANDED WHEN THE FLAME OF HER INTELLIGENCE BURNED SO VIVID WHEN HER
LIFE BEAT SO TRUE AND REAL AND POTENT WHEN SOMETHING WITHIN HER
STIRRED DISQUIETED AND RESTLESSLY ASSERTED A GOD GIVEN STRENGTH FOR
WHICH IT INSISTED SHE SHOULD FIND EXERCISE
SHE GAZED ABROAD ON HEAVEN AND EVENING
HEAVEN AND EVENING GAZED BACK ON
HER
SHE BENT DOWN SEARCHING BANK HILL RIVER SPREAD DIM BELOW
ALL
SHE QUESTIONED RESPONDED BY ORACLES
SHE HEARD SHE WAS IMPRESSED BUT
SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
ABOVE HER HEAD SHE RAISED HER HANDS JOINED
TOGETHER
GUIDANCE HELP COMFORT COME WAS HER CRY
THERE WAS NO VOICE NOR ANY THAT ANSWERED
SHE WAITED KNEELING STEADFASTLY LOOKING UP
YONDER SKY WAS SEALED THE
SOLEMN STARS SHONE ALIEN AND REMOTE
AT LAST ONE OVERSTRETCHED CHORD OF HER AGONY SLACKED SHE THOUGHT
SOMETHING ABOVE RELENTED SHE FELT AS IF SOMETHING FAR ROUND DREW
NIGHER SHE HEARD AS IF SILENCE SPOKE
THERE WAS NO LANGUAGE NO WORD
ONLY A TONE
AGAIN A FINE FULL LOFTY TONE A DEEP SOFT SOUND LIKE A STORM
WHISPERING MADE TWILIGHT UNDULATE
ONCE MORE PROFOUNDER NEARER CLEARER IT ROLLED HARMONIOUS
YET AGAIN A DISTINCT VOICE PASSED BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
EVA
IF EVA WERE NOT THIS WOMAN'S NAME SHE HAD NONE
SHE ROSE
HERE AM I
EVA
O NIGHT IT CAN BE BUT NIGHT THAT SPEAKS I AM HERE
THE VOICE DESCENDING REACHED EARTH
EVA

I TAKE FROM THY VISION DARKNESS I LOOSEN
FROM THY FACULTIES FETTERS I LEVEL IN THY PATH OBSTACLES I WITH MY
PRESENCE FILL VACANCY
I CLAIM AS MINE THE LOST ATOM OF LIFE

MYSELF THE SPARK OF SOUL BURNING HERETOFORE FORGOTTEN
O TAKE ME O CLAIM ME THIS IS A GOD
THIS IS A SON OF GOD ONE WHO FEELS HIMSELF IN THE PORTION OF LIFE THAT
STIRS YOU
HE IS SUFFERED TO RECLAIM HIS OWN AND SO TO FOSTER AND AID
THAT IT SHALL NOT PERISH HOPELESS
A SON OF GOD AM I INDEED CHOSEN
THOU ONLY IN THIS LAND
I SAW THEE THAT THOU WERT FAIR I KNEW THEE
THAT THOU WERT MINE
TO ME IT IS GIVEN TO RESCUE TO SUSTAIN TO CHERISH
MINE OWN
ACKNOWLEDGE IN ME THAT SERAPH ON EARTH NAMED GENIUS
MY GLORIOUS BRIDEGROOM TRUE DAYSPRING FROM ON HIGH ALL I WOULD HAVE

THOU ART

GODBORN TAKE ME THY BRIDE
UNHUMBLED I CAN TAKE WHAT IS MINE
DID I NOT GIVE FROM THE ALTAR THE
VERY FLAME WHICH LIT EVA'S BEING COME AGAIN INTO THE HEAVEN WHENCE THOU
WERT SENT
THAT PRESENCE INVISIBLE BUT MIGHTY GATHERED HER IN LIKE A LAMB TO THE
FOLD THAT VOICE SOFT BUT ALL PERVADING VIBRATED THROUGH HER HEART
LIKE MUSIC
HER EYE RECEIVED NO IMAGE AND YET A SENSE VISITED HER
VISION AND HER BRAIN AS OF THE SERENITY OF STAINLESS AIR THE POWER OF
SOVEREIGN SEAS THE MAJESTY OF MARCHING STARS THE ENERGY OF COLLIDING
ELEMENTS THE ROOTED ENDURANCE OF HILLS WIDE BASED AND ABOVE ALL AS
OF THE LUSTRE OF HEROIC BEAUTY RUSHING VICTORIOUS ON THE NIGHT
VANQUISHING ITS SHADOWS LIKE A DIVINER SUN
SUCH WAS THE BRIDAL HOUR OF GENIUS AND HUMANITY
WHO SHALL REHEARSE THE
TALE OF THEIR AFTER UNION WHO SHALL DEPICT ITS BLISS AND BALE WHO
SHALL TELL HOW HE BETWEEN WHOM AND THE WOMAN GOD PUT ENMITY FORGED
DEADLY PLOTS TO BREAK THE BOND OR DEFILE ITS PURITY WHO SHALL RECORD
THE LONG STRIFE BETWEEN SERPENT AND SERAPH HOW STILL THE FATHER OF
LIES INSINUATED EVIL INTO GOOD PRIDE INTO WISDOM GROSSNESS INTO GLORY
PAIN INTO BLISS POISON INTO PASSION HOW THE DREADLESS ANGEL DEFIED
RESISTED AND REPELLED HOW AGAIN AND AGAIN HE REFINED THE POLLUTED CUP
EXALTED THE DEBASED EMOTION RECTIFIED THE PERVERTED IMPULSE DETECTED
THE LURKING VENOM BAFFLED THE FRONTLESS TEMPTATION PURIFIED
JUSTIFIED WATCHED AND WITHSTOOD HOW BY HIS PATIENCE BY HIS
STRENGTH BY THAT UNUTTERABLE EXCELLENCE HE HELD FROM GOD HIS
ORIGIN THIS FAITHFUL SERAPH FOUGHT FOR HUMANITY A GOOD FIGHT THROUGH
TIME AND WHEN TIME'S COURSE CLOSED AND DEATH WAS ENCOUNTERED AT THE
END BARRING WITH FLESHLESS ARM THE PORTALS OF ETERNITY HOW GENIUS
STILL HELD CLOSE HIS DYING BRIDE SUSTAINED HER THROUGH THE AGONY OF THE
PASSAGE BORE HER TRIUMPHANT INTO HIS OWN HOME HEAVEN RESTORED HER
REDEEMED TO JEHOVAH HER MAKER AND AT LAST BEFORE ANGEL AND
ARCHANGEL CROWNED HER WITH THE CROWN OF IMMORTALITY
WHO SHALL OF THESE THINGS WRITE THE CHRONICLE
I NEVER COULD CORRECT THAT COMPOSITION OBSERVED SHIRLEY AS MOORE
CONCLUDED
YOUR CENSOR PENCIL SCORED IT WITH CONDEMNATORY LINES WHOSE
SIGNIFICATION I STROVE VAINLY TO FATHOM
SHE HAD TAKEN A CRAYON FROM THE TUTOR'S DESK AND WAS DRAWING LITTLE
LEAVES FRAGMENTS OF PILLARS BROKEN CROSSES ON THE MARGIN OF THE BOOK
FRENCH MAY BE HALF FORGOTTEN BUT THE HABITS OF THE FRENCH LESSON ARE
RETAINED I SEE SAID LOUIS
MY BOOKS WOULD NOW AS ERST BE UNSAFE
WITH YOU
MY NEWLY BOUND ST
PIERRE WOULD SOON BE LIKE MY RACINE MISS
KEELDAR HER MARK TRACED ON EVERY PAGE
SHIRLEY DROPPED HER CRAYON AS IF IT BURNED HER FINGERS
TELL ME WHAT WERE THE FAULTS OF THAT DEVOIR SHE ASKED
WERE THEY
GRAMMATICAL ERRORS OR DID YOU OBJECT TO THE SUBSTANCE
I NEVER SAID THAT THE LINES I DREW WERE INDICATIONS OF FAULTS AT ALL
YOU WOULD HAVE IT THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE AND I REFRAINED FROM
CONTRADICTION
WHAT ELSE DID THEY DENOTE
NO MATTER NOW
MR
MOORE CRIED HENRY MAKE SHIRLEY REPEAT SOME OF THE PIECES SHE
USED TO SAY SO WELL BY HEART
IF I ASK FOR ANY IT WILL BE 'LE CHEVAL DOMPT SAID MOORE TRIMMING
WITH HIS PENKNIFE THE PENCIL MISS KEELDAR HAD WORN TO A STUMP
SHE TURNED ASIDE HER HEAD THE NECK THE CLEAR CHEEK FORSAKEN BY THEIR
NATURAL VEIL WERE SEEN TO FLUSH WARM
AH SHE HAS NOT FORGOTTEN YOU SEE SIR SAID HENRY EXULTANT
SHE
KNOWS HOW NAUGHTY SHE WAS
A SMILE WHICH SHIRLEY WOULD NOT PERMIT TO EXPAND MADE HER LIP TREMBLE
SHE BENT HER FACE AND HID IT HALF WITH HER ARMS HALF IN HER CURLS
WHICH AS SHE STOOPED FELL LOOSE AGAIN
CERTAINLY I WAS A REBEL SHE
ANSWERED
A REBEL REPEATED HENRY
YES YOU AND PAPA HAD QUARRELLED TERRIBLY
AND YOU SET BOTH HIM AND MAMMA AND MRS
PRYOR AND EVERYBODY AT
DEFIANCE
YOU SAID HE HAD INSULTED YOU
HE HAD INSULTED ME INTERPOSED SHIRLEY
AND YOU WANTED TO LEAVE SYMPSON GROVE DIRECTLY
YOU PACKED YOUR THINGS
UP AND PAPA THREW THEM OUT OF YOUR TRUNK MAMMA CRIED MRS
PRYOR
CRIED THEY BOTH STOOD WRINGING THEIR HANDS BEGGING YOU TO BE PATIENT
AND YOU KNELT ON THE FLOOR WITH YOUR THINGS AND YOUR UP TURNED BOX
BEFORE YOU LOOKING SHIRLEY LOOKING WHY IN ONE OF YOUR PASSIONS
YOUR FEATURES IN SUCH PASSIONS ARE NOT DISTORTED THEY ARE FIXED BUT
QUITE BEAUTIFUL
YOU SCARCELY LOOK ANGRY ONLY RESOLUTE AND IN A
CERTAIN HASTE YET ONE FEELS THAT AT SUCH TIMES AN OBSTACLE CAST ACROSS
YOUR PATH WOULD BE SPLIT AS WITH LIGHTNING
PAPA LOST HEART AND CALLED
MR
MOORE
ENOUGH HENRY
NO IT IS NOT ENOUGH
I HARDLY KNOW HOW MR
MOORE MANAGED EXCEPT THAT
I RECOLLECT HE SUGGESTED TO PAPA THAT AGITATION WOULD BRING ON HIS GOUT
AND THEN HE SPOKE QUIETLY TO THE LADIES AND GOT THEM AWAY AND
AFTERWARDS HE SAID TO YOU MISS SHIRLEY THAT IT WAS OF NO USE TALKING
OR LECTURING NOW BUT THAT THE TEA THINGS WERE JUST BROUGHT INTO THE
SCHOOLROOM AND HE WAS VERY THIRSTY AND HE WOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD
LEAVE YOUR PACKING FOR THE PRESENT AND COME AND MAKE A CUP OF TEA FOR
HIM AND ME
YOU CAME YOU WOULD NOT TALK AT FIRST BUT SOON YOU SOFTENED
AND GREW CHEERFUL
MR
MOORE BEGAN TO TELL US ABOUT THE CONTINENT THE
WAR AND BONAPARTE SUBJECTS WE WERE BOTH FOND OF LISTENING TO
AFTER
TEA HE SAID WE SHOULD NEITHER OF US LEAVE HIM THAT EVENING HE WOULD NOT
LET US STRAY OUT OF HIS SIGHT LEST WE SHOULD AGAIN GET INTO MISCHIEF
WE SAT ONE ON EACH SIDE OF HIM
WE WERE SO HAPPY
I NEVER PASSED SO
PLEASANT AN EVENING
THE NEXT DAY HE GAVE YOU MISSY A LECTURE OF AN
HOUR AND WOUND IT UP BY MARKING YOU A PIECE TO LEARN IN BOSSUET AS A
PUNISHMENT LESSON 'LE CHEVAL DOMPT YOU LEARNED IT INSTEAD OF PACKING
UP SHIRLEY
WE HEARD NO MORE OF YOUR RUNNING AWAY
MR
MOORE USED TO
TEASE YOU ON THE SUBJECT FOR A YEAR AFTERWARDS
SHE NEVER SAID A LESSON WITH GREATER SPIRIT SUBJOINED MOORE
SHE
THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME GAVE ME THE TREAT OF HEARING MY NATIVE TONGUE
SPOKEN WITHOUT ACCENT BY AN ENGLISH GIRL
SHE WAS AS SWEET AS SUMMER CHERRIES FOR A MONTH AFTERWARDS STRUCK IN
HENRY A GOOD HEARTY QUARREL ALWAYS LEFT SHIRLEY'S TEMPER BETTER THAN
IT FOUND IT
YOU TALK OF ME AS IF I WERE NOT PRESENT OBSERVED MISS KEELDAR WHO
HAD NOT YET LIFTED HER FACE
ARE YOU SURE YOU ARE PRESENT ASKED MOORE
THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS
SINCE MY ARRIVAL HERE WHEN I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO INQUIRE OF THE LADY OF
FIELDHEAD IF SHE KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF MY FORMER PUPIL
SHE IS HERE NOW
I SEE HER AND HUMBLE ENOUGH BUT I WOULD NEITHER ADVISE HARRY NOR
OTHERS TO BELIEVE TOO IMPLICITLY IN THE HUMILITY WHICH ONE MOMENT CAN
HIDE ITS BLUSHING FACE LIKE A MODEST LITTLE CHILD AND THE NEXT LIFT IT
PALE AND LOFTY AS A MARBLE JUNO
ONE MAN IN TIMES OF OLD IT IS SAID IMPARTED VITALITY TO THE STATUE HE
HAD CHISELLED OTHERS MAY HAVE THE CONTRARY GIFT OF TURNING LIFE TO
STONE
MOORE PAUSED ON THIS OBSERVATION BEFORE HE REPLIED TO IT
HIS LOOK AT
ONCE STRUCK AND MEDITATIVE SAID A STRANGE PHRASE WHAT MAY IT MEAN
HE TURNED IT OVER IN HIS MIND WITH THOUGHT DEEP AND SLOW AS SOME
GERMAN PONDERING METAPHYSICS
YOU MEAN HE SAID AT LAST THAT SOME MEN INSPIRE REPUGNANCE AND SO
CHILL THE KIND HEART
INGENIOUS RESPONDED SHIRLEY
IF THE INTERPRETATION PLEASES YOU YOU
ARE WELCOME TO HOLD IT VALID
I DON'T CARE
AND WITH THAT SHE RAISED HER HEAD LOFTY IN LOOK AND STATUE LIKE IN HUE
AS LOUIS HAD DESCRIBED IT
BEHOLD THE METAMORPHOSIS HE SAID SCARCE IMAGINED ERE IT IS
REALIZED A LOWLY NYMPH DEVELOPS TO AN INACCESSIBLE GODDESS
BUT HENRY
MUST NOT BE DISAPPOINTED OF HIS RECITATION AND OLYMPIA WILL DEIGN TO
OBLIGE HIM
LET US BEGIN
I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE VERY FIRST LINE
WHICH I HAVE NOT
MY MEMORY IF A SLOW IS A RETENTIVE ONE
I ACQUIRE
DELIBERATELY BOTH KNOWLEDGE AND LIKING
THE ACQUISITION GROWS INTO MY
BRAIN AND THE SENTIMENT INTO MY BREAST AND IT IS NOT AS THE
RAPID SPRINGING PRODUCE WHICH HAVING NO ROOT IN ITSELF FLOURISHES
VERDUROUS ENOUGH FOR A TIME BUT TOO SOON FALLS WITHERED AWAY
ATTENTION HENRY MISS KEELDAR CONSENTS TO FAVOUR YOU
'VOYEZ CE CHEVAL
ARDENT ET IMPTUEUX SO IT COMMENCES
MISS KEELDAR DID CONSENT TO MAKE THE EFFORT BUT SHE SOON STOPPED
UNLESS I HEARD THE WHOLE REPEATED I CANNOT CONTINUE IT SHE SAID
YET IT WAS QUICKLY LEARNED 'SOON GAINED SOON GONE MORALIZED THE
TUTOR
HE RECITED THE PASSAGE DELIBERATELY ACCURATELY WITH SLOW
IMPRESSIVE EMPHASIS
SHIRLEY BY DEGREES INCLINED HER EAR AS HE WENT ON
HER FACE BEFORE
TURNED FROM HIM RE TURNED TOWARDS HIM
WHEN HE CEASED SHE TOOK THE
WORD UP AS IF FROM HIS LIPS SHE TOOK HIS VERY TONE SHE SEIZED HIS VERY
ACCENT SHE DELIVERED THE PERIODS AS HE HAD DELIVERED THEM SHE
REPRODUCED HIS MANNER HIS PRONUNCIATION HIS EXPRESSION
IT WAS NOW HER TURN TO PETITION
RECALL 'LE SONGE D'ATHALIE SHE ENTREATED AND SAY IT
HE SAID IT FOR HER
SHE TOOK IT FROM HIM SHE FOUND LIVELY EXCITEMENT IN
THE PLEASURE OF MAKING HIS LANGUAGE HER OWN
SHE ASKED FOR FURTHER
INDULGENCE ALL THE OLD SCHOOL PIECES WERE REVIVED AND WITH THEM
SHIRLEY'S OLD SCHOOL DAYS
HE HAD GONE THROUGH SOME OF THE BEST PASSAGES OF RACINE AND CORNEILLE
AND THEN HAD HEARD THE ECHO OF HIS OWN DEEP TONES IN THE GIRL'S VOICE
THAT MODULATED ITSELF FAITHFULLY ON HIS
LE CHNE ET LE ROSEAU THAT
MOST BEAUTIFUL OF LA FONTAINE'S FABLES HAD BEEN RECITED WELL RECITED
BY THE TUTOR AND THE PUPIL HAD ANIMATEDLY AVAILED HERSELF OF THE
LESSON
PERHAPS A SIMULTANEOUS FEELING SEIZED THEM NOW THAT THEIR
ENTHUSIASM HAD KINDLED TO A GLOW WHICH THE SLIGHT FUEL OF FRENCH POETRY
NO LONGER SUFFICED TO FEED PERHAPS THEY LONGED FOR A TRUNK OF ENGLISH
OAK TO BE THROWN AS A YULE LOG TO THE DEVOURING FLAME
MOORE OBSERVED
AND THESE ARE OUR BEST PIECES AND WE HAVE NOTHING MORE DRAMATIC
NERVOUS NATURAL
AND THEN HE SMILED AND WAS SILENT
HIS WHOLE NATURE SEEMED SERENELY
ALIGHT
HE STOOD ON THE HEARTH LEANING HIS ELBOW ON THE MANTELPIECE
MUSING NOT UNBLISSFULLY
TWILIGHT WAS CLOSING ON THE DIMINISHED AUTUMN DAY
THE SCHOOLROOM
WINDOWS DARKENED WITH CREEPING PLANTS FROM WHICH NO HIGH OCTOBER WINDS
HAD AS YET SWEPT THE SERE FOLIAGE ADMITTED SCARCE A GLEAM OF SKY BUT
THE FIRE GAVE LIGHT ENOUGH TO TALK BY
AND NOW LOUIS MOORE ADDRESSED HIS PUPIL IN FRENCH AND SHE ANSWERED AT
FIRST WITH LAUGHING HESITATION AND IN BROKEN PHRASE
MOORE ENCOURAGED
WHILE HE CORRECTED HER
HENRY JOINED IN THE LESSON THE TWO SCHOLARS
STOOD OPPOSITE THE MASTER THEIR ARMS ROUND EACH OTHER'S WAISTS
TARTAR
WHO LONG SINCE HAD CRAVED AND OBTAINED ADMISSION SAT SAGELY IN THE
CENTRE OF THE RUG STARING AT THE BLAZE WHICH BURST FITFUL FROM MORSELS
OF COAL AMONG THE RED CINDERS
THE GROUP WERE HAPPY ENOUGH BUT
PLEASURES ARE LIKE POPPIES SPREAD
YOU SEIZE THE FLOWER ITS BLOOM IS SHED
THE DULL RUMBLING SOUND OF WHEELS WAS HEARD ON THE PAVEMENT IN THE
YARD
IT IS THE CARRIAGE RETURNED SAID SHIRLEY AND DINNER MUST BE JUST
READY AND I AM NOT DRESSED
A SERVANT CAME IN WITH MR
MOORE'S CANDLE AND TEA FOR THE TUTOR AND HIS
PUPIL USUALLY DINED AT LUNCHEON TIME
MR
SYMPSON AND THE LADIES ARE RETURNED SHE SAID AND SIR PHILIP
NUNNELY IS WITH THEM
HOW YOU DID START AND HOW YOUR HAND TREMBLED SHIRLEY SAID HENRY
WHEN THE MAID HAD CLOSED THE SHUTTER AND WAS GONE
BUT I KNOW
WHY DON'T YOU MR
MOORE I KNOW WHAT PAPA INTENDS
HE IS A LITTLE UGLY
MAN THAT SIR PHILIP
I WISH HE HAD NOT COME
I WISH SISTERS AND ALL OF
THEM HAD STAYED AT DE WALDEN HALL TO DINE SHIRLEY SHOULD ONCE MORE
HAVE MADE TEA FOR YOU AND ME MR
MOORE AND WE WOULD HAVE HAD A HAPPY
EVENING OF IT
MOORE WAS LOCKING UP HIS DESK AND PUTTING AWAY HIS ST
PIERRE
THAT WAS
YOUR PLAN WAS IT MY BOY
DON'T YOU APPROVE IT SIR
I APPROVE NOTHING UTOPIAN
LOOK LIFE IN ITS IRON FACE STARE REALITY
OUT OF ITS BRASSY COUNTENANCE
MAKE THE TEA HENRY I SHALL BE BACK IN A
MINUTE
HE LEFT THE ROOM SO DID SHIRLEY BY ANOTHER DOOR
CHAPTER XXVIII
PHBE
SHIRLEY PROBABLY GOT ON PLEASANTLY WITH SIR PHILIP THAT EVENING FOR THE
NEXT MORNING SHE CAME DOWN IN ONE OF HER BEST MOODS
WHO WILL TAKE A WALK WITH ME SHE ASKED AFTER BREAKFAST
ISABELLA
AND GERTRUDE WILL YOU
SO RARE WAS SUCH AN INVITATION FROM MISS KEELDAR TO HER FEMALE COUSINS
THAT THEY HESITATED BEFORE THEY ACCEPTED IT
THEIR MAMMA HOWEVER
SIGNIFYING ACQUIESCENCE IN THE PROJECT THEY FETCHED THEIR BONNETS AND
THE TRIO SET OUT
IT DID NOT SUIT THESE THREE YOUNG PERSONS TO BE THROWN MUCH TOGETHER
MISS KEELDAR LIKED THE SOCIETY OF FEW LADIES INDEED SHE HAD A CORDIAL
PLEASURE IN THAT OF NONE EXCEPT MRS
PRYOR AND CAROLINE HELSTONE
SHE
WAS CIVIL KIND ATTENTIVE EVEN TO HER COUSINS BUT STILL SHE USUALLY
HAD LITTLE TO SAY TO THEM
IN THE SUNNY MOOD OF THIS PARTICULAR MORNING
SHE CONTRIVED TO ENTERTAIN EVEN THE MISSES SYMPSON
WITHOUT DEVIATING
FROM HER WONTED RULE OF DISCUSSING WITH THEM ONLY ORDINARY THEMES SHE
IMPARTED TO THESE THEMES AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST THE SPARKLE OF HER
SPIRIT GLANCED ALONG HER PHRASES
WHAT MADE HER SO JOYOUS ALL THE CAUSE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HERSELF
THE
DAY WAS NOT BRIGHT
IT WAS DIM A PALE WANING AUTUMN DAY
THE WALKS
THROUGH THE DUN WOODS WERE DAMP THE ATMOSPHERE WAS HEAVY THE SKY
OVERCAST AND YET IT SEEMED THAT IN SHIRLEY'S HEART LIVED ALL THE LIGHT
AND AZURE OF ITALY AS ALL ITS FERVOUR LAUGHED IN HER GRAY ENGLISH EYE
SOME DIRECTIONS NECESSARY TO BE GIVEN TO HER FOREMAN JOHN DELAYED HER
BEHIND HER COUSINS AS THEY NEARED FIELDHEAD ON THEIR RETURN
PERHAPS AN
INTERVAL OF TWENTY MINUTES ELAPSED BETWEEN HER SEPARATION FROM THEM AND
HER RE ENTRANCE INTO THE HOUSE
IN THE MEANTIME SHE HAD SPOKEN TO JOHN
AND THEN SHE HAD LINGERED IN THE LANE AT THE GATE
A SUMMONS TO
LUNCHEON CALLED HER IN
SHE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM THE MEAL AND WENT
UPSTAIRS
IS NOT SHIRLEY COMING TO LUNCHEON ASKED ISABELLA
SHE SAID SHE WAS
HUNGRY
AN HOUR AFTER AS SHE DID NOT QUIT HER CHAMBER ONE OF HER COUSINS WENT
TO SEEK HER THERE
SHE WAS FOUND SITTING AT THE FOOT OF THE BED HER
HEAD RESTING ON HER HAND SHE LOOKED QUITE PALE VERY THOUGHTFUL ALMOST
SAD
YOU ARE NOT ILL WAS THE QUESTION PUT
A LITTLE SICK REPLIED MISS KEELDAR
CERTAINLY SHE WAS NOT A LITTLE CHANGED FROM WHAT SHE HAD BEEN TWO HOURS
BEFORE
THIS CHANGE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THOSE THREE WORDS EXPLAINED NO
OTHERWISE THIS CHANGE WHENCESOEVER SPRINGING EFFECTED IN A BRIEF TEN
MINUTES PASSED LIKE NO LIGHT SUMMER CLOUD
SHE TALKED WHEN SHE JOINED
HER FRIENDS AT DINNER TALKED AS USUAL
SHE REMAINED WITH THEM DURING
THE EVENING
WHEN AGAIN QUESTIONED RESPECTING HER HEALTH SHE DECLARED
HERSELF PERFECTLY RECOVERED
IT HAD BEEN A MERE PASSING FAINTNESS A
MOMENTARY SENSATION NOT WORTH A THOUGHT YET IT WAS FELT THERE WAS A
DIFFERENCE IN SHIRLEY
THE NEXT DAY THE DAY THE WEEK THE FORTNIGHT AFTER THIS NEW AND
PECULIAR SHADOW LINGERED ON THE COUNTENANCE IN THE MANNER OF MISS
KEELDAR
A STRANGE QUIETUDE SETTLED OVER HER LOOK HER MOVEMENTS HER
VERY VOICE
THE ALTERATION WAS NOT SO MARKED AS TO COURT OR PERMIT
FREQUENT QUESTIONING YET IT WAS THERE AND IT WOULD NOT PASS AWAY
IT
HUNG OVER HER LIKE A CLOUD WHICH NO BREEZE COULD STIR OR DISPERSE
SOON
IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT TO NOTICE THIS CHANGE WAS TO ANNOY HER
FIRST SHE
SHRANK FROM REMARK AND IF PERSISTED IN SHE WITH HER OWN PECULIAR
HAUTEUR REPELLED IT
WAS SHE ILL THE REPLY CAME WITH DECISION
I AM NOT
DID ANYTHING WEIGH ON HER MIND HAD ANYTHING HAPPENED TO AFFECT HER
SPIRITS
SHE SCORNFULLY RIDICULED THE IDEA
WHAT DID THEY MEAN BY SPIRITS SHE
HAD NO SPIRITS BLACK OR WHITE BLUE OR GRAY TO AFFECT
SOMETHING MUST BE THE MATTER SHE WAS SO ALTERED
SHE SUPPOSED SHE HAD A RIGHT TO ALTER AT HER EASE
SHE KNEW SHE WAS
PLAINER
IF IT SUITED HER TO GROW UGLY WHY NEED OTHERS FRET THEMSELVES
ON THE SUBJECT
THERE MUST BE A CAUSE FOR THE CHANGE
WHAT WAS IT
SHE PEREMPTORILY REQUESTED TO BE LET ALONE
THEN SHE WOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO APPEAR QUITE GAY AND SHE SEEMED
INDIGNANT AT HERSELF THAT SHE COULD NOT PERFECTLY SUCCEED
BRIEF
SELF SPURNING EPITHETS BURST FROM HER LIPS WHEN ALONE
FOOL COWARD
SHE WOULD TERM HERSELF
POLTROON SHE WOULD SAY IF YOU MUST TREMBLE
TREMBLE IN SECRET QUAIL WHERE NO EYE SEES YOU
HOW DARE YOU SHE WOULD ASK HERSELF HOW DARE YOU SHOW YOUR WEAKNESS
AND BETRAY YOUR IMBECILE ANXIETIES SHAKE THEM OFF RISE ABOVE THEM
IF
YOU CANNOT DO THIS HIDE THEM
AND TO HIDE THEM SHE DID HER BEST
SHE ONCE MORE BECAME RESOLUTELY
LIVELY IN COMPANY
WHEN WEARY OF EFFORT AND FORCED TO RELAX SHE SOUGHT
SOLITUDE NOT THE SOLITUDE OF HER CHAMBER SHE REFUSED TO MOPE SHUT UP
BETWEEN FOUR WALLS BUT THAT WILDER SOLITUDE WHICH LIES OUT OF DOORS
AND WHICH SHE COULD CHASE MOUNTED ON ZO HER MARE
SHE TOOK LONG RIDES
OF HALF A DAY
HER UNCLE DISAPPROVED BUT HE DARED NOT REMONSTRATE
IT
WAS NEVER PLEASANT TO FACE SHIRLEY'S ANGER EVEN WHEN SHE WAS HEALTHY
AND GAY BUT NOW THAT HER FACE SHOWED THIN AND HER LARGE EYE LOOKED
HOLLOW THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE DARKENING OF THAT FACE AND KINDLING
OF THAT EYE WHICH TOUCHED AS WELL AS ALARMED
TO ALL COMPARATIVE STRANGERS WHO UNCONSCIOUS OF THE ALTERATIONS IN HER
SPIRITS COMMENTED ON THE ALTERATION IN HER LOOKS SHE HAD ONE REPLY
I AM PERFECTLY WELL I HAVE NOT AN AILMENT
AND HEALTH INDEED SHE MUST HAVE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BEAR THE EXPOSURE
TO THE WEATHER SHE NOW ENCOUNTERED
WET OR FAIR CALM OR STORM SHE TOOK
HER DAILY RIDE OVER STILBRO' MOOR TARTAR KEEPING UP AT HER SIDE WITH
HIS WOLF LIKE GALLOP LONG AND UNTIRING
TWICE THREE TIMES THE EYES OF GOSSIPS THOSE EYES WHICH ARE
EVERYWHERE IN THE CLOSET AND ON THE HILL TOP NOTICED THAT INSTEAD OF
TURNING ON RUSHEDGE THE TOP RIDGE OF STILBRO' MOOR SHE RODE FORWARDS
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOWN
SCOUTS WERE NOT WANTING TO MARK HER DESTINATION
THERE
IT WAS ASCERTAINED THAT SHE ALIGHTED AT THE DOOR OF ONE MR
PEARSON HALL A SOLICITOR RELATED TO THE VICAR OF NUNNELY
THIS
GENTLEMAN AND HIS ANCESTORS HAD BEEN THE AGENTS OF THE KEELDAR FAMILY
FOR GENERATIONS BACK
SOME PEOPLE AFFIRMED THAT MISS KEELDAR WAS BECOME
INVOLVED IN BUSINESS SPECULATIONS CONNECTED WITH HOLLOW'S MILL THAT SHE
HAD LOST MONEY AND WAS CONSTRAINED TO MORTGAGE HER LAND
OTHERS
CONJECTURED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED AND THAT THE SETTLEMENTS
WERE PREPARING
MR
MOORE AND HENRY SYMPSON WERE TOGETHER IN THE SCHOOLROOM
THE TUTOR
WAS WAITING FOR A LESSON WHICH THE PUPIL SEEMED BUSY IN PREPARING
HENRY MAKE HASTE
THE AFTERNOON IS GETTING ON
IS IT SIR
CERTAINLY
ARE YOU NEARLY READY WITH THAT LESSON
NO
NOT NEARLY READY
I HAVE NOT CONSTRUED A LINE
MR
MOORE LOOKED UP
THE BOY'S TONE WAS RATHER PECULIAR
THE TASK PRESENTS NO DIFFICULTIES HENRY OR IF IT DOES BRING THEM TO
ME
WE WILL WORK TOGETHER
MR
MOORE I CAN DO NO WORK
MY BOY YOU ARE ILL
SIR I AM NOT WORSE IN BODILY HEALTH THAN USUAL BUT MY HEART IS FULL
SHUT THE BOOK
COME HITHER HARRY
COME TO THE FIRESIDE
HARRY LIMPED FORWARD
HIS TUTOR PLACED HIM IN A CHAIR HIS LIPS WERE
QUIVERING HIS EYES BRIMMING
HE LAID HIS CRUTCH ON THE FLOOR BENT DOWN
HIS HEAD AND WEPT
THIS DISTRESS IS NOT OCCASIONED BY PHYSICAL PAIN YOU SAY HARRY YOU
HAVE A GRIEF TELL IT ME
SIR I HAVE SUCH A GRIEF AS I NEVER HAD BEFORE
I WISH IT COULD BE
RELIEVED IN SOME WAY I CAN HARDLY BEAR IT
WHO KNOWS BUT IF WE TALK IT OVER WE MAY RELIEVE IT WHAT IS THE
CAUSE WHOM DOES IT CONCERN
THE CAUSE SIR IS SHIRLEY IT CONCERNS SHIRLEY
DOES IT YOU THINK HER CHANGED
ALL WHO KNOW HER THINK HER CHANGED YOU TOO MR
MOORE
NOT SERIOUSLY NO
I SEE NO ALTERATION BUT SUCH AS A FAVOURABLE TURN
MIGHT REPAIR IN A FEW WEEKS BESIDES HER OWN WORD MUST GO FOR
SOMETHING SHE SAYS SHE IS WELL
THERE IT IS SIR
AS LONG AS SHE MAINTAINED SHE WAS WELL I BELIEVED
HER
WHEN I WAS SAD OUT OF HER SIGHT I SOON RECOVERED SPIRITS IN HER
PRESENCE
NOW
WELL HARRY NOW
HAS SHE SAID ANYTHING TO YOU YOU AND SHE WERE
TOGETHER IN THE GARDEN TWO HOURS THIS MORNING
I SAW HER TALKING AND
YOU LISTENING
NOW MY DEAR HARRY IF MISS KEELDAR HAS SAID SHE IS ILL
AND ENJOINED YOU TO KEEP HER SECRET DO NOT OBEY HER
FOR HER LIFE'S
SAKE AVOW EVERYTHING
SPEAK MY BOY
SHE SAY SHE IS ILL I BELIEVE SIR IF SHE WERE DYING SHE WOULD
SMILE AND AVER 'NOTHING AILS ME
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED THEN WHAT NEW CIRCUMSTANCE
I HAVE LEARNED THAT SHE HAS JUST MADE HER WILL
MADE HER WILL
THE TUTOR AND PUPIL WERE SILENT
SHE TOLD YOU THAT ASKED MOORE WHEN SOME MINUTES HAD ELAPSED
SHE TOLD ME QUITE CHEERFULLY NOT AS AN OMINOUS CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH I
FELT IT TO BE
SHE SAID I WAS THE ONLY PERSON BESIDES HER SOLICITOR
PEARSON HALL AND MR
HELSTONE AND MR
YORKE WHO KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT
IT AND TO ME SHE INTIMATED SHE WISHED SPECIALLY TO EXPLAIN ITS
PROVISIONS
GO ON HARRY
'BECAUSE SHE SAID LOOKING DOWN ON ME WITH HER BEAUTIFUL EYES OH
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL MR
MOORE I LOVE THEM I LOVE HER SHE IS MY
STAR HEAVEN MUST NOT CLAIM HER SHE IS LOVELY IN THIS WORLD AND FITTED
FOR THIS WORLD
SHIRLEY IS NOT AN ANGEL SHE IS A WOMAN AND SHE SHALL
LIVE WITH MEN
SERAPHS SHALL NOT HAVE HER MR
MOORE IF ONE OF THE
'SONS OF GOD WITH WINGS WIDE AND BRIGHT AS THE SKY BLUE AND SOUNDING
AS THE SEA HAVING SEEN THAT SHE WAS FAIR DESCENDED TO CLAIM HER HIS
CLAIM SHOULD BE WITHSTOOD WITHSTOOD BY ME BOY AND CRIPPLE AS I AM
HENRY SYMPSON GO ON WHEN I TELL YOU
'BECAUSE SHE SAID 'IF I MADE NO WILL AND DIED BEFORE YOU HARRY
ALL MY PROPERTY WOULD GO TO YOU AND I DO NOT INTEND THAT IT SHOULD BE
SO THOUGH YOUR FATHER WOULD LIKE IT
BUT YOU SHE SAID 'WILL HAVE HIS
WHOLE ESTATE WHICH IS LARGE LARGER THAN FIELDHEAD
YOUR SISTERS WILL
HAVE NOTHING SO I HAVE LEFT THEM SOME MONEY THOUGH I DO NOT LOVE THEM
BOTH TOGETHER HALF SO MUCH AS I LOVE ONE LOCK OF YOUR FAIR HAIR SHE
SAID THESE WORDS AND SHE CALLED ME HER 'DARLING AND LET ME KISS HER
SHE WENT ON TO TELL ME THAT SHE HAD LEFT CAROLINE HELSTONE SOME MONEY
TOO THAT THIS MANOR HOUSE WITH ITS FURNITURE AND BOOKS SHE HAD
BEQUEATHED TO ME AS SHE DID NOT CHOOSE TO TAKE THE OLD FAMILY PLACE
FROM HER OWN BLOOD AND THAT ALL THE REST OF HER PROPERTY AMOUNTING TO
ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS EXCLUSIVE OF THE LEGACIES TO MY SISTERS
AND MISS HELSTONE SHE HAD WILLED NOT TO ME SEEING I WAS ALREADY RICH
BUT TO A GOOD MAN WHO WOULD MAKE THE BEST USE OF IT THAT ANY HUMAN
BEING COULD DO A MAN SHE SAID THAT WAS BOTH GENTLE AND BRAVE STRONG
AND MERCIFUL A MAN THAT MIGHT NOT PROFESS TO BE PIOUS BUT SHE KNEW HE
HAD THE SECRET OF RELIGION PURE AND UNDEFILED BEFORE GOD
THE SPIRIT OF
LOVE AND PEACE WAS WITH HIM
HE VISITED THE FATHERLESS AND WIDOWS IN
THEIR AFFLICTION AND KEPT HIMSELF UNSPOTTED FROM THE WORLD
THEN SHE
ASKED 'DO YOU APPROVE WHAT I HAVE DONE HARRY I COULD NOT ANSWER
MY
TEARS CHOKED ME AS THEY DO NOW
MR
MOORE ALLOWED HIS PUPIL A MOMENT TO CONTEND WITH AND MASTER HIS
EMOTION
HE THEN DEMANDED WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY
WHEN I HAD SIGNIFIED MY FULL CONSENT TO THE CONDITIONS OF HER WILL SHE
TOLD ME I WAS A GENEROUS BOY AND SHE WAS PROUD OF ME
'AND NOW SHE
ADDED 'IN CASE ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN YOU WILL KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO
MALICE WHEN SHE COMES WHISPERING HARD THINGS IN YOUR EAR INSINUATING
THAT SHIRLEY HAS WRONGED YOU THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE YOU
YOU WILL KNOW
THAT I DID LOVE YOU HARRY THAT NO SISTER COULD HAVE LOVED YOU
BETTER MY OWN TREASURE MR
MOORE SIR WHEN I REMEMBER HER VOICE AND
RECALL HER LOOK MY HEART BEATS AS IF IT WOULD BREAK ITS STRINGS
SHE
MAY GO TO HEAVEN BEFORE ME IF GOD COMMANDS IT SHE MUST BUT THE
REST OF MY LIFE AND MY LIFE WILL NOT BE LONG I AM GLAD OF THAT
NOW SHALL BE A STRAIGHT QUICK THOUGHTFUL JOURNEY IN THE PATH HER STEP
HAS PRESSED
I THOUGHT TO ENTER THE VAULT OF THE KEELDARS BEFORE HER
SHOULD IT BE OTHERWISE LAY MY COFFIN BY SHIRLEY'S SIDE
MOORE ANSWERED HIM WITH A WEIGHTY CALM THAT OFFERED A STRANGE CONTRAST
TO THE BOY'S PERTURBED ENTHUSIASM
YOU ARE WRONG BOTH OF YOU YOU HARM EACH OTHER
IF YOUTH ONCE FALLS
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A SHADOWY TERROR IT IMAGINES THERE WILL NEVER BE
FULL SUNLIGHT AGAIN ITS FIRST CALAMITY IT FANCIES WILL LAST A LIFETIME
WHAT MORE DID SHE SAY ANYTHING MORE
WE SETTLED ONE OR TWO FAMILY POINTS BETWEEN OURSELVES
I SHOULD RATHER LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
BUT MR
MOORE YOU SMILE
I COULD NOT SMILE TO SEE SHIRLEY IN SUCH A
MOOD
MY BOY I AM NEITHER NERVOUS NOR POETIC NOR INEXPERIENCED
I SEE
THINGS AS THEY ARE YOU DON'T AS YET
TELL ME THESE FAMILY POINTS
ONLY SIR SHE ASKED ME WHETHER I CONSIDERED MYSELF MOST OF A KEELDAR
OR A SYMPSON AND I ANSWERED I WAS KEELDAR TO THE CORE OF THE HEART AND
TO THE MARROW OF THE BONES
SHE SAID SHE WAS GLAD OF IT FOR BESIDES
HER I WAS THE ONLY KEELDAR LEFT IN ENGLAND
AND THEN WE AGREED ON SOME
MATTERS
WELL
WELL SIR THAT IF I LIVED TO INHERIT MY FATHER'S ESTATE AND HER
HOUSE I WAS TO TAKE THE NAME OF KEELDAR AND TO MAKE FIELDHEAD MY
RESIDENCE
HENRY SHIRLEY KEELDAR I SAID I WOULD BE CALLED AND I WILL
HER NAME AND HER MANOR HOUSE ARE AGES OLD AND SYMPSON AND SYMPSON GROVE
ARE OF YESTERDAY
COME YOU ARE NEITHER OF YOU GOING TO HEAVEN YET
I HAVE THE BEST HOPES
OF YOU BOTH WITH YOUR PROUD DISTINCTIONS A PAIR OF HALF FLEDGED
EAGLETS
NOW WHAT IS YOUR INFERENCE FROM ALL YOU HAVE TOLD ME PUT IT
INTO WORDS
THAT SHIRLEY THINKS SHE IS GOING TO DIE
SHE REFERRED TO HER HEALTH
NOT ONCE BUT I ASSURE YOU SHE IS WASTING
HER HANDS ARE GROWN QUITE
THIN AND SO IS HER CHEEK
DOES SHE EVER COMPLAIN TO YOUR MOTHER OR SISTERS
NEVER
SHE LAUGHS AT THEM WHEN THEY QUESTION HER
MR
MOORE SHE IS A
STRANGE BEING SO FAIR AND GIRLISH NOT A MAN LIKE WOMAN AT ALL NOT AN
AMAZON AND YET LIFTING HER HEAD ABOVE BOTH HELP AND SYMPATHY
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS NOW HENRY IS SHE IN THE HOUSE OR RIDING
OUT
SURELY NOT OUT SIR
IT RAINS FAST
TRUE WHICH HOWEVER IS NO GUARANTEE THAT SHE IS NOT AT THIS MOMENT
CANTERING OVER RUSHEDGE
OF LATE SHE HAS NEVER PERMITTED WEATHER TO BE A
HINDRANCE TO HER RIDES
YOU REMEMBER MR
MOORE HOW WET AND STORMY IT WAS LAST WEDNESDAY SO
WILD INDEED THAT SHE WOULD NOT PERMIT ZO TO BE SADDLED YET THE BLAST
SHE THOUGHT TOO TEMPESTUOUS FOR HER MARE SHE HERSELF FACED ON FOOT THAT
AFTERNOON SHE WALKED NEARLY AS FAR AS NUNNELY
I ASKED HER WHEN SHE
CAME IN IF SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF TAKING COLD
'NOT I SHE SAID
'IT
WOULD BE TOO MUCH GOOD LUCK FOR ME
I DON'T KNOW HARRY BUT THE BEST
THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO ME WOULD BE TO TAKE A GOOD COLD AND FEVER
AND SO PASS OFF LIKE OTHER CHRISTIANS SHE IS RECKLESS YOU SEE SIR
RECKLESS INDEED GO AND FIND OUT WHERE SHE IS AND IF YOU CAN GET AN
OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO HER WITHOUT ATTRACTING ATTENTION REQUEST HER
TO COME HERE A MINUTE
YES SIR
HE SNATCHED HIS CRUTCH AND STARTED UP TO GO
HARRY
HE RETURNED
DO NOT DELIVER THE MESSAGE FORMALLY
WORD IT AS IN FORMER DAYS YOU
WOULD HAVE WORDED AN ORDINARY SUMMONS TO THE SCHOOLROOM
I SEE SIR
SHE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO OBEY
AND HARRY
SIR
I WILL CALL YOU WHEN I WANT YOU
TILL THEN YOU ARE DISPENSED FROM
LESSONS
HE DEPARTED
MR
MOORE LEFT ALONE ROSE FROM HIS DESK
I CAN BE VERY COOL AND VERY SUPERCILIOUS WITH HENRY HE SAID
I CAN
SEEM TO MAKE LIGHT OF HIS APPREHENSIONS AND LOOK DOWN DU HAUT DE MA
GRANDEUR ON HIS YOUTHFUL ARDOUR
TO HIM I CAN SPEAK AS IF IN MY
EYES THEY WERE BOTH CHILDREN
LET ME SEE IF I CAN KEEP UP THE SAME RLE
WITH HER
I HAVE KNOWN THE MOMENT WHEN I SEEMED ABOUT TO FORGET IT WHEN
CONFUSION AND SUBMISSION SEEMED ABOUT TO CRUSH ME WITH THEIR SOFT
TYRANNY WHEN MY TONGUE FALTERED AND I HAVE ALMOST LET THE MANTLE DROP
AND STOOD IN HER PRESENCE NOT MASTER NO BUT SOMETHING ELSE
I TRUST I
SHALL NEVER SO PLAY THE FOOL
IT IS WELL FOR A SIR PHILIP NUNNELY TO
REDDEN WHEN HE MEETS HER EYE
HE MAY PERMIT HIMSELF THE INDULGENCE OF
SUBMISSION
HE MAY EVEN WITHOUT DISGRACE SUFFER HIS HAND TO TREMBLE
WHEN IT TOUCHES HERS BUT IF ONE OF HER FARMERS WERE TO SHOW HIMSELF
SUSCEPTIBLE AND SENTIMENTAL HE WOULD MERELY PROVE HIS NEED OF A STRAIT
WAISTCOAT
SO FAR I HAVE ALWAYS DONE VERY WELL
SHE HAS SAT NEAR ME AND
I HAVE NOT SHAKEN MORE THAN MY DESK
I HAVE ENCOUNTERED HER LOOKS AND
SMILES LIKE WHY LIKE A TUTOR AS I AM
HER HAND I NEVER YET
TOUCHED NEVER UNDERWENT THAT TEST
HER FARMER OR HER FOOTMAN I AM
NOT NO SERF NOR SERVANT OF HERS HAVE I EVER BEEN BUT I AM POOR AND IT
BEHOVES ME TO LOOK TO MY SELF RESPECT NOT TO COMPROMISE AN INCH OF IT
WHAT DID SHE MEAN BY THAT ALLUSION TO THE COLD PEOPLE WHO PETRIFY FLESH
TO MARBLE IT PLEASED ME I HARDLY KNOW WHY I WOULD NOT PERMIT MYSELF
TO INQUIRE
I NEVER DO INDULGE IN SCRUTINY EITHER OF HER LANGUAGE OR
COUNTENANCE FOR IF I DID I SHOULD SOMETIMES FORGET COMMON SENSE AND
BELIEVE IN ROMANCE
A STRANGE SECRET ECSTASY STEALS THROUGH MY VEINS AT
MOMENTS
I'LL NOT ENCOURAGE I'LL NOT REMEMBER IT
I AM RESOLVED AS
LONG AS MAY BE TO RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SAY WITH PAUL 'I AM NOT MAD BUT
SPEAK FORTH THE WORDS OF TRUTH AND SOBERNESS
HE PAUSED LISTENING
WILL SHE COME OR WILL SHE NOT COME HE INQUIRED
HOW WILL SHE TAKE
THE MESSAGE NAVELY OR DISDAINFULLY LIKE A CHILD OR LIKE A QUEEN BOTH
CHARACTERS ARE IN HER NATURE
IF SHE COMES WHAT SHALL I SAY TO HER HOW ACCOUNT FIRSTLY FOR THE
FREEDOM OF THE REQUEST SHALL I APOLOGIZE TO HER I COULD IN ALL
HUMILITY BUT WOULD AN APOLOGY TEND TO PLACE US IN THE POSITIONS WE
OUGHT RELATIVELY TO OCCUPY IN THIS MATTER I MUST KEEP UP THE
PROFESSOR OTHERWISE I HEAR A DOOR
HE WAITED
MANY MINUTES PASSED
SHE WILL REFUSE ME
HENRY IS ENTREATING HER TO COME SHE DECLINES
MY
PETITION IS PRESUMPTION IN HER EYES
LET HER ONLY COME I CAN TEACH
HER TO THE CONTRARY
I WOULD RATHER SHE WERE A LITTLE PERVERSE IT WILL
STEEL ME
I PREFER HER CUIRASSED IN PRIDE ARMED WITH A TAUNT
HER SCORN
STARTLES ME FROM MY DREAMS I STAND UP MYSELF
A SARCASM FROM HER EYES
OR LIPS PUTS STRENGTH INTO EVERY NERVE AND SINEW I HAVE
SOME STEP
APPROACHES AND NOT HENRY'S
THE DOOR UNCLOSED MISS KEELDAR CAME IN
THE MESSAGE IT APPEARED HAD
FOUND HER AT HER NEEDLE SHE BROUGHT HER WORK IN HER HAND
THAT DAY SHE
HAD NOT BEEN RIDING OUT SHE HAD EVIDENTLY PASSED IT QUIETLY
SHE WORE
HER NEAT INDOOR DRESS AND SILK APRON
THIS WAS NO THALESTRIS FROM THE
FIELDS BUT A QUIET DOMESTIC CHARACTER FROM THE FIRESIDE
MR
MOORE HAD
HER AT ADVANTAGE
HE SHOULD HAVE ADDRESSED HER AT ONCE IN SOLEMN
ACCENTS AND WITH RIGID MIEN
PERHAPS HE WOULD HAD SHE LOOKED SAUCY
BUT HER AIR NEVER SHOWED LESS OF CRNERIE
A SOFT KIND OF YOUTHFUL
SHYNESS DEPRESSED HER EYELID AND MANTLED ON HER CHEEK
THE TUTOR STOOD
SILENT
SHE MADE A FULL STOP BETWEEN THE DOOR AND HIS DESK
DID YOU WANT ME SIR SHE ASKED
I VENTURED MISS KEELDAR TO SEND FOR YOU THAT IS TO ASK AN INTERVIEW
OF A FEW MINUTES
SHE WAITED SHE PLIED HER NEEDLE
WELL SIR NOT LIFTING HER EYES WHAT ABOUT
BE SEATED FIRST
THE SUBJECT I WOULD BROACH IS ONE OF SOME MOMENT
PERHAPS I HAVE HARDLY A RIGHT TO APPROACH IT
IT IS POSSIBLE I OUGHT TO
FRAME AN APOLOGY IT IS POSSIBLE NO APOLOGY CAN EXCUSE ME
THE LIBERTY I
HAVE TAKEN ARISES FROM A CONVERSATION WITH HENRY
THE BOY IS UNHAPPY
ABOUT YOUR HEALTH ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE UNHAPPY ON THAT SUBJECT
IT IS
OF YOUR HEALTH I WOULD SPEAK
I AM QUITE WELL SHE SAID BRIEFLY
YET CHANGED
THAT MATTERS TO NONE BUT MYSELF
WE ALL CHANGE
WILL YOU SIT DOWN FORMERLY MISS KEELDAR I HAD SOME INFLUENCE WITH
YOU HAVE I ANY NOW MAY I FEEL THAT WHAT I AM SAYING IS NOT ACCOUNTED
POSITIVE PRESUMPTION
LET ME READ SOME FRENCH MR
MOORE OR I WILL EVEN TAKE A SPELL AT THE
LATIN GRAMMAR AND LET US PROCLAIM A TRUCE TO ALL SANITARY DISCUSSIONS
NO NO
IT IS TIME THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS
DISCUSS AWAY THEN BUT DO NOT CHOOSE ME FOR YOUR TEXT
I AM A HEALTHY
SUBJECT
DO YOU NOT THINK IT WRONG TO AFFIRM AND REAFFIRM WHAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY
UNTRUE
I SAY I AM WELL
I HAVE NEITHER COUGH PAIN NOR FEVER
IS THERE NO EQUIVOCATION IN THAT ASSERTION IS IT THE DIRECT TRUTH
THE DIRECT TRUTH
LOUIS MOORE LOOKED AT HER EARNESTLY
I CAN MYSELF HE SAID TRACE NO INDICATIONS OF ACTUAL DISEASE
BUT
WHY THEN ARE YOU ALTERED
AM I ALTERED
WE WILL TRY
WE WILL SEEK A PROOF
HOW
I ASK IN THE FIRST PLACE DO YOU SLEEP AS YOU USED TO
I DO NOT BUT IT IS NOT BECAUSE I AM ILL
HAVE YOU THE APPETITE YOU ONCE HAD
NO BUT IT IS NOT BECAUSE I AM ILL
YOU REMEMBER THIS LITTLE RING FASTENED TO MY WATCH CHAIN IT WAS MY
MOTHER'S AND IS TOO SMALL TO PASS THE JOINT OF MY LITTLE FINGER
YOU
HAVE MANY A TIME SPORTIVELY PURLOINED IT
IT FITTED YOUR FORE FINGER
TRY NOW
SHE PERMITTED THE TEST
THE RING DROPPED FROM THE WASTED LITTLE HAND
LOUIS PICKED IT UP AND REATTACHED IT TO THE CHAIN
AN UNEASY FLUSH
COLOURED HIS BROW
SHIRLEY AGAIN SAID IT IS NOT BECAUSE I AM ILL
NOT ONLY HAVE YOU LOST SLEEP APPETITE AND FLESH PROCEEDED MOORE
BUT YOUR SPIRITS ARE ALWAYS AT EBB
BESIDES THERE IS A NERVOUS ALARM
IN YOUR EYE A NERVOUS DISQUIET IN YOUR MANNER
THESE PECULIARITIES WERE
NOT FORMERLY YOURS
MR
MOORE WE WILL PAUSE HERE
YOU HAVE EXACTLY HIT IT
I AM NERVOUS
NOW TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
WHAT WET WEATHER WE HAVE STEADY POURING
RAIN
YOU NERVOUS YES AND IF MISS KEELDAR IS NERVOUS IT IS NOT WITHOUT A
CAUSE
LET ME REACH IT
LET ME LOOK NEARER
THE AILMENT IS NOT PHYSICAL
I HAVE SUSPECTED THAT
IT CAME IN ONE MOMENT
I KNOW THE DAY
I NOTICED
THE CHANGE
YOUR PAIN IS MENTAL
NOT AT ALL
IT IS NOTHING SO DIGNIFIED MERELY NERVOUS
OH DISMISS THE
TOPIC
WHEN IT IS EXHAUSTED NOT TILL THEN
NERVOUS ALARMS SHOULD ALWAYS BE
COMMUNICATED THAT THEY MAY BE DISSIPATED
I WISH I HAD THE GIFT OF
PERSUASION AND COULD INCLINE YOU TO SPEAK WILLINGLY
I BELIEVE
CONFESSION IN YOUR CASE WOULD BE HALF EQUIVALENT TO CURE
NO SAID SHIRLEY ABRUPTLY
I WISH THAT WERE AT ALL PROBABLE BUT I AM
AFRAID IT IS NOT
SHE SUSPENDED HER WORK A MOMENT
SHE WAS NOW SEATED
RESTING HER ELBOW
ON THE TABLE SHE LEANED HER HEAD ON HER HAND
MR
MOORE LOOKED AS IF HE
FELT HE HAD AT LAST GAINED SOME FOOTING IN THIS DIFFICULT PATH
SHE WAS
SERIOUS AND IN HER WISH WAS IMPLIED AN IMPORTANT ADMISSION AFTER THAT
SHE COULD NO LONGER AFFIRM THAT NOTHING AILED HER
THE TUTOR ALLOWED HER SOME MINUTES FOR REPOSE AND REFLECTION ERE HE
RETURNED TO THE CHARGE
ONCE HIS LIPS MOVED TO SPEAK BUT HE THOUGHT
BETTER OF IT AND PROLONGED THE PAUSE
SHIRLEY LIFTED HER EYE TO HIS
HAD HE BETRAYED INJUDICIOUS EMOTION PERHAPS OBSTINATE PERSISTENCE IN
SILENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT BUT HE LOOKED CALM STRONG
TRUSTWORTHY
I HAD BETTER TELL YOU THAN MY AUNT SHE SAID OR THAN MY COUSINS
OR MY UNCLE
THEY WOULD ALL MAKE SUCH A BUSTLE AND IT IS THAT VERY
BUSTLE I DREAD THE ALARM THE FLURRY THE CLAT
IN SHORT I NEVER
LIKED TO BE THE CENTRE OF A SMALL DOMESTIC WHIRLPOOL
YOU CAN BEAR A
LITTLE SHOCK EH
A GREAT ONE IF NECESSARY
NOT A MUSCLE OF THE MAN'S FRAME MOVED AND YET HIS LARGE HEART BEAT FAST
IN HIS DEEP CHEST
WHAT WAS SHE GOING TO TELL HIM WAS IRREMEDIABLE
MISCHIEF DONE
HAD I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO GO TO YOU I WOULD NEVER HAVE MADE A SECRET
OF THE MATTER ONE MOMENT SHE CONTINUED
I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU AT
ONCE AND ASKED ADVICE
WHY WAS IT NOT RIGHT TO COME TO ME
IT MIGHT BE RIGHT I DO NOT MEAN THAT BUT I COULD NOT DO IT
I
SEEMED TO HAVE NO TITLE TO TROUBLE YOU
THE MISHAP CONCERNED ME ONLY
I
WANTED TO KEEP IT TO MYSELF AND PEOPLE WILL NOT LET ME
I TELL YOU I
HATE TO BE AN OBJECT OF WORRYING ATTENTION OR A THEME FOR VILLAGE
GOSSIP
BESIDES IT MAY PASS AWAY WITHOUT RESULT GOD KNOWS
MOORE THOUGH TORTURED WITH SUSPENSE DID NOT DEMAND A QUICK
EXPLANATION
HE SUFFERED NEITHER GESTURE GLANCE NOR WORD TO BETRAY
IMPATIENCE
HIS TRANQUILLITY TRANQUILLIZED SHIRLEY HIS CONFIDENCE
REASSURED HER
GREAT EFFECTS MAY SPRING FROM TRIVIAL CAUSES SHE REMARKED AS SHE
LOOSENED A BRACELET FROM HER WRIST
THEN UNFASTENING HER SLEEVE AND
PARTIALLY TURNING IT UP LOOK HERE MR
MOORE
SHE SHOWED A MARK IN HER WHITE ARM RATHER A DEEP THOUGH HEALED UP
INDENTATION SOMETHING BETWEEN A BURN AND A CUT
I WOULD NOT SHOW THAT TO ANY ONE IN BRIARFIELD BUT YOU BECAUSE YOU CAN
TAKE IT QUIETLY
CERTAINLY THERE IS NOTHING IN THE LITTLE MARK TO SHOCK
ITS HISTORY
WILL EXPLAIN
SMALL AS IT IS IT HAS TAKEN MY SLEEP AWAY AND MADE ME NERVOUS THIN
AND FOOLISH BECAUSE ON ACCOUNT OF THAT LITTLE MARK I AM OBLIGED TO
LOOK FORWARD TO A POSSIBILITY THAT HAS ITS TERRORS
THE SLEEVE WAS READJUSTED THE BRACELET REPLACED
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU TRY ME HE SAID SMILING
I AM A PATIENT SORT OF
MAN BUT MY PULSE IS QUICKENING
WHATEVER HAPPENS YOU WILL BEFRIEND ME MR
MOORE YOU WILL GIVE ME THE
BENEFIT OF YOUR SELF POSSESSION AND NOT LEAVE ME AT THE MERCY OF
AGITATED COWARDS
I MAKE NO PROMISE NOW
TELL ME THE TALE AND THEN EXACT WHAT PLEDGE YOU
WILL
IT IS A VERY SHORT TALE
I TOOK A WALK WITH ISABELLA AND GERTRUDE ONE
DAY ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO
THEY REACHED HOME BEFORE ME I STAYED BEHIND
TO SPEAK TO JOHN
AFTER LEAVING HIM I PLEASED MYSELF WITH LINGERING IN
THE LANE WHERE ALL WAS VERY STILL AND SHADY
I WAS TIRED OF CHATTERING
TO THE GIRLS AND IN NO HURRY TO REJOIN THEM
AS I STOOD LEANING AGAINST
THE GATE PILLAR THINKING SOME VERY HAPPY THOUGHTS ABOUT MY FUTURE
LIFE FOR THAT MORNING I IMAGINED THAT EVENTS WERE BEGINNING TO TURN AS
I HAD LONG WISHED THEM TO TURN
AH NUNNELY HAD BEEN WITH HER THE EVENING BEFORE THOUGHT MOORE
PARENTHETICALLY
I HEARD A PANTING SOUND A DOG CAME RUNNING UP THE LANE
I KNOW MOST OF
THE DOGS IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
IT WAS PHBE ONE OF MR
SAM WYNNE'S
POINTERS
THE POOR CREATURE RAN WITH HER HEAD DOWN HER TONGUE HANGING
OUT SHE LOOKED AS IF BRUISED AND BEATEN ALL OVER
I CALLED HER
I MEANT
TO COAX HER INTO THE HOUSE AND GIVE HER SOME WATER AND DINNER
I FELT
SURE SHE HAD BEEN ILL USED
MR
SAM OFTEN FLOGS HIS POINTERS CRUELLY
SHE WAS TOO FLURRIED TO KNOW ME AND WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO PAT HER HEAD
SHE TURNED AND SNATCHED AT MY ARM
SHE BIT IT SO AS TO DRAW BLOOD THEN
RAN PANTING ON
DIRECTLY AFTER MR
WYNNE'S KEEPER CAME UP CARRYING A
GUN
HE ASKED IF I HAD SEEN A DOG
I TOLD HIM I HAD SEEN PHBE
'YOU HAD BETTER CHAIN UP TARTAR MA'AM HE SAID 'AND TELL YOUR PEOPLE
TO KEEP WITHIN THE HOUSE
I AM AFTER PHBE TO SHOOT HER AND THE GROOM
IS GONE ANOTHER WAY
SHE IS RAGING MAD
MR
MOORE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND FOLDED HIS ARMS ACROSS HIS CHEST
MISS KEELDAR RESUMED HER SQUARE OF SILK CANVAS AND CONTINUED THE
CREATION OF A WREATH OF PARMESE VIOLETS
AND YOU TOLD NO ONE SOUGHT NO HELP NO CURE YOU WOULD NOT COME TO
ME
I GOT AS FAR AS THE SCHOOLROOM DOOR THERE MY COURAGE FAILED
I
PREFERRED TO CUSHION THE MATTER
WHY WHAT CAN I DEMAND BETTER IN THIS WORLD THAN TO BE OF USE TO YOU
I HAD NO CLAIM
MONSTROUS AND YOU DID NOTHING
YES
I WALKED STRAIGHT INTO THE LAUNDRY WHERE THEY ARE IRONING MOST OF
THE WEEK NOW THAT I HAVE SO MANY GUESTS IN THE HOUSE
WHILE THE MAID
WAS BUSY CRIMPING OR STARCHING I TOOK AN ITALIAN IRON FROM THE FIRE
AND APPLIED THE LIGHT SCARLET GLOWING TIP TO MY ARM
I BORED IT WELL
IN
IT CAUTERIZED THE LITTLE WOUND
THEN I WENT UPSTAIRS
I DARE SAY YOU NEVER ONCE GROANED
I AM SURE I DON'T KNOW
I WAS VERY MISERABLE NOT FIRM OR TRANQUIL AT
ALL I THINK
THERE WAS NO CALM IN MY MIND
THERE WAS CALM IN YOUR PERSON
I REMEMBER LISTENING THE WHOLE TIME WE
SAT AT LUNCHEON TO HEAR IF YOU MOVED IN THE ROOM ABOVE
ALL WAS QUIET
I WAS SITTING AT THE FOOT OF THE BED WISHING PHBE HAD NOT BITTEN
ME
AND ALONE
YOU LIKE SOLITUDE
PARDON ME
YOU DISDAIN SYMPATHY
DO I MR
MOORE
WITH YOUR POWERFUL MIND YOU MUST FEEL INDEPENDENT OF HELP OF ADVICE
OF SOCIETY
SO BE IT SINCE IT PLEASES YOU
SHE SMILED
SHE PURSUED HER EMBROIDERY CAREFULLY AND QUICKLY BUT HER
EYELASH TWINKLED AND THEN IT GLITTERED AND THEN A DROP FELL
MR
MOORE LEANED FORWARD ON HIS DESK MOVED HIS CHAIR ALTERED HIS
ATTITUDE
IF IT IS NOT SO HE ASKED WITH A PECULIAR MELLOW CHANGE IN HIS
VOICE HOW IS IT THEN
I DON'T KNOW
YOU DO KNOW BUT YOU WON'T SPEAK
ALL MUST BE LOCKED UP IN YOURSELF
BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORTH SHARING
BECAUSE NOBODY CAN GIVE THE HIGH PRICE YOU REQUIRE FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE
NOBODY IS RICH ENOUGH TO PURCHASE IT
NOBODY HAS THE HONOUR THE
INTELLECT THE POWER YOU DEMAND IN YOUR ADVISER
THERE IS NOT A SHOULDER
IN ENGLAND ON WHICH YOU WOULD REST YOUR HAND FOR SUPPORT FAR LESS A
BOSOM WHICH YOU WOULD PERMIT TO PILLOW YOUR HEAD
OF COURSE YOU MUST
LIVE ALONE
I CAN LIVE ALONE IF NEED BE
BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT HOW TO LIVE
BUT HOW TO DIE ALONE
THAT STRIKES ME IN A MORE GRISLY LIGHT
YOU APPREHEND THE EFFECTS OF THE VIRUS YOU ANTICIPATE AN INDEFINITELY
THREATENING DREADFUL DOOM
SHE BOWED
YOU ARE VERY NERVOUS AND WOMANISH
YOU COMPLIMENTED ME TWO MINUTES SINCE ON MY POWERFUL MIND
YOU ARE VERY WOMANISH
IF THE WHOLE AFFAIR WERE COOLLY EXAMINED AND
DISCUSSED I FEEL ASSURED IT WOULD TURN OUT THAT THERE IS NO DANGER OF
YOUR DYING AT ALL
AMEN I AM VERY WILLING TO LIVE IF IT PLEASE GOD
I HAVE FELT LIFE
SWEET
HOW CAN IT BE OTHERWISE THAN SWEET WITH YOUR ENDOWMENTS AND NATURE DO
YOU TRULY EXPECT THAT YOU WILL BE SEIZED WITH HYDROPHOBIA AND DIE
RAVING MAD
I EXPECT IT AND HAVE FEARED IT
JUST NOW I FEAR NOTHING
NOR DO I ON YOUR ACCOUNT
I DOUBT WHETHER THE SMALLEST PARTICLE OF
VIRUS MINGLED WITH YOUR BLOOD AND IF IT DID LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT
YOUNG HEALTHY FAULTLESSLY SOUND AS YOU ARE NO HARM WILL ENSUE
FOR
THE REST I SHALL INQUIRE WHETHER THE DOG WAS REALLY MAD
I HOLD SHE WAS
NOT MAD
TELL NOBODY THAT SHE BIT ME
WHY SHOULD I WHEN I BELIEVE THE BITE INNOCUOUS AS A CUT OF THIS
PENKNIFE MAKE YOURSELF EASY
I AM EASY THOUGH I VALUE YOUR LIFE AS
MUCH AS I DO MY OWN CHANCE OF HAPPINESS IN ETERNITY
LOOK UP
WHY MR
MOORE
I WISH TO SEE IF YOU ARE CHEERED
PUT YOUR WORK DOWN RAISE YOUR HEAD
THERE
LOOK AT ME
THANK YOU
AND IS THE CLOUD BROKEN
I FEAR NOTHING
IS YOUR MIND RESTORED TO ITS OWN NATURAL SUNNY CLIME
I AM VERY CONTENT BUT I WANT YOUR PROMISE
DICTATE
YOU KNOW IN CASE THE WORST I HAVE FEARED SHOULD HAPPEN THEY WILL
SMOTHER ME
YOU NEED NOT SMILE
THEY WILL THEY ALWAYS DO
MY UNCLE WILL
BE FULL OF HORROR WEAKNESS PRECIPITATION AND THAT IS THE ONLY
EXPEDIENT WHICH WILL SUGGEST ITSELF TO HIM
NOBODY IN THE HOUSE WILL BE
SELF POSSESSED BUT YOU
NOW PROMISE TO BEFRIEND ME TO KEEP MR
SYMPSON
AWAY FROM ME NOT TO LET HENRY COME NEAR LEST I SHOULD HURT HIM
MIND MIND THAT YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF TOO
BUT I SHALL NOT INJURE
YOU I KNOW I SHALL NOT
LOCK THE CHAMBER DOOR AGAINST THE SURGEONS
TURN THEM OUT IF THEY GET IN
LET NEITHER THE YOUNG NOR THE OLD MACTURK
LAY A FINGER ON ME NOR MR
GREAVES THEIR COLLEAGUE AND LASTLY IF I
GIVE TROUBLE WITH YOUR OWN HAND ADMINISTER TO ME A STRONG
NARCOTIC SUCH A SURE DOSE OF LAUDANUM AS SHALL LEAVE NO MISTAKE
PROMISE TO DO THIS
MOORE LEFT HIS DESK AND PERMITTED HIMSELF THE RECREATION OF ONE OR TWO
TURNS THROUGH THE ROOM
STOPPING BEHIND SHIRLEY'S CHAIR HE BENT OVER
HER AND SAID IN A LOW EMPHATIC VOICE I PROMISE ALL YOU ASK WITHOUT
COMMENT WITHOUT RESERVATION
IF FEMALE HELP IS NEEDED CALL IN MY HOUSEKEEPER MRS
GILL
LET HER
LAY ME OUT IF I DIE
SHE IS ATTACHED TO ME
SHE WRONGED ME AGAIN AND
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN I FORGAVE HER
SHE NOW LOVES ME AND WOULD
NOT DEFRAUD ME OF A PIN
CONFIDENCE HAS MADE HER HONEST FORBEARANCE HAS
MADE HER KIND HEARTED
AT THIS DAY I CAN TRUST BOTH HER INTEGRITY HER
COURAGE AND HER AFFECTION
CALL HER BUT KEEP MY GOOD AUNT AND MY TIMID
COUSINS AWAY
ONCE MORE PROMISE
I PROMISE
THAT IS GOOD IN YOU SHE SAID LOOKING UP AT HIM AS HE BENT OVER HER
AND SMILING
IS IT GOOD DOES IT COMFORT
VERY MUCH
I WILL BE WITH YOU I AND MRS
GILL ONLY IN ANY IN EVERY EXTREMITY
WHERE CALM AND FIDELITY ARE NEEDED
NO RASH OR COWARD HAND SHALL
MEDDLE
YET YOU THINK ME CHILDISH
I DO
AH YOU DESPISE ME
DO WE DESPISE CHILDREN
IN FACT I AM NEITHER SO STRONG NOR HAVE I SUCH PRIDE IN MY STRENGTH
AS PEOPLE THINK MR
MOORE NOR AM I SO REGARDLESS OF SYMPATHY
BUT WHEN
I HAVE ANY GRIEF I FEAR TO IMPART IT TO THOSE I LOVE LEST IT SHOULD
PAIN THEM AND TO THOSE WHOM I VIEW WITH INDIFFERENCE I CANNOT
CONDESCEND TO COMPLAIN
AFTER ALL YOU SHOULD NOT TAUNT ME WITH BEING
CHILDISH FOR IF YOU WERE AS UNHAPPY AS I HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST THREE
WEEKS YOU TOO WOULD WANT SOME FRIEND
WE ALL WANT A FRIEND DO WE NOT
ALL OF US THAT HAVE ANYTHING GOOD IN OUR NATURES
WELL YOU HAVE CAROLINE HELSTONE
YES
AND YOU HAVE MR
HALL
YES
MRS
PRYOR IS A WISE GOOD WOMAN
SHE CAN COUNSEL YOU WHEN YOU
NEED COUNSEL
FOR YOUR PART YOU HAVE YOUR BROTHER ROBERT
FOR ANY RIGHT HAND DEFECTIONS THERE IS THE REV
MATTHEWSON HELSTONE
M A TO LEAN UPON FOR ANY LEFT HAND FALLINGS OFF THERE IS HIRAM YORKE
ESQ
BOTH ELDERS PAY YOU HOMAGE
I NEVER SAW MRS
YORKE SO MOTHERLY TO ANY YOUNG MAN AS SHE IS TO YOU
I
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HAVE WON HER HEART BUT SHE IS MORE TENDER TO YOU
THAN SHE IS TO HER OWN SONS
YOU HAVE BESIDES YOUR SISTER HORTENSE
IT APPEARS WE ARE BOTH WELL PROVIDED
IT APPEARS SO
HOW THANKFUL WE OUGHT TO BE
YES
HOW CONTENTED
YES
FOR MY PART I AM ALMOST CONTENTED JUST NOW AND VERY THANKFUL
GRATITUDE IS A DIVINE EMOTION
IT FILLS THE HEART BUT NOT TO BURSTING
IT WARMS IT BUT NOT TO FEVER
I LIKE TO TASTE LEISURELY OF BLISS
DEVOURED IN HASTE I DO NOT KNOW ITS FLAVOUR
STILL LEANING ON THE BACK OF MISS KEELDAR'S CHAIR MOORE WATCHED THE
RAPID MOTION OF HER FINGERS AS THE GREEN AND PURPLE GARLAND GREW
BENEATH THEM
AFTER A PROLONGED PAUSE HE AGAIN ASKED IS THE SHADOW
QUITE GONE
WHOLLY
AS I WAS TWO HOURS SINCE AND AS I AM NOW ARE TWO
DIFFERENT STATES OF EXISTENCE
I BELIEVE MR
MOORE GRIEFS AND FEARS
NURSED IN SILENCE GROW LIKE TITAN INFANTS
YOU WILL CHERISH SUCH FEELINGS NO MORE IN SILENCE
NOT IF I DARE SPEAK
IN USING THE WORD DARE TO WHOM DO YOU ALLUDE
TO YOU
HOW IS IT APPLICABLE TO ME
ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR AUSTERITY AND SHYNESS
WHY AM I AUSTERE AND SHY
BECAUSE YOU ARE PROUD
WHY AM I PROUD
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO TELL ME
PERHAPS BECAUSE I AM POOR FOR ONE REASON
POVERTY AND PRIDE OFTEN GO
TOGETHER
THAT IS SUCH A NICE REASON
I SHOULD BE CHARMED TO DISCOVER ANOTHER
THAT WOULD PAIR WITH IT
MATE THAT TURTLE MR
MOORE
IMMEDIATELY
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MARRYING TO SOBER POVERTY MANY TINTED
CAPRICE
ARE YOU CAPRICIOUS
YOU ARE
A LIBEL
I AM STEADY AS A ROCK FIXED AS THE POLAR STAR
I LOOK OUT AT SOME EARLY HOUR OF THE DAY AND SEE A FINE PERFECT
RAINBOW BRIGHT WITH PROMISE GLORIOUSLY SPANNING THE BECLOUDED WELKIN
OF LIFE
AN HOUR AFTERWARDS I LOOK AGAIN HALF THE ARCH IS GONE AND THE
REST IS FADED
STILL LATER THE STERN SKY DENIES THAT IT EVER WORE SO
BENIGN A SYMBOL OF HOPE
WELL MR
MOORE YOU SHOULD CONTEND AGAINST THESE CHANGEFUL HUMOURS
THEY ARE YOUR BESETTING SIN
ONE NEVER KNOWS WHERE TO HAVE YOU
MISS KEELDAR I HAD ONCE FOR TWO YEARS A PUPIL WHO GREW VERY DEAR TO
ME
HENRY IS DEAR BUT SHE WAS DEARER
HENRY NEVER GIVES ME TROUBLE
SHE WELL SHE DID
I THINK SHE VEXED ME TWENTY THREE HOURS OUT OF THE
TWENTY FOUR
SHE WAS NEVER WITH YOU ABOVE THREE HOURS OR AT THE MOST SIX AT A
TIME
SHE SOMETIMES SPILLED THE DRAUGHT FROM MY CUP AND STOLE THE FOOD FROM
MY PLATE AND WHEN SHE HAD KEPT ME UNFED FOR A DAY AND THAT DID NOT
SUIT ME FOR I AM A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE MY MEALS WITH REASONABLE
RELISH AND TO ASCRIBE DUE IMPORTANCE TO THE RATIONAL ENJOYMENT OF
CREATURE COMFORTS
I KNOW YOU DO
I CAN TELL WHAT SORT OF DINNERS YOU LIKE BEST PERFECTLY
WELL
I KNOW PRECISELY THE DISHES YOU PREFER
SHE ROBBED THESE DISHES OF FLAVOUR AND MADE A FOOL OF ME BESIDES
I
LIKE TO SLEEP WELL
IN MY QUIET DAYS WHEN I WAS MY OWN MAN I NEVER
QUARRELLED WITH THE NIGHT FOR BEING LONG NOR CURSED MY BED FOR ITS
THORNS
SHE CHANGED ALL THIS
MR
MOORE
AND HAVING TAKEN FROM ME PEACE OF MIND AND EASE OF LIFE SHE TOOK FROM
ME HERSELF QUITE COOLLY JUST AS IF WHEN SHE WAS GONE THE WORLD WOULD
BE ALL THE SAME TO ME
I KNEW I SHOULD SEE HER AGAIN AT SOME TIME
AT
THE END OF TWO YEARS IT FELL OUT THAT WE ENCOUNTERED AGAIN UNDER HER
OWN ROOF WHERE SHE WAS MISTRESS
HOW DO YOU THINK SHE BORE HERSELF
TOWARDS ME MISS KEELDAR
LIKE ONE WHO HAD PROFITED WELL BY LESSONS LEARNED FROM YOURSELF
SHE RECEIVED ME HAUGHTILY
SHE METED OUT A WIDE SPACE BETWEEN US AND
KEPT ME ALOOF BY THE RESERVED GESTURE THE RARE AND ALIENATED GLANCE
THE WORD CALMLY CIVIL
SHE WAS AN EXCELLENT PUPIL HAVING SEEN YOU DISTANT SHE AT ONCE
LEARNED TO WITHDRAW
PRAY SIR ADMIRE IN HER HAUTEUR A CAREFUL
IMPROVEMENT ON YOUR OWN COOLNESS
CONSCIENCE AND HONOUR AND THE MOST DESPOTIC NECESSITY DRAGGED ME
APART FROM HER AND KEPT ME SUNDERED WITH PONDEROUS FETTERS
SHE WAS
FREE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CLEMENT
NEVER FREE TO COMPROMISE HER SELF RESPECT TO SEEK WHERE SHE HAD BEEN
SHUNNED
THEN SHE WAS INCONSISTENT SHE TANTALIZED AS BEFORE
WHEN I THOUGHT I
HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO SEEING IN HER ONLY A LOFTY STRANGER SHE WOULD
SUDDENLY SHOW ME SUCH A GLIMPSE OF LOVING SIMPLICITY SHE WOULD WARM ME
WITH SUCH A BEAM OF REVIVING SYMPATHY SHE WOULD GLADDEN AN HOUR WITH
CONVERSE SO GENTLE GAY AND KINDLY THAT I COULD NO MORE SHUT MY HEART
ON HER IMAGE THAN I COULD CLOSE THAT DOOR AGAINST HER PRESENCE
EXPLAIN
WHY SHE DISTRESSED ME SO
SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO BE QUITE OUTCAST AND THEN SHE WOULD SOMETIMES
GET A NOTION INTO HER HEAD ON A COLD WET DAY THAT THE SCHOOLROOM WAS
NO CHEERFUL PLACE AND FEEL IT INCUMBENT ON HER TO GO AND SEE IF YOU AND
HENRY KEPT UP A GOOD FIRE AND ONCE THERE SHE LIKED TO STAY
BUT SHE SHOULD NOT BE CHANGEFUL
IF SHE CAME AT ALL SHE SHOULD COME
OFTENER
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS INTRUSION
TO MORROW YOU WILL NOT BE AS YOU ARE TO DAY
I DON'T KNOW
WILL YOU
I AM NOT MAD MOST NOBLE BERENICE WE MAY GIVE ONE DAY TO DREAMING BUT
THE NEXT WE MUST AWAKE AND I SHALL AWAKE TO PURPOSE THE MORNING YOU ARE
MARRIED TO SIR PHILIP NUNNELY
THE FIRE SHINES ON YOU AND ME AND SHOWS
US VERY CLEARLY IN THE GLASS MISS KEELDAR AND I HAVE BEEN GAZING ON
THE PICTURE ALL THE TIME I HAVE BEEN TALKING
LOOK UP WHAT A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOUR HEAD AND MINE I LOOK OLD FOR THIRTY
YOU ARE SO GRAVE YOU HAVE SUCH A SQUARE BROW AND YOUR FACE IS SALLOW
I NEVER REGARD YOU AS A YOUNG MAN NOR AS ROBERT'S JUNIOR
DON'T YOU I THOUGHT NOT
IMAGINE ROBERT'S CLEAR CUT HANDSOME FACE
LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER
DOES NOT THE APPARITION MAKE VIVIDLY MANIFEST
THE OBTUSE MOULD OF MY HEAVY TRAITS THERE HE STARTED I HAVE BEEN
EXPECTING THAT WIRE TO VIBRATE THIS LAST HALF HOUR
THE DINNER BELL RANG AND SHIRLEY ROSE
MR
MOORE SHE SAID AS SHE GATHERED UP HER SILKS HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM YOUR BROTHER LATELY DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE MEANS BY STAYING IN TOWN
SO LONG DOES HE TALK OF RETURNING
HE TALKS OF RETURNING BUT WHAT HAS CAUSED HIS LONG ABSENCE I CANNOT
TELL
TO SPEAK THE TRUTH I THOUGHT NONE IN YORKSHIRE KNEW BETTER THAN
YOURSELF WHY HE WAS RELUCTANT TO COME HOME
A CRIMSON SHADOW PASSED ACROSS MISS KEELDAR'S CHEEK
WRITE TO HIM AND URGE HIM TO COME SHE SAID
I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN NO
IMPOLICY IN PROTRACTING HIS ABSENCE THUS FAR
IT IS GOOD TO LET THE MILL
STAND WHILE TRADE IS SO BAD BUT HE MUST NOT ABANDON THE COUNTY
I AM AWARE SAID LOUIS THAT HE HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU THE EVENING
BEFORE HE LEFT AND I SAW HIM QUIT FIELDHEAD AFTERWARDS
I READ HIS
COUNTENANCE OR TRIED TO READ IT
HE TURNED FROM ME
I DIVINED THAT HE
WOULD BE LONG AWAY
SOME FINE SLIGHT FINGERS HAVE A WONDROUS KNACK AT
PULVERIZING A MAN'S BRITTLE PRIDE
I SUPPOSE ROBERT PUT TOO MUCH TRUST
IN HIS MANLY BEAUTY AND NATIVE GENTLEMANHOOD
THOSE ARE BETTER OFF WHO
BEING DESTITUTE OF ADVANTAGE CANNOT CHERISH DELUSION
BUT I WILL WRITE
AND SAY YOU ADVISE HIS RETURN
DO NOT SAY I ADVISE HIS RETURN BUT THAT HIS RETURN IS ADVISABLE
THE SECOND BELL RANG AND MISS KEELDAR OBEYED ITS CALL
CHAPTER XXIX
LOUIS MOORE
LOUIS MOORE WAS USED TO A QUIET LIFE
BEING A QUIET MAN HE ENDURED IT
BETTER THAN MOST MEN WOULD
HAVING A LARGE WORLD OF HIS OWN IN HIS OWN
HEAD AND HEART HE TOLERATED CONFINEMENT TO A SMALL STILL CORNER OF THE
REAL WORLD VERY PATIENTLY
HOW HUSHED IS FIELDHEAD THIS EVENING ALL BUT MOORE MISS KEELDAR THE
WHOLE FAMILY OF THE SYMPSONS EVEN HENRY ARE GONE TO NUNNELY
SIR
PHILIP WOULD HAVE THEM COME HE WISHED TO MAKE THEM ACQUAINTED WITH HIS
MOTHER AND SISTERS WHO ARE NOW AT THE PRIORY
KIND GENTLEMAN AS THE
BARONET IS HE ASKED THE TUTOR TOO BUT THE TUTOR WOULD MUCH SOONER HAVE
MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE GHOST OF THE EARL OF HUNTINGDON TO MEET
HIM AND A SHADOWY RING OF HIS MERRY MEN UNDER THE CANOPY OF THE
THICKEST BLACKEST OLDEST OAK IN NUNNELY FOREST
YES HE WOULD RATHER
HAVE APPOINTED TRYST WITH A PHANTOM ABBESS OR MIST PALE NUN AMONG THE
WET AND WEEDY RELICS OF THAT RUINED SANCTUARY OF THEIRS MOULDERING IN
THE CORE OF THE WOOD
LOUIS MOORE LONGS TO HAVE SOMETHING NEAR HIM
TO NIGHT BUT NOT THE BOY BARONET NOR HIS BENEVOLENT BUT STERN MOTHER
NOR HIS PATRICIAN SISTERS NOR ONE SOUL OF THE SYMPSONS
THIS NIGHT IS NOT CALM THE EQUINOX STILL STRUGGLES IN ITS STORMS
THE
WILD RAINS OF THE DAY ARE ABATED THE GREAT SINGLE CLOUD DISPARTS AND
ROLLS AWAY FROM HEAVEN NOT PASSING AND LEAVING A SEA ALL SAPPHIRE BUT
TOSSED BUOYANT BEFORE A CONTINUED LONG SOUNDING HIGH RUSHING MOONLIGHT
TEMPEST
THE MOON REIGNS GLORIOUS GLAD OF THE GALE AS GLAD AS IF SHE
GAVE HERSELF TO HIS FIERCE CARESS WITH LOVE
NO ENDYMION WILL WATCH FOR
HIS GODDESS TO NIGHT
THERE ARE NO FLOCKS OUT ON THE MOUNTAINS AND IT
IS WELL FOR TO NIGHT SHE WELCOMES OLUS
MOORE SITTING IN THE SCHOOLROOM HEARD THE STORM ROAR ROUND THE OTHER
GABLE AND ALONG THE HALL FRONT
THIS END WAS SHELTERED
HE WANTED NO
SHELTER HE DESIRED NO SUBDUED SOUNDS OR SCREENED POSITION
ALL THE PARLOURS ARE EMPTY SAID HE
I AM SICK AT HEART OF THIS
CELL
HE LEFT IT AND WENT WHERE THE CASEMENTS LARGER AND FREER THAN THE
BRANCH SCREENED LATTICE OF HIS OWN APARTMENT ADMITTED UNIMPEDED THE
DARK BLUE THE SILVER FLEECED THE STIRRING AND SWEEPING VISION OF THE
AUTUMN NIGHT SKY
HE CARRIED NO CANDLE UNNEEDED WAS LAMP OR FIRE
THE
BROAD AND CLEAR THOUGH CLOUD CROSSED AND FLUCTUATING BEAM OF THE MOON
SHONE ON EVERY FLOOR AND WALL
MOORE WANDERS THROUGH ALL THE ROOMS
HE SEEMS FOLLOWING A PHANTOM FROM
PARLOUR TO PARLOUR
IN THE OAK ROOM HE STOPS
THIS IS NOT CHILL AND
POLISHED AND FIRELESS LIKE THE SALON
THE HEARTH IS HOT AND RUDDY
THE CINDERS TINKLE IN THE INTENSE HEAT OF THEIR CLEAR GLOW NEAR THE RUG
IS A LITTLE WORK TABLE A DESK UPON IT A CHAIR NEAR IT
DOES THE VISION MOORE HAS TRACKED OCCUPY THAT CHAIR YOU WOULD THINK SO
COULD YOU SEE HIM STANDING BEFORE IT
THERE IS AS MUCH INTEREST NOW IN
HIS EYE AND AS MUCH SIGNIFICANCE IN HIS FACE AS IF IN THIS HOUSEHOLD
SOLITUDE HE HAD FOUND A LIVING COMPANION AND WAS GOING TO SPEAK TO IT
HE MAKES DISCOVERIES
A BAG A SMALL SATIN BAG HANGS ON THE CHAIR BACK
THE DESK IS OPEN THE KEYS ARE IN THE LOCK
A PRETTY SEAL A SILVER PEN
A CRIMSON BERRY OR TWO OF RIPE FRUIT ON A GREEN LEAF A SMALL CLEAN
DELICATE GLOVE THESE TRIFLES AT ONCE DECORATE AND DISARRANGE THE STAND
THEY STREW
ORDER FORBIDS DETAILS IN A PICTURE SHE PUTS THEM TIDILY
AWAY BUT DETAILS GIVE CHARM
MOORE SPOKE
HER MARK HE SAID
HERE SHE HAS BEEN CARELESS ATTRACTIVE
THING CALLED AWAY IN HASTE DOUBTLESS AND FORGETTING TO RETURN AND
PUT ALL TO RIGHTS
WHY DOES SHE LEAVE FASCINATION IN HER FOOTPRINTS
WHENCE DID SHE ACQUIRE THE GIFT TO BE HEEDLESS AND NEVER OFFEND THERE
IS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO CHIDE IN HER AND THE REPRIMAND NEVER SETTLES IN
DISPLEASURE ON THE HEART BUT FOR HER LOVER OR HER HUSBAND WHEN IT HAD
TRICKLED A WHILE IN WORDS WOULD NATURALLY MELT FROM HIS LIPS IN A KISS
BETTER PASS HALF AN HOUR IN REMONSTRATING WITH HER THAN A DAY IN
ADMIRING OR PRAISING ANY OTHER WOMAN ALIVE
AM I MUTTERING
SOLILOQUIZING STOP THAT
HE DID STOP IT
HE STOOD THINKING AND THEN HE MADE AN ARRANGEMENT FOR
HIS EVENING'S COMFORT
HE DROPPED THE CURTAINS OVER THE BROAD WINDOW AND REGAL MOON
HE SHUT
OUT SOVEREIGN AND COURT AND STARRY ARMIES HE ADDED FUEL TO THE HOT BUT
FAST WASTING FIRE HE LIT A CANDLE OF WHICH THERE WERE A PAIR ON THE
TABLE HE PLACED ANOTHER CHAIR OPPOSITE THAT NEAR THE WORKSTAND AND
THEN HE SAT DOWN
HIS NEXT MOVEMENT WAS TO TAKE FROM HIS POCKET A SMALL
THICK BOOK OF BLANK PAPER TO PRODUCE A PENCIL AND TO BEGIN TO WRITE IN
A CRAMP COMPACT HAND
COME NEAR BY ALL MEANS READER
DO NOT BE SHY
STOOP OVER HIS SHOULDER FEARLESSLY AND READ AS HE SCRIBBLES
IT IS NINE O'CLOCK THE CARRIAGE WILL NOT RETURN BEFORE ELEVEN I AM
CERTAIN
FREEDOM IS MINE TILL THEN TILL THEN I MAY OCCUPY HER ROOM SIT
OPPOSITE HER CHAIR REST MY ELBOW ON HER TABLE HAVE HER LITTLE
MEMENTOES ABOUT ME
I USED RATHER TO LIKE SOLITUDE TO FANCY HER A SOMEWHAT QUIET AND
SERIOUS YET FAIR NYMPH AN OREAD DESCENDING TO ME FROM LONE
MOUNTAIN PASSES SOMETHING OF THE BLUE MIST OF HILLS IN HER ARRAY AND OF
THEIR CHILL BREEZE IN HER BREATH BUT MUCH ALSO OF THEIR SOLEMN BEAUTY
IN HER MIEN
I ONCE COULD COURT HER SERENELY AND IMAGINE MY HEART
EASIER WHEN I HELD HER TO IT ALL MUTE BUT MAJESTIC
SINCE THAT DAY I CALLED S
TO ME IN THE SCHOOLROOM AND SHE CAME AND
SAT SO NEAR MY SIDE SINCE SHE OPENED THE TROUBLE OF HER MIND TO ME
ASKED MY PROTECTION APPEALED TO MY STRENGTH SINCE THAT HOUR I ABHOR
SOLITUDE
COLD ABSTRACTION FLESHLESS SKELETON DAUGHTER MOTHER AND
MATE OF DEATH
IT IS PLEASANT TO WRITE ABOUT WHAT IS NEAR AND DEAR AS THE CORE OF MY
HEART
NONE CAN DEPRIVE ME OF THIS LITTLE BOOK AND THROUGH THIS PENCIL
I CAN SAY TO IT WHAT I WILL SAY WHAT I DARE UTTER TO NOTHING
LIVING SAY WHAT I DARE NOT THINK ALOUD
WE HAVE SCARCELY ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER SINCE THAT EVENING
ONCE WHEN
I WAS ALONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM SEEKING A BOOK OF HENRY'S SHE ENTERED
DRESSED FOR A CONCERT AT STILBRO'
SHYNESS HER SHYNESS NOT
MINE DREW A SILVER VEIL BETWEEN US
MUCH CANT HAVE I HEARD AND READ
ABOUT 'MAIDEN MODESTY BUT PROPERLY USED AND NOT HACKNEYED THE WORDS
ARE GOOD AND APPROPRIATE WORDS
AS SHE PASSED TO THE WINDOW AFTER
TACITLY BUT GRACEFULLY RECOGNIZING ME I COULD CALL HER NOTHING IN MY
OWN MIND SAVE 'STAINLESS VIRGIN TO MY PERCEPTION A DELICATE
SPLENDOUR ROBED HER AND THE MODESTY OF GIRLHOOD WAS HER HALO
I MAY BE
THE MOST FATUOUS AS I AM ONE OF THE PLAINEST OF MEN BUT IN TRUTH THAT
SHYNESS OF HERS TOUCHED ME EXQUISITELY IT FLATTERED MY FINEST
SENSATIONS
I LOOKED A STUPID BLOCK I DARE SAY
I WAS ALIVE WITH A LIFE
OF PARADISE AS SHE TURNED HER GLANCE FROM MY GLANCE AND SOFTLY
AVERTED HER HEAD TO HIDE THE SUFFUSION OF HER CHEEK
I KNOW THIS IS THE TALK OF A DREAMER OF A RAPT ROMANTIC LUNATIC
I
DO DREAM
I WILL DREAM NOW AND THEN AND IF SHE HAS INSPIRED ROMANCE
INTO MY PROSAIC COMPOSITION HOW CAN I HELP IT
WHAT A CHILD SHE IS SOMETIMES WHAT AN UNSOPHISTICATED UNTAUGHT THING
I SEE HER NOW LOOKING UP INTO MY FACE AND ENTREATING ME TO PREVENT THEM
FROM SMOTHERING HER AND TO BE SURE AND GIVE HER A STRONG NARCOTIC
I
SEE HER CONFESSING THAT SHE WAS NOT SO SELF SUFFICING SO INDEPENDENT OF
SYMPATHY AS PEOPLE THOUGHT
I SEE THE SECRET TEAR DROP QUIETLY FROM HER
EYELASH
SHE SAID I THOUGHT HER CHILDISH AND I DID
SHE IMAGINED I
DESPISED HER
DESPISED HER IT WAS UNUTTERABLY SWEET TO FEEL MYSELF AT
ONCE NEAR HER AND ABOVE HER TO BE CONSCIOUS OF A NATURAL RIGHT AND
POWER TO SUSTAIN HER AS A HUSBAND SHOULD SUSTAIN HIS WIFE
I WORSHIP HER PERFECTIONS BUT IT IS HER FAULTS OR AT LEAST HER
FOIBLES THAT BRING HER NEAR TO ME THAT NESTLE HER TO MY HEART THAT
FOLD HER ABOUT WITH MY LOVE AND THAT FOR A MOST SELFISH BUT
DEEPLY NATURAL REASON
THESE FAULTS ARE THE STEPS BY WHICH I MOUNT TO
ASCENDENCY OVER HER
IF SHE ROSE A TRIMMED ARTIFICIAL MOUND WITHOUT
INEQUALITY WHAT VANTAGE WOULD SHE OFFER THE FOOT IT IS THE NATURAL
HILL WITH ITS MOSSY BREAKS AND HOLLOWS WHOSE SLOPE INVITES ASCENT
WHOSE SUMMIT IT IS PLEASURE TO GAIN
TO LEAVE METAPHOR
IT DELIGHTS MY EYE TO LOOK ON HER
SHE SUITS ME
IF
I WERE A KING AND SHE THE HOUSEMAID THAT SWEPT MY PALACE STAIRS ACROSS
ALL THAT SPACE BETWEEN US MY EYE WOULD RECOGNIZE HER QUALITIES A TRUE
PULSE WOULD BEAT FOR HER IN MY HEART THOUGH AN UNSPANNED GULF MADE
ACQUAINTANCE IMPOSSIBLE
IF I WERE A GENTLEMAN AND SHE WAITED ON ME AS
A SERVANT I COULD NOT HELP LIKING THAT SHIRLEY
TAKE FROM HER HER
EDUCATION TAKE HER ORNAMENTS HER SUMPTUOUS DRESS ALL EXTRINSIC
ADVANTAGES TAKE ALL GRACE BUT SUCH AS THE SYMMETRY OF HER FORM RENDERS
INEVITABLE PRESENT HER TO ME AT A COTTAGE DOOR IN A STUFF GOWN LET
HER OFFER ME THERE A DRAUGHT OF WATER WITH THAT SMILE WITH THAT WARM
GOOD WILL WITH WHICH SHE NOW DISPENSES MANORIAL HOSPITALITY I SHOULD
LIKE HER
I SHOULD WISH TO STAY AN HOUR I SHOULD LINGER TO TALK WITH
THAT RUSTIC
I SHOULD NOT FEEL AS I NOW DO I SHOULD FIND IN HER
NOTHING DIVINE BUT WHENEVER I MET THE YOUNG PEASANT IT WOULD BE WITH
PLEASURE WHENEVER I LEFT HER IT WOULD BE WITH REGRET
HOW CULPABLY CARELESS IN HER TO LEAVE HER DESK OPEN WHERE I KNOW SHE
HAS MONEY IN THE LOCK HANG THE KEYS OF ALL HER REPOSITORIES OF HER
VERY JEWEL CASKET
THERE IS A PURSE IN THAT LITTLE SATIN BAG I SEE THE
TASSEL OF SILVER BEADS HANGING OUT
THAT SPECTACLE WOULD PROVOKE MY
BROTHER ROBERT
ALL HER LITTLE FAILINGS WOULD I KNOW BE A SOURCE OF
IRRITATION TO HIM
IF THEY VEX ME IT IS A MOST PLEASURABLE VEXATION
I
DELIGHT TO FIND HER AT FAULT AND WERE I ALWAYS RESIDENT WITH HER I AM
AWARE SHE WOULD BE NO NIGGARD IN THUS MINISTERING TO MY ENJOYMENT
SHE
WOULD JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO TO RECTIFY A THEME FOR MY TUTOR
LECTURES
I NEVER LECTURE HENRY NEVER FEEL DISPOSED TO DO SO
IF HE
DOES WRONG AND THAT IS VERY SELDOM DEAR EXCELLENT LAD A WORD
SUFFICES
OFTEN I DO NO MORE THAN SHAKE MY HEAD
BUT THE MOMENT HER
MINOIS MUTIN MEETS MY EYE EXPOSTULATORY WORDS CROWD TO MY LIPS
FROM
A TACITURN MAN I BELIEVE SHE WOULD TRANSFORM ME INTO A TALKER
WHENCE
COMES THE DELIGHT I TAKE IN THAT TALK IT PUZZLES MYSELF SOMETIMES
THE
MORE CRNE MALIN TAQUIN IS HER MOOD CONSEQUENTLY THE CLEARER
OCCASION SHE GIVES ME FOR DISAPPROBATION THE MORE I SEEK HER THE
BETTER I LIKE HER
SHE IS NEVER WILDER THAN WHEN EQUIPPED IN HER HABIT
AND HAT NEVER LESS MANAGEABLE THAN WHEN SHE AND ZO COME IN FIERY FROM
A RACE WITH THE WIND ON THE HILLS AND I CONFESS IT TO THIS MUTE PAGE I
MAY CONFESS IT I HAVE WAITED AN HOUR IN THE COURT FOR THE CHANCE OF
WITNESSING HER RETURN AND FOR THE DEARER CHANCE OF RECEIVING HER IN MY
ARMS FROM THE SADDLE
I HAVE NOTICED AGAIN IT IS TO THIS PAGE ONLY I
WOULD MAKE THE REMARK THAT SHE WILL NEVER PERMIT ANY MAN BUT MYSELF TO
RENDER HER THAT ASSISTANCE
I HAVE SEEN HER POLITELY DECLINE SIR PHILIP
NUNNELY'S AID
SHE IS ALWAYS MIGHTY GENTLE WITH HER YOUNG BARONET
MIGHTY TENDER FOR HIS FEELINGS FORSOOTH AND OF HIS VERY THIN SKINNED
AMOUR PROPRE
I HAVE MARKED HER HAUGHTILY REJECT SAM WYNNE'S
NOW I
KNOW MY HEART KNOWS IT FOR IT HAS FELT IT THAT SHE RESIGNS HERSELF TO
ME UNRELUCTANTLY
IS SHE CONSCIOUS HOW MY STRENGTH REJOICES TO SERVE
HER I MYSELF AM NOT HER SLAVE I DECLARE IT BUT MY FACULTIES GATHER
TO HER BEAUTY LIKE THE GENII TO THE GLISTEN OF THE LAMP
ALL MY
KNOWLEDGE ALL MY PRUDENCE ALL MY CALM AND ALL MY POWER STAND IN HER
PRESENCE HUMBLY WAITING A TASK
HOW GLAD THEY ARE WHEN A MANDATE COMES
WHAT JOY THEY TAKE IN THE TOILS SHE ASSIGNS DOES SHE KNOW IT
I HAVE CALLED HER CARELESS
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT HER CARELESSNESS
NEVER COMPROMISES HER REFINEMENT
INDEED THROUGH THIS VERY LOOPHOLE OF
CHARACTER THE REALITY DEPTH GENUINENESS OF THAT REFINEMENT MAY BE
ASCERTAINED
A WHOLE GARMENT SOMETIMES COVERS MEAGRENESS AND
MALFORMATION THROUGH A RENT SLEEVE A FAIR ROUND ARM MAY BE REVEALED
I
HAVE SEEN AND HANDLED MANY OF HER POSSESSIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE
FREQUENTLY ASTRAY
I NEVER SAW ANYTHING THAT DID NOT PROCLAIM THE
LADY NOTHING SORDID NOTHING SOILED
IN ONE SENSE SHE IS AS SCRUPULOUS
AS IN ANOTHER SHE IS UNTHINKING
AS A PEASANT GIRL SHE WOULD GO EVER
TRIM AND CLEANLY
LOOK AT THE PURE KID OF THIS LITTLE GLOVE AT THE
FRESH UNSULLIED SATIN OF THE BAG
WHAT A DIFFERENCE THERE IS BETWEEN S
AND THAT PEARL C
H CAROLINE I
FANCY IS THE SOUL OF CONSCIENTIOUS PUNCTUALITY AND NICE EXACTITUDE
SHE
WOULD PRECISELY SUIT THE DOMESTIC HABITS OF A CERTAIN FASTIDIOUS KINSMAN
OF MINE SO DELICATE DEXTEROUS QUAINT QUICK QUIET ALL DONE TO A
MINUTE ALL ARRANGED TO A STRAWBREADTH
SHE WOULD SUIT ROBERT
BUT WHAT
COULD I DO WITH ANYTHING SO NEARLY FAULTLESS SHE IS MY EQUAL POOR
AS MYSELF
SHE IS CERTAINLY PRETTY A LITTLE RAFFAELLE HEAD
HERS RAFFAELLE IN FEATURE QUITE ENGLISH IN EXPRESSION ALL INSULAR
GRACE AND PURITY BUT WHERE IS THERE ANYTHING TO ALTER ANYTHING TO
ENDURE ANYTHING TO REPRIMAND TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT THERE SHE IS A LILY
OF THE VALLEY UNTINTED NEEDING NO TINT
WHAT CHANGE COULD IMPROVE HER
WHAT PENCIL DARE TO PAINT MY SWEETHEART IF I EVER HAVE ONE MUST
BEAR NEARER AFFINITY TO THE ROSE A SWEET LIVELY DELIGHT GUARDED WITH
PRICKLY PERIL
MY WIFE IF I EVER MARRY MUST STIR MY GREAT FRAME WITH
A STING NOW AND THEN SHE MUST FURNISH USE TO HER HUSBAND'S VAST MASS OF
PATIENCE
I WAS NOT MADE SO ENDURING TO BE MATED WITH A LAMB I SHOULD
FIND MORE CONGENIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE CHARGE OF A YOUNG LIONESS OR
LEOPARDESS
I LIKE FEW THINGS SWEET BUT WHAT ARE LIKEWISE PUNGENT FEW
THINGS BRIGHT BUT WHAT ARE LIKEWISE HOT
I LIKE THE SUMMER DAY WHOSE
SUN MAKES FRUIT BLUSH AND CORN BLANCH
BEAUTY IS NEVER SO BEAUTIFUL AS
WHEN IF I TEASE IT IT WREATHES BACK ON ME WITH SPIRIT
FASCINATION IS
NEVER SO IMPERIAL AS WHEN ROUSED AND HALF IREFUL SHE THREATENS
TRANSFORMATION TO FIERCENESS
I FEAR I SHOULD TIRE OF THE MUTE
MONOTONOUS INNOCENCE OF THE LAMB I SHOULD ERE LONG FEEL AS BURDENSOME
THE NESTLING DOVE WHICH NEVER STIRRED IN MY BOSOM BUT MY PATIENCE WOULD
EXULT IN STILLING THE FLUTTERINGS AND TRAINING THE ENERGIES OF THE
RESTLESS MERLIN
IN MANAGING THE WILD INSTINCTS OF THE SCARCE MANAGEABLE
BTE FAUVE MY POWERS WOULD REVEL
O MY PUPIL O PERI TOO MUTINOUS FOR HEAVEN TOO INNOCENT FOR HELL
NEVER SHALL I DO MORE THAN SEE AND WORSHIP AND WISH FOR THEE
ALAS
KNOWING I COULD MAKE THEE HAPPY WILL IT BE MY DOOM TO SEE THEE
POSSESSED BY THOSE WHO HAVE NOT THAT POWER
HOWEVER KINDLY THE HAND IF IT IS FEEBLE IT CANNOT BEND SHIRLEY AND
SHE MUST BE BENT
IT CANNOT CURB HER AND SHE MUST BE CURBED
BEWARE SIR PHILIP NUNNELY I NEVER SEE YOU WALKING OR SITTING AT HER
SIDE AND OBSERVE HER LIPS COMPRESSED OR HER BROW KNIT IN RESOLUTE
ENDURANCE OF SOME TRAIT OF YOUR CHARACTER WHICH SHE NEITHER ADMIRES NOR
LIKES IN DETERMINED TOLERATION OF SOME WEAKNESS SHE BELIEVES ATONED FOR
BY A VIRTUE BUT WHICH ANNOYS HER DESPITE THAT BELIEF I NEVER MARK THE
GRAVE GLOW OF HER FACE THE UNSMILING SPARKLE OF HER EYE THE SLIGHT
RECOIL OF HER WHOLE FRAME WHEN YOU DRAW A LITTLE TOO NEAR AND GAZE A
LITTLE TOO EXPRESSIVELY AND WHISPER A LITTLE TOO WARMLY I NEVER
WITNESS THESE THINGS BUT I THINK OF THE FABLE OF SEMELE REVERSED
IT IS NOT THE DAUGHTER OF CADMUS I SEE NOR DO I REALIZE HER FATAL
LONGING TO LOOK ON JOVE IN THE MAJESTY OF HIS GOD HEAD
IT IS A PRIEST
OF JUNO THAT STANDS BEFORE ME WATCHING LATE AND LONE AT A SHRINE IN AN
ARGIVE TEMPLE
FOR YEARS OF SOLITARY MINISTRY HE HAS LIVED ON DREAMS
THERE IS DIVINE MADNESS UPON HIM
HE LOVES THE IDOL HE SERVES AND PRAYS
DAY AND NIGHT THAT HIS FRENZY MAY BE FED AND THAT THE OX EYED MAY SMILE
ON HER VOTARY
SHE HAS HEARD SHE WILL BE PROPITIOUS
ALL ARGOS
SLUMBERS
THE DOORS OF THE TEMPLE ARE SHUT THE PRIEST WAITS AT THE
ALTAR
A SHOCK OF HEAVEN AND EARTH IS FELT NOT BY THE SLUMBERING CITY ONLY
BY THAT LONELY WATCHER BRAVE AND UNSHAKEN IN HIS FANATICISM
IN THE
MIDST OF SILENCE WITH NO PRELUDING SOUND HE IS WRAPPED IN SUDDEN
LIGHT
THROUGH THE ROOF THROUGH THE RENT WIDE YAWNING VAST
WHITE BLAZING BLUE OF HEAVEN ABOVE POURS A WONDROUS DESCENT DREAD AS
THE DOWNRUSHING OF STARS
HE HAS WHAT HE ASKED
WITHDRAW FORBEAR TO
LOOK I AM BLINDED
I HEAR IN THAT FANE AN UNSPEAKABLE SOUND
WOULD THAT
I COULD NOT HEAR IT I SEE AN INSUFFERABLE GLORY BURNING TERRIBLY
BETWEEN THE PILLARS
GODS BE MERCIFUL AND QUENCH IT
A PIOUS ARGIVE ENTERS TO MAKE AN EARLY OFFERING IN THE COOL DAWN OF
MORNING
THERE WAS THUNDER IN THE NIGHT THE BOLT FELL HERE
THE SHRINE
IS SHIVERED THE MARBLE PAVEMENT ROUND SPLIT AND BLACKENED
SATURNIA'S
STATUE RISES CHASTE GRAND UNTOUCHED AT HER FEET PILED ASHES LIE PALE
NO PRIEST REMAINS HE WHO WATCHED WILL BE SEEN NO MORE
THERE IS THE CARRIAGE LET ME LOCK UP THE DESK AND POCKET THE KEYS
SHE
WILL BE SEEKING THEM TO MORROW SHE WILL HAVE TO COME TO ME
I HEAR HER
'MR
MOORE HAVE YOU SEEN MY KEYS
SO SHE WILL SAY IN HER CLEAR VOICE SPEAKING WITH RELUCTANCE LOOKING
ASHAMED CONSCIOUS THAT THIS IS THE TWENTIETH TIME OF ASKING
I WILL
TANTALIZE HER KEEP HER WITH ME EXPECTING DOUBTING AND WHEN I DO
RESTORE THEM IT SHALL NOT BE WITHOUT A LECTURE
HERE IS THE BAG TOO
AND THE PURSE THE GLOVE PEN SEAL
SHE SHALL WRING THEM ALL OUT OF ME
SLOWLY AND SEPARATELY ONLY BY CONFESSION PENITENCE ENTREATY
I NEVER
CAN TOUCH HER HAND OR A RINGLET OF HER HEAD OR A RIBBON OF HER DRESS
BUT I WILL MAKE PRIVILEGES FOR MYSELF
EVERY FEATURE OF HER FACE HER
BRIGHT EYES HER LIPS SHALL GO THROUGH EACH CHANGE THEY KNOW FOR MY
PLEASURE DISPLAY EACH EXQUISITE VARIETY OF GLANCE AND CURVE TO
DELIGHT THRILL PERHAPS MORE HOPELESSLY TO ENCHAIN ME
IF I MUST BE HER
SLAVE I WILL NOT LOSE MY FREEDOM FOR NOTHING
HE LOCKED THE DESK POCKETED ALL THE PROPERTY AND WENT
CHAPTER XXX
RUSHEDGE A CONFESSIONAL
EVERYBODY SAID IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR MR
MOORE TO RETURN HOME
ALL
BRIARFIELD WONDERED AT HIS STRANGE ABSENCE AND WHINBURY AND NUNNELY
BROUGHT EACH ITS SEPARATE CONTRIBUTION OF AMAZEMENT
WAS IT KNOWN WHY HE STAYED AWAY YES
IT WAS KNOWN TWENTY FORTY TIMES
OVER THERE BEING AT LEAST FORTY PLAUSIBLE REASONS ADDUCED TO ACCOUNT
FOR THE UNACCOUNTABLE CIRCUMSTANCE
BUSINESS IT WAS NOT THAT THE
GOSSIPS AGREED
HE HAD ACHIEVED THE BUSINESS ON WHICH HE DEPARTED LONG
AGO
HIS FOUR RINGLEADERS HE HAD SOON SCENTED OUT AND RUN DOWN
HE HAD
ATTENDED THEIR TRIAL HEARD THEIR CONVICTION AND SENTENCE AND SEEN THEM
SAFELY SHIPPED PRIOR TO TRANSPORTATION
THIS WAS KNOWN AT BRIARFIELD
THE NEWSPAPERS HAD REPORTED IT
THE
STILBRO' COURIER HAD GIVEN EVERY PARTICULAR WITH AMPLIFICATIONS
NONE
APPLAUDED HIS PERSEVERANCE OR HAILED HIS SUCCESS THOUGH THE MILL OWNERS
WERE GLAD OF IT TRUSTING THAT THE TERRORS OF LAW VINDICATED WOULD
HENCEFORWARD PARALYZE THE SINISTER VALOUR OF DISAFFECTION
DISAFFECTION
HOWEVER WAS STILL HEARD MUTTERING TO HIMSELF
HE SWORE OMINOUS OATHS
OVER THE DRUGGED BEER OF ALEHOUSES AND DRANK STRANGE TOASTS IN FIERY
BRITISH GIN
ONE REPORT AFFIRMED THAT MOORE DARED NOT COME TO YORKSHIRE HE KNEW
HIS LIFE WAS NOT WORTH AN HOUR'S PURCHASE IF HE DID
I'LL TELL HIM THAT SAID MR
YORKE WHEN HIS FOREMAN MENTIONED THE
RUMOUR AND IF THAT DOES NOT BRING HIM HOME FULL GALLOP NOTHING
WILL
EITHER THAT OR SOME OTHER MOTIVE PREVAILED AT LAST TO RECALL HIM
HE
ANNOUNCED TO JOE SCOTT THE DAY HE SHOULD ARRIVE AT STILBRO' DESIRING
HIS HACKNEY TO BE SENT TO THE GEORGE FOR HIS ACCOMMODATION AND JOE
SCOTT HAVING INFORMED MR
YORKE THAT GENTLEMAN MADE IT IN HIS WAY TO
MEET HIM
IT WAS MARKET DAY
MOORE ARRIVED IN TIME TO TAKE HIS USUAL PLACE AT THE
MARKET DINNER
AS SOMETHING OF A STRANGER AND AS A MAN OF NOTE AND
ACTION THE ASSEMBLED MANUFACTURERS RECEIVED HIM WITH A CERTAIN
DISTINCTION
SOME WHO IN PUBLIC WOULD SCARCELY HAVE DARED TO
ACKNOWLEDGE HIS ACQUAINTANCE LEST A LITTLE OF THE HATE AND VENGEANCE
LAID UP IN STORE FOR HIM SHOULD PERCHANCE HAVE FALLEN ON THEM IN
PRIVATE HAILED HIM AS IN SOME SORT THEIR CHAMPION
WHEN THE WINE HAD
CIRCULATED THEIR RESPECT WOULD HAVE KINDLED TO ENTHUSIASM HAD NOT
MOORE'S UNSHAKEN NONCHALANCE HELD IT IN A DAMP LOW SMOULDERING STATE
MR
YORKE THE PERMANENT PRESIDENT OF THESE DINNERS WITNESSED HIS YOUNG
FRIEND'S BEARING WITH EXCEEDING COMPLACENCY
IF ONE THING COULD STIR HIS
TEMPER OR EXCITE HIS CONTEMPT MORE THAN ANOTHER IT WAS TO SEE A MAN
BEFOOLED BY FLATTERY OR ELATE WITH POPULARITY
IF ONE THING SMOOTHED
SOOTHED AND CHARMED HIM ESPECIALLY IT WAS THE SPECTACLE OF A PUBLIC
CHARACTER INCAPABLE OF RELISHING HIS PUBLICITY INCAPABLE I SAY
DISDAIN WOULD BUT HAVE INCENSED IT WAS INDIFFERENCE THAT APPEASED HIS
ROUGH SPIRIT
ROBERT LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR QUIET AND ALMOST SURLY WHILE THE
CLOTHIERS AND BLANKET MAKERS VAUNTED HIS PROWESS AND REHEARSED HIS
DEEDS MANY OF THEM INTERSPERSING THEIR FLATTERIES WITH COARSE
INVECTIVES AGAINST THE OPERATIVE CLASS WAS A DELECTABLE SIGHT FOR MR
YORKE
HIS HEART TINGLED WITH THE PLEASING CONVICTION THAT THESE GROSS
EULOGIUMS SHAMED MOORE DEEPLY AND MADE HIM HALF SCORN HIMSELF AND HIS
WORK
ON ABUSE ON REPROACH ON CALUMNY IT IS EASY TO SMILE BUT
PAINFUL INDEED IS THE PANEGYRIC OF THOSE WE CONTEMN
OFTEN HAD MOORE
GAZED WITH A BRILLIANT COUNTENANCE OVER HOWLING CROWDS FROM A HOSTILE
HUSTINGS
HE HAD BREASTED THE STORM OF UNPOPULARITY WITH GALLANT BEARING
AND SOUL ELATE BUT HE DROOPED HIS HEAD UNDER THE HALF BRED TRADESMEN'S
PRAISE AND SHRANK CHAGRINED BEFORE THEIR CONGRATULATIONS
YORKE COULD NOT HELP ASKING HIM HOW HE LIKED HIS SUPPORTERS AND WHETHER
HE DID NOT THINK THEY DID HONOUR TO HIS CAUSE
BUT IT IS A PITY LAD
HE ADDED THAT YOU DID NOT HANG THESE FOUR SAMPLES OF THE UNWASHED
IF
YOU HAD MANAGED THAT FEAT THE GENTRY HERE WOULD HAVE RIVEN THE HORSES
OUT OF THE COACH YOKED TO A SCORE OF ASSES AND DRAWN YOU INTO STILBRO'
LIKE A CONQUERING GENERAL
MOORE SOON FORSOOK THE WINE BROKE FROM THE PARTY AND TOOK THE ROAD
IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES MR
YORKE FOLLOWED HIM
THEY RODE OUT OF
STILBRO' TOGETHER
IT WAS EARLY TO GO HOME BUT YET IT WAS LATE IN THE DAY
THE LAST RAY OF
THE SUN HAD ALREADY FADED FROM THE CLOUD EDGES AND THE OCTOBER NIGHT
WAS CASTING OVER THE MOORLANDS THE SHADOW OF HER APPROACH
MR
YORKE MODERATELY EXHILARATED WITH HIS MODERATE LIBATIONS AND NOT
DISPLEASED TO SEE YOUNG MOORE AGAIN IN YORKSHIRE AND TO HAVE HIM FOR
HIS COMRADE DURING THE LONG RIDE HOME TOOK THE DISCOURSE MUCH TO
HIMSELF
HE TOUCHED BRIEFLY BUT SCOFFINGLY ON THE TRIALS AND THE
CONVICTION HE PASSED THENCE TO THE GOSSIP OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND ERE
LONG HE ATTACKED MOORE ON HIS OWN PERSONAL CONCERNS
BOB I BELIEVE YOU ARE WORSTED AND YOU DESERVE IT
ALL WAS SMOOTH
FORTUNE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH YOU
SHE HAD DECREED YOU THE FIRST PRIZE
IN HER WHEEL TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS SHE ONLY REQUIRED THAT YOU SHOULD
HOLD YOUR HAND OUT AND TAKE IT
AND WHAT DID YOU DO YOU CALLED FOR A
HORSE AND RODE A HUNTING TO WARWICKSHIRE
YOUR SWEETHEART FORTUNE I
MEAN WAS PERFECTLY INDULGENT
SHE SAID 'I'LL EXCUSE HIM HE'S YOUNG
SHE WAITED LIKE 'PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT TILL THE CHASE WAS OVER AND
THE VERMIN PREY RUN DOWN
SHE EXPECTED YOU WOULD COME BACK THEN AND BE
A GOOD LAD
YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE HAD HER FIRST PRIZE
IT CAPPED HER BEYOND EXPRESSION AND ME TOO TO FIND THAT INSTEAD OF
THUNDERING HOME IN A BREAKNECK GALLOP AND LAYING YOUR ASSIZE LAURELS AT
HER FEET YOU COOLLY TOOK COACH UP TO LONDON
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE THERE
SATAN KNOWS NOTHING IN THIS WORLD I BELIEVE BUT SAT AND SULKED
YOUR
FACE WAS NEVER LILY FAIR BUT IT IS OLIVE GREEN NOW
YOU'RE NOT AS BONNY
AS YOU WERE MAN
AND WHO IS TO HAVE THIS PRIZE YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT
ONLY A BARONET THAT IS ALL
I HAVE NOT A DOUBT IN MY OWN MIND YOU'VE
LOST HER
SHE WILL BE LADY NUNNELY BEFORE CHRISTMAS
HEM QUITE PROBABLE
BUT SHE NEED NOT TO HAVE BEEN
FOOL OF A LAD I SWEAR YOU MIGHT HAVE
HAD HER
BY WHAT TOKEN MR
YORKE
BY EVERY TOKEN BY THE LIGHT OF HER EYES THE RED OF HER CHEEKS
RED
THEY GREW WHEN YOUR NAME WAS MENTIONED THOUGH OF CUSTOM THEY ARE PALE
MY CHANCE IS QUITE OVER I SUPPOSE
IT OUGHT TO BE
BUT TRY IT IS WORTH TRYING
I CALL THIS SIR PHILIP
MILK AND WATER
AND THEN HE WRITES VERSES THEY SAY TAGS RHYMES
YOU
ARE ABOVE THAT BOB AT ALL EVENTS
WOULD YOU ADVISE ME TO PROPOSE LATE AS IT IS MR
YORKE AT THE
ELEVENTH HOUR
YOU CAN BUT MAKE THE EXPERIMENT ROBERT
IF SHE HAS A FANCY FOR
YOU AND ON MY CONSCIENCE I BELIEVE SHE HAS OR HAD SHE WILL FORGIVE
MUCH
BUT MY LAD YOU ARE LAUGHING
IS IT AT ME YOU HAD BETTER GRIN AT
YOUR OWN PERVERSENESS
I SEE HOWEVER YOU LAUGH AT THE WRONG SIDE OF
YOUR MOUTH
YOU HAVE AS SOUR A LOOK AT THIS MOMENT AS ONE NEED WISH TO
SEE
I HAVE SO QUARRELLED WITH MYSELF YORKE
I HAVE SO KICKED AGAINST THE
PRICKS AND STRUGGLED IN A STRAIT WAISTCOAT AND DISLOCATED MY WRISTS
WITH WRENCHING THEM IN HANDCUFFS AND BATTERED MY HARD HEAD BY DRIVING
IT AGAINST A HARDER WALL
HA I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT
SHARP EXERCISE YON I HOPE IT HAS DONE YOU
GOOD TA'EN SOME OF THE SELF CONCEIT OUT OF YOU
SELF CONCEIT WHAT IS IT SELF RESPECT SELF TOLERANCE EVEN WHAT ARE
THEY DO YOU SELL THE ARTICLES DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO DOES GIVE AN
INDICATION
THEY WOULD FIND IN ME A LIBERAL CHAPMAN
I WOULD PART WITH
MY LAST GUINEA THIS MINUTE TO BUY
IS IT SO WITH YOU ROBERT I FIND THAT SPICY
I LIKE A MAN TO SPEAK HIS
MIND
WHAT HAS GONE WRONG
THE MACHINERY OF ALL MY NATURE THE WHOLE ENGINERY OF THIS HUMAN MILL
THE BOILER WHICH I TAKE TO BE THE HEART IS FIT TO BURST
THAT SULD BE PUTTEN I' PRINT IT'S STRIKING
IT'S ALMOST BLANK VERSE
YE'LL BE JINGLING INTO POETRY JUST E'NOW
IF THE AFFLATUS COMES GIVE
WAY ROBERT
NEVER HEED ME I'LL BEAR IT THIS WHET TIME
HIDEOUS ABHORRENT BASE BLUNDER YOU MAY COMMIT IN A MOMENT WHAT YOU
WILL RUE FOR YEARS WHAT LIFE CANNOT CANCEL
LAD GO ON
I CALL IT PIE NUTS SUGAR CANDY
I LIKE THE TASTE
UNCOMMONLY
GO ON
IT WILL DO YOU GOOD TO TALK
THE MOOR IS BEFORE US
NOW AND THERE IS NO LIFE FOR MANY A MILE ROUND
I WILL TALK
I AM NOT ASHAMED TO TELL
THERE IS A SORT OF WILD CAT IN
MY BREAST AND I CHOOSE THAT YOU SHALL HEAR HOW IT CAN YELL
TO ME IT IS MUSIC
WHAT GRAND VOICES YOU AND LOUIS HAVE WHEN LOUIS
SINGS TONES OFF LIKE A SOFT DEEP BELL I'VE FELT MYSELF TREMBLE AGAIN
THE NIGHT IS STILL
IT LISTENS
IT IS JUST LEANING DOWN TO YOU LIKE A
BLACK PRIEST TO A BLACKER PENITENT
CONFESS LAD
SMOOTH NAUGHT DOWN
BE
CANDID AS A CONVICTED JUSTIFIED SANCTIFIED METHODY AT AN EXPERIENCE
MEETING
MAKE YOURSELF AS WICKED AS BEELZEBUB
IT WILL EASE YOUR MIND
AS MEAN AS MAMMON YOU WOULD SAY
YORKE IF I GOT OFF HORSEBACK AND
LAID MYSELF DOWN ACROSS THE ROAD WOULD YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO GALLOP
OVER ME BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ABOUT TWENTY TIMES
WI' ALL THE PLEASURE IN LIFE IF THERE WERE NO SUCH THING AS A
CORONER'S INQUEST
HIRAM YORKE I CERTAINLY BELIEVED SHE LOVED ME
I HAVE SEEN HER EYES
SPARKLE RADIANTLY WHEN SHE HAS FOUND ME OUT IN A CROWD SHE HAS FLUSHED
UP CRIMSON WHEN SHE HAS OFFERED ME HER HAND AND SAID 'HOW DO YOU DO
MR
MOORE
MY NAME HAD A MAGICAL INFLUENCE OVER HER
WHEN OTHERS UTTERED IT SHE
CHANGED COUNTENANCE I KNOW SHE DID
SHE PRONOUNCED IT HERSELF IN THE
MOST MUSICAL OF HER MANY MUSICAL TONES
SHE WAS CORDIAL TO ME SHE TOOK
AN INTEREST IN ME SHE WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT ME SHE WISHED ME WELL SHE
SOUGHT SHE SEIZED EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT ME
I CONSIDERED
PAUSED WATCHED WEIGHED WONDERED
I COULD COME TO BUT ONE
CONCLUSION THIS IS LOVE
I LOOKED AT HER YORKE
I SAW IN HER YOUTH AND A SPECIES OF BEAUTY
I
SAW POWER IN HER
HER WEALTH OFFERED ME THE REDEMPTION OF MY HONOUR AND
MY STANDING
I OWED HER GRATITUDE
SHE HAD AIDED ME SUBSTANTIALLY AND
EFFECTUALLY BY A LOAN OF FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS
COULD I REMEMBER THESE
THINGS COULD I BELIEVE SHE LOVED ME COULD I HEAR WISDOM URGE ME TO
MARRY HER AND DISREGARD EVERY DEAR ADVANTAGE DISBELIEVE EVERY
FLATTERING SUGGESTION DISDAIN EVERY WELL WEIGHED COUNSEL TURN AND
LEAVE HER YOUNG GRACEFUL GRACIOUS MY BENEFACTRESS ATTACHED TO ME
ENAMOURED OF ME
I USED TO SAY SO TO MYSELF DWELL ON THE WORD MOUTH IT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN SWELL OVER IT WITH A PLEASANT POMPOUS COMPLACENCY
WITH AN ADMIRATION DEDICATED ENTIRELY TO MYSELF AND UNIMPAIRED EVEN BY
ESTEEM FOR HER INDEED I SMILED IN DEEP SECRECY AT HER NAVET AND
SIMPLICITY IN BEING THE FIRST TO LOVE AND TO SHOW IT
THAT WHIP OF
YOURS SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HEAVY HANDLE YORKE YOU CAN SWING IT ABOUT
YOUR HEAD AND KNOCK ME OUT OF THE SADDLE IF YOU CHOOSE
I SHOULD RATHER
RELISH A LOUNDERING WHACK
TAK PATIENCE ROBERT TILL THE MOON RISES AND I CAN SEE YOU
SPEAK
PLAIN OUT DID YOU LOVE HER OR NOT I COULD LIKE TO KNOW
I FEEL
CURIOUS
SIR SIR I SAY SHE IS VERY PRETTY IN HER OWN STYLE AND VERY
ATTRACTIVE
SHE HAS A LOOK AT TIMES OF A THING MADE OUT OF FIRE AND
AIR AT WHICH I STAND AND MARVEL WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF CLASPING AND
KISSING IT
I FELT IN HER A POWERFUL MAGNET TO MY INTEREST AND VANITY
I
NEVER FELT AS IF NATURE MEANT HER TO BE MY OTHER AND BETTER SELF
WHEN A
QUESTION ON THAT HEAD RUSHED UPON ME I FLUNG IT OFF SAYING BRUTALLY I
SHOULD BE RICH WITH HER AND RUINED WITHOUT HER VOWING I WOULD BE
PRACTICAL AND NOT ROMANTIC
A VERY SENSIBLE RESOLVE
WHAT MISCHIEF CAME OF IT BOB
WITH THIS SENSIBLE RESOLVE I WALKED UP TO FIELDHEAD ONE NIGHT LAST
AUGUST
IT WAS THE VERY EVE OF MY DEPARTURE FOR BIRMINGHAM FOR YOU
SEE I WANTED TO SECURE FORTUNE'S SPLENDID PRIZE
I HAD PREVIOUSLY
DISPATCHED A NOTE REQUESTING A PRIVATE INTERVIEW
I FOUND HER AT HOME
AND ALONE
SHE RECEIVED ME WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT FOR SHE THOUGHT I CAME ON
BUSINESS
I WAS EMBARRASSED ENOUGH BUT DETERMINED
I HARDLY KNOW HOW
I GOT THE OPERATION OVER BUT I WENT TO WORK IN A HARD FIRM
FASHION FRIGHTFUL ENOUGH I DARE SAY
I STERNLY OFFERED MYSELF MY FINE
PERSON WITH MY DEBTS OF COURSE AS A SETTLEMENT
IT VEXED ME IT KINDLED MY IRE TO FIND THAT SHE NEITHER BLUSHED
TREMBLED NOR LOOKED DOWN
SHE RESPONDED 'I DOUBT WHETHER I HAVE
UNDERSTOOD YOU MR
MOORE
AND I HAD TO GO OVER THE WHOLE PROPOSAL TWICE AND WORD IT AS PLAINLY
AS A B C BEFORE SHE WOULD FULLY TAKE IT IN
AND THEN WHAT DID SHE DO
INSTEAD OF FALTERING A SWEET YES OR MAINTAINING A SOFT CONFUSED
SILENCE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AS GOOD SHE STARTED UP WALKED TWICE
FAST THROUGH THE ROOM IN THE WAY THAT SHE ONLY DOES AND NO OTHER
WOMAN AND EJACULATED 'GOD BLESS ME
YORKE I STOOD ON THE HEARTH BACKED BY THE MANTELPIECE AGAINST IT I
LEANED AND PREPARED FOR ANYTHING EVERYTHING
I KNEW MY DOOM AND I
KNEW MYSELF
THERE WAS NO MISUNDERSTANDING HER ASPECT AND VOICE
SHE
STOPPED AND LOOKED AT ME
'GOD BLESS ME SHE PITEOUSLY REPEATED IN THAT SHOCKED INDIGNANT YET
SADDENED ACCENT
'YOU HAVE MADE A STRANGE PROPOSAL STRANGE FROM YOU
AND IF YOU KNEW HOW STRANGELY YOU WORDED IT AND LOOKED IT YOU WOULD BE
STARTLED AT YOURSELF
YOU SPOKE LIKE A BRIGAND WHO DEMANDED MY PURSE
RATHER THAN LIKE A LOVER WHO ASKED MY HEART
A QUEER SENTENCE WAS IT NOT YORKE AND I KNEW AS SHE UTTERED IT IT
WAS TRUE AS QUEER
HER WORDS WERE A MIRROR IN WHICH I SAW MYSELF
I LOOKED AT HER DUMB AND WOLFISH
SHE AT ONCE ENRAGED AND SHAMED ME
'GRARD MOORE YOU KNOW YOU DON'T LOVE SHIRLEY KEELDAR I MIGHT HAVE
BROKEN OUT INTO FALSE SWEARING VOWED THAT I DID LOVE HER BUT I COULD
NOT LIE IN HER PURE FACE
I COULD NOT PERJURE MYSELF IN HER TRUTHFUL
PRESENCE
BESIDES SUCH HOLLOW OATHS WOULD HAVE BEEN VAIN AS VOID
SHE
WOULD NO MORE HAVE BELIEVED ME THAN SHE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THE GHOST OF
JUDAS HAD HE BROKEN FROM THE NIGHT AND STOOD BEFORE HER
HER FEMALE
HEART HAD FINER PERCEPTIONS THAN TO BE CHEATED INTO MISTAKING MY
HALF COARSE HALF COLD ADMIRATION FOR TRUE THROBBING MANLY LOVE
WHAT NEXT HAPPENED YOU WILL SAY MR
YORKE
WHY SHE SAT DOWN IN THE WINDOW SEAT AND CRIED
SHE CRIED PASSIONATELY
HER EYES NOT ONLY RAINED BUT LIGHTENED
THEY FLASHED OPEN LARGE DARK
HAUGHTY UPON ME
THEY SAID 'YOU HAVE PAINED ME YOU HAVE OUTRAGED ME
YOU HAVE DECEIVED ME
SHE ADDED WORDS SOON TO LOOKS
'I DID RESPECT I DID ADMIRE I DID LIKE YOU SHE SAID 'YES AS
MUCH AS IF YOU WERE MY BROTHER AND YOU YOU WANT TO MAKE A
SPECULATION OF ME
YOU WOULD IMMOLATE ME TO THAT MILL YOUR MOLOCH
I HAD THE COMMON SENSE TO ABSTAIN FROM ANY WORD OF EXCUSE ANY ATTEMPT
AT PALLIATION
I STOOD TO BE SCORNED
SOLD TO THE DEVIL FOR THE TIME BEING I WAS CERTAINLY INFATUATED
WHEN
I DID SPEAK WHAT DO YOU THINK I SAID
'WHATEVER MY OWN FEELINGS WERE I WAS PERSUADED YOU LOVED ME MISS
KEELDAR
BEAUTIFUL WAS IT NOT SHE SAT QUITE CONFOUNDED
'IS IT ROBERT MOORE
THAT SPEAKS I HEARD HER MUTTER
'IS IT A MAN OR SOMETHING LOWER
'DO YOU MEAN SHE ASKED ALOUD 'DO YOU MEAN YOU THOUGHT I LOVED YOU AS
WE LOVE THOSE WE WISH TO MARRY
IT WAS MY MEANING AND I SAID SO
'YOU CONCEIVED AN IDEA OBNOXIOUS TO A WOMAN'S FEELINGS WAS HER
ANSWER
'YOU HAVE ANNOUNCED IT IN A FASHION REVOLTING TO A WOMAN'S SOUL
YOU INSINUATE THAT ALL THE FRANK KINDNESS I HAVE SHOWN YOU HAS BEEN A
COMPLICATED A BOLD AND AN IMMODEST MANUVRE TO ENSNARE A HUSBAND
YOU
IMPLY THAT AT LAST YOU COME HERE OUT OF PITY TO OFFER ME YOUR HAND
BECAUSE I HAVE COURTED YOU
LET ME SAY THIS YOUR SIGHT IS JAUNDICED
YOU HAVE SEEN WRONG
YOUR MIND IS WARPED YOU HAVE JUDGED WRONG
YOUR
TONGUE BETRAYS YOU YOU NOW SPEAK WRONG
I NEVER LOVED YOU
BE AT REST
THERE
MY HEART IS AS PURE OF PASSION FOR YOU AS YOURS IS BARREN OF
AFFECTION FOR ME
I HOPE I WAS ANSWERED YORKE
'I SEEM TO BE A BLIND BESOTTED SORT OF PERSON WAS MY REMARK
LOVED YOU SHE CRIED
'WHY I HAVE BEEN AS FRANK WITH YOU AS A
SISTER NEVER SHUNNED YOU NEVER FEARED YOU
YOU CANNOT SHE AFFIRMED
TRIUMPHANTLY 'YOU CANNOT MAKE ME TREMBLE WITH YOUR COMING NOR
ACCELERATE MY PULSE BY YOUR INFLUENCE
I ALLEGED THAT OFTEN WHEN SHE SPOKE TO ME SHE BLUSHED AND THAT THE
SOUND OF MY NAME MOVED HER
'NOT FOR YOUR SAKE SHE DECLARED BRIEFLY
I URGED EXPLANATION BUT
COULD GET NONE
'WHEN I SAT BESIDE YOU AT THE SCHOOL FEAST DID YOU THINK I LOVED YOU
THEN WHEN I STOPPED YOU IN MAYTHORN LANE DID YOU THINK I LOVED YOU
THEN WHEN I CALLED ON YOU IN THE COUNTING HOUSE WHEN I WALKED WITH YOU
ON THE PAVEMENT DID YOU THINK I LOVED YOU THEN
SO SHE QUESTIONED ME AND I SAID I DID
BY THE LORD YORKE SHE ROSE SHE GREW TALL SHE EXPANDED AND REFINED
ALMOST TO FLAME
THERE WAS A TREMBLING ALL THROUGH HER AS IN LIVE COAL
WHEN ITS VIVID VERMILION IS HOTTEST
'THAT IS TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE THE WORST OPINION OF ME THAT YOU DENY ME
THE POSSESSION OF ALL I VALUE MOST
THAT IS TO SAY THAT I AM A TRAITOR
TO ALL MY SISTERS THAT I HAVE ACTED AS NO WOMAN CAN ACT WITHOUT
DEGRADING HERSELF AND HER SEX THAT I HAVE SOUGHT WHERE THE INCORRUPT OF
MY KIND NATURALLY SCORN AND ABHOR TO SEEK SHE AND I WERE SILENT FOR
MANY A MINUTE
'LUCIFER STAR OF THE MORNING SHE WENT ON 'THOU ART
FALLEN YOU ONCE HIGH IN MY ESTEEM ARE HURLED DOWN YOU ONCE INTIMATE
IN MY FRIENDSHIP ARE CAST OUT
GO
I WENT NOT
I HAD HEARD HER VOICE TREMBLE SEEN HER LIP QUIVER
I KNEW
ANOTHER STORM OF TEARS WOULD FALL AND THEN I BELIEVED SOME CALM AND
SOME SUNSHINE MUST COME AND I WOULD WAIT FOR IT
AS FAST BUT MORE QUIETLY THAN BEFORE THE WARM RAIN STREAMED DOWN
THERE WAS ANOTHER SOUND IN HER WEEPING A SOFTER MORE REGRETFUL SOUND
WHILE I WATCHED HER EYES LIFTED TO ME A GAZE MORE REPROACHFUL THAN
HAUGHTY MORE MOURNFUL THAN INCENSED
'O MOORE SAID SHE
IT WAS WORSE THAN 'ET TU BRUTE
I RELIEVED MYSELF BY WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SIGH BUT IT BECAME A
GROAN
A SENSE OF CAIN LIKE DESOLATION MADE MY BREAST ACHE
'THERE HAS BEEN ERROR IN WHAT I HAVE DONE I SAID 'AND IT HAS WON ME
BITTER WAGES WHICH I WILL GO AND SPEND FAR FROM HER WHO GAVE THEM
I TOOK MY HAT
ALL THE TIME I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE TO DEPART SO AND I
BELIEVED SHE WOULD NOT LET ME
NOR WOULD SHE BUT FOR THE MORTAL PANG I
HAD GIVEN HER PRIDE THAT COWED HER COMPASSION AND KEPT HER SILENT
I WAS OBLIGED TO TURN BACK OF MY OWN ACCORD WHEN I REACHED THE DOOR TO
APPROACH HER AND TO SAY 'FORGIVE ME
'I COULD IF THERE WAS NOT MYSELF TO FORGIVE TOO WAS HER REPLY 'BUT
TO MISLEAD A SAGACIOUS MAN SO FAR I MUST HAVE DONE WRONG
I BROKE OUT SUDDENLY WITH SOME DECLAMATION I DO NOT REMEMBER
I KNOW
THAT IT WAS SINCERE AND THAT MY WISH AND AIM WERE TO ABSOLVE HER TO
HERSELF
IN FACT IN HER CASE SELF ACCUSATION WAS A CHIMERA
AT LAST SHE EXTENDED HER HAND
FOR THE FIRST TIME I WISHED TO TAKE HER
IN MY ARMS AND KISS HER
I DID KISS HER HAND MANY TIMES
'SOME DAY WE SHALL BE FRIENDS AGAIN SHE SAID 'WHEN YOU HAVE HAD TIME
TO READ MY ACTIONS AND MOTIVES IN A TRUE LIGHT AND NOT SO HORRIBLY TO
MISINTERPRET THEM
TIME MAY GIVE YOU THE RIGHT KEY TO ALL
THEN
PERHAPS YOU WILL COMPREHEND ME AND THEN WE SHALL BE RECONCILED
FAREWELL DROPS ROLLED SLOW DOWN HER CHEEKS
SHE WIPED THEM AWAY
'I AM SORRY FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED DEEPLY SORRY SHE SOBBED
SO WAS I
GOD KNOWS THUS WERE WE SEVERED
A QUEER TALE COMMENTED MR
YORKE
I'LL DO IT NO MORE VOWED HIS COMPANION NEVER MORE WILL I MENTION
MARRIAGE TO A WOMAN UNLESS I FEEL LOVE
HENCEFORTH CREDIT AND COMMERCE
MAY TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
BANKRUPTCY MAY COME WHEN IT LISTS
I HAVE
DONE WITH SLAVISH FEAR OF DISASTER
I MEAN TO WORK DILIGENTLY WAIT
PATIENTLY BEAR STEADILY
LET THE WORST COME I WILL TAKE MY AXE AND AN
EMIGRANT'S BERTH AND GO OUT WITH LOUIS TO THE WEST HE AND I HAVE
SETTLED IT
NO WOMAN SHALL EVER AGAIN LOOK AT ME AS MISS KEELDAR LOOKED
EVER AGAIN FEEL TOWARDS ME AS MISS KEELDAR FELT
IN NO WOMAN'S PRESENCE
WILL I EVER AGAIN STAND AT ONCE SUCH A FOOL AND SUCH A KNAVE SUCH A
BRUTE AND SUCH A PUPPY
TUT SAID THE IMPERTURBABLE YORKE YOU MAKE TOO MUCH OF IT BUT
STILL I SAY I AM CAPPED
FIRSTLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE YOU AND
SECONDLY THAT YOU DID NOT LOVE HER
YOU ARE BOTH YOUNG YOU ARE BOTH
HANDSOME YOU ARE BOTH WELL ENOUGH FOR WIT AND EVEN FOR TEMPER TAKE YOU
ON THE RIGHT SIDE
WHAT AILED YOU THAT YOU COULD NOT AGREE
WE NEVER HAVE BEEN NEVER COULD BE AT HOME WITH EACH OTHER
YORKE
ADMIRE EACH OTHER AS WE MIGHT AT A DISTANCE STILL WE JARRED WHEN
WE CAME VERY NEAR
I HAVE SAT AT ONE SIDE OF A ROOM AND OBSERVED HER AT
THE OTHER PERHAPS IN AN EXCITED GENIAL MOMENT WHEN SHE HAD SOME OF
HER FAVOURITES ROUND HER HER OLD BEAUX FOR INSTANCE YOURSELF AND
HELSTONE WITH WHOM SHE IS SO PLAYFUL PLEASANT AND ELOQUENT
I HAVE
WATCHED HER WHEN SHE WAS MOST NATURAL MOST LIVELY AND MOST LOVELY MY
JUDGMENT HAS PRONOUNCED HER BEAUTIFUL
BEAUTIFUL SHE IS AT TIMES WHEN
HER MOOD AND HER ARRAY PARTAKE OF THE SPLENDID
I HAVE DRAWN A LITTLE
NEARER FEELING THAT OUR TERMS OF ACQUAINTANCE GAVE ME THE RIGHT OF
APPROACH
I HAVE JOINED THE CIRCLE ROUND HER SEAT CAUGHT HER EYE AND
MASTERED HER ATTENTION THEN WE HAVE CONVERSED AND OTHERS THINKING ME
PERHAPS PECULIARLY PRIVILEGED HAVE WITHDRAWN BY DEGREES AND LEFT US
ALONE
WERE WE HAPPY THUS LEFT FOR MYSELF I MUST SAY NO
ALWAYS A
FEELING OF CONSTRAINT CAME OVER ME ALWAYS I WAS DISPOSED TO BE STERN
AND STRANGE
WE TALKED POLITICS AND BUSINESS
NO SOFT SENSE OF DOMESTIC
INTIMACY EVER OPENED OUR HEARTS OR THAWED OUR LANGUAGE AND MADE IT FLOW
EASY AND LIMPID
IF WE HAD CONFIDENCES THEY WERE CONFIDENCES OF THE
COUNTING HOUSE NOT OF THE HEART
NOTHING IN HER CHERISHED AFFECTION IN
ME MADE ME BETTER GENTLER SHE ONLY STIRRED MY BRAIN AND WHETTED MY
ACUTENESS
SHE NEVER CREPT INTO MY HEART OR INFLUENCED ITS PULSE AND
FOR THIS GOOD REASON NO DOUBT BECAUSE I HAD NOT THE SECRET OF MAKING
HER LOVE ME
WELL LAD IT IS A QUEER THING
I MIGHT LAUGH AT THEE AND RECKON TO
DESPISE THY REFINEMENTS BUT AS IT IS DARK NIGHT AND WE ARE BY
OURSELVES I DON'T MIND TELLING THEE THAT THY TALK BRINGS BACK A GLIMPSE
OF MY OWN PAST LIFE
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO I TRIED TO PERSUADE A
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN TO LOVE ME AND SHE WOULD NOT
I HAD NOT THE KEY TO HER
NATURE SHE WAS A STONE WALL TO ME DOORLESS AND WINDOWLESS
BUT YOU LOVED HER YORKE YOU WORSHIPPED MARY CAVE
YOUR CONDUCT
AFTER ALL WAS THAT OF A MAN NEVER OF A FORTUNE HUNTER
AY I DID LOVE HER BUT THEN SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AS THE MOON WE DO
NOT SEE TO NIGHT
THERE IS NAUGHT LIKE HER IN THESE DAYS
MISS
HELSTONE MAYBE HAS A LOOK OF HER BUT NOBODY ELSE
WHO HAS A LOOK OF HER
THAT BLACK COATED TYRANT'S NIECE THAT QUIET DELICATE MISS HELSTONE
MANY A TIME I HAVE PUT ON MY SPECTACLES TO LOOK AT THE LASSIE IN CHURCH
BECAUSE SHE HAS GENTLE BLUE EEN WI' LONG LASHES AND WHEN SHE SITS IN
SHADOW AND IS VERY STILL AND VERY PALE AND IS HAPPEN ABOUT TO FALL
ASLEEP WI' THE LENGTH OF THE SERMON AND THE HEAT OF THE BIGGIN' SHE IS
AS LIKE ONE OF CANOVA'S MARBLES AS AUGHT ELSE
WAS MARY CAVE IN THAT STYLE
FAR GRANDER LESS LASS LIKE AND FLESH LIKE
YOU WONDERED WHY SHE
HADN'T WINGS AND A CROWN
SHE WAS A STATELY PEACEFUL ANGEL WAS MY
MARY
AND YOU COULD NOT PERSUADE HER TO LOVE YOU
NOT WITH ALL I COULD DO THOUGH I PRAYED HEAVEN MANY A TIME ON MY
BENDED KNEES TO HELP ME
MARY CAVE WAS NOT WHAT YOU THINK HER YORKE
I HAVE SEEN HER PICTURE AT
THE RECTORY
SHE IS NO ANGEL BUT A FAIR REGULAR FEATURED
TACITURN LOOKING WOMAN RATHER TOO WHITE AND LIFELESS FOR MY TASTE
BUT
SUPPOSING SHE HAD BEEN SOMETHING BETTER THAN SHE WAS
ROBERT INTERRUPTED YORKE I COULD FELL YOU OFF YOUR HORSE AT THIS
MOMENT
HOWEVER I'LL HOLD MY HAND
REASON TELLS ME YOU ARE RIGHT AND I
AM WRONG
I KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE PASSION I STILL HAVE IS ONLY THE
REMNANT OF AN ILLUSION
IF MISS CAVE HAD POSSESSED EITHER FEELING OR
SENSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO PERFECTLY IMPASSIBLE TO MY REGARD AS
SHE SHOWED HERSELF SHE MUST HAVE PREFERRED ME TO THAT COPPER FACED
DESPOT
SUPPOSING YORKE SHE HAD BEEN EDUCATED NO WOMEN WERE EDUCATED IN
THOSE DAYS SUPPOSING SHE HAD POSSESSED A THOUGHTFUL ORIGINAL MIND A
LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE A WISH FOR INFORMATION WHICH SHE TOOK AN ARTLESS
DELIGHT IN RECEIVING FROM YOUR LIPS AND HAVING MEASURED OUT TO HER BY
YOUR HAND SUPPOSING HER CONVERSATION WHEN SHE SAT AT YOUR SIDE WAS
FERTILE VARIED IMBUED WITH A PICTURESQUE GRACE AND GENIAL INTEREST
QUIET FLOWING BUT CLEAR AND BOUNTEOUS SUPPOSING THAT WHEN YOU STOOD
NEAR HER BY CHANCE OR WHEN YOU SAT NEAR HER BY DESIGN COMFORT AT ONCE
BECAME YOUR ATMOSPHERE AND CONTENT YOUR ELEMENT SUPPOSING THAT
WHENEVER HER FACE WAS UNDER YOUR GAZE OR HER IDEA FILLED YOUR THOUGHTS
YOU GRADUALLY CEASED TO BE HARD AND ANXIOUS AND PURE AFFECTION LOVE OF
HOME THIRST FOR SWEET DISCOURSE UNSELFISH LONGING TO PROTECT AND
CHERISH REPLACED THE SORDID CANKERING CALCULATIONS OF YOUR TRADE
SUPPOSING WITH ALL THIS THAT MANY A TIME WHEN YOU HAD BEEN SO HAPPY
AS TO POSSESS YOUR MARY'S LITTLE HAND YOU HAD FELT IT TREMBLE AS YOU
HELD IT JUST AS A WARM LITTLE BIRD TREMBLES WHEN YOU TAKE IT FROM ITS
NEST SUPPOSING YOU HAD NOTICED HER SHRINK INTO THE BACKGROUND ON YOUR
ENTRANCE INTO A ROOM YET IF YOU SOUGHT HER IN HER RETREAT SHE WELCOMED
YOU WITH THE SWEETEST SMILE THAT EVER LIT A FAIR VIRGIN FACE AND ONLY
TURNED HER EYES FROM THE ENCOUNTER OF YOUR OWN LEST THEIR CLEARNESS
SHOULD REVEAL TOO MUCH SUPPOSING IN SHORT YOUR MARY HAD BEEN NOT
COLD BUT MODEST NOT VACANT BUT REFLECTIVE NOT OBTUSE BUT SENSITIVE
NOT INANE BUT INNOCENT NOT PRUDISH BUT PURE WOULD YOU HAVE LEFT HER
TO COURT ANOTHER WOMAN FOR HER WEALTH
MR
YORKE RAISED HIS HAT WIPED HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF
THE MOON IS UP WAS HIS FIRST NOT QUITE RELEVANT REMARK POINTING WITH
HIS WHIP ACROSS THE MOOR
THERE SHE IS RISING INTO THE HAZE STARING
AT US WI' A STRANGE RED GLOWER
SHE IS NO MORE SILVER THAN OLD
HELSTONE'S BROW IS IVORY
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN BY LEANING HER CHEEK ON
RUSHEDGE I' THAT WAY AND LOOKING AT US WI' A SCOWL AND A MENACE
YORKE IF MARY HAD LOVED YOU SILENTLY YET FAITHFULLY CHASTELY YET
FERVENTLY AS YOU WOULD WISH YOUR WIFE TO LOVE WOULD YOU HAVE LEFT
HER
ROBERT HE LIFTED HIS ARM HE HELD IT SUSPENDED AND PAUSED ROBERT
THIS IS A QUEER WORLD AND MEN ARE MADE OF THE QUEEREST DREGS THAT
CHAOS CHURNED UP IN HER FERMENT
I MIGHT SWEAR SOUNDING OATHS OATHS
THAT WOULD MAKE THE POACHERS THINK THERE WAS A BITTERN BOOMING IN
BILBERRY MOSS THAT IN THE CASE YOU PUT DEATH ONLY SHOULD HAVE PARTED
ME FROM MARY
BUT I HAVE LIVED IN THE WORLD FIFTY FIVE YEARS I HAVE
BEEN FORCED TO STUDY HUMAN NATURE AND TO SPEAK A DARK TRUTH THE ODDS
ARE IF MARY HAD LOVED AND NOT SCORNED ME IF I HAD BEEN SECURE OF HER
AFFECTION CERTAIN OF HER CONSTANCY BEEN IRRITATED BY NO DOUBTS STUNG
BY NO HUMILIATIONS THE ODDS ARE HE LET HIS HAND FALL HEAVY ON THE
SADDLE THE ODDS ARE I SHOULD HAVE LEFT HER
THEY RODE SIDE BY SIDE IN SILENCE
ERE EITHER SPOKE AGAIN THEY WERE ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF RUSHEDGE
BRIARFIELD LIGHTS STARRED THE PURPLE SKIRT
OF THE MOOR
ROBERT BEING THE YOUNGEST AND HAVING LESS OF THE PAST TO
ABSORB HIM THAN HIS COMRADE RECOMMENCED FIRST
I BELIEVE I DAILY FIND IT PROVED THAT WE CAN GET NOTHING IN THIS
WORLD WORTH KEEPING NOT SO MUCH AS A PRINCIPLE OR A CONVICTION EXCEPT
OUT OF PURIFYING FLAME OR THROUGH STRENGTHENING PERIL
WE ERR WE FALL
WE ARE HUMBLED THEN WE WALK MORE CAREFULLY
WE GREEDILY EAT AND DRINK
POISON OUT OF THE GILDED CUP OF VICE OR FROM THE BEGGAR'S WALLET OF
AVARICE
WE ARE SICKENED DEGRADED EVERYTHING GOOD IN US REBELS AGAINST
US OUR SOULS RISE BITTERLY INDIGNANT AGAINST OUR BODIES THERE IS A
PERIOD OF CIVIL WAR IF THE SOUL HAS STRENGTH IT CONQUERS AND RULES
THEREAFTER
WHAT ART THOU GOING TO DO NOW ROBERT WHAT ARE THY PLANS
FOR MY PRIVATE PLANS I'LL KEEP THEM TO MYSELF WHICH IS VERY EASY AS
AT PRESENT I HAVE NONE
NO PRIVATE LIFE IS PERMITTED A MAN IN MY
POSITION A MAN IN DEBT
FOR MY PUBLIC PLANS MY VIEWS ARE A LITTLE
ALTERED
WHILE I WAS IN BIRMINGHAM I LOOKED A LITTLE INTO REALITY
CONSIDERED CLOSELY AND AT THEIR SOURCE THE CAUSES OF THE PRESENT
TROUBLES OF THIS COUNTRY
I DID THE SAME IN LONDON
UNKNOWN I COULD GO
WHERE I PLEASED MIX WITH WHOM I WOULD
I WENT WHERE THERE WAS WANT OF
FOOD OF FUEL OF CLOTHING WHERE THERE WAS NO OCCUPATION AND NO HOPE
I
SAW SOME WITH NATURALLY ELEVATED TENDENCIES AND GOOD FEELINGS KEPT
DOWN AMONGST SORDID PRIVATIONS AND HARASSING GRIEFS
I SAW MANY
ORIGINALLY LOW AND TO WHOM LACK OF EDUCATION LEFT SCARCELY ANYTHING BUT
ANIMAL WANTS DISAPPOINTED IN THOSE WANTS AHUNGERED ATHIRST AND
DESPERATE AS FAMISHED ANIMALS
I SAW WHAT TAUGHT MY BRAIN A NEW LESSON
AND FILLED MY BREAST WITH FRESH FEELINGS
I HAVE NO INTENTION TO PROFESS
MORE SOFTNESS OR SENTIMENT THAN I HAVE HITHERTO PROFESSED MUTINY AND
AMBITION I REGARD AS I HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED THEM
I SHOULD RESIST A
RIOTOUS MOB JUST AS HERETOFORE I SHOULD OPEN ON THE SCENT OF A RUNAWAY
RINGLEADER AS EAGERLY AS EVER AND RUN HIM DOWN AS RELENTLESSLY AND
FOLLOW HIM UP TO CONDIGN PUNISHMENT AS RIGOROUSLY BUT I SHOULD DO IT
NOW CHIEFLY FOR THE SAKE AND THE SECURITY OF THOSE HE MISLED
SOMETHING
THERE IS TO LOOK TO YORKE BEYOND A MAN'S PERSONAL INTEREST BEYOND THE
ADVANCEMENT OF WELL LAID SCHEMES BEYOND EVEN THE DISCHARGE OF
DISHONOURING DEBTS
TO RESPECT HIMSELF A MAN MUST BELIEVE HE RENDERS
JUSTICE TO HIS FELLOW MEN
UNLESS I AM MORE CONSIDERATE TO IGNORANCE
MORE FORBEARING TO SUFFERING THAN I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN I SHALL SCORN
MYSELF AS GROSSLY UNJUST WHAT NOW HE SAID ADDRESSING HIS HORSE
WHICH HEARING THE RIPPLE OF WATER AND FEELING THIRSTY TURNED TO A
WAYSIDE TROUGH WHERE THE MOONBEAM WAS PLAYING IN A CRYSTAL EDDY
YORKE PURSUED MOORE RIDE ON I MUST LET HIM DRINK
YORKE ACCORDINGLY RODE SLOWLY FORWARDS OCCUPYING HIMSELF AS HE ADVANCED
IN DISCRIMINATING AMONGST THE MANY LIGHTS NOW SPANGLING THE DISTANCE
THOSE OF BRIARMAINS
STILBRO' MOOR WAS LEFT BEHIND PLANTATIONS ROSE
DUSK ON EITHER HAND THEY WERE DESCENDING THE HILL BELOW THEM LAY THE
VALLEY WITH ITS POPULOUS PARISH THEY FELT ALREADY AT HOME
SURROUNDED NO LONGER BY HEATH IT WAS NOT STARTLING TO MR
YORKE TO SEE
A HAT RISE AND TO HEAR A VOICE SPEAK BEHIND THE WALL
THE WORDS
HOWEVER WERE PECULIAR
WHEN THE WICKED PERISHETH THERE IS SHOUTING IT SAID AND ADDED AS
THE WHIRLWIND PASSETH SO IS THE WICKED NO MORE WITH A DEEPER GROWL
TERRORS TAKE HOLD OF HIM AS WATERS HELL IS NAKED BEFORE HIM
HE SHALL
DIE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE
A FIERCE FLASH AND SHARP CRACK VIOLATED THE CALM OF NIGHT
YORKE ERE HE
TURNED KNEW THE FOUR CONVICTS OF BIRMINGHAM WERE AVENGED
CHAPTER XXXI
UNCLE AND NIECE
THE DIE WAS CAST
SIR PHILIP NUNNELY KNEW IT SHIRLEY KNEW IT MR
SYMPSON KNEW IT
THAT EVENING WHEN ALL THE FIELDHEAD FAMILY DINED AT
NUNNELY PRIORY DECIDED THE BUSINESS
TWO OR THREE THINGS CONDUCED TO BRING THE BARONET TO A POINT
HE HAD
OBSERVED THAT MISS KEELDAR LOOKED PENSIVE AND DELICATE
THIS NEW PHASE
IN HER DEMEANOUR SMOTE HIM ON HIS WEAK OR POETIC SIDE
A SPONTANEOUS
SONNET BREWED IN HIS BRAIN AND WHILE IT WAS STILL WORKING THERE ONE OF
HIS SISTERS PERSUADED HIS LADY LOVE TO SIT DOWN TO THE PIANO AND SING A
BALLAD ONE OF SIR PHILIP'S OWN BALLADS
IT WAS THE LEAST ELABORATE THE
LEAST AFFECTED OUT OF ALL COMPARISON THE BEST OF HIS NUMEROUS EFFORTS
IT CHANCED THAT SHIRLEY THE MOMENT BEFORE HAD BEEN GAZING FROM A
WINDOW DOWN ON THE PARK
SHE HAD SEEN THAT STORMY MOONLIGHT WHICH LE
PROFESSEUR LOUIS WAS PERHAPS AT THE SAME INSTANT CONTEMPLATING FROM HER
OWN OAK PARLOUR LATTICE SHE HAD SEEN THE ISOLATED TREES OF THE
DOMAIN BROAD STRONG SPREADING OAKS AND HIGH TOWERING HEROIC
BEECHES WRESTLING WITH THE GALE
HER EAR HAD CAUGHT THE FULL ROAR OF
THE FOREST LOWER DOWN THE SWIFT RUSHING OF CLOUDS THE MOON TO THE
EYE HASTING SWIFTER STILL HAD CROSSED HER VISION
SHE TURNED FROM
SIGHT AND SOUND TOUCHED IF NOT RAPT WAKENED IF NOT INSPIRED
SHE SANG AS REQUESTED
THERE WAS MUCH ABOUT LOVE IN THE
BALLAD FAITHFUL LOVE THAT REFUSED TO ABANDON ITS OBJECT LOVE THAT
DISASTER COULD NOT SHAKE LOVE THAT IN CALAMITY WAXED FONDER IN POVERTY
CLUNG CLOSER
THE WORDS WERE SET TO A FINE OLD AIR IN THEMSELVES THEY
WERE SIMPLE AND SWEET
PERHAPS WHEN READ THEY WANTED FORCE WHEN
WELL SUNG THEY WANTED NOTHING
SHIRLEY SANG THEM WELL
SHE BREATHED
INTO THE FEELING SOFTNESS SHE POURED ROUND THE PASSION FORCE
HER VOICE
WAS FINE THAT EVENING ITS EXPRESSION DRAMATIC
SHE IMPRESSED ALL AND
CHARMED ONE
ON LEAVING THE INSTRUMENT SHE WENT TO THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A
SEAT SEMI STOOL SEMI CUSHION
THE LADIES WERE ROUND HER NONE OF THEM
SPOKE
THE MISSES SYMPSON AND THE MISSES NUNNELY LOOKED UPON HER AS
QUIET POULTRY MIGHT LOOK ON AN EGRET AN IBIS OR ANY OTHER STRANGE
FOWL
WHAT MADE HER SING SO THEY NEVER SANG SO
WAS IT PROPER TO
SING WITH SUCH EXPRESSION WITH SUCH ORIGINALITY SO UNLIKE A
SCHOOL GIRL DECIDEDLY NOT
IT WAS STRANGE IT WAS UNUSUAL
WHAT WAS
STRANGE MUST BE WRONG WHAT WAS UNUSUAL MUST BE IMPROPER
SHIRLEY WAS JUDGED
MOREOVER OLD LADY NUNNELY EYED HER STONILY FROM HER GREAT CHAIR BY THE
FIRESIDE
HER GAZE SAID THIS WOMAN IS NOT OF MINE OR MY DAUGHTERS'
KIND
I OBJECT TO HER AS MY SON'S WIFE
HER SON CATCHING THE LOOK READ ITS MEANING
HE GREW ALARMED
WHAT HE
SO WISHED TO WIN THERE WAS DANGER HE MIGHT LOSE
HE MUST MAKE HASTE
THE ROOM THEY WERE IN HAD ONCE BEEN A PICTURE GALLERY
SIR PHILIP'S
FATHER SIR MONCKTON HAD CONVERTED IT INTO A SALOON BUT STILL IT HAD A
SHADOWY LONG WITHDRAWING LOOK
A DEEP RECESS WITH A WINDOW A RECESS
THAT HELD ONE COUCH ONE TABLE AND A FAIRY CABINET FORMED A ROOM
WITHIN A ROOM
TWO PERSONS STANDING THERE MIGHT INTERCHANGE A DIALOGUE
AND SO IT WERE NEITHER LONG NOR LOUD NONE BE THE WISER
SIR PHILIP INDUCED TWO OF HIS SISTERS TO PERPETRATE A DUET
HE GAVE
OCCUPATION TO THE MISSES SYMPSON
THE ELDER LADIES WERE CONVERSING
TOGETHER
HE WAS PLEASED TO REMARK THAT MEANTIME SHIRLEY ROSE TO LOOK AT
THE PICTURES
HE HAD A TALE TO TELL ABOUT ONE ANCESTRESS WHOSE DARK
BEAUTY SEEMED AS THAT OF A FLOWER OF THE SOUTH
HE JOINED HER AND BEGAN
TO TELL IT
THERE WERE MEMENTOES OF THE SAME LADY IN THE CABINET ADORNING THE
RECESS AND WHILE SHIRLEY WAS STOOPING TO EXAMINE THE MISSAL AND THE
ROSARY ON THE INLAID SHELF AND WHILE THE MISSES NUNNELY INDULGED IN A
PROLONGED SCREECH GUILTLESS OF EXPRESSION PURE OF ORIGINALITY
PERFECTLY CONVENTIONAL AND ABSOLUTELY UNMEANING SIR PHILIP STOOPED TOO
AND WHISPERED A FEW HURRIED SENTENCES
AT FIRST MISS KEELDAR WAS STRUCK
SO STILL YOU MIGHT HAVE FANCIED THAT WHISPER A CHARM WHICH HAD CHANGED
HER TO A STATUE BUT SHE PRESENTLY LOOKED UP AND ANSWERED
THEY PARTED
MISS KEELDAR RETURNED TO THE FIRE AND RESUMED HER SEAT
THE BARONET
GAZED AFTER HER THEN WENT AND STOOD BEHIND HIS SISTERS
MR
SYMPSON MR
SYMPSON ONLY HAD MARKED THE PANTOMIME
THAT GENTLEMAN DREW HIS OWN CONCLUSIONS
HAD HE BEEN AS ACUTE AS HE WAS
MEDDLING AS PROFOUND AS HE WAS PRYING HE MIGHT HAVE FOUND THAT IN SIR
PHILIP'S FACE WHEREBY TO CORRECT HIS INFERENCE
EVER SHALLOW HASTY AND
POSITIVE HE WENT HOME QUITE COCK A HOOP
HE WAS NOT A MAN THAT KEPT SECRETS WELL
WHEN ELATE ON A SUBJECT HE
COULD NOT AVOID TALKING ABOUT IT
THE NEXT MORNING HAVING OCCASION TO
EMPLOY HIS SON'S TUTOR AS HIS SECRETARY HE MUST NEEDS ANNOUNCE TO HIM
IN MOUTHING ACCENTS AND WITH MUCH FLIMSY POMP OF MANNER THAT HE HAD
BETTER HOLD HIMSELF PREPARED FOR A RETURN TO THE SOUTH AT AN EARLY DAY
AS THE IMPORTANT BUSINESS WHICH HAD DETAINED HIM MR
SYMPSON SO LONG
IN YORKSHIRE WAS NOW ON THE EVE OF FORTUNATE COMPLETION
HIS ANXIOUS AND
LABORIOUS EFFORTS WERE LIKELY AT LAST TO BE CROWNED WITH THE HAPPIEST
SUCCESS
A TRULY ELIGIBLE ADDITION WAS ABOUT TO BE MADE TO THE FAMILY
CONNECTIONS
IN SIR PHILIP NUNNELY LOUIS MOORE CONJECTURED
WHEREUPON MR
SYMPSON TREATED HIMSELF SIMULTANEOUSLY TO A PINCH OF SNUFF
AND A CHUCKLING LAUGH CHECKED ONLY BY A SUDDEN CHOKE OF DIGNITY AND AN
ORDER TO THE TUTOR TO PROCEED WITH BUSINESS
FOR A DAY OR TWO MR
SYMPSON CONTINUED AS BLAND AS OIL BUT ALSO HE
SEEMED TO SIT ON PINS AND HIS GAIT WHEN HE WALKED EMULATED THAT OF A
HEN TREADING A HOT GIRDLE
HE WAS FOR EVER LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND
LISTENING FOR CHARIOT WHEELS
BLUEBEARD'S WIFE SISERA'S MOTHER WERE
NOTHING TO HIM
HE WAITED WHEN THE MATTER SHOULD BE OPENED IN FORM WHEN
HIMSELF SHOULD BE CONSULTED WHEN LAWYERS SHOULD BE SUMMONED WHEN
SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS AND ALL THE DELICIOUS WORLDLY FUSS SHOULD
POMPOUSLY BEGIN
AT LAST THERE CAME A LETTER
HE HIMSELF HANDED IT TO MISS KEELDAR OUT OF
THE BAG
HE KNEW THE HANDWRITING HE KNEW THE CREST ON THE SEAL
HE DID
NOT SEE IT OPENED AND READ FOR SHIRLEY TOOK IT TO HER OWN ROOM NOR DID
HE SEE IT ANSWERED FOR SHE WROTE HER REPLY SHUT UP AND WAS VERY LONG
ABOUT IT THE BEST PART OF A DAY
HE QUESTIONED HER WHETHER IT WAS
ANSWERED SHE RESPONDED YES
AGAIN HE WAITED WAITED IN SILENCE ABSOLUTELY NOT DARING TO SPEAK KEPT
MUTE BY SOMETHING IN SHIRLEY'S FACE A VERY AWFUL SOMETHING INSCRUTABLE
TO HIM AS THE WRITING ON THE WALL TO BELSHAZZAR
HE WAS MOVED MORE THAN
ONCE TO CALL DANIEL IN THE PERSON OF LOUIS MOORE AND TO ASK AN
INTERPRETATION BUT HIS DIGNITY FORBADE THE FAMILIARITY
DANIEL HIMSELF
PERHAPS HAD HIS OWN PRIVATE DIFFICULTIES CONNECTED WITH THAT BAFFLING
BIT OF TRANSLATION HE LOOKED LIKE A STUDENT FOR WHOM GRAMMARS ARE BLANK
AND DICTIONARIES DUMB
MR
SYMPSON HAD BEEN OUT TO WHILE AWAY AN ANXIOUS HOUR IN THE SOCIETY
OF HIS FRIENDS AT DE WALDEN HALL
HE RETURNED A LITTLE SOONER THAN WAS
EXPECTED
HIS FAMILY AND MISS KEELDAR WERE ASSEMBLED IN THE OAK PARLOUR
ADDRESSING THE LATTER HE REQUESTED HER TO STEP WITH HIM INTO ANOTHER
ROOM
HE WISHED TO HAVE WITH HER A STRICTLY PRIVATE INTERVIEW
SHE ROSE ASKING NO QUESTIONS AND PROFESSING NO SURPRISE
VERY WELL SIR SHE SAID IN THE TONE OF A DETERMINED PERSON WHO IS
INFORMED THAT THE DENTIST IS COME TO EXTRACT THAT LARGE DOUBLE TOOTH OF
HIS FROM WHICH HE HAS SUFFERED SUCH A PURGATORY THIS MONTH PAST
SHE
LEFT HER SEWING AND HER THIMBLE IN THE WINDOW SEAT AND FOLLOWED HER
UNCLE WHERE HE LED
SHUT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM THE PAIR TOOK SEATS EACH IN AN ARM CHAIR
PLACED OPPOSITE A FEW YARDS BETWEEN THEM
I HAVE BEEN TO DE WALDEN HALL SAID MR
SYMPSON
HE PAUSED
MISS
KEELDAR'S EYES WERE ON THE PRETTY WHITE AND GREEN CARPET
THAT
INFORMATION REQUIRED NO RESPONSE
SHE GAVE NONE
I HAVE LEARNED HE WENT ON SLOWLY I HAVE LEARNED A CIRCUMSTANCE
WHICH SURPRISES ME
RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER FOREFINGER SHE WAITED TO BE TOLD WHAT
CIRCUMSTANCE
IT SEEMS THAT NUNNELY PRIORY IS SHUT UP THAT THE FAMILY ARE GONE BACK
TO THEIR PLACE IN SHIRE
IT SEEMS THAT THE BARONET THAT THE
BARONET THAT SIR PHILIP HIMSELF HAS ACCOMPANIED HIS MOTHER AND
SISTERS
INDEED SAID SHIRLEY

SINCERELY SPEAKING I AM SORRY UNCLE YOU ARE SO DISAPPOINTED
CONCESSION CONTRITION NEVER DO ANY GOOD WITH SOME PEOPLE
INSTEAD OF
SOFTENING AND CONCILIATING THEY BUT EMBOLDEN AND HARDEN THEM
OF THAT
NUMBER WAS MR
SYMPSON
I DISAPPOINTED WHAT IS IT TO ME HAVE I AN INTEREST IN IT YOU
WOULD INSINUATE PERHAPS THAT I HAVE MOTIVES
MOST PEOPLE HAVE MOTIVES OF SOME SORT FOR THEIR ACTIONS
SHE ACCUSES ME TO MY FACE I THAT HAVE BEEN A PARENT TO HER SHE
CHARGES WITH BAD MOTIVES
BAD MOTIVES I DID NOT SAY
AND NOW YOU PREVARICATE YOU HAVE NO PRINCIPLES
UNCLE YOU TIRE ME
I WANT TO GO AWAY
GO YOU SHALL NOT I WILL BE ANSWERED
WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS MISS
KEELDAR
IN WHAT RESPECT
IN RESPECT OF MATRIMONY
TO BE QUIET AND TO DO JUST AS I PLEASE
JUST AS YOU PLEASE THE WORDS ARE TO THE LAST DEGREE INDECOROUS
MR
SYMPSON I ADVISE YOU NOT TO BECOME INSULTING
YOU KNOW I WILL NOT
BEAR THAT
YOU READ FRENCH
YOUR MIND IS POISONED WITH FRENCH NOVELS
YOU HAVE
IMBIBED FRENCH PRINCIPLES
THE GROUND YOU ARE TREADING NOW RETURNS A MIGHTY HOLLOW SOUND UNDER
YOUR FEET
BEWARE
IT WILL END IN INFAMY SOONER OR LATER
I HAVE FORESEEN IT ALL ALONG
DO YOU ASSERT SIR THAT SOMETHING IN WHICH I AM CONCERNED WILL END
IN INFAMY
THAT IT WILL THAT IT WILL
YOU SAID JUST NOW YOU WOULD ACT AS YOU
PLEASE
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE NO RULES NO LIMITATIONS
SILLY STUFF AND VULGAR AS SILLY
REGARDLESS OF DECORUM YOU ARE PREPARED TO FLY IN THE FACE OF
PROPRIETY
YOU TIRE ME UNCLE
WHAT MADAM WHAT COULD BE YOUR REASONS FOR REFUSING SIR PHILIP
AT LAST THERE IS ANOTHER SENSIBLE QUESTION I SHALL BE GLAD TO REPLY TO
IT
SIR PHILIP IS TOO YOUNG FOR ME
I REGARD HIM AS A BOY
ALL HIS
RELATIONS HIS MOTHER ESPECIALLY WOULD BE ANNOYED IF HE MARRIED ME
SUCH A STEP WOULD EMBROIL HIM WITH THEM
I AM NOT HIS EQUAL IN THE
WORLD'S ESTIMATION
IS THAT ALL
OUR DISPOSITIONS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE
WHY A MORE AMIABLE GENTLEMAN NEVER BREATHED
HE IS VERY AMIABLE VERY EXCELLENT TRULY ESTIMABLE BUT NOT MY
MASTER NOT IN ONE POINT
I COULD NOT TRUST MYSELF WITH HIS HAPPINESS
I WOULD NOT UNDERTAKE THE KEEPING OF IT FOR THOUSANDS
I WILL ACCEPT NO
HAND WHICH CANNOT HOLD ME IN CHECK
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED TO DO AS YOU PLEASE
YOU ARE VASTLY INCONSISTENT
WHEN I PROMISE TO OBEY IT SHALL BE UNDER THE CONVICTION THAT I CAN
KEEP THAT PROMISE
I COULD NOT OBEY A YOUTH LIKE SIR PHILIP
BESIDES HE
WOULD NEVER COMMAND ME
HE WOULD EXPECT ME ALWAYS TO RULE TO GUIDE AND
I HAVE NO TASTE WHATEVER FOR THE OFFICE
YOU NO TASTE FOR SWAGGERING AND SUBDUING AND ORDERING AND RULING
NOT MY HUSBAND ONLY MY UNCLE
WHERE IS THE DIFFERENCE
THERE IS A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE THAT IS CERTAIN
AND I KNOW FULL WELL
ANY MAN WHO WISHES TO LIVE IN DECENT COMFORT WITH ME AS A HUSBAND MUST
BE ABLE TO CONTROL ME
I WISH YOU HAD A REAL TYRANT
A TYRANT WOULD NOT HOLD ME FOR A DAY NOT FOR AN HOUR
I WOULD
REBEL BREAK FROM HIM DEFY HIM
ARE YOU NOT ENOUGH TO BEWILDER ONE'S BRAIN WITH YOUR
SELF CONTRADICTION
IT IS EVIDENT I BEWILDER YOUR BRAIN
YOU TALK OF SIR PHILIP BEING YOUNG
HE IS TWO AND TWENTY
MY HUSBAND MUST BE THIRTY WITH THE SENSE OF FORTY
YOU HAD BETTER PICK OUT SOME OLD MAN SOME WHITE HEADED OR BALD HEADED
SWAIN
NO THANK YOU
YOU COULD LEAD SOME DOTING FOOL YOU MIGHT PIN HIM TO YOUR APRON
I MIGHT DO THAT WITH A BOY BUT IT IS NOT MY VOCATION
DID I NOT SAY I
PREFER A MASTER ONE IN WHOSE PRESENCE I SHALL FEEL OBLIGED AND
DISPOSED TO BE GOOD ONE WHOSE CONTROL MY IMPATIENT TEMPER MUST
ACKNOWLEDGE A MAN WHOSE APPROBATION CAN REWARD WHOSE DISPLEASURE
PUNISH ME A MAN I SHALL FEEL IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO LOVE AND VERY
POSSIBLE TO FEAR
WHAT IS THERE TO HINDER YOU FROM DOING ALL THIS WITH SIR PHILIP HE IS
A BARONET A MAN OF RANK PROPERTY CONNECTIONS FAR ABOVE YOURS
IF YOU
TALK OF INTELLECT HE IS A POET HE WRITES VERSES WHICH YOU I TAKE IT
CANNOT DO WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS
NEITHER HIS TITLE WEALTH PEDIGREE NOR POETRY AVAIL TO INVEST HIM
WITH THE POWER I DESCRIBE
THESE ARE FEATHER WEIGHTS THEY WANT BALLAST
A MEASURE OF SOUND SOLID PRACTICAL SENSE WOULD HAVE STOOD HIM IN
BETTER STEAD WITH ME
YOU AND HENRY RAVE ABOUT POETRY YOU USED TO CATCH FIRE LIKE TINDER ON
THE SUBJECT WHEN YOU WERE A GIRL
O UNCLE THERE IS NOTHING REALLY VALUABLE IN THIS WORLD THERE IS
NOTHING GLORIOUS IN THE WORLD TO COME THAT IS NOT POETRY
MARRY A POET THEN IN GOD'S NAME
SHOW HIM ME AND I WILL
SIR PHILIP
NOT AT ALL
YOU ARE ALMOST AS GOOD A POET AS HE
MADAM YOU ARE WANDERING FROM THE POINT
INDEED UNCLE I WANTED TO DO SO AND I SHALL BE GLAD TO LEAD YOU AWAY
WITH ME
DO NOT LET US GET OUT OF TEMPER WITH EACH OTHER IT IS NOT
WORTH WHILE
OUT OF TEMPER MISS KEELDAR I SHOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW WHO IS OUT OF
TEMPER
I AM NOT YET
IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE THAT I AM I CONSIDER THAT YOU ARE GUILTY OF
IMPERTINENCE
YOU WILL BE SOON IF YOU GO ON AT THAT RATE
THERE IT IS WITH YOUR PERT TONGUE YOU WOULD TRY THE PATIENCE OF A
JOB
I KNOW I SHOULD
NO LEVITY MISS THIS IS NOT A LAUGHING MATTER
IT IS AN AFFAIR I AM
RESOLVED TO PROBE THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THERE IS MISCHIEF AT THE
BOTTOM
YOU DESCRIBED JUST NOW WITH FAR TOO MUCH FREEDOM FOR YOUR YEARS
AND SEX THE SORT OF INDIVIDUAL YOU WOULD PREFER AS A HUSBAND
PRAY DID
YOU PAINT FROM THE LIFE
SHIRLEY OPENED HER LIPS BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE ONLY GLOWED
ROSE RED
I SHALL HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION AFFIRMED MR
SYMPSON
ASSUMING VAST COURAGE AND CONSEQUENCE ON THE STRENGTH OF THIS SYMPTOM OF
CONFUSION
IT WAS AN HISTORICAL PICTURE UNCLE FROM SEVERAL ORIGINALS
SEVERAL ORIGINALS BLESS MY HEART
I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE SEVERAL TIMES
THIS IS CYNICAL
WITH HEROES OF MANY NATIONS
WHAT NEXT
AND PHILOSOPHERS
SHE IS MAD
DON'T RING THE BELL UNCLE YOU WILL ALARM MY AUNT
YOUR POOR DEAR AUNT WHAT A NIECE HAS SHE
ONCE I LOVED SOCRATES
POOH NO TRIFLING MA'AM
I ADMIRED THEMISTOCLES LEONIDAS EPAMINONDAS
MISS KEELDAR
TO PASS OVER A FEW CENTURIES WASHINGTON WAS A PLAIN MAN BUT I LIKED
HIM BUT TO SPEAK OF THE ACTUAL PRESENT
AH THE ACTUAL PRESENT
TO QUIT CRUDE SCHOOLGIRL FANCIES AND COME TO REALITIES
REALITIES THAT IS THE TEST TO WHICH YOU SHALL BE BROUGHT MA'AM
TO AVOW BEFORE WHAT ALTAR I NOW KNEEL TO REVEAL THE PRESENT IDOL OF MY
SOUL
YOU WILL MAKE HASTE ABOUT IT IF YOU PLEASE
IT IS NEAR LUNCHEON TIME
AND CONFESS YOU SHALL
CONFESS I MUST
MY HEART IS FULL OF THE SECRET
IT MUST BE SPOKEN
I
ONLY WISH YOU WERE MR
HELSTONE INSTEAD OF MR
SYMPSON YOU WOULD
SYMPATHIZE WITH ME BETTER
MADAM IT IS A QUESTION OF COMMON SENSE AND COMMON PRUDENCE NOT OF
SYMPATHY AND SENTIMENT AND SO ON
DID YOU SAY IT WAS MR
HELSTONE
NOT PRECISELY BUT AS NEAR AS MAY BE THEY ARE RATHER ALIKE
I WILL KNOW THE NAME I WILL HAVE PARTICULARS
THEY POSITIVELY ARE RATHER ALIKE
THEIR VERY FACES ARE NOT
DISSIMILAR A PAIR OF HUMAN FALCONS AND DRY DIRECT DECIDED BOTH
BUT
MY HERO IS THE MIGHTIER OF THE TWO

BEHOLD HOW HIDEOUSLY HE GOVERNS SEE HIM BUSIED AT THE WORK HE LIKES
BEST MAKING MARRIAGES
HE BINDS THE YOUNG TO THE OLD THE STRONG TO THE
IMBECILE
HE STRETCHES OUT THE ARM OF MEZENTIUS AND FETTERS THE DEAD TO
THE LIVING
IN HIS REALM THERE IS HATRED SECRET HATRED THERE IS
DISGUST UNSPOKEN DISGUST THERE IS TREACHERY FAMILY TREACHERY THERE
IS VICE DEEP DEADLY DOMESTIC VICE
IN HIS DOMINIONS CHILDREN GROW
UNLOVING BETWEEN PARENTS WHO HAVE NEVER LOVED INFANTS ARE NURSED ON
DECEPTION FROM THEIR VERY BIRTH THEY ARE REARED IN AN ATMOSPHERE
CORRUPT WITH LIES
YOUR GOD RULES AT THE BRIDAL OF KINGS LOOK AT YOUR

ANALYZE THE BLUE BLOOD OF SPAIN YOUR GOD IS THE HYMEN OF FRANCE WHAT

YOUR GOD IS A MASKED
DEATH
THIS LANGUAGE IS TERRIBLE MY DAUGHTERS AND YOU MUST ASSOCIATE NO
LONGER MISS KEELDAR THERE IS DANGER IN SUCH COMPANIONSHIP
HAD I KNOWN
YOU A LITTLE EARLIER BUT EXTRAORDINARY AS I THOUGHT YOU I COULD NOT
HAVE BELIEVED
NOW SIR DO YOU BEGIN TO BE AWARE THAT IT IS USELESS TO SCHEME FOR ME
THAT IN DOING SO YOU BUT SOW THE WIND TO REAP THE WHIRLWIND I SWEEP
YOUR COBWEB PROJECTS FROM MY PATH THAT I MAY PASS ON UNSULLIED
I AM
ANCHORED ON A RESOLVE YOU CANNOT SHAKE
MY HEART MY CONSCIENCE SHALL
DISPOSE OF MY HAND THEY ONLY
KNOW THIS AT LAST
MR
SYMPSON WAS BECOMING A LITTLE BEWILDERED
NEVER HEARD SUCH LANGUAGE HE MUTTERED AGAIN AND AGAIN NEVER WAS SO
ADDRESSED IN MY LIFE NEVER WAS SO USED
YOU ARE QUITE CONFUSED SIR
YOU HAD BETTER WITHDRAW OR I WILL
HE ROSE HASTILY
WE MUST LEAVE THIS PLACE THEY MUST PACK UP AT ONCE
DO NOT HURRY MY AUNT AND COUSINS GIVE THEM TIME
NO MORE INTERCOURSE SHE'S NOT PROPER
HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE DOOR
HE CAME BACK FOR HIS HANDKERCHIEF
HE
DROPPED HIS SNUFF BOX LEAVING THE CONTENTS SCATTERED ON THE CARPET HE
STUMBLED OUT
TARTAR LAY OUTSIDE ACROSS THE MAT MR
SYMPSON ALMOST FELL
OVER HIM
IN THE CLIMAX OF HIS EXASPERATION HE HURLED AN OATH AT THE DOG
AND A COARSE EPITHET AT HIS MISTRESS
POOR MR
SYMPSON HE IS BOTH FEEBLE AND VULGAR SAID SHIRLEY TO
HERSELF
MY HEAD ACHES AND I AM TIRED SHE ADDED AND LEANING HER
HEAD UPON A CUSHION SHE SOFTLY SUBSIDED FROM EXCITEMENT TO REPOSE
ONE
ENTERING THE ROOM A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS FOUND HER ASLEEP
WHEN SHIRLEY HAD BEEN AGITATED SHE GENERALLY TOOK THIS NATURAL
REFRESHMENT IT WOULD COME AT HER CALL
THE INTRUDER PAUSED IN HER UNCONSCIOUS PRESENCE AND SAID MISS
KEELDAR
PERHAPS HIS VOICE HARMONIZED WITH SOME DREAM INTO WHICH SHE WAS PASSING
IT DID NOT STARTLE IT HARDLY ROUSED HER
WITHOUT OPENING HER EYES SHE
BUT TURNED HER HEAD A LITTLE SO THAT HER CHEEK AND PROFILE BEFORE
HIDDEN BY HER ARM BECAME VISIBLE
SHE LOOKED ROSY HAPPY HALF SMILING
BUT HER EYELASHES WERE WET
SHE HAD WEPT IN SLUMBER OR PERHAPS BEFORE
DROPPING ASLEEP A FEW NATURAL TEARS HAD FALLEN AFTER SHE HAD HEARD THAT
EPITHET
NO MAN NO WOMAN IS ALWAYS STRONG ALWAYS ABLE TO BEAR UP
AGAINST THE UNJUST OPINION THE VILIFYING WORD
CALUMNY EVEN FROM THE
MOUTH OF A FOOL WILL SOMETIMES CUT INTO UNGUARDED FEELINGS
SHIRLEY
LOOKED LIKE A CHILD THAT HAD BEEN NAUGHTY AND PUNISHED BUT WAS NOW
FORGIVEN AND AT REST
MISS KEELDAR AGAIN SAID THE VOICE
THIS TIME IT WOKE HER
SHE LOOKED
UP AND SAW AT HER SIDE LOUIS MOORE NOT CLOSE AT HER SIDE BUT
STANDING WITH ARRESTED STEP TWO OR THREE YARDS FROM HER
O MR
MOORE SHE SAID
I WAS AFRAID IT WAS MY UNCLE AGAIN HE AND I
HAVE QUARRELLED
MR
SYMPSON SHOULD LET YOU ALONE WAS THE REPLY
CAN HE NOT SEE THAT
YOU ARE AS YET FAR FROM STRONG
I ASSURE YOU HE DID NOT FIND ME WEAK
I DID NOT CRY WHEN HE WAS HERE
HE IS ABOUT TO EVACUATE FIELDHEAD SO HE SAYS
HE IS NOW GIVING ORDERS
TO HIS FAMILY
HE HAS BEEN IN THE SCHOOLROOM ISSUING COMMANDS IN A
MANNER WHICH I SUPPOSE WAS A CONTINUATION OF THAT WITH WHICH HE HAS
HARASSED YOU
ARE YOU AND HENRY TO GO
I BELIEVE AS FAR AS HENRY IS CONCERNED THAT WAS THE TENOR OF HIS
SCARCELY INTELLIGIBLE DIRECTIONS BUT HE MAY CHANGE ALL TO MORROW
HE IS
JUST IN THAT MOOD WHEN YOU CANNOT DEPEND ON HIS CONSISTENCY FOR TWO
CONSECUTIVE HOURS
I DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL LEAVE YOU FOR WEEKS YET
TO
MYSELF HE ADDRESSED SOME WORDS WHICH WILL REQUIRE A LITTLE ATTENTION AND
COMMENT BY AND BY WHEN I HAVE TIME TO BESTOW ON THEM
AT THE MOMENT HE
CAME IN I WAS BUSIED WITH A NOTE I HAD GOT FROM MR
YORKE SO FULLY
BUSIED THAT I CUT SHORT THE INTERVIEW WITH HIM SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY
I LEFT
HIM RAVING
HERE IS THE NOTE
I WISH YOU TO SEE IT
IT REFERS TO MY
BROTHER ROBERT AND HE LOOKED AT SHIRLEY
I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR NEWS OF HIM
IS HE COMING HOME
HE IS COME
HE IS IN YORKSHIRE
MR
YORKE WENT YESTERDAY TO STILBRO' TO
MEET HIM
MR
MOORE SOMETHING IS WRONG
DID MY VOICE TREMBLE HE IS NOW AT BRIARMAINS AND I AM GOING TO SEE
HIM

IF YOU TURN SO PALE I SHALL BE SORRY I HAVE SPOKEN
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
WORSE
ROBERT IS NOT DEAD BUT MUCH HURT
O SIR IT IS YOU WHO ARE PALE
SIT DOWN NEAR ME

MISS KEELDAR READ THE NOTE
IT BRIEFLY SIGNIFIED THAT LAST NIGHT ROBERT
MOORE HAD BEEN SHOT AT FROM BEHIND THE WALL OF MILLDEAN PLANTATION AT
THE FOOT OF THE BROW THAT HE WAS WOUNDED SEVERELY BUT IT WAS HOPED NOT
FATALLY
OF THE ASSASSIN OR ASSASSINS NOTHING WAS KNOWN THEY HAD
ESCAPED
NO DOUBT MR
YORKE OBSERVED IT WAS DONE IN REVENGE
IT WAS
A PITY ILL WILL HAD EVER BEEN RAISED BUT THAT COULD NOT BE HELPED NOW
HE IS MY ONLY BROTHER SAID LOUIS AS SHIRLEY RETURNED THE NOTE
I
CANNOT HEAR UNMOVED THAT RUFFIANS HAVE LAID IN WAIT FOR HIM AND SHOT
HIM DOWN LIKE SOME WILD BEAST FROM BEHIND A WALL
BE COMFORTED BE HOPEFUL
HE WILL GET BETTER I KNOW HE WILL
SHIRLEY SOLICITOUS TO SOOTHE HELD HER HAND OVER MR
MOORE'S AS IT LAY
ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR
SHE JUST TOUCHED IT LIGHTLY SCARCE PALPABLY
WELL GIVE ME YOUR HAND HE SAID
IT WILL BE FOR THE FIRST TIME IT
IS IN A MOMENT OF CALAMITY
GIVE IT ME
AWAITING NEITHER CONSENT NOR REFUSAL HE TOOK WHAT HE ASKED
I AM GOING TO BRIARMAINS NOW HE WENT ON
I WANT YOU TO STEP OVER TO
THE RECTORY AND TELL CAROLINE HELSTONE WHAT HAS HAPPENED

IMMEDIATELY SAID SHIRLEY WITH DOCILE PROMPTITUDE
OUGHT I TO SAY
THAT THERE IS NO DANGER
SAY SO
YOU WILL COME BACK SOON AND LET ME KNOW MORE
I WILL EITHER COME OR WRITE
TRUST ME FOR WATCHING OVER CAROLINE
I WILL COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR
SISTER TOO BUT DOUBTLESS SHE IS ALREADY WITH ROBERT
DOUBTLESS OR WILL BE SOON
GOOD MORNING NOW
YOU WILL BEAR UP COME WHAT MAY
WE SHALL SEE THAT
SHIRLEY'S FINGERS WERE OBLIGED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE TUTOR'S
LOUIS WAS
OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH THAT HAND FOLDED CLASPED HIDDEN IN HIS OWN
I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO SUPPORT HER HE SAID AS HE WALKED
TOWARDS BRIARMAINS AND IT IS SHE WHO HAS MADE ME STRONG
THAT LOOK OF
PITY THAT GENTLE TOUCH NO DOWN WAS EVER SOFTER NO ELIXIR MORE POTENT
IT LAY LIKE A SNOWFLAKE IT THRILLED LIKE LIGHTNING
A THOUSAND TIMES I
HAVE LONGED TO POSSESS THAT HAND TO HAVE IT IN MINE
I HAVE POSSESSED
IT FOR FIVE MINUTES I HELD IT
HER FINGERS AND MINE CAN NEVER BE
STRANGERS MORE
HAVING MET ONCE THEY MUST MEET AGAIN
CHAPTER XXXII
THE SCHOOLBOY AND THE WOOD NYMPH
BRIARMAINS BEING NEARER THAN THE HOLLOW MR
YORKE HAD CONVEYED HIS
YOUNG COMRADE THERE
HE HAD SEEN HIM LAID IN THE BEST BED OF THE HOUSE
AS CAREFULLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN ONE OF HIS OWN SONS
THE SIGHT OF HIS
BLOOD WELLING FROM THE TREACHEROUSLY INFLICTED WOUND MADE HIM INDEED
THE SON OF THE YORKSHIRE GENTLEMAN'S HEART
THE SPECTACLE OF THE SUDDEN
EVENT OF THE TALL STRAIGHT SHAPE PROSTRATED IN ITS PRIDE ACROSS THE
ROAD OF THE FINE SOUTHERN HEAD LAID LOW IN THE DUST OF THAT YOUTH IN
PRIME FLUNG AT ONCE BEFORE HIM PALLID LIFELESS HELPLESS THIS WAS THE
VERY COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES TO WIN FOR THE VICTIM MR
YORKE'S
LIVELIEST INTEREST
NO OTHER HAND WAS THERE TO RAISE TO AID NO OTHER VOICE TO QUESTION
KINDLY NO OTHER BRAIN TO CONCERT MEASURES HE HAD TO DO IT ALL HIMSELF
THIS UTTER DEPENDENCE OF THE SPEECHLESS BLEEDING YOUTH AS A YOUTH HE
REGARDED HIM ON HIS BENEVOLENCE SECURED THAT BENEVOLENCE MOST
EFFECTUALLY
WELL DID MR
YORKE LIKE TO HAVE POWER AND TO USE IT
HE
HAD NOW BETWEEN HIS HANDS POWER OVER A FELLOW CREATURE'S LIFE
IT SUITED
HIM
NO LESS PERFECTLY DID IT SUIT HIS SATURNINE BETTER HALF
THE INCIDENT
WAS QUITE IN HER WAY AND TO HER TASTE
SOME WOMEN WOULD HAVE BEEN
TERROR STRUCK TO SEE A GORY MAN BROUGHT IN OVER THEIR THRESHOLD AND
LAID DOWN IN THEIR HALL IN THE HOWE OF THE NIGHT THERE YOU WOULD
SUPPOSE WAS SUBJECT MATTER FOR HYSTERICS
NO
MRS
YORKE WENT INTO
HYSTERICS WHEN JESSIE WOULD NOT LEAVE THE GARDEN TO COME TO HER
KNITTING OR WHEN MARTIN PROPOSED STARTING FOR AUSTRALIA WITH A VIEW TO
REALIZE FREEDOM AND ESCAPE THE TYRANNY OF MATTHEW BUT AN ATTEMPTED
MURDER NEAR HER DOOR A HALF MURDERED MAN IN HER BEST BED SET HER
STRAIGHT CHEERED HER SPIRITS GAVE HER CAP THE DASH OF A TURBAN
MRS
YORKE WAS JUST THE WOMAN WHO WHILE RENDERING MISERABLE THE
DRUDGING LIFE OF A SIMPLE MAID SERVANT WOULD NURSE LIKE A HEROINE A
HOSPITAL FULL OF PLAGUE PATIENTS
SHE ALMOST LOVED MOORE
HER TOUGH
HEART ALMOST YEARNED TOWARDS HIM WHEN SHE FOUND HIM COMMITTED TO HER
CHARGE LEFT IN HER ARMS AS DEPENDENT ON HER AS HER YOUNGEST BORN IN
THE CRADLE
HAD SHE SEEN A DOMESTIC OR ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS GIVE HIM A
DRAUGHT OF WATER OR SMOOTH HIS PILLOW SHE WOULD HAVE BOXED THE
INTRUDER'S EARS
SHE CHASED JESSIE AND ROSE FROM THE UPPER REALM OF THE
HOUSE SHE FORBADE THE HOUSEMAIDS TO SET THEIR FOOT IN IT
NOW IF THE ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED AT THE RECTORY GATES AND OLD HELSTONE
HAD TAKEN IN THE MARTYR NEITHER YORKE NOR HIS WIFE WOULD HAVE PITIED
HIM
THEY WOULD HAVE ADJUDGED HIM RIGHT SERVED FOR HIS TYRANNY AND
MEDDLING
AS IT WAS HE BECAME FOR THE PRESENT THE APPLE OF THEIR EYE
STRANGE LOUIS MOORE WAS PERMITTED TO COME TO SIT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF
THE BED AND LEAN OVER THE PILLOW TO HOLD HIS BROTHER'S HAND AND PRESS
HIS PALE FOREHEAD WITH HIS FRATERNAL LIPS AND MRS
YORKE BORE IT WELL
SHE SUFFERED HIM TO STAY HALF THE DAY THERE SHE ONCE SUFFERED HIM TO
SIT UP ALL NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER SHE ROSE HERSELF AT FIVE O'CLOCK OF A
WET NOVEMBER MORNING AND WITH HER OWN HANDS LIT THE KITCHEN FIRE AND
MADE THE BROTHERS A BREAKFAST AND SERVED IT TO THEM HERSELF
MAJESTICALLY ARRAYED IN A BOUNDLESS FLANNEL WRAPPER A SHAWL AND HER
NIGHTCAP SHE SAT AND WATCHED THEM EAT AS COMPLACENTLY AS A HEN BEHOLDS
HER CHICKENS FEED
YET SHE GAVE THE COOK WARNING THAT DAY FOR VENTURING
TO MAKE AND CARRY UP TO MR
MOORE A BASIN OF SAGO GRUEL AND THE
HOUSEMAID LOST HER FAVOUR BECAUSE WHEN MR
LOUIS WAS DEPARTING SHE
BROUGHT HIM HIS SURTOUT AIRED FROM THE KITCHEN AND LIKE A FORWARD
PIECE AS SHE WAS HELPED HIM ON WITH IT AND ACCEPTED IN RETURN A
SMILE A THANK YOU MY GIRL AND A SHILLING
TWO LADIES CALLED ONE
DAY PALE AND ANXIOUS AND BEGGED EARNESTLY HUMBLY TO BE ALLOWED TO
SEE MR
MOORE ONE INSTANT
MRS
YORKE HARDENED HER HEART AND SENT THEM
PACKING NOT WITHOUT OPPROBRIUM
BUT HOW WAS IT WHEN HORTENSE MOORE CAME NOT SO BAD AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN
EXPECTED
THE WHOLE FAMILY OF THE MOORES REALLY SEEMED TO SUIT MRS
YORKE SO AS NO OTHER FAMILY HAD EVER SUITED HER
HORTENSE AND SHE
POSSESSED AN EXHAUSTLESS MUTUAL THEME OF CONVERSATION IN THE CORRUPT
PROPENSITIES OF SERVANTS
THEIR VIEWS OF THIS CLASS WERE SIMILAR THEY
WATCHED THEM WITH THE SAME SUSPICION AND JUDGED THEM WITH THE SAME
SEVERITY
HORTENSE TOO FROM THE VERY FIRST SHOWED NO MANNER OF
JEALOUSY OF MRS
YORKE'S ATTENTIONS TO ROBERT SHE LET HER KEEP THE POST
OF NURSE WITH LITTLE INTERFERENCE AND FOR HERSELF FOUND CEASELESS
OCCUPATION IN FIDGETING ABOUT THE HOUSE HOLDING THE KITCHEN UNDER
SURVEILLANCE REPORTING WHAT PASSED THERE AND IN SHORT MAKING HERSELF
GENERALLY USEFUL
VISITORS THEY BOTH OF THEM AGREED IN EXCLUDING
SEDULOUSLY FROM THE SICKROOM
THEY HELD THE YOUNG MILL OWNER CAPTIVE
AND HARDLY LET THE AIR BREATHE OR THE SUN SHINE ON HIM
MR
MACTURK THE SURGEON TO WHOM MOORE'S CASE HAD BEEN COMMITTED
PRONOUNCED HIS WOUND OF A DANGEROUS BUT HE TRUSTED NOT OF A HOPELESS
CHARACTER
AT FIRST HE WISHED TO PLACE WITH HIM A NURSE OF HIS OWN
SELECTION BUT THIS NEITHER MRS
YORKE NOR HORTENSE WOULD HEAR OF
THEY
PROMISED FAITHFUL OBSERVANCE OF DIRECTIONS
HE WAS LEFT THEREFORE FOR
THE PRESENT IN THEIR HANDS
DOUBTLESS THEY EXECUTED THE TRUST TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY BUT
SOMETHING GOT WRONG
THE BANDAGES WERE DISPLACED OR TAMPERED WITH GREAT
LOSS OF BLOOD FOLLOWED
MACTURK BEING SUMMONED CAME WITH STEED AFOAM
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE SURGEONS WHOM IT IS DANGEROUS TO VEX ABRUPT IN HIS
BEST MOODS IN HIS WORST SAVAGE
ON SEEING MOORE'S STATE HE RELIEVED HIS
FEELINGS BY A LITTLE FLOWERY LANGUAGE WITH WHICH IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO
STREW THE PRESENT PAGE
A BOUQUET OR TWO OF THE CHOICEST BLOSSOMS FELL
ON THE UNPERTURBED HEAD OF ONE MR
GRAVES A STONY YOUNG ASSISTANT HE
USUALLY CARRIED ABOUT WITH HIM WITH A SECOND NOSEGAY HE GIFTED ANOTHER
YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN HIS TRAIN AN INTERESTING FAC SIMILE OF HIMSELF
BEING INDEED HIS OWN SON BUT THE FULL CORBEILLE OF BLUSHING BLOOM
FELL TO THE LOT OF MEDDLING WOMANKIND EN MASSE
FOR THE BEST PART OF ONE WINTER NIGHT HIMSELF AND SATELLITES WERE BUSIED
ABOUT MOORE
THERE AT HIS BEDSIDE SHUT UP ALONE WITH HIM IN HIS
CHAMBER THEY WROUGHT AND WRANGLED OVER HIS EXHAUSTED FRAME
THEY THREE
WERE ON ONE SIDE OF THE BED AND DEATH ON THE OTHER
THE CONFLICT WAS
SHARP IT LASTED TILL DAY BROKE WHEN THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE
BELLIGERENTS SEEMED SO EQUAL THAT BOTH PARTIES MIGHT HAVE CLAIMED THE
VICTORY
AT DAWN GRAVES AND YOUNG MACTURK WERE LEFT IN CHARGE OF THE PATIENT
WHILE THE SENIOR WENT HIMSELF IN SEARCH OF ADDITIONAL STRENGTH AND
SECURED IT IN THE PERSON OF MRS
HORSFALL THE BEST NURSE ON HIS STAFF
TO THIS WOMAN HE GAVE MOORE IN CHARGE WITH THE STERNEST INJUNCTIONS
RESPECTING THE RESPONSIBILITY LAID ON HER SHOULDERS
SHE TOOK THIS
RESPONSIBILITY STOLIDLY AS SHE DID ALSO THE EASY CHAIR AT THE BEDHEAD
THAT MOMENT SHE BEGAN HER REIGN
MRS
HORSFALL HAD ONE VIRTUE ORDERS RECEIVED FROM MACTURK SHE OBEYED TO
THE LETTER
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS WERE LESS BINDING IN HER EYES THAN HER
SURGEON'S DICTUM
IN OTHER RESPECTS SHE WAS NO WOMAN BUT A DRAGON
HORTENSE MOORE FELL EFFACED BEFORE HER MRS
YORKE WITHDREW CRUSHED
YET BOTH THESE WOMEN WERE PERSONAGES OF SOME DIGNITY IN THEIR OWN
ESTIMATION AND OF SOME BULK IN THE ESTIMATION OF OTHERS
PERFECTLY
COWED BY THE BREADTH THE HEIGHT THE BONE AND THE BRAWN OF MRS
HORSFALL THEY RETREATED TO THE BACK PARLOUR
SHE FOR HER PART SAT
UPSTAIRS WHEN SHE LIKED AND DOWNSTAIRS WHEN SHE PREFERRED IT
SHE TOOK
HER DRAM THREE TIMES A DAY AND HER PIPE OF TOBACCO FOUR TIMES
AS TO MOORE NO ONE NOW VENTURED TO INQUIRE ABOUT HIM
MRS
HORSFALL HAD
HIM AT DRY NURSE
IT WAS SHE WHO WAS TO DO FOR HIM AND THE GENERAL
CONJECTURE NOW RAN THAT SHE DID FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY
MORNING AND EVENING MACTURK CAME TO SEE HIM
HIS CASE THUS COMPLICATED
BY A NEW MISCHANCE WAS BECOME ONE OF INTEREST IN THE SURGEON'S EYES
HE
REGARDED HIM AS A DAMAGED PIECE OF CLOCKWORK WHICH IT WOULD BE
CREDITABLE TO HIS SKILL TO SET AGOING AGAIN
GRAVES AND YOUNG
MACTURK MOORE'S SOLE OTHER VISITORS CONTEMPLATED HIM IN THE LIGHT IN
WHICH THEY WERE WONT TO CONTEMPLATE THE OCCUPANT FOR THE TIME BEING OF
THE DISSECTING ROOM AT STILBRO' INFIRMARY
ROBERT MOORE HAD A PLEASANT TIME OF IT IN PAIN IN DANGER TOO WEAK TO
MOVE ALMOST TOO WEAK TO SPEAK A SORT OF GIANTESS HIS KEEPER THE THREE
SURGEONS HIS SOLE SOCIETY
THUS HE LAY THROUGH THE DIMINISHING DAYS AND
LENGTHENING NIGHTS OF THE WHOLE DREAR MONTH OF NOVEMBER
IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS CAPTIVITY MOORE USED FEEBLY TO RESIST MRS
HORSFALL
HE HATED THE SIGHT OF HER ROUGH BULK AND DREADED THE CONTACT
OF HER HARD HANDS BUT SHE TAUGHT HIM DOCILITY IN A TRICE
SHE MADE NO
ACCOUNT WHATEVER OF HIS SIX FEET HIS MANLY THEWS AND SINEWS SHE TURNED
HIM IN HIS BED AS ANOTHER WOMAN WOULD HAVE TURNED A BABE IN ITS CRADLE
WHEN HE WAS GOOD SHE ADDRESSED HIM AS MY DEAR AND HONEY AND WHEN HE
WAS BAD SHE SOMETIMES SHOOK HIM
DID HE ATTEMPT TO SPEAK WHEN MACTURK
WAS THERE SHE LIFTED HER HAND AND BADE HIM HUSH LIKE A NURSE
CHECKING A FORWARD CHILD
IF SHE HAD NOT SMOKED IF SHE HAD NOT TAKEN
GIN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HE THOUGHT BUT SHE DID BOTH
ONCE IN
HER ABSENCE HE INTIMATED TO MACTURK THAT THAT WOMAN WAS A
DRAM DRINKER
POOH MY DEAR SIR THEY ARE ALL SO WAS THE REPLY HE GOT FOR HIS
PAINS
BUT HORSFALL HAS THIS VIRTUE ADDED THE SURGEON DRUNK OR
SOBER SHE ALWAYS REMEMBERS TO OBEY ME
AT LENGTH THE LATTER AUTUMN PASSED ITS FOGS ITS RAINS WITHDREW FROM
ENGLAND THEIR MOURNING AND THEIR TEARS ITS WINDS SWEPT ON TO SIGH OVER
LANDS FAR AWAY
BEHIND NOVEMBER CAME DEEP WINTER CLEARNESS STILLNESS
FROST ACCOMPANYING
A CALM DAY HAD SETTLED INTO A CRYSTALLINE EVENING
THE WORLD WORE A
NORTH POLE COLOURING ALL ITS LIGHTS AND TINTS LOOKED LIKE THE
REFLETS A OF WHITE OR VIOLET OR PALE GREEN GEMS
THE HILLS WORE A
LILAC BLUE THE SETTING SUN HAD PURPLE IN ITS RED THE SKY WAS ICE ALL
SILVERED AZURE WHEN THE STARS ROSE THEY WERE OF WHITE CRYSTAL NOT
GOLD GRAY OR CERULEAN OR FAINT EMERALD HUES COOL PURE AND
TRANSPARENT TINGED THE MASS OF THE LANDSCAPE
A FIND ME AN ENGLISH WORD AS GOOD READER AND I WILL GLADLY
DISPENSE WITH THE FRENCH WORD
REFLECTIONS WON'T DO
WHAT IS THIS BY ITSELF IN A WOOD NO LONGER GREEN NO LONGER EVEN RUSSET
A WOOD NEUTRAL TINT THIS DARK BLUE MOVING OBJECT WHY IT IS A
SCHOOLBOY A BRIARFIELD GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOY WHO HAS LEFT HIS COMPANIONS
NOW TRUDGING HOME BY THE HIGHROAD AND IS SEEKING A CERTAIN TREE WITH A
CERTAIN MOSSY MOUND AT ITS ROOT CONVENIENT AS A SEAT
WHY IS HE
LINGERING HERE THE AIR IS COLD AND THE TIME WEARS LATE
HE SITS DOWN
WHAT IS HE THINKING ABOUT DOES HE FEEL THE CHASTE CHARM NATURE WEARS
TO NIGHT A PEARL WHITE MOON SMILES THROUGH THE GRAY TREES DOES HE CARE
FOR HER SMILE
IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FOR HE IS SILENT AND HIS COUNTENANCE DOES NOT SPEAK
AS YET IT IS NO MIRROR TO REFLECT SENSATION BUT RATHER A MASK TO
CONCEAL IT
THIS BOY IS A STRIPLING OF FIFTEEN SLIGHT AND TALL OF HIS
YEARS
IN HIS FACE THERE IS AS LITTLE OF AMENITY AS OF SERVILITY HIS
EYE SEEMS PREPARED TO NOTE ANY INCIPIENT ATTEMPT TO CONTROL OR OVERREACH
HIM AND THE REST OF HIS FEATURES INDICATE FACULTIES ALERT FOR
RESISTANCE
WISE USHERS AVOID UNNECESSARY INTERFERENCE WITH THAT LAD
TO BREAK HIM IN BY SEVERITY WOULD BE A USELESS ATTEMPT TO WIN HIM BY
FLATTERY WOULD BE AN EFFORT WORSE THAN USELESS
HE IS BEST LET ALONE
TIME WILL EDUCATE AND EXPERIENCE TRAIN HIM
PROFESSEDLY MARTIN YORKE IT IS A YOUNG YORKE OF COURSE TRAMPLES ON
THE NAME OF POETRY
TALK SENTIMENT TO HIM AND YOU WOULD BE ANSWERED BY
SARCASM
HERE HE IS WANDERING ALONE WAITING DUTEOUSLY ON NATURE WHILE
SHE UNFOLDS A PAGE OF STERN OF SILENT AND OF SOLEMN POETRY BENEATH HIS
ATTENTIVE GAZE
BEING SEATED HE TAKES FROM HIS SATCHEL A BOOK NOT THE LATIN GRAMMAR
BUT A CONTRABAND VOLUME OF FAIRY TALES
THERE WILL BE LIGHT ENOUGH YET
FOR AN HOUR TO SERVE HIS KEEN YOUNG VISION
BESIDES THE MOON WAITS ON
HIM HER BEAM DIM AND VAGUE AS YET FILLS THE GLADE WHERE HE SITS
HE READS
HE IS LED INTO A SOLITARY MOUNTAIN REGION ALL ROUND HIM IS
RUDE AND DESOLATE SHAPELESS AND ALMOST COLOURLESS
HE HEARS BELLS
TINKLE ON THE WIND
FORTH RIDING FROM THE FORMLESS FOLDS OF THE MIST
DAWNS ON HIM THE BRIGHTEST VISION A GREEN ROBED LADY ON A SNOW WHITE
PALFREY
HE SEES HER DRESS HER GEMS AND HER STEED
SHE ARRESTS HIM
WITH SOME MYSTERIOUS QUESTION
HE IS SPELL BOUND AND MUST FOLLOW HER
INTO FAIRYLAND
A SECOND LEGEND BEARS HIM TO THE SEA SHORE
THERE TUMBLES IN A STRONG
TIDE BOILING AT THE BASE OF DIZZY CLIFFS
IT RAINS AND BLOWS
A REEF OF
ROCKS BLACK AND ROUGH STRETCHES FAR INTO THE SEA
ALL ALONG AND
AMONG AND ABOVE THESE CRAGS DASH AND FLASH SWEEP AND LEAP SWELLS
WREATHS DRIFTS OF SNOWY SPRAY
SOME LONE WANDERER IS OUT ON THESE
ROCKS TREADING WITH CAUTIOUS STEP THE WET WILD SEAWEED GLANCING DOWN
INTO HOLLOWS WHERE THE BRINE LIES FATHOMS DEEP AND EMERALD CLEAR AND
SEEING THERE WILDER AND STRANGER AND HUGER VEGETATION THAN IS FOUND ON
LAND WITH TREASURE OF SHELLS SOME GREEN SOME PURPLE SOME
PEARLY CLUSTERED IN THE CURLS OF THE SNAKY PLANTS
HE HEARS A CRY
LOOKING UP AND FORWARD HE SEES AT THE BLEAK POINT OF THE REEF A TALL
PALE THING SHAPED LIKE MAN BUT MADE OF SPRAY TRANSPARENT TREMULOUS
AWFUL
IT STANDS NOT ALONE
THEY ARE ALL HUMAN FIGURES THAT WANTON IN
THE ROCKS A CROWD OF FOAM WOMEN A BAND OF WHITE EVANESCENT NEREIDS
HUSH SHUT THE BOOK HIDE IT IN THE SATCHEL
MARTIN HEARS A TREAD
HE
LISTENS
NO YES
ONCE MORE THE DEAD LEAVES LIGHTLY CRUSHED RUSTLE ON
THE WOOD PATH
MARTIN WATCHES THE TREES PART AND A WOMAN ISSUES
FORTH
SHE IS A LADY DRESSED IN DARK SILK A VEIL COVERING HER FACE
MARTIN
NEVER MET A LADY IN THIS WOOD BEFORE NOR ANY FEMALE SAVE NOW AND
THEN A VILLAGE GIRL COME TO GATHER NUTS
TO NIGHT THE APPARITION DOES
NOT DISPLEASE HIM
HE OBSERVES AS SHE APPROACHES THAT SHE IS NEITHER
OLD NOR PLAIN BUT ON THE CONTRARY VERY YOUTHFUL AND BUT THAT HE NOW
RECOGNIZES HER FOR ONE WHOM HE HAS OFTEN WILFULLY PRONOUNCED UGLY HE
WOULD DEEM THAT HE DISCOVERED TRAITS OF BEAUTY BEHIND THE THIN GAUZE OF
THAT VEIL
SHE PASSES HIM AND SAYS NOTHING
HE KNEW SHE WOULD
ALL WOMEN ARE PROUD
MONKEYS AND HE KNOWS NO MORE CONCEITED DOLL THAN THAT CAROLINE
HELSTONE
THE THOUGHT IS HARDLY HATCHED IN HIS MIND WHEN THE LADY
RETRACES THOSE TWO STEPS SHE HAD GOT BEYOND HIM AND RAISING HER VEIL
REPOSES HER GLANCE ON HIS FACE WHILE SHE SOFTLY ASKS ARE YOU ONE OF
MR
YORKE'S SONS
NO HUMAN EVIDENCE WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PERSUADE MARTIN YORKE
THAT HE BLUSHED WHEN THUS ADDRESSED YET BLUSH HE DID TO THE EARS
I AM HE SAID BLUNTLY AND ENCOURAGED HIMSELF TO WONDER
SUPERCILIOUSLY WHAT WOULD COME NEXT
YOU ARE MARTIN I THINK WAS THE OBSERVATION THAT FOLLOWED
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FELICITOUS
IT WAS A SIMPLE SENTENCE VERY
ARTLESSLY A LITTLE TIMIDLY PRONOUNCED BUT IT CHIMED IN HARMONY TO THE
YOUTH'S NATURE
IT STILLED HIM LIKE A NOTE OF MUSIC
MARTIN HAD A KEEN SENSE OF HIS PERSONALITY HE FELT IT RIGHT AND
SENSIBLE THAT THE GIRL SHOULD DISCRIMINATE HIM FROM HIS BROTHERS
LIKE
HIS FATHER HE HATED CEREMONY
IT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO HEAR A LADY ADDRESS
HIM AS MARTIN AND NOT MR
MARTIN OR MASTER MARTIN WHICH FORM WOULD
HAVE LOST HER HIS GOOD GRACES FOR EVER
WORSE IF POSSIBLE THAN
CEREMONY WAS THE OTHER EXTREME OF SLIPSHOD FAMILIARITY
THE SLIGHT TONE
OF BASHFULNESS THE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE HESITATION WAS CONSIDERED
PERFECTLY IN PLACE
I AM MARTIN HE SAID
ARE YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER WELL IT WAS LUCKY SHE DID NOT SAY PAPA
AND MAMMA THAT WOULD HAVE UNDONE ALL AND ROSE AND JESSIE
I SUPPOSE SO
MY COUSIN HORTENSE IS STILL AT BRIARMAINS
OH YES
MARTIN GAVE A COMIC HALF SMILE AND DEMI GROAN
THE HALF SMILE WAS
RESPONDED TO BY THE LADY WHO COULD GUESS IN WHAT SORT OF ODOUR HORTENSE
WAS LIKELY TO BE HELD BY THE YOUNG YORKES
DOES YOUR MOTHER LIKE HER
THEY SUIT SO WELL ABOUT THE SERVANTS THEY CAN'T HELP LIKING EACH
OTHER
IT IS COLD TO NIGHT
WHY ARE YOU OUT SO LATE
I LOST MY WAY IN THIS WOOD
NOW INDEED MARTIN ALLOWED HIMSELF A REFRESHING LAUGH OF SCORN
LOST YOUR WAY IN THE MIGHTY FOREST OF BRIARMAINS YOU DESERVE NEVER
MORE TO FIND IT
I NEVER WAS HERE BEFORE AND I BELIEVE I AM TRESPASSING NOW
YOU MIGHT
INFORM AGAINST ME IF YOU CHOSE MARTIN AND HAVE ME FINED
IT IS YOUR
FATHER'S WOOD
I SHOULD THINK I KNEW THAT
BUT SINCE YOU ARE SO SIMPLE AS TO LOSE YOUR
WAY I WILL GUIDE YOU OUT
YOU NEED NOT
I HAVE GOT INTO THE TRACK NOW
I SHALL BE RIGHT
MARTIN
A LITTLE QUICKLY HOW IS MR
MOORE
MARTIN HAD HEARD CERTAIN RUMOURS IT STRUCK HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE AMUSING
TO MAKE AN EXPERIMENT
GOING TO DIE
NOTHING CAN SAVE HIM
ALL HOPE FLUNG OVERBOARD
SHE PUT HER VEIL ASIDE
SHE LOOKED INTO HIS EYES AND SAID TO DIE
TO DIE
ALL ALONG OF THE WOMEN MY MOTHER AND THE REST
THEY DID
SOMETHING ABOUT HIS BANDAGES THAT FINISHED EVERYTHING
HE WOULD HAVE GOT
BETTER BUT FOR THEM
I AM SURE THEY SHOULD BE ARRESTED CRIBBED TRIED
AND BROUGHT IN FOR BOTANY BAY AT THE VERY LEAST
THE QUESTIONER PERHAPS DID NOR HEAR THIS JUDGMENT
SHE STOOD
MOTIONLESS
IN TWO MINUTES WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD SHE MOVED FORWARDS NO
GOOD NIGHT NO FURTHER INQUIRY
THIS WAS NOT AMUSING NOR WHAT MARTIN
HAD CALCULATED ON
HE EXPECTED SOMETHING DRAMATIC AND DEMONSTRATIVE
IT
WAS HARDLY WORTH WHILE TO FRIGHTEN THE GIRL IF SHE WOULD NOT ENTERTAIN
HIM IN RETURN
HE CALLED MISS HELSTONE
SHE DID NOT HEAR OR TURN
HE HASTENED AFTER AND OVERTOOK HER
COME ARE YOU UNEASY ABOUT WHAT I SAID
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT DEATH MARTIN YOU ARE TOO YOUNG FOR ME TO TALK
TO CONCERNING SUCH A THING
DID YOU BELIEVE ME IT'S ALL FLUMMERY MOORE EATS LIKE THREE MEN
THEY
ARE ALWAYS MAKING SAGO OR TAPIOCA OR SOMETHING GOOD FOR HIM
I NEVER GO
INTO THE KITCHEN BUT THERE IS A SAUCEPAN ON THE FIRE COOKING HIM SOME
DAINTY
I THINK I WILL PLAY THE OLD SOLDIER AND BE FED ON THE FAT OF
THE LAND LIKE HIM
MARTIN MARTIN HERE HER VOICE TREMBLED AND SHE STOPPED
IT IS EXCEEDINGLY WRONG OF YOU MARTIN
YOU HAVE ALMOST KILLED ME
AGAIN SHE STOPPED
SHE LEANED AGAINST A TREE TREMBLING SHUDDERING AND
AS PALE AS DEATH
MARTIN CONTEMPLATED HER WITH INEXPRESSIBLE CURIOSITY
IN ONE SENSE IT
WAS AS HE WOULD HAVE EXPRESSED IT NUTS TO HIM TO SEE THIS
IT TOLD
HIM SO MUCH AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE A GREAT RELISH FOR DISCOVERING
SECRETS
IN ANOTHER SENSE IT REMINDED HIM OF WHAT HE HAD ONCE FELT WHEN
HE HAD HEARD A BLACKBIRD LAMENTING FOR HER NESTLINGS WHICH MATTHEW HAD
CRUSHED WITH A STONE AND THAT WAS NOT A PLEASANT FEELING
UNABLE TO
FIND ANYTHING VERY APPROPRIATE TO SAY IN ORDER TO COMFORT HER HE
BEGAN TO CAST ABOUT IN HIS MIND WHAT HE COULD DO
HE SMILED
THE LAD'S
SMILE GAVE WONDROUS TRANSPARENCY TO HIS PHYSIOGNOMY
EUREKA HE CRIED
I'LL SET ALL STRAIGHT BY AND BY
YOU ARE BETTER
NOW MISS CAROLINE
WALK FORWARD HE URGED
NOT REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR MISS HELSTONE THAN
FOR HIMSELF TO CLIMB A WALL OR PENETRATE A HEDGE HE PILOTED HER BY A
SHORT CUT WHICH LED TO NO GATE
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS HE HAD TO HELP HER
OVER SOME FORMIDABLE OBSTACLES AND WHILE HE RAILED AT HER FOR
HELPLESSNESS HE PERFECTLY LIKED TO FEEL HIMSELF OF USE
MARTIN BEFORE WE SEPARATE ASSURE ME SERIOUSLY AND ON YOUR WORD OF
HONOUR THAT MR
MOORE IS BETTER
HOW VERY MUCH YOU THINK OF THAT MOORE
NO BUT MANY OF HIS FRIENDS MAY ASK ME AND I WISH TO BE ABLE TO GIVE
AN AUTHENTIC ANSWER
YOU MAY TELL THEM HE IS WELL ENOUGH ONLY IDLE
YOU MAY TELL THEM THAT
HE TAKES MUTTON CHOPS FOR DINNER AND THE BEST OF ARROWROOT FOR SUPPER
I INTERCEPTED A BASIN MYSELF ONE NIGHT ON ITS WAY UPSTAIRS AND ATE HALF
OF IT
AND WHO WAITS ON HIM MARTIN WHO NURSES HIM
NURSES HIM THE GREAT BABY WHY A WOMAN AS ROUND AND BIG AS OUR
LARGEST WATER BUTT A ROUGH HARD FAVOURED OLD GIRL
I MAKE NO DOUBT
SHE LEADS HIM A RICH LIFE
NOBODY ELSE IS LET NEAR HIM
HE IS CHIEFLY IN
THE DARK
IT IS MY BELIEF SHE KNOCKS HIM ABOUT TERRIBLY IN THAT CHAMBER
I LISTEN AT THE WALL SOMETIMES WHEN I AM IN BED AND I THINK I HEAR HER
THUMPING HIM
YOU SHOULD SEE HER FIST
SHE COULD HOLD HALF A DOZEN HANDS
LIKE YOURS IN HER ONE PALM
AFTER ALL NOTWITHSTANDING THE CHOPS AND
JELLIES HE GETS I WOULD NOT BE IN HIS SHOES
IN FACT IT IS MY PRIVATE
OPINION THAT SHE EATS MOST OF WHAT GOES UP ON THE TRAY TO MR
MOORE
I
WISH SHE MAY NOT BE STARVING HIM
PROFOUND SILENCE AND MEDITATION ON CAROLINE'S PART AND A SLY
WATCHFULNESS ON MARTIN'S
YOU NEVER SEE HIM I SUPPOSE MARTIN
I NO
I DON'T CARE TO SEE HIM FOR MY OWN PART
SILENCE AGAIN
DID NOT YOU COME TO OUR HOUSE ONCE WITH MRS
PRYOR ABOUT FIVE WEEKS
SINCE TO ASK AFTER HIM AGAIN INQUIRED MARTIN
YES
I DARE SAY YOU WISHED TO BE SHOWN UPSTAIRS
WE DID WISH IT
WE ENTREATED IT BUT YOUR MOTHER DECLINED
AY SHE DECLINED
I HEARD IT ALL
SHE TREATED YOU AS IT IS HER PLEASURE
TO TREAT VISITORS NOW AND THEN
SHE BEHAVED TO YOU RUDELY AND HARSHLY
SHE WAS NOT KIND FOR YOU KNOW MARTIN WE ARE RELATIONS AND IT IS
NATURAL WE SHOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN MR
MOORE
BUT HERE WE MUST PART
WE ARE AT YOUR FATHER'S GATE
VERY WELL WHAT OF THAT I SHALL WALK HOME WITH YOU
THEY WILL MISS YOU AND WONDER WHERE YOU ARE
LET THEM
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I SUPPOSE
MARTIN KNEW THAT HE HAD ALREADY INCURRED THE PENALTY OF A LECTURE AND
DRY BREAD FOR HIS TEA
NO MATTER THE EVENING HAD FURNISHED HIM WITH AN
ADVENTURE
IT WAS BETTER THAN MUFFINS AND TOAST
HE WALKED HOME WITH CAROLINE
ON THE WAY HE PROMISED TO SEE MR
MOORE
IN SPITE OF THE DRAGON WHO GUARDED HIS CHAMBER AND APPOINTED AN HOUR ON
THE NEXT DAY WHEN CAROLINE WAS TO COME TO BRIARMAINS WOOD AND GET
TIDINGS OF HIM
HE WOULD MEET HER AT A CERTAIN TREE
THE SCHEME LED TO
NOTHING STILL HE LIKED IT
HAVING REACHED HOME THE DRY BREAD AND THE LECTURE WERE DULY
ADMINISTERED TO HIM AND HE WAS DISMISSED TO BED AT AN EARLY HOUR
HE
ACCEPTED HIS PUNISHMENT WITH THE TOUGHEST STOICISM
ERE ASCENDING TO HIS CHAMBER HE PAID A SECRET VISIT TO THE DINING ROOM
A STILL COLD STATELY APARTMENT SELDOM USED FOR THE FAMILY
CUSTOMARILY DINED IN THE BACK PARLOUR
HE STOOD BEFORE THE MANTELPIECE
AND LIFTED HIS CANDLE TO TWO PICTURES HUNG ABOVE FEMALE HEADS ONE A
TYPE OF SERENE BEAUTY HAPPY AND INNOCENT THE OTHER MORE LOVELY BUT
FORLORN AND DESPERATE
SHE LOOKED LIKE THAT HE SAID GAZING ON THE LATTER SKETCH WHEN
SHE SOBBED TURNED WHITE AND LEANED AGAINST THE TREE
I SUPPOSE HE PURSUED WHEN HE WAS IN HIS ROOM AND SEATED ON THE EDGE
OF HIS PALLET BED I SUPPOSE SHE IS WHAT THEY CALL IN LOVE YES
IN LOVE WITH THAT LONG THING IN THE NEXT CHAMBER
WHISHT IS THAT
HORSFALL CLATTERING HIM I WONDER HE DOES NOT YELL OUT
IT REALLY SOUNDS
AS IF SHE HAD FALLEN ON HIM TOOTH AND NAIL BUT I SUPPOSE SHE IS MAKING
THE BED
I SAW HER AT IT ONCE
SHE HIT INTO THE MATTRESSES AS IF SHE WAS
BOXING
IT IS QUEER ZILLAH THEY CALL HER ZILLAH ZILLAH HORSFALL IS A
WOMAN AND CAROLINE HELSTONE IS A WOMAN THEY ARE TWO INDIVIDUALS OF THE
SAME SPECIES NOT MUCH ALIKE THOUGH
IS SHE A PRETTY GIRL THAT
CAROLINE I SUSPECT SHE IS VERY NICE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING SO CLEAR IN
HER FACE SO SOFT IN HER EYES
I APPROVE OF HER LOOKING AT ME IT DOES
ME GOOD
SHE HAS LONG EYELASHES
THEIR SHADOW SEEMS TO REST WHERE SHE
GAZES AND TO INSTIL PEACE AND THOUGHT
IF SHE BEHAVES WELL AND
CONTINUES TO SUIT ME AS SHE HAS SUITED ME TO DAY I MAY DO HER A GOOD
TURN
I RATHER RELISH THE NOTION OF CIRCUMVENTING MY MOTHER AND THAT
OGRESS OLD HORSFALL
NOT THAT I LIKE HUMOURING MOORE BUT WHATEVER I DO
I'LL BE PAID FOR AND IN COIN OF MY OWN CHOOSING
I KNOW WHAT REWARD I
WILL CLAIM ONE DISPLEASING TO MOORE AND AGREEABLE TO MYSELF
HE TURNED INTO BED
CHAPTER XXXIII
MARTIN'S TACTICS
IT WAS NECESSARY TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF MARTIN'S PLAN THAT HE SHOULD STAY
AT HOME THAT DAY
ACCORDINGLY HE FOUND NO APPETITE FOR BREAKFAST AND
JUST ABOUT SCHOOL TIME TOOK A SEVERE PAIN ABOUT HIS HEART WHICH
RENDERED IT ADVISABLE THAT INSTEAD OF SETTING OUT TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL
WITH MARK HE SHOULD SUCCEED TO HIS FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRESIDE
AND ALSO TO HIS MORNING PAPER
THIS POINT BEING SATISFACTORILY SETTLED
AND MARK BEING GONE TO MR
SUMMER'S CLASS AND MATTHEW AND MR
YORKE
WITHDRAWN TO THE COUNTING HOUSE THREE OTHER EXPLOITS NAY
FOUR REMAINED TO BE ACHIEVED
THE FIRST OF THESE WAS TO REALIZE THE BREAKFAST HE HAD NOT YET TASTED
AND WITH WHICH HIS APPETITE OF FIFTEEN COULD ILL AFFORD TO DISPENSE THE
SECOND THIRD FOURTH TO GET HIS MOTHER MISS MOORE AND MRS
HORSFALL
SUCCESSFULLY OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE FOUR O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON
THE FIRST WAS FOR THE PRESENT THE MOST PRESSING SINCE THE WORK BEFORE
HIM DEMANDED AN AMOUNT OF ENERGY WHICH THE PRESENT EMPTY CONDITION OF
HIS YOUTHFUL STOMACH DID NOT SEEM LIKELY TO SUPPLY
MARTIN KNEW THE WAY TO THE LARDER AND KNOWING THIS WAY HE TOOK IT
THE
SERVANTS WERE IN THE KITCHEN BREAKFASTING SOLEMNLY WITH CLOSED DOORS
HIS MOTHER AND MISS MOORE WERE AIRING THEMSELVES ON THE LAWN AND
DISCUSSING THE CLOSED DOORS AFORESAID
MARTIN SAFE IN THE LARDER MADE
FASTIDIOUS SELECTION FROM ITS STORES
HIS BREAKFAST HAD BEEN DELAYED HE
WAS DETERMINED IT SHOULD BE RECHERCH
IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT A
VARIETY ON HIS USUAL SOMEWHAT INSIPID FARE OF BREAD AND MILK WAS BOTH
DESIRABLE AND ADVISABLE THE SAVOURY AND THE SALUTARY HE THOUGHT MIGHT
BE COMBINED
THERE WAS STORE OF ROSY APPLES LAID IN STRAW UPON A SHELF
HE PICKED OUT THREE
THERE WAS PASTRY UPON A DISH HE SELECTED AN
APRICOT PUFF AND A DAMSON TART
ON THE PLAIN HOUSEHOLD BREAD HIS EYE
DID NOT DWELL BUT HE SURVEYED WITH FAVOUR SOME CURRANT TEA CAKES AND
CONDESCENDED TO MAKE CHOICE OF ONE
THANKS TO HIS CLASP KNIFE HE WAS
ABLE TO APPROPRIATE A WING OF FOWL AND A SLICE OF HAM A CANTLET OF COLD
CUSTARD PUDDING HE THOUGHT WOULD HARMONIZE WITH THESE ARTICLES AND
HAVING MADE THIS FINAL ADDITION TO HIS BOOTY HE AT LENGTH SALLIED FORTH
INTO THE HALL
HE WAS ALREADY HALF WAY ACROSS THREE STEPS MORE WOULD HAVE ANCHORED HIM
IN THE HARBOUR OF THE BACK PARLOUR WHEN THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND
THERE STOOD MATTHEW
BETTER FAR HAD IT BEEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN FULL
EQUIPAGE OF HORNS HOOFS AND TAIL
MATTHEW SCEPTIC AND SCOFFER HAD ALREADY FAILED TO SUBSCRIBE A PROMPT
BELIEF IN THAT PAIN ABOUT THE HEART
HE HAD MUTTERED SOME WORDS AMONGST
WHICH THE PHRASE SHAMMING ABRAHAM HAD BEEN VERY DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE
AND THE SUCCESSION TO THE ARMCHAIR AND NEWSPAPER HAD APPEARED TO AFFECT
HIM WITH MENTAL SPASMS
THE SPECTACLE NOW BEFORE HIM THE APPLES THE
TARTS THE TEA CAKES THE FOWL HAM AND PUDDING OFFERED EVIDENCE BUT
TOO WELL CALCULATED TO INFLATE HIS OPINION OF HIS OWN SAGACITY
MARTIN PAUSED INTERDIT ONE MINUTE ONE INSTANT THE NEXT HE KNEW HIS
GROUND AND PRONOUNCED ALL WELL
WITH THE TRUE PERSPICACITY DES MES
LITES HE AT ONCE SAW HOW THIS AT FIRST SIGHT UNTOWARD EVENT MIGHT BE
TURNED TO EXCELLENT ACCOUNT
HE SAW HOW IT MIGHT BE SO HANDLED AS TO
SECURE THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS SECOND TASK NAMELY THE DISPOSAL OF
HIS MOTHER
HE KNEW THAT A COLLISION BETWEEN HIM AND MATTHEW ALWAYS
SUGGESTED TO MRS
YORKE THE PROPRIETY OF A FIT OF HYSTERICS
HE FURTHER
KNEW THAT ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CALM SUCCEEDING TO STORM AFTER A MORNING
OF HYSTERICS HIS MOTHER WAS SURE TO INDULGE IN AN AFTERNOON OF BED
THIS
WOULD ACCOMMODATE HIM PERFECTLY
THE COLLISION DULY TOOK PLACE IN THE HALL
A DRY LAUGH AN INSULTING
SNEER A CONTEMPTUOUS TAUNT MET BY A NONCHALANT BUT MOST CUTTING REPLY
WERE THE SIGNALS
THEY RUSHED AT IT
MARTIN WHO USUALLY MADE LITTLE
NOISE ON THESE OCCASIONS MADE A GREAT DEAL NOW
IN FLEW THE SERVANTS
MRS
YORKE MISS MOORE
NO FEMALE HAND COULD SEPARATE THEM
MR
YORKE
WAS SUMMONED
SONS SAID HE ONE OF YOU MUST LEAVE MY ROOF IF THIS OCCURS AGAIN
I
WILL HAVE NO CAIN AND ABEL STRIFE HERE
MARTIN NOW ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE TAKEN OFF
HE HAD BEEN HURT HE WAS THE
YOUNGEST AND SLIGHTEST
HE WAS QUITE COOL IN NO PASSION HE EVEN
SMILED CONTENT THAT THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE LABOUR HE HAD SET
HIMSELF WAS OVER
ONCE HE SEEMED TO FLAG IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING
IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO BOTHER MYSELF FOR THAT CAROLINE HE REMARKED
BUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE WAS AGAIN IN THE DINING ROOM
LOOKING AT THE HEAD WITH DISHEVELLED TRESSES AND EYES TURBID WITH
DESPAIR
YES HE SAID I MADE HER SOB SHUDDER ALMOST FAINT
I'LL SEE HER
SMILE BEFORE I'VE DONE WITH HER BESIDES I WANT TO OUTWIT ALL THESE
WOMENITES
DIRECTLY AFTER DINNER MRS
YORKE FULFILLED HER SON'S CALCULATION BY
WITHDRAWING TO HER CHAMBER
NOW FOR HORTENSE
THAT LADY WAS JUST COMFORTABLY SETTLED TO STOCKING MENDING IN THE BACK
PARLOUR WHEN MARTIN LAYING DOWN A BOOK WHICH STRETCHED ON THE SOFA
HE WAS STILL INDISPOSED ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE HAD BEEN
PERUSING IN ALL THE VOLUPTUOUS EASE OF A YET CALLOW PACHA LAZILY
INTRODUCED SOME DISCOURSE ABOUT SARAH THE MAID AT THE HOLLOW
IN THE
COURSE OF MUCH VERBAL MEANDERING HE INSINUATED INFORMATION THAT THIS
DAMSEL WAS SAID TO HAVE THREE SUITORS FREDERIC MURGATROYD JEREMIAH
PIGHILLS AND JOHN OF MALLY'S OF HANNAH'S OF DEB'S AND THAT MISS MANN
HAD AFFIRMED SHE KNEW FOR A FACT THAT NOW THE GIRL WAS LEFT IN SOLE
CHARGE OF THE COTTAGE SHE OFTEN HAD HER SWAINS TO MEALS AND
ENTERTAINED THEM WITH THE BEST THE HOUSE AFFORDED
IT NEEDED NO MORE
HORTENSE COULD NOT HAVE LIVED ANOTHER HOUR WITHOUT
BETAKING HERSELF TO THE SCENE OF THESE NEFARIOUS TRANSACTIONS AND
INSPECTING THE STATE OF MATTERS IN PERSON
MRS
HORSFALL REMAINED
MARTIN MASTER OF THE FIELD NOW EXTRACTED FROM HIS MOTHER'S WORK BASKET
A BUNCH OF KEYS WITH THESE HE OPENED THE SIDEBOARD CUPBOARD PRODUCED
THENCE A BLACK BOTTLE AND A SMALL GLASS PLACED THEM ON THE TABLE
NIMBLY MOUNTED THE STAIRS MADE FOR MR
MOORE'S DOOR TAPPED THE NURSE
OPENED
IF YOU PLEASE MA'AM YOU ARE INVITED TO STEP INTO THE BACK PARLOUR AND
TAKE SOME REFRESHMENT
YOU WILL NOT BE DISTURBED THE FAMILY ARE OUT
HE WATCHED HER DOWN HE WATCHED HER IN HIMSELF SHUT THE DOOR
HE KNEW
SHE WAS SAFE
THE HARD WORK WAS DONE NOW FOR THE PLEASURE
HE SNATCHED HIS CAP AND
AWAY FOR THE WOOD
IT WAS YET BUT HALF PAST THREE
IT HAD BEEN A FINE MORNING BUT THE SKY
LOOKED DARK NOW
IT WAS BEGINNING TO SNOW THE WIND BLEW COLD THE WOOD
LOOKED DISMAL THE OLD TREE GRIM
YET MARTIN APPROVED THE SHADOW ON HIS
PATH
HE FOUND A CHARM IN THE SPECTRAL ASPECT OF THE DODDERED OAK
HE HAD TO WAIT
TO AND FRO HE WALKED WHILE THE FLAKES FELL FASTER AND
THE WIND WHICH AT FIRST HAD BUT MOANED PITIFULLY HOWLED
SHE IS LONG IN COMING HE MUTTERED AS HE GLANCED ALONG THE NARROW
TRACK
I WONDER HE SUBJOINED WHAT I WISH TO SEE HER SO MUCH FOR
SHE IS NOT COMING FOR ME
BUT I HAVE POWER OVER HER AND I WANT HER TO
COME THAT I MAY USE THAT POWER
HE CONTINUED HIS WALK
NOW HE RESUMED WHEN A FURTHER PERIOD HAD ELAPSED IF SHE FAILS TO
COME I SHALL HATE AND SCORN HER
IT STRUCK FOUR
HE HEARD THE CHURCH CLOCK FAR AWAY
A STEP SO QUICK SO
LIGHT THAT BUT FOR THE RUSTLING OF LEAVES IT WOULD SCARCELY HAVE
SOUNDED ON THE WOOD WALK CHECKED HIS IMPATIENCE
THE WIND BLEW FIERCELY
NOW AND THE THICKENING WHITE STORM WAXED BEWILDERING BUT ON SHE CAME
AND NOT DISMAYED
WELL MARTIN SHE SAID EAGERLY HOW IS HE
IT IS QUEER HOW SHE THINKS OF HIM REFLECTED MARTIN
THE BLINDING
SNOW AND BITTER COLD ARE NOTHING TO HER I BELIEVE YET SHE IS BUT A
'CHITTY FACED CREATURE AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY
I COULD FIND IN MY
HEART TO WISH I HAD A CLOAK TO WRAP HER IN
THUS MEDITATING TO HIMSELF HE NEGLECTED TO ANSWER MISS HELSTONE
YOU HAVE SEEN HIM
NO
OH YOU PROMISED YOU WOULD
I MEAN TO DO BETTER BY YOU THAN THAT
DIDN'T I SAY I DON'T CARE TO
SEE HIM
BUT NOW IT WILL BE SO LONG BEFORE I GET TO KNOW ANY THING CERTAIN ABOUT
HIM AND I AM SICK OF WAITING
MARTIN DO SEE HIM AND GIVE HIM
CAROLINE HELSTONE'S REGARDS AND SAY SHE WISHED TO KNOW HOW HE WAS AND
IF ANYTHING COULD BE DONE FOR HIS COMFORT
I WON'T
YOU ARE CHANGED
YOU WERE SO FRIENDLY LAST NIGHT
COME WE MUST NOT STAND IN THIS WOOD IT IS TOO COLD
BUT BEFORE I GO PROMISE ME TO COME AGAIN TO MORROW WITH NEWS
NO SUCH THING
I AM MUCH TOO DELICATE TO MAKE AND KEEP SUCH
APPOINTMENTS IN THE WINTER SEASON
IF YOU KNEW WHAT A PAIN I HAD IN MY
CHEST THIS MORNING AND HOW I WENT WITHOUT BREAKFAST AND WAS KNOCKED
DOWN BESIDES YOU'D FEEL THE IMPROPRIETY OF BRINGING ME HERE IN THE
SNOW
COME I SAY
ARE YOU REALLY DELICATE MARTIN
DON'T I LOOK SO
YOU HAVE ROSY CHEEKS
THAT'S HECTIC
WILL YOU COME OR YOU WON'T
WHERE
WITH ME
I WAS A FOOL NOT TO BRING A CLOAK
I WOULD HAVE MADE YOU
COSY
YOU ARE GOING HOME MY NEAREST ROAD LIES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
PUT YOUR ARM THROUGH MINE I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU
BUT THE WALL THE HEDGE IT IS SUCH HARD WORK CLIMBING AND YOU ARE TOO
SLENDER AND YOUNG TO HELP ME WITHOUT HURTING YOURSELF
YOU SHALL GO THROUGH THE GATE
BUT
BUT BUT WILL YOU TRUST ME OR NOT
SHE LOOKED INTO HIS FACE
I THINK I WILL
ANYTHING RATHER THAN RETURN AS ANXIOUS AS I CAME
I CAN'T ANSWER FOR THAT
THIS HOWEVER I PROMISE YOU BE RULED BY ME
AND YOU SHALL SEE MOORE YOURSELF
SEE HIM MYSELF
YOURSELF
BUT DEAR MARTIN DOES HE KNOW
AH I'M DEAR NOW

CAROLINE FELL INTO A LONG SILENT FIT OF MUSING BUT STILL SHE WALKED ON
WITH HER GUIDE
THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF BRIARMAINS
HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND HE ASKED
SHE WAS SILENT
DECIDE WE ARE JUST ON THE SPOT
I WON'T SEE HIM THAT I TELL
YOU EXCEPT TO ANNOUNCE YOUR ARRIVAL
MARTIN YOU ARE A STRANGE BOY AND THIS IS A STRANGE STEP BUT ALL I
FEEL IS AND HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME STRANGE
I WILL SEE HIM
HAVING SAID THAT YOU WILL NEITHER HESITATE NOR RETRACT

HERE WE ARE THEN
DO NOT BE AFRAID OF PASSING THE PARLOUR WINDOW NO

HE LEFT HIS SHOES ON THE MAT MOUNTED THE STAIR UNSHOD
CAROLINE STOLE
AFTER WITH NOISELESS STEP
THERE WAS A GALLERY AND THERE WAS A
PASSAGE AT THE END OF THAT PASSAGE MARTIN PAUSED BEFORE A DOOR AND
TAPPED
HE HAD TO TAP TWICE THRICE
A VOICE KNOWN TO ONE LISTENER AT
LAST SAID COME IN
THE BOY ENTERED BRISKLY
MR
MOORE A LADY CALLED TO INQUIRE AFTER YOU
NONE OF THE WOMEN WERE
ABOUT

MORE LIKE ME THAN YOU FOR SHE IS YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL
YOU ARE TO SHOW HER FORWARD

CHAMBER BY A TALL THIN WASTED FIGURE WHO TOOK BOTH HER HANDS
I GIVE YOU A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAID MARTIN AS HE WITHDREW NO
MORE
SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY IN THAT TIME
TILL IT IS PAST I WILL WAIT
IN THE GALLERY NOTHING SHALL APPROACH I'LL SEE YOU SAFE AWAY
SHOULD

HE SHUT THE DOOR
IN THE GALLERY HE WAS AS ELATE AS A KING
HE HAD NEVER
BEEN ENGAGED IN AN ADVENTURE HE LIKED SO WELL FOR NO ADVENTURE HAD EVER
INVESTED HIM WITH SO MUCH IMPORTANCE OR INSPIRED HIM WITH SO MUCH
INTEREST
YOU ARE COME AT LAST SAID THE MEAGRE MAN GAZING ON HIS VISITRESS

FOR A MONTH NEAR TWO MONTHS WE HAVE BEEN VERY NEAR AND I HAVE BEEN
IN SAD PAIN AND DANGER AND MISERY CARY
I COULD NOT COME
COULDN'T YOU BUT THE RECTORY AND BRIARMAINS ARE VERY NEAR NOT TWO
MILES APART
THERE WAS PAIN AND THERE WAS PLEASURE IN THE GIRL'S FACE AS SHE LISTENED
TO THESE IMPLIED REPROACHES
IT WAS SWEET IT WAS BITTER TO DEFEND
HERSELF
WHEN I SAY I COULD NOT COME I MEAN I COULD NOT SEE YOU FOR I CAME
WITH MAMMA THE VERY DAY WE HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED
MR
MACTURK THEN
TOLD US IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMIT ANY STRANGER
BUT AFTERWARDS EVERY FINE AFTERNOON THESE MANY WEEKS PAST I HAVE
WAITED AND LISTENED
SOMETHING HERE CARY LAYING HIS HAND ON HIS
BREAST TOLD ME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME
NOT
THAT I MERIT THOUGHT BUT WE ARE OLD ACQUAINTANCE WE ARE COUSINS
I CAME AGAIN ROBERT MAMMA AND I CAME AGAIN
DID YOU COME THAT IS WORTH HEARING
SINCE YOU CAME AGAIN WE WILL SIT
DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT
THEY SAT DOWN
CAROLINE DREW HER CHAIR UP TO HIS
THE AIR WAS NOW DARK

SHIRLEY LAUGHED AT LAST I CRIED MAMMA WAS
SERIOUSLY ANNOYED

SATISFACTION OF LOOKING UP AT YOUR WINDOW WHICH I COULD DISTINGUISH BY
THE DRAWN CURTAINS
I REALLY DARED NOT COME IN
I HAVE WISHED FOR YOU CAROLINE
I DID NOT KNOW THAT I NEVER DREAMT ONE INSTANT THAT YOU THOUGHT OF ME
IF I HAD BUT MOST DISTANTLY IMAGINED SUCH A POSSIBILITY
MRS
YORKE WOULD STILL HAVE BEATEN YOU
SHE WOULD NOT
STRATAGEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRIED IF PERSUASION FAILED
I WOULD HAVE COME TO THE KITCHEN DOOR THE SERVANTS SHOULD HAVE LET ME
IN AND I WOULD HAVE WALKED STRAIGHT UPSTAIRS
IN FACT IT WAS FAR MORE
THE FEAR OF INTRUSION THE FEAR OF YOURSELF THAT BAFFLED ME THAN THE
FEAR OF MRS
YORKE
ONLY LAST NIGHT I DESPAIRED OF EVER SEEING YOU AGAIN
WEAKNESS HAS
WROUGHT TERRIBLE DEPRESSION IN ME TERRIBLE DEPRESSION
AND YOU SIT ALONE
WORSE THAN ALONE
BUT YOU MUST BE GETTING BETTER SINCE YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR BED

STRANGE FEELINGS

POWER TO COPE WITH SUCH A TOPIC

LET HER ONLY CATCH YOU ON THE STAIRS MISS CAROLINE
YOU'RE NOT
TO BID HIM GOOD BYE STEPPING BETWEEN HER AND MOORE YOU ARE TO
MARCH
MY SHAWL MARTIN
I HAVE IT
I'LL PUT IT ON FOR YOU WHEN YOU ARE IN THE HALL
HE MADE THEM PART
HE WOULD SUFFER NO FAREWELL BUT WHAT COULD BE
EXPRESSED IN LOOKS
HE HALF CARRIED CAROLINE DOWN THE STAIRS
IN THE
HALL HE WRAPPED HER SHAWL ROUND HER AND BUT THAT HIS MOTHER'S TREAD
THEN CREAKED IN THE GALLERY AND BUT THAT A SENTIMENT OF DIFFIDENCE THE
PROPER NATURAL THEREFORE THE NOBLE IMPULSE OF HIS BOY'S HEART HELD
HIM BACK HE WOULD HAVE CLAIMED HIS REWARD HE WOULD HAVE SAID NOW
MISS CAROLINE FOR ALL THIS GIVE ME ONE KISS BUT ERE THE WORDS HAD
PASSED HIS LIPS SHE WAS ACROSS THE SNOWY ROAD RATHER SKIMMING THAN
WADING THE DRIFTS
SHE IS MY DEBTOR AND I WILL BE PAID
HE FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT IT WAS OPPORTUNITY NOT AUDACITY WHICH HAD
FAILED HIM
HE MISJUDGED THE QUALITY OF HIS OWN NATURE AND HELD IT FOR
SOMETHING LOWER THAN IT WAS
CHAPTER XXXIV
CASE OF DOMESTIC PERSECUTION REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF PIOUS PERSEVERANCE
IN THE DISCHARGE OF RELIGIOUS DUTIES
MARTIN HAVING KNOWN THE TASTE OF EXCITEMENT WANTED A SECOND DRAUGHT
HAVING FELT THE DIGNITY OF POWER HE LOATHED TO RELINQUISH IT
MISS
HELSTONE THAT GIRL HE HAD ALWAYS CALLED UGLY AND WHOSE FACE WAS NOW
PERPETUALLY BEFORE HIS EYES BY DAY AND BY NIGHT IN DARK AND IN
SUNSHINE HAD ONCE COME WITHIN HIS SPHERE
IT FRETTED HIM TO THINK THE
VISIT MIGHT NEVER BE REPEATED
THOUGH A SCHOOLBOY HE WAS NO ORDINARY SCHOOLBOY HE WAS DESTINED TO GROW
UP AN ORIGINAL
AT A FEW YEARS' LATER DATE HE TOOK GREAT PAINS TO PARE
AND POLISH HIMSELF DOWN TO THE PATTERN OF THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT HE
NEVER SUCCEEDED AN UNIQUE STAMP MARKED HIM ALWAYS
HE NOW SAT IDLE AT
HIS DESK IN THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL CASTING ABOUT IN HIS MIND FOR THE MEANS
OF ADDING ANOTHER CHAPTER TO HIS COMMENCED ROMANCE
HE DID NOT YET KNOW
HOW MANY COMMENCED LIFE ROMANCES ARE DOOMED NEVER TO GET BEYOND THE
FIRST OR AT MOST THE SECOND CHAPTER
HIS SATURDAY HALF HOLIDAY HE SPENT
IN THE WOOD WITH HIS BOOK OF FAIRY LEGENDS AND THAT OTHER UNWRITTEN
BOOK OF HIS IMAGINATION
MARTIN HARBOURED AN IRRELIGIOUS RELUCTANCE TO SEE THE APPROACH OF
SUNDAY
HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WHILE DISCLAIMING COMMUNITY WITH THE
ESTABLISHMENT FAILED NOT DULY ONCE ON THE SACRED DAY TO FILL THEIR
LARGE PEW IN BRIARFIELD CHURCH WITH THE WHOLE OF THEIR BLOOMING FAMILY
THEORETICALLY MR
YORKE PLACED ALL SECTS AND CHURCHES ON A LEVEL
MRS
YORKE AWARDED THE PALM TO MORAVIANS AND QUAKERS ON ACCOUNT OF THAT
CROWN OF HUMILITY BY THESE WORTHIES WORN
NEITHER OF THEM WERE EVER
KNOWN HOWEVER TO SET FOOT IN A CONVENTICLE
MARTIN I SAY DISLIKED SUNDAY BECAUSE THE MORNING SERVICE WAS LONG
AND THE SERMON USUALLY LITTLE TO HIS TASTE
THIS SATURDAY AFTERNOON
HOWEVER HIS WOODLAND MUSINGS DISCLOSED TO HIM A NEW FOUND CHARM IN THE
COMING DAY
IT PROVED A DAY OF DEEP SNOW SO DEEP THAT MRS
YORKE DURING BREAKFAST
ANNOUNCED HER CONVICTION THAT THE CHILDREN BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS WOULD
BE BETTER AT HOME AND HER DECISION THAT INSTEAD OF GOING TO CHURCH
THEY SHOULD SIT SILENT FOR TWO HOURS IN THE BACK PARLOUR WHILE ROSE AND
MARTIN ALTERNATELY READ A SUCCESSION OF SERMONS JOHN WESLEY'S
SERMONS JOHN WESLEY BEING A REFORMER AND AN AGITATOR HAD A PLACE
BOTH IN HER OWN AND HER HUSBAND'S FAVOUR
ROSE WILL DO AS SHE PLEASES SAID MARTIN NOT LOOKING UP FROM THE BOOK
WHICH ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM THEN AND IN AFTER LIFE HE WAS STUDYING
OVER HIS BREAD AND MILK
ROSE WILL DO AS SHE IS TOLD AND MARTIN TOO OBSERVED THE MOTHER
I AM GOING TO CHURCH
SO HER SON REPLIED WITH THE INEFFABLE QUIETUDE OF A TRUE YORKE WHO
KNOWS HIS WILL AND MEANS TO HAVE IT AND WHO IF PUSHED TO THE WALL
WILL LET HIMSELF BE CRUSHED TO DEATH PROVIDED NO WAY OF ESCAPE CAN BE
FOUND BUT WILL NEVER CAPITULATE
IT IS NOT FIT WEATHER SAID THE FATHER
NO ANSWER
THE YOUTH READ STUDIOUSLY HE SLOWLY BROKE HIS BREAD AND
SIPPED HIS MILK
MARTIN HATES TO GO TO CHURCH BUT HE HATES STILL MORE TO OBEY SAID
MRS
YORKE
I SUPPOSE I AM INFLUENCED BY PURE PERVERSENESS
YES YOU ARE
MOTHER I AM NOT
BY WHAT THEN ARE YOU INFLUENCED
BY A COMPLICATION OF MOTIVES THE INTRICACIES OF WHICH I SHOULD AS SOON
THINK OF EXPLAINING TO YOU AS I SHOULD OF TURNING MYSELF INSIDE OUT TO
EXHIBIT THE INTERNAL MACHINERY OF MY FRAME
HEAR MARTIN HEAR HIM CRIED MR
YORKE
I MUST SEE AND HAVE THIS LAD
OF MINE BROUGHT UP TO THE BAR
NATURE MEANT HIM TO LIVE BY HIS TONGUE
HESTHER YOUR THIRD SON MUST CERTAINLY BE A LAWYER HE HAS THE
STOCK IN TRADE BRASS SELF CONCEIT AND WORDS WORDS WORDS
SOME BREAD ROSE IF YOU PLEASE REQUESTED MARTIN WITH INTENSE
GRAVITY SERENITY PHLEGM
THE BOY HAD NATURALLY A LOW PLAINTIVE VOICE
WHICH IN HIS DOUR MOODS ROSE SCARCELY ABOVE A LADY'S WHISPER
THE MORE
INFLEXIBLY STUBBORN THE HUMOUR THE SOFTER THE SADDER THE TONE
HE
RANG THE BELL AND GENTLY ASKED FOR HIS WALKING SHOES
BUT MARTIN URGED HIS SIRE THERE IS DRIFT ALL THE WAY A MAN COULD
HARDLY WADE THROUGH IT
HOWEVER LAD HE CONTINUED SEEING THAT THE BOY
ROSE AS THE CHURCH BELL BEGAN TO TOLL THIS IS A CASE WHEREIN I WOULD
BY NO MEANS BALK THE OBDURATE CHAP OF HIS WILL
GO TO CHURCH BY ALL
MEANS
THERE IS A PITILESS WIND AND A SHARP FROZEN SLEET BESIDES THE
DEPTH UNDER FOOT
GO OUT INTO IT SINCE THOU PREFERS IT TO A WARM
FIRESIDE
MARTIN QUIETLY ASSUMED HIS CLOAK COMFORTER AND CAP AND DELIBERATELY
WENT OUT
MY FATHER HAS MORE SENSE THAN MY MOTHER HE PRONOUNCED
HOW WOMEN
MISS IT THEY DRIVE THE NAIL INTO THE FLESH THINKING THEY ARE HAMMERING
AWAY AT INSENSATE STONE
HE REACHED CHURCH EARLY
NOW IF THE WEATHER FRIGHTENS HER AND IT IS A REAL DECEMBER TEMPEST
OR IF THAT MRS
PRYOR OBJECTS TO HER GOING OUT AND I SHOULD MISS HER
AFTER ALL IT WILL VEX ME BUT TEMPEST OR TORNADO HAIL OR ICE SHE
OUGHT TO COME AND IF SHE HAS A MIND WORTHY OF HER EYES AND FEATURES
SHE WILL COME
SHE WILL BE HERE FOR THE CHANCE OF SEEING ME AS I AM
HERE FOR THE CHANCE OF SEEING HER
SHE WILL WANT TO GET A WORD
RESPECTING HER CONFOUNDED SWEETHEART AS I WANT TO GET ANOTHER FLAVOUR
OF WHAT I THINK THE ESSENCE OF LIFE A TASTE OF EXISTENCE WITH THE
SPIRIT PRESERVED IN IT AND NOT EVAPORATED
ADVENTURE IS TO STAGNATION
WHAT CHAMPAGNE IS TO FLAT PORTER
HE LOOKED ROUND
THE CHURCH WAS COLD SILENT EMPTY BUT FOR ONE OLD
WOMAN
AS THE CHIMES SUBSIDED AND THE SINGLE BELL TOLLED SLOWLY ANOTHER
AND ANOTHER ELDERLY PARISHIONER CAME DROPPING IN AND TOOK A HUMBLE
STATION IN THE FREE SITTINGS
IT IS ALWAYS THE FRAILEST THE OLDEST AND
THE POOREST THAT BRAVE THE WORST WEATHER TO PROVE AND MAINTAIN THEIR
CONSTANCY TO DEAR OLD MOTHER CHURCH
THIS WILD MORNING NOT ONE AFFLUENT
FAMILY ATTENDED NOT ONE CARRIAGE PARTY APPEARED ALL THE LINED AND
CUSHIONED PEWS WERE EMPTY ONLY ON THE BARE OAKEN SEATS SAT RANGED THE
GRAY HAIRED ELDERS AND FEEBLE PAUPERS
I'LL SCORN HER IF SHE DOESN'T COME MUTTERED MARTIN SHORTLY AND
SAVAGELY TO HIMSELF
THE RECTOR'S SHOVEL HAT HAD PASSED THE PORCH
MR
HELSTONE AND HIS CLERK WERE IN THE VESTRY
THE BELLS CEASED THE READING DESK WAS FILLED THE DOORS WERE
CLOSED THE SERVICE COMMENCED
VOID STOOD THE RECTORY PEW SHE WAS NOT
THERE
MARTIN SCORNED HER
WORTHLESS THING VAPID THING COMMONPLACE HUMBUG LIKE ALL OTHER
GIRLS WEAKLY SELFISH SHALLOW
SUCH WAS MARTIN'S LITURGY
SHE IS NOT LIKE OUR PICTURE
HER EYES ARE NOT LARGE AND EXPRESSIVE HER
NOSE IS NOT STRAIGHT DELICATE HELLENIC HER MOUTH HAS NOT THAT CHARM I
THOUGHT IT HAD WHICH I IMAGINED COULD BEGUILE ME OF SULLENNESS IN MY
WORST MOODS
WHAT IS SHE A THREAD PAPER A DOLL A TOY A GIRL IN
SHORT
SO ABSORBED WAS THE YOUNG CYNIC HE FORGOT TO RISE FROM HIS KNEES AT THE
PROPER PLACE AND WAS STILL IN AN EXEMPLARY ATTITUDE OF DEVOTION WHEN
THE LITANY OVER THE FIRST HYMN WAS GIVEN OUT
TO BE SO CAUGHT DID NOT
CONTRIBUTE TO SOOTHE HIM
HE STARTED UP RED FOR HE WAS AS SENSITIVE TO
RIDICULE AS ANY GIRL
TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE THE CHURCH DOOR HAD
REOPENED AND THE AISLES WERE FILLING PATTER PATTER PATTER A HUNDRED
LITTLE FEET TROTTED IN
IT WAS THE SUNDAY SCHOLARS
ACCORDING TO
BRIARFIELD WINTER CUSTOM THESE CHILDREN HAD TILL NOW BEEN KEPT WHERE
THERE WAS A WARM STOVE AND ONLY LED INTO CHURCH JUST BEFORE THE
COMMUNION AND SERMON
THE LITTLE ONES WERE SETTLED FIRST AND AT LAST WHEN THE BOYS AND THE
YOUNGER GIRLS WERE ALL ARRANGED WHEN THE ORGAN WAS SWELLING HIGH AND
THE CHOIR AND CONGREGATION WERE RISING TO UPLIFT A SPIRITUAL SONG A
TALL CLASS OF YOUNG WOMEN CAME QUIETLY IN CLOSING THE PROCESSION
THEIR
TEACHER HAVING SEEN THEM SEATED PASSED INTO THE RECTORY PEW
THE
FRENCH GRAY CLOAK AND SMALL BEAVER BONNET WERE KNOWN TO MARTIN IT WAS
THE VERY COSTUME HIS EYES HAD ACHED TO CATCH
MISS HELSTONE HAD NOT
SUFFERED THE STORM TO PROVE AN IMPEDIMENT
AFTER ALL SHE WAS COME TO
CHURCH
MARTIN PROBABLY WHISPERED HIS SATISFACTION TO HIS HYMN BOOK AT
ANY RATE HE THEREWITH HID HIS FACE TWO MINUTES
SATISFIED OR NOT HE HAD TIME TO GET VERY ANGRY WITH HER AGAIN BEFORE
THE SERMON WAS OVER
SHE HAD NEVER ONCE LOOKED HIS WAY AT LEAST HE HAD
NOT BEEN SO LUCKY AS TO ENCOUNTER A GLANCE
IF HE SAID IF SHE TAKES NO NOTICE OF ME IF SHE SHOWS I AM NOT IN
HER THOUGHTS I SHALL HAVE A WORSE A MEANER OPINION OF HER THAN EVER
MOST DESPICABLE WOULD IT BE TO COME FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE SHEEP FACED
SUNDAY SCHOLARS AND NOT FOR MY SAKE OR THAT LONG SKELETON MOORE'S
THE SERMON FOUND AN END THE BENEDICTION WAS PRONOUNCED THE
CONGREGATION DISPERSED
SHE HAD NOT BEEN NEAR HIM
NOW INDEED AS MARTIN SET HIS FACE HOMEWARD HE FELT THAT THE SLEET WAS
SHARP AND THE EAST WIND COLD
HIS NEAREST WAY LAY THROUGH SOME FIELDS
IT WAS A DANGEROUS BECAUSE AN
UNTRODDEN WAY
HE DID NOT CARE HE WOULD TAKE IT
NEAR THE SECOND STILE
ROSE A CLUMP OF TREES
WAS THAT AN UMBRELLA WAITING THERE YES AN
UMBRELLA HELD WITH EVIDENT DIFFICULTY AGAINST THE BLAST BEHIND IT
FLUTTERED A FRENCH GRAY CLOAK
MARTIN GRINNED AS HE TOILED UP THE STEEP
ENCUMBERED FIELD DIFFICULT TO THE FOOT AS A SLOPE IN THE UPPER REALMS
OF ETNA
THERE WAS AN INIMITABLE LOOK IN HIS FACE WHEN HAVING GAINED
THE STILE HE SEATED HIMSELF COOLLY THEREUPON AND THUS OPENED A
CONFERENCE WHICH FOR HIS OWN PART HE WAS WILLING TO PROLONG
INDEFINITELY
I THINK YOU HAD BETTER STRIKE A BARGAIN
EXCHANGE ME FOR MRS
PRYOR
I WAS NOT SURE WHETHER YOU WOULD COME THIS WAY MARTIN BUT I THOUGHT I
WOULD RUN THE CHANCE
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS GETTING A QUIET WORD
SPOKEN IN THE CHURCH OR CHURCHYARD
WILL YOU AGREE MAKE OVER MRS
PRYOR TO MY MOTHER AND PUT ME IN HER
SKIRTS
AS IF I COULD UNDERSTAND YOU WHAT PUTS MRS
PRYOR INTO YOUR HEAD
YOU CALL HER 'MAMMA DON'T YOU
SHE IS MY MAMMA
NOT POSSIBLE OR SO INEFFICIENT SO CARELESS A MAMMA I SHOULD MAKE A
FIVE TIMES BETTER ONE
YOU MAY LAUGH
I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO SEE YOU
LAUGH
YOUR TEETH I HATE UGLY TEETH BUT YOURS ARE AS PRETTY AS A PEARL
NECKLACE AND A NECKLACE OF WHICH THE PEARLS ARE VERY FAIR EVEN AND
WELL MATCHED TOO
MARTIN WHAT NOW I THOUGHT THE YORKES NEVER PAID COMPLIMENTS
THEY HAVE NOT DONE TILL THIS GENERATION BUT I FEEL AS IF IT WERE MY
VOCATION TO TURN OUT A NEW VARIETY OF THE YORKE SPECIES
I AM RATHER
TIRED OF MY OWN ANCESTORS
WE HAVE TRADITIONS GOING BACK FOR FOUR
AGES TALES OF HIRAM WHICH WAS THE SON OF HIRAM WHICH WAS THE SON OF
SAMUEL WHICH WAS THE SON OF JOHN WHICH WAS THE SON OF ZERUBBABEL
YORKE
ALL FROM ZERUBBABEL DOWN TO THE LAST HIRAM WERE SUCH AS YOU SEE
MY FATHER
BEFORE THAT THERE WAS A GODFREY
WE HAVE HIS PICTURE IT
HANGS IN MOORE'S BEDROOM IT IS LIKE ME
OF HIS CHARACTER WE KNOW
NOTHING BUT I AM SURE IT WAS DIFFERENT TO HIS DESCENDANTS
HE HAS LONG
CURLING DARK HAIR HE IS CAREFULLY AND CAVALIERLY DRESSED
HAVING SAID
THAT HE IS LIKE ME I NEED NOT ADD THAT HE IS HANDSOME
YOU ARE NOT HANDSOME MARTIN
NO BUT WAIT AWHILE JUST LET ME TAKE MY TIME
I MEAN TO BEGIN FROM
THIS DAY TO CULTIVATE TO POLISH AND WE SHALL SEE
YOU ARE A VERY STRANGE A VERY UNACCOUNTABLE BOY MARTIN
BUT DON'T
IMAGINE YOU EVER WILL BE HANDSOME YOU CANNOT
I MEAN TO TRY
BUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MRS
PRYOR
SHE MUST BE THE
MOST UNNATURAL MAMMA IN EXISTENCE COOLLY TO LET HER DAUGHTER COME OUT
IN THIS WEATHER
MINE WAS IN SUCH A RAGE BECAUSE I WOULD GO TO CHURCH
SHE WAS FIT TO FLING THE KITCHEN BRUSH AFTER ME
MAMMA WAS VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT ME BUT I AM AFRAID I WAS
OBSTINATE
I WOULD GO
TO SEE ME
EXACTLY I THOUGHT OF NOTHING ELSE
I GREATLY FEARED THE SNOW WOULD
HINDER YOU FROM COMING
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW PLEASED I WAS TO SEE YOU ALL
BY YOURSELF IN THE PEW
I CAME TO FULFIL MY DUTY AND SET THE PARISH A GOOD EXAMPLE
AND SO
YOU WERE OBSTINATE WERE YOU I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU OBSTINATE I
SHOULD
WOULDN'T I HAVE YOU IN GOOD DISCIPLINE IF I OWNED YOU LET ME
TAKE THE UMBRELLA
I CAN'T STAY TWO MINUTES OUR DINNER WILL BE READY
AND SO WILL OURS AND WE HAVE ALWAYS A HOT DINNER ON SUNDAYS
ROAST
GOOSE TO DAY WITH APPLE PIE AND RICE PUDDING
I ALWAYS CONTRIVE TO KNOW
THE BILL OF FARE
WELL I LIKE THESE THINGS UNCOMMONLY BUT I'LL MAKE
THE SACRIFICE IF YOU WILL
WE HAVE A COLD DINNER
MY UNCLE WILL ALLOW NO UNNECESSARY COOKING ON
THE SABBATH
BUT I MUST RETURN THE HOUSE WOULD BE IN COMMOTION IF I
FAILED TO APPEAR
SO WILL BRIARMAINS BLESS YOU I THINK I HEAR MY FATHER SENDING OUT THE
OVERLOOKER AND FIVE OF THE DYERS TO LOOK IN SIX DIRECTIONS FOR THE BODY
OF HIS PRODIGAL SON IN THE SNOW AND MY MOTHER REPENTING HER OF HER
MANY MISDEEDS TOWARDS ME NOW I AM GONE
MARTIN HOW IS MR
MOORE
THAT IS WHAT YOU CAME FOR JUST TO SAY THAT WORD
COME TELL ME QUICKLY
HANG HIM HE IS NO WORSE BUT AS ILL USED AS EVER MEWED UP KEPT IN
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
THEY MEAN TO MAKE EITHER AN IDIOT OR A MANIAC OF
HIM AND TAKE OUT A COMMISSION OF LUNACY
HORSFALL STARVES HIM YOU SAW
HOW THIN HE WAS
YOU WERE VERY GOOD THE OTHER DAY MARTIN
WHAT DAY I AM ALWAYS GOOD A MODEL
WHEN WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AGAIN
I SEE WHAT YOU ARE AFTER BUT YOU'LL NOT WHEEDLE ME I AM NO
CAT'S PAW
BUT IT MUST BE DONE
IT IS QUITE A RIGHT THING AND A NECESSARY THING
HOW YOU ENCROACH REMEMBER I MANAGED THE MATTER OF MY OWN FREE WILL
BEFORE
AND YOU WILL AGAIN
I WON'T
THE BUSINESS GAVE ME FAR TOO MUCH TROUBLE
I LIKE MY EASE
MR
MOORE WISHES TO SEE ME MARTIN AND I WISH TO SEE HIM
I DARE SAY COOLLY
IT IS TOO BAD OF YOUR MOTHER TO EXCLUDE HIS FRIENDS
TELL HER SO
HIS OWN RELATIONS
COME AND BLOW HER UP
YOU KNOW THAT WOULD ADVANCE NOTHING
WELL I SHALL STICK TO MY POINT
SEE HIM I WILL
IF YOU WON'T HELP ME I'LL MANAGE WITHOUT HELP
DO THERE IS NOTHING LIKE SELF RELIANCE SELF DEPENDENCE
I HAVE NO TIME TO REASON WITH YOU NOW BUT I CONSIDER YOU PROVOKING
GOOD MORNING
AWAY SHE WENT THE UMBRELLA SHUT FOR SHE COULD NOT CARRY IT AGAINST THE
WIND
SHE IS NOT VAPID SHE IS NOT SHALLOW SAID MARTIN
I SHALL LIKE TO
WATCH AND MARK HOW SHE WILL WORK HER WAY WITHOUT HELP
IF THE STORM
WERE NOT OF SNOW BUT OF FIRE SUCH AS CAME REFRESHINGLY DOWN ON THE
CITIES OF THE PLAIN SHE WOULD GO THROUGH IT TO PROCURE FIVE MINUTES'
SPEECH OF THAT MOORE
NOW I CONSIDER I HAVE HAD A PLEASANT MORNING
THE DISAPPOINTMENTS GOT TIME ON THE FEARS AND FITS OF ANGER ONLY MADE
THAT SHORT DISCOURSE PLEASANTER WHEN IT CAME AT LAST
SHE EXPECTED TO
COAX ME AT ONCE
SHE'LL NOT MANAGE THAT IN ONE EFFORT
SHE SHALL COME
AGAIN AGAIN AND YET AGAIN
IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO PUT HER IN A
PASSION TO MAKE HER CRY
I WANT TO DISCOVER HOW FAR SHE WILL GO WHAT
SHE WILL DO AND DARE TO GET HER WILL
IT SEEMS STRANGE AND NEW TO FIND
ONE HUMAN BEING THINKING SO MUCH ABOUT ANOTHER AS SHE THINKS ABOUT
MOORE
BUT IT IS TIME TO GO HOME MY APPETITE TELLS ME THE HOUR
WON'T I
WALK INTO THAT GOOSE AND WE'LL TRY WHETHER MATTHEW OR I SHALL GET THE
LARGEST CUT OF THE APPLE PIE TO DAY
CHAPTER XXXV
WHEREIN MATTERS MAKE SOME PROGRESS BUT NOT MUCH
MARTIN HAD PLANNED WELL
HE HAD LAID OUT A DEXTEROUSLY CONCERTED SCHEME
FOR HIS PRIVATE AMUSEMENT
BUT OLDER AND WISER SCHEMERS THAN HE ARE
OFTEN DOOMED TO SEE THEIR FINEST SPUN PROJECTS SWEPT TO ANNIHILATION BY
THE SUDDEN BROOM OF FATE THAT FELL HOUSEWIFE WHOSE RED ARM NONE CAN
CONTROL
IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THIS BROOM WAS MANUFACTURED OUT OF THE
TOUGH FIBRES OF MOORE'S OWN STUBBORN PURPOSE BOUND TIGHT WITH HIS WILL
HE WAS NOW RESUMING HIS STRENGTH AND MAKING STRANGE HEAD AGAINST MRS
HORSFALL
EACH MORNING HE AMAZED THAT MATRON WITH A FRESH ASTONISHMENT
FIRST HE DISCHARGED HER FROM HER VALET DUTIES HE WOULD DRESS HIMSELF
THEN HE REFUSED THE COFFEE SHE BROUGHT HIM HE WOULD BREAKFAST WITH THE
FAMILY
LASTLY HE FORBADE HER HIS CHAMBER
ON THE SAME DAY AMIDST THE
OUTCRIES OF ALL THE WOMEN IN THE PLACE HE PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF DOORS
THE MORNING AFTER HE FOLLOWED MR
YORKE TO HIS COUNTING HOUSE AND
REQUESTED AN ENVOY TO FETCH A CHAISE FROM THE RED HOUSE INN
HE WAS
RESOLVED HE SAID TO RETURN HOME TO THE HOLLOW THAT VERY AFTERNOON
MR
YORKE INSTEAD OF OPPOSING AIDED AND ABETTED HIM
THE CHAISE WAS SENT
FOR THOUGH MRS
YORKE DECLARED THE STEP WOULD BE HIS DEATH
IT CAME
MOORE LITTLE DISPOSED TO SPEAK MADE HIS PURSE DO DUTY FOR HIS TONGUE
HE EXPRESSED HIS GRATITUDE TO THE SERVANTS AND TO MRS
HORSFALL BY THE
CHINK OF HIS COIN
THE LATTER PERSONAGE APPROVED AND UNDERSTOOD THIS
LANGUAGE PERFECTLY IT MADE AMENDS FOR ALL PREVIOUS CONTUMACY
SHE AND
HER PATIENT PARTED THE BEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD
THE KITCHEN VISITED AND SOOTHED MOORE BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE PARLOUR
HE
HAD MRS
YORKE TO APPEASE NOT QUITE SO EASY A TASK AS THE PACIFICATION
OF HER HOUSEMAIDS
THERE SHE SAT PLUNGED IN SULLEN DUDGEON THE
GLOOMIEST SPECULATIONS ON THE DEPTHS OF MAN'S INGRATITUDE ABSORBING HER
THOUGHTS
HE DREW NEAR AND BENT OVER HER SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LOOK UP
IF IT WERE ONLY TO BID HIM AVAUNT THERE WAS BEAUTY STILL IN HIS PALE
WASTED FEATURES THERE WAS EARNESTNESS AND A SORT OF SWEETNESS FOR HE
WAS SMILING IN HIS HOLLOW EYES
GOOD BYE HE SAID AND AS HE SPOKE THE SMILE GLITTERED AND MELTED
HE
HAD NO IRON MASTERY OF HIS SENSATIONS NOW A TRIFLING EMOTION MADE
ITSELF APPARENT IN HIS PRESENT WEAK STATE
AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO LEAVE US FOR SHE ASKED
WE WILL KEEP YOU
AND DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD FOR YOU IF YOU WILL ONLY STAY TILL YOU ARE
STRONGER
GOOD BYE HE AGAIN SAID AND ADDED YOU HAVE BEEN A MOTHER TO ME
GIVE YOUR WILFUL SON ONE EMBRACE
LIKE A FOREIGNER AS HE WAS HE OFFERED HER FIRST ONE CHEEK THEN THE
OTHER
SHE KISSED HIM
WHAT A TROUBLE WHAT A BURDEN I HAVE BEEN TO YOU HE MUTTERED
YOU ARE THE WORST TROUBLE NOW HEADSTRONG YOUTH WAS THE ANSWER
I
WONDER WHO IS TO NURSE YOU AT HOLLOW'S COTTAGE YOUR SISTER HORTENSE
KNOWS NO MORE ABOUT SUCH MATTERS THAN A CHILD
THANK GOD FOR I HAVE HAD NURSING ENOUGH TO LAST ME MY LIFE
HERE THE LITTLE GIRLS CAME IN JESSIE CRYING ROSE QUIET BUT GRAVE
MOORE TOOK THEM OUT INTO THE HALL TO SOOTHE PET AND KISS THEM
HE KNEW
IT WAS NOT IN THEIR MOTHER'S NATURE TO BEAR TO SEE ANY LIVING THING
CARESSED BUT HERSELF
SHE WOULD HAVE FELT ANNOYED HAD HE FONDLED A
KITTEN IN HER PRESENCE
THE BOYS WERE STANDING ABOUT THE CHAISE AS MOORE ENTERED IT BUT FOR
THEM HE HAD NO FAREWELL
TO MR
YORKE HE ONLY SAID YOU HAVE A GOOD
RIDDANCE OF ME
THAT WAS AN UNLUCKY SHOT FOR YOU YORKE IT TURNED
BRIARMAINS INTO AN HOSPITAL
COME AND SEE ME AT THE COTTAGE SOON
HE DREW UP THE GLASS THE CHAISE ROLLED AWAY
IN HALF AN HOUR HE
ALIGHTED AT HIS OWN GARDEN WICKET
HAVING PAID THE DRIVER AND DISMISSED
THE VEHICLE HE LEANED ON THAT WICKET AN INSTANT AT ONCE TO REST AND TO
MUSE
SIX MONTHS AGO I PASSED OUT AT THIS GATE SAID HE A PROUD ANGRY
DISAPPOINTED MAN
I COME BACK SADDER AND WISER WEAKLY ENOUGH BUT NOT
WORRIED
A COLD GRAY YET QUIET WORLD LIES ROUND A WORLD WHERE IF I
HOPE LITTLE I FEAR NOTHING
ALL SLAVISH TERRORS OF EMBARRASSMENT HAVE
LEFT ME
LET THE WORST COME I CAN WORK AS JOE SCOTT DOES FOR AN
HONOURABLE LIVING IN SUCH DOOM I YET SEE SOME HARDSHIP BUT NO
DEGRADATION
FORMERLY PECUNIARY RUIN WAS EQUIVALENT IN MY EYES TO
PERSONAL DISHONOUR
IT IS NOT SO NOW I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
RUIN IS
AN EVIL BUT ONE FOR WHICH I AM PREPARED THE DAY OF WHOSE COMING I
KNOW FOR I HAVE CALCULATED
I CAN YET PUT IT OFF SIX MONTHS NOT AN
HOUR LONGER
IF THINGS BY THAT TIME ALTER WHICH IS NOT PROBABLE IF
FETTERS WHICH NOW SEEM INDISSOLUBLE SHOULD BE LOOSENED FROM OUR TRADE
OF ALL THINGS THE MOST UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN I MIGHT CONQUER IN THIS
LONG STRUGGLE YET I MIGHT GOOD GOD WHAT MIGHT I NOT DO BUT THE
THOUGHT IS A BRIEF MADNESS LET ME SEE THINGS WITH SANE EYES
RUIN WILL
COME LAY HER AXE TO MY FORTUNE'S ROOTS AND HEW THEM DOWN
I SHALL
SNATCH A SAPLING I SHALL CROSS THE SEA AND PLANT IT IN AMERICAN WOODS
LOUIS WILL GO WITH ME
WILL NONE BUT LOUIS GO I CANNOT TELL I HAVE NO
RIGHT TO ASK
HE ENTERED THE HOUSE
IT WAS AFTERNOON TWILIGHT YET OUT OF DOORS STARLESS AND MOONLESS
TWILIGHT FOR THOUGH KEENLY FREEZING WITH A DRY BLACK FROST HEAVEN
WORE A MASK OF CLOUDS CONGEALED AND FAST LOCKED
THE MILL DAM TOO WAS
FROZEN
THE HOLLOW WAS VERY STILL
INDOORS IT WAS ALREADY DARK
SARAH
HAD LIT A GOOD FIRE IN THE PARLOUR SHE WAS PREPARING TEA IN THE
KITCHEN
HORTENSE SAID MOORE AS HIS SISTER BUSTLED UP TO HELP HIM OFF WITH
HIS CLOAK I AM PLEASED TO COME HOME
HORTENSE DID NOT FEEL THE PECULIAR NOVELTY OF THIS EXPRESSION COMING
FROM HER BROTHER WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE CALLED THE COTTAGE HIS HOME AND
TO WHOM ITS NARROW LIMITS HAD ALWAYS HERETOFORE SEEMED RATHER
RESTRICTIVE THAN PROTECTIVE
STILL WHATEVER CONTRIBUTED TO HIS
HAPPINESS PLEASED HER AND SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF TO THAT EFFECT
HE SAT DOWN BUT SOON ROSE AGAIN
HE WENT TO THE WINDOW HE CAME BACK TO
THE FIRE
HORTENSE
MON FRRE
THIS LITTLE PARLOUR LOOKS VERY CLEAN AND PLEASANT UNUSUALLY BRIGHT
SOMEHOW
IT IS TRUE BROTHER I HAVE HAD THE WHOLE HOUSE THOROUGHLY AND
SCRUPULOUSLY CLEANED IN YOUR ABSENCE
SISTER I THINK ON THIS FIRST DAY OF YOUR RETURN HOME YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
A FRIEND OR SO TO TEA IF IT WERE ONLY TO SEE HOW FRESH AND SPRUCE YOU
HAVE MADE THE LITTLE PLACE
TRUE BROTHER
IF IT WERE NOT LATE I MIGHT SEND FOR MISS MANN
SO YOU MIGHT BUT IT REALLY IS TOO LATE TO DISTURB THAT GOOD LADY AND
THE EVENING IS MUCH TOO COLD FOR HER TO COME OUT
HOW THOUGHTFUL IN YOU DEAR GRARD WE MUST PUT IT OFF TILL ANOTHER
DAY
I WANT SOME ONE TO DAY DEAR SISTER SOME QUIET GUEST WHO WOULD TIRE
NEITHER OF US
MISS AINLEY
AN EXCELLENT PERSON THEY SAY BUT SHE LIVES TOO FAR OFF
TELL HARRY
SCOTT TO STEP UP TO THE RECTORY WITH A REQUEST FROM YOU THAT CAROLINE
HELSTONE SHOULD COME AND SPEND THE EVENING WITH YOU
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO MORROW DEAR BROTHER
I SHOULD LIKE HER TO SEE THE PLACE AS IT IS JUST NOW ITS BRILLIANT
CLEANLINESS AND PERFECT NEATNESS ARE SO MUCH TO YOUR CREDIT
IT MIGHT BENEFIT HER IN THE WAY OF EXAMPLE
IT MIGHT AND MUST SHE OUGHT TO COME
HE WENT INTO THE KITCHEN
SARAH DELAY TEA HALF AN HOUR HE THEN COMMISSIONED HER TO DISPATCH
HARRY SCOTT TO THE RECTORY GIVING HER A TWISTED NOTE HASTILY SCRIBBLED
IN PENCIL BY HIMSELF AND ADDRESSED MISS HELSTONE
SCARCELY HAD SARAH TIME TO GET IMPATIENT UNDER THE FEAR OF DAMAGE TO HER
TOAST ALREADY PREPARED WHEN THE MESSENGER RETURNED AND WITH HIM THE
INVITED GUEST
SHE ENTERED THROUGH THE KITCHEN QUIETLY TRIPPED UP SARAH'S STAIRS TO
TAKE OFF HER BONNET AND FURS AND CAME DOWN AS QUIETLY WITH HER
BEAUTIFUL CURLS NICELY SMOOTHED HER GRACEFUL MERINO DRESS AND DELICATE
COLLAR ALL TRIM AND SPOTLESS HER GAY LITTLE WORK BAG IN HER HAND
SHE
LINGERED TO EXCHANGE A FEW KINDLY WORDS WITH SARAH AND TO LOOK AT THE
NEW TORTOISE SHELL KITTEN BASKING ON THE KITCHEN HEARTH AND TO SPEAK TO
THE CANARY BIRD WHICH A SUDDEN BLAZE FROM THE FIRE HAD STARTLED ON ITS
PERCH AND THEN SHE BETOOK HERSELF TO THE PARLOUR
THE GENTLE SALUTATION THE FRIENDLY WELCOME WERE INTERCHANGED IN SUCH
TRANQUIL SORT AS BEFITTED COUSINS MEETING A SENSE OF PLEASURE SUBTLE
AND QUIET AS A PERFUME DIFFUSED ITSELF THROUGH THE ROOM THE
NEWLY KINDLED LAMP BURNT UP BRIGHT THE TRAY AND THE SINGING URN WERE
BROUGHT IN
I AM PLEASED TO COME HOME REPEATED MR
MOORE
THEY ASSEMBLED ROUND THE TABLE
HORTENSE CHIEFLY TALKED
SHE
CONGRATULATED CAROLINE ON THE EVIDENT IMPROVEMENT IN HER HEALTH
HER
COLOUR AND HER PLUMP CHEEKS WERE RETURNING SHE REMARKED
IT WAS TRUE
THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS CHANGE IN MISS HELSTONE
ALL ABOUT HER SEEMED
ELASTIC DEPRESSION FEAR FORLORNNESS WERE WITHDRAWN
NO LONGER
CRUSHED AND SADDENED AND SLOW AND DROOPING SHE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO
HAD TASTED THE CORDIAL OF HEART'S EASE AND BEEN LIFTED ON THE WING OF
HOPE
AFTER TEA HORTENSE WENT UPSTAIRS
SHE HAD NOT RUMMAGED HER DRAWERS FOR A
MONTH PAST AND THE IMPULSE TO PERFORM THAT OPERATION WAS NOW BECOME
RESISTLESS
DURING HER ABSENCE THE TALK PASSED INTO CAROLINE'S HANDS
SHE TOOK IT UP WITH EASE SHE FELL INTO HER BEST TONE OF CONVERSATION
A
PLEASING FACILITY AND ELEGANCE OF LANGUAGE GAVE FRESH CHARM TO FAMILIAR
TOPICS A NEW MUSIC IN THE ALWAYS SOFT VOICE GENTLY SURPRISED AND
PLEASINGLY CAPTIVATED THE LISTENER UNWONTED SHADES AND LIGHTS OF
EXPRESSION ELEVATED THE YOUNG COUNTENANCE WITH CHARACTER AND KINDLED IT
WITH ANIMATION
CAROLINE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD HEARD GOOD TIDINGS SAID MOORE AFTER
EARNESTLY GAZING AT HER FOR SOME MINUTES
DO I
I SENT FOR YOU THIS EVENING THAT I MIGHT BE CHEERED BUT YOU CHEER ME
MORE THAN I HAD CALCULATED
I AM GLAD OF THAT
AND I REALLY CHEER YOU
YOU LOOK BRIGHTLY MOVE BUOYANTLY SPEAK MUSICALLY
IT IS PLEASANT TO BE HERE AGAIN
TRULY IT IS PLEASANT I FEEL IT SO
AND TO SEE HEALTH ON YOUR CHEEK AND
HOPE IN YOUR EYE IS PLEASANT CARY BUT WHAT IS THIS HOPE AND WHAT IS
THE SOURCE OF THIS SUNSHINE I PERCEIVE ABOUT YOU
FOR ONE THING I AM HAPPY IN MAMMA
I LOVE HER SO MUCH AND SHE LOVES
ME
LONG AND TENDERLY SHE NURSED ME
NOW WHEN HER CARE HAS MADE ME
WELL I CAN OCCUPY MYSELF FOR AND WITH HER ALL THE DAY
I SAY IT IS MY
TURN TO ATTEND TO HER AND I DO ATTEND TO HER
I AM HER WAITING WOMAN
AS WELL AS HER CHILD
I LIKE YOU WOULD LAUGH IF YOU KNEW WHAT PLEASURE
I HAVE IN MAKING DRESSES AND SEWING FOR HER
SHE LOOKS SO NICE NOW
ROBERT I WILL NOT LET HER BE OLD FASHIONED
AND THEN SHE IS CHARMING
TO TALK TO FULL OF WISDOM RIPE IN JUDGMENT RICH IN INFORMATION
EXHAUSTLESS IN STORES HER OBSERVANT FACULTIES HAVE QUIETLY AMASSED
EVERY DAY THAT I LIVE WITH HER I LIKE HER BETTER I ESTEEM HER MORE
HIGHLY I LOVE HER MORE TENDERLY
THAT FOR ONE THING THEN CARY
YOU TALK IN SUCH A WAY ABOUT 'MAMMA'
IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE JEALOUS OF THE OLD LADY
SHE IS NOT OLD ROBERT
OF THE YOUNG LADY THEN
SHE DOES NOT PRETEND TO BE YOUNG
WELL OF THE MATRON
BUT YOU SAID 'MAMMA'S' AFFECTION WAS ONE THING
THAT MADE YOU HAPPY NOW FOR THE OTHER THING
I AM GLAD YOU ARE BETTER
WHAT BESIDES
I AM GLAD WE ARE FRIENDS
YOU AND I
YES
I ONCE THOUGHT WE NEVER SHOULD BE
CARY SOME DAY I MEAN TO TELL YOU A THING ABOUT MYSELF THAT IS NOT TO
MY CREDIT AND CONSEQUENTLY WILL NOT PLEASE YOU
AH DON'T I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK ILL OF YOU
AND I CANNOT BEAR THAT YOU SHOULD THINK BETTER OF ME THAN I DESERVE
WELL BUT I HALF KNOW YOUR 'THING INDEED I BELIEVE I KNOW ALL ABOUT
IT
YOU DO NOT
I BELIEVE I DO
WHOM DOES IT CONCERN BESIDES ME
SHE COLOURED SHE HESITATED SHE WAS SILENT
SPEAK CARY WHOM DOES IT CONCERN
SHE TRIED TO UTTER A NAME AND COULD NOT
TELL ME THERE IS NONE PRESENT BUT OURSELVES
BE FRANK
BUT IF I GUESS WRONG
I WILL FORGIVE
WHISPER CARY
HE BENT HIS EAR TO HER LIPS
STILL SHE WOULD NOT OR COULD NOT SPEAK
CLEARLY TO THE POINT
SEEING THAT MOORE WAITED AND WAS RESOLVED TO HEAR
SOMETHING SHE AT LAST SAID MISS KEELDAR SPENT A DAY AT THE RECTORY
ABOUT A WEEK SINCE
THE EVENING CAME ON VERY WINTRY AND WE PERSUADED
HER TO STAY ALL NIGHT
AND YOU AND SHE CURLED YOUR HAIR TOGETHER
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
AND THEN YOU CHATTERED AND SHE TOLD YOU
IT WAS NOT AT CURLING HAIR TIME SO YOU ARE NOT AS WISE AS YOU THINK
AND BESIDES SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU SLEPT TOGETHER AFTERWARDS
WE OCCUPIED THE SAME ROOM AND BED
WE DID NOT SLEEP MUCH WE TALKED THE
WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
I'LL BE SWORN YOU DID AND THEN IT ALL CAME OUT TANT PIS
I WOULD
RATHER YOU HAD HEARD IT FROM MYSELF
YOU ARE QUITE WRONG
SHE DID NOT TELL ME WHAT YOU SUSPECT SHE IS NOT
THE PERSON TO PROCLAIM SUCH THINGS BUT YET I INFERRED SOMETHING FROM
PARTS OF HER DISCOURSE
I GATHERED MORE FROM RUMOUR AND I MADE OUT THE
REST BY INSTINCT
BUT IF SHE DID NOT TELL YOU THAT I WANTED TO MARRY HER FOR THE SAKE OF
HER MONEY AND THAT SHE REFUSED ME INDIGNANTLY AND SCORNFULLY YOU NEED
NEITHER START NOR BLUSH NOR YET NEED YOU PRICK YOUR TREMBLING FINGERS
WITH YOUR NEEDLE
THAT IS THE PLAIN TRUTH WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR
NOT IF SUCH WAS NOT THE SUBJECT OF HER AUGUST CONFIDENCES ON WHAT
POINT DID THEY TURN YOU SAY YOU TALKED THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH WHAT
ABOUT
ABOUT THINGS WE NEVER THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED BEFORE INTIMATE FRIENDS AS
WE HAVE BEEN BUT YOU HARDLY EXPECT I SHOULD TELL YOU
YES YES CARY YOU WILL TELL ME
YOU SAID WE WERE FRIENDS AND FRIENDS
SHOULD ALWAYS CONFIDE IN EACH OTHER
BUT YOU ARE SURE YOU WON'T REPEAT IT
QUITE SURE
NOT TO LOUIS
NOT EVEN TO LOUIS
WHAT DOES LOUIS CARE FOR YOUNG LADIES' SECRETS
ROBERT SHIRLEY IS A CURIOUS MAGNANIMOUS BEING
I DARE SAY
I CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE BOTH ODD POINTS AND GRAND POINTS
ABOUT HER
I HAVE FOUND HER CHARY IN SHOWING HER FEELINGS BUT WHEN THEY RUSH OUT
RIVER LIKE AND PASS FULL AND POWERFUL BEFORE YOU ALMOST WITHOUT LEAVE
FROM HER YOU GAZE WONDER YOU ADMIRE AND I THINK LOVE HER
YOU SAW THIS SPECTACLE
YES AT DEAD OF NIGHT WHEN ALL THE HOUSE WAS SILENT AND STARLIGHT AND
THE COLD REFLECTION FROM THE SNOW GLIMMERED IN OUR CHAMBER THEN I SAW
SHIRLEY'S HEART
HER HEART'S CORE DO YOU THINK SHE SHOWED YOU THAT
HER HEART'S CORE
AND HOW WAS IT
LIKE A SHRINE FOR IT WAS HOLY LIKE SNOW FOR IT WAS PURE LIKE
FLAME FOR IT WAS WARM LIKE DEATH FOR IT WAS STRONG
CAN SHE LOVE TELL ME THAT
WHAT THINK YOU
SHE HAS LOVED NONE THAT HAVE LOVED HER YET
WHO ARE THOSE THAT HAVE LOVED HER
HE NAMED A LIST OF GENTLEMEN CLOSING WITH SIR PHILIP NUNNELY
SHE HAS LOVED NONE OF THESE
YET SOME OF THEM WERE WORTHY OF A WOMAN'S AFFECTION
OF SOME WOMEN'S BUT NOT OF SHIRLEY'S
IS SHE BETTER THAN OTHERS OF HER SEX
SHE IS PECULIAR AND MORE DANGEROUS TO TAKE AS A WIFE RASHLY
I CAN IMAGINE THAT
SHE SPOKE OF YOU
OH SHE DID I THOUGHT YOU DENIED IT
SHE DID NOT SPEAK IN THE WAY YOU FANCY BUT I ASKED HER AND I WOULD
MAKE HER TELL ME WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF YOU OR RATHER HOW SHE FELT TOWARDS
YOU
I WANTED TO KNOW I HAD LONG WANTED TO KNOW
SO HAD I BUT LET US HEAR
SHE THINKS MEANLY SHE FEELS CONTEMPTUOUSLY
DOUBTLESS
SHE THINKS OF YOU ALMOST AS HIGHLY AS A WOMAN CAN THINK OF A MAN
YOU
KNOW SHE CAN BE ELOQUENT
I YET FEEL IN FANCY THE GLOW OF THE LANGUAGE
IN WHICH HER OPINION WAS CONVEYED
BUT HOW DOES SHE FEEL
TILL YOU SHOCKED HER SHE SAID YOU HAD SHOCKED HER BUT SHE WOULD NOT
TELL ME HOW SHE FELT AS A SISTER FEELS TOWARDS A BROTHER OF WHOM SHE IS
AT ONCE FOND AND PROUD
I'LL SHOCK HER NO MORE CARY FOR THE SHOCK REBOUNDED ON MYSELF TILL I
STAGGERED AGAIN
BUT THAT COMPARISON ABOUT SISTER AND BROTHER IS ALL
NONSENSE
SHE IS TOO RICH AND PROUD TO ENTERTAIN FRATERNAL SENTIMENTS
FOR ME
YOU DON'T KNOW HER ROBERT AND SOMEHOW I FANCY NOW I HAD OTHER
IDEAS FORMERLY THAT YOU CANNOT KNOW HER
YOU AND SHE ARE NOT SO
CONSTRUCTED AS TO BE ABLE THOROUGHLY TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
IT MAY BE SO
I ESTEEM HER I ADMIRE HER AND YET MY IMPRESSIONS
CONCERNING HER ARE HARSH PERHAPS UNCHARITABLE
I BELIEVE FOR INSTANCE
THAT SHE IS INCAPABLE OF LOVE
SHIRLEY INCAPABLE OF LOVE
THAT SHE WILL NEVER MARRY
I IMAGINE HER JEALOUS OF COMPROMISING HER
PRIDE OF RELINQUISHING HER POWER OF SHARING HER PROPERTY
SHIRLEY HAS HURT YOUR AMOUR PROPRE
SHE DID HURT IT THOUGH I HAD NOT AN EMOTION OF TENDERNESS NOR A SPARK
OF PASSION FOR HER
THEN ROBERT IT WAS VERY WICKED IN YOU TO WANT TO MARRY HER
AND VERY MEAN MY LITTLE PASTOR MY PRETTY PRIESTESS
I NEVER WANTED TO
KISS MISS KEELDAR IN MY LIFE THOUGH SHE HAS FINE LIPS SCARLET AND
ROUND AS RIPE CHERRIES OR IF I DID WISH IT IT WAS THE MERE DESIRE OF
THE EYE
I DOUBT NOW WHETHER YOU ARE SPEAKING THE TRUTH
THE GRAPES OR THE
CHERRIES ARE SOUR 'HUNG TOO HIGH
SHE HAS A PRETTY FIGURE A PRETTY FACE BEAUTIFUL HAIR
I ACKNOWLEDGE
ALL HER CHARMS AND FEEL NONE OF THEM OR ONLY FEEL THEM IN A WAY SHE
WOULD DISDAIN
I SUPPOSE I WAS TRULY TEMPTED BY THE MERE GILDING OF THE
BAIT
CAROLINE WHAT A NOBLE FELLOW YOUR ROBERT IS GREAT GOOD
DISINTERESTED AND THEN SO PURE
BUT NOT PERFECT
HE MADE A GREAT BLUNDER ONCE AND WE WILL HEAR NO MORE
ABOUT IT
AND SHALL WE THINK NO MORE ABOUT IT CARY SHALL WE NOT DESPISE HIM IN
OUR HEART GENTLE BUT JUST COMPASSIONATE BUT UPRIGHT
NEVER WE WILL REMEMBER THAT WITH WHAT MEASURE WE METE IT SHALL BE
MEASURED UNTO US AND SO WE WILL GIVE NO SCORN ONLY AFFECTION
WHICH WON'T SATISFY I WARN YOU OF THAT
SOMETHING BESIDES
AFFECTION SOMETHING FAR STRONGER SWEETER WARMER WILL BE DEMANDED ONE
DAY
IS IT THERE TO GIVE
CAROLINE WAS MOVED MUCH MOVED
BE CALM LINA SAID MOORE SOOTHINGLY
I HAVE NO INTENTION BECAUSE I
HAVE NO RIGHT TO PERTURB YOUR MIND NOW NOR FOR MONTHS TO COME
DON'T
LOOK AS IF YOU WOULD LEAVE ME
WE WILL MAKE NO MORE AGITATING ALLUSIONS
WE WILL RESUME OUR GOSSIP
DO NOT TREMBLE LOOK ME IN THE FACE
SEE WHAT
A POOR PALE GRIM PHANTOM I AM MORE PITIABLE THAN FORMIDABLE
SHE LOOKED SHYLY
THERE IS SOMETHING FORMIDABLE STILL PALE AS YOU
ARE SHE SAID AS HER EYE FELL UNDER HIS
TO RETURN TO SHIRLEY PURSUED MOORE IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT SHE IS
EVER LIKELY TO MARRY
SHE LOVES
PLATONICALLY THEORETICALLY ALL HUMBUG
SHE LOVES WHAT I CALL SINCERELY
DID SHE SAY SO
I CANNOT AFFIRM THAT SHE SAID SO
NO SUCH CONFESSION AS 'I LOVE THIS
MAN OR THAT' PASSED HER LIPS
I THOUGHT NOT
BUT THE FEELING MADE ITS WAY IN SPITE OF HER AND I SAW IT
SHE SPOKE
OF ONE MAN IN A STRAIN NOT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD
HER VOICE ALONE WAS
SUFFICIENT TESTIMONY
HAVING WRUNG FROM HER AN OPINION ON YOUR
CHARACTER I DEMANDED A SECOND OPINION OF ANOTHER PERSON ABOUT WHOM I
HAD MY CONJECTURES THOUGH THEY WERE THE MOST TANGLED AND PUZZLED
CONJECTURES IN THE WORLD
I WOULD MAKE HER SPEAK
I SHOOK HER I CHID
HER I PINCHED HER FINGERS WHEN SHE TRIED TO PUT ME OFF WITH GIBES AND
JESTS IN HER QUEER PROVOKING WAY AND AT LAST OUT IT CAME
THE VOICE I
SAY WAS ENOUGH HARDLY RAISED ABOVE A WHISPER AND YET SUCH A SOFT
VEHEMENCE IN ITS TONES
THERE WAS NO CONFESSION NO CONFIDENCE IN THE
MATTER
TO THESE THINGS SHE CANNOT CONDESCEND BUT I AM SURE THAT MAN'S
HAPPINESS IS DEAR TO HER AS HER OWN LIFE
WHO IS IT
I CHARGED HER WITH THE FACT
SHE DID NOT DENY SHE DID NOT AVOW BUT
LOOKED AT ME
I SAW HER EYES BY THE SNOW GLEAM
IT WAS QUITE ENOUGH
I
TRIUMPHED OVER HER MERCILESSLY
WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU TO TRIUMPH DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU ARE FANCY
FREE
WHATEVER I AM SHIRLEY IS A BONDSWOMAN
LIONESS SHE HAS FOUND HER
CAPTOR
MISTRESS SHE MAY BE OF ALL ROUND HER BUT HER OWN MISTRESS SHE
IS NOT
SO YOU EXULTED AT RECOGNIZING A FELLOW SLAVE IN ONE SO FAIR AND
IMPERIAL
I DID ROBERT YOU SAY RIGHT IN ONE SO FAIR AND IMPERIAL
YOU CONFESS IT A FELLOW SLAVE
I CONFESS NOTHING BUT I SAY THAT HAUGHTY SHIRLEY IS NO MORE FREE THAN
WAS HAGAR
AND WHO PRAY IS THE ABRAHAM THE HERO OF A PATRIARCH WHO HAS ACHIEVED
SUCH A CONQUEST
YOU STILL SPEAK SCORNFULLY AND CYNICALLY AND SORELY BUT I WILL MAKE
YOU CHANGE YOUR NOTE BEFORE I HAVE DONE WITH YOU
WE WILL SEE THAT
CAN SHE MARRY THIS CUPIDON
CUPIDON HE IS JUST ABOUT AS MUCH A CUPIDON AS YOU ARE A CYCLOPS
CAN SHE MARRY HIM
YOU WILL SEE
I WANT TO KNOW HIS NAME CARY
GUESS IT
IS IT ANY ONE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
YES IN BRIARFIELD PARISH
THEN IT IS SOME PERSON UNWORTHY OF HER
I DON'T KNOW A SOUL IN
BRIARFIELD PARISH HER EQUAL
GUESS
IMPOSSIBLE
I SUPPOSE SHE IS UNDER A DELUSION AND WILL PLUNGE INTO
SOME ABSURDITY AFTER ALL
CAROLINE SMILED
DO YOU APPROVE THE CHOICE ASKED MOORE
QUITE QUITE
THEN I AM PUZZLED FOR THE HEAD WHICH OWNS THIS BOUNTEOUS FALL OF
HAZEL CURLS IS AN EXCELLENT LITTLE THINKING MACHINE MOST ACCURATE IN
ITS WORKING
IT BOASTS A CORRECT STEADY JUDGMENT INHERITED FROM
'MAMMA I SUPPOSE
AND I QUITE APPROVE AND MAMMA WAS CHARMED
'MAMMA' CHARMED MRS
PRYOR IT CAN'T BE ROMANTIC THEN
IT IS ROMANTIC BUT IT IS ALSO RIGHT
TELL ME CARY TELL ME OUT OF PITY I AM TOO WEAK TO BE TANTALIZED
YOU SHALL BE TANTALIZED IT WILL DO YOU NO HARM YOU ARE NOT SO WEAK AS
YOU PRETEND
I HAVE TWICE THIS EVENING HAD SOME THOUGHTS OF FALLING ON THE FLOOR AT
YOUR FEET
YOU HAD BETTER NOT
I SHALL DECLINE TO HELP YOU UP
AND WORSHIPPING YOU DOWNRIGHT
MY MOTHER WAS A ROMAN CATHOLIC
YOU LOOK
LIKE THE LOVELIEST OF HER PICTURES OF THE VIRGIN
I THINK I WILL EMBRACE
HER FAITH AND KNEEL AND ADORE
ROBERT ROBERT SIT STILL DON'T BE ABSURD
I WILL GO TO HORTENSE IF
YOU COMMIT EXTRAVAGANCES
YOU HAVE STOLEN MY SENSES
JUST NOW NOTHING WILL COME INTO MY MIND BUT
LES LITANIES DE LA SAINTE VIRGE
ROSE CLESTE REINE DES ANGES
TOUR D'IVOIRE MAISON D'OR IS NOT THAT THE JARGON WELL SIT DOWN
QUIETLY AND GUESS YOUR RIDDLE
BUT 'MAMMA' CHARMED THERE'S THE PUZZLE
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MAMMA SAID WHEN I TOLD HER
'DEPEND UPON IT MY
DEAR SUCH A CHOICE WILL MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF MISS KEELDAR'S LIFE
I'LL GUESS ONCE AND NO MORE
IT IS OLD HELSTONE
SHE IS GOING TO BE
YOUR AUNT
I'LL TELL MY UNCLE I'LL TELL SHIRLEY CRIED CAROLINE LAUGHING
GLEEFULLY
GUESS AGAIN ROBERT YOUR BLUNDERS ARE CHARMING
IT IS THE PARSON HALL
INDEED NO HE IS MINE IF YOU PLEASE
YOURS AY THE WHOLE GENERATION OF WOMEN IN BRIARFIELD SEEM TO HAVE
MADE AN IDOL OF THAT PRIEST
I WONDER WHY HE IS BALD SAND BLIND
GRAY HAIRED
FANNY WILL BE HERE TO FETCH ME BEFORE YOU HAVE SOLVED THE RIDDLE IF
YOU DON'T MAKE HASTE
I'LL GUESS NO MORE I AM TIRED AND THEN I DON'T CARE
MISS KEELDAR MAY
MARRY LE GRAND TURC FOR ME
MUST I WHISPER
THAT YOU MUST AND QUICKLY
HERE COMES HORTENSE COME NEAR A LITTLE
NEARER MY OWN LINA
I CARE FOR THE WHISPER MORE THAN THE WORDS
SHE WHISPERED
ROBERT GAVE A START A FLASH OF THE EYE A BRIEF LAUGH
MISS MOORE ENTERED AND SARAH FOLLOWED BEHIND WITH INFORMATION THAT
FANNY WAS COME
THE HOUR OF CONVERSE WAS OVER
ROBERT FOUND A MOMENT TO EXCHANGE A FEW MORE WHISPERED SENTENCES
HE WAS
WAITING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AS CAROLINE DESCENDED AFTER PUTTING
ON HER SHAWL
MUST I CALL SHIRLEY A NOBLE CREATURE NOW HE ASKED
IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK THE TRUTH CERTAINLY
MUST I FORGIVE HER
FORGIVE HER NAUGHTY ROBERT WAS SHE IN THE WRONG OR WERE YOU
MUST I AT LENGTH LOVE HER DOWNRIGHT CARY
CAROLINE LOOKED KEENLY UP AND MADE A MOVEMENT TOWARDS HIM SOMETHING
BETWEEN THE LOVING AND THE PETULANT
ONLY GIVE THE WORD AND I'LL TRY TO OBEY YOU
INDEED YOU MUST NOT LOVE HER THE BARE IDEA IS PERVERSE
BUT THEN SHE IS HANDSOME PECULIARLY HANDSOME
HERS IS A BEAUTY THAT
GROWS ON YOU
YOU THINK HER BUT GRACEFUL WHEN YOU FIRST SEE HER YOU
DISCOVER HER TO BE BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOU HAVE KNOWN HER FOR A YEAR
IT IS NOT YOU WHO ARE TO SAY THESE THINGS
NOW ROBERT BE GOOD
O CARY I HAVE NO LOVE TO GIVE
WERE THE GODDESS OF BEAUTY TO WOO ME I
COULD NOT MEET HER ADVANCES
THERE IS NO HEART WHICH I CAN CALL MINE IN
THIS BREAST
SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU ARE A GREAT DEAL SAFER WITHOUT
GOOD NIGHT
WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS GO LINA AT THE VERY INSTANT WHEN I MOST WANT YOU
TO STAY
BECAUSE YOU MOST WISH TO RETAIN WHEN YOU ARE MOST CERTAIN TO LOSE
LISTEN ONE OTHER WORD
TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN HEART DO YOU HEAR ME
THERE IS NO DANGER
I AM NOT CONVINCED OF THAT
THE PLATONIC PARSON FOR INSTANCE
WHO MALONE
CYRIL HALL
I OWE MORE THAN ONE TWINGE OF JEALOUSY TO THAT QUARTER
AS TO YOU YOU HAVE BEEN FLIRTING WITH MISS MANN
SHE SHOWED ME THE
OTHER DAY A PLANT YOU HAD GIVEN HER FANNY I AM READY
CHAPTER XXXVI
WRITTEN IN THE SCHOOLROOM
LOUIS MOORE'S DOUBTS RESPECTING THE IMMEDIATE EVACUATION OF FIELDHEAD BY
MR
SYMPSON TURNED OUT TO BE PERFECTLY WELL FOUNDED
THE VERY NEXT DAY
AFTER THE GRAND QUARREL ABOUT SIR PHILIP NUNNELY A SORT OF
RECONCILIATION WAS PATCHED UP BETWEEN UNCLE AND NIECE
SHIRLEY WHO
COULD NEVER FIND IT IN HER HEART TO BE OR TO SEEM INHOSPITABLE EXCEPT
IN THE SINGLE INSTANCE OF MR
DONNE BEGGED THE WHOLE PARTY TO STAY A
LITTLE LONGER
SHE BEGGED IN SUCH EARNEST IT WAS EVIDENT SHE WISHED IT
FOR SOME REASON
THEY TOOK HER AT HER WORD
INDEED THE UNCLE COULD NOT
BRING HIMSELF TO LEAVE HER QUITE UNWATCHED AT FULL LIBERTY TO MARRY
ROBERT MOORE AS SOON AS THAT GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE ABLE MR
SYMPSON
PIOUSLY PRAYED THIS MIGHT NEVER BE THE CASE TO REASSERT HIS SUPPOSED
PRETENSIONS TO HER HAND
THEY ALL STAYED
IN HIS FIRST RAGE AGAINST ALL THE HOUSE OF MOORE MR
SYMPSON HAD SO
CONDUCTED HIMSELF TOWARDS MR
LOUIS THAT THAT GENTLEMAN PATIENT OF
LABOUR OR SUFFERING BUT INTOLERANT OF COARSE INSOLENCE HAD PROMPTLY
RESIGNED HIS POST AND COULD NOW BE INDUCED TO RESUME AND RETAIN IT ONLY
TILL SUCH TIME AS THE FAMILY SHOULD QUIT YORKSHIRE
MRS
SYMPSON'S
ENTREATIES PREVAILED WITH HIM THUS FAR HIS OWN ATTACHMENT TO HIS PUPIL
CONSTITUTED AN ADDITIONAL MOTIVE FOR CONCESSION AND PROBABLY HE HAD A
THIRD MOTIVE STRONGER THAN EITHER OF THE OTHER TWO
PROBABLY HE WOULD
HAVE FOUND IT VERY HARD INDEED TO LEAVE FIELDHEAD JUST NOW
THINGS WENT ON FOR SOME TIME PRETTY SMOOTHLY
MISS KEELDAR'S HEALTH WAS
RE ESTABLISHED HER SPIRITS RESUMED THEIR FLOW
MOORE HAD FOUND MEANS TO
RELIEVE HER FROM EVERY NERVOUS APPREHENSION AND INDEED FROM THE
MOMENT OF GIVING HIM HER CONFIDENCE EVERY FEAR SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN
WING
HER HEART BECAME AS LIGHTSOME HER MANNER AS CARELESS AS THOSE OF
A LITTLE CHILD THAT THOUGHTLESS OF ITS OWN LIFE OR DEATH TRUSTS ALL
RESPONSIBILITY TO ITS PARENTS
HE AND WILLIAM FARREN THROUGH WHOSE
MEDIUM HE MADE INQUIRIES CONCERNING THE STATE OF PHBE AGREED IN
ASSERTING THAT THE DOG WAS NOT MAD THAT IT WAS ONLY ILL USAGE WHICH HAD
DRIVEN HER FROM HOME FOR IT WAS PROVED THAT HER MASTER WAS IN THE
FREQUENT HABIT OF CHASTISING HER VIOLENTLY
THEIR ASSERTION MIGHT OR
MIGHT NOT BE TRUE
THE GROOM AND GAMEKEEPER AFFIRMED TO THE
CONTRARY BOTH ASSERTING THAT IF HERS WAS NOT A CLEAR CASE OF
HYDROPHOBIA THERE WAS NO SUCH DISEASE
BUT TO THIS EVIDENCE LOUIS MOORE
TURNED AN INCREDULOUS EAR
HE REPORTED TO SHIRLEY ONLY WHAT WAS
ENCOURAGING
SHE BELIEVED HIM AND RIGHT OR WRONG IT IS CERTAIN THAT
IN HER CASE THE BITE PROVED INNOCUOUS
NOVEMBER PASSED DECEMBER CAME
THE SYMPSONS WERE NOW REALLY DEPARTING
IT WAS INCUMBENT ON THEM TO BE AT HOME BY CHRISTMAS
THEIR PACKAGES WERE
PREPARING THEY WERE TO LEAVE IN A FEW DAYS
ONE WINTER EVENING DURING
THE LAST WEEK OF THEIR STAY LOUIS MOORE AGAIN TOOK OUT HIS LITTLE BLANK
BOOK AND DISCOURSED WITH IT AS FOLLOWS
SHE IS LOVELIER THAN EVER
SINCE THAT LITTLE CLOUD WAS DISPELLED ALL
THE TEMPORARY WASTE AND WANNESS HAVE VANISHED
IT WAS MARVELLOUS TO SEE
HOW SOON THE MAGICAL ENERGY OF YOUTH RAISED HER ELASTIC AND REVIVED HER
BLOOMING
AFTER BREAKFAST THIS MORNING WHEN I HAD SEEN HER AND LISTENED TO HER
AND SO TO SPEAK FELT HER IN EVERY SENTIENT ATOM OF MY FRAME I PASSED
FROM HER SUNNY PRESENCE INTO THE CHILL DRAWING ROOM
TAKING UP A LITTLE
GILT VOLUME I FOUND IT TO CONTAIN A SELECTION OF LYRICS
I READ A POEM
OR TWO WHETHER THE SPELL WAS IN ME OR IN THE VERSE I KNOW NOT BUT MY
HEART FILLED GENIALLY MY PULSE ROSE
I GLOWED NOTWITHSTANDING THE
FROST AIR
I TOO AM YOUNG AS YET
THOUGH SHE SAID SHE NEVER CONSIDERED
ME YOUNG I AM BARELY THIRTY
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN LIFE FOR NO OTHER
REASON THAN MY OWN YOUTH BEAMS WITH SWEET HUES UPON ME
IT WAS TIME TO GO TO THE SCHOOLROOM
I WENT
THAT SAME SCHOOLROOM IS
RATHER PLEASANT IN A MORNING
THE SUN THEN SHINES THROUGH THE LOW
LATTICE THE BOOKS ARE IN ORDER THERE ARE NO PAPERS STREWN ABOUT THE
FIRE IS CLEAR AND CLEAN NO CINDERS HAVE FALLEN NO ASHES ACCUMULATED
I
FOUND HENRY THERE AND HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM MISS KEELDAR
THEY WERE
TOGETHER
I SAID SHE WAS LOVELIER THAN EVER
SHE IS
A FINE ROSE NOT DEEP BUT
DELICATE OPENS ON HER CHEEK
HER EYE ALWAYS DARK CLEAR AND SPEAKING
UTTERS NOW A LANGUAGE I CANNOT RENDER IT IS THE UTTERANCE SEEN NOT
HEARD THROUGH WHICH ANGELS MUST HAVE COMMUNED WHEN THERE WAS 'SILENCE
IN HEAVEN HER HAIR WAS ALWAYS DUSK AS NIGHT AND FINE AS SILK HER NECK
WAS ALWAYS FAIR FLEXIBLE POLISHED BUT BOTH HAVE NOW A NEW CHARM
THE
TRESSES ARE SOFT AS SHADOW THE SHOULDERS THEY FALL ON WEAR A GODDESS
GRACE
ONCE I ONLY SAW HER BEAUTY NOW I FEEL IT
HENRY WAS REPEATING HIS LESSON TO HER BEFORE BRINGING IT TO ME
ONE OF
HER HANDS WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE BOOK HE HELD THE OTHER
THAT BOY GETS
MORE THAN HIS SHARE OF PRIVILEGES HE DARES CARESS AND IS CARESSED
WHAT
INDULGENCE AND COMPASSION SHE SHOWS HIM TOO MUCH
IF THIS WENT ON
HENRY IN A FEW YEARS WHEN HIS SOUL WAS FORMED WOULD OFFER IT ON HER
ALTAR AS I HAVE OFFERED MINE
I SAW HER EYELID FLITTER WHEN I CAME IN BUT SHE DID NOT LOOK UP NOW
SHE HARDLY EVER GIVES ME A GLANCE
SHE SEEMS TO GROW SILENT TOO TO ME
SHE RARELY SPEAKS AND WHEN I AM PRESENT SHE SAYS LITTLE TO OTHERS
IN
MY GLOOMY MOMENTS I ATTRIBUTE THIS CHANGE TO INDIFFERENCE AVERSION
WHAT NOT IN MY SUNNY INTERVALS I GIVE IT ANOTHER MEANING
I SAY WERE I
HER EQUAL I COULD FIND IN THIS SHYNESS COYNESS AND IN THAT COYNESS
LOVE
AS IT IS DARE I LOOK FOR IT WHAT COULD I DO WITH IT IF FOUND
THIS MORNING I DARED AT LEAST CONTRIVE AN HOUR'S COMMUNION FOR HER AND
ME I DARED NOT ONLY WISH BUT WILL AN INTERVIEW WITH HER
I DARED
SUMMON SOLITUDE TO GUARD US
VERY DECIDEDLY I CALLED HENRY TO THE DOOR
WITHOUT HESITATION I SAID 'GO WHERE YOU WILL MY BOY BUT TILL I CALL
YOU RETURN NOT HERE
HENRY I COULD SEE DID NOT LIKE HIS DISMISSAL
THAT BOY IS YOUNG BUT
A THINKER HIS MEDITATIVE EYE SHINES ON ME STRANGELY SOMETIMES
HE HALF
FEELS WHAT LINKS ME TO SHIRLEY HE HALF GUESSES THAT THERE IS A DEARER
DELIGHT IN THE RESERVE WITH WHICH I AM TREATED THAN IN ALL THE
ENDEARMENTS HE IS ALLOWED
THE YOUNG LAME HALF GROWN LION WOULD GROWL
AT ME NOW AND THEN BECAUSE I HAVE TAMED HIS LIONESS AND AM HER KEEPER
DID NOT THE HABIT OF DISCIPLINE AND THE INSTINCT OF AFFECTION HOLD HIM
SUBDUED
GO HENRY YOU MUST LEARN TO TAKE YOUR SHARE OF THE BITTER OF
LIFE WITH ALL OF ADAM'S RACE THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE OR WILL COME AFTER
YOU
YOUR DESTINY CAN BE NO EXCEPTION TO THE COMMON LOT BE GRATEFUL
THAT YOUR LOVE IS OVERLOOKED THUS EARLY BEFORE IT CAN CLAIM ANY
AFFINITY TO PASSION
AN HOUR'S FRET A PANG OF ENVY SUFFICE TO EXPRESS
WHAT YOU FEEL
JEALOUSY HOT AS THE SUN ABOVE THE LINE RAGE DESTRUCTIVE
AS THE TROPIC STORM THE CLIME OF YOUR SENSATIONS IGNORES AS YET
I TOOK MY USUAL SEAT AT THE DESK QUITE IN MY USUAL WAY
I AM BLESSED
IN THAT POWER TO COVER ALL INWARD EBULLITION WITH OUTWARD CALM
NO ONE
WHO LOOKS AT MY SLOW FACE CAN GUESS THE VORTEX SOMETIMES WHIRLING IN MY
HEART AND ENGULFING THOUGHT AND WRECKING PRUDENCE
PLEASANT IS IT TO
HAVE THE GIFT TO PROCEED PEACEFULLY AND POWERFULLY IN YOUR COURSE
WITHOUT ALARMING BY ONE ECCENTRIC MOVEMENT
IT WAS NOT MY PRESENT
INTENTION TO UTTER ONE WORD OF LOVE TO HER OR TO REVEAL ONE GLIMPSE OF
THE FIRE IN WHICH I WASTED
PRESUMPTUOUS I NEVER HAVE BEEN PRESUMPTUOUS
I NEVER WILL BE
RATHER THAN EVEN SEEM SELFISH AND INTERESTED I WOULD
RESOLUTELY RISE GIRD MY LOINS PART AND LEAVE HER AND SEEK ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE A NEW LIFE COLD AND BARREN AS THE ROCK THE
SALT TIDE DAILY WASHES
MY DESIGN THIS MORNING WAS TO TAKE OF HER A NEAR
SCRUTINY TO READ A LINE IN THE PAGE OF HER HEART
BEFORE I LEFT I
DETERMINED TO KNOW WHAT I WAS LEAVING
I HAD SOME QUILLS TO MAKE INTO PENS
MOST MEN'S HANDS WOULD HAVE
TREMBLED WHEN THEIR HEARTS WERE SO STIRRED MINE WENT TO WORK STEADILY
AND MY VOICE WHEN I CALLED IT INTO EXERCISE WAS FIRM
'THIS DAY WEEK YOU WILL BE ALONE AT FIELDHEAD MISS KEELDAR
'YES I RATHER THINK MY UNCLE'S INTENTION TO GO IS A SETTLED ONE NOW
'HE LEAVES YOU DISSATISFIED
'HE IS NOT PLEASED WITH ME
'HE DEPARTS AS HE CAME NO BETTER FOR HIS JOURNEY
THIS IS MORTIFYING
'I TRUST THE FAILURE OF HIS PLANS WILL TAKE FROM HIM ALL INCLINATION TO
LAY NEW ONES
'IN HIS WAY MR
SYMPSON HONESTLY WISHED YOU WELL
ALL HE HAS DONE OR
INTENDED TO DO HE BELIEVED TO BE FOR THE BEST
'YOU ARE KIND TO UNDERTAKE THE DEFENCE OF A MAN WHO HAS PERMITTED
HIMSELF TO TREAT YOU WITH SO MUCH INSOLENCE
'I NEVER FEEL SHOCKED AT OR BEAR MALICE FOR WHAT IS SPOKEN IN
CHARACTER AND MOST PERFECTLY IN CHARACTER WAS THAT VULGAR AND VIOLENT
ONSET AGAINST ME WHEN HE HAD QUITTED YOU WORSTED
'YOU CEASE NOW TO BE HENRY'S TUTOR
'I SHALL BE PARTED FROM HENRY FOR A WHILE IF HE AND I LIVE WE SHALL
MEET AGAIN SOMEHOW FOR WE LOVE EACH OTHER AND BE OUSTED FROM THE BOSOM
OF THE SYMPSON FAMILY FOR EVER
HAPPILY THIS CHANGE DOES NOT LEAVE ME
STRANDED IT BUT HURRIES INTO PREMATURE EXECUTION DESIGNS LONG FORMED
'NO CHANGE FINDS YOU OFF YOUR GUARD
I WAS SURE IN YOUR CALM WAY YOU
WOULD BE PREPARED FOR SUDDEN MUTATION
I ALWAYS THINK YOU STAND IN THE
WORLD LIKE A SOLITARY BUT WATCHFUL THOUGHTFUL ARCHER IN A WOOD
AND THE
QUIVER ON YOUR SHOULDER HOLDS MORE ARROWS THAN ONE YOUR BOW IS PROVIDED
WITH A SECOND STRING
SUCH TOO IS YOUR BROTHER'S WONT
YOU TWO MIGHT GO
FORTH HOMELESS HUNTERS TO THE LONELIEST WESTERN WILDS ALL WOULD BE WELL
WITH YOU
THE HEWN TREE WOULD MAKE YOU A HUT THE CLEARED FOREST YIELD
YOU FIELDS FROM ITS STRIPPED BOSOM THE BUFFALO WOULD FEEL YOUR
RIFLE SHOT AND WITH LOWERED HORNS AND HUMP PAY HOMAGE AT YOUR FEET
'AND ANY INDIAN TRIBE OF BLACKFEET OR FLATHEADS WOULD AFFORD US A
BRIDE PERHAPS
'NO' HESITATING 'I THINK NOT
THE SAVAGE IS SORDID
I THINK THAT
IS I HOPE YOU WOULD NEITHER OF YOU SHARE YOUR HEARTH WITH THAT TO
WHICH YOU COULD NOT GIVE YOUR HEART
'WHAT SUGGESTED THE WILD WEST TO YOUR MIND MISS KEELDAR HAVE YOU BEEN
WITH ME IN SPIRIT WHEN I DID NOT SEE YOU HAVE YOU ENTERED INTO MY
DAY DREAMS AND BEHELD MY BRAIN LABOURING AT ITS SCHEME OF A FUTURE
SHE HAD SEPARATED A SLIP OF PAPER FOR LIGHTING TAPERS A SPILL AS IT
IS CALLED INTO FRAGMENTS
SHE THREW MORSEL BY MORSEL INTO THE FIRE AND
STOOD PENSIVELY WATCHING THEM CONSUME
SHE DID NOT SPEAK
'HOW DID YOU LEARN WHAT YOU SEEM TO KNOW ABOUT MY INTENTIONS
'I KNOW NOTHING
I AM ONLY DISCOVERING THEM NOW
I SPOKE AT HAZARD
'YOUR HAZARD SOUNDS LIKE DIVINATION
A TUTOR I WILL NEVER BE AGAIN
NEVER TAKE A PUPIL AFTER HENRY AND YOURSELF NOT AGAIN WILL I SIT
HABITUALLY AT ANOTHER MAN'S TABLE NO MORE BE THE APPENDAGE OF A FAMILY
I AM NOW A MAN OF THIRTY I HAVE NEVER BEEN FREE SINCE I WAS A BOY OF
TEN
I HAVE SUCH A THIRST FOR FREEDOM SUCH A DEEP PASSION TO KNOW HER
AND CALL HER MINE SUCH A DAY DESIRE AND NIGHT LONGING TO WIN HER AND
POSSESS HER I WILL NOT REFUSE TO CROSS THE ATLANTIC FOR HER SAKE HER I
WILL FOLLOW DEEP INTO VIRGIN WOODS
MINE IT SHALL NOT BE TO ACCEPT A
SAVAGE GIRL AS A SLAVE SHE COULD NOT BE A WIFE
I KNOW NO WHITE WOMAN
WHOM I LOVE THAT WOULD ACCOMPANY ME BUT I AM CERTAIN LIBERTY WILL AWAIT
ME SITTING UNDER A PINE
WHEN I CALL HER SHE WILL COME TO MY LOGHOUSE
AND SHE SHALL FILL MY ARMS
SHE COULD NOT HEAR ME SPEAK SO UNMOVED AND SHE WAS MOVED
IT WAS
RIGHT I MEANT TO MOVE HER
SHE COULD NOT ANSWER ME NOR COULD SHE LOOK
AT ME
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY IF SHE COULD HAVE DONE EITHER
HER CHEEK
GLOWED AS IF A CRIMSON FLOWER THROUGH WHOSE PETALS THE SUN SHONE HAD
CAST ITS LIGHT UPON IT
ON THE WHITE LID AND DARK LASHES OF HER DOWNCAST
EYE TREMBLED ALL THAT IS GRACEFUL IN THE SENSE OF HALF PAINFUL
HALF PLEASING SHAME
SOON SHE CONTROLLED HER EMOTION AND TOOK ALL HER FEELINGS UNDER
COMMAND
I SAW SHE HAD FELT INSURRECTION AND WAS WAKING TO EMPIRE
SHE
SAT DOWN
THERE WAS THAT IN HER FACE WHICH I COULD READ
IT SAID I SEE
THE LINE WHICH IS MY LIMIT NOTHING SHALL MAKE ME PASS IT
I FEEL I
KNOW HOW FAR I MAY REVEAL MY FEELINGS AND WHEN I MUST CLASP THE VOLUME
I HAVE ADVANCED TO A CERTAIN DISTANCE AS FAR AS THE TRUE AND SOVEREIGN
AND UNDEGRADED NATURE OF MY KIND PERMITS NOW HERE I STAND ROOTED
MY
HEART MAY BREAK IF IT IS BAFFLED LET IT BREAK
IT SHALL NEVER DISHONOUR
ME IT SHALL NEVER DISHONOUR MY SISTERHOOD IN ME
SUFFERING BEFORE
DEGRADATION DEATH BEFORE TREACHERY
I FOR MY PART SAID 'IF SHE WERE POOR I WOULD BE AT HER FEET IF SHE
WERE LOWLY I WOULD TAKE HER IN MY ARMS
HER GOLD AND HER STATION ARE
TWO GRIFFINS THAT GUARD HER ON EACH SIDE
LOVE LOOKS AND LONGS AND
DARES NOT PASSION HOVERS ROUND AND IS KEPT AT BAY TRUTH AND DEVOTION
ARE SCARED
THERE IS NOTHING TO LOSE IN WINNING HER NO SACRIFICE TO
MAKE
IT IS ALL CLEAR GAIN AND THEREFORE UNIMAGINABLY DIFFICULT
DIFFICULT OR NOT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE SOMETHING MUST BE SAID
I
COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT SIT SILENT WITH ALL THAT BEAUTY MODESTLY MUTE
IN MY PRESENCE
I SPOKE THUS AND STILL I SPOKE WITH CALM
QUIET AS MY
WORDS WERE I COULD HEAR THEY FELL IN A TONE DISTINCT ROUND AND DEEP
'STILL I KNOW I SHALL BE STRANGELY PLACED WITH THAT MOUNTAIN NYMPH
LIBERTY
SHE IS I SUSPECT AKIN TO THAT SOLITUDE WHICH I ONCE WOOED
AND FROM WHICH I NOW SEEK A DIVORCE
THESE OREADS ARE PECULIAR
THEY
COME UPON YOU WITH AN UNEARTHLY CHARM LIKE SOME STARLIGHT EVENING THEY
INSPIRE A WILD BUT NOT WARM DELIGHT THEIR BEAUTY IS THE BEAUTY OF
SPIRITS THEIR GRACE IS NOT THE GRACE OF LIFE BUT OF SEASONS OR SCENES
IN NATURE
THEIRS IS THE DEWY BLOOM OF MORNING THE LANGUID FLUSH OF
EVENING THE PEACE OF THE MOON THE CHANGEFULNESS OF CLOUDS
I WANT AND
WILL HAVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THIS ELFISH SPLENDOUR LOOKS CHILL TO MY
VISION AND FEELS FROZEN TO MY TOUCH
I AM NOT A POET I CANNOT LIVE
WITH ABSTRACTIONS
YOU MISS KEELDAR HAVE SOMETIMES IN YOUR LAUGHING
SATIRE CALLED ME A MATERIAL PHILOSOPHER AND IMPLIED THAT I LIVE
SUFFICIENTLY FOR THE SUBSTANTIAL
CERTAINLY I FEEL MATERIAL FROM HEAD TO
FOOT AND GLORIOUS AS NATURE IS AND DEEPLY AS I WORSHIP HER WITH THE
SOLID POWERS OF A SOLID HEART I WOULD RATHER BEHOLD HER THROUGH THE
SOFT HUMAN EYES OF A LOVED AND LOVELY WIFE THAN THROUGH THE WILD ORBS OF
THE HIGHEST GODDESS OF OLYMPUS
'JUNO COULD NOT COOK A BUFFALO STEAK AS YOU LIKE IT SAID SHE
'SHE COULD NOT BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHO COULD SOME YOUNG PENNILESS
FRIENDLESS ORPHAN GIRL
I WISH I COULD FIND SUCH A ONE PRETTY ENOUGH
FOR ME TO LOVE WITH SOMETHING OF THE MIND AND HEART SUITED TO MY TASTE
NOT UNEDUCATED HONEST AND MODEST
I CARE NOTHING FOR ATTAINMENTS BUT I
WOULD FAIN HAVE THE GERM OF THOSE SWEET NATURAL POWERS WHICH NOTHING
ACQUIRED CAN RIVAL ANY TEMPER FATE WILLS I CAN MANAGE THE HOTTEST
TO
SUCH A CREATURE AS THIS I SHOULD LIKE TO BE FIRST TUTOR AND THEN
HUSBAND
I WOULD TEACH HER MY LANGUAGE MY HABITS AND MY PRINCIPLES AND
THEN I WOULD REWARD HER WITH MY LOVE
REWARD HER LORD OF THE CREATION REWARD HER EJACULATED SHE
WITH A CURLED LIP
'AND BE REPAID A THOUSANDFOLD
'IF SHE WILLED IT MONSEIGNEUR
'AND SHE SHOULD WILL IT
'YOU HAVE STIPULATED FOR ANY TEMPER FATE WILLS
COMPULSION IS FLINT AND
A BLOW TO THE METAL OF SOME SOULS
'AND LOVE THE SPARK IT ELICITS
'WHO CARES FOR THE LOVE THAT IS BUT A SPARK SEEN FLOWN UPWARD AND
GONE
'I MUST FIND MY ORPHAN GIRL
TELL ME HOW MISS KEELDAR
'ADVERTISE AND BE SURE YOU ADD WHEN YOU DESCRIBE THE QUALIFICATIONS
SHE MUST BE A GOOD PLAIN COOK
'I MUST FIND HER AND WHEN I DO FIND HER I SHALL MARRY HER
'NOT YOU AND HER VOICE TOOK A SUDDEN ACCENT OF PECULIAR SCORN
I LIKED THIS
I HAD ROUSED HER FROM THE PENSIVE MOOD IN WHICH I HAD
FIRST FOUND HER
I WOULD STIR HER FURTHER
'WHY DOUBT IT
YOU MARRY
'YES OF COURSE NOTHING MORE EVIDENT THAN THAT I CAN AND SHALL
'THE CONTRARY IS EVIDENT MR
MOORE
SHE CHARMED ME IN THIS MOOD WAXING DISDAINFUL HALF INSULTING PRIDE
TEMPER DERISION BLENT IN HER LARGE FINE EYE THAT HAD JUST NOW THE
LOOK OF A MERLIN'S
'FAVOUR ME WITH YOUR REASONS FOR SUCH AN OPINION MISS KEELDAR
'HOW WILL YOU MANAGE TO MARRY I WONDER
'I SHALL MANAGE IT WITH EASE AND SPEED WHEN I FIND THE PROPER PERSON
'ACCEPT CELIBACY AND SHE MADE A GESTURE WITH HER HAND AS IF SHE GAVE
ME SOMETHING 'TAKE IT AS YOUR DOOM
'NO YOU CANNOT GIVE WHAT I ALREADY HAVE
CELIBACY HAS BEEN MINE FOR
THIRTY YEARS
IF YOU WISH TO OFFER ME A GIFT A PARTING PRESENT A
KEEPSAKE YOU MUST CHANGE THE BOON
'TAKE WORSE THEN
'HOW WHAT
I NOW FELT AND LOOKED AND SPOKE EAGERLY
I WAS UNWISE TO QUIT MY
SHEET ANCHOR OF CALM EVEN FOR AN INSTANT IT DEPRIVED ME OF AN ADVANTAGE
AND TRANSFERRED IT TO HER
THE LITTLE SPARK OF TEMPER DISSOLVED IN
SARCASM AND EDDIED OVER HER COUNTENANCE IN THE RIPPLES OF A MOCKING
SMILE
'TAKE A WIFE THAT HAS PAID YOU COURT TO SAVE YOUR MODESTY AND THRUST
HERSELF UPON YOU TO SPARE YOUR SCRUPLES
'ONLY SHOW ME WHERE
'ANY STOUT WIDOW THAT HAS HAD A FEW HUSBANDS ALREADY AND CAN MANAGE
THESE THINGS
'SHE MUST NOT BE RICH THEN
OH THESE RICHES
'NEVER WOULD YOU HAVE GATHERED THE PRODUCE OF THE GOLD BEARING GARDEN
YOU HAVE NOT COURAGE TO CONFRONT THE SLEEPLESS DRAGON YOU HAVE NOT
CRAFT TO BORROW THE AID OF ATLAS
'YOU LOOK HOT AND HAUGHTY
'AND YOU FAR HAUGHTIER
YOURS IS THE MONSTROUS PRIDE WHICH COUNTERFEITS
HUMILITY
'I AM A DEPENDANT I KNOW MY PLACE
'I AM A WOMAN I KNOW MINE
'I AM POOR I MUST BE PROUD
'I HAVE RECEIVED ORDINANCES AND OWN OBLIGATIONS STRINGENT AS YOURS
WE HAD REACHED A CRITICAL POINT NOW AND WE HALTED AND LOOKED AT EACH
OTHER
SHE WOULD NOT GIVE IN I FELT
BEYOND THIS I NEITHER FELT NOR
SAW
A FEW MOMENTS YET WERE MINE
THE END WAS COMING I HEARD ITS
RUSH BUT NOT COME
I WOULD DALLY WAIT TALK AND WHEN IMPULSE URGED I
WOULD ACT
I AM NEVER IN A HURRY I NEVER WAS IN A HURRY IN MY WHOLE
LIFE
HASTY PEOPLE DRINK THE NECTAR OF EXISTENCE SCALDING HOT I TASTE
IT COOL AS DEW
I PROCEEDED 'APPARENTLY MISS KEELDAR YOU ARE AS
LITTLE LIKELY TO MARRY AS MYSELF
I KNOW YOU HAVE REFUSED THREE NAY
FOUR ADVANTAGEOUS OFFERS AND I BELIEVE A FIFTH
HAVE YOU REJECTED
SIR PHILIP NUNNELY
I PUT THIS QUESTION SUDDENLY AND PROMPTLY
'DID YOU THINK I SHOULD TAKE HIM
'I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
'ON WHAT GROUNDS MAY I ASK
'CONFORMITY OF RANK AGE PLEASING CONTRAST OF TEMPER FOR HE IS MILD
AND AMIABLE HARMONY OF INTELLECTUAL TASTES
'A BEAUTIFUL SENTENCE LET US TAKE IT TO PIECES
CONFORMITY OF RANK
HE IS QUITE ABOVE ME
COMPARE MY GRANGE WITH HIS PALACE IF YOU PLEASE
I AM DISDAINED BY HIS KITH AND KIN
SUITABILITY OF AGE WE WERE BORN
IN THE SAME YEAR CONSEQUENTLY HE IS STILL A BOY WHILE I AM A
WOMAN TEN YEARS HIS SENIOR TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES
CONTRAST OF
TEMPER MILD AND AMIABLE IS HE I WHAT TELL ME
'SISTER OF THE SPOTTED BRIGHT QUICK FIERY LEOPARD
'AND YOU WOULD MATE ME WITH A KID THE MILLENNIUM BEING YET MILLIONS OF
CENTURIES FROM MANKIND BEING YET INDEED AN ARCHANGEL HIGH IN THE
SEVENTH HEAVEN UNCOMMISSIONED TO DESCEND UNJUST BARBARIAN HARMONY OF
INTELLECTUAL TASTES HE IS FOND OF POETRY AND I HATE IT
'DO YOU THAT IS NEWS
'I ABSOLUTELY SHUDDER AT THE SIGHT OF METRE OR AT THE SOUND OF RHYME
WHENEVER I AM AT THE PRIORY OR SIR PHILIP AT FIELDHEAD
HARMONY
INDEED WHEN DID I WHIP UP SYLLABUB SONNETS OR STRING STANZAS FRAGILE AS
FRAGMENTS OF GLASS AND WHEN DID I BETRAY A BELIEF THAT THOSE
PENNY BEADS WERE GENUINE BRILLIANTS
'YOU MIGHT HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF LEADING HIM TO A HIGHER STANDARD
OF IMPROVING HIS TASTES
'LEADING AND IMPROVING TEACHING AND TUTORING BEARING AND FORBEARING
PAH MY HUSBAND IS NOT TO BE MY BABY
I AM NOT TO SET HIM HIS DAILY
LESSON AND SEE THAT HE LEARNS IT AND GIVE HIM A SUGAR PLUM IF HE IS
GOOD AND A PATIENT PENSIVE PATHETIC LECTURE IF HE IS BAD
BUT IT IS
LIKE A TUTOR TO TALK OF THE SATISFACTION OF TEACHING I SUPPOSE YOU
THINK IT THE FINEST EMPLOYMENT IN THE WORLD
I DON'T
I REJECT IT
IMPROVING A HUSBAND NO
I SHALL INSIST UPON MY HUSBAND IMPROVING ME OR
ELSE WE PART
'GOD KNOWS IT IS NEEDED
'WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT MR
MOORE
'WHAT I SAY
IMPROVEMENT IS IMPERATIVELY NEEDED
'IF YOU WERE A WOMAN YOU WOULD SCHOOL MONSIEUR VOTRE MARI
CHARMINGLY
IT WOULD JUST SUIT YOU SCHOOLING IS YOUR VOCATION
'MAY I ASK WHETHER IN YOUR PRESENT JUST AND GENTLE MOOD YOU MEAN TO
TAUNT ME WITH BEING A TUTOR
'YES BITTERLY AND WITH ANYTHING ELSE YOU PLEASE ANY DEFECT OF WHICH
YOU ARE PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS
'WITH BEING POOR FOR INSTANCE
'OF COURSE THAT WILL STING YOU
YOU ARE SORE ABOUT YOUR POVERTY YOU
BROOD OVER THAT
'WITH HAVING NOTHING BUT A VERY PLAIN PERSON TO OFFER THE WOMAN WHO MAY
MASTER MY HEART
'EXACTLY
YOU HAVE A HABIT OF CALLING YOURSELF PLAIN
YOU ARE SENSITIVE
ABOUT THE CUT OF YOUR FEATURES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT QUITE ON AN APOLLO
PATTERN
YOU ABASE THEM MORE THAN IS NEEDFUL IN THE FAINT HOPE THAT
OTHERS MAY SAY A WORD IN THEIR BEHALF WHICH WON'T HAPPEN
YOUR FACE IS
NOTHING TO BOAST OF CERTAINLY NOT A PRETTY LINE NOR A PRETTY TINT TO
BE FOUND THEREIN
'COMPARE IT WITH YOUR OWN
'IT LOOKS LIKE A GOD OF EGYPT A GREAT SAND BURIED STONE HEAD OR
RATHER I WILL COMPARE IT TO NOTHING SO LOFTY
IT LOOKS LIKE TARTAR
YOU
ARE MY MASTIFF'S COUSIN
I THINK YOU AS MUCH LIKE HIM AS A MAN CAN BE
LIKE A DOG
'TARTAR IS YOUR DEAR COMPANION
IN SUMMER WHEN YOU RISE EARLY AND
RUN OUT INTO THE FIELDS TO WET YOUR FEET WITH THE DEW AND FRESHEN YOUR
CHEEK AND UNCURL YOUR HAIR WITH THE BREEZE YOU ALWAYS CALL HIM TO
FOLLOW YOU
YOU CALL HIM SOMETIMES WITH A WHISTLE THAT YOU LEARNED FROM
ME
IN THE SOLITUDE OF YOUR WOOD WHEN YOU THINK NOBODY BUT TARTAR IS
LISTENING YOU WHISTLE THE VERY TUNES YOU IMITATED FROM MY LIPS OR SING
THE VERY SONGS YOU HAVE CAUGHT UP BY EAR FROM MY VOICE
I DO NOT ASK
WHENCE FLOWS THE FEELING WHICH YOU POUR INTO THESE SONGS FOR I KNOW IT
FLOWS OUT OF YOUR HEART MISS KEELDAR
IN THE WINTER EVENINGS TARTAR
LIES AT YOUR FEET
YOU SUFFER HIM TO REST HIS HEAD ON YOUR PERFUMED LAP
YOU LET HIM COUCH ON THE BORDERS OF YOUR SATIN RAIMENT
HIS ROUGH HIDE
IS FAMILIAR WITH THE CONTACT OF YOUR HAND
I ONCE SAW YOU KISS HIM ON
THAT SNOW WHITE BEAUTY SPOT WHICH STARS HIS BROAD FOREHEAD
IT IS
DANGEROUS TO SAY I AM LIKE TARTAR IT SUGGESTS TO ME A CLAIM TO BE
TREATED LIKE TARTAR
'PERHAPS SIR YOU CAN EXTORT AS MUCH FROM YOUR PENNILESS AND
FRIENDLESS YOUNG ORPHAN GIRL WHEN YOU FIND HER
'OH COULD I FIND HER SUCH AS I IMAGE HER SOMETHING TO TAME FIRST AND
TEACH AFTERWARDS TO BREAK IN AND THEN TO FONDLE
TO LIFT THE DESTITUTE
PROUD THING OUT OF POVERTY TO ESTABLISH POWER OVER AND THEN TO BE
INDULGENT TO THE CAPRICIOUS MOODS THAT NEVER WERE INFLUENCED AND NEVER
INDULGED BEFORE TO SEE HER ALTERNATELY IRRITATED AND SUBDUED ABOUT
TWELVE TIMES IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND PERHAPS EVENTUALLY WHEN HER
TRAINING WAS ACCOMPLISHED TO BEHOLD HER THE EXEMPLARY AND PATIENT
MOTHER OF ABOUT A DOZEN CHILDREN ONLY NOW AND THEN LENDING LITTLE LOUIS
A CORDIAL CUFF BY WAY OF PAYING THE INTEREST OF THE VAST DEBT SHE OWES
HIS FATHER
OH' I WENT ON 'MY ORPHAN GIRL WOULD GIVE ME MANY A KISS
SHE WOULD WATCH ON THE THRESHOLD FOR MY COMING HOME OF AN EVENING SHE
WOULD RUN INTO MY ARMS SHE WOULD KEEP MY HEARTH AS BRIGHT AS SHE WOULD
MAKE IT WARM
GOD BLESS THE SWEET IDEA FIND HER I MUST
HER EYES EMITTED AN EAGER FLASH HER LIPS OPENED BUT SHE RECLOSED
THEM AND IMPETUOUSLY TURNED AWAY
'TELL ME TELL ME WHERE SHE IS MISS KEELDAR
ANOTHER MOVEMENT ALL HAUGHTINESS AND FIRE AND IMPULSE
'I MUST KNOW
YOU CAN TELL ME YOU SHALL TELL ME
'I NEVER WILL
SHE TURNED TO LEAVE ME
COULD I NOW LET HER PART AS SHE HAD ALWAYS
PARTED FROM ME NO
I HAD GONE TOO FAR NOT TO FINISH I HAD COME TOO
NEAR THE END NOT TO DRIVE HOME TO IT
ALL THE ENCUMBRANCE OF DOUBT ALL
THE RUBBISH OF INDECISION MUST BE REMOVED AT ONCE AND THE PLAIN TRUTH
MUST BE ASCERTAINED
SHE MUST TAKE HER PART AND TELL ME WHAT IT WAS I
MUST TAKE MINE AND ADHERE TO IT
'A MINUTE MADAM I SAID KEEPING MY HAND ON THE DOOR HANDLE BEFORE I
OPENED IT
'WE HAVE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION THIS MORNING BUT THE LAST
WORD HAS NOT BEEN SPOKEN YET
IT IS YOURS TO SPEAK IT
'MAY I PASS
'NO I GUARD THE DOOR
I WOULD ALMOST RATHER DIE THAN LET YOU LEAVE ME
JUST NOW WITHOUT SPEAKING THE WORD I DEMAND
'WHAT DARE YOU EXPECT ME TO SAY
'WHAT I AM DYING AND PERISHING TO HEAR WHAT I MUST AND WILL HEAR
WHAT YOU DARE NOT NOW SUPPRESS
'MR
MOORE I HARDLY KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
YOU ARE NOT LIKE YOURSELF
I SUPPOSE I HARDLY WAS LIKE MY USUAL SELF FOR I SCARED HER THAT I
COULD SEE
IT WAS RIGHT SHE MUST BE SCARED TO BE WON
'YOU DO KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I STAND BEFORE YOU
MYSELF
I HAVE FLUNG OFF THE TUTOR AND BEG TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE
MAN
AND REMEMBER HE IS A GENTLEMAN
SHE TREMBLED
SHE PUT HER HAND TO MINE AS IF TO REMOVE IT FROM THE
LOCK
SHE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TRIED TO LOOSEN BY HER SOFT TOUCH METAL
WELDED TO METAL
SHE FELT SHE WAS POWERLESS AND RECEDED AND AGAIN SHE
TREMBLED
WHAT CHANGE I UNDERWENT I CANNOT EXPLAIN BUT OUT OF HER EMOTION PASSED
INTO ME A NEW SPIRIT
I NEITHER WAS CRUSHED NOR ELATED BY HER LANDS AND
GOLD I THOUGHT NOT OF THEM CARED NOT FOR THEM
THEY WERE
NOTHING DROSS THAT COULD NOT DISMAY ME
I SAW ONLY HERSELF HER YOUNG
BEAUTIFUL FORM THE GRACE THE MAJESTY THE MODESTY OF HER GIRLHOOD
'MY PUPIL I SAID
'MY MASTER WAS THE LOW ANSWER
'I HAVE A THING TO TELL YOU
SHE WAITED WITH DECLINED BROW AND RINGLETS DROOPED
'I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT FOR FOUR YEARS YOU HAVE BEEN GROWING INTO
YOUR TUTOR'S HEART AND THAT YOU ARE ROOTED THERE NOW
I HAVE TO DECLARE
THAT YOU HAVE BEWITCHED ME IN SPITE OF SENSE AND EXPERIENCE AND
DIFFERENCE OF STATION AND ESTATE
YOU HAVE SO LOOKED AND SPOKEN AND
MOVED SO SHOWN ME YOUR FAULTS AND YOUR VIRTUES BEAUTIES RATHER THEY
ARE HARDLY SO STERN AS VIRTUES THAT I LOVE YOU LOVE YOU WITH MY LIFE
AND STRENGTH
IT IS OUT NOW
SHE SOUGHT WHAT TO SAY BUT COULD NOT FIND A WORD
SHE TRIED TO RALLY
BUT VAINLY
I PASSIONATELY REPEATED THAT I LOVED HER
'WELL MR
MOORE WHAT THEN WAS THE ANSWER I GOT UTTERED IN A TONE
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PETULANT IF IT HAD NOT FALTERED
'HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY TO ME HAVE YOU NO LOVE FOR ME
'A LITTLE BIT
'I AM NOT TO BE TORTURED
I WILL NOT EVEN PLAY AT PRESENT
'I DON'T WANT TO PLAY I WANT TO GO
'I WONDER YOU DARE SPEAK OF GOING AT THIS MOMENT
YOU GO WHAT WITH
MY HEART IN YOUR HAND TO LAY IT ON YOUR TOILET AND PIERCE IT WITH YOUR
PINS FROM MY PRESENCE YOU DO NOT STIR OUT OF MY REACH YOU DO NOT
STRAY TILL I RECEIVE A HOSTAGE PLEDGE FOR PLEDGE YOUR HEART FOR
MINE
'THE THING YOU WANT IS MISLAID LOST SOME TIME SINCE
LET ME GO AND
SEEK IT
'DECLARE THAT IT IS WHERE YOUR KEYS OFTEN ARE IN MY POSSESSION
'YOU OUGHT TO KNOW
AND WHERE ARE MY KEYS MR
MOORE INDEED AND TRULY
I HAVE LOST THEM AGAIN AND MRS
GILL WANTS SOME MONEY AND I HAVE NONE
EXCEPT THIS SIXPENCE
SHE TOOK THE COIN OUT OF HER APRON POCKET AND SHOWED IT IN HER PALM
I
COULD HAVE TRIFLED WITH HER BUT IT WOULD NOT DO LIFE AND DEATH WERE AT
STAKE
MASTERING AT ONCE THE SIXPENCE AND THE HAND THAT HELD IT I
DEMANDED 'AM I TO DIE WITHOUT YOU OR AM I TO LIVE FOR YOU
'DO AS YOU PLEASE
FAR BE IT FROM ME TO DICTATE YOUR CHOICE
'YOU SHALL TELL ME WITH YOUR OWN LIPS WHETHER YOU DOOM ME TO EXILE OR
CALL ME TO HOPE
'GO I CAN BEAR TO BE LEFT
'PERHAPS I TOO CAN BEAR TO LEAVE YOU
BUT REPLY SHIRLEY MY PUPIL
MY SOVEREIGN REPLY
'DIE WITHOUT ME IF YOU WILL LIVE FOR ME IF YOU DARE
'I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU MY LEOPARDESS
I DARE LIVE FOR AND WITH YOU
FROM THIS HOUR TILL MY DEATH
NOW THEN I HAVE YOU
YOU ARE MINE
I
WILL NEVER LET YOU GO
WHEREVER MY HOME BE I HAVE CHOSEN MY WIFE
IF I
STAY IN ENGLAND IN ENGLAND YOU WILL STAY IF I CROSS THE ATLANTIC YOU
WILL CROSS IT ALSO
OUR LIVES ARE RIVETED OUR LOTS INTERTWINED
'AND ARE WE EQUAL THEN SIR ARE WE EQUAL AT LAST
'YOU ARE YOUNGER FRAILER FEEBLER MORE IGNORANT THAN I
'WILL YOU BE GOOD TO ME AND NEVER TYRANNIZE
'WILL YOU LET ME BREATHE AND NOT BEWILDER ME YOU MUST NOT SMILE AT
PRESENT
THE WORLD SWIMS AND CHANGES ROUND ME
THE SUN IS A DIZZYING
SCARLET BLAZE THE SKY A VIOLET VORTEX WHIRLING OVER ME
I AM A STRONG MAN BUT I STAGGERED AS I SPOKE
ALL CREATION WAS
EXAGGERATED
COLOUR GREW MORE VIVID MOTION MORE RAPID LIFE ITSELF MORE
VITAL
I HARDLY SAW HER FOR A MOMENT BUT I HEARD HER VOICE PITILESSLY
SWEET
SHE WOULD NOT SUBDUE ONE OF HER CHARMS IN COMPASSION
PERHAPS SHE
DID NOT KNOW WHAT I FELT
'YOU NAME ME LEOPARDESS
REMEMBER THE LEOPARDESS IS TAMELESS SAID
SHE
'TAME OR FIERCE WILD OR SUBDUED YOU ARE MINE
'I AM GLAD I KNOW MY KEEPER AND AM USED TO HIM
ONLY HIS VOICE WILL I
FOLLOW ONLY HIS HAND SHALL MANAGE ME ONLY AT HIS FEET WILL I REPOSE
I TOOK HER BACK TO HER SEAT AND SAT DOWN BY HER SIDE
I WANTED TO HEAR
HER SPEAK AGAIN
I COULD NEVER HAVE ENOUGH OF HER VOICE AND HER WORDS
'HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE ME I ASKED
'AH YOU KNOW
I WILL NOT GRATIFY YOU I WILL NOT FLATTER
'I DON'T KNOW HALF ENOUGH MY HEART CRAVES TO BE FED
IF YOU KNEW HOW
HUNGRY AND FEROCIOUS IT IS YOU WOULD HASTEN TO STAY IT WITH A KIND WORD
OR TWO
'POOR TARTAR SAID SHE TOUCHING AND PATTING MY HAND 'POOR FELLOW
STALWART FRIEND SHIRLEY'S PET AND FAVOURITE LIE DOWN
'BUT I WILL NOT LIE DOWN TILL I AM FED WITH ONE SWEET WORD
AND AT LAST SHE GAVE IT
'DEAR LOUIS BE FAITHFUL TO ME NEVER LEAVE ME
I DON'T CARE FOR LIFE
UNLESS I MAY PASS IT AT YOUR SIDE
'SOMETHING MORE
SHE GAVE ME A CHANGE IT WAS NOT HER WAY TO OFFER THE SAME DISH TWICE
'SIR SHE SAID STARTING UP 'AT YOUR PERIL YOU EVER AGAIN NAME SUCH
SORDID THINGS AS MONEY OR POVERTY OR INEQUALITY
IT WILL BE ABSOLUTELY
DANGEROUS TO TORMENT ME WITH THESE MADDENING SCRUPLES
I DEFY YOU TO DO
IT
MY FACE GREW HOT
I DID ONCE MORE WISH I WERE NOT SO POOR OR SHE WERE
NOT SO RICH
SHE SAW THE TRANSIENT MISERY AND THEN INDEED SHE
CARESSED ME
BLENT WITH TORMENT I EXPERIENCED RAPTURE
'MR
MOORE SAID SHE LOOKING UP WITH A SWEET OPEN EARNEST
COUNTENANCE 'TEACH ME AND HELP ME TO BE GOOD
I DO NOT ASK YOU TO TAKE
OFF MY SHOULDERS ALL THE CARES AND DUTIES OF PROPERTY BUT I ASK YOU TO
SHARE THE BURDEN AND TO SHOW ME HOW TO SUSTAIN MY PART WELL
YOUR
JUDGMENT IS WELL BALANCED YOUR HEART IS KIND YOUR PRINCIPLES ARE
SOUND
I KNOW YOU ARE WISE I FEEL YOU ARE BENEVOLENT I BELIEVE YOU ARE
CONSCIENTIOUS
BE MY COMPANION THROUGH LIFE BE MY GUIDE WHERE I AM
IGNORANT BE MY MASTER WHERE I AM FAULTY BE MY FRIEND ALWAYS
'SO HELP ME GOD I WILL
YET AGAIN A PASSAGE FROM THE BLANK BOOK IF YOU LIKE READER IF YOU
DON'T LIKE IT PASS IT OVER
THE SYMPSONS ARE GONE BUT NOT BEFORE DISCOVERY AND EXPLANATION
MY
MANNER MUST HAVE BETRAYED SOMETHING OR MY LOOKS
I WAS QUIET BUT I
FORGOT TO BE GUARDED SOMETIMES
I STAYED LONGER IN THE ROOM THAN USUAL
I COULD NOT BEAR TO BE OUT OF HER PRESENCE I RETURNED TO IT AND BASKED
IN IT LIKE TARTAR IN THE SUN
IF SHE LEFT THE OAK PARLOUR
INSTINCTIVELY I ROSE AND LEFT IT TOO
SHE CHID ME FOR THIS PROCEDURE
MORE THAN ONCE
I DID IT WITH A VAGUE BLUNDERING IDEA OF GETTING A WORD
WITH HER IN THE HALL OR ELSEWHERE
YESTERDAY TOWARDS DUSK I HAD HER TO
MYSELF FOR FIVE MINUTES BY THE HALL FIRE
WE STOOD SIDE BY SIDE SHE WAS
RAILING AT ME AND I WAS ENJOYING THE SOUND OF HER VOICE
THE YOUNG
LADIES PASSED AND LOOKED AT US WE DID NOT SEPARATE
ERE LONG THEY
REPASSED AND AGAIN LOOKED
MRS
SYMPSON CAME WE DID NOT MOVE
MR
SYMPSON OPENED THE DINING ROOM DOOR
SHIRLEY FLASHED HIM BACK FULL
PAYMENT FOR HIS SPYING GAZE
SHE CURLED HER LIP AND TOSSED HER TRESSES
THE GLANCE SHE GAVE WAS AT ONCE EXPLANATORY AND DEFIANT
IT SAID 'I
LIKE MR
MOORE'S SOCIETY AND I DARE YOU TO FIND FAULT WITH MY TASTE
I ASKED 'DO YOU MEAN HIM TO UNDERSTAND HOW MATTERS ARE
'I DO SAID SHE 'BUT I LEAVE THE DEVELOPMENT TO CHANCE
THERE WILL BE
A SCENE
I NEITHER INVITE IT NOR FEAR IT ONLY YOU MUST BE PRESENT FOR
I AM INEXPRESSIBLY TIRED OF FACING HIM SOLUS
I DON'T LIKE TO SEE HIM IN
A RAGE
HE THEN PUTS OFF ALL HIS FINE PROPRIETIES AND CONVENTIONAL
DISGUISES AND THE REAL HUMAN BEING BELOW IS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL
COMMUN PLAT BAS VILAIN ET UN PEU MCHANT
HIS IDEAS ARE NOT CLEAN
MR
MOORE THEY WANT SCOURING WITH SOFT SOAP AND FULLER'S EARTH
I
THINK IF HE COULD ADD HIS IMAGINATION TO THE CONTENTS OF MRS
GILL'S
BUCKING BASKET AND LET HER BOIL IT IN HER COPPER WITH RAIN WATER AND
BLEACHING POWDER I HOPE YOU THINK ME A TOLERABLE LAUNDRESS IT WOULD
DO HIM INCALCULABLE GOOD
THIS MORNING FANCYING I HEARD HER DESCEND SOMEWHAT EARLY I WAS DOWN
INSTANTLY
I HAD NOT BEEN DECEIVED
THERE SHE WAS BUSY AT WORK IN THE
BREAKFAST PARLOUR OF WHICH THE HOUSEMAID WAS COMPLETING THE ARRANGEMENT
AND DUSTING
SHE HAD RISEN BETIMES TO FINISH SOME LITTLE KEEPSAKE SHE
INTENDED FOR HENRY
I GOT ONLY A COOL RECEPTION WHICH I ACCEPTED TILL
THE GIRL WAS GONE TAKING MY BOOK TO THE WINDOW SEAT VERY QUIETLY
EVEN
WHEN WE WERE ALONE I WAS SLOW TO DISTURB HER
TO SIT WITH HER IN SIGHT
WAS HAPPINESS AND THE PROPER HAPPINESS FOR EARLY MORNING SERENE
INCOMPLETE BUT PROGRESSIVE
HAD I BEEN OBTRUSIVE I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE
ENCOUNTERED REBUFF
'NOT AT HOME TO SUITORS' WAS WRITTEN ON HER BROW
THEREFORE I READ ON STOLE NOW AND THEN A LOOK WATCHED HER COUNTENANCE
SOFTEN AND OPEN AS SHE FELT I RESPECTED HER MOOD AND ENJOYED THE GENTLE
CONTENT OF THE MOMENT
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US SHRANK AND THE LIGHT HOAR FROST THAWED
INSENSIBLY
ERE AN HOUR ELAPSED I WAS AT HER SIDE WATCHING HER SEW
GATHERING HER SWEET SMILES AND HER MERRY WORDS WHICH FELL FOR ME
ABUNDANTLY
WE SAT AS WE HAD A RIGHT TO SIT SIDE BY SIDE MY ARM
RESTED ON HER CHAIR I WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO COUNT THE STITCHES OF HER
WORK AND TO DISCERN THE EYE OF HER NEEDLE
THE DOOR SUDDENLY OPENED
I BELIEVE IF I HAD JUST THEN STARTED FROM HER SHE WOULD HAVE
DESPISED ME
THANKS TO THE PHLEGM OF MY NATURE I RARELY START
WHEN I
AM WELL OFF BIEN COMFORTABLE I AM NOT SOON STIRRED
BIEN I
WAS TRS BIEN CONSEQUENTLY IMMUTABLE
NO MUSCLE MOVED
I HARDLY
LOOKED TO THE DOOR
'GOOD MORNING UNCLE SAID SHE ADDRESSING THAT PERSONAGE WHO PAUSED
ON THE THRESHOLD IN A STATE OF PETRIFACTION
'HAVE YOU BEEN LONG DOWNSTAIRS MISS KEELDAR AND ALONE WITH MR
MOORE
'YES A VERY LONG TIME
WE BOTH CAME DOWN EARLY IT WAS SCARCELY
LIGHT
'THE PROCEEDING IS IMPROPER
'IT WAS AT FIRST I WAS RATHER CROSS AND NOT CIVIL BUT YOU WILL
PERCEIVE THAT WE ARE NOW FRIENDS
'I PERCEIVE MORE THAN YOU WOULD WISH ME TO PERCEIVE
'HARDLY SIR SAID I 'WE HAVE NO DISGUISES
WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO
INTIMATE THAT ANY FURTHER OBSERVATIONS YOU HAVE TO MAKE MAY AS WELL BE
ADDRESSED TO ME HENCEFORWARD I STAND BETWEEN MISS KEELDAR AND ALL
ANNOYANCE
YOU WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH MISS KEELDAR
'TO PROTECT WATCH OVER SERVE HER
'YOU SIR YOU THE TUTOR
'NOT ONE WORD OF INSULT SIR INTERPOSED SHE 'NOT ONE SYLLABLE OF
DISRESPECT TO MR
MOORE IN THIS HOUSE
'DO YOU TAKE HIS PART
HIS PART OH YES
SHE TURNED TO ME WITH A SUDDEN FOND MOVEMENT WHICH I MET BY CIRCLING
HER WITH MY ARM
SHE AND I BOTH ROSE
'GOOD GED WAS THE CRY FROM THE MORNING GOWN STANDING QUIVERING AT THE
DOOR
GED I THINK MUST BE THE COGNOMEN OF MR
SYMPSON'S LARES
WHEN
HARD PRESSED HE ALWAYS INVOKES THIS IDOL
'COME FORWARD UNCLE YOU SHALL HEAR ALL TELL HIM ALL LOUIS
'I DARE HIM TO SPEAK THE BEGGAR THE KNAVE THE SPECIOUS HYPOCRITE
THE VILE INSINUATING INFAMOUS MENIAL STAND APART FROM MY NIECE SIR
LET HER GO
SHE CLUNG TO ME WITH ENERGY
'I AM NEAR MY FUTURE HUSBAND SHE SAID
'WHO DARES TOUCH HIM OR ME
'HER HUSBAND HE RAISED AND SPREAD HIS HANDS
HE DROPPED INTO A SEAT
'A WHILE AGO YOU WANTED MUCH TO KNOW WHOM I MEANT TO MARRY
MY
INTENTION WAS THEN FORMED BUT NOT MATURE FOR COMMUNICATION
NOW IT IS
RIPE SUN MELLOWED PERFECT
TAKE THE CRIMSON PEACH TAKE LOUIS MOORE
'BUT' SAVAGELY 'YOU SHALL NOT HAVE HIM HE SHALL NOT HAVE YOU
'I WOULD DIE BEFORE I WOULD HAVE ANOTHER
I WOULD DIE IF I MIGHT NOT
HAVE HIM
HE UTTERED WORDS WITH WHICH THIS PAGE SHALL NEVER BE POLLUTED
SHE TURNED WHITE AS DEATH SHE SHOOK ALL OVER SHE LOST HER STRENGTH
I
LAID HER DOWN ON THE SOFA JUST LOOKED TO ASCERTAIN THAT SHE HAD NOT
FAINTED OF WHICH WITH A DIVINE SMILE SHE ASSURED ME
I KISSED HER
AND THEN IF I WERE TO PERISH I CANNOT GIVE A CLEAR ACCOUNT OF WHAT
HAPPENED IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES
SHE HAS SINCE THROUGH
TEARS LAUGHTER AND TREMBLING TOLD ME THAT I TURNED TERRIBLE AND GAVE
MYSELF TO THE DEMON
SHE SAYS I LEFT HER MADE ONE BOUND ACROSS THE
ROOM THAT MR
SYMPSON VANISHED THROUGH THE DOOR AS IF SHOT FROM A
CANNON
I ALSO VANISHED AND SHE HEARD MRS
GILL SCREAM
MRS
GILL WAS STILL SCREAMING WHEN I CAME TO MY SENSES
I WAS THEN IN
ANOTHER APARTMENT THE OAK PARLOUR I THINK
I HELD SYMPSON BEFORE ME
CRUSHED INTO A CHAIR AND MY HAND WAS ON HIS CRAVAT
HIS EYES ROLLED IN
HIS HEAD I WAS STRANGLING HIM I THINK
THE HOUSEKEEPER STOOD WRINGING
HER HANDS ENTREATING ME TO DESIST
I DESISTED THAT MOMENT AND FELT AT
ONCE AS COOL AS STONE
BUT I TOLD MRS
GILL TO FETCH THE RED HOUSE INN
CHAISE INSTANTLY AND INFORMED MR
SYMPSON HE MUST DEPART FROM FIELDHEAD
THE INSTANT IT CAME
THOUGH HALF FRIGHTENED OUT OF HIS WITS HE DECLARED
HE WOULD NOT
REPEATING THE FORMER ORDER I ADDED A COMMISSION TO FETCH
A CONSTABLE
I SAID 'YOU SHALL GO BY FAIR MEANS OR FOUL
HE THREATENED PROSECUTION I CARED FOR NOTHING
I HAD STOOD OVER HIM
ONCE BEFORE NOT QUITE SO FIERCELY AS NOW BUT FULL AS AUSTERELY
IT WAS
ONE NIGHT WHEN BURGLARS ATTEMPTED THE HOUSE AT SYMPSON GROVE AND IN HIS
WRETCHED COWARDICE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A VAIN ALARM WITHOUT DARING TO
OFFER DEFENCE
I HAD THEN BEEN OBLIGED TO PROTECT HIS FAMILY AND HIS
ABODE BY MASTERING HIMSELF AND I HAD SUCCEEDED
I NOW REMAINED WITH HIM
TILL THE CHAISE CAME
I MARSHALLED HIM TO IT HE SCOLDING ALL THE WAY
HE WAS TERRIBLY BEWILDERED AS WELL AS ENRAGED
HE WOULD HAVE RESISTED
ME BUT KNEW NOT HOW
HE CALLED FOR HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS TO COME
I
SAID THEY SHOULD FOLLOW HIM AS SOON AS THEY COULD PREPARE
THE SMOKE
THE FUME THE FRET OF HIS DEMEANOUR WAS INEXPRESSIBLE BUT IT WAS A FURY
INCAPABLE OF PRODUCING A DEED
THAT MAN PROPERLY HANDLED MUST EVER
REMAIN IMPOTENT
I KNOW HE WILL NEVER TOUCH ME WITH THE LAW
I KNOW HIS
WIFE OVER WHOM HE TYRANNIZES IN TRIFLES GUIDES HIM IN MATTERS OF
IMPORTANCE
I HAVE LONG SINCE EARNED HER UNDYING MOTHER'S GRATITUDE BY
MY DEVOTION TO HER BOY
IN SOME OF HENRY'S AILMENTS I HAVE NURSED
HIM BETTER SHE SAID THAN ANY WOMAN COULD NURSE
SHE WILL NEVER FORGET
THAT
SHE AND HER DAUGHTERS QUITTED ME TO DAY IN MUTE WRATH AND
CONSTERNATION BUT SHE RESPECTS ME
WHEN HENRY CLUNG TO MY NECK AS I
LIFTED HIM INTO THE CARRIAGE AND PLACED HIM BY HER SIDE WHEN I ARRANGED
HER OWN WRAPPING TO MAKE HER WARM THOUGH SHE TURNED HER HEAD FROM ME I
SAW THE TEARS START TO HER EYES
SHE WILL BUT THE MORE ZEALOUSLY
ADVOCATE MY CAUSE BECAUSE SHE HAS LEFT ME IN ANGER
I AM GLAD OF
THIS NOT FOR MY OWN SAKE BUT FOR THAT OF MY LIFE AND IDOL MY
SHIRLEY
ONCE AGAIN HE WRITES A WEEK AFTER I AM NOW AT STILBRO'
I HAVE TAKEN
UP MY TEMPORARY ABODE WITH A FRIEND A PROFESSIONAL MAN IN WHOSE
BUSINESS I CAN BE USEFUL
EVERY DAY I RIDE OVER TO FIELDHEAD
HOW LONG
WILL IT BE BEFORE I CAN CALL THAT PLACE MY HOME AND ITS MISTRESS MINE
I AM NOT EASY NOT TRANQUIL I AM TANTALIZED SOMETIMES TORTURED
TO SEE
HER NOW ONE WOULD THINK SHE HAD NEVER PRESSED HER CHEEK TO MY SHOULDER
OR CLUNG TO ME WITH TENDERNESS OR TRUST
I FEEL UNSAFE SHE RENDERS ME
MISERABLE
I AM SHUNNED WHEN I VISIT HER SHE WITHDRAWS FROM MY REACH
ONCE THIS DAY I LIFTED HER FACE RESOLVED TO GET A FULL LOOK DOWN HER
DEEP DARK EYES
DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE WHAT I READ THERE PANTHERESS
BEAUTIFUL FOREST BORN WILY TAMELESS PEERLESS NATURE SHE GNAWS HER
CHAIN I SEE THE WHITE TEETH WORKING AT THE STEEL SHE HAS DREAMS OF HER
WILD WOODS AND PININGS AFTER VIRGIN FREEDOM
I WISH SYMPSON WOULD COME
AGAIN AND OBLIGE HER AGAIN TO ENTWINE HER ARMS ABOUT ME
I WISH THERE
WAS DANGER SHE SHOULD LOSE ME AS THERE IS RISK I SHALL LOSE HER
NO
FINAL LOSS I DO NOT FEAR BUT LONG DELAY
IT IS NOW NIGHT MIDNIGHT
I HAVE SPENT THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AT
FIELDHEAD
SOME HOURS AGO SHE PASSED ME COMING DOWN THE OAK STAIRCASE
TO THE HALL
SHE DID NOT KNOW I WAS STANDING IN THE TWILIGHT NEAR THE
STAIRCASE WINDOW LOOKING AT THE FROST BRIGHT CONSTELLATIONS
HOW
CLOSELY SHE GLIDED AGAINST THE BANISTERS HOW SHYLY SHONE HER LARGE EYES
UPON ME HOW EVANESCENT FUGITIVE FITFUL SHE LOOKED SLIM AND SWIFT AS
A NORTHERN STREAMER
I FOLLOWED HER INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
MRS
PRYOR AND CAROLINE HELSTONE
WERE BOTH THERE SHE HAS SUMMONED THEM TO BEAR HER COMPANY AWHILE
IN
HER WHITE EVENING DRESS WITH HER LONG HAIR FLOWING FULL AND WAVY WITH
HER NOISELESS STEP HER PALE CHEEK HER EYE FULL OF NIGHT AND LIGHTNING
SHE LOOKED I THOUGHT SPIRIT LIKE A THING MADE OF AN ELEMENT THE
CHILD OF A BREEZE AND A FLAME THE DAUGHTER OF RAY AND RAINDROP A THING
NEVER TO BE OVERTAKEN ARRESTED FIXED
I WISHED I COULD AVOID FOLLOWING
HER WITH MY GAZE AS SHE MOVED HERE AND THERE BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
I
TALKED WITH THE OTHER LADIES AS WELL AS I COULD BUT STILL I LOOKED AT
HER
SHE WAS VERY SILENT I THINK SHE NEVER SPOKE TO ME NOT EVEN WHEN
SHE OFFERED ME TEA
IT HAPPENED THAT SHE WAS CALLED OUT A MINUTE BY MRS
GILL
I PASSED INTO THE MOONLIT HALL WITH THE DESIGN OF GETTING A WORD
AS SHE RETURNED NOR IN THIS DID I FAIL
'MISS KEELDAR STAY ONE INSTANT SAID I MEETING HER
'WHY THE HALL IS TOO COLD
'IT IS NOT COLD FOR ME AT MY SIDE IT SHOULD NOT BE COLD FOR YOU
'BUT I SHIVER
'WITH FEAR I BELIEVE
WHAT MAKES YOU FEAR ME YOU ARE QUIET AND
DISTANT
WHY
'I MAY WELL FEAR WHAT LOOKS LIKE A GREAT DARK GOBLIN MEETING ME IN THE
MOONLIGHT
DO NOT DO NOT PASS STAY WITH ME AWHILE
LET US EXCHANGE A FEW
QUIET WORDS
IT IS THREE DAYS SINCE I SPOKE TO YOU ALONE
SUCH CHANGES
ARE CRUEL
'I HAVE NO WISH TO BE CRUEL SHE RESPONDED SOFTLY ENOUGH
INDEED
THERE WAS SOFTNESS IN HER WHOLE DEPORTMENT IN HER FACE IN HER VOICE
BUT THERE WAS ALSO RESERVE AND AN AIR FLEETING EVANISHING INTANGIBLE
'YOU CERTAINLY GIVE ME PAIN SAID I
'IT IS HARDLY A WEEK SINCE YOU
CALLED ME YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND AND TREATED ME AS SUCH
NOW I AM ONCE MORE
THE TUTOR FOR YOU
I AM ADDRESSED AS MR
MOORE AND SIR
YOUR LIPS HAVE
FORGOTTEN LOUIS
'NO LOUIS NO
IT IS AN EASY LIQUID NAME NOT SOON FORGOTTEN
'BE CORDIAL TO LOUIS THEN APPROACH HIM LET HIM APPROACH
'I AM CORDIAL SAID SHE HOVERING ALOOF LIKE A WHITE SHADOW
'YOUR VOICE IS VERY SWEET AND VERY LOW I ANSWERED QUIETLY ADVANCING
'YOU SEEM SUBDUED BUT STILL STARTLED
'NO QUITE CALM AND AFRAID OF NOTHING SHE ASSURED ME
'OF NOTHING BUT YOUR VOTARY
I BENT A KNEE TO THE FLAGS AT HER FEET
'YOU SEE I AM IN A NEW WORLD MR
MOORE
I DON'T KNOW MYSELF I DON'T
KNOW YOU
BUT RISE
WHEN YOU DO SO I FEEL TROUBLED AND DISTURBED
I OBEYED
IT WOULD NOT HAVE SUITED ME TO RETAIN THAT ATTITUDE LONG
I
COURTED SERENITY AND CONFIDENCE FOR HER AND NOT VAINLY
SHE TRUSTED AND
CLUNG TO ME AGAIN
'NOW SHIRLEY I SAID 'YOU CAN CONCEIVE I AM FAR FROM HAPPY IN MY
PRESENT UNCERTAIN UNSETTLED STATE
'OH YES YOU ARE HAPPY SHE CRIED HASTILY
'YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY
YOU ARE
ANY CHANGE WILL BE FOR THE WORSE
'HAPPY OR NOT I CANNOT BEAR TO GO ON SO MUCH LONGER
YOU ARE TOO
GENEROUS TO REQUIRE IT
'BE REASONABLE LOUIS BE PATIENT I LIKE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE PATIENT
'LIKE ME NO LONGER THEN LOVE ME INSTEAD
FIX OUR MARRIAGE DAY THINK
OF IT TO NIGHT AND DECIDE
SHE BREATHED A MURMUR INARTICULATE YET EXPRESSIVE DARTED OR MELTED
FROM MY ARMS AND I LOST HER
CHAPTER XXXVII
THE WINDING UP
YES READER WE MUST SETTLE ACCOUNTS NOW
I HAVE ONLY BRIEFLY TO NARRATE
THE FINAL FATES OF SOME OF THE PERSONAGES WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE WE HAVE
MADE IN THIS NARRATIVE AND THEN YOU AND I MUST SHAKE HANDS AND FOR THE
PRESENT SEPARATE
LET US TURN TO THE CURATES TO THE MUCH LOVED THOUGH LONG NEGLECTED
COME FORWARD MODEST MERIT MALONE I SEE PROMPTLY ANSWERS THE
INVOCATION
HE KNOWS HIS OWN DESCRIPTION WHEN HE HEARS IT
NO PETER AUGUSTUS WE CAN HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU
IT WON'T DO
IMPOSSIBLE TO TRUST OURSELVES WITH THE TOUCHING TALE OF YOUR DEEDS AND
DESTINIES
ARE YOU NOT AWARE PETER THAT A DISCRIMINATING PUBLIC HAS
ITS CROTCHETS THAT THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH DOES NOT ANSWER THAT PLAIN
FACTS WILL NOT DIGEST DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT THE SQUEAK OF THE REAL PIG
IS NO MORE RELISHED NOW THAN IT WAS IN DAYS OF YORE WERE I TO GIVE THE
CATASTROPHE OF YOUR LIFE AND CONVERSATION THE PUBLIC WOULD SWEEP OFF IN
SHRIEKING HYSTERICS AND THERE WOULD BE A WILD CRY FOR SAL VOLATILE AND
BURNT FEATHERS
IMPOSSIBLE WOULD BE PRONOUNCED HERE UNTRUE WOULD
BE RESPONDED THERE INARTISTIC WOULD BE SOLEMNLY DECIDED
NOTE WELL
WHENEVER YOU PRESENT THE ACTUAL SIMPLE TRUTH IT IS SOMEHOW ALWAYS
DENOUNCED AS A LIE THEY DISOWN IT CAST IT OFF THROW IT ON THE PARISH
WHEREAS THE PRODUCT OF YOUR OWN IMAGINATION THE MERE FIGMENT THE SHEER
FICTION IS ADOPTED PETTED TERMED PRETTY PROPER SWEETLY NATURAL THE
LITTLE SPURIOUS WRETCH GETS ALL THE COMFITS THE HONEST LAWFUL
BANTLING ALL THE CUFFS
SUCH IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD PETER AND AS YOU
ARE THE LEGITIMATE URCHIN RUDE UNWASHED AND NAUGHTY YOU MUST STAND
DOWN
MAKE WAY FOR MR
SWEETING
HERE HE COMES WITH HIS LADY ON HIS ARM THE MOST SPLENDID AND THE
WEIGHTIEST WOMAN IN YORKSHIRE MRS
SWEETING FORMERLY MISS DORA SYKES
THEY WERE MARRIED UNDER THE HAPPIEST AUSPICES MR
SWEETING HAVING BEEN
JUST INDUCTED TO A COMFORTABLE LIVING AND MR
SYKES BEING IN
CIRCUMSTANCES TO GIVE DORA A HANDSOME PORTION
THEY LIVED LONG AND
HAPPILY TOGETHER BELOVED BY THEIR PARISHIONERS AND BY A NUMEROUS CIRCLE
OF FRIENDS
THERE I THINK THE VARNISH HAS BEEN PUT ON VERY NICELY
ADVANCE MR
DONNE
THIS GENTLEMAN TURNED OUT ADMIRABLY FAR BETTER THAN EITHER YOU OR I
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE EXPECTED READER
HE TOO MARRIED A MOST SENSIBLE
QUIET LADY LIKE LITTLE WOMAN
THE MATCH WAS THE MAKING OF HIM
HE
BECAME AN EXEMPLARY DOMESTIC CHARACTER AND A TRULY ACTIVE PARISH PRIEST
AS A PASTOR HE TO HIS DYING DAY CONSCIENTIOUSLY REFUSED TO ACT
THE
OUTSIDE OF THE CUP AND PLATTER HE BURNISHED UP WITH THE BEST
POLISHING POWDER THE FURNITURE OF THE ALTAR AND TEMPLE HE LOOKED AFTER
WITH THE ZEAL OF AN UPHOLSTERER THE CARE OF A CABINET MAKER
HIS LITTLE
SCHOOL HIS LITTLE CHURCH HIS LITTLE PARSONAGE ALL OWED THEIR ERECTION
TO HIM AND THEY DID HIM CREDIT
EACH WAS A MODEL IN ITS WAY
IF
UNIFORMITY AND TASTE IN ARCHITECTURE HAD BEEN THE SAME THING AS
CONSISTENCY AND EARNESTNESS IN RELIGION WHAT A SHEPHERD OF A CHRISTIAN
FLOCK MR
DONNE WOULD HAVE MADE THERE WAS ONE ART IN THE MASTERY OF
WHICH NOTHING MORTAL EVER SURPASSED MR
DONNE IT WAS THAT OF BEGGING
BY HIS OWN UNASSISTED EFFORTS HE BEGGED ALL THE MONEY FOR ALL HIS
ERECTIONS
IN THIS MATTER HE HAD A GRASP OF PLAN A SCOPE OF ACTION
QUITE UNIQUE
HE BEGGED OF HIGH AND LOW OF THE SHOELESS COTTAGE BRAT
AND THE CORONETED DUKE
HE SENT OUT BEGGING LETTERS FAR AND WIDE TO OLD
QUEEN CHARLOTTE TO THE PRINCESSES HER DAUGHTERS TO HER SONS THE ROYAL
DUKES TO THE PRINCE REGENT TO LORD CASTLEREAGH TO EVERY MEMBER OF THE
MINISTRY THEN IN OFFICE AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE HE SCREWED
SOMETHING OUT OF EVERY ONE OF THESE PERSONAGES
IT IS ON RECORD THAT HE
GOT FIVE POUNDS FROM THE CLOSE FISTED OLD LADY QUEEN CHARLOTTE AND TWO
GUINEAS FROM THE ROYAL PROFLIGATE HER ELDEST SON
WHEN MR
DONNE SET OUT
ON BEGGING EXPEDITIONS HE ARMED HIMSELF IN A COMPLETE SUIT OF BRAZEN
MAIL
THAT YOU HAD GIVEN A HUNDRED POUNDS YESTERDAY WAS WITH HIM NO
REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT GIVE TWO HUNDRED TO DAY
HE WOULD TELL YOU SO
TO YOUR FACE AND TEN TO ONE GET THE MONEY OUT OF YOU
PEOPLE GAVE TO
GET RID OF HIM
AFTER ALL HE DID SOME GOOD WITH THE CASH
HE WAS
USEFUL IN HIS DAY AND GENERATION
PERHAPS I OUGHT TO REMARK THAT ON THE PREMATURE AND SUDDEN VANISHING OF
MR
MALONE FROM THE STAGE OF BRIARFIELD PARISH YOU CANNOT KNOW HOW IT
HAPPENED READER YOUR CURIOSITY MUST BE ROBBED TO PAY YOUR ELEGANT LOVE
OF THE PRETTY AND PLEASING THERE CAME AS HIS SUCCESSOR ANOTHER IRISH
CURATE MR
MACARTHEY
I AM HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO INFORM YOU WITH
TRUTH THAT THIS GENTLEMAN DID AS MUCH CREDIT TO HIS COUNTRY AS MALONE
HAD DONE IT DISCREDIT
HE PROVED HIMSELF AS DECENT DECOROUS AND
CONSCIENTIOUS AS PETER WAS RAMPANT BOISTEROUS AND THIS LAST
EPITHET I CHOOSE TO SUPPRESS BECAUSE IT WOULD LET THE CAT OUT OF THE
BAG
HE LABOURED FAITHFULLY IN THE PARISH
THE SCHOOLS BOTH SUNDAY AND
DAY SCHOOLS FLOURISHED UNDER HIS SWAY LIKE GREEN BAY TREES
BEING
HUMAN OF COURSE HE HAD HIS FAULTS
THESE HOWEVER WERE PROPER
STEADY GOING CLERICAL FAULTS WHAT MANY WOULD CALL VIRTUES
THE
CIRCUMSTANCE OF FINDING HIMSELF INVITED TO TEA WITH A DISSENTER WOULD
UNHINGE HIM FOR A WEEK
THE SPECTACLE OF A QUAKER WEARING HIS HAT IN THE
CHURCH THE THOUGHT OF AN UNBAPTIZED FELLOW CREATURE BEING INTERRED WITH
CHRISTIAN RITES THESE THINGS COULD MAKE STRANGE HAVOC IN MR
MACARTHEY'S PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ECONOMY
OTHERWISE HE WAS SANE AND
RATIONAL DILIGENT AND CHARITABLE
I DOUBT NOT A JUSTICE LOVING PUBLIC WILL HAVE REMARKED ERE THIS THAT I
HAVE THUS FAR SHOWN A CRIMINAL REMISSNESS IN PURSUING CATCHING AND
BRINGING TO CONDIGN PUNISHMENT THE WOULD BE ASSASSIN OF MR
ROBERT
MOORE
HERE WAS A FINE OPENING TO LEAD MY WILLING READERS A DANCE AT
ONCE DECOROUS AND EXCITING A DANCE OF LAW AND GOSPEL OF THE DUNGEON
THE DOCK AND THE DEAD THRAW YOU MIGHT HAVE LIKED IT READER BUT I
SHOULD NOT
I AND MY SUBJECT WOULD PRESENTLY HAVE QUARRELLED AND THEN I
SHOULD HAVE BROKEN DOWN
I WAS HAPPY TO FIND THAT FACTS PERFECTLY
EXONERATED ME FROM THE ATTEMPT
THE MURDERER WAS NEVER PUNISHED FOR THE
GOOD REASON THAT HE WAS NEVER CAUGHT THE RESULT OF THE FURTHER
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE WAS NEVER PURSUED
THE MAGISTRATES MADE A
SHUFFLING AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO RISE AND DO VALIANT THINGS BUT
SINCE MOORE HIMSELF INSTEAD OF URGING AND LEADING THEM AS HERETOFORE
LAY STILL ON HIS LITTLE COTTAGE COUCH LAUGHING IN HIS SLEEVE AND
SNEERING WITH EVERY FEATURE OF HIS PALE FOREIGN FACE THEY CONSIDERED
BETTER OF IT AND AFTER FULFILLING CERTAIN INDISPENSABLE FORMS
PRUDENTLY RESOLVED TO LET THE MATTER QUIETLY DROP WHICH THEY DID
MR
MOORE KNEW WHO HAD SHOT HIM AND ALL BRIARFIELD KNEW
IT WAS NO
OTHER THAN MICHAEL HARTLEY THE HALF CRAZED WEAVER ONCE BEFORE ALLUDED
TO A FRANTIC ANTINOMIAN IN RELIGION AND A MAD LEVELLER IN POLITICS
THE POOR SOUL DIED OF DELIRIUM TREMENS A YEAR AFTER THE ATTEMPT ON
MOORE AND ROBERT GAVE HIS WRETCHED WIDOW A GUINEA TO BURY HIM
THE WINTER IS OVER AND GONE SPRING HAS FOLLOWED WITH BEAMY AND SHADOWY
WITH FLOWERY AND SHOWERY FLIGHT
WE ARE NOW IN THE HEART OF SUMMER IN
MID JUNE THE JUNE OF 1812
IT IS BURNING WEATHER
THE AIR IS DEEP AZURE AND RED GOLD
IT FITS THE
TIME IT FITS THE AGE IT FITS THE PRESENT SPIRIT OF THE NATIONS
THE
NINETEENTH CENTURY WANTONS IN ITS GIANT ADOLESCENCE THE TITAN BOY
UPROOTS MOUNTAINS IN HIS GAME AND HURLS ROCKS IN HIS WILD SPORT
THIS
SUMMER BONAPARTE IS IN THE SADDLE HE AND HIS HOST SCOUR RUSSIAN
DESERTS
HE HAS WITH HIM FRENCHMEN AND POLES ITALIANS AND CHILDREN OF
THE RHINE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND STRONG
HE MARCHES ON OLD MOSCOW
UNDER
OLD MOSCOW'S WALLS THE RUDE COSSACK WAITS HIM
BARBARIAN STOIC HE WAITS
WITHOUT FEAR OF THE BOUNDLESS RUIN ROLLING ON
HE PUTS HIS TRUST IN A
SNOW CLOUD THE WILDERNESS THE WIND AND THE HAIL STORM ARE HIS REFUGE
HIS ALLIES ARE THE ELEMENTS AIR FIRE WATER
AND WHAT ARE THESE THREE
TERRIBLE ARCHANGELS EVER STATIONED BEFORE THE THRONE OF JEHOVAH
THEY
STAND CLOTHED IN WHITE GIRDLED WITH GOLDEN GIRDLES THEY UPLIFT VIALS
BRIMMING WITH THE WRATH OF GOD
THEIR TIME IS THE DAY OF VENGEANCE
THEIR SIGNAL THE WORD OF THE LORD OF HOSTS THUNDERING WITH THE VOICE
OF HIS EXCELLENCY
HAST THOU ENTERED INTO THE TREASURES OF THE SNOW OR HAST THOU SEEN THE
TREASURES OF THE HAIL WHICH I HAVE RESERVED AGAINST THE TIME OF
TROUBLE AGAINST THE DAY OF BATTLE AND WAR
GO YOUR WAYS
POUR OUT THE VIALS OF THE WRATH OF GOD UPON THE EARTH
IT IS DONE
THE EARTH IS SCORCHED WITH FIRE THE SEA BECOMES AS THE
BLOOD OF A DEAD MAN THE ISLANDS FLEE AWAY THE MOUNTAINS ARE NOT
FOUND
IN THIS YEAR LORD WELLINGTON ASSUMED THE REINS IN SPAIN
THEY MADE HIM
GENERALISSIMO FOR THEIR OWN SALVATION'S SAKE
IN THIS YEAR HE TOOK
BADAJOS HE FOUGHT THE FIELD OF VITTORIA HE CAPTURED PAMPELUNA HE
STORMED SAN SEBASTIAN IN THIS YEAR HE WON SALAMANCA
MEN OF MANCHESTER I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THIS SLIGHT RSUM OF WARLIKE
FACTS BUT IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE
LORD WELLINGTON IS FOR YOU ONLY A
DECAYED OLD GENTLEMAN NOW
I RATHER THINK SOME OF YOU HAVE CALLED HIM A
DOTARD YOU HAVE TAUNTED HIM WITH HIS AGE AND THE LOSS OF HIS PHYSICAL
VIGOUR
WHAT FINE HEROES YOU ARE YOURSELVES MEN LIKE YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO TRAMPLE ON WHAT IS MORTAL IN A DEMIGOD
SCOFF AT YOUR EASE YOUR
SCORN CAN NEVER BREAK HIS GRAND OLD HEART
BUT COME FRIENDS WHETHER QUAKERS OR COTTON PRINTERS LET US HOLD A
PEACE CONGRESS AND LET OUT OUR VENOM QUIETLY
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH
UNSEEMLY ZEAL ABOUT BLOODY BATTLES AND BUTCHERING GENERALS WE ARRIVE
NOW AT A TRIUMPH IN YOUR LINE
ON THE 18TH OF JUNE 1812 THE ORDERS IN
COUNCIL WERE REPEALED AND THE BLOCKADED PORTS THROWN OPEN
YOU KNOW
VERY WELL SUCH OF YOU AS ARE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER YOU MADE YORKSHIRE
AND LANCASHIRE SHAKE WITH YOUR SHOUT ON THAT OCCASION
THE RINGERS
CRACKED A BELL IN BRIARFIELD BELFRY IT IS DISSONANT TO THIS DAY
THE
ASSOCIATION OF MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS DINED TOGETHER AT STILBRO'
AND ONE AND ALL WENT HOME IN SUCH A PLIGHT AS THEIR WIVES WOULD NEVER
WISH TO WITNESS MORE
LIVERPOOL STARTED AND SNORTED LIKE A RIVER HORSE
ROUSED AMONGST HIS REEDS BY THUNDER
SOME OF THE AMERICAN MERCHANTS FELT
THREATENINGS OF APOPLEXY AND HAD THEMSELVES BLED ALL LIKE WISE MEN
AT THIS FIRST MOMENT OF PROSPERITY PREPARED TO RUSH INTO THE BOWELS OF
SPECULATION AND TO DELVE NEW DIFFICULTIES IN WHOSE DEPTHS THEY MIGHT
LOSE THEMSELVES AT SOME FUTURE DAY
STOCKS WHICH HAD BEEN ACCUMULATING
FOR YEARS NOW WENT OFF IN A MOMENT IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
WAREHOUSES WERE LIGHTENED SHIPS WERE LADEN WORK ABOUNDED WAGES ROSE
THE GOOD TIME SEEMED COME
THESE PROSPECTS MIGHT BE DELUSIVE BUT THEY
WERE BRILLIANT TO SOME THEY WERE EVEN TRUE
AT THAT EPOCH IN THAT
SINGLE MONTH OF JUNE MANY A SOLID FORTUNE WAS REALIZED
WHEN A WHOLE PROVINCE REJOICES THE HUMBLEST OF ITS INHABITANTS TASTES A
FESTAL FEELING THE SOUND OF PUBLIC BELLS ROUSES THE MOST SECLUDED
ABODE AS IF WITH A CALL TO BE GAY
AND SO CAROLINE HELSTONE THOUGHT
WHEN SHE DRESSED HERSELF MORE CAREFULLY THAN USUAL ON THE DAY OF THIS
TRADING TRIUMPH AND WENT ATTIRED IN HER NEATEST MUSLIN TO SPEND THE
AFTERNOON AT FIELDHEAD THERE TO SUPERINTEND CERTAIN MILLINERY
PREPARATIONS FOR A GREAT EVENT THE LAST APPEAL IN THESE MATTERS BEING
RESERVED FOR HER UNIMPEACHABLE TASTE
SHE DECIDED ON THE WREATH THE
VEIL THE DRESS TO BE WORN AT THE ALTAR
SHE CHOSE VARIOUS ROBES AND
FASHIONS FOR MORE ORDINARY OCCASIONS WITHOUT MUCH REFERENCE TO THE
BRIDE'S OPINION THAT LADY INDEED BEING IN A SOMEWHAT IMPRACTICABLE
MOOD
LOUIS HAD PRESAGED DIFFICULTIES AND HE HAD FOUND THEM IN FACT HIS
MISTRESS HAD SHOWN HERSELF EXQUISITELY PROVOKING PUTTING OFF HER
MARRIAGE DAY BY DAY WEEK BY WEEK MONTH BY MONTH AT FIRST COAXING HIM
WITH SOFT PRETENCES OF PROCRASTINATION AND IN THE END ROUSING HIS WHOLE
DELIBERATE BUT DETERMINED NATURE TO REVOLT AGAINST HER TYRANNY AT ONCE
SO SWEET AND SO INTOLERABLE
IT HAD NEEDED A SORT OF TEMPEST SHOCK TO BRING HER TO THE POINT BUT
THERE SHE WAS AT LAST FETTERED TO A FIXED DAY
THERE SHE LAY CONQUERED
BY LOVE AND BOUND WITH A VOW
THUS VANQUISHED AND RESTRICTED SHE PINED LIKE ANY OTHER CHAINED
DENIZEN OF DESERTS
HER CAPTOR ALONE COULD CHEER HER HIS SOCIETY ONLY
COULD MAKE AMENDS FOR THE LOST PRIVILEGE OF LIBERTY
IN HIS ABSENCE SHE
SAT OR WANDERED ALONE SPOKE LITTLE AND ATE LESS
SHE FURTHERED NO PREPARATIONS FOR HER NUPTIALS LOUIS WAS HIMSELF
OBLIGED TO DIRECT ALL ARRANGEMENTS
HE WAS VIRTUALLY MASTER OF FIELDHEAD
WEEKS BEFORE HE BECAME SO NOMINALLY THE LEAST PRESUMPTUOUS THE KINDEST
MASTER THAT EVER WAS BUT WITH HIS LADY ABSOLUTE
SHE ABDICATED WITHOUT
A WORD OR A STRUGGLE
GO TO MR
MOORE ASK MR
MOORE WAS HER ANSWER
WHEN APPLIED TO FOR ORDERS
NEVER WAS WOOER OF WEALTHY BRIDE SO
THOROUGHLY ABSOLVED FROM THE SUBALTERN PART SO INEVITABLY COMPELLED TO
ASSUME A PARAMOUNT CHARACTER
IN ALL THIS MISS KEELDAR PARTLY YIELDED TO HER DISPOSITION BUT A REMARK
SHE MADE A YEAR AFTERWARDS PROVED THAT SHE PARTLY ALSO ACTED ON SYSTEM
LOUIS SHE SAID WOULD NEVER HAVE LEARNED TO RULE IF SHE HAD NOT
CEASED TO GOVERN
THE INCAPACITY OF THE SOVEREIGN HAD DEVELOPED THE
POWERS OF THE PREMIER
IT HAD BEEN INTENDED THAT MISS HELSTONE SHOULD ACT AS BRIDESMAID AT THE
APPROACHING NUPTIALS BUT FORTUNE HAD DESTINED HER ANOTHER PART
SHE CAME HOME IN TIME TO WATER HER PLANTS
SHE HAD PERFORMED THIS LITTLE
TASK
THE LAST FLOWER ATTENDED TO WAS A ROSE TREE WHICH BLOOMED IN A
QUIET GREEN NOOK AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
THIS PLANT HAD RECEIVED THE
REFRESHING SHOWER SHE WAS NOW RESTING A MINUTE
NEAR THE WALL STOOD A
FRAGMENT OF SCULPTURED STONE A MONKISH RELIC ONCE PERHAPS THE BASE
OF A CROSS
SHE MOUNTED IT THAT SHE MIGHT BETTER COMMAND THE VIEW
SHE
HAD STILL THE WATERING POT IN ONE HAND WITH THE OTHER HER PRETTY DRESS
WAS HELD LIGHTLY ASIDE TO AVOID TRICKLING DROPS
SHE GAZED OVER THE
WALL ALONG SOME LONELY FIELDS BEYOND THREE DUSK TREES RISING SIDE BY
SIDE AGAINST THE SKY BEYOND A SOLITARY THORN AT THE HEAD OF A SOLITARY
LANE FAR OFF
SHE SURVEYED THE DUSK MOORS WHERE BONFIRES WERE KINDLING
THE SUMMER EVENING WAS WARM THE BELL MUSIC WAS JOYOUS THE BLUE SMOKE
OF THE FIRES LOOKED SOFT THEIR RED FLAME BRIGHT
ABOVE THEM IN THE SKY
WHENCE THE SUN HAD VANISHED TWINKLED A SILVER POINT THE STAR OF LOVE
CAROLINE WAS NOT UNHAPPY THAT EVENING FAR OTHERWISE BUT AS SHE GAZED
SHE SIGHED AND AS SHE SIGHED A HAND CIRCLED HER AND RESTED QUIETLY ON
HER WAIST
CAROLINE THOUGHT SHE KNEW WHO HAD DRAWN NEAR SHE RECEIVED
THE TOUCH UNSTARTLED
I AM LOOKING AT VENUS MAMMA
SEE SHE IS BEAUTIFUL
HOW WHITE HER
LUSTRE IS COMPARED WITH THE DEEP RED OF THE BONFIRES
THE ANSWER WAS A CLOSER CARESS AND CAROLINE TURNED AND LOOKED NOT
INTO MRS
PRYOR'S MATRON FACE BUT UP AT A DARK MANLY VISAGE
SHE
DROPPED HER WATERING POT AND STEPPED DOWN FROM THE PEDESTAL
I HAVE BEEN SITTING WITH 'MAMMA' AN HOUR SAID THE INTRUDER
I HAVE
HAD A LONG CONVERSATION WITH HER
WHERE MEANTIME HAVE YOU BEEN
TO FIELDHEAD
SHIRLEY IS AS NAUGHTY AS EVER ROBERT
SHE WILL NEITHER
SAY YES NOR NO TO ANY QUESTION PUT
SHE SITS ALONE
I CANNOT TELL
WHETHER SHE IS MELANCHOLY OR NONCHALANT
IF YOU ROUSE HER OR SCOLD HER
SHE GIVES YOU A LOOK HALF WISTFUL HALF RECKLESS WHICH SENDS YOU AWAY
AS QUEER AND CRAZED AS HERSELF
WHAT LOUIS WILL MAKE OF HER I CANNOT
TELL
FOR MY PART IF I WERE A GENTLEMAN I THINK I WOULD NOT DARE
UNDERTAKE HER
NEVER MIND THEM
THEY WERE CUT OUT FOR EACH OTHER
LOUIS STRANGE TO
SAY LIKES HER ALL THE BETTER FOR THESE FREAKS
HE WILL MANAGE HER IF
ANY ONE CAN
SHE TRIES HIM HOWEVER
HE HAS HAD A STORMY COURTSHIP FOR
SUCH A CALM CHARACTER BUT YOU SEE IT ALL ENDS IN VICTORY FOR HIM
CAROLINE I HAVE SOUGHT YOU TO ASK AN AUDIENCE
WHY ARE THOSE BELLS
RINGING
FOR THE REPEAL OF YOUR TERRIBLE LAW THE ORDERS YOU HATE SO MUCH
YOU
ARE PLEASED ARE YOU NOT
YESTERDAY EVENING AT THIS TIME I WAS PACKING SOME BOOKS FOR A
SEA VOYAGE
THEY WERE THE ONLY POSSESSIONS EXCEPT SOME CLOTHES SEEDS
ROOTS AND TOOLS WHICH I FELT FREE TO TAKE WITH ME TO CANADA
I WAS
GOING TO LEAVE YOU
TO LEAVE ME TO LEAVE ME
HER LITTLE FINGERS FASTENED ON HIS ARM SHE SPOKE AND LOOKED AFFRIGHTED
NOT NOW NOT NOW
EXAMINE MY FACE YES LOOK AT ME WELL
IS THE DESPAIR
OF PARTING LEGIBLE THEREON
SHE LOOKED INTO AN ILLUMINATED COUNTENANCE WHOSE CHARACTERS WERE ALL
BEAMING THOUGH THE PAGE ITSELF WAS DUSK
THIS FACE POTENT IN THE
MAJESTY OF ITS TRAITS SHED DOWN ON HER HOPE FONDNESS DELIGHT
WILL THE REPEAL DO YOU GOOD MUCH GOOD IMMEDIATE GOOD SHE
INQUIRED
THE REPEAL OF THE ORDERS IN COUNCIL SAVES ME
NOW I SHALL NOT TURN
BANKRUPT NOW I SHALL NOT GIVE UP BUSINESS NOW I SHALL NOT LEAVE
ENGLAND NOW I SHALL BE NO LONGER POOR NOW I CAN PAY MY DEBTS NOW ALL
THE CLOTH I HAVE IN MY WAREHOUSES WILL BE TAKEN OFF MY HANDS AND
COMMISSIONS GIVEN ME FOR MUCH MORE
THIS DAY LAYS FOR MY FORTUNES A
BROAD FIRM FOUNDATION ON WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I CAN
SECURELY BUILD
CAROLINE DEVOURED HIS WORDS SHE HELD HIS HAND IN HERS SHE DREW A LONG
BREATH
YOU ARE SAVED YOUR HEAVY DIFFICULTIES ARE LIFTED
THEY ARE LIFTED
I BREATHE
I CAN ACT
AT LAST OH PROVIDENCE IS KIND THANK HIM ROBERT
I DO THANK PROVIDENCE
AND I ALSO FOR YOUR SAKE SHE LOOKED UP DEVOUTLY
NOW I CAN TAKE MORE WORKMEN GIVE BETTER WAGES LAY WISER AND MORE
LIBERAL PLANS DO SOME GOOD BE LESS SELFISH
NOW CAROLINE I CAN
HAVE A HOUSE A HOME WHICH I CAN TRULY CALL MINE AND NOW
HE PAUSED FOR HIS DEEP VOICE WAS CHECKED
AND NOW HE RESUMED NOW I CAN THINK OF MARRIAGE NOW I CAN SEEK
A WIFE
THIS WAS NO MOMENT FOR HER TO SPEAK
SHE DID NOT SPEAK
WILL CAROLINE WHO MEEKLY HOPES TO BE FORGIVEN AS SHE FORGIVES WILL
SHE PARDON ALL I HAVE MADE HER SUFFER ALL THAT LONG PAIN I HAVE
WICKEDLY CAUSED HER ALL THAT SICKNESS OF BODY AND MIND SHE OWED TO ME
WILL SHE FORGET WHAT SHE KNOWS OF MY POOR AMBITION MY SORDID SCHEMES
WILL SHE LET ME EXPIATE THESE THINGS WILL SHE SUFFER ME TO PROVE THAT
AS I ONCE DESERTED CRUELLY TRIFLED WANTONLY INJURED BASELY I CAN NOW
LOVE FAITHFULLY CHERISH FONDLY TREASURE TENDERLY
HIS HAND WAS IN CAROLINE'S STILL A GENTLE PRESSURE ANSWERED HIM
IS CAROLINE MINE
CAROLINE IS YOURS
I WILL PRIZE HER
THE SENSE OF HER VALUE IS HERE IN MY HEART THE
NECESSITY FOR HER SOCIETY IS BLENDED WITH MY LIFE
NOT MORE JEALOUS
SHALL I BE OF THE BLOOD WHOSE FLOW MOVES MY PULSES THAN OF HER HAPPINESS
AND WELL BEING
I LOVE YOU TOO ROBERT AND WILL TAKE FAITHFUL CARE OF YOU
WILL YOU TAKE FAITHFUL CARE OF ME FAITHFUL CARE AS IF THAT ROSE
SHOULD PROMISE TO SHELTER FROM TEMPEST THIS HARD GRAY STONE BUT SHE
WILL CARE FOR ME IN HER WAY
THESE HANDS WILL BE THE GENTLE
MINISTRANTS OF EVERY COMFORT I CAN TASTE
I KNOW THE BEING I SEEK TO
ENTWINE WITH MY OWN WILL BRING ME A SOLACE A CHARITY A PURITY TO
WHICH OF MYSELF I AM A STRANGER
SUDDENLY CAROLINE WAS TROUBLED HER LIP QUIVERED
WHAT FLUTTERS MY DOVE ASKED MOORE AS SHE NESTLED TO AND THEN
UNEASILY SHRANK FROM HIM
POOR MAMMA I AM ALL MAMMA HAS
MUST I LEAVE HER
DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT OF THAT DIFFICULTY
I AND 'MAMMA' HAVE DISCUSSED
IT
TELL ME WHAT YOU WISH WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE AND I WILL CONSIDER IF IT
IS POSSIBLE TO CONSENT
BUT I CANNOT DESERT HER EVEN FOR YOU
I CANNOT
BREAK HER HEART EVEN FOR YOUR SAKE
SHE WAS FAITHFUL WHEN I WAS FALSE WAS SHE NOT I NEVER CAME NEAR YOUR
SICK BED AND SHE WATCHED IT CEASELESSLY
WHAT MUST I DO ANYTHING BUT LEAVE HER
AT MY WISH YOU NEVER SHALL LEAVE HER
SHE MAY LIVE VERY NEAR US
WITH US ONLY SHE WILL HAVE HER OWN ROOMS AND SERVANT
FOR THIS SHE
STIPULATES HERSELF
YOU KNOW SHE HAS AN INCOME THAT WITH HER HABITS MAKES HER QUITE
INDEPENDENT
SHE TOLD ME THAT WITH A GENTLE PRIDE THAT REMINDED ME OF SOMEBODY
ELSE
SHE IS NOT AT ALL INTERFERING AND INCAPABLE OF GOSSIP
I KNOW HER CARY
BUT IF INSTEAD OF BEING THE PERSONIFICATION OF
RESERVE AND DISCRETION SHE WERE SOMETHING QUITE OPPOSITE I SHOULD NOT
FEAR HER
YET SHE WILL BE YOUR MOTHER IN LAW THE SPEAKER GAVE AN ARCH LITTLE
NOD
MOORE SMILED
LOUIS AND I ARE NOT OF THE ORDER OF MEN WHO FEAR THEIR MOTHERS IN LAW
CARY
OUR FOES NEVER HAVE BEEN NOR WILL BE THOSE OF OUR OWN HOUSEHOLD
I DOUBT NOT MY MOTHER IN LAW WILL MAKE MUCH OF ME
THAT SHE WILL IN HER QUIET WAY YOU KNOW
SHE IS NOT DEMONSTRATIVE

DISPLEASED IT IS ONLY A MANNER SHE HAS

THE BELLS CLASH OUT AGAIN NOT ONLY THROUGH YORKSHIRE BUT
THROUGH ENGLAND
FROM SPAIN THE VOICE OF A TRUMPET HAS SOUNDED LONG IT
NOW WAXES LOUDER AND LOUDER IT PROCLAIMS SALAMANCA WON
THIS NIGHT IS
BRIARFIELD TO BE ILLUMINATED
ON THIS DAY THE FIELDHEAD TENANTRY DINE
TOGETHER THE HOLLOW'S MILL WORKPEOPLE WILL BE ASSEMBLED FOR A LIKE
FESTAL PURPOSE THE SCHOOLS HAVE A GRAND TREAT
THIS MORNING THERE WERE
TWO MARRIAGES SOLEMNIZED IN BRIARFIELD CHURCH LOUIS GRARD MOORE ESQ
LATE OF ANTWERP TO SHIRLEY DAUGHTER OF THE LATE CHARLES CAVE KEELDAR
ESQ OF FIELDHEAD ROBERT GRARD MOORE ESQ OF HOLLOW'S MILL TO
CAROLINE NIECE OF THE REV
MATTHEWSON HELSTONE M A RECTOR OF
BRIARFIELD
THE CEREMONY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WAS PERFORMED BY MR
HELSTONE
HIRAM YORKE ESQ OF BRIARMAINS GIVING THE BRIDE AWAY
IN THE SECOND
INSTANCE MR
HALL VICAR OF NUNNELY OFFICIATED
AMONGST THE BRIDAL
TRAIN THE TWO MOST NOTICEABLE PERSONAGES WERE THE YOUTHFUL BRIDESMEN
HENRY SYMPSON AND MARTIN YORKE
I SUPPOSE ROBERT MOORE'S PROPHECIES WERE PARTIALLY AT LEAST FULFILLED
THE OTHER DAY I PASSED UP THE HOLLOW WHICH TRADITION SAYS WAS ONCE
GREEN AND LONE AND WILD AND THERE I SAW THE MANUFACTURER'S DAY DREAMS
EMBODIED IN SUBSTANTIAL STONE AND BRICK AND ASHES THE CINDER BLACK
HIGHWAY THE COTTAGES AND THE COTTAGE GARDENS THERE I SAW A MIGHTY
MILL AND A CHIMNEY AMBITIOUS AS THE TOWER OF BABEL
I TOLD MY OLD
HOUSEKEEPER WHEN I CAME HOME WHERE I HAD BEEN
AY SAID SHE THIS WORLD HAS QUEER CHANGES
I CAN REMEMBER THE OLD
MILL BEING BUILT THE VERY FIRST IT WAS IN ALL THE DISTRICT AND THEN I
CAN REMEMBER IT BEING PULLED DOWN AND GOING WITH MY LAKE LASSES
COMPANIONS TO SEE THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE NEW ONE LAID
THE TWO
MR
MOORES MADE A GREAT STIR ABOUT IT
THEY WERE THERE AND A DEAL OF
FINE FOLK BESIDES AND BOTH THEIR LADIES VERY BONNY AND GRAND THEY
LOOKED
BUT MRS
LOUIS WAS THE GRANDEST SHE ALWAYS WORE SUCH HANDSOME
DRESSES
MRS
ROBERT WAS QUIETER LIKE
MRS
LOUIS SMILED WHEN SHE
TALKED
SHE HAD A REAL HAPPY GLAD GOOD NATURED LOOK BUT SHE HAD EEN
THAT PIERCED A BODY THROUGH
THERE IS NO SUCH LADIES NOWADAYS
WHAT WAS THE HOLLOW LIKE THEN MARTHA
DIFFERENT TO WHAT IT IS NOW BUT I CAN TELL OF IT CLEAN DIFFERENT
AGAIN WHEN THERE WAS NEITHER MILL NOR COT NOR HALL EXCEPT FIELDHEAD
WITHIN TWO MILES OF IT
I CAN TELL ONE SUMMER EVENING FIFTY YEARS
SYNE MY MOTHER COMING RUNNING IN JUST AT THE EDGE OF DARK ALMOST
FLEYED OUT OF HER WITS SAYING SHE HAD SEEN A FAIRISH FAIRY IN
FIELDHEAD HOLLOW AND THAT WAS THE LAST FAIRISH THAT EVER WAS SEEN ON
THIS COUNTRYSIDE THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN HEARD WITHIN THESE FORTY YEARS
A
LONESOME SPOT IT WAS AND A BONNY SPOT FULL OF OAK TREES AND NUT TREES
IT IS ALTERED NOW
THE STORY IS TOLD
I THINK I NOW SEE THE JUDICIOUS READER PUTTING ON HIS
SPECTACLES TO LOOK FOR THE MORAL
IT WOULD BE AN INSULT TO HIS SAGACITY
TO OFFER DIRECTIONS
I ONLY SAY GOD SPEED HIM IN THE QUEST

SIR WALTER SCOTT WAS AMONG THE EARLIEST TO DETECT THE MERITS OF MISS

PREFACE
THIS LITTLE BOOK WAS WRITTEN BEFORE EITHER JANE EYRE OR SHIRLEY
AND YET NO INDULGENCE CAN BE SOLICITED FOR IT ON THE PLEA OF A FIRST
ATTEMPT
A FIRST ATTEMPT IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT AS THE PEN WHICH WROTE IT
HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY WORN A GOOD DEAL IN A PRACTICE OF SOME YEARS
I HAD
NOT INDEED PUBLISHED ANYTHING BEFORE I COMMENCED THE PROFESSOR BUT
IN MANY A CRUDE EFFORT DESTROYED ALMOST AS SOON AS COMPOSED I HAD
GOT OVER ANY SUCH TASTE AS I MIGHT ONCE HAVE HAD FOR ORNAMENTED AND
REDUNDANT COMPOSITION AND COME TO PREFER WHAT WAS PLAIN AND HOMELY
AT THE SAME TIME I HAD ADOPTED A SET OF PRINCIPLES ON THE SUBJECT OF
INCIDENT C SUCH AS WOULD BE GENERALLY APPROVED IN THEORY BUT THE
RESULT OF WHICH WHEN CARRIED OUT INTO PRACTICE OFTEN PROCURES FOR AN
AUTHOR MORE SURPRISE THAN PLEASURE
I SAID TO MYSELF THAT MY HERO SHOULD WORK HIS WAY THROUGH LIFE AS I HAD
SEEN REAL LIVING MEN WORK THEIRS THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GET A SHILLING
HE HAD NOT EARNED THAT NO SUDDEN TURNS SHOULD LIFT HIM IN A MOMENT TO
WEALTH AND HIGH STATION THAT WHATEVER SMALL COMPETENCY HE MIGHT GAIN
SHOULD BE WON BY THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW THAT BEFORE HE COULD FIND SO
MUCH AS AN ARBOUR TO SIT DOWN IN HE SHOULD MASTER AT LEAST HALF THE
ASCENT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY THAT HE SHOULD NOT EVEN MARRY A
BEAUTIFUL GIRL OR A LADY OF RANK
AS ADAM'S SON HE SHOULD SHARE ADAM'S
DOOM AND DRAIN THROUGHOUT LIFE A MIXED AND MODERATE CUP OF ENJOYMENT
IN THE SEQUEL HOWEVER I FIND THAT PUBLISHERS IN GENERAL SCARCELY
APPROVED OF THIS SYSTEM BUT WOULD HAVE LIKED SOMETHING MORE IMAGINATIVE
AND POETICAL SOMETHING MORE CONSONANT WITH A HIGHLY WROUGHT FANCY WITH
A TASTE FOR PATHOS WITH SENTIMENTS MORE TENDER ELEVATED UNWORLDLY
INDEED UNTIL AN AUTHOR HAS TRIED TO DISPOSE OF A MANUSCRIPT OF THIS
KIND HE CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT STORES OF ROMANCE AND SENSIBILITY LIE
HIDDEN IN BREASTS HE WOULD NOT HAVE SUSPECTED OF CASKETING SUCH
TREASURES
MEN IN BUSINESS ARE USUALLY THOUGHT TO PREFER THE REAL ON
TRIAL THE IDEA WILL BE OFTEN FOUND FALLACIOUS A PASSIONATE PREFERENCE
FOR THE WILD WONDERFUL AND THRILLING THE STRANGE STARTLING AND
HARROWING AGITATES DIVERS SOULS THAT SHOW A CALM AND SOBER SURFACE
SUCH BEING THE CASE THE READER WILL COMPREHEND THAT TO HAVE REACHED
HIM IN THE FORM OF A PRINTED BOOK THIS BRIEF NARRATIVE MUST HAVE GONE
THROUGH SOME STRUGGLES WHICH INDEED IT HAS
AND AFTER ALL ITS
WORST STRUGGLE AND STRONGEST ORDEAL IS YET TO COME BUT IT TAKES
COMFORT SUBDUES FEAR LEANS ON THE STAFF OF A MODERATE EXPECTATION AND
MUTTERS UNDER ITS BREATH WHILE LIFTING ITS EYE TO THAT OF THE PUBLIC
HE THAT IS LOW NEED FEAR NO FALL

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTORY
THE OTHER DAY IN LOOKING OVER MY PAPERS I FOUND IN MY DESK THE
FOLLOWING COPY OF A LETTER SENT BY ME A YEAR SINCE TO AN OLD SCHOOL
ACQUAINTANCE
DEAR CHARLES
I THINK WHEN YOU AND I WERE AT ETON TOGETHER WE WERE NEITHER OF
US WHAT COULD BE CALLED POPULAR CHARACTERS YOU WERE A SARCASTIC
OBSERVANT SHREWD COLD BLOODED CREATURE MY OWN PORTRAIT I WILL
NOT ATTEMPT TO DRAW BUT I CANNOT RECOLLECT THAT IT WAS A STRIKINGLY
ATTRACTIVE ONE CAN YOU WHAT ANIMAL MAGNETISM DREW THEE AND ME TOGETHER
I KNOW NOT CERTAINLY I NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING OF THE PYLADES AND
ORESTES SENTIMENT FOR YOU AND I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ON
YOUR PART WERE EQUALLY FREE FROM ALL ROMANTIC REGARD TO ME
STILL
OUT OF SCHOOL HOURS WE WALKED AND TALKED CONTINUALLY TOGETHER WHEN THE
THEME OF CONVERSATION WAS OUR COMPANIONS OR OUR MASTERS WE UNDERSTOOD
EACH OTHER AND WHEN I RECURRED TO SOME SENTIMENT OF AFFECTION SOME
VAGUE LOVE OF AN EXCELLENT OR BEAUTIFUL OBJECT WHETHER IN ANIMATE OR
INANIMATE NATURE YOUR SARDONIC COLDNESS DID NOT MOVE ME
I FELT MYSELF
SUPERIOR TO THAT CHECK THEN AS I DO NOW
IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I WROTE TO YOU AND A STILL LONGER TIME SINCE
I SAW YOU
CHANCING TO TAKE UP A NEWSPAPER OF YOUR COUNTY THE OTHER DAY
MY EYE FELL UPON YOUR NAME
I BEGAN TO THINK OF OLD TIMES TO RUN OVER
THE EVENTS WHICH HAVE TRANSPIRED SINCE WE SEPARATED AND I SAT DOWN
AND COMMENCED THIS LETTER
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING I KNOW NOT BUT YOU
SHALL HEAR IF YOU CHOOSE TO LISTEN HOW THE WORLD HAS WAGGED WITH ME
FIRST AFTER LEAVING ETON I HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH MY MATERNAL UNCLES
LORD TYNEDALE AND THE HON
JOHN SEACOMBE
THEY ASKED ME IF I WOULD ENTER
THE CHURCH AND MY UNCLE THE NOBLEMAN OFFERED ME THE LIVING OF SEACOMBE
WHICH IS IN HIS GIFT IF I WOULD THEN MY OTHER UNCLE MR
SEACOMBE
HINTED THAT WHEN I BECAME RECTOR OF SEACOMBE CUM SCAIFE I MIGHT PERHAPS
BE ALLOWED TO TAKE AS MISTRESS OF MY HOUSE AND HEAD OF MY PARISH ONE
OF MY SIX COUSINS HIS DAUGHTERS ALL OF WHOM I GREATLY DISLIKE
I DECLINED BOTH THE CHURCH AND MATRIMONY
A GOOD CLERGYMAN IS A GOOD
THING BUT I SHOULD HAVE MADE A VERY BAD ONE
AS TO THE WIFE OH HOW
LIKE A NIGHT MARE IS THE THOUGHT OF BEING BOUND FOR LIFE TO ONE OF
MY COUSINS NO DOUBT THEY ARE ACCOMPLISHED AND PRETTY BUT NOT AN
ACCOMPLISHMENT NOT A CHARM OF THEIRS TOUCHES A CHORD IN MY BOSOM
TO THINK OF PASSING THE WINTER EVENINGS BY THE PARLOUR FIRE SIDE OF
SEACOMBE RECTORY ALONE WITH ONE OF THEM FOR INSTANCE THE LARGE AND
WELL MODELLED STATUE SARAH NO I SHOULD BE A BAD HUSBAND UNDER SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES AS WELL AS A BAD CLERGYMAN
WHEN I HAD DECLINED MY UNCLES' OFFERS THEY ASKED ME 'WHAT I INTENDED
TO DO I SAID I SHOULD REFLECT
THEY REMINDED ME THAT I HAD NO FORTUNE
AND NO EXPECTATION OF ANY AND AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE LORD
TYNEDALE DEMANDED STERNLY 'WHETHER I HAD THOUGHTS OF FOLLOWING MY
FATHER'S STEPS AND ENGAGING IN TRADE NOW I HAD HAD NO THOUGHTS OF THE
SORT
I DO NOT THINK THAT MY TURN OF MIND QUALIFIES ME TO MAKE A GOOD
TRADESMAN MY TASTE MY AMBITION DOES NOT LIE IN THAT WAY BUT SUCH WAS
THE SCORN EXPRESSED IN LORD TYNEDALE'S COUNTENANCE AS HE PRONOUNCED
THE WORD TRADE SUCH THE CONTEMPTUOUS SARCASM OF HIS TONE THAT I WAS
INSTANTLY DECIDED
MY FATHER WAS BUT A NAME TO ME YET THAT NAME I DID
NOT LIKE TO HEAR MENTIONED WITH A SNEER TO MY VERY FACE
I ANSWERED
THEN WITH HASTE AND WARMTH 'I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN FOLLOW IN
MY FATHER'S STEPS YES I WILL BE A TRADESMAN MY UNCLES DID NOT
REMONSTRATE THEY AND I PARTED WITH MUTUAL DISGUST
IN REVIEWING THIS
TRANSACTION I FIND THAT I WAS QUITE RIGHT TO SHAKE OFF THE BURDEN OF
TYNEDALE'S PATRONAGE BUT A FOOL TO OFFER MY SHOULDERS INSTANTLY FOR THE
RECEPTION OF ANOTHER BURDEN ONE WHICH MIGHT BE MORE INTOLERABLE AND
WHICH CERTAINLY WAS YET UNTRIED
I WROTE INSTANTLY TO EDWARD YOU KNOW EDWARD MY ONLY BROTHER TEN
YEARS MY SENIOR MARRIED TO A RICH MILL OWNER'S DAUGHTER AND NOW
POSSESSOR OF THE MILL AND BUSINESS WHICH WAS MY FATHER'S BEFORE HE
FAILED
YOU ARE AWARE THAT MY FATHER ONCE RECKONED A CROESUS OF
WEALTH BECAME BANKRUPT A SHORT TIME PREVIOUS TO HIS DEATH AND THAT MY
MOTHER LIVED IN DESTITUTION FOR SOME SIX MONTHS AFTER HIM UNHELPED BY
HER ARISTOCRATICAL BROTHERS WHOM SHE HAD MORTALLY OFFENDED BY HER UNION
WITH CRIMSWORTH THE SHIRE MANUFACTURER
AT THE END OF THE SIX MONTHS
SHE BROUGHT ME INTO THE WORLD AND THEN HERSELF LEFT IT WITHOUT I
SHOULD THINK MUCH REGRET AS IT CONTAINED LITTLE HOPE OR COMFORT FOR
HER
MY FATHER'S RELATIONS TOOK CHARGE OF EDWARD AS THEY DID OF ME TILL I
WAS NINE YEARS OLD
AT THAT PERIOD IT CHANCED THAT THE REPRESENTATION OF
AN IMPORTANT BOROUGH IN OUR COUNTY FELL VACANT MR
SEACOMBE STOOD FOR
IT
MY UNCLE CRIMSWORTH AN ASTUTE MERCANTILE MAN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY
OF WRITING A FIERCE LETTER TO THE CANDIDATE STATING THAT IF HE AND LORD
TYNEDALE DID NOT CONSENT TO DO SOMETHING TOWARDS THE SUPPORT OF THEIR
SISTER'S ORPHAN CHILDREN HE WOULD EXPOSE THEIR RELENTLESS AND MALIGNANT
CONDUCT TOWARDS THAT SISTER AND DO HIS BEST TO TURN THE CIRCUMSTANCES
AGAINST MR
SEACOMBE'S ELECTION
THAT GENTLEMAN AND LORD T
KNEW WELL
ENOUGH THAT THE CRIMSWORTHS WERE AN UNSCRUPULOUS AND DETERMINED RACE
THEY KNEW ALSO THAT THEY HAD INFLUENCE IN THE BOROUGH OF X AND
MAKING A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY THEY CONSENTED TO DEFRAY THE EXPENSES OF
MY EDUCATION
I WAS SENT TO ETON WHERE I REMAINED TEN YEARS DURING
WHICH SPACE OF TIME EDWARD AND I NEVER MET
HE WHEN HE GREW UP ENTERED
INTO TRADE AND PURSUED HIS CALLING WITH SUCH DILIGENCE ABILITY AND
SUCCESS THAT NOW IN HIS THIRTIETH YEAR HE WAS FAST MAKING A FORTUNE
OF THIS I WAS APPRISED BY THE OCCASIONAL SHORT LETTERS I RECEIVED FROM
HIM SOME THREE OR FOUR TIMES A YEAR WHICH SAID LETTERS NEVER CONCLUDED
WITHOUT SOME EXPRESSION OF DETERMINED ENMITY AGAINST THE HOUSE OF
SEACOMBE AND SOME REPROACH TO ME FOR LIVING AS HE SAID ON THE BOUNTY
OF THAT HOUSE
AT FIRST WHILE STILL IN BOYHOOD I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
WHY AS I HAD NO PARENTS I SHOULD NOT BE INDEBTED TO MY UNCLES TYNEDALE
AND SEACOMBE FOR MY EDUCATION BUT AS I GREW UP AND HEARD BY DEGREES OF
THE PERSEVERING HOSTILITY THE HATRED TILL DEATH EVINCED BY THEM AGAINST
MY FATHER OF THE SUFFERINGS OF MY MOTHER OF ALL THE WRONGS IN SHORT
OF OUR HOUSE THEN DID I CONCEIVE SHAME OF THE DEPENDENCE IN WHICH I
LIVED AND FORM A RESOLUTION NO MORE TO TAKE BREAD FROM HANDS WHICH HAD
REFUSED TO MINISTER TO THE NECESSITIES OF MY DYING MOTHER
IT WAS BY
THESE FEELINGS I WAS INFLUENCED WHEN I REFUSED THE RECTORY OF SEACOMBE
AND THE UNION WITH ONE OF MY PATRICIAN COUSINS
AN IRREPARABLE BREACH THUS BEING EFFECTED BETWEEN MY UNCLES AND MYSELF
I WROTE TO EDWARD TOLD HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED AND INFORMED HIM OF MY
INTENTION TO FOLLOW HIS STEPS AND BE A TRADESMAN
I ASKED MOREOVER IF
HE COULD GIVE ME EMPLOYMENT
HIS ANSWER EXPRESSED NO APPROBATION OF MY
CONDUCT BUT HE SAID I MIGHT COME DOWN TO SHIRE IF I LIKED AND HE
WOULD 'SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF FURNISHING ME WITH WORK
I REPRESSED ALL EVEN MENTAL COMMENT ON HIS NOTE PACKED MY TRUNK AND
CARPET BAG AND STARTED FOR THE NORTH DIRECTLY
AFTER TWO DAYS' TRAVELLING RAILROADS WERE NOT THEN IN EXISTENCE I
ARRIVED ONE WET OCTOBER AFTERNOON IN THE TOWN OF X
I HAD ALWAYS
UNDERSTOOD THAT EDWARD LIVED IN THIS TOWN BUT ON INQUIRY I FOUND THAT
IT WAS ONLY MR
CRIMSWORTH'S MILL AND WAREHOUSE WHICH WERE SITUATED IN
THE SMOKY ATMOSPHERE OF BIGBEN CLOSE HIS RESIDENCE LAY FOUR MILES OUT
IN THE COUNTRY
IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN I ALIGHTED AT THE GATES OF THE
HABITATION DESIGNATED TO ME AS MY BROTHER'S
AS I ADVANCED UP THE
AVENUE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE SHADES OF TWILIGHT AND THE DARK GLOOMY
MISTS WHICH DEEPENED THOSE SHADES THAT THE HOUSE WAS LARGE AND THE
GROUNDS SURROUNDING IT SUFFICIENTLY SPACIOUS
I PAUSED A MOMENT ON THE
LAWN IN FRONT AND LEANING MY BACK AGAINST A TALL TREE WHICH ROSE IN THE
CENTRE I GAZED WITH INTEREST ON THE EXTERIOR OF CRIMSWORTH HALL
EDWARD IS RICH THOUGHT I TO MYSELF
'I BELIEVED HIM TO BE DOING
WELL BUT I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS MASTER OF A MANSION LIKE THIS CUTTING
SHORT ALL MARVELLING SPECULATION CONJECTURE C I ADVANCED TO THE
FRONT DOOR AND RANG
A MAN SERVANT OPENED IT I ANNOUNCED MYSELF HE
RELIEVED ME OF MY WET CLOAK AND CARPET BAG AND USHERED ME INTO A
ROOM FURNISHED AS A LIBRARY WHERE THERE WAS A BRIGHT FIRE AND CANDLES
BURNING ON THE TABLE HE INFORMED ME THAT HIS MASTER WAS NOT YET
RETURNED FROM X MARKET BUT THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE AT HOME IN THE
COURSE OF HALF AN HOUR
BEING LEFT TO MYSELF I TOOK THE STUFFED EASY CHAIR COVERED WITH RED
MOROCCO WHICH STOOD BY THE FIRESIDE AND WHILE MY EYES WATCHED THE
FLAMES DART FROM THE GLOWING COALS AND THE CINDERS FALL AT INTERVALS ON
THE HEARTH MY MIND BUSIED ITSELF IN CONJECTURES CONCERNING THE MEETING
ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE
AMIDST MUCH THAT WAS DOUBTFUL IN THE SUBJECT OF
THESE CONJECTURES THERE WAS ONE THING TOLERABLY CERTAIN I WAS IN NO
DANGER OF ENCOUNTERING SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT FROM THIS THE MODERATION
OF MY EXPECTATIONS GUARANTEED ME
I ANTICIPATED NO OVERFLOWINGS OF
FRATERNAL TENDERNESS EDWARD'S LETTERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN SUCH AS TO
PREVENT THE ENGENDERING OR HARBOURING OF DELUSIONS OF THIS SORT
STILL
AS I SAT AWAITING HIS ARRIVAL I FELT EAGER VERY EAGER I CANNOT TELL
YOU WHY MY HAND SO UTTERLY A STRANGER TO THE GRASP OF A KINDRED HAND
CLENCHED ITSELF TO REPRESS THE TREMOR WITH WHICH IMPATIENCE WOULD FAIN
HAVE SHAKEN IT
I THOUGHT OF MY UNCLES AND AS I WAS ENGAGED IN WONDERING WHETHER
EDWARD'S INDIFFERENCE WOULD EQUAL THE COLD DISDAIN I HAD ALWAYS
EXPERIENCED FROM THEM I HEARD THE AVENUE GATES OPEN WHEELS APPROACHED
THE HOUSE MR
CRIMSWORTH WAS ARRIVED AND AFTER THE LAPSE OF SOME
MINUTES AND A BRIEF DIALOGUE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS SERVANT IN THE
HALL HIS TREAD DREW NEAR THE LIBRARY DOOR THAT TREAD ALONE ANNOUNCED
THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE
I STILL RETAINED SOME CONFUSED RECOLLECTION OF EDWARD AS HE WAS TEN
YEARS AGO A TALL WIRY RAW YOUTH NOW AS I ROSE FROM MY SEAT AND
TURNED TOWARDS THE LIBRARY DOOR I SAW A FINE LOOKING AND POWERFUL MAN
LIGHT COMPLEXIONED WELL MADE AND OF ATHLETIC PROPORTIONS THE FIRST
GLANCE MADE ME AWARE OF AN AIR OF PROMPTITUDE AND SHARPNESS SHOWN
AS WELL IN HIS MOVEMENTS AS IN HIS PORT HIS EYE AND THE GENERAL
EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE
HE GREETED ME WITH BREVITY AND IN THE MOMENT
OF SHAKING HANDS SCANNED ME FROM HEAD TO FOOT HE TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE
MOROCCO COVERED ARM CHAIR AND MOTIONED ME TO ANOTHER SEAT
'I EXPECTED YOU WOULD HAVE CALLED AT THE COUNTING HOUSE IN THE CLOSE
SAID HE AND HIS VOICE I NOTICED HAD AN ABRUPT ACCENT PROBABLY
HABITUAL TO HIM HE SPOKE ALSO WITH A GUTTURAL NORTHERN TONE WHICH
SOUNDED HARSH IN MY EARS ACCUSTOMED TO THE SILVERY UTTERANCE OF THE
SOUTH
'THE LANDLORD OF THE INN WHERE THE COACH STOPPED DIRECTED ME HERE
SAID I
'I DOUBTED AT FIRST THE ACCURACY OF HIS INFORMATION NOT BEING
AWARE THAT YOU HAD SUCH A RESIDENCE AS THIS
'OH IT IS ALL RIGHT HE REPLIED 'ONLY I WAS KEPT HALF AN HOUR BEHIND
TIME WAITING FOR YOU THAT IS ALL
I THOUGHT YOU MUST BE COMING BY THE
EIGHT O'CLOCK COACH
I EXPRESSED REGRET THAT HE HAD HAD TO WAIT HE MADE NO ANSWER BUT
STIRRED THE FIRE AS IF TO COVER A MOVEMENT OF IMPATIENCE THEN HE
SCANNED ME AGAIN
I FELT AN INWARD SATISFACTION THAT I HAD NOT IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF
MEETING BETRAYED ANY WARMTH ANY ENTHUSIASM THAT I HAD SALUTED THIS
MAN WITH A QUIET AND STEADY PHLEGM
'HAVE YOU QUITE BROKEN WITH TYNEDALE AND SEACOMBE HE ASKED HASTILY
'I DO NOT THINK I SHALL HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMUNICATION WITH THEM MY
REFUSAL OF THEIR PROPOSALS WILL I FANCY OPERATE AS A BARRIER AGAINST
ALL FUTURE INTERCOURSE
'WHY SAID HE 'I MAY AS WELL REMIND YOU AT THE VERY OUTSET OF OUR
CONNECTION THAT NO MAN CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS ACQUAINTANCE WITH LORD
TYNEDALE WILL BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ASSISTANCE FROM ME THERE WAS A KIND
OF GRATUITOUS MENACE IN HIS EYE AS HE LOOKED AT ME IN FINISHING THIS
OBSERVATION
FEELING NO DISPOSITION TO REPLY TO HIM I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH AN
INWARD SPECULATION ON THE DIFFERENCES WHICH EXIST IN THE CONSTITUTION
OF MEN'S MINDS
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT INFERENCE MR
CRIMSWORTH DREW FROM
MY SILENCE WHETHER HE CONSIDERED IT A SYMPTOM OF CONTUMACITY OR AN
EVIDENCE OF MY BEING COWED BY HIS PEREMPTORY MANNER
AFTER A LONG AND
HARD STARE AT ME HE ROSE SHARPLY FROM HIS SEAT
'TO MORROW SAID HE 'I SHALL CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO SOME OTHER
POINTS BUT NOW IT IS SUPPER TIME AND MRS
CRIMSWORTH IS PROBABLY
WAITING WILL YOU COME
HE STRODE FROM THE ROOM AND I FOLLOWED
IN CROSSING THE HALL I
WONDERED WHAT MRS
CRIMSWORTH MIGHT BE
'IS SHE THOUGHT I 'AS ALIEN
TO WHAT I LIKE AS TYNEDALE SEACOMBE THE MISSES SEACOMBE AS THE
AFFECTIONATE RELATIVE NOW STRIDING BEFORE ME OR IS SHE BETTER THAN
THESE SHALL I IN CONVERSING WITH HER FEEL FREE TO SHOW SOMETHING OF
MY REAL NATURE OR FURTHER CONJECTURES WERE ARRESTED BY MY ENTRANCE
INTO THE DINING ROOM
A LAMP BURNING UNDER A SHADE OF GROUND GLASS SHOWED A HANDSOME
APARTMENT WAINSCOTED WITH OAK SUPPER WAS LAID ON THE TABLE BY THE
FIRE PLACE STANDING AS IF WAITING OUR ENTRANCE APPEARED A LADY
SHE WAS YOUNG TALL AND WELL SHAPED HER DRESS WAS HANDSOME AND
FASHIONABLE SO MUCH MY FIRST GLANCE SUFFICED TO ASCERTAIN
A GAY
SALUTATION PASSED BETWEEN HER AND MR
CRIMSWORTH SHE CHID HIM HALF
PLAYFULLY HALF POUTINGLY FOR BEING LATE HER VOICE I ALWAYS TAKE
VOICES INTO THE ACCOUNT IN JUDGING OF CHARACTER WAS LIVELY IT
INDICATED I THOUGHT GOOD ANIMAL SPIRITS
MR
CRIMSWORTH SOON CHECKED
HER ANIMATED SCOLDING WITH A KISS A KISS THAT STILL TOLD OF THE
BRIDEGROOM THEY HAD NOT YET BEEN MARRIED A YEAR SHE TOOK HER SEAT
AT THE SUPPER TABLE IN FIRST RATE SPIRITS
PERCEIVING ME SHE BEGGED
MY PARDON FOR NOT NOTICING ME BEFORE AND THEN SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AS
LADIES DO WHEN A FLOW OF GOOD HUMOUR DISPOSES THEM TO BE CHEERFUL TO
ALL EVEN THE MOST INDIFFERENT OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
IT WAS NOW FURTHER
OBVIOUS TO ME THAT SHE HAD A GOOD COMPLEXION AND FEATURES SUFFICIENTLY
MARKED BUT AGREEABLE HER HAIR WAS RED QUITE RED
SHE AND EDWARD
TALKED MUCH ALWAYS IN A VEIN OF PLAYFUL CONTENTION SHE WAS VEXED OR
PRETENDED TO BE VEXED THAT HE HAD THAT DAY DRIVEN A VICIOUS HORSE IN
THE GIG AND HE MADE LIGHT OF HER FEARS
SOMETIMES SHE APPEALED TO ME
'NOW MR
WILLIAM ISN'T IT ABSURD IN EDWARD TO TALK SO HE SAYS HE
WILL DRIVE JACK AND NO OTHER HORSE AND THE BRUTE HAS THROWN HIM TWICE
ALREADY
SHE SPOKE WITH A KIND OF LISP NOT DISAGREEABLE BUT CHILDISH
I
SOON SAW ALSO THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN GIRLISH A SOMEWHAT INFANTINE
EXPRESSION IN HER BY NO MEANS SMALL FEATURES THIS LISP AND EXPRESSION
WERE I HAVE NO DOUBT A CHARM IN EDWARD'S EYES AND WOULD BE SO TO
THOSE OF MOST MEN BUT THEY WERE NOT TO MINE
I SOUGHT HER EYE DESIROUS
TO READ THERE THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH I COULD NOT DISCERN IN HER FACE
OR HEAR IN HER CONVERSATION IT WAS MERRY RATHER SMALL BY TURNS I SAW
VIVACITY VANITY COQUETRY LOOK OUT THROUGH ITS IRID BUT I WATCHED IN
VAIN FOR A GLIMPSE OF SOUL
I AM NO ORIENTAL WHITE NECKS CARMINE LIPS
AND CHEEKS CLUSTERS OF BRIGHT CURLS DO NOT SUFFICE FOR ME WITHOUT THAT
PROMETHEAN SPARK WHICH WILL LIVE AFTER THE ROSES AND LILIES ARE FADED
THE BURNISHED HAIR GROWN GREY
IN SUNSHINE IN PROSPERITY THE FLOWERS
ARE VERY WELL BUT HOW MANY WET DAYS ARE THERE IN LIFE NOVEMBER SEASONS
OF DISASTER WHEN A MAN'S HEARTH AND HOME WOULD BE COLD INDEED WITHOUT
THE CLEAR CHEERING GLEAM OF INTELLECT
HAVING PERUSED THE FAIR PAGE OF MRS
CRIMSWORTH'S FACE A DEEP
INVOLUNTARY SIGH ANNOUNCED MY DISAPPOINTMENT SHE TOOK IT AS A HOMAGE TO
HER BEAUTY AND EDWARD WHO WAS EVIDENTLY PROUD OF HIS RICH AND HANDSOME
YOUNG WIFE THREW ON ME A GLANCE HALF RIDICULE HALF IRE
I TURNED FROM THEM BOTH AND GAZING WEARILY ROUND THE ROOM I SAW TWO
PICTURES SET IN THE OAK PANELLING ONE ON EACH SIDE THE MANTEL PIECE
CEASING TO TAKE PART IN THE BANTERING CONVERSATION THAT FLOWED ON
BETWEEN MR
AND MRS
CRIMSWORTH I BENT MY THOUGHTS TO THE EXAMINATION
OF THESE PICTURES
THEY WERE PORTRAITS A LADY AND A GENTLEMAN BOTH
COSTUMED IN THE FASHION OF TWENTY YEARS AGO
THE GENTLEMAN WAS IN THE
SHADE
I COULD NOT SEE HIM WELL
THE LADY HAD THE BENEFIT OF A FULL BEAM
FROM THE SOFTLY SHADED LAMP
I PRESENTLY RECOGNISED HER I HAD SEEN THIS
PICTURE BEFORE IN CHILDHOOD IT WAS MY MOTHER THAT AND THE COMPANION
PICTURE BEING THE ONLY HEIR LOOMS SAVED OUT OF THE SALE OF MY FATHER'S
PROPERTY
THE FACE I REMEMBERED HAD PLEASED ME AS A BOY BUT THEN I DID NOT
UNDERSTAND IT NOW I KNEW HOW RARE THAT CLASS OF FACE IS IN THE WORLD
AND I APPRECIATED KEENLY ITS THOUGHTFUL YET GENTLE EXPRESSION
THE
SERIOUS GREY EYE POSSESSED FOR ME A STRONG CHARM AS DID CERTAIN LINES
IN THE FEATURES INDICATIVE OF MOST TRUE AND TENDER FEELING
I WAS SORRY
IT WAS ONLY A PICTURE
I SOON LEFT MR
AND MRS
CRIMSWORTH TO THEMSELVES A SERVANT
CONDUCTED ME TO MY BED ROOM IN CLOSING MY CHAMBER DOOR I SHUT OUT ALL
INTRUDERS YOU CHARLES AS WELL AS THE REST
GOOD BYE FOR THE PRESENT
WILLIAM CRIMSWORTH
TO THIS LETTER I NEVER GOT AN ANSWER BEFORE MY OLD FRIEND RECEIVED IT
HE HAD ACCEPTED A GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENT IN ONE OF THE COLONIES AND WAS
ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO THE SCENE OF HIS OFFICIAL LABOURS
WHAT HAS BECOME
OF HIM SINCE I KNOW NOT
THE LEISURE TIME I HAVE AT COMMAND AND WHICH I INTENDED TO EMPLOY
FOR HIS PRIVATE BENEFIT I SHALL NOW DEDICATE TO THAT OF THE PUBLIC AT
LARGE
MY NARRATIVE IS NOT EXCITING AND ABOVE ALL NOT MARVELLOUS
BUT IT MAY INTEREST SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVING TOILED IN THE SAME
VOCATION AS MYSELF WILL FIND IN MY EXPERIENCE FREQUENT REFLECTIONS
OF THEIR OWN
THE ABOVE LETTER WILL SERVE AS AN INTRODUCTION
I NOW
PROCEED
CHAPTER II
A FINE OCTOBER MORNING SUCCEEDED TO THE FOGGY EVENING THAT HAD WITNESSED
MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO CRIMSWORTH HALL
I WAS EARLY UP AND WALKING IN
THE LARGE PARK LIKE MEADOW SURROUNDING THE HOUSE
THE AUTUMN SUN RISING
OVER THE SHIRE HILLS DISCLOSED A PLEASANT COUNTRY WOODS BROWN AND
MELLOW VARIED THE FIELDS FROM WHICH THE HARVEST HAD BEEN LATELY CARRIED
A RIVER GLIDING BETWEEN THE WOODS CAUGHT ON ITS SURFACE THE SOMEWHAT
COLD GLEAM OF THE OCTOBER SUN AND SKY AT FREQUENT INTERVALS ALONG THE
BANKS OF THE RIVER TALL CYLINDRICAL CHIMNEYS ALMOST LIKE SLENDER
ROUND TOWERS INDICATED THE FACTORIES WHICH THE TREES HALF CONCEALED
HERE AND THERE MANSIONS SIMILAR TO CRIMSWORTH HALL OCCUPIED AGREEABLE
SITES ON THE HILL SIDE THE COUNTRY WORE ON THE WHOLE A CHEERFUL
ACTIVE FERTILE LOOK
STEAM TRADE MACHINERY HAD LONG BANISHED FROM
IT ALL ROMANCE AND SECLUSION
AT A DISTANCE OF FIVE MILES A VALLEY
OPENING BETWEEN THE LOW HILLS HELD IN ITS CUPS THE GREAT TOWN OF X
A DENSE PERMANENT VAPOUR BROODED OVER THIS LOCALITY THERE LAY EDWARD'S
CONCERN
I FORCED MY EYE TO SCRUTINIZE THIS PROSPECT I FORCED MY MIND TO DWELL
ON IT FOR A TIME AND WHEN I FOUND THAT IT COMMUNICATED NO PLEASURABLE
EMOTION TO MY HEART THAT IT STIRRED IN ME NONE OF THE HOPES A MAN OUGHT
TO FEEL WHEN HE SEES LAID BEFORE HIM THE SCENE OF HIS LIFE'S CAREER I
SAID TO MYSELF WILLIAM YOU ARE A REBEL AGAINST CIRCUMSTANCES YOU ARE
A FOOL AND KNOW NOT WHAT YOU WANT YOU HAVE CHOSEN TRADE AND YOU SHALL
BE A TRADESMAN
LOOK I CONTINUED MENTALLY LOOK AT THE SOOTY SMOKE IN
THAT HOLLOW AND KNOW THAT THERE IS YOUR POST THERE YOU CANNOT DREAM
YOU CANNOT SPECULATE AND THEORIZE THERE YOU SHALL OUT AND WORK
THUS SELF SCHOOLED I RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
MY BROTHER WAS IN THE
BREAKFAST ROOM
I MET HIM COLLECTEDLY I COULD NOT MEET HIM CHEERFULLY
HE WAS STANDING ON THE RUG HIS BACK TO THE FIRE HOW MUCH DID I READ IN
THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE AS MY GLANCE ENCOUNTERED HIS WHEN I ADVANCED
TO BID HIM GOOD MORNING HOW MUCH THAT WAS CONTRADICTORY TO MY NATURE
HE SAID GOOD MORNING ABRUPTLY AND NODDED AND THEN HE SNATCHED RATHER
THAN TOOK A NEWSPAPER FROM THE TABLE AND BEGAN TO READ IT WITH THE AIR
OF A MASTER WHO SEIZES A PRETEXT TO ESCAPE THE BORE OF CONVERSING WITH
AN UNDERLING
IT WAS WELL I HAD TAKEN A RESOLUTION TO ENDURE FOR A TIME
OR HIS MANNER WOULD HAVE GONE FAR TO RENDER INSUPPORTABLE THE DISGUST
I HAD JUST BEEN ENDEAVOURING TO SUBDUE
I LOOKED AT HIM I MEASURED HIS
ROBUST FRAME AND POWERFUL PROPORTIONS I SAW MY OWN REFLECTION IN THE
MIRROR OVER THE MANTEL PIECE I AMUSED MYSELF WITH COMPARING THE TWO
PICTURES
IN FACE I RESEMBLED HIM THOUGH I WAS NOT SO HANDSOME MY
FEATURES WERE LESS REGULAR I HAD A DARKER EYE AND A BROADER BROW IN
FORM I WAS GREATLY INFERIOR THINNER SLIGHTER NOT SO TALL
AS AN
ANIMAL EDWARD EXCELLED ME FAR SHOULD HE PROVE AS PARAMOUNT IN MIND
AS IN PERSON I MUST BE A SLAVE FOR I MUST EXPECT FROM HIM NO LION LIKE
GENEROSITY TO ONE WEAKER THAN HIMSELF HIS COLD AVARICIOUS EYE HIS
STERN FORBIDDING MANNER TOLD ME HE WOULD NOT SPARE
HAD I THEN FORCE OF
MIND TO COPE WITH HIM I DID NOT KNOW I HAD NEVER BEEN TRIED
MRS
CRIMSWORTH'S ENTRANCE DIVERTED MY THOUGHTS FOR A MOMENT
SHE LOOKED
WELL DRESSED IN WHITE HER FACE AND HER ATTIRE SHINING IN MORNING
AND BRIDAL FRESHNESS
I ADDRESSED HER WITH THE DEGREE OF EASE HER LAST
NIGHT'S CARELESS GAIETY SEEMED TO WARRANT BUT SHE REPLIED WITH COOLNESS
AND RESTRAINT HER HUSBAND HAD TUTORED HER SHE WAS NOT TO BE TOO
FAMILIAR WITH HIS CLERK
AS SOON AS BREAKFAST WAS OVER MR
CRIMSWORTH INTIMATED TO ME THAT THEY
WERE BRINGING THE GIG ROUND TO THE DOOR AND THAT IN FIVE MINUTES HE
SHOULD EXPECT ME TO BE READY TO GO DOWN WITH HIM TO X
I DID NOT
KEEP HIM WAITING WE WERE SOON DASHING AT A RAPID RATE ALONG THE
ROAD
THE HORSE HE DROVE WAS THE SAME VICIOUS ANIMAL ABOUT WHICH MRS
CRIMSWORTH HAD EXPRESSED HER FEARS THE NIGHT BEFORE
ONCE OR TWICE
JACK SEEMED DISPOSED TO TURN RESTIVE BUT A VIGOROUS AND DETERMINED
APPLICATION OF THE WHIP FROM THE RUTHLESS HAND OF HIS MASTER SOON
COMPELLED HIM TO SUBMISSION AND EDWARD'S DILATED NOSTRIL EXPRESSED HIS
TRIUMPH IN THE RESULT OF THE CONTEST HE SCARCELY SPOKE TO ME DURING THE
WHOLE OF THE BRIEF DRIVE ONLY OPENING HIS LIPS AT INTERVALS TO DAMN HIS
HORSE
X WAS ALL STIR AND BUSTLE WHEN WE ENTERED IT WE LEFT THE CLEAN
STREETS WHERE THERE WERE DWELLING HOUSES AND SHOPS CHURCHES AND PUBLIC
BUILDINGS WE LEFT ALL THESE AND TURNED DOWN TO A REGION OF MILLS AND
WAREHOUSES THENCE WE PASSED THROUGH TWO MASSIVE GATES INTO A GREAT
PAVED YARD AND WE WERE IN BIGBEN CLOSE AND THE MILL WAS BEFORE US
VOMITING SOOT FROM ITS LONG CHIMNEY AND QUIVERING THROUGH ITS THICK
BRICK WALLS WITH THE COMMOTION OF ITS IRON BOWELS
WORKPEOPLE WERE
PASSING TO AND FRO A WAGGON WAS BEING LADEN WITH PIECES
MR
CRIMSWORTH
LOOKED FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND SEEMED AT ONE GLANCE TO COMPREHEND ALL
THAT WAS GOING ON HE ALIGHTED AND LEAVING HIS HORSE AND GIG TO THE
CARE OF A MAN WHO HASTENED TO TAKE THE REINS FROM HIS HAND HE BID ME
FOLLOW HIM TO THE COUNTING HOUSE
WE ENTERED IT A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE
FROM THE PARLOURS OF CRIMSWORTH HALL A PLACE FOR BUSINESS WITH A BARE
PLANKED FLOOR A SAFE TWO HIGH DESKS AND STOOLS AND SOME CHAIRS
A
PERSON WAS SEATED AT ONE OF THE DESKS WHO TOOK OFF HIS SQUARE CAP WHEN
MR
CRIMSWORTH ENTERED AND IN AN INSTANT WAS AGAIN ABSORBED IN HIS
OCCUPATION OF WRITING OR CALCULATING I KNOW NOT WHICH
MR
CRIMSWORTH HAVING REMOVED HIS MACKINTOSH SAT DOWN BY THE FIRE
I
REMAINED STANDING NEAR THE HEARTH HE SAID PRESENTLY
STEIGHTON YOU MAY LEAVE THE ROOM I HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO TRANSACT
WITH THIS GENTLEMAN
COME BACK WHEN YOU HEAR THE BELL
THE INDIVIDUAL AT THE DESK ROSE AND DEPARTED CLOSING THE DOOR AS HE
WENT OUT
MR
CRIMSWORTH STIRRED THE FIRE THEN FOLDED HIS ARMS AND SAT
A MOMENT THINKING HIS LIPS COMPRESSED HIS BROW KNIT
I HAD NOTHING TO
DO BUT TO WATCH HIM HOW WELL HIS FEATURES WERE CUT WHAT A HANDSOME MAN
HE WAS WHENCE THEN CAME THAT AIR OF CONTRACTION THAT NARROW AND HARD
ASPECT ON HIS FOREHEAD IN ALL HIS LINEAMENTS
TURNING TO ME HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY
YOU ARE COME DOWN TO SHIRE TO LEARN TO BE A TRADESMAN
YES I AM
HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND ON THE POINT LET ME KNOW THAT AT ONCE
YES
WELL I AM NOT BOUND TO HELP YOU BUT I HAVE A PLACE HERE VACANT IF
YOU ARE QUALIFIED FOR IT
I WILL TAKE YOU ON TRIAL
WHAT CAN YOU DO DO
YOU KNOW ANYTHING BESIDES THAT USELESS TRASH OF COLLEGE LEARNING GREEK
LATIN AND SO FORTH
I HAVE STUDIED MATHEMATICS
STUFF I DARE SAY YOU HAVE
I CAN READ AND WRITE FRENCH AND GERMAN
HUM HE REFLECTED A MOMENT THEN OPENING A DRAWER IN A DESK NEAR HIM
TOOK OUT A LETTER AND GAVE IT TO ME
CAN YOU READ THAT HE ASKED
IT WAS A GERMAN COMMERCIAL LETTER I TRANSLATED IT I COULD NOT TELL
WHETHER HE WAS GRATIFIED OR NOT HIS COUNTENANCE REMAINED FIXED
IT IS WELL HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE THAT YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH
SOMETHING USEFUL SOMETHING THAT MAY ENABLE YOU TO EARN YOUR BOARD AND
LODGING SINCE YOU KNOW FRENCH AND GERMAN I WILL TAKE YOU AS SECOND
CLERK TO MANAGE THE FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HOUSE
I SHALL GIVE
YOU A GOOD SALARY 90L
A YEAR AND NOW HE CONTINUED RAISING HIS
VOICE HEAR ONCE FOR ALL WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP AND
ALL THAT SORT OF HUMBUG I MUST HAVE NO NONSENSE ON THAT POINT IT
WOULD NEVER SUIT ME
I SHALL EXCUSE YOU NOTHING ON THE PLEA OF BEING MY
BROTHER IF I FIND YOU STUPID NEGLIGENT DISSIPATED IDLE OR POSSESSED
OF ANY FAULTS DETRIMENTAL TO THE INTERESTS OF THE HOUSE I SHALL DISMISS
YOU AS I WOULD ANY OTHER CLERK
NINETY POUNDS A YEAR ARE GOOD WAGES AND
I EXPECT TO HAVE THE FULL VALUE OF MY MONEY OUT OF YOU REMEMBER
TOO THAT THINGS ARE ON A PRACTICAL FOOTING IN MY
ESTABLISHMENT BUSINESS LIKE HABITS FEELINGS AND IDEAS SUIT ME BEST
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
PARTLY I REPLIED
I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN THAT I AM TO DO MY WORK FOR MY
WAGES NOT TO EXPECT FAVOUR FROM YOU AND NOT TO DEPEND ON YOU FOR ANY
HELP BUT WHAT I EARN THAT SUITS ME EXACTLY AND ON THESE TERMS I WILL
CONSENT TO BE YOUR CLERK
I TURNED ON MY HEEL AND WALKED TO THE WINDOW THIS TIME I DID NOT
CONSULT HIS FACE TO LEARN HIS OPINION WHAT IT WAS I DO NOT KNOW NOR
DID I THEN CARE
AFTER A SILENCE OF SOME MINUTES HE RECOMMENCED
YOU PERHAPS EXPECT TO BE ACCOMMODATED WITH APARTMENTS AT CRIMSWORTH
HALL AND TO GO AND COME WITH ME IN THE GIG
I WISH YOU HOWEVER TO BE
AWARE THAT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE QUITE INCONVENIENT TO ME
I
LIKE TO HAVE THE SEAT IN MY GIG AT LIBERTY FOR ANY GENTLEMAN WHOM FOR
BUSINESS REASONS I MAY WISH TO TAKE DOWN TO THE HALL FOR A NIGHT OR SO
YOU WILL SEEK OUT LODGINGS IN X
QUITTING THE WINDOW I WALKED BACK TO THE HEARTH
OF COURSE I SHALL SEEK OUT LODGINGS IN X I ANSWERED
IT WOULD
NOT SUIT ME EITHER TO LODGE AT CRIMSWORTH HALL
MY TONE WAS QUIET
I ALWAYS SPEAK QUIETLY
YET MR
CRIMSWORTH'S BLUE EYE
BECAME INCENSED HE TOOK HIS REVENGE RATHER ODDLY
TURNING TO ME HE SAID
BLUNTLY
YOU ARE POOR ENOUGH I SUPPOSE HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO LIVE TILL YOUR
QUARTER'S SALARY BECOMES DUE
I SHALL GET ON SAID I
HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO LIVE HE REPEATED IN A LOUDER VOICE
AS I CAN MR
CRIMSWORTH
GET INTO DEBT AT YOUR PERIL THAT'S ALL HE ANSWERED
FOR AUGHT I
KNOW YOU MAY HAVE EXTRAVAGANT ARISTOCRATIC HABITS IF YOU HAVE DROP
THEM I TOLERATE NOTHING OF THE SORT HERE AND I WILL NEVER GIVE YOU A
SHILLING EXTRA WHATEVER LIABILITIES YOU MAY INCUR MIND THAT
YES MR
CRIMSWORTH YOU WILL FIND I HAVE A GOOD MEMORY
I SAID NO MORE
I DID NOT THINK THE TIME WAS COME FOR MUCH PARLEY
I
HAD AN INSTINCTIVE FEELING THAT IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO LET ONE'S TEMPER
EFFERVESCE OFTEN WITH SUCH A MAN AS EDWARD
I SAID TO MYSELF I WILL
PLACE MY CUP UNDER THIS CONTINUAL DROPPING IT SHALL STAND THERE STILL
AND STEADY WHEN FULL IT WILL RUN OVER OF ITSELF MEANTIME PATIENCE
TWO THINGS ARE CERTAIN
I AM CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE WORK MR
CRIMSWORTH HAS SET ME I CAN EARN MY WAGES CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND THOSE
WAGES ARE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE ME TO LIVE
AS TO THE FACT OF MY BROTHER
ASSUMING TOWARDS ME THE BEARING OF A PROUD HARSH MASTER THE FAULT IS
HIS NOT MINE AND SHALL HIS INJUSTICE HIS BAD FEELING TURN ME AT ONCE
ASIDE FROM THE PATH I HAVE CHOSEN NO AT LEAST ERE I DEVIATE I WILL
ADVANCE FAR ENOUGH TO SEE WHITHER MY CAREER TENDS
AS YET I AM ONLY
PRESSING IN AT THE ENTRANCE A STRAIT GATE ENOUGH IT OUGHT TO HAVE A
GOOD TERMINUS WHILE I THUS REASONED MR
CRIMSWORTH RANG A BELL HIS
FIRST CLERK THE INDIVIDUAL DISMISSED PREVIOUSLY TO OUR CONFERENCE
RE ENTERED
MR
STEIGHTON SAID HE SHOW MR
WILLIAM THE LETTERS FROM VOSS
BROTHERS AND GIVE HIM ENGLISH COPIES OF THE ANSWERS HE WILL TRANSLATE
THEM
MR
STEIGHTON A MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY FIVE WITH A FACE AT ONCE SLY AND
HEAVY HASTENED TO EXECUTE THIS ORDER HE LAID THE LETTERS ON THE
DESK AND I WAS SOON SEATED AT IT AND ENGAGED IN RENDERING THE ENGLISH
ANSWERS INTO GERMAN
A SENTIMENT OF KEEN PLEASURE ACCOMPANIED THIS FIRST
EFFORT TO EARN MY OWN LIVING A SENTIMENT NEITHER POISONED NOR WEAKENED
BY THE PRESENCE OF THE TASKMASTER WHO STOOD AND WATCHED ME FOR SOME
TIME AS I WROTE
I THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING TO READ MY CHARACTER BUT I
FELT AS SECURE AGAINST HIS SCRUTINY AS IF I HAD HAD ON A CASQUE WITH THE
VISOR DOWN OR RATHER I SHOWED HIM MY COUNTENANCE WITH THE CONFIDENCE
THAT ONE WOULD SHOW AN UNLEARNED MAN A LETTER WRITTEN IN GREEK HE MIGHT
SEE LINES AND TRACE CHARACTERS BUT HE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THEM MY
NATURE WAS NOT HIS NATURE AND ITS SIGNS WERE TO HIM LIKE THE WORDS OF
AN UNKNOWN TONGUE
ERE LONG HE TURNED AWAY ABRUPTLY AS IF BAFFLED AND
LEFT THE COUNTING HOUSE HE RETURNED TO IT BUT TWICE IN THE COURSE OF
THAT DAY EACH TIME HE MIXED AND SWALLOWED A GLASS OF BRANDY AND WATER
THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING WHICH HE EXTRACTED FROM A CUPBOARD ON ONE SIDE
OF THE FIREPLACE HAVING GLANCED AT MY TRANSLATIONS HE COULD READ BOTH
FRENCH AND GERMAN HE WENT OUT AGAIN IN SILENCE
CHAPTER III
I SERVED EDWARD AS HIS SECOND CLERK FAITHFULLY PUNCTUALLY DILIGENTLY
WHAT WAS GIVEN ME TO DO I HAD THE POWER AND THE DETERMINATION TO DO
WELL
MR
CRIMSWORTH WATCHED SHARPLY FOR DEFECTS BUT FOUND NONE HE SET
TIMOTHY STEIGHTON HIS FAVOURITE AND HEAD MAN TO WATCH ALSO
TIM WAS
BAFFLED I WAS AS EXACT AS HIMSELF AND QUICKER
MR
CRIMSWORTH MADE
INQUIRIES AS TO HOW I LIVED WHETHER I GOT INTO DEBT NO MY ACCOUNTS
WITH MY LANDLADY WERE ALWAYS STRAIGHT
I HAD HIRED SMALL LODGINGS WHICH
I CONTRIVED TO PAY FOR OUT OF A SLENDER FUND THE ACCUMULATED SAVINGS OF
MY ETON POCKET MONEY FOR AS IT HAD EVER BEEN ABHORRENT TO MY NATURE TO
ASK PECUNIARY ASSISTANCE I HAD EARLY ACQUIRED HABITS OF SELF DENYING
ECONOMY HUSBANDING MY MONTHLY ALLOWANCE WITH ANXIOUS CARE IN ORDER TO
OBVIATE THE DANGER OF BEING FORCED IN SOME MOMENT OF FUTURE EXIGENCY
TO BEG ADDITIONAL AID
I REMEMBER MANY CALLED ME MISER AT THE TIME
AND I USED TO COUPLE THE REPROACH WITH THIS CONSOLATION BETTER TO BE
MISUNDERSTOOD NOW THAN REPULSED HEREAFTER
AT THIS DAY I HAD MY REWARD
I HAD HAD IT BEFORE WHEN ON PARTING WITH MY IRRITATED UNCLES ONE OF
THEM THREW DOWN ON THE TABLE BEFORE ME A 5L
NOTE WHICH I WAS ABLE TO
LEAVE THERE SAYING THAT MY TRAVELLING EXPENSES WERE ALREADY PROVIDED
FOR
MR
CRIMSWORTH EMPLOYED TIM TO FIND OUT WHETHER MY LANDLADY HAD
ANY COMPLAINT TO MAKE ON THE SCORE OF MY MORALS SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE
BELIEVED I WAS A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN AND ASKED TIM IN HER TURN IF HE
THOUGHT I HAD ANY INTENTION OF GOING INTO THE CHURCH SOME DAY FOR SHE
SAID SHE HAD HAD YOUNG CURATES TO LODGE IN HER HOUSE WHO WERE NOTHING
EQUAL TO ME FOR STEADINESS AND QUIETNESS
TIM WAS A RELIGIOUS MAN
HIMSELF INDEED HE WAS A JOINED METHODIST WHICH DID NOT BE IT
UNDERSTOOD PREVENT HIM FROM BEING AT THE SAME TIME AN ENGRAINED RASCAL
AND HE CAME AWAY MUCH POSED AT HEARING THIS ACCOUNT OF MY PIETY
HAVING
IMPARTED IT TO MR
CRIMSWORTH THAT GENTLEMAN WHO HIMSELF FREQUENTED
NO PLACE OF WORSHIP AND OWNED NO GOD BUT MAMMON TURNED THE INFORMATION
INTO A WEAPON OF ATTACK AGAINST THE EQUABILITY OF MY TEMPER
HE
COMMENCED A SERIES OF COVERT SNEERS OF WHICH I DID NOT AT FIRST
PERCEIVE THE DRIFT TILL MY LANDLADY HAPPENED TO RELATE THE CONVERSATION
SHE HAD HAD WITH MR
STEIGHTON THIS ENLIGHTENED ME AFTERWARDS I CAME
TO THE COUNTING HOUSE PREPARED AND MANAGED TO RECEIVE THE MILLOWNER'S
BLASPHEMOUS SARCASMS WHEN NEXT LEVELLED AT ME ON A BUCKLER OF
IMPENETRABLE INDIFFERENCE
ERE LONG HE TIRED OF WASTING HIS AMMUNITION
ON A STATUE BUT HE DID NOT THROW AWAY THE SHAFTS HE ONLY KEPT THEM
QUIET IN HIS QUIVER
ONCE DURING MY CLERKSHIP I HAD AN INVITATION TO CRIMSWORTH HALL IT
WAS ON THE OCCASION OF A LARGE PARTY GIVEN IN HONOUR OF THE MASTER'S
BIRTHDAY HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO INVITE HIS CLERKS ON SIMILAR
ANNIVERSARIES AND COULD NOT WELL PASS ME OVER I WAS HOWEVER KEPT
STRICTLY IN THE BACKGROUND
MRS
CRIMSWORTH ELEGANTLY DRESSED IN SATIN
AND LACE BLOOMING IN YOUTH AND HEALTH VOUCHSAFED ME NO MORE NOTICE
THAN WAS EXPRESSED BY A DISTANT MOVE CRIMSWORTH OF COURSE NEVER
SPOKE TO ME I WAS INTRODUCED TO NONE OF THE BAND OF YOUNG LADIES WHO
ENVELOPED IN SILVERY CLOUDS OF WHITE GAUZE AND MUSLIN SAT IN ARRAY
AGAINST ME ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF A LONG AND LARGE ROOM IN FACT I WAS
FAIRLY ISOLATED AND COULD BUT CONTEMPLATE THE SHINING ONES FROM AFAR
AND WHEN WEARY OF SUCH A DAZZLING SCENE TURN FOR A CHANGE TO THE
CONSIDERATION OF THE CARPET PATTERN
MR
CRIMSWORTH STANDING ON THE
RUG HIS ELBOW SUPPORTED BY THE MARBLE MANTELPIECE AND ABOUT HIM
A GROUP OF VERY PRETTY GIRLS WITH WHOM HE CONVERSED GAILY MR
CRIMSWORTH THUS PLACED GLANCED AT ME I LOOKED WEARY SOLITARY KEPT
DOWN LIKE SOME DESOLATE TUTOR OR GOVERNESS HE WAS SATISFIED
DANCING BEGAN I SHOULD HAVE LIKED WELL ENOUGH TO BE INTRODUCED TO SOME
PLEASING AND INTELLIGENT GIRL AND TO HAVE FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY
TO SHOW THAT I COULD BOTH FEEL AND COMMUNICATE THE PLEASURE OF SOCIAL
INTERCOURSE THAT I WAS NOT IN SHORT A BLOCK OR A PIECE OF FURNITURE
BUT AN ACTING THINKING SENTIENT MAN
MANY SMILING FACES AND GRACEFUL
FIGURES GLIDED PAST ME BUT THE SMILES WERE LAVISHED ON OTHER EYES THE
FIGURES SUSTAINED BY OTHER HANDS THAN MINE
I TURNED AWAY TANTALIZED
LEFT THE DANCERS AND WANDERED INTO THE OAK PANELLED DINING ROOM
NO
FIBRE OF SYMPATHY UNITED ME TO ANY LIVING THING IN THIS HOUSE I LOOKED
FOR AND FOUND MY MOTHER'S PICTURE
I TOOK A WAX TAPER FROM A STAND
AND HELD IT UP
I GAZED LONG EARNESTLY MY HEART GREW TO THE IMAGE
MY MOTHER I PERCEIVED HAD BEQUEATHED TO ME MUCH OF HER FEATURES AND
COUNTENANCE HER FOREHEAD HER EYES HER COMPLEXION
NO REGULAR BEAUTY
PLEASES EGOTISTICAL HUMAN BEINGS SO MUCH AS A SOFTENED AND REFINED
LIKENESS OF THEMSELVES FOR THIS REASON FATHERS REGARD WITH COMPLACENCY
THE LINEAMENTS OF THEIR DAUGHTERS' FACES WHERE FREQUENTLY THEIR OWN
SIMILITUDE IS FOUND FLATTERINGLY ASSOCIATED WITH SOFTNESS OF HUE AND
DELICACY OF OUTLINE
I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW THAT PICTURE TO ME SO
INTERESTING WOULD STRIKE AN IMPARTIAL SPECTATOR WHEN A VOICE CLOSE
BEHIND ME PRONOUNCED THE WORDS
HUMPH THERE'S SOME SENSE IN THAT FACE
I TURNED AT MY ELBOW STOOD A TALL MAN YOUNG THOUGH PROBABLY FIVE OR
SIX YEARS OLDER THAN I IN OTHER RESPECTS OF AN APPEARANCE THE OPPOSITE
TO COMMON PLACE THOUGH JUST NOW AS I AM NOT DISPOSED TO PAINT HIS
PORTRAIT IN DETAIL THE READER MUST BE CONTENT WITH THE SILHOUETTE I
HAVE JUST THROWN OFF IT WAS ALL I MYSELF SAW OF HIM FOR THE MOMENT I
DID NOT INVESTIGATE THE COLOUR OF HIS EYEBROWS NOR OF HIS EYES EITHER
I SAW HIS STATURE AND THE OUTLINE OF HIS SHAPE I SAW TOO HIS
FASTIDIOUS LOOKING RETROUSSE NOSE THESE OBSERVATIONS FEW IN NUMBER
AND GENERAL IN CHARACTER THE LAST EXCEPTED SUFFICED FOR THEY ENABLED
ME TO RECOGNIZE HIM
GOOD EVENING MR
HUNSDEN MUTTERED I WITH A BOW AND THEN LIKE A
SHY NOODLE AS I WAS I BEGAN MOVING AWAY AND WHY SIMPLY BECAUSE MR
HUNSDEN WAS A MANUFACTURER AND A MILLOWNER AND I WAS ONLY A CLERK AND
MY INSTINCT PROPELLED ME FROM MY SUPERIOR
I HAD FREQUENTLY SEEN HUNSDEN
IN BIGBEN CLOSE WHERE HE CAME ALMOST WEEKLY TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH
MR
CRIMSWORTH BUT I HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM NOR HE TO ME AND I OWED
HIM A SORT OF INVOLUNTARY GRUDGE BECAUSE HE HAD MORE THAN ONCE BEEN THE
TACIT WITNESS OF INSULTS OFFERED BY EDWARD TO ME
I HAD THE CONVICTION
THAT HE COULD ONLY REGARD ME AS A POOR SPIRITED SLAVE WHEREFORE I NOW
WENT ABOUT TO SHUN HIS PRESENCE AND ESCHEW HIS CONVERSATION
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ASKED HE AS I EDGED OFF SIDEWAYS
I HAD ALREADY
NOTICED THAT MR
HUNSDEN INDULGED IN ABRUPT FORMS OF SPEECH AND I
PERVERSELY SAID TO MYSELF
HE THINKS HE MAY SPEAK AS HE LIKES TO A POOR CLERK BUT MY MOOD IS NOT
PERHAPS SO SUPPLE AS HE DEEMS IT AND HIS ROUGH FREEDOM PLEASES ME NOT
AT ALL
I MADE SOME SLIGHT REPLY RATHER INDIFFERENT THAN COURTEOUS AND
CONTINUED TO MOVE AWAY
HE COOLLY PLANTED HIMSELF IN MY PATH
STAY HERE AWHILE SAID HE IT IS SO HOT IN THE DANCING ROOM BESIDES
YOU DON'T DANCE YOU HAVE NOT HAD A PARTNER TO NIGHT
HE WAS RIGHT AND AS HE SPOKE NEITHER HIS LOOK TONE NOR MANNER
DISPLEASED ME MY AMOUR PROPRE WAS PROPITIATED HE HAD NOT ADDRESSED
ME OUT OF CONDESCENSION BUT BECAUSE HAVING REPAIRED TO THE COOL
DINING ROOM FOR REFRESHMENT HE NOW WANTED SOME ONE TO TALK TO BY WAY
OF TEMPORARY AMUSEMENT
I HATE TO BE CONDESCENDED TO BUT I LIKE WELL
ENOUGH TO OBLIGE I STAYED
THAT IS A GOOD PICTURE HE CONTINUED RECURRING TO THE PORTRAIT
DO YOU CONSIDER THE FACE PRETTY I ASKED
PRETTY NO HOW CAN IT BE PRETTY WITH SUNK EYES AND HOLLOW CHEEKS
BUT IT IS PECULIAR IT SEEMS TO THINK
YOU COULD HAVE A TALK WITH THAT
WOMAN IF SHE WERE ALIVE ON OTHER SUBJECTS THAN DRESS VISITING AND
COMPLIMENTS
I AGREED WITH HIM BUT DID NOT SAY SO
HE WENT ON
NOT THAT I ADMIRE A HEAD OF THAT SORT IT WANTS CHARACTER AND FORCE
THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SEN SI TIVE SO HE ARTICULATED IT CURLING
HIS LIP AT THE SAME TIME IN THAT MOUTH BESIDES THERE IS ARISTOCRAT
WRITTEN ON THE BROW AND DEFINED IN THE FIGURE I HATE YOUR ARISTOCRATS
YOU THINK THEN MR
HUNSDEN THAT PATRICIAN DESCENT MAY BE READ IN A
DISTINCTIVE CAST OF FORM AND FEATURES
PATRICIAN DESCENT BE HANGED WHO DOUBTS THAT YOUR LORDLINGS MAY HAVE
THEIR 'DISTINCTIVE CAST OF FORM AND FEATURES' AS MUCH AS WE SHIRE
TRADESMEN HAVE OURS BUT WHICH IS THE BEST NOT THEIRS ASSUREDLY
AS
TO THEIR WOMEN IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THEY CULTIVATE BEAUTY FROM
CHILDHOOD UPWARDS AND MAY BY CARE AND TRAINING ATTAIN TO A CERTAIN
DEGREE OF EXCELLENCE IN THAT POINT JUST LIKE THE ORIENTAL ODALISQUES
YET EVEN THIS SUPERIORITY IS DOUBTFUL
COMPARE THE FIGURE IN THAT FRAME
WITH MRS
EDWARD CRIMSWORTH WHICH IS THE FINER ANIMAL
I REPLIED QUIETLY COMPARE YOURSELF AND MR
EDWARD CRIMSWORTH MR
HUNSDEN
OH CRIMSWORTH IS BETTER FILLED UP THAN I AM I KNOW BESIDES HE HAS A
STRAIGHT NOSE ARCHED EYEBROWS AND ALL THAT BUT THESE ADVANTAGES IF
THEY ARE ADVANTAGES HE DID NOT INHERIT FROM HIS MOTHER THE PATRICIAN
BUT FROM HIS FATHER OLD CRIMSWORTH WHO MY FATHER SAYS WAS AS
VERITABLE A SHIRE BLUE DYER AS EVER PUT INDIGO IN A VAT YET WITHAL
THE HANDSOMEST MAN IN THE THREE RIDINGS
IT IS YOU WILLIAM WHO ARE
THE ARISTOCRAT OF YOUR FAMILY AND YOU ARE NOT AS FINE A FELLOW AS YOUR
PLEBEIAN BROTHER BY LONG CHALK
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MR
HUNSDEN'S POINT BLANK MODE OF SPEECH WHICH
RATHER PLEASED ME THAN OTHERWISE BECAUSE IT SET ME AT MY EASE
I
CONTINUED THE CONVERSATION WITH A DEGREE OF INTEREST
HOW DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT I AM MR
CRIMSWORTH'S BROTHER I THOUGHT
YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE LOOKED UPON ME ONLY IN THE LIGHT OF A POOR
CLERK
WELL AND SO WE DO AND WHAT ARE YOU BUT A POOR CLERK YOU DO
CRIMSWORTH'S WORK AND HE GIVES YOU WAGES SHABBY WAGES THEY ARE TOO
I WAS SILENT
HUNSDEN'S LANGUAGE NOW BORDERED ON THE IMPERTINENT STILL
HIS MANNER DID NOT OFFEND ME IN THE LEAST IT ONLY PIQUED MY CURIOSITY
I WANTED HIM TO GO ON WHICH HE DID IN A LITTLE WHILE
THIS WORLD IS AN ABSURD ONE SAID HE
WHY SO MR
HUNSDEN
I WONDER YOU SHOULD ASK YOU ARE YOURSELF A STRONG PROOF OF THE
ABSURDITY I ALLUDE TO
I WAS DETERMINED HE SHOULD EXPLAIN HIMSELF OF HIS OWN ACCORD WITHOUT MY
PRESSING HIM SO TO DO SO I RESUMED MY SILENCE
IS IT YOUR INTENTION TO BECOME A TRADESMAN HE INQUIRED PRESENTLY
IT WAS MY SERIOUS INTENTION THREE MONTHS AGO
HUMPH THE MORE FOOL YOU YOU LOOK LIKE A TRADESMAN WHAT A PRACTICAL
BUSINESS LIKE FACE YOU HAVE
MY FACE IS AS THE LORD MADE IT MR
HUNSDEN
THE LORD NEVER MADE EITHER YOUR FACE OR HEAD FOR X WHAT GOOD CAN
YOUR BUMPS OF IDEALITY COMPARISON SELF ESTEEM CONSCIENTIOUSNESS
DO YOU HERE BUT IF YOU LIKE BIGBEN CLOSE STAY THERE IT'S YOUR OWN
AFFAIR NOT MINE
PERHAPS I HAVE NO CHOICE
WELL I CARE NOUGHT ABOUT IT IT WILL MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO ME WHAT
YOU DO OR WHERE YOU GO BUT I'M COOL NOW I WANT TO DANCE AGAIN AND
I SEE SUCH A FINE GIRL SITTING IN THE CORNER OF THE SOFA THERE BY
HER MAMMA SEE IF I DON'T GET HER FOR A PARTNER IN A JIFFY THERE'S
WADDY SAM WADDY MAKING UP TO HER WON'T I CUT HIM OUT
AND MR
HUNSDEN STRODE AWAY
I WATCHED HIM THROUGH THE OPEN
FOLDING DOORS HE OUTSTRIPPED WADDY APPLIED FOR THE HAND OF THE
FINE GIRL AND LED HER OFF TRIUMPHANT
SHE WAS A TALL WELL MADE
FULL FORMED DASHINGLY DRESSED YOUNG WOMAN MUCH IN THE STYLE OF MRS
E
CRIMSWORTH HUNSDEN WHIRLED HER THROUGH THE WALTZ WITH SPIRIT HE KEPT
AT HER SIDE DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING AND I READ IN HER
ANIMATED AND GRATIFIED COUNTENANCE THAT HE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING HIMSELF
PERFECTLY AGREEABLE
THE MAMMA TOO A STOUT PERSON IN A TURBAN MRS
LUPTON BY NAME LOOKED WELL PLEASED PROPHETIC VISIONS PROBABLY
FLATTERED HER INWARD EYE
THE HUNSDENS WERE OF AN OLD STEM AND SCORNFUL
AS YORKE SUCH WAS MY LATE INTERLOCUTOR'S NAME PROFESSED TO BE OF
THE ADVANTAGES OF BIRTH IN HIS SECRET HEART HE WELL KNEW AND FULLY
APPRECIATED THE DISTINCTION HIS ANCIENT IF NOT HIGH LINEAGE CONFERRED
ON HIM IN A MUSHROOM PLACE LIKE X CONCERNING WHOSE INHABITANTS
IT WAS PROVERBIALLY SAID THAT NOT ONE IN A THOUSAND KNEW HIS OWN
GRANDFATHER
MOREOVER THE HUNSDENS ONCE RICH WERE STILL INDEPENDENT
AND REPORT AFFIRMED THAT YORKE BADE FAIR BY HIS SUCCESS IN BUSINESS
TO RESTORE TO PRISTINE PROSPERITY THE PARTIALLY DECAYED FORTUNES OF HIS
HOUSE
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CONSIDERED MRS
LUPTON'S BROAD FACE MIGHT
WELL WEAR A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AS SHE CONTEMPLATED THE HEIR OF HUNSDEN
WOOD OCCUPIED IN PAYING ASSIDUOUS COURT TO HER DARLING SARAH MARTHA
I
HOWEVER WHOSE OBSERVATIONS BEING LESS ANXIOUS WERE LIKELY TO BE MORE
ACCURATE SOON SAW THAT THE GROUNDS FOR MATERNAL SELF CONGRATULATION
WERE SLIGHT INDEED THE GENTLEMAN APPEARED TO ME MUCH MORE DESIROUS OF
MAKING THAN SUSCEPTIBLE OF RECEIVING AN IMPRESSION
I KNOW NOT WHAT IT
WAS IN MR
HUNSDEN THAT AS I WATCHED HIM I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO
SUGGESTED TO ME EVERY NOW AND THEN THE IDEA OF A FOREIGNER
IN FORM
AND FEATURES HE MIGHT BE PRONOUNCED ENGLISH THOUGH EVEN THERE ONE
CAUGHT A DASH OF SOMETHING GALLIC BUT HE HAD NO ENGLISH SHYNESS HE HAD
LEARNT SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW THE ART OF SETTING HIMSELF QUITE AT HIS EASE
AND OF ALLOWING NO INSULAR TIMIDITY TO INTERVENE AS A BARRIER BETWEEN
HIM AND HIS CONVENIENCE OR PLEASURE
REFINEMENT HE DID NOT AFFECT YET
VULGAR HE COULD NOT BE CALLED HE WAS NOT ODD NO QUIZ YET HE RESEMBLED
NO ONE ELSE I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE HIS GENERAL BEARING INTIMATED
COMPLETE SOVEREIGN SATISFACTION WITH HIMSELF YET AT TIMES AN
INDESCRIBABLE SHADE PASSED LIKE AN ECLIPSE OVER HIS COUNTENANCE AND
SEEMED TO ME LIKE THE SIGN OF A SUDDEN AND STRONG INWARD DOUBT OF
HIMSELF HIS WORDS AND ACTIONS AN ENERGETIC DISCONTENT AT HIS LIFE OR
HIS SOCIAL POSITION HIS FUTURE PROSPECTS OR HIS MENTAL ATTAINMENTS I
KNOW NOT WHICH PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT MIGHT ONLY BE A BILIOUS CAPRICE
CHAPTER IV
NO MAN LIKES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE HAS MADE A MISTAKE IN THE CHOICE OF
HIS PROFESSION AND EVERY MAN WORTHY OF THE NAME WILL ROW LONG AGAINST
WIND AND TIDE BEFORE HE ALLOWS HIMSELF TO CRY OUT I AM BAFFLED AND
SUBMITS TO BE FLOATED PASSIVELY BACK TO LAND
FROM THE FIRST WEEK OF MY
RESIDENCE IN X I FELT MY OCCUPATION IRKSOME
THE THING ITSELF THE
WORK OF COPYING AND TRANSLATING BUSINESS LETTERS WAS A DRY AND TEDIOUS
TASK ENOUGH BUT HAD THAT BEEN ALL I SHOULD LONG HAVE BORNE WITH THE
NUISANCE I AM NOT OF AN IMPATIENT NATURE AND INFLUENCED BY THE DOUBLE
DESIRE OF GETTING MY LIVING AND JUSTIFYING TO MYSELF AND OTHERS THE
RESOLUTION I HAD TAKEN TO BECOME A TRADESMAN I SHOULD HAVE ENDURED
IN SILENCE THE RUST AND CRAMP OF MY BEST FACULTIES I SHOULD NOT HAVE
WHISPERED EVEN INWARDLY THAT I LONGED FOR LIBERTY I SHOULD HAVE PENT
IN EVERY SIGH BY WHICH MY HEART MIGHT HAVE VENTURED TO INTIMATE ITS
DISTRESS UNDER THE CLOSENESS SMOKE MONOTONY AND JOYLESS TUMULT OF
BIGBEN CLOSE AND ITS PANTING DESIRE FOR FREER AND FRESHER SCENES I
SHOULD HAVE SET UP THE IMAGE OF DUTY THE FETISH OF PERSEVERANCE IN MY
SMALL BEDROOM AT MRS
KING'S LODGINGS AND THEY TWO SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MY HOUSEHOLD GODS FROM WHICH MY DARLING MY CHERISHED IN SECRET
IMAGINATION THE TENDER AND THE MIGHTY SHOULD NEVER EITHER BY SOFTNESS
OR STRENGTH HAVE SEVERED ME
BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE ANTIPATHY WHICH
HAD SPRUNG UP BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY EMPLOYER STRIKING DEEPER ROOT AND
SPREADING DENSER SHADE DAILY EXCLUDED ME FROM EVERY GLIMPSE OF THE
SUNSHINE OF LIFE AND I BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE A PLANT GROWING IN HUMID
DARKNESS OUT OF THE SLIMY WALLS OF A WELL
ANTIPATHY IS THE ONLY WORD WHICH CAN EXPRESS THE FEELING EDWARD
CRIMSWORTH HAD FOR ME A FEELING IN A GREAT MEASURE INVOLUNTARY AND
WHICH WAS LIABLE TO BE EXCITED BY EVERY THE MOST TRIFLING MOVEMENT
LOOK OR WORD OF MINE
MY SOUTHERN ACCENT ANNOYED HIM THE DEGREE
OF EDUCATION EVINCED IN MY LANGUAGE IRRITATED HIM MY PUNCTUALITY
INDUSTRY AND ACCURACY FIXED HIS DISLIKE AND GAVE IT THE HIGH FLAVOUR
AND POIGNANT RELISH OF ENVY HE FEARED THAT I TOO SHOULD ONE DAY MAKE A
SUCCESSFUL TRADESMAN
HAD I BEEN IN ANYTHING INFERIOR TO HIM HE WOULD
NOT HAVE HATED ME SO THOROUGHLY BUT I KNEW ALL THAT HE KNEW AND WHAT
WAS WORSE HE SUSPECTED THAT I KEPT THE PADLOCK OF SILENCE ON MENTAL
WEALTH IN WHICH HE WAS NO SHARER
IF HE COULD HAVE ONCE PLACED ME IN A
RIDICULOUS OR MORTIFYING POSITION HE WOULD HAVE FORGIVEN ME MUCH BUT I
WAS GUARDED BY THREE FACULTIES CAUTION TACT OBSERVATION AND
PROWLING AND PRYING AS WAS EDWARD'S MALIGNITY IT COULD NEVER BAFFLE
THE LYNX EYES OF THESE MY NATURAL SENTINELS
DAY BY DAY DID HIS MALICE
WATCH MY TACT HOPING IT WOULD SLEEP AND PREPARED TO STEAL SNAKE LIKE
ON ITS SLUMBER BUT TACT IF IT BE GENUINE NEVER SLEEPS
I HAD RECEIVED MY FIRST QUARTER'S WAGES AND WAS RETURNING TO MY
LODGINGS POSSESSED HEART AND SOUL WITH THE PLEASANT FEELING THAT
THE MASTER WHO HAD PAID ME GRUDGED EVERY PENNY OF THAT HARD EARNED
PITTANCE I HAD LONG CEASED TO REGARD MR
CRIMSWORTH AS MY BROTHER HE
WAS A HARD GRINDING MASTER HE WISHED TO BE AN INEXORABLE TYRANT THAT
WAS ALL
THOUGHTS NOT VARIED BUT STRONG OCCUPIED MY MIND TWO VOICES
SPOKE WITHIN ME AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY UTTERED THE SAME MONOTONOUS
PHRASES
ONE SAID WILLIAM YOUR LIFE IS INTOLERABLE THE OTHER WHAT
CAN YOU DO TO ALTER IT I WALKED FAST FOR IT WAS A COLD FROSTY NIGHT
IN JANUARY AS I APPROACHED MY LODGINGS I TURNED FROM A GENERAL VIEW OF
MY AFFAIRS TO THE PARTICULAR SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER MY FIRE WOULD BE
OUT LOOKING TOWARDS THE WINDOW OF MY SITTING ROOM I SAW NO CHEERING
RED GLEAM
THAT SLUT OF A SERVANT HAS NEGLECTED IT AS USUAL SAID I AND I SHALL
SEE NOTHING BUT PALE ASHES IF I GO IN IT IS A FINE STARLIGHT NIGHT I
WILL WALK A LITTLE FARTHER
IT WAS A FINE NIGHT AND THE STREETS WERE DRY AND EVEN CLEAN FOR X
THERE WAS A CRESCENT CURVE OF MOONLIGHT TO BE SEEN BY THE PARISH CHURCH
TOWER AND HUNDREDS OF STARS SHONE KEENLY BRIGHT IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE
SKY
UNCONSCIOUSLY I STEERED MY COURSE TOWARDS THE COUNTRY I HAD GOT INTO
GROVE STREET AND BEGAN TO FEEL THE PLEASURE OF SEEING DIM TREES AT THE
EXTREMITY ROUND A SUBURBAN HOUSE WHEN A PERSON LEANING OVER THE IRON
GATE OF ONE OF THE SMALL GARDENS WHICH FRONT THE NEAT DWELLING HOUSES IN
THIS STREET ADDRESSED ME AS I WAS HURRYING WITH QUICK STRIDE PAST
WHAT THE DEUCE IS THE HURRY JUST SO MUST LOT HAVE LEFT SODOM WHEN HE
EXPECTED FIRE TO POUR DOWN UPON IT OUT OF BURNING BRASS CLOUDS
I STOPPED SHORT AND LOOKED TOWARDS THE SPEAKER
I SMELT THE FRAGRANCE
AND SAW THE RED SPARK OF A CIGAR THE DUSK OUTLINE OF A MAN TOO BENT
TOWARDS ME OVER THE WICKET
YOU SEE I AM MEDITATING IN THE FIELD AT EVENTIDE CONTINUED THIS
SHADE
GOD KNOWS IT'S COOL WORK ESPECIALLY AS INSTEAD OF REBECCA ON
A CAMEL'S HUMP WITH BRACELETS ON HER ARMS AND A RING IN HER NOSE FATE
SENDS ME ONLY A COUNTING HOUSE CLERK IN A GREY TWEED WRAPPER THE
VOICE WAS FAMILIAR TO ME ITS SECOND UTTERANCE ENABLED ME TO SEIZE THE
SPEAKER'S IDENTITY
MR
HUNSDEN GOOD EVENING
GOOD EVENING INDEED YES BUT YOU WOULD HAVE PASSED ME WITHOUT
RECOGNITION IF I HAD NOT BEEN SO CIVIL AS TO SPEAK FIRST
I DID NOT KNOW YOU
A FAMOUS EXCUSE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN ME I KNEW YOU THOUGH YOU
WERE GOING AHEAD LIKE A STEAM ENGINE
ARE THE POLICE AFTER YOU
IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR WHILE I'M NOT OF CONSEQUENCE ENOUGH TO
ATTRACT THEM
ALAS POOR SHEPHERD ALACK AND WELL A DAY WHAT A THEME FOR REGRET AND
HOW DOWN IN THE MOUTH YOU MUST BE JUDGING FROM THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE
BUT SINCE YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FROM THE POLICE FROM WHOM ARE YOU RUNNING
THE DEVIL
ON THE CONTRARY I AM GOING POST TO HIM
THAT IS WELL YOU'RE JUST IN LUCK THIS IS TUESDAY EVENING THERE ARE
SCORES OF MARKET GIGS AND CARTS RETURNING TO DINNEFORD TO NIGHT AND HE
OR SOME OF HIS HAVE A SEAT IN ALL REGULARLY SO IF YOU'LL STEP IN
AND SIT HALF AN HOUR IN MY BACHELOR'S PARLOUR YOU MAY CATCH HIM AS HE
PASSES WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE
I THINK THOUGH YOU'D BETTER LET HIM ALONE
TO NIGHT HE'LL HAVE SO MANY CUSTOMERS TO SERVE TUESDAY IS HIS BUSY DAY
IN X AND DINNEFORD COME IN AT ALL EVENTS
HE SWUNG THE WICKET OPEN AS HE SPOKE
DO YOU REALLY WISH ME TO GO IN I ASKED
AS YOU PLEASE I'M ALONE YOUR COMPANY FOR AN HOUR OR TWO WOULD BE
AGREEABLE TO ME BUT IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO FAVOUR ME SO FAR I'LL NOT
PRESS THE POINT
I HATE TO BORE ANY ONE
IT SUITED ME TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION AS IT SUITED HUNSDEN TO GIVE IT
I PASSED THROUGH THE GATE AND FOLLOWED HIM TO THE FRONT DOOR WHICH HE
OPENED THENCE WE TRAVERSED A PASSAGE AND ENTERED HIS PARLOUR THE DOOR
BEING SHUT HE POINTED ME TO AN ARM CHAIR BY THE HEARTH I SAT DOWN AND
GLANCED ROUND ME
IT WAS A COMFORTABLE ROOM AT ONCE SNUG AND HANDSOME THE BRIGHT GRATE
WAS FILLED WITH A GENUINE SHIRE FIRE RED CLEAR AND GENEROUS NO
PENURIOUS SOUTH OF ENGLAND EMBERS HEAPED IN THE CORNER OF A GRATE
ON
THE TABLE A SHADED LAMP DIFFUSED AROUND A SOFT PLEASANT AND EQUAL
LIGHT THE FURNITURE WAS ALMOST LUXURIOUS FOR A YOUNG BACHELOR
COMPRISING A COUCH AND TWO VERY EASY CHAIRS BOOKSHELVES FILLED THE
RECESSES ON EACH SIDE OF THE MANTELPIECE THEY WERE WELL FURNISHED AND
ARRANGED WITH PERFECT ORDER
THE NEATNESS OF THE ROOM SUITED MY TASTE
I HATE IRREGULAR AND SLOVENLY HABITS
FROM WHAT I SAW I CONCLUDED THAT
HUNSDEN'S IDEAS ON THAT POINT CORRESPONDED WITH MY OWN
WHILE HE REMOVED
FROM THE CENTRE TABLE TO THE SIDE BOARD A FEW PAMPHLETS AND PERIODICALS
I RAN MY EYE ALONG THE SHELVES OF THE BOOK CASE NEAREST ME
FRENCH AND
GERMAN WORKS PREDOMINATED THE OLD FRENCH DRAMATISTS SUNDRY MODERN
AUTHORS THIERS VILLEMAIN PAUL DE KOCK GEORGE SAND EUGENE SUE IN
GERMAN GOETHE SCHILLER ZSCHOKKE JEAN PAUL RICHTER IN ENGLISH THERE
WERE WORKS ON POLITICAL ECONOMY
I EXAMINED NO FURTHER FOR MR
HUNSDEN
HIMSELF RECALLED MY ATTENTION
YOU SHALL HAVE SOMETHING SAID HE FOR YOU OUGHT TO FEEL DISPOSED FOR
REFRESHMENT AFTER WALKING NOBODY KNOWS HOW FAR ON SUCH A CANADIAN NIGHT
AS THIS BUT IT SHALL NOT BE BRANDY AND WATER AND IT SHALL NOT BE
A BOTTLE OF PORT NOR DITTO OF SHERRY
I KEEP NO SUCH POISON
I HAVE
RHEIN WEIN FOR MY OWN DRINKING AND YOU MAY CHOOSE BETWEEN THAT AND
COFFEE
HERE AGAIN HUNSDEN SUITED ME IF THERE WAS ONE GENERALLY RECEIVED
PRACTICE I ABHORRED MORE THAN ANOTHER IT WAS THE HABITUAL IMBIBING OF
SPIRITS AND STRONG WINES
I HAD HOWEVER NO FANCY FOR HIS ACID GERMAN
NECTAR BUT I LIKED COFFEE SO I RESPONDED
GIVE ME SOME COFFEE MR
HUNSDEN
I PERCEIVED MY ANSWER PLEASED HIM HE HAD DOUBTLESS EXPECTED TO SEE A
CHILLING EFFECT PRODUCED BY HIS STEADY ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE WOULD GIVE
ME NEITHER WINE NOR SPIRITS HE JUST SHOT ONE SEARCHING GLANCE AT MY
FACE TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER MY CORDIALITY WAS GENUINE OR A MERE FEINT
OF POLITENESS
I SMILED BECAUSE I QUITE UNDERSTOOD HIM AND WHILE I
HONOURED HIS CONSCIENTIOUS FIRMNESS I WAS AMUSED AT HIS MISTRUST HE
SEEMED SATISFIED RANG THE BELL AND ORDERED COFFEE WHICH WAS PRESENTLY
BROUGHT FOR HIMSELF A BUNCH OF GRAPES AND HALF A PINT OF SOMETHING
SOUR SUFFICED
MY COFFEE WAS EXCELLENT I TOLD HIM SO AND EXPRESSED THE
SHUDDERING PITY WITH WHICH HIS ANCHORITE FARE INSPIRED ME
HE DID NOT
ANSWER AND I SCARCELY THINK HEARD MY REMARK
AT THAT MOMENT ONE OF
THOSE MOMENTARY ECLIPSES I BEFORE ALLUDED TO HAD COME OVER HIS FACE
EXTINGUISHING HIS SMILE AND REPLACING BY AN ABSTRACTED AND ALIENATED
LOOK THE CUSTOMARILY SHREWD BANTERING GLANCE OF HIS EYE
I EMPLOYED
THE INTERVAL OF SILENCE IN A RAPID SCRUTINY OF HIS PHYSIOGNOMY
I HAD
NEVER OBSERVED HIM CLOSELY BEFORE AND AS MY SIGHT IS VERY SHORT I HAD
GATHERED ONLY A VAGUE GENERAL IDEA OF HIS APPEARANCE I WAS SURPRISED
NOW ON EXAMINATION TO PERCEIVE HOW SMALL AND EVEN FEMININE WERE HIS
LINEAMENTS HIS TALL FIGURE LONG AND DARK LOCKS HIS VOICE AND GENERAL
BEARING HAD IMPRESSED ME WITH THE NOTION OF SOMETHING POWERFUL AND
MASSIVE NOT AT ALL MY OWN FEATURES WERE CAST IN A HARSHER AND SQUARER
MOULD THAN HIS
I DISCERNED THAT THERE WOULD BE CONTRASTS BETWEEN HIS
INWARD AND OUTWARD MAN CONTENTIONS TOO FOR I SUSPECTED HIS SOUL
HAD MORE OF WILL AND AMBITION THAN HIS BODY HAD OF FIBRE AND MUSCLE
PERHAPS IN THESE INCOMPATIBILITIES OF THE PHYSIQUE WITH THE MORALE
LAY THE SECRET OF THAT FITFUL GLOOM HE WOULD BUT COULD NOT AND THE
ATHLETIC MIND SCOWLED SCORN ON ITS MORE FRAGILE COMPANION
AS TO HIS
GOOD LOOKS I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE A WOMAN'S OPINION ON THAT
SUBJECT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HIS FACE MIGHT PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT
ON A LADY THAT A VERY PIQUANT AND INTERESTING THOUGH SCARCELY PRETTY
FEMALE FACE WOULD ON A MAN
I HAVE MENTIONED HIS DARK LOCKS THEY WERE
BRUSHED SIDEWAYS ABOVE A WHITE AND SUFFICIENTLY EXPANSIVE FOREHEAD HIS
CHEEK HAD A RATHER HECTIC FRESHNESS HIS FEATURES MIGHT HAVE DONE WELL
ON CANVAS BUT INDIFFERENTLY IN MARBLE THEY WERE PLASTIC CHARACTER
HAD SET A STAMP UPON EACH EXPRESSION RE CAST THEM AT HER PLEASURE AND
STRANGE METAMORPHOSES SHE WROUGHT GIVING HIM NOW THE MIEN OF A MOROSE
BULL AND ANON THAT OF AN ARCH AND MISCHIEVOUS GIRL MORE FREQUENTLY
THE TWO SEMBLANCES WERE BLENT AND A QUEER COMPOSITE COUNTENANCE THEY
MADE
STARTING FROM HIS SILENT FIT HE BEGAN
WILLIAM WHAT A FOOL YOU ARE TO LIVE IN THOSE DISMAL LODGINGS OF MRS
KING'S WHEN YOU MIGHT TAKE ROOMS HERE IN GROVE STREET AND HAVE A
GARDEN LIKE ME
I SHOULD BE TOO FAR FROM THE MILL
WHAT OF THAT IT WOULD DO YOU GOOD TO WALK THERE AND BACK TWO OR THREE
TIMES A DAY BESIDES ARE YOU SUCH A FOSSIL THAT YOU NEVER WISH TO SEE A
FLOWER OR A GREEN LEAF
I AM NO FOSSIL
WHAT ARE YOU THEN YOU SIT AT THAT DESK IN CRIMSWORTH'S COUNTING HOUSE
DAY BY DAY AND WEEK BY WEEK SCRAPING WITH A PEN ON PAPER JUST LIKE AN
AUTOMATON YOU NEVER GET UP YOU NEVER SAY YOU ARE TIRED YOU NEVER ASK
FOR A HOLIDAY YOU NEVER TAKE CHANGE OR RELAXATION YOU GIVE WAY TO
NO EXCESS OF AN EVENING YOU NEITHER KEEP WILD COMPANY NOR INDULGE IN
STRONG DRINK
DO YOU MR
HUNSDEN
DON'T THINK TO POSE ME WITH SHORT QUESTIONS YOUR CASE AND MINE
ARE DIAMETRICALLY DIFFERENT AND IT IS NONSENSE ATTEMPTING TO DRAW A
PARALLEL
I SAY THAT WHEN A MAN ENDURES PATIENTLY WHAT OUGHT TO BE
UNENDURABLE HE IS A FOSSIL
WHENCE DO YOU ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY PATIENCE
WHY MAN DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU ARE A MYSTERY THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SEEMED
SURPRISED AT MY KNOWING TO WHAT FAMILY YOU BELONGED NOW YOU FIND
SUBJECT FOR WONDERMENT IN MY CALLING YOU PATIENT
WHAT DO YOU THINK I DO
WITH MY EYES AND EARS I'VE BEEN IN YOUR COUNTING HOUSE MORE THAN ONCE
WHEN CRIMSWORTH HAS TREATED YOU LIKE A DOG CALLED FOR A BOOK FOR
INSTANCE AND WHEN YOU GAVE HIM THE WRONG ONE OR WHAT HE CHOSE TO
CONSIDER THE WRONG ONE FLUNG IT BACK ALMOST IN YOUR FACE DESIRED YOU
TO SHUT OR OPEN THE DOOR AS IF YOU HAD BEEN HIS FLUNKEY TO SAY NOTHING
OF YOUR POSITION AT THE PARTY ABOUT A MONTH AGO WHERE YOU HAD NEITHER
PLACE NOR PARTNER BUT HOVERED ABOUT LIKE A POOR SHABBY HANGER ON AND
HOW PATIENT YOU WERE UNDER EACH AND ALL OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
WELL MR
HUNSDEN WHAT THEN
I CAN HARDLY TELL YOU WHAT THEN THE CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN AS TO
YOUR CHARACTER DEPENDS UPON THE NATURE OF THE MOTIVES WHICH GUIDE
YOUR CONDUCT IF YOU ARE PATIENT BECAUSE YOU EXPECT TO MAKE SOMETHING
EVENTUALLY OUT OF CRIMSWORTH NOTWITHSTANDING HIS TYRANNY OR PERHAPS BY
MEANS OF IT YOU ARE WHAT THE WORLD CALLS AN INTERESTED AND MERCENARY
BUT MAY BE A VERY WISE FELLOW IF YOU ARE PATIENT BECAUSE YOU THINK IT A
DUTY TO MEET INSULT WITH SUBMISSION YOU ARE AN ESSENTIAL SAP AND IN
NO SHAPE THE MAN FOR MY MONEY IF YOU ARE PATIENT BECAUSE YOUR NATURE IS
PHLEGMATIC FLAT INEXCITABLE AND THAT YOU CANNOT GET UP TO THE PITCH
OF RESISTANCE WHY GOD MADE YOU TO BE CRUSHED AND LIE DOWN BY ALL
MEANS AND LIE FLAT AND LET JUGGERNAUT RIDE WELL OVER YOU
MR
HUNSDEN'S ELOQUENCE WAS NOT IT WILL BE PERCEIVED OF THE SMOOTH AND
OILY ORDER
AS HE SPOKE HE PLEASED ME ILL
I SEEM TO RECOGNIZE IN HIM
ONE OF THOSE CHARACTERS WHO SENSITIVE ENOUGH THEMSELVES ARE SELFISHLY
RELENTLESS TOWARDS THE SENSITIVENESS OF OTHERS
MOREOVER THOUGH HE
WAS NEITHER LIKE CRIMSWORTH NOR LORD TYNEDALE YET HE WAS ACRID AND I
SUSPECTED OVERBEARING IN HIS WAY THERE WAS A TONE OF DESPOTISM IN
THE URGENCY OF THE VERY REPROACHES BY WHICH HE AIMED AT GOADING THE
OPPRESSED INTO REBELLION AGAINST THE OPPRESSOR
LOOKING AT HIM STILL
MORE FIXEDLY THAN I HAD YET DONE I SAW WRITTEN IN HIS EYE AND MIEN A
RESOLUTION TO ARROGATE TO HIMSELF A FREEDOM SO UNLIMITED THAT IT MIGHT
OFTEN TRENCH ON THE JUST LIBERTY OF HIS NEIGHBOURS
I RAPIDLY RAN OVER
THESE THOUGHTS AND THEN I LAUGHED A LOW AND INVOLUNTARY LAUGH MOVED
THERETO BY A SLIGHT INWARD REVELATION OF THE INCONSISTENCY OF MAN
IT WAS AS I THOUGHT HUNSDEN HAD EXPECTED ME TO TAKE WITH CALM HIS
INCORRECT AND OFFENSIVE SURMISES HIS BITTER AND HAUGHTY TAUNTS AND
HIMSELF WAS CHAFED BY A LAUGH SCARCE LOUDER THAN A WHISPER
HIS BROW DARKENED HIS THIN NOSTRIL DILATED A LITTLE
YES HE BEGAN I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE AN ARISTOCRAT AND WHO BUT
AN ARISTOCRAT WOULD LAUGH SUCH A LAUGH AS THAT AND LOOK SUCH A LOOK
A LAUGH FRIGIDLY JEERING A LOOK LAZILY MUTINOUS GENTLEMANLIKE IRONY
PATRICIAN RESENTMENT
WHAT A NOBLEMAN YOU WOULD HAVE MADE WILLIAM
CRIMSWORTH YOU ARE CUT OUT FOR ONE PITY FORTUNE HAS BAULKED NATURE
LOOK AT THE FEATURES FIGURE EVEN TO THE HANDS DISTINCTION ALL
OVER UGLY DISTINCTION NOW IF YOU'D ONLY AN ESTATE AND A MANSION
AND A PARK AND A TITLE HOW YOU COULD PLAY THE EXCLUSIVE MAINTAIN THE
RIGHTS OF YOUR CLASS TRAIN YOUR TENANTRY IN HABITS OF RESPECT TO THE
PEERAGE OPPOSE AT EVERY STEP THE ADVANCING POWER OF THE PEOPLE SUPPORT
YOUR ROTTEN ORDER AND BE READY FOR ITS SAKE TO WADE KNEE DEEP IN
CHURLS' BLOOD AS IT IS YOU'VE NO POWER YOU CAN DO NOTHING YOU'RE
WRECKED AND STRANDED ON THE SHORES OF COMMERCE FORCED INTO COLLISION
WITH PRACTICAL MEN WITH WHOM YOU CANNOT COPE FOR YOU'LL NEVER BE A
TRADESMAN
THE FIRST PART OF HUNSDEN'S SPEECH MOVED ME NOT AT ALL OR IF IT DID
IT WAS ONLY TO WONDER AT THE PERVERSION INTO WHICH PREJUDICE HAD TWISTED
HIS JUDGMENT OF MY CHARACTER THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE HOWEVER NOT ONLY
MOVED BUT SHOOK ME THE BLOW IT GAVE WAS A SEVERE ONE BECAUSE TRUTH
WIELDED THE WEAPON
IF I SMILED NOW IT WAS ONLY IN DISDAIN OF MYSELF
HUNSDEN SAW HIS ADVANTAGE HE FOLLOWED IT UP
YOU'LL MAKE NOTHING BY TRADE CONTINUED HE NOTHING MORE THAN THE
CRUST OF DRY BREAD AND THE DRAUGHT OF FAIR WATER ON WHICH YOU NOW LIVE
YOUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A COMPETENCY LIES IN MARRYING A RICH WIDOW
OR RUNNING AWAY WITH AN HEIRESS
I LEAVE SUCH SHIFTS TO BE PUT IN PRACTICE BY THOSE WHO DEVISE THEM
SAID I RISING
AND EVEN THAT IS HOPELESS HE WENT ON COOLLY
WHAT WIDOW WOULD HAVE
YOU MUCH LESS WHAT HEIRESS YOU'RE NOT BOLD AND VENTURESOME ENOUGH FOR
THE ONE NOR HANDSOME AND FASCINATING ENOUGH FOR THE OTHER
YOU THINK
PERHAPS YOU LOOK INTELLIGENT AND POLISHED CARRY YOUR INTELLECT AND
REFINEMENT TO MARKET AND TELL ME IN A PRIVATE NOTE WHAT PRICE IS BID
FOR THEM
MR
HUNSDEN HAD TAKEN HIS TONE FOR THE NIGHT THE STRING HE STRUCK WAS
OUT OF TUNE HE WOULD FINGER NO OTHER
AVERSE TO DISCORD OF WHICH I HAD
ENOUGH EVERY DAY AND ALL DAY LONG I CONCLUDED AT LAST THAT SILENCE
AND SOLITUDE WERE PREFERABLE TO JARRING CONVERSE I BADE HIM GOOD NIGHT
WHAT ARE YOU GOING LAD WELL GOOD NIGHT YOU'LL FIND THE DOOR AND
HE SAT STILL IN FRONT OF THE FIRE WHILE I LEFT THE ROOM AND THE HOUSE
I HAD GOT A GOOD WAY ON MY RETURN TO MY LODGINGS BEFORE I FOUND OUT THAT
I WAS WALKING VERY FAST AND BREATHING VERY HARD AND THAT MY NAILS WERE
ALMOST STUCK INTO THE PALMS OF MY CLENCHED HANDS AND THAT MY TEETH WERE
SET FAST ON MAKING THIS DISCOVERY I RELAXED BOTH MY PACE FISTS AND
JAWS BUT I COULD NOT SO SOON CAUSE THE REGRETS RUSHING RAPIDLY THROUGH
MY MIND TO SLACKEN THEIR TIDE
WHY DID I MAKE MYSELF A TRADESMAN WHY
DID I ENTER HUNSDEN'S HOUSE THIS EVENING WHY AT DAWN TO MORROW MUST
I REPAIR TO CRIMSWORTH'S MILL ALL THAT NIGHT DID I ASK MYSELF THESE
QUESTIONS AND ALL THAT NIGHT FIERCELY DEMANDED OF MY SOUL AN ANSWER
I
GOT NO SLEEP MY HEAD BURNED MY FEET FROZE AT LAST THE FACTORY BELLS
RANG AND I SPRANG FROM MY BED WITH OTHER SLAVES
CHAPTER V
THERE IS A CLIMAX TO EVERYTHING TO EVERY STATE OF FEELING AS WELL AS TO
EVERY POSITION IN LIFE
I TURNED THIS TRUISM OVER IN MY MIND AS IN THE
FROSTY DAWN OF A JANUARY MORNING I HURRIED DOWN THE STEEP AND NOW
ICY STREET WHICH DESCENDED FROM MRS
KING'S TO THE CLOSE
THE FACTORY
WORKPEOPLE HAD PRECEDED ME BY NEARLY AN HOUR AND THE MILL WAS ALL
LIGHTED UP AND IN FULL OPERATION WHEN I REACHED IT
I REPAIRED TO MY
POST IN THE COUNTING HOUSE AS USUAL THE FIRE THERE BUT JUST LIT AS
YET ONLY SMOKED STEIGHTON HAD NOT YET ARRIVED
I SHUT THE DOOR AND SAT
DOWN AT THE DESK MY HANDS RECENTLY WASHED IN HALF FROZEN WATER WERE
STILL NUMB I COULD NOT WRITE TILL THEY HAD REGAINED VITALITY SO I
WENT ON THINKING AND STILL THE THEME OF MY THOUGHTS WAS THE CLIMAX
SELF DISSATISFACTION TROUBLED EXCEEDINGLY THE CURRENT OF MY MEDITATIONS
COME WILLIAM CRIMSWORTH SAID MY CONSCIENCE OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT
WITHIN OURSELVES TAKES OURSELVES TO TASK COME GET A CLEAR NOTION OF
WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE OR WHAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE
YOU TALK OF A CLIMAX
PRAY HAS YOUR ENDURANCE REACHED ITS CLIMAX IT IS NOT FOUR MONTHS OLD
WHAT A FINE RESOLUTE FELLOW YOU IMAGINED YOURSELF TO BE WHEN YOU TOLD
TYNEDALE YOU WOULD TREAD IN YOUR FATHER'S STEPS AND A PRETTY TREADING
YOU ARE LIKELY TO MAKE OF IT HOW WELL YOU LIKE X JUST AT THIS
MOMENT HOW REDOLENT OF PLEASANT ASSOCIATIONS ARE ITS STREETS ITS SHOPS
ITS WAREHOUSES ITS FACTORIES HOW THE PROSPECT OF THIS DAY CHEERS
YOU LETTER COPYING TILL NOON SOLITARY DINNER AT YOUR LODGINGS
LETTER COPYING TILL EVENING SOLITUDE FOR YOU NEITHER FIND PLEASURE
IN BROWN'S NOR SMITH'S NOR NICHOLL'S NOR ECCLE'S COMPANY AND AS
TO HUNSDEN YOU FANCIED THERE WAS PLEASURE TO BE DERIVED FROM HIS
SOCIETY HE HE HOW DID YOU LIKE THE TASTE YOU HAD OF HIM LAST NIGHT
WAS IT SWEET YET HE IS A TALENTED AN ORIGINAL MINDED MAN AND EVEN
HE DOES NOT LIKE YOU YOUR SELF RESPECT DEFIES YOU TO LIKE HIM HE HAS
ALWAYS SEEN YOU TO DISADVANTAGE HE ALWAYS WILL SEE YOU TO DISADVANTAGE
YOUR POSITIONS ARE UNEQUAL AND WERE THEY ON THE SAME LEVEL YOUR
MINDS COULD NOT ASSIMILATE NEVER HOPE THEN TO GATHER THE HONEY OF
FRIENDSHIP OUT OF THAT THORN GUARDED PLANT
HELLO CRIMSWORTH WHERE ARE
YOUR THOUGHTS TENDING YOU LEAVE THE RECOLLECTION OF HUNSDEN AS A BEE
WOULD A ROCK AS A BIRD A DESERT AND YOUR ASPIRATIONS SPREAD EAGER
WINGS TOWARDS A LAND OF VISIONS WHERE NOW IN ADVANCING DAYLIGHT IN
X DAYLIGHT YOU DARE TO DREAM OF CONGENIALITY REPOSE UNION
THOSE
THREE YOU WILL NEVER MEET IN THIS WORLD THEY ARE ANGELS
THE SOULS OF
JUST MEN MADE PERFECT MAY ENCOUNTER THEM IN HEAVEN BUT YOUR SOUL WILL
NEVER BE MADE PERFECT
EIGHT O'CLOCK STRIKES YOUR HANDS ARE THAWED GET
TO WORK
WORK WHY SHOULD I WORK SAID I SULLENLY I CANNOT PLEASE THOUGH I
TOIL LIKE A SLAVE WORK WORK REITERATED THE INWARD VOICE
I MAY
WORK IT WILL DO NO GOOD I GROWLED BUT NEVERTHELESS I DREW OUT A
PACKET OF LETTERS AND COMMENCED MY TASK TASK THANKLESS AND BITTER AS
THAT OF THE ISRAELITE CRAWLING OVER THE SUN BAKED FIELDS OF EGYPT IN
SEARCH OF STRAW AND STUBBLE WHEREWITH TO ACCOMPLISH HIS TALE OF BRICKS
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK I HEARD MR
CRIMSWORTH'S GIG TURN INTO THE YARD AND
IN A MINUTE OR TWO HE ENTERED THE COUNTING HOUSE
IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO
GLANCE HIS EYE AT STEIGHTON AND MYSELF TO HANG UP HIS MACKINTOSH STAND
A MINUTE WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE AND THEN WALK OUT
TODAY HE DID
NOT DEVIATE FROM HIS USUAL HABITS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THAT WHEN
HE LOOKED AT ME HIS BROW INSTEAD OF BEING MERELY HARD WAS SURLY HIS
EYE INSTEAD OF BEING COLD WAS FIERCE
HE STUDIED ME A MINUTE OR TWO
LONGER THAN USUAL BUT WENT OUT IN SILENCE
TWELVE O'CLOCK ARRIVED THE BELL RANG FOR A SUSPENSION OF LABOUR THE
WORKPEOPLE WENT OFF TO THEIR DINNERS STEIGHTON TOO DEPARTED DESIRING
ME TO LOCK THE COUNTING HOUSE DOOR AND TAKE THE KEY WITH ME
I
WAS TYING UP A BUNDLE OF PAPERS AND PUTTING THEM IN THEIR PLACE
PREPARATORY TO CLOSING MY DESK WHEN CRIMSWORTH REAPPEARED AT THE DOOR
AND ENTERING CLOSED IT BEHIND HIM
YOU'LL STAY HERE A MINUTE SAID HE IN A DEEP BRUTAL VOICE WHILE HIS
NOSTRILS DISTENDED AND HIS EYE SHOT A SPARK OF SINISTER FIRE
ALONE WITH EDWARD I REMEMBERED OUR RELATIONSHIP AND REMEMBERING THAT
FORGOT THE DIFFERENCE OF POSITION I PUT AWAY DEFERENCE AND CAREFUL
FORMS OF SPEECH I ANSWERED WITH SIMPLE BREVITY
IT IS TIME TO GO HOME I SAID TURNING THE KEY IN MY DESK
YOU'LL STAY HERE HE REITERATED
AND TAKE YOUR HAND OFF THAT KEY
LEAVE IT IN THE LOCK
WHY ASKED I
WHAT CAUSE IS THERE FOR CHANGING MY USUAL PLANS
DO AS I ORDER WAS THE ANSWER AND NO QUESTIONS YOU ARE MY SERVANT
OBEY ME WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABOUT HE WAS GOING ON IN THE SAME
BREATH WHEN AN ABRUPT PAUSE ANNOUNCED THAT RAGE HAD FOR THE MOMENT GOT
THE BETTER OF ARTICULATION
YOU MAY LOOK IF YOU WISH TO KNOW I REPLIED
THERE IS THE OPEN DESK
THERE ARE THE PAPERS
CONFOUND YOUR INSOLENCE WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABOUT
YOUR WORK AND HAVE DONE IT WELL
HYPOCRITE AND TWADDLER SMOOTH FACED SNIVELLING GREASEHORN THIS
LAST TERM IS I BELIEVE PURELY SHIRE AND ALLUDES TO THE HORN OF
BLACK RANCID WHALE OIL USUALLY TO BE SEEN SUSPENDED TO CART WHEELS
AND EMPLOYED FOR GREASING THE SAME
COME EDWARD CRIMSWORTH ENOUGH OF THIS
IT IS TIME YOU AND I WOUND UP
ACCOUNTS
I HAVE NOW GIVEN YOUR SERVICE THREE MONTHS' TRIAL AND I FIND
IT THE MOST NAUSEOUS SLAVERY UNDER THE SUN
SEEK ANOTHER CLERK
I STAY
NO LONGER
WHAT DO YOU DARE TO GIVE ME NOTICE STOP AT LEAST FOR YOUR WAGES HE
TOOK DOWN THE HEAVY GIG WHIP HANGING BESIDE HIS MACKINTOSH
I PERMITTED MYSELF TO LAUGH WITH A DEGREE OF SCORN I TOOK NO PAINS TO
TEMPER OR HIDE
HIS FURY BOILED UP AND WHEN HE HAD SWORN HALF A DOZEN
VULGAR IMPIOUS OATHS WITHOUT HOWEVER VENTURING TO LIFT THE WHIP HE
CONTINUED
I'VE FOUND YOU OUT AND KNOW YOU THOROUGHLY YOU MEAN WHINING
LICKSPITTLE WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SAYING ALL OVER X ABOUT ME ANSWER
ME THAT
YOU I HAVE NEITHER INCLINATION NOR TEMPTATION TO TALK ABOUT YOU
YOU LIE IT IS YOUR PRACTICE TO TALK ABOUT ME IT IS YOUR CONSTANT
HABIT TO MAKE PUBLIC COMPLAINT OF THE TREATMENT YOU RECEIVE AT MY HANDS
YOU HAVE GONE AND TOLD IT FAR AND NEAR THAT I GIVE YOU LOW WAGES AND
KNOCK YOU ABOUT LIKE A DOG
I WISH YOU WERE A DOG I'D SET TO THIS
MINUTE AND NEVER STIR FROM THE SPOT TILL I'D CUT EVERY STRIP OF FLESH
FROM YOUR BONES WITH THIS WHIP
HE FLOURISHED HIS TOOL
THE END OF THE LASH JUST TOUCHED MY FOREHEAD
A WARM EXCITED THRILL RAN THROUGH MY VEINS MY BLOOD SEEMED TO GIVE A
BOUND AND THEN RACED FAST AND HOT ALONG ITS CHANNELS
I GOT UP NIMBLY
CAME ROUND TO WHERE HE STOOD AND FACED HIM
DOWN WITH YOUR WHIP SAID I AND EXPLAIN THIS INSTANT WHAT YOU MEAN
SIRRAH TO WHOM ARE YOU SPEAKING
TO YOU
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE PRESENT I THINK
YOU SAY I HAVE BEEN
CALUMNIATING YOU COMPLAINING OF YOUR LOW WAGES AND BAD TREATMENT
GIVE
YOUR GROUNDS FOR THESE ASSERTIONS
CRIMSWORTH HAD NO DIGNITY AND WHEN I STERNLY DEMANDED AN EXPLANATION
HE GAVE ONE IN A LOUD SCOLDING VOICE
GROUNDS YOU SHALL HAVE THEM AND TURN TO THE LIGHT THAT I MAY SEE YOUR
BRAZEN FACE BLUSH BLACK WHEN YOU HEAR YOURSELF PROVED TO BE A LIAR AND
A HYPOCRITE
AT A PUBLIC MEETING IN THE TOWN HALL YESTERDAY I HAD THE
PLEASURE OF HEARING MYSELF INSULTED BY THE SPEAKER OPPOSED TO ME IN THE
QUESTION UNDER DISCUSSION BY ALLUSIONS TO MY PRIVATE AFFAIRS BY CANT
ABOUT MONSTERS WITHOUT NATURAL AFFECTION FAMILY DESPOTS AND SUCH
TRASH AND WHEN I ROSE TO ANSWER I WAS MET BY A SHOUT FROM THE FILTHY
MOB WHERE THE MENTION OF YOUR NAME ENABLED ME AT ONCE TO DETECT THE
QUARTER IN WHICH THIS BASE ATTACK HAD ORIGINATED
WHEN I LOOKED ROUND I
SAW THAT TREACHEROUS VILLAIN HUNSDEN ACTING AS FUGLEMAN
I DETECTED YOU
IN CLOSE CONVERSATION WITH HUNSDEN AT MY HOUSE A MONTH AGO AND I KNOW
THAT YOU WERE AT HUNSDEN'S ROOMS LAST NIGHT
DENY IT IF YOU DARE
OH I SHALL NOT DENY IT AND IF HUNSDEN HOUNDED ON THE PEOPLE TO HISS
YOU HE DID QUITE RIGHT
YOU DESERVE POPULAR EXECRATION FOR A WORSE
MAN A HARDER MASTER A MORE BRUTAL BROTHER THAN YOU ARE HAS SELDOM
EXISTED
SIRRAH SIRRAH REITERATED CRIMSWORTH AND TO COMPLETE HIS APOSTROPHE
HE CRACKED THE WHIP STRAIGHT OVER MY HEAD
A MINUTE SUFFICED TO WREST IT FROM HIM BREAK IT IN TWO PIECES AND
THROW IT UNDER THE GRATE
HE MADE A HEADLONG RUSH AT ME WHICH I EVADED
AND SAID
TOUCH ME AND I'LL HAVE YOU UP BEFORE THE NEAREST MAGISTRATE
MEN LIKE CRIMSWORTH IF FIRMLY AND CALMLY RESISTED ALWAYS ABATE
SOMETHING OF THEIR EXORBITANT INSOLENCE HE HAD NO MIND TO BE BROUGHT
BEFORE A MAGISTRATE AND I SUPPOSE HE SAW I MEANT WHAT I SAID
AFTER
AN ODD AND LONG STARE AT ME AT ONCE BULL LIKE AND AMAZED HE SEEMED
TO BETHINK HIMSELF THAT AFTER ALL HIS MONEY GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT
SUPERIORITY OVER A BEGGAR LIKE ME AND THAT HE HAD IN HIS HANDS A SURER
AND MORE DIGNIFIED MODE OF REVENGE THAN THE SOMEWHAT HAZARDOUS ONE OF
PERSONAL CHASTISEMENT
TAKE YOUR HAT SAID HE
TAKE WHAT BELONGS TO YOU AND GO OUT AT
THAT DOOR GET AWAY TO YOUR PARISH YOU PAUPER BEG STEAL STARVE GET
TRANSPORTED DO WHAT YOU LIKE BUT AT YOUR PERIL VENTURE AGAIN INTO
MY SIGHT IF EVER I HEAR OF YOUR SETTING FOOT ON AN INCH OF GROUND
BELONGING TO ME I'LL HIRE A MAN TO CANE YOU
IT IS NOT LIKELY YOU'LL HAVE THE CHANCE ONCE OFF YOUR PREMISES WHAT
TEMPTATION CAN I HAVE TO RETURN TO THEM I LEAVE A PRISON I LEAVE A
TYRANT I LEAVE WHAT IS WORSE THAN THE WORST THAT CAN LIE BEFORE ME SO
NO FEAR OF MY COMING BACK
GO OR I'LL MAKE YOU EXCLAIMED CRIMSWORTH
I WALKED DELIBERATELY TO MY DESK TOOK OUT SUCH OF ITS CONTENTS AS WERE
MY OWN PROPERTY PUT THEM IN MY POCKET LOCKED THE DESK AND PLACED THE
KEY ON THE TOP
WHAT ARE YOU ABSTRACTING FROM THAT DESK DEMANDED THE MILLOWNER
LEAVE ALL BEHIND IN ITS PLACE OR I'LL SEND FOR A POLICEMAN TO SEARCH
YOU
LOOK SHARP ABOUT IT THEN SAID I AND I TOOK DOWN MY HAT DREW ON MY
GLOVES AND WALKED LEISURELY OUT OF THE COUNTING HOUSE WALKED OUT OF IT
TO ENTER IT NO MORE
I RECOLLECT THAT WHEN THE MILL BELL RANG THE DINNER HOUR BEFORE MR
CRIMSWORTH ENTERED AND THE SCENE ABOVE RELATED TOOK PLACE I HAD HAD
RATHER A SHARP APPETITE AND HAD BEEN WAITING SOMEWHAT IMPATIENTLY TO
HEAR THE SIGNAL OF FEEDING TIME
I FORGOT IT NOW HOWEVER THE IMAGES
OF POTATOES AND ROAST MUTTON WERE EFFACED FROM MY MIND BY THE STIR AND
TUMULT WHICH THE TRANSACTION OF THE LAST HALF HOUR HAD THERE EXCITED
I
ONLY THOUGHT OF WALKING THAT THE ACTION OF MY MUSCLES MIGHT HARMONIZE
WITH THE ACTION OF MY NERVES AND WALK I DID FAST AND FAR
HOW COULD
I DO OTHERWISE A LOAD WAS LIFTED OFF MY HEART I FELT LIGHT AND
LIBERATED
I HAD GOT AWAY FROM BIGBEN CLOSE WITHOUT A BREACH OF
RESOLUTION WITHOUT INJURY TO MY SELF RESPECT
I HAD NOT FORCED
CIRCUMSTANCES CIRCUMSTANCES HAD FREED ME
LIFE WAS AGAIN OPEN TO ME
NO LONGER WAS ITS HORIZON LIMITED BY THE HIGH BLACK WALL SURROUNDING
CRIMSWORTH'S MILL
TWO HOURS HAD ELAPSED BEFORE MY SENSATIONS HAD SO FAR
SUBSIDED AS TO LEAVE ME CALM ENOUGH TO REMARK FOR WHAT WIDER AND CLEARER
BOUNDARIES I HAD EXCHANGED THAT SOOTY GIRDLE
WHEN I DID LOOK UP LO
STRAIGHT BEFORE ME LAY GROVETOWN A VILLAGE OF VILLAS ABOUT FIVE MILES
OUT OF X
THE SHORT WINTER DAY AS I PERCEIVED FROM THE FAR DECLINED
SUN WAS ALREADY APPROACHING ITS CLOSE A CHILL FROST MIST WAS RISING
FROM THE RIVER ON WHICH X STANDS AND ALONG WHOSE BANKS THE ROAD I
HAD TAKEN LAY IT DIMMED THE EARTH BUT DID NOT OBSCURE THE CLEAR ICY
BLUE OF THE JANUARY SKY
THERE WAS A GREAT STILLNESS NEAR AND FAR THE
TIME OF THE DAY FAVOURED TRANQUILLITY AS THE PEOPLE WERE ALL EMPLOYED
WITHIN DOORS THE HOUR OF EVENING RELEASE FROM THE FACTORIES NOT BEING
YET ARRIVED A SOUND OF FULL FLOWING WATER ALONE PERVADED THE AIR FOR
THE RIVER WAS DEEP AND ABUNDANT SWELLED BY THE MELTING OF A LATE SNOW
I STOOD AWHILE LEANING OVER A WALL AND LOOKING DOWN AT THE CURRENT
I WATCHED THE RAPID RUSH OF ITS WAVES
I DESIRED MEMORY TO TAKE A CLEAR
AND PERMANENT IMPRESSION OF THE SCENE AND TREASURE IT FOR FUTURE YEARS
GROVETOWN CHURCH CLOCK STRUCK FOUR LOOKING UP I BEHELD THE LAST OF
THAT DAY'S SUN GLINTING RED THROUGH THE LEAFLESS BOUGHS OF SOME
VERY OLD OAK TREES SURROUNDING THE CHURCH ITS LIGHT COLOURED AND
CHARACTERIZED THE PICTURE AS I WISHED
I PAUSED YET A MOMENT TILL THE
SWEET SLOW SOUND OF THE BELL HAD QUITE DIED OUT OF THE AIR THEN EAR
EYE AND FEELING SATISFIED I QUITTED THE WALL AND ONCE MORE TURNED MY
FACE TOWARDS X
CHAPTER VI
I RE ENTERED THE TOWN A HUNGRY MAN THE DINNER I HAD FORGOTTEN RECURRED
SEDUCTIVELY TO MY RECOLLECTION AND IT WAS WITH A QUICK STEP AND SHARP
APPETITE I ASCENDED THE NARROW STREET LEADING TO MY LODGINGS
IT WAS
DARK WHEN I OPENED THE FRONT DOOR AND WALKED INTO THE HOUSE
I WONDERED
HOW MY FIRE WOULD BE THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND I SHUDDERED AT THE
PROSPECT OF A GRATE FULL OF SPARKLESS CINDERS
TO MY JOYFUL SURPRISE
I FOUND ON ENTERING MY SITTING ROOM A GOOD FIRE AND A CLEAN HEARTH
I HAD HARDLY NOTICED THIS PHENOMENON WHEN I BECAME AWARE OF ANOTHER
SUBJECT FOR WONDERMENT THE CHAIR I USUALLY OCCUPIED NEAR THE HEARTH WAS
ALREADY FILLED A PERSON SAT THERE WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED ON HIS CHEST
AND HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT ON THE RUG
SHORT SIGHTED AS I AM DOUBTFUL
AS WAS THE GLEAM OF THE FIRELIGHT A MOMENT'S EXAMINATION ENABLED ME TO
RECOGNIZE IN THIS PERSON MY ACQUAINTANCE MR
HUNSDEN
I COULD NOT OF
COURSE BE MUCH PLEASED TO SEE HIM CONSIDERING THE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD
PARTED FROM HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND AS I WALKED TO THE HEARTH STIRRED
THE FIRE AND SAID COOLLY GOOD EVENING MY DEMEANOUR EVINCED AS
LITTLE CORDIALITY AS I FELT YET I WONDERED IN MY OWN MIND WHAT HAD
BROUGHT HIM THERE AND I WONDERED ALSO WHAT MOTIVES HAD INDUCED HIM TO
INTERFERE SO ACTIVELY BETWEEN ME AND EDWARD IT WAS TO HIM IT APPEARED
THAT I OWED MY WELCOME DISMISSAL STILL I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO
ASK HIM QUESTIONS TO SHOW ANY EAGERNESS OF CURIOSITY IF HE CHOSE TO
EXPLAIN HE MIGHT BUT THE EXPLANATION SHOULD BE A PERFECTLY VOLUNTARY
ONE ON HIS PART I THOUGHT HE WAS ENTERING UPON IT
YOU OWE ME A DEBT OF GRATITUDE WERE HIS FIRST WORDS
DO I SAID I I HOPE IT IS NOT A LARGE ONE FOR I AM MUCH TOO POOR TO
CHARGE MYSELF WITH HEAVY LIABILITIES OF ANY KIND
THEN DECLARE YOURSELF BANKRUPT AT ONCE FOR THIS LIABILITY IS A TON
WEIGHT AT LEAST
WHEN I CAME IN I FOUND YOUR FIRE OUT AND I HAD IT LIT
AGAIN AND MADE THAT SULKY DRAB OF A SERVANT STAY AND BLOW AT IT WITH
THE BELLOWS TILL IT HAD BURNT UP PROPERLY NOW SAY 'THANK YOU
NOT TILL I HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO EAT I CAN THANK NOBODY WHILE I AM SO
FAMISHED
I RANG THE BELL AND ORDERED TEA AND SOME COLD MEAT
COLD MEAT EXCLAIMED HUNSDEN AS THE SERVANT CLOSED THE DOOR WHAT A
GLUTTON YOU ARE MAN MEAT WITH TEA YOU'LL DIE OF EATING TOO MUCH
NO MR
HUNSDEN I SHALL NOT I FELT A NECESSITY FOR CONTRADICTING
HIM I WAS IRRITATED WITH HUNGER AND IRRITATED AT SEEING HIM THERE AND
IRRITATED AT THE CONTINUED ROUGHNESS OF HIS MANNER
IT IS OVER EATING THAT MAKES YOU SO ILL TEMPERED SAID HE
HOW DO YOU KNOW I DEMANDED
IT IS LIKE YOU TO GIVE A PRAGMATICAL
OPINION WITHOUT BEING ACQUAINTED WITH ANY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE
CASE I HAVE HAD NO DINNER
WHAT I SAID WAS PETULANT AND SNAPPISH ENOUGH AND HUNSDEN ONLY REPLIED
BY LOOKING IN MY FACE AND LAUGHING
POOR THING HE WHINED AFTER A PAUSE
IT HAS HAD NO DINNER HAS IT
WHAT I SUPPOSE ITS MASTER WOULD NOT LET IT COME HOME
DID CRIMSWORTH
ORDER YOU TO FAST BY WAY OF PUNISHMENT WILLIAM
NO MR
HUNSDEN FORTUNATELY AT THIS SULKY JUNCTURE TEA WAS BROUGHT
IN AND I FELL TO UPON SOME BREAD AND BUTTER AND COLD BEEF DIRECTLY
HAVING CLEARED A PLATEFUL I BECAME SO FAR HUMANIZED AS TO INTIMATE TO
MR
HUNSDEN THAT HE NEED NOT SIT THERE STARING BUT MIGHT COME TO THE
TABLE AND DO AS I DID IF HE LIKED
BUT I DON'T LIKE IN THE LEAST SAID HE AND THEREWITH HE SUMMONED THE
SERVANT BY A FRESH PULL OF THE BELL ROPE AND INTIMATED A DESIRE TO
HAVE A GLASS OF TOAST AND WATER
AND SOME MORE COAL HE ADDED MR
CRIMSWORTH SHALL KEEP A GOOD FIRE WHILE I STAY
HIS ORDERS BEING EXECUTED HE WHEELED HIS CHAIR ROUND TO THE TABLE SO
AS TO BE OPPOSITE ME
WELL HE PROCEEDED
YOU ARE OUT OF WORK I SUPPOSE
YES SAID I AND NOT DISPOSED TO SHOW THE SATISFACTION I FELT ON THIS
POINT I YIELDING TO THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT TOOK UP THE SUBJECT AS
THOUGH I CONSIDERED MYSELF AGGRIEVED RATHER THAN BENEFITED BY WHAT HAD
BEEN DONE
YES THANKS TO YOU I AM
CRIMSWORTH TURNED ME OFF AT
A MINUTE'S NOTICE OWING TO SOME INTERFERENCE OF YOURS AT A PUBLIC
MEETING I UNDERSTAND
AH WHAT HE MENTIONED THAT HE OBSERVED ME SIGNALLING THE LADS DID
HE WHAT HAD HE TO SAY ABOUT HIS FRIEND HUNSDEN ANYTHING SWEET
HE CALLED YOU A TREACHEROUS VILLAIN
OH HE HARDLY KNOWS ME YET I'M ONE OF THOSE SHY PEOPLE WHO DON'T COME
OUT ALL AT ONCE AND HE IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO MAKE MY ACQUAINTANCE
BUT HE'LL FIND I'VE SOME GOOD QUALITIES EXCELLENT ONES THE HUNSDENS
WERE ALWAYS UNRIVALLED AT TRACKING A RASCAL A DOWNRIGHT DISHONOURABLE
VILLAIN IS THEIR NATURAL PREY THEY COULD NOT KEEP OFF HIM WHEREVER
THEY MET HIM YOU USED THE WORD PRAGMATICAL JUST NOW THAT WORD IS THE
PROPERTY OF OUR FAMILY IT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO US FROM GENERATION TO
GENERATION WE HAVE FINE NOSES FOR ABUSES WE SCENT A SCOUNDREL A MILE
OFF WE ARE REFORMERS BORN RADICAL REFORMERS AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR
ME TO LIVE IN THE SAME TOWN WITH CRIMSWORTH TO COME INTO WEEKLY CONTACT
WITH HIM TO WITNESS SOME OF HIS CONDUCT TO YOU FOR WHOM PERSONALLY
I CARE NOTHING I ONLY CONSIDER THE BRUTAL INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE
VIOLATED YOUR NATURAL CLAIM TO EQUALITY I SAY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR
ME TO BE THUS SITUATED AND NOT FEEL THE ANGEL OR THE DEMON OF MY RACE
AT WORK WITHIN ME
I FOLLOWED MY INSTINCT OPPOSED A TYRANT AND BROKE A
CHAIN
NOW THIS SPEECH INTERESTED ME MUCH BOTH BECAUSE IT BROUGHT OUT
HUNSDEN'S CHARACTER AND BECAUSE IT EXPLAINED HIS MOTIVES IT INTERESTED
ME SO MUCH THAT I FORGOT TO REPLY TO IT AND SAT SILENT PONDERING OVER
A THRONG OF IDEAS IT HAD SUGGESTED
ARE YOU GRATEFUL TO ME HE ASKED PRESENTLY
IN FACT I WAS GRATEFUL OR ALMOST SO AND I BELIEVE I HALF LIKED HIM AT
THE MOMENT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PROVISO THAT WHAT HE HAD DONE WAS NOT
OUT OF REGARD FOR ME
BUT HUMAN NATURE IS PERVERSE
IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER
HIS BLUNT QUESTION IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SO I DISCLAIMED ALL TENDENCY
TO GRATITUDE AND ADVISED HIM IF HE EXPECTED ANY REWARD FOR HIS
CHAMPIONSHIP TO LOOK FOR IT IN A BETTER WORLD AS HE WAS NOT LIKELY
TO MEET WITH IT HERE
IN REPLY HE TERMED ME A DRY HEARTED ARISTOCRATIC
SCAMP WHEREUPON I AGAIN CHARGED HIM WITH HAVING TAKEN THE BREAD OUT OF
MY MOUTH
YOUR BREAD WAS DIRTY MAN CRIED HUNSDEN DIRTY AND UNWHOLESOME
IT CAME THROUGH THE HANDS OF A TYRANT FOR I TELL YOU CRIMSWORTH IS A
TYRANT A TYRANT TO HIS WORKPEOPLE A TYRANT TO HIS CLERKS AND WILL
SOME DAY BE A TYRANT TO HIS WIFE
NONSENSE BREAD IS BREAD AND A SALARY IS A SALARY
I'VE LOST MINE AND
THROUGH YOUR MEANS
THERE'S SENSE IN WHAT YOU SAY AFTER ALL REJOINED HUNSDEN
I MUST
SAY I AM RATHER AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU MAKE SO PRACTICAL
AN OBSERVATION AS THAT LAST
I HAD IMAGINED NOW FROM MY PREVIOUS
OBSERVATION OF YOUR CHARACTER THAT THE SENTIMENTAL DELIGHT YOU WOULD
HAVE TAKEN IN YOUR NEWLY REGAINED LIBERTY WOULD FOR A WHILE AT LEAST
HAVE EFFACED ALL IDEAS OF FORETHOUGHT AND PRUDENCE
I THINK BETTER OF
YOU FOR LOOKING STEADILY TO THE NEEDFUL
LOOKING STEADILY TO THE NEEDFUL HOW CAN I DO OTHERWISE I MUST LIVE
AND TO LIVE I MUST HAVE WHAT YOU CALL 'THE NEEDFUL WHICH I CAN ONLY
GET BY WORKING
I REPEAT IT YOU HAVE TAKEN MY WORK FROM ME
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO PURSUED HUNSDEN COOLLY
YOU HAVE INFLUENTIAL
RELATIONS I SUPPOSE THEY'LL SOON PROVIDE YOU WITH ANOTHER PLACE
INFLUENTIAL RELATIONS WHO I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THEIR NAMES
THE SEACOMBES
STUFF I HAVE CUT THEM
HUNSDEN LOOKED AT ME INCREDULOUSLY
I HAVE SAID I AND THAT DEFINITIVELY
YOU MUST MEAN THEY HAVE CUT YOU WILLIAM
AS YOU PLEASE
THEY OFFERED ME THEIR PATRONAGE ON CONDITION OF MY
ENTERING THE CHURCH I DECLINED BOTH THE TERMS AND THE RECOMPENCE I
WITHDREW FROM MY COLD UNCLES AND PREFERRED THROWING MYSELF INTO MY
ELDER BROTHER'S ARMS FROM WHOSE AFFECTIONATE EMBRACE I AM NOW TORN BY
THE CRUEL INTERMEDDLING OF A STRANGER OF YOURSELF IN SHORT
I COULD NOT REPRESS A HALF SMILE AS I SAID THIS A SIMILAR
DEMI MANIFESTATION OF FEELING APPEARED AT THE SAME MOMENT ON HUNSDEN'S
LIPS
OH I SEE SAID HE LOOKING INTO MY EYES AND IT WAS EVIDENT HE DID
SEE RIGHT DOWN INTO MY HEART
HAVING SAT A MINUTE OR TWO WITH HIS CHIN
RESTING ON HIS HAND DILIGENTLY OCCUPIED IN THE CONTINUED PERUSAL OF MY
COUNTENANCE HE WENT ON
SERIOUSLY HAVE YOU THEN NOTHING TO EXPECT FROM THE SEACOMBES
YES REJECTION AND REPULSION
WHY DO YOU ASK ME TWICE HOW CAN HANDS
STAINED WITH THE INK OF A COUNTING HOUSE SOILED WITH THE GREASE OF
A WOOL WAREHOUSE EVER AGAIN BE PERMITTED TO COME INTO CONTACT WITH
ARISTOCRATIC PALMS
THERE WOULD BE A DIFFICULTY NO DOUBT STILL YOU ARE SUCH A COMPLETE
SEACOMBE IN APPEARANCE FEATURE LANGUAGE ALMOST MANNER I WONDER THEY
SHOULD DISOWN YOU
THEY HAVE DISOWNED ME SO TALK NO MORE ABOUT IT
DO YOU REGRET IT WILLIAM
NO
WHY NOT LAD
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PEOPLE WITH WHOM I COULD EVER HAVE HAD ANY
SYMPATHY
I SAY YOU ARE ONE OF THEM
THAT MERELY PROVES THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT IT I AM MY
MOTHER'S SON BUT NOT MY UNCLES' NEPHEW
STILL ONE OF YOUR UNCLES IS A LORD THOUGH RATHER AN OBSCURE AND NOT A
VERY WEALTHY ONE AND THE OTHER A RIGHT HONOURABLE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
WORLDLY INTEREST
NONSENSE MR
HUNSDEN
YOU KNOW OR MAY KNOW THAT EVEN HAD I DESIRED TO
BE SUBMISSIVE TO MY UNCLES I COULD NOT HAVE STOOPED WITH A GOOD ENOUGH
GRACE EVER TO HAVE WON THEIR FAVOUR
I SHOULD HAVE SACRIFICED MY OWN
COMFORT AND NOT HAVE GAINED THEIR PATRONAGE IN RETURN
VERY LIKELY SO YOU CALCULATED YOUR WISEST PLAN WAS TO FOLLOW YOUR OWN
DEVICES AT ONCE
EXACTLY
I MUST FOLLOW MY OWN DEVICES I MUST TILL THE DAY OF MY
DEATH BECAUSE I CAN NEITHER COMPREHEND ADOPT NOR WORK OUT THOSE OF
OTHER PEOPLE
HUNSDEN YAWNED
WELL SAID HE IN ALL THIS I SEE BUT ONE THING
CLEARLY THAT IS THAT THE WHOLE AFFAIR IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE HE
STRETCHED HIMSELF AND AGAIN YAWNED
I WONDER WHAT TIME IT IS HE WENT
ON I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT FOR SEVEN O'CLOCK
THREE QUARTERS PAST SIX BY MY WATCH
WELL THEN I'LL GO HE GOT UP
YOU'LL NOT MEDDLE WITH TRADE AGAIN
SAID HE LEANING HIS ELBOW ON THE MANTELPIECE
NO I THINK NOT
YOU WOULD BE A FOOL IF YOU DID
PROBABLY AFTER ALL YOU'LL THINK
BETTER OF YOUR UNCLES' PROPOSAL AND GO INTO THE CHURCH
A SINGULAR REGENERATION MUST TAKE PLACE IN MY WHOLE INNER AND OUTER MAN
BEFORE I DO THAT
A GOOD CLERGYMAN IS ONE OF THE BEST OF MEN
INDEED DO YOU THINK SO INTERRUPTED HUNSDEN SCOFFINGLY
I DO AND NO MISTAKE
BUT I HAVE NOT THE PECULIAR POINTS WHICH GO TO
MAKE A GOOD CLERGYMAN AND RATHER THAN ADOPT A PROFESSION FOR WHICH I
HAVE NO VOCATION I WOULD ENDURE EXTREMITIES OF HARDSHIP FROM POVERTY
YOU'RE A MIGHTY DIFFICULT CUSTOMER TO SUIT
YOU WON'T BE A TRADESMAN
OR A PARSON YOU CAN'T BE A LAWYER OR A DOCTOR OR A GENTLEMAN BECAUSE
YOU'VE NO MONEY
I'D RECOMMEND YOU TO TRAVEL
WHAT WITHOUT MONEY
YOU MUST TRAVEL IN SEARCH OF MONEY MAN
YOU CAN SPEAK FRENCH WITH
A VILE ENGLISH ACCENT NO DOUBT STILL YOU CAN SPEAK IT
GO ON TO THE
CONTINENT AND SEE WHAT WILL TURN UP FOR YOU THERE
GOD KNOWS I SHOULD LIKE TO GO EXCLAIMED I WITH INVOLUNTARY ARDOUR
GO WHAT THE DEUCE HINDERS YOU YOU MAY GET TO BRUSSELS FOR INSTANCE
FOR FIVE OR SIX POUNDS IF YOU KNOW HOW TO MANAGE WITH ECONOMY
NECESSITY WOULD TEACH ME IF I DIDN'T
GO THEN AND LET YOUR WITS MAKE A WAY FOR YOU WHEN YOU GET THERE
I
KNOW BRUSSELS ALMOST AS WELL AS I KNOW X AND I AM SURE IT WOULD
SUIT SUCH A ONE AS YOU BETTER THAN LONDON
BUT OCCUPATION MR
HUNSDEN I MUST GO WHERE OCCUPATION IS TO BE HAD
AND HOW COULD I GET RECOMMENDATION OR INTRODUCTION OR EMPLOYMENT AT
BRUSSELS
THERE SPEAKS THE ORGAN OF CAUTION
YOU HATE TO ADVANCE A STEP BEFORE
YOU KNOW EVERY INCH OF THE WAY
YOU HAVEN'T A SHEET OF PAPER AND A
PEN AND INK
I HOPE SO AND I PRODUCED WRITING MATERIALS WITH ALACRITY FOR I
GUESSED WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO
HE SAT DOWN WROTE A FEW LINES FOLDED
SEALED AND ADDRESSED A LETTER AND HELD IT OUT TO ME
THERE PRUDENCE THERE'S A PIONEER TO HEW DOWN THE FIRST ROUGH
DIFFICULTIES OF YOUR PATH
I KNOW WELL ENOUGH LAD YOU ARE NOT ONE OF
THOSE WHO WILL RUN THEIR NECK INTO A NOOSE WITHOUT SEEING HOW THEY
ARE TO GET IT OUT AGAIN AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
A RECKLESS MAN IS
MY AVERSION AND NOTHING SHOULD EVER PERSUADE ME TO MEDDLE WITH THE
CONCERNS OF SUCH A ONE
THOSE WHO ARE RECKLESS FOR THEMSELVES ARE
GENERALLY TEN TIMES MORE SO FOR THEIR FRIENDS
THIS IS A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION I SUPPOSE SAID I TAKING THE
EPISTLE
YES
WITH THAT IN YOUR POCKET YOU WILL RUN NO RISK OF FINDING YOURSELF
IN A STATE OF ABSOLUTE DESTITUTION WHICH I KNOW YOU WILL REGARD AS A
DEGRADATION SO SHOULD I FOR THAT MATTER
THE PERSON TO WHOM YOU WILL
PRESENT IT GENERALLY HAS TWO OR THREE RESPECTABLE PLACES DEPENDING UPON
HIS RECOMMENDATION
THAT WILL JUST SUIT ME SAID I
WELL AND WHERE'S YOUR GRATITUDE DEMANDED MR
HUNSDEN DON'T YOU
KNOW HOW TO SAY 'THANK YOU
I'VE FIFTEEN POUNDS AND A WATCH WHICH MY GODMOTHER WHOM I NEVER SAW
GAVE ME EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO WAS MY RATHER IRRELEVANT ANSWER AND I
FURTHER AVOWED MYSELF A HAPPY MAN AND PROFESSED THAT I DID NOT ENVY ANY
BEING IN CHRISTENDOM
BUT YOUR GRATITUDE
I SHALL BE OFF PRESENTLY MR
HUNSDEN TO MORROW IF ALL BE WELL I'LL
NOT STAY A DAY LONGER IN X THAN I'M OBLIGED
VERY GOOD BUT IT WILL BE DECENT TO MAKE DUE ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR THE
ASSISTANCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED BE QUICK IT IS JUST GOING TO STRIKE
SEVEN I'M WAITING TO BE THANKED
JUST STAND OUT OF THE WAY WILL YOU MR
HUNSDEN I WANT A KEY THERE IS
ON THE CORNER OF THE MANTELPIECE
I'LL PACK MY PORTMANTEAU BEFORE I GO
TO BED
THE HOUSE CLOCK STRUCK SEVEN
THE LAD IS A HEATHEN SAID HUNSDEN AND TAKING HIS HAT FROM A
SIDEBOARD HE LEFT THE ROOM LAUGHING TO HIMSELF
I HAD HALF AN
INCLINATION TO FOLLOW HIM I REALLY INTENDED TO LEAVE X THE NEXT
MORNING AND SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF BIDDING
HIM GOOD BYE
THE FRONT DOOR BANGED TO
LET HIM GO SAID I WE SHALL MEET AGAIN SOME DAY
CHAPTER VII
READER PERHAPS YOU WERE NEVER IN BELGIUM HAPLY YOU DON'T KNOW THE
PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE COUNTRY YOU HAVE NOT ITS LINEAMENTS DEFINED UPON
YOUR MEMORY AS I HAVE THEM ON MINE
THREE NAY FOUR PICTURES LINE THE FOUR WALLED CELL WHERE ARE STORED FOR
ME THE RECORDS OF THE PAST
FIRST ETON
ALL IN THAT PICTURE IS IN FAR
PERSPECTIVE RECEDING DIMINUTIVE BUT FRESHLY COLOURED GREEN DEWY
WITH A SPRING SKY PILED WITH GLITTERING YET SHOWERY CLOUDS FOR MY
CHILDHOOD WAS NOT ALL SUNSHINE IT HAD ITS OVERCAST ITS COLD ITS
STORMY HOURS
SECOND X HUGE DINGY THE CANVAS CRACKED AND SMOKED
A YELLOW SKY SOOTY CLOUDS NO SUN NO AZURE THE VERDURE OF THE SUBURBS
BLIGHTED AND SULLIED A VERY DREARY SCENE
THIRD BELGIUM AND I WILL PAUSE BEFORE THIS LANDSCAPE
AS TO THE
FOURTH A CURTAIN COVERS IT WHICH I MAY HEREAFTER WITHDRAW OR MAY NOT
AS SUITS MY CONVENIENCE AND CAPACITY
AT ANY RATE FOR THE PRESENT IT
MUST HANG UNDISTURBED
BELGIUM NAME UNROMANTIC AND UNPOETIC YET NAME
THAT WHENEVER UTTERED HAS IN MY EAR A SOUND IN MY HEART AN ECHO SUCH
AS NO OTHER ASSEMBLAGE OF SYLLABLES HOWEVER SWEET OR CLASSIC CAN
PRODUCE
BELGIUM I REPEAT THE WORD NOW AS I SIT ALONE NEAR MIDNIGHT
IT STIRS MY WORLD OF THE PAST LIKE A SUMMONS TO RESURRECTION THE GRAVES
UNCLOSE THE DEAD ARE RAISED THOUGHTS FEELINGS MEMORIES THAT SLEPT
ARE SEEN BY ME ASCENDING FROM THE CLOUDS HALOED MOST OF THEM BUT WHILE
I GAZE ON THEIR VAPOURY FORMS AND STRIVE TO ASCERTAIN DEFINITELY THEIR
OUTLINE THE SOUND WHICH WAKENED THEM DIES AND THEY SINK EACH AND ALL
LIKE A LIGHT WREATH OF MIST ABSORBED IN THE MOULD RECALLED TO URNS
RESEALED IN MONUMENTS
FAREWELL LUMINOUS PHANTOMS
THIS IS BELGIUM READER
LOOK DON'T CALL THE PICTURE A FLAT OR A DULL
ONE IT WAS NEITHER FLAT NOR DULL TO ME WHEN I FIRST BEHELD IT
WHEN I
LEFT OSTEND ON A MILD FEBRUARY MORNING AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE ROAD
TO BRUSSELS NOTHING COULD LOOK VAPID TO ME
MY SENSE OF ENJOYMENT
POSSESSED AN EDGE WHETTED TO THE FINEST UNTOUCHED KEEN EXQUISITE
I WAS YOUNG I HAD GOOD HEALTH PLEASURE AND I HAD NEVER MET NO
INDULGENCE OF HERS HAD ENERVATED OR SATED ONE FACULTY OF MY NATURE
LIBERTY I CLASPED IN MY ARMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE INFLUENCE OF
HER SMILE AND EMBRACE REVIVED MY LIFE LIKE THE SUN AND THE WEST WIND
YES AT THAT EPOCH I FELT LIKE A MORNING TRAVELLER WHO DOUBTS NOT THAT
FROM THE HILL HE IS ASCENDING HE SHALL BEHOLD A GLORIOUS SUNRISE WHAT
IF THE TRACK BE STRAIT STEEP AND STONY HE SEES IT NOT HIS EYES ARE
FIXED ON THAT SUMMIT FLUSHED ALREADY FLUSHED AND GILDED AND HAVING
GAINED IT HE IS CERTAIN OF THE SCENE BEYOND
HE KNOWS THAT THE SUN WILL
FACE HIM THAT HIS CHARIOT IS EVEN NOW COMING OVER THE EASTERN HORIZON
AND THAT THE HERALD BREEZE HE FEELS ON HIS CHEEK IS OPENING FOR THE
GOD'S CAREER A CLEAR VAST PATH OF AZURE AMIDST CLOUDS SOFT AS PEARL
AND WARM AS FLAME
DIFFICULTY AND TOIL WERE TO BE MY LOT BUT SUSTAINED
BY ENERGY DRAWN ON BY HOPES AS BRIGHT AS VAGUE I DEEMED SUCH A LOT
NO HARDSHIP
I MOUNTED NOW THE HILL IN SHADE THERE WERE PEBBLES
INEQUALITIES BRIARS IN MY PATH BUT MY EYES WERE FIXED ON THE CRIMSON
PEAK ABOVE MY IMAGINATION WAS WITH THE REFULGENT FIRMAMENT BEYOND AND
I THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE STONES TURNING UNDER MY FEET OR OF THE THORNS
SCRATCHING MY FACE AND HANDS
I GAZED OFTEN AND ALWAYS WITH DELIGHT FROM THE WINDOW OF THE DILIGENCE
THESE BE IT REMEMBERED WERE NOT THE DAYS OF TRAINS AND RAILROADS
WELL AND WHAT DID I SEE I WILL TELL YOU FAITHFULLY
GREEN REEDY
SWAMPS FIELDS FERTILE BUT FLAT CULTIVATED IN PATCHES THAT MADE THEM
LOOK LIKE MAGNIFIED KITCHEN GARDENS BELTS OF CUT TREES FORMAL AS
POLLARD WILLOWS SKIRTING THE HORIZON NARROW CANALS GLIDING SLOW BY
THE ROAD SIDE PAINTED FLEMISH FARMHOUSES SOME VERY DIRTY HOVELS A
GRAY DEAD SKY WET ROAD WET FIELDS WET HOUSE TOPS NOT A BEAUTIFUL
SCARCELY A PICTURESQUE OBJECT MET MY EYE ALONG THE WHOLE ROUTE YET TO
ME ALL WAS BEAUTIFUL ALL WAS MORE THAN PICTURESQUE
IT CONTINUED FAIR
SO LONG AS DAYLIGHT LASTED THOUGH THE MOISTURE OF MANY PRECEDING DAMP
DAYS HAD SODDEN THE WHOLE COUNTRY AS IT GREW DARK HOWEVER THE RAIN
RECOMMENCED AND IT WAS THROUGH STREAMING AND STARLESS DARKNESS MY EYE
CAUGHT THE FIRST GLEAM OF THE LIGHTS OF BRUSSELS
I SAW LITTLE OF THE
CITY BUT ITS LIGHTS THAT NIGHT
HAVING ALIGHTED FROM THE DILIGENCE A
FIACRE CONVEYED ME TO THE HOTEL DE WHERE I HAD BEEN ADVISED BY A
FELLOW TRAVELLER TO PUT UP HAVING EATEN A TRAVELLER'S SUPPER I RETIRED
TO BED AND SLEPT A TRAVELLER'S SLEEP
NEXT MORNING I AWOKE FROM PROLONGED AND SOUND REPOSE WITH THE IMPRESSION
THAT I WAS YET IN X AND PERCEIVING IT TO BE BROAD DAYLIGHT I
STARTED UP IMAGINING THAT I HAD OVERSLEPT MYSELF AND SHOULD BE BEHIND
TIME AT THE COUNTING HOUSE
THE MOMENTARY AND PAINFUL SENSE OF RESTRAINT
VANISHED BEFORE THE REVIVED AND REVIVING CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM AS
THROWING BACK THE WHITE CURTAINS OF MY BED I LOOKED FORTH INTO A WIDE
LOFTY FOREIGN CHAMBER HOW DIFFERENT FROM THE SMALL AND DINGY THOUGH
NOT UNCOMFORTABLE APARTMENT I HAD OCCUPIED FOR A NIGHT OR TWO AT A
RESPECTABLE INN IN LONDON WHILE WAITING FOR THE SAILING OF THE PACKET
YET FAR BE IT FROM ME TO PROFANE THE MEMORY OF THAT LITTLE DINGY ROOM
IT TOO IS DEAR TO MY SOUL FOR THERE AS I LAY IN QUIET AND DARKNESS
I FIRST HEARD THE GREAT BELL OF ST
PAUL'S TELLING LONDON IT WAS
MIDNIGHT AND WELL DO I RECALL THE DEEP DELIBERATE TONES SO FULL
CHARGED WITH COLOSSAL PHLEGM AND FORCE
FROM THE SMALL NARROW WINDOW
OF THAT ROOM I FIRST SAW THE DOME LOOMING THROUGH A LONDON MIST
I
SUPPOSE THE SENSATIONS STIRRED BY THOSE FIRST SOUNDS FIRST SIGHTS ARE
FELT BUT ONCE TREASURE THEM MEMORY SEAL THEM IN URNS AND KEEP THEM
IN SAFE NICHES WELL I ROSE
TRAVELLERS TALK OF THE APARTMENTS IN
FOREIGN DWELLINGS BEING BARE AND UNCOMFORTABLE I THOUGHT MY CHAMBER
LOOKED STATELY AND CHEERFUL
IT HAD SUCH LARGE WINDOWS CROISEES THAT
OPENED LIKE DOORS WITH SUCH BROAD CLEAR PANES OF GLASS SUCH A GREAT
LOOKING GLASS STOOD ON MY DRESSING TABLE SUCH A FINE MIRROR GLITTERED
OVER THE MANTELPIECE THE PAINTED FLOOR LOOKED SO CLEAN AND GLOSSY
WHEN I HAD DRESSED AND WAS DESCENDING THE STAIRS THE BROAD MARBLE STEPS
ALMOST AWED ME AND SO DID THE LOFTY HALL INTO WHICH THEY CONDUCTED
ON THE FIRST LANDING I MET A FLEMISH HOUSEMAID SHE HAD WOODEN SHOES A
SHORT RED PETTICOAT A PRINTED COTTON BEDGOWN HER FACE WAS BROAD
HER PHYSIOGNOMY EMINENTLY STUPID WHEN I SPOKE TO HER IN FRENCH SHE
ANSWERED ME IN FLEMISH WITH AN AIR THE REVERSE OF CIVIL YET I THOUGHT
HER CHARMING IF SHE WAS NOT PRETTY OR POLITE SHE WAS I CONCEIVED
VERY PICTURESQUE SHE REMINDED ME OF THE FEMALE FIGURES IN CERTAIN DUTCH
PAINTINGS I HAD SEEN IN OTHER YEARS AT SEACOMBE HALL
I REPAIRED TO THE PUBLIC ROOM THAT TOO WAS VERY LARGE AND VERY LOFTY
AND WARMED BY A STOVE THE FLOOR WAS BLACK AND THE STOVE WAS BLACK AND
MOST OF THE FURNITURE WAS BLACK YET I NEVER EXPERIENCED A FREER
SENSE OF EXHILARATION THAN WHEN I SAT DOWN AT A VERY LONG BLACK TABLE
COVERED HOWEVER IN PART BY A WHITE CLOTH AND HAVING ORDERED
BREAKFAST BEGAN TO POUR OUT MY COFFEE FROM A LITTLE BLACK COFFEE POT
THE STOVE MIGHT BE DISMAL LOOKING TO SOME EYES NOT TO MINE BUT IT
WAS INDISPUTABLY VERY WARM AND THERE WERE TWO GENTLEMEN SEATED BY
IT TALKING IN FRENCH IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW THEIR RAPID UTTERANCE OR
COMPREHEND MUCH OF THE PURPORT OF WHAT THEY SAID YET FRENCH IN THE
MOUTHS OF FRENCHMEN OR BELGIANS I WAS NOT THEN SENSIBLE OF THE HORRORS
OF THE BELGIAN ACCENT WAS AS MUSIC TO MY EARS
ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN
PRESENTLY DISCERNED ME TO BE AN ENGLISHMAN NO DOUBT FROM THE FASHION IN
WHICH I ADDRESSED THE WAITER FOR I WOULD PERSIST IN SPEAKING FRENCH IN
MY EXECRABLE SOUTH OF ENGLAND STYLE THOUGH THE MAN UNDERSTOOD ENGLISH
THE GENTLEMAN AFTER LOOKING TOWARDS ME ONCE OR TWICE POLITELY ACCOSTED
ME IN VERY GOOD ENGLISH I REMEMBER I WISHED TO GOD THAT I COULD SPEAK
FRENCH AS WELL HIS FLUENCY AND CORRECT PRONUNCIATION IMPRESSED ME FOR
THE FIRST TIME WITH A DUE NOTION OF THE COSMOPOLITAN CHARACTER OF THE
CAPITAL I WAS IN IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THAT SKILL IN LIVING
LANGUAGES I AFTERWARDS FOUND TO BE SO GENERAL IN BRUSSELS
I LINGERED OVER MY BREAKFAST AS LONG AS I COULD WHILE IT WAS THERE
ON THE TABLE AND WHILE THAT STRANGER CONTINUED TALKING TO ME I WAS A
FREE INDEPENDENT TRAVELLER BUT AT LAST THE THINGS WERE REMOVED THE
TWO GENTLEMEN LEFT THE ROOM SUDDENLY THE ILLUSION CEASED REALITY AND
BUSINESS CAME BACK
I A BONDSMAN JUST RELEASED FROM THE YOKE FREED FOR
ONE WEEK FROM TWENTY ONE YEARS OF CONSTRAINT MUST OF NECESSITY RESUME
THE FETTERS OF DEPENDENCY
HARDLY HAD I TASTED THE DELIGHT OF BEING
WITHOUT A MASTER WHEN DUTY ISSUED HER STERN MANDATE GO FORTH AND SEEK
ANOTHER SERVICE I NEVER LINGER OVER A PAINFUL AND NECESSARY TASK I
NEVER TAKE PLEASURE BEFORE BUSINESS IT IS NOT IN MY NATURE TO DO SO
IMPOSSIBLE TO ENJOY A LEISURELY WALK OVER THE CITY THOUGH I PERCEIVED
THE MORNING WAS VERY FINE UNTIL I HAD FIRST PRESENTED MR
HUNSDEN'S
LETTER OF INTRODUCTION AND GOT FAIRLY ON TO THE TRACK OF A NEW
SITUATION
WRENCHING MY MIND FROM LIBERTY AND DELIGHT I SEIZED MY HAT
AND FORCED MY RELUCTANT BODY OUT OF THE HOTEL DE INTO THE FOREIGN
STREET
IT WAS A FINE DAY BUT I WOULD NOT LOOK AT THE BLUE SKY OR AT THE
STATELY HOUSES ROUND ME MY MIND WAS BENT ON ONE THING FINDING OUT MR
BROWN NUMERO RUE ROYALE FOR SO MY LETTER WAS ADDRESSED
BY DINT
OF INQUIRY I SUCCEEDED I STOOD AT LAST AT THE DESIRED DOOR KNOCKED
ASKED FOR MR
BROWN AND WAS ADMITTED
BEING SHOWN INTO A SMALL BREAKFAST ROOM I FOUND MYSELF IN THE
PRESENCE OF AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN VERY GRAVE BUSINESS LIKE AND
RESPECTABLE LOOKING
I PRESENTED MR
HUNSDEN'S LETTER HE RECEIVED ME
VERY CIVILLY
AFTER A LITTLE DESULTORY CONVERSATION HE ASKED ME IF THERE
WAS ANYTHING IN WHICH HIS ADVICE OR EXPERIENCE COULD BE OF USE
I SAID
YES AND THEN PROCEEDED TO TELL HIM THAT I WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN OF
FORTUNE TRAVELLING FOR PLEASURE BUT AN EX COUNTING HOUSE CLERK WHO
WANTED EMPLOYMENT OF SOME KIND AND THAT IMMEDIATELY TOO
HE REPLIED
THAT AS A FRIEND OF MR
HUNSDEN'S HE WOULD BE WILLING TO ASSIST ME AS
WELL AS HE COULD
AFTER SOME MEDITATION HE NAMED A PLACE IN A MERCANTILE
HOUSE AT LIEGE AND ANOTHER IN A BOOKSELLER'S SHOP AT LOUVAIN
CLERK AND SHOPMAN MURMURED I TO MYSELF
NO I SHOOK MY HEAD
I
HAD TRIED THE HIGH STOOL I HATED IT I BELIEVED THERE WERE OTHER
OCCUPATIONS THAT WOULD SUIT ME BETTER BESIDES I DID NOT WISH TO LEAVE
BRUSSELS
I KNOW OF NO PLACE IN BRUSSELS ANSWERED MR
BROWN UNLESS INDEED YOU
WERE DISPOSED TO TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO TEACHING
I AM ACQUAINTED WITH
THE DIRECTOR OF A LARGE ESTABLISHMENT WHO IS IN WANT OF A PROFESSOR OF
ENGLISH AND LATIN
I THOUGHT TWO MINUTES THEN I SEIZED THE IDEA EAGERLY
THE VERY THING SIR SAID I
BUT ASKED HE DO YOU UNDERSTAND FRENCH WELL ENOUGH TO TEACH BELGIAN
BOYS ENGLISH
FORTUNATELY I COULD ANSWER THIS QUESTION IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
HAVING STUDIED FRENCH UNDER A FRENCHMAN I COULD SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
INTELLIGIBLY THOUGH NOT FLUENTLY
I COULD ALSO READ IT WELL AND WRITE
IT DECENTLY
THEN PURSUED MR
BROWN I THINK I CAN PROMISE YOU THE PLACE FOR
MONSIEUR PELET WILL NOT REFUSE A PROFESSOR RECOMMENDED BY ME BUT COME
HERE AGAIN AT FIVE O'CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON AND I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO
HIM
THE WORD PROFESSOR STRUCK ME
I AM NOT A PROFESSOR SAID I
OH RETURNED MR
BROWN PROFESSOR HERE IN BELGIUM MEANS A TEACHER
THAT IS ALL
MY CONSCIENCE THUS QUIETED I THANKED MR
BROWN AND FOR THE PRESENT
WITHDREW
THIS TIME I STEPPED OUT INTO THE STREET WITH A RELIEVED HEART
THE TASK I HAD IMPOSED ON MYSELF FOR THAT DAY WAS EXECUTED
I MIGHT NOW
TAKE SOME HOURS OF HOLIDAY
I FELT FREE TO LOOK UP
FOR THE FIRST TIME
I REMARKED THE SPARKLING CLEARNESS OF THE AIR THE DEEP BLUE OF THE SKY
THE GAY CLEAN ASPECT OF THE WHITE WASHED OR PAINTED HOUSES I SAW WHAT
A FINE STREET WAS THE RUE ROYALE AND WALKING LEISURELY ALONG ITS BROAD
PAVEMENT I CONTINUED TO SURVEY ITS STATELY HOTELS TILL THE PALISADES
THE GATES AND TREES OF THE PARK APPEARING IN SIGHT OFFERED TO MY EYE A
NEW ATTRACTION
I REMEMBER BEFORE ENTERING THE PARK I STOOD AWHILE TO
CONTEMPLATE THE STATUE OF GENERAL BELLIARD AND THEN I ADVANCED TO THE
TOP OF THE GREAT STAIRCASE JUST BEYOND AND I LOOKED DOWN INTO A NARROW
BACK STREET WHICH I AFTERWARDS LEARNT WAS CALLED THE RUE D'ISABELLE
I WELL RECOLLECT THAT MY EYE RESTED ON THE GREEN DOOR OF A RATHER LARGE
HOUSE OPPOSITE WHERE ON A BRASS PLATE WAS INSCRIBED PENSIONNAT DE
DEMOISELLES PENSIONNAT THE WORD EXCITED AN UNEASY SENSATION IN
MY MIND IT SEEMED TO SPEAK OF RESTRAINT
SOME OF THE DEMOISELLES
EXTERNATS NO DOUBT WERE AT THAT MOMENT ISSUING FROM THE DOOR I LOOKED
FOR A PRETTY FACE AMONGST THEM BUT THEIR CLOSE LITTLE FRENCH BONNETS
HID THEIR FEATURES IN A MOMENT THEY WERE GONE
I HAD TRAVERSED A GOOD DEAL OF BRUSSELS BEFORE FIVE O'CLOCK ARRIVED
BUT PUNCTUALLY AS THAT HOUR STRUCK I WAS AGAIN IN THE RUE ROYALE
RE ADMITTED TO MR
BROWN'S BREAKFAST ROOM I FOUND HIM AS BEFORE
SEATED AT THE TABLE AND HE WAS NOT ALONE A GENTLEMAN STOOD BY THE
HEARTH
TWO WORDS OF INTRODUCTION DESIGNATED HIM AS MY FUTURE MASTER
M
PELET MR
CRIMSWORTH MR
CRIMSWORTH M
PELET A BOW ON EACH
SIDE FINISHED THE CEREMONY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF A BOW I MADE AN
ORDINARY ONE I SUPPOSE FOR I WAS IN A TRANQUIL COMMONPLACE FRAME OF
MIND I FELT NONE OF THE AGITATION WHICH HAD TROUBLED MY FIRST INTERVIEW
WITH EDWARD CRIMSWORTH
M
PELET'S BOW WAS EXTREMELY POLITE YET NOT
THEATRICAL SCARCELY FRENCH HE AND I WERE PRESENTLY SEATED OPPOSITE TO
EACH OTHER
IN A PLEASING VOICE LOW AND OUT OF CONSIDERATION TO MY
FOREIGN EARS VERY DISTINCT AND DELIBERATE M
PELET INTIMATED THAT HE
HAD JUST BEEN RECEIVING FROM LE RESPECTABLE M
BROWN AN ACCOUNT OF MY
ATTAINMENTS AND CHARACTER WHICH RELIEVED HIM FROM ALL SCRUPLE AS TO
THE PROPRIETY OF ENGAGING ME AS PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH AND LATIN IN
HIS ESTABLISHMENT NEVERTHELESS FOR FORM'S SAKE HE WOULD PUT A FEW
QUESTIONS TO TEST MY POWERS
HE DID AND EXPRESSED IN FLATTERING TERMS
HIS SATISFACTION AT MY ANSWERS
THE SUBJECT OF SALARY NEXT CAME ON IT
WAS FIXED AT ONE THOUSAND FRANCS PER ANNUM BESIDES BOARD AND LODGING
AND IN ADDITION SUGGESTED M
PELET AS THERE WILL BE SOME HOURS
IN EACH DAY DURING WHICH YOUR SERVICES WILL NOT BE REQUIRED IN MY
ESTABLISHMENT YOU MAY IN TIME OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT IN OTHER SEMINARIES
AND THUS TURN YOUR VACANT MOMENTS TO PROFITABLE ACCOUNT
I THOUGHT THIS VERY KIND AND INDEED I FOUND AFTERWARDS THAT THE TERMS
ON WHICH M
PELET HAD ENGAGED ME WERE REALLY LIBERAL FOR BRUSSELS
INSTRUCTION BEING EXTREMELY CHEAP THERE ON ACCOUNT OF THE NUMBER OF
TEACHERS
IT WAS FURTHER ARRANGED THAT I SHOULD BE INSTALLED IN MY NEW
POST THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER WHICH M
PELET AND I PARTED
WELL AND WHAT WAS HE LIKE AND WHAT WERE MY IMPRESSIONS CONCERNING HIM
HE WAS A MAN OF ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE OF MIDDLE SIZE AND RATHER
EMACIATED FIGURE HIS FACE WAS PALE HIS CHEEKS WERE SUNK AND HIS EYES
HOLLOW HIS FEATURES WERE PLEASING AND REGULAR THEY HAD A FRENCH
TURN FOR M
PELET WAS NO FLEMING BUT A FRENCHMAN BOTH BY BIRTH
AND PARENTAGE YET THE DEGREE OF HARSHNESS INSEPARABLE FROM GALLIC
LINEAMENTS WAS IN HIS CASE SOFTENED BY A MILD BLUE EYE AND A
MELANCHOLY ALMOST SUFFERING EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE HIS PHYSIOGNOMY
WAS FINE ET SPIRITUELLE I USE TWO FRENCH WORDS BECAUSE THEY DEFINE
BETTER THAN ANY ENGLISH TERMS THE SPECIES OF INTELLIGENCE WITH WHICH HIS
FEATURES WERE IMBUED
HE WAS ALTOGETHER AN INTERESTING AND PREPOSSESSING
PERSONAGE
I WONDERED ONLY AT THE UTTER ABSENCE OF ALL THE ORDINARY
CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS PROFESSION AND ALMOST FEARED HE COULD NOT BE
STERN AND RESOLUTE ENOUGH FOR A SCHOOLMASTER
EXTERNALLY AT LEAST
M
PELET PRESENTED AN ABSOLUTE CONTRAST TO MY LATE MASTER EDWARD
CRIMSWORTH
INFLUENCED BY THE IMPRESSION I HAD RECEIVED OF HIS GENTLENESS I WAS A
GOOD DEAL SURPRISED WHEN ON ARRIVING THE NEXT DAY AT MY NEW EMPLOYER'S
HOUSE AND BEING ADMITTED TO A FIRST VIEW OF WHAT WAS TO BE THE
SPHERE OF MY FUTURE LABOURS NAMELY THE LARGE LOFTY AND WELL LIGHTED
SCHOOLROOMS I BEHELD A NUMEROUS ASSEMBLAGE OF PUPILS BOYS OF COURSE
WHOSE COLLECTIVE APPEARANCE SHOWED ALL THE SIGNS OF A FULL FLOURISHING
AND WELL DISCIPLINED SEMINARY
AS I TRAVERSED THE CLASSES IN COMPANY
WITH M
PELET A PROFOUND SILENCE REIGNED ON ALL SIDES AND IF BY CHANCE
A MURMUR OR A WHISPER AROSE ONE GLANCE FROM THE PENSIVE EYE OF THIS
MOST GENTLE PEDAGOGUE STILLED IT INSTANTLY
IT WAS ASTONISHING I
THOUGHT HOW SO MILD A CHECK COULD PROVE SO EFFECTUAL
WHEN I HAD
PERAMBULATED THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE CLASSES M
PELET TURNED AND
SAID TO ME
WOULD YOU OBJECT TO TAKING THE BOYS AS THEY ARE AND TESTING THEIR
PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH
THE PROPOSAL WAS UNEXPECTED
I HAD THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED AT
LEAST THREE DAYS TO PREPARE BUT IT IS A BAD OMEN TO COMMENCE ANY CAREER
BY HESITATION SO I JUST STEPPED TO THE PROFESSOR'S DESK NEAR WHICH WE
STOOD AND FACED THE CIRCLE OF MY PUPILS
I TOOK A MOMENT TO COLLECT
MY THOUGHTS AND LIKEWISE TO FRAME IN FRENCH THE SENTENCE BY WHICH I
PROPOSED TO OPEN BUSINESS
I MADE IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE
MESSIEURS PRENEZ VOS LIVRES DE LECTURE
ANGLAIS OU FRANCAIS MONSIEUR DEMANDED A THICKSET MOON FACED YOUNG
FLAMAND IN A BLOUSE
THE ANSWER WAS FORTUNATELY EASY
ANGLAIS
I DETERMINED TO GIVE MYSELF AS LITTLE TROUBLE AS POSSIBLE IN THIS
LESSON IT WOULD NOT DO YET TO TRUST MY UNPRACTISED TONGUE WITH THE
DELIVERY OF EXPLANATIONS MY ACCENT AND IDIOM WOULD BE TOO OPEN TO THE
CRITICISMS OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN BEFORE ME RELATIVE TO WHOM I FELT
ALREADY IT WOULD BE NECESSARY AT ONCE TO TAKE UP AN ADVANTAGEOUS
POSITION AND I PROCEEDED TO EMPLOY MEANS ACCORDINGLY
COMMENCEZ CRIED I WHEN THEY HAD ALL PRODUCED THEIR BOOKS
THE
MOON FACED YOUTH BY NAME JULES VANDERKELKOV AS I AFTERWARDS LEARNT
TOOK THE FIRST SENTENCE
THE LIVRE DE LECTURE WAS THE VICAR OF
WAKEFIELD MUCH USED IN FOREIGN SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSED TO
CONTAIN PRIME SAMPLES OF CONVERSATIONAL ENGLISH IT MIGHT HOWEVER
HAVE BEEN A RUNIC SCROLL FOR ANY RESEMBLANCE THE WORDS AS ENUNCIATED BY
JULES BORE TO THE LANGUAGE IN ORDINARY USE AMONGST THE NATIVES OF GREAT
BRITAIN
MY GOD HOW HE DID SNUFFLE SNORT AND WHEEZE ALL HE SAID WAS
SAID IN HIS THROAT AND NOSE FOR IT IS THUS THE FLAMANDS SPEAK BUT
I HEARD HIM TO THE END OF HIS PARAGRAPH WITHOUT PROFFERING A WORD OF
CORRECTION WHEREAT HE LOOKED VASTLY SELF COMPLACENT CONVINCED
NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD ACQUITTED HIMSELF LIKE A REAL BORN AND BRED
ANGLAIS IN THE SAME UNMOVED SILENCE I LISTENED TO A DOZEN IN
ROTATION AND WHEN THE TWELFTH HAD CONCLUDED WITH SPLUTTER HISS AND
MUMBLE I SOLEMNLY LAID DOWN THE BOOK
ARRETEZ SAID I
THERE WAS A PAUSE DURING WHICH I REGARDED THEM ALL
WITH A STEADY AND SOMEWHAT STERN GAZE A DOG IF STARED AT HARD ENOUGH
AND LONG ENOUGH WILL SHOW SYMPTOMS OF EMBARRASSMENT AND SO AT LENGTH
DID MY BENCH OF BELGIANS
PERCEIVING THAT SOME OF THE FACES BEFORE ME
WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK SULLEN AND OTHERS ASHAMED I SLOWLY JOINED MY
HANDS AND EJACULATED IN A DEEP VOIX DE POITRINE
COMME C'EST AFFREUX
THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER POUTED COLOURED SWUNG THEIR HEELS THEY
WERE NOT PLEASED I SAW BUT THEY WERE IMPRESSED AND IN THE WAY
I WISHED THEM TO BE
HAVING THUS TAKEN THEM DOWN A PEG IN THEIR
SELF CONCEIT THE NEXT STEP WAS TO RAISE MYSELF IN THEIR ESTIMATION NOT
A VERY EASY THING CONSIDERING THAT I HARDLY DARED TO SPEAK FOR FEAR OF
BETRAYING MY OWN DEFICIENCIES
ECOUTEZ MESSIEURS SAID I AND I ENDEAVOURED TO THROW INTO MY
ACCENTS THE COMPASSIONATE TONE OF A SUPERIOR BEING WHO TOUCHED BY THE
EXTREMITY OF THE HELPLESSNESS WHICH AT FIRST ONLY EXCITED HIS SCORN
DEIGNS AT LENGTH TO BESTOW AID
I THEN BEGAN AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF
THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD AND READ IN A SLOW DISTINCT VOICE SOME
TWENTY PAGES THEY ALL THE WHILE SITTING MUTE AND LISTENING WITH FIXED
ATTENTION BY THE TIME I HAD DONE NEARLY AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED
I THEN
ROSE AND SAID
C'EST ASSEZ POUR AUJOURD'HUI MESSIEURS DEMAIN NOUS RECOMMENCERONS ET
J'ESPERE QUE TOUT IRA BIEN
WITH THIS ORACULAR SENTENCE I BOWED AND IN COMPANY WITH M
PELET
QUITTED THE SCHOOL ROOM
C'EST BIEN C'EST TRES BIEN SAID MY PRINCIPAL AS WE ENTERED HIS
PARLOUR
JE VOIS QUE MONSIEUR A DE L'ADRESSE CELA ME PLAIT CAR DANS
L'INSTRUCTION L'ADRESSE FAIT TOUT AUTANT QUE LE SAVOIR
FROM THE PARLOUR M
PELET CONDUCTED ME TO MY APARTMENT MY CHAMBRE
AS MONSIEUR SAID WITH A CERTAIN AIR OF COMPLACENCY
IT WAS A VERY SMALL
ROOM WITH AN EXCESSIVELY SMALL BED BUT M
PELET GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND
THAT I WAS TO OCCUPY IT QUITE ALONE WHICH WAS OF COURSE A GREAT
COMFORT
YET THOUGH SO LIMITED IN DIMENSIONS IT HAD TWO WINDOWS
LIGHT
NOT BEING TAXED IN BELGIUM THE PEOPLE NEVER GRUDGE ITS ADMISSION INTO
THEIR HOUSES JUST HERE HOWEVER THIS OBSERVATION IS NOT VERY APROPOS
FOR ONE OF THESE WINDOWS WAS BOARDED UP THE OPEN WINDOWS LOOKED INTO
THE BOYS' PLAYGROUND
I GLANCED AT THE OTHER AS WONDERING WHAT ASPECT
IT WOULD PRESENT IF DISENCUMBERED OF THE BOARDS
M
PELET READ I
SUPPOSE THE EXPRESSION OF MY EYE HE EXPLAINED
LA FENETRE FERMEE DONNE SUR UN JARDIN APPARTENANT A UN PENSIONNAT
DE DEMOISELLES SAID HE ET LES CONVENANCES EXIGENT ENFIN VOUS
COMPRENEZ N'EST CE PAS MONSIEUR
OUI OUI WAS MY REPLY AND I LOOKED OF COURSE QUITE SATISFIED BUT
WHEN M
PELET HAD RETIRED AND CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HIM THE FIRST THING
I DID WAS TO SCRUTINIZE CLOSELY THE NAILED BOARDS HOPING TO FIND
SOME CHINK OR CREVICE WHICH I MIGHT ENLARGE AND SO GET A PEEP AT THE
CONSECRATED GROUND
MY RESEARCHES WERE VAIN FOR THE BOARDS WERE WELL
JOINED AND STRONGLY NAILED
IT IS ASTONISHING HOW DISAPPOINTED I FELT
I
THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO PLEASANT TO HAVE LOOKED OUT UPON A
GARDEN PLANTED WITH FLOWERS AND TREES SO AMUSING TO HAVE WATCHED THE
DEMOISELLES AT THEIR PLAY TO HAVE STUDIED FEMALE CHARACTER IN A VARIETY
OF PHASES MYSELF THE WHILE SHELTERED FROM VIEW BY A MODEST MUSLIN
CURTAIN WHEREAS OWING DOUBTLESS TO THE ABSURD SCRUPLES OF SOME OLD
DUENNA OF A DIRECTRESS I HAD NOW ONLY THE OPTION OF LOOKING AT A BARE
GRAVELLED COURT WITH AN ENORMOUS PAS DE GEANT IN THE MIDDLE AND THE
MONOTONOUS WALLS AND WINDOWS OF A BOYS' SCHOOL HOUSE ROUND
NOT ONLY
THEN BUT MANY A TIME AFTER ESPECIALLY IN MOMENTS OF WEARINESS AND
LOW SPIRITS DID I LOOK WITH DISSATISFIED EYES ON THAT MOST TANTALIZING
BOARD LONGING TO TEAR IT AWAY AND GET A GLIMPSE OF THE GREEN REGION
WHICH I IMAGINED TO LIE BEYOND
I KNEW A TREE GREW CLOSE UP TO THE
WINDOW FOR THOUGH THERE WERE AS YET NO LEAVES TO RUSTLE I OFTEN HEARD
AT NIGHT THE TAPPING OF BRANCHES AGAINST THE PANES
IN THE DAYTIME
WHEN I LISTENED ATTENTIVELY I COULD HEAR EVEN THROUGH THE BOARDS THE
VOICES OF THE DEMOISELLES IN THEIR HOURS OF RECREATION AND TO SPEAK
THE HONEST TRUTH MY SENTIMENTAL REFLECTIONS WERE OCCASIONALLY A TRIFLE
DISARRANGED BY THE NOT QUITE SILVERY IN FACT THE TOO OFTEN BRAZEN
SOUNDS WHICH RISING FROM THE UNSEEN PARADISE BELOW PENETRATED
CLAMOROUSLY INTO MY SOLITUDE
NOT TO MINCE MATTERS IT REALLY SEEMED TO
ME A DOUBTFUL CASE WHETHER THE LUNGS OF MDLLE
REUTER'S GIRLS OR THOSE
OF M
PELET'S BOYS WERE THE STRONGEST AND WHEN IT CAME TO SHRIEKING
THE GIRLS INDISPUTABLY BEAT THE BOYS HOLLOW
I FORGOT TO SAY BY THE BY
THAT REUTER WAS THE NAME OF THE OLD LADY WHO HAD HAD MY WINDOW BEARDED
UP
I SAY OLD FOR SUCH I OF COURSE CONCLUDED HER TO BE JUDGING FROM
HER CAUTIOUS CHAPERON LIKE PROCEEDINGS BESIDES NOBODY EVER SPOKE OF
HER AS YOUNG
I REMEMBER I WAS VERY MUCH AMUSED WHEN I FIRST HEARD HER
CHRISTIAN NAME IT WAS ZORAIDE MADEMOISELLE ZORAIDE REUTER
BUT THE
CONTINENTAL NATIONS DO ALLOW THEMSELVES VAGARIES IN THE CHOICE OF NAMES
SUCH AS WE SOBER ENGLISH NEVER RUN INTO
I THINK INDEED WE HAVE TOO
LIMITED A LIST TO CHOOSE FROM
MEANTIME MY PATH WAS GRADUALLY GROWING SMOOTH BEFORE ME
I IN A
FEW WEEKS CONQUERED THE TEASING DIFFICULTIES INSEPARABLE FROM THE
COMMENCEMENT OF ALMOST EVERY CAREER
ERE LONG I HAD ACQUIRED AS MUCH
FACILITY IN SPEAKING FRENCH AS SET ME AT MY EASE WITH MY PUPILS AND
AS I HAD ENCOUNTERED THEM ON A RIGHT FOOTING AT THE VERY BEGINNING AND
CONTINUED TENACIOUSLY TO RETAIN THE ADVANTAGE I HAD EARLY GAINED THEY
NEVER ATTEMPTED MUTINY WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE ALL WHO ARE IN ANY DEGREE
ACQUAINTED WITH THE ONGOINGS OF BELGIAN SCHOOLS AND WHO KNOW THE
RELATION IN WHICH PROFESSORS AND PUPILS TOO FREQUENTLY STAND TOWARDS
EACH OTHER IN THOSE ESTABLISHMENTS WILL CONSIDER AN IMPORTANT AND
UNCOMMON ONE
BEFORE CONCLUDING THIS CHAPTER I WILL SAY A WORD ON THE
SYSTEM I PURSUED WITH REGARD TO MY CLASSES MY EXPERIENCE MAY POSSIBLY
BE OF USE TO OTHERS
IT DID NOT REQUIRE VERY KEEN OBSERVATION TO DETECT THE CHARACTER OF THE
YOUTH OF BRABANT BUT IT NEEDED A CERTAIN DEGREE OF TACT TO ADOPT ONE'S
MEASURES TO THEIR CAPACITY
THEIR INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES WERE GENERALLY
WEAK THEIR ANIMAL PROPENSITIES STRONG THUS THERE WAS AT ONCE AN
IMPOTENCE AND A KIND OF INERT FORCE IN THEIR NATURES THEY WERE DULL
BUT THEY WERE ALSO SINGULARLY STUBBORN HEAVY AS LEAD AND LIKE LEAD
MOST DIFFICULT TO MOVE
SUCH BEING THE CASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TRULY
ABSURD TO EXACT FROM THEM MUCH IN THE WAY OF MENTAL EXERTION HAVING
SHORT MEMORIES DENSE INTELLIGENCE FEEBLE REFLECTIVE POWERS THEY
RECOILED WITH REPUGNANCE FROM ANY OCCUPATION THAT DEMANDED CLOSE STUDY
OR DEEP THOUGHT
HAD THE ABHORRED EFFORT BEEN EXTORTED FROM THEM BY
INJUDICIOUS AND ARBITRARY MEASURES ON THE PART OF THE PROFESSOR THEY
WOULD HAVE RESISTED AS OBSTINATELY AS CLAMOROUSLY AS DESPERATE SWINE
AND THOUGH NOT BRAVE SINGLY THEY WERE RELENTLESS ACTING EN MASSE
I UNDERSTOOD THAT BEFORE MY ARRIVAL IN M
PELET'S ESTABLISHMENT THE
COMBINED INSUBORDINATION OF THE PUPILS HAD EFFECTED THE DISMISSAL OF
MORE THAN ONE ENGLISH MASTER
IT WAS NECESSARY THEN TO EXACT ONLY THE
MOST MODERATE APPLICATION FROM NATURES SO LITTLE QUALIFIED TO APPLY TO
ASSIST IN EVERY PRACTICABLE WAY UNDERSTANDINGS SO OPAQUE AND
CONTRACTED TO BE EVER GENTLE CONSIDERATE YIELDING EVEN TO A CERTAIN
POINT WITH DISPOSITIONS SO IRRATIONALLY PERVERSE BUT HAVING REACHED
THAT CULMINATING POINT OF INDULGENCE YOU MUST FIX YOUR FOOT PLANT IT
ROOT IT IN ROCK BECOME IMMUTABLE AS THE TOWERS OF STE
GUDULE FOR A
STEP BUT HALF A STEP FARTHER AND YOU WOULD PLUNGE HEADLONG INTO THE
GULF OF IMBECILITY THERE LODGED YOU WOULD SPEEDILY RECEIVE PROOFS
OF FLEMISH GRATITUDE AND MAGNANIMITY IN SHOWERS OF BRABANT SALIVA AND
HANDFULS OF LOW COUNTRY MUD
YOU MIGHT SMOOTH TO THE UTMOST THE PATH OF
LEARNING REMOVE EVERY PEBBLE FROM THE TRACK BUT THEN YOU MUST FINALLY
INSIST WITH DECISION ON THE PUPIL TAKING YOUR ARM AND ALLOWING HIMSELF
TO BE LED QUIETLY ALONG THE PREPARED ROAD
WHEN I HAD BROUGHT DOWN MY
LESSON TO THE LOWEST LEVEL OF MY DULLEST PUPIL'S CAPACITY WHEN I
HAD SHOWN MYSELF THE MILDEST THE MOST TOLERANT OF MASTERS A WORD OF
IMPERTINENCE A MOVEMENT OF DISOBEDIENCE CHANGED ME AT ONCE INTO
A DESPOT
I OFFERED THEN BUT ONE ALTERNATIVE SUBMISSION AND
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ERROR OR IGNOMINIOUS EXPULSION
THIS SYSTEM ANSWERED
AND MY INFLUENCE BY DEGREES BECAME ESTABLISHED ON A FIRM BASIS
THE
BOY IS FATHER TO THE MAN IT IS SAID AND SO I OFTEN THOUGHT WHEN
LOOKED AT MY BOYS AND REMEMBERED THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF THEIR
ANCESTORS
PELET'S SCHOOL WAS MERELY AN EPITOME OF THE BELGIAN NATION
CHAPTER VIII
AND PELET HIMSELF HOW DID I CONTINUE TO LIKE HIM OH EXTREMELY WELL
NOTHING COULD BE MORE SMOOTH GENTLEMANLIKE AND EVEN FRIENDLY THAN
HIS DEMEANOUR TO ME
I HAD TO ENDURE FROM HIM NEITHER COLD NEGLECT
IRRITATING INTERFERENCE NOR PRETENTIOUS ASSUMPTION OF SUPERIORITY
I
FEAR HOWEVER TWO POOR HARD WORKED BELGIAN USHERS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT
COULD NOT HAVE SAID AS MUCH TO THEM THE DIRECTOR'S MANNER WAS
INVARIABLY DRY STERN AND COOL
I BELIEVE HE PERCEIVED ONCE OR TWICE
THAT I WAS A LITTLE SHOCKED AT THE DIFFERENCE HE MADE BETWEEN THEM AND
ME AND ACCOUNTED FOR IT BY SAYING WITH A QUIET SARCASTIC SMILE
CE NE SONT QUE DES FLAMANDS ALLEZ
AND THEN HE TOOK HIS CIGAR GENTLY FROM HIS LIPS AND SPAT ON THE PAINTED
FLOOR OF THE ROOM IN WHICH WE WERE SITTING
FLAMANDS CERTAINLY THEY
WERE AND BOTH HAD THE TRUE FLAMAND PHYSIOGNOMY WHERE INTELLECTUAL
INFERIORITY IS MARKED IN LINES NONE CAN MISTAKE STILL THEY WERE MEN
AND IN THE MAIN HONEST MEN AND I COULD NOT SEE WHY THEIR BEING
ABORIGINALS OF THE FLAT DULL SOIL SHOULD SERVE AS A PRETEXT FOR
TREATING THEM WITH PERPETUAL SEVERITY AND CONTEMPT
THIS IDEA OF
INJUSTICE SOMEWHAT POISONED THE PLEASURE I MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE DERIVED
FROM PELET'S SOFT AFFABLE MANNER TO MYSELF
CERTAINLY IT WAS AGREEABLE
WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS OVER TO FIND ONE'S EMPLOYER AN INTELLIGENT
AND CHEERFUL COMPANION AND IF HE WAS SOMETIMES A LITTLE SARCASTIC
AND SOMETIMES A LITTLE TOO INSINUATING AND IF I DID DISCOVER THAT
HIS MILDNESS WAS MORE A MATTER OF APPEARANCE THAN OF REALITY IF I DID
OCCASIONALLY SUSPECT THE EXISTENCE OF FLINT OR STEEL UNDER AN EXTERNAL
COVERING OF VELVET STILL WE ARE NONE OF US PERFECT AND WEARY AS I WAS
OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF BRUTALITY AND INSOLENCE IN WHICH I HAD CONSTANTLY
LIVED AT X I HAD NO INCLINATION NOW ON CASTING ANCHOR IN CALMER
REGIONS TO INSTITUTE AT ONCE A PRYING SEARCH AFTER DEFECTS THAT WERE
SCRUPULOUSLY WITHDRAWN AND CAREFULLY VEILED FROM MY VIEW
I WAS WILLING
TO TAKE PELET FOR WHAT HE SEEMED TO BELIEVE HIM BENEVOLENT AND FRIENDLY
UNTIL SOME UNTOWARD EVENT SHOULD PROVE HIM OTHERWISE
HE WAS NOT
MARRIED AND I SOON PERCEIVED HE HAD ALL A FRENCHMAN'S ALL A PARISIAN'S
NOTIONS ABOUT MATRIMONY AND WOMEN
I SUSPECTED A DEGREE OF LAXITY IN
HIS CODE OF MORALS THERE WAS SOMETHING SO COLD AND BLASE IN HIS TONE
WHENEVER HE ALLUDED TO WHAT HE CALLED LE BEAU SEXE BUT HE WAS TOO
GENTLEMANLIKE TO INTRUDE TOPICS I DID NOT INVITE AND AS HE WAS REALLY
INTELLIGENT AND REALLY FOND OF INTELLECTUAL SUBJECTS OF DISCOURSE HE
AND I ALWAYS FOUND ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT WITHOUT SEEKING THEMES IN THE
MIRE
I HATED HIS FASHION OF MENTIONING LOVE I ABHORRED FROM MY SOUL
MERE LICENTIOUSNESS
HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE OF OUR NOTIONS AND BY
MUTUAL CONSENT WE KEPT OFF GROUND DEBATEABLE
PELET'S HOUSE WAS KEPT AND HIS KITCHEN MANAGED BY HIS MOTHER A REAL
OLD FRENCHWOMAN SHE HAD BEEN HANDSOME AT LEAST SHE TOLD ME SO AND I
STROVE TO BELIEVE HER SHE WAS NOW UGLY AS ONLY CONTINENTAL OLD WOMEN
CAN BE PERHAPS THOUGH HER STYLE OF DRESS MADE HER LOOK UGLIER THAN
SHE REALLY WAS
INDOORS SHE WOULD GO ABOUT WITHOUT CAP HER GREY HAIR
STRANGELY DISHEVELLED THEN WHEN AT HOME SHE SELDOM WORE A GOWN ONLY
A SHABBY COTTON CAMISOLE SHOES TOO WERE STRANGERS TO HER FEET AND IN
LIEU OF THEM SHE SPORTED ROOMY SLIPPERS TRODDEN DOWN AT THE HEELS
ON
THE OTHER HAND WHENEVER IT WAS HER PLEASURE TO APPEAR ABROAD AS ON
SUNDAYS AND FETE DAYS SHE WOULD PUT ON SOME VERY BRILLIANT COLOURED
DRESS USUALLY OF THIN TEXTURE A SILK BONNET WITH A WREATH OF FLOWERS
AND A VERY FINE SHAWL
SHE WAS NOT IN THE MAIN AN ILL NATURED OLD
WOMAN BUT AN INCESSANT AND MOST INDISCREET TALKER SHE KEPT CHIEFLY
IN AND ABOUT THE KITCHEN AND SEEMED RATHER TO AVOID HER SON'S AUGUST
PRESENCE OF HIM INDEED SHE EVIDENTLY STOOD IN AWE
WHEN HE REPROVED
HER HIS REPROOFS WERE BITTER AND UNSPARING BUT HE SELDOM GAVE HIMSELF
THAT TROUBLE
MADAME PELET HAD HER OWN SOCIETY HER OWN CIRCLE OF CHOSEN VISITORS
WHOM HOWEVER I SELDOM SAW AS SHE GENERALLY ENTERTAINED THEM IN WHAT
SHE CALLED HER CABINET A SMALL DEN OF A PLACE ADJOINING THE KITCHEN
AND DESCENDING INTO IT BY ONE OR TWO STEPS
ON THESE STEPS BY THE BY
I HAVE NOT UNFREQUENTLY SEEN MADAME PELET SEATED WITH A TRENCHER ON
HER KNEE ENGAGED IN THE THREEFOLD EMPLOYMENT OF EATING HER DINNER
GOSSIPING WITH HER FAVOURITE SERVANT THE HOUSEMAID AND SCOLDING HER
ANTAGONIST THE COOK SHE NEVER DINED AND SELDOM INDEED TOOK ANY MEAL
WITH HER SON AND AS TO SHOWING HER FACE AT THE BOYS' TABLE THAT WAS
QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION
THESE DETAILS WILL SOUND VERY ODD IN ENGLISH
EARS BUT BELGIUM IS NOT ENGLAND AND ITS WAYS ARE NOT OUR WAYS
MADAME PELET'S HABITS OF LIFE THEN BEING TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
I WAS A GOOD DEAL SURPRISED WHEN ONE THURSDAY EVENING THURSDAY WAS
ALWAYS A HALF HOLIDAY AS I WAS SITTING ALL ALONE IN MY APARTMENT
CORRECTING A HUGE PILE OF ENGLISH AND LATIN EXERCISES A SERVANT
TAPPED AT THE DOOR AND ON ITS BEING OPENED PRESENTED MADAME PELET'S
COMPLIMENTS AND SHE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE ME TO TAKE MY GOUTER A
MEAL WHICH ANSWERS TO OUR ENGLISH TEA WITH HER IN THE DINING ROOM
PLAIT IL SAID I FOR I THOUGHT I MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD THE
MESSAGE AND INVITATION WERE SO UNUSUAL THE SAME WORDS WERE REPEATED
I
ACCEPTED OF COURSE AND AS I DESCENDED THE STAIRS I WONDERED WHAT
WHIM HAD ENTERED THE OLD LADY'S BRAIN HER SON WAS OUT GONE TO PASS THE
EVENING AT THE SALLE OF THE GRANDE HARMONIE OR SOME OTHER CLUB OF WHICH
HE WAS A MEMBER
JUST AS I LAID MY HAND ON THE HANDLE OF THE DINING ROOM
DOOR A QUEER IDEA GLANCED ACROSS MY MIND
SURELY SHE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE LOVE TO ME SAID I
I'VE HEARD OF
OLD FRENCHWOMEN DOING ODD THINGS IN THAT LINE AND THE GOUTER THEY
GENERALLY BEGIN SUCH AFFAIRS WITH EATING AND DRINKING I BELIEVE
THERE WAS A FEARFUL DISMAY IN THIS SUGGESTION OF MY EXCITED IMAGINATION
AND IF I HAD ALLOWED MYSELF TIME TO DWELL UPON IT I SHOULD NO DOUBT
HAVE CUT THERE AND THEN RUSHED BACK TO MY CHAMBER AND BOLTED MYSELF
IN BUT WHENEVER A DANGER OR A HORROR IS VEILED WITH UNCERTAINTY
THE PRIMARY WISH OF THE MIND IS TO ASCERTAIN FIRST THE NAKED TRUTH
RESERVING THE EXPEDIENT OF FLIGHT FOR THE MOMENT WHEN ITS DREAD
ANTICIPATION SHALL BE REALIZED
I TURNED THE DOOR HANDLE AND IN AN
INSTANT HAD CROSSED THE FATAL THRESHOLD CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME AND
STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF MADAME PELET
GRACIOUS HEAVENS THE FIRST VIEW OF HER SEEMED TO CONFIRM MY WORST
APPREHENSIONS
THERE SHE SAT DRESSED OUT IN A LIGHT GREEN MUSLIN GOWN
ON HER HEAD A LACE CAP WITH FLOURISHING RED ROSES IN THE FRILL HER
TABLE WAS CAREFULLY SPREAD THERE WERE FRUIT CAKES AND COFFEE WITH A
BOTTLE OF SOMETHING I DID NOT KNOW WHAT
ALREADY THE COLD SWEAT STARTED
ON MY BROW ALREADY I GLANCED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER AT THE CLOSED
DOOR WHEN TO MY UNSPEAKABLE RELIEF MY EYE WANDERING MILDLY IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE STOVE RESTED UPON A SECOND FIGURE SEATED IN A LARGE
FAUTEUIL BESIDE IT
THIS WAS A WOMAN TOO AND MOREOVER AN OLD WOMAN
AND AS FAT AND AS RUBICUND AS MADAME PELET WAS MEAGRE AND YELLOW HER
ATTIRE WAS LIKEWISE VERY FINE AND SPRING FLOWERS OF DIFFERENT HUES
CIRCLED IN A BRIGHT WREATH THE CROWN OF HER VIOLET COLOURED VELVET
BONNET
I HAD ONLY TIME TO MAKE THESE GENERAL OBSERVATIONS WHEN MADAME PELET
COMING FORWARD WITH WHAT SHE INTENDED SHOULD BE A GRACEFUL AND ELASTIC
STEP THUS ACCOSTED ME
MONSIEUR IS INDEED MOST OBLIGING TO QUIT HIS BOOKS HIS STUDIES AT THE
REQUEST OF AN INSIGNIFICANT PERSON LIKE ME WILL MONSIEUR COMPLETE HIS
KINDNESS BY ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT HIM TO MY DEAR FRIEND MADAME REUTER
WHO RESIDES IN THE NEIGHBOURING HOUSE THE YOUNG LADIES' SCHOOL
AH THOUGHT I I KNEW SHE WAS OLD AND I BOWED AND TOOK MY SEAT
MADAME REUTER PLACED HERSELF AT THE TABLE OPPOSITE TO ME
HOW DO YOU LIKE BELGIUM MONSIEUR ASKED SHE IN AN ACCENT OF THE
BROADEST BRUXELLOIS
I COULD NOW WELL DISTINGUISH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THE FINE AND PURE PARISIAN UTTERANCE OF M
PELET FOR INSTANCE AND
THE GUTTURAL ENUNCIATION OF THE FLAMANDS
I ANSWERED POLITELY AND THEN
WONDERED HOW SO COARSE AND CLUMSY AN OLD WOMAN AS THE ONE BEFORE ME
SHOULD BE AT THE HEAD OF A LADIES' SEMINARY WHICH I HAD ALWAYS HEARD
SPOKEN OF IN TERMS OF HIGH COMMENDATION
IN TRUTH THERE WAS SOMETHING
TO WONDER AT
MADAME REUTER LOOKED MORE LIKE A JOYOUS FREE LIVING OLD
FLEMISH FERMIERE OR EVEN A MAITRESSE D'AUBERGE THAN A STAID GRAVE
RIGID DIRECTRICE DE PENSIONNAT
IN GENERAL THE CONTINENTAL OR AT LEAST
THE BELGIAN OLD WOMEN PERMIT THEMSELVES A LICENCE OF MANNERS SPEECH
AND ASPECT SUCH AS OUR VENERABLE GRANDDAMES WOULD RECOIL FROM AS
ABSOLUTELY DISREPUTABLE AND MADAME REUTER'S JOLLY FACE BORE EVIDENCE
THAT SHE WAS NO EXCEPTION TO THE RULE OF HER COUNTRY THERE WAS A
TWINKLE AND LEER IN HER LEFT EYE HER RIGHT SHE KEPT HABITUALLY HALF
SHUT WHICH I THOUGHT VERY ODD INDEED
AFTER SEVERAL VAIN ATTEMPTS TO
COMPREHEND THE MOTIVES OF THESE TWO DROLL OLD CREATURES FOR INVITING ME
TO JOIN THEM AT THEIR GOUTER I AT LAST FAIRLY GAVE IT UP AND RESIGNING
MYSELF TO INEVITABLE MYSTIFICATION I SAT AND LOOKED FIRST AT ONE THEN
AT THE OTHER TAKING CARE MEANTIME TO DO JUSTICE TO THE CONFITURES
CAKES AND COFFEE WITH WHICH THEY AMPLY SUPPLIED ME
THEY TOO ATE
AND THAT WITH NO DELICATE APPETITE AND HAVING DEMOLISHED A LARGE
PORTION OF THE SOLIDS THEY PROPOSED A PETIT VERRE I DECLINED
NOT
SO MESDAMES PELET AND REUTER EACH MIXED HERSELF WHAT I THOUGHT RATHER
A STIFF TUMBLER OF PUNCH AND PLACING IT ON A STAND NEAR THE STOVE THEY
DREW UP THEIR CHAIRS TO THAT CONVENIENCE AND INVITED ME TO DO THE SAME
I OBEYED AND BEING SEATED FAIRLY BETWEEN THEM I WAS THUS ADDRESSED
FIRST BY MADAME PELET THEN BY MADAME REUTER
WE WILL NOW SPEAK OF BUSINESS SAID MADAME PELET AND SHE WENT ON TO
MAKE AN ELABORATE SPEECH WHICH BEING INTERPRETED WAS TO THE EFFECT
THAT SHE HAD ASKED FOR THE PLEASURE OF MY COMPANY THAT EVENING IN
ORDER TO GIVE HER FRIEND MADAME REUTER AN OPPORTUNITY OF BROACHING AN
IMPORTANT PROPOSAL WHICH MIGHT TURN OUT GREATLY TO MY ADVANTAGE
POURVU QUE VOUS SOYEZ SAGE SAID MADAME REUTER ET A VRAI DIRE
VOUS EN AVEZ BIEN L'AIR
TAKE ONE DROP OF THE PUNCH OR PONCHE AS SHE
PRONOUNCED IT IT IS AN AGREEABLE AND WHOLESOME BEVERAGE AFTER A FULL
MEAL
I BOWED BUT AGAIN DECLINED IT
SHE WENT ON
I FEEL SAID SHE AFTER A SOLEMN SIP I FEEL PROFOUNDLY THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH MY DEAR DAUGHTER HAS ENTRUSTED
ME FOR YOU ARE AWARE MONSIEUR THAT IT IS MY DAUGHTER WHO DIRECTS THE
ESTABLISHMENT IN THE NEXT HOUSE
AH I THOUGHT IT WAS YOURSELF MADAME THOUGH INDEED AT THAT MOMENT
I RECOLLECTED THAT IT WAS CALLED MADEMOISELLE NOT MADAME REUTER'S
PENSIONNAT
I OH NO I MANAGE THE HOUSE AND LOOK AFTER THE SERVANTS AS MY FRIEND
MADAME PELET DOES FOR MONSIEUR HER SON NOTHING MORE
AH YOU THOUGHT I
GAVE LESSONS IN CLASS DID YOU
AND SHE LAUGHED LOUD AND LONG AS THOUGH THE IDEA TICKLED HER FANCY
AMAZINGLY
MADAME IS IN THE WRONG TO LAUGH I OBSERVED IF SHE DOES NOT GIVE
LESSONS I AM SURE IT IS NOT BECAUSE SHE CANNOT AND I WHIPPED OUT A
WHITE POCKET HANDKERCHIEF AND WAFTED IT WITH A FRENCH GRACE PAST MY
NOSE BOWING AT THE SAME TIME
QUEL CHARMANT JEUNE HOMME MURMURED MADAME PELET IN A LOW VOICE
MADAME REUTER BEING LESS SENTIMENTAL AS SHE WAS FLAMAND AND NOT
FRENCH ONLY LAUGHED AGAIN
YOU ARE A DANGEROUS PERSON I FEAR SAID SHE IF YOU CAN FORGE
COMPLIMENTS AT THAT RATE ZORAIDE WILL POSITIVELY BE AFRAID OF YOU BUT
IF YOU ARE GOOD I WILL KEEP YOUR SECRET AND NOT TELL HER HOW WELL YOU
CAN FLATTER
NOW LISTEN WHAT SORT OF A PROPOSAL SHE MAKES TO YOU
SHE
HAS HEARD THAT YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT PROFESSOR AND AS SHE WISHES TO GET
THE VERY BEST MASTERS FOR HER SCHOOL CAR ZORAIDE FAIT TOUT COMME UNE
REINE C'EST UNE VERITABLE MAITRESSE FEMME SHE HAS COMMISSIONED ME TO
STEP OVER THIS AFTERNOON AND SOUND MADAME PELET AS TO THE POSSIBILITY
OF ENGAGING YOU
ZORAIDE IS A WARY GENERAL SHE NEVER ADVANCES WITHOUT
FIRST EXAMINING WELL HER GROUND
I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD BE PLEASED
IF SHE KNEW I HAD ALREADY DISCLOSED HER INTENTIONS TO YOU SHE DID NOT
ORDER ME TO GO SO FAR BUT I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE NO HARM IN LETTING
YOU INTO THE SECRET AND MADAME PELET WAS OF THE SAME OPINION
TAKE
CARE HOWEVER YOU DON'T BETRAY EITHER OF US TO ZORAIDE TO MY
DAUGHTER I MEAN SHE IS SO DISCREET AND CIRCUMSPECT HERSELF SHE CANNOT
UNDERSTAND THAT ONE SHOULD FIND A PLEASURE IN GOSSIPING A LITTLE
C'EST ABSOLUMENT COMME MON FILS CRIED MADAME PELET
ALL THE WORLD IS SO CHANGED SINCE OUR GIRLHOOD REJOINED THE OTHER
YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE SUCH OLD HEADS NOW
BUT TO RETURN MONSIEUR
MADAME
PELET WILL MENTION THE SUBJECT OF YOUR GIVING LESSONS IN MY DAUGHTER'S
ESTABLISHMENT TO HER SON AND HE WILL SPEAK TO YOU AND THEN TO MORROW
YOU WILL STEP OVER TO OUR HOUSE AND ASK TO SEE MY DAUGHTER AND YOU
WILL INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT AS IF THE FIRST INTIMATION OF IT HAD REACHED
YOU FROM M
PELET HIMSELF AND BE SURE YOU NEVER MENTION MY NAME FOR I
WOULD NOT DISPLEASE ZORAIDE ON ANY ACCOUNT
BIEN BIEN INTERRUPTED I FOR ALL THIS CHATTER AND CIRCUMLOCUTION
BEGAN TO BORE ME VERY MUCH I WILL CONSULT M
PELET AND THE THING
SHALL BE SETTLED AS YOU DESIRE
GOOD EVENING MESDAMES I AM INFINITELY
OBLIGED TO YOU
COMMENT VOUS VOUS EN ALLEZ DEJA EXCLAIMED MADAME PELET
PRENEZ ENCORE QUELQUECHOSE MONSIEUR UNE POMME CUITE DES BISCUITS
ENCORE UNE TASSE DE CAFE
MERCI MERCI MADAME AU REVOIR AND I BACKED AT LAST OUT OF THE
APARTMENT
HAVING REGAINED MY OWN ROOM I SET MYSELF TO TURN OVER IN MY MIND
THE INCIDENT OF THE EVENING
IT SEEMED A QUEER AFFAIR ALTOGETHER AND
QUEERLY MANAGED THE TWO OLD WOMEN HAD MADE QUITE A LITTLE INTRICATE
MESS OF IT STILL I FOUND THAT THE UPPERMOST FEELING IN MY MIND ON THE
SUBJECT WAS ONE OF SATISFACTION
IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WOULD BE A CHANGE
TO GIVE LESSONS IN ANOTHER SEMINARY AND THEN TO TEACH YOUNG LADIES
WOULD BE AN OCCUPATION SO INTERESTING TO BE ADMITTED AT ALL INTO A
LADIES' BOARDING SCHOOL WOULD BE AN INCIDENT SO NEW IN MY LIFE
BESIDES
THOUGHT I AS I GLANCED AT THE BOARDED WINDOW I SHALL NOW AT LAST SEE
THE MYSTERIOUS GARDEN I SHALL GAZE BOTH ON THE ANGELS AND THEIR EDEN
CHAPTER IX
M
PELET COULD NOT OF COURSE OBJECT TO THE PROPOSAL MADE BY MDLLE
REUTER PERMISSION TO ACCEPT SUCH ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT SHOULD IT
OFFER HAVING FORMED AN ARTICLE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH HE HAD ENGAGED ME
IT WAS THEREFORE ARRANGED IN THE COURSE OF NEXT DAY THAT I SHOULD
BE AT LIBERTY TO GIVE LESSONS IN MDLLE
REUTER'S ESTABLISHMENT FOUR
AFTERNOONS IN EVERY WEEK
WHEN EVENING CAME I PREPARED TO STEP OVER IN ORDER TO SEEK A CONFERENCE
WITH MADEMOISELLE HERSELF ON THE SUBJECT I HAD NOT HAD TIME TO PAY THE
VISIT BEFORE HAVING BEEN ALL DAY CLOSELY OCCUPIED IN CLASS
I REMEMBER
VERY WELL THAT BEFORE QUITTING MY CHAMBER I HELD A BRIEF DEBATE WITH
MYSELF AS TO WHETHER I SHOULD CHANGE MY ORDINARY ATTIRE FOR SOMETHING
SMARTER
AT LAST I CONCLUDED IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF LABOUR
DOUBTLESS
THOUGHT I SHE IS SOME STIFF OLD MAID FOR THOUGH THE DAUGHTER OF
MADAME REUTER SHE MAY WELL NUMBER UPWARDS OF FORTY WINTERS BESIDES IF
IT WERE OTHERWISE IF SHE BE BOTH YOUNG AND PRETTY I AM NOT HANDSOME
AND NO DRESSING CAN MAKE ME SO THEREFORE I'LL GO AS I AM AND OFF
I STARTED CURSORILY GLANCING SIDEWAYS AS I PASSED THE TOILET TABLE
SURMOUNTED BY A LOOKING GLASS A THIN IRREGULAR FACE I SAW WITH SUNK
DARK EYES UNDER A LARGE SQUARE FOREHEAD COMPLEXION DESTITUTE OF BLOOM
OR ATTRACTION SOMETHING YOUNG BUT NOT YOUTHFUL NO OBJECT TO WIN A
LADY'S LOVE NO BUTT FOR THE SHAFTS OF CUPID
I WAS SOON AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE PENSIONNAT IN A MOMENT I HAD PULLED
THE BELL IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND WITHIN APPEARED A
PASSAGE PAVED ALTERNATELY WITH BLACK AND WHITE MARBLE THE WALLS WERE
PAINTED IN IMITATION OF MARBLE ALSO AND AT THE FAR END OPENED A GLASS
DOOR THROUGH WHICH I SAW SHRUBS AND A GRASS PLAT LOOKING PLEASANT IN
THE SUNSHINE OF THE MILD SPRING EVENING FOR IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF
APRIL
THIS THEN WAS MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN BUT I HAD NOT TIME TO
LOOK LONG THE PORTRESS AFTER HAVING ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
MY QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HER MISTRESS WAS AT HOME OPENED THE
FOLDING DOORS OF A ROOM TO THE LEFT AND HAVING USHERED ME IN CLOSED
THEM BEHIND ME
I FOUND MYSELF IN A SALON WITH A VERY WELL PAINTED
HIGHLY VARNISHED FLOOR CHAIRS AND SOFAS COVERED WITH WHITE DRAPERIES
A GREEN PORCELAIN STOVE WALLS HUNG WITH PICTURES IN GILT FRAMES A GILT
PENDULE AND OTHER ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE A LARGE LUSTRE PENDENT
FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CEILING MIRRORS CONSOLES MUSLIN CURTAINS AND
A HANDSOME CENTRE TABLE COMPLETED THE INVENTORY OF FURNITURE
ALL LOOKED
EXTREMELY CLEAN AND GLITTERING BUT THE GENERAL EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN
SOMEWHAT CHILLING HAD NOT A SECOND LARGE PAIR OF FOLDING DOORS STANDING
WIDE OPEN AND DISCLOSING ANOTHER AND SMALLER SALON MORE SNUGLY
FURNISHED OFFERED SOME RELIEF TO THE EYE
THIS ROOM WAS CARPETED AND
THEREIN WAS A PIANO A COUCH A CHIFFONNIERE ABOVE ALL IT CONTAINED
A LOFTY WINDOW WITH A CRIMSON CURTAIN WHICH BEING UNDRAWN AFFORDED
ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN THROUGH THE LARGE CLEAR PANES ROUND
WHICH SOME LEAVES OF IVY SOME TENDRILS OF VINE WERE TRAINED
MONSIEUR CREEMSVORT N'EST CE PAS SAID A VOICE BEHIND ME AND
STARTING INVOLUNTARILY I TURNED
I HAD BEEN SO TAKEN UP WITH THE
CONTEMPLATION OF THE PRETTY LITTLE SALON THAT I HAD NOT NOTICED THE
ENTRANCE OF A PERSON INTO THE LARGER ROOM
IT WAS HOWEVER MDLLE
REUTER WHO NOW ADDRESSED ME AND STOOD CLOSE BESIDE ME AND WHEN I HAD
BOWED WITH INSTANTANEOUSLY RECOVERED SANG FROID FOR I AM NOT EASILY
EMBARRASSED I COMMENCED THE CONVERSATION BY REMARKING ON THE PLEASANT
ASPECT OF HER LITTLE CABINET AND THE ADVANTAGE SHE HAD OVER M
PELET IN
POSSESSING A GARDEN
YES SHE SAID SHE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AND ADDED IT IS MY GARDEN
MONSIEUR WHICH MAKES ME RETAIN THIS HOUSE OTHERWISE I SHOULD PROBABLY
HAVE REMOVED TO LARGER AND MORE COMMODIOUS PREMISES LONG SINCE BUT YOU
SEE I COULD NOT TAKE MY GARDEN WITH ME AND I SHOULD SCARCELY FIND ONE
SO LARGE AND PLEASANT ANYWHERE ELSE IN TOWN
I APPROVED HER JUDGMENT
BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET SAID SHE RISING COME TO THE WINDOW
AND TAKE A BETTER VIEW I FOLLOWED HER SHE OPENED THE SASH AND
LEANING OUT I SAW IN FULL THE ENCLOSED DEMESNE WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN
TO ME AN UNKNOWN REGION
IT WAS A LONG NOT VERY BROAD STRIP OF CULTURED
GROUND WITH AN ALLEY BORDERED BY ENORMOUS OLD FRUIT TREES DOWN THE
MIDDLE THERE WAS A SORT OF LAWN A PARTERRE OF ROSE TREES SOME
FLOWER BORDERS AND ON THE FAR SIDE A THICKLY PLANTED COPSE OF LILACS
LABURNUMS AND ACACIAS
IT LOOKED PLEASANT TO ME VERY PLEASANT SO
LONG A TIME HAD ELAPSED SINCE I HAD SEEN A GARDEN OF ANY SORT
BUT IT
WAS NOT ONLY ON MDLLE
REUTER'S GARDEN THAT MY EYES DWELT WHEN I HAD
TAKEN A VIEW OF HER WELL TRIMMED BEDS AND BUDDING SHRUBBERIES I ALLOWED
MY GLANCE TO COME BACK TO HERSELF NOR DID I HASTILY WITHDRAW IT
I HAD THOUGHT TO SEE A TALL MEAGRE YELLOW CONVENTUAL IMAGE IN BLACK
WITH A CLOSE WHITE CAP BANDAGED UNDER THE CHIN LIKE A NUN'S HEAD GEAR
WHEREAS THERE STOOD BY ME A LITTLE AND ROUNDLY FORMED WOMAN WHO MIGHT
INDEED BE OLDER THAN I BUT WAS STILL YOUNG SHE COULD NOT I THOUGHT
BE MORE THAN SIX OR SEVEN AND TWENTY SHE WAS AS FAIR AS A FAIR
ENGLISHWOMAN SHE HAD NO CAP HER HAIR WAS NUT BROWN AND SHE WORE IT
IN CURLS PRETTY HER FEATURES WERE NOT NOR VERY SOFT NOR VERY REGULAR
BUT NEITHER WERE THEY IN ANY DEGREE PLAIN AND I ALREADY SAW CAUSE
TO DEEM THEM EXPRESSIVE
WHAT WAS THEIR PREDOMINANT CAST WAS IT
SAGACITY SENSE YES I THOUGHT SO BUT I COULD SCARCELY AS YET BE
SURE
I DISCOVERED HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS A CERTAIN SERENITY OF EYE
AND FRESHNESS OF COMPLEXION MOST PLEASING TO BEHOLD
THE COLOUR ON HER
CHEEK WAS LIKE THE BLOOM ON A GOOD APPLE WHICH IS AS SOUND AT THE CORE
AS IT IS RED ON THE RIND
MDLLE
REUTER AND I ENTERED UPON BUSINESS
SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE WISDOM OF THE STEP SHE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE
BECAUSE I WAS SO YOUNG AND PARENTS MIGHT POSSIBLY OBJECT TO A PROFESSOR
LIKE ME FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS BUT IT IS OFTEN WELL TO ACT ON ONE'S OWN
JUDGMENT SAID SHE AND TO LEAD PARENTS RATHER THAN BE LED BY THEM
THE FITNESS OF A PROFESSOR IS NOT A MATTER OF AGE AND FROM WHAT I HAVE
HEARD AND FROM WHAT I OBSERVE MYSELF I WOULD MUCH RATHER TRUST YOU
THAN M
LEDRU THE MUSIC MASTER WHO IS A MARRIED MAN OF NEAR FIFTY
I REMARKED THAT I HOPED SHE WOULD FIND ME WORTHY OF HER GOOD OPINION
THAT IF I KNEW MYSELF I WAS INCAPABLE OF BETRAYING ANY CONFIDENCE
REPOSED IN ME
DU RESTE SAID SHE THE SURVEILLANCE WILL BE STRICTLY
ATTENDED TO AND THEN SHE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT OF TERMS
SHE WAS VERY CAUTIOUS QUITE ON HER GUARD SHE DID NOT ABSOLUTELY
BARGAIN BUT SHE WARILY SOUNDED ME TO FIND OUT WHAT MY EXPECTATIONS
MIGHT BE AND WHEN SHE COULD NOT GET ME TO NAME A SUM SHE REASONED AND
REASONED WITH A FLUENT YET QUIET CIRCUMLOCUTION OF SPEECH AND AT LAST
NAILED ME DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER ANNUM NOT TOO MUCH BUT I
AGREED
BEFORE THE NEGOTIATION WAS COMPLETED IT BEGAN TO GROW A LITTLE
DUSK
I DID NOT HASTEN IT FOR I LIKED WELL ENOUGH TO SIT AND HEAR
HER TALK I WAS AMUSED WITH THE SORT OF BUSINESS TALENT SHE DISPLAYED
EDWARD COULD NOT HAVE SHOWN HIMSELF MORE PRACTICAL THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE
EVINCED MORE COARSENESS AND URGENCY AND THEN SHE HAD SO MANY REASONS
SO MANY EXPLANATIONS AND AFTER ALL SHE SUCCEEDED IN PROVING HERSELF
QUITE DISINTERESTED AND EVEN LIBERAL
AT LAST SHE CONCLUDED SHE COULD
SAY NO MORE BECAUSE AS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL THINGS THERE WAS NO
FURTHER GROUND FOR THE EXERCISE OF HER PARTS OF SPEECH
I WAS OBLIGED TO
RISE
I WOULD RATHER HAVE SAT A LITTLE LONGER WHAT HAD I TO RETURN TO
BUT MY SMALL EMPTY ROOM AND MY EYES HAD A PLEASURE IN LOOKING AT
MDLLE
REUTER ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN THE TWILIGHT SOFTENED HER FEATURES A
LITTLE AND IN THE DOUBTFUL DUSK I COULD FANCY HER FOREHEAD AS OPEN
AS IT WAS REALLY ELEVATED HER MOUTH TOUCHED WITH TURNS OF SWEETNESS
AS WELL AS DEFINED IN LINES OF SENSE
WHEN I ROSE TO GO I HELD OUT
MY HAND ON PURPOSE THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS CONTRARY TO THE ETIQUETTE OF
FOREIGN HABITS SHE SMILED AND SAID
AH C'EST COMME TOUS LES ANGLAIS BUT GAVE ME HER HAND VERY KINDLY
IT IS THE PRIVILEGE OF MY COUNTRY MADEMOISELLE SAID I AND
REMEMBER I SHALL ALWAYS CLAIM IT
SHE LAUGHED A LITTLE QUITE GOOD NATUREDLY AND WITH THE SORT OF
TRANQUILLITY OBVIOUS IN ALL SHE DID A TRANQUILLITY WHICH SOOTHED AND
SUITED ME SINGULARLY AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THAT EVENING
BRUSSELS
SEEMED A VERY PLEASANT PLACE TO ME WHEN I GOT OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREET
AND IT APPEARED AS IF SOME CHEERFUL EVENTFUL UPWARD TENDING CAREER
WERE EVEN THEN OPENING TO ME ON THAT SELFSAME MILD STILL APRIL NIGHT
SO IMPRESSIONABLE A BEING IS MAN OR AT LEAST SUCH A MAN AS I WAS IN
THOSE DAYS
CHAPTER X
NEXT DAY THE MORNING HOURS SEEMED TO PASS VERY SLOWLY AT M
PELET'S I
WANTED THE AFTERNOON TO COME THAT I MIGHT GO AGAIN TO THE NEIGHBOURING
PENSIONNAT AND GIVE MY FIRST LESSON WITHIN ITS PLEASANT PRECINCTS FOR
PLEASANT THEY APPEARED TO ME
AT NOON THE HOUR OF RECREATION ARRIVED AT
ONE O'CLOCK WE HAD LUNCH THIS GOT ON THE TIME AND AT LAST ST
GUDULE'S
DEEP BELL TOLLING SLOWLY TWO MARKED THE MOMENT FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN
WAITING
AT THE FOOT OF THE NARROW BACK STAIRS THAT DESCENDED FROM MY ROOM I MET
M
PELET
COMME VOUS AVEZ L'AIR RAYONNANT SAID HE
JE NE VOUS AI JAMAIS VU
AUSSI GAI
QUE S'EST IL DONC PASSE
APPAREMMENT QUE J'AIME LES CHANGEMENTS REPLIED I
AH JE COMPRENDS C'EST CELA SOYEZ SAGE SEULEMENT
VOUS ETES BIEN
JEUNE TROP JEUNE POUR LE ROLE QUE VOUS ALLEZ JOUER IL FAUT PRENDRE
GARDE SAVEZ VOUS
MAIS QUEL DANGER Y A T IL
JE N'EN SAIS RIEN NE VOUS LAISSEZ PAS ALLER A DE VIVES
IMPRESSIONS VOILA TOUT
I LAUGHED A SENTIMENT OF EXQUISITE PLEASURE PLAYED OVER MY NERVES AT
THE THOUGHT THAT VIVES IMPRESSIONS WERE LIKELY TO BE CREATED IT WAS
THE DEADNESS THE SAMENESS OF LIFE'S DAILY ONGOINGS THAT HAD HITHERTO
BEEN MY BANE MY BLOUSE CLAD ELEVES IN THE BOYS' SEMINARY NEVER
STIRRED IN ME ANY VIVES IMPRESSIONS EXCEPT IT MIGHT BE OCCASIONALLY
SOME OF ANGER
I BROKE FROM M
PELET AND AS I STRODE DOWN THE PASSAGE
HE FOLLOWED ME WITH ONE OF HIS LAUGHS A VERY FRENCH RAKISH MOCKING
SOUND
AGAIN I STOOD AT THE NEIGHBOURING DOOR AND SOON WAS RE ADMITTED INTO
THE CHEERFUL PASSAGE WITH ITS CLEAR DOVE COLOUR IMITATION MARBLE WALLS
I FOLLOWED THE PORTRESS AND DESCENDING A STEP AND MAKING A TURN I
FOUND MYSELF IN A SORT OF CORRIDOR A SIDE DOOR OPENED MDLLE
REUTER'S
LITTLE FIGURE AS GRACEFUL AS IT WAS PLUMP APPEARED
I COULD NOW SEE
HER DRESS IN FULL DAYLIGHT A NEAT SIMPLE MOUSSELINE LAINE GOWN FITTED
HER COMPACT ROUND SHAPE TO PERFECTION DELICATE LITTLE COLLAR AND
MANCHETTES OF LACE TRIM PARISIAN BRODEQUINS SHOWED HER NECK WRISTS
AND FEET TO COMPLETE ADVANTAGE BUT HOW GRAVE WAS HER FACE AS SHE
CAME SUDDENLY UPON ME SOLICITUDE AND BUSINESS WERE IN HER EYE ON HER
FOREHEAD SHE LOOKED ALMOST STERN
HER BON JOUR MONSIEUR WAS QUITE
POLITE BUT SO ORDERLY SO COMMONPLACE IT SPREAD DIRECTLY A COOL DAMP
TOWEL OVER MY VIVES IMPRESSIONS THE SERVANT TURNED BACK WHEN HER
MISTRESS APPEARED AND I WALKED SLOWLY ALONG THE CORRIDOR SIDE BY SIDE
WITH MDLLE
REUTER
MONSIEUR WILL GIVE A LESSON IN THE FIRST CLASS TO DAY SAID SHE
DICTATION OR READING WILL PERHAPS BE THE BEST THING TO BEGIN WITH FOR
THOSE ARE THE EASIEST FORMS OF COMMUNICATING INSTRUCTION IN A FOREIGN
LANGUAGE AND AT THE FIRST A MASTER NATURALLY FEELS A LITTLE
UNSETTLED
SHE WAS QUITE RIGHT AS I HAD FOUND FROM EXPERIENCE IT ONLY REMAINED
FOR ME TO ACQUIESCE
WE PROCEEDED NOW IN SILENCE
THE CORRIDOR
TERMINATED IN A HALL LARGE LOFTY AND SQUARE A GLASS DOOR ON ONE SIDE
SHOWED WITHIN A LONG NARROW REFECTORY WITH TABLES AN ARMOIRE AND
TWO LAMPS IT WAS EMPTY LARGE GLASS DOORS IN FRONT OPENED ON THE
PLAYGROUND AND GARDEN A BROAD STAIRCASE ASCENDED SPIRALLY ON THE
OPPOSITE SIDE THE REMAINING WALL SHOWED A PAIR OF GREAT FOLDING DOORS
NOW CLOSED AND ADMITTING DOUBTLESS TO THE CLASSES
MDLLE
REUTER TURNED HER EYE LATERALLY ON ME TO ASCERTAIN PROBABLY
WHETHER I WAS COLLECTED ENOUGH TO BE USHERED INTO HER SANCTUM SANCTORUM
I SUPPOSE SHE JUDGED ME TO BE IN A TOLERABLE STATE OF SELF GOVERNMENT
FOR SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND I FOLLOWED HER THROUGH
A RUSTLING SOUND OF
UPRISING GREETED OUR ENTRANCE WITHOUT LOOKING TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT I
WALKED STRAIGHT UP THE LANE BETWEEN TWO SETS OF BENCHES AND DESKS
AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE EMPTY CHAIR AND ISOLATED DESK RAISED ON AN
ESTRADE OF ONE STEP HIGH SO AS TO COMMAND ONE DIVISION THE OTHER
DIVISION BEING UNDER THE SURVEILLANCE OF A MAITRESSE SIMILARLY ELEVATED
AT THE BACK OF THE ESTRADE AND ATTACHED TO A MOVEABLE PARTITION
DIVIDING THIS SCHOOLROOM FROM ANOTHER BEYOND WAS A LARGE TABLEAU OF
WOOD PAINTED BLACK AND VARNISHED A THICK CRAYON OF WHITE CHALK LAY ON
MY DESK FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF ELUCIDATING ANY GRAMMATICAL OR VERBAL
OBSCURITY WHICH MIGHT OCCUR IN MY LESSONS BY WRITING IT UPON THE
TABLEAU A WET SPONGE APPEARED BESIDE THE CHALK TO ENABLE ME TO EFFACE
THE MARKS WHEN THEY HAD SERVED THE PURPOSE INTENDED
I CAREFULLY AND DELIBERATELY MADE THESE OBSERVATIONS BEFORE ALLOWING
MYSELF TO TAKE ONE GLANCE AT THE BENCHES BEFORE ME HAVING HANDLED THE
CRAYON LOOKED BACK AT THE TABLEAU FINGERED THE SPONGE IN ORDER TO
ASCERTAIN THAT IT WAS IN A RIGHT STATE OF MOISTURE I FOUND MYSELF COOL
ENOUGH TO ADMIT OF LOOKING CALMLY UP AND GAZING DELIBERATELY ROUND ME
AND FIRST I OBSERVED THAT MDLLE
REUTER HAD ALREADY GLIDED AWAY SHE
WAS NOWHERE VISIBLE A MAITRESSE OR TEACHER THE ONE WHO OCCUPIED THE
CORRESPONDING ESTRADE TO MY OWN ALONE REMAINED TO KEEP GUARD OVER ME
SHE WAS A LITTLE IN THE SHADE AND WITH MY SHORT SIGHT I COULD ONLY
SEE THAT SHE WAS OF A THIN BONY FIGURE AND RATHER TALLOWY COMPLEXION
AND THAT HER ATTITUDE AS SHE SAT PARTOOK EQUALLY OF LISTLESSNESS AND
AFFECTATION
MORE OBVIOUS MORE PROMINENT SHONE ON BY THE FULL LIGHT OF
THE LARGE WINDOW WERE THE OCCUPANTS OF THE BENCHES JUST BEFORE ME OF
WHOM SOME WERE GIRLS OF FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SOME YOUNG WOMEN
FROM EIGHTEEN AS IT APPEARED TO ME UP TO TWENTY THE MOST MODEST
ATTIRE THE SIMPLEST FASHION OF WEARING THE HAIR WERE APPARENT IN ALL
AND GOOD FEATURES RUDDY BLOOMING COMPLEXIONS LARGE AND BRILLIANT
EYES FORMS FULL EVEN TO SOLIDITY SEEMED TO ABOUND
I DID NOT BEAR
THE FIRST VIEW LIKE A STOIC I WAS DAZZLED MY EYES FELL AND IN A VOICE
SOMEWHAT TOO LOW I MURMURED
PRENEZ VOS CAHIERS DE DICTEE MESDEMOISELLES
NOT SO HAD I BID THE BOYS AT PELET'S TAKE THEIR READING BOOKS
A
RUSTLE FOLLOWED AND AN OPENING OF DESKS BEHIND THE LIFTED LIDS WHICH
MOMENTARILY SCREENED THE HEADS BENT DOWN TO SEARCH FOR EXERCISE BOOKS I
HEARD TITTERING AND WHISPERS
EULALIE JE SUIS PRETE A PLEUER DE RIRE OBSERVED ONE
COMME IL A ROUGI EN PARLANT
OUI C'EST UN VERITABLE BLANC BEC
TAIS TOI HORTENSE IL NOUS ECOUTE
AND NOW THE LIDS SANK AND THE HEADS REAPPEARED I HAD MARKED THREE THE
WHISPERERS AND I DID NOT SCRUPLE TO TAKE A VERY STEADY LOOK AT THEM AS
THEY EMERGED FROM THEIR TEMPORARY ECLIPSE
IT IS ASTONISHING WHAT EASE
AND COURAGE THEIR LITTLE PHRASES OF FLIPPANCY HAD GIVEN ME THE IDEA BY
WHICH I HAD BEEN AWED WAS THAT THE YOUTHFUL BEINGS BEFORE ME WITH THEIR
DARK NUN LIKE ROBES AND SOFTLY BRAIDED HAIR WERE A KIND OF HALF ANGELS
THE LIGHT TITTER THE GIDDY WHISPER HAD ALREADY IN SOME MEASURE
RELIEVED MY MIND OF THAT FOND AND OPPRESSIVE FANCY
THE THREE I ALLUDE TO WERE JUST IN FRONT WITHIN HALF A YARD OF MY
ESTRADE AND WERE AMONG THE MOST WOMANLY LOOKING PRESENT
THEIR NAMES
I KNEW AFTERWARDS AND MAY AS WELL MENTION NOW THEY WERE EULALIE
HORTENSE CAROLINE
EULALIE WAS TALL AND VERY FINELY SHAPED SHE WAS
FAIR AND HER FEATURES WERE THOSE OF A LOW COUNTRY MADONNA MANY A
FIGURE DE VIERGE HAVE I SEEN IN DUTCH PICTURES EXACTLY RESEMBLING
HERS THERE WERE NO ANGLES IN HER SHAPE OR IN HER FACE ALL WAS CURVE
AND ROUNDNESS NEITHER THOUGHT SENTIMENT NOR PASSION DISTURBED BY LINE
OR FLUSH THE EQUALITY OF HER PALE CLEAR SKIN HER NOBLE BUST HEAVED
WITH HER REGULAR BREATHING HER EYES MOVED A LITTLE BY THESE EVIDENCES
OF LIFE ALONE COULD I HAVE DISTINGUISHED HER FROM SOME LARGE HANDSOME
FIGURE MOULDED IN WAX
HORTENSE WAS OF MIDDLE SIZE AND STOUT HER
FORM WAS UNGRACEFUL HER FACE STRIKING MORE ALIVE AND BRILLIANT THAN
EULALIE'S HER HAIR WAS DARK BROWN HER COMPLEXION RICHLY COLOURED
THERE WERE FROLIC AND MISCHIEF IN HER EYE CONSISTENCY AND GOOD SENSE
SHE MIGHT POSSESS BUT NONE OF HER FEATURES BETOKENED THOSE QUALITIES
CAROLINE WAS LITTLE THOUGH EVIDENTLY FULL GROWN RAVEN BLACK HAIR
VERY DARK EYES ABSOLUTELY REGULAR FEATURES WITH A COLOURLESS OLIVE
COMPLEXION CLEAR AS TO THE FACE AND SALLOW ABOUT THE NECK FORMED IN
HER THAT ASSEMBLAGE OF POINTS WHOSE UNION MANY PERSONS REGARD AS THE
PERFECTION OF BEAUTY
HOW WITH THE TINTLESS PALLOR OF HER SKIN AND THE
CLASSIC STRAIGHTNESS OF HER LINEAMENTS SHE MANAGED TO LOOK SENSUAL I
DON'T KNOW
I THINK HER LIPS AND EYES CONTRIVED THE AFFAIR BETWEEN
THEM AND THE RESULT LEFT NO UNCERTAINTY ON THE BEHOLDER'S MIND
SHE WAS
SENSUAL NOW AND IN TEN YEARS' TIME SHE WOULD BE COARSE PROMISE PLAIN
WAS WRITTEN IN HER FACE OF MUCH FUTURE FOLLY
IF I LOOKED AT THESE GIRLS WITH LITTLE SCRUPLE THEY LOOKED AT ME
WITH STILL LESS
EULALIE RAISED HER UNMOVED EYE TO MINE AND SEEMED TO
EXPECT PASSIVELY BUT SECURELY AN IMPROMPTU TRIBUTE TO HER MAJESTIC
CHARMS
HORTENSE REGARDED ME BOLDLY AND GIGGLED AT THE SAME TIME WHILE
SHE SAID WITH AN AIR OF IMPUDENT FREEDOM
DICTEZ NOUS QUELQUECHOSE DE FACILE POUR COMMENCER MONSIEUR
CAROLINE SHOOK HER LOOSE RINGLETS OF ABUNDANT BUT SOMEWHAT COARSE HAIR
OVER HER ROLLING BLACK EYES PARTING HER LIPS AS FULL AS THOSE OF A
HOT BLOODED MAROON SHE SHOWED HER WELL SET TEETH SPARKLING BETWEEN
THEM AND TREATED ME AT THE SAME TIME TO A SMILE DE SA FACON
BEAUTIFUL AS PAULINE BORGHESE SHE LOOKED AT THE MOMENT SCARCELY PURER
THAN LUCRECE DE BORGIA
CAROLINE WAS OF NOBLE FAMILY
I HEARD HER
LADY MOTHER'S CHARACTER AFTERWARDS AND THEN I CEASED TO WONDER AT THE
PRECOCIOUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE DAUGHTER
THESE THREE I AT ONCE SAW
DEEMED THEMSELVES THE QUEENS OF THE SCHOOL AND CONCEIVED THAT BY THEIR
SPLENDOUR THEY THREW ALL THE REST INTO THE SHADE
IN LESS THAN FIVE
MINUTES THEY HAD THUS REVEALED TO ME THEIR CHARACTERS AND IN LESS THAN
FIVE MINUTES I HAD BUCKLED ON A BREAST PLATE OF STEELY INDIFFERENCE AND
LET DOWN A VISOR OF IMPASSIBLE AUSTERITY
TAKE YOUR PENS AND COMMENCE WRITING SAID I IN AS DRY AND TRITE A
VOICE AS IF I HAD BEEN ADDRESSING ONLY JULES VANDERKELKOV AND CO
THE DICTEE NOW COMMENCED
MY THREE BELLES INTERRUPTED ME PERPETUALLY
WITH LITTLE SILLY QUESTIONS AND UNCALLED FOR REMARKS TO SOME OF WHICH I
MADE NO ANSWER AND TO OTHERS REPLIED VERY QUIETLY AND BRIEFLY
COMMENT
DIT ON POINT ET VIRGULE EN ANGLAIS MONSIEUR
SEMI COLON MADEMOISELLE
SEMI COLLONG AH COMME C'EST DROLE GIGGLE
J'AI UNE SI MAUVAISE PLUME IMPOSSIBLE D'ECRIRE
MAIS MONSIEUR JE NE SAIS PAS SUIVRE VOUS ALLEZ SI VITE
JE N'AI RIEN COMPRIS MOI
HERE A GENERAL MURMUR AROSE AND THE TEACHER OPENING HER LIPS FOR THE
FIRST TIME EJACULATED
SILENCE MESDEMOISELLES
NO SILENCE FOLLOWED ON THE CONTRARY THE THREE LADIES IN FRONT BEGAN TO
TALK MORE LOUDLY
C'EST SI DIFFICILE L'ANGLAIS
JE DETESTE LA DICTEE
QUEL ENNUI D'ECRIRE QUELQUECHOSE QUE L'ON NE COMPREND PAS
SOME OF THOSE BEHIND LAUGHED A DEGREE OF CONFUSION BEGAN TO PERVADE THE
CLASS IT WAS NECESSARY TO TAKE PROMPT MEASURES
DONNEZ MOI VOTRE CAHIER SAID I TO EULALIE IN AN ABRUPT TONE AND
BENDING OVER I TOOK IT BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO GIVE IT
ET VOUS MADEMOISELLE DONNEZ MOI LE VOTRE CONTINUED I MORE MILDLY
ADDRESSING A LITTLE PALE PLAIN LOOKING GIRL WHO SAT IN THE FIRST ROW OF
THE OTHER DIVISION AND WHOM I HAD REMARKED AS BEING AT ONCE THE UGLIEST
AND THE MOST ATTENTIVE IN THE ROOM SHE ROSE UP WALKED OVER TO ME AND
DELIVERED HER BOOK WITH A GRAVE MODEST CURTSEY
I GLANCED OVER THE
TWO DICTATIONS EULALIE'S WAS SLURRED BLOTTED AND FULL OF SILLY
MISTAKES SYLVIE'S SUCH WAS THE NAME OF THE UGLY LITTLE GIRL WAS
CLEARLY WRITTEN IT CONTAINED NO ERROR AGAINST SENSE AND BUT FEW
FAULTS OF ORTHOGRAPHY
I COOLLY READ ALOUD BOTH EXERCISES MARKING THE
FAULTS THEN I LOOKED AT EULALIE
C'EST HONTEUX SAID I AND I DELIBERATELY TORE HER DICTATION IN FOUR
PARTS AND PRESENTED HER WITH THE FRAGMENTS
I RETURNED SYLVIE HER BOOK
WITH A SMILE SAYING
C'EST BIEN JE SUIS CONTENT DE VOUS
SYLVIE LOOKED CALMLY PLEASED EULALIE SWELLED LIKE AN INCENSED TURKEY
BUT THE MUTINY WAS QUELLED THE CONCEITED COQUETRY AND FUTILE FLIRTATION
OF THE FIRST BENCH WERE EXCHANGED FOR A TACITURN SULLENNESS MUCH MORE
CONVENIENT TO ME AND THE REST OF MY LESSON PASSED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
A BELL CLANGING OUT IN THE YARD ANNOUNCED THE MOMENT FOR THE CESSATION
OF SCHOOL LABOURS
I HEARD OUR OWN BELL AT THE SAME TIME AND THAT OF A
CERTAIN PUBLIC COLLEGE IMMEDIATELY AFTER
ORDER DISSOLVED INSTANTLY UP
STARTED EVERY PUPIL I HASTENED TO SEIZE MY HAT BOW TO THE MAITRESSE
AND QUIT THE ROOM BEFORE THE TIDE OF EXTERNATS SHOULD POUR FROM THE
INNER CLASS WHERE I KNEW NEAR A HUNDRED WERE PRISONED AND WHOSE RISING
TUMULT I ALREADY HEARD
I HAD SCARCELY CROSSED THE HALL AND GAINED THE CORRIDOR WHEN MDLLE
REUTER CAME AGAIN UPON ME
STEP IN HERE A MOMENT SAID SHE AND SHE HELD OPEN THE DOOR OF
THE SIDE ROOM FROM WHENCE SHE HAD ISSUED ON MY ARRIVAL IT WAS A
SALLE A MANGER AS APPEARED FROM THE BEAUFET AND THE ARMOIRE VITREE
FILLED WITH GLASS AND CHINA WHICH FORMED PART OF ITS FURNITURE
ERE SHE
HAD CLOSED THE DOOR ON ME AND HERSELF THE CORRIDOR WAS ALREADY FILLED
WITH DAY PUPILS TEARING DOWN THEIR CLOAKS BONNETS AND CABAS FROM
THE WOODEN PEGS ON WHICH THEY WERE SUSPENDED THE SHRILL VOICE OF A
MAITRESSE WAS HEARD AT INTERVALS VAINLY ENDEAVOURING TO ENFORCE SOME
SORT OF ORDER VAINLY I SAY DISCIPLINE THERE WAS NONE IN THESE ROUGH
RANKS AND YET THIS WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST CONDUCTED SCHOOLS IN
BRUSSELS
WELL YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR FIRST LESSON BEGAN MDLLE
REUTER IN THE
MOST CALM EQUABLE VOICE AS THOUGH QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE CHAOS FROM
WHICH WE WERE SEPARATED ONLY BY A SINGLE WALL
WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH YOUR PUPILS OR DID ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IN THEIR
CONDUCT GIVE YOU CAUSE FOR COMPLAINT CONCEAL NOTHING FROM ME REPOSE IN
ME ENTIRE CONFIDENCE
HAPPILY I FELT IN MYSELF COMPLETE POWER TO MANAGE MY PUPILS WITHOUT
AID THE ENCHANTMENT THE GOLDEN HAZE WHICH HAD DAZZLED MY PERSPICUITY
AT FIRST HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL DISSIPATED
I CANNOT SAY I WAS CHAGRINED
OR DOWNCAST BY THE CONTRAST WHICH THE REALITY OF A PENSIONNAT DE
DEMOISELLES PRESENTED TO MY VAGUE IDEAL OF THE SAME COMMUNITY I WAS
ONLY ENLIGHTENED AND AMUSED CONSEQUENTLY I FELT IN NO DISPOSITION TO
COMPLAIN TO MDLLE
REUTER AND I RECEIVED HER CONSIDERATE INVITATION TO
CONFIDENCE WITH A SMILE
A THOUSAND THANKS MADEMOISELLE ALL HAS GONE VERY SMOOTHLY
SHE LOOKED MORE THAN DOUBTFUL
ET LES TROIS DEMOISELLES DU PREMIER BANC SAID SHE
AH TOUT VA AU MIEUX WAS MY ANSWER AND MDLLE
REUTER CEASED TO
QUESTION ME BUT HER EYE NOT LARGE NOT BRILLIANT NOT MELTING OR
KINDLING BUT ASTUTE PENETRATING PRACTICAL SHOWED SHE WAS EVEN WITH
ME IT LET OUT A MOMENTARY GLEAM WHICH SAID PLAINLY BE AS CLOSE AS
YOU LIKE I AM NOT DEPENDENT ON YOUR CANDOUR WHAT YOU WOULD CONCEAL I
ALREADY KNOW
BY A TRANSITION SO QUIET AS TO BE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE THE DIRECTRESS'S
MANNER CHANGED THE ANXIOUS BUSINESS AIR PASSED FROM HER FACE AND SHE
BEGAN CHATTING ABOUT THE WEATHER AND THE TOWN AND ASKING IN NEIGHBOURLY
WISE AFTER M
AND MADAME PELET
I ANSWERED ALL HER LITTLE QUESTIONS SHE
PROLONGED HER TALK I WENT ON FOLLOWING ITS MANY LITTLE WINDINGS SHE
SAT SO LONG SAID SO MUCH VARIED SO OFTEN THE TOPICS OF DISCOURSE
THAT IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO PERCEIVE SHE HAD A PARTICULAR AIM IN THUS
DETAINING ME
HER MERE WORDS COULD HAVE AFFORDED NO CLUE TO THIS
AIM BUT HER COUNTENANCE AIDED WHILE HER LIPS UTTERED ONLY AFFABLE
COMMONPLACES HER EYES REVERTED CONTINUALLY TO MY FACE
HER GLANCES WERE
NOT GIVEN IN FULL BUT OUT OF THE CORNERS SO QUIETLY SO STEALTHILY
YET I THINK I LOST NOT ONE
I WATCHED HER AS KEENLY AS SHE WATCHED ME
I PERCEIVED SOON THAT SHE WAS FEELING AFTER MY REAL CHARACTER SHE WAS
SEARCHING FOR SALIENT POINTS AND WEAK POINTS AND ECCENTRIC POINTS
SHE WAS APPLYING NOW THIS TEST NOW THAT HOPING IN THE END TO FIND SOME
CHINK SOME NICHE WHERE SHE COULD PUT IN HER LITTLE FIRM FOOT AND STAND
UPON MY NECK MISTRESS OF MY NATURE
DO NOT MISTAKE ME READER IT WAS
NO AMOROUS INFLUENCE SHE WISHED TO GAIN AT THAT TIME IT WAS ONLY THE
POWER OF THE POLITICIAN TO WHICH SHE ASPIRED I WAS NOW INSTALLED AS A
PROFESSOR IN HER ESTABLISHMENT AND SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE HER MIND
WAS SUPERIOR TO MINE BY WHAT FEELING OR OPINION SHE COULD LEAD ME
I ENJOYED THE GAME MUCH AND DID NOT HASTEN ITS CONCLUSION SOMETIMES I
GAVE HER HOPES BEGINNING A SENTENCE RATHER WEAKLY WHEN HER SHREWD EYE
WOULD LIGHT UP SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD ME HAVING LED HER A LITTLE WAY I
DELIGHTED TO TURN ROUND AND FINISH WITH SOUND HARD SENSE WHEREAT HER
COUNTENANCE WOULD FALL
AT LAST A SERVANT ENTERED TO ANNOUNCE DINNER
THE CONFLICT BEING THUS NECESSARILY TERMINATED WE PARTED WITHOUT HAVING
GAINED ANY ADVANTAGE ON EITHER SIDE MDLLE
REUTER HAD NOT EVEN GIVEN
ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF ATTACKING HER WITH FEELING AND I HAD MANAGED TO
BAFFLE HER LITTLE SCHEMES OF CRAFT
IT WAS A REGULAR DRAWN BATTLE
I
AGAIN HELD OUT MY HAND WHEN I LEFT THE ROOM SHE GAVE ME HERS IT WAS A
SMALL AND WHITE HAND BUT HOW COOL I MET HER EYE TOO IN FULL OBLIGING
HER TO GIVE ME A STRAIGHTFORWARD LOOK THIS LAST TEST WENT AGAINST
ME IT LEFT HER AS IT FOUND HER MODERATE TEMPERATE TRANQUIL ME IT
DISAPPOINTED
I AM GROWING WISER THOUGHT I AS I WALKED BACK TO M
PELET'S
LOOK
AT THIS LITTLE WOMAN IS SHE LIKE THE WOMEN OF NOVELISTS AND ROMANCERS
TO READ OF FEMALE CHARACTER AS DEPICTED IN POETRY AND FICTION ONE WOULD
THINK IT WAS MADE UP OF SENTIMENT EITHER FOR GOOD OR BAD HERE IS
A SPECIMEN AND A MOST SENSIBLE AND RESPECTABLE SPECIMEN TOO WHOSE
STAPLE INGREDIENT IS ABSTRACT REASON
NO TALLEYRAND WAS EVER MORE
PASSIONLESS THAN ZORAIDE REUTER SO I THOUGHT THEN I FOUND
AFTERWARDS THAT BLUNT SUSCEPTIBILITIES ARE VERY CONSISTENT WITH STRONG
PROPENSITIES
CHAPTER XI
I HAD INDEED HAD A VERY LONG TALK WITH THE CRAFTY LITTLE POLITICIAN AND
ON REGAINING MY QUARTERS I FOUND THAT DINNER WAS HALF OVER
TO BE LATE
AT MEALS WAS AGAINST A STANDING RULE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND HAD IT
BEEN ONE OF THE FLEMISH USHERS WHO THUS ENTERED AFTER THE REMOVAL OF THE
SOUP AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE FIRST COURSE M
PELET WOULD PROBABLY
HAVE GREETED HIM WITH A PUBLIC REBUKE AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MULCTED
HIM BOTH OF SOUP AND FISH AS IT WAS THAT POLITE THOUGH PARTIAL
GENTLEMAN ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND AS I TOOK MY PLACE UNROLLED MY
NAPKIN AND SAID MY HERETICAL GRACE TO MYSELF HE CIVILLY DESPATCHED A
SERVANT TO THE KITCHEN TO BRING ME A PLATE OF PUREE AUX CAROTTES
FOR THIS WAS A MAIGRE DAY AND BEFORE SENDING AWAY THE FIRST COURSE
RESERVED FOR ME A PORTION OF THE STOCK FISH OF WHICH IT CONSISTED
DINNER BEING OVER THE BOYS RUSHED OUT FOR THEIR EVENING PLAY KINT AND
VANDAM THE TWO USHERS OF COURSE FOLLOWED THEM
POOR FELLOWS IF THEY
HAD NOT LOOKED SO VERY HEAVY SO VERY SOULLESS SO VERY INDIFFERENT TO
ALL THINGS IN HEAVEN ABOVE OR IN THE EARTH BENEATH I COULD HAVE PITIED
THEM GREATLY FOR THE OBLIGATION THEY WERE UNDER TO TRAIL AFTER THOSE
ROUGH LADS EVERYWHERE AND AT ALL TIMES EVEN AS IT WAS I FELT DISPOSED
TO SCOUT MYSELF AS A PRIVILEGED PRIG WHEN I TURNED TO ASCEND TO MY
CHAMBER SURE TO FIND THERE IF NOT ENJOYMENT AT LEAST LIBERTY BUT
THIS EVENING AS HAD OFTEN HAPPENED BEFORE I WAS TO BE STILL FARTHER
DISTINGUISHED
EH BIEN MAUVAIS SUJET SAID THE VOICE OF M
PELET BEHIND ME AS I
SET MY FOOT ON THE FIRST STEP OF THE STAIR OU ALLEZ VOUS VENEZ A LA
SALLE A MANGER QUE JE VOUS GRONDE UN PEU
I BEG PARDON MONSIEUR SAID I AS I FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS PRIVATE
SITTING ROOM FOR HAVING RETURNED SO LATE IT WAS NOT MY FAULT
THAT IS JUST WHAT I WANT TO KNOW REJOINED M
PELET AS HE USHERED ME
INTO THE COMFORTABLE PARLOUR WITH A GOOD WOOD FIRE FOR THE STOVE HAD
NOW BEEN REMOVED FOR THE SEASON
HAVING RUNG THE BELL HE ORDERED COFFEE
FOR TWO AND PRESENTLY HE AND I WERE SEATED ALMOST IN ENGLISH COMFORT
ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE HEARTH A LITTLE ROUND TABLE BETWEEN US WITH
A COFFEE POT A SUGAR BASIN AND TWO LARGE WHITE CHINA CUPS
WHILE
M
PELET EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN CHOOSING A CIGAR FROM A BOX MY THOUGHTS
REVERTED TO THE TWO OUTCAST USHERS WHOSE VOICES I COULD HEAR EVEN NOW
CRYING HOARSELY FOR ORDER IN THE PLAYGROUND
C'EST UNE GRANDE RESPONSABILITE QUE LA SURVEILLANCE OBSERVED I
PLAIT IL DIT M
PELET
I REMARKED THAT I THOUGHT MESSIEURS VANDAM AND KINT MUST SOMETIMES BE A
LITTLE FATIGUED WITH THEIR LABOURS
DES BETES DE SOMME DES BETES DE SOMME MURMURED SCORNFULLY THE
DIRECTOR
MEANTIME I OFFERED HIM HIS CUP OF COFFEE
SERVEZ VOUS MON GARCON SAID HE BLANDLY WHEN I HAD PUT A COUPLE OF
HUGE LUMPS OF CONTINENTAL SUGAR INTO HIS CUP
AND NOW TELL ME WHY YOU
STAYED SO LONG AT MDLLE
REUTER'S
I KNOW THAT LESSONS CONCLUDE IN HER
ESTABLISHMENT AS IN MINE AT FOUR O'CLOCK AND WHEN YOU RETURNED IT WAS
PAST FIVE
MDLLE
WISHED TO SPEAK WITH ME MONSIEUR
INDEED ON WHAT SUBJECT IF ONE MAY ASK
MADEMOISELLE TALKED ABOUT NOTHING MONSIEUR
A FERTILE TOPIC AND DID SHE DISCOURSE THEREON IN THE SCHOOLROOM
BEFORE THE PUPILS
NO LIKE YOU MONSIEUR SHE ASKED ME TO WALK INTO HER PARLOUR
AND MADAME REUTER THE OLD DUENNA MY MOTHER'S GOSSIP WAS THERE OF
COURSE
NO MONSIEUR I HAD THE HONOUR OF BEING QUITE ALONE WITH MADEMOISELLE
C'EST JOLI CELA OBSERVED M
PELET AND HE SMILED AND LOOKED INTO THE
FIRE
HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE MURMURED I SIGNIFICANTLY
JE CONNAIS UN PEU MA PETITE VOISINE VOYEZ VOUS
IN THAT CASE MONSIEUR WILL BE ABLE TO AID ME IN FINDING OUT WHAT WAS
MADEMOISELLE'S REASON FOR MAKING ME SIT BEFORE HER SOFA ONE MORTAL HOUR
LISTENING TO THE MOST COPIOUS AND FLUENT DISSERTATION ON THE MEREST
FRIVOLITIES
SHE WAS SOUNDING YOUR CHARACTER
I THOUGHT SO MONSIEUR
DID SHE FIND OUT YOUR WEAK POINT
WHAT IS MY WEAK POINT
WHY THE SENTIMENTAL
ANY WOMAN SINKING HER SHAFT DEEP ENOUGH WILL
AT LAST REACH A FATHOMLESS SPRING OF SENSIBILITY IN THY BREAST
CRIMSWORTH
I FELT THE BLOOD STIR ABOUT MY HEART AND RISE WARM TO MY CHEEK
SOME WOMEN MIGHT MONSIEUR
IS MDLLE
REUTER OF THE NUMBER COME SPEAK FRANKLY MON FILS ELLE EST
ENCORE JEUNE PLUS AGEE QUE TOI PEUT ETRE MAIS JUSTE ASSEY POUR UNIR
LA TENDRESSE D'UNE PETITE MAMAN A L'AMOUR D'UNE EPOUSE DEVOUEE N'EST CE
PAS QUE CELA T'IRAIT SUPERIEUREMENT
NO MONSIEUR I SHOULD LIKE MY WIFE TO BE MY WIFE AND NOT HALF MY
MOTHER
SHE IS THEN A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR YOU
NO MONSIEUR NOT A DAY TOO OLD IF SHE SUITED ME IN OTHER THINGS
IN WHAT DOES SHE NOT SUIT YOU WILLIAM SHE IS PERSONALLY AGREEABLE IS
SHE NOT
VERY HER HAIR AND COMPLEXION ARE JUST WHAT I ADMIRE AND HER TURN OF
FORM THOUGH QUITE BELGIAN IS FULL OF GRACE
BRAVO AND HER FACE HER FEATURES HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM
A LITTLE HARSH ESPECIALLY HER MOUTH

PELET AND HE CHUCKLED INWARDLY

RATHER CRAFTY
TRUE BUT THAT EXPRESSION OF CRAFT IS OWING TO HER EYEBROWS HAVE YOU
REMARKED HER EYEBROWS
I ANSWERED THAT I HAD NOT

NO
IT IS A TREAT NOTWITHSTANDING
OBSERVE HER WHEN SHE HAS SOME KNITTING
OR SOME OTHER WOMAN'S WORK IN HAND AND SITS THE IMAGE OF PEACE CALMLY
INTENT ON HER NEEDLES AND HER SILK SOME DISCUSSION MEANTIME GOING ON
AROUND HER IN THE COURSE OF WHICH PECULIARITIES OF CHARACTER ARE BEING
DEVELOPED OR IMPORTANT INTERESTS CANVASSED SHE TAKES NO PART IN IT
HER HUMBLE FEMININE MIND IS WHOLLY WITH HER KNITTING NONE OF HER
FEATURES MOVE SHE NEITHER PRESUMES TO SMILE APPROVAL NOR FROWN
DISAPPROBATION HER LITTLE HANDS ASSIDUOUSLY PLY THEIR UNPRETENDING
TASK IF SHE CAN ONLY GET THIS PURSE FINISHED OR THIS BONNET GREC
COMPLETED IT IS ENOUGH FOR HER
IF GENTLEMEN APPROACH HER CHAIR A
DEEPER QUIESCENCE A MEEKER MODESTY SETTLES ON HER FEATURES AND CLOTHES
HER GENERAL MIEN OBSERVE THEN HER EYEBROWS ET DITES MOI S'IL N'Y A PAS
DU CHAT DANS L'UN ET DU RENARD DANS L'AUTRE
I WILL TAKE CAREFUL NOTICE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY SAID I
AND THEN CONTINUED M
PELET THE EYELID WILL FLICKER THE
LIGHT COLOURED LASHES BE LIFTED A SECOND AND A BLUE EYE GLANCING OUT
FROM UNDER THE SCREEN WILL TAKE ITS BRIEF SLY SEARCHING SURVEY AND
RETREAT AGAIN
I SMILED AND SO DID PELET AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES' SILENCE I ASKED
WILL SHE EVER MARRY DO YOU THINK
MARRY WILL BIRDS PAIR OF COURSE IT IS BOTH HER INTENTION AND
RESOLUTION TO MARRY WHEN SHE FINDS A SUITABLE MATCH AND NO ONE IS
BETTER AWARE THAN HERSELF OF THE SORT OF IMPRESSION SHE IS CAPABLE
OF PRODUCING NO ONE LIKES BETTER TO CAPTIVATE IN A QUIET WAY
I AM
MISTAKEN IF SHE WILL NOT YET LEAVE THE PRINT OF HER STEALING STEPS ON
THY HEART CRIMSWORTH
OF HER STEPS CONFOUND IT NO MY HEART IS NOT A PLANK TO BE WALKED
ON
BUT THE SOFT TOUCH OF A PATTE DE VELOURS WILL DO IT NO HARM
SHE OFFERS ME NO PATTE DE VELOURS SHE IS ALL FORM AND RESERVE WITH
ME
THAT TO BEGIN WITH LET RESPECT BE THE FOUNDATION AFFECTION THE FIRST
FLOOR LOVE THE SUPERSTRUCTURE MDLLE
REUTER IS A SKILFUL ARCHITECT
AND INTEREST M
PELET INTEREST
WILL NOT MADEMOISELLE CONSIDER THAT
POINT
YES YES NO DOUBT IT WILL BE THE CEMENT BETWEEN EVERY STONE
AND NOW
WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE DIRECTRESS WHAT OF THE PUPILS N'Y A T IL PAS DE
BELLES ETUDES PARMI CES JEUNES TETES
STUDIES OF CHARACTER YES CURIOUS ONES AT LEAST I IMAGINE BUT ONE
CANNOT DIVINE MUCH FROM A FIRST INTERVIEW
AH YOU AFFECT DISCRETION BUT TELL ME NOW WERE YOU NOT A LITTLE
ABASHED BEFORE THESE BLOOMING YOUNG CREATURES
AT FIRST YES BUT I RALLIED AND GOT THROUGH WITH ALL DUE SANG FROID
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU
IT IS TRUE NOTWITHSTANDING
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THEM ANGELS BUT THEY
DID NOT LEAVE ME LONG UNDER THAT DELUSION THREE OF THE ELDEST AND
HANDSOMEST UNDERTOOK THE TASK OF SETTING ME RIGHT AND THEY MANAGED
SO CLEVERLY THAT IN FIVE MINUTES I KNEW THEM AT LEAST FOR WHAT THEY
WERE THREE ARRANT COQUETTES
JE LES CONNAIS EXCLAIMED M
PELET
ELLES SONT TOUJOURS AU PREMIER
RANG A L'EGLISE ET A LA PROMENADE UNE BLONDE SUPERBE UNE JOLIE
ESPIEGLE UNE BELLE BRUNE
EXACTLY
LOVELY CREATURES ALL OF THEM HEADS FOR ARTISTS WHAT A GROUP THEY
WOULD MAKE TAKEN TOGETHER EULALIE I KNOW THEIR NAMES WITH HER
SMOOTH BRAIDED HAIR AND CALM IVORY BROW
HORTENSE WITH HER RICH CHESNUT
LOCKS SO LUXURIANTLY KNOTTED PLAITED TWISTED AS IF SHE DID NOT KNOW
HOW TO DISPOSE OF ALL THEIR ABUNDANCE WITH HER VERMILION LIPS DAMASK
CHEEK AND ROGUISH LAUGHING EYE
AND CAROLINE DE BLEMONT AH THERE IS
BEAUTY BEAUTY IN PERFECTION
WHAT A CLOUD OF SABLE CURLS ABOUT THE FACE
OF A HOURI WHAT FASCINATING LIPS WHAT GLORIOUS BLACK EYES YOUR BYRON
WOULD HAVE WORSHIPPED HER AND YOU YOU COLD FRIGID ISLANDER YOU
PLAYED THE AUSTERE THE INSENSIBLE IN THE PRESENCE OF AN APHRODITE SO
EXQUISITE
I MIGHT HAVE LAUGHED AT THE DIRECTOR'S ENTHUSIASM HAD I BELIEVED
IT REAL BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS TONE WHICH INDICATED GOT UP
RAPTURES
I FELT HE WAS ONLY AFFECTING FERVOUR IN ORDER TO PUT ME OFF MY
GUARD TO INDUCE ME TO COME OUT IN RETURN SO I SCARCELY EVEN SMILED
HE
WENT ON
CONFESS WILLIAM DO NOT THE MERE GOOD LOOKS OF ZORAIDE REUTER APPEAR
DOWDYISH AND COMMONPLACE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID CHARMS OF SOME OF
HER PUPILS
THE QUESTION DISCOMPOSED ME BUT I NOW FELT PLAINLY THAT MY PRINCIPAL
WAS ENDEAVOURING FOR REASONS BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF AT THAT TIME I
COULD NOT FATHOM THEM TO EXCITE IDEAS AND WISHES IN MY MIND ALIEN TO
WHAT WAS RIGHT AND HONOURABLE
THE INIQUITY OF THE INSTIGATION PROVED
ITS ANTIDOTE AND WHEN HE FURTHER ADDED
EACH OF THOSE THREE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS WILL HAVE A HANDSOME FORTUNE AND
WITH A LITTLE ADDRESS A GENTLEMANLIKE INTELLIGENT YOUNG FELLOW LIKE
YOU MIGHT MAKE HIMSELF MASTER OF THE HAND HEART AND PURSE OF ANY ONE
OF THE TRIO
I REPLIED BY A LOOK AND AN INTERROGATIVE MONSIEUR WHICH STARTLED HIM
HE LAUGHED A FORCED LAUGH AFFIRMED THAT HE HAD ONLY BEEN JOKING AND
DEMANDED WHETHER I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE THOUGHT HIM IN EARNEST
JUST THEN
THE BELL RANG THE PLAY HOUR WAS OVER IT WAS AN EVENING ON WHICH M
PELET WAS ACCUSTOMED TO READ PASSAGES FROM THE DRAMA AND THE BELLES
LETTRES TO HIS PUPILS
HE DID NOT WAIT FOR MY ANSWER BUT RISING LEFT
THE ROOM HUMMING AS HE WENT SOME GAY STRAIN OF BERANGER'S
CHAPTER XII
DAILY AS I CONTINUED MY ATTENDANCE AT THE SEMINARY OF MDLLE
REUTER
DID I FIND FRESH OCCASIONS TO COMPARE THE IDEAL WITH THE REAL
WHAT
HAD I KNOWN OF FEMALE CHARACTER PREVIOUSLY TO MY ARRIVAL AT BRUSSELS
PRECIOUS LITTLE
AND WHAT WAS MY NOTION OF IT SOMETHING VAGUE SLIGHT
GAUZY GLITTERING NOW WHEN I CAME IN CONTACT WITH IT I FOUND IT TO BE
A PALPABLE SUBSTANCE ENOUGH VERY HARD TOO SOMETIMES AND OFTEN HEAVY
THERE WAS METAL IN IT BOTH LEAD AND IRON
LET THE IDEALISTS THE DREAMERS ABOUT EARTHLY ANGEL AND HUMAN FLOWERS
JUST LOOK HERE WHILE I OPEN MY PORTFOLIO AND SHOW THEM A SKETCH OR
TWO PENCILLED AFTER NATURE
I TOOK THESE SKETCHES IN THE SECOND CLASS
SCHOOLROOM OF MDLLE
REUTER'S ESTABLISHMENT WHERE ABOUT A HUNDRED
SPECIMENS OF THE GENUS JEUNE FILLE COLLECTED TOGETHER OFFERED A
FERTILE VARIETY OF SUBJECT
A MISCELLANEOUS ASSORTMENT THEY WERE
DIFFERING BOTH IN CASTE AND COUNTRY AS I SAT ON MY ESTRADE AND GLANCED
OVER THE LONG RANGE OF DESKS I HAD UNDER MY EYE FRENCH ENGLISH
BELGIANS AUSTRIANS AND PRUSSIANS
THE MAJORITY BELONGED TO THE CLASS
BOURGEOIS BUT THERE WERE MANY COUNTESSES THERE WERE THE DAUGHTERS OF
TWO GENERALS AND OF SEVERAL COLONELS CAPTAINS AND GOVERNMENT EMPLOYES
THESE LADIES SAT SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOUNG FEMALES DESTINED TO BE
DEMOISELLES DE MAGASINS AND WITH SOME FLAMANDES GENUINE ABORIGINES OF
THE COUNTRY
IN DRESS ALL WERE NEARLY SIMILAR AND IN MANNERS THERE WAS
SMALL DIFFERENCE EXCEPTIONS THERE WERE TO THE GENERAL RULE BUT THE
MAJORITY GAVE THE TONE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THAT TONE WAS ROUGH
BOISTEROUS MASKED BY A POINT BLANK DISREGARD OF ALL FORBEARANCE TOWARDS
EACH OTHER OR THEIR TEACHERS AN EAGER PURSUIT BY EACH INDIVIDUAL OF HER
OWN INTEREST AND CONVENIENCE AND A COARSE INDIFFERENCE TO THE INTEREST
AND CONVENIENCE OF EVERY ONE ELSE
MOST OF THEM COULD LIE WITH AUDACITY
WHEN IT APPEARED ADVANTAGEOUS TO DO SO
ALL UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF
SPEAKING FAIR WHEN A POINT WAS TO BE GAINED AND COULD WITH CONSUMMATE
SKILL AND AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE TURN THE COLD SHOULDER THE INSTANT
CIVILITY CEASED TO BE PROFITABLE
VERY LITTLE OPEN QUARRELLING EVER TOOK
PLACE AMONGST THEM BUT BACKBITING AND TALEBEARING WERE UNIVERSAL
CLOSE
FRIENDSHIPS WERE FORBIDDEN BY THE RULES OF THE SCHOOL AND NO ONE GIRL
SEEMED TO CULTIVATE MORE REGARD FOR ANOTHER THAN WAS JUST NECESSARY TO
SECURE A COMPANION WHEN SOLITUDE WOULD HAVE BEEN IRKSOME
THEY WERE EACH
AND ALL SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN REARED IN UTTER UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF VICE
THE PRECAUTIONS USED TO KEEP THEM IGNORANT IF NOT INNOCENT WERE
INNUMERABLE
HOW WAS IT THEN THAT SCARCELY ONE OF THOSE GIRLS HAVING
ATTAINED THE AGE OF FOURTEEN COULD LOOK A MAN IN THE FACE WITH MODESTY
AND PROPRIETY AN AIR OF BOLD IMPUDENT FLIRTATION OR A LOOSE SILLY
LEER WAS SURE TO ANSWER THE MOST ORDINARY GLANCE FROM A MASCULINE EYE
I KNOW NOTHING OF THE ARCANA OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC RELIGION AND I
AM NOT A BIGOT IN MATTERS OF THEOLOGY BUT I SUSPECT THE ROOT OF THIS
PRECOCIOUS IMPURITY SO OBVIOUS SO GENERAL IN POPISH COUNTRIES IS TO
BE FOUND IN THE DISCIPLINE IF NOT THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH OF ROME
I RECORD WHAT I HAVE SEEN THESE GIRLS BELONGED TO WHAT ARE CALLED THE
RESPECTABLE RANKS OF SOCIETY THEY HAD ALL BEEN CAREFULLY BROUGHT UP
YET WAS THE MASS OF THEM MENTALLY DEPRAVED
SO MUCH FOR THE GENERAL
VIEW NOW FOR ONE OR TWO SELECTED SPECIMENS
THE FIRST PICTURE IS A FULL LENGTH OF AURELIA KOSLOW A GERMAN FRAULEIN
OR RATHER A HALF BREED BETWEEN GERMAN AND RUSSIAN
SHE IS EIGHTEEN YEARS
OF AGE AND HAS BEEN SENT TO BRUSSELS TO FINISH HER EDUCATION SHE IS
OF MIDDLE SIZE STIFFLY MADE BODY LONG LEGS SHORT BUST MUCH DEVELOPED
BUT NOT COMPACTLY MOULDED WAIST DISPROPORTIONATELY COMPRESSED BY AN
INHUMANLY BRACED CORSET DRESS CAREFULLY ARRANGED LARGE FEET TORTURED
INTO SMALL BOTTINES HEAD SMALL HAIR SMOOTHED BRAIDED OILED AND
GUMMED TO PERFECTION VERY LOW FOREHEAD VERY DIMINUTIVE AND VINDICTIVE
GREY EYES SOMEWHAT TARTAR FEATURES RATHER FLAT NOSE RATHER HIGH CHEEK
BONES YET THE ENSEMBLE NOT POSITIVELY UGLY TOLERABLY GOOD COMPLEXION
SO MUCH FOR PERSON
AS TO MIND DEPLORABLY IGNORANT AND ILL INFORMED
INCAPABLE OF WRITING OR SPEAKING CORRECTLY EVEN GERMAN HER NATIVE
TONGUE A DUNCE IN FRENCH AND HER ATTEMPTS AT LEARNING ENGLISH A MERE
FARCE YET SHE HAS BEEN AT SCHOOL TWELVE YEARS BUT AS SHE INVARIABLY
GETS HER EXERCISES OF EVERY DESCRIPTION DONE BY A FELLOW PUPIL AND
READS HER LESSONS OFF A BOOK CONCEALED IN HER LAP IT IS NOT WONDERFUL
THAT HER PROGRESS HAS BEEN SO SNAIL LIKE
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT AURELIA'S
DAILY HABITS OF LIFE ARE BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE OPPORTUNITY OF
OBSERVING HER AT ALL TIMES BUT FROM WHAT I SEE OF THE STATE OF HER
DESK BOOKS AND PAPERS I SHOULD SAY SHE IS SLOVENLY AND EVEN DIRTY
HER OUTWARD DRESS AS I HAVE SAID IS WELL ATTENDED TO BUT IN PASSING
BEHIND HER BENCH I HAVE REMARKED THAT HER NECK IS GRAY FOR WANT OF
WASHING AND HER HAIR SO GLOSSY WITH GUM AND GREASE IS NOT SUCH AS
ONE FEELS TEMPTED TO PASS THE HAND OVER MUCH LESS TO RUN THE FINGERS
THROUGH
AURELIA'S CONDUCT IN CLASS AT LEAST WHEN I AM PRESENT IS
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY CONSIDERED AS AN INDEX OF GIRLISH INNOCENCE
THE MOMENT I ENTER THE ROOM SHE NUDGES HER NEXT NEIGHBOUR AND INDULGES
IN A HALF SUPPRESSED LAUGH
AS I TAKE MY SEAT ON THE ESTRADE SHE
FIXES HER EYE ON ME SHE SEEMS RESOLVED TO ATTRACT AND IF POSSIBLE
MONOPOLIZE MY NOTICE TO THIS END SHE LAUNCHES AT ME ALL SORTS OF LOOKS
LANGUISHING PROVOKING LEERING LAUGHING
AS I AM FOUND QUITE PROOF
AGAINST THIS SORT OF ARTILLERY FOR WE SCORN WHAT UNASKED IS LAVISHLY
OFFERED SHE HAS RECOURSE TO THE EXPEDIENT OF MAKING NOISES SOMETIMES
SHE SIGHS SOMETIMES GROANS SOMETIMES UTTERS INARTICULATE SOUNDS FOR
WHICH LANGUAGE HAS NO NAME
IF IN WALKING UP THE SCHOOLROOM I PASS
NEAR HER SHE PUTS OUT HER FOOT THAT IT MAY TOUCH MINE IF I DO NOT
HAPPEN TO OBSERVE THE MANOEUVRE AND MY BOOT COMES IN CONTACT WITH HER
BRODEQUIN SHE AFFECTS TO FALL INTO CONVULSIONS OF SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER
IF I NOTICE THE SNARE AND AVOID IT SHE EXPRESSES HER MORTIFICATION IN
SULLEN MUTTERING WHERE I HEAR MYSELF ABUSED IN BAD FRENCH PRONOUNCED
WITH AN INTOLERABLE LOW GERMAN ACCENT
NOT FAR FROM MDLLE
KOSLOW SITS ANOTHER YOUNG LADY BY NAME ADELE
DRONSART THIS IS A BELGIAN RATHER LOW OF STATURE IN FORM HEAVY
WITH BROAD WAIST SHORT NECK AND LIMBS GOOD RED AND WHITE COMPLEXION
FEATURES WELL CHISELLED AND REGULAR WELL CUT EYES OF A CLEAR BROWN
COLOUR LIGHT BROWN HAIR GOOD TEETH AGE NOT MUCH ABOVE FIFTEEN BUT AS
FULL GROWN AS A STOUT YOUNG ENGLISHWOMAN OF TWENTY
THIS PORTRAIT GIVES
THE IDEA OF A SOMEWHAT DUMPY BUT GOOD LOOKING DAMSEL DOES IT NOT WELL
WHEN I LOOKED ALONG THE ROW OF YOUNG HEADS MY EYE GENERALLY STOPPED AT
THIS OF ADELE'S HER GAZE WAS EVER WAITING FOR MINE AND IT FREQUENTLY
SUCCEEDED IN ARRESTING IT
SHE WAS AN UNNATURAL LOOKING BEING SO YOUNG
FRESH BLOOMING YET SO GORGON LIKE
SUSPICION SULLEN ILL TEMPER WERE
ON HER FOREHEAD VICIOUS PROPENSITIES IN HER EYE ENVY AND PANTHER LIKE
DECEIT ABOUT HER MOUTH
IN GENERAL SHE SAT VERY STILL HER MASSIVE SHAPE
LOOKED AS IF IT COULD NOT BEND MUCH NOR DID HER LARGE HEAD SO BROAD
AT THE BASE SO NARROW TOWARDS THE TOP SEEM MADE TO TURN READILY ON HER
SHORT NECK
SHE HAD BUT TWO VARIETIES OF EXPRESSION THE PREVALENT ONE
A FORBIDDING DISSATISFIED SCOWL VARIED SOMETIMES BY A MOST PERNICIOUS
AND PERFIDIOUS SMILE
SHE WAS SHUNNED BY HER FELLOW PUPILS FOR BAD AS
MANY OF THEM WERE FEW WERE AS BAD AS SHE
AURELIA AND ADELE WERE IN THE FIRST DIVISION OF THE SECOND CLASS THE
SECOND DIVISION WAS HEADED BY A PENSIONNAIRE NAMED JUANNA TRISTA
THIS
GIRL WAS OF MIXED BELGIAN AND SPANISH ORIGIN HER FLEMISH MOTHER WAS
DEAD HER CATALONIAN FATHER WAS A MERCHANT RESIDING IN THE ISLES
WHERE JUANNA HAD BEEN BORN AND WHENCE SHE WAS SENT TO EUROPE TO BE
EDUCATED
I WONDER THAT ANY ONE LOOKING AT THAT GIRL'S HEAD AND
COUNTENANCE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED HER UNDER THEIR ROOF
SHE HAD PRECISELY
THE SAME SHAPE OF SKULL AS POPE ALEXANDER THE SIXTH HER ORGANS
OF BENEVOLENCE VENERATION CONSCIENTIOUSNESS ADHESIVENESS WERE
SINGULARLY SMALL THOSE OF SELF ESTEEM FIRMNESS DESTRUCTIVENESS
COMBATIVENESS PREPOSTEROUSLY LARGE HER HEAD SLOPED UP IN THE PENTHOUSE
SHAPE WAS CONTRACTED ABOUT THE FOREHEAD AND PROMINENT BEHIND SHE
HAD RATHER GOOD THOUGH LARGE AND MARKED FEATURES HER TEMPERAMENT WAS
FIBROUS AND BILIOUS HER COMPLEXION PALE AND DARK HAIR AND EYES BLACK
FORM ANGULAR AND RIGID BUT PROPORTIONATE AGE FIFTEEN
JUANNA WAS NOT VERY THIN BUT SHE HAD A GAUNT VISAGE AND HER REGARD
WAS FIERCE AND HUNGRY NARROW AS WAS HER BROW IT PRESENTED SPACE ENOUGH
FOR THE LEGIBLE GRAVING OF TWO WORDS MUTINY AND HATE IN SOME ONE OF
HER OTHER LINEAMENTS I THINK THE EYE COWARDICE HAD ALSO ITS DISTINCT
CIPHER
MDLLE
TRISTA THOUGHT FIT TO TROUBLE MY FIRST LESSONS WITH A
COARSE WORK DAY SORT OF TURBULENCE SHE MADE NOISES WITH HER MOUTH LIKE
A HORSE SHE EJECTED HER SALIVA SHE UTTERED BRUTAL EXPRESSIONS BEHIND
AND BELOW HER WERE SEATED A BAND OF VERY VULGAR INFERIOR LOOKING
FLAMANDES INCLUDING TWO OR THREE EXAMPLES OF THAT DEFORMITY OF PERSON
AND IMBECILITY OF INTELLECT WHOSE FREQUENCY IN THE LOW COUNTRIES WOULD
SEEM TO FURNISH PROOF THAT THE CLIMATE IS SUCH AS TO INDUCE DEGENERACY
OF THE HUMAN MIND AND BODY THESE I SOON FOUND WERE COMPLETELY UNDER
HER INFLUENCE AND WITH THEIR AID SHE GOT UP AND SUSTAINED A SWINISH
TUMULT WHICH I WAS CONSTRAINED AT LAST TO QUELL BY ORDERING HER AND TWO
OF HER TOOLS TO RISE FROM THEIR SEATS AND HAVING KEPT THEM STANDING
FIVE MINUTES TURNING THEM BODILY OUT OF THE SCHOOLROOM THE ACCOMPLICES
INTO A LARGE PLACE ADJOINING CALLED THE GRANDS SALLE THE PRINCIPAL
INTO A CABINET OF WHICH I CLOSED THE DOOR AND POCKETED THE KEY
THIS
JUDGMENT I EXECUTED IN THE PRESENCE OF MDLLE
REUTER WHO LOOKED MUCH
AGHAST AT BEHOLDING SO DECIDED A PROCEEDING THE MOST SEVERE THAT HAD
EVER BEEN VENTURED ON IN HER ESTABLISHMENT
HER LOOK OF AFFRIGHT I
ANSWERED WITH ONE OF COMPOSURE AND FINALLY WITH A SMILE WHICH PERHAPS
FLATTERED AND CERTAINLY SOOTHED HER
JUANNA TRISTA REMAINED IN EUROPE
LONG ENOUGH TO REPAY BY MALEVOLENCE AND INGRATITUDE ALL WHO HAD EVER
DONE HER A GOOD TURN AND SHE THEN WENT TO JOIN HER FATHER IN THE
ISLES EXULTING IN THE THOUGHT THAT SHE SHOULD THERE HAVE SLAVES WHOM
AS SHE SAID SHE COULD KICK AND STRIKE AT WILL
THESE THREE PICTURES ARE FROM THE LIFE
I POSSESS OTHERS AS MARKED AND
AS LITTLE AGREEABLE BUT I WILL SPARE MY READER THE EXHIBITION OF THEM
DOUBTLESS IT WILL BE THOUGHT THAT I OUGHT NOW BY WAY OF CONTRAST TO
SHOW SOMETHING CHARMING SOME GENTLE VIRGIN HEAD CIRCLED WITH A HALO
SOME SWEET PERSONIFICATION OF INNOCENCE CLASPING THE DOVE OF PEACE TO
HER BOSOM
NO I SAW NOTHING OF THE SORT AND THEREFORE CANNOT PORTRAY
IT
THE PUPIL IN THE SCHOOL POSSESSING THE HAPPIEST DISPOSITION WAS
A YOUNG GIRL FROM THE COUNTRY LOUISE PATH SHE WAS SUFFICIENTLY
BENEVOLENT AND OBLIGING BUT NOT WELL TAUGHT NOR WELL MANNERED
MOREOVER THE PLAGUE SPOT OF DISSIMULATION WAS IN HER ALSO HONOUR AND
PRINCIPLE WERE UNKNOWN TO HER SHE HAD SCARCELY HEARD THEIR NAMES
THE
LEAST EXCEPTIONABLE PUPIL WAS THE POOR LITTLE SYLVIE I HAVE MENTIONED
ONCE BEFORE
SYLVIE WAS GENTLE IN MANNERS INTELLIGENT IN MIND SHE WAS
EVEN SINCERE AS FAR AS HER RELIGION WOULD PERMIT HER TO BE SO BUT HER
PHYSICAL ORGANIZATION WAS DEFECTIVE WEAK HEALTH STUNTED HER GROWTH AND
CHILLED HER SPIRITS AND THEN DESTINED AS SHE WAS FOR THE CLOISTER
HER WHOLE SOUL WAS WARPED TO A CONVENTUAL BIAS AND IN THE TAME TRAINED
SUBJECTION OF HER MANNER ONE READ THAT SHE HAD ALREADY PREPARED HERSELF
FOR HER FUTURE COURSE OF LIFE BY GIVING UP HER INDEPENDENCE OF THOUGHT
AND ACTION INTO THE HANDS OF SOME DESPOTIC CONFESSOR
SHE PERMITTED
HERSELF NO ORIGINAL OPINION NO PREFERENCE OF COMPANION OR EMPLOYMENT
IN EVERYTHING SHE WAS GUIDED BY ANOTHER
WITH A PALE PASSIVE AUTOMATON
AIR SHE WENT ABOUT ALL DAY LONG DOING WHAT SHE WAS BID NEVER WHAT SHE
LIKED OR WHAT FROM INNATE CONVICTION SHE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO DO
THE
POOR LITTLE FUTURE RELIGIEUSE HAD BEEN EARLY TAUGHT TO MAKE THE DICTATES
OF HER OWN REASON AND CONSCIENCE QUITE SUBORDINATE TO THE WILL OF
HER SPIRITUAL DIRECTOR
SHE WAS THE MODEL PUPIL OF MDLLE
REUTER'S
ESTABLISHMENT PALE BLIGHTED IMAGE WHERE LIFE LINGERED FEEBLY BUT
WHENCE THE SOUL HAD BEEN CONJURED BY ROMISH WIZARD CRAFT
A FEW ENGLISH PUPILS THERE WERE IN THIS SCHOOL AND THESE MIGHT BE
DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES
1ST
THE CONTINENTAL ENGLISH THE DAUGHTERS
CHIEFLY OF BROKEN ADVENTURERS WHOM DEBT OR DISHONOUR HAD DRIVEN FROM
THEIR OWN COUNTRY
THESE POOR GIRLS HAD NEVER KNOWN THE ADVANTAGES
OF SETTLED HOMES DECOROUS EXAMPLE OR HONEST PROTESTANT EDUCATION
RESIDENT A FEW MONTHS NOW IN ONE CATHOLIC SCHOOL NOW IN ANOTHER AS
THEIR PARENTS WANDERED FROM LAND TO LAND FROM FRANCE TO GERMANY FROM
GERMANY TO BELGIUM THEY HAD PICKED UP SOME SCANTY INSTRUCTION MANY BAD
HABITS LOSING EVERY NOTION EVEN OF THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF RELIGION AND
MORALS AND ACQUIRING AN IMBECILE INDIFFERENCE TO EVERY SENTIMENT THAT
CAN ELEVATE HUMANITY THEY WERE DISTINGUISHABLE BY AN HABITUAL LOOK
OF SULLEN DEJECTION THE RESULT OF CRUSHED SELF RESPECT AND CONSTANT
BROWBEATING FROM THEIR POPISH FELLOW PUPILS WHO HATED THEM AS ENGLISH
AND SCORNED THEM AS HERETICS
THE SECOND CLASS WERE BRITISH ENGLISH
OF THESE I DID NOT ENCOUNTER HALF
A DOZEN DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF MY ATTENDANCE AT THE SEMINARY THEIR
CHARACTERISTICS WERE CLEAN BUT CARELESS DRESS ILL ARRANGED HAIR
COMPARED WITH THE TIGHT AND TRIM FOREIGNERS ERECT CARRIAGE FLEXIBLE
FIGURES WHITE AND TAPER HANDS FEATURES MORE IRREGULAR BUT ALSO MORE
INTELLECTUAL THAN THOSE OF THE BELGIANS GRAVE AND MODEST COUNTENANCES
A GENERAL AIR OF NATIVE PROPRIETY AND DECENCY BY THIS LAST CIRCUMSTANCE
ALONE I COULD AT A GLANCE DISTINGUISH THE DAUGHTER OF ALBION AND
NURSLING OF PROTESTANTISM FROM THE FOSTER CHILD OF ROME THE PROTEGEE
OF JESUISTRY PROUD TOO WAS THE ASPECT OF THESE BRITISH GIRLS AT ONCE
ENVIED AND RIDICULED BY THEIR CONTINENTAL ASSOCIATES THEY WARDED OFF
INSULT WITH AUSTERE CIVILITY AND MET HATE WITH MUTE DISDAIN THEY
ESCHEWED COMPANY KEEPING AND IN THE MIDST OF NUMBERS SEEMED TO DWELL
ISOLATED
THE TEACHERS PRESIDING OVER THIS MIXED MULTITUDE WERE THREE IN NUMBER
ALL FRENCH THEIR NAMES MDLLES
ZEPHYRINE PELAGIE AND SUZETTE THE TWO
LAST WERE COMMONPLACE PERSONAGES ENOUGH THEIR LOOK WAS ORDINARY
THEIR MANNER WAS ORDINARY THEIR TEMPER WAS ORDINARY THEIR THOUGHTS
FEELINGS AND VIEWS WERE ALL ORDINARY WERE I TO WRITE A CHAPTER ON THE
SUBJECT I COULD NOT ELUCIDATE IT FURTHER
ZEPHYRINE WAS SOMEWHAT MORE
DISTINGUISHED IN APPEARANCE AND DEPORTMENT THAN PELAGIE AND SUZETTE
BUT IN CHARACTER GENUINE PARISIAN COQUETTE PERFIDIOUS MERCENARY AND
DRY HEARTED
A FOURTH MAITRESSE I SOMETIMES SAW WHO SEEMED TO COME DAILY
TO TEACH NEEDLEWORK OR NETTING OR LACE MENDING OR SOME SUCH FLIMSY
ART BUT OF HER I NEVER HAD MORE THAN A PASSING GLIMPSE AS SHE SAT IN
THE CARRE WITH HER FRAMES AND SOME DOZEN OF THE ELDER PUPILS ABOUT HER
CONSEQUENTLY I HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF STUDYING HER CHARACTER OR EVEN OF
OBSERVING HER PERSON MUCH THE LATTER I REMARKED HAD A VERY ENGLISH
AIR FOR A MAITRESSE OTHERWISE IT WAS NOT STRIKING OF CHARACTER I
SHOULD THINK SHE POSSESSED BUT LITTLE AS HER PUPILS SEEMED CONSTANTLY
EN REVOLTE AGAINST HER AUTHORITY
SHE DID NOT RESIDE IN THE HOUSE HER
NAME I THINK WAS MDLLE
HENRI
AMIDST THIS ASSEMBLAGE OF ALL THAT WAS INSIGNIFICANT AND DEFECTIVE MUCH
THAT WAS VICIOUS AND REPULSIVE BY THAT LAST EPITHET MANY WOULD HAVE
DESCRIBED THE TWO OR THREE STIFF SILENT DECENTLY BEHAVED ILL DRESSED
BRITISH GIRLS THE SENSIBLE SAGACIOUS AFFABLE DIRECTRESS SHONE LIKE A
STEADY STAR OVER A MARSH FULL OF JACK O' LANTHORNS PROFOUNDLY AWARE
OF HER SUPERIORITY SHE DERIVED AN INWARD BLISS FROM THAT CONSCIOUSNESS
WHICH SUSTAINED HER UNDER ALL THE CARE AND RESPONSIBILITY INSEPARABLE
FROM HER POSITION IT KEPT HER TEMPER CALM HER BROW SMOOTH HER MANNER
TRANQUIL
SHE LIKED AS WHO WOULD NOT ON ENTERING THE SCHOOL ROOM
TO FEEL THAT HER SOLE PRESENCE SUFFICED TO DIFFUSE THAT ORDER AND
QUIET WHICH ALL THE REMONSTRANCES AND EVEN COMMANDS OF HER UNDERLINGS
FREQUENTLY FAILED TO ENFORCE SHE LIKED TO STAND IN COMPARISON OR
RATHER CONTRAST WITH THOSE WHO SURROUNDED HER AND TO KNOW THAT IN
PERSONAL AS WELL AS MENTAL ADVANTAGES SHE BORE AWAY THE UNDISPUTED
PALM OF PREFERENCE THE THREE TEACHERS WERE ALL PLAIN HER PUPILS SHE
MANAGED WITH SUCH INDULGENCE AND ADDRESS TAKING ALWAYS ON HERSELF THE
OFFICE OF RECOMPENSER AND EULOGIST AND ABANDONING TO HER SUBALTERNS
EVERY INVIDIOUS TASK OF BLAME AND PUNISHMENT THAT THEY ALL REGARDED HER
WITH DEFERENCE IF NOT WITH AFFECTION HER TEACHERS DID NOT LOVE HER
BUT THEY SUBMITTED BECAUSE THEY WERE HER INFERIORS IN EVERYTHING THE
VARIOUS MASTERS WHO ATTENDED HER SCHOOL WERE EACH AND ALL IN SOME WAY
OR OTHER UNDER HER INFLUENCE OVER ONE SHE HAD ACQUIRED POWER BY HER
SKILFUL MANAGEMENT OF HIS BAD TEMPER OVER ANOTHER BY LITTLE ATTENTIONS
TO HIS PETTY CAPRICES A THIRD SHE HAD SUBDUED BY FLATTERY A FOURTH A
TIMID MAN SHE KEPT IN AWE BY A SORT OF AUSTERE DECISION OF MIEN ME
SHE STILL WATCHED STILL TRIED BY THE MOST INGENIOUS TESTS SHE ROVED
ROUND ME BAFFLED YET PERSEVERING I BELIEVE SHE THOUGHT I WAS LIKE
A SMOOTH AND BARE PRECIPICE WHICH OFFERED NEITHER JUTTING STONE NOR
TREE ROOT NOR TUFT OF GRASS TO AID THE CLIMBER
NOW SHE FLATTERED
WITH EXQUISITE TACT NOW SHE MORALIZED NOW SHE TRIED HOW FAR I WAS
ACCESSIBLE TO MERCENARY MOTIVES THEN SHE DISPORTED ON THE BRINK OF
AFFECTION KNOWING THAT SOME MEN ARE WON BY WEAKNESS ANON SHE TALKED
EXCELLENT SENSE AWARE THAT OTHERS HAVE THE FOLLY TO ADMIRE JUDGMENT
I FOUND IT AT ONCE PLEASANT AND EASY TO EVADE ALL THESE EFFORTS IT WAS
SWEET WHEN SHE THOUGHT ME NEARLY WON TO TURN ROUND AND TO SMILE IN
HER VERY EYES HALF SCORNFULLY AND THEN TO WITNESS HER SCARCELY VEILED
THOUGH MUTE MORTIFICATION
STILL SHE PERSEVERED AND AT LAST I AM BOUND
TO CONFESS IT HER FINGER ESSAYING PROVING EVERY ATOM OF THE CASKET
TOUCHED ITS SECRET SPRING AND FOR A MOMENT THE LID SPRUNG OPEN SHE
LAID HER HAND ON THE JEWEL WITHIN WHETHER SHE STOLE AND BROKE IT OR
WHETHER THE LID SHUT AGAIN WITH A SNAP ON HER FINGERS READ ON AND YOU
SHALL KNOW
IT HAPPENED THAT I CAME ONE DAY TO GIVE A LESSON WHEN I WAS INDISPOSED
I HAD A BAD COLD AND A COUGH TWO HOURS' INCESSANT TALKING LEFT ME VERY
HOARSE AND TIRED AS I QUITTED THE SCHOOLROOM AND WAS PASSING ALONG THE
CORRIDOR I MET MDLLE
REUTER SHE REMARKED WITH AN ANXIOUS AIR THAT
I LOOKED VERY PALE AND TIRED
YES I SAID I WAS FATIGUED AND THEN
WITH INCREASED INTEREST SHE REJOINED YOU SHALL NOT GO AWAY TILL YOU
HAVE HAD SOME REFRESHMENT SHE PERSUADED ME TO STEP INTO THE PARLOUR
AND WAS VERY KIND AND GENTLE WHILE I STAYED
THE NEXT DAY SHE WAS KINDER
STILL SHE CAME HERSELF INTO THE CLASS TO SEE THAT THE WINDOWS WERE
CLOSED AND THAT THERE WAS NO DRAUGHT SHE EXHORTED ME WITH FRIENDLY
EARNESTNESS NOT TO OVER EXERT MYSELF WHEN I WENT AWAY SHE GAVE ME
HER HAND UNASKED AND I COULD NOT BUT MARK BY A RESPECTFUL AND GENTLE
PRESSURE THAT I WAS SENSIBLE OF THE FAVOUR AND GRATEFUL FOR IT
MY
MODEST DEMONSTRATION KINDLED A LITTLE MERRY SMILE ON HER COUNTENANCE
I THOUGHT HER ALMOST CHARMING
DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING MY
MIND WAS FULL OF IMPATIENCE FOR THE AFTERNOON OF THE NEXT DAY TO ARRIVE
THAT I MIGHT SEE HER AGAIN
I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED FOR SHE SAT IN THE CLASS DURING THE WHOLE OF MY
SUBSEQUENT LESSON AND OFTEN LOOKED AT ME ALMOST WITH AFFECTION
AT FOUR
O'CLOCK SHE ACCOMPANIED ME OUT OF THE SCHOOLROOM ASKING WITH SOLICITUDE
AFTER MY HEALTH THEN SCOLDING ME SWEETLY BECAUSE I SPOKE TOO LOUD AND
GAVE MYSELF TOO MUCH TROUBLE I STOPPED AT THE GLASS DOOR WHICH LED INTO
THE GARDEN TO HEAR HER LECTURE TO THE END THE DOOR WAS OPEN IT WAS A
VERY FINE DAY AND WHILE I LISTENED TO THE SOOTHING REPRIMAND I LOOKED
AT THE SUNSHINE AND FLOWERS AND FELT VERY HAPPY
THE DAY SCHOLARS BEGAN
TO POUR FROM THE SCHOOLROOMS INTO THE PASSAGE
WILL YOU GO INTO THE GARDEN A MINUTE OR TWO ASKED SHE TILL THEY ARE
GONE
I DESCENDED THE STEPS WITHOUT ANSWERING BUT I LOOKED BACK AS MUCH AS TO
SAY
YOU WILL COME WITH ME
IN ANOTHER MINUTE I AND THE DIRECTRESS WERE WALKING SIDE BY SIDE DOWN
THE ALLEY BORDERED WITH FRUIT TREES WHOSE WHITE BLOSSOMS WERE THEN IN
FULL BLOW AS WELL AS THEIR TENDER GREEN LEAVES
THE SKY WAS BLUE THE
AIR STILL THE MAY AFTERNOON WAS FULL OF BRIGHTNESS AND FRAGRANCE
RELEASED FROM THE STIFLING CLASS SURROUNDED WITH FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE
WITH A PLEASING SMILING AFFABLE WOMAN AT MY SIDE HOW DID I FEEL WHY
VERY ENVIABLY
IT SEEMED AS IF THE ROMANTIC VISIONS MY IMAGINATION HAD
SUGGESTED OF THIS GARDEN WHILE IT WAS YET HIDDEN FROM ME BY THE JEALOUS
BOARDS WERE MORE THAN REALIZED AND WHEN A TURN IN THE ALLEY SHUT OUT
THE VIEW OF THE HOUSE AND SOME TALL SHRUBS EXCLUDED M
PELET'S
MANSION AND SCREENED US MOMENTARILY FROM THE OTHER HOUSES RISING
AMPHITHEATRE LIKE ROUND THIS GREEN SPOT I GAVE MY ARM TO MDLLE
REUTER
AND LED HER TO A GARDEN CHAIR NESTLED UNDER SOME LILACS NEAR
SHE SAT
DOWN I TOOK MY PLACE AT HER SIDE
SHE WENT ON TALKING TO ME WITH THAT
EASE WHICH COMMUNICATES EASE AND AS I LISTENED A REVELATION DAWNED
IN MY MIND THAT I WAS ON THE BRINK OF FALLING IN LOVE
THE DINNER BELL
RANG BOTH AT HER HOUSE AND M
PELET'S WE WERE OBLIGED TO PART I
DETAINED HER A MOMENT AS SHE WAS MOVING AWAY
I WANT SOMETHING SAID I
WHAT ASKED ZORAIDE NAIVELY
ONLY A FLOWER
GATHER IT THEN OR TWO OR TWENTY IF YOU LIKE
NO ONE WILL DO BUT YOU MUST GATHER IT AND GIVE IT TO ME
WHAT A CAPRICE SHE EXCLAIMED BUT SHE RAISED HERSELF ON HER TIP TOES
AND PLUCKING A BEAUTIFUL BRANCH OF LILAC OFFERED IT TO ME WITH GRACE
I TOOK IT AND WENT AWAY SATISFIED FOR THE PRESENT AND HOPEFUL FOR THE
FUTURE
CERTAINLY THAT MAY DAY WAS A LOVELY ONE AND IT CLOSED IN MOONLIGHT
NIGHT OF SUMMER WARMTH AND SERENITY
I REMEMBER THIS WELL FOR HAVING
SAT UP LATE THAT EVENING CORRECTING DEVOIRS AND FEELING WEARY AND
A LITTLE OPPRESSED WITH THE CLOSENESS OF MY SMALL ROOM I OPENED THE
OFTEN MENTIONED BOARDED WINDOW WHOSE BOARDS HOWEVER I HAD PERSUADED
OLD MADAME PELET TO HAVE REMOVED SINCE I HAD FILLED THE POST OF
PROFESSOR IN THE PENSIONNAT DE DEMOISELLES AS FROM THAT TIME IT
WAS NO LONGER INCONVENIENT FOR ME TO OVERLOOK MY OWN PUPILS AT THEIR
SPORTS
I SAT DOWN IN THE WINDOW SEAT RESTED MY ARM ON THE SILL
AND LEANED OUT ABOVE ME WAS THE CLEAR OBSCURE OF A CLOUDLESS
NIGHT SKY SPLENDID MOONLIGHT SUBDUED THE TREMULOUS SPARKLE OF THE
STARS BELOW LAY THE GARDEN VARIED WITH SILVERY LUSTRE AND DEEP SHADE
AND ALL FRESH WITH DEW A GRATEFUL PERFUME EXHALED FROM THE CLOSED
BLOSSOMS OF THE FRUIT TREES NOT A LEAF STIRRED THE NIGHT WAS
BREEZELESS
MY WINDOW LOOKED DIRECTLY DOWN UPON A CERTAIN WALK OF MDLLE
REUTER'S GARDEN CALLED L'ALLEE DEFENDUE SO NAMED BECAUSE THE PUPILS
WERE FORBIDDEN TO ENTER IT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS PROXIMITY TO THE BOYS'
SCHOOL
IT WAS HERE THAT THE LILACS AND LABURNUMS GREW ESPECIALLY THICK
THIS WAS THE MOST SHELTERED NOOK IN THE ENCLOSURE ITS SHRUBS SCREENED
THE GARDEN CHAIR WHERE THAT AFTERNOON I HAD SAT WITH THE YOUNG
DIRECTRESS
I NEED NOT SAY THAT MY THOUGHTS WERE CHIEFLY WITH HER AS
I LEANED FROM THE LATTICE AND LET MY EYE ROAM NOW OVER THE WALKS AND
BORDERS OF THE GARDEN NOW ALONG THE MANY WINDOWED FRONT OF THE HOUSE
WHICH ROSE WHITE BEYOND THE MASSES OF FOLIAGE
I WONDERED IN WHAT PART
OF THE BUILDING WAS SITUATED HER APARTMENT AND A SINGLE LIGHT SHINING
THROUGH THE PERSIENNES OF ONE CROISEE SEEMED TO DIRECT ME TO IT
SHE WATCHES LATE THOUGHT I FOR IT MUST BE NOW NEAR MIDNIGHT
SHE
IS A FASCINATING LITTLE WOMAN I CONTINUED IN VOICELESS SOLILOQUY HER
IMAGE FORMS A PLEASANT PICTURE IN MEMORY I KNOW SHE IS NOT WHAT THE
WORLD CALLS PRETTY NO MATTER THERE IS HARMONY IN HER ASPECT AND I
LIKE IT HER BROWN HAIR HER BLUE EYE THE FRESHNESS OF HER CHEEK THE
WHITENESS OF HER NECK ALL SUIT MY TASTE
THEN I RESPECT HER TALENT
THE IDEA OF MARRYING A DOLL OR A FOOL WAS ALWAYS ABHORRENT TO ME I KNOW
THAT A PRETTY DOLL A FAIR FOOL MIGHT DO WELL ENOUGH FOR THE HONEYMOON
BUT WHEN PASSION COOLED HOW DREADFUL TO FIND A LUMP OF WAX AND WOOD
LAID IN MY BOSOM A HALF IDIOT CLASPED IN MY ARMS AND TO REMEMBER THAT
I HAD MADE OF THIS MY EQUAL NAY MY IDOL TO KNOW THAT I MUST PASS THE
REST OF MY DREARY LIFE WITH A CREATURE INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT
I SAID OF APPRECIATING WHAT I THOUGHT OR OF SYMPATHIZING WITH WHAT I
FELT NOW ZORAIDE REUTER THOUGHT I HAS TACT CARACTERE JUDGMENT
DISCRETION HAS SHE HEART WHAT A GOOD SIMPLE LITTLE SMILE PLAYED
ABOUT HER LIPS WHEN SHE GAVE ME THE BRANCH OF LILACS I HAVE THOUGHT HER
CRAFTY DISSEMBLING INTERESTED SOMETIMES IT IS TRUE BUT MAY NOT MUCH
THAT LOOKS LIKE CUNNING AND DISSIMULATION IN HER CONDUCT BE ONLY
THE EFFORTS MADE BY A BLAND TEMPER TO TRAVERSE QUIETLY PERPLEXING
DIFFICULTIES AND AS TO INTEREST SHE WISHES TO MAKE HER WAY IN THE
WORLD NO DOUBT AND WHO CAN BLAME HER EVEN IF SHE BE TRULY DEFICIENT
IN SOUND PRINCIPLE IS IT NOT RATHER HER MISFORTUNE THAN HER FAULT SHE
HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP A CATHOLIC HAD SHE BEEN BORN AN ENGLISHWOMAN AND
REARED A PROTESTANT MIGHT SHE NOT HAVE ADDED STRAIGHT INTEGRITY TO
ALL HER OTHER EXCELLENCES SUPPOSING SHE WERE TO MARRY AN ENGLISH AND
PROTESTANT HUSBAND WOULD SHE NOT RATIONAL SENSIBLE AS SHE IS QUICKLY
ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPERIORITY OF RIGHT OVER EXPEDIENCY HONESTY OVER
POLICY IT WOULD BE WORTH A MAN'S WHILE TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT TO MORROW
I WILL RENEW MY OBSERVATIONS
SHE KNOWS THAT I WATCH HER HOW CALM SHE
IS UNDER SCRUTINY IT SEEMS RATHER TO GRATIFY THAN ANNOY HER HERE A
STRAIN OF MUSIC STOLE IN UPON MY MONOLOGUE AND SUSPENDED IT IT WAS
A BUGLE VERY SKILFULLY PLAYED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE PARK I
THOUGHT OR ON THE PLACE ROYALE
SO SWEET WERE THE TONES SO SUBDUING
THEIR EFFECT AT THAT HOUR IN THE MIDST OF SILENCE AND UNDER THE
QUIET REIGN OF MOONLIGHT I CEASED TO THINK THAT I MIGHT LISTEN MORE
INTENTLY
THE STRAIN RETREATED ITS SOUND WAXED FAINTER AND WAS SOON
GONE MY EAR PREPARED TO REPOSE ON THE ABSOLUTE HUSH OF MIDNIGHT ONCE
MORE
NO
WHAT MURMUR WAS THAT WHICH LOW AND YET NEAR AND APPROACHING
NEARER FRUSTRATED THE EXPECTATION OF TOTAL SILENCE IT WAS SOME ONE
CONVERSING YES EVIDENTLY AN AUDIBLE THOUGH SUBDUED VOICE SPOKE IN
THE GARDEN IMMEDIATELY BELOW ME
ANOTHER ANSWERED THE FIRST VOICE WAS
THAT OF A MAN THE SECOND THAT OF A WOMAN AND A MAN AND A WOMAN I SAW
COMING SLOWLY DOWN THE ALLEY
THEIR FORMS WERE AT FIRST IN SHADE I
COULD BUT DISCERN A DUSK OUTLINE OF EACH BUT A RAY OF MOONLIGHT MET
THEM AT THE TERMINATION OF THE WALK WHEN THEY WERE UNDER MY VERY NOSE
AND REVEALED VERY PLAINLY VERY UNEQUIVOCALLY MDLLE
ZORAIDE REUTER
ARM IN ARM OR HAND IN HAND I FORGET WHICH WITH MY PRINCIPAL
CONFIDANT AND COUNSELLOR M
FRANCOIS PELET
AND M
PELET WAS SAYING
A QUAND DONC LE JOUR DES NOCES MA BIEN AIMEE
AND MDLLE
REUTER ANSWERED
MAIS FRANCOIS TU SAIS BIEN QU'IL ME SERAIT IMPOSSIBLE DE ME MARIER
AVANT LES VACANCES
JUNE JULY AUGUST A WHOLE QUARTER EXCLAIMED THE DIRECTOR
HOW CAN
I WAIT SO LONG I WHO AM READY EVEN NOW TO EXPIRE AT YOUR FEET WITH
IMPATIENCE
AH IF YOU DIE THE WHOLE AFFAIR WILL BE SETTLED WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
ABOUT NOTARIES AND CONTRACTS I SHALL ONLY HAVE TO ORDER A SLIGHT
MOURNING DRESS WHICH WILL BE MUCH SOONER PREPARED THAN THE NUPTIAL
TROUSSEAU
CRUEL ZORAIDE YOU LAUGH AT THE DISTRESS OF ONE WHO LOVES YOU SO
DEVOTEDLY AS I DO MY TORMENT IS YOUR SPORT YOU SCRUPLE NOT TO STRETCH
MY SOUL ON THE RACK OF JEALOUSY FOR DENY IT AS YOU WILL I AM CERTAIN
YOU HAVE CAST ENCOURAGING GLANCES ON THAT SCHOOL BOY CRIMSWORTH HE HAS
PRESUMED TO FALL IN LOVE WHICH HE DARED NOT HAVE DONE UNLESS YOU HAD
GIVEN HIM ROOM TO HOPE
WHAT DO YOU SAY FRANCOIS DO YOU SAY CRIMSWORTH IS IN LOVE WITH ME
OVER HEAD AND EARS
HAS HE TOLD YOU SO
NO BUT I SEE IT IN HIS FACE HE BLUSHES WHENEVER YOUR NAME IS
MENTIONED A LITTLE LAUGH OF EXULTING COQUETRY ANNOUNCED MDLLE
REUTER'S GRATIFICATION AT THIS PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH WAS A LIE
BY THE BY I HAD NEVER BEEN SO FAR GONE AS THAT AFTER ALL
M
PELET
PROCEEDED TO ASK WHAT SHE INTENDED TO DO WITH ME INTIMATING PRETTY
PLAINLY AND NOT VERY GALLANTLY THAT IT WAS NONSENSE FOR HER TO THINK
OF TAKING SUCH A BLANC BEC AS A HUSBAND SINCE SHE MUST BE AT LEAST
TEN YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS SHE THEN THIRTY TWO I SHOULD NOT HAVE
THOUGHT IT
I HEARD HER DISCLAIM ANY INTENTIONS ON THE SUBJECT THE
DIRECTOR HOWEVER STILL PRESSED HER TO GIVE A DEFINITE ANSWER
FRANCOIS SAID SHE YOU ARE JEALOUS AND STILL SHE LAUGHED THEN AS
IF SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING THAT THIS COQUETRY WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE
CHARACTER FOR MODEST DIGNITY SHE WISHED TO ESTABLISH SHE PROCEEDED
IN A DEMURE VOICE TRULY MY DEAR FRANCOIS I WILL NOT DENY THAT THIS
YOUNG ENGLISHMAN MAY HAVE MADE SOME ATTEMPTS TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH
ME BUT SO FAR FROM GIVING HIM ANY ENCOURAGEMENT I HAVE ALWAYS TREATED
HIM WITH AS MUCH RESERVE AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO COMBINE WITH CIVILITY
AFFIANCED AS I AM TO YOU I WOULD GIVE NO MAN FALSE HOPES BELIEVE ME
DEAR FRIEND STILL PELET UTTERED MURMURS OF DISTRUST SO I JUDGED AT
LEAST FROM HER REPLY
WHAT FOLLY HOW COULD I PREFER AN UNKNOWN FOREIGNER TO YOU AND
THEN NOT TO FLATTER YOUR VANITY CRIMSWORTH COULD NOT BEAR COMPARISON
WITH YOU EITHER PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY HE IS NOT A HANDSOME MAN AT ALL
SOME MAY CALL HIM GENTLEMAN LIKE AND INTELLIGENT LOOKING BUT FOR MY
PART
THE REST OF THE SENTENCE WAS LOST IN THE DISTANCE AS THE PAIR RISING
FROM THE CHAIR IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SEATED MOVED AWAY
I WAITED THEIR
RETURN BUT SOON THE OPENING AND SHUTTING OF A DOOR INFORMED ME THAT
THEY HAD RE ENTERED THE HOUSE I LISTENED A LITTLE LONGER ALL WAS
PERFECTLY STILL I LISTENED MORE THAN AN HOUR AT LAST I HEARD M
PELET
COME IN AND ASCEND TO HIS CHAMBER
GLANCING ONCE MORE TOWARDS THE LONG
FRONT OF THE GARDEN HOUSE I PERCEIVED THAT ITS SOLITARY LIGHT WAS
AT LENGTH EXTINGUISHED SO FOR A TIME WAS MY FAITH IN LOVE AND
FRIENDSHIP
I WENT TO BED BUT SOMETHING FEVERISH AND FIERY HAD GOT INTO
MY VEINS WHICH PREVENTED ME FROM SLEEPING MUCH THAT NIGHT
CHAPTER XIII
NEXT MORNING I ROSE WITH THE DAWN AND HAVING DRESSED MYSELF AND STOOD
HALF AN HOUR MY ELBOW LEANING ON THE CHEST OF DRAWERS CONSIDERING WHAT
MEANS I SHOULD ADOPT TO RESTORE MY SPIRITS FAGGED WITH SLEEPLESSNESS
TO THEIR ORDINARY TONE FOR I HAD NO INTENTION OF GETTING UP A SCENE
WITH M
PELET REPROACHING HIM WITH PERFIDY SENDING HIM A CHALLENGE OR
PERFORMING OTHER GAMBADOES OF THE SORT I HIT AT LAST ON THE
EXPEDIENT OF WALKING OUT IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING TO A NEIGHBOURING
ESTABLISHMENT OF BATHS AND TREATING MYSELF TO A BRACING PLUNGE
THE REMEDY PRODUCED THE DESIRED EFFECT
I CAME BACK AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
STEADIED AND INVIGORATED AND WAS ABLE TO GREET M
PELET WHEN HE
ENTERED TO BREAKFAST WITH AN UNCHANGED AND TRANQUIL COUNTENANCE EVEN
A CORDIAL OFFERING OF THE HAND AND THE FLATTERING APPELLATION OF MON
FILS PRONOUNCED IN THAT CARESSING TONE WITH WHICH MONSIEUR HAD OF
LATE DAYS ESPECIALLY BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO ADDRESS ME DID NOT ELICIT ANY
EXTERNAL SIGN OF THE FEELING WHICH THOUGH SUBDUED STILL GLOWED AT
MY HEART
NOT THAT I NURSED VENGEANCE NO BUT THE SENSE OF INSULT AND
TREACHERY LIVED IN ME LIKE A KINDLING THOUGH AS YET SMOTHERED COAL
GOD
KNOWS I AM NOT BY NATURE VINDICTIVE I WOULD NOT HURT A MAN BECAUSE I
CAN NO LONGER TRUST OR LIKE HIM BUT NEITHER MY REASON NOR FEELINGS
ARE OF THE VACILLATING ORDER THEY ARE NOT OF THAT SAND LIKE SORT WHERE
IMPRESSIONS IF SOON MADE ARE AS SOON EFFACED
ONCE CONVINCED THAT MY
FRIEND'S DISPOSITION IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH MY OWN ONCE ASSURED THAT HE
IS INDELIBLY STAINED WITH CERTAIN DEFECTS OBNOXIOUS TO MY PRINCIPLES
AND I DISSOLVE THE CONNECTION
I DID SO WITH EDWARD
AS TO PELET THE
DISCOVERY WAS YET NEW SHOULD I ACT THUS WITH HIM IT WAS THE QUESTION I
PLACED BEFORE MY MIND AS I STIRRED MY CUP OF COFFEE WITH A HALF PISTOLET
WE NEVER HAD SPOONS PELET MEANTIME BEING SEATED OPPOSITE HIS PALLID
FACE LOOKING AS KNOWING AND MORE HAGGARD THAN USUAL HIS BLUE EYE
TURNED NOW STERNLY ON HIS BOYS AND USHERS AND NOW GRACIOUSLY ON ME
CIRCUMSTANCES MUST GUIDE ME SAID I AND MEETING PELET'S FALSE GLANCE
AND INSINUATING SMILE I THANKED HEAVEN THAT I HAD LAST NIGHT OPENED
MY WINDOW AND READ BY THE LIGHT OF A FULL MOON THE TRUE MEANING OF THAT
GUILEFUL COUNTENANCE
I FELT HALF HIS MASTER BECAUSE THE REALITY OF
HIS NATURE WAS NOW KNOWN TO ME SMILE AND FLATTER AS HE WOULD I SAW HIS
SOUL LURK BEHIND HIS SMILE AND HEARD IN EVERY ONE OF HIS SMOOTH PHRASES
A VOICE INTERPRETING THEIR TREACHEROUS IMPORT
BUT ZORAIDE REUTER OF COURSE HER DEFECTION HAD CUT ME TO THE QUICK
THAT STINT MUST HAVE GONE TOO DEEP FOR ANY CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY
TO BE AVAILABLE IN CURING ITS SMART NOT AT ALL
THE NIGHT FEVER OVER
I LOOKED ABOUT FOR BALM TO THAT WOUND ALSO AND FOUND SOME NEARER HOME
THAN AT GILEAD
REASON WAS MY PHYSICIAN SHE BEGAN BY PROVING THAT THE
PRIZE I HAD MISSED WAS OF LITTLE VALUE SHE ADMITTED THAT PHYSICALLY
ZORAIDE MIGHT HAVE SUITED ME BUT AFFIRMED THAT OUR SOULS WERE NOT IN
HARMONY AND THAT DISCORD MUST HAVE RESULTED FROM THE UNION OF HER MIND
WITH MINE
SHE THEN INSISTED ON THE SUPPRESSION OF ALL REPINING
AND COMMANDED ME RATHER TO REJOICE THAT I HAD ESCAPED A SNARE
HER
MEDICAMENT DID ME GOOD
I FELT ITS STRENGTHENING EFFECT WHEN I MET THE
DIRECTRESS THE NEXT DAY ITS STRINGENT OPERATION ON THE NERVES SUFFERED
NO TREMBLING NO FALTERING IT ENABLED ME TO FACE HER WITH FIRMNESS
TO PASS HER WITH EASE
SHE HAD HELD OUT HER HAND TO ME THAT I DID NOT
CHOOSE TO SEE
SHE HAD GREETED ME WITH A CHARMING SMILE IT FELL ON MY
HEART LIKE LIGHT ON STONE
I PASSED ON TO THE ESTRADE SHE FOLLOWED ME
HER EYE FASTENED ON MY FACE DEMANDED OF EVERY FEATURE THE MEANING OF
MY CHANGED AND CARELESS MANNER
I WILL GIVE HER AN ANSWER THOUGHT I
AND MEETING HER GAZE FULL ARRESTING FIXING HER GLANCE I SHOT INTO
HER EYES FROM MY OWN A LOOK WHERE THERE WAS NO RESPECT NO LOVE
NO TENDERNESS NO GALLANTRY WHERE THE STRICTEST ANALYSIS COULD DETECT
NOTHING BUT SCORN HARDIHOOD IRONY
I MADE HER BEAR IT AND FEEL IT
HER STEADY COUNTENANCE DID NOT CHANGE BUT HER COLOUR ROSE AND SHE
APPROACHED ME AS IF FASCINATED
SHE STEPPED ON TO THE ESTRADE AND
STOOD CLOSE BY MY SIDE SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
I WOULD NOT RELIEVE HER
EMBARRASSMENT AND NEGLIGENTLY TURNED OVER THE LEAVES OF A BOOK
I HOPE YOU FEEL QUITE RECOVERED TO DAY AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW
TONE
AND I MADEMOISELLE HOPE THAT YOU TOOK NO COLD LAST NIGHT IN
CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR LATE WALK IN THE GARDEN
QUICK ENOUGH OF COMPREHENSION SHE UNDERSTOOD ME DIRECTLY HER FACE
BECAME A LITTLE BLANCHED A VERY LITTLE BUT NO MUSCLE IN HER RATHER
MARKED FEATURES MOVED AND CALM AND SELF POSSESSED SHE RETIRED FROM
THE ESTRADE TAKING HER SEAT QUIETLY AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AND OCCUPYING
HERSELF WITH NETTING A PURSE
I PROCEEDED TO GIVE MY LESSON IT WAS A
COMPOSITION I E I DICTATED CERTAIN GENERAL QUESTIONS OF WHICH THE
PUPILS WERE TO COMPOSE THE ANSWERS FROM MEMORY ACCESS TO BOOKS BEING
FORBIDDEN
WHILE MDLLE
EULALIE HORTENSE CAROLINE C WERE PONDERING
OVER THE STRING OF RATHER ABSTRUSE GRAMMATICAL INTERROGATORIES I HAD
PROPOUNDED I WAS AT LIBERTY TO EMPLOY THE VACANT HALF HOUR IN FURTHER
OBSERVING THE DIRECTRESS HERSELF
THE GREEN SILK PURSE WAS PROGRESSING
FAST IN HER HANDS HER EYES WERE BENT UPON IT HER ATTITUDE AS SHE
SAT NETTING WITHIN TWO YARDS OF ME WAS STILL YET GUARDED IN HER WHOLE
PERSON WERE EXPRESSED AT ONCE AND WITH EQUAL CLEARNESS VIGILANCE AND
REPOSE A RARE UNION LOOKING AT HER I WAS FORCED AS I HAD OFTEN BEEN
BEFORE TO OFFER HER GOOD SENSE HER WONDROUS SELF CONTROL THE TRIBUTE
OF INVOLUNTARY ADMIRATION
SHE HAD FELT THAT I HAD WITHDRAWN FROM HER
MY ESTEEM SHE HAD SEEN CONTEMPT AND COLDNESS IN MY EYE AND TO HER WHO
COVETED THE APPROBATION OF ALL AROUND HER WHO THIRSTED AFTER UNIVERSAL
GOOD OPINION SUCH DISCOVERY MUST HAVE BEEN AN ACUTE WOUND
I HAD
WITNESSED ITS EFFECT IN THE MOMENTARY PALLOR OF HER CHEEK CHEEK UNUSED
TO VARY YET HOW QUICKLY BY DINT OF SELF CONTROL HAD SHE RECOVERED
HER COMPOSURE WITH WHAT QUIET DIGNITY SHE NOW SAT ALMOST AT MY SIDE
SUSTAINED BY HER SOUND AND VIGOROUS SENSE NO TREMBLING IN HER SOMEWHAT
LENGTHENED THOUGH SHREWD UPPER LIP NO COWARD SHAME ON HER AUSTERE
FOREHEAD
THERE IS METAL THERE I SAID AS I GAZED
WOULD THAT THERE WERE FIRE
ALSO LIVING ARDOUR TO MAKE THE STEEL GLOW THEN I COULD LOVE HER
PRESENTLY I DISCOVERED THAT SHE KNEW I WAS WATCHING HER FOR SHE STIRRED
NOT SHE LIFTED NOT HER CRAFTY EYELID SHE HAD GLANCED DOWN FROM HER
NETTING TO HER SMALL FOOT PEEPING FROM THE SOFT FOLDS OF HER PURPLE
MERINO GOWN THENCE HER EYE REVERTED TO HER HAND IVORY WHITE WITH A
BRIGHT GARNET RING ON THE FOREFINGER AND A LIGHT FRILL OF LACE ROUND
THE WRIST WITH A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT SHE TURNED HER HEAD
CAUSING HER NUT BROWN CURLS TO WAVE GRACEFULLY
IN THESE SLIGHT SIGNS
I READ THAT THE WISH OF HER HEART THE DESIGN OF HER BRAIN WAS TO LURE
BACK THE GAME SHE HAD SCARED
A LITTLE INCIDENT GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY
OF ADDRESSING ME AGAIN
WHILE ALL WAS SILENCE IN THE CLASS SILENCE BUT FOR THE RUSTLING OF
COPY BOOKS AND THE TRAVELLING OF PENS OVER THEIR PAGES A LEAF OF THE
LARGE FOLDING DOOR OPENING FROM THE HALL UNCLOSED ADMITTING A
PUPIL WHO AFTER MAKING A HASTY OBEISANCE ENSCONCED HERSELF WITH SOME
APPEARANCE OF TREPIDATION PROBABLY OCCASIONED BY HER ENTERING SO
LATE IN A VACANT SEAT AT THE DESK NEAREST THE DOOR
BEING SEATED SHE
PROCEEDED STILL WITH AN AIR OF HURRY AND EMBARRASSMENT TO OPEN HER
CABAS TO TAKE OUT HER BOOKS AND WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR HER TO LOOK
UP IN ORDER TO MAKE OUT HER IDENTITY FOR SHORTSIGHTED AS I WAS I HAD
NOT RECOGNIZED HER AT HER ENTRANCE MDLLE
REUTER LEAVING HER CHAIR
APPROACHED THE ESTRADE
MONSIEUR CREEMSVORT SAID SHE IN A WHISPER FOR WHEN THE SCHOOLROOMS
WERE SILENT THE DIRECTRESS ALWAYS MOVED WITH VELVET TREAD AND SPOKE
IN THE MOST SUBDUED KEY ENFORCING ORDER AND STILLNESS FULLY AS MUCH
BY EXAMPLE AS PRECEPT MONSIEUR CREEMSVORT THAT YOUNG PERSON WHO HAS
JUST ENTERED WISHES TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF TAKING LESSONS WITH YOU IN
ENGLISH SHE IS NOT A PUPIL OF THE HOUSE SHE IS INDEED IN ONE SENSE
A TEACHER FOR SHE GIVES INSTRUCTION IN LACE MENDING AND IN LITTLE
VARIETIES OF ORNAMENTAL NEEDLE WORK
SHE VERY PROPERLY PROPOSES TO
QUALIFY HERSELF FOR A HIGHER DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND HAS ASKED
PERMISSION TO ATTEND YOUR LESSONS IN ORDER TO PERFECT HER KNOWLEDGE
OF ENGLISH IN WHICH LANGUAGE SHE HAS I BELIEVE ALREADY MADE
SOME PROGRESS OF COURSE IT IS MY WISH TO AID HER IN AN EFFORT
SO PRAISEWORTHY YOU WILL PERMIT HER THEN TO BENEFIT BY YOUR
INSTRUCTION N'EST CE PAS MONSIEUR AND MDLLE
REUTER'S EYES WERE
RAISED TO MINE WITH A LOOK AT ONCE NAIVE BENIGN AND BESEECHING
I REPLIED OF COURSE VERY LACONICALLY ALMOST ABRUPTLY
ANOTHER WORD SHE SAID WITH SOFTNESS MDLLE
HENRI HAS NOT RECEIVED
A REGULAR EDUCATION PERHAPS HER NATURAL TALENTS ARE NOT OF THE HIGHEST
ORDER BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THE EXCELLENCE OF HER INTENTIONS AND
EVEN OF THE AMIABILITY OF HER DISPOSITION
MONSIEUR WILL THEN I AM
SURE HAVE THE GOODNESS TO BE CONSIDERATE WITH HER AT FIRST AND NOT
EXPOSE HER BACKWARDNESS HER INEVITABLE DEFICIENCIES BEFORE THE YOUNG
LADIES WHO IN A SENSE ARE HER PUPILS
WILL MONSIEUR CREEMSVORT FAVOUR
ME BY ATTENDING TO THIS HINT I NODDED
SHE CONTINUED WITH SUBDUED
EARNESTNESS
PARDON ME MONSIEUR IF I VENTURE TO ADD THAT WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID IS
OF IMPORTANCE TO THE POOR GIRL SHE ALREADY EXPERIENCES GREAT DIFFICULTY
IN IMPRESSING THESE GIDDY YOUNG THINGS WITH A DUE DEGREE OF DEFERENCE
FOR HER AUTHORITY AND SHOULD THAT DIFFICULTY BE INCREASED BY NEW
DISCOVERIES OF HER INCAPACITY SHE MIGHT FIND HER POSITION IN MY
ESTABLISHMENT TOO PAINFUL TO BE RETAINED A CIRCUMSTANCE I SHOULD MUCH
REGRET FOR HER SAKE AS SHE CAN ILL AFFORD TO LOSE THE PROFITS OF HER
OCCUPATION HERE
MDLLE
REUTER POSSESSED MARVELLOUS TACT BUT TACT THE MOST EXCLUSIVE
UNSUPPORTED BY SINCERITY WILL SOMETIMES FAIL OF ITS EFFECT THUS ON
THIS OCCASION THE LONGER SHE PREACHED ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF BEING
INDULGENT TO THE GOVERNESS PUPIL THE MORE IMPATIENT I FELT AS I
LISTENED
I DISCERNED SO CLEARLY THAT WHILE HER PROFESSED MOTIVE WAS A
WISH TO AID THE DULL THOUGH WELL MEANING MDLLE
HENRI HER REAL ONE
WAS NO OTHER THAN A DESIGN TO IMPRESS ME WITH AN IDEA OF HER OWN EXALTED
GOODNESS AND TENDER CONSIDERATENESS SO HAVING AGAIN HASTILY NODDED
ASSENT TO HER REMARKS I OBVIATED THEIR RENEWAL BY SUDDENLY DEMANDING
THE COMPOSITIONS IN A SHARP ACCENT AND STEPPING FROM THE ESTRADE I
PROCEEDED TO COLLECT THEM
AS I PASSED THE GOVERNESS PUPIL I SAID TO
HER
YOU HAVE COME IN TOO LATE TO RECEIVE A LESSON TO DAY TRY TO BE MORE
PUNCTUAL NEXT TIME
I WAS BEHIND HER AND COULD NOT READ IN HER FACE THE EFFECT OF MY NOT
VERY CIVIL SPEECH
PROBABLY I SHOULD NOT HAVE TROUBLED MYSELF TO DO SO
HAD I BEEN FULL IN FRONT BUT I OBSERVED THAT SHE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN
TO SLIP HER BOOKS INTO HER CABAS AGAIN AND PRESENTLY AFTER I HAD
RETURNED TO THE ESTRADE WHILE I WAS ARRANGING THE MASS OF COMPOSITIONS
I HEARD THE FOLDING DOOR AGAIN OPEN AND CLOSE AND ON LOOKING UP I
PERCEIVED HER PLACE VACANT
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF SHE WILL CONSIDER HER
FIRST ATTEMPT AT TAKING A LESSON IN ENGLISH SOMETHING OF A FAILURE AND
I WONDERED WHETHER SHE HAD DEPARTED IN THE SULKS OR WHETHER STUPIDITY
HAD INDUCED HER TO TAKE MY WORDS TOO LITERALLY OR FINALLY WHETHER
MY IRRITABLE TONE HAD WOUNDED HER FEELINGS
THE LAST NOTION I DISMISSED
ALMOST AS SOON AS I HAD CONCEIVED IT FOR NOT HAVING SEEN ANY APPEARANCE
OF SENSITIVENESS IN ANY HUMAN FACE SINCE MY ARRIVAL IN BELGIUM I HAD
BEGUN TO REGARD IT ALMOST AS A FABULOUS QUALITY
WHETHER HER PHYSIOGNOMY
ANNOUNCED IT I COULD NOT TELL FOR HER SPEEDY EXIT HAD ALLOWED ME NO
TIME TO ASCERTAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCE
I HAD INDEED ON TWO OR THREE
PREVIOUS OCCASIONS CAUGHT A PASSING VIEW OF HER AS I BELIEVE HAS BEEN
MENTIONED BEFORE BUT I HAD NEVER STOPPED TO SCRUTINIZE EITHER HER FACE
OR PERSON AND HAD BUT THE MOST VAGUE IDEA OF HER GENERAL APPEARANCE
JUST AS I HAD FINISHED ROLLING UP THE COMPOSITIONS THE FOUR O'CLOCK
BELL RANG WITH MY ACCUSTOMED ALERTNESS IN OBEYING THAT SIGNAL I
GRASPED MY HAT AND EVACUATED THE PREMISES
CHAPTER XIV
IF I WAS PUNCTUAL IN QUITTING MDLLE
REUTER'S DOMICILE I WAS AT LEAST
EQUALLY PUNCTUAL IN ARRIVING THERE I CAME THE NEXT DAY AT FIVE MINUTES
BEFORE TWO AND ON REACHING THE SCHOOLROOM DOOR BEFORE I OPENED IT I
HEARD A RAPID GABBLING SOUND WHICH WARNED ME THAT THE PRIERE DU MIDI
WAS NOT YET CONCLUDED
I WAITED THE TERMINATION THEREOF IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN IMPIOUS TO INTRUDE MY HERETICAL PRESENCE DURING ITS PROGRESS
HOW
THE REPEATER OF THE PRAYER DID CACKLE AND SPLUTTER I NEVER BEFORE OR
SINCE HEARD LANGUAGE ENOUNCED WITH SUCH STEAM ENGINE HASTE
NOTRE PERE
QUI ETES AU CIEL WENT OFF LIKE A SHOT THEN FOLLOWED AN ADDRESS TO
MARIE VIERGE CELESTE REINE DES ANGES MAISON D'OR TOUR D'IVOIRE AND
THEN AN INVOCATION TO THE SAINT OF THE DAY AND THEN DOWN THEY ALL SAT
AND THE SOLEMN RITE WAS OVER AND I ENTERED FLINGING THE DOOR WIDE
AND STRIDING IN FAST AS IT WAS MY WONT TO DO NOW FOR I HAD FOUND
THAT IN ENTERING WITH APLOMB AND MOUNTING THE ESTRADE WITH EMPHASIS
CONSISTED THE GRAND SECRET OF ENSURING IMMEDIATE SILENCE
THE
FOLDING DOORS BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES OPENED FOR THE PRAYER WERE
INSTANTLY CLOSED A MAITRESSE WORK BOX IN HAND TOOK HER SEAT AT HER
APPROPRIATE DESK THE PUPILS SAT STILL WITH THEIR PENS AND BOOKS BEFORE
THEM MY THREE BEAUTIES IN THE VAN NOW WELL HUMBLED BY A DEMEANOUR OF
CONSISTENT COOLNESS SAT ERECT WITH THEIR HANDS FOLDED QUIETLY ON THEIR
KNEES THEY HAD GIVEN UP GIGGLING AND WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER AND NO
LONGER VENTURED TO UTTER PERT SPEECHES IN MY PRESENCE THEY NOW ONLY
TALKED TO ME OCCASIONALLY WITH THEIR EYES BY MEANS OF WHICH ORGANS
THEY COULD STILL HOWEVER SAY VERY AUDACIOUS AND COQUETTISH THINGS
HAD
AFFECTION GOODNESS MODESTY REAL TALENT EVER EMPLOYED THOSE BRIGHT
ORBS AS INTERPRETERS I DO NOT THINK I COULD HAVE REFRAINED FROM GIVING
A KIND AND ENCOURAGING PERHAPS AN ARDENT REPLY NOW AND THEN BUT AS IT
WAS I FOUND PLEASURE IN ANSWERING THE GLANCE OF VANITY WITH THE GAZE
OF STOICISM
YOUTHFUL FAIR BRILLIANT AS WERE MANY OF MY PUPILS I CAN
TRULY SAY THAT IN ME THEY NEVER SAW ANY OTHER BEARING THAN SUCH AS AN
AUSTERE THOUGH JUST GUARDIAN MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED TOWARDS THEM
IF ANY
DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THIS ASSERTION AS INFERRING MORE CONSCIENTIOUS
SELF DENIAL OR SCIPIO LIKE SELF CONTROL THAN THEY FEEL DISPOSED TO
GIVE ME CREDIT FOR LET THEM TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE FOLLOWING
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WHILE DETRACTING FROM MY MERIT JUSTIFY MY
VERACITY
KNOW O INCREDULOUS READER THAT A MASTER STANDS IN A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT
RELATION TOWARDS A PRETTY LIGHT HEADED PROBABLY IGNORANT GIRL TO
THAT OCCUPIED BY A PARTNER AT A BALL OR A GALLANT ON THE PROMENADE
A PROFESSOR DOES NOT MEET HIS PUPIL TO SEE HER DRESSED IN SATIN AND
MUSLIN WITH HAIR PERFUMED AND CURLED NECK SCARCELY SHADED BY AERIAL
LACE ROUND WHITE ARMS CIRCLED WITH BRACELETS FEET DRESSED FOR THE
GLIDING DANCE
IT IS NOT HIS BUSINESS TO WHIRL HER THROUGH THE WALTZ
TO FEED HER WITH COMPLIMENTS TO HEIGHTEN HER BEAUTY BY THE FLUSH OF
GRATIFIED VANITY
NEITHER DOES HE ENCOUNTER HER ON THE SMOOTH ROLLED
TREE SHADED BOULEVARD IN THE GREEN AND SUNNY PARK WHITHER SHE REPAIRS
CLAD IN HER BECOMING WALKING DRESS HER SCARF THROWN WITH GRACE OVER HER
SHOULDERS HER LITTLE BONNET SCARCELY SCREENING HER CURLS THE RED ROSE
UNDER ITS BRIM ADDING A NEW TINT TO THE SOFTER ROSE ON HER CHEEK HER
FACE AND EYES TOO ILLUMINED WITH SMILES PERHAPS AS TRANSIENT AS THE
SUNSHINE OF THE GALA DAY BUT ALSO QUITE AS BRILLIANT IT IS NOT HIS
OFFICE TO WALK BY HER SIDE TO LISTEN TO HER LIVELY CHAT TO CARRY HER
PARASOL SCARCELY LARGER THAN A BROAD GREEN LEAF TO LEAD IN A RIBBON
HER BLENHEIM SPANIEL OR ITALIAN GREYHOUND
NO HE FINDS HER IN THE
SCHOOLROOM PLAINLY DRESSED WITH BOOKS BEFORE HER
OWING TO HER
EDUCATION OR HER NATURE BOOKS ARE TO HER A NUISANCE AND SHE OPENS THEM
WITH AVERSION YET HER TEACHER MUST INSTIL INTO HER MIND THE CONTENTS
OF THESE BOOKS THAT MIND RESISTS THE ADMISSION OF GRAVE INFORMATION IT
RECOILS IT GROWS RESTIVE SULLEN TEMPERS ARE SHOWN DISFIGURING FROWNS
SPOIL THE SYMMETRY OF THE FACE SOMETIMES COARSE GESTURES BANISH GRACE
FROM THE DEPORTMENT WHILE MUTTERED EXPRESSIONS REDOLENT OF NATIVE AND
INERADICABLE VULGARITY DESECRATE THE SWEETNESS OF THE VOICE
WHERE THE
TEMPERAMENT IS SERENE THOUGH THE INTELLECT BE SLUGGISH AN UNCONQUERABLE
DULLNESS OPPOSES EVERY EFFORT TO INSTRUCT
WHERE THERE IS CUNNING BUT
NOT ENERGY DISSIMULATION FALSEHOOD A THOUSAND SCHEMES AND TRICKS
ARE PUT IN PLAY TO EVADE THE NECESSITY OF APPLICATION IN SHORT TO THE
TUTOR FEMALE YOUTH FEMALE CHARMS ARE LIKE TAPESTRY HANGINGS OF WHICH
THE WRONG SIDE IS CONTINUALLY TURNED TOWARDS HIM AND EVEN WHEN HE SEES
THE SMOOTH NEAT EXTERNAL SURFACE HE SO WELL KNOWS WHAT KNOTS LONG
STITCHES AND JAGGED ENDS ARE BEHIND THAT HE HAS SCARCE A TEMPTATION TO
ADMIRE TOO FONDLY THE SEEMLY FORMS AND BRIGHT COLOURS EXPOSED TO GENERAL
VIEW
OUR LIKINGS ARE REGULATED BY OUR CIRCUMSTANCES
THE ARTIST PREFERS A
HILLY COUNTRY BECAUSE IT IS PICTURESQUE THE ENGINEER A FLAT ONE BECAUSE
IT IS CONVENIENT THE MAN OF PLEASURE LIKES WHAT HE CALLS A FINE
WOMAN SHE SUITS HIM THE FASHIONABLE YOUNG GENTLEMAN ADMIRES THE
FASHIONABLE YOUNG LADY SHE IS OF HIS KIND THE TOIL WORN FAGGED
PROBABLY IRRITABLE TUTOR BLIND ALMOST TO BEAUTY INSENSIBLE TO AIRS AND
GRACES GLORIES CHIEFLY IN CERTAIN MENTAL QUALITIES APPLICATION LOVE
OF KNOWLEDGE NATURAL CAPACITY DOCILITY TRUTHFULNESS GRATEFULNESS
ARE THE CHARMS THAT ATTRACT HIS NOTICE AND WIN HIS REGARD
THESE HE
SEEKS BUT SELDOM MEETS THESE IF BY CHANCE HE FINDS HE WOULD FAIN
RETAIN FOR EVER AND WHEN SEPARATION DEPRIVES HIM OF THEM HE FEELS AS IF
SOME RUTHLESS HAND HAD SNATCHED FROM HIM HIS ONLY EWE LAMB
SUCH BEING
THE CASE AND THE CASE IT IS MY READERS WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT THERE
WAS NOTHING EITHER VERY MERITORIOUS OR VERY MARVELLOUS IN THE
INTEGRITY AND MODERATION OF MY CONDUCT AT MDLLE
REUTER'S PENSIONNAT DE
DEMOISELLES
MY FIRST BUSINESS THIS AFTERNOON CONSISTED IN READING THE LIST OF
PLACES FOR THE MONTH DETERMINED BY THE RELATIVE CORRECTNESS OF THE
COMPOSITIONS GIVEN THE PRECEDING DAY
THE LIST WAS HEADED AS USUAL
BY THE NAME OF SYLVIE THAT PLAIN QUIET LITTLE GIRL I HAVE DESCRIBED
BEFORE AS BEING AT ONCE THE BEST AND UGLIEST PUPIL IN THE ESTABLISHMENT
THE SECOND PLACE HAD FALLEN TO THE LOT OF A CERTAIN LEONIE LEDRU A
DIMINUTIVE SHARP FEATURED AND PARCHMENT SKINNED CREATURE OF QUICK
WITS FRAIL CONSCIENCE AND INDURATED FEELINGS A LAWYER LIKE THING OF
WHOM I USED TO SAY THAT HAD SHE BEEN A BOY SHE WOULD HAVE MADE A
MODEL OF AN UNPRINCIPLED CLEVER ATTORNEY
THEN CAME EULALIE THE PROUD
BEAUTY THE JUNO OF THE SCHOOL WHOM SIX LONG YEARS OF DRILLING IN THE
SIMPLE GRAMMAR OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAD COMPELLED DESPITE THE STIFF
PHLEGM OF HER INTELLECT TO ACQUIRE A MECHANICAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH MOST
OF ITS RULES
NO SMILE NO TRACE OF PLEASURE OR SATISFACTION APPEARED IN
SYLVIE'S NUN LIKE AND PASSIVE FACE AS SHE HEARD HER NAME READ FIRST
I ALWAYS FELT SADDENED BY THE SIGHT OF THAT POOR GIRL'S ABSOLUTE
QUIESCENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS AND IT WAS MY CUSTOM TO LOOK AT HER TO
ADDRESS HER AS SELDOM AS POSSIBLE HER EXTREME DOCILITY HER ASSIDUOUS
PERSEVERANCE WOULD HAVE RECOMMENDED HER WARMLY TO MY GOOD OPINION
HER MODESTY HER INTELLIGENCE WOULD HAVE INDUCED ME TO FEEL MOST
KINDLY MOST AFFECTIONATELY TOWARDS HER NOTWITHSTANDING THE ALMOST
GHASTLY PLAINNESS OF HER FEATURES THE DISPROPORTION OF HER FORM THE
CORPSE LIKE LACK OF ANIMATION IN HER COUNTENANCE HAD I NOT BEEN AWARE
THAT EVERY FRIENDLY WORD EVERY KINDLY ACTION WOULD BE REPORTED BY HER
TO HER CONFESSOR AND BY HIM MISINTERPRETED AND POISONED
ONCE I LAID MY
HAND ON HER HEAD IN TOKEN OF APPROBATION I THOUGHT SYLVIE WAS GOING TO
SMILE HER DIM EYE ALMOST KINDLED BUT PRESENTLY SHE SHRANK FROM ME
I WAS A MAN AND A HERETIC SHE POOR CHILD A DESTINED NUN AND DEVOTED
CATHOLIC THUS A FOUR FOLD WALL OF SEPARATION DIVIDED HER MIND FROM
MINE
A PERT SMIRK AND A HARD GLANCE OF TRIUMPH WAS LEONIE'S METHOD OF
TESTIFYING HER GRATIFICATION EULALIE LOOKED SULLEN AND ENVIOUS SHE HAD
HOPED TO BE FIRST
HORTENSE AND CAROLINE EXCHANGED A RECKLESS GRIMACE ON
HEARING THEIR NAMES READ OUT SOMEWHERE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST THE
BRAND OF MENTAL INFERIORITY WAS CONSIDERED BY THEM AS NO DISGRACE THEIR
HOPES FOR THE FUTURE BEING BASED SOLELY ON THEIR PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS
THIS AFFAIR ARRANGED THE REGULAR LESSON FOLLOWED
DURING A BRIEF
INTERVAL EMPLOYED BY THE PUPILS IN RULING THEIR BOOKS MY EYE RANGING
CARELESSLY OVER THE BENCHES OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE
FARTHEST SEAT IN THE FARTHEST ROW A SEAT USUALLY VACANT WAS
AGAIN FILLED BY THE NEW SCHOLAR THE MDLLE
HENRI SO OSTENTATIOUSLY
RECOMMENDED TO ME BY THE DIRECTRESS
TO DAY I HAD ON MY SPECTACLES HER
APPEARANCE THEREFORE WAS CLEAR TO ME AT THE FIRST GLANCE I HAD NOT TO
PUZZLE OVER IT
SHE LOOKED YOUNG YET HAD I BEEN REQUIRED TO NAME HER
EXACT AGE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT NONPLUSSED THE SLIGHTNESS OF HER
FIGURE MIGHT HAVE SUITED SEVENTEEN A CERTAIN ANXIOUS AND PRE OCCUPIED
EXPRESSION OF FACE SEEMED THE INDICATION OF RIPER YEARS
SHE WAS
DRESSED LIKE ALL THE REST IN A DARK STUFF GOWN AND A WHITE COLLAR HER
FEATURES WERE DISSIMILAR TO ANY THERE NOT SO ROUNDED MORE DEFINED YET
SCARCELY REGULAR
THE SHAPE OF HER HEAD TOO WAS DIFFERENT THE SUPERIOR
PART MORE DEVELOPED THE BASE CONSIDERABLY LESS
I FELT ASSURED
AT FIRST SIGHT THAT SHE WAS NOT A BELGIAN HER COMPLEXION HER
COUNTENANCE HER LINEAMENTS HER FIGURE WERE ALL DISTINCT FROM THEIRS
AND EVIDENTLY THE TYPE OF ANOTHER RACE OF A RACE LESS GIFTED WITH
FULLNESS OF FLESH AND PLENITUDE OF BLOOD LESS JOCUND MATERIAL
UNTHINKING
WHEN I FIRST CAST MY EYES ON HER SHE SAT LOOKING FIXEDLY
DOWN HER CHIN RESTING ON HER HAND AND SHE DID NOT CHANGE HER ATTITUDE
TILL I COMMENCED THE LESSON
NONE OF THE BELGIAN GIRLS WOULD HAVE
RETAINED ONE POSITION AND THAT A REFLECTIVE ONE FOR THE SAME LENGTH OF
TIME
YET HAVING INTIMATED THAT HER APPEARANCE WAS PECULIAR AS
BEING UNLIKE THAT OF HER FLEMISH COMPANIONS I HAVE LITTLE MORE TO SAY
RESPECTING IT I CAN PRONOUNCE NO ENCOMIUMS ON HER BEAUTY FOR SHE WAS
NOT BEAUTIFUL NOR OFFER CONDOLENCE ON HER PLAINNESS FOR NEITHER
WAS SHE PLAIN A CAREWORN CHARACTER OF FOREHEAD AND A CORRESPONDING
MOULDING OF THE MOUTH STRUCK ME WITH A SENTIMENT RESEMBLING SURPRISE
BUT THESE TRAITS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE PASSED UNNOTICED BY ANY LESS
CROTCHETY OBSERVER
NOW READER THOUGH I HAVE SPENT MORE THAN A PAGE IN DESCRIBING MDLLE
HENRI I KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT I HAVE LEFT ON YOUR MIND'S EYE NO
DISTINCT PICTURE OF HER I HAVE NOT PAINTED HER COMPLEXION NOR HER
EYES NOR HER HAIR NOR EVEN DRAWN THE OUTLINE OF HER SHAPE
YOU CANNOT
TELL WHETHER HER NOSE WAS AQUILINE OR RETROUSSE WHETHER HER CHIN WAS
LONG OR SHORT HER FACE SQUARE OR OVAL NOR COULD I THE FIRST DAY
AND IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO COMMUNICATE TO YOU AT ONCE A KNOWLEDGE I
MYSELF GAINED BY LITTLE AND LITTLE
I GAVE A SHORT EXERCISE WHICH THEY ALL WROTE DOWN
I SAW THE NEW PUPIL
WAS PUZZLED AT FIRST WITH THE NOVELTY OF THE FORM AND LANGUAGE ONCE
OR TWICE SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A SORT OF PAINFUL SOLICITUDE AS NOT
COMPREHENDING AT ALL WHAT I MEANT THEN SHE WAS NOT READY WHEN THE
OTHERS WERE SHE COULD NOT WRITE HER PHRASES SO FAST AS THEY DID I
WOULD NOT HELP HER I WENT ON RELENTLESS
SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYE
SAID MOST PLAINLY I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU I DISREGARDED THE APPEAL AND
CARELESSLY LEANING BACK IN MY CHAIR GLANCING FROM TIME TO TIME WITH A
NONCHALANT AIR OUT OF THE WINDOW I DICTATED A LITTLE FASTER
ON LOOKING
TOWARDS HER AGAIN I PERCEIVED HER FACE CLOUDED WITH EMBARRASSMENT BUT
SHE WAS STILL WRITING ON MOST DILIGENTLY I PAUSED A FEW SECONDS SHE
EMPLOYED THE INTERVAL IN HURRIEDLY RE PERUSING WHAT SHE HAD WRITTEN AND
SHAME AND DISCOMFITURE WERE APPARENT IN HER COUNTENANCE SHE EVIDENTLY
FOUND SHE HAD MADE GREAT NONSENSE OF IT
IN TEN MINUTES MORE THE
DICTATION WAS COMPLETE AND HAVING ALLOWED A BRIEF SPACE IN WHICH TO
CORRECT IT I TOOK THEIR BOOKS IT WAS WITH A RELUCTANT HAND MDLLE
HENRI GAVE UP HERS BUT HAVING ONCE YIELDED IT TO MY POSSESSION SHE
COMPOSED HER ANXIOUS FACE AS IF FOR THE PRESENT SHE HAD RESOLVED TO
DISMISS REGRET AND HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO BE THOUGHT UNPRECEDENTEDLY
STUPID
GLANCING OVER HER EXERCISE I FOUND THAT SEVERAL LINES HAD BEEN
OMITTED BUT WHAT WAS WRITTEN CONTAINED VERY FEW FAULTS I INSTANTLY
INSCRIBED BON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE AND RETURNED IT TO HER SHE
SMILED AT FIRST INCREDULOUSLY THEN AS IF REASSURED BUT DID NOT
LIFT HER EYES SHE COULD LOOK AT ME IT SEEMED WHEN PERPLEXED AND
BEWILDERED BUT NOT WHEN GRATIFIED I THOUGHT THAT SCARCELY FAIR
CHAPTER XV
SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I AGAIN GAVE A LESSON IN THE FIRST CLASS THE
HOLIDAY OF WHITSUNTIDE OCCUPIED THREE DAYS AND ON THE FOURTH IT WAS THE
TURN OF THE SECOND DIVISION TO RECEIVE MY INSTRUCTIONS
AS I MADE
THE TRANSIT OF THE CARRE I OBSERVED AS USUAL THE BAND OF SEWERS
SURROUNDING MDLLE
HENRI THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT A DOZEN OF THEM BUT
THEY MADE AS MUCH NOISE AS MIGHT HAVE SUFFICED FOR FIFTY THEY SEEMED
VERY LITTLE UNDER HER CONTROL THREE OR FOUR AT ONCE ASSAILED HER WITH
IMPORTUNATE REQUIREMENTS SHE LOOKED HARASSED SHE DEMANDED SILENCE BUT
IN VAIN
SHE SAW ME AND I READ IN HER EYE PAIN THAT A STRANGER SHOULD
WITNESS THE INSUBORDINATION OF HER PUPILS SHE SEEMED TO ENTREAT
ORDER HER PRAYERS WERE USELESS THEN I REMARKED THAT SHE COMPRESSED
HER LIPS AND CONTRACTED HER BROW AND HER COUNTENANCE IF I READ
IT CORRECTLY SAID I HAVE DONE MY BEST I SEEM TO MERIT BLAME
NOTWITHSTANDING BLAME ME THEN WHO WILL I PASSED ON AS I CLOSED THE
SCHOOL ROOM DOOR I HEARD HER SAY SUDDENLY AND SHARPLY ADDRESSING ONE
OF THE ELDEST AND MOST TURBULENT OF THE LOT
AMELIE MULLENBERG ASK ME NO QUESTION AND REQUEST OF ME NO ASSISTANCE
FOR A WEEK TO COME DURING THAT SPACE OF TIME I WILL NEITHER SPEAK TO
YOU NOR HELP YOU
THE WORDS WERE UTTERED WITH EMPHASIS NAY WITH VEHEMENCE AND A
COMPARATIVE SILENCE FOLLOWED WHETHER THE CALM WAS PERMANENT I KNOW
NOT TWO DOORS NOW CLOSED BETWEEN ME AND THE CARRE
NEXT DAY WAS APPROPRIATED TO THE FIRST CLASS ON MY ARRIVAL I FOUND THE
DIRECTRESS SEATED AS USUAL IN A CHAIR BETWEEN THE TWO ESTRADES AND
BEFORE HER WAS STANDING MDLLE
HENRI IN AN ATTITUDE AS IT SEEMED TO
ME OF SOMEWHAT RELUCTANT ATTENTION
THE DIRECTRESS WAS KNITTING AND
TALKING AT THE SAME TIME
AMIDST THE HUM OF A LARGE SCHOOL ROOM IT WAS
EASY SO TO SPEAK IN THE EAR OF ONE PERSON AS TO BE HEARD BY THAT PERSON
ALONE AND IT WAS THUS MDLLE
REUTER PARLEYED WITH HER TEACHER
THE FACE
OF THE LATTER WAS A LITTLE FLUSHED NOT A LITTLE TROUBLED THERE WAS
VEXATION IN IT WHENCE RESULTING I KNOW NOT FOR THE DIRECTRESS LOOKED
VERY PLACID INDEED SHE COULD NOT BE SCOLDING IN SUCH GENTLE WHISPERS
AND WITH SO EQUABLE A MIEN NO IT WAS PRESENTLY PROVED THAT HER
DISCOURSE HAD BEEN OF THE MOST FRIENDLY TENDENCY FOR I HEARD THE
CLOSING WORDS
C'EST ASSEZ MA BONNE AMIE A PRESENT JE NE VEUX PAS VOUS RETENIR
DAVANTAGE
WITHOUT REPLY MDLLE
HENRI TURNED AWAY DISSATISFACTION WAS PLAINLY
EVINCED IN HER FACE AND A SMILE SLIGHT AND BRIEF BUT BITTER
DISTRUSTFUL AND I THOUGHT SCORNFUL CURLED HER LIP AS SHE TOOK HER
PLACE IN THE CLASS IT WAS A SECRET INVOLUNTARY SMILE WHICH LASTED BUT
A SECOND AN AIR OF DEPRESSION SUCCEEDED CHASED AWAY PRESENTLY BY ONE
OF ATTENTION AND INTEREST WHEN I GAVE THE WORD FOR ALL THE PUPILS TO
TAKE THEIR READING BOOKS
IN GENERAL I HATED THE READING LESSON IT
WAS SUCH A TORTURE TO THE EAR TO LISTEN TO THEIR UNCOUTH MOUTHING OF
MY NATIVE TONGUE AND NO EFFORT OF EXAMPLE OR PRECEPT ON MY PART EVER
SEEMED TO EFFECT THE SLIGHTEST IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR ACCENT
TO DAY
EACH IN HER APPROPRIATE KEY LISPED STUTTERED MUMBLED AND JABBERED AS
USUAL ABOUT FIFTEEN HAD RACKED ME IN TURN AND MY AURICULAR NERVE WAS
EXPECTING WITH RESIGNATION THE DISCORDS OF THE SIXTEENTH WHEN A FULL
THOUGH LOW VOICE READ OUT IN CLEAR CORRECT ENGLISH
ON HIS WAY TO PERTH THE KING WAS MET BY A HIGHLAND WOMAN CALLING
HERSELF A PROPHETESS SHE STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE FERRY BY WHICH HE WAS
ABOUT TO TRAVEL TO THE NORTH AND CRIED WITH A LOUD VOICE 'MY LORD THE
KING IF YOU PASS THIS WATER YOU WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN ALIVE VIDE
THE HISTORY OF SCOTLAND
I LOOKED UP IN AMAZEMENT THE VOICE WAS A VOICE OF ALBION THE ACCENT
WAS PURE AND SILVERY IT ONLY WANTED FIRMNESS AND ASSURANCE TO BE THE
COUNTERPART OF WHAT ANY WELL EDUCATED LADY IN ESSEX OR MIDDLESEX MIGHT
HAVE ENOUNCED YET THE SPEAKER OR READER WAS NO OTHER THAN MDLLE
HENRI
IN WHOSE GRAVE JOYLESS FACE I SAW NO MARK OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE HAD
PERFORMED ANY EXTRAORDINARY FEAT
NO ONE ELSE EVINCED SURPRISE EITHER
MDLLE
REUTER KNITTED AWAY ASSIDUOUSLY I WAS AWARE HOWEVER THAT AT
THE CONCLUSION OF THE PARAGRAPH SHE HAD LIFTED HER EYELID AND HONOURED
ME WITH A GLANCE SIDEWAYS SHE DID NOT KNOW THE FULL EXCELLENCY OF THE
TEACHER'S STYLE OF READING BUT SHE PERCEIVED THAT HER ACCENT WAS NOT
THAT OF THE OTHERS AND WANTED TO DISCOVER WHAT I THOUGHT I MASKED MY
VISAGE WITH INDIFFERENCE AND ORDERED THE NEXT GIRL TO PROCEED
WHEN THE LESSON WAS OVER I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE CONFUSION CAUSED BY
BREAKING UP TO APPROACH MDLLE
HENRI SHE WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW
AND RETIRED AS I ADVANCED SHE THOUGHT I WANTED TO LOOK OUT AND DID
NOT IMAGINE THAT I COULD HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO HER
I TOOK HER
EXERCISE BOOK OUT OF HER HAND AS I TURNED OVER THE LEAVES I ADDRESSED
HER
YOU HAVE HAD LESSONS IN ENGLISH BEFORE I ASKED
NO SIR
NO YOU READ IT WELL YOU HAVE BEEN IN ENGLAND
OH NO WITH SOME ANIMATION
YOU HAVE BEEN IN ENGLISH FAMILIES
STILL THE ANSWER WAS NO HERE MY EYE RESTING ON THE FLYLEAF OF THE
BOOK SAW WRITTEN FRANCES EVAN HENRI
YOUR NAME I ASKED
YES SIR
MY INTERROGATIONS WERE CUT SHORT I HEARD A LITTLE RUSTLING BEHIND ME
AND CLOSE AT MY BACK WAS THE DIRECTRESS PROFESSING TO BE EXAMINING THE
INTERIOR OF A DESK
MADEMOISELLE SAID SHE LOOKING UP AND ADDRESSING THE TEACHER WILL
YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO GO AND STAND IN THE CORRIDOR WHILE THE YOUNG
LADIES ARE PUTTING ON THEIR THINGS AND TRY TO KEEP SOME ORDER
MDLLE
HENRI OBEYED
WHAT SPLENDID WEATHER OBSERVED THE DIRECTRESS CHEERFULLY GLANCING AT
THE SAME TIME FROM THE WINDOW
I ASSENTED AND WAS WITHDRAWING
WHAT OF
YOUR NEW PUPIL MONSIEUR CONTINUED SHE FOLLOWING MY RETREATING STEPS
IS SHE LIKELY TO MAKE PROGRESS IN ENGLISH
INDEED I CAN HARDLY JUDGE
SHE POSSESSES A PRETTY GOOD ACCENT OF
HER REAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE LANGUAGE I HAVE AS YET HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF
FORMING AN OPINION
AND HER NATURAL CAPACITY MONSIEUR I HAVE HAD MY FEARS ABOUT THAT CAN
YOU RELIEVE ME BY AN ASSURANCE AT LEAST OF ITS AVERAGE POWER
I SEE NO REASON TO DOUBT ITS AVERAGE POWER MADEMOISELLE BUT REALLY
I SCARCELY KNOW HER AND HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO STUDY THE CALIBRE OF HER
CAPACITY
I WISH YOU A VERY GOOD AFTERNOON
SHE STILL PURSUED ME
YOU WILL OBSERVE MONSIEUR AND TELL ME WHAT YOU
THINK I COULD SO MUCH BETTER RELY ON YOUR OPINION THAN ON MY OWN WOMEN
CANNOT JUDGE OF THESE THINGS AS MEN CAN AND EXCUSE MY PERTINACITY
MONSIEUR BUT IT IS NATURAL I SHOULD FEEL INTERESTED ABOUT THIS POOR
LITTLE GIRL PAUVRE PETITE SHE HAS SCARCELY ANY RELATIONS HER OWN
EFFORTS ARE ALL SHE HAS TO LOOK TO HER ACQUIREMENTS MUST BE HER SOLE
FORTUNE HER PRESENT POSITION HAS ONCE BEEN MINE OR NEARLY SO IT IS
THEN BUT NATURAL I SHOULD SYMPATHIZE WITH HER AND SOMETIMES WHEN I SEE
THE DIFFICULTY SHE HAS IN MANAGING PUPILS I FEEL QUITE CHAGRINED
I DOUBT NOT SHE DOES HER BEST HER INTENTIONS ARE EXCELLENT BUT
MONSIEUR SHE WANTS TACT AND FIRMNESS
I HAVE TALKED TO HER ON THE
SUBJECT BUT I AM NOT FLUENT AND PROBABLY DID NOT EXPRESS MYSELF
WITH CLEARNESS SHE NEVER APPEARS TO COMPREHEND ME
NOW WOULD YOU
OCCASIONALLY WHEN YOU SEE AN OPPORTUNITY SLIP IN A WORD OF ADVICE
TO HER ON THE SUBJECT MEN HAVE SO MUCH MORE INFLUENCE THAN WOMEN
HAVE THEY ARGUE SO MUCH MORE LOGICALLY THAN WE DO AND YOU MONSIEUR
IN PARTICULAR HAVE SO PARAMOUNT A POWER OF MAKING YOURSELF OBEYED
A WORD OF ADVICE FROM YOU COULD NOT BUT DO HER GOOD EVEN IF SHE WERE
SULLEN AND HEADSTRONG WHICH I HOPE SHE IS NOT SHE WOULD SCARCELY
REFUSE TO LISTEN TO YOU FOR MY OWN PART I CAN TRULY SAY THAT I NEVER
ATTEND ONE OF YOUR LESSONS WITHOUT DERIVING BENEFIT FROM WITNESSING YOUR
MANAGEMENT OF THE PUPILS
THE OTHER MASTERS ARE A CONSTANT SOURCE OF
ANXIETY TO ME THEY CANNOT IMPRESS THE YOUNG LADIES WITH SENTIMENTS OF
RESPECT NOR RESTRAIN THE LEVITY NATURAL TO YOUTH IN YOU MONSIEUR I
FEEL THE MOST ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE TRY THEN TO PUT THIS POOR CHILD
INTO THE WAY OF CONTROLLING OUR GIDDY HIGH SPIRITED BRABANTOISES
BUT MONSIEUR I WOULD ADD ONE WORD MORE DON'T ALARM HER AMOUR PROPRE
BEWARE OF INFLICTING A WOUND THERE
I RELUCTANTLY ADMIT THAT IN THAT
PARTICULAR SHE IS BLAMEABLY SOME WOULD SAY RIDICULOUSLY SUSCEPTIBLE
I FEAR I HAVE TOUCHED THIS SORE POINT INADVERTENTLY AND SHE CANNOT GET
OVER IT
DURING THE GREATER PART OF THIS HARANGUE MY HAND WAS ON THE LOCK OF THE
OUTER DOOR I NOW TURNED IT
AU REVOIR MADEMOISELLE SAID I AND I ESCAPED
I SAW THE DIRECTRESS'S
STOCK OF WORDS WAS YET FAR FROM EXHAUSTED
SHE LOOKED AFTER ME SHE
WOULD FAIN HAVE DETAINED ME LONGER
HER MANNER TOWARDS ME HAD
BEEN ALTERED EVER SINCE I HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HER WITH HARDNESS AND
INDIFFERENCE SHE ALMOST CRINGED TO ME ON EVERY OCCASION SHE CONSULTED
MY COUNTENANCE INCESSANTLY AND BESET ME WITH INNUMERABLE LITTLE
OFFICIOUS ATTENTIONS
SERVILITY CREATES DESPOTISM
THIS SLAVISH HOMAGE
INSTEAD OF SOFTENING MY HEART ONLY PAMPERED WHATEVER WAS STERN AND
EXACTING IN ITS MOOD
THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER HOVERING ROUND ME
LIKE A FASCINATED BIRD SEEMED TO TRANSFORM ME INTO A RIGID PILLAR OF
STONE HER FLATTERIES IRRITATED MY SCORN HER BLANDISHMENTS CONFIRMED
MY RESERVE
AT TIMES I WONDERED WHAT SHE MEANT BY GIVING HERSELF SUCH
TROUBLE TO WIN ME WHEN THE MORE PROFITABLE PELET WAS ALREADY IN HER
NETS AND WHEN TOO SHE WAS AWARE THAT I POSSESSED HER SECRET FOR I
HAD NOT SCRUPLED TO TELL HER AS MUCH BUT THE FACT IS THAT AS IT WAS
HER NATURE TO DOUBT THE REALITY AND UNDER VALUE THE WORTH OF MODESTY
AFFECTION DISINTERESTEDNESS TO REGARD THESE QUALITIES AS FOIBLES OF
CHARACTER SO IT WAS EQUALLY HER TENDENCY TO CONSIDER PRIDE HARDNESS
SELFISHNESS AS PROOFS OF STRENGTH
SHE WOULD TRAMPLE ON THE NECK
OF HUMILITY SHE WOULD KNEEL AT THE FEET OF DISDAIN SHE WOULD MEET
TENDERNESS WITH SECRET CONTEMPT INDIFFERENCE SHE WOULD WOO WITH
CEASELESS ASSIDUITIES
BENEVOLENCE DEVOTEDNESS ENTHUSIASM WERE
HER ANTIPATHIES FOR DISSIMULATION AND SELF INTEREST SHE HAD A
PREFERENCE THEY WERE REAL WISDOM IN HER EYES MORAL AND PHYSICAL
DEGRADATION MENTAL AND BODILY INFERIORITY SHE REGARDED WITH
INDULGENCE THEY WERE FOILS CAPABLE OF BEING TURNED TO GOOD ACCOUNT AS
SET OFFS FOR HER OWN ENDOWMENTS
TO VIOLENCE INJUSTICE TYRANNY SHE
SUCCUMBED THEY WERE HER NATURAL MASTERS SHE HAD NO PROPENSITY TO HATE
NO IMPULSE TO RESIST THEM THE INDIGNATION THEIR BEHESTS AWAKE IN SOME
HEARTS WAS UNKNOWN IN HERS
FROM ALL THIS IT RESULTED THAT THE FALSE AND
SELFISH CALLED HER WISE THE VULGAR AND DEBASED TERMED HER CHARITABLE
THE INSOLENT AND UNJUST DUBBED HER AMIABLE THE CONSCIENTIOUS AND
BENEVOLENT GENERALLY AT FIRST ACCEPTED AS VALID HER CLAIM TO BE
CONSIDERED ONE OF THEMSELVES BUT ERE LONG THE PLATING OF PRETENSION
WORE OFF THE REAL MATERIAL APPEARED BELOW AND THEY LAID HER ASIDE AS A
DECEPTION
CHAPTER XVI
IN THE COURSE OF ANOTHER FORTNIGHT I HAD SEEN SUFFICIENT OF FRANCES
EVANS HENRI TO ENABLE ME TO FORM A MORE DEFINITE OPINION OF HER
CHARACTER
I FOUND HER POSSESSED IN A SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE DEGREE OF AT
LEAST TWO GOOD POINTS VIZ PERSEVERANCE AND A SENSE OF DUTY I
FOUND SHE WAS REALLY CAPABLE OF APPLYING TO STUDY OF CONTENDING WITH
DIFFICULTIES
AT FIRST I OFFERED HER THE SAME HELP WHICH I HAD ALWAYS
FOUND IT NECESSARY TO CONFER ON THE OTHERS I BEGAN WITH UNLOOSING FOR
HER EACH KNOTTY POINT BUT I SOON DISCOVERED THAT SUCH HELP WAS REGARDED
BY MY NEW PUPIL AS DEGRADING SHE RECOILED FROM IT WITH A CERTAIN PROUD
IMPATIENCE
HEREUPON I APPOINTED HER LONG LESSONS AND LEFT HER TO SOLVE
ALONE ANY PERPLEXITIES THEY MIGHT PRESENT
SHE SET TO THE TASK WITH
SERIOUS ARDOUR AND HAVING QUICKLY ACCOMPLISHED ONE LABOUR EAGERLY
DEMANDED MORE
SO MUCH FOR HER PERSEVERANCE AS TO HER SENSE OF DUTY
IT EVINCED ITSELF THUS SHE LIKED TO LEARN BUT HATED TO TEACH HER
PROGRESS AS A PUPIL DEPENDED UPON HERSELF AND I SAW THAT ON HERSELF SHE
COULD CALCULATE WITH CERTAINTY HER SUCCESS AS A TEACHER RESTED PARTLY
PERHAPS CHIEFLY UPON THE WILL OF OTHERS IT COST HER A MOST PAINFUL
EFFORT TO ENTER INTO CONFLICT WITH THIS FOREIGN WILL TO ENDEAVOUR
TO BEND IT INTO SUBJECTION TO HER OWN FOR IN WHAT REGARDED PEOPLE IN
GENERAL THE ACTION OF HER WILL WAS IMPEDED BY MANY SCRUPLES IT WAS AS
UNEMBARRASSED AS STRONG WHERE HER OWN AFFAIRS WERE CONCERNED AND TO IT
SHE COULD AT ANY TIME SUBJECT HER INCLINATION IF THAT INCLINATION WENT
COUNTER TO HER CONVICTIONS OF RIGHT YET WHEN CALLED UPON TO WRESTLE
WITH THE PROPENSITIES THE HABITS THE FAULTS OF OTHERS OF CHILDREN
ESPECIALLY WHO ARE DEAF TO REASON AND FOR THE MOST PART INSENSATE TO
PERSUASION HER WILL SOMETIMES ALMOST REFUSED TO ACT THEN CAME IN THE
SENSE OF DUTY AND FORCED THE RELUCTANT WILL INTO OPERATION
A WASTEFUL
EXPENSE OF ENERGY AND LABOUR WAS FREQUENTLY THE CONSEQUENCE FRANCES
TOILED FOR AND WITH HER PUPILS LIKE A DRUDGE BUT IT WAS LONG ERE HER
CONSCIENTIOUS EXERTIONS WERE REWARDED BY ANYTHING LIKE DOCILITY ON THEIR
PART BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT THEY HAD POWER OVER HER INASMUCH AS BY
RESISTING HER PAINFUL ATTEMPTS TO CONVINCE PERSUADE CONTROL BY
FORCING HER TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF COERCIVE MEASURES THEY COULD
INFLICT UPON HER EXQUISITE SUFFERING
HUMAN BEINGS HUMAN CHILDREN
ESPECIALLY SELDOM DENY THEMSELVES THE PLEASURE OF EXERCISING A POWER
WHICH THEY ARE CONSCIOUS OF POSSESSING EVEN THOUGH THAT POWER CONSIST
ONLY IN A CAPACITY TO MAKE OTHERS WRETCHED A PUPIL WHOSE SENSATIONS ARE
DULLER THAN THOSE OF HIS INSTRUCTOR WHILE HIS NERVES ARE TOUGHER AND
HIS BODILY STRENGTH PERHAPS GREATER HAS AN IMMENSE ADVANTAGE OVER THAT
INSTRUCTOR AND HE WILL GENERALLY USE IT RELENTLESSLY BECAUSE THE VERY
YOUNG VERY HEALTHY VERY THOUGHTLESS KNOW NEITHER HOW TO SYMPATHIZE
NOR HOW TO SPARE
FRANCES I FEAR SUFFERED MUCH A CONTINUAL WEIGHT
SEEMED TO OPPRESS HER SPIRITS I HAVE SAID SHE DID NOT LIVE IN THE
HOUSE AND WHETHER IN HER OWN ABODE WHEREVER THAT MIGHT BE SHE WORE
THE SAME PREOCCUPIED UNSMILING SORROWFULLY RESOLVED AIR THAT ALWAYS
SHADED HER FEATURES UNDER THE ROOF OF MDLLE
REUTER I COULD NOT TELL
ONE DAY I GAVE AS A DEVOIR THE TRITE LITTLE ANECDOTE OF ALFRED TENDING
CAKES IN THE HERDSMAN'S HUT TO BE RELATED WITH AMPLIFICATIONS
A
SINGULAR AFFAIR MOST OF THE PUPILS MADE OF IT BREVITY WAS WHAT THEY
HAD CHIEFLY STUDIED THE MAJORITY OF THE NARRATIVES WERE PERFECTLY
UNINTELLIGIBLE THOSE OF SYLVIE AND LEONIE LEDRU ALONE PRETENDED TO
ANYTHING LIKE SENSE AND CONNECTION
EULALIE INDEED HAD HIT UPON A
CLEVER EXPEDIENT FOR AT ONCE ENSURING ACCURACY AND SAVING TROUBLE SHE
HAD OBTAINED ACCESS SOMEHOW TO AN ABRIDGED HISTORY OF ENGLAND AND HAD
COPIED THE ANECDOTE OUT FAIR
I WROTE ON THE MARGIN OF HER PRODUCTION
STUPID AND DECEITFUL AND THEN TORE IT DOWN THE MIDDLE
LAST IN THE PILE OF SINGLE LEAVED DEVOIRS I FOUND ONE OF SEVERAL
SHEETS NEATLY WRITTEN OUT AND STITCHED TOGETHER I KNEW THE HAND AND
SCARCELY NEEDED THE EVIDENCE OF THE SIGNATURE FRANCES EVANS HENRI TO
CONFIRM MY CONJECTURE AS TO THE WRITER'S IDENTITY
NIGHT WAS MY USUAL TIME FOR CORRECTING DEVOIRS AND MY OWN ROOM THE
USUAL SCENE OF SUCH TASK TASK MOST ONEROUS HITHERTO AND IT SEEMED
STRANGE TO ME TO FEEL RISING WITHIN ME AN INCIPIENT SENSE OF INTEREST
AS I SNUFFED THE CANDLE AND ADDRESSED MYSELF TO THE PERUSAL OF THE POOR
TEACHER'S MANUSCRIPT
NOW THOUGHT I I SHALL SEE A GLIMPSE OF WHAT SHE REALLY IS I SHALL
GET AN IDEA OF THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF HER POWERS NOT THAT SHE CAN BE
EXPECTED TO EXPRESS HERSELF WELL IN A FOREIGN TONGUE BUT STILL IF SHE
HAS ANY MIND HERE WILL BE A REFLECTION OF IT
THE NARRATIVE COMMENCED BY A DESCRIPTION OF A SAXON PEASANT'S HUT
SITUATED WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A GREAT LEAFLESS WINTER FOREST IT
REPRESENTED AN EVENING IN DECEMBER FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FALLING AND
THE HERDSMAN FORETOLD A HEAVY STORM HE SUMMONED HIS WIFE TO AID HIM IN
COLLECTING THEIR FLOCK ROAMING FAR AWAY ON THE PASTORAL BANKS OF THE
THONE HE WARNS HER THAT IT WILL BE LATE ERE THEY RETURN
THE GOOD WOMAN
IS RELUCTANT TO QUIT HER OCCUPATION OF BAKING CAKES FOR THE EVENING
MEAL BUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE PRIMARY IMPORTANCE OF SECURING THE HERDS AND
FLOCKS SHE PUTS ON HER SHEEP SKIN MANTLE AND ADDRESSING A STRANGER
WHO RESTS HALF RECLINED ON A BED OF RUSHES NEAR THE HEARTH BIDS HIM
MIND THE BREAD TILL HER RETURN
TAKE CARE YOUNG MAN SHE CONTINUES THAT YOU FASTEN THE DOOR WELL
AFTER US AND ABOVE ALL OPEN TO NONE IN OUR ABSENCE WHATEVER SOUND
YOU HEAR STIR NOT AND LOOK NOT OUT
THE NIGHT WILL SOON FALL THIS
FOREST IS MOST WILD AND LONELY STRANGE NOISES ARE OFTEN HEARD THEREIN
AFTER SUNSET WOLVES HAUNT THESE GLADES AND DANISH WARRIORS INFEST THE
COUNTRY WORSE THINGS ARE TALKED OF YOU MIGHT CHANCE TO HEAR AS IT
WERE A CHILD CRY AND ON OPENING THE DOOR TO AFFORD IT SUCCOUR A GREET
BLACK BULL OR A SHADOWY GOBLIN DOG MIGHT RUSH OVER THE THRESHOLD
OR MORE AWFUL STILL IF SOMETHING FLAPPED AS WITH WINGS AGAINST THE
LATTICE AND THEN A RAVEN OR A WHITE DOVE FLEW IN AND SETTLED ON THE
HEARTH SUCH A VISITOR WOULD BE A SURE SIGN OF MISFORTUNE TO THE HOUSE
THEREFORE HEED MY ADVICE AND LIFT THE LATCHET FOR NOTHING
HER HUSBAND CALLS HER AWAY BOTH DEPART
THE STRANGER LEFT ALONE
LISTENS AWHILE TO THE MUFFLED SNOW WIND THE REMOTE SWOLLEN SOUND OF
THE RIVER AND THEN HE SPEAKS
IT IS CHRISTMAS EVE SAYS HE I MARK THE DATE HERE I SIT ALONE ON
A RUDE COUCH OF RUSHES SHELTERED BY THE THATCH OF A HERDSMAN'S HUT
I WHOSE INHERITANCE WAS A KINGDOM OWE MY NIGHT'S HARBOURAGE TO A POOR
SERF MY THRONE IS USURPED MY CROWN PRESSES THE BROW OF AN INVADER I
HAVE NO FRIENDS MY TROOPS WANDER BROKEN IN THE HILLS OF WALES RECKLESS
ROBBERS SPOIL MY COUNTRY MY SUBJECTS LIE PROSTRATE THEIR BREASTS
CRUSHED BY THE HEEL OF THE BRUTAL DANE
FATE THOU HAST DONE THY WORST
AND NOW THOU STANDEST BEFORE ME RESTING THY HAND ON THY BLUNTED BLADE
AY I SEE THINE EYE CONFRONT MINE AND DEMAND WHY I STILL LIVE WHY I
STILL HOPE
PAGAN DEMON I CREDIT NOT THINE OMNIPOTENCE AND SO CANNOT
SUCCUMB TO THY POWER
MY GOD WHOSE SON AS ON THIS NIGHT TOOK ON HIM
THE FORM OF MAN AND FOR MAN VOUCHSAFED TO SUFFER AND BLEED CONTROLS
THY HAND AND WITHOUT HIS BEHEST THOU CANST NOT STRIKE A STROKE
MY GOD
IS SINLESS ETERNAL ALL WISE IN HIM IS MY TRUST AND THOUGH STRIPPED
AND CRUSHED BY THEE THOUGH NAKED DESOLATE VOID OF RESOURCE I DO NOT
DESPAIR I CANNOT DESPAIR WERE THE LANCE OF GUTHRUM NOW WET WITH MY
BLOOD I SHOULD NOT DESPAIR
I WATCH I TOIL I HOPE I PRAY JEHOVAH
IN HIS OWN TIME WILL AID
I NEED NOT CONTINUE THE QUOTATION THE WHOLE DEVOIR WAS IN THE SAME
STRAIN
THERE WERE ERRORS OF ORTHOGRAPHY THERE WERE FOREIGN IDIOMS
THERE WERE SOME FAULTS OF CONSTRUCTION THERE WERE VERBS IRREGULAR
TRANSFORMED INTO VERBS REGULAR IT WAS MOSTLY MADE UP AS THE ABOVE
EXAMPLE SHOWS OF SHORT AND SOMEWHAT RUDE SENTENCES AND THE STYLE STOOD
IN GREAT NEED OF POLISH AND SUSTAINED DIGNITY YET SUCH AS IT WAS I
HAD HITHERTO SEEN NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE COURSE OF MY PROFESSORIAL
EXPERIENCE
THE GIRL'S MIND HAD CONCEIVED A PICTURE OF THE HUT OF THE
TWO PEASANTS OF THE CROWNLESS KING SHE HAD IMAGINED THE WINTRY FOREST
SHE HAD RECALLED THE OLD SAXON GHOST LEGENDS SHE HAD APPRECIATED
ALFRED'S COURAGE UNDER CALAMITY SHE HAD REMEMBERED HIS CHRISTIAN
EDUCATION AND HAD SHOWN HIM WITH THE ROOTED CONFIDENCE OF THOSE
PRIMITIVE DAYS RELYING ON THE SCRIPTURAL JEHOVAH FOR AID AGAINST THE
MYTHOLOGICAL DESTINY
THIS SHE HAD DONE WITHOUT A HINT FROM ME I HAD
GIVEN THE SUBJECT BUT NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT THE MANNER OF TREATING IT
I WILL FIND OR MAKE AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO HER I SAID TO
MYSELF AS I ROLLED THE DEVOIR UP I WILL LEARN WHAT SHE HAS OF ENGLISH
IN HER BESIDES THE NAME OF FRANCES EVANS SHE IS NO NOVICE IN THE
LANGUAGE THAT IS EVIDENT YET SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD NEITHER BEEN IN
ENGLAND NOR TAKEN LESSONS IN ENGLISH NOR LIVED IN ENGLISH FAMILIES
IN THE COURSE OF MY NEXT LESSON I MADE A REPORT OF THE OTHER DEVOIRS
DEALING OUT PRAISE AND BLAME IN VERY SMALL RETAIL PARCELS ACCORDING TO
MY CUSTOM FOR THERE WAS NO USE IN BLAMING SEVERELY AND HIGH ENCOMIUMS
WERE RARELY MERITED
I SAID NOTHING OF MDLLE
HENRI'S EXERCISE AND
SPECTACLES ON NOSE I ENDEAVOURED TO DECIPHER IN HER COUNTENANCE HER
SENTIMENTS AT THE OMISSION
I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHETHER IN HER EXISTED
A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER OWN TALENTS
IF SHE THINKS SHE DID A CLEVER
THING IN COMPOSING THAT DEVOIR SHE WILL NOW LOOK MORTIFIED THOUGHT
I
GRAVE AS USUAL ALMOST SOMBRE WAS HER FACE AS USUAL HER EYES WERE
FASTENED ON THE CAHIER OPEN BEFORE HER THERE WAS SOMETHING I THOUGHT
OF EXPECTATION IN HER ATTITUDE AS I CONCLUDED A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE
LAST DEVOIR AND WHEN CASTING IT FROM ME AND RUBBING MY HANDS I BADE
THEM TAKE THEIR GRAMMARS SOME SLIGHT CHANGE DID PASS OVER HER AIR
AND MIEN AS THOUGH SHE NOW RELINQUISHED A FAINT PROSPECT OF PLEASANT
EXCITEMENT SHE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO BE DISCUSSED IN WHICH
SHE HAD A DEGREE OF INTEREST THE DISCUSSION WAS NOT TO COME ON SO
EXPECTATION SANK BACK SHRUNK AND SAD BUT ATTENTION PROMPTLY FILLING
UP THE VOID REPAIRED IN A MOMENT THE TRANSIENT COLLAPSE OF FEATURE
STILL I FELT RATHER THAN SAW DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE LESSON
THAT A HOPE HAD BEEN WRENCHED FROM HER AND THAT IF SHE DID NOT SHOW
DISTRESS IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT
AT FOUR O'CLOCK WHEN THE BELL RANG AND THE ROOM WAS IN IMMEDIATE
TUMULT INSTEAD OF TAKING MY HAT AND STARTING FROM THE ESTRADE I SAT
STILL A MOMENT
I LOOKED AT FRANCES SHE WAS PUTTING HER BOOKS INTO HER
CABAS HAVING FASTENED THE BUTTON SHE RAISED HER HEAD ENCOUNTERING MY
EYE SHE MADE A QUIET RESPECTFUL OBEISANCE AS BIDDING GOOD AFTERNOON
AND WAS TURNING TO DEPART
COME HERE SAID I LIFTING MY FINGER AT THE SAME TIME
SHE HESITATED
SHE COULD NOT HEAR THE WORDS AMIDST THE UPROAR NOW PERVADING BOTH
SCHOOL ROOMS I REPEATED THE SIGN SHE APPROACHED AGAIN SHE PAUSED
WITHIN HALF A YARD OF THE ESTRADE AND LOOKED SHY AND STILL DOUBTFUL
WHETHER SHE HAD MISTAKEN MY MEANING
STEP UP I SAID SPEAKING WITH DECISION
IT IS THE ONLY WAY OF DEALING
WITH DIFFIDENT EASILY EMBARRASSED CHARACTERS AND WITH SOME SLIGHT
MANUAL AID I PRESENTLY GOT HER PLACED JUST WHERE I WANTED HER TO BE
THAT IS BETWEEN MY DESK AND THE WINDOW WHERE SHE WAS SCREENED FROM THE
RUSH OF THE SECOND DIVISION AND WHERE NO ONE COULD SNEAK BEHIND HER TO
LISTEN
TAKE A SEAT I SAID PLACING A TABOURET AND I MADE HER SIT DOWN
I
KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING WOULD BE CONSIDERED A VERY STRANGE THING AND
WHAT WAS MORE I DID NOT CARE
FRANCES KNEW IT ALSO AND I FEAR BY AN
APPEARANCE OF AGITATION AND TREMBLING THAT SHE CARED MUCH
I DREW FROM
MY POCKET THE ROLLED UP DEVOIR
THIS IS YOURS I SUPPOSE SAID I ADDRESSING HER IN ENGLISH FOR I NOW
FELT SURE SHE COULD SPEAK ENGLISH
YES SHE ANSWERED DISTINCTLY AND AS I UNROLLED IT AND LAID IT OUT
FLAT ON THE DESK BEFORE HER WITH MY HAND UPON IT AND A PENCIL IN THAT
HAND I SAW HER MOVED AND AS IT WERE KINDLED HER DEPRESSION BEAMED
AS A CLOUD MIGHT BEHIND WHICH THE SUN IS BURNING
THIS DEVOIR HAS NUMEROUS FAULTS SAID I
IT WILL TAKE YOU SOME YEARS
OF CAREFUL STUDY BEFORE YOU ARE IN A CONDITION TO WRITE ENGLISH WITH
ABSOLUTE CORRECTNESS
ATTEND I WILL POINT OUT SOME PRINCIPAL DEFECTS
AND I WENT THROUGH IT CAREFULLY NOTING EVERY ERROR AND DEMONSTRATING
WHY THEY WERE ERRORS AND HOW THE WORDS OR PHRASES OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
WRITTEN
IN THE COURSE OF THIS SOBERING PROCESS SHE BECAME CALM
I NOW
WENT ON
AS TO THE SUBSTANCE OF YOUR DEVOIR MDLLE
HENRI IT HAS SURPRISED ME
I PERUSED IT WITH PLEASURE BECAUSE I SAW IN IT SOME PROOFS OF TASTE AND
FANCY
TASTE AND FANCY ARE NOT THE HIGHEST GIFTS OF THE HUMAN MIND BUT
SUCH AS THEY ARE YOU POSSESS THEM NOT PROBABLY IN A PARAMOUNT DEGREE
BUT IN A DEGREE BEYOND WHAT THE MAJORITY CAN BOAST
YOU MAY THEN TAKE
COURAGE CULTIVATE THE FACULTIES THAT GOD AND NATURE HAVE BESTOWED ON
YOU AND DO NOT FEAR IN ANY CRISIS OF SUFFERING UNDER ANY PRESSURE OF
INJUSTICE TO DERIVE FREE AND FULL CONSOLATION FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
THEIR STRENGTH AND RARITY
STRENGTH AND RARITY I REPEATED TO MYSELF AY THE WORDS ARE PROBABLY
TRUE FOR ON LOOKING UP I SAW THE SUN HAD DISSEVERED ITS SCREENING
CLOUD HER COUNTENANCE WAS TRANSFIGURED A SMILE SHONE IN HER EYES A
SMILE ALMOST TRIUMPHANT IT SEEMED TO SAY
I AM GLAD YOU HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DISCOVER SO MUCH OF MY NATURE YOU
NEED NOT SO CAREFULLY MODERATE YOUR LANGUAGE
DO YOU THINK I AM MYSELF A
STRANGER TO MYSELF WHAT YOU TELL ME IN TERMS SO QUALIFIED I HAVE KNOWN
FULLY FROM A CHILD
SHE DID SAY THIS AS PLAINLY AS A FRANK AND FLASHING GLANCE COULD BUT
IN A MOMENT THE GLOW OF HER COMPLEXION THE RADIANCE OF HER ASPECT
HAD SUBSIDED IF STRONGLY CONSCIOUS OF HER TALENTS SHE WAS EQUALLY
CONSCIOUS OF HER HARASSING DEFECTS AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF THESE
OBLITERATED FOR A SINGLE SECOND NOW REVIVING WITH SUDDEN FORCE AT ONCE
SUBDUED THE TOO VIVID CHARACTERS IN WHICH HER SENSE OF HER POWERS HAD
BEEN EXPRESSED
SO QUICK WAS THE REVULSION OF FEELING I HAD NOT TIME TO
CHECK HER TRIUMPH BY REPROOF ERE I COULD CONTRACT MY BROWS TO A FROWN
SHE HAD BECOME SERIOUS AND ALMOST MOURNFUL LOOKING
THANK YOU SIR SAID SHE RISING
THERE WAS GRATITUDE BOTH IN HER
VOICE AND IN THE LOOK WITH WHICH SHE ACCOMPANIED IT
IT WAS TIME
INDEED FOR OUR CONFERENCE TO TERMINATE FOR WHEN I GLANCED AROUND
BEHOLD ALL THE BOARDERS THE DAY SCHOLARS HAD DEPARTED WERE CONGREGATED
WITHIN A YARD OR TWO OF MY DESK AND STOOD STARING WITH EYES AND MOUTHS
WIDE OPEN THE THREE MAITRESSES FORMED A WHISPERING KNOT IN ONE CORNER
AND CLOSE AT MY ELBOW WAS THE DIRECTRESS SITTING ON A LOW CHAIR
CALMLY CLIPPING THE TASSELS OF HER FINISHED PURSE
CHAPTER XVII
AFTER ALL I HAD PROFITED BUT IMPERFECTLY BY THE OPPORTUNITY I HAD SO
BOLDLY ACHIEVED OF SPEAKING TO MDLLE
HENRI IT WAS MY INTENTION TO ASK
HER HOW SHE CAME TO BE POSSESSED OF TWO ENGLISH BAPTISMAL NAMES FRANCES
AND EVANS IN ADDITION TO HER FRENCH SURNAME ALSO WHENCE SHE DERIVED
HER GOOD ACCENT
I HAD FORGOTTEN BOTH POINTS OR RATHER OUR COLLOQUY
HAD BEEN SO BRIEF THAT I HAD NOT HAD TIME TO BRING THEM FORWARD
MOREOVER I HAD NOT HALF TESTED HER POWERS OF SPEAKING ENGLISH ALL I
HAD DRAWN FROM HER IN THAT LANGUAGE WERE THE WORDS YES AND THANK
YOU SIR NO MATTER I REFLECTED
WHAT HAS BEEN LEFT INCOMPLETE NOW
SHALL BE FINISHED ANOTHER DAY NOR DID I FAIL TO KEEP THE PROMISE THUS
MADE TO MYSELF
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET EVEN A FEW WORDS OF PARTICULAR
CONVERSATION WITH ONE PUPIL AMONG SO MANY BUT ACCORDING TO THE OLD
PROVERB WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
I MANAGED TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EXCHANGING A FEW WORDS WITH MDLLE
HENRI REGARDLESS THAT ENVY STARED AND DETRACTION WHISPERED WHENEVER I
APPROACHED HER
YOUR BOOK AN INSTANT SUCH WAS THE MODE IN WHICH I OFTEN BEGAN THESE
BRIEF DIALOGUES THE TIME WAS ALWAYS JUST AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE
LESSON AND MOTIONING TO HER TO RISE I INSTALLED MYSELF IN HER PLACE
ALLOWING HER TO STAND DEFERENTIALLY AT MY SIDE FOR I ESTEEMED IT WISE
AND RIGHT IN HER CASE TO ENFORCE STRICTLY ALL FORMS ORDINARILY IN
USE BETWEEN MASTER AND PUPIL THE RATHER BECAUSE I PERCEIVED THAT IN
PROPORTION AS MY MANNER GREW AUSTERE AND MAGISTERIAL HERS BECAME EASY
AND SELF POSSESSED AN ODD CONTRADICTION DOUBTLESS TO THE ORDINARY
EFFECT IN SUCH CASES BUT SO IT WAS
A PENCIL SAID I HOLDING OUT MY HAND WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER
I AM
NOW ABOUT TO SKETCH A BRIEF REPORT OF THE FIRST OF THESE CONFERENCES
SHE GAVE ME ONE AND WHILE I UNDERLINED SOME ERRORS IN A GRAMMATICAL
EXERCISE SHE HAD WRITTEN I OBSERVED
YOU ARE NOT A NATIVE OF BELGIUM
NO
NOR OF FRANCE
NO
WHERE THEN IS YOUR BIRTHPLACE
I WAS BORN AT GENEVA
YOU DON'T CALL FRANCES AND EVANS SWISS NAMES I PRESUME
NO SIR THEY ARE ENGLISH NAMES
JUST SO AND IS IT THE CUSTOM OF THE GENEVESE TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN
ENGLISH APPELLATIVES
NON MONSIEUR MAIS
SPEAK ENGLISH IF YOU PLEASE
MAIS
ENGLISH
BUT SLOWLY AND WITH EMBARRASSMENT MY PARENTS WERE NOT ALL THE TWO
GENEVESE
SAY BOTH INSTEAD OF 'ALL THE TWO MADEMOISELLE
NOT BOTH SWISS MY MOTHER WAS ENGLISH
AH AND OF ENGLISH EXTRACTION
YES HER ANCESTORS WERE ALL ENGLISH
AND YOUR FATHER
HE WAS SWISS
WHAT BESIDES WHAT WAS HIS PROFESSION
ECCLESIASTIC PASTOR HE HAD A CHURCH
SINCE YOUR MOTHER IS AN ENGLISHWOMAN WHY DO YOU NOT SPEAK ENGLISH WITH
MORE FACILITY
MAMAN EST MORTE IL Y A DIX ANS
AND YOU DO HOMAGE TO HER MEMORY BY FORGETTING HER LANGUAGE
HAVE THE
GOODNESS TO PUT FRENCH OUT OF YOUR MIND SO LONG AS I CONVERSE WITH
YOU KEEP TO ENGLISH
C'EST SI DIFFICILE MONSIEUR QUAND ON N'EN A PLUS L'HABITUDE
YOU HAD THE HABITUDE FORMERLY I SUPPOSE NOW ANSWER ME IN YOUR MOTHER
TONGUE
YES SIR I SPOKE THE ENGLISH MORE THAN THE FRENCH WHEN I WAS A CHILD
WHY DO YOU NOT SPEAK IT NOW
BECAUSE I HAVE NO ENGLISH FRIENDS
YOU LIVE WITH YOUR FATHER I SUPPOSE
MY FATHER IS DEAD
YOU HAVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
NOT ONE
DO YOU LIVE ALONE
NO I HAVE AN AUNT MA TANTE JULIENNE
YOUR FATHER'S SISTER
JUSTEMENT MONSIEUR
IS THAT ENGLISH
NO BUT I FORGET
FOR WHICH MADEMOISELLE IF YOU WERE A CHILD I SHOULD CERTAINLY DEVISE
SOME SLIGHT PUNISHMENT AT YOUR AGE YOU MUST BE TWO OR THREE AND
TWENTY I SHOULD THINK
PAS ENCORE MONSIEUR EN UN MOIS J'AURAI DIX NEUF ANS
WELL NINETEEN IS A MATURE AGE AND HAVING ATTAINED IT YOU OUGHT TO
BE SO SOLICITOUS FOR YOUR OWN IMPROVEMENT THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE NEEDFUL
FOR A MASTER TO REMIND YOU TWICE OF THE EXPEDIENCY OF YOUR SPEAKING
ENGLISH WHENEVER PRACTICABLE
TO THIS WISE SPEECH I RECEIVED NO ANSWER AND WHEN I LOOKED UP MY
PUPIL WAS SMILING TO HERSELF A MUCH MEANING THOUGH NOT VERY GAY SMILE
IT SEEMED TO SAY HE TALKS OF HE KNOWS NOT WHAT IT SAID THIS
SO PLAINLY THAT I DETERMINED TO REQUEST INFORMATION ON THE POINT
CONCERNING WHICH MY IGNORANCE SEEMED TO BE THUS TACITLY AFFIRMED
ARE YOU SOLICITOUS FOR YOUR OWN IMPROVEMENT
RATHER
HOW DO YOU PROVE IT MADEMOISELLE
AN ODD QUESTION AND BLUNTLY PUT IT EXCITED A SECOND SMILE
WHY MONSIEUR I AM NOT INATTENTIVE AM I I LEARN MY LESSONS WELL
OH A CHILD CAN DO THAT AND WHAT MORE DO YOU DO
WHAT MORE CAN I DO
OH CERTAINLY NOT MUCH BUT YOU ARE A TEACHER ARE YOU NOT AS WELL AS
A PUPIL
YES
YOU TEACH LACE MENDING
YES
A DULL STUPID OCCUPATION DO YOU LIKE IT
NO IT IS TEDIOUS
WHY DO YOU PURSUE IT WHY DO YOU NOT RATHER TEACH HISTORY GEOGRAPHY
GRAMMAR EVEN ARITHMETIC
IS MONSIEUR CERTAIN THAT I AM MYSELF THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THESE
STUDIES
I DON'T KNOW YOU OUGHT TO BE AT YOUR AGE
BUT I NEVER WAS AT SCHOOL MONSIEUR
INDEED WHAT THEN WERE YOUR FRIENDS WHAT WAS YOUR AUNT ABOUT SHE IS
VERY MUCH TO BLAME
NO MONSIEUR NO MY AUNT IS GOOD SHE IS NOT TO BLAME SHE DOES WHAT
SHE CAN SHE LODGES AND NOURISHES ME I REPORT MDLLE
HENRI'S PHRASES
LITERALLY AND IT WAS THUS SHE TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH
SHE IS NOT
RICH SHE HAS ONLY AN ANNUITY OF TWELVE HUNDRED FRANCS AND IT WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO SEND ME TO SCHOOL
RATHER THOUGHT I TO MYSELF ON HEARING THIS BUT I CONTINUED IN THE
DOGMATICAL TONE I HAD ADOPTED
IT IS SAD HOWEVER THAT YOU SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP IN IGNORANCE OF THE
MOST ORDINARY BRANCHES OF EDUCATION HAD YOU KNOWN SOMETHING OF HISTORY
AND GRAMMAR YOU MIGHT BY DEGREES HAVE RELINQUISHED YOUR LACE MENDING
DRUDGERY AND RISEN IN THE WORLD
IT IS WHAT I MEAN TO DO
HOW BY A KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH ALONE THAT WILL NOT SUFFICE NO
RESPECTABLE FAMILY WILL RECEIVE A GOVERNESS WHOSE WHOLE STOCK OF
KNOWLEDGE CONSISTS IN A FAMILIARITY WITH ONE FOREIGN LANGUAGE
MONSIEUR I KNOW OTHER THINGS
YES YES YOU CAN WORK WITH BERLIN WOOLS AND EMBROIDER HANDKERCHIEFS
AND COLLARS THAT WILL DO LITTLE FOR YOU
MDLLE
HENRI'S LIPS WERE UNCLOSED TO ANSWER BUT SHE CHECKED HERSELF
AS THINKING THE DISCUSSION HAD BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PURSUED AND REMAINED
SILENT
SPEAK I CONTINUED IMPATIENTLY I NEVER LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF
ACQUIESCENCE WHEN THE REALITY IS NOT THERE AND YOU HAD A CONTRADICTION
AT YOUR TONGUE'S END
MONSIEUR I HAVE HAD MANY LESSONS BOTH IN GRAMMAR HISTORY GEOGRAPHY
AND ARITHMETIC
I HAVE GONE THROUGH A COURSE OF EACH STUDY
BRAVO BUT HOW DID YOU MANAGE IT SINCE YOUR AUNT COULD NOT AFFORD TO
SEND YOU TO SCHOOL
BY LACE MENDING BY THE THING MONSIEUR DESPISES SO MUCH
TRULY AND NOW MADEMOISELLE IT WILL BE A GOOD EXERCISE FOR YOU TO
EXPLAIN TO ME IN ENGLISH HOW SUCH A RESULT WAS PRODUCED BY SUCH MEANS
MONSIEUR I BEGGED MY AUNT TO HAVE ME TAUGHT LACE MENDING SOON AFTER
WE CAME TO BRUSSELS BECAUSE I KNEW IT WAS A METIER A TRADE WHICH WAS
EASILY LEARNT AND BY WHICH I COULD EARN SOME MONEY VERY SOON
I LEARNT
IT IN A FEW DAYS AND I QUICKLY GOT WORK FOR ALL THE BRUSSELS LADIES
HAVE OLD LACE VERY PRECIOUS WHICH MUST BE MENDED ALL THE TIMES IT IS
WASHED
I EARNED MONEY A LITTLE AND THIS MONEY I GRAVE FOR LESSONS
IN THE STUDIES I HAVE MENTIONED SOME OF IT I SPENT IN BUYING BOOKS
ENGLISH BOOKS ESPECIALLY SOON I SHALL TRY TO FIND A PLACE OF GOVERNESS
OR SCHOOL TEACHER WHEN I CAN WRITE AND SPEAK ENGLISH WELL BUT IT WILL
BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THOSE WHO KNOW I HAVE BEEN A LACE MENDER WILL
DESPISE ME AS THE PUPILS HERE DESPISE ME
POURTANT J'AI MON PROJET
SHE ADDED IN A LOWER TONE
WHAT IS IT
I WILL GO AND LIVE IN ENGLAND I WILL TEACH FRENCH THERE
THE WORDS WERE PRONOUNCED EMPHATICALLY
SHE SAID ENGLAND AS YOU MIGHT
SUPPOSE AN ISRAELITE OF MOSES' DAYS WOULD HAVE SAID CANAAN
HAVE YOU A WISH TO SEE ENGLAND
YES AND AN INTENTION
AND HERE A VOICE THE VOICE OF THE DIRECTRESS INTERPOSED
MADEMOISELLE HENRI JE CROIS QU'IL VA PLEUVOIR VOUS FERIEZ BIEN MA
BONNE AMIE DE RETOURNER CHEZ VOUS TOUT DE SUITE
IN SILENCE WITHOUT A WORD OF THANKS FOR THIS OFFICIOUS WARNING MDLLE
HENRI COLLECTED HER BOOKS SHE MOVED TO ME RESPECTFULLY ENDEAVOURED TO
MOVE TO HER SUPERIOR THOUGH THE ENDEAVOUR WAS ALMOST A FAILURE FOR HER
HEAD SEEMED AS IF IT WOULD NOT BEND AND THUS DEPARTED
WHERE THERE IS ONE GRAIN OF PERSEVERANCE OR WILFULNESS IN THE
COMPOSITION TRIFLING OBSTACLES ARE EVER KNOWN RATHER TO STIMULATE THAN
DISCOURAGE
MDLLE
REUTER MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SPARED HERSELF THE TROUBLE
OF GIVING THAT INTIMATION ABOUT THE WEATHER BY THE BY HER PREDICTION
WAS FALSIFIED BY THE EVENT IT DID NOT RAIN THAT EVENING
AT THE CLOSE
OF THE NEXT LESSON I WAS AGAIN AT MDLLE
HENRI'S DESK
THUS DID I ACCOST
HER
WHAT IS YOUR IDEA OF ENGLAND MADEMOISELLE WHY DO YOU WISH TO GO
THERE
ACCUSTOMED BY THIS TIME TO THE CALCULATED ABRUPTNESS OF MY MANNER IT NO
LONGER DISCOMPOSED OR SURPRISED HER AND SHE ANSWERED WITH ONLY SO
MUCH OF HESITATION AS WAS RENDERED INEVITABLE BY THE DIFFICULTY SHE
EXPERIENCED IN IMPROVISING THE TRANSLATION OF HER THOUGHTS FROM FRENCH
TO ENGLISH
ENGLAND IS SOMETHING UNIQUE AS I HAVE HEARD AND READ MY IDEA OF IT IS
VAGUE AND I WANT TO GO THERE TO RENDER MY IDEA CLEAR DEFINITE
HUM HOW MUCH OF ENGLAND DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU COULD SEE IF YOU WENT THERE
IN THE CAPACITY OF A TEACHER A STRANGE NOTION YOU MUST HAVE OF GETTING
A CLEAR AND DEFINITE IDEA OF A COUNTRY ALL YOU COULD SEE OF GREAT
BRITAIN WOULD BE THE INTERIOR OF A SCHOOL OR AT MOST OF ONE OR TWO
PRIVATE DWELLINGS
IT WOULD BE AN ENGLISH SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE ENGLISH DWELLINGS
INDISPUTABLY BUT WHAT THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE VALUE OF OBSERVATIONS
MADE ON A SCALE SO NARROW
MONSIEUR MIGHT NOT ONE LEARN SOMETHING BY ANALOGY
AN ECHANTILLON A A SAMPLE OFTEN SERVES TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THE WHOLE
BESIDES NARROW AND WIDE ARE WORDS COMPARATIVE ARE THEY NOT ALL MY
LIFE WOULD PERHAPS SEEM NARROW IN YOUR EYES ALL THE LIFE OF A THAT
LITTLE ANIMAL SUBTERRANEAN UNE TAUPE COMMENT DIT ON
MOLE
YES A MOLE WHICH LIVES UNDERGROUND WOULD SEEM NARROW EVEN TO ME
WELL MADEMOISELLE WHAT THEN PROCEED
MAIS MONSIEUR VOUS ME COMPRENEZ
NOT IN THE LEAST HAVE THE GOODNESS TO EXPLAIN
WHY MONSIEUR IT IS JUST SO
IN SWITZERLAND I HAVE DONE BUT LITTLE
LEARNT BUT LITTLE AND SEEN BUT LITTLE MY LIFE THERE WAS IN A CIRCLE
I WALKED THE SAME ROUND EVERY DAY I COULD NOT GET OUT OF IT HAD I
RESTED REMAINED THERE EVEN TILL MY DEATH I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ENLARGED
IT BECAUSE I AM POOR AND NOT SKILFUL I HAVE NOT GREAT ACQUIREMENTS
WHEN I WAS QUITE TIRED OF THIS ROUND I BEGGED MY AUNT TO GO TO
BRUSSELS MY EXISTENCE IS NO LARGER HERE BECAUSE I AM NO RICHER OR
HIGHER I WALK IN AS NARROW A LIMIT BUT THE SCENE IS CHANGED IT WOULD
CHANGE AGAIN IF I WENT TO ENGLAND
I KNEW SOMETHING OF THE BOURGEOIS OF
GENEVA NOW I KNOW SOMETHING OF THE BOURGEOIS OF BRUSSELS IF I WENT TO
LONDON I WOULD KNOW SOMETHING OF THE BOURGEOIS OF LONDON
CAN YOU MAKE
ANY SENSE OUT OF WHAT I SAY MONSIEUR OR IS IT ALL OBSCURE
I SEE I SEE NOW LET US ADVERT TO ANOTHER SUBJECT YOU PROPOSE TO
DEVOTE YOUR LIFE TO TEACHING AND YOU ARE A MOST UNSUCCESSFUL TEACHER
YOU CANNOT KEEP YOUR PUPILS IN ORDER
A FLUSH OF PAINFUL CONFUSION WAS THE RESULT OF THIS HARSH REMARK SHE
BENT HER HEAD TO THE DESK BUT SOON RAISING IT REPLIED
MONSIEUR I AM NOT A SKILFUL TEACHER IT IS TRUE BUT PRACTICE
IMPROVES BESIDES I WORK UNDER DIFFICULTIES HERE I ONLY TEACH SEWING
I CAN SHOW NO POWER IN SEWING NO SUPERIORITY IT IS A SUBORDINATE
ART THEN I HAVE NO ASSOCIATES IN THIS HOUSE I AM ISOLATED I AM TOO A
HERETIC WHICH DEPRIVES ME OF INFLUENCE
AND IN ENGLAND YOU WOULD BE A FOREIGNER THAT TOO WOULD DEPRIVE YOU
OF INFLUENCE AND WOULD EFFECTUALLY SEPARATE YOU FROM ALL ROUND YOU IN
ENGLAND YOU WOULD HAVE AS FEW CONNECTIONS AS LITTLE IMPORTANCE AS YOU
HAVE HERE
BUT I SHOULD BE LEARNING SOMETHING FOR THE REST THERE ARE PROBABLY
DIFFICULTIES FOR SUCH AS I EVERYWHERE AND IF I MUST CONTEND AND
PERHAPS BE CONQUERED I WOULD RATHER SUBMIT TO ENGLISH PRIDE THAN TO
FLEMISH COARSENESS BESIDES MONSIEUR
SHE STOPPED NOT EVIDENTLY FROM ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING WORDS TO
EXPRESS HERSELF BUT BECAUSE DISCRETION SEEMED TO SAY YOU HAVE SAID
ENOUGH
FINISH YOUR PHRASE I URGED
BESIDES MONSIEUR I LONG TO LIVE ONCE MORE AMONG PROTESTANTS THEY ARE
MORE HONEST THAN CATHOLICS A ROMISH SCHOOL IS A BUILDING WITH POROUS
WALLS A HOLLOW FLOOR A FALSE CEILING EVERY ROOM IN THIS HOUSE
MONSIEUR HAS EYEHOLES AND EAR HOLES AND WHAT THE HOUSE IS THE
INHABITANTS ARE VERY TREACHEROUS THEY ALL THINK IT LAWFUL TO TELL
LIES THEY ALL CALL IT POLITENESS TO PROFESS FRIENDSHIP WHERE THEY FEEL
HATRED
ALL SAID I YOU MEAN THE PUPILS THE MERE CHILDREN INEXPERIENCED
GIDDY THINGS WHO HAVE NOT LEARNT TO DISTINGUISH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
RIGHT AND WRONG
ON THE CONTRARY MONSIEUR THE CHILDREN ARE THE MOST SINCERE THEY HAVE
NOT YET HAD TIME TO BECOME ACCOMPLISHED IN DUPLICITY THEY WILL TELL
LIES BUT THEY DO IT INARTIFICIALLY AND YOU KNOW THEY ARE LYING BUT
THE GROWN UP PEOPLE ARE VERY FALSE THEY DECEIVE STRANGERS THEY DECEIVE
EACH OTHER
A SERVANT HERE ENTERED
MDLLE
HENRI MDLLE
REUTER VOUS PRIE DE VOULOIR BIEN CONDUIRE LA
PETITE DE DORLODOT CHEZ ELLE ELLE VOUS ATTEND DANS LE CABINET
DE ROSALIE LA PORTIERE C'EST QUE SA BONNE N'EST PAS VENUE LA
CHERCHER VOYEZ VOUS
EH BIEN EST CE QUE JE SUIS SA BONNE MOI DEMANDED MDLLE
HENRI THEN
SMILING WITH THAT SAME BITTER DERISIVE SMILE I HAD SEEN ON HER LIPS
ONCE BEFORE SHE HASTILY ROSE AND MADE HER EXIT
CHAPTER XVIII
THE YOUNG ANGLO SWISS EVIDENTLY DERIVED BOTH PLEASURE AND PROFIT FROM
THE STUDY OF HER MOTHER TONGUE
IN TEACHING HER I DID NOT OF COURSE
CONFINE MYSELF TO THE ORDINARY SCHOOL ROUTINE I MADE INSTRUCTION IN
ENGLISH A CHANNEL FOR INSTRUCTION IN LITERATURE
I PRESCRIBED TO HER A
COURSE OF READING SHE HAD A LITTLE SELECTION OF ENGLISH CLASSICS A
FEW OF WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT HER BY HER MOTHER AND THE OTHERS SHE HAD
PURCHASED WITH HER OWN PENNY FEE
I LENT HER SOME MORE MODERN WORKS ALL
THESE SHE READ WITH AVIDITY GIVING ME IN WRITING A CLEAR SUMMARY OF
EACH WORK WHEN SHE HAD PERUSED IT
COMPOSITION TOO SHE DELIGHTED IN
SUCH OCCUPATION SEEMED THE VERY BREATH OF HER NOSTRILS AND SOON HER
IMPROVED PRODUCTIONS WRUNG FROM ME THE AVOWAL THAT THOSE QUALITIES IN
HER I HAD TERMED TASTE AND FANCY OUGHT RATHER TO HAVE BEEN DENOMINATED
JUDGMENT AND IMAGINATION
WHEN I INTIMATED SO MUCH WHICH I DID AS USUAL
IN DRY AND STINTED PHRASE I LOOKED FOR THE RADIANT AND EXULTING SMILE
MY ONE WORD OF EULOGY HAD ELICITED BEFORE BUT FRANCES COLOURED
IF SHE
DID SMILE IT WAS VERY SOFTLY AND SHYLY AND INSTEAD OF LOOKING UP TO ME
WITH A CONQUERING GLANCE HER EYES RESTED ON MY HAND WHICH STRETCHED
OVER HER SHOULDER WAS WRITING SOME DIRECTIONS WITH A PENCIL ON THE
MARGIN OF HER BOOK
WELL ARE YOU PLEASED THAT I AM SATISFIED WITH YOUR PROGRESS I ASKED
YES SAID SHE SLOWLY GENTLY THE BLUSH THAT HAD HALF SUBSIDED
RETURNING
BUT I DO NOT SAY ENOUGH I SUPPOSE I CONTINUED
MY PRAISES ARE TOO
COOL
SHE MADE NO ANSWER AND I THOUGHT LOOKED A LITTLE SAD
I DIVINED HER
THOUGHTS AND SHOULD MUCH HAVE LIKED TO HAVE RESPONDED TO THEM HAD
IT BEEN EXPEDIENT SO TO DO
SHE WAS NOT NOW VERY AMBITIOUS OF
MY ADMIRATION NOT EAGERLY DESIROUS OF DAZZLING ME A LITTLE
AFFECTION EVER SO LITTLE PLEASED HER BETTER THAN ALL THE PANEGYRICS IN
THE WORLD
FEELING THIS I STOOD A GOOD WHILE BEHIND HER WRITING ON
THE MARGIN OF HER BOOK
I COULD HARDLY QUIT MY STATION OR RELINQUISH MY
OCCUPATION SOMETHING RETAINED ME BENDING THERE MY HEAD VERY NEAR
HERS AND MY HAND NEAR HERS TOO BUT THE MARGIN OF A COPY BOOK IS NOT AN
ILLIMITABLE SPACE SO DOUBTLESS THE DIRECTRESS THOUGHT AND SHE TOOK
OCCASION TO WALK PAST IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN BY WHAT ART I PROLONGED SO
DISPROPORTIONATELY THE PERIOD NECESSARY FOR FILLING IT
I WAS OBLIGED TO
GO
DISTASTEFUL EFFORT TO LEAVE WHAT WE MOST PREFER
FRANCES DID NOT BECOME PALE OR FEEBLE IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SEDENTARY
EMPLOYMENT PERHAPS THE STIMULUS IT COMMUNICATED TO HER MIND
COUNTERBALANCED THE INACTION IT IMPOSED ON HER BODY
SHE CHANGED
INDEED CHANGED OBVIOUSLY AND RAPIDLY BUT IT WAS FOR THE BETTER
WHEN
I FIRST SAW HER HER COUNTENANCE WAS SUNLESS HER COMPLEXION COLOURLESS
SHE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD NO SOURCE OF ENJOYMENT NO STORE OF BLISS
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD NOW THE CLOUD HAD PASSED FROM HER MIEN LEAVING
SPACE FOR THE DAWN OF HOPE AND INTEREST AND THOSE FEELINGS ROSE LIKE A
CLEAR MORNING ANIMATING WHAT HAD BEEN DEPRESSED TINTING WHAT HAD BEEN
PALE
HER EYES WHOSE COLOUR I HAD NOT AT FIRST KNOWN SO DIM WERE THEY
WITH REPRESSED TEARS SO SHADOWED WITH CEASELESS DEJECTION NOW LIT BY
A RAY OF THE SUNSHINE THAT CHEERED HER HEART REVEALED IRIDS OF BRIGHT
HAZEL IRIDS LARGE AND FULL SCREENED WITH LONG LASHES AND PUPILS
INSTINCT WITH FIRE
THAT LOOK OF WAN EMACIATION WHICH ANXIETY OR LOW
SPIRITS OFTEN COMMUNICATES TO A THOUGHTFUL THIN FACE RATHER LONG THAN
ROUND HAVING VANISHED FROM HERS A CLEARNESS OF SKIN ALMOST BLOOM
AND A PLUMPNESS ALMOST EMBONPOINT SOFTENED THE DECIDED LINES OF
HER FEATURES
HER FIGURE SHARED IN THIS BENEFICIAL CHANGE IT BECAME
ROUNDER AND AS THE HARMONY OF HER FORM WAS COMPLETE AND HER STATURE OF
THE GRACEFUL MIDDLE HEIGHT ONE DID NOT REGRET OR AT LEAST I DID NOT
REGRET THE ABSENCE OF CONFIRMED FULNESS IN CONTOURS STILL SLIGHT
THOUGH COMPACT ELEGANT FLEXIBLE THE EXQUISITE TURNING OF WAIST
WRIST HAND FOOT AND ANKLE SATISFIED COMPLETELY MY NOTIONS OF
SYMMETRY AND ALLOWED A LIGHTNESS AND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WHICH
CORRESPONDED WITH MY IDEAS OF GRACE
THUS IMPROVED THUS WAKENED TO LIFE MDLLE
HENRI BEGAN TO TAKE A
NEW FOOTING IN THE SCHOOL HER MENTAL POWER MANIFESTED GRADUALLY BUT
STEADILY ERE LONG EXTORTED RECOGNITION EVEN FROM THE ENVIOUS AND WHEN
THE YOUNG AND HEALTHY SAW THAT SHE COULD SMILE BRIGHTLY CONVERSE GAILY
MOVE WITH VIVACITY AND ALERTNESS THEY ACKNOWLEDGED IN HER A SISTERHOOD
OF YOUTH AND HEALTH AND TOLERATED HER AS OF THEIR KIND ACCORDINGLY
TO SPEAK TRUTH I WATCHED THIS CHANGE MUCH AS A GARDENER WATCHES THE
GROWTH OF A PRECIOUS PLANT AND I CONTRIBUTED TO IT TOO EVEN AS THE
SAID GARDENER CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS FAVOURITE
TO ME IT
WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER HOW I COULD BEST FOSTER MY PUPIL CHERISH
HER STARVED FEELINGS AND INDUCE THE OUTWARD MANIFESTATION OF THAT
INWARD VIGOUR WHICH SUNLESS DROUGHT AND BLIGHTING BLAST HAD HITHERTO
FORBIDDEN TO EXPAND
CONSTANCY OF ATTENTION A KINDNESS AS MUTE
AS WATCHFUL ALWAYS STANDING BY HER CLOAKED IN THE ROUGH GARB OF
AUSTERITY AND MAKING ITS REAL NATURE KNOWN ONLY BY A RARE GLANCE OF
INTEREST OR A CORDIAL AND GENTLE WORD REAL RESPECT MASKED WITH SEEMING
IMPERIOUSNESS DIRECTING URGING HER ACTIONS YET HELPING HER TOO AND
THAT WITH DEVOTED CARE THESE WERE THE MEANS I USED FOR THESE MEANS
BEST SUITED FRANCES' FEELINGS AS SUSCEPTIBLE AS DEEP VIBRATING HER
NATURE AT ONCE PROUD AND SHY
THE BENEFITS OF MY SYSTEM BECAME APPARENT ALSO IN HER ALTERED DEMEANOUR
AS A TEACHER SHE NOW TOOK HER PLACE AMONGST HER PUPILS WITH AN AIR
OF SPIRIT AND FIRMNESS WHICH ASSURED THEM AT ONCE THAT SHE MEANT TO BE
OBEYED AND OBEYED SHE WAS
THEY FELT THEY HAD LOST THEIR POWER OVER
HER
IF ANY GIRL HAD REBELLED SHE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE TAKEN HER
REBELLION TO HEART SHE POSSESSED A SOURCE OF COMFORT THEY COULD NOT
DRAIN A PILLAR OF SUPPORT THEY COULD NOT OVERTHROW FORMERLY WHEN
INSULTED SHE WEPT NOW SHE SMILED
THE PUBLIC READING OF ONE OF HER DEVOIRS ACHIEVED THE REVELATION OF HER
TALENTS TO ALL AND SUNDRY I REMEMBER THE SUBJECT IT WAS AN EMIGRANT'S
LETTER TO HIS FRIENDS AT HOME
IT OPENED WITH SIMPLICITY SOME NATURAL
AND GRAPHIC TOUCHES DISCLOSED TO THE READER THE SCENE OF VIRGIN FOREST
AND GREAT NEW WORLD RIVER BARREN OF SAIL AND FLAG AMIDST WHICH THE
EPISTLE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE INDITED
THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS THAT
ATTEND A SETTLER'S LIFE WERE HINTED AT AND IN THE FEW WORDS SAID ON
THAT SUBJECT MDLLE
HENRI FAILED NOT TO RENDER AUDIBLE THE VOICE OF
RESOLVE PATIENCE ENDEAVOUR
THE DISASTERS WHICH HAD DRIVEN HIM
FROM HIS NATIVE COUNTRY WERE ALLUDED TO STAINLESS HONOUR INFLEXIBLE
INDEPENDENCE INDESTRUCTIBLE SELF RESPECT THERE TOOK THE WORD
PAST
DAYS WERE SPOKEN OF THE GRIEF OF PARTING THE REGRETS OF ABSENCE WERE
TOUCHED UPON FEELING FORCIBLE AND FINE BREATHED ELOQUENT IN EVERY
PERIOD
AT THE CLOSE CONSOLATION WAS SUGGESTED RELIGIOUS FAITH BECAME
THERE THE SPEAKER AND SHE SPOKE WELL
THE DEVOIR WAS POWERFULLY WRITTEN IN LANGUAGE AT ONCE CHASTE AND CHOICE
IN A STYLE NERVED WITH VIGOUR AND GRACED WITH HARMONY
MDLLE
REUTER WAS QUITE SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH ENGLISH TO
UNDERSTAND IT WHEN READ OR SPOKEN IN HER PRESENCE THOUGH SHE COULD
NEITHER SPEAK NOR WRITE IT HERSELF
DURING THE PERUSAL OF THIS DEVOIR
SHE SAT PLACIDLY BUSY HER EYES AND FINGERS OCCUPIED WITH THE FORMATION
OF A RIVIERE OR OPEN WORK HEM ROUND A CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF SHE
SAID NOTHING AND HER FACE AND FOREHEAD CLOTHED WITH A MASK OF PURELY
NEGATIVE EXPRESSION WERE AS BLANK OF COMMENT AS HER LIPS
AS NEITHER
SURPRISE PLEASURE APPROBATION NOR INTEREST WERE EVINCED IN HER
COUNTENANCE SO NO MORE WERE DISDAIN ENVY ANNOYANCE WEARINESS IF
THAT INSCRUTABLE MIEN SAID ANYTHING IT WAS SIMPLY THIS
THE MATTER IS TOO TRITE TO EXCITE AN EMOTION OR CALL FORTH AN
OPINION
AS SOON AS I HAD DONE A HUM ROSE SEVERAL OF THE PUPILS PRESSING ROUND
MDLLE
HENRI BEGAN TO BESET HER WITH COMPLIMENTS THE COMPOSED VOICE OF
THE DIRECTRESS WAS NOW HEARD
YOUNG LADIES SUCH OF YOU AS HAVE CLOAKS AND UMBRELLAS WILL HASTEN
TO RETURN HOME BEFORE THE SHOWER BECOMES HEAVIER IT WAS RAINING A
LITTLE THE REMAINDER WILL WAIT TILL THEIR RESPECTIVE SERVANTS ARRIVE
TO FETCH THEM AND THE SCHOOL DISPERSED FOR IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK
MONSIEUR A WORD SAID MDLLE
REUTER STEPPING ON TO THE ESTRADE AND
SIGNIFYING BY A MOVEMENT OF THE HAND THAT SHE WISHED ME TO RELINQUISH
FOR AN INSTANT THE CASTOR I HAD CLUTCHED
MADEMOISELLE I AM AT YOUR SERVICE
MONSIEUR IT IS OF COURSE AN EXCELLENT PLAN TO ENCOURAGE EFFORT IN
YOUNG PEOPLE BY MAKING CONSPICUOUS THE PROGRESS OF ANY PARTICULARLY
INDUSTRIOUS PUPIL BUT DO YOU NOT THINK THAT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE
MDLLE
HENRI CAN HARDLY BE CONSIDERED AS A CONCURRENT WITH THE OTHER
PUPILS SHE IS OLDER THAN MOST OF THEM AND HAS HAD ADVANTAGES OF AN
EXCLUSIVE NATURE FOR ACQUIRING A KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH ON THE OTHER
HAND HER SPHERE OF LIFE IS SOMEWHAT BENEATH THEIRS UNDER THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES A PUBLIC DISTINCTION CONFERRED UPON MDLLE
HENRI MAY BE
THE MEANS OF SUGGESTING COMPARISONS AND EXCITING FEELINGS SUCH AS WOULD
BE FAR FROM ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE INDIVIDUAL FORMING THEIR OBJECT
THE
INTEREST I TAKE IN MDLLE
HENRI'S REAL WELFARE MAKES ME DESIROUS OF
SCREENING HER FROM ANNOYANCES OF THIS SORT BESIDES MONSIEUR AS I
HAVE BEFORE HINTED TO YOU THE SENTIMENT OF AMOUR PROPRE HAS A SOMEWHAT
MARKED PREPONDERANCE IN HER CHARACTER CELEBRITY HAS A TENDENCY TO
FOSTER THIS SENTIMENT AND IN HER IT SHOULD BE RATHER REPRESSED SHE
RATHER NEEDS KEEPING DOWN THAN BRINGING FORWARD AND THEN I THINK
MONSIEUR IT APPEARS TO ME THAT AMBITION LITERARY AMBITION ESPECIALLY
IS NOT A FEELING TO BE CHERISHED IN THE MIND OF A WOMAN WOULD NOT
MDLLE
HENRI BE MUCH SAFER AND HAPPIER IF TAUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT IN THE
QUIET DISCHARGE OF SOCIAL DUTIES CONSISTS HER REAL VOCATION THAN IF
STIMULATED TO ASPIRE AFTER APPLAUSE AND PUBLICITY SHE MAY NEVER MARRY
SCANTY AS ARE HER RESOURCES OBSCURE AS ARE HER CONNECTIONS UNCERTAIN
AS IS HER HEALTH FOR I THINK HER CONSUMPTIVE HER MOTHER DIED OF THAT
COMPLAINT IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE SHE NEVER WILL
I DO NOT SEE HOW
SHE CAN RISE TO A POSITION WHENCE SUCH A STEP WOULD BE POSSIBLE BUT
EVEN IN CELIBACY IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER TO RETAIN THE CHARACTER AND
HABITS OF A RESPECTABLE DECOROUS FEMALE
INDISPUTABLY MADEMOISELLE WAS MY ANSWER
YOUR OPINION ADMITS OF NO
DOUBT AND FEARFUL OF THE HARANGUE BEING RENEWED I RETREATED UNDER
COVER OF THAT CORDIAL SENTENCE OF ASSENT
AT THE DATE OF A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE LITTLE INCIDENT NOTED ABOVE I FIND
IT RECORDED IN MY DIARY THAT A HIATUS OCCURRED IN MDLLE
HENRI'S USUALLY
REGULAR ATTENDANCE IN CLASS
THE FIRST DAY OR TWO I WONDERED AT HER
ABSENCE BUT DID NOT LIKE TO ASK AN EXPLANATION OF IT I THOUGHT INDEED
SOME CHANCE WORD MIGHT BE DROPPED WHICH WOULD AFFORD ME THE INFORMATION
I WISHED TO OBTAIN WITHOUT MY RUNNING THE RISK OF EXCITING SILLY SMILES
AND GOSSIPING WHISPERS BY DEMANDING IT
BUT WHEN A WEEK PASSED AND
THE SEAT AT THE DESK NEAR THE DOOR STILL REMAINED VACANT AND WHEN
NO ALLUSION WAS MADE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE BY ANY INDIVIDUAL OF THE
CLASS WHEN ON THE CONTRARY I FOUND THAT ALL OBSERVED A MARKED SILENCE
ON THE POINT I DETERMINED COUTE QUI COUTE TO BREAK THE ICE OF THIS
SILLY RESERVE
I SELECTED SYLVIE AS MY INFORMANT BECAUSE FROM HER I
KNEW THAT I SHOULD AT LEAST GET A SENSIBLE ANSWER UNACCOMPANIED BY
WRIGGLE TITTER OR OTHER FLOURISH OF FOLLY
OU DONC EST MDLLE
HENRI I SAID ONE DAY AS I RETURNED AN
EXERCISE BOOK I HAD BEEN EXAMINING
ELLE EST PARTIE MONSIEUR
PARTIE ET POUR COMBIEN DE TEMPS QUAND REVIENDRA T ELLE
ELLE EST PARTIE POUR TOUJOURS MONSIEUR ELLE NE REVIENDRA PLUS
AH WAS MY INVOLUNTARY EXCLAMATION THEN AFTER A PAUSE
EN ETES VOUS BIEN SURE SYLVIE
OUI OUI MONSIEUR MADEMOISELLE LA DIRECTRICE NOUS L'A DIT ELLE MEME
IL Y A DEUX OU TROIS JOURS
AND I COULD PURSUE MY INQUIRIES NO FURTHER TIME PLACE AND
CIRCUMSTANCES FORBADE MY ADDING ANOTHER WORD
I COULD NEITHER COMMENT ON
WHAT HAD BEEN SAID NOR DEMAND FURTHER PARTICULARS
A QUESTION AS TO THE
REASON OF THE TEACHER'S DEPARTURE AS TO WHETHER IT HAD BEEN VOLUNTARY
OR OTHERWISE WAS INDEED ON MY LIPS BUT I SUPPRESSED IT THERE WERE
LISTENERS ALL ROUND
AN HOUR AFTER IN PASSING SYLVIE IN THE CORRIDOR AS
SHE WAS PUTTING ON HER BONNET I STOPPED SHORT AND ASKED
SYLVIE DO YOU KNOW MDLLE
HENRI'S ADDRESS I HAVE SOME BOOKS OF HERS
I ADDED CARELESSLY AND I SHOULD WISH TO SEND THEM TO HER
NO MONSIEUR REPLIED SYLVIE BUT PERHAPS ROSALIE THE PORTRESS WILL
BE ABLE TO GIVE IT YOU
ROSALIE'S CABINET WAS JUST AT HAND I STEPPED IN AND REPEATED THE
INQUIRY
ROSALIE A SMART FRENCH GRISETTE LOOKED UP FROM HER WORK WITH
A KNOWING SMILE PRECISELY THE SORT OF SMILE I HAD BEEN SO DESIROUS TO
AVOID EXCITING
HER ANSWER WAS PREPARED SHE KNEW NOTHING WHATEVER
OF MDLLE
HENRI'S ADDRESS HAD NEVER KNOWN IT
TURNING FROM HER WITH
IMPATIENCE FOR I BELIEVED SHE LIED AND WAS HIRED TO LIE I ALMOST
KNOCKED DOWN SOME ONE WHO HAD BEEN STANDING AT MY BACK IT WAS THE
DIRECTRESS
MY ABRUPT MOVEMENT MADE HER RECOIL TWO OR THREE STEPS
I WAS
OBLIGED TO APOLOGIZE WHICH I DID MORE CONCISELY THAN POLITELY
NO MAN
LIKES TO BE DOGGED AND IN THE VERY IRRITABLE MOOD IN WHICH I THEN
WAS THE SIGHT OF MDLLE
REUTER THOROUGHLY INCENSED ME
AT THE MOMENT I
TURNED HER COUNTENANCE LOOKED HARD DARK AND INQUISITIVE HER EYES
WERE BENT UPON ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF ALMOST HUNGRY CURIOSITY
I HAD
SCARCELY CAUGHT THIS PHASE OF PHYSIOGNOMY ERE IT HAD VANISHED A
BLAND SMILE PLAYED ON HER FEATURES MY HARSH APOLOGY WAS RECEIVED WITH
GOOD HUMOURED FACILITY
OH DON'T MENTION IT MONSIEUR YOU ONLY TOUCHED MY HAIR WITH YOUR
ELBOW IT IS NO WORSE ONLY A LITTLE DISHEVELLED SHE SHOOK IT BACK
AND PASSING HER FINGERS THROUGH HER CURLS LOOSENED THEM INTO MORE
NUMEROUS AND FLOWING RINGLETS
THEN SHE WENT ON WITH VIVACITY
ROSALIE I WAS COMING TO TELL YOU TO GO INSTANTLY AND CLOSE THE WINDOWS
OF THE SALON THE WIND IS RISING AND THE MUSLIN CURTAINS WILL BE
COVERED WITH DUST
ROSALIE DEPARTED
NOW THOUGHT I THIS WILL NOT DO MDLLE
REUTER
THINKS HER MEANNESS IN EAVES DROPPING IS SCREENED BY HER ART IN DEVISING
A PRETEXT WHEREAS THE MUSLIN CURTAINS SHE SPEAKS OF ARE NOT MORE
TRANSPARENT THAN THIS SAME PRETEXT AN IMPULSE CAME OVER ME TO THRUST
THE FLIMSY SCREEN ASIDE AND CONFRONT HER CRAFT BOLDLY WITH A WORD OR
TWO OF PLAIN TRUTH
THE ROUGH SHOD FOOT TREADS MOST FIRMLY ON SLIPPERY
GROUND THOUGHT I SO I BEGAN
MADEMOISELLE HENRI HAS LEFT YOUR ESTABLISHMENT BEEN DISMISSED I
PRESUME
AH I WISHED TO HAVE A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH YOU MONSIEUR REPLIED
THE DIRECTRESS WITH THE MOST NATURAL AND AFFABLE AIR IN THE WORLD
BUT WE CANNOT TALK QUIETLY HERE WILL MONSIEUR STEP INTO THE GARDEN A
MINUTE AND SHE PRECEDED ME STEPPING OUT THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR I HAVE
BEFORE MENTIONED
THERE SAID SHE WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE MIDDLE ALLEY
AND WHEN THE FOLIAGE OF SHRUBS AND TREES NOW IN THEIR SUMMER PRIDE
CLOSING BEHIND END AROUND US SHUT OUT THE VIEW OF THE HOUSE AND THUS
IMPARTED A SENSE OF SECLUSION EVEN TO THIS LITTLE PLOT OF GROUND IN THE
VERY CORE OF A CAPITAL
THERE ONE FEELS QUIET AND FREE WHEN THERE ARE ONLY PEAR TREES AND
ROSE BUSHES ABOUT ONE I DARE SAY YOU LIKE ME MONSIEUR ARE SOMETIMES
TIRED OF BEING ETERNALLY IN THE MIDST OF LIFE OF HAVING HUMAN FACES
ALWAYS ROUND YOU HUMAN EYES ALWAYS UPON YOU HUMAN VOICES ALWAYS IN
YOUR EAR
I AM SURE I OFTEN WISH INTENSELY FOR LIBERTY TO SPEND A WHOLE
MONTH IN THE COUNTRY AT SOME LITTLE FARM HOUSE BIEN GENTILLE BIEN
PROPRE TOUT ENTOUREE DE CHAMPS ET DE BOIS QUELLE VIE CHARMANTE QUE LA
VIE CHAMPETRE N'EST CE PAS MONSIEUR
CELA DEPEND MADEMOISELLE
QUE LE VENT EST BON ET FRAIS CONTINUED THE DIRECTRESS AND SHE WAS
RIGHT THERE FOR IT WAS A SOUTH WIND SOFT AND SWEET
I CARRIED MY HAT
IN MY HAND AND THIS GENTLE BREEZE PASSING THROUGH MY HAIR SOOTHED MY
TEMPLES LIKE BALM
ITS REFRESHING EFFECT HOWEVER PENETRATED NO DEEPER
THAN THE MERE SURFACE OF THE FRAME FOR AS I WALKED BY THE SIDE OF
MDLLE
REUTER MY HEART WAS STILL HOT WITHIN ME AND WHILE I WAS MUSING
THE FIRE BURNED THEN SPAKE I WITH MY TONGUE
I UNDERSTAND MDLLE
HENRI IS GONE FROM HENCE AND WILL NOT RETURN
AH TRUE I MEANT TO HAVE NAMED THE SUBJECT TO YOU SOME DAYS AGO BUT
MY TIME IS SO COMPLETELY TAKEN UP I CANNOT DO HALF THE THINGS I WISH
HAVE YOU NEVER EXPERIENCED WHAT IT IS MONSIEUR TO FIND THE DAY TOO
SHORT BY TWELVE HOURS FOR YOUR NUMEROUS DUTIES
NOT OFTEN
MDLLE
HENRI'S DEPARTURE WAS NOT VOLUNTARY I PRESUME IF IT
HAD BEEN SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE GIVEN ME SOME INTIMATION OF IT BEING
MY PUPIL
OH DID SHE NOT TELL YOU THAT WAS STRANGE FOR MY PART I NEVER
THOUGHT OF ADVERTING TO THE SUBJECT WHEN ONE HAS SO MANY THINGS TO
ATTEND TO ONE IS APT TO FORGET LITTLE INCIDENTS THAT ARE NOT OF PRIMARY
IMPORTANCE
YOU CONSIDER MDLLE
HENRI'S DISMISSION THEN AS A VERY INSIGNIFICANT
EVENT
DISMISSION AH SHE WAS NOT DISMISSED I CAN SAY WITH TRUTH MONSIEUR
THAT SINCE I BECAME THE HEAD OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT NO MASTER OR TEACHER
HAS EVER BEEN DISMISSED FROM IT
YET SOME HAVE LEFT IT MADEMOISELLE
MANY I HAVE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO CHANGE FREQUENTLY A CHANGE OF
INSTRUCTORS IS OFTEN BENEFICIAL TO THE INTERESTS OF A SCHOOL IT GIVES
LIFE AND VARIETY TO THE PROCEEDINGS IT AMUSES THE PUPILS AND SUGGESTS
TO THE PARENTS THE IDEA OF EXERTION AND PROGRESS
YET WHEN YOU ARE TIRED OF A PROFESSOR OR MAITRESSE YOU SCRUPLE TO
DISMISS THEM
NO NEED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SUCH EXTREME MEASURES I ASSURE YOU
ALLONS MONSIEUR LE PROFESSEUR ASSEYONS NOUS JE VAIS VOUS DONNER UNE
PETITE LECON DANS VOTRE ETAT D'INSTITUTEUR I WISH I MIGHT WRITE
ALL SHE SAID TO ME IN FRENCH IT LOSES SADLY BY BEING TRANSLATED INTO
ENGLISH WE HAD NOW REACHED THE GARDEN CHAIR THE DIRECTRESS SAT DOWN
AND SIGNED TO ME TO SIT BY HER BUT I ONLY RESTED MY KNEE ON THE SEAT
AND STOOD LEANING MY HEAD AND ARM AGAINST THE EMBOWERING BRANCH OF A
HUGE LABURNUM WHOSE GOLDEN FLOWERS BLENT WITH THE DUSKY GREEN LEAVES
OF A LILAC BUSH FORMED A MIXED ARCH OF SHADE AND SUNSHINE OVER THE
RETREAT
MDLLE
REUTER SAT SILENT A MOMENT SOME NOVEL MOVEMENTS WERE
EVIDENTLY WORKING IN HER MIND AND THEY SHOWED THEIR NATURE ON HER
ASTUTE BROW SHE WAS MEDITATING SOME CHEF D'OEUVRE OF POLICY
CONVINCED
BY SEVERAL MONTHS' EXPERIENCE THAT THE AFFECTATION OF VIRTUES SHE DID
NOT POSSESS WAS UNAVAILING TO ENSNARE ME AWARE THAT I HAD READ HER REAL
NATURE AND WOULD BELIEVE NOTHING OF THE CHARACTER SHE GAVE OUT AS BEING
HERS SHE HAD DETERMINED AT LAST TO TRY A NEW KEY AND SEE IF THE LOCK
OF MY HEART WOULD YIELD TO THAT A LITTLE AUDACITY A WORD OF TRUTH A
GLIMPSE OF THE REAL
YES I WILL TRY WAS HER INWARD RESOLVE AND THEN
HER BLUE EYE GLITTERED UPON ME IT DID NOT FLASH NOTHING OF FLAME EVER
KINDLED IN ITS TEMPERATE GLEAM
MONSIEUR FEARS TO SIT BY ME SHE INQUIRED PLAYFULLY
I HAVE NO WISH TO USURP PELET'S PLACE I ANSWERED FOR I HAD GOT THE
HABIT OF SPEAKING TO HER BLUNTLY A HABIT BEGUN IN ANGER BUT CONTINUED
BECAUSE I SAW THAT INSTEAD OF OFFENDING IT FASCINATED HER
SHE CAST
DOWN HER EYES AND DROOPED HER EYELIDS SHE SIGHED UNEASILY SHE TURNED
WITH AN ANXIOUS GESTURE AS IF SHE WOULD GIVE ME THE IDEA OF A BIRD THAT
FLUTTERS IN ITS CAGE AND WOULD FAIN FLY FROM ITS JAIL AND JAILER AND
SEEK ITS NATURAL MATE AND PLEASANT NEST
WELL AND YOUR LESSON I DEMANDED BRIEFLY
AH SHE EXCLAIMED RECOVERING HERSELF YOU ARE SO YOUNG SO FRANK
AND FEARLESS SO TALENTED SO IMPATIENT OF IMBECILITY SO DISDAINFUL OF
VULGARITY YOU NEED A LESSON HERE IT IS THEN FAR MORE IS TO BE DONE
IN THIS WORLD BY DEXTERITY THAN BY STRENGTH BUT PERHAPS YOU KNEW
THAT BEFORE FOR THERE IS DELICACY AS WELL AS POWER IN YOUR
CHARACTER POLICY AS WELL AS PRIDE
GO ON SAID I AND I COULD HARDLY HELP SMILING THE FLATTERY WAS SO
PIQUANT SO FINELY SEASONED
SHE CAUGHT THE PROHIBITED SMILE THOUGH I
PASSED MY HAND OVER MY MONTH TO CONCEAL IT AND AGAIN SHE MADE ROOM FOR
ME TO SIT BESIDE HER
I SHOOK MY HEAD THOUGH TEMPTATION PENETRATED TO
MY SENSES AT THE MOMENT AND ONCE MORE I TOLD HER TO GO ON
WELL THEN IF EVER YOU ARE AT THE HEAD OF A LARGE ESTABLISHMENT
DISMISS NOBODY
TO SPEAK TRUTH MONSIEUR AND TO YOU I WILL SPEAK
TRUTH I DESPISE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS MAKING ROWS BLUSTERING SENDING
OFF ONE TO THE RIGHT AND ANOTHER TO THE LEFT URGING AND HURRYING
CIRCUMSTANCES
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I LIKE BEST TO DO MONSIEUR SHALL I
SHE LOOKED UP AGAIN SHE HAD COMPOUNDED HER GLANCE WELL THIS TIME MUCH
ARCHNESS MORE DEFERENCE A SPICY DASH OF COQUETRY AN UNVEILED
CONSCIOUSNESS OF CAPACITY
I NODDED SHE TREATED ME LIKE THE GREAT
MOGUL SO I BECAME THE GREAT MOGUL AS FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED
I LIKE MONSIEUR TO TAKE MY KNITTING IN MY HANDS AND TO SIT QUIETLY
DOWN IN MY CHAIR CIRCUMSTANCES DEFILE PAST ME I WATCH THEIR MARCH SO
LONG AS THEY FOLLOW THE COURSE I WISH I SAY NOTHING AND DO NOTHING I
DON'T CLAP MY HANDS AND CRY OUT 'BRAVO HOW LUCKY I AM TO ATTRACT
THE ATTENTION AND ENVY OF MY NEIGHBOURS I AM MERELY PASSIVE BUT WHEN
EVENTS FALL OUT ILL WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES BECOME ADVERSE I WATCH VERY
VIGILANTLY I KNIT ON STILL AND STILL I HOLD MY TONGUE BUT EVERY NOW
AND THEN MONSIEUR I JUST PUT MY TOE OUT SO AND GIVE THE REBELLIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCE A LITTLE SECRET PUSH WITHOUT NOISE WHICH SENDS IT THE WAY
I WISH AND I AM SUCCESSFUL AFTER ALL AND NOBODY HAS SEEN MY EXPEDIENT
SO WHEN TEACHERS OR MASTERS BECOME TROUBLESOME AND INEFFICIENT WHEN
IN SHORT THE INTERESTS OF THE SCHOOL WOULD SUFFER FROM THEIR RETAINING
THEIR PLACES I MIND MY KNITTING EVENTS PROGRESS CIRCUMSTANCES GLIDE
PAST I SEE ONE WHICH IF PUSHED EVER SO LITTLE AWRY WILL RENDER
UNTENABLE THE POST I WISH TO HAVE VACATED THE DEED IS DONE THE
STUMBLING BLOCK REMOVED AND NO ONE SAW ME I HAVE NOT MADE AN ENEMY I
AM RID OF AN INCUMBRANCE
A MOMENT SINCE AND I THOUGHT HER ALLURING THIS SPEECH CONCLUDED I
LOOKED ON HER WITH DISTASTE
JUST LIKE YOU WAS MY COLD ANSWER
AND IN THIS WAY YOU HAVE OUSTED MDLLE
HENRI YOU WANTED HER OFFICE
THEREFORE YOU RENDERED IT INTOLERABLE TO HER
NOT AT ALL MONSIEUR I WAS MERELY ANXIOUS ABOUT MDLLE
HENRI'S HEALTH
NO YOUR MORAL SIGHT IS CLEAR AND PIERCING BUT THERE YOU HAVE FAILED
TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH
I TOOK I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN A REAL INTEREST IN
MDLLE
HENRI'S WELFARE I DID NOT LIKE HER GOING OUT IN ALL WEATHERS
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR HER TO OBTAIN A PERMANENT
SITUATION BESIDES I CONSIDERED HER NOW QUALIFIED TO DO SOMETHING MORE
THAN TEACH SEWING
I REASONED WITH HER LEFT THE DECISION TO HERSELF
SHE SAW THE CORRECTNESS OF MY VIEWS AND ADOPTED THEM
EXCELLENT AND NOW MADEMOISELLE YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO GIVE ME
HER ADDRESS
HER ADDRESS AND A SOMBRE AND STONY CHANGE CAME OVER THE MIEN OF
THE DIRECTRESS
HER ADDRESS AH WELL I WISH I COULD OBLIGE YOU
MONSIEUR BUT I CANNOT AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY WHENEVER I MYSELF ASKED
HER FOR HER ADDRESS SHE ALWAYS EVADED THE INQUIRY
I THOUGHT I MAY
BE WRONG BUT I THOUGHT HER MOTIVE FOR DOING SO WAS A NATURAL THOUGH
MISTAKEN RELUCTANCE TO INTRODUCE ME TO SOME PROBABLY VERY POOR
ABODE HER MEANS WERE NARROW HER ORIGIN OBSCURE SHE LIVES SOMEWHERE
DOUBTLESS IN THE 'BASSE VILLE
I'LL NOT LOSE SIGHT OF MY BEST PUPIL YET SAID I THOUGH SHE WERE
BORN OF BEGGARS AND LODGED IN A CELLAR FOR THE REST IT IS ABSURD TO
MAKE A BUGBEAR OF HER ORIGIN TO ME I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS A
SWISS PASTOR'S DAUGHTER NEITHER MORE NOR LESS AND AS TO HER NARROW
MEANS I CARE NOTHING FOR THE POVERTY OF HER PURSE SO LONG AS HER HEART
OVERFLOWS WITH AFFLUENCE
YOUR SENTIMENTS ARE PERFECTLY NOBLE MONSIEUR SAID THE DIRECTRESS
AFFECTING TO SUPPRESS A YAWN HER SPRIGHTLINESS WAS NOW EXTINCT HER
TEMPORARY CANDOUR SHUT UP THE LITTLE RED COLOURED PIRATICAL LOOKING
PENNON OF AUDACITY SHE HAD ALLOWED TO FLOAT A MINUTE IN THE AIR WAS
FURLED AND THE BROAD SOBER HUED FLAG OF DISSIMULATION AGAIN HUNG
LOW OVER THE CITADEL
I DID NOT LIKE HER THUS SO I CUT SHORT THE
TETE A TETE AND DEPARTED
CHAPTER XIX
NOVELISTS SHOULD NEVER ALLOW THEMSELVES TO WEARY OF THE STUDY OF REAL
LIFE
IF THEY OBSERVED THIS DUTY CONSCIENTIOUSLY THEY WOULD GIVE US
FEWER PICTURES CHEQUERED WITH VIVID CONTRASTS OF LIGHT AND SHADE
THEY WOULD SELDOM ELEVATE THEIR HEROES AND HEROINES TO THE HEIGHTS OF
RAPTURE STILL SELDOMER SINK THEM TO THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR FOR IF WE
RARELY TASTE THE FULNESS OF JOY IN THIS LIFE WE YET MORE RARELY SAVOUR
THE ACRID BITTERNESS OF HOPELESS ANGUISH UNLESS INDEED WE HAVE
PLUNGED LIKE BEASTS INTO SENSUAL INDULGENCE ABUSED STRAINED
STIMULATED AGAIN OVERSTRAINED AND AT LAST DESTROYED OUR FACULTIES
FOR ENJOYMENT THEN TRULY WE MAY FIND OURSELVES WITHOUT SUPPORT
ROBBED OF HOPE
OUR AGONY IS GREAT AND HOW CAN IT END WE HAVE BROKEN
THE SPRING OF OUR POWERS LIFE MUST BE ALL SUFFERING TOO FEEBLE TO
CONCEIVE FAITH DEATH MUST BE DARKNESS GOD SPIRITS RELIGION CAN HAVE
NO PLACE IN OUR COLLAPSED MINDS WHERE LINGER ONLY HIDEOUS AND POLLUTING
RECOLLECTIONS OF VICE AND TIME BRINGS US ON TO THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE
AND DISSOLUTION FLINGS US IN A RAG EATEN THROUGH AND THROUGH WITH
DISEASE WRUNG TOGETHER WITH PAIN STAMPED INTO THE CHURCHYARD SOD BY
THE INEXORABLE HEEL OF DESPAIR
BUT THE MAN OF REGULAR LIFE AND RATIONAL MIND NEVER DESPAIRS
HE LOSES
HIS PROPERTY IT IS A BLOW HE STAGGERS A MOMENT THEN HIS ENERGIES
ROUSED BY THE SMART ARE AT WORK TO SEEK A REMEDY ACTIVITY SOON
MITIGATES REGRET
SICKNESS AFFECTS HIM HE TAKES PATIENCE ENDURES WHAT
HE CANNOT CURE
ACUTE PAIN RACKS HIM HIS WRITHING LIMBS KNOW NOT WHERE
TO FIND REST HE LEANS ON HOPE'S ANCHORS
DEATH TAKES FROM HIM WHAT
HE LOVES ROOTS UP AND TEARS VIOLENTLY AWAY THE STEM ROUND WHICH HIS
AFFECTIONS WERE TWINED A DARK DISMAL TIME A FRIGHTFUL WRENCH BUT
SOME MORNING RELIGION LOOKS INTO HIS DESOLATE HOUSE WITH SUNRISE AND
SAYS THAT IN ANOTHER WORLD ANOTHER LIFE HE SHALL MEET HIS KINDRED
AGAIN
SHE SPEAKS OF THAT WORLD AS A PLACE UNSULLIED BY SIN OF THAT
LIFE AS AN ERA UNEMBITTERED BY SUFFERING SHE MIGHTILY STRENGTHENS
HER CONSOLATION BY CONNECTING WITH IT TWO IDEAS WHICH MORTALS CANNOT
COMPREHEND BUT ON WHICH THEY LOVE TO REPOSE ETERNITY IMMORTALITY AND
THE MIND OF THE MOURNER BEING FILLED WITH AN IMAGE FAINT YET GLORIOUS
OF HEAVENLY HILLS ALL LIGHT AND PEACE OF A SPIRIT RESTING THERE IN
BLISS OF A DAY WHEN HIS SPIRIT SHALL ALSO ALIGHT THERE FREE AND
DISEMBODIED OF A REUNION PERFECTED BY LOVE PURIFIED FROM FEAR HE
TAKES COURAGE GOES OUT TO ENCOUNTER THE NECESSITIES AND DISCHARGE THE
DUTIES OF LIFE AND THOUGH SADNESS MAY NEVER LIFT HER BURDEN FROM HIS
MIND HOPE WILL ENABLE HIM TO SUPPORT IT
WELL AND WHAT SUGGESTED ALL THIS AND WHAT IS THE INFERENCE TO BE DRAWN
THEREFROM WHAT SUGGESTED IT IS THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY BEST PUPIL MY
TREASURE BEING SNATCHED FROM MY HANDS AND PUT AWAY OUT OF MY REACH
THE INFERENCE TO BE DRAWN FROM IT IS THAT BEING A STEADY REASONABLE
MAN I DID NOT ALLOW THE RESENTMENT DISAPPOINTMENT AND GRIEF
ENGENDERED IN MY MIND BY THIS EVIL CHANCE TO GROW THERE TO ANY
MONSTROUS SIZE NOR DID I ALLOW THEM TO MONOPOLIZE THE WHOLE SPACE OF MY
HEART I PENT THEM ON THE CONTRARY IN ONE STRAIT AND SECRET NOOK
IN
THE DAYTIME TOO WHEN I WAS ABOUT MY DUTIES I PUT THEM ON THE SILENT
SYSTEM AND IT WAS ONLY AFTER I HAD CLOSED THE DOOR OF MY CHAMBER
AT NIGHT THAT I SOMEWHAT RELAXED MY SEVERITY TOWARDS THESE MOROSE
NURSLINGS AND ALLOWED VENT TO THEIR LANGUAGE OF MURMURS THEN IN
REVENGE THEY SAT ON MY PILLOW HAUNTED MY BED AND KEPT ME AWAKE WITH
THEIR LONG MIDNIGHT CRY
A WEEK PASSED
I HAD SAID NOTHING MORE TO MDLLE
REUTER
I HAD BEEN CALM
IN MY DEMEANOUR TO HER THOUGH STONY COLD AND HARD
WHEN I LOOKED AT
HER IT WAS WITH THE GLANCE FITTING TO BE BESTOWED ON ONE WHO I KNEW
HAD CONSULTED JEALOUSY AS AN ADVISER AND EMPLOYED TREACHERY AS AN
INSTRUMENT THE GLANCE OF QUIET DISDAIN AND ROOTED DISTRUST
ON SATURDAY
EVENING ERE I LEFT THE HOUSE I STEPT INTO THE SALLE A MANGER WHERE
SHE WAS SITTING ALONE AND PLACING MYSELF BEFORE HER I ASKED WITH
THE SAME TRANQUIL TONE AND MANNER THAT I SHOULD HAVE USED HAD I PUT THE
QUESTION FOR THE FIRST TIME
MADEMOISELLE WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO GIVE ME THE ADDRESS OF
FRANCES EVANS HENRI
A LITTLE SURPRISED BUT NOT DISCONCERTED SHE SMILINGLY DISCLAIMED ANY
KNOWLEDGE OF THAT ADDRESS ADDING MONSIEUR HAS PERHAPS FORGOTTEN THAT
I EXPLAINED ALL ABOUT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE BEFORE A WEEK AGO
MADEMOISELLE I CONTINUED YOU WOULD GREATLY OBLIGE ME BY DIRECTING
ME TO THAT YOUNG PERSON'S ABODE
SHE SEEMED SOMEWHAT PUZZLED AND AT LAST LOOKING UP WITH AN ADMIRABLY
COUNTERFEITED AIR OF NAIVETE SHE DEMANDED DOES MONSIEUR THINK I AM
TELLING AN UNTRUTH
STILL AVOIDING TO GIVE HER A DIRECT ANSWER I SAID IT IS NOT THEN YOUR
INTENTION MADEMOISELLE TO OBLIGE ME IN THIS PARTICULAR
BUT MONSIEUR HOW CAN I TELL YOU WHAT I DO NOT KNOW
VERY WELL I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY MADEMOISELLE AND NOW I HAVE
ONLY TWO OR THREE WORDS TO SAY
THIS IS THE LAST WEEK IN JULY IN
ANOTHER MONTH THE VACATION WILL COMMENCE HAVE THE GOODNESS TO AVAIL
YOURSELF OF THE LEISURE IT WILL AFFORD YOU TO LOOK OUT FOR ANOTHER
ENGLISH MASTER AT THE CLOSE OF AUGUST I SHALL BE UNDER THE NECESSITY
OF RESIGNING MY POST IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENT
I DID NOT WAIT FOR HER COMMENTS ON THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BUT BOWED AND
IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW
THAT SAME EVENING SOON AFTER DINNER A SERVANT BROUGHT ME A SMALL
PACKET IT WAS DIRECTED IN A HAND I KNEW BUT HAD NOT HOPED SO SOON TO
SEE AGAIN BEING IN MY OWN APARTMENT AND ALONE THERE WAS NOTHING TO
PREVENT MY IMMEDIATELY OPENING IT IT CONTAINED FOUR FIVE FRANC PIECES
AND A NOTE IN ENGLISH
MONSIEUR
I CAME TO MDLLE
REUTER'S HOUSE YESTERDAY AT THE TIME WHEN I KNEW YOU
WOULD BE JUST ABOUT FINISHING YOUR LESSON AND I ASKED IF I MIGHT GO
INTO THE SCHOOLROOM AND SPEAK TO YOU
MDLLE
REUTER CAME OUT AND SAID
YOU WERE ALREADY GONE IT HAD NOT YET STRUCK FOUR SO I THOUGHT SHE MUST
BE MISTAKEN BUT CONCLUDED IT WOULD BE VAIN TO CALL ANOTHER DAY ON THE
SAME ERRAND
IN ONE SENSE A NOTE WILL DO AS WELL IT WILL WRAP UP THE
20 FRANCS THE PRICE OF THE LESSONS I HAVE RECEIVED FROM YOU AND IF IT
WILL NOT FULLY EXPRESS THE THANKS I OWE YOU IN ADDITION IF IT WILL NOT
BID YOU GOOD BYE AS I COULD WISH TO HAVE DONE IF IT WILL NOT TELL YOU
AS I LONG TO DO HOW SORRY I AM THAT I SHALL PROBABLY NEVER SEE YOU
MORE WHY SPOKEN WORDS WOULD HARDLY BE MORE ADEQUATE TO THE TASK
HAD
I SEEN YOU I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE STAMMERED OUT SOMETHING FEEBLE AND
UNSATISFACTORY SOMETHING BELYING MY FEELINGS RATHER THAN EXPLAINING
THEM SO IT IS PERHAPS AS WELL THAT I WAS DENIED ADMISSION TO YOUR
PRESENCE
YOU OFTEN REMARKED MONSIEUR THAT MY DEVOIRS DWELT A GREAT
DEAL ON FORTITUDE IN BEARING GRIEF YOU SAID I INTRODUCED THAT THEME TOO
OFTEN I FIND INDEED THAT IT IS MUCH EASIER TO WRITE ABOUT A SEVERE DUTY
THAN TO PERFORM IT FOR I AM OPPRESSED WHEN I SEE AND FEEL TO WHAT A
REVERSE FATE HAS CONDEMNED ME YOU WERE KIND TO ME MONSIEUR VERY KIND
I AM AFFLICTED I AM HEART BROKEN TO BE QUITE SEPARATED FROM YOU SOON
I SHALL HAVE NO FRIEND ON EARTH
BUT IT IS USELESS TROUBLING YOU WITH MY
DISTRESSES
WHAT CLAIM HAVE I ON YOUR SYMPATHY NONE I WILL THEN SAY NO
MORE
FAREWELL MONSIEUR
F
E
HENRI
I PUT UP THE NOTE IN MY POCKET BOOK
I SLIPPED THE FIVE FRANC PIECES
INTO MY PURSE THEN I TOOK A TURN THROUGH MY NARROW CHAMBER
MDLLE
REUTER TALKED ABOUT HER POVERTY SAID I AND SHE IS POOR
YET SHE PAYS HER DEBTS AND MORE
I HAVE NOT YET GIVEN HER A QUARTER'S
LESSONS AND SHE HAS SENT ME A QUARTER'S DUE
I WONDER OF WHAT SHE
DEPRIVED HERSELF TO SCRAPE TOGETHER THE TWENTY FRANCS I WONDER WHAT
SORT OF A PLACE SHE HAS TO LIVE IN AND WHAT SORT OF A WOMAN HER AUNT
IS AND WHETHER SHE IS LIKELY TO GET EMPLOYMENT TO SUPPLY THE PLACE SHE
HAS LOST
NO DOUBT SHE WILL HAVE TO TRUDGE ABOUT LONG ENOUGH FROM SCHOOL
TO SCHOOL TO INQUIRE HERE AND APPLY THERE BE REJECTED IN THIS PLACE
DISAPPOINTED IN THAT
MANY AN EVENING SHE'LL GO TO HER BED TIRED
AND UNSUCCESSFUL
AND THE DIRECTRESS WOULD NOT LET HER IN TO BID ME
GOOD BYE I MIGHT NOT HAVE THE CHANCE OF STANDING WITH HER FOR A FEW
MINUTES AT A WINDOW IN THE SCHOOLROOM AND EXCHANGING SOME HALF DOZEN OF
SENTENCES GETTING TO KNOW WHERE SHE LIVED PUTTING MATTERS IN TRAIN
FOR HAVING ALL THINGS ARRANGED TO MY MIND NO ADDRESS ON THE NOTE I
CONTINUED DRAWING IT AGAIN FROM THE POCKET BOOK AND EXAMINING IT ON
EACH SIDE OF THE TWO LEAVES WOMEN ARE WOMEN THAT IS CERTAIN AND
ALWAYS DO BUSINESS LIKE WOMEN MEN MECHANICALLY PUT A DATE AND ADDRESS
TO THEIR COMMUNICATIONS
AND THESE FIVE FRANC PIECES I HAULED THEM
FORTH FROM MY PURSE IF SHE HAD OFFERED ME THEM HERSELF INSTEAD OF
TYING THEM UP WITH A THREAD OF GREEN SILK IN A KIND OF LILLIPUTIAN
PACKET I COULD HAVE THRUST THEM BACK INTO HER LITTLE HAND AND SHUT
UP THE SMALL TAPER FINGERS OVER THEM SO AND COMPELLED HER SHAME HER
PRIDE HER SHYNESS ALL TO YIELD TO A LITTLE BIT OF DETERMINED WILL NOW
WHERE IS SHE HOW CAN I GET AT HER
OPENING MY CHAMBER DOOR I WALKED DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN
WHO BROUGHT THE PACKET I ASKED OF THE SERVANT WHO HAD DELIVERED IT TO
ME
UN PETIT COMMISSIONAIRE MONSIEUR
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
RIEN
AND I WENDED MY WAY UP THE BACK STAIRS WONDROUSLY THE WISER FOR MY
INQUIRIES
NO MATTER SAID I TO MYSELF AS I AGAIN CLOSED THE DOOR
NO
MATTER I'LL SEEK HER THROUGH BRUSSELS
AND I DID
I SOUGHT HER DAY BY DAY WHENEVER I HAD A MOMENT'S LEISURE
FOR FOUR WEEKS I SOUGHT HER ON SUNDAYS ALL DAY LONG I SOUGHT HER ON
THE BOULEVARDS IN THE ALLEE VERTE IN THE PARK I SOUGHT HER IN STE
GUDULE AND ST
JACQUES I SOUGHT HER IN THE TWO PROTESTANT CHAPELS I
ATTENDED THESE LATTER AT THE GERMAN FRENCH AND ENGLISH SERVICES NOT
DOUBTING THAT I SHOULD MEET HER AT ONE OF THEM
ALL MY RESEARCHES WERE
ABSOLUTELY FRUITLESS MY SECURITY ON THE LAST POINT WAS PROVED BY THE
EVENT TO BE EQUALLY GROUNDLESS WITH MY OTHER CALCULATIONS
I STOOD
AT THE DOOR OF EACH CHAPEL AFTER THE SERVICE AND WAITED TILL EVERY
INDIVIDUAL HAD COME OUT SCRUTINIZING EVERY GOWN DRAPING A SLENDER FORM
PEERING UNDER EVERY BONNET COVERING A YOUNG HEAD
IN VAIN I SAW
GIRLISH FIGURES PASS ME DRAWING THEIR BLACK SCARFS OVER THEIR SLOPING
SHOULDERS BUT NONE OF THEM HAD THE EXACT TURN AND AIR OF MDLLE
HENRI'S I SAW PALE AND THOUGHTFUL FACES ENCADREES IN BANDS OF BROWN
HAIR BUT I NEVER FOUND HER FOREHEAD HER EYES HER EYEBROWS
ALL THE
FEATURES OF ALL THE FACES I MET SEEMED FRITTERED AWAY BECAUSE MY EYE
FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE PECULIARITIES IT WAS BENT UPON AN AMPLE SPACE
OF BROW AND A LARGE DARK AND SERIOUS EYE WITH A FINE BUT DECIDED LINE
OF EYEBROW TRACED ABOVE
SHE HAS PROBABLY LEFT BRUSSELS PERHAPS IS GONE TO ENGLAND AS SHE
SAID SHE WOULD MUTTERED I INWARDLY AS ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE FOURTH
SUNDAY I TURNED FROM THE DOOR OF THE CHAPEL ROYAL WHICH THE DOOR KEEPER
HAD JUST CLOSED AND LOCKED AND FOLLOWED IN THE WAKE OF THE LAST OF THE
CONGREGATION NOW DISPERSED AND DISPERSING OVER THE SQUARE
I HAD
SOON OUTWALKED THE COUPLES OF ENGLISH GENTLEMEN AND LADIES
GRACIOUS
GOODNESS WHY DON'T THEY DRESS BETTER MY EYE IS YET FILLED WITH VISIONS
OF THE HIGH FLOUNCED SLOVENLY AND TUMBLED DRESSES IN COSTLY SILK AND
SATIN OF THE LARGE UNBECOMING COLLARS IN EXPENSIVE LACE OF THE ILL CUT
COATS AND STRANGELY FASHIONED PANTALOONS WHICH EVERY SUNDAY AT THE
ENGLISH SERVICE FILLED THE CHOIRS OF THE CHAPEL ROYAL AND AFTER IT
ISSUING FORTH INTO THE SQUARE CAME INTO DISADVANTAGEOUS CONTRAST WITH
FRESHLY AND TRIMLY ATTIRED FOREIGN FIGURES HASTENING TO ATTEND SALUT
AT THE CHURCH OF COBURG I HAD PASSED THESE PAIRS OF BRITONS AND
THE GROUPS OF PRETTY BRITISH CHILDREN AND THE BRITISH FOOTMEN AND
WAITING MAIDS I HAD CROSSED THE PLACE ROYALE AND GOT INTO THE RUE
ROYALE THENCE I HAD DIVERGED INTO THE RUE DE LOUVAIN AN OLD AND QUIET
STREET
I REMEMBER THAT FEELING A LITTLE HUNGRY AND NOT DESIRING TO
GO BACK AND TAKE MY SHARE OF THE GOUTER NOW ON THE REFECTORY TABLE
AT PELET'S TO WIT PISTOLETS AND WATER I STEPPED INTO A BAKER'S AND
REFRESHED MYSELF ON A COUC IT IS A FLEMISH WORD I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO SPELL IT A CORINTHE ANGLICE A CURRANT BUN AND A CUP OF COFFEE AND
THEN I STROLLED ON TOWARDS THE PORTE DE LOUVAIN
VERY SOON I WAS OUT OF
THE CITY AND SLOWLY MOUNTING THE HILL WHICH ASCENDS FROM THE GATE I
TOOK MY TIME FOR THE AFTERNOON THOUGH CLOUDY WAS VERY SULTRY AND NOT
A BREEZE STIRRED TO REFRESH THE ATMOSPHERE
NO INHABITANT OF BRUSSELS
NEED WANDER FAR TO SEARCH FOR SOLITUDE LET HIM BUT MOVE HALF A LEAGUE
FROM HIS OWN CITY AND HE WILL FIND HER BROODING STILL AND BLANK OVER
THE WIDE FIELDS SO DREAR THOUGH SO FERTILE SPREAD OUT TREELESS AND
TRACKLESS ROUND THE CAPITAL OF BRABANT
HAVING GAINED THE SUMMIT OF THE
HILL AND HAVING STOOD AND LOOKED LONG OVER THE CULTURED BUT LIFELESS
CAMPAIGN I FELT A WISH TO QUIT THE HIGH ROAD WHICH I HAD HITHERTO
FOLLOWED AND GET IN AMONG THOSE TILLED GROUNDS FERTILE AS THE BEDS
OF A BROBDIGNAGIAN KITCHEN GARDEN SPREADING FAR AND WIDE EVEN TO THE
BOUNDARIES OF THE HORIZON WHERE FROM A DUSK GREEN DISTANCE CHANGED
THEM TO A SULLEN BLUE AND CONFUSED THEIR TINTS WITH THOSE OF THE LIVID
AND THUNDEROUS LOOKING SKY
ACCORDINGLY I TURNED UP A BY PATH TO THE
RIGHT I HAD NOT FOLLOWED IT FAR ERE IT BROUGHT ME AS I EXPECTED INTO
THE FIELDS AMIDST WHICH JUST BEFORE ME STRETCHED A LONG AND LOFTY
WHITE WALL ENCLOSING AS IT SEEMED FROM THE FOLIAGE SHOWING ABOVE SOME
THICKLY PLANTED NURSERY OF YEW AND CYPRESS FOR OF THAT SPECIES WERE
THE BRANCHES RESTING ON THE PALE PARAPETS AND CROWDING GLOOMILY ABOUT A
MASSIVE CROSS PLANTED DOUBTLESS ON A CENTRAL EMINENCE AND EXTENDING ITS
ARMS WHICH SEEMED OF BLACK MARBLE OVER THE SUMMITS OF THOSE SINISTER
TREES
I APPROACHED WONDERING TO WHAT HOUSE THIS WELL PROTECTED GARDEN
APPERTAINED I TURNED THE ANGLE OF THE WALL THINKING TO SEE SOME
STATELY RESIDENCE I WAS CLOSE UPON GREAT IRON GATES THERE WAS A
HUT SERVING FOR A LODGE NEAR BUT I HAD NO OCCASION TO APPLY FOR THE
KEY THE GATES WERE OPEN I PUSHED ONE LEAF BACK RAIN HAD RUSTED
ITS HINGES FOR IT GROANED DOLEFULLY AS THEY REVOLVED
THICK PLANTING
EMBOWERED THE ENTRANCE
PASSING UP THE AVENUE I SAW OBJECTS ON
EACH HAND WHICH IN THEIR OWN MUTE LANGUAGE OF INSCRIPTION AND SIGN
EXPLAINED CLEARLY TO WHAT ABODE I HAD MADE MY WAY
THIS WAS THE
HOUSE APPOINTED FOR ALL LIVING CROSSES MONUMENTS AND GARLANDS OF
EVERLASTINGS ANNOUNCED THE PROTESTANT CEMETERY OUTSIDE THE GATE OF
LOUVAIN
THE PLACE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO AFFORD HALF AN HOUR'S STROLLING WITHOUT
THE MONOTONY OF TREADING CONTINUALLY THE SAME PATH AND FOR THOSE WHO
LOVE TO PERUSE THE ANNALS OF GRAVEYARDS HERE WAS VARIETY OF INSCRIPTION
ENOUGH TO OCCUPY THE ATTENTION FOR DOUBLE OR TREBLE THAT SPACE OF TIME
HITHER PEOPLE OF MANY KINDREDS TONGUES AND NATIONS HAD BROUGHT THEIR
DEAD FOR INTERMENT AND HERE ON PAGES OF STONE OF MARBLE AND OF
BRASS WERE WRITTEN NAMES DATES LAST TRIBUTES OF POMP OR LOVE IN
ENGLISH IN FRENCH IN GERMAN AND LATIN
HERE THE ENGLISHMAN HAD
ERECTED A MARBLE MONUMENT OVER THE REMAINS OF HIS MARY SMITH OR JANE
BROWN AND INSCRIBED IT ONLY WITH HER NAME
THERE THE FRENCH WIDOWER HAD
SHADED THE GRAVE OF HIS ELMIRE OR CELESTINE WITH A BRILLIANT THICKET
OF ROSES AMIDST WHICH A LITTLE TABLET RISING BORE AN EQUALLY BRIGHT
TESTIMONY TO HER COUNTLESS VIRTUES
EVERY NATION TRIBE AND KINDRED
MOURNED AFTER ITS OWN FASHION AND HOW SOUNDLESS WAS THE MOURNING OF
ALL MY OWN TREAD THOUGH SLOW AND UPON SMOOTH ROLLED PATHS SEEMED TO
STARTLE BECAUSE IT FORMED THE SOLE BREAK TO A SILENCE OTHERWISE TOTAL
NOT ONLY THE WINDS BUT THE VERY FITFUL WANDERING AIRS WERE THAT
AFTERNOON AS BY COMMON CONSENT ALL FALLEN ASLEEP IN THEIR VARIOUS
QUARTERS THE NORTH WAS HUSHED THE SOUTH SILENT THE EAST SOBBED NOT
NOR DID THE WEST WHISPER
THE CLOUDS IN HEAVEN WERE CONDENSED AND
DULL BUT APPARENTLY QUITE MOTIONLESS
UNDER THE TREES OF THIS CEMETERY
NESTLED A WARM BREATHLESS GLOOM OUT OF WHICH THE CYPRESSES STOOD UP
STRAIGHT AND MUTE ABOVE WHICH THE WILLOWS HUNG LOW AND STILL WHERE
THE FLOWERS AS LANGUID AS FAIR WAITED LISTLESS FOR NIGHT DEW OR
THUNDER SHOWER WHERE THE TOMBS AND THOSE THEY HID LAY IMPASSIBLE TO
SUN OR SHADOW TO RAIN OR DROUGHT
IMPORTUNED BY THE SOUND OF MY OWN FOOTSTEPS I TURNED OFF UPON THE TURF
AND SLOWLY ADVANCED TO A GROVE OF YEWS I SAW SOMETHING STIR AMONG THE
STEMS I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A BROKEN BRANCH SWINGING MY SHORT SIGHTED
VISION HAD CAUGHT NO FORM ONLY A SENSE OF MOTION BUT THE DUSKY SHADE
PASSED ON APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING AT THE OPENINGS IN THE AVENUE
I
SOON DISCERNED IT WAS A LIVING THING AND A HUMAN THING AND DRAWING
NEARER I PERCEIVED IT WAS A WOMAN PACING SLOWLY TO AND FRO AND
EVIDENTLY DEEMING HERSELF ALONE AS I HAD DEEMED MYSELF ALONE AND
MEDITATING AS I HAD BEEN MEDITATING
ERE LONG SHE RETURNED TO A SEAT
WHICH I FANCY SHE HAD BUT JUST QUITTED OR I SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT SIGHT
OF HER BEFORE
IT WAS IN A NOOK SCREENED BY A CLUMP OF TREES THERE WAS
THE WHITE WALL BEFORE HER AND A LITTLE STONE SET UP AGAINST THE WALL
AND AT THE FOOT OF THE STONE WAS AN ALLOTMENT OF TURF FRESHLY TURNED
UP A NEW MADE GRAVE
I PUT ON MY SPECTACLES AND PASSED SOFTLY CLOSE
BEHIND HER GLANCING AT THE INSCRIPTION ON THE STONE I READ JULIENNE
HENRI DIED AT BRUSSELS AGED SIXTY
AUGUST 10TH 18 HAVING PERUSED
THE INSCRIPTION I LOOKED DOWN AT THE FORM SITTING BENT AND THOUGHTFUL
JUST UNDER MY EYES UNCONSCIOUS OF THE VICINITY OF ANY LIVING THING IT
WAS A SLIM YOUTHFUL FIGURE IN MOURNING APPAREL OF THE PLAINEST BLACK
STUFF WITH A LITTLE SIMPLE BLACK CRAPE BONNET I FELT AS WELL AS
SAW WHO IT WAS AND MOVING NEITHER HAND NOR FOOT I STOOD SOME MOMENTS
ENJOYING THE SECURITY OF CONVICTION
I HAD SOUGHT HER FOR A MONTH AND
HAD NEVER DISCOVERED ONE OF HER TRACES NEVER MET A HOPE OR SEIZED
A CHANCE OF ENCOUNTERING HER ANYWHERE
I HAD BEEN FORCED TO LOOSEN MY
GRASP ON EXPECTATION AND BUT AN HOUR AGO HAD SUNK SLACKLY UNDER
THE DISCOURAGING THOUGHT THAT THE CURRENT OF LIFE AND THE IMPULSE
OF DESTINY HAD SWEPT HER FOR EVER FROM MY REACH AND BEHOLD WHILE
BENDING SUDDENLY EARTHWARD BENEATH THE PRESSURE OF DESPONDENCY WHILE
FOLLOWING WITH MY EYES THE TRACK OF SORROW ON THE TURF OF A
GRAVEYARD HERE WAS MY LOST JEWEL DROPPED ON THE TEAR FED HERBAGE
NESTLING IN THE MESSY AND MOULDY ROOTS OF YEW TREES
FRANCES SAT VERY QUIET HER ELBOW ON HER KNEE AND HER HEAD ON HER HAND
I KNEW SHE COULD RETAIN A THINKING ATTITUDE A LONG TIME WITHOUT CHANGE
AT LAST A TEAR FELL SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THE NAME ON THE
STONE BEFORE HER AND HER HEART HAD NO DOUBT ENDURED ONE OF THOSE
CONSTRICTIONS WITH WHICH THE DESOLATE LIVING REGRETTING THE DEAD ARE
AT TIMES SO SORELY OPPRESSED
MANY TEARS ROLLED DOWN WHICH SHE WIPED
AWAY AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF SOME DISTRESSED SOBS
ESCAPED HER AND THEN THE PAROXYSM OVER SHE SAT QUIET AS BEFORE
I PUT
MY HAND GENTLY ON HER SHOULDER NO NEED FURTHER TO PREPARE HER FOR
SHE WAS NEITHER HYSTERICAL NOR LIABLE TO FAINTING FITS A SUDDEN PUSH
INDEED MIGHT HAVE STARTLED HER BUT THE CONTACT OF MY QUIET TOUCH
MERELY WOKE ATTENTION AS I WISHED AND THOUGH SHE TURNED QUICKLY YET
SO LIGHTNING SWIFT IS THOUGHT IN SOME MINDS ESPECIALLY I BELIEVE THE
WONDER OF WHAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHO IT WAS THAT THUS STOLE UNAWARES
ON HER SOLITUDE HAD PASSED THROUGH HER BRAIN AND FLASHED INTO HER
HEART EVEN BEFORE SHE HAD EFFECTED THAT HASTY MOVEMENT AT LEAST
AMAZEMENT HAD HARDLY OPENED HER EYES AND RAISED THEM TO MINE ERE
RECOGNITION INFORMED THEIR IRIDS WITH MOST SPEAKING BRIGHTNESS
NERVOUS
SURPRISE HAD HARDLY DISCOMPOSED HER FEATURES ERE A SENTIMENT OF MOST
VIVID JOY SHONE CLEAR AND WARM ON HER WHOLE COUNTENANCE
I HAD HARDLY
TIME TO OBSERVE THAT SHE WAS WASTED AND PALE ERE CALLED TO FEEL A
RESPONSIVE INWARD PLEASURE BY THE SENSE OF MOST FULL AND EXQUISITE
PLEASURE GLOWING IN THE ANIMATED FLUSH AND SHINING IN THE EXPANSIVE
LIGHT NOW DIFFUSED OVER MY PUPIL'S FACE
IT WAS THE SUMMER SUN FLASHING
OUT AFTER THE HEAVY SUMMER SHOWER AND WHAT FERTILIZES MORE RAPIDLY THAN
THAT BEAM BURNING ALMOST LIKE FIRE IN ITS ARDOUR
I HATE BOLDNESS THAT BOLDNESS WHICH IS OF THE BRASSY BROW AND INSENSATE
NERVES BUT I LOVE THE COURAGE OF THE STRONG HEART THE FERVOUR OF THE
GENEROUS BLOOD I LOVED WITH PASSION THE LIGHT OF FRANCES EVANS' CLEAR
HAZEL EYE WHEN IT DID NOT FEAR TO LOOK STRAIGHT INTO MINE I LOVED THE
TONES WITH WHICH SHE UTTERED THE WORDS
MON MAITRE MON MAITRE
I LOVED THE MOVEMENT WITH WHICH SHE CONFIDED HER HAND TO MY HAND I
LOVED HER AS SHE STOOD THERE PENNILESS AND PARENTLESS FOR A SENSUALIST
CHARMLESS FOR ME A TREASURE MY BEST OBJECT OF SYMPATHY ON EARTH
THINKING SUCH THOUGHTS AS I THOUGHT FEELING SUCH FEELINGS AS I FELT MY
IDEAL OF THE SHRINE IN WHICH TO SEAL MY STORES OF LOVE PERSONIFICATION
OF DISCRETION AND FORETHOUGHT OF DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE OF
SELF DENIAL AND SELF CONTROL THOSE GUARDIANS THOSE TRUSTY KEEPERS OF
THE GIFT I LONGED TO CONFER ON HER THE GIFT OF ALL MY AFFECTIONS
MODEL OF TRUTH AND HONOUR OF INDEPENDENCE AND CONSCIENTIOUSNESS THOSE
REFINERS AND SUSTAINERS OF AN HONEST LIFE SILENT POSSESSOR OF A WELL
OF TENDERNESS OF A FLAME AS GENIAL AS STILL AS PURE AS QUENCHLESS
OF NATURAL FEELING NATURAL PASSION THOSE SOURCES OF REFRESHMENT AND
COMFORT TO THE SANCTUARY OF HOME
I KNEW HOW QUIETLY AND HOW DEEPLY THE
WELL BUBBLED IN HER HEART I KNEW HOW THE MORE DANGEROUS FLAME BURNED
SAFELY UNDER THE EYE OF REASON I HAD SEEN WHEN THE FIRE SHOT UP A
MOMENT HIGH AND VIVID WHEN THE ACCELERATED HEAT TROUBLED LIFE'S CURRENT
IN ITS CHANNELS I HAD SEEN REASON REDUCE THE REBEL AND HUMBLE ITS
BLAZE TO EMBERS
I HAD CONFIDENCE IN FRANCES EVANS I HAD RESPECT
FOR HER AND AS I DREW HER ARM THROUGH MINE AND LED HER OUT OF THE
CEMETERY I FELT I HAD ANOTHER SENTIMENT AS STRONG AS CONFIDENCE AS
FIRM AS RESPECT MORE FERVID THAN EITHER THAT OF LOVE
WELL MY PUPIL SAID I AS THE OMINOUS SOUNDING GATE SWUNG TO BEHIND
US WELL I HAVE FOUND YOU AGAIN A MONTH'S SEARCH HAS SEEMED LONG
AND I LITTLE THOUGHT TO HAVE DISCOVERED MY LOST SHEEP STRAYING AMONGST
GRAVES
NEVER HAD I ADDRESSED HER BUT AS MADEMOISELLE BEFORE AND TO SPEAK
THUS WAS TO TAKE UP A TONE NEW TO BOTH HER AND ME
HER ANSWER SUPRISED
ME THAT THIS LANGUAGE RUFFLED NONE OF HER FEELINGS WOKE NO DISCORD IN
HER HEART
MON MAITRE SHE SAID HAVE YOU TROUBLED YOURSELF TO SEEK ME I LITTLE
IMAGINED YOU WOULD THINK MUCH OF MY ABSENCE BUT I GRIEVED BITTERLY TO
BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU
I WAS SORRY FOR THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN HEAVIER
TROUBLES OUGHT TO HAVE MADE ME FORGET IT
YOUR AUNT IS DEAD
YES A FORTNIGHT SINCE AND SHE DIED FULL OF REGRET WHICH I COULD NOT
CHASE FROM HER MIND SHE KEPT REPEATING EVEN DURING THE LAST NIGHT
OF HER EXISTENCE 'FRANCES YOU WILL BE SO LONELY WHEN I AM GONE
SO FRIENDLESS SHE WISHED TOO THAT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN BURIED IN
SWITZERLAND AND IT WAS I WHO PERSUADED HER IN HER OLD AGE TO LEAVE THE
BANKS OF LAKE LEMAN AND TO COME ONLY AS IT SEEMS TO DIE IN THIS FLAT
REGION OF FLANDERS
WILLINGLY WOULD I HAVE OBSERVED HER LAST WISH AND
TAKEN HER REMAINS BACK TO OUR OWN COUNTRY BUT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE I
WAS FORCED TO LAY HER HERE
SHE WAS ILL BUT A SHORT TIME I PRESUME
BUT THREE WEEKS
WHEN SHE BEGAN TO SINK I ASKED MDLLE
REUTER'S LEAVE
TO STAY WITH HER AND WAIT ON HER I READILY GOT LEAVE
DO YOU RETURN TO THE PENSIONNAT I DEMANDED HASTILY
MONSIEUR WHEN I HAD BEEN AT HOME A WEEK MDLLE
REUTER CALLED ONE
EVENING JUST AFTER I HAD GOT MY AUNT TO BED SHE WENT INTO HER ROOM
TO SPEAK TO HER AND WAS EXTREMELY CIVIL AND AFFABLE AS SHE ALWAYS IS
AFTERWARDS SHE CAME AND SAT WITH ME A LONG TIME AND JUST AS SHE ROSE TO
GO AWAY SHE SAID MADEMOISELLE I SHALL NOT SOON CEASE TO REGRET YOUR
DEPARTURE FROM MY ESTABLISHMENT THOUGH INDEED IT IS TRUE THAT YOU HAVE
TAUGHT YOUR CLASS OF PUPILS SO WELL THAT THEY ARE ALL QUITE ACCOMPLISHED
IN THE LITTLE WORKS YOU MANAGE SO SKILFULLY AND HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST
NEED OF FURTHER INSTRUCTION MY SECOND TEACHER MUST IN FUTURE SUPPLY
YOUR PLACE WITH REGARD TO THE YOUNGER PUPILS AS WELL AS SHE CAN
THOUGH SHE IS INDEED AN INFERIOR ARTISTE TO YOU AND DOUBTLESS IT WILL
BE YOUR PART NOW TO ASSUME A HIGHER POSITION IN YOUR CALLING I AM SURE
YOU WILL EVERYWHERE FIND SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES WILLING TO PROFIT BY YOUR
TALENTS AND THEN SHE PAID ME MY LAST QUARTER'S SALARY
I ASKED AS
MADEMOISELLE WOULD NO DOUBT THINK VERY BLUNTLY IF SHE DESIGNED TO
DISCHARGE ME FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT
SHE SMILED AT MY INELEGANCE OF
SPEECH AND ANSWERED THAT 'OUR CONNECTION AS EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYED WAS
CERTAINLY DISSOLVED BUT THAT SHE HOPED STILL TO RETAIN THE PLEASURE OF
MY ACQUAINTANCE SHE SHOULD ALWAYS BE HAPPY TO SEE ME AS A FRIEND AND
THEN SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE EXCELLENT CONDITION OF THE STREETS
AND THE LONG CONTINUANCE OF FINE WEATHER AND WENT AWAY QUITE CHEERFUL
I LAUGHED INWARDLY ALL THIS WAS SO LIKE THE DIRECTRESS SO LIKE WHAT I
HAD EXPECTED AND GUESSED OF HER CONDUCT AND THEN THE EXPOSURE AND PROOF
OF HER LIE UNCONSCIOUSLY AFFORDED BY FRANCES SHE HAD FREQUENTLY
APPLIED FOR MDLLE
HENRI'S ADDRESS FORSOOTH MDLLE
HENRI HAD ALWAYS
EVADED GIVING IT C C AND HERE I FOUND HER A VISITOR AT THE VERY
HOUSE OF WHOSE LOCALITY SHE HAD PROFESSED ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE
ANY COMMENTS I MIGHT HAVE INTENDED TO MAKE ON MY PUPIL'S COMMUNICATION
WERE CHECKED BY THE PLASHING OF LARGE RAIN DROPS ON OUR FACES AND ON THE
PATH AND BY THE MUTTERING OF A DISTANT BUT COMING STORM
THE WARNING
OBVIOUS IN STAGNANT AIR AND LEADEN SKY HAD ALREADY INDUCED ME TO TAKE
THE ROAD LEADING BACK TO BRUSSELS AND NOW I HASTENED MY OWN STEPS AND
THOSE OF MY COMPANION AND AS OUR WAY LAY DOWNHILL WE GOT ON RAPIDLY
THERE WAS AN INTERVAL AFTER THE FALL OF THE FIRST BROAD DROPS BEFORE
HEAVY RAIN CAME ON IN THE MEANTIME WE HAD PASSED THROUGH THE PORTE DE
LOUVAIN AND WERE AGAIN IN THE CITY
WHERE DO YOU LIVE I ASKED I WILL SEE YOU SAFE HOME
RUE NOTRE DAME AUX NEIGES ANSWERED FRANCES
IT WAS NOT FAR FROM THE RUE DE LOUVAIN AND WE STOOD ON THE DOORSTEPS
OF THE HOUSE WE SOUGHT ERE THE CLOUDS SEVERING WITH LOUD PEAL AND
SHATTERED CATARACT OF LIGHTNING EMPTIED THEIR LIVID FOLDS IN A TORRENT
HEAVY PRONE AND BROAD
COME IN COME IN SAID FRANCES AS AFTER PUTTING HER INTO THE HOUSE
I PAUSED ERE I FOLLOWED THE WORD DECIDED ME I STEPPED ACROSS THE
THRESHOLD SHUT THE DOOR ON THE RUSHING FLASHING WHITENING STORM AND
FOLLOWED HER UPSTAIRS TO HER APARTMENTS
NEITHER SHE NOR I WERE WET A
PROJECTION OVER THE DOOR HAD WARDED OFF THE STRAIGHT DESCENDING FLOOD
NONE BUT THE FIRST LARGE DROPS HAD TOUCHED OUR GARMENTS ONE MINUTE
MORE AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD A DRY THREAD ON US
STEPPING OVER A LITTLE MAT OF GREEN WOOL I FOUND MYSELF IN A SMALL ROOM
WITH A PAINTED FLOOR AND A SQUARE OF GREEN CARPET IN THE MIDDLE THE
ARTICLES OF FURNITURE WERE FEW BUT ALL BRIGHT AND EXQUISITELY CLEAN
ORDER REIGNED THROUGH ITS NARROW LIMITS SUCH ORDER AS IT SOOTHED MY
PUNCTILIOUS SOUL TO BEHOLD
AND I HAD HESITATED TO ENTER THE ABODE
BECAUSE I APPREHENDED AFTER ALL THAT MDLLE
REUTER'S HINT ABOUT ITS
EXTREME POVERTY MIGHT BE TOO WELL FOUNDED AND I FEARED TO EMBARRASS THE
LACE MENDER BY ENTERING HER LODGINGS UNAWARES POOR THE PLACE MIGHT BE
POOR TRULY IT WAS BUT ITS NEATNESS WAS BETTER THAN ELEGANCE AND HAD
BUT A BRIGHT LITTLE FIRE SHONE ON THAT CLEAN HEARTH I SHOULD HAVE
DEEMED IT MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN A PALACE
NO FIRE WAS THERE HOWEVER AND
NO FUEL LAID READY TO LIGHT THE LACE MENDER WAS UNABLE TO ALLOW HERSELF
THAT INDULGENCE ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN DEPRIVED BY DEATH OF HER SOLE
RELATIVE SHE HAD ONLY HER OWN UNAIDED EXERTIONS TO RELY ON
FRANCES
WENT INTO AN INNER ROOM TO TAKE OFF HER BONNET AND SHE CAME OUT A
MODEL OF FRUGAL NEATNESS WITH HER WELL FITTING BLACK STUFF DRESS SO
ACCURATELY DEFINING HER ELEGANT BUST AND TAPER WAIST WITH HER SPOTLESS
WHITE COLLAR TURNED BACK FROM A FAIR AND SHAPELY NECK WITH HER
PLENTEOUS BROWN HAIR ARRANGED IN SMOOTH BANDS ON HER TEMPLES AND IN
A LARGE GRECIAN PLAIT BEHIND ORNAMENTS SHE HAD NONE NEITHER BROOCH
RING NOR RIBBON SHE DID WELL ENOUGH WITHOUT THEM PERFECTION OF FIT
PROPORTION OF FORM GRACE OF CARRIAGE AGREEABLY SUPPLIED THEIR PLACE
HER EYE AS SHE RE ENTERED THE SMALL SITTING ROOM INSTANTLY SOUGHT
MINE WHICH WAS JUST THEN LINGERING ON THE HEARTH I KNEW SHE READ AT
ONCE THE SORT OF INWARD RUTH AND PITYING PAIN WHICH THE CHILL VACANCY OF
THAT HEARTH STIRRED IN MY SOUL QUICK TO PENETRATE QUICK TO DETERMINE
AND QUICKER TO PUT IN PRACTICE SHE HAD IN A MOMENT TIED A HOLLAND APRON
ROUND HER WAIST THEN SHE DISAPPEARED AND REAPPEARED WITH A BASKET
IT HAD A COVER SHE OPENED IT AND PRODUCED WOOD AND COAL DEFTLY AND
COMPACTLY SHE ARRANGED THEM IN THE GRATE
IT IS HER WHOLE STOCK AND SHE WILL EXHAUST IT OUT OF HOSPITALITY
THOUGHT I
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I ASKED NOT SURELY TO LIGHT A FIRE THIS
HOT EVENING I SHALL BE SMOTHERED
INDEED MONSIEUR I FEEL IT VERY CHILLY SINCE THE RAIN BEGAN BESIDES
I MUST BOIL THE WATER FOR MY TEA FOR I TAKE TEA ON SUNDAYS YOU WILL BE
OBLIGED TO TRY AND BEAR THE HEAT
SHE HAD STRUCK A LIGHT THE WOOD WAS ALREADY IN A BLAZE AND TRULY WHEN
CONTRASTED WITH THE DARKNESS THE WILD TUMULT OF THE TEMPEST WITHOUT
THAT PEACEFUL GLOW WHICH BEGAN TO BEAM ON THE NOW ANIMATED HEARTH
SEEMED VERY CHEERING
A LOW PURRING SOUND FROM SOME QUARTER ANNOUNCED
THAT ANOTHER BEING BESIDES MYSELF WAS PLEASED WITH THE CHANGE A
BLACK CAT ROUSED BY THE LIGHT FROM ITS SLEEP ON A LITTLE CUSHIONED
FOOT STOOL CAME AND RUBBED ITS HEAD AGAINST FRANCES' GOWN AS SHE KNELT
SHE CARESSED IT SAYING IT HAD BEEN A FAVOURITE WITH HER PAUVRE TANTE
JULIENNE
THE FIRE BEING LIT THE HEARTH SWEPT AND A SMALL KETTLE OF A VERY
ANTIQUE PATTERN SUCH AS I THOUGHT I REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN IN OLD
FARMHOUSES IN ENGLAND PLACED OVER THE NOW RUDDY FLAME FRANCES' HANDS
WERE WASHED AND HER APRON REMOVED IN AN INSTANT THEN SHE OPENED A
CUPBOARD AND TOOK OUT A TEA TRAY ON WHICH SHE HAD SOON ARRANGED A
CHINA TEA EQUIPAGE WHOSE PATTERN SHAPE AND SIZE DENOTED A REMOTE
ANTIQUITY A LITTLE OLD FASHIONED SILVER SPOON WAS DEPOSITED IN EACH
SAUCER AND A PAIR OF SILVER TONGS EQUALLY OLD FASHIONED WERE LAID
ON THE SUGAR BASIN FROM THE CUPBOARD TOO WAS PRODUCED A TIDY
SILVER CREAM EWER NOT LARGER THEN AN EGG SHELL
WHILE MAKING THESE
PREPARATIONS SHE CHANCED TO LOOK UP AND READING CURIOSITY IN MY EYES
SHE SMILED AND ASKED
IS THIS LIKE ENGLAND MONSIEUR
LIKE THE ENGLAND OF A HUNDRED YEARS AGO I REPLIED
IS IT TRULY WELL EVERYTHING ON THIS TRAY IS AT LEAST A HUNDRED
YEARS OLD THESE CUPS THESE SPOONS THIS EWER ARE ALL HEIRLOOMS MY
GREAT GRANDMOTHER LEFT THEM TO MY GRANDMOTHER SHE TO MY MOTHER AND MY
MOTHER BROUGHT THEM WITH HER FROM ENGLAND TO SWITZERLAND AND LEFT THEM
TO ME AND EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL I HAVE THOUGHT I SHOULD LIKE
TO CARRY THEM BACK TO ENGLAND WHENCE THEY CAME
SHE PUT SOME PISTOLETS ON THE TABLE SHE MADE THE TEA AS FOREIGNERS DO
MAKE TEA I E AT THE RATE OF A TEASPOONFUL TO HALF A DOZEN CUPS
SHE PLACED ME A CHAIR AND AS I TOOK IT SHE ASKED WITH A SORT OF
EXALTATION
WILL IT MAKE YOU THINK YOURSELF AT HOME FOR A MOMENT
IF I HAD A HOME IN ENGLAND I BELIEVE IT WOULD RECALL IT I
ANSWERED AND IN TRUTH THERE WAS A SORT OF ILLUSION IN SEEING THE
FAIR COMPLEXIONED ENGLISH LOOKING GIRL PRESIDING AT THE ENGLISH MEAL
AND SPEAKING IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
YOU HAVE THEN NO HOME WAS HER REMARK
NONE NOR EVER HAVE HAD
IF EVER I POSSESS A HOME IT MUST BE OF MY OWN
MAKING AND THE TASK IS YET TO BEGIN AND AS I SPOKE A PANG NEW TO
ME SHOT ACROSS MY HEART IT WAS A PANG OF MORTIFICATION AT THE HUMILITY
OF MY POSITION AND THE INADEQUACY OF MY MEANS WHILE WITH THAT PANG WAS
BORN A STRONG DESIRE TO DO MORE EARN MORE BE MORE POSSESS MORE
AND IN THE INCREASED POSSESSIONS MY ROUSED AND EAGER SPIRIT PANTED TO
INCLUDE THE HOME I HAD NEVER HAD THE WIFE I INWARDLY VOWED TO WIN
FRANCES' TEA WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN HOT WATER SUGAR AND MILK AND HER
PISTOLETS WITH WHICH SHE COULD NOT OFFER ME BUTTER WERE SWEET TO MY
PALATE AS MANNA
THE REPAST OVER AND THE TREASURED PLATE AND PORCELAIN BEING WASHED AND
PUT BY THE BRIGHT TABLE RUBBED STILL BRIGHTER LE CHAT DE MA TANTE
JULIENNE ALSO BEING FED WITH PROVISIONS BROUGHT FORTH ON A PLATE FOR
ITS SPECIAL USE A FEW STRAY CINDERS AND A SCATTERING OF ASHES TOO
BEING SWEPT FROM THE HEARTH FRANCES AT LAST SAT DOWN AND THEN AS SHE
TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE TO ME SHE BETRAYED FOR THE FIRST TIME A LITTLE
EMBARRASSMENT AND NO WONDER FOR INDEED I HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY WATCHED
HER RATHER TOO CLOSELY FOLLOWED ALL HER STEPS AND ALL HER MOVEMENTS
A LITTLE TOO PERSEVERINGLY WITH MY EYES FOR SHE MESMERIZED ME BY
THE GRACE AND ALERTNESS OF HER ACTION BY THE DEFT CLEANLY AND EVEN
DECORATIVE EFFECT RESULTING FROM EACH TOUCH OF HER SLIGHT AND FINE
FINGERS AND WHEN AT LAST SHE SUBSIDED TO STILLNESS THE INTELLIGENCE
OF HER FACE SEEMED BEAUTY TO ME AND I DWELT ON IT ACCORDINGLY
HER
COLOUR HOWEVER RISING RATHER THAN SETTLING WITH REPOSE AND HER EYES
REMAINING DOWNCAST THOUGH I KEPT WAITING FOR THE LIDS TO BE RAISED THAT
I MIGHT DRINK A RAY OF THE LIGHT I LOVED A LIGHT WHERE FIRE DISSOLVED
IN SOFTNESS WHERE AFFECTION TEMPERED PENETRATION WHERE JUST NOW
AT LEAST PLEASURE PLAYED WITH THOUGHT THIS EXPECTATION NOT BEING
GRATIFIED I BEGAN AT LAST TO SUSPECT THAT I HAD PROBABLY MYSELF TO
BLAME FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT I MUST CEASE GAZING AND BEGIN TALKING
IF I WISHED TO BREAK THE SPELL UNDER WHICH SHE NOW SAT MOTIONLESS SO
RECOLLECTING THE COMPOSING EFFECT WHICH AN AUTHORITATIVE TONE AND MANNER
HAD EVER BEEN WONT TO PRODUCE ON HER I SAID
GET ONE OF YOUR ENGLISH BOOKS MADEMOISELLE FOR THE RAIN YET FALLS
HEAVILY AND WILL PROBABLY DETAIN ME HALF AN HOUR LONGER
RELEASED AND SET AT EASE UP SHE ROSE GOT HER BOOK AND ACCEPTED AT
ONCE THE CHAIR I PLACED FOR HER AT MY SIDE
SHE HAD SELECTED PARADISE
LOST FROM HER SHELF OF CLASSICS THINKING I SUPPOSE THE RELIGIOUS
CHARACTER OF THE BOOK BEST ADAPTED IT TO SUNDAY I TOLD HER TO BEGIN AT
THE BEGINNING AND WHILE SHE READ MILTON'S INVOCATION TO THAT HEAVENLY
MUSE WHO ON THE SECRET TOP OF OREB OR SINAI HAD TAUGHT THE HEBREW
SHEPHERD HOW IN THE WOMB OF CHAOS THE CONCEPTION OF A WORLD HAD
ORIGINATED AND RIPENED I ENJOYED UNDISTURBED THE TREBLE PLEASURE OF
HAVING HER NEAR ME HEARING THE SOUND OF HER VOICE A SOUND SWEET AND
SATISFYING IN MY EAR AND LOOKING BY INTERVALS AT HER FACE OF THIS
LAST PRIVILEGE I CHIEFLY AVAILED MYSELF WHEN I FOUND FAULT WITH AN
INTONATION A PAUSE OR AN EMPHASIS AS LONG AS I DOGMATIZED I MIGHT
ALSO GAZE WITHOUT EXCITING TOO WARM A FLUSH
ENOUGH SAID I WHEN SHE HAD GONE THROUGH SOME HALF DOZEN PAGES A
WORK OF TIME WITH HER FOR SHE READ SLOWLY AND PAUSED OFTEN TO ASK AND
RECEIVE INFORMATION ENOUGH AND NOW THE RAIN IS CEASING AND I MUST
SOON GO FOR INDEED AT THAT MOMENT LOOKING TOWARDS THE WINDOW I
SAW IT ALL BLUE THE THUNDER CLOUDS WERE BROKEN AND SCATTERED AND THE
SETTING AUGUST SUN SENT A GLEAM LIKE THE REFLECTION OF RUBIES THROUGH
THE LATTICE
I GOT UP I DREW ON MY GLOVES
YOU HAVE NOT YET FOUND ANOTHER SITUATION TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THAT
FROM WHICH YOU WERE DISMISSED BY MDLLE
REUTER
NO MONSIEUR I HAVE MADE INQUIRIES EVERYWHERE BUT THEY ALL ASK ME
FOR REFERENCES AND TO SPEAK TRUTH I DO NOT LIKE TO APPLY TO THE
DIRECTRESS BECAUSE I CONSIDER SHE ACTED NEITHER JUSTLY NOR HONOURABLY
TOWARDS ME SHE USED UNDERHAND MEANS TO SET MY PUPILS AGAINST ME AND
THEREBY RENDER ME UNHAPPY WHILE I HELD MY PLACE IN HER ESTABLISHMENT
AND SHE EVENTUALLY DEPRIVED ME OF IT BY A MASKED AND HYPOCRITICAL
MANOEUVRE PRETENDING THAT SHE WAS ACTING FOR MY GOOD BUT REALLY
SNATCHING FROM ME MY CHIEF MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AT A CRISIS WHEN NOT
ONLY MY OWN LIFE BUT THAT OF ANOTHER DEPENDED ON MY EXERTIONS OF HER
I WILL NEVER MORE ASK A FAVOUR
HOW THEN DO YOU PROPOSE TO GET ON HOW DO YOU LIVE NOW
I HAVE STILL MY LACE MENDING TRADE WITH CARE IT WILL KEEP ME FROM
STARVATION AND I DOUBT NOT BY DINT OF EXERTION TO GET BETTER EMPLOYMENT
YET IT IS ONLY A FORTNIGHT SINCE I BEGAN TO TRY MY COURAGE OR HOPES
ARE BY NO MEANS WORN OUT YET
AND IF YOU GET WHAT YOU WISH WHAT THEN WHAT ARE YOUR ULTIMATE VIEWS
TO SAVE ENOUGH TO CROSS THE CHANNEL I ALWAYS LOOK TO ENGLAND AS MY
CANAAN
WELL WELL ERE LONG I SHALL PAY YOU ANOTHER VISIT GOOD EVENING NOW
AND I LEFT HER RATHER ABRUPTLY I HAD MUCH ADO TO RESIST A STRONG INWARD
IMPULSE URGING ME TO TAKE A WARMER MORE EXPRESSIVE LEAVE WHAT SO
NATURAL AS TO FOLD HER FOR A MOMENT IN A CLOSE EMBRACE TO IMPRINT ONE
KISS ON HER CHEEK OR FOREHEAD I WAS NOT UNREASONABLE THAT WAS ALL I
WANTED SATISFIED IN THAT POINT I COULD GO AWAY CONTENT AND REASON
DENIED ME EVEN THIS SHE ORDERED ME TO TURN MY EYES FROM HER FACE AND
MY STEPS FROM HER APARTMENT TO QUIT HER AS DRYLY AND COLDLY AS I WOULD
HAVE QUITTED OLD MADAME PELET
I OBEYED BUT I SWORE RANCOROUSLY TO BE
AVENGED ONE DAY
I'LL EARN A RIGHT TO DO AS I PLEASE IN THIS MATTER
OR I'LL DIE IN THE CONTEST
I HAVE ONE OBJECT BEFORE ME NOW TO GET THAT
GENEVESE GIRL FOR MY WIFE AND MY WIFE SHE SHALL BE THAT IS PROVIDED
SHE HAS AS MUCH OR HALF AS MUCH REGARD FOR HER MASTER AS HE HAS
FOR HER
AND WOULD SHE BE SO DOCILE SO SMILING SO HAPPY UNDER MY
INSTRUCTIONS IF SHE HAD NOT WOULD SHE SIT AT MY SIDE WHEN I DICTATE
OR CORRECT WITH SUCH A STILL CONTENTED HALCYON MIEN FOR I HAD EVER
REMARKED THAT HOWEVER SAD OR HARASSED HER COUNTENANCE MIGHT BE WHEN
I ENTERED A ROOM YET AFTER I HAD BEEN NEAR HER SPOKEN TO HER A FEW
WORDS GIVEN HER SOME DIRECTIONS UTTERED PERHAPS SOME REPROOFS SHE
WOULD ALL AT ONCE NESTLE INTO A NOOK OF HAPPINESS AND LOOK UP SERENE
AND REVIVED
THE REPROOFS SUITED HER BEST OF ALL WHILE I SCOLDED SHE
WOULD CHIP AWAY WITH HER PEN KNIFE AT A PENCIL OR A PEN FIDGETTING A
LITTLE POUTING A LITTLE DEFENDING HERSELF BY MONOSYLLABLES AND WHEN I
DEPRIVED HER OF THE PEN OR PENCIL FEARING IT WOULD BE ALL CUT AWAY
AND WHEN I INTERDICTED EVEN THE MONOSYLLABIC DEFENCE FOR THE PURPOSE
OF WORKING UP THE SUBDUED EXCITEMENT A LITTLE HIGHER SHE WOULD AT LAST
RAISE HER EYES AND GIVE ME A CERTAIN GLANCE SWEETENED WITH GAIETY AND
POINTED WITH DEFIANCE WHICH TO SPEAK TRUTH THRILLED ME AS NOTHING HAD
EVER DONE AND MADE ME IN A FASHION THOUGH HAPPILY SHE DID NOT KNOW
IT HER SUBJECT IF NOT HER SLAVE
AFTER SUCH LITTLE SCENES HER SPIRITS
WOULD MAINTAIN THEIR FLOW OFTEN FOR SOME HOURS AND AS I REMARKED
BEFORE HER HEALTH THEREFROM TOOK A SUSTENANCE AND VIGOUR WHICH
PREVIOUSLY TO THE EVENT OF HER AUNT'S DEATH AND HER DISMISSAL HAD
ALMOST RECREATED HER WHOLE FRAME
IT HAS TAKEN ME SEVERAL MINUTES TO WRITE THESE LAST SENTENCES BUT I HAD
THOUGHT ALL THEIR PURPORT DURING THE BRIEF INTERVAL OF DESCENDING THE
STAIRS FROM FRANCES' ROOM
JUST AS I WAS OPENING THE OUTER DOOR
I REMEMBERED THE TWENTY FRANCS WHICH I HAD NOT RESTORED I PAUSED
IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY THEM AWAY WITH ME DIFFICULT TO FORCE THEM BACK
ON THEIR ORIGINAL OWNER I HAD NOW SEEN HER IN HER OWN HUMBLE ABODE
WITNESSED THE DIGNITY OF HER POVERTY THE PRIDE OF ORDER THE FASTIDIOUS
CARE OF CONSERVATISM OBVIOUS IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND ECONOMY OF HER
LITTLE HOME I WAS SURE SHE WOULD NOT SUFFER HERSELF TO BE EXCUSED
PAYING HER DEBTS I WAS CERTAIN THE FAVOUR OF INDEMNITY WOULD BE
ACCEPTED FROM NO HAND PERHAPS LEAST OF ALL FROM MINE YET THESE FOUR
FIVE FRANC PIECES WERE A BURDEN TO MY SELF RESPECT AND I MUST GET
RID OF THEM
AN EXPEDIENT A CLUMSY ONE NO DOUBT BUT THE BEST I
COULD DEVISE SUGGESTED ITSELF TO ME
I DARTED UP THE STAIRS KNOCKED
RE ENTERED THE ROOM AS IF IN HASTE
MADEMOISELLE I HAVE FORGOTTEN ONE OF MY GLOVES I MUST HAVE LEFT IT
HERE
SHE INSTANTLY ROSE TO SEEK IT AS SHE TURNED HER BACK I BEING NOW
AT THE HEARTH NOISELESSLY LIFTED A LITTLE VASE ONE OF A SET OF CHINA
ORNAMENTS AS OLD FASHIONED AS THE TEA CUPS SLIPPED THE MONEY UNDER IT
THEN SAYING OH HERE IS MY GLOVE I HAD DROPPED IT WITHIN THE FENDER
GOOD EVENING MADEMOISELLE I MADE MY SECOND EXIT
BRIEF AS MY IMPROMPTU RETURN HAD BEEN IT HAD AFFORDED ME TIME TO PICK
UP A HEART ACHE I REMARKED THAT FRANCES HAD ALREADY REMOVED THE RED
EMBERS OF HER CHEERFUL LITTLE FIRE FROM THE GRATE FORCED TO CALCULATE
EVERY ITEM TO SAVE IN EVERY DETAIL SHE HAD INSTANTLY ON MY DEPARTURE
RETRENCHED A LUXURY TOO EXPENSIVE TO BE ENJOYED ALONE
I AM GLAD IT IS NOT YET WINTER THOUGHT I BUT IN TWO MONTHS MORE
COME THE WINDS AND RAINS OF NOVEMBER WOULD TO GOD THAT BEFORE THEN I
COULD EARN THE RIGHT AND THE POWER TO SHOVEL COALS INTO THAT GRATE AD
LIBITUM
ALREADY THE PAVEMENT WAS DRYING A BALMY AND FRESH BREEZE STIRRED THE
AIR PURIFIED BY LIGHTNING I FELT THE WEST BEHIND ME WHERE SPREAD A
SKY LIKE OPAL AZURE IMMINGLED WITH CRIMSON THE ENLARGED SUN GLORIOUS
IN TYRIAN TINTS DIPPED HIS BRIM ALREADY STEPPING AS I WAS EASTWARD
I FACED A VAST BANK OF CLOUDS BUT ALSO I HAD BEFORE ME THE ARCH OF AN
EVENING RAINBOW A PERFECT RAINBOW HIGH WIDE VIVID
I LOOKED LONG
MY EYE DRANK IN THE SCENE AND I SUPPOSE MY BRAIN MUST HAVE ABSORBED
IT FOR THAT NIGHT AFTER LYING AWAKE IN PLEASANT FEVER A LONG TIME
WATCHING THE SILENT SHEET LIGHTNING WHICH STILL PLAYED AMONG THE
RETREATING CLOUDS AND FLASHED SILVERY OVER THE STARS I AT LAST FELL
ASLEEP AND THEN IN A DREAM WERE REPRODUCED THE SETTING SUN THE BANK OF
CLOUDS THE MIGHTY RAINBOW
I STOOD METHOUGHT ON A TERRACE I LEANED
OVER A PARAPETED WALL THERE WAS SPACE BELOW ME DEPTH I COULD NOT
FATHOM BUT HEARING AN ENDLESS DASH OF WAVES I BELIEVED IT TO BE THE
SEA SEA SPREAD TO THE HORIZON SEA OF CHANGEFUL GREEN AND INTENSE
BLUE ALL WAS SOFT IN THE DISTANCE ALL VAPOUR VEILED
A SPARK OF GOLD
GLISTENED ON THE LINE BETWEEN WATER AND AIR FLOATED UP APPROACHED
ENLARGED CHANGED THE OBJECT HUNG MIDWAY BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
UNDER THE ARCH OF THE RAINBOW THE SOFT BUT DUSK CLOUDS DIFFUSED BEHIND
IT HOVERED AS ON WINGS PEARLY FLEECY GLEAMING AIR STREAMED LIKE
RAIMENT ROUND IT LIGHT TINTED WITH CARNATION COLOURED WHAT SEEMED
FACE AND LIMBS A LARGE STAR SHONE WITH STILL LUSTRE ON AN ANGEL'S
FOREHEAD AN UPRAISED ARM AND HAND GLANCING LIKE A RAY POINTED TO THE
BOW OVERHEAD AND A VOICE IN MY HEART WHISPERED
HOPE SMILES ON EFFORT
CHAPTER XX
A COMPETENCY WAS WHAT I WANTED A COMPETENCY IT WAS NOW MY AIM AND
RESOLVE TO SECURE BUT NEVER HAD I BEEN FARTHER FROM THE MARK
WITH
AUGUST THE SCHOOL YEAR L'ANNEE SCOLAIRE CLOSED THE EXAMINATIONS
CONCLUDED THE PRIZES WERE ADJUDGED THE SCHOOLS DISPERSED THE GATES OF
ALL COLLEGES THE DOORS OF ALL PENSIONNATS SHUT NOT TO BE REOPENED TILL
THE BEGINNING OR MIDDLE OF OCTOBER
THE LAST DAY OF AUGUST WAS AT HAND
AND WHAT WAS MY POSITION HAD I ADVANCED A STEP SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT
OF THE PAST QUARTER ON THE CONTRARY I HAD RECEDED ONE
BY RENOUNCING
MY ENGAGEMENT AS ENGLISH MASTER IN MDLLE
REUTER'S ESTABLISHMENT I HAD
VOLUNTARILY CUT OFF 20L
FROM MY YEARLY INCOME I HAD DIMINISHED MY 60L
PER ANNUM TO 40L AND EVEN THAT SUM I NOW HELD BY A VERY PRECARIOUS
TENURE
IT IS SOME TIME SINCE I MADE ANY REFERENCE TO M
PELET
THE MOONLIGHT
WALK IS I THINK THE LAST INCIDENT RECORDED IN THIS NARRATIVE WHERE
THAT GENTLEMAN CUTS ANY CONSPICUOUS FIGURE THE FACT IS SINCE THAT
EVENT A CHANGE HAD COME OVER THE SPIRIT OF OUR INTERCOURSE
HE INDEED
IGNORANT THAT THE STILL HOUR A CLOUDLESS MOON AND AN OPEN LATTICE
HAD REVEALED TO ME THE SECRET OF HIS SELFISH LOVE AND FALSE FRIENDSHIP
WOULD HAVE CONTINUED SMOOTH AND COMPLAISANT AS EVER BUT I GREW SPINY AS
A PORCUPINE AND INFLEXIBLE AS A BLACKTHORN CUDGEL I NEVER HAD A SMILE
FOR HIS RAILLERY NEVER A MOMENT FOR HIS SOCIETY HIS INVITATIONS TO
TAKE COFFEE WITH HIM IN HIS PARLOUR WERE INVARIABLY REJECTED AND
VERY STIFFLY AND STERNLY REJECTED TOO HIS JESTING ALLUSIONS TO THE
DIRECTRESS WHICH HE STILL CONTINUED WERE HEARD WITH A GRIM CALM VERY
DIFFERENT FROM THE PETULANT PLEASURE THEY WERE FORMERLY WONT TO EXCITE
FOR A LONG TIME PELET BORE WITH MY FRIGID DEMEANOUR VERY PATIENTLY
HE EVEN INCREASED HIS ATTENTIONS BUT FINDING THAT EVEN A CRINGING
POLITENESS FAILED TO THAW OR MOVE ME HE AT LAST ALTERED TOO IN
HIS TURN HE COOLED HIS INVITATIONS CEASED HIS COUNTENANCE BECAME
SUSPICIOUS AND OVERCAST AND I READ IN THE PERPLEXED YET BROODING ASPECT
OF HIS BROW A CONSTANT EXAMINATION AND COMPARISON OF PREMISES AND AN
ANXIOUS ENDEAVOUR TO DRAW THENCE SOME EXPLANATORY INFERENCE
ERE LONG
I FANCY HE SUCCEEDED FOR HE WAS NOT WITHOUT PENETRATION PERHAPS TOO
MDLLE
ZORAIDE MIGHT HAVE AIDED HIM IN THE SOLUTION OF THE ENIGMA AT
ANY RATE I SOON FOUND THAT THE UNCERTAINTY OF DOUBT HAD VANISHED FROM
HIS MANNER RENOUNCING ALL PRETENCE OF FRIENDSHIP AND CORDIALITY HE
ADOPTED A RESERVED FORMAL BUT STILL SCRUPULOUSLY POLITE DEPORTMENT
THIS WAS THE POINT TO WHICH I HAD WISHED TO BRING HIM AND I WAS NOW
AGAIN COMPARATIVELY AT MY EASE
I DID NOT IT IS TRUE LIKE MY POSITION
IN HIS HOUSE BUT BEING FREED FROM THE ANNOYANCE OF FALSE PROFESSIONS
AND DOUBLE DEALING I COULD ENDURE IT ESPECIALLY AS NO HEROIC SENTIMENT
OF HATRED OR JEALOUSY OF THE DIRECTOR DISTRACTED MY PHILOSOPHICAL SOUL
HE HAD NOT I FOUND WOUNDED ME IN A VERY TENDER POINT THE WOUND WAS SO
SOON AND SO RADICALLY HEALED LEAVING ONLY A SENSE OF CONTEMPT FOR
THE TREACHEROUS FASHION IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN INFLICTED AND A LASTING
MISTRUST OF THE HAND WHICH I HAD DETECTED ATTEMPTING TO STAB IN THE
DARK
THIS STATE OF THINGS CONTINUED TILL ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF JULY AND THEN
THERE WAS A LITTLE CHANGE PELET CAME HOME ONE NIGHT AN HOUR AFTER HIS
USUAL TIME IN A STATE OF UNEQUIVOCAL INTOXICATION A THING ANOMALOUS
WITH HIM FOR IF HE HAD SOME OF THE WORST FAULTS OF HIS COUNTRYMEN
HE HAD ALSO ONE AT LEAST OF THEIR VIRTUES I E
SOBRIETY
SO DRUNK
HOWEVER WAS HE UPON THIS OCCASION THAT AFTER HAVING ROUSED THE WHOLE
ESTABLISHMENT EXCEPT THE PUPILS WHOSE DORMITORY BEING OVER THE CLASSES
IN A BUILDING APART FROM THE DWELLING HOUSE WAS CONSEQUENTLY OUT OF THE
REACH OF DISTURBANCE BY VIOLENTLY RINGING THE HALL BELL AND ORDERING
LUNCH TO BE BROUGHT IN IMMEDIATELY FOR HE IMAGINED IT WAS NOON WHEREAS
THE CITY BELLS HAD JUST TOLLED MIDNIGHT AFTER HAVING FURIOUSLY RATED
THE SERVANTS FOR THEIR WANT OF PUNCTUALITY AND GONE NEAR TO CHASTISE
HIS POOR OLD MOTHER WHO ADVISED HIM TO GO TO BED HE BEGAN RAVING
DREADFULLY ABOUT LE MAUDIT ANGLAIS CREEMSVORT I HAD NOT YET RETIRED
SOME GERMAN BOOKS I HAD GOT HOLD OF HAD KEPT ME UP LATE I HEARD THE
UPROAR BELOW AND COULD DISTINGUISH THE DIRECTOR'S VOICE EXALTED IN
A MANNER AS APPALLING AS IT WAS UNUSUAL
OPENING MY DOOR A LITTLE I
BECAME AWARE OF A DEMAND ON HIS PART FOR CREEMSVORT TO BE BROUGHT
DOWN TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT CUT HIS THROAT ON THE HALL TABLE AND WASH
HIS HONOUR WHICH HE AFFIRMED TO BE IN A DIRTY CONDITION IN INFERNAL
BRITISH BLOOD
HE IS EITHER MAD OR DRUNK THOUGHT I AND IN EITHER
CASE THE OLD WOMAN AND THE SERVANTS WILL BE THE BETTER OF A MAN'S
ASSISTANCE SO I DESCENDED STRAIGHT TO THE HALL
I FOUND HIM STAGGERING
ABOUT HIS EYES IN A FINE FRENZY ROLLING A PRETTY SIGHT HE WAS A JUST
MEDIUM BETWEEN THE FOOL AND THE LUNATIC
COME M
PELET SAID I YOU HAD BETTER GO TO BED AND I TOOK HOLD OF
HIS ARM
HIS EXCITEMENT OF COURSE INCREASED GREATLY AT SIGHT AND TOUCH
OF THE INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOSE BLOOD HE HAD BEEN MAKING APPLICATION HE
STRUGGLED AND STRUCK WITH FURY BUT A DRUNKEN MAN IS NO MATCH FOR A
SOBER ONE AND EVEN IN HIS NORMAL STATE PELET'S WORN OUT FRAME COULD
NOT HAVE STOOD AGAINST MY SOUND ONE
I GOT HIM UP STAIRS AND IN
PROCESS OF TIME TO BED
DURING THE OPERATION HE DID NOT FAIL TO
UTTER COMMINATIONS WHICH THOUGH BROKEN HAD A SENSE IN THEM WHILE
STIGMATIZING ME AS THE TREACHEROUS SPAWN OF A PERFIDIOUS COUNTRY HE
IN THE SAME BREATH ANATHEMATIZED ZORAIDE REUTER HE TERMED HER FEMME
SOTTE ET VICIEUSE WHO IN A FIT OF LEWD CAPRICE HAD THROWN HERSELF
AWAY ON AN UNPRINCIPLED ADVENTURER DIRECTING THE POINT OF THE LAST
APPELLATION BY A FURIOUS BLOW OBLIQUELY AIMED AT ME
I LEFT HIM IN THE
ACT OF BOUNDING ELASTICALLY OUT OF THE BED INTO WHICH I HAD TUCKED HIM
BUT AS I TOOK THE PRECAUTION OF TURNING THE KEY IN THE DOOR BEHIND ME
I RETIRED TO MY OWN ROOM ASSURED OF HIS SAFE CUSTODY TILL THE MORNING
AND FREE TO DRAW UNDISTURBED CONCLUSIONS FROM THE SCENE I HAD JUST
WITNESSED
NOW IT WAS PRECISELY ABOUT THIS TIME THAT THE DIRECTRESS STUNG BY
MY COLDNESS BEWITCHED BY MY SCORN AND EXCITED BY THE PREFERENCE SHE
SUSPECTED ME OF CHERISHING FOR ANOTHER HAD FALLEN INTO A SNARE OF HER
OWN LAYING WAS HERSELF CAUGHT IN THE MESHES OF THE VERY PASSION WITH
WHICH SHE WISHED TO ENTANGLE ME
CONSCIOUS OF THE STATE OF THINGS IN
THAT QUARTER I GATHERED FROM THE CONDITION IN WHICH I SAW MY
EMPLOYER THAT HIS LADY LOVE HAD BETRAYED THE ALIENATION OF HER
AFFECTIONS INCLINATIONS RATHER I WOULD SAY AFFECTION IS A WORD AT
ONCE TOO WARM AND TOO PURE FOR THE SUBJECT HAD LET HIM SEE THAT THE
CAVITY OF HER HOLLOW HEART EMPTIED OF HIS IMAGE WAS NOW OCCUPIED BY
THAT OF HIS USHER
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT SOME SURPRISE THAT I FOUND
MYSELF OBLIGED TO ENTERTAIN THIS VIEW OF THE CASE PELET WITH
HIS OLD ESTABLISHED SCHOOL WAS SO CONVENIENT SO PROFITABLE A
MATCH ZORAIDE WAS SO CALCULATING SO INTERESTED A WOMAN I WONDERED
MERE PERSONAL PREFERENCE COULD IN HER MIND HAVE PREVAILED FOR A MOMENT
OVER WORLDLY ADVANTAGE YET IT WAS EVIDENT FROM WHAT PELET SAID THAT
NOT ONLY HAD SHE REPULSED HIM BUT HAD EVEN LET SLIP EXPRESSIONS OF
PARTIALITY FOR ME
ONE OF HIS DRUNKEN EXCLAMATIONS WAS AND THE
JADE DOATS ON YOUR YOUTH YOU RAW BLOCKHEAD AND TALKS OF YOUR NOBLE
DEPORTMENT AS SHE CALLS YOUR ACCURSED ENGLISH FORMALITY AND YOUR PURE
MORALS FORSOOTH DES MOEURS DE CATON A T ELLE DIT SOTTE HERS I
THOUGHT MUST BE A CURIOUS SOUL WHERE IN SPITE OF A STRONG NATURAL
TENDENCY TO ESTIMATE UNDULY ADVANTAGES OF WEALTH AND STATION THE
SARDONIC DISDAIN OF A FORTUNELESS SUBORDINATE HAD WROUGHT A DEEPER
IMPRESSION THAN COULD BE IMPRINTED BY THE MOST FLATTERING ASSIDUITIES OF
A PROSPEROUS CHEF D'INSTITUTION
I SMILED INWARDLY AND STRANGE TO SAY
THOUGH MY AMOUR PROPRE WAS EXCITED NOT DISAGREEABLY BY THE CONQUEST MY
BETTER FEELINGS REMAINED UNTOUCHED
NEXT DAY WHEN I SAW THE DIRECTRESS
AND WHEN SHE MADE AN EXCUSE TO MEET ME IN THE CORRIDOR AND BESOUGHT MY
NOTICE BY A DEMEANOUR AND LOOK SUBDUED TO HELOT HUMILITY I COULD
NOT LOVE I COULD SCARCELY PITY HER
TO ANSWER BRIEFLY AND DRYLY
SOME INTERESTING INQUIRY ABOUT MY HEALTH TO PASS HER BY WITH A STERN
BOW WAS ALL I COULD HER PRESENCE AND MANNER HAD THEN AND FOR SOME
TIME PREVIOUSLY AND CONSEQUENTLY A SINGULAR EFFECT UPON ME THEY
SEALED UP ALL THAT WAS GOOD ELICITED ALL THAT WAS NOXIOUS IN MY NATURE
SOMETIMES THEY ENERVATED MY SENSES BUT THEY ALWAYS HARDENED MY HEART
I WAS AWARE OF THE DETRIMENT DONE AND QUARRELLED WITH MYSELF FOR THE
CHANGE
I HAD EVER HATED A TYRANT AND BEHOLD THE POSSESSION OF A
SLAVE SELF GIVEN WENT NEAR TO TRANSFORM ME INTO WHAT I ABHORRED
THERE WAS AT ONCE A SORT OF LOW GRATIFICATION IN RECEIVING THIS LUSCIOUS
INCENSE FROM AN ATTRACTIVE AND STILL YOUNG WORSHIPPER AND AN IRRITATING
SENSE OF DEGRADATION IN THE VERY EXPERIENCE OF THE PLEASURE
WHEN SHE
STOLE ABOUT ME WITH THE SOFT STEP OF A SLAVE I FELT AT ONCE BARBAROUS
AND SENSUAL AS A PASHA
I ENDURED HER HOMAGE SOMETIMES SOMETIMES I
REBUKED IT
MY INDIFFERENCE OR HARSHNESS SERVED EQUALLY TO INCREASE THE
EVIL I DESIRED TO CHECK
QUE LE DEDAIN LUI SIED BIEN I ONCE OVERHEARD HER SAY TO HER MOTHER
IL EST BEAU COMME APOLLON QUAND IL SOURIT DE SON AIR HAUTAIN
AND THE JOLLY OLD DAME LAUGHED AND SAID SHE THOUGHT HER DAUGHTER WAS
BEWITCHED FOR I HAD NO POINT OF A HANDSOME MAN ABOUT ME EXCEPT BEING
STRAIGHT AND WITHOUT DEFORMITY
POUR MOI SHE CONTINUED IL ME FAIT
TOUT L'EFFET D'UN CHAT HUANT AVEC SES BESICLES
WORTHY OLD GIRL I COULD HAVE GONE AND KISSED HER HAD SHE NOT BEEN A
LITTLE TOO OLD TOO FAT AND TOO RED FACED HER SENSIBLE TRUTHFUL
WORDS SEEMED SO WHOLESOME CONTRASTED WITH THE MORBID ILLUSIONS OF HER
DAUGHTER
WHEN PELET AWOKE ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS FRENZY FIT HE RETAINED NO
RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND HIS MOTHER
FORTUNATELY HAD THE DISCRETION TO REFRAIN FROM INFORMING HIM THAT I HAD
BEEN A WITNESS OF HIS DEGRADATION
HE DID NOT AGAIN HAVE RECOURSE TO
WINE FOR CURING HIS GRIEFS BUT EVEN IN HIS SOBER MOOD HE SOON SHOWED
THAT THE IRON OF JEALOUSY HAD ENTERED INTO HIS SOUL
A THOROUGH
FRENCHMAN THE NATIONAL CHARACTERISTIC OF FEROCITY HAD NOT BEEN OMITTED
BY NATURE IN COMPOUNDING THE INGREDIENTS OF HIS CHARACTER IT HAD
APPEARED FIRST IN HIS ACCESS OF DRUNKEN WRATH WHEN SOME OF HIS
DEMONSTRATIONS OF HATRED TO MY PERSON WERE OF A TRULY FIENDISH
CHARACTER AND NOW IT WAS MORE COVERTLY BETRAYED BY MOMENTARY
CONTRACTIONS OF THE FEATURES AND FLASHES OF FIERCENESS IN HIS LIGHT
BLUE EYES WHEN THEIR GLANCE CHANCED TO ENCOUNTER MINE
HE ABSOLUTELY
AVOIDED SPEAKING TO ME I WAS NOW SPARED EVEN THE FALSEHOOD OF HIS
POLITENESS
IN THIS STATE OF OUR MUTUAL RELATIONS MY SOUL REBELLED
SOMETIMES ALMOST UNGOVERNABLY AGAINST LIVING IN THE HOUSE AND
DISCHARGING THE SERVICE OF SUCH A MAN BUT WHO IS FREE FROM THE
CONSTRAINT OF CIRCUMSTANCES AT THAT TIME I WAS NOT I USED TO RISE
EACH MORNING EAGER TO SHAKE OFF HIS YOKE AND GO OUT WITH MY PORTMANTEAU
UNDER MY ARM IF A BEGGAR AT LEAST A FREEMAN AND IN THE EVENING WHEN
I CAME BACK FROM THE PENSIONNAT DE DEMOISELLES A CERTAIN PLEASANT VOICE
IN MY EAR A CERTAIN FACE SO INTELLIGENT YET SO DOCILE SO REFLECTIVE
YET SO SOFT IN MY EYES A CERTAIN CAST OF CHARACTER AT ONCE PROUD
AND PLIANT SENSITIVE AND SAGACIOUS SERIOUS AND ARDENT IN MY HEAD A
CERTAIN TONE OF FEELING FERVID AND MODEST REFINED AND PRACTICAL PURE
AND POWERFUL DELIGHTING AND TROUBLING MY MEMORY VISIONS OF NEW TIES I
LONGED TO CONTRACT OF NEW DUTIES I LONGED TO UNDERTAKE HAD TAKEN THE
ROVER AND THE REBEL OUT OF ME AND HAD SHOWN ENDURANCE OF MY HATED LOT
IN THE LIGHT OF A SPARTAN VIRTUE
BUT PELET'S FURY SUBSIDED A FORTNIGHT SUFFICED FOR ITS RISE PROGRESS
AND EXTINCTION IN THAT SPACE OF TIME THE DISMISSAL OF THE OBNOXIOUS
TEACHER HAD BEEN EFFECTED IN THE NEIGHBOURING HOUSE AND IN THE SAME
INTERVAL I HAD DECLARED MY RESOLUTION TO FOLLOW AND FIND OUT MY PUPIL
AND UPON MY APPLICATION FOR HER ADDRESS BEING REFUSED I HAD SUMMARILY
RESIGNED MY OWN POST
THIS LAST ACT SEEMED AT ONCE TO RESTORE MDLLE
REUTER TO HER SENSES HER SAGACITY HER JUDGMENT SO LONG MISLED BY A
FASCINATING DELUSION STRUCK AGAIN INTO THE RIGHT TRACK THE MOMENT
THAT DELUSION VANISHED
BY THE RIGHT TRACK I DO NOT MEAN THE STEEP AND
DIFFICULT PATH OF PRINCIPLE IN THAT PATH SHE NEVER TROD BUT THE PLAIN
HIGHWAY OF COMMON SENSE FROM WHICH SHE HAD OF LATE WIDELY DIVERGED
WHEN THERE SHE CAREFULLY SOUGHT AND HAVING FOUND INDUSTRIOUSLY PURSUED
THE TRAIL OF HER OLD SUITOR M
PELET
SHE SOON OVERTOOK HIM
WHAT ARTS
SHE EMPLOYED TO SOOTHE AND BLIND HIM I KNOW NOT BUT SHE SUCCEEDED BOTH
IN ALLAYING HIS WRATH AND HOODWINKING HIS DISCERNMENT AS WAS SOON
PROVED BY THE ALTERATION IN HIS MIEN AND MANNER SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED
TO CONVINCE HIM THAT I NEITHER WAS NOR EVER HAD BEEN A RIVAL OF HIS
FOR THE FORTNIGHT OF FURY AGAINST ME TERMINATED IN A FIT OF EXCEEDING
GRACIOUSNESS AND AMENITY NOT UNMIXED WITH A DASH OF EXULTING
SELF COMPLACENCY MORE LUDICROUS THAN IRRITATING
PELET'S BACHELOR'S
LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED IN PROPER FRENCH STYLE WITH DUE DISREGARD TO MORAL
RESTRAINT AND I THOUGHT HIS MARRIED LIFE PROMISED TO BE VERY FRENCH
ALSO
HE OFTEN BOASTED TO ME WHAT A TERROR HE HAD BEEN TO CERTAIN
HUSBANDS OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE I PERCEIVED IT WOULD NOT NOW BE DIFFICULT
TO PAY HIM BACK IN HIS OWN COIN
THE CRISIS DREW ON
NO SOONER HAD THE HOLIDAYS COMMENCED THAN NOTE OF
PREPARATION FOR SOME MOMENTOUS EVENT SOUNDED ALL THROUGH THE PREMISES
OF PELET PAINTERS POLISHERS AND UPHOLSTERERS WERE IMMEDIATELY SET
TO WORK AND THERE WAS TALK OF LA CHAMBRE DE MADAME LE SALON DE
MADAME NOT DEEMING IT PROBABLE THAT THE OLD DUENNA AT PRESENT GRACED
WITH THAT TITLE IN OUR HOUSE HAD INSPIRED HER SON WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM
OF FILIAL PIETY AS TO INDUCE HIM TO FIT UP APARTMENTS EXPRESSLY FOR HER
USE I CONCLUDED IN COMMON WITH THE COOK THE TWO HOUSEMAIDS AND THE
KITCHEN SCULLION THAT A NEW AND MORE JUVENILE MADAME WAS DESTINED TO BE
THE TENANT OF THESE GAY CHAMBERS
PRESENTLY OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE COMING EVENT WAS PUT FORTH
IN
ANOTHER WEEK'S TIME M
FRANCOIS PELET DIRECTEUR AND MDLLE
ZORAIDE
REUTER DIRECTRICE WERE TO BE JOINED TOGETHER IN THE BANDS OF
MATRIMONY
MONSIEUR IN PERSON HERALDED THE FACT TO ME TERMINATING
HIS COMMUNICATION BY AN OBLIGING EXPRESSION OF HIS DESIRE THAT I SHOULD
CONTINUE AS HERETOFORE HIS ABLEST ASSISTANT AND MOST TRUSTED FRIEND
AND A PROPOSITION TO RAISE MY SALARY BY AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED FRANCS
PER ANNUM
I THANKED HIM GAVE NO CONCLUSIVE ANSWER AT THE TIME AND
WHEN HE HAD LEFT ME THREW OFF MY BLOUSE PUT ON MY COAT AND SET OUT
ON A LONG WALK OUTSIDE THE PORTE DE FLANDRE IN ORDER AS I THOUGHT TO
COOL MY BLOOD CALM MY NERVES AND SHAKE MY DISARRANGED IDEAS INTO SOME
ORDER
IN FACT I HAD JUST RECEIVED WHAT WAS VIRTUALLY MY DISMISSAL
I COULD NOT CONCEAL I DID NOT DESIRE TO CONCEAL FROM MYSELF THE
CONVICTION THAT BEING NOW CERTAIN THAT MDLLE
REUTER WAS DESTINED TO
BECOME MADAME PELET IT WOULD NOT DO FOR ME TO REMAIN A DEPENDENT DWELLER
IN THE HOUSE WHICH WAS SOON TO BE HERS
HER PRESENT DEMEANOUR TOWARDS
ME WAS DEFICIENT NEITHER IN DIGNITY NOR PROPRIETY BUT I KNEW HER FORMER
FEELING WAS UNCHANGED
DECORUM NOW REPRESSED AND POLICY MASKED IT BUT
OPPORTUNITY WOULD BE TOO STRONG FOR EITHER OF THESE TEMPTATION WOULD
SHIVER THEIR RESTRAINTS
I WAS NO POPE I COULD NOT BOAST INFALLIBILITY IN SHORT IF I STAYED
THE PROBABILITY WAS THAT IN THREE MONTHS' TIME A PRACTICAL MODERN
FRENCH NOVEL WOULD BE IN FULL PROCESS OF CONCOCTION UNDER THE ROOF OF
THE UNSUSPECTING PELET
NOW MODERN FRENCH NOVELS ARE NOT TO MY
TASTE EITHER PRACTICALLY OR THEORETICALLY
LIMITED AS HAD YET BEEN MY
EXPERIENCE OF LIFE I HAD ONCE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF CONTEMPLATING
NEAR AT HAND AN EXAMPLE OF THE RESULTS PRODUCED BY A COURSE OF
INTERESTING AND ROMANTIC DOMESTIC TREACHERY
NO GOLDEN HALO OF FICTION
WAS ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE I SAW IT BARE AND REAL AND IT WAS VERY
LOATHSOME
I SAW A MIND DEGRADED BY THE PRACTICE OF MEAN SUBTERFUGE BY
THE HABIT OF PERFIDIOUS DECEPTION AND A BODY DEPRAVED BY THE INFECTIOUS
INFLUENCE OF THE VICE POLLUTED SOUL
I HAD SUFFERED MUCH FROM THE FORCED
AND PROLONGED VIEW OF THIS SPECTACLE THOSE SUFFERINGS I DID NOT NOW
REGRET FOR THEIR SIMPLE RECOLLECTION ACTED AS A MOST WHOLESOME ANTIDOTE
TO TEMPTATION
THEY HAD INSCRIBED ON MY REASON THE CONVICTION THAT
UNLAWFUL PLEASURE TRENCHING ON ANOTHER'S RIGHTS IS DELUSIVE AND
ENVENOMED PLEASURE ITS HOLLOWNESS DISAPPOINTS AT THE TIME ITS POISON
CRUELLY TORTURES AFTERWARDS ITS EFFECTS DEPRAVE FOR EVER
FROM ALL THIS RESULTED THE CONCLUSION THAT I MUST LEAVE PELET'S AND
THAT INSTANTLY BUT SAID PRUDENCE YOU KNOW NOT WHERE TO GO NOR HOW
TO LIVE AND THEN THE DREAM OF TRUE LOVE CAME OVER ME FRANCES HENRI
SEEMED TO STAND AT MY SIDE HER SLENDER WAIST TO INVITE MY ARM HER
HAND TO COURT MY HAND I FELT IT WAS MADE TO NESTLE IN MINE I COULD NOT
RELINQUISH MY RIGHT TO IT NOR COULD I WITHDRAW MY EYES FOR EVER FROM
HERS WHERE I SAW SO MUCH HAPPINESS SUCH A CORRESPONDENCE OF HEART WITH
HEART OVER WHOSE EXPRESSION I HAD SUCH INFLUENCE WHERE I COULD KINDLE
BLISS INFUSE AWE STIR DEEP DELIGHT ROUSE SPARKLING SPIRIT AND
SOMETIMES WAKEN PLEASURABLE DREAD
MY HOPES TO WILL AND POSSESS MY
RESOLUTIONS TO MERIT AND RISE ROSE IN ARRAY AGAINST ME AND HERE I WAS
ABOUT TO PLUNGE INTO THE GULF OF ABSOLUTE DESTITUTION AND ALL THIS
SUGGESTED AN INWARD VOICE BECAUSE YOU FEAR AN EVIL WHICH MAY NEVER
HAPPEN IT WILL HAPPEN YOU KNOW IT WILL ANSWERED THAT STUBBORN
MONITOR CONSCIENCE
DO WHAT YOU FEEL IS RIGHT OBEY ME AND EVEN IN
THE SLOUGHS OF WANT I WILL PLANT FOR YOU FIRM FOOTING AND THEN AS I
WALKED FAST ALONG THE ROAD THERE ROSE UPON ME A STRANGE INLY FELT IDEA
OF SOME GREAT BEING UNSEEN BUT ALL PRESENT WHO IN HIS BENEFICENCE
DESIRED ONLY MY WELFARE AND NOW WATCHED THE STRUGGLE OF GOOD AND EVIL
IN MY HEART AND WAITED TO SEE WHETHER I SHOULD OBEY HIS VOICE HEARD IN
THE WHISPERS OF MY CONSCIENCE OR LEND AN EAR TO THE SOPHISMS BY WHICH
HIS ENEMY AND MINE THE SPIRIT OF EVIL SOUGHT TO LEAD ME ASTRAY
ROUGH AND STEEP WAS THE PATH INDICATED BY DIVINE SUGGESTION MOSSY AND
DECLINING THE GREEN WAY ALONG WHICH TEMPTATION STREWED FLOWERS BUT
WHEREAS METHOUGHT THE DEITY OF LOVE THE FRIEND OF ALL THAT EXISTS
WOULD SMILE WELL PLEASED WERE I TO GIRD UP MY LOINS AND ADDRESS MYSELF
TO THE RUDE ASCENT SO ON THE OTHER HAND EACH INCLINATION TO THE
VELVET DECLIVITY SEEMED TO KINDLE A GLEAM OF TRIUMPH ON THE BROW OF THE
MAN HATING GOD DEFYING DEMON
SHARP AND SHORT I TURNED ROUND FAST I
RETRACED MY STEPS IN HALF AN HOUR I WAS AGAIN AT M
PELET'S I SOUGHT
HIM IN HIS STUDY BRIEF PARLEY CONCISE EXPLANATION SUFFICED MY MANNER
PROVED THAT I WAS RESOLVED HE PERHAPS AT HEART APPROVED MY
DECISION
AFTER TWENTY MINUTES' CONVERSATION I RE ENTERED MY OWN ROOM
SELF DEPRIVED OF THE MEANS OF LIVING SELF SENTENCED TO LEAVE MY PRESENT
HOME WITH THE SHORT NOTICE OF A WEEK IN WHICH TO PROVIDE ANOTHER
CHAPTER XXI
DIRECTLY AS I CLOSED THE DOOR I SAW LAID ON THE TABLE TWO LETTERS MY
THOUGHT WAS THAT THEY WERE NOTES OF INVITATION FROM THE FRIENDS OF SOME
OF MY PUPILS I HAD RECEIVED SUCH MARKS OF ATTENTION OCCASIONALLY AND
WITH ME WHO HAD NO FRIENDS CORRESPONDENCE OF MORE INTEREST WAS OUT
OF THE QUESTION THE POSTMAN'S ARRIVAL HAD NEVER YET BEEN AN EVENT OF
INTEREST TO ME SINCE I CAME TO BRUSSELS
I LAID MY HAND CARELESSLY ON
THE DOCUMENTS AND COLDLY AND SLOWLY GLANCING AT THEM I PREPARED TO
BREAK THE SEALS MY EYE WAS ARRESTED AND MY HAND TOO I SAW WHAT EXCITED
ME AS IF I HAD FOUND A VIVID PICTURE WHERE I EXPECTED ONLY TO DISCOVER
A BLANK PAGE ON ONE COVER WAS AN ENGLISH POSTMARK ON THE OTHER A
LADY'S CLEAR FINE AUTOGRAPH THE LAST I OPENED FIRST
MONSIEUR
I FOUND OUT WHAT YOU HAD DONE THE VERY MORNING AFTER YOUR VISIT TO ME
YOU MIGHT BE SURE I SHOULD DUST THE CHINA EVERY DAY AND AS NO ONE BUT
YOU HAD BEEN IN MY ROOM FOR A WEEK AND AS FAIRY MONEY IS NOT CURRENT
IN BRUSSELS I COULD NOT DOUBT WHO LEFT THE TWENTY FRANCS ON THE
CHIMNEY PIECE
I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU STIR THE VASE WHEN I WAS STOOPING
TO LOOK FOR YOUR GLOVE UNDER THE TABLE AND I WONDERED YOU SHOULD
IMAGINE IT HAD GOT INTO SUCH A LITTLE CUP
NOW MONSIEUR THE MONEY
IS NOT MINE AND I SHALL NOT KEEP IT I WILL NOT SEND IT IN THIS NOTE
BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE LOST BESIDES IT IS HEAVY BUT I WILL RESTORE IT
TO YOU THE FIRST TIME I SEE YOU AND YOU MUST MAKE NO DIFFICULTIES ABOUT
TAKING IT BECAUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE I AM SURE MONSIEUR YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND THAT ONE LIKES TO PAY ONE'S DEBTS THAT IT IS SATISFACTORY
TO OWE NO MAN ANYTHING AND IN THE SECOND PLACE I CAN NOW VERY WELL
AFFORD TO BE HONEST AS I AM PROVIDED WITH A SITUATION
THIS LAST
CIRCUMSTANCE IS INDEED THE REASON OF MY WRITING TO YOU FOR IT IS
PLEASANT TO COMMUNICATE GOOD NEWS AND IN THESE DAYS I HAVE ONLY MY
MASTER TO WHOM I CAN TELL ANYTHING
A WEEK AGO MONSIEUR I WAS SENT FOR BY A MRS
WHARTON AN ENGLISH
LADY HER ELDEST DAUGHTER WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED AND SOME RICH
RELATION HAVING MADE HER A PRESENT OF A VEIL AND DRESS IN COSTLY OLD
LACE AS PRECIOUS THEY SAID ALMOST AS JEWELS BUT A LITTLE DAMAGED BY
TIME I WAS COMMISSIONED TO PUT THEM IN REPAIR
I HAD TO DO IT AT THE
HOUSE THEY GAVE ME BESIDES SOME EMBROIDERY TO COMPLETE AND NEARLY
A WEEK ELAPSED BEFORE I HAD FINISHED EVERYTHING
WHILE I WORKED MISS
WHARTON OFTEN CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SAT WITH ME AND SO DID MRS
WHARTON THEY MADE ME TALK ENGLISH ASKED HOW I HAD LEARNED TO SPEAK IT
SO WELL THEN THEY INQUIRED WHAT I KNEW BESIDES WHAT BOOKS I HAD READ
SOON THEY SEEMED TO MAKE A SORT OF WONDER OF ME CONSIDERING ME NO DOUBT
AS A LEARNED GRISETTE
ONE AFTERNOON MRS
WHARTON BROUGHT IN A PARISIAN
LADY TO TEST THE ACCURACY OF MY KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH THE RESULT OF
IT WAS THAT OWING PROBABLY IN A GREAT DEGREE TO THE MOTHER'S AND
DAUGHTER'S GOOD HUMOUR ABOUT THE MARRIAGE WHICH INCLINED THEM TO
DO BENEFICENT DEEDS AND PARTLY I THINK BECAUSE THEY ARE NATURALLY
BENEVOLENT PEOPLE THEY DECIDED THAT THE WISH I HAD EXPRESSED TO DO
SOMETHING MORE THAN MEND LACE WAS A VERY LEGITIMATE ONE AND THE SAME
DAY THEY TOOK ME IN THEIR CARRIAGE TO MRS
D 'S WHO IS THE DIRECTRESS
OF THE FIRST ENGLISH SCHOOL AT BRUSSELS
IT SEEMS SHE HAPPENED TO BE IN
WANT OF A FRENCH LADY TO GIVE LESSONS IN GEOGRAPHY HISTORY GRAMMAR
AND COMPOSITION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
MRS
WHARTON RECOMMENDED ME
VERY WARMLY AND AS TWO OF HER YOUNGER DAUGHTERS ARE PUPILS IN THE
HOUSE HER PATRONAGE AVAILED TO GET ME THE PLACE
IT WAS SETTLED THAT I
AM TO ATTEND SIX HOURS DAILY FOR HAPPILY IT WAS NOT REQUIRED THAT
I SHOULD LIVE IN THE HOUSE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY TO LEAVE MY
LODGINGS AND FOR THIS MRS
D
WILL GIVE ME TWELVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER
ANNUM
YOU SEE THEREFORE MONSIEUR THAT I AM NOW RICH RICHER ALMOST THAN
I EVER HOPED TO BE I FEEL THANKFUL FOR IT ESPECIALLY AS MY SIGHT WAS
BEGINNING TO BE INJURED BY CONSTANT WORKING AT FINE LACE AND I WAS
GETTING TOO VERY WEARY OF SITTING UP LATE AT NIGHTS AND YET NOT BEING
ABLE TO FIND TIME FOR READING OR STUDY
I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT I SHOULD
FALL ILL AND BE UNABLE TO PAY MY WAY THIS FEAR IS NOW IN A GREAT
MEASURE REMOVED AND IN TRUTH MONSIEUR I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO GOD FOR
THE RELIEF AND I FEEL IT NECESSARY ALMOST TO SPEAK OF MY HAPPINESS
TO SOME ONE WHO IS KIND HEARTED ENOUGH TO DERIVE JOY FROM SEEING OTHERS
JOYFUL
I COULD NOT THEREFORE RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF WRITING TO YOU
I ARGUED WITH MYSELF IT IS VERY PLEASANT FOR ME TO WRITE AND IT WILL
NOT BE EXACTLY PAINFUL THOUGH IT MAY BE TIRESOME TO MONSIEUR TO
READ
DO NOT BE TOO ANGRY WITH MY CIRCUMLOCUTION AND INELEGANCIES OF
EXPRESSION AND BELIEVE ME
YOUR ATTACHED PUPIL
F
E
HENRI
HAVING READ THIS LETTER I MUSED ON ITS CONTENTS FOR A FEW
MOMENTS WHETHER WITH SENTIMENTS PLEASURABLE OR OTHERWISE I WILL
HEREAFTER NOTE AND THEN TOOK UP THE OTHER
IT WAS DIRECTED IN A HAND
TO ME UNKNOWN SMALL AND RATHER NEAT NEITHER MASCULINE NOR EXACTLY
FEMININE THE SEAL BORE A COAT OF ARMS CONCERNING WHICH I COULD ONLY
DECIPHER THAT IT WAS NOT THAT OF THE SEACOMBE FAMILY CONSEQUENTLY THE
EPISTLE COULD BE FROM NONE OF MY ALMOST FORGOTTEN AND CERTAINLY QUITE
FORGETTING PATRICIAN RELATIONS
FROM WHOM THEN WAS IT I REMOVED THE
ENVELOPE THE NOTE FOLDED WITHIN RAN AS FOLLOWS
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN THE WORLD THAT YOU ARE DOING WELL IN THAT GREASY
FLANDERS LIVING PROBABLY ON THE FAT OF THE UNCTUOUS LAND SITTING LIKE
A BLACK HAIRED TAWNY SKINNED LONG NOSED ISRAELITE BY THE FLESH POTS
OF EGYPT OR LIKE A RASCALLY SON OF LEVI NEAR THE BRASS CAULDRONS OF THE
SANCTUARY AND EVERY NOW AND THEN PLUNGING IN A CONSECRATED HOOK AND
DRAWING OUT OF THE SEA OF BROTH THE FATTEST OF HEAVE SHOULDERS AND THE
FLESHIEST OF WAVE BREASTS
I KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOU NEVER WRITE TO ANY
ONE IN ENGLAND
THANKLESS DOG THAT YOU ARE I BY THE SOVEREIGN EFFICACY
OF MY RECOMMENDATION GOT YOU THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE NOW LIVING IN
CLOVER AND YET NOT A WORD OF GRATITUDE OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGMENT HAVE
YOU EVER OFFERED IN RETURN BUT I AM COMING TO SEE YOU AND SMALL
CONCEPTION CAN YOU WITH YOUR ADDLED ARISTOCRATIC BRAINS FORM OF THE
SORT OF MORAL KICKING I HAVE READY PACKED IN MY CARPET BAG DESTINED TO
BE PRESENTED TO YOU IMMEDIATELY ON MY ARRIVAL
MEANTIME I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR AFFAIRS AND HAVE JUST GOT INFORMATION
BY BROWN'S LAST LETTER THAT YOU ARE SAID TO BE ON THE POINT OF FORMING
AN ADVANTAGEOUS MATCH WITH A PURSY LITTLE BELGIAN SCHOOLMISTRESS A
MDLLE
ZENOBIE OR SOME SUCH NAME
WON'T I HAVE A LOOK AT HER WHEN I
COME OVER AND THIS YOU MAY RELY ON IF SHE PLEASES MY TASTE OR IF I
THINK IT WORTH WHILE IN A PECUNIARY POINT OF VIEW I'LL POUNCE ON YOUR
PRIZE AND BEAR HER AWAY TRIUMPHANT IN SPITE OF YOUR TEETH
YET I DON'T
LIKE DUMPIES EITHER AND BROWN SAYS SHE IS LITTLE AND STOUT THE BETTER
FITTED FOR A WIRY STARVED LOOKING CHAP LIKE YOU
BE ON THE LOOK OUT
FOR YOU KNOW NEITHER THE DAY NOR HOUR WHEN YOUR I DON'T WISH TO
BLASPHEME SO I'LL LEAVE A BLANK COMETH
YOURS TRULY
HUNSDEN YORKE HUNSDEN
HUMPH SAID I AND ERE I LAID THE LETTER DOWN I AGAIN GLANCED AT THE
SMALL NEAT HANDWRITING NOT A BIT LIKE THAT OF A MERCANTILE MAN NOR
INDEED OF ANY MAN EXCEPT HUNSDEN HIMSELF
THEY TALK OF AFFINITIES
BETWEEN THE AUTOGRAPH AND THE CHARACTER WHAT AFFINITY WAS THERE HERE
I RECALLED THE WRITER'S PECULIAR FACE AND CERTAIN TRAITS I SUSPECTED
RATHER THAN KNEW TO APPERTAIN TO HIS NATURE AND I ANSWERED A GREAT
DEAL
HUNSDEN THEN WAS COMING TO BRUSSELS AND COMING I KNEW NOT WHEN
COMING CHARGED WITH THE EXPECTATION OF FINDING ME ON THE SUMMIT OF
PROSPERITY ABOUT TO BE MARRIED TO STEP INTO A WARM NEST TO LIE
COMFORTABLY DOWN BY THE SIDE OF A SNUG WELL FED LITTLE MATE
I WISH HIM JOY OF THE FIDELITY OF THE PICTURE HE HAS PAINTED THOUGHT
I
WHAT WILL HE SAY WHEN INSTEAD OF A PAIR OF PLUMP TURTLE DOVES
BILLING AND COOING IN A BOWER OF ROSES HE FINDS A SINGLE LEAN
CORMORANT STANDING MATELESS AND SHELTERLESS ON POVERTY'S BLEAK CLIFF
OH CONFOUND HIM LET HIM COME AND LET HIM LAUGH AT THE CONTRAST
BETWEEN RUMOUR AND FACT
WERE HE THE DEVIL HIMSELF INSTEAD OF BEING
MERELY VERY LIKE HIM I'D NOT CONDESCEND TO GET OUT OF HIS WAY OR TO
FORGE A SMILE OR A CHEERFUL WORD WHEREWITH TO AVERT HIS SARCASM
THEN I RECURRED TO THE OTHER LETTER THAT STRUCK A CHORD WHOSE SOUND I
COULD NOT DEADEN BY THRUSTING MY FINGERS INTO MY EARS FOR IT VIBRATED
WITHIN AND THOUGH ITS SWELL MIGHT BE EXQUISITE MUSIC ITS CADENCE WAS A
GROAN
THAT FRANCES WAS RELIEVED FROM THE PRESSURE OF WANT THAT THE CURSE OF
EXCESSIVE LABOUR WAS TAKEN OFF HER FILLED ME WITH HAPPINESS THAT HER
FIRST THOUGHT IN PROSPERITY SHOULD BE TO AUGMENT HER JOY BY SHARING
IT WITH ME MET AND SATISFIED THE WISH OF MY HEART
TWO RESULTS OF HER
LETTER WERE THEN PLEASANT SWEET AS TWO DRAUGHTS OF NECTAR BUT APPLYING
MY LIPS FOR THE THIRD TIME TO THE CUP AND THEY WERE EXCORIATED AS WITH
VINEGAR AND GALL
TWO PERSONS WHOSE DESIRES ARE MODERATE MAY LIVE WELL ENOUGH IN BRUSSELS
ON AN INCOME WHICH WOULD SCARCELY AFFORD A RESPECTABLE MAINTENANCE FOR
ONE IN LONDON AND THAT NOT BECAUSE THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE ARE SO
MUCH DEARER IN THE LATTER CAPITAL OR TAXES SO MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE
FORMER BUT BECAUSE THE ENGLISH SURPASS IN FOLLY ALL THE NATIONS ON
GOD'S EARTH AND ARE MORE ABJECT SLAVES TO CUSTOM TO OPINION TO
THE DESIRE TO KEEP UP A CERTAIN APPEARANCE THAN THE ITALIANS ARE TO
PRIESTCRAFT THE FRENCH TO VAIN GLORY THE RUSSIANS TO THEIR CZAR OR
THE GERMANS TO BLACK BEER
I HAVE SEEN A DEGREE OF SENSE IN THE MODEST
ARRANGEMENT OF ONE HOMELY BELGIAN HOUSEHOLD THAT MIGHT PUT TO SHAME THE
ELEGANCE THE SUPERFLUITIES THE LUXURIES THE STRAINED REFINEMENTS OF
A HUNDRED GENTEEL ENGLISH MANSIONS
IN BELGIUM PROVIDED YOU CAN
MAKE MONEY YOU MAY SAVE IT THIS IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE IN ENGLAND
OSTENTATION THERE LAVISHES IN A MONTH WHAT INDUSTRY HAS EARNED IN A
YEAR
MORE SHAME TO ALL CLASSES IN THAT MOST BOUNTIFUL AND BEGGARLY
COUNTRY FOR THEIR SERVILE FOLLOWING OF FASHION I COULD WRITE A CHAPTER
OR TWO ON THIS SUBJECT BUT MUST FORBEAR AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT
HAD
I RETAINED MY 60L
PER ANNUM I COULD NOW THAT FRANCES WAS IN POSSESSION
OF 50L HAVE GONE STRAIGHT TO HER THIS VERY EVENING AND SPOKEN OUT THE
WORDS WHICH REPRESSED KEPT FRETTING MY HEART WITH FEVER OUR UNITED
INCOME WOULD AS WE SHOULD HAVE MANAGED IT HAVE SUFFICED WELL FOR
OUR MUTUAL SUPPORT SINCE WE LIVED IN A COUNTRY WHERE ECONOMY WAS NOT
CONFOUNDED WITH MEANNESS WHERE FRUGALITY IN DRESS FOOD AND FURNITURE
WAS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH VULGARITY IN THESE VARIOUS POINTS
BUT THE
PLACELESS USHER BARE OF RESOURCE AND UNSUPPORTED BY CONNECTIONS MUST
NOT THINK OF THIS SUCH A SENTIMENT AS LOVE SUCH A WORD AS MARRIAGE
WERE MISPLACED IN HIS HEART AND ON HIS LIPS
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME DID
I TRULY FEEL WHAT IT WAS TO BE POOR NOW DID THE SACRIFICE I HAD MADE
IN CASTING FROM ME THE MEANS OF LIVING PUT ON A NEW ASPECT INSTEAD OF
A CORRECT JUST HONOURABLE ACT IT SEEMED A DEED AT ONCE LIGHT AND
FANATICAL I TOOK SEVERAL TURNS IN MY ROOM UNDER THE GOADING INFLUENCE
OF MOST POIGNANT REMORSE I WALKED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FROM THE WALL TO
THE WINDOW AND AT THE WINDOW SELF REPROACH SEEMED TO FACE ME AT THE
WALL SELF DISDAIN ALL AT ONCE OUT SPOKE CONSCIENCE
DOWN STUPID TORMENTERS CRIED SHE THE MAN HAS DONE HIS DUTY
YOU SHALL NOT BAIT HIM THUS BY THOUGHTS OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HE
RELINQUISHED A TEMPORARY AND CONTINGENT GOOD TO AVOID A PERMANENT AND
CERTAIN EVIL HE DID WELL
LET HIM REFLECT NOW AND WHEN YOUR BLINDING
DUST AND DEAFENING HUM SUBSIDE HE WILL DISCOVER A PATH
I SAT DOWN I PROPPED MY FOREHEAD ON BOTH MY HANDS I THOUGHT AND
THOUGHT AN HOUR TWO HOURS VAINLY
I SEEMED LIKE ONE SEALED IN A
SUBTERRANEAN VAULT WHO GAZES AT UTTER BLACKNESS AT BLACKNESS ENSURED
BY YARD THICK STONE WALLS AROUND AND BY PILES OF BUILDING ABOVE
EXPECTING LIGHT TO PENETRATE THROUGH GRANITE AND THROUGH CEMENT FIRM
AS GRANITE
BUT THERE ARE CHINKS OR THERE MAY BE CHINKS IN THE
BEST ADJUSTED MASONRY THERE WAS A CHINK IN MY CAVERNOUS CELL FOR
EVENTUALLY I SAW OR SEEMED TO SEE A RAY PALLID INDEED AND COLD
AND DOUBTFUL BUT STILL A RAY FOR IT SHOWED THAT NARROW PATH WHICH
CONSCIENCE HAD PROMISED AFTER TWO THREE HOURS' TORTURING RESEARCH IN
BRAIN AND MEMORY I DISINTERRED CERTAIN REMAINS OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND
CONCEIVED A HOPE THAT BY PUTTING THEM TOGETHER AN EXPEDIENT MIGHT BE
FRAMED AND A RESOURCE DISCOVERED
THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE BRIEFLY THESE
SOME THREE MONTHS AGO M
PELET HAD ON THE OCCASION OF HIS FETE GIVEN
THE BOYS A TREAT WHICH TREAT CONSISTED IN A PARTY OF PLEASURE TO A
CERTAIN PLACE OF PUBLIC RESORT IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF BRUSSELS OF WHICH
I DO NOT AT THIS MOMENT REMEMBER THE NAME BUT NEAR IT WERE SEVERAL OF
THOSE LAKELETS CALLED ETANGS AND THERE WAS ONE ETANG LARGER THAN THE
REST WHERE ON HOLIDAYS PEOPLE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO AMUSE THEMSELVES BY
ROWING ROUND IT IN LITTLE BOATS
THE BOYS HAVING EATEN AN UNLIMITED
QUANTITY OF GAUFRES AND DRANK SEVERAL BOTTLES OF LOUVAIN BEER AMID
THE SHADES OF A GARDEN MADE AND PROVIDED FOR SUCH CRAMS PETITIONED
THE DIRECTOR FOR LEAVE TO TAKE A ROW ON THE ETANG
HALF A DOZEN OF THE
ELDEST SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING LEAVE AND I WAS COMMISSIONED TO ACCOMPANY
THEM AS SURVEILLANT
AMONG THE HALF DOZEN HAPPENED TO BE A CERTAIN JEAN
BAPTISTE VANDENHUTEN A MOST PONDEROUS YOUNG FLAMAND NOT TALL BUT
EVEN NOW AT THE EARLY AGE OF SIXTEEN POSSESSING A BREADTH AND DEPTH OF
PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT TRULY NATIONAL
IT CHANCED THAT JEAN WAS THE FIRST
LAD TO STEP INTO THE BOAT HE STUMBLED ROLLED TO ONE SIDE THE BOAT
REVOLTED AT HIS WEIGHT AND CAPSIZED
VANDENHUTEN SANK LIKE LEAD ROSE
SANK AGAIN
MY COAT AND WAISTCOAT WERE OFF IN AN INSTANT I HAD NOT BEEN
BROUGHT UP AT ETON AND BOATED AND BATHED AND SWAM THERE TEN LONG YEARS
FOR NOTHING IT WAS A NATURAL AND EASY ACT FOR ME TO LEAP TO THE RESCUE
THE LADS AND THE BOATMEN YELLED THEY THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE TWO DEATHS
BY DROWNING INSTEAD OF ONE BUT AS JEAN ROSE THE THIRD TIME I CLUTCHED
HIM BY ONE LEG AND THE COLLAR AND IN THREE MINUTES MORE BOTH HE AND I
WERE SAFE LANDED
TO SPEAK HEAVEN'S TRUTH MY MERIT IN THE ACTION WAS
SMALL INDEED FOR I HAD RUN NO RISK AND SUBSEQUENTLY DID NOT EVEN CATCH
COLD FROM THE WETTING BUT WHEN M
AND MADAME VANDENHUTEN OF WHOM JEAN
BAPTISTE WAS THE SOLE HOPE CAME TO HEAR OF THE EXPLOIT THEY SEEMED
TO THINK I HAD EVINCED A BRAVERY AND DEVOTION WHICH NO THANKS COULD
SUFFICIENTLY REPAY
MADAME IN PARTICULAR WAS CERTAIN I MUST HAVE
DEARLY LOVED THEIR SWEET SON OR I WOULD NOT THUS HAVE HAZARDED MY OWN
LIFE TO SAVE HIS MONSIEUR AN HONEST LOOKING THOUGH PHLEGMATIC MAN
SAID VERY LITTLE BUT HE WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO LEAVE THE ROOM TILL
I HAD PROMISED THAT IN CASE I EVER STOOD IN NEED OF HELP I WOULD BY
APPLYING TO HIM GIVE HIM A CHANCE OF DISCHARGING THE OBLIGATION UNDER
WHICH HE AFFIRMED I HAD LAID HIM
THESE WORDS THEN WERE MY GLIMMER OF
LIGHT IT WAS HERE I FOUND MY SOLE OUTLET AND IN TRUTH THOUGH THE COLD
LIGHT ROUSED IT DID NOT CHEER ME NOR DID THE OUTLET SEEM SUCH AS I
SHOULD LIKE TO PASS THROUGH
RIGHT I HAD NONE TO M
VANDENHUTEN'S GOOD
OFFICES IT WAS NOT ON THE GROUND OF MERIT I COULD APPLY TO HIM NO I
MUST STAND ON THAT OF NECESSITY I HAD NO WORK I WANTED WORK MY BEST
CHANCE OF OBTAINING IT LAY IN SECURING HIS RECOMMENDATION
THIS I KNEW
COULD BE HAD BY ASKING FOR IT NOT TO ASK BECAUSE THE REQUEST REVOLTED
MY PRIDE AND CONTRADICTED MY HABITS WOULD I FELT BE AN INDULGENCE OF
FALSE AND INDOLENT FASTIDIOUSNESS
I MIGHT REPENT THE OMISSION ALL MY
LIFE I WOULD NOT THEN BE GUILTY OF IT
THAT EVENING I WENT TO M
VANDENHUTEN'S BUT I HAD BENT THE BOW AND
ADJUSTED THE SHAFT IN VAIN THE STRING BROKE
I RANG THE BELL AT THE
GREAT DOOR IT WAS A LARGE HANDSOME HOUSE IN AN EXPENSIVE PART OF THE
TOWN A MANSERVANT OPENED I ASKED FOR M
VANDENHUTEN M
VANDENHUTEN
AND FAMILY WERE ALL OUT OF TOWN GONE TO OSTEND DID NOT KNOW WHEN THEY
WOULD BE BACK
I LEFT MY CARD AND RETRACED MY STEPS
CHAPTER XXII
A WEEK IS GONE LE JOUR DES NOCES ARRIVED THE MARRIAGE WAS SOLEMNIZED
AT ST
JACQUES MDLLE
ZORAIDE BECAME MADAME PELET NEE REUTER AND IN
ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER THIS TRANSFORMATION THE HAPPY PAIR AS NEWSPAPERS
PHRASE IT WERE ON THEIR WAY TO PARIS WHERE ACCORDING TO PREVIOUS
ARRANGEMENT THE HONEYMOON WAS TO BE SPENT
THE NEXT DAY I QUITTED THE
PENSIONNAT
MYSELF AND MY CHATTELS SOME BOOKS AND CLOTHES WERE SOON
TRANSFERRED TO A MODEST LODGING I HAD HIRED IN A STREET NOT FAR OFF
IN
HALF AN HOUR MY CLOTHES WERE ARRANGED IN A COMMODE MY BOOKS ON A SHELF
AND THE FLITTING WAS EFFECTED
I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNHAPPY THAT DAY
HAD NOT ONE PANG TORTURED ME A LONGING TO GO TO THE RUE NOTRE DAME
AUX NEIGES RESISTED YET IRRITATED BY AN INWARD RESOLVE TO AVOID
THAT STREET TILL SUCH TIME AS THE MIST OF DOUBT SHOULD CLEAR FROM MY
PROSPECTS
IT WAS A SWEET SEPTEMBER EVENING VERY MILD VERY STILL I HAD NOTHING
TO DO AT THAT HOUR I KNEW FRANCES WOULD BE EQUALLY RELEASED FROM
OCCUPATION I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE WISHING FOR HER MASTER I
KNEW I WISHED FOR MY PUPIL
IMAGINATION BEGAN WITH HER LOW WHISPERS
INFUSING INTO MY SOUL THE SOFT TALE OF PLEASURES THAT MIGHT BE
YOU WILL FIND HER READING OR WRITING SAID SHE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR
SEAT AT HER SIDE YOU NEED NOT STARTLE HER PEACE BY UNDUE EXCITEMENT
YOU NEED NOT EMBARRASS HER MANNER BY UNUSUAL ACTION OR LANGUAGE
BE AS
YOU ALWAYS ARE LOOK OVER WHAT SHE HAS WRITTEN LISTEN WHILE SHE READS
CHIDE HER OR QUIETLY APPROVE YOU KNOW THE EFFECT OF EITHER SYSTEM YOU
KNOW HER SMILE WHEN PLEASED YOU KNOW THE PLAY OF HER LOOKS WHEN ROUSED
YOU HAVE THE SECRET OF AWAKENING WHAT EXPRESSION YOU WILL AND YOU CAN
CHOOSE AMONGST THAT PLEASANT VARIETY
WITH YOU SHE WILL SIT SILENT AS
LONG AS IT SUITS YOU TO TALK ALONE YOU CAN HOLD HER UNDER A POTENT
SPELL INTELLIGENT AS SHE IS ELOQUENT AS SHE CAN BE YOU CAN SEAL HER
LIPS AND VEIL HER BRIGHT COUNTENANCE WITH DIFFIDENCE YET YOU KNOW
SHE IS NOT ALL MONOTONOUS MILDNESS YOU HAVE SEEN WITH A SORT OF
STRANGE PLEASURE REVOLT SCORN AUSTERITY BITTERNESS LAY ENERGETIC
CLAIM TO A PLACE IN HER FEELINGS AND PHYSIOGNOMY YOU KNOW THAT FEW
COULD RULE HER AS YOU DO YOU KNOW SHE MIGHT BREAK BUT NEVER BEND UNDER
THE HAND OF TYRANNY AND INJUSTICE BUT REASON AND AFFECTION CAN GUIDE
HER BY A SIGN
TRY THEIR INFLUENCE NOW
GO THEY ARE NOT PASSIONS YOU
MAY HANDLE THEM SAFELY
I WILL NOT GO WAS MY ANSWER TO THE SWEET TEMPTRESS
A MAN IS MASTER
OF HIMSELF TO A CERTAIN POINT BUT NOT BEYOND IT
COULD I SEEK FRANCES
TO NIGHT COULD I SIT WITH HER ALONE IN A QUIET ROOM AND ADDRESS HER
ONLY IN THE LANGUAGE OF REASON AND AFFECTION
NO WAS THE BRIEF FERVENT REPLY OF THAT LOVE WHICH HAD CONQUERED AND
NOW CONTROLLED ME
TIME SEEMED TO STAGNATE THE SUN WOULD NOT GO DOWN MY WATCH TICKED BUT
I THOUGHT THE HANDS WERE PARALYZED
WHAT A HOT EVENING I CRIED THROWING OPEN THE LATTICE FOR INDEED I
HAD SELDOM FELT SO FEVERISH
HEARING A STEP ASCENDING THE COMMON STAIR
I WONDERED WHETHER THE LOCATAIRE NOW MOUNTING TO HIS APARTMENTS WERE
AS UNSETTLED IN MIND AND CONDITION AS I WAS OR WHETHER HE LIVED IN THE
CALM OF CERTAIN RESOURCES AND IN THE FREEDOM OF UNFETTERED FEELINGS
WHAT WAS HE COMING IN PERSON TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM HARDLY PROPOSED IN
INAUDIBLE THOUGHT HE HAD ACTUALLY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AT MY DOOR A
SMART PROMPT RAP AND ALMOST BEFORE I COULD INVITE HIM IN HE WAS OVER
THE THRESHOLD AND HAD CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
AND HOW ARE YOU ASKED AN INDIFFERENT QUIET VOICE IN THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE WHILE MY VISITOR WITHOUT ANY SORT OF BUSTLE OR INTRODUCTION
PUT HIS HAT ON THE TABLE AND HIS GLOVES INTO HIS HAT AND DRAWING
THE ONLY ARMCHAIR THE ROOM AFFORDED A LITTLE FORWARD SEATED HIMSELF
TRANQUILLY THEREIN
CAN'T YOU SPEAK HE INQUIRED IN A FEW MOMENTS IN A TONE WHOSE
NONCHALANCE SEEMED TO INTIMATE THAT IT WAS MUCH THE SAME THING WHETHER
I ANSWERED OR NOT
THE FACT IS I FOUND IT DESIRABLE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO
MY GOOD FRIENDS LES BESICLES NOT EXACTLY TO ASCERTAIN THE IDENTITY OF
MY VISITOR FOR I ALREADY KNEW HIM CONFOUND HIS IMPUDENCE BUT TO SEE
HOW HE LOOKED TO GET A CLEAR NOTION OF HIS MIEN AND COUNTENANCE
I WIPED THE GLASSES VERY DELIBERATELY AND PUT THEM ON QUITE AS
DELIBERATELY ADJUSTING THEM SO AS NOT TO HURT THE BRIDGE OF MY NOSE
OR GET ENTANGLED IN MY SHORT TUFTS OF DUN HAIR
I WAS SITTING IN THE
WINDOW SEAT WITH MY BACK TO THE LIGHT AND I HAD HIM VIS A VIS A
POSITION HE WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE HAD REVERSED FOR AT ANY TIME HE
PREFERRED SCRUTINIZING TO BEING SCRUTINIZED
YES IT WAS HE AND NO
MISTAKE WITH HIS SIX FEET OF LENGTH ARRANGED IN A SITTING ATTITUDE
WITH HIS DARK TRAVELLING SURTOUT WITH ITS VELVET COLLAR HIS GRAY
PANTALOONS HIS BLACK STOCK AND HIS FACE THE MOST ORIGINAL ONE NATURE
EVER MODELLED YET THE LEAST OBTRUSIVELY SO NOT ONE FEATURE THAT COULD
BE TERMED MARKED OR ODD YET THE EFFECT OF THE WHOLE UNIQUE
THERE IS NO
USE IN ATTEMPTING TO DESCRIBE WHAT IS INDESCRIBABLE
BEING IN NO HURRY
TO ADDRESS HIM I SAT AND STARED AT MY EASE
OH THAT'S YOUR GAME IS IT SAID HE AT LAST
WELL WE'LL SEE WHICH
IS SOONEST TIRED AND HE SLOWLY DREW OUT A FINE CIGAR CASE PICKED ONE
TO HIS TASTE LIT IT TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELF CONVENIENT TO HIS HAND
THEN LEANING BACK PROCEEDED TO SMOKE AND READ AS TRANQUILLY AS IF HE
HAD BEEN IN HIS OWN ROOM IN GROVE STREET X SHIRE ENGLAND
I KNEW
HE WAS CAPABLE OF CONTINUING IN THAT ATTITUDE TILL MIDNIGHT IF HE
CONCEIVED THE WHIM SO I ROSE AND TAKING THE BOOK FROM HIS HAND I
SAID
YOU DID NOT ASK FOR IT AND YOU SHALL NOT HAVE IT
IT IS SILLY AND DULL HE OBSERVED SO I HAVE NOT LOST MUCH THEN THE
SPELL BEING BROKEN HE WENT ON I THOUGHT YOU LIVED AT PELET'S I WENT
THERE THIS AFTERNOON EXPECTING TO BE STARVED TO DEATH BY SITTING IN
A BOARDING SCHOOL DRAWING ROOM AND THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE GONE HAD
DEPARTED THIS MORNING YOU HAD LEFT YOUR ADDRESS BEHIND YOU THOUGH
WHICH I WONDERED AT IT WAS A MORE PRACTICAL AND SENSIBLE PRECAUTION
THAN I SHOULD HAVE IMAGINED YOU CAPABLE OF
WHY DID YOU LEAVE
BECAUSE M
PELET HAS JUST MARRIED THE LADY WHOM YOU AND MR
BROWN
ASSIGNED TO ME AS MY WIFE
OH INDEED REPLIED HUNSDEN WITH A SHORT LAUGH SO YOU'VE LOST BOTH
YOUR WIFE AND YOUR PLACE
PRECISELY SO
I SAW HIM GIVE A QUICK COVERT GLANCE ALL ROUND MY ROOM HE MARKED ITS
NARROW LIMITS ITS SCANTY FURNITURE IN AN INSTANT HE HAD COMPREHENDED
THE STATE OF MATTERS HAD ABSOLVED ME FROM THE CRIME OF PROSPERITY
A
CURIOUS EFFECT THIS DISCOVERY WROUGHT IN HIS STRANGE MIND I AM MORALLY
CERTAIN THAT IF HE HAD FOUND ME INSTALLED IN A HANDSOME PARLOUR
LOUNGING ON A SOFT COUCH WITH A PRETTY WEALTHY WIFE AT MY SIDE HE
WOULD HAVE HATED ME A BRIEF COLD HAUGHTY VISIT WOULD IN SUCH A CASE
HAVE BEEN THE EXTREME LIMIT OF HIS CIVILITIES AND NEVER WOULD HE HAVE
COME NEAR ME MORE SO LONG AS THE TIDE OF FORTUNE BORE ME SMOOTHLY ON
ITS SURFACE BUT THE PAINTED FURNITURE THE BARE WALLS THE CHEERLESS
SOLITUDE OF MY ROOM RELAXED HIS RIGID PRIDE AND I KNOW NOT WHAT
SOFTENING CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE BOTH IN HIS VOICE AND LOOK ERE HE SPOKE
AGAIN
YOU HAVE GOT ANOTHER PLACE
NO
YOU ARE IN THE WAY OF GETTING ONE
NO
THAT IS BAD HAVE YOU APPLIED TO BROWN
NO INDEED
YOU HAD BETTER HE OFTEN HAS IT IN HIS POWER TO GIVE USEFUL INFORMATION
IN SUCH MATTERS
HE SERVED ME ONCE VERY WELL I HAVE NO CLAIM ON HIM AND AM NOT IN THE
HUMOUR TO BOTHER HIM AGAIN
OH IF YOU'RE BASHFUL AND DREAD BEING INTRUSIVE YOU NEED ONLY
COMMISSION ME
I SHALL SEE HIM TO NIGHT I CAN PUT IN A WORD
I BEG YOU WILL NOT MR
HUNSDEN I AM IN YOUR DEBT ALREADY YOU DID ME
AN IMPORTANT SERVICE WHEN I WAS AT X GOT ME OUT OF A DEN WHERE I
WAS DYING THAT SERVICE I HAVE NEVER REPAID AND AT PRESENT I DECLINE
POSITIVELY ADDING ANOTHER ITEM TO THE ACCOUNT
IF THE WIND SITS THAT WAY I'M SATISFIED
I THOUGHT MY UNEXAMPLED
GENEROSITY IN TURNING YOU OUT OF THAT ACCURSED COUNTING HOUSE WOULD BE
DULY APPRECIATED SOME DAY 'CAST YOUR BREAD ON THE WATERS AND IT
SHALL BE FOUND AFTER MANY DAYS SAY THE SCRIPTURES
YES THAT'S RIGHT
LAD MAKE MUCH OF ME I'M A NONPAREIL THERE'S NOTHING LIKE ME IN THE
COMMON HERD
IN THE MEANTIME TO PUT ALL HUMBUG ASIDE AND TALK SENSE FOR
A FEW MOMENTS YOU WOULD BE GREATLY THE BETTER OF A SITUATION AND WHAT
IS MORE YOU ARE A FOOL IF YOU REFUSE TO TAKE ONE FROM ANY HAND THAT
OFFERS IT
VERY WELL MR
HUNSDEN NOW YOU HAVE SETTLED THAT POINT TALK OF
SOMETHING ELSE
WHAT NEWS FROM X
I HAVE NOT SETTLED THAT POINT OR AT LEAST THERE IS ANOTHER TO SETTLE
BEFORE WE GET TO X
IS THIS MISS ZENOBIE ZORAIDE INTERPOSED
I WELL ZORAIDE IS SHE REALLY MARRIED TO PELET
I TELL YOU YES AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME GO AND ASK THE CURE OF ST
JACQUES
AND YOUR HEART IS BROKEN
I AM NOT AWARE THAT IT IS IT FEELS ALL RIGHT BEATS AS USUAL
THEN YOUR FEELINGS ARE LESS SUPERFINE THAN I TOOK THEM TO BE YOU MUST
BE A COARSE CALLOUS CHARACTER TO BEAR SUCH A THWACK WITHOUT STAGGERING
UNDER IT
STAGGERING UNDER IT WHAT THE DEUCE IS THERE TO STAGGER UNDER IN THE
CIRCUMSTANCE OF A BELGIAN SCHOOLMISTRESS MARRYING A FRENCH SCHOOLMASTER
THE PROGENY WILL DOUBTLESS BE A STRANGE HYBRID RACE BUT THAT'S THEIR
LOOK OUT NOT MINE
HE INDULGES IN SCURRILOUS JESTS AND THE BRIDE WAS HIS AFFIANCED ONE
WHO SAID SO
BROWN
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HUNSDEN BROWN IS AN OLD GOSSIP
HE IS BUT IN THE MEANTIME IF HIS GOSSIP BE FOUNDED ON LESS THAN
FACT IF YOU TOOK NO PARTICULAR INTEREST IN MISS ZORAIDE WHY O
YOUTHFUL PEDAGOGUE DID YOU LEAVE YOUR PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER
BECOMING MADAME PELET
BECAUSE I FELT MY FACE GROW A LITTLE HOT BECAUSE IN SHORT MR
HUNSDEN I DECLINE ANSWERING ANY MORE QUESTIONS AND I PLUNGED MY HANDS
DEEP IN MY BREECHES POCKET
HUNSDEN TRIUMPHED HIS EYES HIS LAUGH ANNOUNCED VICTORY
WHAT THE DEUCE ARE YOU LAUGHING AT MR
HUNSDEN
AT YOUR EXEMPLARY COMPOSURE
WELL LAD I'LL NOT BORE YOU I SEE HOW
IT IS ZORAIDE HAS JILTED YOU MARRIED SOME ONE RICHER AS ANY SENSIBLE
WOMAN WOULD HAVE DONE IF SHE HAD HAD THE CHANCE
I MADE NO REPLY I LET HIM THINK SO NOT FEELING INCLINED TO ENTER INTO
AN EXPLANATION OF THE REAL STATE OF THINGS AND AS LITTLE TO FORGE A
FALSE ACCOUNT BUT IT WAS NOT EASY TO BLIND HUNSDEN MY VERY SILENCE
INSTEAD OF CONVINCING HIM THAT HE HAD HIT THE TRUTH SEEMED TO RENDER
HIM DOUBTFUL ABOUT IT HE WENT ON
I SUPPOSE THE AFFAIR HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AS SUCH AFFAIRS ALWAYS
ARE AMONGST RATIONAL PEOPLE YOU OFFERED HER YOUR YOUTH AND YOUR
TALENTS SUCH AS THEY ARE IN EXCHANGE FOR HER POSITION AND MONEY I
DON'T SUPPOSE YOU TOOK APPEARANCE OR WHAT IS CALLED LOVE INTO THE
ACCOUNT FOR I UNDERSTAND SHE IS OLDER THAN YOU AND BROWN SAYS RATHER
SENSIBLE LOOKING THAN BEAUTIFUL
SHE HAVING THEN NO CHANCE OF MAKING
A BETTER BARGAIN WAS AT FIRST INCLINED TO COME TO TERMS WITH YOU BUT
PELET THE HEAD OF A FLOURISHING SCHOOL STEPPED IN WITH A HIGHER BID
SHE ACCEPTED AND HE HAS GOT HER A CORRECT TRANSACTION PERFECTLY
SO BUSINESS LIKE AND LEGITIMATE
AND NOW WE'LL TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
DO SAID I VERY GLAD TO DISMISS THE TOPIC AND ESPECIALLY GLAD TO
HAVE BAFFLED THE SAGACITY OF MY CROSS QUESTIONER IF INDEED I HAD
BAFFLED IT FOR THOUGH HIS WORDS NOW LED AWAY FROM THE DANGEROUS POINT
HIS EYES KEEN AND WATCHFUL SEEMED STILL PREOCCUPIED WITH THE FORMER
IDEA
YOU WANT TO HEAR NEWS FROM X AND WHAT INTEREST CAN YOU HAVE IN
X YOU LEFT NO FRIENDS THERE FOR YOU MADE NONE
NOBODY EVER ASKS
AFTER YOU NEITHER MAN NOR WOMAN AND IF I MENTION YOUR NAME IN COMPANY
THE MEN LOOK AS IF I HAD SPOKEN OF PRESTER JOHN AND THE WOMEN SNEER
COVERTLY
OUR X BELLES MUST HAVE DISLIKED YOU
HOW DID YOU EXCITE
THEIR DISPLEASURE
I DON'T KNOW
I SELDOM SPOKE TO THEM THEY WERE NOTHING TO ME
I
CONSIDERED THEM ONLY AS SOMETHING TO BE GLANCED AT FROM A DISTANCE
THEIR DRESSES AND FACES WERE OFTEN PLEASING ENOUGH TO THE EYE BUT
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR CONVERSATION NOR EVEN READ THEIR
COUNTENANCES
WHEN I CAUGHT SNATCHES OF WHAT THEY SAID I COULD NEVER
MAKE MUCH OF IT AND THE PLAY OF THEIR LIPS AND EYES DID NOT HELP ME AT
ALL
THAT WAS YOUR FAULT NOT THEIRS
THERE ARE SENSIBLE AS WELL AS
HANDSOME WOMEN IN X WOMEN IT IS WORTH ANY MAN'S WHILE TO TALK TO
AND WITH WHOM I CAN TALK WITH PLEASURE BUT YOU HAD AND HAVE NO PLEASANT
ADDRESS THERE IS NOTHING IN YOU TO INDUCE A WOMAN TO BE AFFABLE
I HAVE
REMARKED YOU SITTING NEAR THE DOOR IN A ROOM FULL OF COMPANY BENT ON
HEARING NOT ON SPEAKING ON OBSERVING NOT ON ENTERTAINING LOOKING
FRIGIDLY SHY AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF A PARTY CONFUSINGLY VIGILANT ABOUT
THE MIDDLE AND INSULTINGLY WEARY TOWARDS THE END
IS THAT THE WAY DO
YOU THINK EVER TO COMMUNICATE PLEASURE OR EXCITE INTEREST NO AND IF
YOU ARE GENERALLY UNPOPULAR IT IS BECAUSE YOU DESERVE TO BE SO
CONTENT I EJACULATED
NO YOU ARE NOT CONTENT YOU SEE BEAUTY ALWAYS TURNING ITS BACK ON
YOU YOU ARE MORTIFIED AND THEN YOU SNEER
I VERILY BELIEVE ALL THAT IS
DESIRABLE ON EARTH WEALTH REPUTATION LOVE WILL FOR EVER TO YOU BE
THE RIPE GRAPES ON THE HIGH TRELLIS YOU'LL LOOK UP AT THEM THEY WILL
TANTALIZE IN YOU THE LUST OF THE EYE BUT THEY ARE OUT OF REACH YOU
HAVE NOT THE ADDRESS TO FETCH A LADDER AND YOU'LL GO AWAY CALLING THEM
SOUR
CUTTING AS THESE WORDS MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES THEY
DREW NO BLOOD NOW
MY LIFE WAS CHANGED MY EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN VARIED
SINCE I LEFT X BUT HUNSDEN COULD NOT KNOW THIS HE HAD SEEN ME ONLY
IN THE CHARACTER OF MR
CRIMSWORTH'S CLERK A DEPENDANT AMONGST WEALTHY
STRANGERS MEETING DISDAIN WITH A HARD FRONT CONSCIOUS OF AN UNSOCIAL
AND UNATTRACTIVE EXTERIOR REFUSING TO SUE FOR NOTICE WHICH I WAS SURE
WOULD BE WITHHELD DECLINING TO EVINCE AN ADMIRATION WHICH I KNEW WOULD
BE SCORNED AS WORTHLESS
HE COULD NOT BE AWARE THAT SINCE THEN YOUTH AND
LOVELINESS HAD BEEN TO ME EVERYDAY OBJECTS THAT I HAD STUDIED THEM AT
LEISURE AND CLOSELY AND HAD SEEN THE PLAIN TEXTURE OF TRUTH UNDER
THE EMBROIDERY OF APPEARANCE NOR COULD HE KEEN SIGHTED AS HE
WAS PENETRATE INTO MY HEART SEARCH MY BRAIN AND READ MY PECULIAR
SYMPATHIES AND ANTIPATHIES HE HAD NOT KNOWN ME LONG ENOUGH OR WELL
ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE HOW LOW MY FEELINGS WOULD EBB UNDER SOME INFLUENCES
POWERFUL OVER MOST MINDS HOW HIGH HOW FAST THEY WOULD FLOW UNDER
OTHER INFLUENCES THAT PERHAPS ACTED WITH THE MORE INTENSE FORCE ON ME
BECAUSE THEY ACTED ON ME ALONE
NEITHER COULD HE SUSPECT FOR AN INSTANT
THE HISTORY OF MY COMMUNICATIONS WITH MDLLE
REUTER SECRET TO HIM
AND TO ALL OTHERS WAS THE TALE OF HER STRANGE INFATUATION HER
BLANDISHMENTS HER WILES HAD BEEN SEEN BUT BY ME AND TO ME ONLY WERE
THEY KNOWN BUT THEY HAD CHANGED ME FOR THEY HAD PROVED THAT I COULD
IMPRESS
A SWEETER SECRET NESTLED DEEPER IN MY HEART ONE FULL OF
TENDERNESS AND AS FULL OF STRENGTH IT TOOK THE STING OUT OF HUNSDEN'S
SARCASM IT KEPT ME UNBENT BY SHAME AND UNSTIRRED BY WRATH
BUT OF ALL
THIS I COULD SAY NOTHING NOTHING DECISIVE AT LEAST UNCERTAINTY SEALED
MY LIPS AND DURING THE INTERVAL OF SILENCE BY WHICH ALONE I REPLIED TO
MR
HUNSDEN I MADE UP MY MIND TO BE FOR THE PRESENT WHOLLY MISJUDGED
BY HIM AND MISJUDGED I WAS HE THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN RATHER TOO HARD
UPON ME AND THAT I WAS CRUSHED BY THE WEIGHT OF HIS UPBRAIDINGS SO TO
RE ASSURE ME HE SAID DOUBTLESS I SHOULD MEND SOME DAY I WAS ONLY AT
THE BEGINNING OF LIFE YET AND SINCE HAPPILY I WAS NOT QUITE WITHOUT
SENSE EVERY FALSE STEP I MADE WOULD BE A GOOD LESSON
JUST THEN I TURNED MY FACE A LITTLE TO THE LIGHT THE APPROACH OF
TWILIGHT AND MY POSITION IN THE WINDOW SEAT HAD FOR THE LAST TEN
MINUTES PREVENTED HIM FROM STUDYING MY COUNTENANCE AS I MOVED
HOWEVER HE CAUGHT AN EXPRESSION WHICH HE THUS INTERPRETED
CONFOUND IT HOW DOGGEDLY SELF APPROVING THE LAD LOOKS I THOUGHT HE
WAS FIT TO DIE WITH SHAME AND THERE HE SITS GRINNING SMILES AS GOOD AS
TO SAY 'LET THE WORLD WAG AS IT WILL I'VE THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
IN MY WAIST COAT POCKET AND THE ELIXIR OF LIFE IN MY CUPBOARD I'M
INDEPENDENT OF BOTH FATE AND FORTUNE
HUNSDEN YOU SPOKE OF GRAPES I WAS THINKING OF A FRUIT I LIKE BETTER
THAN YOUR X HOT HOUSE GRAPES AN UNIQUE FRUIT GROWING WILD WHICH I
HAVE MARKED AS MY OWN AND HOPE ONE DAY TO GATHER AND TASTE
IT IS OF NO
USE YOUR OFFERING ME THE DRAUGHT OF BITTERNESS OR THREATENING ME WITH
DEATH BY THIRST I HAVE THE ANTICIPATION OF SWEETNESS ON MY PALATE THE
HOPE OF FRESHNESS ON MY LIPS I CAN REJECT THE UNSAVOURY AND ENDURE THE
EXHAUSTING
FOR HOW LONG
TILL THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY FOR EFFORT AND AS THE PRIZE OF SUCCESS WILL
BE A TREASURE AFTER MY OWN HEART I'LL BRING A BULL'S STRENGTH TO THE
STRUGGLE
BAD LUCK CRUSHES BULLS AS EASILY AS BULLACES AND I BELIEVE THE FURY
DOGS YOU YOU WERE BORN WITH A WOODEN SPOON IN YOUR MOUTH DEPEND ON
IT
I BELIEVE YOU AND I MEAN TO MAKE MY WOODEN SPOON DO THE WORK OF SOME
PEOPLE'S SILVER LADLES GRASPED FIRMLY AND HANDLED NIMBLY EVEN A
WOODEN SPOON WILL SHOVEL UP BROTH
HUNSDEN ROSE I SEE SAID HE I SUPPOSE YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE WHO
DEVELOP BEST UNWATCHED AND ACT BEST UNAIDED WORK YOUR OWN WAY
NOW
I'LL GO AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE WAS GOING AT THE DOOR HE
TURNED
CRIMSWORTH HALL IS SOLD SAID HE
SOLD WAS MY ECHO
YES YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT YOUR BROTHER FAILED THREE MONTHS AGO
WHAT EDWARD CRIMSWORTH
PRECISELY AND HIS WIFE WENT HOME TO HER FATHER'S WHEN AFFAIRS WENT
AWRY HIS TEMPER SYMPATHIZED WITH THEM HE USED HER ILL I TOLD YOU HE
WOULD BE A TYRANT TO HER SOME DAY AS TO HIM
AY AS TO HIM WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM
NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY DON'T BE ALARMED HE PUT HIMSELF UNDER THE
PROTECTION OF THE COURT COMPOUNDED WITH HIS CREDITORS TENPENCE IN
THE POUND IN SIX WEEKS SET UP AGAIN COAXED BACK HIS WIFE AND IS
FLOURISHING LIKE A GREEN BAY TREE
AND CRIMSWORTH HALL WAS THE FURNITURE SOLD TOO
EVERYTHING FROM THE GRAND PIANO DOWN TO THE ROLLING PIN
AND THE CONTENTS OF THE OAK DINING ROOM WERE THEY SOLD
OF COURSE WHY SHOULD THE SOFAS AND CHAIRS OF THAT ROOM BE HELD MORE
SACRED THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER
AND THE PICTURES
WHAT PICTURES CRIMSWORTH HAD NO SPECIAL COLLECTION THAT I KNOW OF HE
DID NOT PROFESS TO BE AN AMATEUR
THERE WERE TWO PORTRAITS ONE ON EACH SIDE THE MANTELPIECE YOU CANNOT
HAVE FORGOTTEN THEM MR
HUNSDEN YOU ONCE NOTICED THAT OF THE LADY
OH I KNOW THE THIN FACED GENTLEWOMAN WITH A SHAWL PUT ON LIKE
DRAPERY WHY AS A MATTER OF COURSE IT WOULD BE SOLD AMONG THE OTHER
THINGS
IF YOU HAD BEEN RICH YOU MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT IT FOR I REMEMBER
YOU SAID IT REPRESENTED YOUR MOTHER YOU SEE WHAT IT IS TO BE WITHOUT A
SOU
I DID
BUT SURELY I THOUGHT TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT ALWAYS BE SO
POVERTY STRICKEN I MAY ONE DAY BUY IT BACK YET WHO PURCHASED IT DO
YOU KNOW I ASKED
HOW IS IT LIKELY I NEVER INQUIRED WHO PURCHASED ANYTHING THERE SPOKE
THE UNPRACTICAL MAN TO IMAGINE ALL THE WORLD IS INTERESTED IN WHAT
INTERESTS HIMSELF NOW GOOD NIGHT I'M OFF FOR GERMANY TO MORROW
MORNING I SHALL BE BACK HERE IN SIX WEEKS AND POSSIBLY I MAY CALL
AND SEE YOU AGAIN I WONDER WHETHER YOU'LL BE STILL OUT OF PLACE
HE LAUGHED AS MOCKINGLY AS HEARTLESSLY AS MEPHISTOPHELES AND SO
LAUGHING VANISHED
SOME PEOPLE HOWEVER INDIFFERENT THEY MAY BECOME AFTER A CONSIDERABLE
SPACE OF ABSENCE ALWAYS CONTRIVE TO LEAVE A PLEASANT IMPRESSION JUST
AT PARTING NOT SO HUNSDEN A CONFERENCE WITH HIM AFFECTED ONE LIKE A
DRAUGHT OF PERUVIAN BARK IT SEEMED A CONCENTRATION OF THE SPECIALLY
HARSH STRINGENT BITTER WHETHER LIKE BARK IT INVIGORATED I SCARCELY
KNEW
A RUFFLED MIND MAKES A RESTLESS PILLOW I SLEPT LITTLE ON THE NIGHT
AFTER THIS INTERVIEW TOWARDS MORNING I BEGAN TO DOZE BUT HARDLY HAD MY
SLUMBER BECOME SLEEP WHEN I WAS ROUSED FROM IT BY HEARING A NOISE IN
MY SITTING ROOM TO WHICH MY BED ROOM ADJOINED A STEP AND A SHOVING OF
FURNITURE THE MOVEMENT LASTED BARELY TWO MINUTES WITH THE CLOSING
OF THE DOOR IT CEASED
I LISTENED NOT A MOUSE STIRRED PERHAPS I
HAD DREAMT IT PERHAPS A LOCATAIRE HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND ENTERED MY
APARTMENT INSTEAD OF HIS OWN
IT WAS YET BUT FIVE O'CLOCK NEITHER I NOR
THE DAY WERE WIDE AWAKE I TURNED AND WAS SOON UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN I DID
RISE ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER I HAD FORGOTTEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE THE FIRST
THING I SAW HOWEVER ON QUITTING MY CHAMBER RECALLED IT JUST PUSHED
IN AT THE DOOR OF MY SITTING ROOM AND STILL STANDING ON END WAS A
WOODEN PACKING CASE A ROUGH DEAL AFFAIR WIDE BUT SHALLOW A PORTER
HAD DOUBTLESS SHOVED IT FORWARD BUT SEEING NO OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM HAD
LEFT IT AT THE ENTRANCE
THAT IS NONE OF MINE THOUGHT I APPROACHING IT MUST BE MEANT FOR
SOMEBODY ELSE I STOOPED TO EXAMINE THE ADDRESS
WM
CRIMSWORTH ESQ NO ST BRUSSELS
I WAS PUZZLED BUT CONCLUDING THAT THE BEST WAY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION
WAS TO ASK WITHIN I CUT THE CORDS AND OPENED THE CASE
GREEN BAIZE
ENVELOPED ITS CONTENTS SEWN CAREFULLY AT THE SIDES I RIPPED THE
PACK THREAD WITH MY PEN KNIFE AND STILL AS THE SEAM GAVE WAY GLIMPSES
OF GILDING APPEARED THROUGH THE WIDENING INTERSTICES
BOARDS AND BAIZE
BEING AT LENGTH REMOVED I LIFTED FROM THE CASE A LARGE PICTURE IN A
MAGNIFICENT FRAME LEANING IT AGAINST A CHAIR IN A POSITION WHERE THE
LIGHT FROM THE WINDOW FELL FAVOURABLY UPON IT I STEPPED BACK ALREADY I
HAD MOUNTED MY SPECTACLES
A PORTRAIT PAINTER'S SKY THE MOST SOMBRE AND
THREATENING OF WELKINS AND DISTANT TREES OF A CONVENTIONAL DEPTH OF
HUE RAISED IN FULL RELIEF A PALE PENSIVE LOOKING FEMALE FACE SHADOWED
WITH SOFT DARK HAIR ALMOST BLENDING WITH THE EQUALLY DARK CLOUDS
LARGE SOLEMN EYES LOOKED REFLECTIVELY INTO MINE A THIN CHEEK RESTED
ON A DELICATE LITTLE HAND A SHAWL ARTISTICALLY DRAPED HALF HID HALF
SHOWED A SLIGHT FIGURE
A LISTENER HAD THERE BEEN ONE MIGHT HAVE HEARD
ME AFTER TEN MINUTES' SILENT GAZING UTTER THE WORD MOTHER I MIGHT
HAVE SAID MORE BUT WITH ME THE FIRST WORD UTTERED ALOUD IN SOLILOQUY
ROUSES CONSCIOUSNESS IT REMINDS ME THAT ONLY CRAZY PEOPLE TALK TO
THEMSELVES AND THEN I THINK OUT MY MONOLOGUE INSTEAD OF SPEAKING IT
I HAD THOUGHT A LONG WHILE AND A LONG WHILE HAD CONTEMPLATED THE
INTELLIGENCE THE SWEETNESS AND ALAS THE SADNESS ALSO OF THOSE FINE
GREY EYES THE MENTAL POWER OF THAT FOREHEAD AND THE RARE SENSIBILITY
OF THAT SERIOUS MOUTH WHEN MY GLANCE TRAVELLING DOWNWARDS FELL ON A
NARROW BILLET STUCK IN THE CORNER OF THE PICTURE BETWEEN THE FRAME AND
THE CANVAS
THEN I FIRST ASKED WHO SENT THIS PICTURE WHO THOUGHT OF
ME SAVED IT OUT OF THE WRECK OF CRIMSWORTH HALL AND NOW COMMITS IT TO
THE CARE OF ITS NATURAL KEEPER I TOOK THE NOTE FROM ITS NICHE THUS IT
SPOKE
THERE IS A SORT OF STUPID PLEASURE IN GIVING A CHILD SWEETS A FOOL HIS
BELLS A DOG A BONE
YOU ARE REPAID BY SEEING THE CHILD BESMEAR HIS FACE
WITH SUGAR BY WITNESSING HOW THE FOOL'S ECSTASY MAKES A GREATER FOOL OF
HIM THAN EVER BY WATCHING THE DOG'S NATURE COME OUT OVER HIS BONE
IN GIVING WILLIAM CRIMSWORTH HIS MOTHER'S PICTURE I GIVE HIM SWEETS
BELLS AND BONE ALL IN ONE WHAT GRIEVES ME IS THAT I CANNOT BEHOLD
THE RESULT I WOULD HAVE ADDED FIVE SHILLINGS MORE TO MY BID IF THE
AUCTIONEER COULD ONLY HAVE PROMISED ME THAT PLEASURE
H
Y
H
P S YOU SAID LAST NIGHT YOU POSITIVELY DECLINED ADDING ANOTHER ITEM
TO YOUR ACCOUNT WITH ME DON'T YOU THINK I'VE SAVED YOU THAT TROUBLE
I MUFFLED THE PICTURE IN ITS GREEN BAIZE COVERING RESTORED IT TO THE
CASE AND HAVING TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CONCERN TO MY BED ROOM PUT IT
OUT OF SIGHT UNDER MY BED
MY PLEASURE WAS NOW POISONED BY PUNGENT PAIN
I DETERMINED TO LOOK NO MORE TILL I COULD LOOK AT MY EASE
IF HUNSDEN
HAD COME IN AT THAT MOMENT I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO HIM I OWE YOU
NOTHING HUNSDEN NOT A FRACTION OF A FARTHING YOU HAVE PAID YOURSELF
IN TAUNTS
TOO ANXIOUS TO REMAIN ANY LONGER QUIESCENT I HAD NO SOONER BREAKFASTED
THAN I REPAIRED ONCE MORE TO M
VANDENHUTEN'S SCARCELY HOPING TO FIND
HIM AT HOME FOR A WEEK HAD BARELY ELAPSED SINCE MY FIRST CALL BUT
FANCYING I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GLEAN INFORMATION AS TO THE TIME WHEN HIS
RETURN WAS EXPECTED
A BETTER RESULT AWAITED ME THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED
FOR THOUGH THE FAMILY WERE YET AT OSTEND M
VANDENHUTEN HAD COME OVER
TO BRUSSELS ON BUSINESS FOR THE DAY
HE RECEIVED ME WITH THE QUIET
KINDNESS OF A SINCERE THOUGH NOT EXCITABLE MAN
I HAD NOT SAT FIVE
MINUTES ALONE WITH HIM IN HIS BUREAU BEFORE I BECAME AWARE OF A SENSE
OF EASE IN HIS PRESENCE SUCH AS I RARELY EXPERIENCED WITH STRANGERS
I WAS SURPRISED AT MY OWN COMPOSURE FOR AFTER ALL I HAD COME ON
BUSINESS TO ME EXCEEDINGLY PAINFUL THAT OF SOLICITING A FAVOUR
I ASKED
ON WHAT BASIS THE CALM RESTED I FEARED IT MIGHT BE DECEPTIVE
ERE LONG
I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE GROUND AND AT ONCE I FELT ASSURED OF ITS
SOLIDITY I KNEW WHERE IT WAS
M
VANDENHUTEN WAS RICH RESPECTED AND INFLUENTIAL I POOR DESPISED
AND POWERLESS SO WE STOOD TO THE WORLD AT LARGE AS MEMBERS OF THE
WORLD'S SOCIETY BUT TO EACH OTHER AS A PAIR OF HUMAN BEINGS OUR
POSITIONS WERE REVERSED
THE DUTCHMAN HE WAS NOT FLAMAND BUT PURE
HOLLANDAIS WAS SLOW COOL OF RATHER DENSE INTELLIGENCE THOUGH SOUND
AND ACCURATE JUDGMENT THE ENGLISHMAN FAR MORE NERVOUS ACTIVE QUICKER
BOTH TO PLAN AND TO PRACTISE TO CONCEIVE AND TO REALIZE
THE DUTCHMAN
WAS BENEVOLENT THE ENGLISHMAN SUSCEPTIBLE IN SHORT OUR CHARACTERS
DOVETAILED BUT MY MIND HAVING MORE FIRE AND ACTION THAN HIS
INSTINCTIVELY ASSUMED AND KEPT THE PREDOMINANCE
THIS POINT SETTLED AND MY POSITION WELL ASCERTAINED I ADDRESSED HIM
ON THE SUBJECT OF MY AFFAIRS WITH THAT GENUINE FRANKNESS WHICH FULL
CONFIDENCE CAN ALONE INSPIRE
IT WAS A PLEASURE TO HIM TO BE SO APPEALED
TO HE THANKED ME FOR GIVING HIM THIS OPPORTUNITY OF USING A LITTLE
EXERTION IN MY BEHALF
I WENT ON TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT MY WISH WAS NOT
SO MUCH TO BE HELPED AS TO BE PUT INTO THE WAY OF HELPING MYSELF
OF HIM I DID NOT WANT EXERTION THAT WAS TO BE MY PART BUT ONLY
INFORMATION AND RECOMMENDATION
SOON AFTER I ROSE TO GO
HE HELD OUT HIS
HAND AT PARTING AN ACTION OF GREATER SIGNIFICANCE WITH FOREIGNERS
THAN WITH ENGLISHMEN
AS I EXCHANGED A SMILE WITH HIM I THOUGHT THE
BENEVOLENCE OF HIS TRUTHFUL FACE WAS BETTER THAN THE INTELLIGENCE OF MY
OWN
CHARACTERS OF MY ORDER EXPERIENCE A BALM LIKE SOLACE IN THE CONTACT
OF SUCH SOULS AS ANIMATED THE HONEST BREAST OF VICTOR VANDENHUTEN
THE NEXT FORTNIGHT WAS A PERIOD OF MANY ALTERNATIONS MY EXISTENCE
DURING ITS LAPSE RESEMBLED A SKY OF ONE OF THOSE AUTUMNAL NIGHTS WHICH
ARE SPECIALLY HAUNTED BY METEORS AND FALLING STARS
HOPES AND FEARS
EXPECTATIONS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS DESCENDED IN GLANCING SHOWERS FROM
ZENITH TO HORIZON BUT ALL WERE TRANSIENT AND DARKNESS FOLLOWED SWIFT
EACH VANISHING APPARITION
M
VANDENHUTEN AIDED ME FAITHFULLY HE SET ME
ON THE TRACK OF SEVERAL PLACES AND HIMSELF MADE EFFORTS TO SECURE
THEM FOR ME BUT FOR A LONG TIME SOLICITATION AND RECOMMENDATION WERE
VAIN THE DOOR EITHER SHUT IN MY FACE WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO WALK IN
OR ANOTHER CANDIDATE ENTERING BEFORE ME RENDERED MY FURTHER ADVANCE
USELESS
FEVERISH AND ROUSED NO DISAPPOINTMENT ARRESTED ME DEFEAT
FOLLOWING FAST ON DEFEAT SERVED AS STIMULANTS TO WILL
I FORGOT
FASTIDIOUSNESS CONQUERED RESERVE THRUST PRIDE FROM ME I ASKED I
PERSEVERED I REMONSTRATED I DUNNED
IT IS SO THAT OPENINGS ARE FORCED
INTO THE GUARDED CIRCLE WHERE FORTUNE SITS DEALING FAVOURS ROUND
MY
PERSEVERANCE MADE ME KNOWN MY IMPORTUNITY MADE ME REMARKED
I WAS
INQUIRED ABOUT MY FORMER PUPILS' PARENTS GATHERING THE REPORTS OF
THEIR CHILDREN HEARD ME SPOKEN OF AS TALENTED AND THEY ECHOED THE
WORD THE SOUND BANDIED ABOUT AT RANDOM CAME AT LAST TO EARS WHICH
BUT FOR ITS UNIVERSALITY IT MIGHT NEVER HAVE REACHED AND AT THE VERY
CRISIS WHEN I HAD TRIED MY LAST EFFORT AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO FORTUNE
LOOKED IN AT ME ONE MORNING AS I SAT IN DREAR AND ALMOST DESPERATE
DELIBERATION ON MY BEDSTEAD NODDED WITH THE FAMILIARITY OF AN OLD
ACQUAINTANCE THOUGH GOD KNOWS I HAD NEVER MET HER BEFORE AND THREW A
PRIZE INTO MY LAP
IN THE SECOND WEEK OF OCTOBER 18 I GOT THE APPOINTMENT OF ENGLISH
PROFESSOR TO ALL THE CLASSES OF COLLEGE BRUSSELS WITH A SALARY
OF THREE THOUSAND FRANCS PER ANNUM AND THE CERTAINTY OF BEING ABLE BY
DINT OF THE REPUTATION AND PUBLICITY ACCOMPANYING THE POSITION TO MAKE
AS MUCH MORE BY PRIVATE MEANS
THE OFFICIAL NOTICE WHICH COMMUNICATED
THIS INFORMATION MENTIONED ALSO THAT IT WAS THE STRONG RECOMMENDATION
OF M
VANDENHUTEN NEGOCIANT WHICH HAD TURNED THE SCALE OF CHOICE IN MY
FAVOUR
NO SOONER HAD I READ THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAN I HURRIED TO M
VANDENHUTEN'S
BUREAU PUSHED THE DOCUMENT UNDER HIS NOSE AND WHEN HE HAD PERUSED
IT TOOK BOTH HIS HANDS AND THANKED HIM WITH UNRESTRAINED VIVACITY
MY VIVID WORDS AND EMPHATIC GESTURE MOVED HIS DUTCH CALM TO UNWONTED
SENSATION
HE SAID HE WAS HAPPY GLAD TO HAVE SERVED ME BUT HE HAD
DONE NOTHING MERITING SUCH THANKS
HE HAD NOT LAID OUT A CENTIME ONLY
SCRATCHED A FEW WORDS ON A SHEET OF PAPER
AGAIN I REPEATED TO HIM
YOU HAVE MADE ME QUITE HAPPY AND IN A WAY THAT SUITS ME I DO NOT
FEEL AN OBLIGATION IRKSOME CONFERRED BY YOUR KIND HAND I DO NOT FEEL
DISPOSED TO SHUN YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE ME A FAVOUR FROM THIS DAY
YOU MUST CONSENT TO ADMIT ME TO YOUR INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE FOR I SHALL
HEREAFTER RECUR AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE PLEASURE OF YOUR SOCIETY
AINSI SOIT IL WAS THE REPLY ACCOMPANIED BY A SMILE OF BENIGNANT
CONTENT
I WENT AWAY WITH ITS SUNSHINE IN MY HEART
CHAPTER XXIII
IT WAS TWO O'CLOCK WHEN I RETURNED TO MY LODGINGS MY DINNER JUST
BROUGHT IN FROM A NEIGHBOURING HOTEL SMOKED ON THE TABLE I SAT DOWN
THINKING TO EAT HAD THE PLATE BEEN HEAPED WITH POTSHERDS AND BROKEN
GLASS INSTEAD OF BOILED BEEF AND HARICOTS I COULD NOT HAVE MADE A MORE
SIGNAL FAILURE APPETITE HAD FORSAKEN ME
IMPATIENT OF SEEING FOOD
WHICH I COULD NOT TASTE I PUT IT ALL ASIDE INTO A CUPBOARD AND THEN
DEMANDED WHAT SHALL I DO TILL EVENING FOR BEFORE SIX P M
IT WOULD
BE VAIN TO SEEK THE RUE NOTRE DAME AUX NEIGES ITS INHABITANT FOR ME
IT HAD BUT ONE WAS DETAINED BY HER VOCATION ELSEWHERE
I WALKED IN THE
STREETS OF BRUSSELS AND I WALKED IN MY OWN ROOM FROM TWO O'CLOCK
TILL SIX NEVER ONCE IN THAT SPACE OF TIME DID I SIT DOWN
I WAS IN MY
CHAMBER WHEN THE LAST NAMED HOUR STRUCK I HAD JUST BATHED MY FACE AND
FEVERISH HANDS AND WAS STANDING NEAR THE GLASS MY CHEEK WAS CRIMSON
MY EYE WAS FLAME STILL ALL MY FEATURES LOOKED QUITE SETTLED AND
CALM
DESCENDING SWIFTLY THE STAIR AND STEPPING OUT I WAS GLAD TO SEE
TWILIGHT DRAWING ON IN CLOUDS SUCH SHADE WAS TO ME LIKE A GRATEFUL
SCREEN AND THE CHILL OF LATTER AUTUMN BREATHING IN A FITFUL WIND FROM
THE NORTH WEST MET ME AS A REFRESHING COOLNESS
STILL I SAW IT WAS COLD
TO OTHERS FOR THE WOMEN I PASSED WERE WRAPPED IN SHAWLS AND THE MEN
HAD THEIR COATS BUTTONED CLOSE
WHEN ARE WE QUITE HAPPY WAS I SO THEN NO AN URGENT AND GROWING DREAD
WORRIED MY NERVES AND HAD WORRIED THEM SINCE THE FIRST MOMENT GOOD
TIDINGS HAD REACHED ME
HOW WAS FRANCES IT WAS TEN WEEKS SINCE I HAD
SEEN HER SIX SINCE I HAD HEARD FROM HER OR OF HER
I HAD ANSWERED
HER LETTER BY A BRIEF NOTE FRIENDLY BUT CALM IN WHICH NO MENTION OF
CONTINUED CORRESPONDENCE OR FURTHER VISITS WAS MADE
AT THAT HOUR MY
BARK HUNG ON THE TOPMOST CURL OF A WAVE OF FATE AND I KNEW NOT ON WHAT
SHOAL THE ONWARD RUSH OF THE BILLOW MIGHT HURL IT I WOULD NOT THEN
ATTACH HER DESTINY TO MINE BY THE SLIGHTEST THREAD IF DOOMED TO SPLIT
ON THE ROCK OR RUN AGROUND ON THE SAND BANK I WAS RESOLVED NO OTHER
VESSEL SHOULD SHARE MY DISASTER BUT SIX WEEKS WAS A LONG TIME AND
COULD IT BE THAT SHE WAS STILL WELL AND DOING WELL WERE NOT ALL SAGES
AGREED IN DECLARING THAT HAPPINESS FINDS NO CLIMAX ON EARTH DARED
I THINK THAT BUT HALF A STREET NOW DIVIDED ME FROM THE FULL CUP OF
CONTENTMENT THE DRAUGHT DRAWN FROM WATERS SAID TO FLOW ONLY IN HEAVEN
I WAS AT THE DOOR I ENTERED THE QUIET HOUSE I MOUNTED THE STAIRS THE
LOBBY WAS VOID AND STILL ALL THE DOORS CLOSED I LOOKED FOR THE NEAT
GREEN MAT IT LAY DULY IN ITS PLACE
SIGNAL OF HOPE I SAID AND ADVANCED
BUT I WILL BE A LITTLE CALMER
I AM NOT GOING TO RUSH IN AND GET UP A SCENE DIRECTLY FORCIBLY
STAYING MY EAGER STEP I PAUSED ON THE MAT
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE HUSH IS SHE IN IS ANYBODY IN I DEMANDED TO
MYSELF
A LITTLE TINKLE AS OF CINDERS FALLING FROM A GRATE REPLIED
A MOVEMENT A FIRE WAS GENTLY STIRRED AND THE SLIGHT RUSTLE OF LIFE
CONTINUING A STEP PACED EQUABLY BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BACKWARDS AND
FORWARDS IN THE APARTMENT
FASCINATED I STOOD MORE FIXEDLY FASCINATED
WHEN A VOICE REWARDED THE ATTENTION OF MY STRAINED EAR SO LOW SO
SELF ADDRESSED I NEVER FANCIED THE SPEAKER OTHERWISE THAN ALONE
SOLITUDE MIGHT SPEAK THUS IN A DESERT OR IN THE HALL OF A FORSAKEN
HOUSE
'AND NE'ER BUT ONCE MY SON HE SAID
'WAS YON DARK CAVERN TROD
IN PERSECUTION'S IRON DAYS
WHEN THE LAND WAS LEFT BY GOD
FROM BEWLEY'S BOG WITH SLAUGHTER RED
A WANDERER HITHER DREW
AND OFT HE STOPP'D AND TURN'D HIS HEAD
AS BY FITS THE NIGHT WINDS BLEW
FOR TRAMPLING ROUND BY CHEVIOT EDGE
WERE HEARD THE TROOPERS KEEN
AND FREQUENT FROM THE WHITELAW RIDGE
THE DEATH SHOT FLASH'D BETWEEN ETC
ETC
THE OLD SCOTCH BALLAD WAS PARTLY RECITED THEN DROPT A PAUSE ENSUED
THEN ANOTHER STRAIN FOLLOWED IN FRENCH OF WHICH THE PURPORT
TRANSLATED RAN AS FOLLOWS
I GAVE AT FIRST ATTENTION CLOSE
THEN INTEREST WARM ENSUED
FROM INTEREST AS IMPROVEMENT ROSE
SUCCEEDED GRATITUDE
OBEDIENCE WAS NO EFFORT SOON
AND LABOUR WAS NO PAIN
IF TIRED A WORD A GLANCE ALONE
WOULD GIVE ME STRENGTH AGAIN
FROM OTHERS OF THE STUDIOUS BAND
ERE LONG HE SINGLED ME
BUT ONLY BY MORE CLOSE DEMAND
AND STERNER URGENCY
THE TASK HE FROM ANOTHER TOOK
FROM ME HE DID REJECT
HE WOULD NO SLIGHT OMISSION BROOK
AND SUFFER NO DEFECT
IF MY COMPANIONS WENT ASTRAY
HE SCARCE THEIR WANDERINGS BLAM'D
IF I BUT FALTER'D IN THE WAY
HIS ANGER FIERCELY FLAM'D
SOMETHING STIRRED IN AN ADJOINING CHAMBER IT WOULD NOT DO TO BE
SURPRISED EAVES DROPPING I TAPPED HASTILY AND AS HASTILY ENTERED
FRANCES WAS JUST BEFORE ME SHE HAD BEEN WALKING SLOWLY IN HER ROOM
AND HER STEP WAS CHECKED BY MY ADVENT TWILIGHT ONLY WAS WITH HER AND
TRANQUIL RUDDY FIRELIGHT TO THESE SISTERS THE BRIGHT AND THE DARK
SHE HAD BEEN SPEAKING ERE I ENTERED IN POETRY
SIR WALTER SCOTT'S
VOICE TO HER A FOREIGN FAR OFF SOUND A MOUNTAIN ECHO HAD UTTERED
ITSELF IN THE FIRST STANZAS THE SECOND I THOUGHT FROM THE STYLE AND
THE SUBSTANCE WAS THE LANGUAGE OF HER OWN HEART
HER FACE WAS GRAVE
ITS EXPRESSION CONCENTRATED SHE BENT ON ME AN UNSMILING EYE AN EYE
JUST RETURNING FROM ABSTRACTION JUST AWAKING FROM DREAMS WELL ARRANGED
WAS HER SIMPLE ATTIRE SMOOTH HER DARK HAIR ORDERLY HER TRANQUIL ROOM
BUT WHAT WITH HER THOUGHTFUL LOOK HER SERIOUS SELF RELIANCE HER
BENT TO MEDITATION AND HAPLY INSPIRATION WHAT HAD SHE TO DO WITH LOVE
NOTHING WAS THE ANSWER OF HER OWN SAD THOUGH GENTLE COUNTENANCE IT
SEEMED TO SAY I MUST CULTIVATE FORTITUDE AND CLING TO POETRY ONE IS
TO BE MY SUPPORT AND THE OTHER MY SOLACE THROUGH LIFE
HUMAN AFFECTIONS
DO NOT BLOOM NOR DO HUMAN PASSIONS GLOW FOR ME OTHER WOMEN HAVE SUCH
THOUGHTS
FRANCES HAD SHE BEEN AS DESOLATE AS SHE DEEMED WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN WORSE OFF THAN THOUSANDS OF HER SEX
LOOK AT THE RIGID AND
FORMAL RACE OF OLD MAIDS THE RACE WHOM ALL DESPISE THEY HAVE FED
THEMSELVES FROM YOUTH UPWARDS ON MAXIMS OF RESIGNATION AND ENDURANCE
MANY OF THEM GET OSSIFIED WITH THE DRY DIET SELF CONTROL IS SO
CONTINUALLY THEIR THOUGHT SO PERPETUALLY THEIR OBJECT THAT AT LAST
IT ABSORBS THE SOFTER AND MORE AGREEABLE QUALITIES OF THEIR NATURE AND
THEY DIE MERE MODELS OF AUSTERITY FASHIONED OUT OF A LITTLE PARCHMENT
AND MUCH BONE
ANATOMISTS WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A HEART IN THE
WITHERED OLD MAID'S CARCASS THE SAME AS IN THAT OF ANY CHERISHED WIFE
OR PROUD MOTHER IN THE LAND
CAN THIS BE SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW BUT
FEEL INCLINED TO DOUBT IT
I CAME FORWARD BADE FRANCES GOOD EVENING AND TOOK MY SEAT
THE CHAIR
I HAD CHOSEN WAS ONE SHE HAD PROBABLY JUST LEFT IT STOOD BY A LITTLE
TABLE WHERE WERE HER OPEN DESK AND PAPERS
I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE HAD
FULLY RECOGNIZED ME AT FIRST BUT SHE DID SO NOW AND IN A VOICE SOFT
BUT QUIET SHE RETURNED MY GREETING
I HAD SHOWN NO EAGERNESS SHE TOOK
HER CUE FROM ME AND EVINCED NO SURPRISE
WE MET AS WE HAD ALWAYS MET
AS MASTER AND PUPIL NOTHING MORE
I PROCEEDED TO HANDLE THE PAPERS
FRANCES OBSERVANT AND SERVICEABLE STEPPED INTO AN INNER ROOM BROUGHT
A CANDLE LIT IT PLACED IT BY ME THEN DREW THE CURTAIN OVER THE
LATTICE AND HAVING ADDED A LITTLE FRESH FUEL TO THE ALREADY BRIGHT
FIRE SHE DREW A SECOND CHAIR TO THE TABLE AND SAT DOWN AT MY RIGHT
HAND A LITTLE REMOVED
THE PAPER ON THE TOP WAS A TRANSLATION OF
SOME GRAVE FRENCH AUTHOR INTO ENGLISH BUT UNDERNEATH LAY A SHEET WITH
STANZAS ON THIS I LAID HANDS
FRANCES HALF ROSE MADE A MOVEMENT TO
RECOVER THE CAPTURED SPOIL SAYING THAT WAS NOTHING A MERE COPY OF
VERSES
I PUT BY RESISTANCE WITH THE DECISION I KNEW SHE NEVER LONG
OPPOSED BUT ON THIS OCCASION HER FINGERS HAD FASTENED ON THE PAPER
I
HAD QUIETLY TO UNLOOSE THEM THEIR HOLD DISSOLVED TO MY TOUCH HER HAND
SHRUNK AWAY MY OWN WOULD FAIN HAVE FOLLOWED IT BUT FOR THE PRESENT I
FORBADE SUCH IMPULSE
THE FIRST PAGE OF THE SHEET WAS OCCUPIED WITH
THE LINES I HAD OVERHEARD THE SEQUEL WAS NOT EXACTLY THE WRITER'S OWN
EXPERIENCE BUT A COMPOSITION BY PORTIONS OF THAT EXPERIENCE SUGGESTED
THUS WHILE EGOTISM WAS AVOIDED THE FANCY WAS EXERCISED AND THE HEART
SATISFIED
I TRANSLATE AS BEFORE AND MY TRANSLATION IS NEARLY LITERAL
IT CONTINUED THUS
WHEN SICKNESS STAY'D AWHILE MY COURSE
HE SEEM'D IMPATIENT STILL
BECAUSE HIS PUPIL'S FLAGGING FORCE
COULD NOT OBEY HIS WILL
ONE DAY WHEN SUMMONED TO THE BED
WHERE PAIN AND I DID STRIVE
I HEARD HIM AS HE BENT HIS HEAD
SAY GOD SHE MUST REVIVE
I FELT HIS HAND WITH GENTLE STRESS
A MOMENT LAID ON MINE
AND WISHED TO MARK MY CONSCIOUSNESS
BY SOME RESPONSIVE SIGN
BUT POW'RLESS THEN TO SPEAK OR MOVE
I ONLY FELT WITHIN
THE SENSE OF HOPE THE STRENGTH OF LOVE
THEIR HEALING WORK BEGIN
AND AS HE FROM THE ROOM WITHDREW
MY HEART HIS STEPS PURSUED
I LONG'D TO PROVE BY EFFORTS NEW
MY SPEECHLESS GRATITUDE
WHEN ONCE AGAIN I TOOK MY PLACE
LONG VACANT IN THE CLASS
TH' UNFREQUENT SMILE ACROSS HIS FACE
DID FOR ONE MOMENT PASS
THE LESSONS DONE THE SIGNAL MADE
OF GLAD RELEASE AND PLAY
HE AS HE PASSED AN INSTANT STAY'D
ONE KINDLY WORD TO SAY
JANE TILL TO MORROW YOU ARE FREE
FROM TEDIOUS TASK AND RULE
THIS AFTERNOON I MUST NOT SEE
THAT YET PALE FACE IN SCHOOL
SEEK IN THE GARDEN SHADES A SEAT
FAR FROM THE PLAY GROUND DIN
THE SUN IS WARM THE AIR IS SWEET
STAY TILL I CALL YOU IN
A LONG AND PLEASANT AFTERNOON
I PASSED IN THOSE GREEN BOWERS
ALL SILENT TRANQUIL AND ALONE
WITH BIRDS AND BEES AND FLOWERS
YET WHEN MY MASTER'S VOICE I HEARD
CALL FROM THE WINDOW JANE
I ENTERED JOYFUL AT THE WORD
THE BUSY HOUSE AGAIN
HE IN THE HALL PACED UP AND DOWN
HE PAUSED AS I PASSED BY
HIS FOREHEAD STERN RELAXED ITS FROWN
HE RAISED HIS DEEP SET EYE
NOT QUITE SO PALE HE MURMURED LOW
NOW JANE GO REST AWHILE
AND AS I SMILED HIS SMOOTHENED BROW
RETURNED AS GLAD A SMILE
MY PERFECT HEALTH RESTORED HE TOOK
HIS MIEN AUSTERE AGAIN
AND AS BEFORE HE WOULD NOT BROOK
THE SLIGHTEST FAULT FROM JANE
THE LONGEST TASK THE HARDEST THEME
FELL TO MY SHARE AS ERST
AND STILL I TOILED TO PLACE MY NAME
IN EVERY STUDY FIRST
HE YET BEGRUDGED AND STINTED PRAISE
BUT I HAD LEARNT TO READ
THE SECRET MEANING OF HIS FACE
AND THAT WAS MY BEST MEED
EVEN WHEN HIS HASTY TEMPER SPOKE
IN TONES THAT SORROW STIRRED
MY GRIEF WAS LULLED AS SOON AS WOKE
BY SOME RELENTING WORD
AND WHEN HE LENT SOME PRECIOUS BOOK
OR GAVE SOME FRAGRANT FLOWER
I DID NOT QUAIL TO ENVY'S LOOK
UPHELD BY PLEASURE'S POWER
AT LAST OUR SCHOOL RANKS TOOK THEIR GROUND
THE HARD FOUGHT FIELD I WON
THE PRIZE A LAUREL WREATH WAS BOUND
MY THROBBING FOREHEAD ON
LOW AT MY MASTER'S KNEE I BENT
THE OFFERED CROWN TO MEET
ITS GREEN LEAVES THROUGH MY TEMPLES SENT
A THRILL AS WILD AS SWEET
THE STRONG PULSE OF AMBITION STRUCK
IN EVERY VEIN I OWNED
AT THE SAME INSTANT BLEEDING BROKE
A SECRET INWARD WOUND
THE HOUR OF TRIUMPH WAS TO ME
THE HOUR OF SORROW SORE
A DAY HENCE I MUST CROSS THE SEA
NE'ER TO RECROSS IT MORE
AN HOUR HENCE IN MY MASTER'S ROOM
I WITH HIM SAT ALONE
AND TOLD HIM WHAT A DREARY GLOOM
O'ER JOY HAD PARTING THROWN
HE LITTLE SAID THE TIME WAS BRIEF
THE SHIP WAS SOON TO SAIL
AND WHILE I SOBBED IN BITTER GRIEF
MY MASTER BUT LOOKED PALE
THEY CALLED IN HASTE HE BADE ME GO
THEN SNATCHED ME BACK AGAIN
HE HELD ME FAST AND MURMURED LOW
WHY WILL THEY PART US JANE
WERE YOU NOT HAPPY IN MY CARE
DID I NOT FAITHFUL PROVE
WILL OTHERS TO MY DARLING BEAR
AS TRUE AS DEEP A LOVE
O GOD WATCH O'ER MY FOSTER CHILD
O GUARD HER GENTLE HEAD
WHEN MINDS ARE HIGH AND TEMPESTS WILD
PROTECTION ROUND HER SPREAD
THEY CALL AGAIN LEAVE THEN MY BREAST
QUIT THY TRUE SHELTER JANE
BUT WHEN DECEIVED REPULSED OPPREST
COME HOME TO ME AGAIN
I READ THEN DREAMILY MADE MARKS ON THE MARGIN WITH MY PENCIL THINKING
ALL THE WHILE OF OTHER THINGS THINKING THAT JANE WAS NOW AT MY SIDE
NO CHILD BUT A GIRL OF NINETEEN AND SHE MIGHT BE MINE SO MY HEART
AFFIRMED POVERTY'S CURSE WAS TAKEN OFF ME ENVY AND JEALOUSY WERE
FAR AWAY AND UNAPPRIZED OF THIS OUR QUIET MEETING THE FROST OF THE
MASTER'S MANNER MIGHT MELT I FELT THE THAW COMING FAST WHETHER I WOULD
OR NOT NO FURTHER NEED FOR THE EYE TO PRACTISE A HARD LOOK FOR THE
BROW TO COMPRESS ITS EXPANSE INTO A STERN FOLD IT WAS NOW PERMITTED
TO SUFFER THE OUTWARD REVELATION OF THE INWARD GLOW TO SEEK DEMAND
ELICIT AN ANSWERING ARDOUR
WHILE MUSING THUS I THOUGHT THAT THE GRASS
ON HERMON NEVER DRANK THE FRESH DEWS OF SUNSET MORE GRATEFULLY THAN MY
FEELINGS DRANK THE BLISS OF THIS HOUR
FRANCES ROSE AS IF RESTLESS SHE PASSED BEFORE ME TO STIR THE FIRE
WHICH DID NOT WANT STIRRING SHE LIFTED AND PUT DOWN THE LITTLE
ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE HER DRESS WAVED WITHIN A YARD OF ME
SLIGHT STRAIGHT AND ELEGANT SHE STOOD ERECT ON THE HEARTH
THERE ARE IMPULSES WE CAN CONTROL BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH CONTROL
US BECAUSE THEY ATTAIN US WITH A TIGER LEAP AND ARE OUR MASTERS ERE
WE HAVE SEEN THEM
PERHAPS THOUGH SUCH IMPULSES ARE SELDOM ALTOGETHER
BAD PERHAPS REASON BY A PROCESS AS BRIEF AS QUIET A PROCESS THAT
IS FINISHED ERE FELT HAS ASCERTAINED THE SANITY OF THE DEED INSTINCT
MEDITATES AND FEELS JUSTIFIED IN REMAINING PASSIVE WHILE IT IS
PERFORMED
I KNOW I DID NOT REASON I DID NOT PLAN OR INTEND YET
WHEREAS ONE MOMENT I WAS SITTING SOLUS ON THE CHAIR NEAR THE TABLE
THE NEXT I HELD FRANCES ON MY KNEE PLACED THERE WITH SHARPNESS AND
DECISION AND RETAINED WITH EXCEEDING TENACITY
MONSIEUR CRIED FRANCES AND WAS STILL NOT ANOTHER WORD ESCAPED HER
LIPS SORELY CONFOUNDED SHE SEEMED DURING THE LAPSE OF THE FIRST FEW
MOMENTS BUT THE AMAZEMENT SOON SUBSIDED TERROR DID NOT SUCCEED NOR
FURY AFTER ALL SHE WAS ONLY A LITTLE NEARER THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN
BEFORE TO ONE SHE HABITUALLY RESPECTED AND TRUSTED EMBARRASSMENT MIGHT
HAVE IMPELLED HER TO CONTEND BUT SELF RESPECT CHECKED RESISTANCE WHERE
RESISTANCE WAS USELESS
FRANCES HOW MUCH REGARD HAVE YOU FOR ME WAS MY DEMAND
NO ANSWER
THE SITUATION WAS YET TOO NEW AND SURPRISING TO PERMIT SPEECH
ON THIS
CONSIDERATION I COMPELLED MYSELF FOR SOME SECONDS TO TOLERATE HER
SILENCE THOUGH IMPATIENT OF IT PRESENTLY I REPEATED THE SAME
QUESTION PROBABLY NOT IN THE CALMEST OF TONES SHE LOOKED AT ME MY
FACE DOUBTLESS WAS NO MODEL OF COMPOSURE MY EYES NO STILL WELLS OF
TRANQUILLITY
DO SPEAK I URGED AND A VERY LOW HURRIED YET STILL ARCH VOICE
SAID
MONSIEUR VOUS ME FAITES MAL DE GRACE LACHEZ UN PEU MA MAIN DROITE
IN TRUTH I BECAME AWARE THAT I WAS HOLDING THE SAID MAIN DROITE IN
A SOMEWHAT RUTHLESS GRASP I DID AS DESIRED AND FOR THE THIRD TIME
ASKED MORE GENTLY
FRANCES HOW MUCH REGARD HAVE YOU FOR ME
MON MAITRE J'EN AI BEAUCOUP WAS THE TRUTHFUL REJOINDER
FRANCES HAVE YOU ENOUGH TO GIVE YOURSELF TO ME AS MY WIFE TO ACCEPT
ME AS YOUR HUSBAND
I FELT THE AGITATION OF THE HEART I SAW THE PURPLE LIGHT OF LOVE CAST
ITS GLOWING REFLECTION ON CHEEKS TEMPLES NECK I DESIRED TO CONSULT
THE EYE BUT SHELTERING LASH AND LID FORBADE
MONSIEUR SAID THE SOFT VOICE AT LAST MONSIEUR DESIRE SAVOIR SI JE
CONSENS SI ENFIN SI JE VEUX ME MARIER AVEC LUI
JUSTEMENT
MONSIEUR SERA T IL AUSSI BON MARI QU'IL A ETE BON MAITRE
I WILL TRY FRANCES
A PAUSE THEN WITH A NEW YET STILL SUBDUED INFLEXION OF THE VOICE AN
INFLEXION WHICH PROVOKED WHILE IT PLEASED ME ACCOMPANIED TOO BY A
SOURIRE A LA FOIS FIN ET TIMIDE IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH THE TONE
C'EST A DIRE MONSIEUR SERA TOUJOURS UN PEU ENTETE EXIGEANT
VOLONTAIRE
HAVE I BEEN SO FRANCES
MAIS OUI VOUS LE SAVEZ BIEN
HAVE I BEEN NOTHING ELSE
MAIS OUI VOUS AVEZ ETE MON MEILLEUR AMI
AND WHAT FRANCES ARE YOU TO ME
VOTRE DEVOUEE ELEVE QUI VOUS AIME DE TOUT SON COEUR
WILL MY PUPIL CONSENT TO PASS HER LIFE WITH ME SPEAK ENGLISH NOW
FRANCES
SOME MOMENTS WERE TAKEN FOR REFLECTION THE ANSWER PRONOUNCED SLOWLY
RAN THUS
YOU HAVE ALWAYS MADE ME HAPPY I LIKE TO HEAR YOU SPEAK I LIKE TO
SEE YOU I LIKE TO BE NEAR YOU I BELIEVE YOU ARE VERY GOOD AND VERY
SUPERIOR I KNOW YOU ARE STERN TO THOSE WHO ARE CARELESS AND IDLE BUT
YOU ARE KIND VERY KIND TO THE ATTENTIVE AND INDUSTRIOUS EVEN IF THEY
ARE NOT CLEVER
MASTER I SHOULD BE GLAD TO LIVE WITH YOU ALWAYS
AND SHE MADE A SORT OF MOVEMENT AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE CLUNG TO ME BUT
RESTRAINING HERSELF SHE ONLY ADDED WITH EARNEST EMPHASIS MASTER I
CONSENT TO PASS MY LIFE WITH YOU
VERY WELL FRANCES
I DREW HER A LITTLE NEARER TO MY HEART I TOOK A FIRST KISS FROM HER
LIPS THEREBY SEALING THE COMPACT NOW FRAMED BETWEEN US AFTERWARDS SHE
AND I WERE SILENT NOR WAS OUR SILENCE BRIEF
FRANCES' THOUGHTS DURING
THIS INTERVAL I KNOW NOT NOR DID I ATTEMPT TO GUESS THEM I WAS NOT
OCCUPIED IN SEARCHING HER COUNTENANCE NOR IN OTHERWISE TROUBLING HER
COMPOSURE
THE PEACE I FELT I WISHED HER TO FEEL MY ARM IT IS TRUE
STILL DETAINED HER BUT WITH A RESTRAINT THAT WAS GENTLE ENOUGH SO LONG
AS NO OPPOSITION TIGHTENED IT
MY GAZE WAS ON THE RED FIRE MY HEART WAS
MEASURING ITS OWN CONTENT IT SOUNDED AND SOUNDED AND FOUND THE DEPTH
FATHOMLESS
MONSIEUR AT LAST SAID MY QUIET COMPANION AS STIRLESS IN HER
HAPPINESS AS A MOUSE IN ITS TERROR
EVEN NOW IN SPEAKING SHE SCARCELY
LIFTED HER HEAD
WELL FRANCES I LIKE UNEXAGGERATED INTERCOURSE IT IS NOT MY WAY TO
OVERPOWER WITH AMOROUS EPITHETS ANY MORE THAN TO WORRY WITH SELFISHLY
IMPORTUNATE CARESSES
MONSIEUR EST RAISONNABLE N'EST CE PAS
YES ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM REQUESTED TO BE SO IN ENGLISH BUT WHY DO
YOU ASK ME YOU SEE NOTHING VEHEMENT OR OBTRUSIVE IN MY MANNER AM I NOT
TRANQUIL ENOUGH
CE N'EST PAS CELA BEGAN FRANCES
ENGLISH I REMINDED HER
WELL MONSIEUR I WISHED MERELY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD LIKE OF COURSE
TO RETAIN MY EMPLOYMENT OF TEACHING
YOU WILL TEACH STILL I SUPPOSE
MONSIEUR
OH YES IT IS ALL I HAVE TO DEPEND ON
BON I MEAN GOOD
THUS WE SHALL HAVE BOTH THE SAME PROFESSION
I LIKE
THAT AND MY EFFORTS TO GET ON WILL BE AS UNRESTRAINED AS YOURS WILL
THEY NOT MONSIEUR
YOU ARE LAYING PLANS TO BE INDEPENDENT OF ME SAID I
YES MONSIEUR I MUST BE NO INCUMBRANCE TO YOU NO BURDEN IN ANY WAY
BUT FRANCES I HAVE NOT YET TOLD YOU WHAT MY PROSPECTS ARE
I HAVE
LEFT M
PELET'S AND AFTER NEARLY A MONTH'S SEEKING I HAVE GOT ANOTHER
PLACE WITH A SALARY OF THREE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR WHICH I CAN EASILY
DOUBLE BY A LITTLE ADDITIONAL EXERTION
THUS YOU SEE IT WOULD BE USELESS
FOR YOU TO FAG YOURSELF BY GOING OUT TO GIVE LESSONS ON SIX THOUSAND
FRANCS YOU AND I CAN LIVE AND LIVE WELL
FRANCES SEEMED TO CONSIDER
THERE IS SOMETHING FLATTERING TO MAN'S
STRENGTH SOMETHING CONSONANT TO HIS HONOURABLE PRIDE IN THE IDEA OF
BECOMING THE PROVIDENCE OF WHAT HE LOVES FEEDING AND CLOTHING IT AS
GOD DOES THE LILIES OF THE FIELD
SO TO DECIDE HER RESOLUTION I WENT
ON
LIFE HAS BEEN PAINFUL AND LABORIOUS ENOUGH TO YOU SO FAR FRANCES YOU
REQUIRE COMPLETE REST YOUR TWELVE HUNDRED FRANCS WOULD NOT FORM A VERY
IMPORTANT ADDITION TO OUR INCOME AND WHAT SACRIFICE OF COMFORT TO EARN
IT RELINQUISH YOUR LABOURS YOU MUST BE WEARY AND LET ME HAVE THE
HAPPINESS OF GIVING YOU REST
I AM NOT SURE WHETHER FRANCES HAD ACCORDED DUE ATTENTION TO MY HARANGUE
INSTEAD OF ANSWERING ME WITH HER USUAL RESPECTFUL PROMPTITUDE SHE ONLY
SIGHED AND SAID
HOW RICH YOU ARE MONSIEUR AND THEN SHE STIRRED UNEASY IN MY
ARMS
THREE THOUSAND FRANCS SHE MURMURED WHILE I GET ONLY TWELVE
HUNDRED SHE WENT ON FASTER
HOWEVER IT MUST BE SO FOR THE PRESENT
AND MONSIEUR WERE YOU NOT SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT MY GIVING UP MY
PLACE OH NO I SHALL HOLD IT FAST AND HER LITTLE FINGERS EMPHATICALLY
TIGHTENED ON MINE
THINK OF MY MARRYING YOU TO BE KEPT BY YOU MONSIEUR I COULD NOT DO
IT AND HOW DULL MY DAYS WOULD BE YOU WOULD BE AWAY TEACHING IN CLOSE
NOISY SCHOOL ROOMS FROM MORNING TILL EVENING AND I SHOULD BE LINGERING
AT HOME UNEMPLOYED AND SOLITARY I SHOULD GET DEPRESSED AND SULLEN AND
YOU WOULD SOON TIRE OF ME
FRANCES YOU COULD READ AND STUDY TWO THINGS YOU LIKE SO WELL
MONSIEUR I COULD NOT I LIKE A CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE BUT I LIKE AN
ACTIVE LIFE BETTER I MUST ACT IN SOME WAY AND ACT WITH YOU
I HAVE
TAKEN NOTICE MONSIEUR THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
FOR AMUSEMENT NEVER REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER SO WELL OR ESTEEM EACH
OTHER SO HIGHLY AS THOSE WHO WORK TOGETHER AND PERHAPS SUFFER
TOGETHER
YOU SPEAK GOD'S TRUTH SAID I AT LAST AND YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR OWN
WAY FOR IT IS THE BEST WAY
NOW AS A REWARD FOR SUCH READY CONSENT
GIVE ME A VOLUNTARY KISS
AFTER SOME HESITATION NATURAL TO A NOVICE IN THE ART OF KISSING SHE
BROUGHT HER LIPS INTO VERY SHY AND GENTLE CONTACT WITH MY FOREHEAD I
TOOK THE SMALL GIFT AS A LOAN AND REPAID IT PROMPTLY AND WITH GENEROUS
INTEREST
I KNOW NOT WHETHER FRANCES WAS REALLY MUCH ALTERED SINCE THE TIME
I FIRST SAW HER BUT AS I LOOKED AT HER NOW I FELT THAT SHE WAS
SINGULARLY CHANGED FOR ME THE SAD EYE THE PALE CHEEK THE DEJECTED
AND JOYLESS COUNTENANCE I REMEMBERED AS HER EARLY ATTRIBUTES WERE QUITE
GONE AND NOW I SAW A FACE DRESSED IN GRACES SMILE DIMPLE AND
ROSY TINT ROUNDED ITS CONTOURS AND BRIGHTENED ITS HUES
I HAD BEEN
ACCUSTOMED TO NURSE A FLATTERING IDEA THAT MY STRONG ATTACHMENT TO HER
PROVED SOME PARTICULAR PERSPICACITY IN MY NATURE SHE WAS NOT HANDSOME
SHE WAS NOT RICH SHE WAS NOT EVEN ACCOMPLISHED YET WAS SHE MY LIFE'S
TREASURE I MUST THEN BE A MAN OF PECULIAR DISCERNMENT
TO NIGHT MY EYES
OPENED ON THE MISTAKE I HAD MADE I BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT IT WAS ONLY MY
TASTES WHICH WERE UNIQUE NOT MY POWER OF DISCOVERING AND APPRECIATING
THE SUPERIORITY OF MORAL WORTH OVER PHYSICAL CHARMS
FOR ME FRANCES
HAD PHYSICAL CHARMS IN HER THERE WAS NO DEFORMITY TO GET OVER NONE OF
THOSE PROMINENT DEFECTS OF EYES TEETH COMPLEXION SHAPE WHICH HOLD AT
BAY THE ADMIRATION OF THE BOLDEST MALE CHAMPIONS OF INTELLECT FOR
WOMEN CAN LOVE A DOWNRIGHT UGLY MAN IF HE BE BUT TALENTED HAD SHE BEEN
EITHER EDENTEE MYOPE RUGUEUSE OU BOSSUE MY FEELINGS TOWARDS
HER MIGHT STILL HAVE BEEN KINDLY BUT THEY COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
IMPASSIONED I HAD AFFECTION FOR THE POOR LITTLE MISSHAPEN SYLVIE BUT
FOR HER I COULD NEVER HAVE HAD LOVE
IT IS TRUE FRANCES' MENTAL POINTS
HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO INTEREST ME AND THEY STILL RETAINED THE STRONGEST
HOLD ON MY PREFERENCE BUT I LIKED THE GRACES OF HER PERSON TOO
I
DERIVED A PLEASURE PURELY MATERIAL FROM CONTEMPLATING THE CLEARNESS
OF HER BROWN EYES THE FAIRNESS OF HER FINE SKIN THE PURITY OF HER
WELL SET TEETH THE PROPORTION OF HER DELICATE FORM AND THAT PLEASURE
I COULD ILL HAVE DISPENSED WITH
IT APPEARED THEN THAT I TOO WAS A
SENSUALIST IN MY TEMPERATE AND FASTIDIOUS WAY
NOW READER DURING THE LAST TWO PAGES I HAVE BEEN GIVING YOU HONEY
FRESH FROM FLOWERS BUT YOU MUST NOT LIVE ENTIRELY ON FOOD SO LUSCIOUS
TASTE THEN A LITTLE GALL JUST A DROP BY WAY OF CHANGE
AT A SOMEWHAT LATE HOUR I RETURNED TO MY LODGINGS HAVING TEMPORARILY
FORGOTTEN THAT MAN HAD ANY SUCH COARSE CARES AS THOSE OF EATING AND
DRINKING I WENT TO BED FASTING
I HAD BEEN EXCITED AND IN ACTION ALL
DAY AND HAD TASTED NO FOOD SINCE EIGHT THAT MORNING BESIDES FOR A
FORTNIGHT PAST I HAD KNOWN NO REST EITHER OF BODY OR MIND THE LAST FEW
HOURS HAD BEEN A SWEET DELIRIUM IT WOULD NOT SUBSIDE NOW AND TILL LONG
AFTER MIDNIGHT BROKE WITH TROUBLED ECSTACY THE REST I SO MUCH NEEDED
AT LAST I DOZED BUT NOT FOR LONG IT WAS YET QUITE DARK WHEN I AWOKE
AND MY WAKING WAS LIKE THAT OF JOB WHEN A SPIRIT PASSED BEFORE HIS FACE
AND LIKE HIM THE HAIR OF MY FLESH STOOD UP I MIGHT CONTINUE THE
PARALLEL FOR IN TRUTH THOUGH I SAW NOTHING YET A THING WAS SECRETLY
BROUGHT UNTO ME AND MINE EAR RECEIVED A LITTLE THEREOF THERE WAS
SILENCE AND I HEARD A VOICE SAYING IN THE MIDST OF LIFE WE ARE IN
DEATH
THAT SOUND AND THE SENSATION OF CHILL ANGUISH ACCOMPANYING IT MANY
WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS SUPERNATURAL BUT I RECOGNIZED IT AT ONCE AS THE
EFFECT OF REACTION
MAN IS EVER CLOGGED WITH HIS MORTALITY AND IT WAS
MY MORTAL NATURE WHICH NOW FALTERED AND PLAINED MY NERVES WHICH JARRED
AND GAVE A FALSE SOUND BECAUSE THE SOUL OF LATE RUSHING HEADLONG TO AN
AIM HAD OVERSTRAINED THE BODY'S COMPARATIVE WEAKNESS
A HORROR OF GREAT
DARKNESS FELL UPON ME I FELT MY CHAMBER INVADED BY ONE I HAD KNOWN
FORMERLY BUT HAD THOUGHT FOR EVER DEPARTED
I WAS TEMPORARILY A PREY TO
HYPOCHONDRIA
SHE HAD BEEN MY ACQUAINTANCE NAY MY GUEST ONCE BEFORE IN BOYHOOD I
HAD ENTERTAINED HER AT BED AND BOARD FOR A YEAR FOR THAT SPACE OF TIME
I HAD HER TO MYSELF IN SECRET SHE LAY WITH ME SHE ATE WITH ME SHE
WALKED OUT WITH ME SHOWING ME NOOKS IN WOODS HOLLOWS IN HILLS WHERE
WE COULD SIT TOGETHER AND WHERE SHE COULD DROP HER DREAR VEIL OVER ME
AND SO HIDE SKY AND SUN GRASS AND GREEN TREE TAKING ME ENTIRELY TO HER
DEATH COLD BOSOM AND HOLDING ME WITH ARMS OF BONE
WHAT TALES SHE WOULD
TELL ME AT SUCH HOURS WHAT SONGS SHE WOULD RECITE IN MY EARS HOW SHE
WOULD DISCOURSE TO ME OF HER OWN COUNTRY THE GRAVE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
PROMISE TO CONDUCT ME THERE ERE LONG AND DRAWING ME TO THE VERY BRINK
OF A BLACK SULLEN RIVER SHOW ME ON THE OTHER SIDE SHORES UNEQUAL
WITH MOUND MONUMENT AND TABLET STANDING UP IN A GLIMMER MORE HOARY
THAN MOONLIGHT
NECROPOLIS SHE WOULD WHISPER POINTING TO THE PALE
PILES AND ADD IT CONTAINS A MANSION PREPARED FOR YOU
BUT MY BOYHOOD WAS LONELY PARENTLESS UNCHEERED BY BROTHER OR SISTER
AND THERE WAS NO MARVEL THAT JUST AS I ROSE TO YOUTH A SORCERESS
FINDING ME LOST IN VAGUE MENTAL WANDERINGS WITH MANY AFFECTIONS AND FEW
OBJECTS GLOWING ASPIRATIONS AND GLOOMY PROSPECTS STRONG DESIRES AND
SLENDER HOPES SHOULD LIFT UP HER ILLUSIVE LAMP TO ME IN THE DISTANCE
AND LURE ME TO HER VAULTED HOME OF HORRORS
NO WONDER HER SPELLS
THEN HAD POWER BUT NOW WHEN MY COURSE WAS WIDENING MY PROSPECT
BRIGHTENING WHEN MY AFFECTIONS HAD FOUND A REST WHEN MY DESIRES
FOLDING WINGS WEARY WITH LONG FLIGHT HAD JUST ALIGHTED ON THE VERY LAP
OF FRUITION AND NESTLED THERE WARM CONTENT UNDER THE CARESS OF A SOFT
HAND WHY DID HYPOCHONDRIA ACCOST ME NOW
I REPULSED HER AS ONE WOULD A DREADED AND GHASTLY CONCUBINE COMING TO
EMBITTER A HUSBAND'S HEART TOWARD HIS YOUNG BRIDE IN VAIN SHE KEPT HER
SWAY OVER ME FOR THAT NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY AND EIGHT SUCCEEDING DAYS
AFTERWARDS MY SPIRITS BEGAN SLOWLY TO RECOVER THEIR TONE MY APPETITE
RETURNED AND IN A FORTNIGHT I WAS WELL
I HAD GONE ABOUT AS USUAL ALL
THE TIME AND HAD SAID NOTHING TO ANYBODY OF WHAT I FELT BUT I WAS GLAD
WHEN THE EVIL SPIRIT DEPARTED FROM ME AND I COULD AGAIN SEEK FRANCES
AND SIT AT HER SIDE FREED FROM THE DREADFUL TYRANNY OF MY DEMON
CHAPTER XXIV
ONE FINE FROSTY SUNDAY IN NOVEMBER FRANCES AND I TOOK A LONG WALK WE
MADE THE TOUR OF THE CITY BY THE BOULEVARDS AND AFTERWARDS FRANCES
BEING A LITTLE TIRED WE SAT DOWN ON ONE OF THOSE WAYSIDE SEATS PLACED
UNDER THE TREES AT INTERVALS FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE WEARY
FRANCES WAS TELLING ME ABOUT SWITZERLAND THE SUBJECT ANIMATED HER
AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT HER EYES SPOKE FULL AS ELOQUENTLY AS HER
TONGUE WHEN SHE STOPPED AND REMARKED
MONSIEUR THERE IS A GENTLEMAN WHO KNOWS YOU
I LOOKED UP THREE FASHIONABLY DRESSED MEN WERE JUST THEN
PASSING ENGLISHMEN I KNEW BY THEIR AIR AND GAIT AS WELL AS BY THEIR
FEATURES IN THE TALLEST OF THE TRIO I AT ONCE RECOGNIZED MR
HUNSDEN
HE WAS IN THE ACT OF LIFTING HIS HAT TO FRANCES AFTERWARDS HE MADE A
GRIMACE AT ME AND PASSED ON
WHO IS HE
A PERSON I KNEW IN ENGLAND
WHY DID HE BOW TO ME HE DOES NOT KNOW ME
YES HE DOES KNOW YOU IN HIS WAY
HOW MONSIEUR SHE STILL CALLED ME MONSIEUR I COULD NOT PERSUADE
HER TO ADOPT ANY MORE FAMILIAR TERM
DID YOU NOT READ THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYES
OF HIS EYES NO
WHAT DID THEY SAY
TO YOU THEY SAID 'HOW DO YOU DO WILHELMINA CRIMSWORTH TO ME 'SO
YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR COUNTERPART AT LAST THERE SHE SITS THE FEMALE OF
YOUR KIND
MONSIEUR YOU COULD NOT READ ALL THAT IN HIS EYES HE WAS SO SOON
GONE
I READ THAT AND MORE FRANCES I READ THAT HE WILL PROBABLY CALL ON ME
THIS EVENING OR ON SOME FUTURE OCCASION SHORTLY AND I HAVE NO DOUBT
HE WILL INSIST ON BEING INTRODUCED TO YOU SHALL I BRING HIM TO YOUR
ROOMS
IF YOU PLEASE MONSIEUR I HAVE NO OBJECTION I THINK INDEED I SHOULD
RATHER LIKE TO SEE HIM NEARER HE LOOKS SO ORIGINAL
AS I HAD ANTICIPATED MR
HUNSDEN CAME THAT EVENING
THE FIRST THING HE
SAID WAS
YOU NEED NOT BEGIN BOASTING MONSIEUR LE PROFESSEUR I KNOW ABOUT YOUR
APPOINTMENT TO COLLEGE AND ALL THAT BROWN HAS TOLD ME THEN
HE INTIMATED THAT HE HAD RETURNED FROM GERMANY BUT A DAY OR TWO SINCE
AFTERWARDS HE ABRUPTLY DEMANDED WHETHER THAT WAS MADAME PELET REUTER
WITH WHOM HE HAD SEEN ME ON THE BOULEVARDS
I WAS GOING TO UTTER A
RATHER EMPHATIC NEGATIVE BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS I CHECKED MYSELF AND
SEEMING TO ASSENT ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF HER
AS TO HER I'LL COME TO THAT DIRECTLY BUT FIRST I'VE A WORD FOR YOU
I
SEE YOU ARE A SCOUNDREL YOU'VE NO BUSINESS TO BE PROMENADING ABOUT WITH
ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE
I THOUGHT YOU HAD SOUNDER SENSE THAN TO GET MIXED UP
IN FOREIGN HODGE PODGE OF THIS SORT
BUT THE LADY
SHE'S TOO GOOD FOR YOU EVIDENTLY SHE IS LIKE YOU BUT SOMETHING BETTER
THAN YOU NO BEAUTY THOUGH YET WHEN SHE ROSE FOR I LOOKED BACK TO
SEE YOU BOTH WALK AWAY I THOUGHT HER FIGURE AND CARRIAGE GOOD
THESE
FOREIGNERS UNDERSTAND GRACE
WHAT THE DEVIL HAS SHE DONE WITH PELET SHE
HAS NOT BEEN MARRIED TO HIM THREE MONTHS HE MUST BE A SPOON
I WOULD NOT LET THE MISTAKE GO TOO FAR I DID NOT LIKE IT MUCH
PELET HOW YOUR HEAD RUNS ON MONS
AND MADAME PELET YOU ARE ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT THEM
I WISH TO THE GODS YOU HAD WED MDLLE
ZORAIDE
YOURSELF
WAS THAT YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN NOT MDLLE
ZORAIDE
NO NOR MADAME ZORAIDE EITHER
WHY DID YOU TELL A LIE THEN
I TOLD NO LIE BUT YOU ARE IS SUCH A HURRY
SHE IS A PUPIL OF MINE A
SWISS GIRL
AND OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED TO HER DON'T DENY THAT
MARRIED I THINK I SHALL IF FATE SPARES US BOTH TEN WEEKS LONGER
THAT
IS MY LITTLE WILD STRAWBERRY HUNSDEN WHOSE SWEETNESS MADE ME CARELESS
OF YOUR HOTHOUSE GRAPES
STOP NO BOASTING NO HEROICS I WON'T HEAR THEM
WHAT IS SHE TO WHAT
CASTE DOES SHE BELONG
I SMILED
HUNSDEN UNCONSCIOUSLY LAID STRESS ON THE WORD CASTE AND IN
FACT REPUBLICAN LORD HATER AS HE WAS HUNSDEN WAS AS PROUD OF HIS OLD
SHIRE BLOOD OF HIS DESCENT AND FAMILY STANDING RESPECTABLE AND
RESPECTED THROUGH LONG GENERATIONS BACK AS ANY PEER IN THE REALM OF
HIS NORMAN RACE AND CONQUEST DATED TITLE
HUNSDEN WOULD AS LITTLE HAVE
THOUGHT OF TAKING A WIFE FROM A CASTE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN AS A STANLEY
WOULD THINK OF MATING WITH A COBDEN
I ENJOYED THE SURPRISE I SHOULD
GIVE I ENJOYED THE TRIUMPH OF MY PRACTICE OVER HIS THEORY AND LEANING
OVER THE TABLE AND UTTERING THE WORDS SLOWLY BUT WITH REPRESSED GLEE I
SAID CONCISELY
SHE IS A LACE MENDER
HUNSDEN EXAMINED ME
HE DID NOT SAY HE WAS SURPRISED BUT SURPRISED HE
WAS HE HAD HIS OWN NOTIONS OF GOOD BREEDING
I SAW HE SUSPECTED I
WAS GOING TO TAKE SOME VERY RASH STEP BUT REPRESSING DECLAMATION OR
REMONSTRANCE HE ONLY ANSWERED
WELL YOU ARE THE BEST JUDGE OF YOUR OWN AFFAIRS
A LACE MENDER MAY
MAKE A GOOD WIFE AS WELL AS A LADY BUT OF COURSE YOU HAVE TAKEN CARE
TO ASCERTAIN THOROUGHLY THAT SINCE SHE HAS NOT EDUCATION FORTUNE OR
STATION SHE IS WELL FURNISHED WITH SUCH NATURAL QUALITIES AS YOU THINK
MOST LIKELY TO CONDUCE TO YOUR HAPPINESS
HAS SHE MANY RELATIONS
NONE IN BRUSSELS
THAT IS BETTER
RELATIONS ARE OFTEN THE REAL EVIL IN SUCH CASES
I
CANNOT BUT THINK THAT A TRAIN OF INFERIOR CONNECTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN A
BORE TO YOU TO YOUR LIFE'S END
AFTER SITTING IN SILENCE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER HUNSDEN ROSE AND WAS
QUIETLY BIDDING ME GOOD EVENING THE POLITE CONSIDERATE MANNER IN WHICH
HE OFFERED ME HIS HAND A THING HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE CONVINCED ME
THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MADE A TERRIBLE FOOL OF MYSELF AND THAT RUINED
AND THROWN AWAY AS I WAS IT WAS NO TIME FOR SARCASM OR CYNICISM OR
INDEED FOR ANYTHING BUT INDULGENCE AND FORBEARANCE
GOOD NIGHT WILLIAM HE SAID IN A REALLY SOFT VOICE WHILE HIS FACE
LOOKED BENEVOLENTLY COMPASSIONATE
GOOD NIGHT LAD
I WISH YOU AND YOUR
FUTURE WIFE MUCH PROSPERITY AND I HOPE SHE WILL SATISFY YOUR FASTIDIOUS
SOUL
I HAD MUCH ADO TO REFRAIN FROM LAUGHING AS I BEHELD THE MAGNANIMOUS PITY
OF HIS MIEN MAINTAINING HOWEVER A GRAVE AIR I SAID
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN MDLLE
HENRI
OH THAT IS THE NAME YES IF IT WOULD BE CONVENIENT I SHOULD LIKE TO
SEE HER BUT HE HESITATED
WELL
I SHOULD ON NO ACCOUNT WISH TO INTRUDE
COME THEN SAID I
WE SET OUT
HUNSDEN NO DOUBT REGARDED ME AS A
RASH IMPRUDENT MAN THUS TO SHOW MY POOR LITTLE GRISETTE SWEETHEART
IN HER POOR LITTLE UNFURNISHED GRENIER BUT HE PREPARED TO ACT THE REAL
GENTLEMAN HAVING IN FACT THE KERNEL OF THAT CHARACTER UNDER THE
HARSH HUSK IT PLEASED HIM TO WEAR BY WAY OF MENTAL MACKINTOSH
HE TALKED
AFFABLY AND EVEN GENTLY AS WE WENT ALONG THE STREET HE HAD NEVER BEEN
SO CIVIL TO ME IN HIS LIFE
WE REACHED THE HOUSE ENTERED ASCENDED THE
STAIR ON GAINING THE LOBBY HUNSDEN TURNED TO MOUNT A NARROWER STAIR
WHICH LED TO A HIGHER STORY I SAW HIS MIND WAS BENT ON THE ATTICS
HERE MR
HUNSDEN SAID I QUIETLY TAPPING AT FRANCES' DOOR
HE
TURNED IN HIS GENUINE POLITENESS HE WAS A LITTLE DISCONCERTED AT
HAVING MADE THE MISTAKE HIS EYE REVERTED TO THE GREEN MAT BUT HE SAID
NOTHING
WE WALKED IN AND FRANCES ROSE FROM HER SEAT NEAR THE TABLE TO RECEIVE
US HER MOURNING ATTIRE GAVE HER A RECLUSE RATHER CONVENTUAL BUT
WITHAL VERY DISTINGUISHED LOOK ITS GRAVE SIMPLICITY ADDED NOTHING
TO BEAUTY BUT MUCH TO DIGNITY THE FINISH OF THE WHITE COLLAR AND
MANCHETTES SUFFICED FOR A RELIEF TO THE MERINO GOWN OF SOLEMN BLACK
ORNAMENT WAS FORSWORN
FRANCES CURTSIED WITH SEDATE GRACE LOOKING AS
SHE ALWAYS DID WHEN ONE FIRST ACCOSTED HER MORE A WOMAN TO RESPECT
THAN TO LOVE I INTRODUCED MR
HUNSDEN AND SHE EXPRESSED HER HAPPINESS
AT MAKING HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN FRENCH
THE PURE AND POLISHED ACCENT THE
LOW YET SWEET AND RATHER FULL VOICE PRODUCED THEIR EFFECT IMMEDIATELY
HUNSDEN SPOKE FRENCH IN REPLY I HAD NOT HEARD HIM SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE
BEFORE HE MANAGED IT VERY WELL
I RETIRED TO THE WINDOW SEAT MR
HUNSDEN AT HIS HOSTESS'S INVITATION OCCUPIED A CHAIR NEAR THE HEARTH
FROM MY POSITION I COULD SEE THEM BOTH AND THE ROOM TOO AT A GLANCE
THE ROOM WAS SO CLEAN AND BRIGHT IT LOOKED LIKE A LITTLE POLISHED
CABINET A GLASS FILLED WITH FLOWERS IN THE CENTRE OF THE TABLE A
FRESH ROSE IN EACH CHINA CUP ON THE MANTELPIECE GAVE IT AN AIR OF FETE
FRANCES WAS SERIOUS AND MR
HUNSDEN SUBDUED BUT BOTH MUTUALLY POLITE
THEY GOT ON AT THE FRENCH SWIMMINGLY ORDINARY TOPICS WERE DISCUSSED
WITH GREAT STATE AND DECORUM I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN TWO SUCH MODELS
OF PROPRIETY FOR HUNSDEN THANKS TO THE CONSTRAINT OF THE FOREIGN
TONGUE WAS OBLIGED TO SHAPE HIS PHRASES AND MEASURE HIS SENTENCES
WITH A CARE THAT FORBADE ANY ECCENTRICITY
AT LAST ENGLAND WAS
MENTIONED AND FRANCES PROCEEDED TO ASK QUESTIONS
ANIMATED BY DEGREES
SHE BEGAN TO CHANGE JUST AS A GRAVE NIGHT SKY CHANGES AT THE APPROACH
OF SUNRISE FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF HER FOREHEAD CLEARED THEN HER EYES
GLITTERED HER FEATURES RELAXED AND BECAME QUITE MOBILE HER SUBDUED
COMPLEXION GREW WARM AND TRANSPARENT TO ME SHE NOW LOOKED PRETTY
BEFORE SHE HAD ONLY LOOKED LADYLIKE
SHE HAD MANY THINGS TO SAY TO THE ENGLISHMAN JUST FRESH FROM HIS
ISLAND COUNTRY AND SHE URGED HIM WITH AN ENTHUSIASM OF CURIOSITY WHICH
ERE LONG THAWED HUNSDEN'S RESERVE AS FIRE THAWS A CONGEALED VIPER
I USE
THIS NOT VERY FLATTERING COMPARISON BECAUSE HE VIVIDLY REMINDED ME OF A
SNAKE WAKING FROM TORPOR AS HE ERECTED HIS TALL FORM REARED HIS HEAD
BEFORE A LITTLE DECLINED AND PUTTING BACK HIS HAIR FROM HIS BROAD SAXON
FOREHEAD SHOWED UNSHADED THE GLEAM OF ALMOST SAVAGE SATIRE WHICH HIS
INTERLOCUTOR'S TONE OF EAGERNESS AND LOOK OF ARDOUR HAD SUFFICED AT
ONCE TO KINDLE IN HIS SOUL AND ELICIT FROM HIS EYES HE WAS HIMSELF
AS FRANCES WAS HERSELF AND IN NONE BUT HIS OWN LANGUAGE WOULD HE NOW
ADDRESS HER
YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH WAS THE PREFATORY QUESTION
A LITTLE
WELL THEN YOU SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF IT AND FIRST I SEE YOU'VE NOT
MUCH MORE SENSE THAN SOME OTHERS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE INDICATING ME
WITH HIS THUMB OR ELSE YOU'D NEVER TURN RABID ABOUT THAT DIRTY LITTLE
COUNTRY CALLED ENGLAND FOR RABID I SEE YOU ARE I READ ANGLOPHOBIA IN
YOUR LOOKS AND HEAR IT IN YOUR WORDS
WHY MADEMOISELLE IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT ANYBODY WITH A GRAIN OF RATIONALITY SHOULD FEEL ENTHUSIASM ABOUT A
MERE NAME AND THAT NAME ENGLAND I THOUGHT YOU WERE A LADY ABBESS FIVE
MINUTES AGO AND RESPECTED YOU ACCORDINGLY AND NOW I SEE YOU ARE A SORT
OF SWISS SIBYL WITH HIGH TORY AND HIGH CHURCH PRINCIPLES
ENGLAND IS YOUR COUNTRY ASKED FRANCES
YES
AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT
I'D BE SORRY TO LIKE IT A LITTLE CORRUPT VENAL LORD AND KING CURSED
NATION FULL OF MUCKY PRIDE AS THEY SAY IN SHIRE AND HELPLESS
PAUPERISM ROTTEN WITH ABUSES WORM EATEN WITH PREJUDICES
YOU MIGHT SAY SO OF ALMOST EVERY STATE THERE ARE ABUSES AND PREJUDICES
EVERYWHERE AND I THOUGHT FEWER IN ENGLAND THAN IN OTHER COUNTRIES
COME TO ENGLAND AND SEE
COME TO BIRMINGHAM AND MANCHESTER COME TO ST
GILES' IN LONDON AND GET A PRACTICAL NOTION OF HOW OUR SYSTEM WORKS
EXAMINE THE FOOTPRINTS OF OUR AUGUST ARISTOCRACY SEE HOW THEY WALK
IN BLOOD CRUSHING HEARTS AS THEY GO
JUST PUT YOUR HEAD IN AT ENGLISH
COTTAGE DOORS GET A GLIMPSE OF FAMINE CROUCHED TORPID ON BLACK
HEARTHSTONES OF DISEASE LYING BARE ON BEDS WITHOUT COVERLETS OF
INFAMY WANTONING VICIOUSLY WITH IGNORANCE THOUGH INDEED LUXURY IS HER
FAVOURITE PARAMOUR AND PRINCELY HALLS ARE DEARER TO HER THAN THATCHED
HOVELS
I WAS NOT THINKING OF THE WRETCHEDNESS AND VICE IN ENGLAND I WAS
THINKING OF THE GOOD SIDE OF WHAT IS ELEVATED IN YOUR CHARACTER AS A
NATION
THERE IS NO GOOD SIDE NONE AT LEAST OF WHICH YOU CAN HAVE ANY
KNOWLEDGE FOR YOU CANNOT APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF INDUSTRY THE
ACHIEVEMENTS OF ENTERPRISE OR THE DISCOVERIES OF SCIENCE NARROWNESS
OF EDUCATION AND OBSCURITY OF POSITION QUITE INCAPACITATE YOU
FROM UNDERSTANDING THESE POINTS AND AS TO HISTORICAL AND POETICAL
ASSOCIATIONS I WILL NOT INSULT YOU MADEMOISELLE BY SUPPOSING THAT YOU
ALLUDED TO SUCH HUMBUG
BUT I DID PARTLY
HUNSDEN LAUGHED HIS LAUGH OF UNMITIGATED SCORN
I DID MR
HUNSDEN
ARE YOU OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE TO WHOM SUCH
ASSOCIATIONS GIVE NO PLEASURE
MADEMOISELLE WHAT IS AN ASSOCIATION I NEVER SAW ONE
WHAT IS ITS
LENGTH BREADTH WEIGHT VALUE AY VALUE WHAT PRICE WILL IT BRING IN
THE MARKET
YOUR PORTRAIT TO ANY ONE WHO LOVED YOU WOULD FOR THE SAKE OF
ASSOCIATION BE WITHOUT PRICE
THAT INSCRUTABLE HUNSDEN HEARD THIS REMARK AND FELT IT RATHER ACUTELY
TOO SOMEWHERE FOR HE COLOURED A THING NOT UNUSUAL WITH HIM WHEN HIT
UNAWARES ON A TENDER POINT
A SORT OF TROUBLE MOMENTARILY DARKENED
HIS EYE AND I BELIEVE HE FILLED UP THE TRANSIENT PAUSE SUCCEEDING HIS
ANTAGONIST'S HOME THRUST BY A WISH THAT SOME ONE DID LOVE HIM AS
HE WOULD LIKE TO BE LOVED SOME ONE WHOSE LOVE HE COULD UNRESERVEDLY
RETURN
THE LADY PURSUED HER TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE
IF YOUR WORLD IS A WORLD WITHOUT ASSOCIATIONS MR
HUNSDEN I NO LONGER
WONDER THAT YOU HATE ENGLAND SO
I DON'T CLEARLY KNOW WHAT PARADISE IS
AND WHAT ANGELS ARE YET TAKING IT TO BE THE MOST GLORIOUS REGION I CAN
CONCEIVE AND ANGELS THE MOST ELEVATED EXISTENCES IF ONE OF THEM IF
ABDIEL THE FAITHFUL HIMSELF SHE WAS THINKING OF MILTON WERE SUDDENLY
STRIPPED OF THE FACULTY OF ASSOCIATION I THINK HE WOULD SOON RUSH FORTH
FROM 'THE EVER DURING GATES LEAVE HEAVEN AND SEEK WHAT HE HAD LOST IN
HELL
YES IN THE VERY HELL FROM WHICH HE TURNED 'WITH RETORTED SCORN
FRANCES' TONE IN SAYING THIS WAS AS MARKED AS HER LANGUAGE AND IT
WAS WHEN THE WORD HELL TWANGED OFF FROM HER LIPS WITH A SOMEWHAT
STARTLING EMPHASIS THAT HUNSDEN DEIGNED TO BESTOW ONE SLIGHT GLANCE OF
ADMIRATION
HE LIKED SOMETHING STRONG WHETHER IN MAN OR WOMAN HE LIKED
WHATEVER DARED TO CLEAR CONVENTIONAL LIMITS
HE HAD NEVER BEFORE HEARD
A LADY SAY HELL WITH THAT UNCOMPROMISING SORT OF ACCENT AND THE SOUND
PLEASED HIM FROM A LADY'S LIPS HE WOULD FAIN HAVE HAD FRANCES TO STRIKE
THE STRING AGAIN BUT IT WAS NOT IN HER WAY
THE DISPLAY OF ECCENTRIC
VIGOUR NEVER GAVE HER PLEASURE AND IT ONLY SOUNDED IN HER VOICE OR
FLASHED IN HER COUNTENANCE WHEN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THOSE
GENERALLY PAINFUL FORCED IT OUT OF THE DEPTHS WHERE IT BURNED LATENT
TO ME ONCE OR TWICE SHE HAD IN INTIMATE CONVERSATION UTTERED
VENTUROUS THOUGHTS IN NERVOUS LANGUAGE BUT WHEN THE HOUR OF SUCH
MANIFESTATION WAS PAST I COULD NOT RECALL IT IT CAME OF ITSELF AND OF
ITSELF DEPARTED
HUNSDEN'S EXCITATIONS SHE PUT BY SOON WITH A SMILE AND
RECURRING TO THE THEME OF DISPUTATION SAID
SINCE ENGLAND IS NOTHING WHY DO THE CONTINENTAL NATIONS RESPECT HER
SO
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT NO CHILD WOULD HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION REPLIED
HUNSDEN WHO NEVER AT ANY TIME GAVE INFORMATION WITHOUT REPROVING FOR
STUPIDITY THOSE WHO ASKED IT OF HIM
IF YOU HAD BEEN MY PUPIL AS I
SUPPOSE YOU ONCE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE THAT OF A DEPLORABLE CHARACTER
NOT A HUNDRED MILES OFF I WOULD HAVE PUT YOU IN THE CORNER FOR SUCH A
CONFESSION OF IGNORANCE
WHY MADEMOISELLE CAN'T YOU SEE THAT IT IS
OUR GOLD WHICH BUYS US FRENCH POLITENESS GERMAN GOOD WILL AND SWISS
SERVILITY AND HE SNEERED DIABOLICALLY
SWISS SAID FRANCES CATCHING THE WORD SERVILITY DO YOU CALL MY
COUNTRYMEN SERVILE AND SHE STARTED UP
I COULD NOT SUPPRESS A LOW
LAUGH THERE WAS IRE IN HER GLANCE AND DEFIANCE IN HER ATTITUDE
DO
YOU ABUSE SWITZERLAND TO ME MR
HUNSDEN DO YOU THINK I HAVE NO
ASSOCIATIONS DO YOU CALCULATE THAT I AM PREPARED TO DWELL ONLY ON WHAT
VICE AND DEGRADATION MAY BE FOUND IN ALPINE VILLAGES AND TO LEAVE
QUITE OUT OF MY HEART THE SOCIAL GREATNESS OF MY COUNTRYMEN AND OUR
BLOOD EARNED FREEDOM AND THE NATURAL GLORIES OF OUR MOUNTAINS YOU'RE
MISTAKEN YOU'RE MISTAKEN
SOCIAL GREATNESS CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL YOUR COUNTRYMEN ARE SENSIBLE
FELLOWS THEY MAKE A MARKETABLE ARTICLE OF WHAT TO YOU IS AN ABSTRACT
IDEA THEY HAVE ERE THIS SOLD THEIR SOCIAL GREATNESS AND ALSO THEIR
BLOOD EARNED FREEDOM TO BE THE SERVANTS OF FOREIGN KINGS
YOU NEVER WERE IN SWITZERLAND
YES I HAVE BEEN THERE TWICE
YOU KNOW NOTHING OF IT
I DO
AND YOU SAY THE SWISS ARE MERCENARY AS A PARROT SAYS 'POOR POLL OR
AS THE BELGIANS HERE SAY THE ENGLISH ARE NOT BRAVE OR AS THE FRENCH
ACCUSE THEM OF BEING PERFIDIOUS THERE IS NO JUSTICE IN YOUR DICTUMS
THERE IS TRUTH
I TELL YOU MR
HUNSDEN YOU ARE A MORE UNPRACTICAL MAN THAN I AM AN
UNPRACTICAL WOMAN FOR YOU DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT REALLY EXISTS YOU
WANT TO ANNIHILATE INDIVIDUAL PATRIOTISM AND NATIONAL GREATNESS AS
AN ATHEIST WOULD ANNIHILATE GOD AND HIS OWN SOUL BY DENYING THEIR
EXISTENCE
WHERE ARE YOU FLYING TO YOU ARE OFF AT A TANGENT I THOUGHT WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT THE MERCENARY NATURE OF THE SWISS
WE WERE AND IF YOU PROVED TO ME THAT THE SWISS ARE MERCENARY TO MORROW
WHICH YOU CANNOT DO I SHOULD LOVE SWITZERLAND STILL
YOU WOULD BE MAD THEN MAD AS A MARCH HARE TO INDULGE IN A PASSION
FOR MILLIONS OF SHIPLOADS OF SOIL TIMBER SNOW AND ICE
NOT SO MAD AS YOU WHO LOVE NOTHING
THERE'S A METHOD IN MY MADNESS THERE'S NONE IN YOURS
YOUR METHOD IS TO SQUEEZE THE SAP OUT OF CREATION AND MAKE MANURE OF
THE REFUSE BY WAY OF TURNING IT TO WHAT YOU CALL USE
YOU CANNOT REASON AT ALL SAID HUNSDEN THERE IS NO LOGIC IN YOU
BETTER TO BE WITHOUT LOGIC THAN WITHOUT FEELING RETORTED FRANCES WHO
WAS NOW PASSING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FROM HER CUPBOARD TO THE TABLE
INTENT IF NOT ON HOSPITABLE THOUGHTS AT LEAST ON HOSPITABLE DEEDS FOR
SHE WAS LAYING THE CLOTH AND PUTTING PLATES KNIVES AND FORKS THEREON
IS THAT A HIT AT ME MADEMOISELLE DO YOU SUPPOSE I AM WITHOUT
FEELING
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE ALWAYS INTERFERING WITH YOUR OWN FEELINGS AND THOSE
OF OTHER PEOPLE AND DOGMATIZING ABOUT THE IRRATIONALITY OF THIS THAT
AND THE OTHER SENTIMENT AND THEN ORDERING IT TO BE SUPPRESSED BECAUSE
YOU IMAGINE IT TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH LOGIC
I DO RIGHT
FRANCES HAD STEPPED OUT OF SIGHT INTO A SORT OF LITTLE PANTRY SHE SOON
REAPPEARED
YOU DO RIGHT INDEED NO YOU ARE MUCH MISTAKEN IF YOU THINK SO
JUST
BE SO GOOD AS TO LET ME GET TO THE FIRE MR
HUNSDEN I HAVE SOMETHING
TO COOK AN INTERVAL OCCUPIED IN SETTLING A CASSEROLE ON THE FIRE
THEN WHILE SHE STIRRED ITS CONTENTS RIGHT AS IF IT WERE RIGHT TO
CRUSH ANY PLEASURABLE SENTIMENT THAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO MAN ESPECIALLY
ANY SENTIMENT THAT LIKE PATRIOTISM SPREADS MAN'S SELFISHNESS IN WIDER
CIRCLES FIRE STIRRED DISH PUT DOWN BEFORE IT
WERE YOU BORN IN SWITZERLAND
I SHOULD THINK SO OR ELSE WHY SHOULD I CALL IT MY COUNTRY
AND WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR ENGLISH FEATURES AND FIGURE
I AM ENGLISH TOO HALF THE BLOOD IN MY VEINS IS ENGLISH THUS I HAVE
A RIGHT TO A DOUBLE POWER OF PATRIOTISM POSSESSING AN INTEREST IN TWO
NOBLE FREE AND FORTUNATE COUNTRIES
YOU HAD AN ENGLISH MOTHER
YES YES AND YOU I SUPPOSE HAD A MOTHER FROM THE MOON OR FROM
UTOPIA SINCE NOT A NATION IN EUROPE HAS A CLAIM ON YOUR INTEREST
ON THE CONTRARY I'M A UNIVERSAL PATRIOT IF YOU COULD UNDERSTAND ME
RIGHTLY MY COUNTRY IS THE WORLD
SYMPATHIES SO WIDELY DIFFUSED MUST BE VERY SHALLOW WILL YOU HAVE
THE GOODNESS TO COME TO TABLE
MONSIEUR TO ME WHO APPEARED TO BE NOW
ABSORBED IN READING BY MOONLIGHT MONSIEUR SUPPER IS SERVED
THIS WAS SAID IN QUITE A DIFFERENT VOICE TO THAT IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN
BANDYING PHRASES WITH MR
HUNSDEN NOT SO SHORT GRAVER AND SOFTER
FRANCES WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PREPARING SUPPER WE HAD NO INTENTION OF
STAYING
AH MONSIEUR BUT YOU HAVE STAYED AND SUPPER IS PREPARED YOU HAVE
ONLY THE ALTERNATIVE OF EATING IT
THE MEAL WAS A FOREIGN ONE OF COURSE IT CONSISTED IN TWO SMALL BUT
TASTY DISHES OF MEAT PREPARED WITH SKILL AND SERVED WITH NICETY A SALAD
AND FROMAGE FRANCAIS COMPLETED IT
THE BUSINESS OF EATING INTERPOSED
A BRIEF TRUCE BETWEEN THE BELLIGERENTS BUT NO SOONER WAS SUPPER
DISPOSED OF THAN THEY WERE AT IT AGAIN
THE FRESH SUBJECT OF DISPUTE
RAN ON THE SPIRIT OF RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WHICH MR
HUNSDEN AFFIRMED TO
EXIST STRONGLY IN SWITZERLAND NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROFESSED ATTACHMENT
OF THE SWISS TO FREEDOM
HERE FRANCES HAD GREATLY THE WORST OF IT
NOT ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS UNSKILLED TO ARGUE BUT BECAUSE HER OWN REAL
OPINIONS ON THE POINT IN QUESTION HAPPENED TO COINCIDE PRETTY NEARLY
WITH MR
HUNSDEN'S AND SHE ONLY CONTRADICTED HIM OUT OF OPPOSITION
AT
LAST SHE GAVE IN CONFESSING THAT SHE THOUGHT AS HE THOUGHT BUT BIDDING
HIM TAKE NOTICE THAT SHE DID NOT CONSIDER HERSELF BEATEN
NO MORE DID THE FRENCH AT WATERLOO SAID HUNSDEN
THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THE CASES REJOINED FRANCES MINE WAS
A SHAM FIGHT
SHAM OR REAL IT'S UP WITH YOU
NO THOUGH I HAVE NEITHER LOGIC NOR WEALTH OF WORDS YET IN A CASE
WHERE MY OPINION REALLY DIFFERED FROM YOURS I WOULD ADHERE TO IT WHEN
I HAD NOT ANOTHER WORD TO SAY IN ITS DEFENCE YOU SHOULD BE BAFFLED BY
DUMB DETERMINATION
YOU SPEAK OF WATERLOO YOUR WELLINGTON OUGHT TO HAVE
BEEN CONQUERED THERE ACCORDING TO NAPOLEON BUT HE PERSEVERED IN SPITE
OF THE LAWS OF WAR AND WAS VICTORIOUS IN DEFIANCE OF MILITARY TACTICS
I WOULD DO AS HE DID
I'LL BE BOUND FOR IT YOU WOULD PROBABLY YOU HAVE SOME OF THE SAME SORT
OF STUBBORN STUFF IN YOU
I SHOULD BE SORRY IF I HAD NOT HE AND TELL WERE BROTHERS AND I'D
SCORN THE SWISS MAN OR WOMAN WHO HAD NONE OF THE MUCH ENDURING NATURE
OF OUR HEROIC WILLIAM IN HIS SOUL
IF TELL WAS LIKE WELLINGTON HE WAS AN ASS
DOES NOT ASS MEAN BAUDET ASKED FRANCES TURNING TO ME
NO NO REPLIED I IT MEANS AN ESPRIT FORT AND NOW I CONTINUED AS
I SAW THAT FRESH OCCASION OF STRIFE WAS BREWING BETWEEN THESE TWO IT
IS HIGH TIME TO GO
HUNSDEN ROSE
GOOD BYE SAID HE TO FRANCES I SHALL BE OFF FOR THIS
GLORIOUS ENGLAND TO MORROW AND IT MAY BE TWELVE MONTHS OR MORE BEFORE
I COME TO BRUSSELS AGAIN WHENEVER I DO COME I'LL SEEK YOU OUT AND
YOU SHALL SEE IF I DON'T FIND MEANS TO MAKE YOU FIERCER THAN A DRAGON
YOU'VE DONE PRETTY WELL THIS EVENING BUT NEXT INTERVIEW YOU SHALL
CHALLENGE ME OUTRIGHT
MEANTIME YOU'RE DOOMED TO BECOME MRS
WILLIAM
CRIMSWORTH I SUPPOSE POOR YOUNG LADY BUT YOU HAVE A SPARK OF SPIRIT
CHERISH IT AND GIVE THE PROFESSOR THE FULL BENEFIT THEREOF
ARE YOU MARRIED
MR
HUNSDEN ASKED FRANCES SUDDENLY
NO
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE GUESSED I WAS A BENEDICT BY MY
LOOK
WELL WHENEVER YOU MARRY DON'T TAKE A WIFE OUT OF SWITZERLAND FOR IF
YOU BEGIN BLASPHEMING HELVETIA AND CURSING THE CANTONS ABOVE ALL IF
YOU MENTION THE WORD ASS IN THE SAME BREATH WITH THE NAME TELL FOR
ASS IS BAUDET I KNOW THOUGH MONSIEUR IS PLEASED TO TRANSLATE
IT ESPRIT FORT YOUR MOUNTAIN MAID WILL SOME NIGHT SMOTHER HER
BRETON BRETONNANT EVEN AS YOUR OWN SHAKSPEARE'S OTHELLO SMOTHERED
DESDEMONA
I AM WARNED SAID HUNSDEN AND SO ARE YOU LAD NODDING TO ME
I
HOPE YET TO HEAR OF A TRAVESTY OF THE MOOR AND HIS GENTLE LADY IN WHICH
THE PARTS SHALL BE REVERSED ACCORDING TO THE PLAN JUST SKETCHED YOU
HOWEVER BEING IN MY NIGHTCAP
FAREWELL MADEMOISELLE HE BOWED ON HER
HAND ABSOLUTELY LIKE SIR CHARLES GRANDISON ON THAT OF HARRIET BYRON
ADDING DEATH FROM SUCH FINGERS WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT CHARMS
MON DIEU MURMURED FRANCES OPENING HER LARGE EYES AND LIFTING HER
DISTINCTLY ARCHED BROWS C'EST QU'IL FAIT DES COMPLIMENTS JE NE M'Y
SUIS PAS ATTENDU SHE SMILED HALF IN IRE HALF IN MIRTH CURTSIED WITH
FOREIGN GRACE AND SO THEY PARTED
NO SOONER HAD WE GOT INTO THE STREET THAN HUNSDEN COLLARED ME
AND THAT IS YOUR LACE MENDER SAID HE AND YOU RECKON YOU HAVE DONE
A FINE MAGNANIMOUS THING IN OFFERING TO MARRY HER YOU A SCION OF
SEACOMBE HAVE PROVED YOUR DISDAIN OF SOCIAL DISTINCTIONS BY TAKING UP
WITH AN OUVRIERE AND I PITIED THE FELLOW THINKING HIS FEELINGS HAD
MISLED HIM AND THAT HE HAD HURT HIMSELF BY CONTRACTING A LOW MATCH
JUST LET GO MY COLLAR HUNSDEN
ON THE CONTRARY HE SWAYED ME TO AND FRO SO I GRAPPLED HIM ROUND THE
WAIST
IT WAS DARK THE STREET LONELY AND LAMPLESS
WE HAD THEN A
TUG FOR IT AND AFTER WE HAD BOTH ROLLED ON THE PAVEMENT AND WITH
DIFFICULTY PICKED OURSELVES UP WE AGREED TO WALK ON MORE SOBERLY
YES THAT'S MY LACE MENDER SAID I AND SHE IS TO BE MINE FOR
LIFE GOD WILLING
GOD IS NOT WILLING YOU CAN'T SUPPOSE IT WHAT BUSINESS HAVE YOU TO
BE SUITED SO WELL WITH A PARTNER AND SHE TREATS YOU WITH A SORT OF
RESPECT TOO AND SAYS 'MONSIEUR' AND MODULATES HER TONE IN ADDRESSING
YOU ACTUALLY AS IF YOU WERE SOMETHING SUPERIOR SHE COULD NOT EVINCE
MORE DEFERENCE TO SUCH A ONE AS I WERE SHE FAVOURED BY FORTUNE TO THE
SUPREME EXTENT OF BEING MY CHOICE INSTEAD OF YOURS
HUNSDEN YOU'RE A PUPPY
BUT YOU'VE ONLY SEEN THE TITLE PAGE OF MY
HAPPINESS YOU DON'T KNOW THE TALE THAT FOLLOWS YOU CANNOT CONCEIVE THE
INTEREST AND SWEET VARIETY AND THRILLING EXCITEMENT OF THE NARRATIVE
HUNSDEN SPEAKING LOW AND DEEP FOR WE HAD NOW ENTERED A BUSIER
STREET DESIRED ME TO HOLD MY PEACE THREATENING TO DO SOMETHING
DREADFUL IF I STIMULATED HIS WRATH FURTHER BY BOASTING
I LAUGHED TILL
MY SIDES ACHED
WE SOON REACHED HIS HOTEL BEFORE HE ENTERED IT HE
SAID
DON'T BE VAINGLORIOUS
YOUR LACE MENDER IS TOO GOOD FOR YOU BUT NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME NEITHER PHYSICALLY NOR MORALLY DOES SHE COME UP
TO MY IDEAL OF A WOMAN
NO I DREAM OF SOMETHING FAR BEYOND THAT
PALE FACED EXCITABLE LITTLE HELVETIAN BY THE BY SHE HAS INFINITELY
MORE OF THE NERVOUS MOBILE PARISIENNE IN HER THAN OF THE THE ROBUST
'JUNGFRAU'
YOUR MDLLE
HENRI IS IN PERSON CHETIVE IN MIND SANS
CARACTERE COMPARED WITH THE QUEEN OF MY VISIONS
YOU INDEED MAY PUT
UP WITH THAT MINOIS CHIFFONE BUT WHEN I MARRY I MUST HAVE STRAIGHTER
AND MORE HARMONIOUS FEATURES TO SAY NOTHING OF A NOBLER AND BETTER
DEVELOPED SHAPE THAN THAT PERVERSE ILL THRIVEN CHILD CAN BOAST
BRIBE A SERAPH TO FETCH YOU A COAL OF FIRE FROM HEAVEN IF YOU WILL
SAID I AND WITH IT KINDLE LIFE IN THE TALLEST FATTEST MOST BONELESS
FULLEST BLOODED OF RUBEN'S PAINTED WOMEN LEAVE ME ONLY MY ALPINE PERI
AND I'LL NOT ENVY YOU
WITH A SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENT EACH TURNED HIS BACK ON THE OTHER
NEITHER
SAID GOD BLESS YOU YET ON THE MORROW THE SEA WAS TO ROLL BETWEEN US
CHAPTER XXV
IN TWO MONTHS MORE FRANCES HAD FULFILLED THE TIME OF MOURNING FOR HER
AUNT
ONE JANUARY MORNING THE FIRST OF THE NEW YEAR HOLIDAYS I WENT IN
A FIACRE ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY M
VANDENHUTEN TO THE RUE NOTRE DAME AUX
NEIGES AND HAVING ALIGHTED ALONE AND WALKED UPSTAIRS I FOUND FRANCES
APPARENTLY WAITING FOR ME DRESSED IN A STYLE SCARCELY APPROPRIATE TO
THAT COLD BRIGHT FROSTY DAY
NEVER TILL NOW HAD I SEEN HER ATTIRED IN
ANY OTHER THAN BLACK OR SAD COLOURED STUFF AND THERE SHE STOOD BY THE
WINDOW CLAD ALL IN WHITE AND WHITE OF A MOST DIAPHANOUS TEXTURE HER
ARRAY WAS VERY SIMPLE TO BE SURE BUT IT LOOKED IMPOSING AND FESTAL
BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLEAR FULL AND FLOATING A VEIL SHADOWED HER HEAD
AND HUNG BELOW HER KNEE A LITTLE WREATH OF PINK FLOWERS FASTENED IT
TO HER THICKLY TRESSED GRECIAN PLAIT AND THENCE IT FELL SOFTLY ON EACH
SIDE OF HER FACE
SINGULAR TO STATE SHE WAS OR HAD BEEN CRYING WHEN
I ASKED HER IF SHE WERE READY SHE SAID YES MONSIEUR WITH SOMETHING
VERY LIKE A CHECKED SOB AND WHEN I TOOK A SHAWL WHICH LAY ON THE
TABLE AND FOLDED IT ROUND HER NOT ONLY DID TEAR AFTER TEAR COURSE
UNBIDDEN DOWN HER CHEEK BUT SHE SHOOK TO MY MINISTRATION LIKE A REED
I SAID I WAS SORRY TO SEE HER IN SUCH LOW SPIRITS AND REQUESTED TO
BE ALLOWED AN INSIGHT INTO THE ORIGIN THEREOF
SHE ONLY SAID IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP IT AND THEN VOLUNTARILY THOUGH HURRIEDLY PUTTING
HER HAND INTO MINE ACCOMPANIED ME OUT OF THE ROOM AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS
WITH A QUICK UNCERTAIN STEP LIKE ONE WHO WAS EAGER TO GET SOME
FORMIDABLE PIECE OF BUSINESS OVER
I PUT HER INTO THE FIACRE
M
VANDENHUTEN RECEIVED HER AND SEATED HER BESIDE HIMSELF WE DROVE ALL
TOGETHER TO THE PROTESTANT CHAPEL WENT THROUGH A CERTAIN SERVICE IN THE
COMMON PRAYER BOOK AND SHE AND I CAME OUT MARRIED
M
VANDENHUTEN HAD
GIVEN THE BRIDE AWAY
WE TOOK NO BRIDAL TRIP OUR MODESTY SCREENED BY THE PEACEFUL OBSCURITY
OF OUR STATION AND THE PLEASANT ISOLATION OF OUR CIRCUMSTANCES DID NOT
EXACT THAT ADDITIONAL PRECAUTION
WE REPAIRED AT ONCE TO A SMALL HOUSE
I HAD TAKEN IN THE FAUBOURG NEAREST TO THAT PART OF THE CITY WHERE THE
SCENE OF OUR AVOCATIONS LAY
THREE OR FOUR HOURS AFTER THE WEDDING CEREMONY FRANCES DIVESTED OF HER
BRIDAL SNOW AND ATTIRED IN A PRETTY LILAC GOWN OF WARMER MATERIALS
A PIQUANT BLACK SILK APRON AND A LACE COLLAR WITH SOME FINISHING
DECORATION OF LILAC RIBBON WAS KNEELING ON THE CARPET OF A NEATLY
FURNISHED THOUGH NOT SPACIOUS PARLOUR ARRANGING ON THE SHELVES OF A
CHIFFONIERE SOME BOOKS WHICH I HANDED TO HER FROM THE TABLE
IT WAS
SNOWING FAST OUT OF DOORS THE AFTERNOON HAD TURNED OUT WILD AND
COLD THE LEADEN SKY SEEMED FULL OF DRIFTS AND THE STREET WAS ALREADY
ANKLE DEEP IN THE WHITE DOWNFALL
OUR FIRE BURNED BRIGHT OUR NEW
HABITATION LOOKED BRILLIANTLY CLEAN AND FRESH THE FURNITURE WAS ALL
ARRANGED AND THERE WERE BUT SOME ARTICLES OF GLASS CHINA BOOKS
C TO PUT IN ORDER
FRANCES FOUND IN THIS BUSINESS OCCUPATION TILL
TEA TIME AND THEN AFTER I HAD DISTINCTLY INSTRUCTED HER HOW TO MAKE
A CUP OF TEA IN RATIONAL ENGLISH STYLE AND AFTER SHE HAD GOT OVER THE
DISMAY OCCASIONED BY SEEING SUCH AN EXTRAVAGANT AMOUNT OF MATERIAL PUT
INTO THE POT SHE ADMINISTERED TO ME A PROPER BRITISH REPAST AT WHICH
THERE WANTED NEITHER CANDLES NOR URN FIRELIGHT NOR COMFORT
OUR WEEK'S HOLIDAY GLIDED BY AND WE READDRESSED OURSELVES TO LABOUR
BOTH MY WIFE AND I BEGAN IN GOOD EARNEST WITH THE NOTION THAT WE WERE
WORKING PEOPLE DESTINED TO EARN OUR BREAD BY EXERTION AND THAT OF THE
MOST ASSIDUOUS KIND
OUR DAYS WERE THOROUGHLY OCCUPIED WE USED TO PART
EVERY MORNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND NOT MEET AGAIN TILL FIVE P M BUT
INTO WHAT SWEET REST DID THE TURMOIL OF EACH BUSY DAY DECLINE LOOKING
DOWN THE VISTA OF MEMORY I SEE THE EVENINGS PASSED IN THAT LITTLE
PARLOUR LIKE A LONG STRING OF RUBIES CIRCLING THE DUSKY BROW OF THE PAST
UNVARIED WERE THEY AS EACH CUT GEM AND LIKE EACH GEM BRILLIANT AND
BURNING
A YEAR AND A HALF PASSED
ONE MORNING IT WAS A FETE AND WE HAD THE DAY
TO OURSELVES FRANCES SAID TO ME WITH A SUDDENNESS PECULIAR TO HER WHEN
SHE HAD BEEN THINKING LONG ON A SUBJECT AND AT LAST HAVING COME TO
A CONCLUSION WISHED TO TEST ITS SOUNDNESS BY THE TOUCHSTONE OF MY
JUDGMENT
I DON'T WORK ENOUGH
WHAT NOW DEMANDED I LOOKING UP FROM MY COFFEE WHICH I HAD BEEN
DELIBERATELY STIRRING WHILE ENJOYING IN ANTICIPATION A WALK I PROPOSED
TO TAKE WITH FRANCES THAT FINE SUMMER DAY IT WAS JUNE TO A CERTAIN
FARMHOUSE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE WE WERE TO DINE
WHAT NOW AND I
SAW AT ONCE IN THE SERIOUS ARDOUR OF HER FACE A PROJECT OF VITAL
IMPORTANCE
I AM NOT SATISFIED RETURNED SHE YOU ARE NOW EARNING EIGHT THOUSAND
FRANCS A YEAR IT WAS TRUE MY EFFORTS PUNCTUALITY THE FAME OF MY
PUPILS' PROGRESS THE PUBLICITY OF MY STATION HAD SO FAR HELPED ME
ON WHILE I AM STILL AT MY MISERABLE TWELVE HUNDRED FRANCS
I CAN DO
BETTER AND I WILL
YOU WORK AS LONG AND AS DILIGENTLY AS I DO FRANCES
YES MONSIEUR BUT I AM NOT WORKING IN THE RIGHT WAY AND I AM
CONVINCED OF IT
YOU WISH TO CHANGE YOU HAVE A PLAN FOR PROGRESS IN YOUR MIND GO AND
PUT ON YOUR BONNET AND WHILE WE TAKE OUR WALK YOU SHALL TELL ME OF
IT
YES MONSIEUR
SHE WENT AS DOCILE AS A WELL TRAINED CHILD SHE WAS A CURIOUS MIXTURE
OF TRACTABILITY AND FIRMNESS I SAT THINKING ABOUT HER AND WONDERING
WHAT HER PLAN COULD BE WHEN SHE RE ENTERED
MONSIEUR I HAVE GIVEN MINNIE OUR BONNE LEAVE TO GO OUT TOO AS IT
IS SO VERY FINE SO WILL YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO LOCK THE DOOR AND TAKE
THE KEY WITH YOU
KISS ME MRS
CRIMSWORTH WAS MY NOT VERY APPOSITE REPLY BUT SHE
LOOKED SO ENGAGING IN HER LIGHT SUMMER DRESS AND LITTLE COTTAGE BONNET
AND HER MANNER IN SPEAKING TO ME WAS THEN AS ALWAYS SO UNAFFECTEDLY
AND SUAVELY RESPECTFUL THAT MY HEART EXPANDED AT THE SIGHT OF HER AND
A KISS SEEMED NECESSARY TO CONTENT ITS IMPORTUNITY
THERE MONSIEUR
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS CALL ME 'MONSIEUR' SAY 'WILLIAM
I CANNOT PRONOUNCE YOUR W BESIDES 'MONSIEUR' BELONGS TO YOU I LIKE
IT BEST
MINNIE HAVING DEPARTED IN CLEAN CAP AND SMART SHAWL WE TOO SET OUT
LEAVING THE HOUSE SOLITARY AND SILENT SILENT AT LEAST BUT FOR
THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK
WE WERE SOON CLEAR OF BRUSSELS THE FIELDS
RECEIVED US AND THEN THE LANES REMOTE FROM CARRIAGE RESOUNDING
CHAUSSEES
ERE LONG WE CAME UPON A NOOK SO RURAL GREEN AND SECLUDED
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SPOT IN SOME PASTORAL ENGLISH PROVINCE A BANK OF
SHORT AND MOSSY GRASS UNDER A HAWTHORN OFFERED A SEAT TOO TEMPTING
TO BE DECLINED WE TOOK IT AND WHEN WE HAD ADMIRED AND EXAMINED SOME
ENGLISH LOOKING WILD FLOWERS GROWING AT OUR FEET I RECALLED FRANCES'
ATTENTION AND MY OWN TO THE TOPIC TOUCHED ON AT BREAKFAST
WHAT WAS HER PLAN A NATURAL ONE THE NEXT STEP TO BE MOUNTED BY
US OR AT LEAST BY HER IF SHE WANTED TO RISE IN HER PROFESSION
SHE
PROPOSED TO BEGIN A SCHOOL
WE ALREADY HAD THE MEANS FOR COMMENCING ON
A CAREFUL SCALE HAVING LIVED GREATLY WITHIN OUR INCOME
WE POSSESSED
TOO BY THIS TIME AN EXTENSIVE AND ELIGIBLE CONNECTION IN THE SENSE
ADVANTAGEOUS TO OUR BUSINESS FOR THOUGH OUR CIRCLE OF VISITING
ACQUAINTANCE CONTINUED AS LIMITED AS EVER WE WERE NOW WIDELY KNOWN IN
SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES AS TEACHERS
WHEN FRANCES HAD DEVELOPED HER PLAN
SHE INTIMATED IN SOME CLOSING SENTENCES HER HOPES FOR THE FUTURE
IF
WE ONLY HAD GOOD HEALTH AND TOLERABLE SUCCESS ME MIGHT SHE WAS SURE
IN TIME REALIZE AN INDEPENDENCY AND THAT PERHAPS BEFORE WE WERE TOO
OLD TO ENJOY IT THEN BOTH SHE AND I WOULD REST AND WHAT WAS TO HINDER
US FROM GOING TO LIVE IN ENGLAND ENGLAND WAS STILL HER PROMISED LAND
I PUT NO OBSTACLE IN HER WAY RAISED NO OBJECTION I KNEW SHE WAS
NOT ONE WHO COULD LIVE QUIESCENT AND INACTIVE OR EVEN COMPARATIVELY
INACTIVE
DUTIES SHE MUST HAVE TO FULFIL AND IMPORTANT DUTIES WORK TO
DO AND EXCITING ABSORBING PROFITABLE WORK STRONG FACULTIES STIRRED
IN HER FRAME AND THEY DEMANDED FULL NOURISHMENT FREE EXERCISE MINE
WAS NOT THE HAND EVER TO STARVE OR CRAMP THEM NO I DELIGHTED IN
OFFERING THEM SUSTENANCE AND IN CLEARING THEM WIDER SPACE FOR ACTION
YOU HAVE CONCEIVED A PLAN FRANCES SAID I AND A GOOD PLAN EXECUTE
IT YOU HAVE MY FREE CONSENT AND WHEREVER AND WHENEVER MY ASSISTANCE IS
WANTED ASK AND YOU SHALL HAVE
FRANCES' EYES THANKED ME ALMOST WITH TEARS JUST A SPARKLE OR TWO SOON
BRUSHED AWAY SHE POSSESSED HERSELF OF MY HAND TOO AND HELD IT FOR
SOME TIME VERY CLOSE CLASPED IN BOTH HER OWN BUT SHE SAID NO MORE THAN
THANK YOU MONSIEUR
WE PASSED A DIVINE DAY AND CAME HOME LATE LIGHTED BY A FULL SUMMER
MOON
TEN YEARS RUSHED NOW UPON ME WITH DUSTY VIBRATING UNRESTING WINGS
YEARS OF BUSTLE ACTION UNSLACKED ENDEAVOUR YEARS IN WHICH I AND
MY WIFE HAVING LAUNCHED OURSELVES IN THE FULL CAREER OF PROGRESS AS
PROGRESS WHIRLS ON IN EUROPEAN CAPITALS SCARCELY KNEW REPOSE WERE
STRANGERS TO AMUSEMENT NEVER THOUGHT OF INDULGENCE AND YET AS
OUR COURSE RAN SIDE BY SIDE AS WE MARCHED HAND IN HAND WE NEITHER
MURMURED REPENTED NOR FALTERED
HOPE INDEED CHEERED US HEALTH KEPT US
UP HARMONY OF THOUGHT AND DEED SMOOTHED MANY DIFFICULTIES AND FINALLY
SUCCESS BESTOWED EVERY NOW AND THEN ENCOURAGING REWARD ON DILIGENCE
OUR
SCHOOL BECAME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR IN BRUSSELS AND AS BY DEGREES
WE RAISED OUR TERMS AND ELEVATED OUR SYSTEM OF EDUCATION OUR CHOICE OF
PUPILS GREW MORE SELECT AND AT LENGTH INCLUDED THE CHILDREN OF THE
BEST FAMILIES IN BELGIUM
WE HAD TOO AN EXCELLENT CONNECTION IN ENGLAND
FIRST OPENED BY THE UNSOLICITED RECOMMENDATION OF MR
HUNSDEN WHO
HAVING BEEN OVER AND HAVING ABUSED ME FOR MY PROSPERITY IN SET TERMS
WENT BACK AND SOON AFTER SENT A LEASH OF YOUNG SHIRE HEIRESSES HIS
COUSINS AS HE SAID TO BE POLISHED OFF BY MRS
CRIMSWORTH
AS TO THIS SAME MRS
CRIMSWORTH IN ONE SENSE SHE WAS BECOME ANOTHER
WOMAN THOUGH IN ANOTHER SHE REMAINED UNCHANGED
SO DIFFERENT WAS
SHE UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES
I SEEMED TO POSSESS TWO WIVES
THE
FACULTIES OF HER NATURE ALREADY DISCLOSED WHEN I MARRIED HER REMAINED
FRESH AND FAIR BUT OTHER FACULTIES SHOT UP STRONG BRANCHED OUT
BROAD AND QUITE ALTERED THE EXTERNAL CHARACTER OF THE PLANT
FIRMNESS
ACTIVITY AND ENTERPRISE COVERED WITH GRAVE FOLIAGE POETIC FEELING
AND FERVOUR BUT THESE FLOWERS WERE STILL THERE PRESERVED PURE AND DEWY
UNDER THE UMBRAGE OF LATER GROWTH AND HARDIER NATURE PERHAPS I ONLY IN
THE WORLD KNEW THE SECRET OF THEIR EXISTENCE BUT TO ME THEY WERE EVER
READY TO YIELD AN EXQUISITE FRAGRANCE AND PRESENT A BEAUTY AS CHASTE AS
RADIANT
IN THE DAYTIME MY HOUSE AND ESTABLISHMENT WERE CONDUCTED BY MADAME THE
DIRECTRESS A STATELY AND ELEGANT WOMAN BEARING MUCH ANXIOUS THOUGHT ON
HER LARGE BROW MUCH CALCULATED DIGNITY IN HER SERIOUS MIEN IMMEDIATELY
AFTER BREAKFAST I USED TO PART WITH THIS LADY I WENT TO MY COLLEGE
SHE TO HER SCHOOLROOM RETURNING FOR AN HOUR IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY
I FOUND HER ALWAYS IN CLASS INTENTLY OCCUPIED SILENCE INDUSTRY
OBSERVANCE ATTENDING ON HER PRESENCE
WHEN NOT ACTUALLY TEACHING
SHE WAS OVERLOOKING AND GUIDING BY EYE AND GESTURE SHE THEN APPEARED
VIGILANT AND SOLICITOUS
WHEN COMMUNICATING INSTRUCTION HER ASPECT WAS
MORE ANIMATED SHE SEEMED TO FEEL A CERTAIN ENJOYMENT IN THE OCCUPATION
THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH SHE ADDRESSED HER PUPILS THOUGH SIMPLE AND
UNPRETENDING WAS NEVER TRITE OR DRY SHE DID NOT SPEAK FROM ROUTINE
FORMULAS SHE MADE HER OWN PHRASES AS SHE WENT ON AND VERY NERVOUS
AND IMPRESSIVE PHRASES THEY FREQUENTLY WERE OFTEN WHEN ELUCIDATING
FAVOURITE POINTS OF HISTORY OR GEOGRAPHY SHE WOULD WAX GENUINELY
ELOQUENT IN HER EARNESTNESS
HER PUPILS OR AT LEAST THE ELDER AND MORE
INTELLIGENT AMONGST THEM RECOGNIZED WELL THE LANGUAGE OF A SUPERIOR
MIND THEY FELT TOO AND SOME OF THEM RECEIVED THE IMPRESSION OF
ELEVATED SENTIMENTS THERE WAS LITTLE FONDLING BETWEEN MISTRESS AND
GIRLS BUT SOME OF FRANCES' PUPILS IN TIME LEARNT TO LOVE HER SINCERELY
ALL OF THEM BEHELD HER WITH RESPECT HER GENERAL DEMEANOUR TOWARDS
THEM WAS SERIOUS SOMETIMES BENIGNANT WHEN THEY PLEASED HER WITH THEIR
PROGRESS AND ATTENTION ALWAYS SCRUPULOUSLY REFINED AND CONSIDERATE
IN CASES WHERE REPROOF OR PUNISHMENT WAS CALLED FOR SHE WAS USUALLY
FORBEARING ENOUGH BUT IF ANY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT FORBEARANCE WHICH
SOMETIMES HAPPENED A SHARP SUDDEN AND LIGHTNING LIKE SEVERITY TAUGHT
THE CULPRIT THE EXTENT OF THE MISTAKE COMMITTED
SOMETIMES A GLEAM OF
TENDERNESS SOFTENED HER EYES AND MANNER BUT THIS WAS RARE ONLY WHEN
A PUPIL WAS SICK OR WHEN IT PINED AFTER HOME OR IN THE CASE OF SOME
LITTLE MOTHERLESS CHILD OR OF ONE MUCH POORER THAN ITS COMPANIONS
WHOSE SCANTY WARDROBE AND MEAN APPOINTMENTS BROUGHT ON IT THE CONTEMPT
OF THE JEWELLED YOUNG COUNTESSES AND SILK CLAD MISSES
OVER SUCH FEEBLE
FLEDGLINGS THE DIRECTRESS SPREAD A WING OF KINDLIEST PROTECTION IT WAS
TO THEIR BEDSIDE SHE CAME AT NIGHT TO TUCK THEM WARMLY IN IT WAS AFTER
THEM SHE LOOKED IN WINTER TO SEE THAT THEY ALWAYS HAD A COMFORTABLE SEAT
BY THE STOVE IT WAS THEY WHO BY TURNS WERE SUMMONED TO THE SALON TO
RECEIVE SOME LITTLE DOLE OF CAKE OR FRUIT TO SIT ON A FOOTSTOOL AT
THE FIRESIDE TO ENJOY HOME COMFORTS AND ALMOST HOME LIBERTY FOR
AN EVENING TOGETHER TO BE SPOKEN TO GENTLY AND SOFTLY COMFORTED
ENCOURAGED CHERISHED AND WHEN BEDTIME CAME DISMISSED WITH A KISS
OF TRUE TENDERNESS
AS TO JULIA AND GEORGIANA G DAUGHTERS OF AN
ENGLISH BARONET AS TO MDLLE
MATHILDE DE HEIRESS OF A BELGIAN
COUNT AND SUNDRY OTHER CHILDREN OF PATRICIAN RACE THE DIRECTRESS WAS
CAREFUL OF THEM AS OF THE OTHERS ANXIOUS FOR THEIR PROGRESS AS FOR
THAT OF THE REST BUT IT NEVER SEEMED TO ENTER HER HEAD TO DISTINGUISH
THEM BY A MARK OF PREFERENCE ONE GIRL OF NOBLE BLOOD SHE LOVED
DEARLY A YOUNG IRISH BARONESS LADY CATHERINE BUT IT WAS FOR HER
ENTHUSIASTIC HEART AND CLEVER HEAD FOR HER GENEROSITY AND HER GENIUS
THE TITLE AND RANK WENT FOR NOTHING
MY AFTERNOONS WERE SPENT ALSO IN COLLEGE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AN HOUR
THAT MY WIFE DAILY EXACTED OF ME FOR HER ESTABLISHMENT AND WITH WHICH
SHE WOULD NOT DISPENSE
SHE SAID THAT I MUST SPEND THAT TIME AMONGST HER
PUPILS TO LEARN THEIR CHARACTERS TO BE AU COURANT WITH EVERYTHING THAT
WAS PASSING IN THE HOUSE TO BECOME INTERESTED IN WHAT INTERESTED HER
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE HER MY OPINION ON KNOTTY POINTS WHEN SHE REQUIRED IT
AND THIS SHE DID CONSTANTLY NEVER ALLOWING MY INTEREST IN THE PUPILS
TO FALL ASLEEP AND NEVER MAKING ANY CHANGE OF IMPORTANCE WITHOUT
MY COGNIZANCE AND CONSENT
SHE DELIGHTED TO SIT BY ME WHEN I GAVE MY
LESSONS LESSONS IN LITERATURE HER HANDS FOLDED ON HER KNEE THE MOST
FIXEDLY ATTENTIVE OF ANY PRESENT
SHE RARELY ADDRESSED ME IN CLASS WHEN
SHE DID IT WAS WITH AN AIR OF MARKED DEFERENCE IT WAS HER PLEASURE HER
JOY TO MAKE ME STILL THE MASTER IN ALL THINGS
AT SIX O'CLOCK P M
MY DAILY LABOURS CEASED
I THEN CAME HOME FOR
MY HOME WAS MY HEAVEN EVER AT THAT HOUR AS I ENTERED OUR PRIVATE
SITTING ROOM THE LADY DIRECTRESS VANISHED FROM BEFORE MY EYES AND
FRANCES HENRI MY OWN LITTLE LACE MENDER WAS MAGICALLY RESTORED TO MY
ARMS MUCH DISAPPOINTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF HER MASTER HAD NOT BEEN
AS CONSTANT TO THE TRYST AS HERSELF AND IF HIS TRUTHFULL KISS HAD NOT
BEEN PROMPT TO ANSWER HER SOFT BON SOIR MONSIEUR
TALK FRENCH TO ME SHE WOULD AND MANY A PUNISHMENT SHE HAS HAD FOR
HER WILFULNESS
I FEAR THE CHOICE OF CHASTISEMENT MUST HAVE BEEN
INJUDICIOUS FOR INSTEAD OF CORRECTING THE FAULT IT SEEMED TO ENCOURAGE
ITS RENEWAL
OUR EVENINGS WERE OUR OWN THAT RECREATION WAS NECESSARY TO
REFRESH OUR STRENGTH FOR THE DUE DISCHARGE OF OUR DUTIES SOMETIMES WE
SPENT THEM ALL IN CONVERSATION AND MY YOUNG GENEVESE NOW THAT SHE WAS
THOROUGHLY ACCUSTOMED TO HER ENGLISH PROFESSOR NOW THAT SHE LOVED
HIM TOO ABSOLUTELY TO FEAR HIM MUCH REPOSED IN HIM A CONFIDENCE SO
UNLIMITED THAT TOPICS OF CONVERSATION COULD NO MORE BE WANTING WITH HIM
THAN SUBJECTS FOR COMMUNION WITH HER OWN HEART
IN THOSE MOMENTS HAPPY
AS A BIRD WITH ITS MATE SHE WOULD SHOW ME WHAT SHE HAD OF VIVACITY OF
MIRTH OF ORIGINALITY IN HER WELL DOWERED NATURE
SHE WOULD SHOW TOO
SOME STORES OF RAILLERY OF MALICE AND WOULD VEX TEASE PIQUE ME
SOMETIMES ABOUT WHAT SHE CALLED MY BIZARRERIES ANGLAISES MY CAPRICES
INSULAIRES WITH A WILD AND WITTY WICKEDNESS THAT MADE A PERFECT WHITE
DEMON OF HER WHILE IT LASTED
THIS WAS RARE HOWEVER AND THE ELFISH
FREAK WAS ALWAYS SHORT SOMETIMES WHEN DRIVEN A LITTLE HARD IN THE WAR
OF WORDS FOR HER TONGUE DID AMPLE JUSTICE TO THE PITH THE POINT THE
DELICACY OF HER NATIVE FRENCH IN WHICH LANGUAGE SHE ALWAYS ATTACKED
ME I USED TO TURN UPON HER WITH MY OLD DECISION AND ARREST BODILY THE
SPRITE THAT TEASED ME
VAIN IDEA NO SOONER HAD I GRASPED HAND OR ARM
THAN THE ELF WAS GONE THE PROVOCATIVE SMILE QUENCHED IN THE EXPRESSIVE
BROWN EYES AND A RAY OF GENTLE HOMAGE SHONE UNDER THE LIDS IN ITS
PLACE
I HAD SEIZED A MERE VEXING FAIRY AND FOUND A SUBMISSIVE AND
SUPPLICATING LITTLE MORTAL WOMAN IN MY ARMS
THEN I MADE HER GET A BOOK
AND READ ENGLISH TO ME FOR AN HOUR BY WAY OF PENANCE
I FREQUENTLY DOSED
HER WITH WORDSWORTH IN THIS WAY AND WORDSWORTH STEADIED HER SOON SHE
HAD A DIFFICULTY IN COMPREHENDING HIS DEEP SERENE AND SOBER MIND HIS
LANGUAGE TOO WAS NOT FACILE TO HER SHE HAD TO ASK QUESTIONS TO SUE
FOR EXPLANATIONS TO BE LIKE A CHILD AND A NOVICE AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE
ME AS HER SENIOR AND DIRECTOR
HER INSTINCT INSTANTLY PENETRATED AND
POSSESSED THE MEANING OF MORE ARDENT AND IMAGINATIVE WRITERS
BYRON
EXCITED HER SCOTT SHE LOVED WORDSWORTH ONLY SHE PUZZLED AT WONDERED
OVER AND HESITATED TO PRONOUNCE AN OPINION UPON
BUT WHETHER SHE READ TO ME OR TALKED WITH ME WHETHER SHE TEASED ME
IN FRENCH OR ENTREATED ME IN ENGLISH WHETHER SHE JESTED WITH WIT
OR INQUIRED WITH DEFERENCE NARRATED WITH INTEREST OR LISTENED WITH
ATTENTION WHETHER SHE SMILED AT ME OR ON ME ALWAYS AT NINE O'CLOCK I
WAS LEFT ABANDONED
SHE WOULD EXTRICATE HERSELF FROM MY ARMS QUIT
MY SIDE TAKE HER LAMP AND BE GONE
HER MISSION WAS UPSTAIRS I HAVE
FOLLOWED HER SOMETIMES AND WATCHED HER
FIRST SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE
DORTOIR THE PUPILS' CHAMBER NOISELESSLY SHE GLIDED UP THE LONG ROOM
BETWEEN THE TWO ROWS OF WHITE BEDS SURVEYED ALL THE SLEEPERS IF ANY
WERE WAKEFUL ESPECIALLY IF ANY WERE SAD SPOKE TO THEM AND SOOTHED
THEM STOOD SOME MINUTES TO ASCERTAIN THAT ALL WAS SAFE AND TRANQUIL
TRIMMED THE WATCH LIGHT WHICH BURNED IN THE APARTMENT ALL NIGHT THEN
WITHDREW CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITHOUT SOUND
THENCE SHE GLIDED
TO OUR OWN CHAMBER IT HAD A LITTLE CABINET WITHIN THIS SHE SOUGHT
THERE TOO APPEARED A BED BUT ONE AND THAT A VERY SMALL ONE HER FACE
THE NIGHT I FOLLOWED AND OBSERVED HER CHANGED AS SHE APPROACHED THIS
TINY COUCH FROM GRAVE IT WARMED TO EARNEST SHE SHADED WITH ONE HAND
THE LAMP SHE HELD IN THE OTHER SHE BENT ABOVE THE PILLOW AND HUNG
OVER A CHILD ASLEEP ITS SLUMBER THAT EVENING AT LEAST AND USUALLY
I BELIEVE WAS SOUND AND CALM NO TEAR WET ITS DARK EYELASHES NO FEVER
HEATED ITS ROUND CHEEK NO ILL DREAM DISCOMPOSED ITS BUDDING FEATURES
FRANCES GAZED SHE DID NOT SMILE AND YET THE DEEPEST DELIGHT FILLED
FLUSHED HER FACE FEELING PLEASURABLE POWERFUL WORKED IN HER WHOLE
FRAME WHICH STILL WAS MOTIONLESS
I SAW INDEED HER HEART HEAVE HER
LIPS WERE A LITTLE APART HER BREATHING GREW SOMEWHAT HURRIED THE CHILD
SMILED THEN AT LAST THE MOTHER SMILED TOO AND SAID IN LOW SOLILOQUY
GOD BLESS MY LITTLE SON SHE STOOPED CLOSER OVER HIM BREATHED THE
SOFTEST OF KISSES ON HIS BROW COVERED HIS MINUTE HAND WITH HERS AND
AT LAST STARTED UP AND CAME AWAY
I REGAINED THE PARLOUR BEFORE HER
ENTERING IT TWO MINUTES LATER SHE SAID QUIETLY AS SHE PUT DOWN HER
EXTINGUISHED LAMP
VICTOR RESTS WELL HE SMILED IN HIS SLEEP HE HAS YOUR SMILE
MONSIEUR
THE SAID VICTOR WAS OF COURSE HER OWN BOY BORN IN THE THIRD YEAR OF
OUR MARRIAGE HIS CHRISTIAN NAME HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM IN HONOUR OF M
VANDENHUTEN WHO CONTINUED ALWAYS OUR TRUSTY AND WELL BELOVED FRIEND
FRANCES WAS THEN A GOOD AND DEAR WIFE TO ME BECAUSE I WAS TO HER A
GOOD JUST AND FAITHFUL HUSBAND
WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD SHE
MARRIED A HARSH ENVIOUS CARELESS MAN A PROFLIGATE A PRODIGAL
A DRUNKARD OR A TYRANT IS ANOTHER QUESTION AND ONE WHICH I ONCE
PROPOUNDED TO HER
HER ANSWER GIVEN AFTER SOME REFLECTION WAS
I SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO ENDURE THE EVIL OR CURE IT FOR AWHILE AND WHEN
I FOUND IT INTOLERABLE AND INCURABLE I SHOULD HAVE LEFT MY TORTURER
SUDDENLY AND SILENTLY
AND IF LAW OR MIGHT HAD FORCED YOU BACK AGAIN
WHAT TO A DRUNKARD A PROFLIGATE A SELFISH SPENDTHRIFT AN UNJUST
FOOL
YES
I WOULD HAVE GONE BACK AGAIN ASSURED MYSELF WHETHER OR NOT HIS VICE
AND MY MISERY WERE CAPABLE OF REMEDY AND IF NOT HAVE LEFT HIM AGAIN
AND IF AGAIN FORCED TO RETURN AND COMPELLED TO ABIDE
I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID HASTILY
WHY DO YOU ASK ME MONSIEUR
I WOULD HAVE AN ANSWER BECAUSE I SAW A STRANGE KIND OF SPIRIT IN HER
EYE WHOSE VOICE I DETERMINED TO WAKEN
MONSIEUR IF A WIFE'S NATURE LOATHES THAT OF THE MAN SHE IS WEDDED TO
MARRIAGE MUST BE SLAVERY
AGAINST SLAVERY ALL RIGHT THINKERS REVOLT AND
THOUGH TORTURE BE THE PRICE OF RESISTANCE TORTURE MUST BE DARED THOUGH
THE ONLY ROAD TO FREEDOM LIE THROUGH THE GATES OF DEATH THOSE GATES
MUST BE PASSED FOR FREEDOM IS INDISPENSABLE
THEN MONSIEUR I WOULD
RESIST AS FAR AS MY STRENGTH PERMITTED WHEN THAT STRENGTH FAILED I
SHOULD BE SURE OF A REFUGE
DEATH WOULD CERTAINLY SCREEN ME BOTH FROM
BAD LAWS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES
VOLUNTARY DEATH FRANCES
NO MONSIEUR
I'D HAVE COURAGE TO LIVE OUT EVERY THROE OF ANGUISH FATE
ASSIGNED ME AND PRINCIPLE TO CONTEND FOR JUSTICE AND LIBERTY TO THE
LAST
I SEE YOU WOULD HAVE MADE NO PATIENT GRIZZLE
AND NOW SUPPOSING FATE
HAD MERELY ASSIGNED YOU THE LOT OF AN OLD MAID WHAT THEN HOW WOULD YOU
HAVE LIKED CELIBACY
NOT MUCH CERTAINLY
AN OLD MAID'S LIFE MUST DOUBTLESS BE VOID AND
VAPID HER HEART STRAINED AND EMPTY
HAD I BEEN AN OLD MAID I SHOULD
HAVE SPENT EXISTENCE IN EFFORTS TO FILL THE VOID AND EASE THE ACHING
I
SHOULD HAVE PROBABLY FAILED AND DIED WEARY AND DISAPPOINTED DESPISED
AND OF NO ACCOUNT LIKE OTHER SINGLE WOMEN
BUT I'M NOT AN OLD MAID
SHE ADDED QUICKLY
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THOUGH BUT FOR MY MASTER
I
SHOULD NEVER HAVE SUITED ANY MAN BUT PROFESSOR CRIMSWORTH NO OTHER
GENTLEMAN FRENCH ENGLISH OR BELGIAN WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ME AMIABLE OR
HANDSOME AND I DOUBT WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE CARED FOR THE APPROBATION
OF MANY OTHERS IF I COULD HAVE OBTAINED IT
NOW I HAVE BEEN PROFESSOR
CRIMSWORTH'S WIFE EIGHT YEARS AND WHAT IS HE IN MY EYES IS HE
HONOURABLE BELOVED SHE STOPPED HER VOICE WAS CUT OFF HER EYES
SUDDENLY SUFFUSED
SHE AND I WERE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE SHE THREW HER
ARMS ROUND ME AND STRAINED ME TO HER HEART WITH PASSIONATE EARNESTNESS
THE ENERGY OF HER WHOLE BEING GLOWED IN HER DARK AND THEN DILATED
EYE AND CRIMSONED HER ANIMATED CHEEK HER LOOK AND MOVEMENT WERE LIKE
INSPIRATION IN ONE THERE WAS SUCH A FLASH IN THE OTHER SUCH A POWER
HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE HAD BECOME CALM I ASKED WHERE ALL
THAT WILD VIGOUR WAS GONE WHICH HAD TRANSFORMED HER ERE WHILE AND MADE
HER GLANCE SO THRILLING AND ARDENT HER ACTION SO RAPID AND STRONG
SHE
LOOKED DOWN SMILING SOFTLY AND PASSIVELY
I CANNOT TELL WHERE IT IS GONE MONSIEUR SAID SHE BUT I KNOW THAT
WHENEVER IT IS WANTED IT WILL COME BACK AGAIN
BEHOLD US NOW AT THE CLOSE OF THE TEN YEARS AND WE HAVE REALIZED AN
INDEPENDENCY
THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH WE ATTAINED THIS END HAD ITS
ORIGIN IN THREE REASONS FIRSTLY WE WORKED SO HARD FOR IT SECONDLY
WE HAD NO INCUMBRANCES TO DELAY SUCCESS THIRDLY AS SOON AS WE HAD
CAPITAL TO INVEST TWO WELL SKILLED COUNSELLORS ONE IN BELGIUM ONE IN
ENGLAND VIZ
VANDENHUTEN AND HUNSDEN GAVE US EACH A WORD OF ADVICE
AS TO THE SORT OF INVESTMENT TO BE CHOSEN
THE SUGGESTION MADE WAS
JUDICIOUS AND BEING PROMPTLY ACTED ON THE RESULT PROVED GAINFUL I
NEED NOT SAY HOW GAINFUL I COMMUNICATED DETAILS TO MESSRS
VANDENHUTEN
AND HUNSDEN NOBODY ELSE CAN BE INTERESTED IN HEARING THEM
ACCOUNTS BEING WOUND UP AND OUR PROFESSIONAL CONNECTION DISPOSED OF WE
BOTH AGREED THAT AS MAMMON WAS NOT OUR MASTER NOR HIS SERVICE THAT IN
WHICH WE DESIRED TO SPEND OUR LIVES AS OUR DESIRES WERE TEMPERATE AND
OUR HABITS UNOSTENTATIOUS WE HAD NOW ABUNDANCE TO LIVE ON ABUNDANCE TO
LEAVE OUR BOY AND SHOULD BESIDES ALWAYS HAVE A BALANCE ON HAND WHICH
PROPERLY MANAGED BY RIGHT SYMPATHY AND UNSELFISH ACTIVITY MIGHT
HELP PHILANTHROPY IN HER ENTERPRISES AND PUT SOLACE INTO THE HAND OF
CHARITY
TO ENGLAND WE NOW RESOLVED TO TAKE WING WE ARRIVED THERE SAFELY
FRANCES REALIZED THE DREAM OF HER LIFETIME
WE SPENT A WHOLE SUMMER
AND AUTUMN IN TRAVELLING FROM END TO END OF THE BRITISH ISLANDS AND
AFTERWARDS PASSED A WINTER IN LONDON
THEN WE THOUGHT IT HIGH TIME
TO FIX OUR RESIDENCE
MY HEART YEARNED TOWARDS MY NATIVE COUNTY OF
SHIRE AND IT IS IN SHIRE I NOW LIVE IT IS IN THE LIBRARY OF MY
OWN HOME I AM NOW WRITING
THAT HOME LIES AMID A SEQUESTERED AND RATHER
HILLY REGION THIRTY MILES REMOVED FROM X A REGION WHOSE VERDURE
THE SMOKE OF MILLS HAS NOT YET SULLIED WHOSE WATERS STILL RUN PURE
WHOSE SWELLS OF MOORLAND PRESERVE IN SOME FERNY GLENS THAT LIE BETWEEN
THEM THE VERY PRIMAL WILDNESS OF NATURE HER MOSS HER BRACKEN HER
BLUE BELLS HER SCENTS OF REED AND HEATHER HER FREE AND FRESH BREEZES
MY HOUSE IS A PICTURESQUE AND NOT TOO SPACIOUS DWELLING WITH LOW AND
LONG WINDOWS A TRELLISED AND LEAF VEILED PORCH OVER THE FRONT DOOR
JUST NOW ON THIS SUMMER EVENING LOOKING LIKE AN ARCH OF ROSES AND IVY
THE GARDEN IS CHIEFLY LAID OUT IN LAWN FORMED OF THE SOD OF THE HILLS
WITH HERBAGE SHORT AND SOFT AS MOSS FULL OF ITS OWN PECULIAR FLOWERS
TINY AND STARLIKE IMBEDDED IN THE MINUTE EMBROIDERY OF THEIR FINE
FOLIAGE
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOPING GARDEN THERE IS A WICKET WHICH
OPENS UPON A LANE AS GREEN AS THE LAWN VERY LONG SHADY AND LITTLE
FREQUENTED ON THE TURF OF THIS LANE GENERALLY APPEAR THE FIRST DAISIES
OF SPRING WHENCE ITS NAME DAISY LANE SERVING ALSO AS A DISTINCTION TO
THE HOUSE
IT TERMINATES THE LANE I MEAN IN A VALLEY FULL OF WOOD WHICH
WOOD CHIEFLY OAK AND BEECH SPREADS SHADOWY ABOUT THE VICINAGE OF A
VERY OLD MANSION ONE OF THE ELIZABETHAN STRUCTURES MUCH LARGER AS
WELL AS MORE ANTIQUE THAN DAISY LANE THE PROPERTY AND RESIDENCE OF
AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILIAR BOTH TO ME AND TO THE READER
YES IN HUNSDEN
WOOD FOR SO ARE THOSE GLADES AND THAT GREY BUILDING WITH MANY GABLES
AND MORE CHIMNEYS NAMED ABIDES YORKE HUNSDEN STILL UNMARRIED NEVER
I SUPPOSE HAVING YET FOUND HIS IDEAL THOUGH I KNOW AT LEAST A SCORE
OF YOUNG LADIES WITHIN A CIRCUIT OF FORTY MILES WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO
ASSIST HIM IN THE SEARCH
THE ESTATE FELL TO HIM BY THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER FIVE YEARS SINCE HE
HAS GIVEN UP TRADE AFTER HAVING MADE BY IT SUFFICIENT TO PAY OFF SOME
INCUMBRANCES BY WHICH THE FAMILY HERITAGE WAS BURDENED
I SAY HE ABIDES
HERE BUT I DO NOT THINK HE IS RESIDENT ABOVE FIVE MONTHS OUT OF THE
TWELVE HE WANDERS FROM LAND TO LAND AND SPENDS SOME PART OF EACH
WINTER IN TOWN HE FREQUENTLY BRINGS VISITORS WITH HIM WHEN HE COMES TO
SHIRE AND THESE VISITORS ARE OFTEN FOREIGNERS SOMETIMES HE HAS
A GERMAN METAPHYSICIAN SOMETIMES A FRENCH SAVANT HE HAD ONCE A
DISSATISFIED AND SAVAGE LOOKING ITALIAN WHO NEITHER SANG NOR PLAYED
AND OF WHOM FRANCES AFFIRMED THAT HE HAD TOUT L'AIR D'UN CONSPIRATEUR
WHAT ENGLISH GUESTS HUNSDEN INVITES ARE ALL EITHER MEN OF BIRMINGHAM OR
MANCHESTER HARD MEN SEEMINGLY KNIT UP IN ONE THOUGHT WHOSE TALK IS
OF FREE TRADE
THE FOREIGN VISITORS TOO ARE POLITICIANS THEY TAKE A
WIDER THEME EUROPEAN PROGRESS THE SPREAD OF LIBERAL SENTIMENTS OVER
THE CONTINENT ON THEIR MENTAL TABLETS THE NAMES OF RUSSIA AUSTRIA
AND THE POPE ARE INSCRIBED IN RED INK
I HAVE HEARD SOME OF THEM TALK
VIGOROUS SENSE YEA I HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT POLYGLOT DISCUSSIONS IN THE
OLD OAK LINED DINING ROOM AT HUNSDEN WOOD WHERE A SINGULAR INSIGHT
WAS GIVEN OF THE SENTIMENTS ENTERTAINED BY RESOLUTE MINDS RESPECTING OLD
NORTHERN DESPOTISMS AND OLD SOUTHERN SUPERSTITIONS ALSO I HAVE HEARD
MUCH TWADDLE ENOUNCED CHIEFLY IN FRENCH AND DEUTSCH BUT LET THAT PASS
HUNSDEN HIMSELF TOLERATED THE DRIVELLING THEORISTS WITH THE PRACTICAL
MEN HE SEEMED LEAGUED HAND AND HEART
WHEN HUNSDEN IS STAYING ALONE AT THE WOOD WHICH SELDOM HAPPENS HE
GENERALLY FINDS HIS WAY TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK TO DAISY LANE
HE HAS
A PHILANTHROPIC MOTIVE FOR COMING TO SMOKE HIS CIGAR IN OUR PORCH ON
SUMMER EVENINGS HE SAYS HE DOES IT TO KILL THE EARWIGS AMONGST THE
ROSES WITH WHICH INSECTS BUT FOR HIS BENEVOLENT FUMIGATIONS HE
INTIMATES WE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE OVERRUN
ON WET DAYS TOO WE ARE
ALMOST SURE TO SEE HIM ACCORDING TO HIM IT GETS ON TIME TO WORK
ME INTO LUNACY BY TREADING ON MY MENTAL CORNS OR TO FORCE FROM MRS
CRIMSWORTH REVELATIONS OF THE DRAGON WITHIN HER BY INSULTING THE MEMORY
OF HOFER AND TELL
WE ALSO GO FREQUENTLY TO HUNSDEN WOOD AND BOTH I AND FRANCES RELISH A
VISIT THERE HIGHLY
IF THERE ARE OTHER GUESTS THEIR CHARACTERS ARE
AN INTERESTING STUDY THEIR CONVERSATION IS EXCITING AND STRANGE THE
ABSENCE OF ALL LOCAL NARROWNESS BOTH IN THE HOST AND HIS CHOSEN SOCIETY
GIVES A METROPOLITAN ALMOST A COSMOPOLITAN FREEDOM AND LARGENESS TO THE
TALK
HUNSDEN HIMSELF IS A POLITE MAN IN HIS OWN HOUSE HE HAS WHEN HE
CHOOSES TO EMPLOY IT AN INEXHAUSTIBLE POWER OF ENTERTAINING GUESTS HIS
VERY MANSION TOO IS INTERESTING THE ROOMS LOOK STORIED THE
PASSAGES LEGENDARY THE LOW CEILED CHAMBERS WITH THEIR LONG ROWS OF
DIAMOND PANED LATTICES HAVE AN OLD WORLD HAUNTED AIR IN HIS TRAVELS
HE HAS COLLECTED STORES OF ARTICLES OF VERTU WHICH ARE WELL AND
TASTEFULLY DISPOSED IN HIS PANELLED OR TAPESTRIED ROOMS I HAVE SEEN
THERE ONE OR TWO PICTURES AND ONE OR TWO PIECES OF STATUARY WHICH MANY
AN ARISTOCRATIC CONNOISSEUR MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
WHEN I AND FRANCES HAVE DINED AND SPENT AN EVENING WITH HUNSDEN HE
OFTEN WALKS HOME WITH US
HIS WOOD IS LARGE AND SOME OF THE TIMBER
IS OLD AND OF HUGE GROWTH
THERE ARE WINDING WAYS IN IT WHICH PURSUED
THROUGH GLADE AND BRAKE MAKE THE WALK BACK TO DAISY LANE A SOMEWHAT
LONG ONE
MANY A TIME WHEN WE HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF A FULL MOON
AND WHEN THE NIGHT HAS BEEN MILD AND BALMY WHEN MOREOVER A CERTAIN
NIGHTINGALE HAS BEEN SINGING AND A CERTAIN STREAM HID IN ALDERS HAS
LENT THE SONG A SOFT ACCOMPANIMENT THE REMOTE CHURCH BELL OF THE ONE
HAMLET IN A DISTRICT OF TEN MILES HAS TOLLED MIDNIGHT ERE THE LORD OF
THE WOOD LEFT US AT OUR PORCH
FREE FLOWING WAS HIS TALK AT SUCH HOURS
AND FAR MORE QUIET AND GENTLE THAN IN THE DAY TIME AND BEFORE NUMBERS
HE WOULD THEN FORGET POLITICS AND DISCUSSION AND WOULD DWELL ON THE
PAST TIMES OF HIS HOUSE ON HIS FAMILY HISTORY ON HIMSELF AND HIS OWN
FEELINGS SUBJECTS EACH AND ALL INVESTED WITH A PECULIAR ZEST FOR THEY
WERE EACH AND ALL UNIQUE
ONE GLORIOUS NIGHT IN JUNE AFTER I HAD BEEN
TAUNTING HIM ABOUT HIS IDEAL BRIDE AND ASKING HIM WHEN SHE WOULD
COME AND GRAFT HER FOREIGN BEAUTY ON THE OLD HUNSDEN OAK HE ANSWERED
SUDDENLY
YOU CALL HER IDEAL BUT SEE HERE IS HER SHADOW AND THERE CANNOT BE A
SHADOW WITHOUT A SUBSTANCE
HE HAD LED US FROM THE DEPTH OF THE WINDING WAY INTO A GLADE FROM
WHENCE THE BEECHES WITHDREW LEAVING IT OPEN TO THE SKY AN UNCLOUDED
MOON POURED HER LIGHT INTO THIS GLADE AND HUNSDEN HELD OUT UNDER HER
BEAM AN IVORY MINIATURE
FRANCES WITH EAGERNESS EXAMINED IT FIRST THEN SHE GAVE IT TO
ME STILL HOWEVER PUSHING HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO MINE AND SEEKING
IN MY EYES WHAT I THOUGHT OF THE PORTRAIT
I THOUGHT IT REPRESENTED A
VERY HANDSOME AND VERY INDIVIDUAL LOOKING FEMALE FACE WITH AS HE HAD
ONCE SAID STRAIGHT AND HARMONIOUS FEATURES IT WAS DARK THE HAIR
RAVEN BLACK SWEPT NOT ONLY FROM THE BROW BUT FROM THE TEMPLES SEEMED
THRUST AWAY CARELESSLY AS IF SUCH BEAUTY DISPENSED WITH NAY
DESPISED ARRANGEMENT
THE ITALIAN EYE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO YOU AND AN
INDEPENDENT DETERMINED EYE IT WAS THE MOUTH WAS AS FIRM AS FINE THE
CHIN DITTO
ON THE BACK OF THE MINIATURE WAS GILDED LUCIA
THAT IS A REAL HEAD WAS MY CONCLUSION
HUNSDEN SMILED
I THINK SO HE REPLIED
ALL WAS REAL IN LUCIA
AND SHE WAS SOMEBODY YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED TO MARRY BUT COULD NOT
I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE LIKED TO MARRY HER AND THAT I HAVE NOT DONE SO
IS A PROOF THAT I COULD NOT
HE REPOSSESSED HIMSELF OF THE MINIATURE NOW AGAIN IN FRANCES' HAND AND
PUT IT AWAY
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT HE ASKED OF MY WIFE AS HE BUTTONED HIS COAT
OVER IT
I AM SURE LUCIA ONCE WORE CHAINS AND BROKE THEM WAS THE STRANGE
ANSWER
I DO NOT MEAN MATRIMONIAL CHAINS SHE ADDED CORRECTING
HERSELF AS IF SHE FEARED MIS INTERPRETATION BUT SOCIAL CHAINS OF SOME
SORT
THE FACE IS THAT OF ONE WHO HAS MADE AN EFFORT AND A SUCCESSFUL
AND TRIUMPHANT EFFORT TO WREST SOME VIGOROUS AND VALUED FACULTY FROM
INSUPPORTABLE CONSTRAINT AND WHEN LUCIA'S FACULTY GOT FREE I AM
CERTAIN IT SPREAD WIDE PINIONS AND CARRIED HER HIGHER THAN SHE
HESITATED
THAN WHAT DEMANDED HUNSDEN
THAN 'LES CONVENANCES' PERMITTED YOU TO FOLLOW
I THINK YOU GROW SPITEFUL IMPERTINENT
LUCIA HAS TRODDEN THE STAGE CONTINUED FRANCES
YOU NEVER SERIOUSLY
THOUGHT OF MARRYING HER YOU ADMIRED HER ORIGINALITY HER FEARLESSNESS
HER ENERGY OF BODY AND MIND YOU DELIGHTED IN HER TALENT WHATEVER THAT
WAS WHETHER SONG DANCE OR DRAMATIC REPRESENTATION YOU WORSHIPPED HER
BEAUTY WHICH WAS OF THE SORT AFTER YOUR OWN HEART BUT I AM SURE SHE
FILLED A SPHERE FROM WHENCE YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF TAKING A
WIFE
INGENIOUS REMARKED HUNSDEN WHETHER TRUE OR NOT IS ANOTHER QUESTION
MEANTIME DON'T YOU FEEL YOUR LITTLE LAMP OF A SPIRIT WAX VERY PALE
BESIDE SUCH A GIRANDOLE AS LUCIA'S
YES
CANDID AT LEAST AND THE PROFESSOR WILL SOON BE DISSATISFIED WITH THE
DIM LIGHT YOU GIVE
WILL YOU MONSIEUR
MY SIGHT WAS ALWAYS TOO WEAK TO ENDURE A BLAZE FRANCES AND WE HAD
NOW REACHED THE WICKET
I SAID A FEW PAGES BACK THAT THIS IS A SWEET SUMMER EVENING IT
IS THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF LOVELY DAYS AND THIS IS THE LOVELIEST
THE HAY IS JUST CARRIED FROM MY FIELDS ITS PERFUME STILL LINGERS IN THE
AIR
FRANCES PROPOSED TO ME AN HOUR OR TWO SINCE TO TAKE TEA OUT
ON THE LAWN I SEE THE ROUND TABLE LOADED WITH CHINA PLACED UNDER A
CERTAIN BEECH HUNSDEN IS EXPECTED NAY I HEAR HE IS COME THERE IS HIS
VOICE LAYING DOWN THE LAW ON SOME POINT WITH AUTHORITY THAT OF FRANCES
REPLIES SHE OPPOSES HIM OF COURSE
THEY ARE DISPUTING ABOUT VICTOR
OF WHOM HUNSDEN AFFIRMS THAT HIS MOTHER IS MAKING A MILKSOP
MRS
CRIMSWORTH RETALIATES
BETTER A THOUSAND TIMES HE SHOULD BE A MILKSOP THAN WHAT HE HUNSDEN
CALLS 'A FINE LAD AND MOREOVER SHE SAYS THAT IF HUNSDEN WERE TO BECOME
A FIXTURE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND WERE NOT A MERE COMET COMING AND
GOING NO ONE KNOWS HOW WHEN WHERE OR WHY SHE SHOULD BE QUITE UNEASY
TILL SHE HAD GOT VICTOR AWAY TO A SCHOOL AT LEAST A HUNDRED MILES OFF
FOR THAT WITH HIS MUTINOUS MAXIMS AND UNPRACTICAL DOGMAS HE WOULD RUIN
A SCORE OF CHILDREN
I HAVE A WORD TO SAY OF VICTOR ERE I SHUT THIS MANUSCRIPT IN MY
DESK BUT IT MUST BE A BRIEF ONE FOR I HEAR THE TINKLE OF SILVER ON
PORCELAIN
VICTOR IS AS LITTLE OF A PRETTY CHILD AS I AM OF A HANDSOME MAN OR HIS
MOTHER OF A FINE WOMAN HE IS PALE AND SPARE WITH LARGE EYES AS DARK
AS THOSE OF FRANCES AND AS DEEPLY SET AS MINE
HIS SHAPE IS SYMMETRICAL
ENOUGH BUT SLIGHT HIS HEALTH IS GOOD
I NEVER SAW A CHILD SMILE LESS
THAN HE DOES NOR ONE WHO KNITS SUCH A FORMIDABLE BROW WHEN SITTING OVER
A BOOK THAT INTERESTS HIM OR WHILE LISTENING TO TALES OF ADVENTURE
PERIL OR WONDER NARRATED BY HIS MOTHER HUNSDEN OR MYSELF
BUT
THOUGH STILL HE IS NOT UNHAPPY THOUGH SERIOUS NOT MOROSE HE HAS A
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PLEASURABLE SENSATIONS ALMOST TOO KEEN FOR IT AMOUNTS
TO ENTHUSIASM
HE LEARNED TO READ IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY OUT OF A
SPELLING BOOK AT HIS MOTHER'S KNEE AND AS HE GOT ON WITHOUT DRIVING BY
THAT METHOD SHE THOUGHT IT UNNECESSARY TO BUY HIM IVORY LETTERS OR TO
TRY ANY OF THE OTHER INDUCEMENTS TO LEARNING NOW DEEMED INDISPENSABLE
WHEN HE COULD READ HE BECAME A GLUTTON OF BOOKS AND IS SO STILL
HIS TOYS HAVE BEEN FEW AND HE HAS NEVER WANTED MORE
FOR THOSE HE
POSSESSES HE SEEMS TO HAVE CONTRACTED A PARTIALITY AMOUNTING TO
AFFECTION THIS FEELING DIRECTED TOWARDS ONE OR TWO LIVING ANIMALS OF
THE HOUSE STRENGTHENS ALMOST TO A PASSION
MR
HUNSDEN GAVE HIM A MASTIFF CUB WHICH HE CALLED YORKE AFTER THE
DONOR IT GREW TO A SUPERB DOG WHOSE FIERCENESS HOWEVER WAS MUCH
MODIFIED BY THE COMPANIONSHIP AND CARESSES OF ITS YOUNG MASTER
HE WOULD
GO NOWHERE DO NOTHING WITHOUT YORKE YORKE LAY AT HIS FEET WHILE HE
LEARNED HIS LESSONS PLAYED WITH HIM IN THE GARDEN WALKED WITH HIM IN
THE LANE AND WOOD SAT NEAR HIS CHAIR AT MEALS WAS FED ALWAYS BY HIS
OWN HAND WAS THE FIRST THING HE SOUGHT IN THE MORNING THE LAST HE LEFT
AT NIGHT
YORKE ACCOMPANIED MR
HUNSDEN ONE DAY TO X AND WAS BITTEN
IN THE STREET BY A DOG IN A RABID STATE
AS SOON AS HUNSDEN HAD BROUGHT
HIM HOME AND HAD INFORMED ME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE I WENT INTO THE YARD
AND SHOT HIM WHERE HE LAY LICKING HIS WOUND HE WAS DEAD IN AN INSTANT
HE HAD NOT SEEN ME LEVEL THE GUN I STOOD BEHIND HIM
I HAD SCARCELY
BEEN TEN MINUTES IN THE HOUSE WHEN MY EAR WAS STRUCK WITH SOUNDS OF
ANGUISH I REPAIRED TO THE YARD ONCE MORE FOR THEY PROCEEDED THENCE
VICTOR WAS KNEELING BESIDE HIS DEAD MASTIFF BENT OVER IT EMBRACING ITS
BULL LIKE NECK AND LOST IN A PASSION OF THE WILDEST WOE HE SAW ME
OH PAPA I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU WAS HIS
EXCLAMATION
YOU SHOT YORKE I SAW IT FROM THE WINDOW
I NEVER BELIEVED
YOU COULD BE SO CRUEL I CAN LOVE YOU NO MORE
I HAD MUCH ADO TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WITH A STEADY VOICE THE STERN
NECESSITY OF THE DEED HE STILL WITH THAT INCONSOLABLE AND BITTER
ACCENT WHICH I CANNOT RENDER BUT WHICH PIERCED MY HEART REPEATED
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CURED YOU SHOULD HAVE TRIED YOU SHOULD HAVE BURNT
THE WOUND WITH A HOT IRON OR COVERED IT WITH CAUSTIC
YOU GAVE NO TIME
AND NOW IT IS TOO LATE HE IS DEAD
HE SANK FAIRLY DOWN ON THE SENSELESS CARCASE I WAITED PATIENTLY A LONG
WHILE TILL HIS GRIEF HAD SOMEWHAT EXHAUSTED HIM AND THEN I LIFTED HIM
IN MY ARMS AND CARRIED HIM TO HIS MOTHER SURE THAT SHE WOULD COMFORT
HIM BEST
SHE HAD WITNESSED THE WHOLE SCENE FROM A WINDOW SHE WOULD NOT
COME OUT FOR FEAR OF INCREASING MY DIFFICULTIES BY HER EMOTION BUT SHE
WAS READY NOW TO RECEIVE HIM
SHE TOOK HIM TO HER KIND HEART AND ON
TO HER GENTLE LAP CONSOLED HIM BUT WITH HER LIPS HER EYES HER SOFT
EMBRACE FOR SOME TIME AND THEN WHEN HIS SOBS DIMINISHED TOLD HIM
THAT YORKE HAD FELT NO PAIN IN DYING AND THAT IF HE HAD BEEN LEFT TO
EXPIRE NATURALLY HIS END WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST HORRIBLE ABOVE ALL SHE
TOLD HIM THAT I WAS NOT CRUEL FOR THAT IDEA SEEMED TO GIVE EXQUISITE
PAIN TO POOR VICTOR THAT IT WAS MY AFFECTION FOR YORKE AND HIM WHICH
HAD MADE ME ACT SO AND THAT I WAS NOW ALMOST HEART BROKEN TO SEE HIM
WEEP THUS BITTERLY
VICTOR WOULD HAVE BEEN NO TRUE SON OF HIS FATHER HAD THESE
CONSIDERATIONS THESE REASONS BREATHED IN SO LOW SO SWEET A
TONE MARRIED TO CARESSES SO BENIGN SO TENDER TO LOOKS SO INSPIRED
WITH PITYING SYMPATHY PRODUCED NO EFFECT ON HIM
THEY DID PRODUCE AN
EFFECT HE GREW CALMER RESTED HIS FACE ON HER SHOULDER AND LAY STILL
IN HER ARMS
LOOKING UP SHORTLY HE ASKED HIS MOTHER TO TELL HIM OVER
AGAIN WHAT SHE HAD SAID ABOUT YORKE HAVING SUFFERED NO PAIN AND MY NOT
BEING CRUEL THE BALMY WORDS BEING REPEATED HE AGAIN PILLOWED HIS CHEEK
ON HER BREAST AND WAS AGAIN TRANQUIL
SOME HOURS AFTER HE CAME TO ME IN MY LIBRARY ASKED IF I FORGAVE HIM
AND DESIRED TO BE RECONCILED
I DREW THE LAD TO MY SIDE AND THERE I
KEPT HIM A GOOD WHILE AND HAD MUCH TALK WITH HIM IN THE COURSE OF
WHICH HE DISCLOSED MANY POINTS OF FEELING AND THOUGHT I APPROVED OF IN
MY SON
I FOUND IT IS TRUE FEW ELEMENTS OF THE GOOD FELLOW OR THE
FINE FELLOW IN HIM SCANT SPARKLES OF THE SPIRIT WHICH LOVES TO FLASH
OVER THE WINE CUP OR WHICH KINDLES THE PASSIONS TO A DESTROYING
FIRE BUT I SAW IN THE SOIL OF HIS HEART HEALTHY AND SWELLING GERMS
OF COMPASSION AFFECTION FIDELITY
I DISCOVERED IN THE GARDEN OF HIS
INTELLECT A RICH GROWTH OF WHOLESOME PRINCIPLES REASON JUSTICE MORAL
COURAGE PROMISED IF NOT BLIGHTED A FERTILE BEARING
SO I BESTOWED ON
HIS LARGE FOREHEAD AND ON HIS CHEEK STILL PALE WITH TEARS A PROUD AND
CONTENTED KISS AND SENT HIM AWAY COMFORTED
YET I SAW HIM THE NEXT DAY
LAID ON THE MOUND UNDER WHICH YORKE HAD BEEN BURIED HIS FACE COVERED
WITH HIS HANDS HE WAS MELANCHOLY FOR SOME WEEKS AND MORE THAN A YEAR
ELAPSED BEFORE HE WOULD LISTEN TO ANY PROPOSAL OF HAVING ANOTHER DOG
VICTOR LEARNS FAST
HE MUST SOON GO TO ETON WHERE I SUSPECT HIS FIRST
YEAR OR TWO WILL BE UTTER WRETCHEDNESS TO LEAVE ME HIS MOTHER AND HIS
HOME WILL GIVE HIS HEART AN AGONIZED WRENCH THEN THE FAGGING WILL NOT
SUIT HIM BUT EMULATION THIRST AFTER KNOWLEDGE THE GLORY OF SUCCESS
WILL STIR AND REWARD HIM IN TIME
MEANTIME I FEEL IN MYSELF A STRONG
REPUGNANCE TO FIX THE HOUR WHICH WILL UPROOT MY SOLE OLIVE BRANCH AND
TRANSPLANT IT FAR FROM ME AND WHEN I SPEAK TO FRANCES ON THE SUBJECT
I AM HEARD WITH A KIND OF PATIENT PAIN AS THOUGH I ALLUDED TO SOME
FEARFUL OPERATION AT WHICH HER NATURE SHUDDERS BUT FROM WHICH HER
FORTITUDE WILL NOT PERMIT HER TO RECOIL
THE STEP MUST HOWEVER BE
TAKEN AND IT SHALL BE FOR THOUGH FRANCES WILL NOT MAKE A MILKSOP OF
HER SON SHE WILL ACCUSTOM HIM TO A STYLE OF TREATMENT A FORBEARANCE
A CONGENIAL TENDERNESS HE WILL MEET WITH FROM NONE ELSE
SHE SEES AS
I ALSO SEE A SOMETHING IN VICTOR'S TEMPER A KIND OF ELECTRICAL ARDOUR
AND POWER WHICH EMITS NOW AND THEN OMINOUS SPARKS HUNSDEN CALLS IT
HIS SPIRIT AND SAYS IT SHOULD NOT BE CURBED
I CALL IT THE LEAVEN OF
THE OFFENDING ADAM AND CONSIDER THAT IT SHOULD BE IF NOT WHIPPED OUT
OF HIM AT LEAST SOUNDLY DISCIPLINED AND THAT HE WILL BE CHEAP OF
ANY AMOUNT OF EITHER BODILY OR MENTAL SUFFERING WHICH WILL GROUND HIM
RADICALLY IN THE ART OF SELF CONTROL
FRANCES GIVES THIS SOMETHING IN
HER SON'S MARKED CHARACTER NO NAME BUT WHEN IT APPEARS IN THE GRINDING
OF HIS TEETH IN THE GLITTERING OF HIS EYE IN THE FIERCE REVOLT OF
FEELING AGAINST DISAPPOINTMENT MISCHANCE SUDDEN SORROW OR SUPPOSED
INJUSTICE SHE FOLDS HIM TO HER BREAST OR TAKES HIM TO WALK WITH HER
ALONE IN THE WOOD THEN SHE REASONS WITH HIM LIKE ANY PHILOSOPHER AND
TO REASON VICTOR IS EVER ACCESSIBLE THEN SHE LOOKS AT HIM WITH EYES OF
LOVE AND BY LOVE VICTOR CAN BE INFALLIBLY SUBJUGATED BUT WILL REASON
OR LOVE BE THE WEAPONS WITH WHICH IN FUTURE THE WORLD WILL MEET HIS
VIOLENCE OH NO FOR THAT FLASH IN HIS BLACK EYE FOR THAT CLOUD ON
HIS BONY BROW FOR THAT COMPRESSION OF HIS STATUESQUE LIPS THE LAD WILL
SOME DAY GET BLOWS INSTEAD OF BLANDISHMENTS KICKS INSTEAD OF KISSES
THEN FOR THE FIT OF MUTE FURY WHICH WILL SICKEN HIS BODY AND MADDEN
HIS SOUL THEN FOR THE ORDEAL OF MERITED AND SALUTARY SUFFERING OUT OF
WHICH HE WILL COME I TRUST A WISER AND A BETTER MAN
I SEE HIM NOW HE STANDS BY HUNSDEN WHO IS SEATED ON THE LAWN UNDER THE
BEECH HUNSDEN'S HAND RESTS ON THE BOY'S COLLAR AND HE IS INSTILLING
GOD KNOWS WHAT PRINCIPLES INTO HIS EAR
VICTOR LOOKS WELL JUST NOW FOR
HE LISTENS WITH A SORT OF SMILING INTEREST HE NEVER LOOKS SO LIKE HIS
MOTHER AS WHEN HE SMILES PITY THE SUNSHINE BREAKS OUT SO RARELY VICTOR
HAS A PREFERENCE FOR HUNSDEN FULL AS STRONG AS I DEEM DESIRABLE BEING
CONSIDERABLY MORE POTENT DECIDED AND INDISCRIMINATING THAN ANY I EVER
ENTERTAINED FOR THAT PERSONAGE MYSELF
FRANCES TOO REGARDS IT WITH A
SORT OF UNEXPRESSED ANXIETY WHILE HER SON LEANS ON HUNSDEN'S KNEE OR
RESTS AGAINST HIS SHOULDER SHE ROVES WITH RESTLESS MOVEMENT ROUND
LIKE A DOVE GUARDING ITS YOUNG FROM A HOVERING HAWK SHE SAYS SHE WISHES
HUNSDEN HAD CHILDREN OF HIS OWN FOR THEN HE WOULD BETTER KNOW THE
DANGER OF INCITING THEIR PRIDE END INDULGING THEIR FOIBLES
FRANCES APPROACHES MY LIBRARY WINDOW PUTS ASIDE THE HONEYSUCKLE WHICH
HALF COVERS IT AND TELLS ME TEA IS READY SEEING THAT I CONTINUE BUSY
SHE ENTERS THE ROOM COMES NEAR ME QUIETLY AND PUTS HER HAND ON MY
SHOULDER
MONSIEUR EST TROP APPLIQUE
I SHALL SOON HAVE DONE
SHE DRAWS A CHAIR NEAR AND SITS DOWN TO WAIT TILL I HAVE FINISHED HER
PRESENCE IS AS PLEASANT TO MY MIND AS THE PERFUME OF THE FRESH HAY AND
SPICY FLOWERS AS THE GLOW OF THE WESTERING SUN AS THE REPOSE OF THE
MIDSUMMER EVE ARE TO MY SENSES
BUT HUNSDEN COMES I HEAR HIS STEP AND THERE HE IS BENDING THROUGH THE
LATTICE FROM WHICH HE HAS THRUST AWAY THE WOODBINE WITH UNSPARING HAND
DISTURBING TWO BEES AND A BUTTERFLY
CRIMSWORTH I SAY CRIMSWORTH TAKE THAT PEN OUT OF HIS HAND MISTRESS
AND MAKE HIM LIFT UP HIS HEAD
WELL HUNSDEN I HEAR YOU
I WAS AT X YESTERDAY YOUR BROTHER NED IS GETTING RICHER THAN
CROESUS BY RAILWAY SPECULATIONS THEY CALL HIM IN THE PIECE HALL A STAG
OF TEN AND I HAVE HEARD FROM BROWN
M
AND MADAME VANDENHUTEN AND JEAN
BAPTISTE TALK OF COMING TO SEE YOU NEXT MONTH

TOO HE SAYS THEIR DOMESTIC HARMONY IS NOT THE FINEST IN THE WORLD BUT
IN BUSINESS THEY ARE DOING 'ON NE PEUT MIEUX WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE
HE CONCLUDES WILL BE A SUFFICIENT CONSOLATION TO BOTH FOR ANY LITTLE
CROSSES IN THE AFFECTIONS
WHY DON'T YOU INVITE THE PELETS TO SHIRE
CRIMSWORTH I SHOULD SO LIKE TO SEE YOUR FIRST FLAME ZORAIDE
MISTRESS
DON'T BE JEALOUS BUT HE LOVED THAT LADY TO DISTRACTION I KNOW IT FOR A
FACT
BROWN SAYS SHE WEIGHS TWELVE STONES NOW YOU SEE WHAT YOU'VE
LOST MR
PROFESSOR

PREFACE
A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF JANE EYRE BEING UNNECESSARY I GAVE
NONE THIS SECOND EDITION DEMANDS A FEW WORDS BOTH OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND
MISCELLANEOUS REMARK
MY THANKS ARE DUE IN THREE QUARTERS
TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE INDULGENT EAR IT HAS INCLINED TO A PLAIN TALE WITH
FEW PRETENSIONS
TO THE PRESS FOR THE FAIR FIELD ITS HONEST SUFFRAGE HAS OPENED TO AN
OBSCURE ASPIRANT
TO MY PUBLISHERS FOR THE AID THEIR TACT THEIR ENERGY THEIR PRACTICAL
SENSE AND FRANK LIBERALITY HAVE AFFORDED AN UNKNOWN AND UNRECOMMENDED
AUTHOR
THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC ARE BUT VAGUE PERSONIFICATIONS FOR ME AND I
MUST THANK THEM IN VAGUE TERMS BUT MY PUBLISHERS ARE DEFINITE SO ARE
CERTAIN GENEROUS CRITICS WHO HAVE ENCOURAGED ME AS ONLY LARGE HEARTED AND
HIGH MINDED MEN KNOW HOW TO ENCOURAGE A STRUGGLING STRANGER TO THEM
I E TO MY PUBLISHERS AND THE SELECT REVIEWERS I SAY CORDIALLY
GENTLEMEN I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART
HAVING THUS ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT I OWE THOSE WHO HAVE AIDED AND APPROVED ME
I TURN TO ANOTHER CLASS A SMALL ONE SO FAR AS I KNOW BUT NOT
THEREFORE TO BE OVERLOOKED
I MEAN THE TIMOROUS OR CARPING FEW WHO
DOUBT THE TENDENCY OF SUCH BOOKS AS JANE EYRE IN WHOSE EYES WHATEVER
IS UNUSUAL IS WRONG WHOSE EARS DETECT IN EACH PROTEST AGAINST
BIGOTRY THAT PARENT OF CRIME AN INSULT TO PIETY THAT REGENT OF GOD ON
EARTH
I WOULD SUGGEST TO SUCH DOUBTERS CERTAIN OBVIOUS DISTINCTIONS I
WOULD REMIND THEM OF CERTAIN SIMPLE TRUTHS
CONVENTIONALITY IS NOT MORALITY
SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT RELIGION
TO
ATTACK THE FIRST IS NOT TO ASSAIL THE LAST
TO PLUCK THE MASK FROM THE
FACE OF THE PHARISEE IS NOT TO LIFT AN IMPIOUS HAND TO THE CROWN OF
THORNS
THESE THINGS AND DEEDS ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED THEY ARE AS DISTINCT AS
IS VICE FROM VIRTUE
MEN TOO OFTEN CONFOUND THEM THEY SHOULD NOT BE
CONFOUNDED APPEARANCE SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR TRUTH NARROW HUMAN
DOCTRINES THAT ONLY TEND TO ELATE AND MAGNIFY A FEW SHOULD NOT BE
SUBSTITUTED FOR THE WORLD REDEEMING CREED OF CHRIST
THERE IS I REPEAT
IT A DIFFERENCE AND IT IS A GOOD AND NOT A BAD ACTION TO MARK BROADLY
AND CLEARLY THE LINE OF SEPARATION BETWEEN THEM
THE WORLD MAY NOT LIKE TO SEE THESE IDEAS DISSEVERED FOR IT HAS BEEN
ACCUSTOMED TO BLEND THEM FINDING IT CONVENIENT TO MAKE EXTERNAL SHOW
PASS FOR STERLING WORTH TO LET WHITE WASHED WALLS VOUCH FOR CLEAN
SHRINES
IT MAY HATE HIM WHO DARES TO SCRUTINISE AND EXPOSE TO RASE THE
GILDING AND SHOW BASE METAL UNDER IT TO PENETRATE THE SEPULCHRE AND
REVEAL CHARNEL RELICS BUT HATE AS IT WILL IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM
AHAB DID NOT LIKE MICAIAH BECAUSE HE NEVER PROPHESIED GOOD CONCERNING
HIM BUT EVIL PROBABLY HE LIKED THE SYCOPHANT SON OF CHENAANNAH BETTER
YET MIGHT AHAB HAVE ESCAPED A BLOODY DEATH HAD HE BUT STOPPED HIS EARS
TO FLATTERY AND OPENED THEM TO FAITHFUL COUNSEL
THERE IS A MAN IN OUR OWN DAYS WHOSE WORDS ARE NOT FRAMED TO TICKLE
DELICATE EARS WHO TO MY THINKING COMES BEFORE THE GREAT ONES OF
SOCIETY MUCH AS THE SON OF IMLAH CAME BEFORE THE THRONED KINGS OF JUDAH
AND ISRAEL AND WHO SPEAKS TRUTH AS DEEP WITH A POWER AS PROPHET LIKE
AND AS VITAL A MIEN AS DAUNTLESS AND AS DARING
IS THE SATIRIST OF
VANITY FAIR ADMIRED IN HIGH PLACES I CANNOT TELL BUT I THINK IF SOME
OF THOSE AMONGST WHOM HE HURLS THE GREEK FIRE OF HIS SARCASM AND OVER
WHOM HE FLASHES THE LEVIN BRAND OF HIS DENUNCIATION WERE TO TAKE HIS
WARNINGS IN TIME THEY OR THEIR SEED MIGHT YET ESCAPE A FATAL
RIMOTH GILEAD
WHY HAVE I ALLUDED TO THIS MAN I HAVE ALLUDED TO HIM READER BECAUSE I
THINK I SEE IN HIM AN INTELLECT PROFOUNDER AND MORE UNIQUE THAN HIS
CONTEMPORARIES HAVE YET RECOGNISED BECAUSE I REGARD HIM AS THE FIRST
SOCIAL REGENERATOR OF THE DAY AS THE VERY MASTER OF THAT WORKING CORPS
WHO WOULD RESTORE TO RECTITUDE THE WARPED SYSTEM OF THINGS BECAUSE I
THINK NO COMMENTATOR ON HIS WRITINGS HAS YET FOUND THE COMPARISON THAT
SUITS HIM THE TERMS WHICH RIGHTLY CHARACTERISE HIS TALENT
THEY SAY HE
IS LIKE FIELDING THEY TALK OF HIS WIT HUMOUR COMIC POWERS
HE
RESEMBLES FIELDING AS AN EAGLE DOES A VULTURE FIELDING COULD STOOP ON
CARRION BUT THACKERAY NEVER DOES
HIS WIT IS BRIGHT HIS HUMOUR
ATTRACTIVE BUT BOTH BEAR THE SAME RELATION TO HIS SERIOUS GENIUS THAT
THE MERE LAMBENT SHEET LIGHTNING PLAYING UNDER THE EDGE OF THE SUMMER
CLOUD DOES TO THE ELECTRIC DEATH SPARK HID IN ITS WOMB
FINALLY I HAVE
ALLUDED TO MR
THACKERAY BECAUSE TO HIM IF HE WILL ACCEPT THE TRIBUTE
OF A TOTAL STRANGER I HAVE DEDICATED THIS SECOND EDITION OF JANE EYRE
CURRER BELL
DECEMBER 21 ST 1847
NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
I AVAIL MYSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH A THIRD EDITION OF JANE EYRE
AFFORDS ME OF AGAIN ADDRESSING A WORD TO THE PUBLIC TO EXPLAIN THAT MY
CLAIM TO THE TITLE OF NOVELIST RESTS ON THIS ONE WORK ALONE
IF
THEREFORE THE AUTHORSHIP OF OTHER WORKS OF FICTION HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED
TO ME AN HONOUR IS AWARDED WHERE IT IS NOT MERITED AND CONSEQUENTLY
DENIED WHERE IT IS JUSTLY DUE
THIS EXPLANATION WILL SERVE TO RECTIFY MISTAKES WHICH MAY ALREADY HAVE
BEEN MADE AND TO PREVENT FUTURE ERRORS

CHAPTER I
THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY
WE HAD BEEN
WANDERING INDEED IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING BUT
SINCE DINNER MRS
REED WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY DINED EARLY THE COLD
WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT CLOUDS SO SOMBRE AND A RAIN SO
PENETRATING THAT FURTHER OUT DOOR EXERCISE WAS NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION
I WAS GLAD OF IT I NEVER LIKED LONG WALKS ESPECIALLY ON CHILLY
AFTERNOONS DREADFUL TO ME WAS THE COMING HOME IN THE RAW TWILIGHT WITH
NIPPED FINGERS AND TOES AND A HEART SADDENED BY THE CHIDINGS OF BESSIE
THE NURSE AND HUMBLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY PHYSICAL INFERIORITY TO
ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA REED
THE SAID ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA WERE NOW CLUSTERED ROUND THEIR MAMA
IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE LAY RECLINED ON A SOFA BY THE FIRESIDE AND WITH
HER DARLINGS ABOUT HER FOR THE TIME NEITHER QUARRELLING NOR CRYING
LOOKED PERFECTLY HAPPY
ME SHE HAD DISPENSED FROM JOINING THE GROUP
SAYING SHE REGRETTED TO BE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF KEEPING ME AT A
DISTANCE BUT THAT UNTIL SHE HEARD FROM BESSIE AND COULD DISCOVER BY HER
OWN OBSERVATION THAT I WAS ENDEAVOURING IN GOOD EARNEST TO ACQUIRE A
MORE SOCIABLE AND CHILDLIKE DISPOSITION A MORE ATTRACTIVE AND SPRIGHTLY
MANNER SOMETHING LIGHTER FRANKER MORE NATURAL AS IT WERE SHE REALLY
MUST EXCLUDE ME FROM PRIVILEGES INTENDED ONLY FOR CONTENTED HAPPY
LITTLE CHILDREN
WHAT DOES BESSIE SAY I HAVE DONE I ASKED
JANE I DON'T LIKE CAVILLERS OR QUESTIONERS BESIDES THERE IS SOMETHING
TRULY FORBIDDING IN A CHILD TAKING UP HER ELDERS IN THAT MANNER
BE
SEATED SOMEWHERE AND UNTIL YOU CAN SPEAK PLEASANTLY REMAIN SILENT
A BREAKFAST ROOM ADJOINED THE DRAWING ROOM I SLIPPED IN THERE
IT
CONTAINED A BOOKCASE I SOON POSSESSED MYSELF OF A VOLUME TAKING CARE
THAT IT SHOULD BE ONE STORED WITH PICTURES
I MOUNTED INTO THE WINDOW
SEAT GATHERING UP MY FEET I SAT CROSS LEGGED LIKE A TURK AND HAVING
DRAWN THE RED MOREEN CURTAIN NEARLY CLOSE I WAS SHRINED IN DOUBLE
RETIREMENT
FOLDS OF SCARLET DRAPERY SHUT IN MY VIEW TO THE RIGHT HAND TO THE LEFT
WERE THE CLEAR PANES OF GLASS PROTECTING BUT NOT SEPARATING ME FROM THE
DREAR NOVEMBER DAY
AT INTERVALS WHILE TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF MY
BOOK I STUDIED THE ASPECT OF THAT WINTER AFTERNOON
AFAR IT OFFERED A
PALE BLANK OF MIST AND CLOUD NEAR A SCENE OF WET LAWN AND STORM BEAT
SHRUB WITH CEASELESS RAIN SWEEPING AWAY WILDLY BEFORE A LONG AND
LAMENTABLE BLAST
I RETURNED TO MY BOOK BEWICK'S HISTORY OF BRITISH BIRDS THE LETTERPRESS
THEREOF I CARED LITTLE FOR GENERALLY SPEAKING AND YET THERE WERE
CERTAIN INTRODUCTORY PAGES THAT CHILD AS I WAS I COULD NOT PASS QUITE
AS A BLANK
THEY WERE THOSE WHICH TREAT OF THE HAUNTS OF SEA FOWL OF
THE SOLITARY ROCKS AND PROMONTORIES BY THEM ONLY INHABITED OF THE
COAST OF NORWAY STUDDED WITH ISLES FROM ITS SOUTHERN EXTREMITY THE
LINDENESS OR NAZE TO THE NORTH CAPE
WHERE THE NORTHERN OCEAN IN VAST WHIRLS
BOILS ROUND THE NAKED MELANCHOLY ISLES
OF FARTHEST THULE AND THE ATLANTIC SURGE
POURS IN AMONG THE STORMY HEBRIDES
NOR COULD I PASS UNNOTICED THE SUGGESTION OF THE BLEAK SHORES OF LAPLAND
SIBERIA SPITZBERGEN NOVA ZEMBLA ICELAND GREENLAND WITH THE VAST
SWEEP OF THE ARCTIC ZONE AND THOSE FORLORN REGIONS OF DREARY SPACE THAT
RESERVOIR OF FROST AND SNOW WHERE FIRM FIELDS OF ICE THE ACCUMULATION
OF CENTURIES OF WINTERS GLAZED IN ALPINE HEIGHTS ABOVE HEIGHTS SURROUND
THE POLE AND CONCENTRE THE MULTIPLIED RIGOURS OF EXTREME COLD OF
THESE DEATH WHITE REALMS I FORMED AN IDEA OF MY OWN SHADOWY LIKE ALL
THE HALF COMPREHENDED NOTIONS THAT FLOAT DIM THROUGH CHILDREN'S BRAINS
BUT STRANGELY IMPRESSIVE
THE WORDS IN THESE INTRODUCTORY PAGES
CONNECTED THEMSELVES WITH THE SUCCEEDING VIGNETTES AND GAVE SIGNIFICANCE
TO THE ROCK STANDING UP ALONE IN A SEA OF BILLOW AND SPRAY TO THE BROKEN
BOAT STRANDED ON A DESOLATE COAST TO THE COLD AND GHASTLY MOON GLANCING
THROUGH BARS OF CLOUD AT A WRECK JUST SINKING
I CANNOT TELL WHAT SENTIMENT HAUNTED THE QUITE SOLITARY CHURCHYARD WITH
ITS INSCRIBED HEADSTONE ITS GATE ITS TWO TREES ITS LOW HORIZON
GIRDLED BY A BROKEN WALL AND ITS NEWLY RISEN CRESCENT ATTESTING THE
HOUR OF EVENTIDE
THE TWO SHIPS BECALMED ON A TORPID SEA I BELIEVED TO BE MARINE PHANTOMS
THE FIEND PINNING DOWN THE THIEF'S PACK BEHIND HIM I PASSED OVER
QUICKLY IT WAS AN OBJECT OF TERROR
SO WAS THE BLACK HORNED THING SEATED ALOOF ON A ROCK SURVEYING A DISTANT
CROWD SURROUNDING A GALLOWS
EACH PICTURE TOLD A STORY MYSTERIOUS OFTEN TO MY UNDEVELOPED
UNDERSTANDING AND IMPERFECT FEELINGS YET EVER PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING AS
INTERESTING AS THE TALES BESSIE SOMETIMES NARRATED ON WINTER EVENINGS
WHEN SHE CHANCED TO BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AND WHEN HAVING BROUGHT HER
IRONING TABLE TO THE NURSERY HEARTH SHE ALLOWED US TO SIT ABOUT IT AND
WHILE SHE GOT UP MRS
REED'S LACE FRILLS AND CRIMPED HER NIGHTCAP
BORDERS FED OUR EAGER ATTENTION WITH PASSAGES OF LOVE AND ADVENTURE
TAKEN FROM OLD FAIRY TALES AND OTHER BALLADS OR AS AT A LATER PERIOD I
DISCOVERED FROM THE PAGES OF PAMELA AND HENRY EARL OF MORELAND
WITH BEWICK ON MY KNEE I WAS THEN HAPPY HAPPY AT LEAST IN MY WAY
I
FEARED NOTHING BUT INTERRUPTION AND THAT CAME TOO SOON
THE BREAKFAST
ROOM DOOR OPENED
BOH MADAM MOPE CRIED THE VOICE OF JOHN REED THEN HE PAUSED HE
FOUND THE ROOM APPARENTLY EMPTY
WHERE THE DICKENS IS SHE HE CONTINUED
LIZZY GEORGY CALLING TO
HIS SISTERS JOAN IS NOT HERE TELL MAMA SHE IS RUN OUT INTO THE RAIN BAD
ANIMAL
IT IS WELL I DREW THE CURTAIN THOUGHT I AND I WISHED FERVENTLY HE
MIGHT NOT DISCOVER MY HIDING PLACE NOR WOULD JOHN REED HAVE FOUND IT OUT
HIMSELF HE WAS NOT QUICK EITHER OF VISION OR CONCEPTION BUT ELIZA JUST
PUT HER HEAD IN AT THE DOOR AND SAID AT ONCE
SHE IS IN THE WINDOW SEAT TO BE SURE JACK
AND I CAME OUT IMMEDIATELY FOR I TREMBLED AT THE IDEA OF BEING DRAGGED
FORTH BY THE SAID JACK
WHAT DO YOU WANT I ASKED WITH AWKWARD DIFFIDENCE
SAY 'WHAT DO YOU WANT MASTER REED WAS THE ANSWER
I WANT YOU TO
COME HERE AND SEATING HIMSELF IN AN ARM CHAIR HE INTIMATED BY A
GESTURE THAT I WAS TO APPROACH AND STAND BEFORE HIM
JOHN REED WAS A SCHOOLBOY OF FOURTEEN YEARS OLD FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I
FOR I WAS BUT TEN LARGE AND STOUT FOR HIS AGE WITH A DINGY AND
UNWHOLESOME SKIN THICK LINEAMENTS IN A SPACIOUS VISAGE HEAVY LIMBS AND
LARGE EXTREMITIES
HE GORGED HIMSELF HABITUALLY AT TABLE WHICH MADE HIM
BILIOUS AND GAVE HIM A DIM AND BLEARED EYE AND FLABBY CHEEKS
HE OUGHT
NOW TO HAVE BEEN AT SCHOOL BUT HIS MAMA HAD TAKEN HIM HOME FOR A MONTH
OR TWO ON ACCOUNT OF HIS DELICATE HEALTH MR
MILES THE MASTER
AFFIRMED THAT HE WOULD DO VERY WELL IF HE HAD FEWER CAKES AND SWEETMEATS
SENT HIM FROM HOME BUT THE MOTHER'S HEART TURNED FROM AN OPINION SO
HARSH AND INCLINED RATHER TO THE MORE REFINED IDEA THAT JOHN'S
SALLOWNESS WAS OWING TO OVER APPLICATION AND PERHAPS TO PINING AFTER
HOME
JOHN HAD NOT MUCH AFFECTION FOR HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AN ANTIPATHY
TO ME
HE BULLIED AND PUNISHED ME NOT TWO OR THREE TIMES IN THE WEEK
NOR ONCE OR TWICE IN THE DAY BUT CONTINUALLY EVERY NERVE I HAD FEARED
HIM AND EVERY MORSEL OF FLESH IN MY BONES SHRANK WHEN HE CAME NEAR
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I WAS BEWILDERED BY THE TERROR HE INSPIRED
BECAUSE I HAD NO APPEAL WHATEVER AGAINST EITHER HIS MENACES OR HIS
INFLICTIONS THE SERVANTS DID NOT LIKE TO OFFEND THEIR YOUNG MASTER BY
TAKING MY PART AGAINST HIM AND MRS
REED WAS BLIND AND DEAF ON THE
SUBJECT SHE NEVER SAW HIM STRIKE OR HEARD HIM ABUSE ME THOUGH HE DID
BOTH NOW AND THEN IN HER VERY PRESENCE MORE FREQUENTLY HOWEVER BEHIND
HER BACK
HABITUALLY OBEDIENT TO JOHN I CAME UP TO HIS CHAIR HE SPENT SOME THREE
MINUTES IN THRUSTING OUT HIS TONGUE AT ME AS FAR AS HE COULD WITHOUT
DAMAGING THE ROOTS I KNEW HE WOULD SOON STRIKE AND WHILE DREADING THE
BLOW I MUSED ON THE DISGUSTING AND UGLY APPEARANCE OF HIM WHO WOULD
PRESENTLY DEAL IT
I WONDER IF HE READ THAT NOTION IN MY FACE FOR ALL
AT ONCE WITHOUT SPEAKING HE STRUCK SUDDENLY AND STRONGLY
I TOTTERED
AND ON REGAINING MY EQUILIBRIUM RETIRED BACK A STEP OR TWO FROM HIS
CHAIR
THAT IS FOR YOUR IMPUDENCE IN ANSWERING MAMA AWHILE SINCE SAID HE
AND FOR YOUR SNEAKING WAY OF GETTING BEHIND CURTAINS AND FOR THE LOOK
YOU HAD IN YOUR EYES TWO MINUTES SINCE YOU RAT
ACCUSTOMED TO JOHN REED'S ABUSE I NEVER HAD AN IDEA OF REPLYING TO IT
MY CARE WAS HOW TO ENDURE THE BLOW WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW THE
INSULT
WHAT WERE YOU DOING BEHIND THE CURTAIN HE ASKED
I WAS READING
SHOW THE BOOK
I RETURNED TO THE WINDOW AND FETCHED IT THENCE
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS TO TAKE OUR BOOKS YOU ARE A DEPENDENT MAMA SAYS
YOU HAVE NO MONEY YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU NONE YOU OUGHT TO BEG AND NOT
TO LIVE HERE WITH GENTLEMEN'S CHILDREN LIKE US AND EAT THE SAME MEALS WE
DO AND WEAR CLOTHES AT OUR MAMA'S EXPENSE
NOW I'LL TEACH YOU TO
RUMMAGE MY BOOKSHELVES FOR THEY ARE MINE ALL THE HOUSE BELONGS TO ME
OR WILL DO IN A FEW YEARS
GO AND STAND BY THE DOOR OUT OF THE WAY OF
THE MIRROR AND THE WINDOWS
I DID SO NOT AT FIRST AWARE WHAT WAS HIS INTENTION BUT WHEN I SAW HIM
LIFT AND POISE THE BOOK AND STAND IN ACT TO HURL IT I INSTINCTIVELY
STARTED ASIDE WITH A CRY OF ALARM NOT SOON ENOUGH HOWEVER THE VOLUME
WAS FLUNG IT HIT ME AND I FELL STRIKING MY HEAD AGAINST THE DOOR AND
CUTTING IT
THE CUT BLED THE PAIN WAS SHARP MY TERROR HAD PASSED ITS
CLIMAX OTHER FEELINGS SUCCEEDED
WICKED AND CRUEL BOY I SAID
YOU ARE LIKE A MURDERER YOU ARE LIKE A
SLAVE DRIVER YOU ARE LIKE THE ROMAN EMPERORS
I HAD READ GOLDSMITH'S HISTORY OF ROME AND HAD FORMED MY OPINION OF
NERO CALIGULA ETC
ALSO I HAD DRAWN PARALLELS IN SILENCE WHICH I NEVER
THOUGHT THUS TO HAVE DECLARED ALOUD
WHAT WHAT HE CRIED
DID SHE SAY THAT TO ME DID YOU HEAR HER
ELIZA AND GEORGIANA WON'T I TELL MAMA BUT FIRST
HE RAN HEADLONG AT ME I FELT HIM GRASP MY HAIR AND MY SHOULDER HE HAD
CLOSED WITH A DESPERATE THING
I REALLY SAW IN HIM A TYRANT A MURDERER
I FELT A DROP OR TWO OF BLOOD FROM MY HEAD TRICKLE DOWN MY NECK AND WAS
SENSIBLE OF SOMEWHAT PUNGENT SUFFERING THESE SENSATIONS FOR THE TIME
PREDOMINATED OVER FEAR AND I RECEIVED HIM IN FRANTIC SORT
I DON'T VERY
WELL KNOW WHAT I DID WITH MY HANDS BUT HE CALLED ME RAT RAT AND
BELLOWED OUT ALOUD
AID WAS NEAR HIM ELIZA AND GEORGIANA HAD RUN FOR
MRS
REED WHO WAS GONE UPSTAIRS SHE NOW CAME UPON THE SCENE FOLLOWED
BY BESSIE AND HER MAID ABBOT
WE WERE PARTED I HEARD THE WORDS
DEAR DEAR WHAT A FURY TO FLY AT MASTER JOHN
DID EVER ANYBODY SEE SUCH A PICTURE OF PASSION
THEN MRS
REED SUBJOINED
TAKE HER AWAY TO THE RED ROOM AND LOCK HER IN THERE FOUR HANDS WERE
IMMEDIATELY LAID UPON ME AND I WAS BORNE UPSTAIRS
CHAPTER II
I RESISTED ALL THE WAY A NEW THING FOR ME AND A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH
GREATLY STRENGTHENED THE BAD OPINION BESSIE AND MISS ABBOT WERE DISPOSED
TO ENTERTAIN OF ME
THE FACT IS I WAS A TRIFLE BESIDE MYSELF OR RATHER
OUT OF MYSELF AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT A MOMENT'S
MUTINY HAD ALREADY RENDERED ME LIABLE TO STRANGE PENALTIES AND LIKE ANY
OTHER REBEL SLAVE I FELT RESOLVED IN MY DESPERATION TO GO ALL LENGTHS
HOLD HER ARMS MISS ABBOT SHE'S LIKE A MAD CAT
FOR SHAME FOR SHAME CRIED THE LADY'S MAID
WHAT SHOCKING CONDUCT
MISS EYRE TO STRIKE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN YOUR BENEFACTRESS'S SON YOUR
YOUNG MASTER
MASTER HOW IS HE MY MASTER AM I A SERVANT
NO YOU ARE LESS THAN A SERVANT FOR YOU DO NOTHING FOR YOUR KEEP
THERE SIT DOWN AND THINK OVER YOUR WICKEDNESS
THEY HAD GOT ME BY THIS TIME INTO THE APARTMENT INDICATED BY MRS
REED
AND HAD THRUST ME UPON A STOOL MY IMPULSE WAS TO RISE FROM IT LIKE A
SPRING THEIR TWO PAIR OF HANDS ARRESTED ME INSTANTLY
IF YOU DON'T SIT STILL YOU MUST BE TIED DOWN SAID BESSIE
MISS
ABBOT LEND ME YOUR GARTERS SHE WOULD BREAK MINE DIRECTLY
MISS ABBOT TURNED TO DIVEST A STOUT LEG OF THE NECESSARY LIGATURE
THIS
PREPARATION FOR BONDS AND THE ADDITIONAL IGNOMINY IT INFERRED TOOK A
LITTLE OF THE EXCITEMENT OUT OF ME
DON'T TAKE THEM OFF I CRIED I WILL NOT STIR
IN GUARANTEE WHEREOF I ATTACHED MYSELF TO MY SEAT BY MY HANDS
MIND YOU DON'T SAID BESSIE AND WHEN SHE HAD ASCERTAINED THAT I WAS
REALLY SUBSIDING SHE LOOSENED HER HOLD OF ME THEN SHE AND MISS ABBOT
STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS LOOKING DARKLY AND DOUBTFULLY ON MY FACE AS
INCREDULOUS OF MY SANITY
SHE NEVER DID SO BEFORE AT LAST SAID BESSIE TURNING TO THE ABIGAIL
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN HER WAS THE REPLY
I'VE TOLD MISSIS OFTEN MY
OPINION ABOUT THE CHILD AND MISSIS AGREED WITH ME
SHE'S AN UNDERHAND
LITTLE THING I NEVER SAW A GIRL OF HER AGE WITH SO MUCH COVER
BESSIE ANSWERED NOT BUT ERE LONG ADDRESSING ME SHE SAID YOU OUGHT TO
BE AWARE MISS THAT YOU ARE UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO MRS
REED SHE KEEPS
YOU IF SHE WERE TO TURN YOU OFF YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE POORHOUSE
I HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THESE WORDS THEY WERE NOT NEW TO ME MY VERY
FIRST RECOLLECTIONS OF EXISTENCE INCLUDED HINTS OF THE SAME KIND
THIS
REPROACH OF MY DEPENDENCE HAD BECOME A VAGUE SING SONG IN MY EAR VERY
PAINFUL AND CRUSHING BUT ONLY HALF INTELLIGIBLE
MISS ABBOT JOINED IN
AND YOU OUGHT NOT TO THINK YOURSELF ON AN EQUALITY WITH THE MISSES REED
AND MASTER REED BECAUSE MISSIS KINDLY ALLOWS YOU TO BE BROUGHT UP WITH
THEM
THEY WILL HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND YOU WILL HAVE NONE IT
IS YOUR PLACE TO BE HUMBLE AND TO TRY TO MAKE YOURSELF AGREEABLE TO
THEM
WHAT WE TELL YOU IS FOR YOUR GOOD ADDED BESSIE IN NO HARSH VOICE
YOU SHOULD TRY TO BE USEFUL AND PLEASANT THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE
A HOME HERE BUT IF YOU BECOME PASSIONATE AND RUDE MISSIS WILL SEND YOU
AWAY I AM SURE
BESIDES SAID MISS ABBOT GOD WILL PUNISH HER HE MIGHT STRIKE HER
DEAD IN THE MIDST OF HER TANTRUMS AND THEN WHERE WOULD SHE GO COME
BESSIE WE WILL LEAVE HER I WOULDN'T HAVE HER HEART FOR ANYTHING
SAY
YOUR PRAYERS MISS EYRE WHEN YOU ARE BY YOURSELF FOR IF YOU DON'T
REPENT SOMETHING BAD MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND
FETCH YOU AWAY
THEY WENT SHUTTING THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT BEHIND THEM
THE RED ROOM WAS A SQUARE CHAMBER VERY SELDOM SLEPT IN I MIGHT SAY
NEVER INDEED UNLESS WHEN A CHANCE INFLUX OF VISITORS AT GATESHEAD HALL
RENDERED IT NECESSARY TO TURN TO ACCOUNT ALL THE ACCOMMODATION IT
CONTAINED YET IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND STATELIEST CHAMBERS IN THE
MANSION
A BED SUPPORTED ON MASSIVE PILLARS OF MAHOGANY HUNG WITH
CURTAINS OF DEEP RED DAMASK STOOD OUT LIKE A TABERNACLE IN THE CENTRE
THE TWO LARGE WINDOWS WITH THEIR BLINDS ALWAYS DRAWN DOWN WERE HALF
SHROUDED IN FESTOONS AND FALLS OF SIMILAR DRAPERY THE CARPET WAS RED
THE TABLE AT THE FOOT OF THE BED WAS COVERED WITH A CRIMSON CLOTH THE
WALLS WERE A SOFT FAWN COLOUR WITH A BLUSH OF PINK IN IT THE WARDROBE
THE TOILET TABLE THE CHAIRS WERE OF DARKLY POLISHED OLD MAHOGANY
OUT
OF THESE DEEP SURROUNDING SHADES ROSE HIGH AND GLARED WHITE THE PILED
UP MATTRESSES AND PILLOWS OF THE BED SPREAD WITH A SNOWY MARSEILLES
COUNTERPANE
SCARCELY LESS PROMINENT WAS AN AMPLE CUSHIONED EASY CHAIR
NEAR THE HEAD OF THE BED ALSO WHITE WITH A FOOTSTOOL BEFORE IT AND
LOOKING AS I THOUGHT LIKE A PALE THRONE
THIS ROOM WAS CHILL BECAUSE IT SELDOM HAD A FIRE IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE
REMOTE FROM THE NURSERY AND KITCHEN SOLEMN BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN TO BE
SO SELDOM ENTERED
THE HOUSE MAID ALONE CAME HERE ON SATURDAYS TO WIPE
FROM THE MIRRORS AND THE FURNITURE A WEEK'S QUIET DUST AND MRS
REED
HERSELF AT FAR INTERVALS VISITED IT TO REVIEW THE CONTENTS OF A CERTAIN
SECRET DRAWER IN THE WARDROBE WHERE WERE STORED DIVERS PARCHMENTS HER
JEWEL CASKET AND A MINIATURE OF HER DECEASED HUSBAND AND IN THOSE LAST
WORDS LIES THE SECRET OF THE RED ROOM THE SPELL WHICH KEPT IT SO LONELY
IN SPITE OF ITS GRANDEUR
MR
REED HAD BEEN DEAD NINE YEARS IT WAS IN THIS CHAMBER HE BREATHED HIS
LAST HERE HE LAY IN STATE HENCE HIS COFFIN WAS BORNE BY THE
UNDERTAKER'S MEN AND SINCE THAT DAY A SENSE OF DREARY CONSECRATION HAD
GUARDED IT FROM FREQUENT INTRUSION
MY SEAT TO WHICH BESSIE AND THE BITTER MISS ABBOT HAD LEFT ME RIVETED
WAS A LOW OTTOMAN NEAR THE MARBLE CHIMNEY PIECE THE BED ROSE BEFORE ME
TO MY RIGHT HAND THERE WAS THE HIGH DARK WARDROBE WITH SUBDUED BROKEN
REFLECTIONS VARYING THE GLOSS OF ITS PANELS TO MY LEFT WERE THE MUFFLED
WINDOWS A GREAT LOOKING GLASS BETWEEN THEM REPEATED THE VACANT MAJESTY
OF THE BED AND ROOM
I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THEY HAD LOCKED THE
DOOR AND WHEN I DARED MOVE I GOT UP AND WENT TO SEE
ALAS YES NO
JAIL WAS EVER MORE SECURE
RETURNING I HAD TO CROSS BEFORE THE LOOKING
GLASS MY FASCINATED GLANCE INVOLUNTARILY EXPLORED THE DEPTH IT REVEALED
ALL LOOKED COLDER AND DARKER IN THAT VISIONARY HOLLOW THAN IN REALITY
AND THE STRANGE LITTLE FIGURE THERE GAZING AT ME WITH A WHITE FACE AND
ARMS SPECKING THE GLOOM AND GLITTERING EYES OF FEAR MOVING WHERE ALL
ELSE WAS STILL HAD THE EFFECT OF A REAL SPIRIT I THOUGHT IT LIKE ONE OF
THE TINY PHANTOMS HALF FAIRY HALF IMP BESSIE'S EVENING STORIES
REPRESENTED AS COMING OUT OF LONE FERNY DELLS IN MOORS AND APPEARING
BEFORE THE EYES OF BELATED TRAVELLERS
I RETURNED TO MY STOOL
SUPERSTITION WAS WITH ME AT THAT MOMENT BUT IT WAS NOT YET HER HOUR FOR
COMPLETE VICTORY MY BLOOD WAS STILL WARM THE MOOD OF THE REVOLTED SLAVE
WAS STILL BRACING ME WITH ITS BITTER VIGOUR I HAD TO STEM A RAPID RUSH
OF RETROSPECTIVE THOUGHT BEFORE I QUAILED TO THE DISMAL PRESENT
ALL JOHN REED'S VIOLENT TYRANNIES ALL HIS SISTERS' PROUD INDIFFERENCE
ALL HIS MOTHER'S AVERSION ALL THE SERVANTS' PARTIALITY TURNED UP IN MY
DISTURBED MIND LIKE A DARK DEPOSIT IN A TURBID WELL
WHY WAS I ALWAYS
SUFFERING ALWAYS BROWBEATEN ALWAYS ACCUSED FOR EVER CONDEMNED WHY
COULD I NEVER PLEASE WHY WAS IT USELESS TO TRY TO WIN ANY ONE'S FAVOUR
ELIZA WHO WAS HEADSTRONG AND SELFISH WAS RESPECTED
GEORGIANA WHO HAD
A SPOILED TEMPER A VERY ACRID SPITE A CAPTIOUS AND INSOLENT CARRIAGE
WAS UNIVERSALLY INDULGED
HER BEAUTY HER PINK CHEEKS AND GOLDEN CURLS
SEEMED TO GIVE DELIGHT TO ALL WHO LOOKED AT HER AND TO PURCHASE
INDEMNITY FOR EVERY FAULT
JOHN NO ONE THWARTED MUCH LESS PUNISHED
THOUGH HE TWISTED THE NECKS OF THE PIGEONS KILLED THE LITTLE PEA CHICKS
SET THE DOGS AT THE SHEEP STRIPPED THE HOTHOUSE VINES OF THEIR FRUIT
AND BROKE THE BUDS OFF THE CHOICEST PLANTS IN THE CONSERVATORY HE CALLED
HIS MOTHER OLD GIRL TOO SOMETIMES REVILED HER FOR HER DARK SKIN
SIMILAR TO HIS OWN BLUNTLY DISREGARDED HER WISHES NOT UNFREQUENTLY TORE
AND SPOILED HER SILK ATTIRE AND HE WAS STILL HER OWN DARLING I DARED
COMMIT NO FAULT I STROVE TO FULFIL EVERY DUTY AND I WAS TERMED NAUGHTY
AND TIRESOME SULLEN AND SNEAKING FROM MORNING TO NOON AND FROM NOON TO
NIGHT
MY HEAD STILL ACHED AND BLED WITH THE BLOW AND FALL I HAD RECEIVED NO
ONE HAD REPROVED JOHN FOR WANTONLY STRIKING ME AND BECAUSE I HAD TURNED
AGAINST HIM TO AVERT FARTHER IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE I WAS LOADED WITH
GENERAL OPPROBRIUM
UNJUST UNJUST SAID MY REASON FORCED BY THE AGONISING STIMULUS INTO
PRECOCIOUS THOUGH TRANSITORY POWER AND RESOLVE EQUALLY WROUGHT UP
INSTIGATED SOME STRANGE EXPEDIENT TO ACHIEVE ESCAPE FROM INSUPPORTABLE
OPPRESSION AS RUNNING AWAY OR IF THAT COULD NOT BE EFFECTED NEVER
EATING OR DRINKING MORE AND LETTING MYSELF DIE
WHAT A CONSTERNATION OF SOUL WAS MINE THAT DREARY AFTERNOON HOW ALL MY
BRAIN WAS IN TUMULT AND ALL MY HEART IN INSURRECTION YET IN WHAT
DARKNESS WHAT DENSE IGNORANCE WAS THE MENTAL BATTLE FOUGHT I COULD
NOT ANSWER THE CEASELESS INWARD QUESTION WHY I THUS SUFFERED NOW AT
THE DISTANCE OF I WILL NOT SAY HOW MANY YEARS I SEE IT CLEARLY
I WAS A DISCORD IN GATESHEAD HALL I WAS LIKE NOBODY THERE I HAD NOTHING
IN HARMONY WITH MRS
REED OR HER CHILDREN OR HER CHOSEN VASSALAGE
IF
THEY DID NOT LOVE ME IN FACT AS LITTLE DID I LOVE THEM
THEY WERE NOT
BOUND TO REGARD WITH AFFECTION A THING THAT COULD NOT SYMPATHISE WITH ONE
AMONGST THEM A HETEROGENEOUS THING OPPOSED TO THEM IN TEMPERAMENT IN
CAPACITY IN PROPENSITIES A USELESS THING INCAPABLE OF SERVING THEIR
INTEREST OR ADDING TO THEIR PLEASURE A NOXIOUS THING CHERISHING THE
GERMS OF INDIGNATION AT THEIR TREATMENT OF CONTEMPT OF THEIR JUDGMENT
I
KNOW THAT HAD I BEEN A SANGUINE BRILLIANT CARELESS EXACTING HANDSOME
ROMPING CHILD THOUGH EQUALLY DEPENDENT AND FRIENDLESS MRS
REED WOULD
HAVE ENDURED MY PRESENCE MORE COMPLACENTLY HER CHILDREN WOULD HAVE
ENTERTAINED FOR ME MORE OF THE CORDIALITY OF FELLOW FEELING THE SERVANTS
WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS PRONE TO MAKE ME THE SCAPEGOAT OF THE NURSERY
DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO FORSAKE THE RED ROOM IT WAS PAST FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE
BECLOUDED AFTERNOON WAS TENDING TO DREAR TWILIGHT
I HEARD THE RAIN
STILL BEATING CONTINUOUSLY ON THE STAIRCASE WINDOW AND THE WIND HOWLING
IN THE GROVE BEHIND THE HALL I GREW BY DEGREES COLD AS A STONE AND THEN
MY COURAGE SANK
MY HABITUAL MOOD OF HUMILIATION SELF DOUBT FORLORN
DEPRESSION FELL DAMP ON THE EMBERS OF MY DECAYING IRE
ALL SAID I WAS
WICKED AND PERHAPS I MIGHT BE SO WHAT THOUGHT HAD I BEEN BUT JUST
CONCEIVING OF STARVING MYSELF TO DEATH THAT CERTAINLY WAS A CRIME AND
WAS I FIT TO DIE OR WAS THE VAULT UNDER THE CHANCEL OF GATESHEAD CHURCH
AN INVITING BOURNE IN SUCH VAULT I HAD BEEN TOLD DID MR
REED LIE
BURIED AND LED BY THIS THOUGHT TO RECALL HIS IDEA I DWELT ON IT WITH
GATHERING DREAD
I COULD NOT REMEMBER HIM BUT I KNEW THAT HE WAS MY OWN
UNCLE MY MOTHER'S BROTHER THAT HE HAD TAKEN ME WHEN A PARENTLESS INFANT
TO HIS HOUSE AND THAT IN HIS LAST MOMENTS HE HAD REQUIRED A PROMISE OF
MRS
REED THAT SHE WOULD REAR AND MAINTAIN ME AS ONE OF HER OWN CHILDREN
MRS
REED PROBABLY CONSIDERED SHE HAD KEPT THIS PROMISE AND SO SHE HAD
I DARE SAY AS WELL AS HER NATURE WOULD PERMIT HER BUT HOW COULD SHE
REALLY LIKE AN INTERLOPER NOT OF HER RACE AND UNCONNECTED WITH HER
AFTER HER HUSBAND'S DEATH BY ANY TIE IT MUST HAVE BEEN MOST IRKSOME TO
FIND HERSELF BOUND BY A HARD WRUNG PLEDGE TO STAND IN THE STEAD OF A
PARENT TO A STRANGE CHILD SHE COULD NOT LOVE AND TO SEE AN UNCONGENIAL
ALIEN PERMANENTLY INTRUDED ON HER OWN FAMILY GROUP
A SINGULAR NOTION DAWNED UPON ME
I DOUBTED NOT NEVER DOUBTED THAT IF
MR
REED HAD BEEN ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE TREATED ME KINDLY AND NOW AS I
SAT LOOKING AT THE WHITE BED AND OVERSHADOWED WALLS OCCASIONALLY ALSO
TURNING A FASCINATED EYE TOWARDS THE DIMLY GLEANING MIRROR I BEGAN TO
RECALL WHAT I HAD HEARD OF DEAD MEN TROUBLED IN THEIR GRAVES BY THE
VIOLATION OF THEIR LAST WISHES REVISITING THE EARTH TO PUNISH THE
PERJURED AND AVENGE THE OPPRESSED AND I THOUGHT MR
REED'S SPIRIT
HARASSED BY THE WRONGS OF HIS SISTER'S CHILD MIGHT QUIT ITS
ABODE WHETHER IN THE CHURCH VAULT OR IN THE UNKNOWN WORLD OF THE
DEPARTED AND RISE BEFORE ME IN THIS CHAMBER
I WIPED MY TEARS AND
HUSHED MY SOBS FEARFUL LEST ANY SIGN OF VIOLENT GRIEF MIGHT WAKEN A
PRETERNATURAL VOICE TO COMFORT ME OR ELICIT FROM THE GLOOM SOME HALOED
FACE BENDING OVER ME WITH STRANGE PITY
THIS IDEA CONSOLATORY IN
THEORY I FELT WOULD BE TERRIBLE IF REALISED WITH ALL MY MIGHT I
ENDEAVOURED TO STIFLE IT I ENDEAVOURED TO BE FIRM
SHAKING MY HAIR FROM
MY EYES I LIFTED MY HEAD AND TRIED TO LOOK BOLDLY ROUND THE DARK ROOM
AT THIS MOMENT A LIGHT GLEAMED ON THE WALL
WAS IT I ASKED MYSELF A
RAY FROM THE MOON PENETRATING SOME APERTURE IN THE BLIND NO MOONLIGHT
WAS STILL AND THIS STIRRED WHILE I GAZED IT GLIDED UP TO THE CEILING
AND QUIVERED OVER MY HEAD
I CAN NOW CONJECTURE READILY THAT THIS STREAK
OF LIGHT WAS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GLEAM FROM A LANTERN CARRIED BY SOME
ONE ACROSS THE LAWN BUT THEN PREPARED AS MY MIND WAS FOR HORROR SHAKEN
AS MY NERVES WERE BY AGITATION I THOUGHT THE SWIFT DARTING BEAM WAS A
HERALD OF SOME COMING VISION FROM ANOTHER WORLD
MY HEART BEAT THICK MY
HEAD GREW HOT A SOUND FILLED MY EARS WHICH I DEEMED THE RUSHING OF
WINGS SOMETHING SEEMED NEAR ME I WAS OPPRESSED SUFFOCATED ENDURANCE
BROKE DOWN I RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND SHOOK THE LOCK IN DESPERATE EFFORT
STEPS CAME RUNNING ALONG THE OUTER PASSAGE THE KEY TURNED BESSIE AND
ABBOT ENTERED
MISS EYRE ARE YOU ILL SAID BESSIE
WHAT A DREADFUL NOISE IT WENT QUITE THROUGH ME EXCLAIMED ABBOT
TAKE ME OUT LET ME GO INTO THE NURSERY WAS MY CRY
WHAT FOR ARE YOU HURT HAVE YOU SEEN SOMETHING AGAIN DEMANDED
BESSIE
OH I SAW A LIGHT AND I THOUGHT A GHOST WOULD COME I HAD NOW GOT
HOLD OF BESSIE'S HAND AND SHE DID NOT SNATCH IT FROM ME
SHE HAS SCREAMED OUT ON PURPOSE DECLARED ABBOT IN SOME DISGUST
AND
WHAT A SCREAM IF SHE HAD BEEN IN GREAT PAIN ONE WOULD HAVE EXCUSED IT
BUT SHE ONLY WANTED TO BRING US ALL HERE I KNOW HER NAUGHTY TRICKS
WHAT IS ALL THIS DEMANDED ANOTHER VOICE PEREMPTORILY AND MRS
REED
CAME ALONG THE CORRIDOR HER CAP FLYING WIDE HER GOWN RUSTLING STORMILY
ABBOT AND BESSIE I BELIEVE I GAVE ORDERS THAT JANE EYRE SHOULD BE LEFT
IN THE RED ROOM TILL I CAME TO HER MYSELF
MISS JANE SCREAMED SO LOUD MA'AM PLEADED BESSIE
LET HER GO WAS THE ONLY ANSWER
LOOSE BESSIE'S HAND CHILD YOU
CANNOT SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT BY THESE MEANS BE ASSURED
I ABHOR
ARTIFICE PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN IT IS MY DUTY TO SHOW YOU THAT TRICKS
WILL NOT ANSWER YOU WILL NOW STAY HERE AN HOUR LONGER AND IT IS ONLY ON
CONDITION OF PERFECT SUBMISSION AND STILLNESS THAT I SHALL LIBERATE YOU
THEN
O AUNT HAVE PITY FORGIVE ME I CANNOT ENDURE IT LET ME BE PUNISHED
SOME OTHER WAY I SHALL BE KILLED IF
SILENCE THIS VIOLENCE IS ALL MOST REPULSIVE AND SO NO DOUBT SHE
FELT IT
I WAS A PRECOCIOUS ACTRESS IN HER EYES SHE SINCERELY LOOKED ON
ME AS A COMPOUND OF VIRULENT PASSIONS MEAN SPIRIT AND DANGEROUS
DUPLICITY
BESSIE AND ABBOT HAVING RETREATED MRS
REED IMPATIENT OF MY NOW FRANTIC
ANGUISH AND WILD SOBS ABRUPTLY THRUST ME BACK AND LOCKED ME IN WITHOUT
FARTHER PARLEY
I HEARD HER SWEEPING AWAY AND SOON AFTER SHE WAS GONE
I SUPPOSE I HAD A SPECIES OF FIT UNCONSCIOUSNESS CLOSED THE SCENE
CHAPTER III
THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER IS WAKING UP WITH A FEELING AS IF I HAD HAD A
FRIGHTFUL NIGHTMARE AND SEEING BEFORE ME A TERRIBLE RED GLARE CROSSED
WITH THICK BLACK BARS
I HEARD VOICES TOO SPEAKING WITH A HOLLOW
SOUND AND AS IF MUFFLED BY A RUSH OF WIND OR WATER AGITATION
UNCERTAINTY AND AN ALL PREDOMINATING SENSE OF TERROR CONFUSED MY
FACULTIES
ERE LONG I BECAME AWARE THAT SOME ONE WAS HANDLING ME
LIFTING ME UP AND SUPPORTING ME IN A SITTING POSTURE AND THAT MORE
TENDERLY THAN I HAD EVER BEEN RAISED OR UPHELD BEFORE
I RESTED MY HEAD
AGAINST A PILLOW OR AN ARM AND FELT EASY
IN FIVE MINUTES MORE THE CLOUD OF BEWILDERMENT DISSOLVED I KNEW QUITE
WELL THAT I WAS IN MY OWN BED AND THAT THE RED GLARE WAS THE NURSERY
FIRE
IT WAS NIGHT A CANDLE BURNT ON THE TABLE BESSIE STOOD AT THE BED
FOOT WITH A BASIN IN HER HAND AND A GENTLEMAN SAT IN A CHAIR NEAR MY
PILLOW LEANING OVER ME
I FELT AN INEXPRESSIBLE RELIEF A SOOTHING CONVICTION OF PROTECTION AND
SECURITY WHEN I KNEW THAT THERE WAS A STRANGER IN THE ROOM AN
INDIVIDUAL NOT BELONGING TO GATESHEAD AND NOT RELATED TO MRS
REED
TURNING FROM BESSIE THOUGH HER PRESENCE WAS FAR LESS OBNOXIOUS TO ME
THAN THAT OF ABBOT FOR INSTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN I SCRUTINISED THE
FACE OF THE GENTLEMAN I KNEW HIM IT WAS MR
LLOYD AN APOTHECARY
SOMETIMES CALLED IN BY MRS
REED WHEN THE SERVANTS WERE AILING FOR
HERSELF AND THE CHILDREN SHE EMPLOYED A PHYSICIAN
WELL WHO AM I HE ASKED
I PRONOUNCED HIS NAME OFFERING HIM AT THE SAME TIME MY HAND HE TOOK IT
SMILING AND SAYING WE SHALL DO VERY WELL BY AND BY THEN HE LAID ME
DOWN AND ADDRESSING BESSIE CHARGED HER TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT I WAS
NOT DISTURBED DURING THE NIGHT
HAVING GIVEN SOME FURTHER DIRECTIONS
AND INTIMATES THAT HE SHOULD CALL AGAIN THE NEXT DAY HE DEPARTED TO MY
GRIEF I FELT SO SHELTERED AND BEFRIENDED WHILE HE SAT IN THE CHAIR NEAR
MY PILLOW AND AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HIM ALL THE ROOM DARKENED AND
MY HEART AGAIN SANK INEXPRESSIBLE SADNESS WEIGHED IT DOWN
DO YOU FEEL AS IF YOU SHOULD SLEEP MISS ASKED BESSIE RATHER SOFTLY
SCARCELY DARED I ANSWER HER FOR I FEARED THE NEXT SENTENCE MIGHT BE
ROUGH
I WILL TRY
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRINK OR COULD YOU EAT ANYTHING
NO THANK YOU BESSIE
THEN I THINK I SHALL GO TO BED FOR IT IS PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK BUT YOU
MAY CALL ME IF YOU WANT ANYTHING IN THE NIGHT
WONDERFUL CIVILITY THIS IT EMBOLDENED ME TO ASK A QUESTION
BESSIE WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME AM I ILL
YOU FELL SICK I SUPPOSE IN THE RED ROOM WITH CRYING YOU'LL BE BETTER
SOON NO DOUBT
BESSIE WENT INTO THE HOUSEMAID'S APARTMENT WHICH WAS NEAR
I HEARD HER
SAY
SARAH COME AND SLEEP WITH ME IN THE NURSERY I DAREN'T FOR MY LIFE BE
ALONE WITH THAT POOR CHILD TO NIGHT SHE MIGHT DIE IT'S SUCH A STRANGE
THING SHE SHOULD HAVE THAT FIT I WONDER IF SHE SAW ANYTHING
MISSIS WAS
RATHER TOO HARD
SARAH CAME BACK WITH HER THEY BOTH WENT TO BED THEY WERE WHISPERING
TOGETHER FOR HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THEY FELL ASLEEP
I CAUGHT SCRAPS OF
THEIR CONVERSATION FROM WHICH I WAS ABLE ONLY TOO DISTINCTLY TO INFER
THE MAIN SUBJECT DISCUSSED
SOMETHING PASSED HER ALL DRESSED IN WHITE AND VANISHED A GREAT
BLACK DOG BEHIND HIM THREE LOUD RAPS ON THE CHAMBER DOOR A LIGHT IN
THE CHURCHYARD JUST OVER HIS GRAVE ETC ETC
AT LAST BOTH SLEPT THE FIRE AND THE CANDLE WENT OUT
FOR ME THE
WATCHES OF THAT LONG NIGHT PASSED IN GHASTLY WAKEFULNESS STRAINED BY
DREAD SUCH DREAD AS CHILDREN ONLY CAN FEEL
NO SEVERE OR PROLONGED BODILY ILLNESS FOLLOWED THIS INCIDENT OF THE RED
ROOM IT ONLY GAVE MY NERVES A SHOCK OF WHICH I FEEL THE REVERBERATION TO
THIS DAY
YES MRS
REED TO YOU I OWE SOME FEARFUL PANGS OF MENTAL
SUFFERING BUT I OUGHT TO FORGIVE YOU FOR YOU KNEW NOT WHAT YOU DID
WHILE RENDING MY HEART STRINGS YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE ONLY UPROOTING MY
BAD PROPENSITIES
NEXT DAY BY NOON I WAS UP AND DRESSED AND SAT WRAPPED IN A SHAWL BY
THE NURSERY HEARTH
I FELT PHYSICALLY WEAK AND BROKEN DOWN BUT MY WORSE
AILMENT WAS AN UNUTTERABLE WRETCHEDNESS OF MIND A WRETCHEDNESS WHICH
KEPT DRAWING FROM ME SILENT TEARS NO SOONER HAD I WIPED ONE SALT DROP
FROM MY CHEEK THAN ANOTHER FOLLOWED
YET I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO HAVE
BEEN HAPPY FOR NONE OF THE REEDS WERE THERE THEY WERE ALL GONE OUT IN
THE CARRIAGE WITH THEIR MAMA
ABBOT TOO WAS SEWING IN ANOTHER ROOM
AND BESSIE AS SHE MOVED HITHER AND THITHER PUTTING AWAY TOYS AND
ARRANGING DRAWERS ADDRESSED TO ME EVERY NOW AND THEN A WORD OF UNWONTED
KINDNESS
THIS STATE OF THINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TO ME A PARADISE OF
PEACE ACCUSTOMED AS I WAS TO A LIFE OF CEASELESS REPRIMAND AND THANKLESS
FAGGING BUT IN FACT MY RACKED NERVES WERE NOW IN SUCH A STATE THAT NO
CALM COULD SOOTHE AND NO PLEASURE EXCITE THEM AGREEABLY
BESSIE HAD BEEN DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN AND SHE BROUGHT UP WITH HER A TART
ON A CERTAIN BRIGHTLY PAINTED CHINA PLATE WHOSE BIRD OF PARADISE
NESTLING IN A WREATH OF CONVOLVULI AND ROSEBUDS HAD BEEN WONT TO STIR IN
ME A MOST ENTHUSIASTIC SENSE OF ADMIRATION AND WHICH PLATE I HAD OFTEN
PETITIONED TO BE ALLOWED TO TAKE IN MY HAND IN ORDER TO EXAMINE IT MORE
CLOSELY BUT HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO BEEN DEEMED UNWORTHY OF SUCH A
PRIVILEGE
THIS PRECIOUS VESSEL WAS NOW PLACED ON MY KNEE AND I WAS
CORDIALLY INVITED TO EAT THE CIRCLET OF DELICATE PASTRY UPON IT
VAIN
FAVOUR COMING LIKE MOST OTHER FAVOURS LONG DEFERRED AND OFTEN WISHED
FOR TOO LATE I COULD NOT EAT THE TART AND THE PLUMAGE OF THE BIRD
THE TINTS OF THE FLOWERS SEEMED STRANGELY FADED I PUT BOTH PLATE AND
TART AWAY
BESSIE ASKED IF I WOULD HAVE A BOOK THE WORD BOOK ACTED AS
A TRANSIENT STIMULUS AND I BEGGED HER TO FETCH GULLIVER'S TRAVELS FROM
THE LIBRARY
THIS BOOK I HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN PERUSED WITH DELIGHT
I
CONSIDERED IT A NARRATIVE OF FACTS AND DISCOVERED IN IT A VEIN OF
INTEREST DEEPER THAN WHAT I FOUND IN FAIRY TALES FOR AS TO THE ELVES
HAVING SOUGHT THEM IN VAIN AMONG FOXGLOVE LEAVES AND BELLS UNDER
MUSHROOMS AND BENEATH THE GROUND IVY MANTLING OLD WALL NOOKS I HAD AT
LENGTH MADE UP MY MIND TO THE SAD TRUTH THAT THEY WERE ALL GONE OUT OF
ENGLAND TO SOME SAVAGE COUNTRY WHERE THE WOODS WERE WILDER AND THICKER
AND THE POPULATION MORE SCANT WHEREAS LILLIPUT AND BROBDIGNAG BEING IN
MY CREED SOLID PARTS OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE I DOUBTED NOT THAT I MIGHT
ONE DAY BY TAKING A LONG VOYAGE SEE WITH MY OWN EYES THE LITTLE FIELDS
HOUSES AND TREES THE DIMINUTIVE PEOPLE THE TINY COWS SHEEP AND BIRDS
OF THE ONE REALM AND THE CORN FIELDS FOREST HIGH THE MIGHTY MASTIFFS
THE MONSTER CATS THE TOWER LIKE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE OTHER
YET WHEN
THIS CHERISHED VOLUME WAS NOW PLACED IN MY HAND WHEN I TURNED OVER ITS
LEAVES AND SOUGHT IN ITS MARVELLOUS PICTURES THE CHARM I HAD TILL NOW
NEVER FAILED TO FIND ALL WAS EERIE AND DREARY THE GIANTS WERE GAUNT
GOBLINS THE PIGMIES MALEVOLENT AND FEARFUL IMPS GULLIVER A MOST
DESOLATE WANDERER IN MOST DREAD AND DANGEROUS REGIONS
I CLOSED THE
BOOK WHICH I DARED NO LONGER PERUSE AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE BESIDE THE
UNTASTED TART
BESSIE HAD NOW FINISHED DUSTING AND TIDYING THE ROOM AND HAVING WASHED
HER HANDS SHE OPENED A CERTAIN LITTLE DRAWER FULL OF SPLENDID SHREDS OF
SILK AND SATIN AND BEGAN MAKING A NEW BONNET FOR GEORGIANA'S DOLL
MEANTIME SHE SANG HER SONG WAS
IN THE DAYS WHEN WE WENT GIPSYING
A LONG TIME AGO
I HAD OFTEN HEARD THE SONG BEFORE AND ALWAYS WITH LIVELY DELIGHT FOR
BESSIE HAD A SWEET VOICE AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO
BUT NOW THOUGH HER
VOICE WAS STILL SWEET I FOUND IN ITS MELODY AN INDESCRIBABLE SADNESS
SOMETIMES PREOCCUPIED WITH HER WORK SHE SANG THE REFRAIN VERY LOW VERY
LINGERINGLY A LONG TIME AGO CAME OUT LIKE THE SADDEST CADENCE OF A
FUNERAL HYMN
SHE PASSED INTO ANOTHER BALLAD THIS TIME A REALLY DOLEFUL
ONE
MY FEET THEY ARE SORE AND MY LIMBS THEY ARE WEARY
LONG IS THE WAY AND THE MOUNTAINS ARE WILD
SOON WILL THE TWILIGHT CLOSE MOONLESS AND DREARY
OVER THE PATH OF THE POOR ORPHAN CHILD
WHY DID THEY SEND ME SO FAR AND SO LONELY
UP WHERE THE MOORS SPREAD AND GREY ROCKS ARE PILED
MEN ARE HARD HEARTED AND KIND ANGELS ONLY
WATCH O'ER THE STEPS OF A POOR ORPHAN CHILD
YET DISTANT AND SOFT THE NIGHT BREEZE IS BLOWING
CLOUDS THERE ARE NONE AND CLEAR STARS BEAM MILD
GOD IN HIS MERCY PROTECTION IS SHOWING
COMFORT AND HOPE TO THE POOR ORPHAN CHILD
EV'N SHOULD I FALL O'ER THE BROKEN BRIDGE PASSING
OR STRAY IN THE MARSHES BY FALSE LIGHTS BEGUILED
STILL WILL MY FATHER WITH PROMISE AND BLESSING
TAKE TO HIS BOSOM THE POOR ORPHAN CHILD
THERE IS A THOUGHT THAT FOR STRENGTH SHOULD AVAIL ME
THOUGH BOTH OF SHELTER AND KINDRED DESPOILED
HEAVEN IS A HOME AND A REST WILL NOT FAIL ME
GOD IS A FRIEND TO THE POOR ORPHAN CHILD
COME MISS JANE DON'T CRY SAID BESSIE AS SHE FINISHED
SHE MIGHT AS
WELL HAVE SAID TO THE FIRE DON'T BURN BUT HOW COULD SHE DIVINE THE
MORBID SUFFERING TO WHICH I WAS A PREY IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING MR
LLOYD CAME AGAIN
WHAT ALREADY UP SAID HE AS HE ENTERED THE NURSERY
WELL NURSE
HOW IS SHE
BESSIE ANSWERED THAT I WAS DOING VERY WELL
THEN SHE OUGHT TO LOOK MORE CHEERFUL
COME HERE MISS JANE YOUR NAME
IS JANE IS IT NOT
YES SIR JANE EYRE
WELL YOU HAVE BEEN CRYING MISS JANE EYRE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT ABOUT
HAVE YOU ANY PAIN
NO SIR
OH I DARESAY SHE IS CRYING BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT GO OUT WITH MISSIS IN
THE CARRIAGE INTERPOSED BESSIE
SURELY NOT WHY SHE IS TOO OLD FOR SUCH PETTISHNESS
I THOUGHT SO TOO AND MY SELF ESTEEM BEING WOUNDED BY THE FALSE CHARGE I
ANSWERED PROMPTLY I NEVER CRIED FOR SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE I HATE
GOING OUT IN THE CARRIAGE
I CRY BECAUSE I AM MISERABLE
OH FIE MISS SAID BESSIE
THE GOOD APOTHECARY APPEARED A LITTLE PUZZLED
I WAS STANDING BEFORE
HIM HE FIXED HIS EYES ON ME VERY STEADILY HIS EYES WERE SMALL AND GREY
NOT VERY BRIGHT BUT I DARE SAY I SHOULD THINK THEM SHREWD NOW HE HAD A
HARD FEATURED YET GOOD NATURED LOOKING FACE
HAVING CONSIDERED ME AT
LEISURE HE SAID
WHAT MADE YOU ILL YESTERDAY
SHE HAD A FALL SAID BESSIE AGAIN PUTTING IN HER WORD
FALL WHY THAT IS LIKE A BABY AGAIN CAN'T SHE MANAGE TO WALK AT HER
AGE SHE MUST BE EIGHT OR NINE YEARS OLD
I WAS KNOCKED DOWN WAS THE BLUNT EXPLANATION JERKED OUT OF ME BY
ANOTHER PANG OF MORTIFIED PRIDE BUT THAT DID NOT MAKE ME ILL I ADDED
WHILE MR
LLOYD HELPED HIMSELF TO A PINCH OF SNUFF
AS HE WAS RETURNING THE BOX TO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET A LOUD BELL RANG FOR
THE SERVANTS' DINNER HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS
THAT'S FOR YOU NURSE SAID
HE YOU CAN GO DOWN I'LL GIVE MISS JANE A LECTURE TILL YOU COME BACK
BESSIE WOULD RATHER HAVE STAYED BUT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO GO BECAUSE
PUNCTUALITY AT MEALS WAS RIGIDLY ENFORCED AT GATESHEAD HALL
THE FALL DID NOT MAKE YOU ILL WHAT DID THEN PURSUED MR
LLOYD WHEN
BESSIE WAS GONE
I WAS SHUT UP IN A ROOM WHERE THERE IS A GHOST TILL AFTER DARK
I SAW MR
LLOYD SMILE AND FROWN AT THE SAME TIME
GHOST WHAT YOU ARE A BABY AFTER ALL YOU ARE AFRAID OF GHOSTS
OF MR
REED'S GHOST I AM HE DIED IN THAT ROOM AND WAS LAID OUT THERE
NEITHER BESSIE NOR ANY ONE ELSE WILL GO INTO IT AT NIGHT IF THEY CAN
HELP IT AND IT WAS CRUEL TO SHUT ME UP ALONE WITHOUT A CANDLE SO CRUEL
THAT I THINK I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT
NONSENSE AND IS IT THAT MAKES YOU SO MISERABLE ARE YOU AFRAID NOW IN
DAYLIGHT
NO BUT NIGHT WILL COME AGAIN BEFORE LONG AND BESIDES I AM
UNHAPPY VERY UNHAPPY FOR OTHER THINGS
WHAT OTHER THINGS CAN YOU TELL ME SOME OF THEM
HOW MUCH I WISHED TO REPLY FULLY TO THIS QUESTION HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS
TO FRAME ANY ANSWER CHILDREN CAN FEEL BUT THEY CANNOT ANALYSE THEIR
FEELINGS AND IF THE ANALYSIS IS PARTIALLY EFFECTED IN THOUGHT THEY KNOW
NOT HOW TO EXPRESS THE RESULT OF THE PROCESS IN WORDS
FEARFUL HOWEVER
OF LOSING THIS FIRST AND ONLY OPPORTUNITY OF RELIEVING MY GRIEF BY
IMPARTING IT I AFTER A DISTURBED PAUSE CONTRIVED TO FRAME A MEAGRE
THOUGH AS FAR AS IT WENT TRUE RESPONSE
FOR ONE THING I HAVE NO FATHER OR MOTHER BROTHERS OR SISTERS
YOU HAVE A KIND AUNT AND COUSINS
AGAIN I PAUSED THEN BUNGLINGLY ENOUNCED
BUT JOHN REED KNOCKED ME DOWN AND MY AUNT SHUT ME UP IN THE RED ROOM
MR
LLOYD A SECOND TIME PRODUCED HIS SNUFF BOX
DON'T YOU THINK GATESHEAD HALL A VERY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE ASKED HE
ARE
YOU NOT VERY THANKFUL TO HAVE SUCH A FINE PLACE TO LIVE AT
IT IS NOT MY HOUSE SIR AND ABBOT SAYS I HAVE LESS RIGHT TO BE HERE
THAN A SERVANT
POOH YOU CAN'T BE SILLY ENOUGH TO WISH TO LEAVE SUCH A SPLENDID PLACE
IF I HAD ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO I SHOULD BE GLAD TO LEAVE IT BUT I CAN
NEVER GET AWAY FROM GATESHEAD TILL I AM A WOMAN
PERHAPS YOU MAY WHO KNOWS HAVE YOU ANY RELATIONS BESIDES MRS
REED
I THINK NOT SIR
NONE BELONGING TO YOUR FATHER
I DON'T KNOW
I ASKED AUNT REED ONCE AND SHE SAID POSSIBLY I MIGHT
HAVE SOME POOR LOW RELATIONS CALLED EYRE BUT SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT
THEM
IF YOU HAD SUCH WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO THEM
I REFLECTED
POVERTY LOOKS GRIM TO GROWN PEOPLE STILL MORE SO TO
CHILDREN THEY HAVE NOT MUCH IDEA OF INDUSTRIOUS WORKING RESPECTABLE
POVERTY THEY THINK OF THE WORD ONLY AS CONNECTED WITH RAGGED CLOTHES
SCANTY FOOD FIRELESS GRATES RUDE MANNERS AND DEBASING VICES POVERTY
FOR ME WAS SYNONYMOUS WITH DEGRADATION
NO I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO BELONG TO POOR PEOPLE WAS MY REPLY
NOT EVEN IF THEY WERE KIND TO YOU
I SHOOK MY HEAD I COULD NOT SEE HOW POOR PEOPLE HAD THE MEANS OF BEING
KIND AND THEN TO LEARN TO SPEAK LIKE THEM TO ADOPT THEIR MANNERS TO BE
UNEDUCATED TO GROW UP LIKE ONE OF THE POOR WOMEN I SAW SOMETIMES NURSING
THEIR CHILDREN OR WASHING THEIR CLOTHES AT THE COTTAGE DOORS OF THE
VILLAGE OF GATESHEAD NO I WAS NOT HEROIC ENOUGH TO PURCHASE LIBERTY AT
THE PRICE OF CASTE
BUT ARE YOUR RELATIVES SO VERY POOR ARE THEY WORKING PEOPLE
I CANNOT TELL AUNT REED SAYS IF I HAVE ANY THEY MUST BE A BEGGARLY
SET I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO GO A BEGGING
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO SCHOOL
AGAIN I REFLECTED I SCARCELY KNEW WHAT SCHOOL WAS BESSIE SOMETIMES
SPOKE OF IT AS A PLACE WHERE YOUNG LADIES SAT IN THE STOCKS WORE
BACKBOARDS AND WERE EXPECTED TO BE EXCEEDINGLY GENTEEL AND PRECISE JOHN
REED HATED HIS SCHOOL AND ABUSED HIS MASTER BUT JOHN REED'S TASTES WERE
NO RULE FOR MINE AND IF BESSIE'S ACCOUNTS OF SCHOOL DISCIPLINE GATHERED
FROM THE YOUNG LADIES OF A FAMILY WHERE SHE HAD LIVED BEFORE COMING TO
GATESHEAD WERE SOMEWHAT APPALLING HER DETAILS OF CERTAIN
ACCOMPLISHMENTS ATTAINED BY THESE SAME YOUNG LADIES WERE I THOUGHT
EQUALLY ATTRACTIVE
SHE BOASTED OF BEAUTIFUL PAINTINGS OF LANDSCAPES AND
FLOWERS BY THEM EXECUTED OF SONGS THEY COULD SING AND PIECES THEY COULD
PLAY OF PURSES THEY COULD NET OF FRENCH BOOKS THEY COULD TRANSLATE
TILL MY SPIRIT WAS MOVED TO EMULATION AS I LISTENED
BESIDES SCHOOL
WOULD BE A COMPLETE CHANGE IT IMPLIED A LONG JOURNEY AN ENTIRE
SEPARATION FROM GATESHEAD AN ENTRANCE INTO A NEW LIFE
I SHOULD INDEED LIKE TO GO TO SCHOOL WAS THE AUDIBLE CONCLUSION OF MY
MUSINGS
WELL WELL WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN SAID MR
LLOYD AS HE GOT UP
THE CHILD OUGHT TO HAVE CHANGE OF AIR AND SCENE HE ADDED SPEAKING TO
HIMSELF NERVES NOT IN A GOOD STATE
BESSIE NOW RETURNED AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CARRIAGE WAS HEARD ROLLING UP
THE GRAVEL WALK
IS THAT YOUR MISTRESS NURSE ASKED MR
LLOYD
I SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK
TO HER BEFORE I GO
BESSIE INVITED HIM TO WALK INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND LED THE WAY OUT
IN THE INTERVIEW WHICH FOLLOWED BETWEEN HIM AND MRS
REED I PRESUME
FROM AFTER OCCURRENCES THAT THE APOTHECARY VENTURED TO RECOMMEND MY
BEING SENT TO SCHOOL AND THE RECOMMENDATION WAS NO DOUBT READILY ENOUGH
ADOPTED FOR AS ABBOT SAID IN DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT WITH BESSIE WHEN
BOTH SAT SEWING IN THE NURSERY ONE NIGHT AFTER I WAS IN BED AND AS
THEY THOUGHT ASLEEP MISSIS WAS SHE DARED SAY GLAD ENOUGH TO GET RID
OF SUCH A TIRESOME ILL CONDITIONED CHILD WHO ALWAYS LOOKED AS IF SHE
WERE WATCHING EVERYBODY AND SCHEMING PLOTS UNDERHAND ABBOT I THINK
GAVE ME CREDIT FOR BEING A SORT OF INFANTINE GUY FAWKES
ON THAT SAME OCCASION I LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM MISS ABBOT'S
COMMUNICATIONS TO BESSIE THAT MY FATHER HAD BEEN A POOR CLERGYMAN THAT
MY MOTHER HAD MARRIED HIM AGAINST THE WISHES OF HER FRIENDS WHO
CONSIDERED THE MATCH BENEATH HER THAT MY GRANDFATHER REED WAS SO
IRRITATED AT HER DISOBEDIENCE HE CUT HER OFF WITHOUT A SHILLING THAT
AFTER MY MOTHER AND FATHER HAD BEEN MARRIED A YEAR THE LATTER CAUGHT THE
TYPHUS FEVER WHILE VISITING AMONG THE POOR OF A LARGE MANUFACTURING TOWN
WHERE HIS CURACY WAS SITUATED AND WHERE THAT DISEASE WAS THEN PREVALENT
THAT MY MOTHER TOOK THE INFECTION FROM HIM AND BOTH DIED WITHIN A MONTH
OF EACH OTHER
BESSIE WHEN SHE HEARD THIS NARRATIVE SIGHED AND SAID POOR MISS JANE
IS TO BE PITIED TOO ABBOT
YES RESPONDED ABBOT IF SHE WERE A NICE PRETTY CHILD ONE MIGHT
COMPASSIONATE HER FORLORNNESS BUT ONE REALLY CANNOT CARE FOR SUCH A
LITTLE TOAD AS THAT
NOT A GREAT DEAL TO BE SURE AGREED BESSIE AT ANY RATE A BEAUTY
LIKE MISS GEORGIANA WOULD BE MORE MOVING IN THE SAME CONDITION
YES I DOAT ON MISS GEORGIANA CRIED THE FERVENT ABBOT
LITTLE
DARLING WITH HER LONG CURLS AND HER BLUE EYES AND SUCH A SWEET COLOUR
AS SHE HAS JUST AS IF SHE WERE PAINTED BESSIE I COULD FANCY A WELSH
RABBIT FOR SUPPER
SO COULD I WITH A ROAST ONION
COME WE'LL GO DOWN THEY WENT
CHAPTER IV
FROM MY DISCOURSE WITH MR
LLOYD AND FROM THE ABOVE REPORTED CONFERENCE
BETWEEN BESSIE AND ABBOT I GATHERED ENOUGH OF HOPE TO SUFFICE AS A
MOTIVE FOR WISHING TO GET WELL A CHANGE SEEMED NEAR I DESIRED AND
WAITED IT IN SILENCE
IT TARRIED HOWEVER DAYS AND WEEKS PASSED I HAD
REGAINED MY NORMAL STATE OF HEALTH BUT NO NEW ALLUSION WAS MADE TO THE
SUBJECT OVER WHICH I BROODED
MRS
REED SURVEYED ME AT TIMES WITH A
SEVERE EYE BUT SELDOM ADDRESSED ME SINCE MY ILLNESS SHE HAD DRAWN A
MORE MARKED LINE OF SEPARATION THAN EVER BETWEEN ME AND HER OWN CHILDREN
APPOINTING ME A SMALL CLOSET TO SLEEP IN BY MYSELF CONDEMNING ME TO TAKE
MY MEALS ALONE AND PASS ALL MY TIME IN THE NURSERY WHILE MY COUSINS
WERE CONSTANTLY IN THE DRAWING ROOM
NOT A HINT HOWEVER DID SHE DROP
ABOUT SENDING ME TO SCHOOL STILL I FELT AN INSTINCTIVE CERTAINTY THAT
SHE WOULD NOT LONG ENDURE ME UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH HER FOR HER
GLANCE NOW MORE THAN EVER WHEN TURNED ON ME EXPRESSED AN INSUPERABLE
AND ROOTED AVERSION
ELIZA AND GEORGIANA EVIDENTLY ACTING ACCORDING TO ORDERS SPOKE TO ME AS
LITTLE AS POSSIBLE JOHN THRUST HIS TONGUE IN HIS CHEEK WHENEVER HE SAW
ME AND ONCE ATTEMPTED CHASTISEMENT BUT AS I INSTANTLY TURNED AGAINST
HIM ROUSED BY THE SAME SENTIMENT OF DEEP IRE AND DESPERATE REVOLT WHICH
HAD STIRRED MY CORRUPTION BEFORE HE THOUGHT IT BETTER TO DESIST AND RAN
FROM ME TITTERING EXECRATIONS AND VOWING I HAD BURST HIS NOSE
I HAD
INDEED LEVELLED AT THAT PROMINENT FEATURE AS HARD A BLOW AS MY KNUCKLES
COULD INFLICT AND WHEN I SAW THAT EITHER THAT OR MY LOOK DAUNTED HIM I
HAD THE GREATEST INCLINATION TO FOLLOW UP MY ADVANTAGE TO PURPOSE BUT HE
WAS ALREADY WITH HIS MAMA
I HEARD HIM IN A BLUBBERING TONE COMMENCE THE
TALE OF HOW THAT NASTY JANE EYRE HAD FLOWN AT HIM LIKE A MAD CAT HE
WAS STOPPED RATHER HARSHLY
DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT HER JOHN I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO NEAR HER SHE IS
NOT WORTHY OF NOTICE I DO NOT CHOOSE THAT EITHER YOU OR YOUR SISTERS
SHOULD ASSOCIATE WITH HER
HERE LEANING OVER THE BANISTER I CRIED OUT SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT AT ALL
DELIBERATING ON MY WORDS
THEY ARE NOT FIT TO ASSOCIATE WITH ME
MRS
REED WAS RATHER A STOUT WOMAN BUT ON HEARING THIS STRANGE AND
AUDACIOUS DECLARATION SHE RAN NIMBLY UP THE STAIR SWEPT ME LIKE A
WHIRLWIND INTO THE NURSERY AND CRUSHING ME DOWN ON THE EDGE OF MY CRIB
DARED ME IN AN EMPHATIC VOICE TO RISE FROM THAT PLACE OR UTTER ONE
SYLLABLE DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY
WHAT WOULD UNCLE REED SAY TO YOU IF HE WERE ALIVE WAS MY SCARCELY
VOLUNTARY DEMAND
I SAY SCARCELY VOLUNTARY FOR IT SEEMED AS IF MY
TONGUE PRONOUNCED WORDS WITHOUT MY WILL CONSENTING TO THEIR UTTERANCE
SOMETHING SPOKE OUT OF ME OVER WHICH I HAD NO CONTROL
WHAT SAID MRS
REED UNDER HER BREATH HER USUALLY COLD COMPOSED GREY
EYE BECAME TROUBLED WITH A LOOK LIKE FEAR SHE TOOK HER HAND FROM MY ARM
AND GAZED AT ME AS IF SHE REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER I WERE CHILD OR
FIEND
I WAS NOW IN FOR IT
MY UNCLE REED IS IN HEAVEN AND CAN SEE ALL YOU DO AND THINK AND SO CAN
PAPA AND MAMA THEY KNOW HOW YOU SHUT ME UP ALL DAY LONG AND HOW YOU
WISH ME DEAD
MRS
REED SOON RALLIED HER SPIRITS SHE SHOOK ME MOST SOUNDLY SHE BOXED
BOTH MY EARS AND THEN LEFT ME WITHOUT A WORD
BESSIE SUPPLIED THE
HIATUS BY A HOMILY OF AN HOUR'S LENGTH IN WHICH SHE PROVED BEYOND A
DOUBT THAT I WAS THE MOST WICKED AND ABANDONED CHILD EVER REARED UNDER A
ROOF
I HALF BELIEVED HER FOR I FELT INDEED ONLY BAD FEELINGS SURGING
IN MY BREAST
NOVEMBER DECEMBER AND HALF OF JANUARY PASSED AWAY
CHRISTMAS AND THE
NEW YEAR HAD BEEN CELEBRATED AT GATESHEAD WITH THE USUAL FESTIVE CHEER
PRESENTS HAD BEEN INTERCHANGED DINNERS AND EVENING PARTIES GIVEN
FROM
EVERY ENJOYMENT I WAS OF COURSE EXCLUDED MY SHARE OF THE GAIETY
CONSISTED IN WITNESSING THE DAILY APPARELLING OF ELIZA AND GEORGIANA AND
SEEING THEM DESCEND TO THE DRAWING ROOM DRESSED OUT IN THIN MUSLIN
FROCKS AND SCARLET SASHES WITH HAIR ELABORATELY RINGLETTED AND
AFTERWARDS IN LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF THE PIANO OR THE HARP PLAYED
BELOW TO THE PASSING TO AND FRO OF THE BUTLER AND FOOTMAN TO THE
JINGLING OF GLASS AND CHINA AS REFRESHMENTS WERE HANDED TO THE BROKEN
HUM OF CONVERSATION AS THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR OPENED AND CLOSED
WHEN
TIRED OF THIS OCCUPATION I WOULD RETIRE FROM THE STAIRHEAD TO THE
SOLITARY AND SILENT NURSERY THERE THOUGH SOMEWHAT SAD I WAS NOT
MISERABLE
TO SPEAK TRUTH I HAD NOT THE LEAST WISH TO GO INTO COMPANY
FOR IN COMPANY I WAS VERY RARELY NOTICED AND IF BESSIE HAD BUT BEEN KIND
AND COMPANIONABLE I SHOULD HAVE DEEMED IT A TREAT TO SPEND THE EVENINGS
QUIETLY WITH HER INSTEAD OF PASSING THEM UNDER THE FORMIDABLE EYE OF
MRS
REED IN A ROOM FULL OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
BUT BESSIE AS SOON
AS SHE HAD DRESSED HER YOUNG LADIES USED TO TAKE HERSELF OFF TO THE
LIVELY REGIONS OF THE KITCHEN AND HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM GENERALLY BEARING
THE CANDLE ALONG WITH HER
I THEN SAT WITH MY DOLL ON MY KNEE TILL THE
FIRE GOT LOW GLANCING ROUND OCCASIONALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING WORSE
THAN MYSELF HAUNTED THE SHADOWY ROOM AND WHEN THE EMBERS SANK TO A DULL
RED I UNDRESSED HASTILY TUGGING AT KNOTS AND STRINGS AS I BEST MIGHT
AND SOUGHT SHELTER FROM COLD AND DARKNESS IN MY CRIB
TO THIS CRIB I
ALWAYS TOOK MY DOLL HUMAN BEINGS MUST LOVE SOMETHING AND IN THE DEARTH
OF WORTHIER OBJECTS OF AFFECTION I CONTRIVED TO FIND A PLEASURE IN
LOVING AND CHERISHING A FADED GRAVEN IMAGE SHABBY AS A MINIATURE
SCARECROW
IT PUZZLES ME NOW TO REMEMBER WITH WHAT ABSURD SINCERITY I
DOATED ON THIS LITTLE TOY HALF FANCYING IT ALIVE AND CAPABLE OF
SENSATION
I COULD NOT SLEEP UNLESS IT WAS FOLDED IN MY NIGHT GOWN AND
WHEN IT LAY THERE SAFE AND WARM I WAS COMPARATIVELY HAPPY BELIEVING IT
TO BE HAPPY LIKEWISE
LONG DID THE HOURS SEEM WHILE I WAITED THE DEPARTURE OF THE COMPANY AND
LISTENED FOR THE SOUND OF BESSIE'S STEP ON THE STAIRS SOMETIMES SHE
WOULD COME UP IN THE INTERVAL TO SEEK HER THIMBLE OR HER SCISSORS OR
PERHAPS TO BRING ME SOMETHING BY WAY OF SUPPER A BUN OR A
CHEESE CAKE THEN SHE WOULD SIT ON THE BED WHILE I ATE IT AND WHEN I HAD
FINISHED SHE WOULD TUCK THE CLOTHES ROUND ME AND TWICE SHE KISSED ME
AND SAID GOOD NIGHT MISS JANE WHEN THUS GENTLE BESSIE SEEMED TO ME
THE BEST PRETTIEST KINDEST BEING IN THE WORLD AND I WISHED MOST
INTENSELY THAT SHE WOULD ALWAYS BE SO PLEASANT AND AMIABLE AND NEVER
PUSH ME ABOUT OR SCOLD OR TASK ME UNREASONABLY AS SHE WAS TOO OFTEN
WONT TO DO
BESSIE LEE MUST I THINK HAVE BEEN A GIRL OF GOOD NATURAL
CAPACITY FOR SHE WAS SMART IN ALL SHE DID AND HAD A REMARKABLE KNACK OF
NARRATIVE SO AT LEAST I JUDGE FROM THE IMPRESSION MADE ON ME BY HER
NURSERY TALES
SHE WAS PRETTY TOO IF MY RECOLLECTIONS OF HER FACE AND
PERSON ARE CORRECT
I REMEMBER HER AS A SLIM YOUNG WOMAN WITH BLACK
HAIR DARK EYES VERY NICE FEATURES AND GOOD CLEAR COMPLEXION BUT SHE
HAD A CAPRICIOUS AND HASTY TEMPER AND INDIFFERENT IDEAS OF PRINCIPLE OR
JUSTICE STILL SUCH AS SHE WAS I PREFERRED HER TO ANY ONE ELSE AT
GATESHEAD HALL
IT WAS THE FIFTEENTH OF JANUARY ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
BESSIE WAS GONE DOWN TO BREAKFAST MY COUSINS HAD NOT YET BEEN SUMMONED
TO THEIR MAMA ELIZA WAS PUTTING ON HER BONNET AND WARM GARDEN COAT TO GO
AND FEED HER POULTRY AN OCCUPATION OF WHICH SHE WAS FOND AND NOT LESS
SO OF SELLING THE EGGS TO THE HOUSEKEEPER AND HOARDING UP THE MONEY SHE
THUS OBTAINED
SHE HAD A TURN FOR TRAFFIC AND A MARKED PROPENSITY FOR
SAVING SHOWN NOT ONLY IN THE VENDING OF EGGS AND CHICKENS BUT ALSO IN
DRIVING HARD BARGAINS WITH THE GARDENER ABOUT FLOWER ROOTS SEEDS AND
SLIPS OF PLANTS THAT FUNCTIONARY HAVING ORDERS FROM MRS
REED TO BUY OF
HIS YOUNG LADY ALL THE PRODUCTS OF HER PARTERRE SHE WISHED TO SELL AND
ELIZA WOULD HAVE SOLD THE HAIR OFF HER HEAD IF SHE COULD HAVE MADE A
HANDSOME PROFIT THEREBY
AS TO HER MONEY SHE FIRST SECRETED IT IN ODD
CORNERS WRAPPED IN A RAG OR AN OLD CURL PAPER BUT SOME OF THESE HOARDS
HAVING BEEN DISCOVERED BY THE HOUSEMAID ELIZA FEARFUL OF ONE DAY LOSING
HER VALUED TREASURE CONSENTED TO INTRUST IT TO HER MOTHER AT A USURIOUS
RATE OF INTEREST FIFTY OR SIXTY PER CENT WHICH INTEREST SHE EXACTED
EVERY QUARTER KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS IN A LITTLE BOOK WITH ANXIOUS
ACCURACY
GEORGIANA SAT ON A HIGH STOOL DRESSING HER HAIR AT THE GLASS AND
INTERWEAVING HER CURLS WITH ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS AND FADED FEATHERS OF
WHICH SHE HAD FOUND A STORE IN A DRAWER IN THE ATTIC
I WAS MAKING MY
BED HAVING RECEIVED STRICT ORDERS FROM BESSIE TO GET IT ARRANGED BEFORE
SHE RETURNED FOR BESSIE NOW FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED ME AS A SORT OF UNDER
NURSERYMAID TO TIDY THE ROOM DUST THE CHAIRS C
HAVING SPREAD THE
QUILT AND FOLDED MY NIGHT DRESS I WENT TO THE WINDOW SEAT TO PUT IN
ORDER SOME PICTURE BOOKS AND DOLL'S HOUSE FURNITURE SCATTERED THERE AN
ABRUPT COMMAND FROM GEORGIANA TO LET HER PLAYTHINGS ALONE FOR THE TINY
CHAIRS AND MIRRORS THE FAIRY PLATES AND CUPS WERE HER PROPERTY STOPPED
MY PROCEEDINGS AND THEN FOR LACK OF OTHER OCCUPATION I FELL TO
BREATHING ON THE FROST FLOWERS WITH WHICH THE WINDOW WAS FRETTED AND
THUS CLEARING A SPACE IN THE GLASS THROUGH WHICH I MIGHT LOOK OUT ON THE
GROUNDS WHERE ALL WAS STILL AND PETRIFIED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A HARD
FROST
FROM THIS WINDOW WERE VISIBLE THE PORTER'S LODGE AND THE CARRIAGE ROAD
AND JUST AS I HAD DISSOLVED SO MUCH OF THE SILVER WHITE FOLIAGE VEILING
THE PANES AS LEFT ROOM TO LOOK OUT I SAW THE GATES THROWN OPEN AND A
CARRIAGE ROLL THROUGH
I WATCHED IT ASCENDING THE DRIVE WITH
INDIFFERENCE CARRIAGES OFTEN CAME TO GATESHEAD BUT NONE EVER BROUGHT
VISITORS IN WHOM I WAS INTERESTED IT STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE THE
DOOR BELL RANG LOUDLY THE NEW COMER WAS ADMITTED
ALL THIS BEING
NOTHING TO ME MY VACANT ATTENTION SOON FOUND LIVELIER ATTRACTION IN THE
SPECTACLE OF A LITTLE HUNGRY ROBIN WHICH CAME AND CHIRRUPED ON THE TWIGS
OF THE LEAFLESS CHERRY TREE NAILED AGAINST THE WALL NEAR THE CASEMENT
THE REMAINS OF MY BREAKFAST OF BREAD AND MILK STOOD ON THE TABLE AND
HAVING CRUMBLED A MORSEL OF ROLL I WAS TUGGING AT THE SASH TO PUT OUT
THE CRUMBS ON THE WINDOW SILL WHEN BESSIE CAME RUNNING UPSTAIRS INTO THE
NURSERY
MISS JANE TAKE OFF YOUR PINAFORE WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE HAVE YOU
WASHED YOUR HANDS AND FACE THIS MORNING I GAVE ANOTHER TUG BEFORE I
ANSWERED FOR I WANTED THE BIRD TO BE SECURE OF ITS BREAD THE SASH
YIELDED I SCATTERED THE CRUMBS SOME ON THE STONE SILL SOME ON THE
CHERRY TREE BOUGH THEN CLOSING THE WINDOW I REPLIED
NO BESSIE I HAVE ONLY JUST FINISHED DUSTING
TROUBLESOME CARELESS CHILD AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW YOU LOOK QUITE
RED AS IF YOU HAD BEEN ABOUT SOME MISCHIEF WHAT WERE YOU OPENING THE
WINDOW FOR
I WAS SPARED THE TROUBLE OF ANSWERING FOR BESSIE SEEMED IN TOO GREAT A
HURRY TO LISTEN TO EXPLANATIONS SHE HAULED ME TO THE WASHSTAND
INFLICTED A MERCILESS BUT HAPPILY BRIEF SCRUB ON MY FACE AND HANDS WITH
SOAP WATER AND A COARSE TOWEL DISCIPLINED MY HEAD WITH A BRISTLY
BRUSH DENUDED ME OF MY PINAFORE AND THEN HURRYING ME TO THE TOP OF THE
STAIRS BID ME GO DOWN DIRECTLY AS I WAS WANTED IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM
I WOULD HAVE ASKED WHO WANTED ME I WOULD HAVE DEMANDED IF MRS
REED WAS
THERE BUT BESSIE WAS ALREADY GONE AND HAD CLOSED THE NURSERY DOOR UPON
ME
I SLOWLY DESCENDED
FOR NEARLY THREE MONTHS I HAD NEVER BEEN
CALLED TO MRS
REED'S PRESENCE RESTRICTED SO LONG TO THE NURSERY THE
BREAKFAST DINING AND DRAWING ROOMS WERE BECOME FOR ME AWFUL REGIONS ON
WHICH IT DISMAYED ME TO INTRUDE
I NOW STOOD IN THE EMPTY HALL BEFORE ME WAS THE BREAKFAST ROOM DOOR AND
I STOPPED INTIMIDATED AND TREMBLING
WHAT A MISERABLE LITTLE POLTROON
HAD FEAR ENGENDERED OF UNJUST PUNISHMENT MADE OF ME IN THOSE DAYS I
FEARED TO RETURN TO THE NURSERY AND FEARED TO GO FORWARD TO THE PARLOUR
TEN MINUTES I STOOD IN AGITATED HESITATION THE VEHEMENT RINGING OF THE
BREAKFAST ROOM BELL DECIDED ME I MUST ENTER
WHO COULD WANT ME I ASKED INWARDLY AS WITH BOTH HANDS I TURNED THE
STIFF DOOR HANDLE WHICH FOR A SECOND OR TWO RESISTED MY EFFORTS
WHAT
SHOULD I SEE BESIDES AUNT REED IN THE APARTMENT A MAN OR A WOMAN THE
HANDLE TURNED THE DOOR UNCLOSED AND PASSING THROUGH AND CURTSEYING LOW
I LOOKED UP AT A BLACK PILLAR SUCH AT LEAST APPEARED TO ME AT FIRST
SIGHT THE STRAIGHT NARROW SABLE CLAD SHAPE STANDING ERECT ON THE RUG
THE GRIM FACE AT THE TOP WAS LIKE A CARVED MASK PLACED ABOVE THE SHAFT
BY WAY OF CAPITAL
MRS
REED OCCUPIED HER USUAL SEAT BY THE FIRESIDE SHE MADE A SIGNAL TO
ME TO APPROACH I DID SO AND SHE INTRODUCED ME TO THE STONY STRANGER
WITH THE WORDS THIS IS THE LITTLE GIRL RESPECTING WHOM I APPLIED TO
YOU
HE FOR IT WAS A MAN TURNED HIS HEAD SLOWLY TOWARDS WHERE I STOOD AND
HAVING EXAMINED ME WITH THE TWO INQUISITIVE LOOKING GREY EYES WHICH
TWINKLED UNDER A PAIR OF BUSHY BROWS SAID SOLEMNLY AND IN A BASS VOICE
HER SIZE IS SMALL WHAT IS HER AGE
TEN YEARS
SO MUCH WAS THE DOUBTFUL ANSWER AND HE PROLONGED HIS SCRUTINY FOR
SOME MINUTES
PRESENTLY HE ADDRESSED ME YOUR NAME LITTLE GIRL
JANE EYRE SIR
IN UTTERING THESE WORDS I LOOKED UP HE SEEMED TO ME A TALL GENTLEMAN
BUT THEN I WAS VERY LITTLE HIS FEATURES WERE LARGE AND THEY AND ALL THE
LINES OF HIS FRAME WERE EQUALLY HARSH AND PRIM
WELL JANE EYRE AND ARE YOU A GOOD CHILD
IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLY TO THIS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY LITTLE WORLD HELD A
CONTRARY OPINION I WAS SILENT
MRS
REED ANSWERED FOR ME BY AN
EXPRESSIVE SHAKE OF THE HEAD ADDING SOON PERHAPS THE LESS SAID ON THAT
SUBJECT THE BETTER MR
BROCKLEHURST
SORRY INDEED TO HEAR IT SHE AND I MUST HAVE SOME TALK AND BENDING
FROM THE PERPENDICULAR HE INSTALLED HIS PERSON IN THE ARM CHAIR OPPOSITE
MRS
REED'S
COME HERE HE SAID
I STEPPED ACROSS THE RUG HE PLACED ME SQUARE AND STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
WHAT A FACE HE HAD NOW THAT IT WAS ALMOST ON A LEVEL WITH MINE WHAT A
GREAT NOSE AND WHAT A MOUTH AND WHAT LARGE PROMINENT TEETH
NO SIGHT SO SAD AS THAT OF A NAUGHTY CHILD HE BEGAN ESPECIALLY A
NAUGHTY LITTLE GIRL
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE WICKED GO AFTER DEATH
THEY GO TO HELL WAS MY READY AND ORTHODOX ANSWER
AND WHAT IS HELL CAN YOU TELL ME THAT
A PIT FULL OF FIRE
AND SHOULD YOU LIKE TO FALL INTO THAT PIT AND TO BE BURNING THERE FOR
EVER
NO SIR
WHAT MUST YOU DO TO AVOID IT
I DELIBERATED A MOMENT MY ANSWER WHEN IT DID COME WAS OBJECTIONABLE
I MUST KEEP IN GOOD HEALTH AND NOT DIE
HOW CAN YOU KEEP IN GOOD HEALTH CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN YOU DIE DAILY
I
BURIED A LITTLE CHILD OF FIVE YEARS OLD ONLY A DAY OR TWO SINCE A GOOD
LITTLE CHILD WHOSE SOUL IS NOW IN HEAVEN
IT IS TO BE FEARED THE SAME
COULD NOT BE SAID OF YOU WERE YOU TO BE CALLED HENCE
NOT BEING IN A CONDITION TO REMOVE HIS DOUBT I ONLY CAST MY EYES DOWN ON
THE TWO LARGE FEET PLANTED ON THE RUG AND SIGHED WISHING MYSELF FAR
ENOUGH AWAY
I HOPE THAT SIGH IS FROM THE HEART AND THAT YOU REPENT OF EVER HAVING
BEEN THE OCCASION OF DISCOMFORT TO YOUR EXCELLENT BENEFACTRESS
BENEFACTRESS BENEFACTRESS SAID I INWARDLY THEY ALL CALL MRS
REED
MY BENEFACTRESS IF SO A BENEFACTRESS IS A DISAGREEABLE THING
DO YOU SAY YOUR PRAYERS NIGHT AND MORNING CONTINUED MY INTERROGATOR
YES SIR
DO YOU READ YOUR BIBLE
SOMETIMES
WITH PLEASURE ARE YOU FOND OF IT
I LIKE REVELATIONS AND THE BOOK OF DANIEL AND GENESIS AND SAMUEL AND
A LITTLE BIT OF EXODUS AND SOME PARTS OF KINGS AND CHRONICLES AND JOB
AND JONAH
AND THE PSALMS I HOPE YOU LIKE THEM
NO SIR
NO OH SHOCKING I HAVE A LITTLE BOY YOUNGER THAN YOU WHO KNOWS SIX
PSALMS BY HEART AND WHEN YOU ASK HIM WHICH HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A
GINGERBREAD NUT TO EAT OR A VERSE OF A PSALM TO LEARN HE SAYS 'OH THE
VERSE OF A PSALM ANGELS SING PSALMS SAYS HE 'I WISH TO BE A LITTLE
ANGEL HERE BELOW HE THEN GETS TWO NUTS IN RECOMPENSE FOR HIS INFANT
PIETY
PSALMS ARE NOT INTERESTING I REMARKED
THAT PROVES YOU HAVE A WICKED HEART AND YOU MUST PRAY TO GOD TO CHANGE
IT TO GIVE YOU A NEW AND CLEAN ONE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEART OF STONE AND
GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH
I WAS ABOUT TO PROPOUND A QUESTION TOUCHING THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT
OPERATION OF CHANGING MY HEART WAS TO BE PERFORMED WHEN MRS
REED
INTERPOSED TELLING ME TO SIT DOWN SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO CARRY ON THE
CONVERSATION HERSELF
MR
BROCKLEHURST I BELIEVE I INTIMATED IN THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO
YOU THREE WEEKS AGO THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL HAS NOT QUITE THE CHARACTER
AND DISPOSITION I COULD WISH SHOULD YOU ADMIT HER INTO LOWOOD SCHOOL I
SHOULD BE GLAD IF THE SUPERINTENDENT AND TEACHERS WERE REQUESTED TO KEEP
A STRICT EYE ON HER AND ABOVE ALL TO GUARD AGAINST HER WORST FAULT A
TENDENCY TO DECEIT
I MENTION THIS IN YOUR HEARING JANE THAT YOU MAY
NOT ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE ON MR
BROCKLEHURST
WELL MIGHT I DREAD WELL MIGHT I DISLIKE MRS
REED FOR IT WAS HER NATURE
TO WOUND ME CRUELLY NEVER WAS I HAPPY IN HER PRESENCE HOWEVER CAREFULLY
I OBEYED HOWEVER STRENUOUSLY I STROVE TO PLEASE HER MY EFFORTS WERE
STILL REPULSED AND REPAID BY SUCH SENTENCES AS THE ABOVE
NOW UTTERED
BEFORE A STRANGER THE ACCUSATION CUT ME TO THE HEART I DIMLY PERCEIVED
THAT SHE WAS ALREADY OBLITERATING HOPE FROM THE NEW PHASE OF EXISTENCE
WHICH SHE DESTINED ME TO ENTER I FELT THOUGH I COULD NOT HAVE EXPRESSED
THE FEELING THAT SHE WAS SOWING AVERSION AND UNKINDNESS ALONG MY FUTURE
PATH I SAW MYSELF TRANSFORMED UNDER MR
BROCKLEHURST'S EYE INTO AN
ARTFUL NOXIOUS CHILD AND WHAT COULD I DO TO REMEDY THE INJURY
NOTHING INDEED THOUGHT I AS I STRUGGLED TO REPRESS A SOB AND
HASTILY WIPED AWAY SOME TEARS THE IMPOTENT EVIDENCES OF MY ANGUISH
DECEIT IS INDEED A SAD FAULT IN A CHILD SAID MR
BROCKLEHURST IT
IS AKIN TO FALSEHOOD AND ALL LIARS WILL HAVE THEIR PORTION IN THE LAKE
BURNING WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE SHE SHALL HOWEVER BE WATCHED MRS
REED
I WILL SPEAK TO MISS TEMPLE AND THE TEACHERS
I SHOULD WISH HER TO BE BROUGHT UP IN A MANNER SUITING HER PROSPECTS
CONTINUED MY BENEFACTRESS TO BE MADE USEFUL TO BE KEPT HUMBLE AS FOR
THE VACATIONS SHE WILL WITH YOUR PERMISSION SPEND THEM ALWAYS AT
LOWOOD
YOUR DECISIONS ARE PERFECTLY JUDICIOUS MADAM RETURNED MR
BROCKLEHURST
HUMILITY IS A CHRISTIAN GRACE AND ONE PECULIARLY
APPROPRIATE TO THE PUPILS OF LOWOOD I THEREFORE DIRECT THAT ESPECIAL
CARE SHALL BE BESTOWED ON ITS CULTIVATION AMONGST THEM
I HAVE STUDIED
HOW BEST TO MORTIFY IN THEM THE WORLDLY SENTIMENT OF PRIDE AND ONLY THE
OTHER DAY I HAD A PLEASING PROOF OF MY SUCCESS
MY SECOND DAUGHTER
AUGUSTA WENT WITH HER MAMA TO VISIT THE SCHOOL AND ON HER RETURN SHE
EXCLAIMED 'OH DEAR PAPA HOW QUIET AND PLAIN ALL THE GIRLS AT LOWOOD
LOOK WITH THEIR HAIR COMBED BEHIND THEIR EARS AND THEIR LONG PINAFORES
AND THOSE LITTLE HOLLAND POCKETS OUTSIDE THEIR FROCKS THEY ARE ALMOST
LIKE POOR PEOPLE'S CHILDREN AND SAID SHE 'THEY LOOKED AT MY DRESS AND
MAMA'S AS IF THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A SILK GOWN BEFORE
THIS IS THE STATE OF THINGS I QUITE APPROVE RETURNED MRS
REED HAD I
SOUGHT ALL ENGLAND OVER I COULD SCARCELY HAVE FOUND A SYSTEM MORE
EXACTLY FITTING A CHILD LIKE JANE EYRE
CONSISTENCY MY DEAR MR
BROCKLEHURST I ADVOCATE CONSISTENCY IN ALL THINGS
CONSISTENCY MADAM IS THE FIRST OF CHRISTIAN DUTIES AND IT HAS BEEN
OBSERVED IN EVERY ARRANGEMENT CONNECTED WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LOWOOD
PLAIN FARE SIMPLE ATTIRE UNSOPHISTICATED ACCOMMODATIONS HARDY AND
ACTIVE HABITS SUCH IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY IN THE HOUSE AND ITS
INHABITANTS
QUITE RIGHT SIR
I MAY THEN DEPEND UPON THIS CHILD BEING RECEIVED AS A
PUPIL AT LOWOOD AND THERE BEING TRAINED IN CONFORMITY TO HER POSITION
AND PROSPECTS
MADAM YOU MAY SHE SHALL BE PLACED IN THAT NURSERY OF CHOSEN PLANTS
AND I TRUST SHE WILL SHOW HERSELF GRATEFUL FOR THE INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE
OF HER ELECTION
I WILL SEND HER THEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE MR
BROCKLEHURST FOR I
ASSURE YOU I FEEL ANXIOUS TO BE RELIEVED OF A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WAS
BECOMING TOO IRKSOME
NO DOUBT NO DOUBT MADAM AND NOW I WISH YOU GOOD MORNING

RETURN TO BROCKLEHURST HALL IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK OR TWO MY GOOD
FRIEND THE ARCHDEACON WILL NOT PERMIT ME TO LEAVE HIM SOONER

LITTLE GIRL HERE IS A BOOK ENTITLED THE 'CHILD'S
GUIDE READ IT WITH PRAYER ESPECIALLY THAT PART CONTAINING 'AN ACCOUNT
OF THE AWFULLY SUDDEN DEATH OF MARTHA G A NAUGHTY CHILD ADDICTED TO
FALSEHOOD AND DECEIT
WITH THESE WORDS MR
BROCKLEHURST PUT INTO MY HAND A THIN PAMPHLET SEWN
IN A COVER AND HAVING RUNG FOR HIS CARRIAGE HE DEPARTED
MRS
REED AND I WERE LEFT ALONE SOME MINUTES PASSED IN SILENCE SHE WAS
SEWING I WAS WATCHING HER
MRS
REED MIGHT BE AT THAT TIME SOME SIX OR
SEVEN AND THIRTY SHE WAS A WOMAN OF ROBUST FRAME SQUARE SHOULDERED AND
STRONG LIMBED NOT TALL AND THOUGH STOUT NOT OBESE SHE HAD A SOMEWHAT
LARGE FACE THE UNDER JAW BEING MUCH DEVELOPED AND VERY SOLID HER BROW
WAS LOW HER CHIN LARGE AND PROMINENT MOUTH AND NOSE SUFFICIENTLY
REGULAR UNDER HER LIGHT EYEBROWS GLIMMERED AN EYE DEVOID OF RUTH HER
SKIN WAS DARK AND OPAQUE HER HAIR NEARLY FLAXEN HER CONSTITUTION WAS
SOUND AS A BELL ILLNESS NEVER CAME NEAR HER SHE WAS AN EXACT CLEVER
MANAGER HER HOUSEHOLD AND TENANTRY WERE THOROUGHLY UNDER HER CONTROL
HER CHILDREN ONLY AT TIMES DEFIED HER AUTHORITY AND LAUGHED IT TO SCORN
SHE DRESSED WELL AND HAD A PRESENCE AND PORT CALCULATED TO SET OFF
HANDSOME ATTIRE
SITTING ON A LOW STOOL A FEW YARDS FROM HER ARM CHAIR I EXAMINED HER
FIGURE I PERUSED HER FEATURES
IN MY HAND I HELD THE TRACT CONTAINING
THE SUDDEN DEATH OF THE LIAR TO WHICH NARRATIVE MY ATTENTION HAD BEEN
POINTED AS TO AN APPROPRIATE WARNING
WHAT HAD JUST PASSED WHAT MRS
REED HAD SAID CONCERNING ME TO MR
BROCKLEHURST THE WHOLE TENOR OF THEIR
CONVERSATION WAS RECENT RAW AND STINGING IN MY MIND I HAD FELT EVERY
WORD AS ACUTELY AS I HAD HEARD IT PLAINLY AND A PASSION OF RESENTMENT
FOMENTED NOW WITHIN ME
MRS
REED LOOKED UP FROM HER WORK HER EYE SETTLED ON MINE HER FINGERS
AT THE SAME TIME SUSPENDED THEIR NIMBLE MOVEMENTS
GO OUT OF THE ROOM RETURN TO THE NURSERY WAS HER MANDATE
MY LOOK OR
SOMETHING ELSE MUST HAVE STRUCK HER AS OFFENSIVE FOR SHE SPOKE WITH
EXTREME THOUGH SUPPRESSED IRRITATION
I GOT UP I WENT TO THE DOOR I
CAME BACK AGAIN I WALKED TO THE WINDOW ACROSS THE ROOM THEN CLOSE UP
TO HER
SPEAK I MUST I HAD BEEN TRODDEN ON SEVERELY AND MUST TURN BUT HOW
WHAT STRENGTH HAD I TO DART RETALIATION AT MY ANTAGONIST I GATHERED MY
ENERGIES AND LAUNCHED THEM IN THIS BLUNT SENTENCE
I AM NOT DECEITFUL IF I WERE I SHOULD SAY I LOVED YOU BUT I DECLARE I
DO NOT LOVE YOU I DISLIKE YOU THE WORST OF ANYBODY IN THE WORLD EXCEPT
JOHN REED AND THIS BOOK ABOUT THE LIAR YOU MAY GIVE TO YOUR GIRL
GEORGIANA FOR IT IS SHE WHO TELLS LIES AND NOT I
MRS
REED'S HANDS STILL LAY ON HER WORK INACTIVE HER EYE OF ICE
CONTINUED TO DWELL FREEZINGLY ON MINE
WHAT MORE HAVE YOU TO SAY SHE ASKED RATHER IN THE TONE IN WHICH A
PERSON MIGHT ADDRESS AN OPPONENT OF ADULT AGE THAN SUCH AS IS ORDINARILY
USED TO A CHILD
THAT EYE OF HERS THAT VOICE STIRRED EVERY ANTIPATHY I HAD
SHAKING FROM
HEAD TO FOOT THRILLED WITH UNGOVERNABLE EXCITEMENT I CONTINUED
I AM GLAD YOU ARE NO RELATION OF MINE I WILL NEVER CALL YOU AUNT AGAIN
AS LONG AS I LIVE
I WILL NEVER COME TO SEE YOU WHEN I AM GROWN UP AND
IF ANY ONE ASKS ME HOW I LIKED YOU AND HOW YOU TREATED ME I WILL SAY
THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU MAKES ME SICK AND THAT YOU TREATED ME WITH
MISERABLE CRUELTY
HOW DARE YOU AFFIRM THAT JANE EYRE
HOW DARE I MRS
REED HOW DARE I BECAUSE IT IS THE TRUTH
YOU
THINK I HAVE NO FEELINGS AND THAT I CAN DO WITHOUT ONE BIT OF LOVE OR
KINDNESS BUT I CANNOT LIVE SO AND YOU HAVE NO PITY
I SHALL REMEMBER
HOW YOU THRUST ME BACK ROUGHLY AND VIOLENTLY THRUST ME BACK INTO THE
RED ROOM AND LOCKED ME UP THERE TO MY DYING DAY THOUGH I WAS IN AGONY
THOUGH I CRIED OUT WHILE SUFFOCATING WITH DISTRESS 'HAVE MERCY HAVE
MERCY AUNT REED AND THAT PUNISHMENT YOU MADE ME SUFFER BECAUSE YOUR
WICKED BOY STRUCK ME KNOCKED ME DOWN FOR NOTHING
I WILL TELL ANYBODY
WHO ASKS ME QUESTIONS THIS EXACT TALE
PEOPLE THINK YOU A GOOD WOMAN
BUT YOU ARE BAD HARD HEARTED
YOU ARE DECEITFUL
HOW DARE I MRS
REED HOW DARE I BECAUSE IT IS THE TRUTH P30 JPG
ERE I HAD FINISHED THIS REPLY MY SOUL BEGAN TO EXPAND TO EXULT WITH
THE STRANGEST SENSE OF FREEDOM OF TRIUMPH I EVER FELT
IT SEEMED AS IF
AN INVISIBLE BOND HAD BURST AND THAT I HAD STRUGGLED OUT INTO UNHOPED
FOR LIBERTY
NOT WITHOUT CAUSE WAS THIS SENTIMENT MRS
REED LOOKED
FRIGHTENED HER WORK HAD SLIPPED FROM HER KNEE SHE WAS LIFTING UP HER
HANDS ROCKING HERSELF TO AND FRO AND EVEN TWISTING HER FACE AS IF SHE
WOULD CRY
JANE YOU ARE UNDER A MISTAKE WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU WHY DO YOU
TREMBLE SO VIOLENTLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRINK SOME WATER
NO MRS
REED
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WISH FOR JANE I ASSURE YOU I DESIRE TO BE
YOUR FRIEND
NOT YOU
YOU TOLD MR
BROCKLEHURST I HAD A BAD CHARACTER A DECEITFUL
DISPOSITION AND I'LL LET EVERYBODY AT LOWOOD KNOW WHAT YOU ARE AND WHAT
YOU HAVE DONE
JANE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS CHILDREN MUST BE CORRECTED FOR
THEIR FAULTS
DECEIT IS NOT MY FAULT I CRIED OUT IN A SAVAGE HIGH VOICE
BUT YOU ARE PASSIONATE JANE THAT YOU MUST ALLOW AND NOW RETURN TO THE
NURSERY THERE'S A DEAR AND LIE DOWN A LITTLE
I AM NOT YOUR DEAR I CANNOT LIE DOWN SEND ME TO SCHOOL SOON MRS
REED FOR I HATE TO LIVE HERE
I WILL INDEED SEND HER TO SCHOOL SOON MURMURED MRS
REED SOTTO VOCE
AND GATHERING UP HER WORK SHE ABRUPTLY QUITTED THE APARTMENT
I WAS LEFT THERE ALONE WINNER OF THE FIELD
IT WAS THE HARDEST BATTLE I
HAD FOUGHT AND THE FIRST VICTORY I HAD GAINED I STOOD AWHILE ON THE
RUG WHERE MR
BROCKLEHURST HAD STOOD AND I ENJOYED MY CONQUEROR'S
SOLITUDE
FIRST I SMILED TO MYSELF AND FELT ELATE BUT THIS FIERCE
PLEASURE SUBSIDED IN ME AS FAST AS DID THE ACCELERATED THROB OF MY
PULSES
A CHILD CANNOT QUARREL WITH ITS ELDERS AS I HAD DONE CANNOT
GIVE ITS FURIOUS FEELINGS UNCONTROLLED PLAY AS I HAD GIVEN MINE WITHOUT
EXPERIENCING AFTERWARDS THE PANG OF REMORSE AND THE CHILL OF REACTION
A
RIDGE OF LIGHTED HEATH ALIVE GLANCING DEVOURING WOULD HAVE BEEN A
MEET EMBLEM OF MY MIND WHEN I ACCUSED AND MENACED MRS
REED THE SAME
RIDGE BLACK AND BLASTED AFTER THE FLAMES ARE DEAD WOULD HAVE
REPRESENTED AS MEETLY MY SUBSEQUENT CONDITION WHEN HALF AN HOUR'S
SILENCE AND REFLECTION HAD SHOWN ME THE MADNESS OF MY CONDUCT AND THE
DREARINESS OF MY HATED AND HATING POSITION
SOMETHING OF VENGEANCE I HAD TASTED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS AROMATIC WINE
IT SEEMED ON SWALLOWING WARM AND RACY ITS AFTER FLAVOUR METALLIC AND
CORRODING GAVE ME A SENSATION AS IF I HAD BEEN POISONED
WILLINGLY
WOULD I NOW HAVE GONE AND ASKED MRS
REED'S PARDON BUT I KNEW PARTLY
FROM EXPERIENCE AND PARTLY FROM INSTINCT THAT WAS THE WAY TO MAKE HER
REPULSE ME WITH DOUBLE SCORN THEREBY RE EXCITING EVERY TURBULENT IMPULSE
OF MY NATURE
I WOULD FAIN EXERCISE SOME BETTER FACULTY THAN THAT OF FIERCE SPEAKING
FAIN FIND NOURISHMENT FOR SOME LESS FIENDISH FEELING THAN THAT OF SOMBRE
INDIGNATION
I TOOK A BOOK SOME ARABIAN TALES I SAT DOWN AND
ENDEAVOURED TO READ
I COULD MAKE NO SENSE OF THE SUBJECT MY OWN
THOUGHTS SWAM ALWAYS BETWEEN ME AND THE PAGE I HAD USUALLY FOUND
FASCINATING
I OPENED THE GLASS DOOR IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE
SHRUBBERY WAS QUITE STILL THE BLACK FROST REIGNED UNBROKEN BY SUN OR
BREEZE THROUGH THE GROUNDS
I COVERED MY HEAD AND ARMS WITH THE SKIRT
OF MY FROCK AND WENT OUT TO WALK IN A PART OF THE PLANTATION WHICH WAS
QUITE SEQUESTRATED BUT I FOUND NO PLEASURE IN THE SILENT TREES THE
FALLING FIR CONES THE CONGEALED RELICS OF AUTUMN RUSSET LEAVES SWEPT
BY PAST WINDS IN HEAPS AND NOW STIFFENED TOGETHER
I LEANED AGAINST A
GATE AND LOOKED INTO AN EMPTY FIELD WHERE NO SHEEP WERE FEEDING WHERE
THE SHORT GRASS WAS NIPPED AND BLANCHED
IT WAS A VERY GREY DAY A MOST
OPAQUE SKY ONDING ON SNAW CANOPIED ALL THENCE FLAKES FELT IT
INTERVALS WHICH SETTLED ON THE HARD PATH AND ON THE HOARY LEA WITHOUT
MELTING
I STOOD A WRETCHED CHILD ENOUGH WHISPERING TO MYSELF OVER AND
OVER AGAIN WHAT SHALL I DO WHAT SHALL I DO
ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A CLEAR VOICE CALL MISS JANE WHERE ARE YOU COME
TO LUNCH
IT WAS BESSIE I KNEW WELL ENOUGH BUT I DID NOT STIR HER LIGHT STEP
CAME TRIPPING DOWN THE PATH
YOU NAUGHTY LITTLE THING SHE SAID
WHY DON'T YOU COME WHEN YOU ARE
CALLED
BESSIE'S PRESENCE COMPARED WITH THE THOUGHTS OVER WHICH I HAD BEEN
BROODING SEEMED CHEERFUL EVEN THOUGH AS USUAL SHE WAS SOMEWHAT CROSS
THE FACT IS AFTER MY CONFLICT WITH AND VICTORY OVER MRS
REED I WAS NOT
DISPOSED TO CARE MUCH FOR THE NURSEMAID'S TRANSITORY ANGER AND I WAS
DISPOSED TO BASK IN HER YOUTHFUL LIGHTNESS OF HEART
I JUST PUT MY TWO
ARMS ROUND HER AND SAID COME BESSIE DON'T SCOLD
THE ACTION WAS MORE FRANK AND FEARLESS THAN ANY I WAS HABITUATED TO
INDULGE IN SOMEHOW IT PLEASED HER
YOU ARE A STRANGE CHILD MISS JANE SHE SAID AS SHE LOOKED DOWN AT ME
A LITTLE ROVING SOLITARY THING AND YOU ARE GOING TO SCHOOL I
SUPPOSE
I NODDED
AND WON'T YOU BE SORRY TO LEAVE POOR BESSIE
WHAT DOES BESSIE CARE FOR ME SHE IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME
BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A QUEER FRIGHTENED SHY LITTLE THING
YOU SHOULD
BE BOLDER
WHAT TO GET MORE KNOCKS
NONSENSE BUT YOU ARE RATHER PUT UPON THAT'S CERTAIN
MY MOTHER SAID
WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME LAST WEEK THAT SHE WOULD NOT LIKE A LITTLE ONE
OF HER OWN TO BE IN YOUR PLACE NOW COME IN AND I'VE SOME GOOD NEWS
FOR YOU
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE BESSIE
CHILD WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT SORROWFUL EYES YOU FIX ON ME WELL BUT
MISSIS AND THE YOUNG LADIES AND MASTER JOHN ARE GOING OUT TO TEA THIS
AFTERNOON AND YOU SHALL HAVE TEA WITH ME
I'LL ASK COOK TO BAKE YOU A
LITTLE CAKE AND THEN YOU SHALL HELP ME TO LOOK OVER YOUR DRAWERS FOR I
AM SOON TO PACK YOUR TRUNK
MISSIS INTENDS YOU TO LEAVE GATESHEAD IN A
DAY OR TWO AND YOU SHALL CHOOSE WHAT TOYS YOU LIKE TO TAKE WITH YOU
BESSIE YOU MUST PROMISE NOT TO SCOLD ME ANY MORE TILL I GO
WELL I WILL BUT MIND YOU ARE A VERY GOOD GIRL AND DON'T BE AFRAID OF
ME
DON'T START WHEN I CHANCE TO SPEAK RATHER SHARPLY IT'S SO
PROVOKING
I DON'T THINK I SHALL EVER BE AFRAID OF YOU AGAIN BESSIE BECAUSE I
HAVE GOT USED TO YOU AND I SHALL SOON HAVE ANOTHER SET OF PEOPLE TO
DREAD
IF YOU DREAD THEM THEY'LL DISLIKE YOU

I DON'T DISLIKE YOU MISS I BELIEVE I AM FONDER OF YOU THAN OF ALL THE
OTHERS
YOU DON'T SHOW IT
YOU LITTLE SHARP THING YOU'VE GOT QUITE A NEW WAY OF TALKING
WHAT
MAKES YOU SO VENTURESOME AND HARDY
WHY I SHALL SOON BE AWAY FROM YOU AND BESIDES I WAS GOING TO SAY
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN ME AND MRS
REED BUT ON SECOND
THOUGHTS I CONSIDERED IT BETTER TO REMAIN SILENT ON THAT HEAD
AND SO YOU'RE GLAD TO LEAVE ME
NOT AT ALL BESSIE INDEED JUST NOW I'M RATHER SORRY
JUST NOW AND RATHER HOW COOLLY MY LITTLE LADY SAYS IT I DARE SAY
NOW IF I WERE TO ASK YOU FOR A KISS YOU WOULDN'T GIVE IT ME YOU'D SAY

MUTUALLY EMBRACED AND I FOLLOWED HER INTO THE HOUSE QUITE COMFORTED
THAT AFTERNOON LAPSED IN PEACE AND HARMONY AND IN THE EVENING BESSIE
TOLD ME SOME OF HER MOST ENCHANTING STORIES AND SANG ME SOME OF HER
SWEETEST SONGS
EVEN FOR ME LIFE HAD ITS GLEAMS OF SUNSHINE
CHAPTER V
FIVE O'CLOCK HAD HARDLY STRUCK ON THE MORNING OF THE 19TH OF JANUARY
WHEN BESSIE BROUGHT A CANDLE INTO MY CLOSET AND FOUND ME ALREADY UP AND
NEARLY DRESSED
I HAD RISEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HER ENTRANCE AND HAD
WASHED MY FACE AND PUT ON MY CLOTHES BY THE LIGHT OF A HALF MOON JUST
SETTING WHOSE RAYS STREAMED THROUGH THE NARROW WINDOW NEAR MY CRIB
I
WAS TO LEAVE GATESHEAD THAT DAY BY A COACH WHICH PASSED THE LODGE GATES
AT SIX A M
BESSIE WAS THE ONLY PERSON YET RISEN SHE HAD LIT A FIRE IN
THE NURSERY WHERE SHE NOW PROCEEDED TO MAKE MY BREAKFAST
FEW CHILDREN
CAN EAT WHEN EXCITED WITH THE THOUGHTS OF A JOURNEY NOR COULD I
BESSIE
HAVING PRESSED ME IN VAIN TO TAKE A FEW SPOONFULS OF THE BOILED MILK AND
BREAD SHE HAD PREPARED FOR ME WRAPPED UP SOME BISCUITS IN A PAPER AND
PUT THEM INTO MY BAG THEN SHE HELPED ME ON WITH MY PELISSE AND BONNET
AND WRAPPING HERSELF IN A SHAWL SHE AND I LEFT THE NURSERY
AS WE
PASSED MRS
REED'S BEDROOM SHE SAID WILL YOU GO IN AND BID MISSIS GOOD
BYE
NO BESSIE SHE CAME TO MY CRIB LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU WERE GONE DOWN TO
SUPPER AND SAID I NEED NOT DISTURB HER IN THE MORNING OR MY COUSINS
EITHER AND SHE TOLD ME TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN MY BEST
FRIEND AND TO SPEAK OF HER AND BE GRATEFUL TO HER ACCORDINGLY
WHAT DID YOU SAY MISS
NOTHING I COVERED MY FACE WITH THE BEDCLOTHES AND TURNED FROM HER TO
THE WALL
THAT WAS WRONG MISS JANE
IT WAS QUITE RIGHT BESSIE
YOUR MISSIS HAS NOT BEEN MY FRIEND SHE HAS
BEEN MY FOE
O MISS JANE DON'T SAY SO
GOOD BYE TO GATESHEAD CRIED I AS WE PASSED THROUGH THE HALL AND WENT
OUT AT THE FRONT DOOR
THE MOON WAS SET AND IT WAS VERY DARK BESSIE CARRIED A LANTERN WHOSE
LIGHT GLANCED ON WET STEPS AND GRAVEL ROAD SODDEN BY A RECENT THAW
RAW
AND CHILL WAS THE WINTER MORNING MY TEETH CHATTERED AS I HASTENED DOWN
THE DRIVE
THERE WAS A LIGHT IN THE PORTER'S LODGE WHEN WE REACHED IT
WE FOUND THE PORTER'S WIFE JUST KINDLING HER FIRE MY TRUNK WHICH HAD
BEEN CARRIED DOWN THE EVENING BEFORE STOOD CORDED AT THE DOOR
IT
WANTED BUT A FEW MINUTES OF SIX AND SHORTLY AFTER THAT HOUR HAD STRUCK
THE DISTANT ROLL OF WHEELS ANNOUNCED THE COMING COACH I WENT TO THE DOOR
AND WATCHED ITS LAMPS APPROACH RAPIDLY THROUGH THE GLOOM
IS SHE GOING BY HERSELF ASKED THE PORTER'S WIFE
YES
AND HOW FAR IS IT
FIFTY MILES
WHAT A LONG WAY I WONDER MRS
REED IS NOT AFRAID TO TRUST HER SO FAR
ALONE
THE COACH DREW UP THERE IT WAS AT THE GATES WITH ITS FOUR HORSES AND ITS
TOP LADEN WITH PASSENGERS THE GUARD AND COACHMAN LOUDLY URGED HASTE MY
TRUNK WAS HOISTED UP I WAS TAKEN FROM BESSIE'S NECK TO WHICH I CLUNG
WITH KISSES
BE SURE AND TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER CRIED SHE TO THE GUARD AS HE LIFTED
ME INTO THE INSIDE
AY AY WAS THE ANSWER THE DOOR WAS SLAPPED TO A VOICE EXCLAIMED ALL
RIGHT AND ON WE DROVE
THUS WAS I SEVERED FROM BESSIE AND GATESHEAD
THUS WHIRLED AWAY TO UNKNOWN AND AS I THEN DEEMED REMOTE AND
MYSTERIOUS REGIONS
I REMEMBER BUT LITTLE OF THE JOURNEY I ONLY KNOW THAT THE DAY SEEMED TO
ME OF A PRETERNATURAL LENGTH AND THAT WE APPEARED TO TRAVEL OVER
HUNDREDS OF MILES OF ROAD
WE PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL TOWNS AND IN ONE
A VERY LARGE ONE THE COACH STOPPED THE HORSES WERE TAKEN OUT AND THE
PASSENGERS ALIGHTED TO DINE
I WAS CARRIED INTO AN INN WHERE THE GUARD
WANTED ME TO HAVE SOME DINNER BUT AS I HAD NO APPETITE HE LEFT ME IN
AN IMMENSE ROOM WITH A FIREPLACE AT EACH END A CHANDELIER PENDENT FROM
THE CEILING AND A LITTLE RED GALLERY HIGH UP AGAINST THE WALL FILLED
WITH MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
HERE I WALKED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME FEELING
VERY STRANGE AND MORTALLY APPREHENSIVE OF SOME ONE COMING IN AND
KIDNAPPING ME FOR I BELIEVED IN KIDNAPPERS THEIR EXPLOITS HAVING
FREQUENTLY FIGURED IN BESSIE'S FIRESIDE CHRONICLES
AT LAST THE GUARD
RETURNED ONCE MORE I WAS STOWED AWAY IN THE COACH MY PROTECTOR MOUNTED
HIS OWN SEAT SOUNDED HIS HOLLOW HORN AND AWAY WE RATTLED OVER THE
STONY STREET OF L
THE AFTERNOON CAME ON WET AND SOMEWHAT MISTY AS IT WANED INTO DUSK I
BEGAN TO FEEL THAT WE WERE GETTING VERY FAR INDEED FROM GATESHEAD WE
CEASED TO PASS THROUGH TOWNS THE COUNTRY CHANGED GREAT GREY HILLS
HEAVED UP ROUND THE HORIZON AS TWILIGHT DEEPENED WE DESCENDED A VALLEY
DARK WITH WOOD AND LONG AFTER NIGHT HAD OVERCLOUDED THE PROSPECT I
HEARD A WILD WIND RUSHING AMONGST TREES
LULLED BY THE SOUND I AT LAST DROPPED ASLEEP I HAD NOT LONG SLUMBERED
WHEN THE SUDDEN CESSATION OF MOTION AWOKE ME THE COACH DOOR WAS OPEN
AND A PERSON LIKE A SERVANT WAS STANDING AT IT I SAW HER FACE AND DRESS
BY THE LIGHT OF THE LAMPS
IS THERE A LITTLE GIRL CALLED JANE EYRE HERE SHE ASKED
I ANSWERED
YES AND WAS THEN LIFTED OUT MY TRUNK WAS HANDED DOWN AND THE COACH
INSTANTLY DROVE AWAY
I WAS STIFF WITH LONG SITTING AND BEWILDERED WITH THE NOISE AND MOTION
OF THE COACH GATHERING MY FACULTIES I LOOKED ABOUT ME
RAIN WIND AND
DARKNESS FILLED THE AIR NEVERTHELESS I DIMLY DISCERNED A WALL BEFORE ME
AND A DOOR OPEN IN IT THROUGH THIS DOOR I PASSED WITH MY NEW GUIDE SHE
SHUT AND LOCKED IT BEHIND HER
THERE WAS NOW VISIBLE A HOUSE OR
HOUSES FOR THE BUILDING SPREAD FAR WITH MANY WINDOWS AND LIGHTS
BURNING IN SOME WE WENT UP A BROAD PEBBLY PATH SPLASHING WET AND WERE
ADMITTED AT A DOOR THEN THE SERVANT LED ME THROUGH A PASSAGE INTO A ROOM
WITH A FIRE WHERE SHE LEFT ME ALONE
I STOOD AND WARMED MY NUMBED FINGERS OVER THE BLAZE THEN I LOOKED ROUND
THERE WAS NO CANDLE BUT THE UNCERTAIN LIGHT FROM THE HEARTH SHOWED BY
INTERVALS PAPERED WALLS CARPET CURTAINS SHINING MAHOGANY FURNITURE
IT WAS A PARLOUR NOT SO SPACIOUS OR SPLENDID AS THE DRAWING ROOM AT
GATESHEAD BUT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH
I WAS PUZZLING TO MAKE OUT THE
SUBJECT OF A PICTURE ON THE WALL WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND AN INDIVIDUAL
CARRYING A LIGHT ENTERED ANOTHER FOLLOWED CLOSE BEHIND
THE FIRST WAS A TALL LADY WITH DARK HAIR DARK EYES AND A PALE AND LARGE
FOREHEAD HER FIGURE WAS PARTLY ENVELOPED IN A SHAWL HER COUNTENANCE WAS
GRAVE HER BEARING ERECT
THE CHILD IS VERY YOUNG TO BE SENT ALONE SAID SHE PUTTING HER CANDLE
DOWN ON THE TABLE
SHE CONSIDERED ME ATTENTIVELY FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
THEN FURTHER ADDED
SHE HAD BETTER BE PUT TO BED SOON SHE LOOKS TIRED ARE YOU TIRED SHE
ASKED PLACING HER HAND ON MY SHOULDER
A LITTLE MA'AM
AND HUNGRY TOO NO DOUBT LET HER HAVE SOME SUPPER BEFORE SHE GOES TO
BED MISS MILLER
IS THIS THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE LEFT YOUR PARENTS TO
COME TO SCHOOL MY LITTLE GIRL
I EXPLAINED TO HER THAT I HAD NO PARENTS
SHE INQUIRED HOW LONG THEY HAD
BEEN DEAD THEN HOW OLD I WAS WHAT WAS MY NAME WHETHER I COULD READ
WRITE AND SEW A LITTLE THEN SHE TOUCHED MY CHEEK GENTLY WITH HER
FOREFINGER AND SAYING SHE HOPED I SHOULD BE A GOOD CHILD DISMISSED
ME ALONG WITH MISS MILLER
THE LADY I HAD LEFT MIGHT BE ABOUT TWENTY NINE THE ONE WHO WENT WITH ME
APPEARED SOME YEARS YOUNGER THE FIRST IMPRESSED ME BY HER VOICE LOOK
AND AIR
MISS MILLER WAS MORE ORDINARY RUDDY IN COMPLEXION THOUGH OF A
CAREWORN COUNTENANCE HURRIED IN GAIT AND ACTION LIKE ONE WHO HAD ALWAYS
A MULTIPLICITY OF TASKS ON HAND SHE LOOKED INDEED WHAT I AFTERWARDS
FOUND SHE REALLY WAS AN UNDER TEACHER
LED BY HER I PASSED FROM
COMPARTMENT TO COMPARTMENT FROM PASSAGE TO PASSAGE OF A LARGE AND
IRREGULAR BUILDING TILL EMERGING FROM THE TOTAL AND SOMEWHAT DREARY
SILENCE PERVADING THAT PORTION OF THE HOUSE WE HAD TRAVERSED WE CAME
UPON THE HUM OF MANY VOICES AND PRESENTLY ENTERED A WIDE LONG ROOM
WITH GREAT DEAL TABLES TWO AT EACH END ON EACH OF WHICH BURNT A PAIR OF
CANDLES AND SEATED ALL ROUND ON BENCHES A CONGREGATION OF GIRLS OF
EVERY AGE FROM NINE OR TEN TO TWENTY
SEEN BY THE DIM LIGHT OF THE
DIPS THEIR NUMBER TO ME APPEARED COUNTLESS THOUGH NOT IN REALITY
EXCEEDING EIGHTY THEY WERE UNIFORMLY DRESSED IN BROWN STUFF FROCKS OF
QUAINT FASHION AND LONG HOLLAND PINAFORES
IT WAS THE HOUR OF STUDY
THEY WERE ENGAGED IN CONNING OVER THEIR TO MORROW'S TASK AND THE HUM I
HAD HEARD WAS THE COMBINED RESULT OF THEIR WHISPERED REPETITIONS
MISS MILLER SIGNED TO ME TO SIT ON A BENCH NEAR THE DOOR THEN WALKING UP
TO THE TOP OF THE LONG ROOM SHE CRIED OUT
MONITORS COLLECT THE LESSON BOOKS AND PUT THEM AWAY
FOUR TALL GIRLS AROSE FROM DIFFERENT TABLES AND GOING ROUND GATHERED
THE BOOKS AND REMOVED THEM
MISS MILLER AGAIN GAVE THE WORD OF COMMAND
MONITORS FETCH THE SUPPER TRAYS
THE TALL GIRLS WENT OUT AND RETURNED PRESENTLY EACH BEARING A TRAY WITH
PORTIONS OF SOMETHING I KNEW NOT WHAT ARRANGED THEREON AND A PITCHER
OF WATER AND MUG IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH TRAY
THE PORTIONS WERE HANDED
ROUND THOSE WHO LIKED TOOK A DRAUGHT OF THE WATER THE MUG BEING COMMON
TO ALL
WHEN IT CAME TO MY TURN I DRANK FOR I WAS THIRSTY BUT DID NOT
TOUCH THE FOOD EXCITEMENT AND FATIGUE RENDERING ME INCAPABLE OF EATING
I NOW SAW HOWEVER THAT IT WAS A THIN OATEN CAKE SHARED INTO FRAGMENTS
THE MEAL OVER PRAYERS WERE READ BY MISS MILLER AND THE CLASSES FILED
OFF TWO AND TWO UPSTAIRS
OVERPOWERED BY THIS TIME WITH WEARINESS I
SCARCELY NOTICED WHAT SORT OF A PLACE THE BEDROOM WAS EXCEPT THAT LIKE
THE SCHOOLROOM I SAW IT WAS VERY LONG
TO NIGHT I WAS TO BE MISS
MILLER'S BED FELLOW SHE HELPED ME TO UNDRESS WHEN LAID DOWN I GLANCED
AT THE LONG ROWS OF BEDS EACH OF WHICH WAS QUICKLY FILLED WITH TWO
OCCUPANTS IN TEN MINUTES THE SINGLE LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED AND AMIDST
SILENCE AND COMPLETE DARKNESS I FELL ASLEEP
THE NIGHT PASSED RAPIDLY
I WAS TOO TIRED EVEN TO DREAM I ONLY ONCE
AWOKE TO HEAR THE WIND RAVE IN FURIOUS GUSTS AND THE RAIN FALL IN
TORRENTS AND TO BE SENSIBLE THAT MISS MILLER HAD TAKEN HER PLACE BY MY
SIDE
WHEN I AGAIN UNCLOSED MY EYES A LOUD BELL WAS RINGING THE GIRLS
WERE UP AND DRESSING DAY HAD NOT YET BEGUN TO DAWN AND A RUSHLIGHT OR
TWO BURNED IN THE ROOM
I TOO ROSE RELUCTANTLY IT WAS BITTER COLD AND
I DRESSED AS WELL AS I COULD FOR SHIVERING AND WASHED WHEN THERE WAS A
BASIN AT LIBERTY WHICH DID NOT OCCUR SOON AS THERE WAS BUT ONE BASIN TO
SIX GIRLS ON THE STANDS DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
AGAIN THE BELL
RANG ALL FORMED IN FILE TWO AND TWO AND IN THAT ORDER DESCENDED THE
STAIRS AND ENTERED THE COLD AND DIMLY LIT SCHOOLROOM HERE PRAYERS WERE
READ BY MISS MILLER AFTERWARDS SHE CALLED OUT
FORM CLASSES
A GREAT TUMULT SUCCEEDED FOR SOME MINUTES DURING WHICH MISS MILLER
REPEATEDLY EXCLAIMED SILENCE AND ORDER WHEN IT SUBSIDED I SAW
THEM ALL DRAWN UP IN FOUR SEMICIRCLES BEFORE FOUR CHAIRS PLACED AT THE
FOUR TABLES ALL HELD BOOKS IN THEIR HANDS AND A GREAT BOOK LIKE A
BIBLE LAY ON EACH TABLE BEFORE THE VACANT SEAT
A PAUSE OF SOME
SECONDS SUCCEEDED FILLED UP BY THE LOW VAGUE HUM OF NUMBERS MISS
MILLER WALKED FROM CLASS TO CLASS HUSHING THIS INDEFINITE SOUND
A DISTANT BELL TINKLED IMMEDIATELY THREE LADIES ENTERED THE ROOM EACH
WALKED TO A TABLE AND TOOK HER SEAT
MISS MILLER ASSUMED THE FOURTH
VACANT CHAIR WHICH WAS THAT NEAREST THE DOOR AND AROUND WHICH THE
SMALLEST OF THE CHILDREN WERE ASSEMBLED TO THIS INFERIOR CLASS I WAS
CALLED AND PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
BUSINESS NOW BEGAN THE DAY'S COLLECT WAS REPEATED THEN CERTAIN TEXTS OF
SCRIPTURE WERE SAID AND TO THESE SUCCEEDED A PROTRACTED READING OF
CHAPTERS IN THE BIBLE WHICH LASTED AN HOUR
BY THE TIME THAT EXERCISE
WAS TERMINATED DAY HAD FULLY DAWNED
THE INDEFATIGABLE BELL NOW SOUNDED
FOR THE FOURTH TIME THE CLASSES WERE MARSHALLED AND MARCHED INTO ANOTHER
ROOM TO BREAKFAST HOW GLAD I WAS TO BEHOLD A PROSPECT OF GETTING
SOMETHING TO EAT I WAS NOW NEARLY SICK FROM INANITION HAVING TAKEN SO
LITTLE THE DAY BEFORE
THE REFECTORY WAS A GREAT LOW CEILED GLOOMY ROOM ON TWO LONG TABLES
SMOKED BASINS OF SOMETHING HOT WHICH HOWEVER TO MY DISMAY SENT FORTH
AN ODOUR FAR FROM INVITING
I SAW A UNIVERSAL MANIFESTATION OF
DISCONTENT WHEN THE FUMES OF THE REPAST MET THE NOSTRILS OF THOSE
DESTINED TO SWALLOW IT FROM THE VAN OF THE PROCESSION THE TALL GIRLS OF
THE FIRST CLASS ROSE THE WHISPERED WORDS
DISGUSTING THE PORRIDGE IS BURNT AGAIN
SILENCE EJACULATED A VOICE NOT THAT OF MISS MILLER BUT ONE OF THE
UPPER TEACHERS A LITTLE AND DARK PERSONAGE SMARTLY DRESSED BUT OF
SOMEWHAT MOROSE ASPECT WHO INSTALLED HERSELF AT THE TOP OF ONE TABLE
WHILE A MORE BUXOM LADY PRESIDED AT THE OTHER
I LOOKED IN VAIN FOR HER
I HAD FIRST SEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE WAS NOT VISIBLE MISS MILLER
OCCUPIED THE FOOT OF THE TABLE WHERE I SAT AND A STRANGE
FOREIGN LOOKING ELDERLY LADY THE FRENCH TEACHER AS I AFTERWARDS FOUND
TOOK THE CORRESPONDING SEAT AT THE OTHER BOARD
A LONG GRACE WAS SAID
AND A HYMN SUNG THEN A SERVANT BROUGHT IN SOME TEA FOR THE TEACHERS AND
THE MEAL BEGAN
RAVENOUS AND NOW VERY FAINT I DEVOURED A SPOONFUL OR TWO OF MY PORTION
WITHOUT THINKING OF ITS TASTE BUT THE FIRST EDGE OF HUNGER BLUNTED I
PERCEIVED I HAD GOT IN HAND A NAUSEOUS MESS BURNT PORRIDGE IS ALMOST AS
BAD AS ROTTEN POTATOES FAMINE ITSELF SOON SICKENS OVER IT
THE SPOONS
WERE MOVED SLOWLY I SAW EACH GIRL TASTE HER FOOD AND TRY TO SWALLOW IT
BUT IN MOST CASES THE EFFORT WAS SOON RELINQUISHED
BREAKFAST WAS OVER
AND NONE HAD BREAKFASTED
THANKS BEING RETURNED FOR WHAT WE HAD NOT GOT
AND A SECOND HYMN CHANTED THE REFECTORY WAS EVACUATED FOR THE
SCHOOLROOM
I WAS ONE OF THE LAST TO GO OUT AND IN PASSING THE TABLES
I SAW ONE TEACHER TAKE A BASIN OF THE PORRIDGE AND TASTE IT SHE LOOKED
AT THE OTHERS ALL THEIR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED DISPLEASURE AND ONE OF
THEM THE STOUT ONE WHISPERED
ABOMINABLE STUFF HOW SHAMEFUL
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR PASSED BEFORE LESSONS AGAIN BEGAN DURING WHICH THE
SCHOOLROOM WAS IN A GLORIOUS TUMULT FOR THAT SPACE OF TIME IT SEEMED TO
BE PERMITTED TO TALK LOUD AND MORE FREELY AND THEY USED THEIR PRIVILEGE
THE WHOLE CONVERSATION RAN ON THE BREAKFAST WHICH ONE AND ALL ABUSED
ROUNDLY
POOR THINGS IT WAS THE SOLE CONSOLATION THEY HAD
MISS MILLER
WAS NOW THE ONLY TEACHER IN THE ROOM A GROUP OF GREAT GIRLS STANDING
ABOUT HER SPOKE WITH SERIOUS AND SULLEN GESTURES
I HEARD THE NAME OF
MR
BROCKLEHURST PRONOUNCED BY SOME LIPS AT WHICH MISS MILLER SHOOK HER
HEAD DISAPPROVINGLY BUT SHE MADE NO GREAT EFFORT TO CHECK THE GENERAL
WRATH DOUBTLESS SHE SHARED IN IT
A CLOCK IN THE SCHOOLROOM STRUCK NINE MISS MILLER LEFT HER CIRCLE AND
STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM CRIED
SILENCE TO YOUR SEATS
DISCIPLINE PREVAILED IN FIVE MINUTES THE CONFUSED THRONG WAS RESOLVED
INTO ORDER AND COMPARATIVE SILENCE QUELLED THE BABEL CLAMOUR OF TONGUES
THE UPPER TEACHERS NOW PUNCTUALLY RESUMED THEIR POSTS BUT STILL ALL
SEEMED TO WAIT
RANGED ON BENCHES DOWN THE SIDES OF THE ROOM THE EIGHTY
GIRLS SAT MOTIONLESS AND ERECT A QUAINT ASSEMBLAGE THEY APPEARED ALL
WITH PLAIN LOCKS COMBED FROM THEIR FACES NOT A CURL VISIBLE IN BROWN
DRESSES MADE HIGH AND SURROUNDED BY A NARROW TUCKER ABOUT THE THROAT
WITH LITTLE POCKETS OF HOLLAND SHAPED SOMETHING LIKE A HIGHLANDER'S
PURSE TIED IN FRONT OF THEIR FROCKS AND DESTINED TO SERVE THE PURPOSE
OF A WORK BAG ALL TOO WEARING WOOLLEN STOCKINGS AND COUNTRY MADE
SHOES FASTENED WITH BRASS BUCKLES
ABOVE TWENTY OF THOSE CLAD IN THIS
COSTUME WERE FULL GROWN GIRLS OR RATHER YOUNG WOMEN IT SUITED THEM ILL
AND GAVE AN AIR OF ODDITY EVEN TO THE PRETTIEST
I WAS STILL LOOKING AT THEM AND ALSO AT INTERVALS EXAMINING THE
TEACHERS NONE OF WHOM PRECISELY PLEASED ME FOR THE STOUT ONE WAS A
LITTLE COARSE THE DARK ONE NOT A LITTLE FIERCE THE FOREIGNER HARSH AND
GROTESQUE AND MISS MILLER POOR THING LOOKED PURPLE WEATHER BEATEN
AND OVER WORKED WHEN AS MY EYE WANDERED FROM FACE TO FACE THE WHOLE
SCHOOL ROSE SIMULTANEOUSLY AS IF MOVED BY A COMMON SPRING
WHAT WAS THE MATTER I HAD HEARD NO ORDER GIVEN I WAS PUZZLED
ERE I
HAD GATHERED MY WITS THE CLASSES WERE AGAIN SEATED BUT AS ALL EYES WERE
NOW TURNED TO ONE POINT MINE FOLLOWED THE GENERAL DIRECTION AND
ENCOUNTERED THE PERSONAGE WHO HAD RECEIVED ME LAST NIGHT
SHE STOOD AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE LONG ROOM ON THE HEARTH FOR THERE WAS A FIRE AT EACH
END SHE SURVEYED THE TWO ROWS OF GIRLS SILENTLY AND GRAVELY
MISS
MILLER APPROACHING SEEMED TO ASK HER A QUESTION AND HAVING RECEIVED HER
ANSWER WENT BACK TO HER PLACE AND SAID ALOUD
MONITOR OF THE FIRST CLASS FETCH THE GLOBES
WHILE THE DIRECTION WAS BEING EXECUTED THE LADY CONSULTED MOVED SLOWLY
UP THE ROOM
I SUPPOSE I HAVE A CONSIDERABLE ORGAN OF VENERATION FOR I
RETAIN YET THE SENSE OF ADMIRING AWE WITH WHICH MY EYES TRACED HER STEPS
SEEN NOW IN BROAD DAYLIGHT SHE LOOKED TALL FAIR AND SHAPELY BROWN
EYES WITH A BENIGNANT LIGHT IN THEIR IRIDS AND A FINE PENCILLING OF LONG
LASHES ROUND RELIEVED THE WHITENESS OF HER LARGE FRONT ON EACH OF HER
TEMPLES HER HAIR OF A VERY DARK BROWN WAS CLUSTERED IN ROUND CURLS
ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THOSE TIMES WHEN NEITHER SMOOTH BANDS NOR
LONG RINGLETS WERE IN VOGUE HER DRESS ALSO IN THE MODE OF THE DAY WAS
OF PURPLE CLOTH RELIEVED BY A SORT OF SPANISH TRIMMING OF BLACK VELVET
A GOLD WATCH WATCHES WERE NOT SO COMMON THEN AS NOW SHONE AT HER
GIRDLE
LET THE READER ADD TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE REFINED FEATURES A
COMPLEXION IF PALE CLEAR AND A STATELY AIR AND CARRIAGE AND HE WILL
HAVE AT LEAST AS CLEARLY AS WORDS CAN GIVE IT A CORRECT IDEA OF THE
EXTERIOR OF MISS TEMPLE MARIA TEMPLE AS I AFTERWARDS SAW THE NAME
WRITTEN IN A PRAYER BOOK INTRUSTED TO ME TO CARRY TO CHURCH
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF LOWOOD FOR SUCH WAS THIS LADY HAVING TAKEN HER
SEAT BEFORE A PAIR OF GLOBES PLACED ON ONE OF THE TABLES SUMMONED THE
FIRST CLASS ROUND HER AND COMMENCED GIVING A LESSON ON GEOGRAPHY THE
LOWER CLASSES WERE CALLED BY THE TEACHERS REPETITIONS IN HISTORY
GRAMMAR C WENT ON FOR AN HOUR WRITING AND ARITHMETIC SUCCEEDED AND
MUSIC LESSONS WERE GIVEN BY MISS TEMPLE TO SOME OF THE ELDER GIRLS
THE
DURATION OF EACH LESSON WAS MEASURED BY THE CLOCK WHICH AT LAST STRUCK
TWELVE
THE SUPERINTENDENT ROSE
I HAVE A WORD TO ADDRESS TO THE PUPILS SAID SHE
THE TUMULT OF CESSATION FROM LESSONS WAS ALREADY BREAKING FORTH BUT IT
SANK AT HER VOICE
SHE WENT ON
YOU HAD THIS MORNING A BREAKFAST WHICH YOU COULD NOT EAT YOU MUST BE
HUNGRY I HAVE ORDERED THAT A LUNCH OF BREAD AND CHEESE SHALL BE SERVED
TO ALL
THE TEACHERS LOOKED AT HER WITH A SORT OF SURPRISE
IT IS TO BE DONE ON MY RESPONSIBILITY SHE ADDED IN AN EXPLANATORY
TONE TO THEM AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS LEFT THE ROOM
THE BREAD AND CHEESE WAS PRESENTLY BROUGHT IN AND DISTRIBUTED TO THE
HIGH DELIGHT AND REFRESHMENT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL
THE ORDER WAS NOW
GIVEN TO THE GARDEN EACH PUT ON A COARSE STRAW BONNET WITH STRINGS
OF COLOURED CALICO AND A CLOAK OF GREY FRIEZE
I WAS SIMILARLY
EQUIPPED AND FOLLOWING THE STREAM I MADE MY WAY INTO THE OPEN AIR
THE GARDEN WAS A WIDE INCLOSURE SURROUNDED WITH WALLS SO HIGH AS TO
EXCLUDE EVERY GLIMPSE OF PROSPECT A COVERED VERANDAH RAN DOWN ONE SIDE
AND BROAD WALKS BORDERED A MIDDLE SPACE DIVIDED INTO SCORES OF LITTLE
BEDS THESE BEDS WERE ASSIGNED AS GARDENS FOR THE PUPILS TO CULTIVATE
AND EACH BED HAD AN OWNER
WHEN FULL OF FLOWERS THEY WOULD DOUBTLESS
LOOK PRETTY BUT NOW AT THE LATTER END OF JANUARY ALL WAS WINTRY BLIGHT
AND BROWN DECAY
I SHUDDERED AS I STOOD AND LOOKED ROUND ME IT WAS AN
INCLEMENT DAY FOR OUTDOOR EXERCISE NOT POSITIVELY RAINY BUT DARKENED BY
A DRIZZLING YELLOW FOG ALL UNDER FOOT WAS STILL SOAKING WET WITH THE
FLOODS OF YESTERDAY
THE STRONGER AMONG THE GIRLS RAN ABOUT AND ENGAGED
IN ACTIVE GAMES BUT SUNDRY PALE AND THIN ONES HERDED TOGETHER FOR
SHELTER AND WARMTH IN THE VERANDAH AND AMONGST THESE AS THE DENSE MIST
PENETRATED TO THEIR SHIVERING FRAMES I HEARD FREQUENTLY THE SOUND OF A
HOLLOW COUGH
AS YET I HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE NOR DID ANYBODY SEEM TO TAKE NOTICE OF ME
I STOOD LONELY ENOUGH BUT TO THAT FEELING OF ISOLATION I WAS ACCUSTOMED
IT DID NOT OPPRESS ME MUCH
I LEANT AGAINST A PILLAR OF THE VERANDAH
DREW MY GREY MANTLE CLOSE ABOUT ME AND TRYING TO FORGET THE COLD WHICH
NIPPED ME WITHOUT AND THE UNSATISFIED HUNGER WHICH GNAWED ME WITHIN
DELIVERED MYSELF UP TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF WATCHING AND THINKING
MY
REFLECTIONS WERE TOO UNDEFINED AND FRAGMENTARY TO MERIT RECORD I HARDLY
YET KNEW WHERE I WAS GATESHEAD AND MY PAST LIFE SEEMED FLOATED AWAY TO
AN IMMEASURABLE DISTANCE THE PRESENT WAS VAGUE AND STRANGE AND OF THE
FUTURE I COULD FORM NO CONJECTURE
I LOOKED ROUND THE CONVENT LIKE
GARDEN AND THEN UP AT THE HOUSE A LARGE BUILDING HALF OF WHICH SEEMED
GREY AND OLD THE OTHER HALF QUITE NEW
THE NEW PART CONTAINING THE
SCHOOLROOM AND DORMITORY WAS LIT BY MULLIONED AND LATTICED WINDOWS
WHICH GAVE IT A CHURCH LIKE ASPECT A STONE TABLET OVER THE DOOR BORE
THIS INSCRIPTION
LOWOOD INSTITUTION THIS PORTION WAS REBUILT A D
BY NAOMI
BROCKLEHURST OF BROCKLEHURST HALL IN THIS COUNTY LET YOUR LIGHT SO
SHINE BEFORE MEN THAT THEY MAY SEE YOUR GOOD WORKS AND GLORIFY YOUR
FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN ST
MATT
V
16
I READ THESE WORDS OVER AND OVER AGAIN I FELT THAT AN EXPLANATION
BELONGED TO THEM AND WAS UNABLE FULLY TO PENETRATE THEIR IMPORT
I WAS
STILL PONDERING THE SIGNIFICATION OF INSTITUTION AND ENDEAVOURING TO
MAKE OUT A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FIRST WORDS AND THE VERSE OF SCRIPTURE
WHEN THE SOUND OF A COUGH CLOSE BEHIND ME MADE ME TURN MY HEAD
I SAW A
GIRL SITTING ON A STONE BENCH NEAR SHE WAS BENT OVER A BOOK ON THE
PERUSAL OF WHICH SHE SEEMED INTENT FROM WHERE I STOOD I COULD SEE THE
TITLE IT WAS RASSELAS A NAME THAT STRUCK ME AS STRANGE AND
CONSEQUENTLY ATTRACTIVE
IN TURNING A LEAF SHE HAPPENED TO LOOK UP AND
I SAID TO HER DIRECTLY
IS YOUR BOOK INTERESTING I HAD ALREADY FORMED THE INTENTION OF ASKING
HER TO LEND IT TO ME SOME DAY
I LIKE IT SHE ANSWERED AFTER A PAUSE OF A SECOND OR TWO DURING WHICH
SHE EXAMINED ME
WHAT IS IT ABOUT I CONTINUED
I HARDLY KNOW WHERE I FOUND THE
HARDIHOOD THUS TO OPEN A CONVERSATION WITH A STRANGER THE STEP WAS
CONTRARY TO MY NATURE AND HABITS BUT I THINK HER OCCUPATION TOUCHED A
CHORD OF SYMPATHY SOMEWHERE FOR I TOO LIKED READING THOUGH OF A
FRIVOLOUS AND CHILDISH KIND I COULD NOT DIGEST OR COMPREHEND THE SERIOUS
OR SUBSTANTIAL
YOU MAY LOOK AT IT REPLIED THE GIRL OFFERING ME THE BOOK
I DID SO A BRIEF EXAMINATION CONVINCED ME THAT THE CONTENTS WERE LESS
TAKING THAN THE TITLE RASSELAS LOOKED DULL TO MY TRIFLING TASTE I SAW
NOTHING ABOUT FAIRIES NOTHING ABOUT GENII NO BRIGHT VARIETY SEEMED
SPREAD OVER THE CLOSELY PRINTED PAGES
I RETURNED IT TO HER SHE
RECEIVED IT QUIETLY AND WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING SHE WAS ABOUT TO RELAPSE
INTO HER FORMER STUDIOUS MOOD AGAIN I VENTURED TO DISTURB HER
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE WRITING ON THAT STONE OVER THE DOOR MEANS WHAT
IS LOWOOD INSTITUTION
THIS HOUSE WHERE YOU ARE COME TO LIVE
AND WHY DO THEY CALL IT INSTITUTION IS IT IN ANY WAY DIFFERENT FROM
OTHER SCHOOLS
IT IS PARTLY A CHARITY SCHOOL YOU AND I AND ALL THE REST OF US ARE
CHARITY CHILDREN
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE AN ORPHAN ARE NOT EITHER YOUR
FATHER OR YOUR MOTHER DEAD
BOTH DIED BEFORE I CAN REMEMBER
WELL ALL THE GIRLS HERE HAVE LOST EITHER ONE OR BOTH PARENTS AND THIS
IS CALLED AN INSTITUTION FOR EDUCATING ORPHANS
DO WE PAY NO MONEY DO THEY KEEP US FOR NOTHING
WE PAY OR OUR FRIENDS PAY FIFTEEN POUNDS A YEAR FOR EACH
THEN WHY DO THEY CALL US CHARITY CHILDREN
BECAUSE FIFTEEN POUNDS IS NOT ENOUGH FOR BOARD AND TEACHING AND THE
DEFICIENCY IS SUPPLIED BY SUBSCRIPTION
WHO SUBSCRIBES
DIFFERENT BENEVOLENT MINDED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
AND IN LONDON
WHO WAS NAOMI BROCKLEHURST
THE LADY WHO BUILT THE NEW PART OF THIS HOUSE AS THAT TABLET RECORDS
AND WHOSE SON OVERLOOKS AND DIRECTS EVERYTHING HERE
WHY
BECAUSE HE IS TREASURER AND MANAGER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
THEN THIS HOUSE DOES NOT BELONG TO THAT TALL LADY WHO WEARS A WATCH AND
WHO SAID WE WERE TO HAVE SOME BREAD AND CHEESE
TO MISS TEMPLE OH NO I WISH IT DID SHE HAS TO ANSWER TO MR
BROCKLEHURST FOR ALL SHE DOES
MR
BROCKLEHURST BUYS ALL OUR FOOD AND
ALL OUR CLOTHES
DOES HE LIVE HERE
NO TWO MILES OFF AT A LARGE HALL
IS HE A GOOD MAN
HE IS A CLERGYMAN AND IS SAID TO DO A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD
DID YOU SAY THAT TALL LADY WAS CALLED MISS TEMPLE
YES
AND WHAT ARE THE OTHER TEACHERS CALLED
THE ONE WITH RED CHEEKS IS CALLED MISS SMITH SHE ATTENDS TO THE WORK
AND CUTS OUT FOR WE MAKE OUR OWN CLOTHES OUR FROCKS AND PELISSES AND
EVERYTHING THE LITTLE ONE WITH BLACK HAIR IS MISS SCATCHERD SHE TEACHES
HISTORY AND GRAMMAR AND HEARS THE SECOND CLASS REPETITIONS AND THE ONE
WHO WEARS A SHAWL AND HAS A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF TIED TO HER SIDE WITH A
YELLOW RIBBAND IS MADAME PIERROT SHE COMES FROM LISLE IN FRANCE AND
TEACHES FRENCH
DO YOU LIKE THE TEACHERS
WELL ENOUGH
DO YOU LIKE THE LITTLE BLACK ONE AND THE MADAME I CANNOT
PRONOUNCE HER NAME AS YOU DO
MISS SCATCHERD IS HASTY YOU MUST TAKE CARE NOT TO OFFEND HER MADAME
PIERROT IS NOT A BAD SORT OF PERSON
BUT MISS TEMPLE IS THE BEST ISN'T SHE
MISS TEMPLE IS VERY GOOD AND VERY CLEVER SHE IS ABOVE THE REST BECAUSE
SHE KNOWS FAR MORE THAN THEY DO
HAVE YOU BEEN LONG HERE
TWO YEARS
ARE YOU AN ORPHAN
MY MOTHER IS DEAD
ARE YOU HAPPY HERE
YOU ASK RATHER TOO MANY QUESTIONS
I HAVE GIVEN YOU ANSWERS ENOUGH FOR
THE PRESENT NOW I WANT TO READ
BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE SUMMONS SOUNDED FOR DINNER ALL RE ENTERED THE
HOUSE
THE ODOUR WHICH NOW FILLED THE REFECTORY WAS SCARCELY MORE
APPETISING THAN THAT WHICH HAD REGALED OUR NOSTRILS AT BREAKFAST THE
DINNER WAS SERVED IN TWO HUGE TIN PLATED VESSELS WHENCE ROSE A STRONG
STEAM REDOLENT OF RANCID FAT
I FOUND THE MESS TO CONSIST OF INDIFFERENT
POTATOES AND STRANGE SHREDS OF RUSTY MEAT MIXED AND COOKED TOGETHER
OF
THIS PREPARATION A TOLERABLY ABUNDANT PLATEFUL WAS APPORTIONED TO EACH
PUPIL
I ATE WHAT I COULD AND WONDERED WITHIN MYSELF WHETHER EVERY
DAY'S FARE WOULD BE LIKE THIS
AFTER DINNER WE IMMEDIATELY ADJOURNED TO THE SCHOOLROOM LESSONS
RECOMMENCED AND WERE CONTINUED TILL FIVE O'CLOCK
THE ONLY MARKED EVENT OF THE AFTERNOON WAS THAT I SAW THE GIRL WITH WHOM
I HAD CONVERSED IN THE VERANDAH DISMISSED IN DISGRACE BY MISS SCATCHERD
FROM A HISTORY CLASS AND SENT TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LARGE
SCHOOLROOM
THE PUNISHMENT SEEMED TO ME IN A HIGH DEGREE IGNOMINIOUS
ESPECIALLY FOR SO GREAT A GIRL SHE LOOKED THIRTEEN OR UPWARDS
I
EXPECTED SHE WOULD SHOW SIGNS OF GREAT DISTRESS AND SHAME BUT TO MY
SURPRISE SHE NEITHER WEPT NOR BLUSHED COMPOSED THOUGH GRAVE SHE STOOD
THE CENTRAL MARK OF ALL EYES
HOW CAN SHE BEAR IT SO QUIETLY SO
FIRMLY I ASKED OF MYSELF
WERE I IN HER PLACE IT SEEMS TO ME I
SHOULD WISH THE EARTH TO OPEN AND SWALLOW ME UP
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE
WERE THINKING OF SOMETHING BEYOND HER PUNISHMENT BEYOND HER SITUATION
OF SOMETHING NOT ROUND HER NOR BEFORE HER
I HAVE HEARD OF DAY DREAMS IS
SHE IN A DAY DREAM NOW HER EYES ARE FIXED ON THE FLOOR BUT I AM SURE
THEY DO NOT SEE IT HER SIGHT SEEMS TURNED IN GONE DOWN INTO HER HEART
SHE IS LOOKING AT WHAT SHE CAN REMEMBER I BELIEVE NOT AT WHAT IS REALLY
PRESENT
I WONDER WHAT SORT OF A GIRL SHE IS WHETHER GOOD OR NAUGHTY
SOON AFTER FIVE P M
WE HAD ANOTHER MEAL CONSISTING OF A SMALL MUG OF
COFFEE AND HALF A SLICE OF BROWN BREAD
I DEVOURED MY BREAD AND DRANK
MY COFFEE WITH RELISH BUT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD OF AS MUCH MORE I WAS
STILL HUNGRY
HALF AN HOUR'S RECREATION SUCCEEDED THEN STUDY THEN THE
GLASS OF WATER AND THE PIECE OF OAT CAKE PRAYERS AND BED
SUCH WAS MY
FIRST DAY AT LOWOOD
CHAPTER VI
THE NEXT DAY COMMENCED AS BEFORE GETTING UP AND DRESSING BY RUSHLIGHT
BUT THIS MORNING WE WERE OBLIGED TO DISPENSE WITH THE CEREMONY OF
WASHING THE WATER IN THE PITCHERS WAS FROZEN
A CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
IN THE WEATHER THE PRECEDING EVENING AND A KEEN NORTH EAST WIND
WHISTLING THROUGH THE CREVICES OF OUR BEDROOM WINDOWS ALL NIGHT LONG HAD
MADE US SHIVER IN OUR BEDS AND TURNED THE CONTENTS OF THE EWERS TO ICE
BEFORE THE LONG HOUR AND A HALF OF PRAYERS AND BIBLE READING WAS OVER I
FELT READY TO PERISH WITH COLD
BREAKFAST TIME CAME AT LAST AND THIS
MORNING THE PORRIDGE WAS NOT BURNT THE QUALITY WAS EATABLE THE QUANTITY
SMALL
HOW SMALL MY PORTION SEEMED I WISHED IT HAD BEEN DOUBLED
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I WAS ENROLLED A MEMBER OF THE FOURTH CLASS AND
REGULAR TASKS AND OCCUPATIONS WERE ASSIGNED ME HITHERTO I HAD ONLY BEEN
A SPECTATOR OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT LOWOOD I WAS NOW TO BECOME AN ACTOR
THEREIN
AT FIRST BEING LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO LEARN BY HEART THE
LESSONS APPEARED TO ME BOTH LONG AND DIFFICULT THE FREQUENT CHANGE FROM
TASK TO TASK TOO BEWILDERED ME AND I WAS GLAD WHEN ABOUT THREE
O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON MISS SMITH PUT INTO MY HANDS A BORDER OF MUSLIN
TWO YARDS LONG TOGETHER WITH NEEDLE THIMBLE C AND SENT ME TO SIT IN
A QUIET CORNER OF THE SCHOOLROOM WITH DIRECTIONS TO HEM THE SAME
AT
THAT HOUR MOST OF THE OTHERS WERE SEWING LIKEWISE BUT ONE CLASS STILL
STOOD ROUND MISS SCATCHERD'S CHAIR READING AND AS ALL WAS QUIET THE
SUBJECT OF THEIR LESSONS COULD BE HEARD TOGETHER WITH THE MANNER IN
WHICH EACH GIRL ACQUITTED HERSELF AND THE ANIMADVERSIONS OR
COMMENDATIONS OF MISS SCATCHERD ON THE PERFORMANCE
IT WAS ENGLISH
HISTORY AMONG THE READERS I OBSERVED MY ACQUAINTANCE OF THE VERANDAH AT
THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE LESSON HER PLACE HAD BEEN AT THE TOP OF THE
CLASS BUT FOR SOME ERROR OF PRONUNCIATION OR SOME INATTENTION TO STOPS
SHE WAS SUDDENLY SENT TO THE VERY BOTTOM
EVEN IN THAT OBSCURE POSITION
MISS SCATCHERD CONTINUED TO MAKE HER AN OBJECT OF CONSTANT NOTICE SHE
WAS CONTINUALLY ADDRESSING TO HER SUCH PHRASES AS THE FOLLOWING
BURNS SUCH IT SEEMS WAS HER NAME THE GIRLS HERE WERE ALL CALLED BY
THEIR SURNAMES AS BOYS ARE ELSEWHERE BURNS YOU ARE STANDING ON THE
SIDE OF YOUR SHOE TURN YOUR TOES OUT IMMEDIATELY BURNS YOU POKE
YOUR CHIN MOST UNPLEASANTLY DRAW IT IN BURNS I INSIST ON YOUR
HOLDING YOUR HEAD UP I WILL NOT HAVE YOU BEFORE ME IN THAT ATTITUDE
C
C
A CHAPTER HAVING BEEN READ THROUGH TWICE THE BOOKS WERE CLOSED AND THE
GIRLS EXAMINED
THE LESSON HAD COMPRISED PART OF THE REIGN OF CHARLES
I AND THERE WERE SUNDRY QUESTIONS ABOUT TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE AND SHIP
MONEY WHICH MOST OF THEM APPEARED UNABLE TO ANSWER STILL EVERY LITTLE
DIFFICULTY WAS SOLVED INSTANTLY WHEN IT REACHED BURNS HER MEMORY SEEMED
TO HAVE RETAINED THE SUBSTANCE OF THE WHOLE LESSON AND SHE WAS READY
WITH ANSWERS ON EVERY POINT
I KEPT EXPECTING THAT MISS SCATCHERD WOULD
PRAISE HER ATTENTION BUT INSTEAD OF THAT SHE SUDDENLY CRIED OUT
YOU DIRTY DISAGREEABLE GIRL YOU HAVE NEVER CLEANED YOUR NAILS THIS
MORNING
BURNS MADE NO ANSWER I WONDERED AT HER SILENCE
WHY THOUGHT I DOES
SHE NOT EXPLAIN THAT SHE COULD NEITHER CLEAN HER NAILS NOR WASH HER FACE
AS THE WATER WAS FROZEN
MY ATTENTION WAS NOW CALLED OFF BY MISS SMITH DESIRING ME TO HOLD A SKEIN
OF THREAD WHILE SHE WAS WINDING IT SHE TALKED TO ME FROM TIME TO TIME
ASKING WHETHER I HAD EVER BEEN AT SCHOOL BEFORE WHETHER I COULD MARK
STITCH KNIT C TILL SHE DISMISSED ME I COULD NOT PURSUE MY
OBSERVATIONS ON MISS SCATCHERD'S MOVEMENTS
WHEN I RETURNED TO MY SEAT
THAT LADY WAS JUST DELIVERING AN ORDER OF WHICH I DID NOT CATCH THE
IMPORT BUT BURNS IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE CLASS AND GOING INTO THE SMALL
INNER ROOM WHERE THE BOOKS WERE KEPT RETURNED IN HALF A MINUTE CARRYING
IN HER HAND A BUNDLE OF TWIGS TIED TOGETHER AT ONE END
THIS OMINOUS
TOOL SHE PRESENTED TO MISS SCATCHERD WITH A RESPECTFUL CURTESY THEN SHE
QUIETLY AND WITHOUT BEING TOLD UNLOOSED HER PINAFORE AND THE TEACHER
INSTANTLY AND SHARPLY INFLICTED ON HER NECK A DOZEN STROKES WITH THE
BUNCH OF TWIGS
NOT A TEAR ROSE TO BURNS' EYE AND WHILE I PAUSED FROM
MY SEWING BECAUSE MY FINGERS QUIVERED AT THIS SPECTACLE WITH A SENTIMENT
OF UNAVAILING AND IMPOTENT ANGER NOT A FEATURE OF HER PENSIVE FACE
ALTERED ITS ORDINARY EXPRESSION
HARDENED GIRL EXCLAIMED MISS SCATCHERD NOTHING CAN CORRECT YOU OF
YOUR SLATTERNLY HABITS CARRY THE ROD AWAY
BURNS OBEYED I LOOKED AT HER NARROWLY AS SHE EMERGED FROM THE
BOOK CLOSET SHE WAS JUST PUTTING BACK HER HANDKERCHIEF INTO HER POCKET
AND THE TRACE OF A TEAR GLISTENED ON HER THIN CHEEK
THE PLAY HOUR IN THE EVENING I THOUGHT THE PLEASANTEST FRACTION OF THE
DAY AT LOWOOD THE BIT OF BREAD THE DRAUGHT OF COFFEE SWALLOWED AT FIVE
O'CLOCK HAD REVIVED VITALITY IF IT HAD NOT SATISFIED HUNGER THE LONG
RESTRAINT OF THE DAY WAS SLACKENED THE SCHOOLROOM FELT WARMER THAN IN
THE MORNING ITS FIRES BEING ALLOWED TO BURN A LITTLE MORE BRIGHTLY TO
SUPPLY IN SOME MEASURE THE PLACE OF CANDLES NOT YET INTRODUCED THE
RUDDY GLOAMING THE LICENSED UPROAR THE CONFUSION OF MANY VOICES GAVE
ONE A WELCOME SENSE OF LIBERTY
ON THE EVENING OF THE DAY ON WHICH I HAD SEEN MISS SCATCHERD FLOG HER
PUPIL BURNS I WANDERED AS USUAL AMONG THE FORMS AND TABLES AND LAUGHING
GROUPS WITHOUT A COMPANION YET NOT FEELING LONELY WHEN I PASSED THE
WINDOWS I NOW AND THEN LIFTED A BLIND AND LOOKED OUT IT SNOWED FAST A
DRIFT WAS ALREADY FORMING AGAINST THE LOWER PANES PUTTING MY EAR CLOSE
TO THE WINDOW I COULD DISTINGUISH FROM THE GLEEFUL TUMULT WITHIN THE
DISCONSOLATE MOAN OF THE WIND OUTSIDE
PROBABLY IF I HAD LATELY LEFT A GOOD HOME AND KIND PARENTS THIS WOULD
HAVE BEEN THE HOUR WHEN I SHOULD MOST KEENLY HAVE REGRETTED THE
SEPARATION THAT WIND WOULD THEN HAVE SADDENED MY HEART THIS OBSCURE
CHAOS WOULD HAVE DISTURBED MY PEACE AS IT WAS I DERIVED FROM BOTH A
STRANGE EXCITEMENT AND RECKLESS AND FEVERISH I WISHED THE WIND TO HOWL
MORE WILDLY THE GLOOM TO DEEPEN TO DARKNESS AND THE CONFUSION TO RISE
TO CLAMOUR
JUMPING OVER FORMS AND CREEPING UNDER TABLES I MADE MY WAY TO ONE OF
THE FIRE PLACES THERE KNEELING BY THE HIGH WIRE FENDER I FOUND BURNS
ABSORBED SILENT ABSTRACTED FROM ALL ROUND HER BY THE COMPANIONSHIP OF A
BOOK WHICH SHE READ BY THE DIM GLARE OF THE EMBERS
IS IT STILL 'RASSELAS' I ASKED COMING BEHIND HER
YES SHE SAID AND I HAVE JUST FINISHED IT
AND IN FIVE MINUTES MORE SHE SHUT IT UP
I WAS GLAD OF THIS
NOW
THOUGHT I I CAN PERHAPS GET HER TO TALK I SAT DOWN BY HER ON THE
FLOOR
WHAT IS YOUR NAME BESIDES BURNS
HELEN
DO YOU COME A LONG WAY FROM HERE
I COME FROM A PLACE FARTHER NORTH QUITE ON THE BORDERS OF SCOTLAND
WILL YOU EVER GO BACK
I HOPE SO BUT NOBODY CAN BE SURE OF THE FUTURE
YOU MUST WISH TO LEAVE LOWOOD
NO WHY SHOULD I I WAS SENT TO LOWOOD TO GET AN EDUCATION AND IT
WOULD BE OF NO USE GOING AWAY UNTIL I HAVE ATTAINED THAT OBJECT
BUT THAT TEACHER MISS SCATCHERD IS SO CRUEL TO YOU
CRUEL NOT AT ALL SHE IS SEVERE SHE DISLIKES MY FAULTS
AND IF I WERE IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD DISLIKE HER I SHOULD RESIST HER
IF SHE STRUCK ME WITH THAT ROD I SHOULD GET IT FROM HER HAND I SHOULD
BREAK IT UNDER HER NOSE
PROBABLY YOU WOULD DO NOTHING OF THE SORT BUT IF YOU DID MR
BROCKLEHURST WOULD EXPEL YOU FROM THE SCHOOL THAT WOULD BE A GREAT GRIEF
TO YOUR RELATIONS
IT IS FAR BETTER TO ENDURE PATIENTLY A SMART WHICH
NOBODY FEELS BUT YOURSELF THAN TO COMMIT A HASTY ACTION WHOSE EVIL
CONSEQUENCES WILL EXTEND TO ALL CONNECTED WITH YOU AND BESIDES THE
BIBLE BIDS US RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL
BUT THEN IT SEEMS DISGRACEFUL TO BE FLOGGED AND TO BE SENT TO STAND IN
THE MIDDLE OF A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE AND YOU ARE SUCH A GREAT GIRL I AM
FAR YOUNGER THAN YOU AND I COULD NOT BEAR IT
YET IT WOULD BE YOUR DUTY TO BEAR IT IF YOU COULD NOT AVOID IT IT IS
WEAK AND SILLY TO SAY YOU CANNOT BEAR WHAT IT IS YOUR FATE TO BE
REQUIRED TO BEAR
I HEARD HER WITH WONDER I COULD NOT COMPREHEND THIS DOCTRINE OF
ENDURANCE AND STILL LESS COULD I UNDERSTAND OR SYMPATHISE WITH THE
FORBEARANCE SHE EXPRESSED FOR HER CHASTISER
STILL I FELT THAT HELEN
BURNS CONSIDERED THINGS BY A LIGHT INVISIBLE TO MY EYES
I SUSPECTED SHE
MIGHT BE RIGHT AND I WRONG BUT I WOULD NOT PONDER THE MATTER DEEPLY
LIKE FELIX I PUT IT OFF TO A MORE CONVENIENT SEASON
YOU SAY YOU HAVE FAULTS HELEN WHAT ARE THEY TO ME YOU SEEM VERY
GOOD
THEN LEARN FROM ME NOT TO JUDGE BY APPEARANCES I AM AS MISS SCATCHERD
SAID SLATTERNLY I SELDOM PUT AND NEVER KEEP THINGS IN ORDER I AM
CARELESS I FORGET RULES I READ WHEN I SHOULD LEARN MY LESSONS I HAVE
NO METHOD AND SOMETIMES I SAY LIKE YOU I CANNOT BEAR TO BE SUBJECTED
TO SYSTEMATIC ARRANGEMENTS
THIS IS ALL VERY PROVOKING TO MISS
SCATCHERD WHO IS NATURALLY NEAT PUNCTUAL AND PARTICULAR
AND CROSS AND CRUEL I ADDED BUT HELEN BURNS WOULD NOT ADMIT MY
ADDITION SHE KEPT SILENCE
IS MISS TEMPLE AS SEVERE TO YOU AS MISS SCATCHERD
AT THE UTTERANCE OF MISS TEMPLE'S NAME A SOFT SMILE FLITTED OVER HER
GRAVE FACE
MISS TEMPLE IS FULL OF GOODNESS IT PAINS HER TO BE SEVERE TO ANY ONE
EVEN THE WORST IN THE SCHOOL SHE SEES MY ERRORS AND TELLS ME OF THEM
GENTLY AND IF I DO ANYTHING WORTHY OF PRAISE SHE GIVES ME MY MEED
LIBERALLY
ONE STRONG PROOF OF MY WRETCHEDLY DEFECTIVE NATURE IS THAT
EVEN HER EXPOSTULATIONS SO MILD SO RATIONAL HAVE NOT INFLUENCE TO CURE
ME OF MY FAULTS AND EVEN HER PRAISE THOUGH I VALUE IT MOST HIGHLY
CANNOT STIMULATE ME TO CONTINUED CARE AND FORESIGHT
THAT IS CURIOUS SAID I IT IS SO EASY TO BE CAREFUL
FOR YOU I HAVE NO DOUBT IT IS
I OBSERVED YOU IN YOUR CLASS THIS
MORNING AND SAW YOU WERE CLOSELY ATTENTIVE YOUR THOUGHTS NEVER SEEMED
TO WANDER WHILE MISS MILLER EXPLAINED THE LESSON AND QUESTIONED YOU
NOW
MINE CONTINUALLY ROVE AWAY WHEN I SHOULD BE LISTENING TO MISS SCATCHERD
AND COLLECTING ALL SHE SAYS WITH ASSIDUITY OFTEN I LOSE THE VERY SOUND
OF HER VOICE I FALL INTO A SORT OF DREAM
SOMETIMES I THINK I AM IN
NORTHUMBERLAND AND THAT THE NOISES I HEAR ROUND ME ARE THE BUBBLING OF A
LITTLE BROOK WHICH RUNS THROUGH DEEPDEN NEAR OUR HOUSE THEN WHEN IT
COMES TO MY TURN TO REPLY I HAVE TO BE AWAKENED AND HAVING HEARD
NOTHING OF WHAT WAS READ FOR LISTENING TO THE VISIONARY BROOK I HAVE NO
ANSWER READY
YET HOW WELL YOU REPLIED THIS AFTERNOON
IT WAS MERE CHANCE THE SUBJECT ON WHICH WE HAD BEEN READING HAD
INTERESTED ME
THIS AFTERNOON INSTEAD OF DREAMING OF DEEPDEN I WAS
WONDERING HOW A MAN WHO WISHED TO DO RIGHT COULD ACT SO UNJUSTLY AND
UNWISELY AS CHARLES THE FIRST SOMETIMES DID AND I THOUGHT WHAT A PITY IT
WAS THAT WITH HIS INTEGRITY AND CONSCIENTIOUSNESS HE COULD SEE NO
FARTHER THAN THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN
IF HE HAD BUT BEEN ABLE TO
LOOK TO A DISTANCE AND SEE HOW WHAT THEY CALL THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE WAS
TENDING STILL I LIKE CHARLES I RESPECT HIM I PITY HIM POOR MURDERED
KING YES HIS ENEMIES WERE THE WORST THEY SHED BLOOD THEY HAD NO RIGHT
TO SHED
HOW DARED THEY KILL HIM
HELEN WAS TALKING TO HERSELF NOW SHE HAD FORGOTTEN I COULD NOT VERY WELL
UNDERSTAND HER THAT I WAS IGNORANT OR NEARLY SO OF THE SUBJECT SHE
DISCUSSED
I RECALLED HER TO MY LEVEL
AND WHEN MISS TEMPLE TEACHES YOU DO YOUR THOUGHTS WANDER THEN
NO CERTAINLY NOT OFTEN BECAUSE MISS TEMPLE HAS GENERALLY SOMETHING TO
SAY WHICH IS NEWER THAN MY OWN REFLECTIONS HER LANGUAGE IS SINGULARLY
AGREEABLE TO ME AND THE INFORMATION SHE COMMUNICATES IS OFTEN JUST WHAT
I WISHED TO GAIN
WELL THEN WITH MISS TEMPLE YOU ARE GOOD
YES IN A PASSIVE WAY I MAKE NO EFFORT I FOLLOW AS INCLINATION GUIDES
ME
THERE IS NO MERIT IN SUCH GOODNESS
A GREAT DEAL YOU ARE GOOD TO THOSE WHO ARE GOOD TO YOU
IT IS ALL I
EVER DESIRE TO BE
IF PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS KIND AND OBEDIENT TO THOSE WHO
ARE CRUEL AND UNJUST THE WICKED PEOPLE WOULD HAVE IT ALL THEIR OWN WAY
THEY WOULD NEVER FEEL AFRAID AND SO THEY WOULD NEVER ALTER BUT WOULD
GROW WORSE AND WORSE
WHEN WE ARE STRUCK AT WITHOUT A REASON WE SHOULD
STRIKE BACK AGAIN VERY HARD I AM SURE WE SHOULD SO HARD AS TO TEACH THE
PERSON WHO STRUCK US NEVER TO DO IT AGAIN
YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND I HOPE WHEN YOU GROW OLDER AS YET YOU ARE
BUT A LITTLE UNTAUGHT GIRL
BUT I FEEL THIS HELEN I MUST DISLIKE THOSE WHO WHATEVER I DO TO
PLEASE THEM PERSIST IN DISLIKING ME I MUST RESIST THOSE WHO PUNISH ME
UNJUSTLY
IT IS AS NATURAL AS THAT I SHOULD LOVE THOSE WHO SHOW ME
AFFECTION OR SUBMIT TO PUNISHMENT WHEN I FEEL IT IS DESERVED
HEATHENS AND SAVAGE TRIBES HOLD THAT DOCTRINE BUT CHRISTIANS AND
CIVILISED NATIONS DISOWN IT
HOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IT IS NOT VIOLENCE THAT BEST OVERCOMES HATE NOR VENGEANCE THAT MOST
CERTAINLY HEALS INJURY
WHAT THEN
READ THE NEW TESTAMENT AND OBSERVE WHAT CHRIST SAYS AND HOW HE ACTS
MAKE HIS WORD YOUR RULE AND HIS CONDUCT YOUR EXAMPLE
WHAT DOES HE SAY
LOVE YOUR ENEMIES BLESS THEM THAT CURSE YOU DO GOOD TO THEM THAT HATE
YOU AND DESPITEFULLY USE YOU
THEN I SHOULD LOVE MRS
REED WHICH I CANNOT DO I SHOULD BLESS HER SON
JOHN WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE
IN HER TURN HELEN BURNS ASKED ME TO EXPLAIN AND I PROCEEDED FORTHWITH
TO POUR OUT IN MY OWN WAY THE TALE OF MY SUFFERINGS AND RESENTMENTS
BITTER AND TRUCULENT WHEN EXCITED I SPOKE AS I FELT WITHOUT RESERVE OR
SOFTENING
HELEN HEARD ME PATIENTLY TO THE END I EXPECTED SHE WOULD THEN MAKE A
REMARK BUT SHE SAID NOTHING
WELL I ASKED IMPATIENTLY IS NOT MRS
REED A HARD HEARTED BAD
WOMAN
SHE HAS BEEN UNKIND TO YOU NO DOUBT BECAUSE YOU SEE SHE DISLIKES YOUR
CAST OF CHARACTER AS MISS SCATCHERD DOES MINE BUT HOW MINUTELY YOU
REMEMBER ALL SHE HAS DONE AND SAID TO YOU WHAT A SINGULARLY DEEP
IMPRESSION HER INJUSTICE SEEMS TO HAVE MADE ON YOUR HEART NO ILL USAGE
SO BRANDS ITS RECORD ON MY FEELINGS
WOULD YOU NOT BE HAPPIER IF YOU
TRIED TO FORGET HER SEVERITY TOGETHER WITH THE PASSIONATE EMOTIONS IT
EXCITED LIFE APPEARS TO ME TOO SHORT TO BE SPENT IN NURSING ANIMOSITY
OR REGISTERING WRONGS
WE ARE AND MUST BE ONE AND ALL BURDENED WITH
FAULTS IN THIS WORLD BUT THE TIME WILL SOON COME WHEN I TRUST WE SHALL
PUT THEM OFF IN PUTTING OFF OUR CORRUPTIBLE BODIES WHEN DEBASEMENT AND
SIN WILL FALL FROM US WITH THIS CUMBROUS FRAME OF FLESH AND ONLY THE
SPARK OF THE SPIRIT WILL REMAIN THE IMPALPABLE PRINCIPLE OF LIGHT AND
THOUGHT PURE AS WHEN IT LEFT THE CREATOR TO INSPIRE THE CREATURE WHENCE
IT CAME IT WILL RETURN PERHAPS AGAIN TO BE COMMUNICATED TO SOME BEING
HIGHER THAN MAN PERHAPS TO PASS THROUGH GRADATIONS OF GLORY FROM THE
PALE HUMAN SOUL TO BRIGHTEN TO THE SERAPH SURELY IT WILL NEVER ON THE
CONTRARY BE SUFFERED TO DEGENERATE FROM MAN TO FIEND NO I CANNOT
BELIEVE THAT I HOLD ANOTHER CREED WHICH NO ONE EVER TAUGHT ME AND
WHICH I SELDOM MENTION BUT IN WHICH I DELIGHT AND TO WHICH I CLING FOR
IT EXTENDS HOPE TO ALL IT MAKES ETERNITY A REST A MIGHTY HOME NOT A
TERROR AND AN ABYSS
BESIDES WITH THIS CREED I CAN SO CLEARLY
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE CRIMINAL AND HIS CRIME I CAN SO SINCERELY
FORGIVE THE FIRST WHILE I ABHOR THE LAST WITH THIS CREED REVENGE NEVER
WORRIES MY HEART DEGRADATION NEVER TOO DEEPLY DISGUSTS ME INJUSTICE
NEVER CRUSHES ME TOO LOW I LIVE IN CALM LOOKING TO THE END
HELEN'S HEAD ALWAYS DROOPING SANK A LITTLE LOWER AS SHE FINISHED THIS
SENTENCE
I SAW BY HER LOOK SHE WISHED NO LONGER TO TALK TO ME BUT
RATHER TO CONVERSE WITH HER OWN THOUGHTS
SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED MUCH TIME
FOR MEDITATION A MONITOR A GREAT ROUGH GIRL PRESENTLY CAME UP
EXCLAIMING IN A STRONG CUMBERLAND ACCENT
HELEN BURNS IF YOU DON'T GO AND PUT YOUR DRAWER IN ORDER AND FOLD UP
YOUR WORK THIS MINUTE I'LL TELL MISS SCATCHERD TO COME AND LOOK AT IT
HELEN SIGHED AS HER REVERIE FLED AND GETTING UP OBEYED THE MONITOR
WITHOUT REPLY AS WITHOUT DELAY
CHAPTER VII
MY FIRST QUARTER AT LOWOOD SEEMED AN AGE AND NOT THE GOLDEN AGE EITHER
IT COMPRISED AN IRKSOME STRUGGLE WITH DIFFICULTIES IN HABITUATING MYSELF
TO NEW RULES AND UNWONTED TASKS
THE FEAR OF FAILURE IN THESE POINTS
HARASSED ME WORSE THAN THE PHYSICAL HARDSHIPS OF MY LOT THOUGH THESE
WERE NO TRIFLES
DURING JANUARY FEBRUARY AND PART OF MARCH THE DEEP SNOWS AND AFTER
THEIR MELTING THE ALMOST IMPASSABLE ROADS PREVENTED OUR STIRRING BEYOND
THE GARDEN WALLS EXCEPT TO GO TO CHURCH BUT WITHIN THESE LIMITS WE HAD
TO PASS AN HOUR EVERY DAY IN THE OPEN AIR
OUR CLOTHING WAS INSUFFICIENT
TO PROTECT US FROM THE SEVERE COLD WE HAD NO BOOTS THE SNOW GOT INTO
OUR SHOES AND MELTED THERE OUR UNGLOVED HANDS BECAME NUMBED AND COVERED
WITH CHILBLAINS AS WERE OUR FEET I REMEMBER WELL THE DISTRACTING
IRRITATION I ENDURED FROM THIS CAUSE EVERY EVENING WHEN MY FEET
INFLAMED AND THE TORTURE OF THRUSTING THE SWELLED RAW AND STIFF TOES
INTO MY SHOES IN THE MORNING
THEN THE SCANTY SUPPLY OF FOOD WAS
DISTRESSING WITH THE KEEN APPETITES OF GROWING CHILDREN WE HAD SCARCELY
SUFFICIENT TO KEEP ALIVE A DELICATE INVALID
FROM THIS DEFICIENCY OF
NOURISHMENT RESULTED AN ABUSE WHICH PRESSED HARDLY ON THE YOUNGER
PUPILS WHENEVER THE FAMISHED GREAT GIRLS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY THEY WOULD
COAX OR MENACE THE LITTLE ONES OUT OF THEIR PORTION
MANY A TIME I HAVE
SHARED BETWEEN TWO CLAIMANTS THE PRECIOUS MORSEL OF BROWN BREAD
DISTRIBUTED AT TEA TIME AND AFTER RELINQUISHING TO A THIRD HALF THE
CONTENTS OF MY MUG OF COFFEE I HAVE SWALLOWED THE REMAINDER WITH AN
ACCOMPANIMENT OF SECRET TEARS FORCED FROM ME BY THE EXIGENCY OF HUNGER
SUNDAYS WERE DREARY DAYS IN THAT WINTRY SEASON
WE HAD TO WALK TWO MILES
TO BROCKLEBRIDGE CHURCH WHERE OUR PATRON OFFICIATED
WE SET OUT COLD
WE ARRIVED AT CHURCH COLDER DURING THE MORNING SERVICE WE BECAME ALMOST
PARALYSED
IT WAS TOO FAR TO RETURN TO DINNER AND AN ALLOWANCE OF COLD
MEAT AND BREAD IN THE SAME PENURIOUS PROPORTION OBSERVED IN OUR ORDINARY
MEALS WAS SERVED ROUND BETWEEN THE SERVICES
AT THE CLOSE OF THE AFTERNOON SERVICE WE RETURNED BY AN EXPOSED AND HILLY
ROAD WHERE THE BITTER WINTER WIND BLOWING OVER A RANGE OF SNOWY SUMMITS
TO THE NORTH ALMOST FLAYED THE SKIN FROM OUR FACES
I CAN REMEMBER MISS TEMPLE WALKING LIGHTLY AND RAPIDLY ALONG OUR DROOPING
LINE HER PLAID CLOAK WHICH THE FROSTY WIND FLUTTERED GATHERED CLOSE
ABOUT HER AND ENCOURAGING US BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE TO KEEP UP OUR
SPIRITS AND MARCH FORWARD AS SHE SAID LIKE STALWART SOLDIERS THE
OTHER TEACHERS POOR THINGS WERE GENERALLY THEMSELVES TOO MUCH DEJECTED
TO ATTEMPT THE TASK OF CHEERING OTHERS
HOW WE LONGED FOR THE LIGHT AND HEAT OF A BLAZING FIRE WHEN WE GOT BACK
BUT TO THE LITTLE ONES AT LEAST THIS WAS DENIED EACH HEARTH IN THE
SCHOOLROOM WAS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY A DOUBLE ROW OF GREAT GIRLS AND
BEHIND THEM THE YOUNGER CHILDREN CROUCHED IN GROUPS WRAPPING THEIR
STARVED ARMS IN THEIR PINAFORES
A LITTLE SOLACE CAME AT TEA TIME IN THE SHAPE OF A DOUBLE RATION OF
BREAD A WHOLE INSTEAD OF A HALF SLICE WITH THE DELICIOUS ADDITION OF
A THIN SCRAPE OF BUTTER IT WAS THE HEBDOMADAL TREAT TO WHICH WE ALL
LOOKED FORWARD FROM SABBATH TO SABBATH
I GENERALLY CONTRIVED TO RESERVE
A MOIETY OF THIS BOUNTEOUS REPAST FOR MYSELF BUT THE REMAINDER I WAS
INVARIABLY OBLIGED TO PART WITH
THE SUNDAY EVENING WAS SPENT IN REPEATING BY HEART THE CHURCH
CATECHISM AND THE FIFTH SIXTH AND SEVENTH CHAPTERS OF ST
MATTHEW AND
IN LISTENING TO A LONG SERMON READ BY MISS MILLER WHOSE IRREPRESSIBLE
YAWNS ATTESTED HER WEARINESS
A FREQUENT INTERLUDE OF THESE PERFORMANCES
WAS THE ENACTMENT OF THE PART OF EUTYCHUS BY SOME HALF DOZEN OF LITTLE
GIRLS WHO OVERPOWERED WITH SLEEP WOULD FALL DOWN IF NOT OUT OF THE
THIRD LOFT YET OFF THE FOURTH FORM AND BE TAKEN UP HALF DEAD
THE
REMEDY WAS TO THRUST THEM FORWARD INTO THE CENTRE OF THE SCHOOLROOM AND
OBLIGE THEM TO STAND THERE TILL THE SERMON WAS FINISHED
SOMETIMES THEIR
FEET FAILED THEM AND THEY SANK TOGETHER IN A HEAP THEY WERE THEN
PROPPED UP WITH THE MONITORS' HIGH STOOLS
I HAVE NOT YET ALLUDED TO THE VISITS OF MR
BROCKLEHURST AND INDEED THAT
GENTLEMAN WAS FROM HOME DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE FIRST MONTH AFTER
MY ARRIVAL PERHAPS PROLONGING HIS STAY WITH HIS FRIEND THE ARCHDEACON
HIS ABSENCE WAS A RELIEF TO ME
I NEED NOT SAY THAT I HAD MY OWN REASONS
FOR DREADING HIS COMING BUT COME HE DID AT LAST
ONE AFTERNOON I HAD THEN BEEN THREE WEEKS AT LOWOOD AS I WAS SITTING
WITH A SLATE IN MY HAND PUZZLING OVER A SUM IN LONG DIVISION MY EYES
RAISED IN ABSTRACTION TO THE WINDOW CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FIGURE JUST
PASSING I RECOGNISED ALMOST INSTINCTIVELY THAT GAUNT OUTLINE AND WHEN
TWO MINUTES AFTER ALL THE SCHOOL TEACHERS INCLUDED ROSE EN MASSE IT
WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO LOOK UP IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHOSE ENTRANCE
THEY THUS GREETED
A LONG STRIDE MEASURED THE SCHOOLROOM AND PRESENTLY
BESIDE MISS TEMPLE WHO HERSELF HAD RISEN STOOD THE SAME BLACK COLUMN
WHICH HAD FROWNED ON ME SO OMINOUSLY FROM THE HEARTHRUG OF GATESHEAD
I
NOW GLANCED SIDEWAYS AT THIS PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE
YES I WAS RIGHT IT
WAS MR
BROCKLEHURST BUTTONED UP IN A SURTOUT AND LOOKING LONGER
NARROWER AND MORE RIGID THAN EVER
I HAD MY OWN REASONS FOR BEING DISMAYED AT THIS APPARITION TOO WELL I
REMEMBERED THE PERFIDIOUS HINTS GIVEN BY MRS
REED ABOUT MY DISPOSITION
C THE PROMISE PLEDGED BY MR
BROCKLEHURST TO APPRISE MISS TEMPLE AND
THE TEACHERS OF MY VICIOUS NATURE
ALL ALONG I HAD BEEN DREADING THE
FULFILMENT OF THIS PROMISE I HAD BEEN LOOKING OUT DAILY FOR THE COMING
MAN WHOSE INFORMATION RESPECTING MY PAST LIFE AND CONVERSATION WAS TO
BRAND ME AS A BAD CHILD FOR EVER NOW THERE HE WAS
HE STOOD AT MISS TEMPLE'S SIDE HE WAS SPEAKING LOW IN HER EAR I DID NOT
DOUBT HE WAS MAKING DISCLOSURES OF MY VILLAINY AND I WATCHED HER EYE
WITH PAINFUL ANXIETY EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO SEE ITS DARK ORB TURN ON
ME A GLANCE OF REPUGNANCE AND CONTEMPT
I LISTENED TOO AND AS I
HAPPENED TO BE SEATED QUITE AT THE TOP OF THE ROOM I CAUGHT MOST OF WHAT
HE SAID ITS IMPORT RELIEVED ME FROM IMMEDIATE APPREHENSION
I SUPPOSE MISS TEMPLE THE THREAD I BOUGHT AT LOWTON WILL DO IT STRUCK
ME THAT IT WOULD BE JUST OF THE QUALITY FOR THE CALICO CHEMISES AND I
SORTED THE NEEDLES TO MATCH
YOU MAY TELL MISS SMITH THAT I FORGOT TO
MAKE A MEMORANDUM OF THE DARNING NEEDLES BUT SHE SHALL HAVE SOME PAPERS
SENT IN NEXT WEEK AND SHE IS NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT TO GIVE OUT MORE THAN
ONE AT A TIME TO EACH PUPIL IF THEY HAVE MORE THEY ARE APT TO BE
CARELESS AND LOSE THEM
AND O MA'AM I WISH THE WOOLLEN STOCKINGS WERE
BETTER LOOKED TO WHEN I WAS HERE LAST I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN GARDEN
AND EXAMINED THE CLOTHES DRYING ON THE LINE THERE WAS A QUANTITY OF
BLACK HOSE IN A VERY BAD STATE OF REPAIR FROM THE SIZE OF THE HOLES IN
THEM I WAS SURE THEY HAD NOT BEEN WELL MENDED FROM TIME TO TIME
HE PAUSED
YOUR DIRECTIONS SHALL BE ATTENDED TO SIR SAID MISS TEMPLE
AND MA'AM HE CONTINUED THE LAUNDRESS TELLS ME SOME OF THE GIRLS
HAVE TWO CLEAN TUCKERS IN THE WEEK IT IS TOO MUCH THE RULES LIMIT THEM
TO ONE
I THINK I CAN EXPLAIN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE SIR
AGNES AND CATHERINE
JOHNSTONE WERE INVITED TO TAKE TEA WITH SOME FRIENDS AT LOWTON LAST
THURSDAY AND I GAVE THEM LEAVE TO PUT ON CLEAN TUCKERS FOR THE
OCCASION
MR
BROCKLEHURST NODDED
WELL FOR ONCE IT MAY PASS BUT PLEASE NOT TO LET THE CIRCUMSTANCE OCCUR
TOO OFTEN
AND THERE IS ANOTHER THING WHICH SURPRISED ME I FIND IN
SETTLING ACCOUNTS WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER THAT A LUNCH CONSISTING OF BREAD
AND CHEESE HAS TWICE BEEN SERVED OUT TO THE GIRLS DURING THE PAST
FORTNIGHT
HOW IS THIS I LOOKED OVER THE REGULATIONS AND I FIND NO
SUCH MEAL AS LUNCH MENTIONED
WHO INTRODUCED THIS INNOVATION AND BY
WHAT AUTHORITY
I MUST BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCE SIR REPLIED MISS TEMPLE
THE BREAKFAST WAS SO ILL PREPARED THAT THE PUPILS COULD NOT POSSIBLY EAT
IT AND I DARED NOT ALLOW THEM TO REMAIN FASTING TILL DINNER TIME
MADAM ALLOW ME AN INSTANT
YOU ARE AWARE THAT MY PLAN IN BRINGING UP
THESE GIRLS IS NOT TO ACCUSTOM THEM TO HABITS OF LUXURY AND INDULGENCE
BUT TO RENDER THEM HARDY PATIENT SELF DENYING
SHOULD ANY LITTLE
ACCIDENTAL DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE APPETITE OCCUR SUCH AS THE SPOILING OF
A MEAL THE UNDER OR THE OVER DRESSING OF A DISH THE INCIDENT OUGHT NOT
TO BE NEUTRALISED BY REPLACING WITH SOMETHING MORE DELICATE THE COMFORT
LOST THUS PAMPERING THE BODY AND OBVIATING THE AIM OF THIS INSTITUTION
IT OUGHT TO BE IMPROVED TO THE SPIRITUAL EDIFICATION OF THE PUPILS BY
ENCOURAGING THEM TO EVINCE FORTITUDE UNDER TEMPORARY PRIVATION
A BRIEF
ADDRESS ON THOSE OCCASIONS WOULD NOT BE MISTIMED WHEREIN A JUDICIOUS
INSTRUCTOR WOULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF REFERRING TO THE SUFFERINGS OF
THE PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANS TO THE TORMENTS OF MARTYRS TO THE EXHORTATIONS
OF OUR BLESSED LORD HIMSELF CALLING UPON HIS DISCIPLES TO TAKE UP THEIR
CROSS AND FOLLOW HIM TO HIS WARNINGS THAT MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD
ALONE BUT BY EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDETH OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD TO HIS
DIVINE CONSOLATIONS IF YE SUFFER HUNGER OR THIRST FOR MY SAKE HAPPY
ARE YE OH MADAM WHEN YOU PUT BREAD AND CHEESE INSTEAD OF BURNT
PORRIDGE INTO THESE CHILDREN'S MOUTHS YOU MAY INDEED FEED THEIR VILE
BODIES BUT YOU LITTLE THINK HOW YOU STARVE THEIR IMMORTAL SOULS
MR
BROCKLEHURST AGAIN PAUSED PERHAPS OVERCOME BY HIS FEELINGS
MISS
TEMPLE HAD LOOKED DOWN WHEN HE FIRST BEGAN TO SPEAK TO HER BUT SHE NOW
GAZED STRAIGHT BEFORE HER AND HER FACE NATURALLY PALE AS MARBLE
APPEARED TO BE ASSUMING ALSO THE COLDNESS AND FIXITY OF THAT MATERIAL
ESPECIALLY HER MOUTH CLOSED AS IF IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A SCULPTOR'S
CHISEL TO OPEN IT AND HER BROW SETTLED GRADUALLY INTO PETRIFIED
SEVERITY
MEANTIME MR
BROCKLEHURST STANDING ON THE HEARTH WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND
HIS BACK MAJESTICALLY SURVEYED THE WHOLE SCHOOL
SUDDENLY HIS EYE GAVE
A BLINK AS IF IT HAD MET SOMETHING THAT EITHER DAZZLED OR SHOCKED ITS
PUPIL TURNING HE SAID IN MORE RAPID ACCENTS THAN HE HAD HITHERTO USED
MISS TEMPLE MISS TEMPLE WHAT WHAT IS THAT GIRL WITH CURLED HAIR
RED HAIR MA'AM CURLED CURLED ALL OVER AND EXTENDING HIS CANE HE
POINTED TO THE AWFUL OBJECT HIS HAND SHAKING AS HE DID SO
IT IS JULIA SEVERN REPLIED MISS TEMPLE VERY QUIETLY
JULIA SEVERN MA'AM AND WHY HAS SHE OR ANY OTHER CURLED HAIR WHY
IN DEFIANCE OF EVERY PRECEPT AND PRINCIPLE OF THIS HOUSE DOES SHE
CONFORM TO THE WORLD SO OPENLY HERE IN AN EVANGELICAL CHARITABLE
ESTABLISHMENT AS TO WEAR HER HAIR ONE MASS OF CURLS
JULIA'S HAIR CURLS NATURALLY RETURNED MISS TEMPLE STILL MORE QUIETLY
NATURALLY YES BUT WE ARE NOT TO CONFORM TO NATURE I WISH THESE GIRLS
TO BE THE CHILDREN OF GRACE AND WHY THAT ABUNDANCE I HAVE AGAIN AND
AGAIN INTIMATED THAT I DESIRE THE HAIR TO BE ARRANGED CLOSELY MODESTLY
PLAINLY
MISS TEMPLE THAT GIRL'S HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF ENTIRELY I WILL
SEND A BARBER TO MORROW AND I SEE OTHERS WHO HAVE FAR TOO MUCH OF THE
EXCRESCENCE THAT TALL GIRL TELL HER TO TURN ROUND
TELL ALL THE FIRST
FORM TO RISE UP AND DIRECT THEIR FACES TO THE WALL
MISS TEMPLE PASSED HER HANDKERCHIEF OVER HER LIPS AS IF TO SMOOTH AWAY
THE INVOLUNTARY SMILE THAT CURLED THEM SHE GAVE THE ORDER HOWEVER AND
WHEN THE FIRST CLASS COULD TAKE IN WHAT WAS REQUIRED OF THEM THEY
OBEYED
LEANING A LITTLE BACK ON MY BENCH I COULD SEE THE LOOKS AND
GRIMACES WITH WHICH THEY COMMENTED ON THIS MANOEUVRE IT WAS A PITY MR
BROCKLEHURST COULD NOT SEE THEM TOO HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE FELT THAT
WHATEVER HE MIGHT DO WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THE CUP AND PLATTER THE INSIDE
WAS FURTHER BEYOND HIS INTERFERENCE THAN HE IMAGINED
HE SCRUTINISED THE REVERSE OF THESE LIVING MEDALS SOME FIVE MINUTES THEN
PRONOUNCED SENTENCE
THESE WORDS FELL LIKE THE KNELL OF DOOM
ALL THOSE TOP KNOTS MUST BE CUT OFF
MISS TEMPLE SEEMED TO REMONSTRATE
MADAM HE PURSUED I HAVE A MASTER TO SERVE WHOSE KINGDOM IS NOT OF
THIS WORLD MY MISSION IS TO MORTIFY IN THESE GIRLS THE LUSTS OF THE
FLESH TO TEACH THEM TO CLOTHE THEMSELVES WITH SHAME FACEDNESS AND
SOBRIETY NOT WITH BRAIDED HAIR AND COSTLY APPAREL AND EACH OF THE YOUNG
PERSONS BEFORE US HAS A STRING OF HAIR TWISTED IN PLAITS WHICH VANITY
ITSELF MIGHT HAVE WOVEN THESE I REPEAT MUST BE CUT OFF THINK OF THE
TIME WASTED OF
MR
BROCKLEHURST WAS HERE INTERRUPTED THREE OTHER VISITORS LADIES NOW
ENTERED THE ROOM
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE COME A LITTLE SOONER TO HAVE HEARD
HIS LECTURE ON DRESS FOR THEY WERE SPLENDIDLY ATTIRED IN VELVET SILK
AND FURS
THE TWO YOUNGER OF THE TRIO FINE GIRLS OF SIXTEEN AND
SEVENTEEN HAD GREY BEAVER HATS THEN IN FASHION SHADED WITH OSTRICH
PLUMES AND FROM UNDER THE BRIM OF THIS GRACEFUL HEAD DRESS FELL A
PROFUSION OF LIGHT TRESSES ELABORATELY CURLED THE ELDER LADY WAS
ENVELOPED IN A COSTLY VELVET SHAWL TRIMMED WITH ERMINE AND SHE WORE A
FALSE FRONT OF FRENCH CURLS
THESE LADIES WERE DEFERENTIALLY RECEIVED BY MISS TEMPLE AS MRS
AND THE
MISSES BROCKLEHURST AND CONDUCTED TO SEATS OF HONOUR AT THE TOP OF THE
ROOM
IT SEEMS THEY HAD COME IN THE CARRIAGE WITH THEIR REVEREND
RELATIVE AND HAD BEEN CONDUCTING A RUMMAGING SCRUTINY OF THE ROOM
UPSTAIRS WHILE HE TRANSACTED BUSINESS WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER QUESTIONED
THE LAUNDRESS AND LECTURED THE SUPERINTENDENT
THEY NOW PROCEEDED TO
ADDRESS DIVERS REMARKS AND REPROOFS TO MISS SMITH WHO WAS CHARGED WITH
THE CARE OF THE LINEN AND THE INSPECTION OF THE DORMITORIES BUT I HAD NO
TIME TO LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID OTHER MATTERS CALLED OFF AND ENCHANTED
MY ATTENTION
HITHERTO WHILE GATHERING UP THE DISCOURSE OF MR
BROCKLEHURST AND MISS
TEMPLE I HAD NOT AT THE SAME TIME NEGLECTED PRECAUTIONS TO SECURE MY
PERSONAL SAFETY WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE EFFECTED IF I COULD ONLY ELUDE
OBSERVATION
TO THIS END I HAD SAT WELL BACK ON THE FORM AND WHILE
SEEMING TO BE BUSY WITH MY SUM HAD HELD MY SLATE IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO
CONCEAL MY FACE I MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED NOTICE HAD NOT MY TREACHEROUS
SLATE SOMEHOW HAPPENED TO SLIP FROM MY HAND AND FALLING WITH AN
OBTRUSIVE CRASH DIRECTLY DRAWN EVERY EYE UPON ME I KNEW IT WAS ALL OVER
NOW AND AS I STOOPED TO PICK UP THE TWO FRAGMENTS OF SLATE I RALLIED
MY FORCES FOR THE WORST
IT CAME
A CARELESS GIRL SAID MR
BROCKLEHURST AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT IS
THE NEW PUPIL I PERCEIVE AND BEFORE I COULD DRAW BREATH I MUST NOT
FORGET I HAVE A WORD TO SAY RESPECTING HER THEN ALOUD HOW LOUD IT
SEEMED TO ME LET THE CHILD WHO BROKE HER SLATE COME FORWARD
OF MY OWN ACCORD I COULD NOT HAVE STIRRED I WAS PARALYSED BUT THE TWO
GREAT GIRLS WHO SIT ON EACH SIDE OF ME SET ME ON MY LEGS AND PUSHED ME
TOWARDS THE DREAD JUDGE AND THEN MISS TEMPLE GENTLY ASSISTED ME TO HIS
VERY FEET AND I CAUGHT HER WHISPERED COUNSEL
DON'T BE AFRAID JANE I SAW IT WAS AN ACCIDENT YOU SHALL NOT BE
PUNISHED
THE KIND WHISPER WENT TO MY HEART LIKE A DAGGER
ANOTHER MINUTE AND SHE WILL DESPISE ME FOR A HYPOCRITE THOUGHT I AND
AN IMPULSE OF FURY AGAINST REED BROCKLEHURST AND CO
BOUNDED IN MY
PULSES AT THE CONVICTION
I WAS NO HELEN BURNS
FETCH THAT STOOL SAID MR
BROCKLEHURST POINTING TO A VERY HIGH ONE
FROM WHICH A MONITOR HAD JUST RISEN IT WAS BROUGHT
PLACE THE CHILD UPON IT
AND I WAS PLACED THERE BY WHOM I DON'T KNOW I WAS IN NO CONDITION TO
NOTE PARTICULARS I WAS ONLY AWARE THAT THEY HAD HOISTED ME UP TO THE
HEIGHT OF MR
BROCKLEHURST'S NOSE THAT HE WAS WITHIN A YARD OF ME AND
THAT A SPREAD OF SHOT ORANGE AND PURPLE SILK PELISSES AND A CLOUD OF
SILVERY PLUMAGE EXTENDED AND WAVED BELOW ME
MR
BROCKLEHURST HEMMED
LADIES SAID HE TURNING TO HIS FAMILY MISS TEMPLE TEACHERS AND
CHILDREN YOU ALL SEE THIS GIRL
OF COURSE THEY DID FOR I FELT THEIR EYES DIRECTED LIKE BURNING GLASSES
AGAINST MY SCORCHED SKIN
YOU SEE SHE IS YET YOUNG YOU OBSERVE SHE POSSESSES THE ORDINARY FORM OF
CHILDHOOD GOD HAS GRACIOUSLY GIVEN HER THE SHAPE THAT HE HAS GIVEN TO
ALL OF US NO SIGNAL DEFORMITY POINTS HER OUT AS A MARKED CHARACTER
WHO
WOULD THINK THAT THE EVIL ONE HAD ALREADY FOUND A SERVANT AND AGENT IN
HER YET SUCH I GRIEVE TO SAY IS THE CASE
A PAUSE IN WHICH I BEGAN TO STEADY THE PALSY OF MY NERVES AND TO FEEL
THAT THE RUBICON WAS PASSED AND THAT THE TRIAL NO LONGER TO BE SHIRKED
MUST BE FIRMLY SUSTAINED
MY DEAR CHILDREN PURSUED THE BLACK MARBLE CLERGYMAN WITH PATHOS
THIS IS A SAD A MELANCHOLY OCCASION FOR IT BECOMES MY DUTY TO WARN
YOU THAT THIS GIRL WHO MIGHT BE ONE OF GOD'S OWN LAMBS IS A LITTLE
CASTAWAY NOT A MEMBER OF THE TRUE FLOCK BUT EVIDENTLY AN INTERLOPER AND
AN ALIEN
YOU MUST BE ON YOUR GUARD AGAINST HER YOU MUST SHUN HER
EXAMPLE IF NECESSARY AVOID HER COMPANY EXCLUDE HER FROM YOUR SPORTS
AND SHUT HER OUT FROM YOUR CONVERSE
TEACHERS YOU MUST WATCH HER KEEP
YOUR EYES ON HER MOVEMENTS WEIGH WELL HER WORDS SCRUTINISE HER ACTIONS
PUNISH HER BODY TO SAVE HER SOUL IF INDEED SUCH SALVATION BE POSSIBLE
FOR MY TONGUE FALTERS WHILE I TELL IT THIS GIRL THIS CHILD THE NATIVE
OF A CHRISTIAN LAND WORSE THAN MANY A LITTLE HEATHEN WHO SAYS ITS
PRAYERS TO BRAHMA AND KNEELS BEFORE JUGGERNAUT THIS GIRL IS A LIAR
NOW CAME A PAUSE OF TEN MINUTES DURING WHICH I BY THIS TIME IN PERFECT
POSSESSION OF MY WITS OBSERVED ALL THE FEMALE BROCKLEHURSTS PRODUCE
THEIR POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS AND APPLY THEM TO THEIR OPTICS WHILE THE
ELDERLY LADY SWAYED HERSELF TO AND FRO AND THE TWO YOUNGER ONES
WHISPERED HOW SHOCKING MR
BROCKLEHURST RESUMED
THIS I LEARNED FROM HER BENEFACTRESS FROM THE PIOUS AND CHARITABLE LADY
WHO ADOPTED HER IN HER ORPHAN STATE REARED HER AS HER OWN DAUGHTER AND
WHOSE KINDNESS WHOSE GENEROSITY THE UNHAPPY GIRL REPAID BY AN
INGRATITUDE SO BAD SO DREADFUL THAT AT LAST HER EXCELLENT PATRONESS WAS
OBLIGED TO SEPARATE HER FROM HER OWN YOUNG ONES FEARFUL LEST HER VICIOUS
EXAMPLE SHOULD CONTAMINATE THEIR PURITY SHE HAS SENT HER HERE TO BE
HEALED EVEN AS THE JEWS OF OLD SENT THEIR DISEASED TO THE TROUBLED POOL
OF BETHESDA AND TEACHERS SUPERINTENDENT I BEG OF YOU NOT TO ALLOW THE
WATERS TO STAGNATE ROUND HER
WITH THIS SUBLIME CONCLUSION MR
BROCKLEHURST ADJUSTED THE TOP BUTTON OF
HIS SURTOUT MUTTERED SOMETHING TO HIS FAMILY WHO ROSE BOWED TO MISS
TEMPLE AND THEN ALL THE GREAT PEOPLE SAILED IN STATE FROM THE ROOM
TURNING AT THE DOOR MY JUDGE SAID
LET HER STAND HALF AN HOUR LONGER ON THAT STOOL AND LET NO ONE SPEAK TO
HER DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY
THERE WAS I THEN MOUNTED ALOFT I WHO HAD SAID I COULD NOT BEAR THE
SHAME OF STANDING ON MY NATURAL FEET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WAS NOW
EXPOSED TO GENERAL VIEW ON A PEDESTAL OF INFAMY
WHAT MY SENSATIONS WERE
NO LANGUAGE CAN DESCRIBE BUT JUST AS THEY ALL ROSE STIFLING MY BREATH
AND CONSTRICTING MY THROAT A GIRL CAME UP AND PASSED ME IN PASSING SHE
LIFTED HER EYES
WHAT A STRANGE LIGHT INSPIRED THEM WHAT AN
EXTRAORDINARY SENSATION THAT RAY SENT THROUGH ME HOW THE NEW FEELING
BORE ME UP IT WAS AS IF A MARTYR A HERO HAD PASSED A SLAVE OR VICTIM
AND IMPARTED STRENGTH IN THE TRANSIT
I MASTERED THE RISING HYSTERIA
LIFTED UP MY HEAD AND TOOK A FIRM STAND ON THE STOOL
HELEN BURNS ASKED
SOME SLIGHT QUESTION ABOUT HER WORK OF MISS SMITH WAS CHIDDEN FOR THE
TRIVIALITY OF THE INQUIRY RETURNED TO HER PLACE AND SMILED AT ME AS SHE
AGAIN WENT BY
WHAT A SMILE I REMEMBER IT NOW AND I KNOW THAT IT WAS
THE EFFLUENCE OF FINE INTELLECT OF TRUE COURAGE IT LIT UP HER MARKED
LINEAMENTS HER THIN FACE HER SUNKEN GREY EYE LIKE A REFLECTION FROM
THE ASPECT OF AN ANGEL
YET AT THAT MOMENT HELEN BURNS WORE ON HER ARM
THE UNTIDY BADGE SCARCELY AN HOUR AGO I HAD HEARD HER CONDEMNED BY
MISS SCATCHERD TO A DINNER OF BREAD AND WATER ON THE MORROW BECAUSE SHE
HAD BLOTTED AN EXERCISE IN COPYING IT OUT
SUCH IS THE IMPERFECT NATURE
OF MAN SUCH SPOTS ARE THERE ON THE DISC OF THE CLEAREST PLANET AND EYES
LIKE MISS SCATCHERD'S CAN ONLY SEE THOSE MINUTE DEFECTS AND ARE BLIND TO
THE FULL BRIGHTNESS OF THE ORB
CHAPTER VIII
ERE THE HALF HOUR ENDED FIVE O'CLOCK STRUCK SCHOOL WAS DISMISSED AND
ALL WERE GONE INTO THE REFECTORY TO TEA
I NOW VENTURED TO DESCEND IT
WAS DEEP DUSK I RETIRED INTO A CORNER AND SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR
THE
SPELL BY WHICH I HAD BEEN SO FAR SUPPORTED BEGAN TO DISSOLVE REACTION
TOOK PLACE AND SOON SO OVERWHELMING WAS THE GRIEF THAT SEIZED ME I
SANK PROSTRATE WITH MY FACE TO THE GROUND
NOW I WEPT HELEN BURNS WAS
NOT HERE NOTHING SUSTAINED ME LEFT TO MYSELF I ABANDONED MYSELF AND MY
TEARS WATERED THE BOARDS
I HAD MEANT TO BE SO GOOD AND TO DO SO MUCH
AT LOWOOD TO MAKE SO MANY FRIENDS TO EARN RESPECT AND WIN AFFECTION
ALREADY I HAD MADE VISIBLE PROGRESS THAT VERY MORNING I HAD REACHED THE
HEAD OF MY CLASS MISS MILLER HAD PRAISED ME WARMLY MISS TEMPLE HAD
SMILED APPROBATION SHE HAD PROMISED TO TEACH ME DRAWING AND TO LET ME
LEARN FRENCH IF I CONTINUED TO MAKE SIMILAR IMPROVEMENT TWO MONTHS
LONGER AND THEN I WAS WELL RECEIVED BY MY FELLOW PUPILS TREATED AS AN
EQUAL BY THOSE OF MY OWN AGE AND NOT MOLESTED BY ANY NOW HERE I LAY
AGAIN CRUSHED AND TRODDEN ON AND COULD I EVER RISE MORE
NEVER I THOUGHT AND ARDENTLY I WISHED TO DIE
WHILE SOBBING OUT THIS
WISH IN BROKEN ACCENTS SOME ONE APPROACHED I STARTED UP AGAIN HELEN
BURNS WAS NEAR ME THE FADING FIRES JUST SHOWED HER COMING UP THE LONG
VACANT ROOM SHE BROUGHT MY COFFEE AND BREAD
COME EAT SOMETHING SHE SAID BUT I PUT BOTH AWAY FROM ME FEELING AS
IF A DROP OR A CRUMB WOULD HAVE CHOKED ME IN MY PRESENT CONDITION
HELEN
REGARDED ME PROBABLY WITH SURPRISE I COULD NOT NOW ABATE MY AGITATION
THOUGH I TRIED HARD I CONTINUED TO WEEP ALOUD
SHE SAT DOWN ON THE
GROUND NEAR ME EMBRACED HER KNEES WITH HER ARMS AND RESTED HER HEAD
UPON THEM IN THAT ATTITUDE SHE REMAINED SILENT AS AN INDIAN
I WAS THE
FIRST WHO SPOKE
HELEN WHY DO YOU STAY WITH A GIRL WHOM EVERYBODY BELIEVES TO BE A
LIAR
EVERYBODY JANE WHY THERE ARE ONLY EIGHTY PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEARD YOU
CALLED SO AND THE WORLD CONTAINS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
BUT WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH MILLIONS THE EIGHTY I KNOW DESPISE ME
JANE YOU ARE MISTAKEN PROBABLY NOT ONE IN THE SCHOOL EITHER DESPISES
OR DISLIKES YOU MANY I AM SURE PITY YOU MUCH
HOW CAN THEY PITY ME AFTER WHAT MR
BROCKLEHURST HAS SAID
MR
BROCKLEHURST IS NOT A GOD NOR IS HE EVEN A GREAT AND ADMIRED MAN
HE IS LITTLE LIKED HERE HE NEVER TOOK STEPS TO MAKE HIMSELF LIKED
HAD
HE TREATED YOU AS AN ESPECIAL FAVOURITE YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND ENEMIES
DECLARED OR COVERT ALL AROUND YOU AS IT IS THE GREATER NUMBER WOULD
OFFER YOU SYMPATHY IF THEY DARED
TEACHERS AND PUPILS MAY LOOK COLDLY ON
YOU FOR A DAY OR TWO BUT FRIENDLY FEELINGS ARE CONCEALED IN THEIR
HEARTS AND IF YOU PERSEVERE IN DOING WELL THESE FEELINGS WILL ERE LONG
APPEAR SO MUCH THE MORE EVIDENTLY FOR THEIR TEMPORARY SUPPRESSION
BESIDES JANE SHE PAUSED
WELL HELEN SAID I PUTTING MY HAND INTO HERS SHE CHAFED MY FINGERS
GENTLY TO WARM THEM AND WENT ON
IF ALL THE WORLD HATED YOU AND BELIEVED YOU WICKED WHILE YOUR OWN
CONSCIENCE APPROVED YOU AND ABSOLVED YOU FROM GUILT YOU WOULD NOT BE
WITHOUT FRIENDS
NO I KNOW I SHOULD THINK WELL OF MYSELF BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH IF
OTHERS DON'T LOVE ME I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN LIVE I CANNOT BEAR TO BE
SOLITARY AND HATED HELEN
LOOK HERE TO GAIN SOME REAL AFFECTION FROM
YOU OR MISS TEMPLE OR ANY OTHER WHOM I TRULY LOVE I WOULD WILLINGLY
SUBMIT TO HAVE THE BONE OF MY ARM BROKEN OR TO LET A BULL TOSS ME OR TO
STAND BEHIND A KICKING HORSE AND LET IT DASH ITS HOOF AT MY CHEST
HUSH JANE YOU THINK TOO MUCH OF THE LOVE OF HUMAN BEINGS YOU ARE TOO
IMPULSIVE TOO VEHEMENT THE SOVEREIGN HAND THAT CREATED YOUR FRAME AND
PUT LIFE INTO IT HAS PROVIDED YOU WITH OTHER RESOURCES THAN YOUR FEEBLE
SELF OR THAN CREATURES FEEBLE AS YOU
BESIDES THIS EARTH AND BESIDES
THE RACE OF MEN THERE IS AN INVISIBLE WORLD AND A KINGDOM OF SPIRITS
THAT WORLD IS ROUND US FOR IT IS EVERYWHERE AND THOSE SPIRITS WATCH US
FOR THEY ARE COMMISSIONED TO GUARD US AND IF WE WERE DYING IN PAIN AND
SHAME IF SCORN SMOTE US ON ALL SIDES AND HATRED CRUSHED US ANGELS SEE
OUR TORTURES RECOGNISE OUR INNOCENCE IF INNOCENT WE BE AS I KNOW YOU
ARE OF THIS CHARGE WHICH MR
BROCKLEHURST HAS WEAKLY AND POMPOUSLY
REPEATED AT SECOND HAND FROM MRS
REED FOR I READ A SINCERE NATURE IN
YOUR ARDENT EYES AND ON YOUR CLEAR FRONT AND GOD WAITS ONLY THE
SEPARATION OF SPIRIT FROM FLESH TO CROWN US WITH A FULL REWARD
WHY
THEN SHOULD WE EVER SINK OVERWHELMED WITH DISTRESS WHEN LIFE IS SO SOON
OVER AND DEATH IS SO CERTAIN AN ENTRANCE TO HAPPINESS TO GLORY
I WAS SILENT HELEN HAD CALMED ME BUT IN THE TRANQUILLITY SHE IMPARTED
THERE WAS AN ALLOY OF INEXPRESSIBLE SADNESS
I FELT THE IMPRESSION OF
WOE AS SHE SPOKE BUT I COULD NOT TELL WHENCE IT CAME AND WHEN HAVING
DONE SPEAKING SHE BREATHED A LITTLE FAST AND COUGHED A SHORT COUGH I
MOMENTARILY FORGOT MY OWN SORROWS TO YIELD TO A VAGUE CONCERN FOR HER
RESTING MY HEAD ON HELEN'S SHOULDER I PUT MY ARMS ROUND HER WAIST SHE
DREW ME TO HER AND WE REPOSED IN SILENCE
WE HAD NOT SAT LONG THUS
WHEN ANOTHER PERSON CAME IN
SOME HEAVY CLOUDS SWEPT FROM THE SKY BY A
RISING WIND HAD LEFT THE MOON BARE AND HER LIGHT STREAMING IN THROUGH
A WINDOW NEAR SHONE FULL BOTH ON US AND ON THE APPROACHING FIGURE WHICH
WE AT ONCE RECOGNISED AS MISS TEMPLE
I CAME ON PURPOSE TO FIND YOU JANE EYRE SAID SHE I WANT YOU IN MY
ROOM AND AS HELEN BURNS IS WITH YOU SHE MAY COME TOO
WE WENT FOLLOWING THE SUPERINTENDENT'S GUIDANCE WE HAD TO THREAD SOME
INTRICATE PASSAGES AND MOUNT A STAIRCASE BEFORE WE REACHED HER
APARTMENT IT CONTAINED A GOOD FIRE AND LOOKED CHEERFUL
MISS TEMPLE
TOLD HELEN BURNS TO BE SEATED IN A LOW ARM CHAIR ON ONE SIDE OF THE
HEARTH AND HERSELF TAKING ANOTHER SHE CALLED ME TO HER SIDE
IS IT ALL OVER SHE ASKED LOOKING DOWN AT MY FACE
HAVE YOU CRIED
YOUR GRIEF AWAY
I AM AFRAID I NEVER SHALL DO THAT
WHY
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN WRONGLY ACCUSED AND YOU MA'AM AND EVERYBODY ELSE
WILL NOW THINK ME WICKED
WE SHALL THINK YOU WHAT YOU PROVE YOURSELF TO BE MY CHILD
CONTINUE TO
ACT AS A GOOD GIRL AND YOU WILL SATISFY US
SHALL I MISS TEMPLE
YOU WILL SAID SHE PASSING HER ARM ROUND ME
AND NOW TELL ME WHO IS
THE LADY WHOM MR
BROCKLEHURST CALLED YOUR BENEFACTRESS
MRS
REED MY UNCLE'S WIFE
MY UNCLE IS DEAD AND HE LEFT ME TO HER
CARE
DID SHE NOT THEN ADOPT YOU OF HER OWN ACCORD
NO MA'AM SHE WAS SORRY TO HAVE TO DO IT BUT MY UNCLE AS I HAVE OFTEN
HEARD THE SERVANTS SAY GOT HER TO PROMISE BEFORE HE DIED THAT SHE WOULD
ALWAYS KEEP ME
WELL NOW JANE YOU KNOW OR AT LEAST I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN A
CRIMINAL IS ACCUSED HE IS ALWAYS ALLOWED TO SPEAK IN HIS OWN DEFENCE
YOU HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH FALSEHOOD DEFEND YOURSELF TO ME AS WELL AS
YOU CAN
SAY WHATEVER YOUR MEMORY SUGGESTS IS TRUE BUT ADD NOTHING AND
EXAGGERATE NOTHING
I RESOLVED IN THE DEPTH OF MY HEART THAT I WOULD BE MOST MODERATE MOST
CORRECT AND HAVING REFLECTED A FEW MINUTES IN ORDER TO ARRANGE
COHERENTLY WHAT I HAD TO SAY I TOLD HER ALL THE STORY OF MY SAD
CHILDHOOD
EXHAUSTED BY EMOTION MY LANGUAGE WAS MORE SUBDUED THAN IT
GENERALLY WAS WHEN IT DEVELOPED THAT SAD THEME AND MINDFUL OF HELEN'S
WARNINGS AGAINST THE INDULGENCE OF RESENTMENT I INFUSED INTO THE
NARRATIVE FAR LESS OF GALL AND WORMWOOD THAN ORDINARY
THUS RESTRAINED
AND SIMPLIFIED IT SOUNDED MORE CREDIBLE I FELT AS I WENT ON THAT MISS
TEMPLE FULLY BELIEVED ME
IN THE COURSE OF THE TALE I HAD MENTIONED MR
LLOYD AS HAVING COME TO SEE
ME AFTER THE FIT FOR I NEVER FORGOT THE TO ME FRIGHTFUL EPISODE OF THE
RED ROOM IN DETAILING WHICH MY EXCITEMENT WAS SURE IN SOME DEGREE TO
BREAK BOUNDS FOR NOTHING COULD SOFTEN IN MY RECOLLECTION THE SPASM OF
AGONY WHICH CLUTCHED MY HEART WHEN MRS
REED SPURNED MY WILD SUPPLICATION
FOR PARDON AND LOCKED ME A SECOND TIME IN THE DARK AND HAUNTED CHAMBER
I HAD FINISHED MISS TEMPLE REGARDED ME A FEW MINUTES IN SILENCE SHE
THEN SAID
I KNOW SOMETHING OF MR
LLOYD I SHALL WRITE TO HIM IF HIS REPLY AGREES
WITH YOUR STATEMENT YOU SHALL BE PUBLICLY CLEARED FROM EVERY IMPUTATION
TO ME JANE YOU ARE CLEAR NOW
SHE KISSED ME AND STILL KEEPING ME AT HER SIDE WHERE I WAS WELL
CONTENTED TO STAND FOR I DERIVED A CHILD'S PLEASURE FROM THE
CONTEMPLATION OF HER FACE HER DRESS HER ONE OR TWO ORNAMENTS HER WHITE
FOREHEAD HER CLUSTERED AND SHINING CURLS AND BEAMING DARK EYES SHE
PROCEEDED TO ADDRESS HELEN BURNS
HOW ARE YOU TO NIGHT HELEN HAVE YOU COUGHED MUCH TO DAY
NOT QUITE SO MUCH I THINK MA'AM
AND THE PAIN IN YOUR CHEST
IT IS A LITTLE BETTER
MISS TEMPLE GOT UP TOOK HER HAND AND EXAMINED HER PULSE THEN SHE
RETURNED TO HER OWN SEAT AS SHE RESUMED IT I HEARD HER SIGH LOW
SHE
WAS PENSIVE A FEW MINUTES THEN ROUSING HERSELF SHE SAID CHEERFULLY
BUT YOU TWO ARE MY VISITORS TO NIGHT I MUST TREAT YOU AS SUCH SHE
RANG HER BELL
BARBARA SHE SAID TO THE SERVANT WHO ANSWERED IT I HAVE NOT YET HAD
TEA BRING THE TRAY AND PLACE CUPS FOR THESE TWO YOUNG LADIES
AND A TRAY WAS SOON BROUGHT
HOW PRETTY TO MY EYES DID THE CHINA CUPS
AND BRIGHT TEAPOT LOOK PLACED ON THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE NEAR THE FIRE
HOW FRAGRANT WAS THE STEAM OF THE BEVERAGE AND THE SCENT OF THE TOAST
OF WHICH HOWEVER I TO MY DISMAY FOR I WAS BEGINNING TO BE HUNGRY
DISCERNED ONLY A VERY SMALL PORTION MISS TEMPLE DISCERNED IT TOO
BARBARA SAID SHE CAN YOU NOT BRING A LITTLE MORE BREAD AND BUTTER
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THREE
BARBARA WENT OUT SHE RETURNED SOON
MADAM MRS
HARDEN SAYS SHE HAS SENT UP THE USUAL QUANTITY
MRS
HARDEN BE IT OBSERVED WAS THE HOUSEKEEPER A WOMAN AFTER MR
BROCKLEHURST'S OWN HEART MADE UP OF EQUAL PARTS OF WHALEBONE AND IRON
OH VERY WELL RETURNED MISS TEMPLE WE MUST MAKE IT DO BARBARA I
SUPPOSE AND AS THE GIRL WITHDREW SHE ADDED SMILING FORTUNATELY I
HAVE IT IN MY POWER TO SUPPLY DEFICIENCIES FOR THIS ONCE
HAVING INVITED HELEN AND ME TO APPROACH THE TABLE AND PLACED BEFORE EACH
OF US A CUP OF TEA WITH ONE DELICIOUS BUT THIN MORSEL OF TOAST SHE GOT
UP UNLOCKED A DRAWER AND TAKING FROM IT A PARCEL WRAPPED IN PAPER
DISCLOSED PRESENTLY TO OUR EYES A GOOD SIZED SEED CAKE
I MEANT TO GIVE EACH OF YOU SOME OF THIS TO TAKE WITH YOU SAID SHE
BUT AS THERE IS SO LITTLE TOAST YOU MUST HAVE IT NOW AND SHE
PROCEEDED TO CUT SLICES WITH A GENEROUS HAND
WE FEASTED THAT EVENING AS ON NECTAR AND AMBROSIA AND NOT THE LEAST
DELIGHT OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS THE SMILE OF GRATIFICATION WITH WHICH
OUR HOSTESS REGARDED US AS WE SATISFIED OUR FAMISHED APPETITES ON THE
DELICATE FARE SHE LIBERALLY SUPPLIED
TEA OVER AND THE TRAY REMOVED SHE AGAIN SUMMONED US TO THE FIRE WE SAT
ONE ON EACH SIDE OF HER AND NOW A CONVERSATION FOLLOWED BETWEEN HER AND
HELEN WHICH IT WAS INDEED A PRIVILEGE TO BE ADMITTED TO HEAR
MISS TEMPLE HAD ALWAYS SOMETHING OF SERENITY IN HER AIR OF STATE IN HER
MIEN OF REFINED PROPRIETY IN HER LANGUAGE WHICH PRECLUDED DEVIATION
INTO THE ARDENT THE EXCITED THE EAGER SOMETHING WHICH CHASTENED THE
PLEASURE OF THOSE WHO LOOKED ON HER AND LISTENED TO HER BY A CONTROLLING
SENSE OF AWE AND SUCH WAS MY FEELING NOW BUT AS TO HELEN BURNS I WAS
STRUCK WITH WONDER
THE REFRESHING MEAL THE BRILLIANT FIRE THE PRESENCE AND KINDNESS OF HER
BELOVED INSTRUCTRESS OR PERHAPS MORE THAN ALL THESE SOMETHING IN HER
OWN UNIQUE MIND HAD ROUSED HER POWERS WITHIN HER
THEY WOKE THEY
KINDLED FIRST THEY GLOWED IN THE BRIGHT TINT OF HER CHEEK WHICH TILL
THIS HOUR I HAD NEVER SEEN BUT PALE AND BLOODLESS THEN THEY SHONE IN THE
LIQUID LUSTRE OF HER EYES WHICH HAD SUDDENLY ACQUIRED A BEAUTY MORE
SINGULAR THAN THAT OF MISS TEMPLE'S A BEAUTY NEITHER OF FINE COLOUR NOR
LONG EYELASH NOR PENCILLED BROW BUT OF MEANING OF MOVEMENT OF
RADIANCE
THEN HER SOUL SAT ON HER LIPS AND LANGUAGE FLOWED FROM WHAT
SOURCE I CANNOT TELL
HAS A GIRL OF FOURTEEN A HEART LARGE ENOUGH
VIGOROUS ENOUGH TO HOLD THE SWELLING SPRING OF PURE FULL FERVID
ELOQUENCE SUCH WAS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF HELEN'S DISCOURSE ON THAT TO
ME MEMORABLE EVENING HER SPIRIT SEEMED HASTENING TO LIVE WITHIN A VERY
BRIEF SPAN AS MUCH AS MANY LIVE DURING A PROTRACTED EXISTENCE
THEY CONVERSED OF THINGS I HAD NEVER HEARD OF OF NATIONS AND TIMES PAST
OF COUNTRIES FAR AWAY OF SECRETS OF NATURE DISCOVERED OR GUESSED AT
THEY SPOKE OF BOOKS HOW MANY THEY HAD READ WHAT STORES OF KNOWLEDGE
THEY POSSESSED THEN THEY SEEMED SO FAMILIAR WITH FRENCH NAMES AND
FRENCH AUTHORS BUT MY AMAZEMENT REACHED ITS CLIMAX WHEN MISS TEMPLE
ASKED HELEN IF SHE SOMETIMES SNATCHED A MOMENT TO RECALL THE LATIN HER
FATHER HAD TAUGHT HER AND TAKING A BOOK FROM A SHELF BADE HER READ AND
CONSTRUE A PAGE OF VIRGIL AND HELEN OBEYED MY ORGAN OF VENERATION
EXPANDING AT EVERY SOUNDING LINE
SHE HAD SCARCELY FINISHED ERE THE BELL
ANNOUNCED BEDTIME NO DELAY COULD BE ADMITTED MISS TEMPLE EMBRACED US
BOTH SAYING AS SHE DREW US TO HER HEART
GOD BLESS YOU MY CHILDREN
HELEN SHE HELD A LITTLE LONGER THAN ME SHE LET HER GO MORE RELUCTANTLY
IT WAS HELEN HER EYE FOLLOWED TO THE DOOR IT WAS FOR HER SHE A SECOND
TIME BREATHED A SAD SIGH FOR HER SHE WIPED A TEAR FROM HER CHEEK
ON REACHING THE BEDROOM WE HEARD THE VOICE OF MISS SCATCHERD SHE WAS
EXAMINING DRAWERS SHE HAD JUST PULLED OUT HELEN BURNS'S AND WHEN WE
ENTERED HELEN WAS GREETED WITH A SHARP REPRIMAND AND TOLD THAT TO MORROW
SHE SHOULD HAVE HALF A DOZEN OF UNTIDILY FOLDED ARTICLES PINNED TO HER
SHOULDER
MY THINGS WERE INDEED IN SHAMEFUL DISORDER MURMURED HELEN TO ME IN A
LOW VOICE I INTENDED TO HAVE ARRANGED THEM BUT I FORGOT
NEXT MORNING MISS SCATCHERD WROTE IN CONSPICUOUS CHARACTERS ON A PIECE
OF PASTEBOARD THE WORD SLATTERN AND BOUND IT LIKE A PHYLACTERY ROUND
HELEN'S LARGE MILD INTELLIGENT AND BENIGN LOOKING FOREHEAD
SHE WORE
IT TILL EVENING PATIENT UNRESENTFUL REGARDING IT AS A DESERVED
PUNISHMENT
THE MOMENT MISS SCATCHERD WITHDREW AFTER AFTERNOON SCHOOL I
RAN TO HELEN TORE IT OFF AND THRUST IT INTO THE FIRE THE FURY OF WHICH
SHE WAS INCAPABLE HAD BEEN BURNING IN MY SOUL ALL DAY AND TEARS HOT AND
LARGE HAD CONTINUALLY BEEN SCALDING MY CHEEK FOR THE SPECTACLE OF HER
SAD RESIGNATION GAVE ME AN INTOLERABLE PAIN AT THE HEART
ABOUT A WEEK SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE INCIDENTS ABOVE NARRATED MISS TEMPLE
WHO HAD WRITTEN TO MR
LLOYD RECEIVED HIS ANSWER IT APPEARED THAT WHAT
HE SAID WENT TO CORROBORATE MY ACCOUNT
MISS TEMPLE HAVING ASSEMBLED
THE WHOLE SCHOOL ANNOUNCED THAT INQUIRY HAD BEEN MADE INTO THE CHARGES
ALLEGED AGAINST JANE EYRE AND THAT SHE WAS MOST HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO
PRONOUNCE HER COMPLETELY CLEARED FROM EVERY IMPUTATION
THE TEACHERS
THEN SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AND KISSED ME AND A MURMUR OF PLEASURE RAN
THROUGH THE RANKS OF MY COMPANIONS
THUS RELIEVED OF A GRIEVOUS LOAD I FROM THAT HOUR SET TO WORK AFRESH
RESOLVED TO PIONEER MY WAY THROUGH EVERY DIFFICULTY I TOILED HARD AND
MY SUCCESS WAS PROPORTIONATE TO MY EFFORTS MY MEMORY NOT NATURALLY
TENACIOUS IMPROVED WITH PRACTICE EXERCISE SHARPENED MY WITS IN A FEW
WEEKS I WAS PROMOTED TO A HIGHER CLASS IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS I WAS
ALLOWED TO COMMENCE FRENCH AND DRAWING
I LEARNED THE FIRST TWO TENSES
OF THE VERB ETRE AND SKETCHED MY FIRST COTTAGE WHOSE WALLS BY THE
BYE OUTRIVALLED IN SLOPE THOSE OF THE LEANING TOWER OF PISA ON THE
SAME DAY
THAT NIGHT ON GOING TO BED I FORGOT TO PREPARE IN
IMAGINATION THE BARMECIDE SUPPER OF HOT ROAST POTATOES OR WHITE BREAD
AND NEW MILK WITH WHICH I WAS WONT TO AMUSE MY INWARD CRAVINGS I
FEASTED INSTEAD ON THE SPECTACLE OF IDEAL DRAWINGS WHICH I SAW IN THE
DARK ALL THE WORK OF MY OWN HANDS FREELY PENCILLED HOUSES AND TREES
PICTURESQUE ROCKS AND RUINS CUYP LIKE GROUPS OF CATTLE SWEET PAINTINGS
OF BUTTERFLIES HOVERING OVER UNBLOWN ROSES OF BIRDS PICKING AT RIPE
CHERRIES OF WREN'S NESTS ENCLOSING PEARL LIKE EGGS WREATHED ABOUT WITH
YOUNG IVY SPRAYS
I EXAMINED TOO IN THOUGHT THE POSSIBILITY OF MY
EVER BEING ABLE TO TRANSLATE CURRENTLY A CERTAIN LITTLE FRENCH STORY
WHICH MADAME PIERROT HAD THAT DAY SHOWN ME NOR WAS THAT PROBLEM SOLVED
TO MY SATISFACTION ERE I FELL SWEETLY ASLEEP
WELL HAS SOLOMON SAID BETTER IS A DINNER OF HERBS WHERE LOVE IS THAN A
STALLED OX AND HATRED THEREWITH
I WOULD NOT NOW HAVE EXCHANGED LOWOOD WITH ALL ITS PRIVATIONS FOR
GATESHEAD AND ITS DAILY LUXURIES
CHAPTER IX
BUT THE PRIVATIONS OR RATHER THE HARDSHIPS OF LOWOOD LESSENED
SPRING
DREW ON SHE WAS INDEED ALREADY COME THE FROSTS OF WINTER HAD CEASED
ITS SNOWS WERE MELTED ITS CUTTING WINDS AMELIORATED
MY WRETCHED FEET
FLAYED AND SWOLLEN TO LAMENESS BY THE SHARP AIR OF JANUARY BEGAN TO HEAL
AND SUBSIDE UNDER THE GENTLER BREATHINGS OF APRIL THE NIGHTS AND
MORNINGS NO LONGER BY THEIR CANADIAN TEMPERATURE FROZE THE VERY BLOOD IN
OUR VEINS WE COULD NOW ENDURE THE PLAY HOUR PASSED IN THE GARDEN
SOMETIMES ON A SUNNY DAY IT BEGAN EVEN TO BE PLEASANT AND GENIAL AND A
GREENNESS GREW OVER THOSE BROWN BEDS WHICH FRESHENING DAILY SUGGESTED
THE THOUGHT THAT HOPE TRAVERSED THEM AT NIGHT AND LEFT EACH MORNING
BRIGHTER TRACES OF HER STEPS
FLOWERS PEEPED OUT AMONGST THE LEAVES
SNOW DROPS CROCUSES PURPLE AURICULAS AND GOLDEN EYED PANSIES
ON
THURSDAY AFTERNOONS HALF HOLIDAYS WE NOW TOOK WALKS AND FOUND STILL
SWEETER FLOWERS OPENING BY THE WAYSIDE UNDER THE HEDGES
I DISCOVERED TOO THAT A GREAT PLEASURE AN ENJOYMENT WHICH THE HORIZON
ONLY BOUNDED LAY ALL OUTSIDE THE HIGH AND SPIKE GUARDED WALLS OF OUR
GARDEN THIS PLEASURE CONSISTED IN PROSPECT OF NOBLE SUMMITS GIRDLING A
GREAT HILL HOLLOW RICH IN VERDURE AND SHADOW IN A BRIGHT BECK FULL OF
DARK STONES AND SPARKLING EDDIES
HOW DIFFERENT HAD THIS SCENE LOOKED
WHEN I VIEWED IT LAID OUT BENEATH THE IRON SKY OF WINTER STIFFENED IN
FROST SHROUDED WITH SNOW WHEN MISTS AS CHILL AS DEATH WANDERED TO THE
IMPULSE OF EAST WINDS ALONG THOSE PURPLE PEAKS AND ROLLED DOWN ING AND
HOLM TILL THEY BLENDED WITH THE FROZEN FOG OF THE BECK THAT BECK ITSELF
WAS THEN A TORRENT TURBID AND CURBLESS IT TORE ASUNDER THE WOOD AND
SENT A RAVING SOUND THROUGH THE AIR OFTEN THICKENED WITH WILD RAIN OR
WHIRLING SLEET AND FOR THE FOREST ON ITS BANKS THAT SHOWED ONLY RANKS
OF SKELETONS
APRIL ADVANCED TO MAY A BRIGHT SERENE MAY IT WAS DAYS OF BLUE SKY
PLACID SUNSHINE AND SOFT WESTERN OR SOUTHERN GALES FILLED UP ITS
DURATION
AND NOW VEGETATION MATURED WITH VIGOUR LOWOOD SHOOK LOOSE ITS
TRESSES IT BECAME ALL GREEN ALL FLOWERY ITS GREAT ELM ASH AND OAK
SKELETONS WERE RESTORED TO MAJESTIC LIFE WOODLAND PLANTS SPRANG UP
PROFUSELY IN ITS RECESSES UNNUMBERED VARIETIES OF MOSS FILLED ITS
HOLLOWS AND IT MADE A STRANGE GROUND SUNSHINE OUT OF THE WEALTH OF ITS
WILD PRIMROSE PLANTS I HAVE SEEN THEIR PALE GOLD GLEAM IN OVERSHADOWED
SPOTS LIKE SCATTERINGS OF THE SWEETEST LUSTRE
ALL THIS I ENJOYED OFTEN
AND FULLY FREE UNWATCHED AND ALMOST ALONE FOR THIS UNWONTED LIBERTY
AND PLEASURE THERE WAS A CAUSE TO WHICH IT NOW BECOMES MY TASK TO
ADVERT
HAVE I NOT DESCRIBED A PLEASANT SITE FOR A DWELLING WHEN I SPEAK OF IT
AS BOSOMED IN HILL AND WOOD AND RISING FROM THE VERGE OF A STREAM
ASSUREDLY PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT WHETHER HEALTHY OR NOT IS ANOTHER
QUESTION
THAT FOREST DELL WHERE LOWOOD LAY WAS THE CRADLE OF FOG AND FOG BRED
PESTILENCE WHICH QUICKENING WITH THE QUICKENING SPRING CREPT INTO THE
ORPHAN ASYLUM BREATHED TYPHUS THROUGH ITS CROWDED SCHOOLROOM AND
DORMITORY AND ERE MAY ARRIVED TRANSFORMED THE SEMINARY INTO AN
HOSPITAL
SEMI STARVATION AND NEGLECTED COLDS HAD PREDISPOSED MOST OF THE PUPILS TO
RECEIVE INFECTION FORTY FIVE OUT OF THE EIGHTY GIRLS LAY ILL AT ONE
TIME
CLASSES WERE BROKEN UP RULES RELAXED
THE FEW WHO CONTINUED WELL
WERE ALLOWED ALMOST UNLIMITED LICENSE BECAUSE THE MEDICAL ATTENDANT
INSISTED ON THE NECESSITY OF FREQUENT EXERCISE TO KEEP THEM IN HEALTH
AND HAD IT BEEN OTHERWISE NO ONE HAD LEISURE TO WATCH OR RESTRAIN THEM
MISS TEMPLE'S WHOLE ATTENTION WAS ABSORBED BY THE PATIENTS SHE LIVED IN
THE SICK ROOM NEVER QUITTING IT EXCEPT TO SNATCH A FEW HOURS' REST AT
NIGHT
THE TEACHERS WERE FULLY OCCUPIED WITH PACKING UP AND MAKING OTHER
NECESSARY PREPARATIONS FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THOSE GIRLS WHO WERE
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE FRIENDS AND RELATIONS ABLE AND WILLING TO REMOVE
THEM FROM THE SEAT OF CONTAGION
MANY ALREADY SMITTEN WENT HOME ONLY
TO DIE SOME DIED AT THE SCHOOL AND WERE BURIED QUIETLY AND QUICKLY THE
NATURE OF THE MALADY FORBIDDING DELAY
WHILE DISEASE HAD THUS BECOME AN INHABITANT OF LOWOOD AND DEATH ITS
FREQUENT VISITOR WHILE THERE WAS GLOOM AND FEAR WITHIN ITS WALLS WHILE
ITS ROOMS AND PASSAGES STEAMED WITH HOSPITAL SMELLS THE DRUG AND THE
PASTILLE STRIVING VAINLY TO OVERCOME THE EFFLUVIA OF MORTALITY THAT
BRIGHT MAY SHONE UNCLOUDED OVER THE BOLD HILLS AND BEAUTIFUL WOODLAND OUT
OF DOORS
ITS GARDEN TOO GLOWED WITH FLOWERS HOLLYHOCKS HAD SPRUNG UP
TALL AS TREES LILIES HAD OPENED TULIPS AND ROSES WERE IN BLOOM THE
BORDERS OF THE LITTLE BEDS WERE GAY WITH PINK THRIFT AND CRIMSON DOUBLE
DAISIES THE SWEETBRIARS GAVE OUT MORNING AND EVENING THEIR SCENT OF
SPICE AND APPLES AND THESE FRAGRANT TREASURES WERE ALL USELESS FOR MOST
OF THE INMATES OF LOWOOD EXCEPT TO FURNISH NOW AND THEN A HANDFUL OF
HERBS AND BLOSSOMS TO PUT IN A COFFIN
BUT I AND THE REST WHO CONTINUED WELL ENJOYED FULLY THE BEAUTIES OF THE
SCENE AND SEASON THEY LET US RAMBLE IN THE WOOD LIKE GIPSIES FROM
MORNING TILL NIGHT WE DID WHAT WE LIKED WENT WHERE WE LIKED WE LIVED
BETTER TOO
MR
BROCKLEHURST AND HIS FAMILY NEVER CAME NEAR LOWOOD NOW
HOUSEHOLD MATTERS WERE NOT SCRUTINISED INTO THE CROSS HOUSEKEEPER WAS
GONE DRIVEN AWAY BY THE FEAR OF INFECTION HER SUCCESSOR WHO HAD BEEN
MATRON AT THE LOWTON DISPENSARY UNUSED TO THE WAYS OF HER NEW ABODE
PROVIDED WITH COMPARATIVE LIBERALITY
BESIDES THERE WERE FEWER TO FEED
THE SICK COULD EAT LITTLE OUR BREAKFAST BASINS WERE BETTER FILLED WHEN
THERE WAS NO TIME TO PREPARE A REGULAR DINNER WHICH OFTEN HAPPENED SHE
WOULD GIVE US A LARGE PIECE OF COLD PIE OR A THICK SLICE OF BREAD AND
CHEESE AND THIS WE CARRIED AWAY WITH US TO THE WOOD WHERE WE EACH CHOSE
THE SPOT WE LIKED BEST AND DINED SUMPTUOUSLY
MY FAVOURITE SEAT WAS A SMOOTH AND BROAD STONE RISING WHITE AND DRY FROM
THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE BECK AND ONLY TO BE GOT AT BY WADING THROUGH THE
WATER A FEAT I ACCOMPLISHED BAREFOOT
THE STONE WAS JUST BROAD ENOUGH
TO ACCOMMODATE COMFORTABLY ANOTHER GIRL AND ME AT THAT TIME MY CHOSEN
COMRADE ONE MARY ANN WILSON A SHREWD OBSERVANT PERSONAGE WHOSE
SOCIETY I TOOK PLEASURE IN PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS WITTY AND ORIGINAL
AND PARTLY BECAUSE SHE HAD A MANNER WHICH SET ME AT MY EASE
SOME YEARS
OLDER THAN I SHE KNEW MORE OF THE WORLD AND COULD TELL ME MANY THINGS I
LIKED TO HEAR WITH HER MY CURIOSITY FOUND GRATIFICATION TO MY FAULTS
ALSO SHE GAVE AMPLE INDULGENCE NEVER IMPOSING CURB OR REIN ON ANYTHING I
SAID
SHE HAD A TURN FOR NARRATIVE I FOR ANALYSIS SHE LIKED TO INFORM
I TO QUESTION SO WE GOT ON SWIMMINGLY TOGETHER DERIVING MUCH
ENTERTAINMENT IF NOT MUCH IMPROVEMENT FROM OUR MUTUAL INTERCOURSE
AND WHERE MEANTIME WAS HELEN BURNS WHY DID I NOT SPEND THESE SWEET
DAYS OF LIBERTY WITH HER HAD I FORGOTTEN HER OR WAS I SO WORTHLESS AS
TO HAVE GROWN TIRED OF HER PURE SOCIETY SURELY THE MARY ANN WILSON I
HAVE MENTIONED WAS INFERIOR TO MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE SHE COULD ONLY TELL
ME AMUSING STORIES AND RECIPROCATE ANY RACY AND PUNGENT GOSSIP I CHOSE
TO INDULGE IN WHILE IF I HAVE SPOKEN TRUTH OF HELEN SHE WAS QUALIFIED
TO GIVE THOSE WHO ENJOYED THE PRIVILEGE OF HER CONVERSE A TASTE OF FAR
HIGHER THINGS
TRUE READER AND I KNEW AND FELT THIS AND THOUGH I AM A DEFECTIVE
BEING WITH MANY FAULTS AND FEW REDEEMING POINTS YET I NEVER TIRED OF
HELEN BURNS NOR EVER CEASED TO CHERISH FOR HER A SENTIMENT OF
ATTACHMENT AS STRONG TENDER AND RESPECTFUL AS ANY THAT EVER ANIMATED
MY HEART
HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE WHEN HELEN AT ALL TIMES AND UNDER
ALL CIRCUMSTANCES EVINCED FOR ME A QUIET AND FAITHFUL FRIENDSHIP WHICH
ILL HUMOUR NEVER SOURED NOR IRRITATION NEVER TROUBLED BUT HELEN WAS
ILL AT PRESENT FOR SOME WEEKS SHE HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM MY SIGHT TO I
KNEW NOT WHAT ROOM UPSTAIRS
SHE WAS NOT I WAS TOLD IN THE HOSPITAL
PORTION OF THE HOUSE WITH THE FEVER PATIENTS FOR HER COMPLAINT WAS
CONSUMPTION NOT TYPHUS AND BY CONSUMPTION I IN MY IGNORANCE
UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING MILD WHICH TIME AND CARE WOULD BE SURE TO
ALLEVIATE
I WAS CONFIRMED IN THIS IDEA BY THE FACT OF HER ONCE OR TWICE COMING
DOWNSTAIRS ON VERY WARM SUNNY AFTERNOONS AND BEING TAKEN BY MISS TEMPLE
INTO THE GARDEN BUT ON THESE OCCASIONS I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO GO AND
SPEAK TO HER I ONLY SAW HER FROM THE SCHOOLROOM WINDOW AND THEN NOT
DISTINCTLY FOR SHE WAS MUCH WRAPPED UP AND SAT AT A DISTANCE UNDER THE
VERANDAH
ONE EVENING IN THE BEGINNING OF JUNE I HAD STAYED OUT VERY LATE WITH
MARY ANN IN THE WOOD WE HAD AS USUAL SEPARATED OURSELVES FROM THE
OTHERS AND HAD WANDERED FAR SO FAR THAT WE LOST OUR WAY AND HAD TO ASK
IT AT A LONELY COTTAGE WHERE A MAN AND WOMAN LIVED WHO LOOKED AFTER A
HERD OF HALF WILD SWINE THAT FED ON THE MAST IN THE WOOD
WHEN WE GOT
BACK IT WAS AFTER MOONRISE A PONY WHICH WE KNEW TO BE THE SURGEON'S
WAS STANDING AT THE GARDEN DOOR
MARY ANN REMARKED THAT SHE SUPPOSED
SOME ONE MUST BE VERY ILL AS MR
BATES HAD BEEN SENT FOR AT THAT TIME OF
THE EVENING
SHE WENT INTO THE HOUSE I STAYED BEHIND A FEW MINUTES TO
PLANT IN MY GARDEN A HANDFUL OF ROOTS I HAD DUG UP IN THE FOREST AND
WHICH I FEARED WOULD WITHER IF I LEFT THEM TILL THE MORNING
THIS DONE
I LINGERED YET A LITTLE LONGER THE FLOWERS SMELT SO SWEET AS THE DEW
FELL IT WAS SUCH A PLEASANT EVENING SO SERENE SO WARM THE STILL
GLOWING WEST PROMISED SO FAIRLY ANOTHER FINE DAY ON THE MORROW THE MOON
ROSE WITH SUCH MAJESTY IN THE GRAVE EAST
I WAS NOTING THESE THINGS AND
ENJOYING THEM AS A CHILD MIGHT WHEN IT ENTERED MY MIND AS IT HAD NEVER
DONE BEFORE
HOW SAD TO BE LYING NOW ON A SICK BED AND TO BE IN DANGER OF DYING
THIS WORLD IS PLEASANT IT WOULD BE DREARY TO BE CALLED FROM IT AND TO
HAVE TO GO WHO KNOWS WHERE
AND THEN MY MIND MADE ITS FIRST EARNEST EFFORT TO COMPREHEND WHAT HAD
BEEN INFUSED INTO IT CONCERNING HEAVEN AND HELL AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
IT RECOILED BAFFLED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME GLANCING BEHIND ON EACH
SIDE AND BEFORE IT IT SAW ALL ROUND AN UNFATHOMED GULF IT FELT THE ONE
POINT WHERE IT STOOD THE PRESENT ALL THE REST WAS FORMLESS CLOUD AND
VACANT DEPTH AND IT SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT OF TOTTERING AND PLUNGING
AMID THAT CHAOS
WHILE PONDERING THIS NEW IDEA I HEARD THE FRONT DOOR
OPEN MR
BATES CAME OUT AND WITH HIM WAS A NURSE
AFTER SHE HAD SEEN
HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND DEPART SHE WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE THE DOOR BUT I
RAN UP TO HER
HOW IS HELEN BURNS
VERY POORLY WAS THE ANSWER
IS IT HER MR
BATES HAS BEEN TO SEE
YES
AND WHAT DOES HE SAY ABOUT HER
HE SAYS SHE'LL NOT BE HERE LONG
THIS PHRASE UTTERED IN MY HEARING YESTERDAY WOULD HAVE ONLY CONVEYED
THE NOTION THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO BE REMOVED TO NORTHUMBERLAND TO HER OWN
HOME
I SHOULD NOT HAVE SUSPECTED THAT IT MEANT SHE WAS DYING BUT I
KNEW INSTANTLY NOW IT OPENED CLEAR ON MY COMPREHENSION THAT HELEN BURNS
WAS NUMBERING HER LAST DAYS IN THIS WORLD AND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE
TAKEN TO THE REGION OF SPIRITS IF SUCH REGION THERE WERE
I EXPERIENCED
A SHOCK OF HORROR THEN A STRONG THRILL OF GRIEF THEN A DESIRE A
NECESSITY TO SEE HER AND I ASKED IN WHAT ROOM SHE LAY
SHE IS IN MISS TEMPLE'S ROOM SAID THE NURSE
MAY I GO UP AND SPEAK TO HER
OH NO CHILD IT IS NOT LIKELY AND NOW IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO COME IN
YOU'LL CATCH THE FEVER IF YOU STOP OUT WHEN THE DEW IS FALLING
THE NURSE CLOSED THE FRONT DOOR I WENT IN BY THE SIDE ENTRANCE WHICH LED
TO THE SCHOOLROOM I WAS JUST IN TIME IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK AND MISS
MILLER WAS CALLING THE PUPILS TO GO TO BED
IT MIGHT BE TWO HOURS LATER PROBABLY NEAR ELEVEN WHEN I NOT HAVING
BEEN ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP AND DEEMING FROM THE PERFECT SILENCE OF THE
DORMITORY THAT MY COMPANIONS WERE ALL WRAPT IN PROFOUND REPOSE ROSE
SOFTLY PUT ON MY FROCK OVER MY NIGHT DRESS AND WITHOUT SHOES CREPT
FROM THE APARTMENT AND SET OFF IN QUEST OF MISS TEMPLE'S ROOM
IT WAS
QUITE AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE BUT I KNEW MY WAY AND THE LIGHT OF
THE UNCLOUDED SUMMER MOON ENTERING HERE AND THERE AT PASSAGE WINDOWS
ENABLED ME TO FIND IT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
AN ODOUR OF CAMPHOR AND BURNT
VINEGAR WARNED ME WHEN I CAME NEAR THE FEVER ROOM AND I PASSED ITS DOOR
QUICKLY FEARFUL LEST THE NURSE WHO SAT UP ALL NIGHT SHOULD HEAR ME
I
DREADED BEING DISCOVERED AND SENT BACK FOR I MUST SEE HELEN I MUST
EMBRACE HER BEFORE SHE DIED I MUST GIVE HER ONE LAST KISS EXCHANGE
WITH HER ONE LAST WORD
HAVING DESCENDED A STAIRCASE TRAVERSED A PORTION OF THE HOUSE BELOW AND
SUCCEEDED IN OPENING AND SHUTTING WITHOUT NOISE TWO DOORS I REACHED
ANOTHER FLIGHT OF STEPS THESE I MOUNTED AND THEN JUST OPPOSITE TO ME
WAS MISS TEMPLE'S ROOM
A LIGHT SHONE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND FROM UNDER
THE DOOR A PROFOUND STILLNESS PERVADED THE VICINITY
COMING NEAR I
FOUND THE DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR PROBABLY TO ADMIT SOME FRESH AIR INTO THE
CLOSE ABODE OF SICKNESS
INDISPOSED TO HESITATE AND FULL OF IMPATIENT
IMPULSES SOUL AND SENSES QUIVERING WITH KEEN THROES I PUT IT BACK AND
LOOKED IN
MY EYE SOUGHT HELEN AND FEARED TO FIND DEATH
CLOSE BY MISS TEMPLE'S BED AND HALF COVERED WITH ITS WHITE CURTAINS
THERE STOOD A LITTLE CRIB
I SAW THE OUTLINE OF A FORM UNDER THE
CLOTHES BUT THE FACE WAS HID BY THE HANGINGS THE NURSE I HAD SPOKEN TO
IN THE GARDEN SAT IN AN EASY CHAIR ASLEEP AN UNSNUFFED CANDLE BURNT
DIMLY ON THE TABLE
MISS TEMPLE WAS NOT TO BE SEEN I KNEW AFTERWARDS
THAT SHE HAD BEEN CALLED TO A DELIRIOUS PATIENT IN THE FEVER ROOM
I
ADVANCED THEN PAUSED BY THE CRIB SIDE MY HAND WAS ON THE CURTAIN BUT I
PREFERRED SPEAKING BEFORE I WITHDREW IT
I STILL RECOILED AT THE DREAD
OF SEEING A CORPSE
HELEN I WHISPERED SOFTLY ARE YOU AWAKE
SHE STIRRED HERSELF PUT BACK THE CURTAIN AND I SAW HER FACE PALE
WASTED BUT QUITE COMPOSED SHE LOOKED SO LITTLE CHANGED THAT MY FEAR WAS
INSTANTLY DISSIPATED
CAN IT BE YOU JANE SHE ASKED IN HER OWN GENTLE VOICE
OH I THOUGHT SHE IS NOT GOING TO DIE THEY ARE MISTAKEN SHE COULD
NOT SPEAK AND LOOK SO CALMLY IF SHE WERE
I GOT ON TO HER CRIB AND KISSED HER HER FOREHEAD WAS COLD AND HER CHEEK
BOTH COLD AND THIN AND SO WERE HER HAND AND WRIST BUT SHE SMILED AS OF
OLD
WHY ARE YOU COME HERE JANE IT IS PAST ELEVEN O'CLOCK I HEARD IT
STRIKE SOME MINUTES SINCE
I CAME TO SEE YOU HELEN I HEARD YOU WERE VERY ILL AND I COULD NOT
SLEEP TILL I HAD SPOKEN TO YOU
YOU CAME TO BID ME GOOD BYE THEN YOU ARE JUST IN TIME PROBABLY
ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE HELEN ARE YOU GOING HOME
YES TO MY LONG HOME MY LAST HOME
NO NO HELEN I STOPPED DISTRESSED
WHILE I TRIED TO DEVOUR MY
TEARS A FIT OF COUGHING SEIZED HELEN IT DID NOT HOWEVER WAKE THE
NURSE WHEN IT WAS OVER SHE LAY SOME MINUTES EXHAUSTED THEN SHE
WHISPERED
JANE YOUR LITTLE FEET ARE BARE LIE DOWN AND COVER YOURSELF WITH MY
QUILT
I DID SO SHE PUT HER ARM OVER ME AND I NESTLED CLOSE TO HER
AFTER A
LONG SILENCE SHE RESUMED STILL WHISPERING
I AM VERY HAPPY JANE AND WHEN YOU HEAR THAT I AM DEAD YOU MUST BE
SURE AND NOT GRIEVE THERE IS NOTHING TO GRIEVE ABOUT
WE ALL MUST DIE
ONE DAY AND THE ILLNESS WHICH IS REMOVING ME IS NOT PAINFUL IT IS
GENTLE AND GRADUAL MY MIND IS AT REST
I LEAVE NO ONE TO REGRET ME
MUCH I HAVE ONLY A FATHER AND HE IS LATELY MARRIED AND WILL NOT MISS
ME
BY DYING YOUNG I SHALL ESCAPE GREAT SUFFERINGS
I HAD NOT
QUALITIES OR TALENTS TO MAKE MY WAY VERY WELL IN THE WORLD I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN CONTINUALLY AT FAULT
BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO HELEN CAN YOU SEE DO YOU KNOW
I BELIEVE I HAVE FAITH I AM GOING TO GOD
WHERE IS GOD WHAT IS GOD
MY MAKER AND YOURS WHO WILL NEVER DESTROY WHAT HE CREATED
I RELY
IMPLICITLY ON HIS POWER AND CONFIDE WHOLLY IN HIS GOODNESS I COUNT THE
HOURS TILL THAT EVENTFUL ONE ARRIVES WHICH SHALL RESTORE ME TO HIM
REVEAL HIM TO ME
YOU ARE SURE THEN HELEN THAT THERE IS SUCH A PLACE AS HEAVEN AND
THAT OUR SOULS CAN GET TO IT WHEN WE DIE
I AM SURE THERE IS A FUTURE STATE I BELIEVE GOD IS GOOD I CAN RESIGN
MY IMMORTAL PART TO HIM WITHOUT ANY MISGIVING
GOD IS MY FATHER GOD IS
MY FRIEND I LOVE HIM I BELIEVE HE LOVES ME
AND SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN HELEN WHEN I DIE
YOU WILL COME TO THE SAME REGION OF HAPPINESS BE RECEIVED BY THE SAME
MIGHTY UNIVERSAL PARENT NO DOUBT DEAR JANE
AGAIN I QUESTIONED BUT THIS TIME ONLY IN THOUGHT
WHERE IS THAT
REGION DOES IT EXIST AND I CLASPED MY ARMS CLOSER ROUND HELEN SHE
SEEMED DEARER TO ME THAN EVER I FELT AS IF I COULD NOT LET HER GO I LAY
WITH MY FACE HIDDEN ON HER NECK
PRESENTLY SHE SAID IN THE SWEETEST
TONE
HOW COMFORTABLE I AM THAT LAST FIT OF COUGHING HAS TIRED ME A LITTLE
I FEEL AS IF I COULD SLEEP BUT DON'T LEAVE ME JANE I LIKE TO HAVE YOU
NEAR ME
I'LL STAY WITH YOU DEAR HELEN NO ONE SHALL TAKE ME AWAY
ARE YOU WARM DARLING
YES
GOOD NIGHT JANE
GOOD NIGHT HELEN
SHE KISSED ME AND I HER AND WE BOTH SOON SLUMBERED
WHEN I AWOKE IT WAS DAY AN UNUSUAL MOVEMENT ROUSED ME I LOOKED UP I
WAS IN SOMEBODY'S ARMS THE NURSE HELD ME SHE WAS CARRYING ME THROUGH
THE PASSAGE BACK TO THE DORMITORY
I WAS NOT REPRIMANDED FOR LEAVING MY
BED PEOPLE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT NO EXPLANATION WAS
AFFORDED THEN TO MY MANY QUESTIONS BUT A DAY OR TWO AFTERWARDS I LEARNED
THAT MISS TEMPLE ON RETURNING TO HER OWN ROOM AT DAWN HAD FOUND ME LAID
IN THE LITTLE CRIB MY FACE AGAINST HELEN BURNS'S SHOULDER MY ARMS ROUND
HER NECK
I WAS ASLEEP AND HELEN WAS DEAD
HER GRAVE IS IN BROCKLEBRIDGE CHURCHYARD FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER HER
DEATH IT WAS ONLY COVERED BY A GRASSY MOUND BUT NOW A GREY MARBLE TABLET
MARKS THE SPOT INSCRIBED WITH HER NAME AND THE WORD RESURGAM
CHAPTER X
HITHERTO I HAVE RECORDED IN DETAIL THE EVENTS OF MY INSIGNIFICANT
EXISTENCE TO THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE I HAVE GIVEN ALMOST AS MANY
CHAPTERS
BUT THIS IS NOT TO BE A REGULAR AUTOBIOGRAPHY
I AM ONLY
BOUND TO INVOKE MEMORY WHERE I KNOW HER RESPONSES WILL POSSESS SOME
DEGREE OF INTEREST THEREFORE I NOW PASS A SPACE OF EIGHT YEARS ALMOST IN
SILENCE A FEW LINES ONLY ARE NECESSARY TO KEEP UP THE LINKS OF
CONNECTION
WHEN THE TYPHUS FEVER HAD FULFILLED ITS MISSION OF DEVASTATION AT LOWOOD
IT GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED FROM THENCE BUT NOT TILL ITS VIRULENCE AND THE
NUMBER OF ITS VICTIMS HAD DRAWN PUBLIC ATTENTION ON THE SCHOOL
INQUIRY
WAS MADE INTO THE ORIGIN OF THE SCOURGE AND BY DEGREES VARIOUS FACTS
CAME OUT WHICH EXCITED PUBLIC INDIGNATION IN A HIGH DEGREE
THE
UNHEALTHY NATURE OF THE SITE THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE CHILDREN'S
FOOD THE BRACKISH FETID WATER USED IN ITS PREPARATION THE PUPILS'
WRETCHED CLOTHING AND ACCOMMODATIONS ALL THESE THINGS WERE DISCOVERED
AND THE DISCOVERY PRODUCED A RESULT MORTIFYING TO MR
BROCKLEHURST BUT
BENEFICIAL TO THE INSTITUTION
SEVERAL WEALTHY AND BENEVOLENT INDIVIDUALS IN THE COUNTY SUBSCRIBED
LARGELY FOR THE ERECTION OF A MORE CONVENIENT BUILDING IN A BETTER
SITUATION NEW REGULATIONS WERE MADE IMPROVEMENTS IN DIET AND CLOTHING
INTRODUCED THE FUNDS OF THE SCHOOL WERE INTRUSTED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF A
COMMITTEE
MR
BROCKLEHURST WHO FROM HIS WEALTH AND FAMILY
CONNECTIONS COULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED STILL RETAINED THE POST OF
TREASURER BUT HE WAS AIDED IN THE DISCHARGE OF HIS DUTIES BY GENTLEMEN
OF RATHER MORE ENLARGED AND SYMPATHISING MINDS HIS OFFICE OF INSPECTOR
TOO WAS SHARED BY THOSE WHO KNEW HOW TO COMBINE REASON WITH STRICTNESS
COMFORT WITH ECONOMY COMPASSION WITH UPRIGHTNESS
THE SCHOOL THUS
IMPROVED BECAME IN TIME A TRULY USEFUL AND NOBLE INSTITUTION
I
REMAINED AN INMATE OF ITS WALLS AFTER ITS REGENERATION FOR EIGHT YEARS
SIX AS PUPIL AND TWO AS TEACHER AND IN BOTH CAPACITIES I BEAR MY
TESTIMONY TO ITS VALUE AND IMPORTANCE
DURING THESE EIGHT YEARS MY LIFE WAS UNIFORM BUT NOT UNHAPPY BECAUSE IT
WAS NOT INACTIVE
I HAD THE MEANS OF AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION PLACED
WITHIN MY REACH A FONDNESS FOR SOME OF MY STUDIES AND A DESIRE TO EXCEL
IN ALL TOGETHER WITH A GREAT DELIGHT IN PLEASING MY TEACHERS ESPECIALLY
SUCH AS I LOVED URGED ME ON I AVAILED MYSELF FULLY OF THE ADVANTAGES
OFFERED ME
IN TIME I ROSE TO BE THE FIRST GIRL OF THE FIRST CLASS THEN
I WAS INVESTED WITH THE OFFICE OF TEACHER WHICH I DISCHARGED WITH ZEAL
FOR TWO YEARS BUT AT THE END OF THAT TIME I ALTERED
MISS TEMPLE THROUGH ALL CHANGES HAD THUS FAR CONTINUED SUPERINTENDENT
OF THE SEMINARY TO HER INSTRUCTION I OWED THE BEST PART OF MY
ACQUIREMENTS HER FRIENDSHIP AND SOCIETY HAD BEEN MY CONTINUAL SOLACE
SHE HAD STOOD ME IN THE STEAD OF MOTHER GOVERNESS AND LATTERLY
COMPANION
AT THIS PERIOD SHE MARRIED REMOVED WITH HER HUSBAND A
CLERGYMAN AN EXCELLENT MAN ALMOST WORTHY OF SUCH A WIFE TO A DISTANT
COUNTY AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS LOST TO ME
FROM THE DAY SHE LEFT I WAS NO LONGER THE SAME WITH HER WAS GONE EVERY
SETTLED FEELING EVERY ASSOCIATION THAT HAD MADE LOWOOD IN SOME DEGREE A
HOME TO ME
I HAD IMBIBED FROM HER SOMETHING OF HER NATURE AND MUCH OF
HER HABITS MORE HARMONIOUS THOUGHTS WHAT SEEMED BETTER REGULATED
FEELINGS HAD BECOME THE INMATES OF MY MIND
I HAD GIVEN IN ALLEGIANCE TO
DUTY AND ORDER I WAS QUIET I BELIEVED I WAS CONTENT TO THE EYES OF
OTHERS USUALLY EVEN TO MY OWN I APPEARED A DISCIPLINED AND SUBDUED
CHARACTER
BUT DESTINY IN THE SHAPE OF THE REV
MR
NASMYTH CAME BETWEEN ME AND
MISS TEMPLE I SAW HER IN HER TRAVELLING DRESS STEP INTO A POST CHAISE
SHORTLY AFTER THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY I WATCHED THE CHAISE MOUNT THE HILL
AND DISAPPEAR BEYOND ITS BROW AND THEN RETIRED TO MY OWN ROOM AND THERE
SPENT IN SOLITUDE THE GREATEST PART OF THE HALF HOLIDAY GRANTED IN HONOUR
OF THE OCCASION
I WALKED ABOUT THE CHAMBER MOST OF THE TIME
I IMAGINED MYSELF ONLY TO
BE REGRETTING MY LOSS AND THINKING HOW TO REPAIR IT BUT WHEN MY
REFLECTIONS WERE CONCLUDED AND I LOOKED UP AND FOUND THAT THE AFTERNOON
WAS GONE AND EVENING FAR ADVANCED ANOTHER DISCOVERY DAWNED ON ME
NAMELY THAT IN THE INTERVAL I HAD UNDERGONE A TRANSFORMING PROCESS THAT
MY MIND HAD PUT OFF ALL IT HAD BORROWED OF MISS TEMPLE OR RATHER THAT
SHE HAD TAKEN WITH HER THE SERENE ATMOSPHERE I HAD BEEN BREATHING IN HER
VICINITY AND THAT NOW I WAS LEFT IN MY NATURAL ELEMENT AND BEGINNING TO
FEEL THE STIRRING OF OLD EMOTIONS
IT DID NOT SEEM AS IF A PROP WERE
WITHDRAWN BUT RATHER AS IF A MOTIVE WERE GONE IT WAS NOT THE POWER TO
BE TRANQUIL WHICH HAD FAILED ME BUT THE REASON FOR TRANQUILLITY WAS NO
MORE
MY WORLD HAD FOR SOME YEARS BEEN IN LOWOOD MY EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN
OF ITS RULES AND SYSTEMS NOW I REMEMBERED THAT THE REAL WORLD WAS WIDE
AND THAT A VARIED FIELD OF HOPES AND FEARS OF SENSATIONS AND
EXCITEMENTS AWAITED THOSE WHO HAD COURAGE TO GO FORTH INTO ITS EXPANSE
TO SEEK REAL KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE AMIDST ITS PERILS
I WENT TO MY WINDOW OPENED IT AND LOOKED OUT
THERE WERE THE TWO WINGS
OF THE BUILDING THERE WAS THE GARDEN THERE WERE THE SKIRTS OF LOWOOD
THERE WAS THE HILLY HORIZON
MY EYE PASSED ALL OTHER OBJECTS TO REST ON
THOSE MOST REMOTE THE BLUE PEAKS IT WAS THOSE I LONGED TO SURMOUNT ALL
WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARY OF ROCK AND HEATH SEEMED PRISON GROUND EXILE
LIMITS
I TRACED THE WHITE ROAD WINDING ROUND THE BASE OF ONE MOUNTAIN
AND VANISHING IN A GORGE BETWEEN TWO HOW I LONGED TO FOLLOW IT FARTHER
I RECALLED THE TIME WHEN I HAD TRAVELLED THAT VERY ROAD IN A COACH I
REMEMBERED DESCENDING THAT HILL AT TWILIGHT AN AGE SEEMED TO HAVE
ELAPSED SINCE THE DAY WHICH BROUGHT ME FIRST TO LOWOOD AND I HAD NEVER
QUITTED IT SINCE
MY VACATIONS HAD ALL BEEN SPENT AT SCHOOL MRS
REED
HAD NEVER SENT FOR ME TO GATESHEAD NEITHER SHE NOR ANY OF HER FAMILY HAD
EVER BEEN TO VISIT ME
I HAD HAD NO COMMUNICATION BY LETTER OR MESSAGE
WITH THE OUTER WORLD SCHOOL RULES SCHOOL DUTIES SCHOOL HABITS AND
NOTIONS AND VOICES AND FACES AND PHRASES AND COSTUMES AND
PREFERENCES AND ANTIPATHIES SUCH WAS WHAT I KNEW OF EXISTENCE
AND NOW
I FELT THAT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH I TIRED OF THE ROUTINE OF EIGHT YEARS IN
ONE AFTERNOON
I DESIRED LIBERTY FOR LIBERTY I GASPED FOR LIBERTY I
UTTERED A PRAYER IT SEEMED SCATTERED ON THE WIND THEN FAINTLY BLOWING
I
ABANDONED IT AND FRAMED A HUMBLER SUPPLICATION FOR CHANGE STIMULUS
THAT PETITION TOO SEEMED SWEPT OFF INTO VAGUE SPACE THEN I CRIED
HALF DESPERATE GRANT ME AT LEAST A NEW SERVITUDE
HERE A BELL RINGING THE HOUR OF SUPPER CALLED ME DOWNSTAIRS
I WAS NOT FREE TO RESUME THE INTERRUPTED CHAIN OF MY REFLECTIONS TILL
BEDTIME EVEN THEN A TEACHER WHO OCCUPIED THE SAME ROOM WITH ME KEPT ME
FROM THE SUBJECT TO WHICH I LONGED TO RECUR BY A PROLONGED EFFUSION OF
SMALL TALK
HOW I WISHED SLEEP WOULD SILENCE HER
IT SEEMED AS IF
COULD I BUT GO BACK TO THE IDEA WHICH HAD LAST ENTERED MY MIND AS I STOOD
AT THE WINDOW SOME INVENTIVE SUGGESTION WOULD RISE FOR MY RELIEF
MISS GRYCE SNORED AT LAST SHE WAS A HEAVY WELSHWOMAN AND TILL NOW HER
HABITUAL NASAL STRAINS HAD NEVER BEEN REGARDED BY ME IN ANY OTHER LIGHT
THAN AS A NUISANCE TO NIGHT I HAILED THE FIRST DEEP NOTES WITH
SATISFACTION I WAS DEBARRASSED OF INTERRUPTION MY HALF EFFACED THOUGHT
INSTANTLY REVIVED
A NEW SERVITUDE THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT I SOLILOQUISED MENTALLY
BE IT UNDERSTOOD I DID NOT TALK ALOUD I KNOW THERE IS BECAUSE IT
DOES NOT SOUND TOO SWEET IT IS NOT LIKE SUCH WORDS AS LIBERTY
EXCITEMENT ENJOYMENT DELIGHTFUL SOUNDS TRULY BUT NO MORE THAN SOUNDS
FOR ME AND SO HOLLOW AND FLEETING THAT IT IS MERE WASTE OF TIME TO
LISTEN TO THEM
BUT SERVITUDE THAT MUST BE MATTER OF FACT
ANY ONE
MAY SERVE I HAVE SERVED HERE EIGHT YEARS NOW ALL I WANT IS TO SERVE
ELSEWHERE
CAN I NOT GET SO MUCH OF MY OWN WILL IS NOT THE THING
FEASIBLE YES YES THE END IS NOT SO DIFFICULT IF I HAD ONLY A BRAIN
ACTIVE ENOUGH TO FERRET OUT THE MEANS OF ATTAINING IT
I SAT UP IN BED BY WAY OF AROUSING THIS SAID BRAIN IT WAS A CHILLY
NIGHT I COVERED MY SHOULDERS WITH A SHAWL AND THEN I PROCEEDED TO
THINK AGAIN WITH ALL MY MIGHT
WHAT DO I WANT A NEW PLACE IN A NEW HOUSE AMONGST NEW FACES UNDER
NEW CIRCUMSTANCES I WANT THIS BECAUSE IT IS OF NO USE WANTING ANYTHING
BETTER
HOW DO PEOPLE DO TO GET A NEW PLACE THEY APPLY TO FRIENDS I
SUPPOSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS
THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE NO FRIENDS
WHO MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR THEMSELVES AND BE THEIR OWN HELPERS AND WHAT IS
THEIR RESOURCE
I COULD NOT TELL NOTHING ANSWERED ME I THEN ORDERED MY BRAIN TO FIND A
RESPONSE AND QUICKLY
IT WORKED AND WORKED FASTER I FELT THE PULSES
THROB IN MY HEAD AND TEMPLES BUT FOR NEARLY AN HOUR IT WORKED IN CHAOS
AND NO RESULT CAME OF ITS EFFORTS
FEVERISH WITH VAIN LABOUR I GOT UP
AND TOOK A TURN IN THE ROOM UNDREW THE CURTAIN NOTED A STAR OR TWO
SHIVERED WITH COLD AND AGAIN CREPT TO BED
A KIND FAIRY IN MY ABSENCE HAD SURELY DROPPED THE REQUIRED SUGGESTION
ON MY PILLOW FOR AS I LAY DOWN IT CAME QUIETLY AND NATURALLY TO MY
MIND THOSE WHO WANT SITUATIONS ADVERTISE YOU MUST ADVERTISE IN THE
SHIRE HERALD
HOW I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ADVERTISING
REPLIES ROSE SMOOTH AND PROMPT NOW
YOU MUST ENCLOSE THE ADVERTISEMENT AND THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT UNDER A
COVER DIRECTED TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD YOU MUST PUT IT THE FIRST
OPPORTUNITY YOU HAVE INTO THE POST AT LOWTON ANSWERS MUST BE ADDRESSED
TO J E AT THE POST OFFICE THERE YOU CAN GO AND INQUIRE IN ABOUT A WEEK
AFTER YOU SEND YOUR LETTER IF ANY ARE COME AND ACT ACCORDINGLY
THIS SCHEME I WENT OVER TWICE THRICE IT WAS THEN DIGESTED IN MY MIND I
HAD IT IN A CLEAR PRACTICAL FORM I FELT SATISFIED AND FELL ASLEEP
WITH EARLIEST DAY I WAS UP I HAD MY ADVERTISEMENT WRITTEN ENCLOSED
AND DIRECTED BEFORE THE BELL RANG TO ROUSE THE SCHOOL IT RAN THUS
A YOUNG LADY ACCUSTOMED TO TUITION HAD I NOT BEEN A TEACHER TWO
YEARS IS DESIROUS OF MEETING WITH A SITUATION IN A PRIVATE FAMILY
WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE UNDER FOURTEEN I THOUGHT THAT AS I WAS BARELY
EIGHTEEN IT WOULD NOT DO TO UNDERTAKE THE GUIDANCE OF PUPILS NEARER MY
OWN AGE
SHE IS QUALIFIED TO TEACH THE USUAL BRANCHES OF A GOOD ENGLISH
EDUCATION TOGETHER WITH FRENCH DRAWING AND MUSIC IN THOSE DAYS
READER THIS NOW NARROW CATALOGUE OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN
HELD TOLERABLY COMPREHENSIVE
ADDRESS J E POST OFFICE LOWTON
SHIRE
THIS DOCUMENT REMAINED LOCKED IN MY DRAWER ALL DAY AFTER TEA I ASKED
LEAVE OF THE NEW SUPERINTENDENT TO GO TO LOWTON IN ORDER TO PERFORM SOME
SMALL COMMISSIONS FOR MYSELF AND ONE OR TWO OF MY FELLOW TEACHERS
PERMISSION WAS READILY GRANTED I WENT
IT WAS A WALK OF TWO MILES AND
THE EVENING WAS WET BUT THE DAYS WERE STILL LONG I VISITED A SHOP OR
TWO SLIPPED THE LETTER INTO THE POST OFFICE AND CAME BACK THROUGH HEAVY
RAIN WITH STREAMING GARMENTS BUT WITH A RELIEVED HEART
THE SUCCEEDING WEEK SEEMED LONG IT CAME TO AN END AT LAST HOWEVER LIKE
ALL SUBLUNARY THINGS AND ONCE MORE TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF A PLEASANT
AUTUMN DAY I FOUND MYSELF AFOOT ON THE ROAD TO LOWTON
A PICTURESQUE
TRACK IT WAS BY THE WAY LYING ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BECK AND THROUGH
THE SWEETEST CURVES OF THE DALE BUT THAT DAY I THOUGHT MORE OF THE
LETTERS THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE AWAITING ME AT THE LITTLE BURGH
WHITHER I WAS BOUND THAN OF THE CHARMS OF LEA AND WATER
MY OSTENSIBLE ERRAND ON THIS OCCASION WAS TO GET MEASURED FOR A PAIR OF
SHOES SO I DISCHARGED THAT BUSINESS FIRST AND WHEN IT WAS DONE I
STEPPED ACROSS THE CLEAN AND QUIET LITTLE STREET FROM THE SHOEMAKER'S TO
THE POST OFFICE IT WAS KEPT BY AN OLD DAME WHO WORE HORN SPECTACLES ON
HER NOSE AND BLACK MITTENS ON HER HANDS
ARE THERE ANY LETTERS FOR J E I ASKED
SHE PEERED AT ME OVER HER SPECTACLES AND THEN SHE OPENED A DRAWER AND
FUMBLED AMONG ITS CONTENTS FOR A LONG TIME SO LONG THAT MY HOPES BEGAN
TO FALTER
AT LAST HAVING HELD A DOCUMENT BEFORE HER GLASSES FOR NEARLY
FIVE MINUTES SHE PRESENTED IT ACROSS THE COUNTER ACCOMPANYING THE ACT
BY ANOTHER INQUISITIVE AND MISTRUSTFUL GLANCE IT WAS FOR J E
IS THERE ONLY ONE I DEMANDED
THERE ARE NO MORE SAID SHE AND I PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND TURNED MY
FACE HOMEWARD I COULD NOT OPEN IT THEN RULES OBLIGED ME TO BE BACK BY
EIGHT AND IT WAS ALREADY HALF PAST SEVEN
VARIOUS DUTIES AWAITED ME ON MY ARRIVAL
I HAD TO SIT WITH THE GIRLS
DURING THEIR HOUR OF STUDY THEN IT WAS MY TURN TO READ PRAYERS TO SEE
THEM TO BED AFTERWARDS I SUPPED WITH THE OTHER TEACHERS
EVEN WHEN WE
FINALLY RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT THE INEVITABLE MISS GRYCE WAS STILL MY
COMPANION WE HAD ONLY A SHORT END OF CANDLE IN OUR CANDLESTICK AND I
DREADED LEST SHE SHOULD TALK TILL IT WAS ALL BURNT OUT FORTUNATELY
HOWEVER THE HEAVY SUPPER SHE HAD EATEN PRODUCED A SOPORIFIC EFFECT SHE
WAS ALREADY SNORING BEFORE I HAD FINISHED UNDRESSING
THERE STILL
REMAINED AN INCH OF CANDLE I NOW TOOK OUT MY LETTER THE SEAL WAS AN
INITIAL F I BROKE IT THE CONTENTS WERE BRIEF
IF J E WHO ADVERTISED IN THE SHIRE HERALD OF LAST THURSDAY
POSSESSES THE ACQUIREMENTS MENTIONED AND IF SHE IS IN A POSITION TO GIVE
SATISFACTORY REFERENCES AS TO CHARACTER AND COMPETENCY A SITUATION CAN
BE OFFERED HER WHERE THERE IS BUT ONE PUPIL A LITTLE GIRL UNDER TEN
YEARS OF AGE AND WHERE THE SALARY IS THIRTY POUNDS PER ANNUM
J E
IS
REQUESTED TO SEND REFERENCES NAME ADDRESS AND ALL PARTICULARS TO THE
DIRECTION
MRS
FAIRFAX THORNFIELD NEAR MILLCOTE SHIRE
I EXAMINED THE DOCUMENT LONG THE WRITING WAS OLD FASHIONED AND RATHER
UNCERTAIN LIKE THAT OF AN ELDERLY LADY
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS
SATISFACTORY A PRIVATE FEAR HAD HAUNTED ME THAT IN THUS ACTING FOR
MYSELF AND BY MY OWN GUIDANCE I RAN THE RISK OF GETTING INTO SOME
SCRAPE AND ABOVE ALL THINGS I WISHED THE RESULT OF MY ENDEAVOURS TO BE
RESPECTABLE PROPER EN REGLE
I NOW FELT THAT AN ELDERLY LADY WAS NO
BAD INGREDIENT IN THE BUSINESS I HAD ON HAND
MRS
FAIRFAX I SAW HER
IN A BLACK GOWN AND WIDOW'S CAP FRIGID PERHAPS BUT NOT UNCIVIL A
MODEL OF ELDERLY ENGLISH RESPECTABILITY
THORNFIELD THAT DOUBTLESS
WAS THE NAME OF HER HOUSE A NEAT ORDERLY SPOT I WAS SURE THOUGH I
FAILED IN MY EFFORTS TO CONCEIVE A CORRECT PLAN OF THE PREMISES
MILLCOTE SHIRE I BRUSHED UP MY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE MAP OF ENGLAND
YES I SAW IT BOTH THE SHIRE AND THE TOWN
SHIRE WAS SEVENTY MILES
NEARER LONDON THAN THE REMOTE COUNTY WHERE I NOW RESIDED THAT WAS A
RECOMMENDATION TO ME
I LONGED TO GO WHERE THERE WAS LIFE AND MOVEMENT
MILLCOTE WAS A LARGE MANUFACTURING TOWN ON THE BANKS OF THE A A BUSY
PLACE ENOUGH DOUBTLESS SO MUCH THE BETTER IT WOULD BE A COMPLETE
CHANGE AT LEAST
NOT THAT MY FANCY WAS MUCH CAPTIVATED BY THE IDEA OF
LONG CHIMNEYS AND CLOUDS OF SMOKE BUT I ARGUED THORNFIELD WILL
PROBABLY BE A GOOD WAY FROM THE TOWN
HERE THE SOCKET OF THE CANDLE DROPPED AND THE WICK WENT OUT
NEXT DAY NEW STEPS WERE TO BE TAKEN MY PLANS COULD NO LONGER BE CONFINED
TO MY OWN BREAST I MUST IMPART THEM IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THEIR SUCCESS
HAVING SOUGHT AND OBTAINED AN AUDIENCE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT DURING THE
NOONTIDE RECREATION I TOLD HER I HAD A PROSPECT OF GETTING A NEW
SITUATION WHERE THE SALARY WOULD BE DOUBLE WHAT I NOW RECEIVED FOR AT
LOWOOD I ONLY GOT 15 POUNDS PER ANNUM AND REQUESTED SHE WOULD BREAK THE
MATTER FOR ME TO MR
BROCKLEHURST OR SOME OF THE COMMITTEE AND
ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEY WOULD PERMIT ME TO MENTION THEM AS REFERENCES
SHE
OBLIGINGLY CONSENTED TO ACT AS MEDIATRIX IN THE MATTER
THE NEXT DAY SHE
LAID THE AFFAIR BEFORE MR
BROCKLEHURST WHO SAID THAT MRS
REED MUST BE
WRITTEN TO AS SHE WAS MY NATURAL GUARDIAN
A NOTE WAS ACCORDINGLY
ADDRESSED TO THAT LADY WHO RETURNED FOR ANSWER THAT I MIGHT DO AS I
PLEASED SHE HAD LONG RELINQUISHED ALL INTERFERENCE IN MY AFFAIRS THIS
NOTE WENT THE ROUND OF THE COMMITTEE AND AT LAST AFTER WHAT APPEARED TO
ME MOST TEDIOUS DELAY FORMAL LEAVE WAS GIVEN ME TO BETTER MY CONDITION
IF I COULD AND AN ASSURANCE ADDED THAT AS I HAD ALWAYS CONDUCTED MYSELF
WELL BOTH AS TEACHER AND PUPIL AT LOWOOD A TESTIMONIAL OF CHARACTER
AND CAPACITY SIGNED BY THE INSPECTORS OF THAT INSTITUTION SHOULD
FORTHWITH BE FURNISHED ME
THIS TESTIMONIAL I ACCORDINGLY RECEIVED IN ABOUT A MONTH FORWARDED A
COPY OF IT TO MRS
FAIRFAX AND GOT THAT LADY'S REPLY STATING THAT SHE
WAS SATISFIED AND FIXING THAT DAY FORTNIGHT AS THE PERIOD FOR MY
ASSUMING THE POST OF GOVERNESS IN HER HOUSE
I NOW BUSIED MYSELF IN PREPARATIONS THE FORTNIGHT PASSED RAPIDLY
I HAD
NOT A VERY LARGE WARDROBE THOUGH IT WAS ADEQUATE TO MY WANTS AND THE
LAST DAY SUFFICED TO PACK MY TRUNK THE SAME I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME EIGHT
YEARS AGO FROM GATESHEAD
THE BOX WAS CORDED THE CARD NAILED ON
IN HALF AN HOUR THE CARRIER WAS
TO CALL FOR IT TO TAKE IT TO LOWTON WHITHER I MYSELF WAS TO REPAIR AT AN
EARLY HOUR THE NEXT MORNING TO MEET THE COACH
I HAD BRUSHED MY BLACK
STUFF TRAVELLING DRESS PREPARED MY BONNET GLOVES AND MUFF SOUGHT IN
ALL MY DRAWERS TO SEE THAT NO ARTICLE WAS LEFT BEHIND AND NOW HAVING
NOTHING MORE TO DO I SAT DOWN AND TRIED TO REST
I COULD NOT THOUGH I
HAD BEEN ON FOOT ALL DAY I COULD NOT NOW REPOSE AN INSTANT I WAS TOO
MUCH EXCITED
A PHASE OF MY LIFE WAS CLOSING TO NIGHT A NEW ONE OPENING
TO MORROW IMPOSSIBLE TO SLUMBER IN THE INTERVAL I MUST WATCH FEVERISHLY
WHILE THE CHANGE WAS BEING ACCOMPLISHED
MISS SAID A SERVANT WHO MET ME IN THE LOBBY WHERE I WAS WANDERING
LIKE A TROUBLED SPIRIT A PERSON BELOW WISHES TO SEE YOU
THE CARRIER NO DOUBT I THOUGHT AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS WITHOUT INQUIRY
I
WAS PASSING THE BACK PARLOUR OR TEACHERS' SITTING ROOM THE DOOR OF WHICH
WAS HALF OPEN TO GO TO THE KITCHEN WHEN SOME ONE RAN OUT
IT'S HER I AM SURE I COULD HAVE TOLD HER ANYWHERE CRIED THE
INDIVIDUAL WHO STOPPED MY PROGRESS AND TOOK MY HAND
I LOOKED I SAW A WOMAN ATTIRED LIKE A WELL DRESSED SERVANT MATRONLY
YET STILL YOUNG VERY GOOD LOOKING WITH BLACK HAIR AND EYES AND LIVELY
COMPLEXION
WELL WHO IS IT SHE ASKED IN A VOICE AND WITH A SMILE I HALF
RECOGNISED YOU'VE NOT QUITE FORGOTTEN ME I THINK MISS JANE
IN ANOTHER SECOND I WAS EMBRACING AND KISSING HER RAPTUROUSLY BESSIE
BESSIE BESSIE THAT WAS ALL I SAID WHEREAT SHE HALF LAUGHED HALF
CRIED AND WE BOTH WENT INTO THE PARLOUR
BY THE FIRE STOOD A LITTLE
FELLOW OF THREE YEARS OLD IN PLAID FROCK AND TROUSERS
THAT IS MY LITTLE BOY SAID BESSIE DIRECTLY
THEN YOU ARE MARRIED BESSIE
YES NEARLY FIVE YEARS SINCE TO ROBERT LEAVEN THE COACHMAN AND I'VE A
LITTLE GIRL BESIDES BOBBY THERE THAT I'VE CHRISTENED JANE

YOU'RE NOT GROWN SO VERY TALL MISS JANE NOR SO VERY STOUT CONTINUED
MRS
LEAVEN
I DARE SAY THEY'VE NOT KEPT YOU TOO WELL AT SCHOOL MISS
REED IS THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS TALLER THAN YOU ARE AND MISS GEORGIANA
WOULD MAKE TWO OF YOU IN BREADTH
GEORGIANA IS HANDSOME I SUPPOSE BESSIE
VERY
SHE WENT UP TO LONDON LAST WINTER WITH HER MAMA AND THERE
EVERYBODY ADMIRED HER AND A YOUNG LORD FELL IN LOVE WITH HER BUT HIS
RELATIONS WERE AGAINST THE MATCH AND WHAT DO YOU THINK HE AND MISS
GEORGIANA MADE IT UP TO RUN AWAY BUT THEY WERE FOUND OUT AND STOPPED
IT
WAS MISS REED THAT FOUND THEM OUT I BELIEVE SHE WAS ENVIOUS AND NOW SHE
AND HER SISTER LEAD A CAT AND DOG LIFE TOGETHER THEY ARE ALWAYS
QUARRELLING
WELL AND WHAT OF JOHN REED
OH HE IS NOT DOING SO WELL AS HIS MAMA COULD WISH
HE WENT TO COLLEGE
AND HE GOT PLUCKED I THINK THEY CALL IT AND THEN HIS UNCLES WANTED HIM
TO BE A BARRISTER AND STUDY THE LAW BUT HE IS SUCH A DISSIPATED YOUNG
MAN THEY WILL NEVER MAKE MUCH OF HIM I THINK
WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE
HE IS VERY TALL SOME PEOPLE CALL HIM A FINE LOOKING YOUNG MAN BUT HE
HAS SUCH THICK LIPS
AND MRS
REED
MISSIS LOOKS STOUT AND WELL ENOUGH IN THE FACE BUT I THINK SHE'S NOT
QUITE EASY IN HER MIND MR
JOHN'S CONDUCT DOES NOT PLEASE HER HE SPENDS
A DEAL OF MONEY
DID SHE SEND YOU HERE BESSIE
NO INDEED BUT I HAVE LONG WANTED TO SEE YOU AND WHEN I HEARD THAT
THERE HAD BEEN A LETTER FROM YOU AND THAT YOU WERE GOING TO ANOTHER PART
OF THE COUNTRY I THOUGHT I'D JUST SET OFF AND GET A LOOK AT YOU BEFORE
YOU WERE QUITE OUT OF MY REACH
I AM AFRAID YOU ARE DISAPPOINTED IN ME BESSIE I SAID THIS LAUGHING
I PERCEIVED THAT BESSIE'S GLANCE THOUGH IT EXPRESSED REGARD DID IN NO
SHAPE DENOTE ADMIRATION
NO MISS JANE NOT EXACTLY YOU ARE GENTEEL ENOUGH YOU LOOK LIKE A
LADY AND IT IS AS MUCH AS EVER I EXPECTED OF YOU YOU WERE NO BEAUTY AS
A CHILD
I SMILED AT BESSIE'S FRANK ANSWER I FELT THAT IT WAS CORRECT BUT I
CONFESS I WAS NOT QUITE INDIFFERENT TO ITS IMPORT AT EIGHTEEN MOST
PEOPLE WISH TO PLEASE AND THE CONVICTION THAT THEY HAVE NOT AN EXTERIOR
LIKELY TO SECOND THAT DESIRE BRINGS ANYTHING BUT GRATIFICATION
I DARE SAY YOU ARE CLEVER THOUGH CONTINUED BESSIE BY WAY OF SOLACE
WHAT CAN YOU DO CAN YOU PLAY ON THE PIANO
A LITTLE
THERE WAS ONE IN THE ROOM BESSIE WENT AND OPENED IT AND THEN ASKED ME
TO SIT DOWN AND GIVE HER A TUNE I PLAYED A WALTZ OR TWO AND SHE WAS
CHARMED
THE MISS REEDS COULD NOT PLAY AS WELL SAID SHE EXULTINGLY
I ALWAYS
SAID YOU WOULD SURPASS THEM IN LEARNING AND CAN YOU DRAW
THAT IS ONE OF MY PAINTINGS OVER THE CHIMNEY PIECE IT WAS A LANDSCAPE
IN WATER COLOURS OF WHICH I HAD MADE A PRESENT TO THE SUPERINTENDENT IN
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HER OBLIGING MEDIATION WITH THE COMMITTEE ON MY BEHALF
AND WHICH SHE HAD FRAMED AND GLAZED
WELL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL MISS JANE IT IS AS FINE A PICTURE AS ANY MISS
REED'S DRAWING MASTER COULD PAINT LET ALONE THE YOUNG LADIES THEMSELVES
WHO COULD NOT COME NEAR IT AND HAVE YOU LEARNT FRENCH
YES BESSIE I CAN BOTH READ IT AND SPEAK IT
AND YOU CAN WORK ON MUSLIN AND CANVAS
I CAN
OH YOU ARE QUITE A LADY MISS JANE I KNEW YOU WOULD BE YOU WILL GET
ON WHETHER YOUR RELATIONS NOTICE YOU OR NOT
THERE WAS SOMETHING I
WANTED TO ASK YOU
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANYTHING FROM YOUR FATHER'S
KINSFOLK THE EYRES
NEVER IN MY LIFE
WELL YOU KNOW MISSIS ALWAYS SAID THEY WERE POOR AND QUITE DESPICABLE
AND THEY MAY BE POOR BUT I BELIEVE THEY ARE AS MUCH GENTRY AS THE REEDS
ARE FOR ONE DAY NEARLY SEVEN YEARS AGO A MR
EYRE CAME TO GATESHEAD
AND WANTED TO SEE YOU MISSIS SAID YOU WERE AT SCHOOL FIFTY MILES OFF HE
SEEMED SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED FOR HE COULD NOT STAY HE WAS GOING ON A
VOYAGE TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND THE SHIP WAS TO SAIL FROM LONDON IN A
DAY OR TWO
HE LOOKED QUITE A GENTLEMAN AND I BELIEVE HE WAS YOUR
FATHER'S BROTHER
WHAT FOREIGN COUNTRY WAS HE GOING TO BESSIE
AN ISLAND THOUSANDS OF MILES OFF WHERE THEY MAKE WINE THE BUTLER DID
TELL ME
MADEIRA I SUGGESTED
YES THAT IS IT THAT IS THE VERY WORD
SO HE WENT
YES HE DID NOT STAY MANY MINUTES IN THE HOUSE MISSIS WAS VERY HIGH
WITH HIM SHE CALLED HIM AFTERWARDS A 'SNEAKING TRADESMAN MY ROBERT
BELIEVES HE WAS A WINE MERCHANT
VERY LIKELY I RETURNED OR PERHAPS CLERK OR AGENT TO A
WINE MERCHANT
BESSIE AND I CONVERSED ABOUT OLD TIMES AN HOUR LONGER AND THEN SHE WAS
OBLIGED TO LEAVE ME I SAW HER AGAIN FOR A FEW MINUTES THE NEXT MORNING
AT LOWTON WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR THE COACH
WE PARTED FINALLY AT THE
DOOR OF THE BROCKLEHURST ARMS THERE EACH WENT HER SEPARATE WAY SHE SET
OFF FOR THE BROW OF LOWOOD FELL TO MEET THE CONVEYANCE WHICH WAS TO TAKE
HER BACK TO GATESHEAD I MOUNTED THE VEHICLE WHICH WAS TO BEAR ME TO NEW
DUTIES AND A NEW LIFE IN THE UNKNOWN ENVIRONS OF MILLCOTE
CHAPTER XI
A NEW CHAPTER IN A NOVEL IS SOMETHING LIKE A NEW SCENE IN A PLAY AND
WHEN I DRAW UP THE CURTAIN THIS TIME READER YOU MUST FANCY YOU SEE A
ROOM IN THE GEORGE INN AT MILLCOTE WITH SUCH LARGE FIGURED PAPERING ON
THE WALLS AS INN ROOMS HAVE SUCH A CARPET SUCH FURNITURE SUCH
ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE SUCH PRINTS INCLUDING A PORTRAIT OF GEORGE
THE THIRD AND ANOTHER OF THE PRINCE OF WALES AND A REPRESENTATION OF
THE DEATH OF WOLFE
ALL THIS IS VISIBLE TO YOU BY THE LIGHT OF AN OIL
LAMP HANGING FROM THE CEILING AND BY THAT OF AN EXCELLENT FIRE NEAR
WHICH I SIT IN MY CLOAK AND BONNET MY MUFF AND UMBRELLA LIE ON THE
TABLE AND I AM WARMING AWAY THE NUMBNESS AND CHILL CONTRACTED BY SIXTEEN
HOURS' EXPOSURE TO THE RAWNESS OF AN OCTOBER DAY I LEFT LOWTON AT FOUR
O'CLOCK A M AND THE MILLCOTE TOWN CLOCK IS NOW JUST STRIKING EIGHT
READER THOUGH I LOOK COMFORTABLY ACCOMMODATED I AM NOT VERY TRANQUIL IN
MY MIND
I THOUGHT WHEN THE COACH STOPPED HERE THERE WOULD BE SOME ONE
TO MEET ME I LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ROUND AS I DESCENDED THE WOODEN STEPS THE
BOOTS PLACED FOR MY CONVENIENCE EXPECTING TO HEAR MY NAME PRONOUNCED
AND TO SEE SOME DESCRIPTION OF CARRIAGE WAITING TO CONVEY ME TO
THORNFIELD
NOTHING OF THE SORT WAS VISIBLE AND WHEN I ASKED A WAITER
IF ANY ONE HAD BEEN TO INQUIRE AFTER A MISS EYRE I WAS ANSWERED IN THE
NEGATIVE SO I HAD NO RESOURCE BUT TO REQUEST TO BE SHOWN INTO A PRIVATE
ROOM AND HERE I AM WAITING WHILE ALL SORTS OF DOUBTS AND FEARS ARE
TROUBLING MY THOUGHTS
IT IS A VERY STRANGE SENSATION TO INEXPERIENCED YOUTH TO FEEL ITSELF
QUITE ALONE IN THE WORLD CUT ADRIFT FROM EVERY CONNECTION UNCERTAIN
WHETHER THE PORT TO WHICH IT IS BOUND CAN BE REACHED AND PREVENTED BY
MANY IMPEDIMENTS FROM RETURNING TO THAT IT HAS QUITTED
THE CHARM OF
ADVENTURE SWEETENS THAT SENSATION THE GLOW OF PRIDE WARMS IT BUT THEN
THE THROB OF FEAR DISTURBS IT AND FEAR WITH ME BECAME PREDOMINANT WHEN
HALF AN HOUR ELAPSED AND STILL I WAS ALONE
I BETHOUGHT MYSELF TO RING
THE BELL
IS THERE A PLACE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD CALLED THORNFIELD I ASKED OF
THE WAITER WHO ANSWERED THE SUMMONS
THORNFIELD I DON'T KNOW MA'AM I'LL INQUIRE AT THE BAR HE
VANISHED BUT REAPPEARED INSTANTLY
IS YOUR NAME EYRE MISS
YES
PERSON HERE WAITING FOR YOU
I JUMPED UP TOOK MY MUFF AND UMBRELLA AND HASTENED INTO THE
INN PASSAGE A MAN WAS STANDING BY THE OPEN DOOR AND IN THE LAMP LIT
STREET I DIMLY SAW A ONE HORSE CONVEYANCE
THIS WILL BE YOUR LUGGAGE I SUPPOSE SAID THE MAN RATHER ABRUPTLY WHEN
HE SAW ME POINTING TO MY TRUNK IN THE PASSAGE
YES HE HOISTED IT ON TO THE VEHICLE WHICH WAS A SORT OF CAR AND
THEN I GOT IN BEFORE HE SHUT ME UP I ASKED HIM HOW FAR IT WAS TO
THORNFIELD
A MATTER OF SIX MILES
HOW LONG SHALL WE BE BEFORE WE GET THERE
HAPPEN AN HOUR AND A HALF
HE FASTENED THE CAR DOOR CLIMBED TO HIS OWN SEAT OUTSIDE AND WE SET
OFF
OUR PROGRESS WAS LEISURELY AND GAVE ME AMPLE TIME TO REFLECT I
WAS CONTENT TO BE AT LENGTH SO NEAR THE END OF MY JOURNEY AND AS I
LEANED BACK IN THE COMFORTABLE THOUGH NOT ELEGANT CONVEYANCE I MEDITATED
MUCH AT MY EASE
I SUPPOSE THOUGHT I JUDGING FROM THE PLAINNESS OF THE SERVANT AND
CARRIAGE MRS
FAIRFAX IS NOT A VERY DASHING PERSON SO MUCH THE BETTER
I NEVER LIVED AMONGST FINE PEOPLE BUT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE WITH
THEM
I WONDER IF SHE LIVES ALONE EXCEPT THIS LITTLE GIRL IF SO AND IF
SHE IS IN ANY DEGREE AMIABLE I SHALL SURELY BE ABLE TO GET ON WITH HER
I WILL DO MY BEST IT IS A PITY THAT DOING ONE'S BEST DOES NOT ALWAYS
ANSWER
AT LOWOOD INDEED I TOOK THAT RESOLUTION KEPT IT AND
SUCCEEDED IN PLEASING BUT WITH MRS
REED I REMEMBER MY BEST WAS ALWAYS
SPURNED WITH SCORN
I PRAY GOD MRS
FAIRFAX MAY NOT TURN OUT A SECOND
MRS
REED BUT IF SHE DOES I AM NOT BOUND TO STAY WITH HER LET THE
WORST COME TO THE WORST I CAN ADVERTISE AGAIN
HOW FAR ARE WE ON OUR
ROAD NOW I WONDER
I LET DOWN THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT MILLCOTE WAS BEHIND US JUDGING BY
THE NUMBER OF ITS LIGHTS IT SEEMED A PLACE OF CONSIDERABLE MAGNITUDE
MUCH LARGER THAN LOWTON
WE WERE NOW AS FAR AS I COULD SEE ON A SORT
OF COMMON BUT THERE WERE HOUSES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE DISTRICT I FELT
WE WERE IN A DIFFERENT REGION TO LOWOOD MORE POPULOUS LESS PICTURESQUE
MORE STIRRING LESS ROMANTIC
THE ROADS WERE HEAVY THE NIGHT MISTY MY CONDUCTOR LET HIS HORSE WALK
ALL THE WAY AND THE HOUR AND A HALF EXTENDED I VERILY BELIEVE TO TWO
HOURS AT LAST HE TURNED IN HIS SEAT AND SAID
YOU'RE NOAN SO FAR FRO' THORNFIELD NOW
AGAIN I LOOKED OUT WE WERE PASSING A CHURCH I SAW ITS LOW BROAD TOWER
AGAINST THE SKY AND ITS BELL WAS TOLLING A QUARTER I SAW A NARROW
GALAXY OF LIGHTS TOO ON A HILLSIDE MARKING A VILLAGE OR HAMLET
ABOUT
TEN MINUTES AFTER THE DRIVER GOT DOWN AND OPENED A PAIR OF GATES WE
PASSED THROUGH AND THEY CLASHED TO BEHIND US
WE NOW SLOWLY ASCENDED A
DRIVE AND CAME UPON THE LONG FRONT OF A HOUSE CANDLELIGHT GLEAMED FROM
ONE CURTAINED BOW WINDOW ALL THE REST WERE DARK
THE CAR STOPPED AT THE
FRONT DOOR IT WAS OPENED BY A MAID SERVANT I ALIGHTED AND WENT IN
WILL YOU WALK THIS WAY MA'AM SAID THE GIRL AND I FOLLOWED HER ACROSS
A SQUARE HALL WITH HIGH DOORS ALL ROUND SHE USHERED ME INTO A ROOM WHOSE
DOUBLE ILLUMINATION OF FIRE AND CANDLE AT FIRST DAZZLED ME CONTRASTING
AS IT DID WITH THE DARKNESS TO WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN FOR TWO HOURS
INURED WHEN I COULD SEE HOWEVER A COSY AND AGREEABLE PICTURE PRESENTED
ITSELF TO MY VIEW
A SNUG SMALL ROOM A ROUND TABLE BY A CHEERFUL FIRE AN ARM CHAIR HIGH
BACKED AND OLD FASHIONED WHEREIN SAT THE NEATEST IMAGINABLE LITTLE
ELDERLY LADY IN WIDOW'S CAP BLACK SILK GOWN AND SNOWY MUSLIN APRON
EXACTLY LIKE WHAT I HAD FANCIED MRS
FAIRFAX ONLY LESS STATELY AND
MILDER LOOKING
SHE WAS OCCUPIED IN KNITTING A LARGE CAT SAT DEMURELY
AT HER FEET NOTHING IN SHORT WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THE BEAU IDEAL OF
DOMESTIC COMFORT
A MORE REASSURING INTRODUCTION FOR A NEW GOVERNESS
COULD SCARCELY BE CONCEIVED THERE WAS NO GRANDEUR TO OVERWHELM NO
STATELINESS TO EMBARRASS AND THEN AS I ENTERED THE OLD LADY GOT UP AND
PROMPTLY AND KINDLY CAME FORWARD TO MEET ME
HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE HAD A TEDIOUS RIDE JOHN
DRIVES SO SLOWLY YOU MUST BE COLD COME TO THE FIRE
MRS
FAIRFAX I SUPPOSE SAID I
YES YOU ARE RIGHT DO SIT DOWN
SHE CONDUCTED ME TO HER OWN CHAIR AND THEN BEGAN TO REMOVE MY SHAWL AND
UNTIE MY BONNET STRINGS I BEGGED SHE WOULD NOT GIVE HERSELF SO MUCH
TROUBLE
OH IT IS NO TROUBLE I DARE SAY YOUR OWN HANDS ARE ALMOST NUMBED WITH
COLD
LEAH MAKE A LITTLE HOT NEGUS AND CUT A SANDWICH OR TWO HERE ARE
THE KEYS OF THE STOREROOM
AND SHE PRODUCED FROM HER POCKET A MOST HOUSEWIFELY BUNCH OF KEYS AND
DELIVERED THEM TO THE SERVANT
NOW THEN DRAW NEARER TO THE FIRE SHE CONTINUED
YOU'VE BROUGHT
YOUR LUGGAGE WITH YOU HAVEN'T YOU MY DEAR
YES MA'AM
I'LL SEE IT CARRIED INTO YOUR ROOM SHE SAID AND BUSTLED OUT
SHE TREATS ME LIKE A VISITOR THOUGHT I
I LITTLE EXPECTED SUCH A
RECEPTION I ANTICIPATED ONLY COLDNESS AND STIFFNESS THIS IS NOT LIKE
WHAT I HAVE HEARD OF THE TREATMENT OF GOVERNESSES BUT I MUST NOT EXULT
TOO SOON
SHE RETURNED WITH HER OWN HANDS CLEARED HER KNITTING APPARATUS AND A
BOOK OR TWO FROM THE TABLE TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE TRAY WHICH LEAH NOW
BROUGHT AND THEN HERSELF HANDED ME THE REFRESHMENTS
I FELT RATHER
CONFUSED AT BEING THE OBJECT OF MORE ATTENTION THAN I HAD EVER BEFORE
RECEIVED AND THAT TOO SHOWN BY MY EMPLOYER AND SUPERIOR BUT AS SHE
DID NOT HERSELF SEEM TO CONSIDER SHE WAS DOING ANYTHING OUT OF HER PLACE
I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO TAKE HER CIVILITIES QUIETLY
SHALL I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING MISS FAIRFAX TO NIGHT I ASKED
WHEN I HAD PARTAKEN OF WHAT SHE OFFERED ME
WHAT DID YOU SAY MY DEAR I AM A LITTLE DEAF RETURNED THE GOOD LADY
APPROACHING HER EAR TO MY MOUTH
I REPEATED THE QUESTION MORE DISTINCTLY
MISS FAIRFAX OH YOU MEAN MISS VARENS VARENS IS THE NAME OF YOUR
FUTURE PUPIL
INDEED THEN SHE IS NOT YOUR DAUGHTER
NO I HAVE NO FAMILY
I SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED UP MY FIRST INQUIRY BY ASKING IN WHAT WAY MISS
VARENS WAS CONNECTED WITH HER BUT I RECOLLECTED IT WAS NOT POLITE TO ASK
TOO MANY QUESTIONS BESIDES I WAS SURE TO HEAR IN TIME
I AM SO GLAD SHE CONTINUED AS SHE SAT DOWN OPPOSITE TO ME AND TOOK
THE CAT ON HER KNEE I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE COME IT WILL BE QUITE
PLEASANT LIVING HERE NOW WITH A COMPANION
TO BE SURE IT IS PLEASANT AT
ANY TIME FOR THORNFIELD IS A FINE OLD HALL RATHER NEGLECTED OF LATE
YEARS PERHAPS BUT STILL IT IS A RESPECTABLE PLACE YET YOU KNOW IN
WINTER TIME ONE FEELS DREARY QUITE ALONE IN THE BEST QUARTERS
I SAY
ALONE LEAH IS A NICE GIRL TO BE SURE AND JOHN AND HIS WIFE ARE VERY
DECENT PEOPLE BUT THEN YOU SEE THEY ARE ONLY SERVANTS AND ONE CAN'T
CONVERSE WITH THEM ON TERMS OF EQUALITY ONE MUST KEEP THEM AT DUE
DISTANCE FOR FEAR OF LOSING ONE'S AUTHORITY
I'M SURE LAST WINTER IT
WAS A VERY SEVERE ONE IF YOU RECOLLECT AND WHEN IT DID NOT SNOW IT
RAINED AND BLEW NOT A CREATURE BUT THE BUTCHER AND POSTMAN CAME TO THE
HOUSE FROM NOVEMBER TILL FEBRUARY AND I REALLY GOT QUITE MELANCHOLY
WITH SITTING NIGHT AFTER NIGHT ALONE I HAD LEAH IN TO READ TO ME
SOMETIMES BUT I DON'T THINK THE POOR GIRL LIKED THE TASK MUCH SHE FELT
IT CONFINING
IN SPRING AND SUMMER ONE GOT ON BETTER SUNSHINE AND LONG
DAYS MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE AND THEN JUST AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THIS
AUTUMN LITTLE ADELA VARENS CAME AND HER NURSE A CHILD MAKES A HOUSE
ALIVE ALL AT ONCE AND NOW YOU ARE HERE I SHALL BE QUITE GAY
MY HEART REALLY WARMED TO THE WORTHY LADY AS I HEARD HER TALK AND I DREW
MY CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER TO HER AND EXPRESSED MY SINCERE WISH THAT SHE
MIGHT FIND MY COMPANY AS AGREEABLE AS SHE ANTICIPATED
BUT I'LL NOT KEEP YOU SITTING UP LATE TO NIGHT SAID SHE IT IS ON THE
STROKE OF TWELVE NOW AND YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING ALL DAY YOU MUST FEEL
TIRED
IF YOU HAVE GOT YOUR FEET WELL WARMED I'LL SHOW YOU YOUR
BEDROOM
I'VE HAD THE ROOM NEXT TO MINE PREPARED FOR YOU IT IS ONLY A
SMALL APARTMENT BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE IT BETTER THAN ONE OF THE
LARGE FRONT CHAMBERS TO BE SURE THEY HAVE FINER FURNITURE BUT THEY ARE
SO DREARY AND SOLITARY I NEVER SLEEP IN THEM MYSELF
I THANKED HER FOR HER CONSIDERATE CHOICE AND AS I REALLY FELT FATIGUED
WITH MY LONG JOURNEY EXPRESSED MY READINESS TO RETIRE
SHE TOOK HER
CANDLE AND I FOLLOWED HER FROM THE ROOM
FIRST SHE WENT TO SEE IF THE
HALL DOOR WAS FASTENED HAVING TAKEN THE KEY FROM THE LOCK SHE LED THE
WAY UPSTAIRS
THE STEPS AND BANISTERS WERE OF OAK THE STAIRCASE WINDOW
WAS HIGH AND LATTICED BOTH IT AND THE LONG GALLERY INTO WHICH THE
BEDROOM DOORS OPENED LOOKED AS IF THEY BELONGED TO A CHURCH RATHER THAN A
HOUSE
A VERY CHILL AND VAULT LIKE AIR PERVADED THE STAIRS AND GALLERY
SUGGESTING CHEERLESS IDEAS OF SPACE AND SOLITUDE AND I WAS GLAD WHEN
FINALLY USHERED INTO MY CHAMBER TO FIND IT OF SMALL DIMENSIONS AND
FURNISHED IN ORDINARY MODERN STYLE
WHEN MRS
FAIRFAX HAD BIDDEN ME A KIND GOOD NIGHT AND I HAD FASTENED MY
DOOR GAZED LEISURELY ROUND AND IN SOME MEASURE EFFACED THE EERIE
IMPRESSION MADE BY THAT WIDE HALL THAT DARK AND SPACIOUS STAIRCASE AND
THAT LONG COLD GALLERY BY THE LIVELIER ASPECT OF MY LITTLE ROOM I
REMEMBERED THAT AFTER A DAY OF BODILY FATIGUE AND MENTAL ANXIETY I WAS
NOW AT LAST IN SAFE HAVEN
THE IMPULSE OF GRATITUDE SWELLED MY HEART
AND I KNELT DOWN AT THE BEDSIDE AND OFFERED UP THANKS WHERE THANKS WERE
DUE NOT FORGETTING ERE I ROSE TO IMPLORE AID ON MY FURTHER PATH AND
THE POWER OF MERITING THE KINDNESS WHICH SEEMED SO FRANKLY OFFERED ME
BEFORE IT WAS EARNED
MY COUCH HAD NO THORNS IN IT THAT NIGHT MY
SOLITARY ROOM NO FEARS
AT ONCE WEARY AND CONTENT I SLEPT SOON AND
SOUNDLY WHEN I AWOKE IT WAS BROAD DAY
THE CHAMBER LOOKED SUCH A BRIGHT LITTLE PLACE TO ME AS THE SUN SHONE IN
BETWEEN THE GAY BLUE CHINTZ WINDOW CURTAINS SHOWING PAPERED WALLS AND A
CARPETED FLOOR SO UNLIKE THE BARE PLANKS AND STAINED PLASTER OF LOWOOD
THAT MY SPIRITS ROSE AT THE VIEW
EXTERNALS HAVE A GREAT EFFECT ON THE
YOUNG I THOUGHT THAT A FAIRER ERA OF LIFE WAS BEGINNING FOR ME ONE THAT
WAS TO HAVE ITS FLOWERS AND PLEASURES AS WELL AS ITS THORNS AND TOILS
MY FACULTIES ROUSED BY THE CHANGE OF SCENE THE NEW FIELD OFFERED TO
HOPE SEEMED ALL ASTIR
I CANNOT PRECISELY DEFINE WHAT THEY EXPECTED
BUT IT WAS SOMETHING PLEASANT NOT PERHAPS THAT DAY OR THAT MONTH BUT AT
AN INDEFINITE FUTURE PERIOD
I ROSE I DRESSED MYSELF WITH CARE OBLIGED TO BE PLAIN FOR I HAD NO
ARTICLE OF ATTIRE THAT WAS NOT MADE WITH EXTREME SIMPLICITY I WAS STILL
BY NATURE SOLICITOUS TO BE NEAT
IT WAS NOT MY HABIT TO BE DISREGARDFUL
OF APPEARANCE OR CARELESS OF THE IMPRESSION I MADE ON THE CONTRARY I
EVER WISHED TO LOOK AS WELL AS I COULD AND TO PLEASE AS MUCH AS MY WANT
OF BEAUTY WOULD PERMIT
I SOMETIMES REGRETTED THAT I WAS NOT HANDSOMER
I SOMETIMES WISHED TO HAVE ROSY CHEEKS A STRAIGHT NOSE AND SMALL CHERRY
MOUTH I DESIRED TO BE TALL STATELY AND FINELY DEVELOPED IN FIGURE I
FELT IT A MISFORTUNE THAT I WAS SO LITTLE SO PALE AND HAD FEATURES SO
IRREGULAR AND SO MARKED
AND WHY HAD I THESE ASPIRATIONS AND THESE
REGRETS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY I COULD NOT THEN DISTINCTLY SAY
IT TO MYSELF YET I HAD A REASON AND A LOGICAL NATURAL REASON TOO
HOWEVER WHEN I HAD BRUSHED MY HAIR VERY SMOOTH AND PUT ON MY BLACK
FROCK WHICH QUAKERLIKE AS IT WAS AT LEAST HAD THE MERIT OF FITTING TO
A NICETY AND ADJUSTED MY CLEAN WHITE TUCKER I THOUGHT I SHOULD DO
RESPECTABLY ENOUGH TO APPEAR BEFORE MRS
FAIRFAX AND THAT MY NEW PUPIL
WOULD NOT AT LEAST RECOIL FROM ME WITH ANTIPATHY
HAVING OPENED MY
CHAMBER WINDOW AND SEEN THAT I LEFT ALL THINGS STRAIGHT AND NEAT ON THE
TOILET TABLE I VENTURED FORTH
TRAVERSING THE LONG AND MATTED GALLERY I DESCENDED THE SLIPPERY STEPS OF
OAK THEN I GAINED THE HALL I HALTED THERE A MINUTE I LOOKED AT SOME
PICTURES ON THE WALLS ONE I REMEMBER REPRESENTED A GRIM MAN IN A
CUIRASS AND ONE A LADY WITH POWDERED HAIR AND A PEARL NECKLACE AT A
BRONZE LAMP PENDENT FROM THE CEILING AT A GREAT CLOCK WHOSE CASE WAS OF
OAK CURIOUSLY CARVED AND EBON BLACK WITH TIME AND RUBBING
EVERYTHING
APPEARED VERY STATELY AND IMPOSING TO ME BUT THEN I WAS SO LITTLE
ACCUSTOMED TO GRANDEUR
THE HALL DOOR WHICH WAS HALF OF GLASS STOOD
OPEN I STEPPED OVER THE THRESHOLD
IT WAS A FINE AUTUMN MORNING THE
EARLY SUN SHONE SERENELY ON EMBROWNED GROVES AND STILL GREEN FIELDS
ADVANCING ON TO THE LAWN I LOOKED UP AND SURVEYED THE FRONT OF THE
MANSION
IT WAS THREE STOREYS HIGH OF PROPORTIONS NOT VAST THOUGH
CONSIDERABLE A GENTLEMAN'S MANOR HOUSE NOT A NOBLEMAN'S SEAT
BATTLEMENTS ROUND THE TOP GAVE IT A PICTURESQUE LOOK
ITS GREY FRONT
STOOD OUT WELL FROM THE BACKGROUND OF A ROOKERY WHOSE CAWING TENANTS
WERE NOW ON THE WING THEY FLEW OVER THE LAWN AND GROUNDS TO ALIGHT IN A
GREAT MEADOW FROM WHICH THESE WERE SEPARATED BY A SUNK FENCE AND WHERE
AN ARRAY OF MIGHTY OLD THORN TREES STRONG KNOTTY AND BROAD AS OAKS AT
ONCE EXPLAINED THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE MANSION'S DESIGNATION
FARTHER OFF
WERE HILLS NOT SO LOFTY AS THOSE ROUND LOWOOD NOR SO CRAGGY NOR SO
LIKE BARRIERS OF SEPARATION FROM THE LIVING WORLD BUT YET QUIET AND
LONELY HILLS ENOUGH AND SEEMING TO EMBRACE THORNFIELD WITH A SECLUSION I
HAD NOT EXPECTED TO FIND EXISTENT SO NEAR THE STIRRING LOCALITY OF
MILLCOTE
A LITTLE HAMLET WHOSE ROOFS WERE BLENT WITH TREES STRAGGLED
UP THE SIDE OF ONE OF THESE HILLS THE CHURCH OF THE DISTRICT STOOD
NEARER THORNFIELD ITS OLD TOWER TOP LOOKED OVER A KNOLL BETWEEN THE
HOUSE AND GATES
I WAS YET ENJOYING THE CALM PROSPECT AND PLEASANT FRESH AIR YET
LISTENING WITH DELIGHT TO THE CAWING OF THE ROOKS YET SURVEYING THE
WIDE HOARY FRONT OF THE HALL AND THINKING WHAT A GREAT PLACE IT WAS FOR
ONE LONELY LITTLE DAME LIKE MRS
FAIRFAX TO INHABIT WHEN THAT LADY
APPEARED AT THE DOOR
WHAT OUT ALREADY SAID SHE
I SEE YOU ARE AN EARLY RISER I WENT
UP TO HER AND WAS RECEIVED WITH AN AFFABLE KISS AND SHAKE OF THE HAND
HOW DO YOU LIKE THORNFIELD SHE ASKED
I TOLD HER I LIKED IT VERY
MUCH
YES SHE SAID IT IS A PRETTY PLACE BUT I FEAR IT WILL BE GETTING OUT
OF ORDER UNLESS MR
ROCHESTER SHOULD TAKE IT INTO HIS HEAD TO COME AND
RESIDE HERE PERMANENTLY OR AT LEAST VISIT IT RATHER OFTENER GREAT
HOUSES AND FINE GROUNDS REQUIRE THE PRESENCE OF THE PROPRIETOR
MR
ROCHESTER I EXCLAIMED
WHO IS HE
THE OWNER OF THORNFIELD SHE RESPONDED QUIETLY
DID YOU NOT KNOW HE
WAS CALLED ROCHESTER
OF COURSE I DID NOT I HAD NEVER HEARD OF HIM BEFORE BUT THE OLD LADY
SEEMED TO REGARD HIS EXISTENCE AS A UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD FACT WITH
WHICH EVERYBODY MUST BE ACQUAINTED BY INSTINCT
I THOUGHT I CONTINUED THORNFIELD BELONGED TO YOU
TO ME BLESS YOU CHILD WHAT AN IDEA TO ME I AM ONLY THE
HOUSEKEEPER THE MANAGER
TO BE SURE I AM DISTANTLY RELATED TO THE
ROCHESTERS BY THE MOTHER'S SIDE OR AT LEAST MY HUSBAND WAS HE WAS A
CLERGYMAN INCUMBENT OF HAY THAT LITTLE VILLAGE YONDER ON THE HILL AND
THAT CHURCH NEAR THE GATES WAS HIS
THE PRESENT MR
ROCHESTER'S MOTHER
WAS A FAIRFAX AND SECOND COUSIN TO MY HUSBAND BUT I NEVER PRESUME ON
THE CONNECTION IN FACT IT IS NOTHING TO ME I CONSIDER MYSELF QUITE IN
THE LIGHT OF AN ORDINARY HOUSEKEEPER MY EMPLOYER IS ALWAYS CIVIL AND I
EXPECT NOTHING MORE
AND THE LITTLE GIRL MY PUPIL
SHE IS MR
ROCHESTER'S WARD HE COMMISSIONED ME TO FIND A GOVERNESS FOR
HER
HE INTENDED TO HAVE HER BROUGHT UP IN SHIRE I BELIEVE
HERE
SHE COMES WITH HER 'BONNE AS SHE CALLS HER NURSE THE ENIGMA THEN
WAS EXPLAINED THIS AFFABLE AND KIND LITTLE WIDOW WAS NO GREAT DAME BUT
A DEPENDANT LIKE MYSELF
I DID NOT LIKE HER THE WORSE FOR THAT ON THE
CONTRARY I FELT BETTER PLEASED THAN EVER
THE EQUALITY BETWEEN HER AND
ME WAS REAL NOT THE MERE RESULT OF CONDESCENSION ON HER PART SO MUCH
THE BETTER MY POSITION WAS ALL THE FREER
AS I WAS MEDITATING ON THIS DISCOVERY A LITTLE GIRL FOLLOWED BY HER
ATTENDANT CAME RUNNING UP THE LAWN
I LOOKED AT MY PUPIL WHO DID NOT
AT FIRST APPEAR TO NOTICE ME SHE WAS QUITE A CHILD PERHAPS SEVEN OR
EIGHT YEARS OLD SLIGHTLY BUILT WITH A PALE SMALL FEATURED FACE AND A
REDUNDANCY OF HAIR FALLING IN CURLS TO HER WAIST
GOOD MORNING MISS ADELA SAID MRS
FAIRFAX
COME AND SPEAK TO THE
LADY WHO IS TO TEACH YOU AND TO MAKE YOU A CLEVER WOMAN SOME DAY SHE
APPROACHED
C'EST LA MA GOUVERANTE SAID SHE POINTING TO ME AND ADDRESSING HER
NURSE WHO ANSWERED
MAIS OUI CERTAINEMENT
ARE THEY FOREIGNERS I INQUIRED AMAZED AT HEARING THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
THE NURSE IS A FOREIGNER AND ADELA WAS BORN ON THE CONTINENT AND I
BELIEVE NEVER LEFT IT TILL WITHIN SIX MONTHS AGO
WHEN SHE FIRST CAME
HERE SHE COULD SPEAK NO ENGLISH NOW SHE CAN MAKE SHIFT TO TALK IT A
LITTLE I DON'T UNDERSTAND HER SHE MIXES IT SO WITH FRENCH BUT YOU WILL
MAKE OUT HER MEANING VERY WELL I DARE SAY
FORTUNATELY I HAD HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING TAUGHT FRENCH BY A FRENCH
LADY AND AS I HAD ALWAYS MADE A POINT OF CONVERSING WITH MADAME PIERROT
AS OFTEN AS I COULD AND HAD BESIDES DURING THE LAST SEVEN YEARS LEARNT
A PORTION OF FRENCH BY HEART DAILY APPLYING MYSELF TO TAKE PAINS WITH MY
ACCENT AND IMITATING AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE THE PRONUNCIATION OF MY
TEACHER I HAD ACQUIRED A CERTAIN DEGREE OF READINESS AND CORRECTNESS IN
THE LANGUAGE AND WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE MUCH AT A LOSS WITH MADEMOISELLE
ADELA
SHE CAME AND SHOOK HAND WITH ME WHEN SHE HEARD THAT I WAS HER
GOVERNESS AND AS I LED HER IN TO BREAKFAST I ADDRESSED SOME PHRASES TO
HER IN HER OWN TONGUE SHE REPLIED BRIEFLY AT FIRST BUT AFTER WE WERE
SEATED AT THE TABLE AND SHE HAD EXAMINED ME SOME TEN MINUTES WITH HER
LARGE HAZEL EYES SHE SUDDENLY COMMENCED CHATTERING FLUENTLY
AH CRIED SHE IN FRENCH YOU SPEAK MY LANGUAGE AS WELL AS MR
ROCHESTER DOES I CAN TALK TO YOU AS I CAN TO HIM AND SO CAN SOPHIE
SHE
WILL BE GLAD NOBODY HERE UNDERSTANDS HER MADAME FAIRFAX IS ALL ENGLISH
SOPHIE IS MY NURSE SHE CAME WITH ME OVER THE SEA IN A GREAT SHIP WITH A
CHIMNEY THAT SMOKED HOW IT DID SMOKE AND I WAS SICK AND SO WAS
SOPHIE AND SO WAS MR
ROCHESTER
MR
ROCHESTER LAY DOWN ON A SOFA IN A
PRETTY ROOM CALLED THE SALON AND SOPHIE AND I HAD LITTLE BEDS IN ANOTHER
PLACE
I NEARLY FELL OUT OF MINE IT WAS LIKE A SHELF
AND
MADEMOISELLE WHAT IS YOUR NAME
EYRE JANE EYRE
AIRE BAH I CANNOT SAY IT
WELL OUR SHIP STOPPED IN THE MORNING
BEFORE IT WAS QUITE DAYLIGHT AT A GREAT CITY A HUGE CITY WITH VERY
DARK HOUSES AND ALL SMOKY NOT AT ALL LIKE THE PRETTY CLEAN TOWN I CAME
FROM AND MR
ROCHESTER CARRIED ME IN HIS ARMS OVER A PLANK TO THE LAND
AND SOPHIE CAME AFTER AND WE ALL GOT INTO A COACH WHICH TOOK US TO A
BEAUTIFUL LARGE HOUSE LARGER THAN THIS AND FINER CALLED AN HOTEL
WE
STAYED THERE NEARLY A WEEK I AND SOPHIE USED TO WALK EVERY DAY IN A
GREAT GREEN PLACE FULL OF TREES CALLED THE PARK AND THERE WERE MANY
CHILDREN THERE BESIDES ME AND A POND WITH BEAUTIFUL BIRDS IN IT THAT I
FED WITH CRUMBS
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND HER WHEN SHE RUNS ON SO FAST ASKED MRS
FAIRFAX
I UNDERSTOOD HER VERY WELL FOR I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THE FLUENT
TONGUE OF MADAME PIERROT
I WISH CONTINUED THE GOOD LADY YOU WOULD ASK HER A QUESTION OR TWO
ABOUT HER PARENTS I WONDER IF SHE REMEMBERS THEM
ADELE I INQUIRED WITH WHOM DID YOU LIVE WHEN YOU WERE IN THAT PRETTY
CLEAN TOWN YOU SPOKE OF
I LIVED LONG AGO WITH MAMA BUT SHE IS GONE TO THE HOLY VIRGIN
MAMA
USED TO TEACH ME TO DANCE AND SING AND TO SAY VERSES
A GREAT MANY
GENTLEMEN AND LADIES CAME TO SEE MAMA AND I USED TO DANCE BEFORE THEM
OR TO SIT ON THEIR KNEES AND SING TO THEM I LIKED IT
SHALL I LET YOU
HEAR ME SING NOW
SHE HAD FINISHED HER BREAKFAST SO I PERMITTED HER TO GIVE A SPECIMEN OF
HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS
DESCENDING FROM HER CHAIR SHE CAME AND PLACED
HERSELF ON MY KNEE THEN FOLDING HER LITTLE HANDS DEMURELY BEFORE HER
SHAKING BACK HER CURLS AND LIFTING HER EYES TO THE CEILING SHE COMMENCED
SINGING A SONG FROM SOME OPERA
IT WAS THE STRAIN OF A FORSAKEN LADY
WHO AFTER BEWAILING THE PERFIDY OF HER LOVER CALLS PRIDE TO HER AID
DESIRES HER ATTENDANT TO DECK HER IN HER BRIGHTEST JEWELS AND RICHEST
ROBES AND RESOLVES TO MEET THE FALSE ONE THAT NIGHT AT A BALL AND PROVE
TO HIM BY THE GAIETY OF HER DEMEANOUR HOW LITTLE HIS DESERTION HAS
AFFECTED HER
THE SUBJECT SEEMED STRANGELY CHOSEN FOR AN INFANT SINGER BUT I SUPPOSE
THE POINT OF THE EXHIBITION LAY IN HEARING THE NOTES OF LOVE AND JEALOUSY
WARBLED WITH THE LISP OF CHILDHOOD AND IN VERY BAD TASTE THAT POINT WAS
AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO
ADELE SANG THE CANZONETTE TUNEFULLY ENOUGH AND WITH THE NAIVETE OF HER
AGE
THIS ACHIEVED SHE JUMPED FROM MY KNEE AND SAID NOW
MADEMOISELLE I WILL REPEAT YOU SOME POETRY
ASSUMING AN ATTITUDE SHE BEGAN LA LIGUE DES RATS FABLE DE LA
FONTAINE SHE THEN DECLAIMED THE LITTLE PIECE WITH AN ATTENTION TO
PUNCTUATION AND EMPHASIS A FLEXIBILITY OF VOICE AND AN APPROPRIATENESS
OF GESTURE VERY UNUSUAL INDEED AT HER AGE AND WHICH PROVED SHE HAD BEEN
CAREFULLY TRAINED
WAS IT YOUR MAMA WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT PIECE I ASKED
YES AND SHE JUST USED TO SAY IT IN THIS WAY 'QU' AVEZ VOUS DONC LUI
DIT UN DE CES RATS PARLEZ SHE MADE ME LIFT MY HAND SO TO REMIND ME
TO RAISE MY VOICE AT THE QUESTION
NOW SHALL I DANCE FOR YOU
NO THAT WILL DO BUT AFTER YOUR MAMA WENT TO THE HOLY VIRGIN AS YOU
SAY WITH WHOM DID YOU LIVE THEN
WITH MADAME FREDERIC AND HER HUSBAND SHE TOOK CARE OF ME BUT SHE IS
NOTHING RELATED TO ME
I THINK SHE IS POOR FOR SHE HAD NOT SO FINE A
HOUSE AS MAMA
I WAS NOT LONG THERE
MR
ROCHESTER ASKED ME IF I WOULD
LIKE TO GO AND LIVE WITH HIM IN ENGLAND AND I SAID YES FOR I KNEW MR
ROCHESTER BEFORE I KNEW MADAME FREDERIC AND HE WAS ALWAYS KIND TO ME AND
GAVE ME PRETTY DRESSES AND TOYS BUT YOU SEE HE HAS NOT KEPT HIS WORD
FOR HE HAS BROUGHT ME TO ENGLAND AND NOW HE IS GONE BACK AGAIN HIMSELF
AND I NEVER SEE HIM
AFTER BREAKFAST ADELE AND I WITHDREW TO THE LIBRARY WHICH ROOM IT
APPEARS MR
ROCHESTER HAD DIRECTED SHOULD BE USED AS THE SCHOOLROOM
MOST OF THE BOOKS WERE LOCKED UP BEHIND GLASS DOORS BUT THERE WAS ONE
BOOKCASE LEFT OPEN CONTAINING EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE NEEDED IN THE WAY
OF ELEMENTARY WORKS AND SEVERAL VOLUMES OF LIGHT LITERATURE POETRY
BIOGRAPHY TRAVELS A FEW ROMANCES C
I SUPPOSE HE HAD CONSIDERED THAT
THESE WERE ALL THE GOVERNESS WOULD REQUIRE FOR HER PRIVATE PERUSAL AND
INDEED THEY CONTENTED ME AMPLY FOR THE PRESENT COMPARED WITH THE SCANTY
PICKINGS I HAD NOW AND THEN BEEN ABLE TO GLEAN AT LOWOOD THEY SEEMED TO
OFFER AN ABUNDANT HARVEST OF ENTERTAINMENT AND INFORMATION
IN THIS
ROOM TOO THERE WAS A CABINET PIANO QUITE NEW AND OF SUPERIOR TONE
ALSO AN EASEL FOR PAINTING AND A PAIR OF GLOBES
I FOUND MY PUPIL SUFFICIENTLY DOCILE THOUGH DISINCLINED TO APPLY SHE
HAD NOT BEEN USED TO REGULAR OCCUPATION OF ANY KIND
I FELT IT WOULD BE
INJUDICIOUS TO CONFINE HER TOO MUCH AT FIRST SO WHEN I HAD TALKED TO
HER A GREAT DEAL AND GOT HER TO LEARN A LITTLE AND WHEN THE MORNING HAD
ADVANCED TO NOON I ALLOWED HER TO RETURN TO HER NURSE
I THEN PROPOSED
TO OCCUPY MYSELF TILL DINNER TIME IN DRAWING SOME LITTLE SKETCHES FOR HER
USE
AS I WAS GOING UPSTAIRS TO FETCH MY PORTFOLIO AND PENCILS MRS
FAIRFAX
CALLED TO ME YOUR MORNING SCHOOL HOURS ARE OVER NOW I SUPPOSE SAID
SHE
SHE WAS IN A ROOM THE FOLDING DOORS OF WHICH STOOD OPEN I WENT IN
WHEN SHE ADDRESSED ME
IT WAS A LARGE STATELY APARTMENT WITH PURPLE
CHAIRS AND CURTAINS A TURKEY CARPET WALNUT PANELLED WALLS ONE VAST
WINDOW RICH IN SLANTED GLASS AND A LOFTY CEILING NOBLY MOULDED
MRS
FAIRFAX WAS DUSTING SOME VASES OF FINE PURPLE SPAR WHICH STOOD ON A
SIDEBOARD
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ROOM I EXCLAIMED AS I LOOKED ROUND FOR I HAD NEVER
BEFORE SEEN ANY HALF SO IMPOSING
YES THIS IS THE DINING ROOM
I HAVE JUST OPENED THE WINDOW TO LET IN
A LITTLE AIR AND SUNSHINE FOR EVERYTHING GETS SO DAMP IN APARTMENTS THAT
ARE SELDOM INHABITED THE DRAWING ROOM YONDER FEELS LIKE A VAULT
SHE POINTED TO A WIDE ARCH CORRESPONDING TO THE WINDOW AND HUNG LIKE IT
WITH A TYRIAN DYED CURTAIN NOW LOOPED UP
MOUNTING TO IT BY TWO BROAD
STEPS AND LOOKING THROUGH I THOUGHT I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A FAIRY
PLACE SO BRIGHT TO MY NOVICE EYES APPEARED THE VIEW BEYOND
YET IT WAS
MERELY A VERY PRETTY DRAWING ROOM AND WITHIN IT A BOUDOIR BOTH SPREAD
WITH WHITE CARPETS ON WHICH SEEMED LAID BRILLIANT GARLANDS OF FLOWERS
BOTH CEILED WITH SNOWY MOULDINGS OF WHITE GRAPES AND VINE LEAVES BENEATH
WHICH GLOWED IN RICH CONTRAST CRIMSON COUCHES AND OTTOMANS WHILE THE
ORNAMENTS ON THE PALE PARIAN MANTELPIECE WERE OF SPARKLING BOHEMIAN
GLASS RUBY RED AND BETWEEN THE WINDOWS LARGE MIRRORS REPEATED THE
GENERAL BLENDING OF SNOW AND FIRE
IN WHAT ORDER YOU KEEP THESE ROOMS MRS
FAIRFAX SAID I
NO DUST NO
CANVAS COVERINGS EXCEPT THAT THE AIR FEELS CHILLY ONE WOULD THINK THEY
WERE INHABITED DAILY
WHY MISS EYRE THOUGH MR
ROCHESTER'S VISITS HERE ARE RARE THEY ARE
ALWAYS SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED AND AS I OBSERVED THAT IT PUT HIM OUT TO
FIND EVERYTHING SWATHED UP AND TO HAVE A BUSTLE OF ARRANGEMENT ON HIS
ARRIVAL I THOUGHT IT BEST TO KEEP THE ROOMS IN READINESS
IS MR
ROCHESTER AN EXACTING FASTIDIOUS SORT OF MAN
NOT PARTICULARLY SO BUT HE HAS A GENTLEMAN'S TASTES AND HABITS AND HE
EXPECTS TO HAVE THINGS MANAGED IN CONFORMITY TO THEM
DO YOU LIKE HIM IS HE GENERALLY LIKED
OH YES THE FAMILY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RESPECTED HERE
ALMOST ALL THE
LAND IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE HAS BELONGED TO THE
ROCHESTERS TIME OUT OF MIND
WELL BUT LEAVING HIS LAND OUT OF THE QUESTION DO YOU LIKE HIM IS HE
LIKED FOR HIMSELF
I HAVE NO CAUSE TO DO OTHERWISE THAN LIKE HIM AND I BELIEVE HE IS
CONSIDERED A JUST AND LIBERAL LANDLORD BY HIS TENANTS BUT HE HAS NEVER
LIVED MUCH AMONGST THEM
BUT HAS HE NO PECULIARITIES WHAT IN SHORT IS HIS CHARACTER
OH HIS CHARACTER IS UNIMPEACHABLE I SUPPOSE
HE IS RATHER PECULIAR
PERHAPS HE HAS TRAVELLED A GREAT DEAL AND SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF THE
WORLD I SHOULD THINK
I DARE SAY HE IS CLEVER BUT I NEVER HAD MUCH
CONVERSATION WITH HIM
IN WHAT WAY IS HE PECULIAR
I DON'T KNOW IT IS NOT EASY TO DESCRIBE NOTHING STRIKING BUT YOU FEEL
IT WHEN HE SPEAKS TO YOU YOU CANNOT BE ALWAYS SURE WHETHER HE IS IN JEST
OR EARNEST WHETHER HE IS PLEASED OR THE CONTRARY YOU DON'T THOROUGHLY
UNDERSTAND HIM IN SHORT AT LEAST I DON'T BUT IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE
HE IS A VERY GOOD MASTER
THIS WAS ALL THE ACCOUNT I GOT FROM MRS
FAIRFAX OF HER EMPLOYER AND
MINE
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO HAVE NO NOTION OF SKETCHING A
CHARACTER OR OBSERVING AND DESCRIBING SALIENT POINTS EITHER IN PERSONS
OR THINGS THE GOOD LADY EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THIS CLASS MY QUERIES
PUZZLED BUT DID NOT DRAW HER OUT
MR
ROCHESTER WAS MR
ROCHESTER IN
HER EYES A GENTLEMAN A LANDED PROPRIETOR NOTHING MORE SHE INQUIRED
AND SEARCHED NO FURTHER AND EVIDENTLY WONDERED AT MY WISH TO GAIN A MORE
DEFINITE NOTION OF HIS IDENTITY
WHEN WE LEFT THE DINING ROOM SHE PROPOSED TO SHOW ME OVER THE REST OF
THE HOUSE AND I FOLLOWED HER UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS ADMIRING AS I
WENT FOR ALL WAS WELL ARRANGED AND HANDSOME
THE LARGE FRONT CHAMBERS I
THOUGHT ESPECIALLY GRAND AND SOME OF THE THIRD STOREY ROOMS THOUGH DARK
AND LOW WERE INTERESTING FROM THEIR AIR OF ANTIQUITY
THE FURNITURE
ONCE APPROPRIATED TO THE LOWER APARTMENTS HAD FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN
REMOVED HERE AS FASHIONS CHANGED AND THE IMPERFECT LIGHT ENTERING BY
THEIR NARROW CASEMENT SHOWED BEDSTEADS OF A HUNDRED YEARS OLD CHESTS IN
OAK OR WALNUT LOOKING WITH THEIR STRANGE CARVINGS OF PALM BRANCHES AND
CHERUBS' HEADS LIKE TYPES OF THE HEBREW ARK ROWS OF VENERABLE CHAIRS
HIGH BACKED AND NARROW STOOLS STILL MORE ANTIQUATED ON WHOSE CUSHIONED
TOPS WERE YET APPARENT TRACES OF HALF EFFACED EMBROIDERIES WROUGHT BY
FINGERS THAT FOR TWO GENERATIONS HAD BEEN COFFIN DUST
ALL THESE RELICS
GAVE TO THE THIRD STOREY OF THORNFIELD HALL THE ASPECT OF A HOME OF THE
PAST A SHRINE OF MEMORY
I LIKED THE HUSH THE GLOOM THE QUAINTNESS OF
THESE RETREATS IN THE DAY BUT I BY NO MEANS COVETED A NIGHT'S REPOSE ON
ONE OF THOSE WIDE AND HEAVY BEDS SHUT IN SOME OF THEM WITH DOORS OF
OAK SHADED OTHERS WITH WROUGHT OLD ENGLISH HANGINGS CRUSTED WITH THICK
WORK PORTRAYING EFFIGIES OF STRANGE FLOWERS AND STRANGER BIRDS AND
STRANGEST HUMAN BEINGS ALL WHICH WOULD HAVE LOOKED STRANGE INDEED BY
THE PALLID GLEAM OF MOONLIGHT
DO THE SERVANTS SLEEP IN THESE ROOMS I ASKED
NO THEY OCCUPY A RANGE OF SMALLER APARTMENTS TO THE BACK NO ONE EVER
SLEEPS HERE ONE WOULD ALMOST SAY THAT IF THERE WERE A GHOST AT
THORNFIELD HALL THIS WOULD BE ITS HAUNT
SO I THINK YOU HAVE NO GHOST THEN
NONE THAT I EVER HEARD OF RETURNED MRS
FAIRFAX SMILING
NOR ANY TRADITIONS OF ONE NO LEGENDS OR GHOST STORIES
I BELIEVE NOT
AND YET IT IS SAID THE ROCHESTERS HAVE BEEN RATHER A
VIOLENT THAN A QUIET RACE IN THEIR TIME PERHAPS THOUGH THAT IS THE
REASON THEY REST TRANQUILLY IN THEIR GRAVES NOW
YES 'AFTER LIFE'S FITFUL FEVER THEY SLEEP WELL I MUTTERED
WHERE
ARE YOU GOING NOW MRS
FAIRFAX FOR SHE WAS MOVING AWAY
ON TO THE LEADS WILL YOU COME AND SEE THE VIEW FROM THENCE I
FOLLOWED STILL UP A VERY NARROW STAIRCASE TO THE ATTICS AND THENCE BY A
LADDER AND THROUGH A TRAP DOOR TO THE ROOF OF THE HALL
I WAS NOW ON A
LEVEL WITH THE CROW COLONY AND COULD SEE INTO THEIR NESTS
LEANING OVER
THE BATTLEMENTS AND LOOKING FAR DOWN I SURVEYED THE GROUNDS LAID OUT
LIKE A MAP THE BRIGHT AND VELVET LAWN CLOSELY GIRDLING THE GREY BASE OF
THE MANSION THE FIELD WIDE AS A PARK DOTTED WITH ITS ANCIENT TIMBER
THE WOOD DUN AND SERE DIVIDED BY A PATH VISIBLY OVERGROWN GREENER WITH
MOSS THAN THE TREES WERE WITH FOLIAGE THE CHURCH AT THE GATES THE ROAD
THE TRANQUIL HILLS ALL REPOSING IN THE AUTUMN DAY'S SUN THE HORIZON
BOUNDED BY A PROPITIOUS SKY AZURE MARBLED WITH PEARLY WHITE
NO
FEATURE IN THE SCENE WAS EXTRAORDINARY BUT ALL WAS PLEASING
WHEN I
TURNED FROM IT AND REPASSED THE TRAP DOOR I COULD SCARCELY SEE MY WAY
DOWN THE LADDER THE ATTIC SEEMED BLACK AS A VAULT COMPARED WITH THAT
ARCH OF BLUE AIR TO WHICH I HAD BEEN LOOKING UP AND TO THAT SUNLIT SCENE
OF GROVE PASTURE AND GREEN HILL OF WHICH THE HALL WAS THE CENTRE AND
OVER WHICH I HAD BEEN GAZING WITH DELIGHT
MRS
FAIRFAX STAYED BEHIND A MOMENT TO FASTEN THE TRAP DOOR I BY DRIFT
OF GROPING FOUND THE OUTLET FROM THE ATTIC AND PROCEEDED TO DESCEND THE
NARROW GARRET STAIRCASE
I LINGERED IN THE LONG PASSAGE TO WHICH THIS
LED SEPARATING THE FRONT AND BACK ROOMS OF THE THIRD STOREY NARROW
LOW AND DIM WITH ONLY ONE LITTLE WINDOW AT THE FAR END AND LOOKING
WITH ITS TWO ROWS OF SMALL BLACK DOORS ALL SHUT LIKE A CORRIDOR IN SOME
BLUEBEARD'S CASTLE
WHILE I PACED SOFTLY ON THE LAST SOUND I EXPECTED TO HEAR IN SO STILL A
REGION A LAUGH STRUCK MY EAR
IT WAS A CURIOUS LAUGH DISTINCT
FORMAL MIRTHLESS
I STOPPED THE SOUND CEASED ONLY FOR AN INSTANT IT
BEGAN AGAIN LOUDER FOR AT FIRST THOUGH DISTINCT IT WAS VERY LOW
IT
PASSED OFF IN A CLAMOROUS PEAL THAT SEEMED TO WAKE AN ECHO IN EVERY
LONELY CHAMBER THOUGH IT ORIGINATED BUT IN ONE AND I COULD HAVE POINTED
OUT THE DOOR WHENCE THE ACCENTS ISSUED
MRS
FAIRFAX I CALLED OUT FOR I NOW HEARD HER DESCENDING THE GREAT
STAIRS
DID YOU HEAR THAT LOUD LAUGH WHO IS IT
SOME OF THE SERVANTS VERY LIKELY SHE ANSWERED PERHAPS GRACE POOLE
DID YOU HEAR IT I AGAIN INQUIRED
YES PLAINLY I OFTEN HEAR HER SHE SEWS IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS
SOMETIMES LEAH IS WITH HER THEY ARE FREQUENTLY NOISY TOGETHER
THE LAUGH WAS REPEATED IN ITS LOW SYLLABIC TONE AND TERMINATED IN AN
ODD MURMUR
GRACE EXCLAIMED MRS
FAIRFAX
I REALLY DID NOT EXPECT ANY GRACE TO ANSWER FOR THE LAUGH WAS AS TRAGIC
AS PRETERNATURAL A LAUGH AS ANY I EVER HEARD AND BUT THAT IT WAS HIGH
NOON AND THAT NO CIRCUMSTANCE OF GHOSTLINESS ACCOMPANIED THE CURIOUS
CACHINNATION BUT THAT NEITHER SCENE NOR SEASON FAVOURED FEAR I SHOULD
HAVE BEEN SUPERSTITIOUSLY AFRAID
HOWEVER THE EVENT SHOWED ME I WAS A
FOOL FOR ENTERTAINING A SENSE EVEN OF SURPRISE
THE DOOR NEAREST ME OPENED AND A SERVANT CAME OUT A WOMAN OF BETWEEN
THIRTY AND FORTY A SET SQUARE MADE FIGURE RED HAIRED AND WITH A HARD
PLAIN FACE ANY APPARITION LESS ROMANTIC OR LESS GHOSTLY COULD SCARCELY
BE CONCEIVED
TOO MUCH NOISE GRACE SAID MRS
FAIRFAX
REMEMBER DIRECTIONS GRACE
CURTSEYED SILENTLY AND WENT IN
SHE IS A PERSON WE HAVE TO SEW AND ASSIST LEAH IN HER HOUSEMAID'S WORK
CONTINUED THE WIDOW NOT ALTOGETHER UNOBJECTIONABLE IN SOME POINTS BUT
SHE DOES WELL ENOUGH
BY THE BYE HOW HAVE YOU GOT ON WITH YOUR NEW
PUPIL THIS MORNING
THE CONVERSATION THUS TURNED ON ADELE CONTINUED TILL WE REACHED THE
LIGHT AND CHEERFUL REGION BELOW
ADELE CAME RUNNING TO MEET US IN THE
HALL EXCLAIMING
MESDAMES VOUS ETES SERVIES ADDING J'AI BIEN FAIM MOI
WE FOUND DINNER READY AND WAITING FOR US IN MRS
FAIRFAX'S ROOM
CHAPTER XII
THE PROMISE OF A SMOOTH CAREER WHICH MY FIRST CALM INTRODUCTION TO
THORNFIELD HALL SEEMED TO PLEDGE WAS NOT BELIED ON A LONGER ACQUAINTANCE
WITH THE PLACE AND ITS INMATES
MRS
FAIRFAX TURNED OUT TO BE WHAT SHE
APPEARED A PLACID TEMPERED KIND NATURED WOMAN OF COMPETENT EDUCATION
AND AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE
MY PUPIL WAS A LIVELY CHILD WHO HAD BEEN
SPOILT AND INDULGED AND THEREFORE WAS SOMETIMES WAYWARD BUT AS SHE WAS
COMMITTED ENTIRELY TO MY CARE AND NO INJUDICIOUS INTERFERENCE FROM ANY
QUARTER EVER THWARTED MY PLANS FOR HER IMPROVEMENT SHE SOON FORGOT HER
LITTLE FREAKS AND BECAME OBEDIENT AND TEACHABLE
SHE HAD NO GREAT
TALENTS NO MARKED TRAITS OF CHARACTER NO PECULIAR DEVELOPMENT OF
FEELING OR TASTE WHICH RAISED HER ONE INCH ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL OF
CHILDHOOD BUT NEITHER HAD SHE ANY DEFICIENCY OR VICE WHICH SUNK HER
BELOW IT
SHE MADE REASONABLE PROGRESS ENTERTAINED FOR ME A VIVACIOUS
THOUGH PERHAPS NOT VERY PROFOUND AFFECTION AND BY HER SIMPLICITY GAY
PRATTLE AND EFFORTS TO PLEASE INSPIRED ME IN RETURN WITH A DEGREE OF
ATTACHMENT SUFFICIENT TO MAKE US BOTH CONTENT IN EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY
THIS PAR PARENTHESE WILL BE THOUGHT COOL LANGUAGE BY PERSONS WHO
ENTERTAIN SOLEMN DOCTRINES ABOUT THE ANGELIC NATURE OF CHILDREN AND THE
DUTY OF THOSE CHARGED WITH THEIR EDUCATION TO CONCEIVE FOR THEM AN
IDOLATROUS DEVOTION BUT I AM NOT WRITING TO FLATTER PARENTAL EGOTISM TO
ECHO CANT OR PROP UP HUMBUG I AM MERELY TELLING THE TRUTH
I FELT A
CONSCIENTIOUS SOLICITUDE FOR ADELE'S WELFARE AND PROGRESS AND A QUIET
LIKING FOR HER LITTLE SELF JUST AS I CHERISHED TOWARDS MRS
FAIRFAX A
THANKFULNESS FOR HER KINDNESS AND A PLEASURE IN HER SOCIETY
PROPORTIONATE TO THE TRANQUIL REGARD SHE HAD FOR ME AND THE MODERATION
OF HER MIND AND CHARACTER
ANYBODY MAY BLAME ME WHO LIKES WHEN I ADD FURTHER THAT NOW AND THEN
WHEN I TOOK A WALK BY MYSELF IN THE GROUNDS WHEN I WENT DOWN TO THE
GATES AND LOOKED THROUGH THEM ALONG THE ROAD OR WHEN WHILE ADELE PLAYED
WITH HER NURSE AND MRS
FAIRFAX MADE JELLIES IN THE STOREROOM I CLIMBED
THE THREE STAIRCASES RAISED THE TRAP DOOR OF THE ATTIC AND HAVING
REACHED THE LEADS LOOKED OUT AFAR OVER SEQUESTERED FIELD AND HILL AND
ALONG DIM SKY LINE THAT THEN I LONGED FOR A POWER OF VISION WHICH MIGHT
OVERPASS THAT LIMIT WHICH MIGHT REACH THE BUSY WORLD TOWNS REGIONS
FULL OF LIFE I HAD HEARD OF BUT NEVER SEEN THAT THEN I DESIRED MORE OF
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE THAN I POSSESSED MORE OF INTERCOURSE WITH MY KIND
OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH VARIETY OF CHARACTER THAN WAS HERE WITHIN MY REACH
I VALUED WHAT WAS GOOD IN MRS
FAIRFAX AND WHAT WAS GOOD IN ADELE BUT I
BELIEVED IN THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER AND MORE VIVID KINDS OF GOODNESS AND
WHAT I BELIEVED IN I WISHED TO BEHOLD
WHO BLAMES ME MANY NO DOUBT AND I SHALL BE CALLED DISCONTENTED
I
COULD NOT HELP IT THE RESTLESSNESS WAS IN MY NATURE IT AGITATED ME TO
PAIN SOMETIMES
THEN MY SOLE RELIEF WAS TO WALK ALONG THE CORRIDOR OF
THE THIRD STOREY BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS SAFE IN THE SILENCE AND
SOLITUDE OF THE SPOT AND ALLOW MY MIND'S EYE TO DWELL ON WHATEVER BRIGHT
VISIONS ROSE BEFORE IT AND CERTAINLY THEY WERE MANY AND GLOWING TO
LET MY HEART BE HEAVED BY THE EXULTANT MOVEMENT WHICH WHILE IT SWELLED
IT IN TROUBLE EXPANDED IT WITH LIFE AND BEST OF ALL TO OPEN MY INWARD
EAR TO A TALE THAT WAS NEVER ENDED A TALE MY IMAGINATION CREATED AND
NARRATED CONTINUOUSLY QUICKENED WITH ALL OF INCIDENT LIFE FIRE
FEELING THAT I DESIRED AND HAD NOT IN MY ACTUAL EXISTENCE
IT IS IN VAIN TO SAY HUMAN BEINGS OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED WITH
TRANQUILLITY THEY MUST HAVE ACTION AND THEY WILL MAKE IT IF THEY CANNOT
FIND IT
MILLIONS ARE CONDEMNED TO A STILLER DOOM THAN MINE AND
MILLIONS ARE IN SILENT REVOLT AGAINST THEIR LOT
NOBODY KNOWS HOW MANY
REBELLIONS BESIDES POLITICAL REBELLIONS FERMENT IN THE MASSES OF LIFE
WHICH PEOPLE EARTH
WOMEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY CALM GENERALLY BUT
WOMEN FEEL JUST AS MEN FEEL THEY NEED EXERCISE FOR THEIR FACULTIES AND
A FIELD FOR THEIR EFFORTS AS MUCH AS THEIR BROTHERS DO THEY SUFFER FROM
TOO RIGID A RESTRAINT TOO ABSOLUTE A STAGNATION PRECISELY AS MEN WOULD
SUFFER AND IT IS NARROW MINDED IN THEIR MORE PRIVILEGED FELLOW CREATURES
TO SAY THAT THEY OUGHT TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO MAKING PUDDINGS AND
KNITTING STOCKINGS TO PLAYING ON THE PIANO AND EMBROIDERING BAGS
IT IS
THOUGHTLESS TO CONDEMN THEM OR LAUGH AT THEM IF THEY SEEK TO DO MORE OR
LEARN MORE THAN CUSTOM HAS PRONOUNCED NECESSARY FOR THEIR SEX
WHEN THUS ALONE I NOT UNFREQUENTLY HEARD GRACE POOLE'S LAUGH THE SAME
PEAL THE SAME LOW SLOW HA HA WHICH WHEN FIRST HEARD HAD THRILLED
ME I HEARD TOO HER ECCENTRIC MURMURS STRANGER THAN HER LAUGH
THERE
WERE DAYS WHEN SHE WAS QUITE SILENT BUT THERE WERE OTHERS WHEN I COULD
NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE SOUNDS SHE MADE
SOMETIMES I SAW HER SHE WOULD COME
OUT OF HER ROOM WITH A BASIN OR A PLATE OR A TRAY IN HER HAND GO DOWN
TO THE KITCHEN AND SHORTLY RETURN GENERALLY OH ROMANTIC READER
FORGIVE ME FOR TELLING THE PLAIN TRUTH BEARING A POT OF PORTER
HER
APPEARANCE ALWAYS ACTED AS A DAMPER TO THE CURIOSITY RAISED BY HER ORAL
ODDITIES HARD FEATURED AND STAID SHE HAD NO POINT TO WHICH INTEREST
COULD ATTACH
I MADE SOME ATTEMPTS TO DRAW HER INTO CONVERSATION BUT
SHE SEEMED A PERSON OF FEW WORDS A MONOSYLLABIC REPLY USUALLY CUT SHORT
EVERY EFFORT OF THAT SORT
THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD VIZ JOHN AND HIS WIFE LEAH THE
HOUSEMAID AND SOPHIE THE FRENCH NURSE WERE DECENT PEOPLE BUT IN NO
RESPECT REMARKABLE WITH SOPHIE I USED TO TALK FRENCH AND SOMETIMES I
ASKED HER QUESTIONS ABOUT HER NATIVE COUNTRY BUT SHE WAS NOT OF A
DESCRIPTIVE OR NARRATIVE TURN AND GENERALLY GAVE SUCH VAPID AND CONFUSED
ANSWERS AS WERE CALCULATED RATHER TO CHECK THAN ENCOURAGE INQUIRY
OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER PASSED AWAY
ONE AFTERNOON IN JANUARY MRS
FAIRFAX HAD BEGGED A HOLIDAY FOR ADELE BECAUSE SHE HAD A COLD AND AS
ADELE SECONDED THE REQUEST WITH AN ARDOUR THAT REMINDED ME HOW PRECIOUS
OCCASIONAL HOLIDAYS HAD BEEN TO ME IN MY OWN CHILDHOOD I ACCORDED IT
DEEMING THAT I DID WELL IN SHOWING PLIABILITY ON THE POINT
IT WAS A
FINE CALM DAY THOUGH VERY COLD I WAS TIRED OF SITTING STILL IN THE
LIBRARY THROUGH A WHOLE LONG MORNING MRS
FAIRFAX HAD JUST WRITTEN A
LETTER WHICH WAS WAITING TO BE POSTED SO I PUT ON MY BONNET AND CLOAK
AND VOLUNTEERED TO CARRY IT TO HAY THE DISTANCE TWO MILES WOULD BE A
PLEASANT WINTER AFTERNOON WALK
HAVING SEEN ADELE COMFORTABLY SEATED IN
HER LITTLE CHAIR BY MRS
FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR FIRESIDE AND GIVEN HER HER
BEST WAX DOLL WHICH I USUALLY KEPT ENVELOPED IN SILVER PAPER IN A
DRAWER TO PLAY WITH AND A STORY BOOK FOR CHANGE OF AMUSEMENT AND
HAVING REPLIED TO HER REVENEZ BIENTOT MA BONNE AMIE MA CHERE MDLLE
JEANNETTE WITH A KISS I SET OUT
THE GROUND WAS HARD THE AIR WAS STILL MY ROAD WAS LONELY I WALKED FAST
TILL I GOT WARM AND THEN I WALKED SLOWLY TO ENJOY AND ANALYSE THE
SPECIES OF PLEASURE BROODING FOR ME IN THE HOUR AND SITUATION
IT WAS
THREE O'CLOCK THE CHURCH BELL TOLLED AS I PASSED UNDER THE BELFRY THE
CHARM OF THE HOUR LAY IN ITS APPROACHING DIMNESS IN THE LOW GLIDING AND
PALE BEAMING SUN
I WAS A MILE FROM THORNFIELD IN A LANE NOTED FOR WILD
ROSES IN SUMMER FOR NUTS AND BLACKBERRIES IN AUTUMN AND EVEN NOW
POSSESSING A FEW CORAL TREASURES IN HIPS AND HAWS BUT WHOSE BEST WINTER
DELIGHT LAY IN ITS UTTER SOLITUDE AND LEAFLESS REPOSE
IF A BREATH OF
AIR STIRRED IT MADE NO SOUND HERE FOR THERE WAS NOT A HOLLY NOT AN
EVERGREEN TO RUSTLE AND THE STRIPPED HAWTHORN AND HAZEL BUSHES WERE AS
STILL AS THE WHITE WORN STONES WHICH CAUSEWAYED THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH
FAR AND WIDE ON EACH SIDE THERE WERE ONLY FIELDS WHERE NO CATTLE NOW
BROWSED AND THE LITTLE BROWN BIRDS WHICH STIRRED OCCASIONALLY IN THE
HEDGE LOOKED LIKE SINGLE RUSSET LEAVES THAT HAD FORGOTTEN TO DROP
THIS LANE INCLINED UP HILL ALL THE WAY TO HAY HAVING REACHED THE MIDDLE
I SAT DOWN ON A STILE WHICH LED THENCE INTO A FIELD
GATHERING MY MANTLE
ABOUT ME AND SHELTERING MY HANDS IN MY MUFF I DID NOT FEEL THE COLD
THOUGH IT FROZE KEENLY AS WAS ATTESTED BY A SHEET OF ICE COVERING THE
CAUSEWAY WHERE A LITTLE BROOKLET NOW CONGEALED HAD OVERFLOWED AFTER A
RAPID THAW SOME DAYS SINCE
FROM MY SEAT I COULD LOOK DOWN ON
THORNFIELD THE GREY AND BATTLEMENTED HALL WAS THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT IN
THE VALE BELOW ME ITS WOODS AND DARK ROOKERY ROSE AGAINST THE WEST
I
LINGERED TILL THE SUN WENT DOWN AMONGST THE TREES AND SANK CRIMSON AND
CLEAR BEHIND THEM
I THEN TURNED EASTWARD
ON THE HILL TOP ABOVE ME SAT THE RISING MOON PALE YET AS A CLOUD BUT
BRIGHTENING MOMENTARILY SHE LOOKED OVER HAY WHICH HALF LOST IN TREES
SENT UP A BLUE SMOKE FROM ITS FEW CHIMNEYS IT WAS YET A MILE DISTANT
BUT IN THE ABSOLUTE HUSH I COULD HEAR PLAINLY ITS THIN MURMURS OF LIFE
MY EAR TOO FELT THE FLOW OF CURRENTS IN WHAT DALES AND DEPTHS I COULD
NOT TELL BUT THERE WERE MANY HILLS BEYOND HAY AND DOUBTLESS MANY BECKS
THREADING THEIR PASSES
THAT EVENING CALM BETRAYED ALIKE THE TINKLE OF
THE NEAREST STREAMS THE SOUGH OF THE MOST REMOTE
A RUDE NOISE BROKE ON THESE FINE RIPPLINGS AND WHISPERINGS AT ONCE SO
FAR AWAY AND SO CLEAR A POSITIVE TRAMP TRAMP A METALLIC CLATTER WHICH
EFFACED THE SOFT WAVE WANDERINGS AS IN A PICTURE THE SOLID MASS OF A
CRAG OR THE ROUGH BOLES OF A GREAT OAK DRAWN IN DARK AND STRONG ON THE
FOREGROUND EFFACE THE AERIAL DISTANCE OF AZURE HILL SUNNY HORIZON AND
BLENDED CLOUDS WHERE TINT MELTS INTO TINT
THE DIN WAS ON THE CAUSEWAY A HORSE WAS COMING THE WINDINGS OF THE LANE
YET HID IT BUT IT APPROACHED
I WAS JUST LEAVING THE STILE YET AS THE
PATH WAS NARROW I SAT STILL TO LET IT GO BY
IN THOSE DAYS I WAS YOUNG
AND ALL SORTS OF FANCIES BRIGHT AND DARK TENANTED MY MIND THE MEMORIES
OF NURSERY STORIES WERE THERE AMONGST OTHER RUBBISH AND WHEN THEY
RECURRED MATURING YOUTH ADDED TO THEM A VIGOUR AND VIVIDNESS BEYOND WHAT
CHILDHOOD COULD GIVE
AS THIS HORSE APPROACHED AND AS I WATCHED FOR IT
TO APPEAR THROUGH THE DUSK I REMEMBERED CERTAIN OF BESSIE'S TALES
WHEREIN FIGURED A NORTH OF ENGLAND SPIRIT CALLED A GYTRASH WHICH IN
THE FORM OF HORSE MULE OR LARGE DOG HAUNTED SOLITARY WAYS AND
SOMETIMES CAME UPON BELATED TRAVELLERS AS THIS HORSE WAS NOW COMING UPON
ME
IT WAS VERY NEAR BUT NOT YET IN SIGHT WHEN IN ADDITION TO THE TRAMP
TRAMP I HEARD A RUSH UNDER THE HEDGE AND CLOSE DOWN BY THE HAZEL STEMS
GLIDED A GREAT DOG WHOSE BLACK AND WHITE COLOUR MADE HIM A DISTINCT
OBJECT AGAINST THE TREES
IT WAS EXACTLY ONE FORM OF BESSIE'S GYTRASH A
LION LIKE CREATURE WITH LONG HAIR AND A HUGE HEAD IT PASSED ME HOWEVER
QUIETLY ENOUGH NOT STAYING TO LOOK UP WITH STRANGE PRETERCANINE EYES
IN MY FACE AS I HALF EXPECTED IT WOULD
THE HORSE FOLLOWED A TALL
STEED AND ON ITS BACK A RIDER
THE MAN THE HUMAN BEING BROKE THE
SPELL AT ONCE
NOTHING EVER RODE THE GYTRASH IT WAS ALWAYS ALONE AND
GOBLINS TO MY NOTIONS THOUGH THEY MIGHT TENANT THE DUMB CARCASSES OF
BEASTS COULD SCARCE COVET SHELTER IN THE COMMONPLACE HUMAN FORM
NO
GYTRASH WAS THIS ONLY A TRAVELLER TAKING THE SHORT CUT TO MILLCOTE
HE
PASSED AND I WENT ON A FEW STEPS AND I TURNED A SLIDING SOUND AND AN
EXCLAMATION OF WHAT THE DEUCE IS TO DO NOW AND A CLATTERING TUMBLE
ARRESTED MY ATTENTION
MAN AND HORSE WERE DOWN THEY HAD SLIPPED ON THE
SHEET OF ICE WHICH GLAZED THE CAUSEWAY
THE DOG CAME BOUNDING BACK AND
SEEING HIS MASTER IN A PREDICAMENT AND HEARING THE HORSE GROAN BARKED
TILL THE EVENING HILLS ECHOED THE SOUND WHICH WAS DEEP IN PROPORTION TO
HIS MAGNITUDE
HE SNUFFED ROUND THE PROSTRATE GROUP AND THEN HE RAN UP
TO ME IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO THERE WAS NO OTHER HELP AT HAND TO
SUMMON
I OBEYED HIM AND WALKED DOWN TO THE TRAVELLER BY THIS TIME
STRUGGLING HIMSELF FREE OF HIS STEED
HIS EFFORTS WERE SO VIGOROUS I
THOUGHT HE COULD NOT BE MUCH HURT BUT I ASKED HIM THE QUESTION
ARE YOU INJURED SIR
I THINK HE WAS SWEARING BUT AM NOT CERTAIN HOWEVER HE WAS PRONOUNCING
SOME FORMULA WHICH PREVENTED HIM FROM REPLYING TO ME DIRECTLY
CAN I DO ANYTHING I ASKED AGAIN
YOU MUST JUST STAND ON ONE SIDE HE ANSWERED AS HE ROSE FIRST TO HIS
KNEES AND THEN TO HIS FEET
I DID WHEREUPON BEGAN A HEAVING STAMPING
CLATTERING PROCESS ACCOMPANIED BY A BARKING AND BAYING WHICH REMOVED ME
EFFECTUALLY SOME YARDS' DISTANCE BUT I WOULD NOT BE DRIVEN QUITE AWAY
TILL I SAW THE EVENT
THIS WAS FINALLY FORTUNATE THE HORSE WAS
RE ESTABLISHED AND THE DOG WAS SILENCED WITH A DOWN PILOT THE
TRAVELLER NOW STOOPING FELT HIS FOOT AND LEG AS IF TRYING WHETHER THEY
WERE SOUND APPARENTLY SOMETHING AILED THEM FOR HE HALTED TO THE STILE
WHENCE I HAD JUST RISEN AND SAT DOWN
I WAS IN THE MOOD FOR BEING USEFUL OR AT LEAST OFFICIOUS I THINK FOR I
NOW DREW NEAR HIM AGAIN
IF YOU ARE HURT AND WANT HELP SIR I CAN FETCH SOME ONE EITHER FROM
THORNFIELD HALL OR FROM HAY
THANK YOU I SHALL DO I HAVE NO BROKEN BONES ONLY A SPRAIN AND
AGAIN HE STOOD UP AND TRIED HIS FOOT BUT THE RESULT EXTORTED AN
INVOLUNTARY UGH
SOMETHING OF DAYLIGHT STILL LINGERED AND THE MOON WAS WAXING BRIGHT I
COULD SEE HIM PLAINLY
HIS FIGURE WAS ENVELOPED IN A RIDING CLOAK FUR
COLLARED AND STEEL CLASPED ITS DETAILS WERE NOT APPARENT BUT I TRACED
THE GENERAL POINTS OF MIDDLE HEIGHT AND CONSIDERABLE BREADTH OF CHEST
HE
HAD A DARK FACE WITH STERN FEATURES AND A HEAVY BROW HIS EYES AND
GATHERED EYEBROWS LOOKED IREFUL AND THWARTED JUST NOW HE WAS PAST YOUTH
BUT HAD NOT REACHED MIDDLE AGE PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE THIRTY FIVE
I FELT
NO FEAR OF HIM AND BUT LITTLE SHYNESS
HAD HE BEEN A HANDSOME HEROIC
LOOKING YOUNG GENTLEMAN I SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO STAND THUS
QUESTIONING HIM AGAINST HIS WILL AND OFFERING MY SERVICES UNASKED
I
HAD HARDLY EVER SEEN A HANDSOME YOUTH NEVER IN MY LIFE SPOKEN TO ONE
I
HAD A THEORETICAL REVERENCE AND HOMAGE FOR BEAUTY ELEGANCE GALLANTRY
FASCINATION BUT HAD I MET THOSE QUALITIES INCARNATE IN MASCULINE SHAPE
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN INSTINCTIVELY THAT THEY NEITHER HAD NOR COULD HAVE
SYMPATHY WITH ANYTHING IN ME AND SHOULD HAVE SHUNNED THEM AS ONE WOULD
FIRE LIGHTNING OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS BRIGHT BUT ANTIPATHETIC
IF EVEN THIS STRANGER HAD SMILED AND BEEN GOOD HUMOURED TO ME WHEN I
ADDRESSED HIM IF HE HAD PUT OFF MY OFFER OF ASSISTANCE GAILY AND WITH
THANKS I SHOULD HAVE GONE ON MY WAY AND NOT FELT ANY VOCATION TO RENEW
INQUIRIES BUT THE FROWN THE ROUGHNESS OF THE TRAVELLER SET ME AT MY
EASE I RETAINED MY STATION WHEN HE WAVED TO ME TO GO AND ANNOUNCED
I CANNOT THINK OF LEAVING YOU SIR AT SO LATE AN HOUR IN THIS SOLITARY
LANE TILL I SEE YOU ARE FIT TO MOUNT YOUR HORSE
HE LOOKED AT ME WHEN I SAID THIS HE HAD HARDLY TURNED HIS EYES IN MY
DIRECTION BEFORE
I SHOULD THINK YOU OUGHT TO BE AT HOME YOURSELF SAID HE IF YOU HAVE
A HOME IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE DO YOU COME FROM
FROM JUST BELOW AND I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF BEING OUT LATE WHEN IT IS
MOONLIGHT I WILL RUN OVER TO HAY FOR YOU WITH PLEASURE IF YOU WISH IT
INDEED I AM GOING THERE TO POST A LETTER
YOU LIVE JUST BELOW DO YOU MEAN AT THAT HOUSE WITH THE BATTLEMENTS
POINTING TO THORNFIELD HALL ON WHICH THE MOON CAST A HOARY GLEAM
BRINGING IT OUT DISTINCT AND PALE FROM THE WOODS THAT BY CONTRAST WITH
THE WESTERN SKY NOW SEEMED ONE MASS OF SHADOW
YES SIR
WHOSE HOUSE IS IT
MR
ROCHESTER'S
DO YOU KNOW MR
ROCHESTER
NO I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM
HE IS NOT RESIDENT THEN
NO
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE HE IS
I CANNOT
YOU ARE NOT A SERVANT AT THE HALL OF COURSE
YOU ARE HE STOPPED
RAN HIS EYE OVER MY DRESS WHICH AS USUAL WAS QUITE SIMPLE A BLACK
MERINO CLOAK A BLACK BEAVER BONNET NEITHER OF THEM HALF FINE ENOUGH FOR
A LADY'S MAID
HE SEEMED PUZZLED TO DECIDE WHAT I WAS I HELPED HIM
I AM THE GOVERNESS
AH THE GOVERNESS HE REPEATED DEUCE TAKE ME IF I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN
THE GOVERNESS AND AGAIN MY RAIMENT UNDERWENT SCRUTINY
IN TWO MINUTES
HE ROSE FROM THE STILE HIS FACE EXPRESSED PAIN WHEN HE TRIED TO MOVE
I CANNOT COMMISSION YOU TO FETCH HELP HE SAID BUT YOU MAY HELP ME A
LITTLE YOURSELF IF YOU WILL BE SO KIND
YES SIR
YOU HAVE NOT AN UMBRELLA THAT I CAN USE AS A STICK
NO
TRY TO GET HOLD OF MY HORSE'S BRIDLE AND LEAD HIM TO ME YOU ARE NOT
AFRAID
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO TOUCH A HORSE WHEN ALONE BUT WHEN TOLD TO
DO IT I WAS DISPOSED TO OBEY
I PUT DOWN MY MUFF ON THE STILE AND WENT
UP TO THE TALL STEED I ENDEAVOURED TO CATCH THE BRIDLE BUT IT WAS A
SPIRITED THING AND WOULD NOT LET ME COME NEAR ITS HEAD I MADE EFFORT ON
EFFORT THOUGH IN VAIN MEANTIME I WAS MORTALLY AFRAID OF ITS TRAMPLING
FORE FEET
THE TRAVELLER WAITED AND WATCHED FOR SOME TIME AND AT LAST
HE LAUGHED
I WAS MORTALLY AFRAID OF ITS TRAMPLING FOREFEET P107 JPG
I SEE HE SAID THE MOUNTAIN WILL NEVER BE BROUGHT TO MAHOMET SO ALL
YOU CAN DO IS TO AID MAHOMET TO GO TO THE MOUNTAIN I MUST BEG OF YOU TO
COME HERE
I CAME
EXCUSE ME HE CONTINUED NECESSITY COMPELS ME TO MAKE YOU
USEFUL HE LAID A HEAVY HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND LEANING ON ME WITH
SOME STRESS LIMPED TO HIS HORSE
HAVING ONCE CAUGHT THE BRIDLE HE
MASTERED IT DIRECTLY AND SPRANG TO HIS SADDLE GRIMACING GRIMLY AS HE
MADE THE EFFORT FOR IT WRENCHED HIS SPRAIN
NOW SAID HE RELEASING HIS UNDER LIP FROM A HARD BITE JUST HAND ME
MY WHIP IT LIES THERE UNDER THE HEDGE
I SOUGHT IT AND FOUND IT
THANK YOU NOW MAKE HASTE WITH THE LETTER TO HAY AND RETURN AS FAST AS
YOU CAN
A TOUCH OF A SPURRED HEEL MADE HIS HORSE FIRST START AND REAR AND THEN
BOUND AWAY THE DOG RUSHED IN HIS TRACES ALL THREE VANISHED
LIKE HEATH THAT IN THE WILDERNESS
THE WILD WIND WHIRLS AWAY
I TOOK UP MY MUFF AND WALKED ON
THE INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED AND WAS GONE
FOR ME IT WAS AN INCIDENT OF NO MOMENT NO ROMANCE NO INTEREST IN A
SENSE YET IT MARKED WITH CHANGE ONE SINGLE HOUR OF A MONOTONOUS LIFE
MY
HELP HAD BEEN NEEDED AND CLAIMED I HAD GIVEN IT I WAS PLEASED TO HAVE
DONE SOMETHING TRIVIAL TRANSITORY THOUGH THE DEED WAS IT WAS YET AN
ACTIVE THING AND I WAS WEARY OF AN EXISTENCE ALL PASSIVE
THE NEW FACE
TOO WAS LIKE A NEW PICTURE INTRODUCED TO THE GALLERY OF MEMORY AND IT
WAS DISSIMILAR TO ALL THE OTHERS HANGING THERE FIRSTLY BECAUSE IT WAS
MASCULINE AND SECONDLY BECAUSE IT WAS DARK STRONG AND STERN
I HAD
IT STILL BEFORE ME WHEN I ENTERED HAY AND SLIPPED THE LETTER INTO THE
POST OFFICE I SAW IT AS I WALKED FAST DOWN HILL ALL THE WAY HOME
WHEN
I CAME TO THE STILE I STOPPED A MINUTE LOOKED ROUND AND LISTENED WITH
AN IDEA THAT A HORSE'S HOOFS MIGHT RING ON THE CAUSEWAY AGAIN AND THAT A
RIDER IN A CLOAK AND A GYTRASH LIKE NEWFOUNDLAND DOG MIGHT BE AGAIN
APPARENT I SAW ONLY THE HEDGE AND A POLLARD WILLOW BEFORE ME RISING UP
STILL AND STRAIGHT TO MEET THE MOONBEAMS I HEARD ONLY THE FAINTEST WAFT
OF WIND ROAMING FITFUL AMONG THE TREES ROUND THORNFIELD A MILE DISTANT
AND WHEN I GLANCED DOWN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MURMUR MY EYE
TRAVERSING THE HALL FRONT CAUGHT A LIGHT KINDLING IN A WINDOW IT
REMINDED ME THAT I WAS LATE AND I HURRIED ON
I DID NOT LIKE RE ENTERING THORNFIELD
TO PASS ITS THRESHOLD WAS TO
RETURN TO STAGNATION TO CROSS THE SILENT HALL TO ASCEND THE DARKSOME
STAIRCASE TO SEEK MY OWN LONELY LITTLE ROOM AND THEN TO MEET TRANQUIL
MRS
FAIRFAX AND SPEND THE LONG WINTER EVENING WITH HER AND HER ONLY
WAS TO QUELL WHOLLY THE FAINT EXCITEMENT WAKENED BY MY WALK TO SLIP
AGAIN OVER MY FACULTIES THE VIEWLESS FETTERS OF AN UNIFORM AND TOO STILL
EXISTENCE OF AN EXISTENCE WHOSE VERY PRIVILEGES OF SECURITY AND EASE I
WAS BECOMING INCAPABLE OF APPRECIATING
WHAT GOOD IT WOULD HAVE DONE ME
AT THAT TIME TO HAVE BEEN TOSSED IN THE STORMS OF AN UNCERTAIN STRUGGLING
LIFE AND TO HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BY ROUGH AND BITTER EXPERIENCE TO LONG FOR
THE CALM AMIDST WHICH I NOW REPINED YES JUST AS MUCH GOOD AS IT WOULD
DO A MAN TIRED OF SITTING STILL IN A TOO EASY CHAIR TO TAKE A LONG
WALK AND JUST AS NATURAL WAS THE WISH TO STIR UNDER MY CIRCUMSTANCES
AS IT WOULD BE UNDER HIS
I LINGERED AT THE GATES I LINGERED ON THE LAWN I PACED BACKWARDS AND
FORWARDS ON THE PAVEMENT THE SHUTTERS OF THE GLASS DOOR WERE CLOSED I
COULD NOT SEE INTO THE INTERIOR AND BOTH MY EYES AND SPIRIT SEEMED DRAWN
FROM THE GLOOMY HOUSE FROM THE GREY HOLLOW FILLED WITH RAYLESS CELLS AS
IT APPEARED TO ME TO THAT SKY EXPANDED BEFORE ME A BLUE SEA ABSOLVED
FROM TAINT OF CLOUD THE MOON ASCENDING IT IN SOLEMN MARCH HER ORB
SEEMING TO LOOK UP AS SHE LEFT THE HILL TOPS FROM BEHIND WHICH SHE HAD
COME FAR AND FARTHER BELOW HER AND ASPIRED TO THE ZENITH MIDNIGHT DARK
IN ITS FATHOMLESS DEPTH AND MEASURELESS DISTANCE AND FOR THOSE TREMBLING
STARS THAT FOLLOWED HER COURSE THEY MADE MY HEART TREMBLE MY VEINS GLOW
WHEN I VIEWED THEM
LITTLE THINGS RECALL US TO EARTH THE CLOCK STRUCK
IN THE HALL THAT SUFFICED I TURNED FROM MOON AND STARS OPENED A SIDE
DOOR AND WENT IN
THE HALL WAS NOT DARK NOR YET WAS IT LIT ONLY BY THE HIGH HUNG BRONZE
LAMP A WARM GLOW SUFFUSED BOTH IT AND THE LOWER STEPS OF THE OAK
STAIRCASE
THIS RUDDY SHINE ISSUED FROM THE GREAT DINING ROOM WHOSE TWO
LEAVED DOOR STOOD OPEN AND SHOWED A GENIAL FIRE IN THE GRATE GLANCING
ON MARBLE HEARTH AND BRASS FIRE IRONS AND REVEALING PURPLE DRAPERIES AND
POLISHED FURNITURE IN THE MOST PLEASANT RADIANCE
IT REVEALED TOO A
GROUP NEAR THE MANTELPIECE I HAD SCARCELY CAUGHT IT AND SCARCELY BECOME
AWARE OF A CHEERFUL MINGLING OF VOICES AMONGST WHICH I SEEMED TO
DISTINGUISH THE TONES OF ADELE WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED
I HASTENED TO MRS
FAIRFAX'S ROOM THERE WAS A FIRE THERE TOO BUT NO
CANDLE AND NO MRS
FAIRFAX
INSTEAD ALL ALONE SITTING UPRIGHT ON THE
RUG AND GAZING WITH GRAVITY AT THE BLAZE I BEHELD A GREAT BLACK AND
WHITE LONG HAIRED DOG JUST LIKE THE GYTRASH OF THE LANE
IT WAS SO LIKE
IT THAT I WENT FORWARD AND SAID PILOT AND THE THING GOT UP AND CAME TO
ME AND SNUFFED ME
I CARESSED HIM AND HE WAGGED HIS GREAT TAIL BUT HE
LOOKED AN EERIE CREATURE TO BE ALONE WITH AND I COULD NOT TELL WHENCE HE
HAD COME
I RANG THE BELL FOR I WANTED A CANDLE AND I WANTED TOO TO
GET AN ACCOUNT OF THIS VISITANT
LEAH ENTERED
WHAT DOG IS THIS
HE CAME WITH MASTER
WITH WHOM
WITH MASTER MR
ROCHESTER HE IS JUST ARRIVED
INDEED AND IS MRS
FAIRFAX WITH HIM
YES AND MISS ADELE THEY ARE IN THE DINING ROOM AND JOHN IS GONE FOR A
SURGEON FOR MASTER HAS HAD AN ACCIDENT HIS HORSE FELL AND HIS ANKLE IS
SPRAINED
DID THE HORSE FALL IN HAY LANE
YES COMING DOWN HILL IT SLIPPED ON SOME ICE
AH BRING ME A CANDLE WILL YOU LEAH
LEAH BROUGHT IT SHE ENTERED FOLLOWED BY MRS
FAIRFAX WHO REPEATED THE
NEWS ADDING THAT MR
CARTER THE SURGEON WAS COME AND WAS NOW WITH MR
ROCHESTER THEN SHE HURRIED OUT TO GIVE ORDERS ABOUT TEA AND I WENT
UPSTAIRS TO TAKE OFF MY THINGS
CHAPTER XIII
MR
ROCHESTER IT SEEMS BY THE SURGEON'S ORDERS WENT TO BED EARLY THAT
NIGHT NOR DID HE RISE SOON NEXT MORNING
WHEN HE DID COME DOWN IT WAS
TO ATTEND TO BUSINESS HIS AGENT AND SOME OF HIS TENANTS WERE ARRIVED
AND WAITING TO SPEAK WITH HIM
ADELE AND I HAD NOW TO VACATE THE LIBRARY IT WOULD BE IN DAILY
REQUISITION AS A RECEPTION ROOM FOR CALLERS
A FIRE WAS LIT IN AN
APARTMENT UPSTAIRS AND THERE I CARRIED OUR BOOKS AND ARRANGED IT FOR
THE FUTURE SCHOOLROOM
I DISCERNED IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING THAT
THORNFIELD HALL WAS A CHANGED PLACE NO LONGER SILENT AS A CHURCH IT
ECHOED EVERY HOUR OR TWO TO A KNOCK AT THE DOOR OR A CLANG OF THE BELL
STEPS TOO OFTEN TRAVERSED THE HALL AND NEW VOICES SPOKE IN DIFFERENT
KEYS BELOW A RILL FROM THE OUTER WORLD WAS FLOWING THROUGH IT IT HAD A
MASTER FOR MY PART I LIKED IT BETTER
ADELE WAS NOT EASY TO TEACH THAT DAY SHE COULD NOT APPLY SHE KEPT
RUNNING TO THE DOOR AND LOOKING OVER THE BANISTERS TO SEE IF SHE COULD
GET A GLIMPSE OF MR
ROCHESTER THEN SHE COINED PRETEXTS TO GO
DOWNSTAIRS IN ORDER AS I SHREWDLY SUSPECTED TO VISIT THE LIBRARY
WHERE I KNEW SHE WAS NOT WANTED THEN WHEN I GOT A LITTLE ANGRY AND
MADE HER SIT STILL SHE CONTINUED TO TALK INCESSANTLY OF HER AMI
MONSIEUR EDOUARD FAIRFAX DE ROCHESTER AS SHE DUBBED HIM I HAD NOT
BEFORE HEARD HIS PRENOMENS AND TO CONJECTURE WHAT PRESENTS HE HAD
BROUGHT HER FOR IT APPEARS HE HAD INTIMATED THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT WHEN
HIS LUGGAGE CAME FROM MILLCOTE THERE WOULD BE FOUND AMONGST IT A LITTLE
BOX IN WHOSE CONTENTS SHE HAD AN INTEREST
ET CELA DOIT SIGNIFIER SAID SHE QU'IL Y AURA LA DEDANS UN CADEAU
POUR MOI ET PEUT ETRE POUR VOUS AUSSI MADEMOISELLE
MONSIEUR A PARLE
DE VOUS IL M'A DEMANDE LE NOM DE MA GOUVERNANTE ET SI ELLE N'ETAIT PAS
UNE PETITE PERSONNE ASSEZ MINCE ET UN PEU PALE
J'AI DIT QU'OUI CAR
C'EST VRAI N'EST CE PAS MADEMOISELLE
I AND MY PUPIL DINED AS USUAL IN MRS
FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR THE AFTERNOON
WAS WILD AND SNOWY AND WE PASSED IT IN THE SCHOOLROOM
AT DARK I
ALLOWED ADELE TO PUT AWAY BOOKS AND WORK AND TO RUN DOWNSTAIRS FOR
FROM THE COMPARATIVE SILENCE BELOW AND FROM THE CESSATION OF APPEALS TO
THE DOOR BELL I CONJECTURED THAT MR
ROCHESTER WAS NOW AT LIBERTY
LEFT
ALONE I WALKED TO THE WINDOW BUT NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN THENCE
TWILIGHT AND SNOWFLAKES TOGETHER THICKENED THE AIR AND HID THE VERY
SHRUBS ON THE LAWN
I LET DOWN THE CURTAIN AND WENT BACK TO THE
FIRESIDE
IN THE CLEAR EMBERS I WAS TRACING A VIEW NOT UNLIKE A PICTURE I
REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN OF THE CASTLE OF HEIDELBERG ON THE RHINE WHEN
MRS
FAIRFAX CAME IN BREAKING UP BY HER ENTRANCE THE FIERY MOSAIC I HAD
BEEN PIERCING TOGETHER AND SCATTERING TOO SOME HEAVY UNWELCOME THOUGHTS
THAT WERE BEGINNING TO THRONG ON MY SOLITUDE
MR
ROCHESTER WOULD BE GLAD IF YOU AND YOUR PUPIL WOULD TAKE TEA WITH
HIM IN THE DRAWING ROOM THIS EVENING SAID SHE HE HAS BEEN SO MUCH
ENGAGED ALL DAY THAT HE COULD NOT ASK TO SEE YOU BEFORE
WHEN IS HIS TEA TIME I INQUIRED
OH AT SIX O'CLOCK HE KEEPS EARLY HOURS IN THE COUNTRY
YOU HAD BETTER
CHANGE YOUR FROCK NOW I WILL GO WITH YOU AND FASTEN IT
HERE IS A
CANDLE
IS IT NECESSARY TO CHANGE MY FROCK
YES YOU HAD BETTER I ALWAYS DRESS FOR THE EVENING WHEN MR
ROCHESTER
IS HERE
THIS ADDITIONAL CEREMONY SEEMED SOMEWHAT STATELY HOWEVER I REPAIRED TO
MY ROOM AND WITH MRS
FAIRFAX'S AID REPLACED MY BLACK STUFF DRESS BY
ONE OF BLACK SILK THE BEST AND THE ONLY ADDITIONAL ONE I HAD EXCEPT ONE
OF LIGHT GREY WHICH IN MY LOWOOD NOTIONS OF THE TOILETTE I THOUGHT TOO
FINE TO BE WORN EXCEPT ON FIRST RATE OCCASIONS
YOU WANT A BROOCH SAID MRS
FAIRFAX
I HAD A SINGLE LITTLE PEARL
ORNAMENT WHICH MISS TEMPLE GAVE ME AS A PARTING KEEPSAKE I PUT IT ON
AND THEN WE WENT DOWNSTAIRS
UNUSED AS I WAS TO STRANGERS IT WAS RATHER
A TRIAL TO APPEAR THUS FORMALLY SUMMONED IN MR
ROCHESTER'S PRESENCE
I
LET MRS
FAIRFAX PRECEDE ME INTO THE DINING ROOM AND KEPT IN HER SHADE
AS WE CROSSED THAT APARTMENT AND PASSING THE ARCH WHOSE CURTAIN WAS
NOW DROPPED ENTERED THE ELEGANT RECESS BEYOND
TWO WAX CANDLES STOOD LIGHTED ON THE TABLE AND TWO ON THE MANTELPIECE
BASKING IN THE LIGHT AND HEAT OF A SUPERB FIRE LAY PILOT ADELE KNELT
NEAR HIM
HALF RECLINED ON A COUCH APPEARED MR
ROCHESTER HIS FOOT
SUPPORTED BY THE CUSHION HE WAS LOOKING AT ADELE AND THE DOG THE FIRE
SHONE FULL ON HIS FACE
I KNEW MY TRAVELLER WITH HIS BROAD AND JETTY
EYEBROWS HIS SQUARE FOREHEAD MADE SQUARER BY THE HORIZONTAL SWEEP OF
HIS BLACK HAIR
I RECOGNISED HIS DECISIVE NOSE MORE REMARKABLE FOR
CHARACTER THAN BEAUTY HIS FULL NOSTRILS DENOTING I THOUGHT CHOLER
HIS GRIM MOUTH CHIN AND JAW YES ALL THREE WERE VERY GRIM AND NO
MISTAKE
HIS SHAPE NOW DIVESTED OF CLOAK I PERCEIVED HARMONISED IN
SQUARENESS WITH HIS PHYSIOGNOMY I SUPPOSE IT WAS A GOOD FIGURE IN THE
ATHLETIC SENSE OF THE TERM BROAD CHESTED AND THIN FLANKED THOUGH
NEITHER TALL NOR GRACEFUL
MR
ROCHESTER MUST HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE ENTRANCE OF MRS
FAIRFAX AND
MYSELF BUT IT APPEARED HE WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO NOTICE US FOR HE NEVER
LIFTED HIS HEAD AS WE APPROACHED
HERE IS MISS EYRE SIR SAID MRS
FAIRFAX IN HER QUIET WAY
HE BOWED
STILL NOT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THE GROUP OF THE DOG AND CHILD
LET MISS EYRE BE SEATED SAID HE AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE FORCED
STIFF BOW IN THE IMPATIENT YET FORMAL TONE WHICH SEEMED FURTHER TO
EXPRESS WHAT THE DEUCE IS IT TO ME WHETHER MISS EYRE BE THERE OR NOT
AT THIS MOMENT I AM NOT DISPOSED TO ACCOST HER
I SAT DOWN QUITE DISEMBARRASSED
A RECEPTION OF FINISHED POLITENESS
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE CONFUSED ME I COULD NOT HAVE RETURNED OR REPAID IT
BY ANSWERING GRACE AND ELEGANCE ON MY PART BUT HARSH CAPRICE LAID ME
UNDER NO OBLIGATION ON THE CONTRARY A DECENT QUIESCENCE UNDER THE
FREAK OF MANNER GAVE ME THE ADVANTAGE
BESIDES THE ECCENTRICITY OF THE
PROCEEDING WAS PIQUANT I FELT INTERESTED TO SEE HOW HE WOULD GO ON
HE WENT ON AS A STATUE WOULD THAT IS HE NEITHER SPOKE NOR MOVED
MRS
FAIRFAX SEEMED TO THINK IT NECESSARY THAT SOME ONE SHOULD BE AMIABLE AND
SHE BEGAN TO TALK
KINDLY AS USUAL AND AS USUAL RATHER TRITE SHE
CONDOLED WITH HIM ON THE PRESSURE OF BUSINESS HE HAD HAD ALL DAY ON THE
ANNOYANCE IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO HIM WITH THAT PAINFUL SPRAIN THEN SHE
COMMENDED HIS PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE IN GOING THROUGH WITH IT
MADAM I SHOULD LIKE SOME TEA WAS THE SOLE REJOINDER SHE GOT
SHE
HASTENED TO RING THE BELL AND WHEN THE TRAY CAME SHE PROCEEDED TO
ARRANGE THE CUPS SPOONS C WITH ASSIDUOUS CELERITY
I AND ADELE WENT
TO THE TABLE BUT THE MASTER DID NOT LEAVE HIS COUCH
WILL YOU HAND MR
ROCHESTER'S CUP SAID MRS
FAIRFAX TO ME ADELE
MIGHT PERHAPS SPILL IT
I DID AS REQUESTED
AS HE TOOK THE CUP FROM MY HAND ADELE THINKING THE
MOMENT PROPITIOUS FOR MAKING A REQUEST IN MY FAVOUR CRIED OUT
N'EST CE PAS MONSIEUR QU'IL Y A UN CADEAU POUR MADEMOISELLE EYRE DANS
VOTRE PETIT COFFRE
WHO TALKS OF CADEAUX SAID HE GRUFFLY
DID YOU EXPECT A PRESENT MISS
EYRE ARE YOU FOND OF PRESENTS AND HE SEARCHED MY FACE WITH EYES THAT
I SAW WERE DARK IRATE AND PIERCING
I HARDLY KNOW SIR I HAVE LITTLE EXPERIENCE OF THEM THEY ARE GENERALLY
THOUGHT PLEASANT THINGS
GENERALLY THOUGHT BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO TAKE TIME SIR BEFORE I COULD GIVE YOU AN ANSWER
WORTHY OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE A PRESENT HAS MANY FACES TO IT HAS IT NOT
AND ONE SHOULD CONSIDER ALL BEFORE PRONOUNCING AN OPINION AS TO ITS
NATURE
MISS EYRE YOU ARE NOT SO UNSOPHISTICATED AS ADELE SHE DEMANDS A
'CADEAU CLAMOROUSLY THE MOMENT SHE SEES ME YOU BEAT ABOUT THE BUSH
BECAUSE I HAVE LESS CONFIDENCE IN MY DESERTS THAN ADELE HAS SHE CAN
PREFER THE CLAIM OF OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND THE RIGHT TOO OF CUSTOM FOR
SHE SAYS YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE HABIT OF GIVING HER PLAYTHINGS BUT
IF I HAD TO MAKE OUT A CASE I SHOULD BE PUZZLED SINCE I AM A STRANGER
AND HAVE DONE NOTHING TO ENTITLE ME TO AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT
OH DON'T FALL BACK ON OVER MODESTY I HAVE EXAMINED ADELE AND FIND
YOU HAVE TAKEN GREAT PAINS WITH HER SHE IS NOT BRIGHT SHE HAS NO
TALENTS YET IN A SHORT TIME SHE HAS MADE MUCH IMPROVEMENT
SIR YOU HAVE NOW GIVEN ME MY 'CADEAU I AM OBLIGED TO YOU IT IS THE
MEED TEACHERS MOST COVET PRAISE OF THEIR PUPILS' PROGRESS
HUMPH SAID MR
ROCHESTER AND HE TOOK HIS TEA IN SILENCE
COME TO THE FIRE SAID THE MASTER WHEN THE TRAY WAS TAKEN AWAY AND
MRS
FAIRFAX HAD SETTLED INTO A CORNER WITH HER KNITTING WHILE ADELE WAS
LEADING ME BY THE HAND ROUND THE ROOM SHOWING ME THE BEAUTIFUL BOOKS AND
ORNAMENTS ON THE CONSOLES AND CHIFFONNIERES
WE OBEYED AS IN DUTY
BOUND ADELE WANTED TO TAKE A SEAT ON MY KNEE BUT SHE WAS ORDERED TO
AMUSE HERSELF WITH PILOT
YOU HAVE BEEN RESIDENT IN MY HOUSE THREE MONTHS
YES SIR
AND YOU CAME FROM
FROM LOWOOD SCHOOL IN SHIRE
AH A CHARITABLE CONCERN
HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE
EIGHT YEARS
EIGHT YEARS YOU MUST BE TENACIOUS OF LIFE
I THOUGHT HALF THE TIME IN
SUCH A PLACE WOULD HAVE DONE UP ANY CONSTITUTION NO WONDER YOU HAVE
RATHER THE LOOK OF ANOTHER WORLD
I MARVELLED WHERE YOU HAD GOT THAT
SORT OF FACE
WHEN YOU CAME ON ME IN HAY LANE LAST NIGHT I THOUGHT
UNACCOUNTABLY OF FAIRY TALES AND HAD HALF A MIND TO DEMAND WHETHER YOU
HAD BEWITCHED MY HORSE I AM NOT SURE YET
WHO ARE YOUR PARENTS
I HAVE NONE
NOR EVER HAD I SUPPOSE DO YOU REMEMBER THEM
NO
I THOUGHT NOT
AND SO YOU WERE WAITING FOR YOUR PEOPLE WHEN YOU SAT ON
THAT STILE
FOR WHOM SIR
FOR THE MEN IN GREEN IT WAS A PROPER MOONLIGHT EVENING FOR THEM
DID I
BREAK THROUGH ONE OF YOUR RINGS THAT YOU SPREAD THAT DAMNED ICE ON THE
CAUSEWAY
I SHOOK MY HEAD
THE MEN IN GREEN ALL FORSOOK ENGLAND A HUNDRED YEARS
AGO SAID I SPEAKING AS SERIOUSLY AS HE HAD DONE
AND NOT EVEN IN HAY
LANE OR THE FIELDS ABOUT IT COULD YOU FIND A TRACE OF THEM
I DON'T
THINK EITHER SUMMER OR HARVEST OR WINTER MOON WILL EVER SHINE ON THEIR
REVELS MORE
MRS
FAIRFAX HAD DROPPED HER KNITTING AND WITH RAISED EYEBROWS SEEMED
WONDERING WHAT SORT OF TALK THIS WAS
WELL RESUMED MR
ROCHESTER IF YOU DISOWN PARENTS YOU MUST HAVE SOME
SORT OF KINSFOLK UNCLES AND AUNTS
NO NONE THAT I EVER SAW
AND YOUR HOME
I HAVE NONE
WHERE DO YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS LIVE
I HAVE NO BROTHERS OR SISTERS
WHO RECOMMENDED YOU TO COME HERE
I ADVERTISED AND MRS
FAIRFAX ANSWERED MY ADVERTISEMENT
YES SAID THE GOOD LADY WHO NOW KNEW WHAT GROUND WE WERE UPON AND I
AM DAILY THANKFUL FOR THE CHOICE PROVIDENCE LED ME TO MAKE
MISS EYRE
HAS BEEN AN INVALUABLE COMPANION TO ME AND A KIND AND CAREFUL TEACHER TO
ADELE
DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF TO GIVE HER A CHARACTER RETURNED MR
ROCHESTER
EULOGIUMS WILL NOT BIAS ME I SHALL JUDGE FOR MYSELF
SHE BEGAN BY
FELLING MY HORSE
SIR SAID MRS
FAIRFAX
I HAVE TO THANK HER FOR THIS SPRAIN
THE WIDOW LOOKED BEWILDERED
MISS EYRE HAVE YOU EVER LIVED IN A TOWN
NO SIR
HAVE YOU SEEN MUCH SOCIETY
NONE BUT THE PUPILS AND TEACHERS OF LOWOOD AND NOW THE INMATES OF
THORNFIELD
HAVE YOU READ MUCH
ONLY SUCH BOOKS AS CAME IN MY WAY AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NUMEROUS OR
VERY LEARNED
YOU HAVE LIVED THE LIFE OF A NUN NO DOUBT YOU ARE WELL DRILLED IN
RELIGIOUS FORMS BROCKLEHURST WHO I UNDERSTAND DIRECTS LOWOOD IS A
PARSON IS HE NOT
YES SIR
AND YOU GIRLS PROBABLY WORSHIPPED HIM AS A CONVENT FULL OF RELIGIEUSES
WOULD WORSHIP THEIR DIRECTOR
OH NO
YOU ARE VERY COOL NO WHAT A NOVICE NOT WORSHIP HER PRIEST THAT
SOUNDS BLASPHEMOUS
I DISLIKED MR
BROCKLEHURST AND I WAS NOT ALONE IN THE FEELING
HE IS
A HARSH MAN AT ONCE POMPOUS AND MEDDLING HE CUT OFF OUR HAIR AND FOR
ECONOMY'S SAKE BOUGHT US BAD NEEDLES AND THREAD WITH WHICH WE COULD
HARDLY SEW
THAT WAS VERY FALSE ECONOMY REMARKED MRS
FAIRFAX WHO NOW AGAIN
CAUGHT THE DRIFT OF THE DIALOGUE
AND WAS THAT THE HEAD AND FRONT OF HIS OFFENDING DEMANDED MR
ROCHESTER
HE STARVED US WHEN HE HAD THE SOLE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE PROVISION
DEPARTMENT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED AND HE BORED US WITH LONG
LECTURES ONCE A WEEK AND WITH EVENING READINGS FROM BOOKS OF HIS OWN
INDITING ABOUT SUDDEN DEATHS AND JUDGMENTS WHICH MADE US AFRAID TO GO
TO BED
WHAT AGE WERE YOU WHEN YOU WENT TO LOWOOD
ABOUT TEN
AND YOU STAYED THERE EIGHT YEARS YOU ARE NOW THEN EIGHTEEN
I ASSENTED
ARITHMETIC YOU SEE IS USEFUL WITHOUT ITS AID I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO GUESS YOUR AGE
IT IS A POINT DIFFICULT TO FIX WHERE THE
FEATURES AND COUNTENANCE ARE SO MUCH AT VARIANCE AS IN YOUR CASE
AND
NOW WHAT DID YOU LEARN AT LOWOOD CAN YOU PLAY
A LITTLE
OF COURSE THAT IS THE ESTABLISHED ANSWER
GO INTO THE LIBRARY I MEAN
IF YOU PLEASE EXCUSE MY TONE OF COMMAND I AM USED TO SAY 'DO THIS
AND IT IS DONE I CANNOT ALTER MY CUSTOMARY HABITS FOR ONE NEW
INMATE GO THEN INTO THE LIBRARY TAKE A CANDLE WITH YOU LEAVE THE
DOOR OPEN SIT DOWN TO THE PIANO AND PLAY A TUNE
I DEPARTED OBEYING HIS DIRECTIONS
ENOUGH HE CALLED OUT IN A FEW MINUTES
YOU PLAY A LITTLE I SEE
LIKE ANY OTHER ENGLISH SCHOOL GIRL PERHAPS RATHER BETTER THAN SOME BUT
NOT WELL
I CLOSED THE PIANO AND RETURNED
MR
ROCHESTER CONTINUED ADELE SHOWED
ME SOME SKETCHES THIS MORNING WHICH SHE SAID WERE YOURS
I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER THEY WERE ENTIRELY OF YOUR DOING PROBABLY A MASTER AIDED YOU
NO INDEED I INTERJECTED
AH THAT PRICKS PRIDE
WELL FETCH ME YOUR PORTFOLIO IF YOU CAN VOUCH
FOR ITS CONTENTS BEING ORIGINAL BUT DON'T PASS YOUR WORD UNLESS YOU ARE
CERTAIN I CAN RECOGNISE PATCHWORK
THEN I WILL SAY NOTHING AND YOU SHALL JUDGE FOR YOURSELF SIR
I BROUGHT THE PORTFOLIO FROM THE LIBRARY
APPROACH THE TABLE SAID HE AND I WHEELED IT TO HIS COUCH
ADELE AND
MRS
FAIRFAX DREW NEAR TO SEE THE PICTURES
NO CROWDING SAID MR
ROCHESTER TAKE THE DRAWINGS FROM MY HAND AS I
FINISH WITH THEM BUT DON'T PUSH YOUR FACES UP TO MINE
HE DELIBERATELY SCRUTINISED EACH SKETCH AND PAINTING
THREE HE LAID
ASIDE THE OTHERS WHEN HE HAD EXAMINED THEM HE SWEPT FROM HIM
TAKE THEM OFF TO THE OTHER TABLE MRS
FAIRFAX SAID HE AND LOOK AT
THEM WITH ADELE YOU GLANCING AT ME RESUME YOUR SEAT AND ANSWER MY
QUESTIONS
I PERCEIVE THOSE PICTURES WERE DONE BY ONE HAND WAS THAT
HAND YOURS
YES
AND WHEN DID YOU FIND TIME TO DO THEM THEY HAVE TAKEN MUCH TIME AND
SOME THOUGHT
I DID THEM IN THE LAST TWO VACATIONS I SPENT AT LOWOOD WHEN I HAD NO
OTHER OCCUPATION
WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR COPIES
OUT OF MY HEAD
THAT HEAD I SEE NOW ON YOUR SHOULDERS
YES SIR
HAS IT OTHER FURNITURE OF THE SAME KIND WITHIN
I SHOULD THINK IT MAY HAVE I SHOULD HOPE BETTER
HE SPREAD THE PICTURES BEFORE HIM AND AGAIN SURVEYED THEM ALTERNATELY
WHILE HE IS SO OCCUPIED I WILL TELL YOU READER WHAT THEY ARE AND
FIRST I MUST PREMISE THAT THEY ARE NOTHING WONDERFUL
THE SUBJECTS HAD
INDEED RISEN VIVIDLY ON MY MIND
AS I SAW THEM WITH THE SPIRITUAL EYE
BEFORE I ATTEMPTED TO EMBODY THEM THEY WERE STRIKING BUT MY HAND WOULD
NOT SECOND MY FANCY AND IN EACH CASE IT HAD WROUGHT OUT BUT A PALE
PORTRAIT OF THE THING I HAD CONCEIVED
THESE PICTURES WERE IN WATER COLOURS
THE FIRST REPRESENTED CLOUDS LOW
AND LIVID ROLLING OVER A SWOLLEN SEA ALL THE DISTANCE WAS IN ECLIPSE
SO TOO WAS THE FOREGROUND OR RATHER THE NEAREST BILLOWS FOR THERE
WAS NO LAND
ONE GLEAM OF LIGHT LIFTED INTO RELIEF A HALF SUBMERGED
MAST ON WHICH SAT A CORMORANT DARK AND LARGE WITH WINGS FLECKED WITH
FOAM ITS BEAK HELD A GOLD BRACELET SET WITH GEMS THAT I HAD TOUCHED
WITH AS BRILLIANT TINTS AS MY PALETTE COULD YIELD AND AS GLITTERING
DISTINCTNESS AS MY PENCIL COULD IMPART
SINKING BELOW THE BIRD AND MAST
A DROWNED CORPSE GLANCED THROUGH THE GREEN WATER A FAIR ARM WAS THE ONLY
LIMB CLEARLY VISIBLE WHENCE THE BRACELET HAD BEEN WASHED OR TORN
THE SECOND PICTURE CONTAINED FOR FOREGROUND ONLY THE DIM PEAK OF A HILL
WITH GRASS AND SOME LEAVES SLANTING AS IF BY A BREEZE
BEYOND AND ABOVE
SPREAD AN EXPANSE OF SKY DARK BLUE AS AT TWILIGHT RISING INTO THE SKY
WAS A WOMAN'S SHAPE TO THE BUST PORTRAYED IN TINTS AS DUSK AND SOFT AS I
COULD COMBINE
THE DIM FOREHEAD WAS CROWNED WITH A STAR THE LINEAMENTS
BELOW WERE SEEN AS THROUGH THE SUFFUSION OF VAPOUR THE EYES SHONE DARK
AND WILD THE HAIR STREAMED SHADOWY LIKE A BEAMLESS CLOUD TORN BY STORM
OR BY ELECTRIC TRAVAIL
ON THE NECK LAY A PALE REFLECTION LIKE
MOONLIGHT THE SAME FAINT LUSTRE TOUCHED THE TRAIN OF THIN CLOUDS FROM
WHICH ROSE AND BOWED THIS VISION OF THE EVENING STAR
THE THIRD SHOWED THE PINNACLE OF AN ICEBERG PIERCING A POLAR WINTER SKY
A MUSTER OF NORTHERN LIGHTS REARED THEIR DIM LANCES CLOSE SERRIED ALONG
THE HORIZON
THROWING THESE INTO DISTANCE ROSE IN THE FOREGROUND A
HEAD A COLOSSAL HEAD INCLINED TOWARDS THE ICEBERG AND RESTING AGAINST
IT
TWO THIN HANDS JOINED UNDER THE FOREHEAD AND SUPPORTING IT DREW
UP BEFORE THE LOWER FEATURES A SABLE VEIL A BROW QUITE BLOODLESS WHITE
AS BONE AND AN EYE HOLLOW AND FIXED BLANK OF MEANING BUT FOR THE
GLASSINESS OF DESPAIR ALONE WERE VISIBLE
ABOVE THE TEMPLES AMIDST
WREATHED TURBAN FOLDS OF BLACK DRAPERY VAGUE IN ITS CHARACTER AND
CONSISTENCY AS CLOUD GLEAMED A RING OF WHITE FLAME GEMMED WITH SPARKLES
OF A MORE LURID TINGE
THIS PALE CRESCENT WAS THE LIKENESS OF A KINGLY
CROWN WHAT IT DIADEMED WAS THE SHAPE WHICH SHAPE HAD NONE
WERE YOU HAPPY WHEN YOU PAINTED THESE PICTURES ASKED MR
ROCHESTER
PRESENTLY
I WAS ABSORBED SIR YES AND I WAS HAPPY
TO PAINT THEM IN SHORT WAS
TO ENJOY ONE OF THE KEENEST PLEASURES I HAVE EVER KNOWN
THAT IS NOT SAYING MUCH
YOUR PLEASURES BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN
FEW BUT I DARESAY YOU DID EXIST IN A KIND OF ARTIST'S DREAMLAND WHILE
YOU BLENT AND ARRANGED THESE STRANGE TINTS
DID YOU SIT AT THEM LONG
EACH DAY
I HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO BECAUSE IT WAS THE VACATION AND I SAT AT THEM
FROM MORNING TILL NOON AND FROM NOON TILL NIGHT THE LENGTH OF THE
MIDSUMMER DAYS FAVOURED MY INCLINATION TO APPLY
AND YOU FELT SELF SATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF YOUR ARDENT LABOURS
FAR FROM IT
I WAS TORMENTED BY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN MY IDEA AND MY
HANDIWORK IN EACH CASE I HAD IMAGINED SOMETHING WHICH I WAS QUITE
POWERLESS TO REALISE
NOT QUITE YOU HAVE SECURED THE SHADOW OF YOUR THOUGHT BUT NO MORE
PROBABLY
YOU HAD NOT ENOUGH OF THE ARTIST'S SKILL AND SCIENCE TO GIVE
IT FULL BEING YET THE DRAWINGS ARE FOR A SCHOOL GIRL PECULIAR
AS TO
THE THOUGHTS THEY ARE ELFISH
THESE EYES IN THE EVENING STAR YOU MUST
HAVE SEEN IN A DREAM
HOW COULD YOU MAKE THEM LOOK SO CLEAR AND YET NOT
AT ALL BRILLIANT FOR THE PLANET ABOVE QUELLS THEIR RAYS
AND WHAT
MEANING IS THAT IN THEIR SOLEMN DEPTH AND WHO TAUGHT YOU TO PAINT WIND
THERE IS A HIGH GALE IN THAT SKY AND ON THIS HILL TOP
WHERE DID YOU
SEE LATMOS FOR THAT IS LATMOS
THERE PUT THE DRAWINGS AWAY
I HAD SCARCE TIED THE STRINGS OF THE PORTFOLIO WHEN LOOKING AT HIS
WATCH HE SAID ABRUPTLY
IT IS NINE O'CLOCK WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT MISS EYRE TO LET ADELE SIT UP
SO LONG TAKE HER TO BED
ADELE WENT TO KISS HIM BEFORE QUITTING THE ROOM HE ENDURED THE CARESS
BUT SCARCELY SEEMED TO RELISH IT MORE THAN PILOT WOULD HAVE DONE NOR SO
MUCH
I WISH YOU ALL GOOD NIGHT NOW SAID HE MAKING A MOVEMENT OF THE HAND
TOWARDS THE DOOR IN TOKEN THAT HE WAS TIRED OF OUR COMPANY AND WISHED
TO DISMISS US
MRS
FAIRFAX FOLDED UP HER KNITTING I TOOK MY PORTFOLIO
WE CURTSEYED TO HIM RECEIVED A FRIGID BOW IN RETURN AND SO WITHDREW
YOU SAID MR
ROCHESTER WAS NOT STRIKINGLY PECULIAR MRS
FAIRFAX I
OBSERVED WHEN I REJOINED HER IN HER ROOM AFTER PUTTING ADELE TO BED
WELL IS HE
I THINK SO HE IS VERY CHANGEFUL AND ABRUPT
TRUE NO DOUBT HE MAY APPEAR SO TO A STRANGER BUT I AM SO ACCUSTOMED TO
HIS MANNER I NEVER THINK OF IT AND THEN IF HE HAS PECULIARITIES OF
TEMPER ALLOWANCE SHOULD BE MADE
WHY
PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS HIS NATURE AND WE CAN NONE OF US HELP OUR NATURE
AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE HAS PAINFUL THOUGHTS NO DOUBT TO HARASS HIM AND
MAKE HIS SPIRITS UNEQUAL
WHAT ABOUT
FAMILY TROUBLES FOR ONE THING
BUT HE HAS NO FAMILY
NOT NOW BUT HE HAS HAD OR AT LEAST RELATIVES
HE LOST HIS ELDER
BROTHER A FEW YEARS SINCE
HIS ELDER BROTHER
YES
THE PRESENT MR
ROCHESTER HAS NOT BEEN VERY LONG IN POSSESSION OF
THE PROPERTY ONLY ABOUT NINE YEARS
NINE YEARS IS A TOLERABLE TIME
WAS HE SO VERY FOND OF HIS BROTHER AS
TO BE STILL INCONSOLABLE FOR HIS LOSS
WHY NO PERHAPS NOT
I BELIEVE THERE WERE SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS
BETWEEN THEM
MR
ROWLAND ROCHESTER WAS NOT QUITE JUST TO MR
EDWARD
AND PERHAPS HE PREJUDICED HIS FATHER AGAINST HIM
THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS
FOND OF MONEY AND ANXIOUS TO KEEP THE FAMILY ESTATE TOGETHER
HE DID
NOT LIKE TO DIMINISH THE PROPERTY BY DIVISION AND YET HE WAS ANXIOUS
THAT MR
EDWARD SHOULD HAVE WEALTH TOO TO KEEP UP THE CONSEQUENCE OF
THE NAME AND SOON AFTER HE WAS OF AGE SOME STEPS WERE TAKEN THAT WERE
NOT QUITE FAIR AND MADE A GREAT DEAL OF MISCHIEF
OLD MR
ROCHESTER AND
MR
ROWLAND COMBINED TO BRING MR
EDWARD INTO WHAT HE CONSIDERED A
PAINFUL POSITION FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING HIS FORTUNE WHAT THE PRECISE
NATURE OF THAT POSITION WAS I NEVER CLEARLY KNEW BUT HIS SPIRIT COULD
NOT BROOK WHAT HE HAD TO SUFFER IN IT
HE IS NOT VERY FORGIVING HE
BROKE WITH HIS FAMILY AND NOW FOR MANY YEARS HE HAS LED AN UNSETTLED
KIND OF LIFE
I DON'T THINK HE HAS EVER BEEN RESIDENT AT THORNFIELD FOR
A FORTNIGHT TOGETHER SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER WITHOUT A WILL LEFT
HIM MASTER OF THE ESTATE AND INDEED NO WONDER HE SHUNS THE OLD PLACE
WHY SHOULD HE SHUN IT
PERHAPS HE THINKS IT GLOOMY
THE ANSWER WAS EVASIVE
I SHOULD HAVE LIKED SOMETHING CLEARER BUT MRS
FAIRFAX EITHER COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT GIVE ME MORE EXPLICIT INFORMATION
OF THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF MR
ROCHESTER'S TRIALS
SHE AVERRED THEY
WERE A MYSTERY TO HERSELF AND THAT WHAT SHE KNEW WAS CHIEFLY FROM
CONJECTURE
IT WAS EVIDENT INDEED THAT SHE WISHED ME TO DROP THE
SUBJECT WHICH I DID ACCORDINGLY
CHAPTER XIV
FOR SEVERAL SUBSEQUENT DAYS I SAW LITTLE OF MR
ROCHESTER
IN THE
MORNINGS HE SEEMED MUCH ENGAGED WITH BUSINESS AND IN THE AFTERNOON
GENTLEMEN FROM MILLCOTE OR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD CALLED AND SOMETIMES STAYED
TO DINE WITH HIM
WHEN HIS SPRAIN WAS WELL ENOUGH TO ADMIT OF HORSE
EXERCISE HE RODE OUT A GOOD DEAL PROBABLY TO RETURN THESE VISITS AS HE
GENERALLY DID NOT COME BACK TILL LATE AT NIGHT
DURING THIS INTERVAL EVEN ADELE WAS SELDOM SENT FOR TO HIS PRESENCE AND
ALL MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM WAS CONFINED TO AN OCCASIONAL RENCONTRE IN
THE HALL ON THE STAIRS OR IN THE GALLERY WHEN HE WOULD SOMETIMES PASS
ME HAUGHTILY AND COLDLY JUST ACKNOWLEDGING MY PRESENCE BY A DISTANT NOD
OR A COOL GLANCE AND SOMETIMES BOW AND SMILE WITH GENTLEMANLIKE
AFFABILITY
HIS CHANGES OF MOOD DID NOT OFFEND ME BECAUSE I SAW THAT I
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR ALTERNATION THE EBB AND FLOW DEPENDED ON
CAUSES QUITE DISCONNECTED WITH ME
ONE DAY HE HAD HAD COMPANY TO DINNER AND HAD SENT FOR MY PORTFOLIO IN
ORDER DOUBTLESS TO EXHIBIT ITS CONTENTS THE GENTLEMEN WENT AWAY EARLY
TO ATTEND A PUBLIC MEETING AT MILLCOTE AS MRS
FAIRFAX INFORMED ME BUT
THE NIGHT BEING WET AND INCLEMENT MR
ROCHESTER DID NOT ACCOMPANY THEM
SOON AFTER THEY WERE GONE HE RANG THE BELL A MESSAGE CAME THAT I AND
ADELE WERE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
I BRUSHED ADELE'S HAIR AND MADE HER NEAT
AND HAVING ASCERTAINED THAT I WAS MYSELF IN MY USUAL QUAKER TRIM WHERE
THERE WAS NOTHING TO RETOUCH ALL BEING TOO CLOSE AND PLAIN BRAIDED
LOCKS INCLUDED TO ADMIT OF DISARRANGEMENT WE DESCENDED ADELE WONDERING
WHETHER THE PETIT COFFRE WAS AT LENGTH COME FOR OWING TO SOME
MISTAKE ITS ARRIVAL HAD HITHERTO BEEN DELAYED
SHE WAS GRATIFIED THERE
IT STOOD A LITTLE CARTON ON THE TABLE WHEN WE ENTERED THE DINING ROOM
SHE APPEARED TO KNOW IT BY INSTINCT
MA BOITE MA BOITE EXCLAIMED SHE RUNNING TOWARDS IT
YES THERE IS YOUR 'BOITE' AT LAST TAKE IT INTO A CORNER YOU GENUINE
DAUGHTER OF PARIS AND AMUSE YOURSELF WITH DISEMBOWELLING IT SAID THE
DEEP AND RATHER SARCASTIC VOICE OF MR
ROCHESTER PROCEEDING FROM THE
DEPTHS OF AN IMMENSE EASY CHAIR AT THE FIRESIDE
AND MIND HE
CONTINUED DON'T BOTHER ME WITH ANY DETAILS OF THE ANATOMICAL PROCESS
OR ANY NOTICE OF THE CONDITION OF THE ENTRAILS LET YOUR OPERATION BE
CONDUCTED IN SILENCE TIENS TOI TRANQUILLE ENFANT COMPRENDS TU
ADELE SEEMED SCARCELY TO NEED THE WARNING SHE HAD ALREADY RETIRED TO A
SOFA WITH HER TREASURE AND WAS BUSY UNTYING THE CORD WHICH SECURED THE
LID
HAVING REMOVED THIS IMPEDIMENT AND LIFTED CERTAIN SILVERY
ENVELOPES OF TISSUE PAPER SHE MERELY EXCLAIMED
OH CIEL QUE C'EST BEAU AND THEN REMAINED ABSORBED IN ECSTATIC
CONTEMPLATION
IS MISS EYRE THERE NOW DEMANDED THE MASTER HALF RISING FROM HIS SEAT
TO LOOK ROUND TO THE DOOR NEAR WHICH I STILL STOOD
AH WELL COME FORWARD BE SEATED HERE HE DREW A CHAIR NEAR HIS OWN
I AM NOT FOND OF THE PRATTLE OF CHILDREN HE CONTINUED FOR OLD
BACHELOR AS I AM I HAVE NO PLEASANT ASSOCIATIONS CONNECTED WITH THEIR
LISP
IT WOULD BE INTOLERABLE TO ME TO PASS A WHOLE EVENING
TETE A TETE WITH A BRAT
DON'T DRAW THAT CHAIR FARTHER OFF MISS EYRE
SIT DOWN EXACTLY WHERE I PLACED IT IF YOU PLEASE THAT IS
CONFOUND
THESE CIVILITIES I CONTINUALLY FORGET THEM
NOR DO I PARTICULARLY
AFFECT SIMPLE MINDED OLD LADIES
BY THE BYE I MUST HAVE MINE IN MIND
IT WON'T DO TO NEGLECT HER SHE IS A FAIRFAX OR WED TO ONE AND BLOOD IS
SAID TO BE THICKER THAN WATER
HE RANG AND DESPATCHED AN INVITATION TO MRS
FAIRFAX WHO SOON ARRIVED
KNITTING BASKET IN HAND
GOOD EVENING MADAM I SENT TO YOU FOR A CHARITABLE PURPOSE
I HAVE
FORBIDDEN ADELE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT HER PRESENTS AND SHE IS BURSTING
WITH REPLETION HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SERVE HER AS AUDITRESS AND
INTERLOCUTRICE IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST BENEVOLENT ACTS YOU EVER
PERFORMED
ADELE INDEED NO SOONER SAW MRS
FAIRFAX THAN SHE SUMMONED HER TO HER
SOFA AND THERE QUICKLY FILLED HER LAP WITH THE PORCELAIN THE IVORY THE
WAXEN CONTENTS OF HER BOITE POURING OUT MEANTIME EXPLANATIONS AND
RAPTURES IN SUCH BROKEN ENGLISH AS SHE WAS MISTRESS OF
NOW I HAVE PERFORMED THE PART OF A GOOD HOST PURSUED MR
ROCHESTER
PUT MY GUESTS INTO THE WAY OF AMUSING EACH OTHER I OUGHT TO BE AT
LIBERTY TO ATTEND TO MY OWN PLEASURE
MISS EYRE DRAW YOUR CHAIR STILL A
LITTLE FARTHER FORWARD YOU ARE YET TOO FAR BACK I CANNOT SEE YOU
WITHOUT DISTURBING MY POSITION IN THIS COMFORTABLE CHAIR WHICH I HAVE NO
MIND TO DO
I DID AS I WAS BID THOUGH I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE REMAINED SOMEWHAT IN
THE SHADE BUT MR
ROCHESTER HAD SUCH A DIRECT WAY OF GIVING ORDERS IT
SEEMED A MATTER OF COURSE TO OBEY HIM PROMPTLY
WE WERE AS I HAVE SAID IN THE DINING ROOM THE LUSTRE WHICH HAD BEEN
LIT FOR DINNER FILLED THE ROOM WITH A FESTAL BREADTH OF LIGHT THE LARGE
FIRE WAS ALL RED AND CLEAR THE PURPLE CURTAINS HUNG RICH AND AMPLE
BEFORE THE LOFTY WINDOW AND LOFTIER ARCH EVERYTHING WAS STILL SAVE THE
SUBDUED CHAT OF ADELE SHE DARED NOT SPEAK LOUD AND FILLING UP EACH
PAUSE THE BEATING OF WINTER RAIN AGAINST THE PANES
MR
ROCHESTER AS HE SAT IN HIS DAMASK COVERED CHAIR LOOKED DIFFERENT TO
WHAT I HAD SEEN HIM LOOK BEFORE NOT QUITE SO STERN MUCH LESS GLOOMY
THERE WAS A SMILE ON HIS LIPS AND HIS EYES SPARKLED WHETHER WITH WINE
OR NOT I AM NOT SURE BUT I THINK IT VERY PROBABLE
HE WAS IN SHORT
IN HIS AFTER DINNER MOOD MORE EXPANDED AND GENIAL AND ALSO MORE SELF
INDULGENT THAN THE FRIGID AND RIGID TEMPER OF THE MORNING STILL HE
LOOKED PRECIOUSLY GRIM CUSHIONING HIS MASSIVE HEAD AGAINST THE SWELLING
BACK OF HIS CHAIR AND RECEIVING THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE ON HIS GRANITE
HEWN FEATURES AND IN HIS GREAT DARK EYES FOR HE HAD GREAT DARK EYES
AND VERY FINE EYES TOO NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN CHANGE IN THEIR DEPTHS
SOMETIMES WHICH IF IT WAS NOT SOFTNESS REMINDED YOU AT LEAST OF THAT
FEELING
HE HAD BEEN LOOKING TWO MINUTES AT THE FIRE AND I HAD BEEN LOOKING THE
SAME LENGTH OF TIME AT HIM WHEN TURNING SUDDENLY HE CAUGHT MY GAZE
FASTENED ON HIS PHYSIOGNOMY
YOU EXAMINE ME MISS EYRE SAID HE DO YOU THINK ME HANDSOME
I SHOULD IF I HAD DELIBERATED HAVE REPLIED TO THIS QUESTION BY
SOMETHING CONVENTIONALLY VAGUE AND POLITE BUT THE ANSWER SOMEHOW SLIPPED
FROM MY TONGUE BEFORE I WAS AWARE NO SIR
AH BY MY WORD THERE IS SOMETHING SINGULAR ABOUT YOU SAID HE YOU
HAVE THE AIR OF A LITTLE NONNETTE QUAINT QUIET GRAVE AND SIMPLE AS
YOU SIT WITH YOUR HANDS BEFORE YOU AND YOUR EYES GENERALLY BENT ON THE
CARPET EXCEPT BY THE BYE WHEN THEY ARE DIRECTED PIERCINGLY TO MY FACE
AS JUST NOW FOR INSTANCE AND WHEN ONE ASKS YOU A QUESTION OR MAKES A
REMARK TO WHICH YOU ARE OBLIGED TO REPLY YOU RAP OUT A ROUND REJOINDER
WHICH IF NOT BLUNT IS AT LEAST BRUSQUE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IT
SIR I WAS TOO PLAIN I BEG YOUR PARDON
I OUGHT TO HAVE REPLIED THAT
IT WAS NOT EASY TO GIVE AN IMPROMPTU ANSWER TO A QUESTION ABOUT
APPEARANCES THAT TASTES MOSTLY DIFFER AND THAT BEAUTY IS OF LITTLE
CONSEQUENCE OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE REPLIED NO SUCH THING
BEAUTY OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE
INDEED AND SO UNDER PRETENCE OF SOFTENING THE PREVIOUS OUTRAGE OF
STROKING AND SOOTHING ME INTO PLACIDITY YOU STICK A SLY PENKNIFE UNDER
MY EAR GO ON WHAT FAULT DO YOU FIND WITH ME PRAY I SUPPOSE I HAVE
ALL MY LIMBS AND ALL MY FEATURES LIKE ANY OTHER MAN
MR
ROCHESTER ALLOW ME TO DISOWN MY FIRST ANSWER I INTENDED NO POINTED
REPARTEE IT WAS ONLY A BLUNDER
JUST SO I THINK SO AND YOU SHALL BE ANSWERABLE FOR IT
CRITICISE ME
DOES MY FOREHEAD NOT PLEASE YOU
HE LIFTED UP THE SABLE WAVES OF HAIR WHICH LAY HORIZONTALLY OVER HIS
BROW AND SHOWED A SOLID ENOUGH MASS OF INTELLECTUAL ORGANS BUT AN
ABRUPT DEFICIENCY WHERE THE SUAVE SIGN OF BENEVOLENCE SHOULD HAVE RISEN
NOW MA'AM AM I A FOOL
FAR FROM IT SIR
YOU WOULD PERHAPS THINK ME RUDE IF I INQUIRED IN
RETURN WHETHER YOU ARE A PHILANTHROPIST
THERE AGAIN ANOTHER STICK OF THE PENKNIFE WHEN SHE PRETENDED TO PAT
MY HEAD AND THAT IS BECAUSE I SAID I DID NOT LIKE THE SOCIETY OF
CHILDREN AND OLD WOMEN LOW BE IT SPOKEN
NO YOUNG LADY I AM NOT A
GENERAL PHILANTHROPIST BUT I BEAR A CONSCIENCE AND HE POINTED TO THE
PROMINENCES WHICH ARE SAID TO INDICATE THAT FACULTY AND WHICH
FORTUNATELY FOR HIM WERE SUFFICIENTLY CONSPICUOUS GIVING INDEED A
MARKED BREADTH TO THE UPPER PART OF HIS HEAD AND BESIDES I ONCE HAD A
KIND OF RUDE TENDERNESS OF HEART
WHEN I WAS AS OLD AS YOU I WAS A
FEELING FELLOW ENOUGH PARTIAL TO THE UNFLEDGED UNFOSTERED AND UNLUCKY
BUT FORTUNE HAS KNOCKED ME ABOUT SINCE SHE HAS EVEN KNEADED ME WITH HER
KNUCKLES AND NOW I FLATTER MYSELF I AM HARD AND TOUGH AS AN INDIA RUBBER
BALL PERVIOUS THOUGH THROUGH A CHINK OR TWO STILL AND WITH ONE
SENTIENT POINT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LUMP
YES DOES THAT LEAVE HOPE FOR
ME
HOPE OF WHAT SIR
OF MY FINAL RE TRANSFORMATION FROM INDIA RUBBER BACK TO FLESH
DECIDEDLY HE HAS HAD TOO MUCH WINE I THOUGHT AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT
ANSWER TO MAKE TO HIS QUEER QUESTION HOW COULD I TELL WHETHER HE WAS
CAPABLE OF BEING RE TRANSFORMED
YOU LOOKED VERY MUCH PUZZLED MISS EYRE AND THOUGH YOU ARE NOT PRETTY
ANY MORE THAN I AM HANDSOME YET A PUZZLED AIR BECOMES YOU BESIDES IT
IS CONVENIENT FOR IT KEEPS THOSE SEARCHING EYES OF YOURS AWAY FROM MY
PHYSIOGNOMY AND BUSIES THEM WITH THE WORSTED FLOWERS OF THE RUG SO
PUZZLE ON
YOUNG LADY I AM DISPOSED TO BE GREGARIOUS AND COMMUNICATIVE
TO NIGHT
WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND STOOD LEANING HIS ARM
ON THE MARBLE MANTELPIECE IN THAT ATTITUDE HIS SHAPE WAS SEEN PLAINLY AS
WELL AS HIS FACE HIS UNUSUAL BREADTH OF CHEST DISPROPORTIONATE ALMOST
TO HIS LENGTH OF LIMB
I AM SURE MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIM AN
UGLY MAN YET THERE WAS SO MUCH UNCONSCIOUS PRIDE IN HIS PORT SO MUCH
EASE IN HIS DEMEANOUR SUCH A LOOK OF COMPLETE INDIFFERENCE TO HIS OWN
EXTERNAL APPEARANCE SO HAUGHTY A RELIANCE ON THE POWER OF OTHER
QUALITIES INTRINSIC OR ADVENTITIOUS TO ATONE FOR THE LACK OF MERE
PERSONAL ATTRACTIVENESS THAT IN LOOKING AT HIM ONE INEVITABLY SHARED
THE INDIFFERENCE AND EVEN IN A BLIND IMPERFECT SENSE PUT FAITH IN THE
CONFIDENCE
I AM DISPOSED TO BE GREGARIOUS AND COMMUNICATIVE TO NIGHT HE REPEATED
AND THAT IS WHY I SENT FOR YOU THE FIRE AND THE CHANDELIER WERE NOT
SUFFICIENT COMPANY FOR ME NOR WOULD PILOT HAVE BEEN FOR NONE OF THESE
CAN TALK
ADELE IS A DEGREE BETTER BUT STILL FAR BELOW THE MARK MRS
FAIRFAX DITTO YOU I AM PERSUADED CAN SUIT ME IF YOU WILL YOU PUZZLED
ME THE FIRST EVENING I INVITED YOU DOWN HERE
I HAVE ALMOST FORGOTTEN
YOU SINCE OTHER IDEAS HAVE DRIVEN YOURS FROM MY HEAD BUT TO NIGHT I AM
RESOLVED TO BE AT EASE TO DISMISS WHAT IMPORTUNES AND RECALL WHAT
PLEASES
IT WOULD PLEASE ME NOW TO DRAW YOU OUT TO LEARN MORE OF
YOU THEREFORE SPEAK
INSTEAD OF SPEAKING I SMILED AND NOT A VERY COMPLACENT OR SUBMISSIVE
SMILE EITHER
SPEAK HE URGED
WHAT ABOUT SIR
WHATEVER YOU LIKE
I LEAVE BOTH THE CHOICE OF SUBJECT AND THE MANNER OF
TREATING IT ENTIRELY TO YOURSELF
ACCORDINGLY I SAT AND SAID NOTHING IF HE EXPECTS ME TO TALK FOR THE
MERE SAKE OF TALKING AND SHOWING OFF HE WILL FIND HE HAS ADDRESSED
HIMSELF TO THE WRONG PERSON I THOUGHT
YOU ARE DUMB MISS EYRE
I WAS DUMB STILL
HE BENT HIS HEAD A LITTLE TOWARDS ME AND WITH A
SINGLE HASTY GLANCE SEEMED TO DIVE INTO MY EYES
STUBBORN HE SAID AND ANNOYED
AH IT IS CONSISTENT
I PUT MY
REQUEST IN AN ABSURD ALMOST INSOLENT FORM
MISS EYRE I BEG YOUR
PARDON
THE FACT IS ONCE FOR ALL I DON'T WISH TO TREAT YOU LIKE AN
INFERIOR THAT IS CORRECTING HIMSELF I CLAIM ONLY SUCH SUPERIORITY
AS MUST RESULT FROM TWENTY YEARS' DIFFERENCE IN AGE AND A CENTURY'S
ADVANCE IN EXPERIENCE
THIS IS LEGITIMATE ET J'Y TIENS AS ADELE
WOULD SAY AND IT IS BY VIRTUE OF THIS SUPERIORITY AND THIS ALONE THAT
I DESIRE YOU TO HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TALK TO ME A LITTLE NOW AND DIVERT
MY THOUGHTS WHICH ARE GALLED WITH DWELLING ON ONE POINT CANKERING AS A
RUSTY NAIL
HE HAD DEIGNED AN EXPLANATION ALMOST AN APOLOGY AND I DID NOT FEEL
INSENSIBLE TO HIS CONDESCENSION AND WOULD NOT SEEM SO
I AM WILLING TO AMUSE YOU IF I CAN SIR QUITE WILLING BUT I CANNOT
INTRODUCE A TOPIC BECAUSE HOW DO I KNOW WHAT WILL INTEREST YOU ASK ME
QUESTIONS AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER THEM
THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE DO YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO BE
A LITTLE MASTERFUL ABRUPT PERHAPS EXACTING SOMETIMES ON THE GROUNDS I
STATED NAMELY THAT I AM OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR FATHER AND THAT I HAVE
BATTLED THROUGH A VARIED EXPERIENCE WITH MANY MEN OF MANY NATIONS AND
ROAMED OVER HALF THE GLOBE WHILE YOU HAVE LIVED QUIETLY WITH ONE SET OF
PEOPLE IN ONE HOUSE
DO AS YOU PLEASE SIR
THAT IS NO ANSWER OR RATHER IT IS A VERY IRRITATING BECAUSE A VERY
EVASIVE ONE
REPLY CLEARLY
I DON'T THINK SIR YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO COMMAND ME MERELY BECAUSE YOU
ARE OLDER THAN I OR BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I HAVE
YOUR CLAIM TO SUPERIORITY DEPENDS ON THE USE YOU HAVE MADE OF YOUR TIME
AND EXPERIENCE
HUMPH PROMPTLY SPOKEN
BUT I WON'T ALLOW THAT SEEING THAT IT WOULD
NEVER SUIT MY CASE AS I HAVE MADE AN INDIFFERENT NOT TO SAY A BAD USE
OF BOTH ADVANTAGES
LEAVING SUPERIORITY OUT OF THE QUESTION THEN YOU
MUST STILL AGREE TO RECEIVE MY ORDERS NOW AND THEN WITHOUT BEING PIQUED
OR HURT BY THE TONE OF COMMAND
WILL YOU
I SMILED I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MR
ROCHESTER IS PECULIAR HE SEEMS TO
FORGET THAT HE PAYS ME 30 POUNDS PER ANNUM FOR RECEIVING HIS ORDERS
THE SMILE IS VERY WELL SAID HE CATCHING INSTANTLY THE PASSING
EXPRESSION BUT SPEAK TOO
I WAS THINKING SIR THAT VERY FEW MASTERS WOULD TROUBLE THEMSELVES TO
INQUIRE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR PAID SUBORDINATES WERE PIQUED AND HURT BY
THEIR ORDERS
PAID SUBORDINATES WHAT YOU ARE MY PAID SUBORDINATE ARE YOU OH YES
I HAD FORGOTTEN THE SALARY WELL THEN ON THAT MERCENARY GROUND WILL
YOU AGREE TO LET ME HECTOR A LITTLE
NO SIR NOT ON THAT GROUND BUT ON THE GROUND THAT YOU DID FORGET IT
AND THAT YOU CARE WHETHER OR NOT A DEPENDENT IS COMFORTABLE IN HIS
DEPENDENCY I AGREE HEARTILY
AND WILL YOU CONSENT TO DISPENSE WITH A GREAT MANY CONVENTIONAL FORMS
AND PHRASES WITHOUT THINKING THAT THE OMISSION ARISES FROM INSOLENCE
I AM SURE SIR I SHOULD NEVER MISTAKE INFORMALITY FOR INSOLENCE ONE I
RATHER LIKE THE OTHER NOTHING FREE BORN WOULD SUBMIT TO EVEN FOR A
SALARY
HUMBUG MOST THINGS FREE BORN WILL SUBMIT TO ANYTHING FOR A SALARY
THEREFORE KEEP TO YOURSELF AND DON'T VENTURE ON GENERALITIES OF WHICH
YOU ARE INTENSELY IGNORANT
HOWEVER I MENTALLY SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU FOR
YOUR ANSWER DESPITE ITS INACCURACY AND AS MUCH FOR THE MANNER IN WHICH
IT WAS SAID AS FOR THE SUBSTANCE OF THE SPEECH THE MANNER WAS FRANK AND
SINCERE ONE DOES NOT OFTEN SEE SUCH A MANNER NO ON THE CONTRARY
AFFECTATION OR COLDNESS OR STUPID COARSE MINDED MISAPPREHENSION OF
ONE'S MEANING ARE THE USUAL REWARDS OF CANDOUR
NOT THREE IN THREE
THOUSAND RAW SCHOOL GIRL GOVERNESSES WOULD HAVE ANSWERED ME AS YOU HAVE
JUST DONE
BUT I DON'T MEAN TO FLATTER YOU IF YOU ARE CAST IN A
DIFFERENT MOULD TO THE MAJORITY IT IS NO MERIT OF YOURS NATURE DID IT
AND THEN AFTER ALL I GO TOO FAST IN MY CONCLUSIONS FOR WHAT I YET
KNOW YOU MAY BE NO BETTER THAN THE REST YOU MAY HAVE INTOLERABLE
DEFECTS TO COUNTERBALANCE YOUR FEW GOOD POINTS
AND SO MAY YOU I THOUGHT
MY EYE MET HIS AS THE IDEA CROSSED MY MIND
HE SEEMED TO READ THE GLANCE ANSWERING AS IF ITS IMPORT HAD BEEN SPOKEN
AS WELL AS IMAGINED
YES YES YOU ARE RIGHT SAID HE I HAVE PLENTY OF FAULTS OF MY OWN I
KNOW IT AND I DON'T WISH TO PALLIATE THEM I ASSURE YOU
GOD WOT I NEED
NOT BE TOO SEVERE ABOUT OTHERS I HAVE A PAST EXISTENCE A SERIES OF
DEEDS A COLOUR OF LIFE TO CONTEMPLATE WITHIN MY OWN BREAST WHICH MIGHT
WELL CALL MY SNEERS AND CENSURES FROM MY NEIGHBOURS TO MYSELF
I
STARTED OR RATHER FOR LIKE OTHER DEFAULTERS I LIKE TO LAY HALF THE
BLAME ON ILL FORTUNE AND ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS THRUST ON TO A WRONG
TACK AT THE AGE OF ONE AND TWENTY AND HAVE NEVER RECOVERED THE RIGHT
COURSE SINCE BUT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS
GOOD AS YOU WISER ALMOST AS STAINLESS
I ENVY YOU YOUR PEACE OF MIND
YOUR CLEAN CONSCIENCE YOUR UNPOLLUTED MEMORY
LITTLE GIRL A MEMORY
WITHOUT BLOT OR CONTAMINATION MUST BE AN EXQUISITE TREASURE AN
INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF PURE REFRESHMENT IS IT NOT
HOW WAS YOUR MEMORY WHEN YOU WERE EIGHTEEN SIR
ALL RIGHT THEN LIMPID SALUBRIOUS NO GUSH OF BILGE WATER HAD TURNED IT
TO FETID PUDDLE
I WAS YOUR EQUAL AT EIGHTEEN QUITE YOUR EQUAL
NATURE
MEANT ME TO BE ON THE WHOLE A GOOD MAN MISS EYRE ONE OF THE BETTER
KIND AND YOU SEE I AM NOT SO
YOU WOULD SAY YOU DON'T SEE IT AT LEAST
I FLATTER MYSELF I READ AS MUCH IN YOUR EYE BEWARE BY THE BYE WHAT YOU
EXPRESS WITH THAT ORGAN I AM QUICK AT INTERPRETING ITS LANGUAGE
THEN
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT I AM NOT A VILLAIN YOU ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THAT NOT
TO ATTRIBUTE TO ME ANY SUCH BAD EMINENCE BUT OWING I VERILY BELIEVE
RATHER TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAN TO MY NATURAL BENT I AM A TRITE COMMONPLACE
SINNER HACKNEYED IN ALL THE POOR PETTY DISSIPATIONS WITH WHICH THE RICH
AND WORTHLESS TRY TO PUT ON LIFE
DO YOU WONDER THAT I AVOW THIS TO YOU
KNOW THAT IN THE COURSE OF YOUR FUTURE LIFE YOU WILL OFTEN FIND YOURSELF
ELECTED THE INVOLUNTARY CONFIDANT OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCES' SECRETS PEOPLE
WILL INSTINCTIVELY FIND OUT AS I HAVE DONE THAT IT IS NOT YOUR FORTE TO
TELL OF YOURSELF BUT TO LISTEN WHILE OTHERS TALK OF THEMSELVES THEY
WILL FEEL TOO THAT YOU LISTEN WITH NO MALEVOLENT SCORN OF THEIR
INDISCRETION BUT WITH A KIND OF INNATE SYMPATHY NOT THE LESS COMFORTING
AND ENCOURAGING BECAUSE IT IS VERY UNOBTRUSIVE IN ITS MANIFESTATIONS
HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU GUESS ALL THIS SIR
I KNOW IT WELL THEREFORE I PROCEED ALMOST AS FREELY AS IF I WERE
WRITING MY THOUGHTS IN A DIARY
YOU WOULD SAY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
SUPERIOR TO CIRCUMSTANCES SO I SHOULD SO I SHOULD BUT YOU SEE I WAS
NOT
WHEN FATE WRONGED ME I HAD NOT THE WISDOM TO REMAIN COOL I TURNED
DESPERATE THEN I DEGENERATED
NOW WHEN ANY VICIOUS SIMPLETON EXCITES
MY DISGUST BY HIS PALTRY RIBALDRY I CANNOT FLATTER MYSELF THAT I AM
BETTER THAN HE I AM FORCED TO CONFESS THAT HE AND I ARE ON A LEVEL
I
WISH I HAD STOOD FIRM GOD KNOWS I DO DREAD REMORSE WHEN YOU ARE
TEMPTED TO ERR MISS EYRE REMORSE IS THE POISON OF LIFE
REPENTANCE IS SAID TO BE ITS CURE SIR
IT IS NOT ITS CURE
REFORMATION MAY BE ITS CURE AND I COULD REFORM I
HAVE STRENGTH YET FOR THAT IF BUT WHERE IS THE USE OF THINKING OF IT
HAMPERED BURDENED CURSED AS I AM BESIDES SINCE HAPPINESS IS
IRREVOCABLY DENIED ME I HAVE A RIGHT TO GET PLEASURE OUT OF LIFE AND I
WILL GET IT COST WHAT IT MAY
THEN YOU WILL DEGENERATE STILL MORE SIR
POSSIBLY YET WHY SHOULD I IF I CAN GET SWEET FRESH PLEASURE AND I
MAY GET IT AS SWEET AND FRESH AS THE WILD HONEY THE BEE GATHERS ON THE
MOOR
IT WILL STING IT WILL TASTE BITTER SIR
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU NEVER TRIED IT
HOW VERY SERIOUS HOW VERY SOLEMN
YOU LOOK AND YOU ARE AS IGNORANT OF THE MATTER AS THIS CAMEO HEAD
TAKING ONE FROM THE MANTELPIECE
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO PREACH TO ME
YOU NEOPHYTE THAT HAVE NOT PASSED THE PORCH OF LIFE AND ARE ABSOLUTELY
UNACQUAINTED WITH ITS MYSTERIES
I ONLY REMIND YOU OF YOUR OWN WORDS SIR YOU SAID ERROR BROUGHT
REMORSE AND YOU PRONOUNCED REMORSE THE POISON OF EXISTENCE
AND WHO TALKS OF ERROR NOW I SCARCELY THINK THE NOTION THAT FLITTERED
ACROSS MY BRAIN WAS AN ERROR
I BELIEVE IT WAS AN INSPIRATION RATHER
THAN A TEMPTATION IT WAS VERY GENIAL VERY SOOTHING I KNOW THAT
HERE
IT COMES AGAIN IT IS NO DEVIL I ASSURE YOU OR IF IT BE IT HAS PUT ON
THE ROBES OF AN ANGEL OF LIGHT
I THINK I MUST ADMIT SO FAIR A GUEST
WHEN IT ASKS ENTRANCE TO MY HEART
DISTRUST IT SIR IT IS NOT A TRUE ANGEL
ONCE MORE HOW DO YOU KNOW BY WHAT INSTINCT DO YOU PRETEND TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A FALLEN SERAPH OF THE ABYSS AND A MESSENGER FROM THE
ETERNAL THRONE BETWEEN A GUIDE AND A SEDUCER
I JUDGED BY YOUR COUNTENANCE SIR WHICH WAS TROUBLED WHEN YOU SAID THE
SUGGESTION HAD RETURNED UPON YOU
I FEEL SURE IT WILL WORK YOU MORE
MISERY IF YOU LISTEN TO IT
NOT AT ALL IT BEARS THE MOST GRACIOUS MESSAGE IN THE WORLD FOR THE
REST YOU ARE NOT MY CONSCIENCE KEEPER SO DON'T MAKE YOURSELF UNEASY
HERE COME IN BONNY WANDERER
HE SAID THIS AS IF HE SPOKE TO A VISION VIEWLESS TO ANY EYE BUT HIS OWN
THEN FOLDING HIS ARMS WHICH HE HAD HALF EXTENDED ON HIS CHEST HE
SEEMED TO ENCLOSE IN THEIR EMBRACE THE INVISIBLE BEING
NOW HE CONTINUED AGAIN ADDRESSING ME I HAVE RECEIVED THE PILGRIM A
DISGUISED DEITY AS I VERILY BELIEVE
ALREADY IT HAS DONE ME GOOD MY
HEART WAS A SORT OF CHARNEL IT WILL NOW BE A SHRINE
TO SPEAK TRUTH SIR I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL I CANNOT KEEP UP THE
CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT HAS GOT OUT OF MY DEPTH
ONLY ONE THING I
KNOW YOU SAID YOU WERE NOT AS GOOD AS YOU SHOULD LIKE TO BE AND THAT
YOU REGRETTED YOUR OWN IMPERFECTION ONE THING I CAN COMPREHEND YOU
INTIMATED THAT TO HAVE A SULLIED MEMORY WAS A PERPETUAL BANE
IT SEEMS
TO ME THAT IF YOU TRIED HARD YOU WOULD IN TIME FIND IT POSSIBLE TO
BECOME WHAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD APPROVE AND THAT IF FROM THIS DAY YOU
BEGAN WITH RESOLUTION TO CORRECT YOUR THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS YOU WOULD IN
A FEW YEARS HAVE LAID UP A NEW AND STAINLESS STORE OF RECOLLECTIONS TO
WHICH YOU MIGHT REVERT WITH PLEASURE
JUSTLY THOUGHT RIGHTLY SAID MISS EYRE AND AT THIS MOMENT I AM
PAVING HELL WITH ENERGY
SIR
I AM LAYING DOWN GOOD INTENTIONS WHICH I BELIEVE DURABLE AS FLINT
CERTAINLY MY ASSOCIATES AND PURSUITS SHALL BE OTHER THAN THEY HAVE
BEEN
AND BETTER
AND BETTER SO MUCH BETTER AS PURE ORE IS THAN FOUL DROSS
YOU SEEM TO
DOUBT ME I DON'T DOUBT MYSELF I KNOW WHAT MY AIM IS WHAT MY MOTIVES
ARE AND AT THIS MOMENT I PASS A LAW UNALTERABLE AS THAT OF THE MEDES
AND PERSIANS THAT BOTH ARE RIGHT
THEY CANNOT BE SIR IF THEY REQUIRE A NEW STATUTE TO LEGALISE THEM
THEY ARE MISS EYRE THOUGH THEY ABSOLUTELY REQUIRE A NEW STATUTE
UNHEARD OF COMBINATIONS OF CIRCUMSTANCES DEMAND UNHEARD OF RULES
THAT SOUNDS A DANGEROUS MAXIM SIR BECAUSE ONE CAN SEE AT ONCE THAT IT
IS LIABLE TO ABUSE
SENTENTIOUS SAGE SO IT IS BUT I SWEAR BY MY HOUSEHOLD GODS NOT TO
ABUSE IT
YOU ARE HUMAN AND FALLIBLE
I AM SO ARE YOU WHAT THEN
THE HUMAN AND FALLIBLE SHOULD NOT ARROGATE A POWER WITH WHICH THE DIVINE
AND PERFECT ALONE CAN BE SAFELY INTRUSTED
WHAT POWER
THAT OF SAYING OF ANY STRANGE UNSANCTIONED LINE OF ACTION 'LET IT BE
RIGHT
'LET IT BE RIGHT' THE VERY WORDS YOU HAVE PRONOUNCED THEM
MAY IT BE RIGHT THEN I SAID AS I ROSE DEEMING IT USELESS TO
CONTINUE A DISCOURSE WHICH WAS ALL DARKNESS TO ME AND BESIDES SENSIBLE
THAT THE CHARACTER OF MY INTERLOCUTOR WAS BEYOND MY PENETRATION AT
LEAST BEYOND ITS PRESENT REACH AND FEELING THE UNCERTAINTY THE VAGUE
SENSE OF INSECURITY WHICH ACCOMPANIES A CONVICTION OF IGNORANCE
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
TO PUT ADELE TO BED IT IS PAST HER BEDTIME
YOU ARE AFRAID OF ME BECAUSE I TALK LIKE A SPHYNX
YOUR LANGUAGE IS ENIGMATICAL SIR BUT THOUGH I AM BEWILDERED I AM
CERTAINLY NOT AFRAID
YOU ARE AFRAID YOUR SELF LOVE DREADS A BLUNDER
IN THAT SENSE I DO FEEL APPREHENSIVE I HAVE NO WISH TO TALK NONSENSE
IF YOU DID IT WOULD BE IN SUCH A GRAVE QUIET MANNER I SHOULD MISTAKE
IT FOR SENSE
DO YOU NEVER LAUGH MISS EYRE DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF TO
ANSWER I SEE YOU LAUGH RARELY BUT YOU CAN LAUGH VERY MERRILY BELIEVE
ME YOU ARE NOT NATURALLY AUSTERE ANY MORE THAN I AM NATURALLY VICIOUS
THE LOWOOD CONSTRAINT STILL CLINGS TO YOU SOMEWHAT CONTROLLING YOUR
FEATURES MUFFLING YOUR VOICE AND RESTRICTING YOUR LIMBS AND YOU FEAR
IN THE PRESENCE OF A MAN AND A BROTHER OR FATHER OR MASTER OR WHAT YOU
WILL TO SMILE TOO GAILY SPEAK TOO FREELY OR MOVE TOO QUICKLY BUT IN
TIME I THINK YOU WILL LEARN TO BE NATURAL WITH ME AS I FIND IT
IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CONVENTIONAL WITH YOU AND THEN YOUR LOOKS AND MOVEMENTS
WILL HAVE MORE VIVACITY AND VARIETY THAN THEY DARE OFFER NOW
I SEE AT
INTERVALS THE GLANCE OF A CURIOUS SORT OF BIRD THROUGH THE CLOSE SET BARS
OF A CAGE A VIVID RESTLESS RESOLUTE CAPTIVE IS THERE WERE IT BUT
FREE IT WOULD SOAR CLOUD HIGH
YOU ARE STILL BENT ON GOING
IT HAS STRUCK NINE SIR
NEVER MIND WAIT A MINUTE ADELE IS NOT READY TO GO TO BED YET
MY
POSITION MISS EYRE WITH MY BACK TO THE FIRE AND MY FACE TO THE ROOM
FAVOURS OBSERVATION
WHILE TALKING TO YOU I HAVE ALSO OCCASIONALLY
WATCHED ADELE I HAVE MY OWN REASONS FOR THINKING HER A CURIOUS
STUDY REASONS THAT I MAY NAY THAT I SHALL IMPART TO YOU SOME DAY
SHE PULLED OUT OF HER BOX ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO A LITTLE PINK SILK
FROCK RAPTURE LIT HER FACE AS SHE UNFOLDED IT COQUETRY RUNS IN HER
BLOOD BLENDS WITH HER BRAINS AND SEASONS THE MARROW OF HER BONES
'IL
FAUT QUE JE L'ESSAIE CRIED SHE 'ET A L'INSTANT MEME AND SHE RUSHED
OUT OF THE ROOM
SHE IS NOW WITH SOPHIE UNDERGOING A ROBING PROCESS IN
A FEW MINUTES SHE WILL RE ENTER AND I KNOW WHAT I SHALL SEE A
MINIATURE OF CELINE VARENS AS SHE USED TO APPEAR ON THE BOARDS AT THE
RISING OF BUT NEVER MIND THAT
HOWEVER MY TENDEREST FEELINGS ARE ABOUT
TO RECEIVE A SHOCK SUCH IS MY PRESENTIMENT STAY NOW TO SEE WHETHER IT
WILL BE REALISED
ERE LONG ADELE'S LITTLE FOOT WAS HEARD TRIPPING ACROSS THE HALL
SHE
ENTERED TRANSFORMED AS HER GUARDIAN HAD PREDICTED
A DRESS OF
ROSE COLOURED SATIN VERY SHORT AND AS FULL IN THE SKIRT AS IT COULD BE
GATHERED REPLACED THE BROWN FROCK SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY WORN A WREATH OF
ROSEBUDS CIRCLED HER FOREHEAD HER FEET WERE DRESSED IN SILK STOCKINGS
AND SMALL WHITE SATIN SANDALS
EST CE QUE MA ROBE VA BIEN CRIED SHE BOUNDING FORWARDS ET MES
SOULIERS ET MES BAS TENEZ JE CROIS QUE JE VAIS DANSER
AND SPREADING OUT HER DRESS SHE CHASSEED ACROSS THE ROOM TILL HAVING
REACHED MR
ROCHESTER SHE WHEELED LIGHTLY ROUND BEFORE HIM ON TIP TOE
THEN DROPPED ON ONE KNEE AT HIS FEET EXCLAIMING
MONSIEUR JE VOUS REMERCIE MILLE FOIS DE VOTRE BONTE THEN RISING SHE
ADDED C'EST COMME CELA QUE MAMAN FAISAIT N'EST CE PAS MONSIEUR
PRE CISE LY WAS THE ANSWER AND 'COMME CELA SHE CHARMED MY ENGLISH
GOLD OUT OF MY BRITISH BREECHES' POCKET
I HAVE BEEN GREEN TOO MISS
EYRE AY GRASS GREEN NOT A MORE VERNAL TINT FRESHENS YOU NOW THAN ONCE
FRESHENED ME
MY SPRING IS GONE HOWEVER BUT IT HAS LEFT ME THAT FRENCH
FLOWERET ON MY HANDS WHICH IN SOME MOODS I WOULD FAIN BE RID OF
NOT
VALUING NOW THE ROOT WHENCE IT SPRANG HAVING FOUND THAT IT WAS OF A SORT
WHICH NOTHING BUT GOLD DUST COULD MANURE I HAVE BUT HALF A LIKING TO THE
BLOSSOM ESPECIALLY WHEN IT LOOKS SO ARTIFICIAL AS JUST NOW
I KEEP IT
AND REAR IT RATHER ON THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PRINCIPLE OF EXPIATING NUMEROUS
SINS GREAT OR SMALL BY ONE GOOD WORK
I'LL EXPLAIN ALL THIS SOME DAY
GOOD NIGHT
CHAPTER XV
MR
ROCHESTER DID ON A FUTURE OCCASION EXPLAIN IT
IT WAS ONE
AFTERNOON WHEN HE CHANCED TO MEET ME AND ADELE IN THE GROUNDS AND WHILE
SHE PLAYED WITH PILOT AND HER SHUTTLECOCK HE ASKED ME TO WALK UP AND
DOWN A LONG BEECH AVENUE WITHIN SIGHT OF HER
HE THEN SAID THAT SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A FRENCH OPERA DANCER CELINE
VARENS TOWARDS WHOM HE HAD ONCE CHERISHED WHAT HE CALLED A GRANDE
PASSION THIS PASSION CELINE HAD PROFESSED TO RETURN WITH EVEN
SUPERIOR ARDOUR
HE THOUGHT HIMSELF HER IDOL UGLY AS HE WAS HE
BELIEVED AS HE SAID THAT SHE PREFERRED HIS TAILLE D'ATHLETE TO THE
ELEGANCE OF THE APOLLO BELVIDERE
AND MISS EYRE SO MUCH WAS I FLATTERED BY THIS PREFERENCE OF THE GALLIC
SYLPH FOR HER BRITISH GNOME THAT I INSTALLED HER IN AN HOTEL GAVE HER A
COMPLETE ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS A CARRIAGE CASHMERES DIAMONDS
DENTELLES C
IN SHORT I BEGAN THE PROCESS OF RUINING MYSELF IN THE
RECEIVED STYLE LIKE ANY OTHER SPOONY
I HAD NOT IT SEEMS THE
ORIGINALITY TO CHALK OUT A NEW ROAD TO SHAME AND DESTRUCTION BUT TRODE
THE OLD TRACK WITH STUPID EXACTNESS NOT TO DEVIATE AN INCH FROM THE
BEATEN CENTRE
I HAD AS I DESERVED TO HAVE THE FATE OF ALL OTHER
SPOONIES
HAPPENING TO CALL ONE EVENING WHEN CELINE DID NOT EXPECT ME I
FOUND HER OUT BUT IT WAS A WARM NIGHT AND I WAS TIRED WITH STROLLING
THROUGH PARIS SO I SAT DOWN IN HER BOUDOIR HAPPY TO BREATHE THE AIR
CONSECRATED SO LATELY BY HER PRESENCE
NO I EXAGGERATE I NEVER
THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY CONSECRATING VIRTUE ABOUT HER IT WAS RATHER A SORT
OF PASTILLE PERFUME SHE HAD LEFT A SCENT OF MUSK AND AMBER THAN AN
ODOUR OF SANCTITY
I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO STIFLE WITH THE FUMES OF
CONSERVATORY FLOWERS AND SPRINKLED ESSENCES WHEN I BETHOUGHT MYSELF TO
OPEN THE WINDOW AND STEP OUT ON TO THE BALCONY
IT WAS MOONLIGHT AND
GASLIGHT BESIDES AND VERY STILL AND SERENE
THE BALCONY WAS FURNISHED
WITH A CHAIR OR TWO I SAT DOWN AND TOOK OUT A CIGAR I WILL TAKE ONE
NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
HERE ENSUED A PAUSE FILLED UP BY THE PRODUCING AND LIGHTING OF A CIGAR
HAVING PLACED IT TO HIS LIPS AND BREATHED A TRAIL OF HAVANNAH INCENSE ON
THE FREEZING AND SUNLESS AIR HE WENT ON
I LIKED BONBONS TOO IN THOSE DAYS MISS EYRE AND I WAS
CROQUANT OVERLOOK THE BARBARISM CROQUANT CHOCOLATE COMFITS AND
SMOKING ALTERNATELY WATCHING MEANTIME THE EQUIPAGES THAT ROLLED ALONG
THE FASHIONABLE STREETS TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOURING OPERA HOUSE WHEN IN AN
ELEGANT CLOSE CARRIAGE DRAWN BY A BEAUTIFUL PAIR OF ENGLISH HORSES AND
DISTINCTLY SEEN IN THE BRILLIANT CITY NIGHT I RECOGNISED THE 'VOITURE' I
HAD GIVEN CELINE
SHE WAS RETURNING OF COURSE MY HEART THUMPED WITH
IMPATIENCE AGAINST THE IRON RAILS I LEANT UPON
THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AS
I HAD EXPECTED AT THE HOTEL DOOR MY FLAME THAT IS THE VERY WORD FOR AN
OPERA INAMORATA ALIGHTED THOUGH MUFFED IN A CLOAK AN UNNECESSARY
ENCUMBRANCE BY THE BYE ON SO WARM A JUNE EVENING I KNEW HER INSTANTLY
BY HER LITTLE FOOT SEEN PEEPING FROM THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS AS SHE
SKIPPED FROM THE CARRIAGE STEP
BENDING OVER THE BALCONY I WAS ABOUT TO
MURMUR 'MON ANGE' IN A TONE OF COURSE WHICH SHOULD BE AUDIBLE TO THE
EAR OF LOVE ALONE WHEN A FIGURE JUMPED FROM THE CARRIAGE AFTER HER
CLOAKED ALSO BUT THAT WAS A SPURRED HEEL WHICH HAD RUNG ON THE PAVEMENT
AND THAT WAS A HATTED HEAD WHICH NOW PASSED UNDER THE ARCHED PORTE
COCHERE OF THE HOTEL
YOU NEVER FELT JEALOUSY DID YOU MISS EYRE OF COURSE NOT I NEED NOT
ASK YOU BECAUSE YOU NEVER FELT LOVE
YOU HAVE BOTH SENTIMENTS YET TO
EXPERIENCE YOUR SOUL SLEEPS THE SHOCK IS YET TO BE GIVEN WHICH SHALL
WAKEN IT
YOU THINK ALL EXISTENCE LAPSES IN AS QUIET A FLOW AS THAT IN
WHICH YOUR YOUTH HAS HITHERTO SLID AWAY
FLOATING ON WITH CLOSED EYES
AND MUFFLED EARS YOU NEITHER SEE THE ROCKS BRISTLING NOT FAR OFF IN THE
BED OF THE FLOOD NOR HEAR THE BREAKERS BOIL AT THEIR BASE
BUT I TELL
YOU AND YOU MAY MARK MY WORDS YOU WILL COME SOME DAY TO A CRAGGY PASS
IN THE CHANNEL WHERE THE WHOLE OF LIFE'S STREAM WILL BE BROKEN UP INTO
WHIRL AND TUMULT FOAM AND NOISE EITHER YOU WILL BE DASHED TO ATOMS ON
CRAG POINTS OR LIFTED UP AND BORNE ON BY SOME MASTER WAVE INTO A CALMER
CURRENT AS I AM NOW
I LIKE THIS DAY I LIKE THAT SKY OF STEEL I LIKE THE STERNNESS AND
STILLNESS OF THE WORLD UNDER THIS FROST
I LIKE THORNFIELD ITS
ANTIQUITY ITS RETIREMENT ITS OLD CROW TREES AND THORN TREES ITS GREY
FACADE AND LINES OF DARK WINDOWS REFLECTING THAT METAL WELKIN AND YET
HOW LONG HAVE I ABHORRED THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT SHUNNED IT LIKE A GREAT
PLAGUE HOUSE HOW I DO STILL ABHOR
HE GROUND HIS TEETH AND WAS SILENT HE ARRESTED HIS STEP AND STRUCK HIS
BOOT AGAINST THE HARD GROUND
SOME HATED THOUGHT SEEMED TO HAVE HIM IN
ITS GRIP AND TO HOLD HIM SO TIGHTLY THAT HE COULD NOT ADVANCE
WE WERE ASCENDING THE AVENUE WHEN HE THUS PAUSED THE HALL WAS BEFORE US
LIFTING HIS EYE TO ITS BATTLEMENTS HE CAST OVER THEM A GLARE SUCH AS I
NEVER SAW BEFORE OR SINCE
PAIN SHAME IRE IMPATIENCE DISGUST
DETESTATION SEEMED MOMENTARILY TO HOLD A QUIVERING CONFLICT IN THE LARGE
PUPIL DILATING UNDER HIS EBON EYEBROW
WILD WAS THE WRESTLE WHICH SHOULD
BE PARAMOUNT BUT ANOTHER FEELING ROSE AND TRIUMPHED SOMETHING HARD AND
CYNICAL SELF WILLED AND RESOLUTE IT SETTLED HIS PASSION AND PETRIFIED
HIS COUNTENANCE HE WENT ON
DURING THE MOMENT I WAS SILENT MISS EYRE I WAS ARRANGING A POINT WITH
MY DESTINY
SHE STOOD THERE BY THAT BEECH TRUNK A HAG LIKE ONE OF
THOSE WHO APPEARED TO MACBETH ON THE HEATH OF FORRES
'YOU LIKE
THORNFIELD SHE SAID LIFTING HER FINGER AND THEN SHE WROTE IN THE AIR
A MEMENTO WHICH RAN IN LURID HIEROGLYPHICS ALL ALONG THE HOUSE FRONT
BETWEEN THE UPPER AND LOWER ROW OF WINDOWS 'LIKE IT IF YOU CAN LIKE IT
IF YOU DARE
'I WILL LIKE IT SAID I 'I DARE LIKE IT AND HE SUBJOINED MOODILY
I WILL KEEP MY WORD I WILL BREAK OBSTACLES TO HAPPINESS TO
GOODNESS YES GOODNESS
I WISH TO BE A BETTER MAN THAN I HAVE BEEN
THAN I AM AS JOB'S LEVIATHAN BROKE THE SPEAR THE DART AND THE
HABERGEON HINDRANCES WHICH OTHERS COUNT AS IRON AND BRASS I WILL ESTEEM
BUT STRAW AND ROTTEN WOOD
ADELE HERE RAN BEFORE HIM WITH HER SHUTTLECOCK
AWAY HE CRIED
HARSHLY KEEP AT A DISTANCE CHILD OR GO IN TO SOPHIE CONTINUING
THEN TO PURSUE HIS WALK IN SILENCE I VENTURED TO RECALL HIM TO THE POINT
WHENCE HE HAD ABRUPTLY DIVERGED
DID YOU LEAVE THE BALCONY SIR I ASKED WHEN MDLLE
VARENS ENTERED
I ALMOST EXPECTED A REBUFF FOR THIS HARDLY WELL TIMED QUESTION BUT ON
THE CONTRARY WAKING OUT OF HIS SCOWLING ABSTRACTION HE TURNED HIS EYES
TOWARDS ME AND THE SHADE SEEMED TO CLEAR OFF HIS BROW
OH I HAD
FORGOTTEN CELINE WELL TO RESUME
WHEN I SAW MY CHARMER THUS COME IN
ACCOMPANIED BY A CAVALIER I SEEMED TO HEAR A HISS AND THE GREEN SNAKE
OF JEALOUSY RISING ON UNDULATING COILS FROM THE MOONLIT BALCONY GLIDED
WITHIN MY WAISTCOAT AND ATE ITS WAY IN TWO MINUTES TO MY HEART'S CORE
STRANGE HE EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY STARTING AGAIN FROM THE POINT
STRANGE
THAT I SHOULD CHOOSE YOU FOR THE CONFIDANT OF ALL THIS YOUNG LADY
PASSING STRANGE THAT YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO ME QUIETLY AS IF IT WERE THE
MOST USUAL THING IN THE WORLD FOR A MAN LIKE ME TO TELL STORIES OF HIS
OPERA MISTRESSES TO A QUAINT INEXPERIENCED GIRL LIKE YOU BUT THE LAST
SINGULARITY EXPLAINS THE FIRST AS I INTIMATED ONCE BEFORE YOU WITH
YOUR GRAVITY CONSIDERATENESS AND CAUTION WERE MADE TO BE THE RECIPIENT
OF SECRETS
BESIDES I KNOW WHAT SORT OF A MIND I HAVE PLACED IN
COMMUNICATION WITH MY OWN I KNOW IT IS ONE NOT LIABLE TO TAKE INFECTION
IT IS A PECULIAR MIND IT IS A UNIQUE ONE
HAPPILY I DO NOT MEAN TO HARM
IT BUT IF I DID IT WOULD NOT TAKE HARM FROM ME
THE MORE YOU AND I
CONVERSE THE BETTER FOR WHILE I CANNOT BLIGHT YOU YOU MAY REFRESH ME
AFTER THIS DIGRESSION HE PROCEEDED
I REMAINED IN THE BALCONY
'THEY WILL COME TO HER BOUDOIR NO DOUBT
THOUGHT I 'LET ME PREPARE AN AMBUSH SO PUTTING MY HAND IN THROUGH THE
OPEN WINDOW I DREW THE CURTAIN OVER IT LEAVING ONLY AN OPENING THROUGH
WHICH I COULD TAKE OBSERVATIONS THEN I CLOSED THE CASEMENT ALL BUT A
CHINK JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO FURNISH AN OUTLET TO LOVERS' WHISPERED VOWS
THEN I STOLE BACK TO MY CHAIR AND AS I RESUMED IT THE PAIR CAME IN
MY
EYE WAS QUICKLY AT THE APERTURE
CELINE'S CHAMBER MAID ENTERED LIT A
LAMP LEFT IT ON THE TABLE AND WITHDREW
THE COUPLE WERE THUS REVEALED
TO ME CLEARLY BOTH REMOVED THEIR CLOAKS AND THERE WAS 'THE VARENS
SHINING IN SATIN AND JEWELS MY GIFTS OF COURSE AND THERE WAS HER
COMPANION IN AN OFFICER'S UNIFORM AND I KNEW HIM FOR A YOUNG ROUE OF A
VICOMTE A BRAINLESS AND VICIOUS YOUTH WHOM I HAD SOMETIMES MET IN
SOCIETY AND HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HATING BECAUSE I DESPISED HIM SO
ABSOLUTELY
ON RECOGNISING HIM THE FANG OF THE SNAKE JEALOUSY WAS
INSTANTLY BROKEN BECAUSE AT THE SAME MOMENT MY LOVE FOR CELINE SANK
UNDER AN EXTINGUISHER
A WOMAN WHO COULD BETRAY ME FOR SUCH A RIVAL WAS
NOT WORTH CONTENDING FOR SHE DESERVED ONLY SCORN LESS HOWEVER THAN I
WHO HAD BEEN HER DUPE
THEY BEGAN TO TALK THEIR CONVERSATION EASED ME COMPLETELY FRIVOLOUS
MERCENARY HEARTLESS AND SENSELESS IT WAS RATHER CALCULATED TO WEARY
THAN ENRAGE A LISTENER
A CARD OF MINE LAY ON THE TABLE THIS BEING
PERCEIVED BROUGHT MY NAME UNDER DISCUSSION
NEITHER OF THEM POSSESSED
ENERGY OR WIT TO BELABOUR ME SOUNDLY BUT THEY INSULTED ME AS COARSELY AS
THEY COULD IN THEIR LITTLE WAY ESPECIALLY CELINE WHO EVEN WAXED RATHER
BRILLIANT ON MY PERSONAL DEFECTS DEFORMITIES SHE TERMED THEM
NOW IT
HAD BEEN HER CUSTOM TO LAUNCH OUT INTO FERVENT ADMIRATION OF WHAT SHE
CALLED MY BEAUTE MALE WHEREIN SHE DIFFERED DIAMETRICALLY FROM YOU
WHO TOLD ME POINT BLANK AT THE SECOND INTERVIEW THAT YOU DID NOT THINK
ME HANDSOME
THE CONTRAST STRUCK ME AT THE TIME AND
ADELE HERE CAME RUNNING UP AGAIN
MONSIEUR JOHN HAS JUST BEEN TO SAY THAT YOUR AGENT HAS CALLED AND
WISHES TO SEE YOU
AH IN THAT CASE I MUST ABRIDGE
OPENING THE WINDOW I WALKED IN UPON
THEM LIBERATED CELINE FROM MY PROTECTION GAVE HER NOTICE TO VACATE HER
HOTEL OFFERED HER A PURSE FOR IMMEDIATE EXIGENCIES DISREGARDED SCREAMS
HYSTERICS PRAYERS PROTESTATIONS CONVULSIONS MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH
THE VICOMTE FOR A MEETING AT THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE
NEXT MORNING I HAD
THE PLEASURE OF ENCOUNTERING HIM LEFT A BULLET IN ONE OF HIS POOR
ETIOLATED ARMS FEEBLE AS THE WING OF A CHICKEN IN THE PIP AND THEN
THOUGHT I HAD DONE WITH THE WHOLE CREW
BUT UNLUCKILY THE VARENS SIX
MONTHS BEFORE HAD GIVEN ME THIS FILETTE ADELE WHO SHE AFFIRMED WAS MY
DAUGHTER AND PERHAPS SHE MAY BE THOUGH I SEE NO PROOFS OF SUCH GRIM
PATERNITY WRITTEN IN HER COUNTENANCE PILOT IS MORE LIKE ME THAN SHE
SOME YEARS AFTER I HAD BROKEN WITH THE MOTHER SHE ABANDONED HER CHILD
AND RAN AWAY TO ITALY WITH A MUSICIAN OR SINGER
I ACKNOWLEDGED NO
NATURAL CLAIM ON ADELE'S PART TO BE SUPPORTED BY ME NOR DO I NOW
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY FOR I AM NOT HER FATHER BUT HEARING THAT SHE WAS QUITE
DESTITUTE I E'EN TOOK THE POOR THING OUT OF THE SLIME AND MUD OF PARIS
AND TRANSPLANTED IT HERE TO GROW UP CLEAN IN THE WHOLESOME SOIL OF AN
ENGLISH COUNTRY GARDEN
MRS
FAIRFAX FOUND YOU TO TRAIN IT BUT NOW YOU
KNOW THAT IT IS THE ILLEGITIMATE OFFSPRING OF A FRENCH OPERA GIRL YOU
WILL PERHAPS THINK DIFFERENTLY OF YOUR POST AND PROTEGEE YOU WILL BE
COMING TO ME SOME DAY WITH NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE FOUND ANOTHER PLACE THAT
YOU BEG ME TO LOOK OUT FOR A NEW GOVERNESS C EH
NO ADELE IS NOT ANSWERABLE FOR EITHER HER MOTHER'S FAULTS OR YOURS I
HAVE A REGARD FOR HER AND NOW THAT I KNOW SHE IS IN A SENSE
PARENTLESS FORSAKEN BY HER MOTHER AND DISOWNED BY YOU SIR I SHALL
CLING CLOSER TO HER THAN BEFORE
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY PREFER THE SPOILT
PET OF A WEALTHY FAMILY WHO WOULD HATE HER GOVERNESS AS A NUISANCE TO A
LONELY LITTLE ORPHAN WHO LEANS TOWARDS HER AS A FRIEND
OH THAT IS THE LIGHT IN WHICH YOU VIEW IT WELL I MUST GO IN NOW AND
YOU TOO IT DARKENS
BUT I STAYED OUT A FEW MINUTES LONGER WITH ADELE AND PILOT RAN A RACE
WITH HER AND PLAYED A GAME OF BATTLEDORE AND SHUTTLECOCK
WHEN WE WENT
IN AND I HAD REMOVED HER BONNET AND COAT I TOOK HER ON MY KNEE KEPT
HER THERE AN HOUR ALLOWING HER TO PRATTLE AS SHE LIKED NOT REBUKING
EVEN SOME LITTLE FREEDOMS AND TRIVIALITIES INTO WHICH SHE WAS APT TO
STRAY WHEN MUCH NOTICED AND WHICH BETRAYED IN HER A SUPERFICIALITY OF
CHARACTER INHERITED PROBABLY FROM HER MOTHER HARDLY CONGENIAL TO AN
ENGLISH MIND
STILL SHE HAD HER MERITS AND I WAS DISPOSED TO APPRECIATE
ALL THAT WAS GOOD IN HER TO THE UTMOST
I SOUGHT IN HER COUNTENANCE AND
FEATURES A LIKENESS TO MR
ROCHESTER BUT FOUND NONE NO TRAIT NO TURN
OF EXPRESSION ANNOUNCED RELATIONSHIP
IT WAS A PITY IF SHE COULD BUT
HAVE BEEN PROVED TO RESEMBLE HIM HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MORE OF HER
IT WAS NOT TILL AFTER I HAD WITHDRAWN TO MY OWN CHAMBER FOR THE NIGHT
THAT I STEADILY REVIEWED THE TALE MR
ROCHESTER HAD TOLD ME
AS HE HAD
SAID THERE WAS PROBABLY NOTHING AT ALL EXTRAORDINARY IN THE SUBSTANCE OF
THE NARRATIVE ITSELF A WEALTHY ENGLISHMAN'S PASSION FOR A FRENCH DANCER
AND HER TREACHERY TO HIM WERE EVERY DAY MATTERS ENOUGH NO DOUBT IN
SOCIETY BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING DECIDEDLY STRANGE IN THE PAROXYSM OF
EMOTION WHICH HAD SUDDENLY SEIZED HIM WHEN HE WAS IN THE ACT OF
EXPRESSING THE PRESENT CONTENTMENT OF HIS MOOD AND HIS NEWLY REVIVED
PLEASURE IN THE OLD HALL AND ITS ENVIRONS
I MEDITATED WONDERINGLY ON
THIS INCIDENT BUT GRADUALLY QUITTING IT AS I FOUND IT FOR THE PRESENT
INEXPLICABLE I TURNED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF MY MASTER'S MANNER TO
MYSELF
THE CONFIDENCE HE HAD THOUGHT FIT TO REPOSE IN ME SEEMED A
TRIBUTE TO MY DISCRETION I REGARDED AND ACCEPTED IT AS SUCH
HIS
DEPORTMENT HAD NOW FOR SOME WEEKS BEEN MORE UNIFORM TOWARDS ME THAN AT
THE FIRST
I NEVER SEEMED IN HIS WAY HE DID NOT TAKE FITS OF CHILLING
HAUTEUR WHEN HE MET ME UNEXPECTEDLY THE ENCOUNTER SEEMED WELCOME HE
HAD ALWAYS A WORD AND SOMETIMES A SMILE FOR ME WHEN SUMMONED BY FORMAL
INVITATION TO HIS PRESENCE I WAS HONOURED BY A CORDIALITY OF RECEPTION
THAT MADE ME FEEL I REALLY POSSESSED THE POWER TO AMUSE HIM AND THAT
THESE EVENING CONFERENCES WERE SOUGHT AS MUCH FOR HIS PLEASURE AS FOR MY
BENEFIT
I INDEED TALKED COMPARATIVELY LITTLE BUT I HEARD HIM TALK WITH RELISH
IT WAS HIS NATURE TO BE COMMUNICATIVE HE LIKED TO OPEN TO A MIND
UNACQUAINTED WITH THE WORLD GLIMPSES OF ITS SCENES AND WAYS I DO NOT
MEAN ITS CORRUPT SCENES AND WICKED WAYS BUT SUCH AS DERIVED THEIR
INTEREST FROM THE GREAT SCALE ON WHICH THEY WERE ACTED THE STRANGE
NOVELTY BY WHICH THEY WERE CHARACTERISED AND I HAD A KEEN DELIGHT IN
RECEIVING THE NEW IDEAS HE OFFERED IN IMAGINING THE NEW PICTURES HE
PORTRAYED AND FOLLOWING HIM IN THOUGHT THROUGH THE NEW REGIONS HE
DISCLOSED NEVER STARTLED OR TROUBLED BY ONE NOXIOUS ALLUSION
THE EASE OF HIS MANNER FREED ME FROM PAINFUL RESTRAINT THE FRIENDLY
FRANKNESS AS CORRECT AS CORDIAL WITH WHICH HE TREATED ME DREW ME TO
HIM
I FELT AT TIMES AS IF HE WERE MY RELATION RATHER THAN MY MASTER
YET HE WAS IMPERIOUS SOMETIMES STILL BUT I DID NOT MIND THAT I SAW IT
WAS HIS WAY
SO HAPPY SO GRATIFIED DID I BECOME WITH THIS NEW INTEREST
ADDED TO LIFE THAT I CEASED TO PINE AFTER KINDRED MY THIN
CRESCENT DESTINY SEEMED TO ENLARGE THE BLANKS OF EXISTENCE WERE FILLED
UP MY BODILY HEALTH IMPROVED I GATHERED FLESH AND STRENGTH
AND WAS MR
ROCHESTER NOW UGLY IN MY EYES NO READER GRATITUDE AND
MANY ASSOCIATIONS ALL PLEASURABLE AND GENIAL MADE HIS FACE THE OBJECT I
BEST LIKED TO SEE HIS PRESENCE IN A ROOM WAS MORE CHEERING THAN THE
BRIGHTEST FIRE
YET I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIS FAULTS INDEED I COULD NOT
FOR HE BROUGHT THEM FREQUENTLY BEFORE ME
HE WAS PROUD SARDONIC HARSH
TO INFERIORITY OF EVERY DESCRIPTION IN MY SECRET SOUL I KNEW THAT HIS
GREAT KINDNESS TO ME WAS BALANCED BY UNJUST SEVERITY TO MANY OTHERS
HE
WAS MOODY TOO UNACCOUNTABLY SO I MORE THAN ONCE WHEN SENT FOR TO READ
TO HIM FOUND HIM SITTING IN HIS LIBRARY ALONE WITH HIS HEAD BENT ON HIS
FOLDED ARMS AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP A MOROSE ALMOST A MALIGNANT SCOWL
BLACKENED HIS FEATURES
BUT I BELIEVED THAT HIS MOODINESS HIS
HARSHNESS AND HIS FORMER FAULTS OF MORALITY I SAY FORMER FOR NOW HE
SEEMED CORRECTED OF THEM HAD THEIR SOURCE IN SOME CRUEL CROSS OF FATE
I
BELIEVED HE WAS NATURALLY A MAN OF BETTER TENDENCIES HIGHER PRINCIPLES
AND PURER TASTES THAN SUCH AS CIRCUMSTANCES HAD DEVELOPED EDUCATION
INSTILLED OR DESTINY ENCOURAGED
I THOUGHT THERE WERE EXCELLENT
MATERIALS IN HIM THOUGH FOR THE PRESENT THEY HUNG TOGETHER SOMEWHAT
SPOILED AND TANGLED
I CANNOT DENY THAT I GRIEVED FOR HIS GRIEF
WHATEVER THAT WAS AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO ASSUAGE IT
THOUGH I HAD NOW EXTINGUISHED MY CANDLE AND WAS LAID DOWN IN BED I COULD
NOT SLEEP FOR THINKING OF HIS LOOK WHEN HE PAUSED IN THE AVENUE AND TOLD
HOW HIS DESTINY HAD RISEN UP BEFORE HIM AND DARED HIM TO BE HAPPY AT
THORNFIELD
WHY NOT I ASKED MYSELF
WHAT ALIENATES HIM FROM THE HOUSE WILL HE
LEAVE IT AGAIN SOON MRS
FAIRFAX SAID HE SELDOM STAYED HERE LONGER THAN
A FORTNIGHT AT A TIME AND HE HAS NOW BEEN RESIDENT EIGHT WEEKS
IF HE
DOES GO THE CHANGE WILL BE DOLEFUL
SUPPOSE HE SHOULD BE ABSENT SPRING
SUMMER AND AUTUMN HOW JOYLESS SUNSHINE AND FINE DAYS WILL SEEM
I HARDLY KNOW WHETHER I HAD SLEPT OR NOT AFTER THIS MUSING AT ANY RATE
I STARTED WIDE AWAKE ON HEARING A VAGUE MURMUR PECULIAR AND LUGUBRIOUS
WHICH SOUNDED I THOUGHT JUST ABOVE ME
I WISHED I HAD KEPT MY CANDLE
BURNING THE NIGHT WAS DREARILY DARK MY SPIRITS WERE DEPRESSED
I ROSE
AND SAT UP IN BED LISTENING
THE SOUND WAS HUSHED
I TRIED AGAIN TO SLEEP BUT MY HEART BEAT ANXIOUSLY MY INWARD
TRANQUILLITY WAS BROKEN
THE CLOCK FAR DOWN IN THE HALL STRUCK TWO
JUST THEN IT SEEMED MY CHAMBER DOOR WAS TOUCHED AS IF FINGERS HAD SWEPT
THE PANELS IN GROPING A WAY ALONG THE DARK GALLERY OUTSIDE
I SAID WHO
IS THERE NOTHING ANSWERED
I WAS CHILLED WITH FEAR
ALL AT ONCE I REMEMBERED THAT IT MIGHT BE PILOT WHO WHEN THE KITCHEN
DOOR CHANCED TO BE LEFT OPEN NOT UNFREQUENTLY FOUND HIS WAY UP TO THE
THRESHOLD OF MR
ROCHESTER'S CHAMBER I HAD SEEN HIM LYING THERE MYSELF
IN THE MORNINGS
THE IDEA CALMED ME SOMEWHAT I LAY DOWN
SILENCE
COMPOSES THE NERVES AND AS AN UNBROKEN HUSH NOW REIGNED AGAIN THROUGH
THE WHOLE HOUSE I BEGAN TO FEEL THE RETURN OF SLUMBER
BUT IT WAS NOT
FATED THAT I SHOULD SLEEP THAT NIGHT
A DREAM HAD SCARCELY APPROACHED MY
EAR WHEN IT FLED AFFRIGHTED SCARED BY A MARROW FREEZING INCIDENT
ENOUGH
THIS WAS A DEMONIAC LAUGH LOW SUPPRESSED AND DEEP UTTERED AS IT
SEEMED AT THE VERY KEYHOLE OF MY CHAMBER DOOR
THE HEAD OF MY BED WAS
NEAR THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT AT FIRST THE GOBLIN LAUGHER STOOD AT MY
BEDSIDE OR RATHER CROUCHED BY MY PILLOW BUT I ROSE LOOKED ROUND AND
COULD SEE NOTHING WHILE AS I STILL GAZED THE UNNATURAL SOUND WAS
REITERATED AND I KNEW IT CAME FROM BEHIND THE PANELS
MY FIRST IMPULSE
WAS TO RISE AND FASTEN THE BOLT MY NEXT AGAIN TO CRY OUT WHO IS
THERE
SOMETHING GURGLED AND MOANED
ERE LONG STEPS RETREATED UP THE GALLERY
TOWARDS THE THIRD STOREY STAIRCASE A DOOR HAD LATELY BEEN MADE TO SHUT
IN THAT STAIRCASE I HEARD IT OPEN AND CLOSE AND ALL WAS STILL
WAS THAT GRACE POOLE AND IS SHE POSSESSED WITH A DEVIL THOUGHT I
IMPOSSIBLE NOW TO REMAIN LONGER BY MYSELF I MUST GO TO MRS
FAIRFAX
I
HURRIED ON MY FROCK AND A SHAWL I WITHDREW THE BOLT AND OPENED THE DOOR
WITH A TREMBLING HAND
THERE WAS A CANDLE BURNING JUST OUTSIDE AND ON
THE MATTING IN THE GALLERY
I WAS SURPRISED AT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE BUT
STILL MORE WAS I AMAZED TO PERCEIVE THE AIR QUITE DIM AS IF FILLED WITH
SMOKE AND WHILE LOOKING TO THE RIGHT HAND AND LEFT TO FIND WHENCE
THESE BLUE WREATHS ISSUED I BECAME FURTHER AWARE OF A STRONG SMELL OF
BURNING
SOMETHING CREAKED IT WAS A DOOR AJAR AND THAT DOOR WAS MR
ROCHESTER'S
AND THE SMOKE RUSHED IN A CLOUD FROM THENCE
I THOUGHT NO MORE OF MRS
FAIRFAX I THOUGHT NO MORE OF GRACE POOLE OR THE LAUGH IN AN INSTANT I
WAS WITHIN THE CHAMBER
TONGUES OF FLAME DARTED ROUND THE BED THE
CURTAINS WERE ON FIRE
IN THE MIDST OF BLAZE AND VAPOUR MR
ROCHESTER
LAY STRETCHED MOTIONLESS IN DEEP SLEEP
WAKE WAKE I CRIED
I SHOOK HIM BUT HE ONLY MURMURED AND TURNED THE
SMOKE HAD STUPEFIED HIM
NOT A MOMENT COULD BE LOST THE VERY SHEETS
WERE KINDLING I RUSHED TO HIS BASIN AND EWER FORTUNATELY ONE WAS WIDE
AND THE OTHER DEEP AND BOTH WERE FILLED WITH WATER
I HEAVED THEM UP
DELUGED THE BED AND ITS OCCUPANT FLEW BACK TO MY OWN ROOM BROUGHT MY
OWN WATER JUG BAPTIZED THE COUCH AFRESH AND BY GOD'S AID SUCCEEDED IN
EXTINGUISHING THE FLAMES WHICH WERE DEVOURING IT
THE HISS OF THE QUENCHED ELEMENT THE BREAKAGE OF A PITCHER WHICH I FLUNG
FROM MY HAND WHEN I HAD EMPTIED IT AND ABOVE ALL THE SPLASH OF THE
SHOWER BATH I HAD LIBERALLY BESTOWED ROUSED MR
ROCHESTER AT LAST
THOUGH IT WAS NOW DARK I KNEW HE WAS AWAKE BECAUSE I HEARD HIM
FULMINATING STRANGE ANATHEMAS AT FINDING HIMSELF LYING IN A POOL OF
WATER
IS THERE A FLOOD HE CRIED
NO SIR I ANSWERED BUT THERE HAS BEEN A FIRE GET UP DO YOU ARE
QUENCHED NOW I WILL FETCH YOU A CANDLE
IN THE NAME OF ALL THE ELVES IN CHRISTENDOM IS THAT JANE EYRE HE
DEMANDED
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH ME WITCH SORCERESS WHO IS IN THE
ROOM BESIDES YOU HAVE YOU PLOTTED TO DROWN ME
I WILL FETCH YOU A CANDLE SIR AND IN HEAVEN'S NAME GET UP

HAS PLOTTED SOMETHING YOU CANNOT TOO SOON FIND OUT WHO AND WHAT IT IS
THERE I AM UP NOW BUT AT YOUR PERIL YOU FETCH A CANDLE YET WAIT TWO
MINUTES TILL I GET INTO SOME DRY GARMENTS IF ANY DRY THERE BE YES HERE

NOW RUN
I DID RUN I BROUGHT THE CANDLE WHICH STILL REMAINED IN THE GALLERY
HE
TOOK IT FROM MY HAND HELD IT UP AND SURVEYED THE BED ALL BLACKENED AND
SCORCHED THE SHEETS DRENCHED THE CARPET ROUND SWIMMING IN WATER
WHAT IS IT AND WHO DID IT HE ASKED
I BRIEFLY RELATED TO HIM WHAT
HAD TRANSPIRED THE STRANGE LAUGH I HAD HEARD IN THE GALLERY THE STEP
ASCENDING TO THE THIRD STOREY THE SMOKE THE SMELL OF FIRE WHICH HAD
CONDUCTED ME TO HIS ROOM IN WHAT STATE I HAD FOUND MATTERS THERE AND
HOW I HAD DELUGED HIM WITH ALL THE WATER I COULD LAY HANDS ON
WHAT IS IT AND WHO DID IT HE ASKED P140 JPG
HE LISTENED VERY GRAVELY HIS FACE AS I WENT ON EXPRESSED MORE CONCERN
THAN ASTONISHMENT HE DID NOT IMMEDIATELY SPEAK WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED
SHALL I CALL MRS
FAIRFAX I ASKED
MRS
FAIRFAX NO WHAT THE DEUCE WOULD YOU CALL HER FOR WHAT CAN SHE
DO LET HER SLEEP UNMOLESTED
THEN I WILL FETCH LEAH AND WAKE JOHN AND HIS WIFE

THE ARM CHAIR THERE I WILL PUT IT ON

STOOL TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE WET
I AM GOING TO LEAVE YOU A FEW
MINUTES
I SHALL TAKE THE CANDLE
REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE TILL I RETURN
BE AS STILL AS A MOUSE
I MUST PAY A VISIT TO THE SECOND STOREY
DON'T
MOVE REMEMBER OR CALL ANY ONE
HE WENT I WATCHED THE LIGHT WITHDRAW
HE PASSED UP THE GALLERY VERY
SOFTLY UNCLOSED THE STAIRCASE DOOR WITH AS LITTLE NOISE AS POSSIBLE
SHUT IT AFTER HIM AND THE LAST RAY VANISHED
I WAS LEFT IN TOTAL
DARKNESS
I LISTENED FOR SOME NOISE BUT HEARD NOTHING
A VERY LONG
TIME ELAPSED
I GREW WEARY IT WAS COLD IN SPITE OF THE CLOAK AND THEN
I DID NOT SEE THE USE OF STAYING AS I WAS NOT TO ROUSE THE HOUSE
I WAS
ON THE POINT OF RISKING MR
ROCHESTER'S DISPLEASURE BY DISOBEYING HIS
ORDERS WHEN THE LIGHT ONCE MORE GLEAMED DIMLY ON THE GALLERY WALL AND I
HEARD HIS UNSHOD FEET TREAD THE MATTING
I HOPE IT IS HE THOUGHT I
AND NOT SOMETHING WORSE
HE RE ENTERED PALE AND VERY GLOOMY
I HAVE FOUND IT ALL OUT SAID HE
SETTING HIS CANDLE DOWN ON THE WASHSTAND IT IS AS I THOUGHT
HOW SIR
HE MADE NO REPLY BUT STOOD WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED LOOKING ON THE GROUND
AT THE END OF A FEW MINUTES HE INQUIRED IN RATHER A PECULIAR TONE
I FORGET WHETHER YOU SAID YOU SAW ANYTHING WHEN YOU OPENED YOUR CHAMBER
DOOR
NO SIR ONLY THE CANDLESTICK ON THE GROUND
BUT YOU HEARD AN ODD LAUGH YOU HAVE HEARD THAT LAUGH BEFORE I SHOULD
THINK OR SOMETHING LIKE IT
YES SIR THERE IS A WOMAN WHO SEWS HERE CALLED GRACE POOLE SHE
LAUGHS IN THAT WAY

BUT NOT WITHOUT TAKING LEAVE NOT WITHOUT A WORD OR TWO OF
ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND GOOD WILL NOT IN SHORT IN THAT BRIEF DRY FASHION
WHY YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SNATCHED ME FROM A HORRIBLE AND
EXCRUCIATING DEATH AND YOU WALK PAST ME AS IF WE WERE MUTUAL STRANGERS

BOTH HIS OWN

DEBT

TOLERABLE TO ME IN THE CHARACTER OF CREDITOR FOR SUCH AN OBLIGATION BUT

HIS VOICE WAS CHECKED
GOOD NIGHT AGAIN SIR

IN THE CASE
I KNEW HE CONTINUED YOU WOULD DO ME GOOD IN SOME WAY AT SOME
TIME I SAW IT IN YOUR EYES WHEN I FIRST BEHELD YOU THEIR EXPRESSION
AND SMILE DID NOT AGAIN HE STOPPED DID NOT HE PROCEEDED HASTILY
STRIKE DELIGHT TO MY VERY INMOST HEART SO FOR NOTHING
PEOPLE TALK OF
NATURAL SYMPATHIES I HAVE HEARD OF GOOD GENII THERE ARE GRAINS OF TRUTH

RETAINED MY HAND AND I COULD NOT FREE IT
I BETHOUGHT MYSELF OF AN
EXPEDIENT
I THINK I HEAR MRS
FAIRFAX MOVE SIR SAID I
WELL LEAVE ME HE RELAXED HIS FINGERS AND I WAS GONE
I REGAINED MY COUCH BUT NEVER THOUGHT OF SLEEP
TILL MORNING DAWNED I
WAS TOSSED ON A BUOYANT BUT UNQUIET SEA WHERE BILLOWS OF TROUBLE ROLLED
UNDER SURGES OF JOY
I THOUGHT SOMETIMES I SAW BEYOND ITS WILD WATERS A
SHORE SWEET AS THE HILLS OF BEULAH AND NOW AND THEN A FRESHENING GALE
WAKENED BY HOPE BORE MY SPIRIT TRIUMPHANTLY TOWARDS THE BOURNE BUT I
COULD NOT REACH IT EVEN IN FANCY A COUNTERACTING BREEZE BLEW OFF LAND
AND CONTINUALLY DROVE ME BACK
SENSE WOULD RESIST DELIRIUM JUDGMENT
WOULD WARN PASSION
TOO FEVERISH TO REST I ROSE AS SOON AS DAY DAWNED
CHAPTER XVI
I BOTH WISHED AND FEARED TO SEE MR
ROCHESTER ON THE DAY WHICH FOLLOWED
THIS SLEEPLESS NIGHT I WANTED TO HEAR HIS VOICE AGAIN YET FEARED TO
MEET HIS EYE
DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE MORNING I MOMENTARILY
EXPECTED HIS COMING HE WAS NOT IN THE FREQUENT HABIT OF ENTERING THE
SCHOOLROOM BUT HE DID STEP IN FOR A FEW MINUTES SOMETIMES AND I HAD THE
IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS SURE TO VISIT IT THAT DAY
BUT THE MORNING PASSED JUST AS USUAL NOTHING HAPPENED TO INTERRUPT THE
QUIET COURSE OF ADELE'S STUDIES ONLY SOON AFTER BREAKFAST I HEARD SOME
BUSTLE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MR
ROCHESTER'S CHAMBER MRS
FAIRFAX'S
VOICE AND LEAH'S AND THE COOK'S THAT IS JOHN'S WIFE AND EVEN JOHN'S
OWN GRUFF TONES
THERE WERE EXCLAMATIONS OF WHAT A MERCY MASTER WAS NOT
BURNT IN HIS BED IT IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS TO KEEP A CANDLE LIT AT
NIGHT HOW PROVIDENTIAL THAT HE HAD PRESENCE OF MIND TO THINK OF THE
WATER JUG I WONDER HE WAKED NOBODY IT IS TO BE HOPED HE WILL NOT
TAKE COLD WITH SLEEPING ON THE LIBRARY SOFA C
TO MUCH CONFABULATION SUCCEEDED A SOUND OF SCRUBBING AND SETTING TO
RIGHTS AND WHEN I PASSED THE ROOM IN GOING DOWNSTAIRS TO DINNER I SAW
THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR THAT ALL WAS AGAIN RESTORED TO COMPLETE ORDER ONLY
THE BED WAS STRIPPED OF ITS HANGINGS
LEAH STOOD UP IN THE WINDOW SEAT
RUBBING THE PANES OF GLASS DIMMED WITH SMOKE
I WAS ABOUT TO ADDRESS
HER FOR I WISHED TO KNOW WHAT ACCOUNT HAD BEEN GIVEN OF THE AFFAIR BUT
ON ADVANCING I SAW A SECOND PERSON IN THE CHAMBER A WOMAN SITTING ON A
CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE AND SEWING RINGS TO NEW CURTAINS
THAT WOMAN WAS
NO OTHER THAN GRACE POOLE
THERE SHE SAT STAID AND TACITURN LOOKING AS USUAL IN HER BROWN STUFF
GOWN HER CHECK APRON WHITE HANDKERCHIEF AND CAP
SHE WAS INTENT ON
HER WORK IN WHICH HER WHOLE THOUGHTS SEEMED ABSORBED ON HER HARD
FOREHEAD AND IN HER COMMONPLACE FEATURES WAS NOTHING EITHER OF THE
PALENESS OR DESPERATION ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE MARKING THE
COUNTENANCE OF A WOMAN WHO HAD ATTEMPTED MURDER AND WHOSE INTENDED
VICTIM HAD FOLLOWED HER LAST NIGHT TO HER LAIR AND AS I BELIEVED
CHARGED HER WITH THE CRIME SHE WISHED TO PERPETRATE
I WAS
AMAZED CONFOUNDED
SHE LOOKED UP WHILE I STILL GAZED AT HER NO START
NO INCREASE OR FAILURE OF COLOUR BETRAYED EMOTION CONSCIOUSNESS OF
GUILT OR FEAR OF DETECTION
SHE SAID GOOD MORNING MISS IN HER USUAL
PHLEGMATIC AND BRIEF MANNER AND TAKING UP ANOTHER RING AND MORE TAPE
WENT ON WITH HER SEWING
I WILL PUT HER TO SOME TEST THOUGHT I SUCH ABSOLUTE IMPENETRABILITY
IS PAST COMPREHENSION
GOOD MORNING GRACE I SAID
HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED HERE I THOUGHT I
HEARD THE SERVANTS ALL TALKING TOGETHER A WHILE AGO
ONLY MASTER HAD BEEN READING IN HIS BED LAST NIGHT HE FELL ASLEEP WITH
HIS CANDLE LIT AND THE CURTAINS GOT ON FIRE BUT FORTUNATELY HE AWOKE
BEFORE THE BED CLOTHES OR THE WOOD WORK CAUGHT AND CONTRIVED TO QUENCH
THE FLAMES WITH THE WATER IN THE EWER
A STRANGE AFFAIR I SAID IN A LOW VOICE THEN LOOKING AT HER
FIXEDLY DID MR
ROCHESTER WAKE NOBODY DID NO ONE HEAR HIM MOVE
SHE AGAIN RAISED HER EYES TO ME AND THIS TIME THERE WAS SOMETHING OF
CONSCIOUSNESS IN THEIR EXPRESSION
SHE SEEMED TO EXAMINE ME WARILY THEN
SHE ANSWERED
THE SERVANTS SLEEP SO FAR OFF YOU KNOW MISS THEY WOULD NOT BE LIKELY
TO HEAR
MRS
FAIRFAX'S ROOM AND YOURS ARE THE NEAREST TO MASTER'S BUT
MRS
FAIRFAX SAID SHE HEARD NOTHING WHEN PEOPLE GET ELDERLY THEY OFTEN
SLEEP HEAVY SHE PAUSED AND THEN ADDED WITH A SORT OF ASSUMED
INDIFFERENCE BUT STILL IN A MARKED AND SIGNIFICANT TONE BUT YOU ARE
YOUNG MISS AND I SHOULD SAY A LIGHT SLEEPER PERHAPS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD
A NOISE
I DID SAID I DROPPING MY VOICE SO THAT LEAH WHO WAS STILL POLISHING
THE PANES COULD NOT HEAR ME AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS PILOT BUT
PILOT CANNOT LAUGH AND I AM CERTAIN I HEARD A LAUGH AND A STRANGE ONE
SHE TOOK A NEW NEEDLEFUL OF THREAD WAXED IT CAREFULLY THREADED HER
NEEDLE WITH A STEADY HAND AND THEN OBSERVED WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE
IT IS HARDLY LIKELY MASTER WOULD LAUGH I SHOULD THINK MISS WHEN HE
WAS IN SUCH DANGER YOU MUST HAVE BEEN DREAMING
I WAS NOT DREAMING I SAID WITH SOME WARMTH FOR HER BRAZEN COOLNESS
PROVOKED ME
AGAIN SHE LOOKED AT ME AND WITH THE SAME SCRUTINISING AND
CONSCIOUS EYE
HAVE YOU TOLD MASTER THAT YOU HEARD A LAUGH SHE INQUIRED
I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO HIM THIS MORNING
YOU DID NOT THINK OF OPENING YOUR DOOR AND LOOKING OUT INTO THE
GALLERY SHE FURTHER ASKED
SHE APPEARED TO BE CROSS QUESTIONING ME ATTEMPTING TO DRAW FROM ME
INFORMATION UNAWARES
THE IDEA STRUCK ME THAT IF SHE DISCOVERED I KNEW
OR SUSPECTED HER GUILT SHE WOULD BE PLAYING OF SOME OF HER MALIGNANT
PRANKS ON ME I THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE TO BE ON MY GUARD
ON THE CONTRARY SAID I I BOLTED MY DOOR
THEN YOU ARE NOT IN THE HABIT OF BOLTING YOUR DOOR EVERY NIGHT BEFORE
YOU GET INTO BED
FIEND SHE WANTS TO KNOW MY HABITS THAT SHE MAY LAY HER PLANS
ACCORDINGLY INDIGNATION AGAIN PREVAILED OVER PRUDENCE I REPLIED
SHARPLY HITHERTO I HAVE OFTEN OMITTED TO FASTEN THE BOLT I DID NOT
THINK IT NECESSARY
I WAS NOT AWARE ANY DANGER OR ANNOYANCE WAS TO BE
DREADED AT THORNFIELD HALL BUT IN FUTURE AND I LAID MARKED STRESS ON
THE WORDS I SHALL TAKE GOOD CARE TO MAKE ALL SECURE BEFORE I VENTURE TO
LIE DOWN
IT WILL BE WISE SO TO DO WAS HER ANSWER THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD IS AS
QUIET AS ANY I KNOW AND I NEVER HEARD OF THE HALL BEING ATTEMPTED BY
ROBBERS SINCE IT WAS A HOUSE THOUGH THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF POUNDS' WORTH
OF PLATE IN THE PLATE CLOSET AS IS WELL KNOWN
AND YOU SEE FOR SUCH A
LARGE HOUSE THERE ARE VERY FEW SERVANTS BECAUSE MASTER HAS NEVER LIVED
HERE MUCH AND WHEN HE DOES COME BEING A BACHELOR HE NEEDS LITTLE
WAITING ON BUT I ALWAYS THINK IT BEST TO ERR ON THE SAFE SIDE A DOOR IS
SOON FASTENED AND IT IS AS WELL TO HAVE A DRAWN BOLT BETWEEN ONE AND ANY
MISCHIEF THAT MAY BE ABOUT
A DEAL OF PEOPLE MISS ARE FOR TRUSTING ALL
TO PROVIDENCE BUT I SAY PROVIDENCE WILL NOT DISPENSE WITH THE MEANS
THOUGH HE OFTEN BLESSES THEM WHEN THEY ARE USED DISCREETLY AND HERE
SHE CLOSED HER HARANGUE A LONG ONE FOR HER AND UTTERED WITH THE
DEMURENESS OF A QUAKERESS
I STILL STOOD ABSOLUTELY DUMFOUNDERED AT WHAT APPEARED TO ME HER
MIRACULOUS SELF POSSESSION AND MOST INSCRUTABLE HYPOCRISY WHEN THE COOK
ENTERED
MRS
POOLE SAID SHE ADDRESSING GRACE THE SERVANTS' DINNER WILL SOON
BE READY WILL YOU COME DOWN
NO JUST PUT MY PINT OF PORTER AND BIT OF PUDDING ON A TRAY AND I'LL
CARRY IT UPSTAIRS
YOU'LL HAVE SOME MEAT
JUST A MORSEL AND A TASTE OF CHEESE THAT'S ALL
AND THE SAGO
NEVER MIND IT AT PRESENT I SHALL BE COMING DOWN BEFORE TEATIME I'LL
MAKE IT MYSELF
THE COOK HERE TURNED TO ME SAYING THAT MRS
FAIRFAX WAS WAITING FOR ME
SO I DEPARTED
I HARDLY HEARD MRS
FAIRFAX'S ACCOUNT OF THE CURTAIN CONFLAGRATION DURING
DINNER SO MUCH WAS I OCCUPIED IN PUZZLING MY BRAINS OVER THE ENIGMATICAL
CHARACTER OF GRACE POOLE AND STILL MORE IN PONDERING THE PROBLEM OF HER
POSITION AT THORNFIELD AND QUESTIONING WHY SHE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN INTO
CUSTODY THAT MORNING OR AT THE VERY LEAST DISMISSED FROM HER MASTER'S
SERVICE
HE HAD ALMOST AS MUCH AS DECLARED HIS CONVICTION OF HER
CRIMINALITY LAST NIGHT WHAT MYSTERIOUS CAUSE WITHHELD HIM FROM ACCUSING
HER WHY HAD HE ENJOINED ME TOO TO SECRECY IT WAS STRANGE A BOLD
VINDICTIVE AND HAUGHTY GENTLEMAN SEEMED SOMEHOW IN THE POWER OF ONE OF
THE MEANEST OF HIS DEPENDANTS SO MUCH IN HER POWER THAT EVEN WHEN SHE
LIFTED HER HAND AGAINST HIS LIFE HE DARED NOT OPENLY CHARGE HER WITH THE
ATTEMPT MUCH LESS PUNISH HER FOR IT
HAD GRACE BEEN YOUNG AND HANDSOME I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO THINK
THAT TENDERER FEELINGS THAN PRUDENCE OR FEAR INFLUENCED MR
ROCHESTER IN
HER BEHALF BUT HARD FAVOURED AND MATRONLY AS SHE WAS THE IDEA COULD
NOT BE ADMITTED
YET I REFLECTED SHE HAS BEEN YOUNG ONCE HER YOUTH
WOULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH HER MASTER'S MRS
FAIRFAX TOLD ME ONCE SHE
HAD LIVED HERE MANY YEARS
I DON'T THINK SHE CAN EVER HAVE BEEN PRETTY
BUT FOR AUGHT I KNOW SHE MAY POSSESS ORIGINALITY AND STRENGTH OF
CHARACTER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE WANT OF PERSONAL ADVANTAGES
MR
ROCHESTER IS AN AMATEUR OF THE DECIDED AND ECCENTRIC GRACE IS ECCENTRIC
AT LEAST
WHAT IF A FORMER CAPRICE A FREAK VERY POSSIBLE TO A NATURE SO
SUDDEN AND HEADSTRONG AS HIS HAS DELIVERED HIM INTO HER POWER AND SHE
NOW EXERCISES OVER HIS ACTIONS A SECRET INFLUENCE THE RESULT OF HIS OWN
INDISCRETION WHICH HE CANNOT SHAKE OFF AND DARE NOT DISREGARD BUT
HAVING REACHED THIS POINT OF CONJECTURE MRS
POOLE'S SQUARE FLAT
FIGURE AND UNCOMELY DRY EVEN COARSE FACE RECURRED SO DISTINCTLY TO MY
MIND'S EYE THAT I THOUGHT NO IMPOSSIBLE MY SUPPOSITION CANNOT BE
CORRECT
YET SUGGESTED THE SECRET VOICE WHICH TALKS TO US IN OUR OWN
HEARTS YOU ARE NOT BEAUTIFUL EITHER AND PERHAPS MR
ROCHESTER APPROVES
YOU AT ANY RATE YOU HAVE OFTEN FELT AS IF HE DID AND LAST
NIGHT REMEMBER HIS WORDS REMEMBER HIS LOOK REMEMBER HIS VOICE
I WELL REMEMBERED ALL LANGUAGE GLANCE AND TONE SEEMED AT THE MOMENT
VIVIDLY RENEWED
I WAS NOW IN THE SCHOOLROOM ADELE WAS DRAWING I BENT
OVER HER AND DIRECTED HER PENCIL
SHE LOOKED UP WITH A SORT OF START
QU' AVEZ VOUS MADEMOISELLE SAID SHE
VOS DOIGTS TREMBLENT COMME LA
FEUILLE ET VOS JOUES SONT ROUGES MAIS ROUGES COMME DES CERISES
I AM HOT ADELE WITH STOOPING SHE WENT ON SKETCHING I WENT ON
THINKING
I HASTENED TO DRIVE FROM MY MIND THE HATEFUL NOTION I HAD BEEN CONCEIVING
RESPECTING GRACE POOLE IT DISGUSTED ME
I COMPARED MYSELF WITH HER AND
FOUND WE WERE DIFFERENT
BESSIE LEAVEN HAD SAID I WAS QUITE A LADY AND
SHE SPOKE TRUTH I WAS A LADY
AND NOW I LOOKED MUCH BETTER THAN I DID
WHEN BESSIE SAW ME I HAD MORE COLOUR AND MORE FLESH MORE LIFE MORE
VIVACITY BECAUSE I HAD BRIGHTER HOPES AND KEENER ENJOYMENTS
EVENING APPROACHES SAID I AS I LOOKED TOWARDS THE WINDOW
I HAVE
NEVER HEARD MR
ROCHESTER'S VOICE OR STEP IN THE HOUSE TO DAY BUT SURELY
I SHALL SEE HIM BEFORE NIGHT I FEARED THE MEETING IN THE MORNING NOW I
DESIRE IT BECAUSE EXPECTATION HAS BEEN SO LONG BAFFLED THAT IT IS GROWN
IMPATIENT
WHEN DUSK ACTUALLY CLOSED AND WHEN ADELE LEFT ME TO GO AND PLAY IN THE
NURSERY WITH SOPHIE I DID MOST KEENLY DESIRE IT
I LISTENED FOR THE
BELL TO RING BELOW I LISTENED FOR LEAH COMING UP WITH A MESSAGE I
FANCIED SOMETIMES I HEARD MR
ROCHESTER'S OWN TREAD AND I TURNED TO THE
DOOR EXPECTING IT TO OPEN AND ADMIT HIM
THE DOOR REMAINED SHUT
DARKNESS ONLY CAME IN THROUGH THE WINDOW
STILL IT WAS NOT LATE HE
OFTEN SENT FOR ME AT SEVEN AND EIGHT O'CLOCK AND IT WAS YET BUT SIX
SURELY I SHOULD NOT BE WHOLLY DISAPPOINTED TO NIGHT WHEN I HAD SO MANY
THINGS TO SAY TO HIM I WANTED AGAIN TO INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT OF GRACE
POOLE AND TO HEAR WHAT HE WOULD ANSWER I WANTED TO ASK HIM PLAINLY IF
HE REALLY BELIEVED IT WAS SHE WHO HAD MADE LAST NIGHT'S HIDEOUS ATTEMPT
AND IF SO WHY HE KEPT HER WICKEDNESS A SECRET
IT LITTLE MATTERED
WHETHER MY CURIOSITY IRRITATED HIM I KNEW THE PLEASURE OF VEXING AND
SOOTHING HIM BY TURNS IT WAS ONE I CHIEFLY DELIGHTED IN AND A SURE
INSTINCT ALWAYS PREVENTED ME FROM GOING TOO FAR BEYOND THE VERGE OF
PROVOCATION I NEVER VENTURED ON THE EXTREME BRINK I LIKED WELL TO TRY MY
SKILL
RETAINING EVERY MINUTE FORM OF RESPECT EVERY PROPRIETY OF MY
STATION I COULD STILL MEET HIM IN ARGUMENT WITHOUT FEAR OR UNEASY
RESTRAINT THIS SUITED BOTH HIM AND ME
A TREAD CREAKED ON THE STAIRS AT LAST
LEAH MADE HER APPEARANCE BUT IT
WAS ONLY TO INTIMATE THAT TEA WAS READY IN MRS
FAIRFAX'S ROOM
THITHER
I REPAIRED GLAD AT LEAST TO GO DOWNSTAIRS FOR THAT BROUGHT ME I
IMAGINED NEARER TO MR
ROCHESTER'S PRESENCE
YOU MUST WANT YOUR TEA SAID THE GOOD LADY AS I JOINED HER YOU ATE
SO LITTLE AT DINNER
I AM AFRAID SHE CONTINUED YOU ARE NOT WELL TO
DAY YOU LOOK FLUSHED AND FEVERISH
OH QUITE WELL I NEVER FELT BETTER
THEN YOU MUST PROVE IT BY EVINCING A GOOD APPETITE WILL YOU FILL THE
TEAPOT WHILE I KNIT OFF THIS NEEDLE HAVING COMPLETED HER TASK SHE
ROSE TO DRAW DOWN THE BLIND WHICH SHE HAD HITHERTO KEPT UP BY WAY I
SUPPOSE OF MAKING THE MOST OF DAYLIGHT THOUGH DUSK WAS NOW FAST
DEEPENING INTO TOTAL OBSCURITY
IT IS FAIR TO NIGHT SAID SHE AS SHE LOOKED THROUGH THE PANES THOUGH
NOT STARLIGHT MR
ROCHESTER HAS ON THE WHOLE HAD A FAVOURABLE DAY FOR
HIS JOURNEY
JOURNEY IS MR
ROCHESTER GONE ANYWHERE I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS OUT
OH HE SET OFF THE MOMENT HE HAD BREAKFASTED HE IS GONE TO THE LEAS
MR
ESHTON'S PLACE TEN MILES ON THE OTHER SIDE MILLCOTE
I BELIEVE
THERE IS QUITE A PARTY ASSEMBLED THERE LORD INGRAM SIR GEORGE LYNN
COLONEL DENT AND OTHERS
DO YOU EXPECT HIM BACK TO NIGHT
NO NOR TO MORROW EITHER I SHOULD THINK HE IS VERY LIKELY TO STAY A
WEEK OR MORE WHEN THESE FINE FASHIONABLE PEOPLE GET TOGETHER THEY ARE
SO SURROUNDED BY ELEGANCE AND GAIETY SO WELL PROVIDED WITH ALL THAT CAN
PLEASE AND ENTERTAIN THEY ARE IN NO HURRY TO SEPARATE
GENTLEMEN
ESPECIALLY ARE OFTEN IN REQUEST ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND MR
ROCHESTER IS
SO TALENTED AND SO LIVELY IN SOCIETY THAT I BELIEVE HE IS A GENERAL
FAVOURITE THE LADIES ARE VERY FOND OF HIM THOUGH YOU WOULD NOT THINK
HIS APPEARANCE CALCULATED TO RECOMMEND HIM PARTICULARLY IN THEIR EYES
BUT I SUPPOSE HIS ACQUIREMENTS AND ABILITIES PERHAPS HIS WEALTH AND GOOD
BLOOD MAKE AMENDS FOR ANY LITTLE FAULT OF LOOK
ARE THERE LADIES AT THE LEAS
THERE ARE MRS
ESHTON AND HER THREE DAUGHTERS VERY ELEGANT YOUNG LADIES
INDEED AND THERE ARE THE HONOURABLE BLANCHE AND MARY INGRAM MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN I SUPPOSE INDEED I HAVE SEEN BLANCHE SIX OR SEVEN
YEARS SINCE WHEN SHE WAS A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN
SHE CAME HERE TO A
CHRISTMAS BALL AND PARTY MR
ROCHESTER GAVE
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE
DINING ROOM THAT DAY HOW RICHLY IT WAS DECORATED HOW BRILLIANTLY LIT
UP I SHOULD THINK THERE WERE FIFTY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PRESENT ALL OF
THE FIRST COUNTY FAMILIES AND MISS INGRAM WAS CONSIDERED THE BELLE OF
THE EVENING
YOU SAW HER YOU SAY MRS
FAIRFAX WHAT WAS SHE LIKE
YES I SAW HER
THE DINING ROOM DOORS WERE THROWN OPEN AND AS IT WAS
CHRISTMAS TIME THE SERVANTS WERE ALLOWED TO ASSEMBLE IN THE HALL TO
HEAR SOME OF THE LADIES SING AND PLAY
MR
ROCHESTER WOULD HAVE ME TO
COME IN AND I SAT DOWN IN A QUIET CORNER AND WATCHED THEM
I NEVER SAW
A MORE SPLENDID SCENE THE LADIES WERE MAGNIFICENTLY DRESSED MOST OF
THEM AT LEAST MOST OF THE YOUNGER ONES LOOKED HANDSOME BUT MISS INGRAM
WAS CERTAINLY THE QUEEN
AND WHAT WAS SHE LIKE
TALL FINE BUST SLOPING SHOULDERS LONG GRACEFUL NECK OLIVE
COMPLEXION DARK AND CLEAR NOBLE FEATURES EYES RATHER LIKE MR
ROCHESTER'S LARGE AND BLACK AND AS BRILLIANT AS HER JEWELS
AND THEN
SHE HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD OF HAIR RAVEN BLACK AND SO BECOMINGLY ARRANGED
A CROWN OF THICK PLAITS BEHIND AND IN FRONT THE LONGEST THE GLOSSIEST
CURLS I EVER SAW
SHE WAS DRESSED IN PURE WHITE AN AMBER COLOURED SCARF
WAS PASSED OVER HER SHOULDER AND ACROSS HER BREAST TIED AT THE SIDE AND
DESCENDING IN LONG FRINGED ENDS BELOW HER KNEE
SHE WORE AN
AMBER COLOURED FLOWER TOO IN HER HAIR IT CONTRASTED WELL WITH THE
JETTY MASS OF HER CURLS
SHE WAS GREATLY ADMIRED OF COURSE
YES INDEED AND NOT ONLY FOR HER BEAUTY BUT FOR HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS
SHE WAS ONE OF THE LADIES WHO SANG A GENTLEMAN ACCOMPANIED HER ON THE
PIANO
SHE AND MR
ROCHESTER SANG A DUET
MR
ROCHESTER I WAS NOT AWARE HE COULD SING
OH HE HAS A FINE BASS VOICE AND AN EXCELLENT TASTE FOR MUSIC
AND MISS INGRAM WHAT SORT OF A VOICE HAD SHE
A VERY RICH AND POWERFUL ONE SHE SANG DELIGHTFULLY IT WAS A TREAT TO
LISTEN TO HER AND SHE PLAYED AFTERWARDS
I AM NO JUDGE OF MUSIC BUT
MR
ROCHESTER IS AND I HEARD HIM SAY HER EXECUTION WAS REMARKABLY GOOD
AND THIS BEAUTIFUL AND ACCOMPLISHED LADY SHE IS NOT YET MARRIED
IT APPEARS NOT I FANCY NEITHER SHE NOR HER SISTER HAVE VERY LARGE
FORTUNES
OLD LORD INGRAM'S ESTATES WERE CHIEFLY ENTAILED AND THE
ELDEST SON CAME IN FOR EVERYTHING ALMOST
BUT I WONDER NO WEALTHY NOBLEMAN OR GENTLEMAN HAS TAKEN A FANCY TO HER
MR
ROCHESTER FOR INSTANCE
HE IS RICH IS HE NOT
OH YES
BUT YOU SEE THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE IN AGE MR
ROCHESTER IS NEARLY FORTY SHE IS BUT TWENTY FIVE
WHAT OF THAT MORE UNEQUAL MATCHES ARE MADE EVERY DAY
TRUE YET I SHOULD SCARCELY FANCY MR
ROCHESTER WOULD ENTERTAIN AN IDEA
OF THE SORT
BUT YOU EAT NOTHING YOU HAVE SCARCELY TASTED SINCE YOU
BEGAN TEA
NO I AM TOO THIRSTY TO EAT
WILL YOU LET ME HAVE ANOTHER CUP
I WAS ABOUT AGAIN TO REVERT TO THE PROBABILITY OF A UNION BETWEEN MR
ROCHESTER AND THE BEAUTIFUL BLANCHE BUT ADELE CAME IN AND THE
CONVERSATION WAS TURNED INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
WHEN ONCE MORE ALONE I REVIEWED THE INFORMATION I HAD GOT LOOKED INTO
MY HEART EXAMINED ITS THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND ENDEAVOURED TO BRING
BACK WITH A STRICT HAND SUCH AS HAD BEEN STRAYING THROUGH IMAGINATION'S
BOUNDLESS AND TRACKLESS WASTE INTO THE SAFE FOLD OF COMMON SENSE
ARRAIGNED AT MY OWN BAR MEMORY HAVING GIVEN HER EVIDENCE OF THE HOPES
WISHES SENTIMENTS I HAD BEEN CHERISHING SINCE LAST NIGHT OF THE GENERAL
STATE OF MIND IN WHICH I HAD INDULGED FOR NEARLY A FORTNIGHT PAST REASON
HAVING COME FORWARD AND TOLD IN HER OWN QUIET WAY A PLAIN UNVARNISHED
TALE SHOWING HOW I HAD REJECTED THE REAL AND RABIDLY DEVOURED THE
IDEAL I PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT TO THIS EFFECT
THAT A GREATER FOOL THAN JANE EYRE HAD NEVER BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE
THAT A MORE FANTASTIC IDIOT HAD NEVER SURFEITED HERSELF ON SWEET LIES
AND SWALLOWED POISON AS IF IT WERE NECTAR
YOU I SAID A FAVOURITE WITH MR
ROCHESTER YOU GIFTED WITH THE
POWER OF PLEASING HIM YOU OF IMPORTANCE TO HIM IN ANY WAY GO YOUR
FOLLY SICKENS ME
AND YOU HAVE DERIVED PLEASURE FROM OCCASIONAL TOKENS
OF PREFERENCE EQUIVOCAL TOKENS SHOWN BY A GENTLEMAN OF FAMILY AND A MAN
OF THE WORLD TO A DEPENDENT AND A NOVICE
HOW DARED YOU POOR STUPID
DUPE COULD NOT EVEN SELF INTEREST MAKE YOU WISER YOU REPEATED TO
YOURSELF THIS MORNING THE BRIEF SCENE OF LAST NIGHT COVER YOUR FACE AND
BE ASHAMED HE SAID SOMETHING IN PRAISE OF YOUR EYES DID HE BLIND
PUPPY OPEN THEIR BLEARED LIDS AND LOOK ON YOUR OWN ACCURSED
SENSELESSNESS IT DOES GOOD TO NO WOMAN TO BE FLATTERED BY HER SUPERIOR
WHO CANNOT POSSIBLY INTEND TO MARRY HER AND IT IS MADNESS IN ALL WOMEN
TO LET A SECRET LOVE KINDLE WITHIN THEM WHICH IF UNRETURNED AND
UNKNOWN MUST DEVOUR THE LIFE THAT FEEDS IT AND IF DISCOVERED AND
RESPONDED TO MUST LEAD IGNIS FATUS LIKE INTO MIRY WILDS WHENCE THERE
IS NO EXTRICATION
LISTEN THEN JANE EYRE TO YOUR SENTENCE TO MORROW PLACE THE GLASS
BEFORE YOU AND DRAW IN CHALK YOUR OWN PICTURE FAITHFULLY WITHOUT
SOFTENING ONE DEFECT OMIT NO HARSH LINE SMOOTH AWAY NO DISPLEASING
IRREGULARITY WRITE UNDER IT 'PORTRAIT OF A GOVERNESS DISCONNECTED
POOR AND PLAIN
AFTERWARDS TAKE A PIECE OF SMOOTH IVORY YOU HAVE ONE PREPARED IN YOUR
DRAWING BOX TAKE YOUR PALETTE MIX YOUR FRESHEST FINEST CLEAREST
TINTS CHOOSE YOUR MOST DELICATE CAMEL HAIR PENCILS DELINEATE CAREFULLY
THE LOVELIEST FACE YOU CAN IMAGINE PAINT IT IN YOUR SOFTEST SHADES AND
SWEETEST LINES ACCORDING TO THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY MRS
FAIRFAX OF
BLANCHE INGRAM REMEMBER THE RAVEN RINGLETS THE ORIENTAL EYE WHAT YOU
REVERT TO MR
ROCHESTER AS A MODEL ORDER NO SNIVEL NO SENTIMENT NO
REGRET I WILL ENDURE ONLY SENSE AND RESOLUTION
RECALL THE AUGUST YET
HARMONIOUS LINEAMENTS THE GRECIAN NECK AND BUST LET THE ROUND AND
DAZZLING ARM BE VISIBLE AND THE DELICATE HAND OMIT NEITHER DIAMOND RING
NOR GOLD BRACELET PORTRAY FAITHFULLY THE ATTIRE AERIAL LACE AND
GLISTENING SATIN GRACEFUL SCARF AND GOLDEN ROSE CALL IT 'BLANCHE AN
ACCOMPLISHED LADY OF RANK
WHENEVER IN FUTURE YOU SHOULD CHANCE TO FANCY MR
ROCHESTER THINKS
WELL OF YOU TAKE OUT THESE TWO PICTURES AND COMPARE THEM SAY 'MR
ROCHESTER MIGHT PROBABLY WIN THAT NOBLE LADY'S LOVE IF HE CHOSE TO
STRIVE FOR IT IS IT LIKELY HE WOULD WASTE A SERIOUS THOUGHT ON THIS
INDIGENT AND INSIGNIFICANT PLEBEIAN
I'LL DO IT I RESOLVED AND HAVING FRAMED THIS DETERMINATION I GREW
CALM AND FELL ASLEEP
I KEPT MY WORD
AN HOUR OR TWO SUFFICED TO SKETCH MY OWN PORTRAIT IN
CRAYONS AND IN LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT I HAD COMPLETED AN IVORY MINIATURE
OF AN IMAGINARY BLANCHE INGRAM
IT LOOKED A LOVELY FACE ENOUGH AND WHEN
COMPARED WITH THE REAL HEAD IN CHALK THE CONTRAST WAS AS GREAT AS SELF
CONTROL COULD DESIRE
I DERIVED BENEFIT FROM THE TASK IT HAD KEPT MY
HEAD AND HANDS EMPLOYED AND HAD GIVEN FORCE AND FIXEDNESS TO THE NEW
IMPRESSIONS I WISHED TO STAMP INDELIBLY ON MY HEART
ERE LONG I HAD REASON TO CONGRATULATE MYSELF ON THE COURSE OF WHOLESOME
DISCIPLINE TO WHICH I HAD THUS FORCED MY FEELINGS TO SUBMIT
THANKS TO
IT I WAS ABLE TO MEET SUBSEQUENT OCCURRENCES WITH A DECENT CALM WHICH
HAD THEY FOUND ME UNPREPARED I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN UNEQUAL TO
MAINTAIN EVEN EXTERNALLY
CHAPTER XVII
A WEEK PASSED AND NO NEWS ARRIVED OF MR
ROCHESTER TEN DAYS AND STILL
HE DID NOT COME
MRS
FAIRFAX SAID SHE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF HE
WERE TO GO STRAIGHT FROM THE LEAS TO LONDON AND THENCE TO THE CONTINENT
AND NOT SHOW HIS FACE AGAIN AT THORNFIELD FOR A YEAR TO COME HE HAD NOT
UNFREQUENTLY QUITTED IT IN A MANNER QUITE AS ABRUPT AND UNEXPECTED
WHEN
I HEARD THIS I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A STRANGE CHILL AND FAILING AT THE
HEART
I WAS ACTUALLY PERMITTING MYSELF TO EXPERIENCE A SICKENING SENSE
OF DISAPPOINTMENT BUT RALLYING MY WITS AND RECOLLECTING MY PRINCIPLES
I AT ONCE CALLED MY SENSATIONS TO ORDER AND IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW I GOT
OVER THE TEMPORARY BLUNDER HOW I CLEARED UP THE MISTAKE OF SUPPOSING MR
ROCHESTER'S MOVEMENTS A MATTER IN WHICH I HAD ANY CAUSE TO TAKE A VITAL
INTEREST
NOT THAT I HUMBLED MYSELF BY A SLAVISH NOTION OF INFERIORITY
ON THE CONTRARY I JUST SAID
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MASTER OF THORNFIELD FURTHER THAN TO
RECEIVE THE SALARY HE GIVES YOU FOR TEACHING HIS PROTEGEE AND TO BE
GRATEFUL FOR SUCH RESPECTFUL AND KIND TREATMENT AS IF YOU DO YOUR DUTY
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT AT HIS HANDS
BE SURE THAT IS THE ONLY TIE HE
SERIOUSLY ACKNOWLEDGES BETWEEN YOU AND HIM SO DON'T MAKE HIM THE OBJECT
OF YOUR FINE FEELINGS YOUR RAPTURES AGONIES AND SO FORTH
HE IS NOT
OF YOUR ORDER KEEP TO YOUR CASTE AND BE TOO SELF RESPECTING TO LAVISH
THE LOVE OF THE WHOLE HEART SOUL AND STRENGTH WHERE SUCH A GIFT IS NOT
WANTED AND WOULD BE DESPISED
I WENT ON WITH MY DAY'S BUSINESS TRANQUILLY BUT EVER AND ANON VAGUE
SUGGESTIONS KEPT WANDERING ACROSS MY BRAIN OF REASONS WHY I SHOULD QUIT
THORNFIELD AND I KEPT INVOLUNTARILY FRAMING ADVERTISEMENTS AND PONDERING
CONJECTURES ABOUT NEW SITUATIONS THESE THOUGHTS I DID NOT THINK TO
CHECK THEY MIGHT GERMINATE AND BEAR FRUIT IF THEY COULD
MR
ROCHESTER HAD BEEN ABSENT UPWARDS OF A FORTNIGHT WHEN THE POST
BROUGHT MRS
FAIRFAX A LETTER
IT IS FROM THE MASTER SAID SHE AS SHE LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION
NOW
I SUPPOSE WE SHALL KNOW WHETHER WE ARE TO EXPECT HIS RETURN OR NOT
AND WHILE SHE BROKE THE SEAL AND PERUSED THE DOCUMENT I WENT ON TAKING
MY COFFEE WE WERE AT BREAKFAST IT WAS HOT AND I ATTRIBUTED TO THAT
CIRCUMSTANCE A FIERY GLOW WHICH SUDDENLY ROSE TO MY FACE
WHY MY HAND
SHOOK AND WHY I INVOLUNTARILY SPILT HALF THE CONTENTS OF MY CUP INTO MY
SAUCER I DID NOT CHOOSE TO CONSIDER
WELL I SOMETIMES THINK WE ARE TOO QUIET BUT WE RUN A CHANCE OF BEING
BUSY ENOUGH NOW FOR A LITTLE WHILE AT LEAST SAID MRS
FAIRFAX STILL
HOLDING THE NOTE BEFORE HER SPECTACLES
ERE I PERMITTED MYSELF TO REQUEST AN EXPLANATION I TIED THE STRING OF
ADELE'S PINAFORE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE LOOSE HAVING HELPED HER ALSO TO
ANOTHER BUN AND REFILLED HER MUG WITH MILK I SAID NONCHALANTLY
MR
ROCHESTER IS NOT LIKELY TO RETURN SOON I SUPPOSE
INDEED HE IS IN THREE DAYS HE SAYS THAT WILL BE NEXT THURSDAY AND
NOT ALONE EITHER
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THE FINE PEOPLE AT THE LEAS
ARE COMING WITH HIM HE SENDS DIRECTIONS FOR ALL THE BEST BEDROOMS TO BE
PREPARED AND THE LIBRARY AND DRAWING ROOMS ARE TO BE CLEANED OUT I AM
TO GET MORE KITCHEN HANDS FROM THE GEORGE INN AT MILLCOTE AND FROM
WHEREVER ELSE I CAN AND THE LADIES WILL BRING THEIR MAIDS AND THE
GENTLEMEN THEIR VALETS SO WE SHALL HAVE A FULL HOUSE OF IT AND MRS
FAIRFAX SWALLOWED HER BREAKFAST AND HASTENED AWAY TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS
THE THREE DAYS WERE AS SHE HAD FORETOLD BUSY ENOUGH
I HAD THOUGHT ALL
THE ROOMS AT THORNFIELD BEAUTIFULLY CLEAN AND WELL ARRANGED BUT IT
APPEARS I WAS MISTAKEN
THREE WOMEN WERE GOT TO HELP AND SUCH
SCRUBBING SUCH BRUSHING SUCH WASHING OF PAINT AND BEATING OF CARPETS
SUCH TAKING DOWN AND PUTTING UP OF PICTURES SUCH POLISHING OF MIRRORS
AND LUSTRES SUCH LIGHTING OF FIRES IN BEDROOMS SUCH AIRING OF SHEETS
AND FEATHER BEDS ON HEARTHS I NEVER BEHELD EITHER BEFORE OR SINCE
ADELE RAN QUITE WILD IN THE MIDST OF IT THE PREPARATIONS FOR COMPANY AND
THE PROSPECT OF THEIR ARRIVAL SEEMED TO THROW HER INTO ECSTASIES
SHE
WOULD HAVE SOPHIE TO LOOK OVER ALL HER TOILETTES AS SHE CALLED FROCKS
TO FURBISH UP ANY THAT WERE PASSEES AND TO AIR AND ARRANGE THE NEW
FOR HERSELF SHE DID NOTHING BUT CAPER ABOUT IN THE FRONT CHAMBERS JUMP
ON AND OFF THE BEDSTEADS AND LIE ON THE MATTRESSES AND PILED UP BOLSTERS
AND PILLOWS BEFORE THE ENORMOUS FIRES ROARING IN THE CHIMNEYS
FROM
SCHOOL DUTIES SHE WAS EXONERATED MRS
FAIRFAX HAD PRESSED ME INTO HER
SERVICE AND I WAS ALL DAY IN THE STOREROOM HELPING OR HINDERING HER
AND THE COOK LEARNING TO MAKE CUSTARDS AND CHEESE CAKES AND FRENCH
PASTRY TO TRUSS GAME AND GARNISH DESERT DISHES
THE PARTY WERE EXPECTED TO ARRIVE ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON IN TIME FOR
DINNER AT SIX
DURING THE INTERVENING PERIOD I HAD NO TIME TO NURSE
CHIMERAS AND I BELIEVE I WAS AS ACTIVE AND GAY AS ANYBODY ADELE
EXCEPTED
STILL NOW AND THEN I RECEIVED A DAMPING CHECK TO MY
CHEERFULNESS AND WAS IN SPITE OF MYSELF THROWN BACK ON THE REGION OF
DOUBTS AND PORTENTS AND DARK CONJECTURES
THIS WAS WHEN I CHANCED TO
SEE THE THIRD STOREY STAIRCASE DOOR WHICH OF LATE HAD ALWAYS BEEN KEPT
LOCKED OPEN SLOWLY AND GIVE PASSAGE TO THE FORM OF GRACE POOLE IN PRIM
CAP WHITE APRON AND HANDKERCHIEF WHEN I WATCHED HER GLIDE ALONG THE
GALLERY HER QUIET TREAD MUFFLED IN A LIST SLIPPER WHEN I SAW HER LOOK
INTO THE BUSTLING TOPSY TURVY BEDROOMS JUST SAY A WORD PERHAPS TO
THE CHARWOMAN ABOUT THE PROPER WAY TO POLISH A GRATE OR CLEAN A MARBLE
MANTELPIECE OR TAKE STAINS FROM PAPERED WALLS AND THEN PASS ON
SHE
WOULD THUS DESCEND TO THE KITCHEN ONCE A DAY EAT HER DINNER SMOKE A
MODERATE PIPE ON THE HEARTH AND GO BACK CARRYING HER POT OF PORTER WITH
HER FOR HER PRIVATE SOLACE IN HER OWN GLOOMY UPPER HAUNT
ONLY ONE
HOUR IN THE TWENTY FOUR DID SHE PASS WITH HER FELLOW SERVANTS BELOW ALL
THE REST OF HER TIME WAS SPENT IN SOME LOW CEILED OAKEN CHAMBER OF THE
SECOND STOREY THERE SHE SAT AND SEWED AND PROBABLY LAUGHED DREARILY TO
HERSELF AS COMPANIONLESS AS A PRISONER IN HIS DUNGEON
THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL WAS THAT NOT A SOUL IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT ME
NOTICED HER HABITS OR SEEMED TO MARVEL AT THEM NO ONE DISCUSSED HER
POSITION OR EMPLOYMENT NO ONE PITIED HER SOLITUDE OR ISOLATION
I ONCE
INDEED OVERHEARD PART OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN LEAH AND ONE OF THE
CHARWOMEN OF WHICH GRACE FORMED THE SUBJECT
LEAH HAD BEEN SAYING
SOMETHING I HAD NOT CAUGHT AND THE CHARWOMAN REMARKED
SHE GETS GOOD WAGES I GUESS
YES SAID LEAH I WISH I HAD AS GOOD NOT THAT MINE ARE TO COMPLAIN
OF THERE'S NO STINGINESS AT THORNFIELD BUT THEY'RE NOT ONE FIFTH OF
THE SUM MRS
POOLE RECEIVES
AND SHE IS LAYING BY SHE GOES EVERY
QUARTER TO THE BANK AT MILLCOTE
I SHOULD NOT WONDER BUT SHE HAS SAVED
ENOUGH TO KEEP HER INDEPENDENT IF SHE LIKED TO LEAVE BUT I SUPPOSE SHE'S
GOT USED TO THE PLACE AND THEN SHE'S NOT FORTY YET AND STRONG AND ABLE
FOR ANYTHING
IT IS TOO SOON FOR HER TO GIVE UP BUSINESS
SHE IS A GOOD HAND I DARESAY SAID THE CHARWOMAN
AH SHE UNDERSTANDS WHAT SHE HAS TO DO NOBODY BETTER REJOINED LEAH
SIGNIFICANTLY AND IT IS NOT EVERY ONE COULD FILL HER SHOES NOT FOR ALL
THE MONEY SHE GETS
THAT IT IS NOT WAS THE REPLY
I WONDER WHETHER THE MASTER
THE CHARWOMAN WAS GOING ON BUT HERE LEAH TURNED AND PERCEIVED ME AND
SHE INSTANTLY GAVE HER COMPANION A NUDGE
DOESN'T SHE KNOW I HEARD THE WOMAN WHISPER
LEAH SHOOK HER HEAD AND THE CONVERSATION WAS OF COURSE DROPPED
ALL I
HAD GATHERED FROM IT AMOUNTED TO THIS THAT THERE WAS A MYSTERY AT
THORNFIELD AND THAT FROM PARTICIPATION IN THAT MYSTERY I WAS PURPOSELY
EXCLUDED
THURSDAY CAME ALL WORK HAD BEEN COMPLETED THE PREVIOUS EVENING CARPETS
WERE LAID DOWN BED HANGINGS FESTOONED RADIANT WHITE COUNTERPANES
SPREAD TOILET TABLES ARRANGED FURNITURE RUBBED FLOWERS PILED IN VASES
BOTH CHAMBERS AND SALOONS LOOKED AS FRESH AND BRIGHT AS HANDS COULD MAKE
THEM
THE HALL TOO WAS SCOURED AND THE GREAT CARVED CLOCK AS WELL AS
THE STEPS AND BANISTERS OF THE STAIRCASE WERE POLISHED TO THE BRIGHTNESS
OF GLASS IN THE DINING ROOM THE SIDEBOARD FLASHED RESPLENDENT WITH
PLATE IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND BOUDOIR VASES OF EXOTICS BLOOMED ON ALL
SIDES
AFTERNOON ARRIVED MRS
FAIRFAX ASSUMED HER BEST BLACK SATIN GOWN HER
GLOVES AND HER GOLD WATCH FOR IT WAS HER PART TO RECEIVE THE
COMPANY TO CONDUCT THE LADIES TO THEIR ROOMS C
ADELE TOO WOULD BE
DRESSED THOUGH I THOUGHT SHE HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BEING INTRODUCED TO
THE PARTY THAT DAY AT LEAST
HOWEVER TO PLEASE HER I ALLOWED SOPHIE TO
APPAREL HER IN ONE OF HER SHORT FULL MUSLIN FROCKS
FOR MYSELF I HAD
NO NEED TO MAKE ANY CHANGE I SHOULD NOT BE CALLED UPON TO QUIT MY
SANCTUM OF THE SCHOOLROOM FOR A SANCTUM IT WAS NOW BECOME TO ME A
VERY PLEASANT REFUGE IN TIME OF TROUBLE
IT HAD BEEN A MILD SERENE SPRING DAY ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHICH TOWARDS
THE END OF MARCH OR THE BEGINNING OF APRIL RISE SHINING OVER THE EARTH
AS HERALDS OF SUMMER
IT WAS DRAWING TO AN END NOW BUT THE EVENING WAS
EVEN WARM AND I SAT AT WORK IN THE SCHOOLROOM WITH THE WINDOW OPEN
IT GETS LATE SAID MRS
FAIRFAX ENTERING IN RUSTLING STATE
I AM
GLAD I ORDERED DINNER AN HOUR AFTER THE TIME MR
ROCHESTER MENTIONED FOR
IT IS PAST SIX NOW
I HAVE SENT JOHN DOWN TO THE GATES TO SEE IF THERE
IS ANYTHING ON THE ROAD ONE CAN SEE A LONG WAY FROM THENCE IN THE
DIRECTION OF MILLCOTE SHE WENT TO THE WINDOW
HERE HE IS SAID SHE
WELL JOHN LEANING OUT ANY NEWS
THEY'RE COMING MA'AM WAS THE ANSWER
THEY'LL BE HERE IN TEN
MINUTES
ADELE FLEW TO THE WINDOW
I FOLLOWED TAKING CARE TO STAND ON ONE SIDE
SO THAT SCREENED BY THE CURTAIN I COULD SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN
THE TEN MINUTES JOHN HAD GIVEN SEEMED VERY LONG BUT AT LAST WHEELS WERE
HEARD FOUR EQUESTRIANS GALLOPED UP THE DRIVE AND AFTER THEM CAME TWO
OPEN CARRIAGES
FLUTTERING VEILS AND WAVING PLUMES FILLED THE VEHICLES
TWO OF THE CAVALIERS WERE YOUNG DASHING LOOKING GENTLEMEN THE THIRD WAS
MR
ROCHESTER ON HIS BLACK HORSE MESROUR PILOT BOUNDING BEFORE HIM AT
HIS SIDE RODE A LADY AND HE AND SHE WERE THE FIRST OF THE PARTY
HER
PURPLE RIDING HABIT ALMOST SWEPT THE GROUND HER VEIL STREAMED LONG ON
THE BREEZE MINGLING WITH ITS TRANSPARENT FOLDS AND GLEAMING THROUGH
THEM SHONE RICH RAVEN RINGLETS
MISS INGRAM EXCLAIMED MRS
FAIRFAX AND AWAY SHE HURRIED TO HER POST
BELOW
THE CAVALCADE FOLLOWING THE SWEEP OF THE DRIVE QUICKLY TURNED THE ANGLE
OF THE HOUSE AND I LOST SIGHT OF IT
ADELE NOW PETITIONED TO GO DOWN
BUT I TOOK HER ON MY KNEE AND GAVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE MUST NOT
ON ANY ACCOUNT THINK OF VENTURING IN SIGHT OF THE LADIES EITHER NOW OR
AT ANY OTHER TIME UNLESS EXPRESSLY SENT FOR THAT MR
ROCHESTER WOULD BE
VERY ANGRY C
SOME NATURAL TEARS SHE SHED ON BEING TOLD THIS BUT AS
I BEGAN TO LOOK VERY GRAVE SHE CONSENTED AT LAST TO WIPE THEM
A JOYOUS STIR WAS NOW AUDIBLE IN THE HALL GENTLEMEN'S DEEP TONES AND
LADIES' SILVERY ACCENTS BLENT HARMONIOUSLY TOGETHER AND DISTINGUISHABLE
ABOVE ALL THOUGH NOT LOUD WAS THE SONOROUS VOICE OF THE MASTER OF
THORNFIELD HALL WELCOMING HIS FAIR AND GALLANT GUESTS UNDER ITS ROOF
THEN LIGHT STEPS ASCENDED THE STAIRS AND THERE WAS A TRIPPING THROUGH
THE GALLERY AND SOFT CHEERFUL LAUGHS AND OPENING AND CLOSING DOORS
AND FOR A TIME A HUSH
ELLES CHANGENT DE TOILETTES SAID ADELE WHO LISTENING ATTENTIVELY
HAD FOLLOWED EVERY MOVEMENT AND SHE SIGHED
CHEZ MAMAN SAID SHE QUAND IL Y AVAIT DU MONDE JE LE SUIVAIS
PARTOUT AU SALON ET A LEURS CHAMBRES SOUVENT JE REGARDAIS LES FEMMES DE
CHAMBRE COIFFER ET HABILLER LES DAMES ET C'ETAIT SI AMUSANT COMME CELA
ON APPREND
DON'T YOU FEEL HUNGRY ADELE
MAIS OUI MADEMOISELLE VOILA CINQ OU SIX HEURES QUE NOUS N'AVONS PAS
MANGE
WELL NOW WHILE THE LADIES ARE IN THEIR ROOMS I WILL VENTURE DOWN AND
GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT
AND ISSUING FROM MY ASYLUM WITH PRECAUTION I SOUGHT A BACK STAIRS WHICH
CONDUCTED DIRECTLY TO THE KITCHEN
ALL IN THAT REGION WAS FIRE AND
COMMOTION THE SOUP AND FISH WERE IN THE LAST STAGE OF PROJECTION AND
THE COOK HUNG OVER HER CRUCIBLES IN A FRAME OF MIND AND BODY THREATENING
SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION
IN THE SERVANTS' HALL TWO COACHMEN AND THREE
GENTLEMEN'S GENTLEMEN STOOD OR SAT ROUND THE FIRE THE ABIGAILS I
SUPPOSE WERE UPSTAIRS WITH THEIR MISTRESSES THE NEW SERVANTS THAT HAD
BEEN HIRED FROM MILLCOTE WERE BUSTLING ABOUT EVERYWHERE
THREADING THIS
CHAOS I AT LAST REACHED THE LARDER THERE I TOOK POSSESSION OF A COLD
CHICKEN A ROLL OF BREAD SOME TARTS A PLATE OR TWO AND A KNIFE AND
FORK WITH THIS BOOTY I MADE A HASTY RETREAT
I HAD REGAINED THE
GALLERY AND WAS JUST SHUTTING THE BACK DOOR BEHIND ME WHEN AN
ACCELERATED HUM WARNED ME THAT THE LADIES WERE ABOUT TO ISSUE FROM THEIR
CHAMBERS
I COULD NOT PROCEED TO THE SCHOOLROOM WITHOUT PASSING SOME OF
THEIR DOORS AND RUNNING THE RISK OF BEING SURPRISED WITH MY CARGO OF
VICTUALAGE SO I STOOD STILL AT THIS END WHICH BEING WINDOWLESS WAS
DARK QUITE DARK NOW FOR THE SUN WAS SET AND TWILIGHT GATHERING
PRESENTLY THE CHAMBERS GAVE UP THEIR FAIR TENANTS ONE AFTER ANOTHER EACH
CAME OUT GAILY AND AIRILY WITH DRESS THAT GLEAMED LUSTROUS THROUGH THE
DUSK
FOR A MOMENT THEY STOOD GROUPED TOGETHER AT THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF
THE GALLERY CONVERSING IN A KEY OF SWEET SUBDUED VIVACITY THEY THEN
DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE ALMOST AS NOISELESSLY AS A BRIGHT MIST ROLLS DOWN
A HILL
THEIR COLLECTIVE APPEARANCE HAD LEFT ON ME AN IMPRESSION OF HIGH
BORN ELEGANCE SUCH AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE RECEIVED
I FOUND ADELE PEEPING THROUGH THE SCHOOLROOM DOOR WHICH SHE HELD AJAR
WHAT BEAUTIFUL LADIES CRIED SHE IN ENGLISH
OH I WISH I MIGHT GO TO
THEM DO YOU THINK MR
ROCHESTER WILL SEND FOR US BY AND BYE AFTER
DINNER
NO INDEED I DON'T MR
ROCHESTER HAS SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT
NEVER MIND THE LADIES TO NIGHT PERHAPS YOU WILL SEE THEM TO MORROW HERE
IS YOUR DINNER
SHE WAS REALLY HUNGRY SO THE CHICKEN AND TARTS SERVED TO DIVERT HER
ATTENTION FOR A TIME
IT WAS WELL I SECURED THIS FORAGE OR BOTH SHE I
AND SOPHIE TO WHOM I CONVEYED A SHARE OF OUR REPAST WOULD HAVE RUN A
CHANCE OF GETTING NO DINNER AT ALL EVERY ONE DOWNSTAIRS WAS TOO MUCH
ENGAGED TO THINK OF US
THE DESSERT WAS NOT CARRIED OUT TILL AFTER NINE
AND AT TEN FOOTMEN WERE STILL RUNNING TO AND FRO WITH TRAYS AND COFFEE
CUPS
I ALLOWED ADELE TO SIT UP MUCH LATER THAN USUAL FOR SHE DECLARED
SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GO TO SLEEP WHILE THE DOORS KEPT OPENING AND
SHUTTING BELOW AND PEOPLE BUSTLING ABOUT
BESIDES SHE ADDED A MESSAGE
MIGHT POSSIBLY COME FROM MR
ROCHESTER WHEN SHE WAS UNDRESSED ET ALORS
QUEL DOMMAGE
I TOLD HER STORIES AS LONG AS SHE WOULD LISTEN TO THEM AND THEN FOR A
CHANGE I TOOK HER OUT INTO THE GALLERY
THE HALL LAMP WAS NOW LIT AND
IT AMUSED HER TO LOOK OVER THE BALUSTRADE AND WATCH THE SERVANTS PASSING
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
WHEN THE EVENING WAS FAR ADVANCED A SOUND OF
MUSIC ISSUED FROM THE DRAWING ROOM WHITHER THE PIANO HAD BEEN REMOVED
ADELE AND I SAT DOWN ON THE TOP STEP OF THE STAIRS TO LISTEN
PRESENTLY
A VOICE BLENT WITH THE RICH TONES OF THE INSTRUMENT IT WAS A LADY WHO
SANG AND VERY SWEET HER NOTES WERE
THE SOLO OVER A DUET FOLLOWED AND
THEN A GLEE A JOYOUS CONVERSATIONAL MURMUR FILLED UP THE INTERVALS
I
LISTENED LONG SUDDENLY I DISCOVERED THAT MY EAR WAS WHOLLY INTENT ON
ANALYSING THE MINGLED SOUNDS AND TRYING TO DISCRIMINATE AMIDST THE
CONFUSION OF ACCENTS THOSE OF MR
ROCHESTER AND WHEN IT CAUGHT THEM
WHICH IT SOON DID IT FOUND A FURTHER TASK IN FRAMING THE TONES RENDERED
BY DISTANCE INARTICULATE INTO WORDS
THE CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN
I LOOKED AT ADELE WHOSE HEAD LEANT AGAINST MY
SHOULDER HER EYES WERE WAXING HEAVY SO I TOOK HER UP IN MY ARMS AND
CARRIED HER OFF TO BED
IT WAS NEAR ONE BEFORE THE GENTLEMEN AND LADIES
SOUGHT THEIR CHAMBERS
THE NEXT DAY WAS AS FINE AS ITS PREDECESSOR IT WAS DEVOTED BY THE PARTY
TO AN EXCURSION TO SOME SITE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
THEY SET OUT EARLY IN
THE FORENOON SOME ON HORSEBACK THE REST IN CARRIAGES I WITNESSED BOTH
THE DEPARTURE AND THE RETURN
MISS INGRAM AS BEFORE WAS THE ONLY LADY
EQUESTRIAN AND AS BEFORE MR
ROCHESTER GALLOPED AT HER SIDE THE TWO
RODE A LITTLE APART FROM THE REST
I POINTED OUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO
MRS
FAIRFAX WHO WAS STANDING AT THE WINDOW WITH ME
YOU SAID IT WAS NOT LIKELY THEY SHOULD THINK OF BEING MARRIED SAID I
BUT YOU SEE MR
ROCHESTER EVIDENTLY PREFERS HER TO ANY OF THE OTHER
LADIES
YES I DARESAY NO DOUBT HE ADMIRES HER
AND SHE HIM I ADDED LOOK HOW SHE LEANS HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM AS IF
SHE WERE CONVERSING CONFIDENTIALLY I WISH I COULD SEE HER FACE I HAVE
NEVER HAD A GLIMPSE OF IT YET
YOU WILL SEE HER THIS EVENING ANSWERED MRS
FAIRFAX
I HAPPENED TO
REMARK TO MR
ROCHESTER HOW MUCH ADELE WISHED TO BE INTRODUCED TO THE
LADIES AND HE SAID 'OH LET HER COME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER
DINNER AND REQUEST MISS EYRE TO ACCOMPANY HER
YES HE SAID THAT FROM MERE POLITENESS I NEED NOT GO I AM SURE I
ANSWERED
WELL I OBSERVED TO HIM THAT AS YOU WERE UNUSED TO COMPANY I DID NOT
THINK YOU WOULD LIKE APPEARING BEFORE SO GAY A PARTY ALL STRANGERS AND
HE REPLIED IN HIS QUICK WAY 'NONSENSE IF SHE OBJECTS TELL HER IT IS
MY PARTICULAR WISH AND IF SHE RESISTS SAY I SHALL COME AND FETCH HER IN
CASE OF CONTUMACY
I WILL NOT GIVE HIM THAT TROUBLE I ANSWERED
I WILL GO IF NO BETTER
MAY BE BUT I DON'T LIKE IT
SHALL YOU BE THERE MRS
FAIRFAX
NO I PLEADED OFF AND HE ADMITTED MY PLEA
I'LL TELL YOU HOW TO MANAGE
SO AS TO AVOID THE EMBARRASSMENT OF MAKING A FORMAL ENTRANCE WHICH IS
THE MOST DISAGREEABLE PART OF THE BUSINESS
YOU MUST GO INTO THE DRAWING
ROOM WHILE IT IS EMPTY BEFORE THE LADIES LEAVE THE DINNER TABLE CHOOSE
YOUR SEAT IN ANY QUIET NOOK YOU LIKE YOU NEED NOT STAY LONG AFTER THE
GENTLEMEN COME IN UNLESS YOU PLEASE JUST LET MR
ROCHESTER SEE YOU ARE
THERE AND THEN SLIP AWAY NOBODY WILL NOTICE YOU
WILL THESE PEOPLE REMAIN LONG DO YOU THINK
PERHAPS TWO OR THREE WEEKS CERTAINLY NOT MORE
AFTER THE EASTER
RECESS SIR GEORGE LYNN WHO WAS LATELY ELECTED MEMBER FOR MILLCOTE WILL
HAVE TO GO UP TO TOWN AND TAKE HIS SEAT I DARESAY MR
ROCHESTER WILL
ACCOMPANY HIM IT SURPRISES ME THAT HE HAS ALREADY MADE SO PROTRACTED A
STAY AT THORNFIELD
IT WAS WITH SOME TREPIDATION THAT I PERCEIVED THE HOUR APPROACH WHEN I
WAS TO REPAIR WITH MY CHARGE TO THE DRAWING ROOM
ADELE HAD BEEN IN A
STATE OF ECSTASY ALL DAY AFTER HEARING SHE WAS TO BE PRESENTED TO THE
LADIES IN THE EVENING AND IT WAS NOT TILL SOPHIE COMMENCED THE OPERATION
OF DRESSING HER THAT SHE SOBERED DOWN
THEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
PROCESS QUICKLY STEADIED HER AND BY THE TIME SHE HAD HER CURLS ARRANGED
IN WELL SMOOTHED DROOPING CLUSTERS HER PINK SATIN FROCK PUT ON HER
LONG SASH TIED AND HER LACE MITTENS ADJUSTED SHE LOOKED AS GRAVE AS ANY
JUDGE
NO NEED TO WARN HER NOT TO DISARRANGE HER ATTIRE WHEN SHE WAS
DRESSED SHE SAT DEMURELY DOWN IN HER LITTLE CHAIR TAKING CARE
PREVIOUSLY TO LIFT UP THE SATIN SKIRT FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD CREASE IT AND
ASSURED ME SHE WOULD NOT STIR THENCE TILL I WAS READY
THIS I QUICKLY
WAS MY BEST DRESS THE SILVER GREY ONE PURCHASED FOR MISS TEMPLE'S
WEDDING AND NEVER WORN SINCE WAS SOON PUT ON MY HAIR WAS SOON
SMOOTHED MY SOLE ORNAMENT THE PEARL BROOCH SOON ASSUMED
WE
DESCENDED
FORTUNATELY THERE WAS ANOTHER ENTRANCE TO THE DRAWING ROOM THAN THAT
THROUGH THE SALOON WHERE THEY WERE ALL SEATED AT DINNER
WE FOUND THE
APARTMENT VACANT A LARGE FIRE BURNING SILENTLY ON THE MARBLE HEARTH AND
WAX CANDLES SHINING IN BRIGHT SOLITUDE AMID THE EXQUISITE FLOWERS WITH
WHICH THE TABLES WERE ADORNED
THE CRIMSON CURTAIN HUNG BEFORE THE ARCH
SLIGHT AS WAS THE SEPARATION THIS DRAPERY FORMED FROM THE PARTY IN THE
ADJOINING SALOON THEY SPOKE IN SO LOW A KEY THAT NOTHING OF THEIR
CONVERSATION COULD BE DISTINGUISHED BEYOND A SOOTHING MURMUR
ADELE WHO APPEARED TO BE STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MOST SOLEMNISING
IMPRESSION SAT DOWN WITHOUT A WORD ON THE FOOTSTOOL I POINTED OUT TO
HER
I RETIRED TO A WINDOW SEAT AND TAKING A BOOK FROM A TABLE NEAR
ENDEAVOURED TO READ
ADELE BROUGHT HER STOOL TO MY FEET ERE LONG SHE
TOUCHED MY KNEE
WHAT IS IT ADELE
EST CE QUE JE NE PUIS PAS PRENDRIE UNE SEULE DE CES FLEURS MAGNIFIQUES
MADEMOISELLE SEULEMENT POUR COMPLETER MA TOILETTE
YOU THINK TOO MUCH OF YOUR 'TOILETTE ADELE BUT YOU MAY HAVE A
FLOWER AND I TOOK A ROSE FROM A VASE AND FASTENED IT IN HER SASH
SHE
SIGHED A SIGH OF INEFFABLE SATISFACTION AS IF HER CUP OF HAPPINESS WERE
NOW FULL
I TURNED MY FACE AWAY TO CONCEAL A SMILE I COULD NOT SUPPRESS
THERE WAS SOMETHING LUDICROUS AS WELL AS PAINFUL IN THE LITTLE
PARISIENNE'S EARNEST AND INNATE DEVOTION TO MATTERS OF DRESS
A SOFT SOUND OF RISING NOW BECAME AUDIBLE THE CURTAIN WAS SWEPT BACK
FROM THE ARCH THROUGH IT APPEARED THE DINING ROOM WITH ITS LIT LUSTRE
POURING DOWN LIGHT ON THE SILVER AND GLASS OF A MAGNIFICENT
DESSERT SERVICE COVERING A LONG TABLE A BAND OF LADIES STOOD IN THE
OPENING THEY ENTERED AND THE CURTAIN FELL BEHIND THEM
THERE WERE BUT EIGHT YET SOMEHOW AS THEY FLOCKED IN THEY GAVE THE
IMPRESSION OF A MUCH LARGER NUMBER
SOME OF THEM WERE VERY TALL MANY
WERE DRESSED IN WHITE AND ALL HAD A SWEEPING AMPLITUDE OF ARRAY THAT
SEEMED TO MAGNIFY THEIR PERSONS AS A MIST MAGNIFIES THE MOON
I ROSE AND
CURTSEYED TO THEM ONE OR TWO BENT THEIR HEADS IN RETURN THE OTHERS ONLY
STARED AT ME
THEY DISPERSED ABOUT THE ROOM REMINDING ME BY THE LIGHTNESS AND
BUOYANCY OF THEIR MOVEMENTS OF A FLOCK OF WHITE PLUMY BIRDS
SOME OF
THEM THREW THEMSELVES IN HALF RECLINING POSITIONS ON THE SOFAS AND
OTTOMANS SOME BENT OVER THE TABLES AND EXAMINED THE FLOWERS AND BOOKS
THE REST GATHERED IN A GROUP ROUND THE FIRE ALL TALKED IN A LOW BUT
CLEAR TONE WHICH SEEMED HABITUAL TO THEM
I KNEW THEIR NAMES AFTERWARDS
AND MAY AS WELL MENTION THEM NOW
FIRST THERE WAS MRS
ESHTON AND TWO OF HER DAUGHTERS
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY
BEEN A HANDSOME WOMAN AND WAS WELL PRESERVED STILL
OF HER DAUGHTERS
THE ELDEST AMY WAS RATHER LITTLE NAIVE AND CHILD LIKE IN FACE AND
MANNER AND PIQUANT IN FORM HER WHITE MUSLIN DRESS AND BLUE SASH BECAME
HER WELL
THE SECOND LOUISA WAS TALLER AND MORE ELEGANT IN FIGURE
WITH A VERY PRETTY FACE OF THAT ORDER THE FRENCH TERM MINOIS CHIFFONE
BOTH SISTERS WERE FAIR AS LILIES
LADY LYNN WAS A LARGE AND STOUT PERSONAGE OF ABOUT FORTY VERY ERECT
VERY HAUGHTY LOOKING RICHLY DRESSED IN A SATIN ROBE OF CHANGEFUL SHEEN
HER DARK HAIR SHONE GLOSSILY UNDER THE SHADE OF AN AZURE PLUME AND
WITHIN THE CIRCLET OF A BAND OF GEMS
MRS
COLONEL DENT WAS LESS SHOWY BUT I THOUGHT MORE LADY LIKE
SHE
HAD A SLIGHT FIGURE A PALE GENTLE FACE AND FAIR HAIR
HER BLACK SATIN
DRESS HER SCARF OF RICH FOREIGN LACE AND HER PEARL ORNAMENTS PLEASED
ME BETTER THAN THE RAINBOW RADIANCE OF THE TITLED DAME
BUT THE THREE MOST DISTINGUISHED PARTLY PERHAPS BECAUSE THE TALLEST
FIGURES OF THE BAND WERE THE DOWAGER LADY INGRAM AND HER DAUGHTERS
BLANCHE AND MARY
THEY WERE ALL THREE OF THE LOFTIEST STATURE OF WOMEN
THE DOWAGER MIGHT BE BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY HER SHAPE WAS STILL FINE
HER HAIR BY CANDLE LIGHT AT LEAST STILL BLACK HER TEETH TOO WERE
STILL APPARENTLY PERFECT
MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TERMED HER A SPLENDID
WOMAN OF HER AGE AND SO SHE WAS NO DOUBT PHYSICALLY SPEAKING BUT THEN
THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE HAUGHTINESS IN HER
BEARING AND COUNTENANCE
SHE HAD ROMAN FEATURES AND A DOUBLE CHIN
DISAPPEARING INTO A THROAT LIKE A PILLAR THESE FEATURES APPEARED TO ME
NOT ONLY INFLATED AND DARKENED BUT EVEN FURROWED WITH PRIDE AND THE
CHIN WAS SUSTAINED BY THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN A POSITION OF ALMOST
PRETERNATURAL ERECTNESS
SHE HAD LIKEWISE A FIERCE AND A HARD EYE IT
REMINDED ME OF MRS
REED'S SHE MOUTHED HER WORDS IN SPEAKING HER VOICE
WAS DEEP ITS INFLECTIONS VERY POMPOUS VERY DOGMATICAL VERY
INTOLERABLE IN SHORT
A CRIMSON VELVET ROBE AND A SHAWL TURBAN OF SOME
GOLD WROUGHT INDIAN FABRIC INVESTED HER I SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT WITH A
TRULY IMPERIAL DIGNITY
BLANCHE AND MARY WERE OF EQUAL STATURE STRAIGHT AND TALL AS POPLARS
MARY WAS TOO SLIM FOR HER HEIGHT BUT BLANCHE WAS MOULDED LIKE A DIAN
I
REGARDED HER OF COURSE WITH SPECIAL INTEREST
FIRST I WISHED TO SEE
WHETHER HER APPEARANCE ACCORDED WITH MRS
FAIRFAX'S DESCRIPTION
SECONDLY WHETHER IT AT ALL RESEMBLED THE FANCY MINIATURE I HAD PAINTED
OF HER AND THIRDLY IT WILL OUT WHETHER IT WERE SUCH AS I SHOULD FANCY
LIKELY TO SUIT MR
ROCHESTER'S TASTE
AS FAR AS PERSON WENT SHE ANSWERED POINT FOR POINT BOTH TO MY PICTURE
AND MRS
FAIRFAX'S DESCRIPTION
THE NOBLE BUST THE SLOPING SHOULDERS
THE GRACEFUL NECK THE DARK EYES AND BLACK RINGLETS WERE ALL THERE BUT
HER FACE HER FACE WAS LIKE HER MOTHER'S A YOUTHFUL UNFURROWED
LIKENESS THE SAME LOW BROW THE SAME HIGH FEATURES THE SAME PRIDE
IT
WAS NOT HOWEVER SO SATURNINE A PRIDE SHE LAUGHED CONTINUALLY HER
LAUGH WAS SATIRICAL AND SO WAS THE HABITUAL EXPRESSION OF HER ARCHED AND
HAUGHTY LIP
GENIUS IS SAID TO BE SELF CONSCIOUS
I CANNOT TELL WHETHER MISS INGRAM
WAS A GENIUS BUT SHE WAS SELF CONSCIOUS REMARKABLY SELF CONSCIOUS
INDEED
SHE ENTERED INTO A DISCOURSE ON BOTANY WITH THE GENTLE MRS
DENT
IT SEEMED MRS
DENT HAD NOT STUDIED THAT SCIENCE THOUGH AS SHE
SAID SHE LIKED FLOWERS ESPECIALLY WILD ONES MISS INGRAM HAD AND SHE
RAN OVER ITS VOCABULARY WITH AN AIR
I PRESENTLY PERCEIVED SHE WAS WHAT
IS VERNACULARLY TERMED TRAILING MRS
DENT THAT IS PLAYING ON HER
IGNORANCE HER TRAIL MIGHT BE CLEVER BUT IT WAS DECIDEDLY NOT GOOD
NATURED
SHE PLAYED HER EXECUTION WAS BRILLIANT SHE SANG HER VOICE
WAS FINE SHE TALKED FRENCH APART TO HER MAMMA AND SHE TALKED IT WELL
WITH FLUENCY AND WITH A GOOD ACCENT
MARY HAD A MILDER AND MORE OPEN COUNTENANCE THAN BLANCHE SOFTER FEATURES
TOO AND A SKIN SOME SHADES FAIRER MISS INGRAM WAS DARK AS A
SPANIARD BUT MARY WAS DEFICIENT IN LIFE HER FACE LACKED EXPRESSION
HER EYE LUSTRE SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY AND HAVING ONCE TAKEN HER SEAT
REMAINED FIXED LIKE A STATUE IN ITS NICHE
THE SISTERS WERE BOTH ATTIRED
IN SPOTLESS WHITE
AND DID I NOW THINK MISS INGRAM SUCH A CHOICE AS MR
ROCHESTER WOULD BE
LIKELY TO MAKE I COULD NOT TELL I DID NOT KNOW HIS TASTE IN FEMALE
BEAUTY
IF HE LIKED THE MAJESTIC SHE WAS THE VERY TYPE OF MAJESTY THEN
SHE WAS ACCOMPLISHED SPRIGHTLY
MOST GENTLEMEN WOULD ADMIRE HER I
THOUGHT AND THAT HE DID ADMIRE HER I ALREADY SEEMED TO HAVE OBTAINED
PROOF TO REMOVE THE LAST SHADE OF DOUBT IT REMAINED BUT TO SEE THEM
TOGETHER
YOU ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE READER THAT ADELE HAS ALL THIS TIME BEEN SITTING
MOTIONLESS ON THE STOOL AT MY FEET NO WHEN THE LADIES ENTERED SHE
ROSE ADVANCED TO MEET THEM MADE A STATELY REVERENCE AND SAID WITH
GRAVITY
BON JOUR MESDAMES
AND MISS INGRAM HAD LOOKED DOWN AT HER WITH A MOCKING AIR AND EXCLAIMED
OH WHAT A LITTLE PUPPET
LADY LYNN HAD REMARKED IT IS MR
ROCHESTER'S WARD I SUPPOSE THE
LITTLE FRENCH GIRL HE WAS SPEAKING OF
MRS
DENT HAD KINDLY TAKEN HER HAND AND GIVEN HER A KISS
AMY AND LOUISA ESHTON HAD CRIED OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY WHAT A LOVE OF A
CHILD
AND THEN THEY HAD CALLED HER TO A SOFA WHERE SHE NOW SAT ENSCONCED
BETWEEN THEM CHATTERING ALTERNATELY IN FRENCH AND BROKEN ENGLISH
ABSORBING NOT ONLY THE YOUNG LADIES' ATTENTION BUT THAT OF MRS
ESHTON
AND LADY LYNN AND GETTING SPOILT TO HER HEART'S CONTENT
AT LAST COFFEE IS BROUGHT IN AND THE GENTLEMEN ARE SUMMONED
I SIT IN
THE SHADE IF ANY SHADE THERE BE IN THIS BRILLIANTLY LIT APARTMENT THE
WINDOW CURTAIN HALF HIDES ME
AGAIN THE ARCH YAWNS THEY COME
THE
COLLECTIVE APPEARANCE OF THE GENTLEMEN LIKE THAT OF THE LADIES IS VERY
IMPOSING THEY ARE ALL COSTUMED IN BLACK MOST OF THEM ARE TALL SOME
YOUNG
HENRY AND FREDERICK LYNN ARE VERY DASHING SPARKS INDEED AND
COLONEL DENT IS A FINE SOLDIERLY MAN
MR
ESHTON THE MAGISTRATE OF THE
DISTRICT IS GENTLEMAN LIKE HIS HAIR IS QUITE WHITE HIS EYEBROWS AND
WHISKERS STILL DARK WHICH GIVES HIM SOMETHING OF THE APPEARANCE OF A
PERE NOBLE DE THEATRE LORD INGRAM LIKE HIS SISTERS IS VERY TALL
LIKE THEM ALSO HE IS HANDSOME BUT HE SHARES MARY'S APATHETIC AND
LISTLESS LOOK HE SEEMS TO HAVE MORE LENGTH OF LIMB THAN VIVACITY OF
BLOOD OR VIGOUR OF BRAIN
AND WHERE IS MR
ROCHESTER
HE COMES IN LAST I AM NOT LOOKING AT THE ARCH YET I SEE HIM ENTER
I
TRY TO CONCENTRATE MY ATTENTION ON THOSE NETTING NEEDLES ON THE MESHES
OF THE PURSE I AM FORMING I WISH TO THINK ONLY OF THE WORK I HAVE IN MY
HANDS TO SEE ONLY THE SILVER BEADS AND SILK THREADS THAT LIE IN MY LAP
WHEREAS I DISTINCTLY BEHOLD HIS FIGURE AND I INEVITABLY RECALL THE
MOMENT WHEN I LAST SAW IT JUST AFTER I HAD RENDERED HIM WHAT HE DEEMED
AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE AND HE HOLDING MY HAND AND LOOKING DOWN ON MY
FACE SURVEYED ME WITH EYES THAT REVEALED A HEART FULL AND EAGER TO
OVERFLOW IN WHOSE EMOTIONS I HAD A PART
HOW NEAR HAD I APPROACHED HIM
AT THAT MOMENT WHAT HAD OCCURRED SINCE CALCULATED TO CHANGE HIS AND MY
RELATIVE POSITIONS YET NOW HOW DISTANT HOW FAR ESTRANGED WE WERE SO
FAR ESTRANGED THAT I DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO COME AND SPEAK TO ME
I DID
NOT WONDER WHEN WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME HE TOOK A SEAT AT THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN CONVERSING WITH SOME OF THE LADIES
NO SOONER DID I SEE THAT HIS ATTENTION WAS RIVETED ON THEM AND THAT I
MIGHT GAZE WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED THAN MY EYES WERE DRAWN INVOLUNTARILY
TO HIS FACE I COULD NOT KEEP THEIR LIDS UNDER CONTROL THEY WOULD RISE
AND THE IRIDS WOULD FIX ON HIM
I LOOKED AND HAD AN ACUTE PLEASURE IN
LOOKING A PRECIOUS YET POIGNANT PLEASURE PURE GOLD WITH A STEELY
POINT OF AGONY A PLEASURE LIKE WHAT THE THIRST PERISHING MAN MIGHT FEEL
WHO KNOWS THE WELL TO WHICH HE HAS CREPT IS POISONED YET STOOPS AND
DRINKS DIVINE DRAUGHTS NEVERTHELESS
MOST TRUE IS IT THAT BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE GAZER MY MASTER'S
COLOURLESS OLIVE FACE SQUARE MASSIVE BROW BROAD AND JETTY EYEBROWS
DEEP EYES STRONG FEATURES FIRM GRIM MOUTH ALL ENERGY DECISION
WILL WERE NOT BEAUTIFUL ACCORDING TO RULE BUT THEY WERE MORE THAN
BEAUTIFUL TO ME THEY WERE FULL OF AN INTEREST AN INFLUENCE THAT QUITE
MASTERED ME THAT TOOK MY FEELINGS FROM MY OWN POWER AND FETTERED THEM
IN HIS
I HAD NOT INTENDED TO LOVE HIM THE READER KNOWS I HAD WROUGHT
HARD TO EXTIRPATE FROM MY SOUL THE GERMS OF LOVE THERE DETECTED AND NOW
AT THE FIRST RENEWED VIEW OF HIM THEY SPONTANEOUSLY ARRIVED GREEN AND
STRONG HE MADE ME LOVE HIM WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME
I COMPARED HIM WITH HIS GUESTS
WHAT WAS THE GALLANT GRACE OF THE LYNNS
THE LANGUID ELEGANCE OF LORD INGRAM EVEN THE MILITARY DISTINCTION OF
COLONEL DENT CONTRASTED WITH HIS LOOK OF NATIVE PITH AND GENUINE POWER
I HAD NO SYMPATHY IN THEIR APPEARANCE THEIR EXPRESSION YET I COULD
IMAGINE THAT MOST OBSERVERS WOULD CALL THEM ATTRACTIVE HANDSOME
IMPOSING WHILE THEY WOULD PRONOUNCE MR
ROCHESTER AT ONCE HARSH FEATURED
AND MELANCHOLY LOOKING
I SAW THEM SMILE LAUGH IT WAS NOTHING THE
LIGHT OF THE CANDLES HAD AS MUCH SOUL IN IT AS THEIR SMILE THE TINKLE OF
THE BELL AS MUCH SIGNIFICANCE AS THEIR LAUGH
I SAW MR
ROCHESTER
SMILE HIS STERN FEATURES SOFTENED HIS EYE GREW BOTH BRILLIANT AND
GENTLE ITS RAY BOTH SEARCHING AND SWEET
HE WAS TALKING AT THE MOMENT
TO LOUISA AND AMY ESHTON
I WONDERED TO SEE THEM RECEIVE WITH CALM THAT
LOOK WHICH SEEMED TO ME SO PENETRATING I EXPECTED THEIR EYES TO FALL
THEIR COLOUR TO RISE UNDER IT YET I WAS GLAD WHEN I FOUND THEY WERE IN
NO SENSE MOVED
HE IS NOT TO THEM WHAT HE IS TO ME I THOUGHT HE IS
NOT OF THEIR KIND
I BELIEVE HE IS OF MINE I AM SURE HE IS I FEEL
AKIN TO HIM I UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF HIS COUNTENANCE AND MOVEMENTS
THOUGH RANK AND WEALTH SEVER US WIDELY I HAVE SOMETHING IN MY BRAIN AND
HEART IN MY BLOOD AND NERVES THAT ASSIMILATES ME MENTALLY TO HIM
DID
I SAY A FEW DAYS SINCE THAT I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM BUT TO RECEIVE
MY SALARY AT HIS HANDS DID I FORBID MYSELF TO THINK OF HIM IN ANY OTHER
LIGHT THAN AS A PAYMASTER BLASPHEMY AGAINST NATURE EVERY GOOD TRUE
VIGOROUS FEELING I HAVE GATHERS IMPULSIVELY ROUND HIM
I KNOW I MUST
CONCEAL MY SENTIMENTS I MUST SMOTHER HOPE I MUST REMEMBER THAT HE
CANNOT CARE MUCH FOR ME
FOR WHEN I SAY THAT I AM OF HIS KIND I DO NOT
MEAN THAT I HAVE HIS FORCE TO INFLUENCE AND HIS SPELL TO ATTRACT I MEAN
ONLY THAT I HAVE CERTAIN TASTES AND FEELINGS IN COMMON WITH HIM
I MUST
THEN REPEAT CONTINUALLY THAT WE ARE FOR EVER SUNDERED AND YET WHILE I
BREATHE AND THINK I MUST LOVE HIM
COFFEE IS HANDED
THE LADIES SINCE THE GENTLEMEN ENTERED HAVE BECOME
LIVELY AS LARKS CONVERSATION WAXES BRISK AND MERRY
COLONEL DENT AND
MR
ESHTON ARGUE ON POLITICS THEIR WIVES LISTEN
THE TWO PROUD
DOWAGERS LADY LYNN AND LADY INGRAM CONFABULATE TOGETHER
SIR
GEORGE WHOM BY THE BYE I HAVE FORGOTTEN TO DESCRIBE A VERY BIG AND
VERY FRESH LOOKING COUNTRY GENTLEMAN STANDS BEFORE THEIR SOFA COFFEE
CUP IN HAND AND OCCASIONALLY PUTS IN A WORD
MR
FREDERICK LYNN HAS
TAKEN A SEAT BESIDE MARY INGRAM AND IS SHOWING HER THE ENGRAVINGS OF A
SPLENDID VOLUME SHE LOOKS SMILES NOW AND THEN BUT APPARENTLY SAYS
LITTLE
THE TALL AND PHLEGMATIC LORD INGRAM LEANS WITH FOLDED ARMS ON
THE CHAIR BACK OF THE LITTLE AND LIVELY AMY ESHTON SHE GLANCES UP AT
HIM AND CHATTERS LIKE A WREN SHE LIKES HIM BETTER THAN SHE DOES MR
ROCHESTER
HENRY LYNN HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF AN OTTOMAN AT THE FEET OF
LOUISA ADELE SHARES IT WITH HIM HE IS TRYING TO TALK FRENCH WITH HER
AND LOUISA LAUGHS AT HIS BLUNDERS
WITH WHOM WILL BLANCHE INGRAM PAIR
SHE IS STANDING ALONE AT THE TABLE BENDING GRACEFULLY OVER AN ALBUM
SHE
SEEMS WAITING TO BE SOUGHT BUT SHE WILL NOT WAIT TOO LONG SHE HERSELF
SELECTS A MATE
MR
ROCHESTER HAVING QUITTED THE ESHTONS STANDS ON THE HEARTH AS
SOLITARY AS SHE STANDS BY THE TABLE SHE CONFRONTS HIM TAKING HER
STATION ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MANTELPIECE
MR
ROCHESTER I THOUGHT YOU WERE NOT FOND OF CHILDREN
NOR AM I
THEN WHAT INDUCED YOU TO TAKE CHARGE OF SUCH A LITTLE DOLL AS THAT
POINTING TO ADELE
WHERE DID YOU PICK HER UP
I DID NOT PICK HER UP SHE WAS LEFT ON MY HANDS
YOU SHOULD HAVE SENT HER TO SCHOOL
I COULD NOT AFFORD IT SCHOOLS ARE SO DEAR
WHY I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A GOVERNESS FOR HER I SAW A PERSON WITH HER
JUST NOW IS SHE GONE OH NO THERE SHE IS STILL BEHIND THE WINDOW
CURTAIN
YOU PAY HER OF COURSE I SHOULD THINK IT QUITE AS
EXPENSIVE MORE SO FOR YOU HAVE THEM BOTH TO KEEP IN ADDITION
I FEARED OR SHOULD I SAY HOPED THE ALLUSION TO ME WOULD MAKE MR
ROCHESTER GLANCE MY WAY AND I INVOLUNTARILY SHRANK FARTHER INTO THE
SHADE BUT HE NEVER TURNED HIS EYES
I HAVE NOT CONSIDERED THE SUBJECT SAID HE INDIFFERENTLY LOOKING
STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
NO YOU MEN NEVER DO CONSIDER ECONOMY AND COMMON SENSE
YOU SHOULD HEAR
MAMA ON THE CHAPTER OF GOVERNESSES MARY AND I HAVE HAD I SHOULD THINK
A DOZEN AT LEAST IN OUR DAY HALF OF THEM DETESTABLE AND THE REST
RIDICULOUS AND ALL INCUBI WERE THEY NOT MAMA
DID YOU SPEAK MY OWN
THE YOUNG LADY THUS CLAIMED AS THE DOWAGER'S SPECIAL PROPERTY REITERATED
HER QUESTION WITH AN EXPLANATION
MY DEAREST DON'T MENTION GOVERNESSES THE WORD MAKES ME NERVOUS
I
HAVE SUFFERED A MARTYRDOM FROM THEIR INCOMPETENCY AND CAPRICE
I THANK
HEAVEN I HAVE NOW DONE WITH THEM
MRS
DENT HERE BENT OVER TO THE PIOUS LADY AND WHISPERED SOMETHING IN HER
EAR I SUPPOSE FROM THE ANSWER ELICITED IT WAS A REMINDER THAT ONE OF
THE ANATHEMATISED RACE WAS PRESENT
TANT PIS SAID HER LADYSHIP I HOPE IT MAY DO HER GOOD THEN IN A
LOWER TONE BUT STILL LOUD ENOUGH FOR ME TO HEAR I NOTICED HER I AM A
JUDGE OF PHYSIOGNOMY AND IN HERS I SEE ALL THE FAULTS OF HER CLASS
WHAT ARE THEY MADAM INQUIRED MR
ROCHESTER ALOUD
I WILL TELL YOU IN YOUR PRIVATE EAR REPLIED SHE WAGGING HER TURBAN
THREE TIMES WITH PORTENTOUS SIGNIFICANCY
BUT MY CURIOSITY WILL BE PAST ITS APPETITE IT CRAVES FOOD NOW
ASK BLANCHE SHE IS NEARER YOU THAN I
OH DON'T REFER HIM TO ME MAMA I HAVE JUST ONE WORD TO SAY OF THE
WHOLE TRIBE THEY ARE A NUISANCE
NOT THAT I EVER SUFFERED MUCH FROM
THEM I TOOK CARE TO TURN THE TABLES
WHAT TRICKS THEODORE AND I USED TO
PLAY ON OUR MISS WILSONS AND MRS
GREYS AND MADAME JOUBERTS MARY WAS
ALWAYS TOO SLEEPY TO JOIN IN A PLOT WITH SPIRIT
THE BEST FUN WAS WITH
MADAME JOUBERT MISS WILSON WAS A POOR SICKLY THING LACHRYMOSE AND LOW
SPIRITED NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE OF VANQUISHING IN SHORT AND MRS
GREY
WAS COARSE AND INSENSIBLE NO BLOW TOOK EFFECT ON HER
BUT POOR MADAME
JOUBERT I SEE HER YET IN HER RAGING PASSIONS WHEN WE HAD DRIVEN HER TO
EXTREMITIES SPILT OUR TEA CRUMBLED OUR BREAD AND BUTTER TOSSED OUR
BOOKS UP TO THE CEILING AND PLAYED A CHARIVARI WITH THE RULER AND DESK
THE FENDER AND FIRE IRONS
THEODORE DO YOU REMEMBER THOSE MERRY DAYS
YAAS TO BE SURE I DO DRAWLED LORD INGRAM AND THE POOR OLD STICK
USED TO CRY OUT 'OH YOU VILLAINS CHILDS AND THEN WE SERMONISED HER ON
THE PRESUMPTION OF ATTEMPTING TO TEACH SUCH CLEVER BLADES AS WE WERE
WHEN SHE WAS HERSELF SO IGNORANT
WE DID AND TEDO YOU KNOW I HELPED YOU IN PROSECUTING OR
PERSECUTING YOUR TUTOR WHEY FACED MR
VINING THE PARSON IN THE PIP AS
WE USED TO CALL HIM
HE AND MISS WILSON TOOK THE LIBERTY OF FALLING IN
LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AT LEAST TEDO AND I THOUGHT SO WE SURPRISED SUNDRY
TENDER GLANCES AND SIGHS WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS TOKENS OF 'LA BELLE
PASSION AND I PROMISE YOU THE PUBLIC SOON HAD THE BENEFIT OF OUR
DISCOVERY WE EMPLOYED IT AS A SORT OF LEVER TO HOIST OUR DEAD WEIGHTS
FROM THE HOUSE
DEAR MAMA THERE AS SOON AS SHE GOT AN INKLING OF THE
BUSINESS FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS OF AN IMMORAL TENDENCY
DID YOU NOT MY
LADY MOTHER
CERTAINLY MY BEST
AND I WAS QUITE RIGHT DEPEND ON THAT THERE ARE A
THOUSAND REASONS WHY LIAISONS BETWEEN GOVERNESSES AND TUTORS SHOULD NEVER
BE TOLERATED A MOMENT IN ANY WELL REGULATED HOUSE FIRSTLY
OH GRACIOUS MAMA SPARE US THE ENUMERATION AU RESTE WE ALL KNOW
THEM DANGER OF BAD EXAMPLE TO INNOCENCE OF CHILDHOOD DISTRACTIONS AND
CONSEQUENT NEGLECT OF DUTY ON THE PART OF THE ATTACHED MUTUAL ALLIANCE
AND RELIANCE CONFIDENCE THENCE RESULTING INSOLENCE ACCOMPANYING MUTINY
AND GENERAL BLOW UP
AM I RIGHT BARONESS INGRAM OF INGRAM PARK
MY LILY FLOWER YOU ARE RIGHT NOW AS ALWAYS
THEN NO MORE NEED BE SAID CHANGE THE SUBJECT
AMY ESHTON NOT HEARING OR NOT HEEDING THIS DICTUM JOINED IN WITH HER
SOFT INFANTINE TONE LOUISA AND I USED TO QUIZ OUR GOVERNESS TOO BUT
SHE WAS SUCH A GOOD CREATURE SHE WOULD BEAR ANYTHING NOTHING PUT HER
OUT
SHE WAS NEVER CROSS WITH US WAS SHE LOUISA
NO NEVER WE MIGHT DO WHAT WE PLEASED RANSACK HER DESK AND HER
WORKBOX AND TURN HER DRAWERS INSIDE OUT AND SHE WAS SO GOOD NATURED
SHE WOULD GIVE US ANYTHING WE ASKED FOR
I SUPPOSE NOW SAID MISS INGRAM CURLING HER LIP SARCASTICALLY WE
SHALL HAVE AN ABSTRACT OF THE MEMOIRS OF ALL THE GOVERNESSES EXTANT IN
ORDER TO AVERT SUCH A VISITATION I AGAIN MOVE THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW
TOPIC
MR
ROCHESTER DO YOU SECOND MY MOTION
MADAM I SUPPORT YOU ON THIS POINT AS ON EVERY OTHER
THEN ON ME BE THE ONUS OF BRINGING IT FORWARD
SIGNIOR EDUARDO ARE YOU
IN VOICE TO NIGHT
DONNA BIANCA IF YOU COMMAND IT I WILL BE
THEN SIGNIOR I LAY ON YOU MY SOVEREIGN BEHEST TO FURBISH UP YOUR LUNGS
AND OTHER VOCAL ORGANS AS THEY WILL BE WANTED ON MY ROYAL SERVICE
WHO WOULD NOT BE THE RIZZIO OF SO DIVINE A MARY
A FIG FOR RIZZIO CRIED SHE TOSSING HER HEAD WITH ALL ITS CURLS AS
SHE MOVED TO THE PIANO
IT IS MY OPINION THE FIDDLER DAVID MUST HAVE
BEEN AN INSIPID SORT OF FELLOW I LIKE BLACK BOTHWELL BETTER TO MY MIND
A MAN IS NOTHING WITHOUT A SPICE OF THE DEVIL IN HIM AND HISTORY MAY SAY
WHAT IT WILL OF JAMES HEPBURN BUT I HAVE A NOTION HE WAS JUST THE SORT
OF WILD FIERCE BANDIT HERO WHOM I COULD HAVE CONSENTED TO GIFT WITH MY
HAND
GENTLEMEN YOU HEAR NOW WHICH OF YOU MOST RESEMBLES BOTHWELL CRIED
MR
ROCHESTER
I SHOULD SAY THE PREFERENCE LIES WITH YOU RESPONDED COLONEL DENT
ON MY HONOUR I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU WAS THE REPLY
MISS INGRAM WHO HAD NOW SEATED HERSELF WITH PROUD GRACE AT THE PIANO
SPREADING OUT HER SNOWY ROBES IN QUEENLY AMPLITUDE COMMENCED A BRILLIANT
PRELUDE TALKING MEANTIME
SHE APPEARED TO BE ON HER HIGH HORSE
TO NIGHT BOTH HER WORDS AND HER AIR SEEMED INTENDED TO EXCITE NOT ONLY
THE ADMIRATION BUT THE AMAZEMENT OF HER AUDITORS SHE WAS EVIDENTLY BENT
ON STRIKING THEM AS SOMETHING VERY DASHING AND DARING INDEED
OH I AM SO SICK OF THE YOUNG MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY EXCLAIMED SHE
RATTLING AWAY AT THE INSTRUMENT
POOR PUNY THINGS NOT FIT TO STIR A
STEP BEYOND PAPA'S PARK GATES NOR TO GO EVEN SO FAR WITHOUT MAMA'S
PERMISSION AND GUARDIANSHIP CREATURES SO ABSORBED IN CARE ABOUT THEIR
PRETTY FACES AND THEIR WHITE HANDS AND THEIR SMALL FEET AS IF A MAN
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH BEAUTY AS IF LOVELINESS WERE NOT THE SPECIAL
PREROGATIVE OF WOMAN HER LEGITIMATE APPANAGE AND HERITAGE I GRANT AN
UGLY WOMAN IS A BLOT ON THE FAIR FACE OF CREATION BUT AS TO THE
GENTLEMEN LET THEM BE SOLICITOUS TO POSSESS ONLY STRENGTH AND VALOUR
LET THEIR MOTTO BE HUNT SHOOT AND FIGHT THE REST IS NOT WORTH A
FILLIP
SUCH SHOULD BE MY DEVICE WERE I A MAN
WHENEVER I MARRY SHE CONTINUED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH NONE INTERRUPTED
I AM RESOLVED MY HUSBAND SHALL NOT BE A RIVAL BUT A FOIL TO ME
I WILL
SUFFER NO COMPETITOR NEAR THE THRONE I SHALL EXACT AN UNDIVIDED HOMAGE
HIS DEVOTIONS SHALL NOT BE SHARED BETWEEN ME AND THE SHAPE HE SEES IN HIS
MIRROR
MR
ROCHESTER NOW SING AND I WILL PLAY FOR YOU
I AM ALL OBEDIENCE WAS THE RESPONSE
HERE THEN IS A CORSAIR SONG
KNOW THAT I DOAT ON CORSAIRS AND FOR THAT
REASON SING IT CON SPIRITO
COMMANDS FROM MISS INGRAM'S LIPS WOULD PUT SPIRIT INTO A MUG OF MILK AND
WATER
TAKE CARE THEN IF YOU DON'T PLEASE ME I WILL SHAME YOU BY SHOWING HOW
SUCH THINGS SHOULD BE DONE
THAT IS OFFERING A PREMIUM ON INCAPACITY I SHALL NOW ENDEAVOUR TO
FAIL
GARDEZ VOUS EN BIEN IF YOU ERR WILFULLY I SHALL DEVISE A
PROPORTIONATE PUNISHMENT
MISS INGRAM OUGHT TO BE CLEMENT FOR SHE HAS IT IN HER POWER TO INFLICT
A CHASTISEMENT BEYOND MORTAL ENDURANCE
HA EXPLAIN COMMANDED THE LADY
PARDON ME MADAM NO NEED OF EXPLANATION YOUR OWN FINE SENSE MUST
INFORM YOU THAT ONE OF YOUR FROWNS WOULD BE A SUFFICIENT SUBSTITUTE FOR
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
SING SAID SHE AND AGAIN TOUCHING THE PIANO SHE COMMENCED AN
ACCOMPANIMENT IN SPIRITED STYLE
NOW IS MY TIME TO SLIP AWAY THOUGHT I BUT THE TONES THAT THEN SEVERED
THE AIR ARRESTED ME
MRS
FAIRFAX HAD SAID MR
ROCHESTER POSSESSED A
FINE VOICE HE DID A MELLOW POWERFUL BASS INTO WHICH HE THREW HIS OWN
FEELING HIS OWN FORCE FINDING A WAY THROUGH THE EAR TO THE HEART AND
THERE WAKING SENSATION STRANGELY
I WAITED TILL THE LAST DEEP AND FULL
VIBRATION HAD EXPIRED TILL THE TIDE OF TALK CHECKED AN INSTANT HAD
RESUMED ITS FLOW I THEN QUITTED MY SHELTERED CORNER AND MADE MY EXIT BY
THE SIDE DOOR WHICH WAS FORTUNATELY NEAR
THENCE A NARROW PASSAGE LED
INTO THE HALL IN CROSSING IT I PERCEIVED MY SANDAL WAS LOOSE I STOPPED
TO TIE IT KNEELING DOWN FOR THAT PURPOSE ON THE MAT AT THE FOOT OF THE
STAIRCASE
I HEARD THE DINING ROOM DOOR UNCLOSE A GENTLEMAN CAME OUT
RISING HASTILY I STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH HIM IT WAS MR
ROCHESTER
HOW DO YOU DO HE ASKED
I AM VERY WELL SIR
WHY DID YOU NOT COME AND SPEAK TO ME IN THE ROOM
I THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE RETORTED THE QUESTION ON HIM WHO PUT IT BUT I
WOULD NOT TAKE THAT FREEDOM
I ANSWERED
I DID NOT WISH TO DISTURB YOU AS YOU SEEMED ENGAGED SIR
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING DURING MY ABSENCE
NOTHING PARTICULAR TEACHING ADELE AS USUAL
AND GETTING A GOOD DEAL PALER THAN YOU WERE AS I SAW AT FIRST SIGHT
WHAT IS THE MATTER
NOTHING AT ALL SIR
DID YOU TAKE ANY COLD THAT NIGHT YOU HALF DROWNED ME
NOT THE LEAST
RETURN TO THE DRAWING ROOM YOU ARE DESERTING TOO EARLY
I AM TIRED SIR
HE LOOKED AT ME FOR A MINUTE
AND A LITTLE DEPRESSED HE SAID
WHAT ABOUT TELL ME
NOTHING NOTHING SIR
I AM NOT DEPRESSED
BUT I AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE SO MUCH DEPRESSED THAT A FEW MORE WORDS WOULD
BRING TEARS TO YOUR EYES INDEED THEY ARE THERE NOW SHINING AND
SWIMMING AND A BEAD HAS SLIPPED FROM THE LASH AND FALLEN ON TO THE FLAG
IF I HAD TIME AND WAS NOT IN MORTAL DREAD OF SOME PRATING PRIG OF A
SERVANT PASSING I WOULD KNOW WHAT ALL THIS MEANS
WELL TO NIGHT I
EXCUSE YOU BUT UNDERSTAND THAT SO LONG AS MY VISITORS STAY I EXPECT YOU
TO APPEAR IN THE DRAWING ROOM EVERY EVENING IT IS MY WISH DON'T NEGLECT
IT
NOW GO AND SEND SOPHIE FOR ADELE
GOOD NIGHT MY HE STOPPED
BIT HIS LIP AND ABRUPTLY LEFT ME
CHAPTER XVIII
MERRY DAYS WERE THESE AT THORNFIELD HALL AND BUSY DAYS TOO HOW
DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF STILLNESS MONOTONY AND
SOLITUDE I HAD PASSED BENEATH ITS ROOF ALL SAD FEELINGS SEEMED NOW
DRIVEN FROM THE HOUSE ALL GLOOMY ASSOCIATIONS FORGOTTEN THERE WAS LIFE
EVERYWHERE MOVEMENT ALL DAY LONG
YOU COULD NOT NOW TRAVERSE THE
GALLERY ONCE SO HUSHED NOR ENTER THE FRONT CHAMBERS ONCE SO
TENANTLESS WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING A SMART LADY'S MAID OR A DANDY VALET
THE KITCHEN THE BUTLER'S PANTRY THE SERVANTS' HALL THE ENTRANCE HALL
WERE EQUALLY ALIVE AND THE SALOONS WERE ONLY LEFT VOID AND STILL WHEN
THE BLUE SKY AND HALCYON SUNSHINE OF THE GENIAL SPRING WEATHER CALLED
THEIR OCCUPANTS OUT INTO THE GROUNDS
EVEN WHEN THAT WEATHER WAS BROKEN
AND CONTINUOUS RAIN SET IN FOR SOME DAYS NO DAMP SEEMED CAST OVER
ENJOYMENT INDOOR AMUSEMENTS ONLY BECAME MORE LIVELY AND VARIED IN
CONSEQUENCE OF THE STOP PUT TO OUTDOOR GAIETY
I WONDERED WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO THE FIRST EVENING A CHANGE OF
ENTERTAINMENT WAS PROPOSED THEY SPOKE OF PLAYING CHARADES BUT IN MY
IGNORANCE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TERM
THE SERVANTS WERE CALLED IN
THE DINING ROOM TABLES WHEELED AWAY THE LIGHTS OTHERWISE DISPOSED THE
CHAIRS PLACED IN A SEMICIRCLE OPPOSITE THE ARCH
WHILE MR
ROCHESTER AND
THE OTHER GENTLEMEN DIRECTED THESE ALTERATIONS THE LADIES WERE RUNNING
UP AND DOWN STAIRS RINGING FOR THEIR MAIDS
MRS
FAIRFAX WAS SUMMONED TO
GIVE INFORMATION RESPECTING THE RESOURCES OF THE HOUSE IN SHAWLS
DRESSES DRAPERIES OF ANY KIND AND CERTAIN WARDROBES OF THE THIRD STOREY
WERE RANSACKED AND THEIR CONTENTS IN THE SHAPE OF BROCADED AND HOOPED
PETTICOATS SATIN SACQUES BLACK MODES LACE LAPPETS C WERE BROUGHT
DOWN IN ARMFULS BY THE ABIGAILS THEN A SELECTION WAS MADE AND SUCH
THINGS AS WERE CHOSEN WERE CARRIED TO THE BOUDOIR WITHIN THE
DRAWING ROOM
MEANTIME MR
ROCHESTER HAD AGAIN SUMMONED THE LADIES ROUND HIM AND WAS
SELECTING CERTAIN OF THEIR NUMBER TO BE OF HIS PARTY
MISS INGRAM IS
MINE OF COURSE SAID HE AFTERWARDS HE NAMED THE TWO MISSES ESHTON AND
MRS
DENT
HE LOOKED AT ME I HAPPENED TO BE NEAR HIM AS I HAD BEEN
FASTENING THE CLASP OF MRS
DENT'S BRACELET WHICH HAD GOT LOOSE
WILL YOU PLAY HE ASKED
I SHOOK MY HEAD
HE DID NOT INSIST WHICH I
RATHER FEARED HE WOULD HAVE DONE HE ALLOWED ME TO RETURN QUIETLY TO MY
USUAL SEAT
HE AND HIS AIDS NOW WITHDREW BEHIND THE CURTAIN THE OTHER PARTY WHICH
WAS HEADED BY COLONEL DENT SAT DOWN ON THE CRESCENT OF CHAIRS
ONE OF
THE GENTLEMEN MR
ESHTON OBSERVING ME SEEMED TO PROPOSE THAT I SHOULD
BE ASKED TO JOIN THEM BUT LADY INGRAM INSTANTLY NEGATIVED THE NOTION
NO I HEARD HER SAY SHE LOOKS TOO STUPID FOR ANY GAME OF THE SORT
ERE LONG A BELL TINKLED AND THE CURTAIN DREW UP
WITHIN THE ARCH THE
BULKY FIGURE OF SIR GEORGE LYNN WHOM MR
ROCHESTER HAD LIKEWISE CHOSEN
WAS SEEN ENVELOPED IN A WHITE SHEET BEFORE HIM ON A TABLE LAY OPEN A
LARGE BOOK AND AT HIS SIDE STOOD AMY ESHTON DRAPED IN MR
ROCHESTER'S
CLOAK AND HOLDING A BOOK IN HER HAND
SOMEBODY UNSEEN RANG THE BELL
MERRILY THEN ADELE WHO HAD INSISTED ON BEING ONE OF HER GUARDIAN'S
PARTY BOUNDED FORWARD SCATTERING ROUND HER THE CONTENTS OF A BASKET OF
FLOWERS SHE CARRIED ON HER ARM
THEN APPEARED THE MAGNIFICENT FIGURE OF
MISS INGRAM CLAD IN WHITE A LONG VEIL ON HER HEAD AND A WREATH OF
ROSES ROUND HER BROW BY HER SIDE WALKED MR
ROCHESTER AND TOGETHER THEY
DREW NEAR THE TABLE
THEY KNELT WHILE MRS
DENT AND LOUISA ESHTON
DRESSED ALSO IN WHITE TOOK UP THEIR STATIONS BEHIND THEM
A CEREMONY
FOLLOWED IN DUMB SHOW IN WHICH IT WAS EASY TO RECOGNISE THE PANTOMIME
OF A MARRIAGE
AT ITS TERMINATION COLONEL DENT AND HIS PARTY CONSULTED
IN WHISPERS FOR TWO MINUTES THEN THE COLONEL CALLED OUT
BRIDE MR
ROCHESTER BOWED AND THE CURTAIN FELL
A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL ELAPSED BEFORE IT AGAIN ROSE
ITS SECOND RISING
DISPLAYED A MORE ELABORATELY PREPARED SCENE THAN THE LAST
THE DRAWING
ROOM AS I HAVE BEFORE OBSERVED WAS RAISED TWO STEPS ABOVE THE DINING
ROOM AND ON THE TOP OF THE UPPER STEP PLACED A YARD OR TWO BACK WITHIN
THE ROOM APPEARED A LARGE MARBLE BASIN WHICH I RECOGNISED AS AN
ORNAMENT OF THE CONSERVATORY WHERE IT USUALLY STOOD SURROUNDED BY
EXOTICS AND TENANTED BY GOLD FISH AND WHENCE IT MUST HAVE BEEN
TRANSPORTED WITH SOME TROUBLE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS SIZE AND WEIGHT
SEATED ON THE CARPET BY THE SIDE OF THIS BASIN WAS SEEN MR
ROCHESTER
COSTUMED IN SHAWLS WITH A TURBAN ON HIS HEAD
HIS DARK EYES AND SWARTHY
SKIN AND PAYNIM FEATURES SUITED THE COSTUME EXACTLY HE LOOKED THE VERY
MODEL OF AN EASTERN EMIR AN AGENT OR A VICTIM OF THE BOWSTRING
PRESENTLY ADVANCED INTO VIEW MISS INGRAM
SHE TOO WAS ATTIRED IN
ORIENTAL FASHION A CRIMSON SCARF TIED SASH LIKE ROUND THE WAIST AN
EMBROIDERED HANDKERCHIEF KNOTTED ABOUT HER TEMPLES HER
BEAUTIFULLY MOULDED ARMS BARE ONE OF THEM UPRAISED IN THE ACT OF
SUPPORTING A PITCHER POISED GRACEFULLY ON HER HEAD
BOTH HER CAST OF
FORM AND FEATURE HER COMPLEXION AND HER GENERAL AIR SUGGESTED THE IDEA
OF SOME ISRAELITISH PRINCESS OF THE PATRIARCHAL DAYS AND SUCH WAS
DOUBTLESS THE CHARACTER SHE INTENDED TO REPRESENT
SHE APPROACHED THE BASIN AND BENT OVER IT AS IF TO FILL HER PITCHER SHE
AGAIN LIFTED IT TO HER HEAD
THE PERSONAGE ON THE WELL BRINK NOW SEEMED
TO ACCOST HER TO MAKE SOME REQUEST SHE HASTED LET DOWN HER PITCHER
ON HER HAND AND GAVE HIM TO DRINK FROM THE BOSOM OF HIS ROBE HE THEN
PRODUCED A CASKET OPENED IT AND SHOWED MAGNIFICENT BRACELETS AND
EARRINGS SHE ACTED ASTONISHMENT AND ADMIRATION KNEELING HE LAID THE
TREASURE AT HER FEET INCREDULITY AND DELIGHT WERE EXPRESSED BY HER LOOKS
AND GESTURES THE STRANGER FASTENED THE BRACELETS ON HER ARMS AND THE
RINGS IN HER EARS
IT WAS ELIEZER AND REBECCA THE CAMELS ONLY WERE
WANTING
THE DIVINING PARTY AGAIN LAID THEIR HEADS TOGETHER APPARENTLY THEY COULD
NOT AGREE ABOUT THE WORD OR SYLLABLE THE SCENE ILLUSTRATED
COLONEL
DENT THEIR SPOKESMAN DEMANDED THE TABLEAU OF THE WHOLE WHEREUPON THE
CURTAIN AGAIN DESCENDED
ON ITS THIRD RISING ONLY A PORTION OF THE DRAWING ROOM WAS DISCLOSED THE
REST BEING CONCEALED BY A SCREEN HUNG WITH SOME SORT OF DARK AND COARSE
DRAPERY
THE MARBLE BASIN WAS REMOVED IN ITS PLACE STOOD A DEAL TABLE
AND A KITCHEN CHAIR THESE OBJECTS WERE VISIBLE BY A VERY DIM LIGHT
PROCEEDING FROM A HORN LANTERN THE WAX CANDLES BEING ALL EXTINGUISHED
AMIDST THIS SORDID SCENE SAT A MAN WITH HIS CLENCHED HANDS RESTING ON
HIS KNEES AND HIS EYES BENT ON THE GROUND
I KNEW MR
ROCHESTER THOUGH
THE BEGRIMED FACE THE DISORDERED DRESS HIS COAT HANGING LOOSE FROM ONE
ARM AS IF IT HAD BEEN ALMOST TORN FROM HIS BACK IN A SCUFFLE THE
DESPERATE AND SCOWLING COUNTENANCE THE ROUGH BRISTLING HAIR MIGHT WELL
HAVE DISGUISED HIM
AS HE MOVED A CHAIN CLANKED TO HIS WRISTS WERE
ATTACHED FETTERS
BRIDEWELL EXCLAIMED COLONEL DENT AND THE CHARADE WAS SOLVED
A SUFFICIENT INTERVAL HAVING ELAPSED FOR THE PERFORMERS TO RESUME THEIR
ORDINARY COSTUME THEY RE ENTERED THE DINING ROOM
MR
ROCHESTER LED IN
MISS INGRAM SHE WAS COMPLIMENTING HIM ON HIS ACTING
DO YOU KNOW SAID SHE THAT OF THE THREE CHARACTERS I LIKED YOU IN
THE LAST BEST OH HAD YOU BUT LIVED A FEW YEARS EARLIER WHAT A GALLANT
GENTLEMAN HIGHWAYMAN YOU WOULD HAVE MADE
IS ALL THE SOOT WASHED FROM MY FACE HE ASKED TURNING IT TOWARDS HER
ALAS YES THE MORE'S THE PITY NOTHING COULD BE MORE BECOMING TO YOUR
COMPLEXION THAN THAT RUFFIAN'S ROUGE
YOU WOULD LIKE A HERO OF THE ROAD THEN
AN ENGLISH HERO OF THE ROAD WOULD BE THE NEXT BEST THING TO AN ITALIAN
BANDIT AND THAT COULD ONLY BE SURPASSED BY A LEVANTINE PIRATE
WELL WHATEVER I AM REMEMBER YOU ARE MY WIFE WE WERE MARRIED AN HOUR
SINCE IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THESE WITNESSES SHE GIGGLED AND HER
COLOUR ROSE
NOW DENT CONTINUED MR
ROCHESTER IT IS YOUR TURN AND AS THE
OTHER PARTY WITHDREW HE AND HIS BAND TOOK THE VACATED SEATS
MISS
INGRAM PLACED HERSELF AT HER LEADER'S RIGHT HAND THE OTHER DIVINERS
FILLED THE CHAIRS ON EACH SIDE OF HIM AND HER
I DID NOT NOW WATCH THE
ACTORS I NO LONGER WAITED WITH INTEREST FOR THE CURTAIN TO RISE MY
ATTENTION WAS ABSORBED BY THE SPECTATORS MY EYES EREWHILE FIXED ON THE
ARCH WERE NOW IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED TO THE SEMICIRCLE OF CHAIRS
WHAT
CHARADE COLONEL DENT AND HIS PARTY PLAYED WHAT WORD THEY CHOSE HOW THEY
ACQUITTED THEMSELVES I NO LONGER REMEMBER BUT I STILL SEE THE
CONSULTATION WHICH FOLLOWED EACH SCENE I SEE MR
ROCHESTER TURN TO MISS
INGRAM AND MISS INGRAM TO HIM I SEE HER INCLINE HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM
TILL THE JETTY CURLS ALMOST TOUCH HIS SHOULDER AND WAVE AGAINST HIS
CHEEK I HEAR THEIR MUTUAL WHISPERINGS I RECALL THEIR INTERCHANGED
GLANCES AND SOMETHING EVEN OF THE FEELING ROUSED BY THE SPECTACLE
RETURNS IN MEMORY AT THIS MOMENT
I HAVE TOLD YOU READER THAT I HAD LEARNT TO LOVE MR
ROCHESTER I COULD
NOT UNLOVE HIM NOW MERELY BECAUSE I FOUND THAT HE HAD CEASED TO NOTICE
ME BECAUSE I MIGHT PASS HOURS IN HIS PRESENCE AND HE WOULD NEVER ONCE
TURN HIS EYES IN MY DIRECTION BECAUSE I SAW ALL HIS ATTENTIONS
APPROPRIATED BY A GREAT LADY WHO SCORNED TO TOUCH ME WITH THE HEM OF HER
ROBES AS SHE PASSED WHO IF EVER HER DARK AND IMPERIOUS EYE FELL ON ME
BY CHANCE WOULD WITHDRAW IT INSTANTLY AS FROM AN OBJECT TOO MEAN TO
MERIT OBSERVATION
I COULD NOT UNLOVE HIM BECAUSE I FELT SURE HE WOULD
SOON MARRY THIS VERY LADY BECAUSE I READ DAILY IN HER A PROUD SECURITY
IN HIS INTENTIONS RESPECTING HER BECAUSE I WITNESSED HOURLY IN HIM A
STYLE OF COURTSHIP WHICH IF CARELESS AND CHOOSING RATHER TO BE SOUGHT
THAN TO SEEK WAS YET IN ITS VERY CARELESSNESS CAPTIVATING AND IN ITS
VERY PRIDE IRRESISTIBLE
THERE WAS NOTHING TO COOL OR BANISH LOVE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THOUGH
MUCH TO CREATE DESPAIR
MUCH TOO YOU WILL THINK READER TO ENGENDER
JEALOUSY IF A WOMAN IN MY POSITION COULD PRESUME TO BE JEALOUS OF A
WOMAN IN MISS INGRAM'S
BUT I WAS NOT JEALOUS OR VERY RARELY THE
NATURE OF THE PAIN I SUFFERED COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED BY THAT WORD
MISS
INGRAM WAS A MARK BENEATH JEALOUSY SHE WAS TOO INFERIOR TO EXCITE THE
FEELING
PARDON THE SEEMING PARADOX I MEAN WHAT I SAY
SHE WAS VERY
SHOWY BUT SHE WAS NOT GENUINE SHE HAD A FINE PERSON MANY BRILLIANT
ATTAINMENTS BUT HER MIND WAS POOR HER HEART BARREN BY NATURE NOTHING
BLOOMED SPONTANEOUSLY ON THAT SOIL NO UNFORCED NATURAL FRUIT DELIGHTED
BY ITS FRESHNESS
SHE WAS NOT GOOD SHE WAS NOT ORIGINAL SHE USED TO
REPEAT SOUNDING PHRASES FROM BOOKS SHE NEVER OFFERED NOR HAD AN
OPINION OF HER OWN
SHE ADVOCATED A HIGH TONE OF SENTIMENT BUT SHE DID
NOT KNOW THE SENSATIONS OF SYMPATHY AND PITY TENDERNESS AND TRUTH WERE
NOT IN HER
TOO OFTEN SHE BETRAYED THIS BY THE UNDUE VENT SHE GAVE TO A
SPITEFUL ANTIPATHY SHE HAD CONCEIVED AGAINST LITTLE ADELE PUSHING HER
AWAY WITH SOME CONTUMELIOUS EPITHET IF SHE HAPPENED TO APPROACH HER
SOMETIMES ORDERING HER FROM THE ROOM AND ALWAYS TREATING HER WITH
COLDNESS AND ACRIMONY
OTHER EYES BESIDES MINE WATCHED THESE
MANIFESTATIONS OF CHARACTER WATCHED THEM CLOSELY KEENLY SHREWDLY
YES
THE FUTURE BRIDEGROOM MR
ROCHESTER HIMSELF EXERCISED OVER HIS INTENDED
A CEASELESS SURVEILLANCE AND IT WAS FROM THIS SAGACITY THIS GUARDEDNESS
OF HIS THIS PERFECT CLEAR CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS FAIR ONE'S DEFECTS THIS
OBVIOUS ABSENCE OF PASSION IN HIS SENTIMENTS TOWARDS HER THAT MY EVER
TORTURING PAIN AROSE
I SAW HE WAS GOING TO MARRY HER FOR FAMILY PERHAPS POLITICAL REASONS
BECAUSE HER RANK AND CONNECTIONS SUITED HIM I FELT HE HAD NOT GIVEN HER
HIS LOVE AND THAT HER QUALIFICATIONS WERE ILL ADAPTED TO WIN FROM HIM
THAT TREASURE
THIS WAS THE POINT THIS WAS WHERE THE NERVE WAS TOUCHED
AND TEASED THIS WAS WHERE THE FEVER WAS SUSTAINED AND FED SHE COULD
NOT CHARM HIM
IF SHE HAD MANAGED THE VICTORY AT ONCE AND HE HAD YIELDED AND SINCERELY
LAID HIS HEART AT HER FEET I SHOULD HAVE COVERED MY FACE TURNED TO THE
WALL AND FIGURATIVELY HAVE DIED TO THEM
IF MISS INGRAM HAD BEEN A
GOOD AND NOBLE WOMAN ENDOWED WITH FORCE FERVOUR KINDNESS SENSE I
SHOULD HAVE HAD ONE VITAL STRUGGLE WITH TWO TIGERS JEALOUSY AND DESPAIR
THEN MY HEART TORN OUT AND DEVOURED I SHOULD HAVE ADMIRED
HER ACKNOWLEDGED HER EXCELLENCE AND BEEN QUIET FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS
AND THE MORE ABSOLUTE HER SUPERIORITY THE DEEPER WOULD HAVE BEEN MY
ADMIRATION THE MORE TRULY TRANQUIL MY QUIESCENCE
BUT AS MATTERS REALLY
STOOD TO WATCH MISS INGRAM'S EFFORTS AT FASCINATING MR
ROCHESTER TO
WITNESS THEIR REPEATED FAILURE HERSELF UNCONSCIOUS THAT THEY DID FAIL
VAINLY FANCYING THAT EACH SHAFT LAUNCHED HIT THE MARK AND INFATUATEDLY
PLUMING HERSELF ON SUCCESS WHEN HER PRIDE AND SELF COMPLACENCY REPELLED
FURTHER AND FURTHER WHAT SHE WISHED TO ALLURE TO WITNESS THIS WAS TO
BE AT ONCE UNDER CEASELESS EXCITATION AND RUTHLESS RESTRAINT
BECAUSE WHEN SHE FAILED I SAW HOW SHE MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED
ARROWS
THAT CONTINUALLY GLANCED OFF FROM MR
ROCHESTER'S BREAST AND FELL
HARMLESS AT HIS FEET MIGHT I KNEW IF SHOT BY A SURER HAND HAVE
QUIVERED KEEN IN HIS PROUD HEART HAVE CALLED LOVE INTO HIS STERN EYE
AND SOFTNESS INTO HIS SARDONIC FACE OR BETTER STILL WITHOUT WEAPONS A
SILENT CONQUEST MIGHT HAVE BEEN WON
WHY CAN SHE NOT INFLUENCE HIM MORE WHEN SHE IS PRIVILEGED TO DRAW SO
NEAR TO HIM I ASKED MYSELF
SURELY SHE CANNOT TRULY LIKE HIM OR NOT
LIKE HIM WITH TRUE AFFECTION IF SHE DID SHE NEED NOT COIN HER SMILES
SO LAVISHLY FLASH HER GLANCES SO UNREMITTINGLY MANUFACTURE AIRS SO
ELABORATE GRACES SO MULTITUDINOUS
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SHE MIGHT BY
MERELY SITTING QUIETLY AT HIS SIDE SAYING LITTLE AND LOOKING LESS GET
NIGHER HIS HEART
I HAVE SEEN IN HIS FACE A FAR DIFFERENT EXPRESSION
FROM THAT WHICH HARDENS IT NOW WHILE SHE IS SO VIVACIOUSLY ACCOSTING HIM
BUT THEN IT CAME OF ITSELF IT WAS NOT ELICITED BY MERETRICIOUS ARTS AND
CALCULATED MANOEUVRES AND ONE HAD BUT TO ACCEPT IT TO ANSWER WHAT HE
ASKED WITHOUT PRETENSION TO ADDRESS HIM WHEN NEEDFUL WITHOUT GRIMACE AND
IT INCREASED AND GREW KINDER AND MORE GENIAL AND WARMED ONE LIKE A
FOSTERING SUNBEAM
HOW WILL SHE MANAGE TO PLEASE HIM WHEN THEY ARE
MARRIED I DO NOT THINK SHE WILL MANAGE IT AND YET IT MIGHT BE MANAGED
AND HIS WIFE MIGHT I VERILY BELIEVE BE THE VERY HAPPIEST WOMAN THE SUN
SHINES ON
I HAVE NOT YET SAID ANYTHING CONDEMNATORY OF MR
ROCHESTER'S PROJECT OF
MARRYING FOR INTEREST AND CONNECTIONS
IT SURPRISED ME WHEN I FIRST
DISCOVERED THAT SUCH WAS HIS INTENTION I HAD THOUGHT HIM A MAN UNLIKELY
TO BE INFLUENCED BY MOTIVES SO COMMONPLACE IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE BUT
THE LONGER I CONSIDERED THE POSITION EDUCATION C OF THE PARTIES THE
LESS I FELT JUSTIFIED IN JUDGING AND BLAMING EITHER HIM OR MISS INGRAM
FOR ACTING IN CONFORMITY TO IDEAS AND PRINCIPLES INSTILLED INTO THEM
DOUBTLESS FROM THEIR CHILDHOOD
ALL THEIR CLASS HELD THESE PRINCIPLES
I SUPPOSED THEN THEY HAD REASONS FOR HOLDING THEM SUCH AS I COULD NOT
FATHOM
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT WERE I A GENTLEMAN LIKE HIM I WOULD TAKE
TO MY BOSOM ONLY SUCH A WIFE AS I COULD LOVE BUT THE VERY OBVIOUSNESS OF
THE ADVANTAGES TO THE HUSBAND'S OWN HAPPINESS OFFERED BY THIS PLAN
CONVINCED ME THAT THERE MUST BE ARGUMENTS AGAINST ITS GENERAL ADOPTION OF
WHICH I WAS QUITE IGNORANT OTHERWISE I FELT SURE ALL THE WORLD WOULD ACT
AS I WISHED TO ACT
BUT IN OTHER POINTS AS WELL AS THIS I WAS GROWING VERY LENIENT TO MY
MASTER I WAS FORGETTING ALL HIS FAULTS FOR WHICH I HAD ONCE KEPT A
SHARP LOOK OUT
IT HAD FORMERLY BEEN MY ENDEAVOUR TO STUDY ALL SIDES OF
HIS CHARACTER TO TAKE THE BAD WITH THE GOOD AND FROM THE JUST WEIGHING
OF BOTH TO FORM AN EQUITABLE JUDGMENT
NOW I SAW NO BAD
THE SARCASM
THAT HAD REPELLED THE HARSHNESS THAT HAD STARTLED ME ONCE WERE ONLY
LIKE KEEN CONDIMENTS IN A CHOICE DISH THEIR PRESENCE WAS PUNGENT BUT
THEIR ABSENCE WOULD BE FELT AS COMPARATIVELY INSIPID
AND AS FOR THE
VAGUE SOMETHING WAS IT A SINISTER OR A SORROWFUL A DESIGNING OR A
DESPONDING EXPRESSION THAT OPENED UPON A CAREFUL OBSERVER NOW AND
THEN IN HIS EYE AND CLOSED AGAIN BEFORE ONE COULD FATHOM THE STRANGE
DEPTH PARTIALLY DISCLOSED THAT SOMETHING WHICH USED TO MAKE ME FEAR AND
SHRINK AS IF I HAD BEEN WANDERING AMONGST VOLCANIC LOOKING HILLS AND
HAD SUDDENLY FELT THE GROUND QUIVER AND SEEN IT GAPE THAT SOMETHING I
AT INTERVALS BEHELD STILL AND WITH THROBBING HEART BUT NOT WITH
PALSIED NERVES
INSTEAD OF WISHING TO SHUN I LONGED ONLY TO DARE TO
DIVINE IT AND I THOUGHT MISS INGRAM HAPPY BECAUSE ONE DAY SHE MIGHT
LOOK INTO THE ABYSS AT HER LEISURE EXPLORE ITS SECRETS AND ANALYSE THEIR
NATURE
MEANTIME WHILE I THOUGHT ONLY OF MY MASTER AND HIS FUTURE BRIDE SAW
ONLY THEM HEARD ONLY THEIR DISCOURSE AND CONSIDERED ONLY THEIR
MOVEMENTS OF IMPORTANCE THE REST OF THE PARTY WERE OCCUPIED WITH THEIR
OWN SEPARATE INTERESTS AND PLEASURES
THE LADIES LYNN AND INGRAM
CONTINUED TO CONSORT IN SOLEMN CONFERENCES WHERE THEY NODDED THEIR TWO
TURBANS AT EACH OTHER AND HELD UP THEIR FOUR HANDS IN CONFRONTING
GESTURES OF SURPRISE OR MYSTERY OR HORROR ACCORDING TO THE THEME ON
WHICH THEIR GOSSIP RAN LIKE A PAIR OF MAGNIFIED PUPPETS
MILD MRS
DENT
TALKED WITH GOOD NATURED MRS
ESHTON AND THE TWO SOMETIMES BESTOWED A
COURTEOUS WORD OR SMILE ON ME
SIR GEORGE LYNN COLONEL DENT AND MR
ESHTON DISCUSSED POLITICS OR COUNTY AFFAIRS OR JUSTICE BUSINESS
LORD
INGRAM FLIRTED WITH AMY ESHTON LOUISA PLAYED AND SANG TO AND WITH ONE OF
THE MESSRS
LYNN AND MARY INGRAM LISTENED LANGUIDLY TO THE GALLANT
SPEECHES OF THE OTHER
SOMETIMES ALL AS WITH ONE CONSENT SUSPENDED
THEIR BY PLAY TO OBSERVE AND LISTEN TO THE PRINCIPAL ACTORS FOR AFTER
ALL MR
ROCHESTER AND BECAUSE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH HIM MISS INGRAM
WERE THE LIFE AND SOUL OF THE PARTY
IF HE WAS ABSENT FROM THE ROOM AN
HOUR A PERCEPTIBLE DULNESS SEEMED TO STEAL OVER THE SPIRITS OF HIS
GUESTS AND HIS RE ENTRANCE WAS SURE TO GIVE A FRESH IMPULSE TO THE
VIVACITY OF CONVERSATION
THE WANT OF HIS ANIMATING INFLUENCE APPEARED TO BE PECULIARLY FELT ONE
DAY THAT HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO MILLCOTE ON BUSINESS AND WAS NOT LIKELY
TO RETURN TILL LATE
THE AFTERNOON WAS WET A WALK THE PARTY HAD
PROPOSED TO TAKE TO SEE A GIPSY CAMP LATELY PITCHED ON A COMMON BEYOND
HAY WAS CONSEQUENTLY DEFERRED
SOME OF THE GENTLEMEN WERE GONE TO THE
STABLES THE YOUNGER ONES TOGETHER WITH THE YOUNGER LADIES WERE PLAYING
BILLIARDS IN THE BILLIARD ROOM
THE DOWAGERS INGRAM AND LYNN SOUGHT
SOLACE IN A QUIET GAME AT CARDS
BLANCHE INGRAM AFTER HAVING REPELLED
BY SUPERCILIOUS TACITURNITY SOME EFFORTS OF MRS
DENT AND MRS
ESHTON TO
DRAW HER INTO CONVERSATION HAD FIRST MURMURED OVER SOME SENTIMENTAL
TUNES AND AIRS ON THE PIANO AND THEN HAVING FETCHED A NOVEL FROM THE
LIBRARY HAD FLUNG HERSELF IN HAUGHTY LISTLESSNESS ON A SOFA AND
PREPARED TO BEGUILE BY THE SPELL OF FICTION THE TEDIOUS HOURS OF
ABSENCE
THE ROOM AND THE HOUSE WERE SILENT ONLY NOW AND THEN THE
MERRIMENT OF THE BILLIARD PLAYERS WAS HEARD FROM ABOVE
IT WAS VERGING ON DUSK AND THE CLOCK HAD ALREADY GIVEN WARNING OF THE
HOUR TO DRESS FOR DINNER WHEN LITTLE ADELE WHO KNELT BY ME IN THE
DRAWING ROOM WINDOW SEAT SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED
VOILA MONSIEUR ROCHESTER QUI REVIENT
I TURNED AND MISS INGRAM DARTED FORWARDS FROM HER SOFA THE OTHERS TOO
LOOKED UP FROM THEIR SEVERAL OCCUPATIONS FOR AT THE SAME TIME A
CRUNCHING OF WHEELS AND A SPLASHING TRAMP OF HORSE HOOFS BECAME AUDIBLE
ON THE WET GRAVEL
A POST CHAISE WAS APPROACHING
WHAT CAN POSSESS HIM TO COME HOME IN THAT STYLE SAID MISS INGRAM
HE
RODE MESROUR THE BLACK HORSE DID HE NOT WHEN HE WENT OUT AND PILOT
WAS WITH HIM WHAT HAS HE DONE WITH THE ANIMALS
AS SHE SAID THIS SHE APPROACHED HER TALL PERSON AND AMPLE GARMENTS SO
NEAR THE WINDOW THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO BEND BACK ALMOST TO THE BREAKING
OF MY SPINE IN HER EAGERNESS SHE DID NOT OBSERVE ME AT FIRST BUT WHEN
SHE DID SHE CURLED HER LIP AND MOVED TO ANOTHER CASEMENT
THE
POST CHAISE STOPPED THE DRIVER RANG THE DOOR BELL AND A GENTLEMAN
ALIGHTED ATTIRED IN TRAVELLING GARB BUT IT WAS NOT MR
ROCHESTER IT WAS
A TALL FASHIONABLE LOOKING MAN A STRANGER
HOW PROVOKING EXCLAIMED MISS INGRAM YOU TIRESOME MONKEY
APOSTROPHISING ADELE WHO PERCHED YOU UP IN THE WINDOW TO GIVE FALSE
INTELLIGENCE AND SHE CAST ON ME AN ANGRY GLANCE AS IF I WERE IN FAULT
SOME PARLEYING WAS AUDIBLE IN THE HALL AND SOON THE NEW COMER ENTERED
HE BOWED TO LADY INGRAM AS DEEMING HER THE ELDEST LADY PRESENT
IT APPEARS I COME AT AN INOPPORTUNE TIME MADAM SAID HE WHEN MY
FRIEND MR
ROCHESTER IS FROM HOME BUT I ARRIVE FROM A VERY LONG
JOURNEY AND I THINK I MAY PRESUME SO FAR ON OLD AND INTIMATE
ACQUAINTANCE AS TO INSTAL MYSELF HERE TILL HE RETURNS
HIS MANNER WAS POLITE HIS ACCENT IN SPEAKING STRUCK ME AS BEING
SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL NOT PRECISELY FOREIGN BUT STILL NOT ALTOGETHER
ENGLISH HIS AGE MIGHT BE ABOUT MR
ROCHESTER'S BETWEEN THIRTY AND
FORTY HIS COMPLEXION WAS SINGULARLY SALLOW OTHERWISE HE WAS A
FINE LOOKING MAN AT FIRST SIGHT ESPECIALLY
ON CLOSER EXAMINATION YOU
DETECTED SOMETHING IN HIS FACE THAT DISPLEASED OR RATHER THAT FAILED TO
PLEASE
HIS FEATURES WERE REGULAR BUT TOO RELAXED HIS EYE WAS LARGE
AND WELL CUT BUT THE LIFE LOOKING OUT OF IT WAS A TAME VACANT LIFE AT
LEAST SO I THOUGHT
THE SOUND OF THE DRESSING BELL DISPERSED THE PARTY
IT WAS NOT TILL
AFTER DINNER THAT I SAW HIM AGAIN HE THEN SEEMED QUITE AT HIS EASE
BUT
I LIKED HIS PHYSIOGNOMY EVEN LESS THAN BEFORE IT STRUCK ME AS BEING AT
THE SAME TIME UNSETTLED AND INANIMATE
HIS EYE WANDERED AND HAD NO
MEANING IN ITS WANDERING THIS GAVE HIM AN ODD LOOK SUCH AS I NEVER
REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN
FOR A HANDSOME AND NOT AN UNAMIABLE LOOKING
MAN HE REPELLED ME EXCEEDINGLY THERE WAS NO POWER IN THAT
SMOOTH SKINNED FACE OF A FULL OVAL SHAPE NO FIRMNESS IN THAT AQUILINE
NOSE AND SMALL CHERRY MOUTH THERE WAS NO THOUGHT ON THE LOW EVEN
FOREHEAD NO COMMAND IN THAT BLANK BROWN EYE
AS I SAT IN MY USUAL NOOK AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH THE LIGHT OF THE
GIRANDOLES ON THE MANTELPIECE BEAMING FULL OVER HIM FOR HE OCCUPIED AN
ARM CHAIR DRAWN CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND KEPT SHRINKING STILL NEARER AS IF
HE WERE COLD I COMPARED HIM WITH MR
ROCHESTER
I THINK WITH DEFERENCE
BE IT SPOKEN THE CONTRAST COULD NOT BE MUCH GREATER BETWEEN A SLEEK
GANDER AND A FIERCE FALCON BETWEEN A MEEK SHEEP AND THE ROUGH COATED
KEEN EYED DOG ITS GUARDIAN
HE HAD SPOKEN OF MR
ROCHESTER AS AN OLD FRIEND
A CURIOUS FRIENDSHIP
THEIRS MUST HAVE BEEN A POINTED ILLUSTRATION INDEED OF THE OLD ADAGE
THAT EXTREMES MEET
TWO OR THREE OF THE GENTLEMEN SAT NEAR HIM AND I CAUGHT AT TIMES SCRAPS
OF THEIR CONVERSATION ACROSS THE ROOM
AT FIRST I COULD NOT MAKE MUCH
SENSE OF WHAT I HEARD FOR THE DISCOURSE OF LOUISA ESHTON AND MARY
INGRAM WHO SAT NEARER TO ME CONFUSED THE FRAGMENTARY SENTENCES THAT
REACHED ME AT INTERVALS
THESE LAST WERE DISCUSSING THE STRANGER THEY
BOTH CALLED HIM A BEAUTIFUL MAN LOUISA SAID HE WAS A LOVE OF A
CREATURE AND SHE ADORED HIM AND MARY INSTANCED HIS PRETTY LITTLE
MOUTH AND NICE NOSE AS HER IDEAL OF THE CHARMING
AND WHAT A SWEET TEMPERED FOREHEAD HE HAS CRIED LOUISA SO
SMOOTH NONE OF THOSE FROWNING IRREGULARITIES I DISLIKE SO MUCH AND SUCH
A PLACID EYE AND SMILE
AND THEN TO MY GREAT RELIEF MR
HENRY LYNN SUMMONED THEM TO THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE ROOM TO SETTLE SOME POINT ABOUT THE DEFERRED EXCURSION TO
HAY COMMON
I WAS NOW ABLE TO CONCENTRATE MY ATTENTION ON THE GROUP BY THE FIRE AND
I PRESENTLY GATHERED THAT THE NEW COMER WAS CALLED MR
MASON THEN I
LEARNED THAT HE WAS BUT JUST ARRIVED IN ENGLAND AND THAT HE CAME FROM
SOME HOT COUNTRY WHICH WAS THE REASON DOUBTLESS HIS FACE WAS SO
SALLOW AND THAT HE SAT SO NEAR THE HEARTH AND WORE A SURTOUT IN THE
HOUSE
PRESENTLY THE WORDS JAMAICA KINGSTON SPANISH TOWN INDICATED
THE WEST INDIES AS HIS RESIDENCE AND IT WAS WITH NO LITTLE SURPRISE I
GATHERED ERE LONG THAT HE HAD THERE FIRST SEEN AND BECOME ACQUAINTED
WITH MR
ROCHESTER
HE SPOKE OF HIS FRIEND'S DISLIKE OF THE BURNING
HEATS THE HURRICANES AND RAINY SEASONS OF THAT REGION
I KNEW MR
ROCHESTER HAD BEEN A TRAVELLER MRS
FAIRFAX HAD SAID SO BUT I THOUGHT
THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE HAD BOUNDED HIS WANDERINGS TILL NOW I HAD NEVER
HEARD A HINT GIVEN OF VISITS TO MORE DISTANT SHORES
I WAS PONDERING THESE THINGS WHEN AN INCIDENT AND A SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTED
ONE BROKE THE THREAD OF MY MUSINGS
MR
MASON SHIVERING AS SOME ONE
CHANCED TO OPEN THE DOOR ASKED FOR MORE COAL TO BE PUT ON THE FIRE
WHICH HAD BURNT OUT ITS FLAME THOUGH ITS MASS OF CINDER STILL SHONE HOT
AND RED
THE FOOTMAN WHO BROUGHT THE COAL IN GOING OUT STOPPED NEAR
MR
ESHTON'S CHAIR AND SAID SOMETHING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE OF WHICH I
HEARD ONLY THE WORDS OLD WOMAN QUITE TROUBLESOME
TELL HER SHE SHALL BE PUT IN THE STOCKS IF SHE DOES NOT TAKE HERSELF
OFF REPLIED THE MAGISTRATE
NO STOP INTERRUPTED COLONEL DENT
DON'T SEND HER AWAY ESHTON WE
MIGHT TURN THE THING TO ACCOUNT BETTER CONSULT THE LADIES AND
SPEAKING ALOUD HE CONTINUED LADIES YOU TALKED OF GOING TO HAY COMMON
TO VISIT THE GIPSY CAMP SAM HERE SAYS THAT ONE OF THE OLD MOTHER BUNCHES
IS IN THE SERVANTS' HALL AT THIS MOMENT AND INSISTS UPON BEING BROUGHT
IN BEFORE 'THE QUALITY TO TELL THEM THEIR FORTUNES
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
SEE HER
SURELY COLONEL CRIED LADY INGRAM YOU WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE SUCH A LOW
IMPOSTOR DISMISS HER BY ALL MEANS AT ONCE
BUT I CANNOT PERSUADE HER TO GO AWAY MY LADY SAID THE FOOTMAN NOR
CAN ANY OF THE SERVANTS MRS
FAIRFAX IS WITH HER JUST NOW ENTREATING
HER TO BE GONE BUT SHE HAS TAKEN A CHAIR IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER AND SAYS
NOTHING SHALL STIR HER FROM IT TILL SHE GETS LEAVE TO COME IN HERE
WHAT DOES SHE WANT ASKED MRS
ESHTON
'TO TELL THE GENTRY THEIR FORTUNES SHE SAYS MA'AM AND SHE SWEARS SHE
MUST AND WILL DO IT
WHAT IS SHE LIKE INQUIRED THE MISSES ESHTON IN A BREATH
A SHOCKINGLY UGLY OLD CREATURE MISS ALMOST AS BLACK AS A CROCK
WHY SHE'S A REAL SORCERESS CRIED FREDERICK LYNN
LET US HAVE HER
IN OF COURSE
TO BE SURE REJOINED HIS BROTHER IT WOULD BE A THOUSAND PITIES TO
THROW AWAY SUCH A CHANCE OF FUN
MY DEAR BOYS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT EXCLAIMED MRS
LYNN
I CANNOT POSSIBLY COUNTENANCE ANY SUCH INCONSISTENT PROCEEDING CHIMED
IN THE DOWAGER INGRAM
INDEED MAMA BUT YOU CAN AND WILL PRONOUNCED THE HAUGHTY VOICE OF
BLANCHE AS SHE TURNED ROUND ON THE PIANO STOOL WHERE TILL NOW SHE HAD
SAT SILENT APPARENTLY EXAMINING SUNDRY SHEETS OF MUSIC
I HAVE A
CURIOSITY TO HEAR MY FORTUNE TOLD THEREFORE SAM ORDER THE BELDAME
FORWARD
MY DARLING BLANCHE RECOLLECT
I DO I RECOLLECT ALL YOU CAN SUGGEST AND I MUST HAVE MY WILL QUICK
SAM
YES YES YES CRIED ALL THE JUVENILES BOTH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
LET
HER COME IT WILL BE EXCELLENT SPORT
THE FOOTMAN STILL LINGERED
SHE LOOKS SUCH A ROUGH ONE SAID HE
GO EJACULATED MISS INGRAM AND THE MAN WENT
EXCITEMENT INSTANTLY SEIZED THE WHOLE PARTY A RUNNING FIRE OF RAILLERY
AND JESTS WAS PROCEEDING WHEN SAM RETURNED
SHE WON'T COME NOW SAID HE
SHE SAYS IT'S NOT HER MISSION TO APPEAR
BEFORE THE 'VULGAR HERD' THEM'S HER WORDS
I MUST SHOW HER INTO A ROOM
BY HERSELF AND THEN THOSE WHO WISH TO CONSULT HER MUST GO TO HER ONE BY
ONE
YOU SEE NOW MY QUEENLY BLANCHE BEGAN LADY INGRAM SHE ENCROACHES
BE
ADVISED MY ANGEL GIRL AND
SHOW HER INTO THE LIBRARY OF COURSE CUT IN THE ANGEL GIRL IT IS
NOT MY MISSION TO LISTEN TO HER BEFORE THE VULGAR HERD EITHER I MEAN TO
HAVE HER ALL TO MYSELF
IS THERE A FIRE IN THE LIBRARY
YES MA'AM BUT SHE LOOKS SUCH A TINKLER
CEASE THAT CHATTER BLOCKHEAD AND DO MY BIDDING
AGAIN SAM VANISHED AND MYSTERY ANIMATION EXPECTATION ROSE TO FULL FLOW
ONCE MORE
SHE'S READY NOW SAID THE FOOTMAN AS HE REAPPEARED
SHE WISHES TO
KNOW WHO WILL BE HER FIRST VISITOR
I THINK I HAD BETTER JUST LOOK IN UPON HER BEFORE ANY OF THE LADIES GO
SAID COLONEL DENT
TELL HER SAM A GENTLEMAN IS COMING
SAM WENT AND RETURNED
SHE SAYS SIR THAT SHE'LL HAVE NO GENTLEMEN THEY NEED NOT TROUBLE
THEMSELVES TO COME NEAR HER NOR HE ADDED WITH DIFFICULTY SUPPRESSING
A TITTER ANY LADIES EITHER EXCEPT THE YOUNG AND SINGLE
BY JOVE SHE HAS TASTE EXCLAIMED HENRY LYNN
MISS INGRAM ROSE SOLEMNLY I GO FIRST SHE SAID IN A TONE WHICH MIGHT
HAVE BEFITTED THE LEADER OF A FORLORN HOPE MOUNTING A BREACH IN THE VAN
OF HIS MEN
OH MY BEST OH MY DEAREST PAUSE REFLECT WAS HER MAMA'S CRY BUT
SHE SWEPT PAST HER IN STATELY SILENCE PASSED THROUGH THE DOOR WHICH
COLONEL DENT HELD OPEN AND WE HEARD HER ENTER THE LIBRARY
A COMPARATIVE SILENCE ENSUED
LADY INGRAM THOUGHT IT LE CAS TO WRING
HER HANDS WHICH SHE DID ACCORDINGLY
MISS MARY DECLARED SHE FELT FOR
HER PART SHE NEVER DARED VENTURE
AMY AND LOUISA ESHTON TITTERED UNDER
THEIR BREATH AND LOOKED A LITTLE FRIGHTENED
THE MINUTES PASSED VERY SLOWLY FIFTEEN WERE COUNTED BEFORE THE LIBRARY
DOOR AGAIN OPENED
MISS INGRAM RETURNED TO US THROUGH THE ARCH
WOULD SHE LAUGH WOULD SHE TAKE IT AS A JOKE ALL EYES MET HER WITH A
GLANCE OF EAGER CURIOSITY AND SHE MET ALL EYES WITH ONE OF REBUFF AND
COLDNESS SHE LOOKED NEITHER FLURRIED NOR MERRY SHE WALKED STIFFLY TO
HER SEAT AND TOOK IT IN SILENCE
WELL BLANCHE SAID LORD INGRAM
WHAT DID SHE SAY SISTER ASKED MARY
WHAT DID YOU THINK HOW DO YOU FEEL IS SHE A REAL FORTUNE TELLER
DEMANDED THE MISSES ESHTON
NOW NOW GOOD PEOPLE RETURNED MISS INGRAM DON'T PRESS UPON ME
REALLY YOUR ORGANS OF WONDER AND CREDULITY ARE EASILY EXCITED YOU SEEM
BY THE IMPORTANCE OF YOU ALL MY GOOD MAMA INCLUDED ASCRIBE TO THIS
MATTER ABSOLUTELY TO BELIEVE WE HAVE A GENUINE WITCH IN THE HOUSE WHO
IS IN CLOSE ALLIANCE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN
I HAVE SEEN A GIPSY
VAGABOND SHE HAS PRACTISED IN HACKNEYED FASHION THE SCIENCE OF PALMISTRY
AND TOLD ME WHAT SUCH PEOPLE USUALLY TELL
MY WHIM IS GRATIFIED AND NOW
I THINK MR
ESHTON WILL DO WELL TO PUT THE HAG IN THE STOCKS TO MORROW
MORNING AS HE THREATENED
MISS INGRAM TOOK A BOOK LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AND SO DECLINED FURTHER
CONVERSATION
I WATCHED HER FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR DURING ALL THAT
TIME SHE NEVER TURNED A PAGE AND HER FACE GREW MOMENTLY DARKER MORE
DISSATISFIED AND MORE SOURLY EXPRESSIVE OF DISAPPOINTMENT
SHE HAD
OBVIOUSLY NOT HEARD ANYTHING TO HER ADVANTAGE AND IT SEEMED TO ME FROM
HER PROLONGED FIT OF GLOOM AND TACITURNITY THAT SHE HERSELF
NOTWITHSTANDING HER PROFESSED INDIFFERENCE ATTACHED UNDUE IMPORTANCE TO
WHATEVER REVELATIONS HAD BEEN MADE HER
DURING ALL THAT TIME SHE NEVER TURNED A PAGE P184 JPG
MEANTIME MARY INGRAM AMY AND LOUISA ESHTON DECLARED THEY DARED NOT GO
ALONE AND YET THEY ALL WISHED TO GO
A NEGOTIATION WAS OPENED THROUGH
THE MEDIUM OF THE AMBASSADOR SAM AND AFTER MUCH PACING TO AND FRO
TILL I THINK THE SAID SAM'S CALVES MUST HAVE ACHED WITH THE EXERCISE
PERMISSION WAS AT LAST WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY EXTORTED FROM THE RIGOROUS
SIBYL FOR THE THREE TO WAIT UPON HER IN A BODY
THEIR VISIT WAS NOT SO STILL AS MISS INGRAM'S HAD BEEN WE HEARD
HYSTERICAL GIGGLING AND LITTLE SHRIEKS PROCEEDING FROM THE LIBRARY AND
AT THE END OF ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES THEY BURST THE DOOR OPEN AND CAME
RUNNING ACROSS THE HALL AS IF THEY WERE HALF SCARED OUT OF THEIR WITS
I AM SURE SHE IS SOMETHING NOT RIGHT THEY CRIED ONE AND ALL
SHE
TOLD US SUCH THINGS SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT US AND THEY SANK BREATHLESS
INTO THE VARIOUS SEATS THE GENTLEMEN HASTENED TO BRING THEM
PRESSED FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION THEY DECLARED SHE HAD TOLD THEM OF
THINGS THEY HAD SAID AND DONE WHEN THEY WERE MERE CHILDREN DESCRIBED
BOOKS AND ORNAMENTS THEY HAD IN THEIR BOUDOIRS AT HOME KEEPSAKES THAT
DIFFERENT RELATIONS HAD PRESENTED TO THEM
THEY AFFIRMED THAT SHE HAD
EVEN DIVINED THEIR THOUGHTS AND HAD WHISPERED IN THE EAR OF EACH THE
NAME OF THE PERSON SHE LIKED BEST IN THE WORLD AND INFORMED THEM OF WHAT
THEY MOST WISHED FOR
HERE THE GENTLEMEN INTERPOSED WITH EARNEST PETITIONS TO BE FURTHER
ENLIGHTENED ON THESE TWO LAST NAMED POINTS BUT THEY GOT ONLY BLUSHES
EJACULATIONS TREMORS AND TITTERS IN RETURN FOR THEIR IMPORTUNITY
THE
MATRONS MEANTIME OFFERED VINAIGRETTES AND WIELDED FANS AND AGAIN AND
AGAIN REITERATED THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR CONCERN THAT THEIR WARNING HAD
NOT BEEN TAKEN IN TIME AND THE ELDER GENTLEMEN LAUGHED AND THE YOUNGER
URGED THEIR SERVICES ON THE AGITATED FAIR ONES
IN THE MIDST OF THE TUMULT AND WHILE MY EYES AND EARS WERE FULLY ENGAGED
IN THE SCENE BEFORE ME I HEARD A HEM CLOSE AT MY ELBOW I TURNED AND
SAW SAM
IF YOU PLEASE MISS THE GIPSY DECLARES THAT THERE IS ANOTHER YOUNG
SINGLE LADY IN THE ROOM WHO HAS NOT BEEN TO HER YET AND SHE SWEARS SHE
WILL NOT GO TILL SHE HAS SEEN ALL
I THOUGHT IT MUST BE YOU THERE IS NO
ONE ELSE FOR IT
WHAT SHALL I TELL HER
OH I WILL GO BY ALL MEANS I ANSWERED AND I WAS GLAD OF THE
UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITY TO GRATIFY MY MUCH EXCITED CURIOSITY
I SLIPPED
OUT OF THE ROOM UNOBSERVED BY ANY EYE FOR THE COMPANY WERE GATHERED IN
ONE MASS ABOUT THE TREMBLING TRIO JUST RETURNED AND I CLOSED THE DOOR
QUIETLY BEHIND ME
IF YOU LIKE MISS SAID SAM I'LL WAIT IN THE HALL FOR YOU AND IF SHE
FRIGHTENS YOU JUST CALL AND I'LL COME IN
NO SAM RETURN TO THE KITCHEN I AM NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID NOR WAS
I BUT I WAS A GOOD DEAL INTERESTED AND EXCITED
CHAPTER XIX
THE LIBRARY LOOKED TRANQUIL ENOUGH AS I ENTERED IT AND THE SIBYL IF
SIBYL SHE WERE WAS SEATED SNUGLY ENOUGH IN AN EASY CHAIR AT THE CHIMNEY
CORNER
SHE HAD ON A RED CLOAK AND A BLACK BONNET OR RATHER A BROAD
BRIMMED GIPSY HAT TIED DOWN WITH A STRIPED HANDKERCHIEF UNDER HER CHIN
AN EXTINGUISHED CANDLE STOOD ON THE TABLE SHE WAS BENDING OVER THE FIRE
AND SEEMED READING IN A LITTLE BLACK BOOK LIKE A PRAYER BOOK BY THE
LIGHT OF THE BLAZE SHE MUTTERED THE WORDS TO HERSELF AS MOST OLD WOMEN
DO WHILE SHE READ SHE DID NOT DESIST IMMEDIATELY ON MY ENTRANCE IT
APPEARED SHE WISHED TO FINISH A PARAGRAPH
I STOOD ON THE RUG AND WARMED MY HANDS WHICH WERE RATHER COLD WITH
SITTING AT A DISTANCE FROM THE DRAWING ROOM FIRE
I FELT NOW AS COMPOSED
AS EVER I DID IN MY LIFE THERE WAS NOTHING INDEED IN THE GIPSY'S
APPEARANCE TO TROUBLE ONE'S CALM
SHE SHUT HER BOOK AND SLOWLY LOOKED
UP HER HAT BRIM PARTIALLY SHADED HER FACE YET I COULD SEE AS SHE
RAISED IT THAT IT WAS A STRANGE ONE
IT LOOKED ALL BROWN AND BLACK ELF
LOCKS BRISTLED OUT FROM BENEATH A WHITE BAND WHICH PASSED UNDER HER CHIN
AND CAME HALF OVER HER CHEEKS OR RATHER JAWS HER EYE CONFRONTED ME AT
ONCE WITH A BOLD AND DIRECT GAZE
WELL AND YOU WANT YOUR FORTUNE TOLD SHE SAID IN A VOICE AS DECIDED
AS HER GLANCE AS HARSH AS HER FEATURES
I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT MOTHER YOU MAY PLEASE YOURSELF BUT I OUGHT TO
WARN YOU I HAVE NO FAITH
IT'S LIKE YOUR IMPUDENCE TO SAY SO I EXPECTED IT OF YOU I HEARD IT IN
YOUR STEP AS YOU CROSSED THE THRESHOLD
DID YOU YOU'VE A QUICK EAR
I HAVE AND A QUICK EYE AND A QUICK BRAIN
YOU NEED THEM ALL IN YOUR TRADE
I DO ESPECIALLY WHEN I'VE CUSTOMERS LIKE YOU TO DEAL WITH
WHY DON'T
YOU TREMBLE
I'M NOT COLD
WHY DON'T YOU TURN PALE
I AM NOT SICK
WHY DON'T YOU CONSULT MY ART
I'M NOT SILLY
THE OLD CRONE NICHERED A LAUGH UNDER HER BONNET AND BANDAGE SHE THEN
DREW OUT A SHORT BLACK PIPE AND LIGHTING IT BEGAN TO SMOKE
HAVING
INDULGED A WHILE IN THIS SEDATIVE SHE RAISED HER BENT BODY TOOK THE
PIPE FROM HER LIPS AND WHILE GAZING STEADILY AT THE FIRE SAID VERY
DELIBERATELY YOU ARE COLD YOU ARE SICK AND YOU ARE SILLY
PROVE IT I REJOINED
I WILL IN FEW WORDS
YOU ARE COLD BECAUSE YOU ARE ALONE NO CONTACT
STRIKES THE FIRE FROM YOU THAT IS IN YOU
YOU ARE SICK BECAUSE THE BEST
OF FEELINGS THE HIGHEST AND THE SWEETEST GIVEN TO MAN KEEPS FAR AWAY
FROM YOU
YOU ARE SILLY BECAUSE SUFFER AS YOU MAY YOU WILL NOT BECKON
IT TO APPROACH NOR WILL YOU STIR ONE STEP TO MEET IT WHERE IT WAITS
YOU
SHE AGAIN PUT HER SHORT BLACK PIPE TO HER LIPS AND RENEWED HER SMOKING
WITH VIGOUR
YOU MIGHT SAY ALL THAT TO ALMOST ANY ONE WHO YOU KNEW LIVED AS A
SOLITARY DEPENDENT IN A GREAT HOUSE
I MIGHT SAY IT TO ALMOST ANY ONE BUT WOULD IT BE TRUE OF ALMOST ANY
ONE
IN MY CIRCUMSTANCES
YES JUST SO IN YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES BUT FIND ME ANOTHER PRECISELY
PLACED AS YOU ARE
IT WOULD BE EASY TO FIND YOU THOUSANDS
YOU COULD SCARCELY FIND ME ONE
IF YOU KNEW IT YOU ARE PECULIARLY
SITUATED VERY NEAR HAPPINESS YES WITHIN REACH OF IT
THE MATERIALS
ARE ALL PREPARED THERE ONLY WANTS A MOVEMENT TO COMBINE THEM
CHANCE
LAID THEM SOMEWHAT APART LET THEM BE ONCE APPROACHED AND BLISS RESULTS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ENIGMAS
I NEVER COULD GUESS A RIDDLE IN MY LIFE
IF YOU WISH ME TO SPEAK MORE PLAINLY SHOW ME YOUR PALM
AND I MUST CROSS IT WITH SILVER I SUPPOSE
TO BE SURE
I GAVE HER A SHILLING SHE PUT IT INTO AN OLD STOCKING FOOT WHICH SHE
TOOK OUT OF HER POCKET AND HAVING TIED IT ROUND AND RETURNED IT SHE
TOLD ME TO HOLD OUT MY HAND
I DID
SHE APPROACHED HER FACE TO THE
PALM AND PORED OVER IT WITHOUT TOUCHING IT
IT IS TOO FINE SAID SHE
I CAN MAKE NOTHING OF SUCH A HAND AS THAT
ALMOST WITHOUT LINES BESIDES WHAT IS IN A PALM DESTINY IS NOT WRITTEN
THERE
I BELIEVE YOU SAID I
NO SHE CONTINUED IT IS IN THE FACE ON THE FOREHEAD ABOUT THE EYES
IN THE LINES OF THE MOUTH
KNEEL AND LIFT UP YOUR HEAD
AH NOW YOU ARE COMING TO REALITY I SAID AS I OBEYED HER
I SHALL
BEGIN TO PUT SOME FAITH IN YOU PRESENTLY
I KNELT WITHIN HALF A YARD OF HER
SHE STIRRED THE FIRE SO THAT A
RIPPLE OF LIGHT BROKE FROM THE DISTURBED COAL THE GLARE HOWEVER AS SHE
SAT ONLY THREW HER FACE INTO DEEPER SHADOW MINE IT ILLUMINED
I WONDER WITH WHAT FEELINGS YOU CAME TO ME TO NIGHT SHE SAID WHEN SHE
HAD EXAMINED ME A WHILE
I WONDER WHAT THOUGHTS ARE BUSY IN YOUR HEART
DURING ALL THE HOURS YOU SIT IN YONDER ROOM WITH THE FINE PEOPLE FLITTING
BEFORE YOU LIKE SHAPES IN A MAGIC LANTERN JUST AS LITTLE SYMPATHETIC
COMMUNION PASSING BETWEEN YOU AND THEM AS IF THEY WERE REALLY MERE
SHADOWS OF HUMAN FORMS AND NOT THE ACTUAL SUBSTANCE
I FEEL TIRED OFTEN SLEEPY SOMETIMES BUT SELDOM SAD
THEN YOU HAVE SOME SECRET HOPE TO BUOY YOU UP AND PLEASE YOU WITH
WHISPERS OF THE FUTURE
NOT I
THE UTMOST I HOPE IS TO SAVE MONEY ENOUGH OUT OF MY EARNINGS TO
SET UP A SCHOOL SOME DAY IN A LITTLE HOUSE RENTED BY MYSELF
A MEAN NUTRIMENT FOR THE SPIRIT TO EXIST ON AND SITTING IN THAT WINDOW
SEAT YOU SEE I KNOW YOUR HABITS
YOU HAVE LEARNED THEM FROM THE SERVANTS
AH YOU THINK YOURSELF SHARP
WELL PERHAPS I HAVE TO SPEAK TRUTH I
HAVE AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH ONE OF THEM MRS
POOLE
I STARTED TO MY FEET WHEN I HEARD THE NAME
YOU HAVE HAVE YOU THOUGHT I THERE IS DIABLERIE IN THE BUSINESS
AFTER ALL THEN
DON'T BE ALARMED CONTINUED THE STRANGE BEING SHE'S A SAFE HAND IS
MRS
POOLE CLOSE AND QUIET ANY ONE MAY REPOSE CONFIDENCE IN HER
BUT
AS I WAS SAYING SITTING IN THAT WINDOW SEAT DO YOU THINK OF NOTHING BUT
YOUR FUTURE SCHOOL HAVE YOU NO PRESENT INTEREST IN ANY OF THE COMPANY
WHO OCCUPY THE SOFAS AND CHAIRS BEFORE YOU IS THERE NOT ONE FACE YOU
STUDY ONE FIGURE WHOSE MOVEMENTS YOU FOLLOW WITH AT LEAST CURIOSITY
I LIKE TO OBSERVE ALL THE FACES AND ALL THE FIGURES
BUT DO YOU NEVER SINGLE ONE FROM THE REST OR IT MAY BE TWO
I DO FREQUENTLY WHEN THE GESTURES OR LOOKS OF A PAIR SEEM TELLING A
TALE IT AMUSES ME TO WATCH THEM
WHAT TALE DO YOU LIKE BEST TO HEAR
OH I HAVE NOT MUCH CHOICE THEY GENERALLY RUN ON THE SAME
THEME COURTSHIP AND PROMISE TO END IN THE SAME CATASTROPHE MARRIAGE
AND DO YOU LIKE THAT MONOTONOUS THEME
POSITIVELY I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT IT IS NOTHING TO ME
NOTHING TO YOU WHEN A LADY YOUNG AND FULL OF LIFE AND HEALTH
CHARMING WITH BEAUTY AND ENDOWED WITH THE GIFTS OF RANK AND FORTUNE SITS
AND SMILES IN THE EYES OF A GENTLEMAN YOU
I WHAT
YOU KNOW AND PERHAPS THINK WELL OF
I DON'T KNOW THE GENTLEMEN HERE
I HAVE SCARCELY INTERCHANGED A
SYLLABLE WITH ONE OF THEM AND AS TO THINKING WELL OF THEM I CONSIDER
SOME RESPECTABLE AND STATELY AND MIDDLE AGED AND OTHERS YOUNG
DASHING HANDSOME AND LIVELY BUT CERTAINLY THEY ARE ALL AT LIBERTY TO
BE THE RECIPIENTS OF WHOSE SMILES THEY PLEASE WITHOUT MY FEELING
DISPOSED TO CONSIDER THE TRANSACTION OF ANY MOMENT TO ME
YOU DON'T KNOW THE GENTLEMEN HERE YOU HAVE NOT EXCHANGED A SYLLABLE
WITH ONE OF THEM WILL YOU SAY THAT OF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE
HE IS NOT AT HOME
A PROFOUND REMARK A MOST INGENIOUS QUIBBLE HE WENT TO MILLCOTE THIS
MORNING AND WILL BE BACK HERE TO NIGHT OR TO MORROW DOES THAT
CIRCUMSTANCE EXCLUDE HIM FROM THE LIST OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE BLOT HIM AS
IT WERE OUT OF EXISTENCE
NO BUT I CAN SCARCELY SEE WHAT MR
ROCHESTER HAS TO DO WITH THE THEME
YOU HAD INTRODUCED
I WAS TALKING OF LADIES SMILING IN THE EYES OF GENTLEMEN AND OF LATE SO
MANY SMILES HAVE BEEN SHED INTO MR
ROCHESTER'S EYES THAT THEY OVERFLOW
LIKE TWO CUPS FILLED ABOVE THE BRIM HAVE YOU NEVER REMARKED THAT
MR
ROCHESTER HAS A RIGHT TO ENJOY THE SOCIETY OF HIS GUESTS
NO QUESTION ABOUT HIS RIGHT BUT HAVE YOU NEVER OBSERVED THAT OF ALL
THE TALES TOLD HERE ABOUT MATRIMONY MR
ROCHESTER HAS BEEN FAVOURED WITH
THE MOST LIVELY AND THE MOST CONTINUOUS
THE EAGERNESS OF A LISTENER QUICKENS THE TONGUE OF A NARRATOR I SAID
THIS RATHER TO MYSELF THAN TO THE GIPSY WHOSE STRANGE TALK VOICE
MANNER HAD BY THIS TIME WRAPPED ME IN A KIND OF DREAM
ONE UNEXPECTED
SENTENCE CAME FROM HER LIPS AFTER ANOTHER TILL I GOT INVOLVED IN A WEB
OF MYSTIFICATION AND WONDERED WHAT UNSEEN SPIRIT HAD BEEN SITTING FOR
WEEKS BY MY HEART WATCHING ITS WORKINGS AND TAKING RECORD OF EVERY PULSE
EAGERNESS OF A LISTENER REPEATED SHE YES MR
ROCHESTER HAS SAT BY
THE HOUR HIS EAR INCLINED TO THE FASCINATING LIPS THAT TOOK SUCH DELIGHT
IN THEIR TASK OF COMMUNICATING AND MR
ROCHESTER WAS SO WILLING TO
RECEIVE AND LOOKED SO GRATEFUL FOR THE PASTIME GIVEN HIM YOU HAVE
NOTICED THIS
GRATEFUL I CANNOT REMEMBER DETECTING GRATITUDE IN HIS FACE
DETECTING YOU HAVE ANALYSED THEN
AND WHAT DID YOU DETECT IF NOT
GRATITUDE
I SAID NOTHING
YOU HAVE SEEN LOVE HAVE YOU NOT AND LOOKING FORWARD YOU HAVE SEEN
HIM MARRIED AND BEHELD HIS BRIDE HAPPY
HUMPH NOT EXACTLY
YOUR WITCH'S SKILL IS RATHER AT FAULT SOMETIMES
WHAT THE DEVIL HAVE YOU SEEN THEN
NEVER MIND I CAME HERE TO INQUIRE NOT TO CONFESS
IS IT KNOWN THAT
MR
ROCHESTER IS TO BE MARRIED
YES AND TO THE BEAUTIFUL MISS INGRAM
SHORTLY
APPEARANCES WOULD WARRANT THAT CONCLUSION AND NO DOUBT THOUGH WITH
AN AUDACITY THAT WANTS CHASTISING OUT OF YOU YOU SEEM TO QUESTION IT
THEY WILL BE A SUPERLATIVELY HAPPY PAIR
HE MUST LOVE SUCH A HANDSOME
NOBLE WITTY ACCOMPLISHED LADY AND PROBABLY SHE LOVES HIM OR IF NOT
HIS PERSON AT LEAST HIS PURSE
I KNOW SHE CONSIDERS THE ROCHESTER
ESTATE ELIGIBLE TO THE LAST DEGREE THOUGH GOD PARDON ME I TOLD HER
SOMETHING ON THAT POINT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO WHICH MADE HER LOOK WONDROUS
GRAVE THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH FELL HALF AN INCH
I WOULD ADVISE HER
BLACKAVICED SUITOR TO LOOK OUT IF ANOTHER COMES WITH A LONGER OR
CLEARER RENT ROLL HE'S DISHED
BUT MOTHER I DID NOT COME TO HEAR MR
ROCHESTER'S FORTUNE I CAME TO
HEAR MY OWN AND YOU HAVE TOLD ME NOTHING OF IT
YOUR FORTUNE IS YET DOUBTFUL WHEN I EXAMINED YOUR FACE ONE TRAIT
CONTRADICTED ANOTHER
CHANCE HAS METED YOU A MEASURE OF HAPPINESS THAT
I KNOW
I KNEW IT BEFORE I CAME HERE THIS EVENING
SHE HAS LAID IT
CAREFULLY ON ONE SIDE FOR YOU
I SAW HER DO IT
IT DEPENDS ON YOURSELF
TO STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND AND TAKE IT UP BUT WHETHER YOU WILL DO SO IS
THE PROBLEM I STUDY
KNEEL AGAIN ON THE RUG
DON'T KEEP ME LONG THE FIRE SCORCHES ME
SHE DID NOT STOOP TOWARDS ME BUT ONLY GAZED LEANING BACK IN HER CHAIR
P190 JPG
I KNELT
SHE DID NOT STOOP TOWARDS ME BUT ONLY GAZED LEANING BACK IN
HER CHAIR
SHE BEGAN MUTTERING
THE FLAME FLICKERS IN THE EYE THE EYE SHINES LIKE DEW IT LOOKS SOFT
AND FULL OF FEELING IT SMILES AT MY JARGON IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE
IMPRESSION FOLLOWS IMPRESSION THROUGH ITS CLEAR SPHERE WHERE IT CEASES
TO SMILE IT IS SAD AN UNCONSCIOUS LASSITUDE WEIGHS ON THE LID THAT
SIGNIFIES MELANCHOLY RESULTING FROM LONELINESS
IT TURNS FROM ME IT
WILL NOT SUFFER FURTHER SCRUTINY IT SEEMS TO DENY BY A MOCKING GLANCE
THE TRUTH OF THE DISCOVERIES I HAVE ALREADY MADE TO DISOWN THE CHARGE
BOTH OF SENSIBILITY AND CHAGRIN ITS PRIDE AND RESERVE ONLY CONFIRM ME IN
MY OPINION
THE EYE IS FAVOURABLE
AS TO THE MOUTH IT DELIGHTS AT TIMES IN LAUGHTER IT IS DISPOSED TO
IMPART ALL THAT THE BRAIN CONCEIVES THOUGH I DARESAY IT WOULD BE SILENT
ON MUCH THE HEART EXPERIENCES
MOBILE AND FLEXIBLE IT WAS NEVER
INTENDED TO BE COMPRESSED IN THE ETERNAL SILENCE OF SOLITUDE IT IS A
MOUTH WHICH SHOULD SPEAK MUCH AND SMILE OFTEN AND HAVE HUMAN AFFECTION
FOR ITS INTERLOCUTOR
THAT FEATURE TOO IS PROPITIOUS
I SEE NO ENEMY TO A FORTUNATE ISSUE BUT IN THE BROW AND THAT BROW
PROFESSES TO SAY 'I CAN LIVE ALONE IF SELF RESPECT AND CIRCUMSTANCES
REQUIRE ME SO TO DO
I NEED NOT SELL MY SOUL TO BUY BLISS
I HAVE AN
INWARD TREASURE BORN WITH ME WHICH CAN KEEP ME ALIVE IF ALL EXTRANEOUS
DELIGHTS SHOULD BE WITHHELD OR OFFERED ONLY AT A PRICE I CANNOT AFFORD
TO GIVE THE FOREHEAD DECLARES 'REASON SITS FIRM AND HOLDS THE REINS
AND SHE WILL NOT LET THE FEELINGS BURST AWAY AND HURRY HER TO WILD
CHASMS
THE PASSIONS MAY RAGE FURIOUSLY LIKE TRUE HEATHENS AS THEY
ARE AND THE DESIRES MAY IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF VAIN THINGS BUT JUDGMENT
SHALL STILL HAVE THE LAST WORD IN EVERY ARGUMENT AND THE CASTING VOTE IN
EVERY DECISION
STRONG WIND EARTHQUAKE SHOCK AND FIRE MAY PASS BY BUT
I SHALL FOLLOW THE GUIDING OF THAT STILL SMALL VOICE WHICH INTERPRETS THE
DICTATES OF CONSCIENCE
WELL SAID FOREHEAD YOUR DECLARATION SHALL BE RESPECTED
I HAVE FORMED
MY PLANS RIGHT PLANS I DEEM THEM AND IN THEM I HAVE ATTENDED TO THE
CLAIMS OF CONSCIENCE THE COUNSELS OF REASON
I KNOW HOW SOON YOUTH
WOULD FADE AND BLOOM PERISH IF IN THE CUP OF BLISS OFFERED BUT ONE
DREG OF SHAME OR ONE FLAVOUR OF REMORSE WERE DETECTED AND I DO NOT WANT
SACRIFICE SORROW DISSOLUTION SUCH IS NOT MY TASTE
I WISH TO FOSTER
NOT TO BLIGHT TO EARN GRATITUDE NOT TO WRING TEARS OF BLOOD NO NOR OF
BRINE MY HARVEST MUST BE IN SMILES IN ENDEARMENTS IN SWEET THAT WILL
DO
I THINK I RAVE IN A KIND OF EXQUISITE DELIRIUM
I SHOULD WISH NOW
TO PROTRACT THIS MOMENT AD INFINITUM BUT I DARE NOT
SO FAR I HAVE
GOVERNED MYSELF THOROUGHLY
I HAVE ACTED AS I INWARDLY SWORE I WOULD
ACT BUT FURTHER MIGHT TRY ME BEYOND MY STRENGTH
RISE MISS EYRE LEAVE
ME THE PLAY IS PLAYED OUT'
WHERE WAS I DID I WAKE OR SLEEP HAD I BEEN DREAMING DID I DREAM
STILL THE OLD WOMAN'S VOICE HAD CHANGED HER ACCENT HER GESTURE AND
ALL WERE FAMILIAR TO ME AS MY OWN FACE IN A GLASS AS THE SPEECH OF MY
OWN TONGUE
I GOT UP BUT DID NOT GO
I LOOKED I STIRRED THE FIRE AND
I LOOKED AGAIN BUT SHE DREW HER BONNET AND HER BANDAGE CLOSER ABOUT HER
FACE AND AGAIN BECKONED ME TO DEPART
THE FLAME ILLUMINATED HER HAND
STRETCHED OUT ROUSED NOW AND ON THE ALERT FOR DISCOVERIES I AT ONCE
NOTICED THAT HAND
IT WAS NO MORE THE WITHERED LIMB OF ELD THAN MY OWN
IT WAS A ROUNDED SUPPLE MEMBER WITH SMOOTH FINGERS SYMMETRICALLY
TURNED A BROAD RING FLASHED ON THE LITTLE FINGER AND STOOPING FORWARD
I LOOKED AT IT AND SAW A GEM I HAD SEEN A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE
AGAIN I
LOOKED AT THE FACE WHICH WAS NO LONGER TURNED FROM ME ON THE CONTRARY
THE BONNET WAS DOFFED THE BANDAGE DISPLACED THE HEAD ADVANCED
WELL JANE DO YOU KNOW ME ASKED THE FAMILIAR VOICE
ONLY TAKE OFF THE RED CLOAK SIR AND THEN
BUT THE STRING IS IN A KNOT HELP ME
BREAK IT SIR
THERE THEN 'OFF YE LENDINGS AND MR
ROCHESTER STEPPED OUT OF HIS
DISGUISE
NOW SIR WHAT A STRANGE IDEA
BUT WELL CARRIED OUT EH DON'T YOU THINK SO
WITH THE LADIES YOU MUST HAVE MANAGED WELL
BUT NOT WITH YOU
YOU DID NOT ACT THE CHARACTER OF A GIPSY WITH ME
WHAT CHARACTER DID I ACT MY OWN
NO SOME UNACCOUNTABLE ONE
IN SHORT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
DRAW ME OUT OR IN YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING NONSENSE TO MAKE ME TALK
NONSENSE
IT IS SCARCELY FAIR SIR
DO YOU FORGIVE ME JANE
I CANNOT TELL TILL I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER
IF ON REFLECTION I
FIND I HAVE FALLEN INTO NO GREAT ABSURDITY I SHALL TRY TO FORGIVE YOU
BUT IT WAS NOT RIGHT
OH YOU HAVE BEEN VERY CORRECT VERY CAREFUL VERY SENSIBLE
I REFLECTED AND THOUGHT ON THE WHOLE I HAD
IT WAS A COMFORT BUT
INDEED I HAD BEEN ON MY GUARD ALMOST FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE
INTERVIEW
SOMETHING OF MASQUERADE I SUSPECTED
I KNEW GIPSIES AND
FORTUNE TELLERS DID NOT EXPRESS THEMSELVES AS THIS SEEMING OLD WOMAN HAD
EXPRESSED HERSELF BESIDES I HAD NOTED HER FEIGNED VOICE HER ANXIETY TO
CONCEAL HER FEATURES
BUT MY MIND HAD BEEN RUNNING ON GRACE POOLE THAT
LIVING ENIGMA THAT MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES AS I CONSIDERED HER
I HAD
NEVER THOUGHT OF MR
ROCHESTER
WELL SAID HE WHAT ARE YOU MUSING ABOUT WHAT DOES THAT GRAVE SMILE

SPEAKING AUTOMATON TO ENOUNCE ITS SINGLE WORDS MASON THE WEST
INDIES HE REITERATED AND HE WENT OVER THE SYLLABLES THREE TIMES
GROWING IN THE INTERVALS OF SPEAKING WHITER THAN ASHES HE HARDLY
SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING

ARRANGED ON THE SIDEBOARD EACH HAD TAKEN WHAT HE CHOSE AND THEY STOOD
ABOUT HERE AND THERE IN GROUPS THEIR PLATES AND GLASSES IN THEIR HANDS
EVERY ONE SEEMED IN HIGH GLEE LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION WERE GENERAL AND
ANIMATED
MR
MASON STOOD NEAR THE FIRE TALKING TO COLONEL AND MRS
DENT AND APPEARED AS MERRY AS ANY OF THEM
I FILLED A WINE GLASS I SAW
MISS INGRAM WATCH ME FROWNINGLY AS I DID SO SHE THOUGHT I WAS TAKING A
LIBERTY I DARESAY AND I RETURNED TO THE LIBRARY
MR
ROCHESTER'S EXTREME PALLOR HAD DISAPPEARED AND HE LOOKED ONCE MORE
FIRM AND STERN
HE TOOK THE GLASS FROM MY HAND
HERE IS TO YOUR HEALTH MINISTRANT SPIRIT HE SAID
HE SWALLOWED THE
CONTENTS AND RETURNED IT TO ME

LAUGHING AND TALKING SIR
THEY DON'T LOOK GRAVE AND MYSTERIOUS AS IF THEY HAD HEARD SOMETHING
STRANGE
NOT AT ALL THEY ARE FULL OF JESTS AND GAIETY
AND MASON
HE WAS LAUGHING TOO
IF ALL THESE PEOPLE CAME IN A BODY AND SPAT AT ME WHAT WOULD YOU DO
JANE
TURN THEM OUT OF THE ROOM SIR IF I COULD
HE HALF SMILED
BUT IF I WERE TO GO TO THEM AND THEY ONLY LOOKED AT ME
COLDLY AND WHISPERED SNEERINGLY AMONGST EACH OTHER AND THEN DROPPED OFF
AND LEFT ME ONE BY ONE WHAT THEN WOULD YOU GO WITH THEM
I RATHER THINK NOT SIR I SHOULD HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN STAYING WITH
YOU
TO COMFORT ME
YES SIR TO COMFORT YOU AS WELL AS I COULD
AND IF THEY LAID YOU UNDER A BAN FOR ADHERING TO ME
I PROBABLY SHOULD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEIR BAN AND IF I DID I SHOULD
CARE NOTHING ABOUT IT

YOU I AM SURE DO
GO BACK NOW INTO THE ROOM STEP QUIETLY UP TO MASON AND WHISPER IN HIS
EAR THAT MR
ROCHESTER IS COME AND WISHES TO SEE HIM SHOW HIM IN HERE
AND THEN LEAVE ME
YES SIR
I DID HIS BEHEST
THE COMPANY ALL STARED AT ME AS I PASSED STRAIGHT
AMONG THEM
I SOUGHT MR
MASON DELIVERED THE MESSAGE AND PRECEDED HIM
FROM THE ROOM I USHERED HIM INTO THE LIBRARY AND THEN I WENT UPSTAIRS
AT A LATE HOUR AFTER I HAD BEEN IN BED SOME TIME I HEARD THE VISITORS
REPAIR TO THEIR CHAMBERS I DISTINGUISHED MR
ROCHESTER'S VOICE AND
HEARD HIM SAY THIS WAY MASON THIS IS YOUR ROOM
HE SPOKE CHEERFULLY THE GAY TONES SET MY HEART AT EASE
I WAS SOON
ASLEEP
CHAPTER XX
I HAD FORGOTTEN TO DRAW MY CURTAIN WHICH I USUALLY DID AND ALSO TO LET
DOWN MY WINDOW BLIND
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT WHEN THE MOON WHICH WAS
FULL AND BRIGHT FOR THE NIGHT WAS FINE CAME IN HER COURSE TO THAT
SPACE IN THE SKY OPPOSITE MY CASEMENT AND LOOKED IN AT ME THROUGH THE
UNVEILED PANES HER GLORIOUS GAZE ROUSED ME
AWAKING IN THE DEAD OF
NIGHT I OPENED MY EYES ON HER DISK SILVER WHITE AND CRYSTAL CLEAR
IT
WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT TOO SOLEMN I HALF ROSE AND STRETCHED MY ARM TO DRAW
THE CURTAIN
GOOD GOD WHAT A CRY
THE NIGHT ITS SILENCE ITS REST WAS RENT IN TWAIN BY A SAVAGE A SHARP
A SHRILLY SOUND THAT RAN FROM END TO END OF THORNFIELD HALL
MY PULSE STOPPED MY HEART STOOD STILL MY STRETCHED ARM WAS PARALYSED
THE CRY DIED AND WAS NOT RENEWED
INDEED WHATEVER BEING UTTERED THAT
FEARFUL SHRIEK COULD NOT SOON REPEAT IT NOT THE WIDEST WINGED CONDOR ON
THE ANDES COULD TWICE IN SUCCESSION SEND OUT SUCH A YELL FROM THE CLOUD
SHROUDING HIS EYRIE
THE THING DELIVERING SUCH UTTERANCE MUST REST ERE
IT COULD REPEAT THE EFFORT
IT CAME OUT OF THE THIRD STOREY FOR IT PASSED OVERHEAD
AND
OVERHEAD YES IN THE ROOM JUST ABOVE MY CHAMBER CEILING I NOW HEARD A
STRUGGLE A DEADLY ONE IT SEEMED FROM THE NOISE AND A HALF SMOTHERED
VOICE SHOUTED
HELP HELP HELP THREE TIMES RAPIDLY
WILL NO ONE COME IT CRIED AND THEN WHILE THE STAGGERING AND STAMPING
WENT ON WILDLY I DISTINGUISHED THROUGH PLANK AND PLASTER
ROCHESTER ROCHESTER FOR GOD'S SAKE COME
A CHAMBER DOOR OPENED SOME ONE RAN OR RUSHED ALONG THE GALLERY
ANOTHER STEP STAMPED ON THE FLOORING ABOVE AND SOMETHING FELL AND THERE
WAS SILENCE
I HAD PUT ON SOME CLOTHES THOUGH HORROR SHOOK ALL MY LIMBS I ISSUED
FROM MY APARTMENT
THE SLEEPERS WERE ALL AROUSED EJACULATIONS
TERRIFIED MURMURS SOUNDED IN EVERY ROOM DOOR AFTER DOOR UNCLOSED ONE
LOOKED OUT AND ANOTHER LOOKED OUT THE GALLERY FILLED
GENTLEMEN AND
LADIES ALIKE HAD QUITTED THEIR BEDS AND OH WHAT IS IT WHO IS
HURT WHAT HAS HAPPENED FETCH A LIGHT IS IT FIRE ARE THERE
ROBBERS WHERE SHALL WE RUN WAS DEMANDED CONFUSEDLY ON ALL HANDS
BUT FOR THE MOONLIGHT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN COMPLETE DARKNESS
THEY
RAN TO AND FRO THEY CROWDED TOGETHER SOME SOBBED SOME STUMBLED THE
CONFUSION WAS INEXTRICABLE
WHERE THE DEVIL IS ROCHESTER CRIED COLONEL DENT
I CANNOT FIND HIM
IN HIS BED
HERE HERE WAS SHOUTED IN RETURN
BE COMPOSED ALL OF YOU I'M
COMING
AND THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE GALLERY OPENED AND MR
ROCHESTER ADVANCED
WITH A CANDLE HE HAD JUST DESCENDED FROM THE UPPER STOREY
ONE OF THE
LADIES RAN TO HIM DIRECTLY SHE SEIZED HIS ARM IT WAS MISS INGRAM
WHAT AWFUL EVENT HAS TAKEN PLACE SAID SHE
SPEAK LET US KNOW THE
WORST AT ONCE
BUT DON'T PULL ME DOWN OR STRANGLE ME HE REPLIED FOR THE MISSES
ESHTON WERE CLINGING ABOUT HIM NOW AND THE TWO DOWAGERS IN VAST WHITE
WRAPPERS WERE BEARING DOWN ON HIM LIKE SHIPS IN FULL SAIL
ALL'S RIGHT ALL'S RIGHT HE CRIED
IT'S A MERE REHEARSAL OF MUCH
ADO ABOUT NOTHING
LADIES KEEP OFF OR I SHALL WAX DANGEROUS
AND DANGEROUS HE LOOKED HIS BLACK EYES DARTED SPARKS
CALMING HIMSELF
BY AN EFFORT HE ADDED
A SERVANT HAS HAD THE NIGHTMARE THAT IS ALL
SHE'S AN EXCITABLE
NERVOUS PERSON SHE CONSTRUED HER DREAM INTO AN APPARITION OR SOMETHING
OF THAT SORT NO DOUBT AND HAS TAKEN A FIT WITH FRIGHT
NOW THEN I
MUST SEE YOU ALL BACK INTO YOUR ROOMS FOR TILL THE HOUSE IS SETTLED
SHE CANNOT BE LOOKED AFTER
GENTLEMEN HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SET THE
LADIES THE EXAMPLE
MISS INGRAM I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT FAIL IN EVINCING
SUPERIORITY TO IDLE TERRORS
AMY AND LOUISA RETURN TO YOUR NESTS LIKE A
PAIR OF DOVES AS YOU ARE
MESDAMES TO THE DOWAGERS YOU WILL TAKE
COLD TO A DEAD CERTAINTY IF YOU STAY IN THIS CHILL GALLERY ANY LONGER
AND SO BY DINT OF ALTERNATE COAXING AND COMMANDING HE CONTRIVED TO GET
THEM ALL ONCE MORE ENCLOSED IN THEIR SEPARATE DORMITORIES
I DID NOT
WAIT TO BE ORDERED BACK TO MINE BUT RETREATED UNNOTICED AS UNNOTICED I
HAD LEFT IT
NOT HOWEVER TO GO TO BED ON THE CONTRARY I BEGAN AND DRESSED MYSELF
CAREFULLY
THE SOUNDS I HAD HEARD AFTER THE SCREAM AND THE WORDS THAT
HAD BEEN UTTERED HAD PROBABLY BEEN HEARD ONLY BY ME FOR THEY HAD
PROCEEDED FROM THE ROOM ABOVE MINE BUT THEY ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT A
SERVANT'S DREAM WHICH HAD THUS STRUCK HORROR THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THAT
THE EXPLANATION MR
ROCHESTER HAD GIVEN WAS MERELY AN INVENTION FRAMED TO
PACIFY HIS GUESTS
I DRESSED THEN TO BE READY FOR EMERGENCIES
WHEN
DRESSED I SAT A LONG TIME BY THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT OVER THE SILENT
GROUNDS AND SILVERED FIELDS AND WAITING FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT
IT SEEMED
TO ME THAT SOME EVENT MUST FOLLOW THE STRANGE CRY STRUGGLE AND CALL
NO STILLNESS RETURNED EACH MURMUR AND MOVEMENT CEASED GRADUALLY AND IN
ABOUT AN HOUR THORNFIELD HALL WAS AGAIN AS HUSHED AS A DESERT
IT SEEMED
THAT SLEEP AND NIGHT HAD RESUMED THEIR EMPIRE
MEANTIME THE MOON
DECLINED SHE WAS ABOUT TO SET
NOT LIKING TO SIT IN THE COLD AND
DARKNESS I THOUGHT I WOULD LIE DOWN ON MY BED DRESSED AS I WAS
I LEFT
THE WINDOW AND MOVED WITH LITTLE NOISE ACROSS THE CARPET AS I STOOPED
TO TAKE OFF MY SHOES A CAUTIOUS HAND TAPPED LOW AT THE DOOR
AM I WANTED I ASKED
ARE YOU UP ASKED THE VOICE I EXPECTED TO HEAR VIZ MY MASTER'S
YES SIR
AND DRESSED
YES
COME OUT THEN QUIETLY
I OBEYED
MR
ROCHESTER STOOD IN THE GALLERY HOLDING A LIGHT
I WANT YOU HE SAID COME THIS WAY TAKE YOUR TIME AND MAKE NO
NOISE
MY SLIPPERS WERE THIN I COULD WALK THE MATTED FLOOR AS SOFTLY AS A CAT
HE GLIDED UP THE GALLERY AND UP THE STAIRS AND STOPPED IN THE DARK LOW
CORRIDOR OF THE FATEFUL THIRD STOREY I HAD FOLLOWED AND STOOD AT HIS
SIDE
HAVE YOU A SPONGE IN YOUR ROOM HE ASKED IN A WHISPER
YES SIR
HAVE YOU ANY SALTS VOLATILE SALTS
YES
GO BACK AND FETCH BOTH
I RETURNED SOUGHT THE SPONGE ON THE WASHSTAND THE SALTS IN MY DRAWER
AND ONCE MORE RETRACED MY STEPS
HE STILL WAITED HE HELD A KEY IN HIS
HAND APPROACHING ONE OF THE SMALL BLACK DOORS HE PUT IT IN THE LOCK
HE PAUSED AND ADDRESSED ME AGAIN
YOU DON'T TURN SICK AT THE SIGHT OF BLOOD
I THINK I SHALL NOT I HAVE NEVER BEEN TRIED YET
I FELT A THRILL WHILE I ANSWERED HIM BUT NO COLDNESS AND NO FAINTNESS
JUST GIVE ME YOUR HAND HE SAID IT WILL NOT DO TO RISK A FAINTING
FIT
I PUT MY FINGERS INTO HIS
WARM AND STEADY WAS HIS REMARK HE TURNED
THE KEY AND OPENED THE DOOR
I SAW A ROOM I REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN BEFORE THE DAY MRS
FAIRFAX
SHOWED ME OVER THE HOUSE IT WAS HUNG WITH TAPESTRY BUT THE TAPESTRY WAS
NOW LOOPED UP IN ONE PART AND THERE WAS A DOOR APPARENT WHICH HAD THEN
BEEN CONCEALED
THIS DOOR WAS OPEN A LIGHT SHONE OUT OF THE ROOM
WITHIN I HEARD THENCE A SNARLING SNATCHING SOUND ALMOST LIKE A DOG
QUARRELLING
MR
ROCHESTER PUTTING DOWN HIS CANDLE SAID TO ME WAIT A
MINUTE AND HE WENT FORWARD TO THE INNER APARTMENT
A SHOUT OF LAUGHTER
GREETED HIS ENTRANCE NOISY AT FIRST AND TERMINATING IN GRACE POOLE'S
OWN GOBLIN HA HA SHE THEN WAS THERE
HE MADE SOME SORT OF
ARRANGEMENT WITHOUT SPEAKING THOUGH I HEARD A LOW VOICE ADDRESS HIM HE
CAME OUT AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
HERE JANE HE SAID AND I WALKED ROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF A LARGE
BED WHICH WITH ITS DRAWN CURTAINS CONCEALED A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF
THE CHAMBER
AN EASY CHAIR WAS NEAR THE BED HEAD A MAN SAT IN IT
DRESSED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIS COAT HE WAS STILL HIS HEAD LEANT
BACK HIS EYES WERE CLOSED
MR
ROCHESTER HELD THE CANDLE OVER HIM I
RECOGNISED IN HIS PALE AND SEEMINGLY LIFELESS FACE THE STRANGER MASON
I SAW TOO THAT HIS LINEN ON ONE SIDE AND ONE ARM WAS ALMOST SOAKED IN
BLOOD
HOLD THE CANDLE SAID MR
ROCHESTER AND I TOOK IT HE FETCHED A BASIN
OF WATER FROM THE WASHSTAND HOLD THAT SAID HE
I OBEYED
HE TOOK
THE SPONGE DIPPED IT IN AND MOISTENED THE CORPSE LIKE FACE HE ASKED
FOR MY SMELLING BOTTLE AND APPLIED IT TO THE NOSTRILS
MR
MASON
SHORTLY UNCLOSED HIS EYES HE GROANED
MR
ROCHESTER OPENED THE SHIRT OF
THE WOUNDED MAN WHOSE ARM AND SHOULDER WERE BANDAGED HE SPONGED AWAY
BLOOD TRICKLING FAST DOWN
IS THERE IMMEDIATE DANGER MURMURED MR
MASON
POOH NO A MERE SCRATCH
DON'T BE SO OVERCOME MAN BEAR UP I'LL
FETCH A SURGEON FOR YOU NOW MYSELF YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BE REMOVED BY
MORNING I HOPE
JANE HE CONTINUED
SIR
I SHALL HAVE TO LEAVE YOU IN THIS ROOM WITH THIS GENTLEMAN FOR AN HOUR
OR PERHAPS TWO HOURS YOU WILL SPONGE THE BLOOD AS I DO WHEN IT RETURNS
IF HE FEELS FAINT YOU WILL PUT THE GLASS OF WATER ON THAT STAND TO HIS
LIPS AND YOUR SALTS TO HIS NOSE
YOU WILL NOT SPEAK TO HIM ON ANY
PRETEXT AND RICHARD IT WILL BE AT THE PERIL OF YOUR LIFE IF YOU SPEAK
TO HER OPEN YOUR LIPS AGITATE YOURSELF AND I'LL NOT ANSWER FOR THE
CONSEQUENCES
AGAIN THE POOR MAN GROANED HE LOOKED AS IF HE DARED NOT MOVE FEAR
EITHER OF DEATH OR OF SOMETHING ELSE APPEARED ALMOST TO PARALYSE HIM
MR
ROCHESTER PUT THE NOW BLOODY SPONGE INTO MY HAND AND I PROCEEDED TO
USE IT AS HE HAD DONE
HE WATCHED ME A SECOND THEN SAYING
REMEMBER NO CONVERSATION HE LEFT THE ROOM
I EXPERIENCED A STRANGE
FEELING AS THE KEY GRATED IN THE LOCK AND THE SOUND OF HIS RETREATING
STEP CEASED TO BE HEARD
HERE THEN I WAS IN THE THIRD STOREY FASTENED INTO ONE OF ITS MYSTIC
CELLS NIGHT AROUND ME A PALE AND BLOODY SPECTACLE UNDER MY EYES AND
HANDS A MURDERESS HARDLY SEPARATED FROM ME BY A SINGLE DOOR YES THAT
WAS APPALLING THE REST I COULD BEAR BUT I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT OF
GRACE POOLE BURSTING OUT UPON ME
I MUST KEEP TO MY POST HOWEVER
I MUST WATCH THIS GHASTLY
COUNTENANCE THESE BLUE STILL LIPS FORBIDDEN TO UNCLOSE THESE EYES NOW
SHUT NOW OPENING NOW WANDERING THROUGH THE ROOM NOW FIXING ON ME AND
EVER GLAZED WITH THE DULNESS OF HORROR
I MUST DIP MY HAND AGAIN AND
AGAIN IN THE BASIN OF BLOOD AND WATER AND WIPE AWAY THE TRICKLING GORE
I MUST SEE THE LIGHT OF THE UNSNUFFED CANDLE WANE ON MY EMPLOYMENT THE
SHADOWS DARKEN ON THE WROUGHT ANTIQUE TAPESTRY ROUND ME AND GROW BLACK
UNDER THE HANGINGS OF THE VAST OLD BED AND QUIVER STRANGELY OVER THE
DOORS OF A GREAT CABINET OPPOSITE WHOSE FRONT DIVIDED INTO TWELVE
PANELS BORE IN GRIM DESIGN THE HEADS OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES EACH
ENCLOSED IN ITS SEPARATE PANEL AS IN A FRAME WHILE ABOVE THEM AT THE TOP
ROSE AN EBON CRUCIFIX AND A DYING CHRIST
ACCORDING AS THE SHIFTING OBSCURITY AND FLICKERING GLEAM HOVERED HERE OR
GLANCED THERE IT WAS NOW THE BEARDED PHYSICIAN LUKE THAT BENT HIS
BROW NOW ST
JOHN'S LONG HAIR THAT WAVED AND ANON THE DEVILISH FACE OF
JUDAS THAT GREW OUT OF THE PANEL AND SEEMED GATHERING LIFE AND
THREATENING A REVELATION OF THE ARCH TRAITOR OF SATAN HIMSELF IN HIS
SUBORDINATE'S FORM
AMIDST ALL THIS I HAD TO LISTEN AS WELL AS WATCH TO LISTEN FOR THE
MOVEMENTS OF THE WILD BEAST OR THE FIEND IN YONDER SIDE DEN
BUT SINCE
MR
ROCHESTER'S VISIT IT SEEMED SPELLBOUND ALL THE NIGHT I HEARD BUT
THREE SOUNDS AT THREE LONG INTERVALS A STEP CREAK A MOMENTARY RENEWAL
OF THE SNARLING CANINE NOISE AND A DEEP HUMAN GROAN
THEN MY OWN THOUGHTS WORRIED ME
WHAT CRIME WAS THIS THAT LIVED
INCARNATE IN THIS SEQUESTERED MANSION AND COULD NEITHER BE EXPELLED NOR
SUBDUED BY THE OWNER WHAT MYSTERY THAT BROKE OUT NOW IN FIRE AND NOW
IN BLOOD AT THE DEADEST HOURS OF NIGHT WHAT CREATURE WAS IT THAT
MASKED IN AN ORDINARY WOMAN'S FACE AND SHAPE UTTERED THE VOICE NOW OF A
MOCKING DEMON AND ANON OF A CARRION SEEKING BIRD OF PREY
AND THIS MAN I BENT OVER THIS COMMONPLACE QUIET STRANGER HOW HAD HE
BECOME INVOLVED IN THE WEB OF HORROR AND WHY HAD THE FURY FLOWN AT HIM
WHAT MADE HIM SEEK THIS QUARTER OF THE HOUSE AT AN UNTIMELY SEASON WHEN
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASLEEP IN BED I HAD HEARD MR
ROCHESTER ASSIGN HIM
AN APARTMENT BELOW WHAT BROUGHT HIM HERE AND WHY NOW WAS HE SO TAME
UNDER THE VIOLENCE OR TREACHERY DONE HIM WHY DID HE SO QUIETLY SUBMIT
TO THE CONCEALMENT MR
ROCHESTER ENFORCED WHY DID MR
ROCHESTER
ENFORCE THIS CONCEALMENT HIS GUEST HAD BEEN OUTRAGED HIS OWN LIFE ON A
FORMER OCCASION HAD BEEN HIDEOUSLY PLOTTED AGAINST AND BOTH ATTEMPTS HE
SMOTHERED IN SECRECY AND SANK IN OBLIVION LASTLY I SAW MR
MASON WAS
SUBMISSIVE TO MR
ROCHESTER THAT THE IMPETUOUS WILL OF THE LATTER HELD
COMPLETE SWAY OVER THE INERTNESS OF THE FORMER THE FEW WORDS WHICH HAD
PASSED BETWEEN THEM ASSURED ME OF THIS
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IN THEIR
FORMER INTERCOURSE THE PASSIVE DISPOSITION OF THE ONE HAD BEEN
HABITUALLY INFLUENCED BY THE ACTIVE ENERGY OF THE OTHER WHENCE THEN HAD
ARISEN MR
ROCHESTER'S DISMAY WHEN HE HEARD OF MR
MASON'S ARRIVAL WHY
HAD THE MERE NAME OF THIS UNRESISTING INDIVIDUAL WHOM HIS WORD NOW
SUFFICED TO CONTROL LIKE A CHILD FALLEN ON HIM A FEW HOURS SINCE AS A
THUNDERBOLT MIGHT FALL ON AN OAK
OH I COULD NOT FORGET HIS LOOK AND HIS PALENESS WHEN HE WHISPERED
JANE I HAVE GOT A BLOW I HAVE GOT A BLOW JANE I COULD NOT FORGET
HOW THE ARM HAD TREMBLED WHICH HE RESTED ON MY SHOULDER AND IT WAS NO
LIGHT MATTER WHICH COULD THUS BOW THE RESOLUTE SPIRIT AND THRILL THE
VIGOROUS FRAME OF FAIRFAX ROCHESTER
WHEN WILL HE COME WHEN WILL HE COME I CRIED INWARDLY AS THE NIGHT
LINGERED AND LINGERED AS MY BLEEDING PATIENT DROOPED MOANED SICKENED
AND NEITHER DAY NOR AID ARRIVED
I HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN HELD THE WATER
TO MASON'S WHITE LIPS AGAIN AND AGAIN OFFERED HIM THE STIMULATING SALTS
MY EFFORTS SEEMED INEFFECTUAL EITHER BODILY OR MENTAL SUFFERING OR LOSS
OF BLOOD OR ALL THREE COMBINED WERE FAST PROSTRATING HIS STRENGTH
HE
MOANED SO AND LOOKED SO WEAK WILD AND LOST I FEARED HE WAS DYING AND
I MIGHT NOT EVEN SPEAK TO HIM
THE CANDLE WASTED AT LAST WENT OUT AS IT EXPIRED I PERCEIVED STREAKS
OF GREY LIGHT EDGING THE WINDOW CURTAINS DAWN WAS THEN APPROACHING
PRESENTLY I HEARD PILOT BARK FAR BELOW OUT OF HIS DISTANT KENNEL IN THE
COURTYARD HOPE REVIVED
NOR WAS IT UNWARRANTED IN FIVE MINUTES MORE
THE GRATING KEY THE YIELDING LOCK WARNED ME MY WATCH WAS RELIEVED
IT
COULD NOT HAVE LASTED MORE THAN TWO HOURS MANY A WEEK HAS SEEMED
SHORTER
MR
ROCHESTER ENTERED AND WITH HIM THE SURGEON HE HAD BEEN TO FETCH
NOW CARTER BE ON THE ALERT HE SAID TO THIS LAST I GIVE YOU BUT
HALF AN HOUR FOR DRESSING THE WOUND FASTENING THE BANDAGES GETTING THE
PATIENT DOWNSTAIRS AND ALL
BUT IS HE FIT TO MOVE SIR
NO DOUBT OF IT IT IS NOTHING SERIOUS HE IS NERVOUS HIS SPIRITS MUST
BE KEPT UP
COME SET TO WORK
MR
ROCHESTER DREW BACK THE THICK CURTAIN DREW UP THE HOLLAND BLIND LET
IN ALL THE DAYLIGHT HE COULD AND I WAS SURPRISED AND CHEERED TO SEE HOW
FAR DAWN WAS ADVANCED WHAT ROSY STREAKS WERE BEGINNING TO BRIGHTEN THE
EAST
THEN HE APPROACHED MASON WHOM THE SURGEON WAS ALREADY HANDLING
NOW MY GOOD FELLOW HOW ARE YOU HE ASKED
SHE'S DONE FOR ME I FEAR WAS THE FAINT REPLY
NOT A WHIT COURAGE THIS DAY FORTNIGHT YOU'LL HARDLY BE A PIN THE
WORSE OF IT YOU'VE LOST A LITTLE BLOOD THAT'S ALL
CARTER ASSURE HIM
THERE'S NO DANGER
I CAN DO THAT CONSCIENTIOUSLY SAID CARTER WHO HAD NOW UNDONE THE
BANDAGES ONLY I WISH I COULD HAVE GOT HERE SOONER HE WOULD NOT HAVE
BLED SO MUCH BUT HOW IS THIS THE FLESH ON THE SHOULDER IS TORN AS WELL
AS CUT
THIS WOUND WAS NOT DONE WITH A KNIFE THERE HAVE BEEN TEETH
HERE
SHE BIT ME HE MURMURED
SHE WORRIED ME LIKE A TIGRESS WHEN
ROCHESTER GOT THE KNIFE FROM HER
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE YIELDED YOU SHOULD HAVE GRAPPLED WITH HER AT ONCE
SAID MR
ROCHESTER
BUT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT COULD ONE DO RETURNED MASON
OH

AND I DID NOT EXPECT IT SHE
LOOKED SO QUIET AT FIRST
I WARNED YOU WAS HIS FRIEND'S ANSWER I SAID BE ON YOUR GUARD WHEN

WOUND IN THE ARM SHE HAS HAD HER TEETH HERE TOO I THINK

HORROR HATRED WARPED HIS COUNTENANCE ALMOST TO DISTORTION BUT HE ONLY
SAID

WOLF'S DEN UNGUARDED YOU WERE SAFE

THOUGHTS

NEVER FEAR I WILL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF
IS THE DANGER YOU APPREHENDED LAST NIGHT GONE BY NOW SIR
I CANNOT VOUCH FOR THAT TILL MASON IS OUT OF ENGLAND NOR EVEN THEN

LIVE FOR ME JANE IS TO STAND ON A CRATER CRUST WHICH MAY CRACK AND
SPUE FIRE ANY DAY

YOUR INFLUENCE SIR IS EVIDENTLY
POTENT WITH HIM HE WILL NEVER SET YOU AT DEFIANCE OR WILFULLY INJURE
YOU
OH NO MASON WILL NOT DEFY ME NOR KNOWING IT WILL HE HURT ME BUT
UNINTENTIONALLY HE MIGHT IN A MOMENT BY ONE CARELESS WORD DEPRIVE ME
IF NOT OF LIFE YET FOR EVER OF HAPPINESS
TELL HIM TO BE CAUTIOUS SIR LET HIM KNOW WHAT YOU FEAR AND SHOW HIM
HOW TO AVERT THE DANGER
HE LAUGHED SARDONICALLY HASTILY TOOK MY HAND AND AS HASTILY THREW IT
FROM HIM
IF I COULD DO THAT SIMPLETON WHERE WOULD THE DANGER BE ANNIHILATED
IN A MOMENT
EVER SINCE I HAVE KNOWN MASON I HAVE ONLY HAD TO SAY TO
HIM 'DO THAT AND THE THING HAS BEEN DONE
BUT I CANNOT GIVE HIM ORDERS
IN THIS CASE I CANNOT SAY 'BEWARE OF HARMING ME RICHARD FOR IT IS
IMPERATIVE THAT I SHOULD KEEP HIM IGNORANT THAT HARM TO ME IS POSSIBLE

MIEN YOUR EYE AND FACE WHEN YOU ARE HELPING ME AND PLEASING ME WORKING
FOR ME AND WITH ME IN AS YOU CHARACTERISTICALLY SAY ALL THAT IS
RIGHT FOR IF I BID YOU DO WHAT YOU THOUGHT WRONG THERE WOULD BE NO
LIGHT FOOTED RUNNING NO NEAT HANDED ALACRITY NO LIVELY GLANCE AND
ANIMATED COMPLEXION
MY FRIEND WOULD THEN TURN TO ME QUIET AND PALE

IS WRONG AND WOULD BECOME IMMUTABLE AS A FIXED STAR

UPWARDS IMAGINE YOURSELF IN A REMOTE FOREIGN LAND CONCEIVE THAT YOU
THERE COMMIT A CAPITAL ERROR NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE OR FROM WHAT
MOTIVES BUT ONE WHOSE CONSEQUENCES MUST FOLLOW YOU THROUGH LIFE AND
TAINT ALL YOUR EXISTENCE
MIND I DON'T SAY A CRIME I AM NOT SPEAKING
OF SHEDDING OF BLOOD OR ANY OTHER GUILTY ACT WHICH MIGHT MAKE THE
PERPETRATOR AMENABLE TO THE LAW MY WORD IS ERROR
THE RESULTS OF WHAT
YOU HAVE DONE BECOME IN TIME TO YOU UTTERLY INSUPPORTABLE YOU TAKE
MEASURES TO OBTAIN RELIEF UNUSUAL MEASURES BUT NEITHER UNLAWFUL NOR
CULPABLE
STILL YOU ARE MISERABLE FOR HOPE HAS QUITTED YOU ON THE VERY
CONFINES OF LIFE YOUR SUN AT NOON DARKENS IN AN ECLIPSE WHICH YOU FEEL
WILL NOT LEAVE IT TILL THE TIME OF SETTING
BITTER AND BASE ASSOCIATIONS
HAVE BECOME THE SOLE FOOD OF YOUR MEMORY YOU WANDER HERE AND THERE
SEEKING REST IN EXILE HAPPINESS IN PLEASURE I MEAN IN HEARTLESS
SENSUAL PLEASURE SUCH AS DULLS INTELLECT AND BLIGHTS FEELING

TO ATTAIN THIS
END ARE YOU JUSTIFIED IN OVERLEAPING AN OBSTACLE OF CUSTOM A MERE
CONVENTIONAL IMPEDIMENT WHICH NEITHER YOUR CONSCIENCE SANCTIFIES NOR YOUR
JUDGMENT APPROVES
HE PAUSED FOR AN ANSWER AND WHAT WAS I TO SAY OH FOR SOME GOOD SPIRIT
TO SUGGEST A JUDICIOUS AND SATISFACTORY RESPONSE VAIN ASPIRATION THE
WEST WIND WHISPERED IN THE IVY ROUND ME BUT NO GENTLE ARIEL BORROWED ITS
BREATH AS A MEDIUM OF SPEECH THE BIRDS SANG IN THE TREE TOPS BUT THEIR
SONG HOWEVER SWEET WAS INARTICULATE
AGAIN MR
ROCHESTER PROPOUNDED HIS QUERY
IS THE WANDERING AND SINFUL BUT NOW REST SEEKING AND REPENTANT MAN
JUSTIFIED IN DARING THE WORLD'S OPINION IN ORDER TO ATTACH TO HIM FOR
EVER THIS GENTLE GRACIOUS GENIAL STRANGER THEREBY SECURING HIS OWN
PEACE OF MIND AND REGENERATION OF LIFE
SIR I ANSWERED A WANDERER'S REPOSE OR A SINNER'S REFORMATION SHOULD
NEVER DEPEND ON A FELLOW CREATURE
MEN AND WOMEN DIE PHILOSOPHERS
FALTER IN WISDOM AND CHRISTIANS IN GOODNESS IF ANY ONE YOU KNOW HAS
SUFFERED AND ERRED LET HIM LOOK HIGHER THAN HIS EQUALS FOR STRENGTH TO
AMEND AND SOLACE TO HEAL
BUT THE INSTRUMENT THE INSTRUMENT GOD WHO DOES THE WORK ORDAINS THE
INSTRUMENT
I HAVE MYSELF I TELL IT YOU WITHOUT PARABLE BEEN A
WORLDLY DISSIPATED RESTLESS MAN AND I BELIEVE I HAVE FOUND THE
INSTRUMENT FOR MY CURE IN
HE PAUSED THE BIRDS WENT ON CAROLLING THE LEAVES LIGHTLY RUSTLING
I
ALMOST WONDERED THEY DID NOT CHECK THEIR SONGS AND WHISPERS TO CATCH THE
SUSPENDED REVELATION BUT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO WAIT MANY MINUTES SO
LONG WAS THE SILENCE PROTRACTED
AT LAST I LOOKED UP AT THE TARDY
SPEAKER HE WAS LOOKING EAGERLY AT ME
LITTLE FRIEND SAID HE IN QUITE A CHANGED TONE WHILE HIS FACE CHANGED
TOO LOSING ALL ITS SOFTNESS AND GRAVITY AND BECOMING HARSH AND
SARCASTIC YOU HAVE NOTICED MY TENDER PENCHANT FOR MISS INGRAM DON'T
YOU THINK IF I MARRIED HER SHE WOULD REGENERATE ME WITH A VENGEANCE
HE GOT UP INSTANTLY WENT QUITE TO THE OTHER END OF THE WALK AND WHEN HE
CAME BACK HE WAS HUMMING A TUNE
JANE JANE SAID HE STOPPING BEFORE ME YOU ARE QUITE PALE WITH YOUR
VIGILS DON'T YOU CURSE ME FOR DISTURBING YOUR REST
CURSE YOU NO SIR
SHAKE HANDS IN CONFIRMATION OF THE WORD
WHAT COLD FINGERS THEY WERE
WARMER LAST NIGHT WHEN I TOUCHED THEM AT THE DOOR OF THE MYSTERIOUS
CHAMBER
JANE WHEN WILL YOU WATCH WITH ME AGAIN
WHENEVER I CAN BE USEFUL SIR
FOR INSTANCE THE NIGHT BEFORE I AM MARRIED I AM SURE I SHALL NOT BE
ABLE TO SLEEP

SUCH AS THE LADIES OF CARTHAGE MUST HAVE HAD
BLESS ME THERE'S DENT AND
LYNN IN THE STABLES GO IN BY THE SHRUBBERY THROUGH THAT WICKET
AS I WENT ONE WAY HE WENT ANOTHER AND I HEARD HIM IN THE YARD SAYING
CHEERFULLY
MASON GOT THE START OF YOU ALL THIS MORNING HE WAS GONE BEFORE SUNRISE
I ROSE AT FOUR TO SEE HIM OFF
CHAPTER XXI
PRESENTIMENTS ARE STRANGE THINGS AND SO ARE SYMPATHIES AND SO ARE
SIGNS AND THE THREE COMBINED MAKE ONE MYSTERY TO WHICH HUMANITY HAS NOT
YET FOUND THE KEY
I NEVER LAUGHED AT PRESENTIMENTS IN MY LIFE BECAUSE
I HAVE HAD STRANGE ONES OF MY OWN
SYMPATHIES I BELIEVE EXIST FOR
INSTANCE BETWEEN FAR DISTANT LONG ABSENT WHOLLY ESTRANGED RELATIVES
ASSERTING NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR ALIENATION THE UNITY OF THE SOURCE TO
WHICH EACH TRACES HIS ORIGIN WHOSE WORKINGS BAFFLE MORTAL COMPREHENSION
AND SIGNS FOR AUGHT WE KNOW MAY BE BUT THE SYMPATHIES OF NATURE WITH
MAN
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL ONLY SIX YEARS OLD I ONE NIGHT HEARD BESSIE
LEAVEN SAY TO MARTHA ABBOT THAT SHE HAD BEEN DREAMING ABOUT A LITTLE
CHILD AND THAT TO DREAM OF CHILDREN WAS A SURE SIGN OF TROUBLE EITHER
TO ONE'S SELF OR ONE'S KIN
THE SAYING MIGHT HAVE WORN OUT OF MY MEMORY
HAD NOT A CIRCUMSTANCE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED WHICH SERVED INDELIBLY TO FIX
IT THERE
THE NEXT DAY BESSIE WAS SENT FOR HOME TO THE DEATHBED OF HER
LITTLE SISTER
OF LATE I HAD OFTEN RECALLED THIS SAYING AND THIS INCIDENT FOR DURING
THE PAST WEEK SCARCELY A NIGHT HAD GONE OVER MY COUCH THAT HAD NOT
BROUGHT WITH IT A DREAM OF AN INFANT WHICH I SOMETIMES HUSHED IN MY
ARMS SOMETIMES DANDLED ON MY KNEE SOMETIMES WATCHED PLAYING WITH
DAISIES ON A LAWN OR AGAIN DABBLING ITS HANDS IN RUNNING WATER
IT WAS
A WAILING CHILD THIS NIGHT AND A LAUGHING ONE THE NEXT NOW IT NESTLED
CLOSE TO ME AND NOW IT RAN FROM ME BUT WHATEVER MOOD THE APPARITION
EVINCED WHATEVER ASPECT IT WORE IT FAILED NOT FOR SEVEN SUCCESSIVE
NIGHTS TO MEET ME THE MOMENT I ENTERED THE LAND OF SLUMBER
I DID NOT LIKE THIS ITERATION OF ONE IDEA THIS STRANGE RECURRENCE OF ONE
IMAGE AND I GREW NERVOUS AS BEDTIME APPROACHED AND THE HOUR OF THE
VISION DREW NEAR
IT WAS FROM COMPANIONSHIP WITH THIS BABY PHANTOM I HAD
BEEN ROUSED ON THAT MOONLIGHT NIGHT WHEN I HEARD THE CRY AND IT WAS ON
THE AFTERNOON OF THE DAY FOLLOWING I WAS SUMMONED DOWNSTAIRS BY A MESSAGE
THAT SOME ONE WANTED ME IN MRS
FAIRFAX'S ROOM
ON REPAIRING THITHER I
FOUND A MAN WAITING FOR ME HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF A GENTLEMAN'S
SERVANT HE WAS DRESSED IN DEEP MOURNING AND THE HAT HE HELD IN HIS HAND
WAS SURROUNDED WITH A CRAPE BAND
I DARESAY YOU HARDLY REMEMBER ME MISS HE SAID RISING AS I ENTERED
BUT MY NAME IS LEAVEN I LIVED COACHMAN WITH MRS
REED WHEN YOU WERE AT
GATESHEAD EIGHT OR NINE YEARS SINCE AND I LIVE THERE STILL
OH ROBERT HOW DO YOU DO I REMEMBER YOU VERY WELL YOU USED TO GIVE
ME A RIDE SOMETIMES ON MISS GEORGIANA'S BAY PONY
AND HOW IS BESSIE YOU
ARE MARRIED TO BESSIE
YES MISS MY WIFE IS VERY HEARTY THANK YOU SHE BROUGHT ME ANOTHER
LITTLE ONE ABOUT TWO MONTHS SINCE WE HAVE THREE NOW AND BOTH MOTHER AND
CHILD ARE THRIVING
AND ARE THE FAMILY WELL AT THE HOUSE ROBERT
I AM SORRY I CAN'T GIVE YOU BETTER NEWS OF THEM MISS THEY ARE VERY
BADLY AT PRESENT IN GREAT TROUBLE
I HOPE NO ONE IS DEAD I SAID GLANCING AT HIS BLACK DRESS
HE TOO
LOOKED DOWN AT THE CRAPE ROUND HIS HAT AND REPLIED
MR
JOHN DIED YESTERDAY WAS A WEEK AT HIS CHAMBERS IN LONDON
MR
JOHN
YES
AND HOW DOES HIS MOTHER BEAR IT
WHY YOU SEE MISS EYRE IT IS NOT A COMMON MISHAP HIS LIFE HAS BEEN
VERY WILD THESE LAST THREE YEARS HE GAVE HIMSELF UP TO STRANGE WAYS AND
HIS DEATH WAS SHOCKING
I HEARD FROM BESSIE HE WAS NOT DOING WELL
DOING WELL HE COULD NOT DO WORSE HE RUINED HIS HEALTH AND HIS ESTATE
AMONGST THE WORST MEN AND THE WORST WOMEN
HE GOT INTO DEBT AND INTO
JAIL HIS MOTHER HELPED HIM OUT TWICE BUT AS SOON AS HE WAS FREE HE
RETURNED TO HIS OLD COMPANIONS AND HABITS
HIS HEAD WAS NOT STRONG THE
KNAVES HE LIVED AMONGST FOOLED HIM BEYOND ANYTHING I EVER HEARD
HE CAME
DOWN TO GATESHEAD ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO AND WANTED MISSIS TO GIVE UP ALL
TO HIM
MISSIS REFUSED HER MEANS HAVE LONG BEEN MUCH REDUCED BY HIS
EXTRAVAGANCE SO HE WENT BACK AGAIN AND THE NEXT NEWS WAS THAT HE WAS
DEAD
HOW HE DIED GOD KNOWS THEY SAY HE KILLED HIMSELF
I WAS SILENT THE THINGS WERE FRIGHTFUL
ROBERT LEAVEN RESUMED
MISSIS HAD BEEN OUT OF HEALTH HERSELF FOR SOME TIME SHE HAD GOT VERY
STOUT BUT WAS NOT STRONG WITH IT AND THE LOSS OF MONEY AND FEAR OF
POVERTY WERE QUITE BREAKING HER DOWN
THE INFORMATION ABOUT MR
JOHN'S
DEATH AND THE MANNER OF IT CAME TOO SUDDENLY IT BROUGHT ON A STROKE
SHE
WAS THREE DAYS WITHOUT SPEAKING BUT LAST TUESDAY SHE SEEMED RATHER
BETTER SHE APPEARED AS IF SHE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING AND KEPT MAKING
SIGNS TO MY WIFE AND MUMBLING
IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY MORNING HOWEVER
THAT BESSIE UNDERSTOOD SHE WAS PRONOUNCING YOUR NAME AND AT LAST SHE
MADE OUT THE WORDS 'BRING JANE FETCH JANE EYRE I WANT TO SPEAK TO
HER BESSIE IS NOT SURE WHETHER SHE IS IN HER RIGHT MIND OR MEANS
ANYTHING BY THE WORDS BUT SHE TOLD MISS REED AND MISS GEORGIANA AND
ADVISED THEM TO SEND FOR YOU
THE YOUNG LADIES PUT IT OFF AT FIRST BUT
THEIR MOTHER GREW SO RESTLESS AND SAID 'JANE JANE SO MANY TIMES
THAT AT LAST THEY CONSENTED
I LEFT GATESHEAD YESTERDAY AND IF YOU CAN
GET READY MISS I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU BACK WITH ME EARLY TO MORROW
MORNING
YES ROBERT I SHALL BE READY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I OUGHT TO GO
I THINK SO TOO MISS
BESSIE SAID SHE WAS SURE YOU WOULD NOT REFUSE
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK LEAVE BEFORE YOU CAN GET OFF
YES AND I WILL DO IT NOW AND HAVING DIRECTED HIM TO THE SERVANTS'
HALL AND RECOMMENDED HIM TO THE CARE OF JOHN'S WIFE AND THE ATTENTIONS
OF JOHN HIMSELF I WENT IN SEARCH OF MR
ROCHESTER
HE WAS NOT IN ANY OF THE LOWER ROOMS HE WAS NOT IN THE YARD THE
STABLES OR THE GROUNDS
I ASKED MRS
FAIRFAX IF SHE HAD SEEN HIM YES
SHE BELIEVED HE WAS PLAYING BILLIARDS WITH MISS INGRAM
TO THE BILLIARD
ROOM I HASTENED THE CLICK OF BALLS AND THE HUM OF VOICES RESOUNDED
THENCE MR
ROCHESTER MISS INGRAM THE TWO MISSES ESHTON AND THEIR
ADMIRERS WERE ALL BUSIED IN THE GAME
IT REQUIRED SOME COURAGE TO
DISTURB SO INTERESTING A PARTY MY ERRAND HOWEVER WAS ONE I COULD NOT
DEFER SO I APPROACHED THE MASTER WHERE HE STOOD AT MISS INGRAM'S SIDE
SHE TURNED AS I DREW NEAR AND LOOKED AT ME HAUGHTILY HER EYES SEEMED TO
DEMAND WHAT CAN THE CREEPING CREATURE WANT NOW AND WHEN I SAID IN A
LOW VOICE MR
ROCHESTER SHE MADE A MOVEMENT AS IF TEMPTED TO ORDER ME
AWAY
I REMEMBER HER APPEARANCE AT THE MOMENT IT WAS VERY GRACEFUL AND
VERY STRIKING SHE WORE A MORNING ROBE OF SKY BLUE CRAPE A GAUZY AZURE
SCARF WAS TWISTED IN HER HAIR
SHE HAD BEEN ALL ANIMATION WITH THE GAME
AND IRRITATED PRIDE DID NOT LOWER THE EXPRESSION OF HER HAUGHTY
LINEAMENTS
DOES THAT PERSON WANT YOU SHE INQUIRED OF MR
ROCHESTER AND MR
ROCHESTER TURNED TO SEE WHO THE PERSON WAS
HE MADE A CURIOUS
GRIMACE ONE OF HIS STRANGE AND EQUIVOCAL DEMONSTRATIONS THREW DOWN HIS
CUE AND FOLLOWED ME FROM THE ROOM

WHICH HE HAD SHUT

RUNNING A HUNDRED MILES TO SEE AN OLD LADY WHO WILL PERHAPS BE DEAD

ADELE AS YOU SAY MUST GO TO SCHOOL AND YOU OF COURSE MUST MARCH
STRAIGHT TO THE DEVIL

YOU TO SEEK A PLACE I SUPPOSE

YES
IT SEEMS STINGY TO MY NOTIONS AND DRY AND UNFRIENDLY
I SHOULD LIKE
SOMETHING ELSE A LITTLE ADDITION TO THE RITE
IF ONE SHOOK HANDS FOR
INSTANCE BUT NO THAT WOULD NOT CONTENT ME EITHER
SO YOU'LL DO NO MORE
THAN SAY FAREWELL JANE
IT IS ENOUGH SIR AS MUCH GOOD WILL MAY BE CONVEYED IN ONE HEARTY WORD
AS IN MANY
VERY LIKELY BUT IT IS BLANK AND COOL 'FAREWELL
HOW LONG IS HE GOING TO STAND WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THAT DOOR I ASKED
MYSELF I WANT TO COMMENCE MY PACKING THE DINNER BELL RANG AND
SUDDENLY AWAY HE BOLTED WITHOUT ANOTHER SYLLABLE I SAW HIM NO MORE
DURING THE DAY AND WAS OFF BEFORE HE HAD RISEN IN THE MORNING
I REACHED THE LODGE AT GATESHEAD ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON OF
THE FIRST OF MAY I STEPPED IN THERE BEFORE GOING UP TO THE HALL
IT WAS
VERY CLEAN AND NEAT THE ORNAMENTAL WINDOWS WERE HUNG WITH LITTLE WHITE
CURTAINS THE FLOOR WAS SPOTLESS THE GRATE AND FIRE IRONS WERE BURNISHED
BRIGHT AND THE FIRE BURNT CLEAR
BESSIE SAT ON THE HEARTH NURSING HER
LAST BORN AND ROBERT AND HIS SISTER PLAYED QUIETLY IN A CORNER
BLESS YOU I KNEW YOU WOULD COME EXCLAIMED MRS
LEAVEN AS I ENTERED
YES BESSIE SAID I AFTER I HAD KISSED HER AND I TRUST I AM NOT TOO
LATE
HOW IS MRS
REED ALIVE STILL I HOPE
YES SHE IS ALIVE AND MORE SENSIBLE AND COLLECTED THAN SHE WAS
THE
DOCTOR SAYS SHE MAY LINGER A WEEK OR TWO YET BUT HE HARDLY THINKS SHE
WILL FINALLY RECOVER
HAS SHE MENTIONED ME LATELY
SHE WAS TALKING OF YOU ONLY THIS MORNING AND WISHING YOU WOULD COME
BUT SHE IS SLEEPING NOW OR WAS TEN MINUTES AGO WHEN I WAS UP AT THE
HOUSE
SHE GENERALLY LIES IN A KIND OF LETHARGY ALL THE AFTERNOON AND
WAKES UP ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN
WILL YOU REST YOURSELF HERE AN HOUR MISS
AND THEN I WILL GO UP WITH YOU
ROBERT HERE ENTERED AND BESSIE LAID HER SLEEPING CHILD IN THE CRADLE AND
WENT TO WELCOME HIM AFTERWARDS SHE INSISTED ON MY TAKING OFF MY BONNET
AND HAVING SOME TEA FOR SHE SAID I LOOKED PALE AND TIRED
I WAS GLAD TO
ACCEPT HER HOSPITALITY AND I SUBMITTED TO BE RELIEVED OF MY TRAVELLING
GARB JUST AS PASSIVELY AS I USED TO LET HER UNDRESS ME WHEN A CHILD
OLD TIMES CROWDED FAST BACK ON ME AS I WATCHED HER BUSTLING ABOUT SETTING
OUT THE TEA TRAY WITH HER BEST CHINA CUTTING BREAD AND BUTTER TOASTING
A TEA CAKE AND BETWEEN WHILES GIVING LITTLE ROBERT OR JANE AN
OCCASIONAL TAP OR PUSH JUST AS SHE USED TO GIVE ME IN FORMER DAYS
BESSIE HAD RETAINED HER QUICK TEMPER AS WELL AS HER LIGHT FOOT AND GOOD
LOOKS
TEA READY I WAS GOING TO APPROACH THE TABLE BUT SHE DESIRED ME TO SIT
STILL QUITE IN HER OLD PEREMPTORY TONES
I MUST BE SERVED AT THE
FIRESIDE SHE SAID AND SHE PLACED BEFORE ME A LITTLE ROUND STAND WITH MY
CUP AND A PLATE OF TOAST ABSOLUTELY AS SHE USED TO ACCOMMODATE ME WITH
SOME PRIVATELY PURLOINED DAINTY ON A NURSERY CHAIR AND I SMILED AND
OBEYED HER AS IN BYGONE DAYS
SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF I WAS HAPPY AT THORNFIELD HALL AND WHAT SORT OF A
PERSON THE MISTRESS WAS AND WHEN I TOLD HER THERE WAS ONLY A MASTER
WHETHER HE WAS A NICE GENTLEMAN AND IF I LIKED HIM
I TOLD HER HE WAS
RATHER AN UGLY MAN BUT QUITE A GENTLEMAN AND THAT HE TREATED ME KINDLY
AND I WAS CONTENT
THEN I WENT ON TO DESCRIBE TO HER THE GAY COMPANY
THAT HAD LATELY BEEN STAYING AT THE HOUSE AND TO THESE DETAILS BESSIE
LISTENED WITH INTEREST THEY WERE PRECISELY OF THE KIND SHE RELISHED
IN SUCH CONVERSATION AN HOUR WAS SOON GONE BESSIE RESTORED TO ME MY
BONNET C AND ACCOMPANIED BY HER I QUITTED THE LODGE FOR THE HALL
IT WAS ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY HER THAT I HAD NEARLY NINE YEARS AGO WALKED
DOWN THE PATH I WAS NOW ASCENDING
ON A DARK MISTY RAW MORNING IN
JANUARY I HAD LEFT A HOSTILE ROOF WITH A DESPERATE AND EMBITTERED
HEART A SENSE OF OUTLAWRY AND ALMOST OF REPROBATION TO SEEK THE CHILLY
HARBOURAGE OF LOWOOD THAT BOURNE SO FAR AWAY AND UNEXPLORED
THE SAME
HOSTILE ROOF NOW AGAIN ROSE BEFORE ME MY PROSPECTS WERE DOUBTFUL YET
AND I HAD YET AN ACHING HEART
I STILL FELT AS A WANDERER ON THE FACE OF
THE EARTH BUT I EXPERIENCED FIRMER TRUST IN MYSELF AND MY OWN POWERS
AND LESS WITHERING DREAD OF OPPRESSION
THE GAPING WOUND OF MY WRONGS
TOO WAS NOW QUITE HEALED AND THE FLAME OF RESENTMENT EXTINGUISHED
YOU SHALL GO INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM FIRST SAID BESSIE AS SHE
PRECEDED ME THROUGH THE HALL THE YOUNG LADIES WILL BE THERE
IN ANOTHER MOMENT I WAS WITHIN THAT APARTMENT
THERE WAS EVERY ARTICLE
OF FURNITURE LOOKING JUST AS IT DID ON THE MORNING I WAS FIRST INTRODUCED
TO MR
BROCKLEHURST THE VERY RUG HE HAD STOOD UPON STILL COVERED THE
HEARTH
GLANCING AT THE BOOKCASES I THOUGHT I COULD DISTINGUISH THE TWO
VOLUMES OF BEWICK'S BRITISH BIRDS OCCUPYING THEIR OLD PLACE ON THE THIRD
SHELF AND GULLIVER'S TRAVELS AND THE ARABIAN NIGHTS RANGED JUST ABOVE
THE INANIMATE OBJECTS WERE NOT CHANGED BUT THE LIVING THINGS HAD ALTERED
PAST RECOGNITION
TWO YOUNG LADIES APPEARED BEFORE ME ONE VERY TALL ALMOST AS TALL AS
MISS INGRAM VERY THIN TOO WITH A SALLOW FACE AND SEVERE MIEN
THERE
WAS SOMETHING ASCETIC IN HER LOOK WHICH WAS AUGMENTED BY THE EXTREME
PLAINNESS OF A STRAIGHT SKIRTED BLACK STUFF DRESS A STARCHED LINEN
COLLAR HAIR COMBED AWAY FROM THE TEMPLES AND THE NUN LIKE ORNAMENT OF A
STRING OF EBONY BEADS AND A CRUCIFIX
THIS I FELT SURE WAS ELIZA THOUGH
I COULD TRACE LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO HER FORMER SELF IN THAT ELONGATED AND
COLOURLESS VISAGE
THE OTHER WAS AS CERTAINLY GEORGIANA BUT NOT THE GEORGIANA I
REMEMBERED THE SLIM AND FAIRY LIKE GIRL OF ELEVEN
THIS WAS A
FULL BLOWN VERY PLUMP DAMSEL FAIR AS WAXWORK WITH HANDSOME AND REGULAR
FEATURES LANGUISHING BLUE EYES AND RINGLETED YELLOW HAIR
THE HUE OF
HER DRESS WAS BLACK TOO BUT ITS FASHION WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM HER
SISTER'S SO MUCH MORE FLOWING AND BECOMING IT LOOKED AS STYLISH AS THE
OTHER'S LOOKED PURITANICAL
IN EACH OF THE SISTERS THERE WAS ONE TRAIT OF THE MOTHER AND ONLY ONE
THE THIN AND PALLID ELDER DAUGHTER HAD HER PARENT'S CAIRNGORM EYE THE
BLOOMING AND LUXURIANT YOUNGER GIRL HAD HER CONTOUR OF JAW AND
CHIN PERHAPS A LITTLE SOFTENED BUT STILL IMPARTING AN INDESCRIBABLE
HARDNESS TO THE COUNTENANCE OTHERWISE SO VOLUPTUOUS AND BUXOM
BOTH LADIES AS I ADVANCED ROSE TO WELCOME ME AND BOTH ADDRESSED ME BY
THE NAME OF MISS EYRE ELIZA'S GREETING WAS DELIVERED IN A SHORT
ABRUPT VOICE WITHOUT A SMILE AND THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN FIXED HER
EYES ON THE FIRE AND SEEMED TO FORGET ME
GEORGIANA ADDED TO HER HOW
D'YE DO SEVERAL COMMONPLACES ABOUT MY JOURNEY THE WEATHER AND SO ON
UTTERED IN RATHER A DRAWLING TONE AND ACCOMPANIED BY SUNDRY SIDE GLANCES
THAT MEASURED ME FROM HEAD TO FOOT NOW TRAVERSING THE FOLDS OF MY DRAB
MERINO PELISSE AND NOW LINGERING ON THE PLAIN TRIMMING OF MY COTTAGE
BONNET
YOUNG LADIES HAVE A REMARKABLE WAY OF LETTING YOU KNOW THAT THEY
THINK YOU A QUIZ WITHOUT ACTUALLY SAYING THE WORDS
A CERTAIN
SUPERCILIOUSNESS OF LOOK COOLNESS OF MANNER NONCHALANCE OF TONE
EXPRESS FULLY THEIR SENTIMENTS ON THE POINT WITHOUT COMMITTING THEM BY
ANY POSITIVE RUDENESS IN WORD OR DEED
A SNEER HOWEVER WHETHER COVERT OR OPEN HAD NOW NO LONGER THAT POWER
OVER ME IT ONCE POSSESSED AS I SAT BETWEEN MY COUSINS I WAS SURPRISED
TO FIND HOW EASY I FELT UNDER THE TOTAL NEGLECT OF THE ONE AND THE SEMI
SARCASTIC ATTENTIONS OF THE OTHER ELIZA DID NOT MORTIFY NOR GEORGIANA
RUFFLE ME
THE FACT WAS I HAD OTHER THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WITHIN THE
LAST FEW MONTHS FEELINGS HAD BEEN STIRRED IN ME SO MUCH MORE POTENT THAN
ANY THEY COULD RAISE PAINS AND PLEASURES SO MUCH MORE ACUTE AND
EXQUISITE HAD BEEN EXCITED THAN ANY IT WAS IN THEIR POWER TO INFLICT OR
BESTOW THAT THEIR AIRS GAVE ME NO CONCERN EITHER FOR GOOD OR BAD
HOW IS MRS
REED I ASKED SOON LOOKING CALMLY AT GEORGIANA WHO
THOUGHT FIT TO BRIDLE AT THE DIRECT ADDRESS AS IF IT WERE AN UNEXPECTED
LIBERTY
MRS
REED AH MAMA YOU MEAN SHE IS EXTREMELY POORLY I DOUBT IF YOU
CAN SEE HER TO NIGHT
IF SAID I YOU WOULD JUST STEP UPSTAIRS AND TELL HER I AM COME I
SHOULD BE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
GEORGIANA ALMOST STARTED AND SHE OPENED HER BLUE EYES WILD AND WIDE
I
KNOW SHE HAD A PARTICULAR WISH TO SEE ME I ADDED AND I WOULD NOT
DEFER ATTENDING TO HER DESIRE LONGER THAN IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
MAMA DISLIKES BEING DISTURBED IN AN EVENING REMARKED ELIZA
I SOON
ROSE QUIETLY TOOK OFF MY BONNET AND GLOVES UNINVITED AND SAID I WOULD
JUST STEP OUT TO BESSIE WHO WAS I DARED SAY IN THE KITCHEN AND ASK
HER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER MRS
REED WAS DISPOSED TO RECEIVE ME OR NOT TO
NIGHT
I WENT AND HAVING FOUND BESSIE AND DESPATCHED HER ON MY ERRAND
I PROCEEDED TO TAKE FURTHER MEASURES
IT HAD HERETOFORE BEEN MY HABIT
ALWAYS TO SHRINK FROM ARROGANCE RECEIVED AS I HAD BEEN TO DAY I SHOULD
A YEAR AGO HAVE RESOLVED TO QUIT GATESHEAD THE VERY NEXT MORNING NOW
IT WAS DISCLOSED TO ME ALL AT ONCE THAT THAT WOULD BE A FOOLISH PLAN
I
HAD TAKEN A JOURNEY OF A HUNDRED MILES TO SEE MY AUNT AND I MUST STAY
WITH HER TILL SHE WAS BETTER OR DEAD AS TO HER DAUGHTERS' PRIDE OR
FOLLY I MUST PUT IT ON ONE SIDE MAKE MYSELF INDEPENDENT OF IT
SO I
ADDRESSED THE HOUSEKEEPER ASKED HER TO SHOW ME A ROOM TOLD HER I SHOULD
PROBABLY BE A VISITOR HERE FOR A WEEK OR TWO HAD MY TRUNK CONVEYED TO MY
CHAMBER AND FOLLOWED IT THITHER MYSELF I MET BESSIE ON THE LANDING
MISSIS IS AWAKE SAID SHE I HAVE TOLD HER YOU ARE HERE COME AND LET
US SEE IF SHE WILL KNOW YOU
I DID NOT NEED TO BE GUIDED TO THE WELL KNOWN ROOM TO WHICH I HAD SO
OFTEN BEEN SUMMONED FOR CHASTISEMENT OR REPRIMAND IN FORMER DAYS
I
HASTENED BEFORE BESSIE I SOFTLY OPENED THE DOOR A SHADED LIGHT STOOD ON
THE TABLE FOR IT WAS NOW GETTING DARK
THERE WAS THE GREAT FOUR POST
BED WITH AMBER HANGINGS AS OF OLD THERE THE TOILET TABLE THE ARMCHAIR
AND THE FOOTSTOOL AT WHICH I HAD A HUNDRED TIMES BEEN SENTENCED TO
KNEEL TO ASK PARDON FOR OFFENCES BY ME UNCOMMITTED
I LOOKED INTO A
CERTAIN CORNER NEAR HALF EXPECTING TO SEE THE SLIM OUTLINE OF A ONCE
DREADED SWITCH WHICH USED TO LURK THERE WAITING TO LEAP OUT IMP LIKE AND
LACE MY QUIVERING PALM OR SHRINKING NECK
I APPROACHED THE BED I OPENED
THE CURTAINS AND LEANT OVER THE HIGH PILED PILLOWS
WELL DID I REMEMBER MRS
REED'S FACE AND I EAGERLY SOUGHT THE FAMILIAR
IMAGE
IT IS A HAPPY THING THAT TIME QUELLS THE LONGINGS OF VENGEANCE
AND HUSHES THE PROMPTINGS OF RAGE AND AVERSION
I HAD LEFT THIS WOMAN IN
BITTERNESS AND HATE AND I CAME BACK TO HER NOW WITH NO OTHER EMOTION
THAN A SORT OF RUTH FOR HER GREAT SUFFERINGS AND A STRONG YEARNING TO
FORGET AND FORGIVE ALL INJURIES TO BE RECONCILED AND CLASP HANDS IN
AMITY
THE WELL KNOWN FACE WAS THERE STERN RELENTLESS AS EVER THERE WAS THAT
PECULIAR EYE WHICH NOTHING COULD MELT AND THE SOMEWHAT RAISED
IMPERIOUS DESPOTIC EYEBROW
HOW OFTEN HAD IT LOWERED ON ME MENACE AND
HATE AND HOW THE RECOLLECTION OF CHILDHOOD'S TERRORS AND SORROWS REVIVED
AS I TRACED ITS HARSH LINE NOW AND YET I STOOPED DOWN AND KISSED HER
SHE LOOKED AT ME
IS THIS JANE EYRE SHE SAID
YES AUNT REED
HOW ARE YOU DEAR AUNT
I HAD ONCE VOWED THAT I WOULD NEVER CALL HER AUNT AGAIN I THOUGHT IT NO
SIN TO FORGET AND BREAK THAT VOW NOW
MY FINGERS HAD FASTENED ON HER
HAND WHICH LAY OUTSIDE THE SHEET HAD SHE PRESSED MINE KINDLY I SHOULD
AT THAT MOMENT HAVE EXPERIENCED TRUE PLEASURE
BUT UNIMPRESSIONABLE
NATURES ARE NOT SO SOON SOFTENED NOR ARE NATURAL ANTIPATHIES SO READILY
ERADICATED
MRS
REED TOOK HER HAND AWAY AND TURNING HER FACE RATHER
FROM ME SHE REMARKED THAT THE NIGHT WAS WARM
AGAIN SHE REGARDED ME SO
ICILY I FELT AT ONCE THAT HER OPINION OF ME HER FEELING TOWARDS ME WAS
UNCHANGED AND UNCHANGEABLE
I KNEW BY HER STONY EYE OPAQUE TO
TENDERNESS INDISSOLUBLE TO TEARS THAT SHE WAS RESOLVED TO CONSIDER ME
BAD TO THE LAST BECAUSE TO BELIEVE ME GOOD WOULD GIVE HER NO GENEROUS
PLEASURE ONLY A SENSE OF MORTIFICATION
I FELT PAIN AND THEN I FELT IRE AND THEN I FELT A DETERMINATION TO
SUBDUE HER TO BE HER MISTRESS IN SPITE BOTH OF HER NATURE AND HER WILL
MY TEARS HAD RISEN JUST AS IN CHILDHOOD I ORDERED THEM BACK TO THEIR
SOURCE
I BROUGHT A CHAIR TO THE BED HEAD I SAT DOWN AND LEANED OVER
THE PILLOW
YOU SENT FOR ME I SAID AND I AM HERE AND IT IS MY INTENTION TO STAY
TILL I SEE HOW YOU GET ON
OH OF COURSE YOU HAVE SEEN MY DAUGHTERS
YES
WELL YOU MAY TELL THEM I WISH YOU TO STAY TILL I CAN TALK SOME THINGS
OVER WITH YOU I HAVE ON MY MIND TO NIGHT IT IS TOO LATE AND I HAVE A
DIFFICULTY IN RECALLING THEM
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING I WISHED TO
SAY LET ME SEE
THE WANDERING LOOK AND CHANGED UTTERANCE TOLD WHAT WRECK HAD TAKEN PLACE
IN HER ONCE VIGOROUS FRAME
TURNING RESTLESSLY SHE DREW THE BEDCLOTHES
ROUND HER MY ELBOW RESTING ON A CORNER OF THE QUILT FIXED IT DOWN SHE
WAS AT ONCE IRRITATED
SIT UP SAID SHE DON'T ANNOY ME WITH HOLDING THE CLOTHES FAST
ARE
YOU JANE EYRE
I AM JANE EYRE
I HAVE HAD MORE TROUBLE WITH THAT CHILD THAN ANY ONE WOULD BELIEVE
SUCH
A BURDEN TO BE LEFT ON MY HANDS AND SO MUCH ANNOYANCE AS SHE CAUSED ME
DAILY AND HOURLY WITH HER INCOMPREHENSIBLE DISPOSITION AND HER SUDDEN
STARTS OF TEMPER AND HER CONTINUAL UNNATURAL WATCHINGS OF ONE'S
MOVEMENTS I DECLARE SHE TALKED TO ME ONCE LIKE SOMETHING MAD OR LIKE A
FIEND NO CHILD EVER SPOKE OR LOOKED AS SHE DID I WAS GLAD TO GET HER
AWAY FROM THE HOUSE
WHAT DID THEY DO WITH HER AT LOWOOD THE FEVER
BROKE OUT THERE AND MANY OF THE PUPILS DIED
SHE HOWEVER DID NOT DIE
BUT I SAID SHE DID I WISH SHE HAD DIED
A STRANGE WISH MRS
REED WHY DO YOU HATE HER SO
I HAD A DISLIKE TO HER MOTHER ALWAYS FOR SHE WAS MY HUSBAND'S ONLY
SISTER AND A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH HIM HE OPPOSED THE FAMILY'S DISOWNING
HER WHEN SHE MADE HER LOW MARRIAGE AND WHEN NEWS CAME OF HER DEATH HE
WEPT LIKE A SIMPLETON
HE WOULD SEND FOR THE BABY THOUGH I ENTREATED
HIM RATHER TO PUT IT OUT TO NURSE AND PAY FOR ITS MAINTENANCE
I HATED
IT THE FIRST TIME I SET MY EYES ON IT A SICKLY WHINING PINING THING
IT WOULD WAIL IN ITS CRADLE ALL NIGHT LONG NOT SCREAMING HEARTILY LIKE
ANY OTHER CHILD BUT WHIMPERING AND MOANING
REED PITIED IT AND HE USED
TO NURSE IT AND NOTICE IT AS IF IT HAD BEEN HIS OWN MORE INDEED THAN
HE EVER NOTICED HIS OWN AT THAT AGE
HE WOULD TRY TO MAKE MY CHILDREN
FRIENDLY TO THE LITTLE BEGGAR THE DARLINGS COULD NOT BEAR IT AND HE WAS
ANGRY WITH THEM WHEN THEY SHOWED THEIR DISLIKE
IN HIS LAST ILLNESS HE
HAD IT BROUGHT CONTINUALLY TO HIS BEDSIDE AND BUT AN HOUR BEFORE HE
DIED HE BOUND ME BY VOW TO KEEP THE CREATURE
I WOULD AS SOON HAVE BEEN
CHARGED WITH A PAUPER BRAT OUT OF A WORKHOUSE BUT HE WAS WEAK NATURALLY
WEAK
JOHN DOES NOT AT ALL RESEMBLE HIS FATHER AND I AM GLAD OF IT
JOHN IS LIKE ME AND LIKE MY BROTHERS HE IS QUITE A GIBSON
OH I WISH
HE WOULD CEASE TORMENTING ME WITH LETTERS FOR MONEY I HAVE NO MORE
MONEY TO GIVE HIM WE ARE GETTING POOR
I MUST SEND AWAY HALF THE
SERVANTS AND SHUT UP PART OF THE HOUSE OR LET IT OFF
I CAN NEVER
SUBMIT TO DO THAT YET HOW ARE WE TO GET ON TWO THIRDS OF MY INCOME
GOES IN PAYING THE INTEREST OF MORTGAGES
JOHN GAMBLES DREADFULLY AND
ALWAYS LOSES POOR BOY HE IS BESET BY SHARPERS JOHN IS SUNK AND
DEGRADED HIS LOOK IS FRIGHTFUL I FEEL ASHAMED FOR HIM WHEN I SEE HIM
SHE WAS GETTING MUCH EXCITED
I THINK I HAD BETTER LEAVE HER NOW SAID
I TO BESSIE WHO STOOD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED
PERHAPS YOU HAD MISS BUT SHE OFTEN TALKS IN THIS WAY TOWARDS NIGHT IN
THE MORNING SHE IS CALMER
I ROSE
STOP EXCLAIMED MRS
REED THERE IS ANOTHER THING I WISHED TO
SAY
HE THREATENS ME HE CONTINUALLY THREATENS ME WITH HIS OWN DEATH OR
MINE AND I DREAM SOMETIMES THAT I SEE HIM LAID OUT WITH A GREAT WOUND IN
HIS THROAT OR WITH A SWOLLEN AND BLACKENED FACE
I AM COME TO A STRANGE
PASS I HAVE HEAVY TROUBLES
WHAT IS TO BE DONE HOW IS THE MONEY TO BE
HAD
BESSIE NOW ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HER TO TAKE A SEDATIVE DRAUGHT SHE
SUCCEEDED WITH DIFFICULTY
SOON AFTER MRS
REED GREW MORE COMPOSED AND
SANK INTO A DOZING STATE
I THEN LEFT HER
MORE THAN TEN DAYS ELAPSED BEFORE I HAD AGAIN ANY CONVERSATION WITH HER
SHE CONTINUED EITHER DELIRIOUS OR LETHARGIC AND THE DOCTOR FORBADE
EVERYTHING WHICH COULD PAINFULLY EXCITE HER
MEANTIME I GOT ON AS WELL
AS I COULD WITH GEORGIANA AND ELIZA
THEY WERE VERY COLD INDEED AT
FIRST
ELIZA WOULD SIT HALF THE DAY SEWING READING OR WRITING AND
SCARCELY UTTER A WORD EITHER TO ME OR HER SISTER
GEORGIANA WOULD
CHATTER NONSENSE TO HER CANARY BIRD BY THE HOUR AND TAKE NO NOTICE OF
ME
BUT I WAS DETERMINED NOT TO SEEM AT A LOSS FOR OCCUPATION OR
AMUSEMENT I HAD BROUGHT MY DRAWING MATERIALS WITH ME AND THEY SERVED ME
FOR BOTH
PROVIDED WITH A CASE OF PENCILS AND SOME SHEETS OF PAPER I USED TO TAKE
A SEAT APART FROM THEM NEAR THE WINDOW AND BUSY MYSELF IN SKETCHING
FANCY VIGNETTES REPRESENTING ANY SCENE THAT HAPPENED MOMENTARILY TO
SHAPE ITSELF IN THE EVER SHIFTING KALEIDOSCOPE OF IMAGINATION A GLIMPSE
OF SEA BETWEEN TWO ROCKS THE RISING MOON AND A SHIP CROSSING ITS DISK
A GROUP OF REEDS AND WATER FLAGS AND A NAIAD'S HEAD CROWNED WITH LOTUS
FLOWERS RISING OUT OF THEM AN ELF SITTING IN A HEDGE SPARROW'S NEST
UNDER A WREATH OF HAWTHORN BLOOM
ONE MORNING I FELL TO SKETCHING A FACE WHAT SORT OF A FACE IT WAS TO BE
I DID NOT CARE OR KNOW
I TOOK A SOFT BLACK PENCIL GAVE IT A BROAD
POINT AND WORKED AWAY
SOON I HAD TRACED ON THE PAPER A BROAD AND
PROMINENT FOREHEAD AND A SQUARE LOWER OUTLINE OF VISAGE THAT CONTOUR
GAVE ME PLEASURE MY FINGERS PROCEEDED ACTIVELY TO FILL IT WITH FEATURES
STRONGLY MARKED HORIZONTAL EYEBROWS MUST BE TRACED UNDER THAT BROW THEN
FOLLOWED NATURALLY A WELL DEFINED NOSE WITH A STRAIGHT RIDGE AND FULL
NOSTRILS THEN A FLEXIBLE LOOKING MOUTH BY NO MEANS NARROW THEN A FIRM
CHIN WITH A DECIDED CLEFT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF IT OF COURSE SOME BLACK
WHISKERS WERE WANTED AND SOME JETTY HAIR TUFTED ON THE TEMPLES AND
WAVED ABOVE THE FOREHEAD
NOW FOR THE EYES I HAD LEFT THEM TO THE LAST
BECAUSE THEY REQUIRED THE MOST CAREFUL WORKING
I DREW THEM LARGE I
SHAPED THEM WELL THE EYELASHES I TRACED LONG AND SOMBRE THE IRIDS
LUSTROUS AND LARGE
GOOD BUT NOT QUITE THE THING I THOUGHT AS I
SURVEYED THE EFFECT THEY WANT MORE FORCE AND SPIRIT AND I WROUGHT THE
SHADES BLACKER THAT THE LIGHTS MIGHT FLASH MORE BRILLIANTLY A HAPPY
TOUCH OR TWO SECURED SUCCESS
THERE I HAD A FRIEND'S FACE UNDER MY
GAZE AND WHAT DID IT SIGNIFY THAT THOSE YOUNG LADIES TURNED THEIR BACKS
ON ME I LOOKED AT IT I SMILED AT THE SPEAKING LIKENESS I WAS ABSORBED
AND CONTENT
IS THAT A PORTRAIT OF SOME ONE YOU KNOW ASKED ELIZA WHO HAD
APPROACHED ME UNNOTICED
I RESPONDED THAT IT WAS MERELY A FANCY HEAD
AND HURRIED IT BENEATH THE OTHER SHEETS
OF COURSE I LIED IT WAS IN
FACT A VERY FAITHFUL REPRESENTATION OF MR
ROCHESTER
BUT WHAT WAS THAT
TO HER OR TO ANY ONE BUT MYSELF GEORGIANA ALSO ADVANCED TO LOOK
THE
OTHER DRAWINGS PLEASED HER MUCH BUT SHE CALLED THAT AN UGLY MAN THEY
BOTH SEEMED SURPRISED AT MY SKILL
I OFFERED TO SKETCH THEIR PORTRAITS
AND EACH IN TURN SAT FOR A PENCIL OUTLINE
THEN GEORGIANA PRODUCED HER
ALBUM
I PROMISED TO CONTRIBUTE A WATER COLOUR DRAWING THIS PUT HER AT
ONCE INTO GOOD HUMOUR
SHE PROPOSED A WALK IN THE GROUNDS
BEFORE WE
HAD BEEN OUT TWO HOURS WE WERE DEEP IN A CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION SHE
HAD FAVOURED ME WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE BRILLIANT WINTER SHE HAD SPENT
IN LONDON TWO SEASONS AGO OF THE ADMIRATION SHE HAD THERE EXCITED THE
ATTENTION SHE HAD RECEIVED AND I EVEN GOT HINTS OF THE TITLED CONQUEST
SHE HAD MADE
IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING THESE HINTS
WERE ENLARGED ON VARIOUS SOFT CONVERSATIONS WERE REPORTED AND
SENTIMENTAL SCENES REPRESENTED AND IN SHORT A VOLUME OF A NOVEL OF
FASHIONABLE LIFE WAS THAT DAY IMPROVISED BY HER FOR MY BENEFIT
THE
COMMUNICATIONS WERE RENEWED FROM DAY TO DAY THEY ALWAYS RAN ON THE SAME
THEME HERSELF HER LOVES AND WOES
IT WAS STRANGE SHE NEVER ONCE
ADVERTED EITHER TO HER MOTHER'S ILLNESS OR HER BROTHER'S DEATH OR THE
PRESENT GLOOMY STATE OF THE FAMILY PROSPECTS
HER MIND SEEMED WHOLLY
TAKEN UP WITH REMINISCENCES OF PAST GAIETY AND ASPIRATIONS AFTER
DISSIPATIONS TO COME
SHE PASSED ABOUT FIVE MINUTES EACH DAY IN HER
MOTHER'S SICK ROOM AND NO MORE
ELIZA STILL SPOKE LITTLE SHE HAD EVIDENTLY NO TIME TO TALK
I NEVER SAW
A BUSIER PERSON THAN SHE SEEMED TO BE YET IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT
SHE DID OR RATHER TO DISCOVER ANY RESULT OF HER DILIGENCE
SHE HAD AN
ALARM TO CALL HER UP EARLY
I KNOW NOT HOW SHE OCCUPIED HERSELF BEFORE
BREAKFAST BUT AFTER THAT MEAL SHE DIVIDED HER TIME INTO REGULAR
PORTIONS AND EACH HOUR HAD ITS ALLOTTED TASK
THREE TIMES A DAY SHE
STUDIED A LITTLE BOOK WHICH I FOUND ON INSPECTION WAS A COMMON PRAYER
BOOK
I ASKED HER ONCE WHAT WAS THE GREAT ATTRACTION OF THAT VOLUME AND
SHE SAID THE RUBRIC THREE HOURS SHE GAVE TO STITCHING WITH GOLD
THREAD THE BORDER OF A SQUARE CRIMSON CLOTH ALMOST LARGE ENOUGH FOR A
CARPET
IN ANSWER TO MY INQUIRIES AFTER THE USE OF THIS ARTICLE SHE
INFORMED ME IT WAS A COVERING FOR THE ALTAR OF A NEW CHURCH LATELY
ERECTED NEAR GATESHEAD
TWO HOURS SHE DEVOTED TO HER DIARY TWO TO
WORKING BY HERSELF IN THE KITCHEN GARDEN AND ONE TO THE REGULATION OF
HER ACCOUNTS
SHE SEEMED TO WANT NO COMPANY NO CONVERSATION
I BELIEVE
SHE WAS HAPPY IN HER WAY THIS ROUTINE SUFFICED FOR HER AND NOTHING
ANNOYED HER SO MUCH AS THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY INCIDENT WHICH FORCED HER TO
VARY ITS CLOCKWORK REGULARITY
SHE TOLD ME ONE EVENING WHEN MORE DISPOSED TO BE COMMUNICATIVE THAN
USUAL THAT JOHN'S CONDUCT AND THE THREATENED RUIN OF THE FAMILY HAD
BEEN A SOURCE OF PROFOUND AFFLICTION TO HER BUT SHE HAD NOW SHE SAID
SETTLED HER MIND AND FORMED HER RESOLUTION
HER OWN FORTUNE SHE HAD
TAKEN CARE TO SECURE AND WHEN HER MOTHER DIED AND IT WAS WHOLLY
IMPROBABLE SHE TRANQUILLY REMARKED THAT SHE SHOULD EITHER RECOVER OR
LINGER LONG SHE WOULD EXECUTE A LONG CHERISHED PROJECT SEEK A
RETIREMENT WHERE PUNCTUAL HABITS WOULD BE PERMANENTLY SECURED FROM
DISTURBANCE AND PLACE SAFE BARRIERS BETWEEN HERSELF AND A FRIVOLOUS
WORLD
I ASKED IF GEORGIANA WOULD ACCOMPANY HER
OF COURSE NOT
GEORGIANA AND SHE HAD NOTHING IN COMMON THEY NEVER HAD
HAD
SHE WOULD NOT BE BURDENED WITH HER SOCIETY FOR ANY CONSIDERATION
GEORGIANA SHOULD TAKE HER OWN COURSE AND SHE ELIZA WOULD TAKE HERS
GEORGIANA WHEN NOT UNBURDENING HER HEART TO ME SPENT MOST OF HER TIME
IN LYING ON THE SOFA FRETTING ABOUT THE DULNESS OF THE HOUSE AND
WISHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT HER AUNT GIBSON WOULD SEND HER AN
INVITATION UP TO TOWN
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER SHE SAID IF SHE
COULD ONLY GET OUT OF THE WAY FOR A MONTH OR TWO TILL ALL WAS OVER I
DID NOT ASK WHAT SHE MEANT BY ALL BEING OVER BUT I SUPPOSE SHE
REFERRED TO THE EXPECTED DECEASE OF HER MOTHER AND THE GLOOMY SEQUEL OF
FUNERAL RITES
ELIZA GENERALLY TOOK NO MORE NOTICE OF HER SISTER'S
INDOLENCE AND COMPLAINTS THAN IF NO SUCH MURMURING LOUNGING OBJECT HAD
BEEN BEFORE HER
ONE DAY HOWEVER AS SHE PUT AWAY HER ACCOUNT BOOK AND
UNFOLDED HER EMBROIDERY SHE SUDDENLY TOOK HER UP THUS
GEORGIANA A MORE VAIN AND ABSURD ANIMAL THAN YOU WAS CERTAINLY NEVER
ALLOWED TO CUMBER THE EARTH
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO BE BORN FOR YOU MAKE
NO USE OF LIFE
INSTEAD OF LIVING FOR IN AND WITH YOURSELF AS A
REASONABLE BEING OUGHT YOU SEEK ONLY TO FASTEN YOUR FEEBLENESS ON SOME
OTHER PERSON'S STRENGTH IF NO ONE CAN BE FOUND WILLING TO BURDEN HER OR
HIMSELF WITH SUCH A FAT WEAK PUFFY USELESS THING YOU CRY OUT THAT YOU
ARE ILL TREATED NEGLECTED MISERABLE
THEN TOO EXISTENCE FOR YOU MUST
BE A SCENE OF CONTINUAL CHANGE AND EXCITEMENT OR ELSE THE WORLD IS A
DUNGEON YOU MUST BE ADMIRED YOU MUST BE COURTED YOU MUST BE
FLATTERED YOU MUST HAVE MUSIC DANCING AND SOCIETY OR YOU LANGUISH
YOU DIE AWAY
HAVE YOU NO SENSE TO DEVISE A SYSTEM WHICH WILL MAKE YOU
INDEPENDENT OF ALL EFFORTS AND ALL WILLS BUT YOUR OWN TAKE ONE DAY
SHARE IT INTO SECTIONS TO EACH SECTION APPORTION ITS TASK LEAVE NO
STRAY UNEMPLOYED QUARTERS OF AN HOUR TEN MINUTES FIVE MINUTES INCLUDE
ALL DO EACH PIECE OF BUSINESS IN ITS TURN WITH METHOD WITH RIGID
REGULARITY
THE DAY WILL CLOSE ALMOST BEFORE YOU ARE AWARE IT HAS BEGUN
AND YOU ARE INDEBTED TO NO ONE FOR HELPING YOU TO GET RID OF ONE VACANT
MOMENT YOU HAVE HAD TO SEEK NO ONE'S COMPANY CONVERSATION SYMPATHY
FORBEARANCE YOU HAVE LIVED IN SHORT AS AN INDEPENDENT BEING OUGHT TO
DO
TAKE THIS ADVICE THE FIRST AND LAST I SHALL OFFER YOU THEN YOU
WILL NOT WANT ME OR ANY ONE ELSE HAPPEN WHAT MAY
NEGLECT IT GO ON AS
HERETOFORE CRAVING WHINING AND IDLING AND SUFFER THE RESULTS OF YOUR
IDIOCY HOWEVER BAD AND INSUPERABLE THEY MAY BE
I TELL YOU THIS
PLAINLY AND LISTEN FOR THOUGH I SHALL NO MORE REPEAT WHAT I AM NOW
ABOUT TO SAY I SHALL STEADILY ACT ON IT
AFTER MY MOTHER'S DEATH I
WASH MY HANDS OF YOU FROM THE DAY HER COFFIN IS CARRIED TO THE VAULT IN
GATESHEAD CHURCH YOU AND I WILL BE AS SEPARATE AS IF WE HAD NEVER KNOWN
EACH OTHER
YOU NEED NOT THINK THAT BECAUSE WE CHANCED TO BE BORN OF THE
SAME PARENTS I SHALL SUFFER YOU TO FASTEN ME DOWN BY EVEN THE FEEBLEST
CLAIM I CAN TELL YOU THIS IF THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE OURSELVES EXCEPTED
WERE SWEPT AWAY AND WE TWO STOOD ALONE ON THE EARTH I WOULD LEAVE YOU
IN THE OLD WORLD AND BETAKE MYSELF TO THE NEW
SHE CLOSED HER LIPS
YOU MIGHT HAVE SPARED YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF DELIVERING THAT TIRADE
ANSWERED GEORGIANA
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU ARE THE MOST SELFISH HEARTLESS
CREATURE IN EXISTENCE AND I KNOW YOUR SPITEFUL HATRED TOWARDS ME I
HAVE HAD A SPECIMEN OF IT BEFORE IN THE TRICK YOU PLAYED ME ABOUT LORD
EDWIN VERE YOU COULD NOT BEAR ME TO BE RAISED ABOVE YOU TO HAVE A
TITLE TO BE RECEIVED INTO CIRCLES WHERE YOU DARE NOT SHOW YOUR FACE AND
SO YOU ACTED THE SPY AND INFORMER AND RUINED MY PROSPECTS FOR EVER
GEORGIANA TOOK OUT HER HANDKERCHIEF AND BLEW HER NOSE FOR AN HOUR
AFTERWARDS ELIZA SAT COLD IMPASSABLE AND ASSIDUOUSLY INDUSTRIOUS
TRUE GENEROUS FEELING IS MADE SMALL ACCOUNT OF BY SOME BUT HERE WERE
TWO NATURES RENDERED THE ONE INTOLERABLY ACRID THE OTHER DESPICABLY
SAVOURLESS FOR THE WANT OF IT
FEELING WITHOUT JUDGMENT IS A WASHY
DRAUGHT INDEED BUT JUDGMENT UNTEMPERED BY FEELING IS TOO BITTER AND
HUSKY A MORSEL FOR HUMAN DEGLUTITION
IT WAS A WET AND WINDY AFTERNOON GEORGIANA HAD FALLEN ASLEEP ON THE SOFA
OVER THE PERUSAL OF A NOVEL ELIZA WAS GONE TO ATTEND A SAINT'S DAY
SERVICE AT THE NEW CHURCH FOR IN MATTERS OF RELIGION SHE WAS A RIGID
FORMALIST NO WEATHER EVER PREVENTED THE PUNCTUAL DISCHARGE OF WHAT SHE
CONSIDERED HER DEVOTIONAL DUTIES FAIR OR FOUL SHE WENT TO CHURCH THRICE
EVERY SUNDAY AND AS OFTEN ON WEEK DAYS AS THERE WERE PRAYERS
I BETHOUGHT MYSELF TO GO UPSTAIRS AND SEE HOW THE DYING WOMAN SPED WHO
LAY THERE ALMOST UNHEEDED THE VERY SERVANTS PAID HER BUT A REMITTENT
ATTENTION THE HIRED NURSE BEING LITTLE LOOKED AFTER WOULD SLIP OUT OF
THE ROOM WHENEVER SHE COULD
BESSIE WAS FAITHFUL BUT SHE HAD HER OWN
FAMILY TO MIND AND COULD ONLY COME OCCASIONALLY TO THE HALL
I FOUND
THE SICK ROOM UNWATCHED AS I HAD EXPECTED NO NURSE WAS THERE THE
PATIENT LAY STILL AND SEEMINGLY LETHARGIC HER LIVID FACE SUNK IN THE
PILLOWS THE FIRE WAS DYING IN THE GRATE
I RENEWED THE FUEL
RE ARRANGED THE BEDCLOTHES GAZED AWHILE ON HER WHO COULD NOT NOW GAZE ON
ME AND THEN I MOVED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
THE RAIN BEAT STRONGLY AGAINST THE PANES THE WIND BLEW TEMPESTUOUSLY
ONE LIES THERE I THOUGHT WHO WILL SOON BE BEYOND THE WAR OF EARTHLY
ELEMENTS
WHITHER WILL THAT SPIRIT NOW STRUGGLING TO QUIT ITS MATERIAL
TENEMENT FLIT WHEN AT LENGTH RELEASED
IN PONDERING THE GREAT MYSTERY I THOUGHT OF HELEN BURNS RECALLED HER
DYING WORDS HER FAITH HER DOCTRINE OF THE EQUALITY OF DISEMBODIED
SOULS
I WAS STILL LISTENING IN THOUGHT TO HER WELL REMEMBERED
TONES STILL PICTURING HER PALE AND SPIRITUAL ASPECT HER WASTED FACE AND
SUBLIME GAZE AS SHE LAY ON HER PLACID DEATHBED AND WHISPERED HER
LONGING TO BE RESTORED TO HER DIVINE FATHER'S BOSOM WHEN A FEEBLE VOICE
MURMURED FROM THE COUCH BEHIND WHO IS THAT
I KNEW MRS
REED HAD NOT SPOKEN FOR DAYS WAS SHE REVIVING I WENT UP TO
HER
IT IS I AUNT REED
WHO I WAS HER ANSWER
WHO ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME WITH SURPRISE AND
A SORT OF ALARM BUT STILL NOT WILDLY
YOU ARE QUITE A STRANGER TO
ME WHERE IS BESSIE
SHE IS AT THE LODGE AUNT
AUNT SHE REPEATED
WHO CALLS ME AUNT YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THE
GIBSONS AND YET I KNOW YOU THAT FACE AND THE EYES AND FOREHEAD ARE
QUIET FAMILIAR TO ME YOU ARE LIKE WHY YOU ARE LIKE JANE EYRE
I SAID NOTHING I WAS AFRAID OF OCCASIONING SOME SHOCK BY DECLARING MY
IDENTITY
YET SAID SHE I AM AFRAID IT IS A MISTAKE MY THOUGHTS DECEIVE ME
I
WISHED TO SEE JANE EYRE AND I FANCY A LIKENESS WHERE NONE EXISTS
BESIDES IN EIGHT YEARS SHE MUST BE SO CHANGED I NOW GENTLY ASSURED
HER THAT I WAS THE PERSON SHE SUPPOSED AND DESIRED ME TO BE AND SEEING
THAT I WAS UNDERSTOOD AND THAT HER SENSES WERE QUITE COLLECTED I
EXPLAINED HOW BESSIE HAD SENT HER HUSBAND TO FETCH ME FROM THORNFIELD
I AM VERY ILL I KNOW SHE SAID ERE LONG
I WAS TRYING TO TURN MYSELF
A FEW MINUTES SINCE AND FIND I CANNOT MOVE A LIMB
IT IS AS WELL I
SHOULD EASE MY MIND BEFORE I DIE WHAT WE THINK LITTLE OF IN HEALTH
BURDENS US AT SUCH AN HOUR AS THE PRESENT IS TO ME
IS THE NURSE HERE
OR IS THERE NO ONE IN THE ROOM BUT YOU
I ASSURED HER WE WERE ALONE
WELL I HAVE TWICE DONE YOU A WRONG WHICH I REGRET NOW
ONE WAS IN
BREAKING THE PROMISE WHICH I GAVE MY HUSBAND TO BRING YOU UP AS MY OWN
CHILD THE OTHER SHE STOPPED
AFTER ALL IT IS OF NO GREAT
IMPORTANCE PERHAPS SHE MURMURED TO HERSELF AND THEN I MAY GET
BETTER AND TO HUMBLE MYSELF SO TO HER IS PAINFUL
SHE MADE AN EFFORT TO ALTER HER POSITION BUT FAILED HER FACE CHANGED
SHE SEEMED TO EXPERIENCE SOME INWARD SENSATION THE PRECURSOR PERHAPS
OF THE LAST PANG
WELL I MUST GET IT OVER
ETERNITY IS BEFORE ME I HAD BETTER TELL
HER GO TO MY DRESSING CASE OPEN IT AND TAKE OUT A LETTER YOU WILL SEE
THERE
I OBEYED HER DIRECTIONS
READ THE LETTER SHE SAID
IT WAS SHORT AND THUS CONCEIVED
MADAM WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SEND ME THE ADDRESS OF MY
NIECE JANE EYRE AND TO TELL ME HOW SHE IS IT IS MY INTENTION TO
WRITE SHORTLY AND DESIRE HER TO COME TO ME AT MADEIRA
PROVIDENCE HAS
BLESSED MY ENDEAVOURS TO SECURE A COMPETENCY AND AS I AM UNMARRIED
AND CHILDLESS I WISH TO ADOPT HER DURING MY LIFE AND BEQUEATH HER AT
MY DEATH WHATEVER I MAY HAVE TO LEAVE I AM MADAM C C
JOHN EYRE MADEIRA
IT WAS DATED THREE YEARS BACK
WHY DID I NEVER HEAR OF THIS I ASKED
BECAUSE I DISLIKED YOU TOO FIXEDLY AND THOROUGHLY EVER TO LEND A HAND IN
LIFTING YOU TO PROSPERITY
I COULD NOT FORGET YOUR CONDUCT TO ME
JANE THE FURY WITH WHICH YOU ONCE TURNED ON ME THE TONE IN WHICH YOU
DECLARED YOU ABHORRED ME THE WORST OF ANYBODY IN THE WORLD THE
UNCHILDLIKE LOOK AND VOICE WITH WHICH YOU AFFIRMED THAT THE VERY THOUGHT
OF ME MADE YOU SICK AND ASSERTED THAT I HAD TREATED YOU WITH MISERABLE
CRUELTY
I COULD NOT FORGET MY OWN SENSATIONS WHEN YOU THUS STARTED UP
AND POURED OUT THE VENOM OF YOUR MIND I FELT FEAR AS IF AN ANIMAL THAT I
HAD STRUCK OR PUSHED HAD LOOKED UP AT ME WITH HUMAN EYES AND CURSED ME IN
A MAN'S VOICE BRING ME SOME WATER OH MAKE HASTE
DEAR MRS
REED SAID I AS I OFFERED HER THE DRAUGHT SHE REQUIRED
THINK NO MORE OF ALL THIS LET IT PASS AWAY FROM YOUR MIND
FORGIVE ME
FOR MY PASSIONATE LANGUAGE I WAS A CHILD THEN EIGHT NINE YEARS HAVE
PASSED SINCE THAT DAY
SHE HEEDED NOTHING OF WHAT I SAID BUT WHEN SHE HAD TASTED THE WATER AND
DRAWN BREATH SHE WENT ON THUS
I TELL YOU I COULD NOT FORGET IT AND I TOOK MY REVENGE FOR YOU TO BE
ADOPTED BY YOUR UNCLE AND PLACED IN A STATE OF EASE AND COMFORT WAS
WHAT I COULD NOT ENDURE
I WROTE TO HIM I SAID I WAS SORRY FOR HIS
DISAPPOINTMENT BUT JANE EYRE WAS DEAD SHE HAD DIED OF TYPHUS FEVER AT
LOWOOD
NOW ACT AS YOU PLEASE WRITE AND CONTRADICT MY ASSERTION EXPOSE
MY FALSEHOOD AS SOON AS YOU LIKE
YOU WERE BORN I THINK TO BE MY
TORMENT MY LAST HOUR IS RACKED BY THE RECOLLECTION OF A DEED WHICH BUT
FOR YOU I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO COMMIT
IF YOU COULD BUT BE PERSUADED TO THINK NO MORE OF IT AUNT AND TO
REGARD ME WITH KINDNESS AND FORGIVENESS
YOU HAVE A VERY BAD DISPOSITION SAID SHE AND ONE TO THIS DAY I FEEL
IT IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW FOR NINE YEARS YOU COULD BE PATIENT AND
QUIESCENT UNDER ANY TREATMENT AND IN THE TENTH BREAK OUT ALL FIRE AND
VIOLENCE I CAN NEVER COMPREHEND
MY DISPOSITION IS NOT SO BAD AS YOU THINK I AM PASSIONATE BUT NOT
VINDICTIVE
MANY A TIME AS A LITTLE CHILD I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO
LOVE YOU IF YOU WOULD HAVE LET ME AND I LONG EARNESTLY TO BE RECONCILED
TO YOU NOW KISS ME AUNT
I APPROACHED MY CHEEK TO HER LIPS SHE WOULD NOT TOUCH IT
SHE SAID I
OPPRESSED HER BY LEANING OVER THE BED AND AGAIN DEMANDED WATER
AS I
LAID HER DOWN FOR I RAISED HER AND SUPPORTED HER ON MY ARM WHILE SHE
DRANK I COVERED HER ICE COLD AND CLAMMY HAND WITH MINE THE FEEBLE
FINGERS SHRANK FROM MY TOUCH THE GLAZING EYES SHUNNED MY GAZE
LOVE ME THEN OR HATE ME AS YOU WILL I SAID AT LAST YOU HAVE MY
FULL AND FREE FORGIVENESS ASK NOW FOR GOD'S AND BE AT PEACE
POOR SUFFERING WOMAN IT WAS TOO LATE FOR HER TO MAKE NOW THE EFFORT TO
CHANGE HER HABITUAL FRAME OF MIND LIVING SHE HAD EVER HATED ME DYING
SHE MUST HATE ME STILL
THE NURSE NOW ENTERED AND BESSIE FOLLOWED
I YET LINGERED HALF AN HOUR
LONGER HOPING TO SEE SOME SIGN OF AMITY BUT SHE GAVE NONE
SHE WAS
FAST RELAPSING INTO STUPOR NOR DID HER MIND AGAIN RALLY AT TWELVE
O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT SHE DIED
I WAS NOT PRESENT TO CLOSE HER EYES NOR
WERE EITHER OF HER DAUGHTERS
THEY CAME TO TELL US THE NEXT MORNING THAT
ALL WAS OVER
SHE WAS BY THAT TIME LAID OUT
ELIZA AND I WENT TO LOOK
AT HER GEORGIANA WHO HAD BURST OUT INTO LOUD WEEPING SAID SHE DARED
NOT GO
THERE WAS STRETCHED SARAH REED'S ONCE ROBUST AND ACTIVE FRAME
RIGID AND STILL HER EYE OF FLINT WAS COVERED WITH ITS COLD LID HER BROW
AND STRONG TRAITS WORE YET THE IMPRESS OF HER INEXORABLE SOUL
A STRANGE
AND SOLEMN OBJECT WAS THAT CORPSE TO ME
I GAZED ON IT WITH GLOOM AND
PAIN NOTHING SOFT NOTHING SWEET NOTHING PITYING OR HOPEFUL OR
SUBDUING DID IT INSPIRE ONLY A GRATING ANGUISH FOR HER WOES NOT MY
LOSS AND A SOMBRE TEARLESS DISMAY AT THE FEARFULNESS OF DEATH IN SUCH A
FORM
ELIZA SURVEYED HER PARENT CALMLY
AFTER A SILENCE OF SOME MINUTES SHE
OBSERVED
WITH HER CONSTITUTION SHE SHOULD HAVE LIVED TO A GOOD OLD AGE HER LIFE
WAS SHORTENED BY TROUBLE AND THEN A SPASM CONSTRICTED HER MOUTH FOR AN
INSTANT AS IT PASSED AWAY SHE TURNED AND LEFT THE ROOM AND SO DID I
NEITHER OF US HAD DROPT A TEAR
CHAPTER XXII
MR
ROCHESTER HAD GIVEN ME BUT ONE WEEK'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE YET A MONTH
ELAPSED BEFORE I QUITTED GATESHEAD
I WISHED TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER
THE FUNERAL BUT GEORGIANA ENTREATED ME TO STAY TILL SHE COULD GET OFF TO
LONDON WHITHER SHE WAS NOW AT LAST INVITED BY HER UNCLE MR
GIBSON WHO
HAD COME DOWN TO DIRECT HIS SISTER'S INTERMENT AND SETTLE THE FAMILY
AFFAIRS
GEORGIANA SAID SHE DREADED BEING LEFT ALONE WITH ELIZA FROM
HER SHE GOT NEITHER SYMPATHY IN HER DEJECTION SUPPORT IN HER FEARS NOR
AID IN HER PREPARATIONS SO I BORE WITH HER FEEBLE MINDED WAILINGS AND
SELFISH LAMENTATIONS AS WELL AS I COULD AND DID MY BEST IN SEWING FOR
HER AND PACKING HER DRESSES
IT IS TRUE THAT WHILE I WORKED SHE WOULD
IDLE AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF YOU AND I WERE DESTINED TO LIVE ALWAYS
TOGETHER COUSIN WE WOULD COMMENCE MATTERS ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
I
SHOULD NOT SETTLE TAMELY DOWN INTO BEING THE FORBEARING PARTY I SHOULD
ASSIGN YOU YOUR SHARE OF LABOUR AND COMPEL YOU TO ACCOMPLISH IT OR ELSE
IT SHOULD BE LEFT UNDONE I SHOULD INSIST ALSO ON YOUR KEEPING SOME OF
THOSE DRAWLING HALF INSINCERE COMPLAINTS HUSHED IN YOUR OWN BREAST
IT
IS ONLY BECAUSE OUR CONNECTION HAPPENS TO BE VERY TRANSITORY AND COMES
AT A PECULIARLY MOURNFUL SEASON THAT I CONSENT THUS TO RENDER IT SO
PATIENT AND COMPLIANT ON MY PART
AT LAST I SAW GEORGIANA OFF BUT NOW IT WAS ELIZA'S TURN TO REQUEST ME TO
STAY ANOTHER WEEK
HER PLANS REQUIRED ALL HER TIME AND ATTENTION SHE
SAID SHE WAS ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SOME UNKNOWN BOURNE AND ALL DAY LONG
SHE STAYED IN HER OWN ROOM HER DOOR BOLTED WITHIN FILLING TRUNKS
EMPTYING DRAWERS BURNING PAPERS AND HOLDING NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANY
ONE
SHE WISHED ME TO LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE TO SEE CALLERS AND ANSWER
NOTES OF CONDOLENCE
ONE MORNING SHE TOLD ME I WAS AT LIBERTY
AND SHE ADDED I AM
OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR VALUABLE SERVICES AND DISCREET CONDUCT THERE IS
SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIVING WITH SUCH AN ONE AS YOU AND WITH
GEORGIANA YOU PERFORM YOUR OWN PART IN LIFE AND BURDEN NO ONE
TO MORROW SHE CONTINUED I SET OUT FOR THE CONTINENT
I SHALL TAKE UP
MY ABODE IN A RELIGIOUS HOUSE NEAR LISLE A NUNNERY YOU WOULD CALL IT
THERE I SHALL BE QUIET AND UNMOLESTED
I SHALL DEVOTE MYSELF FOR A TIME
TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC DOGMAS AND TO A CAREFUL STUDY
OF THE WORKINGS OF THEIR SYSTEM IF I FIND IT TO BE AS I HALF SUSPECT IT
IS THE ONE BEST CALCULATED TO ENSURE THE DOING OF ALL THINGS DECENTLY
AND IN ORDER I SHALL EMBRACE THE TENETS OF ROME AND PROBABLY TAKE THE
VEIL
I NEITHER EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT THIS RESOLUTION NOR ATTEMPTED TO DISSUADE
HER FROM IT
THE VOCATION WILL FIT YOU TO A HAIR I THOUGHT MUCH
GOOD MAY IT DO YOU
WHEN WE PARTED SHE SAID GOOD BYE COUSIN JANE EYRE I WISH YOU WELL
YOU HAVE SOME SENSE
I THEN RETURNED YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT SENSE COUSIN ELIZA BUT WHAT YOU
HAVE I SUPPOSE IN ANOTHER YEAR WILL BE WALLED UP ALIVE IN A FRENCH
CONVENT
HOWEVER IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS AND SO IT SUITS YOU I DON'T
MUCH CARE
YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT SAID SHE AND WITH THESE WORDS WE EACH WENT OUR
SEPARATE WAY
AS I SHALL NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFER EITHER TO HER OR HER
SISTER AGAIN I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE THAT GEORGIANA MADE AN
ADVANTAGEOUS MATCH WITH A WEALTHY WORN OUT MAN OF FASHION AND THAT ELIZA
ACTUALLY TOOK THE VEIL AND IS AT THIS DAY SUPERIOR OF THE CONVENT WHERE
SHE PASSED THE PERIOD OF HER NOVITIATE AND WHICH SHE ENDOWED WITH HER
FORTUNE
HOW PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY ARE RETURNING HOME FROM AN ABSENCE LONG OR
SHORT I DID NOT KNOW I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE SENSATION
I HAD
KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO COME BACK TO GATESHEAD WHEN A CHILD AFTER A LONG
WALK TO BE SCOLDED FOR LOOKING COLD OR GLOOMY AND LATER WHAT IT WAS TO
COME BACK FROM CHURCH TO LOWOOD TO LONG FOR A PLENTEOUS MEAL AND A GOOD
FIRE AND TO BE UNABLE TO GET EITHER
NEITHER OF THESE RETURNINGS WAS
VERY PLEASANT OR DESIRABLE NO MAGNET DREW ME TO A GIVEN POINT
INCREASING IN ITS STRENGTH OF ATTRACTION THE NEARER I CAME
THE RETURN
TO THORNFIELD WAS YET TO BE TRIED
MY JOURNEY SEEMED TEDIOUS VERY TEDIOUS FIFTY MILES ONE DAY A NIGHT
SPENT AT AN INN FIFTY MILES THE NEXT DAY
DURING THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS
I THOUGHT OF MRS
REED IN HER LAST MOMENTS I SAW HER DISFIGURED AND
DISCOLOURED FACE AND HEARD HER STRANGELY ALTERED VOICE
I MUSED ON THE
FUNERAL DAY THE COFFIN THE HEARSE THE BLACK TRAIN OF TENANTS AND
SERVANTS FEW WAS THE NUMBER OF RELATIVES THE GAPING VAULT THE SILENT
CHURCH THE SOLEMN SERVICE
THEN I THOUGHT OF ELIZA AND GEORGIANA I
BEHELD ONE THE CYNOSURE OF A BALL ROOM THE OTHER THE INMATE OF A CONVENT
CELL AND I DWELT ON AND ANALYSED THEIR SEPARATE PECULIARITIES OF PERSON
AND CHARACTER
THE EVENING ARRIVAL AT THE GREAT TOWN OF SCATTERED THESE
THOUGHTS NIGHT GAVE THEM QUITE ANOTHER TURN LAID DOWN ON MY TRAVELLER'S
BED I LEFT REMINISCENCE FOR ANTICIPATION
I WAS GOING BACK TO THORNFIELD BUT HOW LONG WAS I TO STAY THERE NOT
LONG OF THAT I WAS SURE
I HAD HEARD FROM MRS
FAIRFAX IN THE INTERIM
OF MY ABSENCE THE PARTY AT THE HALL WAS DISPERSED MR
ROCHESTER HAD
LEFT FOR LONDON THREE WEEKS AGO BUT HE WAS THEN EXPECTED TO RETURN IN A
FORTNIGHT
MRS
FAIRFAX SURMISED THAT HE WAS GONE TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR HIS WEDDING AS HE HAD TALKED OF PURCHASING A NEW CARRIAGE SHE SAID
THE IDEA OF HIS MARRYING MISS INGRAM STILL SEEMED STRANGE TO HER BUT
FROM WHAT EVERYBODY SAID AND FROM WHAT SHE HAD HERSELF SEEN SHE COULD
NO LONGER DOUBT THAT THE EVENT WOULD SHORTLY TAKE PLACE
YOU WOULD BE
STRANGELY INCREDULOUS IF YOU DID DOUBT IT WAS MY MENTAL COMMENT
I
DON'T DOUBT IT
THE QUESTION FOLLOWED WHERE WAS I TO GO I DREAMT OF MISS INGRAM ALL
THE NIGHT IN A VIVID MORNING DREAM I SAW HER CLOSING THE GATES OF
THORNFIELD AGAINST ME AND POINTING ME OUT ANOTHER ROAD AND MR
ROCHESTER
LOOKED ON WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED SMILING SARDONICALLY AS IT SEEMED AT
BOTH HER AND ME
I HAD NOT NOTIFIED TO MRS
FAIRFAX THE EXACT DAY OF MY RETURN FOR I DID
NOT WISH EITHER CAR OR CARRIAGE TO MEET ME AT MILLCOTE
I PROPOSED TO
WALK THE DISTANCE QUIETLY BY MYSELF AND VERY QUIETLY AFTER LEAVING MY
BOX IN THE OSTLER'S CARE DID I SLIP AWAY FROM THE GEORGE INN ABOUT SIX
O'CLOCK OF A JUNE EVENING AND TAKE THE OLD ROAD TO THORNFIELD A ROAD
WHICH LAY CHIEFLY THROUGH FIELDS AND WAS NOW LITTLE FREQUENTED
IT WAS NOT A BRIGHT OR SPLENDID SUMMER EVENING THOUGH FAIR AND SOFT THE
HAYMAKERS WERE AT WORK ALL ALONG THE ROAD AND THE SKY THOUGH FAR FROM
CLOUDLESS WAS SUCH AS PROMISED WELL FOR THE FUTURE ITS BLUE WHERE BLUE
WAS VISIBLE WAS MILD AND SETTLED AND ITS CLOUD STRATA HIGH AND THIN
THE WEST TOO WAS WARM NO WATERY GLEAM CHILLED IT IT SEEMED AS IF
THERE WAS A FIRE LIT AN ALTAR BURNING BEHIND ITS SCREEN OF MARBLED
VAPOUR AND OUT OF APERTURES SHONE A GOLDEN REDNESS
I FELT GLAD AS THE ROAD SHORTENED BEFORE ME SO GLAD THAT I STOPPED ONCE
TO ASK MYSELF WHAT THAT JOY MEANT AND TO REMIND REASON THAT IT WAS NOT
TO MY HOME I WAS GOING OR TO A PERMANENT RESTING PLACE OR TO A PLACE
WHERE FOND FRIENDS LOOKED OUT FOR ME AND WAITED MY ARRIVAL
MRS
FAIRFAX WILL SMILE YOU A CALM WELCOME TO BE SURE SAID I AND LITTLE
ADELE WILL CLAP HER HANDS AND JUMP TO SEE YOU BUT YOU KNOW VERY WELL YOU
ARE THINKING OF ANOTHER THAN THEY AND THAT HE IS NOT THINKING OF YOU
BUT WHAT IS SO HEADSTRONG AS YOUTH WHAT SO BLIND AS INEXPERIENCE THESE
AFFIRMED THAT IT WAS PLEASURE ENOUGH TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF AGAIN
LOOKING ON MR
ROCHESTER WHETHER HE LOOKED ON ME OR NOT AND THEY
ADDED HASTEN HASTEN BE WITH HIM WHILE YOU MAY BUT A FEW MORE DAYS OR
WEEKS AT MOST AND YOU ARE PARTED FROM HIM FOR EVER AND THEN I
STRANGLED A NEW BORN AGONY A DEFORMED THING WHICH I COULD NOT PERSUADE
MYSELF TO OWN AND REAR AND RAN ON
THEY ARE MAKING HAY TOO IN THORNFIELD MEADOWS OR RATHER THE LABOURERS
ARE JUST QUITTING THEIR WORK AND RETURNING HOME WITH THEIR RAKES ON
THEIR SHOULDERS NOW AT THE HOUR I ARRIVE
I HAVE BUT A FIELD OR TWO TO
TRAVERSE AND THEN I SHALL CROSS THE ROAD AND REACH THE GATES
HOW FULL
THE HEDGES ARE OF ROSES BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO GATHER ANY I WANT TO BE
AT THE HOUSE
I PASSED A TALL BRIAR SHOOTING LEAFY AND FLOWERY BRANCHES
ACROSS THE PATH I SEE THE NARROW STILE WITH STONE STEPS AND I SEE MR
ROCHESTER SITTING THERE A BOOK AND A PENCIL IN HIS HAND HE IS WRITING
WELL HE IS NOT A GHOST YET EVERY NERVE I HAVE IS UNSTRUNG FOR A MOMENT
I AM BEYOND MY OWN MASTERY
WHAT DOES IT MEAN I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD
TREMBLE IN THIS WAY WHEN I SAW HIM OR LOSE MY VOICE OR THE POWER OF
MOTION IN HIS PRESENCE
I WILL GO BACK AS SOON AS I CAN STIR I NEED NOT
MAKE AN ABSOLUTE FOOL OF MYSELF
I KNOW ANOTHER WAY TO THE HOUSE
IT
DOES NOT SIGNIFY IF I KNEW TWENTY WAYS FOR HE HAS SEEN ME
HILLO HE CRIES AND HE PUTS UP HIS BOOK AND HIS PENCIL
THERE YOU
ARE COME ON IF YOU PLEASE
I SUPPOSE I DO COME ON THOUGH IN WHAT FASHION I KNOW NOT BEING SCARCELY
COGNISANT OF MY MOVEMENTS AND SOLICITOUS ONLY TO APPEAR CALM AND ABOVE
ALL TO CONTROL THE WORKING MUSCLES OF MY FACE WHICH I FEEL REBEL
INSOLENTLY AGAINST MY WILL AND STRUGGLE TO EXPRESS WHAT I HAD RESOLVED
TO CONCEAL
BUT I HAVE A VEIL IT IS DOWN I MAY MAKE SHIFT YET TO
BEHAVE WITH DECENT COMPOSURE
AND THIS IS JANE EYRE ARE YOU COMING FROM MILLCOTE AND ON FOOT
YES JUST ONE OF YOUR TRICKS NOT TO SEND FOR A CARRIAGE AND COME
CLATTERING OVER STREET AND ROAD LIKE A COMMON MORTAL BUT TO STEAL INTO
THE VICINAGE OF YOUR HOME ALONG WITH TWILIGHT JUST AS IF YOU WERE A
DREAM OR A SHADE
WHAT THE DEUCE HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOURSELF THIS LAST
MONTH
I HAVE BEEN WITH MY AUNT SIR WHO IS DEAD
A TRUE JANIAN REPLY GOOD ANGELS BE MY GUARD SHE COMES FROM THE OTHER
WORLD FROM THE ABODE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD AND TELLS ME SO WHEN SHE
MEETS ME ALONE HERE IN THE GLOAMING IF I DARED I'D TOUCH YOU TO SEE
IF YOU ARE SUBSTANCE OR SHADOW YOU ELF BUT I'D AS SOON OFFER TO TAKE
HOLD OF A BLUE IGNIS FATUUS LIGHT IN A MARSH
TRUANT TRUANT HE
ADDED WHEN HE HAD PAUSED AN INSTANT
ABSENT FROM ME A WHOLE MONTH AND
FORGETTING ME QUITE I'LL BE SWORN
I KNEW THERE WOULD BE PLEASURE IN MEETING MY MASTER AGAIN EVEN THOUGH
BROKEN BY THE FEAR THAT HE WAS SO SOON TO CEASE TO BE MY MASTER AND BY
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS NOTHING TO HIM BUT THERE WAS EVER IN MR
ROCHESTER SO AT LEAST I THOUGHT SUCH A WEALTH OF THE POWER OF
COMMUNICATING HAPPINESS THAT TO TASTE BUT OF THE CRUMBS HE SCATTERED TO
STRAY AND STRANGER BIRDS LIKE ME WAS TO FEAST GENIALLY
HIS LAST WORDS
WERE BALM THEY SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT IT IMPORTED SOMETHING TO HIM WHETHER
I FORGOT HIM OR NOT
AND HE HAD SPOKEN OF THORNFIELD AS MY HOME WOULD
THAT IT WERE MY HOME
HE DID NOT LEAVE THE STILE AND I HARDLY LIKED TO ASK TO GO BY
I
INQUIRED SOON IF HE HAD NOT BEEN TO LONDON
YES I SUPPOSE YOU FOUND THAT OUT BY SECOND SIGHT
MRS
FAIRFAX TOLD ME IN A LETTER
AND DID SHE INFORM YOU WHAT I WENT TO DO
OH YES SIR EVERYBODY KNEW YOUR ERRAND
YOU MUST SEE THE CARRIAGE JANE AND TELL ME IF YOU DON'T THINK IT WILL
SUIT MRS
ROCHESTER EXACTLY AND WHETHER SHE WON'T LOOK LIKE QUEEN
BOADICEA LEANING BACK AGAINST THOSE PURPLE CUSHIONS
I WISH JANE I
WERE A TRIFLE BETTER ADAPTED TO MATCH WITH HER EXTERNALLY
TELL ME NOW
FAIRY AS YOU ARE CAN'T YOU GIVE ME A CHARM OR A PHILTER OR SOMETHING
OF THAT SORT TO MAKE ME A HANDSOME MAN
IT WOULD BE PAST THE POWER OF MAGIC SIR AND IN THOUGHT I ADDED A
LOVING EYE IS ALL THE CHARM NEEDED TO SUCH YOU ARE HANDSOME ENOUGH OR
RATHER YOUR STERNNESS HAS A POWER BEYOND BEAUTY
MR
ROCHESTER HAD SOMETIMES READ MY UNSPOKEN THOUGHTS WITH AN ACUMEN TO
ME INCOMPREHENSIBLE IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF MY
ABRUPT VOCAL RESPONSE BUT HE SMILED AT ME WITH A CERTAIN SMILE HE HAD OF
HIS OWN AND WHICH HE USED BUT ON RARE OCCASIONS
HE SEEMED TO THINK IT
TOO GOOD FOR COMMON PURPOSES IT WAS THE REAL SUNSHINE OF FEELING HE
SHED IT OVER ME NOW
PASS JANET SAID HE MAKING ROOM FOR ME TO CROSS THE STILE GO UP
HOME AND STAY YOUR WEARY LITTLE WANDERING FEET AT A FRIEND'S THRESHOLD
ALL I HAD NOW TO DO WAS TO OBEY HIM IN SILENCE NO NEED FOR ME TO
COLLOQUISE FURTHER
I GOT OVER THE STILE WITHOUT A WORD AND MEANT TO
LEAVE HIM CALMLY
AN IMPULSE HELD ME FAST A FORCE TURNED ME ROUND
I
SAID OR SOMETHING IN ME SAID FOR ME AND IN SPITE OF ME
THANK YOU MR
ROCHESTER FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS
I AM STRANGELY GLAD
TO GET BACK AGAIN TO YOU AND WHEREVER YOU ARE IS MY HOME MY ONLY HOME
I WALKED ON SO FAST THAT EVEN HE COULD HARDLY HAVE OVERTAKEN ME HAD HE
TRIED
LITTLE ADELE WAS HALF WILD WITH DELIGHT WHEN SHE SAW ME
MRS
FAIRFAX RECEIVED ME WITH HER USUAL PLAIN FRIENDLINESS
LEAH SMILED AND
EVEN SOPHIE BID ME BON SOIR WITH GLEE
THIS WAS VERY PLEASANT THERE
IS NO HAPPINESS LIKE THAT OF BEING LOVED BY YOUR FELLOW CREATURES AND
FEELING THAT YOUR PRESENCE IS AN ADDITION TO THEIR COMFORT
I THAT EVENING SHUT MY EYES RESOLUTELY AGAINST THE FUTURE I STOPPED MY
EARS AGAINST THE VOICE THAT KEPT WARNING ME OF NEAR SEPARATION AND COMING
GRIEF
WHEN TEA WAS OVER AND MRS
FAIRFAX HAD TAKEN HER KNITTING AND I
HAD ASSUMED A LOW SEAT NEAR HER AND ADELE KNEELING ON THE CARPET HAD
NESTLED CLOSE UP TO ME AND A SENSE OF MUTUAL AFFECTION SEEMED TO
SURROUND US WITH A RING OF GOLDEN PEACE I UTTERED A SILENT PRAYER THAT
WE MIGHT NOT BE PARTED FAR OR SOON BUT WHEN AS WE THUS SAT MR
ROCHESTER ENTERED UNANNOUNCED AND LOOKING AT US SEEMED TO TAKE
PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF A GROUP SO AMICABLE WHEN HE SAID HE
SUPPOSED THE OLD LADY WAS ALL RIGHT NOW THAT SHE HAD GOT HER ADOPTED
DAUGHTER BACK AGAIN AND ADDED THAT HE SAW ADELE WAS PRETE A CROQUER SA
PETITE MAMAN ANGLAISE I HALF VENTURED TO HOPE THAT HE WOULD EVEN AFTER
HIS MARRIAGE KEEP US TOGETHER SOMEWHERE UNDER THE SHELTER OF HIS
PROTECTION AND NOT QUITE EXILED FROM THE SUNSHINE OF HIS PRESENCE
A FORTNIGHT OF DUBIOUS CALM SUCCEEDED MY RETURN TO THORNFIELD HALL
NOTHING WAS SAID OF THE MASTER'S MARRIAGE AND I SAW NO PREPARATION GOING
ON FOR SUCH AN EVENT
ALMOST EVERY DAY I ASKED MRS
FAIRFAX IF SHE HAD
YET HEARD ANYTHING DECIDED HER ANSWER WAS ALWAYS IN THE NEGATIVE
ONCE
SHE SAID SHE HAD ACTUALLY PUT THE QUESTION TO MR
ROCHESTER AS TO WHEN HE
WAS GOING TO BRING HIS BRIDE HOME BUT HE HAD ANSWERED HER ONLY BY A JOKE
AND ONE OF HIS QUEER LOOKS AND SHE COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO MAKE OF HIM
ONE THING SPECIALLY SURPRISED ME AND THAT WAS THERE WERE NO JOURNEYINGS
BACKWARD AND FORWARD NO VISITS TO INGRAM PARK TO BE SURE IT WAS TWENTY
MILES OFF ON THE BORDERS OF ANOTHER COUNTY BUT WHAT WAS THAT DISTANCE
TO AN ARDENT LOVER TO SO PRACTISED AND INDEFATIGABLE A HORSEMAN AS MR
ROCHESTER IT WOULD BE BUT A MORNING'S RIDE
I BEGAN TO CHERISH HOPES I
HAD NO RIGHT TO CONCEIVE THAT THE MATCH WAS BROKEN OFF THAT RUMOUR HAD
BEEN MISTAKEN THAT ONE OR BOTH PARTIES HAD CHANGED THEIR MINDS
I USED
TO LOOK AT MY MASTER'S FACE TO SEE IF IT WERE SAD OR FIERCE BUT I COULD
NOT REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN IT HAD BEEN SO UNIFORMLY CLEAR OF CLOUDS OR
EVIL FEELINGS
IF IN THE MOMENTS I AND MY PUPIL SPENT WITH HIM I
LACKED SPIRITS AND SANK INTO INEVITABLE DEJECTION HE BECAME EVEN GAY
NEVER HAD HE CALLED ME MORE FREQUENTLY TO HIS PRESENCE NEVER BEEN KINDER
TO ME WHEN THERE AND ALAS NEVER HAD I LOVED HIM SO WELL
CHAPTER XXIII
A SPLENDID MIDSUMMER SHONE OVER ENGLAND SKIES SO PURE SUNS SO RADIANT
AS WERE THEN SEEN IN LONG SUCCESSION SELDOM FAVOUR EVEN SINGLY OUR WAVE
GIRT LAND
IT WAS AS IF A BAND OF ITALIAN DAYS HAD COME FROM THE SOUTH
LIKE A FLOCK OF GLORIOUS PASSENGER BIRDS AND LIGHTED TO REST THEM ON THE
CLIFFS OF ALBION
THE HAY WAS ALL GOT IN THE FIELDS ROUND THORNFIELD
WERE GREEN AND SHORN THE ROADS WHITE AND BAKED THE TREES WERE IN THEIR
DARK PRIME HEDGE AND WOOD FULL LEAVED AND DEEPLY TINTED CONTRASTED
WELL WITH THE SUNNY HUE OF THE CLEARED MEADOWS BETWEEN
ON MIDSUMMER EVE ADELE WEARY WITH GATHERING WILD STRAWBERRIES IN HAY
LANE HALF THE DAY HAD GONE TO BED WITH THE SUN
I WATCHED HER DROP
ASLEEP AND WHEN I LEFT HER I SOUGHT THE GARDEN
IT WAS NOW THE SWEETEST HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR DAY ITS FERVID FIRES
HAD WASTED AND DEW FELL COOL ON PANTING PLAIN AND SCORCHED SUMMIT
WHERE THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN IN SIMPLE STATE PURE OF THE POMP OF
CLOUDS SPREAD A SOLEMN PURPLE BURNING WITH THE LIGHT OF RED JEWEL AND
FURNACE FLAME AT ONE POINT ON ONE HILL PEAK AND EXTENDING HIGH AND
WIDE SOFT AND STILL SOFTER OVER HALF HEAVEN
THE EAST HAD ITS OWN
CHARM OR FINE DEEP BLUE AND ITS OWN MODEST GEM A CASINO AND SOLITARY
STAR SOON IT WOULD BOAST THE MOON BUT SHE WAS YET BENEATH THE HORIZON
I WALKED A WHILE ON THE PAVEMENT BUT A SUBTLE WELL KNOWN SCENT THAT OF
A CIGAR STOLE FROM SOME WINDOW I SAW THE LIBRARY CASEMENT OPEN A
HANDBREADTH I KNEW I MIGHT BE WATCHED THENCE SO I WENT APART INTO THE
ORCHARD
NO NOOK IN THE GROUNDS MORE SHELTERED AND MORE EDEN LIKE IT
WAS FULL OF TREES IT BLOOMED WITH FLOWERS A VERY HIGH WALL SHUT IT OUT
FROM THE COURT ON ONE SIDE ON THE OTHER A BEECH AVENUE SCREENED IT
FROM THE LAWN
AT THE BOTTOM WAS A SUNK FENCE ITS SOLE SEPARATION FROM
LONELY FIELDS A WINDING WALK BORDERED WITH LAURELS AND TERMINATING IN A
GIANT HORSE CHESTNUT CIRCLED AT THE BASE BY A SEAT LED DOWN TO THE
FENCE
HERE ONE COULD WANDER UNSEEN
WHILE SUCH HONEY DEW FELL SUCH
SILENCE REIGNED SUCH GLOAMING GATHERED I FELT AS IF I COULD HAUNT SUCH
SHADE FOR EVER BUT IN THREADING THE FLOWER AND FRUIT PARTERRES AT THE
UPPER PART OF THE ENCLOSURE ENTICED THERE BY THE LIGHT THE NOW RISING
MOON CAST ON THIS MORE OPEN QUARTER MY STEP IS STAYED NOT BY SOUND NOT
BY SIGHT BUT ONCE MORE BY A WARNING FRAGRANCE
SWEET BRIAR AND SOUTHERNWOOD JASMINE PINK AND ROSE HAVE LONG BEEN
YIELDING THEIR EVENING SACRIFICE OF INCENSE THIS NEW SCENT IS NEITHER OF
SHRUB NOR FLOWER IT IS I KNOW IT WELL IT IS MR
ROCHESTER'S CIGAR
I
LOOK ROUND AND I LISTEN
I SEE TREES LADEN WITH RIPENING FRUIT
I HEAR
A NIGHTINGALE WARBLING IN A WOOD HALF A MILE OFF NO MOVING FORM IS
VISIBLE NO COMING STEP AUDIBLE BUT THAT PERFUME INCREASES I MUST FLEE
I MAKE FOR THE WICKET LEADING TO THE SHRUBBERY AND I SEE MR
ROCHESTER
ENTERING
I STEP ASIDE INTO THE IVY RECESS HE WILL NOT STAY LONG HE
WILL SOON RETURN WHENCE HE CAME AND IF I SIT STILL HE WILL NEVER SEE ME
BUT NO EVENTIDE IS AS PLEASANT TO HIM AS TO ME AND THIS ANTIQUE GARDEN
AS ATTRACTIVE AND HE STROLLS ON NOW LIFTING THE GOOSEBERRY TREE
BRANCHES TO LOOK AT THE FRUIT LARGE AS PLUMS WITH WHICH THEY ARE LADEN
NOW TAKING A RIPE CHERRY FROM THE WALL NOW STOOPING TOWARDS A KNOT OF
FLOWERS EITHER TO INHALE THEIR FRAGRANCE OR TO ADMIRE THE DEW BEADS ON
THEIR PETALS
A GREAT MOTH GOES HUMMING BY ME IT ALIGHTS ON A PLANT AT
MR
ROCHESTER'S FOOT HE SEES IT AND BENDS TO EXAMINE IT
NOW HE HAS HIS BACK TOWARDS ME THOUGHT I AND HE IS OCCUPIED TOO
PERHAPS IF I WALK SOFTLY I CAN SLIP AWAY UNNOTICED
I TRODE ON AN EDGING OF TURF THAT THE CRACKLE OF THE PEBBLY GRAVEL MIGHT
NOT BETRAY ME HE WAS STANDING AMONG THE BEDS AT A YARD OR TWO DISTANT
FROM WHERE I HAD TO PASS THE MOTH APPARENTLY ENGAGED HIM
I SHALL GET
BY VERY WELL I MEDITATED
AS I CROSSED HIS SHADOW THROWN LONG OVER
THE GARDEN BY THE MOON NOT YET RISEN HIGH HE SAID QUIETLY WITHOUT
TURNING
JANE COME AND LOOK AT THIS FELLOW
I HAD MADE NO NOISE HE HAD NOT EYES BEHIND COULD HIS SHADOW FEEL I
STARTED AT FIRST AND THEN I APPROACHED HIM
LOOK AT HIS WINGS SAID HE HE REMINDS ME RATHER OF A WEST INDIAN
INSECT ONE DOES NOT OFTEN SEE SO LARGE AND GAY A NIGHT ROVER IN ENGLAND
THERE HE IS FLOWN
THE MOTH ROAMED AWAY
I WAS SHEEPISHLY RETREATING ALSO BUT MR
ROCHESTER FOLLOWED ME AND WHEN WE REACHED THE WICKET HE SAID
TURN BACK ON SO LOVELY A NIGHT IT IS A SHAME TO SIT IN THE HOUSE AND
SURELY NO ONE CAN WISH TO GO TO BED WHILE SUNSET IS THUS AT MEETING WITH
MOONRISE
IT IS ONE OF MY FAULTS THAT THOUGH MY TONGUE IS SOMETIMES PROMPT ENOUGH
AT AN ANSWER THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT SADLY FAILS ME IN FRAMING AN
EXCUSE AND ALWAYS THE LAPSE OCCURS AT SOME CRISIS WHEN A FACILE WORD OR
PLAUSIBLE PRETEXT IS SPECIALLY WANTED TO GET ME OUT OF PAINFUL
EMBARRASSMENT
I DID NOT LIKE TO WALK AT THIS HOUR ALONE WITH MR
ROCHESTER IN THE SHADOWY ORCHARD BUT I COULD NOT FIND A REASON TO ALLEGE
FOR LEAVING HIM
I FOLLOWED WITH LAGGING STEP AND THOUGHTS BUSILY BENT
ON DISCOVERING A MEANS OF EXTRICATION BUT HE HIMSELF LOOKED SO COMPOSED
AND SO GRAVE ALSO I BECAME ASHAMED OF FEELING ANY CONFUSION THE EVIL IF
EVIL EXISTENT OR PROSPECTIVE THERE WAS SEEMED TO LIE WITH ME ONLY HIS
MIND WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND QUIET
JANE HE RECOMMENCED AS WE ENTERED THE LAUREL WALK AND SLOWLY STRAYED
DOWN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUNK FENCE AND THE HORSE CHESTNUT
THORNFIELD IS A PLEASANT PLACE IN SUMMER IS IT NOT
YES SIR
YOU MUST HAVE BECOME IN SOME DEGREE ATTACHED TO THE HOUSE YOU WHO
HAVE AN EYE FOR NATURAL BEAUTIES AND A GOOD DEAL OF THE ORGAN OF
ADHESIVENESS
I AM ATTACHED TO IT INDEED
AND THOUGH I DON'T COMPREHEND HOW IT IS I PERCEIVE YOU HAVE ACQUIRED A
DEGREE OF REGARD FOR THAT FOOLISH LITTLE CHILD ADELE TOO AND EVEN FOR
SIMPLE DAME FAIRFAX
YES SIR IN DIFFERENT WAYS I HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR BOTH
AND WOULD BE SORRY TO PART WITH THEM
YES
PITY HE SAID AND SIGHED AND PAUSED
IT IS ALWAYS THE WAY OF EVENTS
IN THIS LIFE HE CONTINUED PRESENTLY NO SOONER HAVE YOU GOT SETTLED IN
A PLEASANT RESTING PLACE THAN A VOICE CALLS OUT TO YOU TO RISE AND MOVE
ON FOR THE HOUR OF REPOSE IS EXPIRED
MUST I MOVE ON SIR I ASKED

GOING TO SAY I SUPPOSE I MAY STAY HERE TILL I FIND ANOTHER SHELTER TO
BETAKE MYSELF TO BUT I STOPPED FEELING IT WOULD NOT DO TO RISK A LONG
SENTENCE FOR MY VOICE WAS NOT QUITE UNDER COMMAND
IN ABOUT A MONTH I HOPE TO BE A BRIDEGROOM CONTINUED MR
ROCHESTER
AND IN THE INTERIM I SHALL MYSELF LOOK OUT FOR EMPLOYMENT AND AN ASYLUM
FOR YOU
THANK YOU SIR I AM SORRY TO GIVE
OH NO NEED TO APOLOGISE I CONSIDER THAT WHEN A DEPENDENT DOES HER
DUTY AS WELL AS YOU HAVE DONE YOURS SHE HAS A SORT OF CLAIM UPON HER
EMPLOYER FOR ANY LITTLE ASSISTANCE HE CAN CONVENIENTLY RENDER HER INDEED
I HAVE ALREADY THROUGH MY FUTURE MOTHER IN LAW HEARD OF A PLACE THAT I
THINK WILL SUIT IT IS TO UNDERTAKE THE EDUCATION OF THE FIVE DAUGHTERS
OF MRS

LIKE IRELAND I THINK THEY'RE SUCH WARM HEARTED PEOPLE THERE THEY SAY
IT IS A LONG WAY OFF SIR
NO MATTER A GIRL OF YOUR SENSE WILL NOT OBJECT TO THE VOYAGE OR THE
DISTANCE
NOT THE VOYAGE BUT THE DISTANCE AND THEN THE SEA IS A BARRIER
FROM WHAT JANE
FROM ENGLAND AND FROM THORNFIELD AND
WELL
FROM YOU SIR
I SAID THIS ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY AND WITH AS LITTLE SANCTION OF FREE
WILL MY TEARS GUSHED OUT
I DID NOT CRY SO AS TO BE HEARD HOWEVER I
AVOIDED SOBBING
THE THOUGHT OF MRS
O'GALL AND BITTERNUTT LODGE STRUCK
COLD TO MY HEART AND COLDER THE THOUGHT OF ALL THE BRINE AND FOAM
DESTINED AS IT SEEMED TO RUSH BETWEEN ME AND THE MASTER AT WHOSE SIDE I
NOW WALKED AND COLDEST THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE WIDER OCEAN WEALTH
CASTE CUSTOM INTERVENED BETWEEN ME AND WHAT I NATURALLY AND INEVITABLY
LOVED

I
NEVER GO OVER TO IRELAND NOT HAVING MYSELF MUCH OF A FANCY FOR THE
COUNTRY
WE HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS JANE HAVE WE NOT

LITTLE TIME THAT REMAINS TO THEM CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
COME WE'LL TALK
OVER THE VOYAGE AND THE PARTING QUIETLY HALF AN HOUR OR SO WHILE THE
STARS ENTER INTO THEIR SHINING LIFE UP IN HEAVEN YONDER HERE IS THE
CHESTNUT TREE HERE IS THE BENCH AT ITS OLD ROOTS
COME WE WILL SIT
THERE IN PEACE TO NIGHT THOUGH WE SHOULD NEVER MORE BE DESTINED TO SIT
THERE TOGETHER HE SEATED ME AND HIMSELF
IT IS A LONG WAY TO IRELAND JANET AND I AM SORRY TO SEND MY LITTLE
FRIEND ON SUCH WEARY TRAVELS BUT IF I CAN'T DO BETTER HOW IS IT TO BE
HELPED ARE YOU ANYTHING AKIN TO ME DO YOU THINK JANE
I COULD RISK NO SORT OF ANSWER BY THIS TIME MY HEART WAS STILL
BECAUSE HE SAID I SOMETIMES HAVE A QUEER FEELING WITH REGARD TO
YOU ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE NEAR ME AS NOW IT IS AS IF I HAD A STRING
SOMEWHERE UNDER MY LEFT RIBS TIGHTLY AND INEXTRICABLY KNOTTED TO A
SIMILAR STRING SITUATED IN THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF YOUR LITTLE
FRAME
AND IF THAT BOISTEROUS CHANNEL AND TWO HUNDRED MILES OR SO OF
LAND COME BROAD BETWEEN US I AM AFRAID THAT CORD OF COMMUNION WILL BE
SNAPT AND THEN I'VE A NERVOUS NOTION I SHOULD TAKE TO BLEEDING INWARDLY
AS FOR YOU YOU'D FORGET ME
THAT I NEVER SHOULD SIR YOU KNOW IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED
JANE DO YOU HEAR THAT NIGHTINGALE SINGING IN THE WOOD LISTEN
IN LISTENING I SOBBED CONVULSIVELY FOR I COULD REPRESS WHAT I ENDURED
NO LONGER I WAS OBLIGED TO YIELD AND I WAS SHAKEN FROM HEAD TO FOOT
WITH ACUTE DISTRESS
WHEN I DID SPEAK IT WAS ONLY TO EXPRESS AN
IMPETUOUS WISH THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN BORN OR NEVER COME TO THORNFIELD
BECAUSE YOU ARE SORRY TO LEAVE IT
THE VEHEMENCE OF EMOTION STIRRED BY GRIEF AND LOVE WITHIN ME WAS
CLAIMING MASTERY AND STRUGGLING FOR FULL SWAY AND ASSERTING A RIGHT TO
PREDOMINATE TO OVERCOME TO LIVE RISE AND REIGN AT LAST YES AND TO
SPEAK
I GRIEVE TO LEAVE THORNFIELD I LOVE THORNFIELD I LOVE IT BECAUSE I
HAVE LIVED IN IT A FULL AND DELIGHTFUL LIFE MOMENTARILY AT LEAST
I
HAVE NOT BEEN TRAMPLED ON
I HAVE NOT BEEN PETRIFIED
I HAVE NOT BEEN
BURIED WITH INFERIOR MINDS AND EXCLUDED FROM EVERY GLIMPSE OF COMMUNION
WITH WHAT IS BRIGHT AND ENERGETIC AND HIGH
I HAVE TALKED FACE TO FACE
WITH WHAT I REVERENCE WITH WHAT I DELIGHT IN WITH AN ORIGINAL A
VIGOROUS AN EXPANDED MIND
I HAVE KNOWN YOU MR
ROCHESTER AND IT
STRIKES ME WITH TERROR AND ANGUISH TO FEEL I ABSOLUTELY MUST BE TORN FROM
YOU FOR EVER

AUTOMATON A MACHINE WITHOUT FEELINGS AND CAN BEAR TO HAVE MY MORSEL OF
BREAD SNATCHED FROM MY LIPS AND MY DROP OF LIVING WATER DASHED FROM MY
CUP DO YOU THINK BECAUSE I AM POOR OBSCURE PLAIN AND LITTLE I AM
SOULLESS AND HEARTLESS YOU THINK WRONG I HAVE AS MUCH SOUL AS
YOU AND FULL AS MUCH HEART AND IF GOD HAD GIFTED ME WITH SOME BEAUTY
AND MUCH WEALTH I SHOULD HAVE MADE IT AS HARD FOR YOU TO LEAVE ME AS IT
IS NOW FOR ME TO LEAVE YOU
I AM NOT TALKING TO YOU NOW THROUGH THE
MEDIUM OF CUSTOM CONVENTIONALITIES NOR EVEN OF MORTAL FLESH IT IS MY
SPIRIT THAT ADDRESSES YOUR SPIRIT JUST AS IF BOTH HAD PASSED THROUGH THE
GRAVE AND WE STOOD AT GOD'S FEET EQUAL AS WE ARE

ARMS

TOO
A WAFT OF WIND CAME SWEEPING DOWN THE LAUREL WALK AND TREMBLED THROUGH
THE BOUGHS OF THE CHESTNUT IT WANDERED AWAY AWAY TO AN INDEFINITE
DISTANCE IT DIED
THE NIGHTINGALE'S SONG WAS THEN THE ONLY VOICE OF THE
HOUR IN LISTENING TO IT I AGAIN WEPT
MR
ROCHESTER SAT QUIET LOOKING
AT ME GENTLY AND SERIOUSLY
SOME TIME PASSED BEFORE HE SPOKE HE AT LAST

GOD PARDON ME HE SUBJOINED ERE LONG AND MAN MEDDLE NOT WITH ME I
HAVE HER AND WILL HOLD HER
THERE IS NO ONE TO MEDDLE SIR
I HAVE NO KINDRED TO INTERFERE
NO THAT IS THE BEST OF IT HE SAID
AND IF I HAD LOVED HIM LESS I
SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIS ACCENT AND LOOK OF EXULTATION SAVAGE BUT
SITTING BY HIM ROUSED FROM THE NIGHTMARE OF PARTING CALLED TO THE
PARADISE OF UNION I THOUGHT ONLY OF THE BLISS GIVEN ME TO DRINK IN SO
ABUNDANT A FLOW
AGAIN AND AGAIN HE SAID ARE YOU HAPPY JANE AND
AGAIN AND AGAIN I ANSWERED YES AFTER WHICH HE MURMURED IT WILL
ATONE IT WILL ATONE
HAVE I NOT FOUND HER FRIENDLESS AND COLD AND
COMFORTLESS WILL I NOT GUARD AND CHERISH AND SOLACE HER IS THERE
NOT LOVE IN MY HEART AND CONSTANCY IN MY RESOLVES IT WILL EXPIATE AT
GOD'S TRIBUNAL
I KNOW MY MAKER SANCTIONS WHAT I DO
FOR THE WORLD'S
JUDGMENT I WASH MY HANDS THEREOF
FOR MAN'S OPINION I DEFY IT
BUT WHAT HAD BEFALLEN THE NIGHT THE MOON WAS NOT YET SET AND WE WERE
ALL IN SHADOW I COULD SCARCELY SEE MY MASTER'S FACE NEAR AS I WAS
AND
WHAT AILED THE CHESTNUT TREE IT WRITHED AND GROANED WHILE WIND ROARED
IN THE LAUREL WALK AND CAME SWEEPING OVER US
WE MUST GO IN SAID MR
ROCHESTER THE WEATHER CHANGES
I COULD HAVE
SAT WITH THEE TILL MORNING JANE
AND SO THOUGHT I COULD I WITH YOU I SHOULD HAVE SAID SO PERHAPS
BUT A LIVID VIVID SPARK LEAPT OUT OF A CLOUD AT WHICH I WAS LOOKING AND
THERE WAS A CRACK A CRASH AND A CLOSE RATTLING PEAL AND I THOUGHT ONLY
OF HIDING MY DAZZLED EYES AGAINST MR
ROCHESTER'S SHOULDER
THE RAIN RUSHED DOWN
HE HURRIED ME UP THE WALK THROUGH THE GROUNDS
AND INTO THE HOUSE BUT WE WERE QUITE WET BEFORE WE COULD PASS THE
THRESHOLD
HE WAS TAKING OFF MY SHAWL IN THE HALL AND SHAKING THE WATER
OUT OF MY LOOSENED HAIR WHEN MRS
FAIRFAX EMERGED FROM HER ROOM
I DID
NOT OBSERVE HER AT FIRST NOR DID MR
ROCHESTER
THE LAMP WAS LIT
THE
CLOCK WAS ON THE STROKE OF TWELVE
HASTEN TO TAKE OFF YOUR WET THINGS SAID HE AND BEFORE YOU GO GOOD
NIGHT GOOD NIGHT MY DARLING
HE KISSED ME REPEATEDLY
WHEN I LOOKED UP ON LEAVING HIS ARMS THERE
STOOD THE WIDOW PALE GRAVE AND AMAZED
I ONLY SMILED AT HER AND RAN
UPSTAIRS
EXPLANATION WILL DO FOR ANOTHER TIME THOUGHT I
STILL
WHEN I REACHED MY CHAMBER I FELT A PANG AT THE IDEA SHE SHOULD EVEN
TEMPORARILY MISCONSTRUE WHAT SHE HAD SEEN
BUT JOY SOON EFFACED EVERY
OTHER FEELING AND LOUD AS THE WIND BLEW NEAR AND DEEP AS THE THUNDER
CRASHED FIERCE AND FREQUENT AS THE LIGHTNING GLEAMED CATARACT LIKE AS
THE RAIN FELL DURING A STORM OF TWO HOURS' DURATION I EXPERIENCED NO
FEAR AND LITTLE AWE
MR
ROCHESTER CAME THRICE TO MY DOOR IN THE COURSE
OF IT TO ASK IF I WAS SAFE AND TRANQUIL AND THAT WAS COMFORT THAT WAS
STRENGTH FOR ANYTHING
BEFORE I LEFT MY BED IN THE MORNING LITTLE ADELE CAME RUNNING IN TO TELL
ME THAT THE GREAT HORSE CHESTNUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ORCHARD HAD BEEN
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING IN THE NIGHT AND HALF OF IT SPLIT AWAY
CHAPTER XXIV
AS I ROSE AND DRESSED I THOUGHT OVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND WONDERED IF
IT WERE A DREAM
I COULD NOT BE CERTAIN OF THE REALITY TILL I HAD SEEN
MR
ROCHESTER AGAIN AND HEARD HIM RENEW HIS WORDS OF LOVE AND PROMISE
WHILE ARRANGING MY HAIR I LOOKED AT MY FACE IN THE GLASS AND FELT IT
WAS NO LONGER PLAIN THERE WAS HOPE IN ITS ASPECT AND LIFE IN ITS COLOUR
AND MY EYES SEEMED AS IF THEY HAD BEHELD THE FOUNT OF FRUITION AND
BORROWED BEAMS FROM THE LUSTROUS RIPPLE
I HAD OFTEN BEEN UNWILLING TO
LOOK AT MY MASTER BECAUSE I FEARED HE COULD NOT BE PLEASED AT MY LOOK
BUT I WAS SURE I MIGHT LIFT MY FACE TO HIS NOW AND NOT COOL HIS
AFFECTION BY ITS EXPRESSION
I TOOK A PLAIN BUT CLEAN AND LIGHT SUMMER
DRESS FROM MY DRAWER AND PUT IT ON IT SEEMED NO ATTIRE HAD EVER SO WELL
BECOME ME BECAUSE NONE HAD I EVER WORN IN SO BLISSFUL A MOOD
I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN I RAN DOWN INTO THE HALL TO SEE THAT A
BRILLIANT JUNE MORNING HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE TEMPEST OF THE NIGHT AND TO
FEEL THROUGH THE OPEN GLASS DOOR THE BREATHING OF A FRESH AND FRAGRANT
BREEZE
NATURE MUST BE GLADSOME WHEN I WAS SO HAPPY
A BEGGAR WOMAN AND
HER LITTLE BOY PALE RAGGED OBJECTS BOTH WERE COMING UP THE WALK AND I
RAN DOWN AND GAVE THEM ALL THE MONEY I HAPPENED TO HAVE IN MY PURSE SOME
THREE OR FOUR SHILLINGS GOOD OR BAD THEY MUST PARTAKE OF MY JUBILEE
THE ROOKS CAWED AND BLITHER BIRDS SANG BUT NOTHING WAS SO MERRY OR SO
MUSICAL AS MY OWN REJOICING HEART
MRS
FAIRFAX SURPRISED ME BY LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW WITH A SAD
COUNTENANCE AND SAYING GRAVELY MISS EYRE WILL YOU COME TO BREAKFAST
DURING THE MEAL SHE WAS QUIET AND COOL BUT I COULD NOT UNDECEIVE HER
THEN
I MUST WAIT FOR MY MASTER TO GIVE EXPLANATIONS AND SO MUST SHE
I
ATE WHAT I COULD AND THEN I HASTENED UPSTAIRS
I MET ADELE LEAVING THE
SCHOOLROOM
WHERE ARE YOU GOING IT IS TIME FOR LESSONS
MR
ROCHESTER HAS SENT ME AWAY TO THE NURSERY
WHERE IS HE
IN THERE POINTING TO THE APARTMENT SHE HAD LEFT AND I WENT IN AND
THERE HE STOOD
COME AND BID ME GOOD MORNING SAID HE
I GLADLY ADVANCED AND IT WAS
NOT MERELY A COLD WORD NOW OR EVEN A SHAKE OF THE HAND THAT I RECEIVED
BUT AN EMBRACE AND A KISS
IT SEEMED NATURAL IT SEEMED GENIAL TO BE SO
WELL LOVED SO CARESSED BY HIM
JANE YOU LOOK BLOOMING AND SMILING AND PRETTY SAID HE TRULY
PRETTY THIS MORNING
IS THIS MY PALE LITTLE ELF IS THIS MY MUSTARD
SEED THIS LITTLE SUNNY FACED GIRL WITH THE DIMPLED CHEEK AND ROSY LIPS
THE SATIN SMOOTH HAZEL HAIR AND THE RADIANT HAZEL EYES I HAD GREEN
EYES READER BUT YOU MUST EXCUSE THE MISTAKE FOR HIM THEY WERE
NEW DYED I SUPPOSE
IT IS JANE EYRE SIR
SOON TO BE JANE ROCHESTER HE ADDED IN FOUR WEEKS JANET NOT A DAY
MORE
DO YOU HEAR THAT
I DID AND I COULD NOT QUITE COMPREHEND IT IT MADE ME GIDDY
THE
FEELING THE ANNOUNCEMENT SENT THROUGH ME WAS SOMETHING STRONGER THAN
WAS CONSISTENT WITH JOY SOMETHING THAT SMOTE AND STUNNED
IT WAS I
THINK ALMOST FEAR
YOU BLUSHED AND NOW YOU ARE WHITE JANE WHAT IS THAT FOR
BECAUSE YOU GAVE ME A NEW NAME JANE ROCHESTER AND IT SEEMS SO
STRANGE
YES MRS
ROCHESTER SAID HE YOUNG MRS
ROCHESTER FAIRFAX
ROCHESTER'S GIRL BRIDE
IT CAN NEVER BE SIR IT DOES NOT SOUND LIKELY
HUMAN BEINGS NEVER
ENJOY COMPLETE HAPPINESS IN THIS WORLD
I WAS NOT BORN FOR A DIFFERENT
DESTINY TO THE REST OF MY SPECIES TO IMAGINE SUCH A LOT BEFALLING ME IS
A FAIRY TALE A DAY DREAM
WHICH I CAN AND WILL REALISE
I SHALL BEGIN TO DAY
THIS MORNING I
WROTE TO MY BANKER IN LONDON TO SEND ME CERTAIN JEWELS HE HAS IN HIS
KEEPING HEIRLOOMS FOR THE LADIES OF THORNFIELD
IN A DAY OR TWO I HOPE
TO POUR THEM INTO YOUR LAP FOR EVERY PRIVILEGE EVERY ATTENTION SHALL BE
YOURS THAT I WOULD ACCORD A PEER'S DAUGHTER IF ABOUT TO MARRY HER
OH SIR NEVER RAIN JEWELS I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR THEM SPOKEN OF
JEWELS FOR JANE EYRE SOUNDS UNNATURAL AND STRANGE I WOULD RATHER NOT
HAVE THEM
I WILL MYSELF PUT THE DIAMOND CHAIN ROUND YOUR NECK AND THE CIRCLET ON
YOUR FOREHEAD WHICH IT WILL BECOME FOR NATURE AT LEAST HAS STAMPED
HER PATENT OF NOBILITY ON THIS BROW JANE AND I WILL CLASP THE BRACELETS
ON THESE FINE WRISTS AND LOAD THESE FAIRY LIKE FINGERS WITH RINGS
NO NO SIR THINK OF OTHER SUBJECTS AND SPEAK OF OTHER THINGS AND IN
ANOTHER STRAIN
DON'T ADDRESS ME AS IF I WERE A BEAUTY I AM YOUR PLAIN
QUAKERISH GOVERNESS
YOU ARE A BEAUTY IN MY EYES AND A BEAUTY JUST AFTER THE DESIRE OF MY
HEART DELICATE AND AERIAL
PUNY AND INSIGNIFICANT YOU MEAN
YOU ARE DREAMING SIR OR YOU ARE
SNEERING
FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T BE IRONICAL
I WILL MAKE THE WORLD ACKNOWLEDGE YOU A BEAUTY TOO HE WENT ON WHILE
I REALLY BECAME UNEASY AT THE STRAIN HE HAD ADOPTED BECAUSE I FELT HE
WAS EITHER DELUDING HIMSELF OR TRYING TO DELUDE ME
I WILL ATTIRE MY
JANE IN SATIN AND LACE AND SHE SHALL HAVE ROSES IN HER HAIR AND I WILL
COVER THE HEAD I LOVE BEST WITH A PRICELESS VEIL
AND THEN YOU WON'T KNOW ME SIR AND I SHALL NOT BE YOUR JANE EYRE ANY
LONGER BUT AN APE IN A HARLEQUIN'S JACKET A JAY IN BORROWED PLUMES
I
WOULD AS SOON SEE YOU MR
ROCHESTER TRICKED OUT IN STAGE TRAPPINGS AS
MYSELF CLAD IN A COURT LADY'S ROBE AND I DON'T CALL YOU HANDSOME SIR
THOUGH I LOVE YOU MOST DEARLY FAR TOO DEARLY TO FLATTER YOU
DON'T
FLATTER ME
HE PURSUED HIS THEME HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING MY DEPRECATION
THIS
VERY DAY I SHALL TAKE YOU IN THE CARRIAGE TO MILLCOTE AND YOU MUST
CHOOSE SOME DRESSES FOR YOURSELF
I TOLD YOU WE SHALL BE MARRIED IN FOUR
WEEKS
THE WEDDING IS TO TAKE PLACE QUIETLY IN THE CHURCH DOWN BELOW
YONDER AND THEN I SHALL WAFT YOU AWAY AT ONCE TO TOWN
AFTER A BRIEF
STAY THERE I SHALL BEAR MY TREASURE TO REGIONS NEARER THE SUN TO FRENCH
VINEYARDS AND ITALIAN PLAINS AND SHE SHALL SEE WHATEVER IS FAMOUS IN OLD
STORY AND IN MODERN RECORD SHE SHALL TASTE TOO OF THE LIFE OF CITIES
AND SHE SHALL LEARN TO VALUE HERSELF BY JUST COMPARISON WITH OTHERS
SHALL I TRAVEL AND WITH YOU SIR
YOU SHALL SOJOURN AT PARIS ROME AND NAPLES AT FLORENCE VENICE AND
VIENNA ALL THE GROUND I HAVE WANDERED OVER SHALL BE RE TRODDEN BY YOU
WHEREVER I STAMPED MY HOOF YOUR SYLPH'S FOOT SHALL STEP ALSO
TEN YEARS
SINCE I FLEW THROUGH EUROPE HALF MAD WITH DISGUST HATE AND RAGE AS MY
COMPANIONS NOW I SHALL REVISIT IT HEALED AND CLEANSED WITH A VERY ANGEL
AS MY COMFORTER
I LAUGHED AT HIM AS HE SAID THIS
I AM NOT AN ANGEL I ASSERTED AND
I WILL NOT BE ONE TILL I DIE I WILL BE MYSELF
MR
ROCHESTER YOU MUST
NEITHER EXPECT NOR EXACT ANYTHING CELESTIAL OF ME FOR YOU WILL NOT GET
IT ANY MORE THAN I SHALL GET IT OF YOU WHICH I DO NOT AT ALL
ANTICIPATE
WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE OF ME
FOR A LITTLE WHILE YOU WILL PERHAPS BE AS YOU ARE NOW A VERY LITTLE
WHILE AND THEN YOU WILL TURN COOL AND THEN YOU WILL BE CAPRICIOUS AND
THEN YOU WILL BE STERN AND I SHALL HAVE MUCH ADO TO PLEASE YOU BUT WHEN
YOU GET WELL USED TO ME YOU WILL PERHAPS LIKE ME AGAIN LIKE ME I
SAY NOT LOVE ME
I SUPPOSE YOUR LOVE WILL EFFERVESCE IN SIX MONTHS
OR LESS
I HAVE OBSERVED IN BOOKS WRITTEN BY MEN THAT PERIOD ASSIGNED
AS THE FARTHEST TO WHICH A HUSBAND'S ARDOUR EXTENDS
YET AFTER ALL AS
A FRIEND AND COMPANION I HOPE NEVER TO BECOME QUITE DISTASTEFUL TO MY
DEAR MASTER
DISTASTEFUL AND LIKE YOU AGAIN I THINK I SHALL LIKE YOU AGAIN AND
YET AGAIN AND I WILL MAKE YOU CONFESS I DO NOT ONLY LIKE BUT LOVE
YOU WITH TRUTH FERVOUR CONSTANCY
YET ARE YOU NOT CAPRICIOUS SIR
TO WOMEN WHO PLEASE ME ONLY BY THEIR FACES I AM THE VERY DEVIL WHEN I
FIND OUT THEY HAVE NEITHER SOULS NOR HEARTS WHEN THEY OPEN TO ME A
PERSPECTIVE OF FLATNESS TRIVIALITY AND PERHAPS IMBECILITY COARSENESS
AND ILL TEMPER BUT TO THE CLEAR EYE AND ELOQUENT TONGUE TO THE SOUL
MADE OF FIRE AND THE CHARACTER THAT BENDS BUT DOES NOT BREAK AT ONCE
SUPPLE AND STABLE TRACTABLE AND CONSISTENT I AM EVER TENDER AND TRUE
HAD YOU EVER EXPERIENCE OF SUCH A CHARACTER SIR DID YOU EVER LOVE
SUCH AN ONE
I LOVE IT NOW
BUT BEFORE ME IF I INDEED IN ANY RESPECT COME UP TO YOUR DIFFICULT
STANDARD
I NEVER MET YOUR LIKENESS
JANE YOU PLEASE ME AND YOU MASTER ME YOU
SEEM TO SUBMIT AND I LIKE THE SENSE OF PLIANCY YOU IMPART AND WHILE I
AM TWINING THE SOFT SILKEN SKEIN ROUND MY FINGER IT SENDS A THRILL UP
MY ARM TO MY HEART
I AM INFLUENCED CONQUERED AND THE INFLUENCE IS
SWEETER THAN I CAN EXPRESS AND THE CONQUEST I UNDERGO HAS A WITCHERY
BEYOND ANY TRIUMPH I CAN WIN
WHY DO YOU SMILE JANE WHAT DOES THAT
INEXPLICABLE THAT UNCANNY TURN OF COUNTENANCE MEAN
I WAS THINKING SIR YOU WILL EXCUSE THE IDEA IT WAS INVOLUNTARY I
WAS THINKING OF HERCULES AND SAMSON WITH THEIR CHARMERS
YOU WERE YOU LITTLE ELFISH
HUSH SIR YOU DON'T TALK VERY WISELY JUST NOW ANY MORE THAN THOSE
GENTLEMEN ACTED VERY WISELY
HOWEVER HAD THEY BEEN MARRIED THEY WOULD
NO DOUBT BY THEIR SEVERITY AS HUSBANDS HAVE MADE UP FOR THEIR SOFTNESS AS
SUITORS AND SO WILL YOU I FEAR
I WONDER HOW YOU WILL ANSWER ME A YEAR
HENCE SHOULD I ASK A FAVOUR IT DOES NOT SUIT YOUR CONVENIENCE OR
PLEASURE TO GRANT
ASK ME SOMETHING NOW JANE THE LEAST THING I DESIRE TO BE ENTREATED
INDEED I WILL SIR I HAVE MY PETITION ALL READY
SPEAK BUT IF YOU LOOK UP AND SMILE WITH THAT COUNTENANCE I SHALL
SWEAR CONCESSION BEFORE I KNOW TO WHAT AND THAT WILL MAKE A FOOL OF ME
NOT AT ALL SIR I ASK ONLY THIS DON'T SEND FOR THE JEWELS AND DON'T
CROWN ME WITH ROSES YOU MIGHT AS WELL PUT A BORDER OF GOLD LACE ROUND
THAT PLAIN POCKET HANDKERCHIEF YOU HAVE THERE
I MIGHT AS WELL 'GILD REFINED GOLD I KNOW IT YOUR REQUEST IS GRANTED
THEN FOR THE TIME
I WILL REMAND THE ORDER I DESPATCHED TO MY BANKER
BUT YOU HAVE NOT YET ASKED FOR ANYTHING YOU HAVE PRAYED A GIFT TO BE
WITHDRAWN TRY AGAIN
WELL THEN SIR HAVE THE GOODNESS TO GRATIFY MY CURIOSITY WHICH IS MUCH
PIQUED ON ONE POINT
HE LOOKED DISTURBED
WHAT WHAT HE SAID HASTILY
CURIOSITY IS A
DANGEROUS PETITION IT IS WELL I HAVE NOT TAKEN A VOW TO ACCORD EVERY
REQUEST
BUT THERE CAN BE NO DANGER IN COMPLYING WITH THIS SIR
UTTER IT JANE BUT I WISH THAT INSTEAD OF A MERE INQUIRY INTO PERHAPS
A SECRET IT WAS A WISH FOR HALF MY ESTATE
NOW KING AHASUERUS WHAT DO I WANT WITH HALF YOUR ESTATE DO YOU
THINK I AM A JEW USURER SEEKING GOOD INVESTMENT IN LAND I WOULD MUCH
RATHER HAVE ALL YOUR CONFIDENCE
YOU WILL NOT EXCLUDE ME FROM YOUR
CONFIDENCE IF YOU ADMIT ME TO YOUR HEART
YOU ARE WELCOME TO ALL MY CONFIDENCE THAT IS WORTH HAVING JANE BUT FOR
GOD'S SAKE DON'T DESIRE A USELESS BURDEN DON'T LONG FOR POISON DON'T
TURN OUT A DOWNRIGHT EVE ON MY HANDS
WHY NOT SIR YOU HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING ME HOW MUCH YOU LIKED TO BE
CONQUERED AND HOW PLEASANT OVER PERSUASION IS TO YOU
DON'T YOU THINK I
HAD BETTER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONFESSION AND BEGIN AND COAX AND
ENTREAT EVEN CRY AND BE SULKY IF NECESSARY FOR THE SAKE OF A MERE ESSAY
OF MY POWER
I DARE YOU TO ANY SUCH EXPERIMENT
ENCROACH PRESUME AND THE GAME IS
UP
IS IT SIR YOU SOON GIVE IN
HOW STERN YOU LOOK NOW YOUR EYEBROWS
HAVE BECOME AS THICK AS MY FINGER AND YOUR FOREHEAD RESEMBLES WHAT IN
SOME VERY ASTONISHING POETRY I ONCE SAW STYLED 'A BLUE PILED
THUNDERLOFT THAT WILL BE YOUR MARRIED LOOK SIR I SUPPOSE
IF THAT WILL BE YOUR MARRIED LOOK I AS A CHRISTIAN WILL SOON GIVE
UP THE NOTION OF CONSORTING WITH A MERE SPRITE OR SALAMANDER
BUT WHAT
HAD YOU TO ASK THING OUT WITH IT
THERE YOU ARE LESS THAN CIVIL NOW AND I LIKE RUDENESS A GREAT DEAL
BETTER THAN FLATTERY
I HAD RATHER BE A THING THAN AN ANGEL
THIS IS
WHAT I HAVE TO ASK WHY DID YOU TAKE SUCH PAINS TO MAKE ME BELIEVE YOU
WISHED TO MARRY MISS INGRAM
IS THAT ALL THANK GOD IT IS NO WORSE AND NOW HE UNKNIT HIS BLACK
BROWS LOOKED DOWN SMILING AT ME AND STROKED MY HAIR AS IF WELL
PLEASED AT SEEING A DANGER AVERTED
I THINK I MAY CONFESS HE
CONTINUED EVEN ALTHOUGH I SHOULD MAKE YOU A LITTLE INDIGNANT JANE AND
I HAVE SEEN WHAT A FIRE SPIRIT YOU CAN BE WHEN YOU ARE INDIGNANT
YOU
GLOWED IN THE COOL MOONLIGHT LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU MUTINIED AGAINST FATE
AND CLAIMED YOUR RANK AS MY EQUAL
JANET BY THE BYE IT WAS YOU WHO
MADE ME THE OFFER
OF COURSE I DID
BUT TO THE POINT IF YOU PLEASE SIR MISS INGRAM
WELL I FEIGNED COURTSHIP OF MISS INGRAM BECAUSE I WISHED TO RENDER YOU
AS MADLY IN LOVE WITH ME AS I WAS WITH YOU AND I KNEW JEALOUSY WOULD BE
THE BEST ALLY I COULD CALL IN FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF THAT END
EXCELLENT NOW YOU ARE SMALL NOT ONE WHIT BIGGER THAN THE END OF MY
LITTLE FINGER
IT WAS A BURNING SHAME AND A SCANDALOUS DISGRACE TO ACT
IN THAT WAY
DID YOU THINK NOTHING OF MISS INGRAM'S FEELINGS SIR
HER FEELINGS ARE CONCENTRATED IN ONE PRIDE AND THAT NEEDS HUMBLING
WERE YOU JEALOUS JANE
NEVER MIND MR
ROCHESTER IT IS IN NO WAY INTERESTING TO YOU TO KNOW
THAT
ANSWER ME TRULY ONCE MORE
DO YOU THINK MISS INGRAM WILL NOT
SUFFER FROM YOUR DISHONEST COQUETRY WON'T SHE FEEL FORSAKEN AND
DESERTED
IMPOSSIBLE WHEN I TOLD YOU HOW SHE ON THE CONTRARY DESERTED ME THE
IDEA OF MY INSOLVENCY COOLED OR RATHER EXTINGUISHED HER FLAME IN A
MOMENT
YOU HAVE A CURIOUS DESIGNING MIND MR
ROCHESTER
I AM AFRAID YOUR
PRINCIPLES ON SOME POINTS ARE ECCENTRIC
MY PRINCIPLES WERE NEVER TRAINED JANE THEY MAY HAVE GROWN A LITTLE
AWRY FOR WANT OF ATTENTION
ONCE AGAIN SERIOUSLY MAY I ENJOY THE GREAT GOOD THAT HAS BEEN
VOUCHSAFED TO ME WITHOUT FEARING THAT ANY ONE ELSE IS SUFFERING THE
BITTER PAIN I MYSELF FELT A WHILE AGO
THAT YOU MAY MY GOOD LITTLE GIRL THERE IS NOT ANOTHER BEING IN THE
WORLD HAS THE SAME PURE LOVE FOR ME AS YOURSELF FOR I LAY THAT PLEASANT
UNCTION TO MY SOUL JANE A BELIEF IN YOUR AFFECTION
I TURNED MY LIPS TO THE HAND THAT LAY ON MY SHOULDER
I LOVED HIM VERY
MUCH MORE THAN I COULD TRUST MYSELF TO SAY MORE THAN WORDS HAD POWER TO
EXPRESS
ASK SOMETHING MORE HE SAID PRESENTLY IT IS MY DELIGHT TO BE
ENTREATED AND TO YIELD
I WAS AGAIN READY WITH MY REQUEST
COMMUNICATE YOUR INTENTIONS TO MRS
FAIRFAX SIR SHE SAW ME WITH YOU LAST NIGHT IN THE HALL AND SHE WAS
SHOCKED
GIVE HER SOME EXPLANATION BEFORE I SEE HER AGAIN
IT PAINS ME
TO BE MISJUDGED BY SO GOOD A WOMAN
GO TO YOUR ROOM AND PUT ON YOUR BONNET HE REPLIED
I MEAN YOU TO
ACCOMPANY ME TO MILLCOTE THIS MORNING AND WHILE YOU PREPARE FOR THE
DRIVE I WILL ENLIGHTEN THE OLD LADY'S UNDERSTANDING
DID SHE THINK
JANET YOU HAD GIVEN THE WORLD FOR LOVE AND CONSIDERED IT WELL LOST
I BELIEVE SHE THOUGHT I HAD FORGOTTEN MY STATION AND YOURS SIR
STATION STATION YOUR STATION IS IN MY HEART AND ON THE NECKS OF
THOSE WHO WOULD INSULT YOU NOW OR HEREAFTER GO
I WAS SOON DRESSED AND WHEN I HEARD MR
ROCHESTER QUIT MRS
FAIRFAX'S
PARLOUR I HURRIED DOWN TO IT
THE OLD LADY HAD BEEN READING HER
MORNING PORTION OF SCRIPTURE THE LESSON FOR THE DAY HER BIBLE LAY OPEN
BEFORE HER AND HER SPECTACLES WERE UPON IT
HER OCCUPATION SUSPENDED
BY MR
ROCHESTER'S ANNOUNCEMENT SEEMED NOW FORGOTTEN HER EYES FIXED ON
THE BLANK WALL OPPOSITE EXPRESSED THE SURPRISE OF A QUIET MIND STIRRED
BY UNWONTED TIDINGS
SEEING ME SHE ROUSED HERSELF SHE MADE A SORT OF
EFFORT TO SMILE AND FRAMED A FEW WORDS OF CONGRATULATION BUT THE SMILE
EXPIRED AND THE SENTENCE WAS ABANDONED UNFINISHED
SHE PUT UP HER
SPECTACLES SHUT THE BIBLE AND PUSHED HER CHAIR BACK FROM THE TABLE
I FEEL SO ASTONISHED SHE BEGAN I HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU
MISS EYRE
I HAVE SURELY NOT BEEN DREAMING HAVE I SOMETIMES I HALF
FALL ASLEEP WHEN I AM SITTING ALONE AND FANCY THINGS THAT HAVE NEVER
HAPPENED
IT HAS SEEMED TO ME MORE THAN ONCE WHEN I HAVE BEEN IN A DOZE
THAT MY DEAR HUSBAND WHO DIED FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE HAS COME IN AND SAT
DOWN BESIDE ME AND THAT I HAVE EVEN HEARD HIM CALL ME BY MY NAME ALICE
AS HE USED TO DO
NOW CAN YOU TELL ME WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY TRUE THAT
MR
ROCHESTER HAS ASKED YOU TO MARRY HIM DON'T LAUGH AT ME
BUT I
REALLY THOUGHT HE CAME IN HERE FIVE MINUTES AGO AND SAID THAT IN A MONTH
YOU WOULD BE HIS WIFE
HE HAS SAID THE SAME THING TO ME I REPLIED
HE HAS DO YOU BELIEVE HIM HAVE YOU ACCEPTED HIM
YES
SHE LOOKED AT ME BEWILDERED
I COULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT IT
HE IS A
PROUD MAN ALL THE ROCHESTERS WERE PROUD AND HIS FATHER AT LEAST LIKED
MONEY
HE TOO HAS ALWAYS BEEN CALLED CAREFUL
HE MEANS TO MARRY YOU
HE TELLS ME SO
SHE SURVEYED MY WHOLE PERSON IN HER EYES I READ THAT THEY HAD THERE
FOUND NO CHARM POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE ENIGMA
IT PASSES ME SHE CONTINUED BUT NO DOUBT IT IS TRUE SINCE YOU SAY
SO
HOW IT WILL ANSWER I CANNOT TELL I REALLY DON'T KNOW
EQUALITY OF
POSITION AND FORTUNE IS OFTEN ADVISABLE IN SUCH CASES AND THERE ARE
TWENTY YEARS OF DIFFERENCE IN YOUR AGES
HE MIGHT ALMOST BE YOUR
FATHER
NO INDEED MRS
FAIRFAX EXCLAIMED I NETTLED HE IS NOTHING LIKE MY
FATHER NO ONE WHO SAW US TOGETHER WOULD SUPPOSE IT FOR AN INSTANT
MR
ROCHESTER LOOKS AS YOUNG AND IS AS YOUNG AS SOME MEN AT FIVE AND
TWENTY
IS IT REALLY FOR LOVE HE IS GOING TO MARRY YOU SHE ASKED
I WAS SO HURT BY HER COLDNESS AND SCEPTICISM THAT THE TEARS ROSE TO MY
EYES
I AM SORRY TO GRIEVE YOU PURSUED THE WIDOW BUT YOU ARE SO YOUNG AND
SO LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH MEN I WISHED TO PUT YOU ON YOUR GUARD
IT IS
AN OLD SAYING THAT 'ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS AND IN THIS CASE I DO
FEAR THERE WILL BE SOMETHING FOUND TO BE DIFFERENT TO WHAT EITHER YOU OR
I EXPECT
WHY AM I A MONSTER I SAID IS IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT MR
ROCHESTER
SHOULD HAVE A SINCERE AFFECTION FOR ME
NO YOU ARE VERY WELL AND MUCH IMPROVED OF LATE AND MR
ROCHESTER I
DARESAY IS FOND OF YOU
I HAVE ALWAYS NOTICED THAT YOU WERE A SORT OF
PET OF HIS
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN FOR YOUR SAKE I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE
UNEASY AT HIS MARKED PREFERENCE AND HAVE WISHED TO PUT YOU ON YOUR
GUARD BUT I DID NOT LIKE TO SUGGEST EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF WRONG
I
KNEW SUCH AN IDEA WOULD SHOCK PERHAPS OFFEND YOU AND YOU WERE SO
DISCREET AND SO THOROUGHLY MODEST AND SENSIBLE I HOPED YOU MIGHT BE
TRUSTED TO PROTECT YOURSELF
LAST NIGHT I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT I
SUFFERED WHEN I SOUGHT ALL OVER THE HOUSE AND COULD FIND YOU NOWHERE
NOR THE MASTER EITHER AND THEN AT TWELVE O'CLOCK SAW YOU COME IN WITH
HIM
WELL NEVER MIND THAT NOW I INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY IT IS ENOUGH
THAT ALL WAS RIGHT
I HOPE ALL WILL BE RIGHT IN THE END SHE SAID BUT BELIEVE ME YOU
CANNOT BE TOO CAREFUL
TRY AND KEEP MR
ROCHESTER AT A DISTANCE
DISTRUST YOURSELF AS WELL AS HIM
GENTLEMEN IN HIS STATION ARE NOT
ACCUSTOMED TO MARRY THEIR GOVERNESSES
I WAS GROWING TRULY IRRITATED HAPPILY ADELE RAN IN
LET ME GO LET ME GO TO MILLCOTE TOO SHE CRIED
MR
ROCHESTER
WON'T THOUGH THERE IS SO MUCH ROOM IN THE NEW CARRIAGE
BEG HIM TO LET
ME GO MADEMOISELLE
THAT I WILL ADELE AND I HASTENED AWAY WITH HER GLAD TO QUIT MY
GLOOMY MONITRESS
THE CARRIAGE WAS READY THEY WERE BRINGING IT ROUND TO
THE FRONT AND MY MASTER WAS PACING THE PAVEMENT PILOT FOLLOWING HIM
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
ADELE MAY ACCOMPANY US MAY SHE NOT SIR
I TOLD HER NO
I'LL HAVE NO BRATS I'LL HAVE ONLY YOU
DO LET HER GO MR
ROCHESTER IF YOU PLEASE IT WOULD BE BETTER
NOT IT SHE WILL BE A RESTRAINT
HE WAS QUITE PEREMPTORY BOTH IN LOOK AND VOICE
THE CHILL OF MRS
FAIRFAX'S WARNINGS AND THE DAMP OF HER DOUBTS WERE UPON ME SOMETHING OF
UNSUBSTANTIALITY AND UNCERTAINTY HAD BESET MY HOPES
I HALF LOST THE
SENSE OF POWER OVER HIM
I WAS ABOUT MECHANICALLY TO OBEY HIM WITHOUT
FURTHER REMONSTRANCE BUT AS HE HELPED ME INTO THE CARRIAGE HE LOOKED AT
MY FACE
WHAT IS THE MATTER HE ASKED ALL THE SUNSHINE IS GONE
DO YOU REALLY
WISH THE BAIRN TO GO WILL IT ANNOY YOU IF SHE IS LEFT BEHIND
I WOULD FAR RATHER SHE WENT SIR
THEN OFF FOR YOUR BONNET AND BACK LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING CRIED HE
TO ADELE
SHE OBEYED HIM WITH WHAT SPEED SHE MIGHT
AFTER ALL A SINGLE MORNING'S INTERRUPTION WILL NOT MATTER MUCH SAID
HE WHEN I MEAN SHORTLY TO CLAIM YOU YOUR THOUGHTS CONVERSATION AND
COMPANY FOR LIFE
ADELE WHEN LIFTED IN COMMENCED KISSING ME BY WAY OF EXPRESSING HER
GRATITUDE FOR MY INTERCESSION SHE WAS INSTANTLY STOWED AWAY INTO A
CORNER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIM
SHE THEN PEEPED ROUND TO WHERE I SAT
SO STERN A NEIGHBOUR WAS TOO RESTRICTIVE TO HIM IN HIS PRESENT FRACTIOUS
MOOD SHE DARED WHISPER NO OBSERVATIONS NOR ASK OF HIM ANY INFORMATION
LET HER COME TO ME I ENTREATED SHE WILL PERHAPS TROUBLE YOU SIR
THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM ON THIS SIDE
HE HANDED HER OVER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A LAPDOG
I'LL SEND HER TO SCHOOL
YET HE SAID BUT NOW HE WAS SMILING
ADELE HEARD HIM AND ASKED IF SHE WAS TO GO TO SCHOOL SANS
MADEMOISELLE
YES HE REPLIED ABSOLUTELY SANS MADEMOISELLE FOR I AM TO TAKE
MADEMOISELLE TO THE MOON AND THERE I SHALL SEEK A CAVE IN ONE OF THE
WHITE VALLEYS AMONG THE VOLCANO TOPS AND MADEMOISELLE SHALL LIVE WITH ME
THERE AND ONLY ME
SHE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO EAT YOU WILL STARVE HER OBSERVED ADELE
I SHALL GATHER MANNA FOR HER MORNING AND NIGHT THE PLAINS AND HILLSIDES
IN THE MOON ARE BLEACHED WITH MANNA ADELE
SHE WILL WANT TO WARM HERSELF WHAT WILL SHE DO FOR A FIRE
FIRE RISES OUT OF THE LUNAR MOUNTAINS WHEN SHE IS COLD I'LL CARRY HER
UP TO A PEAK AND LAY HER DOWN ON THE EDGE OF A CRATER
OH QU' ELLE Y SERA MAL PEU COMFORTABLE AND HER CLOTHES THEY WILL
WEAR OUT HOW CAN SHE GET NEW ONES
MR
ROCHESTER PROFESSED TO BE PUZZLED
HEM SAID HE
WHAT WOULD YOU
DO ADELE CUDGEL YOUR BRAINS FOR AN EXPEDIENT
HOW WOULD A WHITE OR A
PINK CLOUD ANSWER FOR A GOWN DO YOU THINK AND ONE COULD CUT A PRETTY
ENOUGH SCARF OUT OF A RAINBOW
SHE IS FAR BETTER AS SHE IS CONCLUDED ADELE AFTER MUSING SOME TIME
BESIDES SHE WOULD GET TIRED OF LIVING WITH ONLY YOU IN THE MOON
IF I
WERE MADEMOISELLE I WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO GO WITH YOU
SHE HAS CONSENTED SHE HAS PLEDGED HER WORD
BUT YOU CAN'T GET HER THERE THERE IS NO ROAD TO THE MOON IT IS ALL
AIR AND NEITHER YOU NOR SHE CAN FLY
ADELE LOOK AT THAT FIELD WE WERE NOW OUTSIDE THORNFIELD GATES AND
BOWLING LIGHTLY ALONG THE SMOOTH ROAD TO MILLCOTE WHERE THE DUST WAS
WELL LAID BY THE THUNDERSTORM AND WHERE THE LOW HEDGES AND LOFTY TIMBER
TREES ON EACH SIDE GLISTENED GREEN AND RAIN REFRESHED
IN THAT FIELD ADELE I WAS WALKING LATE ONE EVENING ABOUT A FORTNIGHT
SINCE THE EVENING OF THE DAY YOU HELPED ME TO MAKE HAY IN THE ORCHARD
MEADOWS AND AS I WAS TIRED WITH RAKING SWATHS I SAT DOWN TO REST ME ON
A STILE AND THERE I TOOK OUT A LITTLE BOOK AND A PENCIL AND BEGAN TO
WRITE ABOUT A MISFORTUNE THAT BEFELL ME LONG AGO AND A WISH I HAD FOR
HAPPY DAYS TO COME I WAS WRITING AWAY VERY FAST THOUGH DAYLIGHT WAS
FADING FROM THE LEAF WHEN SOMETHING CAME UP THE PATH AND STOPPED TWO
YARDS OFF ME
I LOOKED AT IT
IT WAS A LITTLE THING WITH A VEIL OF
GOSSAMER ON ITS HEAD
I BECKONED IT TO COME NEAR ME IT STOOD SOON AT MY
KNEE
I NEVER SPOKE TO IT AND IT NEVER SPOKE TO ME IN WORDS BUT I
READ ITS EYES AND IT READ MINE AND OUR SPEECHLESS COLLOQUY WAS TO THIS
EFFECT
IT WAS A FAIRY AND COME FROM ELF LAND IT SAID AND ITS ERRAND WAS TO
MAKE ME HAPPY I MUST GO WITH IT OUT OF THE COMMON WORLD TO A LONELY
PLACE SUCH AS THE MOON FOR INSTANCE AND IT NODDED ITS HEAD TOWARDS HER
HORN RISING OVER HAY HILL IT TOLD ME OF THE ALABASTER CAVE AND SILVER
VALE WHERE WE MIGHT LIVE
I SAID I SHOULD LIKE TO GO BUT REMINDED IT
AS YOU DID ME THAT I HAD NO WINGS TO FLY
'OH RETURNED THE FAIRY 'THAT DOES NOT SIGNIFY HERE IS A TALISMAN
WILL REMOVE ALL DIFFICULTIES AND SHE HELD OUT A PRETTY GOLD RING
'PUT
IT SHE SAID 'ON THE FOURTH FINGER OF MY LEFT HAND AND I AM YOURS AND
YOU ARE MINE AND WE SHALL LEAVE EARTH AND MAKE OUR OWN HEAVEN YONDER
SHE NODDED AGAIN AT THE MOON
THE RING ADELE IS IN MY BREECHES POCKET
UNDER THE DISGUISE OF A SOVEREIGN BUT I MEAN SOON TO CHANGE IT TO A RING
AGAIN
BUT WHAT HAS MADEMOISELLE TO DO WITH IT I DON'T CARE FOR THE FAIRY
YOU SAID IT WAS MADEMOISELLE YOU WOULD TAKE TO THE MOON
MADEMOISELLE IS A FAIRY HE SAID WHISPERING MYSTERIOUSLY
WHEREUPON I
TOLD HER NOT TO MIND HIS BADINAGE AND SHE ON HER PART EVINCED A FUND
OF GENUINE FRENCH SCEPTICISM DENOMINATING MR
ROCHESTER UN VRAI
MENTEUR AND ASSURING HIM THAT SHE MADE NO ACCOUNT WHATEVER OF HIS
CONTES DE FEE AND THAT DU RESTE IL N'Y AVAIT PAS DE FEES ET QUAND
MEME IL Y EN AVAIT SHE WAS SURE THEY WOULD NEVER APPEAR TO HIM NOR
EVER GIVE HIM RINGS OR OFFER TO LIVE WITH HIM IN THE MOON
THE HOUR SPENT AT MILLCOTE WAS A SOMEWHAT HARASSING ONE TO ME
MR
ROCHESTER OBLIGED ME TO GO TO A CERTAIN SILK WAREHOUSE THERE I WAS
ORDERED TO CHOOSE HALF A DOZEN DRESSES
I HATED THE BUSINESS I BEGGED
LEAVE TO DEFER IT NO IT SHOULD BE GONE THROUGH WITH NOW
BY DINT OF
ENTREATIES EXPRESSED IN ENERGETIC WHISPERS I REDUCED THE HALF DOZEN TO
TWO THESE HOWEVER HE VOWED HE WOULD SELECT HIMSELF
WITH ANXIETY I
WATCHED HIS EYE ROVE OVER THE GAY STORES HE FIXED ON A RICH SILK OF THE
MOST BRILLIANT AMETHYST DYE AND A SUPERB PINK SATIN
I TOLD HIM IN A
NEW SERIES OF WHISPERS THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL BUY ME A GOLD GOWN AND A
SILVER BONNET AT ONCE I SHOULD CERTAINLY NEVER VENTURE TO WEAR HIS
CHOICE
WITH INFINITE DIFFICULTY FOR HE WAS STUBBORN AS A STONE I
PERSUADED HIM TO MAKE AN EXCHANGE IN FAVOUR OF A SOBER BLACK SATIN AND
PEARL GREY SILK
IT MIGHT PASS FOR THE PRESENT HE SAID BUT HE WOULD
YET SEE ME GLITTERING LIKE A PARTERRE
GLAD WAS I TO GET HIM OUT OF THE SILK WAREHOUSE AND THEN OUT OF A
JEWELLERS SHOP THE MORE HE BOUGHT ME THE MORE MY CHEEK BURNED WITH A
SENSE OF ANNOYANCE AND DEGRADATION
AS WE RE ENTERED THE CARRIAGE AND I
SAT BACK FEVERISH AND FAGGED I REMEMBERED WHAT IN THE HURRY OF EVENTS
DARK AND BRIGHT I HAD WHOLLY FORGOTTEN THE LETTER OF MY UNCLE JOHN
EYRE TO MRS
REED HIS INTENTION TO ADOPT ME AND MAKE ME HIS LEGATEE
IT WOULD INDEED BE A RELIEF I THOUGHT IF I HAD EVER SO SMALL AN
INDEPENDENCY I NEVER CAN BEAR BEING DRESSED LIKE A DOLL BY MR
ROCHESTER OR SITTING LIKE A SECOND DANAE WITH THE GOLDEN SHOWER FALLING
DAILY ROUND ME
I WILL WRITE TO MADEIRA THE MOMENT I GET HOME AND TELL
MY UNCLE JOHN I AM GOING TO BE MARRIED AND TO WHOM IF I HAD BUT A
PROSPECT OF ONE DAY BRINGING MR
ROCHESTER AN ACCESSION OF FORTUNE I
COULD BETTER ENDURE TO BE KEPT BY HIM NOW AND SOMEWHAT RELIEVED BY
THIS IDEA WHICH I FAILED NOT TO EXECUTE THAT DAY I VENTURED ONCE MORE
TO MEET MY MASTER'S AND LOVER'S EYE WHICH MOST PERTINACIOUSLY SOUGHT
MINE THOUGH I AVERTED BOTH FACE AND GAZE
HE SMILED AND I THOUGHT HIS
SMILE WAS SUCH AS A SULTAN MIGHT IN A BLISSFUL AND FOND MOMENT BESTOW
ON A SLAVE HIS GOLD AND GEMS HAD ENRICHED I CRUSHED HIS HAND WHICH WAS
EVER HUNTING MINE VIGOROUSLY AND THRUST IT BACK TO HIM RED WITH THE
PASSIONATE PRESSURE
YOU NEED NOT LOOK IN THAT WAY I SAID IF YOU DO I'LL WEAR NOTHING
BUT MY OLD LOWOOD FROCKS TO THE END OF THE CHAPTER
I'LL BE MARRIED IN
THIS LILAC GINGHAM YOU MAY MAKE A DRESSING GOWN FOR YOURSELF OUT OF THE
PEARL GREY SILK AND AN INFINITE SERIES OF WAISTCOATS OUT OF THE BLACK
SATIN
HE CHUCKLED HE RUBBED HIS HANDS
OH IT IS RICH TO SEE AND HEAR HER
HE EXCLAIMED
IS SHE ORIGINAL IS SHE PIQUANT I WOULD NOT EXCHANGE
THIS ONE LITTLE ENGLISH GIRL FOR THE GRAND TURK'S WHOLE SERAGLIO GAZELLE
EYES HOURI FORMS AND ALL
THE EASTERN ALLUSION BIT ME AGAIN
I'LL NOT STAND YOU AN INCH IN THE
STEAD OF A SERAGLIO I SAID SO DON'T CONSIDER ME AN EQUIVALENT FOR
ONE
IF YOU HAVE A FANCY FOR ANYTHING IN THAT LINE AWAY WITH YOU SIR
TO THE BAZAARS OF STAMBOUL WITHOUT DELAY AND LAY OUT IN EXTENSIVE SLAVE
PURCHASES SOME OF THAT SPARE CASH YOU SEEM AT A LOSS TO SPEND
SATISFACTORILY HERE
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO JANET WHILE I AM BARGAINING FOR SO MANY TONS OF
FLESH AND SUCH AN ASSORTMENT OF BLACK EYES
I'LL BE PREPARING MYSELF TO GO OUT AS A MISSIONARY TO PREACH LIBERTY TO
THEM THAT ARE ENSLAVED YOUR HAREM INMATES AMONGST THE REST
I'LL GET
ADMITTED THERE AND I'LL STIR UP MUTINY AND YOU THREE TAILED BASHAW AS
YOU ARE SIR SHALL IN A TRICE FIND YOURSELF FETTERED AMONGST OUR HANDS
NOR WILL I FOR ONE CONSENT TO CUT YOUR BONDS TILL YOU HAVE SIGNED A
CHARTER THE MOST LIBERAL THAT DESPOT EVER YET CONFERRED
I WOULD CONSENT TO BE AT YOUR MERCY JANE
I WOULD HAVE NO MERCY MR
ROCHESTER IF YOU SUPPLICATED FOR IT WITH AN
EYE LIKE THAT
WHILE YOU LOOKED SO I SHOULD BE CERTAIN THAT WHATEVER
CHARTER YOU MIGHT GRANT UNDER COERCION YOUR FIRST ACT WHEN RELEASED
WOULD BE TO VIOLATE ITS CONDITIONS
WHY JANE WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE I FEAR YOU WILL COMPEL ME TO GO THROUGH
A PRIVATE MARRIAGE CEREMONY BESIDES THAT PERFORMED AT THE ALTAR
YOU
WILL STIPULATE I SEE FOR PECULIAR TERMS WHAT WILL THEY BE
I ONLY WANT AN EASY MIND SIR NOT CRUSHED BY CROWDED OBLIGATIONS
DO
YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID OF CELINE VARENS OF THE DIAMONDS THE
CASHMERES YOU GAVE HER I WILL NOT BE YOUR ENGLISH CELINE VARENS
I
SHALL CONTINUE TO ACT AS ADELE'S GOVERNESS BY THAT I SHALL EARN MY BOARD
AND LODGING AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR BESIDES
I'LL FURNISH MY OWN
WARDROBE OUT OF THAT MONEY AND YOU SHALL GIVE ME NOTHING BUT
WELL BUT WHAT
YOUR REGARD AND IF I GIVE YOU MINE IN RETURN THAT DEBT WILL BE QUIT
WELL FOR COOL NATIVE IMPUDENCE AND PURE INNATE PRIDE YOU HAVEN'T YOUR
EQUAL SAID HE
WE WERE NOW APPROACHING THORNFIELD
WILL IT PLEASE
YOU TO DINE WITH ME TO DAY HE ASKED AS WE RE ENTERED THE GATES
NO THANK YOU SIR
AND WHAT FOR 'NO THANK YOU IF ONE MAY INQUIRE
I NEVER HAVE DINED WITH YOU SIR AND I SEE NO REASON WHY I SHOULD NOW
TILL
TILL WHAT YOU DELIGHT IN HALF PHRASES
TILL I CAN'T HELP IT
DO YOU SUPPOSE I EAT LIKE AN OGRE OR A GHOUL THAT YOU DREAD BEING THE
COMPANION OF MY REPAST
I HAVE FORMED NO SUPPOSITION ON THE SUBJECT SIR BUT I WANT TO GO ON AS
USUAL FOR ANOTHER MONTH
YOU WILL GIVE UP YOUR GOVERNESSING SLAVERY AT ONCE
INDEED BEGGING YOUR PARDON SIR I SHALL NOT
I SHALL JUST GO ON WITH
IT AS USUAL
I SHALL KEEP OUT OF YOUR WAY ALL DAY AS I HAVE BEEN
ACCUSTOMED TO DO YOU MAY SEND FOR ME IN THE EVENING WHEN YOU FEEL
DISPOSED TO SEE ME AND I'LL COME THEN BUT AT NO OTHER TIME
I WANT A SMOKE JANE OR A PINCH OF SNUFF TO COMFORT ME UNDER ALL THIS
'POUR ME DONNER UNE CONTENANCE AS ADELE WOULD SAY AND UNFORTUNATELY I
HAVE NEITHER MY CIGAR CASE NOR MY SNUFF BOX
BUT LISTEN WHISPER
IT
IS YOUR TIME NOW LITTLE TYRANT BUT IT WILL BE MINE PRESENTLY AND WHEN
ONCE I HAVE FAIRLY SEIZED YOU TO HAVE AND TO HOLD I'LL
JUST FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING ATTACH YOU TO A CHAIN LIKE THIS TOUCHING
HIS WATCH GUARD
YES BONNY WEE THING I'LL WEAR YOU IN MY BOSOM LEST
MY JEWEL I SHOULD TYNE
HE SAID THIS AS HE HELPED ME TO ALIGHT FROM THE CARRIAGE AND WHILE HE
AFTERWARDS LIFTED OUT ADELE I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND MADE GOOD MY
RETREAT UPSTAIRS
HE DULY SUMMONED ME TO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
I HAD PREPARED AN
OCCUPATION FOR HIM FOR I WAS DETERMINED NOT TO SPEND THE WHOLE TIME IN A
TETE A TETE CONVERSATION
I REMEMBERED HIS FINE VOICE I KNEW HE LIKED
TO SING GOOD SINGERS GENERALLY DO
I WAS NO VOCALIST MYSELF AND IN
HIS FASTIDIOUS JUDGMENT NO MUSICIAN EITHER BUT I DELIGHTED IN
LISTENING WHEN THE PERFORMANCE WAS GOOD
NO SOONER HAD TWILIGHT THAT
HOUR OF ROMANCE BEGAN TO LOWER HER BLUE AND STARRY BANNER OVER THE
LATTICE THAN I ROSE OPENED THE PIANO AND ENTREATED HIM FOR THE LOVE
OF HEAVEN TO GIVE ME A SONG
HE SAID I WAS A CAPRICIOUS WITCH AND THAT
HE WOULD RATHER SING ANOTHER TIME BUT I AVERRED THAT NO TIME WAS LIKE
THE PRESENT
DID I LIKE HIS VOICE HE ASKED
VERY MUCH I WAS NOT FOND OF PAMPERING THAT SUSCEPTIBLE VANITY OF HIS
BUT FOR ONCE AND FROM MOTIVES OF EXPEDIENCY I WOULD E'EN SOOTHE AND
STIMULATE IT
THEN JANE YOU MUST PLAY THE ACCOMPANIMENT
VERY WELL SIR I WILL TRY
I DID TRY BUT WAS PRESENTLY SWEPT OFF THE STOOL AND DENOMINATED A
LITTLE BUNGLER BEING PUSHED UNCEREMONIOUSLY TO ONE SIDE WHICH WAS
PRECISELY WHAT I WISHED HE USURPED MY PLACE AND PROCEEDED TO ACCOMPANY
HIMSELF FOR HE COULD PLAY AS WELL AS SING
I HIED ME TO THE
WINDOW RECESS
AND WHILE I SAT THERE AND LOOKED OUT ON THE STILL TREES
AND DIM LAWN TO A SWEET AIR WAS SUNG IN MELLOW TONES THE FOLLOWING
STRAIN
THE TRUEST LOVE THAT EVER HEART
FELT AT ITS KINDLED CORE
DID THROUGH EACH VEIN IN QUICKENED START
THE TIDE OF BEING POUR
HER COMING WAS MY HOPE EACH DAY
HER PARTING WAS MY PAIN
THE CHANCE THAT DID HER STEPS DELAY
WAS ICE IN EVERY VEIN
I DREAMED IT WOULD BE NAMELESS BLISS
AS I LOVED LOVED TO BE
AND TO THIS OBJECT DID I PRESS
AS BLIND AS EAGERLY
BUT WIDE AS PATHLESS WAS THE SPACE
THAT LAY OUR LIVES BETWEEN
AND DANGEROUS AS THE FOAMY RACE
OF OCEAN SURGES GREEN
AND HAUNTED AS A ROBBER PATH
THROUGH WILDERNESS OR WOOD
FOR MIGHT AND RIGHT AND WOE AND WRATH
BETWEEN OUR SPIRITS STOOD
I DANGERS DARED I HINDRANCE SCORNED
I OMENS DID DEFY
WHATEVER MENACED HARASSED WARNED
I PASSED IMPETUOUS BY
ON SPED MY RAINBOW FAST AS LIGHT
I FLEW AS IN A DREAM
FOR GLORIOUS ROSE UPON MY SIGHT
THAT CHILD OF SHOWER AND GLEAM
STILL BRIGHT ON CLOUDS OF SUFFERING DIM
SHINES THAT SOFT SOLEMN JOY
NOR CARE I NOW HOW DENSE AND GRIM
DISASTERS GATHER NIGH
I CARE NOT IN THIS MOMENT SWEET
THOUGH ALL I HAVE RUSHED O'ER
SHOULD COME ON PINION STRONG AND FLEET
PROCLAIMING VENGEANCE SORE
THOUGH HAUGHTY HATE SHOULD STRIKE ME DOWN
RIGHT BAR APPROACH TO ME
AND GRINDING MIGHT WITH FURIOUS FROWN
SWEAR ENDLESS ENMITY
MY LOVE HAS PLACED HER LITTLE HAND
WITH NOBLE FAITH IN MINE
AND VOWED THAT WEDLOCK'S SACRED BAND
OUR NATURE SHALL ENTWINE
MY LOVE HAS SWORN WITH SEALING KISS
WITH ME TO LIVE TO DIE
I HAVE AT LAST MY NAMELESS BLISS
AS I LOVE LOVED AM I
HE ROSE AND CAME TOWARDS ME AND I SAW HIS FACE ALL KINDLED AND HIS FULL
FALCON EYE FLASHING AND TENDERNESS AND PASSION IN EVERY LINEAMENT
I
QUAILED MOMENTARILY THEN I RALLIED
SOFT SCENE DARING DEMONSTRATION I
WOULD NOT HAVE AND I STOOD IN PERIL OF BOTH A WEAPON OF DEFENCE MUST BE
PREPARED I WHETTED MY TONGUE AS HE REACHED ME I ASKED WITH ASPERITY
WHOM HE WAS GOING TO MARRY NOW
THAT WAS A STRANGE QUESTION TO BE PUT BY HIS DARLING JANE
INDEED I CONSIDERED IT A VERY NATURAL AND NECESSARY ONE HE HAD TALKED
OF HIS FUTURE WIFE DYING WITH HIM
WHAT DID HE MEAN BY SUCH A PAGAN
IDEA I HAD NO INTENTION OF DYING WITH HIM HE MIGHT DEPEND ON THAT
OH ALL HE LONGED ALL HE PRAYED FOR WAS THAT I MIGHT LIVE WITH HIM
DEATH WAS NOT FOR SUCH AS I
INDEED IT WAS I HAD AS GOOD A RIGHT TO DIE WHEN MY TIME CAME AS HE HAD
BUT I SHOULD BIDE THAT TIME AND NOT BE HURRIED AWAY IN A SUTTEE
WOULD I FORGIVE HIM FOR THE SELFISH IDEA AND PROVE MY PARDON BY A
RECONCILING KISS
NO I WOULD RATHER BE EXCUSED
HERE I HEARD MYSELF APOSTROPHISED AS A HARD LITTLE THING AND IT WAS
ADDED ANY OTHER WOMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MELTED TO MARROW AT HEARING SUCH
STANZAS CROONED IN HER PRAISE
I ASSURED HIM I WAS NATURALLY HARD VERY FLINTY AND THAT HE WOULD OFTEN
FIND ME SO AND THAT MOREOVER I WAS DETERMINED TO SHOW HIM DIVERS
RUGGED POINTS IN MY CHARACTER BEFORE THE ENSUING FOUR WEEKS ELAPSED HE
SHOULD KNOW FULLY WHAT SORT OF A BARGAIN HE HAD MADE WHILE THERE WAS YET
TIME TO RESCIND IT
WOULD I BE QUIET AND TALK RATIONALLY
I WOULD BE QUIET IF HE LIKED AND AS TO TALKING RATIONALLY I FLATTERED
MYSELF I WAS DOING THAT NOW
HE FRETTED PISHED AND PSHAWED
VERY GOOD I THOUGHT YOU MAY FUME
AND FIDGET AS YOU PLEASE BUT THIS IS THE BEST PLAN TO PURSUE WITH YOU I
AM CERTAIN
I LIKE YOU MORE THAN I CAN SAY BUT I'LL NOT SINK INTO A
BATHOS OF SENTIMENT AND WITH THIS NEEDLE OF REPARTEE I'LL KEEP YOU FROM
THE EDGE OF THE GULF TOO AND MOREOVER MAINTAIN BY ITS PUNGENT AID THAT
DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND MYSELF MOST CONDUCIVE TO OUR REAL MUTUAL
ADVANTAGE
FROM LESS TO MORE I WORKED HIM UP TO CONSIDERABLE IRRITATION THEN
AFTER HE HAD RETIRED IN DUDGEON QUITE TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM I
GOT UP AND SAYING I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SIR IN MY NATURAL AND
WONTED RESPECTFUL MANNER I SLIPPED OUT BY THE SIDE DOOR AND GOT AWAY
THE SYSTEM THUS ENTERED ON I PURSUED DURING THE WHOLE SEASON OF
PROBATION AND WITH THE BEST SUCCESS
HE WAS KEPT TO BE SURE RATHER
CROSS AND CRUSTY BUT ON THE WHOLE I COULD SEE HE WAS EXCELLENTLY
ENTERTAINED AND THAT A LAMB LIKE SUBMISSION AND TURTLE DOVE SENSIBILITY
WHILE FOSTERING HIS DESPOTISM MORE WOULD HAVE PLEASED HIS JUDGMENT
SATISFIED HIS COMMON SENSE AND EVEN SUITED HIS TASTE LESS
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S PRESENCE I WAS AS FORMERLY DEFERENTIAL AND QUIET ANY
OTHER LINE OF CONDUCT BEING UNCALLED FOR IT WAS ONLY IN THE EVENING
CONFERENCES I THUS THWARTED AND AFFLICTED HIM
HE CONTINUED TO SEND FOR
ME PUNCTUALLY THE MOMENT THE CLOCK STRUCK SEVEN THOUGH WHEN I APPEARED
BEFORE HIM NOW HE HAD NO SUCH HONEYED TERMS AS LOVE AND DARLING ON
HIS LIPS THE BEST WORDS AT MY SERVICE WERE PROVOKING PUPPET
MALICIOUS ELF SPRITE CHANGELING C
FOR CARESSES TOO I NOW
GOT GRIMACES FOR A PRESSURE OF THE HAND A PINCH ON THE ARM FOR A KISS
ON THE CHEEK A SEVERE TWEAK OF THE EAR
IT WAS ALL RIGHT AT PRESENT I
DECIDEDLY PREFERRED THESE FIERCE FAVOURS TO ANYTHING MORE TENDER
MRS
FAIRFAX I SAW APPROVED ME HER ANXIETY ON MY ACCOUNT VANISHED
THEREFORE I WAS CERTAIN I DID WELL
MEANTIME MR
ROCHESTER AFFIRMED I
WAS WEARING HIM TO SKIN AND BONE AND THREATENED AWFUL VENGEANCE FOR MY
PRESENT CONDUCT AT SOME PERIOD FAST COMING
I LAUGHED IN MY SLEEVE AT
HIS MENACES
I CAN KEEP YOU IN REASONABLE CHECK NOW I REFLECTED AND
I DON'T DOUBT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT HEREAFTER IF ONE EXPEDIENT LOSES ITS
VIRTUE ANOTHER MUST BE DEVISED
YET AFTER ALL MY TASK WAS NOT AN EASY ONE OFTEN I WOULD RATHER HAVE
PLEASED THAN TEASED HIM
MY FUTURE HUSBAND WAS BECOMING TO ME MY WHOLE
WORLD AND MORE THAN THE WORLD ALMOST MY HOPE OF HEAVEN
HE STOOD
BETWEEN ME AND EVERY THOUGHT OF RELIGION AS AN ECLIPSE INTERVENES
BETWEEN MAN AND THE BROAD SUN
I COULD NOT IN THOSE DAYS SEE GOD FOR
HIS CREATURE OF WHOM I HAD MADE AN IDOL
CHAPTER XXV
THE MONTH OF COURTSHIP HAD WASTED ITS VERY LAST HOURS WERE BEING
NUMBERED
THERE WAS NO PUTTING OFF THE DAY THAT ADVANCED THE BRIDAL
DAY AND ALL PREPARATIONS FOR ITS ARRIVAL WERE COMPLETE
I AT LEAST
HAD NOTHING MORE TO DO THERE WERE MY TRUNKS PACKED LOCKED CORDED
RANGED IN A ROW ALONG THE WALL OF MY LITTLE CHAMBER TO MORROW AT THIS
TIME THEY WOULD BE FAR ON THEIR ROAD TO LONDON AND SO SHOULD I
D V OR RATHER NOT I BUT ONE JANE ROCHESTER A PERSON WHOM AS YET I
KNEW NOT
THE CARDS OF ADDRESS ALONE REMAINED TO NAIL ON THEY LAY FOUR
LITTLE SQUARES IN THE DRAWER
MR
ROCHESTER HAD HIMSELF WRITTEN THE
DIRECTION MRS
ROCHESTER HOTEL LONDON ON EACH I COULD NOT
PERSUADE MYSELF TO AFFIX THEM OR TO HAVE THEM AFFIXED
MRS
ROCHESTER
SHE DID NOT EXIST SHE WOULD NOT BE BORN TILL TO MORROW SOME TIME AFTER
EIGHT O'CLOCK A M AND I WOULD WAIT TO BE ASSURED SHE HAD COME INTO THE
WORLD ALIVE BEFORE I ASSIGNED TO HER ALL THAT PROPERTY
IT WAS ENOUGH
THAT IN YONDER CLOSET OPPOSITE MY DRESSING TABLE GARMENTS SAID TO BE
HERS HAD ALREADY DISPLACED MY BLACK STUFF LOWOOD FROCK AND STRAW BONNET
FOR NOT TO ME APPERTAINED THAT SUIT OF WEDDING RAIMENT THE
PEARL COLOURED ROBE THE VAPOURY VEIL PENDENT FROM THE USURPED
PORTMANTEAU
I SHUT THE CLOSET TO CONCEAL THE STRANGE WRAITH LIKE
APPAREL IT CONTAINED WHICH AT THIS EVENING HOUR NINE O'CLOCK GAVE OUT
CERTAINLY A MOST GHOSTLY SHIMMER THROUGH THE SHADOW OF MY APARTMENT
I
WILL LEAVE YOU BY YOURSELF WHITE DREAM I SAID
I AM FEVERISH I HEAR
THE WIND BLOWING I WILL GO OUT OF DOORS AND FEEL IT
IT WAS NOT ONLY THE HURRY OF PREPARATION THAT MADE ME FEVERISH NOT ONLY
THE ANTICIPATION OF THE GREAT CHANGE THE NEW LIFE WHICH WAS TO COMMENCE
TO MORROW BOTH THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HAD THEIR SHARE DOUBTLESS IN
PRODUCING THAT RESTLESS EXCITED MOOD WHICH HURRIED ME FORTH AT THIS LATE
HOUR INTO THE DARKENING GROUNDS BUT A THIRD CAUSE INFLUENCED MY MIND
MORE THAN THEY
I HAD AT HEART A STRANGE AND ANXIOUS THOUGHT
SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
WHICH I COULD NOT COMPREHEND NO ONE KNEW OF OR HAD SEEN THE EVENT BUT
MYSELF IT HAD TAKEN PLACE THE PRECEDING NIGHT
MR
ROCHESTER THAT NIGHT
WAS ABSENT FROM HOME NOR WAS HE YET RETURNED BUSINESS HAD CALLED HIM TO
A SMALL ESTATE OF TWO OR THREE FARMS HE POSSESSED THIRTY MILES
OFF BUSINESS IT WAS REQUISITE HE SHOULD SETTLE IN PERSON PREVIOUS TO
HIS MEDITATED DEPARTURE FROM ENGLAND
I WAITED NOW HIS RETURN EAGER TO
DISBURTHEN MY MIND AND TO SEEK OF HIM THE SOLUTION OF THE ENIGMA THAT
PERPLEXED ME
STAY TILL HE COMES READER AND WHEN I DISCLOSE MY SECRET
TO HIM YOU SHALL SHARE THE CONFIDENCE
I SOUGHT THE ORCHARD DRIVEN TO ITS SHELTER BY THE WIND WHICH ALL DAY
HAD BLOWN STRONG AND FULL FROM THE SOUTH WITHOUT HOWEVER BRINGING A
SPECK OF RAIN
INSTEAD OF SUBSIDING AS NIGHT DREW ON IT SEEMED TO
AUGMENT ITS RUSH AND DEEPEN ITS ROAR THE TREES BLEW STEADFASTLY ONE WAY
NEVER WRITHING ROUND AND SCARCELY TOSSING BACK THEIR BOUGHS ONCE IN AN
HOUR SO CONTINUOUS WAS THE STRAIN BENDING THEIR BRANCHY HEADS
NORTHWARD THE CLOUDS DRIFTED FROM POLE TO POLE FAST FOLLOWING MASS ON
MASS NO GLIMPSE OF BLUE SKY HAD BEEN VISIBLE THAT JULY DAY
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN WILD PLEASURE I RAN BEFORE THE WIND
DELIVERING MY TROUBLE OF MIND TO THE MEASURELESS AIR TORRENT THUNDERING
THROUGH SPACE
DESCENDING THE LAUREL WALK I FACED THE WRECK OF THE
CHESTNUT TREE IT STOOD UP BLACK AND RIVEN THE TRUNK SPLIT DOWN THE
CENTRE GASPED GHASTLY
THE CLOVEN HALVES WERE NOT BROKEN FROM EACH
OTHER FOR THE FIRM BASE AND STRONG ROOTS KEPT THEM UNSUNDERED BELOW
THOUGH COMMUNITY OF VITALITY WAS DESTROYED THE SAP COULD FLOW NO MORE
THEIR GREAT BOUGHS ON EACH SIDE WERE DEAD AND NEXT WINTER'S TEMPESTS
WOULD BE SURE TO FELL ONE OR BOTH TO EARTH AS YET HOWEVER THEY MIGHT
BE SAID TO FORM ONE TREE A RUIN BUT AN ENTIRE RUIN
YOU DID RIGHT TO HOLD FAST TO EACH OTHER I SAID AS IF THE MONSTER
SPLINTERS WERE LIVING THINGS AND COULD HEAR ME
I THINK SCATHED AS
YOU LOOK AND CHARRED AND SCORCHED THERE MUST BE A LITTLE SENSE OF LIFE
IN YOU YET RISING OUT OF THAT ADHESION AT THE FAITHFUL HONEST ROOTS
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE GREEN LEAVES MORE NEVER MORE SEE BIRDS MAKING NESTS
AND SINGING IDYLS IN YOUR BOUGHS THE TIME OF PLEASURE AND LOVE IS OVER
WITH YOU BUT YOU ARE NOT DESOLATE EACH OF YOU HAS A COMRADE TO
SYMPATHISE WITH HIM IN HIS DECAY AS I LOOKED UP AT THEM THE MOON
APPEARED MOMENTARILY IN THAT PART OF THE SKY WHICH FILLED THEIR FISSURE
HER DISK WAS BLOOD RED AND HALF OVERCAST SHE SEEMED TO THROW ON ME ONE
BEWILDERED DREARY GLANCE AND BURIED HERSELF AGAIN INSTANTLY IN THE DEEP
DRIFT OF CLOUD
THE WIND FELL FOR A SECOND ROUND THORNFIELD BUT FAR
AWAY OVER WOOD AND WATER POURED A WILD MELANCHOLY WAIL IT WAS SAD TO
LISTEN TO AND I RAN OFF AGAIN
HERE AND THERE I STRAYED THROUGH THE ORCHARD GATHERED UP THE APPLES WITH
WHICH THE GRASS ROUND THE TREE ROOTS WAS THICKLY STREWN THEN I EMPLOYED
MYSELF IN DIVIDING THE RIPE FROM THE UNRIPE I CARRIED THEM INTO THE
HOUSE AND PUT THEM AWAY IN THE STORE ROOM
THEN I REPAIRED TO THE
LIBRARY TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE FIRE WAS LIT FOR THOUGH SUMMER I KNEW
ON SUCH A GLOOMY EVENING MR
ROCHESTER WOULD LIKE TO SEE A CHEERFUL
HEARTH WHEN HE CAME IN YES THE FIRE HAD BEEN KINDLED SOME TIME AND
BURNT WELL
I PLACED HIS ARM CHAIR BY THE CHIMNEY CORNER I WHEELED THE
TABLE NEAR IT I LET DOWN THE CURTAIN AND HAD THE CANDLES BROUGHT IN
READY FOR LIGHTING
MORE RESTLESS THAN EVER WHEN I HAD COMPLETED THESE
ARRANGEMENTS I COULD NOT SIT STILL NOR EVEN REMAIN IN THE HOUSE A
LITTLE TIME PIECE IN THE ROOM AND THE OLD CLOCK IN THE HALL
SIMULTANEOUSLY STRUCK TEN
HOW LATE IT GROWS I SAID
I WILL RUN DOWN TO THE GATES IT IS
MOONLIGHT AT INTERVALS I CAN SEE A GOOD WAY ON THE ROAD
HE MAY BE
COMING NOW AND TO MEET HIM WILL SAVE SOME MINUTES OF SUSPENSE
THE WIND ROARED HIGH IN THE GREAT TREES WHICH EMBOWERED THE GATES BUT
THE ROAD AS FAR AS I COULD SEE TO THE RIGHT HAND AND THE LEFT WAS ALL
STILL AND SOLITARY SAVE FOR THE SHADOWS OF CLOUDS CROSSING IT AT
INTERVALS AS THE MOON LOOKED OUT IT WAS BUT A LONG PALE LINE UNVARIED
BY ONE MOVING SPECK
A PUERILE TEAR DIMMED MY EYE WHILE I LOOKED A TEAR OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND
IMPATIENCE ASHAMED OF IT I WIPED IT AWAY
I LINGERED THE MOON SHUT
HERSELF WHOLLY WITHIN HER CHAMBER AND DREW CLOSE HER CURTAIN OF DENSE
CLOUD THE NIGHT GREW DARK RAIN CAME DRIVING FAST ON THE GALE
I WISH HE WOULD COME I WISH HE WOULD COME I EXCLAIMED SEIZED WITH
HYPOCHONDRIAC FOREBODING
I HAD EXPECTED HIS ARRIVAL BEFORE TEA NOW IT
WAS DARK WHAT COULD KEEP HIM HAD AN ACCIDENT HAPPENED THE EVENT OF
LAST NIGHT AGAIN RECURRED TO ME
I INTERPRETED IT AS A WARNING OF
DISASTER
I FEARED MY HOPES WERE TOO BRIGHT TO BE REALISED AND I HAD
ENJOYED SO MUCH BLISS LATELY THAT I IMAGINED MY FORTUNE HAD PASSED ITS
MERIDIAN AND MUST NOW DECLINE
WELL I CANNOT RETURN TO THE HOUSE I THOUGHT I CANNOT SIT BY THE
FIRESIDE WHILE HE IS ABROAD IN INCLEMENT WEATHER BETTER TIRE MY LIMBS
THAN STRAIN MY HEART I WILL GO FORWARD AND MEET HIM
I SET OUT I WALKED FAST BUT NOT FAR ERE I HAD MEASURED A QUARTER OF A
MILE I HEARD THE TRAMP OF HOOFS A HORSEMAN CAME ON FULL GALLOP A DOG
RAN BY HIS SIDE
AWAY WITH EVIL PRESENTIMENT IT WAS HE HERE HE WAS
MOUNTED ON MESROUR FOLLOWED BY PILOT
HE SAW ME FOR THE MOON HAD
OPENED A BLUE FIELD IN THE SKY AND RODE IN IT WATERY BRIGHT HE TOOK HIS
HAT OFF AND WAVED IT ROUND HIS HEAD
I NOW RAN TO MEET HIM
THERE HE EXCLAIMED AS HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND BENT FROM THE
SADDLE YOU CAN'T DO WITHOUT ME THAT IS EVIDENT
STEP ON MY BOOT TOE
GIVE ME BOTH HANDS MOUNT
I OBEYED JOY MADE ME AGILE I SPRANG UP BEFORE HIM
A HEARTY KISSING I
GOT FOR A WELCOME AND SOME BOASTFUL TRIUMPH WHICH I SWALLOWED AS WELL
AS I COULD
HE CHECKED HIMSELF IN HIS EXULTATION TO DEMAND BUT IS
THERE ANYTHING THE MATTER JANET THAT YOU COME TO MEET ME AT SUCH AN
HOUR IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG
NO BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER COME
I COULD NOT BEAR TO WAIT IN THE
HOUSE FOR YOU ESPECIALLY WITH THIS RAIN AND WIND
RAIN AND WIND INDEED YES YOU ARE DRIPPING LIKE A MERMAID PULL MY
CLOAK ROUND YOU BUT I THINK YOU ARE FEVERISH JANE BOTH YOUR CHEEK AND
HAND ARE BURNING HOT

EEL THIS LAST MONTH AND AS THORNY AS A BRIAR ROSE I COULD NOT LAY A
FINGER ANYWHERE BUT I WAS PRICKED AND NOW I SEEM TO HAVE GATHERED UP A
STRAY LAMB IN MY ARMS
YOU WANDERED OUT OF THE FOLD TO SEEK YOUR
SHEPHERD DID YOU JANE
I WANTED YOU BUT DON'T BOAST
HERE WE ARE AT THORNFIELD NOW LET ME
GET DOWN
HE LANDED ME ON THE PAVEMENT
AS JOHN TOOK HIS HORSE AND HE FOLLOWED ME
INTO THE HALL HE TOLD ME TO MAKE HASTE AND PUT SOMETHING DRY ON AND
THEN RETURN TO HIM IN THE LIBRARY AND HE STOPPED ME AS I MADE FOR THE
STAIRCASE TO EXTORT A PROMISE THAT I WOULD NOT BE LONG NOR WAS I LONG
IN FIVE MINUTES I REJOINED HIM
I FOUND HIM AT SUPPER
TAKE A SEAT AND BEAR ME COMPANY JANE PLEASE GOD IT IS THE LAST MEAL
BUT ONE YOU WILL EAT AT THORNFIELD HALL FOR A LONG TIME
I SAT DOWN NEAR HIM BUT TOLD HIM I COULD NOT EAT

THOUGHTS I HAVE IN MY HEAD
EVERYTHING IN LIFE SEEMS UNREAL
EXCEPT ME I AM SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH TOUCH ME
YOU SIR ARE THE MOST PHANTOM LIKE OF ALL YOU ARE A MERE DREAM
HE HELD OUT HIS HAND LAUGHING

CLOSE TO MY EYES

AS A LONG STRONG ARM
YES THOUGH I TOUCH IT IT IS A DREAM SAID I AS I PUT IT DOWN FROM
BEFORE MY FACE
SIR HAVE YOU FINISHED SUPPER

I RANG THE BELL AND ORDERED AWAY THE TRAY
WHEN WE WERE AGAIN ALONE I
STIRRED THE FIRE AND THEN TOOK A LOW SEAT AT MY MASTER'S KNEE

GIVE ME YOUR CONFIDENCE JANE HE SAID RELIEVE YOUR MIND OF ANY
WEIGHT THAT OPPRESSES IT BY IMPARTING IT TO ME
WHAT DO YOU FEAR THAT
I SHALL NOT PROVE A GOOD HUSBAND
IT IS THE IDEA FARTHEST FROM MY THOUGHTS
ARE YOU APPREHENSIVE OF THE NEW SPHERE YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER OF THE
NEW LIFE INTO WHICH YOU ARE PASSING
NO
YOU PUZZLE ME JANE YOUR LOOK AND TONE OF SORROWFUL AUDACITY PERPLEX
AND PAIN ME
I WANT AN EXPLANATION
THEN SIR LISTEN
YOU WERE FROM HOME LAST NIGHT
I WAS I KNOW THAT AND YOU HINTED A WHILE AGO AT SOMETHING WHICH HAD
HAPPENED IN MY ABSENCE NOTHING PROBABLY OF CONSEQUENCE BUT IN
SHORT IT HAS DISTURBED YOU
LET ME HEAR IT
MRS
FAIRFAX HAS SAID
SOMETHING PERHAPS OR YOU HAVE OVERHEARD THE SERVANTS TALK YOUR
SENSITIVE SELF RESPECT HAS BEEN WOUNDED
NO SIR IT STRUCK TWELVE I WAITED TILL THE TIME PIECE HAD CONCLUDED
ITS SILVER CHIME AND THE CLOCK ITS HOARSE VIBRATING STROKE AND THEN I
PROCEEDED
ALL DAY YESTERDAY I WAS VERY BUSY AND VERY HAPPY IN MY CEASELESS
BUSTLE FOR I AM NOT AS YOU SEEM TO THINK TROUBLED BY ANY HAUNTING
FEARS ABOUT THE NEW SPHERE ET CETERA I THINK IT A GLORIOUS THING TO
HAVE THE HOPE OF LIVING WITH YOU BECAUSE I LOVE YOU
NO SIR DON'T
CARESS ME NOW LET ME TALK UNDISTURBED
YESTERDAY I TRUSTED WELL IN
PROVIDENCE AND BELIEVED THAT EVENTS WERE WORKING TOGETHER FOR YOUR GOOD
AND MINE IT WAS A FINE DAY IF YOU RECOLLECT THE CALMNESS OF THE AIR
AND SKY FORBADE APPREHENSIONS RESPECTING YOUR SAFETY OR COMFORT ON YOUR
JOURNEY
I WALKED A LITTLE WHILE ON THE PAVEMENT AFTER TEA THINKING OF
YOU AND I BEHELD YOU IN IMAGINATION SO NEAR ME I SCARCELY MISSED YOUR
ACTUAL PRESENCE
I THOUGHT OF THE LIFE THAT LAY BEFORE ME YOUR LIFE
SIR AN EXISTENCE MORE EXPANSIVE AND STIRRING THAN MY OWN AS MUCH MORE
SO AS THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA TO WHICH THE BROOK RUNS ARE THAN THE SHALLOWS
OF ITS OWN STRAIT CHANNEL
I WONDERED WHY MORALISTS CALL THIS WORLD A
DREARY WILDERNESS FOR ME IT BLOSSOMED LIKE A ROSE
JUST AT SUNSET THE
AIR TURNED COLD AND THE SKY CLOUDY I WENT IN SOPHIE CALLED ME UPSTAIRS
TO LOOK AT MY WEDDING DRESS WHICH THEY HAD JUST BROUGHT AND UNDER IT IN
THE BOX I FOUND YOUR PRESENT THE VEIL WHICH IN YOUR PRINCELY
EXTRAVAGANCE YOU SENT FOR FROM LONDON RESOLVED I SUPPOSE SINCE I
WOULD NOT HAVE JEWELS TO CHEAT ME INTO ACCEPTING SOMETHING AS COSTLY
I
SMILED AS I UNFOLDED IT AND DEVISED HOW I WOULD TEASE YOU ABOUT YOUR
ARISTOCRATIC TASTES AND YOUR EFFORTS TO MASQUE YOUR PLEBEIAN BRIDE IN
THE ATTRIBUTES OF A PEERESS
I THOUGHT HOW I WOULD CARRY DOWN TO YOU THE
SQUARE OF UNEMBROIDERED BLOND I HAD MYSELF PREPARED AS A COVERING FOR MY
LOW BORN HEAD AND ASK IF THAT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A WOMAN WHO COULD
BRING HER HUSBAND NEITHER FORTUNE BEAUTY NOR CONNECTIONS
I SAW
PLAINLY HOW YOU WOULD LOOK AND HEARD YOUR IMPETUOUS REPUBLICAN ANSWERS
AND YOUR HAUGHTY DISAVOWAL OF ANY NECESSITY ON YOUR PART TO AUGMENT YOUR
WEALTH OR ELEVATE YOUR STANDING BY MARRYING EITHER A PURSE OR A
CORONET
HOW WELL YOU READ ME YOU WITCH INTERPOSED MR
ROCHESTER BUT WHAT
DID YOU FIND IN THE VEIL BESIDES ITS EMBROIDERY DID YOU FIND POISON OR
A DAGGER THAT YOU LOOK SO MOURNFUL NOW
NO NO SIR BESIDES THE DELICACY AND RICHNESS OF THE FABRIC I FOUND
NOTHING SAVE FAIRFAX ROCHESTER'S PRIDE AND THAT DID NOT SCARE ME
BECAUSE I AM USED TO THE SIGHT OF THE DEMON
BUT SIR AS IT GREW DARK
THE WIND ROSE IT BLEW YESTERDAY EVENING NOT AS IT BLOWS NOW WILD AND
HIGH BUT 'WITH A SULLEN MOANING SOUND' FAR MORE EERIE
I WISHED YOU
WERE AT HOME
I CAME INTO THIS ROOM AND THE SIGHT OF THE EMPTY CHAIR
AND FIRELESS HEARTH CHILLED ME
FOR SOME TIME AFTER I WENT TO BED I
COULD NOT SLEEP A SENSE OF ANXIOUS EXCITEMENT DISTRESSED ME
THE GALE
STILL RISING SEEMED TO MY EAR TO MUFFLE A MOURNFUL UNDER SOUND WHETHER
IN THE HOUSE OR ABROAD I COULD NOT AT FIRST TELL BUT IT RECURRED
DOUBTFUL YET DOLEFUL AT EVERY LULL AT LAST I MADE OUT IT MUST BE SOME
DOG HOWLING AT A DISTANCE
I WAS GLAD WHEN IT CEASED
ON SLEEPING I
CONTINUED IN DREAMS THE IDEA OF A DARK AND GUSTY NIGHT
I CONTINUED ALSO
THE WISH TO BE WITH YOU AND EXPERIENCED A STRANGE REGRETFUL
CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME BARRIER DIVIDING US
DURING ALL MY FIRST SLEEP I
WAS FOLLOWING THE WINDINGS OF AN UNKNOWN ROAD TOTAL OBSCURITY ENVIRONED
ME RAIN PELTED ME I WAS BURDENED WITH THE CHARGE OF A LITTLE CHILD A
VERY SMALL CREATURE TOO YOUNG AND FEEBLE TO WALK AND WHICH SHIVERED IN
MY COLD ARMS AND WAILED PITEOUSLY IN MY EAR
I THOUGHT SIR THAT YOU
WERE ON THE ROAD A LONG WAY BEFORE ME AND I STRAINED EVERY NERVE TO
OVERTAKE YOU AND MADE EFFORT ON EFFORT TO UTTER YOUR NAME AND ENTREAT
YOU TO STOP BUT MY MOVEMENTS WERE FETTERED AND MY VOICE STILL DIED AWAY
INARTICULATE WHILE YOU I FELT WITHDREW FARTHER AND FARTHER EVERY
MOMENT
AND THESE DREAMS WEIGH ON YOUR SPIRITS NOW JANE WHEN I AM CLOSE TO
YOU LITTLE NERVOUS SUBJECT FORGET VISIONARY WOE AND THINK ONLY OF
REAL HAPPINESS YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME JANET YES I WILL NOT FORGET THAT
AND YOU CANNOT DENY IT
THOSE WORDS DID NOT DIE INARTICULATE ON YOUR
LIPS
I HEARD THEM CLEAR AND SOFT A THOUGHT TOO SOLEMN PERHAPS BUT
SWEET AS MUSIC 'I THINK IT IS A GLORIOUS THING TO HAVE THE HOPE OF
LIVING WITH YOU EDWARD BECAUSE I LOVE YOU DO YOU LOVE ME
JANE REPEAT IT
I DO SIR I DO WITH MY WHOLE HEART
WELL HE SAID AFTER SOME MINUTES' SILENCE IT IS STRANGE BUT THAT
SENTENCE HAS PENETRATED MY BREAST PAINFULLY
WHY I THINK BECAUSE YOU
SAID IT WITH SUCH AN EARNEST RELIGIOUS ENERGY AND BECAUSE YOUR UPWARD
GAZE AT ME NOW IS THE VERY SUBLIME OF FAITH TRUTH AND DEVOTION IT IS
TOO MUCH AS IF SOME SPIRIT WERE NEAR ME
LOOK WICKED JANE AS YOU KNOW
WELL HOW TO LOOK COIN ONE OF YOUR WILD SHY PROVOKING SMILES TELL ME
YOU HATE ME TEASE ME VEX ME DO ANYTHING BUT MOVE ME I WOULD RATHER BE
INCENSED THAN SADDENED
I WILL TEASE YOU AND VEX YOU TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT WHEN I HAVE
FINISHED MY TALE BUT HEAR ME TO THE END
I THOUGHT JANE YOU HAD TOLD ME ALL
I THOUGHT I HAD FOUND THE SOURCE
OF YOUR MELANCHOLY IN A DREAM
I SHOOK MY HEAD
WHAT IS THERE MORE BUT I WILL NOT BELIEVE IT TO BE
ANYTHING IMPORTANT
I WARN YOU OF INCREDULITY BEFOREHAND
GO ON
THE DISQUIETUDE OF HIS AIR THE SOMEWHAT APPREHENSIVE IMPATIENCE OF HIS
MANNER SURPRISED ME BUT I PROCEEDED
I DREAMT ANOTHER DREAM SIR THAT THORNFIELD HALL WAS A DREARY RUIN THE
RETREAT OF BATS AND OWLS
I THOUGHT THAT OF ALL THE STATELY FRONT
NOTHING REMAINED BUT A SHELL LIKE WALL VERY HIGH AND VERY
FRAGILE LOOKING
I WANDERED ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT THROUGH THE GRASS
GROWN ENCLOSURE WITHIN HERE I STUMBLED OVER A MARBLE HEARTH AND THERE
OVER A FALLEN FRAGMENT OF CORNICE
WRAPPED UP IN A SHAWL I STILL
CARRIED THE UNKNOWN LITTLE CHILD I MIGHT NOT LAY IT DOWN ANYWHERE
HOWEVER TIRED WERE MY ARMS HOWEVER MUCH ITS WEIGHT IMPEDED MY PROGRESS
I MUST RETAIN IT
I HEARD THE GALLOP OF A HORSE AT A DISTANCE ON THE
ROAD I WAS SURE IT WAS YOU AND YOU WERE DEPARTING FOR MANY YEARS AND
FOR A DISTANT COUNTRY
I CLIMBED THE THIN WALL WITH FRANTIC PERILOUS
HASTE EAGER TO CATCH ONE GLIMPSE OF YOU FROM THE TOP THE STONES ROLLED
FROM UNDER MY FEET THE IVY BRANCHES I GRASPED GAVE WAY THE CHILD CLUNG
ROUND MY NECK IN TERROR AND ALMOST STRANGLED ME AT LAST I GAINED THE
SUMMIT
I SAW YOU LIKE A SPECK ON A WHITE TRACK LESSENING EVERY MOMENT
THE BLAST BLEW SO STRONG I COULD NOT STAND
I SAT DOWN ON THE NARROW
LEDGE I HUSHED THE SCARED INFANT IN MY LAP YOU TURNED AN ANGLE OF THE
ROAD I BENT FORWARD TO TAKE A LAST LOOK THE WALL CRUMBLED I WAS
SHAKEN THE CHILD ROLLED FROM MY KNEE I LOST MY BALANCE FELL AND
WOKE
NOW JANE THAT IS ALL
ALL THE PREFACE SIR THE TALE IS YET TO COME
ON WAKING A GLEAM
DAZZLED MY EYES I THOUGHT OH IT IS DAYLIGHT BUT I WAS MISTAKEN IT
WAS ONLY CANDLELIGHT
SOPHIE I SUPPOSED HAD COME IN
THERE WAS A
LIGHT IN THE DRESSING TABLE AND THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET WHERE BEFORE
GOING TO BED I HAD HUNG MY WEDDING DRESS AND VEIL STOOD OPEN I HEARD A
RUSTLING THERE
I ASKED 'SOPHIE WHAT ARE YOU DOING NO ONE ANSWERED
BUT A FORM EMERGED FROM THE CLOSET IT TOOK THE LIGHT HELD IT ALOFT AND
SURVEYED THE GARMENTS PENDENT FROM THE PORTMANTEAU
'SOPHIE SOPHIE I
AGAIN CRIED AND STILL IT WAS SILENT
I HAD RISEN UP IN BED I BENT
FORWARD FIRST SURPRISE THEN BEWILDERMENT CAME OVER ME AND THEN MY
BLOOD CREPT COLD THROUGH MY VEINS
MR
ROCHESTER THIS WAS NOT SOPHIE
IT WAS NOT LEAH IT WAS NOT MRS
FAIRFAX IT WAS NOT NO I WAS SURE OF
IT AND AM STILL IT WAS NOT EVEN THAT STRANGE WOMAN GRACE POOLE
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM INTERRUPTED MY MASTER
NO SIR I SOLEMNLY ASSURE YOU TO THE CONTRARY
THE SHAPE STANDING
BEFORE ME HAD NEVER CROSSED MY EYES WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF THORNFIELD
HALL BEFORE THE HEIGHT THE CONTOUR WERE NEW TO ME
DESCRIBE IT JANE
IT SEEMED SIR A WOMAN TALL AND LARGE WITH THICK AND DARK HAIR
HANGING LONG DOWN HER BACK
I KNOW NOT WHAT DRESS SHE HAD ON IT WAS
WHITE AND STRAIGHT BUT WHETHER GOWN SHEET OR SHROUD I CANNOT TELL
DID YOU SEE HER FACE
NOT AT FIRST
BUT PRESENTLY SHE TOOK MY VEIL FROM ITS PLACE SHE HELD
IT UP GAZED AT IT LONG AND THEN SHE THREW IT OVER HER OWN HEAD AND
TURNED TO THE MIRROR
AT THAT MOMENT I SAW THE REFLECTION OF THE VISAGE
AND FEATURES QUITE DISTINCTLY IN THE DARK OBLONG GLASS
AND HOW WERE THEY
FEARFUL AND GHASTLY TO ME OH SIR I NEVER SAW A FACE LIKE IT IT WAS
A DISCOLOURED FACE IT WAS A SAVAGE FACE
I WISH I COULD FORGET THE ROLL
OF THE RED EYES AND THE FEARFUL BLACKENED INFLATION OF THE LINEAMENTS
GHOSTS ARE USUALLY PALE JANE
THIS SIR WAS PURPLE THE LIPS WERE SWELLED AND DARK THE BROW
FURROWED THE BLACK EYEBROWS WIDELY RAISED OVER THE BLOODSHOT EYES
SHALL
I TELL YOU OF WHAT IT REMINDED ME
YOU MAY
OF THE FOUL GERMAN SPECTRE THE VAMPYRE
AH WHAT DID IT DO
SIR IT REMOVED MY VEIL FROM ITS GAUNT HEAD RENT IT IN TWO PARTS AND
FLINGING BOTH ON THE FLOOR TRAMPLED ON THEM
IT REMOVED MY VEIL FROM ITS GAUNT HEAD RENT IT IN TWO PARTS AND
FLINGING BOTH ON THE FLOOR TRAMPLED ON THEM P272 JPG
AFTERWARDS
IT DREW ASIDE THE WINDOW CURTAIN AND LOOKED OUT PERHAPS IT SAW DAWN
APPROACHING FOR TAKING THE CANDLE IT RETREATED TO THE DOOR
JUST AT
MY BEDSIDE THE FIGURE STOPPED THE FIERY EYES GLARED UPON ME SHE THRUST
UP HER CANDLE CLOSE TO MY FACE AND EXTINGUISHED IT UNDER MY EYES
I WAS
AWARE HER LURID VISAGE FLAMED OVER MINE AND I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FOR
THE SECOND TIME IN MY LIFE ONLY THE SECOND TIME I BECAME INSENSIBLE
FROM TERROR
WHO WAS WITH YOU WHEN YOU REVIVED
NO ONE SIR BUT THE BROAD DAY
I ROSE BATHED MY HEAD AND FACE IN
WATER DRANK A LONG DRAUGHT FELT THAT THOUGH ENFEEBLED I WAS NOT ILL
AND DETERMINED THAT TO NONE BUT YOU WOULD I IMPART THIS VISION
NOW
SIR TELL ME WHO AND WHAT THAT WOMAN WAS
THE CREATURE OF AN OVER STIMULATED BRAIN THAT IS CERTAIN
I MUST BE
CAREFUL OF YOU MY TREASURE NERVES LIKE YOURS WERE NOT MADE FOR ROUGH
HANDLING
SIR DEPEND ON IT MY NERVES WERE NOT IN FAULT THE THING WAS REAL THE
TRANSACTION ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE
AND YOUR PREVIOUS DREAMS WERE THEY REAL TOO IS THORNFIELD HALL A
RUIN AM I SEVERED FROM YOU BY INSUPERABLE OBSTACLES AM I LEAVING YOU
WITHOUT A TEAR WITHOUT A KISS WITHOUT A WORD
NOT YET
AM I ABOUT TO DO IT WHY THE DAY IS ALREADY COMMENCED WHICH IS TO BIND
US INDISSOLUBLY AND WHEN WE ARE ONCE UNITED THERE SHALL BE NO
RECURRENCE OF THESE MENTAL TERRORS I GUARANTEE THAT
MENTAL TERRORS SIR I WISH I COULD BELIEVE THEM TO BE ONLY SUCH I
WISH IT MORE NOW THAN EVER SINCE EVEN YOU CANNOT EXPLAIN TO ME THE
MYSTERY OF THAT AWFUL VISITANT
AND SINCE I CANNOT DO IT JANE IT MUST HAVE BEEN UNREAL
BUT SIR WHEN I SAID SO TO MYSELF ON RISING THIS MORNING AND WHEN I
LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM TO GATHER COURAGE AND COMFORT FROM THE CHEERFUL
ASPECT OF EACH FAMILIAR OBJECT IN FULL DAYLIGHT THERE ON THE CARPET I
SAW WHAT GAVE THE DISTINCT LIE TO MY HYPOTHESIS THE VEIL TORN FROM TOP
TO BOTTOM IN TWO HALVES
I FELT MR
ROCHESTER START AND SHUDDER HE HASTILY FLUNG HIS ARMS ROUND
ME
THANK GOD HE EXCLAIMED THAT IF ANYTHING MALIGNANT DID COME NEAR
YOU LAST NIGHT IT WAS ONLY THE VEIL THAT WAS HARMED
OH TO THINK WHAT
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED
HE DREW HIS BREATH SHORT AND STRAINED ME SO CLOSE TO HIM I COULD
SCARCELY PANT
AFTER SOME MINUTES' SILENCE HE CONTINUED CHEERILY
NOW JANET I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU ALL ABOUT IT
IT WAS HALF DREAM HALF
REALITY
A WOMAN DID I DOUBT NOT ENTER YOUR ROOM AND THAT WOMAN
WAS MUST HAVE BEEN GRACE POOLE
YOU CALL HER A STRANGE BEING YOURSELF
FROM ALL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE REASON SO TO CALL HER WHAT DID SHE DO TO ME
WHAT TO MASON IN A STATE BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING YOU NOTICED HER
ENTRANCE AND HER ACTIONS BUT FEVERISH ALMOST DELIRIOUS AS YOU WERE YOU
ASCRIBED TO HER A GOBLIN APPEARANCE DIFFERENT FROM HER OWN THE LONG
DISHEVELLED HAIR THE SWELLED BLACK FACE THE EXAGGERATED STATURE WERE
FIGMENTS OF IMAGINATION RESULTS OF NIGHTMARE THE SPITEFUL TEARING OF
THE VEIL WAS REAL AND IT IS LIKE HER
I SEE YOU WOULD ASK WHY I KEEP
SUCH A WOMAN IN MY HOUSE WHEN WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED A YEAR AND A DAY I
WILL TELL YOU BUT NOT NOW
ARE YOU SATISFIED JANE DO YOU ACCEPT MY
SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERY
I REFLECTED AND IN TRUTH IT APPEARED TO ME THE ONLY POSSIBLE ONE
SATISFIED I WAS NOT BUT TO PLEASE HIM I ENDEAVOURED TO APPEAR
SO RELIEVED I CERTAINLY DID FEEL SO I ANSWERED HIM WITH A CONTENTED
SMILE
AND NOW AS IT WAS LONG PAST ONE I PREPARED TO LEAVE HIM
DOES NOT SOPHIE SLEEP WITH ADELE IN THE NURSERY HE ASKED AS I LIT MY
CANDLE
YES SIR
AND THERE IS ROOM ENOUGH IN ADELE'S LITTLE BED FOR YOU

IT WITH HER TO NIGHT JANE IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE INCIDENT YOU HAVE
RELATED SHOULD MAKE YOU NERVOUS AND I WOULD RATHER YOU DID NOT SLEEP
ALONE PROMISE ME TO GO TO THE NURSERY
I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO DO SO SIR
AND FASTEN THE DOOR SECURELY ON THE INSIDE
WAKE SOPHIE WHEN YOU GO
UPSTAIRS UNDER PRETENCE OF REQUESTING HER TO ROUSE YOU IN GOOD TIME TO
MORROW FOR YOU MUST BE DRESSED AND HAVE FINISHED BREAKFAST BEFORE EIGHT
AND NOW NO MORE SOMBRE THOUGHTS CHASE DULL CARE AWAY JANET
DON'T YOU
HEAR TO WHAT SOFT WHISPERS THE WIND HAS FALLEN AND THERE IS NO MORE
BEATING OF RAIN AGAINST THE WINDOW PANES LOOK HERE HE LIFTED UP THE
CURTAIN IT IS A LOVELY NIGHT
IT WAS
HALF HEAVEN WAS PURE AND STAINLESS THE CLOUDS NOW TROOPING
BEFORE THE WIND WHICH HAD SHIFTED TO THE WEST WERE FILING OFF EASTWARD
IN LONG SILVERED COLUMNS
THE MOON SHONE PEACEFULLY
WELL SAID MR
ROCHESTER GAZING INQUIRINGLY INTO MY EYES HOW IS MY
JANET NOW
THE NIGHT IS SERENE SIR AND SO AM I
AND YOU WILL NOT DREAM OF SEPARATION AND SORROW TO NIGHT BUT OF HAPPY
LOVE AND BLISSFUL UNION
THIS PREDICTION WAS BUT HALF FULFILLED I DID NOT INDEED DREAM OF SORROW
BUT AS LITTLE DID I DREAM OF JOY FOR I NEVER SLEPT AT ALL
WITH LITTLE
ADELE IN MY ARMS I WATCHED THE SLUMBER OF CHILDHOOD SO TRANQUIL SO
PASSIONLESS SO INNOCENT AND WAITED FOR THE COMING DAY ALL MY LIFE WAS
AWAKE AND ASTIR IN MY FRAME AND AS SOON AS THE SUN ROSE I ROSE TOO
I
REMEMBER ADELE CLUNG TO ME AS I LEFT HER I REMEMBER I KISSED HER AS I
LOOSENED HER LITTLE HANDS FROM MY NECK AND I CRIED OVER HER WITH STRANGE
EMOTION AND QUITTED HER BECAUSE I FEARED MY SOBS WOULD BREAK HER STILL
SOUND REPOSE
SHE SEEMED THE EMBLEM OF MY PAST LIFE AND HERE I WAS NOW
TO ARRAY MYSELF TO MEET THE DREAD BUT ADORED TYPE OF MY UNKNOWN FUTURE
DAY
CHAPTER XXVI
SOPHIE CAME AT SEVEN TO DRESS ME SHE WAS VERY LONG INDEED IN
ACCOMPLISHING HER TASK SO LONG THAT MR
ROCHESTER GROWN I SUPPOSE
IMPATIENT OF MY DELAY SENT UP TO ASK WHY I DID NOT COME
SHE WAS JUST
FASTENING MY VEIL THE PLAIN SQUARE OF BLOND AFTER ALL TO MY HAIR WITH A
BROOCH I HURRIED FROM UNDER HER HANDS AS SOON AS I COULD
STOP SHE CRIED IN FRENCH
LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR YOU HAVE
NOT TAKEN ONE PEEP
SO I TURNED AT THE DOOR I SAW A ROBED AND VEILED FIGURE SO UNLIKE MY
USUAL SELF THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST THE IMAGE OF A STRANGER
JANE CALLED
A VOICE AND I HASTENED DOWN
I WAS RECEIVED AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
BY MR
ROCHESTER
LINGERER HE SAID MY BRAIN IS ON FIRE WITH IMPATIENCE AND YOU TARRY
SO LONG
HE TOOK ME INTO THE DINING ROOM SURVEYED ME KEENLY ALL OVER PRONOUNCED
ME FAIR AS A LILY AND NOT ONLY THE PRIDE OF HIS LIFE BUT THE DESIRE OF
HIS EYES AND THEN TELLING ME HE WOULD GIVE ME BUT TEN MINUTES TO EAT
SOME BREAKFAST HE RANG THE BELL
ONE OF HIS LATELY HIRED SERVANTS A
FOOTMAN ANSWERED IT
IS JOHN GETTING THE CARRIAGE READY
YES SIR
IS THE LUGGAGE BROUGHT DOWN
THEY ARE BRINGING IT DOWN SIR
GO YOU TO THE CHURCH SEE IF MR
WOOD THE CLERGYMAN AND THE CLERK ARE
THERE RETURN AND TELL ME
THE CHURCH AS THE READER KNOWS WAS BUT JUST BEYOND THE GATES THE
FOOTMAN SOON RETURNED
MR
WOOD IS IN THE VESTRY SIR PUTTING ON HIS SURPLICE
AND THE CARRIAGE
THE HORSES ARE HARNESSING
WE SHALL NOT WANT IT TO GO TO CHURCH BUT IT MUST BE READY THE MOMENT WE
RETURN ALL THE BOXES AND LUGGAGE ARRANGED AND STRAPPED ON AND THE
COACHMAN IN HIS SEAT
YES SIR
JANE ARE YOU READY
I ROSE
THERE WERE NO GROOMSMEN NO BRIDESMAIDS NO RELATIVES TO WAIT
FOR OR MARSHAL NONE BUT MR
ROCHESTER AND I
MRS
FAIRFAX STOOD IN THE
HALL AS WE PASSED
I WOULD FAIN HAVE SPOKEN TO HER BUT MY HAND WAS
HELD BY A GRASP OF IRON I WAS HURRIED ALONG BY A STRIDE I COULD HARDLY
FOLLOW AND TO LOOK AT MR
ROCHESTER'S FACE WAS TO FEEL THAT NOT A SECOND
OF DELAY WOULD BE TOLERATED FOR ANY PURPOSE
I WONDER WHAT OTHER
BRIDEGROOM EVER LOOKED AS HE DID SO BENT UP TO A PURPOSE SO GRIMLY
RESOLUTE OR WHO UNDER SUCH STEADFAST BROWS EVER REVEALED SUCH FLAMING
AND FLASHING EYES
I KNOW NOT WHETHER THE DAY WAS FAIR OR FOUL IN DESCENDING THE DRIVE I
GAZED NEITHER ON SKY NOR EARTH MY HEART WAS WITH MY EYES AND BOTH
SEEMED MIGRATED INTO MR
ROCHESTER'S FRAME
I WANTED TO SEE THE
INVISIBLE THING ON WHICH AS WE WENT ALONG HE APPEARED TO FASTEN A
GLANCE FIERCE AND FELL
I WANTED TO FEEL THE THOUGHTS WHOSE FORCE HE
SEEMED BREASTING AND RESISTING
AT THE CHURCHYARD WICKET HE STOPPED HE DISCOVERED I WAS QUITE OUT OF
BREATH
AM I CRUEL IN MY LOVE HE SAID
DELAY AN INSTANT LEAN ON
ME JANE
AND NOW I CAN RECALL THE PICTURE OF THE GREY OLD HOUSE OF GOD RISING CALM
BEFORE ME OF A ROOK WHEELING ROUND THE STEEPLE OF A RUDDY MORNING SKY
BEYOND
I REMEMBER SOMETHING TOO OF THE GREEN GRAVE MOUNDS AND I HAVE
NOT FORGOTTEN EITHER TWO FIGURES OF STRANGERS STRAYING AMONGST THE LOW
HILLOCKS AND READING THE MEMENTOES GRAVEN ON THE FEW MOSSY HEAD STONES
I
NOTICED THEM BECAUSE AS THEY SAW US THEY PASSED ROUND TO THE BACK OF
THE CHURCH AND I DOUBTED NOT THEY WERE GOING TO ENTER BY THE SIDE AISLE
DOOR AND WITNESS THE CEREMONY
BY MR
ROCHESTER THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED
HE WAS EARNESTLY LOOKING AT MY FACE FROM WHICH THE BLOOD HAD I DARESAY
MOMENTARILY FLED FOR I FELT MY FOREHEAD DEWY AND MY CHEEKS AND LIPS
COLD
WHEN I RALLIED WHICH I SOON DID HE WALKED GENTLY WITH ME UP THE
PATH TO THE PORCH
WE ENTERED THE QUIET AND HUMBLE TEMPLE THE PRIEST WAITED IN HIS WHITE
SURPLICE AT THE LOWLY ALTAR THE CLERK BESIDE HIM
ALL WAS STILL TWO
SHADOWS ONLY MOVED IN A REMOTE CORNER
MY CONJECTURE HAD BEEN CORRECT
THE STRANGERS HAD SLIPPED IN BEFORE US AND THEY NOW STOOD BY THE VAULT
OF THE ROCHESTERS THEIR BACKS TOWARDS US VIEWING THROUGH THE RAILS THE
OLD TIME STAINED MARBLE TOMB WHERE A KNEELING ANGEL GUARDED THE REMAINS
OF DAMER DE ROCHESTER SLAIN AT MARSTON MOOR IN THE TIME OF THE CIVIL
WARS AND OF ELIZABETH HIS WIFE
OUR PLACE WAS TAKEN AT THE COMMUNION RAILS
HEARING A CAUTIOUS STEP
BEHIND ME I GLANCED OVER MY SHOULDER ONE OF THE STRANGERS A GENTLEMAN
EVIDENTLY WAS ADVANCING UP THE CHANCEL
THE SERVICE BEGAN
THE
EXPLANATION OF THE INTENT OF MATRIMONY WAS GONE THROUGH AND THEN THE
CLERGYMAN CAME A STEP FURTHER FORWARD AND BENDING SLIGHTLY TOWARDS MR
ROCHESTER WENT ON
I REQUIRE AND CHARGE YOU BOTH AS YE WILL ANSWER AT THE DREADFUL DAY OF
JUDGMENT WHEN THE SECRETS OF ALL HEARTS SHALL BE DISCLOSED THAT IF
EITHER OF YOU KNOW ANY IMPEDIMENT WHY YE MAY NOT LAWFULLY BE JOINED
TOGETHER IN MATRIMONY YE DO NOW CONFESS IT FOR BE YE WELL ASSURED THAT
SO MANY AS ARE COUPLED TOGETHER OTHERWISE THAN GOD'S WORD DOTH ALLOW ARE
NOT JOINED TOGETHER BY GOD NEITHER IS THEIR MATRIMONY LAWFUL
HE PAUSED AS THE CUSTOM IS
WHEN IS THE PAUSE AFTER THAT SENTENCE EVER
BROKEN BY REPLY NOT PERHAPS ONCE IN A HUNDRED YEARS
AND THE
CLERGYMAN WHO HAD NOT LIFTED HIS EYES FROM HIS BOOK AND HAD HELD HIS
BREATH BUT FOR A MOMENT WAS PROCEEDING HIS HAND WAS ALREADY STRETCHED
TOWARDS MR
ROCHESTER AS HIS LIPS UNCLOSED TO ASK WILT THOU HAVE THIS
WOMAN FOR THY WEDDED WIFE WHEN A DISTINCT AND NEAR VOICE SAID
THE MARRIAGE CANNOT GO ON I DECLARE THE EXISTENCE OF AN IMPEDIMENT
THE CLERGYMAN LOOKED UP AT THE SPEAKER AND STOOD MUTE THE CLERK DID THE
SAME MR
ROCHESTER MOVED SLIGHTLY AS IF AN EARTHQUAKE HAD ROLLED UNDER
HIS FEET TAKING A FIRMER FOOTING AND NOT TURNING HIS HEAD OR EYES HE
SAID PROCEED
PROFOUND SILENCE FELL WHEN HE HAD UTTERED THAT WORD WITH DEEP BUT LOW
INTONATION
PRESENTLY MR
WOOD SAID
I CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT SOME INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT HAS BEEN ASSERTED
AND EVIDENCE OF ITS TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD
THE CEREMONY IS QUITE BROKEN OFF SUBJOINED THE VOICE BEHIND US
I AM
IN A CONDITION TO PROVE MY ALLEGATION AN INSUPERABLE IMPEDIMENT TO THIS
MARRIAGE EXISTS
MR
ROCHESTER HEARD BUT HEEDED NOT HE STOOD STUBBORN AND RIGID MAKING
NO MOVEMENT BUT TO POSSESS HIMSELF OF MY HAND
WHAT A HOT AND STRONG
GRASP HE HAD AND HOW LIKE QUARRIED MARBLE WAS HIS PALE FIRM MASSIVE
FRONT AT THIS MOMENT HOW HIS EYE SHONE STILL WATCHFUL AND YET WILD
BENEATH
MR
WOOD SEEMED AT A LOSS
WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE IMPEDIMENT HE
ASKED
PERHAPS IT MAY BE GOT OVER EXPLAINED AWAY
HARDLY WAS THE ANSWER
I HAVE CALLED IT INSUPERABLE AND I SPEAK
ADVISEDLY
THE SPEAKER CAME FORWARD AND LEANED ON THE RAILS
HE CONTINUED UTTERING
EACH WORD DISTINCTLY CALMLY STEADILY BUT NOT LOUDLY
IT SIMPLY CONSISTS IN THE EXISTENCE OF A PREVIOUS MARRIAGE
MR
ROCHESTER HAS A WIFE NOW LIVING
MY NERVES VIBRATED TO THOSE LOW SPOKEN WORDS AS THEY HAD NEVER VIBRATED
TO THUNDER MY BLOOD FELT THEIR SUBTLE VIOLENCE AS IT HAD NEVER FELT
FROST OR FIRE BUT I WAS COLLECTED AND IN NO DANGER OF SWOONING
I
LOOKED AT MR
ROCHESTER I MADE HIM LOOK AT ME
HIS WHOLE FACE WAS
COLOURLESS ROCK HIS EYE WAS BOTH SPARK AND FLINT
HE DISAVOWED NOTHING
HE SEEMED AS IF HE WOULD DEFY ALL THINGS
WITHOUT SPEAKING WITHOUT
SMILING WITHOUT SEEMING TO RECOGNISE IN ME A HUMAN BEING HE ONLY TWINED
MY WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND RIVETED ME TO HIS SIDE
WHO ARE YOU HE ASKED OF THE INTRUDER
MY NAME IS BRIGGS A SOLICITOR OF STREET LONDON

RECOGNISES IF YOU DO NOT

THEM BEHIND HER WITH MORE ROPE WHICH WAS AT HAND HE BOUND HER TO A
CHAIR

FURTHER ORDER TO GRACE POOLE
THE SOLICITOR ADDRESSED ME AS HE DESCENDED
THE STAIR
YOU MADAM SAID HE ARE CLEARED FROM ALL BLAME YOUR UNCLE WILL BE
GLAD TO HEAR IT IF INDEED HE SHOULD BE STILL LIVING WHEN MR
MASON
RETURNS TO MADEIRA
MY UNCLE WHAT OF HIM DO YOU KNOW HIM
MR
MASON DOES
MR
EYRE HAS BEEN THE FUNCHAL CORRESPONDENT OF HIS
HOUSE FOR SOME YEARS
WHEN YOUR UNCLE RECEIVED YOUR LETTER INTIMATING
THE CONTEMPLATED UNION BETWEEN YOURSELF AND MR
ROCHESTER MR
MASON WHO
WAS STAYING AT MADEIRA TO RECRUIT HIS HEALTH ON HIS WAY BACK TO JAMAICA
HAPPENED TO BE WITH HIM
MR
EYRE MENTIONED THE INTELLIGENCE FOR HE
KNEW THAT MY CLIENT HERE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH A GENTLEMAN OF THE NAME OF
ROCHESTER
MR
MASON ASTONISHED AND DISTRESSED AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
REVEALED THE REAL STATE OF MATTERS
YOUR UNCLE I AM SORRY TO SAY IS
NOW ON A SICK BED FROM WHICH CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF HIS
DISEASE DECLINE AND THE STAGE IT HAS REACHED IT IS UNLIKELY HE WILL
EVER RISE
HE COULD NOT THEN HASTEN TO ENGLAND HIMSELF TO EXTRICATE YOU
FROM THE SNARE INTO WHICH YOU HAD FALLEN BUT HE IMPLORED MR
MASON TO
LOSE NO TIME IN TAKING STEPS TO PREVENT THE FALSE MARRIAGE
HE REFERRED
HIM TO ME FOR ASSISTANCE
I USED ALL DESPATCH AND AM THANKFUL I WAS NOT
TOO LATE AS YOU DOUBTLESS MUST BE ALSO
WERE I NOT MORALLY CERTAIN
THAT YOUR UNCLE WILL BE DEAD ERE YOU REACH MADEIRA I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO
ACCOMPANY MR
MASON BACK BUT AS IT IS I THINK YOU HAD BETTER REMAIN IN
ENGLAND TILL YOU CAN HEAR FURTHER EITHER FROM OR OF MR
EYRE
HAVE WE
ANYTHING ELSE TO STAY FOR HE INQUIRED OF MR
MASON
NO NO LET US BE GONE WAS THE ANXIOUS REPLY AND WITHOUT WAITING TO
TAKE LEAVE OF MR
ROCHESTER THEY MADE THEIR EXIT AT THE HALL DOOR
THE
CLERGYMAN STAYED TO EXCHANGE A FEW SENTENCES EITHER OF ADMONITION OR
REPROOF WITH HIS HAUGHTY PARISHIONER THIS DUTY DONE HE TOO DEPARTED
I HEARD HIM GO AS I STOOD AT THE HALF OPEN DOOR OF MY OWN ROOM TO WHICH
I HAD NOW WITHDRAWN
THE HOUSE CLEARED I SHUT MYSELF IN FASTENED THE
BOLT THAT NONE MIGHT INTRUDE AND PROCEEDED NOT TO WEEP NOT TO MOURN I
WAS YET TOO CALM FOR THAT BUT MECHANICALLY TO TAKE OFF THE WEDDING
DRESS AND REPLACE IT BY THE STUFF GOWN I HAD WORN YESTERDAY AS I
THOUGHT FOR THE LAST TIME
I THEN SAT DOWN I FELT WEAK AND TIRED
I
LEANED MY ARMS ON A TABLE AND MY HEAD DROPPED ON THEM
AND NOW I
THOUGHT TILL NOW I HAD ONLY HEARD SEEN MOVED FOLLOWED UP AND DOWN
WHERE I WAS LED OR DRAGGED WATCHED EVENT RUSH ON EVENT DISCLOSURE OPEN
BEYOND DISCLOSURE BUT NOW I THOUGHT
THE MORNING HAD BEEN A QUIET MORNING ENOUGH ALL EXCEPT THE BRIEF SCENE
WITH THE LUNATIC THE TRANSACTION IN THE CHURCH HAD NOT BEEN NOISY THERE
WAS NO EXPLOSION OF PASSION NO LOUD ALTERCATION NO DISPUTE NO DEFIANCE
OR CHALLENGE NO TEARS NO SOBS A FEW WORDS HAD BEEN SPOKEN A CALMLY
PRONOUNCED OBJECTION TO THE MARRIAGE MADE SOME STERN SHORT QUESTIONS
PUT BY MR
ROCHESTER ANSWERS EXPLANATIONS GIVEN EVIDENCE ADDUCED AN
OPEN ADMISSION OF THE TRUTH HAD BEEN UTTERED BY MY MASTER THEN THE
LIVING PROOF HAD BEEN SEEN THE INTRUDERS WERE GONE AND ALL WAS OVER
I WAS IN MY OWN ROOM AS USUAL JUST MYSELF WITHOUT OBVIOUS CHANGE
NOTHING HAD SMITTEN ME OR SCATHED ME OR MAIMED ME
AND YET WHERE WAS
THE JANE EYRE OF YESTERDAY WHERE WAS HER LIFE WHERE WERE HER
PROSPECTS
JANE EYRE WHO HAD BEEN AN ARDENT EXPECTANT WOMAN ALMOST A BRIDE WAS A
COLD SOLITARY GIRL AGAIN HER LIFE WAS PALE HER PROSPECTS WERE
DESOLATE
A CHRISTMAS FROST HAD COME AT MIDSUMMER A WHITE DECEMBER
STORM HAD WHIRLED OVER JUNE ICE GLAZED THE RIPE APPLES DRIFTS CRUSHED
THE BLOWING ROSES ON HAYFIELD AND CORNFIELD LAY A FROZEN SHROUD LANES
WHICH LAST NIGHT BLUSHED FULL OF FLOWERS TO DAY WERE PATHLESS WITH
UNTRODDEN SNOW AND THE WOODS WHICH TWELVE HOURS SINCE WAVED LEAFY AND
FLAGRANT AS GROVES BETWEEN THE TROPICS NOW SPREAD WASTE WILD AND
WHITE AS PINE FORESTS IN WINTRY NORWAY
MY HOPES WERE ALL DEAD STRUCK
WITH A SUBTLE DOOM SUCH AS IN ONE NIGHT FELL ON ALL THE FIRST BORN IN
THE LAND OF EGYPT
I LOOKED ON MY CHERISHED WISHES YESTERDAY SO
BLOOMING AND GLOWING THEY LAY STARK CHILL LIVID CORPSES THAT COULD
NEVER REVIVE
I LOOKED AT MY LOVE THAT FEELING WHICH WAS MY
MASTER'S WHICH HE HAD CREATED IT SHIVERED IN MY HEART LIKE A SUFFERING
CHILD IN A COLD CRADLE SICKNESS AND ANGUISH HAD SEIZED IT IT COULD NOT
SEEK MR
ROCHESTER'S ARMS IT COULD NOT DERIVE WARMTH FROM HIS BREAST
OH NEVER MORE COULD IT TURN TO HIM FOR FAITH WAS BLIGHTED CONFIDENCE
DESTROYED MR
ROCHESTER WAS NOT TO ME WHAT HE HAD BEEN FOR HE WAS NOT
WHAT I HAD THOUGHT HIM
I WOULD NOT ASCRIBE VICE TO HIM I WOULD NOT SAY
HE HAD BETRAYED ME BUT THE ATTRIBUTE OF STAINLESS TRUTH WAS GONE FROM
HIS IDEA AND FROM HIS PRESENCE I MUST GO THAT I PERCEIVED WELL
WHEN HOW WHITHER I COULD NOT YET DISCERN BUT HE HIMSELF I DOUBTED
NOT WOULD HURRY ME FROM THORNFIELD
REAL AFFECTION IT SEEMED HE COULD
NOT HAVE FOR ME IT HAD BEEN ONLY FITFUL PASSION THAT WAS BALKED HE
WOULD WANT ME NO MORE
I SHOULD FEAR EVEN TO CROSS HIS PATH NOW MY VIEW
MUST BE HATEFUL TO HIM
OH HOW BLIND HAD BEEN MY EYES HOW WEAK MY
CONDUCT
MY EYES WERE COVERED AND CLOSED EDDYING DARKNESS SEEMED TO SWIM ROUND
ME AND REFLECTION CAME IN AS BLACK AND CONFUSED A FLOW
SELF ABANDONED
RELAXED AND EFFORTLESS I SEEMED TO HAVE LAID ME DOWN IN THE DRIED UP
BED OF A GREAT RIVER I HEARD A FLOOD LOOSENED IN REMOTE MOUNTAINS AND
FELT THE TORRENT COME TO RISE I HAD NO WILL TO FLEE I HAD NO STRENGTH
I LAY FAINT LONGING TO BE DEAD
ONE IDEA ONLY STILL THROBBED LIFE LIKE
WITHIN ME A REMEMBRANCE OF GOD IT BEGOT AN UNUTTERED PRAYER THESE
WORDS WENT WANDERING UP AND DOWN IN MY RAYLESS MIND AS SOMETHING THAT
SHOULD BE WHISPERED BUT NO ENERGY WAS FOUND TO EXPRESS THEM
BE NOT FAR FROM ME FOR TROUBLE IS NEAR THERE IS NONE TO HELP
IT WAS NEAR AND AS I HAD LIFTED NO PETITION TO HEAVEN TO AVERT IT AS I
HAD NEITHER JOINED MY HANDS NOR BENT MY KNEES NOR MOVED MY LIPS IT
CAME IN FULL HEAVY SWING THE TORRENT POURED OVER ME
THE WHOLE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY LIFE LORN MY LOVE LOST MY HOPE QUENCHED MY FAITH
DEATH STRUCK SWAYED FULL AND MIGHTY ABOVE ME IN ONE SULLEN MASS
THAT
BITTER HOUR CANNOT BE DESCRIBED IN TRUTH THE WATERS CAME INTO MY SOUL
I SANK IN DEEP MIRE I FELT NO STANDING I CAME INTO DEEP WATERS THE
FLOODS OVERFLOWED ME
CHAPTER XXVII
SOME TIME IN THE AFTERNOON I RAISED MY HEAD AND LOOKING ROUND AND SEEING
THE WESTERN SUN GILDING THE SIGN OF ITS DECLINE ON THE WALL I ASKED
WHAT AM I TO DO
BUT THE ANSWER MY MIND GAVE LEAVE THORNFIELD AT ONCE WAS SO PROMPT
SO DREAD THAT I STOPPED MY EARS
I SAID I COULD NOT BEAR SUCH WORDS
NOW
THAT I AM NOT EDWARD ROCHESTER'S BRIDE IS THE LEAST PART OF MY
WOE I ALLEGED THAT I HAVE WAKENED OUT OF MOST GLORIOUS DREAMS AND
FOUND THEM ALL VOID AND VAIN IS A HORROR I COULD BEAR AND MASTER BUT
THAT I MUST LEAVE HIM DECIDEDLY INSTANTLY ENTIRELY IS INTOLERABLE
I
CANNOT DO IT
BUT THEN A VOICE WITHIN ME AVERRED THAT I COULD DO IT AND FORETOLD THAT
I SHOULD DO IT
I WRESTLED WITH MY OWN RESOLUTION I WANTED TO BE WEAK
THAT I MIGHT AVOID THE AWFUL PASSAGE OF FURTHER SUFFERING I SAW LAID OUT
FOR ME AND CONSCIENCE TURNED TYRANT HELD PASSION BY THE THROAT TOLD
HER TAUNTINGLY SHE HAD YET BUT DIPPED HER DAINTY FOOT IN THE SLOUGH AND
SWORE THAT WITH THAT ARM OF IRON HE WOULD THRUST HER DOWN TO UNSOUNDED
DEPTHS OF AGONY
LET ME BE TORN AWAY THEN I CRIED
LET ANOTHER HELP ME
NO YOU SHALL TEAR YOURSELF AWAY NONE SHALL HELP YOU YOU SHALL
YOURSELF PLUCK OUT YOUR RIGHT EYE YOURSELF CUT OFF YOUR RIGHT HAND YOUR
HEART SHALL BE THE VICTIM AND YOU THE PRIEST TO TRANSFIX IT
I ROSE UP SUDDENLY TERROR STRUCK AT THE SOLITUDE WHICH SO RUTHLESS A
JUDGE HAUNTED AT THE SILENCE WHICH SO AWFUL A VOICE FILLED
MY HEAD
SWAM AS I STOOD ERECT
I PERCEIVED THAT I WAS SICKENING FROM EXCITEMENT
AND INANITION NEITHER MEAT NOR DRINK HAD PASSED MY LIPS THAT DAY FOR I
HAD TAKEN NO BREAKFAST
AND WITH A STRANGE PANG I NOW REFLECTED THAT
LONG AS I HAD BEEN SHUT UP HERE NO MESSAGE HAD BEEN SENT TO ASK HOW I
WAS OR TO INVITE ME TO COME DOWN NOT EVEN LITTLE ADELE HAD TAPPED AT
THE DOOR NOT EVEN MRS
FAIRFAX HAD SOUGHT ME
FRIENDS ALWAYS FORGET
THOSE WHOM FORTUNE FORSAKES I MURMURED AS I UNDREW THE BOLT AND PASSED
OUT
I STUMBLED OVER AN OBSTACLE MY HEAD WAS STILL DIZZY MY SIGHT WAS
DIM AND MY LIMBS WERE FEEBLE
I COULD NOT SOON RECOVER MYSELF
I FELL
BUT NOT ON TO THE GROUND AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM CAUGHT ME
I LOOKED UP I
WAS SUPPORTED BY MR
ROCHESTER WHO SAT IN A CHAIR ACROSS MY CHAMBER
THRESHOLD
YOU COME OUT AT LAST HE SAID
WELL I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU
LONG AND LISTENING YET NOT ONE MOVEMENT HAVE I HEARD NOR ONE SOB FIVE
MINUTES MORE OF THAT DEATH LIKE HUSH AND I SHOULD HAVE FORCED THE LOCK
LIKE A BURGLAR
SO YOU SHUN ME YOU SHUT YOURSELF UP AND GRIEVE ALONE
I WOULD RATHER YOU HAD COME AND UPBRAIDED ME WITH VEHEMENCE
YOU ARE
PASSIONATE
I EXPECTED A SCENE OF SOME KIND
I WAS PREPARED FOR THE HOT
RAIN OF TEARS ONLY I WANTED THEM TO BE SHED ON MY BREAST NOW A
SENSELESS FLOOR HAS RECEIVED THEM OR YOUR DRENCHED HANDKERCHIEF
BUT I
ERR YOU HAVE NOT WEPT AT ALL I SEE A WHITE CHEEK AND A FADED EYE BUT
NO TRACE OF TEARS
I SUPPOSE THEN YOUR HEART HAS BEEN WEEPING BLOOD
WELL JANE NOT A WORD OF REPROACH NOTHING BITTER NOTHING POIGNANT
NOTHING TO CUT A FEELING OR STING A PASSION YOU SIT QUIETLY WHERE I
HAVE PLACED YOU AND REGARD ME WITH A WEARY PASSIVE LOOK
JANE I NEVER MEANT TO WOUND YOU THUS
IF THE MAN WHO HAD BUT ONE
LITTLE EWE LAMB THAT WAS DEAR TO HIM AS A DAUGHTER THAT ATE OF HIS BREAD
AND DRANK OF HIS CUP AND LAY IN HIS BOSOM HAD BY SOME MISTAKE
SLAUGHTERED IT AT THE SHAMBLES HE WOULD NOT HAVE RUED HIS BLOODY BLUNDER
MORE THAN I NOW RUE MINE
WILL YOU EVER FORGIVE ME
READER I FORGAVE HIM AT THE MOMENT AND ON THE SPOT
THERE WAS SUCH DEEP
REMORSE IN HIS EYE SUCH TRUE PITY IN HIS TONE SUCH MANLY ENERGY IN HIS
MANNER AND BESIDES THERE WAS SUCH UNCHANGED LOVE IN HIS WHOLE LOOK AND
MIEN I FORGAVE HIM ALL YET NOT IN WORDS NOT OUTWARDLY ONLY AT MY
HEART'S CORE
YOU KNOW I AM A SCOUNDREL JANE ERE LONG HE INQUIRED
WISTFULLY WONDERING I SUPPOSE AT MY CONTINUED SILENCE AND TAMENESS
THE RESULT RATHER OF WEAKNESS THAN OF WILL
YES SIR
THEN TELL ME SO ROUNDLY AND SHARPLY DON'T SPARE ME
I CANNOT I AM TIRED AND SICK
I WANT SOME WATER HE HEAVED A SORT OF
SHUDDERING SIGH AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS CARRIED ME DOWNSTAIRS
AT
FIRST I DID NOT KNOW TO WHAT ROOM HE HAD BORNE ME ALL WAS CLOUDY TO MY
GLAZED SIGHT PRESENTLY I FELT THE REVIVING WARMTH OF A FIRE FOR SUMMER
AS IT WAS I HAD BECOME ICY COLD IN MY CHAMBER
HE PUT WINE TO MY LIPS
I TASTED IT AND REVIVED THEN I ATE SOMETHING HE OFFERED ME AND WAS SOON
MYSELF
I WAS IN THE LIBRARY SITTING IN HIS CHAIR HE WAS QUITE NEAR
IF I COULD GO OUT OF LIFE NOW WITHOUT TOO SHARP A PANG IT WOULD BE
WELL FOR ME I THOUGHT THEN I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MAKE THE EFFORT OF
CRACKING MY HEART STRINGS IN RENDING THEM FROM AMONG MR
ROCHESTER'S
I
MUST LEAVE HIM IT APPEARS
I DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE HIM I CANNOT LEAVE
HIM
HOW ARE YOU NOW JANE
MUCH BETTER SIR I SHALL BE WELL SOON
TASTE THE WINE AGAIN JANE
I OBEYED HIM THEN HE PUT THE GLASS ON THE TABLE STOOD BEFORE ME AND
LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
SUDDENLY HE TURNED AWAY WITH AN INARTICULATE
EXCLAMATION FULL OF PASSIONATE EMOTION OF SOME KIND HE WALKED FAST
THROUGH THE ROOM AND CAME BACK HE STOOPED TOWARDS ME AS IF TO KISS ME
BUT I REMEMBERED CARESSES WERE NOW FORBIDDEN
I TURNED MY FACE AWAY AND
PUT HIS ASIDE
WHAT HOW IS THIS HE EXCLAIMED HASTILY
OH I KNOW YOU WON'T KISS
THE HUSBAND OF BERTHA MASON YOU CONSIDER MY ARMS FILLED AND MY EMBRACES
APPROPRIATED
AT ANY RATE THERE IS NEITHER ROOM NOR CLAIM FOR ME SIR
WHY JANE I WILL SPARE YOU THE TROUBLE OF MUCH TALKING I WILL ANSWER
FOR YOU BECAUSE I HAVE A WIFE ALREADY YOU WOULD REPLY I GUESS
RIGHTLY
YES
IF YOU THINK SO YOU MUST HAVE A STRANGE OPINION OF ME YOU MUST REGARD
ME AS A PLOTTING PROFLIGATE A BASE AND LOW RAKE WHO HAS BEEN SIMULATING
DISINTERESTED LOVE IN ORDER TO DRAW YOU INTO A SNARE DELIBERATELY LAID
AND STRIP YOU OF HONOUR AND ROB YOU OF SELF RESPECT
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO
THAT I SEE YOU CAN SAY NOTHING IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU ARE FAINT STILL
AND HAVE ENOUGH TO DO TO DRAW YOUR BREATH IN THE SECOND PLACE YOU
CANNOT YET ACCUSTOM YOURSELF TO ACCUSE AND REVILE ME AND BESIDES THE
FLOOD GATES OF TEARS ARE OPENED AND THEY WOULD RUSH OUT IF YOU SPOKE
MUCH AND YOU HAVE NO DESIRE TO EXPOSTULATE TO UPBRAID TO MAKE A SCENE
YOU ARE THINKING HOW TO ACT TALKING YOU CONSIDER IS OF NO USE
I
KNOW YOU I AM ON MY GUARD
SIR I DO NOT WISH TO ACT AGAINST YOU I SAID AND MY UNSTEADY VOICE
WARNED ME TO CURTAIL MY SENTENCE
NOT IN YOUR SENSE OF THE WORD BUT IN MINE YOU ARE SCHEMING TO DESTROY
ME
YOU HAVE AS GOOD AS SAID THAT I AM A MARRIED MAN AS A MARRIED MAN
YOU WILL SHUN ME KEEP OUT OF MY WAY JUST NOW YOU HAVE REFUSED TO KISS
ME
YOU INTEND TO MAKE YOURSELF A COMPLETE STRANGER TO ME TO LIVE UNDER
THIS ROOF ONLY AS ADELE'S GOVERNESS IF EVER I SAY A FRIENDLY WORD TO
YOU IF EVER A FRIENDLY FEELING INCLINES YOU AGAIN TO ME YOU WILL
SAY 'THAT MAN HAD NEARLY MADE ME HIS MISTRESS I MUST BE ICE AND ROCK
TO HIM AND ICE AND ROCK YOU WILL ACCORDINGLY BECOME
I CLEARED AND STEADIED MY VOICE TO REPLY ALL IS CHANGED ABOUT ME SIR
I MUST CHANGE TOO THERE IS NO DOUBT OF THAT AND TO AVOID FLUCTUATIONS
OF FEELING AND CONTINUAL COMBATS WITH RECOLLECTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY ADELE MUST HAVE A NEW GOVERNESS SIR
OH ADELE WILL GO TO SCHOOL I HAVE SETTLED THAT ALREADY NOR DO I MEAN
TO TORMENT YOU WITH THE HIDEOUS ASSOCIATIONS AND RECOLLECTIONS OF
THORNFIELD HALL THIS ACCURSED PLACE THIS TENT OF ACHAN THIS INSOLENT
VAULT OFFERING THE GHASTLINESS OF LIVING DEATH TO THE LIGHT OF THE OPEN
SKY THIS NARROW STONE HELL WITH ITS ONE REAL FIEND WORSE THAN A LEGION
OF SUCH AS WE IMAGINE
JANE YOU SHALL NOT STAY HERE NOR WILL I
I WAS
WRONG EVER TO BRING YOU TO THORNFIELD HALL KNOWING AS I DID HOW IT WAS
HAUNTED
I CHARGED THEM TO CONCEAL FROM YOU BEFORE I EVER SAW YOU ALL
KNOWLEDGE OF THE CURSE OF THE PLACE MERELY BECAUSE I FEARED ADELE NEVER
WOULD HAVE A GOVERNESS TO STAY IF SHE KNEW WITH WHAT INMATE SHE WAS
HOUSED AND MY PLANS WOULD NOT PERMIT ME TO REMOVE THE MANIAC
ELSEWHERE THOUGH I POSSESS AN OLD HOUSE FERNDEAN MANOR EVEN MORE
RETIRED AND HIDDEN THAN THIS WHERE I COULD HAVE LODGED HER SAFELY
ENOUGH HAD NOT A SCRUPLE ABOUT THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE SITUATION IN
THE HEART OF A WOOD MADE MY CONSCIENCE RECOIL FROM THE ARRANGEMENT
PROBABLY THOSE DAMP WALLS WOULD SOON HAVE EASED ME OF HER CHARGE BUT TO
EACH VILLAIN HIS OWN VICE AND MINE IS NOT A TENDENCY TO INDIRECT
ASSASSINATION EVEN OF WHAT I MOST HATE
CONCEALING THE MAD WOMAN'S NEIGHBOURHOOD FROM YOU HOWEVER WAS
SOMETHING LIKE COVERING A CHILD WITH A CLOAK AND LAYING IT DOWN NEAR A
UPAS TREE THAT DEMON'S VICINAGE IS POISONED AND ALWAYS WAS
BUT I'LL
SHUT UP THORNFIELD HALL I'LL NAIL UP THE FRONT DOOR AND BOARD THE LOWER
WINDOWS I'LL GIVE MRS
POOLE TWO HUNDRED A YEAR TO LIVE HERE WITH MY
WIFE AS YOU TERM THAT FEARFUL HAG GRACE WILL DO MUCH FOR MONEY AND
SHE SHALL HAVE HER SON THE KEEPER AT GRIMSBY RETREAT TO BEAR HER
COMPANY AND BE AT HAND TO GIVE HER AID IN THE PAROXYSMS WHEN MY WIFE
IS PROMPTED BY HER FAMILIAR TO BURN PEOPLE IN THEIR BEDS AT NIGHT TO
STAB THEM TO BITE THEIR FLESH FROM THEIR BONES AND SO ON
SIR I INTERRUPTED HIM YOU ARE INEXORABLE FOR THAT UNFORTUNATE LADY
YOU SPEAK OF HER WITH HATE WITH VINDICTIVE ANTIPATHY
IT IS CRUEL SHE
CANNOT HELP BEING MAD
JANE MY LITTLE DARLING SO I WILL CALL YOU FOR SO YOU ARE YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU MISJUDGE ME AGAIN IT IS NOT BECAUSE
SHE IS MAD I HATE HER
IF YOU WERE MAD DO YOU THINK I SHOULD HATE YOU
I DO INDEED SIR
THEN YOU ARE MISTAKEN AND YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ME AND NOTHING ABOUT
THE SORT OF LOVE OF WHICH I AM CAPABLE
EVERY ATOM OF YOUR FLESH IS AS
DEAR TO ME AS MY OWN IN PAIN AND SICKNESS IT WOULD STILL BE DEAR
YOUR
MIND IS MY TREASURE AND IF IT WERE BROKEN IT WOULD BE MY TREASURE
STILL IF YOU RAVED MY ARMS SHOULD CONFINE YOU AND NOT A STRAIT
WAISTCOAT YOUR GRASP EVEN IN FURY WOULD HAVE A CHARM FOR ME IF YOU
FLEW AT ME AS WILDLY AS THAT WOMAN DID THIS MORNING I SHOULD RECEIVE YOU
IN AN EMBRACE AT LEAST AS FOND AS IT WOULD BE RESTRICTIVE
I SHOULD NOT
SHRINK FROM YOU WITH DISGUST AS I DID FROM HER IN YOUR QUIET MOMENTS YOU
SHOULD HAVE NO WATCHER AND NO NURSE BUT ME AND I COULD HANG OVER YOU
WITH UNTIRING TENDERNESS THOUGH YOU GAVE ME NO SMILE IN RETURN AND
NEVER WEARY OF GAZING INTO YOUR EYES THOUGH THEY HAD NO LONGER A RAY OF
RECOGNITION FOR ME BUT WHY DO I FOLLOW THAT TRAIN OF IDEAS I WAS
TALKING OF REMOVING YOU FROM THORNFIELD
ALL YOU KNOW IS PREPARED FOR
PROMPT DEPARTURE TO MORROW YOU SHALL GO
I ONLY ASK YOU TO ENDURE ONE
MORE NIGHT UNDER THIS ROOF JANE AND THEN FAREWELL TO ITS MISERIES AND
TERRORS FOR EVER I HAVE A PLACE TO REPAIR TO WHICH WILL BE A SECURE
SANCTUARY FROM HATEFUL REMINISCENCES FROM UNWELCOME INTRUSION EVEN FROM
FALSEHOOD AND SLANDER
AND TAKE ADELE WITH YOU SIR I INTERRUPTED SHE WILL BE A COMPANION
FOR YOU
WHAT DO YOU MEAN JANE I TOLD YOU I WOULD SEND ADELE TO SCHOOL AND
WHAT DO I WANT WITH A CHILD FOR A COMPANION AND NOT MY OWN CHILD A
FRENCH DANCER'S BASTARD WHY DO YOU IMPORTUNE ME ABOUT HER I SAY WHY
DO YOU ASSIGN ADELE TO ME FOR A COMPANION
YOU SPOKE OF A RETIREMENT SIR AND RETIREMENT AND SOLITUDE ARE DULL
TOO DULL FOR YOU
SOLITUDE SOLITUDE HE REITERATED WITH IRRITATION
I SEE I MUST COME
TO AN EXPLANATION
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SPHYNX LIKE EXPRESSION IS FORMING
IN YOUR COUNTENANCE
YOU ARE TO SHARE MY SOLITUDE
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
I SHOOK MY HEAD IT REQUIRED A DEGREE OF COURAGE EXCITED AS HE WAS
BECOMING EVEN TO RISK THAT MUTE SIGN OF DISSENT
HE HAD BEEN WALKING
FAST ABOUT THE ROOM AND HE STOPPED AS IF SUDDENLY ROOTED TO ONE SPOT
HE LOOKED AT ME LONG AND HARD I TURNED MY EYES FROM HIM FIXED THEM ON
THE FIRE AND TRIED TO ASSUME AND MAINTAIN A QUIET COLLECTED ASPECT
NOW FOR THE HITCH IN JANE'S CHARACTER HE SAID AT LAST SPEAKING MORE
CALMLY THAN FROM HIS LOOK I HAD EXPECTED HIM TO SPEAK
THE REEL OF SILK
HAS RUN SMOOTHLY ENOUGH SO FAR BUT I ALWAYS KNEW THERE WOULD COME A KNOT
AND A PUZZLE HERE IT IS
NOW FOR VEXATION AND EXASPERATION AND
ENDLESS TROUBLE BY GOD I LONG TO EXERT A FRACTION OF SAMSON'S
STRENGTH AND BREAK THE ENTANGLEMENT LIKE TOW
HE RECOMMENCED HIS WALK BUT SOON AGAIN STOPPED AND THIS TIME JUST
BEFORE ME
JANE WILL YOU HEAR REASON HE STOOPED AND APPROACHED HIS LIPS TO MY
EAR BECAUSE IF YOU WON'T I'LL TRY VIOLENCE HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE
HIS LOOK THAT OF A MAN WHO IS JUST ABOUT TO BURST AN INSUFFERABLE BOND
AND PLUNGE HEADLONG INTO WILD LICENSE
I SAW THAT IN ANOTHER MOMENT AND
WITH ONE IMPETUS OF FRENZY MORE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO NOTHING WITH HIM
THE PRESENT THE PASSING SECOND OF TIME WAS ALL I HAD IN WHICH TO
CONTROL AND RESTRAIN HIM A MOVEMENT OF REPULSION FLIGHT FEAR WOULD
HAVE SEALED MY DOOM AND HIS
BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID NOT IN THE LEAST
I
FELT AN INWARD POWER A SENSE OF INFLUENCE WHICH SUPPORTED ME
THE
CRISIS WAS PERILOUS BUT NOT WITHOUT ITS CHARM SUCH AS THE INDIAN
PERHAPS FEELS WHEN HE SLIPS OVER THE RAPID IN HIS CANOE
I TOOK HOLD OF
HIS CLENCHED HAND LOOSENED THE CONTORTED FINGERS AND SAID TO HIM
SOOTHINGLY
SIT DOWN I'LL TALK TO YOU AS LONG AS YOU LIKE AND HEAR ALL YOU HAVE TO
SAY WHETHER REASONABLE OR UNREASONABLE
HE SAT DOWN BUT HE DID NOT GET LEAVE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY
I HAD BEEN
STRUGGLING WITH TEARS FOR SOME TIME I HAD TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO REPRESS
THEM BECAUSE I KNEW HE WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE ME WEEP
NOW HOWEVER I
CONSIDERED IT WELL TO LET THEM FLOW AS FREELY AND AS LONG AS THEY LIKED
IF THE FLOOD ANNOYED HIM SO MUCH THE BETTER
SO I GAVE WAY AND CRIED
HEARTILY
SOON I HEARD HIM EARNESTLY ENTREATING ME TO BE COMPOSED
I SAID I COULD
NOT WHILE HE WAS IN SUCH A PASSION
BUT I AM NOT ANGRY JANE I ONLY LOVE YOU TOO WELL AND YOU HAD STEELED
YOUR LITTLE PALE FACE WITH SUCH A RESOLUTE FROZEN LOOK I COULD NOT
ENDURE IT
HUSH NOW AND WIPE YOUR EYES
HIS SOFTENED VOICE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS SUBDUED SO I IN MY TURN
BECAME CALM
NOW HE MADE AN EFFORT TO REST HIS HEAD ON MY SHOULDER BUT
I WOULD NOT PERMIT IT
THEN HE WOULD DRAW ME TO HIM NO
JANE JANE HE SAID IN SUCH AN ACCENT OF BITTER SADNESS IT THRILLED
ALONG EVERY NERVE I HAD YOU DON'T LOVE ME THEN IT WAS ONLY MY
STATION AND THE RANK OF MY WIFE THAT YOU VALUED NOW THAT YOU THINK ME
DISQUALIFIED TO BECOME YOUR HUSBAND YOU RECOIL FROM MY TOUCH AS IF I
WERE SOME TOAD OR APE
THESE WORDS CUT ME YET WHAT COULD I DO OR I SAY I OUGHT PROBABLY TO
HAVE DONE OR SAID NOTHING BUT I WAS SO TORTURED BY A SENSE OF REMORSE AT
THUS HURTING HIS FEELINGS I COULD NOT CONTROL THE WISH TO DROP BALM
WHERE I HAD WOUNDED
I DO LOVE YOU I SAID MORE THAN EVER BUT I MUST NOT SHOW OR
INDULGE THE FEELING AND THIS IS THE LAST TIME I MUST EXPRESS IT
THE LAST TIME JANE WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU CAN LIVE WITH ME AND SEE
ME DAILY AND YET IF YOU STILL LOVE ME BE ALWAYS COLD AND DISTANT
NO SIR THAT I AM CERTAIN I COULD NOT AND THEREFORE I SEE THERE IS BUT
ONE WAY BUT YOU WILL BE FURIOUS IF I MENTION IT
OH MENTION IT IF I STORM YOU HAVE THE ART OF WEEPING
MR
ROCHESTER I MUST LEAVE YOU
FOR HOW LONG JANE FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE YOU SMOOTH YOUR HAIR WHICH
IS SOMEWHAT DISHEVELLED AND BATHE YOUR FACE WHICH LOOKS FEVERISH
I MUST LEAVE ADELE AND THORNFIELD
I MUST PART WITH YOU FOR MY WHOLE
LIFE I MUST BEGIN A NEW EXISTENCE AMONG STRANGE FACES AND STRANGE
SCENES
OF COURSE I TOLD YOU YOU SHOULD
I PASS OVER THE MADNESS ABOUT PARTING
FROM ME
YOU MEAN YOU MUST BECOME A PART OF ME
AS TO THE NEW
EXISTENCE IT IS ALL RIGHT YOU SHALL YET BE MY WIFE I AM NOT MARRIED
YOU SHALL BE MRS
ROCHESTER BOTH VIRTUALLY AND NOMINALLY
I SHALL KEEP
ONLY TO YOU SO LONG AS YOU AND I LIVE
YOU SHALL GO TO A PLACE I HAVE IN
THE SOUTH OF FRANCE A WHITEWASHED VILLA ON THE SHORES OF THE
MEDITERRANEAN
THERE YOU SHALL LIVE A HAPPY AND GUARDED AND MOST
INNOCENT LIFE
NEVER FEAR THAT I WISH TO LURE YOU INTO ERROR TO MAKE
YOU MY MISTRESS
WHY DID YOU SHAKE YOUR HEAD JANE YOU MUST BE
REASONABLE OR IN TRUTH I SHALL AGAIN BECOME FRANTIC
HIS VOICE AND HAND QUIVERED HIS LARGE NOSTRILS DILATED HIS EYE BLAZED
STILL I DARED TO SPEAK
SIR YOUR WIFE IS LIVING THAT IS A FACT ACKNOWLEDGED THIS MORNING BY
YOURSELF
IF I LIVED WITH YOU AS YOU DESIRE I SHOULD THEN BE YOUR
MISTRESS TO SAY OTHERWISE IS SOPHISTICAL IS FALSE
JANE I AM NOT A GENTLE TEMPERED MAN YOU FORGET THAT I AM NOT LONG
ENDURING I AM NOT COOL AND DISPASSIONATE
OUT OF PITY TO ME AND
YOURSELF PUT YOUR FINGER ON MY PULSE FEEL HOW IT THROBS AND BEWARE
HE BARED HIS WRIST AND OFFERED IT TO ME THE BLOOD WAS FORSAKING HIS
CHEEK AND LIPS THEY WERE GROWING LIVID I WAS DISTRESSED ON ALL HANDS
TO AGITATE HIM THUS DEEPLY BY A RESISTANCE HE SO ABHORRED WAS CRUEL TO
YIELD WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
I DID WHAT HUMAN BEINGS DO INSTINCTIVELY
WHEN THEY ARE DRIVEN TO UTTER EXTREMITY LOOKED FOR AID TO ONE HIGHER
THAN MAN THE WORDS GOD HELP ME BURST INVOLUNTARILY FROM MY LIPS
I AM A FOOL CRIED MR
ROCHESTER SUDDENLY
I KEEP TELLING HER I AM
NOT MARRIED AND DO NOT EXPLAIN TO HER WHY
I FORGET SHE KNOWS NOTHING
OF THE CHARACTER OF THAT WOMAN OR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING MY
INFERNAL UNION WITH HER
OH I AM CERTAIN JANE WILL AGREE WITH ME IN
OPINION WHEN SHE KNOWS ALL THAT I KNOW JUST PUT YOUR HAND IN MINE
JANET THAT I MAY HAVE THE EVIDENCE OF TOUCH AS WELL AS SIGHT TO PROVE
YOU ARE NEAR ME AND I WILL IN A FEW WORDS SHOW YOU THE REAL STATE OF THE
CASE
CAN YOU LISTEN TO ME
YES SIR FOR HOURS IF YOU WILL
I ASK ONLY MINUTES
JANE DID YOU EVER HEAR OR KNOW THAT I WAS NOT THE
ELDEST SON OF MY HOUSE THAT I HAD ONCE A BROTHER OLDER THAN I
I REMEMBER MRS
FAIRFAX TOLD ME SO ONCE
AND DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT MY FATHER WAS AN AVARICIOUS GRASPING MAN
I HAVE UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT
WELL JANE BEING SO IT WAS HIS RESOLUTION TO KEEP THE PROPERTY
TOGETHER HE COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA OF DIVIDING HIS ESTATE AND LEAVING
ME A FAIR PORTION ALL HE RESOLVED SHOULD GO TO MY BROTHER ROWLAND
YET AS LITTLE COULD HE ENDURE THAT A SON OF HIS SHOULD BE A POOR MAN
I
MUST BE PROVIDED FOR BY A WEALTHY MARRIAGE
HE SOUGHT ME A PARTNER
BETIMES
MR
MASON A WEST INDIA PLANTER AND MERCHANT WAS HIS OLD
ACQUAINTANCE
HE WAS CERTAIN HIS POSSESSIONS WERE REAL AND VAST HE MADE
INQUIRIES
MR
MASON HE FOUND HAD A SON AND DAUGHTER AND HE LEARNED
FROM HIM THAT HE COULD AND WOULD GIVE THE LATTER A FORTUNE OF THIRTY
THOUSAND POUNDS THAT SUFFICED
WHEN I LEFT COLLEGE I WAS SENT OUT TO
JAMAICA TO ESPOUSE A BRIDE ALREADY COURTED FOR ME
MY FATHER SAID
NOTHING ABOUT HER MONEY BUT HE TOLD ME MISS MASON WAS THE BOAST OF
SPANISH TOWN FOR HER BEAUTY AND THIS WAS NO LIE
I FOUND HER A FINE
WOMAN IN THE STYLE OF BLANCHE INGRAM TALL DARK AND MAJESTIC
HER
FAMILY WISHED TO SECURE ME BECAUSE I WAS OF A GOOD RACE AND SO DID SHE
THEY SHOWED HER TO ME IN PARTIES SPLENDIDLY DRESSED
I SELDOM SAW HER
ALONE AND HAD VERY LITTLE PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER
SHE FLATTERED
ME AND LAVISHLY DISPLAYED FOR MY PLEASURE HER CHARMS AND
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
ALL THE MEN IN HER CIRCLE SEEMED TO ADMIRE HER AND ENVY
ME
I WAS DAZZLED STIMULATED MY SENSES WERE EXCITED AND BEING
IGNORANT RAW AND INEXPERIENCED I THOUGHT I LOVED HER
THERE IS NO
FOLLY SO BESOTTED THAT THE IDIOTIC RIVALRIES OF SOCIETY THE PRURIENCE
THE RASHNESS THE BLINDNESS OF YOUTH WILL NOT HURRY A MAN TO ITS
COMMISSION
HER RELATIVES ENCOURAGED ME COMPETITORS PIQUED ME SHE
ALLURED ME A MARRIAGE WAS ACHIEVED ALMOST BEFORE I KNEW WHERE I WAS
OH
I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR MYSELF WHEN I THINK OF THAT ACT AN AGONY OF
INWARD CONTEMPT MASTERS ME
I NEVER LOVED I NEVER ESTEEMED I DID NOT
EVEN KNOW HER
I WAS NOT SURE OF THE EXISTENCE OF ONE VIRTUE IN HER
NATURE I HAD MARKED NEITHER MODESTY NOR BENEVOLENCE NOR CANDOUR NOR
REFINEMENT IN HER MIND OR MANNERS AND I MARRIED HER GROSS
GROVELLING MOLE EYED BLOCKHEAD THAT I WAS WITH LESS SIN I MIGHT
HAVE BUT LET ME REMEMBER TO WHOM I AM SPEAKING
MY BRIDE'S MOTHER I HAD NEVER SEEN I UNDERSTOOD SHE WAS DEAD
THE
HONEYMOON OVER I LEARNED MY MISTAKE SHE WAS ONLY MAD AND SHUT UP IN A
LUNATIC ASYLUM
THERE WAS A YOUNGER BROTHER TOO A COMPLETE DUMB IDIOT
THE ELDER ONE WHOM YOU HAVE SEEN AND WHOM I CANNOT HATE WHILST I ABHOR
ALL HIS KINDRED BECAUSE HE HAS SOME GRAINS OF AFFECTION IN HIS FEEBLE
MIND SHOWN IN THE CONTINUED INTEREST HE TAKES IN HIS WRETCHED SISTER
AND ALSO IN A DOG LIKE ATTACHMENT HE ONCE BORE ME WILL PROBABLY BE IN
THE SAME STATE ONE DAY
MY FATHER AND MY BROTHER ROWLAND KNEW ALL THIS
BUT THEY THOUGHT ONLY OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS AND JOINED IN THE
PLOT AGAINST ME
THESE WERE VILE DISCOVERIES BUT EXCEPT FOR THE TREACHERY OF
CONCEALMENT I SHOULD HAVE MADE THEM NO SUBJECT OF REPROACH TO MY WIFE
EVEN WHEN I FOUND HER NATURE WHOLLY ALIEN TO MINE HER TASTES OBNOXIOUS
TO ME HER CAST OF MIND COMMON LOW NARROW AND SINGULARLY INCAPABLE OF
BEING LED TO ANYTHING HIGHER EXPANDED TO ANYTHING LARGER WHEN I FOUND
THAT I COULD NOT PASS A SINGLE EVENING NOR EVEN A SINGLE HOUR OF THE DAY
WITH HER IN COMFORT THAT KINDLY CONVERSATION COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED
BETWEEN US BECAUSE WHATEVER TOPIC I STARTED IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED FROM
HER A TURN AT ONCE COARSE AND TRITE PERVERSE AND IMBECILE WHEN I
PERCEIVED THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE A QUIET OR SETTLED HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE
NO SERVANT WOULD BEAR THE CONTINUED OUTBREAKS OF HER VIOLENT AND
UNREASONABLE TEMPER OR THE VEXATIONS OF HER ABSURD CONTRADICTORY
EXACTING ORDERS EVEN THEN I RESTRAINED MYSELF I ESCHEWED UPBRAIDING I
CURTAILED REMONSTRANCE I TRIED TO DEVOUR MY REPENTANCE AND DISGUST IN
SECRET I REPRESSED THE DEEP ANTIPATHY I FELT
JANE I WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH ABOMINABLE DETAILS SOME STRONG WORDS
SHALL EXPRESS WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
I LIVED WITH THAT WOMAN UPSTAIRS FOUR
YEARS AND BEFORE THAT TIME SHE HAD TRIED ME INDEED HER CHARACTER
RIPENED AND DEVELOPED WITH FRIGHTFUL RAPIDITY HER VICES SPRANG UP FAST
AND RANK THEY WERE SO STRONG ONLY CRUELTY COULD CHECK THEM AND I WOULD
NOT USE CRUELTY
WHAT A PIGMY INTELLECT SHE HAD AND WHAT GIANT
PROPENSITIES HOW FEARFUL WERE THE CURSES THOSE PROPENSITIES ENTAILED ON
ME BERTHA MASON THE TRUE DAUGHTER OF AN INFAMOUS MOTHER DRAGGED ME
THROUGH ALL THE HIDEOUS AND DEGRADING AGONIES WHICH MUST ATTEND A MAN
BOUND TO A WIFE AT ONCE INTEMPERATE AND UNCHASTE
MY BROTHER IN THE INTERVAL WAS DEAD AND AT THE END OF THE FOUR YEARS MY
FATHER DIED TOO
I WAS RICH ENOUGH NOW YET POOR TO HIDEOUS INDIGENCE A
NATURE THE MOST GROSS IMPURE DEPRAVED I EVER SAW WAS ASSOCIATED WITH
MINE AND CALLED BY THE LAW AND BY SOCIETY A PART OF ME
AND I COULD NOT
RID MYSELF OF IT BY ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS FOR THE DOCTORS NOW DISCOVERED
THAT MY WIFE WAS MAD HER EXCESSES HAD PREMATURELY DEVELOPED THE GERMS
OF INSANITY
JANE YOU DON'T LIKE MY NARRATIVE YOU LOOK ALMOST
SICK SHALL I DEFER THE REST TO ANOTHER DAY
NO SIR FINISH IT NOW I PITY YOU I DO EARNESTLY PITY YOU
PITY JANE FROM SOME PEOPLE IS A NOXIOUS AND INSULTING SORT OF TRIBUTE
WHICH ONE IS JUSTIFIED IN HURLING BACK IN THE TEETH OF THOSE WHO OFFER
IT BUT THAT IS THE SORT OF PITY NATIVE TO CALLOUS SELFISH HEARTS IT IS
A HYBRID EGOTISTICAL PAIN AT HEARING OF WOES CROSSED WITH IGNORANT
CONTEMPT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ENDURED THEM
BUT THAT IS NOT YOUR PITY
JANE IT IS NOT THE FEELING OF WHICH YOUR WHOLE FACE IS FULL AT THIS
MOMENT WITH WHICH YOUR EYES ARE NOW ALMOST OVERFLOWING WITH WHICH YOUR
HEART IS HEAVING WITH WHICH YOUR HAND IS TREMBLING IN MINE
YOUR PITY
MY DARLING IS THE SUFFERING MOTHER OF LOVE ITS ANGUISH IS THE VERY
NATAL PANG OF THE DIVINE PASSION
I ACCEPT IT JANE LET THE DAUGHTER
HAVE FREE ADVENT MY ARMS WAIT TO RECEIVE HER
NOW SIR PROCEED WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU FOUND SHE WAS MAD
JANE I APPROACHED THE VERGE OF DESPAIR A REMNANT OF SELF RESPECT WAS
ALL THAT INTERVENED BETWEEN ME AND THE GULF
IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD I
WAS DOUBTLESS COVERED WITH GRIMY DISHONOUR BUT I RESOLVED TO BE CLEAN IN
MY OWN SIGHT AND TO THE LAST I REPUDIATED THE CONTAMINATION OF HER
CRIMES AND WRENCHED MYSELF FROM CONNECTION WITH HER MENTAL DEFECTS
STILL SOCIETY ASSOCIATED MY NAME AND PERSON WITH HERS I YET SAW HER AND
HEARD HER DAILY SOMETHING OF HER BREATH FAUGH MIXED WITH THE AIR I
BREATHED AND BESIDES I REMEMBERED I HAD ONCE BEEN HER HUSBAND THAT
RECOLLECTION WAS THEN AND IS NOW INEXPRESSIBLY ODIOUS TO ME MOREOVER
I KNEW THAT WHILE SHE LIVED I COULD NEVER BE THE HUSBAND OF ANOTHER AND
BETTER WIFE AND THOUGH FIVE YEARS MY SENIOR HER FAMILY AND HER FATHER
HAD LIED TO ME EVEN IN THE PARTICULAR OF HER AGE SHE WAS LIKELY TO LIVE
AS LONG AS I BEING AS ROBUST IN FRAME AS SHE WAS INFIRM IN MIND
THUS
AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX I WAS HOPELESS
ONE NIGHT I HAD BEEN AWAKENED BY HER YELLS SINCE THE MEDICAL MEN HAD
PRONOUNCED HER MAD SHE HAD OF COURSE BEEN SHUT UP IT WAS A FIERY
WEST INDIAN NIGHT ONE OF THE DESCRIPTION THAT FREQUENTLY PRECEDE THE
HURRICANES OF THOSE CLIMATES
BEING UNABLE TO SLEEP IN BED I GOT UP AND
OPENED THE WINDOW
THE AIR WAS LIKE SULPHUR STEAMS I COULD FIND NO
REFRESHMENT ANYWHERE
MOSQUITOES CAME BUZZING IN AND HUMMED SULLENLY
ROUND THE ROOM THE SEA WHICH I COULD HEAR FROM THENCE RUMBLED DULL
LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE BLACK CLOUDS WERE CASTING UP OVER IT THE MOON WAS
SETTING IN THE WAVES BROAD AND RED LIKE A HOT CANNON BALL SHE THREW
HER LAST BLOODY GLANCE OVER A WORLD QUIVERING WITH THE FERMENT OF
TEMPEST
I WAS PHYSICALLY INFLUENCED BY THE ATMOSPHERE AND SCENE AND MY
EARS WERE FILLED WITH THE CURSES THE MANIAC STILL SHRIEKED OUT WHEREIN
SHE MOMENTARILY MINGLED MY NAME WITH SUCH A TONE OF DEMON HATE WITH SUCH
LANGUAGE NO PROFESSED HARLOT EVER HAD A FOULER VOCABULARY THAN SHE
THOUGH TWO ROOMS OFF I HEARD EVERY WORD THE THIN PARTITIONS OF THE WEST
INDIA HOUSE OPPOSING BUT SLIGHT OBSTRUCTION TO HER WOLFISH CRIES
'THIS LIFE SAID I AT LAST 'IS HELL THIS IS THE AIR THOSE ARE THE
SOUNDS OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT I HAVE A RIGHT TO DELIVER MYSELF FROM IT
IF I CAN
THE SUFFERINGS OF THIS MORTAL STATE WILL LEAVE ME WITH THE
HEAVY FLESH THAT NOW CUMBERS MY SOUL
OF THE FANATIC'S BURNING ETERNITY
I HAVE NO FEAR THERE IS NOT A FUTURE STATE WORSE THAN THIS PRESENT
ONE LET ME BREAK AWAY AND GO HOME TO GOD
I SAID THIS WHILST I KNELT DOWN AT AND UNLOCKED A TRUNK WHICH CONTAINED
A BRACE OF LOADED PISTOLS I MEAN TO SHOOT MYSELF
I ONLY ENTERTAINED
THE INTENTION FOR A MOMENT FOR NOT BEING INSANE THE CRISIS OF
EXQUISITE AND UNALLOYED DESPAIR WHICH HAD ORIGINATED THE WISH AND DESIGN
OF SELF DESTRUCTION WAS PAST IN A SECOND
A WIND FRESH FROM EUROPE BLEW OVER THE OCEAN AND RUSHED THROUGH THE OPEN
CASEMENT THE STORM BROKE STREAMED THUNDERED BLAZED AND THE AIR GREW
PURE
I THEN FRAMED AND FIXED A RESOLUTION
WHILE I WALKED UNDER THE
DRIPPING ORANGE TREES OF MY WET GARDEN AND AMONGST ITS DRENCHED
POMEGRANATES AND PINE APPLES AND WHILE THE REFULGENT DAWN OF THE TROPICS
KINDLED ROUND ME I REASONED THUS JANE AND NOW LISTEN FOR IT WAS TRUE
WISDOM THAT CONSOLED ME IN THAT HOUR AND SHOWED ME THE RIGHT PATH TO
FOLLOW
THE SWEET WIND FROM EUROPE WAS STILL WHISPERING IN THE REFRESHED LEAVES
AND THE ATLANTIC WAS THUNDERING IN GLORIOUS LIBERTY MY HEART DRIED UP
AND SCORCHED FOR A LONG TIME SWELLED TO THE TONE AND FILLED WITH LIVING
BLOOD MY BEING LONGED FOR RENEWAL MY SOUL THIRSTED FOR A PURE DRAUGHT
I SAW HOPE REVIVE AND FELT REGENERATION POSSIBLE
FROM A FLOWERY ARCH
AT THE BOTTOM OF MY GARDEN I GAZED OVER THE SEA BLUER THAN THE SKY THE
OLD WORLD WAS BEYOND CLEAR PROSPECTS OPENED THUS
'GO SAID HOPE 'AND LIVE AGAIN IN EUROPE THERE IT IS NOT KNOWN WHAT A
SULLIED NAME YOU BEAR NOR WHAT A FILTHY BURDEN IS BOUND TO YOU
YOU MAY
TAKE THE MANIAC WITH YOU TO ENGLAND CONFINE HER WITH DUE ATTENDANCE AND
PRECAUTIONS AT THORNFIELD THEN TRAVEL YOURSELF TO WHAT CLIME YOU WILL
AND FORM WHAT NEW TIE YOU LIKE
THAT WOMAN WHO HAS SO ABUSED YOUR LONG
SUFFERING SO SULLIED YOUR NAME SO OUTRAGED YOUR HONOUR SO BLIGHTED
YOUR YOUTH IS NOT YOUR WIFE NOR ARE YOU HER HUSBAND
SEE THAT SHE IS
CARED FOR AS HER CONDITION DEMANDS AND YOU HAVE DONE ALL THAT GOD AND
HUMANITY REQUIRE OF YOU
LET HER IDENTITY HER CONNECTION WITH YOURSELF
BE BURIED IN OBLIVION YOU ARE BOUND TO IMPART THEM TO NO LIVING BEING
PLACE HER IN SAFETY AND COMFORT SHELTER HER DEGRADATION WITH SECRECY
AND LEAVE HER
I ACTED PRECISELY ON THIS SUGGESTION
MY FATHER AND BROTHER HAD NOT
MADE MY MARRIAGE KNOWN TO THEIR ACQUAINTANCE BECAUSE IN THE VERY FIRST
LETTER I WROTE TO APPRISE THEM OF THE UNION HAVING ALREADY BEGUN TO
EXPERIENCE EXTREME DISGUST OF ITS CONSEQUENCES AND FROM THE FAMILY
CHARACTER AND CONSTITUTION SEEING A HIDEOUS FUTURE OPENING TO ME I
ADDED AN URGENT CHARGE TO KEEP IT SECRET AND VERY SOON THE INFAMOUS
CONDUCT OF THE WIFE MY FATHER HAD SELECTED FOR ME WAS SUCH AS TO MAKE HIM
BLUSH TO OWN HER AS HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW
FAR FROM DESIRING TO PUBLISH
THE CONNECTION HE BECAME AS ANXIOUS TO CONCEAL IT AS MYSELF
TO ENGLAND THEN I CONVEYED HER A FEARFUL VOYAGE I HAD WITH SUCH A
MONSTER IN THE VESSEL
GLAD WAS I WHEN I AT LAST GOT HER TO THORNFIELD
AND SAW HER SAFELY LODGED IN THAT THIRD STOREY ROOM OF WHOSE SECRET
INNER CABINET SHE HAS NOW FOR TEN YEARS MADE A WILD BEAST'S DEN A
GOBLIN'S CELL
I HAD SOME TROUBLE IN FINDING AN ATTENDANT FOR HER AS IT
WAS NECESSARY TO SELECT ONE ON WHOSE FIDELITY DEPENDENCE COULD BE PLACED
FOR HER RAVINGS WOULD INEVITABLY BETRAY MY SECRET BESIDES SHE HAD LUCID
INTERVALS OF DAYS SOMETIMES WEEKS WHICH SHE FILLED UP WITH ABUSE OF ME
AT LAST I HIRED GRACE POOLE FROM THE GRIMBSY RETREAT
SHE AND THE
SURGEON CARTER WHO DRESSED MASON'S WOUNDS THAT NIGHT HE WAS STABBED AND
WORRIED ARE THE ONLY TWO I HAVE EVER ADMITTED TO MY CONFIDENCE
MRS
FAIRFAX MAY INDEED HAVE SUSPECTED SOMETHING BUT SHE COULD HAVE GAINED NO
PRECISE KNOWLEDGE AS TO FACTS
GRACE HAS ON THE WHOLE PROVED A GOOD
KEEPER THOUGH OWING PARTLY TO A FAULT OF HER OWN OF WHICH IT APPEARS
NOTHING CAN CURE HER AND WHICH IS INCIDENT TO HER HARASSING PROFESSION
HER VIGILANCE HAS BEEN MORE THAN ONCE LULLED AND BAFFLED
THE LUNATIC IS
BOTH CUNNING AND MALIGNANT SHE HAS NEVER FAILED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER
GUARDIAN'S TEMPORARY LAPSES ONCE TO SECRETE THE KNIFE WITH WHICH SHE
STABBED HER BROTHER AND TWICE TO POSSESS HERSELF OF THE KEY OF HER CELL
AND ISSUE THEREFROM IN THE NIGHT TIME
ON THE FIRST OF THESE OCCASIONS
SHE PERPETRATED THE ATTEMPT TO BURN ME IN MY BED ON THE SECOND SHE PAID
THAT GHASTLY VISIT TO YOU
I THANK PROVIDENCE WHO WATCHED OVER YOU
THAT SHE THEN SPENT HER FURY ON YOUR WEDDING APPAREL WHICH PERHAPS
BROUGHT BACK VAGUE REMINISCENCES OF HER OWN BRIDAL DAYS BUT ON WHAT
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED I CANNOT ENDURE TO REFLECT
WHEN I THINK OF THE
THING WHICH FLEW AT MY THROAT THIS MORNING HANGING ITS BLACK AND SCARLET
VISAGE OVER THE NEST OF MY DOVE MY BLOOD CURDLES
AND WHAT SIR I ASKED WHILE HE PAUSED DID YOU DO WHEN YOU HAD
SETTLED HER HERE WHERE DID YOU GO
WHAT DID I DO JANE I TRANSFORMED MYSELF INTO A WILL O' THE WISP
WHERE DID I GO I PURSUED WANDERINGS AS WILD AS THOSE OF THE
MARCH SPIRIT
I SOUGHT THE CONTINENT AND WENT DEVIOUS THROUGH ALL ITS
LANDS
MY FIXED DESIRE WAS TO SEEK AND FIND A GOOD AND INTELLIGENT
WOMAN WHOM I COULD LOVE A CONTRAST TO THE FURY I LEFT AT THORNFIELD
BUT YOU COULD NOT MARRY SIR
I HAD DETERMINED AND WAS CONVINCED THAT I COULD AND OUGHT
IT WAS NOT
MY ORIGINAL INTENTION TO DECEIVE AS I HAVE DECEIVED YOU
I MEANT TO
TELL MY TALE PLAINLY AND MAKE MY PROPOSALS OPENLY AND IT APPEARED TO ME
SO ABSOLUTELY RATIONAL THAT I SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FREE TO LOVE AND BE
LOVED I NEVER DOUBTED SOME WOMAN MIGHT BE FOUND WILLING AND ABLE TO
UNDERSTAND MY CASE AND ACCEPT ME IN SPITE OF THE CURSE WITH WHICH I WAS
BURDENED
WELL SIR
WHEN YOU ARE INQUISITIVE JANE YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME SMILE
YOU OPEN YOUR
EYES LIKE AN EAGER BIRD AND MAKE EVERY NOW AND THEN A RESTLESS MOVEMENT
AS IF ANSWERS IN SPEECH DID NOT FLOW FAST ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU WANTED
TO READ THE TABLET OF ONE'S HEART
BUT BEFORE I GO ON TELL ME WHAT YOU
MEAN BY YOUR 'WELL SIR IT IS A SMALL PHRASE VERY FREQUENT WITH YOU
AND WHICH MANY A TIME HAS DRAWN ME ON AND ON THROUGH INTERMINABLE TALK I
DON'T VERY WELL KNOW WHY
I MEAN WHAT NEXT HOW DID YOU PROCEED WHAT CAME OF SUCH AN EVENT
PRECISELY AND WHAT DO YOU WISH TO KNOW NOW
WHETHER YOU FOUND ANY ONE YOU LIKED WHETHER YOU ASKED HER TO MARRY YOU
AND WHAT SHE SAID
I CAN TELL YOU WHETHER I FOUND ANY ONE I LIKED AND WHETHER I ASKED HER
TO MARRY ME BUT WHAT SHE SAID IS YET TO BE RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF FATE
FOR TEN LONG YEARS I ROVED ABOUT LIVING FIRST IN ONE CAPITAL THEN
ANOTHER SOMETIMES IN ST
PETERSBURG OFTENER IN PARIS OCCASIONALLY IN
ROME NAPLES AND FLORENCE
PROVIDED WITH PLENTY OF MONEY AND THE
PASSPORT OF AN OLD NAME I COULD CHOOSE MY OWN SOCIETY NO CIRCLES WERE
CLOSED AGAINST ME
I SOUGHT MY IDEAL OF A WOMAN AMONGST ENGLISH LADIES
FRENCH COUNTESSES ITALIAN SIGNORAS AND GERMAN GRAFINNEN
I COULD NOT
FIND HER
SOMETIMES FOR A FLEETING MOMENT I THOUGHT I CAUGHT A GLANCE
HEARD A TONE BEHELD A FORM WHICH ANNOUNCED THE REALISATION OF MY DREAM
BUT I WAS PRESENTLY UNDESERVED
YOU ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THAT I DESIRED
PERFECTION EITHER OF MIND OR PERSON
I LONGED ONLY FOR WHAT SUITED
ME FOR THE ANTIPODES OF THE CREOLE AND I LONGED VAINLY
AMONGST THEM
ALL I FOUND NOT ONE WHOM HAD I BEEN EVER SO FREE I WARNED AS I WAS OF
THE RISKS THE HORRORS THE LOATHINGS OF INCONGRUOUS UNIONS WOULD HAVE
ASKED TO MARRY ME
DISAPPOINTMENT MADE ME RECKLESS
I TRIED
DISSIPATION NEVER DEBAUCHERY THAT I HATED AND HATE
THAT WAS MY
INDIAN MESSALINA'S ATTRIBUTE ROOTED DISGUST AT IT AND HER RESTRAINED ME
MUCH EVEN IN PLEASURE
ANY ENJOYMENT THAT BORDERED ON RIOT SEEMED TO
APPROACH ME TO HER AND HER VICES AND I ESCHEWED IT
YET I COULD NOT LIVE ALONE SO I TRIED THE COMPANIONSHIP OF MISTRESSES
THE FIRST I CHOSE WAS CELINE VARENS ANOTHER OF THOSE STEPS WHICH MAKE A
MAN SPURN HIMSELF WHEN HE RECALLS THEM
YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT SHE WAS
AND HOW MY LIAISON WITH HER TERMINATED
SHE HAD TWO SUCCESSORS AN
ITALIAN GIACINTA AND A GERMAN CLARA BOTH CONSIDERED SINGULARLY
HANDSOME
WHAT WAS THEIR BEAUTY TO ME IN A FEW WEEKS GIACINTA WAS
UNPRINCIPLED AND VIOLENT I TIRED OF HER IN THREE MONTHS
CLARA WAS
HONEST AND QUIET BUT HEAVY MINDLESS AND UNIMPRESSIBLE NOT ONE WHIT TO
MY TASTE
I WAS GLAD TO GIVE HER A SUFFICIENT SUM TO SET HER UP IN A
GOOD LINE OF BUSINESS AND SO GET DECENTLY RID OF HER
BUT JANE I SEE
BY YOUR FACE YOU ARE NOT FORMING A VERY FAVOURABLE OPINION OF ME JUST
NOW
YOU THINK ME AN UNFEELING LOOSE PRINCIPLED RAKE DON'T YOU
I DON'T LIKE YOU SO WELL AS I HAVE DONE SOMETIMES INDEED SIR
DID IT
NOT SEEM TO YOU IN THE LEAST WRONG TO LIVE IN THAT WAY FIRST WITH ONE
MISTRESS AND THEN ANOTHER YOU TALK OF IT AS A MERE MATTER OF COURSE
IT WAS WITH ME AND I DID NOT LIKE IT
IT WAS A GROVELLING FASHION OF
EXISTENCE I SHOULD NEVER LIKE TO RETURN TO IT
HIRING A MISTRESS IS THE
NEXT WORSE THING TO BUYING A SLAVE BOTH ARE OFTEN BY NATURE AND ALWAYS
BY POSITION INFERIOR AND TO LIVE FAMILIARLY WITH INFERIORS IS
DEGRADING
I NOW HATE THE RECOLLECTION OF THE TIME I PASSED WITH CELINE
GIACINTA AND CLARA
I FELT THE TRUTH OF THESE WORDS AND I DREW FROM THEM THE CERTAIN
INFERENCE THAT IF I WERE SO FAR TO FORGET MYSELF AND ALL THE TEACHING
THAT HAD EVER BEEN INSTILLED INTO ME AS UNDER ANY PRETEXT WITH ANY
JUSTIFICATION THROUGH ANY TEMPTATION TO BECOME THE SUCCESSOR OF THESE
POOR GIRLS HE WOULD ONE DAY REGARD ME WITH THE SAME FEELING WHICH NOW IN
HIS MIND DESECRATED THEIR MEMORY
I DID NOT GIVE UTTERANCE TO THIS
CONVICTION IT WAS ENOUGH TO FEEL IT
I IMPRESSED IT ON MY HEART THAT
IT MIGHT REMAIN THERE TO SERVE ME AS AID IN THE TIME OF TRIAL
NOW JANE WHY DON'T YOU SAY 'WELL SIR I HAVE NOT DONE
YOU ARE
LOOKING GRAVE
YOU DISAPPROVE OF ME STILL I SEE
BUT LET ME COME TO
THE POINT
LAST JANUARY RID OF ALL MISTRESSES IN A HARSH BITTER FRAME
OF MIND THE RESULT OF A USELESS ROVING LONELY LIFE CORRODED WITH
DISAPPOINTMENT SOURLY DISPOSED AGAINST ALL MEN AND ESPECIALLY AGAINST
ALL WOMANKIND FOR I BEGAN TO REGARD THE NOTION OF AN INTELLECTUAL
FAITHFUL LOVING WOMAN AS A MERE DREAM RECALLED BY BUSINESS I CAME
BACK TO ENGLAND
ON A FROSTY WINTER AFTERNOON I RODE IN SIGHT OF THORNFIELD HALL
ABHORRED SPOT I EXPECTED NO PEACE NO PLEASURE THERE
ON A STILE IN
HAY LANE I SAW A QUIET LITTLE FIGURE SITTING BY ITSELF
I PASSED IT AS
NEGLIGENTLY AS I DID THE POLLARD WILLOW OPPOSITE TO IT I HAD NO
PRESENTIMENT OF WHAT IT WOULD BE TO ME NO INWARD WARNING THAT THE
ARBITRESS OF MY LIFE MY GENIUS FOR GOOD OR EVIL WAITED THERE IN HUMBLE
GUISE
I DID NOT KNOW IT EVEN WHEN ON THE OCCASION OF MESROUR'S
ACCIDENT IT CAME UP AND GRAVELY OFFERED ME HELP
CHILDISH AND SLENDER
CREATURE IT SEEMED AS IF A LINNET HAD HOPPED TO MY FOOT AND PROPOSED TO
BEAR ME ON ITS TINY WING
I WAS SURLY BUT THE THING WOULD NOT GO IT
STOOD BY ME WITH STRANGE PERSEVERANCE AND LOOKED AND SPOKE WITH A SORT
OF AUTHORITY
I MUST BE AIDED AND BY THAT HAND AND AIDED I WAS
WHEN ONCE I HAD PRESSED THE FRAIL SHOULDER SOMETHING NEW A FRESH SAP
AND SENSE STOLE INTO MY FRAME
IT WAS WELL I HAD LEARNT THAT THIS ELF
MUST RETURN TO ME THAT IT BELONGED TO MY HOUSE DOWN BELOW OR I COULD
NOT HAVE FELT IT PASS AWAY FROM UNDER MY HAND AND SEEN IT VANISH BEHIND
THE DIM HEDGE WITHOUT SINGULAR REGRET
I HEARD YOU COME HOME THAT
NIGHT JANE THOUGH PROBABLY YOU WERE NOT AWARE THAT I THOUGHT OF YOU OR
WATCHED FOR YOU
THE NEXT DAY I OBSERVED YOU MYSELF UNSEEN FOR HALF AN
HOUR WHILE YOU PLAYED WITH ADELE IN THE GALLERY
IT WAS A SNOWY DAY I
RECOLLECT AND YOU COULD NOT GO OUT OF DOORS
I WAS IN MY ROOM THE DOOR
WAS AJAR I COULD BOTH LISTEN AND WATCH
ADELE CLAIMED YOUR OUTWARD
ATTENTION FOR A WHILE YET I FANCIED YOUR THOUGHTS WERE ELSEWHERE BUT
YOU WERE VERY PATIENT WITH HER MY LITTLE JANE YOU TALKED TO HER AND
AMUSED HER A LONG TIME
WHEN AT LAST SHE LEFT YOU YOU LAPSED AT ONCE
INTO DEEP REVERIE YOU BETOOK YOURSELF SLOWLY TO PACE THE GALLERY
NOW
AND THEN IN PASSING A CASEMENT YOU GLANCED OUT AT THE THICK FALLING
SNOW YOU LISTENED TO THE SOBBING WIND AND AGAIN YOU PACED GENTLY ON AND
DREAMED
I THINK THOSE DAY VISIONS WERE NOT DARK THERE WAS A
PLEASURABLE ILLUMINATION IN YOUR EYE OCCASIONALLY A SOFT EXCITEMENT IN
YOUR ASPECT WHICH TOLD OF NO BITTER BILIOUS HYPOCHONDRIAC BROODING
YOUR LOOK REVEALED RATHER THE SWEET MUSINGS OF YOUTH WHEN ITS SPIRIT
FOLLOWS ON WILLING WINGS THE FLIGHT OF HOPE UP AND ON TO AN IDEAL HEAVEN
THE VOICE OF MRS
FAIRFAX SPEAKING TO A SERVANT IN THE HALL WAKENED
YOU AND HOW CURIOUSLY YOU SMILED TO AND AT YOURSELF JANET THERE WAS
MUCH SENSE IN YOUR SMILE IT WAS VERY SHREWD AND SEEMED TO MAKE LIGHT OF
YOUR OWN ABSTRACTION
IT SEEMED TO SAY 'MY FINE VISIONS ARE ALL VERY
WELL BUT I MUST NOT FORGET THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY UNREAL
I HAVE A ROSY
SKY AND A GREEN FLOWERY EDEN IN MY BRAIN BUT WITHOUT I AM PERFECTLY
AWARE LIES AT MY FEET A ROUGH TRACT TO TRAVEL AND AROUND ME GATHER
BLACK TEMPESTS TO ENCOUNTER YOU RAN DOWNSTAIRS AND DEMANDED OF MRS
FAIRFAX SOME OCCUPATION THE WEEKLY HOUSE ACCOUNTS TO MAKE UP OR
SOMETHING OF THAT SORT I THINK IT WAS
I WAS VEXED WITH YOU FOR GETTING
OUT OF MY SIGHT
IMPATIENTLY I WAITED FOR EVENING WHEN I MIGHT SUMMON YOU TO MY
PRESENCE
AN UNUSUAL TO ME A PERFECTLY NEW CHARACTER I SUSPECTED WAS
YOURS I DESIRED TO SEARCH IT DEEPER AND KNOW IT BETTER
YOU ENTERED THE
ROOM WITH A LOOK AND AIR AT ONCE SHY AND INDEPENDENT YOU WERE QUAINTLY
DRESSED MUCH AS YOU ARE NOW
I MADE YOU TALK ERE LONG I FOUND YOU FULL
OF STRANGE CONTRASTS
YOUR GARB AND MANNER WERE RESTRICTED BY RULE YOUR
AIR WAS OFTEN DIFFIDENT AND ALTOGETHER THAT OF ONE REFINED BY NATURE
BUT ABSOLUTELY UNUSED TO SOCIETY AND A GOOD DEAL AFRAID OF MAKING
HERSELF DISADVANTAGEOUSLY CONSPICUOUS BY SOME SOLECISM OR BLUNDER YET
WHEN ADDRESSED YOU LIFTED A KEEN A DARING AND A GLOWING EYE TO YOUR
INTERLOCUTOR'S FACE THERE WAS PENETRATION AND POWER IN EACH GLANCE YOU
GAVE WHEN PLIED BY CLOSE QUESTIONS YOU FOUND READY AND ROUND ANSWERS
VERY SOON YOU SEEMED TO GET USED TO ME I BELIEVE YOU FELT THE EXISTENCE
OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR GRIM AND CROSS MASTER JANE FOR IT WAS
ASTONISHING TO SEE HOW QUICKLY A CERTAIN PLEASANT EASE TRANQUILLISED YOUR
MANNER SNARL AS I WOULD YOU SHOWED NO SURPRISE FEAR ANNOYANCE OR
DISPLEASURE AT MY MOROSENESS YOU WATCHED ME AND NOW AND THEN SMILED AT
ME WITH A SIMPLE YET SAGACIOUS GRACE I CANNOT DESCRIBE
I WAS AT ONCE
CONTENT AND STIMULATED WITH WHAT I SAW I LIKED WHAT I HAD SEEN AND
WISHED TO SEE MORE
YET FOR A LONG TIME I TREATED YOU DISTANTLY AND
SOUGHT YOUR COMPANY RARELY
I WAS AN INTELLECTUAL EPICURE AND WISHED TO
PROLONG THE GRATIFICATION OF MAKING THIS NOVEL AND PIQUANT ACQUAINTANCE
BESIDES I WAS FOR A WHILE TROUBLED WITH A HAUNTING FEAR THAT IF I
HANDLED THE FLOWER FREELY ITS BLOOM WOULD FADE THE SWEET CHARM OF
FRESHNESS WOULD LEAVE IT
I DID NOT THEN KNOW THAT IT WAS NO TRANSITORY
BLOSSOM BUT RATHER THE RADIANT RESEMBLANCE OF ONE CUT IN AN
INDESTRUCTIBLE GEM
MOREOVER I WISHED TO SEE WHETHER YOU WOULD SEEK ME
IF I SHUNNED YOU BUT YOU DID NOT YOU KEPT IN THE SCHOOLROOM AS STILL AS
YOUR OWN DESK AND EASEL IF BY CHANCE I MET YOU YOU PASSED ME AS SOON
AND WITH AS LITTLE TOKEN OF RECOGNITION AS WAS CONSISTENT WITH RESPECT
YOUR HABITUAL EXPRESSION IN THOSE DAYS JANE WAS A THOUGHTFUL LOOK NOT
DESPONDENT FOR YOU WERE NOT SICKLY BUT NOT BUOYANT FOR YOU HAD LITTLE
HOPE AND NO ACTUAL PLEASURE
I WONDERED WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF ME OR IF
YOU EVER THOUGHT OF ME AND RESOLVED TO FIND THIS OUT
I RESUMED MY NOTICE OF YOU
THERE WAS SOMETHING GLAD IN YOUR GLANCE
AND GENIAL IN YOUR MANNER WHEN YOU CONVERSED I SAW YOU HAD A SOCIAL
HEART IT WAS THE SILENT SCHOOLROOM IT WAS THE TEDIUM OF YOUR LIFE THAT
MADE YOU MOURNFUL
I PERMITTED MYSELF THE DELIGHT OF BEING KIND TO YOU
KINDNESS STIRRED EMOTION SOON YOUR FACE BECAME SOFT IN EXPRESSION YOUR
TONES GENTLE I LIKED MY NAME PRONOUNCED BY YOUR LIPS IN A GRATEFUL HAPPY
ACCENT
I USED TO ENJOY A CHANCE MEETING WITH YOU JANE AT THIS TIME
THERE WAS A CURIOUS HESITATION IN YOUR MANNER YOU GLANCED AT ME WITH A
SLIGHT TROUBLE A HOVERING DOUBT YOU DID NOT KNOW WHAT MY CAPRICE MIGHT
BE WHETHER I WAS GOING TO PLAY THE MASTER AND BE STERN OR THE FRIEND
AND BE BENIGNANT
I WAS NOW TOO FOND OF YOU OFTEN TO SIMULATE THE FIRST
WHIM AND WHEN I STRETCHED MY HAND OUT CORDIALLY SUCH BLOOM AND LIGHT
AND BLISS ROSE TO YOUR YOUNG WISTFUL FEATURES I HAD MUCH ADO OFTEN TO
AVOID STRAINING YOU THEN AND THERE TO MY HEART
DON'T TALK ANY MORE OF THOSE DAYS SIR I INTERRUPTED FURTIVELY
DASHING AWAY SOME TEARS FROM MY EYES HIS LANGUAGE WAS TORTURE TO ME FOR
I KNEW WHAT I MUST DO AND DO SOON AND ALL THESE REMINISCENCES AND
THESE REVELATIONS OF HIS FEELINGS ONLY MADE MY WORK MORE DIFFICULT
NO JANE HE RETURNED WHAT NECESSITY IS THERE TO DWELL ON THE PAST
WHEN THE PRESENT IS SO MUCH SURER THE FUTURE SO MUCH BRIGHTER
I SHUDDERED TO HEAR THE INFATUATED ASSERTION
YOU SEE NOW HOW THE CASE STANDS DO YOU NOT HE CONTINUED
AFTER A
YOUTH AND MANHOOD PASSED HALF IN UNUTTERABLE MISERY AND HALF IN DREARY
SOLITUDE I HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME FOUND WHAT I CAN TRULY LOVE I HAVE
FOUND YOU
YOU ARE MY SYMPATHY MY BETTER SELF MY GOOD ANGEL
I AM
BOUND TO YOU WITH A STRONG ATTACHMENT
I THINK YOU GOOD GIFTED LOVELY
A FERVENT A SOLEMN PASSION IS CONCEIVED IN MY HEART IT LEANS TO YOU
DRAWS YOU TO MY CENTRE AND SPRING OF LIFE WRAPS MY EXISTENCE ABOUT YOU
AND KINDLING IN PURE POWERFUL FLAME FUSES YOU AND ME IN ONE
IT WAS BECAUSE I FELT AND KNEW THIS THAT I RESOLVED TO MARRY YOU
TO
TELL ME THAT I HAD ALREADY A WIFE IS EMPTY MOCKERY YOU KNOW NOW THAT I
HAD BUT A HIDEOUS DEMON
I WAS WRONG TO ATTEMPT TO DECEIVE YOU BUT I
FEARED A STUBBORNNESS THAT EXISTS IN YOUR CHARACTER
I FEARED EARLY
INSTILLED PREJUDICE I WANTED TO HAVE YOU SAFE BEFORE HAZARDING
CONFIDENCES
THIS WAS COWARDLY I SHOULD HAVE APPEALED TO YOUR NOBLENESS
AND MAGNANIMITY AT FIRST AS I DO NOW OPENED TO YOU PLAINLY MY LIFE OF
AGONY DESCRIBED TO YOU MY HUNGER AND THIRST AFTER A HIGHER AND WORTHIER
EXISTENCE SHOWN TO YOU NOT MY RESOLUTION THAT WORD IS WEAK BUT MY
RESISTLESS BENT TO LOVE FAITHFULLY AND WELL WHERE I AM FAITHFULLY AND
WELL LOVED IN RETURN
THEN I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU TO ACCEPT MY PLEDGE
OF FIDELITY AND TO GIVE ME YOURS
JANE GIVE IT ME NOW
A PAUSE
WHY ARE YOU SILENT JANE
I WAS EXPERIENCING AN ORDEAL A HAND OF FIERY IRON GRASPED MY VITALS
TERRIBLE MOMENT FULL OF STRUGGLE BLACKNESS BURNING NOT A HUMAN BEING
THAT EVER LIVED COULD WISH TO BE LOVED BETTER THAN I WAS LOVED AND HIM
WHO THUS LOVED ME I ABSOLUTELY WORSHIPPED AND I MUST RENOUNCE LOVE AND
IDOL
ONE DREAR WORD COMPRISED MY INTOLERABLE DUTY DEPART
JANE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I WANT OF YOU JUST THIS PROMISE 'I WILL BE
YOURS MR
ROCHESTER

ROCHESTER I WILL NOT BE YOURS
ANOTHER LONG SILENCE
JANE RECOMMENCED HE WITH A GENTLENESS THAT BROKE ME DOWN WITH GRIEF
AND TURNED ME STONE COLD WITH OMINOUS TERROR FOR THIS STILL VOICE WAS
THE PANT OF A LION RISING JANE DO YOU MEAN TO GO ONE WAY IN THE WORLD
AND TO LET ME GO ANOTHER
I DO
JANE BENDING TOWARDS AND EMBRACING ME DO YOU MEAN IT NOW
I DO
AND NOW SOFTLY KISSING MY FOREHEAD AND CHEEK
I DO EXTRICATING MYSELF FROM RESTRAINT RAPIDLY AND COMPLETELY
OH JANE THIS IS BITTER THIS THIS IS WICKED
IT WOULD NOT BE WICKED
TO LOVE ME
IT WOULD TO OBEY YOU
A WILD LOOK RAISED HIS BROWS CROSSED HIS FEATURES HE ROSE BUT HE
FOREBORE YET
I LAID MY HAND ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR FOR SUPPORT I
SHOOK I FEARED BUT I RESOLVED
ONE INSTANT JANE
GIVE ONE GLANCE TO MY HORRIBLE LIFE WHEN YOU ARE
GONE
ALL HAPPINESS WILL BE TORN AWAY WITH YOU
WHAT THEN IS LEFT FOR
A WIFE I HAVE BUT THE MANIAC UPSTAIRS AS WELL MIGHT YOU REFER ME TO SOME
CORPSE IN YONDER CHURCHYARD
WHAT SHALL I DO JANE WHERE TURN FOR A
COMPANION AND FOR SOME HOPE
DO AS I DO TRUST IN GOD AND YOURSELF
BELIEVE IN HEAVEN
HOPE TO MEET
AGAIN THERE
THEN YOU WILL NOT YIELD
NO
THEN YOU CONDEMN ME TO LIVE WRETCHED AND TO DIE ACCURSED HIS VOICE
ROSE
I ADVISE YOU TO LIVE SINLESS AND I WISH YOU TO DIE TRANQUIL
THEN YOU SNATCH LOVE AND INNOCENCE FROM ME YOU FLING ME BACK ON LUST
FOR A PASSION VICE FOR AN OCCUPATION
MR
ROCHESTER I NO MORE ASSIGN THIS FATE TO YOU THAN I GRASP AT IT FOR
MYSELF
WE WERE BORN TO STRIVE AND ENDURE YOU AS WELL AS I DO SO
YOU
WILL FORGET ME BEFORE I FORGET YOU
YOU MAKE ME A LIAR BY SUCH LANGUAGE YOU SULLY MY HONOUR
I DECLARED I
COULD NOT CHANGE YOU TELL ME TO MY FACE I SHALL CHANGE SOON
AND WHAT A
DISTORTION IN YOUR JUDGMENT WHAT A PERVERSITY IN YOUR IDEAS IS PROVED
BY YOUR CONDUCT IS IT BETTER TO DRIVE A FELLOW CREATURE TO DESPAIR THAN
TO TRANSGRESS A MERE HUMAN LAW NO MAN BEING INJURED BY THE BREACH FOR
YOU HAVE NEITHER RELATIVES NOR ACQUAINTANCES WHOM YOU NEED FEAR TO OFFEND
BY LIVING WITH ME
THIS WAS TRUE AND WHILE HE SPOKE MY VERY CONSCIENCE AND REASON TURNED
TRAITORS AGAINST ME AND CHARGED ME WITH CRIME IN RESISTING HIM
THEY
SPOKE ALMOST AS LOUD AS FEELING AND THAT CLAMOURED WILDLY
OH
COMPLY IT SAID
THINK OF HIS MISERY THINK OF HIS DANGER LOOK AT HIS
STATE WHEN LEFT ALONE REMEMBER HIS HEADLONG NATURE CONSIDER THE
RECKLESSNESS FOLLOWING ON DESPAIR SOOTHE HIM SAVE HIM LOVE HIM TELL
HIM YOU LOVE HIM AND WILL BE HIS
WHO IN THE WORLD CARES FOR YOU OR
WHO WILL BE INJURED BY WHAT YOU DO
STILL INDOMITABLE WAS THE REPLY I CARE FOR MYSELF
THE MORE
SOLITARY THE MORE FRIENDLESS THE MORE UNSUSTAINED I AM THE MORE I WILL
RESPECT MYSELF
I WILL KEEP THE LAW GIVEN BY GOD SANCTIONED BY MAN
I
WILL HOLD TO THE PRINCIPLES RECEIVED BY ME WHEN I WAS SANE AND NOT
MAD AS I AM NOW
LAWS AND PRINCIPLES ARE NOT FOR THE TIMES WHEN THERE
IS NO TEMPTATION THEY ARE FOR SUCH MOMENTS AS THIS WHEN BODY AND SOUL
RISE IN MUTINY AGAINST THEIR RIGOUR STRINGENT ARE THEY INVIOLATE THEY
SHALL BE
IF AT MY INDIVIDUAL CONVENIENCE I MIGHT BREAK THEM WHAT WOULD
BE THEIR WORTH THEY HAVE A WORTH SO I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED AND IF I
CANNOT BELIEVE IT NOW IT IS BECAUSE I AM INSANE QUITE INSANE WITH MY
VEINS RUNNING FIRE AND MY HEART BEATING FASTER THAN I CAN COUNT ITS
THROBS
PRECONCEIVED OPINIONS FOREGONE DETERMINATIONS ARE ALL I HAVE
AT THIS HOUR TO STAND BY THERE I PLANT MY FOOT
I DID
MR
ROCHESTER READING MY COUNTENANCE SAW I HAD DONE SO
HIS
FURY WAS WROUGHT TO THE HIGHEST HE MUST YIELD TO IT FOR A MOMENT
WHATEVER FOLLOWED HE CROSSED THE FLOOR AND SEIZED MY ARM AND GRASPED MY
WAIST
HE SEEMED TO DEVOUR ME WITH HIS FLAMING GLANCE PHYSICALLY I
FELT AT THE MOMENT POWERLESS AS STUBBLE EXPOSED TO THE DRAUGHT AND GLOW
OF A FURNACE MENTALLY I STILL POSSESSED MY SOUL AND WITH IT THE
CERTAINTY OF ULTIMATE SAFETY
THE SOUL FORTUNATELY HAS AN
INTERPRETER OFTEN AN UNCONSCIOUS BUT STILL A TRUTHFUL INTERPRETER IN
THE EYE
MY EYE ROSE TO HIS AND WHILE I LOOKED IN HIS FIERCE FACE I
GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY SIGH HIS GRIPE WAS PAINFUL AND MY OVER TAXED
STRENGTH ALMOST EXHAUSTED
NEVER SAID HE AS HE GROUND HIS TEETH NEVER WAS ANYTHING AT ONCE SO
FRAIL AND SO INDOMITABLE
A MERE REED SHE FEELS IN MY HAND AND HE
SHOOK ME WITH THE FORCE OF HIS HOLD I COULD BEND HER WITH MY FINGER
AND THUMB AND WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO IF I BENT IF I UPTORE IF I CRUSHED
HER CONSIDER THAT EYE CONSIDER THE RESOLUTE WILD FREE THING LOOKING
OUT OF IT DEFYING ME WITH MORE THAN COURAGE WITH A STERN TRIUMPH
WHATEVER I DO WITH ITS CAGE I CANNOT GET AT IT THE SAVAGE BEAUTIFUL
CREATURE IF I TEAR IF I REND THE SLIGHT PRISON MY OUTRAGE WILL ONLY
LET THE CAPTIVE LOOSE
CONQUEROR I MIGHT BE OF THE HOUSE BUT THE INMATE
WOULD ESCAPE TO HEAVEN BEFORE I COULD CALL MYSELF POSSESSOR OF ITS CLAY
DWELLING PLACE
AND IT IS YOU SPIRIT WITH WILL AND ENERGY AND VIRTUE
AND PURITY THAT I WANT NOT ALONE YOUR BRITTLE FRAME
OF YOURSELF YOU
COULD COME WITH SOFT FLIGHT AND NESTLE AGAINST MY HEART IF YOU WOULD
SEIZED AGAINST YOUR WILL YOU WILL ELUDE THE GRASP LIKE AN ESSENCE YOU
WILL VANISH ERE I INHALE YOUR FRAGRANCE
OH COME JANE COME
AS HE SAID THIS HE RELEASED ME FROM HIS CLUTCH AND ONLY LOOKED AT ME
THE LOOK WAS FAR WORSE TO RESIST THAN THE FRANTIC STRAIN ONLY AN IDIOT
HOWEVER WOULD HAVE SUCCUMBED NOW
I HAD DARED AND BAFFLED HIS FURY I
MUST ELUDE HIS SORROW I RETIRED TO THE DOOR
YOU ARE GOING JANE
I AM GOING SIR
YOU ARE LEAVING ME
YES
YOU WILL NOT COME YOU WILL NOT BE MY COMFORTER MY RESCUER MY DEEP
LOVE MY WILD WOE MY FRANTIC PRAYER ARE ALL NOTHING TO YOU
WHAT UNUTTERABLE PATHOS WAS IN HIS VOICE HOW HARD IT WAS TO REITERATE
FIRMLY I AM GOING
JANE
MR
ROCHESTER
WITHDRAW THEN I CONSENT BUT REMEMBER YOU LEAVE ME HERE IN ANGUISH
GO UP TO YOUR OWN ROOM THINK OVER ALL I HAVE SAID AND JANE CAST A
GLANCE ON MY SUFFERINGS THINK OF ME
HE TURNED AWAY HE THREW HIMSELF ON HIS FACE ON THE SOFA
OH JANE MY
HOPE MY LOVE MY LIFE BROKE IN ANGUISH FROM HIS LIPS
THEN CAME A
DEEP STRONG SOB
I HAD ALREADY GAINED THE DOOR BUT READER I WALKED BACK WALKED BACK AS
DETERMINEDLY AS I HAD RETREATED
I KNELT DOWN BY HIM I TURNED HIS FACE
FROM THE CUSHION TO ME I KISSED HIS CHEEK I SMOOTHED HIS HAIR WITH MY
HAND
GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR MASTER I SAID
GOD KEEP YOU FROM HARM AND
WRONG DIRECT YOU SOLACE YOU REWARD YOU WELL FOR YOUR PAST KINDNESS TO
ME
LITTLE JANE'S LOVE WOULD HAVE BEEN MY BEST REWARD HE ANSWERED
WITHOUT IT MY HEART IS BROKEN
BUT JANE WILL GIVE ME HER LOVE
YES NOBLY GENEROUSLY
UP THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS FACE FORTH FLASHED THE FIRE FROM HIS EYES
ERECT HE SPRANG HE HELD HIS ARMS OUT BUT I EVADED THE EMBRACE AND AT
ONCE QUITTED THE ROOM
FAREWELL WAS THE CRY OF MY HEART AS I LEFT HIM
DESPAIR ADDED
FAREWELL FOR EVER
THAT NIGHT I NEVER THOUGHT TO SLEEP BUT A SLUMBER FELL ON ME AS SOON AS
I LAY DOWN IN BED
I WAS TRANSPORTED IN THOUGHT TO THE SCENES OF
CHILDHOOD I DREAMT I LAY IN THE RED ROOM AT GATESHEAD THAT THE NIGHT
WAS DARK AND MY MIND IMPRESSED WITH STRANGE FEARS
THE LIGHT THAT LONG
AGO HAD STRUCK ME INTO SYNCOPE RECALLED IN THIS VISION SEEMED GLIDINGLY
TO MOUNT THE WALL AND TREMBLINGLY TO PAUSE IN THE CENTRE OF THE OBSCURED
CEILING
I LIFTED UP MY HEAD TO LOOK THE ROOF RESOLVED TO CLOUDS HIGH
AND DIM THE GLEAM WAS SUCH AS THE MOON IMPARTS TO VAPOURS SHE IS ABOUT
TO SEVER
I WATCHED HER COME WATCHED WITH THE STRANGEST ANTICIPATION
AS THOUGH SOME WORD OF DOOM WERE TO BE WRITTEN ON HER DISK
SHE BROKE
FORTH AS NEVER MOON YET BURST FROM CLOUD A HAND FIRST PENETRATED THE
SABLE FOLDS AND WAVED THEM AWAY THEN NOT A MOON BUT A WHITE HUMAN FORM
SHONE IN THE AZURE INCLINING A GLORIOUS BROW EARTHWARD
IT GAZED AND
GAZED ON ME
IT SPOKE TO MY SPIRIT IMMEASURABLY DISTANT WAS THE TONE
YET SO NEAR IT WHISPERED IN MY HEART
MY DAUGHTER FLEE TEMPTATION
MOTHER I WILL
SO I ANSWERED AFTER I HAD WAKED FROM THE TRANCE LIKE DREAM
IT WAS YET
NIGHT BUT JULY NIGHTS ARE SHORT SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT DAWN COMES
IT
CANNOT BE TOO EARLY TO COMMENCE THE TASK I HAVE TO FULFIL THOUGHT I
I
ROSE I WAS DRESSED FOR I HAD TAKEN OFF NOTHING BUT MY SHOES
I KNEW
WHERE TO FIND IN MY DRAWERS SOME LINEN A LOCKET A RING
IN SEEKING
THESE ARTICLES I ENCOUNTERED THE BEADS OF A PEARL NECKLACE MR
ROCHESTER
HAD FORCED ME TO ACCEPT A FEW DAYS AGO
I LEFT THAT IT WAS NOT MINE IT
WAS THE VISIONARY BRIDE'S WHO HAD MELTED IN AIR
THE OTHER ARTICLES I
MADE UP IN A PARCEL MY PURSE CONTAINING TWENTY SHILLINGS IT WAS ALL I
HAD I PUT IN MY POCKET I TIED ON MY STRAW BONNET PINNED MY SHAWL
TOOK THE PARCEL AND MY SLIPPERS WHICH I WOULD NOT PUT ON YET AND STOLE
FROM MY ROOM
FAREWELL KIND MRS
FAIRFAX I WHISPERED AS I GLIDED PAST HER DOOR
FAREWELL MY DARLING ADELE I SAID AS I GLANCED TOWARDS THE NURSERY
NO THOUGHT COULD BE ADMITTED OF ENTERING TO EMBRACE HER
I HAD TO
DECEIVE A FINE EAR FOR AUGHT I KNEW IT MIGHT NOW BE LISTENING
I WOULD HAVE GOT PAST MR
ROCHESTER'S CHAMBER WITHOUT A PAUSE BUT MY
HEART MOMENTARILY STOPPING ITS BEAT AT THAT THRESHOLD MY FOOT WAS FORCED
TO STOP ALSO
NO SLEEP WAS THERE THE INMATE WAS WALKING RESTLESSLY FROM
WALL TO WALL AND AGAIN AND AGAIN HE SIGHED WHILE I LISTENED
THERE WAS
A HEAVEN A TEMPORARY HEAVEN IN THIS ROOM FOR ME IF I CHOSE I HAD BUT
TO GO IN AND TO SAY
MR
ROCHESTER I WILL LOVE YOU AND LIVE WITH YOU THROUGH LIFE TILL
DEATH AND A FOUNT OF RAPTURE WOULD SPRING TO MY LIPS
I THOUGHT OF
THIS
THAT KIND MASTER WHO COULD NOT SLEEP NOW WAS WAITING WITH IMPATIENCE
FOR DAY
HE WOULD SEND FOR ME IN THE MORNING I SHOULD BE GONE
HE
WOULD HAVE ME SOUGHT FOR VAINLY
HE WOULD FEEL HIMSELF FORSAKEN HIS
LOVE REJECTED HE WOULD SUFFER PERHAPS GROW DESPERATE
I THOUGHT OF
THIS TOO
MY HAND MOVED TOWARDS THE LOCK I CAUGHT IT BACK AND GLIDED
ON
DREARILY I WOUND MY WAY DOWNSTAIRS I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO AND I DID IT
MECHANICALLY
I SOUGHT THE KEY OF THE SIDE DOOR IN THE KITCHEN I
SOUGHT TOO A PHIAL OF OIL AND A FEATHER I OILED THE KEY AND THE LOCK
I GOT SOME WATER I GOT SOME BREAD FOR PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE TO WALK
FAR AND MY STRENGTH SORELY SHAKEN OF LATE MUST NOT BREAK DOWN
ALL
THIS I DID WITHOUT ONE SOUND
I OPENED THE DOOR PASSED OUT SHUT IT
SOFTLY
DIM DAWN GLIMMERED IN THE YARD
THE GREAT GATES WERE CLOSED AND
LOCKED BUT A WICKET IN ONE OF THEM WAS ONLY LATCHED
THROUGH THAT I
DEPARTED IT TOO I SHUT AND NOW I WAS OUT OF THORNFIELD
A MILE OFF BEYOND THE FIELDS LAY A ROAD WHICH STRETCHED IN THE CONTRARY
DIRECTION TO MILLCOTE A ROAD I HAD NEVER TRAVELLED BUT OFTEN NOTICED
AND WONDERED WHERE IT LED THITHER I BENT MY STEPS
NO REFLECTION WAS TO
BE ALLOWED NOW NOT ONE GLANCE WAS TO BE CAST BACK NOT EVEN ONE FORWARD
NOT ONE THOUGHT WAS TO BE GIVEN EITHER TO THE PAST OR THE FUTURE
THE
FIRST WAS A PAGE SO HEAVENLY SWEET SO DEADLY SAD THAT TO READ ONE LINE
OF IT WOULD DISSOLVE MY COURAGE AND BREAK DOWN MY ENERGY
THE LAST WAS
AN AWFUL BLANK SOMETHING LIKE THE WORLD WHEN THE DELUGE WAS GONE BY
I SKIRTED FIELDS AND HEDGES AND LANES TILL AFTER SUNRISE
I BELIEVE IT
WAS A LOVELY SUMMER MORNING I KNOW MY SHOES WHICH I HAD PUT ON WHEN I
LEFT THE HOUSE WERE SOON WET WITH DEW
BUT I LOOKED NEITHER TO RISING
SUN NOR SMILING SKY NOR WAKENING NATURE
HE WHO IS TAKEN OUT TO PASS
THROUGH A FAIR SCENE TO THE SCAFFOLD THINKS NOT OF THE FLOWERS THAT
SMILE ON HIS ROAD BUT OF THE BLOCK AND AXE EDGE OF THE DISSEVERMENT OF
BONE AND VEIN OF THE GRAVE GAPING AT THE END AND I THOUGHT OF DREAR
FLIGHT AND HOMELESS WANDERING AND OH WITH AGONY I THOUGHT OF WHAT I
LEFT
I COULD NOT HELP IT
I THOUGHT OF HIM NOW IN HIS ROOM WATCHING
THE SUNRISE HOPING I SHOULD SOON COME TO SAY I WOULD STAY WITH HIM AND
BE HIS
I LONGED TO BE HIS I PANTED TO RETURN IT WAS NOT TOO LATE I
COULD YET SPARE HIM THE BITTER PANG OF BEREAVEMENT
AS YET MY FLIGHT I
WAS SURE WAS UNDISCOVERED
I COULD GO BACK AND BE HIS COMFORTER HIS
PRIDE HIS REDEEMER FROM MISERY PERHAPS FROM RUIN
OH THAT FEAR OF HIS
SELF ABANDONMENT FAR WORSE THAN MY ABANDONMENT HOW IT GOADED ME IT
WAS A BARBED ARROW HEAD IN MY BREAST IT TORE ME WHEN I TRIED TO EXTRACT
IT IT SICKENED ME WHEN REMEMBRANCE THRUST IT FARTHER IN
BIRDS BEGAN
SINGING IN BRAKE AND COPSE BIRDS WERE FAITHFUL TO THEIR MATES BIRDS
WERE EMBLEMS OF LOVE
WHAT WAS I IN THE MIDST OF MY PAIN OF HEART AND
FRANTIC EFFORT OF PRINCIPLE I ABHORRED MYSELF
I HAD NO SOLACE FROM
SELF APPROBATION NONE EVEN FROM SELF RESPECT
I HAD
INJURED WOUNDED LEFT MY MASTER
I WAS HATEFUL IN MY OWN EYES
STILL I
COULD NOT TURN NOR RETRACE ONE STEP
GOD MUST HAVE LED ME ON
AS TO MY
OWN WILL OR CONSCIENCE IMPASSIONED GRIEF HAD TRAMPLED ONE AND STIFLED
THE OTHER
I WAS WEEPING WILDLY AS I WALKED ALONG MY SOLITARY WAY FAST
FAST I WENT LIKE ONE DELIRIOUS
A WEAKNESS BEGINNING INWARDLY
EXTENDING TO THE LIMBS SEIZED ME AND I FELL I LAY ON THE GROUND SOME
MINUTES PRESSING MY FACE TO THE WET TURF
I HAD SOME FEAR OR HOPE THAT
HERE I SHOULD DIE BUT I WAS SOON UP CRAWLING FORWARDS ON MY HANDS AND
KNEES AND THEN AGAIN RAISED TO MY FEET AS EAGER AND AS DETERMINED AS
EVER TO REACH THE ROAD
WHEN I GOT THERE I WAS FORCED TO SIT TO REST ME UNDER THE HEDGE AND
WHILE I SAT I HEARD WHEELS AND SAW A COACH COME ON
I STOOD UP AND
LIFTED MY HAND IT STOPPED
I ASKED WHERE IT WAS GOING THE DRIVER NAMED
A PLACE A LONG WAY OFF AND WHERE I WAS SURE MR
ROCHESTER HAD NO
CONNECTIONS
I ASKED FOR WHAT SUM HE WOULD TAKE ME THERE HE SAID THIRTY
SHILLINGS I ANSWERED I HAD BUT TWENTY WELL HE WOULD TRY TO MAKE IT DO
HE FURTHER GAVE ME LEAVE TO GET INTO THE INSIDE AS THE VEHICLE WAS
EMPTY I ENTERED WAS SHUT IN AND IT ROLLED ON ITS WAY
GENTLE READER MAY YOU NEVER FEEL WHAT I THEN FELT MAY YOUR EYES NEVER
SHED SUCH STORMY SCALDING HEART WRUNG TEARS AS POURED FROM MINE
MAY
YOU NEVER APPEAL TO HEAVEN IN PRAYERS SO HOPELESS AND SO AGONISED AS IN
THAT HOUR LEFT MY LIPS FOR NEVER MAY YOU LIKE ME DREAD TO BE THE
INSTRUMENT OF EVIL TO WHAT YOU WHOLLY LOVE
CHAPTER XXVIII
TWO DAYS ARE PASSED
IT IS A SUMMER EVENING THE COACHMAN HAS SET ME
DOWN AT A PLACE CALLED WHITCROSS HE COULD TAKE ME NO FARTHER FOR THE SUM
I HAD GIVEN AND I WAS NOT POSSESSED OF ANOTHER SHILLING IN THE WORLD
THE COACH IS A MILE OFF BY THIS TIME I AM ALONE
AT THIS MOMENT I
DISCOVER THAT I FORGOT TO TAKE MY PARCEL OUT OF THE POCKET OF THE COACH
WHERE I HAD PLACED IT FOR SAFETY THERE IT REMAINS THERE IT MUST REMAIN
AND NOW I AM ABSOLUTELY DESTITUTE
WHITCROSS IS NO TOWN NOR EVEN A HAMLET IT IS BUT A STONE PILLAR SET UP
WHERE FOUR ROADS MEET WHITEWASHED I SUPPOSE TO BE MORE OBVIOUS AT A
DISTANCE AND IN DARKNESS
FOUR ARMS SPRING FROM ITS SUMMIT THE NEAREST
TOWN TO WHICH THESE POINT IS ACCORDING TO THE INSCRIPTION DISTANT TEN
MILES THE FARTHEST ABOVE TWENTY
FROM THE WELL KNOWN NAMES OF THESE
TOWNS I LEARN IN WHAT COUNTY I HAVE LIGHTED A NORTH MIDLAND SHIRE DUSK
WITH MOORLAND RIDGED WITH MOUNTAIN THIS I SEE
THERE ARE GREAT MOORS
BEHIND AND ON EACH HAND OF ME THERE ARE WAVES OF MOUNTAINS FAR BEYOND
THAT DEEP VALLEY AT MY FEET
THE POPULATION HERE MUST BE THIN AND I SEE
NO PASSENGERS ON THESE ROADS THEY STRETCH OUT EAST WEST NORTH AND
SOUTH WHITE BROAD LONELY THEY ARE ALL CUT IN THE MOOR AND THE
HEATHER GROWS DEEP AND WILD TO THEIR VERY VERGE
YET A CHANCE TRAVELLER
MIGHT PASS BY AND I WISH NO EYE TO SEE ME NOW STRANGERS WOULD WONDER
WHAT I AM DOING LINGERING HERE AT THE SIGN POST EVIDENTLY OBJECTLESS
AND LOST
I MIGHT BE QUESTIONED I COULD GIVE NO ANSWER BUT WHAT WOULD
SOUND INCREDIBLE AND EXCITE SUSPICION
NOT A TIE HOLDS ME TO HUMAN
SOCIETY AT THIS MOMENT NOT A CHARM OR HOPE CALLS ME WHERE MY
FELLOW CREATURES ARE NONE THAT SAW ME WOULD HAVE A KIND THOUGHT OR A
GOOD WISH FOR ME
I HAVE NO RELATIVE BUT THE UNIVERSAL MOTHER NATURE I
WILL SEEK HER BREAST AND ASK REPOSE
I STRUCK STRAIGHT INTO THE HEATH I HELD ON TO A HOLLOW I SAW DEEPLY
FURROWING THE BROWN MOORSIDE I WADED KNEE DEEP IN ITS DARK GROWTH I
TURNED WITH ITS TURNINGS AND FINDING A MOSS BLACKENED GRANITE CRAG IN A
HIDDEN ANGLE I SAT DOWN UNDER IT
HIGH BANKS OF MOOR WERE ABOUT ME THE
CRAG PROTECTED MY HEAD THE SKY WAS OVER THAT
SOME TIME PASSED BEFORE I FELT TRANQUIL EVEN HERE I HAD A VAGUE DREAD
THAT WILD CATTLE MIGHT BE NEAR OR THAT SOME SPORTSMAN OR POACHER MIGHT
DISCOVER ME
IF A GUST OF WIND SWEPT THE WASTE I LOOKED UP FEARING IT
WAS THE RUSH OF A BULL IF A PLOVER WHISTLED I IMAGINED IT A MAN
FINDING MY APPREHENSIONS UNFOUNDED HOWEVER AND CALMED BY THE DEEP
SILENCE THAT REIGNED AS EVENING DECLINED AT NIGHTFALL I TOOK CONFIDENCE
AS YET I HAD NOT THOUGHT I HAD ONLY LISTENED WATCHED DREADED NOW I
REGAINED THE FACULTY OF REFLECTION
WHAT WAS I TO DO WHERE TO GO OH INTOLERABLE QUESTIONS WHEN I COULD
DO NOTHING AND GO NOWHERE WHEN A LONG WAY MUST YET BE MEASURED BY MY
WEARY TREMBLING LIMBS BEFORE I COULD REACH HUMAN HABITATION WHEN COLD
CHARITY MUST BE ENTREATED BEFORE I COULD GET A LODGING RELUCTANT
SYMPATHY IMPORTUNED ALMOST CERTAIN REPULSE INCURRED BEFORE MY TALE
COULD BE LISTENED TO OR ONE OF MY WANTS RELIEVED
I TOUCHED THE HEATH IT WAS DRY AND YET WARM WITH THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER
DAY
I LOOKED AT THE SKY IT WAS PURE A KINDLY STAR TWINKLED JUST ABOVE
THE CHASM RIDGE
THE DEW FELL BUT WITH PROPITIOUS SOFTNESS NO BREEZE
WHISPERED
NATURE SEEMED TO ME BENIGN AND GOOD I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME
OUTCAST AS I WAS AND I WHO FROM MAN COULD ANTICIPATE ONLY MISTRUST
REJECTION INSULT CLUNG TO HER WITH FILIAL FONDNESS
TO NIGHT AT
LEAST I WOULD BE HER GUEST AS I WAS HER CHILD MY MOTHER WOULD LODGE ME
WITHOUT MONEY AND WITHOUT PRICE
I HAD ONE MORSEL OF BREAD YET THE
REMNANT OF A ROLL I HAD BOUGHT IN A TOWN WE PASSED THROUGH AT NOON WITH A
STRAY PENNY MY LAST COIN
I SAW RIPE BILBERRIES GLEAMING HERE AND
THERE LIKE JET BEADS IN THE HEATH I GATHERED A HANDFUL AND ATE THEM
WITH THE BREAD
MY HUNGER SHARP BEFORE WAS IF NOT SATISFIED APPEASED
BY THIS HERMIT'S MEAL
I SAID MY EVENING PRAYERS AT ITS CONCLUSION AND
THEN CHOSE MY COUCH
I SAID MY EVENING PRAYERS P311 JPG
BESIDE THE CRAG THE HEATH WAS VERY DEEP WHEN I LAY DOWN MY FEET WERE
BURIED IN IT RISING HIGH ON EACH SIDE IT LEFT ONLY A NARROW SPACE FOR
THE NIGHT AIR TO INVADE
I FOLDED MY SHAWL DOUBLE AND SPREAD IT OVER ME
FOR A COVERLET A LOW MOSSY SWELL WAS MY PILLOW
THUS LODGED I WAS
NOT AT LEAST AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE NIGHT COLD
MY REST MIGHT HAVE BEEN BLISSFUL ENOUGH ONLY A SAD HEART BROKE IT
IT
PLAINED OF ITS GAPING WOUNDS ITS INWARD BLEEDING ITS RIVEN CHORDS
IT
TREMBLED FOR MR
ROCHESTER AND HIS DOOM IT BEMOANED HIM WITH BITTER
PITY IT DEMANDED HIM WITH CEASELESS LONGING AND IMPOTENT AS A BIRD
WITH BOTH WINGS BROKEN IT STILL QUIVERED ITS SHATTERED PINIONS IN VAIN
ATTEMPTS TO SEEK HIM
WORN OUT WITH THIS TORTURE OF THOUGHT I ROSE TO MY KNEES
NIGHT WAS
COME AND HER PLANETS WERE RISEN A SAFE STILL NIGHT TOO SERENE FOR THE
COMPANIONSHIP OF FEAR
WE KNOW THAT GOD IS EVERYWHERE BUT CERTAINLY WE
FEEL HIS PRESENCE MOST WHEN HIS WORKS ARE ON THE GRANDEST SCALE SPREAD
BEFORE US AND IT IS IN THE UNCLOUDED NIGHT SKY WHERE HIS WORLDS WHEEL
THEIR SILENT COURSE THAT WE READ CLEAREST HIS INFINITUDE HIS
OMNIPOTENCE HIS OMNIPRESENCE
I HAD RISEN TO MY KNEES TO PRAY FOR MR
ROCHESTER
LOOKING UP I WITH TEAR DIMMED EYES SAW THE MIGHTY MILKY
WAY
REMEMBERING WHAT IT WAS WHAT COUNTLESS SYSTEMS THERE SWEPT SPACE
LIKE A SOFT TRACE OF LIGHT I FELT THE MIGHT AND STRENGTH OF GOD
SURE
WAS I OF HIS EFFICIENCY TO SAVE WHAT HE HAD MADE CONVINCED I GREW THAT
NEITHER EARTH SHOULD PERISH NOR ONE OF THE SOULS IT TREASURED
I TURNED
MY PRAYER TO THANKSGIVING THE SOURCE OF LIFE WAS ALSO THE SAVIOUR OF
SPIRITS
MR
ROCHESTER WAS SAFE HE WAS GOD'S AND BY GOD WOULD HE BE
GUARDED
I AGAIN NESTLED TO THE BREAST OF THE HILL AND ERE LONG IN
SLEEP FORGOT SORROW
BUT NEXT DAY WANT CAME TO ME PALE AND BARE
LONG AFTER THE LITTLE BIRDS
HAD LEFT THEIR NESTS LONG AFTER BEES HAD COME IN THE SWEET PRIME OF DAY
TO GATHER THE HEATH HONEY BEFORE THE DEW WAS DRIED WHEN THE LONG MORNING
SHADOWS WERE CURTAILED AND THE SUN FILLED EARTH AND SKY I GOT UP AND I
LOOKED ROUND ME
WHAT A STILL HOT PERFECT DAY WHAT A GOLDEN DESERT THIS SPREADING
MOOR EVERYWHERE SUNSHINE
I WISHED I COULD LIVE IN IT AND ON IT
I
SAW A LIZARD RUN OVER THE CRAG I SAW A BEE BUSY AMONG THE SWEET
BILBERRIES
I WOULD FAIN AT THE MOMENT HAVE BECOME BEE OR LIZARD THAT I
MIGHT HAVE FOUND FITTING NUTRIMENT PERMANENT SHELTER HERE
BUT I WAS A
HUMAN BEING AND HAD A HUMAN BEING'S WANTS I MUST NOT LINGER WHERE THERE
WAS NOTHING TO SUPPLY THEM
I ROSE I LOOKED BACK AT THE BED I HAD LEFT
HOPELESS OF THE FUTURE I WISHED BUT THIS THAT MY MAKER HAD THAT NIGHT
THOUGHT GOOD TO REQUIRE MY SOUL OF ME WHILE I SLEPT AND THAT THIS WEARY
FRAME ABSOLVED BY DEATH FROM FURTHER CONFLICT WITH FATE HAD NOW BUT TO
DECAY QUIETLY AND MINGLE IN PEACE WITH THE SOIL OF THIS WILDERNESS
LIFE HOWEVER WAS YET IN MY POSSESSION WITH ALL ITS REQUIREMENTS AND
PAINS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
THE BURDEN MUST BE CARRIED THE WANT
PROVIDED FOR THE SUFFERING ENDURED THE RESPONSIBILITY FULFILLED
I SET
OUT
WHITCROSS REGAINED I FOLLOWED A ROAD WHICH LED FROM THE SUN NOW FERVENT
AND HIGH
BY NO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE HAD I WILL TO DECIDE MY CHOICE
I
WALKED A LONG TIME AND WHEN I THOUGHT I HAD NEARLY DONE ENOUGH AND
MIGHT CONSCIENTIOUSLY YIELD TO THE FATIGUE THAT ALMOST OVERPOWERED
ME MIGHT RELAX THIS FORCED ACTION AND SITTING DOWN ON A STONE I SAW
NEAR SUBMIT RESISTLESSLY TO THE APATHY THAT CLOGGED HEART AND LIMB I
HEARD A BELL CHIME A CHURCH BELL
I TURNED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND AND THERE AMONGST THE ROMANTIC
HILLS WHOSE CHANGES AND ASPECT I HAD CEASED TO NOTE AN HOUR AGO I SAW A
HAMLET AND A SPIRE
ALL THE VALLEY AT MY RIGHT HAND WAS FULL OF PASTURE
FIELDS AND CORNFIELDS AND WOOD AND A GLITTERING STREAM RAN ZIG ZAG
THROUGH THE VARIED SHADES OF GREEN THE MELLOWING GRAIN THE SOMBRE
WOODLAND THE CLEAR AND SUNNY LEA
RECALLED BY THE RUMBLING OF WHEELS TO
THE ROAD BEFORE ME I SAW A HEAVILY LADEN WAGGON LABOURING UP THE HILL
AND NOT FAR BEYOND WERE TWO COWS AND THEIR DROVER
HUMAN LIFE AND HUMAN
LABOUR WERE NEAR
I MUST STRUGGLE ON STRIVE TO LIVE AND BEND TO TOIL
LIKE THE REST
ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK P M
I ENTERED THE VILLAGE
AT THE BOTTOM OF ITS ONE
STREET THERE WAS A LITTLE SHOP WITH SOME CAKES OF BREAD IN THE WINDOW
I
COVETED A CAKE OF BREAD
WITH THAT REFRESHMENT I COULD PERHAPS REGAIN A
DEGREE OF ENERGY WITHOUT IT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PROCEED
THE WISH
TO HAVE SOME STRENGTH AND SOME VIGOUR RETURNED TO ME AS SOON AS I WAS
AMONGST MY FELLOW BEINGS
I FELT IT WOULD BE DEGRADING TO FAINT WITH
HUNGER ON THE CAUSEWAY OF A HAMLET
HAD I NOTHING ABOUT ME I COULD OFFER
IN EXCHANGE FOR ONE OF THESE ROLLS I CONSIDERED
I HAD A SMALL SILK
HANDKERCHIEF TIED ROUND MY THROAT I HAD MY GLOVES
I COULD HARDLY TELL
HOW MEN AND WOMEN IN EXTREMITIES OF DESTITUTION PROCEEDED
I DID NOT
KNOW WHETHER EITHER OF THESE ARTICLES WOULD BE ACCEPTED PROBABLY THEY
WOULD NOT BUT I MUST TRY
I ENTERED THE SHOP A WOMAN WAS THERE
SEEING A RESPECTABLY DRESSED
PERSON A LADY AS SHE SUPPOSED SHE CAME FORWARD WITH CIVILITY
HOW
COULD SHE SERVE ME I WAS SEIZED WITH SHAME MY TONGUE WOULD NOT UTTER
THE REQUEST I HAD PREPARED
I DARED NOT OFFER HER THE HALF WORN GLOVES
THE CREASED HANDKERCHIEF BESIDES I FELT IT WOULD BE ABSURD
I ONLY
BEGGED PERMISSION TO SIT DOWN A MOMENT AS I WAS TIRED
DISAPPOINTED IN
THE EXPECTATION OF A CUSTOMER SHE COOLLY ACCEDED TO MY REQUEST
SHE
POINTED TO A SEAT I SANK INTO IT
I FELT SORELY URGED TO WEEP BUT
CONSCIOUS HOW UNSEASONABLE SUCH A MANIFESTATION WOULD BE I RESTRAINED
IT
SOON I ASKED HER IF THERE WERE ANY DRESSMAKER OR PLAIN WORKWOMAN IN
THE VILLAGE
YES TWO OR THREE
QUITE AS MANY AS THERE WAS EMPLOYMENT FOR
I REFLECTED
I WAS DRIVEN TO THE POINT NOW
I WAS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE
WITH NECESSITY
I STOOD IN THE POSITION OF ONE WITHOUT A RESOURCE
WITHOUT A FRIEND WITHOUT A COIN
I MUST DO SOMETHING
WHAT I MUST
APPLY SOMEWHERE
WHERE
DID SHE KNOW OF ANY PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE A SERVANT WAS
WANTED
NAY SHE COULDN'T SAY
WHAT WAS THE CHIEF TRADE IN THIS PLACE WHAT DID MOST OF THE PEOPLE
DO
SOME WERE FARM LABOURERS A GOOD DEAL WORKED AT MR
OLIVER'S
NEEDLE FACTORY AND AT THE FOUNDRY
DID MR
OLIVER EMPLOY WOMEN
NAY IT WAS MEN'S WORK
AND WHAT DO THE WOMEN DO
I KNAWN'T WAS THE ANSWER
SOME DOES ONE THING AND SOME ANOTHER
POOR FOLK MUN GET ON AS THEY CAN
SHE SEEMED TO BE TIRED OF MY QUESTIONS AND INDEED WHAT CLAIM HAD I TO
IMPORTUNE HER A NEIGHBOUR OR TWO CAME IN MY CHAIR WAS EVIDENTLY
WANTED
I TOOK LEAVE
I PASSED UP THE STREET LOOKING AS I WENT AT ALL THE HOUSES TO THE RIGHT
HAND AND TO THE LEFT BUT I COULD DISCOVER NO PRETEXT NOR SEE AN
INDUCEMENT TO ENTER ANY
I RAMBLED ROUND THE HAMLET GOING SOMETIMES TO
A LITTLE DISTANCE AND RETURNING AGAIN FOR AN HOUR OR MORE
MUCH
EXHAUSTED AND SUFFERING GREATLY NOW FOR WANT OF FOOD I TURNED ASIDE
INTO A LANE AND SAT DOWN UNDER THE HEDGE
ERE MANY MINUTES HAD ELAPSED
I WAS AGAIN ON MY FEET HOWEVER AND AGAIN SEARCHING SOMETHING A
RESOURCE OR AT LEAST AN INFORMANT
A PRETTY LITTLE HOUSE STOOD AT THE
TOP OF THE LANE WITH A GARDEN BEFORE IT EXQUISITELY NEAT AND
BRILLIANTLY BLOOMING
I STOPPED AT IT
WHAT BUSINESS HAD I TO APPROACH
THE WHITE DOOR OR TOUCH THE GLITTERING KNOCKER IN WHAT WAY COULD IT
POSSIBLY BE THE INTEREST OF THE INHABITANTS OF THAT DWELLING TO SERVE ME
YET I DREW NEAR AND KNOCKED
A MILD LOOKING CLEANLY ATTIRED YOUNG WOMAN
OPENED THE DOOR
IN SUCH A VOICE AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM A HOPELESS
HEART AND FAINTING FRAME A VOICE WRETCHEDLY LOW AND FALTERING I ASKED
IF A SERVANT WAS WANTED HERE
NO SAID SHE WE DO NOT KEEP A SERVANT
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I COULD GET EMPLOYMENT OF ANY KIND I CONTINUED
I AM A STRANGER WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE IN THIS PLACE
I WANT SOME WORK
NO MATTER WHAT
BUT IT WAS NOT HER BUSINESS TO THINK FOR ME OR TO SEEK A PLACE FOR ME
BESIDES IN HER EYES HOW DOUBTFUL MUST HAVE APPEARED MY CHARACTER
POSITION TALE
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SHE WAS SORRY SHE COULD GIVE ME NO
INFORMATION AND THE WHITE DOOR CLOSED QUITE GENTLY AND CIVILLY BUT IT
SHUT ME OUT
IF SHE HAD HELD IT OPEN A LITTLE LONGER I BELIEVE I SHOULD
HAVE BEGGED A PIECE OF BREAD FOR I WAS NOW BROUGHT LOW
I COULD NOT BEAR TO RETURN TO THE SORDID VILLAGE WHERE BESIDES NO
PROSPECT OF AID WAS VISIBLE
I SHOULD HAVE LONGED RATHER TO DEVIATE TO A
WOOD I SAW NOT FAR OFF WHICH APPEARED IN ITS THICK SHADE TO OFFER
INVITING SHELTER BUT I WAS SO SICK SO WEAK SO GNAWED WITH NATURE'S
CRAVINGS INSTINCT KEPT ME ROAMING ROUND ABODES WHERE THERE WAS A CHANCE
OF FOOD
SOLITUDE WOULD BE NO SOLITUDE REST NO REST WHILE THE VULTURE
HUNGER THUS SANK BEAK AND TALONS IN MY SIDE
I DREW NEAR HOUSES I LEFT THEM AND CAME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN I
WANDERED AWAY ALWAYS REPELLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING NO CLAIM TO
ASK NO RIGHT TO EXPECT INTEREST IN MY ISOLATED LOT
MEANTIME THE
AFTERNOON ADVANCED WHILE I THUS WANDERED ABOUT LIKE A LOST AND STARVING
DOG
IN CROSSING A FIELD I SAW THE CHURCH SPIRE BEFORE ME I HASTENED
TOWARDS IT
NEAR THE CHURCHYARD AND IN THE MIDDLE OF A GARDEN STOOD A
WELL BUILT THOUGH SMALL HOUSE WHICH I HAD NO DOUBT WAS THE PARSONAGE
I
REMEMBERED THAT STRANGERS WHO ARRIVE AT A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE NO
FRIENDS AND WHO WANT EMPLOYMENT SOMETIMES APPLY TO THE CLERGYMAN FOR
INTRODUCTION AND AID
IT IS THE CLERGYMAN'S FUNCTION TO HELP AT LEAST
WITH ADVICE THOSE WHO WISHED TO HELP THEMSELVES
I SEEMED TO HAVE
SOMETHING LIKE A RIGHT TO SEEK COUNSEL HERE
RENEWING THEN MY COURAGE
AND GATHERING MY FEEBLE REMAINS OF STRENGTH I PUSHED ON
I REACHED THE
HOUSE AND KNOCKED AT THE KITCHEN DOOR
AN OLD WOMAN OPENED I ASKED WAS
THIS THE PARSONAGE
YES
WAS THE CLERGYMAN IN
NO
WOULD HE BE IN SOON
NO HE WAS GONE FROM HOME
TO A DISTANCE
NOT SO FAR HAPPEN THREE MILE
HE HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY BY THE SUDDEN
DEATH OF HIS FATHER HE WAS AT MARSH END NOW AND WOULD VERY LIKELY STAY
THERE A FORTNIGHT LONGER
WAS THERE ANY LADY OF THE HOUSE
NAY THERE WAS NAUGHT BUT HER AND SHE WAS HOUSEKEEPER AND OF HER
READER I COULD NOT BEAR TO ASK THE RELIEF FOR WANT OF WHICH I WAS
SINKING I COULD NOT YET BEG AND AGAIN I CRAWLED AWAY
ONCE MORE I TOOK OFF MY HANDKERCHIEF ONCE MORE I THOUGHT OF THE CAKES OF
BREAD IN THE LITTLE SHOP
OH FOR BUT A CRUST FOR BUT ONE MOUTHFUL TO
ALLAY THE PANG OF FAMINE INSTINCTIVELY I TURNED MY FACE AGAIN TO THE
VILLAGE I FOUND THE SHOP AGAIN AND I WENT IN AND THOUGH OTHERS WERE
THERE BESIDES THE WOMAN I VENTURED THE REQUEST WOULD SHE GIVE ME A ROLL
FOR THIS HANDKERCHIEF
SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH EVIDENT SUSPICION NAY SHE NEVER SOLD STUFF I'
THAT WAY
ALMOST DESPERATE I ASKED FOR HALF A CAKE SHE AGAIN REFUSED
HOW COULD
SHE TELL WHERE I HAD GOT THE HANDKERCHIEF SHE SAID
WOULD SHE TAKE MY GLOVES
NO WHAT COULD SHE DO WITH THEM
READER IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO DWELL ON THESE DETAILS
SOME SAY THERE IS
ENJOYMENT IN LOOKING BACK TO PAINFUL EXPERIENCE PAST BUT AT THIS DAY I
CAN SCARCELY BEAR TO REVIEW THE TIMES TO WHICH I ALLUDE THE MORAL
DEGRADATION BLENT WITH THE PHYSICAL SUFFERING FORM TOO DISTRESSING A
RECOLLECTION EVER TO BE WILLINGLY DWELT ON
I BLAMED NONE OF THOSE WHO
REPULSED ME
I FELT IT WAS WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED AND WHAT COULD NOT
BE HELPED AN ORDINARY BEGGAR IS FREQUENTLY AN OBJECT OF SUSPICION A
WELL DRESSED BEGGAR INEVITABLY SO
TO BE SURE WHAT I BEGGED WAS
EMPLOYMENT BUT WHOSE BUSINESS WAS IT TO PROVIDE ME WITH EMPLOYMENT NOT
CERTAINLY THAT OF PERSONS WHO SAW ME THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WHO
KNEW NOTHING ABOUT MY CHARACTER
AND AS TO THE WOMAN WHO WOULD NOT TAKE
MY HANDKERCHIEF IN EXCHANGE FOR HER BREAD WHY SHE WAS RIGHT IF THE
OFFER APPEARED TO HER SINISTER OR THE EXCHANGE UNPROFITABLE
LET ME
CONDENSE NOW
I AM SICK OF THE SUBJECT
A LITTLE BEFORE DARK I PASSED A FARM HOUSE AT THE OPEN DOOR OF WHICH THE
FARMER WAS SITTING EATING HIS SUPPER OF BREAD AND CHEESE
I STOPPED AND
SAID
WILL YOU GIVE ME A PIECE OF BREAD FOR I AM VERY HUNGRY HE CAST ON ME
A GLANCE OF SURPRISE BUT WITHOUT ANSWERING HE CUT A THICK SLICE FROM
HIS LOAF AND GAVE IT TO ME
I IMAGINE HE DID NOT THINK I WAS A BEGGAR
BUT ONLY AN ECCENTRIC SORT OF LADY WHO HAD TAKEN A FANCY TO HIS BROWN
LOAF
AS SOON AS I WAS OUT OF SIGHT OF HIS HOUSE I SAT DOWN AND ATE IT
I COULD NOT HOPE TO GET A LODGING UNDER A ROOF AND SOUGHT IT IN THE WOOD
I HAVE BEFORE ALLUDED TO
BUT MY NIGHT WAS WRETCHED MY REST BROKEN THE
GROUND WAS DAMP THE AIR COLD BESIDES INTRUDERS PASSED NEAR ME MORE
THAN ONCE AND I HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN TO CHANGE MY QUARTERS NO SENSE OF
SAFETY OR TRANQUILLITY BEFRIENDED ME
TOWARDS MORNING IT RAINED THE
WHOLE OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS WET
DO NOT ASK ME READER TO GIVE A
MINUTE ACCOUNT OF THAT DAY AS BEFORE I SOUGHT WORK AS BEFORE I WAS
REPULSED AS BEFORE I STARVED BUT ONCE DID FOOD PASS MY LIPS
AT THE
DOOR OF A COTTAGE I SAW A LITTLE GIRL ABOUT TO THROW A MESS OF COLD
PORRIDGE INTO A PIG TROUGH
WILL YOU GIVE ME THAT I ASKED
WILL YOU GIVE ME THAT I ASKED P316 JPG
SHE STARED AT ME
MOTHER SHE EXCLAIMED THERE IS A WOMAN WANTS ME TO
GIVE HER THESE PORRIDGE
WELL LASS REPLIED A VOICE WITHIN GIVE IT HER IF SHE'S A BEGGAR
T'
PIG DOESN'T WANT IT
THE GIRL EMPTIED THE STIFFENED MOULD INTO MY HAND AND I DEVOURED IT
RAVENOUSLY
AS THE WET TWILIGHT DEEPENED I STOPPED IN A SOLITARY BRIDLE PATH WHICH
I HAD BEEN PURSUING AN HOUR OR MORE
MY STRENGTH IS QUITE FAILING ME I SAID IN A SOLILOQUY
I FEEL I
CANNOT GO MUCH FARTHER
SHALL I BE AN OUTCAST AGAIN THIS NIGHT WHILE
THE RAIN DESCENDS SO MUST I LAY MY HEAD ON THE COLD DRENCHED GROUND I
FEAR I CANNOT DO OTHERWISE FOR WHO WILL RECEIVE ME BUT IT WILL BE VERY
DREADFUL WITH THIS FEELING OF HUNGER FAINTNESS CHILL AND THIS SENSE
OF DESOLATION THIS TOTAL PROSTRATION OF HOPE
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD
THOUGH I SHOULD DIE BEFORE MORNING
AND WHY CANNOT I RECONCILE MYSELF
TO THE PROSPECT OF DEATH WHY DO I STRUGGLE TO RETAIN A VALUELESS LIFE
BECAUSE I KNOW OR BELIEVE MR
ROCHESTER IS LIVING AND THEN TO DIE OF
WANT AND COLD IS A FATE TO WHICH NATURE CANNOT SUBMIT PASSIVELY
OH
PROVIDENCE SUSTAIN ME A LITTLE LONGER AID DIRECT ME
MY GLAZED EYE WANDERED OVER THE DIM AND MISTY LANDSCAPE
I SAW I HAD
STRAYED FAR FROM THE VILLAGE IT WAS QUITE OUT OF SIGHT
THE VERY
CULTIVATION SURROUNDING IT HAD DISAPPEARED
I HAD BY CROSS WAYS AND BY
PATHS ONCE MORE DRAWN NEAR THE TRACT OF MOORLAND AND NOW ONLY A FEW
FIELDS ALMOST AS WILD AND UNPRODUCTIVE AS THE HEATH FROM WHICH THEY WERE
SCARCELY RECLAIMED LAY BETWEEN ME AND THE DUSKY HILL
WELL I WOULD RATHER DIE YONDER THAN IN A STREET OR ON A FREQUENTED
ROAD I REFLECTED
AND FAR BETTER THAT CROWS AND RAVENS IF ANY RAVENS
THERE BE IN THESE REGIONS SHOULD PICK MY FLESH FROM MY BONES THAN THAT
THEY SHOULD BE PRISONED IN A WORKHOUSE COFFIN AND MOULDER IN A PAUPER'S
GRAVE
TO THE HILL THEN I TURNED
I REACHED IT
IT REMAINED NOW ONLY TO FIND
A HOLLOW WHERE I COULD LIE DOWN AND FEEL AT LEAST HIDDEN IF NOT SECURE
BUT ALL THE SURFACE OF THE WASTE LOOKED LEVEL
IT SHOWED NO VARIATION
BUT OF TINT GREEN WHERE RUSH AND MOSS OVERGREW THE MARSHES BLACK
WHERE THE DRY SOIL BORE ONLY HEATH
DARK AS IT WAS GETTING I COULD
STILL SEE THESE CHANGES THOUGH BUT AS MERE ALTERNATIONS OF LIGHT AND
SHADE FOR COLOUR HAD FADED WITH THE DAYLIGHT
MY EYE STILL ROVED OVER THE SULLEN SWELL AND ALONG THE MOOR EDGE
VANISHING AMIDST THE WILDEST SCENERY WHEN AT ONE DIM POINT FAR IN AMONG
THE MARSHES AND THE RIDGES A LIGHT SPRANG UP
THAT IS AN IGNIS
FATUUS WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT AND I EXPECTED IT WOULD SOON VANISH
IT
BURNT ON HOWEVER QUITE STEADILY NEITHER RECEDING NOR ADVANCING
IS
IT THEN A BONFIRE JUST KINDLED I QUESTIONED
I WATCHED TO SEE
WHETHER IT WOULD SPREAD BUT NO AS IT DID NOT DIMINISH SO IT DID NOT
ENLARGE
IT MAY BE A CANDLE IN A HOUSE I THEN CONJECTURED BUT IF
SO I CAN NEVER REACH IT
IT IS MUCH TOO FAR AWAY AND WERE IT WITHIN A
YARD OF ME WHAT WOULD IT AVAIL I SHOULD BUT KNOCK AT THE DOOR TO HAVE
IT SHUT IN MY FACE
AND I SANK DOWN WHERE I STOOD AND HID MY FACE AGAINST THE GROUND
I LAY
STILL A WHILE THE NIGHT WIND SWEPT OVER THE HILL AND OVER ME AND DIED
MOANING IN THE DISTANCE THE RAIN FELL FAST WETTING ME AFRESH TO THE
SKIN
COULD I BUT HAVE STIFFENED TO THE STILL FROST THE FRIENDLY
NUMBNESS OF DEATH IT MIGHT HAVE PELTED ON I SHOULD NOT HAVE FELT IT
BUT MY YET LIVING FLESH SHUDDERED AT ITS CHILLING INFLUENCE
I ROSE ERE
LONG
THE LIGHT WAS YET THERE SHINING DIM BUT CONSTANT THROUGH THE RAIN
I
TRIED TO WALK AGAIN I DRAGGED MY EXHAUSTED LIMBS SLOWLY TOWARDS IT
IT
LED ME ASLANT OVER THE HILL THROUGH A WIDE BOG WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
IMPASSABLE IN WINTER AND WAS SPLASHY AND SHAKING EVEN NOW IN THE HEIGHT
OF SUMMER
HERE I FELL TWICE BUT AS OFTEN I ROSE AND RALLIED MY
FACULTIES
THIS LIGHT WAS MY FORLORN HOPE I MUST GAIN IT
HAVING CROSSED THE MARSH I SAW A TRACE OF WHITE OVER THE MOOR
I
APPROACHED IT IT WAS A ROAD OR A TRACK IT LED STRAIGHT UP TO THE LIGHT
WHICH NOW BEAMED FROM A SORT OF KNOLL AMIDST A CLUMP OF TREES FIRS
APPARENTLY FROM WHAT I COULD DISTINGUISH OF THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FORMS
AND FOLIAGE THROUGH THE GLOOM
MY STAR VANISHED AS I DREW NEAR SOME
OBSTACLE HAD INTERVENED BETWEEN ME AND IT
I PUT OUT MY HAND TO FEEL THE
DARK MASS BEFORE ME I DISCRIMINATED THE ROUGH STONES OF A LOW WALL ABOVE
IT SOMETHING LIKE PALISADES AND WITHIN A HIGH AND PRICKLY HEDGE
I
GROPED ON
AGAIN A WHITISH OBJECT GLEAMED BEFORE ME IT WAS A GATE A
WICKET IT MOVED ON ITS HINGES AS I TOUCHED IT
ON EACH SIDE STOOD A
SABLE BUSH HOLLY OR YEW
ENTERING THE GATE AND PASSING THE SHRUBS THE SILHOUETTE OF A HOUSE ROSE
TO VIEW BLACK LOW AND RATHER LONG BUT THE GUIDING LIGHT SHONE
NOWHERE
ALL WAS OBSCURITY
WERE THE INMATES RETIRED TO REST I FEARED
IT MUST BE SO
IN SEEKING THE DOOR I TURNED AN ANGLE THERE SHOT OUT
THE FRIENDLY GLEAM AGAIN FROM THE LOZENGED PANES OF A VERY SMALL
LATTICED WINDOW WITHIN A FOOT OF THE GROUND MADE STILL SMALLER BY THE
GROWTH OF IVY OR SOME OTHER CREEPING PLANT WHOSE LEAVES CLUSTERED THICK
OVER THE PORTION OF THE HOUSE WALL IN WHICH IT WAS SET
THE APERTURE WAS
SO SCREENED AND NARROW THAT CURTAIN OR SHUTTER HAD BEEN DEEMED
UNNECESSARY AND WHEN I STOOPED DOWN AND PUT ASIDE THE SPRAY OF FOLIAGE
SHOOTING OVER IT I COULD SEE ALL WITHIN
I COULD SEE CLEARLY A ROOM
WITH A SANDED FLOOR CLEAN SCOURED A DRESSER OF WALNUT WITH PEWTER
PLATES RANGED IN ROWS REFLECTING THE REDNESS AND RADIANCE OF A GLOWING
PEAT FIRE
I COULD SEE A CLOCK A WHITE DEAL TABLE SOME CHAIRS
THE
CANDLE WHOSE RAY HAD BEEN MY BEACON BURNT ON THE TABLE AND BY ITS
LIGHT AN ELDERLY WOMAN SOMEWHAT ROUGH LOOKING BUT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN
LIKE ALL ABOUT HER WAS KNITTING A STOCKING
I NOTICED THESE OBJECTS CURSORILY ONLY IN THEM THERE WAS NOTHING
EXTRAORDINARY
A GROUP OF MORE INTEREST APPEARED NEAR THE HEARTH
SITTING STILL AMIDST THE ROSY PEACE AND WARMTH SUFFUSING IT
TWO YOUNG
GRACEFUL WOMEN LADIES IN EVERY POINT SAT ONE IN A LOW ROCKING CHAIR
THE OTHER ON A LOWER STOOL BOTH WORE DEEP MOURNING OF CRAPE AND
BOMBAZEEN WHICH SOMBRE GARB SINGULARLY SET OFF VERY FAIR NECKS AND
FACES A LARGE OLD POINTER DOG RESTED ITS MASSIVE HEAD ON THE KNEE OF ONE
GIRL IN THE LAP OF THE OTHER WAS CUSHIONED A BLACK CAT
A STRANGE PLACE WAS THIS HUMBLE KITCHEN FOR SUCH OCCUPANTS WHO WERE
THEY THEY COULD NOT BE THE DAUGHTERS OF THE ELDERLY PERSON AT THE
TABLE FOR SHE LOOKED LIKE A RUSTIC AND THEY WERE ALL DELICACY AND
CULTIVATION
I HAD NOWHERE SEEN SUCH FACES AS THEIRS AND YET AS I
GAZED ON THEM I SEEMED INTIMATE WITH EVERY LINEAMENT
I CANNOT CALL
THEM HANDSOME THEY WERE TOO PALE AND GRAVE FOR THE WORD AS THEY EACH
BENT OVER A BOOK THEY LOOKED THOUGHTFUL ALMOST TO SEVERITY
A STAND
BETWEEN THEM SUPPORTED A SECOND CANDLE AND TWO GREAT VOLUMES TO WHICH
THEY FREQUENTLY REFERRED COMPARING THEM SEEMINGLY WITH THE SMALLER
BOOKS THEY HELD IN THEIR HANDS LIKE PEOPLE CONSULTING A DICTIONARY TO
AID THEM IN THE TASK OF TRANSLATION
THIS SCENE WAS AS SILENT AS IF ALL
THE FIGURES HAD BEEN SHADOWS AND THE FIRELIT APARTMENT A PICTURE SO
HUSHED WAS IT I COULD HEAR THE CINDERS FALL FROM THE GRATE THE CLOCK
TICK IN ITS OBSCURE CORNER AND I EVEN FANCIED I COULD DISTINGUISH THE
CLICK CLICK OF THE WOMAN'S KNITTING NEEDLES
WHEN THEREFORE A VOICE
BROKE THE STRANGE STILLNESS AT LAST IT WAS AUDIBLE ENOUGH TO ME
LISTEN DIANA SAID ONE OF THE ABSORBED STUDENTS FRANZ AND OLD DANIEL
ARE TOGETHER IN THE NIGHT TIME AND FRANZ IS TELLING A DREAM FROM WHICH
HE HAS AWAKENED IN TERROR LISTEN AND IN A LOW VOICE SHE READ
SOMETHING OF WHICH NOT ONE WORD WAS INTELLIGIBLE TO ME FOR IT WAS IN AN
UNKNOWN TONGUE NEITHER FRENCH NOR LATIN
WHETHER IT WERE GREEK OR
GERMAN I COULD NOT TELL
THAT IS STRONG SHE SAID WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED I RELISH IT THE
OTHER GIRL WHO HAD LIFTED HER HEAD TO LISTEN TO HER SISTER REPEATED
WHILE SHE GAZED AT THE FIRE A LINE OF WHAT HAD BEEN READ
AT A LATER
DAY I KNEW THE LANGUAGE AND THE BOOK THEREFORE I WILL HERE QUOTE THE
LINE THOUGH WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT IT WAS ONLY LIKE A STROKE ON
SOUNDING BRASS TO ME CONVEYING NO MEANING
'DA TRAT HERVOR EINER ANZUSEHEN WIE DIE STERNEN NACHT GOOD GOOD
SHE EXCLAIMED WHILE HER DARK AND DEEP EYE SPARKLED
THERE YOU HAVE A
DIM AND MIGHTY ARCHANGEL FITLY SET BEFORE YOU THE LINE IS WORTH A
HUNDRED PAGES OF FUSTIAN
'ICH WAGE DIE GEDANKEN IN DER SCHALE MEINES
ZORNES UND DIE WERKE MIT DEM GEWICHTE MEINES GRIMMS I LIKE IT
BOTH WERE AGAIN SILENT
IS THERE ONY COUNTRY WHERE THEY TALK I' THAT WAY ASKED THE OLD WOMAN
LOOKING UP FROM HER KNITTING
YES HANNAH A FAR LARGER COUNTRY THAN ENGLAND WHERE THEY TALK IN NO
OTHER WAY
WELL FOR SURE CASE I KNAWN'T HOW THEY CAN UNDERSTAND T' ONE T'OTHER
AND IF EITHER O' YE WENT THERE YE COULD TELL WHAT THEY SAID I GUESS
WE COULD PROBABLY TELL SOMETHING OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT NOT ALL FOR WE
ARE NOT AS CLEVER AS YOU THINK US HANNAH
WE DON'T SPEAK GERMAN AND WE
CANNOT READ IT WITHOUT A DICTIONARY TO HELP US
AND WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO YOU
WE MEAN TO TEACH IT SOME TIME OR AT LEAST THE ELEMENTS AS THEY SAY
AND THEN WE SHALL GET MORE MONEY THAN WE DO NOW
VARRY LIKE BUT GIVE OWER STUDYING YE'VE DONE ENOUGH FOR TO NIGHT
I THINK WE HAVE AT LEAST I'M TIRED
MARY ARE YOU
MORTALLY AFTER ALL IT'S TOUGH WORK FAGGING AWAY AT A LANGUAGE WITH NO
MASTER BUT A LEXICON
IT IS ESPECIALLY SUCH A LANGUAGE AS THIS CRABBED BUT GLORIOUS DEUTSCH
I WONDER WHEN ST
JOHN WILL COME HOME
SURELY HE WILL NOT BE LONG NOW IT IS JUST TEN LOOKING AT A LITTLE GOLD
WATCH SHE DREW FROM HER GIRDLE
IT RAINS FAST HANNAH WILL YOU HAVE
THE GOODNESS TO LOOK AT THE FIRE IN THE PARLOUR
THE WOMAN ROSE SHE OPENED A DOOR THROUGH WHICH I DIMLY SAW A PASSAGE
SOON I HEARD HER STIR A FIRE IN AN INNER ROOM SHE PRESENTLY CAME BACK
AH CHILDER SAID SHE IT FAIR TROUBLES ME TO GO INTO YOND' ROOM NOW
IT LOOKS SO LONESOME WI' THE CHAIR EMPTY AND SET BACK IN A CORNER
SHE WIPED HER EYES WITH HER APRON THE TWO GIRLS GRAVE BEFORE LOOKED
SAD NOW
BUT HE IS IN A BETTER PLACE CONTINUED HANNAH WE SHOULDN'T WISH HIM
HERE AGAIN
AND THEN NOBODY NEED TO HAVE A QUIETER DEATH NOR HE HAD
YOU SAY HE NEVER MENTIONED US INQUIRED ONE OF THE LADIES
HE HADN'T TIME BAIRN HE WAS GONE IN A MINUTE WAS YOUR FATHER
HE HAD
BEEN A BIT AILING LIKE THE DAY BEFORE BUT NAUGHT TO SIGNIFY AND WHEN
MR
ST
JOHN ASKED IF HE WOULD LIKE EITHER O' YE TO BE SENT FOR HE FAIR
LAUGHED AT HIM
HE BEGAN AGAIN WITH A BIT OF A HEAVINESS IN HIS HEAD THE
NEXT DAY THAT IS A FORTNIGHT SIN' AND HE WENT TO SLEEP AND NIVER
WAKENED HE WOR A'MOST STARK WHEN YOUR BROTHER WENT INTO T' CHAMBER AND
FAND HIM
AH CHILDER THAT'S T' LAST O' T' OLD STOCK FOR YE AND MR
ST
JOHN IS LIKE OF DIFFERENT SOART TO THEM 'AT'S GONE FOR ALL YOUR
MOTHER WOR MICH I' YOUR WAY AND A'MOST AS BOOK LEARNED
SHE WOR THE
PICTUR' O' YE MARY DIANA IS MORE LIKE YOUR FATHER
I THOUGHT THEM SO SIMILAR I COULD NOT TELL WHERE THE OLD SERVANT FOR
SUCH I NOW CONCLUDED HER TO BE SAW THE DIFFERENCE
BOTH WERE FAIR
COMPLEXIONED AND SLENDERLY MADE BOTH POSSESSED FACES FULL OF DISTINCTION
AND INTELLIGENCE
ONE TO BE SURE HAD HAIR A SHADE DARKER THAN THE
OTHER AND THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR STYLE OF WEARING IT MARY'S
PALE BROWN LOCKS WERE PARTED AND BRAIDED SMOOTH DIANA'S DUSKIER TRESSES
COVERED HER NECK WITH THICK CURLS
THE CLOCK STRUCK TEN
YE'LL WANT YOUR SUPPER I AM SURE OBSERVED HANNAH AND SO WILL MR
ST
JOHN WHEN HE COMES IN
AND SHE PROCEEDED TO PREPARE THE MEAL
THE LADIES ROSE THEY SEEMED
ABOUT TO WITHDRAW TO THE PARLOUR
TILL THIS MOMENT I HAD BEEN SO INTENT
ON WATCHING THEM THEIR APPEARANCE AND CONVERSATION HAD EXCITED IN ME SO
KEEN AN INTEREST I HAD HALF FORGOTTEN MY OWN WRETCHED POSITION NOW IT
RECURRED TO ME
MORE DESOLATE MORE DESPERATE THAN EVER IT SEEMED FROM
CONTRAST
AND HOW IMPOSSIBLE DID IT APPEAR TO TOUCH THE INMATES OF THIS
HOUSE WITH CONCERN ON MY BEHALF TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE IN THE TRUTH OF MY
WANTS AND WOES TO INDUCE THEM TO VOUCHSAFE A REST FOR MY WANDERINGS AS
I GROPED OUT THE DOOR AND KNOCKED AT IT HESITATINGLY I FELT THAT LAST
IDEA TO BE A MERE CHIMERA
HANNAH OPENED
WHAT DO YOU WANT SHE INQUIRED IN A VOICE OF SURPRISE AS SHE SURVEYED
ME BY THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE SHE HELD
MAY I SPEAK TO YOUR MISTRESSES I SAID
YOU HAD BETTER TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY TO THEM
WHERE DO YOU COME
FROM
I AM A STRANGER
WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS HERE AT THIS HOUR
I WANT A NIGHT'S SHELTER IN AN OUT HOUSE OR ANYWHERE AND A MORSEL OF
BREAD TO EAT
DISTRUST THE VERY FEELING I DREADED APPEARED IN HANNAH'S FACE
I'LL
GIVE YOU A PIECE OF BREAD SHE SAID AFTER A PAUSE BUT WE CAN'T TAKE
IN A VAGRANT TO LODGE
IT ISN'T LIKELY
DO LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MISTRESSES
NO NOT I
WHAT CAN THEY DO FOR YOU YOU SHOULD NOT BE ROVING ABOUT
NOW IT LOOKS VERY ILL
BUT WHERE SHALL I GO IF YOU DRIVE ME AWAY WHAT SHALL I DO
OH I'LL WARRANT YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO AND WHAT TO DO
MIND YOU DON'T DO
WRONG THAT'S ALL
HERE IS A PENNY NOW GO
A PENNY CANNOT FEED ME AND I HAVE NO STRENGTH TO GO FARTHER
DON'T
SHUT THE DOOR OH DON'T FOR GOD'S SAKE
I MUST THE RAIN IS DRIVING IN
TELL THE YOUNG LADIES
LET ME SEE THEM
INDEED I WILL NOT
YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU OUGHT TO BE OR YOU WOULDN'T
MAKE SUCH A NOISE
MOVE OFF
BUT I MUST DIE IF I AM TURNED AWAY
NOT YOU
I'M FEAR'D YOU HAVE SOME ILL PLANS AGATE THAT BRING YOU ABOUT
FOLK'S HOUSES AT THIS TIME O' NIGHT
IF YOU'VE ANY
FOLLOWERS HOUSEBREAKERS OR SUCH LIKE ANYWHERE NEAR YOU MAY TELL THEM
WE ARE NOT BY OURSELVES IN THE HOUSE WE HAVE A GENTLEMAN AND DOGS AND
GUNS HERE THE HONEST BUT INFLEXIBLE SERVANT CLAPPED THE DOOR TO AND
BOLTED IT WITHIN
THIS WAS THE CLIMAX
A PANG OF EXQUISITE SUFFERING A THROE OF TRUE
DESPAIR RENT AND HEAVED MY HEART
WORN OUT INDEED I WAS NOT ANOTHER
STEP COULD I STIR
I SANK ON THE WET DOORSTEP I GROANED I WRUNG MY
HANDS I WEPT IN UTTER ANGUISH
OH THIS SPECTRE OF DEATH OH THIS
LAST HOUR APPROACHING IN SUCH HORROR ALAS THIS ISOLATION THIS
BANISHMENT FROM MY KIND NOT ONLY THE ANCHOR OF HOPE BUT THE FOOTING OF
FORTITUDE WAS GONE AT LEAST FOR A MOMENT BUT THE LAST I SOON
ENDEAVOURED TO REGAIN
I CAN BUT DIE I SAID AND I BELIEVE IN GOD
LET ME TRY TO WAIT HIS
WILL IN SILENCE
THESE WORDS I NOT ONLY THOUGHT BUT UTTERED AND THRUSTING BACK ALL MY
MISERY INTO MY HEART I MADE AN EFFORT TO COMPEL IT TO REMAIN THERE DUMB
AND STILL
ALL MEN MUST DIE SAID A VOICE QUITE CLOSE AT HAND BUT ALL ARE NOT
CONDEMNED TO MEET A LINGERING AND PREMATURE DOOM SUCH AS YOURS WOULD BE
IF YOU PERISHED HERE OF WANT
WHO OR WHAT SPEAKS I ASKED TERRIFIED AT THE UNEXPECTED SOUND AND
INCAPABLE NOW OF DERIVING FROM ANY OCCURRENCE A HOPE OF AID
A FORM WAS
NEAR WHAT FORM THE PITCH DARK NIGHT AND MY ENFEEBLED VISION PREVENTED
ME FROM DISTINGUISHING
WITH A LOUD LONG KNOCK THE NEW COMER APPEALED
TO THE DOOR
IS IT YOU MR
ST
JOHN CRIED HANNAH
YES YES OPEN QUICKLY
WELL HOW WET AND COLD YOU MUST BE SUCH A WILD NIGHT AS IT IS COME

LEAST EXAMINE INTO IT
YOUNG WOMAN RISE AND PASS BEFORE ME INTO THE
HOUSE
HUSH HANNAH I HAVE A WORD TO SAY TO THE WOMAN P323 JPG
WITH DIFFICULTY I OBEYED HIM
PRESENTLY I STOOD WITHIN THAT CLEAN
BRIGHT KITCHEN ON THE VERY HEARTH TREMBLING SICKENING CONSCIOUS OF AN
ASPECT IN THE LAST DEGREE GHASTLY WILD AND WEATHER BEATEN
THE TWO
LADIES THEIR BROTHER MR
ST
JOHN THE OLD SERVANT WERE ALL GAZING AT
ME
ST
JOHN WHO IS IT I HEARD ONE ASK
I CANNOT TELL I FOUND HER AT THE DOOR WAS THE REPLY
SHE DOES LOOK WHITE SAID HANNAH
AS WHITE AS CLAY OR DEATH WAS RESPONDED
SHE WILL FALL LET HER
SIT
AND INDEED MY HEAD SWAM I DROPPED BUT A CHAIR RECEIVED ME
I STILL
POSSESSED MY SENSES THOUGH JUST NOW I COULD NOT SPEAK
PERHAPS A LITTLE WATER WOULD RESTORE HER
HANNAH FETCH SOME
BUT SHE
IS WORN TO NOTHING
HOW VERY THIN AND HOW VERY BLOODLESS
A MERE SPECTRE
IS SHE ILL OR ONLY FAMISHED
FAMISHED I THINK
HANNAH IS THAT MILK GIVE IT ME AND A PIECE OF
BREAD
DIANA I KNEW HER BY THE LONG CURLS WHICH I SAW DROOPING BETWEEN ME AND
THE FIRE AS SHE BENT OVER ME BROKE SOME BREAD DIPPED IT IN MILK AND
PUT IT TO MY LIPS
HER FACE WAS NEAR MINE I SAW THERE WAS PITY IN IT
AND I FELT SYMPATHY IN HER HURRIED BREATHING
IN HER SIMPLE WORDS TOO
THE SAME BALM LIKE EMOTION SPOKE TRY TO EAT
YES TRY REPEATED MARY GENTLY AND MARY'S HAND REMOVED MY SODDEN
BONNET AND LIFTED MY HEAD
I TASTED WHAT THEY OFFERED ME FEEBLY AT
FIRST EAGERLY SOON
NOT TOO MUCH AT FIRST RESTRAIN HER SAID THE BROTHER SHE HAS HAD
ENOUGH AND HE WITHDREW THE CUP OF MILK AND THE PLATE OF BREAD
A LITTLE MORE ST
JOHN LOOK AT THE AVIDITY IN HER EYES
NO MORE AT PRESENT SISTER
TRY IF SHE CAN SPEAK NOW ASK HER HER
NAME
I FELT I COULD SPEAK AND I ANSWERED MY NAME IS JANE ELLIOTT ANXIOUS
AS EVER TO AVOID DISCOVERY I HAD BEFORE RESOLVED TO ASSUME AN ALIAS
AND WHERE DO YOU LIVE WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS
I WAS SILENT
CAN WE SEND FOR ANY ONE YOU KNOW
I SHOOK MY HEAD
WHAT ACCOUNT CAN YOU GIVE OF YOURSELF
SOMEHOW NOW THAT I HAD ONCE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF THIS HOUSE AND
ONCE WAS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH ITS OWNERS I FELT NO LONGER OUTCAST
VAGRANT AND DISOWNED BY THE WIDE WORLD
I DARED TO PUT OFF THE
MENDICANT TO RESUME MY NATURAL MANNER AND CHARACTER
I BEGAN ONCE MORE
TO KNOW MYSELF AND WHEN MR
ST
JOHN DEMANDED AN ACCOUNT WHICH AT
PRESENT I WAS FAR TOO WEAK TO RENDER I SAID AFTER A BRIEF PAUSE
SIR I CAN GIVE YOU NO DETAILS TO NIGHT
BUT WHAT THEN SAID HE DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO FOR YOU
NOTHING I REPLIED
MY STRENGTH SUFFICED FOR BUT SHORT ANSWERS
DIANA
TOOK THE WORD
DO YOU MEAN SHE ASKED THAT WE HAVE NOW GIVEN YOU WHAT AID YOU
REQUIRE AND THAT WE MAY DISMISS YOU TO THE MOOR AND THE RAINY NIGHT
I LOOKED AT HER
SHE HAD I THOUGHT A REMARKABLE COUNTENANCE INSTINCT
BOTH WITH POWER AND GOODNESS
I TOOK SUDDEN COURAGE
ANSWERING HER
COMPASSIONATE GAZE WITH A SMILE I SAID I WILL TRUST YOU
IF I WERE A
MASTERLESS AND STRAY DOG I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD NOT TURN ME FROM YOUR
HEARTH TO NIGHT AS IT IS I REALLY HAVE NO FEAR
DO WITH ME AND FOR ME
AS YOU LIKE BUT EXCUSE ME FROM MUCH DISCOURSE MY BREATH IS SHORT I
FEEL A SPASM WHEN I SPEAK ALL THREE SURVEYED ME AND ALL THREE WERE
SILENT
HANNAH SAID MR
ST
JOHN AT LAST LET HER SIT THERE AT PRESENT AND
ASK HER NO QUESTIONS IN TEN MINUTES MORE GIVE HER THE REMAINDER OF THAT
MILK AND BREAD
MARY AND DIANA LET US GO INTO THE PARLOUR AND TALK THE
MATTER OVER
THEY WITHDREW
VERY SOON ONE OF THE LADIES RETURNED I COULD NOT TELL
WHICH
A KIND OF PLEASANT STUPOR WAS STEALING OVER ME AS I SAT BY THE
GENIAL FIRE
IN AN UNDERTONE SHE GAVE SOME DIRECTIONS TO HANNAH
ERE
LONG WITH THE SERVANT'S AID I CONTRIVED TO MOUNT A STAIRCASE MY
DRIPPING CLOTHES WERE REMOVED SOON A WARM DRY BED RECEIVED ME
I
THANKED GOD EXPERIENCED AMIDST UNUTTERABLE EXHAUSTION A GLOW OF GRATEFUL
JOY AND SLEPT
CHAPTER XXIX
THE RECOLLECTION OF ABOUT THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS SUCCEEDING THIS IS VERY
DIM IN MY MIND
I CAN RECALL SOME SENSATIONS FELT IN THAT INTERVAL BUT
FEW THOUGHTS FRAMED AND NO ACTIONS PERFORMED
I KNEW I WAS IN A SMALL
ROOM AND IN A NARROW BED
TO THAT BED I SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN I LAY ON
IT MOTIONLESS AS A STONE AND TO HAVE TORN ME FROM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ALMOST TO KILL ME
I TOOK NO NOTE OF THE LAPSE OF TIME OF THE CHANGE
FROM MORNING TO NOON FROM NOON TO EVENING
I OBSERVED WHEN ANY ONE
ENTERED OR LEFT THE APARTMENT I COULD EVEN TELL WHO THEY WERE I COULD
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SAID WHEN THE SPEAKER STOOD NEAR TO ME BUT I COULD
NOT ANSWER TO OPEN MY LIPS OR MOVE MY LIMBS WAS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE
HANNAH THE SERVANT WAS MY MOST FREQUENT VISITOR
HER COMING DISTURBED
ME
I HAD A FEELING THAT SHE WISHED ME AWAY THAT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
ME OR MY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE WAS PREJUDICED AGAINST ME
DIANA AND
MARY APPEARED IN THE CHAMBER ONCE OR TWICE A DAY
THEY WOULD WHISPER
SENTENCES OF THIS SORT AT MY BEDSIDE
IT IS VERY WELL WE TOOK HER IN
YES SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN FOUND DEAD AT THE DOOR IN THE MORNING
HAD SHE BEEN LEFT OUT ALL NIGHT
I WONDER WHAT SHE HAS GONE THROUGH
STRANGE HARDSHIPS I IMAGINE POOR EMACIATED PALLID WANDERER
SHE IS NOT AN UNEDUCATED PERSON I SHOULD THINK BY HER MANNER OF
SPEAKING HER ACCENT WAS QUITE PURE AND THE CLOTHES SHE TOOK OFF THOUGH
SPLASHED AND WET WERE LITTLE WORN AND FINE
SHE HAS A PECULIAR FACE FLESHLESS AND HAGGARD AS IT IS I RATHER LIKE
IT AND WHEN IN GOOD HEALTH AND ANIMATED I CAN FANCY HER PHYSIOGNOMY
WOULD BE AGREEABLE
NEVER ONCE IN THEIR DIALOGUES DID I HEAR A SYLLABLE OF REGRET AT THE
HOSPITALITY THEY HAD EXTENDED TO ME OR OF SUSPICION OF OR AVERSION TO
MYSELF
I WAS COMFORTED
MR
ST
JOHN CAME BUT ONCE HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID MY STATE OF
LETHARGY WAS THE RESULT OF REACTION FROM EXCESSIVE AND PROTRACTED
FATIGUE
HE PRONOUNCED IT NEEDLESS TO SEND FOR A DOCTOR NATURE HE WAS
SURE WOULD MANAGE BEST LEFT TO HERSELF
HE SAID EVERY NERVE HAD BEEN
OVERSTRAINED IN SOME WAY AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM MUST SLEEP TORPID A WHILE
THERE WAS NO DISEASE
HE IMAGINED MY RECOVERY WOULD BE RAPID ENOUGH WHEN
ONCE COMMENCED
THESE OPINIONS HE DELIVERED IN A FEW WORDS IN A QUIET
LOW VOICE AND ADDED AFTER A PAUSE IN THE TONE OF A MAN LITTLE
ACCUSTOMED TO EXPANSIVE COMMENT RATHER AN UNUSUAL PHYSIOGNOMY
CERTAINLY NOT INDICATIVE OF VULGARITY OR DEGRADATION
FAR OTHERWISE RESPONDED DIANA
TO SPEAK TRUTH ST
JOHN MY HEART
RATHER WARMS TO THE POOR LITTLE SOUL
I WISH WE MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT
HER PERMANENTLY
THAT IS HARDLY LIKELY WAS THE REPLY
YOU WILL FIND SHE IS SOME YOUNG
LADY WHO HAS HAD A MISUNDERSTANDING WITH HER FRIENDS AND HAS PROBABLY
INJUDICIOUSLY LEFT THEM
WE MAY PERHAPS SUCCEED IN RESTORING HER TO
THEM IF SHE IS NOT OBSTINATE BUT I TRACE LINES OF FORCE IN HER FACE
WHICH MAKE ME SCEPTICAL OF HER TRACTABILITY HE STOOD CONSIDERING ME
SOME MINUTES THEN ADDED SHE LOOKS SENSIBLE BUT NOT AT ALL HANDSOME
SHE IS SO ILL ST
JOHN
ILL OR WELL SHE WOULD ALWAYS BE PLAIN
THE GRACE AND HARMONY OF BEAUTY
ARE QUITE WANTING IN THOSE FEATURES
ON THE THIRD DAY I WAS BETTER ON THE FOURTH I COULD SPEAK MOVE RISE
IN BED AND TURN
HANNAH HAD BROUGHT ME SOME GRUEL AND DRY TOAST ABOUT
AS I SUPPOSED THE DINNER HOUR
I HAD EATEN WITH RELISH THE FOOD WAS
GOOD VOID OF THE FEVERISH FLAVOUR WHICH HAD HITHERTO POISONED WHAT I HAD
SWALLOWED
WHEN SHE LEFT ME I FELT COMPARATIVELY STRONG AND REVIVED
ERE LONG SATIETY OF REPOSE AND DESIRE FOR ACTION STIRRED ME
I WISHED TO
RISE BUT WHAT COULD I PUT ON ONLY MY DAMP AND BEMIRED APPAREL IN
WHICH I HAD SLEPT ON THE GROUND AND FALLEN IN THE MARSH
I FELT ASHAMED
TO APPEAR BEFORE MY BENEFACTORS SO CLAD
I WAS SPARED THE HUMILIATION
ON A CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE WERE ALL MY OWN THINGS CLEAN AND DRY
MY
BLACK SILK FROCK HUNG AGAINST THE WALL
THE TRACES OF THE BOG WERE
REMOVED FROM IT THE CREASES LEFT BY THE WET SMOOTHED OUT IT WAS QUITE
DECENT
MY VERY SHOES AND STOCKINGS WERE PURIFIED AND RENDERED
PRESENTABLE
THERE WERE THE MEANS OF WASHING IN THE ROOM AND A COMB AND
BRUSH TO SMOOTH MY HAIR
AFTER A WEARY PROCESS AND RESTING EVERY FIVE
MINUTES I SUCCEEDED IN DRESSING MYSELF
MY CLOTHES HUNG LOOSE ON ME
FOR I WAS MUCH WASTED BUT I COVERED DEFICIENCIES WITH A SHAWL AND ONCE
MORE CLEAN AND RESPECTABLE LOOKING NO SPECK OF THE DIRT NO TRACE OF
THE DISORDER I SO HATED AND WHICH SEEMED SO TO DEGRADE ME LEFT I CREPT
DOWN A STONE STAIRCASE WITH THE AID OF THE BANISTERS TO A NARROW LOW
PASSAGE AND FOUND MY WAY PRESENTLY TO THE KITCHEN
IT WAS FULL OF THE FRAGRANCE OF NEW BREAD AND THE WARMTH OF A GENEROUS
FIRE
HANNAH WAS BAKING
PREJUDICES IT IS WELL KNOWN ARE MOST
DIFFICULT TO ERADICATE FROM THE HEART WHOSE SOIL HAS NEVER BEEN LOOSENED
OR FERTILISED BY EDUCATION THEY GROW THERE FIRM AS WEEDS AMONG STONES
HANNAH HAD BEEN COLD AND STIFF INDEED AT THE FIRST LATTERLY SHE HAD
BEGUN TO RELENT A LITTLE AND WHEN SHE SAW ME COME IN TIDY AND
WELL DRESSED SHE EVEN SMILED
WHAT YOU HAVE GOT UP SHE SAID
YOU ARE BETTER THEN
YOU MAY SIT
YOU DOWN IN MY CHAIR ON THE HEARTHSTONE IF YOU WILL
SHE POINTED TO THE ROCKING CHAIR I TOOK IT
SHE BUSTLED ABOUT
EXAMINING ME EVERY NOW AND THEN WITH THE CORNER OF HER EYE
TURNING TO
ME AS SHE TOOK SOME LOAVES FROM THE OVEN SHE ASKED BLUNTLY
DID YOU EVER GO A BEGGING AFORE YOU CAME HERE
I WAS INDIGNANT FOR A MOMENT BUT REMEMBERING THAT ANGER WAS OUT OF THE
QUESTION AND THAT I HAD INDEED APPEARED AS A BEGGAR TO HER I ANSWERED
QUIETLY BUT STILL NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN MARKED FIRMNESS
YOU ARE MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING ME A BEGGAR
I AM NO BEGGAR ANY MORE
THAN YOURSELF OR YOUR YOUNG LADIES
AFTER A PAUSE SHE SAID I DUNNUT UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'VE LIKE NO HOUSE
NOR NO BRASS I GUESS
THE WANT OF HOUSE OR BRASS BY WHICH I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN MONEY DOES NOT
MAKE A BEGGAR IN YOUR SENSE OF THE WORD
ARE YOU BOOK LEARNED SHE INQUIRED PRESENTLY
YES VERY
BUT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A BOARDING SCHOOL
I WAS AT A BOARDING SCHOOL EIGHT YEARS
SHE OPENED HER EYES WIDE
WHATEVER CANNOT YE KEEP YOURSELF FOR THEN
I HAVE KEPT MYSELF AND I TRUST SHALL KEEP MYSELF AGAIN
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO WITH THESE GOOSEBERRIES I INQUIRED AS SHE BROUGHT OUT A
BASKET OF THE FRUIT
MAK' 'EM INTO PIES
GIVE THEM TO ME AND I'LL PICK THEM
NAY I DUNNUT WANT YE TO DO NOUGHT
BUT I MUST DO SOMETHING
LET ME HAVE THEM
SHE CONSENTED AND SHE EVEN BROUGHT ME A CLEAN TOWEL TO SPREAD OVER MY
DRESS LEST AS SHE SAID I SHOULD MUCKY IT
YE'VE NOT BEEN USED TO SARVANT'S WARK I SEE BY YOUR HANDS SHE
REMARKED
HAPPEN YE'VE BEEN A DRESSMAKER
NO YOU ARE WRONG
AND NOW NEVER MIND WHAT I HAVE BEEN DON'T TROUBLE
YOUR HEAD FURTHER ABOUT ME BUT TELL ME THE NAME OF THE HOUSE WHERE WE
ARE
SOME CALLS IT MARSH END AND SOME CALLS IT MOOR HOUSE
AND THE GENTLEMAN WHO LIVES HERE IS CALLED MR
ST
JOHN
NAY HE DOESN'T LIVE HERE HE IS ONLY STAYING A WHILE
WHEN HE IS AT
HOME HE IS IN HIS OWN PARISH AT MORTON
THAT VILLAGE A FEW MILES OFF
AYE
AND WHAT IS HE
HE IS A PARSON
I REMEMBERED THE ANSWER OF THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER AT THE PARSONAGE WHEN I
HAD ASKED TO SEE THE CLERGYMAN
THIS THEN WAS HIS FATHER'S
RESIDENCE
AYE OLD MR
RIVERS LIVED HERE AND HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER AND
GURT GREAT GRANDFATHER AFORE HIM
THE NAME THEN OF THAT GENTLEMAN IS MR
ST
JOHN RIVERS
AYE ST
JOHN IS LIKE HIS KIRSTENED NAME
AND HIS SISTERS ARE CALLED DIANA AND MARY RIVERS
YES
THEIR FATHER IS DEAD
DEAD THREE WEEKS SIN' OF A STROKE
THEY HAVE NO MOTHER
THE MISTRESS HAS BEEN DEAD THIS MONY A YEAR
HAVE YOU LIVED WITH THE FAMILY LONG
I'VE LIVED HERE THIRTY YEAR
I NURSED THEM ALL THREE
THAT PROVES YOU MUST HAVE BEEN AN HONEST AND FAITHFUL SERVANT
I WILL
SAY SO MUCH FOR YOU THOUGH YOU HAVE HAD THE INCIVILITY TO CALL ME A
BEGGAR
SHE AGAIN REGARDED ME WITH A SURPRISED STARE
I BELIEVE SHE SAID I
WAS QUITE MISTA'EN IN MY THOUGHTS OF YOU BUT THERE IS SO MONY CHEATS
GOES ABOUT YOU MUN FORGIE ME
AND THOUGH I CONTINUED RATHER SEVERELY YOU WISHED TO TURN ME FROM
THE DOOR ON A NIGHT WHEN YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SHUT OUT A DOG
WELL IT WAS HARD BUT WHAT CAN A BODY DO I THOUGHT MORE O' TH'
CHILDER NOR OF MYSEL POOR THINGS THEY'VE LIKE NOBODY TO TAK' CARE ON
'EM BUT ME
I'M LIKE TO LOOK SHARPISH
I MAINTAINED A GRAVE SILENCE FOR SOME MINUTES
YOU MUNNUT THINK TOO HARDLY OF ME SHE AGAIN REMARKED
BUT I DO THINK HARDLY OF YOU I SAID AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY NOT SO
MUCH BECAUSE YOU REFUSED TO GIVE ME SHELTER OR REGARDED ME AS AN
IMPOSTOR AS BECAUSE YOU JUST NOW MADE IT A SPECIES OF REPROACH THAT I
HAD NO 'BRASS' AND NO HOUSE
SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE THAT EVER LIVED
HAVE BEEN AS DESTITUTE AS I AM AND IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN YOU OUGHT NOT
TO CONSIDER POVERTY A CRIME
NO MORE I OUGHT SAID SHE MR
ST
JOHN TELLS ME SO TOO AND I SEE I
WOR WRANG BUT I'VE CLEAR A DIFFERENT NOTION ON YOU NOW TO WHAT I HAD
YOU LOOK A RAIGHT DOWN DACENT LITTLE CRATER
THAT WILL DO I FORGIVE YOU NOW
SHAKE HANDS
SHE PUT HER FLOURY AND HORNY HAND INTO MINE ANOTHER AND HEARTIER SMILE
ILLUMINED HER ROUGH FACE AND FROM THAT MOMENT WE WERE FRIENDS
HANNAH WAS EVIDENTLY FOND OF TALKING
WHILE I PICKED THE FRUIT AND SHE
MADE THE PASTE FOR THE PIES SHE PROCEEDED TO GIVE ME SUNDRY DETAILS
ABOUT HER DECEASED MASTER AND MISTRESS AND THE CHILDER AS SHE CALLED
THE YOUNG PEOPLE
OLD MR
RIVERS SHE SAID WAS A PLAIN MAN ENOUGH BUT A GENTLEMAN AND OF
AS ANCIENT A FAMILY AS COULD BE FOUND
MARSH END HAD BELONGED TO THE
RIVERS EVER SINCE IT WAS A HOUSE AND IT WAS SHE AFFIRMED ABOON TWO
HUNDRED YEAR OLD FOR ALL IT LOOKED BUT A SMALL HUMBLE PLACE NAUGHT TO
COMPARE WI' MR
OLIVER'S GRAND HALL DOWN I' MORTON VALE
BUT SHE COULD
REMEMBER BILL OLIVER'S FATHER A JOURNEYMAN NEEDLEMAKER AND TH' RIVERS
WOR GENTRY I' TH' OWD DAYS O' TH' HENRYS AS ONYBODY MIGHT SEE BY LOOKING
INTO TH' REGISTERS I' MORTON CHURCH VESTRY STILL SHE ALLOWED THE
OWD MAISTER WAS LIKE OTHER FOLK NAUGHT MICH OUT O' T' COMMON WAY STARK
MAD O' SHOOTING AND FARMING AND SICH LIKE THE MISTRESS WAS
DIFFERENT
SHE WAS A GREAT READER AND STUDIED A DEAL AND THE BAIRNS
HAD TAKEN AFTER HER
THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE THEM IN THESE PARTS NOR
EVER HAD BEEN THEY HAD LIKED LEARNING ALL THREE ALMOST FROM THE TIME
THEY COULD SPEAK AND THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN OF A MAK' OF THEIR OWN MR
ST
JOHN WHEN HE GREW UP WOULD GO TO COLLEGE AND BE A PARSON AND THE
GIRLS AS SOON AS THEY LEFT SCHOOL WOULD SEEK PLACES AS GOVERNESSES FOR
THEY HAD TOLD HER THEIR FATHER HAD SOME YEARS AGO LOST A GREAT DEAL OF
MONEY BY A MAN HE HAD TRUSTED TURNING BANKRUPT AND AS HE WAS NOW NOT
RICH ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM FORTUNES THEY MUST PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES
THEY
HAD LIVED VERY LITTLE AT HOME FOR A LONG WHILE AND WERE ONLY COME NOW TO
STAY A FEW WEEKS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR FATHER'S DEATH BUT THEY DID SO LIKE
MARSH END AND MORTON AND ALL THESE MOORS AND HILLS ABOUT
THEY HAD BEEN
IN LONDON AND MANY OTHER GRAND TOWNS BUT THEY ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS NO
PLACE LIKE HOME AND THEN THEY WERE SO AGREEABLE WITH EACH OTHER NEVER
FELL OUT NOR THREAPED SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE THERE WAS SUCH A FAMILY
FOR BEING UNITED
HAVING FINISHED MY TASK OF GOOSEBERRY PICKING I ASKED WHERE THE TWO
LADIES AND THEIR BROTHER WERE NOW
GONE OVER TO MORTON FOR A WALK BUT THEY WOULD BE BACK IN HALF AN HOUR
TO TEA
THEY RETURNED WITHIN THE TIME HANNAH HAD ALLOTTED THEM THEY ENTERED BY
THE KITCHEN DOOR
MR
ST
JOHN WHEN HE SAW ME MERELY BOWED AND PASSED
THROUGH THE TWO LADIES STOPPED MARY IN A FEW WORDS KINDLY AND CALMLY
EXPRESSED THE PLEASURE SHE FELT IN SEEING ME WELL ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO
COME DOWN DIANA TOOK MY HAND SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AT ME
YOU SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR MY LEAVE TO DESCEND SHE SAID
YOU STILL
LOOK VERY PALE AND SO THIN POOR CHILD POOR GIRL
DIANA HAD A VOICE TONED TO MY EAR LIKE THE COOING OF A DOVE
SHE
POSSESSED EYES WHOSE GAZE I DELIGHTED TO ENCOUNTER
HER WHOLE FACE
SEEMED TO ME FULL OF CHARM
MARY'S COUNTENANCE WAS EQUALLY
INTELLIGENT HER FEATURES EQUALLY PRETTY BUT HER EXPRESSION WAS MORE
RESERVED AND HER MANNERS THOUGH GENTLE MORE DISTANT
DIANA LOOKED AND
SPOKE WITH A CERTAIN AUTHORITY SHE HAD A WILL EVIDENTLY
IT WAS MY
NATURE TO FEEL PLEASURE IN YIELDING TO AN AUTHORITY SUPPORTED LIKE HERS
AND TO BEND WHERE MY CONSCIENCE AND SELF RESPECT PERMITTED TO AN ACTIVE
WILL
AND WHAT BUSINESS HAVE YOU HERE SHE CONTINUED
IT IS NOT YOUR PLACE
MARY AND I SIT IN THE KITCHEN SOMETIMES BECAUSE AT HOME WE LIKE TO BE
FREE EVEN TO LICENSE BUT YOU ARE A VISITOR AND MUST GO INTO THE
PARLOUR
I AM VERY WELL HERE
NOT AT ALL WITH HANNAH BUSTLING ABOUT AND COVERING YOU WITH FLOUR
BESIDES THE FIRE IS TOO HOT FOR YOU INTERPOSED MARY
TO BE SURE ADDED HER SISTER
COME YOU MUST BE OBEDIENT AND STILL
HOLDING MY HAND SHE MADE ME RISE AND LED ME INTO THE INNER ROOM
SIT THERE SHE SAID PLACING ME ON THE SOFA WHILE WE TAKE OUR THINGS
OFF AND GET THE TEA READY IT IS ANOTHER PRIVILEGE WE EXERCISE IN OUR
LITTLE MOORLAND HOME TO PREPARE OUR OWN MEALS WHEN WE ARE SO INCLINED
OR WHEN HANNAH IS BAKING BREWING WASHING OR IRONING
SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LEAVING ME SOLUS WITH MR
ST
JOHN WHO SAT
OPPOSITE A BOOK OR NEWSPAPER IN HIS HAND
I EXAMINED FIRST THE
PARLOUR AND THEN ITS OCCUPANT
THE PARLOUR WAS RATHER A SMALL ROOM VERY PLAINLY FURNISHED YET
COMFORTABLE BECAUSE CLEAN AND NEAT
THE OLD FASHIONED CHAIRS WERE VERY
BRIGHT AND THE WALNUT WOOD TABLE WAS LIKE A LOOKING GLASS
A FEW
STRANGE ANTIQUE PORTRAITS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OTHER DAYS DECORATED
THE STAINED WALLS A CUPBOARD WITH GLASS DOORS CONTAINED SOME BOOKS AND
AN ANCIENT SET OF CHINA
THERE WAS NO SUPERFLUOUS ORNAMENT IN THE
ROOM NOT ONE MODERN PIECE OF FURNITURE SAVE A BRACE OF WORKBOXES AND A
LADY'S DESK IN ROSEWOOD WHICH STOOD ON A SIDE TABLE
EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE CARPET AND CURTAINS LOOKED AT ONCE WELL WORN
AND WELL SAVED
MR
ST
JOHN SITTING AS STILL AS ONE OF THE DUSTY PICTURES ON THE WALLS
KEEPING HIS EYES FIXED ON THE PAGE HE PERUSED AND HIS LIPS MUTELY
SEALED WAS EASY ENOUGH TO EXAMINE
HAD HE BEEN A STATUE INSTEAD OF A
MAN HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN EASIER
HE WAS YOUNG PERHAPS FROM TWENTY
EIGHT TO THIRTY TALL SLENDER HIS FACE RIVETED THE EYE IT WAS LIKE A
GREEK FACE VERY PURE IN OUTLINE QUITE A STRAIGHT CLASSIC NOSE QUITE
AN ATHENIAN MOUTH AND CHIN
IT IS SELDOM INDEED AN ENGLISH FACE COMES
SO NEAR THE ANTIQUE MODELS AS DID HIS
HE MIGHT WELL BE A LITTLE SHOCKED
AT THE IRREGULARITY OF MY LINEAMENTS HIS OWN BEING SO HARMONIOUS
HIS
EYES WERE LARGE AND BLUE WITH BROWN LASHES HIS HIGH FOREHEAD
COLOURLESS AS IVORY WAS PARTIALLY STREAKED OVER BY CARELESS LOCKS OF
FAIR HAIR
THIS IS A GENTLE DELINEATION IS IT NOT READER YET HE WHOM IT
DESCRIBES SCARCELY IMPRESSED ONE WITH THE IDEA OF A GENTLE A YIELDING
AN IMPRESSIBLE OR EVEN OF A PLACID NATURE
QUIESCENT AS HE NOW SAT
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIS NOSTRIL HIS MOUTH HIS BROW WHICH TO MY
PERCEPTIONS INDICATED ELEMENTS WITHIN EITHER RESTLESS OR HARD OR
EAGER
HE DID NOT SPEAK TO ME ONE WORD NOR EVEN DIRECT TO ME ONE
GLANCE TILL HIS SISTERS RETURNED
DIANA AS SHE PASSED IN AND OUT IN
THE COURSE OF PREPARING TEA BROUGHT ME A LITTLE CAKE BAKED ON THE TOP
OF THE OVEN
EAT THAT NOW SHE SAID YOU MUST BE HUNGRY
HANNAH SAYS YOU HAVE HAD
NOTHING BUT SOME GRUEL SINCE BREAKFAST
I DID NOT REFUSE IT FOR MY APPETITE WAS AWAKENED AND KEEN
MR
RIVERS
NOW CLOSED HIS BOOK APPROACHED THE TABLE AND AS HE TOOK A SEAT FIXED
HIS BLUE PICTORIAL LOOKING EYES FULL ON ME
THERE WAS AN UNCEREMONIOUS
DIRECTNESS A SEARCHING DECIDED STEADFASTNESS IN HIS GAZE NOW WHICH
TOLD THAT INTENTION AND NOT DIFFIDENCE HAD HITHERTO KEPT IT AVERTED
FROM THE STRANGER
YOU ARE VERY HUNGRY HE SAID
I AM SIR IT IS MY WAY IT ALWAYS WAS MY WAY BY INSTINCT EVER TO
MEET THE BRIEF WITH BREVITY THE DIRECT WITH PLAINNESS
IT IS WELL FOR YOU THAT A LOW FEVER HAS FORCED YOU TO ABSTAIN FOR THE
LAST THREE DAYS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN DANGER IN YIELDING TO THE CRAVINGS
OF YOUR APPETITE AT FIRST
NOW YOU MAY EAT THOUGH STILL NOT
IMMODERATELY
I TRUST I SHALL NOT EAT LONG AT YOUR EXPENSE SIR WAS MY VERY CLUMSILY
CONTRIVED UNPOLISHED ANSWER
NO HE SAID COOLLY WHEN YOU HAVE INDICATED TO US THE RESIDENCE OF
YOUR FRIENDS WE CAN WRITE TO THEM AND YOU MAY BE RESTORED TO HOME
THAT I MUST PLAINLY TELL YOU IS OUT OF MY POWER TO DO BEING
ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT HOME AND FRIENDS
THE THREE LOOKED AT ME BUT NOT DISTRUSTFULLY I FELT THERE WAS NO
SUSPICION IN THEIR GLANCES THERE WAS MORE OF CURIOSITY
I SPEAK
PARTICULARLY OF THE YOUNG LADIES
ST
JOHN'S EYES THOUGH CLEAR ENOUGH
IN A LITERAL SENSE IN A FIGURATIVE ONE WERE DIFFICULT TO FATHOM
HE
SEEMED TO USE THEM RATHER AS INSTRUMENTS TO SEARCH OTHER PEOPLE'S
THOUGHTS THAN AS AGENTS TO REVEAL HIS OWN THE WHICH COMBINATION OF
KEENNESS AND RESERVE WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE CALCULATED TO EMBARRASS THAN
TO ENCOURAGE
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE ASKED THAT YOU ARE COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM
EVERY CONNECTION
I DO
NOT A TIE LINKS ME TO ANY LIVING THING NOT A CLAIM DO I POSSESS
TO ADMITTANCE UNDER ANY ROOF IN ENGLAND
A MOST SINGULAR POSITION AT YOUR AGE
HERE I SAW HIS GLANCE DIRECTED TO MY HANDS WHICH WERE FOLDED ON THE
TABLE BEFORE ME
I WONDERED WHAT HE SOUGHT THERE HIS WORDS SOON
EXPLAINED THE QUEST
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN MARRIED YOU ARE A SPINSTER
DIANA LAUGHED
WHY SHE CAN'T BE ABOVE SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
ST
JOHN SAID SHE
I AM NEAR NINETEEN BUT I AM NOT MARRIED
NO
I FELT A BURNING GLOW MOUNT TO MY FACE FOR BITTER AND AGITATING
RECOLLECTIONS WERE AWAKENED BY THE ALLUSION TO MARRIAGE
THEY ALL SAW
THE EMBARRASSMENT AND THE EMOTION
DIANA AND MARY RELIEVED ME BY TURNING
THEIR EYES ELSEWHERE THAN TO MY CRIMSONED VISAGE BUT THE COLDER AND
STERNER BROTHER CONTINUED TO GAZE TILL THE TROUBLE HE HAD EXCITED FORCED
OUT TEARS AS WELL AS COLOUR
WHERE DID YOU LAST RESIDE HE NOW ASKED
YOU ARE TOO INQUISITIVE ST
JOHN MURMURED MARY IN A LOW VOICE BUT HE
LEANED OVER THE TABLE AND REQUIRED AN ANSWER BY A SECOND FIRM AND
PIERCING LOOK
THE NAME OF THE PLACE WHERE AND OF THE PERSON WITH WHOM I LIVED IS MY
SECRET I REPLIED CONCISELY
WHICH IF YOU LIKE YOU HAVE IN MY OPINION A RIGHT TO KEEP BOTH FROM
ST
JOHN AND EVERY OTHER QUESTIONER REMARKED DIANA
YET IF I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU OR YOUR HISTORY I CANNOT HELP YOU HE
SAID
AND YOU NEED HELP DO YOU NOT
I NEED IT AND I SEEK IT SO FAR SIR THAT SOME TRUE PHILANTHROPIST WILL
PUT ME IN THE WAY OF GETTING WORK WHICH I CAN DO AND THE REMUNERATION
FOR WHICH WILL KEEP ME IF BUT IN THE BAREST NECESSARIES OF LIFE
I KNOW NOT WHETHER I AM A TRUE PHILANTHROPIST YET I AM WILLING TO AID
YOU TO THE UTMOST OF MY POWER IN A PURPOSE SO HONEST
FIRST THEN TELL
ME WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DO AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
I HAD NOW SWALLOWED MY TEA
I WAS MIGHTILY REFRESHED BY THE BEVERAGE AS
MUCH SO AS A GIANT WITH WINE IT GAVE NEW TONE TO MY UNSTRUNG NERVES AND
ENABLED ME TO ADDRESS THIS PENETRATING YOUNG JUDGE STEADILY
MR
RIVERS I SAID TURNING TO HIM AND LOOKING AT HIM AS HE LOOKED AT
ME OPENLY AND WITHOUT DIFFIDENCE YOU AND YOUR SISTERS HAVE DONE ME A
GREAT SERVICE THE GREATEST MAN CAN DO HIS FELLOW BEING YOU HAVE RESCUED
ME BY YOUR NOBLE HOSPITALITY FROM DEATH
THIS BENEFIT CONFERRED GIVES
YOU AN UNLIMITED CLAIM ON MY GRATITUDE AND A CLAIM TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
ON MY CONFIDENCE
I WILL TELL YOU AS MUCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE WANDERER
YOU HAVE HARBOURED AS I CAN TELL WITHOUT COMPROMISING MY OWN PEACE OF
MIND MY OWN SECURITY MORAL AND PHYSICAL AND THAT OF OTHERS
I AM AN ORPHAN THE DAUGHTER OF A CLERGYMAN
MY PARENTS DIED BEFORE I
COULD KNOW THEM
I WAS BROUGHT UP A DEPENDANT EDUCATED IN A CHARITABLE
INSTITUTION
I WILL EVEN TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE ESTABLISHMENT WHERE I
PASSED SIX YEARS AS A PUPIL AND TWO AS A TEACHER LOWOOD ORPHAN ASYLUM
SHIRE YOU WILL HAVE HEARD OF IT MR
RIVERS THE REV
ROBERT
BROCKLEHURST IS THE TREASURER
I HAVE HEARD OF MR
BROCKLEHURST AND I HAVE SEEN THE SCHOOL
I LEFT LOWOOD NEARLY A YEAR SINCE TO BECOME A PRIVATE GOVERNESS
I
OBTAINED A GOOD SITUATION AND WAS HAPPY
THIS PLACE I WAS OBLIGED TO
LEAVE FOUR DAYS BEFORE I CAME HERE
THE REASON OF MY DEPARTURE I CANNOT
AND OUGHT NOT TO EXPLAIN IT WOULD BE USELESS DANGEROUS AND WOULD SOUND
INCREDIBLE
NO BLAME ATTACHED TO ME I AM AS FREE FROM CULPABILITY AS
ANY ONE OF YOU THREE
MISERABLE I AM AND MUST BE FOR A TIME FOR THE
CATASTROPHE WHICH DROVE ME FROM A HOUSE I HAD FOUND A PARADISE WAS OF A
STRANGE AND DIREFUL NATURE
I OBSERVED BUT TWO POINTS IN PLANNING MY
DEPARTURE SPEED SECRECY TO SECURE THESE I HAD TO LEAVE BEHIND ME
EVERYTHING I POSSESSED EXCEPT A SMALL PARCEL WHICH IN MY HURRY AND
TROUBLE OF MIND I FORGOT TO TAKE OUT OF THE COACH THAT BROUGHT ME TO
WHITCROSS
TO THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THEN I CAME QUITE DESTITUTE
I
SLEPT TWO NIGHTS IN THE OPEN AIR AND WANDERED ABOUT TWO DAYS WITHOUT
CROSSING A THRESHOLD BUT TWICE IN THAT SPACE OF TIME DID I TASTE FOOD
AND IT WAS WHEN BROUGHT BY HUNGER EXHAUSTION AND DESPAIR ALMOST TO THE
LAST GASP THAT YOU MR
RIVERS FORBADE ME TO PERISH OF WANT AT YOUR
DOOR AND TOOK ME UNDER THE SHELTER OF YOUR ROOF
I KNOW ALL YOUR
SISTERS HAVE DONE FOR ME SINCE FOR I HAVE NOT BEEN INSENSIBLE DURING MY
SEEMING TORPOR AND I OWE TO THEIR SPONTANEOUS GENUINE GENIAL
COMPASSION AS LARGE A DEBT AS TO YOUR EVANGELICAL CHARITY
DON'T MAKE HER TALK ANY MORE NOW ST
JOHN SAID DIANA AS I PAUSED
SHE IS EVIDENTLY NOT YET FIT FOR EXCITEMENT
COME TO THE SOFA AND SIT
DOWN NOW MISS ELLIOTT
I GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY HALF START AT HEARING THE ALIAS I HAD FORGOTTEN
MY NEW NAME
MR
RIVERS WHOM NOTHING SEEMED TO ESCAPE NOTICED IT AT
ONCE
YOU SAID YOUR NAME WAS JANE ELLIOTT HE OBSERVED
I DID SAY SO AND IT IS THE NAME BY WHICH I THINK IT EXPEDIENT TO BE
CALLED AT PRESENT BUT IT IS NOT MY REAL NAME AND WHEN I HEAR IT IT
SOUNDS STRANGE TO ME
YOUR REAL NAME YOU WILL NOT GIVE
NO I FEAR DISCOVERY ABOVE ALL THINGS AND WHATEVER DISCLOSURE WOULD
LEAD TO IT I AVOID
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT I AM SURE SAID DIANA
NOW DO BROTHER LET HER
BE AT PEACE A WHILE
BUT WHEN ST
JOHN HAD MUSED A FEW MOMENTS HE RECOMMENCED AS IMPERTURBABLY
AND WITH AS MUCH ACUMEN AS EVER
YOU WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE LONG DEPENDENT ON OUR HOSPITALITY YOU WOULD
WISH I SEE TO DISPENSE AS SOON AS MAY BE WITH MY SISTERS' COMPASSION
AND ABOVE ALL WITH MY CHARITY I AM QUITE SENSIBLE OF THE DISTINCTION
DRAWN NOR DO I RESENT IT IT IS JUST YOU DESIRE TO BE INDEPENDENT OF
US
I DO I HAVE ALREADY SAID SO
SHOW ME HOW TO WORK OR HOW TO SEEK WORK
THAT IS ALL I NOW ASK THEN LET ME GO IF IT BE BUT TO THE MEANEST
COTTAGE BUT TILL THEN ALLOW ME TO STAY HERE I DREAD ANOTHER ESSAY OF
THE HORRORS OF HOMELESS DESTITUTION
INDEED YOU SHALL STAY HERE SAID DIANA PUTTING HER WHITE HAND ON MY
HEAD
YOU SHALL REPEATED MARY IN THE TONE OF UNDEMONSTRATIVE
SINCERITY WHICH SEEMED NATURAL TO HER
MY SISTERS YOU SEE HAVE A PLEASURE IN KEEPING YOU SAID MR
ST
JOHN
AS THEY WOULD HAVE A PLEASURE IN KEEPING AND CHERISHING A HALF FROZEN
BIRD SOME WINTRY WIND MIGHT HAVE DRIVEN THROUGH THEIR CASEMENT
I FEEL
MORE INCLINATION TO PUT YOU IN THE WAY OF KEEPING YOURSELF AND SHALL
ENDEAVOUR TO DO SO BUT OBSERVE MY SPHERE IS NARROW
I AM BUT THE
INCUMBENT OF A POOR COUNTRY PARISH MY AID MUST BE OF THE HUMBLEST SORT
AND IF YOU ARE INCLINED TO DESPISE THE DAY OF SMALL THINGS SEEK SOME
MORE EFFICIENT SUCCOUR THAN SUCH AS I CAN OFFER
SHE HAS ALREADY SAID THAT SHE IS WILLING TO DO ANYTHING HONEST SHE CAN
DO ANSWERED DIANA FOR ME AND YOU KNOW ST
JOHN SHE HAS NO CHOICE OF
HELPERS SHE IS FORCED TO PUT UP WITH SUCH CRUSTY PEOPLE AS YOU
I WILL BE A DRESSMAKER I WILL BE A PLAIN WORKWOMAN I WILL BE A
SERVANT A NURSE GIRL IF I CAN BE NO BETTER I ANSWERED
RIGHT SAID MR
ST
JOHN QUITE COOLLY
IF SUCH IS YOUR SPIRIT I
PROMISE TO AID YOU IN MY OWN TIME AND WAY
HE NOW RESUMED THE BOOK WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BEFORE TEA
I
SOON WITHDREW FOR I HAD TALKED AS MUCH AND SAT UP AS LONG AS MY
PRESENT STRENGTH WOULD PERMIT
CHAPTER XXX
THE MORE I KNEW OF THE INMATES OF MOOR HOUSE THE BETTER I LIKED THEM
IN
A FEW DAYS I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED MY HEALTH THAT I COULD SIT UP ALL DAY
AND WALK OUT SOMETIMES
I COULD JOIN WITH DIANA AND MARY IN ALL THEIR
OCCUPATIONS CONVERSE WITH THEM AS MUCH AS THEY WISHED AND AID THEM WHEN
AND WHERE THEY WOULD ALLOW ME
THERE WAS A REVIVING PLEASURE IN THIS
INTERCOURSE OF A KIND NOW TASTED BY ME FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PLEASURE
ARISING FROM PERFECT CONGENIALITY OF TASTES SENTIMENTS AND PRINCIPLES
I LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY ENJOYED DELIGHTED ME
WHAT THEY APPROVED I REVERENCED
THEY LOVED THEIR SEQUESTERED HOME
I
TOO IN THE GREY SMALL ANTIQUE STRUCTURE WITH ITS LOW ROOF ITS
LATTICED CASEMENTS ITS MOULDERING WALLS ITS AVENUE OF AGED FIRS ALL
GROWN ASLANT UNDER THE STRESS OF MOUNTAIN WINDS ITS GARDEN DARK WITH
YEW AND HOLLY AND WHERE NO FLOWERS BUT OF THE HARDIEST SPECIES WOULD
BLOOM FOUND A CHARM BOTH POTENT AND PERMANENT
THEY CLUNG TO THE PURPLE
MOORS BEHIND AND AROUND THEIR DWELLING TO THE HOLLOW VALE INTO WHICH THE
PEBBLY BRIDLE PATH LEADING FROM THEIR GATE DESCENDED AND WHICH WOUND
BETWEEN FERN BANKS FIRST AND THEN AMONGST A FEW OF THE WILDEST LITTLE
PASTURE FIELDS THAT EVER BORDERED A WILDERNESS OF HEATH OR GAVE
SUSTENANCE TO A FLOCK OF GREY MOORLAND SHEEP WITH THEIR LITTLE MOSSY
FACED LAMBS THEY CLUNG TO THIS SCENE I SAY WITH A PERFECT ENTHUSIASM
OF ATTACHMENT
I COULD COMPREHEND THE FEELING AND SHARE BOTH ITS
STRENGTH AND TRUTH
I SAW THE FASCINATION OF THE LOCALITY
I FELT THE
CONSECRATION OF ITS LONELINESS MY EYE FEASTED ON THE OUTLINE OF SWELL
AND SWEEP ON THE WILD COLOURING COMMUNICATED TO RIDGE AND DELL BY MOSS
BY HEATH BELL BY FLOWER SPRINKLED TURF BY BRILLIANT BRACKEN AND MELLOW
GRANITE CRAG
THESE DETAILS WERE JUST TO ME WHAT THEY WERE TO THEM SO
MANY PURE AND SWEET SOURCES OF PLEASURE
THE STRONG BLAST AND THE SOFT
BREEZE THE ROUGH AND THE HALCYON DAY THE HOURS OF SUNRISE AND SUNSET
THE MOONLIGHT AND THE CLOUDED NIGHT DEVELOPED FOR ME IN THESE REGIONS
THE SAME ATTRACTION AS FOR THEM WOUND ROUND MY FACULTIES THE SAME SPELL
THAT ENTRANCED THEIRS
INDOORS WE AGREED EQUALLY WELL
THEY WERE BOTH MORE ACCOMPLISHED AND
BETTER READ THAN I WAS BUT WITH EAGERNESS I FOLLOWED IN THE PATH OF
KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD TRODDEN BEFORE ME
I DEVOURED THE BOOKS THEY LENT ME
THEN IT WAS FULL SATISFACTION TO DISCUSS WITH THEM IN THE EVENING WHAT I
HAD PERUSED DURING THE DAY
THOUGHT FITTED THOUGHT OPINION MET OPINION
WE COINCIDED IN SHORT PERFECTLY
IF IN OUR TRIO THERE WAS A SUPERIOR AND A LEADER IT WAS DIANA
PHYSICALLY SHE FAR EXCELLED ME SHE WAS HANDSOME SHE WAS VIGOROUS
IN
HER ANIMAL SPIRITS THERE WAS AN AFFLUENCE OF LIFE AND CERTAINTY OF FLOW
SUCH AS EXCITED MY WONDER WHILE IT BAFFLED MY COMPREHENSION
I COULD
TALK A WHILE WHEN THE EVENING COMMENCED BUT THE FIRST GUSH OF VIVACITY
AND FLUENCY GONE I WAS FAIN TO SIT ON A STOOL AT DIANA'S FEET TO REST
MY HEAD ON HER KNEE AND LISTEN ALTERNATELY TO HER AND MARY WHILE THEY
SOUNDED THOROUGHLY THE TOPIC ON WHICH I HAD BUT TOUCHED
DIANA OFFERED
TO TEACH ME GERMAN
I LIKED TO LEARN OF HER I SAW THE PART OF
INSTRUCTRESS PLEASED AND SUITED HER THAT OF SCHOLAR PLEASED AND SUITED
ME NO LESS
OUR NATURES DOVETAILED MUTUAL AFFECTION OF THE STRONGEST
KIND WAS THE RESULT
THEY DISCOVERED I COULD DRAW THEIR PENCILS AND
COLOUR BOXES WERE IMMEDIATELY AT MY SERVICE
MY SKILL GREATER IN THIS
ONE POINT THAN THEIRS SURPRISED AND CHARMED THEM
MARY WOULD SIT AND
WATCH ME BY THE HOUR TOGETHER THEN SHE WOULD TAKE LESSONS AND A DOCILE
INTELLIGENT ASSIDUOUS PUPIL SHE MADE
THUS OCCUPIED AND MUTUALLY
ENTERTAINED DAYS PASSED LIKE HOURS AND WEEKS LIKE DAYS
AS TO MR
ST JOHN THE INTIMACY WHICH HAD ARISEN SO NATURALLY AND RAPIDLY
BETWEEN ME AND HIS SISTERS DID NOT EXTEND TO HIM
ONE REASON OF THE
DISTANCE YET OBSERVED BETWEEN US WAS THAT HE WAS COMPARATIVELY SELDOM AT
HOME A LARGE PROPORTION OF HIS TIME APPEARED DEVOTED TO VISITING THE
SICK AND POOR AMONG THE SCATTERED POPULATION OF HIS PARISH
NO WEATHER SEEMED TO HINDER HIM IN THESE PASTORAL EXCURSIONS RAIN OR
FAIR HE WOULD WHEN HIS HOURS OF MORNING STUDY WERE OVER TAKE HIS HAT
AND FOLLOWED BY HIS FATHER'S OLD POINTER CARLO GO OUT ON HIS MISSION
OF LOVE OR DUTY I SCARCELY KNOW IN WHICH LIGHT HE REGARDED IT
SOMETIMES WHEN THE DAY WAS VERY UNFAVOURABLE HIS SISTERS WOULD
EXPOSTULATE
HE WOULD THEN SAY WITH A PECULIAR SMILE MORE SOLEMN THAN
CHEERFUL
AND IF I LET A GUST OF WIND OR A SPRINKLING OF RAIN TURN ME ASIDE FROM
THESE EASY TASKS WHAT PREPARATION WOULD SUCH SLOTH BE FOR THE FUTURE I
PROPOSE TO MYSELF
DIANA AND MARY'S GENERAL ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WAS A SIGH AND SOME
MINUTES OF APPARENTLY MOURNFUL MEDITATION
BUT BESIDES HIS FREQUENT ABSENCES THERE WAS ANOTHER BARRIER TO
FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM HE SEEMED OF A RESERVED AN ABSTRACTED AND EVEN OF
A BROODING NATURE
ZEALOUS IN HIS MINISTERIAL LABOURS BLAMELESS IN HIS
LIFE AND HABITS HE YET DID NOT APPEAR TO ENJOY THAT MENTAL SERENITY
THAT INWARD CONTENT WHICH SHOULD BE THE REWARD OF EVERY SINCERE
CHRISTIAN AND PRACTICAL PHILANTHROPIST
OFTEN OF AN EVENING WHEN HE
SAT AT THE WINDOW HIS DESK AND PAPERS BEFORE HIM HE WOULD CEASE READING
OR WRITING REST HIS CHIN ON HIS HAND AND DELIVER HIMSELF UP TO I KNOW
NOT WHAT COURSE OF THOUGHT BUT THAT IT WAS PERTURBED AND EXCITING MIGHT
BE SEEN IN THE FREQUENT FLASH AND CHANGEFUL DILATION OF HIS EYE
I THINK MOREOVER THAT NATURE WAS NOT TO HIM THAT TREASURY OF DELIGHT IT
WAS TO HIS SISTERS
HE EXPRESSED ONCE AND BUT ONCE IN MY HEARING A
STRONG SENSE OF THE RUGGED CHARM OF THE HILLS AND AN INBORN AFFECTION
FOR THE DARK ROOF AND HOARY WALLS HE CALLED HIS HOME BUT THERE WAS MORE
OF GLOOM THAN PLEASURE IN THE TONE AND WORDS IN WHICH THE SENTIMENT WAS
MANIFESTED AND NEVER DID HE SEEM TO ROAM THE MOORS FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR
SOOTHING SILENCE NEVER SEEK OUT OR DWELL UPON THE THOUSAND PEACEFUL
DELIGHTS THEY COULD YIELD
INCOMMUNICATIVE AS HE WAS SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
OF GAUGING HIS MIND
I FIRST GOT AN IDEA OF ITS CALIBRE WHEN I HEARD HIM
PREACH IN HIS OWN CHURCH AT MORTON
I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE THAT SERMON
BUT IT IS PAST MY POWER
I CANNOT EVEN RENDER FAITHFULLY THE EFFECT IT
PRODUCED ON ME
IT BEGAN CALM AND INDEED AS FAR AS DELIVERY AND PITCH OF VOICE WENT IT
WAS CALM TO THE END AN EARNESTLY FELT YET STRICTLY RESTRAINED ZEAL
BREATHED SOON IN THE DISTINCT ACCENTS AND PROMPTED THE NERVOUS LANGUAGE
THIS GREW TO FORCE COMPRESSED CONDENSED CONTROLLED
THE HEART WAS
THRILLED THE MIND ASTONISHED BY THE POWER OF THE PREACHER NEITHER WERE
SOFTENED
THROUGHOUT THERE WAS A STRANGE BITTERNESS AN ABSENCE OF
CONSOLATORY GENTLENESS STERN ALLUSIONS TO CALVINISTIC
DOCTRINES ELECTION PREDESTINATION REPROBATION WERE FREQUENT AND EACH
REFERENCE TO THESE POINTS SOUNDED LIKE A SENTENCE PRONOUNCED FOR DOOM
WHEN HE HAD DONE INSTEAD OF FEELING BETTER CALMER MORE ENLIGHTENED BY
HIS DISCOURSE I EXPERIENCED AN INEXPRESSIBLE SADNESS FOR IT SEEMED TO
ME I KNOW NOT WHETHER EQUALLY SO TO OTHERS THAT THE ELOQUENCE TO WHICH
I HAD BEEN LISTENING HAD SPRUNG FROM A DEPTH WHERE LAY TURBID DREGS OF
DISAPPOINTMENT WHERE MOVED TROUBLING IMPULSES OF INSATIATE YEARNINGS AND
DISQUIETING ASPIRATIONS
I WAS SURE ST
JOHN RIVERS PURE LIVED
CONSCIENTIOUS ZEALOUS AS HE WAS HAD NOT YET FOUND THAT PEACE OF GOD
WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING HE HAD NO MORE FOUND IT I THOUGHT THAN
HAD I WITH MY CONCEALED AND RACKING REGRETS FOR MY BROKEN IDOL AND LOST
ELYSIUM REGRETS TO WHICH I HAVE LATTERLY AVOIDED REFERRING BUT WHICH
POSSESSED ME AND TYRANNISED OVER ME RUTHLESSLY
MEANTIME A MONTH WAS GONE
DIANA AND MARY WERE SOON TO LEAVE MOOR HOUSE
AND RETURN TO THE FAR DIFFERENT LIFE AND SCENE WHICH AWAITED THEM AS
GOVERNESSES IN A LARGE FASHIONABLE SOUTH OF ENGLAND CITY WHERE EACH
HELD A SITUATION IN FAMILIES BY WHOSE WEALTHY AND HAUGHTY MEMBERS THEY
WERE REGARDED ONLY AS HUMBLE DEPENDANTS AND WHO NEITHER KNEW NOR SOUGHT
OUT THEIR INNATE EXCELLENCES AND APPRECIATED ONLY THEIR ACQUIRED
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS THEY APPRECIATED THE SKILL OF THEIR COOK OR THE TASTE
OF THEIR WAITING WOMAN
MR
ST
JOHN HAD SAID NOTHING TO ME YET ABOUT
THE EMPLOYMENT HE HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN FOR ME YET IT BECAME URGENT
THAT I SHOULD HAVE A VOCATION OF SOME KIND
ONE MORNING BEING LEFT
ALONE WITH HIM A FEW MINUTES IN THE PARLOUR I VENTURED TO APPROACH THE
WINDOW RECESS WHICH HIS TABLE CHAIR AND DESK CONSECRATED AS A KIND OF
STUDY AND I WAS GOING TO SPEAK THOUGH NOT VERY WELL KNOWING IN WHAT
WORDS TO FRAME MY INQUIRY FOR IT IS AT ALL TIMES DIFFICULT TO BREAK THE
ICE OF RESERVE GLASSING OVER SUCH NATURES AS HIS WHEN HE SAVED ME THE
TROUBLE BY BEING THE FIRST TO COMMENCE A DIALOGUE
LOOKING UP AS I DREW NEAR YOU HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK OF ME HE SAID
YES I WISH TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE HEARD OF ANY SERVICE I CAN OFFER
MYSELF TO UNDERTAKE
I FOUND OR DEVISED SOMETHING FOR YOU THREE WEEKS AGO BUT AS YOU SEEMED
BOTH USEFUL AND HAPPY HERE AS MY SISTERS HAD EVIDENTLY BECOME ATTACHED
TO YOU AND YOUR SOCIETY GAVE THEM UNUSUAL PLEASURE I DEEMED IT
INEXPEDIENT TO BREAK IN ON YOUR MUTUAL COMFORT TILL THEIR APPROACHING
DEPARTURE FROM MARSH END SHOULD RENDER YOURS NECESSARY
AND THEY WILL GO IN THREE DAYS NOW I SAID
YES AND WHEN THEY GO I SHALL RETURN TO THE PARSONAGE AT MORTON HANNAH
WILL ACCOMPANY ME AND THIS OLD HOUSE WILL BE SHUT UP
I WAITED A FEW MOMENTS EXPECTING HE WOULD GO ON WITH THE SUBJECT FIRST
BROACHED BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE ENTERED ANOTHER TRAIN OF REFLECTION HIS
LOOK DENOTED ABSTRACTION FROM ME AND MY BUSINESS
I WAS OBLIGED TO
RECALL HIM TO A THEME WHICH WAS OF NECESSITY ONE OF CLOSE AND ANXIOUS
INTEREST TO ME
WHAT IS THE EMPLOYMENT YOU HAD IN VIEW MR
RIVERS I HOPE THIS DELAY
WILL NOT HAVE INCREASED THE DIFFICULTY OF SECURING IT
OH NO SINCE IT IS AN EMPLOYMENT WHICH DEPENDS ONLY ON ME TO GIVE AND
YOU TO ACCEPT
HE AGAIN PAUSED THERE SEEMED A RELUCTANCE TO CONTINUE
I GREW
IMPATIENT A RESTLESS MOVEMENT OR TWO AND AN EAGER AND EXACTING GLANCE
FASTENED ON HIS FACE CONVEYED THE FEELING TO HIM AS EFFECTUALLY AS WORDS
COULD HAVE DONE AND WITH LESS TROUBLE
YOU NEED BE IN NO HURRY TO HEAR HE SAID LET ME FRANKLY TELL YOU I
HAVE NOTHING ELIGIBLE OR PROFITABLE TO SUGGEST
BEFORE I EXPLAIN
RECALL IF YOU PLEASE MY NOTICE CLEARLY GIVEN THAT IF I HELPED YOU IT
MUST BE AS THE BLIND MAN WOULD HELP THE LAME
I AM POOR FOR I FIND
THAT WHEN I HAVE PAID MY FATHER'S DEBTS ALL THE PATRIMONY REMAINING TO
ME WILL BE THIS CRUMBLING GRANGE THE ROW OF SCATHED FIRS BEHIND AND THE
PATCH OF MOORISH SOIL WITH THE YEW TREES AND HOLLY BUSHES IN FRONT
I
AM OBSCURE RIVERS IS AN OLD NAME BUT OF THE THREE SOLE DESCENDANTS OF
THE RACE TWO EARN THE DEPENDANT'S CRUST AMONG STRANGERS AND THE THIRD
CONSIDERS HIMSELF AN ALIEN FROM HIS NATIVE COUNTRY NOT ONLY FOR LIFE
BUT IN DEATH
YES AND DEEMS AND IS BOUND TO DEEM HIMSELF HONOURED BY
THE LOT AND ASPIRES BUT AFTER THE DAY WHEN THE CROSS OF SEPARATION FROM
FLESHLY TIES SHALL BE LAID ON HIS SHOULDERS AND WHEN THE HEAD OF THAT
CHURCH MILITANT OF WHOSE HUMBLEST MEMBERS HE IS ONE SHALL GIVE THE WORD
'RISE FOLLOW ME
ST
JOHN SAID THESE WORDS AS HE PRONOUNCED HIS SERMONS WITH A QUIET
DEEP VOICE WITH AN UNFLUSHED CHEEK AND A CORUSCATING RADIANCE OF
GLANCE
HE RESUMED
AND SINCE I AM MYSELF POOR AND OBSCURE I CAN OFFER YOU BUT A SERVICE OF
POVERTY AND OBSCURITY
YOU MAY EVEN THINK IT DEGRADING FOR I SEE NOW
YOUR HABITS HAVE BEEN WHAT THE WORLD CALLS REFINED YOUR TASTES LEAN TO
THE IDEAL AND YOUR SOCIETY HAS AT LEAST BEEN AMONGST THE EDUCATED BUT
I CONSIDER THAT NO SERVICE DEGRADES WHICH CAN BETTER OUR RACE
I HOLD
THAT THE MORE ARID AND UNRECLAIMED THE SOIL WHERE THE CHRISTIAN
LABOURER'S TASK OF TILLAGE IS APPOINTED HIM THE SCANTIER THE MEED HIS
TOIL BRINGS THE HIGHER THE HONOUR
HIS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IS
THE DESTINY OF THE PIONEER AND THE FIRST PIONEERS OF THE GOSPEL WERE THE
APOSTLES THEIR CAPTAIN WAS JESUS THE REDEEMER HIMSELF
WELL I SAID AS HE AGAIN PAUSED PROCEED
HE LOOKED AT ME BEFORE HE PROCEEDED INDEED HE SEEMED LEISURELY TO READ
MY FACE AS IF ITS FEATURES AND LINES WERE CHARACTERS ON A PAGE
THE
CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THIS SCRUTINY HE PARTIALLY EXPRESSED IN HIS
SUCCEEDING OBSERVATIONS
I BELIEVE YOU WILL ACCEPT THE POST I OFFER YOU SAID HE AND HOLD IT
FOR A WHILE NOT PERMANENTLY THOUGH ANY MORE THAN I COULD PERMANENTLY
KEEP THE NARROW AND NARROWING THE TRANQUIL HIDDEN OFFICE OF ENGLISH
COUNTRY INCUMBENT FOR IN YOUR NATURE IS AN ALLOY AS DETRIMENTAL TO
REPOSE AS THAT IN MINE THOUGH OF A DIFFERENT KIND
DO EXPLAIN I URGED WHEN HE HALTED ONCE MORE
I WILL AND YOU SHALL HEAR HOW POOR THE PROPOSAL IS HOW TRIVIAL HOW
CRAMPING
I SHALL NOT STAY LONG AT MORTON NOW THAT MY FATHER IS DEAD
AND THAT I AM MY OWN MASTER
I SHALL LEAVE THE PLACE PROBABLY IN THE
COURSE OF A TWELVE MONTH BUT WHILE I DO STAY I WILL EXERT MYSELF TO THE
UTMOST FOR ITS IMPROVEMENT
MORTON WHEN I CAME TO IT TWO YEARS AGO HAD
NO SCHOOL THE CHILDREN OF THE POOR WERE EXCLUDED FROM EVERY HOPE OF
PROGRESS
I ESTABLISHED ONE FOR BOYS I MEAN NOW TO OPEN A SECOND SCHOOL
FOR GIRLS
I HAVE HIRED A BUILDING FOR THE PURPOSE WITH A COTTAGE OF
TWO ROOMS ATTACHED TO IT FOR THE MISTRESS'S HOUSE
HER SALARY WILL BE
THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR HER HOUSE IS ALREADY FURNISHED VERY SIMPLY BUT
SUFFICIENTLY BY THE KINDNESS OF A LADY MISS OLIVER THE ONLY DAUGHTER
OF THE SOLE RICH MAN IN MY PARISH MR
OLIVER THE PROPRIETOR OF A NEEDLE
FACTORY AND IRON FOUNDRY IN THE VALLEY
THE SAME LADY PAYS FOR THE
EDUCATION AND CLOTHING OF AN ORPHAN FROM THE WORKHOUSE ON CONDITION THAT
SHE SHALL AID THE MISTRESS IN SUCH MENIAL OFFICES CONNECTED WITH HER OWN
HOUSE AND THE SCHOOL AS HER OCCUPATION OF TEACHING WILL PREVENT HER
HAVING TIME TO DISCHARGE IN PERSON
WILL YOU BE THIS MISTRESS
HE PUT THE QUESTION RATHER HURRIEDLY HE SEEMED HALF TO EXPECT AN
INDIGNANT OR AT LEAST A DISDAINFUL REJECTION OF THE OFFER NOT KNOWING
ALL MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS THOUGH GUESSING SOME HE COULD NOT TELL IN
WHAT LIGHT THE LOT WOULD APPEAR TO ME
IN TRUTH IT WAS HUMBLE BUT THEN
IT WAS SHELTERED AND I WANTED A SAFE ASYLUM IT WAS PLODDING BUT THEN
COMPARED WITH THAT OF A GOVERNESS IN A RICH HOUSE IT WAS INDEPENDENT
AND THE FEAR OF SERVITUDE WITH STRANGERS ENTERED MY SOUL LIKE IRON IT
WAS NOT IGNOBLE NOT UNWORTHY NOT MENTALLY DEGRADING I MADE MY
DECISION
I THANK YOU FOR THE PROPOSAL MR
RIVERS AND I ACCEPT IT WITH ALL MY
HEART
BUT YOU COMPREHEND ME HE SAID
IT IS A VILLAGE SCHOOL YOUR SCHOLARS
WILL BE ONLY POOR GIRLS COTTAGERS' CHILDREN AT THE BEST FARMERS'
DAUGHTERS
KNITTING SEWING READING WRITING CIPHERING WILL BE ALL
YOU WILL HAVE TO TEACH
WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS
WHAT WITH THE LARGEST PORTION OF YOUR MIND SENTIMENTS TASTES
SAVE THEM TILL THEY ARE WANTED
THEY WILL KEEP
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU UNDERTAKE THEN
I DO
HE NOW SMILED AND NOT A BITTER OR A SAD SMILE BUT ONE WELL PLEASED AND
DEEPLY GRATIFIED
AND WHEN WILL YOU COMMENCE THE EXERCISE OF YOUR FUNCTION
I WILL GO TO MY HOUSE TO MORROW AND OPEN THE SCHOOL IF YOU LIKE NEXT
WEEK
VERY WELL SO BE IT
HE ROSE AND WALKED THROUGH THE ROOM
STANDING STILL HE AGAIN LOOKED AT
ME
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
WHAT DO YOU DISAPPROVE OF MR
RIVERS I ASKED
YOU WILL NOT STAY AT MORTON LONG NO NO
WHY WHAT IS YOUR REASON FOR SAYING SO
I READ IT IN YOUR EYE IT IS NOT OF THAT DESCRIPTION WHICH PROMISES THE
MAINTENANCE OF AN EVEN TENOR IN LIFE
I AM NOT AMBITIOUS
HE STARTED AT THE WORD AMBITIOUS HE REPEATED NO
WHAT MADE YOU
THINK OF AMBITION WHO IS AMBITIOUS I KNOW I AM BUT HOW DID YOU FIND
IT OUT
I WAS SPEAKING OF MYSELF
WELL IF YOU ARE NOT AMBITIOUS YOU ARE HE PAUSED
WHAT
I WAS GOING TO SAY IMPASSIONED BUT PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE
MISUNDERSTOOD THE WORD AND BEEN DISPLEASED
I MEAN THAT HUMAN
AFFECTIONS AND SYMPATHIES HAVE A MOST POWERFUL HOLD ON YOU
I AM SURE
YOU CANNOT LONG BE CONTENT TO PASS YOUR LEISURE IN SOLITUDE AND TO
DEVOTE YOUR WORKING HOURS TO A MONOTONOUS LABOUR WHOLLY VOID OF STIMULUS
ANY MORE THAN I CAN BE CONTENT HE ADDED WITH EMPHASIS TO LIVE HERE
BURIED IN MORASS PENT IN WITH MOUNTAINS MY NATURE THAT GOD GAVE ME
CONTRAVENED MY FACULTIES HEAVEN BESTOWED PARALYSED MADE USELESS
YOU
HEAR NOW HOW I CONTRADICT MYSELF
I WHO PREACHED CONTENTMENT WITH A
HUMBLE LOT AND JUSTIFIED THE VOCATION EVEN OF HEWERS OF WOOD AND DRAWERS
OF WATER IN GOD'S SERVICE I HIS ORDAINED MINISTER ALMOST RAVE IN MY
RESTLESSNESS
WELL PROPENSITIES AND PRINCIPLES MUST BE RECONCILED BY
SOME MEANS
HE LEFT THE ROOM
IN THIS BRIEF HOUR I HAD LEARNT MORE OF HIM THAN IN
THE WHOLE PREVIOUS MONTH YET STILL HE PUZZLED ME
DIANA AND MARY RIVERS BECAME MORE SAD AND SILENT AS THE DAY APPROACHED
FOR LEAVING THEIR BROTHER AND THEIR HOME
THEY BOTH TRIED TO APPEAR AS
USUAL BUT THE SORROW THEY HAD TO STRUGGLE AGAINST WAS ONE THAT COULD NOT
BE ENTIRELY CONQUERED OR CONCEALED
DIANA INTIMATED THAT THIS WOULD BE A
DIFFERENT PARTING FROM ANY THEY HAD EVER YET KNOWN
IT WOULD PROBABLY
AS FAR AS ST
JOHN WAS CONCERNED BE A PARTING FOR YEARS IT MIGHT BE A
PARTING FOR LIFE
HE WILL SACRIFICE ALL TO HIS LONG FRAMED RESOLVES SHE SAID NATURAL
AFFECTION AND FEELINGS MORE POTENT STILL
ST
JOHN LOOKS QUIET JANE
BUT HE HIDES A FEVER IN HIS VITALS
YOU WOULD THINK HIM GENTLE YET IN
SOME THINGS HE IS INEXORABLE AS DEATH AND THE WORST OF IT IS MY
CONSCIENCE WILL HARDLY PERMIT ME TO DISSUADE HIM FROM HIS SEVERE
DECISION CERTAINLY I CANNOT FOR A MOMENT BLAME HIM FOR IT
IT IS
RIGHT NOBLE CHRISTIAN YET IT BREAKS MY HEART AND THE TEARS GUSHED
TO HER FINE EYES
MARY BENT HER HEAD LOW OVER HER WORK
WE ARE NOW WITHOUT FATHER WE SHALL SOON BE WITHOUT HOME AND BROTHER
SHE MURMURED
AT THAT MOMENT A LITTLE ACCIDENT SUPERVENED WHICH SEEMED DECREED BY FATE
PURPOSELY TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF THE ADAGE THAT MISFORTUNES NEVER COME
SINGLY AND TO ADD TO THEIR DISTRESSES THE VEXING ONE OF THE SLIP
BETWEEN THE CUP AND THE LIP
ST
JOHN PASSED THE WINDOW READING A
LETTER
HE ENTERED
OUR UNCLE JOHN IS DEAD SAID HE
BOTH THE SISTERS SEEMED STRUCK NOT SHOCKED OR APPALLED THE TIDINGS
APPEARED IN THEIR EYES RATHER MOMENTOUS THAN AFFLICTING
DEAD REPEATED DIANA
YES
SHE RIVETED A SEARCHING GAZE ON HER BROTHER'S FACE
AND WHAT THEN SHE
DEMANDED IN A LOW VOICE
WHAT THEN DIE HE REPLIED MAINTAINING A MARBLE IMMOBILITY OF FEATURE
WHAT THEN WHY NOTHING
READ
HE THREW THE LETTER INTO HER LAP
SHE GLANCED OVER IT AND HANDED IT TO
MARY
MARY PERUSED IT IN SILENCE AND RETURNED IT TO HER BROTHER
ALL
THREE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND ALL THREE SMILED A DREARY PENSIVE SMILE
ENOUGH
AMEN WE CAN YET LIVE SAID DIANA AT LAST
AT ANY RATE IT MAKES US NO WORSE OFF THAN WE WERE BEFORE REMARKED
MARY
ONLY IT FORCES RATHER STRONGLY ON THE MIND THE PICTURE OF WHAT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN SAID MR
RIVERS AND CONTRASTS IT SOMEWHAT TOO VIVIDLY WITH
WHAT IS
HE FOLDED THE LETTER LOCKED IT IN HIS DESK AND AGAIN WENT OUT
FOR SOME MINUTES NO ONE SPOKE
DIANA THEN TURNED TO ME
JANE YOU WILL WONDER AT US AND OUR MYSTERIES SHE SAID AND THINK US
HARD HEARTED BEINGS NOT TO BE MORE MOVED AT THE DEATH OF SO NEAR A
RELATION AS AN UNCLE BUT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM OR KNOWN HIM
HE WAS MY
MOTHER'S BROTHER
MY FATHER AND HE QUARRELLED LONG AGO
IT WAS BY HIS
ADVICE THAT MY FATHER RISKED MOST OF HIS PROPERTY IN THE SPECULATION THAT
RUINED HIM
MUTUAL RECRIMINATION PASSED BETWEEN THEM THEY PARTED IN
ANGER AND WERE NEVER RECONCILED
MY UNCLE ENGAGED AFTERWARDS IN MORE
PROSPEROUS UNDERTAKINGS IT APPEARS HE REALISED A FORTUNE OF TWENTY
THOUSAND POUNDS
HE WAS NEVER MARRIED AND HAD NO NEAR KINDRED BUT
OURSELVES AND ONE OTHER PERSON NOT MORE CLOSELY RELATED THAN WE
MY
FATHER ALWAYS CHERISHED THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD ATONE FOR HIS ERROR BY
LEAVING HIS POSSESSIONS TO US THAT LETTER INFORMS US THAT HE HAS
BEQUEATHED EVERY PENNY TO THE OTHER RELATION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
THIRTY GUINEAS TO BE DIVIDED BETWEEN ST
JOHN DIANA AND MARY RIVERS
FOR THE PURCHASE OF THREE MOURNING RINGS
HE HAD A RIGHT OF COURSE TO
DO AS HE PLEASED AND YET A MOMENTARY DAMP IS CAST ON THE SPIRITS BY THE
RECEIPT OF SUCH NEWS
MARY AND I WOULD HAVE ESTEEMED OURSELVES RICH WITH
A THOUSAND POUNDS EACH AND TO ST
JOHN SUCH A SUM WOULD HAVE BEEN
VALUABLE FOR THE GOOD IT WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO DO
THIS EXPLANATION GIVEN THE SUBJECT WAS DROPPED AND NO FURTHER REFERENCE
MADE TO IT BY EITHER MR
RIVERS OR HIS SISTERS
THE NEXT DAY I LEFT
MARSH END FOR MORTON
THE DAY AFTER DIANA AND MARY QUITTED IT FOR
DISTANT B
IN A WEEK MR
RIVERS AND HANNAH REPAIRED TO THE PARSONAGE
AND SO THE OLD GRANGE WAS ABANDONED
CHAPTER XXXI
MY HOME THEN WHEN I AT LAST FIND A HOME IS A COTTAGE A LITTLE ROOM
WITH WHITEWASHED WALLS AND A SANDED FLOOR CONTAINING FOUR PAINTED CHAIRS
AND A TABLE A CLOCK A CUPBOARD WITH TWO OR THREE PLATES AND DISHES
AND A SET OF TEA THINGS IN DELF
ABOVE A CHAMBER OF THE SAME DIMENSIONS
AS THE KITCHEN WITH A DEAL BEDSTEAD AND CHEST OF DRAWERS SMALL YET TOO
LARGE TO BE FILLED WITH MY SCANTY WARDROBE THOUGH THE KINDNESS OF MY
GENTLE AND GENEROUS FRIENDS HAS INCREASED THAT BY A MODEST STOCK OF SUCH
THINGS AS ARE NECESSARY
IT IS EVENING
I HAVE DISMISSED WITH THE FEE OF AN ORANGE THE LITTLE
ORPHAN WHO SERVES ME AS A HANDMAID
I AM SITTING ALONE ON THE HEARTH
THIS MORNING THE VILLAGE SCHOOL OPENED
I HAD TWENTY SCHOLARS
BUT
THREE OF THE NUMBER CAN READ NONE WRITE OR CIPHER
SEVERAL KNIT AND A
FEW SEW A LITTLE
THEY SPEAK WITH THE BROADEST ACCENT OF THE DISTRICT
AT PRESENT THEY AND I HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING EACH OTHER'S
LANGUAGE
SOME OF THEM ARE UNMANNERED ROUGH INTRACTABLE AS WELL AS
IGNORANT BUT OTHERS ARE DOCILE HAVE A WISH TO LEARN AND EVINCE A
DISPOSITION THAT PLEASES ME
I MUST NOT FORGET THAT THESE COARSELY CLAD
LITTLE PEASANTS ARE OF FLESH AND BLOOD AS GOOD AS THE SCIONS OF GENTLEST
GENEALOGY AND THAT THE GERMS OF NATIVE EXCELLENCE REFINEMENT
INTELLIGENCE KIND FEELING ARE AS LIKELY TO EXIST IN THEIR HEARTS AS IN
THOSE OF THE BEST BORN
MY DUTY WILL BE TO DEVELOP THESE GERMS SURELY I
SHALL FIND SOME HAPPINESS IN DISCHARGING THAT OFFICE
MUCH ENJOYMENT I
DO NOT EXPECT IN THE LIFE OPENING BEFORE ME YET IT WILL DOUBTLESS IF I
REGULATE MY MIND AND EXERT MY POWERS AS I OUGHT YIELD ME ENOUGH TO LIVE
ON FROM DAY TO DAY
WAS I VERY GLEEFUL SETTLED CONTENT DURING THE HOURS I PASSED IN YONDER
BARE HUMBLE SCHOOLROOM THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON NOT TO DECEIVE
MYSELF I MUST REPLY NO I FELT DESOLATE TO A DEGREE
I FELT YES
IDIOT THAT I AM I FELT DEGRADED
I DOUBTED I HAD TAKEN A STEP WHICH
SANK INSTEAD OF RAISING ME IN THE SCALE OF SOCIAL EXISTENCE
I WAS
WEAKLY DISMAYED AT THE IGNORANCE THE POVERTY THE COARSENESS OF ALL I
HEARD AND SAW ROUND ME
BUT LET ME NOT HATE AND DESPISE MYSELF TOO MUCH
FOR THESE FEELINGS I KNOW THEM TO BE WRONG THAT IS A GREAT STEP GAINED
I SHALL STRIVE TO OVERCOME THEM
TO MORROW I TRUST I SHALL GET THE
BETTER OF THEM PARTIALLY AND IN A FEW WEEKS PERHAPS THEY WILL BE QUITE
SUBDUED
IN A FEW MONTHS IT IS POSSIBLE THE HAPPINESS OF SEEING
PROGRESS AND A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER IN MY SCHOLARS MAY SUBSTITUTE
GRATIFICATION FOR DISGUST
MEANTIME LET ME ASK MYSELF ONE QUESTION WHICH IS BETTER TO HAVE
SURRENDERED TO TEMPTATION LISTENED TO PASSION MADE NO PAINFUL EFFORT NO
STRUGGLE BUT TO HAVE SUNK DOWN IN THE SILKEN SNARE FALLEN ASLEEP ON
THE FLOWERS COVERING IT WAKENED IN A SOUTHERN CLIME AMONGST THE
LUXURIES OF A PLEASURE VILLA TO HAVE BEEN NOW LIVING IN FRANCE MR
ROCHESTER'S MISTRESS DELIRIOUS WITH HIS LOVE HALF MY TIME FOR HE
WOULD OH YES HE WOULD HAVE LOVED ME WELL FOR A WHILE
HE DID LOVE
ME NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE ME SO AGAIN
I SHALL NEVER MORE KNOW THE SWEET
HOMAGE GIVEN TO BEAUTY YOUTH AND GRACE FOR NEVER TO ANY ONE ELSE SHALL
I SEEM TO POSSESS THESE CHARMS
HE WAS FOND AND PROUD OF ME IT IS WHAT
NO MAN BESIDES WILL EVER BE BUT WHERE AM I WANDERING AND WHAT AM I
SAYING AND ABOVE ALL FEELING WHETHER IS IT BETTER I ASK TO BE A
SLAVE IN A FOOL'S PARADISE AT MARSEILLES FEVERED WITH DELUSIVE BLISS ONE
HOUR SUFFOCATING WITH THE BITTEREST TEARS OF REMORSE AND SHAME THE
NEXT OR TO BE A VILLAGE SCHOOLMISTRESS FREE AND HONEST IN A BREEZY
MOUNTAIN NOOK IN THE HEALTHY HEART OF ENGLAND
YES I FEEL NOW THAT I WAS RIGHT WHEN I ADHERED TO PRINCIPLE AND LAW AND
SCORNED AND CRUSHED THE INSANE PROMPTINGS OF A FRENZIED MOMENT
GOD
DIRECTED ME TO A CORRECT CHOICE I THANK HIS PROVIDENCE FOR THE GUIDANCE
HAVING BROUGHT MY EVENTIDE MUSINGS TO THIS POINT I ROSE WENT TO MY
DOOR AND LOOKED AT THE SUNSET OF THE HARVEST DAY AND AT THE QUIET
FIELDS BEFORE MY COTTAGE WHICH WITH THE SCHOOL WAS DISTANT HALF A MILE
FROM THE VILLAGE
THE BIRDS WERE SINGING THEIR LAST STRAINS
THE AIR WAS MILD THE DEW WAS BALM
WHILE I LOOKED I THOUGHT MYSELF HAPPY AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND MYSELF
ERE LONG WEEPING AND WHY FOR THE DOOM WHICH HAD REFT ME FROM ADHESION
TO MY MASTER FOR HIM I WAS NO MORE TO SEE FOR THE DESPERATE GRIEF AND
FATAL FURY CONSEQUENCES OF MY DEPARTURE WHICH MIGHT NOW PERHAPS BE
DRAGGING HIM FROM THE PATH OF RIGHT TOO FAR TO LEAVE HOPE OF ULTIMATE
RESTORATION THITHER
AT THIS THOUGHT I TURNED MY FACE ASIDE FROM THE
LOVELY SKY OF EVE AND LONELY VALE OF MORTON I SAY LONELY FOR IN THAT
BEND OF IT VISIBLE TO ME THERE WAS NO BUILDING APPARENT SAVE THE CHURCH
AND THE PARSONAGE HALF HID IN TREES AND QUITE AT THE EXTREMITY THE
ROOF OF VALE HALL WHERE THE RICH MR
OLIVER AND HIS DAUGHTER LIVED
I
HID MY EYES AND LEANT MY HEAD AGAINST THE STONE FRAME OF MY DOOR BUT
SOON A SLIGHT NOISE NEAR THE WICKET WHICH SHUT IN MY TINY GARDEN FROM THE
MEADOW BEYOND IT MADE ME LOOK UP
A DOG OLD CARLO MR
RIVERS' POINTER
AS I SAW IN A MOMENT WAS PUSHING THE GATE WITH HIS NOSE AND ST
JOHN
HIMSELF LEANT UPON IT WITH FOLDED ARMS HIS BROW KNIT HIS GAZE GRAVE
ALMOST TO DISPLEASURE FIXED ON ME
I ASKED HIM TO COME IN
NO I CANNOT STAY I HAVE ONLY BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE PARCEL MY SISTERS
LEFT FOR YOU
I THINK IT CONTAINS A COLOUR BOX PENCILS AND PAPER
I APPROACHED TO TAKE IT A WELCOME GIFT IT WAS
HE EXAMINED MY FACE I
THOUGHT WITH AUSTERITY AS I CAME NEAR THE TRACES OF TEARS WERE
DOUBTLESS VERY VISIBLE UPON IT
HAVE YOU FOUND YOUR FIRST DAY'S WORK HARDER THAN YOU EXPECTED HE
ASKED
OH NO ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IN TIME I SHALL GET ON WITH MY
SCHOLARS VERY WELL
BUT PERHAPS YOUR ACCOMMODATIONS YOUR COTTAGE YOUR FURNITURE HAVE
DISAPPOINTED YOUR EXPECTATIONS THEY ARE IN TRUTH SCANTY ENOUGH BUT
I INTERRUPTED
MY COTTAGE IS CLEAN AND WEATHER PROOF MY FURNITURE SUFFICIENT AND
COMMODIOUS
ALL I SEE HAS MADE ME THANKFUL NOT DESPONDENT
I AM NOT
ABSOLUTELY SUCH A FOOL AND SENSUALIST AS TO REGRET THE ABSENCE OF A
CARPET A SOFA AND SILVER PLATE BESIDES FIVE WEEKS AGO I HAD NOTHING I
WAS AN OUTCAST A BEGGAR A VAGRANT NOW I HAVE ACQUAINTANCE A HOME A
BUSINESS
I WONDER AT THE GOODNESS OF GOD THE GENEROSITY OF MY FRIENDS
THE BOUNTY OF MY LOT
I DO NOT REPINE
BUT YOU FEEL SOLITUDE AN OPPRESSION THE LITTLE HOUSE THERE BEHIND YOU
IS DARK AND EMPTY
I HAVE HARDLY HAD TIME YET TO ENJOY A SENSE OF TRANQUILLITY MUCH LESS
TO GROW IMPATIENT UNDER ONE OF LONELINESS
VERY WELL I HOPE YOU FEEL THE CONTENT YOU EXPRESS AT ANY RATE YOUR
GOOD SENSE WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS TOO SOON YET TO YIELD TO THE
VACILLATING FEARS OF LOT'S WIFE
WHAT YOU HAD LEFT BEFORE I SAW YOU OF
COURSE I DO NOT KNOW BUT I COUNSEL YOU TO RESIST FIRMLY EVERY TEMPTATION
WHICH WOULD INCLINE YOU TO LOOK BACK PURSUE YOUR PRESENT CAREER
STEADILY FOR SOME MONTHS AT LEAST
IT IS WHAT I MEAN TO DO I ANSWERED
ST
JOHN CONTINUED
IT IS HARD WORK TO CONTROL THE WORKINGS OF INCLINATION AND TURN THE BENT
OF NATURE BUT THAT IT MAY BE DONE I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE
GOD HAS
GIVEN US IN A MEASURE THE POWER TO MAKE OUR OWN FATE AND WHEN OUR
ENERGIES SEEM TO DEMAND A SUSTENANCE THEY CANNOT GET WHEN OUR WILL
STRAINS AFTER A PATH WE MAY NOT FOLLOW WE NEED NEITHER STARVE FROM
INANITION NOR STAND STILL IN DESPAIR WE HAVE BUT TO SEEK ANOTHER
NOURISHMENT FOR THE MIND AS STRONG AS THE FORBIDDEN FOOD IT LONGED TO
TASTE AND PERHAPS PURER AND TO HEW OUT FOR THE ADVENTUROUS FOOT A ROAD
AS DIRECT AND BROAD AS THE ONE FORTUNE HAS BLOCKED UP AGAINST US IF
ROUGHER THAN IT
A YEAR AGO I WAS MYSELF INTENSELY MISERABLE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HAD
MADE A MISTAKE IN ENTERING THE MINISTRY ITS UNIFORM DUTIES WEARIED ME TO
DEATH
I BURNT FOR THE MORE ACTIVE LIFE OF THE WORLD FOR THE MORE
EXCITING TOILS OF A LITERARY CAREER FOR THE DESTINY OF AN ARTIST
AUTHOR ORATOR ANYTHING RATHER THAN THAT OF A PRIEST YES THE HEART OF
A POLITICIAN OF A SOLDIER OF A VOTARY OF GLORY A LOVER OF RENOWN A
LUSTER AFTER POWER BEAT UNDER MY CURATE'S SURPLICE
I CONSIDERED MY
LIFE WAS SO WRETCHED IT MUST BE CHANGED OR I MUST DIE
AFTER A SEASON
OF DARKNESS AND STRUGGLING LIGHT BROKE AND RELIEF FELL MY CRAMPED
EXISTENCE ALL AT ONCE SPREAD OUT TO A PLAIN WITHOUT BOUNDS MY POWERS
HEARD A CALL FROM HEAVEN TO RISE GATHER THEIR FULL STRENGTH SPREAD
THEIR WINGS AND MOUNT BEYOND KEN
GOD HAD AN ERRAND FOR ME TO BEAR
WHICH AFAR TO DELIVER IT WELL SKILL AND STRENGTH COURAGE AND
ELOQUENCE THE BEST QUALIFICATIONS OF SOLDIER STATESMAN AND ORATOR
WERE ALL NEEDED FOR THESE ALL CENTRE IN THE GOOD MISSIONARY
A MISSIONARY I RESOLVED TO BE
FROM THAT MOMENT MY STATE OF MIND
CHANGED THE FETTERS DISSOLVED AND DROPPED FROM EVERY FACULTY LEAVING
NOTHING OF BONDAGE BUT ITS GALLING SORENESS WHICH TIME ONLY CAN HEAL
MY
FATHER INDEED IMPOSED THE DETERMINATION BUT SINCE HIS DEATH I HAVE
NOT A LEGITIMATE OBSTACLE TO CONTEND WITH SOME AFFAIRS SETTLED A
SUCCESSOR FOR MORTON PROVIDED AN ENTANGLEMENT OR TWO OF THE FEELINGS
BROKEN THROUGH OR CUT ASUNDER A LAST CONFLICT WITH HUMAN WEAKNESS IN
WHICH I KNOW I SHALL OVERCOME BECAUSE I HAVE VOWED THAT I WILL
OVERCOME AND I LEAVE EUROPE FOR THE EAST
HE SAID THIS IN HIS PECULIAR SUBDUED YET EMPHATIC VOICE LOOKING WHEN
HE HAD CEASED SPEAKING NOT AT ME BUT AT THE SETTING SUN AT WHICH I
LOOKED TOO
BOTH HE AND I HAD OUR BACKS TOWARDS THE PATH LEADING UP THE
FIELD TO THE WICKET
WE HAD HEARD NO STEP ON THAT GRASS GROWN TRACK THE
WATER RUNNING IN THE VALE WAS THE ONE LULLING SOUND OF THE HOUR AND
SCENE WE MIGHT WELL THEN START WHEN A GAY VOICE SWEET AS A SILVER BELL
EXCLAIMED
GOOD EVENING MR
RIVERS
AND GOOD EVENING OLD CARLO
YOUR DOG IS
QUICKER TO RECOGNISE HIS FRIENDS THAN YOU ARE SIR HE PRICKED HIS EARS
AND WAGGED HIS TAIL WHEN I WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FIELD AND YOU HAVE
YOUR BACK TOWARDS ME NOW
IT WAS TRUE
THOUGH MR
RIVERS HAD STARTED AT THE FIRST OF THOSE MUSICAL
ACCENTS AS IF A THUNDERBOLT HAD SPLIT A CLOUD OVER HIS HEAD HE STOOD
YET AT THE CLOSE OF THE SENTENCE IN THE SAME ATTITUDE IN WHICH THE
SPEAKER HAD SURPRISED HIM HIS ARM RESTING ON THE GATE HIS FACE DIRECTED
TOWARDS THE WEST
HE TURNED AT LAST WITH MEASURED DELIBERATION
A
VISION AS IT SEEMED TO ME HAD RISEN AT HIS SIDE
THERE APPEARED
WITHIN THREE FEET OF HIM A FORM CLAD IN PURE WHITE A YOUTHFUL GRACEFUL
FORM FULL YET FINE IN CONTOUR AND WHEN AFTER BENDING TO CARESS CARLO
IT LIFTED UP ITS HEAD AND THREW BACK A LONG VEIL THERE BLOOMED UNDER
HIS GLANCE A FACE OF PERFECT BEAUTY
PERFECT BEAUTY IS A STRONG
EXPRESSION BUT I DO NOT RETRACE OR QUALIFY IT AS SWEET FEATURES AS EVER
THE TEMPERATE CLIME OF ALBION MOULDED AS PURE HUES OF ROSE AND LILY AS
EVER HER HUMID GALES AND VAPOURY SKIES GENERATED AND SCREENED JUSTIFIED
IN THIS INSTANCE THE TERM
NO CHARM WAS WANTING NO DEFECT WAS
PERCEPTIBLE THE YOUNG GIRL HAD REGULAR AND DELICATE LINEAMENTS EYES
SHAPED AND COLOURED AS WE SEE THEM IN LOVELY PICTURES LARGE AND DARK
AND FULL THE LONG AND SHADOWY EYELASH WHICH ENCIRCLES A FINE EYE WITH SO
SOFT A FASCINATION THE PENCILLED BROW WHICH GIVES SUCH CLEARNESS THE
WHITE SMOOTH FOREHEAD WHICH ADDS SUCH REPOSE TO THE LIVELIER BEAUTIES OF
TINT AND RAY THE CHEEK OVAL FRESH AND SMOOTH THE LIPS FRESH TOO
RUDDY HEALTHY SWEETLY FORMED THE EVEN AND GLEAMING TEETH WITHOUT FLAW
THE SMALL DIMPLED CHIN THE ORNAMENT OF RICH PLENTEOUS TRESSES ALL
ADVANTAGES IN SHORT WHICH COMBINED REALISE THE IDEAL OF BEAUTY WERE
FULLY HERS
I WONDERED AS I LOOKED AT THIS FAIR CREATURE I ADMIRED HER
WITH MY WHOLE HEART
NATURE HAD SURELY FORMED HER IN A PARTIAL MOOD
AND FORGETTING HER USUAL STINTED STEP MOTHER DOLE OF GIFTS HAD ENDOWED
THIS HER DARLING WITH A GRAND DAME'S BOUNTY
WHAT DID ST
JOHN RIVERS THINK OF THIS EARTHLY ANGEL I NATURALLY ASKED
MYSELF THAT QUESTION AS I SAW HIM TURN TO HER AND LOOK AT HER AND AS
NATURALLY I SOUGHT THE ANSWER TO THE INQUIRY IN HIS COUNTENANCE
HE HAD
ALREADY WITHDRAWN HIS EYE FROM THE PERI AND WAS LOOKING AT A HUMBLE TUFT
OF DAISIES WHICH GREW BY THE WICKET
A LOVELY EVENING BUT LATE FOR YOU TO BE OUT ALONE HE SAID AS HE
CRUSHED THE SNOWY HEADS OF THE CLOSED FLOWERS WITH HIS FOOT
OH I ONLY CAME HOME FROM S SHE MENTIONED THE NAME OF A LARGE TOWN
SOME TWENTY MILES DISTANT THIS AFTERNOON
PAPA TOLD ME YOU HAD OPENED
YOUR SCHOOL AND THAT THE NEW MISTRESS WAS COME AND SO I PUT ON MY
BONNET AFTER TEA AND RAN UP THE VALLEY TO SEE HER THIS IS SHE
POINTING TO ME
IT IS SAID ST
JOHN
DO YOU THINK YOU SHALL LIKE MORTON SHE ASKED OF ME WITH A DIRECT AND
NAIVE SIMPLICITY OF TONE AND MANNER PLEASING IF CHILD LIKE
I HOPE I SHALL
I HAVE MANY INDUCEMENTS TO DO SO
DID YOU FIND YOUR SCHOLARS AS ATTENTIVE AS YOU EXPECTED
QUITE
DO YOU LIKE YOUR HOUSE
VERY MUCH
HAVE I FURNISHED IT NICELY
VERY NICELY INDEED
AND MADE A GOOD CHOICE OF AN ATTENDANT FOR YOU IN ALICE WOOD
YOU HAVE INDEED
SHE IS TEACHABLE AND HANDY THIS THEN I THOUGHT
IS MISS OLIVER THE HEIRESS FAVOURED IT SEEMS IN THE GIFTS OF FORTUNE
AS WELL AS IN THOSE OF NATURE WHAT HAPPY COMBINATION OF THE PLANETS
PRESIDED OVER HER BIRTH I WONDER
I SHALL COME UP AND HELP YOU TO TEACH SOMETIMES SHE ADDED
IT WILL
BE A CHANGE FOR ME TO VISIT YOU NOW AND THEN AND I LIKE A CHANGE
MR
RIVERS I HAVE BEEN SO GAY DURING MY STAY AT S
LAST NIGHT OR RATHER
THIS MORNING I WAS DANCING TILL TWO O'CLOCK
THE TH REGIMENT ARE
STATIONED THERE SINCE THE RIOTS AND THE OFFICERS ARE THE MOST AGREEABLE
MEN IN THE WORLD THEY PUT ALL OUR YOUNG KNIFE GRINDERS AND SCISSOR
MERCHANTS TO SHAME
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MR
ST
JOHN'S UNDER LIP PROTRUDED AND HIS UPPER
LIP CURLED A MOMENT
HIS MOUTH CERTAINLY LOOKED A GOOD DEAL COMPRESSED
AND THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE UNUSUALLY STERN AND SQUARE AS THE
LAUGHING GIRL GAVE HIM THIS INFORMATION
HE LIFTED HIS GAZE TOO FROM
THE DAISIES AND TURNED IT ON HER
AN UNSMILING A SEARCHING A MEANING
GAZE IT WAS
SHE ANSWERED IT WITH A SECOND LAUGH AND LAUGHTER WELL
BECAME HER YOUTH HER ROSES HER DIMPLES HER BRIGHT EYES
AS HE STOOD MUTE AND GRAVE SHE AGAIN FELL TO CARESSING CARLO
POOR
CARLO LOVES ME SAID SHE
HE IS NOT STERN AND DISTANT TO HIS
FRIENDS AND IF HE COULD SPEAK HE WOULD NOT BE SILENT
AS SHE PATTED THE DOG'S HEAD BENDING WITH NATIVE GRACE BEFORE HIS YOUNG
AND AUSTERE MASTER I SAW A GLOW RISE TO THAT MASTER'S FACE
I SAW HIS
SOLEMN EYE MELT WITH SUDDEN FIRE AND FLICKER WITH RESISTLESS EMOTION
FLUSHED AND KINDLED THUS HE LOOKED NEARLY AS BEAUTIFUL FOR A MAN AS SHE
FOR A WOMAN
HIS CHEST HEAVED ONCE AS IF HIS LARGE HEART WEARY OF
DESPOTIC CONSTRICTION HAD EXPANDED DESPITE THE WILL AND MADE A
VIGOROUS BOUND FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF LIBERTY
BUT HE CURBED IT I THINK
AS A RESOLUTE RIDER WOULD CURB A REARING STEED
HE RESPONDED NEITHER BY
WORD NOR MOVEMENT TO THE GENTLE ADVANCES MADE HIM
PAPA SAYS YOU NEVER COME TO SEE US NOW CONTINUED MISS OLIVER LOOKING
UP
YOU ARE QUITE A STRANGER AT VALE HALL
HE IS ALONE THIS EVENING
AND NOT VERY WELL WILL YOU RETURN WITH ME AND VISIT HIM
IT IS NOT A SEASONABLE HOUR TO INTRUDE ON MR
OLIVER ANSWERED ST
JOHN
NOT A SEASONABLE HOUR BUT I DECLARE IT IS
IT IS JUST THE HOUR WHEN
PAPA MOST WANTS COMPANY WHEN THE WORKS ARE CLOSED AND HE HAS NO BUSINESS
TO OCCUPY HIM
NOW MR
RIVERS DO COME
WHY ARE YOU SO VERY SHY AND
SO VERY SOMBRE SHE FILLED UP THE HIATUS HIS SILENCE LEFT BY A REPLY OF
HER OWN
I FORGOT SHE EXCLAIMED SHAKING HER BEAUTIFUL CURLED HEAD AS IF
SHOCKED AT HERSELF
I AM SO GIDDY AND THOUGHTLESS DO EXCUSE ME
IT
HAD SLIPPED MY MEMORY THAT YOU HAVE GOOD REASONS TO BE INDISPOSED FOR
JOINING IN MY CHATTER
DIANA AND MARY HAVE LEFT YOU AND MOOR HOUSE IS
SHUT UP AND YOU ARE SO LONELY
I AM SURE I PITY YOU
DO COME AND SEE
PAPA
NOT TO NIGHT MISS ROSAMOND NOT TO NIGHT
MR
ST
JOHN SPOKE ALMOST LIKE AN AUTOMATON HIMSELF ONLY KNEW THE EFFORT
IT COST HIM THUS TO REFUSE
WELL IF YOU ARE SO OBSTINATE I WILL LEAVE YOU FOR I DARE NOT STAY ANY
LONGER THE DEW BEGINS TO FALL
GOOD EVENING
SHE HELD OUT HER HAND
HE JUST TOUCHED IT
GOOD EVENING HE REPEATED
IN A VOICE LOW AND HOLLOW AS AN ECHO
SHE TURNED BUT IN A MOMENT
RETURNED
ARE YOU WELL SHE ASKED
WELL MIGHT SHE PUT THE QUESTION HIS FACE WAS
BLANCHED AS HER GOWN
QUITE WELL HE ENUNCIATED AND WITH A BOW HE LEFT THE GATE
SHE WENT
ONE WAY HE ANOTHER
SHE TURNED TWICE TO GAZE AFTER HIM AS SHE TRIPPED
FAIRY LIKE DOWN THE FIELD HE AS HE STRODE FIRMLY ACROSS NEVER TURNED
AT ALL
THIS SPECTACLE OF ANOTHER'S SUFFERING AND SACRIFICE RAPT MY THOUGHTS FROM
EXCLUSIVE MEDITATION ON MY OWN
DIANA RIVERS HAD DESIGNATED HER BROTHER
INEXORABLE AS DEATH SHE HAD NOT EXAGGERATED
CHAPTER XXXII
I CONTINUED THE LABOURS OF THE VILLAGE SCHOOL AS ACTIVELY AND FAITHFULLY
AS I COULD
IT WAS TRULY HARD WORK AT FIRST
SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE
WITH ALL MY EFFORTS I COULD COMPREHEND MY SCHOLARS AND THEIR NATURE
WHOLLY UNTAUGHT WITH FACULTIES QUITE TORPID THEY SEEMED TO ME
HOPELESSLY DULL AND AT FIRST SIGHT ALL DULL ALIKE BUT I SOON FOUND I
WAS MISTAKEN
THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE AMONGST THEM AS AMONGST THE
EDUCATED AND WHEN I GOT TO KNOW THEM AND THEY ME THIS DIFFERENCE
RAPIDLY DEVELOPED ITSELF
THEIR AMAZEMENT AT ME MY LANGUAGE MY RULES
AND WAYS ONCE SUBSIDED I FOUND SOME OF THESE HEAVY LOOKING GAPING
RUSTICS WAKE UP INTO SHARP WITTED GIRLS ENOUGH
MANY SHOWED THEMSELVES
OBLIGING AND AMIABLE TOO AND I DISCOVERED AMONGST THEM NOT A FEW
EXAMPLES OF NATURAL POLITENESS AND INNATE SELF RESPECT AS WELL AS OF
EXCELLENT CAPACITY THAT WON BOTH MY GOODWILL AND MY ADMIRATION
THESE
SOON TOOK A PLEASURE IN DOING THEIR WORK WELL IN KEEPING THEIR PERSONS
NEAT IN LEARNING THEIR TASKS REGULARLY IN ACQUIRING QUIET AND ORDERLY
MANNERS
THE RAPIDITY OF THEIR PROGRESS IN SOME INSTANCES WAS EVEN
SURPRISING AND AN HONEST AND HAPPY PRIDE I TOOK IN IT BESIDES I BEGAN
PERSONALLY TO LIKE SOME OF THE BEST GIRLS AND THEY LIKED ME
I HAD
AMONGST MY SCHOLARS SEVERAL FARMERS' DAUGHTERS YOUNG WOMEN GROWN
ALMOST
THESE COULD ALREADY READ WRITE AND SEW AND TO THEM I TAUGHT
THE ELEMENTS OF GRAMMAR GEOGRAPHY HISTORY AND THE FINER KINDS OF
NEEDLEWORK
I FOUND ESTIMABLE CHARACTERS AMONGST THEM CHARACTERS
DESIROUS OF INFORMATION AND DISPOSED FOR IMPROVEMENT WITH WHOM I PASSED
MANY A PLEASANT EVENING HOUR IN THEIR OWN HOMES
THEIR PARENTS THEN THE
FARMER AND HIS WIFE LOADED ME WITH ATTENTIONS
THERE WAS AN ENJOYMENT
IN ACCEPTING THEIR SIMPLE KINDNESS AND IN REPAYING IT BY A
CONSIDERATION A SCRUPULOUS REGARD TO THEIR FEELINGS TO WHICH THEY WERE
NOT PERHAPS AT ALL TIMES ACCUSTOMED AND WHICH BOTH CHARMED AND
BENEFITED THEM BECAUSE WHILE IT ELEVATED THEM IN THEIR OWN EYES IT
MADE THEM EMULOUS TO MERIT THE DEFERENTIAL TREATMENT THEY RECEIVED
I FELT I BECAME A FAVOURITE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
WHENEVER I WENT OUT I
HEARD ON ALL SIDES CORDIAL SALUTATIONS AND WAS WELCOMED WITH FRIENDLY
SMILES
TO LIVE AMIDST GENERAL REGARD THOUGH IT BE BUT THE REGARD OF
WORKING PEOPLE IS LIKE SITTING IN SUNSHINE CALM AND SWEET SERENE
INWARD FEELINGS BUD AND BLOOM UNDER THE RAY
AT THIS PERIOD OF MY LIFE
MY HEART FAR OFTENER SWELLED WITH THANKFULNESS THAN SANK WITH DEJECTION
AND YET READER TO TELL YOU ALL IN THE MIDST OF THIS CALM THIS USEFUL
EXISTENCE AFTER A DAY PASSED IN HONOURABLE EXERTION AMONGST MY SCHOLARS
AN EVENING SPENT IN DRAWING OR READING CONTENTEDLY ALONE I USED TO RUSH
INTO STRANGE DREAMS AT NIGHT DREAMS MANY COLOURED AGITATED FULL OF THE
IDEAL THE STIRRING THE STORMY DREAMS WHERE AMIDST UNUSUAL SCENES
CHARGED WITH ADVENTURE WITH AGITATING RISK AND ROMANTIC CHANCE I STILL
AGAIN AND AGAIN MET MR
ROCHESTER ALWAYS AT SOME EXCITING CRISIS AND
THEN THE SENSE OF BEING IN HIS ARMS HEARING HIS VOICE MEETING HIS EYE
TOUCHING HIS HAND AND CHEEK LOVING HIM BEING LOVED BY HIM THE HOPE OF
PASSING A LIFETIME AT HIS SIDE WOULD BE RENEWED WITH ALL ITS FIRST
FORCE AND FIRE
THEN I AWOKE
THEN I RECALLED WHERE I WAS AND HOW
SITUATED
THEN I ROSE UP ON MY CURTAINLESS BED TREMBLING AND QUIVERING
AND THEN THE STILL DARK NIGHT WITNESSED THE CONVULSION OF DESPAIR AND
HEARD THE BURST OF PASSION
BY NINE O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING I WAS
PUNCTUALLY OPENING THE SCHOOL TRANQUIL SETTLED PREPARED FOR THE STEADY
DUTIES OF THE DAY
ROSAMOND OLIVER KEPT HER WORD IN COMING TO VISIT ME
HER CALL AT THE
SCHOOL WAS GENERALLY MADE IN THE COURSE OF HER MORNING RIDE
SHE WOULD
CANTER UP TO THE DOOR ON HER PONY FOLLOWED BY A MOUNTED LIVERY SERVANT
ANYTHING MORE EXQUISITE THAN HER APPEARANCE IN HER PURPLE HABIT WITH
HER AMAZON'S CAP OF BLACK VELVET PLACED GRACEFULLY ABOVE THE LONG CURLS
THAT KISSED HER CHEEK AND FLOATED TO HER SHOULDERS CAN SCARCELY BE
IMAGINED AND IT WAS THUS SHE WOULD ENTER THE RUSTIC BUILDING AND GLIDE
THROUGH THE DAZZLED RANKS OF THE VILLAGE CHILDREN
SHE GENERALLY CAME AT
THE HOUR WHEN MR
RIVERS WAS ENGAGED IN GIVING HIS DAILY CATECHISING
LESSON
KEENLY I FEAR DID THE EYE OF THE VISITRESS PIERCE THE YOUNG
PASTOR'S HEART
A SORT OF INSTINCT SEEMED TO WARN HIM OF HER ENTRANCE
EVEN WHEN HE DID NOT SEE IT AND WHEN HE WAS LOOKING QUITE AWAY FROM THE
DOOR IF SHE APPEARED AT IT HIS CHEEK WOULD GLOW AND HIS MARBLE SEEMING
FEATURES THOUGH THEY REFUSED TO RELAX CHANGED INDESCRIBABLY AND IN
THEIR VERY QUIESCENCE BECAME EXPRESSIVE OF A REPRESSED FERVOUR STRONGER
THAN WORKING MUSCLE OR DARTING GLANCE COULD INDICATE
OF COURSE SHE KNEW HER POWER INDEED HE DID NOT BECAUSE HE COULD NOT
CONCEAL IT FROM HER
IN SPITE OF HIS CHRISTIAN STOICISM WHEN SHE WENT
UP AND ADDRESSED HIM AND SMILED GAILY ENCOURAGINGLY EVEN FONDLY IN HIS
FACE HIS HAND WOULD TREMBLE AND HIS EYE BURN
HE SEEMED TO SAY WITH
HIS SAD AND RESOLUTE LOOK IF HE DID NOT SAY IT WITH HIS LIPS I LOVE
YOU AND I KNOW YOU PREFER ME
IT IS NOT DESPAIR OF SUCCESS THAT KEEPS
ME DUMB
IF I OFFERED MY HEART I BELIEVE YOU WOULD ACCEPT IT
BUT THAT
HEART IS ALREADY LAID ON A SACRED ALTAR THE FIRE IS ARRANGED ROUND IT
IT WILL SOON BE NO MORE THAN A SACRIFICE CONSUMED
AND THEN SHE WOULD POUT LIKE A DISAPPOINTED CHILD A PENSIVE CLOUD WOULD
SOFTEN HER RADIANT VIVACITY SHE WOULD WITHDRAW HER HAND HASTILY FROM
HIS AND TURN IN TRANSIENT PETULANCE FROM HIS ASPECT AT ONCE SO HEROIC
AND SO MARTYR LIKE
ST
JOHN NO DOUBT WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE WORLD TO
FOLLOW RECALL RETAIN HER WHEN SHE THUS LEFT HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT GIVE
ONE CHANCE OF HEAVEN NOR RELINQUISH FOR THE ELYSIUM OF HER LOVE ONE
HOPE OF THE TRUE ETERNAL PARADISE
BESIDES HE COULD NOT BIND ALL THAT
HE HAD IN HIS NATURE THE ROVER THE ASPIRANT THE POET THE PRIEST IN
THE LIMITS OF A SINGLE PASSION
HE COULD NOT HE WOULD NOT RENOUNCE HIS
WILD FIELD OF MISSION WARFARE FOR THE PARLOURS AND THE PEACE OF VALE
HALL
I LEARNT SO MUCH FROM HIMSELF IN AN INROAD I ONCE DESPITE HIS
RESERVE HAD THE DARING TO MAKE ON HIS CONFIDENCE
MISS OLIVER ALREADY HONOURED ME WITH FREQUENT VISITS TO MY COTTAGE
I
HAD LEARNT HER WHOLE CHARACTER WHICH WAS WITHOUT MYSTERY OR DISGUISE
SHE WAS COQUETTISH BUT NOT HEARTLESS EXACTING BUT NOT WORTHLESSLY
SELFISH
SHE HAD BEEN INDULGED FROM HER BIRTH BUT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY
SPOILT
SHE WAS HASTY BUT GOOD HUMOURED VAIN SHE COULD NOT HELP IT
WHEN EVERY GLANCE IN THE GLASS SHOWED HER SUCH A FLUSH OF LOVELINESS
BUT NOT AFFECTED LIBERAL HANDED INNOCENT OF THE PRIDE OF WEALTH
INGENUOUS SUFFICIENTLY INTELLIGENT GAY LIVELY AND UNTHINKING SHE WAS
VERY CHARMING IN SHORT EVEN TO A COOL OBSERVER OF HER OWN SEX LIKE ME
BUT SHE WAS NOT PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING OR THOROUGHLY IMPRESSIVE
A VERY
DIFFERENT SORT OF MIND WAS HERS FROM THAT FOR INSTANCE OF THE SISTERS
OF ST
JOHN
STILL I LIKED HER ALMOST AS I LIKED MY PUPIL ADELE EXCEPT
THAT FOR A CHILD WHOM WE HAVE WATCHED OVER AND TAUGHT A CLOSER
AFFECTION IS ENGENDERED THAN WE CAN GIVE AN EQUALLY ATTRACTIVE ADULT
ACQUAINTANCE
SHE HAD TAKEN AN AMIABLE CAPRICE TO ME
SHE SAID I WAS LIKE MR
RIVERS
ONLY CERTAINLY SHE ALLOWED NOT ONE TENTH SO HANDSOME THOUGH I WAS A
NICE NEAT LITTLE SOUL ENOUGH BUT HE WAS AN ANGEL I WAS HOWEVER
GOOD CLEVER COMPOSED AND FIRM LIKE HIM
I WAS A LUSUS NATURAE SHE
AFFIRMED AS A VILLAGE SCHOOLMISTRESS SHE WAS SURE MY PREVIOUS HISTORY
IF KNOWN WOULD MAKE A DELIGHTFUL ROMANCE
ONE EVENING WHILE WITH HER USUAL CHILD LIKE ACTIVITY AND THOUGHTLESS
YET NOT OFFENSIVE INQUISITIVENESS SHE WAS RUMMAGING THE CUPBOARD AND THE
TABLE DRAWER OF MY LITTLE KITCHEN SHE DISCOVERED FIRST TWO FRENCH BOOKS
A VOLUME OF SCHILLER A GERMAN GRAMMAR AND DICTIONARY AND THEN MY
DRAWING MATERIALS AND SOME SKETCHES INCLUDING A PENCIL HEAD OF A PRETTY
LITTLE CHERUB LIKE GIRL ONE OF MY SCHOLARS AND SUNDRY VIEWS FROM
NATURE TAKEN IN THE VALE OF MORTON AND ON THE SURROUNDING MOORS
SHE
WAS FIRST TRANSFIXED WITH SURPRISE AND THEN ELECTRIFIED WITH DELIGHT
HAD I DONE THESE PICTURES DID I KNOW FRENCH AND GERMAN WHAT A
LOVE WHAT A MIRACLE I WAS I DREW BETTER THAN HER MASTER IN THE FIRST
SCHOOL IN S
WOULD I SKETCH A PORTRAIT OF HER TO SHOW TO PAPA
WITH PLEASURE I REPLIED AND I FELT A THRILL OF ARTIST DELIGHT AT THE
IDEA OF COPYING FROM SO PERFECT AND RADIANT A MODEL
SHE HAD THEN ON A
DARK BLUE SILK DRESS HER ARMS AND HER NECK WERE BARE HER ONLY ORNAMENT
WAS HER CHESTNUT TRESSES WHICH WAVED OVER HER SHOULDERS WITH ALL THE
WILD GRACE OF NATURAL CURLS
I TOOK A SHEET OF FINE CARD BOARD AND DREW
A CAREFUL OUTLINE
I PROMISED MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF COLOURING IT AND
AS IT WAS GETTING LATE THEN I TOLD HER SHE MUST COME AND SIT ANOTHER
DAY
SHE MADE SUCH A REPORT OF ME TO HER FATHER THAT MR
OLIVER HIMSELF
ACCOMPANIED HER NEXT EVENING A TALL MASSIVE FEATURED MIDDLE AGED AND
GREY HEADED MAN AT WHOSE SIDE HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER LOOKED LIKE A BRIGHT
FLOWER NEAR A HOARY TURRET
HE APPEARED A TACITURN AND PERHAPS A PROUD
PERSONAGE BUT HE WAS VERY KIND TO ME
THE SKETCH OF ROSAMOND'S PORTRAIT
PLEASED HIM HIGHLY HE SAID I MUST MAKE A FINISHED PICTURE OF IT
HE
INSISTED TOO ON MY COMING THE NEXT DAY TO SPEND THE EVENING AT VALE
HALL
I WENT
I FOUND IT A LARGE HANDSOME RESIDENCE SHOWING ABUNDANT
EVIDENCES OF WEALTH IN THE PROPRIETOR
ROSAMOND WAS FULL OF GLEE AND
PLEASURE ALL THE TIME I STAYED
HER FATHER WAS AFFABLE AND WHEN HE
ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH ME AFTER TEA HE EXPRESSED IN STRONG TERMS
HIS APPROBATION OF WHAT I HAD DONE IN MORTON SCHOOL AND SAID HE ONLY
FEARED FROM WHAT HE SAW AND HEARD I WAS TOO GOOD FOR THE PLACE AND
WOULD SOON QUIT IT FOR ONE MORE SUITABLE
INDEED CRIED ROSAMOND SHE IS CLEVER ENOUGH TO BE A GOVERNESS IN A
HIGH FAMILY PAPA
I THOUGHT I WOULD FAR RATHER BE WHERE I AM THAN IN ANY HIGH FAMILY IN THE
LAND
MR
OLIVER SPOKE OF MR
RIVERS OF THE RIVERS FAMILY WITH GREAT
RESPECT
HE SAID IT WAS A VERY OLD NAME IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT THE
ANCESTORS OF THE HOUSE WERE WEALTHY THAT ALL MORTON HAD ONCE BELONGED TO
THEM THAT EVEN NOW HE CONSIDERED THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT HOUSE MIGHT
IF HE LIKED MAKE AN ALLIANCE WITH THE BEST
HE ACCOUNTED IT A PITY THAT
SO FINE AND TALENTED A YOUNG MAN SHOULD HAVE FORMED THE DESIGN OF GOING
OUT AS A MISSIONARY IT WAS QUITE THROWING A VALUABLE LIFE AWAY
IT
APPEARED THEN THAT HER FATHER WOULD THROW NO OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF
ROSAMOND'S UNION WITH ST
JOHN
MR
OLIVER EVIDENTLY REGARDED THE YOUNG
CLERGYMAN'S GOOD BIRTH OLD NAME AND SACRED PROFESSION AS SUFFICIENT
COMPENSATION FOR THE WANT OF FORTUNE
IT WAS THE 5TH OF NOVEMBER AND A HOLIDAY
MY LITTLE SERVANT AFTER
HELPING ME TO CLEAN MY HOUSE WAS GONE WELL SATISFIED WITH THE FEE OF A
PENNY FOR HER AID
ALL ABOUT ME WAS SPOTLESS AND BRIGHT SCOURED FLOOR
POLISHED GRATE AND WELL RUBBED CHAIRS
I HAD ALSO MADE MYSELF NEAT AND
HAD NOW THE AFTERNOON BEFORE ME TO SPEND AS I WOULD
THE TRANSLATION OF A FEW PAGES OF GERMAN OCCUPIED AN HOUR THEN I GOT MY
PALETTE AND PENCILS AND FELL TO THE MORE SOOTHING BECAUSE EASIER
OCCUPATION OF COMPLETING ROSAMOND OLIVER'S MINIATURE
THE HEAD WAS
FINISHED ALREADY THERE WAS BUT THE BACKGROUND TO TINT AND THE DRAPERY TO
SHADE OFF A TOUCH OF CARMINE TOO TO ADD TO THE RIPE LIPS A SOFT CURL
HERE AND THERE TO THE TRESSES A DEEPER TINGE TO THE SHADOW OF THE LASH
UNDER THE AZURED EYELID
I WAS ABSORBED IN THE EXECUTION OF THESE NICE
DETAILS WHEN AFTER ONE RAPID TAP MY DOOR UNCLOSED ADMITTING ST
JOHN
RIVERS
I AM COME TO SEE HOW YOU ARE SPENDING YOUR HOLIDAY HE SAID
NOT I
HOPE IN THOUGHT NO THAT IS WELL WHILE YOU DRAW YOU WILL NOT FEEL
LONELY
YOU SEE I MISTRUST YOU STILL THOUGH YOU HAVE BORNE UP
WONDERFULLY SO FAR
I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A BOOK FOR EVENING SOLACE AND
HE LAID ON THE TABLE A NEW PUBLICATION A POEM ONE OF THOSE GENUINE
PRODUCTIONS SO OFTEN VOUCHSAFED TO THE FORTUNATE PUBLIC OF THOSE DAYS THE
GOLDEN AGE OF MODERN LITERATURE
ALAS THE READERS OF OUR ERA ARE LESS
FAVOURED
BUT COURAGE I WILL NOT PAUSE EITHER TO ACCUSE OR REPINE
I
KNOW POETRY IS NOT DEAD NOR GENIUS LOST NOR HAS MAMMON GAINED POWER
OVER EITHER TO BIND OR SLAY THEY WILL BOTH ASSERT THEIR EXISTENCE
THEIR PRESENCE THEIR LIBERTY AND STRENGTH AGAIN ONE DAY
POWERFUL
ANGELS SAFE IN HEAVEN THEY SMILE WHEN SORDID SOULS TRIUMPH AND FEEBLE
ONES WEEP OVER THEIR DESTRUCTION
POETRY DESTROYED GENIUS BANISHED
NO MEDIOCRITY NO DO NOT LET ENVY PROMPT YOU TO THE THOUGHT
NO THEY
NOT ONLY LIVE BUT REIGN AND REDEEM AND WITHOUT THEIR DIVINE INFLUENCE
SPREAD EVERYWHERE YOU WOULD BE IN HELL THE HELL OF YOUR OWN MEANNESS
WHILE I WAS EAGERLY GLANCING AT THE BRIGHT PAGES OF MARMION FOR
MARMION IT WAS ST
JOHN STOOPED TO EXAMINE MY DRAWING
HIS TALL
FIGURE SPRANG ERECT AGAIN WITH A START HE SAID NOTHING
I LOOKED UP AT
HIM HE SHUNNED MY EYE
I KNEW HIS THOUGHTS WELL AND COULD READ HIS
HEART PLAINLY AT THE MOMENT I FELT CALMER AND COOLER THAN HE I HAD THEN
TEMPORARILY THE ADVANTAGE OF HIM AND I CONCEIVED AN INCLINATION TO DO
HIM SOME GOOD IF I COULD
WITH ALL HIS FIRMNESS AND SELF CONTROL THOUGHT I HE TASKS HIMSELF
TOO FAR LOCKS EVERY FEELING AND PANG WITHIN EXPRESSES CONFESSES
IMPARTS NOTHING
I AM SURE IT WOULD BENEFIT HIM TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT
THIS SWEET ROSAMOND WHOM HE THINKS HE OUGHT NOT TO MARRY I WILL MAKE
HIM TALK
I SAID FIRST TAKE A CHAIR MR
RIVERS BUT HE ANSWERED AS HE ALWAYS
DID THAT HE COULD NOT STAY
VERY WELL I RESPONDED MENTALLY STAND
IF YOU LIKE BUT YOU SHALL NOT GO JUST YET I AM DETERMINED SOLITUDE IS
AT LEAST AS BAD FOR YOU AS IT IS FOR ME
I'LL TRY IF I CANNOT DISCOVER
THE SECRET SPRING OF YOUR CONFIDENCE AND FIND AN APERTURE IN THAT MARBLE
BREAST THROUGH WHICH I CAN SHED ONE DROP OF THE BALM OF SYMPATHY
IS THIS PORTRAIT LIKE I ASKED BLUNTLY
LIKE LIKE WHOM I DID NOT OBSERVE IT CLOSELY
YOU DID MR
RIVERS
HE ALMOST STARTED AT MY SUDDEN AND STRANGE ABRUPTNESS HE LOOKED AT ME
ASTONISHED
OH THAT IS NOTHING YET I MUTTERED WITHIN
I DON'T MEAN
TO BE BAFFLED BY A LITTLE STIFFNESS ON YOUR PART I'M PREPARED TO GO TO
CONSIDERABLE LENGTHS I CONTINUED YOU OBSERVED IT CLOSELY AND
DISTINCTLY BUT I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO YOUR LOOKING AT IT AGAIN AND I
ROSE AND PLACED IT IN HIS HAND
A WELL EXECUTED PICTURE HE SAID VERY SOFT CLEAR COLOURING VERY
GRACEFUL AND CORRECT DRAWING
YES YES I KNOW ALL THAT
BUT WHAT OF THE RESEMBLANCE WHO IS IT
LIKE
MASTERING SOME HESITATION HE ANSWERED MISS OLIVER I PRESUME
OF COURSE
AND NOW SIR TO REWARD YOU FOR THE ACCURATE GUESS I WILL
PROMISE TO PAINT YOU A CAREFUL AND FAITHFUL DUPLICATE OF THIS VERY
PICTURE PROVIDED YOU ADMIT THAT THE GIFT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO YOU
I
DON'T WISH TO THROW AWAY MY TIME AND TROUBLE ON AN OFFERING YOU WOULD
DEEM WORTHLESS
HE CONTINUED TO GAZE AT THE PICTURE THE LONGER HE LOOKED THE FIRMER HE
HELD IT THE MORE HE SEEMED TO COVET IT
IT IS LIKE HE MURMURED THE
EYE IS WELL MANAGED THE COLOUR LIGHT EXPRESSION ARE PERFECT
IT
SMILES
WOULD IT COMFORT OR WOULD IT WOUND YOU TO HAVE A SIMILAR PAINTING TELL
ME THAT
WHEN YOU ARE AT MADAGASCAR OR AT THE CAPE OR IN INDIA WOULD
IT BE A CONSOLATION TO HAVE THAT MEMENTO IN YOUR POSSESSION OR WOULD THE
SIGHT OF IT BRING RECOLLECTIONS CALCULATED TO ENERVATE AND DISTRESS
HE NOW FURTIVELY RAISED HIS EYES HE GLANCED AT ME IRRESOLUTE
DISTURBED HE AGAIN SURVEYED THE PICTURE
THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT IS CERTAIN WHETHER IT WOULD BE JUDICIOUS
OR WISE IS ANOTHER QUESTION
SINCE I HAD ASCERTAINED THAT ROSAMOND REALLY PREFERRED HIM AND THAT HER
FATHER WAS NOT LIKELY TO OPPOSE THE MATCH I LESS EXALTED IN MY VIEWS
THAN ST
JOHN HAD BEEN STRONGLY DISPOSED IN MY OWN HEART TO ADVOCATE
THEIR UNION
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHOULD HE BECOME THE POSSESSOR OF MR
OLIVER'S LARGE FORTUNE HE MIGHT DO AS MUCH GOOD WITH IT AS IF HE WENT
AND LAID HIS GENIUS OUT TO WITHER AND HIS STRENGTH TO WASTE UNDER A
TROPICAL SUN
WITH THIS PERSUASION I NOW ANSWERED
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IT WOULD BE WISER AND MORE JUDICIOUS IF YOU WERE TO
TAKE TO YOURSELF THE ORIGINAL AT ONCE
BY THIS TIME HE HAD SAT DOWN HE HAD LAID THE PICTURE ON THE TABLE BEFORE
HIM AND WITH HIS BROW SUPPORTED ON BOTH HANDS HUNG FONDLY OVER IT
I
DISCERNED HE WAS NOW NEITHER ANGRY NOR SHOCKED AT MY AUDACITY
I SAW
EVEN THAT TO BE THUS FRANKLY ADDRESSED ON A SUBJECT HE HAD DEEMED
UNAPPROACHABLE TO HEAR IT THUS FREELY HANDLED WAS BEGINNING TO BE FELT
BY HIM AS A NEW PLEASURE AN UNHOPED FOR RELIEF
RESERVED PEOPLE OFTEN
REALLY NEED THE FRANK DISCUSSION OF THEIR SENTIMENTS AND GRIEFS MORE THAN
THE EXPANSIVE
THE STERNEST SEEMING STOIC IS HUMAN AFTER ALL AND TO
BURST WITH BOLDNESS AND GOOD WILL INTO THE SILENT SEA OF THEIR SOULS
IS OFTEN TO CONFER ON THEM THE FIRST OF OBLIGATIONS
SHE LIKES YOU I AM SURE SAID I AS I STOOD BEHIND HIS CHAIR AND HER
FATHER RESPECTS YOU
MOREOVER SHE IS A SWEET GIRL RATHER THOUGHTLESS
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT THOUGHT FOR BOTH YOURSELF AND HER
YOU
OUGHT TO MARRY HER
DOES SHE LIKE ME HE ASKED
CERTAINLY BETTER THAN SHE LIKES ANY ONE ELSE
SHE TALKS OF YOU
CONTINUALLY THERE IS NO SUBJECT SHE ENJOYS SO MUCH OR TOUCHES UPON SO
OFTEN
IT IS VERY PLEASANT TO HEAR THIS HE SAID VERY GO ON FOR ANOTHER
QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND HE ACTUALLY TOOK OUT HIS WATCH AND LAID IT UPON
THE TABLE TO MEASURE THE TIME
BUT WHERE IS THE USE OF GOING ON I ASKED WHEN YOU ARE PROBABLY
PREPARING SOME IRON BLOW OF CONTRADICTION OR FORGING A FRESH CHAIN TO
FETTER YOUR HEART
DON'T IMAGINE SUCH HARD THINGS
FANCY ME YIELDING AND MELTING AS I AM
DOING HUMAN LOVE RISING LIKE A FRESHLY OPENED FOUNTAIN IN MY MIND AND
OVERFLOWING WITH SWEET INUNDATION ALL THE FIELD I HAVE SO CAREFULLY AND
WITH SUCH LABOUR PREPARED SO ASSIDUOUSLY SOWN WITH THE SEEDS OF GOOD
INTENTIONS OF SELF DENYING PLANS
AND NOW IT IS DELUGED WITH A
NECTAROUS FLOOD THE YOUNG GERMS SWAMPED DELICIOUS POISON CANKERING
THEM NOW I SEE MYSELF STRETCHED ON AN OTTOMAN IN THE DRAWING ROOM AT
VALE HALL AT MY BRIDE ROSAMOND OLIVER'S FEET SHE IS TALKING TO ME WITH
HER SWEET VOICE GAZING DOWN ON ME WITH THOSE EYES YOUR SKILFUL HAND HAS
COPIED SO WELL SMILING AT ME WITH THESE CORAL LIPS
SHE IS MINE I AM
HERS THIS PRESENT LIFE AND PASSING WORLD SUFFICE TO ME
HUSH SAY
NOTHING MY HEART IS FULL OF DELIGHT MY SENSES ARE ENTRANCED LET THE
TIME I MARKED PASS IN PEACE
I HUMOURED HIM THE WATCH TICKED ON HE BREATHED FAST AND LOW I STOOD
SILENT
AMIDST THIS HUSH THE QUARTET SPED HE REPLACED THE WATCH LAID
THE PICTURE DOWN ROSE AND STOOD ON THE HEARTH
NOW SAID HE THAT LITTLE SPACE WAS GIVEN TO DELIRIUM AND DELUSION
I
RESTED MY TEMPLES ON THE BREAST OF TEMPTATION AND PUT MY NECK
VOLUNTARILY UNDER HER YOKE OF FLOWERS
I TASTED HER CUP
THE PILLOW WAS
BURNING THERE IS AN ASP IN THE GARLAND THE WINE HAS A BITTER TASTE HER
PROMISES ARE HOLLOW HER OFFERS FALSE I SEE AND KNOW ALL THIS
I GAZED AT HIM IN WONDER
IT IS STRANGE PURSUED HE THAT WHILE I LOVE ROSAMOND OLIVER SO
WILDLY WITH ALL THE INTENSITY INDEED OF A FIRST PASSION THE OBJECT OF
WHICH IS EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL GRACEFUL FASCINATING I EXPERIENCE AT
THE SAME TIME A CALM UNWARPED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE WOULD NOT MAKE ME A
GOOD WIFE THAT SHE IS NOT THE PARTNER SUITED TO ME THAT I SHOULD
DISCOVER THIS WITHIN A YEAR AFTER MARRIAGE AND THAT TO TWELVE MONTHS'
RAPTURE WOULD SUCCEED A LIFETIME OF REGRET
THIS I KNOW
STRANGE INDEED I COULD NOT HELP EJACULATING
WHILE SOMETHING IN ME HE WENT ON IS ACUTELY SENSIBLE TO HER CHARMS
SOMETHING ELSE IS AS DEEPLY IMPRESSED WITH HER DEFECTS THEY ARE SUCH
THAT SHE COULD SYMPATHISE IN NOTHING I ASPIRED TO CO OPERATE IN NOTHING
I UNDERTOOK
ROSAMOND A SUFFERER A LABOURER A FEMALE APOSTLE ROSAMOND
A MISSIONARY'S WIFE NO
BUT YOU NEED NOT BE A MISSIONARY
YOU MIGHT RELINQUISH THAT SCHEME
RELINQUISH WHAT MY VOCATION MY GREAT WORK MY FOUNDATION LAID ON
EARTH FOR A MANSION IN HEAVEN MY HOPES OF BEING NUMBERED IN THE BAND
WHO HAVE MERGED ALL AMBITIONS IN THE GLORIOUS ONE OF BETTERING THEIR
RACE OF CARRYING KNOWLEDGE INTO THE REALMS OF IGNORANCE OF SUBSTITUTING
PEACE FOR WAR FREEDOM FOR BONDAGE RELIGION FOR SUPERSTITION THE HOPE
OF HEAVEN FOR THE FEAR OF HELL MUST I RELINQUISH THAT IT IS DEARER
THAN THE BLOOD IN MY VEINS
IT IS WHAT I HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO AND TO
LIVE FOR
AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE I SAID AND MISS OLIVER ARE HER
DISAPPOINTMENT AND SORROW OF NO INTEREST TO YOU
MISS OLIVER IS EVER SURROUNDED BY SUITORS AND FLATTERERS IN LESS THAN A
MONTH MY IMAGE WILL BE EFFACED FROM HER HEART
SHE WILL FORGET ME AND
WILL MARRY PROBABLY SOME ONE WHO WILL MAKE HER FAR HAPPIER THAN I
SHOULD DO
YOU SPEAK COOLLY ENOUGH BUT YOU SUFFER IN THE CONFLICT
YOU ARE
WASTING AWAY
NO
IF I GET A LITTLE THIN IT IS WITH ANXIETY ABOUT MY PROSPECTS YET
UNSETTLED MY DEPARTURE CONTINUALLY PROCRASTINATED
ONLY THIS MORNING
I RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE THAT THE SUCCESSOR WHOSE ARRIVAL I HAVE BEEN SO
LONG EXPECTING CANNOT BE READY TO REPLACE ME FOR THREE MONTHS TO COME
YET AND PERHAPS THE THREE MONTHS MAY EXTEND TO SIX
YOU TREMBLE AND BECOME FLUSHED WHENEVER MISS OLIVER ENTERS THE
SCHOOLROOM
AGAIN THE SURPRISED EXPRESSION CROSSED HIS FACE
HE HAD NOT IMAGINED
THAT A WOMAN WOULD DARE TO SPEAK SO TO A MAN
FOR ME I FELT AT HOME IN
THIS SORT OF DISCOURSE
I COULD NEVER REST IN COMMUNICATION WITH STRONG
DISCREET AND REFINED MINDS WHETHER MALE OR FEMALE TILL I HAD PASSED
THE OUTWORKS OF CONVENTIONAL RESERVE AND CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF
CONFIDENCE AND WON A PLACE BY THEIR HEART'S VERY HEARTHSTONE
YOU ARE ORIGINAL SAID HE AND NOT TIMID
THERE IS SOMETHING BRAVE IN
YOUR SPIRIT AS WELL AS PENETRATING IN YOUR EYE BUT ALLOW ME TO ASSURE
YOU THAT YOU PARTIALLY MISINTERPRET MY EMOTIONS
YOU THINK THEM MORE
PROFOUND AND POTENT THAN THEY ARE
YOU GIVE ME A LARGER ALLOWANCE OF
SYMPATHY THAN I HAVE A JUST CLAIM TO
WHEN I COLOUR AND WHEN I SHADE
BEFORE MISS OLIVER I DO NOT PITY MYSELF
I SCORN THE WEAKNESS
I KNOW
IT IS IGNOBLE A MERE FEVER OF THE FLESH NOT I DECLARE THE CONVULSION
OF THE SOUL
THAT IS JUST AS FIXED AS A ROCK FIRM SET IN THE DEPTHS
OF A RESTLESS SEA
KNOW ME TO BE WHAT I AM A COLD HARD MAN
I SMILED INCREDULOUSLY
YOU HAVE TAKEN MY CONFIDENCE BY STORM HE CONTINUED AND NOW IT IS
MUCH AT YOUR SERVICE
I AM SIMPLY IN MY ORIGINAL STATE STRIPPED OF
THAT BLOOD BLEACHED ROBE WITH WHICH CHRISTIANITY COVERS HUMAN DEFORMITY A
COLD HARD AMBITIOUS MAN
NATURAL AFFECTION ONLY OF ALL THE
SENTIMENTS HAS PERMANENT POWER OVER ME
REASON AND NOT FEELING IS MY
GUIDE MY AMBITION IS UNLIMITED MY DESIRE TO RISE HIGHER TO DO MORE
THAN OTHERS INSATIABLE
I HONOUR ENDURANCE PERSEVERANCE INDUSTRY
TALENT BECAUSE THESE ARE THE MEANS BY WHICH MEN ACHIEVE GREAT ENDS AND
MOUNT TO LOFTY EMINENCE
I WATCH YOUR CAREER WITH INTEREST BECAUSE I
CONSIDER YOU A SPECIMEN OF A DILIGENT ORDERLY ENERGETIC WOMAN NOT
BECAUSE I DEEPLY COMPASSIONATE WHAT YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH OR WHAT YOU
STILL SUFFER
YOU WOULD DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS A MERE PAGAN PHILOSOPHER I SAID
NO
THERE IS THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND DEISTIC PHILOSOPHERS I
BELIEVE AND I BELIEVE THE GOSPEL
YOU MISSED YOUR EPITHET
I AM NOT A
PAGAN BUT A CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHER A FOLLOWER OF THE SECT OF JESUS
AS
HIS DISCIPLE I ADOPT HIS PURE HIS MERCIFUL HIS BENIGNANT DOCTRINES
I
ADVOCATE THEM I AM SWORN TO SPREAD THEM
WON IN YOUTH TO RELIGION SHE
HAS CULTIVATED MY ORIGINAL QUALITIES THUS FROM THE MINUTE GERM NATURAL
AFFECTION SHE HAS DEVELOPED THE OVERSHADOWING TREE PHILANTHROPY
FROM
THE WILD STRINGY ROOT OF HUMAN UPRIGHTNESS SHE HAS REARED A DUE SENSE OF
THE DIVINE JUSTICE
OF THE AMBITION TO WIN POWER AND RENOWN FOR MY
WRETCHED SELF SHE HAS FORMED THE AMBITION TO SPREAD MY MASTER'S KINGDOM
TO ACHIEVE VICTORIES FOR THE STANDARD OF THE CROSS
SO MUCH HAS RELIGION
DONE FOR ME TURNING THE ORIGINAL MATERIALS TO THE BEST ACCOUNT PRUNING
AND TRAINING NATURE
BUT SHE COULD NOT ERADICATE NATURE NOR WILL IT BE
ERADICATED 'TILL THIS MORTAL SHALL PUT ON IMMORTALITY
HAVING SAID THIS HE TOOK HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE BESIDE MY
PALETTE
ONCE MORE HE LOOKED AT THE PORTRAIT
SHE IS LOVELY HE MURMURED
SHE IS WELL NAMED THE ROSE OF THE
WORLD INDEED
AND MAY I NOT PAINT ONE LIKE IT FOR YOU
CUI BONO NO
HE DREW OVER THE PICTURE THE SHEET OF THIN PAPER ON WHICH I WAS
ACCUSTOMED TO REST MY HAND IN PAINTING TO PREVENT THE CARDBOARD FROM
BEING SULLIED
WHAT HE SUDDENLY SAW ON THIS BLANK PAPER IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL BUT SOMETHING HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE
HE TOOK IT
UP WITH A SNATCH HE LOOKED AT THE EDGE THEN SHOT A GLANCE AT ME
INEXPRESSIBLY PECULIAR AND QUITE INCOMPREHENSIBLE A GLANCE THAT SEEMED
TO TAKE AND MAKE NOTE OF EVERY POINT IN MY SHAPE FACE AND DRESS FOR IT
TRAVERSED ALL QUICK KEEN AS LIGHTNING
HIS LIPS PARTED AS IF TO
SPEAK BUT HE CHECKED THE COMING SENTENCE WHATEVER IT WAS
WHAT IS THE MATTER I ASKED
NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS THE REPLY AND REPLACING THE PAPER I SAW
HIM DEXTEROUSLY TEAR A NARROW SLIP FROM THE MARGIN
IT DISAPPEARED IN
HIS GLOVE AND WITH ONE HASTY NOD AND GOOD AFTERNOON HE VANISHED
WELL I EXCLAIMED USING AN EXPRESSION OF THE DISTRICT THAT CAPS THE
GLOBE HOWEVER
I IN MY TURN SCRUTINISED THE PAPER BUT SAW NOTHING ON IT SAVE A FEW
DINGY STAINS OF PAINT WHERE I HAD TRIED THE TINT IN MY PENCIL
I
PONDERED THE MYSTERY A MINUTE OR TWO BUT FINDING IT INSOLVABLE AND
BEING CERTAIN IT COULD NOT BE OF MUCH MOMENT I DISMISSED AND SOON
FORGOT IT
CHAPTER XXXIII
WHEN MR
ST
JOHN WENT IT WAS BEGINNING TO SNOW THE WHIRLING STORM
CONTINUED ALL NIGHT
THE NEXT DAY A KEEN WIND BROUGHT FRESH AND BLINDING
FALLS BY TWILIGHT THE VALLEY WAS DRIFTED UP AND ALMOST IMPASSABLE
I
HAD CLOSED MY SHUTTER LAID A MAT TO THE DOOR TO PREVENT THE SNOW FROM
BLOWING IN UNDER IT TRIMMED MY FIRE AND AFTER SITTING NEARLY AN HOUR ON
THE HEARTH LISTENING TO THE MUFFLED FURY OF THE TEMPEST I LIT A CANDLE
TOOK DOWN MARMION AND BEGINNING
DAY SET ON NORHAM'S CASTLED STEEP
AND TWEED'S FAIR RIVER BROAD AND DEEP
AND CHEVIOT'S MOUNTAINS LONE
THE MASSIVE TOWERS THE DONJON KEEP
THE FLANKING WALLS THAT ROUND THEM SWEEP
IN YELLOW LUSTRE SHONE
I SOON FORGOT STORM IN MUSIC
I HEARD A NOISE THE WIND I THOUGHT SHOOK THE DOOR
NO IT WAS ST
JOHN RIVERS WHO LIFTING THE LATCH CAME IN OUT OF THE FROZEN
HURRICANE THE HOWLING DARKNESS AND STOOD BEFORE ME THE CLOAK THAT
COVERED HIS TALL FIGURE ALL WHITE AS A GLACIER
I WAS ALMOST IN
CONSTERNATION SO LITTLE HAD I EXPECTED ANY GUEST FROM THE BLOCKED UP
VALE THAT NIGHT
ANY ILL NEWS I DEMANDED
HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED
NO
HOW VERY EASILY ALARMED YOU ARE HE ANSWERED REMOVING HIS CLOAK
AND HANGING IT UP AGAINST THE DOOR TOWARDS WHICH HE AGAIN COOLLY PUSHED
THE MAT WHICH HIS ENTRANCE HAD DERANGED
HE STAMPED THE SNOW FROM HIS
BOOTS
I SHALL SULLY THE PURITY OF YOUR FLOOR SAID HE BUT YOU MUST EXCUSE
ME FOR ONCE THEN HE APPROACHED THE FIRE
I HAVE HAD HARD WORK TO GET
HERE I ASSURE YOU HE OBSERVED AS HE WARMED HIS HANDS OVER THE FLAME
ONE DRIFT TOOK ME UP TO THE WAIST HAPPILY THE SNOW IS QUITE SOFT YET
BUT WHY ARE YOU COME I COULD NOT FORBEAR SAYING
RATHER AN INHOSPITABLE QUESTION TO PUT TO A VISITOR BUT SINCE YOU ASK
IT I ANSWER SIMPLY TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK WITH YOU I GOT TIRED OF MY
MUTE BOOKS AND EMPTY ROOMS
BESIDES SINCE YESTERDAY I HAVE EXPERIENCED
THE EXCITEMENT OF A PERSON TO WHOM A TALE HAS BEEN HALF TOLD AND WHO IS
IMPATIENT TO HEAR THE SEQUEL
HE SAT DOWN
I RECALLED HIS SINGULAR CONDUCT OF YESTERDAY AND REALLY I
BEGAN TO FEAR HIS WITS WERE TOUCHED
IF HE WERE INSANE HOWEVER HIS WAS
A VERY COOL AND COLLECTED INSANITY I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT
HANDSOME FEATURED FACE OF HIS LOOK MORE LIKE CHISELLED MARBLE THAN IT DID
JUST NOW AS HE PUT ASIDE HIS SNOW WET HAIR FROM HIS FOREHEAD AND LET THE
FIRELIGHT SHINE FREE ON HIS PALE BROW AND CHEEK AS PALE WHERE IT GRIEVED
ME TO DISCOVER THE HOLLOW TRACE OF CARE OR SORROW NOW SO PLAINLY GRAVED
I WAITED EXPECTING HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING I COULD AT LEAST COMPREHEND
BUT HIS HAND WAS NOW AT HIS CHIN HIS FINGER ON HIS LIP HE WAS THINKING
IT STRUCK ME THAT HIS HAND LOOKED WASTED LIKE HIS FACE
A PERHAPS
UNCALLED FOR GUSH OF PITY CAME OVER MY HEART I WAS MOVED TO SAY
I WISH DIANA OR MARY WOULD COME AND LIVE WITH YOU IT IS TOO BAD THAT
YOU SHOULD BE QUITE ALONE AND YOU ARE RECKLESSLY RASH ABOUT YOUR OWN
HEALTH
NOT AT ALL SAID HE I CARE FOR MYSELF WHEN NECESSARY
I AM WELL NOW
WHAT DO YOU SEE AMISS IN ME
THIS WAS SAID WITH A CARELESS ABSTRACTED INDIFFERENCE WHICH SHOWED THAT
MY SOLICITUDE WAS AT LEAST IN HIS OPINION WHOLLY SUPERFLUOUS
I WAS
SILENCED
HE STILL SLOWLY MOVED HIS FINGER OVER HIS UPPER LIP AND STILL HIS EYE
DWELT DREAMILY ON THE GLOWING GRATE THINKING IT URGENT TO SAY SOMETHING
I ASKED HIM PRESENTLY IF HE FELT ANY COLD DRAUGHT FROM THE DOOR WHICH
WAS BEHIND HIM
NO NO HE RESPONDED SHORTLY AND SOMEWHAT TESTILY
WELL I REFLECTED IF YOU WON'T TALK YOU MAY BE STILL I'LL LET YOU
ALONE NOW AND RETURN TO MY BOOK
SO I SNUFFED THE CANDLE AND RESUMED THE PERUSAL OF MARMION HE SOON
STIRRED MY EYE WAS INSTANTLY DRAWN TO HIS MOVEMENTS HE ONLY TOOK OUT A
MOROCCO POCKET BOOK THENCE PRODUCED A LETTER WHICH HE READ IN SILENCE
FOLDED IT PUT IT BACK RELAPSED INTO MEDITATION
IT WAS VAIN TO TRY TO
READ WITH SUCH AN INSCRUTABLE FIXTURE BEFORE ME NOR COULD I IN
IMPATIENCE CONSENT TO BE DUMB HE MIGHT REBUFF ME IF HE LIKED BUT TALK
I WOULD
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM DIANA AND MARY LATELY
NOT SINCE THE LETTER I SHOWED YOU A WEEK AGO
THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY CHANGE MADE ABOUT YOUR OWN ARRANGEMENTS YOU
WILL NOT BE SUMMONED TO LEAVE ENGLAND SOONER THAN YOU EXPECTED
I FEAR NOT INDEED SUCH CHANCE IS TOO GOOD TO BEFALL ME BAFFLED SO
FAR I CHANGED MY GROUND
I BETHOUGHT MYSELF TO TALK ABOUT THE SCHOOL
AND MY SCHOLARS
MARY GARRETT'S MOTHER IS BETTER AND MARY CAME BACK TO THE SCHOOL THIS
MORNING AND I SHALL HAVE FOUR NEW GIRLS NEXT WEEK FROM THE FOUNDRY
CLOSE THEY WOULD HAVE COME TO DAY BUT FOR THE SNOW
INDEED
MR
OLIVER PAYS FOR TWO
DOES HE
HE MEANS TO GIVE THE WHOLE SCHOOL A TREAT AT CHRISTMAS
I KNOW
WAS IT YOUR SUGGESTION
NO
WHOSE THEN
HIS DAUGHTER'S I THINK
IT IS LIKE HER SHE IS SO GOOD NATURED
YES
AGAIN CAME THE BLANK OF A PAUSE THE CLOCK STRUCK EIGHT STROKES
IT
AROUSED HIM HE UNCROSSED HIS LEGS SAT ERECT TURNED TO ME
LEAVE YOUR BOOK A MOMENT AND COME A LITTLE NEARER THE FIRE HE SAID
WONDERING AND OF MY WONDER FINDING NO END I COMPLIED
HALF AN HOUR AGO HE PURSUED I SPOKE OF MY IMPATIENCE TO HEAR THE
SEQUEL OF A TALE ON REFLECTION I FIND THE MATTER WILL BE BETTER MANAGED
BY MY ASSUMING THE NARRATOR'S PART AND CONVERTING YOU INTO A LISTENER
BEFORE COMMENCING IT IS BUT FAIR TO WARN YOU THAT THE STORY WILL SOUND
SOMEWHAT HACKNEYED IN YOUR EARS BUT STALE DETAILS OFTEN REGAIN A DEGREE
OF FRESHNESS WHEN THEY PASS THROUGH NEW LIPS
FOR THE REST WHETHER
TRITE OR NOVEL IT IS SHORT
TWENTY YEARS AGO A POOR CURATE NEVER MIND HIS NAME AT THIS MOMENT FELL
IN LOVE WITH A RICH MAN'S DAUGHTER SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM AND
MARRIED HIM AGAINST THE ADVICE OF ALL HER FRIENDS WHO CONSEQUENTLY
DISOWNED HER IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WEDDING
BEFORE TWO YEARS PASSED THE
RASH PAIR WERE BOTH DEAD AND LAID QUIETLY SIDE BY SIDE UNDER ONE SLAB
I HAVE SEEN THEIR GRAVE IT FORMED PART OF THE PAVEMENT OF A HUGE
CHURCHYARD SURROUNDING THE GRIM SOOT BLACK OLD CATHEDRAL OF AN OVERGROWN
MANUFACTURING TOWN IN SHIRE THEY LEFT A DAUGHTER WHICH AT ITS
VERY BIRTH CHARITY RECEIVED IN HER LAP COLD AS THAT OF THE SNOW DRIFT I
ALMOST STUCK FAST IN TO NIGHT
CHARITY CARRIED THE FRIENDLESS THING TO
THE HOUSE OF ITS RICH MATERNAL RELATIONS IT WAS REARED BY AN AUNT IN
LAW CALLED I COME TO NAMES NOW MRS
REED OF GATESHEAD
YOU START DID
YOU HEAR A NOISE I DARESAY IT IS ONLY A RAT SCRAMBLING ALONG THE
RAFTERS OF THE ADJOINING SCHOOLROOM IT WAS A BARN BEFORE I HAD IT
REPAIRED AND ALTERED AND BARNS ARE GENERALLY HAUNTED BY RATS TO
PROCEED
MRS
REED KEPT THE ORPHAN TEN YEARS WHETHER IT WAS HAPPY OR
NOT WITH HER I CANNOT SAY NEVER HAVING BEEN TOLD BUT AT THE END OF
THAT TIME SHE TRANSFERRED IT TO A PLACE YOU KNOW BEING NO OTHER THAN
LOWOOD SCHOOL WHERE YOU SO LONG RESIDED YOURSELF
IT SEEMS HER CAREER
THERE WAS VERY HONOURABLE FROM A PUPIL SHE BECAME A TEACHER LIKE
YOURSELF REALLY IT STRIKES ME THERE ARE PARALLEL POINTS IN HER HISTORY
AND YOURS SHE LEFT IT TO BE A GOVERNESS THERE AGAIN YOUR FATES WERE
ANALOGOUS SHE UNDERTOOK THE EDUCATION OF THE WARD OF A CERTAIN MR
ROCHESTER
MR
RIVERS I INTERRUPTED
I CAN GUESS YOUR FEELINGS HE SAID BUT RESTRAIN THEM FOR A WHILE I
HAVE NEARLY FINISHED HEAR ME TO THE END
OF MR
ROCHESTER'S CHARACTER I
KNOW NOTHING BUT THE ONE FACT THAT HE PROFESSED TO OFFER HONOURABLE
MARRIAGE TO THIS YOUNG GIRL AND THAT AT THE VERY ALTAR SHE DISCOVERED HE
HAD A WIFE YET ALIVE THOUGH A LUNATIC
WHAT HIS SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT AND
PROPOSALS WERE IS A MATTER OF PURE CONJECTURE BUT WHEN AN EVENT
TRANSPIRED WHICH RENDERED INQUIRY AFTER THE GOVERNESS NECESSARY IT WAS
DISCOVERED SHE WAS GONE NO ONE COULD TELL WHEN WHERE OR HOW
SHE HAD
LEFT THORNFIELD HALL IN THE NIGHT EVERY RESEARCH AFTER HER COURSE HAD
BEEN VAIN THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN SCOURED FAR AND WIDE NO VESTIGE OF
INFORMATION COULD BE GATHERED RESPECTING HER
YET THAT SHE SHOULD BE
FOUND IS BECOME A MATTER OF SERIOUS URGENCY ADVERTISEMENTS HAVE BEEN PUT
IN ALL THE PAPERS I MYSELF HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM ONE MR
BRIGGS A
SOLICITOR COMMUNICATING THE DETAILS I HAVE JUST IMPARTED
IS IT NOT AN
ODD TALE
JUST TELL ME THIS SAID I AND SINCE YOU KNOW SO MUCH YOU SURELY CAN
TELL IT ME WHAT OF MR
ROCHESTER HOW AND WHERE IS HE WHAT IS HE
DOING IS HE WELL
I AM IGNORANT OF ALL CONCERNING MR
ROCHESTER THE LETTER NEVER MENTIONS
HIM BUT TO NARRATE THE FRAUDULENT AND ILLEGAL ATTEMPT I HAVE ADVERTED TO
YOU SHOULD RATHER ASK THE NAME OF THE GOVERNESS THE NATURE OF THE EVENT
WHICH REQUIRES HER APPEARANCE
DID NO ONE GO TO THORNFIELD HALL THEN DID NO ONE SEE MR
ROCHESTER
I SUPPOSE NOT
BUT THEY WROTE TO HIM
OF COURSE
AND WHAT DID HE SAY WHO HAS HIS LETTERS
MR
BRIGGS INTIMATES THAT THE ANSWER TO HIS APPLICATION WAS NOT FROM MR
ROCHESTER BUT FROM A LADY IT IS SIGNED 'ALICE FAIRFAX
I FELT COLD AND DISMAYED MY WORST FEARS THEN WERE PROBABLY TRUE HE HAD
IN ALL PROBABILITY LEFT ENGLAND AND RUSHED IN RECKLESS DESPERATION TO
SOME FORMER HAUNT ON THE CONTINENT
AND WHAT OPIATE FOR HIS SEVERE
SUFFERINGS WHAT OBJECT FOR HIS STRONG PASSIONS HAD HE SOUGHT THERE I
DARED NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION
OH MY POOR MASTER ONCE ALMOST MY
HUSBAND WHOM I HAD OFTEN CALLED MY DEAR EDWARD
HE MUST HAVE BEEN A BAD MAN OBSERVED MR
RIVERS
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM DON'T PRONOUNCE AN OPINION UPON HIM I SAID WITH
WARMTH
VERY WELL HE ANSWERED QUIETLY AND INDEED MY HEAD IS OTHERWISE
OCCUPIED THAN WITH HIM I HAVE MY TALE TO FINISH
SINCE YOU WON'T ASK
THE GOVERNESS'S NAME I MUST TELL IT OF MY OWN ACCORD
STAY I HAVE IT
HERE IT IS ALWAYS MORE SATISFACTORY TO SEE IMPORTANT POINTS WRITTEN
DOWN FAIRLY COMMITTED TO BLACK AND WHITE
AND THE POCKET BOOK WAS AGAIN DELIBERATELY PRODUCED OPENED SOUGHT
THROUGH FROM ONE OF ITS COMPARTMENTS WAS EXTRACTED A SHABBY SLIP OF
PAPER HASTILY TORN OFF I RECOGNISED IN ITS TEXTURE AND ITS STAINS OF
ULTRA MARINE AND LAKE AND VERMILLION THE RAVISHED MARGIN OF THE
PORTRAIT COVER
HE GOT UP HELD IT CLOSE TO MY EYES AND I READ TRACED
IN INDIAN INK IN MY OWN HANDWRITING THE WORDS JANE EYRE THE WORK
DOUBTLESS OF SOME MOMENT OF ABSTRACTION
BRIGGS WROTE TO ME OF A JANE EYRE HE SAID THE ADVERTISEMENTS
DEMANDED A JANE EYRE I KNEW A JANE ELLIOTT I CONFESS I HAD MY
SUSPICIONS BUT IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THEY WERE AT ONCE
RESOLVED INTO CERTAINTY
YOU OWN THE NAME AND RENOUNCE THE ALIAS
YES YES BUT WHERE IS MR
BRIGGS HE PERHAPS KNOWS MORE OF MR
ROCHESTER THAN YOU DO
BRIGGS IS IN LONDON
I SHOULD DOUBT HIS KNOWING ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT
MR
ROCHESTER IT IS NOT IN MR
ROCHESTER HE IS INTERESTED
MEANTIME
YOU FORGET ESSENTIAL POINTS IN PURSUING TRIFLES YOU DO NOT INQUIRE WHY
MR
BRIGGS SOUGHT AFTER YOU WHAT HE WANTED WITH YOU
WELL WHAT DID HE WANT
MERELY TO TELL YOU THAT YOUR UNCLE MR
EYRE OF MADEIRA IS DEAD THAT
HE HAS LEFT YOU ALL HIS PROPERTY AND THAT YOU ARE NOW RICH MERELY
THAT NOTHING MORE
I RICH
YES YOU RICH QUITE AN HEIRESS
SILENCE SUCCEEDED
YOU MUST PROVE YOUR IDENTITY OF COURSE RESUMED ST
JOHN PRESENTLY A
STEP WHICH WILL OFFER NO DIFFICULTIES YOU CAN THEN ENTER ON IMMEDIATE
POSSESSION
YOUR FORTUNE IS VESTED IN THE ENGLISH FUNDS BRIGGS HAS THE
WILL AND THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS
HERE WAS A NEW CARD TURNED UP IT IS A FINE THING READER TO BE LIFTED
IN A MOMENT FROM INDIGENCE TO WEALTH A VERY FINE THING BUT NOT A MATTER
ONE CAN COMPREHEND OR CONSEQUENTLY ENJOY ALL AT ONCE
AND THEN THERE
ARE OTHER CHANCES IN LIFE FAR MORE THRILLING AND RAPTURE GIVING THIS
IS SOLID AN AFFAIR OF THE ACTUAL WORLD NOTHING IDEAL ABOUT IT ALL ITS
ASSOCIATIONS ARE SOLID AND SOBER AND ITS MANIFESTATIONS ARE THE SAME
ONE DOES NOT JUMP AND SPRING AND SHOUT HURRAH AT HEARING ONE HAS GOT A
FORTUNE ONE BEGINS TO CONSIDER RESPONSIBILITIES AND TO PONDER BUSINESS
ON A BASE OF STEADY SATISFACTION RISE CERTAIN GRAVE CARES AND WE CONTAIN
OURSELVES AND BROOD OVER OUR BLISS WITH A SOLEMN BROW
BESIDES THE WORDS LEGACY BEQUEST GO SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE WORDS
DEATH FUNERAL
MY UNCLE I HAD HEARD WAS DEAD MY ONLY RELATIVE EVER
SINCE BEING MADE AWARE OF HIS EXISTENCE I HAD CHERISHED THE HOPE OF ONE
DAY SEEING HIM NOW I NEVER SHOULD
AND THEN THIS MONEY CAME ONLY TO
ME NOT TO ME AND A REJOICING FAMILY BUT TO MY ISOLATED SELF
IT WAS A
GRAND BOON DOUBTLESS AND INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE GLORIOUS YES I FELT
THAT THAT THOUGHT SWELLED MY HEART
YOU UNBEND YOUR FOREHEAD AT LAST SAID MR
RIVERS
I THOUGHT MEDUSA
HAD LOOKED AT YOU AND THAT YOU WERE TURNING TO STONE
PERHAPS NOW YOU
WILL ASK HOW MUCH YOU ARE WORTH
HOW MUCH AM I WORTH
OH A TRIFLE NOTHING OF COURSE TO SPEAK OF TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS I
THINK THEY SAY BUT WHAT IS THAT
TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS
HERE WAS A NEW STUNNER I HAD BEEN CALCULATING ON FOUR OR FIVE THOUSAND
THIS NEWS ACTUALLY TOOK MY BREATH FOR A MOMENT MR
ST
JOHN WHOM I HAD
NEVER HEARD LAUGH BEFORE LAUGHED NOW
WELL SAID HE IF YOU HAD COMMITTED A MURDER AND I HAD TOLD YOU YOUR
CRIME WAS DISCOVERED YOU COULD SCARCELY LOOK MORE AGHAST
IT IS A LARGE SUM DON'T YOU THINK THERE IS A MISTAKE
NO MISTAKE AT ALL
PERHAPS YOU HAVE READ THE FIGURES WRONG IT MAY BE TWO THOUSAND
IT IS WRITTEN IN LETTERS NOT FIGURES TWENTY THOUSAND
I AGAIN FELT RATHER LIKE AN INDIVIDUAL OF BUT AVERAGE GASTRONOMICAL
POWERS SITTING DOWN TO FEAST ALONE AT A TABLE SPREAD WITH PROVISIONS FOR
A HUNDRED
MR
RIVERS ROSE NOW AND PUT HIS CLOAK ON
IF IT WERE NOT SUCH A VERY WILD NIGHT HE SAID I WOULD SEND HANNAH
DOWN TO KEEP YOU COMPANY YOU LOOK TOO DESPERATELY MISERABLE TO BE LEFT
ALONE
BUT HANNAH POOR WOMAN COULD NOT STRIDE THE DRIFTS SO WELL AS I
HER LEGS ARE NOT QUITE SO LONG SO I MUST E'EN LEAVE YOU TO YOUR SORROWS
GOOD NIGHT
HE WAS LIFTING THE LATCH A SUDDEN THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME
STOP ONE
MINUTE I CRIED
WELL
IT PUZZLES ME TO KNOW WHY MR
BRIGGS WROTE TO YOU ABOUT ME OR HOW HE
KNEW YOU OR COULD FANCY THAT YOU LIVING IN SUCH AN OUT OF THE WAY
PLACE HAD THE POWER TO AID IN MY DISCOVERY
OH I AM A CLERGYMAN HE SAID AND THE CLERGY ARE OFTEN APPEALED TO
ABOUT ODD MATTERS AGAIN THE LATCH RATTLED
NO THAT DOES NOT SATISFY ME I EXCLAIMED AND INDEED THERE WAS
SOMETHING IN THE HASTY AND UNEXPLANATORY REPLY WHICH INSTEAD OF
ALLAYING PIQUED MY CURIOSITY MORE THAN EVER
IT IS A VERY STRANGE PIECE OF BUSINESS I ADDED I MUST KNOW MORE
ABOUT IT
ANOTHER TIME
NO TO NIGHT TO NIGHT AND AS HE TURNED FROM THE DOOR I PLACED
MYSELF BETWEEN IT AND HIM
HE LOOKED RATHER EMBARRASSED
YOU CERTAINLY SHALL NOT GO TILL YOU HAVE TOLD ME ALL I SAID
I WOULD RATHER NOT JUST NOW
YOU SHALL YOU MUST
I WOULD RATHER DIANA OR MARY INFORMED YOU
OF COURSE THESE OBJECTIONS WROUGHT MY EAGERNESS TO A CLIMAX GRATIFIED IT
MUST BE AND THAT WITHOUT DELAY AND I TOLD HIM SO
BUT I APPRISED YOU THAT I WAS A HARD MAN SAID HE DIFFICULT TO
PERSUADE
AND I AM A HARD WOMAN IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT OFF
AND I AM A HARD WOMAN IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT OFF P369 JPG
AND THEN HE PURSUED I AM COLD NO FERVOUR INFECTS ME
WHEREAS I AM HOT AND FIRE DISSOLVES ICE
THE BLAZE THERE HAS THAWED
ALL THE SNOW FROM YOUR CLOAK BY THE SAME TOKEN IT HAS STREAMED ON TO MY
FLOOR AND MADE IT LIKE A TRAMPLED STREET
AS YOU HOPE EVER TO BE
FORGIVEN MR
RIVERS THE HIGH CRIME AND MISDEMEANOUR OF SPOILING A
SANDED KITCHEN TELL ME WHAT I WISH TO KNOW
WELL THEN HE SAID I YIELD IF NOT TO YOUR EARNESTNESS TO YOUR
PERSEVERANCE AS STONE IS WORN BY CONTINUAL DROPPING
BESIDES YOU MUST
KNOW SOME DAY AS WELL NOW AS LATER
YOUR NAME IS JANE EYRE
OF COURSE THAT WAS ALL SETTLED BEFORE
YOU ARE NOT PERHAPS AWARE THAT I AM YOUR NAMESAKE THAT I WAS
CHRISTENED ST
JOHN EYRE RIVERS
NO INDEED I REMEMBER NOW SEEING THE LETTER E
COMPRISED IN YOUR
INITIALS WRITTEN IN BOOKS YOU HAVE AT DIFFERENT TIMES LENT ME BUT I
NEVER ASKED FOR WHAT NAME IT STOOD
BUT WHAT THEN SURELY
I STOPPED I COULD NOT TRUST MYSELF TO ENTERTAIN MUCH LESS TO EXPRESS
THE THOUGHT THAT RUSHED UPON ME THAT EMBODIED ITSELF THAT IN A
SECOND STOOD OUT A STRONG SOLID PROBABILITY
CIRCUMSTANCES KNIT
THEMSELVES FITTED THEMSELVES SHOT INTO ORDER THE CHAIN THAT HAD BEEN
LYING HITHERTO A FORMLESS LUMP OF LINKS WAS DRAWN OUT STRAIGHT EVERY
RING WAS PERFECT THE CONNECTION COMPLETE
I KNEW BY INSTINCT HOW THE
MATTER STOOD BEFORE ST
JOHN HAD SAID ANOTHER WORD BUT I CANNOT EXPECT
THE READER TO HAVE THE SAME INTUITIVE PERCEPTION SO I MUST REPEAT HIS
EXPLANATION
MY MOTHER'S NAME WAS EYRE SHE HAD TWO BROTHERS ONE A CLERGYMAN WHO
MARRIED MISS JANE REED OF GATESHEAD THE OTHER JOHN EYRE ESQ
MERCHANT LATE OF FUNCHAL MADEIRA
MR
BRIGGS BEING MR
EYRE'S
SOLICITOR WROTE TO US LAST AUGUST TO INFORM US OF OUR UNCLE'S DEATH AND
TO SAY THAT HE HAD LEFT HIS PROPERTY TO HIS BROTHER THE CLERGYMAN'S
ORPHAN DAUGHTER OVERLOOKING US IN CONSEQUENCE OF A QUARREL NEVER
FORGIVEN BETWEEN HIM AND MY FATHER
HE WROTE AGAIN A FEW WEEKS SINCE
TO INTIMATE THAT THE HEIRESS WAS LOST AND ASKING IF WE KNEW ANYTHING OF
HER
A NAME CASUALLY WRITTEN ON A SLIP OF PAPER HAS ENABLED ME TO FIND
HER OUT
YOU KNOW THE REST AGAIN HE WAS GOING BUT I SET MY BACK
AGAINST THE DOOR
DO LET ME SPEAK I SAID LET ME HAVE ONE MOMENT TO DRAW BREATH AND
REFLECT I PAUSED HE STOOD BEFORE ME HAT IN HAND LOOKING COMPOSED
ENOUGH
I RESUMED
YOUR MOTHER WAS MY FATHER'S SISTER
YES
MY AUNT CONSEQUENTLY
HE BOWED
MY UNCLE JOHN WAS YOUR UNCLE JOHN YOU DIANA AND MARY ARE HIS
SISTER'S CHILDREN AS I AM HIS BROTHER'S CHILD
UNDENIABLY
YOU THREE THEN ARE MY COUSINS HALF OUR BLOOD ON EACH SIDE FLOWS FROM
THE SAME SOURCE
WE ARE COUSINS YES
I SURVEYED HIM
IT SEEMED I HAD FOUND A BROTHER ONE I COULD BE PROUD
OF ONE I COULD LOVE AND TWO SISTERS WHOSE QUALITIES WERE SUCH THAT
WHEN I KNEW THEM BUT AS MERE STRANGERS THEY HAD INSPIRED ME WITH GENUINE
AFFECTION AND ADMIRATION
THE TWO GIRLS ON WHOM KNEELING DOWN ON THE
WET GROUND AND LOOKING THROUGH THE LOW LATTICED WINDOW OF MOOR HOUSE
KITCHEN I HAD GAZED WITH SO BITTER A MIXTURE OF INTEREST AND DESPAIR
WERE MY NEAR KINSWOMEN AND THE YOUNG AND STATELY GENTLEMAN WHO HAD FOUND
ME ALMOST DYING AT HIS THRESHOLD WAS MY BLOOD RELATION
GLORIOUS
DISCOVERY TO A LONELY WRETCH THIS WAS WEALTH INDEED WEALTH TO THE
HEART A MINE OF PURE GENIAL AFFECTIONS
THIS WAS A BLESSING BRIGHT
VIVID AND EXHILARATING NOT LIKE THE PONDEROUS GIFT OF GOLD RICH AND
WELCOME ENOUGH IN ITS WAY BUT SOBERING FROM ITS WEIGHT
I NOW CLAPPED
MY HANDS IN SUDDEN JOY MY PULSE BOUNDED MY VEINS THRILLED
OH I AM GLAD I AM GLAD I EXCLAIMED
ST
JOHN SMILED
DID I NOT SAY YOU NEGLECTED ESSENTIAL POINTS TO PURSUE
TRIFLES HE ASKED
YOU WERE SERIOUS WHEN I TOLD YOU YOU HAD GOT A
FORTUNE AND NOW FOR A MATTER OF NO MOMENT YOU ARE EXCITED
WHAT CAN YOU MEAN IT MAY BE OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YOU HAVE SISTERS AND
DON'T CARE FOR A COUSIN BUT I HAD NOBODY AND NOW THREE RELATIONS OR
TWO IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO BE COUNTED ARE BORN INTO MY WORLD
FULL GROWN
I SAY AGAIN I AM GLAD
I WALKED FAST THROUGH THE ROOM I STOPPED HALF SUFFOCATED WITH THE
THOUGHTS THAT ROSE FASTER THAN I COULD RECEIVE COMPREHEND SETTLE
THEM THOUGHTS OF WHAT MIGHT COULD WOULD AND SHOULD BE AND THAT ERE
LONG
I LOOKED AT THE BLANK WALL IT SEEMED A SKY THICK WITH ASCENDING
STARS EVERY ONE LIT ME TO A PURPOSE OR DELIGHT
THOSE WHO HAD SAVED MY
LIFE WHOM TILL THIS HOUR I HAD LOVED BARRENLY I COULD NOW BENEFIT
THEY WERE UNDER A YOKE I COULD FREE THEM THEY WERE SCATTERED I COULD
REUNITE THEM THE INDEPENDENCE THE AFFLUENCE WHICH WAS MINE MIGHT BE
THEIRS TOO
WERE WE NOT FOUR TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS SHARED EQUALLY
WOULD BE FIVE THOUSAND EACH JUSTICE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE JUSTICE WOULD
BE DONE MUTUAL HAPPINESS SECURED
NOW THE WEALTH DID NOT WEIGH ON ME
NOW IT WAS NOT A MERE BEQUEST OF COIN IT WAS A LEGACY OF LIFE HOPE
ENJOYMENT
HOW I LOOKED WHILE THESE IDEAS WERE TAKING MY SPIRIT BY STORM I CANNOT
TELL BUT I PERCEIVED SOON THAT MR
RIVERS HAD PLACED A CHAIR BEHIND ME
AND WAS GENTLY ATTEMPTING TO MAKE ME SIT DOWN ON IT
HE ALSO ADVISED ME
TO BE COMPOSED I SCORNED THE INSINUATION OF HELPLESSNESS AND
DISTRACTION SHOOK OFF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO WALK ABOUT AGAIN
WRITE TO DIANA AND MARY TO MORROW I SAID AND TELL THEM TO COME HOME
DIRECTLY
DIANA SAID THEY WOULD BOTH CONSIDER THEMSELVES RICH WITH A
THOUSAND POUNDS SO WITH FIVE THOUSAND THEY WILL DO VERY WELL
TELL ME WHERE I CAN GET YOU A GLASS OF WATER SAID ST
JOHN YOU MUST
REALLY MAKE AN EFFORT TO TRANQUILLISE YOUR FEELINGS
NONSENSE AND WHAT SORT OF AN EFFECT WILL THE BEQUEST HAVE ON YOU WILL
IT KEEP YOU IN ENGLAND INDUCE YOU TO MARRY MISS OLIVER AND SETTLE DOWN
LIKE AN ORDINARY MORTAL
YOU WANDER YOUR HEAD BECOMES CONFUSED
I HAVE BEEN TOO ABRUPT IN
COMMUNICATING THE NEWS IT HAS EXCITED YOU BEYOND YOUR STRENGTH
MR
RIVERS YOU QUITE PUT ME OUT OF PATIENCE I AM RATIONAL ENOUGH IT
IS YOU WHO MISUNDERSTAND OR RATHER WHO AFFECT TO MISUNDERSTAND
PERHAPS IF YOU EXPLAINED YOURSELF A LITTLE MORE FULLY I SHOULD
COMPREHEND BETTER
EXPLAIN WHAT IS THERE TO EXPLAIN YOU CANNOT FAIL TO SEE THAT TWENTY
THOUSAND POUNDS THE SUM IN QUESTION DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE NEPHEW
AND THREE NIECES OF OUR UNCLE WILL GIVE FIVE THOUSAND TO EACH WHAT I
WANT IS THAT YOU SHOULD WRITE TO YOUR SISTERS AND TELL THEM OF THE
FORTUNE THAT HAS ACCRUED TO THEM
TO YOU YOU MEAN
I HAVE INTIMATED MY VIEW OF THE CASE I AM INCAPABLE OF TAKING ANY
OTHER
I AM NOT BRUTALLY SELFISH BLINDLY UNJUST OR FIENDISHLY
UNGRATEFUL
BESIDES I AM RESOLVED I WILL HAVE A HOME AND CONNECTIONS
I
LIKE MOOR HOUSE AND I WILL LIVE AT MOOR HOUSE I LIKE DIANA AND MARY
AND I WILL ATTACH MYSELF FOR LIFE TO DIANA AND MARY
IT WOULD PLEASE AND
BENEFIT ME TO HAVE FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS IT WOULD TORMENT AND OPPRESS ME
TO HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND WHICH MOREOVER COULD NEVER BE MINE IN JUSTICE
THOUGH IT MIGHT IN LAW
I ABANDON TO YOU THEN WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY
SUPERFLUOUS TO ME
LET THERE BE NO OPPOSITION AND NO DISCUSSION ABOUT
IT LET US AGREE AMONGST EACH OTHER AND DECIDE THE POINT AT ONCE
THIS IS ACTING ON FIRST IMPULSES YOU MUST TAKE DAYS TO CONSIDER SUCH A
MATTER ERE YOUR WORD CAN BE REGARDED AS VALID
OH IF ALL YOU DOUBT IS MY SINCERITY I AM EASY YOU SEE THE JUSTICE OF
THE CASE
I DO SEE A CERTAIN JUSTICE BUT IT IS CONTRARY TO ALL CUSTOM
BESIDES
THE ENTIRE FORTUNE IS YOUR RIGHT MY UNCLE GAINED IT BY HIS OWN EFFORTS
HE WAS FREE TO LEAVE IT TO WHOM HE WOULD HE LEFT IT TO YOU
AFTER ALL
JUSTICE PERMITS YOU TO KEEP IT YOU MAY WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE
CONSIDER IT ABSOLUTELY YOUR OWN
WITH ME SAID I IT IS FULLY AS MUCH A MATTER OF FEELING AS OF
CONSCIENCE I MUST INDULGE MY FEELINGS I SO SELDOM HAVE HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO
WERE YOU TO ARGUE OBJECT AND ANNOY ME FOR A
YEAR I COULD NOT FOREGO THE DELICIOUS PLEASURE OF WHICH I HAVE CAUGHT A
GLIMPSE THAT OF REPAYING IN PART A MIGHTY OBLIGATION AND WINNING TO
MYSELF LIFELONG FRIENDS
YOU THINK SO NOW REJOINED ST
JOHN BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT
IS TO POSSESS NOR CONSEQUENTLY TO ENJOY WEALTH YOU CANNOT FORM A NOTION
OF THE IMPORTANCE TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS WOULD GIVE YOU OF THE PLACE IT
WOULD ENABLE YOU TO TAKE IN SOCIETY OF THE PROSPECTS IT WOULD OPEN TO
YOU YOU CANNOT
AND YOU I INTERRUPTED CANNOT AT ALL IMAGINE THE CRAVING I HAVE FOR
FRATERNAL AND SISTERLY LOVE
I NEVER HAD A HOME I NEVER HAD BROTHERS OR
SISTERS I MUST AND WILL HAVE THEM NOW YOU ARE NOT RELUCTANT TO ADMIT ME
AND OWN ME ARE YOU
JANE I WILL BE YOUR BROTHER MY SISTERS WILL BE YOUR SISTERS WITHOUT
STIPULATING FOR THIS SACRIFICE OF YOUR JUST RIGHTS
BROTHER YES AT THE DISTANCE OF A THOUSAND LEAGUES SISTERS YES
SLAVING AMONGST STRANGERS I WEALTHY GORGED WITH GOLD I NEVER EARNED
AND DO NOT MERIT YOU PENNILESS FAMOUS EQUALITY AND FRATERNISATION
CLOSE UNION INTIMATE ATTACHMENT
BUT JANE YOUR ASPIRATIONS AFTER FAMILY TIES AND DOMESTIC HAPPINESS MAY
BE REALISED OTHERWISE THAN BY THE MEANS YOU CONTEMPLATE YOU MAY MARRY
NONSENSE AGAIN MARRY I DON'T WANT TO MARRY AND NEVER SHALL MARRY
THAT IS SAYING TOO MUCH SUCH HAZARDOUS AFFIRMATIONS ARE A PROOF OF THE
EXCITEMENT UNDER WHICH YOU LABOUR
IT IS NOT SAYING TOO MUCH I KNOW WHAT I FEEL AND HOW AVERSE ARE MY
INCLINATIONS TO THE BARE THOUGHT OF MARRIAGE
NO ONE WOULD TAKE ME FOR
LOVE AND I WILL NOT BE REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF A MERE MONEY
SPECULATION
AND I DO NOT WANT A STRANGER UNSYMPATHISING ALIEN
DIFFERENT FROM ME I WANT MY KINDRED THOSE WITH WHOM I HAVE FULL FELLOW
FEELING
SAY AGAIN YOU WILL BE MY BROTHER WHEN YOU UTTERED THE WORDS I
WAS SATISFIED HAPPY REPEAT THEM IF YOU CAN REPEAT THEM SINCERELY
I THINK I CAN
I KNOW I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED MY OWN SISTERS AND I KNOW ON
WHAT MY AFFECTION FOR THEM IS GROUNDED RESPECT FOR THEIR WORTH AND
ADMIRATION OF THEIR TALENTS
YOU TOO HAVE PRINCIPLE AND MIND YOUR
TASTES AND HABITS RESEMBLE DIANA'S AND MARY'S YOUR PRESENCE IS ALWAYS
AGREEABLE TO ME IN YOUR CONVERSATION I HAVE ALREADY FOR SOME TIME FOUND
A SALUTARY SOLACE
I FEEL I CAN EASILY AND NATURALLY MAKE ROOM IN MY
HEART FOR YOU AS MY THIRD AND YOUNGEST SISTER
THANK YOU THAT CONTENTS ME FOR TO NIGHT
NOW YOU HAD BETTER GO FOR IF
YOU STAY LONGER YOU WILL PERHAPS IRRITATE ME AFRESH BY SOME MISTRUSTFUL
SCRUPLE
AND THE SCHOOL MISS EYRE IT MUST NOW BE SHUT UP I SUPPOSE
NO
I WILL RETAIN MY POST OF MISTRESS TILL YOU GET A SUBSTITUTE
HE SMILED APPROBATION WE SHOOK HANDS AND HE TOOK LEAVE
I NEED NOT NARRATE IN DETAIL THE FURTHER STRUGGLES I HAD AND ARGUMENTS I
USED TO GET MATTERS REGARDING THE LEGACY SETTLED AS I WISHED
MY TASK
WAS A VERY HARD ONE BUT AS I WAS ABSOLUTELY RESOLVED AS MY COUSINS SAW
AT LENGTH THAT MY MIND WAS REALLY AND IMMUTABLY FIXED ON MAKING A JUST
DIVISION OF THE PROPERTY AS THEY MUST IN THEIR OWN HEARTS HAVE FELT THE
EQUITY OF THE INTENTION AND MUST BESIDES HAVE BEEN INNATELY CONSCIOUS
THAT IN MY PLACE THEY WOULD HAVE DONE PRECISELY WHAT I WISHED TO DO THEY
YIELDED AT LENGTH SO FAR AS TO CONSENT TO PUT THE AFFAIR TO ARBITRATION
THE JUDGES CHOSEN WERE MR
OLIVER AND AN ABLE LAWYER BOTH COINCIDED IN
MY OPINION I CARRIED MY POINT
THE INSTRUMENTS OF TRANSFER WERE DRAWN
OUT ST
JOHN DIANA MARY AND I EACH BECAME POSSESSED OF A COMPETENCY
CHAPTER XXXIV
IT WAS NEAR CHRISTMAS BY THE TIME ALL WAS SETTLED THE SEASON OF GENERAL
HOLIDAY APPROACHED
I NOW CLOSED MORTON SCHOOL TAKING CARE THAT THE
PARTING SHOULD NOT BE BARREN ON MY SIDE
GOOD FORTUNE OPENS THE HAND AS
WELL AS THE HEART WONDERFULLY AND TO GIVE SOMEWHAT WHEN WE HAVE LARGELY
RECEIVED IS BUT TO AFFORD A VENT TO THE UNUSUAL EBULLITION OF THE
SENSATIONS
I HAD LONG FELT WITH PLEASURE THAT MANY OF MY RUSTIC
SCHOLARS LIKED ME AND WHEN WE PARTED THAT CONSCIOUSNESS WAS CONFIRMED
THEY MANIFESTED THEIR AFFECTION PLAINLY AND STRONGLY
DEEP WAS MY
GRATIFICATION TO FIND I HAD REALLY A PLACE IN THEIR UNSOPHISTICATED
HEARTS I PROMISED THEM THAT NEVER A WEEK SHOULD PASS IN FUTURE THAT I
DID NOT VISIT THEM AND GIVE THEM AN HOUR'S TEACHING IN THEIR SCHOOL
MR
RIVERS CAME UP AS HAVING SEEN THE CLASSES NOW NUMBERING SIXTY
GIRLS FILE OUT BEFORE ME AND LOCKED THE DOOR I STOOD WITH THE KEY IN
MY HAND EXCHANGING A FEW WORDS OF SPECIAL FAREWELL WITH SOME HALF DOZEN
OF MY BEST SCHOLARS AS DECENT RESPECTABLE MODEST AND WELL INFORMED
YOUNG WOMEN AS COULD BE FOUND IN THE RANKS OF THE BRITISH PEASANTRY
AND
THAT IS SAYING A GREAT DEAL FOR AFTER ALL THE BRITISH PEASANTRY ARE THE
BEST TAUGHT BEST MANNERED MOST SELF RESPECTING OF ANY IN EUROPE SINCE
THOSE DAYS I HAVE SEEN PAYSANNES AND BAUERINNEN AND THE BEST OF THEM
SEEMED TO ME IGNORANT COARSE AND BESOTTED COMPARED WITH MY MORTON
GIRLS
DO YOU CONSIDER YOU HAVE GOT YOUR REWARD FOR A SEASON OF EXERTION
ASKED MR
RIVERS WHEN THEY WERE GONE
DOES NOT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
HAVING DONE SOME REAL GOOD IN YOUR DAY AND GENERATION GIVE PLEASURE
DOUBTLESS
AND YOU HAVE ONLY TOILED A FEW MONTHS WOULD NOT A LIFE DEVOTED TO THE
TASK OF REGENERATING YOUR RACE BE WELL SPENT
YES I SAID BUT I COULD NOT GO ON FOR EVER SO I WANT TO ENJOY MY OWN
FACULTIES AS WELL AS TO CULTIVATE THOSE OF OTHER PEOPLE
I MUST ENJOY
THEM NOW DON'T RECALL EITHER MY MIND OR BODY TO THE SCHOOL I AM OUT OF
IT AND DISPOSED FOR FULL HOLIDAY
HE LOOKED GRAVE
WHAT NOW WHAT SUDDEN EAGERNESS IS THIS YOU EVINCE
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
TO BE ACTIVE AS ACTIVE AS I CAN
AND FIRST I MUST BEG YOU TO SET
HANNAH AT LIBERTY AND GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO WAIT ON YOU
DO YOU WANT HER
YES TO GO WITH ME TO MOOR HOUSE
DIANA AND MARY WILL BE AT HOME IN A
WEEK AND I WANT TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN ORDER AGAINST THEIR ARRIVAL
I UNDERSTAND
I THOUGHT YOU WERE FOR FLYING OFF ON SOME EXCURSION
IT
IS BETTER SO HANNAH SHALL GO WITH YOU
TELL HER TO BE READY BY TO MORROW THEN AND HERE IS THE SCHOOLROOM KEY
I WILL GIVE YOU THE KEY OF MY COTTAGE IN THE MORNING
HE TOOK IT
YOU GIVE IT UP VERY GLEEFULLY SAID HE I DON'T QUITE
UNDERSTAND YOUR LIGHT HEARTEDNESS BECAUSE I CANNOT TELL WHAT EMPLOYMENT
YOU PROPOSE TO YOURSELF AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE ONE YOU ARE
RELINQUISHING
WHAT AIM WHAT PURPOSE WHAT AMBITION IN LIFE HAVE YOU
NOW
MY FIRST AIM WILL BE TO CLEAN DOWN DO YOU COMPREHEND THE FULL FORCE
OF THE EXPRESSION TO CLEAN DOWN MOOR HOUSE FROM CHAMBER TO CELLAR
MY NEXT TO RUB IT UP WITH BEES WAX OIL AND AN INDEFINITE NUMBER OF
CLOTHS TILL IT GLITTERS AGAIN MY THIRD TO ARRANGE EVERY CHAIR TABLE
BED CARPET WITH MATHEMATICAL PRECISION AFTERWARDS I SHALL GO NEAR TO
RUIN YOU IN COALS AND PEAT TO KEEP UP GOOD FIRES IN EVERY ROOM AND
LASTLY THE TWO DAYS PRECEDING THAT ON WHICH YOUR SISTERS ARE EXPECTED
WILL BE DEVOTED BY HANNAH AND ME TO SUCH A BEATING OF EGGS SORTING OF
CURRANTS GRATING OF SPICES COMPOUNDING OF CHRISTMAS CAKES CHOPPING UP
OF MATERIALS FOR MINCE PIES AND SOLEMNISING OF OTHER CULINARY RITES AS
WORDS CAN CONVEY BUT AN INADEQUATE NOTION OF TO THE UNINITIATED LIKE YOU
MY PURPOSE IN SHORT IS TO HAVE ALL THINGS IN AN ABSOLUTELY PERFECT
STATE OF READINESS FOR DIANA AND MARY BEFORE NEXT THURSDAY AND MY
AMBITION IS TO GIVE THEM A BEAU IDEAL OF A WELCOME WHEN THEY COME
ST
JOHN SMILED SLIGHTLY STILL HE WAS DISSATISFIED
IT IS ALL VERY WELL FOR THE PRESENT SAID HE BUT SERIOUSLY I TRUST
THAT WHEN THE FIRST FLUSH OF VIVACITY IS OVER YOU WILL LOOK A LITTLE
HIGHER THAN DOMESTIC ENDEARMENTS AND HOUSEHOLD JOYS
THE BEST THINGS THE WORLD HAS I INTERRUPTED
NO JANE NO THIS WORLD IS NOT THE SCENE OF FRUITION DO NOT ATTEMPT TO
MAKE IT SO NOR OF REST DO NOT TURN SLOTHFUL
I MEAN ON THE CONTRARY TO BE BUSY
JANE I EXCUSE YOU FOR THE PRESENT TWO MONTHS' GRACE I ALLOW YOU FOR
THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF YOUR NEW POSITION AND FOR PLEASING YOURSELF WITH
THIS LATE FOUND CHARM OF RELATIONSHIP BUT THEN I HOPE YOU WILL BEGIN
TO LOOK BEYOND MOOR HOUSE AND MORTON AND SISTERLY SOCIETY AND THE
SELFISH CALM AND SENSUAL COMFORT OF CIVILISED AFFLUENCE
I HOPE YOUR
ENERGIES WILL THEN ONCE MORE TROUBLE YOU WITH THEIR STRENGTH
I LOOKED AT HIM WITH SURPRISE
ST
JOHN I SAID I THINK YOU ARE
ALMOST WICKED TO TALK SO
I AM DISPOSED TO BE AS CONTENT AS A QUEEN AND
YOU TRY TO STIR ME UP TO RESTLESSNESS TO WHAT END
TO THE END OF TURNING TO PROFIT THE TALENTS WHICH GOD HAS COMMITTED TO
YOUR KEEPING AND OF WHICH HE WILL SURELY ONE DAY DEMAND A STRICT
ACCOUNT
JANE I SHALL WATCH YOU CLOSELY AND ANXIOUSLY I WARN YOU OF
THAT
AND TRY TO RESTRAIN THE DISPROPORTIONATE FERVOUR WITH WHICH YOU
THROW YOURSELF INTO COMMONPLACE HOME PLEASURES
DON'T CLING SO
TENACIOUSLY TO TIES OF THE FLESH SAVE YOUR CONSTANCY AND ARDOUR FOR AN
ADEQUATE CAUSE FORBEAR TO WASTE THEM ON TRITE TRANSIENT OBJECTS
DO YOU
HEAR JANE
YES JUST AS IF YOU WERE SPEAKING GREEK
I FEEL I HAVE ADEQUATE CAUSE
TO BE HAPPY AND I WILL BE HAPPY
GOODBYE
HAPPY AT MOOR HOUSE I WAS AND HARD I WORKED AND SO DID HANNAH SHE WAS
CHARMED TO SEE HOW JOVIAL I COULD BE AMIDST THE BUSTLE OF A HOUSE TURNED
TOPSY TURVY HOW I COULD BRUSH AND DUST AND CLEAN AND COOK
AND
REALLY AFTER A DAY OR TWO OF CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED IT WAS
DELIGHTFUL BY DEGREES TO INVOKE ORDER FROM THE CHAOS OURSELVES HAD MADE
I HAD PREVIOUSLY TAKEN A JOURNEY TO S TO PURCHASE SOME NEW FURNITURE
MY COUSINS HAVING GIVEN ME CARTE BLANCHE TO EFFECT WHAT ALTERATIONS I
PLEASED AND A SUM HAVING BEEN SET ASIDE FOR THAT PURPOSE
THE ORDINARY
SITTING ROOM AND BEDROOMS I LEFT MUCH AS THEY WERE FOR I KNEW DIANA AND
MARY WOULD DERIVE MORE PLEASURE FROM SEEING AGAIN THE OLD HOMELY TABLES
AND CHAIRS AND BEDS THAN FROM THE SPECTACLE OF THE SMARTEST
INNOVATIONS
STILL SOME NOVELTY WAS NECESSARY TO GIVE TO THEIR RETURN
THE PIQUANCY WITH WHICH I WISHED IT TO BE INVESTED
DARK HANDSOME NEW
CARPETS AND CURTAINS AN ARRANGEMENT OF SOME CAREFULLY SELECTED ANTIQUE
ORNAMENTS IN PORCELAIN AND BRONZE NEW COVERINGS AND MIRRORS AND
DRESSING CASES FOR THE TOILET TABLES ANSWERED THE END THEY LOOKED
FRESH WITHOUT BEING GLARING
A SPARE PARLOUR AND BEDROOM I REFURNISHED
ENTIRELY WITH OLD MAHOGANY AND CRIMSON UPHOLSTERY I LAID CANVAS ON THE
PASSAGE AND CARPETS ON THE STAIRS
WHEN ALL WAS FINISHED I THOUGHT
MOOR HOUSE AS COMPLETE A MODEL OF BRIGHT MODEST SNUGNESS WITHIN AS IT
WAS AT THIS SEASON A SPECIMEN OF WINTRY WASTE AND DESERT DREARINESS
WITHOUT
THE EVENTFUL THURSDAY AT LENGTH CAME
THEY WERE EXPECTED ABOUT DARK AND
ERE DUSK FIRES WERE LIT UPSTAIRS AND BELOW THE KITCHEN WAS IN PERFECT
TRIM HANNAH AND I WERE DRESSED AND ALL WAS IN READINESS
ST
JOHN ARRIVED FIRST
I HAD ENTREATED HIM TO KEEP QUITE CLEAR OF THE
HOUSE TILL EVERYTHING WAS ARRANGED AND INDEED THE BARE IDEA OF THE
COMMOTION AT ONCE SORDID AND TRIVIAL GOING ON WITHIN ITS WALLS SUFFICED
TO SCARE HIM TO ESTRANGEMENT
HE FOUND ME IN THE KITCHEN WATCHING THE
PROGRESS OF CERTAIN CAKES FOR TEA THEN BAKING
APPROACHING THE HEARTH
HE ASKED IF I WAS AT LAST SATISFIED WITH HOUSEMAID'S WORK I ANSWERED
BY INVITING HIM TO ACCOMPANY ME ON A GENERAL INSPECTION OF THE RESULT OF
MY LABOURS
WITH SOME DIFFICULTY I GOT HIM TO MAKE THE TOUR OF THE
HOUSE
HE JUST LOOKED IN AT THE DOORS I OPENED AND WHEN HE HAD WANDERED
UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS HE SAID I MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH A GREAT DEAL OF
FATIGUE AND TROUBLE TO HAVE EFFECTED SUCH CONSIDERABLE CHANGES IN SO
SHORT A TIME BUT NOT A SYLLABLE DID HE UTTER INDICATING PLEASURE IN THE
IMPROVED ASPECT OF HIS ABODE
THIS SILENCE DAMPED ME
I THOUGHT PERHAPS THE ALTERATIONS HAD DISTURBED
SOME OLD ASSOCIATIONS HE VALUED
I INQUIRED WHETHER THIS WAS THE CASE
NO DOUBT IN A SOMEWHAT CREST FALLEN TONE
NOT AT ALL HE HAD ON THE CONTRARY REMARKED THAT I HAD SCRUPULOUSLY
RESPECTED EVERY ASSOCIATION HE FEARED INDEED I MUST HAVE BESTOWED MORE
THOUGHT ON THE MATTER THAN IT WAS WORTH
HOW MANY MINUTES FOR INSTANCE
HAD I DEVOTED TO STUDYING THE ARRANGEMENT OF THIS VERY ROOM BY THE BYE
COULD I TELL HIM WHERE SUCH A BOOK WAS
I SHOWED HIM THE VOLUME ON THE SHELF HE TOOK IT DOWN AND WITHDRAWING TO
HIS ACCUSTOMED WINDOW RECESS HE BEGAN TO READ IT
NOW I DID NOT LIKE THIS READER
ST
JOHN WAS A GOOD MAN BUT I BEGAN
TO FEEL HE HAD SPOKEN TRUTH OF HIMSELF WHEN HE SAID HE WAS HARD AND COLD
THE HUMANITIES AND AMENITIES OF LIFE HAD NO ATTRACTION FOR HIM ITS
PEACEFUL ENJOYMENTS NO CHARM
LITERALLY HE LIVED ONLY TO ASPIRE AFTER
WHAT WAS GOOD AND GREAT CERTAINLY BUT STILL HE WOULD NEVER REST NOR
APPROVE OF OTHERS RESTING ROUND HIM
AS I LOOKED AT HIS LOFTY FOREHEAD
STILL AND PALE AS A WHITE STONE AT HIS FINE LINEAMENTS FIXED IN STUDY I
COMPREHENDED ALL AT ONCE THAT HE WOULD HARDLY MAKE A GOOD HUSBAND THAT
IT WOULD BE A TRYING THING TO BE HIS WIFE
I UNDERSTOOD AS BY
INSPIRATION THE NATURE OF HIS LOVE FOR MISS OLIVER I AGREED WITH HIM
THAT IT WAS BUT A LOVE OF THE SENSES
I COMPREHENDED HOW HE SHOULD
DESPISE HIMSELF FOR THE FEVERISH INFLUENCE IT EXERCISED OVER HIM HOW HE
SHOULD WISH TO STIFLE AND DESTROY IT HOW HE SHOULD MISTRUST ITS EVER
CONDUCTING PERMANENTLY TO HIS HAPPINESS OR HERS
I SAW HE WAS OF THE
MATERIAL FROM WHICH NATURE HEWS HER HEROES CHRISTIAN AND PAGAN HER
LAWGIVERS HER STATESMEN HER CONQUERORS A STEADFAST BULWARK FOR GREAT
INTERESTS TO REST UPON BUT AT THE FIRESIDE TOO OFTEN A COLD CUMBROUS
COLUMN GLOOMY AND OUT OF PLACE
THIS PARLOUR IS NOT HIS SPHERE I REFLECTED THE HIMALAYAN RIDGE OR
CAFFRE BUSH EVEN THE PLAGUE CURSED GUINEA COAST SWAMP WOULD SUIT HIM
BETTER
WELL MAY HE ESCHEW THE CALM OF DOMESTIC LIFE IT IS NOT HIS
ELEMENT THERE HIS FACULTIES STAGNATE THEY CANNOT DEVELOP OR APPEAR TO
ADVANTAGE
IT IS IN SCENES OF STRIFE AND DANGER WHERE COURAGE IS
PROVED AND ENERGY EXERCISED AND FORTITUDE TASKED THAT HE WILL SPEAK
AND MOVE THE LEADER AND SUPERIOR
A MERRY CHILD WOULD HAVE THE
ADVANTAGE OF HIM ON THIS HEARTH
HE IS RIGHT TO CHOOSE A MISSIONARY'S
CAREER I SEE IT NOW
THEY ARE COMING THEY ARE COMING CRIED HANNAH THROWING OPEN THE
PARLOUR DOOR
AT THE SAME MOMENT OLD CARLO BARKED JOYFULLY
OUT I RAN
IT WAS NOW DARK BUT A RUMBLING OF WHEELS WAS AUDIBLE
HANNAH SOON HAD A
LANTERN LIT
THE VEHICLE HAD STOPPED AT THE WICKET THE DRIVER OPENED
THE DOOR FIRST ONE WELL KNOWN FORM THEN ANOTHER STEPPED OUT
IN A
MINUTE I HAD MY FACE UNDER THEIR BONNETS IN CONTACT FIRST WITH MARY'S
SOFT CHEEK THEN WITH DIANA'S FLOWING CURLS
THEY LAUGHED KISSED
ME THEN HANNAH PATTED CARLO WHO WAS HALF WILD WITH DELIGHT ASKED
EAGERLY IF ALL WAS WELL AND BEING ASSURED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE HASTENED
INTO THE HOUSE
THEY WERE STIFF WITH THEIR LONG AND JOLTING DRIVE FROM WHITCROSS AND
CHILLED WITH THE FROSTY NIGHT AIR BUT THEIR PLEASANT COUNTENANCES
EXPANDED TO THE CHEERFUL FIRELIGHT
WHILE THE DRIVER AND HANNAH BROUGHT
IN THE BOXES THEY DEMANDED ST
JOHN
AT THIS MOMENT HE ADVANCED FROM
THE PARLOUR
THEY BOTH THREW THEIR ARMS ROUND HIS NECK AT ONCE
HE GAVE
EACH ONE QUIET KISS SAID IN A LOW TONE A FEW WORDS OF WELCOME STOOD A
WHILE TO BE TALKED TO AND THEN INTIMATING THAT HE SUPPOSED THEY WOULD
SOON REJOIN HIM IN THE PARLOUR WITHDREW THERE AS TO A PLACE OF REFUGE
I HAD LIT THEIR CANDLES TO GO UPSTAIRS BUT DIANA HAD FIRST TO GIVE
HOSPITABLE ORDERS RESPECTING THE DRIVER THIS DONE BOTH FOLLOWED ME
THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE RENOVATION AND DECORATIONS OF THEIR ROOMS
WITH THE NEW DRAPERY AND FRESH CARPETS AND RICH TINTED CHINA VASES
THEY EXPRESSED THEIR GRATIFICATION UNGRUDGINGLY
I HAD THE PLEASURE OF
FEELING THAT MY ARRANGEMENTS MET THEIR WISHES EXACTLY AND THAT WHAT I
HAD DONE ADDED A VIVID CHARM TO THEIR JOYOUS RETURN HOME
SWEET WAS THAT EVENING
MY COUSINS FULL OF EXHILARATION WERE SO
ELOQUENT IN NARRATIVE AND COMMENT THAT THEIR FLUENCY COVERED ST
JOHN'S
TACITURNITY HE WAS SINCERELY GLAD TO SEE HIS SISTERS BUT IN THEIR GLOW
OF FERVOUR AND FLOW OF JOY HE COULD NOT SYMPATHISE
THE EVENT OF THE
DAY THAT IS THE RETURN OF DIANA AND MARY PLEASED HIM BUT THE
ACCOMPANIMENTS OF THAT EVENT THE GLAD TUMULT THE GARRULOUS GLEE OF
RECEPTION IRKED HIM I SAW HE WISHED THE CALMER MORROW WAS COME
IN THE
VERY MERIDIAN OF THE NIGHT'S ENJOYMENT ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER TEA A RAP
WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR
HANNAH ENTERED WITH THE INTIMATION THAT A POOR
LAD WAS COME AT THAT UNLIKELY TIME TO FETCH MR
RIVERS TO SEE HIS
MOTHER WHO WAS DRAWING AWAY
WHERE DOES SHE LIVE HANNAH
CLEAR UP AT WHITCROSS BROW ALMOST FOUR MILES OFF AND MOOR AND MOSS ALL
THE WAY
TELL HIM I WILL GO
I'M SURE SIR YOU HAD BETTER NOT
IT'S THE WORST ROAD TO TRAVEL AFTER
DARK THAT CAN BE THERE'S NO TRACK AT ALL OVER THE BOG
AND THEN IT IS
SUCH A BITTER NIGHT THE KEENEST WIND YOU EVER FELT
YOU HAD BETTER SEND
WORD SIR THAT YOU WILL BE THERE IN THE MORNING
BUT HE WAS ALREADY IN THE PASSAGE PUTTING ON HIS CLOAK AND WITHOUT ONE
OBJECTION ONE MURMUR HE DEPARTED
IT WAS THEN NINE O'CLOCK HE DID NOT
RETURN TILL MIDNIGHT
STARVED AND TIRED ENOUGH HE WAS BUT HE LOOKED
HAPPIER THAN WHEN HE SET OUT
HE HAD PERFORMED AN ACT OF DUTY MADE AN
EXERTION FELT HIS OWN STRENGTH TO DO AND DENY AND WAS ON BETTER TERMS
WITH HIMSELF
I AM AFRAID THE WHOLE OF THE ENSUING WEEK TRIED HIS PATIENCE
IT WAS
CHRISTMAS WEEK WE TOOK TO NO SETTLED EMPLOYMENT BUT SPENT IT IN A SORT
OF MERRY DOMESTIC DISSIPATION
THE AIR OF THE MOORS THE FREEDOM OF
HOME THE DAWN OF PROSPERITY ACTED ON DIANA AND MARY'S SPIRITS LIKE SOME
LIFE GIVING ELIXIR THEY WERE GAY FROM MORNING TILL NOON AND FROM NOON
TILL NIGHT
THEY COULD ALWAYS TALK AND THEIR DISCOURSE WITTY PITHY
ORIGINAL HAD SUCH CHARMS FOR ME THAT I PREFERRED LISTENING TO AND
SHARING IN IT TO DOING ANYTHING ELSE
ST
JOHN DID NOT REBUKE OUR
VIVACITY BUT HE ESCAPED FROM IT HE WAS SELDOM IN THE HOUSE HIS PARISH
WAS LARGE THE POPULATION SCATTERED AND HE FOUND DAILY BUSINESS IN
VISITING THE SICK AND POOR IN ITS DIFFERENT DISTRICTS
ONE MORNING AT BREAKFAST DIANA AFTER LOOKING A LITTLE PENSIVE FOR SOME
MINUTES ASKED HIM IF HIS PLANS WERE YET UNCHANGED
UNCHANGED AND UNCHANGEABLE WAS THE REPLY
AND HE PROCEEDED TO INFORM
US THAT HIS DEPARTURE FROM ENGLAND WAS NOW DEFINITIVELY FIXED FOR THE
ENSUING YEAR
AND ROSAMOND OLIVER SUGGESTED MARY THE WORDS SEEMING TO ESCAPE HER
LIPS INVOLUNTARILY FOR NO SOONER HAD SHE UTTERED THEM THAN SHE MADE A
GESTURE AS IF WISHING TO RECALL THEM
ST
JOHN HAD A BOOK IN HIS HAND IT
WAS HIS UNSOCIAL CUSTOM TO READ AT MEALS HE CLOSED IT AND LOOKED UP
ROSAMOND OLIVER SAID HE IS ABOUT TO BE MARRIED TO MR
GRANBY ONE OF
THE BEST CONNECTED AND MOST ESTIMABLE RESIDENTS IN S GRANDSON AND HEIR
TO SIR FREDERIC GRANBY I HAD THE INTELLIGENCE FROM HER FATHER
YESTERDAY
HIS SISTERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND AT ME WE ALL THREE LOOKED AT HIM
HE WAS SERENE AS GLASS
THE MATCH MUST HAVE BEEN GOT UP HASTILY SAID DIANA THEY CANNOT HAVE
KNOWN EACH OTHER LONG
BUT TWO MONTHS THEY MET IN OCTOBER AT THE COUNTY BALL AT S
BUT WHERE
THERE ARE NO OBSTACLES TO A UNION AS IN THE PRESENT CASE WHERE THE
CONNECTION IS IN EVERY POINT DESIRABLE DELAYS ARE UNNECESSARY THEY WILL
BE MARRIED AS SOON AS S PLACE WHICH SIR FREDERIC GIVES UP TO THEM
CAN HE REFITTED FOR THEIR RECEPTION
THE FIRST TIME I FOUND ST
JOHN ALONE AFTER THIS COMMUNICATION I FELT
TEMPTED TO INQUIRE IF THE EVENT DISTRESSED HIM BUT HE SEEMED SO LITTLE
TO NEED SYMPATHY THAT SO FAR FROM VENTURING TO OFFER HIM MORE I
EXPERIENCED SOME SHAME AT THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT I HAD ALREADY
HAZARDED
BESIDES I WAS OUT OF PRACTICE IN TALKING TO HIM HIS RESERVE
WAS AGAIN FROZEN OVER AND MY FRANKNESS WAS CONGEALED BENEATH IT
HE HAD
NOT KEPT HIS PROMISE OF TREATING ME LIKE HIS SISTERS HE CONTINUALLY MADE
LITTLE CHILLING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US WHICH DID NOT AT ALL TEND TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF CORDIALITY IN SHORT NOW THAT I WAS ACKNOWLEDGED HIS
KINSWOMAN AND LIVED UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH HIM I FELT THE DISTANCE
BETWEEN US TO BE FAR GREATER THAN WHEN HE HAD KNOWN ME ONLY AS THE
VILLAGE SCHOOLMISTRESS
WHEN I REMEMBERED HOW FAR I HAD ONCE BEEN
ADMITTED TO HIS CONFIDENCE I COULD HARDLY COMPREHEND HIS PRESENT
FRIGIDITY
SUCH BEING THE CASE I FELT NOT A LITTLE SURPRISED WHEN HE RAISED HIS
HEAD SUDDENLY FROM THE DESK OVER WHICH HE WAS STOOPING AND SAID
YOU SEE JANE THE BATTLE IS FOUGHT AND THE VICTORY WON
STARTLED AT BEING THUS ADDRESSED I DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REPLY AFTER A
MOMENT'S HESITATION I ANSWERED
BUT ARE YOU SURE YOU ARE NOT IN THE POSITION OF THOSE CONQUERORS WHOSE
TRIUMPHS HAVE COST THEM TOO DEAR WOULD NOT SUCH ANOTHER RUIN YOU
I THINK NOT AND IF I WERE IT DOES NOT MUCH SIGNIFY I SHALL NEVER BE
CALLED UPON TO CONTEND FOR SUCH ANOTHER
THE EVENT OF THE CONFLICT IS
DECISIVE MY WAY IS NOW CLEAR I THANK GOD FOR IT SO SAYING HE
RETURNED TO HIS PAPERS AND HIS SILENCE
AS OUR MUTUAL HAPPINESS I E DIANA'S MARY'S AND MINE SETTLED INTO
A QUIETER CHARACTER AND WE RESUMED OUR USUAL HABITS AND REGULAR STUDIES
ST
JOHN STAYED MORE AT HOME HE SAT WITH US IN THE SAME ROOM SOMETIMES
FOR HOURS TOGETHER
WHILE MARY DREW DIANA PURSUED A COURSE OF
ENCYCLOPAEDIC READING SHE HAD TO MY AWE AND AMAZEMENT UNDERTAKEN AND I
FAGGED AWAY AT GERMAN HE PONDERED A MYSTIC LORE OF HIS OWN THAT OF SOME
EASTERN TONGUE THE ACQUISITION OF WHICH HE THOUGHT NECESSARY TO HIS
PLANS
THUS ENGAGED HE APPEARED SITTING IN HIS OWN RECESS QUIET AND ABSORBED
ENOUGH BUT THAT BLUE EYE OF HIS HAD A HABIT OF LEAVING THE OUTLANDISH
LOOKING GRAMMAR AND WANDERING OVER AND SOMETIMES FIXING UPON US HIS
FELLOW STUDENTS WITH A CURIOUS INTENSITY OF OBSERVATION IF CAUGHT IT
WOULD BE INSTANTLY WITHDRAWN YET EVER AND ANON IT RETURNED SEARCHINGLY
TO OUR TABLE
I WONDERED WHAT IT MEANT I WONDERED TOO AT THE PUNCTUAL
SATISFACTION HE NEVER FAILED TO EXHIBIT ON AN OCCASION THAT SEEMED TO ME
OF SMALL MOMENT NAMELY MY WEEKLY VISIT TO MORTON SCHOOL AND STILL MORE
WAS I PUZZLED WHEN IF THE DAY WAS UNFAVOURABLE IF THERE WAS SNOW OR
RAIN OR HIGH WIND AND HIS SISTERS URGED ME NOT TO GO HE WOULD
INVARIABLY MAKE LIGHT OF THEIR SOLICITUDE AND ENCOURAGE ME TO ACCOMPLISH
THE TASK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE ELEMENTS
JANE IS NOT SUCH A WEAKLING AS YOU WOULD MAKE HER HE WOULD SAY SHE
CAN BEAR A MOUNTAIN BLAST OR A SHOWER OR A FEW FLAKES OF SNOW AS WELL
AS ANY OF US
HER CONSTITUTION IS BOTH SOUND AND ELASTIC BETTER
CALCULATED TO ENDURE VARIATIONS OF CLIMATE THAN MANY MORE ROBUST
AND WHEN I RETURNED SOMETIMES A GOOD DEAL TIRED AND NOT A LITTLE
WEATHER BEATEN I NEVER DARED COMPLAIN BECAUSE I SAW THAT TO MURMUR
WOULD BE TO VEX HIM ON ALL OCCASIONS FORTITUDE PLEASED HIM THE REVERSE
WAS A SPECIAL ANNOYANCE
ONE AFTERNOON HOWEVER I GOT LEAVE TO STAY AT HOME BECAUSE I REALLY HAD
A COLD
HIS SISTERS WERE GONE TO MORTON IN MY STEAD I SAT READING
SCHILLER HE DECIPHERING HIS CRABBED ORIENTAL SCROLLS
AS I EXCHANGED A
TRANSLATION FOR AN EXERCISE I HAPPENED TO LOOK HIS WAY THERE I FOUND
MYSELF UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE EVER WATCHFUL BLUE EYE
HOW LONG IT
HAD BEEN SEARCHING ME THROUGH AND THROUGH AND OVER AND OVER I CANNOT
TELL SO KEEN WAS IT AND YET SO COLD I FELT FOR THE MOMENT
SUPERSTITIOUS AS IF I WERE SITTING IN THE ROOM WITH SOMETHING UNCANNY
JANE WHAT ARE YOU DOING
LEARNING GERMAN
I WANT YOU TO GIVE UP GERMAN AND LEARN HINDOSTANEE
YOU ARE NOT IN EARNEST
IN SUCH EARNEST THAT I MUST HAVE IT SO AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY
HE THEN WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT HINDOSTANEE WAS THE LANGUAGE HE WAS
HIMSELF AT PRESENT STUDYING THAT AS HE ADVANCED HE WAS APT TO FORGET
THE COMMENCEMENT THAT IT WOULD ASSIST HIM GREATLY TO HAVE A PUPIL WITH
WHOM HE MIGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN GO OVER THE ELEMENTS AND SO FIX THEM
THOROUGHLY IN HIS MIND THAT HIS CHOICE HAD HOVERED FOR SOME TIME BETWEEN
ME AND HIS SISTERS BUT THAT HE HAD FIXED ON ME BECAUSE HE SAW I COULD
SIT AT A TASK THE LONGEST OF THE THREE
WOULD I DO HIM THIS FAVOUR I
SHOULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE LONG AS IT WANTED NOW
BARELY THREE MONTHS TO HIS DEPARTURE
ST
JOHN WAS NOT A MAN TO BE LIGHTLY REFUSED YOU FELT THAT EVERY
IMPRESSION MADE ON HIM EITHER FOR PAIN OR PLEASURE WAS DEEP GRAVED AND
PERMANENT
I CONSENTED
WHEN DIANA AND MARY RETURNED THE FORMER FOUND
HER SCHOLAR TRANSFERRED FROM HER TO HER BROTHER SHE LAUGHED AND BOTH
SHE AND MARY AGREED THAT ST
JOHN SHOULD NEVER HAVE PERSUADED THEM TO
SUCH A STEP
HE ANSWERED QUIETLY
I KNOW IT
I FOUND HIM A VERY PATIENT VERY FORBEARING AND YET AN EXACTING MASTER
HE EXPECTED ME TO DO A GREAT DEAL AND WHEN I FULFILLED HIS EXPECTATIONS
HE IN HIS OWN WAY FULLY TESTIFIED HIS APPROBATION
BY DEGREES HE
ACQUIRED A CERTAIN INFLUENCE OVER ME THAT TOOK AWAY MY LIBERTY OF MIND
HIS PRAISE AND NOTICE WERE MORE RESTRAINING THAN HIS INDIFFERENCE
I
COULD NO LONGER TALK OR LAUGH FREELY WHEN HE WAS BY BECAUSE A TIRESOMELY
IMPORTUNATE INSTINCT REMINDED ME THAT VIVACITY AT LEAST IN ME WAS
DISTASTEFUL TO HIM
I WAS SO FULLY AWARE THAT ONLY SERIOUS MOODS AND
OCCUPATIONS WERE ACCEPTABLE THAT IN HIS PRESENCE EVERY EFFORT TO SUSTAIN
OR FOLLOW ANY OTHER BECAME VAIN I FELL UNDER A FREEZING SPELL
WHEN HE
SAID GO I WENT COME I CAME DO THIS I DID IT
BUT I DID NOT
LOVE MY SERVITUDE I WISHED MANY A TIME HE HAD CONTINUED TO NEGLECT ME
ONE EVENING WHEN AT BEDTIME HIS SISTERS AND I STOOD ROUND HIM BIDDING
HIM GOOD NIGHT HE KISSED EACH OF THEM AS WAS HIS CUSTOM AND AS WAS
EQUALLY HIS CUSTOM HE GAVE ME HIS HAND
DIANA WHO CHANCED TO BE IN A
FROLICSOME HUMOUR SHE WAS NOT PAINFULLY CONTROLLED BY HIS WILL FOR
HERS IN ANOTHER WAY WAS AS STRONG EXCLAIMED
ST
JOHN YOU USED TO CALL JANE YOUR THIRD SISTER BUT YOU DON'T TREAT
HER AS SUCH YOU SHOULD KISS HER TOO
SHE PUSHED ME TOWARDS HIM
I THOUGHT DIANA VERY PROVOKING AND FELT
UNCOMFORTABLY CONFUSED AND WHILE I WAS THUS THINKING AND FEELING ST
JOHN BENT HIS HEAD HIS GREEK FACE WAS BROUGHT TO A LEVEL WITH MINE HIS
EYES QUESTIONED MY EYES PIERCINGLY HE KISSED ME
THERE ARE NO SUCH
THINGS AS MARBLE KISSES OR ICE KISSES OR I SHOULD SAY MY ECCLESIASTICAL
COUSIN'S SALUTE BELONGED TO ONE OF THESE CLASSES BUT THERE MAY BE
EXPERIMENT KISSES AND HIS WAS AN EXPERIMENT KISS
WHEN GIVEN HE VIEWED
ME TO LEARN THE RESULT IT WAS NOT STRIKING I AM SURE I DID NOT BLUSH
PERHAPS I MIGHT HAVE TURNED A LITTLE PALE FOR I FELT AS IF THIS KISS
WERE A SEAL AFFIXED TO MY FETTERS
HE NEVER OMITTED THE CEREMONY
AFTERWARDS AND THE GRAVITY AND QUIESCENCE WITH WHICH I UNDERWENT IT
SEEMED TO INVEST IT FOR HIM WITH A CERTAIN CHARM
AS FOR ME I DAILY WISHED MORE TO PLEASE HIM BUT TO DO SO I FELT DAILY
MORE AND MORE THAT I MUST DISOWN HALF MY NATURE STIFLE HALF MY
FACULTIES WREST MY TASTES FROM THEIR ORIGINAL BENT FORCE MYSELF TO THE
ADOPTION OF PURSUITS FOR WHICH I HAD NO NATURAL VOCATION
HE WANTED TO
TRAIN ME TO AN ELEVATION I COULD NEVER REACH IT RACKED ME HOURLY TO
ASPIRE TO THE STANDARD HE UPLIFTED
THE THING WAS AS IMPOSSIBLE AS TO
MOULD MY IRREGULAR FEATURES TO HIS CORRECT AND CLASSIC PATTERN TO GIVE
TO MY CHANGEABLE GREEN EYES THE SEA BLUE TINT AND SOLEMN LUSTRE OF HIS
OWN
NOT HIS ASCENDANCY ALONE HOWEVER HELD ME IN THRALL AT PRESENT
OF LATE
IT HAD BEEN EASY ENOUGH FOR ME TO LOOK SAD A CANKERING EVIL SAT AT MY
HEART AND DRAINED MY HAPPINESS AT ITS SOURCE THE EVIL OF SUSPENSE
PERHAPS YOU THINK I HAD FORGOTTEN MR
ROCHESTER READER AMIDST THESE
CHANGES OF PLACE AND FORTUNE
NOT FOR A MOMENT
HIS IDEA WAS STILL WITH
ME BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A VAPOUR SUNSHINE COULD DISPERSE NOR A
SAND TRACED EFFIGY STORMS COULD WASH AWAY IT WAS A NAME GRAVEN ON A
TABLET FATED TO LAST AS LONG AS THE MARBLE IT INSCRIBED
THE CRAVING TO
KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM FOLLOWED ME EVERYWHERE WHEN I WAS AT MORTON
I RE ENTERED MY COTTAGE EVERY EVENING TO THINK OF THAT AND NOW AT MOOR
HOUSE I SOUGHT MY BEDROOM EACH NIGHT TO BROOD OVER IT
IN THE COURSE OF MY NECESSARY CORRESPONDENCE WITH MR
BRIGGS ABOUT THE
WILL I HAD INQUIRED IF HE KNEW ANYTHING OF MR
ROCHESTER'S PRESENT
RESIDENCE AND STATE OF HEALTH BUT AS ST
JOHN HAD CONJECTURED HE WAS
QUITE IGNORANT OF ALL CONCERNING HIM
I THEN WROTE TO MRS
FAIRFAX
ENTREATING INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT
I HAD CALCULATED WITH CERTAINTY
ON THIS STEP ANSWERING MY END I FELT SURE IT WOULD ELICIT AN EARLY
ANSWER
I WAS ASTONISHED WHEN A FORTNIGHT PASSED WITHOUT REPLY BUT WHEN
TWO MONTHS WORE AWAY AND DAY AFTER DAY THE POST ARRIVED AND BROUGHT
NOTHING FOR ME I FELL A PREY TO THE KEENEST ANXIETY
I WROTE AGAIN THERE WAS A CHANCE OF MY FIRST LETTER HAVING MISSED
RENEWED HOPE FOLLOWED RENEWED EFFORT IT SHONE LIKE THE FORMER FOR SOME
WEEKS THEN LIKE IT IT FADED FLICKERED NOT A LINE NOT A WORD REACHED
ME
WHEN HALF A YEAR WASTED IN VAIN EXPECTANCY MY HOPE DIED OUT AND
THEN I FELT DARK INDEED
A FINE SPRING SHONE ROUND ME WHICH I COULD NOT ENJOY
SUMMER
APPROACHED DIANA TRIED TO CHEER ME SHE SAID I LOOKED ILL AND WISHED TO
ACCOMPANY ME TO THE SEA SIDE
THIS ST
JOHN OPPOSED HE SAID I DID NOT
WANT DISSIPATION I WANTED EMPLOYMENT MY PRESENT LIFE WAS TOO
PURPOSELESS I REQUIRED AN AIM AND I SUPPOSE BY WAY OF SUPPLYING
DEFICIENCIES HE PROLONGED STILL FURTHER MY LESSONS IN HINDOSTANEE AND
GREW MORE URGENT IN REQUIRING THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT AND I LIKE A FOOL
NEVER THOUGHT OF RESISTING HIM I COULD NOT RESIST HIM
ONE DAY I HAD COME TO MY STUDIES IN LOWER SPIRITS THAN USUAL THE EBB WAS
OCCASIONED BY A POIGNANTLY FELT DISAPPOINTMENT
HANNAH HAD TOLD ME IN
THE MORNING THERE WAS A LETTER FOR ME AND WHEN I WENT DOWN TO TAKE IT
ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THE LONG LOOKED FOR TIDINGS WERE VOUCHSAFED ME AT
LAST I FOUND ONLY AN UNIMPORTANT NOTE FROM MR
BRIGGS ON BUSINESS
THE
BITTER CHECK HAD WRUNG FROM ME SOME TEARS AND NOW AS I SAT PORING OVER
THE CRABBED CHARACTERS AND FLOURISHING TROPES OF AN INDIAN SCRIBE MY
EYES FILLED AGAIN
ST
JOHN CALLED ME TO HIS SIDE TO READ IN ATTEMPTING TO DO THIS MY VOICE
FAILED ME WORDS WERE LOST IN SOBS
HE AND I WERE THE ONLY OCCUPANTS OF
THE PARLOUR DIANA WAS PRACTISING HER MUSIC IN THE DRAWING ROOM MARY WAS
GARDENING IT WAS A VERY FINE MAY DAY CLEAR SUNNY AND BREEZY
MY
COMPANION EXPRESSED NO SURPRISE AT THIS EMOTION NOR DID HE QUESTION ME
AS TO ITS CAUSE HE ONLY SAID
WE WILL WAIT A FEW MINUTES JANE TILL YOU ARE MORE COMPOSED AND
WHILE I SMOTHERED THE PAROXYSM WITH ALL HASTE HE SAT CALM AND PATIENT
LEANING ON HIS DESK AND LOOKING LIKE A PHYSICIAN WATCHING WITH THE EYE
OF SCIENCE AN EXPECTED AND FULLY UNDERSTOOD CRISIS IN A PATIENT'S MALADY
HAVING STIFLED MY SOBS WIPED MY EYES AND MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT NOT
BEING VERY WELL THAT MORNING I RESUMED MY TASK AND SUCCEEDED IN
COMPLETING IT
ST
JOHN PUT AWAY MY BOOKS AND HIS LOCKED HIS DESK AND
SAID
NOW JANE YOU SHALL TAKE A WALK AND WITH ME
I WILL CALL DIANA AND MARY
NO I WANT ONLY ONE COMPANION THIS MORNING AND THAT MUST BE YOU
PUT
ON YOUR THINGS GO OUT BY THE KITCHEN DOOR TAKE THE ROAD TOWARDS THE
HEAD OF MARSH GLEN I WILL JOIN YOU IN A MOMENT
I KNOW NO MEDIUM I NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE KNOWN ANY MEDIUM IN MY DEALINGS
WITH POSITIVE HARD CHARACTERS ANTAGONISTIC TO MY OWN BETWEEN ABSOLUTE
SUBMISSION AND DETERMINED REVOLT
I HAVE ALWAYS FAITHFULLY OBSERVED THE
ONE UP TO THE VERY MOMENT OF BURSTING SOMETIMES WITH VOLCANIC
VEHEMENCE INTO THE OTHER AND AS NEITHER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
WARRANTED NOR MY PRESENT MOOD INCLINED ME TO MUTINY I OBSERVED CAREFUL
OBEDIENCE TO ST
JOHN'S DIRECTIONS AND IN TEN MINUTES I WAS TREADING THE
WILD TRACK OF THE GLEN SIDE BY SIDE WITH HIM
THE BREEZE WAS FROM THE WEST IT CAME OVER THE HILLS SWEET WITH SCENTS
OF HEATH AND RUSH THE SKY WAS OF STAINLESS BLUE THE STREAM DESCENDING
THE RAVINE SWELLED WITH PAST SPRING RAINS POURED ALONG PLENTIFUL AND
CLEAR CATCHING GOLDEN GLEAMS FROM THE SUN AND SAPPHIRE TINTS FROM THE
FIRMAMENT
AS WE ADVANCED AND LEFT THE TRACK WE TROD A SOFT TURF MOSSY
FINE AND EMERALD GREEN MINUTELY ENAMELLED WITH A TINY WHITE FLOWER AND
SPANGLED WITH A STAR LIKE YELLOW BLOSSOM THE HILLS MEANTIME SHUT US
QUITE IN FOR THE GLEN TOWARDS ITS HEAD WOUND TO THEIR VERY CORE
LET US REST HERE SAID ST
JOHN AS WE REACHED THE FIRST STRAGGLERS OF
A BATTALION OF ROCKS GUARDING A SORT OF PASS BEYOND WHICH THE BECK
RUSHED DOWN A WATERFALL AND WHERE STILL A LITTLE FARTHER THE MOUNTAIN
SHOOK OFF TURF AND FLOWER HAD ONLY HEATH FOR RAIMENT AND CRAG FOR
GEM WHERE IT EXAGGERATED THE WILD TO THE SAVAGE AND EXCHANGED THE FRESH
FOR THE FROWNING WHERE IT GUARDED THE FORLORN HOPE OF SOLITUDE AND A
LAST REFUGE FOR SILENCE
I TOOK A SEAT ST
JOHN STOOD NEAR ME
HE LOOKED UP THE PASS AND DOWN
THE HOLLOW HIS GLANCE WANDERED AWAY WITH THE STREAM AND RETURNED TO
TRAVERSE THE UNCLOUDED HEAVEN WHICH COLOURED IT HE REMOVED HIS HAT LET
THE BREEZE STIR HIS HAIR AND KISS HIS BROW
HE SEEMED IN COMMUNION WITH
THE GENIUS OF THE HAUNT WITH HIS EYE HE BADE FAREWELL TO SOMETHING
AND I SHALL SEE IT AGAIN HE SAID ALOUD IN DREAMS WHEN I SLEEP BY THE
GANGES AND AGAIN IN A MORE REMOTE HOUR WHEN ANOTHER SLUMBER OVERCOMES
ME ON THE SHORE OF A DARKER STREAM
STRANGE WORDS OF A STRANGE LOVE AN AUSTERE PATRIOT'S PASSION FOR HIS
FATHERLAND HE SAT DOWN FOR HALF AN HOUR WE NEVER SPOKE NEITHER HE TO
ME NOR I TO HIM THAT INTERVAL PAST HE RECOMMENCED
JANE I GO IN SIX WEEKS I HAVE TAKEN MY BERTH IN AN EAST INDIAMAN WHICH
SAILS ON THE 20TH OF JUNE
GOD WILL PROTECT YOU FOR YOU HAVE UNDERTAKEN HIS WORK I ANSWERED
YES SAID HE THERE IS MY GLORY AND JOY
I AM THE SERVANT OF AN
INFALLIBLE MASTER
I AM NOT GOING OUT UNDER HUMAN GUIDANCE SUBJECT TO
THE DEFECTIVE LAWS AND ERRING CONTROL OF MY FEEBLE FELLOW WORMS MY KING
MY LAWGIVER MY CAPTAIN IS THE ALL PERFECT
IT SEEMS STRANGE TO ME THAT
ALL ROUND ME DO NOT BURN TO ENLIST UNDER THE SAME BANNER TO JOIN IN THE
SAME ENTERPRISE
ALL HAVE NOT YOUR POWERS AND IT WOULD BE FOLLY FOR THE FEEBLE TO WISH
TO MARCH WITH THE STRONG
I DO NOT SPEAK TO THE FEEBLE OR THINK OF THEM I ADDRESS ONLY SUCH AS
ARE WORTHY OF THE WORK AND COMPETENT TO ACCOMPLISH IT
THOSE ARE FEW IN NUMBER AND DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER
YOU SAY TRULY BUT WHEN FOUND IT IS RIGHT TO STIR THEM UP TO URGE AND
EXHORT THEM TO THE EFFORT TO SHOW THEM WHAT THEIR GIFTS ARE AND WHY
THEY WERE GIVEN TO SPEAK HEAVEN'S MESSAGE IN THEIR EAR TO OFFER THEM
DIRECT FROM GOD A PLACE IN THE RANKS OF HIS CHOSEN
IF THEY ARE REALLY QUALIFIED FOR THE TASK WILL NOT THEIR OWN HEARTS BE
THE FIRST TO INFORM THEM OF IT
I FELT AS IF AN AWFUL CHARM WAS FRAMING ROUND AND GATHERING OVER ME I
TREMBLED TO HEAR SOME FATAL WORD SPOKEN WHICH WOULD AT ONCE DECLARE AND
RIVET THE SPELL
AND WHAT DOES YOUR HEART SAY DEMANDED ST
JOHN
MY HEART IS MUTE MY HEART IS MUTE I ANSWERED STRUCK AND THRILLED
THEN I MUST SPEAK FOR IT CONTINUED THE DEEP RELENTLESS VOICE
JANE
COME WITH ME TO INDIA COME AS MY HELPMEET AND FELLOW LABOURER
THE GLEN AND SKY SPUN ROUND THE HILLS HEAVED IT WAS AS IF I HAD HEARD
A SUMMONS FROM HEAVEN AS IF A VISIONARY MESSENGER LIKE HIM OF
MACEDONIA HAD ENOUNCED COME OVER AND HELP US BUT I WAS NO
APOSTLE I COULD NOT BEHOLD THE HERALD I COULD NOT RECEIVE HIS CALL
OH ST
JOHN I CRIED HAVE SOME MERCY
I APPEALED TO ONE WHO IN THE DISCHARGE OF WHAT HE BELIEVED HIS DUTY
KNEW NEITHER MERCY NOR REMORSE
HE CONTINUED
GOD AND NATURE INTENDED YOU FOR A MISSIONARY'S WIFE
IT IS NOT
PERSONAL BUT MENTAL ENDOWMENTS THEY HAVE GIVEN YOU YOU ARE FORMED FOR
LABOUR NOT FOR LOVE
A MISSIONARY'S WIFE YOU MUST SHALL BE
YOU SHALL
BE MINE I CLAIM YOU NOT FOR MY PLEASURE BUT FOR MY SOVEREIGN'S
SERVICE
I AM NOT FIT FOR IT I HAVE NO VOCATION I SAID
HE HAD CALCULATED ON THESE FIRST OBJECTIONS HE WAS NOT IRRITATED BY
THEM
INDEED AS HE LEANED BACK AGAINST THE CRAG BEHIND HIM FOLDED HIS
ARMS ON HIS CHEST AND FIXED HIS COUNTENANCE I SAW HE WAS PREPARED FOR A
LONG AND TRYING OPPOSITION AND HAD TAKEN IN A STOCK OF PATIENCE TO LAST
HIM TO ITS CLOSE RESOLVED HOWEVER THAT THAT CLOSE SHOULD BE CONQUEST
FOR HIM
HUMILITY JANE SAID HE IS THE GROUNDWORK OF CHRISTIAN VIRTUES YOU
SAY RIGHT THAT YOU ARE NOT FIT FOR THE WORK
WHO IS FIT FOR IT OR WHO
THAT EVER WAS TRULY CALLED BELIEVED HIMSELF WORTHY OF THE SUMMONS I
FOR INSTANCE AM BUT DUST AND ASHES
WITH ST
PAUL I ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF
THE CHIEFEST OF SINNERS BUT I DO NOT SUFFER THIS SENSE OF MY PERSONAL
VILENESS TO DAUNT ME
I KNOW MY LEADER THAT HE IS JUST AS WELL AS
MIGHTY AND WHILE HE HAS CHOSEN A FEEBLE INSTRUMENT TO PERFORM A GREAT
TASK HE WILL FROM THE BOUNDLESS STORES OF HIS PROVIDENCE SUPPLY THE
INADEQUACY OF THE MEANS TO THE END
THINK LIKE ME JANE TRUST LIKE ME
IT IS THE ROCK OF AGES I ASK YOU TO LEAN ON DO NOT DOUBT BUT IT WILL
BEAR THE WEIGHT OF YOUR HUMAN WEAKNESS
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND A MISSIONARY LIFE I HAVE NEVER STUDIED MISSIONARY
LABOURS
THERE I HUMBLE AS I AM CAN GIVE YOU THE AID YOU WANT I CAN SET YOU
YOUR TASK FROM HOUR TO HOUR STAND BY YOU ALWAYS HELP YOU FROM MOMENT TO
MOMENT
THIS I COULD DO IN THE BEGINNING SOON FOR I KNOW YOUR POWERS
YOU WOULD BE AS STRONG AND APT AS MYSELF AND WOULD NOT REQUIRE MY HELP
BUT MY POWERS WHERE ARE THEY FOR THIS UNDERTAKING I DO NOT FEEL THEM
NOTHING SPEAKS OR STIRS IN ME WHILE YOU TALK
I AM SENSIBLE OF NO LIGHT
KINDLING NO LIFE QUICKENING NO VOICE COUNSELLING OR CHEERING
OH I
WISH I COULD MAKE YOU SEE HOW MUCH MY MIND IS AT THIS MOMENT LIKE A
RAYLESS DUNGEON WITH ONE SHRINKING FEAR FETTERED IN ITS DEPTHS THE FEAR
OF BEING PERSUADED BY YOU TO ATTEMPT WHAT I CANNOT ACCOMPLISH
I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU HEAR IT
I HAVE WATCHED YOU EVER SINCE WE
FIRST MET I HAVE MADE YOU MY STUDY FOR TEN MONTHS
I HAVE PROVED YOU IN
THAT TIME BY SUNDRY TESTS AND WHAT HAVE I SEEN AND ELICITED IN THE
VILLAGE SCHOOL I FOUND YOU COULD PERFORM WELL PUNCTUALLY UPRIGHTLY
LABOUR UNCONGENIAL TO YOUR HABITS AND INCLINATIONS I SAW YOU COULD
PERFORM IT WITH CAPACITY AND TACT YOU COULD WIN WHILE YOU CONTROLLED
IN
THE CALM WITH WHICH YOU LEARNT YOU HAD BECOME SUDDENLY RICH I READ A
MIND CLEAR OF THE VICE OF DEMAS LUCRE HAD NO UNDUE POWER OVER YOU
IN
THE RESOLUTE READINESS WITH WHICH YOU CUT YOUR WEALTH INTO FOUR SHARES
KEEPING BUT ONE TO YOURSELF AND RELINQUISHING THE THREE OTHERS TO THE
CLAIM OF ABSTRACT JUSTICE I RECOGNISED A SOUL THAT REVELLED IN THE FLAME
AND EXCITEMENT OF SACRIFICE
IN THE TRACTABILITY WITH WHICH AT MY WISH
YOU FORSOOK A STUDY IN WHICH YOU WERE INTERESTED AND ADOPTED ANOTHER
BECAUSE IT INTERESTED ME IN THE UNTIRING ASSIDUITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE
SINCE PERSEVERED IN IT IN THE UNFLAGGING ENERGY AND UNSHAKEN TEMPER WITH
WHICH YOU HAVE MET ITS DIFFICULTIES I ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMPLEMENT OF THE
QUALITIES I SEEK
JANE YOU ARE DOCILE DILIGENT DISINTERESTED
FAITHFUL CONSTANT AND COURAGEOUS VERY GENTLE AND VERY HEROIC CEASE
TO MISTRUST YOURSELF I CAN TRUST YOU UNRESERVEDLY
AS A CONDUCTRESS OF
INDIAN SCHOOLS AND A HELPER AMONGST INDIAN WOMEN YOUR ASSISTANCE WILL
BE TO ME INVALUABLE
MY IRON SHROUD CONTRACTED ROUND ME PERSUASION ADVANCED WITH SLOW SURE
STEP
SHUT MY EYES AS I WOULD THESE LAST WORDS OF HIS SUCCEEDED IN
MAKING THE WAY WHICH HAD SEEMED BLOCKED UP COMPARATIVELY CLEAR
MY
WORK WHICH HAD APPEARED SO VAGUE SO HOPELESSLY DIFFUSE CONDENSED
ITSELF AS HE PROCEEDED AND ASSUMED A DEFINITE FORM UNDER HIS SHAPING
HAND
HE WAITED FOR AN ANSWER
I DEMANDED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO
THINK BEFORE I AGAIN HAZARDED A REPLY
VERY WILLINGLY HE REJOINED AND RISING HE STRODE A LITTLE DISTANCE UP
THE PASS THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON A SWELL OF HEATH AND THERE LAY STILL
HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON A SWELL OF HEATH AND THERE LAY STILL
P389 JPG
I CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS ME TO DO I AM FORCED TO SEE AND ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT I MEDITATED THAT IS IF LIFE BE SPARED ME
BUT I FEEL MINE IS
NOT THE EXISTENCE TO BE LONG PROTRACTED UNDER AN INDIAN SUN
WHAT THEN
HE DOES NOT CARE FOR THAT WHEN MY TIME CAME TO DIE HE WOULD RESIGN ME
IN ALL SERENITY AND SANCTITY TO THE GOD WHO GAVE ME
THE CASE IS VERY
PLAIN BEFORE ME
IN LEAVING ENGLAND I SHOULD LEAVE A LOVED BUT EMPTY
LAND MR
ROCHESTER IS NOT THERE AND IF HE WERE WHAT IS WHAT CAN THAT
EVER BE TO ME MY BUSINESS IS TO LIVE WITHOUT HIM NOW NOTHING SO
ABSURD SO WEAK AS TO DRAG ON FROM DAY TO DAY AS IF I WERE WAITING SOME
IMPOSSIBLE CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MIGHT REUNITE ME TO HIM
OF
COURSE AS ST
JOHN ONCE SAID I MUST SEEK ANOTHER INTEREST IN LIFE TO
REPLACE THE ONE LOST IS NOT THE OCCUPATION HE NOW OFFERS ME TRULY THE
MOST GLORIOUS MAN CAN ADOPT OR GOD ASSIGN IS IT NOT BY ITS NOBLE CARES
AND SUBLIME RESULTS THE ONE BEST CALCULATED TO FILL THE VOID LEFT BY
UPTORN AFFECTIONS AND DEMOLISHED HOPES I BELIEVE I MUST SAY YES AND
YET I SHUDDER
ALAS IF I JOIN ST
JOHN I ABANDON HALF MYSELF IF I GO
TO INDIA I GO TO PREMATURE DEATH
AND HOW WILL THE INTERVAL BETWEEN
LEAVING ENGLAND FOR INDIA AND INDIA FOR THE GRAVE BE FILLED OH I
KNOW WELL THAT TOO IS VERY CLEAR TO MY VISION
BY STRAINING TO
SATISFY ST
JOHN TILL MY SINEWS ACHE I SHALL SATISFY HIM TO THE
FINEST CENTRAL POINT AND FARTHEST OUTWARD CIRCLE OF HIS EXPECTATIONS
IF
I DO GO WITH HIM IF I DO MAKE THE SACRIFICE HE URGES I WILL MAKE IT
ABSOLUTELY I WILL THROW ALL ON THE ALTAR HEART VITALS THE ENTIRE
VICTIM
HE WILL NEVER LOVE ME BUT HE SHALL APPROVE ME I WILL SHOW HIM
ENERGIES HE HAS NOT YET SEEN RESOURCES HE HAS NEVER SUSPECTED
YES I
CAN WORK AS HARD AS HE CAN AND WITH AS LITTLE GRUDGING
CONSENT THEN TO HIS DEMAND IS POSSIBLE BUT FOR ONE ITEM ONE DREADFUL
ITEM
IT IS THAT HE ASKS ME TO BE HIS WIFE AND HAS NO MORE OF A
HUSBAND'S HEART FOR ME THAN THAT FROWNING GIANT OF A ROCK DOWN WHICH THE
STREAM IS FOAMING IN YONDER GORGE
HE PRIZES ME AS A SOLDIER WOULD A
GOOD WEAPON AND THAT IS ALL
UNMARRIED TO HIM THIS WOULD NEVER GRIEVE
ME BUT CAN I LET HIM COMPLETE HIS CALCULATIONS COOLLY PUT INTO PRACTICE
HIS PLANS GO THROUGH THE WEDDING CEREMONY CAN I RECEIVE FROM HIM THE
BRIDAL RING ENDURE ALL THE FORMS OF LOVE WHICH I DOUBT NOT HE WOULD
SCRUPULOUSLY OBSERVE AND KNOW THAT THE SPIRIT WAS QUITE ABSENT CAN I
BEAR THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT EVERY ENDEARMENT HE BESTOWS IS A SACRIFICE
MADE ON PRINCIPLE NO SUCH A MARTYRDOM WOULD BE MONSTROUS
I WILL
NEVER UNDERGO IT
AS HIS SISTER I MIGHT ACCOMPANY HIM NOT AS HIS WIFE
I WILL TELL HIM SO
I LOOKED TOWARDS THE KNOLL THERE HE LAY STILL AS A PROSTRATE COLUMN
HIS FACE TURNED TO ME HIS EYE BEAMING WATCHFUL AND KEEN
HE STARTED TO
HIS FEET AND APPROACHED ME
I AM READY TO GO TO INDIA IF I MAY GO FREE
YOUR ANSWER REQUIRES A COMMENTARY HE SAID IT IS NOT CLEAR
YOU HAVE HITHERTO BEEN MY ADOPTED BROTHER I YOUR ADOPTED SISTER LET
US CONTINUE AS SUCH YOU AND I HAD BETTER NOT MARRY
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
ADOPTED FRATERNITY WILL NOT DO IN THIS CASE
IF YOU
WERE MY REAL SISTER IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT I SHOULD TAKE YOU AND SEEK NO
WIFE
BUT AS IT IS EITHER OUR UNION MUST BE CONSECRATED AND SEALED BY
MARRIAGE OR IT CANNOT EXIST PRACTICAL OBSTACLES OPPOSE THEMSELVES TO
ANY OTHER PLAN
DO YOU NOT SEE IT JANE CONSIDER A MOMENT YOUR STRONG
SENSE WILL GUIDE YOU
I DID CONSIDER AND STILL MY SENSE SUCH AS IT WAS DIRECTED ME ONLY TO
THE FACT THAT WE DID NOT LOVE EACH OTHER AS MAN AND WIFE SHOULD AND
THEREFORE IT INFERRED WE OUGHT NOT TO MARRY
I SAID SO
ST
JOHN I
RETURNED I REGARD YOU AS A BROTHER YOU ME AS A SISTER SO LET US
CONTINUE
WE CANNOT WE CANNOT HE ANSWERED WITH SHORT SHARP DETERMINATION IT
WOULD NOT DO
YOU HAVE SAID YOU WILL GO WITH ME TO INDIA REMEMBER YOU
HAVE SAID THAT
CONDITIONALLY
WELL WELL
TO THE MAIN POINT THE DEPARTURE WITH ME FROM ENGLAND THE
CO OPERATION WITH ME IN MY FUTURE LABOURS YOU DO NOT OBJECT
YOU HAVE
ALREADY AS GOOD AS PUT YOUR HAND TO THE PLOUGH YOU ARE TOO CONSISTENT TO
WITHDRAW IT
YOU HAVE BUT ONE END TO KEEP IN VIEW HOW THE WORK YOU HAVE
UNDERTAKEN CAN BEST BE DONE
SIMPLIFY YOUR COMPLICATED INTERESTS
FEELINGS THOUGHTS WISHES AIMS MERGE ALL CONSIDERATIONS IN ONE
PURPOSE THAT OF FULFILLING WITH EFFECT WITH POWER THE MISSION OF YOUR
GREAT MASTER
TO DO SO YOU MUST HAVE A COADJUTOR NOT A BROTHER THAT
IS A LOOSE TIE BUT A HUSBAND
I TOO DO NOT WANT A SISTER A SISTER
MIGHT ANY DAY BE TAKEN FROM ME
I WANT A WIFE THE SOLE HELPMEET I CAN
INFLUENCE EFFICIENTLY IN LIFE AND RETAIN ABSOLUTELY TILL DEATH
I SHUDDERED AS HE SPOKE I FELT HIS INFLUENCE IN MY MARROW HIS HOLD ON
MY LIMBS
SEEK ONE ELSEWHERE THAN IN ME ST
JOHN SEEK ONE FITTED TO YOU
ONE FITTED TO MY PURPOSE YOU MEAN FITTED TO MY VOCATION
AGAIN I TELL
YOU IT IS NOT THE INSIGNIFICANT PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL THE MERE MAN WITH
THE MAN'S SELFISH SENSES I WISH TO MATE IT IS THE MISSIONARY
AND I WILL GIVE THE MISSIONARY MY ENERGIES IT IS ALL HE WANTS BUT NOT
MYSELF THAT WOULD BE ONLY ADDING THE HUSK AND SHELL TO THE KERNEL
FOR
THEM HE HAS NO USE I RETAIN THEM
YOU CANNOT YOU OUGHT NOT
DO YOU THINK GOD WILL BE SATISFIED WITH HALF
AN OBLATION WILL HE ACCEPT A MUTILATED SACRIFICE IT IS THE CAUSE OF
GOD I ADVOCATE IT IS UNDER HIS STANDARD I ENLIST YOU
I CANNOT ACCEPT
ON HIS BEHALF A DIVIDED ALLEGIANCE IT MUST BE ENTIRE
OH I WILL GIVE MY HEART TO GOD I SAID
YOU DO NOT WANT IT
I WILL NOT SWEAR READER THAT THERE WAS NOT SOMETHING OF REPRESSED
SARCASM BOTH IN THE TONE IN WHICH I UTTERED THIS SENTENCE AND IN THE
FEELING THAT ACCOMPANIED IT
I HAD SILENTLY FEARED ST
JOHN TILL NOW
BECAUSE I HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD HIM
HE HAD HELD ME IN AWE BECAUSE HE HAD
HELD ME IN DOUBT
HOW MUCH OF HIM WAS SAINT HOW MUCH MORTAL I COULD
NOT HERETOFORE TELL BUT REVELATIONS WERE BEING MADE IN THIS CONFERENCE
THE ANALYSIS OF HIS NATURE WAS PROCEEDING BEFORE MY EYES
I SAW HIS
FALLIBILITIES I COMPREHENDED THEM
I UNDERSTOOD THAT SITTING THERE
WHERE I DID ON THE BANK OF HEATH AND WITH THAT HANDSOME FORM BEFORE ME
I SAT AT THE FEET OF A MAN CARING AS I
THE VEIL FELL FROM HIS HARDNESS
AND DESPOTISM
HAVING FELT IN HIM THE PRESENCE OF THESE QUALITIES I
FELT HIS IMPERFECTION AND TOOK COURAGE
I WAS WITH AN EQUAL ONE WITH
WHOM I MIGHT ARGUE ONE WHOM IF I SAW GOOD I MIGHT RESIST
HE WAS SILENT AFTER I HAD UTTERED THE LAST SENTENCE AND I PRESENTLY
RISKED AN UPWARD GLANCE AT HIS COUNTENANCE
HIS EYE BENT ON ME EXPRESSED AT ONCE STERN SURPRISE AND KEEN INQUIRY
IS SHE SARCASTIC AND SARCASTIC TO ME IT SEEMED TO SAY
WHAT DOES
THIS SIGNIFY
DO NOT LET US FORGET THAT THIS IS A SOLEMN MATTER HE SAID ERE LONG
ONE OF WHICH WE MAY NEITHER THINK NOR TALK LIGHTLY WITHOUT SIN
I
TRUST JANE YOU ARE IN EARNEST WHEN YOU SAY YOU WILL SERVE YOUR HEART TO
GOD IT IS ALL I WANT
ONCE WRENCH YOUR HEART FROM MAN AND FIX IT ON
YOUR MAKER THE ADVANCEMENT OF THAT MAKER'S SPIRITUAL KINGDOM ON EARTH
WILL BE YOUR CHIEF DELIGHT AND ENDEAVOUR YOU WILL BE READY TO DO AT ONCE
WHATEVER FURTHERS THAT END
YOU WILL SEE WHAT IMPETUS WOULD BE GIVEN TO
YOUR EFFORTS AND MINE BY OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL UNION IN MARRIAGE THE
ONLY UNION THAT GIVES A CHARACTER OF PERMANENT CONFORMITY TO THE
DESTINIES AND DESIGNS OF HUMAN BEINGS AND PASSING OVER ALL MINOR
CAPRICES ALL TRIVIAL DIFFICULTIES AND DELICACIES OF FEELING ALL SCRUPLE
ABOUT THE DEGREE KIND STRENGTH OR TENDERNESS OF MERE PERSONAL
INCLINATION YOU WILL HASTEN TO ENTER INTO THAT UNION AT ONCE
SHALL I I SAID BRIEFLY AND I LOOKED AT HIS FEATURES BEAUTIFUL IN
THEIR HARMONY BUT STRANGELY FORMIDABLE IN THEIR STILL SEVERITY AT HIS
BROW COMMANDING BUT NOT OPEN AT HIS EYES BRIGHT AND DEEP AND
SEARCHING BUT NEVER SOFT AT HIS TALL IMPOSING FIGURE AND FANCIED
MYSELF IN IDEA HIS WIFE
OH IT WOULD NEVER DO AS HIS CURATE HIS
COMRADE ALL WOULD BE RIGHT I WOULD CROSS OCEANS WITH HIM IN THAT
CAPACITY TOIL UNDER EASTERN SUNS IN ASIAN DESERTS WITH HIM IN THAT
OFFICE ADMIRE AND EMULATE HIS COURAGE AND DEVOTION AND VIGOUR
ACCOMMODATE QUIETLY TO HIS MASTERHOOD SMILE UNDISTURBED AT HIS
INERADICABLE AMBITION DISCRIMINATE THE CHRISTIAN FROM THE MAN
PROFOUNDLY ESTEEM THE ONE AND FREELY FORGIVE THE OTHER
I SHOULD SUFFER
OFTEN NO DOUBT ATTACHED TO HIM ONLY IN THIS CAPACITY MY BODY WOULD BE
UNDER RATHER A STRINGENT YOKE BUT MY HEART AND MIND WOULD BE FREE
I
SHOULD STILL HAVE MY UNBLIGHTED SELF TO TURN TO MY NATURAL UNENSLAVED
FEELINGS WITH WHICH TO COMMUNICATE IN MOMENTS OF LONELINESS
THERE WOULD
BE RECESSES IN MY MIND WHICH WOULD BE ONLY MINE TO WHICH HE NEVER CAME
AND SENTIMENTS GROWING THERE FRESH AND SHELTERED WHICH HIS AUSTERITY
COULD NEVER BLIGHT NOR HIS MEASURED WARRIOR MARCH TRAMPLE DOWN BUT AS
HIS WIFE AT HIS SIDE ALWAYS AND ALWAYS RESTRAINED AND ALWAYS
CHECKED FORCED TO KEEP THE FIRE OF MY NATURE CONTINUALLY LOW TO COMPEL
IT TO BURN INWARDLY AND NEVER UTTER A CRY THOUGH THE IMPRISONED FLAME
CONSUMED VITAL AFTER VITAL THIS WOULD BE UNENDURABLE
ST
JOHN I EXCLAIMED WHEN I HAD GOT SO FAR IN MY MEDITATION
WELL HE ANSWERED ICILY
I REPEAT I FREELY CONSENT TO GO WITH YOU AS YOUR FELLOW MISSIONARY BUT
NOT AS YOUR WIFE I CANNOT MARRY YOU AND BECOME PART OF YOU
A PART OF ME YOU MUST BECOME HE ANSWERED STEADILY OTHERWISE THE
WHOLE BARGAIN IS VOID
HOW CAN I A MAN NOT YET THIRTY TAKE OUT WITH ME
TO INDIA A GIRL OF NINETEEN UNLESS SHE BE MARRIED TO ME HOW CAN WE BE
FOR EVER TOGETHER SOMETIMES IN SOLITUDES SOMETIMES AMIDST SAVAGE
TRIBES AND UNWED
VERY WELL I SAID SHORTLY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES QUITE AS WELL AS
IF I WERE EITHER YOUR REAL SISTER OR A MAN AND A CLERGYMAN LIKE
YOURSELF
IT IS KNOWN THAT YOU ARE NOT MY SISTER I CANNOT INTRODUCE YOU AS SUCH
TO ATTEMPT IT WOULD BE TO FASTEN INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS ON US BOTH
AND
FOR THE REST THOUGH YOU HAVE A MAN'S VIGOROUS BRAIN YOU HAVE A WOMAN'S
HEART AND IT WOULD NOT DO
IT WOULD DO I AFFIRMED WITH SOME DISDAIN PERFECTLY WELL
I HAVE A
WOMAN'S HEART BUT NOT WHERE YOU ARE CONCERNED FOR YOU I HAVE ONLY A
COMRADE'S CONSTANCY A FELLOW SOLDIER'S FRANKNESS FIDELITY FRATERNITY
IF YOU LIKE A NEOPHYTE'S RESPECT AND SUBMISSION TO HIS HIEROPHANT
NOTHING MORE DON'T FEAR
IT IS WHAT I WANT HE SAID SPEAKING TO HIMSELF IT IS JUST WHAT I
WANT
AND THERE ARE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY THEY MUST BE HEWN DOWN
JANE
YOU WOULD NOT REPENT MARRYING ME BE CERTAIN OF THAT WE MUST BE
MARRIED
I REPEAT IT THERE IS NO OTHER WAY AND UNDOUBTEDLY ENOUGH OF
LOVE WOULD FOLLOW UPON MARRIAGE TO RENDER THE UNION RIGHT EVEN IN YOUR
EYES
I SCORN YOUR IDEA OF LOVE I COULD NOT HELP SAYING AS I ROSE UP AND
STOOD BEFORE HIM LEANING MY BACK AGAINST THE ROCK
I SCORN THE
COUNTERFEIT SENTIMENT YOU OFFER YES ST
JOHN AND I SCORN YOU WHEN YOU
OFFER IT
HE LOOKED AT ME FIXEDLY COMPRESSING HIS WELL CUT LIPS WHILE HE DID SO
WHETHER HE WAS INCENSED OR SURPRISED OR WHAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO TELL
HE COULD COMMAND HIS COUNTENANCE THOROUGHLY
I SCARCELY EXPECTED TO HEAR THAT EXPRESSION FROM YOU HE SAID I THINK
I HAVE DONE AND UTTERED NOTHING TO DESERVE SCORN
I WAS TOUCHED BY HIS GENTLE TONE AND OVERAWED BY HIS HIGH CALM MIEN
FORGIVE ME THE WORDS ST
JOHN BUT IT IS YOUR OWN FAULT THAT I HAVE
BEEN ROUSED TO SPEAK SO UNGUARDEDLY
YOU HAVE INTRODUCED A TOPIC ON
WHICH OUR NATURES ARE AT VARIANCE A TOPIC WE SHOULD NEVER DISCUSS THE
VERY NAME OF LOVE IS AN APPLE OF DISCORD BETWEEN US
IF THE REALITY WERE
REQUIRED WHAT SHOULD WE DO HOW SHOULD WE FEEL MY DEAR COUSIN
ABANDON YOUR SCHEME OF MARRIAGE FORGET IT
NO SAID HE IT IS A LONG CHERISHED SCHEME AND THE ONLY ONE WHICH CAN
SECURE MY GREAT END BUT I SHALL URGE YOU NO FURTHER AT PRESENT
TO MORROW I LEAVE HOME FOR CAMBRIDGE I HAVE MANY FRIENDS THERE TO WHOM
I SHOULD WISH TO SAY FAREWELL
I SHALL BE ABSENT A FORTNIGHT TAKE THAT
SPACE OF TIME TO CONSIDER MY OFFER AND DO NOT FORGET THAT IF YOU REJECT
IT IT IS NOT ME YOU DENY BUT GOD
THROUGH MY MEANS HE OPENS TO YOU A
NOBLE CAREER AS MY WIFE ONLY CAN YOU ENTER UPON IT
REFUSE TO BE MY
WIFE AND YOU LIMIT YOURSELF FOR EVER TO A TRACK OF SELFISH EASE AND
BARREN OBSCURITY
TREMBLE LEST IN THAT CASE YOU SHOULD BE NUMBERED WITH
THOSE WHO HAVE DENIED THE FAITH AND ARE WORSE THAN INFIDELS
HE HAD DONE
TURNING FROM ME HE ONCE MORE
LOOKED TO RIVER LOOKED TO HILL
BUT THIS TIME HIS FEELINGS WERE ALL PENT IN HIS HEART I WAS NOT WORTHY
TO HEAR THEM UTTERED
AS I WALKED BY HIS SIDE HOMEWARD I READ WELL IN
HIS IRON SILENCE ALL HE FELT TOWARDS ME THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF AN AUSTERE
AND DESPOTIC NATURE WHICH HAS MET RESISTANCE WHERE IT EXPECTED
SUBMISSION THE DISAPPROBATION OF A COOL INFLEXIBLE JUDGMENT WHICH HAS
DETECTED IN ANOTHER FEELINGS AND VIEWS IN WHICH IT HAS NO POWER TO
SYMPATHISE IN SHORT AS A MAN HE WOULD HAVE WISHED TO COERCE ME INTO
OBEDIENCE IT WAS ONLY AS A SINCERE CHRISTIAN HE BORE SO PATIENTLY WITH
MY PERVERSITY AND ALLOWED SO LONG A SPACE FOR REFLECTION AND REPENTANCE
THAT NIGHT AFTER HE HAD KISSED HIS SISTERS HE THOUGHT PROPER TO FORGET
EVEN TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME BUT LEFT THE ROOM IN SILENCE
I WHO
THOUGH I HAD NO LOVE HAD MUCH FRIENDSHIP FOR HIM WAS HURT BY THE MARKED
OMISSION SO MUCH HURT THAT TEARS STARTED TO MY EYES
I SEE YOU AND ST
JOHN HAVE BEEN QUARRELLING JANE SAID DIANA DURING
YOUR WALK ON THE MOOR
BUT GO AFTER HIM HE IS NOW LINGERING IN THE
PASSAGE EXPECTING YOU HE WILL MAKE IT UP
I HAVE NOT MUCH PRIDE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD ALWAYS RATHER BE
HAPPY THAN DIGNIFIED AND I RAN AFTER HIM HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE
STAIRS
GOOD NIGHT ST
JOHN SAID I
GOOD NIGHT JANE HE REPLIED CALMLY
THEN SHAKE HANDS I ADDED
WHAT A COLD LOOSE TOUCH HE IMPRESSED ON MY FINGERS HE WAS DEEPLY
DISPLEASED BY WHAT HAD OCCURRED THAT DAY CORDIALITY WOULD NOT WARM NOR
TEARS MOVE HIM
NO HAPPY RECONCILIATION WAS TO BE HAD WITH HIM NO
CHEERING SMILE OR GENEROUS WORD BUT STILL THE CHRISTIAN WAS PATIENT AND
PLACID AND WHEN I ASKED HIM IF HE FORGAVE ME HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS
NOT IN THE HABIT OF CHERISHING THE REMEMBRANCE OF VEXATION THAT HE HAD
NOTHING TO FORGIVE NOT HAVING BEEN OFFENDED
AND WITH THAT ANSWER HE LEFT ME
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HE HAD KNOCKED ME
DOWN
CHAPTER XXXV
HE DID NOT LEAVE FOR CAMBRIDGE THE NEXT DAY AS HE HAD SAID HE WOULD
HE
DEFERRED HIS DEPARTURE A WHOLE WEEK AND DURING THAT TIME HE MADE ME FEEL
WHAT SEVERE PUNISHMENT A GOOD YET STERN A CONSCIENTIOUS YET IMPLACABLE
MAN CAN INFLICT ON ONE WHO HAS OFFENDED HIM
WITHOUT ONE OVERT ACT OF
HOSTILITY ONE UPBRAIDING WORD HE CONTRIVED TO IMPRESS ME MOMENTLY WITH
THE CONVICTION THAT I WAS PUT BEYOND THE PALE OF HIS FAVOUR
NOT THAT ST
JOHN HARBOURED A SPIRIT OF UNCHRISTIAN VINDICTIVENESS NOT
THAT HE WOULD HAVE INJURED A HAIR OF MY HEAD IF IT HAD BEEN FULLY IN HIS
POWER TO DO SO
BOTH BY NATURE AND PRINCIPLE HE WAS SUPERIOR TO THE
MEAN GRATIFICATION OF VENGEANCE HE HAD FORGIVEN ME FOR SAYING I SCORNED
HIM AND HIS LOVE BUT HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE WORDS AND AS LONG AS HE
AND I LIVED HE NEVER WOULD FORGET THEM
I SAW BY HIS LOOK WHEN HE
TURNED TO ME THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS WRITTEN ON THE AIR BETWEEN ME AND
HIM WHENEVER I SPOKE THEY SOUNDED IN MY VOICE TO HIS EAR AND THEIR
ECHO TONED EVERY ANSWER HE GAVE ME
HE DID NOT ABSTAIN FROM CONVERSING WITH ME HE EVEN CALLED ME AS USUAL
EACH MORNING TO JOIN HIM AT HIS DESK AND I FEAR THE CORRUPT MAN WITHIN
HIM HAD A PLEASURE UNIMPARTED TO AND UNSHARED BY THE PURE CHRISTIAN IN
EVINCING WITH WHAT SKILL HE COULD WHILE ACTING AND SPEAKING APPARENTLY
JUST AS USUAL EXTRACT FROM EVERY DEED AND EVERY PHRASE THE SPIRIT OF
INTEREST AND APPROVAL WHICH HAD FORMERLY COMMUNICATED A CERTAIN AUSTERE
CHARM TO HIS LANGUAGE AND MANNER
TO ME HE WAS IN REALITY BECOME NO
LONGER FLESH BUT MARBLE HIS EYE WAS A COLD BRIGHT BLUE GEM HIS
TONGUE A SPEAKING INSTRUMENT NOTHING MORE
ALL THIS WAS TORTURE TO ME REFINED LINGERING TORTURE
IT KEPT UP A
SLOW FIRE OF INDIGNATION AND A TREMBLING TROUBLE OF GRIEF WHICH HARASSED
AND CRUSHED ME ALTOGETHER
I FELT HOW IF I WERE HIS WIFE THIS GOOD
MAN PURE AS THE DEEP SUNLESS SOURCE COULD SOON KILL ME WITHOUT DRAWING
FROM MY VEINS A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD OR RECEIVING ON HIS OWN CRYSTAL
CONSCIENCE THE FAINTEST STAIN OF CRIME
ESPECIALLY I FELT THIS WHEN I
MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO PROPITIATE HIM
NO RUTH MET MY RUTH
HE
EXPERIENCED NO SUFFERING FROM ESTRANGEMENT NO YEARNING AFTER
RECONCILIATION AND THOUGH MORE THAN ONCE MY FAST FALLING TEARS
BLISTERED THE PAGE OVER WHICH WE BOTH BENT THEY PRODUCED NO MORE EFFECT
ON HIM THAN IF HIS HEART HAD BEEN REALLY A MATTER OF STONE OR METAL
TO
HIS SISTERS MEANTIME HE WAS SOMEWHAT KINDER THAN USUAL AS IF AFRAID
THAT MERE COLDNESS WOULD NOT SUFFICIENTLY CONVINCE ME HOW COMPLETELY I
WAS BANISHED AND BANNED HE ADDED THE FORCE OF CONTRAST AND THIS I AM
SURE HE DID NOT BY FORCE BUT ON PRINCIPLE
THE NIGHT BEFORE HE LEFT HOME HAPPENING TO SEE HIM WALKING IN THE GARDEN
ABOUT SUNSET AND REMEMBERING AS I LOOKED AT HIM THAT THIS MAN
ALIENATED AS HE NOW WAS HAD ONCE SAVED MY LIFE AND THAT WE WERE NEAR
RELATIONS I WAS MOVED TO MAKE A LAST ATTEMPT TO REGAIN HIS FRIENDSHIP
I
WENT OUT AND APPROACHED HIM AS HE STOOD LEANING OVER THE LITTLE GATE I
SPOKE TO THE POINT AT ONCE
ST
JOHN I AM UNHAPPY BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL ANGRY WITH ME
LET US BE
FRIENDS
I HOPE WE ARE FRIENDS WAS THE UNMOVED REPLY WHILE HE STILL WATCHED
THE RISING OF THE MOON WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONTEMPLATING AS I APPROACHED
NO ST
JOHN WE ARE NOT FRIENDS AS WE WERE
YOU KNOW THAT
ARE WE NOT THAT IS WRONG
FOR MY PART I WISH YOU NO ILL AND ALL
GOOD
I BELIEVE YOU ST
JOHN FOR I AM SURE YOU ARE INCAPABLE OF WISHING ANY
ONE ILL BUT AS I AM YOUR KINSWOMAN I SHOULD DESIRE SOMEWHAT MORE OF
AFFECTION THAN THAT SORT OF GENERAL PHILANTHROPY YOU EXTEND TO MERE
STRANGERS
OF COURSE HE SAID
YOUR WISH IS REASONABLE AND I AM FAR FROM
REGARDING YOU AS A STRANGER
THIS SPOKEN IN A COOL TRANQUIL TONE WAS MORTIFYING AND BAFFLING
ENOUGH
HAD I ATTENDED TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF PRIDE AND IRE I SHOULD
IMMEDIATELY HAVE LEFT HIM BUT SOMETHING WORKED WITHIN ME MORE STRONGLY
THAN THOSE FEELINGS COULD
I DEEPLY VENERATED MY COUSIN'S TALENT AND
PRINCIPLE
HIS FRIENDSHIP WAS OF VALUE TO ME TO LOSE IT TRIED ME
SEVERELY
I WOULD NOT SO SOON RELINQUISH THE ATTEMPT TO RECONQUER IT
MUST WE PART IN THIS WAY ST
JOHN AND WHEN YOU GO TO INDIA WILL YOU
LEAVE ME SO WITHOUT A KINDER WORD THAN YOU HAVE YET SPOKEN
HE NOW TURNED QUITE FROM THE MOON AND FACED ME
WHEN I GO TO INDIA JANE WILL I LEAVE YOU WHAT DO YOU NOT GO TO
INDIA
YOU SAID I COULD NOT UNLESS I MARRIED YOU
AND YOU WILL NOT MARRY ME YOU ADHERE TO THAT RESOLUTION
READER DO YOU KNOW AS I DO WHAT TERROR THOSE COLD PEOPLE CAN PUT INTO
THE ICE OF THEIR QUESTIONS HOW MUCH OF THE FALL OF THE AVALANCHE IS IN
THEIR ANGER OF THE BREAKING UP OF THE FROZEN SEA IN THEIR DISPLEASURE
NO
ST
JOHN I WILL NOT MARRY YOU
I ADHERE TO MY RESOLUTION
THE AVALANCHE HAD SHAKEN AND SLID A LITTLE FORWARD BUT IT DID NOT YET
CRASH DOWN
ONCE MORE WHY THIS REFUSAL HE ASKED
FORMERLY I ANSWERED BECAUSE YOU DID NOT LOVE ME NOW I REPLY
BECAUSE YOU ALMOST HATE ME
IF I WERE TO MARRY YOU YOU WOULD KILL ME
YOU ARE KILLING ME NOW
HIS LIPS AND CHEEKS TURNED WHITE QUITE WHITE
I SHOULD KILL YOU I AM KILLING YOU YOUR WORDS ARE SUCH AS OUGHT
NOT TO BE USED VIOLENT UNFEMININE AND UNTRUE
THEY BETRAY AN
UNFORTUNATE STATE OF MIND THEY MERIT SEVERE REPROOF THEY WOULD SEEM
INEXCUSABLE BUT THAT IT IS THE DUTY OF MAN TO FORGIVE HIS FELLOW EVEN
UNTIL SEVENTY AND SEVEN TIMES
I HAD FINISHED THE BUSINESS NOW
WHILE EARNESTLY WISHING TO ERASE FROM
HIS MIND THE TRACE OF MY FORMER OFFENCE I HAD STAMPED ON THAT TENACIOUS
SURFACE ANOTHER AND FAR DEEPER IMPRESSION I HAD BURNT IT IN
NOW YOU WILL INDEED HATE ME I SAID
IT IS USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO
CONCILIATE YOU I SEE I HAVE MADE AN ETERNAL ENEMY OF YOU
A FRESH WRONG DID THESE WORDS INFLICT THE WORSE BECAUSE THEY TOUCHED ON
THE TRUTH
THAT BLOODLESS LIP QUIVERED TO A TEMPORARY SPASM
I KNEW THE
STEELY IRE I HAD WHETTED
I WAS HEART WRUNG
YOU UTTERLY MISINTERPRET MY WORDS I SAID AT ONCE SEIZING HIS HAND I
HAVE NO INTENTION TO GRIEVE OR PAIN YOU INDEED I HAVE NOT
MOST BITTERLY HE SMILED MOST DECIDEDLY HE WITHDREW HIS HAND FROM MINE
AND NOW YOU RECALL YOUR PROMISE AND WILL NOT GO TO INDIA AT ALL I
PRESUME SAID HE AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE
YES I WILL AS YOUR ASSISTANT I ANSWERED
A VERY LONG SILENCE SUCCEEDED
WHAT STRUGGLE THERE WAS IN HIM BETWEEN
NATURE AND GRACE IN THIS INTERVAL I CANNOT TELL ONLY SINGULAR GLEAMS
SCINTILLATED IN HIS EYES AND STRANGE SHADOWS PASSED OVER HIS FACE
HE
SPOKE AT LAST
I BEFORE PROVED TO YOU THE ABSURDITY OF A SINGLE WOMAN OF YOUR AGE
PROPOSING TO ACCOMPANY ABROAD A SINGLE MAN OF MINE
I PROVED IT TO YOU
IN SUCH TERMS AS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED YOUR EVER
AGAIN ALLUDING TO THE PLAN
THAT YOU HAVE DONE SO I REGRET FOR YOUR
SAKE
I INTERRUPTED HIM
ANYTHING LIKE A TANGIBLE REPROACH GAVE ME COURAGE AT
ONCE
KEEP TO COMMON SENSE ST
JOHN YOU ARE VERGING ON NONSENSE
YOU
PRETEND TO BE SHOCKED BY WHAT I HAVE SAID
YOU ARE NOT REALLY SHOCKED
FOR WITH YOUR SUPERIOR MIND YOU CANNOT BE EITHER SO DULL OR SO
CONCEITED AS TO MISUNDERSTAND MY MEANING
I SAY AGAIN I WILL BE YOUR
CURATE IF YOU LIKE BUT NEVER YOUR WIFE
AGAIN HE TURNED LIVIDLY PALE BUT AS BEFORE CONTROLLED HIS PASSION
PERFECTLY
HE ANSWERED EMPHATICALLY BUT CALMLY
A FEMALE CURATE WHO IS NOT MY WIFE WOULD NEVER SUIT ME
WITH ME
THEN IT SEEMS YOU CANNOT GO BUT IF YOU ARE SINCERE IN YOUR OFFER I
WILL WHILE IN TOWN SPEAK TO A MARRIED MISSIONARY WHOSE WIFE NEEDS A
COADJUTOR
YOUR OWN FORTUNE WILL MAKE YOU INDEPENDENT OF THE SOCIETY'S
AID AND THUS YOU MAY STILL BE SPARED THE DISHONOUR OF BREAKING YOUR
PROMISE AND DESERTING THE BAND YOU ENGAGED TO JOIN
NOW I NEVER HAD AS THE READER KNOWS EITHER GIVEN ANY FORMAL PROMISE OR
ENTERED INTO ANY ENGAGEMENT AND THIS LANGUAGE WAS ALL MUCH TOO HARD AND
MUCH TOO DESPOTIC FOR THE OCCASION
I REPLIED
THERE IS NO DISHONOUR NO BREACH OF PROMISE NO DESERTION IN THE CASE
I
AM NOT UNDER THE SLIGHTEST OBLIGATION TO GO TO INDIA ESPECIALLY WITH
STRANGERS
WITH YOU I WOULD HAVE VENTURED MUCH BECAUSE I ADMIRE
CONFIDE IN AND AS A SISTER I LOVE YOU BUT I AM CONVINCED THAT GO
WHEN AND WITH WHOM I WOULD I SHOULD NOT LIVE LONG IN THAT CLIMATE
AH YOU ARE AFRAID OF YOURSELF HE SAID CURLING HIS LIP
I AM
GOD DID NOT GIVE ME MY LIFE TO THROW AWAY AND TO DO AS YOU WISH
ME WOULD I BEGIN TO THINK BE ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO COMMITTING SUICIDE
MOREOVER BEFORE I DEFINITIVELY RESOLVE ON QUITTING ENGLAND I WILL KNOW
FOR CERTAIN WHETHER I CANNOT BE OF GREATER USE BY REMAINING IN IT THAN BY
LEAVING IT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT WOULD BE FRUITLESS TO ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN BUT THERE IS A POINT ON
WHICH I HAVE LONG ENDURED PAINFUL DOUBT AND I CAN GO NOWHERE TILL BY
SOME MEANS THAT DOUBT IS REMOVED
I KNOW WHERE YOUR HEART TURNS AND TO WHAT IT CLINGS
THE INTEREST YOU
CHERISH IS LAWLESS AND UNCONSECRATED
LONG SINCE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
CRUSHED IT NOW YOU SHOULD BLUSH TO ALLUDE TO IT
YOU THINK OF MR
ROCHESTER
IT WAS TRUE
I CONFESSED IT BY SILENCE
ARE YOU GOING TO SEEK MR
ROCHESTER
I MUST FIND OUT WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM
IT REMAINS FOR ME THEN HE SAID TO REMEMBER YOU IN MY PRAYERS AND
TO ENTREAT GOD FOR YOU IN ALL EARNESTNESS THAT YOU MAY NOT INDEED
BECOME A CASTAWAY
I HAD THOUGHT I RECOGNISED IN YOU ONE OF THE CHOSEN
BUT GOD SEES NOT AS MAN SEES HIS WILL BE DONE
HE OPENED THE GATE PASSED THROUGH IT AND STRAYED AWAY DOWN THE GLEN
HE
WAS SOON OUT OF SIGHT
ON RE ENTERING THE PARLOUR I FOUND DIANA STANDING AT THE WINDOW LOOKING
VERY THOUGHTFUL
DIANA WAS A GREAT DEAL TALLER THAN I SHE PUT HER HAND
ON MY SHOULDER AND STOOPING EXAMINED MY FACE
JANE SHE SAID YOU ARE ALWAYS AGITATED AND PALE NOW
I AM SURE THERE
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER
TELL ME WHAT BUSINESS ST
JOHN AND YOU HAVE ON
HANDS
I HAVE WATCHED YOU THIS HALF HOUR FROM THE WINDOW YOU MUST
FORGIVE MY BEING SUCH A SPY BUT FOR A LONG TIME I HAVE FANCIED I HARDLY
KNOW WHAT
ST
JOHN IS A STRANGE BEING
SHE PAUSED I DID NOT SPEAK SOON SHE RESUMED
THAT BROTHER OF MINE CHERISHES PECULIAR VIEWS OF SOME SORT RESPECTING
YOU I AM SURE HE HAS LONG DISTINGUISHED YOU BY A NOTICE AND INTEREST HE
NEVER SHOWED TO ANY ONE ELSE TO WHAT END I WISH HE LOVED YOU DOES HE
JANE
I PUT HER COOL HAND TO MY HOT FOREHEAD NO DIE NOT ONE WHIT
THEN WHY DOES HE FOLLOW YOU SO WITH HIS EYES AND GET YOU SO FREQUENTLY
ALONE WITH HIM AND KEEP YOU SO CONTINUALLY AT HIS SIDE MARY AND I HAD
BOTH CONCLUDED HE WISHED YOU TO MARRY HIM
HE DOES HE HAS ASKED ME TO BE HIS WIFE
DIANA CLAPPED HER HANDS
THAT IS JUST WHAT WE HOPED AND THOUGHT AND
YOU WILL MARRY HIM JANE WON'T YOU AND THEN HE WILL STAY IN ENGLAND
FAR FROM THAT DIANA HIS SOLE IDEA IN PROPOSING TO ME IS TO PROCURE A
FITTING FELLOW LABOURER IN HIS INDIAN TOILS
WHAT HE WISHES YOU TO GO TO INDIA
YES
MADNESS SHE EXCLAIMED
YOU WOULD NOT LIVE THREE MONTHS THERE I AM
CERTAIN
YOU NEVER SHALL GO YOU HAVE NOT CONSENTED HAVE YOU JANE
I HAVE REFUSED TO MARRY HIM
AND HAVE CONSEQUENTLY DISPLEASED HIM SHE SUGGESTED
DEEPLY HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME I FEAR YET I OFFERED TO ACCOMPANY HIM
AS HIS SISTER
IT WAS FRANTIC FOLLY TO DO SO JANE
THINK OF THE TASK YOU
UNDERTOOK ONE OF INCESSANT FATIGUE WHERE FATIGUE KILLS EVEN THE STRONG
AND YOU ARE WEAK
ST
JOHN YOU KNOW HIM WOULD URGE YOU TO
IMPOSSIBILITIES WITH HIM THERE WOULD BE NO PERMISSION TO REST DURING THE
HOT HOURS AND UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOTICED WHATEVER HE EXACTS YOU
FORCE YOURSELF TO PERFORM
I AM ASTONISHED YOU FOUND COURAGE TO REFUSE
HIS HAND
YOU DO NOT LOVE HIM THEN JANE
NOT AS A HUSBAND
YET HE IS A HANDSOME FELLOW
AND I AM SO PLAIN YOU SEE DIE
WE SHOULD NEVER SUIT
PLAIN YOU NOT AT ALL
YOU ARE MUCH TOO PRETTY AS WELL AS TOO GOOD
TO BE GRILLED ALIVE IN CALCUTTA AND AGAIN SHE EARNESTLY CONJURED ME TO
GIVE UP ALL THOUGHTS OF GOING OUT WITH HER BROTHER
I MUST INDEED I SAID FOR WHEN JUST NOW I REPEATED THE OFFER OF
SERVING HIM FOR A DEACON HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF SHOCKED AT MY WANT OF
DECENCY
HE SEEMED TO THINK I HAD COMMITTED AN IMPROPRIETY IN PROPOSING
TO ACCOMPANY HIM UNMARRIED AS IF I HAD NOT FROM THE FIRST HOPED TO FIND
IN HIM A BROTHER AND HABITUALLY REGARDED HIM AS SUCH
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY HE DOES NOT LOVE YOU JANE
YOU SHOULD HEAR HIMSELF ON THE SUBJECT
HE HAS AGAIN AND AGAIN
EXPLAINED THAT IT IS NOT HIMSELF BUT HIS OFFICE HE WISHES TO MATE
HE
HAS TOLD ME I AM FORMED FOR LABOUR NOT FOR LOVE WHICH IS TRUE NO
DOUBT
BUT IN MY OPINION IF I AM NOT FORMED FOR LOVE IT FOLLOWS THAT
I AM NOT FORMED FOR MARRIAGE
WOULD IT NOT BE STRANGE DIE TO BE
CHAINED FOR LIFE TO A MAN WHO REGARDED ONE BUT AS A USEFUL TOOL
INSUPPORTABLE UNNATURAL OUT OF THE QUESTION
AND THEN I CONTINUED THOUGH I HAVE ONLY SISTERLY AFFECTION FOR HIM
NOW YET IF FORCED TO BE HIS WIFE I CAN IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITY OF
CONCEIVING AN INEVITABLE STRANGE TORTURING KIND OF LOVE FOR HIM
BECAUSE HE IS SO TALENTED AND THERE IS OFTEN A CERTAIN HEROIC GRANDEUR
IN HIS LOOK MANNER AND CONVERSATION
IN THAT CASE MY LOT WOULD BECOME
UNSPEAKABLY WRETCHED
HE WOULD NOT WANT ME TO LOVE HIM AND IF I SHOWED
THE FEELING HE WOULD MAKE ME SENSIBLE THAT IT WAS A SUPERFLUITY
UNREQUIRED BY HIM UNBECOMING IN ME
I KNOW HE WOULD
AND YET ST
JOHN IS A GOOD MAN SAID DIANA
HE IS A GOOD AND A GREAT MAN BUT HE FORGETS PITILESSLY THE FEELINGS
AND CLAIMS OF LITTLE PEOPLE IN PURSUING HIS OWN LARGE VIEWS
IT IS
BETTER THEREFORE FOR THE INSIGNIFICANT TO KEEP OUT OF HIS WAY LEST IN
HIS PROGRESS HE SHOULD TRAMPLE THEM DOWN
HERE HE COMES I WILL LEAVE
YOU DIANA AND I HASTENED UPSTAIRS AS I SAW HIM ENTERING THE GARDEN
BUT I WAS FORCED TO MEET HIM AGAIN AT SUPPER
DURING THAT MEAL HE
APPEARED JUST AS COMPOSED AS USUAL
I HAD THOUGHT HE WOULD HARDLY SPEAK
TO ME AND I WAS CERTAIN HE HAD GIVEN UP THE PURSUIT OF HIS MATRIMONIAL
SCHEME THE SEQUEL SHOWED I WAS MISTAKEN ON BOTH POINTS
HE ADDRESSED ME
PRECISELY IN HIS ORDINARY MANNER OR WHAT HAD OF LATE BEEN HIS ORDINARY
MANNER ONE SCRUPULOUSLY POLITE
NO DOUBT HE HAD INVOKED THE HELP OF THE
HOLY SPIRIT TO SUBDUE THE ANGER I HAD ROUSED IN HIM AND NOW BELIEVED HE
HAD FORGIVEN ME ONCE MORE
FOR THE EVENING READING BEFORE PRAYERS HE SELECTED THE TWENTY FIRST
CHAPTER OF REVELATION
IT WAS AT ALL TIMES PLEASANT TO LISTEN WHILE FROM
HIS LIPS FELL THE WORDS OF THE BIBLE NEVER DID HIS FINE VOICE SOUND AT
ONCE SO SWEET AND FULL NEVER DID HIS MANNER BECOME SO IMPRESSIVE IN ITS
NOBLE SIMPLICITY AS WHEN HE DELIVERED THE ORACLES OF GOD AND TO NIGHT
THAT VOICE TOOK A MORE SOLEMN TONE THAT MANNER A MORE THRILLING
MEANING AS HE SAT IN THE MIDST OF HIS HOUSEHOLD CIRCLE THE MAY MOON
SHINING IN THROUGH THE UNCURTAINED WINDOW AND RENDERING ALMOST
UNNECESSARY THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE ON THE TABLE AS HE SAT THERE
BENDING OVER THE GREAT OLD BIBLE AND DESCRIBED FROM ITS PAGE THE VISION
OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH TOLD HOW GOD WOULD COME TO DWELL
WITH MEN HOW HE WOULD WIPE AWAY ALL TEARS FROM THEIR EYES AND PROMISED
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE DEATH NEITHER SORROW NOR CRYING NOR ANY
MORE PAIN BECAUSE THE FORMER THINGS WERE PASSED AWAY
THE SUCCEEDING WORDS THRILLED ME STRANGELY AS HE SPOKE THEM ESPECIALLY
AS I FELT BY THE SLIGHT INDESCRIBABLE ALTERATION IN SOUND THAT IN
UTTERING THEM HIS EYE HAD TURNED ON ME
HE THAT OVERCOMETH SHALL INHERIT ALL THINGS AND I WILL BE HIS GOD AND
HE SHALL BE MY SON
BUT WAS SLOWLY DISTINCTLY READ THE FEARFUL THE
UNBELIEVING C SHALL HAVE THEIR PART IN THE LAKE WHICH BURNETH WITH
FIRE AND BRIMSTONE WHICH IS THE SECOND DEATH
HENCEFORWARD I KNEW WHAT FATE ST
JOHN FEARED FOR ME
A CALM SUBDUED TRIUMPH BLENT WITH A LONGING EARNESTNESS MARKED HIS
ENUNCIATION OF THE LAST GLORIOUS VERSES OF THAT CHAPTER
THE READER
BELIEVED HIS NAME WAS ALREADY WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE AND HE
YEARNED AFTER THE HOUR WHICH SHOULD ADMIT HIM TO THE CITY TO WHICH THE
KINGS OF THE EARTH BRING THEIR GLORY AND HONOUR WHICH HAS NO NEED OF SUN
OR MOON TO SHINE IN IT BECAUSE THE GLORY OF GOD LIGHTENS IT AND THE
LAMB IS THE LIGHT THEREOF
IN THE PRAYER FOLLOWING THE CHAPTER ALL HIS ENERGY GATHERED ALL HIS
STERN ZEAL WOKE HE WAS IN DEEP EARNEST WRESTLING WITH GOD AND RESOLVED
ON A CONQUEST
HE SUPPLICATED STRENGTH FOR THE WEAK HEARTED GUIDANCE
FOR WANDERERS FROM THE FOLD A RETURN EVEN AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR FOR
THOSE WHOM THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE WORLD AND THE FLESH WERE LURING FROM
THE NARROW PATH
HE ASKED HE URGED HE CLAIMED THE BOON OF A BRAND
SNATCHED FROM THE BURNING
EARNESTNESS IS EVER DEEPLY SOLEMN FIRST AS
I LISTENED TO THAT PRAYER I WONDERED AT HIS THEN WHEN IT CONTINUED AND
ROSE I WAS TOUCHED BY IT AND AT LAST AWED
HE FELT THE GREATNESS AND
GOODNESS OF HIS PURPOSE SO SINCERELY OTHERS WHO HEARD HIM PLEAD FOR IT
COULD NOT BUT FEEL IT TOO
THE PRAYER OVER WE TOOK LEAVE OF HIM HE WAS TO GO AT A VERY EARLY HOUR
IN THE MORNING
DIANA AND MARY HAVING KISSED HIM LEFT THE ROOM IN
COMPLIANCE I THINK WITH A WHISPERED HINT FROM HIM I TENDERED MY HAND
AND WISHED HIM A PLEASANT JOURNEY
THANK YOU JANE
AS I SAID I SHALL RETURN FROM CAMBRIDGE IN A
FORTNIGHT THAT SPACE THEN IS YET LEFT YOU FOR REFLECTION
IF I
LISTENED TO HUMAN PRIDE I SHOULD SAY NO MORE TO YOU OF MARRIAGE WITH ME
BUT I LISTEN TO MY DUTY AND KEEP STEADILY IN VIEW MY FIRST AIM TO DO
ALL THINGS TO THE GLORY OF GOD
MY MASTER WAS LONG SUFFERING SO WILL I
BE
I CANNOT GIVE YOU UP TO PERDITION AS A VESSEL OF WRATH
REPENT RESOLVE WHILE THERE IS YET TIME
REMEMBER WE ARE BID TO WORK
WHILE IT IS DAY WARNED THAT 'THE NIGHT COMETH WHEN NO MAN SHALL WORK
REMEMBER THE FATE OF DIVES WHO HAD HIS GOOD THINGS IN THIS LIFE
GOD
GIVE YOU STRENGTH TO CHOOSE THAT BETTER PART WHICH SHALL NOT BE TAKEN
FROM YOU
HE LAID HIS HAND ON MY HEAD AS HE UTTERED THE LAST WORDS
HE HAD SPOKEN
EARNESTLY MILDLY HIS LOOK WAS NOT INDEED THAT OF A LOVER BEHOLDING
HIS MISTRESS BUT IT WAS THAT OF A PASTOR RECALLING HIS WANDERING
SHEEP OR BETTER OF A GUARDIAN ANGEL WATCHING THE SOUL FOR WHICH HE IS
RESPONSIBLE
ALL MEN OF TALENT WHETHER THEY BE MEN OF FEELING OR NOT
WHETHER THEY BE ZEALOTS OR ASPIRANTS OR DESPOTS PROVIDED ONLY THEY BE
SINCERE HAVE THEIR SUBLIME MOMENTS WHEN THEY SUBDUE AND RULE
I FELT
VENERATION FOR ST
JOHN VENERATION SO STRONG THAT ITS IMPETUS THRUST ME
AT ONCE TO THE POINT I HAD SO LONG SHUNNED
I WAS TEMPTED TO CEASE
STRUGGLING WITH HIM TO RUSH DOWN THE TORRENT OF HIS WILL INTO THE GULF
OF HIS EXISTENCE AND THERE LOSE MY OWN
I WAS ALMOST AS HARD BESET BY
HIM NOW AS I HAD BEEN ONCE BEFORE IN A DIFFERENT WAY BY ANOTHER
I WAS
A FOOL BOTH TIMES
TO HAVE YIELDED THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ERROR OF
PRINCIPLE TO HAVE YIELDED NOW WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT
SO
I THINK AT THIS HOUR WHEN I LOOK BACK TO THE CRISIS THROUGH THE QUIET
MEDIUM OF TIME I WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF FOLLY AT THE INSTANT
I STOOD MOTIONLESS UNDER MY HIEROPHANT'S TOUCH
MY REFUSALS WERE
FORGOTTEN MY FEARS OVERCOME MY WRESTLINGS PARALYSED
THE
IMPOSSIBLE I E MY MARRIAGE WITH ST
JOHN WAS FAST BECOMING THE
POSSIBLE
ALL WAS CHANGING UTTERLY WITH A SUDDEN SWEEP
RELIGION
CALLED ANGELS BECKONED GOD COMMANDED LIFE ROLLED TOGETHER LIKE A
SCROLL DEATH'S GATES OPENING SHOWED ETERNITY BEYOND IT SEEMED THAT
FOR SAFETY AND BLISS THERE ALL HERE MIGHT BE SACRIFICED IN A SECOND
THE
DIM ROOM WAS FULL OF VISIONS
COULD YOU DECIDE NOW ASKED THE MISSIONARY
THE INQUIRY WAS PUT IN
GENTLE TONES HE DREW ME TO HIM AS GENTLY
OH THAT GENTLENESS HOW FAR
MORE POTENT IS IT THAN FORCE I COULD RESIST ST
JOHN'S WRATH I GREW
PLIANT AS A REED UNDER HIS KINDNESS
YET I KNEW ALL THE TIME IF I
YIELDED NOW I SHOULD NOT THE LESS BE MADE TO REPENT SOME DAY OF MY
FORMER REBELLION
HIS NATURE WAS NOT CHANGED BY ONE HOUR OF SOLEMN
PRAYER IT WAS ONLY ELEVATED
I COULD DECIDE IF I WERE BUT CERTAIN I ANSWERED WERE I BUT CONVINCED
THAT IT IS GOD'S WILL I SHOULD MARRY YOU I COULD VOW TO MARRY YOU HERE
AND NOW COME AFTERWARDS WHAT WOULD
MY PRAYERS ARE HEARD EJACULATED ST
JOHN
HE PRESSED HIS HAND FIRMER
ON MY HEAD AS IF HE CLAIMED ME HE SURROUNDED ME WITH HIS ARM ALMOST
AS IF HE LOVED ME I SAY ALMOST I KNEW THE DIFFERENCE FOR I HAD FELT
WHAT IT WAS TO BE LOVED BUT LIKE HIM I HAD NOW PUT LOVE OUT OF THE
QUESTION AND THOUGHT ONLY OF DUTY
I CONTENDED WITH MY INWARD DIMNESS
OF VISION BEFORE WHICH CLOUDS YET ROLLED
I SINCERELY DEEPLY
FERVENTLY LONGED TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT AND ONLY THAT
SHOW ME SHOW ME
THE PATH I ENTREATED OF HEAVEN
I WAS EXCITED MORE THAN I HAD EVER
BEEN AND WHETHER WHAT FOLLOWED WAS THE EFFECT OF EXCITEMENT THE READER
SHALL JUDGE
ALL THE HOUSE WAS STILL FOR I BELIEVE ALL EXCEPT ST
JOHN AND MYSELF
WERE NOW RETIRED TO REST
THE ONE CANDLE WAS DYING OUT THE ROOM WAS
FULL OF MOONLIGHT
MY HEART BEAT FAST AND THICK I HEARD ITS THROB
SUDDENLY IT STOOD STILL TO AN INEXPRESSIBLE FEELING THAT THRILLED IT
THROUGH AND PASSED AT ONCE TO MY HEAD AND EXTREMITIES
THE FEELING WAS
NOT LIKE AN ELECTRIC SHOCK BUT IT WAS QUITE AS SHARP AS STRANGE AS
STARTLING IT ACTED ON MY SENSES AS IF THEIR UTMOST ACTIVITY HITHERTO HAD
BEEN BUT TORPOR FROM WHICH THEY WERE NOW SUMMONED AND FORCED TO WAKE
THEY ROSE EXPECTANT EYE AND EAR WAITED WHILE THE FLESH QUIVERED ON MY
BONES
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD WHAT DO YOU SEE ASKED ST
JOHN
I SAW NOTHING
BUT I HEARD A VOICE SOMEWHERE CRY
JANE JANE JANE NOTHING MORE
O GOD WHAT IS IT I GASPED
I MIGHT HAVE SAID WHERE IS IT FOR IT DID NOT SEEM IN THE ROOM NOR IN
THE HOUSE NOR IN THE GARDEN IT DID NOT COME OUT OF THE AIR NOR FROM
UNDER THE EARTH NOR FROM OVERHEAD
I HAD HEARD IT WHERE OR WHENCE
FOR EVER IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW AND IT WAS THE VOICE OF A HUMAN BEING A
KNOWN LOVED WELL REMEMBERED VOICE THAT OF EDWARD FAIRFAX ROCHESTER
AND IT SPOKE IN PAIN AND WOE WILDLY EERILY URGENTLY
I AM COMING I CRIED
WAIT FOR ME OH I WILL COME I FLEW TO THE
DOOR AND LOOKED INTO THE PASSAGE IT WAS DARK
I RAN OUT INTO THE
GARDEN IT WAS VOID
WHERE ARE YOU I EXCLAIMED
THE HILLS BEYOND MARSH GLEN SENT THE ANSWER FAINTLY BACK WHERE ARE
YOU I LISTENED
THE WIND SIGHED LOW IN THE FIRS ALL WAS MOORLAND
LONELINESS AND MIDNIGHT HUSH
DOWN SUPERSTITION I COMMENTED AS THAT SPECTRE ROSE UP BLACK BY THE
BLACK YEW AT THE GATE
THIS IS NOT THY DECEPTION NOR THY WITCHCRAFT
IT IS THE WORK OF NATURE
SHE WAS ROUSED AND DID NO MIRACLE BUT HER
BEST
I BROKE FROM ST
JOHN WHO HAD FOLLOWED AND WOULD HAVE DETAINED ME
IT
WAS MY TIME TO ASSUME ASCENDENCY
MY POWERS WERE IN PLAY AND IN
FORCE
I TOLD HIM TO FORBEAR QUESTION OR REMARK I DESIRED HIM TO LEAVE
ME I MUST AND WOULD BE ALONE
HE OBEYED AT ONCE
WHERE THERE IS ENERGY
TO COMMAND WELL ENOUGH OBEDIENCE NEVER FAILS
I MOUNTED TO MY CHAMBER
LOCKED MYSELF IN FELL ON MY KNEES AND PRAYED IN MY WAY A DIFFERENT WAY
TO ST
JOHN'S BUT EFFECTIVE IN ITS OWN FASHION
I SEEMED TO PENETRATE
VERY NEAR A MIGHTY SPIRIT AND MY SOUL RUSHED OUT IN GRATITUDE AT HIS
FEET
I ROSE FROM THE THANKSGIVING TOOK A RESOLVE AND LAY DOWN
UNSCARED ENLIGHTENED EAGER BUT FOR THE DAYLIGHT
CHAPTER XXXVI
THE DAYLIGHT CAME
I ROSE AT DAWN
I BUSIED MYSELF FOR AN HOUR OR TWO
WITH ARRANGING MY THINGS IN MY CHAMBER DRAWERS AND WARDROBE IN THE
ORDER WHEREIN I SHOULD WISH TO LEAVE THEM DURING A BRIEF ABSENCE
MEANTIME I HEARD ST
JOHN QUIT HIS ROOM
HE STOPPED AT MY DOOR I
FEARED HE WOULD KNOCK NO BUT A SLIP OF PAPER WAS PASSED UNDER THE DOOR
I TOOK IT UP
IT BORE THESE WORDS
YOU LEFT ME TOO SUDDENLY LAST NIGHT
HAD YOU STAYED BUT A LITTLE
LONGER YOU WOULD HAVE LAID YOUR HAND ON THE CHRISTIAN'S CROSS AND THE
ANGEL'S CROWN
I SHALL EXPECT YOUR CLEAR DECISION WHEN I RETURN THIS DAY
FORTNIGHT
MEANTIME WATCH AND PRAY THAT YOU ENTER NOT INTO TEMPTATION
THE SPIRIT I TRUST IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH I SEE IS WEAK
I SHALL
PRAY FOR YOU HOURLY YOURS ST
JOHN
MY SPIRIT I ANSWERED MENTALLY IS WILLING TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND MY
FLESH I HOPE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO ACCOMPLISH THE WILL OF HEAVEN WHEN
ONCE THAT WILL IS DISTINCTLY KNOWN TO ME
AT ANY RATE IT SHALL BE
STRONG ENOUGH TO SEARCH INQUIRE TO GROPE AN OUTLET FROM THIS CLOUD OF
DOUBT AND FIND THE OPEN DAY OF CERTAINTY
IT WAS THE FIRST OF JUNE YET THE MORNING WAS OVERCAST AND CHILLY RAIN
BEAT FAST ON MY CASEMENT
I HEARD THE FRONT DOOR OPEN AND ST
JOHN PASS
OUT
LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW I SAW HIM TRAVERSE THE GARDEN
HE TOOK
THE WAY OVER THE MISTY MOORS IN THE DIRECTION OF WHITCROSS THERE HE
WOULD MEET THE COACH
IN A FEW MORE HOURS I SHALL SUCCEED YOU IN THAT TRACK COUSIN THOUGHT
I I TOO HAVE A COACH TO MEET AT WHITCROSS
I TOO HAVE SOME TO SEE AND
ASK AFTER IN ENGLAND BEFORE I DEPART FOR EVER
IT WANTED YET TWO HOURS OF BREAKFAST TIME
I FILLED THE INTERVAL IN
WALKING SOFTLY ABOUT MY ROOM AND PONDERING THE VISITATION WHICH HAD
GIVEN MY PLANS THEIR PRESENT BENT
I RECALLED THAT INWARD SENSATION I
HAD EXPERIENCED FOR I COULD RECALL IT WITH ALL ITS UNSPEAKABLE
STRANGENESS
I RECALLED THE VOICE I HAD HEARD AGAIN I QUESTIONED WHENCE
IT CAME AS VAINLY AS BEFORE IT SEEMED IN ME NOT IN THE EXTERNAL
WORLD
I ASKED WAS IT A MERE NERVOUS IMPRESSION A DELUSION I COULD
NOT CONCEIVE OR BELIEVE IT WAS MORE LIKE AN INSPIRATION
THE WONDROUS
SHOCK OF FEELING HAD COME LIKE THE EARTHQUAKE WHICH SHOOK THE FOUNDATIONS
OF PAUL AND SILAS'S PRISON IT HAD OPENED THE DOORS OF THE SOUL'S CELL
AND LOOSED ITS BANDS IT HAD WAKENED IT OUT OF ITS SLEEP WHENCE IT
SPRANG TREMBLING LISTENING AGHAST THEN VIBRATED THRICE A CRY ON MY
STARTLED EAR AND IN MY QUAKING HEART AND THROUGH MY SPIRIT WHICH
NEITHER FEARED NOR SHOOK BUT EXULTED AS IF IN JOY OVER THE SUCCESS OF
ONE EFFORT IT HAD BEEN PRIVILEGED TO MAKE INDEPENDENT OF THE CUMBROUS
BODY
ERE MANY DAYS I SAID AS I TERMINATED MY MUSINGS I WILL KNOW
SOMETHING OF HIM WHOSE VOICE SEEMED LAST NIGHT TO SUMMON ME
LETTERS
HAVE PROVED OF NO AVAIL PERSONAL INQUIRY SHALL REPLACE THEM
AT BREAKFAST I ANNOUNCED TO DIANA AND MARY THAT I WAS GOING A JOURNEY
AND SHOULD BE ABSENT AT LEAST FOUR DAYS
ALONE JANE THEY ASKED
YES IT WAS TO SEE OR HEAR NEWS OF A FRIEND ABOUT WHOM I HAD FOR SOME
TIME BEEN UNEASY
THEY MIGHT HAVE SAID AS I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD
BELIEVED ME TO BE WITHOUT ANY FRIENDS SAVE THEM FOR INDEED I HAD OFTEN
SAID SO BUT WITH THEIR TRUE NATURAL DELICACY THEY ABSTAINED FROM
COMMENT EXCEPT THAT DIANA ASKED ME IF I WAS SURE I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO
TRAVEL
I LOOKED VERY PALE SHE OBSERVED
I REPLIED THAT NOTHING AILED
ME SAVE ANXIETY OF MIND WHICH I HOPED SOON TO ALLEVIATE
IT WAS EASY TO MAKE MY FURTHER ARRANGEMENTS FOR I WAS TROUBLED WITH NO
INQUIRIES NO SURMISES
HAVING ONCE EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT I COULD NOT
NOW BE EXPLICIT ABOUT MY PLANS THEY KINDLY AND WISELY ACQUIESCED IN THE
SILENCE WITH WHICH I PURSUED THEM ACCORDING TO ME THE PRIVILEGE OF FREE
ACTION I SHOULD UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE ACCORDED THEM
I LEFT MOOR HOUSE AT THREE O'CLOCK P M AND SOON AFTER FOUR I STOOD AT
THE FOOT OF THE SIGN POST OF WHITCROSS WAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THE COACH
WHICH WAS TO TAKE ME TO DISTANT THORNFIELD
AMIDST THE SILENCE OF THOSE
SOLITARY ROADS AND DESERT HILLS I HEARD IT APPROACH FROM A GREAT
DISTANCE
IT WAS THE SAME VEHICLE WHENCE A YEAR AGO I HAD ALIGHTED ONE
SUMMER EVENING ON THIS VERY SPOT HOW DESOLATE AND HOPELESS AND
OBJECTLESS IT STOPPED AS I BECKONED
I ENTERED NOT NOW OBLIGED TO
PART WITH MY WHOLE FORTUNE AS THE PRICE OF ITS ACCOMMODATION
ONCE MORE
ON THE ROAD TO THORNFIELD I FELT LIKE THE MESSENGER PIGEON FLYING HOME
IT WAS A JOURNEY OF SIX AND THIRTY HOURS
I HAD SET OUT FROM WHITCROSS
ON A TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY ON THE SUCCEEDING THURSDAY MORNING THE
COACH STOPPED TO WATER THE HORSES AT A WAYSIDE INN SITUATED IN THE MIDST
OF SCENERY WHOSE GREEN HEDGES AND LARGE FIELDS AND LOW PASTORAL HILLS
HOW MILD OF FEATURE AND VERDANT OF HUE COMPARED WITH THE STERN NORTH
MIDLAND MOORS OF MORTON MET MY EYE LIKE THE LINEAMENTS OF A ONCE
FAMILIAR FACE
YES I KNEW THE CHARACTER OF THIS LANDSCAPE I WAS SURE
WE WERE NEAR MY BOURNE
HOW FAR IS THORNFIELD HALL FROM HERE I ASKED OF THE OSTLER
JUST TWO MILES MA'AM ACROSS THE FIELDS
MY JOURNEY IS CLOSED I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
I GOT OUT OF THE COACH
GAVE A BOX I HAD INTO THE OSTLER'S CHARGE TO BE KEPT TILL I CALLED FOR
IT PAID MY FARE SATISFIED THE COACHMAN AND WAS GOING THE BRIGHTENING
DAY GLEAMED ON THE SIGN OF THE INN AND I READ IN GILT LETTERS THE
ROCHESTER ARMS MY HEART LEAPT UP I WAS ALREADY ON MY MASTER'S VERY
LANDS
IT FELL AGAIN THE THOUGHT STRUCK IT
YOUR MASTER HIMSELF MAY BE BEYOND THE BRITISH CHANNEL FOR AUGHT YOU
KNOW AND THEN IF HE IS AT THORNFIELD HALL TOWARDS WHICH YOU HASTEN
WHO BESIDES HIM IS THERE HIS LUNATIC WIFE AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIM YOU DARE NOT SPEAK TO HIM OR SEEK HIS PRESENCE
YOU HAVE LOST
YOUR LABOUR YOU HAD BETTER GO NO FARTHER URGED THE MONITOR
ASK
INFORMATION OF THE PEOPLE AT THE INN THEY CAN GIVE YOU ALL YOU SEEK
THEY CAN SOLVE YOUR DOUBTS AT ONCE
GO UP TO THAT MAN AND INQUIRE IF
MR
ROCHESTER BE AT HOME
THE SUGGESTION WAS SENSIBLE AND YET I COULD NOT FORCE MYSELF TO ACT ON
IT
I SO DREADED A REPLY THAT WOULD CRUSH ME WITH DESPAIR
TO PROLONG
DOUBT WAS TO PROLONG HOPE
I MIGHT YET ONCE MORE SEE THE HALL UNDER THE
RAY OF HER STAR
THERE WAS THE STILE BEFORE ME THE VERY FIELDS THROUGH
WHICH I HAD HURRIED BLIND DEAF DISTRACTED WITH A REVENGEFUL FURY
TRACKING AND SCOURGING ME ON THE MORNING I FLED FROM THORNFIELD ERE I
WELL KNEW WHAT COURSE I HAD RESOLVED TO TAKE I WAS IN THE MIDST OF THEM
HOW FAST I WALKED HOW I RAN SOMETIMES HOW I LOOKED FORWARD TO CATCH
THE FIRST VIEW OF THE WELL KNOWN WOODS WITH WHAT FEELINGS I WELCOMED
SINGLE TREES I KNEW AND FAMILIAR GLIMPSES OF MEADOW AND HILL BETWEEN
THEM
AT LAST THE WOODS ROSE THE ROOKERY CLUSTERED DARK A LOUD CAWING BROKE
THE MORNING STILLNESS
STRANGE DELIGHT INSPIRED ME ON I HASTENED
ANOTHER FIELD CROSSED A LANE THREADED AND THERE WERE THE COURTYARD
WALLS THE BACK OFFICES THE HOUSE ITSELF THE ROOKERY STILL HID
MY
FIRST VIEW OF IT SHALL BE IN FRONT I DETERMINED WHERE ITS BOLD
BATTLEMENTS WILL STRIKE THE EYE NOBLY AT ONCE AND WHERE I CAN SINGLE OUT
MY MASTER'S VERY WINDOW PERHAPS HE WILL BE STANDING AT IT HE RISES
EARLY PERHAPS HE IS NOW WALKING IN THE ORCHARD OR ON THE PAVEMENT IN
FRONT
COULD I BUT SEE HIM BUT A MOMENT SURELY IN THAT CASE I
SHOULD NOT BE SO MAD AS TO RUN TO HIM I CANNOT TELL I AM NOT CERTAIN
AND IF I DID WHAT THEN GOD BLESS HIM WHAT THEN WHO WOULD BE HURT
BY MY ONCE MORE TASTING THE LIFE HIS GLANCE CAN GIVE ME I RAVE PERHAPS
AT THIS MOMENT HE IS WATCHING THE SUN RISE OVER THE PYRENEES OR ON THE
TIDELESS SEA OF THE SOUTH
I HAD COASTED ALONG THE LOWER WALL OF THE ORCHARD TURNED ITS ANGLE
THERE WAS A GATE JUST THERE OPENING INTO THE MEADOW BETWEEN TWO STONE
PILLARS CROWNED BY STONE BALLS
FROM BEHIND ONE PILLAR I COULD PEEP
ROUND QUIETLY AT THE FULL FRONT OF THE MANSION
I ADVANCED MY HEAD WITH
PRECAUTION DESIROUS TO ASCERTAIN IF ANY BEDROOM WINDOW BLINDS WERE YET
DRAWN UP BATTLEMENTS WINDOWS LONG FRONT ALL FROM THIS SHELTERED
STATION WERE AT MY COMMAND
THE CROWS SAILING OVERHEAD PERHAPS WATCHED ME WHILE I TOOK THIS SURVEY
I
WONDER WHAT THEY THOUGHT
THEY MUST HAVE CONSIDERED I WAS VERY CAREFUL
AND TIMID AT FIRST AND THAT GRADUALLY I GREW VERY BOLD AND RECKLESS
A
PEEP AND THEN A LONG STARE AND THEN A DEPARTURE FROM MY NICHE AND A
STRAYING OUT INTO THE MEADOW AND A SUDDEN STOP FULL IN FRONT OF THE
GREAT MANSION AND A PROTRACTED HARDY GAZE TOWARDS IT
WHAT
AFFECTATION OF DIFFIDENCE WAS THIS AT FIRST THEY MIGHT HAVE DEMANDED
WHAT STUPID REGARDLESSNESS NOW
HEAR AN ILLUSTRATION READER
A LOVER FINDS HIS MISTRESS ASLEEP ON A MOSSY BANK HE WISHES TO CATCH A
GLIMPSE OF HER FAIR FACE WITHOUT WAKING HER
HE STEALS SOFTLY OVER THE
GRASS CAREFUL TO MAKE NO SOUND HE PAUSES FANCYING SHE HAS STIRRED HE
WITHDRAWS NOT FOR WORLDS WOULD HE BE SEEN
ALL IS STILL HE AGAIN
ADVANCES HE BENDS ABOVE HER A LIGHT VEIL RESTS ON HER FEATURES HE
LIFTS IT BENDS LOWER NOW HIS EYES ANTICIPATE THE VISION OF BEAUTY WARM
AND BLOOMING AND LOVELY IN REST
HOW HURRIED WAS THEIR FIRST GLANCE
BUT HOW THEY FIX HOW HE STARTS HOW HE SUDDENLY AND VEHEMENTLY CLASPS
IN BOTH ARMS THE FORM HE DARED NOT A MOMENT SINCE TOUCH WITH HIS
FINGER HOW HE CALLS ALOUD A NAME AND DROPS HIS BURDEN AND GAZES ON IT
WILDLY HE THUS GRASPS AND CRIES AND GAZES BECAUSE HE NO LONGER FEARS
TO WAKEN BY ANY SOUND HE CAN UTTER BY ANY MOVEMENT HE CAN MAKE
HE
THOUGHT HIS LOVE SLEPT SWEETLY HE FINDS SHE IS STONE DEAD
I LOOKED WITH TIMOROUS JOY TOWARDS A STATELY HOUSE I SAW A BLACKENED
RUIN
NO NEED TO COWER BEHIND A GATE POST INDEED TO PEEP UP AT CHAMBER
LATTICES FEARING LIFE WAS ASTIR BEHIND THEM NO NEED TO LISTEN FOR
DOORS OPENING TO FANCY STEPS ON THE PAVEMENT OR THE GRAVEL WALK THE
LAWN THE GROUNDS WERE TRODDEN AND WASTE THE PORTAL YAWNED VOID
THE
FRONT WAS AS I HAD ONCE SEEN IT IN A DREAM BUT A WELL LIKE WALL VERY
HIGH AND VERY FRAGILE LOOKING PERFORATED WITH PANELESS WINDOWS NO ROOF
NO BATTLEMENTS NO CHIMNEYS ALL HAD CRASHED IN
AND THERE WAS THE SILENCE OF DEATH ABOUT IT THE SOLITUDE OF A LONESOME
WILD
NO WONDER THAT LETTERS ADDRESSED TO PEOPLE HERE HAD NEVER RECEIVED
AN ANSWER AS WELL DESPATCH EPISTLES TO A VAULT IN A CHURCH AISLE
THE
GRIM BLACKNESS OF THE STONES TOLD BY WHAT FATE THE HALL HAD FALLEN BY
CONFLAGRATION BUT HOW KINDLED WHAT STORY BELONGED TO THIS DISASTER
WHAT LOSS BESIDES MORTAR AND MARBLE AND WOOD WORK HAD FOLLOWED UPON IT
HAD LIFE BEEN WRECKED AS WELL AS PROPERTY IF SO WHOSE DREADFUL
QUESTION THERE WAS NO ONE HERE TO ANSWER IT NOT EVEN DUMB SIGN MUTE
TOKEN
IN WANDERING ROUND THE SHATTERED WALLS AND THROUGH THE DEVASTATED
INTERIOR I GATHERED EVIDENCE THAT THE CALAMITY WAS NOT OF LATE
OCCURRENCE
WINTER SNOWS I THOUGHT HAD DRIFTED THROUGH THAT VOID ARCH
WINTER RAINS BEATEN IN AT THOSE HOLLOW CASEMENTS FOR AMIDST THE
DRENCHED PILES OF RUBBISH SPRING HAD CHERISHED VEGETATION GRASS AND
WEED GREW HERE AND THERE BETWEEN THE STONES AND FALLEN RAFTERS
AND OH
WHERE MEANTIME WAS THE HAPLESS OWNER OF THIS WRECK IN WHAT LAND UNDER
WHAT AUSPICES MY EYE INVOLUNTARILY WANDERED TO THE GREY CHURCH TOWER
NEAR THE GATES AND I ASKED IS HE WITH DAMER DE ROCHESTER SHARING THE
SHELTER OF HIS NARROW MARBLE HOUSE
SOME ANSWER MUST BE HAD TO THESE QUESTIONS
I COULD FIND IT NOWHERE BUT
AT THE INN AND THITHER ERE LONG I RETURNED
THE HOST HIMSELF BROUGHT
MY BREAKFAST INTO THE PARLOUR
I REQUESTED HIM TO SHUT THE DOOR AND SIT
DOWN I HAD SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK HIM
BUT WHEN HE COMPLIED I SCARCELY
KNEW HOW TO BEGIN SUCH HORROR HAD I OF THE POSSIBLE ANSWERS
AND YET
THE SPECTACLE OF DESOLATION I HAD JUST LEFT PREPARED ME IN A MEASURE FOR
A TALE OF MISERY
THE HOST WAS A RESPECTABLE LOOKING MIDDLE AGED MAN
YOU KNOW THORNFIELD HALL OF COURSE I MANAGED TO SAY AT LAST
YES MA'AM I LIVED THERE ONCE
DID YOU NOT IN MY TIME I THOUGHT YOU ARE A STRANGER TO ME
I WAS THE LATE MR
ROCHESTER'S BUTLER HE ADDED
THE LATE I SEEM TO HAVE RECEIVED WITH FULL FORCE THE BLOW I HAD BEEN
TRYING TO EVADE
THE LATE I GASPED
IS HE DEAD
I MEAN THE PRESENT GENTLEMAN MR
EDWARD'S FATHER HE EXPLAINED
I
BREATHED AGAIN MY BLOOD RESUMED ITS FLOW
FULLY ASSURED BY THESE WORDS
THAT MR
EDWARD MY MR
ROCHESTER GOD BLESS HIM WHEREVER HE WAS WAS
AT LEAST ALIVE WAS IN SHORT THE PRESENT GENTLEMAN GLADDENING
WORDS IT SEEMED I COULD HEAR ALL THAT WAS TO COME WHATEVER THE
DISCLOSURES MIGHT BE WITH COMPARATIVE TRANQUILLITY
SINCE HE WAS NOT IN
THE GRAVE I COULD BEAR I THOUGHT TO LEARN THAT HE WAS AT THE
ANTIPODES
IS MR
ROCHESTER LIVING AT THORNFIELD HALL NOW I ASKED KNOWING OF
COURSE WHAT THE ANSWER WOULD BE BUT YET DESIROUS OF DEFERRING THE
DIRECT QUESTION AS TO WHERE HE REALLY WAS
NO MA'AM OH NO NO ONE IS LIVING THERE
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE A
STRANGER IN THESE PARTS OR YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD WHAT HAPPENED LAST
AUTUMN THORNFIELD HALL IS QUITE A RUIN IT WAS BURNT DOWN JUST ABOUT
HARVEST TIME
A DREADFUL CALAMITY SUCH AN IMMENSE QUANTITY OF VALUABLE
PROPERTY DESTROYED HARDLY ANY OF THE FURNITURE COULD BE SAVED
THE FIRE
BROKE OUT AT DEAD OF NIGHT AND BEFORE THE ENGINES ARRIVED FROM MILLCOTE
THE BUILDING WAS ONE MASS OF FLAME
IT WAS A TERRIBLE SPECTACLE I
WITNESSED IT MYSELF
AT DEAD OF NIGHT I MUTTERED
YES THAT WAS EVER THE HOUR OF FATALITY
AT THORNFIELD
WAS IT KNOWN HOW IT ORIGINATED I DEMANDED
THEY GUESSED MA'AM THEY GUESSED
INDEED I SHOULD SAY IT WAS
ASCERTAINED BEYOND A DOUBT
YOU ARE NOT PERHAPS AWARE HE CONTINUED
EDGING HIS CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER THE TABLE AND SPEAKING LOW THAT THERE
WAS A LADY A A LUNATIC KEPT IN THE HOUSE
I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF IT
SHE WAS KEPT IN VERY CLOSE CONFINEMENT MA'AM PEOPLE EVEN FOR SOME
YEARS WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF HER EXISTENCE
NO ONE SAW HER THEY
ONLY KNEW BY RUMOUR THAT SUCH A PERSON WAS AT THE HALL AND WHO OR WHAT
SHE WAS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONJECTURE
THEY SAID MR
EDWARD HAD BROUGHT
HER FROM ABROAD AND SOME BELIEVED SHE HAD BEEN HIS MISTRESS
BUT A
QUEER THING HAPPENED A YEAR SINCE A VERY QUEER THING
I FEARED NOW TO HEAR MY OWN STORY
I ENDEAVOURED TO RECALL HIM TO THE
MAIN FACT
AND THIS LADY
THIS LADY MA'AM HE ANSWERED TURNED OUT TO BE MR
ROCHESTER'S WIFE
THE DISCOVERY WAS BROUGHT ABOUT IN THE STRANGEST WAY
THERE WAS A YOUNG
LADY A GOVERNESS AT THE HALL THAT MR
ROCHESTER FELL IN
BUT THE FIRE I SUGGESTED
I'M COMING TO THAT MA'AM THAT MR
EDWARD FELL IN LOVE WITH
THE
SERVANTS SAY THEY NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO MUCH IN LOVE AS HE WAS HE WAS
AFTER HER CONTINUALLY
THEY USED TO WATCH HIM SERVANTS WILL YOU KNOW
MA'AM AND HE SET STORE ON HER PAST EVERYTHING FOR ALL NOBODY BUT HIM
THOUGHT HER SO VERY HANDSOME
SHE WAS A LITTLE SMALL THING THEY SAY
ALMOST LIKE A CHILD
I NEVER SAW HER MYSELF BUT I'VE HEARD LEAH THE
HOUSE MAID TELL OF HER
LEAH LIKED HER WELL ENOUGH
MR
ROCHESTER WAS
ABOUT FORTY AND THIS GOVERNESS NOT TWENTY AND YOU SEE WHEN GENTLEMEN
OF HIS AGE FALL IN LOVE WITH GIRLS THEY ARE OFTEN LIKE AS IF THEY WERE
BEWITCHED
WELL HE WOULD MARRY HER
YOU SHALL TELL ME THIS PART OF THE STORY ANOTHER TIME I SAID BUT NOW
I HAVE A PARTICULAR REASON FOR WISHING TO HEAR ALL ABOUT THE FIRE
WAS
IT SUSPECTED THAT THIS LUNATIC MRS
ROCHESTER HAD ANY HAND IN IT
YOU'VE HIT IT MA'AM IT'S QUITE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS HER AND NOBODY BUT
HER THAT SET IT GOING
SHE HAD A WOMAN TO TAKE CARE OF HER CALLED MRS
POOLE AN ABLE WOMAN IN HER LINE AND VERY TRUSTWORTHY BUT FOR ONE
FAULT A FAULT COMMON TO A DEAL OF THEM NURSES AND MATRONS SHE KEPT A
PRIVATE BOTTLE OF GIN BY HER AND NOW AND THEN TOOK A DROP OVER MUCH
IT
IS EXCUSABLE FOR SHE HAD A HARD LIFE OF IT BUT STILL IT WAS DANGEROUS
FOR WHEN MRS
POOLE WAS FAST ASLEEP AFTER THE GIN AND WATER THE MAD
LADY WHO WAS AS CUNNING AS A WITCH WOULD TAKE THE KEYS OUT OF HER
POCKET LET HERSELF OUT OF HER CHAMBER AND GO ROAMING ABOUT THE HOUSE
DOING ANY WILD MISCHIEF THAT CAME INTO HER HEAD
THEY SAY SHE HAD NEARLY
BURNT HER HUSBAND IN HIS BED ONCE BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
HOWEVER
ON THIS NIGHT SHE SET FIRE FIRST TO THE HANGINGS OF THE ROOM NEXT HER
OWN AND THEN SHE GOT DOWN TO A LOWER STOREY AND MADE HER WAY TO THE
CHAMBER THAT HAD BEEN THE GOVERNESS'S SHE WAS LIKE AS IF SHE KNEW
SOMEHOW HOW MATTERS HAD GONE ON AND HAD A SPITE AT HER AND SHE KINDLED
THE BED THERE BUT THERE WAS NOBODY SLEEPING IN IT FORTUNATELY
THE
GOVERNESS HAD RUN AWAY TWO MONTHS BEFORE AND FOR ALL MR
ROCHESTER
SOUGHT HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN THE MOST PRECIOUS THING HE HAD IN THE
WORLD HE NEVER COULD HEAR A WORD OF HER AND HE GREW SAVAGE QUITE
SAVAGE ON HIS DISAPPOINTMENT HE NEVER WAS A WILD MAN BUT HE GOT
DANGEROUS AFTER HE LOST HER
HE WOULD BE ALONE TOO
HE SENT MRS
FAIRFAX THE HOUSEKEEPER AWAY TO HER FRIENDS AT A DISTANCE BUT HE DID
IT HANDSOMELY FOR HE SETTLED AN ANNUITY ON HER FOR LIFE AND SHE
DESERVED IT SHE WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN
MISS ADELE A WARD HE HAD WAS
PUT TO SCHOOL
HE BROKE OFF ACQUAINTANCE WITH ALL THE GENTRY AND SHUT
HIMSELF UP LIKE A HERMIT AT THE HALL
WHAT DID HE NOT LEAVE ENGLAND
LEAVE ENGLAND BLESS YOU NO HE WOULD NOT CROSS THE DOOR STONES OF
THE HOUSE EXCEPT AT NIGHT WHEN HE WALKED JUST LIKE A GHOST ABOUT THE
GROUNDS AND IN THE ORCHARD AS IF HE HAD LOST HIS SENSES WHICH IT IS MY
OPINION HE HAD FOR A MORE SPIRITED BOLDER KEENER GENTLEMAN THAN HE WAS
BEFORE THAT MIDGE OF A GOVERNESS CROSSED HIM YOU NEVER SAW MA'AM
HE
WAS NOT A MAN GIVEN TO WINE OR CARDS OR RACING AS SOME ARE AND HE WAS
NOT SO VERY HANDSOME BUT HE HAD A COURAGE AND A WILL OF HIS OWN IF EVER
MAN HAD
I KNEW HIM FROM A BOY YOU SEE AND FOR MY PART I HAVE OFTEN
WISHED THAT MISS EYRE HAD BEEN SUNK IN THE SEA BEFORE SHE CAME TO
THORNFIELD HALL
THEN MR
ROCHESTER WAS AT HOME WHEN THE FIRE BROKE OUT
YES INDEED WAS HE AND HE WENT UP TO THE ATTICS WHEN ALL WAS BURNING
ABOVE AND BELOW AND GOT THE SERVANTS OUT OF THEIR BEDS AND HELPED THEM
DOWN HIMSELF AND WENT BACK TO GET HIS MAD WIFE OUT OF HER CELL
AND
THEN THEY CALLED OUT TO HIM THAT SHE WAS ON THE ROOF WHERE SHE WAS
STANDING WAVING HER ARMS ABOVE THE BATTLEMENTS AND SHOUTING OUT TILL
THEY COULD HEAR HER A MILE OFF I SAW HER AND HEARD HER WITH MY OWN EYES
SHE WAS A BIG WOMAN AND HAD LONG BLACK HAIR WE COULD SEE IT STREAMING
AGAINST THE FLAMES AS SHE STOOD
I WITNESSED AND SEVERAL MORE
WITNESSED MR
ROCHESTER ASCEND THROUGH THE SKY LIGHT ON TO THE ROOF WE
HEARD HIM CALL 'BERTHA WE SAW HIM APPROACH HER AND THEN MA'AM SHE
YELLED AND GAVE A SPRING AND THE NEXT MINUTE SHE LAY SMASHED ON THE
PAVEMENT
THE NEXT MINUTE SHE LAY SMASHED ON THE PAVEMENT P413 JPG
DEAD
DEAD AY DEAD AS THE STONES ON WHICH HER BRAINS AND BLOOD WERE
SCATTERED
GOOD GOD
YOU MAY WELL SAY SO MA'AM IT WAS FRIGHTFUL
HE SHUDDERED
AND AFTERWARDS I URGED
WELL MA'AM AFTERWARDS THE HOUSE WAS BURNT TO THE GROUND THERE ARE
ONLY SOME BITS OF WALLS STANDING NOW
WERE ANY OTHER LIVES LOST
NO PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THERE HAD
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
POOR MR
EDWARD HE EJACULATED I LITTLE THOUGHT EVER TO HAVE SEEN IT
SOME SAY IT WAS A JUST JUDGMENT ON HIM FOR KEEPING HIS FIRST MARRIAGE
SECRET AND WANTING TO TAKE ANOTHER WIFE WHILE HE HAD ONE LIVING BUT I
PITY HIM FOR MY PART
YOU SAID HE WAS ALIVE I EXCLAIMED
YES YES HE IS ALIVE BUT MANY THINK HE HAD BETTER BE DEAD
WHY HOW MY BLOOD WAS AGAIN RUNNING COLD
WHERE IS HE I
DEMANDED
IS HE IN ENGLAND
AY AY HE'S IN ENGLAND HE CAN'T GET OUT OF ENGLAND I FANCY HE'S A
FIXTURE NOW
WHAT AGONY WAS THIS AND THE MAN SEEMED RESOLVED TO PROTRACT IT
HE IS STONE BLIND HE SAID AT LAST
YES HE IS STONE BLIND IS MR
EDWARD
I HAD DREADED WORSE
I HAD DREADED HE WAS MAD
I SUMMONED STRENGTH TO
ASK WHAT HAD CAUSED THIS CALAMITY
IT WAS ALL HIS OWN COURAGE AND A BODY MAY SAY HIS KINDNESS IN A WAY
MA'AM HE WOULDN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE TILL EVERY ONE ELSE WAS OUT BEFORE
HIM
AS HE CAME DOWN THE GREAT STAIRCASE AT LAST AFTER MRS
ROCHESTER
HAD FLUNG HERSELF FROM THE BATTLEMENTS THERE WAS A GREAT CRASH ALL
FELL
HE WAS TAKEN OUT FROM UNDER THE RUINS ALIVE BUT SADLY HURT A
BEAM HAD FALLEN IN SUCH A WAY AS TO PROTECT HIM PARTLY BUT ONE EYE WAS
KNOCKED OUT AND ONE HAND SO CRUSHED THAT MR
CARTER THE SURGEON HAD TO
AMPUTATE IT DIRECTLY
THE OTHER EYE INFLAMED HE LOST THE SIGHT OF THAT
ALSO
HE IS NOW HELPLESS INDEED BLIND AND A CRIPPLE
WHERE IS HE WHERE DOES HE NOW LIVE
AT FERNDEAN A MANOR HOUSE ON A FARM HE HAS ABOUT THIRTY MILES OFF
QUITE A DESOLATE SPOT
WHO IS WITH HIM
OLD JOHN AND HIS WIFE HE WOULD HAVE NONE ELSE
HE IS QUITE BROKEN
DOWN THEY SAY
HAVE YOU ANY SORT OF CONVEYANCE
WE HAVE A CHAISE MA'AM A VERY HANDSOME CHAISE
LET IT BE GOT READY INSTANTLY AND IF YOUR POST BOY CAN DRIVE ME TO
FERNDEAN BEFORE DARK THIS DAY I'LL PAY BOTH YOU AND HIM TWICE THE HIRE
YOU USUALLY DEMAND
CHAPTER XXXVII
THE MANOR HOUSE OF FERNDEAN WAS A BUILDING OF CONSIDERABLE ANTIQUITY
MODERATE SIZE AND NO ARCHITECTURAL PRETENSIONS DEEP BURIED IN A WOOD
I
HAD HEARD OF IT BEFORE
MR
ROCHESTER OFTEN SPOKE OF IT AND SOMETIMES
WENT THERE
HIS FATHER HAD PURCHASED THE ESTATE FOR THE SAKE OF THE GAME
COVERS
HE WOULD HAVE LET THE HOUSE BUT COULD FIND NO TENANT IN
CONSEQUENCE OF ITS INELIGIBLE AND INSALUBRIOUS SITE
FERNDEAN THEN
REMAINED UNINHABITED AND UNFURNISHED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME TWO OR
THREE ROOMS FITTED UP FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE SQUIRE WHEN HE WENT
THERE IN THE SEASON TO SHOOT
TO THIS HOUSE I CAME JUST ERE DARK ON AN EVENING MARKED BY THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF SAD SKY COLD GALE AND CONTINUED SMALL PENETRATING
RAIN
THE LAST MILE I PERFORMED ON FOOT HAVING DISMISSED THE CHAISE AND
DRIVER WITH THE DOUBLE REMUNERATION I HAD PROMISED
EVEN WHEN WITHIN A
VERY SHORT DISTANCE OF THE MANOR HOUSE YOU COULD SEE NOTHING OF IT SO
THICK AND DARK GREW THE TIMBER OF THE GLOOMY WOOD ABOUT IT
IRON GATES
BETWEEN GRANITE PILLARS SHOWED ME WHERE TO ENTER AND PASSING THROUGH
THEM I FOUND MYSELF AT ONCE IN THE TWILIGHT OF CLOSE RANKED TREES
THERE
WAS A GRASS GROWN TRACK DESCENDING THE FOREST AISLE BETWEEN HOAR AND
KNOTTY SHAFTS AND UNDER BRANCHED ARCHES
I FOLLOWED IT EXPECTING SOON
TO REACH THE DWELLING BUT IT STRETCHED ON AND ON IT WOUND FAR AND
FARTHER NO SIGN OF HABITATION OR GROUNDS WAS VISIBLE
I THOUGHT I HAD TAKEN A WRONG DIRECTION AND LOST MY WAY
THE DARKNESS OF
NATURAL AS WELL AS OF SYLVAN DUSK GATHERED OVER ME
I LOOKED ROUND IN
SEARCH OF ANOTHER ROAD
THERE WAS NONE ALL WAS INTERWOVEN STEM
COLUMNAR TRUNK DENSE SUMMER FOLIAGE NO OPENING ANYWHERE
I PROCEEDED AT LAST MY WAY OPENED THE TREES THINNED A LITTLE PRESENTLY
I BEHELD A RAILING THEN THE HOUSE SCARCE BY THIS DIM LIGHT
DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE TREES SO DANK AND GREEN WERE ITS DECAYING
WALLS
ENTERING A PORTAL FASTENED ONLY BY A LATCH I STOOD AMIDST A
SPACE OF ENCLOSED GROUND FROM WHICH THE WOOD SWEPT AWAY IN A SEMICIRCLE
THERE WERE NO FLOWERS NO GARDEN BEDS ONLY A BROAD GRAVEL WALK GIRDLING
A GRASS PLAT AND THIS SET IN THE HEAVY FRAME OF THE FOREST
THE HOUSE
PRESENTED TWO POINTED GABLES IN ITS FRONT THE WINDOWS WERE LATTICED AND
NARROW THE FRONT DOOR WAS NARROW TOO ONE STEP LED UP TO IT
THE WHOLE
LOOKED AS THE HOST OF THE ROCHESTER ARMS HAD SAID QUITE A DESOLATE
SPOT IT WAS AS STILL AS A CHURCH ON A WEEK DAY THE PATTERING RAIN ON
THE FOREST LEAVES WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN ITS VICINAGE
CAN THERE BE LIFE HERE I ASKED
YES LIFE OF SOME KIND THERE WAS FOR I HEARD A MOVEMENT THAT NARROW
FRONT DOOR WAS UNCLOSING AND SOME SHAPE WAS ABOUT TO ISSUE FROM THE
GRANGE
IT OPENED SLOWLY A FIGURE CAME OUT INTO THE TWILIGHT AND STOOD ON THE
STEP A MAN WITHOUT A HAT HE STRETCHED FORTH HIS HAND AS IF TO FEEL
WHETHER IT RAINED
DUSK AS IT WAS I HAD RECOGNISED HIM IT WAS MY
MASTER EDWARD FAIRFAX ROCHESTER AND NO OTHER
I STAYED MY STEP ALMOST MY BREATH AND STOOD TO WATCH HIM TO EXAMINE
HIM MYSELF UNSEEN AND ALAS TO HIM INVISIBLE
IT WAS A SUDDEN MEETING
AND ONE IN WHICH RAPTURE WAS KEPT WELL IN CHECK BY PAIN
I HAD NO
DIFFICULTY IN RESTRAINING MY VOICE FROM EXCLAMATION MY STEP FROM HASTY
ADVANCE
HIS FORM WAS OF THE SAME STRONG AND STALWART CONTOUR AS EVER HIS PORT
WAS STILL ERECT HIS HAIR WAS STILL RAVEN BLACK NOR WERE HIS FEATURES
ALTERED OR SUNK NOT IN ONE YEAR'S SPACE BY ANY SORROW COULD HIS
ATHLETIC STRENGTH BE QUELLED OR HIS VIGOROUS PRIME BLIGHTED
BUT IN HIS
COUNTENANCE I SAW A CHANGE THAT LOOKED DESPERATE AND BROODING THAT
REMINDED ME OF SOME WRONGED AND FETTERED WILD BEAST OR BIRD DANGEROUS TO
APPROACH IN HIS SULLEN WOE
THE CAGED EAGLE WHOSE GOLD RINGED EYES
CRUELTY HAS EXTINGUISHED MIGHT LOOK AS LOOKED THAT SIGHTLESS SAMSON
AND READER DO YOU THINK I FEARED HIM IN HIS BLIND FEROCITY IF YOU DO
YOU LITTLE KNOW ME
A SOFT HOPE BLEST WITH MY SORROW THAT SOON I SHOULD
DARE TO DROP A KISS ON THAT BROW OF ROCK AND ON THOSE LIPS SO STERNLY
SEALED BENEATH IT BUT NOT YET
I WOULD NOT ACCOST HIM YET
HE DESCENDED THE ONE STEP AND ADVANCED SLOWLY AND GROPINGLY TOWARDS THE
GRASS PLAT
WHERE WAS HIS DARING STRIDE NOW THEN HE PAUSED AS IF HE
KNEW NOT WHICH WAY TO TURN
HE LIFTED HIS HAND AND OPENED HIS EYELIDS
GAZED BLANK AND WITH A STRAINING EFFORT ON THE SKY AND TOWARD THE
AMPHITHEATRE OF TREES ONE SAW THAT ALL TO HIM WAS VOID DARKNESS
HE
STRETCHED HIS RIGHT HAND THE LEFT ARM THE MUTILATED ONE HE KEPT HIDDEN
IN HIS BOSOM HE SEEMED TO WISH BY TOUCH TO GAIN AN IDEA OF WHAT LAY
AROUND HIM HE MET BUT VACANCY STILL FOR THE TREES WERE SOME YARDS OFF
WHERE HE STOOD
HE RELINQUISHED THE ENDEAVOUR FOLDED HIS ARMS AND
STOOD QUIET AND MUTE IN THE RAIN NOW FALLING FAST ON HIS UNCOVERED HEAD
AT THIS MOMENT JOHN APPROACHED HIM FROM SOME QUARTER
WILL YOU TAKE MY ARM SIR HE SAID THERE IS A HEAVY SHOWER COMING ON
HAD YOU NOT BETTER GO IN
LET ME ALONE WAS THE ANSWER
JOHN WITHDREW WITHOUT HAVING OBSERVED ME
MR
ROCHESTER NOW TRIED TO
WALK ABOUT VAINLY ALL WAS TOO UNCERTAIN
HE GROPED HIS WAY BACK TO
THE HOUSE AND RE ENTERING IT CLOSED THE DOOR
I NOW DREW NEAR AND KNOCKED JOHN'S WIFE OPENED FOR ME
MARY I SAID
HOW ARE YOU
SHE STARTED AS IF SHE HAD SEEN A GHOST I CALMED HER
TO HER HURRIED IS
IT REALLY YOU MISS COME AT THIS LATE HOUR TO THIS LONELY PLACE I
ANSWERED BY TAKING HER HAND AND THEN I FOLLOWED HER INTO THE KITCHEN
WHERE JOHN NOW SAT BY A GOOD FIRE
I EXPLAINED TO THEM IN FEW WORDS
THAT I HAD HEARD ALL WHICH HAD HAPPENED SINCE I LEFT THORNFIELD AND THAT
I WAS COME TO SEE MR
ROCHESTER
I ASKED JOHN TO GO DOWN TO THE TURN
PIKE HOUSE WHERE I HAD DISMISSED THE CHAISE AND BRING MY TRUNK WHICH I
HAD LEFT THERE AND THEN WHILE I REMOVED MY BONNET AND SHAWL I
QUESTIONED MARY AS TO WHETHER I COULD BE ACCOMMODATED AT THE MANOR HOUSE
FOR THE NIGHT AND FINDING THAT ARRANGEMENTS TO THAT EFFECT THOUGH
DIFFICULT WOULD NOT BE IMPOSSIBLE I INFORMED HER I SHOULD STAY
JUST
AT THIS MOMENT THE PARLOUR BELL RANG
WHEN YOU GO IN SAID I TELL YOUR MASTER THAT A PERSON WISHES TO SPEAK
TO HIM BUT DO NOT GIVE MY NAME
I DON'T THINK HE WILL SEE YOU SHE ANSWERED HE REFUSES EVERYBODY
WHEN SHE RETURNED I INQUIRED WHAT HE HAD SAID
YOU ARE TO SEND IN YOUR
NAME AND YOUR BUSINESS SHE REPLIED
SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO FILL A GLASS
WITH WATER AND PLACE IT ON A TRAY TOGETHER WITH CANDLES
IS THAT WHAT HE RANG FOR I ASKED
YES HE ALWAYS HAS CANDLES BROUGHT IN AT DARK THOUGH HE IS BLIND
GIVE THE TRAY TO ME I WILL CARRY IT IN
I TOOK IT FROM HER HAND SHE POINTED ME OUT THE PARLOUR DOOR
THE TRAY
SHOOK AS I HELD IT THE WATER SPILT FROM THE GLASS MY HEART STRUCK MY
RIBS LOUD AND FAST
MARY OPENED THE DOOR FOR ME AND SHUT IT BEHIND ME
THIS PARLOUR LOOKED GLOOMY A NEGLECTED HANDFUL OF FIRE BURNT LOW IN THE
GRATE AND LEANING OVER IT WITH HIS HEAD SUPPORTED AGAINST THE HIGH
OLD FASHIONED MANTELPIECE APPEARED THE BLIND TENANT OF THE ROOM
HIS
OLD DOG PILOT LAY ON ONE SIDE REMOVED OUT OF THE WAY AND COILED UP AS
IF AFRAID OF BEING INADVERTENTLY TRODDEN UPON
PILOT PRICKED UP HIS EARS
WHEN I CAME IN THEN HE JUMPED UP WITH A YELP AND A WHINE AND BOUNDED
TOWARDS ME HE ALMOST KNOCKED THE TRAY FROM MY HANDS
I SET IT ON THE
TABLE THEN PATTED HIM AND SAID SOFTLY LIE DOWN MR
ROCHESTER
TURNED MECHANICALLY TO SEE WHAT THE COMMOTION WAS BUT AS HE SAW
NOTHING HE RETURNED AND SIGHED
GIVE ME THE WATER MARY HE SAID
I APPROACHED HIM WITH THE NOW ONLY HALF FILLED GLASS PILOT FOLLOWED ME
STILL EXCITED
WHAT IS THE MATTER HE INQUIRED
DOWN PILOT I AGAIN SAID
HE CHECKED THE WATER ON ITS WAY TO HIS
LIPS AND SEEMED TO LISTEN HE DRANK AND PUT THE GLASS DOWN
THIS IS
YOU MARY IS IT NOT
MARY IS IN THE KITCHEN I ANSWERED
HE PUT OUT HIS HAND WITH A QUICK GESTURE BUT NOT SEEING WHERE I STOOD
HE DID NOT TOUCH ME
WHO IS THIS WHO IS THIS HE DEMANDED TRYING
AS IT SEEMED TO SEE WITH THOSE SIGHTLESS EYES UNAVAILING AND
DISTRESSING ATTEMPT ANSWER ME SPEAK AGAIN HE ORDERED IMPERIOUSLY
AND ALOUD
WILL YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE WATER SIR I SPILT HALF OF WHAT WAS IN THE
GLASS I SAID
WHO IS IT WHAT IS IT WHO SPEAKS
PILOT KNOWS ME AND JOHN AND MARY KNOW I AM HERE
I CAME ONLY THIS
EVENING I ANSWERED
GREAT GOD WHAT DELUSION HAS COME OVER ME WHAT SWEET MADNESS HAS
SEIZED ME
NO DELUSION NO MADNESS YOUR MIND SIR IS TOO STRONG FOR DELUSION
YOUR HEALTH TOO SOUND FOR FRENZY
AND WHERE IS THE SPEAKER IS IT ONLY A VOICE OH I CANNOT SEE BUT
I MUST FEEL OR MY HEART WILL STOP AND MY BRAIN BURST
WHATEVER WHOEVER
YOU ARE BE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE TOUCH OR I CANNOT LIVE
HE GROPED I ARRESTED HIS WANDERING HAND AND PRISONED IT IN BOTH MINE
HER VERY FINGERS HE CRIED HER SMALL SLIGHT FINGERS IF SO THERE
MUST BE MORE OF HER
THE MUSCULAR HAND BROKE FROM MY CUSTODY MY ARM WAS SEIZED MY
SHOULDER NECK WAIST I WAS ENTWINED AND GATHERED TO HIM
IS IT JANE WHAT IS IT THIS IS HER SHAPE THIS IS HER SIZE
AND THIS HER VOICE I ADDED
SHE IS ALL HERE HER HEART TOO
GOD
BLESS YOU SIR I AM GLAD TO BE SO NEAR YOU AGAIN
JANE EYRE JANE EYRE WAS ALL HE SAID
MY DEAR MASTER I ANSWERED I AM JANE EYRE I HAVE FOUND YOU OUT I AM

YOU TOUCH ME SIR YOU HOLD ME AND FAST ENOUGH I AM NOT COLD LIKE A
CORPSE NOR VACANT LIKE AIR AM I
MY LIVING DARLING THESE ARE CERTAINLY HER LIMBS AND THESE HER
FEATURES BUT I CANNOT BE SO BLEST AFTER ALL MY MISERY
IT IS A DREAM
SUCH DREAMS AS I HAVE HAD AT NIGHT WHEN I HAVE CLASPED HER ONCE MORE TO
MY HEART AS I DO NOW AND KISSED HER AS THUS AND FELT THAT SHE LOVED
ME AND TRUSTED THAT SHE WOULD NOT LEAVE ME
WHICH I NEVER WILL SIR FROM THIS DAY
NEVER WILL SAYS THE VISION BUT I ALWAYS WOKE AND FOUND IT AN EMPTY
MOCKERY AND I WAS DESOLATE AND ABANDONED MY LIFE DARK LONELY
HOPELESS MY SOUL ATHIRST AND FORBIDDEN TO DRINK MY HEART FAMISHED AND
NEVER TO BE FED
GENTLE SOFT DREAM NESTLING IN MY ARMS NOW YOU WILL
FLY TOO AS YOUR SISTERS HAVE ALL FLED BEFORE YOU BUT KISS ME BEFORE
YOU GO EMBRACE ME JANE
THERE SIR AND THERE
I PRESSED MY LIPS TO HIS ONCE BRILLIANT AND NOW RAYLESS EYES I SWEPT HIS
HAIR FROM HIS BROW AND KISSED THAT TOO
HE SUDDENLY SEEMED TO AROUSE
HIMSELF THE CONVICTION OF THE REALITY OF ALL THIS SEIZED HIM
IT IS YOU IS IT JANE YOU ARE COME BACK TO ME THEN
I AM
AND YOU DO NOT LIE DEAD IN SOME DITCH UNDER SOME STREAM AND YOU ARE
NOT A PINING OUTCAST AMONGST STRANGERS
NO SIR I AM AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN NOW
INDEPENDENT WHAT DO YOU MEAN JANE
MY UNCLE IN MADEIRA IS DEAD AND HE LEFT ME FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS
AH THIS IS PRACTICAL THIS IS REAL HE CRIED I SHOULD NEVER DREAM

BESIDES THERE IS THAT PECULIAR VOICE OF HERS SO ANIMATING AND
PIQUANT AS WELL AS SOFT IT CHEERS MY WITHERED HEART IT PUTS LIFE INTO
IT WHAT JANET ARE YOU AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN A RICH WOMAN
IF YOU WON'T LET ME LIVE WITH YOU I CAN BUILD A HOUSE OF MY OWN CLOSE
UP TO YOUR DOOR AND YOU MAY COME AND SIT IN MY PARLOUR WHEN YOU WANT

CEASE TO LOOK SO MELANCHOLY MY DEAR MASTER YOU SHALL NOT
BE LEFT DESOLATE SO LONG AS I LIVE
HE REPLIED NOT HE SEEMED SERIOUS ABSTRACTED HE SIGHED HE HALF OPENED
HIS LIPS AS IF TO SPEAK HE CLOSED THEM AGAIN
I FELT A LITTLE
EMBARRASSED
PERHAPS I HAD TOO RASHLY OVER LEAPED CONVENTIONALITIES AND
HE LIKE ST
JOHN SAW IMPROPRIETY IN MY INCONSIDERATENESS
I HAD INDEED
MADE MY PROPOSAL FROM THE IDEA THAT HE WISHED AND WOULD ASK ME TO BE HIS
WIFE AN EXPECTATION NOT THE LESS CERTAIN BECAUSE UNEXPRESSED HAD
BUOYED ME UP THAT HE WOULD CLAIM ME AT ONCE AS HIS OWN
BUT NO HINT TO
THAT EFFECT ESCAPING HIM AND HIS COUNTENANCE BECOMING MORE OVERCAST I
SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALL WRONG AND WAS PERHAPS
PLAYING THE FOOL UNWITTINGLY AND I BEGAN GENTLY TO WITHDRAW MYSELF FROM
HIS ARMS BUT HE EAGERLY SNATCHED ME CLOSER
NO NO JANE YOU MUST NOT GO
NO I HAVE TOUCHED YOU HEARD YOU FELT
THE COMFORT OF YOUR PRESENCE THE SWEETNESS OF YOUR CONSOLATION I CANNOT
GIVE UP THESE JOYS
I HAVE LITTLE LEFT IN MYSELF I MUST HAVE YOU
THE
WORLD MAY LAUGH MAY CALL ME ABSURD SELFISH BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY
MY
VERY SOUL DEMANDS YOU IT WILL BE SATISFIED OR IT WILL TAKE DEADLY
VENGEANCE ON ITS FRAME
WELL SIR I WILL STAY WITH YOU I HAVE SAID SO
YES BUT YOU UNDERSTAND ONE THING BY STAYING WITH ME AND I UNDERSTAND
ANOTHER
YOU PERHAPS COULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO BE ABOUT MY HAND AND
CHAIR TO WAIT ON ME AS A KIND LITTLE NURSE FOR YOU HAVE AN AFFECTIONATE
HEART AND A GENEROUS SPIRIT WHICH PROMPT YOU TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR
THOSE YOU PITY AND THAT OUGHT TO SUFFICE FOR ME NO DOUBT
I SUPPOSE I
SHOULD NOW ENTERTAIN NONE BUT FATHERLY FEELINGS FOR YOU DO YOU THINK SO
COME TELL ME
I WILL THINK WHAT YOU LIKE SIR I AM CONTENT TO BE ONLY YOUR NURSE IF
YOU THINK IT BETTER
BUT YOU CANNOT ALWAYS BE MY NURSE JANET YOU ARE YOUNG YOU MUST MARRY
ONE DAY
I DON'T CARE ABOUT BEING MARRIED
YOU SHOULD CARE JANET IF I WERE WHAT I ONCE WAS I WOULD TRY TO MAKE
YOU CARE BUT A SIGHTLESS BLOCK
HE RELAPSED AGAIN INTO GLOOM
I ON THE CONTRARY BECAME MORE CHEERFUL
AND TOOK FRESH COURAGE THESE LAST WORDS GAVE ME AN INSIGHT AS TO WHERE
THE DIFFICULTY LAY AND AS IT WAS NO DIFFICULTY WITH ME I FELT QUITE
RELIEVED FROM MY PREVIOUS EMBARRASSMENT
I RESUMED A LIVELIER VEIN OF
CONVERSATION
IT IS TIME SOME ONE UNDERTOOK TO REHUMANISE YOU SAID I PARTING HIS
THICK AND LONG UNCUT LOCKS FOR I SEE YOU ARE BEING METAMORPHOSED INTO A
LION OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
YOU HAVE A 'FAUX AIR' OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR
IN THE FIELDS ABOUT YOU THAT IS CERTAIN YOUR HAIR REMINDS ME OF EAGLES'
FEATHERS WHETHER YOUR NAILS ARE GROWN LIKE BIRDS' CLAWS OR NOT I HAVE
NOT YET NOTICED
ON THIS ARM I HAVE NEITHER HAND NOR NAILS HE SAID DRAWING THE
MUTILATED LIMB FROM HIS BREAST AND SHOWING IT TO ME
IT IS A MERE
STUMP A GHASTLY SIGHT DON'T YOU THINK SO JANE
IT IS A PITY TO SEE IT AND A PITY TO SEE YOUR EYES AND THE SCAR OF
FIRE ON YOUR FOREHEAD AND THE WORST OF IT IS ONE IS IN DANGER OF LOVING
YOU TOO WELL FOR ALL THIS AND MAKING TOO MUCH OF YOU
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE REVOLTED JANE WHEN YOU SAW MY ARM AND MY
CICATRISED VISAGE
DID YOU DON'T TELL ME SO LEST I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING DISPARAGING TO
YOUR JUDGMENT
NOW LET ME LEAVE YOU AN INSTANT TO MAKE A BETTER FIRE
AND HAVE THE HEARTH SWEPT UP
CAN YOU TELL WHEN THERE IS A GOOD FIRE
YES WITH THE RIGHT EYE I SEE A GLOW A RUDDY HAZE
AND YOU SEE THE CANDLES
VERY DIMLY EACH IS A LUMINOUS CLOUD
CAN YOU SEE ME
NO MY FAIRY BUT I AM ONLY TOO THANKFUL TO HEAR AND FEEL YOU
WHEN DO YOU TAKE SUPPER
I NEVER TAKE SUPPER
BUT YOU SHALL HAVE SOME TO NIGHT
I AM HUNGRY SO ARE YOU I DARESAY
ONLY YOU FORGET
SUMMONING MARY I SOON HAD THE ROOM IN MORE CHEERFUL ORDER I PREPARED
HIM LIKEWISE A COMFORTABLE REPAST
MY SPIRITS WERE EXCITED AND WITH
PLEASURE AND EASE I TALKED TO HIM DURING SUPPER AND FOR A LONG TIME
AFTER
THERE WAS NO HARASSING RESTRAINT NO REPRESSING OF GLEE AND
VIVACITY WITH HIM FOR WITH HIM I WAS AT PERFECT EASE BECAUSE I KNEW I
SUITED HIM ALL I SAID OR DID SEEMED EITHER TO CONSOLE OR REVIVE HIM
DELIGHTFUL CONSCIOUSNESS IT BROUGHT TO LIFE AND LIGHT MY WHOLE NATURE
IN HIS PRESENCE I THOROUGHLY LIVED AND HE LIVED IN MINE
BLIND AS HE
WAS SMILES PLAYED OVER HIS FACE JOY DAWNED ON HIS FOREHEAD HIS
LINEAMENTS SOFTENED AND WARMED
AFTER SUPPER HE BEGAN TO ASK ME MANY QUESTIONS OF WHERE I HAD BEEN
WHAT I HAD BEEN DOING HOW I HAD FOUND HIM OUT BUT I GAVE HIM ONLY VERY
PARTIAL REPLIES IT WAS TOO LATE TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS THAT NIGHT
BESIDES I WISHED TO TOUCH NO DEEP THRILLING CHORD TO OPEN NO FRESH WELL
OF EMOTION IN HIS HEART MY SOLE PRESENT AIM WAS TO CHEER HIM
CHEERED
AS I HAVE SAID HE WAS AND YET BUT BY FITS
IF A MOMENT'S SILENCE BROKE
THE CONVERSATION HE WOULD TURN RESTLESS TOUCH ME THEN SAY JANE
YOU ARE ALTOGETHER A HUMAN BEING JANE YOU ARE CERTAIN OF THAT
YOU ARE ALTOGETHER A HUMAN BEING JANE YOU ARE CERTAIN OF THAT
P422 JPG
I CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELIEVE SO MR
ROCHESTER
YET HOW ON THIS DARK AND DOLEFUL EVENING COULD YOU SO SUDDENLY RISE ON
MY LONE HEARTH I STRETCHED MY HAND TO TAKE A GLASS OF WATER FROM A
HIRELING AND IT WAS GIVEN ME BY YOU I ASKED A QUESTION EXPECTING
JOHN'S WIFE TO ANSWER ME AND YOUR VOICE SPOKE AT MY EAR
BECAUSE I HAD COME IN IN MARY'S STEAD WITH THE TRAY
AND THERE IS ENCHANTMENT IN THE VERY HOUR I AM NOW SPENDING WITH YOU
WHO CAN TELL WHAT A DARK DREARY HOPELESS LIFE I HAVE DRAGGED ON FOR
MONTHS PAST DOING NOTHING EXPECTING NOTHING MERGING NIGHT IN DAY
FEELING BUT THE SENSATION OF COLD WHEN I LET THE FIRE GO OUT OF HUNGER
WHEN I FORGOT TO EAT AND THEN A CEASELESS SORROW AND AT TIMES A VERY
DELIRIUM OF DESIRE TO BEHOLD MY JANE AGAIN
YES FOR HER RESTORATION I
LONGED FAR MORE THAN FOR THAT OF MY LOST SIGHT
HOW CAN IT BE THAT JANE
IS WITH ME AND SAYS SHE LOVES ME WILL SHE NOT DEPART AS SUDDENLY AS
SHE CAME TO MORROW I FEAR I SHALL FIND HER NO MORE
A COMMONPLACE PRACTICAL REPLY OUT OF THE TRAIN OF HIS OWN DISTURBED
IDEAS WAS I WAS SURE THE BEST AND MOST REASSURING FOR HIM IN THIS
FRAME OF MIND
I PASSED MY FINGER OVER HIS EYEBROWS AND REMARKED THAT
THEY WERE SCORCHED AND THAT I WOULD APPLY SOMETHING WHICH WOULD MAKE
THEM GROW AS BROAD AND BLACK AS EVER
WHERE IS THE USE OF DOING ME GOOD IN ANY WAY BENEFICENT SPIRIT WHEN
AT SOME FATAL MOMENT YOU WILL AGAIN DESERT ME PASSING LIKE A SHADOW
WHITHER AND HOW TO ME UNKNOWN AND FOR ME REMAINING AFTERWARDS
UNDISCOVERABLE
HAVE YOU A POCKET COMB ABOUT YOU SIR
WHAT FOR JANE
JUST TO COMB OUT THIS SHAGGY BLACK MANE
I FIND YOU RATHER ALARMING
WHEN I EXAMINE YOU CLOSE AT HAND YOU TALK OF MY BEING A FAIRY BUT I AM
SURE YOU ARE MORE LIKE A BROWNIE
AM I HIDEOUS JANE
VERY SIR YOU ALWAYS WERE YOU KNOW
HUMPH THE WICKEDNESS HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN OUT OF YOU WHEREVER YOU HAVE
SOJOURNED
YET I HAVE BEEN WITH GOOD PEOPLE FAR BETTER THAN YOU A HUNDRED TIMES
BETTER PEOPLE POSSESSED OF IDEAS AND VIEWS YOU NEVER ENTERTAINED IN YOUR
LIFE QUITE MORE REFINED AND EXALTED
WHO THE DEUCE HAVE YOU BEEN WITH
IF YOU TWIST IN THAT WAY YOU WILL MAKE ME PULL THE HAIR OUT OF YOUR
HEAD AND THEN I THINK YOU WILL CEASE TO ENTERTAIN DOUBTS OF MY
SUBSTANTIALITY
WHO HAVE YOU BEEN WITH JANE
YOU SHALL NOT GET IT OUT OF ME TO NIGHT SIR YOU MUST WAIT TILL
TO MORROW TO LEAVE MY TALE HALF TOLD WILL YOU KNOW BE A SORT OF
SECURITY THAT I SHALL APPEAR AT YOUR BREAKFAST TABLE TO FINISH IT
BY
THE BYE I MUST MIND NOT TO RISE ON YOUR HEARTH WITH ONLY A GLASS OF
WATER THEN I MUST BRING AN EGG AT THE LEAST TO SAY NOTHING OF FRIED
HAM
YOU MOCKING CHANGELING FAIRY BORN AND HUMAN BRED YOU MAKE ME FEEL AS
I HAVE NOT FELT THESE TWELVE MONTHS
IF SAUL COULD HAVE HAD YOU FOR HIS
DAVID THE EVIL SPIRIT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXORCISED WITHOUT THE AID OF THE
HARP
THERE SIR YOU ARE REDD UP AND MADE DECENT
NOW I'LL LEAVE YOU I HAVE
BEEN TRAVELLING THESE LAST THREE DAYS AND I BELIEVE I AM TIRED
GOOD
NIGHT
JUST ONE WORD JANE WERE THERE ONLY LADIES IN THE HOUSE WHERE YOU HAVE
BEEN
I LAUGHED AND MADE MY ESCAPE STILL LAUGHING AS I RAN UPSTAIRS
A GOOD
IDEA I THOUGHT WITH GLEE
I SEE I HAVE THE MEANS OF FRETTING HIM OUT
OF HIS MELANCHOLY FOR SOME TIME TO COME
VERY EARLY THE NEXT MORNING I HEARD HIM UP AND ASTIR WANDERING FROM ONE
ROOM TO ANOTHER
AS SOON AS MARY CAME DOWN I HEARD THE QUESTION IS
MISS EYRE HERE THEN WHICH ROOM DID YOU PUT HER INTO WAS IT DRY IS
SHE UP GO AND ASK IF SHE WANTS ANYTHING AND WHEN SHE WILL COME DOWN
I CAME DOWN AS SOON AS I THOUGHT THERE WAS A PROSPECT OF BREAKFAST
ENTERING THE ROOM VERY SOFTLY I HAD A VIEW OF HIM BEFORE HE DISCOVERED
MY PRESENCE
IT WAS MOURNFUL INDEED TO WITNESS THE SUBJUGATION OF THAT
VIGOROUS SPIRIT TO A CORPOREAL INFIRMITY
HE SAT IN HIS CHAIR STILL
BUT NOT AT REST EXPECTANT EVIDENTLY THE LINES OF NOW HABITUAL SADNESS
MARKING HIS STRONG FEATURES
HIS COUNTENANCE REMINDED ONE OF A LAMP
QUENCHED WAITING TO BE RE LIT AND ALAS IT WAS NOT HIMSELF THAT COULD
NOW KINDLE THE LUSTRE OF ANIMATED EXPRESSION HE WAS DEPENDENT ON ANOTHER
FOR THAT OFFICE I HAD MEANT TO BE GAY AND CARELESS BUT THE
POWERLESSNESS OF THE STRONG MAN TOUCHED MY HEART TO THE QUICK STILL I
ACCOSTED HIM WITH WHAT VIVACITY I COULD
IT IS A BRIGHT SUNNY MORNING SIR I SAID
THE RAIN IS OVER AND
GONE AND THERE IS A TENDER SHINING AFTER IT YOU SHALL HAVE A WALK
SOON
I HAD WAKENED THE GLOW HIS FEATURES BEAMED
OH YOU ARE INDEED THERE MY SKYLARK COME TO ME
YOU ARE NOT GONE
NOT VANISHED I HEARD ONE OF YOUR KIND AN HOUR AGO SINGING HIGH OVER
THE WOOD BUT ITS SONG HAD NO MUSIC FOR ME ANY MORE THAN THE RISING SUN
HAD RAYS
ALL THE MELODY ON EARTH IS CONCENTRATED IN MY JANE'S TONGUE TO
MY EAR I AM GLAD IT IS NOT NATURALLY A SILENT ONE ALL THE SUNSHINE I
CAN FEEL IS IN HER PRESENCE
THE WATER STOOD IN MY EYES TO HEAR THIS AVOWAL OF HIS DEPENDENCE JUST AS
IF A ROYAL EAGLE CHAINED TO A PERCH SHOULD BE FORCED TO ENTREAT A
SPARROW TO BECOME ITS PURVEYOR
BUT I WOULD NOT BE LACHRYMOSE I DASHED
OFF THE SALT DROPS AND BUSIED MYSELF WITH PREPARING BREAKFAST
MOST OF THE MORNING WAS SPENT IN THE OPEN AIR
I LED HIM OUT OF THE WET
AND WILD WOOD INTO SOME CHEERFUL FIELDS I DESCRIBED TO HIM HOW
BRILLIANTLY GREEN THEY WERE HOW THE FLOWERS AND HEDGES LOOKED REFRESHED
HOW SPARKLINGLY BLUE WAS THE SKY
I SOUGHT A SEAT FOR HIM IN A HIDDEN
AND LOVELY SPOT A DRY STUMP OF A TREE NOR DID I REFUSE TO LET HIM WHEN
SEATED PLACE ME ON HIS KNEE
WHY SHOULD I WHEN BOTH HE AND I WERE
HAPPIER NEAR THAN APART PILOT LAY BESIDE US ALL WAS QUIET
HE BROKE
OUT SUDDENLY WHILE CLASPING ME IN HIS ARMS
CRUEL CRUEL DESERTER OH JANE WHAT DID I FEEL WHEN I DISCOVERED YOU
HAD FLED FROM THORNFIELD AND WHEN I COULD NOWHERE FIND YOU AND AFTER
EXAMINING YOUR APARTMENT ASCERTAINED THAT YOU HAD TAKEN NO MONEY NOR
ANYTHING WHICH COULD SERVE AS AN EQUIVALENT A PEARL NECKLACE I HAD
GIVEN YOU LAY UNTOUCHED IN ITS LITTLE CASKET YOUR TRUNKS WERE LEFT
CORDED AND LOCKED AS THEY HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE BRIDAL TOUR
WHAT
COULD MY DARLING DO I ASKED LEFT DESTITUTE AND PENNILESS AND WHAT DID
SHE DO LET ME HEAR NOW
THUS URGED I BEGAN THE NARRATIVE OF MY EXPERIENCE FOR THE LAST YEAR
I
SOFTENED CONSIDERABLY WHAT RELATED TO THE THREE DAYS OF WANDERING AND
STARVATION BECAUSE TO HAVE TOLD HIM ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN TO INFLICT
UNNECESSARY PAIN THE LITTLE I DID SAY LACERATED HIS FAITHFUL HEART
DEEPER THAN I WISHED
I SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIM THUS HE SAID WITHOUT ANY MEANS OF MAKING MY
WAY I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM MY INTENTION
I SHOULD HAVE CONFIDED IN HIM
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE FORCED ME TO BE HIS MISTRESS
VIOLENT AS HE HAD
SEEMED IN HIS DESPAIR HE IN TRUTH LOVED ME FAR TOO WELL AND TOO
TENDERLY TO CONSTITUTE HIMSELF MY TYRANT HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME HALF HIS
FORTUNE WITHOUT DEMANDING SO MUCH AS A KISS IN RETURN RATHER THAN I
SHOULD HAVE FLUNG MYSELF FRIENDLESS ON THE WIDE WORLD
I HAD ENDURED HE
WAS CERTAIN MORE THAN I HAD CONFESSED TO HIM
WELL WHATEVER MY SUFFERINGS HAD BEEN THEY WERE VERY SHORT I
ANSWERED AND THEN I PROCEEDED TO TELL HIM HOW I HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT
MOOR HOUSE HOW I HAD OBTAINED THE OFFICE OF SCHOOLMISTRESS C
THE
ACCESSION OF FORTUNE THE DISCOVERY OF MY RELATIONS FOLLOWED IN DUE
ORDER
OF COURSE ST
JOHN RIVERS' NAME CAME IN FREQUENTLY IN THE
PROGRESS OF MY TALE
WHEN I HAD DONE THAT NAME WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN
UP
THIS ST
JOHN THEN IS YOUR COUSIN
YES
YOU HAVE SPOKEN OF HIM OFTEN DO YOU LIKE HIM
HE WAS A VERY GOOD MAN SIR I COULD NOT HELP LIKING HIM
A GOOD MAN
DOES THAT MEAN A RESPECTABLE WELL CONDUCTED MAN OF FIFTY
OR WHAT DOES IT MEAN
ST JOHN WAS ONLY TWENTY NINE SIR
JEUNE ENCORE AS THE FRENCH SAY
IS HE A PERSON OF LOW STATURE
PHLEGMATIC AND PLAIN
A PERSON WHOSE GOODNESS CONSISTS RATHER IN HIS
GUILTLESSNESS OF VICE THAN IN HIS PROWESS IN VIRTUE
HE IS UNTIRINGLY ACTIVE
GREAT AND EXALTED DEEDS ARE WHAT HE LIVES TO
PERFORM
BUT HIS BRAIN THAT IS PROBABLY RATHER SOFT HE MEANS WELL BUT YOU
SHRUG YOUR SHOULDERS TO HEAR HIM TALK
HE TALKS LITTLE SIR WHAT HE DOES SAY IS EVER TO THE POINT
HIS BRAIN
IS FIRST RATE I SHOULD THINK NOT IMPRESSIBLE BUT VIGOROUS
IS HE AN ABLE MAN THEN
TRULY ABLE
A THOROUGHLY EDUCATED MAN
ST
JOHN IS AN ACCOMPLISHED AND PROFOUND SCHOLAR
HIS MANNERS I THINK YOU SAID ARE NOT TO YOUR TASTE PRIGGISH AND
PARSONIC
I NEVER MENTIONED HIS MANNERS BUT UNLESS I HAD A VERY BAD TASTE THEY
MUST SUIT IT THEY ARE POLISHED CALM AND GENTLEMANLIKE
HIS APPEARANCE I FORGET WHAT DESCRIPTION YOU GAVE OF HIS APPEARANCE A
SORT OF RAW CURATE HALF STRANGLED WITH HIS WHITE NECKCLOTH AND STILTED
UP ON HIS THICK SOLED HIGH LOWS EH
ST
JOHN DRESSES WELL
HE IS A HANDSOME MAN TALL FAIR WITH BLUE
EYES AND A GRECIAN PROFILE
ASIDE DAMN HIM TO ME DID YOU LIKE HIM JANE
YES MR
ROCHESTER I LIKED HIM BUT YOU ASKED ME THAT BEFORE
I PERCEIVED OF COURSE THE DRIFT OF MY INTERLOCUTOR
JEALOUSY HAD GOT
HOLD OF HIM SHE STUNG HIM BUT THE STING WAS SALUTARY IT GAVE HIM
RESPITE FROM THE GNAWING FANG OF MELANCHOLY
I WOULD NOT THEREFORE
IMMEDIATELY CHARM THE SNAKE
PERHAPS YOU WOULD RATHER NOT SIT ANY LONGER ON MY KNEE MISS EYRE WAS
THE NEXT SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTED OBSERVATION
WHY NOT MR
ROCHESTER
THE PICTURE YOU HAVE JUST DRAWN IS SUGGESTIVE OF A RATHER TOO
OVERWHELMING CONTRAST
YOUR WORDS HAVE DELINEATED VERY PRETTILY A
GRACEFUL APOLLO HE IS PRESENT TO YOUR IMAGINATION TALL FAIR BLUE
EYED AND WITH A GRECIAN PROFILE
YOUR EYES DWELL ON A VULCAN A REAL
BLACKSMITH BROWN BROAD SHOULDERED AND BLIND AND LAME INTO THE
BARGAIN
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE BUT YOU CERTAINLY ARE RATHER LIKE VULCAN
SIR
WELL YOU CAN LEAVE ME MA'AM BUT BEFORE YOU GO AND HE RETAINED ME BY
A FIRMER GRASP THAN EVER YOU WILL BE PLEASED JUST TO ANSWER ME A
QUESTION OR TWO HE PAUSED
WHAT QUESTIONS MR
ROCHESTER
THEN FOLLOWED THIS CROSS EXAMINATION
ST
JOHN MADE YOU SCHOOLMISTRESS OF MORTON BEFORE HE KNEW YOU WERE HIS
COUSIN
YES
YOU WOULD OFTEN SEE HIM HE WOULD VISIT THE SCHOOL SOMETIMES
DAILY
HE WOULD APPROVE OF YOUR PLANS JANE I KNOW THEY WOULD BE CLEVER FOR
YOU ARE A TALENTED CREATURE
HE APPROVED OF THEM YES
HE WOULD DISCOVER MANY THINGS IN YOU HE COULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED TO FIND
SOME OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE NOT ORDINARY
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
YOU HAD A LITTLE COTTAGE NEAR THE SCHOOL YOU SAY DID HE EVER COME
THERE TO SEE YOU
NOW AND THEN
OF AN EVENING
ONCE OR TWICE
A PAUSE
HOW LONG DID YOU RESIDE WITH HIM AND HIS SISTERS AFTER THE COUSINSHIP
WAS DISCOVERED
FIVE MONTHS
DID RIVERS SPEND MUCH TIME WITH THE LADIES OF HIS FAMILY
YES THE BACK PARLOUR WAS BOTH HIS STUDY AND OURS HE SAT NEAR THE
WINDOW AND WE BY THE TABLE
DID HE STUDY MUCH
A GOOD DEAL
WHAT
HINDOSTANEE
AND WHAT DID YOU DO MEANTIME
I LEARNT GERMAN AT FIRST
DID HE TEACH YOU
HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND GERMAN
DID HE TEACH YOU NOTHING
A LITTLE HINDOSTANEE
RIVERS TAUGHT YOU HINDOSTANEE
YES SIR
AND HIS SISTERS ALSO
NO
ONLY YOU
ONLY ME
DID YOU ASK TO LEARN
NO
HE WISHED TO TEACH YOU
YES
A SECOND PAUSE
WHY DID HE WISH IT OF WHAT USE COULD HINDOSTANEE BE TO YOU
HE INTENDED ME TO GO WITH HIM TO INDIA
AH HERE I REACH THE ROOT OF THE MATTER
HE WANTED YOU TO MARRY HIM
HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM
THAT IS A FICTION AN IMPUDENT INVENTION TO VEX ME
I BEG YOUR PARDON IT IS THE LITERAL TRUTH HE ASKED ME MORE THAN ONCE
AND WAS AS STIFF ABOUT URGING HIS POINT AS EVER YOU COULD BE
MISS EYRE I REPEAT IT YOU CAN LEAVE ME
HOW OFTEN AM I TO SAY THE
SAME THING WHY DO YOU REMAIN PERTINACIOUSLY PERCHED ON MY KNEE WHEN I
HAVE GIVEN YOU NOTICE TO QUIT
BECAUSE I AM COMFORTABLE THERE
NO JANE YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE THERE BECAUSE YOUR HEART IS NOT WITH
ME IT IS WITH THIS COUSIN THIS ST
JOHN
OH TILL THIS MOMENT I
THOUGHT MY LITTLE JANE WAS ALL MINE I HAD A BELIEF SHE LOVED ME EVEN
WHEN SHE LEFT ME THAT WAS AN ATOM OF SWEET IN MUCH BITTER
LONG AS WE
HAVE BEEN PARTED HOT TEARS AS I HAVE WEPT OVER OUR SEPARATION I NEVER
THOUGHT THAT WHILE I WAS MOURNING HER SHE WAS LOVING ANOTHER BUT IT IS
USELESS GRIEVING
JANE LEAVE ME GO AND MARRY RIVERS
SHAKE ME OFF THEN SIR PUSH ME AWAY FOR I'LL NOT LEAVE YOU OF MY OWN
ACCORD
JANE I EVER LIKE YOUR TONE OF VOICE IT STILL RENEWS HOPE IT SOUNDS SO
TRUTHFUL
WHEN I HEAR IT IT CARRIES ME BACK A YEAR
I FORGET THAT YOU
HAVE FORMED A NEW TIE
BUT I AM NOT A FOOL GO
WHERE MUST I GO SIR
YOUR OWN WAY WITH THE HUSBAND YOU HAVE CHOSEN
WHO IS THAT
YOU KNOW THIS ST
JOHN RIVERS
HE IS NOT MY HUSBAND NOR EVER WILL BE
HE DOES NOT LOVE ME I DO NOT
LOVE HIM
HE LOVES AS HE CAN LOVE AND THAT IS NOT AS YOU LOVE A
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY CALLED ROSAMOND
HE WANTED TO MARRY ME ONLY BECAUSE
HE THOUGHT I SHOULD MAKE A SUITABLE MISSIONARY'S WIFE WHICH SHE WOULD
NOT HAVE DONE
HE IS GOOD AND GREAT BUT SEVERE AND FOR ME COLD AS AN
ICEBERG
HE IS NOT LIKE YOU SIR I AM NOT HAPPY AT HIS SIDE NOR NEAR
HIM NOR WITH HIM
HE HAS NO INDULGENCE FOR ME NO FONDNESS
HE SEES
NOTHING ATTRACTIVE IN ME NOT EVEN YOUTH ONLY A FEW USEFUL MENTAL
POINTS THEN I MUST LEAVE YOU SIR TO GO TO HIM
I SHUDDERED INVOLUNTARILY AND CLUNG INSTINCTIVELY CLOSER TO MY BLIND BUT
BELOVED MASTER
HE SMILED
WHAT JANE IS THIS TRUE IS SUCH REALLY THE STATE OF MATTERS BETWEEN
YOU AND RIVERS
ABSOLUTELY SIR OH YOU NEED NOT BE JEALOUS I WANTED TO TEASE YOU A
LITTLE TO MAKE YOU LESS SAD I THOUGHT ANGER WOULD BE BETTER THAN GRIEF
BUT IF YOU WISH ME TO LOVE YOU COULD YOU BUT SEE HOW MUCH I DO LOVE
YOU YOU WOULD BE PROUD AND CONTENT
ALL MY HEART IS YOURS SIR IT
BELONGS TO YOU AND WITH YOU IT WOULD REMAIN WERE FATE TO EXILE THE REST
OF ME FROM YOUR PRESENCE FOR EVER
AGAIN AS HE KISSED ME PAINFUL THOUGHTS DARKENED HIS ASPECT
MY SEARED VISION MY CRIPPLED STRENGTH HE MURMURED REGRETFULLY
I CARESSED IN ORDER TO SOOTHE HIM
I KNEW OF WHAT HE WAS THINKING AND
WANTED TO SPEAK FOR HIM BUT DARED NOT
AS HE TURNED ASIDE HIS FACE A
MINUTE I SAW A TEAR SLIDE FROM UNDER THE SEALED EYELID AND TRICKLE DOWN
THE MANLY CHEEK
MY HEART SWELLED
I AM NO BETTER THAN THE OLD LIGHTNING STRUCK CHESTNUT TREE IN THORNFIELD
ORCHARD HE REMARKED ERE LONG
AND WHAT RIGHT WOULD THAT RUIN HAVE TO
BID A BUDDING WOODBINE COVER ITS DECAY WITH FRESHNESS
YOU ARE NO RUIN SIR NO LIGHTNING STRUCK TREE YOU ARE GREEN AND
VIGOROUS
PLANTS WILL GROW ABOUT YOUR ROOTS WHETHER YOU ASK THEM OR
NOT BECAUSE THEY TAKE DELIGHT IN YOUR BOUNTIFUL SHADOW AND AS THEY GROW
THEY WILL LEAN TOWARDS YOU AND WIND ROUND YOU BECAUSE YOUR STRENGTH
OFFERS THEM SO SAFE A PROP
AGAIN HE SMILED I GAVE HIM COMFORT
YOU SPEAK OF FRIENDS JANE HE ASKED
YES OF FRIENDS I ANSWERED RATHER HESITATINGLY FOR I KNEW I MEANT
MORE THAN FRIENDS BUT COULD NOT TELL WHAT OTHER WORD TO EMPLOY
HE
HELPED ME
AH JANE
BUT I WANT A WIFE
DO YOU SIR
YES IS IT NEWS TO YOU
OF COURSE YOU SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT BEFORE
IS IT UNWELCOME NEWS
THAT DEPENDS ON CIRCUMSTANCES SIR ON YOUR CHOICE
WHICH YOU SHALL MAKE FOR ME JANE

CHOOSE THEN SIR HER WHO LOVES YOU BEST
I WILL AT LEAST CHOOSE HER I LOVE BEST
JANE WILL YOU MARRY ME
YES SIR
A POOR BLIND MAN WHOM YOU WILL HAVE TO LEAD ABOUT BY THE HAND

A CRIPPLED MAN TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN YOU WHOM YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT
ON
YES SIR
TRULY JANE

OH MY DARLING GOD BLESS YOU AND REWARD YOU
MR
ROCHESTER IF EVER I DID A GOOD DEED IN MY LIFE IF EVER I THOUGHT A
GOOD THOUGHT IF EVER I PRAYED A SINCERE AND BLAMELESS PRAYER IF EVER I
WISHED A RIGHTEOUS WISH I AM REWARDED NOW
TO BE YOUR WIFE IS FOR ME
TO BE AS HAPPY AS I CAN BE ON EARTH
BECAUSE YOU DELIGHT IN SACRIFICE
SACRIFICE WHAT DO I SACRIFICE FAMINE FOR FOOD EXPECTATION FOR
CONTENT
TO BE PRIVILEGED TO PUT MY ARMS ROUND WHAT I VALUE TO PRESS MY
LIPS TO WHAT I LOVE TO REPOSE ON WHAT I TRUST IS THAT TO MAKE A
SACRIFICE IF SO THEN CERTAINLY I DELIGHT IN SACRIFICE
AND TO BEAR WITH MY INFIRMITIES JANE TO OVERLOOK MY DEFICIENCIES
WHICH ARE NONE SIR TO ME
I LOVE YOU BETTER NOW WHEN I CAN REALLY BE
USEFUL TO YOU THAN I DID IN YOUR STATE OF PROUD INDEPENDENCE WHEN YOU
DISDAINED EVERY PART BUT THAT OF THE GIVER AND PROTECTOR
HITHERTO I HAVE HATED TO BE HELPED TO BE LED HENCEFORTH I FEEL I
SHALL HATE IT NO MORE
I DID NOT LIKE TO PUT MY HAND INTO A HIRELING'S
BUT IT IS PLEASANT TO FEEL IT CIRCLED BY JANE'S LITTLE FINGERS
I
PREFERRED UTTER LONELINESS TO THE CONSTANT ATTENDANCE OF SERVANTS BUT
JANE'S SOFT MINISTRY WILL BE A PERPETUAL JOY
JANE SUITS ME DO I SUIT
HER
TO THE FINEST FIBRE OF MY NATURE SIR
THE CASE BEING SO WE HAVE NOTHING IN THE WORLD TO WAIT FOR WE MUST BE
MARRIED INSTANTLY
HE LOOKED AND SPOKE WITH EAGERNESS HIS OLD IMPETUOSITY WAS RISING
WE MUST BECOME ONE FLESH WITHOUT ANY DELAY JANE THERE IS BUT THE
LICENCE TO GET THEN WE MARRY
MR
ROCHESTER I HAVE JUST DISCOVERED THE SUN IS FAR DECLINED FROM ITS
MERIDIAN AND PILOT IS ACTUALLY GONE HOME TO HIS DINNER
LET ME LOOK AT
YOUR WATCH
FASTEN IT INTO YOUR GIRDLE JANET AND KEEP IT HENCEFORWARD I HAVE NO
USE FOR IT
IT IS NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON SIR
DON'T YOU FEEL
HUNGRY
THE THIRD DAY FROM THIS MUST BE OUR WEDDING DAY JANE
NEVER MIND FINE
CLOTHES AND JEWELS NOW ALL THAT IS NOT WORTH A FILLIP
THE SUN HAS DRIED UP ALL THE RAIN DROPS SIR
THE BREEZE IS STILL IT
IS QUITE HOT
DO YOU KNOW JANE I HAVE YOUR LITTLE PEARL NECKLACE AT THIS MOMENT
FASTENED ROUND MY BRONZE SCRAG UNDER MY CRAVAT I HAVE WORN IT SINCE THE
DAY I LOST MY ONLY TREASURE AS A MEMENTO OF HER
WE WILL GO HOME THROUGH THE WOOD THAT WILL BE THE SHADIEST WAY
HE PURSUED HIS OWN THOUGHTS WITHOUT HEEDING ME
JANE YOU THINK ME I DARESAY AN IRRELIGIOUS DOG BUT MY HEART SWELLS
WITH GRATITUDE TO THE BENEFICENT GOD OF THIS EARTH JUST NOW
HE SEES NOT
AS MAN SEES BUT FAR CLEARER JUDGES NOT AS MAN JUDGES BUT FAR MORE
WISELY
I DID WRONG I WOULD HAVE SULLIED MY INNOCENT FLOWER BREATHED
GUILT ON ITS PURITY THE OMNIPOTENT SNATCHED IT FROM ME
I IN MY STIFF
NECKED REBELLION ALMOST CURSED THE DISPENSATION INSTEAD OF BENDING TO
THE DECREE I DEFIED IT
DIVINE JUSTICE PURSUED ITS COURSE DISASTERS
CAME THICK ON ME I WAS FORCED TO PASS THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW
OF DEATH
HIS CHASTISEMENTS ARE MIGHTY AND ONE SMOTE ME WHICH HAS
HUMBLED ME FOR EVER
YOU KNOW I WAS PROUD OF MY STRENGTH BUT WHAT IS IT
NOW WHEN I MUST GIVE IT OVER TO FOREIGN GUIDANCE AS A CHILD DOES ITS
WEAKNESS OF LATE JANE ONLY ONLY OF LATE I BEGAN TO SEE AND
ACKNOWLEDGE THE HAND OF GOD IN MY DOOM
I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE REMORSE
REPENTANCE THE WISH FOR RECONCILEMENT TO MY MAKER
I BEGAN SOMETIMES TO
PRAY VERY BRIEF PRAYERS THEY WERE BUT VERY SINCERE
SOME DAYS SINCE NAY I CAN NUMBER THEM FOUR IT WAS LAST MONDAY NIGHT
A SINGULAR MOOD CAME OVER ME ONE IN WHICH GRIEF REPLACED FRENZY SORROW
SULLENNESS
I HAD LONG HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT SINCE I COULD NOWHERE
FIND YOU YOU MUST BE DEAD
LATE THAT NIGHT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE BETWEEN
ELEVEN AND TWELVE O'CLOCK ERE I RETIRED TO MY DREARY REST I SUPPLICATED
GOD THAT IF IT SEEMED GOOD TO HIM I MIGHT SOON BE TAKEN FROM THIS
LIFE AND ADMITTED TO THAT WORLD TO COME WHERE THERE WAS STILL HOPE OF
REJOINING JANE
I WAS IN MY OWN ROOM AND SITTING BY THE WINDOW WHICH WAS OPEN IT
SOOTHED ME TO FEEL THE BALMY NIGHT AIR THOUGH I COULD SEE NO STARS AND
ONLY BY A VAGUE LUMINOUS HAZE KNEW THE PRESENCE OF A MOON
I LONGED
FOR THEE JANET OH I LONGED FOR THEE BOTH WITH SOUL AND FLESH I
ASKED OF GOD AT ONCE IN ANGUISH AND HUMILITY IF I HAD NOT BEEN LONG
ENOUGH DESOLATE AFFLICTED TORMENTED AND MIGHT NOT SOON TASTE BLISS AND
PEACE ONCE MORE
THAT I MERITED ALL I ENDURED I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT I
COULD SCARCELY ENDURE MORE I PLEADED AND THE ALPHA AND OMEGA OF MY
HEART'S WISHES BROKE INVOLUNTARILY FROM MY LIPS IN THE WORDS 'JANE
JANE JANE
DID YOU SPEAK THESE WORDS ALOUD
I DID JANE
IF ANY LISTENER HAD HEARD ME HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ME
MAD I PRONOUNCED THEM WITH SUCH FRANTIC ENERGY
AND IT WAS LAST MONDAY NIGHT SOMEWHERE NEAR MIDNIGHT
YES BUT THE TIME IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHAT FOLLOWED IS THE STRANGE
POINT
YOU WILL THINK ME SUPERSTITIOUS SOME SUPERSTITION I HAVE IN MY
BLOOD AND ALWAYS HAD NEVERTHELESS THIS IS TRUE TRUE AT LEAST IT IS
THAT I HEARD WHAT I NOW RELATE
AS I EXCLAIMED 'JANE JANE JANE A VOICE I CANNOT TELL WHENCE THE
VOICE CAME BUT I KNOW WHOSE VOICE IT WAS REPLIED 'I AM COMING WAIT
FOR ME AND A MOMENT AFTER WENT WHISPERING ON THE WIND THE WORDS 'WHERE
ARE YOU
I'LL TELL YOU IF I CAN THE IDEA THE PICTURE THESE WORDS OPENED TO MY
MIND YET IT IS DIFFICULT TO EXPRESS WHAT I WANT TO EXPRESS
FERNDEAN IS
BURIED AS YOU SEE IN A HEAVY WOOD WHERE SOUND FALLS DULL AND DIES
UNREVERBERATING
'WHERE ARE YOU SEEMED SPOKEN AMONGST MOUNTAINS FOR I
HEARD A HILL SENT ECHO REPEAT THE WORDS
COOLER AND FRESHER AT THE
MOMENT THE GALE SEEMED TO VISIT MY BROW I COULD HAVE DEEMED THAT IN SOME
WILD LONE SCENE I AND JANE WERE MEETING
IN SPIRIT I BELIEVE WE MUST
HAVE MET
YOU NO DOUBT WERE AT THAT HOUR IN UNCONSCIOUS SLEEP JANE
PERHAPS YOUR SOUL WANDERED FROM ITS CELL TO COMFORT MINE FOR THOSE WERE
YOUR ACCENTS AS CERTAIN AS I LIVE THEY WERE YOURS
READER IT WAS ON MONDAY NIGHT NEAR MIDNIGHT THAT I TOO HAD RECEIVED
THE MYSTERIOUS SUMMONS THOSE WERE THE VERY WORDS BY WHICH I REPLIED TO
IT
I LISTENED TO MR
ROCHESTER'S NARRATIVE BUT MADE NO DISCLOSURE IN
RETURN
THE COINCIDENCE STRUCK ME AS TOO AWFUL AND INEXPLICABLE TO BE
COMMUNICATED OR DISCUSSED
IF I TOLD ANYTHING MY TALE WOULD BE SUCH AS
MUST NECESSARILY MAKE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION ON THE MIND OF MY HEARER AND
THAT MIND YET FROM ITS SUFFERINGS TOO PRONE TO GLOOM NEEDED NOT THE
DEEPER SHADE OF THE SUPERNATURAL
I KEPT THESE THINGS THEN AND PONDERED
THEM IN MY HEART
YOU CANNOT NOW WONDER CONTINUED MY MASTER THAT WHEN YOU ROSE UPON ME
SO UNEXPECTEDLY LAST NIGHT I HAD DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING YOU ANY OTHER
THAN A MERE VOICE AND VISION SOMETHING THAT WOULD MELT TO SILENCE AND
ANNIHILATION AS THE MIDNIGHT WHISPER AND MOUNTAIN ECHO HAD MELTED
BEFORE
NOW I THANK GOD I KNOW IT TO BE OTHERWISE
YES I THANK
GOD
HE PUT ME OFF HIS KNEE ROSE AND REVERENTLY LIFTING HIS HAT FROM HIS
BROW AND BENDING HIS SIGHTLESS EYES TO THE EARTH HE STOOD IN MUTE
DEVOTION
ONLY THE LAST WORDS OF THE WORSHIP WERE AUDIBLE
I THANK MY MAKER THAT IN THE MIDST OF JUDGMENT HE HAS REMEMBERED
MERCY
I HUMBLY ENTREAT MY REDEEMER TO GIVE ME STRENGTH TO LEAD
HENCEFORTH A PURER LIFE THAN I HAVE DONE HITHERTO
THEN HE STRETCHED HIS HAND OUT TO BE LED
I TOOK THAT DEAR HAND HELD IT
A MOMENT TO MY LIPS THEN LET IT PASS ROUND MY SHOULDER BEING SO MUCH
LOWER OF STATURE THAN HE I SERVED BOTH FOR HIS PROP AND GUIDE
WE
ENTERED THE WOOD AND WENDED HOMEWARD
CHAPTER XXXVIII CONCLUSION
READER I MARRIED HIM
A QUIET WEDDING WE HAD HE AND I THE PARSON AND
CLERK WERE ALONE PRESENT
WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM CHURCH I WENT INTO THE
KITCHEN OF THE MANOR HOUSE WHERE MARY WAS COOKING THE DINNER AND JOHN
CLEANING THE KNIVES AND I SAID
MARY I HAVE BEEN MARRIED TO MR
ROCHESTER THIS MORNING THE
HOUSEKEEPER AND HER HUSBAND WERE BOTH OF THAT DECENT PHLEGMATIC ORDER OF
PEOPLE TO WHOM ONE MAY AT ANY TIME SAFELY COMMUNICATE A REMARKABLE PIECE
OF NEWS WITHOUT INCURRING THE DANGER OF HAVING ONE'S EARS PIERCED BY SOME
SHRILL EJACULATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY STUNNED BY A TORRENT OF WORDY
WONDERMENT
MARY DID LOOK UP AND SHE DID STARE AT ME THE LADLE WITH
WHICH SHE WAS BASTING A PAIR OF CHICKENS ROASTING AT THE FIRE DID FOR
SOME THREE MINUTES HANG SUSPENDED IN AIR AND FOR THE SAME SPACE OF TIME
JOHN'S KNIVES ALSO HAD REST FROM THE POLISHING PROCESS BUT MARY BENDING
AGAIN OVER THE ROAST SAID ONLY
HAVE YOU MISS WELL FOR SURE
A SHORT TIME AFTER SHE PURSUED I SEED YOU GO OUT WITH THE MASTER BUT I
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GONE TO CHURCH TO BE WED AND SHE BASTED AWAY
JOHN WHEN I TURNED TO HIM WAS GRINNING FROM EAR TO EAR
I TELLED MARY HOW IT WOULD BE HE SAID I KNEW WHAT MR
EDWARD JOHN
WAS AN OLD SERVANT AND HAD KNOWN HIS MASTER WHEN HE WAS THE CADET OF THE
HOUSE THEREFORE HE OFTEN GAVE HIM HIS CHRISTIAN NAME I KNEW WHAT MR
EDWARD WOULD DO AND I WAS CERTAIN HE WOULD NOT WAIT LONG NEITHER AND
HE'S DONE RIGHT FOR AUGHT I KNOW
I WISH YOU JOY MISS AND HE
POLITELY PULLED HIS FORELOCK
THANK YOU JOHN
MR
ROCHESTER TOLD ME TO GIVE YOU AND MARY THIS I
PUT INTO HIS HAND A FIVE POUND NOTE
WITHOUT WAITING TO HEAR MORE I
LEFT THE KITCHEN
IN PASSING THE DOOR OF THAT SANCTUM SOME TIME AFTER I
CAUGHT THE WORDS
SHE'LL HAPPEN DO BETTER FOR HIM NOR ONY O'T' GRAND LADIES AND AGAIN
IF SHE BEN'T ONE O' TH' HANDSOMEST SHE'S NOAN FAAL AND VARRY
GOOD NATURED AND I' HIS EEN SHE'S FAIR BEAUTIFUL ONYBODY MAY SEE THAT
I WROTE TO MOOR HOUSE AND TO CAMBRIDGE IMMEDIATELY TO SAY WHAT I HAD
DONE FULLY EXPLAINING ALSO WHY I HAD THUS ACTED
DIANA AND MARY
APPROVED THE STEP UNRESERVEDLY
DIANA ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD JUST GIVE
ME TIME TO GET OVER THE HONEYMOON AND THEN SHE WOULD COME AND SEE ME
SHE HAD BETTER NOT WAIT TILL THEN JANE SAID MR
ROCHESTER WHEN I
READ HER LETTER TO HIM IF SHE DOES SHE WILL BE TOO LATE FOR OUR
HONEYMOON WILL SHINE OUR LIFE LONG ITS BEAMS WILL ONLY FADE OVER YOUR
GRAVE OR MINE
HOW ST
JOHN RECEIVED THE NEWS I DON'T KNOW HE NEVER ANSWERED THE
LETTER IN WHICH I COMMUNICATED IT YET SIX MONTHS AFTER HE WROTE TO ME
WITHOUT HOWEVER MENTIONING MR
ROCHESTER'S NAME OR ALLUDING TO MY
MARRIAGE
HIS LETTER WAS THEN CALM AND THOUGH VERY SERIOUS KIND
HE
HAS MAINTAINED A REGULAR THOUGH NOT FREQUENT CORRESPONDENCE EVER SINCE
HE HOPES I AM HAPPY AND TRUSTS I AM NOT OF THOSE WHO LIVE WITHOUT GOD IN
THE WORLD AND ONLY MIND EARTHLY THINGS
YOU HAVE NOT QUITE FORGOTTEN LITTLE ADELE HAVE YOU READER I HAD NOT
I SOON ASKED AND OBTAINED LEAVE OF MR
ROCHESTER TO GO AND SEE HER AT
THE SCHOOL WHERE HE HAD PLACED HER
HER FRANTIC JOY AT BEHOLDING ME
AGAIN MOVED ME MUCH
SHE LOOKED PALE AND THIN SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT
HAPPY
I FOUND THE RULES OF THE ESTABLISHMENT WERE TOO STRICT ITS
COURSE OF STUDY TOO SEVERE FOR A CHILD OF HER AGE I TOOK HER HOME WITH
ME
I MEANT TO BECOME HER GOVERNESS ONCE MORE BUT I SOON FOUND THIS
IMPRACTICABLE MY TIME AND CARES WERE NOW REQUIRED BY ANOTHER MY HUSBAND
NEEDED THEM ALL
SO I SOUGHT OUT A SCHOOL CONDUCTED ON A MORE INDULGENT
SYSTEM AND NEAR ENOUGH TO PERMIT OF MY VISITING HER OFTEN AND BRINGING
HER HOME SOMETIMES
I TOOK CARE SHE SHOULD NEVER WANT FOR ANYTHING THAT
COULD CONTRIBUTE TO HER COMFORT SHE SOON SETTLED IN HER NEW ABODE
BECAME VERY HAPPY THERE AND MADE FAIR PROGRESS IN HER STUDIES
AS SHE
GREW UP A SOUND ENGLISH EDUCATION CORRECTED IN A GREAT MEASURE HER
FRENCH DEFECTS AND WHEN SHE LEFT SCHOOL I FOUND IN HER A PLEASING AND
OBLIGING COMPANION DOCILE GOOD TEMPERED AND WELL PRINCIPLED
BY HER
GRATEFUL ATTENTION TO ME AND MINE SHE HAS LONG SINCE WELL REPAID ANY
LITTLE KINDNESS I EVER HAD IT IN MY POWER TO OFFER HER
MY TALE DRAWS TO ITS CLOSE ONE WORD RESPECTING MY EXPERIENCE OF MARRIED
LIFE AND ONE BRIEF GLANCE AT THE FORTUNES OF THOSE WHOSE NAMES HAVE MOST
FREQUENTLY RECURRED IN THIS NARRATIVE AND I HAVE DONE
I HAVE NOW BEEN MARRIED TEN YEARS
I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO LIVE ENTIRELY
FOR AND WITH WHAT I LOVE BEST ON EARTH
I HOLD MYSELF SUPREMELY
BLEST BLEST BEYOND WHAT LANGUAGE CAN EXPRESS BECAUSE I AM MY HUSBAND'S
LIFE AS FULLY AS HE IS MINE
NO WOMAN WAS EVER NEARER TO HER MATE THAN I
AM EVER MORE ABSOLUTELY BONE OF HIS BONE AND FLESH OF HIS FLESH
I KNOW
NO WEARINESS OF MY EDWARD'S SOCIETY HE KNOWS NONE OF MINE ANY MORE THAN
WE EACH DO OF THE PULSATION OF THE HEART THAT BEATS IN OUR SEPARATE
BOSOMS CONSEQUENTLY WE ARE EVER TOGETHER
TO BE TOGETHER IS FOR US TO
BE AT ONCE AS FREE AS IN SOLITUDE AS GAY AS IN COMPANY
WE TALK I
BELIEVE ALL DAY LONG TO TALK TO EACH OTHER IS BUT A MORE ANIMATED AND
AN AUDIBLE THINKING
ALL MY CONFIDENCE IS BESTOWED ON HIM ALL HIS
CONFIDENCE IS DEVOTED TO ME WE ARE PRECISELY SUITED IN CHARACTER PERFECT
CONCORD IS THE RESULT
MR
ROCHESTER CONTINUED BLIND THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF OUR UNION PERHAPS
IT WAS THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THAT DREW US SO VERY NEAR THAT KNIT US SO VERY
CLOSE FOR I WAS THEN HIS VISION AS I AM STILL HIS RIGHT HAND
LITERALLY I WAS WHAT HE OFTEN CALLED ME THE APPLE OF HIS EYE
HE SAW
NATURE HE SAW BOOKS THROUGH ME AND NEVER DID I WEARY OF GAZING FOR HIS
BEHALF AND OF PUTTING INTO WORDS THE EFFECT OF FIELD TREE TOWN RIVER
CLOUD SUNBEAM OF THE LANDSCAPE BEFORE US OF THE WEATHER ROUND US AND
IMPRESSING BY SOUND ON HIS EAR WHAT LIGHT COULD NO LONGER STAMP ON HIS
EYE
NEVER DID I WEARY OF READING TO HIM NEVER DID I WEARY OF
CONDUCTING HIM WHERE HE WISHED TO GO OF DOING FOR HIM WHAT HE WISHED TO
BE DONE
AND THERE WAS A PLEASURE IN MY SERVICES MOST FULL MOST
EXQUISITE EVEN THOUGH SAD BECAUSE HE CLAIMED THESE SERVICES WITHOUT
PAINFUL SHAME OR DAMPING HUMILIATION
HE LOVED ME SO TRULY THAT HE KNEW
NO RELUCTANCE IN PROFITING BY MY ATTENDANCE HE FELT I LOVED HIM SO
FONDLY THAT TO YIELD THAT ATTENDANCE WAS TO INDULGE MY SWEETEST WISHES
ONE MORNING AT THE END OF THE TWO YEARS AS I WAS WRITING A LETTER TO HIS
DICTATION HE CAME AND BENT OVER ME AND SAID JANE HAVE YOU A
GLITTERING ORNAMENT ROUND YOUR NECK
I HAD A GOLD WATCH CHAIN I ANSWERED YES
AND HAVE YOU A PALE BLUE DRESS ON
AND HAVE YOU A PALE BLUE DRESS ON P435 JPG
I HAD
HE INFORMED ME THEN THAT FOR SOME TIME HE HAD FANCIED THE
OBSCURITY CLOUDING ONE EYE WAS BECOMING LESS DENSE AND THAT NOW HE WAS
SURE OF IT
HE AND I WENT UP TO LONDON
HE HAD THE ADVICE OF AN EMINENT OCULIST AND
HE EVENTUALLY RECOVERED THE SIGHT OF THAT ONE EYE
HE CANNOT NOW SEE
VERY DISTINCTLY HE CANNOT READ OR WRITE MUCH BUT HE CAN FIND HIS WAY
WITHOUT BEING LED BY THE HAND THE SKY IS NO LONGER A BLANK TO HIM THE
EARTH NO LONGER A VOID
WHEN HIS FIRST BORN WAS PUT INTO HIS ARMS HE
COULD SEE THAT THE BOY HAD INHERITED HIS OWN EYES AS THEY ONCE
WERE LARGE BRILLIANT AND BLACK
ON THAT OCCASION HE AGAIN WITH A
FULL HEART ACKNOWLEDGED THAT GOD HAD TEMPERED JUDGMENT WITH MERCY
MY EDWARD AND I THEN ARE HAPPY AND THE MORE SO BECAUSE THOSE WE MOST
LOVE ARE HAPPY LIKEWISE
DIANA AND MARY RIVERS ARE BOTH MARRIED
ALTERNATELY ONCE EVERY YEAR THEY COME TO SEE US AND WE GO TO SEE THEM
DIANA'S HUSBAND IS A CAPTAIN IN THE NAVY A GALLANT OFFICER AND A GOOD
MAN
MARY'S IS A CLERGYMAN A COLLEGE FRIEND OF HER BROTHER'S AND FROM
HIS ATTAINMENTS AND PRINCIPLES WORTHY OF THE CONNECTION
BOTH CAPTAIN
FITZJAMES AND MR
WHARTON LOVE THEIR WIVES AND ARE LOVED BY THEM
AS TO ST
JOHN RIVERS HE LEFT ENGLAND HE WENT TO INDIA
HE ENTERED ON
THE PATH HE HAD MARKED FOR HIMSELF HE PURSUES IT STILL
A MORE
RESOLUTE INDEFATIGABLE PIONEER NEVER WROUGHT AMIDST ROCKS AND DANGERS
FIRM FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED FULL OF ENERGY AND ZEAL AND TRUTH HE
LABOURS FOR HIS RACE HE CLEARS THEIR PAINFUL WAY TO IMPROVEMENT HE HEWS
DOWN LIKE A GIANT THE PREJUDICES OF CREED AND CASTE THAT ENCUMBER IT
HE
MAY BE STERN HE MAY BE EXACTING HE MAY BE AMBITIOUS YET BUT HIS IS THE
STERNNESS OF THE WARRIOR GREATHEART WHO GUARDS HIS PILGRIM CONVOY FROM
THE ONSLAUGHT OF APOLLYON
HIS IS THE EXACTION OF THE APOSTLE WHO
SPEAKS BUT FOR CHRIST WHEN HE SAYS WHOSOEVER WILL COME AFTER ME LET
HIM DENY HIMSELF AND TAKE UP HIS CROSS AND FOLLOW ME HIS IS THE
AMBITION OF THE HIGH MASTER SPIRIT WHICH AIMS TO FILL A PLACE IN THE
FIRST RANK OF THOSE WHO ARE REDEEMED FROM THE EARTH WHO STAND WITHOUT
FAULT BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD WHO SHARE THE LAST MIGHTY VICTORIES OF
THE LAMB WHO ARE CALLED AND CHOSEN AND FAITHFUL
ST
JOHN IS UNMARRIED HE NEVER WILL MARRY NOW
HIMSELF HAS HITHERTO
SUFFICED TO THE TOIL AND THE TOIL DRAWS NEAR ITS CLOSE HIS GLORIOUS SUN
HASTENS TO ITS SETTING
THE LAST LETTER I RECEIVED FROM HIM DREW FROM MY
EYES HUMAN TEARS AND YET FILLED MY HEART WITH DIVINE JOY HE ANTICIPATED
HIS SURE REWARD HIS INCORRUPTIBLE CROWN
I KNOW THAT A STRANGER'S HAND
WILL WRITE TO ME NEXT TO SAY THAT THE GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT HAS BEEN
CALLED AT LENGTH INTO THE JOY OF HIS LORD
AND WHY WEEP FOR THIS NO
FEAR OF DEATH WILL DARKEN ST
JOHN'S LAST HOUR HIS MIND WILL BE
UNCLOUDED HIS HEART WILL BE UNDAUNTED HIS HOPE WILL BE SURE HIS FAITH
STEADFAST
HIS OWN WORDS ARE A PLEDGE OF THIS
MY MASTER HE SAYS HAS FOREWARNED ME
DAILY HE ANNOUNCES MORE
DISTINCTLY 'SURELY I COME QUICKLY AND HOURLY I MORE EAGERLY
RESPOND 'AMEN EVEN SO COME LORD JESUS

CHAPTER I
BRETTON
MY GODMOTHER LIVED IN A HANDSOME HOUSE IN THE CLEAN AND ANCIENT TOWN OF
BRETTON
HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY HAD BEEN RESIDENTS THERE FOR GENERATIONS
AND BORE INDEED THE NAME OF THEIR BIRTHPLACE BRETTON OF BRETTON
WHETHER BY COINCIDENCE OR BECAUSE SOME REMOTE ANCESTOR HAD BEEN A
PERSONAGE OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO LEAVE HIS NAME TO HIS
NEIGHBOURHOOD I KNOW NOT
WHEN I WAS A GIRL I WENT TO BRETTON ABOUT TWICE A YEAR AND WELL I
LIKED THE VISIT
THE HOUSE AND ITS INMATES SPECIALLY SUITED ME
THE
LARGE PEACEFUL ROOMS THE WELL ARRANGED FURNITURE THE CLEAR WIDE
WINDOWS THE BALCONY OUTSIDE LOOKING DOWN ON A FINE ANTIQUE STREET
WHERE SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS SEEMED ALWAYS TO ABIDE SO QUIET WAS ITS
ATMOSPHERE SO CLEAN ITS PAVEMENT THESE THINGS PLEASED ME WELL
ONE CHILD IN A HOUSEHOLD OF GROWN PEOPLE IS USUALLY MADE VERY MUCH OF
AND IN A QUIET WAY I WAS A GOOD DEAL TAKEN NOTICE OF BY MRS
BRETTON
WHO HAD BEEN LEFT A WIDOW WITH ONE SON BEFORE I KNEW HER HER
HUSBAND A PHYSICIAN HAVING DIED WHILE SHE WAS YET A YOUNG AND
HANDSOME WOMAN
SHE WAS NOT YOUNG AS I REMEMBER HER BUT SHE WAS STILL HANDSOME TALL
WELL MADE AND THOUGH DARK FOR AN ENGLISHWOMAN YET WEARING ALWAYS THE
CLEARNESS OF HEALTH IN HER BRUNETTE CHEEK AND ITS VIVACITY IN A PAIR
OF FINE CHEERFUL BLACK EYES
PEOPLE ESTEEMED IT A GRIEVOUS PITY THAT
SHE HAD NOT CONFERRED HER COMPLEXION ON HER SON WHOSE EYES WERE
BLUE THOUGH EVEN IN BOYHOOD VERY PIERCING AND THE COLOUR OF HIS
LONG HAIR SUCH AS FRIENDS DID NOT VENTURE TO SPECIFY EXCEPT AS THE SUN
SHONE ON IT WHEN THEY CALLED IT GOLDEN
HE INHERITED THE LINES OF HIS
MOTHER'S FEATURES HOWEVER ALSO HER GOOD TEETH HER STATURE OR THE
PROMISE OF HER STATURE FOR HE WAS NOT YET FULL GROWN AND WHAT WAS
BETTER HER HEALTH WITHOUT FLAW AND HER SPIRITS OF THAT TONE AND
EQUALITY WHICH ARE BETTER THAN A FORTUNE TO THE POSSESSOR
IN THE AUTUMN OF THE YEAR I WAS STAYING AT BRETTON MY GODMOTHER
HAVING COME IN PERSON TO CLAIM ME OF THE KINSFOLK WITH WHOM WAS AT THAT
TIME FIXED MY PERMANENT RESIDENCE
I BELIEVE SHE THEN PLAINLY SAW
EVENTS COMING WHOSE VERY SHADOW I SCARCE GUESSED YET OF WHICH THE
FAINT SUSPICION SUFFICED TO IMPART UNSETTLED SADNESS AND MADE ME GLAD
TO CHANGE SCENE AND SOCIETY
TIME ALWAYS FLOWED SMOOTHLY FOR ME AT MY GODMOTHER'S SIDE NOT WITH
TUMULTUOUS SWIFTNESS BUT BLANDLY LIKE THE GLIDING OF A FULL RIVER
THROUGH A PLAIN
MY VISITS TO HER RESEMBLED THE SOJOURN OF CHRISTIAN
AND HOPEFUL BESIDE A CERTAIN PLEASANT STREAM WITH GREEN TREES ON EACH
BANK AND MEADOWS BEAUTIFIED WITH LILIES ALL THE YEAR ROUND THE CHARM
OF VARIETY THERE WAS NOT NOR THE EXCITEMENT OF INCIDENT BUT I LIKED
PEACE SO WELL AND SOUGHT STIMULUS SO LITTLE THAT WHEN THE LATTER CAME
I ALMOST FELT IT A DISTURBANCE AND WISHED RATHER IT HAD STILL HELD
ALOOF
ONE DAY A LETTER WAS RECEIVED OF WHICH THE CONTENTS EVIDENTLY CAUSED
MRS
BRETTON SURPRISE AND SOME CONCERN
I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS FROM
HOME AND TREMBLED EXPECTING I KNOW NOT WHAT DISASTROUS COMMUNICATION
TO ME HOWEVER NO REFERENCE WAS MADE AND THE CLOUD SEEMED TO PASS
THE NEXT DAY ON MY RETURN FROM A LONG WALK I FOUND AS I ENTERED MY
BEDROOM AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE
IN ADDITION TO MY OWN FRENCH BED IN ITS
SHADY RECESS APPEARED IN A CORNER A SMALL CRIB DRAPED WITH WHITE AND
IN ADDITION TO MY MAHOGANY CHEST OF DRAWERS I SAW A TINY ROSEWOOD
CHEST
I STOOD STILL GAZED AND CONSIDERED
OF WHAT ARE THESE THINGS THE SIGNS AND TOKENS I ASKED
THE ANSWER
WAS OBVIOUS
A SECOND GUEST IS COMING MRS
BRETTON EXPECTS OTHER
VISITORS
ON DESCENDING TO DINNER EXPLANATIONS ENSUED
A LITTLE GIRL I WAS
TOLD WOULD SHORTLY BE MY COMPANION THE DAUGHTER OF A FRIEND AND
DISTANT RELATION OF THE LATE DR
BRETTON'S
THIS LITTLE GIRL IT WAS
ADDED HAD RECENTLY LOST HER MOTHER THOUGH INDEED MRS
BRETTON ERE
LONG SUBJOINED THE LOSS WAS NOT SO GREAT AS MIGHT AT FIRST APPEAR
MRS
HOME HOME IT SEEMS WAS THE NAME HAD BEEN A VERY PRETTY BUT A
GIDDY CARELESS WOMAN WHO HAD NEGLECTED HER CHILD AND DISAPPOINTED
AND DISHEARTENED HER HUSBAND
SO FAR FROM CONGENIAL HAD THE UNION
PROVED THAT SEPARATION AT LAST ENSUED SEPARATION BY MUTUAL CONSENT
NOT AFTER ANY LEGAL PROCESS
SOON AFTER THIS EVENT THE LADY HAVING
OVER EXERTED HERSELF AT A BALL CAUGHT COLD TOOK A FEVER AND DIED
AFTER A VERY BRIEF ILLNESS
HER HUSBAND NATURALLY A MAN OF VERY
SENSITIVE FEELINGS AND SHOCKED INEXPRESSIBLY BY TOO SUDDEN
COMMUNICATION OF THE NEWS COULD HARDLY IT SEEMS NOW BE PERSUADED BUT
THAT SOME OVER SEVERITY ON HIS PART SOME DEFICIENCY IN PATIENCE AND
INDULGENCE HAD CONTRIBUTED TO HASTEN HER END
HE HAD BROODED OVER THIS
IDEA TILL HIS SPIRITS WERE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED THE MEDICAL MEN INSISTED
ON TRAVELLING BEING TRIED AS A REMEDY AND MEANWHILE MRS
BRETTON HAD
OFFERED TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIS LITTLE GIRL
AND I HOPE ADDED MY
GODMOTHER IN CONCLUSION THE CHILD WILL NOT BE LIKE HER MAMMA AS
SILLY AND FRIVOLOUS A LITTLE FLIRT AS EVER SENSIBLE MAN WAS WEAK ENOUGH
TO MARRY
FOR SAID SHE MR
HOME IS A SENSIBLE MAN IN HIS WAY
THOUGH NOT VERY PRACTICAL HE IS FOND OF SCIENCE AND LIVES HALF HIS
LIFE IN A LABORATORY TRYING EXPERIMENTS A THING HIS BUTTERFLY WIFE
COULD NEITHER COMPREHEND NOR ENDURE AND INDEED CONFESSED MY
GODMOTHER I SHOULD NOT HAVE LIKED IT MYSELF
IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION OF MINE SHE FURTHER INFORMED ME THAT HER LATE
HUSBAND USED TO SAY MR
HOME HAD DERIVED THIS SCIENTIFIC TURN FROM A
MATERNAL UNCLE A FRENCH SAVANT FOR HE CAME IT SEEMS OF MIXED FRENCH
AND SCOTTISH ORIGIN AND HAD CONNECTIONS NOW LIVING IN FRANCE OF WHOM
MORE THAN ONE WROTE DE BEFORE HIS NAME AND CALLED HIMSELF NOBLE
THAT SAME EVENING AT NINE O'CLOCK A SERVANT WAS DESPATCHED TO MEET THE
COACH BY WHICH OUR LITTLE VISITOR WAS EXPECTED
MRS
BRETTON AND I SAT
ALONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM WAITING HER COMING JOHN GRAHAM BRETTON BEING
ABSENT ON A VISIT TO ONE OF HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTRY
MY GODMOTHER READ THE EVENING PAPER WHILE SHE WAITED I SEWED
IT WAS A
WET NIGHT THE RAIN LASHED THE PANES AND THE WIND SOUNDED ANGRY AND
RESTLESS
POOR CHILD SAID MRS
BRETTON FROM TIME TO TIME
WHAT WEATHER FOR
HER JOURNEY I WISH SHE WERE SAFE HERE
A LITTLE BEFORE TEN THE DOOR BELL ANNOUNCED WARREN'S RETURN
NO SOONER
WAS THE DOOR OPENED THAN I RAN DOWN INTO THE HALL THERE LAY A TRUNK
AND SOME BAND BOXES BESIDE THEM STOOD A PERSON LIKE A NURSE GIRL AND
AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE WAS WARREN WITH A SHAWLED BUNDLE IN HIS
ARMS
IS THAT THE CHILD I ASKED
YES MISS
I WOULD HAVE OPENED THE SHAWL AND TRIED TO GET A PEEP AT THE FACE BUT
IT WAS HASTILY TURNED FROM ME TO WARREN'S SHOULDER
PUT ME DOWN PLEASE SAID A SMALL VOICE WHEN WARREN OPENED THE
DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND TAKE OFF THIS SHAWL CONTINUED THE SPEAKER
EXTRACTING WITH ITS MINUTE HAND THE PIN AND WITH A SORT OF FASTIDIOUS
HASTE DOFFING THE CLUMSY WRAPPING
THE CREATURE WHICH NOW APPEARED MADE
A DEFT ATTEMPT TO FOLD THE SHAWL BUT THE DRAPERY WAS MUCH TOO HEAVY
AND LARGE TO BE SUSTAINED OR WIELDED BY THOSE HANDS AND ARMS
GIVE IT
TO HARRIET PLEASE WAS THEN THE DIRECTION AND SHE CAN PUT IT AWAY
THIS SAID IT TURNED AND FIXED ITS EYES ON MRS
BRETTON
COME HERE LITTLE DEAR SAID THAT LADY
COME AND LET ME SEE IF YOU
ARE COLD AND DAMP COME AND LET ME WARM YOU AT THE FIRE
THE CHILD ADVANCED PROMPTLY
RELIEVED OF HER WRAPPING SHE APPEARED
EXCEEDINGLY TINY BUT WAS A NEAT COMPLETELY FASHIONED LITTLE FIGURE
LIGHT SLIGHT AND STRAIGHT
SEATED ON MY GODMOTHER'S AMPLE LAP SHE
LOOKED A MERE DOLL HER NECK DELICATE AS WAX HER HEAD OF SILKY CURLS
INCREASED I THOUGHT THE RESEMBLANCE
MRS
BRETTON TALKED IN LITTLE FOND PHRASES AS SHE CHAFED THE CHILD'S
HANDS ARMS AND FEET FIRST SHE WAS CONSIDERED WITH A WISTFUL GAZE
BUT SOON A SMILE ANSWERED HER
MRS
BRETTON WAS NOT GENERALLY A
CARESSING WOMAN EVEN WITH HER DEEPLY CHERISHED SON HER MANNER WAS
RARELY SENTIMENTAL OFTEN THE REVERSE BUT WHEN THE SMALL STRANGER
SMILED AT HER SHE KISSED IT ASKING WHAT IS MY LITTLE ONE'S NAME
MISSY
BUT BESIDES MISSY
POLLY PAPA CALLS HER
WILL POLLY BE CONTENT TO LIVE WITH ME
NOT ALWAYS BUT TILL PAPA COMES HOME
PAPA IS GONE AWAY SHE SHOOK
HER HEAD EXPRESSIVELY
HE WILL RETURN TO POLLY OR SEND FOR HER
WILL HE MA'AM DO YOU KNOW HE WILL
I THINK SO
BUT HARRIET THINKS NOT AT LEAST NOT FOR A LONG WHILE
HE IS ILL
HER EYES FILLED
SHE DREW HER HAND FROM MRS
BRETTON'S AND MADE A
MOVEMENT TO LEAVE HER LAP IT WAS AT FIRST RESISTED BUT SHE
SAID PLEASE I WISH TO GO I CAN SIT ON A STOOL
SHE WAS ALLOWED TO SLIP DOWN FROM THE KNEE AND TAKING A FOOTSTOOL SHE
CARRIED IT TO A CORNER WHERE THE SHADE WAS DEEP AND THERE SEATED
HERSELF
MRS
BRETTON THOUGH A COMMANDING AND IN GRAVE MATTERS EVEN A
PEREMPTORY WOMAN WAS OFTEN PASSIVE IN TRIFLES SHE ALLOWED THE CHILD
HER WAY
SHE SAID TO ME TAKE NO NOTICE AT PRESENT BUT I DID TAKE
NOTICE I WATCHED POLLY REST HER SMALL ELBOW ON HER SMALL KNEE HER
HEAD ON HER HAND I OBSERVED HER DRAW A SQUARE INCH OR TWO OF
POCKET HANDKERCHIEF FROM THE DOLL POCKET OF HER DOLL SKIRT AND THEN I
HEARD HER WEEP
OTHER CHILDREN IN GRIEF OR PAIN CRY ALOUD WITHOUT
SHAME OR RESTRAINT BUT THIS BEING WEPT THE TINIEST OCCASIONAL SNIFF
TESTIFIED TO HER EMOTION
MRS
BRETTON DID NOT HEAR IT WHICH WAS QUITE
AS WELL
ERE LONG A VOICE ISSUING FROM THE CORNER DEMANDED MAY THE
BELL BE RUNG FOR HARRIET
I RANG THE NURSE WAS SUMMONED AND CAME
HARRIET I MUST BE PUT TO BED SAID HER LITTLE MISTRESS
YOU MUST
ASK WHERE MY BED IS
HARRIET SIGNIFIED THAT SHE HAD ALREADY MADE THAT INQUIRY
ASK IF YOU SLEEP WITH ME HARRIET
NO MISSY SAID THE NURSE YOU ARE TO SHARE THIS YOUNG LADY'S ROOM
DESIGNATING ME
MISSY DID NOT LEAVE HER SEAT BUT I SAW HER EYES SEEK ME
AFTER SOME
MINUTES' SILENT SCRUTINY SHE EMERGED FROM HER CORNER
I WISH YOU MA'AM GOOD NIGHT SAID SHE TO MRS
BRETTON BUT SHE
PASSED ME MUTE
GOOD NIGHT POLLY I SAID
NO NEED TO SAY GOOD NIGHT SINCE WE SLEEP IN THE SAME CHAMBER WAS
THE REPLY WITH WHICH SHE VANISHED FROM THE DRAWING ROOM
WE HEARD
HARRIET PROPOSE TO CARRY HER UP STAIRS
NO NEED WAS AGAIN HER
ANSWER NO NEED NO NEED AND HER SMALL STEP TOILED WEARILY UP THE
STAIRCASE
ON GOING TO BED AN HOUR AFTERWARDS I FOUND HER STILL WIDE AWAKE
SHE
HAD ARRANGED HER PILLOWS SO AS TO SUPPORT HER LITTLE PERSON IN A
SITTING POSTURE HER HANDS PLACED ONE WITHIN THE OTHER RESTED QUIETLY
ON THE SHEET WITH AN OLD FASHIONED CALM MOST UNCHILDLIKE
I ABSTAINED
FROM SPEAKING TO HER FOR SOME TIME BUT JUST BEFORE EXTINGUISHING THE
LIGHT I RECOMMENDED HER TO LIE DOWN
BY AND BY WAS THE ANSWER
BUT YOU WILL TAKE COLD MISSY
SHE TOOK SOME TINY ARTICLE OF RAIMENT FROM THE CHAIR AT HER CRIB SIDE
AND WITH IT COVERED HER SHOULDERS
I SUFFERED HER TO DO AS SHE PLEASED
LISTENING AWHILE IN THE DARKNESS I WAS AWARE THAT SHE STILL
WEPT WEPT UNDER RESTRAINT QUIETLY AND CAUTIOUSLY
ON AWAKING WITH DAYLIGHT A TRICKLING OF WATER CAUGHT MY EAR
BEHOLD
THERE SHE WAS RISEN AND MOUNTED ON A STOOL NEAR THE WASHSTAND WITH
PAINS AND DIFFICULTY INCLINING THE EWER WHICH SHE COULD NOT LIFT SO
AS TO POUR ITS CONTENTS INTO THE BASIN
IT WAS CURIOUS TO WATCH HER AS
SHE WASHED AND DRESSED SO SMALL BUSY AND NOISELESS
EVIDENTLY SHE
WAS LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO PERFORM HER OWN TOILET AND THE BUTTONS
STRINGS HOOKS AND EYES OFFERED DIFFICULTIES WHICH SHE ENCOUNTERED
WITH A PERSEVERANCE GOOD TO WITNESS
SHE FOLDED HER NIGHT DRESS SHE
SMOOTHED THE DRAPERY OF HER COUCH QUITE NEATLY WITHDRAWING INTO A
CORNER WHERE THE SWEEP OF THE WHITE CURTAIN CONCEALED HER SHE BECAME
STILL
I HALF ROSE AND ADVANCED MY HEAD TO SEE HOW SHE WAS OCCUPIED
ON HER KNEES WITH HER FOREHEAD BENT ON HER HANDS I PERCEIVED THAT SHE
WAS PRAYING
HER NURSE TAPPED AT THE DOOR
SHE STARTED UP
I AM DRESSED HARRIET SAID SHE I HAVE DRESSED MYSELF BUT I DO NOT
FEEL NEAT
MAKE ME NEAT
WHY DID YOU DRESS YOURSELF MISSY
HUSH SPEAK LOW HARRIET FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE GIRL MEANING ME
WHO NOW LAY WITH MY EYES SHUT
I DRESSED MYSELF TO LEARN AGAINST THE
TIME YOU LEAVE ME
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO
WHEN YOU ARE CROSS I HAVE MANY A TIME WANTED YOU TO GO BUT NOT NOW
TIE MY SASH STRAIGHT MAKE MY HAIR SMOOTH PLEASE
YOUR SASH IS STRAIGHT ENOUGH
WHAT A PARTICULAR LITTLE BODY YOU ARE
IT MUST BE TIED AGAIN
PLEASE TO TIE IT
THERE THEN
WHEN I AM GONE YOU MUST GET THAT YOUNG LADY TO DRESS YOU
ON NO ACCOUNT
WHY SHE IS A VERY NICE YOUNG LADY
I HOPE YOU MEAN TO BEHAVE PRETTILY
TO HER MISSY AND NOT SHOW YOUR AIRS
SHE SHALL DRESS ME ON NO ACCOUNT
COMICAL LITTLE THING
YOU ARE NOT PASSING THE COMB STRAIGHT THROUGH MY HAIR HARRIET THE
LINE WILL BE CROOKED
AY YOU ARE ILL TO PLEASE
DOES THAT SUIT
PRETTY WELL
WHERE SHOULD I GO NOW THAT I AM DRESSED
I WILL TAKE YOU INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM
COME THEN
THEY PROCEEDED TO THE DOOR
SHE STOPPED
OH HARRIET I WISH THIS WAS PAPA'S HOUSE I DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE
BE A GOOD CHILD MISSY
I AM GOOD BUT I ACHE HERE PUTTING HER HAND TO HER HEART AND
MOANING WHILE SHE REITERATED PAPA PAPA
I ROUSED MYSELF AND STARTED UP TO CHECK THIS SCENE WHILE IT WAS YET
WITHIN BOUNDS
SAY GOOD MORNING TO THE YOUNG LADY DICTATED HARRIET
SHE SAID
GOOD MORNING AND THEN FOLLOWED HER NURSE FROM THE ROOM
HARRIET
TEMPORARILY LEFT THAT SAME DAY TO GO TO HER OWN FRIENDS WHO LIVED IN
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
ON DESCENDING I FOUND PAULINA THE CHILD CALLED HERSELF POLLY BUT HER
FULL NAME WAS PAULINA MARY SEATED AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE BY MRS
BRETTON'S SIDE A MUG OF MILK STOOD BEFORE HER A MORSEL OF BREAD
FILLED HER HAND WHICH LAY PASSIVE ON THE TABLE CLOTH SHE WAS NOT
EATING
HOW WE SHALL CONCILIATE THIS LITTLE CREATURE SAID MRS
BRETTON TO
ME I DON'T KNOW SHE TASTES NOTHING AND BY HER LOOKS SHE HAS NOT
SLEPT
I EXPRESSED MY CONFIDENCE IN THE EFFECTS OF TIME AND KINDNESS
IF SHE WERE TO TAKE A FANCY TO ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE SHE WOULD SOON
SETTLE BUT NOT TILL THEN REPLIED MRS
BRETTON
CHAPTER II
PAULINA
SOME DAYS ELAPSED AND IT APPEARED SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO TAKE MUCH OF A
FANCY TO ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE
SHE WAS NOT EXACTLY NAUGHTY OR WILFUL
SHE WAS FAR FROM DISOBEDIENT BUT AN OBJECT LESS CONDUCIVE TO
COMFORT TO TRANQUILLITY EVEN THAN SHE PRESENTED IT WAS SCARCELY
POSSIBLE TO HAVE BEFORE ONE'S EYES
SHE MOPED NO GROWN PERSON COULD
HAVE PERFORMED THAT UNCHEERING BUSINESS BETTER NO FURROWED FACE OF
ADULT EXILE LONGING FOR EUROPE AT EUROPE'S ANTIPODES EVER BORE MORE
LEGIBLY THE SIGNS OF HOME SICKNESS THAN DID HER INFANT VISAGE
SHE
SEEMED GROWING OLD AND UNEARTHLY
I LUCY SNOWE PLEAD GUILTLESS OF
THAT CURSE AN OVERHEATED AND DISCURSIVE IMAGINATION BUT WHENEVER
OPENING A ROOM DOOR I FOUND HER SEATED IN A CORNER ALONE HER HEAD IN
HER PIGMY HAND THAT ROOM SEEMED TO ME NOT INHABITED BUT HAUNTED
AND AGAIN WHEN OF MOONLIGHT NIGHTS ON WAKING I BEHELD HER FIGURE
WHITE AND CONSPICUOUS IN ITS NIGHT DRESS KNEELING UPRIGHT IN BED AND
PRAYING LIKE SOME CATHOLIC OR METHODIST ENTHUSIAST SOME PRECOCIOUS
FANATIC OR UNTIMELY SAINT I SCARCELY KNOW WHAT THOUGHTS I HAD BUT
THEY RAN RISK OF BEING HARDLY MORE RATIONAL AND HEALTHY THAN THAT
CHILD'S MIND MUST HAVE BEEN
I SELDOM CAUGHT A WORD OF HER PRAYERS FOR THEY WERE WHISPERED LOW
SOMETIMES INDEED THEY WERE NOT WHISPERED AT ALL BUT PUT UP
UNUTTERED SUCH RARE SENTENCES AS REACHED MY EAR STILL BORE THE BURDEN
PAPA MY DEAR PAPA THIS I PERCEIVED WAS A ONE IDEA'D NATURE
BETRAYING THAT MONOMANIAC TENDENCY I HAVE EVER THOUGHT THE MOST
UNFORTUNATE WITH WHICH MAN OR WOMAN CAN BE CURSED
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE END OF THIS FRETTING HAD IT CONTINUED
UNCHECKED CAN ONLY BE CONJECTURED IT RECEIVED HOWEVER A SUDDEN TURN
ONE AFTERNOON MRS
BRETTON COAXING HER FROM HER USUAL STATION IN A
CORNER HAD LIFTED HER INTO THE WINDOW SEAT AND BY WAY OF OCCUPYING
HER ATTENTION TOLD HER TO WATCH THE PASSENGERS AND COUNT HOW MANY
LADIES SHOULD GO DOWN THE STREET IN A GIVEN TIME
SHE HAD SAT
LISTLESSLY HARDLY LOOKING AND NOT COUNTING WHEN MY EYE BEING FIXED
ON HERS I WITNESSED IN ITS IRIS AND PUPIL A STARTLING TRANSFIGURATION
THESE SUDDEN DANGEROUS NATURES SENSITIVE AS THEY ARE CALLED OFFER
MANY A CURIOUS SPECTACLE TO THOSE WHOM A COOLER TEMPERAMENT HAS SECURED
FROM PARTICIPATION IN THEIR ANGULAR VAGARIES
THE FIXED AND HEAVY GAZE
SWUM TREMBLED THEN GLITTERED IN FIRE THE SMALL OVERCAST BROW
CLEARED THE TRIVIAL AND DEJECTED FEATURES LIT UP THE SAD COUNTENANCE
VANISHED AND IN ITS PLACE APPEARED A SUDDEN EAGERNESS AN INTENSE
EXPECTANCY
IT IS WERE HER WORDS
LIKE A BIRD OR A SHAFT OR ANY OTHER SWIFT THING SHE WAS GONE FROM THE
ROOM HOW SHE GOT THE HOUSE DOOR OPEN I CANNOT TELL PROBABLY IT MIGHT
BE AJAR PERHAPS WARREN WAS IN THE WAY AND OBEYED HER BEHEST WHICH
WOULD BE IMPETUOUS ENOUGH
I WATCHING CALMLY FROM THE WINDOW SAW HER
IN HER BLACK FROCK AND TINY BRAIDED APRON TO PINAFORES SHE HAD AN
ANTIPATHY DART HALF THE LENGTH OF THE STREET AND AS I WAS ON THE
POINT OF TURNING AND QUIETLY ANNOUNCING TO MRS
BRETTON THAT THE CHILD
WAS RUN OUT MAD AND OUGHT INSTANTLY TO BE PURSUED I SAW HER CAUGHT
UP AND RAPT AT ONCE FROM MY COOL OBSERVATION AND FROM THE WONDERING
STARE OF THE PASSENGERS
A GENTLEMAN HAD DONE THIS GOOD TURN AND NOW
COVERING HER WITH HIS CLOAK ADVANCED TO RESTORE HER TO THE HOUSE
WHENCE HE HAD SEEN HER ISSUE
I CONCLUDED HE WOULD LEAVE HER IN A SERVANT'S CHARGE AND WITHDRAW BUT
HE ENTERED HAVING TARRIED A LITTLE WHILE BELOW HE CAME UP STAIRS
HIS RECEPTION IMMEDIATELY EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS KNOWN TO MRS
BRETTON
SHE RECOGNISED HIM SHE GREETED HIM AND YET SHE WAS FLUTTERED
SURPRISED TAKEN UNAWARES
HER LOOK AND MANNER WERE EVEN EXPOSTULATORY
AND IN REPLY TO THESE RATHER THAN HER WORDS HE SAID I COULD NOT
HELP IT MADAM I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITHOUT
SEEING WITH MY OWN EYES HOW SHE SETTLED
BUT YOU WILL UNSETTLE HER
I HOPE NOT
AND HOW IS PAPA'S LITTLE POLLY
THIS QUESTION HE ADDRESSED TO PAULINA AS HE SAT DOWN AND PLACED HER
GENTLY ON THE GROUND BEFORE HIM
HOW IS POLLY'S PAPA WAS THE REPLY AS SHE LEANED ON HIS KNEE AND
GAZED UP INTO HIS FACE
IT WAS NOT A NOISY NOT A WORDY SCENE FOR THAT I WAS THANKFUL BUT IT
WAS A SCENE OF FEELING TOO BRIMFUL AND WHICH BECAUSE THE CUP DID NOT
FOAM UP HIGH OR FURIOUSLY OVERFLOW ONLY OPPRESSED ONE THE MORE
ON ALL
OCCASIONS OF VEHEMENT UNRESTRAINED EXPANSION A SENSE OF DISDAIN OR
RIDICULE COMES TO THE WEARY SPECTATOR'S RELIEF WHEREAS I HAVE EVER
FELT MOST BURDENSOME THAT SORT OF SENSIBILITY WHICH BENDS OF ITS OWN
WILL A GIANT SLAVE UNDER THE SWAY OF GOOD SENSE
MR
HOME WAS A STERN FEATURED PERHAPS I SHOULD RATHER SAY A
HARD FEATURED MAN HIS FOREHEAD WAS KNOTTY AND HIS CHEEKBONES WERE
MARKED AND PROMINENT
THE CHARACTER OF HIS FACE WAS QUITE SCOTCH BUT
THERE WAS FEELING IN HIS EYE AND EMOTION IN HIS NOW AGITATED
COUNTENANCE
HIS NORTHERN ACCENT IN SPEAKING HARMONISED WITH HIS
PHYSIOGNOMY
HE WAS AT ONCE PROUD LOOKING AND HOMELY LOOKING
HE LAID
HIS HAND ON THE CHILD'S UPLIFTED HEAD
SHE SAID KISS POLLY
HE KISSED HER
I WISHED SHE WOULD UTTER SOME HYSTERICAL CRY SO THAT I
MIGHT GET RELIEF AND BE AT EASE
SHE MADE WONDERFULLY LITTLE NOISE SHE
SEEMED TO HAVE GOT WHAT SHE WANTED ALL SHE WANTED AND TO BE IN A
TRANCE OF CONTENT
NEITHER IN MIEN NOR IN FEATURES WAS THIS CREATURE
LIKE HER SIRE AND YET SHE WAS OF HIS STRAIN HER MIND HAD BEEN FILLED
FROM HIS AS THE CUP FROM THE FLAGON
INDISPUTABLY MR
HOME OWNED MANLY SELF CONTROL HOWEVER HE MIGHT
SECRETLY FEEL ON SOME MATTERS
POLLY HE SAID LOOKING DOWN ON HIS
LITTLE GIRL GO INTO THE HALL YOU WILL SEE PAPA'S GREAT COAT LYING ON
A CHAIR PUT YOUR HAND INTO THE POCKETS YOU WILL FIND A
POCKET HANDKERCHIEF THERE BRING IT TO ME
SHE OBEYED WENT AND RETURNED DEFTLY AND NIMBLY
HE WAS TALKING TO MRS
BRETTON WHEN SHE CAME BACK AND SHE WAITED WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF IN HER
HAND
IT WAS A PICTURE IN ITS WAY TO SEE HER WITH HER TINY STATURE
AND TRIM NEAT SHAPE STANDING AT HIS KNEE
SEEING THAT HE CONTINUED TO
TALK APPARENTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF HER RETURN SHE TOOK HIS HAND OPENED
THE UNRESISTING FINGERS INSINUATED INTO THEM THE HANDKERCHIEF AND
CLOSED THEM UPON IT ONE BY ONE
HE STILL SEEMED NOT TO SEE OR TO FEEL
HER BUT BY AND BY HE LIFTED HER TO HIS KNEE SHE NESTLED AGAINST HIM
AND THOUGH NEITHER LOOKED AT NOR SPOKE TO THE OTHER FOR AN HOUR
FOLLOWING I SUPPOSE BOTH WERE SATISFIED
DURING TEA THE MINUTE THING'S MOVEMENTS AND BEHAVIOUR GAVE AS USUAL
FULL OCCUPATION TO THE EYE
FIRST SHE DIRECTED WARREN AS HE PLACED THE
CHAIRS
PUT PAPA'S CHAIR HERE AND MINE NEAR IT BETWEEN PAPA AND MRS
BRETTON I MUST HAND HIS TEA
SHE TOOK HER OWN SEAT AND BECKONED WITH HER HAND TO HER FATHER
BE NEAR ME AS IF WE WERE AT HOME PAPA
AND AGAIN AS SHE INTERCEPTED HIS CUP IN PASSING AND WOULD STIR THE
SUGAR AND PUT IN THE CREAM HERSELF I ALWAYS DID IT FOR YOU AT HOME
PAPA NOBODY COULD DO IT AS WELL NOT EVEN YOUR OWN SELF
THROUGHOUT THE MEAL SHE CONTINUED HER ATTENTIONS RATHER ABSURD THEY
WERE
THE SUGAR TONGS WERE TOO WIDE FOR ONE OF HER HANDS AND SHE HAD
TO USE BOTH IN WIELDING THEM THE WEIGHT OF THE SILVER CREAM EWER THE
BREAD AND BUTTER PLATES THE VERY CUP AND SAUCER TASKED HER
INSUFFICIENT STRENGTH AND DEXTERITY BUT SHE WOULD LIFT THIS HAND
THAT AND LUCKILY CONTRIVED THROUGH IT ALL TO BREAK NOTHING
CANDIDLY
SPEAKING I THOUGHT HER A LITTLE BUSY BODY BUT HER FATHER BLIND LIKE
OTHER PARENTS SEEMED PERFECTLY CONTENT TO LET HER WAIT ON HIM AND
EVEN WONDERFULLY SOOTHED BY HER OFFICES
SHE IS MY COMFORT HE COULD NOT HELP SAYING TO MRS
BRETTON
THAT
LADY HAD HER OWN COMFORT AND NONPAREIL ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE AND
FOR THE MOMENT ABSENT SO SHE SYMPATHISED WITH HIS FOIBLE
THIS SECOND COMFORT CAME ON THE STAGE IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING
I
KNEW THIS DAY HAD BEEN FIXED FOR HIS RETURN AND WAS AWARE THAT MRS
BRETTON HAD BEEN EXPECTING HIM THROUGH ALL ITS HOURS
WE WERE SEATED
ROUND THE FIRE AFTER TEA WHEN GRAHAM JOINED OUR CIRCLE I SHOULD
RATHER SAY BROKE IT UP FOR OF COURSE HIS ARRIVAL MADE A BUSTLE AND
THEN AS MR
GRAHAM WAS FASTING THERE WAS REFRESHMENT TO BE PROVIDED
HE AND MR
HOME MET AS OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF THE LITTLE GIRL HE TOOK NO
NOTICE FOR A TIME
HIS MEAL OVER AND NUMEROUS QUESTIONS FROM HIS MOTHER ANSWERED HE
TURNED FROM THE TABLE TO THE HEARTH
OPPOSITE WHERE HE HAD PLACED
HIMSELF WAS SEATED MR
HOME AND AT HIS ELBOW THE CHILD
WHEN I SAY
CHILD I USE AN INAPPROPRIATE AND UNDESCRIPTIVE TERM A TERM
SUGGESTING ANY PICTURE RATHER THAN THAT OF THE DEMURE LITTLE PERSON IN
A MOURNING FROCK AND WHITE CHEMISETTE THAT MIGHT JUST HAVE FITTED A
GOOD SIZED DOLL PERCHED NOW ON A HIGH CHAIR BESIDE A STAND WHEREON
WAS HER TOY WORK BOX OF WHITE VARNISHED WOOD AND HOLDING IN HER HANDS
A SHRED OF A HANDKERCHIEF WHICH SHE WAS PROFESSING TO HEM AND AT
WHICH SHE BORED PERSEVERINGLY WITH A NEEDLE THAT IN HER FINGERS SEEMED
ALMOST A SKEWER PRICKING HERSELF EVER AND ANON MARKING THE CAMBRIC
WITH A TRACK OF MINUTE RED DOTS OCCASIONALLY STARTING WHEN THE
PERVERSE WEAPON SWERVING FROM HER CONTROL INFLICTED A DEEPER STAB
THAN USUAL BUT STILL SILENT DILIGENT ABSORBED WOMANLY
GRAHAM WAS AT THAT TIME A HANDSOME FAITHLESS LOOKING YOUTH OF SIXTEEN
I SAY FAITHLESS LOOKING NOT BECAUSE HE WAS REALLY OF A VERY PERFIDIOUS
DISPOSITION BUT BECAUSE THE EPITHET STRIKES ME AS PROPER TO DESCRIBE
THE FAIR CELTIC NOT SAXON CHARACTER OF HIS GOOD LOOKS HIS WAVED
LIGHT AUBURN HAIR HIS SUPPLE SYMMETRY HIS SMILE FREQUENT AND
DESTITUTE NEITHER OF FASCINATION NOR OF SUBTLETY IN NO BAD SENSE
A
SPOILED WHIMSICAL BOY HE WAS IN THOSE DAYS
MOTHER HE SAID AFTER EYEING THE LITTLE FIGURE BEFORE HIM IN SILENCE
FOR SOME TIME AND WHEN THE TEMPORARY ABSENCE OF MR
HOME FROM THE ROOM
RELIEVED HIM FROM THE HALF LAUGHING BASHFULNESS WHICH WAS ALL HE KNEW
OF TIMIDITY MOTHER I SEE A YOUNG LADY IN THE PRESENT SOCIETY TO
WHOM I HAVE NOT BEEN INTRODUCED
MR
HOME'S LITTLE GIRL I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN SAID HIS MOTHER
INDEED MA'AM REPLIED HER SON I CONSIDER YOUR EXPRESSION OF THE
LEAST CEREMONIOUS MISS HOME I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SAID IN
VENTURING TO SPEAK OF THE GENTLEWOMAN TO WHOM I ALLUDE
NOW GRAHAM I WILL NOT HAVE THAT CHILD TEASED
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF
THAT I SHALL SUFFER YOU TO MAKE HER YOUR BUTT
MISS HOME PURSUED GRAHAM UNDETERRED BY HIS MOTHER'S REMONSTRANCE
MIGHT I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INTRODUCE MYSELF SINCE NO ONE ELSE SEEMS
WILLING TO RENDER YOU AND ME THAT SERVICE YOUR SLAVE JOHN GRAHAM
BRETTON
SHE LOOKED AT HIM HE ROSE AND BOWED QUITE GRAVELY
SHE DELIBERATELY
PUT DOWN THIMBLE SCISSORS WORK DESCENDED WITH PRECAUTION FROM HER
PERCH AND CURTSYING WITH UNSPEAKABLE SERIOUSNESS SAID HOW DO YOU
DO
I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE IN FAIR HEALTH ONLY IN SOME MEASURE FATIGUED
WITH A HURRIED JOURNEY
I HOPE MA'AM I SEE YOU WELL
TOR RER ABLY WELL WAS THE AMBITIOUS REPLY OF THE LITTLE WOMAN AND
SHE NOW ESSAYED TO REGAIN HER FORMER ELEVATION BUT FINDING THIS COULD
NOT BE DONE WITHOUT SOME CLIMBING AND STRAINING A SACRIFICE OF DECORUM
NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF AND BEING UTTERLY DISDAINFUL OF AID IN THE
PRESENCE OF A STRANGE YOUNG GENTLEMAN SHE RELINQUISHED THE HIGH CHAIR
FOR A LOW STOOL TOWARDS THAT LOW STOOL GRAHAM DREW IN HIS CHAIR
I HOPE MA'AM THE PRESENT RESIDENCE MY MOTHER'S HOUSE APPEARS TO
YOU A CONVENIENT PLACE OF ABODE
NOT PAR TIC ER ER LY I WANT TO GO HOME
A NATURAL AND LAUDABLE DESIRE MA'AM BUT ONE WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING
I SHALL DO MY BEST TO OPPOSE
I RECKON ON BEING ABLE TO GET OUT OF YOU
A LITTLE OF THAT PRECIOUS COMMODITY CALLED AMUSEMENT WHICH MAMMA AND
MISTRESS SNOWE THERE FAIL TO YIELD ME
I SHALL HAVE TO GO WITH PAPA SOON I SHALL NOT STAY LONG AT YOUR
MOTHER'S
YES YES YOU WILL STAY WITH ME I AM SURE
I HAVE A PONY ON WHICH YOU
SHALL RIDE AND NO END OF BOOKS WITH PICTURES TO SHOW YOU
ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE HERE NOW
I AM
DOES THAT PLEASE YOU DO YOU LIKE ME
NO
WHY
I THINK YOU QUEER
MY FACE MA'AM
YOUR FACE AND ALL ABOUT YOU YOU HAVE LONG RED HAIR
AUBURN HAIR IF YOU PLEASE MAMMA CALLS IT AUBURN OR GOLDEN AND SO
DO ALL HER FRIENDS
BUT EVEN WITH MY 'LONG RED HAIR' AND HE WAVED HIS
MANE WITH A SORT OF TRIUMPH TAWNY HE HIMSELF WELL KNEW THAT IT WAS
AND HE WAS PROUD OF THE LEONINE HUE I CANNOT POSSIBLY BE QUEERER
THAN IS YOUR LADYSHIP
YOU CALL ME QUEER
CERTAINLY
AFTER A PAUSE I THINK I SHALL GO TO BED
A LITTLE THING LIKE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN IN BED MANY HOURS SINCE
BUT YOU PROBABLY SAT UP IN THE EXPECTATION OF SEEING ME
NO INDEED
YOU CERTAINLY WISHED TO ENJOY THE PLEASURE OF MY SOCIETY
YOU KNEW I
WAS COMING HOME AND WOULD WAIT TO HAVE A LOOK AT ME
I SAT UP FOR PAPA AND NOT FOR YOU
VERY GOOD MISS HOME
I AM GOING TO BE A FAVOURITE PREFERRED BEFORE
PAPA SOON I DARESAY
SHE WISHED MRS
BRETTON AND MYSELF GOOD NIGHT SHE SEEMED HESITATING
WHETHER GRAHAM'S DESERTS ENTITLED HIM TO THE SAME ATTENTION WHEN HE
CAUGHT HER UP WITH ONE HAND AND WITH THAT ONE HAND HELD HER POISED
ALOFT ABOVE HIS HEAD
SHE SAW HERSELF THUS LIFTED UP ON HIGH IN THE
GLASS OVER THE FIREPLACE
THE SUDDENNESS THE FREEDOM THE DISRESPECT
OF THE ACTION WERE TOO MUCH
FOR SHAME MR
GRAHAM WAS HER INDIGNANT CRY PUT ME DOWN AND
WHEN AGAIN ON HER FEET I WONDER WHAT YOU WOULD THINK OF ME IF I WERE
TO TREAT YOU IN THAT WAY LIFTING YOU WITH MY HAND RAISING THAT
MIGHTY MEMBER AS WARREN LIFTS THE LITTLE CAT
SO SAYING SHE DEPARTED
CHAPTER III
THE PLAYMATES
MR
HOME STAYED TWO DAYS
DURING HIS VISIT HE COULD NOT BE PREVAILED ON
TO GO OUT HE SAT ALL DAY LONG BY THE FIRESIDE SOMETIMES SILENT
SOMETIMES RECEIVING AND ANSWERING MRS
BRETTON'S CHAT WHICH WAS JUST
OF THE PROPER SORT FOR A MAN IN HIS MORBID MOOD NOT OVER SYMPATHETIC
YET NOT TOO UNCONGENIAL SENSIBLE AND EVEN WITH A TOUCH OF THE
MOTHERLY SHE WAS SUFFICIENTLY HIS SENIOR TO BE PERMITTED THIS TOUCH
AS TO PAULINA THE CHILD WAS AT ONCE HAPPY AND MUTE BUSY AND WATCHFUL
HER FATHER FREQUENTLY LIFTED HER TO HIS KNEE SHE WOULD SIT THERE TILL
SHE FELT OR FANCIED HE GREW RESTLESS THEN IT WAS PAPA PUT ME DOWN
I SHALL TIRE YOU WITH MY WEIGHT
AND THE MIGHTY BURDEN SLID TO THE RUG AND ESTABLISHING ITSELF ON
CARPET OR STOOL JUST AT PAPA'S FEET THE WHITE WORK BOX AND THE
SCARLET SPECKLED HANDKERCHIEF CAME INTO PLAY
THIS HANDKERCHIEF IT
SEEMS WAS INTENDED AS A KEEPSAKE FOR PAPA AND MUST BE FINISHED
BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE CONSEQUENTLY THE DEMAND ON THE SEMPSTRESS'S
INDUSTRY SHE ACCOMPLISHED ABOUT A SCORE OF STITCHES IN HALF AN HOUR
WAS STRINGENT
THE EVENING BY RESTORING GRAHAM TO THE MATERNAL ROOF HIS DAYS WERE
PASSED AT SCHOOL BROUGHT US AN ACCESSION OF ANIMATION A QUALITY NOT
DIMINISHED BY THE NATURE OF THE SCENES PRETTY SURE TO BE ENACTED
BETWEEN HIM AND MISS PAULINA
A DISTANT AND HAUGHTY DEMEANOUR HAD BEEN THE RESULT OF THE INDIGNITY
PUT UPON HER THE FIRST EVENING OF HIS ARRIVAL HER USUAL ANSWER WHEN
HE ADDRESSED HER WAS I CAN'T ATTEND TO YOU I HAVE OTHER THINGS TO
THINK ABOUT BEING IMPLORED TO STATE WHAT THINGS
BUSINESS
GRAHAM WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO SEDUCE HER ATTENTION BY OPENING HIS DESK AND
DISPLAYING ITS MULTIFARIOUS CONTENTS SEALS BRIGHT STICKS OF WAX
PEN KNIVES WITH A MISCELLANY OF ENGRAVINGS SOME OF THEM GAILY
COLOURED WHICH HE HAD AMASSED FROM TIME TO TIME
NOR WAS THIS POWERFUL
TEMPTATION WHOLLY UNAVAILING HER EYES FURTIVELY RAISED FROM HER WORK
CAST MANY A PEEP TOWARDS THE WRITING TABLE RICH IN SCATTERED PICTURES
AN ETCHING OF A CHILD PLAYING WITH A BLENHEIM SPANIEL HAPPENED TO
FLUTTER TO THE FLOOR
PRETTY LITTLE DOG SAID SHE DELIGHTED
GRAHAM PRUDENTLY TOOK NO NOTICE
ERE LONG STEALING FROM HER CORNER
SHE APPROACHED TO EXAMINE THE TREASURE MORE CLOSELY
THE DOG'S GREAT
EYES AND LONG EARS AND THE CHILD'S HAT AND FEATHERS WERE IRRESISTIBLE
NICE PICTURE WAS HER FAVOURABLE CRITICISM
WELL YOU MAY HAVE IT SAID GRAHAM
SHE SEEMED TO HESITATE
THE WISH TO POSSESS WAS STRONG BUT TO ACCEPT
WOULD BE A COMPROMISE OF DIGNITY
NO
SHE PUT IT DOWN AND TURNED AWAY
YOU WON'T HAVE IT THEN POLLY
I WOULD RATHER NOT THANK YOU
SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE PICTURE IF YOU REFUSE IT
SHE HALF TURNED TO LISTEN
CUT IT INTO STRIPS FOR LIGHTING THE TAPER
NO
BUT I SHALL
PLEASE DON'T
GRAHAM WAXED INEXORABLE ON HEARING THE PLEADING TONE HE TOOK THE
SCISSORS FROM HIS MOTHER'S WORK BASKET
HERE GOES SAID HE MAKING A MENACING FLOURISH
RIGHT THROUGH FIDO'S
HEAD AND SPLITTING LITTLE HARRY'S NOSE
NO NO NO
THEN COME TO ME
COME QUICKLY OR IT IS DONE
SHE HESITATED LINGERED BUT COMPLIED
NOW WILL YOU HAVE IT HE ASKED AS SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM
PLEASE
BUT I SHALL WANT PAYMENT
HOW MUCH
A KISS
GIVE THE PICTURE FIRST INTO MY HAND
POLLY AS SHE SAID THIS LOOKED RATHER FAITHLESS IN HER TURN
GRAHAM
GAVE IT
SHE ABSCONDED A DEBTOR DARTED TO HER FATHER AND TOOK REFUGE
ON HIS KNEE
GRAHAM ROSE IN MIMIC WRATH AND FOLLOWED
SHE BURIED HER
FACE IN MR
HOME'S WAISTCOAT
PAPA PAPA SEND HIM AWAY
I'LL NOT BE SENT AWAY SAID GRAHAM
WITH FACE STILL AVERTED SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO KEEP HIM OFF
THEN I SHALL KISS THE HAND SAID HE BUT THAT MOMENT IT BECAME A
MINIATURE FIST AND DEALT HIM PAYMENT IN A SMALL COIN THAT WAS NOT
KISSES
GRAHAM NOT FAILING IN HIS WAY TO BE AS WILY AS HIS LITTLE
PLAYMATE RETREATED APPARENTLY QUITE DISCOMFITED HE FLUNG HIMSELF ON A
SOFA AND RESTING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE CUSHION LAY LIKE ONE IN PAIN
POLLY FINDING HIM SILENT PRESENTLY PEEPED AT HIM
HIS EYES AND FACE
WERE COVERED WITH HIS HANDS
SHE TURNED ON HER FATHER'S KNEE AND GAZED
AT HER FOE ANXIOUSLY AND LONG
GRAHAM GROANED
PAPA WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE WHISPERED
YOU HAD BETTER ASK HIM POLLY
IS HE HURT GROAN SECOND
HE MAKES A NOISE AS IF HE WERE SAID MR
HOME
MOTHER SUGGESTED GRAHAM FEEBLY I THINK YOU HAD BETTER SEND FOR
THE DOCTOR
OH MY EYE RENEWED SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY SIGHS FROM
GRAHAM
IF I WERE TO BECOME BLIND SUGGESTED THIS LAST
HIS CHASTISER COULD NOT BEAR THE SUGGESTION
SHE WAS BESIDE HIM
DIRECTLY
LET ME SEE YOUR EYE I DID NOT MEAN TO TOUCH IT ONLY YOUR MOUTH AND
I DID NOT THINK I HIT SO VERY HARD
SILENCE ANSWERED HER
HER FEATURES WORKED I AM SORRY I AM SORRY
THEN SUCCEEDED EMOTION FALTERING WEEPING
HAVE DONE TRYING THAT CHILD GRAHAM SAID MRS
BRETTON
IT IS ALL NONSENSE MY PET CRIED MR
HOME
AND GRAHAM ONCE MORE SNATCHED HER ALOFT AND SHE AGAIN PUNISHED HIM
AND WHILE SHE PULLED HIS LION'S LOCKS TERMED HIM THE NAUGHTIEST
RUDEST WORST UNTRUEST PERSON THAT EVER WAS
ON THE MORNING OF MR
HOME'S DEPARTURE HE AND HIS DAUGHTER HAD SOME
CONVERSATION IN A WINDOW RECESS BY THEMSELVES I HEARD PART OF IT
COULDN'T I PACK MY BOX AND GO WITH YOU PAPA SHE WHISPERED EARNESTLY
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
SHOULD I BE A TROUBLE TO YOU
YES POLLY
BECAUSE I AM LITTLE
BECAUSE YOU ARE LITTLE AND TENDER
IT IS ONLY GREAT STRONG PEOPLE
THAT SHOULD TRAVEL
BUT DON'T LOOK SAD MY LITTLE GIRL IT BREAKS MY
HEART
PAPA WILL SOON COME BACK TO HIS POLLY
INDEED INDEED I AM NOT SAD SCARCELY AT ALL
POLLY WOULD BE SORRY TO GIVE PAPA PAIN WOULD SHE NOT
SORRIER THAN SORRY
THEN POLLY MUST BE CHEERFUL NOT CRY AT PARTING NOT FRET AFTERWARDS
SHE MUST LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING AGAIN AND TRY TO BE HAPPY MEANWHILE
CAN SHE DO THIS
SHE WILL TRY
I SEE SHE WILL
FAREWELL THEN
IT IS TIME TO GO
NOW JUST NOW
JUST NOW
SHE HELD UP QUIVERING LIPS
HER FATHER SOBBED BUT SHE I REMARKED DID
NOT
HAVING PUT HER DOWN HE SHOOK HANDS WITH THE REST PRESENT AND
DEPARTED
WHEN THE STREET DOOR CLOSED SHE DROPPED ON HER KNEES AT A CHAIR WITH A
CRY PAPA
IT WAS LOW AND LONG A SORT OF WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME DURING AN
ENSUING SPACE OF SOME MINUTES I PERCEIVED SHE ENDURED AGONY
SHE WENT
THROUGH IN THAT BRIEF INTERVAL OF HER INFANT LIFE EMOTIONS SUCH AS
SOME NEVER FEEL IT WAS IN HER CONSTITUTION SHE WOULD HAVE MORE OF
SUCH INSTANTS IF SHE LIVED
NOBODY SPOKE
MRS
BRETTON BEING A MOTHER
SHED A TEAR OR TWO
GRAHAM WHO WAS WRITING LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND
GAZED AT HER
I LUCY SNOWE WAS CALM
THE LITTLE CREATURE THUS LEFT UNHARASSED DID FOR HERSELF WHAT NONE
OTHER COULD DO CONTENDED WITH AN INTOLERABLE FEELING AND ERE LONG
IN SOME DEGREE REPRESSED IT
THAT DAY SHE WOULD ACCEPT SOLACE FROM
NONE NOR THE NEXT DAY SHE GREW MORE PASSIVE AFTERWARDS
ON THE THIRD EVENING AS SHE SAT ON THE FLOOR WORN AND QUIET GRAHAM
COMING IN TOOK HER UP GENTLY WITHOUT A WORD
SHE DID NOT RESIST SHE
RATHER NESTLED IN HIS ARMS AS IF WEARY
WHEN HE SAT DOWN SHE LAID HER
HEAD AGAINST HIM IN A FEW MINUTES SHE SLEPT HE CARRIED HER UPSTAIRS
TO BED
I WAS NOT SURPRISED THAT THE NEXT MORNING THE FIRST THING SHE
DEMANDED WAS WHERE IS MR
GRAHAM
IT HAPPENED THAT GRAHAM WAS NOT COMING TO THE BREAKFAST TABLE HE HAD
SOME EXERCISES TO WRITE FOR THAT MORNING'S CLASS AND HAD REQUESTED HIS
MOTHER TO SEND A CUP OF TEA INTO THE STUDY
POLLY VOLUNTEERED TO CARRY
IT SHE MUST BE BUSY ABOUT SOMETHING LOOK AFTER SOMEBODY
THE CUP WAS
ENTRUSTED TO HER FOR IF RESTLESS SHE WAS ALSO CAREFUL
AS THE STUDY
WAS OPPOSITE THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE DOORS FACING ACROSS THE PASSAGE
MY EYE FOLLOWED HER
WHAT ARE YOU DOING SHE ASKED PAUSING ON THE THRESHOLD
WRITING SAID GRAHAM
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO TAKE BREAKFAST WITH YOUR MAMMA
TOO BUSY
DO YOU WANT ANY BREAKFAST
OF COURSE
THERE THEN
AND SHE DEPOSITED THE CUP ON THE CARPET LIKE A JAILOR PUTTING A
PRISONER'S PITCHER OF WATER THROUGH HIS CELL DOOR AND RETREATED
PRESENTLY SHE RETURNED
WHAT WILL YOU HAVE BESIDES TEA WHAT TO EAT
ANYTHING GOOD
BRING ME SOMETHING PARTICULARLY NICE THAT'S A KIND
LITTLE WOMAN
SHE CAME BACK TO MRS
BRETTON
PLEASE MA'AM SEND YOUR BOY SOMETHING GOOD
YOU SHALL CHOOSE FOR HIM POLLY WHAT SHALL MY BOY HAVE
SHE SELECTED A PORTION OF WHATEVER WAS BEST ON THE TABLE AND ERE
LONG CAME BACK WITH A WHISPERED REQUEST FOR SOME MARMALADE WHICH WAS
NOT THERE
HAVING GOT IT HOWEVER FOR MRS
BRETTON REFUSED THE PAIR
NOTHING GRAHAM WAS SHORTLY AFTER HEARD LAUDING HER TO THE SKIES
PROMISING THAT WHEN HE HAD A HOUSE OF HIS OWN SHE SHOULD BE HIS
HOUSEKEEPER AND PERHAPS IF SHE SHOWED ANY CULINARY GENIUS HIS COOK
AND AS SHE DID NOT RETURN AND I WENT TO LOOK AFTER HER I FOUND
GRAHAM AND HER BREAKFASTING TTE TTE SHE STANDING AT HIS ELBOW
AND SHARING HIS FARE EXCEPTING THE MARMALADE WHICH SHE DELICATELY
REFUSED TO TOUCH LEST I SUPPOSE IT SHOULD APPEAR THAT SHE HAD
PROCURED IT AS MUCH ON HER OWN ACCOUNT AS HIS
SHE CONSTANTLY EVINCED
THESE NICE PERCEPTIONS AND DELICATE INSTINCTS
THE LEAGUE OF ACQUAINTANCESHIP THUS STRUCK UP WAS NOT HASTILY
DISSOLVED ON THE CONTRARY IT APPEARED THAT TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCES
SERVED RATHER TO CEMENT THAN LOOSEN IT
ILL ASSIMILATED AS THE TWO WERE
IN AGE SEX PURSUITS C THEY SOMEHOW FOUND A GREAT DEAL TO SAY TO
EACH OTHER
AS TO PAULINA I OBSERVED THAT HER LITTLE CHARACTER NEVER
PROPERLY CAME OUT EXCEPT WITH YOUNG BRETTON
AS SHE GOT SETTLED AND
ACCUSTOMED TO THE HOUSE SHE PROVED TRACTABLE ENOUGH WITH MRS
BRETTON
BUT SHE WOULD SIT ON A STOOL AT THAT LADY'S FEET ALL DAY LONG LEARNING
HER TASK OR SEWING OR DRAWING FIGURES WITH A PENCIL ON A SLATE AND
NEVER KINDLING ONCE TO ORIGINALITY OR SHOWING A SINGLE GLEAM OF THE
PECULIARITIES OF HER NATURE
I CEASED TO WATCH HER UNDER SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS NOT INTERESTING
BUT THE MOMENT GRAHAM'S KNOCK
SOUNDED OF AN EVENING A CHANGE OCCURRED SHE WAS INSTANTLY AT THE HEAD
OF THE STAIRCASE
USUALLY HER WELCOME WAS A REPRIMAND OR A THREAT
YOU HAVE NOT WIPED YOUR SHOES PROPERLY ON THE MAT
I SHALL TELL YOUR
MAMMA
LITTLE BUSYBODY ARE YOU THERE
YES AND YOU CAN'T REACH ME I AM HIGHER UP THAN YOU PEEPING BETWEEN
THE RAILS OF THE BANISTER SHE COULD NOT LOOK OVER THEM
POLLY
MY DEAR BOY SUCH WAS ONE OF HER TERMS FOR HIM ADOPTED IN IMITATION
OF HIS MOTHER
I AM FIT TO FAINT WITH FATIGUE DECLARED GRAHAM LEANING AGAINST THE
PASSAGE WALL IN SEEMING EXHAUSTION
DR
DIGBY THE HEADMASTER HAS
QUITE KNOCKED ME UP WITH OVERWORK
JUST COME DOWN AND HELP ME TO CARRY
UP MY BOOKS
AH YOU'RE CUNNING
NOT AT ALL POLLY IT IS POSITIVE FACT
I'M AS WEAK AS A RUSH
COME
DOWN
YOUR EYES ARE QUIET LIKE THE CAT'S BUT YOU'LL SPRING
SPRING NOTHING OF THE KIND IT ISN'T IN ME
COME DOWN
PERHAPS I MAY IF YOU'LL PROMISE NOT TO TOUCH NOT TO SNATCH ME UP
AND NOT TO WHIRL ME ROUND
I I COULDN'T DO IT SINKING INTO A CHAIR
THEN PUT THE BOOKS DOWN ON THE FIRST STEP AND GO THREE YARDS OFF
THIS BEING DONE SHE DESCENDED WARILY AND NOT TAKING HER EYES FROM THE
FEEBLE GRAHAM
OF COURSE HER APPROACH ALWAYS GALVANIZED HIM TO NEW AND
SPASMODIC LIFE THE GAME OF ROMPS WAS SURE TO BE EXACTED
SOMETIMES SHE
WOULD BE ANGRY SOMETIMES THE MATTER WAS ALLOWED TO PASS SMOOTHLY AND
WE COULD HEAR HER SAY AS SHE LED HIM UP STAIRS NOW MY DEAR BOY COME
AND TAKE YOUR TEA I AM SURE YOU MUST WANT SOMETHING
IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMICAL TO OBSERVE HER AS SHE SAT BESIDE GRAHAM
WHILE HE TOOK THAT MEAL
IN HIS ABSENCE SHE WAS A STILL PERSONAGE BUT
WITH HIM THE MOST OFFICIOUS FIDGETY LITTLE BODY POSSIBLE
I OFTEN
WISHED SHE WOULD MIND HERSELF AND BE TRANQUIL BUT NO HERSELF WAS
FORGOTTEN IN HIM HE COULD NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY WELL WAITED ON NOR
CAREFULLY ENOUGH LOOKED AFTER HE WAS MORE THAN THE GRAND TURK IN HER
ESTIMATION
SHE WOULD GRADUALLY ASSEMBLE THE VARIOUS PLATES BEFORE HIM
AND WHEN ONE WOULD SUPPOSE ALL HE COULD POSSIBLY DESIRE WAS WITHIN HIS
REACH SHE WOULD FIND OUT SOMETHING ELSE MA'AM SHE WOULD WHISPER TO
MRS
BRETTON PERHAPS YOUR SON WOULD LIKE A LITTLE CAKE SWEET CAKE
YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME IN THERE POINTING TO THE SIDEBOARD CUPBOARD
MRS
BRETTON AS A RULE DISAPPROVED OF SWEET CAKE AT TEA BUT STILL
THE REQUEST WAS URGED ONE LITTLE PIECE ONLY FOR HIM AS HE GOES TO
SCHOOL GIRLS SUCH AS ME AND MISS SNOWE DON'T NEED TREATS BUT HE
WOULD LIKE IT
GRAHAM DID LIKE IT VERY WELL AND ALMOST ALWAYS GOT IT
TO DO HIM
JUSTICE HE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS PRIZE WITH HER TO WHOM HE OWED IT
BUT THAT WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO INSIST WAS TO RUFFLE HER FOR THE
EVENING
TO STAND BY HIS KNEE AND MONOPOLIZE HIS TALK AND NOTICE WAS
THE REWARD SHE WANTED NOT A SHARE OF THE CAKE
WITH CURIOUS READINESS DID SHE ADAPT HERSELF TO SUCH THEMES AS
INTERESTED HIM
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE CHILD HAD NO MIND OR LIFE OF
HER OWN BUT MUST NECESSARILY LIVE MOVE AND HAVE HER BEING IN
ANOTHER NOW THAT HER FATHER WAS TAKEN FROM HER SHE NESTLED TO GRAHAM
AND SEEMED TO FEEL BY HIS FEELINGS TO EXIST IN HIS EXISTENCE
SHE
LEARNED THE NAMES OF ALL HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS IN A TRICE SHE GOT BY HEART
THEIR CHARACTERS AS GIVEN FROM HIS LIPS A SINGLE DESCRIPTION OF AN
INDIVIDUAL SEEMED TO SUFFICE
SHE NEVER FORGOT OR CONFUSED IDENTITIES
SHE WOULD TALK WITH HIM THE WHOLE EVENING ABOUT PEOPLE SHE HAD NEVER
SEEN AND APPEAR COMPLETELY TO REALISE THEIR ASPECT MANNERS AND
DISPOSITIONS
SOME SHE LEARNED TO MIMIC AN UNDER MASTER WHO WAS AN
AVERSION OF YOUNG BRETTON'S HAD IT SEEMS SOME PECULIARITIES WHICH
SHE CAUGHT UP IN A MOMENT FROM GRAHAM'S REPRESENTATION AND REHEARSED
FOR HIS AMUSEMENT THIS HOWEVER MRS
BRETTON DISAPPROVED AND FORBADE
THE PAIR SELDOM QUARRELLED YET ONCE A RUPTURE OCCURRED IN WHICH HER
FEELINGS RECEIVED A SEVERE SHOCK
ONE DAY GRAHAM ON THE OCCASION OF HIS BIRTHDAY HAD SOME FRIENDS LADS
OF HIS OWN AGE TO DINE WITH HIM
PAULINA TOOK MUCH INTEREST IN THE
COMING OF THESE FRIENDS SHE HAD FREQUENTLY HEARD OF THEM THEY WERE
AMONGST THOSE OF WHOM GRAHAM OFTENEST SPOKE
AFTER DINNER THE YOUNG
GENTLEMEN WERE LEFT BY THEMSELVES IN THE DINING ROOM WHERE THEY SOON
BECAME VERY MERRY AND MADE A GOOD DEAL OF NOISE
CHANCING TO PASS
THROUGH THE HALL I FOUND PAULINA SITTING ALONE ON THE LOWEST STEP OF
THE STAIRCASE HER EYES FIXED ON THE GLOSSY PANELS OF THE DINING ROOM
DOOR WHERE THE REFLECTION OF THE HALL LAMP WAS SHINING HER LITTLE
BROW KNIT IN ANXIOUS MEDITATION
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT POLLY
NOTHING PARTICULAR ONLY I WISH THAT DOOR WAS CLEAR GLASS THAT I
MIGHT SEE THROUGH IT
THE BOYS SEEM VERY CHEERFUL AND I WANT TO GO TO
THEM I WANT TO BE WITH GRAHAM AND WATCH HIS FRIENDS
WHAT HINDERS YOU FROM GOING
I FEEL AFRAID BUT MAY I TRY DO YOU THINK MAY I KNOCK AT THE DOOR
AND ASK TO BE LET IN
I THOUGHT PERHAPS THEY MIGHT NOT OBJECT TO HAVE HER AS A PLAYMATE AND
THEREFORE ENCOURAGED THE ATTEMPT
SHE KNOCKED TOO FAINTLY AT FIRST TO BE HEARD BUT ON A SECOND ESSAY
THE DOOR UNCLOSED GRAHAM'S HEAD APPEARED HE LOOKED IN HIGH SPIRITS
BUT IMPATIENT
WHAT DO YOU WANT YOU LITTLE MONKEY
TO COME TO YOU
DO YOU INDEED AS IF I WOULD BE TROUBLED WITH YOU AWAY TO MAMMA AND
MISTRESS SNOWE AND TELL THEM TO PUT YOU TO BED THE AUBURN HEAD AND
BRIGHT FLUSHED FACE VANISHED THE DOOR SHUT PEREMPTORILY
SHE WAS
STUNNED
WHY DOES HE SPEAK SO HE NEVER SPOKE SO BEFORE SHE SAID IN
CONSTERNATION
WHAT HAVE I DONE
NOTHING POLLY BUT GRAHAM IS BUSY WITH HIS SCHOOL FRIENDS
AND HE LIKES THEM BETTER THAN ME HE TURNS ME AWAY NOW THEY ARE HERE
I HAD SOME THOUGHTS OF CONSOLING HER AND OF IMPROVING THE OCCASION BY
INCULCATING SOME OF THOSE MAXIMS OF PHILOSOPHY WHEREOF I HAD EVER A
TOLERABLE STOCK READY FOR APPLICATION
SHE STOPPED ME HOWEVER BY
PUTTING HER FINGERS IN HER EARS AT THE FIRST WORDS I UTTERED AND THEN
LYING DOWN ON THE MAT WITH HER FACE AGAINST THE FLAGS NOR COULD EITHER
WARREN OR THE COOK ROOT HER FROM THAT POSITION SHE WAS ALLOWED TO LIE
THEREFORE TILL SHE CHOSE TO RISE OF HER OWN ACCORD
GRAHAM FORGOT HIS IMPATIENCE THE SAME EVENING AND WOULD HAVE ACCOSTED
HER AS USUAL WHEN HIS FRIENDS WERE GONE BUT SHE WRENCHED HERSELF FROM
HIS HAND HER EYE QUITE FLASHED SHE WOULD NOT BID HIM GOOD NIGHT SHE
WOULD NOT LOOK IN HIS FACE
THE NEXT DAY HE TREATED HER WITH
INDIFFERENCE AND SHE GREW LIKE A BIT OF MARBLE
THE DAY AFTER HE
TEASED HER TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER HER LIPS WOULD NOT UNCLOSE
OF
COURSE HE COULD NOT FEEL REAL ANGER ON HIS SIDE THE MATCH WAS TOO
UNEQUAL IN EVERY WAY HE TRIED SOOTHING AND COAXING
WHY WAS SHE SO
ANGRY WHAT HAD HE DONE BY AND BY TEARS ANSWERED HIM HE PETTED HER
AND THEY WERE FRIENDS
BUT SHE WAS ONE ON WHOM SUCH INCIDENTS WERE NOT
LOST I REMARKED THAT NEVER AFTER THIS REBUFF DID SHE SEEK HIM OR
FOLLOW HIM OR IN ANY WAY SOLICIT HIS NOTICE
I TOLD HER ONCE TO CARRY
A BOOK OR SOME OTHER ARTICLE TO GRAHAM WHEN HE WAS SHUT UP IN HIS STUDY
I SHALL WAIT TILL HE COMES OUT SAID SHE PROUDLY I DON'T CHOOSE TO
GIVE HIM THE TROUBLE OF RISING TO OPEN THE DOOR
YOUNG BRETTON HAD A FAVOURITE PONY ON WHICH HE OFTEN RODE OUT FROM THE
WINDOW SHE ALWAYS WATCHED HIS DEPARTURE AND RETURN
IT WAS HER AMBITION
TO BE PERMITTED TO HAVE A RIDE ROUND THE COURTYARD ON THIS PONY BUT
FAR BE IT FROM HER TO ASK SUCH A FAVOUR
ONE DAY SHE DESCENDED TO THE
YARD TO WATCH HIM DISMOUNT AS SHE LEANED AGAINST THE GATE THE LONGING
WISH FOR THE INDULGENCE OF A RIDE GLITTERED IN HER EYE
COME POLLY WILL YOU HAVE A CANTER ASKED GRAHAM HALF CARELESSLY
I SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT HE WAS TOO CARELESS
NO THANK YOU SAID SHE TURNING AWAY WITH THE UTMOST COOLNESS
YOU'D BETTER PURSUED HE
YOU WILL LIKE IT I AM SURE
DON'T THINK I SHOULD CARE A FIG ABOUT IT WAS THE RESPONSE
THAT IS NOT TRUE
YOU TOLD LUCY SNOWE YOU LONGED TO HAVE A RIDE
LUCY SNOWE IS A TATTER BOX I HEARD HER SAY HER IMPERFECT
ARTICULATION WAS THE LEAST PRECOCIOUS THING SHE HAD ABOUT HER AND
WITH THIS SHE WALKED INTO THE HOUSE
GRAHAM COMING IN SOON AFTER OBSERVED TO HIS MOTHER MAMMA I
BELIEVE THAT CREATURE IS A CHANGELING SHE IS A PERFECT CABINET OF
ODDITIES BUT I SHOULD BE DULL WITHOUT HER SHE AMUSES ME A GREAT DEAL
MORE THAN YOU OR LUCY SNOWE
MISS SNOWE SAID PAULINA TO ME SHE HAD NOW GOT INTO THE HABIT OF
OCCASIONALLY CHATTING WITH ME WHEN WE WERE ALONE IN OUR ROOM AT NIGHT
DO YOU KNOW ON WHAT DAY IN THE WEEK I LIKE GRAHAM BEST
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY KNOW ANYTHING SO STRANGE IS THERE ONE DAY OUT OF
THE SEVEN WHEN HE IS OTHERWISE THAN ON THE OTHER SIX
TO BE SURE CAN'T YOU SEE DON'T YOU KNOW I FIND HIM THE MOST
EXCELLENT ON A SUNDAY THEN WE HAVE HIM THE WHOLE DAY AND HE IS QUIET
AND IN THE EVENING SO KIND
THIS OBSERVATION WAS NOT ALTOGETHER GROUNDLESS GOING TO CHURCH C
KEPT GRAHAM QUIET ON THE SUNDAY AND THE EVENING HE GENERALLY DEDICATED
TO A SERENE THOUGH RATHER INDOLENT SORT OF ENJOYMENT BY THE PARLOUR
FIRESIDE
HE WOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF THE COUCH AND THEN HE WOULD CALL
POLLY
GRAHAM WAS A BOY NOT QUITE AS OTHER BOYS ARE ALL HIS DELIGHT DID NOT
LIE IN ACTION HE WAS CAPABLE OF SOME INTERVALS OF CONTEMPLATION HE
COULD TAKE A PLEASURE TOO IN READING NOR WAS HIS SELECTION OF BOOKS
WHOLLY INDISCRIMINATE THERE WERE GLIMMERINGS OF CHARACTERISTIC
PREFERENCE AND EVEN OF INSTINCTIVE TASTE IN THE CHOICE
HE RARELY IT
IS TRUE REMARKED ON WHAT HE READ BUT I HAVE SEEN HIM SIT AND THINK OF
IT
POLLY BEING NEAR HIM KNEELING ON A LITTLE CUSHION OR THE CARPET A
CONVERSATION WOULD BEGIN IN MURMURS NOT INAUDIBLE THOUGH SUBDUED
I
CAUGHT A SNATCH OF THEIR TENOR NOW AND THEN AND IN TRUTH SOME
INFLUENCE BETTER AND FINER THAN THAT OF EVERY DAY SEEMED TO SOOTHE
GRAHAM AT SUCH TIMES INTO NO UNGENTLE MOOD
HAVE YOU LEARNED ANY HYMNS THIS WEEK POLLY
I HAVE LEARNED A VERY PRETTY ONE FOUR VERSES LONG
SHALL I SAY IT
SPEAK NICELY THEN DON'T BE IN A HURRY
THE HYMN BEING REHEARSED OR RATHER HALF CHANTED IN A LITTLE SINGING
VOICE GRAHAM WOULD TAKE EXCEPTIONS AT THE MANNER AND PROCEED TO GIVE
A LESSON IN RECITATION
SHE WAS QUICK IN LEARNING APT IN IMITATING
AND BESIDES HER PLEASURE WAS TO PLEASE GRAHAM SHE PROVED A READY
SCHOLAR
TO THE HYMN WOULD SUCCEED SOME READING PERHAPS A CHAPTER IN
THE BIBLE CORRECTION WAS SELDOM REQUIRED HERE FOR THE CHILD COULD
READ ANY SIMPLE NARRATIVE CHAPTER VERY WELL AND WHEN THE SUBJECT WAS
SUCH AS SHE COULD UNDERSTAND AND TAKE AN INTEREST IN HER EXPRESSION
AND EMPHASIS WERE SOMETHING REMARKABLE
JOSEPH CAST INTO THE PIT THE
CALLING OF SAMUEL DANIEL IN THE LIONS' DEN THESE WERE FAVOURITE
PASSAGES OF THE FIRST ESPECIALLY SHE SEEMED PERFECTLY TO FEEL THE
PATHOS
POOR JACOB SHE WOULD SOMETIMES SAY WITH QUIVERING LIPS
HOW HE
LOVED HIS SON JOSEPH AS MUCH SHE ONCE ADDED AS MUCH GRAHAM AS I
LOVE YOU IF YOU WERE TO DIE AND SHE RE OPENED THE BOOK SOUGHT THE
VERSE AND READ I SHOULD REFUSE TO BE COMFORTED AND GO DOWN INTO
THE GRAVE TO YOU MOURNING
WITH THESE WORDS SHE GATHERED GRAHAM IN HER LITTLE ARMS DRAWING HIS
LONG TRESSED HEAD TOWARDS HER
THE ACTION I REMEMBER STRUCK ME AS
STRANGELY RASH EXCITING THE FEELING ONE MIGHT EXPERIENCE ON SEEING AN
ANIMAL DANGEROUS BY NATURE AND BUT HALF TAMED BY ART TOO HEEDLESSLY
FONDLED
NOT THAT I FEARED GRAHAM WOULD HURT OR VERY ROUGHLY CHECK
HER BUT I THOUGHT SHE RAN RISK OF INCURRING SUCH A CARELESS IMPATIENT
REPULSE AS WOULD BE WORSE ALMOST TO HER THAN A BLOW
ON THE WHOLE
HOWEVER THESE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE BORNE PASSIVELY SOMETIMES EVEN A
SORT OF COMPLACENT WONDER AT HER EARNEST PARTIALITY WOULD SMILE NOT
UNKINDLY IN HIS EYES
ONCE HE SAID YOU LIKE ME ALMOST AS WELL AS IF
YOU WERE MY LITTLE SISTER POLLY
OH I DO LIKE YOU SAID SHE I DO LIKE YOU VERY MUCH
I WAS NOT LONG ALLOWED THE AMUSEMENT OF THIS STUDY OF CHARACTER
SHE
HAD SCARCELY BEEN AT BRETTON TWO MONTHS WHEN A LETTER CAME FROM MR
HOME SIGNIFYING THAT HE WAS NOW SETTLED AMONGST HIS MATERNAL KINSFOLK
ON THE CONTINENT THAT AS ENGLAND WAS BECOME WHOLLY DISTASTEFUL TO
HIM HE HAD NO THOUGHTS OF RETURNING HITHER PERHAPS FOR YEARS AND
THAT HE WISHED HIS LITTLE GIRL TO JOIN HIM IMMEDIATELY
I WONDER HOW SHE WILL TAKE THIS NEWS SAID MRS
BRETTON WHEN SHE HAD
READ THE LETTER
I WONDERED TOO AND I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO
COMMUNICATE IT
REPAIRING TO THE DRAWING ROOM IN WHICH CALM AND DECORATED APARTMENT
SHE WAS FOND OF BEING ALONE AND WHERE SHE COULD BE IMPLICITLY TRUSTED
FOR SHE FINGERED NOTHING OR RATHER SOILED NOTHING SHE FINGERED I
FOUND HER SEATED LIKE A LITTLE ODALISQUE ON A COUCH HALF SHADED BY
THE DROOPING DRAPERIES OF THE WINDOW NEAR
SHE SEEMED HAPPY ALL HER
APPLIANCES FOR OCCUPATION WERE ABOUT HER THE WHITE WOOD WORKBOX A
SHRED OR TWO OF MUSLIN AN END OR TWO OF RIBBON COLLECTED FOR
CONVERSION INTO DOLL MILLINERY
THE DOLL DULY NIGHT CAPPED AND
NIGHT GOWNED LAY IN ITS CRADLE SHE WAS ROCKING IT TO SLEEP WITH AN
AIR OF THE MOST PERFECT FAITH IN ITS POSSESSION OF SENTIENT AND
SOMNOLENT FACULTIES HER EYES AT THE SAME TIME BEING ENGAGED WITH A
PICTURE BOOK WHICH LAY OPEN ON HER LAP
MISS SNOWE SAID SHE IN A WHISPER THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK
CANDACE THE DOLL CHRISTENED BY GRAHAM FOR INDEED ITS BEGRIMED
COMPLEXION GAVE IT MUCH OF AN ETHIOPIAN ASPECT CANDACE IS ASLEEP
NOW AND I MAY TELL YOU ABOUT IT ONLY WE MUST BOTH SPEAK LOW LEST SHE
SHOULD WAKEN
THIS BOOK WAS GIVEN ME BY GRAHAM IT TELLS ABOUT DISTANT
COUNTRIES A LONG LONG WAY FROM ENGLAND WHICH NO TRAVELLER CAN REACH
WITHOUT SAILING THOUSANDS OF MILES OVER THE SEA
WILD MEN LIVE IN THESE
COUNTRIES MISS SNOWE WHO WEAR CLOTHES DIFFERENT FROM OURS INDEED
SOME OF THEM WEAR SCARCELY ANY CLOTHES FOR THE SAKE OF BEING COOL YOU
KNOW FOR THEY HAVE VERY HOT WEATHER
HERE IS A PICTURE OF THOUSANDS
GATHERED IN A DESOLATE PLACE A PLAIN SPREAD WITH SAND ROUND A MAN IN
BLACK A GOOD GOOD ENGLISHMAN A MISSIONARY WHO IS PREACHING TO
THEM UNDER A PALM TREE SHE SHOWED A LITTLE COLOURED CUT TO THAT
EFFECT AND HERE ARE PICTURES SHE WENT ON MORE STRANGER GRAMMAR
WAS OCCASIONALLY FORGOTTEN THAN THAT
THERE IS THE WONDERFUL GREAT
WALL OF CHINA HERE IS A CHINESE LADY WITH A FOOT LITTLER THAN MINE
THERE IS A WILD HORSE OF TARTARY AND HERE MOST STRANGE OF ALL IS A
LAND OF ICE AND SNOW WITHOUT GREEN FIELDS WOODS OR GARDENS
IN THIS
LAND THEY FOUND SOME MAMMOTH BONES THERE ARE NO MAMMOTHS NOW
YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS BUT I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE GRAHAM TOLD ME
A
MIGHTY GOBLIN CREATURE AS HIGH AS THIS ROOM AND AS LONG AS THE HALL
BUT NOT A FIERCE FLESH EATING THING GRAHAM THINKS
HE BELIEVES IF I
MET ONE IN A FOREST IT WOULD NOT KILL ME UNLESS I CAME QUITE IN ITS
WAY WHEN IT WOULD TRAMPLE ME DOWN AMONGST THE BUSHES AS I MIGHT TREAD
ON A GRASSHOPPER IN A HAYFIELD WITHOUT KNOWING IT
THUS SHE RAMBLED ON
POLLY I INTERRUPTED SHOULD YOU LIKE TO TRAVEL
NOT JUST YET WAS THE PRUDENT ANSWER BUT PERHAPS IN TWENTY YEARS
WHEN I AM GROWN A WOMAN AS TALL AS MRS
BRETTON I MAY TRAVEL WITH
GRAHAM
WE INTEND GOING TO SWITZERLAND AND CLIMBING MOUNT BLANCK AND
SOME DAY WE SHALL SAIL OVER TO SOUTH AMERICA AND WALK TO THE TOP OF
KIM KIM BORAZO
BUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRAVEL NOW IF YOUR PAPA WAS WITH YOU
HER REPLY NOT GIVEN TILL AFTER A PAUSE EVINCED ONE OF THOSE
UNEXPECTED TURNS OF TEMPER PECULIAR TO HER
WHERE IS THE GOOD OF TALKING IN THAT SILLY WAY SAID SHE
WHY DO YOU
MENTION PAPA WHAT IS PAPA TO YOU I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO BE HAPPY
AND NOT THINK ABOUT HIM SO MUCH AND THERE IT WILL BE ALL TO DO OVER
AGAIN
HER LIP TREMBLED
I HASTENED TO DISCLOSE THE FACT OF A LETTER HAVING
BEEN RECEIVED AND TO MENTION THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN THAT SHE AND HARRIET
SHOULD IMMEDIATELY REJOIN THIS DEAR PAPA
NOW POLLY ARE YOU NOT
GLAD I ADDED
SHE MADE NO ANSWER
SHE DROPPED HER BOOK AND CEASED TO ROCK HER DOLL
SHE GAZED AT ME WITH GRAVITY AND EARNESTNESS
SHALL NOT YOU LIKE TO GO TO PAPA
OF COURSE SHE SAID AT LAST IN THAT TRENCHANT MANNER SHE USUALLY
EMPLOYED IN SPEAKING TO ME AND WHICH WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT SHE
USED WITH MRS
BRETTON AND DIFFERENT AGAIN FROM THE ONE DEDICATED TO
GRAHAM
I WISHED TO ASCERTAIN MORE OF WHAT SHE THOUGHT BUT NO SHE
WOULD CONVERSE NO MORE
HASTENING TO MRS
BRETTON SHE QUESTIONED HER
AND RECEIVED THE CONFIRMATION OF MY NEWS
THE WEIGHT AND IMPORTANCE OF
THESE TIDINGS KEPT HER PERFECTLY SERIOUS THE WHOLE DAY
IN THE EVENING
AT THE MOMENT GRAHAM'S ENTRANCE WAS HEARD BELOW I FOUND HER AT MY
SIDE
SHE BEGAN TO ARRANGE A LOCKET RIBBON ABOUT MY NECK SHE DISPLACED
AND REPLACED THE COMB IN MY HAIR WHILE THUS BUSIED GRAHAM ENTERED
TELL HIM BY AND BY SHE WHISPERED TELL HIM I AM GOING
IN THE COURSE OF TEA TIME I MADE THE DESIRED COMMUNICATION
GRAHAM IT
CHANCED WAS AT THAT TIME GREATLY PREOCCUPIED ABOUT SOME SCHOOL PRIZE
FOR WHICH HE WAS COMPETING
THE NEWS HAD TO BE TOLD TWICE BEFORE IT
TOOK PROPER HOLD OF HIS ATTENTION AND EVEN THEN HE DWELT ON IT BUT
MOMENTLY
POLLY GOING WHAT A PITY DEAR LITTLE MOUSIE I SHALL BE SORRY TO LOSE
HER SHE MUST COME TO US AGAIN MAMMA
AND HASTILY SWALLOWING HIS TEA HE TOOK A CANDLE AND A SMALL TABLE TO
HIMSELF AND HIS BOOKS AND WAS SOON BURIED IN STUDY
LITTLE MOUSIE CREPT TO HIS SIDE AND LAY DOWN ON THE CARPET AT HIS
FEET HER FACE TO THE FLOOR MUTE AND MOTIONLESS SHE KEPT THAT POST AND
POSITION TILL BED TIME
ONCE I SAW GRAHAM WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF HER
PROXIMITY PUSH HER WITH HIS RESTLESS FOOT
SHE RECEDED AN INCH OR TWO
A MINUTE AFTER ONE LITTLE HAND STOLE OUT FROM BENEATH HER FACE TO
WHICH IT HAD BEEN PRESSED AND SOFTLY CARESSED THE HEEDLESS FOOT
WHEN
SUMMONED BY HER NURSE SHE ROSE AND DEPARTED VERY OBEDIENTLY HAVING BID
US ALL A SUBDUED GOOD NIGHT
I WILL NOT SAY THAT I DREADED GOING TO BED AN HOUR LATER YET I
CERTAINLY WENT WITH AN UNQUIET ANTICIPATION THAT I SHOULD FIND THAT
CHILD IN NO PEACEFUL SLEEP
THE FOREWARNING OF MY INSTINCT WAS BUT
FULFILLED WHEN I DISCOVERED HER ALL COLD AND VIGILANT PERCHED LIKE A
WHITE BIRD ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BED
I SCARCELY KNEW HOW TO ACCOST
HER SHE WAS NOT TO BE MANAGED LIKE ANOTHER CHILD
SHE HOWEVER
ACCOSTED ME
AS I CLOSED THE DOOR AND PUT THE LIGHT ON THE
DRESSING TABLE SHE TURNED TOME WITH THESE WORDS I CANNOT CANNOT
SLEEP AND IN THIS WAY I CANNOT CANNOT LIVE
I ASKED WHAT AILED HER
DEDFUL MIZ ER Y SAID SHE WITH HER PITEOUS LISP
SHALL I CALL MRS
BRETTON
THAT IS DOWNRIGHT SILLY WAS HER IMPATIENT REPLY AND INDEED I WELL
KNEW THAT IF SHE HAD HEARD MRS
BRETTON'S FOOT APPROACH SHE WOULD HAVE
NESTLED QUIET AS A MOUSE UNDER THE BEDCLOTHES
WHILST LAVISHING HER
ECCENTRICITIES REGARDLESSLY BEFORE ME FOR WHOM SHE PROFESSED SCARCELY
THE SEMBLANCE OF AFFECTION SHE NEVER SHOWED MY GODMOTHER ONE GLIMPSE
OF HER INNER SELF FOR HER SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A DOCILE SOMEWHAT
QUAINT LITTLE MAIDEN
I EXAMINED HER HER CHEEK WAS CRIMSON HER
DILATED EYE WAS BOTH TROUBLED AND GLOWING AND PAINFULLY RESTLESS IN
THIS STATE IT WAS OBVIOUS SHE MUST NOT BE LEFT TILL MORNING
I GUESSED
HOW THE CASE STOOD
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BID GRAHAM GOOD NIGHT AGAIN I ASKED
HE IS NOT
GONE TO HIS ROOM YET
SHE AT ONCE STRETCHED OUT HER LITTLE ARMS TO BE LIFTED
FOLDING A SHAWL
ROUND HER I CARRIED HER BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM
GRAHAM WAS JUST
COMING OUT
SHE CANNOT SLEEP WITHOUT SEEING AND SPEAKING TO YOU ONCE MORE I
SAID
SHE DOES NOT LIKE THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING YOU
I'VE SPOILT HER SAID HE TAKING HER FROM ME WITH GOOD HUMOUR AND
KISSING HER LITTLE HOT FACE AND BURNING LIPS
POLLY YOU CARE FOR ME
MORE THAN FOR PAPA NOW
I DO CARE FOR YOU BUT YOU CARE NOTHING FOR ME WAS HER WHISPER
SHE WAS ASSURED TO THE CONTRARY AGAIN KISSED RESTORED TO ME AND I
CARRIED HER AWAY BUT ALAS NOT SOOTHED
WHEN I THOUGHT SHE COULD LISTEN TO ME I SAID PAULINA YOU SHOULD NOT
GRIEVE THAT GRAHAM DOES NOT CARE FOR YOU SO MUCH AS YOU CARE FOR HIM
IT MUST BE SO
HER LIFTED AND QUESTIONING EYES ASKED WHY
BECAUSE HE IS A BOY AND YOU ARE A GIRL HE IS SIXTEEN AND YOU ARE ONLY
SIX HIS NATURE IS STRONG AND GAY AND YOURS IS OTHERWISE
BUT I LOVE HIM SO MUCH HE SHOULD LOVE ME A LITTLE
HE DOES
HE IS FOND OF YOU
YOU ARE HIS FAVOURITE
AM I GRAHAM'S FAVOURITE
YES MORE THAN ANY LITTLE CHILD I KNOW
THE ASSURANCE SOOTHED HER SHE SMILED IN HER ANGUISH
BUT I CONTINUED DON'T FRET AND DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH OF HIM OR
ELSE HE WILL FEEL YOU TO BE TROUBLESOME AND THEN IT IS ALL OVER
ALL OVER SHE ECHOED SOFTLY THEN I'LL BE GOOD
I'LL TRY TO BE GOOD
LUCY SNOWE
I PUT HER TO BED
WILL HE FORGIVE ME THIS ONE TIME SHE ASKED AS I UNDRESSED MYSELF
I
ASSURED HER THAT HE WOULD THAT AS YET HE WAS BY NO MEANS ALIENATED
THAT SHE HAD ONLY TO BE CAREFUL FOR THE FUTURE
THERE IS NO FUTURE SAID SHE I AM GOING
SHALL I EVER EVER SEE
HIM AGAIN AFTER I LEAVE ENGLAND
I RETURNED AN ENCOURAGING RESPONSE
THE CANDLE BEING EXTINGUISHED A
STILL HALF HOUR ELAPSED
I THOUGHT HER ASLEEP WHEN THE LITTLE WHITE
SHAPE ONCE MORE LIFTED ITSELF IN THE CRIB AND THE SMALL VOICE
ASKED DO YOU LIKE GRAHAM MISS SNOWE
LIKE HIM YES A LITTLE
ONLY A LITTLE DO YOU LIKE HIM AS I DO
I THINK NOT
NO NOT AS YOU DO
DO YOU LIKE HIM MUCH
I TOLD YOU I LIKED HIM A LITTLE
WHERE IS THE USE OF CARING FOR HIM SO
VERY MUCH HE IS FULL OF FAULTS
IS HE
ALL BOYS ARE
MORE THAN GIRLS
VERY LIKELY
WISE PEOPLE SAY IT IS FOLLY TO THINK ANYBODY PERFECT AND
AS TO LIKES AND DISLIKES WE SHOULD BE FRIENDLY TO ALL AND WORSHIP
NONE
ARE YOU A WISE PERSON
I MEAN TO TRY TO BE SO
GO TO SLEEP
I CANNOT GO TO SLEEP
HAVE YOU NO PAIN JUST HERE LAYING HER ELFISH
HAND ON HER ELFISH BREAST WHEN YOU THINK YOU SHALL HAVE TO LEAVE
GRAHAM FOR YOUR HOME IS NOT HERE
SURELY POLLY SAID I YOU SHOULD NOT FEEL SO MUCH PAIN WHEN YOU ARE
VERY SOON GOING TO REJOIN YOUR FATHER
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HIM DO YOU
NO LONGER WISH TO BE HIS LITTLE COMPANION
DEAD SILENCE SUCCEEDED THIS QUESTION
CHILD LIE DOWN AND SLEEP I URGED
MY BED IS COLD SAID SHE
I CAN'T WARM IT
I SAW THE LITTLE THING SHIVER
COME TO ME I SAID WISHING YET
SCARCELY HOPING THAT SHE WOULD COMPLY FOR SHE WAS A MOST STRANGE
CAPRICIOUS LITTLE CREATURE AND ESPECIALLY WHIMSICAL WITH ME
SHE
CAME HOWEVER INSTANTLY LIKE A SMALL GHOST GLIDING OVER THE CARPET
I
TOOK HER IN
SHE WAS CHILL I WARMED HER IN MY ARMS
SHE TREMBLED
NERVOUSLY I SOOTHED HER
THUS TRANQUILLIZED AND CHERISHED SHE AT LAST
SLUMBERED
A VERY UNIQUE CHILD THOUGHT I AS I VIEWED HER SLEEPING COUNTENANCE
BY THE FITFUL MOONLIGHT AND CAUTIOUSLY AND SOFTLY WIPED HER GLITTERING
EYELIDS AND HER WET CHEEKS WITH MY HANDKERCHIEF
HOW WILL SHE GET
THROUGH THIS WORLD OR BATTLE WITH THIS LIFE HOW WILL SHE BEAR THE
SHOCKS AND REPULSES THE HUMILIATIONS AND DESOLATIONS WHICH BOOKS AND
MY OWN REASON TELL ME ARE PREPARED FOR ALL FLESH
SHE DEPARTED THE NEXT DAY TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF WHEN SHE TOOK LEAVE
BUT EXERCISING SELF COMMAND
CHAPTER IV
MISS MARCHMONT
ON QUITTING BRETTON WHICH I DID A FEW WEEKS AFTER PAULINA'S
DEPARTURE LITTLE THINKING THEN I WAS NEVER AGAIN TO VISIT IT NEVER
MORE TO TREAD ITS CALM OLD STREETS I BETOOK MYSELF HOME HAVING BEEN
ABSENT SIX MONTHS
IT WILL BE CONJECTURED THAT I WAS OF COURSE GLAD TO
RETURN TO THE BOSOM OF MY KINDRED
WELL THE AMIABLE CONJECTURE DOES NO
HARM AND MAY THEREFORE BE SAFELY LEFT UNCONTRADICTED
FAR FROM SAYING
NAY INDEED I WILL PERMIT THE READER TO PICTURE ME FOR THE NEXT EIGHT
YEARS AS A BARK SLUMBERING THROUGH HALCYON WEATHER IN A HARBOUR STILL
AS GLASS THE STEERSMAN STRETCHED ON THE LITTLE DECK HIS FACE UP TO
HEAVEN HIS EYES CLOSED BURIED IF YOU WILL IN A LONG PRAYER
A GREAT
MANY WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE SUPPOSED TO PASS THEIR LIVES SOMETHING IN THAT
FASHION WHY NOT I WITH THE REST
PICTURE ME THEN IDLE BASKING PLUMP AND HAPPY STRETCHED ON A
CUSHIONED DECK WARMED WITH CONSTANT SUNSHINE ROCKED BY BREEZES
INDOLENTLY SOFT
HOWEVER IT CANNOT BE CONCEALED THAT IN THAT CASE I
MUST SOMEHOW HAVE FALLEN OVERBOARD OR THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN WRECK
AT LAST
I TOO WELL REMEMBER A TIME A LONG TIME OF COLD OF DANGER
OF CONTENTION
TO THIS HOUR WHEN I HAVE THE NIGHTMARE IT REPEATS THE
RUSH AND SALTNESS OF BRINY WAVES IN MY THROAT AND THEIR ICY PRESSURE
ON MY LUNGS
I EVEN KNOW THERE WAS A STORM AND THAT NOT OF ONE HOUR
NOR ONE DAY
FOR MANY DAYS AND NIGHTS NEITHER SUN NOR STARS APPEARED
WE CAST WITH OUR OWN HANDS THE TACKLING OUT OF THE SHIP A HEAVY
TEMPEST LAY ON US ALL HOPE THAT WE SHOULD BE SAVED WAS TAKEN AWAY
IN
FINE THE SHIP WAS LOST THE CREW PERISHED
AS FAR AS I RECOLLECT I COMPLAINED TO NO ONE ABOUT THESE TROUBLES
INDEED TO WHOM COULD I COMPLAIN OF MRS
BRETTON I HAD LONG LOST
SIGHT
IMPEDIMENTS RAISED BY OTHERS HAD YEARS AGO COME IN THE WAY
OF OUR INTERCOURSE AND CUT IT OFF
BESIDES TIME HAD BROUGHT CHANGES
FOR HER TOO THE HANDSOME PROPERTY OF WHICH SHE WAS LEFT GUARDIAN FOR
HER SON AND WHICH HAD BEEN CHIEFLY INVESTED IN SOME JOINT STOCK
UNDERTAKING HAD MELTED IT WAS SAID TO A FRACTION OF ITS ORIGINAL
AMOUNT
GRAHAM I LEARNED FROM INCIDENTAL RUMOURS HAD ADOPTED A
PROFESSION BOTH HE AND HIS MOTHER WERE GONE FROM BRETTON AND WERE
UNDERSTOOD TO BE NOW IN LONDON
THUS THERE REMAINED NO POSSIBILITY OF
DEPENDENCE ON OTHERS TO MYSELF ALONE COULD I LOOK
I KNOW NOT THAT I
WAS OF A SELF RELIANT OR ACTIVE NATURE BUT SELF RELIANCE AND EXERTION
WERE FORCED UPON ME BY CIRCUMSTANCES AS THEY ARE UPON THOUSANDS
BESIDES AND WHEN MISS MARCHMONT A MAIDEN LADY OF OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD
SENT FOR ME I OBEYED HER BEHEST IN THE HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT ASSIGN ME
SOME TASK I COULD UNDERTAKE
MISS MARCHMONT WAS A WOMAN OF FORTUNE AND LIVED IN A HANDSOME
RESIDENCE BUT SHE WAS A RHEUMATIC CRIPPLE IMPOTENT FOOT AND HAND
AND HAD BEEN SO FOR TWENTY YEARS
SHE ALWAYS SAT UPSTAIRS HER
DRAWING ROOM ADJOINED HER BED ROOM
I HAD OFTEN HEARD OF MISS
MARCHMONT AND OF HER PECULIARITIES SHE HAD THE CHARACTER OF BEING
VERY ECCENTRIC BUT TILL NOW HAD NEVER SEEN HER
I FOUND HER A
FURROWED GREY HAIRED WOMAN GRAVE WITH SOLITUDE STERN WITH LONG
AFFLICTION IRRITABLE ALSO AND PERHAPS EXACTING
IT SEEMED THAT A
MAID OR RATHER COMPANION WHO HAD WAITED ON HER FOR SOME YEARS WAS
ABOUT TO BE MARRIED AND SHE HEARING OF MY BEREAVED LOT HAD SENT FOR
ME WITH THE IDEA THAT I MIGHT SUPPLY THIS PERSON'S PLACE
SHE MADE THE
PROPOSAL TO ME AFTER TEA AS SHE AND I SAT ALONE BY HER FIRESIDE
IT WILL NOT BE AN EASY LIFE SAID SHE CANDIDLY FOR I REQUIRE A GOOD
DEAL OF ATTENTION AND YOU WILL BE MUCH CONFINED YET PERHAPS
CONTRASTED WITH THE EXISTENCE YOU HAVE LATELY LED IT MAY APPEAR
TOLERABLE
I REFLECTED
OF COURSE IT OUGHT TO APPEAR TOLERABLE I ARGUED INWARDLY
BUT SOMEHOW BY SOME STRANGE FATALITY IT WOULD NOT
TO LIVE HERE IN
THIS CLOSE ROOM THE WATCHER OF SUFFERING SOMETIMES PERHAPS THE BUTT
OF TEMPER THROUGH ALL THAT WAS TO COME OF MY YOUTH WHILE ALL THAT WAS
GONE HAD PASSED TO SAY THE LEAST NOT BLISSFULLY MY HEART SUNK ONE
MOMENT THEN IT REVIVED FOR THOUGH I FORCED MYSELF TO REALISE EVILS
I THINK I WAS TOO PROSAIC TO IDEALISE AND CONSEQUENTLY TO EXAGGERATE
THEM
MY DOUBT IS WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE STRENGTH FOR THE UNDERTAKING I
OBSERVED
THAT IS MY OWN SCRUPLE SAID SHE FOR YOU LOOK A WORN OUT CREATURE
SO I DID
I SAW MYSELF IN THE GLASS IN MY MOURNING DRESS A FADED
HOLLOW EYED VISION
YET I THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE WAN SPECTACLE
THE
BLIGHT I BELIEVED WAS CHIEFLY EXTERNAL I STILL FELT LIFE AT LIFE'S
SOURCES
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU IN VIEW ANYTHING
NOTHING CLEAR AS YET BUT I MAY FIND SOMETHING
SO YOU IMAGINE PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT
TRY YOUR OWN METHOD THEN AND
IF IT DOES NOT SUCCEED TEST MINE
THE CHANCE I HAVE OFFERED SHALL BE
LEFT OPEN TO YOU FOR THREE MONTHS
THIS WAS KIND
I TOLD HER SO AND EXPRESSED MY GRATITUDE
WHILE I WAS
SPEAKING A PAROXYSM OF PAIN CAME ON
I MINISTERED TO HER MADE THE
NECESSARY APPLICATIONS ACCORDING TO HER DIRECTIONS AND BY THE TIME
SHE WAS RELIEVED A SORT OF INTIMACY WAS ALREADY FORMED BETWEEN US
I
FOR MY PART HAD LEARNED FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE BORE THIS ATTACK
THAT SHE WAS A FIRM PATIENT WOMAN PATIENT UNDER PHYSICAL PAIN THOUGH
SOMETIMES PERHAPS EXCITABLE UNDER LONG MENTAL CANKER AND SHE FROM
THE GOOD WILL WITH WHICH I SUCCOURED HER DISCOVERED THAT SHE COULD
INFLUENCE MY SYMPATHIES SUCH AS THEY WERE
SHE SENT FOR ME THE NEXT
DAY FOR FIVE OR SIX SUCCESSIVE DAYS SHE CLAIMED MY COMPANY
CLOSER
ACQUAINTANCE WHILE IT DEVELOPED BOTH FAULTS AND ECCENTRICITIES
OPENED AT THE SAME TIME A VIEW OF A CHARACTER I COULD RESPECT
STERN
AND EVEN MOROSE AS SHE SOMETIMES WAS I COULD WAIT ON HER AND SIT
BESIDE HER WITH THAT CALM WHICH ALWAYS BLESSES US WHEN WE ARE SENSIBLE
THAT OUR MANNERS PRESENCE CONTACT PLEASE AND SOOTHE THE PERSONS WE
SERVE
EVEN WHEN SHE SCOLDED ME WHICH SHE DID NOW AND THEN VERY
TARTLY IT WAS IN SUCH A WAY AS DID NOT HUMILIATE AND LEFT NO STING
IT WAS RATHER LIKE AN IRASCIBLE MOTHER RATING HER DAUGHTER THAN A
HARSH MISTRESS LECTURING A DEPENDANT LECTURE INDEED SHE COULD NOT
THOUGH SHE COULD OCCASIONALLY STORM
MOREOVER A VEIN OF REASON EVER
RAN THROUGH HER PASSION SHE WAS LOGICAL EVEN WHEN FIERCE
ERE LONG A
GROWING SENSE OF ATTACHMENT BEGAN TO PRESENT THE THOUGHT OF STAYING
WITH HER AS COMPANION IN QUITE A NEW LIGHT IN ANOTHER WEEK I HAD
AGREED TO REMAIN
TWO HOT CLOSE ROOMS THUS BECAME MY WORLD AND A CRIPPLED OLD WOMAN MY
MISTRESS MY FRIEND MY ALL
HER SERVICE WAS MY DUTY HER PAIN MY
SUFFERING HER RELIEF MY HOPE HER ANGER MY PUNISHMENT HER REGARD
MY REWARD
I FORGOT THAT THERE WERE FIELDS WOODS RIVERS SEAS AN
EVER CHANGING SKY OUTSIDE THE STEAM DIMMED LATTICE OF THIS SICK
CHAMBER I WAS ALMOST CONTENT TO FORGET IT
ALL WITHIN ME BECAME
NARROWED TO MY LOT
TAME AND STILL BY HABIT DISCIPLINED BY DESTINY I
DEMANDED NO WALKS IN THE FRESH AIR MY APPETITE NEEDED NO MORE THAN THE
TINY MESSES SERVED FOR THE INVALID
IN ADDITION SHE GAVE ME THE
ORIGINALITY OF HER CHARACTER TO STUDY THE STEADINESS OF HER VIRTUES I
WILL ADD THE POWER OF HER PASSIONS TO ADMIRE THE TRUTH OF HER
FEELINGS TO TRUST
ALL THESE THINGS SHE HAD AND FOR THESE THINGS I
CLUNG TO HER
FOR THESE THINGS I WOULD HAVE CRAWLED ON WITH HER FOR TWENTY YEARS IF
FOR TWENTY YEARS LONGER HER LIFE OF ENDURANCE HAD BEEN PROTRACTED
BUT
ANOTHER DECREE WAS WRITTEN
IT SEEMED I MUST BE STIMULATED INTO ACTION
I MUST BE GOADED DRIVEN STUNG FORCED TO ENERGY
MY LITTLE MORSEL OF
HUMAN AFFECTION WHICH I PRIZED AS IF IT WERE A SOLID PEARL MUST MELT
IN MY FINGERS AND SLIP THENCE LIKE A DISSOLVING HAILSTONE
MY SMALL
ADOPTED DUTY MUST BE SNATCHED FROM MY EASILY CONTENTED CONSCIENCE
I
HAD WANTED TO COMPROMISE WITH FATE TO ESCAPE OCCASIONAL GREAT AGONIES
BY SUBMITTING TO A WHOLE LIFE OF PRIVATION AND SMALL PAINS
FATE WOULD
NOT SO BE PACIFIED NOR WOULD PROVIDENCE SANCTION THIS SHRINKING SLOTH
AND COWARDLY INDOLENCE
ONE FEBRUARY NIGHT I REMEMBER IT WELL THERE CAME A VOICE NEAR MISS
MARCHMONT'S HOUSE HEARD BY EVERY INMATE BUT TRANSLATED PERHAPS ONLY
BY ONE
AFTER A CALM WINTER STORMS WERE USHERING IN THE SPRING
I HAD
PUT MISS MARCHMONT TO BED I SAT AT THE FIRESIDE SEWING
THE WIND WAS
WAILING AT THE WINDOWS IT HAD WAILED ALL DAY BUT AS NIGHT DEEPENED
IT TOOK A NEW TONE AN ACCENT KEEN PIERCING ALMOST ARTICULATE TO THE
EAR A PLAINT PITEOUS AND DISCONSOLATE TO THE NERVES TRILLED IN EVERY
GUST
OH HUSH HUSH I SAID IN MY DISTURBED MIND DROPPING MY WORK AND
MAKING A VAIN EFFORT TO STOP MY EARS AGAINST THAT SUBTLE SEARCHING
CRY
I HAD HEARD THAT VERY VOICE ERE THIS AND COMPULSORY OBSERVATION
HAD FORCED ON ME A THEORY AS TO WHAT IT BODED
THREE TIMES IN THE
COURSE OF MY LIFE EVENTS HAD TAUGHT ME THAT THESE STRANGE ACCENTS IN
THE STORM THIS RESTLESS HOPELESS CRY DENOTE A COMING STATE OF THE
ATMOSPHERE UNPROPITIOUS TO LIFE
EPIDEMIC DISEASES I BELIEVED WERE
OFTEN HERALDED BY A GASPING SOBBING TORMENTED LONG LAMENTING EAST
WIND
HENCE I INFERRED AROSE THE LEGEND OF THE BANSHEE
I FANCIED
TOO I HAD NOTICED BUT WAS NOT PHILOSOPHER ENOUGH TO KNOW WHETHER
THERE WAS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE OFTEN AT
THE SAME TIME HEAR OF DISTURBED VOLCANIC ACTION IN DISTANT PARTS OF THE
WORLD OF RIVERS SUDDENLY RUSHING ABOVE THEIR BANKS AND OF STRANGE
HIGH TIDES FLOWING FURIOUSLY IN ON LOW SEA COASTS
OUR GLOBE I HAD
SAID TO MYSELF SEEMS AT SUCH PERIODS TORN AND DISORDERED THE FEEBLE
AMONGST US WITHER IN HER DISTEMPERED BREATH RUSHING HOT FROM STEAMING
VOLCANOES
I LISTENED AND TREMBLED MISS MARCHMONT SLEPT
ABOUT MIDNIGHT THE STORM IN ONE HALF HOUR FELL TO A DEAD CALM
THE
FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN BURNING DEAD GLOWED UP VIVIDLY
I FELT THE AIR
CHANGE AND BECOME KEEN
RAISING BLIND AND CURTAIN I LOOKED OUT AND
SAW IN THE STARS THE KEEN SPARKLE OF A SHARP FROST
TURNING AWAY THE OBJECT THAT MET MY EYES WAS MISS MARCHMONT AWAKE
LIFTING HER HEAD FROM THE PILLOW AND REGARDING ME WITH UNUSUAL
EARNESTNESS
IS IT A FINE NIGHT SHE ASKED
I REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
I THOUGHT SO SHE SAID FOR I FEEL SO STRONG SO WELL
RAISE ME
I
FEEL YOUNG TO NIGHT SHE CONTINUED YOUNG LIGHT HEARTED AND HAPPY
WHAT IF MY COMPLAINT BE ABOUT TO TAKE A TURN AND I AM YET DESTINED TO
ENJOY HEALTH IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE
AND THESE ARE NOT THE DAYS OF MIRACLES I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND
WONDERED TO HEAR HER TALK SO
SHE WENT ON DIRECTING HER CONVERSATION TO
THE PAST AND SEEMING TO RECALL ITS INCIDENTS SCENES AND PERSONAGES
WITH SINGULAR VIVIDNESS
I LOVE MEMORY TO NIGHT SHE SAID I PRIZE HER AS MY BEST FRIEND
SHE
IS JUST NOW GIVING ME A DEEP DELIGHT SHE IS BRINGING BACK TO MY HEART
IN WARM AND BEAUTIFUL LIFE REALITIES NOT MERE EMPTY IDEAS BUT WHAT
WERE ONCE REALITIES AND THAT I LONG HAVE THOUGHT DECAYED DISSOLVED
MIXED IN WITH GRAVE MOULD
I POSSESS JUST NOW THE HOURS THE THOUGHTS
THE HOPES OF MY YOUTH
I RENEW THE LOVE OF MY LIFE ITS ONLY
LOVE ALMOST ITS ONLY AFFECTION FOR I AM NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD
WOMAN I AM NOT AMIABLE
YET I HAVE HAD MY FEELINGS STRONG AND
CONCENTRATED AND THESE FEELINGS HAD THEIR OBJECT WHICH IN ITS SINGLE
SELF WAS DEAR TO ME AS TO THE MAJORITY OF MEN AND WOMEN ARE ALL THE
UNNUMBERED POINTS ON WHICH THEY DISSIPATE THEIR REGARD
WHILE I LOVED
AND WHILE I WAS LOVED WHAT AN EXISTENCE I ENJOYED WHAT A GLORIOUS
YEAR I CAN RECALL HOW BRIGHT IT COMES BACK TO ME WHAT A LIVING
SPRING WHAT A WARM GLAD SUMMER WHAT SOFT MOONLIGHT SILVERING THE
AUTUMN EVENINGS WHAT STRENGTH OF HOPE UNDER THE ICE BOUND WATERS AND
FROST HOAR FIELDS OF THAT YEAR'S WINTER THROUGH THAT YEAR MY HEART
LIVED WITH FRANK'S HEART
O MY NOBLE FRANK MY FAITHFUL FRANK MY
GOOD FRANK SO MUCH BETTER THAN MYSELF HIS STANDARD IN ALL THINGS SO
MUCH HIGHER THIS I CAN NOW SEE AND SAY IF FEW WOMEN HAVE SUFFERED AS
I DID IN HIS LOSS FEW HAVE ENJOYED WHAT I DID IN HIS LOVE
IT WAS A
FAR BETTER KIND OF LOVE THAN COMMON I HAD NO DOUBTS ABOUT IT OR HIM
IT WAS SUCH A LOVE AS HONOURED PROTECTED AND ELEVATED NO LESS THAN
IT GLADDENED HER TO WHOM IT WAS GIVEN
LET ME NOW ASK JUST AT THIS
MOMENT WHEN MY MIND IS SO STRANGELY CLEAR LET ME REFLECT WHY IT WAS
TAKEN FROM ME FOR WHAT CRIME WAS I CONDEMNED AFTER TWELVE MONTHS OF
BLISS TO UNDERGO THIRTY YEARS OF SORROW
I DO NOT KNOW SHE CONTINUED AFTER A PAUSE I CANNOT CANNOT SEE
THE REASON YET AT THIS HOUR I CAN SAY WITH SINCERITY WHAT I NEVER
TRIED TO SAY BEFORE INSCRUTABLE GOD THY WILL BE DONE AND AT THIS
MOMENT I CAN BELIEVE THAT DEATH WILL RESTORE ME TO FRANK
I NEVER
BELIEVED IT TILL NOW
HE IS DEAD THEN I INQUIRED IN A LOW VOICE
MY DEAR GIRL SHE SAID ONE HAPPY CHRISTMAS EVE I DRESSED AND
DECORATED MYSELF EXPECTING MY LOVER VERY SOON TO BE MY HUSBAND WOULD
COME THAT NIGHT TO VISIT ME
I SAT DOWN TO WAIT
ONCE MORE I SEE THAT
MOMENT I SEE THE SNOW TWILIGHT STEALING THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER WHICH
THE CURTAIN WAS NOT DROPPED FOR I DESIGNED TO WATCH HIM RIDE UP THE
WHITE WALK I SEE AND FEEL THE SOFT FIRELIGHT WARMING ME PLAYING ON MY
SILK DRESS AND FITFULLY SHOWING ME MY OWN YOUNG FIGURE IN A GLASS
I
SEE THE MOON OF A CALM WINTER NIGHT FLOAT FULL CLEAR AND COLD OVER
THE INKY MASS OF SHRUBBERY AND THE SILVERED TURF OF MY GROUNDS
I
WAIT WITH SOME IMPATIENCE IN MY PULSE BUT NO DOUBT IN MY BREAST
THE
FLAMES HAD DIED IN THE FIRE BUT IT WAS A BRIGHT MASS YET THE MOON WAS
MOUNTING HIGH BUT SHE WAS STILL VISIBLE FROM THE LATTICE THE CLOCK
NEARED TEN HE RARELY TARRIED LATER THAN THIS BUT ONCE OR TWICE HE HAD
BEEN DELAYED SO LONG
WOULD HE FOR ONCE FAIL ME NO NOT EVEN FOR ONCE AND NOW HE WAS
COMING AND COMING FAST TO ATONE FOR LOST TIME
'FRANK YOU FURIOUS
RIDER I SAID INWARDLY LISTENING GLADLY YET ANXIOUSLY TO HIS
APPROACHING GALLOP 'YOU SHALL BE REBUKED FOR THIS I WILL TELL YOU IT
IS MY NECK YOU ARE PUTTING IN PERIL FOR WHATEVER IS YOURS IS IN A
DEARER AND TENDERER SENSE MINE THERE HE WAS I SAW HIM BUT I THINK
TEARS WERE IN MY EYES MY SIGHT WAS SO CONFUSED
I SAW THE HORSE I
HEARD IT STAMP I SAW AT LEAST A MASS I HEARD A CLAMOUR
WAS IT A
HORSE OR WHAT HEAVY DRAGGING THING WAS IT CROSSING STRANGELY DARK
THE LAWN
HOW COULD I NAME THAT THING IN THE MOONLIGHT BEFORE ME OR
HOW COULD I UTTER THE FEELING WHICH ROSE IN MY SOUL
I COULD ONLY RUN OUT
A GREAT ANIMAL TRULY FRANK'S BLACK
HORSE STOOD TREMBLING PANTING SNORTING BEFORE THE DOOR A MAN HELD
IT FRANK AS I THOUGHT
'WHAT IS THE MATTER I DEMANDED
THOMAS MY OWN SERVANT ANSWERED BY
SAYING SHARPLY 'GO INTO THE HOUSE MADAM AND THEN CALLING TO ANOTHER
SERVANT WHO CAME HURRYING FROM THE KITCHEN AS IF SUMMONED BY SOME
INSTINCT 'RUTH TAKE MISSIS INTO THE HOUSE DIRECTLY BUT I WAS
KNEELING DOWN IN THE SNOW BESIDE SOMETHING THAT LAY THERE SOMETHING
THAT I HAD SEEN DRAGGED ALONG THE GROUND SOMETHING THAT SIGHED THAT
GROANED ON MY BREAST AS I LIFTED AND DREW IT TO ME
HE WAS NOT DEAD
HE WAS NOT QUITE UNCONSCIOUS
I HAD HIM CARRIED IN I REFUSED TO BE
ORDERED ABOUT AND THRUST FROM HIM
I WAS QUITE COLLECTED ENOUGH NOT
ONLY TO BE MY OWN MISTRESS BUT THE MISTRESS OF OTHERS
THEY HAD BEGUN
BY TRYING TO TREAT ME LIKE A CHILD AS THEY ALWAYS DO WITH PEOPLE
STRUCK BY GOD'S HAND BUT I GAVE PLACE TO NONE EXCEPT THE SURGEON AND
WHEN HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD I TOOK MY DYING FRANK TO MYSELF
HE HAD
STRENGTH TO FOLD ME IN HIS ARMS HE HAD POWER TO SPEAK MY NAME HE
HEARD ME AS I PRAYED OVER HIM VERY SOFTLY HE FELT ME AS I TENDERLY AND
FONDLY COMFORTED HIM
'MARIA HE SAID 'I AM DYING IN PARADISE HE SPENT HIS LAST BREATH
IN FAITHFUL WORDS FOR ME
WHEN THE DAWN OF CHRISTMAS MORNING BROKE MY
FRANK WAS WITH GOD
AND THAT SHE WENT ON HAPPENED THIRTY YEARS AGO
I HAVE SUFFERED
SINCE
I DOUBT IF I HAVE MADE THE BEST USE OF ALL MY CALAMITIES
SOFT
AMIABLE NATURES THEY WOULD HAVE REFINED TO SAINTLINESS OF STRONG EVIL
SPIRITS THEY WOULD HAVE MADE DEMONS AS FOR ME I HAVE ONLY BEEN A
WOE STRUCK AND SELFISH WOMAN
YOU HAVE DONE MUCH GOOD I SAID FOR SHE WAS NOTED FOR HER LIBERAL
ALMSGIVING
I HAVE NOT WITHHELD MONEY YOU MEAN WHERE IT COULD ASSUAGE
AFFLICTION
WHAT OF THAT IT COST ME NO EFFORT OR PANG TO GIVE
BUT I
THINK FROM THIS DAY I AM ABOUT TO ENTER A BETTER FRAME OF MIND TO
PREPARE MYSELF FOR REUNION WITH FRANK
YOU SEE I STILL THINK OF FRANK
MORE THAN OF GOD AND UNLESS IT BE COUNTED THAT IN THUS LOVING THE
CREATURE SO MUCH SO LONG AND SO EXCLUSIVELY I HAVE NOT AT LEAST
BLASPHEMED THE CREATOR SMALL IS MY CHANCE OF SALVATION
WHAT DO YOU
THINK LUCY OF THESE THINGS BE MY CHAPLAIN AND TELL ME
THIS QUESTION I COULD NOT ANSWER I HAD NO WORDS
IT SEEMED AS IF SHE
THOUGHT I HAD ANSWERED IT
VERY RIGHT MY CHILD
WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE GOD MERCIFUL BUT NOT
ALWAYS FOR US COMPREHENSIBLE
WE SHOULD ACCEPT OUR OWN LOT WHATEVER IT
BE AND TRY TO RENDER HAPPY THAT OF OTHERS
SHOULD WE NOT WELL
TO MORROW I WILL BEGIN BY TRYING TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO
DO SOMETHING FOR YOU LUCY SOMETHING THAT WILL BENEFIT YOU WHEN I AM
DEAD
MY HEAD ACHES NOW WITH TALKING TOO MUCH STILL I AM HAPPY
GO TO
BED
THE CLOCK STRIKES TWO
HOW LATE YOU SIT UP OR RATHER HOW LATE I
IN MY SELFISHNESS KEEP YOU UP
BUT GO NOW HAVE NO MORE ANXIETY FOR
ME I FEEL I SHALL REST WELL
SHE COMPOSED HERSELF AS IF TO SLUMBER
I TOO RETIRED TO MY CRIB IN A
CLOSET WITHIN HER ROOM
THE NIGHT PASSED IN QUIETNESS QUIETLY HER DOOM
MUST AT LAST HAVE COME PEACEFULLY AND PAINLESSLY IN THE MORNING SHE
WAS FOUND WITHOUT LIFE NEARLY COLD BUT ALL CALM AND UNDISTURBED
HER
PREVIOUS EXCITEMENT OF SPIRITS AND CHANGE OF MOOD HAD BEEN THE PRELUDE
OF A FIT ONE STROKE SUFFICED TO SEVER THE THREAD OF AN EXISTENCE SO
LONG FRETTED BY AFFLICTION
CHAPTER V
TURNING A NEW LEAF
MY MISTRESS BEING DEAD AND I ONCE MORE ALONE I HAD TO LOOK OUT FOR A
NEW PLACE
ABOUT THIS TIME I MIGHT BE A LITTLE A VERY LITTLE SHAKEN
IN NERVES
I GRANT I WAS NOT LOOKING WELL BUT ON THE CONTRARY THIN
HAGGARD AND HOLLOW EYED LIKE A SITTER UP AT NIGHT LIKE AN
OVERWROUGHT SERVANT OR A PLACELESS PERSON IN DEBT
IN DEBT HOWEVER I
WAS NOT NOR QUITE POOR FOR THOUGH MISS MARCHMONT HAD NOT HAD TIME TO
BENEFIT ME AS ON THAT LAST NIGHT SHE SAID SHE INTENDED YET AFTER
THE FUNERAL MY WAGES WERE DULY PAID BY HER SECOND COUSIN THE HEIR AN
AVARICIOUS LOOKING MAN WITH PINCHED NOSE AND NARROW TEMPLES WHO
INDEED I HEARD LONG AFTERWARDS TURNED OUT A THOROUGH MISER A DIRECT
CONTRAST TO HIS GENEROUS KINSWOMAN AND A FOIL TO HER MEMORY BLESSED
TO THIS DAY BY THE POOR AND NEEDY
THE POSSESSOR THEN OF FIFTEEN
POUNDS OF HEALTH THOUGH WORN NOT BROKEN AND OF A SPIRIT IN SIMILAR
CONDITION I MIGHT STILL IN COMPARISON WITH MANY PEOPLE BE REGARDED
AS OCCUPYING AN ENVIABLE POSITION
AN EMBARRASSING ONE IT WAS HOWEVER
AT THE SAME TIME AS I FELT WITH SOME ACUTENESS ON A CERTAIN DAY OF
WHICH THE CORRESPONDING ONE IN THE NEXT WEEK WAS TO SEE MY DEPARTURE
FROM MY PRESENT ABODE WHILE WITH ANOTHER I WAS NOT PROVIDED
IN THIS DILEMMA I WENT AS A LAST AND SOLE RESOURCE TO SEE AND CONSULT
AN OLD SERVANT OF OUR FAMILY ONCE MY NURSE NOW HOUSEKEEPER AT A GRAND
MANSION NOT FAR FROM MISS MARCHMONT'S
I SPENT SOME HOURS WITH HER SHE
COMFORTED BUT KNEW NOT HOW TO ADVISE ME
STILL ALL INWARD DARKNESS I
LEFT HER ABOUT TWILIGHT A WALK OF TWO MILES LAY BEFORE ME IT WAS A
CLEAR FROSTY NIGHT
IN SPITE OF MY SOLITUDE MY POVERTY AND MY
PERPLEXITY MY HEART NOURISHED AND NERVED WITH THE VIGOUR OF A YOUTH
THAT HAD NOT YET COUNTED TWENTY THREE SUMMERS BEAT LIGHT AND NOT
FEEBLY
NOT FEEBLY I AM SURE OR I SHOULD HAVE TREMBLED IN THAT LONELY
WALK WHICH LAY THROUGH STILL FIELDS AND PASSED NEITHER VILLAGE NOR
FARMHOUSE NOR COTTAGE I SHOULD HAVE QUAILED IN THE ABSENCE OF
MOONLIGHT FOR IT WAS BY THE LEADING OF STARS ONLY I TRACED THE DIM
PATH I SHOULD HAVE QUAILED STILL MORE IN THE UNWONTED PRESENCE OF THAT
WHICH TO NIGHT SHONE IN THE NORTH A MOVING MYSTERY THE AURORA
BOREALIS
BUT THIS SOLEMN STRANGER INFLUENCED ME OTHERWISE THAN THROUGH
MY FEARS
SOME NEW POWER IT SEEMED TO BRING
I DREW IN ENERGY WITH THE
KEEN LOW BREEZE THAT BLEW ON ITS PATH
A BOLD THOUGHT WAS SENT TO MY
MIND MY MIND WAS MADE STRONG TO RECEIVE IT
LEAVE THIS WILDERNESS IT WAS SAID TO ME AND GO OUT HENCE
WHERE WAS THE QUERY
I HAD NOT VERY FAR TO LOOK GAZING FROM THIS COUNTRY PARISH IN THAT
FLAT RICH MIDDLE OF ENGLAND I MENTALLY SAW WITHIN REACH WHAT I HAD
NEVER YET BEHELD WITH MY BODILY EYES I SAW LONDON
THE NEXT DAY I RETURNED TO THE HALL AND ASKING ONCE MORE TO SEE THE
HOUSEKEEPER I COMMUNICATED TO HER MY PLAN
MRS
BARRETT WAS A GRAVE JUDICIOUS WOMAN THOUGH SHE KNEW LITTLE MORE
OF THE WORLD THAN MYSELF BUT GRAVE AND JUDICIOUS AS SHE WAS SHE DID
NOT CHARGE ME WITH BEING OUT OF MY SENSES AND INDEED I HAD A STAID
MANNER OF MY OWN WHICH ERE NOW HAD BEEN AS GOOD TO ME AS CLOAK AND HOOD
OF HODDEN GREY SINCE UNDER ITS FAVOUR I HAD BEEN ENABLED TO ACHIEVE
WITH IMPUNITY AND EVEN APPROBATION DEEDS THAT IF ATTEMPTED WITH AN
EXCITED AND UNSETTLED AIR WOULD IN SOME MINDS HAVE STAMPED ME AS A
DREAMER AND ZEALOT
THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS SLOWLY PROPOUNDING SOME DIFFICULTIES WHILE SHE
PREPARED ORANGE RIND FOR MARMALADE WHEN A CHILD RAN PAST THE WINDOW
AND CAME BOUNDING INTO THE ROOM
IT WAS A PRETTY CHILD AND AS IT
DANCED LAUGHING UP TO ME FOR WE WERE NOT STRANGERS NOR INDEED WAS
ITS MOTHER A YOUNG MARRIED DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE A STRANGER I TOOK
IT ON MY KNEE
DIFFERENT AS WERE OUR SOCIAL POSITIONS NOW THIS CHILD'S MOTHER AND I
HAD BEEN SCHOOLFELLOWS WHEN I WAS A GIRL OF TEN AND SHE A YOUNG LADY
OF SIXTEEN AND I REMEMBERED HER GOOD LOOKING BUT DULL IN A LOWER
CLASS THAN MINE
I WAS ADMIRING THE BOY'S HANDSOME DARK EYES WHEN THE MOTHER YOUNG
MRS
LEIGH ENTERED
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL AND KIND LOOKING WOMAN WAS THE
GOOD NATURED AND COMELY BUT UNINTELLECTUAL GIRL BECOME WIFEHOOD AND
MATERNITY HAD CHANGED HER THUS AS I HAVE SINCE SEEN THEM CHANGE OTHERS
EVEN LESS PROMISING THAN SHE
ME SHE HAD FORGOTTEN
I WAS CHANGED TOO
THOUGH NOT I FEAR FOR THE BETTER
I MADE NO ATTEMPT TO RECALL MYSELF
TO HER MEMORY WHY SHOULD I SHE CAME FOR HER SON TO ACCOMPANY HER IN A
WALK AND BEHIND HER FOLLOWED A NURSE CARRYING AN INFANT
I ONLY
MENTION THE INCIDENT BECAUSE IN ADDRESSING THE NURSE MRS
LEIGH SPOKE
FRENCH VERY BAD FRENCH BY THE WAY AND WITH AN INCORRIGIBLY BAD
ACCENT AGAIN FORCIBLY REMINDING ME OF OUR SCHOOL DAYS AND I FOUND
THE WOMAN WAS A FOREIGNER
THE LITTLE BOY CHATTERED VOLUBLY IN FRENCH
TOO
WHEN THE WHOLE PARTY WERE WITHDRAWN MRS
BARRETT REMARKED THAT
HER YOUNG LADY HAD BROUGHT THAT FOREIGN NURSE HOME WITH HER TWO YEARS
AGO ON HER RETURN FROM A CONTINENTAL EXCURSION THAT SHE WAS TREATED
ALMOST AS WELL AS A GOVERNESS AND HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT WALK OUT WITH
THE BABY AND CHATTER FRENCH WITH MASTER CHARLES AND ADDED MRS
BARRETT SHE SAYS THERE ARE MANY ENGLISHWOMEN IN FOREIGN FAMILIES AS
WELL PLACED AS SHE
I STORED UP THIS PIECE OF CASUAL INFORMATION AS CAREFUL HOUSEWIVES
STORE SEEMINGLY WORTHLESS SHREDS AND FRAGMENTS FOR WHICH THEIR
PRESCIENT MINDS ANTICIPATE A POSSIBLE USE SOME DAY
BEFORE I LEFT MY
OLD FRIEND SHE GAVE ME THE ADDRESS OF A RESPECTABLE OLD FASHIONED INN
IN THE CITY WHICH SHE SAID MY UNCLES USED TO FREQUENT IN FORMER DAYS
IN GOING TO LONDON I RAN LESS RISK AND EVINCED LESS ENTERPRISE THAN
THE READER MAY THINK
IN FACT THE DISTANCE WAS ONLY FIFTY MILES
MY
MEANS WOULD SUFFICE BOTH TO TAKE ME THERE TO KEEP ME A FEW DAYS AND
ALSO TO BRING ME BACK IF I FOUND NO INDUCEMENT TO STAY
I REGARDED IT
AS A BRIEF HOLIDAY PERMITTED FOR ONCE TO WORK WEARY FACULTIES RATHER
THAN AS AN ADVENTURE OF LIFE AND DEATH
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE TAKING
ALL YOU DO AT A MODERATE ESTIMATE IT KEEPS MIND AND BODY TRANQUIL
WHEREAS GRANDILOQUENT NOTIONS ARE APT TO HURRY BOTH INTO FEVER
FIFTY MILES WERE THEN A DAY'S JOURNEY FOR I SPEAK OF A TIME GONE BY
MY HAIR WHICH TILL A LATE PERIOD WITHSTOOD THE FROSTS OF TIME LIES
NOW AT LAST WHITE UNDER A WHITE CAP LIKE SNOW BENEATH SNOW
ABOUT
NINE O'CLOCK OF A WET FEBRUARY NIGHT I REACHED LONDON
MY READER I KNOW IS ONE WHO WOULD NOT THANK ME FOR AN ELABORATE
REPRODUCTION OF POETIC FIRST IMPRESSIONS AND IT IS WELL INASMUCH AS I
HAD NEITHER TIME NOR MOOD TO CHERISH SUCH ARRIVING AS I DID LATE ON A
DARK RAW AND RAINY EVENING IN A BABYLON AND A WILDERNESS OF WHICH
THE VASTNESS AND THE STRANGENESS TRIED TO THE UTMOST ANY POWERS OF
CLEAR THOUGHT AND STEADY SELF POSSESSION WITH WHICH IN THE ABSENCE OF
MORE BRILLIANT FACULTIES NATURE MIGHT HAVE GIFTED ME
WHEN I LEFT THE COACH THE STRANGE SPEECH OF THE CABMEN AND OTHERS
WAITING ROUND SEEMED TO ME ODD AS A FOREIGN TONGUE
I HAD NEVER BEFORE
HEARD THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE CHOPPED UP IN THAT WAY
HOWEVER I MANAGED
TO UNDERSTAND AND TO BE UNDERSTOOD SO FAR AS TO GET MYSELF AND TRUNK
SAFELY CONVEYED TO THE OLD INN WHEREOF I HAD THE ADDRESS
HOW
DIFFICULT HOW OPPRESSIVE HOW PUZZLING SEEMED MY FLIGHT IN LONDON FOR
THE FIRST TIME AT AN INN FOR THE FIRST TIME TIRED WITH TRAVELLING
CONFUSED WITH DARKNESS PALSIED WITH COLD UNFURNISHED WITH EITHER
EXPERIENCE OR ADVICE TO TELL ME HOW TO ACT AND YET TO ACT OBLIGED
INTO THE HANDS OF COMMON SENSE I CONFIDED THE MATTER
COMMON SENSE
HOWEVER WAS AS CHILLED AND BEWILDERED AS ALL MY OTHER FACULTIES AND
IT WAS ONLY UNDER THE SPUR OF AN INEXORABLE NECESSITY THAT SHE
SPASMODICALLY EXECUTED HER TRUST
THUS URGED SHE PAID THE PORTER
CONSIDERING THE CRISIS I DID NOT BLAME HER TOO MUCH THAT SHE WAS
HUGELY CHEATED SHE ASKED THE WAITER FOR A ROOM SHE TIMOROUSLY CALLED
FOR THE CHAMBERMAID WHAT IS FAR MORE SHE BORE WITHOUT BEING WHOLLY
OVERCOME A HIGHLY SUPERCILIOUS STYLE OF DEMEANOUR FROM THAT YOUNG
LADY WHEN SHE APPEARED
I RECOLLECT THIS SAME CHAMBERMAID WAS A PATTERN OF TOWN PRETTINESS AND
SMARTNESS
SO TRIM HER WAIST HER CAP HER DRESS I WONDERED HOW THEY
HAD ALL BEEN MANUFACTURED
HER SPEECH HAD AN ACCENT WHICH IN ITS
MINCING GLIBNESS SEEMED TO REBUKE MINE AS BY AUTHORITY HER SPRUCE
ATTIRE FLAUNTED AN EASY SCORN TO MY PLAIN COUNTRY GARB
WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED I THOUGHT AND THEN THE SCENE IS NEW AND
THE CIRCUMSTANCES I SHALL GAIN GOOD
MAINTAINING A VERY QUIET MANNER TOWARDS THIS ARROGANT LITTLE MAID AND
SUBSEQUENTLY OBSERVING THE SAME TOWARDS THE PARSONIC LOOKING
BLACK COATED WHITE NECKCLOTHED WAITER I GOT CIVILITY FROM THEM ERE
LONG
I BELIEVE AT FIRST THEY THOUGHT I WAS A SERVANT BUT IN A LITTLE
WHILE THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND HOVERED IN A DOUBTFUL STATE BETWEEN
PATRONAGE AND POLITENESS
I KEPT UP WELL TILL I HAD PARTAKEN OF SOME REFRESHMENT WARMED MYSELF
BY A FIRE AND WAS FAIRLY SHUT INTO MY OWN ROOM BUT AS I SAT DOWN BY
THE BED AND RESTED MY HEAD AND ARMS ON THE PILLOW A TERRIBLE
OPPRESSION OVERCAME ME
ALL AT ONCE MY POSITION ROSE ON ME LIKE A
GHOST
ANOMALOUS DESOLATE ALMOST BLANK OF HOPE IT STOOD
WHAT WAS I
DOING HERE ALONE IN GREAT LONDON WHAT SHOULD I DO ON THE MORROW WHAT
PROSPECTS HAD I IN LIFE WHAT FRIENDS HAD I ON EARTH WHENCE DID I
COME WHITHER SHOULD I GO WHAT SHOULD I DO
I WET THE PILLOW MY ARMS AND MY HAIR WITH RUSHING TEARS
A DARK
INTERVAL OF MOST BITTER THOUGHT FOLLOWED THIS BURST BUT I DID NOT
REGRET THE STEP TAKEN NOR WISH TO RETRACT IT A STRONG VAGUE
PERSUASION THAT IT WAS BETTER TO GO FORWARD THAN BACKWARD AND THAT I
COULD GO FORWARD THAT A WAY HOWEVER NARROW AND DIFFICULT WOULD IN
TIME OPEN PREDOMINATED OVER OTHER FEELINGS ITS INFLUENCE HUSHED THEM
SO FAR THAT AT LAST I BECAME SUFFICIENTLY TRANQUIL TO BE ABLE TO SAY
MY PRAYERS AND SEEK MY COUCH
I HAD JUST EXTINGUISHED MY CANDLE AND
LAIN DOWN WHEN A DEEP LOW MIGHTY TONE SWUNG THROUGH THE NIGHT
AT
FIRST I KNEW IT NOT BUT IT WAS UTTERED TWELVE TIMES AND AT THE
TWELFTH COLOSSAL HUM AND TREMBLING KNELL I SAID I LIE IN THE SHADOW
OF ST
PAUL'S
CHAPTER VI
LONDON
THE NEXT DAY WAS THE FIRST OF MARCH AND WHEN I AWOKE ROSE AND OPENED
MY CURTAIN I SAW THE RISEN SUN STRUGGLING THROUGH FOG
ABOVE MY HEAD
ABOVE THE HOUSE TOPS CO ELEVATE ALMOST WITH THE CLOUDS I SAW A
SOLEMN ORBED MASS DARK BLUE AND DIM THE DOME
WHILE I LOOKED MY
INNER SELF MOVED MY SPIRIT SHOOK ITS ALWAYS FETTERED WINGS HALF LOOSE
I HAD A SUDDEN FEELING AS IF I WHO NEVER YET TRULY LIVED WERE AT LAST
ABOUT TO TASTE LIFE
IN THAT MORNING MY SOUL GREW AS FAST AS JONAH'S
GOURD
I DID WELL TO COME I SAID PROCEEDING TO DRESS WITH SPEED AND CARE
I LIKE THE SPIRIT OF THIS GREAT LONDON WHICH I FEEL AROUND ME
WHO BUT
A COWARD WOULD PASS HIS WHOLE LIFE IN HAMLETS AND FOR EVER ABANDON HIS
FACULTIES TO THE EATING RUST OF OBSCURITY
BEING DRESSED I WENT DOWN NOT TRAVEL WORN AND EXHAUSTED BUT TIDY AND
REFRESHED
WHEN THE WAITER CAME IN WITH MY BREAKFAST I MANAGED TO
ACCOST HIM SEDATELY YET CHEERFULLY WE HAD TEN MINUTES' DISCOURSE IN
THE COURSE OF WHICH WE BECAME USEFULLY KNOWN TO EACH OTHER
HE WAS A GREY HAIRED ELDERLY MAN AND IT SEEMED HAD LIVED IN HIS
PRESENT PLACE TWENTY YEARS
HAVING ASCERTAINED THIS I WAS SURE HE MUST
REMEMBER MY TWO UNCLES CHARLES AND WILMOT WHO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO
WERE FREQUENT VISITORS HERE
I MENTIONED THEIR NAMES HE RECALLED THEM
PERFECTLY AND WITH RESPECT
HAVING INTIMATED MY CONNECTION MY
POSITION IN HIS EYES WAS HENCEFORTH CLEAR AND ON A RIGHT FOOTING
HE
SAID I WAS LIKE MY UNCLE CHARLES I SUPPOSE HE SPOKE TRUTH BECAUSE
MRS
BARRETT WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SAY THE SAME THING
A READY AND OBLIGING
COURTESY NOW REPLACED HIS FORMER UNCOMFORTABLY DOUBTFUL MANNER
HENCEFORTH I NEED NO LONGER BE AT A LOSS FOR A CIVIL ANSWER TO A
SENSIBLE QUESTION
THE STREET ON WHICH MY LITTLE SITTING ROOM WINDOW LOOKED WAS NARROW
PERFECTLY QUIET AND NOT DIRTY THE FEW PASSENGERS WERE JUST SUCH AS
ONE SEES IN PROVINCIAL TOWNS HERE WAS NOTHING FORMIDABLE I FELT SURE
I MIGHT VENTURE OUT ALONE
HAVING BREAKFASTED OUT I WENT
ELATION AND PLEASURE WERE IN MY HEART
TO WALK ALONE IN LONDON SEEMED OF ITSELF AN ADVENTURE
PRESENTLY I
FOUND MYSELF IN PATERNOSTER ROW CLASSIC GROUND THIS
I ENTERED A
BOOKSELLER'S SHOP KEPT BY ONE JONES I BOUGHT A LITTLE BOOK A PIECE
OF EXTRAVAGANCE I COULD ILL AFFORD BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD ONE DAY GIVE
OR SEND IT TO MRS
BARRETT
MR
JONES A DRIED IN MAN OF BUSINESS
STOOD BEHIND HIS DESK HE SEEMED ONE OF THE GREATEST AND I ONE OF THE
HAPPIEST OF BEINGS
PRODIGIOUS WAS THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I LIVED THAT MORNING
FINDING MYSELF
BEFORE ST
PAUL'S I WENT IN I MOUNTED TO THE DOME I SAW THENCE
LONDON WITH ITS RIVER AND ITS BRIDGES AND ITS CHURCHES I SAW
ANTIQUE WESTMINSTER AND THE GREEN TEMPLE GARDENS WITH SUN UPON THEM
AND A GLAD BLUE SKY OF EARLY SPRING ABOVE AND BETWEEN THEM AND IT
NOT TOO DENSE A CLOUD OF HAZE
DESCENDING I WENT WANDERING WHITHER CHANCE MIGHT LEAD IN A STILL
ECSTASY OF FREEDOM AND ENJOYMENT AND I GOT I KNOW NOT HOW I GOT INTO
THE HEART OF CITY LIFE
I SAW AND FELT LONDON AT LAST I GOT INTO THE
STRAND I WENT UP CORNHILL I MIXED WITH THE LIFE PASSING ALONG I
DARED THE PERILS OF CROSSINGS
TO DO THIS AND TO DO IT UTTERLY ALONE
GAVE ME PERHAPS AN IRRATIONAL BUT A REAL PLEASURE
SINCE THOSE DAYS
I HAVE SEEN THE WEST END THE PARKS THE FINE SQUARES BUT I LOVE THE
CITY FAR BETTER
THE CITY SEEMS SO MUCH MORE IN EARNEST ITS BUSINESS
ITS RUSH ITS ROAR ARE SUCH SERIOUS THINGS SIGHTS AND SOUNDS
THE
CITY IS GETTING ITS LIVING THE WEST END BUT ENJOYING ITS PLEASURE
AT
THE WEST END YOU MAY BE AMUSED BUT IN THE CITY YOU ARE DEEPLY EXCITED
FAINT AT LAST AND HUNGRY IT WAS YEARS SINCE I HAD FELT SUCH HEALTHY
HUNGER I RETURNED ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK TO MY DARK OLD AND QUIET INN
I DINED ON TWO DISHES A PLAIN JOINT AND VEGETABLES BOTH SEEMED
EXCELLENT HOW MUCH BETTER THAN THE SMALL DAINTY MESSES MISS
MARCHMONT'S COOK USED TO SEND UP TO MY KIND DEAD MISTRESS AND ME AND
TO THE DISCUSSION OF WHICH WE COULD NOT BRING HALF AN APPETITE BETWEEN
US DELIGHTFULLY TIRED I LAY DOWN ON THREE CHAIRS FOR AN HOUR THE
ROOM DID NOT BOAST A SOFA
I SLEPT THEN I WOKE AND THOUGHT FOR TWO
HOURS
MY STATE OF MIND AND ALL ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE JUST NOW
SUCH AS MOST TO FAVOUR THE ADOPTION OF A NEW RESOLUTE AND
DARING PERHAPS DESPERATE LINE OF ACTION
I HAD NOTHING TO LOSE
UNUTTERABLE LOATHING OF A DESOLATE EXISTENCE PAST FORBADE RETURN
IF I
FAILED IN WHAT I NOW DESIGNED TO UNDERTAKE WHO SAVE MYSELF WOULD
SUFFER IF I DIED FAR AWAY FROM HOME I WAS GOING TO SAY BUT I HAD NO
HOME FROM ENGLAND THEN WHO WOULD WEEP
I MIGHT SUFFER I WAS INURED TO SUFFERING DEATH ITSELF HAD NOT I
THOUGHT THOSE TERRORS FOR ME WHICH IT HAS FOR THE SOFTLY REARED
I
HAD ERE THIS LOOKED ON THE THOUGHT OF DEATH WITH A QUIET EYE
PREPARED THEN FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES I FORMED A PROJECT
THAT SAME EVENING I OBTAINED FROM MY FRIEND THE WAITER INFORMATION
RESPECTING THE SAILING OF VESSELS FOR A CERTAIN CONTINENTAL PORT
BOUE MARINE
NO TIME I FOUND WAS TO BE LOST THAT VERY NIGHT I MUST
TAKE MY BERTH
I MIGHT INDEED HAVE WAITED TILL THE MORNING BEFORE
GOING ON BOARD BUT WOULD NOT RUN THE RISK OF BEING TOO LATE
BETTER TAKE YOUR BERTH AT ONCE MA'AM COUNSELLED THE WAITER
I
AGREED WITH HIM AND HAVING DISCHARGED MY BILL AND ACKNOWLEDGED MY
FRIEND'S SERVICES AT A RATE WHICH I NOW KNOW WAS PRINCELY AND WHICH IN
HIS EYES MUST HAVE SEEMED ABSURD AND INDEED WHILE POCKETING THE CASH
HE SMILED A FAINT SMILE WHICH INTIMATED HIS OPINION OF THE DONOR'S
SAVOIR FAIRE HE PROCEEDED TO CALL A COACH
TO THE DRIVER HE ALSO
RECOMMENDED ME GIVING AT THE SAME TIME AN INJUNCTION ABOUT TAKING ME
I THINK TO THE WHARF AND NOT LEAVING ME TO THE WATERMEN WHICH THAT
FUNCTIONARY PROMISED TO OBSERVE BUT FAILED IN KEEPING HIS PROMISE ON
THE CONTRARY HE OFFERED ME UP AS AN OBLATION SERVED ME AS A DRIPPING
ROAST MAKING ME ALIGHT IN THE MIDST OF A THRONG OF WATERMEN
THIS WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE CRISIS
IT WAS A DARK NIGHT
THE COACHMAN
INSTANTLY DROVE OFF AS SOON AS HE HAD GOT HIS FARE THE WATERMEN
COMMENCED A STRUGGLE FOR ME AND MY TRUNK
THEIR OATHS I HEAR AT THIS
MOMENT THEY SHOOK MY PHILOSOPHY MORE THAN DID THE NIGHT OR THE
ISOLATION OR THE STRANGENESS OF THE SCENE
ONE LAID HANDS ON MY TRUNK
I LOOKED ON AND WAITED QUIETLY BUT WHEN ANOTHER LAID HANDS ON ME I
SPOKE UP SHOOK OFF HIS TOUCH STEPPED AT ONCE INTO A BOAT DESIRED
AUSTERELY THAT THE TRUNK SHOULD BE PLACED BESIDE ME JUST
THERE WHICH WAS INSTANTLY DONE FOR THE OWNER OF THE BOAT I HAD
CHOSEN BECAME NOW AN ALLY I WAS ROWED OFF
BLACK WAS THE RIVER AS A TORRENT OF INK LIGHTS GLANCED ON IT FROM THE
PILES OF BUILDING ROUND SHIPS ROCKED ON ITS BOSOM
THEY ROWED ME UP TO
SEVERAL VESSELS I READ BY LANTERN LIGHT THEIR NAMES PAINTED IN GREAT
WHITE LETTERS ON A DARK GROUND
THE OCEAN THE PHOENIX THE
CONSORT THE DOLPHIN WERE PASSED IN TURNS BUT THE VIVID WAS MY
SHIP AND IT SEEMED SHE LAY FURTHER DOWN
DOWN THE SABLE FLOOD WE GLIDED I THOUGHT OF THE STYX AND OF CHARON
ROWING SOME SOLITARY SOUL TO THE LAND OF SHADES
AMIDST THE STRANGE
SCENE WITH A CHILLY WIND BLOWING IN MY FACE AND MIDNIGHT CLOUDS
DROPPING RAIN ABOVE MY HEAD WITH TWO RUDE ROWERS FOR COMPANIONS WHOSE
INSANE OATHS STILL TORTURED MY EAR I ASKED MYSELF IF I WAS WRETCHED OR
TERRIFIED
I WAS NEITHER
OFTEN IN MY LIFE HAVE I BEEN FAR MORE SO
UNDER COMPARATIVELY SAFE CIRCUMSTANCES
HOW IS THIS SAID I
METHINKS I AM ANIMATED AND ALERT INSTEAD OF BEING DEPRESSED AND
APPREHENSIVE I COULD NOT TELL HOW IT WAS
THE VIVID STARTED OUT WHITE AND GLARING FROM THE BLACK NIGHT AT
LAST HERE YOU ARE SAID THE WATERMAN AND INSTANTLY DEMANDED SIX
SHILLINGS
YOU ASK TOO MUCH I SAID
HE DREW OFF FROM THE VESSEL AND SWORE HE
WOULD NOT EMBARK ME TILL I PAID IT
A YOUNG MAN THE STEWARD AS I FOUND
AFTERWARDS WAS LOOKING OVER THE SHIP'S SIDE HE GRINNED A SMILE IN
ANTICIPATION OF THE COMING CONTEST TO DISAPPOINT HIM I PAID THE
MONEY
THREE TIMES THAT AFTERNOON I HAD GIVEN CROWNS WHERE I SHOULD
HAVE GIVEN SHILLINGS BUT I CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE REFLECTION IT IS
THE PRICE OF EXPERIENCE
THEY'VE CHEATED YOU SAID THE STEWARD EXULTINGLY WHEN I GOT ON BOARD
I ANSWERED PHLEGMATICALLY THAT I KNEW IT AND WENT BELOW
A STOUT HANDSOME AND SHOWY WOMAN WAS IN THE LADIES' CABIN
I ASKED TO
BE SHOWN MY BERTH SHE LOOKED HARD AT ME MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT ITS
BEING UNUSUAL FOR PASSENGERS TO COME ON BOARD AT THAT HOUR AND SEEMED
DISPOSED TO BE LESS THAN CIVIL
WHAT A FACE SHE HAD SO COMELY SO
INSOLENT AND SO SELFISH
NOW THAT I AM ON BOARD I SHALL CERTAINLY STAY HERE WAS MY ANSWER
I WILL TROUBLE YOU TO SHOW ME MY BERTH
SHE COMPLIED BUT SULLENLY
I TOOK OFF MY BONNET ARRANGED MY THINGS
AND LAY DOWN
SOME DIFFICULTIES HAD BEEN PASSED THROUGH A SORT OF
VICTORY WAS WON MY HOMELESS ANCHORLESS UNSUPPORTED MIND HAD AGAIN
LEISURE FOR A BRIEF REPOSE
TILL THE VIVID ARRIVED IN HARBOUR NO
FURTHER ACTION WOULD BE REQUIRED OF ME BUT THEN
OH I COULD NOT
LOOK FORWARD
HARASSED EXHAUSTED I LAY IN A HALF TRANCE
THE STEWARDESS TALKED ALL NIGHT NOT TO ME BUT TO THE YOUNG STEWARD
HER SON AND HER VERY PICTURE
HE PASSED IN AND OUT OF THE CABIN
CONTINUALLY THEY DISPUTED THEY QUARRELLED THEY MADE IT UP AGAIN
TWENTY TIMES IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT
SHE PROFESSED TO BE WRITING A
LETTER HOME SHE SAID TO HER FATHER SHE READ PASSAGES OF IT ALOUD
HEEDING ME NO MORE THAN A STOCK PERHAPS SHE BELIEVED ME ASLEEP
SEVERAL OF THESE PASSAGES APPEARED TO COMPRISE FAMILY SECRETS AND BORE
SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ONE CHARLOTTE A YOUNGER SISTER WHO FROM THE
BEARING OF THE EPISTLE SEEMED TO BE ON THE BRINK OF PERPETRATING A
ROMANTIC AND IMPRUDENT MATCH LOUD WAS THE PROTEST OF THIS ELDER LADY
AGAINST THE DISTASTEFUL UNION
THE DUTIFUL SON LAUGHED HIS MOTHER'S
CORRESPONDENCE TO SCORN
SHE DEFENDED IT AND RAVED AT HIM
THEY WERE A
STRANGE PAIR
SHE MIGHT BE THIRTY NINE OR FORTY AND WAS BUXOM AND
BLOOMING AS A GIRL OF TWENTY
HARD LOUD VAIN AND VULGAR HER MIND AND
BODY ALIKE SEEMED BRAZEN AND IMPERISHABLE
I SHOULD THINK FROM HER
CHILDHOOD SHE MUST HAVE LIVED IN PUBLIC STATIONS AND IN HER YOUTH
MIGHT VERY LIKELY HAVE BEEN A BARMAID
TOWARDS MORNING HER DISCOURSE RAN ON A NEW THEME THE WATSONS A
CERTAIN EXPECTED FAMILY PARTY OF PASSENGERS KNOWN TO HER IT APPEARED
AND BY HER MUCH ESTEEMED ON ACCOUNT OF THE HANDSOME PROFIT REALIZED IN
THEIR FEES
SHE SAID IT WAS AS GOOD AS A LITTLE FORTUNE TO HER
WHENEVER THIS FAMILY CROSSED
AT DAWN ALL WERE ASTIR AND BY SUNRISE THE PASSENGERS CAME ON BOARD
BOISTEROUS WAS THE WELCOME GIVEN BY THE STEWARDESS TO THE WATSONS
AND GREAT WAS THE BUSTLE MADE IN THEIR HONOUR
THEY WERE FOUR IN
NUMBER TWO MALES AND TWO FEMALES
BESIDES THEM THERE WAS BUT ONE
OTHER PASSENGER A YOUNG LADY WHOM A GENTLEMANLY THOUGH
LANGUID LOOKING MAN ESCORTED
THE TWO GROUPS OFFERED A MARKED CONTRAST
THE WATSONS WERE DOUBTLESS RICH PEOPLE FOR THEY HAD THE CONFIDENCE OF
CONSCIOUS WEALTH IN THEIR BEARING THE WOMEN YOUTHFUL BOTH OF THEM
AND ONE PERFECTLY HANDSOME AS FAR AS PHYSICAL BEAUTY WENT WERE
DRESSED RICHLY GAILY AND ABSURDLY OUT OF CHARACTER FOR THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
THEIR BONNETS WITH BRIGHT FLOWERS THEIR VELVET CLOAKS
AND SILK DRESSES SEEMED BETTER SUITED FOR PARK OR PROMENADE THAN FOR A
DAMP PACKET DECK
THE MEN WERE OF LOW STATURE PLAIN FAT AND VULGAR
THE OLDEST PLAINEST GREASIEST BROADEST I SOON FOUND WAS THE
HUSBAND THE BRIDEGROOM I SUPPOSE FOR SHE WAS VERY YOUNG OF THE
BEAUTIFUL GIRL
DEEP WAS MY AMAZEMENT AT THIS DISCOVERY AND DEEPER
STILL WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT INSTEAD OF BEING DESPERATELY WRETCHED IN
SUCH A UNION SHE WAS GAY EVEN TO GIDDINESS
HER LAUGHTER I
REFLECTED MUST BE THE MERE FRENZY OF DESPAIR AND EVEN WHILE THIS
THOUGHT WAS CROSSING MY MIND AS I STOOD LEANING QUIET AND SOLITARY
AGAINST THE SHIP'S SIDE SHE CAME TRIPPING UP TO ME AN UTTER STRANGER
WITH A CAMP STOOL IN HER HAND AND SMILING A SMILE OF WHICH THE LEVITY
PUZZLED AND STARTLED ME THOUGH IT SHOWED A PERFECT SET OF PERFECT
TEETH SHE OFFERED ME THE ACCOMMODATION OF THIS PIECE OF FURNITURE
I
DECLINED IT OF COURSE WITH ALL THE COURTESY I COULD PUT INTO MY
MANNER SHE DANCED OFF HEEDLESS AND LIGHTSOME
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
GOOD NATURED BUT WHAT HAD MADE HER MARRY THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS AT
LEAST AS MUCH LIKE AN OIL BARREL AS A MAN
THE OTHER LADY PASSENGER WITH THE GENTLEMAN COMPANION WAS QUITE A
GIRL PRETTY AND FAIR HER SIMPLE PRINT DRESS UNTRIMMED STRAW BONNET
AND LARGE SHAWL GRACEFULLY WORN FORMED A COSTUME PLAIN TO QUAKERISM
YET FOR HER BECOMING ENOUGH
BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN QUITTED HER I
OBSERVED HIM THROWING A GLANCE OF SCRUTINY OVER ALL THE PASSENGERS AS
IF TO ASCERTAIN IN WHAT COMPANY HIS CHARGE WOULD BE LEFT
WITH A MOST
DISSATISFIED AIR DID HIS EYE TURN FROM THE LADIES WITH THE GAY FLOWERS
HE LOOKED AT ME AND THEN HE SPOKE TO HIS DAUGHTER NIECE OR WHATEVER
SHE WAS SHE ALSO GLANCED IN MY DIRECTION AND SLIGHTLY CURLED HER
SHORT PRETTY LIP
IT MIGHT BE MYSELF OR IT MIGHT BE MY HOMELY
MOURNING HABIT THAT ELICITED THIS MARK OF CONTEMPT MORE LIKELY BOTH
A BELL RANG HER FATHER I AFTERWARDS KNEW THAT IT WAS HER FATHER
KISSED HER AND RETURNED TO LAND
THE PACKET SAILED
FOREIGNERS SAY THAT IT IS ONLY ENGLISH GIRLS WHO CAN THUS BE TRUSTED TO
TRAVEL ALONE AND DEEP IS THEIR WONDER AT THE DARING CONFIDENCE OF
ENGLISH PARENTS AND GUARDIANS
AS FOR THE JEUNES MEESS BY SOME THEIR
INTREPIDITY IS PRONOUNCED MASCULINE AND INCONVENANT OTHERS REGARD
THEM AS THE PASSIVE VICTIMS OF AN EDUCATIONAL AND THEOLOGICAL SYSTEM
WHICH WANTONLY DISPENSES WITH PROPER SURVEILLANCE WHETHER THIS
PARTICULAR YOUNG LADY WAS OF THE SORT THAT CAN THE MOST SAFELY BE LEFT
UNWATCHED I DO NOT KNOW OR RATHER DID NOT THEN KNOW BUT IT SOON
APPEARED THAT THE DIGNITY OF SOLITUDE WAS NOT TO HER TASTE
SHE PACED
THE DECK ONCE OR TWICE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS SHE LOOKED WITH A LITTLE
SOUR AIR OF DISDAIN AT THE FLAUNTING SILKS AND VELVETS AND THE BEARS
WHICH THEREON DANCED ATTENDANCE AND EVENTUALLY SHE APPROACHED ME AND
SPOKE
ARE YOU FOND OF A SEA VOYAGE WAS HER QUESTION
I EXPLAINED THAT MY FONDNESS FOR A SEA VOYAGE HAD YET TO UNDERGO THE
TEST OF EXPERIENCE I HAD NEVER MADE ONE
OH HOW CHARMING CRIED SHE
I QUITE ENVY YOU THE NOVELTY FIRST
IMPRESSIONS YOU KNOW ARE SO PLEASANT
NOW I HAVE MADE SO MANY I
QUITE FORGET THE FIRST I AM QUITE BLASE ABOUT THE SEA AND ALL THAT
I COULD NOT HELP SMILING
WHY DO YOU LAUGH AT ME SHE INQUIRED WITH A FRANK TESTINESS THAT
PLEASED ME BETTER THAN HER OTHER TALK
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO YOUNG TO BE BLASE ABOUT ANYTHING
I AM SEVENTEEN A LITTLE PIQUED
YOU HARDLY LOOK SIXTEEN
DO YOU LIKE TRAVELLING ALONE
BAH I CARE NOTHING ABOUT IT
I HAVE CROSSED THE CHANNEL TEN TIMES
ALONE BUT THEN I TAKE CARE NEVER TO BE LONG ALONE I ALWAYS MAKE
FRIENDS
YOU WILL SCARCELY MAKE MANY FRIENDS THIS VOYAGE I THINK GLANCING AT
THE WATSON GROUP WHO WERE NOW LAUGHING AND MAKING A GREAT DEAL OF
NOISE ON DECK
NOT OF THOSE ODIOUS MEN AND WOMEN SAID SHE SUCH PEOPLE SHOULD BE
STEERAGE PASSENGERS
ARE YOU GOING TO SCHOOL
NO
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA BEYOND AT LEAST THE PORT OF BOUE MARINE
SHE STARED THEN CARELESSLY RAN ON
I AM GOING TO SCHOOL
OH THE NUMBER OF FOREIGN SCHOOLS I HAVE BEEN AT
IN MY LIFE AND YET I AM QUITE AN IGNORAMUS
I KNOW NOTHING NOTHING IN
THE WORLD I ASSURE YOU EXCEPT THAT I PLAY AND DANCE BEAUTIFULLY AND
FRENCH AND GERMAN OF COURSE I KNOW TO SPEAK BUT I CAN'T READ OR WRITE
THEM VERY WELL
DO YOU KNOW THEY WANTED ME TO TRANSLATE A PAGE OF AN
EASY GERMAN BOOK INTO ENGLISH THE OTHER DAY AND I COULDN'T DO IT
PAPA
WAS SO MORTIFIED HE SAYS IT LOOKS AS IF M
DE BASSOMPIERRE MY
GODPAPA WHO PAYS ALL MY SCHOOL BILLS HAD THROWN AWAY ALL HIS MONEY
AND THEN IN MATTERS OF INFORMATION IN HISTORY GEOGRAPHY ARITHMETIC
AND SO ON I AM QUITE A BABY AND I WRITE ENGLISH SO BADLY SUCH
SPELLING AND GRAMMAR THEY TELL ME
INTO THE BARGAIN I HAVE QUITE
FORGOTTEN MY RELIGION THEY CALL ME A PROTESTANT YOU KNOW BUT REALLY
I AM NOT SURE WHETHER I AM ONE OR NOT I DON'T WELL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ROMANISM AND PROTESTANTISM
HOWEVER I DON'T IN THE LEAST CARE
FOR THAT
I WAS A LUTHERAN ONCE AT BONN DEAR BONN CHARMING
BONN WHERE THERE WERE SO MANY HANDSOME STUDENTS
EVERY NICE GIRL IN
OUR SCHOOL HAD AN ADMIRER THEY KNEW OUR HOURS FOR WALKING OUT AND
ALMOST ALWAYS PASSED US ON THE PROMENADE 'SCHNES MDCHEN WE USED TO
HEAR THEM SAY
I WAS EXCESSIVELY HAPPY AT BONN
AND WHERE ARE YOU NOW I INQUIRED
OH AT CHOSE SAID SHE
NOW MISS GINEVRA FANSHAWE SUCH WAS THIS YOUNG PERSON'S NAME ONLY
SUBSTITUTED THIS WORD CHOSE IN TEMPORARY OBLIVION OF THE REAL NAME
IT WAS A HABIT SHE HAD CHOSE CAME IN AT EVERY TURN IN HER
CONVERSATION THE CONVENIENT SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY MISSING WORD IN ANY
LANGUAGE SHE MIGHT CHANCE AT THE TIME TO BE SPEAKING
FRENCH GIRLS
OFTEN DO THE LIKE FROM THEM SHE HAD CAUGHT THE CUSTOM
CHOSE
HOWEVER I FOUND IN THIS INSTANCE STOOD FOR VILLETTE THE GREAT
CAPITAL OF THE GREAT KINGDOM OF LABASSECOUR
DO YOU LIKE VILLETTE I ASKED
PRETTY WELL
THE NATIVES YOU KNOW ARE INTENSELY STUPID AND VULGAR
BUT THERE ARE SOME NICE ENGLISH FAMILIES
ARE YOU IN A SCHOOL
YES
A GOOD ONE
OH NO HORRID BUT I GO OUT EVERY SUNDAY AND CARE NOTHING ABOUT THE
MATRESSES OR THE PROFESSEURS OR THE LVES AND SEND LESSONS
AU DIABLE ONE DAREN'T SAY THAT IN ENGLISH YOU KNOW BUT IT SOUNDS
QUITE RIGHT IN FRENCH AND THUS I GET ON CHARMINGLY
YOU ARE
LAUGHING AT ME AGAIN
NO I AM ONLY SMILING AT MY OWN THOUGHTS
WHAT ARE THEY WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER NOW DO TELL ME
WHERE YOU ARE GOING
WHERE FATE MAY LEAD ME
MY BUSINESS IS TO EARN A LIVING WHERE I CAN
FIND IT
TO EARN IN CONSTERNATION ARE YOU POOR THEN
AS POOR AS JOB
AFTER A PAUSE BAH HOW UNPLEASANT BUT I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE
POOR THEY ARE POOR ENOUGH AT HOME PAPA AND MAMMA AND ALL OF THEM
PAPA IS CALLED CAPTAIN FANSHAWE HE IS AN OFFICER ON HALF PAY BUT
WELL DESCENDED AND SOME OF OUR CONNECTIONS ARE GREAT ENOUGH BUT MY
UNCLE AND GODPAPA DE BASSOMPIERRE WHO LIVES IN FRANCE IS THE ONLY ONE
THAT HELPS US HE EDUCATES US GIRLS
I HAVE FIVE SISTERS AND THREE
BROTHERS
BY AND BY WE ARE TO MARRY RATHER ELDERLY GENTLEMEN I
SUPPOSE WITH CASH PAPA AND MAMMA MANAGE THAT
MY SISTER AUGUSTA IS
MARRIED NOW TO A MAN MUCH OLDER LOOKING THAN PAPA
AUGUSTA IS VERY
BEAUTIFUL NOT IN MY STYLE BUT DARK HER HUSBAND MR
DAVIES HAD THE
YELLOW FEVER IN INDIA AND HE IS STILL THE COLOUR OF A GUINEA BUT THEN
HE IS RICH AND AUGUSTA HAS HER CARRIAGE AND ESTABLISHMENT AND WE ALL
THINK SHE HAS DONE PERFECTLY WELL
NOW THIS IS BETTER THAN 'EARNING A
LIVING AS YOU SAY
BY THE WAY ARE YOU CLEVER
NO NOT AT ALL
YOU CAN PLAY SING SPEAK THREE OR FOUR LANGUAGES
BY NO MEANS
STILL I THINK YOU ARE CLEVER A PAUSE AND A YAWN
SHALL YOU BE SEA SICK
SHALL YOU
OH IMMENSELY AS SOON AS EVER WE GET IN SIGHT OF THE SEA I BEGIN
INDEED TO FEEL IT ALREADY
I SHALL GO BELOW AND WON'T I ORDER ABOUT
THAT FAT ODIOUS STEWARDESS HEUREUSEMENT JE SAIS FAIRE ALLER MON MONDE
DOWN SHE WENT
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE OTHER PASSENGERS FOLLOWED HER THROUGHOUT
THE AFTERNOON I REMAINED ON DECK ALONE
WHEN I RECALL THE TRANQUIL AND
EVEN HAPPY MOOD IN WHICH I PASSED THOSE HOURS AND REMEMBER AT THE
SAME TIME THE POSITION IN WHICH I WAS PLACED ITS HAZARDOUS SOME
WOULD HAVE SAID ITS HOPELESS CHARACTER I FEEL THAT AS
STONE WALLS DO NOT A PRISON MAKE
NOR IRON BARS A CAGE
SO PERIL LONELINESS AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE ARE NOT OPPRESSIVE EVILS SO
LONG AS THE FRAME IS HEALTHY AND THE FACULTIES ARE EMPLOYED SO LONG
ESPECIALLY AS LIBERTY LENDS US HER WINGS AND HOPE GUIDES US BY HER
STAR
I WAS NOT SICK TILL LONG AFTER WE PASSED MARGATE AND DEEP WAS THE
PLEASURE I DRANK IN WITH THE SEA BREEZE DIVINE THE DELIGHT I DREW FROM
THE HEAVING CHANNEL WAVES FROM THE SEA BIRDS ON THEIR RIDGES FROM THE
WHITE SAILS ON THEIR DARK DISTANCE FROM THE QUIET YET BECLOUDED SKY
OVERHANGING ALL
IN MY REVERIE METHOUGHT I SAW THE CONTINENT OF
EUROPE LIKE A WIDE DREAM LAND FAR AWAY
SUNSHINE LAY ON IT MAKING
THE LONG COAST ONE LINE OF GOLD TINIEST TRACERY OF CLUSTERED TOWN AND
SNOW GLEAMING TOWER OF WOODS DEEP MASSED OF HEIGHTS SERRATED OF
SMOOTH PASTURAGE AND VEINY STREAM EMBOSSED THE METAL BRIGHT PROSPECT
FOR BACKGROUND SPREAD A SKY SOLEMN AND DARK BLUE AND GRAND WITH
IMPERIAL PROMISE SOFT WITH TINTS OF ENCHANTMENT STRODE FROM NORTH TO
SOUTH A GOD BENT BOW AN ARCH OF HOPE
CANCEL THE WHOLE OF THAT IF YOU PLEASE READER OR RATHER LET IT
STAND AND DRAW THENCE A MORAL AN ALLITERATIVE TEXT HAND COPY
DAY DREAMS ARE DELUSIONS OF THE DEMON
BECOMING EXCESSIVELY SICK I FALTERED DOWN INTO THE CABIN
MISS FANSHAWE'S BERTH CHANCED TO BE NEXT MINE AND I AM SORRY TO SAY
SHE TORMENTED ME WITH AN UNSPARING SELFISHNESS DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF
OUR MUTUAL DISTRESS
NOTHING COULD EXCEED HER IMPATIENCE AND
FRETFULNESS
THE WATSONS WHO WERE VERY SICK TOO AND ON WHOM THE
STEWARDESS ATTENDED WITH SHAMELESS PARTIALITY WERE STOICS COMPARED
WITH HER
MANY A TIME SINCE HAVE I NOTICED IN PERSONS OF GINEVRA
FANSHAWE'S LIGHT CARELESS TEMPERAMENT AND FAIR FRAGILE STYLE OF
BEAUTY AN ENTIRE INCAPACITY TO ENDURE THEY SEEM TO SOUR IN ADVERSITY
LIKE SMALL BEER IN THUNDER
THE MAN WHO TAKES SUCH A WOMAN FOR HIS
WIFE OUGHT TO BE PREPARED TO GUARANTEE HER AN EXISTENCE ALL SUNSHINE
INDIGNANT AT LAST WITH HER TEASING PEEVISHNESS I CURTLY REQUESTED HER
TO HOLD HER TONGUE THE REBUFF DID HER GOOD AND IT WAS OBSERVABLE
THAT SHE LIKED ME NO WORSE FOR IT
AS DARK NIGHT DREW ON THE SEA ROUGHENED LARGER WAVES SWAYED STRONG
AGAINST THE VESSEL'S SIDE
IT WAS STRANGE TO REFLECT THAT BLACKNESS AND
WATER WERE ROUND US AND TO FEEL THE SHIP PLOUGHING STRAIGHT ON HER
PATHLESS WAY DESPITE NOISE BILLOW AND RISING GALE
ARTICLES OF
FURNITURE BEGAN TO FALL ABOUT AND IT BECAME NEEDFUL TO LASH THEM TO
THEIR PLACES THE PASSENGERS GREW SICKER THAN EVER MISS FANSHAWE
DECLARED WITH GROANS THAT SHE MUST DIE
NOT JUST YET HONEY SAID THE STEWARDESS
WE'RE JUST IN PORT
ACCORDINGLY IN ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR A CALM FELL UPON US ALL
AND ABOUT MIDNIGHT THE VOYAGE ENDED
I WAS SORRY YES I WAS SORRY
MY RESTING TIME WAS PAST MY
DIFFICULTIES MY STRINGENT DIFFICULTIES RECOMMENCED
WHEN I WENT ON
DECK THE COLD AIR AND BLACK SCOWL OF THE NIGHT SEEMED TO REBUKE ME FOR
MY PRESUMPTION IN BEING WHERE I WAS THE LIGHTS OF THE FOREIGN SEA PORT
TOWN GLIMMERING ROUND THE FOREIGN HARBOUR MET ME LIKE UNNUMBERED
THREATENING EYES
FRIENDS CAME ON BOARD TO WELCOME THE WATSONS A WHOLE
FAMILY OF FRIENDS SURROUNDED AND BORE AWAY MISS FANSHAWE I BUT I
DARED NOT FOR ONE MOMENT DWELL ON A COMPARISON OF POSITIONS
YET WHERE SHOULD I GO I MUST GO SOMEWHERE
NECESSITY DARE NOT BE NICE
AS I GAVE THE STEWARDESS HER FEE AND SHE SEEMED SURPRISED AT RECEIVING
A COIN OF MORE VALUE THAN FROM SUCH A QUARTER HER COARSE CALCULATIONS
HAD PROBABLY RECKONED ON I SAID BE KIND ENOUGH TO DIRECT ME TO SOME
QUIET RESPECTABLE INN WHERE I CAN GO FOR THE NIGHT
SHE NOT ONLY GAVE ME THE REQUIRED DIRECTION BUT CALLED A
COMMISSIONAIRE AND BID HIM TAKE CHARGE OF ME AND NOT MY TRUNK FOR
THAT WAS GONE TO THE CUSTOM HOUSE
I FOLLOWED THIS MAN ALONG A RUDELY PAVED STREET LIT NOW BY A FITFUL
GLEAM OF MOONLIGHT HE BROUGHT ME TO THE INN
I OFFERED HIM SIXPENCE
WHICH HE REFUSED TO TAKE SUPPOSING IT NOT ENOUGH I CHANGED IT FOR A
SHILLING BUT THIS ALSO HE DECLINED SPEAKING RATHER SHARPLY IN A
LANGUAGE TO ME UNKNOWN
A WAITER COMING FORWARD INTO THE LAMP LIT
INN PASSAGE REMINDED ME IN BROKEN ENGLISH THAT MY MONEY WAS FOREIGN
MONEY NOT CURRENT HERE
I GAVE HIM A SOVEREIGN TO CHANGE
THIS LITTLE
MATTER SETTLED I ASKED FOR A BEDROOM SUPPER I COULD NOT TAKE I WAS
STILL SEA SICK AND UNNERVED AND TREMBLING ALL OVER
HOW DEEPLY GLAD I
WAS WHEN THE DOOR OF A VERY SMALL CHAMBER AT LENGTH CLOSED ON ME AND MY
EXHAUSTION
AGAIN I MIGHT REST THOUGH THE CLOUD OF DOUBT WOULD BE AS
THICK TO MORROW AS EVER THE NECESSITY FOR EXERTION MORE URGENT THE
PERIL OF DESTITUTION NEARER THE CONFLICT FOR EXISTENCE MORE SEVERE
CHAPTER VII
VILLETTE
I AWOKE NEXT MORNING WITH COURAGE REVIVED AND SPIRITS REFRESHED
PHYSICAL DEBILITY NO LONGER ENERVATED MY JUDGMENT MY MIND FELT PROMPT
AND CLEAR
JUST AS I FINISHED DRESSING A TAP CAME TO THE DOOR I SAID COME IN
EXPECTING THE CHAMBERMAID WHEREAS A ROUGH MAN WALKED IN AND SAID
GIF ME YOUR KEYS MEESS
WHY I ASKED
GIF SAID HE IMPATIENTLY AND AS HE HALF SNATCHED THEM FROM MY HAND
HE ADDED ALL RIGHT HAF YOUR TRONC SOON
FORTUNATELY IT DID TURN OUT ALL RIGHT HE WAS FROM THE CUSTOM HOUSE
WHERE TO GO TO GET SOME BREAKFAST I COULD NOT TELL BUT I PROCEEDED
NOT WITHOUT HESITATION TO DESCEND
I NOW OBSERVED WHAT I HAD NOT NOTICED IN MY EXTREME WEARINESS LAST
NIGHT VIZ
THAT THIS INN WAS IN FACT A LARGE HOTEL AND AS I SLOWLY
DESCENDED THE BROAD STAIRCASE HALTING ON EACH STEP FOR I WAS IN
WONDERFULLY LITTLE HASTE TO GET DOWN I GAZED AT THE HIGH CEILING
ABOVE ME AT THE PAINTED WALLS AROUND AT THE WIDE WINDOWS WHICH FILLED
THE HOUSE WITH LIGHT AT THE VEINED MARBLE I TROD FOR THE STEPS WERE
ALL OF MARBLE THOUGH UNCARPETED AND NOT VERY CLEAN AND CONTRASTING
ALL THIS WITH THE DIMENSIONS OF THE CLOSET ASSIGNED TO ME AS A CHAMBER
WITH THE EXTREME MODESTY OF ITS APPOINTMENTS I FELL INTO A
PHILOSOPHIZING MOOD
MUCH I MARVELLED AT THE SAGACITY EVINCED BY WAITERS AND CHAMBER MAIDS
IN PROPORTIONING THE ACCOMMODATION TO THE GUEST
HOW COULD INN SERVANTS
AND SHIP STEWARDESSES EVERYWHERE TELL AT A GLANCE THAT I FOR INSTANCE
WAS AN INDIVIDUAL OF NO SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE AND LITTLE BURDENED BY
CASH THEY DID KNOW IT EVIDENTLY I SAW QUITE WELL THAT THEY ALL IN
A MOMENT'S CALCULATION ESTIMATED ME AT ABOUT THE SAME FRACTIONAL
VALUE
THE FACT SEEMED TO ME CURIOUS AND PREGNANT I WOULD NOT DISGUISE
FROM MYSELF WHAT IT INDICATED YET MANAGED TO KEEP UP MY SPIRITS PRETTY
WELL UNDER ITS PRESSURE
HAVING AT LAST LANDED IN A GREAT HALL FULL OF SKYLIGHT GLARE I MADE
MY WAY SOMEHOW TO WHAT PROVED TO BE THE COFFEE ROOM
IT CANNOT BE
DENIED THAT ON ENTERING THIS ROOM I TREMBLED SOMEWHAT FELT UNCERTAIN
SOLITARY WRETCHED WISHED TO HEAVEN I KNEW WHETHER I WAS DOING RIGHT
OR WRONG FELT CONVINCED THAT IT WAS THE LAST BUT COULD NOT HELP
MYSELF
ACTING IN THE SPIRIT AND WITH THE CALM OF A FATALIST I SAT
DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE TO WHICH A WAITER PRESENTLY BROUGHT ME SOME
BREAKFAST AND I PARTOOK OF THAT MEAL IN A FRAME OF MIND NOT GREATLY
CALCULATED TO FAVOUR DIGESTION
THERE WERE MANY OTHER PEOPLE
BREAKFASTING AT OTHER TABLES IN THE ROOM I SHOULD HAVE FELT RATHER
MORE HAPPY IF AMONGST THEM ALL I COULD HAVE SEEN ANY WOMEN HOWEVER
THERE WAS NOT ONE ALL PRESENT WERE MEN
BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO THINK I
WAS DOING ANYTHING STRANGE ONE OR TWO GENTLEMEN GLANCED AT ME
OCCASIONALLY BUT NONE STARED OBTRUSIVELY I SUPPOSE IF THERE WAS
ANYTHING ECCENTRIC IN THE BUSINESS THEY ACCOUNTED FOR IT BY THIS WORD
ANGLAISE
BREAKFAST OVER I MUST AGAIN MOVE IN WHAT DIRECTION GO TO VILLETTE
SAID AN INWARD VOICE PROMPTED DOUBTLESS BY THE RECOLLECTION OF THIS
SLIGHT SENTENCE UTTERED CARELESSLY AND AT RANDOM BY MISS FANSHAWE AS
SHE BID ME GOOD BY I WISH YOU WOULD COME TO MADAME BECK'S SHE HAS
SOME MARMOTS WHOM YOU MIGHT LOOK AFTER SHE WANTS AN ENGLISH
GOUVERNANTE OR WAS WANTING ONE TWO MONTHS AGO
WHO MADAME BECK WAS WHERE SHE LIVED I KNEW NOT I HAD ASKED BUT THE
QUESTION PASSED UNHEARD MISS FANSHAWE HURRIED AWAY BY HER FRIENDS
LEFT IT UNANSWERED
I PRESUMED VILLETTE TO BE HER RESIDENCE TO
VILLETTE I WOULD GO
THE DISTANCE WAS FORTY MILES
I KNEW I WAS
CATCHING AT STRAWS BUT IN THE WIDE AND WELTERING DEEP WHERE I FOUND
MYSELF I WOULD HAVE CAUGHT AT COBWEBS
HAVING INQUIRED ABOUT THE MEANS
OF TRAVELLING TO VILLETTE AND SECURED A SEAT IN THE DILIGENCE I
DEPARTED ON THE STRENGTH OF THIS OUTLINE THIS SHADOW OF A PROJECT
BEFORE YOU PRONOUNCE ON THE RASHNESS OF THE PROCEEDING READER LOOK
BACK TO THE POINT WHENCE I STARTED CONSIDER THE DESERT I HAD LEFT
NOTE HOW LITTLE I PERILLED MINE WAS THE GAME WHERE THE PLAYER CANNOT
LOSE AND MAY WIN
OF AN ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT I DENY THAT I AM YET I MUST POSSESS
SOMETHING OF THE ARTIST'S FACULTY OF MAKING THE MOST OF PRESENT
PLEASURE THAT IS TO SAY WHEN IT IS OF THE KIND TO MY TASTE
I ENJOYED
THAT DAY THOUGH WE TRAVELLED SLOWLY THOUGH IT WAS COLD THOUGH IT
RAINED
SOMEWHAT BARE FLAT AND TREELESS WAS THE ROUTE ALONG WHICH OUR
JOURNEY LAY AND SLIMY CANALS CREPT LIKE HALF TORPID GREEN SNAKES
BESIDE THE ROAD AND FORMAL POLLARD WILLOWS EDGED LEVEL FIELDS TILLED
LIKE KITCHEN GARDEN BEDS
THE SKY TOO WAS MONOTONOUSLY GRAY THE
ATMOSPHERE WAS STAGNANT AND HUMID YET AMIDST ALL THESE DEADENING
INFLUENCES MY FANCY BUDDED FRESH AND MY HEART BASKED IN SUNSHINE
THESE FEELINGS HOWEVER WERE WELL KEPT IN CHECK BY THE SECRET BUT
CEASELESS CONSCIOUSNESS OF ANXIETY LYING IN WAIT ON ENJOYMENT LIKE A
TIGER CROUCHED IN A JUNGLE
THE BREATHING OF THAT BEAST OF PREY WAS IN
MY EAR ALWAYS HIS FIERCE HEART PANTED CLOSE AGAINST MINE HE NEVER
STIRRED IN HIS LAIR BUT I FELT HIM I KNEW HE WAITED ONLY FOR SUN DOWN
TO BOUND RAVENOUS FROM HIS AMBUSH
I HAD HOPED WE MIGHT REACH VILLETTE ERE NIGHT SET IN AND THAT THUS I
MIGHT ESCAPE THE DEEPER EMBARRASSMENT WHICH OBSCURITY SEEMS TO THROW
ROUND A FIRST ARRIVAL AT AN UNKNOWN BOURNE BUT WHAT WITH OUR SLOW
PROGRESS AND LONG STOPPAGES WHAT WITH A THICK FOG AND SMALL DENSE
RAIN DARKNESS THAT MIGHT ALMOST BE FELT HAD SETTLED ON THE CITY BY
THE TIME WE GAINED ITS SUBURBS
I KNOW WE PASSED THROUGH A GATE WHERE SOLDIERS WERE STATIONED SO MUCH
I COULD SEE BY LAMPLIGHT THEN HAVING LEFT BEHIND US THE MIRY
CHAUSSE WE RATTLED OVER A PAVEMENT OF STRANGELY ROUGH AND FLINTY
SURFACE
AT A BUREAU THE DILIGENCE STOPPED AND THE PASSENGERS
ALIGHTED
MY FIRST BUSINESS WAS TO GET MY TRUNK A SMALL MATTER ENOUGH
BUT IMPORTANT TO ME
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS BEST NOT TO BE
IMPORTUNATE OR OVER EAGER ABOUT LUGGAGE BUT TO WAIT AND WATCH QUIETLY
THE DELIVERY OF OTHER BOXES TILL I SAW MY OWN AND THEN PROMPTLY CLAIM
AND SECURE IT I STOOD APART MY EYE FIXED ON THAT PART OF THE VEHICLE
IN WHICH I HAD SEEN MY LITTLE PORTMANTEAU SAFELY STOWED AND UPON WHICH
PILES OF ADDITIONAL BAGS AND BOXES WERE NOW HEAPED
ONE BY ONE I SAW
THESE REMOVED LOWERED AND SEIZED ON
I WAS SURE MINE OUGHT TO BE BY THIS TIME VISIBLE IT WAS NOT
I HAD
TIED ON THE DIRECTION CARD WITH A PIECE OF GREEN RIBBON THAT I MIGHT
KNOW IT AT A GLANCE NOT A FRINGE OR FRAGMENT OF GREEN WAS PERCEPTIBLE
EVERY PACKAGE WAS REMOVED EVERY TIN CASE AND BROWN PAPER PARCEL THE
OILCLOTH COVER WAS LIFTED I SAW WITH DISTINCT VISION THAT NOT AN
UMBRELLA CLOAK CANE HAT BOX OR BAND BOX REMAINED
AND MY PORTMANTEAU WITH MY FEW CLOTHES AND LITTLE POCKET BOOK
ENCLASPING THE REMNANT OF MY FIFTEEN POUNDS WHERE WERE THEY
I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW BUT I COULD NOT ASK IT THEN
I COULD SAY
NOTHING WHATEVER NOT POSSESSING A PHRASE OF SPEAKING FRENCH AND IT
WAS FRENCH AND FRENCH ONLY THE WHOLE WORLD SEEMED NOW GABBLING AROUND
ME
WHAT SHOULD I DO APPROACHING THE CONDUCTOR I JUST LAID MY HAND
ON HIS ARM POINTED TO A TRUNK THENCE TO THE DILIGENCE ROOF AND
TRIED TO EXPRESS A QUESTION WITH MY EYES
HE MISUNDERSTOOD ME SEIZED
THE TRUNK INDICATED AND WAS ABOUT TO HOIST IT ON THE VEHICLE
LET THAT ALONE WILL YOU SAID A VOICE IN GOOD ENGLISH THEN IN
CORRECTION QU'EST CE QUE VOUS FATES DONC CETTE MALLE EST MOI
BUT I HAD HEARD THE FATHERLAND ACCENTS THEY REJOICED MY HEART I
TURNED SIR SAID I APPEALING TO THE STRANGER WITHOUT IN MY
DISTRESS NOTICING WHAT HE WAS LIKE I CANNOT SPEAK FRENCH
MAY I
ENTREAT YOU TO ASK THIS MAN WHAT HE HAS DONE WITH MY TRUNK
WITHOUT DISCRIMINATING FOR THE MOMENT WHAT SORT OF FACE IT WAS TO
WHICH MY EYES WERE RAISED AND ON WHICH THEY WERE FIXED I FELT IN ITS
EXPRESSION HALF SURPRISE AT MY APPEAL AND HALF DOUBT OF THE WISDOM OF
INTERFERENCE
DO ASK HIM I WOULD DO AS MUCH FOR YOU SAID I
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE SMILED BUT HE SAID IN A GENTLEMANLY TONE THAT
IS TO SAY A TONE NOT HARD NOR TERRIFYING WHAT SORT OF TRUNK WAS
YOURS
I DESCRIBED IT INCLUDING IN MY DESCRIPTION THE GREEN RIBBON
AND
FORTHWITH HE TOOK THE CONDUCTOR UNDER HAND AND I FELT THROUGH ALL THE
STORM OF FRENCH WHICH FOLLOWED THAT HE RAKED HIM FORE AND AFT
PRESENTLY HE RETURNED TO ME
THE FELLOW AVERS HE WAS OVERLOADED AND CONFESSES THAT HE REMOVED YOUR
TRUNK AFTER YOU SAW IT PUT ON AND HAS LEFT IT BEHIND AT BOUE MARINE
WITH OTHER PARCELS HE HAS PROMISED HOWEVER TO FORWARD IT TO MORROW
THE DAY AFTER THEREFORE YOU WILL FIND IT SAFE AT THIS BUREAU
THANK YOU SAID I BUT MY HEART SANK
MEANTIME WHAT SHOULD I DO PERHAPS THIS ENGLISH GENTLEMAN SAW THE
FAILURE OF COURAGE IN MY FACE HE INQUIRED KINDLY HAVE YOU ANY
FRIENDS IN THIS CITY
NO AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO
THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF WHICH AS HE TURNED MORE
FULLY TO THE LIGHT OF A LAMP ABOVE HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS A YOUNG
DISTINGUISHED AND HANDSOME MAN HE MIGHT BE A LORD FOR ANYTHING I
KNEW NATURE HAD MADE HIM GOOD ENOUGH FOR A PRINCE I THOUGHT
HIS FACE
WAS VERY PLEASANT HE LOOKED HIGH BUT NOT ARROGANT MANLY BUT NOT
OVERBEARING
I WAS TURNING AWAY IN THE DEEP CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL
ABSENCE OF CLAIM TO LOOK FOR FURTHER HELP FROM SUCH A ONE AS HE
WAS ALL YOUR MONEY IN YOUR TRUNK HE ASKED STOPPING ME
HOW THANKFUL WAS I TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER WITH TRUTH NO
I HAVE ENOUGH
IN MY PURSE FOR I HAD NEAR TWENTY FRANCS TO KEEP ME AT A QUIET INN
TILL THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW BUT I AM QUITE A STRANGER IN VILLETTE
AND DON'T KNOW THE STREETS AND THE INNS
I CAN GIVE YOU THE ADDRESS OF SUCH AN INN AS YOU WANT SAID HE AND
IT IS NOT FAR OFF WITH MY DIRECTION YOU WILL EASILY FIND IT
HE TORE A LEAF FROM HIS POCKET BOOK WROTE A FEW WORDS AND GAVE IT TO
ME
I DID THINK HIM KIND AND AS TO DISTRUSTING HIM OR HIS ADVICE
OR HIS ADDRESS I SHOULD ALMOST AS SOON HAVE THOUGHT OF DISTRUSTING THE
BIBLE
THERE WAS GOODNESS IN HIS COUNTENANCE AND HONOUR IN HIS BRIGHT
EYES
YOUR SHORTEST WAY WILL BE TO FOLLOW THE BOULEVARD AND CROSS THE PARK
HE CONTINUED BUT IT IS TOO LATE AND TOO DARK FOR A WOMAN TO GO
THROUGH THE PARK ALONE I WILL STEP WITH YOU THUS FAR
HE MOVED ON AND I FOLLOWED HIM THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND THE SMALL
SOAKING RAIN
THE BOULEVARD WAS ALL DESERTED ITS PATH MIRY THE WATER
DRIPPING FROM ITS TREES THE PARK WAS BLACK AS MIDNIGHT
IN THE DOUBLE
GLOOM OF TREES AND FOG I COULD NOT SEE MY GUIDE I COULD ONLY FOLLOW
HIS TREAD
NOT THE LEAST FEAR HAD I I BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED
THAT FRANK TREAD THROUGH CONTINUAL NIGHT TO THE WORLD'S END
NOW SAID HE WHEN THE PARK WAS TRAVERSED YOU WILL GO ALONG THIS
BROAD STREET TILL YOU COME TO STEPS TWO LAMPS WILL SHOW YOU WHERE THEY
ARE THESE STEPS YOU WILL DESCEND A NARROWER STREET LIES BELOW
FOLLOWING THAT AT THE BOTTOM YOU WILL FIND YOUR INN
THEY SPEAK
ENGLISH THERE SO YOUR DIFFICULTIES ARE NOW PRETTY WELL OVER
GOOD NIGHT
GOOD NIGHT SIR SAID I ACCEPT MY SINCEREST THANKS AND WE PARTED
THE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS COUNTENANCE WHICH I AM SURE WORE A LIGHT NOT
UNBENIGNANT TO THE FRIENDLESS THE SOUND IN MY EAR OF HIS VOICE WHICH
SPOKE A NATURE CHIVALRIC TO THE NEEDY AND FEEBLE AS WELL AS THE
YOUTHFUL AND FAIR WERE A SORT OF CORDIAL TO ME LONG AFTER
HE WAS A
TRUE YOUNG ENGLISH GENTLEMAN
ON I WENT HURRYING FAST THROUGH A MAGNIFICENT STREET AND SQUARE WITH
THE GRANDEST HOUSES ROUND AND AMIDST THEM THE HUGE OUTLINE OF MORE
THAN ONE OVERBEARING PILE WHICH MIGHT BE PALACE OR CHURCH I COULD NOT
TELL
JUST AS I PASSED A PORTICO TWO MUSTACHIOED MEN CAME SUDDENLY
FROM BEHIND THE PILLARS THEY WERE SMOKING CIGARS THEIR DRESS IMPLIED
PRETENSIONS TO THE RANK OF GENTLEMEN BUT POOR THINGS THEY WERE VERY
PLEBEIAN IN SOUL
THEY SPOKE WITH INSOLENCE AND FAST AS I WALKED
THEY KEPT PACE WITH ME A LONG WAY
AT LAST I MET A SORT OF PATROL AND
MY DREADED HUNTERS WERE TURNED FROM THE PURSUIT BUT THEY HAD DRIVEN ME
BEYOND MY RECKONING WHEN I COULD COLLECT MY FACULTIES I NO LONGER
KNEW WHERE I WAS THE STAIRCASE I MUST LONG SINCE HAVE PASSED
PUZZLED
OUT OF BREATH ALL MY PULSES THROBBING IN INEVITABLE AGITATION I KNEW
NOT WHERE TO TURN
IT WAS TERRIBLE TO THINK OF AGAIN ENCOUNTERING THOSE
BEARDED SNEERING SIMPLETONS YET THE GROUND MUST BE RETRACED AND THE
STEPS SOUGHT OUT
I CAME AT LAST TO AN OLD AND WORN FLIGHT AND TAKING IT FOR GRANTED
THAT THIS MUST BE THE ONE INDICATED I DESCENDED THEM
THE STREET INTO
WHICH THEY LED WAS INDEED NARROW BUT IT CONTAINED NO INN
ON I
WANDERED
IN A VERY QUIET AND COMPARATIVELY CLEAN AND WELL PAVED
STREET I SAW A LIGHT BURNING OVER THE DOOR OF A RATHER LARGE HOUSE
LOFTIER BY A STORY THAN THOSE ROUND IT
THIS MIGHT BE THE INN AT
LAST
I HASTENED ON MY KNEES NOW TREMBLED UNDER ME I WAS GETTING
QUITE EXHAUSTED
NO INN WAS THIS
A BRASS PLATE EMBELLISHED THE GREAT PORTE COCHRE
PENSIONNAT DE DEMOISELLES WAS THE INSCRIPTION AND BENEATH A NAME
MADAME BECK
I STARTED
ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUGHTS VOLLEYED THROUGH MY MIND IN A
MOMENT
YET I PLANNED NOTHING AND CONSIDERED NOTHING I HAD NOT TIME
PROVIDENCE SAID STOP HERE THIS IS YOUR INN FATE TOOK ME IN HER
STRONG HAND MASTERED MY WILL DIRECTED MY ACTIONS I RANG THE
DOOR BELL
WHILE I WAITED I WOULD NOT REFLECT
I FIXEDLY LOOKED AT THE
STREET STONES WHERE THE DOOR LAMP SHONE AND COUNTED THEM AND NOTED
THEIR SHAPES AND THE GLITTER OF WET ON THEIR ANGLES
I RANG AGAIN
THEY OPENED AT LAST
A BONNE IN A SMART CAP STOOD BEFORE ME
MAY I SEE MADAME BECK I INQUIRED
I BELIEVE IF I HAD SPOKEN FRENCH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED ME BUT
AS I SPOKE ENGLISH SHE CONCLUDED I WAS A FOREIGN TEACHER COME ON
BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE PENSIONNAT AND EVEN AT THAT LATE HOUR
SHE LET ME IN WITHOUT A WORD OF RELUCTANCE OR A MOMENT OF HESITATION
THE NEXT MOMENT I SAT IN A COLD GLITTERING SALON WITH PORCELAIN
STOVE UNLIT AND GILDED ORNAMENTS AND POLISHED FLOOR
A PENDULE ON
THE MANTEL PIECE STRUCK NINE O'CLOCK
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR PASSED
HOW FAST BEAT EVERY PULSE IN MY FRAME HOW
I TURNED COLD AND HOT BY TURNS I SAT WITH MY EYES FIXED ON THE DOOR A
GREAT WHITE FOLDING DOOR WITH GILT MOULDINGS I WATCHED TO SEE A LEAF
MOVE AND OPEN
ALL HAD BEEN QUIET NOT A MOUSE HAD STIRRED THE WHITE
DOORS WERE CLOSED AND MOTIONLESS
YOU AYRE ENGLISS SAID A VOICE AT MY ELBOW
I ALMOST BOUNDED SO
UNEXPECTED WAS THE SOUND SO CERTAIN HAD I BEEN OF SOLITUDE
NO GHOST STOOD BESIDE ME NOR ANYTHING OF SPECTRAL ASPECT MERELY A
MOTHERLY DUMPY LITTLE WOMAN IN A LARGE SHAWL A WRAPPING GOWN AND A
CLEAN TRIM NIGHTCAP
I SAID I WAS ENGLISH AND IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT FURTHER PRELUDE WE FELL
TO A MOST REMARKABLE CONVERSATION
MADAME BECK FOR MADAME BECK IT
WAS SHE HAD ENTERED BY A LITTLE DOOR BEHIND ME AND BEING SHOD WITH
THE SHOES OF SILENCE I HAD HEARD NEITHER HER ENTRANCE NOR
APPROACH MADAME BECK HAD EXHAUSTED HER COMMAND OF INSULAR SPEECH WHEN
SHE SAID YOU AYRE ENGLISS AND SHE NOW PROCEEDED TO WORK AWAY
VOLUBLY IN HER OWN TONGUE
I ANSWERED IN MINE
SHE PARTLY UNDERSTOOD
ME BUT AS I DID NOT AT ALL UNDERSTAND HER THOUGH WE MADE TOGETHER AN
AWFUL CLAMOUR ANYTHING LIKE MADAME'S GIFT OF UTTERANCE I HAD NOT
HITHERTO HEARD OR IMAGINED WE ACHIEVED LITTLE PROGRESS
SHE RANG ERE
LONG FOR AID WHICH ARRIVED IN THE SHAPE OF A MATRESSE WHO HAD
BEEN PARTLY EDUCATED IN AN IRISH CONVENT AND WAS ESTEEMED A PERFECT
ADEPT IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
A BLUFF LITTLE PERSONAGE THIS MATRESSE
WAS LABASSECOURIENNE FROM TOP TO TOE AND HOW SHE DID SLAUGHTER THE
SPEECH OF ALBION HOWEVER I TOLD HER A PLAIN TALE WHICH SHE
TRANSLATED
I TOLD HER HOW I HAD LEFT MY OWN COUNTRY INTENT ON
EXTENDING MY KNOWLEDGE AND GAINING MY BREAD HOW I WAS READY TO TURN
MY HAND TO ANY USEFUL THING PROVIDED IT WAS NOT WRONG OR DEGRADING
HOW I WOULD BE A CHILD'S NURSE OR A LADY'S MAID AND WOULD NOT REFUSE
EVEN HOUSEWORK ADAPTED TO MY STRENGTH
MADAME HEARD THIS AND
QUESTIONING HER COUNTENANCE I ALMOST THOUGHT THE TALE WON HER EAR
IL N'Y A QUE LES ANGLAISES POUR CES SORTES D'ENTREPRISES SAID SHE
SONT ELLES DONC INTRPIDES CES FEMMES L
SHE ASKED MY NAME MY AGE SHE SAT AND LOOKED AT ME NOT PITYINGLY NOT
WITH INTEREST NEVER A GLEAM OF SYMPATHY OR A SHADE OF COMPASSION
CROSSED HER COUNTENANCE DURING THE INTERVIEW
I FELT SHE WAS NOT ONE TO
BE LED AN INCH BY HER FEELINGS GRAVE AND CONSIDERATE SHE GAZED
CONSULTING HER JUDGMENT AND STUDYING MY NARRATIVE
A BELL RANG
VOIL POUR LA PRIRE DU SOIR SAID SHE AND ROSE
THROUGH HER
INTERPRETER SHE DESIRED ME TO DEPART NOW AND COME BACK ON THE MORROW
BUT THIS DID NOT SUIT ME I COULD NOT BEAR TO RETURN TO THE PERILS OF
DARKNESS AND THE STREET
WITH ENERGY YET WITH A COLLECTED AND
CONTROLLED MANNER I SAID ADDRESSING HERSELF PERSONALLY AND NOT THE
MATRESSE BE ASSURED MADAME THAT BY INSTANTLY SECURING MY SERVICES
YOUR INTERESTS WILL BE SERVED AND NOT INJURED YOU WILL FIND ME ONE WHO
WILL WISH TO GIVE IN HER LABOUR A FULL EQUIVALENT FOR HER WAGES AND
IF YOU HIRE ME IT WILL BE BETTER THAT I SHOULD STAY HERE THIS NIGHT
HAVING NO ACQUAINTANCE IN VILLETTE AND NOT POSSESSING THE LANGUAGE OF
THE COUNTRY HOW CAN I SECURE A LODGING
IT IS TRUE SAID SHE BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN GIVE A REFERENCE
NONE
SHE INQUIRED AFTER MY LUGGAGE I TOLD HER WHEN IT WOULD ARRIVE
SHE
MUSED
AT THAT MOMENT A MAN'S STEP WAS HEARD IN THE VESTIBULE HASTILY
PROCEEDING TO THE OUTER DOOR
I SHALL GO ON WITH THIS PART OF MY TALE
AS IF I HAD UNDERSTOOD ALL THAT PASSED FOR THOUGH IT WAS THEN SCARCE
INTELLIGIBLE TO ME I HEARD IT TRANSLATED AFTERWARDS
WHO GOES OUT NOW DEMANDED MADAME BECK LISTENING TO THE TREAD
M
PAUL REPLIED THE TEACHER
HE CAME THIS EVENING TO GIVE A READING
TO THE FIRST CLASS
THE VERY MAN I SHOULD AT THIS MOMENT MOST WISH TO SEE
CALL HIM
THE TEACHER RAN TO THE SALON DOOR
M
PAUL WAS SUMMONED
HE ENTERED A
SMALL DARK AND SPARE MAN IN SPECTACLES
MON COUSIN BEGAN MADAME I WANT YOUR OPINION
WE KNOW YOUR SKILL IN
PHYSIOGNOMY USE IT NOW
READ THAT COUNTENANCE
THE LITTLE MAN FIXED ON ME HIS SPECTACLES A RESOLUTE COMPRESSION OF
THE LIPS AND GATHERING OF THE BROW SEEMED TO SAY THAT HE MEANT TO SEE
THROUGH ME AND THAT A VEIL WOULD BE NO VEIL FOR HIM
I READ IT HE PRONOUNCED
ET QU'EN DITES VOUS
MAIS BIEN DES CHOSES WAS THE ORACULAR ANSWER
BAD OR GOOD
OF EACH KIND WITHOUT DOUBT PURSUED THE DIVINER
MAY ONE TRUST HER WORD
ARE YOU NEGOTIATING A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE
SHE WISHES ME TO ENGAGE HER AS BONNE OR GOUVERNANTE TELLS A TALE FULL
OF INTEGRITY BUT GIVES NO REFERENCE
SHE IS A STRANGER
AN ENGLISHWOMAN AS ONE MAY SEE
SHE SPEAKS FRENCH
NOT A WORD
SHE UNDERSTANDS IT
NO
ONE MAY THEN SPEAK PLAINLY IN HER PRESENCE
DOUBTLESS
HE GAZED STEADILY
DO YOU NEED HER SERVICES
I COULD DO WITH THEM
YOU KNOW I AM DISGUSTED WITH MADAME SVINI
STILL HE SCRUTINIZED
THE JUDGMENT WHEN IT AT LAST CAME WAS AS
INDEFINITE AS WHAT HAD GONE BEFORE IT
ENGAGE HER
IF GOOD PREDOMINATES IN THAT NATURE THE ACTION WILL BRING
ITS OWN REWARD IF EVIL EH BIEN MA COUSINE CE SERA TOUJOURS UNE
BONNE OEUVRE AND WITH A BOW AND A BON SOIR THIS VAGUE ARBITER OF
MY DESTINY VANISHED
AND MADAME DID ENGAGE ME THAT VERY NIGHT BY GOD'S BLESSING I WAS
SPARED THE NECESSITY OF PASSING FORTH AGAIN INTO THE LONESOME DREARY
HOSTILE STREET
CHAPTER VIII
MADAME BECK
BEING DELIVERED INTO THE CHARGE OF THE MATRESSE I WAS LED THROUGH A
LONG NARROW PASSAGE INTO A FOREIGN KITCHEN VERY CLEAN BUT VERY
STRANGE
IT SEEMED TO CONTAIN NO MEANS OF COOKING NEITHER FIREPLACE
NOR OVEN I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE GREAT BLACK FURNACE WHICH
FILLED ONE CORNER WAS AN EFFICIENT SUBSTITUTE FOR THESE
SURELY PRIDE
WAS NOT ALREADY BEGINNING ITS WHISPERS IN MY HEART YET I FELT A SENSE
OF RELIEF WHEN INSTEAD OF BEING LEFT IN THE KITCHEN AS I HALF
ANTICIPATED I WAS LED FORWARD TO A SMALL INNER ROOM TERMED A
CABINET A COOK IN A JACKET A SHORT PETTICOAT AND SABOTS BROUGHT MY
SUPPER TO WIT SOME MEAT NATURE UNKNOWN SERVED IN AN ODD AND ACID
BUT PLEASANT SAUCE SOME CHOPPED POTATOES MADE SAVOURY WITH I KNOW
NOT WHAT VINEGAR AND SUGAR I THINK A TARTINE OR SLICE OF BREAD AND
BUTTER AND A BAKED PEAR
BEING HUNGRY I ATE AND WAS GRATEFUL
AFTER THE PRIRE DU SOIR MADAME HERSELF CAME TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT
ME
SHE DESIRED ME TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
THROUGH A SERIES OF THE
QUEEREST LITTLE DORMITORIES WHICH I HEARD AFTERWARDS HAD ONCE BEEN
NUNS' CELLS FOR THE PREMISES WERE IN PART OF ANCIENT DATE AND THROUGH
THE ORATORY A LONG LOW GLOOMY ROOM WHERE A CRUCIFIX HUNG PALE
AGAINST THE WALL AND TWO TAPERS KEPT DIM VIGILS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO
AN APARTMENT WHERE THREE CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP IN THREE TINY BEDS
A
HEATED STOVE MADE THE AIR OF THIS ROOM OPPRESSIVE AND TO MEND
MATTERS IT WAS SCENTED WITH AN ODOUR RATHER STRONG THAN DELICATE A
PERFUME INDEED ALTOGETHER SURPRISING AND UNEXPECTED UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES BEING LIKE THE COMBINATION OF SMOKE WITH SOME SPIRITUOUS
ESSENCE A SMELL IN SHORT OF WHISKY
BESIDE A TABLE ON WHICH FLARED THE REMNANT OF A CANDLE GUTTERING TO
WASTE IN THE SOCKET A COARSE WOMAN HETEROGENEOUSLY CLAD IN A BROAD
STRIPED SHOWY SILK DRESS AND A STUFF APRON SAT IN A CHAIR FAST
ASLEEP
TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE AND LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO THE STATE OF
MATTERS A BOTTLE AND AN EMPTY GLASS STOOD AT THE SLEEPING BEAUTY'S
ELBOW
MADAME CONTEMPLATED THIS REMARKABLE TABLEAU WITH GREAT CALM SHE
NEITHER SMILED NOR SCOWLED NO IMPRESS OF ANGER DISGUST OR SURPRISE
RUFFLED THE EQUALITY OF HER GRAVE ASPECT SHE DID NOT EVEN WAKE THE
WOMAN SERENELY POINTING TO A FOURTH BED SHE INTIMATED THAT IT WAS TO
BE MINE THEN HAVING EXTINGUISHED THE CANDLE AND SUBSTITUTED FOR IT A
NIGHT LAMP SHE GLIDED THROUGH AN INNER DOOR WHICH SHE LEFT AJAR THE
ENTRANCE TO HER OWN CHAMBER A LARGE WELL FURNISHED APARTMENT AS WAS
DISCERNIBLE THROUGH THE APERTURE
MY DEVOTIONS THAT NIGHT WERE ALL THANKSGIVING
STRANGELY HAD I BEEN LED
SINCE MORNING UNEXPECTEDLY HAD I BEEN PROVIDED FOR
SCARCELY COULD I
BELIEVE THAT NOT FORTY EIGHT HOURS HAD ELAPSED SINCE I LEFT LONDON
UNDER NO OTHER GUARDIANSHIP THAN THAT WHICH PROTECTS THE
PASSENGER BIRD WITH NO PROSPECT BUT THE DUBIOUS CLOUD TRACERY OF HOPE
I WAS A LIGHT SLEEPER IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT I SUDDENLY AWOKE
ALL WAS
HUSHED BUT A WHITE FIGURE STOOD IN THE ROOM MADAME IN HER
NIGHT DRESS
MOVING WITHOUT PERCEPTIBLE SOUND SHE VISITED THE THREE
CHILDREN IN THE THREE BEDS SHE APPROACHED ME I FEIGNED SLEEP AND SHE
STUDIED ME LONG
A SMALL PANTOMIME ENSUED CURIOUS ENOUGH
I DARESAY
SHE SAT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR ON THE EDGE OF MY BED GAZING AT MY FACE
SHE THEN DREW NEARER BENT CLOSE OVER ME SLIGHTLY RAISED MY CAP AND
TURNED BACK THE BORDER SO AS TO EXPOSE MY HAIR SHE LOOKED AT MY HAND
LYING ON THE BEDCLOTHES
THIS DONE SHE TURNED TO THE CHAIR WHERE MY
CLOTHES LAY IT WAS AT THE FOOT OF THE BED
HEARING HER TOUCH AND LIFT
THEM I OPENED MY EYES WITH PRECAUTION FOR I OWN I FELT CURIOUS TO SEE
HOW FAR HER TASTE FOR RESEARCH WOULD LEAD HER
IT LED HER A GOOD WAY
EVERY ARTICLE DID SHE INSPECT
I DIVINED HER MOTIVE FOR THIS
PROCEEDING VIZ
THE WISH TO FORM FROM THE GARMENTS A JUDGMENT
RESPECTING THE WEARER HER STATION MEANS NEATNESS C
THE END WAS
NOT BAD BUT THE MEANS WERE HARDLY FAIR OR JUSTIFIABLE
IN MY DRESS WAS
A POCKET SHE FAIRLY TURNED IT INSIDE OUT SHE COUNTED THE MONEY IN MY
PURSE SHE OPENED A LITTLE MEMORANDUM BOOK COOLLY PERUSED ITS
CONTENTS AND TOOK FROM BETWEEN THE LEAVES A SMALL PLAITED LOCK OF MISS
MARCHMONT'S GREY HAIR
TO A BUNCH OF THREE KEYS BEING THOSE OF MY
TRUNK DESK AND WORK BOX SHE ACCORDED SPECIAL ATTENTION WITH THESE
INDEED SHE WITHDREW A MOMENT TO HER OWN ROOM
I SOFTLY ROSE IN MY BED
AND FOLLOWED HER WITH MY EYE THESE KEYS READER WERE NOT BROUGHT BACK
TILL THEY HAD LEFT ON THE TOILET OF THE ADJOINING ROOM THE IMPRESS OF
THEIR WARDS IN WAX
ALL BEING THUS DONE DECENTLY AND IN ORDER MY
PROPERTY WAS RETURNED TO ITS PLACE MY CLOTHES WERE CAREFULLY REFOLDED
OF WHAT NATURE WERE THE CONCLUSIONS DEDUCED FROM THIS SCRUTINY WERE
THEY FAVOURABLE OR OTHERWISE VAIN QUESTION
MADAME'S FACE OF STONE
FOR OF STONE IN ITS PRESENT NIGHT ASPECT IT LOOKED IT HAD BEEN HUMAN
AND AS I SAID BEFORE MOTHERLY IN THE SALON BETRAYED NO RESPONSE
HER DUTY DONE I FELT THAT IN HER EYES THIS BUSINESS WAS A DUTY SHE
ROSE NOISELESS AS A SHADOW SHE MOVED TOWARDS HER OWN CHAMBER AT THE
DOOR SHE TURNED FIXING HER EYE ON THE HEROINE OF THE BOTTLE WHO
STILL SLEPT AND LOUDLY SNORED
MRS
SVINI I PRESUME THIS WAS MRS
SVINI ANGLIC OR HIBERNIC SWEENY MRS
SWEENY'S DOOM WAS IN MADAME
BECK'S EYE AN IMMUTABLE PURPOSE THAT EYE SPOKE MADAME'S VISITATIONS
FOR SHORTCOMINGS MIGHT BE SLOW BUT THEY WERE SURE
ALL THIS WAS VERY
UN ENGLISH TRULY I WAS IN A FOREIGN LAND
THE MORROW MADE ME FURTHER ACQUAINTED WITH MRS
SWEENY
IT SEEMS SHE
HAD INTRODUCED HERSELF TO HER PRESENT EMPLOYER AS AN ENGLISH LADY IN
REDUCED CIRCUMSTANCES A NATIVE INDEED OF MIDDLESEX PROFESSING TO
SPEAK THE ENGLISH TONGUE WITH THE PUREST METROPOLITAN ACCENT
MADAME RELIANT ON HER OWN INFALLIBLE EXPEDIENTS FOR FINDING OUT THE
TRUTH IN TIME HAD A SINGULAR INTREPIDITY IN HIRING SERVICE OFF HAND
AS INDEED SEEMED ABUNDANTLY PROVED IN MY OWN CASE
SHE RECEIVED MRS
SWEENY AS NURSERY GOVERNESS TO HER THREE CHILDREN
I NEED HARDLY
EXPLAIN TO THE READER THAT THIS LADY WAS IN EFFECT A NATIVE OF IRELAND
HER STATION I DO NOT PRETEND TO FIX SHE BOLDLY DECLARED THAT SHE HAD
HAD THE BRINGING UP OF THE SON AND DAUGHTER OF A MARQUIS I THINK
MYSELF SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A HANGER ON NURSE FOSTERER OR
WASHERWOMAN IN SOME IRISH FAMILY SHE SPOKE A SMOTHERED TONGUE
CURIOUSLY OVERLAID WITH MINCING COCKNEY INFLECTIONS
BY SOME MEANS OR
OTHER SHE HAD ACQUIRED AND NOW HELD IN POSSESSION A WARDROBE OF
RATHER SUSPICIOUS SPLENDOUR GOWNS OF STIFF AND COSTLY SILK FITTING
HER INDIFFERENTLY AND APPARENTLY MADE FOR OTHER PROPORTIONS THAN THOSE
THEY NOW ADORNED CAPS WITH REAL LACE BORDERS AND THE CHIEF ITEM IN
THE INVENTORY THE SPELL BY WHICH SHE STRUCK A CERTAIN AWE THROUGH THE
HOUSEHOLD QUELLING THE OTHERWISE SCORNFULLY DISPOSED TEACHERS AND
SERVANTS AND SO LONG AS HER BROAD SHOULDERS WORE THE FOLDS OF THAT
MAJESTIC DRAPERY EVEN INFLUENCING MADAME HERSELF A REAL INDIAN
SHAWL UN VRITABLE CACHEMIRE AS MADAME BECK SAID WITH UNMIXED
REVERENCE AND AMAZE
I FEEL QUITE SURE THAT WITHOUT THIS CACHEMIRE
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE KEPT HER FOOTING IN THE PENSIONNAT FOR TWO DAYS BY
VIRTUE OF IT AND IT ONLY SHE MAINTAINED THE SAME A MONTH
BUT WHEN MRS
SWEENY KNEW THAT I WAS COME TO FILL HER SHOES THEN IT
WAS THAT SHE DECLARED HERSELF THEN DID SHE RISE ON MADAME BECK IN HER
FULL POWER THEN COME DOWN ON ME WITH HER CONCENTRATED WEIGHT
MADAME
BORE THIS REVELATION AND VISITATION SO WELL SO STOICALLY THAT I FOR
VERY SHAME COULD NOT SUPPORT IT OTHERWISE THAN WITH COMPOSURE
FOR ONE
LITTLE MOMENT MADAME BECK ABSENTED HERSELF FROM THE ROOM TEN MINUTES
AFTER AN AGENT OF THE POLICE STOOD IN THE MIDST OF US
MRS
SWEENY AND
HER EFFECTS WERE REMOVED
MADAME'S BROW HAD NOT BEEN RUFFLED DURING THE
SCENE HER LIPS HAD NOT DROPPED ONE SHARPLY ACCENTED WORD
THIS BRISK LITTLE AFFAIR OF THE DISMISSAL WAS ALL SETTLED BEFORE
BREAKFAST ORDER TO MARCH GIVEN POLICEMAN CALLED MUTINEER EXPELLED
CHAMBRE D'ENFANS FUMIGATED AND CLEANSED WINDOWS THROWN OPEN AND
EVERY TRACE OF THE ACCOMPLISHED MRS
SWEENY EVEN TO THE FINE ESSENCE
AND SPIRITUAL FRAGRANCE WHICH GAVE TOKEN SO SUBTLE AND SO FATAL OF THE
HEAD AND FRONT OF HER OFFENDING WAS ANNIHILATED FROM THE RUE FOSSETTE
ALL THIS I SAY WAS DONE BETWEEN THE MOMENT OF MADAME BECK'S ISSUING
LIKE AURORA FROM HER CHAMBER AND THAT IN WHICH SHE COOLLY SAT DOWN TO
POUR OUT HER FIRST CUP OF COFFEE
ABOUT NOON I WAS SUMMONED TO DRESS MADAME
IT APPEARED MY PLACE WAS
TO BE A HYBRID BETWEEN GOUVERNANTE AND LADY'S MAID TILL NOON SHE
HAUNTED THE HOUSE IN HER WRAPPING GOWN SHAWL AND SOUNDLESS SLIPPERS
HOW WOULD THE LADY CHIEF OF AN ENGLISH SCHOOL APPROVE THIS CUSTOM
THE DRESSING OF HER HAIR PUZZLED ME SHE HAD PLENTY OF IT AUBURN
UNMIXED WITH GREY THOUGH SHE WAS FORTY YEARS OLD
SEEING MY
EMBARRASSMENT SHE SAID YOU HAVE NOT BEEN A FEMME DE CHAMBRE IN YOUR
OWN COUNTRY AND TAKING THE BRUSH FROM MY HAND AND SETTING ME ASIDE
NOT UNGENTLY OR DISRESPECTFULLY SHE ARRANGED IT HERSELF
IN PERFORMING
OTHER OFFICES OF THE TOILET SHE HALF DIRECTED HALF AIDED ME WITHOUT
THE LEAST DISPLAY OF TEMPER OR IMPATIENCE
N B THAT WAS THE FIRST AND
LAST TIME I WAS REQUIRED TO DRESS HER
HENCEFORTH ON ROSINE THE
PORTRESS DEVOLVED THAT DUTY
WHEN ATTIRED MADAME BECK APPEARED A PERSONAGE OF A FIGURE RATHER SHORT
AND STOUT YET STILL GRACEFUL IN ITS OWN PECULIAR WAY THAT IS WITH
THE GRACE RESULTING FROM PROPORTION OF PARTS
HER COMPLEXION WAS FRESH
AND SANGUINE NOT TOO RUBICUND HER EYE BLUE AND SERENE HER DARK SILK
DRESS FITTED HER AS A FRENCH SEMPSTRESS ALONE CAN MAKE A DRESS FIT SHE
LOOKED WELL THOUGH A LITTLE BOURGEOISE AS BOURGEOISE INDEED SHE
WAS
I KNOW NOT WHAT OF HARMONY PERVADED HER WHOLE PERSON AND YET HER
FACE OFFERED CONTRAST TOO ITS FEATURES WERE BY NO MEANS SUCH AS ARE
USUALLY SEEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH A COMPLEXION OF SUCH BLENDED FRESHNESS
AND REPOSE THEIR OUTLINE WAS STERN HER FOREHEAD WAS HIGH BUT NARROW
IT EXPRESSED CAPACITY AND SOME BENEVOLENCE BUT NO EXPANSE NOR DID HER
PEACEFUL YET WATCHFUL EYE EVER KNOW THE FIRE WHICH IS KINDLED IN THE
HEART OR THE SOFTNESS WHICH FLOWS THENCE
HER MOUTH WAS HARD IT COULD
BE A LITTLE GRIM HER LIPS WERE THIN
FOR SENSIBILITY AND GENIUS WITH
ALL THEIR TENDERNESS AND TEMERITY I FELT SOMEHOW THAT MADAME WOULD BE
THE RIGHT SORT OF MINOS IN PETTICOATS
IN THE LONG RUN I FOUND SHE WAS SOMETHING ELSE IN PETTICOATS TOO
HER
NAME WAS MODESTE MARIA BECK NE KINT IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN IGNACIA
SHE WAS A CHARITABLE WOMAN AND DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD
THERE NEVER
WAS A MISTRESS WHOSE RULE WAS MILDER
I WAS TOLD THAT SHE NEVER ONCE
REMONSTRATED WITH THE INTOLERABLE MRS
SWEENY DESPITE HER TIPSINESS
DISORDER AND GENERAL NEGLECT YET MRS
SWEENY HAD TO GO THE MOMENT HER
DEPARTURE BECAME CONVENIENT
I WAS TOLD TOO THAT NEITHER MASTERS NOR
TEACHERS WERE FOUND FAULT WITH IN THAT ESTABLISHMENT YET BOTH MASTERS
AND TEACHERS WERE OFTEN CHANGED THEY VANISHED AND OTHERS FILLED THEIR
PLACES NONE COULD WELL EXPLAIN HOW
THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS BOTH A PENSIONNAT AND AN EXTERNAT THE EXTERNES
OR DAY PUPILS EXCEEDED ONE HUNDRED IN NUMBER THE BOARDERS WERE ABOUT A
SCORE
MADAME MUST HAVE POSSESSED HIGH ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS SHE RULED
ALL THESE TOGETHER WITH FOUR TEACHERS EIGHT MASTERS SIX SERVANTS
AND THREE CHILDREN MANAGING AT THE SAME TIME TO PERFECTION THE PUPILS'
PARENTS AND FRIENDS AND THAT WITHOUT APPARENT EFFORT WITHOUT BUSTLE
FATIGUE FEVER OR ANY SYMPTOM OF UNDUE EXCITEMENT OCCUPIED SHE
ALWAYS WAS BUSY RARELY
IT IS TRUE THAT MADAME HAD HER OWN SYSTEM FOR
MANAGING AND REGULATING THIS MASS OF MACHINERY AND A VERY PRETTY
SYSTEM IT WAS THE READER HAS SEEN A SPECIMEN OF IT IN THAT SMALL
AFFAIR OF TURNING MY POCKET INSIDE OUT AND READING MY PRIVATE
MEMORANDA
SURVEILLANCE ESPIONAGE THESE WERE HER WATCHWORDS
STILL MADAME KNEW WHAT HONESTY WAS AND LIKED IT THAT IS WHEN IT DID
NOT OBTRUDE ITS CLUMSY SCRUPLES IN THE WAY OF HER WILL AND INTEREST
SHE HAD A RESPECT FOR ANGLETERRE AND AS TO LES ANGLAISES SHE
WOULD HAVE THE WOMEN OF NO OTHER COUNTRY ABOUT HER OWN CHILDREN IF SHE
COULD HELP IT
OFTEN IN THE EVENING AFTER SHE HAD BEEN PLOTTING AND COUNTER PLOTTING
SPYING AND RECEIVING THE REPORTS OF SPIES ALL DAY SHE WOULD COME UP TO
MY ROOM A TRACE OF REAL WEARINESS ON HER BROW AND SHE WOULD SIT DOWN
AND LISTEN WHILE THE CHILDREN SAID THEIR LITTLE PRAYERS TO ME IN
ENGLISH THE LORD'S PRAYER AND THE HYMN BEGINNING GENTLE JESUS
THESE LITTLE CATHOLICS WERE PERMITTED TO REPEAT AT MY KNEE AND WHEN I
HAD PUT THEM TO BED SHE WOULD TALK TO ME I SOON GAINED ENOUGH FRENCH
TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND EVEN ANSWER HER ABOUT ENGLAND AND
ENGLISHWOMEN AND THE REASONS FOR WHAT SHE WAS PLEASED TO TERM THEIR
SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE AND MORE REAL AND RELIABLE PROBITY
VERY GOOD
SENSE SHE OFTEN SHOWED VERY SOUND OPINIONS SHE OFTEN BROACHED SHE
SEEMED TO KNOW THAT KEEPING GIRLS IN DISTRUSTFUL RESTRAINT IN BLIND
IGNORANCE AND UNDER A SURVEILLANCE THAT LEFT THEM NO MOMENT AND NO
CORNER FOR RETIREMENT WAS NOT THE BEST WAY TO MAKE THEM GROW UP HONEST
AND MODEST WOMEN BUT SHE AVERRED THAT RUINOUS CONSEQUENCES WOULD ENSUE
IF ANY OTHER METHOD WERE TRIED WITH CONTINENTAL CHILDREN THEY WERE SO
ACCUSTOMED TO RESTRAINT THAT RELAXATION HOWEVER GUARDED WOULD BE
MISUNDERSTOOD AND FATALLY PRESUMED ON
SHE WAS SICK SHE WOULD DECLARE
OF THE MEANS SHE HAD TO USE BUT USE THEM SHE MUST AND AFTER
DISCOURSING OFTEN WITH DIGNITY AND DELICACY TO ME SHE WOULD MOVE
AWAY ON HER SOULIERS DE SILENCE AND GLIDE GHOST LIKE THROUGH THE
HOUSE WATCHING AND SPYING EVERYWHERE PEERING THROUGH EVERY KEYHOLE
LISTENING BEHIND EVERY DOOR
AFTER ALL MADAME'S SYSTEM WAS NOT BAD LET ME DO HER JUSTICE
NOTHING
COULD BE BETTER THAN ALL HER ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE PHYSICAL WELL BEING
OF HER SCHOLARS
NO MINDS WERE OVERTASKED THE LESSONS WERE WELL
DISTRIBUTED AND MADE INCOMPARABLY EASY TO THE LEARNER THERE WAS A
LIBERTY OF AMUSEMENT AND A PROVISION FOR EXERCISE WHICH KEPT THE GIRLS
HEALTHY THE FOOD WAS ABUNDANT AND GOOD NEITHER PALE NOR PUNY FACES
WERE ANYWHERE TO BE SEEN IN THE RUE FOSSETTE
SHE NEVER GRUDGED A
HOLIDAY SHE ALLOWED PLENTY OF TIME FOR SLEEPING DRESSING WASHING
EATING HER METHOD IN ALL THESE MATTERS WAS EASY LIBERAL SALUTARY
AND RATIONAL MANY AN AUSTERE ENGLISH SCHOOL MISTRESS WOULD DO VASTLY
WELL TO IMITATE HER AND I BELIEVE MANY WOULD BE GLAD TO DO SO IF
EXACTING ENGLISH PARENTS WOULD LET THEM
AS MADAME BECK RULED BY ESPIONAGE SHE OF COURSE HAD HER STAFF OF
SPIES SHE PERFECTLY KNEW THE QUALITY OF THE TOOLS SHE USED AND WHILE
SHE WOULD NOT SCRUPLE TO HANDLE THE DIRTIEST FOR A DIRTY
OCCASION FLINGING THIS SORT FROM HER LIKE REFUSE RIND AFTER THE
ORANGE HAS BEEN DULY SQUEEZED I HAVE KNOWN HER FASTIDIOUS IN SEEKING
PURE METAL FOR CLEAN USES AND WHEN ONCE A BLOODLESS AND RUSTLESS
INSTRUMENT WAS FOUND SHE WAS CAREFUL OF THE PRIZE KEEPING IT IN SILK
AND COTTON WOOL
YET WOE BE TO THAT MAN OR WOMAN WHO RELIED ON HER ONE
INCH BEYOND THE POINT WHERE IT WAS HER INTEREST TO BE TRUSTWORTHY
INTEREST WAS THE MASTER KEY OF MADAME'S NATURE THE MAINSPRING OF HER
MOTIVES THE ALPHA AND OMEGA OF HER LIFE
I HAVE SEEN HER FEELINGS
APPEALED TO AND I HAVE SMILED IN HALF PITY HALF SCORN AT THE
APPELLANTS
NONE EVER GAINED HER EAR THROUGH THAT CHANNEL OR SWAYED
HER PURPOSE BY THAT MEANS
ON THE CONTRARY TO ATTEMPT TO TOUCH HER
HEART WAS THE SUREST WAY TO ROUSE HER ANTIPATHY AND TO MAKE OF HER A
SECRET FOE
IT PROVED TO HER THAT SHE HAD NO HEART TO BE TOUCHED IT
REMINDED HER WHERE SHE WAS IMPOTENT AND DEAD
NEVER WAS THE DISTINCTION
BETWEEN CHARITY AND MERCY BETTER EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN HER
WHILE DEVOID
OF SYMPATHY SHE HAD A SUFFICIENCY OF RATIONAL BENEVOLENCE SHE WOULD
GIVE IN THE READIEST MANNER TO PEOPLE SHE HAD NEVER SEEN RATHER
HOWEVER TO CLASSES THAN TO INDIVIDUALS
POUR LES PAUVRES SHE OPENED
HER PURSE FREELY AGAINST THE POOR MAN AS A RULE SHE KEPT IT
CLOSED
IN PHILANTHROPIC SCHEMES FOR THE BENEFIT OF SOCIETY AT LARGE
SHE TOOK A CHEERFUL PART NO PRIVATE SORROW TOUCHED HER NO FORCE OR
MASS OF SUFFERING CONCENTRATED IN ONE HEART HAD POWER TO PIERCE HERS
NOT THE AGONY IN GETHSEMANE NOT THE DEATH ON CALVARY COULD HAVE WRUNG
FROM HER EYES ONE TEAR
I SAY AGAIN MADAME WAS A VERY GREAT AND A VERY CAPABLE WOMAN
THAT
SCHOOL OFFERED HER FOR HER POWERS TOO LIMITED A SPHERE SHE OUGHT TO
HAVE SWAYED A NATION SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LEADER OF A TURBULENT
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
NOBODY COULD HAVE BROWBEATEN HER NONE IRRITATED
HER NERVES EXHAUSTED HER PATIENCE OR OVER REACHED HER ASTUTENESS
IN
HER OWN SINGLE PERSON SHE COULD HAVE COMPRISED THE DUTIES OF A FIRST
MINISTER AND A SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE
WISE FIRM FAITHLESS SECRET
CRAFTY PASSIONLESS WATCHFUL AND INSCRUTABLE ACUTE AND
INSENSATE WITHAL PERFECTLY DECOROUS WHAT MORE COULD BE DESIRED
THE SENSIBLE READER WILL NOT SUPPOSE THAT I GAINED ALL THE KNOWLEDGE
HERE CONDENSED FOR HIS BENEFIT IN ONE MONTH OR IN ONE HALF YEAR
NO
WHAT I SAW AT FIRST WAS THE THRIVING OUTSIDE OF A LARGE AND FLOURISHING
EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT
HERE WAS A GREAT HOUSE FULL OF HEALTHY
LIVELY GIRLS ALL WELL DRESSED AND MANY OF THEM HANDSOME GAINING
KNOWLEDGE BY A MARVELLOUSLY EASY METHOD WITHOUT PAINFUL EXERTION OR
USELESS WASTE OF SPIRITS NOT PERHAPS MAKING VERY RAPID PROGRESS IN
ANYTHING TAKING IT EASY BUT STILL ALWAYS EMPLOYED AND NEVER
OPPRESSED
HERE WAS A CORPS OF TEACHERS AND MASTERS MORE STRINGENTLY
TASKED AS ALL THE REAL HEAD LABOUR WAS TO BE DONE BY THEM IN ORDER TO
SAVE THE PUPILS YET HAVING THEIR DUTIES SO ARRANGED THAT THEY RELIEVED
EACH OTHER IN QUICK SUCCESSION WHENEVER THE WORK WAS SEVERE HERE IN
SHORT WAS A FOREIGN SCHOOL OF WHICH THE LIFE MOVEMENT AND VARIETY
MADE IT A COMPLETE AND MOST CHARMING CONTRAST TO MANY ENGLISH
INSTITUTIONS OF THE SAME KIND
BEHIND THE HOUSE WAS A LARGE GARDEN AND IN SUMMER THE PUPILS ALMOST
LIVED OUT OF DOORS AMONGST THE ROSE BUSHES AND THE FRUIT TREES
UNDER
THE VAST AND VINE DRAPED BERCEAU MADAME WOULD TAKE HER SEAT ON SUMMER
AFTERNOONS AND SEND FOR THE CLASSES IN TURNS TO SIT ROUND HER AND
SEW AND READ
MEANTIME MASTERS CAME AND WENT DELIVERING SHORT AND
LIVELY LECTURES RATHER THAN LESSONS AND THE PUPILS MADE NOTES OF
THEIR INSTRUCTIONS OR DID NOT MAKE THEM JUST AS INCLINATION
PROMPTED SECURE THAT IN CASE OF NEGLECT THEY COULD COPY THE NOTES OF
THEIR COMPANIONS
BESIDES THE REGULAR MONTHLY JOURS DE SORTIE THE
CATHOLIC FTE DAYS BROUGHT A SUCCESSION OF HOLIDAYS ALL THE YEAR ROUND
AND SOMETIMES ON A BRIGHT SUMMER MORNING OR SOFT SUMMER EVENING THE
BOARDERS WERE TAKEN OUT FOR A LONG WALK INTO THE COUNTRY REGALED WITH
GAUFRES AND VIN BLANC OR NEW MILK AND PAIN BIS OR PISTOLETS AU
BEURRE ROLLS AND COFFEE
ALL THIS SEEMED VERY PLEASANT AND MADAME
APPEARED GOODNESS ITSELF AND THE TEACHERS NOT SO BAD BUT THEY MIGHT BE
WORSE AND THE PUPILS PERHAPS A LITTLE NOISY AND ROUGH BUT TYPES OF
HEALTH AND GLEE
THUS DID THE VIEW APPEAR SEEN THROUGH THE ENCHANTMENT OF DISTANCE BUT
THERE CAME A TIME WHEN DISTANCE WAS TO MELT FOR ME WHEN I WAS TO BE
CALLED DOWN FROM MY WATCH TOWER OF THE NURSERY WHENCE I HAD HITHERTO
MADE MY OBSERVATIONS AND WAS TO BE COMPELLED INTO CLOSER INTERCOURSE
WITH THIS LITTLE WORLD OF THE RUE FOSSETTE
I WAS ONE DAY SITTING UP STAIRS AS USUAL HEARING THE CHILDREN THEIR
ENGLISH LESSONS AND AT THE SAME TIME TURNING A SILK DRESS FOR MADAME
WHEN SHE CAME SAUNTERING INTO THE ROOM WITH THAT ABSORBED AIR AND BROW
OF HARD THOUGHT SHE SOMETIMES WORE AND WHICH MADE HER LOOK SO LITTLE
GENIAL
DROPPING INTO A SEAT OPPOSITE MINE SHE REMAINED SOME MINUTES
SILENT
DSIRE THE ELDEST GIRL WAS READING TO ME SOME LITTLE ESSAY
OF MRS
BARBAULD'S AND I WAS MAKING HER TRANSLATE CURRENTLY FROM
ENGLISH TO FRENCH AS SHE PROCEEDED BY WAY OF ASCERTAINING THAT SHE
COMPREHENDED WHAT SHE READ MADAME LISTENED
PRESENTLY WITHOUT PREFACE OR PRELUDE SHE SAID ALMOST IN THE TONE OF
ONE MAKING AN ACCUSATION MEESS IN ENGLAND YOU WERE A GOVERNESS
NO MADAME SAID I SMILING YOU ARE MISTAKEN
IS THIS YOUR FIRST ESSAY AT TEACHING THIS ATTEMPT WITH MY CHILDREN
I ASSURED HER IT WAS
AGAIN SHE BECAME SILENT BUT LOOKING UP AS I
TOOK A PIN FROM THE CUSHION I FOUND MYSELF AN OBJECT OF STUDY SHE
HELD ME UNDER HER EYE SHE SEEMED TURNING ME ROUND IN HER
THOUGHTS MEASURING MY FITNESS FOR A PURPOSE WEIGHING MY VALUE IN A
PLAN
MADAME HAD ERE THIS SCRUTINIZED ALL I HAD AND I BELIEVE SHE
ESTEEMED HERSELF COGNIZANT OF MUCH THAT I WAS BUT FROM THAT DAY FOR
THE SPACE OF ABOUT A FORTNIGHT SHE TRIED ME BY NEW TESTS
SHE LISTENED
AT THE NURSERY DOOR WHEN I WAS SHUT IN WITH THE CHILDREN SHE FOLLOWED
ME AT A CAUTIOUS DISTANCE WHEN I WALKED OUT WITH THEM STEALING WITHIN
EAR SHOT WHENEVER THE TREES OF PARK OR BOULEVARD AFFORDED A SUFFICIENT
SCREEN A STRICT PRELIMINARY PROCESS HAVING THUS BEEN OBSERVED SHE
MADE A MOVE FORWARD
ONE MORNING COMING ON ME ABRUPTLY AND WITH THE SEMBLANCE OF HURRY
SHE SAID SHE FOUND HERSELF PLACED IN A LITTLE DILEMMA
MR
WILSON THE
ENGLISH MASTER HAD FAILED TO COME AT HIS HOUR SHE FEARED HE WAS ILL
THE PUPILS WERE WAITING IN CLASSE THERE WAS NO ONE TO GIVE A LESSON
SHOULD I FOR ONCE OBJECT TO GIVING A SHORT DICTATION EXERCISE JUST
THAT THE PUPILS MIGHT NOT HAVE IT TO SAY THEY HAD MISSED THEIR ENGLISH
LESSON
IN CLASSE MADAME I ASKED
YES IN CLASSE IN THE SECOND DIVISION
WHERE THERE ARE SIXTY PUPILS SAID I FOR I KNEW THE NUMBER AND WITH
MY USUAL BASE HABIT OF COWARDICE I SHRANK INTO MY SLOTH LIKE A SNAIL
INTO ITS SHELL AND ALLEGED INCAPACITY AND IMPRACTICABILITY AS A
PRETEXT TO ESCAPE ACTION
IF LEFT TO MYSELF I SHOULD INFALLIBLY HAVE
LET THIS CHANCE SLIP
INADVENTUROUS UNSTIRRED BY IMPULSES OF PRACTICAL
AMBITION I WAS CAPABLE OF SITTING TWENTY YEARS TEACHING INFANTS THE
HORNBOOK TURNING SILK DRESSES AND MAKING CHILDREN'S FROCKS
NOT THAT
TRUE CONTENTMENT DIGNIFIED THIS INFATUATED RESIGNATION MY WORK HAD
NEITHER CHARM FOR MY TASTE NOR HOLD ON MY INTEREST BUT IT SEEMED TO
ME A GREAT THING TO BE WITHOUT HEAVY ANXIETY AND RELIEVED FROM
INTIMATE TRIAL THE NEGATION OF SEVERE SUFFERING WAS THE NEAREST
APPROACH TO HAPPINESS I EXPECTED TO KNOW
BESIDES I SEEMED TO HOLD TWO
LIVES THE LIFE OF THOUGHT AND THAT OF REALITY AND PROVIDED THE
FORMER WAS NOURISHED WITH A SUFFICIENCY OF THE STRANGE NECROMANTIC JOYS
OF FANCY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE LATTER MIGHT REMAIN LIMITED TO DAILY
BREAD HOURLY WORK AND A ROOF OF SHELTER
COME SAID MADAME AS I STOOPED MORE BUSILY THAN EVER OVER THE
CUTTING OUT OF A CHILD'S PINAFORE LEAVE THAT WORK
BUT FIFINE WANTS IT MADAME
FIFINE MUST WANT IT THEN FOR I WANT YOU
AND AS MADAME BECK DID REALLY WANT AND WAS RESOLVED TO HAVE ME AS SHE
HAD LONG BEEN DISSATISFIED WITH THE ENGLISH MASTER WITH HIS
SHORTCOMINGS IN PUNCTUALITY AND HIS CARELESS METHOD OF TUITION AS
TOO SHE DID NOT LACK RESOLUTION AND PRACTICAL ACTIVITY WHETHER I
LACKED THEM OR NOT SHE WITHOUT MORE ADO MADE ME RELINQUISH THIMBLE
AND NEEDLE MY HAND WAS TAKEN INTO HERS AND I WAS CONDUCTED
DOWN STAIRS
WHEN WE REACHED THE CARR A LARGE SQUARE HALL BETWEEN THE
DWELLING HOUSE AND THE PENSIONNAT SHE PAUSED DROPPED MY HAND FACED
AND SCRUTINIZED ME
I WAS FLUSHED AND TREMULOUS FROM HEAD TO FOOT
TELL IT NOT IN GATH I BELIEVE I WAS CRYING
IN FACT THE DIFFICULTIES
BEFORE ME WERE FAR FROM BEING WHOLLY IMAGINARY SOME OF THEM WERE REAL
ENOUGH AND NOT THE LEAST SUBSTANTIAL LAY IN MY WANT OF MASTERY OVER
THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO TEACH
I HAD INDEED
STUDIED FRENCH CLOSELY SINCE MY ARRIVAL IN VILLETTE LEARNING ITS
PRACTICE BY DAY AND ITS THEORY IN EVERY LEISURE MOMENT AT NIGHT TO AS
LATE AN HOUR AS THE RULE OF THE HOUSE WOULD ALLOW CANDLE LIGHT BUT I
WAS FAR FROM YET BEING ABLE TO TRUST MY POWERS OF CORRECT ORAL
EXPRESSION
DTES DONC SAID MADAME STERNLY VOUS SENTEZ VOUS RELLEMENT TROP
FAIBLE
I MIGHT HAVE SAID YES AND GONE BACK TO NURSERY OBSCURITY AND THERE
PERHAPS MOULDERED FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE BUT LOOKING UP AT MADAME I
SAW IN HER COUNTENANCE A SOMETHING THAT MADE ME THINK TWICE ERE I
DECIDED
AT THAT INSTANT SHE DID NOT WEAR A WOMAN'S ASPECT BUT RATHER
A MAN'S
POWER OF A PARTICULAR KIND STRONGLY LIMNED ITSELF IN ALL HER
TRAITS AND THAT POWER WAS NOT MY KIND OF POWER NEITHER SYMPATHY NOR
CONGENIALITY NOR SUBMISSION WERE THE EMOTIONS IT AWAKENED
I
STOOD NOT SOOTHED NOR WON NOR OVERWHELMED
IT SEEMED AS IF A
CHALLENGE OF STRENGTH BETWEEN OPPOSING GIFTS WAS GIVEN AND I SUDDENLY
FELT ALL THE DISHONOUR OF MY DIFFIDENCE ALL THE PUSILLANIMITY OF MY
SLACKNESS TO ASPIRE
WILL YOU SHE SAID GO BACKWARD OR FORWARD INDICATING WITH HER
HAND FIRST THE SMALL DOOR OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE DWELLING HOUSE
AND THEN THE GREAT DOUBLE PORTALS OF THE CLASSES OR SCHOOLROOMS
EN AVANT I SAID
BUT PURSUED SHE COOLING AS I WARMED AND CONTINUING THE HARD LOOK
FROM VERY ANTIPATHY TO WHICH I DREW STRENGTH AND DETERMINATION CAN
YOU FACE THE CLASSES OR ARE YOU OVER EXCITED
SHE SNEERED SLIGHTLY IN SAYING THIS NERVOUS EXCITABILITY WAS NOT MUCH
TO MADAME'S TASTE
I AM NO MORE EXCITED THAN THIS STONE I SAID TAPPING THE FLAG WITH
MY TOE OR THAN YOU I ADDED RETURNING HER LOOK
BON BUT LET ME TELL YOU THESE ARE NOT QUIET DECOROUS ENGLISH GIRLS
YOU ARE GOING TO ENCOUNTER
CE SONT DES LABASSECOURIENNES RONDES
FRANCHES BRUSQUES ET TANT SOIT PEU REBELLES
I SAID I KNOW AND I KNOW TOO THAT THOUGH I HAVE STUDIED FRENCH
HARD SINCE I CAME HERE YET I STILL SPEAK IT WITH FAR TOO MUCH
HESITATION TOO LITTLE ACCURACY TO BE ABLE TO COMMAND THEIR RESPECT I
SHALL MAKE BLUNDERS THAT WILL LAY ME OPEN TO THE SCORN OF THE MOST
IGNORANT
STILL I MEAN TO GIVE THE LESSON
THEY ALWAYS THROW OVER TIMID TEACHERS SAID SHE
I KNOW THAT TOO MADAME I HAVE HEARD HOW THEY REBELLED AGAINST AND
PERSECUTED MISS TURNER A POOR FRIENDLESS ENGLISH TEACHER WHOM MADAME
HAD EMPLOYED AND LIGHTLY DISCARDED AND TO WHOSE PITEOUS HISTORY I WAS
NO STRANGER
C'EST VRAI SAID SHE COOLLY
MISS TURNER HAD NO MORE COMMAND OVER
THEM THAN A SERVANT FROM THE KITCHEN WOULD HAVE HAD
SHE WAS WEAK AND
WAVERING SHE HAD NEITHER TACT NOR INTELLIGENCE DECISION NOR DIGNITY
MISS TURNER WOULD NOT DO FOR THESE GIRLS AT ALL
I MADE NO REPLY BUT ADVANCED TO THE CLOSED SCHOOLROOM DOOR
YOU WILL NOT EXPECT AID FROM ME OR FROM ANY ONE SAID MADAME
THAT
WOULD AT ONCE SET YOU DOWN AS INCOMPETENT FOR YOUR OFFICE
I OPENED THE DOOR LET HER PASS WITH COURTESY AND FOLLOWED HER
THERE
WERE THREE SCHOOLROOMS ALL LARGE
THAT DEDICATED TO THE SECOND
DIVISION WHERE I WAS TO FIGURE WAS CONSIDERABLY THE LARGEST AND
ACCOMMODATED AN ASSEMBLAGE MORE NUMEROUS MORE TURBULENT AND
INFINITELY MORE UNMANAGEABLE THAN THE OTHER TWO
IN AFTER DAYS WHEN I
KNEW THE GROUND BETTER I USED TO THINK SOMETIMES IF SUCH A COMPARISON
MAY BE PERMITTED THAT THE QUIET POLISHED TAME FIRST DIVISION WAS TO
THE ROBUST RIOTOUS DEMONSTRATIVE SECOND DIVISION WHAT THE ENGLISH
HOUSE OF LORDS IS TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
THE FIRST GLANCE INFORMED ME THAT MANY OF THE PUPILS WERE MORE THAN
GIRLS QUITE YOUNG WOMEN I KNEW THAT SOME OF THEM WERE OF NOBLE FAMILY
AS NOBILITY GOES IN LABASSECOUR AND I WAS WELL CONVINCED THAT NOT
ONE AMONGST THEM WAS IGNORANT OF MY POSITION IN MADAME'S HOUSEHOLD
AS
I MOUNTED THE ESTRDE A LOW PLATFORM RAISED A STEP ABOVE THE
FLOORING WHERE STOOD THE TEACHER'S CHAIR AND DESK I BEHELD OPPOSITE
TO ME A ROW OF EYES AND BROWS THAT THREATENED STORMY WEATHER EYES FULL
OF AN INSOLENT LIGHT AND BROWS HARD AND UNBLUSHING AS MARBLE
THE
CONTINENTAL FEMALE IS QUITE A DIFFERENT BEING TO THE INSULAR FEMALE
OF THE SAME AGE AND CLASS I NEVER SAW SUCH EYES AND BROWS IN ENGLAND
MADAME BECK INTRODUCED ME IN ONE COOL PHRASE SAILED FROM THE ROOM AND
LEFT ME ALONE IN MY GLORY
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT FIRST LESSON NOR ALL THE UNDER CURRENT OF
LIFE AND CHARACTER IT OPENED UP TO ME
THEN FIRST DID I BEGIN RIGHTLY
TO SEE THE WIDE DIFFERENCE THAT LIES BETWEEN THE NOVELIST'S AND POET'S
IDEAL JEUNE FILLE AND THE SAID JEUNE FILLE AS SHE REALLY IS
IT SEEMS THAT THREE TITLED BELLES IN THE FIRST ROW HAD SAT DOWN
PREDETERMINED THAT A BONNE D'ENFANTS SHOULD NOT GIVE THEM LESSONS IN
ENGLISH
THEY KNEW THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN EXPELLING OBNOXIOUS TEACHERS
BEFORE NOW THEY KNEW THAT MADAME WOULD AT ANY TIME THROW OVERBOARD A
PROFESSEUR OR MAITRESSE WHO BECAME UNPOPULAR WITH THE SCHOOL THAT SHE
NEVER ASSISTED A WEAK OFFICIAL TO RETAIN HIS PLACE THAT IF HE HAD NOT
STRENGTH TO FIGHT OR TACT TO WIN HIS WAY DOWN HE WENT LOOKING AT
MISS SNOWE THEY PROMISED THEMSELVES AN EASY VICTORY
MESDEMOISELLES BLANCHE VIRGINIE AND ANGLIQUE OPENED THE CAMPAIGN BY
A SERIES OF TITTERINGS AND WHISPERINGS THESE SOON SWELLED INTO MURMURS
AND SHORT LAUGHS WHICH THE REMOTER BENCHES CAUGHT UP AND ECHOED MORE
LOUDLY
THIS GROWING REVOLT OF SIXTY AGAINST ONE SOON BECAME
OPPRESSIVE ENOUGH MY COMMAND OF FRENCH BEING SO LIMITED AND EXERCISED
UNDER SUCH CRUEL CONSTRAINT
COULD I BUT HAVE SPOKEN IN MY OWN TONGUE I FELT AS IF I MIGHT HAVE
GAINED A HEARING FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE THOUGH I KNEW I LOOKED A
POOR CREATURE AND IN MANY RESPECTS ACTUALLY WAS SO YET NATURE HAD
GIVEN ME A VOICE THAT COULD MAKE ITSELF HEARD IF LIFTED IN EXCITEMENT
OR DEEPENED BY EMOTION
IN THE SECOND PLACE WHILE I HAD NO FLOW ONLY
A HESITATING TRICKLE OF LANGUAGE IN ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES YET UNDER
STIMULUS SUCH AS WAS NOW RIFE THROUGH THE MUTINOUS MASS I COULD IN
ENGLISH HAVE ROLLED OUT READILY PHRASES STIGMATIZING THEIR PROCEEDINGS
AS SUCH PROCEEDINGS DESERVED TO BE STIGMATIZED AND THEN WITH SOME
SARCASM FLAVOURED WITH CONTEMPTUOUS BITTERNESS FOR THE RINGLEADERS
AND RELIEVED WITH EASY BANTER FOR THE WEAKER BUT LESS KNAVISH
FOLLOWERS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ONE MIGHT POSSIBLY GET COMMAND OVER
THIS WILD HERD AND BRING THEM INTO TRAINING AT LEAST
ALL I COULD NOW
DO WAS TO WALK UP TO BLANCHE MADEMOISELLE DE MELCY A YOUNG
BARONNE THE ELDEST TALLEST HANDSOMEST AND MOST VICIOUS STAND
BEFORE HER DESK TAKE FROM UNDER HER HAND HER EXERCISE BOOK REMOUNT
THE ESTRADE DELIBERATELY READ THE COMPOSITION WHICH I FOUND VERY
STUPID AND AS DELIBERATELY AND IN THE FACE OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL TEAR
THE BLOTTED PAGE IN TWO
THIS ACTION AVAILED TO DRAW ATTENTION AND CHECK NOISE
ONE GIRL ALONE
QUITE IN THE BACKGROUND PERSEVERED IN THE RIOT WITH UNDIMINISHED
ENERGY
I LOOKED AT HER ATTENTIVELY
SHE HAD A PALE FACE HAIR LIKE
NIGHT BROAD STRONG EYEBROWS DECIDED FEATURES AND A DARK MUTINOUS
SINISTER EYE I NOTED THAT SHE SAT CLOSE BY A LITTLE DOOR WHICH DOOR
I WAS WELL AWARE OPENED INTO A SMALL CLOSET WHERE BOOKS WERE KEPT
SHE
WAS STANDING UP FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING HER CLAMOUR WITH FREER
ENERGIES
I MEASURED HER STATURE AND CALCULATED HER STRENGTH SHE SEEMED
BOTH TALL AND WIRY BUT SO THE CONFLICT WERE BRIEF AND THE ATTACK
UNEXPECTED I THOUGHT I MIGHT MANAGE HER
ADVANCING UP THE ROOM LOOKING AS COOL AND CARELESS AS I POSSIBLY
COULD IN SHORT AYANT L'AIR DE RIEN I SLIGHTLY PUSHED THE DOOR AND
FOUND IT WAS AJAR
IN AN INSTANT AND WITH SHARPNESS I HAD TURNED ON
HER
IN ANOTHER INSTANT SHE OCCUPIED THE CLOSET THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND
THE KEY IN MY POCKET
IT SO HAPPENED THAT THIS GIRL DOLORES BY NAME AND A CATALONIAN BY
RACE WAS THE SORT OF CHARACTER AT ONCE DREADED AND HATED BY ALL HER
ASSOCIATES THE ACT OF SUMMARY JUSTICE ABOVE NOTED PROVED POPULAR
THERE WAS NOT ONE PRESENT BUT IN HER HEART LIKED TO SEE IT DONE
THEY
WERE STILLED FOR A MOMENT THEN A SMILE NOT A LAUGH PASSED FROM DESK
TO DESK THEN WHEN I HAD GRAVELY AND TRANQUILLY RETURNED TO THE
ESTRADE COURTEOUSLY REQUESTED SILENCE AND COMMENCED A DICTATION AS IF
NOTHING AT ALL HAD HAPPENED THE PENS TRAVELLED PEACEFULLY OVER THE
PAGES AND THE REMAINDER OF THE LESSON PASSED IN ORDER AND INDUSTRY
C'EST BIEN SAID MADAME BECK WHEN I CAME OUT OF CLASS HOT AND A
LITTLE EXHAUSTED
CA IRA
SHE HAD BEEN LISTENING AND PEEPING THROUGH A SPY HOLE THE WHOLE TIME
FROM THAT DAY I CEASED TO BE NURSERY GOVERNESS AND BECAME ENGLISH
TEACHER
MADAME RAISED MY SALARY BUT SHE GOT THRICE THE WORK OUT OF ME
SHE HAD EXTRACTED FROM MR
WILSON AT HALF THE EXPENSE
CHAPTER IX
ISIDORE
MY TIME WAS NOW WELL AND PROFITABLY FILLED UP
WHAT WITH TEACHING
OTHERS AND STUDYING CLOSELY MYSELF I HAD HARDLY A SPARE MOMENT
IT WAS
PLEASANT
I FELT I WAS GETTING ON NOT LYING THE STAGNANT PREY OF
MOULD AND RUST BUT POLISHING MY FACULTIES AND WHETTING THEM TO A KEEN
EDGE WITH CONSTANT USE
EXPERIENCE OF A CERTAIN KIND LAY BEFORE ME ON
NO NARROW SCALE
VILLETTE IS A COSMOPOLITAN CITY AND IN THIS SCHOOL
WERE GIRLS OF ALMOST EVERY EUROPEAN NATION AND LIKEWISE OF VERY VARIED
RANK IN LIFE
EQUALITY IS MUCH PRACTISED IN LABASSECOUR THOUGH NOT
REPUBLICAN IN FORM IT IS NEARLY SO IN SUBSTANCE AND AT THE DESKS OF
MADAME BECK'S ESTABLISHMENT THE YOUNG COUNTESS AND THE YOUNG BOURGEOISE
SAT SIDE BY SIDE
NOR COULD YOU ALWAYS BY OUTWARD INDICATIONS DECIDE
WHICH WAS NOBLE AND WHICH PLEBEIAN EXCEPT THAT INDEED THE LATTER HAD
OFTEN FRANKER AND MORE COURTEOUS MANNERS WHILE THE FORMER BORE AWAY
THE BELL FOR A DELICATELY BALANCED COMBINATION OF INSOLENCE AND DECEIT
IN THE FORMER THERE WAS OFTEN QUICK FRENCH BLOOD MIXED WITH THE
MARSH PHLEGM I REGRET TO SAY THAT THE EFFECT OF THIS VIVACIOUS FLUID
CHIEFLY APPEARED IN THE OILIER GLIBNESS WITH WHICH FLATTERY AND FICTION
RAN FROM THE TONGUE AND IN A MANNER LIGHTER AND LIVELIER BUT QUITE
HEARTLESS AND INSINCERE
TO DO ALL PARTIES JUSTICE THE HONEST ABORIGINAL LABASSECOURIENNES HAD
AN HYPOCRISY OF THEIR OWN TOO BUT IT WAS OF A COARSE ORDER SUCH AS
COULD DECEIVE FEW
WHENEVER A LIE WAS NECESSARY FOR THEIR OCCASIONS
THEY BROUGHT IT OUT WITH A CARELESS EASE AND BREADTH ALTOGETHER
UNTROUBLED BY THE REBUKE OF CONSCIENCE
NOT A SOUL IN MADAME BECK'S
HOUSE FROM THE SCULLION TO THE DIRECTRESS HERSELF BUT WAS ABOVE BEING
ASHAMED OF A LIE THEY THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT TO INVENT MIGHT NOT BE
PRECISELY A VIRTUE BUT IT WAS THE MOST VENIAL OF FAULTS
J'AI MENTI
PLUSIEURS FOIS FORMED AN ITEM OF EVERY GIRL'S AND WOMAN'S MONTHLY
CONFESSION THE PRIEST HEARD UNSHOCKED AND ABSOLVED UNRELUCTANT
IF
THEY HAD MISSED GOING TO MASS OR READ A CHAPTER OF A NOVEL THAT WAS
ANOTHER THING THESE WERE CRIMES WHEREOF REBUKE AND PENANCE WERE THE
UNFAILING WEED
WHILE YET BUT HALF CONSCIOUS OF THIS STATE OF THINGS AND UNLEARNED IN
ITS RESULTS I GOT ON IN MY NEW SPHERE VERY WELL
AFTER THE FIRST FEW
DIFFICULT LESSONS GIVEN AMIDST PERIL AND ON THE EDGE OF A MORAL
VOLCANO THAT RUMBLED UNDER MY FEET AND SENT SPARKS AND HOT FUMES INTO
MY EYES THE ERUPTIVE SPIRIT SEEMED TO SUBSIDE AS FAR AS I WAS
CONCERNED
MY MIND WAS A GOOD DEAL BENT ON SUCCESS I COULD NOT BEAR
THE THOUGHT OF BEING BAFFLED BY MERE UNDISCIPLINED DISAFFECTION AND
WANTON INDOCILITY IN THIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO GET ON IN LIFE
MANY HOURS
OF THE NIGHT I USED TO LIE AWAKE THINKING WHAT PLAN I HAD BEST ADOPT
TO GET A RELIABLE HOLD ON THESE MUTINEERS TO BRING THIS STIFF NECKED
TRIBE UNDER PERMANENT INFLUENCE
IN THE FIRST PLACE I SAW PLAINLY
THAT AID IN NO SHAPE WAS TO BE EXPECTED FROM MADAME HER RIGHTEOUS PLAN
WAS TO MAINTAIN AN UNBROKEN POPULARITY WITH THE PUPILS AT ANY AND
EVERY COST OF JUSTICE OR COMFORT TO THE TEACHERS
FOR A TEACHER TO SEEK
HER ALLIANCE IN ANY CRISIS OF INSUBORDINATION WAS EQUIVALENT TO
SECURING HER OWN EXPULSION
IN INTERCOURSE WITH HER PUPILS MADAME ONLY
TOOK TO HERSELF WHAT WAS PLEASANT AMIABLE AND RECOMMENDATORY RIGIDLY
REQUIRING OF HER LIEUTENANTS SUFFICIENCY FOR EVERY ANNOYING CRISIS
WHERE TO ACT WITH ADEQUATE PROMPTITUDE WAS TO BE UNPOPULAR
THUS I
MUST LOOK ONLY TO MYSELF
IMPRIMIS IT WAS CLEAR AS THE DAY THAT THIS SWINISH MULTITUDE WERE NOT
TO BE DRIVEN BY FORCE
THEY WERE TO BE HUMOURED BORNE WITH VERY
PATIENTLY A COURTEOUS THOUGH SEDATE MANNER IMPRESSED THEM A VERY RARE
FLASH OF RAILLERY DID GOOD
SEVERE OR CONTINUOUS MENTAL APPLICATION
THEY COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT BEAR HEAVY DEMAND ON THE MEMORY THE
REASON THE ATTENTION THEY REJECTED POINT BLANK
WHERE AN ENGLISH GIRL
OF NOT MORE THAN AVERAGE CAPACITY AND DOCILITY WOULD QUIETLY TAKE A
THEME AND BIND HERSELF TO THE TASK OF COMPREHENSION AND MASTERY A
LABASSECOURIENNE WOULD LAUGH IN YOUR FACE AND THROW IT BACK TO YOU
WITH THE PHRASE DIEU QUE C'EST DIFFICILE JE N'EN VEUX PAS
CELA
M'ENNUIE TROP
A TEACHER WHO UNDERSTOOD HER BUSINESS WOULD TAKE IT BACK AT ONCE
WITHOUT HESITATION CONTEST OR EXPOSTULATION PROCEED WITH EVEN
EXAGGERATED CARE TO SMOOTHE EVERY DIFFICULTY TO REDUCE IT TO THE LEVEL
OF THEIR UNDERSTANDINGS RETURN IT TO THEM THUS MODIFIED AND LAY ON
THE LASH OF SARCASM WITH UNSPARING HAND
THEY WOULD FEEL THE STING
PERHAPS WINCE A LITTLE UNDER IT BUT THEY BORE NO MALICE AGAINST THIS
SORT OF ATTACK PROVIDED THE SNEER WAS NOT SOUR BUT HEARTY AND
THAT IT HELD WELL UP TO THEM IN A CLEAR LIGHT AND BOLD TYPE SO THAT
SHE WHO RAN MIGHT READ THEIR INCAPACITY IGNORANCE AND SLOTH
THEY
WOULD RIOT FOR THREE ADDITIONAL LINES TO A LESSON BUT I NEVER KNEW
THEM REBEL AGAINST A WOUND GIVEN TO THEIR SELF RESPECT THE LITTLE THEY
HAD OF THAT QUALITY WAS TRAINED TO BE CRUSHED AND IT RATHER LIKED THE
PRESSURE OF A FIRM HEEL THAN OTHERWISE
BY DEGREES AS I ACQUIRED FLUENCY AND FREEDOM IN THEIR LANGUAGE AND
COULD MAKE SUCH APPLICATION OF ITS MORE NERVOUS IDIOMS AS SUITED THEIR
CASE THE ELDER AND MORE INTELLIGENT GIRLS BEGAN RATHER TO LIKE ME IN
THEIR WAY I NOTICED THAT WHENEVER A PUPIL HAD BEEN ROUSED TO FEEL IN
HER SOUL THE STIRRING OF WORTHY EMULATION OR THE QUICKENING OF HONEST
SHAME FROM THAT DATE SHE WAS WON
IF I COULD BUT ONCE MAKE THEIR
USUALLY LARGE EARS BURN UNDER THEIR THICK GLOSSY HAIR ALL WAS
COMPARATIVELY WELL
BY AND BY BOUQUETS BEGAN TO BE LAID ON MY DESK IN
THE MORNING BY WAY OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR THIS LITTLE FOREIGN
ATTENTION I USED SOMETIMES TO WALK WITH A SELECT FEW DURING
RECREATION
IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION IT BEFEL ONCE OR TWICE THAT I
MADE AN UNPREMEDITATED ATTEMPT TO RECTIFY SOME OF THEIR SINGULARLY
DISTORTED NOTIONS OF PRINCIPLE ESPECIALLY I EXPRESSED MY IDEAS OF THE
EVIL AND BASENESS OF A LIE
IN AN UNGUARDED MOMENT I CHANCED TO SAY
THAT OF THE TWO ERRORS I CONSIDERED FALSEHOOD WORSE THAN AN
OCCASIONAL LAPSE IN CHURCH ATTENDANCE
THE POOR GIRLS WERE TUTORED TO
REPORT IN CATHOLIC EARS WHATEVER THE PROTESTANT TEACHER SAID
AN
EDIFYING CONSEQUENCE ENSUED
SOMETHING AN UNSEEN AN INDEFINITE A
NAMELESS SOMETHING STOLE BETWEEN MYSELF AND THESE MY BEST PUPILS THE
BOUQUETS CONTINUED TO BE OFFERED BUT CONVERSATION THENCEFORTH BECAME
IMPRACTICABLE
AS I PACED THE ALLEYS OR SAT IN THE BERCEAU A GIRL
NEVER CAME TO MY RIGHT HAND BUT A TEACHER AS IF BY MAGIC APPEARED AT
MY LEFT
ALSO WONDERFUL TO RELATE MADAME'S SHOES OF SILENCE BROUGHT
HER CONTINUALLY TO MY BACK AS QUICK AS NOISELESS AND UNEXPECTED AS
SOME WANDERING ZEPHYR
THE OPINION OF MY CATHOLIC ACQUAINTANCE CONCERNING MY SPIRITUAL
PROSPECTS WAS SOMEWHAT NAVELY EXPRESSED TO ME ON ONE OCCASION
A
PENSIONNAIRE TO WHOM I HAD RENDERED SOME LITTLE SERVICE EXCLAIMED ONE
DAY AS SHE SAT BESIDE ME MADEMOISELLE WHAT A PITY YOU ARE A
PROTESTANT
WHY ISABELLE
PARCEQUE QUAND VOUS SEREZ MORTE VOUS BRLEREZ TOUT DE SUITE DANS
L'ENFER
CROYEZ VOUS
CERTAINEMENT QUE J'Y CROIS TOUT LE MONDE LE SAIT ET D'AILLEURS LE
PRTRE ME L'A DIT
ISABELLE WAS AN ODD BLUNT LITTLE CREATURE
SHE ADDED SOTTO VOCE
POUR ASSURER VOTRE SALUT L HAUT ON FERAIT BIEN DE VOUS BRLER TOUTE
VIVE ICI BAS
I LAUGHED AS INDEED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO OTHERWISE
HAS THE READER FORGOTTEN MISS GINEVRA FANSHAWE IF SO I MUST BE
ALLOWED TO RE INTRODUCE THAT YOUNG LADY AS A THRIVING PUPIL OF MADAME
BECK'S FOR SUCH SHE WAS
ON HER ARRIVAL IN THE RUE FOSSETTE TWO OR
THREE DAYS AFTER MY SUDDEN SETTLEMENT THERE SHE ENCOUNTERED ME WITH
VERY LITTLE SURPRISE
SHE MUST HAVE HAD GOOD BLOOD IN HER VEINS FOR
NEVER WAS ANY DUCHESS MORE PERFECTLY RADICALLY UNAFFECTEDLY
NONCHALANTE THAN SHE A WEAK TRANSIENT AMAZE WAS ALL SHE KNEW OF THE
SENSATION OF WONDER
MOST OF HER OTHER FACULTIES SEEMED TO BE IN THE
SAME FLIMSY CONDITION HER LIKING AND DISLIKING HER LOVE AND HATE
WERE MERE COBWEB AND GOSSAMER BUT SHE HAD ONE THING ABOUT HER THAT
SEEMED STRONG AND DURABLE ENOUGH AND THAT WAS HER SELFISHNESS
SHE WAS NOT PROUD AND BONNE D'ENFANTS AS I WAS SHE WOULD FORTHWITH
HAVE MADE OF ME A SORT OF FRIEND AND CONFIDANT
SHE TEASED ME WITH A
THOUSAND VAPID COMPLAINTS ABOUT SCHOOL QUARRELS AND HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY
THE COOKERY WAS NOT TO HER TASTE THE PEOPLE ABOUT HER TEACHERS AND
PUPILS SHE HELD TO BE DESPICABLE BECAUSE THEY WERE FOREIGNERS
I BORE
WITH HER ABUSE OF THE FRIDAY'S SALT FISH AND HARD EGGS WITH HER
INVECTIVE AGAINST THE SOUP THE BREAD THE COFFEE WITH SOME PATIENCE
FOR A TIME BUT AT LAST WEARIED BY ITERATION I TURNED CRUSTY AND PUT
HER TO RIGHTS A THING I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE IN THE VERY BEGINNING FOR
A SALUTARY SETTING DOWN ALWAYS AGREED WITH HER
MUCH LONGER HAD I TO ENDURE HER DEMANDS ON ME IN THE WAY OF WORK
HER
WARDROBE SO FAR AS CONCERNED ARTICLES OF EXTERNAL WEAR WAS WELL AND
ELEGANTLY SUPPLIED BUT THERE WERE OTHER HABILIMENTS NOT SO CAREFULLY
PROVIDED WHAT SHE HAD NEEDED FREQUENT REPAIR
SHE HATED
NEEDLE DRUDGERY HERSELF AND SHE WOULD BRING HER HOSE C
TO ME IN
HEAPS TO BE MENDED
A COMPLIANCE OF SOME WEEKS THREATENING TO RESULT
IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTOLERABLE BORE I AT LAST DISTINCTLY TOLD
HER SHE MUST MAKE UP HER MIND TO MEND HER OWN GARMENTS
SHE CRIED ON
RECEIVING THIS INFORMATION AND ACCUSED ME OF HAVING CEASED TO BE HER
FRIEND BUT I HELD BY MY DECISION AND LET THE HYSTERICS PASS AS THEY
COULD
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE FOIBLES AND VARIOUS OTHERS NEEDLESS TO
MENTION BUT BY NO MEANS OF A REFINED OR ELEVATING CHARACTER HOW
PRETTY SHE WAS HOW CHARMING SHE LOOKED WHEN SHE CAME DOWN ON A SUNNY
SUNDAY MORNING WELL DRESSED AND WELL HUMOURED ROBED IN PALE LILAC
SILK AND WITH HER FAIR LONG CURLS REPOSING ON HER WHITE SHOULDERS
SUNDAY WAS A HOLIDAY WHICH SHE ALWAYS PASSED WITH FRIENDS RESIDENT IN
TOWN AND AMONGST THESE FRIENDS SHE SPEEDILY GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND WAS
ONE WHO WOULD FAIN BECOME SOMETHING MORE
BY GLIMPSES AND HINTS IT WAS
SHOWN ME AND BY THE GENERAL BUOYANCY OF HER LOOK AND MANNER IT WAS ERE
LONG PROVED THAT ARDENT ADMIRATION PERHAPS GENUINE LOVE WAS AT HER
COMMAND
SHE CALLED HER SUITOR ISIDORE THIS HOWEVER SHE INTIMATED
WAS NOT HIS REAL NAME BUT ONE BY WHICH IT PLEASED HER TO BAPTIZE
HIM HIS OWN SHE HINTED NOT BEING VERY PRETTY ONCE WHEN SHE HAD
BEEN BRAGGING ABOUT THE VEHEMENCE OF ISIDORE'S ATTACHMENT I ASKED IF
SHE LOVED HIM IN RETURN
COMME CELA SAID SHE HE IS HANDSOME AND HE LOVES ME TO
DISTRACTION SO THAT I AM WELL AMUSED
CA SUFFIT
FINDING THAT SHE CARRIED THE THING ON LONGER THAN FROM HER VERY FICKLE
TASTES I HAD ANTICIPATED I ONE DAY TOOK IT UPON ME TO MAKE SERIOUS
INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER THE GENTLEMAN WAS SUCH AS HER PARENTS AND
ESPECIALLY HER UNCLE ON WHOM IT APPEARED SHE WAS DEPENDENT WOULD BE
LIKELY TO APPROVE
SHE ALLOWED THAT THIS WAS VERY DOUBTFUL AS SHE DID
NOT BELIEVE ISIDORE HAD MUCH MONEY
DO YOU ENCOURAGE HIM I ASKED
FURIEUSEMENT SOMETIMES SAID SHE
WITHOUT BEING CERTAIN THAT YOU WILL BE PERMITTED TO MARRY HIM
OH HOW DOWDYISH YOU ARE I DON'T WANT TO BE MARRIED
I AM TOO YOUNG
BUT IF HE LOVES YOU AS MUCH AS YOU SAY AND YET IT COMES TO NOTHING IN
THE END HE WILL BE MADE MISERABLE
OF COURSE HE WILL BREAK HIS HEART
I SHOULD BE SHOCKED AND
DISAPPOINTED IF HE DIDN'T
I WONDER WHETHER THIS M
ISIDORE IS A FOOL SAID I
HE IS ABOUT ME BUT HE IS WISE IN OTHER THINGS CE QU'ON DIT
MRS
CHOLMONDELEY CONSIDERS HIM EXTREMELY CLEVER SHE SAYS HE WILL PUSH HIS
WAY BY HIS TALENTS ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE DOES LITTLE MORE THAN SIGH
IN MY PRESENCE AND THAT I CAN WIND HIM ROUND MY LITTLE FINGER
WISHING TO GET A MORE DEFINITE IDEA OF THIS LOVE STRICKEN M
ISIDORE
WHOSE POSITION SEEMED TO ME OF THE LEAST SECURE I REQUESTED HER TO
FAVOUR ME WITH A PERSONAL DESCRIPTION BUT SHE COULD NOT DESCRIBE SHE
HAD NEITHER WORDS NOR THE POWER OF PUTTING THEM TOGETHER SO AS TO MAKE
GRAPHIC PHRASES
SHE EVEN SEEMED NOT PROPERLY TO HAVE NOTICED HIM
NOTHING OF HIS LOOKS OF THE CHANGES IN HIS COUNTENANCE HAD TOUCHED
HER HEART OR DWELT IN HER MEMORY THAT HE WAS BEAU MAIS PLUTT BEL
HOMME QUE JOLI GARON WAS ALL SHE COULD ASSERT
MY PATIENCE WOULD
OFTEN HAVE FAILED AND MY INTEREST FLAGGED IN LISTENING TO HER BUT
FOR ONE THING
ALL THE HINTS SHE DROPPED ALL THE DETAILS SHE GAVE
WENT UNCONSCIOUSLY TO PROVE TO MY THINKING THAT M
ISIDORE'S HOMAGE
WAS OFFERED WITH GREAT DELICACY AND RESPECT
I INFORMED HER VERY
PLAINLY THAT I BELIEVED HIM MUCH TOO GOOD FOR HER AND INTIMATED WITH
EQUAL PLAINNESS MY IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS BUT A VAIN COQUETTE
SHE
LAUGHED SHOOK HER CURLS FROM HER EYES AND DANCED AWAY AS IF I HAD
PAID HER A COMPLIMENT
MISS GINEVRA'S SCHOOL STUDIES WERE LITTLE BETTER THAN NOMINAL THERE
WERE BUT THREE THINGS SHE PRACTISED IN EARNEST VIZ
MUSIC SINGING
AND DANCING ALSO EMBROIDERING THE FINE CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEFS WHICH SHE
COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY READY WORKED SUCH MERE TRIFLES AS LESSONS IN
HISTORY GEOGRAPHY GRAMMAR AND ARITHMETIC SHE LEFT UNDONE OR GOT
OTHERS TO DO FOR HER
VERY MUCH OF HER TIME WAS SPENT IN VISITING
MADAME AWARE THAT HER STAY AT SCHOOL WAS NOW LIMITED TO A CERTAIN
PERIOD WHICH WOULD NOT BE EXTENDED WHETHER SHE MADE PROGRESS OR NOT
ALLOWED HER GREAT LICENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR
MRS
CHOLMONDELEY HER
CHAPERON A GAY FASHIONABLE LADY INVITED HER WHENEVER SHE HAD
COMPANY AT HER OWN HOUSE AND SOMETIMES TOOK HER TO EVENING PARTIES AT
THE HOUSES OF HER ACQUAINTANCE
GINEVRA PERFECTLY APPROVED THIS MODE OF
PROCEDURE IT HAD BUT ONE INCONVENIENCE SHE WAS OBLIGED TO BE WELL
DRESSED AND SHE HAD NOT MONEY TO BUY VARIETY OF DRESSES
ALL HER
THOUGHTS TURNED ON THIS DIFFICULTY HER WHOLE SOUL WAS OCCUPIED WITH
EXPEDIENTS FOR EFFECTING ITS SOLUTION
IT WAS WONDERFUL TO WITNESS THE
ACTIVITY OF HER OTHERWISE INDOLENT MIND ON THIS POINT AND TO SEE THE
MUCH DARING INTREPIDITY TO WHICH SHE WAS SPURRED BY A SENSE OF
NECESSITY AND THE WISH TO SHINE
SHE BEGGED BOLDLY OF MRS
CHOLMONDELEY BOLDLY I SAY NOT WITH AN AIR
OF RELUCTANT SHAME BUT IN THIS STRAIN
MY DARLING MRS
C I HAVE NOTHING IN THE WORLD FIT TO WEAR FOR YOUR
PARTY NEXT WEEK YOU MUST GIVE ME A BOOK MUSLIN DRESS AND THEN A
CEINTURE BLEU CELESTE DO THERE'S AN ANGEL WILL YOU
THE DARLING MRS
C YIELDED AT FIRST BUT FINDING THAT APPLICATIONS
INCREASED AS THEY WERE COMPLIED WITH SHE WAS SOON OBLIGED LIKE ALL
MISS FANSHAWE'S FRIENDS TO OPPOSE RESISTANCE TO ENCROACHMENT
AFTER A
WHILE I HEARD NO MORE OF MRS
CHOLMONDELEY'S PRESENTS BUT STILL
VISITING WENT ON AND THE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY DRESSES CONTINUED TO BE
SUPPLIED ALSO MANY LITTLE EXPENSIVE ETCETERA GLOVES BOUQUETS EVEN
TRINKETS
THESE THINGS CONTRARY TO HER CUSTOM AND EVEN NATURE FOR
SHE WAS NOT SECRETIVE WERE MOST SEDULOUSLY KEPT OUT OF SIGHT FOR A
TIME BUT ONE EVENING WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO A LARGE PARTY FOR WHICH
PARTICULAR CARE AND ELEGANCE OF COSTUME WERE DEMANDED SHE COULD NOT
RESIST COMING TO MY CHAMBER TO SHOW HERSELF IN ALL HER SPLENDOUR
BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED SO YOUNG SO FRESH AND WITH A DELICACY OF SKIN
AND FLEXIBILITY OF SHAPE ALTOGETHER ENGLISH AND NOT FOUND IN THE LIST
OF CONTINENTAL FEMALE CHARMS
HER DRESS WAS NEW COSTLY AND PERFECT
I
SAW AT A GLANCE THAT IT LACKED NONE OF THOSE FINISHING DETAILS WHICH
COST SO MUCH AND GIVE TO THE GENERAL EFFECT SUCH AN AIR OF TASTEFUL
COMPLETENESS
I VIEWED HER FROM TOP TO TOE
SHE TURNED AIRILY ROUND THAT I MIGHT
SURVEY HER ON ALL SIDES
CONSCIOUS OF HER CHARMS SHE WAS IN HER BEST
HUMOUR HER RATHER SMALL BLUE EYES SPARKLED GLEEFULLY
SHE WAS GOING TO
BESTOW ON ME A KISS IN HER SCHOOL GIRL FASHION OF SHOWING HER DELIGHTS
BUT I SAID STEADY LET US BE STEADY AND KNOW WHAT WE ARE ABOUT AND
FIND OUT THE MEANING OF OUR MAGNIFICENCE AND SO PUT HER OFF AT ARM'S
LENGTH TO UNDERGO COOLER INSPECTION
SHALL I DO WAS HER QUESTION
DO SAID I
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING AND BY MY WORD I
DON'T UNDERSTAND YOURS
BUT HOW DO I LOOK
YOU LOOK WELL DRESSED
SHE THOUGHT THE PRAISE NOT WARM ENOUGH AND PROCEEDED TO DIRECT
ATTENTION TO THE VARIOUS DECORATIVE POINTS OF HER ATTIRE
LOOK AT THIS
PARURE SAID SHE
THE BROOCH THE EAR RINGS THE BRACELETS NO ONE
IN THE SCHOOL HAS SUCH A SET NOT MADAME HERSELF
I SEE THEM ALL PAUSE DID M
DE BASSOMPIERRE GIVE YOU THOSE
JEWELS
MY UNCLE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THEM
WERE THEY PRESENTS FROM MRS
CHOLMONDELEY
NOT THEY INDEED
MRS
CHOLMONDELEY IS A MEAN STINGY CREATURE SHE
NEVER GIVES ME ANYTHING NOW
I DID NOT CHOOSE TO ASK ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS BUT TURNED ABRUPTLY AWAY
NOW OLD CRUSTY OLD DIOGENES THESE WERE HER FAMILIAR TERMS FOR ME
WHEN WE DISAGREED WHAT IS THE MATTER NOW
TAKE YOURSELF AWAY
I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN LOOKING AT YOU OR YOUR
PARURE
FOR AN INSTANT SHE SEEMED TAKEN BY SURPRISE
WHAT NOW MOTHER WISDOM I HAVE NOT GOT INTO DEBT FOR IT THAT IS NOT
FOR THE JEWELS NOR THE GLOVES NOR THE BOUQUET
MY DRESS IS CERTAINLY
NOT PAID FOR BUT UNCLE DE BASSOMPIERRE WILL PAY IT IN THE BILL HE
NEVER NOTICES ITEMS BUT JUST LOOKS AT THE TOTAL AND HE IS SO RICH
ONE NEED NOT CARE ABOUT A FEW GUINEAS MORE OR LESS
WILL YOU GO I WANT TO SHUT THE DOOR
GINEVRA PEOPLE MAY TELL YOU
YOU ARE VERY HANDSOME IN THAT BALL ATTIRE BUT IN MY EYES YOU WILL
NEVER LOOK SO PRETTY AS YOU DID IN THE GINGHAM GOWN AND PLAIN STRAW
BONNET YOU WORE WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE NOT YOUR PURITANICAL TASTES WAS HER ANGRY REPLY
AND BESIDES I SEE NO RIGHT YOU HAVE TO SERMONIZE ME
CERTAINLY I HAVE LITTLE RIGHT AND YOU PERHAPS HAVE STILL LESS TO
COME FLOURISHING AND FLUTTERING INTO MY CHAMBER A MERE JAY IN BORROWED
PLUMES
I HAVE NOT THE LEAST RESPECT FOR YOUR FEATHERS MISS FANSHAWE
AND ESPECIALLY THE PEACOCK'S EYES YOU CALL A PARURE VERY PRETTY
THINGS IF YOU HAD BOUGHT THEM WITH MONEY WHICH WAS YOUR OWN AND WHICH
YOU COULD WELL SPARE BUT NOT AT ALL PRETTY UNDER PRESENT
CIRCUMSTANCES
ON EST L POUR MADEMOISELLE FANSHAWE WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE PORTRESS
AND AWAY SHE TRIPPED
THIS SEMI MYSTERY OF THE PARURE WAS NOT SOLVED TILL TWO OR THREE DAYS
AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE CAME TO MAKE A VOLUNTARY CONFESSION
YOU NEED NOT BE SULKY WITH ME SHE BEGAN IN THE IDEA THAT I AM
RUNNING SOMEBODY PAPA OR M
DE BASSOMPIERRE DEEPLY INTO DEBT
I
ASSURE YOU NOTHING REMAINS UNPAID FOR BUT THE FEW DRESSES I HAVE
LATELY HAD ALL THE REST IS SETTLED
THERE I THOUGHT LIES THE MYSTERY CONSIDERING THAT THEY WERE NOT
GIVEN YOU BY MRS
CHOLMONDELEY AND THAT YOUR OWN MEANS ARE LIMITED TO
A FEW SHILLINGS OF WHICH I KNOW YOU TO BE EXCESSIVELY CAREFUL
ECOUTEZ SHE WENT ON DRAWING NEAR AND SPEAKING IN HER MOST
CONFIDENTIAL AND COAXING TONE FOR MY SULKINESS WAS INCONVENIENT TO
HER SHE LIKED ME TO BE IN A TALKING AND LISTENING MOOD EVEN IF I ONLY
TALKED TO CHIDE AND LISTENED TO RAIL
ECOUTEZ CHRE GROGNEUSE I WILL
TELL YOU ALL HOW AND ABOUT IT AND YOU WILL THEN SEE NOT ONLY HOW
RIGHT THE WHOLE THING IS BUT HOW CLEVERLY MANAGED
IN THE FIRST PLACE
I MUST GO OUT
PAPA HIMSELF SAID THAT HE WISHED ME TO SEE SOMETHING
OF THE WORLD HE PARTICULARLY REMARKED TO MRS
CHOLMONDELEY THAT
THOUGH I WAS A SWEET CREATURE ENOUGH I HAD RATHER A
BREAD AND BUTTER EATING SCHOOL GIRL AIR OF WHICH IT WAS HIS SPECIAL
DESIRE THAT I SHOULD GET RID BY AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIETY HERE
BEFORE I MAKE MY REGULAR DBUT IN ENGLAND
WELL THEN IF I GO OUT I
MUST DRESS
MRS
CHOLMONDELEY IS TURNED SHABBY AND WILL GIVE NOTHING
MORE IT WOULD BE TOO HARD UPON UNCLE TO MAKE HIM PAY FOR ALL THE
THINGS I NEED THAT YOU CAN'T DENY THAT AGREES WITH YOUR OWN
PREACHMENTS
WELL BUT SOMEBODY WHO HEARD ME QUITE BY CHANCE I ASSURE
YOU COMPLAINING TO MRS
CHOLMONDELEY OF MY DISTRESSED CIRCUMSTANCES
AND WHAT STRAITS I WAS PUT TO FOR AN ORNAMENT OR TWO SOMEBODY FAR
FROM GRUDGING ONE A PRESENT WAS QUITE DELIGHTED AT THE IDEA OF BEING
PERMITTED TO OFFER SOME TRIFLE
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT A BLANC BEC
HE LOOKED WHEN HE FIRST SPOKE OF IT HOW HE HESITATED AND BLUSHED AND
POSITIVELY TREMBLED FROM FEAR OF A REPULSE
THAT WILL DO MISS FANSHAWE
I SUPPOSE I AM TO UNDERSTAND THAT M
ISIDORE IS THE BENEFACTOR THAT IT IS FROM HIM YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THAT
COSTLY PARURE THAT HE SUPPLIES YOUR BOUQUETS AND YOUR GLOVES
YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF SO DISAGREEABLY SAID SHE ONE HARDLY KNOWS HOW
TO ANSWER WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS THAT I OCCASIONALLY ALLOW ISIDORE THE
PLEASURE AND HONOUR OF EXPRESSING HIS HOMAGE BY THE OFFER OF A TRIFLE
IT COMES TO THE SAME THING
NOW GINEVRA TO SPEAK THE PLAIN TRUTH
I DON'T VERY WELL UNDERSTAND THESE MATTERS BUT I BELIEVE YOU ARE DOING
VERY WRONG SERIOUSLY WRONG
PERHAPS HOWEVER YOU NOW FEEL CERTAIN
THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MARRY M
ISIDORE YOUR PARENTS AND UNCLE HAVE
GIVEN THEIR CONSENT AND FOR YOUR PART YOU LOVE HIM ENTIRELY
MAIS PAS DU TOUT SHE ALWAYS HAD RECOURSE TO FRENCH WHEN ABOUT TO
SAY SOMETHING SPECIALLY HEARTLESS AND PERVERSE
JE SUIS SA REINE
MAIS IL N'EST PAS MON ROI
EXCUSE ME I MUST BELIEVE THIS LANGUAGE IS MERE NONSENSE AND COQUETRY
THERE IS NOTHING GREAT ABOUT YOU YET YOU ARE ABOVE PROFITING BY THE
GOOD NATURE AND PURSE OF A MAN TO WHOM YOU FEEL ABSOLUTE INDIFFERENCE
YOU LOVE M
ISIDORE FAR MORE THAN YOU THINK OR WILL AVOW
NO
I DANCED WITH A YOUNG OFFICER THE OTHER NIGHT WHOM I LOVE A
THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN HE
I OFTEN WONDER WHY I FEEL SO VERY COLD TO
ISIDORE FOR EVERYBODY SAYS HE IS HANDSOME AND OTHER LADIES ADMIRE
HIM BUT SOMEHOW HE BORES ME LET ME SEE NOW HOW IT IS
AND SHE SEEMED TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO REFLECT
IN THIS I ENCOURAGED HER
YES I SAID TRY TO GET A CLEAR IDEA OF THE STATE OF YOUR MIND
TO
ME IT SEEMS IN A GREAT MESS CHAOTIC AS A RAG BAG
IT IS SOMETHING IN THIS FASHION SHE CRIED OUT ERE LONG THE MAN IS
TOO ROMANTIC AND DEVOTED AND HE EXPECTS SOMETHING MORE OF ME THAN I
FIND IT CONVENIENT TO BE
HE THINKS I AM PERFECT FURNISHED WITH ALL
SORTS OF STERLING QUALITIES AND SOLID VIRTUES SUCH AS I NEVER HAD NOR
INTEND TO HAVE
NOW ONE CAN'T HELP IN HIS PRESENCE RATHER TRYING TO
JUSTIFY HIS GOOD OPINION AND IT DOES SO TIRE ONE TO BE GOODY AND TO
TALK SENSE FOR HE REALLY THINKS I AM SENSIBLE
I AM FAR MORE AT MY
EASE WITH YOU OLD LADY YOU YOU DEAR CROSSPATCH WHO TAKE ME AT MY
LOWEST AND KNOW ME TO BE COQUETTISH AND IGNORANT AND FLIRTING AND
FICKLE AND SILLY AND SELFISH AND ALL THE OTHER SWEET THINGS YOU AND
I HAVE AGREED TO BE A PART OF MY CHARACTER
THIS IS ALL VERY WELL I SAID MAKING A STRENUOUS EFFORT TO PRESERVE
THAT GRAVITY AND SEVERITY WHICH RAN RISK OF BEING SHAKEN BY THIS
WHIMSICAL CANDOUR BUT IT DOES NOT ALTER THAT WRETCHED BUSINESS OF THE
PRESENTS
PACK THEM UP GINEVRA LIKE A GOOD HONEST GIRL AND SEND
THEM BACK
INDEED I WON'T SAID SHE STOUTLY
THEN YOU ARE DECEIVING M
ISIDORE
IT STANDS TO REASON THAT BY
ACCEPTING HIS PRESENTS YOU GIVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND HE WILL ONE DAY
RECEIVE AN EQUIVALENT IN YOUR REGARD
BUT HE WON'T SHE INTERRUPTED HE HAS HIS EQUIVALENT NOW IN THE
PLEASURE OF SEEING ME WEAR THEM QUITE ENOUGH FOR HIM HE IS ONLY
BOURGEOIS
THIS PHRASE IN ITS SENSELESS ARROGANCE QUITE CURED ME OF THE
TEMPORARY WEAKNESS WHICH HAD MADE ME RELAX MY TONE AND ASPECT
SHE
RATTLED ON
MY PRESENT BUSINESS IS TO ENJOY YOUTH AND NOT TO THINK OF FETTERING
MYSELF BY PROMISE OR VOW TO THIS MAN OR THAT
WHEN FIRST I SAW
ISIDORE I BELIEVED HE WOULD HELP ME TO ENJOY IT I BELIEVED HE WOULD BE
CONTENT WITH MY BEING A PRETTY GIRL AND THAT WE SHOULD MEET AND PART
AND FLUTTER ABOUT LIKE TWO BUTTERFLIES AND BE HAPPY
LO AND BEHOLD I
FIND HIM AT TIMES AS GRAVE AS A JUDGE AND DEEP FEELING AND THOUGHTFUL
BAH LES PENSEURS LES HOMMES PROFONDS ET PASSIONNS NE SONT PAS MON
GOT
LE COLONEL ALFRED DE HAMAL SUITS ME FAR BETTER
VA POUR LES BEAUX
FATS ET LES JOLIS FRIPONS VIVE LES JOIES ET LES PLAISIRS A BAS LES
GRANDES PASSIONS ET LES SVRES VERTUS
SHE LOOKED FOR AN ANSWER TO THIS TIRADE
I GAVE NONE
J'AIME MON BEAU COLONEL SHE WENT ON JE N'AIMERAI JAMAIS SON RIVAL
JE NE SERAI JAMAIS FEMME DE BOURGEOIS MOI
I NOW SIGNIFIED THAT IT WAS IMPERATIVELY NECESSARY MY APARTMENT SHOULD
BE RELIEVED OF THE HONOUR OF HER PRESENCE SHE WENT AWAY LAUGHING
CHAPTER X
DR JOHN
MADAME BECK WAS A MOST CONSISTENT CHARACTER FORBEARING WITH ALL THE
WORLD AND TENDER TO NO PART OF IT
HER OWN CHILDREN DREW HER INTO NO
DEVIATION FROM THE EVEN TENOR OF HER STOIC CALM
SHE WAS SOLICITOUS
ABOUT HER FAMILY VIGILANT FOR THEIR INTERESTS AND PHYSICAL WELL BEING
BUT SHE NEVER SEEMED TO KNOW THE WISH TO TAKE HER LITTLE CHILDREN UPON
HER LAP TO PRESS THEIR ROSY LIPS WITH HER OWN TO GATHER THEM IN A
GENIAL EMBRACE TO SHOWER ON THEM SOFTLY THE BENIGNANT CARESS THE
LOVING WORD
I HAVE WATCHED HER SOMETIMES SITTING IN THE GARDEN VIEWING THE LITTLE
BEES AFAR OFF AS THEY WALKED IN A DISTANT ALLEY WITH TRINETTE THEIR
BONNE IN HER MIEN SPOKE CARE AND PRUDENCE
I KNOW SHE OFTEN PONDERED
ANXIOUSLY WHAT SHE CALLED LEUR AVENIR BUT IF THE YOUNGEST A PUNY
AND DELICATE BUT ENGAGING CHILD CHANCING TO SPY HER BROKE FROM ITS
NURSE AND TODDLING DOWN THE WALK CAME ALL EAGER AND LAUGHING AND
PANTING TO CLASP HER KNEE MADAME WOULD JUST CALMLY PUT OUT ONE HAND
SO AS TO PREVENT INCONVENIENT CONCUSSION FROM THE CHILD'S SUDDEN ONSET
PRENDS GARDE MON ENFANT SHE WOULD SAY UNMOVED PATIENTLY PERMIT IT
TO STAND NEAR HER A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN WITHOUT SMILE OR KISS OR
ENDEARING SYLLABLE RISE AND LEAD IT BACK TO TRINETTE
HER DEMEANOUR TO THE ELDEST GIRL WAS EQUALLY CHARACTERISTIC IN ANOTHER
WAY
THIS WAS A VICIOUS CHILD
QUELLE PESTE QUE CETTE DSIRE QUEL
POISON QUE CET ENFANT L WERE THE EXPRESSIONS DEDICATED TO HER ALIKE
IN KITCHEN AND IN SCHOOLROOM
AMONGST HER OTHER ENDOWMENTS SHE BOASTED
AN EXQUISITE SKILL IN THE ART OF PROVOCATION SOMETIMES DRIVING HER
BONNE AND THE SERVANTS ALMOST WILD
SHE WOULD STEAL TO THEIR ATTICS
OPEN THEIR DRAWERS AND BOXES WANTONLY TEAR THEIR BEST CAPS AND SOIL
THEIR BEST SHAWLS SHE WOULD WATCH HER OPPORTUNITY TO GET AT THE BUFFET
OF THE SALLE MANGER WHERE SHE WOULD SMASH ARTICLES OF PORCELAIN OR
GLASS OR TO THE CUPBOARD OF THE STOREROOM WHERE SHE WOULD PLUNDER THE
PRESERVES DRINK THE SWEET WINE BREAK JARS AND BOTTLES AND SO
CONTRIVE AS TO THROW THE ONUS OF SUSPICION ON THE COOK AND THE
KITCHEN MAID
ALL THIS WHEN MADAME SAW AND OF WHICH WHEN SHE RECEIVED
REPORT HER SOLE OBSERVATION UTTERED WITH MATCHLESS SERENITY WAS
DSIRE A BESOIN D'UNE SURVEILLANCE TOUTE PARTICULIRE ACCORDINGLY
SHE KEPT THIS PROMISING OLIVE BRANCH A GOOD DEAL AT HER SIDE
NEVER
ONCE I BELIEVE DID SHE TELL HER FAITHFULLY OF HER FAULTS EXPLAIN THE
EVIL OF SUCH HABITS AND SHOW THE RESULTS WHICH MUST THENCE ENSUE
SURVEILLANCE MUST WORK THE WHOLE CURE
IT FAILED OF COURSE
DSIRE WAS
KEPT IN SOME MEASURE FROM THE SERVANTS BUT SHE TEASED AND PILLAGED HER
MAMMA INSTEAD
WHATEVER BELONGING TO MADAME'S WORK TABLE OR TOILET SHE
COULD LAY HER HANDS ON SHE STOLE AND HID
MADAME SAW ALL THIS BUT SHE
STILL PRETENDED NOT TO SEE SHE HAD NOT RECTITUDE OF SOUL TO CONFRONT
THE CHILD WITH HER VICES
WHEN AN ARTICLE DISAPPEARED WHOSE VALUE
RENDERED RESTITUTION NECESSARY SHE WOULD PROFESS TO THINK THAT DSIRE
HAD TAKEN IT AWAY IN PLAY AND BEG HER TO RESTORE IT
DSIRE WAS NOT
TO BE SO CHEATED SHE HAD LEARNED TO BRING FALSEHOOD TO THE AID OF
THEFT AND WOULD DENY HAVING TOUCHED THE BROOCH RING OR SCISSORS
CARRYING ON THE HOLLOW SYSTEM THE MOTHER WOULD CALMLY ASSUME AN AIR OF
BELIEF AND AFTERWARDS CEASELESSLY WATCH AND DOG THE CHILD TILL SHE
TRACKED HER TO HER HIDING PLACES SOME HOLE IN THE GARDEN WALL SOME
CHINK OR CRANNY IN GARRET OR OUT HOUSE
THIS DONE MADAME WOULD SEND
DSIRE OUT FOR A WALK WITH HER BONNE AND PROFIT BY HER ABSENCE TO
ROB THE ROBBER
DSIRE PROVED HERSELF THE TRUE DAUGHTER OF HER ASTUTE
PARENT BY NEVER SUFFERING EITHER HER COUNTENANCE OR MANNER TO BETRAY
THE LEAST SIGN OF MORTIFICATION ON DISCOVERING THE LOSS
THE SECOND CHILD FIFINE WAS SAID TO BE LIKE ITS DEAD FATHER
CERTAINLY THOUGH THE MOTHER HAD GIVEN IT HER HEALTHY FRAME HER BLUE
EYE AND RUDDY CHEEK NOT FROM HER WAS DERIVED ITS MORAL BEING
IT WAS
AN HONEST GLEEFUL LITTLE SOUL A PASSIONATE WARM TEMPERED BUSTLING
CREATURE IT WAS TOO AND OF THE SORT LIKELY TO BLUNDER OFTEN INTO
PERILS AND DIFFICULTIES
ONE DAY IT BETHOUGHT ITSELF TO FALL FROM TOP
TO BOTTOM OF A STEEP FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AND WHEN MADAME HEARING
THE NOISE SHE ALWAYS HEARD EVERY NOISE ISSUED FROM THE
SALLE MANGER AND PICKED IT UP SHE SAID QUIETLY CET ENFANT A UN OS
CASS
AT FIRST WE HOPED THIS WAS NOT THE CASE
IT WAS HOWEVER BUT TOO TRUE
ONE LITTLE PLUMP ARM HUNG POWERLESS
LET MEESS MEANING ME TAKE HER SAID MADAME ET QU'ON AILLE TOUT
DE SUITE CHERCHER UN FIACRE
IN A FIACRE SHE PROMPTLY BUT WITH ADMIRABLE COOLNESS AND
SELF POSSESSION DEPARTED TO FETCH A SURGEON
IT APPEARED SHE DID NOT FIND THE FAMILY SURGEON AT HOME BUT THAT
MATTERED NOT SHE SOUGHT UNTIL SHE LAID HER HAND ON A SUBSTITUTE TO HER
MIND AND BROUGHT HIM BACK WITH HER
MEANTIME I HAD CUT THE CHILD'S
SLEEVE FROM ITS ARM UNDRESSED AND PUT IT TO BED
WE NONE OF US I SUPPOSE BY WE I MEAN THE BONNE THE COOK THE
PORTRESS AND MYSELF ALL WHICH PERSONAGES WERE NOW GATHERED IN THE
SMALL AND HEATED CHAMBER LOOKED VERY SCRUTINIZINGLY AT THE NEW DOCTOR
WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM
I AT LEAST WAS TAKEN UP WITH ENDEAVOURING
TO SOOTHE FIFINE WHOSE CRIES FOR SHE HAD GOOD LUNGS WERE APPALLING
TO HEAR
THESE CRIES REDOUBLED IN INTENSITY AS THE STRANGER APPROACHED
HER BED WHEN HE TOOK HER UP LET ALONE SHE CRIED PASSIONATELY IN
HER BROKEN ENGLISH FOR SHE SPOKE ENGLISH AS DID THE OTHER CHILDREN
I WILL NOT YOU I WILL DR
PILLULE
AND DR
PILLULE IS MY VERY GOOD FRIEND WAS THE ANSWER IN PERFECT
ENGLISH BUT HE IS BUSY AT A PLACE THREE LEAGUES OFF AND I AM COME IN
HIS STEAD
SO NOW WHEN WE GET A LITTLE CALMER WE MUST COMMENCE
BUSINESS AND WE WILL SOON HAVE THAT UNLUCKY LITTLE ARM BANDAGED AND IN
RIGHT ORDER
HEREUPON HE CALLED FOR A GLASS OF EAU SUCRE FED HER WITH SOME
TEASPOONFULS OF THE SWEET LIQUID FIFINE WAS A FRANK GOURMANDE ANYBODY
COULD WIN HER HEART THROUGH HER PALATE PROMISED HER MORE WHEN THE
OPERATION SHOULD BE OVER AND PROMPTLY WENT TO WORK
SOME ASSISTANCE
BEING NEEDED HE DEMANDED IT OF THE COOK A ROBUST STRONG ARMED WOMAN
BUT SHE THE PORTRESS AND THE NURSE INSTANTLY FLED
I DID NOT LIKE TO
TOUCH THAT SMALL TORTURED LIMB BUT THINKING THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE
MY HAND WAS ALREADY EXTENDED TO DO WHAT WAS REQUISITE
I WAS
ANTICIPATED MADAME BECK HAD PUT OUT HER OWN HAND HERS WAS STEADY
WHILE MINE TREMBLED
CA VAUDRA MIEUX SAID THE DOCTOR TURNING FROM ME TO HER
HE SHOWED WISDOM IN HIS CHOICE
MINE WOULD HAVE BEEN FEIGNED STOICISM
FORCED FORTITUDE
HERS WAS NEITHER FORCED NOR FEIGNED
MERCI MADAME TRS BIEN FORT BIEN SAID THE OPERATOR WHEN HE HAD
FINISHED
VOIL UN SANG FROID BIEN OPPORTUN ET QUI VAUT MILLE LANS
DE SENSIBILIT DPLACE
HE WAS PLEASED WITH HER FIRMNESS SHE WITH HIS COMPLIMENT
IT WAS
LIKELY TOO THAT HIS WHOLE GENERAL APPEARANCE HIS VOICE MIEN AND
MANNER WROUGHT IMPRESSIONS IN HIS FAVOUR
INDEED WHEN YOU LOOKED WELL
AT HIM AND WHEN A LAMP WAS BROUGHT IN FOR IT WAS EVENING AND NOW
WAXING DUSK YOU SAW THAT UNLESS MADAME BECK HAD BEEN LESS THAN WOMAN
IT COULD NOT WELL BE OTHERWISE
THIS YOUNG DOCTOR HE WAS YOUNG HAD
NO COMMON ASPECT
HIS STATURE LOOKED IMPOSINGLY TALL IN THAT LITTLE
CHAMBER AND AMIDST THAT GROUP OF DUTCH MADE WOMEN HIS PROFILE WAS
CLEAR FINE AND EXPRESSIVE PERHAPS HIS EYE GLANCED FROM FACE TO FACE
RATHER TOO VIVIDLY TOO QUICKLY AND TOO OFTEN BUT IT HAD A MOST
PLEASANT CHARACTER AND SO HAD HIS MOUTH HIS CHIN WAS FULL CLEFT
GRECIAN AND PERFECT
AS TO HIS SMILE ONE COULD NOT IN A HURRY MAKE UP
ONE'S MIND AS TO THE DESCRIPTIVE EPITHET IT MERITED THERE WAS
SOMETHING IN IT THAT PLEASED BUT SOMETHING TOO THAT BROUGHT SURGING UP
INTO THE MIND ALL ONE'S FOIBLES AND WEAK POINTS ALL THAT COULD LAY ONE
OPEN TO A LAUGH
YET FIFINE LIKED THIS DOUBTFUL SMILE AND THOUGHT THE
OWNER GENIAL MUCH AS HE HAD HURT HER SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO BID HIM
A FRIENDLY GOOD NIGHT
HE PATTED THE LITTLE HAND KINDLY AND THEN HE
AND MADAME WENT DOWN STAIRS TOGETHER SHE TALKING IN HER HIGHEST TIDE
OF SPIRITS AND VOLUBILITY HE LISTENING WITH AN AIR OF GOOD NATURED
AMENITY DASHED WITH THAT UNCONSCIOUS ROGUISH ARCHNESS I FIND IT
DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE
I NOTICED THAT THOUGH HE SPOKE FRENCH WELL HE SPOKE ENGLISH BETTER HE
HAD TOO AN ENGLISH COMPLEXION EYES AND FORM
I NOTICED MORE
AS HE
PASSED ME IN LEAVING THE ROOM TURNING HIS FACE IN MY DIRECTION ONE
MOMENT NOT TO ADDRESS ME BUT TO SPEAK TO MADAME YET SO STANDING
THAT I ALMOST NECESSARILY LOOKED UP AT HIM A RECOLLECTION WHICH HAD
BEEN STRUGGLING TO FORM IN MY MEMORY SINCE THE FIRST MOMENT I HEARD
HIS VOICE STARTED UP PERFECTED
THIS WAS THE VERY GENTLEMAN TO WHOM I
HAD SPOKEN AT THE BUREAU WHO HAD HELPED ME IN THE MATTER OF THE TRUNK
WHO HAD BEEN MY GUIDE THROUGH THE DARK WET PARK
LISTENING AS HE
PASSED DOWN THE LONG VESTIBULE OUT INTO THE STREET I RECOGNISED HIS
VERY TREAD IT WAS THE SAME FIRM AND EQUAL STRIDE I HAD FOLLOWED UNDER
THE DRIPPING TREES
IT WAS TO BE CONCLUDED THAT THIS YOUNG SURGEON PHYSICIAN'S FIRST VISIT
TO THE RUE FOSSETTE WOULD BE THE LAST
THE RESPECTABLE DR
PILLULE
BEING EXPECTED HOME THE NEXT DAY THERE APPEARED NO REASON WHY HIS
TEMPORARY SUBSTITUTE SHOULD AGAIN REPRESENT HIM BUT THE FATES HAD
WRITTEN THEIR DECREE TO THE CONTRARY
DR
PILLULE HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO SEE A RICH OLD HYPOCHONDRIAC AT THE
ANTIQUE UNIVERSITY TOWN OF BOUQUIN MOISI AND UPON HIS PRESCRIBING
CHANGE OF AIR AND TRAVEL AS REMEDIES HE WAS RETAINED TO ACCOMPANY THE
TIMID PATIENT ON A TOUR OF SOME WEEKS IT BUT REMAINED THEREFORE FOR
THE NEW DOCTOR TO CONTINUE HIS ATTENDANCE AT THE RUE FOSSETTE
I OFTEN SAW HIM WHEN HE CAME FOR MADAME WOULD NOT TRUST THE LITTLE
INVALID TO TRINETTE BUT REQUIRED ME TO SPEND MUCH OF MY TIME IN THE
NURSERY
I THINK HE WAS SKILFUL
FIFINE RECOVERED RAPIDLY UNDER HIS
CARE YET EVEN HER CONVALESCENCE DID NOT HASTEN HIS DISMISSAL
DESTINY
AND MADAME BECK SEEMED IN LEAGUE AND BOTH HAD RULED THAT HE SHOULD
MAKE DELIBERATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE VESTIBULE THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE
AND UPPER CHAMBERS OF THE RUE FOSSETTE
NO SOONER DID FIFINE EMERGE FROM HIS HANDS THAN DSIRE DECLARED
HERSELF ILL
THAT POSSESSED CHILD HAD A GENIUS FOR SIMULATION AND
CAPTIVATED BY THE ATTENTIONS AND INDULGENCES OF A SICK ROOM SHE CAME
TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AN ILLNESS WOULD PERFECTLY ACCOMMODATE HER
TASTES AND TOOK HER BED ACCORDINGLY
SHE ACTED WELL AND HER MOTHER
STILL BETTER FOR WHILE THE WHOLE CASE WAS TRANSPARENT TO MADAME BECK
AS THE DAY SHE TREATED IT WITH AN ASTONISHINGLY WELL ASSURED AIR OF
GRAVITY AND GOOD FAITH
WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THAT DR
JOHN SO THE YOUNG ENGLISHMAN HAD
TAUGHT FIFINE TO CALL HIM AND WE ALL TOOK FROM HER THE HABIT OF
ADDRESSING HIM BY THIS NAME TILL IT BECAME AN ESTABLISHED CUSTOM AND
HE WAS KNOWN BY NO OTHER IN THE RUE FOSSETTE THAT DR
JOHN CONSENTED
TACITLY TO ADOPT MADAME'S TACTICS AND TO FALL IN WITH HER MANOEUVRES
HE BETRAYED INDEED A PERIOD OF COMIC DOUBT CAST ONE OR TWO RAPID
GLANCES FROM THE CHILD TO THE MOTHER INDULGED IN AN INTERVAL OF
SELF CONSULTATION BUT FINALLY RESIGNED HIMSELF WITH A GOOD GRACE TO
PLAY HIS PART IN THE FARCE
DSIRE EAT LIKE A RAVEN GAMBOLLED DAY AND
NIGHT IN HER BED PITCHED TENTS WITH THE SHEETS AND BLANKETS LOUNGED
LIKE A TURK AMIDST PILLOWS AND BOLSTERS DIVERTED HERSELF WITH THROWING
HER SHOES AT HER BONNE AND GRIMACING AT HER SISTERS OVER FLOWED IN
SHORT WITH UNMERITED HEALTH AND EVIL SPIRITS ONLY LANGUISHING WHEN
HER MAMMA AND THE PHYSICIAN PAID THEIR DIURNAL VISIT
MADAME BECK I
KNEW WAS GLAD AT ANY PRICE TO HAVE HER DAUGHTER IN BED OUT OF THE
WAY OF MISCHIEF BUT I WONDERED THAT DR
JOHN DID NOT TIRE OF THE
BUSINESS
EVERY DAY ON THIS MERE PRETEXT OF A MOTIVE HE GAVE PUNCTUAL
ATTENDANCE MADAME ALWAYS RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SAME EMPRESSEMENT THE
SAME SUNSHINE FOR HIMSELF THE SAME ADMIRABLY COUNTERFEITED AIR OF
CONCERN FOR HER CHILD
DR
JOHN WROTE HARMLESS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THE
PATIENT AND VIEWED HER MOTHER WITH A SHREWDLY SPARKLING EYE
MADAME
CAUGHT HIS RALLYING LOOKS WITHOUT RESENTING THEM SHE HAD TOO MUCH GOOD
SENSE FOR THAT
SUPPLE AS THE YOUNG DOCTOR SEEMED ONE COULD NOT
DESPISE HIM THIS PLIANT PART WAS EVIDENTLY NOT ADOPTED IN THE DESIGN
TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH HIS EMPLOYER WHILE HE LIKED HIS OFFICE AT THE
PENSIONNAT AND LINGERED STRANGELY ABOUT THE RUE FOSSETTE HE WAS
INDEPENDENT ALMOST CARELESS IN HIS CARRIAGE THERE AND YET TOO HE
WAS OFTEN THOUGHTFUL AND PREOCCUPIED
IT WAS NOT PERHAPS MY BUSINESS TO OBSERVE THE MYSTERY OF HIS BEARING
OR SEARCH OUT ITS ORIGIN OR AIM BUT PLACED AS I WAS I COULD HARDLY
HELP IT
HE LAID HIMSELF OPEN TO MY OBSERVATION ACCORDING TO MY
PRESENCE IN THE ROOM JUST THAT DEGREE OF NOTICE AND CONSEQUENCE A
PERSON OF MY EXTERIOR HABITUALLY EXPECTS THAT IS TO SAY ABOUT WHAT IS
GIVEN TO UNOBTRUSIVE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE CHAIRS OF ORDINARY JOINER'S
WORK AND CARPETS OF NO STRIKING PATTERN
OFTEN WHILE WAITING FOR
MADAME HE WOULD MUSE SMILE WATCH OR LISTEN LIKE A MAN WHO THINKS
HIMSELF ALONE
I MEANTIME WAS FREE TO PUZZLE OVER HIS COUNTENANCE AND
MOVEMENTS AND WONDER WHAT COULD BE THE MEANING OF THAT PECULIAR
INTEREST AND ATTACHMENT ALL MIXED UP WITH DOUBT AND STRANGENESS AND
INEXPLICABLY RULED BY SOME PRESIDING SPELL WHICH WEDDED HIM TO THIS
DEMI CONVENT SECLUDED IN THE BUILT UP CORE OF A CAPITAL
HE I
BELIEVE NEVER REMEMBERED THAT I HAD EYES IN MY HEAD MUCH LESS A BRAIN
BEHIND THEM
NOR WOULD HE EVER HAVE FOUND THIS OUT BUT THAT ONE DAY WHILE HE SAT
IN THE SUNSHINE AND I WAS OBSERVING THE COLOURING OF HIS HAIR
WHISKERS AND COMPLEXION THE WHOLE BEING OF SUCH A TONE AS A STRONG
LIGHT BRINGS OUT WITH SOMEWHAT PERILOUS FORCE INDEED I RECOLLECT I WAS
DRIVEN TO COMPARE HIS BEAMY HEAD IN MY THOUGHTS TO THAT OF THE GOLDEN
IMAGE WHICH NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE KING HAD SET UP AN IDEA NEW SUDDEN
AND STARTLING RIVETED MY ATTENTION WITH AN OVER MASTERING STRENGTH AND
POWER OF ATTRACTION
I KNOW NOT TO THIS DAY HOW I LOOKED AT HIM THE
FORCE OF SURPRISE AND ALSO OF CONVICTION MADE ME FORGET MYSELF AND I
ONLY RECOVERED WONTED CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN I SAW THAT HIS NOTICE WAS
ARRESTED AND THAT IT HAD CAUGHT MY MOVEMENT IN A CLEAR LITTLE OVAL
MIRROR FIXED IN THE SIDE OF THE WINDOW RECESS BY THE AID OF WHICH
REFLECTOR MADAME OFTEN SECRETLY SPIED PERSONS WALKING IN THE GARDEN
BELOW
THOUGH OF SO GAY AND SANGUINE A TEMPERAMENT HE WAS NOT WITHOUT
A CERTAIN NERVOUS SENSITIVENESS WHICH MADE HIM ILL AT EASE UNDER A
DIRECT INQUIRING GAZE
ON SURPRISING ME THUS HE TURNED AND SAID IN A
TONE WHICH THOUGH COURTEOUS HAD JUST SO MUCH DRYNESS IN IT AS TO MARK
A SHADE OF ANNOYANCE AS WELL AS TO GIVE TO WHAT WAS SAID THE CHARACTER
OF REBUKE MADEMOISELLE DOES NOT SPARE ME I AM NOT VAIN ENOUGH TO
FANCY THAT IT IS MY MERITS WHICH ATTRACT HER ATTENTION IT MUST THEN BE
SOME DEFECT
DARE I ASK WHAT
I WAS CONFOUNDED AS THE READER MAY SUPPOSE YET NOT WITH AN
IRRECOVERABLE CONFUSION BEING CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS FROM NO EMOTION OF
INCAUTIOUS ADMIRATION NOR YET IN A SPIRIT OF UNJUSTIFIABLE
INQUISITIVENESS THAT I HAD INCURRED THIS REPROOF
I MIGHT HAVE CLEARED
MYSELF ON THE SPOT BUT WOULD NOT
I DID NOT SPEAK
I WAS NOT IN THE
HABIT OF SPEAKING TO HIM
SUFFERING HIM THEN TO THINK WHAT HE CHOSE
AND ACCUSE ME OF WHAT HE WOULD I RESUMED SOME WORK I HAD DROPPED AND
KEPT MY HEAD BENT OVER IT DURING THE REMAINDER OF HIS STAY
THERE IS A
PERVERSE MOOD OF THE MIND WHICH IS RATHER SOOTHED THAN IRRITATED BY
MISCONSTRUCTION AND IN QUARTERS WHERE WE CAN NEVER BE RIGHTLY KNOWN
WE TAKE PLEASURE I THINK IN BEING CONSUMMATELY IGNORED
WHAT HONEST
MAN ON BEING CASUALLY TAKEN FOR A HOUSEBREAKER DOES NOT FEEL RATHER
TICKLED THAN VEXED AT THE MISTAKE
CHAPTER XI
THE PORTRESS'S CABINET
IT WAS SUMMER AND VERY HOT
GEORGETTE THE YOUNGEST OF MADAME BECK'S
CHILDREN TOOK A FEVER
DSIRE SUDDENLY CURED OF HER AILMENTS WAS
TOGETHER WITH FIFINE PACKED OFF TO BONNE MAMAN IN THE COUNTRY BY WAY
OF PRECAUTION AGAINST INFECTION
MEDICAL AID WAS NOW REALLY NEEDED AND
MADAME CHOOSING TO IGNORE THE RETURN OF DR
PILLULE WHO HAD BEEN AT
HOME A WEEK CONJURED HIS ENGLISH RIVAL TO CONTINUE HIS VISITS
ONE OR
TWO OF THE PENSIONNAIRES COMPLAINED OF HEADACHE AND IN OTHER RESPECTS
SEEMED SLIGHTLY TO PARTICIPATE IN GEORGETTE'S AILMENT
NOW AT LAST
I THOUGHT DR
PILLULE MUST BE RECALLED THE PRUDENT DIRECTRESS WILL
NEVER VENTURE TO PERMIT THE ATTENDANCE OF SO YOUNG A MAN ON THE PUPILS
THE DIRECTRESS WAS VERY PRUDENT BUT SHE COULD ALSO BE INTREPIDLY
VENTUROUS
SHE ACTUALLY INTRODUCED DR
JOHN TO THE SCHOOL DIVISION OF
THE PREMISES AND ESTABLISHED HIM IN ATTENDANCE ON THE PROUD AND
HANDSOME BLANCHE DE MELCY AND THE VAIN FLIRTING ANGLIQUE HER
FRIEND
DR
JOHN I THOUGHT TESTIFIED A CERTAIN GRATIFICATION AT THIS
MARK OF CONFIDENCE AND IF DISCRETION OF BEARING COULD HAVE JUSTIFIED
THE STEP IT WOULD BY HIM HAVE BEEN AMPLY JUSTIFIED
HERE HOWEVER IN
THIS LAND OF CONVENTS AND CONFESSIONALS SUCH A PRESENCE AS HIS WAS NOT
TO BE SUFFERED WITH IMPUNITY IN A PENSIONNAT DE DEMOISELLES THE
SCHOOL GOSSIPED THE KITCHEN WHISPERED THE TOWN CAUGHT THE RUMOUR
PARENTS WROTE LETTERS AND PAID VISITS OF REMONSTRANCE
MADAME HAD SHE
BEEN WEAK WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN LOST A DOZEN RIVAL EDUCATIONAL HOUSES
WERE READY TO IMPROVE THIS FALSE STEP IF FALSE STEP IT WERE TO HER
RUIN BUT MADAME WAS NOT WEAK AND LITTLE JESUIT THOUGH SHE MIGHT BE
YET I CLAPPED THE HANDS OF MY HEART AND WITH ITS VOICE CRIED BRAVA
AS I WATCHED HER ABLE BEARING HER SKILLED MANAGEMENT HER TEMPER AND
HER FIRMNESS ON THIS OCCASION
SHE MET THE ALARMED PARENTS WITH A GOOD HUMOURED EASY GRACE FOR NOBODY
MATCHED HER IN I KNOW NOT WHETHER TO SAY THE POSSESSION OR THE
ASSUMPTION OF A CERTAIN RONDEUR ET FRANCHISE DE BONNE FEMME WHICH ON
VARIOUS OCCASIONS GAINED THE POINT AIMED AT WITH INSTANT AND COMPLETE
SUCCESS WHERE SEVERE GRAVITY AND SERIOUS REASONING WOULD PROBABLY HAVE
FAILED
CE PAUVRE DOCTEUR JEAN SHE WOULD SAY CHUCKLING AND RUBBING JOYOUSLY
HER FAT LITTLE WHITE HANDS CE CHER JEUNE HOMME LE MEILLEUR CRATURE
DU MONDE AND GO ON TO EXPLAIN HOW SHE HAPPENED TO BE EMPLOYING HIM
FOR HER OWN CHILDREN WHO WERE SO FOND OF HIM THEY WOULD SCREAM
THEMSELVES INTO FITS AT THE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER DOCTOR HOW WHERE SHE
HAD CONFIDENCE FOR HER OWN SHE THOUGHT IT NATURAL TO REPOSE TRUST FOR
OTHERS AND AU RESTE IT WAS ONLY THE MOST TEMPORARY EXPEDIENT IN THE
WORLD BLANCHE AND ANGLIQUE HAD THE MIGRAINE DR
JOHN HAD WRITTEN A
PRESCRIPTION VOIL TOUT
THE PARENTS' MOUTHS WERE CLOSED
BLANCHE AND ANGLIQUE SAVED HER ALL
REMAINING TROUBLE BY CHANTING LOUD DUETS IN THEIR PHYSICIAN'S PRAISE
THE OTHER PUPILS ECHOED THEM UNANIMOUSLY DECLARING THAT WHEN THEY WERE
ILL THEY WOULD HAVE DR
JOHN AND NOBODY ELSE AND MADAME LAUGHED AND
THE PARENTS LAUGHED TOO
THE LABASSECOURIENS MUST HAVE A LARGE ORGAN OF
PHILOPROGENITIVENESS AT LEAST THE INDULGENCE OF OFFSPRING IS CARRIED
BY THEM TO EXCESSIVE LENGTHS THE LAW OF MOST HOUSEHOLDS BEING THE
CHILDREN'S WILL
MADAME NOW GOT CREDIT FOR HAVING ACTED ON THIS
OCCASION IN A SPIRIT OF MOTHERLY PARTIALITY SHE CAME OFF WITH FLYING
COLOURS PEOPLE LIKED HER AS A DIRECTRESS BETTER THAN EVER
TO THIS DAY I NEVER FULLY UNDERSTOOD WHY SHE THUS RISKED HER INTEREST
FOR THE SAKE OF DR
JOHN
WHAT PEOPLE SAID OF COURSE I KNOW WELL THE
WHOLE HOUSE PUPILS TEACHERS SERVANTS INCLUDED AFFIRMED THAT SHE WAS
GOING TO MARRY HIM
SO THEY HAD SETTLED IT DIFFERENCE OF AGE SEEMED TO
MAKE NO OBSTACLE IN THEIR EYES IT WAS TO BE SO
IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT APPEARANCES DID NOT WHOLLY DISCOUNTENANCE THIS
IDEA MADAME SEEMED SO BENT ON RETAINING HIS SERVICES SO OBLIVIOUS OF
HER FORMER PROTG PILLULE
SHE MADE TOO SUCH A POINT OF PERSONALLY
RECEIVING HIS VISITS AND WAS SO UNFAILINGLY CHEERFUL BLITHE AND
BENIGNANT IN HER MANNER TO HIM
MOREOVER SHE PAID ABOUT THIS TIME
MARKED ATTENTION TO DRESS THE MORNING DISHABILLE THE NIGHTCAP AND
SHAWL WERE DISCARDED DR
JOHN'S EARLY VISITS ALWAYS FOUND HER WITH
AUBURN BRAIDS ALL NICELY ARRANGED SILK DRESS TRIMLY FITTED ON NEAT
LACED BRODEQUINS IN LIEU OF SLIPPERS IN SHORT THE WHOLE TOILETTE
COMPLETE AS A MODEL AND FRESH AS A FLOWER
I SCARCELY THINK HOWEVER
THAT HER INTENTION IN THIS WENT FURTHER THAN JUST TO SHOW A VERY
HANDSOME MAN THAT SHE WAS NOT QUITE A PLAIN WOMAN AND PLAIN SHE WAS
NOT
WITHOUT BEAUTY OF FEATURE OR ELEGANCE OF FORM SHE PLEASED
WITHOUT YOUTH AND ITS GAY GRACES SHE CHEERED
ONE NEVER TIRED OF
SEEING HER SHE WAS NEVER MONOTONOUS OR INSIPID OR COLOURLESS OR
FLAT
HER UNFADED HAIR HER EYE WITH ITS TEMPERATE BLUE LIGHT HER
CHEEK WITH ITS WHOLESOME FRUIT LIKE BLOOM THESE THINGS PLEASED IN
MODERATION BUT WITH CONSTANCY
HAD SHE INDEED FLOATING VISIONS OF ADOPTING DR
JOHN AS A HUSBAND
TAKING HIM TO HER WELL FURNISHED HOME ENDOWING HIM WITH HER SAVINGS
WHICH WERE SAID TO AMOUNT TO A MODERATE COMPETENCY AND MAKING HIM
COMFORTABLE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE DID DR
JOHN SUSPECT HER OF SUCH
VISIONS I HAVE MET HIM COMING OUT OF HER PRESENCE WITH A MISCHIEVOUS
HALF SMILE ABOUT HIS LIPS AND IN HIS EYES A LOOK AS OF MASCULINE
VANITY ELATE AND TICKLED
WITH ALL HIS GOOD LOOKS AND GOOD NATURE HE
WAS NOT PERFECT HE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY IMPERFECT IF HE ROGUISHLY
ENCOURAGED AIMS HE NEVER INTENDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL
BUT DID HE NOT
INTEND THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE SAID HE HAD NO MONEY THAT HE WAS
WHOLLY DEPENDENT UPON HIS PROFESSION
MADAME THOUGH PERHAPS SOME
FOURTEEN YEARS HIS SENIOR WAS YET THE SORT OF WOMAN NEVER TO GROW OLD
NEVER TO WITHER NEVER TO BREAK DOWN
THEY CERTAINLY WERE ON GOOD
TERMS
HE PERHAPS WAS NOT IN LOVE BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE EVER DO
LOVE OR AT LEAST MARRY FOR LOVE IN THIS WORLD
WE WAITED THE END
FOR WHAT HE WAITED I DO NOT KNOW NOR FOR WHAT HE WATCHED BUT THE
PECULIARITY OF HIS MANNER HIS EXPECTANT VIGILANT ABSORBED EAGER
LOOK NEVER WORE OFF IT RATHER INTENSIFIED
HE HAD NEVER BEEN QUITE
WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY PENETRATION AND I THINK HE RANGED FARTHER AND
FARTHER BEYOND IT
ONE MORNING LITTLE GEORGETTE HAD BEEN MORE FEVERISH AND CONSEQUENTLY
MORE PEEVISH SHE WAS CRYING AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
I THOUGHT A
PARTICULAR DRAUGHT ORDERED DISAGREED WITH HER AND I DOUBTED WHETHER
IT OUGHT TO BE CONTINUED I WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR THE DOCTOR'S COMING
IN ORDER TO CONSULT HIM
THE DOOR BELL RANG HE WAS ADMITTED I FELT SURE OF THIS FOR I HEARD
HIS VOICE ADDRESSING THE PORTRESS
IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO MOUNT STRAIGHT
TO THE NURSERY TAKING ABOUT THREE DEGREES OF THE STAIRCASE AT ONCE
AND COMING UPON US LIKE A CHEERFUL SURPRISE
FIVE MINUTES
ELAPSED TEN AND I SAW AND HEARD NOTHING OF HIM
WHAT COULD HE BE
DOING POSSIBLY WAITING IN THE CORRIDOR BELOW
LITTLE GEORGETTE STILL
PIPED HER PLAINTIVE WAIL APPEALING TO ME BY HER FAMILIAR TERM
MINNIE MINNIE ME VERY POORLY TILL MY HEART ACHED
I DESCENDED TO
ASCERTAIN WHY HE DID NOT COME
THE CORRIDOR WAS EMPTY
WHITHER WAS HE
VANISHED WAS HE WITH MADAME IN THE SALLE MANGER IMPOSSIBLE I HAD
LEFT HER BUT A SHORT TIME SINCE DRESSING IN HER OWN CHAMBER
I
LISTENED
THREE PUPILS WERE JUST THEN HARD AT WORK PRACTISING IN THREE
PROXIMATE ROOMS THE DINING ROOM AND THE GREATER AND LESSER
DRAWING ROOMS BETWEEN WHICH AND THE CORRIDOR THERE WAS BUT THE
PORTRESS'S CABINET COMMUNICATING WITH THE SALONS AND INTENDED
ORIGINALLY FOR A BOUDOIR
FARTHER OFF AT A FOURTH INSTRUMENT IN THE
ORATORY A WHOLE CLASS OF A DOZEN OR MORE WERE TAKING A SINGING LESSON
AND JUST THEN JOINING IN A BARCAROLE I THINK THEY CALLED IT
WHEREOF I YET REMEMBER THESE WORDS FRACH BRIS AND VENIS
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT COULD I HEAR A GREAT DEAL CERTAINLY
HAD IT ONLY BEEN TO THE PURPOSE
YES I HEARD A GIDDY TREBLE LAUGH IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED LITTLE
CABINET CLOSE BY THE DOOR OF WHICH I STOOD THAT DOOR HALF UNCLOSED A
MAN'S VOICE IN A SOFT DEEP PLEADING TONE UTTERED SOME WORDS
WHEREOF I ONLY CAUGHT THE ADJURATION FOR GOD'S SAKE THEN AFTER A
SECOND'S PAUSE FORTH ISSUED DR
JOHN HIS EYE FULL SHINING BUT NOT
WITH EITHER JOY OR TRIUMPH HIS FAIR ENGLISH CHEEK HIGH COLOURED A
BAFFLED TORTURED ANXIOUS AND YET A TENDER MEANING ON HIS BROW
THE OPEN DOOR SERVED ME AS A SCREEN BUT HAD I BEEN FULL IN HIS WAY I
BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE PASSED WITHOUT SEEING ME
SOME MORTIFICATION
SOME STRONG VEXATION HAD HOLD OF HIS SOUL OR RATHER TO WRITE MY
IMPRESSIONS NOW AS I RECEIVED THEM AT THE TIME I SHOULD SAY SOME
SORROW SOME SENSE OF INJUSTICE
I DID NOT SO MUCH THINK HIS PRIDE WAS
HURT AS THAT HIS AFFECTIONS HAD BEEN WOUNDED CRUELLY WOUNDED IT
SEEMED TO ME
BUT WHO WAS THE TORTURER WHAT BEING IN THAT HOUSE HAD
HIM SO MUCH IN HER POWER MADAME I BELIEVED TO BE IN HER CHAMBER THE
ROOM WHENCE HE HAD STEPPED WAS DEDICATED TO THE PORTRESS'S SOLE USE
AND SHE ROSINE MATOU AN UNPRINCIPLED THOUGH PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH
GRISETTE AIRY FICKLE DRESSY VAIN AND MERCENARY IT WAS NOT
SURELY TO HER HAND HE OWED THE ORDEAL THROUGH WHICH HE SEEMED TO
HAVE PASSED
BUT WHILE I PONDERED HER VOICE CLEAR THOUGH SOMEWHAT SHARP BROKE
OUT IN A LIGHTSOME FRENCH SONG TRILLING THROUGH THE DOOR STILL AJAR I
GLANCED IN DOUBTING MY SENSES
THERE AT THE TABLE SHE SAT IN A SMART
DRESS OF JACONAS ROSE TRIMMING A TINY BLOND CAP NOT A LIVING THING
SAVE HERSELF WAS IN THE ROOM EXCEPT INDEED SOME GOLD FISH IN A GLASS
GLOBE SOME FLOWERS IN POTS AND A BROAD JULY SUNBEAM
HERE WAS A PROBLEM BUT I MUST GO UP STAIRS TO ASK ABOUT THE MEDICINE
DR
JOHN SAT IN A CHAIR AT GEORGETTE'S BEDSIDE MADAME STOOD BEFORE
HIM THE LITTLE PATIENT HAD BEEN EXAMINED AND SOOTHED AND NOW LAY
COMPOSED IN HER CRIB
MADAME BECK AS I ENTERED WAS DISCUSSING THE
PHYSICIAN'S OWN HEALTH REMARKING ON SOME REAL OR FANCIED CHANGE IN HIS
LOOKS CHARGING HIM WITH OVER WORK AND RECOMMENDING REST AND CHANGE OF
AIR
HE LISTENED GOOD NATUREDLY BUT WITH LAUGHING INDIFFERENCE
TELLING HER THAT SHE WAS TROP BONNE AND THAT HE FELT PERFECTLY WELL
MADAME APPEALED TO ME DR
JOHN FOLLOWING HER MOVEMENT WITH A SLOW
GLANCE WHICH SEEMED TO EXPRESS LANGUID SURPRISE AT REFERENCE BEING MADE
TO A QUARTER SO INSIGNIFICANT
WHAT DO YOU THINK MISS LUCIE ASKED MADAME
IS HE NOT PALER AND
THINNER
IT WAS VERY SELDOM THAT I UTTERED MORE THAN MONOSYLLABLES IN DR
JOHN'S
PRESENCE HE WAS THE KIND OF PERSON WITH WHOM I WAS LIKELY EVER TO
REMAIN THE NEUTRAL PASSIVE THING HE THOUGHT ME
NOW HOWEVER I TOOK
LICENCE TO ANSWER IN A PHRASE AND A PHRASE I PURPOSELY MADE QUITE
SIGNIFICANT
HE LOOKS ILL AT THIS MOMENT BUT PERHAPS IT IS OWING TO SOME TEMPORARY
CAUSE DR
JOHN MAY HAVE BEEN VEXED OR HARASSED I CANNOT TELL HOW HE
TOOK THIS SPEECH AS I NEVER SOUGHT HIS FACE FOR INFORMATION
GEORGETTE
HERE BEGAN TO ASK ME IN HER BROKEN ENGLISH IF SHE MIGHT HAVE A GLASS OF
EAU SUCRE
I ANSWERED HER IN ENGLISH
FOR THE FIRST TIME I FANCY
HE NOTICED THAT I SPOKE HIS LANGUAGE HITHERTO HE HAD ALWAYS TAKEN ME
FOR A FOREIGNER ADDRESSING ME AS MADEMOISELLE AND GIVING IN FRENCH
THE REQUISITE DIRECTIONS ABOUT THE CHILDREN'S TREATMENT
HE SEEMED ON
THE POINT OF MAKING A REMARK BUT THINKING BETTER OF IT HELD HIS
TONGUE
MADAME RECOMMENCED ADVISING HIM HE SHOOK HIS HEAD LAUGHING ROSE AND
BID HER GOOD MORNING WITH COURTESY BUT STILL WITH THE REGARDLESS AIR
OF ONE WHOM TOO MUCH UNSOLICITED ATTENTION WAS SURFEITING AND SPOILING
WHEN HE WAS GONE MADAME DROPPED INTO THE CHAIR HE HAD JUST LEFT SHE
RESTED HER CHIN IN HER HAND ALL THAT WAS ANIMATED AND AMIABLE VANISHED
FROM HER FACE SHE LOOKED STONY AND STERN ALMOST MORTIFIED AND MOROSE
SHE SIGHED A SINGLE BUT A DEEP SIGH
A LOUD BELL RANG FOR
MORNING SCHOOL
SHE GOT UP AS SHE PASSED A DRESSING TABLE WITH A GLASS
UPON IT SHE LOOKED AT HER REFLECTED IMAGE
ONE SINGLE WHITE HAIR
STREAKED HER NUT BROWN TRESSES SHE PLUCKED IT OUT WITH A SHUDDER
IN
THE FULL SUMMER DAYLIGHT HER FACE THOUGH IT STILL HAD THE COLOUR
COULD PLAINLY BE SEEN TO HAVE LOST THE TEXTURE OF YOUTH AND THEN
WHERE WERE YOUTH'S CONTOURS AH MADAME WISE AS YOU WERE EVEN YOU
KNEW WEAKNESS
NEVER HAD I PITIED MADAME BEFORE BUT MY HEART SOFTENED
TOWARDS HER WHEN SHE TURNED DARKLY FROM THE GLASS
A CALAMITY HAD COME
UPON HER
THAT HAG DISAPPOINTMENT WAS GREETING HER WITH A GRISLY
ALL HAIL AND HER SOUL REJECTED THE INTIMACY
BUT ROSINE MY BEWILDERMENT THERE SURPASSES DESCRIPTION
I EMBRACED
FIVE OPPORTUNITIES OF PASSING HER CABINET THAT DAY WITH A VIEW TO
CONTEMPLATING HER CHARMS AND FINDING OUT THE SECRET OF THEIR
INFLUENCE
SHE WAS PRETTY YOUNG AND WORE A WELL MADE DRESS
ALL VERY
GOOD POINTS AND I SUPPOSE AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT IN ANY
PHILOSOPHIC MIND FOR ANY AMOUNT OF AGONY AND DISTRACTION IN A YOUNG
MAN LIKE DR
JOHN
STILL I COULD NOT HELP FORMING HALF A WISH THAT
THE SAID DOCTOR WERE MY BROTHER OR AT LEAST THAT HE HAD A SISTER OR A
MOTHER WHO WOULD KINDLY SERMONIZE HIM
I SAY HALF A WISH I BROKE IT
AND FLUNG IT AWAY BEFORE IT BECAME A WHOLE ONE DISCOVERING IN GOOD
TIME ITS EXQUISITE FOLLY
SOMEBODY I ARGUED MIGHT AS WELL
SERMONIZE MADAME ABOUT HER YOUNG PHYSICIAN AND WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT
DO
I BELIEVE MADAME SERMONIZED HERSELF
SHE DID NOT BEHAVE WEAKLY OR MAKE
HERSELF IN ANY SHAPE RIDICULOUS
IT IS TRUE SHE HAD NEITHER STRONG
FEELINGS TO OVERCOME NOR TENDER FEELINGS BY WHICH TO BE MISERABLY
PAINED
IT IS TRUE LIKEWISE THAT SHE HAD AN IMPORTANT AVOCATION A REAL
BUSINESS TO FILL HER TIME DIVERT HER THOUGHTS AND DIVIDE HER
INTEREST
IT IS ESPECIALLY TRUE THAT SHE POSSESSED A GENUINE GOOD SENSE
WHICH IS NOT GIVEN TO ALL WOMEN NOR TO ALL MEN AND BY DINT OF THESE
COMBINED ADVANTAGES SHE BEHAVED WISELY SHE BEHAVED WELL
BRAVA ONCE
MORE MADAME BECK
I SAW YOU MATCHED AGAINST AN APOLLYON OF A
PREDILECTION YOU FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT AND YOU OVERCAME
CHAPTER XII
THE CASKET
BEHIND THE HOUSE AT THE RUE FOSSETTE THERE WAS A GARDEN LARGE
CONSIDERING THAT IT LAY IN THE HEART OF A CITY AND TO MY RECOLLECTION
AT THIS DAY IT SEEMS PLEASANT BUT TIME LIKE DISTANCE LENDS TO
CERTAIN SCENES AN INFLUENCE SO SOFTENING AND WHERE ALL IS STONE
AROUND BLANK WALL AND HOT PAVEMENT HOW PRECIOUS SEEMS ONE SHRUB HOW
LOVELY AN ENCLOSED AND PLANTED SPOT OF GROUND
THERE WENT A TRADITION THAT MADAME BECK'S HOUSE HAD IN OLD DAYS BEEN A
CONVENT
THAT IN YEARS GONE BY HOW LONG GONE BY I CANNOT TELL BUT I
THINK SOME CENTURIES BEFORE THE CITY HAD OVER SPREAD THIS QUARTER AND
WHEN IT WAS TILLED GROUND AND AVENUE AND SUCH DEEP AND LEAFY SECLUSION
AS OUGHT TO EMBOSOM A RELIGIOUS HOUSE THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED ON
THIS SITE WHICH ROUSING FEAR AND INFLICTING HORROR HAD LEFT TO THE
PLACE THE INHERITANCE OF A GHOST STORY
A VAGUE TALE WENT OF A BLACK
AND WHITE NUN SOMETIMES ON SOME NIGHT OR NIGHTS OF THE YEAR SEEN IN
SOME PART OF THIS VICINAGE
THE GHOST MUST HAVE BEEN BUILT OUT SOME
AGES AGO FOR THERE WERE HOUSES ALL ROUND NOW BUT CERTAIN
CONVENT RELICS IN THE SHAPE OF OLD AND HUGE FRUIT TREES YET
CONSECRATED THE SPOT AND AT THE FOOT OF ONE A METHUSELAH OF A
PEAR TREE DEAD ALL BUT A FEW BOUGHS WHICH STILL FAITHFULLY RENEWED
THEIR PERFUMED SNOW IN SPRING AND THEIR HONEY SWEET PENDANTS IN
AUTUMN YOU SAW IN SCRAPING AWAY THE MOSSY EARTH BETWEEN THE
HALF BARED ROOTS A GLIMPSE OF SLAB SMOOTH HARD AND BLACK
THE
LEGEND WENT UNCONFIRMED AND UNACCREDITED BUT STILL PROPAGATED THAT
THIS WAS THE PORTAL OF A VAULT IMPRISONING DEEP BENEATH THAT GROUND
ON WHOSE SURFACE GRASS GREW AND FLOWERS BLOOMED THE BONES OF A GIRL
WHOM A MONKISH CONCLAVE OF THE DREAR MIDDLE AGES HAD HERE BURIED ALIVE
FOR SOME SIN AGAINST HER VOW
HER SHADOW IT WAS THAT TREMBLERS HAD
FEARED THROUGH LONG GENERATIONS AFTER HER POOR FRAME WAS DUST HER
BLACK ROBE AND WHITE VEIL THAT FOR TIMID EYES MOONLIGHT AND SHADE HAD
MOCKED AS THEY FLUCTUATED IN THE NIGHT WIND THROUGH THE GARDEN THICKET
INDEPENDENTLY OF ROMANTIC RUBBISH HOWEVER THAT OLD GARDEN HAD ITS
CHARMS
ON SUMMER MORNINGS I USED TO RISE EARLY TO ENJOY THEM ALONE
ON SUMMER EVENINGS TO LINGER SOLITARY TO KEEP TRYSTE WITH THE RISING
MOON OR TASTE ONE KISS OF THE EVENING BREEZE OR FANCY RATHER THAN
FEEL THE FRESHNESS OF DEW DESCENDING
THE TURF WAS VERDANT THE
GRAVELLED WALKS WERE WHITE SUN BRIGHT NASTURTIUMS CLUSTERED BEAUTIFUL
ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE DODDERED ORCHARD GIANTS
THERE WAS A LARGE
BERCEAU ABOVE WHICH SPREAD THE SHADE OF AN ACACIA THERE WAS A
SMALLER MORE SEQUESTERED BOWER NESTLED IN THE VINES WHICH RAN ALL
ALONG A HIGH AND GREY WALL AND GATHERED THEIR TENDRILS IN A KNOT OF
BEAUTY AND HUNG THEIR CLUSTERS IN LOVING PROFUSION ABOUT THE FAVOURED
SPOT WHERE JASMINE AND IVY MET AND MARRIED THEM
DOUBTLESS AT HIGH NOON IN THE BROAD VULGAR MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN
MADAME BECK'S LARGE SCHOOL TURNED OUT RAMPANT AND EXTERNES AND
PENSIONNAIRES WERE SPREAD ABROAD VYING WITH THE DENIZENS OF THE BOYS'
COLLEGE CLOSE AT HAND IN THE BRAZEN EXERCISE OF THEIR LUNGS AND
LIMBS DOUBTLESS THEN THE GARDEN WAS A TRITE TRODDEN DOWN PLACE
ENOUGH
BUT AT SUNSET OR THE HOUR OF SALUT WHEN THE EXTERNES WERE
GONE HOME AND THE BOARDERS QUIET AT THEIR STUDIES PLEASANT WAS IT
THEN TO STRAY DOWN THE PEACEFUL ALLEYS AND HEAR THE BELLS OF ST
JEAN
BAPTISTE PEAL OUT WITH THEIR SWEET SOFT EXALTED SOUND
I WAS WALKING THUS ONE EVENING AND HAD BEEN DETAINED FARTHER WITHIN
THE VERGE OF TWILIGHT THAN USUAL BY THE STILL DEEPENING CALM THE
MELLOW COOLNESS THE FRAGRANT BREATHING WITH WHICH FLOWERS NO SUNSHINE
COULD WIN NOW ANSWERED THE PERSUASION OF THE DEW
I SAW BY A LIGHT IN
THE ORATORY WINDOW THAT THE CATHOLIC HOUSEHOLD WERE THEN GATHERED TO
EVENING PRAYER A RITE FROM ATTENDANCE ON WHICH I NOW AND THEN AS A
PROTESTANT EXEMPTED MYSELF
ONE MOMENT LONGER WHISPERED SOLITUDE AND THE SUMMER MOON STAY WITH
US ALL IS TRULY QUIET NOW FOR ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR YOUR
PRESENCE WILL NOT BE MISSED THE DAY'S HEAT AND BUSTLE HAVE TIRED YOU
ENJOY THESE PRECIOUS MINUTES
THE WINDOWLESS BACKS OF HOUSES BUILT IN THIS GARDEN AND IN PARTICULAR
THE WHOLE OF ONE SIDE WAS SKIRTED BY THE REAR OF A LONG LINE OF
PREMISES BEING THE BOARDING HOUSES OF THE NEIGHBOURING COLLEGE
THIS
REAR HOWEVER WAS ALL BLANK STONE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN ATTIC
LOOPHOLES HIGH UP OPENING FROM THE SLEEPING ROOMS OF THE
WOMEN SERVANTS AND ALSO ONE CASEMENT IN A LOWER STORY SAID TO MARK THE
CHAMBER OR STUDY OF A MASTER
BUT THOUGH THUS SECURE AN ALLEY WHICH
RAN PARALLEL WITH THE VERY HIGH WALL ON THAT SIDE THE GARDEN WAS
FORBIDDEN TO BE ENTERED BY THE PUPILS
IT WAS CALLED INDEED L'ALLE
DFENDUE AND ANY GIRL SETTING FOOT THERE WOULD HAVE RENDERED HERSELF
LIABLE TO AS SEVERE A PENALTY AS THE MILD RULES OF MADAME BECK'S
ESTABLISHMENT PERMITTED
TEACHERS MIGHT INDEED GO THERE WITH IMPUNITY
BUT AS THE WALK WAS NARROW AND THE NEGLECTED SHRUBS WERE GROWN VERY
THICK AND CLOSE ON EACH SIDE WEAVING OVERHEAD A ROOF OF BRANCH AND
LEAF WHICH THE SUN'S RAYS PENETRATED BUT IN RARE CHEQUERS THIS ALLEY
WAS SELDOM ENTERED EVEN DURING DAY AND AFTER DUSK WAS CAREFULLY
SHUNNED
FROM THE FIRST I WAS TEMPTED TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE OF
AVOIDANCE THE SECLUSION THE VERY GLOOM OF THE WALK ATTRACTED ME
FOR
A LONG TIME THE FEAR OF SEEMING SINGULAR SCARED ME AWAY BUT BY
DEGREES AS PEOPLE BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO ME AND MY HABITS AND TO SUCH
SHADES OF PECULIARITY AS WERE ENGRAINED IN MY NATURE SHADES CERTAINLY
NOT STRIKING ENOUGH TO INTEREST AND PERHAPS NOT PROMINENT ENOUGH TO
OFFEND BUT BORN IN AND WITH ME AND NO MORE TO BE PARTED WITH THAN MY
IDENTITY BY SLOW DEGREES I BECAME A FREQUENTER OF THIS STRAIT AND
NARROW PATH
I MADE MYSELF GARDENER OF SOME TINTLESS FLOWERS THAT GREW
BETWEEN ITS CLOSELY RANKED SHRUBS I CLEARED AWAY THE RELICS OF PAST
AUTUMNS CHOKING UP A RUSTIC SEAT AT THE FAR END
BORROWING OF GOTON
THE CUISINIRE A PAIL OF WATER AND A SCRUBBING BRUSH I MADE THIS SEAT
CLEAN
MADAME SAW ME AT WORK AND SMILED APPROBATION WHETHER SINCERELY
OR NOT I DON'T KNOW BUT SHE SEEMED SINCERE
VOYEZ VOUS CRIED SHE COMME ELLE EST PROPRE CETTE DEMOISELLE
LUCIE VOUS AIMEZ DONE CETTE ALLE MEESS YES I SAID IT IS QUIET
AND SHADY
C'EST JUSTE CRIED SHE WITH AN AIR OF BONT AND SHE KINDLY
RECOMMENDED ME TO CONFINE MYSELF TO IT AS MUCH AS I CHOSE SAYING THAT
AS I WAS NOT CHARGED WITH THE SURVEILLANCE I NEED NOT TROUBLE MYSELF
TO WALK WITH THE PUPILS ONLY I MIGHT PERMIT HER CHILDREN TO COME
THERE TO TALK ENGLISH WITH ME
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION I WAS SITTING ON THE HIDDEN SEAT RECLAIMED
FROM FUNGI AND MOULD LISTENING TO WHAT SEEMED THE FAR OFF SOUNDS OF
THE CITY
FAR OFF IN TRUTH THEY WERE NOT THIS SCHOOL WAS IN THE
CITY'S CENTRE HENCE IT WAS BUT FIVE MINUTES' WALK TO THE PARK SCARCE
TEN TO BUILDINGS OF PALATIAL SPLENDOUR
QUITE NEAR WERE WIDE STREETS
BRIGHTLY LIT TEEMING AT THIS MOMENT WITH LIFE CARRIAGES WERE ROLLING
THROUGH THEM TO BALLS OR TO THE OPERA
THE SAME HOUR WHICH TOLLED
CURFEW FOR OUR CONVENT WHICH EXTINGUISHED EACH LAMP AND DROPPED THE
CURTAIN ROUND EACH COUCH RANG FOR THE GAY CITY ABOUT US THE SUMMONS TO
FESTAL ENJOYMENT
OF THIS CONTRAST I THOUGHT NOT HOWEVER GAY
INSTINCTS MY NATURE HAD FEW BALL OR OPERA I HAD NEVER SEEN AND THOUGH
OFTEN I HAD HEARD THEM DESCRIBED AND EVEN WISHED TO SEE THEM IT WAS
NOT THE WISH OF ONE WHO HOPES TO PARTAKE A PLEASURE IF SHE COULD ONLY
REACH IT WHO FEELS FITTED TO SHINE IN SOME BRIGHT DISTANT SPHERE
COULD SHE BUT THITHER WIN HER WAY IT WAS NO YEARNING TO ATTAIN NO
HUNGER TO TASTE ONLY THE CALM DESIRE TO LOOK ON A NEW THING
A MOON WAS IN THE SKY NOT A FULL MOON BUT A YOUNG CRESCENT
I SAW HER
THROUGH A SPACE IN THE BOUGHS OVERHEAD
SHE AND THE STARS VISIBLE
BESIDE HER WERE NO STRANGERS WHERE ALL ELSE WAS STRANGE MY CHILDHOOD
KNEW THEM
I HAD SEEN THAT GOLDEN SIGN WITH THE DARK GLOBE IN ITS CURVE
LEANING BACK ON AZURE BESIDE AN OLD THORN AT THE TOP OF AN OLD FIELD
IN OLD ENGLAND IN LONG PAST DAYS JUST AS IT NOW LEANED BACK BESIDE A
STATELY SPIRE IN THIS CONTINENTAL CAPITAL
OH MY CHILDHOOD I HAD FEELINGS PASSIVE AS I LIVED LITTLE AS I
SPOKE COLD AS I LOOKED WHEN I THOUGHT OF PAST DAYS I COULD FEEL
ABOUT THE PRESENT IT WAS BETTER TO BE STOICAL ABOUT THE FUTURE SUCH
A FUTURE AS MINE TO BE DEAD
AND IN CATALEPSY AND A DEAD TRANCE I
STUDIOUSLY HELD THE QUICK OF MY NATURE
AT THAT TIME I WELL REMEMBER WHATEVER COULD EXCITE CERTAIN ACCIDENTS
OF THE WEATHER FOR INSTANCE WERE ALMOST DREADED BY ME BECAUSE THEY
WOKE THE BEING I WAS ALWAYS LULLING AND STIRRED UP A CRAVING CRY I
COULD NOT SATISFY
ONE NIGHT A THUNDER STORM BROKE A SORT OF HURRICANE
SHOOK US IN OUR BEDS THE CATHOLICS ROSE IN PANIC AND PRAYED TO THEIR
SAINTS
AS FOR ME THE TEMPEST TOOK HOLD OF ME WITH TYRANNY I WAS
ROUGHLY ROUSED AND OBLIGED TO LIVE
I GOT UP AND DRESSED MYSELF AND
CREEPING OUTSIDE THE CASEMENT CLOSE BY MY BED SAT ON ITS LEDGE WITH
MY FEET ON THE ROOF OF A LOWER ADJOINING BUILDING
IT WAS WET IT WAS
WILD IT WAS PITCH DARK
WITHIN THE DORMITORY THEY GATHERED ROUND THE
NIGHT LAMP IN CONSTERNATION PRAYING LOUD
I COULD NOT GO IN TOO
RESISTLESS WAS THE DELIGHT OF STAYING WITH THE WILD HOUR BLACK AND
FULL OF THUNDER PEALING OUT SUCH AN ODE AS LANGUAGE NEVER DELIVERED TO
MAN TOO TERRIBLY GLORIOUS THE SPECTACLE OF CLOUDS SPLIT AND PIERCED
BY WHITE AND BLINDING BOLTS
I DID LONG ACHINGLY THEN AND FOR FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AFTERWARDS
FOR SOMETHING TO FETCH ME OUT OF MY PRESENT EXISTENCE AND LEAD ME
UPWARDS AND ONWARDS
THIS LONGING AND ALL OF A SIMILAR KIND IT WAS
NECESSARY TO KNOCK ON THE HEAD WHICH I DID FIGURATIVELY AFTER THE
MANNER OF JAEL TO SISERA DRIVING A NAIL THROUGH THEIR TEMPLES
UNLIKE
SISERA THEY DID NOT DIE THEY WERE BUT TRANSIENTLY STUNNED AND AT
INTERVALS WOULD TURN ON THE NAIL WITH A REBELLIOUS WRENCH THEN DID THE
TEMPLES BLEED AND THE BRAIN THRILL TO ITS CORE
TO NIGHT I WAS NOT SO MUTINOUS NOR SO MISERABLE
MY SISERA LAY QUIET
IN THE TENT SLUMBERING AND IF HIS PAIN ACHED THROUGH HIS SLUMBERS
SOMETHING LIKE AN ANGEL THE IDEAL KNELT NEAR DROPPING BALM ON THE
SOOTHED TEMPLES HOLDING BEFORE THE SEALED EYES A MAGIC GLASS OF WHICH
THE SWEET SOLEMN VISIONS WERE REPEATED IN DREAMS AND SHEDDING A
REFLEX FROM HER MOONLIGHT WINGS AND ROBE OVER THE TRANSFIXED SLEEPER
OVER THE TENT THRESHOLD OVER ALL THE LANDSCAPE LYING WITHOUT
JAEL
THE STERN WOMAN SAT APART RELENTING SOMEWHAT OVER HER CAPTIVE BUT
MORE PRONE TO DWELL ON THE FAITHFUL EXPECTATION OF HEBER COMING HOME
BY WHICH WORDS I MEAN THAT THE COOL PEACE AND DEWY SWEETNESS OF THE
NIGHT FILLED ME WITH A MOOD OF HOPE NOT HOPE ON ANY DEFINITE POINT
BUT A GENERAL SENSE OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND HEART EASE
SHOULD NOT SUCH A MOOD SO SWEET SO TRANQUIL SO UNWONTED HAVE BEEN
THE HARBINGER OF GOOD ALAS NO GOOD CAME OF IT I PRESENTLY THE RUDE
REAL BURST COARSELY IN ALL EVIL GROVELLING AND REPELLENT AS SHE TOO
OFTEN IS
AMID THE INTENSE STILLNESS OF THAT PILE OF STONE OVERLOOKING THE WALK
THE TREES THE HIGH WALL I HEARD A SOUND A CASEMENT ALL THE WINDOWS
HERE ARE CASEMENTS OPENING ON HINGES CREAKED
ERE I HAD TIME TO LOOK
UP AND MARK WHERE IN WHICH STORY OR BY WHOM UNCLOSED A TREE OVERHEAD
SHOOK AS IF STRUCK BY A MISSILE SOME OBJECT DROPPED PRONE AT MY FEET
NINE WAS STRIKING BY ST
JEAN BAPTISTE'S CLOCK DAY WAS FADING BUT IT
WAS NOT DARK THE CRESCENT MOON AIDED LITTLE BUT THE DEEP GILDING OF
THAT POINT IN HEAVEN WHERE THE SUN BEAMED LAST AND THE CRYSTALLINE
CLEARNESS OF A WIDE SPACE ABOVE SUSTAINED THE SUMMER TWILIGHT EVEN IN
MY DARK WALK I COULD BY APPROACHING AN OPENING HAVE MANAGED TO READ
PRINT OF A SMALL TYPE
EASY WAS IT TO SEE THEN THAT THE MISSILE WAS A
BOX A SMALL BOX OF WHITE AND COLOURED IVORY ITS LOOSE LID OPENED IN
MY HAND VIOLETS LAY WITHIN VIOLETS SMOTHERING A CLOSELY FOLDED BIT OF
PINK PAPER A NOTE SUPERSCRIBED POUR LA ROBE GRISE I WORE INDEED A
DRESS OF FRENCH GREY
GOOD
WAS THIS A BILLET DOUX A THING I HAD HEARD OF BUT HITHERTO HAD
NOT HAD THE HONOUR OF SEEING OR HANDLING
WAS IT THIS SORT OF COMMODITY
I HELD BETWEEN MY FINGER AND THUMB AT THIS MOMENT
SCARCELY I DID NOT DREAM IT FOR A MOMENT
SUITOR OR ADMIRER MY VERY
THOUGHTS HAD NOT CONCEIVED
ALL THE TEACHERS HAD DREAMS OF SOME LOVER
ONE BUT SHE WAS NATURALLY OF A CREDULOUS TURN BELIEVED IN A FUTURE
HUSBAND
ALL THE PUPILS ABOVE FOURTEEN KNEW OF SOME PROSPECTIVE
BRIDEGROOM TWO OR THREE WERE ALREADY AFFIANCED BY THEIR PARENTS AND
HAD BEEN SO FROM CHILDHOOD BUT INTO THE REALM OF FEELINGS AND HOPES
WHICH SUCH PROSPECTS OPEN MY SPECULATIONS FAR LESS MY PRESUMPTIONS
HAD NEVER ONCE HAD WARRANT TO INTRUDE
IF THE OTHER TEACHERS WENT INTO
TOWN OR TOOK A WALK ON THE BOULEVARDS OR ONLY ATTENDED MASS THEY
WERE VERY CERTAIN ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTS BROUGHT BACK TO MEET WITH
SOME INDIVIDUAL OF THE OPPOSITE SEX WHOSE RAPT EARNEST GAZE ASSURED
THEM OF THEIR POWER TO STRIKE AND TO ATTRACT
I CAN'T SAY THAT MY
EXPERIENCE TALLIED WITH THEIRS IN THIS RESPECT
I WENT TO CHURCH AND I
TOOK WALKS AND AM VERY WELL CONVINCED THAT NOBODY MINDED ME
THERE WAS
NOT A GIRL OR WOMAN IN THE RUE FOSSETTE WHO COULD NOT AND DID NOT
TESTIFY TO HAVING RECEIVED AN ADMIRING BEAM FROM OUR YOUNG DOCTOR'S
BLUE EYES AT ONE TIME OR OTHER
I AM OBLIGED HOWEVER HUMBLING IT MAY
SOUND TO EXCEPT MYSELF AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED THOSE BLUE EYES
WERE GUILTLESS AND CALM AS THE SKY TO WHOSE TINT THEIRS SEEMED AKIN
SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT I HEARD THE OTHERS TALK WONDERED OFTEN AT
THEIR GAIETY SECURITY AND SELF SATISFACTION BUT DID NOT TROUBLE
MYSELF TO LOOK UP AND GAZE ALONG THE PATH THEY SEEMED SO CERTAIN OF
TREADING
THIS THEN WAS NO BILLET DOUX AND IT WAS IN SETTLED
CONVICTION TO THE CONTRARY THAT I QUIETLY OPENED IT
THUS IT RAN I
TRANSLATE
ANGEL OF MY DREAMS A THOUSAND THOUSAND THANKS FOR THE PROMISE KEPT
SCARCELY DID I VENTURE TO HOPE ITS FULFILMENT
I BELIEVED YOU INDEED
TO BE HALF IN JEST AND THEN YOU SEEMED TO THINK THE ENTERPRISE BESET
WITH SUCH DANGER THE HOUR SO UNTIMELY THE ALLEY SO STRICTLY
SECLUDED OFTEN YOU SAID HAUNTED BY THAT DRAGON THE ENGLISH
TEACHER UNE VRITABLE BGUEULE BRITANNIQUE CE QUE VOUS DITES ESPCE
DE MONSTRE BRUSQUE ET RUDE COMME UN VIEUX CAPORAL DE GRENADIERS ET
REVCHE COMME UNE RELIGIEUSE THE READER WILL EXCUSE MY MODESTY IN
ALLOWING THIS FLATTERING SKETCH OF MY AMIABLE SELF TO RETAIN THE SLIGHT
VEIL OF THE ORIGINAL TONGUE
YOU ARE AWARE WENT ON THIS PRECIOUS
EFFUSION THAT LITTLE GUSTAVE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS ILLNESS HAS BEEN
REMOVED TO A MASTER'S CHAMBER THAT FAVOURED CHAMBER WHOSE LATTICE
OVERLOOKS YOUR PRISON GROUND
THERE I THE BEST UNCLE IN THE WORLD AM
ADMITTED TO VISIT HIM
HOW TREMBLINGLY I APPROACHED THE WINDOW AND
GLANCED INTO YOUR EDEN AN EDEN FOR ME THOUGH A DESERT FOR YOU HOW I
FEARED TO BEHOLD VACANCY OR THE DRAGON AFORESAID HOW MY HEART
PALPITATED WITH DELIGHT WHEN THROUGH APERTURES IN THE ENVIOUS BOUGHS
I AT ONCE CAUGHT THE GLEAM OF YOUR GRACEFUL STRAW HAT AND THE WAVING
OF YOUR GREY DRESS DRESS THAT I SHOULD RECOGNISE AMONGST A THOUSAND
BUT WHY MY ANGEL WILL YOU NOT LOOK UP CRUEL TO DENY ME ONE RAY OF
THOSE ADORABLE EYES HOW A SINGLE GLANCE WOULD HAVE REVIVED ME I
WRITE THIS IN FIERY HASTE WHILE THE PHYSICIAN EXAMINES GUSTAVE I
SNATCH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENCLOSE IT IN A SMALL CASKET TOGETHER WITH A
BOUQUET OF FLOWERS THE SWEETEST THAT BLOW YET LESS SWEET THAN THEE
MY PERI MY ALL CHARMING EVER THINE THOU WELL KNOWEST WHOM
I WISH I DID KNOW WHOM WAS MY COMMENT AND THE WISH BORE EVEN CLOSER
REFERENCE TO THE PERSON ADDRESSED IN THIS CHOICE DOCUMENT THAN TO THE
WRITER THEREOF
PERHAPS IT WAS FROM THE FIANC OF ONE OF THE ENGAGED
PUPILS AND IN THAT CASE THERE WAS NO GREAT HARM DONE OR
INTENDED ONLY A SMALL IRREGULARITY
SEVERAL OF THE GIRLS THE
MAJORITY INDEED HAD BROTHERS OR COUSINS AT THE NEIGHBOURING COLLEGE
BUT LA ROBE GRISE LE CHAPEAU DE PAILLE HERE SURELY WAS A CLUE A
VERY CONFUSING ONE
THE STRAW HAT WAS AN ORDINARY GARDEN HEAD SCREEN
COMMON TO A SCORE BESIDES MYSELF
THE GREY DRESS HARDLY GAVE MORE
DEFINITE INDICATION
MADAME BECK HERSELF ORDINARILY WORE A GREY DRESS
JUST NOW ANOTHER TEACHER AND THREE OF THE PENSIONNAIRES HAD HAD GREY
DRESSES PURCHASED OF THE SAME SHADE AND FABRIC AS MINE IT WAS A SORT
OF EVERY DAY WEAR WHICH HAPPENED AT THAT TIME TO BE IN VOGUE
MEANWHILE AS I PONDERED I KNEW I MUST GO IN
LIGHTS MOVING IN THE
DORMITORY ANNOUNCED THAT PRAYERS WERE OVER AND THE PUPILS GOING TO
BED
ANOTHER HALF HOUR AND ALL DOORS WOULD BE LOCKED ALL LIGHTS
EXTINGUISHED
THE FRONT DOOR YET STOOD OPEN TO ADMIT INTO THE HEATED
HOUSE THE COOLNESS OF THE SUMMER NIGHT FROM THE PORTRESS'S CABINET
CLOSE BY SHONE A LAMP SHOWING THE LONG VESTIBULE WITH THE TWO LEAVED
DRAWING ROOM DOORS ON ONE SIDE THE GREAT STREET DOOR CLOSING THE VISTA
ALL AT ONCE QUICK RANG THE BELL QUICK BUT NOT LOUD A CAUTIOUS
TINKLE A SORT OF WARNING METAL WHISPER
ROSINE DARTED FROM HER CABINET
AND RAN TO OPEN
THE PERSON SHE ADMITTED STOOD WITH HER TWO MINUTES IN
PARLEY THERE SEEMED A DEMUR A DELAY
ROSINE CAME TO THE GARDEN DOOR
LAMP IN HAND SHE STOOD ON THE STEPS LIFTING HER LAMP LOOKING ROUND
VAGUELY
QUEL CONTE SHE CRIED WITH A COQUETTISH LAUGH
PERSONNE N'Y A T
LET ME PASS PLEADED A VOICE I KNEW I ASK BUT FIVE MINUTES AND A
FAMILIAR SHAPE TALL AND GRAND AS WE OF THE RUE FOSSETTE ALL THOUGHT
IT ISSUED FROM THE HOUSE AND STRODE DOWN AMONGST THE BEDS AND WALKS
IT WAS SACRILEGE THE INTRUSION OF A MAN INTO THAT SPOT AT THAT HOUR
BUT HE KNEW HIMSELF PRIVILEGED AND PERHAPS HE TRUSTED TO THE FRIENDLY
NIGHT
HE WANDERED DOWN THE ALLEYS LOOKING ON THIS SIDE AND ON
THAT HE WAS LOST IN THE SHRUBS TRAMPLING FLOWERS AND BREAKING
BRANCHES IN HIS SEARCH HE PENETRATED AT LAST THE FORBIDDEN WALK
THERE I MET HIM LIKE SOME GHOST I SUPPOSE
DR
JOHN IT IS FOUND
HE DID NOT ASK BY WHOM FOR WITH HIS QUICK EYE HE PERCEIVED THAT I HELD
IT IN MY HAND
DO NOT BETRAY HER HE SAID LOOKING AT ME AS IF I WERE INDEED A
DRAGON
WERE I EVER SO DISPOSED TO TREACHERY I CANNOT BETRAY WHAT I DO NOT
KNOW WAS MY ANSWER
READ THE NOTE AND YOU WILL SEE HOW LITTLE IT
REVEALS
PERHAPS YOU HAVE READ IT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND YET I COULD NOT
BELIEVE HE WROTE IT THAT COULD HARDLY BE HIS STYLE BESIDES I WAS
FOOL ENOUGH TO THINK THERE WOULD BE A DEGREE OF HARDSHIP IN HIS CALLING
ME SUCH NAMES
HIS OWN LOOK VINDICATED HIM HE GREW HOT AND COLOURED
AS HE READ
THIS IS INDEED TOO MUCH THIS IS CRUEL THIS IS HUMILIATING WERE THE
WORDS THAT FELL FROM HIM
I THOUGHT IT WAS CRUEL WHEN I SAW HIS COUNTENANCE SO MOVED
NO
MATTER WHETHER HE WAS TO BLAME OR NOT SOMEBODY IT SEEMED TO ME MUST
BE MORE TO BLAME
WHAT SHALL YOU DO ABOUT IT HE INQUIRED OF ME
SHALL YOU TELL MADAME
BECK WHAT YOU HAVE FOUND AND CAUSE A STIR AN ESCLANDRE
I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL AND SAID SO ADDING THAT I DID NOT BELIEVE
THERE WOULD BE EITHER STIR OR ESCLANDRE MADAME WAS MUCH TOO PRUDENT TO
MAKE A NOISE ABOUT AN AFFAIR OF THAT SORT CONNECTED WITH HER
ESTABLISHMENT
HE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AND MEDITATING
HE WAS BOTH TOO PROUD AND TOO
HONOURABLE TO ENTREAT MY SECRESY ON A POINT WHICH DUTY EVIDENTLY
COMMANDED ME TO COMMUNICATE
I WISHED TO DO RIGHT YET LOATHED TO
GRIEVE OR INJURE HIM
JUST THEN ROSINE GLANCED OUT THROUGH THE OPEN
DOOR SHE COULD NOT SEE US THOUGH BETWEEN THE TREES I COULD PLAINLY
SEE HER HER DRESS WAS GREY LIKE MINE
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TAKEN IN
CONNECTION WITH PRIOR TRANSACTIONS SUGGESTED TO ME THAT PERHAPS THE
CASE HOWEVER DEPLORABLE WAS ONE IN WHICH I WAS UNDER NO OBLIGATION
WHATEVER TO CONCERN MYSELF
ACCORDINGLY I SAID IF YOU CAN ASSURE ME
THAT NONE OF MADAME BECK'S PUPILS ARE IMPLICATED IN THIS BUSINESS I
SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO STAND ALOOF FROM ALL INTERFERENCE
TAKE THE
CASKET THE BOUQUET AND THE BILLET FOR MY PART I GLADLY FORGET THE
WHOLE AFFAIR
LOOK THERE HE WHISPERED SUDDENLY AS HIS HAND CLOSED ON WHAT I
OFFERED AND AT THE SAME TIME HE POINTED THROUGH THE BOUGHS
I LOOKED
BEHOLD MADAME IN SHAWL WRAPPING GOWN AND SLIPPERS SOFTLY
DESCENDING THE STEPS AND STEALING LIKE A CAT ROUND THE GARDEN IN TWO
MINUTES SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN UPON DR
JOHN
IF SHE WERE LIKE A CAT
HOWEVER HE QUITE AS MUCH RESEMBLED A LEOPARD NOTHING COULD BE
LIGHTER THAN HIS TREAD WHEN HE CHOSE
HE WATCHED AND AS SHE TURNED A
CORNER HE TOOK THE GARDEN AT TWO NOISELESS BOUNDS
SHE REAPPEARED AND
HE WAS GONE
ROSINE HELPED HIM INSTANTLY INTERPOSING THE DOOR BETWEEN
HIM AND HIS HUNTRESS
I TOO MIGHT HAVE GOT AWAY BUT I PREFERRED TO
MEET MADAME OPENLY
THOUGH IT WAS MY FREQUENT AND WELL KNOWN CUSTOM TO SPEND TWILIGHT IN
THE GARDEN YET NEVER TILL NOW HAD I REMAINED SO LATE
FULL SURE WAS
I THAT MADAME HAD MISSED WAS COME IN SEARCH OF ME AND DESIGNED NOW TO
POUNCE ON THE DEFAULTER UNAWARES
I EXPECTED A REPRIMAND
NO
MADAME
WAS ALL GOODNESS
SHE TENDERED NOT EVEN A REMONSTRANCE SHE TESTIFIED
NO SHADE OF SURPRISE
WITH THAT CONSUMMATE TACT OF HERS IN WHICH I
BELIEVE SHE WAS NEVER SURPASSED BY LIVING THING SHE EVEN PROFESSED
MERELY TO HAVE ISSUED FORTH TO TASTE LA BRISE DU SOIR
QUELLE BELLE NUIT CRIED SHE LOOKING UP AT THE STARS THE MOON WAS
NOW GONE DOWN BEHIND THE BROAD TOWER OF JEAN BAPTISTE
QU'IL FAIT BON
QUE L'AIR EST FRAIS
AND INSTEAD OF SENDING ME IN SHE DETAINED ME TO TAKE A FEW TURNS WITH
HER DOWN THE PRINCIPAL ALLEY
WHEN AT LAST WE BOTH RE ENTERED SHE
LEANED AFFABLY ON MY SHOULDER BY WAY OF SUPPORT IN MOUNTING THE
FRONT DOOR STEPS AT PARTING HER CHEEK WAS PRESENTED TO MY LIPS AND
BON SOIR MY BONNE AMIE DORMEZ BIEN WAS HER KINDLY ADIEU FOR THE
NIGHT
I CAUGHT MYSELF SMILING AS I LAY AWAKE AND THOUGHTFUL ON MY
COUCH SMILING AT MADAME
THE UNCTION THE SUAVITY OF HER BEHAVIOUR
OFFERED FOR ONE WHO KNEW HER A SURE TOKEN THAT SUSPICION OF SOME KIND
WAS BUSY IN HER BRAIN
FROM SOME APERTURE OR SUMMIT OF OBSERVATION
THROUGH PARTED BOUGH OR OPEN WINDOW SHE HAD DOUBTLESS CAUGHT A
GLIMPSE REMOTE OR NEAR DECEPTIVE OR INSTRUCTIVE OF THAT NIGHT'S
TRANSACTIONS
FINELY ACCOMPLISHED AS SHE WAS IN THE ART OF
SURVEILLANCE IT WAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THAT A CASKET COULD BE THROWN
INTO HER GARDEN OR AN INTERLOPER COULD CROSS HER WALKS TO SEEK IT
WITHOUT THAT SHE IN SHAKEN BRANCH PASSING SHADE UNWONTED FOOTFALL
OR STILLY MURMUR AND THOUGH DR
JOHN HAD SPOKEN VERY LOW IN THE FEW
WORDS HE DROPPED ME YET THE HUM OF HIS MAN'S VOICE PERVADED I
THOUGHT THE WHOLE CONVENTUAL GROUND WITHOUT I SAY THAT SHE SHOULD
HAVE CAUGHT INTIMATION OF THINGS EXTRAORDINARY TRANSPIRING ON HER
PREMISES
WHAT THINGS SHE MIGHT BY NO MEANS SEE OR AT THAT TIME BE
ABLE TO DISCOVER BUT A DELICIOUS LITTLE RAVELLED PLOT LAY TEMPTING HER
TO DISENTANGLEMENT AND IN THE MIDST FOLDED ROUND AND ROUND IN
COBWEBS HAD SHE NOT SECURED MEESS LUCIE CLUMSILY INVOLVED LIKE THE
FOOLISH FLY SHE WAS
CHAPTER XIII
A SNEEZE OUT OF SEASON
I HAD OCCASION TO SMILE NAY TO LAUGH AT MADAME AGAIN WITHIN THE
SPACE OF FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AFTER THE LITTLE SCENE TREATED OF IN THE
LAST CHAPTER
VILLETTE OWNS A CLIMATE AS VARIABLE THOUGH NOT SO HUMID AS THAT OF
ANY ENGLISH TOWN
A NIGHT OF HIGH WIND FOLLOWED UPON THAT SOFT SUNSET
AND ALL THE NEXT DAY WAS ONE OF DRY STORM DARK BECLOUDED YET
RAINLESS THE STREETS WERE DIM WITH SAND AND DUST WHIRLED FROM THE
BOULEVARDS
I KNOW NOT THAT EVEN LOVELY WEATHER WOULD HAVE TEMPTED ME
TO SPEND THE EVENING TIME OF STUDY AND RECREATION WHERE I HAD SPENT IT
YESTERDAY
MY ALLEY AND INDEED ALL THE WALKS AND SHRUBS IN THE
GARDEN HAD ACQUIRED A NEW BUT NOT A PLEASANT INTEREST THEIR
SECLUSION WAS NOW BECOME PRECARIOUS THEIR CALM INSECURE
THAT
CASEMENT WHICH RAINED BILLETS HAD VULGARIZED THE ONCE DEAR NOOK IT
OVERLOOKED AND ELSEWHERE THE EYES OF THE FLOWERS HAD GAINED VISION
AND THE KNOTS IN THE TREE BOLES LISTENED LIKE SECRET EARS
SOME PLANTS
THERE WERE INDEED TRODDEN DOWN BY DR
JOHN IN HIS SEARCH AND HIS
HASTY AND HEEDLESS PROGRESS WHICH I WISHED TO PROP UP WATER AND
REVIVE SOME FOOTMARKS TOO HE HAD LEFT ON THE BEDS BUT THESE IN
SPITE OF THE STRONG WIND I FOUND A MOMENT'S LEISURE TO EFFACE VERY
EARLY IN THE MORNING ERE COMMON EYES HAD DISCOVERED THEM
WITH A
PENSIVE SORT OF CONTENT I SAT DOWN TO MY DESK AND MY GERMAN WHILE THE
PUPILS SETTLED TO THEIR EVENING LESSONS AND THE OTHER TEACHERS TOOK UP
THEIR NEEDLEWORK
THE SCENE OF THE ETUDE DU SOIR WAS ALWAYS THE REFECTORY A MUCH
SMALLER APARTMENT THAN ANY OF THE THREE CLASSES OR SCHOOLROOMS FOR
HERE NONE SAVE THE BOARDERS WERE EVER ADMITTED AND THESE NUMBERED
ONLY A SCORE
TWO LAMPS HUNG FROM THE CEILING OVER THE TWO TABLES
THESE WERE LIT AT DUSK AND THEIR KINDLING WAS THE SIGNAL FOR
SCHOOL BOOKS BEING SET ASIDE A GRAVE DEMEANOUR ASSUMED GENERAL
SILENCE ENFORCED AND THEN COMMENCED LA LECTURE PIEUSE THIS SAID
LECTURE PIEUSE WAS I SOON FOUND MAINLY DESIGNED AS A WHOLESOME
MORTIFICATION OF THE INTELLECT A USEFUL HUMILIATION OF THE REASON AND
SUCH A DOSE FOR COMMON SENSE AS SHE MIGHT DIGEST AT HER LEISURE AND
THRIVE ON AS SHE BEST COULD
THE BOOK BROUGHT OUT IT WAS NEVER CHANGED BUT WHEN FINISHED
RECOMMENCED WAS A VENERABLE VOLUME OLD AS THE HILLS GREY AS THE
HTEL DE VILLE
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN TWO FRANCS FOR THE CHANCE OF GETTING THAT BOOK ONCE
INTO MY BANDS TURNING OVER THE SACRED YELLOW LEAVES ASCERTAINING THE
TITLE AND PERUSING WITH MY OWN EYES THE ENORMOUS FIGMENTS WHICH AS AN
UNWORTHY HERETIC IT WAS ONLY PERMITTED ME TO DRINK IN WITH MY
BEWILDERED EARS
THIS BOOK CONTAINED LEGENDS OF THE SAINTS
GOOD GOD
I SPEAK THE WORDS REVERENTLY WHAT LEGENDS THEY WERE
WHAT GASCONADING
RASCALS THOSE SAINTS MUST HAVE BEEN IF THEY FIRST BOASTED THESE
EXPLOITS OR INVENTED THESE MIRACLES
THESE LEGENDS HOWEVER WERE NO
MORE THAN MONKISH EXTRAVAGANCES OVER WHICH ONE LAUGHED INWARDLY THERE
WERE BESIDES PRIESTLY MATTERS AND THE PRIESTCRAFT OF THE BOOK WAS
FAR WORSE THAN ITS MONKERY
THE EARS BURNED ON EACH SIDE OF MY HEAD AS
I LISTENED PERFORCE TO TALES OF MORAL MARTYRDOM INFLICTED BY ROME
THE DREAD BOASTS OF CONFESSORS WHO HAD WICKEDLY ABUSED THEIR OFFICE
TRAMPLING TO DEEP DEGRADATION HIGH BORN LADIES MAKING OF COUNTESSES
AND PRINCESSES THE MOST TORMENTED SLAVES UNDER THE SUN
STORIES LIKE
THAT OF CONRAD AND ELIZABETH OF HUNGARY RECURRED AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH
ALL ITS DREADFUL VICIOUSNESS SICKENING TYRANNY AND BLACK IMPIETY
TALES THAT WERE NIGHTMARES OF OPPRESSION PRIVATION AND AGONY
I SAT OUT THIS LECTURE PIEUSE FOR SOME NIGHTS AS WELL AS I COULD AND
AS QUIETLY TOO ONLY ONCE BREAKING OFF THE POINTS OF MY SCISSORS BY
INVOLUNTARILY STICKING THEM SOMEWHAT DEEP IN THE WORM EATEN BOARD OF
THE TABLE BEFORE ME
BUT AT LAST IT MADE ME SO BURNING HOT AND MY
TEMPLES AND MY HEART AND MY WRIST THROBBED SO FAST AND MY SLEEP
AFTERWARDS WAS SO BROKEN WITH EXCITEMENT THAT I COULD SIT NO LONGER
PRUDENCE RECOMMENDED HENCEFORWARD A SWIFT CLEARANCE OF MY PERSON FROM
THE PLACE THE MOMENT THAT GUILTY OLD BOOK WAS BROUGHT OUT
NO MAUSE
HEADRIGG EVER FELT A STRONGER CALL TO TAKE UP HER TESTIMONY AGAINST
SERGEANT BOTHWELL THAN I TO SPEAK MY MIND IN THIS MATTER OF THE
POPISH LECTURE PIEUSE HOWEVER I DID MANAGE SOMEHOW TO CURB AND REIN
IN AND THOUGH ALWAYS AS SOON AS ROSINE CAME TO LIGHT THE LAMPS I
SHOT FROM THE ROOM QUICKLY YET ALSO I DID IT QUIETLY SEIZING THAT
VANTAGE MOMENT GIVEN BY THE LITTLE BUSTLE BEFORE THE DEAD SILENCE AND
VANISHING WHILST THE BOARDERS PUT THEIR BOOKS AWAY
WHEN I VANISHED IT WAS INTO DARKNESS CANDLES WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE
CARRIED ABOUT AND THE TEACHER WHO FORSOOK THE REFECTORY HAD ONLY THE
UNLIT HALL SCHOOLROOM OR BEDROOM AS A REFUGE
IN WINTER I SOUGHT THE
LONG CLASSES AND PACED THEM FAST TO KEEP MYSELF WARM FORTUNATE IF THE
MOON SHONE AND IF THERE WERE ONLY STARS SOON RECONCILED TO THEIR DIM
GLEAM OR EVEN TO THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THEIR ABSENCE
IN SUMMER IT WAS
NEVER QUITE DARK AND THEN I WENT UP STAIRS TO MY OWN QUARTER OF THE
LONG DORMITORY OPENED MY OWN CASEMENT THAT CHAMBER WAS LIT BY FIVE
CASEMENTS LARGE AS GREAT DOORS AND LEANING OUT LOOKED FORTH UPON THE
CITY BEYOND THE GARDEN AND LISTENED TO BAND MUSIC FROM THE PARK OR THE
PALACE SQUARE THINKING MEANTIME MY OWN THOUGHTS LIVING MY OWN LIFE
IN MY OWN STILL SHADOW WORLD
THIS EVENING FUGITIVE AS USUAL BEFORE THE POPE AND HIS WORKS I
MOUNTED THE STAIRCASE APPROACHED THE DORMITORY AND QUIETLY OPENED THE
DOOR WHICH WAS ALWAYS KEPT CAREFULLY SHUT AND WHICH LIKE EVERY OTHER
DOOR IN THIS HOUSE REVOLVED NOISELESSLY ON WELL OILED HINGES
BEFORE I
SAW I FELT THAT LIFE WAS IN THE GREAT ROOM USUALLY VOID NOT THAT
THERE WAS EITHER STIR OR BREATH OR RUSTLE OF SOUND BUT VACUUM LACKED
SOLITUDE WAS NOT AT HOME
ALL THE WHITE BEDS THE LITS D'ANGE AS
THEY WERE POETICALLY TERMED LAY VISIBLE AT A GLANCE ALL WERE EMPTY
NO SLEEPER REPOSED THEREIN
THE SOUND OF A DRAWER CAUTIOUSLY SLID OUT
STRUCK MY EAR STEPPING A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE MY VISION TOOK A FREE
RANGE UNIMPEDED BY FALLING CURTAINS
I NOW COMMANDED MY OWN BED AND MY
OWN TOILET WITH A LOCKED WORK BOX UPON IT AND LOCKED DRAWERS
UNDERNEATH
VERY GOOD
A DUMPY MOTHERLY LITTLE BODY IN DECENT SHAWL AND THE
CLEANEST OF POSSIBLE NIGHTCAPS STOOD BEFORE THIS TOILET HARD AT WORK
APPARENTLY DOING ME THE KINDNESS OF TIDYING OUT THE MEUBLE OPEN
STOOD THE LID OF THE WORK BOX OPEN THE TOP DRAWER DULY AND
IMPARTIALLY WAS EACH SUCCEEDING DRAWER OPENED IN TURN NOT AN ARTICLE
OF THEIR CONTENTS BUT WAS LIFTED AND UNFOLDED NOT A PAPER BUT WAS
GLANCED OVER NOT A LITTLE BOX BUT WAS UNLIDDED AND BEAUTIFUL WAS THE
ADROITNESS EXEMPLARY THE CARE WITH WHICH THE SEARCH WAS ACCOMPLISHED
MADAME WROUGHT AT IT LIKE A TRUE STAR UNHASTING YET UNRESTING I
WILL NOT DENY THAT IT WAS WITH A SECRET GLEE I WATCHED HER
HAD I BEEN
A GENTLEMAN I BELIEVE MADAME WOULD HAVE FOUND FAVOUR IN MY EYES SHE
WAS SO HANDY NEAT THOROUGH IN ALL SHE DID SOME PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS
PROVOKE THE SOUL BY THEIR LOOSE AWKWARDNESS HERS SATISFIED BY THEIR
TRIM COMPACTNESS
I STOOD IN SHORT FASCINATED BUT IT WAS NECESSARY
TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO BREAK THIS SPELL A RETREAT MUST BE BEATEN
THE
SEARCHER MIGHT HAVE TURNED AND CAUGHT ME THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING
FOR IT THEN BUT A SCENE AND SHE AND I WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME ALL AT
ONCE WITH A SUDDEN CLASH TO A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER DOWN
WOULD HAVE GONE CONVENTIONALITIES AWAY SWEPT DISGUISES AND I SHOULD
HAVE LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND SHE INTO MINE WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT
WE COULD WORK TOGETHER NO MORE AND PARTED IN THIS LIFE FOR EVER
WHERE WAS THE USE OF TEMPTING SUCH A CATASTROPHE I WAS NOT ANGRY AND
HAD NO WISH IN THE WORLD TO LEAVE HER
I COULD HARDLY GET ANOTHER
EMPLOYER WHOSE YOKE WOULD BE SO LIGHT AND SO EASY OF CARRIAGE AND
TRULY I LIKED MADAME FOR HER CAPITAL SENSE WHATEVER I MIGHT THINK OF
HER PRINCIPLES AS TO HER SYSTEM IT DID ME NO HARM SHE MIGHT WORK ME
WITH IT TO HER HEART'S CONTENT NOTHING WOULD COME OF THE OPERATION
LOVERLESS AND INEXPECTANT OF LOVE I WAS AS SAFE FROM SPIES IN MY
HEART POVERTY AS THE BEGGAR FROM THIEVES IN HIS DESTITUTION OF PURSE
I TURNED THEN AND FLED DESCENDING THE STAIRS WITH PROGRESS AS SWIFT
AND SOUNDLESS AS THAT OF THE SPIDER WHICH AT THE SAME INSTANT RAN DOWN
THE BANNISTER
HOW I LAUGHED WHEN I REACHED THE SCHOOLROOM
I KNEW NOW SHE HAD
CERTAINLY SEEN DR
JOHN IN THE GARDEN I KNEW WHAT HER THOUGHTS WERE
THE SPECTACLE OF A SUSPICIOUS NATURE SO FAR MISLED BY ITS OWN
INVENTIONS TICKLED ME MUCH
YET AS THE LAUGH DIED A KIND OF WRATH
SMOTE ME AND THEN BITTERNESS FOLLOWED IT WAS THE ROCK STRUCK AND
MERIBAH'S WATERS GUSHING OUT
I NEVER HAD FELT SO STRANGE AND
CONTRADICTORY AN INWARD TUMULT AS I FELT FOR AN HOUR THAT EVENING
SORENESS AND LAUGHTER AND FIRE AND GRIEF SHARED MY HEART BETWEEN
THEM
I CRIED HOT TEARS NOT BECAUSE MADAME MISTRUSTED ME I DID NOT
CARE TWOPENCE FOR HER MISTRUST BUT FOR OTHER REASONS
COMPLICATED
DISQUIETING THOUGHTS BROKE UP THE WHOLE REPOSE OF MY NATURE
HOWEVER
THAT TURMOIL SUBSIDED NEXT DAY I WAS AGAIN LUCY SNOWE
ON REVISITING MY DRAWERS I FOUND THEM ALL SECURELY LOCKED THE CLOSEST
SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION COULD NOT DISCOVER CHANGE OR APPARENT
DISTURBANCE IN THE POSITION OF ONE OBJECT
MY FEW DRESSES WERE FOLDED
AS I HAD LEFT THEM A CERTAIN LITTLE BUNCH OF WHITE VIOLETS THAT HAD
ONCE BEEN SILENTLY PRESENTED TO ME BY A STRANGER A STRANGER TO ME FOR
WE HAD NEVER EXCHANGED WORDS AND WHICH I HAD DRIED AND KEPT FOR ITS
SWEET PERFUME BETWEEN THE FOLDS OF MY BEST DRESS LAY THERE UNSTIRRED
MY BLACK SILK SCARF MY LACE CHEMISETTE AND COLLARS WERE UNRUMPLED
HAD SHE CREASED ONE SOLITARY ARTICLE I OWN I SHOULD HAVE FELT MUCH
GREATER DIFFICULTY IN FORGIVING HER BUT FINDING ALL STRAIGHT AND
ORDERLY I SAID LET BYGONES BE BYGONES
I AM UNHARMED WHY SHOULD I
BEAR MALICE
A THING THERE WAS WHICH PUZZLED MYSELF AND I SOUGHT IN MY BRAIN A KEY
TO THAT RIDDLE ALMOST AS SEDULOUSLY AS MADAME HAD SOUGHT A GUIDE TO
USEFUL KNOWLEDGE IN MY TOILET DRAWERS
HOW WAS IT THAT DR
JOHN IF HE
HAD NOT BEEN ACCESSORY TO THE DROPPING OF THAT CASKET INTO THE GARDEN
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WAS DROPPED AND APPEARED SO PROMPTLY ON
THE SPOT TO SEEK IT SO STRONG WAS THE WISH TO CLEAR UP THIS POINT THAT
I BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN THIS DARING SUGGESTION WHY MAY I NOT IN CASE I
SHOULD EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY ASK DR
JOHN HIMSELF TO EXPLAIN THIS
COINCIDENCE
AND SO LONG AS DR
JOHN WAS ABSENT I REALLY BELIEVED I HAD COURAGE TO
TEST HIM WITH SUCH A QUESTION
LITTLE GEORGETTE WAS NOW CONVALESCENT AND HER PHYSICIAN ACCORDINGLY
MADE HIS VISITS VERY RARE INDEED HE WOULD HAVE CEASED THEM
ALTOGETHER HAD NOT MADAME INSISTED ON HIS GIVING AN OCCASIONAL CALL
TILL THE CHILD SHOULD BE QUITE WELL
SHE CAME INTO THE NURSERY ONE EVENING JUST AFTER I HAD LISTENED TO
GEORGETTE'S LISPED AND BROKEN PRAYER AND HAD PUT HER TO BED
TAKING
THE LITTLE ONE'S HAND SHE SAID CETTE ENFANT A TOUJOURS UN PEU DE
FIVRE AND PRESENTLY AFTERWARDS LOOKING AT ME WITH A QUICKER GLANCE
THAN WAS HABITUAL TO HER QUIET EYE LE DOCTEUR JOHN L'A T IL VUE
DERNIREMENT NON N'EST CE PAS
OF COURSE SHE KNEW THIS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE HOUSE
WELL SHE CONTINUED I AM GOING OUT POUR FAIRE QUELQUES COURSES EN
FIACRE
I SHALL CALL ON DR
JOHN AND SEND HIM TO THE CHILD
I WILL
THAT HE SEES HER THIS EVENING HER CHEEKS ARE FLUSHED HER PULSE IS
QUICK YOU WILL RECEIVE HIM FOR MY PART I SHALL BE FROM HOME
NOW THE CHILD WAS WELL ENOUGH ONLY WARM WITH THE WARMTH OF JULY IT
WAS SCARCELY LESS NEEDFUL TO SEND FOR A PRIEST TO ADMINISTER EXTREME
UNCTION THAN FOR A DOCTOR TO PRESCRIBE A DOSE ALSO MADAME RARELY MADE
COURSES AS SHE CALLED THEM IN THE EVENING MOREOVER THIS WAS THE
FIRST TIME SHE HAD CHOSEN TO ABSENT HERSELF ON THE OCCASION OF A VISIT
FROM DR
JOHN
THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT INDICATED SOME PLAN THIS I SAW
BUT WITHOUT THE LEAST ANXIETY
HA HA MADAME LAUGHED LIGHT HEART
THE BEGGAR YOUR CRAFTY WITS ARE ON THE WRONG TACK
SHE DEPARTED ATTIRED VERY SMARTLY IN A SHAWL OF PRICE AND A CERTAIN
CHAPEAU VERT TENDRE HAZARDOUS AS TO ITS TINT FOR ANY COMPLEXION
LESS FRESH THAN HER OWN BUT TO HER NOT UNBECOMING
I WONDERED WHAT
SHE INTENDED WHETHER SHE REALLY WOULD SEND DR
JOHN OR NOT OR WHETHER
INDEED HE WOULD COME HE MIGHT BE ENGAGED
MADAME HAD CHARGED ME NOT TO LET GEORGETTE SLEEP TILL THE DOCTOR CAME
I HAD THEREFORE SUFFICIENT OCCUPATION IN TELLING HER NURSERY TALES AND
PALAVERING THE LITTLE LANGUAGE FOR HER BENEFIT
I AFFECTED GEORGETTE
SHE WAS A SENSITIVE AND A LOVING CHILD TO HOLD HER IN MY LAP OR CARRY
HER IN MY ARMS WAS TO ME A TREAT
TO NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE ME LAY MY
HEAD ON THE PILLOW OF HER CRIB SHE EVEN PUT HER LITTLE ARMS ROUND MY
NECK
HER CLASP AND THE NESTLING ACTION WITH WHICH SHE PRESSED HER
CHEEK TO MINE MADE ME ALMOST CRY WITH A TENDER PAIN
FEELING OF NO
KIND ABOUNDED IN THAT HOUSE THIS PURE LITTLE DROP FROM A PURE LITTLE
SOURCE WAS TOO SWEET IT PENETRATED DEEP AND SUBDUED THE HEART AND
SENT A GUSH TO THE EYES
HALF AN HOUR OR AN HOUR PASSED GEORGETTE
MURMURED IN HER SOFT LISP THAT SHE WAS GROWING SLEEPY
AND YOU SHALL
SLEEP THOUGHT I MALGR MAMAN AND MDECIN IF THEY ARE NOT HERE IN
TEN MINUTES
HARK THERE WAS THE RING AND THERE THE TREAD ASTONISHING THE
STAIRCASE BY THE FLEETNESS WITH WHICH IT LEFT THE STEPS BEHIND
ROSINE
INTRODUCED DR
JOHN AND WITH A FREEDOM OF MANNER NOT ALTOGETHER
PECULIAR TO HERSELF BUT CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOMESTICS OF VILLETTE
GENERALLY SHE STAYED TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
MADAME'S PRESENCE
WOULD HAVE AWED HER BACK TO HER OWN REALM OF THE VESTIBULE AND THE
CABINET FOR MINE OR THAT OF ANY OTHER TEACHER OR PUPIL SHE CARED NOT
A JOT
SMART TRIM AND PERT SHE STOOD A HAND IN EACH POCKET OF HER
GAY GRISETTE APRON EYEING DR
JOHN WITH NO MORE FEAR OR SHYNESS THAN
IF HE HAD BEEN A PICTURE INSTEAD OF A LIVING GENTLEMAN
LE MARMOT N'A RIEN NEST CE PAS SAID SHE INDICATING GEORGETTE WITH
A JERK OF HER CHIN
PAS BEAUCOUP WAS THE ANSWER AS THE DOCTOR HASTILY SCRIBBLED WITH
HIS PENCIL SOME HARMLESS PRESCRIPTION
EH BIEN PURSUED ROSINE APPROACHING HIM QUITE NEAR WHILE HE PUT UP
HIS PENCIL
AND THE BOX DID YOU GET IT MONSIEUR WENT OFF LIKE A
COUP DE VENT THE OTHER NIGHT I HAD NOT TIME TO ASK HIM
I FOUND IT YES
AND WHO THREW IT THEN CONTINUED ROSINE SPEAKING QUITE FREELY THE
VERY WORDS I SHOULD SO MUCH HAVE WISHED TO SAY BUT HAD NO ADDRESS OR
COURAGE TO BRING IT OUT HOW SHORT SOME PEOPLE MAKE THE ROAD TO A POINT
WHICH FOR OTHERS SEEMS UNATTAINABLE
THAT MAY BE MY SECRET REJOINED DR
JOHN BRIEFLY BUT WITH NO SORT
OF HAUTEUR HE SEEMED QUITE TO UNDERSTAND THE ROSINE OR GRISETTE
CHARACTER
MAIS ENFIN CONTINUED SHE NOTHING ABASHED MONSIEUR KNEW IT WAS
THROWN SINCE HE CAME TO SEEK IT HOW DID HE KNOW
I WAS ATTENDING A LITTLE PATIENT IN THE COLLEGE NEAR SAID HE AND
SAW IT DROPPED OUT OF HIS CHAMBER WINDOW AND SO CAME TO PICK IT UP
HOW SIMPLE THE WHOLE EXPLANATION THE NOTE HAD ALLUDED TO A PHYSICIAN
AS THEN EXAMINING GUSTAVE
AH A PURSUED ROSINE IL N'Y A DONC RIEN L DESSOUS PAS DE
MYSTRE PAS D'AMOURETTE PAR EXEMPLE
PAS PLUS QUE SUR MA MAIN RESPONDED THE DOCTOR SHOWING HIS PALM
QUEL DOMMAGE RESPONDED THE GRISETTE ET MOI QUI TOUT CELA
COMMENAIT DONNER DES IDES
VRAIMENT VOUS EN TES POUR VOS FRAIS WAS THE DOCTOR'S COOL
REJOINDER
SHE POUTED
THE DOCTOR COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE SORT OF MOUE
SHE MADE WHEN HE LAUGHED HE HAD SOMETHING PECULIARLY GOOD NATURED AND
GENIAL IN HIS LOOK
I SAW HIS HAND INCLINE TO HIS POCKET
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU OPENED THE DOOR FOR ME WITHIN THIS LAST
MONTH HE ASKED
MONSIEUR OUGHT TO HAVE KEPT COUNT OF THAT SAID ROSINE QUITE READILY
AS IF I HAD NOT SOMETHING BETTER TO DO REJOINED HE BUT I SAW HIM
GIVE HER A PIECE OF GOLD WHICH SHE TOOK UNSCRUPULOUSLY AND THEN
DANCED OFF TO ANSWER THE DOOR BELL RINGING JUST NOW EVERY FIVE
MINUTES AS THE VARIOUS SERVANTS CAME TO FETCH THE HALF BOARDERS
THE READER MUST NOT THINK TOO HARDLY OF ROSINE ON THE WHOLE SHE WAS
NOT A BAD SORT OF PERSON AND HAD NO IDEA THERE COULD BE ANY DISGRACE
IN GRASPING AT WHATEVER SHE COULD GET OR ANY EFFRONTERY IN CHATTERING
LIKE A PIE TO THE BEST GENTLEMAN IN CHRISTENDOM
I HAD LEARNT SOMETHING FROM THE ABOVE SCENE BESIDES WHAT CONCERNED THE
IVORY BOX VIZ THAT NOT ON THE ROBE DE JACONAS PINK OR GREY NOR YET
ON THE FRILLED AND POCKETED APRON LAY THE BLAME OF BREAKING DR
JOHN'S
HEART THESE ITEMS OF ARRAY WERE OBVIOUSLY GUILTLESS AS GEORGETTE'S
LITTLE BLUE TUNIC
SO MUCH THE BETTER
BUT WHO THEN WAS THE CULPRIT
WHAT WAS THE GROUND WHAT THE ORIGIN WHAT THE PERFECT EXPLANATION OF
THE WHOLE BUSINESS SOME POINTS HAD BEEN CLEARED BUT HOW MANY YET
REMAINED OBSCURE AS NIGHT
HOWEVER I SAID TO MYSELF IT IS NO AFFAIR OF YOURS AND TURNING
FROM THE FACE ON WHICH I HAD BEEN UNCONSCIOUSLY DWELLING WITH A
QUESTIONING GAZE I LOOKED THROUGH THE WINDOW WHICH COMMANDED THE
GARDEN BELOW
DR
JOHN MEANTIME STANDING BY THE BED SIDE WAS SLOWLY
DRAWING ON HIS GLOVES AND WATCHING HIS LITTLE PATIENT AS HER EYES
CLOSED AND HER ROSY LIPS PARTED IN COMING SLEEP
I WAITED TILL HE
SHOULD DEPART AS USUAL WITH A QUICK BOW AND SCARCE ARTICULATE
GOOD NIGHT
JUST AS HE TOOK HIS HAT MY EYES FIXED ON THE TALL
HOUSES BOUNDING THE GARDEN SAW THE ONE LATTICE ALREADY COMMEMORATED
CAUTIOUSLY OPEN FORTH FROM THE APERTURE PROJECTED A HAND AND A WHITE
HANDKERCHIEF BOTH WAVED
I KNOW NOT WHETHER THE SIGNAL WAS ANSWERED
FROM SOME VIEWLESS QUARTER OF OUR OWN DWELLING BUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER
THERE FLUTTERED FROM THE LATTICE A FALLING OBJECT WHITE AND
LIGHT BILLET THE SECOND OF COURSE
THERE I EJACULATED INVOLUNTARILY
WHERE ASKED DR
JOHN WITH ENERGY MAKING DIRECT FOR THE WINDOW
WHAT IS IT
THEY HAVE GONE AND DONE IT AGAIN WAS MY REPLY
A HANDKERCHIEF WAVED
AND SOMETHING FELL AND I POINTED TO THE LATTICE NOW CLOSED AND
LOOKING HYPOCRITICALLY BLANK
GO AT ONCE PICK IT UP AND BRING IT HERE WAS HIS PROMPT DIRECTION
ADDING NOBODY WILL TAKE NOTICE OF YOU I SHOULD BE SEEN
STRAIGHT I WENT
AFTER SOME LITTLE SEARCH I FOUND A FOLDED PAPER
LODGED ON THE LOWER BRANCH OF A SHRUB I SEIZED AND BROUGHT IT DIRECT
TO DR
JOHN
THIS TIME I BELIEVE NOT EVEN ROSINE SAW ME
HE INSTANTLY TORE THE BILLET INTO SMALL PIECES WITHOUT READING IT
IT
IS NOT IN THE LEAST HER FAULT YOU MUST REMEMBER HE SAID LOOKING
AT ME
WHOSE FAULT I ASKED
WHO IS IT
YOU DON'T YET KNOW THEN
NOT IN THE LEAST
HAVE YOU NO GUESS
NONE
IF I KNEW YOU BETTER I MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO RISK SOME CONFIDENCE AND
THUS SECURE YOU AS GUARDIAN OVER A MOST INNOCENT AND EXCELLENT BUT
SOMEWHAT INEXPERIENCED BEING
AS A DUENNA I ASKED
YES SAID HE ABSTRACTEDLY
WHAT SNARES ARE ROUND HER HE ADDED
MUSINGLY AND NOW CERTAINLY FOR THE FIRST TIME HE EXAMINED MY FACE
ANXIOUS DOUBTLESS TO SEE IF ANY KINDLY EXPRESSION THERE WOULD
WARRANT HIM IN RECOMMENDING TO MY CARE AND INDULGENCE SOME ETHEREAL
CREATURE AGAINST WHOM POWERS OF DARKNESS WERE PLOTTING
I FELT NO
PARTICULAR VOCATION TO UNDERTAKE THE SURVEILLANCE OF ETHEREAL
CREATURES BUT RECALLING THE SCENE AT THE BUREAU IT SEEMED TO ME THAT
I OWED HIM A GOOD TURN IF I COULD HELP HIM THEN I WOULD AND IT
LAY NOT WITH ME TO DECIDE HOW
WITH AS LITTLE RELUCTANCE AS MIGHT BE I
INTIMATED THAT I WAS WILLING TO DO WHAT I COULD TOWARDS TAKING CARE OF
ANY PERSON IN WHOM HE MIGHT BE INTERESTED
I AM NO FARTHER INTERESTED THAN AS A SPECTATOR SAID HE WITH A
MODESTY ADMIRABLE AS I THOUGHT TO WITNESS
I HAPPEN TO BE
ACQUAINTED WITH THE RATHER WORTHLESS CHARACTER OF THE PERSON WHO FROM
THE HOUSE OPPOSITE HAS NOW TWICE INVADED THE SANCTITY OF THIS PLACE I
HAVE ALSO MET IN SOCIETY THE OBJECT AT WHOM THESE VULGAR ATTEMPTS ARE
AIMED
HER EXQUISITE SUPERIORITY AND INNATE REFINEMENT OUGHT ONE WOULD
THINK TO SCARE IMPERTINENCE FROM HER VERY IDEA
IT IS NOT SO HOWEVER
AND INNOCENT UNSUSPICIOUS AS SHE IS I WOULD GUARD HER FROM EVIL IF I
COULD
IN PERSON HOWEVER I CAN DO NOTHING I CANNOT COME NEAR HER HE
PAUSED
WELL I AM WILLING TO HELP YOU SAID I ONLY TELL ME HOW AND
BUSILY IN MY OWN MIND I RAN OVER THE LIST OF OUR INMATES SEEKING
THIS PARAGON THIS PEARL OF GREAT PRICE THIS GEM WITHOUT FLAW
IT
MUST BE MADAME I CONCLUDED
SHE ONLY AMONGST US ALL HAS THE ART
EVEN TO SEEM SUPERIOR BUT AS TO BEING UNSUSPICIOUS INEXPERIENCED
C DR
JOHN NEED NOT DISTRACT HIMSELF ABOUT THAT
HOWEVER THIS IS
JUST HIS WHIM AND I WILL NOT CONTRADICT HIM HE SHALL BE HUMOURED HIS
ANGEL SHALL BE AN ANGEL
JUST NOTIFY THE QUARTER TO WHICH MY CARE IS TO BE DIRECTED I
CONTINUED GRAVELY CHUCKLING HOWEVER TO MYSELF OVER THE THOUGHT OF
BEING SET TO CHAPERON MADAME BECK OR ANY OF HER PUPILS
NOW DR
JOHN
HAD A FINE SET OF NERVES AND HE AT ONCE FELT BY INSTINCT WHAT NO MORE
COARSELY CONSTITUTED MIND WOULD HAVE DETECTED NAMELY THAT I WAS A
LITTLE AMUSED AT HIM
THE COLOUR ROSE TO HIS CHEEK WITH HALF A SMILE
HE TURNED AND TOOK HIS HAT HE WAS GOING
MY HEART SMOTE ME
I WILL I WILL HELP YOU SAID I EAGERLY
I WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH
I
WILL WATCH OVER YOUR ANGEL I WILL TAKE CARE OF HER ONLY TELL ME WHO
SHE IS
BUT YOU MUST KNOW SAID HE THEN WITH EARNESTNESS YET SPEAKING VERY
LOW
SO SPOTLESS SO GOOD SO UNSPEAKABLY BEAUTIFUL IMPOSSIBLE THAT
ONE HOUSE SHOULD CONTAIN TWO LIKE HER
I ALLUDE OF COURSE
HERE THE LATCH OF MADAME BECK'S CHAMBER DOOR OPENING INTO THE NURSERY
GAVE A SUDDEN CLICK AS IF THE HAND HOLDING IT HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY
CONVULSED THERE WAS THE SUPPRESSED EXPLOSION OF AN IRREPRESSIBLE
SNEEZE
THESE LITTLE ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN TO THE BEST OF US
MADAME EXCELLENT WOMAN WAS THEN ON DUTY
SHE HAD COME HOME QUIETLY
STOLEN UP STAIRS ON TIP TOE SHE WAS IN HER CHAMBER
IF SHE HAD NOT
SNEEZED SHE WOULD HAVE HEARD ALL AND SO SHOULD I BUT THAT UNLUCKY
STERNUTATION ROUTED DR
JOHN
WHILE HE STOOD AGHAST SHE CAME FORWARD
ALERT COMPOSED IN THE BEST YET MOST TRANQUIL SPIRITS NO NOVICE TO
HER HABITS BUT WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE HAD JUST COME IN AND SCOUTED THE
IDEA OF HER EAR HAVING BEEN GLUED TO THE KEY HOLE FOR AT LEAST TEN
MINUTES
SHE AFFECTED TO SNEEZE AGAIN DECLARED SHE WAS ENRHUME AND
THEN PROCEEDED VOLUBLY TO RECOUNT HER COURSES EN FIACRE THE
PRAYER BELL RANG AND I LEFT HER WITH THE DOCTOR
CHAPTER XIV
THE FTE
AS SOON AS GEORGETTE WAS WELL MADAME SENT HER AWAY INTO THE COUNTRY
I
WAS SORRY I LOVED THE CHILD AND HER LOSS MADE ME POORER THAN BEFORE
BUT I MUST NOT COMPLAIN
I LIVED IN A HOUSE FULL OF ROBUST LIFE I
MIGHT HAVE HAD COMPANIONS AND I CHOSE SOLITUDE
EACH OF THE TEACHERS
IN TURN MADE ME OVERTURES OF SPECIAL INTIMACY I TRIED THEM ALL
ONE I
FOUND TO BE AN HONEST WOMAN BUT A NARROW THINKER A COARSE FEELER AND
AN EGOTIST
THE SECOND WAS A PARISIENNE EXTERNALLY REFINED AT HEART
CORRUPT WITHOUT A CREED WITHOUT A PRINCIPLE WITHOUT AN AFFECTION
HAVING PENETRATED THE OUTWARD CRUST OF DECORUM IN THIS CHARACTER YOU
FOUND A SLOUGH BENEATH
SHE HAD A WONDERFUL PASSION FOR PRESENTS AND
IN THIS POINT THE THIRD TEACHER A PERSON OTHERWISE CHARACTERLESS AND
INSIGNIFICANT CLOSELY RESEMBLED HER
THIS LAST NAMED HAD ALSO ONE
OTHER DISTINCTIVE PROPERTY THAT OF AVARICE
IN HER REIGNED THE LOVE OF
MONEY FOR ITS OWN SAKE
THE SIGHT OF A PIECE OF GOLD WOULD BRING INTO
HER EYES A GREEN GLISTEN SINGULAR TO WITNESS
SHE ONCE AS A MARK OF
HIGH FAVOUR TOOK ME UP STAIRS AND OPENING A SECRET DOOR SHOWED ME A
HOARD A MASS OF COARSE LARGE COIN ABOUT FIFTEEN GUINEAS IN
FIVE FRANC PIECES
SHE LOVED THIS HOARD AS A BIRD LOVES ITS EGGS
THESE
WERE HER SAVINGS
SHE WOULD COME AND TALK TO ME ABOUT THEM WITH AN
INFATUATED AND PERSEVERING DOTAGE STRANGE TO BEHOLD IN A PERSON NOT
YET TWENTY FIVE
THE PARISIENNE ON THE OTHER HAND WAS PRODIGAL AND PROFLIGATE IN
DISPOSITION THAT IS AS TO ACTION I DO NOT KNOW
THAT LATTER QUALITY
SHOWED ITS SNAKE HEAD TO ME BUT ONCE PEEPING OUT VERY CAUTIOUSLY
A
CURIOUS KIND OF REPTILE IT SEEMED JUDGING FROM THE GLIMPSE I GOT ITS
NOVELTY WHETTED MY CURIOSITY IF IT WOULD HAVE COME OUT BOLDLY PERHAPS
I MIGHT PHILOSOPHICALLY HAVE STOOD MY GROUND AND COOLLY SURVEYED THE
LONG THING FROM FORKED TONGUE TO SCALY TAIL TIP BUT IT MERELY RUSTLED
IN THE LEAVES OF A BAD NOVEL AND ON ENCOUNTERING A HASTY AND
ILL ADVISED DEMONSTRATION OF WRATH RECOILED AND VANISHED HISSING
SHE
HATED ME FROM THAT DAY
THIS PARISIENNE WAS ALWAYS IN DEBT HER SALARY BEING ANTICIPATED NOT
ONLY IN DRESS BUT IN PERFUMES COSMETICS CONFECTIONERY AND
CONDIMENTS
WHAT A COLD CALLOUS EPICURE SHE WAS IN ALL THINGS I SEE
HER NOW
THIN IN FACE AND FIGURE SALLOW IN COMPLEXION REGULAR IN
FEATURES WITH PERFECT TEETH LIPS LIKE A THREAD A LARGE PROMINENT
CHIN A WELL OPENED BUT FROZEN EYE OF LIGHT AT ONCE CRAVING AND
INGRATE
SHE MORTALLY HATED WORK AND LOVED WHAT SHE CALLED PLEASURE
BEING AN INSIPID HEARTLESS BRAINLESS DISSIPATION OF TIME
MADAME BECK KNEW THIS WOMAN'S CHARACTER PERFECTLY WELL
SHE ONCE TALKED
TO ME ABOUT HER WITH AN ODD MIXTURE OF DISCRIMINATION INDIFFERENCE
AND ANTIPATHY
I ASKED WHY SHE KEPT HER IN THE ESTABLISHMENT
SHE
ANSWERED PLAINLY BECAUSE IT SUITED HER INTEREST TO DO SO AND
POINTED OUT A FACT I HAD ALREADY NOTICED NAMELY THAT MADEMOISELLE ST
PIERRE POSSESSED IN AN ALMOST UNIQUE DEGREE THE POWER OF KEEPING
ORDER AMONGST HER UNDISCIPLINED RANKS OF SCHOLARS
A CERTAIN PETRIFYING
INFLUENCE ACCOMPANIED AND SURROUNDED HER WITHOUT PASSION NOISE OR
VIOLENCE SHE HELD THEM IN CHECK AS A BREEZELESS FROST AIR MIGHT STILL
A BRAWLING STREAM
SHE WAS OF LITTLE USE AS FAR AS COMMUNICATION OF
KNOWLEDGE WENT BUT FOR STRICT SURVEILLANCE AND MAINTENANCE OF RULES
SHE WAS INVALUABLE
JE SAIS BIEN QU'ELLE N'A PAS DE PRINCIPES NI
PEUT TRE DE MOEURS ADMITTED MADAME FRANKLY BUT ADDED WITH
PHILOSOPHY SON MAINTIEN EN CLASSE EST TOUJOURS CONVENABLE ET REMPLI
MME D'UNE CERTAINE DIGNIT C'EST TOUT CE QU'IL FAUT
NI LES LVES NI
LES PARENTS NE REGARDENT PLUS LOIN NI PAR CONSQUENT MOI NON PLUS
A STRANGE FROLICSOME NOISY LITTLE WORLD WAS THIS SCHOOL GREAT PAINS
WERE TAKEN TO HIDE CHAINS WITH FLOWERS A SUBTLE ESSENCE OF ROMANISM
PERVADED EVERY ARRANGEMENT LARGE SENSUAL INDULGENCE SO TO SPEAK WAS
PERMITTED BY WAY OF COUNTERPOISE TO JEALOUS SPIRITUAL RESTRAINT
EACH
MIND WAS BEING REARED IN SLAVERY BUT TO PREVENT REFLECTION FROM
DWELLING ON THIS FACT EVERY PRETEXT FOR PHYSICAL RECREATION WAS SEIZED
AND MADE THE MOST OF
THERE AS ELSEWHERE THE CHURCH STROVE TO BRING
UP HER CHILDREN ROBUST IN BODY FEEBLE IN SOUL FAT RUDDY HALE
JOYOUS IGNORANT UNTHINKING UNQUESTIONING
EAT DRINK AND LIVE
SHE SAYS
LOOK AFTER YOUR BODIES LEAVE YOUR SOULS TO ME
I HOLD THEIR
CURE GUIDE THEIR COURSE I GUARANTEE THEIR FINAL FATE A BARGAIN IN
WHICH EVERY TRUE CATHOLIC DEEMS HIMSELF A GAINER
LUCIFER JUST OFFERS
THE SAME TERMS ALL THIS POWER WILL I GIVE THEE AND THE GLORY OF IT
FOR THAT IS DELIVERED UNTO ME AND TO WHOMSOEVER I WILL I GIVE IT
IF
THOU THEREFORE WILT WORSHIP ME ALL SHALL BE THINE
ABOUT THIS TIME IN THE RIPEST GLOW OF SUMMER MADAME BECK'S HOUSE
BECAME AS MERRY A PLACE AS A SCHOOL COULD WELL BE
ALL DAY LONG THE
BROAD FOLDING DOORS AND THE TWO LEAVED CASEMENTS STOOD WIDE OPEN
SETTLED SUNSHINE SEEMED NATURALIZED IN THE ATMOSPHERE CLOUDS WERE FAR
OFF SAILING AWAY BEYOND SEA RESTING NO DOUBT ROUND ISLANDS SUCH AS
ENGLAND THAT DEAR LAND OF MISTS BUT WITHDRAWN WHOLLY FROM THE DRIER
CONTINENT
WE LIVED FAR MORE IN THE GARDEN THAN UNDER A ROOF CLASSES
WERE HELD AND MEALS PARTAKEN OF IN THE GRAND BERCEAU MOREOVER
THERE WAS A NOTE OF HOLIDAY PREPARATION WHICH ALMOST TURNED FREEDOM
INTO LICENCE
THE AUTUMNAL LONG VACATION WAS BUT TWO MONTHS DISTANT
BUT BEFORE THAT A GREAT DAY AN IMPORTANT CEREMONY NONE OTHER THAN
THE FTE OF MADAME AWAITED CELEBRATION
THE CONDUCT OF THIS FTE DEVOLVED CHIEFLY ON MADEMOISELLE ST
PIERRE
MADAME HERSELF BEING SUPPOSED TO STAND ALOOF DISINTERESTEDLY
UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT MIGHT BE GOING FORWARD IN HER HONOUR
ESPECIALLY
SHE NEVER KNEW NEVER IN THE LEAST SUSPECTED THAT A SUBSCRIPTION WAS
ANNUALLY LEVIED ON THE WHOLE SCHOOL FOR THE PURCHASE OF A HANDSOME
PRESENT
THE POLITE TACT OF THE READER WILL PLEASE TO LEAVE OUT OF THE
ACCOUNT A BRIEF SECRET CONSULTATION ON THIS POINT IN MADAME'S OWN
CHAMBER
WHAT WILL YOU HAVE THIS YEAR WAS ASKED BY HER PARISIAN LIEUTENANT
OH NO MATTER LET IT ALONE
LET THE POOR CHILDREN KEEP THEIR FRANCS
AND MADAME LOOKED BENIGN AND MODEST
THE ST
PIERRE WOULD HERE PROTRUDE HER CHIN SHE KNEW MADAME BY HEART
SHE ALWAYS CALLED HER AIRS OF BONT DES GRIMACES SHE NEVER EVEN
PROFESSED TO RESPECT THEM ONE INSTANT
VITE SHE WOULD SAY COLDLY
NAME THE ARTICLE
SHALL IT BE JEWELLERY
OR PORCELAIN HABERDASHERY OR SILVER
EH BIEN DEUX OU TROIS CUILLERS ET AUTANT DE FOURCHETTES EN ARGENT
AND THE RESULT WAS A HANDSOME CASE CONTAINING 300 FRANCS WORTH OF
PLATE
THE PROGRAMME OF THE FTE DAY'S PROCEEDINGS COMPRISED PRESENTATION OF
PLATE COLLATION IN THE GARDEN DRAMATIC PERFORMANCE WITH PUPILS AND
TEACHERS FOR ACTORS A DANCE AND SUPPER
VERY GORGEOUS SEEMED THE
EFFECT OF THE WHOLE TO ME AS I WELL REMEMBER
ZLIE ST
PIERRE
UNDERSTOOD THESE THINGS AND MANAGED THEM ABLY
THE PLAY WAS THE MAIN POINT A MONTH'S PREVIOUS DRILLING BEING THERE
REQUIRED
THE CHOICE TOO OF THE ACTORS REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE AND CARE
THEN CAME LESSONS IN ELOCUTION IN ATTITUDE AND THEN THE FATIGUE OF
COUNTLESS REHEARSALS
FOR ALL THIS AS MAY WELL BE SUPPOSED ST
PIERRE
DID NOT SUFFICE OTHER MANAGEMENT OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAN HERS WERE
REQUISITE HERE
THEY WERE SUPPLIED IN THE PERSON OF A MASTER M
PAUL
EMANUEL PROFESSOR OF LITERATURE
IT WAS NEVER MY LOT TO BE PRESENT AT
THE HISTRIONIC LESSONS OF M
PAUL BUT I OFTEN SAW HIM AS HE CROSSED
THE CARR A SQUARE HALL BETWEEN THE DWELLING HOUSE AND
SCHOOL HOUSE
I HEARD HIM TOO IN THE WARM EVENINGS LECTURING WITH
OPEN DOORS AND HIS NAME WITH ANECDOTES OF HIM RESOUNDED IN ONES EARS
FROM ALL SIDES
ESPECIALLY OUR FORMER ACQUAINTANCE MISS GINEVRA
FANSHAWE WHO HAD BEEN SELECTED TO TAKE A PROMINENT PART IN THE
PLAY USED IN BESTOWING UPON ME A LARGE PORTION OF HER LEISURE TO
LARD HER DISCOURSE WITH FREQUENT ALLUSIONS TO HIS SAYINGS AND DOINGS
SHE ESTEEMED HIM HIDEOUSLY PLAIN AND USED TO PROFESS HERSELF
FRIGHTENED ALMOST INTO HYSTERICS AT THE SOUND OF HIS STEP OR VOICE
A
DARK LITTLE MAN HE CERTAINLY WAS PUNGENT AND AUSTERE
EVEN TO ME HE
SEEMED A HARSH APPARITION WITH HIS CLOSE SHORN BLACK HEAD HIS BROAD
SALLOW BROW HIS THIN CHEEK HIS WIDE AND QUIVERING NOSTRIL HIS
THOROUGH GLANCE AND HURRIED BEARING
IRRITABLE HE WAS ONE HEARD THAT
AS HE APOSTROPHIZED WITH VEHEMENCE THE AWKWARD SQUAD UNDER HIS ORDERS
SOMETIMES HE WOULD BREAK OUT ON THESE RAW AMATEUR ACTRESSES WITH A
PASSION OF IMPATIENCE AT THEIR FALSENESS OF CONCEPTION THEIR COLDNESS
OF EMOTION THEIR FEEBLENESS OF DELIVERY
ECOUTEZ HE WOULD CRY AND
THEN HIS VOICE RANG THROUGH THE PREMISES LIKE A TRUMPET AND WHEN
MIMICKING IT CAME THE SMALL PIPE OF A GINEVRA A MATHILDE OR A
BLANCHE ONE UNDERSTOOD WHY A HOLLOW GROAN OF SCORN OR A FIERCE HISS
OF RAGE REWARDED THE TAME ECHO
VOUS N'TES DONC QUE DES POUPES I HEARD HIM THUNDER
VOUS N'AVEZ
PAS DE PASSIONS VOUS AUTRES
VOUS NE SENTEZ DONC RIEN VOTRE CHAIR EST
DE NEIGE VOTRE SANG DE GLACE MOI JE VEUX QUE TOUT CELA S'ALLUME
QU'IL AIT UNE VIE UNE ME
VAIN RESOLVE AND WHEN HE AT LAST FOUND IT WAS VAIN HE SUDDENLY
BROKE THE WHOLE BUSINESS DOWN
HITHERTO HE HAD BEEN TEACHING THEM A
GRAND TRAGEDY HE TORE THE TRAGEDY IN MORSELS AND CAME NEXT DAY WITH A
COMPACT LITTLE COMIC TRIFLE
TO THIS THEY TOOK MORE KINDLY HE
PRESENTLY KNOCKED IT ALL INTO THEIR SMOOTH ROUND PATES
MADEMOISELLE ST
PIERRE ALWAYS PRESIDED AT M
EMANUEL'S LESSONS AND I
WAS TOLD THAT THE POLISH OF HER MANNER HER SEEMING ATTENTION HER TACT
AND GRACE IMPRESSED THAT GENTLEMAN VERY FAVOURABLY
SHE HAD INDEED
THE ART OF PLEASING FOR A GIVEN TIME WHOM SHE WOULD BUT THE FEELING
WOULD NOT LAST IN AN HOUR IT WAS DRIED LIKE DEW VANISHED LIKE
GOSSAMER
THE DAY PRECEDING MADAME'S FTE WAS AS MUCH A HOLIDAY AS THE FTE
ITSELF
IT WAS DEVOTED TO CLEARING OUT CLEANING ARRANGING AND
DECORATING THE THREE SCHOOLROOMS
ALL WITHIN DOORS WAS THE GAYEST
BUSTLE NEITHER UP STAIRS NOR DOWN COULD A QUIET ISOLATED PERSON FIND
REST FOR THE SOLE OF HER FOOT ACCORDINGLY FOR MY PART I TOOK REFUGE
IN THE GARDEN
THE WHOLE DAY DID I WANDER OR SIT THERE ALONE FINDING
WARMTH IN THE SUN SHELTER AMONG THE TREES AND A SORT OF COMPANIONSHIP
IN MY OWN THOUGHTS
I WELL REMEMBER THAT I EXCHANGED BUT TWO SENTENCES
THAT DAY WITH ANY LIVING BEING NOT THAT I FELT SOLITARY I WAS GLAD TO
BE QUIET
FOR A LOOKER ON IT SUFFICED TO PASS THROUGH THE ROOMS ONCE
OR TWICE OBSERVE WHAT CHANGES WERE BEING WROUGHT HOW A GREEN ROOM AND
A DRESSING ROOM WERE BEING CONTRIVED A LITTLE STAGE WITH SCENERY
ERECTED HOW M
PAUL EMANUEL IN CONJUNCTION WITH MADEMOISELLE ST
PIERRE WAS DIRECTING ALL AND HOW AN EAGER BAND OF PUPILS AMONGST
THEM GINEVRA FANSHAWE WERE WORKING GAILY UNDER HIS CONTROL
THE GREAT DAY ARRIVED
THE SUN ROSE HOT AND UNCLOUDED AND HOT AND
UNCLOUDED IT BURNED ON TILL EVENING
ALL THE DOORS AND ALL THE WINDOWS
WERE SET OPEN WHICH GAVE A PLEASANT SENSE OF SUMMER FREEDOM AND
FREEDOM THE MOST COMPLETE SEEMED INDEED THE ORDER OF THE DAY
TEACHERS
AND PUPILS DESCENDED TO BREAKFAST IN DRESSING GOWNS AND CURL PAPERS
ANTICIPATING AVEC DLICES THE TOILETTE OF THE EVENING THEY SEEMED TO
TAKE A PLEASURE IN INDULGING THAT FORENOON IN A LUXURY OF SLOVENLINESS
LIKE ALDERMEN FASTING IN PREPARATION FOR A FEAST
ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK
A M AN IMPORTANT FUNCTIONARY THE COIFFEUR ARRIVED
SACRILEGIOUS
TO STATE HE FIXED HIS HEAD QUARTERS IN THE ORATORY AND THERE IN
PRESENCE OF BNITIER CANDLE AND CRUCIFIX SOLEMNISED THE MYSTERIES
OF HIS ART
EACH GIRL WAS SUMMONED IN TURN TO PASS THROUGH HIS HANDS
EMERGING FROM THEM WITH HEAD AS SMOOTH AS A SHELL INTERSECTED BY
FAULTLESS WHITE LINES AND WREATHED ABOUT WITH GRECIAN PLAITS THAT
SHONE AS IF LACQUERED
I TOOK MY TURN WITH THE REST AND COULD HARDLY
BELIEVE WHAT THE GLASS SAID WHEN I APPLIED TO IT FOR INFORMATION
AFTERWARDS THE LAVISHED GARLANDRY OF WOVEN BROWN HAIR AMAZED ME I
FEARED IT WAS NOT ALL MY OWN AND IT REQUIRED SEVERAL CONVINCING PULLS
TO GIVE ASSURANCE TO THE CONTRARY
I THEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE COIFFEUR
A FIRST RATE ARTIST ONE WHO CERTAINLY MADE THE MOST OF INDIFFERENT
MATERIALS
THE ORATORY CLOSED THE DORMITORY BECAME THE SCENE OF ABLUTIONS
ARRAYINGS AND BEDIZENINGS CURIOUSLY ELABORATE
TO ME IT WAS AND EVER
MUST BE AN ENIGMA HOW THEY CONTRIVED TO SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN DOING SO
LITTLE
THE OPERATION SEEMED CLOSE INTRICATE PROLONGED THE RESULT
SIMPLE
A CLEAR WHITE MUSLIN DRESS A BLUE SASH THE VIRGIN'S COLOURS
A PAIR OF WHITE OR STRAW COLOUR KID GLOVES SUCH WAS THE GALA UNIFORM
TO THE ASSUMPTION WHEREOF THAT HOUSEFUL OF TEACHERS AND PUPILS DEVOTED
THREE MORTAL HOURS
BUT THOUGH SIMPLE IT MUST BE ALLOWED THE ARRAY WAS
PERFECT PERFECT IN FASHION FIT AND FRESHNESS EVERY HEAD BEING ALSO
DRESSED WITH EXQUISITE NICETY AND A CERTAIN COMPACT TASTE SUITING THE
FULL FIRM COMELINESS OF LABASSECOURIEN CONTOURS THOUGH TOO STIFF FOR
ANY MORE FLOWING AND FLEXIBLE STYLE OF BEAUTY THE GENERAL EFFECT WAS
ON THE WHOLE COMMENDABLE
IN BEHOLDING THIS DIAPHANOUS AND SNOWY MASS I WELL REMEMBER FEELING
MYSELF TO BE A MERE SHADOWY SPOT ON A FIELD OF LIGHT THE COURAGE WAS
NOT IN ME TO PUT ON A TRANSPARENT WHITE DRESS SOMETHING THIN I MUST
WEAR THE WEATHER AND ROOMS BEING TOO HOT TO GIVE SUBSTANTIAL FABRICS
SUFFERANCE SO I HAD SOUGHT THROUGH A DOZEN SHOPS TILL I LIT UPON A
CRAPE LIKE MATERIAL OF PURPLE GRAY THE COLOUR IN SHORT OF DUN MIST
LYING ON A MOOR IN BLOOM
MY TAILLEUSE HAD KINDLY MADE IT AS WELL AS
SHE COULD BECAUSE AS SHE JUDICIOUSLY OBSERVED IT WAS SI TRISTE SI
PEN VOYANT CARE IN THE FASHION WAS THE MORE IMPERATIVE IT WAS WELL
SHE TOOK THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER FOR I HAD NO FLOWER NO JEWEL TO
RELIEVE IT AND WHAT WAS MORE I HAD NO NATURAL ROSE OF COMPLEXION
WE BECOME OBLIVIOUS OF THESE DEFICIENCIES IN THE UNIFORM ROUTINE OF
DAILY DRUDGERY BUT THEY WILL FORCE UPON US THEIR UNWELCOME BLANK ON
THOSE BRIGHT OCCASIONS WHEN BEAUTY SHOULD SHINE
HOWEVER IN THIS SAME GOWN OF SHADOW I FELT AT HOME AND AT EASE AN
ADVANTAGE I SHOULD NOT HAVE ENJOYED IN ANYTHING MORE BRILLIANT OR
STRIKING
MADAME BECK TOO KEPT ME IN COUNTENANCE HER DRESS WAS
ALMOST AS QUIET AS MINE EXCEPT THAT SHE WORE A BRACELET AND A LARGE
BROOCH BRIGHT WITH GOLD AND FINE STONES
WE CHANCED TO MEET ON THE
STAIRS AND SHE GAVE ME A NOD AND SMILE OF APPROBATION
NOT THAT SHE
THOUGHT I WAS LOOKING WELL A POINT UNLIKELY TO ENGAGE HER
INTEREST BUT SHE CONSIDERED ME DRESSED CONVENABLEMENT DCEMMENT
AND LA CONVENANCE ET LA DCENCE WERE THE TWO CALM DEITIES OF MADAME'S
WORSHIP
SHE EVEN PAUSED LAID ON MY SHOULDER HER GLOVED HAND HOLDING
AN EMBROIDERED AND PERFUMED HANDKERCHIEF AND CONFIDED TO MY EAR A
SARCASM ON THE OTHER TEACHERS WHOM SHE HAD JUST BEEN COMPLIMENTING TO
THEIR FACES
NOTHING SO ABSURD SHE SAID AS FOR DES FEMMES MRES
'TO DRESS THEMSELVES LIKE GIRLS OF FIFTEEN' QUANT LA
ST
PIERRE
ELLE A L'AIR D'UNE VIEILLE COQUETTE QUI FAIT L'INGNUE
BEING DRESSED AT LEAST A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE I FELT A
PLEASURE IN BETAKING MYSELF NOT TO THE GARDEN WHERE SERVANTS WERE
BUSY PROPPING UP LONG TABLES PLACING SEATS AND SPREADING CLOTHS IN
READINESS FOR THE COLLATION BUT TO THE SCHOOLROOMS NOW EMPTY QUIET
COOL AND CLEAN THEIR WALLS FRESH STAINED THEIR PLANKED FLOORS FRESH
SCOURED AND SCARCE DRY FLOWERS FRESH GATHERED ADORNING THE RECESSES IN
POTS AND DRAPERIES FRESH HUNG BEAUTIFYING THE GREAT WINDOWS
WITHDRAWING TO THE FIRST CLASSE A SMALLER AND NEATER ROOM THAN THE
OTHERS AND TAKING FROM THE GLAZED BOOKCASE OF WHICH I KEPT THE KEY A
VOLUME WHOSE TITLE PROMISED SOME INTEREST I SAT DOWN TO READ
THE
GLASS DOOR OF THIS CLASSE OR SCHOOLROOM OPENED INTO THE LARGE
BERCEAU ACACIA BOUGHS CARESSED ITS PANES AS THEY STRETCHED ACROSS TO
MEET A ROSE BUSH BLOOMING BY THE OPPOSITE LINTEL IN THIS ROSE BUSH
BEES MURMURED BUSY AND HAPPY
I COMMENCED READING
JUST AS THE STILLY
HUM THE EMBOWERING SHADE THE WARM LONELY CALM OF MY RETREAT WERE
BEGINNING TO STEAL MEANING FROM THE PAGE VISION FROM MY EYES AND TO
LURE ME ALONG THE TRACK OF REVERIE DOWN INTO SOME DEEP DELL OF
DREAMLAND JUST THEN THE SHARPEST RING OF THE STREET DOOR BELL TO
WHICH THAT MUCH TRIED INSTRUMENT HAD EVER THRILLED SNATCHED ME BACK TO
CONSCIOUSNESS
NOW THE BELL HAD BEEN RINGING ALL THE MORNING AS WORKMEN OR SERVANTS
OR COIFFEURS OR TAILLEUSES WENT AND CAME ON THEIR SEVERAL
ERRANDS
MOREOVER THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO EXPECT IT WOULD RING ALL
THE AFTERNOON SINCE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED EXTERNES WERE YET TO ARRIVE IN
CARRIAGES OR FIACRES NOR COULD IT BE EXPECTED TO REST DURING THE
EVENING WHEN PARENTS AND FRIENDS WOULD GATHER THRONGING TO THE PLAY
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES A RING EVEN A SHARP RING WAS A MATTER OF
COURSE YET THIS PARTICULAR PEAL HAD AN ACCENT OF ITS OWN WHICH CHASED
MY DREAM AND STARTLED MY BOOK FROM MY KNEE
I WAS STOOPING TO PICK UP THIS LAST WHEN FIRM FAST STRAIGHT RIGHT
ON THROUGH VESTIBULE ALONG CORRIDOR ACROSS CARR THROUGH FIRST
DIVISION SECOND DIVISION GRAND SALLE STRODE A STEP QUICK REGULAR
INTENT
THE CLOSED DOOR OF THE FIRST CLASSE MY SANCTUARY OFFERED NO
OBSTACLE IT BURST OPEN AND A PALETT AND A BONNET GREC FILLED THE
VOID ALSO TWO EYES FIRST VAGUELY STRUCK UPON AND THEN HUNGRILY DIVED
INTO ME
C'EST CELA SAID A VOICE
JE LA CONNAIS C'EST L'ANGLAISE
TANT PIS
TOUTE ANGLAISE ET PAR CONSQUENT TOUTE BGUEULE QU'ELLE SOIT ELLE
FERA MON AFFAIRE OU JE SAURAI POURQUOI
THEN WITH A CERTAIN STERN POLITENESS I SUPPOSE HE THOUGHT I HAD NOT
CAUGHT THE DRIFT OF HIS PREVIOUS UNCIVIL MUTTERINGS AND IN A JARGON
THE MOST EXECRABLE THAT EVER WAS HEARD MEESS PLAY YOU MUST I AM
PLANTED THERE
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU M
PAUL EMANUEL I INQUIRED FOR M
PAUL
EMANUEL IT WAS AND IN A STATE OF NO LITTLE EXCITEMENT
PLAY YOU MUST
I WILL NOT HAVE YOU SHRINK OR FROWN OR MAKE THE
PRUDE
I READ YOUR SKULL THAT NIGHT YOU CAME I SEE YOUR MOYENS PLAY
YOU CAN PLAY YOU MUST
BUT HOW M
PAUL WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THERE IS NO TIME TO BE LOST HE WENT ON NOW SPEAKING IN FRENCH AND
LET US THRUST TO THE WALL ALL RELUCTANCE ALL EXCUSES ALL MINAUDERIES
YOU MUST TAKE A PART
IN THE VAUDEVILLE
IN THE VAUDEVILLE
YOU HAVE SAID IT
I GASPED HORROR STRUCK
WHAT DID THE LITTLE MAN MEAN
LISTEN HE SAID
THE CASE SHALL BE STATED AND YOU SHALL THEN ANSWER
ME YES OR NO AND ACCORDING TO YOUR ANSWER SHALL I EVER AFTER ESTIMATE
YOU
THE SCARCE SUPPRESSED IMPETUS OF A MOST IRRITABLE NATURE GLOWED IN HIS
CHEEK FED WITH SHARP SHAFTS HIS GLANCES A NATURE THE INJUDICIOUS
THE MAWKISH THE HESITATING THE SULLEN THE AFFECTED ABOVE ALL THE
UNYIELDING MIGHT QUICKLY RENDER VIOLENT AND IMPLACABLE
SILENCE AND
ATTENTION WAS THE BEST BALM TO APPLY I LISTENED
THE WHOLE MATTER IS GOING TO FAIL HE BEGAN
LOUISE VANDERKELKOV HAS
FALLEN ILL AT LEAST SO HER RIDICULOUS MOTHER ASSERTS FOR MY PART I
FEEL SURE SHE MIGHT PLAY IF SHE WOULD IT IS ONLY GOOD WILL THAT LACKS
SHE WAS CHARGED WITH A RLE AS YOU KNOW OR DO NOT KNOW IT IS
EQUAL WITHOUT THAT RLE THE PLAY IS STOPPED
THERE ARE NOW BUT A FEW
HOURS IN WHICH TO LEARN IT NOT A GIRL IN THIS SCHOOL WOULD HEAR
REASON AND ACCEPT THE TASK
FORSOOTH IT IS NOT AN INTERESTING NOT AN
AMIABLE PART THEIR VILE AMOUR PROPRE THAT BASE QUALITY OF WHICH
WOMEN HAVE SO MUCH WOULD REVOLT FROM IT
ENGLISHWOMEN ARE EITHER THE
BEST OR THE WORST OF THEIR SEX
DIEU SAIT QUE JE LES DTESTE COMME LA
PESTE ORDINAIREMENT THIS BETWEEN HIS RECREANT TEETH
I APPLY TO AN
ENGLISHWOMAN TO RESCUE ME
WHAT IS HER ANSWER YES OR NO
A THOUSAND OBJECTIONS RUSHED INTO MY MIND
THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE THE
LIMITED TIME THE PUBLIC DISPLAY
INCLINATION RECOILED ABILITY
FALTERED SELF RESPECT THAT VILE QUALITY TREMBLED
NON NON NON
SAID ALL THESE BUT LOOKING UP AT M
PAUL AND SEEING IN HIS VEXED
FIERY AND SEARCHING EYE A SORT OF APPEAL BEHIND ALL ITS MENACE MY
LIPS DROPPED THE WORD OUI
FOR A MOMENT HIS RIGID COUNTENANCE RELAXED
WITH A QUIVER OF CONTENT QUICKLY BENT UP AGAIN HOWEVER HE WENT ON
VITE L'OUVRAGE HERE IS THE BOOK HERE IS YOUR RLE READ AND I
READ
HE DID NOT COMMEND AT SOME PASSAGES HE SCOWLED AND STAMPED
HE
GAVE ME A LESSON I DILIGENTLY IMITATED
IT WAS A DISAGREEABLE PART A
MAN'S AN EMPTY HEADED FOP'S
ONE COULD PUT INTO IT NEITHER HEART NOR
SOUL I HATED IT
THE PLAY A MERE TRIFLE RAN CHIEFLY ON THE EFFORTS
OF A BRACE OF RIVALS TO GAIN THE HAND OF A FAIR COQUETTE
ONE LOVER WAS
CALLED THE OURS A GOOD AND GALLANT BUT UNPOLISHED MAN A SORT OF
DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH THE OTHER WAS A BUTTERFLY A TALKER AND A
TRAITOR AND I WAS TO BE THE BUTTERFLY TALKER AND TRAITOR
I DID MY BEST WHICH WAS BAD I KNOW IT PROVOKED M
PAUL HE FUMED
PUTTING BOTH HANDS TO THE WORK I ENDEAVOURED TO DO BETTER THAN MY
BEST I PRESUME HE GAVE ME CREDIT FOR GOOD INTENTIONS HE PROFESSED TO
BE PARTIALLY CONTENT
CA IRA HE CRIED AND AS VOICES BEGAN SOUNDING
FROM THE GARDEN AND WHITE DRESSES FLUTTERING AMONG THE TREES HE
ADDED YOU MUST WITHDRAW YOU MUST BE ALONE TO LEARN THIS
COME WITH
ME
WITHOUT BEING ALLOWED TIME OR POWER TO DELIBERATE I FOUND MYSELF IN
THE SAME BREATH CONVOYED ALONG AS IN A SPECIES OF WHIRLWIND UP STAIRS
UP TWO PAIR OF STAIRS NAY ACTUALLY UP THREE FOR THIS FIERY LITTLE
MAN SEEMED AS BY INSTINCT TO KNOW HIS WAY EVERYWHERE TO THE SOLITARY
AND LOFTY ATTIC WAS I BORNE PUT IN AND LOCKED IN THE KEY BEING IN
THE DOOR AND THAT KEY HE TOOK WITH HIM AND VANISHED
THE ATTIC WAS NO PLEASANT PLACE I BELIEVE HE DID NOT KNOW HOW
UNPLEASANT IT WAS OR HE NEVER WOULD HAVE LOCKED ME IN WITH SO LITTLE
CEREMONY
IN THIS SUMMER WEATHER IT WAS HOT AS AFRICA AS IN WINTER
IT WAS ALWAYS COLD AS GREENLAND
BOXES AND LUMBER FILLED IT OLD
DRESSES DRAPED ITS UNSTAINED WALL COBWEBS ITS UNSWEPT CEILING
WELL
WAS IT KNOWN TO BE TENANTED BY RATS BY BLACK BEETLES AND BY
COCKROACHES NAY RUMOUR AFFIRMED THAT THE GHOSTLY NUN OF THE GARDEN
HAD ONCE BEEN SEEN HERE
A PARTIAL DARKNESS OBSCURED ONE END ACROSS
WHICH AS FOR DEEPER MYSTERY AN OLD RUSSET CURTAIN WAS DRAWN BY WAY
OF SCREEN TO A SOMBRE BAND OF WINTER CLOAKS PENDENT EACH FROM ITS PIN
LIKE A MALEFACTOR FROM HIS GIBBET
FROM AMONGST THESE CLOAKS AND
BEHIND THAT CURTAIN THE NUN WAS SAID TO ISSUE
I DID NOT BELIEVE THIS
NOR WAS I TROUBLED BY APPREHENSION THEREOF BUT I SAW A VERY DARK AND
LARGE RAT WITH A LONG TAIL COME GLIDING OUT FROM THAT SQUALID ALCOVE
AND MOREOVER MY EYE FELL ON MANY A BLACK BEETLE DOTTING THE FLOOR
THESE OBJECTS DISCOMPOSED ME MORE PERHAPS THAN IT WOULD BE WISE TO
SAY AS ALSO DID THE DUST LUMBER AND STIFLING HEAT OF THE PLACE
THE
LAST INCONVENIENCE WOULD SOON HAVE BECOME INTOLERABLE HAD I NOT FOUND
MEANS TO OPEN AND PROP UP THE SKYLIGHT THUS ADMITTING SOME FRESHNESS
UNDERNEATH THIS APERTURE I PUSHED A LARGE EMPTY CHEST AND HAVING
MOUNTED UPON IT A SMALLER BOX AND WIPED FROM BOTH THE DUST I GATHERED
MY DRESS MY BEST THE READER MUST REMEMBER AND THEREFORE A LEGITIMATE
OBJECT OF CARE FASTIDIOUSLY AROUND ME ASCENDED THIS SPECIES OF
EXTEMPORE THRONE AND BEING SEATED COMMENCED THE ACQUISITION OF MY
TASK WHILE I LEARNED NOT FORGETTING TO KEEP A SHARP LOOK OUT ON THE
BLACK BEETLES AND COCKROACHES OF WHICH MORE EVEN I BELIEVE THAN OF
THE RATS I SAT IN MORTAL DREAD
MY IMPRESSION AT FIRST WAS THAT I HAD UNDERTAKEN WHAT IT REALLY WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO PERFORM AND I SIMPLY RESOLVED TO DO MY BEST AND BE
RESIGNED TO FAIL
I SOON FOUND HOWEVER THAT ONE PART IN SO SHORT A
PIECE WAS NOT MORE THAN MEMORY COULD MASTER AT A FEW HOURS' NOTICE
I
LEARNED AND LEARNED ON FIRST IN A WHISPER AND THEN ALOUD
PERFECTLY
SECURE FROM HUMAN AUDIENCE I ACTED MY PART BEFORE THE GARRET VERMIN
ENTERING INTO ITS EMPTINESS FRIVOLITY AND FALSEHOOD WITH A SPIRIT
INSPIRED BY SCORN AND IMPATIENCE I TOOK MY REVENGE ON THIS FAT BY
MAKING HIM AS FATUITOUS AS I POSSIBLY COULD
IN THIS EXERCISE THE AFTERNOON PASSED DAY BEGAN TO GLIDE INTO EVENING
AND I WHO HAD EATEN NOTHING SINCE BREAKFAST GREW EXCESSIVELY HUNGRY
NOW I THOUGHT OF THE COLLATION WHICH DOUBTLESS THEY WERE JUST THEN
DEVOURING IN THE GARDEN FAR BELOW
I HAD SEEN IN THE VESTIBULE A
BASKETFUL OF SMALL PTS LA CRME THAN WHICH NOTHING IN THE WHOLE
RANGE OF COOKERY SEEMED TO ME BETTER
A PT OR A SQUARE OF CAKE
IT SEEMED TO ME WOULD COME VERY PROPOS AND AS MY RELISH FOR THOSE
DAINTIES INCREASED IT BEGAN TO APPEAR SOMEWHAT HARD THAT I SHOULD PASS
MY HOLIDAY FASTING AND IN PRISON
REMOTE AS WAS THE ATTIC FROM THE
STREET DOOR AND VESTIBULE YET THE EVER TINKLING BELL WAS FAINTLY
AUDIBLE HERE AND ALSO THE CEASELESS ROLL OF WHEELS ON THE TORMENTED
PAVEMENT
I KNEW THAT THE HOUSE AND GARDEN WERE THRONGED AND THAT ALL
WAS GAY AND GLAD BELOW HERE IT BEGAN TO GROW DUSK THE BEETLES WERE
FADING FROM MY SIGHT I TREMBLED LEST THEY SHOULD STEAL ON ME A MARCH
MOUNT MY THRONE UNSEEN AND UNSUSPECTED INVADE MY SKIRTS
IMPATIENT
AND APPREHENSIVE I RECOMMENCED THE REHEARSAL OF MY PART MERELY TO KILL
TIME
JUST AS I WAS CONCLUDING THE LONG DELAYED RATTLE OF THE KEY IN
THE LOCK CAME TO MY EAR NO UNWELCOME SOUND
M
PAUL I COULD JUST SEE
THROUGH THE DUSK THAT IT WAS M
PAUL FOR LIGHT ENOUGH STILL LINGERED
TO SHOW THE VELVET BLACKNESS OF HIS CLOSE SHORN HEAD AND THE SALLOW
IVORY OF HIS BROW LOOKED IN
BRAVA CRIED HE HOLDING THE DOOR OPEN AND REMAINING AT THE
THRESHOLD
J'AI TOUT ENTENDU
C'EST ASSEZ BIEN
ENCORE
A MOMENT I HESITATED
ENCORE SAID HE STERNLY
ET POINT DE GRIMACES A BAS LA TIMIDIT
AGAIN I WENT THROUGH THE PART BUT NOT HALF SO WELL AS I HAD SPOKEN IT
ALONE
ENFIN ELLE SAIT SAID HE HALF DISSATISFIED AND ONE CANNOT BE
FASTIDIOUS OR EXACTING UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEN HE ADDED YOU
MAY YET HAVE TWENTY MINUTES FOR PREPARATION AU REVOIR AND HE WAS
GOING
MONSIEUR I CALLED OUT TAKING COURAGE
EH BIEN QU'EST CE QUE C'EST MADEMOISELLE
J'AI BIEN FAIM
COMMENT VOUS AVEZ FAIM ET LA COLLATION
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
I HAVE NOT SEEN IT SHUT UP HERE
AH C'EST VRAI CRIED HE
IN A MOMENT MY THRONE WAS ABDICATED THE ATTIC EVACUATED AN INVERSE
REPETITION OF THE IMPETUS WHICH HAD BROUGHT ME UP INTO THE ATTIC
INSTANTLY TOOK ME DOWN DOWN DOWN TO THE VERY KITCHEN
I THOUGHT I
SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE CELLAR
THE COOK WAS IMPERATIVELY ORDERED TO
PRODUCE FOOD AND I AS IMPERATIVELY WAS COMMANDED TO EAT
TO MY GREAT
JOY THIS FOOD WAS LIMITED TO COFFEE AND CAKE I HAD FEARED WINE AND
SWEETS WHICH I DID NOT LIKE
HOW HE GUESSED THAT I SHOULD LIKE A
PETIT PT LA CRME I CANNOT TELL BUT HE WENT OUT AND PROCURED ME
ONE FROM SOME QUARTER
WITH CONSIDERABLE WILLINGNESS I ATE AND DRANK
KEEPING THE PETIT PT TILL THE LAST AS A BONNE BOUCHE
M
PAUL
SUPERINTENDED MY REPAST AND ALMOST FORCED UPON ME MORE THAN I COULD
SWALLOW
A LA BONNE HEURE HE CRIED WHEN I SIGNIFIED THAT I REALLY COULD TAKE
NO MORE AND WITH UPLIFTED HANDS IMPLORED TO BE SPARED THE ADDITIONAL
ROLL ON WHICH HE HAD JUST SPREAD BUTTER
YOU WILL SET ME DOWN AS A
SPECIES OF TYRANT AND BLUEBEARD STARVING WOMEN IN A GARRET WHEREAS
AFTER ALL I AM NO SUCH THING
NOW MADEMOISELLE DO YOU FEEL COURAGE
AND STRENGTH TO APPEAR
I SAID I THOUGHT I DID THOUGH IN TRUTH I WAS PERFECTLY CONFUSED
AND COULD HARDLY TELL HOW I FELT BUT THIS LITTLE MAN WAS OF THE ORDER
OF BEINGS WHO MUST NOT BE OPPOSED UNLESS YOU POSSESSED AN ALL DOMINANT
FORCE SUFFICIENT TO CRUSH HIM AT ONCE
COME THEN SAID HE OFFERING HIS HAND
I GAVE HIM MINE AND HE SET OFF WITH A RAPID WALK WHICH OBLIGED ME TO
RUN AT HIS SIDE IN ORDER TO KEEP PACE
IN THE CARR HE STOPPED A
MOMENT IT WAS LIT WITH LARGE LAMPS THE WIDE DOORS OF THE CLASSES WERE
OPEN AND SO WERE THE EQUALLY WIDE GARDEN DOORS ORANGE TREES IN TUBS
AND TALL FLOWERS IN POTS ORNAMENTED THESE PORTALS ON EACH SIDE GROUPS
OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IN EVENING DRESS STOOD AND WALKED AMONGST THE
FLOWERS
WITHIN THE LONG VISTA OF THE SCHOOL ROOMS PRESENTED A
THRONGING UNDULATING MURMURING WAVING STREAMING MULTITUDE ALL
ROSE AND BLUE AND HALF TRANSLUCENT WHITE
THERE WERE LUSTRES BURNING
OVERHEAD FAR OFF THERE WAS A STAGE A SOLEMN GREEN CURTAIN A ROW OF
FOOTLIGHTS
NEST CE PAS QUE C'EST BEAU DEMANDED MY COMPANION
I SHOULD HAVE SAID IT WAS BUT MY HEART GOT UP INTO MY THROAT
M
PAUL
DISCOVERED THIS AND GAVE ME A SIDE SCOWL AND A LITTLE SHAKE FOR MY
PAINS
I WILL DO MY BEST BUT I WISH IT WAS OVER SAID I THEN I ASKED ARE
WE TO WALK THROUGH THAT CROWD
BY NO MEANS I MANAGE MATTERS BETTER WE PASS THROUGH THE
GARDEN HERE
IN AN INSTANT WE WERE OUT OF DOORS THE COOL CALM NIGHT REVIVED ME
SOMEWHAT
IT WAS MOONLESS BUT THE REFLEX FROM THE MANY GLOWING WINDOWS
LIT THE COURT BRIGHTLY AND EVEN THE ALLEYS DIMLY
HEAVEN WAS
CLOUDLESS AND GRAND WITH THE QUIVER OF ITS LIVING FIRES
HOW SOFT ARE
THE NIGHTS OF THE CONTINENT HOW BLAND BALMY SAFE NO SEA FOG NO
CHILLING DAMP MISTLESS AS NOON AND FRESH AS MORNING
HAVING CROSSED COURT AND GARDEN WE REACHED THE GLASS DOOR OF THE FIRST
CLASSE
IT STOOD OPEN LIKE ALL OTHER DOORS THAT NIGHT WE PASSED AND
THEN I WAS USHERED INTO A SMALL CABINET DIVIDING THE FIRST CLASSE FROM
THE GRAND SALLE
THIS CABINET DAZZLED ME IT WAS SO FULL OF LIGHT IT
DEAFENED ME IT WAS CLAMOROUS WITH VOICES IT STIFLED ME IT WAS SO
HOT CHOKING THRONGED
DE L'ORDRE DU SILENCE CRIED M
PAUL
IS THIS CHAOS HE DEMANDED
AND THERE WAS A HUSH
WITH A DOZEN WORDS AND AS MANY GESTURES HE
TURNED OUT HALF THE PERSONS PRESENT AND OBLIGED THE REMNANT TO FALL
INTO RANK
THOSE LEFT WERE ALL IN COSTUME THEY WERE THE PERFORMERS
AND THIS WAS THE GREEN ROOM
M
PAUL INTRODUCED ME
ALL STARED AND SOME
TITTERED
IT WAS A SURPRISE THEY HAD NOT EXPECTED THE ENGLISHWOMAN
WOULD PLAY IN A VAUDEVILLE
GINEVRA FANSHAWE BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED FOR
HER PART AND LOOKING FASCINATINGLY PRETTY TURNED ON ME A PAIR OF EYES
AS ROUND AS BEADS
IN THE HIGHEST SPIRIT UNPERTURBED BY FEAR OR
BASHFULNESS DELIGHTED INDEED AT THE THOUGHT OF SHINING OFF BEFORE
HUNDREDS MY ENTRANCE SEEMED TO TRANSFIX HER WITH AMAZEMENT IN THE
MIDST OF HER JOY
SHE WOULD HAVE EXCLAIMED BUT M
PAUL HELD HER AND
ALL THE REST IN CHECK
HAVING SURVEYED AND CRITICIZED THE WHOLE TROOP HE TURNED TO ME
YOU TOO MUST BE DRESSED FOR YOUR PART
DRESSED DRESSED LIKE A MAN EXCLAIMED ZLIE ST
PIERRE DARTING
FORWARDS ADDING WITH OFFICIOUSNESS I WILL DRESS HER MYSELF
TO BE DRESSED LIKE A MAN DID NOT PLEASE AND WOULD NOT SUIT ME
I HAD
CONSENTED TO TAKE A MAN'S NAME AND PART AS TO HIS DRESS HALTE L
NO
I WOULD KEEP MY OWN DRESS COME WHAT MIGHT
M
PAUL MIGHT STORM
MIGHT RAGE I WOULD KEEP MY OWN DRESS
I SAID SO WITH A VOICE AS
RESOLUTE IN INTENT AS IT WAS LOW AND PERHAPS UNSTEADY IN UTTERANCE
HE DID NOT IMMEDIATELY STORM OR RAGE AS I FULLY THOUGHT HE WOULD HE
STOOD SILENT
BUT ZLIE AGAIN INTERPOSED
SHE WILL MAKE A CAPITAL PETIT MITRE
HERE ARE THE GARMENTS
ALL ALL COMPLETE SOMEWHAT TOO LARGE BUT I WILL ARRANGE ALL THAT
COME CHRE AMIE BELLE ANGLAISE
AND SHE SNEERED FOR I WAS NOT BELLE SHE SEIZED MY HAND SHE WAS
DRAWING ME AWAY
M
PAUL STOOD IMPASSABLE NEUTRAL
YOU MUST NOT RESIST PURSUED ST
PIERRE FOR RESIST I DID
YOU WILL
SPOIL ALL DESTROY THE MIRTH OF THE PIECE THE ENJOYMENT OF THE
COMPANY SACRIFICE EVERYTHING TO YOUR AMOUR PROPRE
THIS WOULD BE TOO
BAD MONSIEUR WILL NEVER PERMIT THIS
SHE SOUGHT HIS EYE
I WATCHED LIKEWISE FOR A GLANCE
HE GAVE HER ONE
AND THEN HE GAVE ME ONE
STOP HE SAID SLOWLY ARRESTING ST
PIERRE
WHO CONTINUED HER EFFORTS TO DRAG ME AFTER HER
EVERYBODY AWAITED THE
DECISION
HE WAS NOT ANGRY NOT IRRITATED I PERCEIVED THAT AND TOOK
HEART
YOU DO NOT LIKE THESE CLOTHES HE ASKED POINTING TO THE MASCULINE
VESTMENTS
I DON'T OBJECT TO SOME OF THEM BUT I WON'T HAVE THEM ALL
HOW MUST IT BE THEN HOW ACCEPT A MAN'S PART AND GO ON THE STAGE
DRESSED AS A WOMAN THIS IS AN AMATEUR AFFAIR IT IS TRUE A
VAUDEVILLE DE PENSIONNAT CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS I MIGHT SANCTION YET
SOMETHING YOU MUST HAVE TO ANNOUNCE YOU AS OF THE NOBLER SEX
AND I WILL MONSIEUR BUT IT MUST BE ARRANGED IN MY OWN WAY NOBODY
MUST MEDDLE THE THINGS MUST NOT BE FORCED UPON ME
JUST LET ME DRESS
MYSELF
MONSIEUR WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD TOOK THE COSTUME FROM ST
PIERRE GAVE
IT TO ME AND PERMITTED ME TO PASS INTO THE DRESSING ROOM
ONCE ALONE
I GREW CALM AND COLLECTEDLY WENT TO WORK
RETAINING MY WOMAN'S GARB
WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST RETRENCHMENT I MERELY ASSUMED IN ADDITION A
LITTLE VEST A COLLAR AND CRAVAT AND A PALETT OF SMALL DIMENSIONS
THE WHOLE BEING THE COSTUME OF A BROTHER OF ONE OF THE PUPILS
HAVING
LOOSENED MY HAIR OUT OF ITS BRAIDS MADE UP THE LONG BACK HAIR CLOSE
AND BRUSHED THE FRONT HAIR TO ONE SIDE I TOOK MY HAT AND GLOVES IN MY
HAND AND CAME OUT
M
PAUL WAS WAITING AND SO WERE THE OTHERS
HE
LOOKED AT ME
THAT MAY PASS IN A PENSIONNAT HE PRONOUNCED
THEN
ADDED NOT UNKINDLY COURAGE MON AMI UN PEU DE SANGFROID UN PEU
D'APLOMB M
LUCIEN ET TOUT IRA BIEN
ST
PIERRE SNEERED AGAIN IN HER COLD SNAKY MANNER
I WAS IRRITABLE BECAUSE EXCITED AND I COULD NOT HELP TURNING UPON HER
AND SAYING THAT IF SHE WERE NOT A LADY AND I A GENTLEMAN I SHOULD
FEEL DISPOSED TO CALL HER OUT
AFTER THE PLAY AFTER THE PLAY SAID M
PAUL
I WILL THEN DIVIDE MY
PAIR OF PISTOLS BETWEEN YOU AND WE WILL SETTLE THE DISPUTE ACCORDING
TO FORM IT WILL ONLY BE THE OLD QUARREL OF FRANCE AND ENGLAND
BUT NOW THE MOMENT APPROACHED FOR THE PERFORMANCE TO COMMENCE
M
PAUL
SETTING US BEFORE HIM HARANGUED US BRIEFLY LIKE A GENERAL ADDRESSING
SOLDIERS ABOUT TO CHARGE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SAID EXCEPT THAT HE
RECOMMENDED EACH TO PENETRATE HERSELF WITH A SENSE OF HER PERSONAL
INSIGNIFICANCE
GOD KNOWS I THOUGHT THIS ADVICE SUPERFLUOUS FOR SOME OF
US
A BELL TINKLED
I AND TWO MORE WERE USHERED ON TO THE STAGE
THE
BELL TINKLED AGAIN
I HAD TO SPEAK THE VERY FIRST WORDS
DO NOT LOOK AT THE CROWD NOR THINK OF IT WHISPERED M
PAUL IN MY
EAR
IMAGINE YOURSELF IN THE GARRET ACTING TO THE RATS
HE VANISHED
THE CURTAIN DREW UP SHRIVELLED TO THE CEILING THE BRIGHT
LIGHTS THE LONG ROOM THE GAY THRONG BURST UPON US
I THOUGHT OF THE
BLACK BEETLES THE OLD BOXES THE WORM EATEN BUREAU
I SAID MY SAY
BADLY BUT I SAID IT
THAT FIRST SPEECH WAS THE DIFFICULTY IT REVEALED
TO ME THIS FACT THAT IT WAS NOT THE CROWD I FEARED SO MUCH AS MY OWN
VOICE
FOREIGNERS AND STRANGERS THE CROWD WERE NOTHING TO ME
NOR DID
I THINK OF THEM
WHEN MY TONGUE ONCE GOT FREE AND MY VOICE TOOK ITS
TRUE PITCH AND FOUND ITS NATURAL TONE I THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE
PERSONAGE I REPRESENTED AND OF M
PAUL WHO WAS LISTENING WATCHING
PROMPTING IN THE SIDE SCENES
BY AND BY FEELING THE RIGHT POWER COME THE SPRING DEMANDED GUSH AND
RISE INWARDLY I BECAME SUFFICIENTLY COMPOSED TO NOTICE MY
FELLOW ACTORS
SOME OF THEM PLAYED VERY WELL ESPECIALLY GINEVRA
FANSHAWE WHO HAD TO COQUETTE BETWEEN TWO SUITORS AND MANAGED
ADMIRABLY IN FACT SHE WAS IN HER ELEMENT
I OBSERVED THAT SHE ONCE OR
TWICE THREW A CERTAIN MARKED FONDNESS AND POINTED PARTIALITY INTO HER
MANNER TOWARDS ME THE FOP
WITH SUCH EMPHASIS AND ANIMATION DID SHE
FAVOUR ME SUCH GLANCES DID SHE DART OUT INTO THE LISTENING AND
APPLAUDING CROWD THAT TO ME WHO KNEW HER IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT
SHE WAS ACTING AT SOME ONE AND I FOLLOWED HER EYE HER SMILE HER
GESTURE AND ERE LONG DISCOVERED THAT SHE HAD AT LEAST SINGLED OUT A
HANDSOME AND DISTINGUISHED AIM FOR HER SHAFTS FULL IN THE PATH OF
THOSE ARROWS TALLER THAN OTHER SPECTATORS AND THEREFORE MORE SURE TO
RECEIVE THEM STOOD IN ATTITUDE QUIET BUT INTENT A WELL KNOWN
FORM THAT OF DR
JOHN
THE SPECTACLE SEEMED SOMEHOW SUGGESTIVE
THERE WAS LANGUAGE IN DR
JOHN'S LOOK THOUGH I CANNOT TELL WHAT HE SAID IT ANIMATED ME I DREW
OUT OF IT A HISTORY I PUT MY IDEA INTO THE PART I PER FORMED I THREW
IT INTO MY WOOING OF GINEVRA
IN THE OURS OR SINCERE LOVER I SAW
DR
JOHN
DID I PITY HIM AS ERST NO I HARDENED MY HEART RIVALLED
AND OUT RIVALLED HIM
I KNEW MYSELF BUT A FOP BUT WHERE HE WAS
OUTCAST I COULD PLEASE
NOW I KNOW ACTED AS IF WISHFUL AND RESOLUTE
TO WIN AND CONQUER
GINEVRA SECONDED ME BETWEEN US WE HALF CHANGED THE
NATURE OF THE RLE GILDING IT FROM TOP TO TOE
BETWEEN THE ACTS M
PAUL TOLD US HE KNEW NOT WHAT POSSESSED US AND HALF EXPOSTULATED
C'EST PEUT TRE PLUS BEAU QUE VOTRE MODLE SAID HE MAIS CE N'EST
PAS JUSTE I KNOW NOT WHAT POSSESSED ME EITHER BUT SOMEHOW MY
LONGING WAS TO ECLIPSE THE OURS I E DR
JOHN
GINEVRA WAS
TENDER HOW COULD I BE OTHERWISE THAN CHIVALRIC RETAINING THE LETTER
I RECKLESSLY ALTERED THE SPIRIT OF THE RLE
WITHOUT HEART WITHOUT
INTEREST I COULD NOT PLAY IT AT ALL
IT MUST BE PLAYED IN WENT THE
YEARNED FOR SEASONING THUS FAVOURED I PLAYED IT WITH RELISH
WHAT I FELT THAT NIGHT AND WHAT I DID I NO MORE EXPECTED TO FEEL AND
DO THAN TO BE LIFTED IN A TRANCE TO THE SEVENTH HEAVEN
COLD
RELUCTANT APPREHENSIVE I HAD ACCEPTED A PART TO PLEASE ANOTHER ERE
LONG WARMING BECOMING INTERESTED TAKING COURAGE I ACTED TO PLEASE
MYSELF
YET THE NEXT DAY WHEN I THOUGHT IT OVER I QUITE DISAPPROVED
OF THESE AMATEUR PERFORMANCES AND THOUGH GLAD THAT I HAD OBLIGED M
PAUL AND TRIED MY OWN STRENGTH FOR ONCE I TOOK A FIRM RESOLUTION
NEVER TO BE DRAWN INTO A SIMILAR AFFAIR
A KEEN RELISH FOR DRAMATIC
EXPRESSION HAD REVEALED ITSELF AS PART OF MY NATURE TO CHERISH AND
EXERCISE THIS NEW FOUND FACULTY MIGHT GIFT ME WITH A WORLD OF DELIGHT
BUT IT WOULD NOT DO FOR A MERE LOOKER ON AT LIFE THE STRENGTH AND
LONGING MUST BE PUT BY AND I PUT THEM BY AND FASTENED THEM IN WITH
THE LOCK OF A RESOLUTION WHICH NEITHER TIME NOR TEMPTATION HAS SINCE
PICKED
NO SOONER WAS THE PLAY OVER AND WELL OVER THAN THE CHOLERIC AND
ARBITRARY M
PAUL UNDERWENT A METAMORPHOSIS
HIS HOUR OF MANAGERIAL
RESPONSIBILITY PAST HE AT ONCE LAID ASIDE HIS MAGISTERIAL AUSTERITY
IN A MOMENT HE STOOD AMONGST US VIVACIOUS KIND AND SOCIAL SHOOK
HANDS WITH US ALL ROUND THANKED US SEPARATELY AND ANNOUNCED HIS
DETERMINATION THAT EACH OF US SHOULD IN TURN BE HIS PARTNER IN THE
COMING BALL
ON HIS CLAIMING MY PROMISE I TOLD HIM I DID NOT DANCE
FOR ONCE I MUST WAS THE ANSWER AND IF I HAD NOT SLIPPED ASIDE AND
KEPT OUT OF HIS WAY HE WOULD HAVE COMPELLED ME TO THIS SECOND
PERFORMANCE
BUT I HAD ACTED ENOUGH FOR ONE EVENING IT WAS TIME I
RETIRED INTO MYSELF AND MY ORDINARY LIFE
MY DUN COLOURED DRESS DID
WELL ENOUGH UNDER A PALETT ON THE STAGE BUT WOULD NOT SUIT A WALTZ OR
A QUADRILLE
WITHDRAWING TO A QUIET NOOK WHENCE UNOBSERVED I COULD
OBSERVE THE BALL ITS SPLENDOURS AND ITS PLEASURES PASSED BEFORE ME
AS A SPECTACLE
AGAIN GINEVRA FANSHAWE WAS THE BELLE THE FAIREST AND THE GAYEST
PRESENT SHE WAS SELECTED TO OPEN THE BALL VERY LOVELY SHE LOOKED
VERY GRACEFULLY SHE DANCED VERY JOYOUSLY SHE SMILED
SUCH SCENES WERE
HER TRIUMPHS SHE WAS THE CHILD OF PLEASURE
WORK OR SUFFERING FOUND
HER LISTLESS AND DEJECTED POWERLESS AND REPINING BUT GAIETY EXPANDED
HER BUTTERFLY'S WINGS LIT UP THEIR GOLD DUST AND BRIGHT SPOTS MADE
HER FLASH LIKE A GEM AND FLUSH LIKE A FLOWER
AT ALL ORDINARY DIET AND
PLAIN BEVERAGE SHE WOULD POUT BUT SHE FED ON CREAMS AND ICES LIKE A
HUMMING BIRD ON HONEY PASTE SWEET WINE WAS HER ELEMENT AND SWEET CAKE
HER DAILY BREAD
GINEVRA LIVED HER FULL LIFE IN A BALL ROOM ELSEWHERE
SHE DROOPED DISPIRITED
THINK NOT READER THAT SHE THUS BLOOMED AND SPARKLED FOR THE MERE SAKE
OF M
PAUL HER PARTNER OR THAT SHE LAVISHED HER BEST GRACES THAT
NIGHT FOR THE EDIFICATION OF HER COMPANIONS ONLY OR FOR THAT OF THE
PARENTS AND GRAND PARENTS WHO FILLED THE CARR AND LINED THE
BALL ROOM UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SO INSIPID AND LIMITED WITH MOTIVES SO
CHILLY AND VAPID GINEVRA WOULD SCARCE HAVE DEIGNED TO WALK ONE
QUADRILLE AND WEARINESS AND FRETFULNESS WOULD HAVE REPLACED ANIMATION
AND GOOD HUMOUR BUT SHE KNEW OF A LEAVEN IN THE OTHERWISE HEAVY FESTAL
MASS WHICH LIGHTED THE WHOLE SHE TASTED A CONDIMENT WHICH GAVE IT
ZEST SHE PERCEIVED REASONS JUSTIFYING THE DISPLAY OF HER CHOICEST
ATTRACTIONS
IN THE BALL ROOM INDEED NOT A SINGLE MALE SPECTATOR WAS TO BE SEEN
WHO WAS NOT MARRIED AND A FATHER M
PAUL EXCEPTED THAT GENTLEMAN
TOO BEING THE SOLE CREATURE OF HIS SEX PERMITTED TO LEAD OUT A PUPIL
TO THE DANCE AND THIS EXCEPTIONAL PART WAS ALLOWED HIM PARTLY AS A
MATTER OF OLD ESTABLISHED CUSTOM FOR HE WAS A KINSMAN OF MADAME
BECK'S AND HIGH IN HER CONFIDENCE PARTLY BECAUSE HE WOULD ALWAYS
HAVE HIS OWN WAY AND DO AS HE PLEASED AND PARTLY BECAUSE WILFUL
PASSIONATE PARTIAL AS HE MIGHT BE HE WAS THE SOUL OF HONOUR AND
MIGHT BE TRUSTED WITH A REGIMENT OF THE FAIREST AND PUREST IN PERFECT
SECURITY THAT UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP THEY WOULD COME TO NO HARM
MANY OF
THE GIRLS IT MAY BE NOTED IN PARENTHESIS WERE NOT PURE MINDED AT ALL
VERY MUCH OTHERWISE BUT THEY NO MORE DARE BETRAY THEIR NATURAL
COARSENESS IN M
PAUL'S PRESENCE THAN THEY DARE TREAD PURPOSELY ON HIS
CORNS LAUGH IN HIS FACE DURING A STORMY APOSTROPHE OR SPEAK ABOVE
THEIR BREATH WHILE SOME CRISIS OF IRRITABILITY WAS COVERING HIS HUMAN
VISAGE WITH THE MASK OF AN INTELLIGENT TIGER
M
PAUL THEN MIGHT
DANCE WITH WHOM HE WOULD AND WOE BE TO THE INTERFERENCE WHICH PUT HIM
OUT OF STEP
OTHERS THERE WERE ADMITTED AS SPECTATORS WITH SEEMING RELUCTANCE
THROUGH PRAYERS BY INFLUENCE UNDER RESTRICTION BY SPECIAL AND
DIFFICULT EXERCISE OF MADAME BECK'S GRACIOUS GOOD NATURE AND WHOM SHE
ALL THE EVENING WITH HER OWN PERSONAL SURVEILLANCE KEPT FAR ALOOF AT
THE REMOTEST DREAREST COLDEST DARKEST SIDE OF THE CARR A SMALL
FORLORN BAND OF JEUNES GENS THESE BEING ALL OF THE BEST FAMILIES
GROWN UP SONS OF MOTHERS PRESENT AND WHOSE SISTERS WERE PUPILS IN THE
SCHOOL
THAT WHOLE EVENING WAS MADAME ON DUTY BESIDE THESE JEUNES
GENS ATTENTIVE TO THEM AS A MOTHER BUT STRICT WITH THEM AS A DRAGON
THERE WAS A SORT OF CORDON STRETCHED BEFORE THEM WHICH THEY WEARIED
HER WITH PRAYERS TO BE PERMITTED TO PASS AND JUST TO REVIVE THEMSELVES
BY ONE DANCE WITH THAT BELLE BLONDE OR THAT JOLIE BRUNE OR CETTE
JEUNE FILLE MAGNIFIQUE AUX CHEVEUX NOIRS COMME LE JAIS
TAISEZ VOUS MADAME WOULD REPLY HEROICALLY AND INEXORABLY
VOUS NE
PASSEREZ PAS MOINS QUE CE NE SOIT SUR MON CADAVRE ET VOUS NE
DANSEREZ QU'AVEC LA NONNETTE DU JARDIN ALLUDING TO THE LEGEND
AND
SHE MAJESTICALLY WALKED TO AND FRO ALONG THEIR DISCONSOLATE AND
IMPATIENT LINE LIKE A LITTLE BONAPARTE IN A MOUSE COLOURED SILK GOWN
MADAME KNEW SOMETHING OF THE WORLD MADAME KNEW MUCH OF HUMAN NATURE
I
DON'T THINK THAT ANOTHER DIRECTRESS IN VILLETTE WOULD HAVE DARED TO
ADMIT A JEUNE HOMME WITHIN HER WALLS BUT MADAME KNEW THAT BY
GRANTING SUCH ADMISSION ON AN OCCASION LIKE THE PRESENT A BOLD STROKE
MIGHT BE STRUCK AND A GREAT POINT GAINED
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE PARENTS WERE MADE ACCOMPLICES TO THE DEED FOR
IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THEIR MEDIATION IT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT
SECONDLY THE
ADMISSION OF THESE RATTLESNAKES SO FASCINATING AND SO DANGEROUS
SERVED TO DRAW OUT MADAME PRECISELY IN HER STRONGEST CHARACTER THAT OF
A FIRST RATE SURVEILLANTE
THIRDLY THEIR PRESENCE FURNISHED A MOST
PIQUANT INGREDIENT TO THE ENTERTAINMENT THE PUPILS KNEW IT AND SAW
IT AND THE VIEW OF SUCH GOLDEN APPLES SHINING AFAR OFF ANIMATED THEM
WITH A SPIRIT NO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE COULD HAVE KINDLED
THE CHILDREN'S
PLEASURE SPREAD TO THE PARENTS LIFE AND MIRTH CIRCULATED QUICKLY ROUND
THE BALL ROOM THE JEUNES GENS THEMSELVES THOUGH RESTRAINED WERE
AMUSED FOR MADAME NEVER PERMITTED THEM TO FEEL DULL AND THUS MADAME
BECK'S FTE ANNUALLY ENSURED A SUCCESS UNKNOWN TO THE FTE OF ANY OTHER
DIRECTRESS IN THE LAND
I OBSERVED THAT DR
JOHN WAS AT FIRST PERMITTED TO WALK AT LARGE
THROUGH THE CLASSES THERE WAS ABOUT HIM A MANLY RESPONSIBLE LOOK
THAT REDEEMED HIS YOUTH AND HALF EXPIATED HIS BEAUTY BUT AS SOON AS
THE BALL BEGAN MADAME RAN UP TO HIM
COME WOLF COME SAID SHE LAUGHING YOU WEAR SHEEP'S CLOTHING BUT
YOU MUST QUIT THE FOLD NOTWITHSTANDING
COME I HAVE A FINE MENAGERIE
OF TWENTY HERE IN THE CARR LET ME PLACE YOU AMONGST MY COLLECTION
BUT FIRST SUFFER ME TO HAVE ONE DANCE WITH ONE PUPIL OF MY CHOICE
HAVE YOU THE FACE TO ASK SUCH A THING IT IS MADNESS IT IS IMPIETY
SORTEZ SORTEZ AU PLUS VITE
SHE DROVE HIM BEFORE HER AND SOON HAD HIM ENCLOSED WITHIN THE CORDON
GINEVRA BEING I SUPPOSE TIRED WITH DANCING SOUGHT ME OUT IN MY
RETREAT
SHE THREW HERSELF ON THE BENCH BESIDE ME AND A DEMONSTRATION
I COULD VERY WELL HAVE DISPENSED WITH CAST HER ARMS ROUND MY NECK
LUCY SNOWE LUCY SNOWE SHE CRIED IN A SOMEWHAT SOBBING VOICE HALF
HYSTERICAL
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THE MATTER I DRILY SAID
HOW DO I LOOK HOW DO I LOOK TO NIGHT SHE DEMANDED
AS USUAL SAID I PREPOSTEROUSLY VAIN
CAUSTIC CREATURE YOU NEVER HAVE A KIND WORD FOR ME BUT IN SPITE OF
YOU AND ALL OTHER ENVIOUS DETRACTORS I KNOW I AM BEAUTIFUL I FEEL
IT I SEE IT FOR THERE IS A GREAT LOOKING GLASS IN THE DRESSING ROOM
WHERE I CAN VIEW MY SHAPE FROM HEAD TO FOOT
WILL YOU GO WITH ME NOW
AND LET US TWO STAND BEFORE IT
I WILL MISS FANSHAWE YOU SHALL BE HUMOURED EVEN TO THE TOP OF YOUR
BENT
THE DRESSING ROOM WAS VERY NEAR AND WE STEPPED IN
PUTTING HER ARM
THROUGH MINE SHE DREW ME TO THE MIRROR
WITHOUT RESISTANCE
REMONSTRANCE OR REMARK I STOOD AND LET HER SELF LOVE HAVE ITS FEAST
AND TRIUMPH CURIOUS TO SEE HOW MUCH IT COULD SWALLOW WHETHER IT WAS
POSSIBLE IT COULD FEED TO SATIETY WHETHER ANY WHISPER OF CONSIDERATION
FOR OTHERS COULD PENETRATE HER HEART AND MODERATE ITS VAINGLORIOUS
EXULTATION
NOT AT ALL
SHE TURNED ME AND HERSELF ROUND SHE VIEWED US BOTH ON ALL
SIDES SHE SMILED SHE WAVED HER CURLS SHE RETOUCHED HER SASH SHE
SPREAD HER DRESS AND FINALLY LETTING GO MY ARM AND CURTSEYING WITH
MOCK RESPECT SHE SAID I WOULD NOT BE YOU FOR A KINGDOM
THE REMARK WAS TOO NAVE TO ROUSE ANGER I MERELY SAID VERY GOOD
AND WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE TO BE ME SHE INQUIRED
NOT A BAD SIXPENCE STRANGE AS IT MAY SOUND I REPLIED
YOU ARE BUT
A POOR CREATURE
YOU DON'T THINK SO IN YOUR HEART
NO FOR IN MY HEART YOU HAVE NOT THE OUTLINE OF A PLACE I ONLY
OCCASIONALLY TURN YOU OVER IN MY BRAIN
WELL BUT SAID SHE IN AN EXPOSTULATORY TONE JUST LISTEN TO THE
DIFFERENCE OF OUR POSITIONS AND THEN SEE HOW HAPPY AM I AND HOW
MISERABLE ARE YOU
GO ON I LISTEN
IN THE FIRST PLACE I AM THE DAUGHTER OF A GENTLEMAN OF FAMILY AND
THOUGH MY FATHER IS NOT RICH I HAVE EXPECTATIONS FROM AN UNCLE
THEN
I AM JUST EIGHTEEN THE FINEST AGE POSSIBLE
I HAVE HAD A CONTINENTAL
EDUCATION AND THOUGH I CAN'T SPELL I HAVE ABUNDANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
I
AM PRETTY YOU CAN'T DENY THAT I MAY HAVE AS MANY ADMIRERS AS I
CHOOSE
THIS VERY NIGHT I HAVE BEEN BREAKING THE HEARTS OF TWO
GENTLEMEN AND IT IS THE DYING LOOK I HAD FROM ONE OF THEM JUST NOW
WHICH PUTS ME IN SUCH SPIRITS
I DO SO LIKE TO WATCH THEM TURN RED AND
PALE AND SCOWL AND DART FIERY GLANCES AT EACH OTHER AND LANGUISHING
ONES AT ME
THERE IS ME HAPPY ME NOW FOR YOU POOR SOUL
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOBODY'S DAUGHTER SINCE YOU TOOK CARE OF LITTLE
CHILDREN WHEN YOU FIRST CAME TO VILLETTE YOU HAVE NO RELATIONS YOU
CAN'T CALL YOURSELF YOUNG AT TWENTY THREE YOU HAVE NO ATTRACTIVE
ACCOMPLISHMENTS NO BEAUTY
AS TO ADMIRERS YOU HARDLY KNOW WHAT THEY
ARE YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK ON THE SUBJECT YOU SIT DUMB WHEN THE OTHER
TEACHERS QUOTE THEIR CONQUESTS
I BELIEVE YOU NEVER WERE IN LOVE AND
NEVER WILL BE YOU DON'T KNOW THE FEELING AND SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR
THOUGH YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR OWN HEART BROKEN NO LIVING HEART WILL YOU
EVER BREAK
ISN'T IT ALL TRUE
A GOOD DEAL OF IT IS TRUE AS GOSPEL AND SHREWD BESIDES
THERE MUST BE
GOOD IN YOU GINEVRA TO SPEAK SO HONESTLY THAT SNAKE ZLIE ST
PIERRE COULD NOT UTTER WHAT YOU HAVE UTTERED
STILL MISS FANSHAWE
HAPLESS AS I AM ACCORDING TO YOUR SHOWING SIXPENCE I WOULD NOT GIVE
TO PURCHASE YOU BODY AND SOUL
JUST BECAUSE I AM NOT CLEVER AND THAT IS ALL YOU THINK OF
NOBODY
IN THE WORLD BUT YOU CARES FOR CLEVERNESS
ON THE CONTRARY I CONSIDER YOU ARE CLEVER IN YOUR WAY VERY SMART
INDEED
BUT YOU WERE TALKING OF BREAKING HEARTS THAT EDIFYING
AMUSEMENT INTO THE MERITS OF WHICH I DON'T QUITE ENTER PRAY ON WHOM
DOES YOUR VANITY LEAD YOU TO THINK YOU HAVE DONE EXECUTION TO NIGHT
SHE APPROACHED HER LIPS TO MY EAR ISIDORE AND ALFRED DE HAMAL ARE
BOTH HERE SHE WHISPERED
OH THEY ARE I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM
THERE'S A DEAR CREATURE YOUR CURIOSITY IS ROUSED AT LAST
FOLLOW ME
I WILL POINT THEM OUT
SHE PROUDLY LED THE WAY BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THEM WELL FROM THE
CLASSES SAID SHE TURNING MADAME KEEPS THEM TOO FAR OFF
LET US
CROSS THE GARDEN ENTER BY THE CORRIDOR AND GET CLOSE TO THEM BEHIND
WE SHALL BE SCOLDED IF WE ARE SEEN BUT NEVER MIND
FOR ONCE I DID NOT MIND
THROUGH THE GARDEN WE WENT PENETRATED INTO
THE CORRIDOR BY A QUIET PRIVATE ENTRANCE AND APPROACHING THE CARR
YET KEEPING IN THE CORRIDOR SHADE COMMANDED A NEAR VIEW OF THE BAND OF
JEUNES GENS
I BELIEVE I COULD HAVE PICKED OUT THE CONQUERING DE HAMAL EVEN
UNDIRECTED
HE WAS A STRAIGHT NOSED VERY CORRECT FEATURED LITTLE
DANDY
I SAY LITTLE DANDY THOUGH HE WAS NOT BENEATH THE MIDDLE
STANDARD IN STATURE BUT HIS LINEAMENTS WERE SMALL AND SO WERE HIS
HANDS AND FEET AND HE WAS PRETTY AND SMOOTH AND AS TRIM AS A DOLL SO
NICELY DRESSED SO NICELY CURLED SO BOOTED AND GLOVED AND CRAVATED HE
WAS CHARMING INDEED
I SAID SO
WHAT A DEAR PERSONAGE CRIED I AND
COMMENDED GINEVRA'S TASTE WARMLY AND ASKED HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT DE
HAMAL MIGHT HAVE DONE WITH THE PRECIOUS FRAGMENTS OF THAT HEART SHE HAD
BROKEN WHETHER HE KEPT THEM IN A SCENT VIAL AND CONSERVED THEM IN
OTTO OF ROSES I OBSERVED TOO WITH DEEP RAPTURE OF APPROBATION THAT
THE COLONEL'S HANDS WERE SCARCE LARGER THAN MISS FANSHAWE'S OWN AND
SUGGESTED THAT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MIGHT BE CONVENIENT AS HE COULD WEAR
HER GLOVES AT A PINCH
ON HIS DEAR CURLS I TOLD HER I DOATED AND AS
TO HIS LOW GRECIAN BROW AND EXQUISITE CLASSIC HEADPIECE I CONFESSED
I HAD NO LANGUAGE TO DO SUCH PERFECTIONS JUSTICE
AND IF HE WERE YOUR LOVER SUGGESTED THE CRUELLY EXULTANT GINEVRA
OH HEAVENS WHAT BLISS SAID I BUT DO NOT BE INHUMAN MISS
FANSHAWE TO PUT SUCH THOUGHTS INTO MY HEAD IS LIKE SHOWING POOR
OUTCAST CAIN A FAR GLIMPSE OF PARADISE
YOU LIKE HIM THEN
AS I LIKE SWEETS AND JAMS AND COMFITS AND CONSERVATORY FLOWERS
GINEVRA ADMIRED MY TASTE FOR ALL THESE THINGS WERE HER ADORATION SHE
COULD THEN READILY CREDIT THAT THEY WERE MINE TOO
NOW FOR ISIDORE I WENT ON
I OWN I FELT STILL MORE CURIOUS TO SEE
HIM THAN HIS RIVAL BUT GINEVRA WAS ABSORBED IN THE LATTER
ALFRED WAS ADMITTED HERE TO NIGHT SAID SHE THROUGH THE INFLUENCE
OF HIS AUNT MADAME LA BARONNE DE DORLODOT AND NOW HAVING SEEN HIM
CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE BEEN IN SUCH SPIRITS ALL THE EVENING
AND ACTED SO WELL AND DANCED WITH SUCH LIFE AND WHY I AM NOW HAPPY AS
A QUEEN DIEU DIEU IT WAS SUCH GOOD FUN TO GLANCE FIRST AT HIM AND
THEN AT THE OTHER AND MADDEN THEM BOTH
BUT THAT OTHER WHERE IS HE SHOW ME ISIDORE
I DON'T LIKE
WHY NOT
I AM ASHAMED OF HIM
FOR WHAT REASON
BECAUSE BECAUSE IN A WHISPER HE HAS SUCH SUCH WHISKERS
ORANGE RED THERE NOW
THE MURDER IS OUT I SUBJOINED
NEVER MIND SHOW HIM ALL THE SAME I
ENGAGE NOT TO FAINT
SHE LOOKED ROUND
JUST THEN AN ENGLISH VOICE SPOKE BEHIND HER AND ME
YOU ARE BOTH STANDING IN A DRAUGHT YOU MUST LEAVE THIS CORRIDOR
THERE IS NO DRAUGHT DR
JOHN SAID I TURNING
SHE TAKES COLD SO EASILY HE PURSUED LOOKING AT GINEVRA WITH EXTREME
KINDNESS
SHE IS DELICATE SHE MUST BE CARED FOR FETCH HER A SHAWL
PERMIT ME TO JUDGE FOR MYSELF SAID MISS FANSHAWE WITH HAUTEUR
I
WANT NO SHAWL
YOUR DRESS IS THIN YOU HAVE BEEN DANCING YOU ARE HEATED
ALWAYS PREACHING RETORTED SHE ALWAYS CODDLING AND ADMONISHING
THE ANSWER DR
JOHN WOULD HAVE GIVEN DID NOT COME THAT HIS HEART WAS
HURT BECAME EVIDENT IN HIS EYE DARKENED AND SADDENED AND PAINED HE
TURNED A LITTLE ASIDE BUT WAS PATIENT
I KNEW WHERE THERE WERE PLENTY
OF SHAWLS NEAR AT HAND I RAN AND FETCHED ONE
SHE SHALL WEAR THIS IF I HAVE STRENGTH TO MAKE HER SAID I FOLDING
IT WELL ROUND HER MUSLIN DRESS COVERING CAREFULLY HER NECK AND HER
ARMS
IS THAT ISIDORE I ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT FIERCE WHISPER
SHE PUSHED UP HER LIP SMILED AND NODDED
IS THAT ISIDORE I REPEATED GIVING HER A SHAKE I COULD HAVE GIVEN
HER A DOZEN
C'EST LUI MME SAID SHE
HOW COARSE HE IS COMPARED WITH THE
COLONEL COUNT AND THEN OH CIEL THE WHISKERS
DR
JOHN NOW PASSED ON

THE DOLL THE PUPPET THE MANIKIN THE
POOR INFERIOR CREATURE A MERE LACKEY FOR DR
JOHN HIS VALET HIS
FOOT BOY IS IT POSSIBLE THAT FINE GENEROUS GENTLEMAN HANDSOME AS A
VISION OFFERS YOU HIS HONOURABLE HAND AND GALLANT HEART AND PROMISES
TO PROTECT YOUR FLIMSY PERSON AND FECKLESS MIND THROUGH THE STORMS AND
STRUGGLES OF LIFE AND YOU HANG BACK YOU SCORN YOU STING YOU TORTURE

BUT YOU TRIFLE WITH HIS HEART TO MAKE HIM MORE SURELY YOURS
BAH HOW YOU RUN ON I DON'T UNDERSTAND HALF YOU HAVE SAID
I HAD GOT HER OUT INTO THE GARDEN ERE THIS
I NOW SET HER DOWN ON A
SEAT AND TOLD HER SHE SHOULD NOT STIR TILL SHE HAD AVOWED WHICH SHE
MEANT IN THE END TO ACCEPT THE MAN OR THE MONKEY
HIM YOU CALL THE MAN SAID SHE IS BOURGEOIS SANDY HAIRED AND
ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF JOHN CELA SUFFIT JE N'EN VEUX PAS
COLONEL DE
HAMAL IS A GENTLEMAN OF EXCELLENT CONNECTIONS PERFECT MANNERS SWEET
APPEARANCE WITH PALE INTERESTING FACE AND HAIR AND EYES LIKE AN
ITALIAN
THEN TOO HE IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL COMPANY POSSIBLE A MAN
QUITE IN MY WAY NOT SENSIBLE AND SERIOUS LIKE THE OTHER BUT ONE WITH
WHOM I CAN TALK ON EQUAL TERMS WHO DOES NOT PLAGUE AND BORE AND
HARASS ME WITH DEPTHS AND HEIGHTS AND PASSIONS AND TALENTS FOR WHICH
I HAVE NO TASTE
THERE NOW
DON'T HOLD ME SO FAST
I SLACKENED MY GRASP AND SHE DARTED OFF
I DID NOT CARE TO PURSUE HER
SOMEHOW I COULD NOT AVOID RETURNING ONCE MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
CORRIDOR TO GET ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF DR
JOHN BUT I MET HIM ON THE
GARDEN STEPS STANDING WHERE THE LIGHT FROM A WINDOW FELL BROAD
HIS
WELL PROPORTIONED FIGURE WAS NOT TO BE MISTAKEN FOR I DOUBT WHETHER
THERE WAS ANOTHER IN THAT ASSEMBLAGE HIS EQUAL
HE CARRIED HIS HAT IN
HIS HAND HIS UNCOVERED HEAD HIS FACE AND FINE BROW WERE MOST HANDSOME
AND MANLY
HIS FEATURES WERE NOT DELICATE NOT SLIGHT LIKE THOSE OF A
WOMAN NOR WERE THEY COLD FRIVOLOUS AND FEEBLE THOUGH WELL CUT THEY
WERE NOT SO CHISELLED SO FRITTERED AWAY AS TO LOSE IN EXPRESSION OR
SIGNIFICANCE WHAT THEY GAINED IN UNMEANING SYMMETRY
MUCH FEELING SPOKE
IN THEM AT TIMES AND MORE SAT SILENT IN HIS EYE
SUCH AT LEAST WERE MY
THOUGHTS OF HIM TO ME HE SEEMED ALL THIS
AN INEXPRESSIBLE SENSE OF
WONDER OCCUPIED ME AS I LOOKED AT THIS MAN AND REFLECTED THAT HE
COULD NOT BE SLIGHTED
IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION TO APPROACH OR ADDRESS HIM IN THE GARDEN OUR
TERMS OF ACQUAINTANCE NOT WARRANTING SUCH A STEP I HAD ONLY MEANT TO
VIEW HIM IN THE CROWD MYSELF UNSEEN COMING UPON HIM THUS ALONE I
WITHDREW
BUT HE WAS LOOKING OUT FOR ME OR RATHER FOR HER WHO HAD BEEN
WITH ME THEREFORE HE DESCENDED THE STEPS AND FOLLOWED ME DOWN THE
ALLEY
YOU KNOW MISS FANSHAWE I HAVE OFTEN WISHED TO ASK WHETHER YOU KNEW
HER SAID HE
YES I KNOW HER
INTIMATELY
QUITE AS INTIMATELY AS I WISH
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER NOW
AM I HER KEEPER I FELT INCLINED TO ASK BUT I SIMPLY ANSWERED I
HAVE SHAKEN HER WELL AND WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HER BETTER BUT SHE ESCAPED
OUT OF MY HANDS AND RAN AWAY
WOULD YOU FAVOUR ME HE ASKED BY WATCHING OVER HER THIS ONE
EVENING AND OBSERVING THAT SHE DOES NOTHING IMPRUDENT DOES NOT FOR
INSTANCE RUN OUT INTO THE NIGHT AIR IMMEDIATELY AFTER DANCING
I MAY PERHAPS LOOK AFTER HER A LITTLE SINCE YOU WISH IT BUT SHE
LIKES HER OWN WAY TOO WELL TO SUBMIT READILY TO CONTROL
SHE IS SO YOUNG SO THOROUGHLY ARTLESS SAID HE
TO ME SHE IS AN ENIGMA I RESPONDED
IS SHE HE ASKED MUCH INTERESTED
HOW
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY HOW DIFFICULT AT LEAST TO TELL YOU
HOW
AND WHY ME
I WONDER SHE IS NOT BETTER PLEASED THAT YOU ARE SO MUCH HER FRIEND
BUT SHE HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA HOW MUCH I AM HER FRIEND
THAT IS
PRECISELY THE POINT I CANNOT TEACH HER
MAY I INQUIRE DID SHE EVER
SPEAK OF ME TO YOU
UNDER THE NAME OF 'ISIDORE' SHE HAS TALKED ABOUT YOU OFTEN BUT I MUST
ADD THAT IT IS ONLY WITHIN THE LAST TEN MINUTES I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT
YOU AND 'ISIDORE' ARE IDENTICAL
IT IS ONLY DR
JOHN WITHIN THAT
BRIEF SPACE OF TIME I HAVE LEARNED THAT GINEVRA FANSHAWE IS THE PERSON
UNDER THIS ROOF IN WHOM YOU HAVE LONG BEEN INTERESTED THAT SHE IS THE
MAGNET WHICH ATTRACTS YOU TO THE RUE FOSSETTE THAT FOR HER SAKE YOU
VENTURE INTO THIS GARDEN AND SEEK OUT CASKETS DROPPED BY RIVALS
YOU KNOW ALL
I KNOW SO MUCH
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO MEET HER IN SOCIETY
MRS
CHOLMONDELEY HER FRIEND IS AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE THUS I SEE
HER EVERY SUNDAY
BUT YOU OBSERVED THAT UNDER THE NAME OF 'ISIDORE' SHE
OFTEN SPOKE OF ME MAY I WITHOUT INVITING YOU TO A BREACH OF
CONFIDENCE INQUIRE WHAT WAS THE TONE WHAT THE FEELING OF HER REMARKS
I FEEL SOMEWHAT ANXIOUS TO KNOW BEING A LITTLE TORMENTED WITH
UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW I STAND WITH HER
OH SHE VARIES SHE SHIFTS AND CHANGES LIKE THE WIND
STILL YOU CAN GATHER SOME GENERAL IDEA
I CAN THOUGHT I BUT IT WOULD NOT DO TO COMMUNICATE THAT GENERAL
IDEA TO YOU
BESIDES IF I SAID SHE DID NOT LOVE YOU I KNOW YOU WOULD
NOT BELIEVE ME
YOU ARE SILENT HE PURSUED
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NO GOOD NEWS TO
IMPART
NO MATTER
IF SHE FEELS FOR ME POSITIVE COLDNESS AND AVERSION
IT IS A SIGN I DO NOT DESERVE HER
DO YOU DOUBT YOURSELF DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF THE INFERIOR OF
COLONEL DE HAMAL
I LOVE MISS FANSHAWE FAR MORE THAN DE HAMAL LOVES ANY HUMAN BEING AND
WOULD CARE FOR AND GUARD HER BETTER THAN HE
RESPECTING DE HAMAL I
FEAR SHE IS UNDER AN ILLUSION THE MAN'S CHARACTER IS KNOWN TO ME ALL
HIS ANTECEDENTS ALL HIS SCRAPES
HE IS NOT WORTHY OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL
YOUNG FRIEND
MY 'BEAUTIFUL YOUNG FRIEND' OUGHT TO KNOW THAT AND TO KNOW OR FEEL
WHO IS WORTHY OF HER SAID I
IF HER BEAUTY OR HER BRAINS WILL NOT
SERVE HER SO FAR SHE MERITS THE SHARP LESSON OF EXPERIENCE
ARE YOU NOT A LITTLE SEVERE
I AM EXCESSIVELY SEVERE MORE SEVERE THAN I CHOOSE TO SHOW YOU
YOU
SHOULD HEAR THE STRICTURES WITH WHICH I FAVOUR MY 'BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
FRIEND ONLY THAT YOU WOULD BE UNUTTERABLY SHOCKED AT MY WANT OF
TENDER CONSIDERATENESS FOR HER DELICATE NATURE
SHE IS SO LOVELY ONE CANNOT BUT BE LOVING TOWARDS HER
YOU EVERY
WOMAN OLDER THAN HERSELF MUST FEEL FOR SUCH A SIMPLE INNOCENT
GIRLISH FAIRY A SORT OF MOTHERLY OR ELDER SISTERLY FONDNESS
GRACEFUL
ANGEL DOES NOT YOUR HEART YEARN TOWARDS HER WHEN SHE POURS INTO YOUR
EAR HER PURE CHILDLIKE CONFIDENCES HOW YOU ARE PRIVILEGED AND HE
SIGHED
I CUT SHORT THESE CONFIDENCES SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY NOW AND THEN SAID I
BUT EXCUSE ME DR
JOHN MAY I CHANGE THE THEME FOR ONE INSTANT WHAT
A GOD LIKE PERSON IS THAT DE HAMAL WHAT A NOSE ON HIS FACE PERFECT
MODEL ONE IN PUTTY OR CLAY YOU COULD NOT MAKE A BETTER OR STRAIGHTER
OR NEATER AND THEN SUCH CLASSIC LIPS AND CHIN AND HIS
BEARING SUBLIME
DE HAMAL IS AN UNUTTERABLE PUPPY BESIDES BEING A VERY WHITE LIVERED
HERO
YOU DR
JOHN AND EVERY MAN OF A LESS REFINED MOULD THAN HE MUST
FEEL FOR HIM A SORT OF ADMIRING AFFECTION SUCH AS MARS AND THE COARSER
DEITIES MAY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BORNE THE YOUNG GRACEFUL APOLLO
AN UNPRINCIPLED GAMBLING LITTLE JACKANAPES SAID DR
JOHN CURTLY
WHOM WITH ONE HAND I COULD LIFT UP BY THE WAISTBAND ANY DAY AND LAY
LOW IN THE KENNEL IF I LIKED
THE SWEET SERAPH SAID I
WHAT A CRUEL IDEA ARE YOU NOT A LITTLE
SEVERE DR
JOHN
AND NOW I PAUSED
FOR THE SECOND TIME THAT NIGHT I WAS GOING BEYOND
MYSELF VENTURING OUT OF WHAT I LOOKED ON AS MY NATURAL
HABITS SPEAKING IN AN UNPREMEDITATED IMPULSIVE STRAIN WHICH STARTLED
ME STRANGELY WHEN I HALTED TO REFLECT
ON RISING THAT MORNING HAD I
ANTICIPATED THAT BEFORE NIGHT I SHOULD HAVE ACTED THE PART OF A GAY
LOVER IN A VAUDEVILLE AND AN HOUR AFTER FRANKLY DISCUSSED WITH DR
JOHN THE QUESTION OF HIS HAPLESS SUIT AND RALLIED HIM ON HIS
ILLUSIONS I HAD NO MORE PRESAGED SUCH FEATS THAN I HAD LOOKED FORWARD
TO AN ASCENT IN A BALLOON OR A VOYAGE TO CAPE HORN
THE DOCTOR AND I HAVING PACED DOWN THE WALK WERE NOW RETURNING THE
REFLEX FROM THE WINDOW AGAIN LIT HIS FACE HE SMILED BUT HIS EYE WAS
MELANCHOLY
HOW I WISHED THAT HE COULD FEEL HEART'S EASE HOW I GRIEVED
THAT HE BROODED OVER PAIN AND PAIN FROM SUCH A CAUSE HE WITH HIS
GREAT ADVANTAGES HE TO LOVE IN VAIN I DID NOT THEN KNOW THAT THE
PENSIVENESS OF REVERSE IS THE BEST PHASE FOR SOME MINDS NOR DID I
REFLECT THAT SOME HERBS THOUGH SCENTLESS WHEN ENTIRE YIELD FRAGRANCE
WHEN THEY'RE BRUISED
DO NOT BE SORROWFUL DO NOT GRIEVE I BROKE OUT
IF THERE IS IN
GINEVRA ONE SPARK OF WORTHINESS OF YOUR AFFECTION SHE WILL SHE MUST
FEEL DEVOTION IN RETURN
BE CHEERFUL BE HOPEFUL DR
JOHN
WHO SHOULD
HOPE IF NOT YOU
IN RETURN FOR THIS SPEECH I GOT WHAT IT MUST BE SUPPOSED I
DESERVED A LOOK OF SURPRISE I THOUGHT ALSO OF SOME DISAPPROBATION
WE
PARTED AND I WENT INTO THE HOUSE VERY CHILL
THE CLOCKS STRUCK AND THE
BELLS TOLLED MIDNIGHT PEOPLE WERE LEAVING FAST THE FTE WAS OVER THE
LAMPS WERE FADING
IN ANOTHER HOUR ALL THE DWELLING HOUSE AND ALL THE
PENSIONNAT WERE DARK AND HUSHED
I TOO WAS IN BED BUT NOT ASLEEP
TO
ME IT WAS NOT EASY TO SLEEP AFTER A DAY OF SUCH EXCITEMENT
CHAPTER XV
THE LONG VACATION
FOLLOWING MADAME BECK'S FTE WITH ITS THREE PRECEDING WEEKS OF
RELAXATION ITS BRIEF TWELVE HOURS' BURST OF HILARITY AND DISSIPATION
AND ITS ONE SUBSEQUENT DAY OF UTTER LANGUOR CAME A PERIOD OF REACTION
TWO MONTHS OF REAL APPLICATION OF CLOSE HARD STUDY
THESE TWO MONTHS
BEING THE LAST OF THE ANNE SCOLAIRE WERE INDEED THE ONLY GENUINE
WORKING MONTHS IN THE YEAR
TO THEM WAS PROCRASTINATED INTO THEM
CONCENTRATED ALIKE BY PROFESSORS MISTRESSES AND PUPILS THE MAIN
BURDEN OF PREPARATION FOR THE EXAMINATIONS PRECEDING THE DISTRIBUTION
OF PRIZES
CANDIDATES FOR REWARDS HAD THEN TO WORK IN GOOD EARNEST
MASTERS AND TEACHERS HAD TO SET THEIR SHOULDERS TO THE WHEEL TO URGE
ON THE BACKWARD AND DILIGENTLY AID AND TRAIN THE MORE PROMISING
A
SHOWY DEMONSTRATION A TELLING EXHIBITION MUST BE GOT UP FOR PUBLIC
VIEW AND ALL MEANS WERE FAIR TO THIS END
I SCARCELY NOTED HOW THE OTHER TEACHERS WENT TO WORK I HAD MY OWN
BUSINESS TO MIND AND MY TASK WAS NOT THE LEAST ONEROUS BEING TO
IMBUE SOME NINETY SETS OF BRAINS WITH A DUE TINCTURE OF WHAT THEY
CONSIDERED A MOST COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT SCIENCE THAT OF THE
ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND TO DRILL NINETY TONGUES IN WHAT FOR THEM WAS AN
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE PRONUNCIATION THE LISPING AND HISSING DENTALS OF THE
ISLES
THE EXAMINATION DAY ARRIVED
AWFUL DAY PREPARED FOR WITH ANXIOUS CARE
DRESSED FOR WITH SILENT DESPATCH NOTHING VAPOROUS OR FLUTTERING
NOW NO WHITE GAUZE OR AZURE STREAMERS THE GRAVE CLOSE COMPACT WAS
THE ORDER OF THE TOILETTE
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I WAS THIS DAY
ESPECIALLY DOOMED THE MAIN BURDEN AND TRIAL FALLING ON ME ALONE OF ALL
THE FEMALE TEACHERS
THE OTHERS WERE NOT EXPECTED TO EXAMINE IN THE
STUDIES THEY TAUGHT THE PROFESSOR OF LITERATURE M
PAUL TAKING UPON
HIMSELF THIS DUTY
HE THIS SCHOOL AUTOCRAT GATHERED ALL AND SUNDRY
REINS INTO THE HOLLOW OF HIS ONE HAND HE IREFULLY REJECTED ANY
COLLEAGUE HE WOULD NOT HAVE HELP
MADAME HERSELF WHO EVIDENTLY RATHER
WISHED TO UNDERTAKE THE EXAMINATION IN GEOGRAPHY HER FAVOURITE STUDY
WHICH SHE TAUGHT WELL WAS FORCED TO SUCCUMB AND BE SUBORDINATE TO HER
DESPOTIC KINSMAN'S DIRECTION
THE WHOLE STAFF OF INSTRUCTORS MALE AND
FEMALE HE SET ASIDE AND STOOD ON THE EXAMINER'S ESTRADE ALONE
IT
IRKED HIM THAT HE WAS FORCED TO MAKE ONE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE
HE
COULD NOT MANAGE ENGLISH HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE THAT BRANCH OF
EDUCATION IN THE ENGLISH TEACHER'S HANDS WHICH HE DID NOT WITHOUT A
FLASH OF NAVE JEALOUSY
A CONSTANT CRUSADE AGAINST THE AMOUR PROPRE OF EVERY HUMAN BEING BUT
HIMSELF WAS THE CROTCHET OF THIS ABLE BUT FIERY AND GRASPING LITTLE
MAN
HE HAD A STRONG RELISH FOR PUBLIC REPRESENTATION IN HIS OWN
PERSON BUT AN EXTREME ABHORRENCE OF THE LIKE DISPLAY IN ANY OTHER
HE
QUELLED HE KEPT DOWN WHEN HE COULD AND WHEN HE COULD NOT HE FUMED
LIKE A BOTTLED STORM
ON THE EVENING PRECEDING THE EXAMINATION DAY I WAS WALKING IN THE
GARDEN AS WERE THE OTHER TEACHERS AND ALL THE BOARDERS
M
EMANUEL
JOINED ME IN THE ALLE DFENDUE HIS CIGAR WAS AT HIS LIPS HIS
PALETT A MOST CHARACTERISTIC GARMENT OF NO PARTICULAR SHAPE HUNG
DARK AND MENACING THE TASSEL OF HIS BONNET GREC STERNLY SHADOWED HIS
LEFT TEMPLE HIS BLACK WHISKERS CURLED LIKE THOSE OF A WRATHFUL CAT
HIS BLUE EYE HAD A CLOUD IN ITS GLITTER
AINSI HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY FRONTING AND ARRESTING ME VOUS ALLEZ
TRNER COMME UNE REINE DEMAIN TRNER MES CTS SANS DOUTE VOUS
SAVOUREZ D'AVANCE LES DLICES DE L'AUTORIT
JE CROIS VOIR EN JE NE
SAIS QUOI DE RAYONNANTE PETITE AMBITIEUSE
NOW THE FACT WAS HE HAPPENED TO BE ENTIRELY MISTAKEN
I DID NOT COULD
NOT ESTIMATE THE ADMIRATION OR THE GOOD OPINION OF TOMORROW'S AUDIENCE
AT THE SAME RATE HE DID
HAD THAT AUDIENCE NUMBERED AS MANY PERSONAL
FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCE FOR ME AS FOR HIM I KNOW NOT HOW IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN I SPEAK OF THE CASE AS IT STOOD
ON ME SCHOOL TRIUMPHS SHED
BUT A COLD LUSTRE
I HAD WONDERED AND I WONDERED NOW HOW IT WAS THAT
FOR HIM THEY SEEMED TO SHINE AS WITH HEARTH WARMTH AND HEARTH GLOW
HE CARED FOR THEM PERHAPS TOO MUCH I PROBABLY TOO LITTLE
HOWEVER I HAD MY OWN FANCIES AS WELL AS HE
I LIKED FOR INSTANCE TO
SEE M
EMANUEL JEALOUS IT LIT UP HIS NATURE AND WOKE HIS SPIRIT IT
THREW ALL SORTS OF QUEER LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OVER HIS DUN FACE AND INTO
HIS VIOLET AZURE EYES HE USED TO SAY THAT HIS BLACK HAIR AND BLUE EYES
WERE UNE DE SES BEAUTS
THERE WAS A RELISH IN HIS ANGER IT WAS
ARTLESS EARNEST QUITE UNREASONABLE BUT NEVER HYPOCRITICAL
I UTTERED
NO DISCLAIMER THEN OF THE COMPLACENCY HE ATTRIBUTED TO ME I MERELY
ASKED WHERE THE ENGLISH EXAMINATION CAME IN WHETHER AT THE
COMMENCEMENT OR CLOSE OF THE DAY
I HESITATE SAID HE WHETHER AT THE VERY BEGINNING BEFORE MANY
PERSONS ARE COME AND WHEN YOUR ASPIRING NATURE WILL NOT BE GRATIFIED
BY A LARGE AUDIENCE OR QUITE AT THE CLOSE WHEN EVERYBODY IS TIRED
AND ONLY A JADED AND WORN OUT ATTENTION WILL BE AT YOUR SERVICE
QUE VOUS TES DUR MONSIEUR I SAID AFFECTING DEJECTION
ONE OUGHT TO BE 'DUR' WITH YOU
YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE BEINGS WHO MUST
BE KEPT DOWN
I KNOW YOU I KNOW YOU OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE SEE
YOU PASS AND THINK THAT A COLOURLESS SHADOW HAS GONE BY
AS FOR ME I
SCRUTINIZED YOUR FACE ONCE AND IT SUFFICED
YOU ARE SATISFIED THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ME
WITHOUT ANSWERING DIRECTLY HE WENT ON WERE YOU NOT GRATIFIED WHEN
YOU SUCCEEDED IN THAT VAUDEVILLE I WATCHED YOU AND SAW A PASSIONATE
ARDOUR FOR TRIUMPH IN YOUR PHYSIOGNOMY
WHAT FIRE SHOT INTO THE GLANCE
NOT MERE LIGHT BUT FLAME JE ME TIENS POUR AVERTI
WHAT FEELING I HAD ON THAT OCCASION MONSIEUR AND PARDON ME IF I
SAY YOU IMMENSELY EXAGGERATE BOTH ITS QUALITY AND QUANTITY WAS QUITE
ABSTRACT
I DID NOT CARE FOR THE VAUDEVILLE
I HATED THE PART YOU
ASSIGNED ME
I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST SYMPATHY WITH THE AUDIENCE BELOW
THE STAGE
THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE DOUBTLESS BUT DO I KNOW THEM ARE
THEY ANYTHING TO ME CAN I CARE FOR BEING BROUGHT BEFORE THEIR VIEW
AGAIN TO MORROW WILL THE EXAMINATION BE ANYTHING BUT A TASK TO ME A
TASK I WISH WELL OVER
SHALL I TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR HANDS
WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU DO NOT FEAR FAILURE
BUT I SHOULD FAIL
I ONLY KNOW THREE PHRASES OF ENGLISH AND A FEW
WORDS PAR EXEMPLE DE SONN DE MONE DE STARES EST CE BIEN DIT MY
OPINION IS THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GIVE UP THE THING ALTOGETHER TO
HAVE NO ENGLISH EXAMINATION EH
IF MADAME CONSENTS I CONSENT
HEARTILY
VERY HEARTILY
HE SMOKED HIS CIGAR IN SILENCE
HE TURNED SUDDENLY
DONNEZ MOI LA MAIN SAID HE AND THE SPITE AND JEALOUSY MELTED OUT OF
HIS FACE AND A GENEROUS KINDLINESS SHONE THERE INSTEAD
COME WE WILL NOT BE RIVALS WE WILL BE FRIENDS HE PURSUED
THE
EXAMINATION SHALL TAKE PLACE AND I WILL CHOOSE A GOOD MOMENT AND
INSTEAD OF VEXING AND HINDERING AS I FELT HALF INCLINED TEN MINUTES
AGO FOR I HAVE MY MALEVOLENT MOODS I ALWAYS HAD FROM CHILDHOOD I
WILL AID YOU SINCERELY
AFTER ALL YOU ARE SOLITARY AND A STRANGER AND
HAVE YOUR WAY TO MAKE AND YOUR BREAD TO EARN IT MAY BE WELL THAT YOU
SHOULD BECOME KNOWN
WE WILL BE FRIENDS DO YOU AGREE
OUT OF MY HEART MONSIEUR
I AM GLAD OF A FRIEND
I LIKE THAT BETTER
THAN A TRIUMPH
PAUVRETTE SAID HE AND TURNED AWAY AND LEFT THE ALLEY
THE EXAMINATION PASSED OVER WELL M
PAUL WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD AND
DID HIS BEST TO MAKE MY PART EASY
THE NEXT DAY CAME THE DISTRIBUTION
OF PRIZES THAT ALSO PASSED THE SCHOOL BROKE UP THE PUPILS WENT HOME
AND NOW BEGAN THE LONG VACATION
THAT VACATION SHALL I EVER FORGET IT I THINK NOT
MADAME BECK WENT
THE FIRST DAY OF THE HOLIDAYS TO JOIN HER CHILDREN AT THE SEA SIDE
ALL THE THREE TEACHERS HAD PARENTS OR FRIENDS WITH WHOM THEY TOOK
REFUGE EVERY PROFESSOR QUITTED THE CITY SOME WENT TO PARIS SOME TO
BOUE MARINE M
PAUL SET FORTH ON A PILGRIMAGE TO ROME THE HOUSE WAS
LEFT QUITE EMPTY BUT FOR ME A SERVANT AND A POOR DEFORMED AND
IMBECILE PUPIL A SORT OF CRTIN WHOM HER STEPMOTHER IN A DISTANT
PROVINCE WOULD NOT ALLOW TO RETURN HOME
MY HEART ALMOST DIED WITHIN ME MISERABLE LONGINGS STRAINED ITS CHORDS
HOW LONG WERE THE SEPTEMBER DAYS HOW SILENT HOW LIFELESS HOW VAST
AND VOID SEEMED THE DESOLATE PREMISES HOW GLOOMY THE FORSAKEN
GARDEN GREY NOW WITH THE DUST OF A TOWN SUMMER DEPARTED
LOOKING
FORWARD AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THOSE EIGHT WEEKS I HARDLY KNEW HOW I
WAS TO LIVE TO THE END
MY SPIRITS HAD LONG BEEN GRADUALLY SINKING NOW
THAT THE PROP OF EMPLOYMENT WAS WITHDRAWN THEY WENT DOWN FAST
EVEN TO
LOOK FORWARD WAS NOT TO HOPE THE DUMB FUTURE SPOKE NO COMFORT OFFERED
NO PROMISE GAVE NO INDUCEMENT TO BEAR PRESENT EVIL IN RELIANCE ON
FUTURE GOOD
A SORROWFUL INDIFFERENCE TO EXISTENCE OFTEN PRESSED ON
ME A DESPAIRING RESIGNATION TO REACH BETIMES THE END OF ALL THINGS
EARTHLY
ALAS WHEN I HAD FULL LEISURE TO LOOK ON LIFE AS LIFE MUST BE
LOOKED ON BY SUCH AS ME I FOUND IT BUT A HOPELESS DESERT TAWNY SANDS
WITH NO GREEN FIELDS NO PALM TREE NO WELL IN VIEW
THE HOPES WHICH
ARE DEAR TO YOUTH WHICH BEAR IT UP AND LEAD IT ON I KNEW NOT AND
DARED NOT KNOW
IF THEY KNOCKED AT MY HEART SOMETIMES AN INHOSPITABLE
BAR TO ADMISSION MUST BE INWARDLY DRAWN
WHEN THEY TURNED AWAY THUS
REJECTED TEARS SAD ENOUGH SOMETIMES FLOWED BUT IT COULD NOT BE
HELPED I DARED NOT GIVE SUCH GUESTS LODGING
SO MORTALLY DID I FEAR
THE SIN AND WEAKNESS OF PRESUMPTION
RELIGIOUS READER YOU WILL PREACH TO ME A LONG SERMON ABOUT WHAT I HAVE
JUST WRITTEN AND SO WILL YOU MORALIST AND YOU STERN SAGE YOU
STOIC WILL FROWN YOU CYNIC SNEER YOU EPICURE LAUGH
WELL EACH
AND ALL TAKE IT YOUR OWN WAY
I ACCEPT THE SERMON FROWN SNEER AND
LAUGH PERHAPS YOU ARE ALL RIGHT AND PERHAPS CIRCUMSTANCED LIKE ME
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE ME WRONG
THE FIRST MONTH WAS INDEED A
LONG BLACK HEAVY MONTH TO ME
THE CRTIN DID NOT SEEM UNHAPPY
I DID MY BEST TO FEED HER WELL AND
KEEP HER WARM AND SHE ONLY ASKED FOOD AND SUNSHINE OR WHEN THAT
LACKED FIRE
HER WEAK FACULTIES APPROVED OF INERTION HER BRAIN HER
EYES HER EARS HER HEART SLEPT CONTENT THEY COULD NOT WAKE TO WORK
SO LETHARGY WAS THEIR PARADISE
THREE WEEKS OF THAT VACATION WERE HOT FAIR AND DRY BUT THE FOURTH
AND FIFTH WERE TEMPESTUOUS AND WET
I DO NOT KNOW WHY THAT CHANGE IN
THE ATMOSPHERE MADE A CRUEL IMPRESSION ON ME WHY THE RAGING STORM AND
BEATING RAIN CRUSHED ME WITH A DEADLIER PARALYSIS THAN I HAD
EXPERIENCED WHILE THE AIR HAD REMAINED SERENE BUT SO IT WAS AND MY
NERVOUS SYSTEM COULD HARDLY SUPPORT WHAT IT HAD FOR MANY DAYS AND
NIGHTS TO UNDERGO IN THAT HUGE EMPTY HOUSE
HOW I USED TO PRAY TO
HEAVEN FOR CONSOLATION AND SUPPORT WITH WHAT DREAD FORCE THE
CONVICTION WOULD GRASP ME THAT FATE WAS MY PERMANENT FOE NEVER TO BE
CONCILIATED
I DID NOT IN MY HEART ARRAIGN THE MERCY OR JUSTICE OF
GOD FOR THIS I CONCLUDED IT TO BE A PART OF HIS GREAT PLAN THAT SOME
MUST DEEPLY SUFFER WHILE THEY LIVE AND I THRILLED IN THE CERTAINTY
THAT OF THIS NUMBER I WAS ONE
IT WAS SOME RELIEF WHEN AN AUNT OF THE CRTIN A KIND OLD WOMAN CAME
ONE DAY AND TOOK AWAY MY STRANGE DEFORMED COMPANION
THE HAPLESS
CREATURE HAD BEEN AT TIMES A HEAVY CHARGE I COULD NOT TAKE HER OUT
BEYOND THE GARDEN AND I COULD NOT LEAVE HER A MINUTE ALONE FOR HER
POOR MIND LIKE HER BODY WAS WARPED ITS PROPENSITY WAS TO EVIL
A
VAGUE BENT TO MISCHIEF AN AIMLESS MALEVOLENCE MADE CONSTANT VIGILANCE
INDISPENSABLE
AS SHE VERY RARELY SPOKE AND WOULD SIT FOR HOURS
TOGETHER MOPING AND MOWING AND DISTORTING HER FEATURES WITH
INDESCRIBABLE GRIMACES IT WAS MORE LIKE BEING PRISONED WITH SOME
STRANGE TAMELESS ANIMAL THAN ASSOCIATING WITH A HUMAN BEING
THEN
THERE WERE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS TO BE RENDERED WHICH REQUIRED THE NERVE
OF A HOSPITAL NURSE MY RESOLUTION WAS SO TRIED IT SOMETIMES FELL
DEAD SICK
THESE DUTIES SHOULD NOT HAVE FALLEN ON ME A SERVANT NOW
ABSENT HAD RENDERED THEM HITHERTO AND IN THE HURRY OF HOLIDAY
DEPARTURE NO SUBSTITUTE TO FILL THIS OFFICE HAD BEEN PROVIDED
THIS
TAX AND TRIAL WERE BY NO MEANS THE LEAST I HAVE KNOWN IN LIFE
STILL
MENIAL AND DISTASTEFUL AS THEY WERE MY MENTAL PAIN WAS FAR MORE
WASTING AND WEARING
ATTENDANCE ON THE CRTIN DEPRIVED ME OFTEN OF THE
POWER AND INCLINATION TO SWALLOW A MEAL AND SENT ME FAINT TO THE FRESH
AIR AND THE WELL OR FOUNTAIN IN THE COURT BUT THIS DUTY NEVER WRUNG
MY HEART OR BRIMMED MY EYES OR SCALDED MY CHEEK WITH TEARS HOT AS
MOLTEN METAL
THE CRTIN BEING GONE I WAS FREE TO WALK OUT
AT FIRST I LACKED
COURAGE TO VENTURE VERY FAR FROM THE RUE FOSSETTE BUT BY DEGREES I
SOUGHT THE CITY GATES AND PASSED THEM AND THEN WENT WANDERING AWAY
FAR ALONG CHAUSSES THROUGH FIELDS BEYOND CEMETERIES CATHOLIC AND
PROTESTANT BEYOND FARMSTEADS TO LANES AND LITTLE WOODS AND I KNOW
NOT WHERE
A GOAD THRUST ME ON A FEVER FORBADE ME TO REST A WANT OF
COMPANIONSHIP MAINTAINED IN MY SOUL THE CRAVINGS OF A MOST DEADLY
FAMINE
I OFTEN WALKED ALL DAY THROUGH THE BURNING NOON AND THE ARID
AFTERNOON AND THE DUSK EVENING AND CAME BACK WITH MOONRISE
WHILE WANDERING IN SOLITUDE I WOULD SOMETIMES PICTURE THE PRESENT
PROBABLE POSITION OF OTHERS MY ACQUAINTANCE
THERE WAS MADAME BECK AT
A CHEERFUL WATERING PLACE WITH HER CHILDREN HER MOTHER AND A WHOLE
TROOP OF FRIENDS WHO HAD SOUGHT THE SAME SCENE OF RELAXATION
ZLIE ST
PIERRE WAS AT PARIS WITH HER RELATIVES THE OTHER TEACHERS WERE AT
THEIR HOMES
THERE WAS GINEVRA FANSHAWE WHOM CERTAIN OF HER
CONNECTIONS HAD CARRIED ON A PLEASANT TOUR SOUTHWARD
GINEVRA SEEMED TO
ME THE HAPPIEST
SHE WAS ON THE ROUTE OF BEAUTIFUL SCENERY THESE
SEPTEMBER SUNS SHONE FOR HER ON FERTILE PLAINS WHERE HARVEST AND
VINTAGE MATURED UNDER THEIR MELLOW BEAM
THESE GOLD AND CRYSTAL MOONS
ROSE ON HER VISION OVER BLUE HORIZONS WAVED IN MOUNTED LINES
BUT ALL THIS WAS NOTHING I TOO FELT THOSE AUTUMN SUNS AND SAW THOSE
HARVEST MOONS AND I ALMOST WISHED TO BE COVERED IN WITH EARTH AND
TURF DEEP OUT OF THEIR INFLUENCE FOR I COULD NOT LIVE IN THEIR LIGHT
NOR MAKE THEM COMRADES NOR YIELD THEM AFFECTION
BUT GINEVRA HAD A
KIND OF SPIRIT WITH HER EMPOWERED TO GIVE CONSTANT STRENGTH AND
COMFORT TO GLADDEN DAYLIGHT AND EMBALM DARKNESS THE BEST OF THE GOOD
GENII THAT GUARD HUMANITY CURTAINED HER WITH HIS WINGS AND CANOPIED
HER HEAD WITH HIS BENDING FORM
BY TRUE LOVE WAS GINEVRA FOLLOWED
NEVER COULD SHE BE ALONE
WAS SHE INSENSIBLE TO THIS PRESENCE IT
SEEMED TO ME IMPOSSIBLE I COULD NOT REALIZE SUCH DEADNESS
I IMAGINED
HER GRATEFUL IN SECRET LOVING NOW WITH RESERVE BUT PURPOSING ONE DAY
TO SHOW HOW MUCH SHE LOVED I PICTURED HER FAITHFUL HERO HALF CONSCIOUS
OF HER COY FONDNESS AND COMFORTED BY THAT CONSCIOUSNESS I CONCEIVED
AN ELECTRIC CHORD OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN THEM A FINE CHAIN OF MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING SUSTAINING UNION THROUGH A SEPARATION OF A HUNDRED
LEAGUES CARRYING ACROSS MOUND AND HOLLOW COMMUNICATION BY PRAYER AND
WISH
GINEVRA GRADUALLY BECAME WITH ME A SORT OF HEROINE
ONE DAY
PERCEIVING THIS GROWING ILLUSION I SAID I REALLY BELIEVE MY NERVES
ARE GETTING OVERSTRETCHED MY MIND HAS SUFFERED SOMEWHAT TOO MUCH A
MALADY IS GROWING UPON IT WHAT SHALL I DO HOW SHALL I KEEP WELL
INDEED THERE WAS NO WAY TO KEEP WELL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
AT LAST A
DAY AND NIGHT OF PECULIARLY AGONIZING DEPRESSION WERE SUCCEEDED BY
PHYSICAL ILLNESS I TOOK PERFORCE TO MY BED
ABOUT THIS TIME THE INDIAN
SUMMER CLOSED AND THE EQUINOCTIAL STORMS BEGAN AND FOR NINE DARK AND
WET DAYS OF WHICH THE HOURS RUSHED ON ALL TURBULENT DEAF
DISHEVELLED BEWILDERED WITH SOUNDING HURRICANE I LAY IN A STRANGE
FEVER OF THE NERVES AND BLOOD
SLEEP WENT QUITE AWAY
I USED TO RISE IN
THE NIGHT LOOK ROUND FOR HER BESEECH HER EARNESTLY TO RETURN
A
RATTLE OF THE WINDOW A CRY OF THE BLAST ONLY REPLIED SLEEP NEVER
CAME
I ERR
SHE CAME ONCE BUT IN ANGER
IMPATIENT OF MY IMPORTUNITY SHE
BROUGHT WITH HER AN AVENGING DREAM
BY THE CLOCK OF ST
JEAN BAPTISTE
THAT DREAM REMAINED SCARCE FIFTEEN MINUTES A BRIEF SPACE BUT
SUFFICING TO WRING MY WHOLE FRAME WITH UNKNOWN ANGUISH TO CONFER A
NAMELESS EXPERIENCE THAT HAD THE HUE THE MIEN THE TERROR THE VERY
TONE OF A VISITATION FROM ETERNITY
BETWEEN TWELVE AND ONE THAT NIGHT A
CUP WAS FORCED TO MY LIPS BLACK STRONG STRANGE DRAWN FROM NO WELL
BUT FILLED UP SEETHING FROM A BOTTOMLESS AND BOUNDLESS SEA
SUFFERING
BREWED IN TEMPORAL OR CALCULABLE MEASURE AND MIXED FOR MORTAL LIPS
TASTES NOT AS THIS SUFFERING TASTED
HAVING DRANK AND WOKE I THOUGHT
ALL WAS OVER THE END COME AND PAST BY
TREMBLING FEARFULLY AS
CONSCIOUSNESS RETURNED READY TO CRY OUT ON SOME FELLOW CREATURE TO
HELP ME ONLY THAT I KNEW NO FELLOW CREATURE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO CATCH
THE WILD SUMMONS GOTON IN HER FAR DISTANT ATTIC COULD NOT HEAR I ROSE
ON MY KNEES IN BED
SOME FEARFUL HOURS WENT OVER ME INDESCRIBABLY WAS
I TORN RACKED AND OPPRESSED IN MIND
AMIDST THE HORRORS OF THAT DREAM
I THINK THE WORST LAY HERE
METHOUGHT THE WELL LOVED DEAD WHO HAD
LOVED ME WELL IN LIFE MET ME ELSEWHERE ALIENATED GALLED WAS MY
INMOST SPIRIT WITH AN UNUTTERABLE SENSE OF DESPAIR ABOUT THE FUTURE
MOTIVE THERE WAS NONE WHY I SHOULD TRY TO RECOVER OR WISH TO LIVE AND
YET QUITE UNENDURABLE WAS THE PITILESS AND HAUGHTY VOICE IN WHICH DEATH
CHALLENGED ME TO ENGAGE HIS UNKNOWN TERRORS
WHEN I TRIED TO PRAY I
COULD ONLY UTTER THESE WORDS FROM MY YOUTH UP THY TERRORS HAVE I
SUFFERED WITH A TROUBLED MIND
MOST TRUE WAS IT
ON BRINGING ME MY TEA NEXT MORNING GOTON URGED ME TO CALL IN A DOCTOR
I WOULD NOT I THOUGHT NO DOCTOR COULD CURE ME
ONE EVENING AND I WAS NOT DELIRIOUS I WAS IN MY SANE MIND I GOT
UP I DRESSED MYSELF WEAK AND SHAKING
THE SOLITUDE AND THE STILLNESS
OF THE LONG DORMITORY COULD NOT BE BORNE ANY LONGER THE GHASTLY WHITE
BEDS WERE TURNING INTO SPECTRES THE CORONAL OF EACH BECAME A
DEATH'S HEAD HUGE AND SUN BLEACHED DEAD DREAMS OF AN ELDER WORLD AND
MIGHTIER RACE LAY FROZEN IN THEIR WIDE GAPING EYEHOLES
THAT EVENING
MORE FIRMLY THAN EVER FASTENED INTO MY SOUL THE CONVICTION THAT FATE
WAS OF STONE AND HOPE A FALSE IDOL BLIND BLOODLESS AND OF GRANITE
CORE
I FELT TOO THAT THE TRIAL GOD HAD APPOINTED ME WAS GAINING ITS
CLIMAX AND MUST NOW BE TURNED BY MY OWN HANDS HOT FEEBLE TREMBLING
AS THEY WERE
IT RAINED STILL AND BLEW BUT WITH MORE CLEMENCY I
THOUGHT THAN IT HAD POURED AND RAGED ALL DAY
TWILIGHT WAS FALLING
AND I DEEMED ITS INFLUENCE PITIFUL FROM THE LATTICE I SAW COMING
NIGHT CLOUDS TRAILING LOW LIKE BANNERS DROOPING
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT
AT THIS HOUR THERE WAS AFFECTION AND SORROW IN HEAVEN ABOVE FOR ALL
PAIN SUFFERED ON EARTH BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF MY DREADFUL DREAM BECAME
ALLEVIATED THAT INSUFFERABLE THOUGHT OF BEING NO MORE LOVED NO MORE
OWNED HALF YIELDED TO HOPE OF THE CONTRARY I WAS SURE THIS HOPE WOULD
SHINE CLEARER IF I GOT OUT FROM UNDER THIS HOUSE ROOF WHICH WAS
CRUSHING AS THE SLAB OF A TOMB AND WENT OUTSIDE THE CITY TO A CERTAIN
QUIET HILL A LONG WAY DISTANT IN THE FIELDS
COVERED WITH A CLOAK I
COULD NOT BE DELIRIOUS FOR I HAD SENSE AND RECOLLECTION TO PUT ON WARM
CLOTHING FORTH I SET
THE BELLS OF A CHURCH ARRESTED ME IN PASSING
THEY SEEMED TO CALL ME IN TO THE SALUT AND I WENT IN
ANY SOLEMN
RITE ANY SPECTACLE OF SINCERE WORSHIP ANY OPENING FOR APPEAL TO GOD
WAS AS WELCOME TO ME THEN AS BREAD TO ONE IN EXTREMITY OF WANT
I KNELT
DOWN WITH OTHERS ON THE STONE PAVEMENT
IT WAS AN OLD SOLEMN CHURCH
ITS PERVADING GLOOM NOT GILDED BUT PURPLED BY LIGHT SHED THROUGH
STAINED GLASS
FEW WORSHIPPERS WERE ASSEMBLED AND THE SALUT OVER HALF OF THEM
DEPARTED
I DISCOVERED SOON THAT THOSE LEFT REMAINED TO CONFESS
I DID
NOT STIR
CAREFULLY EVERY DOOR OF THE CHURCH WAS SHUT A HOLY QUIET
SANK UPON AND A SOLEMN SHADE GATHERED ABOUT US
AFTER A SPACE
BREATHLESS AND SPENT IN PRAYER A PENITENT APPROACHED THE CONFESSIONAL
I WATCHED
SHE WHISPERED HER AVOWAL HER SHRIFT WAS WHISPERED BACK SHE
RETURNED CONSOLED
ANOTHER WENT AND ANOTHER
A PALE LADY KNEELING
NEAR ME SAID IN A LOW KIND VOICE GO YOU NOW I AM NOT QUITE
PREPARED
MECHANICALLY OBEDIENT I ROSE AND WENT
I KNEW WHAT I WAS ABOUT MY
MIND HAD RUN OVER THE INTENT WITH LIGHTNING SPEED
TO TAKE THIS STEP
COULD NOT MAKE ME MORE WRETCHED THAN I WAS IT MIGHT SOOTHE ME
THE PRIEST WITHIN THE CONFESSIONAL NEVER TURNED HIS EYES TO REGARD ME
HE ONLY QUIETLY INCLINED HIS EAR TO MY LIPS
HE MIGHT BE A GOOD MAN
BUT THIS DUTY HAD BECOME TO HIM A SORT OF FORM HE WENT THROUGH IT WITH
THE PHLEGM OF CUSTOM
I HESITATED OF THE FORMULA OF CONFESSION I WAS
IGNORANT INSTEAD OF COMMENCING THEN WITH THE PRELUDE USUAL I
SAID MON PRE JE SUIS PROTESTANTE
HE DIRECTLY TURNED
HE WAS NOT A NATIVE PRIEST OF THAT CLASS THE CAST
OF PHYSIOGNOMY IS ALMOST INVARIABLY GROVELLING I SAW BY HIS PROFILE
AND BROW HE WAS A FRENCHMAN THOUGH GREY AND ADVANCED IN YEARS HE DID
NOT I THINK LACK FEELING OR INTELLIGENCE
HE INQUIRED NOT UNKINDLY
WHY BEING A PROTESTANT I CAME TO HIM
I SAID I WAS PERISHING FOR A WORD OF ADVICE OR AN ACCENT OF COMFORT
I
HAD BEEN LIVING FOR SOME WEEKS QUITE ALONE I HAD BEEN ILL I HAD A
PRESSURE OF AFFLICTION ON MY MIND OF WHICH IT WOULD HARDLY ANY LONGER
ENDURE THE WEIGHT
WAS IT A SIN A CRIME HE INQUIRED SOMEWHAT STARTLED
I REASSURED
HIM ON THIS POINT AND AS WELL AS I COULD I SHOWED HIM THE MERE
OUTLINE OF MY EXPERIENCE
HE LOOKED THOUGHTFUL SURPRISED PUZZLED
YOU TAKE ME UNAWARES SAID
HE
I HAVE NOT HAD SUCH A CASE AS YOURS BEFORE ORDINARILY WE KNOW OUR
ROUTINE AND ARE PREPARED BUT THIS MAKES A GREAT BREAK IN THE COMMON
COURSE OF CONFESSION
I AM HARDLY FURNISHED WITH COUNSEL FITTING THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
OF COURSE I HAD NOT EXPECTED HE WOULD BE BUT THE MERE RELIEF OF
COMMUNICATION IN AN EAR WHICH WAS HUMAN AND SENTIENT YET
CONSECRATED THE MERE POURING OUT OF SOME PORTION OF LONG ACCUMULATING
LONG PENT UP PAIN INTO A VESSEL WHENCE IT COULD NOT BE AGAIN
DIFFUSED HAD DONE ME GOOD
I WAS ALREADY SOLACED
MUST I GO FATHER I ASKED OF HIM AS HE SAT SILENT
MY DAUGHTER HE SAID KINDLY AND I AM SURE HE WAS A KIND MAN HE HAD
A COMPASSIONATE EYE FOR THE PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER GO BUT I ASSURE
YOU YOUR WORDS HAVE STRUCK ME
CONFESSION LIKE OTHER THINGS IS APT TO
BECOME FORMAL AND TRIVIAL WITH HABIT
YOU HAVE COME AND POURED YOUR
HEART OUT A THING SELDOM DONE
I WOULD FAIN THINK YOUR CASE OVER AND
TAKE IT WITH ME TO MY ORATORY
WERE YOU OF OUR FAITH I SHOULD KNOW WHAT
TO SAY A MIND SO TOSSED CAN FIND REPOSE BUT IN THE BOSOM OF RETREAT
AND THE PUNCTUAL PRACTICE OF PIETY
THE WORLD IT IS WELL KNOWN HAS NO
SATISFACTION FOR THAT CLASS OF NATURES
HOLY MEN HAVE BIDDEN PENITENTS
LIKE YOU TO HASTEN THEIR PATH UPWARD BY PENANCE SELF DENIAL AND
DIFFICULT GOOD WORKS
TEARS ARE GIVEN THEM HERE FOR MEAT AND
DRINK BREAD OF AFFLICTION AND WATERS OF AFFLICTION THEIR RECOMPENCE
COMES HEREAFTER
IT IS MY OWN CONVICTION THAT THESE IMPRESSIONS UNDER
WHICH YOU ARE SMARTING ARE MESSENGERS FROM GOD TO BRING YOU BACK TO THE
TRUE CHURCH
YOU WERE MADE FOR OUR FAITH DEPEND UPON IT OUR FAITH
ALONE COULD HEAL AND HELP YOU PROTESTANTISM IS ALTOGETHER TOO DRY
COLD PROSAIC FOR YOU
THE FURTHER I LOOK INTO THIS MATTER THE MORE
PLAINLY I SEE IT IS ENTIRELY OUT OF THE COMMON ORDER OF THINGS
ON NO
ACCOUNT WOULD I LOSE SIGHT OF YOU
GO MY DAUGHTER FOR THE PRESENT
BUT RETURN TO ME AGAIN
I ROSE AND THANKED HIM
I WAS WITHDRAWING WHEN HE SIGNED ME TO RETURN
YOU MUST NOT COME TO THIS CHURCH SAID HE I SEE YOU ARE ILL AND
THIS CHURCH IS TOO COLD YOU MUST COME TO MY HOUSE I LIVE AND HE
GAVE ME HIS ADDRESS
BE THERE TO MORROW MORNING AT TEN
IN REPLY TO THIS APPOINTMENT I ONLY BOWED AND PULLING DOWN MY VEIL
AND GATHERING ROUND ME MY CLOAK I GLIDED AWAY
DID I DO YOU SUPPOSE READER CONTEMPLATE VENTURING AGAIN WITHIN THAT
WORTHY PRIEST'S REACH AS SOON SHOULD I HAVE THOUGHT OF WALKING INTO A
BABYLONISH FURNACE
THAT PRIEST HAD ARMS WHICH COULD INFLUENCE ME HE
WAS NATURALLY KIND WITH A SENTIMENTAL FRENCH KINDNESS TO WHOSE
SOFTNESS I KNEW MYSELF NOT WHOLLY IMPERVIOUS
WITHOUT RESPECTING SOME
SORTS OF AFFECTION THERE WAS HARDLY ANY SORT HAVING A FIBRE OF ROOT IN
REALITY WHICH I COULD RELY ON MY FORCE WHOLLY TO WITHSTAND
HAD I GONE
TO HIM HE WOULD HAVE SHOWN ME ALL THAT WAS TENDER AND COMFORTING AND
GENTLE IN THE HONEST POPISH SUPERSTITION
THEN HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO
KINDLE BLOW AND STIR UP IN ME THE ZEAL OF GOOD WORKS
I KNOW NOT HOW
IT WOULD ALL HAVE ENDED
WE ALL THINK OURSELVES STRONG IN SOME POINTS
WE ALL KNOW OURSELVES WEAK IN MANY THE PROBABILITIES ARE THAT HAD I
VISITED NUMERO 10 RUE DES MAGES AT THE HOUR AND DAY APPOINTED I
MIGHT JUST NOW INSTEAD OF WRITING THIS HERETIC NARRATIVE BE COUNTING
MY BEADS IN THE CELL OF A CERTAIN CARMELITE CONVENT ON THE BOULEVARD OF
CRCY IN VILLETTE
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF FNLON ABOUT THAT BENIGN
OLD PRIEST AND WHATEVER MOST OF HIS BRETHREN MAY BE AND WHATEVER I
MAY THINK OF HIS CHURCH AND CREED AND I LIKE NEITHER OF HIMSELF I
MUST EVER RETAIN A GRATEFUL RECOLLECTION
HE WAS KIND WHEN I NEEDED
KINDNESS HE DID ME GOOD
MAY HEAVEN BLESS HIM
TWILIGHT HAD PASSED INTO NIGHT AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT IN THE STREETS
ERE I ISSUED FROM THAT SOMBRE CHURCH
TO TURN BACK WAS NOW BECOME
POSSIBLE TO ME THE WILD LONGING TO BREATHE THIS OCTOBER WIND ON THE
LITTLE HILL FAR WITHOUT THE CITY WALLS HAD CEASED TO BE AN IMPERATIVE
IMPULSE AND WAS SOFTENED INTO A WISH WITH WHICH REASON COULD COPE SHE
PUT IT DOWN AND I TURNED AS I THOUGHT TO THE RUE FOSSETTE
BUT I HAD
BECOME INVOLVED IN A PART OF THE CITY WITH WHICH I WAS NOT FAMILIAR IT
WAS THE OLD PART AND FULL OF NARROW STREETS OF PICTURESQUE ANCIENT
AND MOULDERING HOUSES
I WAS MUCH TOO WEAK TO BE VERY COLLECTED AND I
WAS STILL TOO CARELESS OF MY OWN WELFARE AND SAFETY TO BE CAUTIOUS I
GREW EMBARRASSED I GOT IMMESHED IN A NETWORK OF TURNS UNKNOWN
I WAS
LOST AND HAD NO RESOLUTION TO ASK GUIDANCE OF ANY PASSENGER
IF THE STORM HAD LULLED A LITTLE AT SUNSET IT MADE UP NOW FOR LOST
TIME
STRONG AND HORIZONTAL THUNDERED THE CURRENT OF THE WIND FROM
NORTH WEST TO SOUTH EAST IT BROUGHT RAIN LIKE SPRAY AND SOMETIMES A
SHARP HAIL LIKE SHOT IT WAS COLD AND PIERCED ME TO THE VITALS
I BENT
MY HEAD TO MEET IT BUT IT BEAT ME BACK
MY HEART DID NOT FAIL AT ALL
IN THIS CONFLICT I ONLY WISHED THAT I HAD WINGS AND COULD ASCEND THE
GALE SPREAD AND REPOSE MY PINIONS ON ITS STRENGTH CAREER IN ITS
COURSE SWEEP WHERE IT SWEPT
WHILE WISHING THIS I SUDDENLY FELT
COLDER WHERE BEFORE I WAS COLD AND MORE POWERLESS WHERE BEFORE I WAS
WEAK
I TRIED TO REACH THE PORCH OF A GREAT BUILDING NEAR BUT THE MASS
OF FRONTAGE AND THE GIANT SPIRE TURNED BLACK AND VANISHED FROM MY EYES
INSTEAD OF SINKING ON THE STEPS AS I INTENDED I SEEMED TO PITCH
HEADLONG DOWN AN ABYSS
I REMEMBER NO MORE
CHAPTER XVI
AULD LANG SYNE
WHERE MY SOUL WENT DURING THAT SWOON I CANNOT TELL
WHATEVER SHE SAW
OR WHEREVER SHE TRAVELLED IN HER TRANCE ON THAT STRANGE NIGHT SHE KEPT
HER OWN SECRET NEVER WHISPERING A WORD TO MEMORY AND BAFFLING
IMAGINATION BY AN INDISSOLUBLE SILENCE
SHE MAY HAVE GONE UPWARD AND
COME IN SIGHT OF HER ETERNAL HOME HOPING FOR LEAVE TO REST NOW AND
DEEMING THAT HER PAINFUL UNION WITH MATTER WAS AT LAST DISSOLVED
WHILE
SHE SO DEEMED AN ANGEL MAY HAVE WARNED HER AWAY FROM HEAVEN'S
THRESHOLD AND GUIDING HER WEEPING DOWN HAVE BOUND HER ONCE MORE
ALL SHUDDERING AND UNWILLING TO THAT POOR FRAME COLD AND WASTED OF
WHOSE COMPANIONSHIP SHE WAS GROWN MORE THAN WEARY
I KNOW SHE RE ENTERED HER PRISON WITH PAIN WITH RELUCTANCE WITH A
MOAN AND A LONG SHIVER
THE DIVORCED MATES SPIRIT AND SUBSTANCE WERE
HARD TO RE UNITE THEY GREETED EACH OTHER NOT IN AN EMBRACE BUT A
RACKING SORT OF STRUGGLE
THE RETURNING SENSE OF SIGHT CAME UPON ME
RED AS IF IT SWAM IN BLOOD SUSPENDED HEARING RUSHED BACK LOUD LIKE
THUNDER CONSCIOUSNESS REVIVED IN FEAR I SAT UP APPALLED WONDERING
INTO WHAT REGION AMONGST WHAT STRANGE BEINGS I WAS WAKING
AT FIRST I
KNEW NOTHING I LOOKED ON A WALL WAS NOT A WALL A LAMP NOT A LAMP
I
SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WE CALL A GHOST AS WELL AS I DID THE
COMMONEST OBJECT WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF INTIMATING THAT ALL MY EYE
RESTED ON STRUCK IT AS SPECTRAL
BUT THE FACULTIES SOON SETTLED EACH IN
HIS PLACE THE LIFE MACHINE PRESENTLY RESUMED ITS WONTED AND REGULAR
WORKING
STILL I KNEW NOT WHERE I WAS ONLY IN TIME I SAW I HAD BEEN REMOVED
FROM THE SPOT WHERE I FELL I LAY ON NO PORTICO STEP NIGHT AND TEMPEST
WERE EXCLUDED BY WALLS WINDOWS AND CEILING
INTO SOME HOUSE I HAD
BEEN CARRIED BUT WHAT HOUSE
I COULD ONLY THINK OF THE PENSIONNAT IN THE RUE FOSSETTE
STILL
HALF DREAMING I TRIED HARD TO DISCOVER IN WHAT ROOM THEY HAD PUT ME
WHETHER THE GREAT DORMITORY OR ONE OF THE LITTLE DORMITORIES
I WAS
PUZZLED BECAUSE I COULD NOT MAKE THE GLIMPSES OF FURNITURE I SAW
ACCORD WITH MY KNOWLEDGE OF ANY OF THESE APARTMENTS
THE EMPTY WHITE
BEDS WERE WANTING AND THE LONG LINE OF LARGE WINDOWS
SURELY
THOUGHT I IT IS NOT TO MADAME BECK'S OWN CHAMBER THEY HAVE CARRIED
ME AND HERE MY EYE FELL ON AN EASY CHAIR COVERED WITH BLUE DAMASK
OTHER SEATS CUSHIONED TO MATCH DAWNED ON ME BY DEGREES AND AT LAST I
TOOK IN THE COMPLETE FACT OF A PLEASANT PARLOUR WITH A WOOD FIRE ON A
CLEAR SHINING HEARTH A CARPET WHERE ARABESQUES OF BRIGHT BLUE RELIEVED
A GROUND OF SHADED FAWN PALE WALLS OVER WHICH A SLIGHT BUT ENDLESS
GARLAND OF AZURE FORGET ME NOTS RAN MAZED AND BEWILDERED AMONGST MYRIAD
GOLD LEAVES AND TENDRILS
A GILDED MIRROR FILLED UP THE SPACE BETWEEN
TWO WINDOWS CURTAINED AMPLY WITH BLUE DAMASK
IN THIS MIRROR I SAW
MYSELF LAID NOT IN BED BUT ON A SOFA
I LOOKED SPECTRAL MY EYES
LARGER AND MORE HOLLOW MY HAIR DARKER THAN WAS NATURAL BY CONTRAST
WITH MY THIN AND ASHEN FACE
IT WAS OBVIOUS NOT ONLY FROM THE
FURNITURE BUT FROM THE POSITION OF WINDOWS DOORS AND FIREPLACE THAT
THIS WAS AN UNKNOWN ROOM IN AN UNKNOWN HOUSE
HARDLY LESS PLAIN WAS IT THAT MY BRAIN WAS NOT YET SETTLED FOR AS I
GAZED AT THE BLUE ARM CHAIR IT APPEARED TO GROW FAMILIAR SO DID A
CERTAIN SCROLL COUCH AND NOT LESS SO THE ROUND CENTRE TABLE WITH A
BLUE COVERING BORDERED WITH AUTUMN TINTED FOLIAGE AND ABOVE ALL TWO
LITTLE FOOTSTOOLS WITH WORKED COVERS AND A SMALL EBONY FRAMED CHAIR
OF WHICH THE SEAT AND BACK WERE ALSO WORKED WITH GROUPS OF BRILLIANT
FLOWERS ON A DARK GROUND
STRUCK WITH THESE THINGS I EXPLORED FURTHER
STRANGE TO SAY OLD
ACQUAINTANCE WERE ALL ABOUT ME AND AULD LANG SYNE SMILED OUT OF
EVERY NOOK
THERE WERE TWO OVAL MINIATURES OVER THE MANTEL PIECE OF
WHICH I KNEW BY HEART THE PEARLS ABOUT THE HIGH AND POWDERED HEADS
THE VELVETS CIRCLING THE WHITE THROATS THE SWELL OF THE FULL MUSLIN
KERCHIEFS THE PATTERN OF THE LACE SLEEVE RUFFLES
UPON THE
MANTEL SHELF THERE WERE TWO CHINA VASES SOME RELICS OF A DIMINUTIVE
TEA SERVICE AS SMOOTH AS ENAMEL AND AS THIN AS EGG SHELL AND A WHITE
CENTRE ORNAMENT A CLASSIC GROUP IN ALABASTER PRESERVED UNDER GLASS
OF ALL THESE THINGS I COULD HAVE TOLD THE PECULIARITIES NUMBERED THE
FLAWS OR CRACKS LIKE ANY CLAIRVOYANTE
ABOVE ALL THERE WAS A PAIR
OF HANDSCREENS WITH ELABORATE PENCIL DRAWINGS FINISHED LIKE LINE
ENGRAVINGS THESE MY VERY EYES ACHED AT BEHOLDING AGAIN RECALLING
HOURS WHEN THEY HAD FOLLOWED STROKE BY STROKE AND TOUCH BY TOUCH A
TEDIOUS FEEBLE FINICAL SCHOOL GIRL PENCIL HELD IN THESE FINGERS NOW
SO SKELETON LIKE
WHERE WAS I NOT ONLY IN WHAT SPOT OF THE WORLD BUT IN WHAT YEAR OF
OUR LORD FOR ALL THESE OBJECTS WERE OF PAST DAYS AND OF A DISTANT
COUNTRY
TEN YEARS AGO I BADE THEM GOOD BY SINCE MY FOURTEENTH YEAR
THEY AND I HAD NEVER MET
I GASPED AUDIBLY WHERE AM I
A SHAPE HITHERTO UNNOTICED STIRRED ROSE CAME FORWARD A SHAPE
INHARMONIOUS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT SERVING ONLY TO COMPLICATE THE
RIDDLE FURTHER
THIS WAS NO MORE THAN A SORT OF NATIVE BONNE IN A
COMMON PLACE BONNE'S CAP AND PRINT DRESS
SHE SPOKE NEITHER FRENCH NOR
ENGLISH AND I COULD GET NO INTELLIGENCE FROM HER NOT UNDERSTANDING
HER PHRASES OF DIALECT
BUT SHE BATHED MY TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD WITH
SOME COOL AND PERFUMED WATER AND THEN SHE HEIGHTENED THE CUSHION ON
WHICH I RECLINED MADE SIGNS THAT I WAS NOT TO SPEAK AND RESUMED HER
POST AT THE FOOT OF THE SOFA
SHE WAS BUSY KNITTING HER EYES THUS DRAWN FROM ME I COULD GAZE ON HER
WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
I DID MIGHTILY WONDER HOW SHE CAME THERE OR WHAT
SHE COULD HAVE TO DO AMONG THE SCENES OR WITH THE DAYS OF MY GIRLHOOD
STILL MORE I MARVELLED WHAT THOSE SCENES AND DAYS COULD NOW HAVE TO DO
WITH ME
TOO WEAK TO SCRUTINIZE THOROUGHLY THE MYSTERY I TRIED TO SETTLE IT BY
SAYING IT WAS A MISTAKE A DREAM A FEVER FIT AND YET I KNEW THERE
COULD BE NO MISTAKE AND THAT I WAS NOT SLEEPING AND I BELIEVED I WAS
SANE
I WISHED THE ROOM HAD NOT BEEN SO WELL LIGHTED THAT I MIGHT NOT
SO CLEARLY HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE PICTURES THE ORNAMENTS THE SCREENS
THE WORKED CHAIR
ALL THESE OBJECTS AS WELL AS THE BLUE DAMASK
FURNITURE WERE IN FACT PRECISELY THE SAME IN EVERY MINUTEST DETAIL
WITH THOSE I SO WELL REMEMBERED AND WITH WHICH I HAD BEEN SO
THOROUGHLY INTIMATE IN THE DRAWING ROOM OF MY GODMOTHER'S HOUSE AT
BRETTON
METHOUGHT THE APARTMENT ONLY WAS CHANGED BEING OF DIFFERENT
PROPORTIONS AND DIMENSIONS
I THOUGHT OF BEDREDDIN HASSAN TRANSPORTED IN HIS SLEEP FROM CAIRO TO
THE GATES OF DAMASCUS
HAD A GENIUS STOOPED HIS DARK WING DOWN THE
STORM TO WHOSE STRESS I HAD SUCCUMBED AND GATHERING ME FROM THE
CHURCH STEPS AND RISING HIGH INTO THE AIR AS THE EASTERN TALE SAID
HAD HE BORNE ME OVER LAND AND OCEAN AND LAID ME QUIETLY DOWN BESIDE A
HEARTH OF OLD ENGLAND BUT NO I KNEW THE FIRE OF THAT HEARTH BURNED
BEFORE ITS LARES NO MORE IT WENT OUT LONG AGO AND THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
HAD BEEN CARRIED ELSEWHERE
THE BONNE TURNED AGAIN TO SURVEY ME AND SEEING MY EYES WIDE OPEN AND
I SUPPOSE DEEMING THEIR EXPRESSION PERTURBED AND EXCITED SHE PUT DOWN
HER KNITTING
I SAW HER BUSIED FOR A MOMENT AT A LITTLE STAND SHE
POURED OUT WATER AND MEASURED DROPS FROM A PHIAL GLASS IN HAND SHE
APPROACHED ME
WHAT DARK TINGED DRAUGHT MIGHT SHE NOW BE OFFERING WHAT
GENII ELIXIR OR MAGI DISTILLATION
IT WAS TOO LATE TO INQUIRE I HAD SWALLOWED IT PASSIVELY AND AT ONCE
A TIDE OF QUIET THOUGHT NOW CAME GENTLY CARESSING MY BRAIN SOFTER AND
SOFTER ROSE THE FLOW WITH TEPID UNDULATIONS SMOOTHER THAN BALM
THE
PAIN OF WEAKNESS LEFT MY LIMBS MY MUSCLES SLEPT
I LOST POWER TO MOVE
BUT LOSING AT THE SAME TIME WISH IT WAS NO PRIVATION
THAT KIND BONNE
PLACED A SCREEN BETWEEN ME AND THE LAMP I SAW HER RISE TO DO THIS BUT
DO NOT REMEMBER SEEING HER RESUME HER PLACE IN THE INTERVAL BETWEEN
THE TWO ACTS I FELL ON SLEEP
AT WAKING LO ALL WAS AGAIN CHANGED
THE LIGHT OF HIGH DAY SURROUNDED
ME NOT INDEED A WARM SUMMER LIGHT BUT THE LEADEN GLOOM OF RAW AND
BLUSTERING AUTUMN
I FELT SURE NOW THAT I WAS IN THE PENSIONNAT SURE
BY THE BEATING RAIN ON THE CASEMENT SURE BY THE WUTHER OF WIND
AMONGST TREES DENOTING A GARDEN OUTSIDE SURE BY THE CHILL THE
WHITENESS THE SOLITUDE AMIDST WHICH I LAY
I SAY WHITENESS FOR THE
DIMITY CURTAINS DROPPED BEFORE A FRENCH BED BOUNDED MY VIEW
I LIFTED THEM I LOOKED OUT
MY EYE PREPARED TO TAKE IN THE RANGE OF A
LONG LARGE AND WHITEWASHED CHAMBER BLINKED BAFFLED ON ENCOUNTERING
THE LIMITED AREA OF A SMALL CABINET A CABINET WITH SEAGREEN WALLS
ALSO INSTEAD OF FIVE WIDE AND NAKED WINDOWS THERE WAS ONE HIGH
LATTICE SHADED WITH MUSLIN FESTOONS INSTEAD OF TWO DOZEN LITTLE
STANDS OF PAINTED WOOD EACH HOLDING A BASIN AND AN EWER THERE WAS A
TOILETTE TABLE DRESSED LIKE A LADY FOR A BALL IN A WHITE ROBE OVER A
PINK SKIRT A POLISHED AND LARGE GLASS CROWNED AND A PRETTY
PIN CUSHION FRILLED WITH LACE ADORNED IT
THIS TOILETTE TOGETHER WITH
A SMALL LOW GREEN AND WHITE CHINTZ ARM CHAIR A WASHSTAND TOPPED WITH
A MARBLE SLAB AND SUPPLIED WITH UTENSILS OF PALE GREENWARE
SUFFICIENTLY FURNISHED THE TINY CHAMBER
READER I FELT ALARMED WHY YOU WILL ASK
WHAT WAS THERE IN THIS
SIMPLE AND SOMEWHAT PRETTY SLEEPING CLOSET TO STARTLE THE MOST TIMID
MERELY THIS THESE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE COULD NOT BE REAL SOLID
ARM CHAIRS LOOKING GLASSES AND WASHSTANDS THEY MUST BE THE GHOSTS OF
SUCH ARTICLES OR IF THIS WERE DENIED AS TOO WILD AN HYPOTHESIS AND
CONFOUNDED AS I WAS I DID DENY IT THERE REMAINED BUT TO CONCLUDE
THAT I HAD MYSELF PASSED INTO AN ABNORMAL STATE OF MIND IN SHORT THAT
I WAS VERY ILL AND DELIRIOUS AND EVEN THEN MINE WAS THE STRANGEST
FIGMENT WITH WHICH DELIRIUM HAD EVER HARASSED A VICTIM
I KNEW I WAS OBLIGED TO KNOW THE GREEN CHINTZ OF THAT LITTLE CHAIR
THE LITTLE SNUG CHAIR ITSELF THE CARVED SHINING BLACK FOLIATED FRAME
OF THAT GLASS THE SMOOTH MILKY GREEN OF THE CHINA VESSELS ON THE
STAND THE VERY STAND TOO WITH ITS TOP OF GREY MARBLE SPLINTERED AT
ONE CORNER ALL THESE I WAS COMPELLED TO RECOGNISE AND TO HAIL AS
LAST NIGHT I HAD PERFORCE RECOGNISED AND HAILED THE ROSEWOOD THE
DRAPERY THE PORCELAIN OF THE DRAWING ROOM
BRETTON BRETTON AND TEN YEARS AGO SHONE REFLECTED IN THAT MIRROR
AND
WHY DID BRETTON AND MY FOURTEENTH YEAR HAUNT ME THUS WHY IF THEY CAME
AT ALL DID THEY NOT RETURN COMPLETE WHY HOVERED BEFORE MY DISTEMPERED
VISION THE MERE FURNITURE WHILE THE ROOMS AND THE LOCALITY WERE GONE
AS TO THAT PINCUSHION MADE OF CRIMSON SATIN ORNAMENTED WITH GOLD BEADS
AND FRILLED WITH THREAD LACE I HAD THE SAME RIGHT TO KNOW IT AS TO
KNOW THE SCREENS I HAD MADE IT MYSELF
RISING WITH A START FROM THE
BED I TOOK THE CUSHION IN MY HAND AND EXAMINED IT
THERE WAS THE
CIPHER L
L
B FORMED IN GOLD BEDS AND SURROUNDED WITH AN OVAL
WREATH EMBROIDERED IN WHITE SILK
THESE WERE THE INITIALS OF MY
GODMOTHER'S NAME LONISA LUCY BRETTON
AM I IN ENGLAND AM I AT BRETTON I MUTTERED AND HASTILY PULLING UP
THE BLIND WITH WHICH THE LATTICE WAS SHROUDED I LOOKED OUT TO TRY AND
DISCOVER WHERE I WAS HALF PREPARED TO MEET THE CALM OLD HANDSOME
BUILDINGS AND CLEAN GREY PAVEMENT OF ST
ANN'S STREET AND TO SEE AT
THE END THE TOWERS OF THE MINSTER OR IF OTHERWISE FULLY EXPECTANT OF
A TOWN VIEW SOMEWHERE A RUE IN VILLETTE IF NOT A STREET IN A PLEASANT
AND ANCIENT ENGLISH CITY
I LOOKED ON THE CONTRARY THROUGH A FRAME OF LEAFAGE CLUSTERING ROUND
THE HIGH LATTICE AND FORTH THENCE TO A GRASSY MEAD LIKE LEVEL A
LAWN TERRACE WITH TREES RISING FROM THE LOWER GROUND BEYOND HIGH
FOREST TREES SUCH AS I HAD NOT SEEN FOR MANY A DAY
THEY WERE NOW
GROANING UNDER THE GALE OF OCTOBER AND BETWEEN THEIR TRUNKS I TRACED
THE LINE OF AN AVENUE WHERE YELLOW LEAVES LAY IN HEAPS AND DRIFTS OR
WERE WHIRLED SINGLY BEFORE THE SWEEPING WEST WIND
WHATEVER LANDSCAPE
MIGHT LIE FURTHER MUST HAVE BEEN FLAT AND THESE TALL BEECHES SHUT IT
OUT
THE PLACE SEEMED SECLUDED AND WAS TO ME QUITE STRANGE I DID NOT
KNOW IT AT ALL
ONCE MORE I LAY DOWN
MY BED STOOD IN A LITTLE ALCOVE ON TURNING MY
FACE TO THE WALL THE ROOM WITH ITS BEWILDERING ACCOMPANIMENTS BECAME
EXCLUDED
EXCLUDED NO FOR AS I ARRANGED MY POSITION IN THIS HOPE
BEHOLD ON THE GREEN SPACE BETWEEN THE DIVIDED AND LOOPED UP CURTAINS
HUNG A BROAD GILDED PICTURE FRAME ENCLOSING A PORTRAIT
IT WAS
DRAWN WELL DRAWN THOUGH BUT A SKETCH IN WATER COLOURS A HEAD A
BOY'S HEAD FRESH LIFE LIKE SPEAKING AND ANIMATED
IT SEEMED A YOUTH
OF SIXTEEN FAIR COMPLEXIONED WITH SANGUINE HEALTH IN HIS CHEEK HAIR
LONG NOT DARK AND WITH A SUNNY SHEEN PENETRATING EYES AN ARCH
MOUTH AND A GAY SMILE
ON THE WHOLE A MOST PLEASANT FACE TO LOOK AT
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE CLAIMING A RIGHT TO THAT YOUTH'S
AFFECTIONS PARENTS FOR INSTANCE OR SISTERS
ANY ROMANTIC LITTLE
SCHOOL GIRL MIGHT ALMOST HAVE LOVED IT IN ITS FRAME
THOSE EYES LOOKED
AS IF WHEN SOMEWHAT OLDER THEY WOULD FLASH A LIGHTNING RESPONSE TO
LOVE I CANNOT TELL WHETHER THEY KEPT IN STORE THE STEADY BEAMING SHINE
OF FAITH
FOR WHATEVER SENTIMENT MET HIM IN FORM TOO FACILE HIS LIPS
MENACED BEAUTIFULLY BUT SURELY CAPRICE AND LIGHT ESTEEM
STRIVING TO TAKE EACH NEW DISCOVERY AS QUIETLY AS I COULD I WHISPERED
TO MYSELF
AH THAT PORTRAIT USED TO HANG IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM OVER THE
MANTEL PIECE SOMEWHAT TOO HIGH AS I THOUGHT
I WELL REMEMBER HOW I
USED TO MOUNT A MUSIC STOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF UNHOOKING IT HOLDING IT
IN MY HAND AND SEARCHING INTO THOSE BONNY WELLS OF EYES WHOSE GLANCE
UNDER THEIR HAZEL LASHES SEEMED LIKE A PENCILLED LAUGH AND WELL I
LIKED TO NOTE THE COLOURING OF THE CHEEK AND THE EXPRESSION OF THE
MOUTH I HARDLY BELIEVED FANCY COULD IMPROVE ON THE CURVE OF THAT
MOUTH OR OF THE CHIN EVEN MY IGNORANCE KNEW THAT BOTH WERE
BEAUTIFUL AND PONDERED PERPLEXED OVER THIS DOUBT HOW IT WAS THAT
WHAT CHARMED SO MUCH COULD AT THE SAME TIME SO KEENLY PAIN ONCE BY
WAY OF TEST I TOOK LITTLE MISSY HOME AND LIFTING HER IN MY ARMS
TOLD HER TO LOOK AT THE PICTURE
DO YOU LIKE IT POLLY I ASKED
SHE NEVER ANSWERED BUT GAZED LONG
AND AT LAST A DARKNESS WENT TREMBLING THROUGH HER SENSITIVE EYE AS SHE
SAID PUT ME DOWN SO I PUT HER DOWN SAYING TO MYSELF THE CHILD
FEELS IT TOO
ALL THESE THINGS DO I NOW THINK OVER ADDING HE HAD HIS FAULTS YET
SCARCE EVER WAS A FINER NATURE LIBERAL SUAVE IMPRESSIBLE MY
REFLECTIONS CLOSED IN AN AUDIBLY PRONOUNCED WORD GRAHAM
GRAHAM ECHOED A SUDDEN VOICE AT THE BEDSIDE
DO YOU WANT GRAHAM
I LOOKED
THE PLOT WAS BUT THICKENING THE WONDER BUT CULMINATING
IF
IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE THAT WELL REMEMBERED PICTURED FORM ON THE WALL
STILL STRANGER WAS IT TO TURN AND BEHOLD THE EQUALLY WELL REMEMBERED
LIVING FORM OPPOSITE A WOMAN A LADY MOST REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL TALL
WELL ATTIRED WEARING WIDOW'S SILK AND SUCH A CAP AS BEST BECAME HER
MATRON AND MOTHERLY BRAIDS OF HAIR
HERS TOO WAS A GOOD FACE TOO
MARKED PERHAPS NOW FOR BEAUTY BUT NOT FOR SENSE OR CHARACTER
SHE
WAS LITTLE CHANGED SOMETHING STERNER SOMETHING MORE ROBUST BUT SHE
WAS MY GODMOTHER STILL THE DISTINCT VISION OF MRS
BRETTON
I KEPT QUIET YET INTERNALLY I WAS MUCH AGITATED MY PULSE FLUTTERED
AND THE BLOOD LEFT MY CHEEK WHICH TURNED COLD
MADAM WHERE AM I I INQUIRED
IN A VERY SAFE ASYLUM WELL PROTECTED FOR THE PRESENT MAKE YOUR MIND
QUITE EASY TILL YOU GET A LITTLE BETTER YOU LOOK ILL THIS MORNING
I AM SO ENTIRELY BEWILDERED I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I CAN TRUST MY
SENSES AT ALL OR WHETHER THEY ARE MISLEADING ME IN EVERY PARTICULAR
BUT YOU SPEAK ENGLISH DO YOU NOT MADAM
I SHOULD THINK YOU MIGHT HEAR THAT IT WOULD PUZZLE ME TO HOLD A LONG
DISCOURSE IN FRENCH
YOU DO NOT COME FROM ENGLAND
I AM LATELY ARRIVED THENCE
HAVE YOU BEEN LONG IN THIS COUNTRY YOU
SEEM TO KNOW MY SON
DO I MADAM PERHAPS I DO
YOUR SON THE PICTURE THERE
THAT IS HIS PORTRAIT AS A YOUTH
WHILE LOOKING AT IT YOU PRONOUNCED
HIS NAME
GRAHAM BRETTON
SHE NODDED
I SPEAK TO MRS
BRETTON FORMERLY OF BRETTON SHIRE
QUITE RIGHT AND YOU I AM TOLD ARE AN ENGLISH TEACHER IN A FOREIGN
SCHOOL HERE MY SON RECOGNISED YOU AS SUCH
HOW WAS I FOUND MADAM AND BY WHOM
MY SON SHALL TELL YOU THAT BY AND BY SAID SHE BUT AT PRESENT YOU
ARE TOO CONFUSED AND WEAK FOR CONVERSATION TRY TO EAT SOME BREAKFAST
AND THEN SLEEP
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL I HAD UNDERGONE THE BODILY FATIGUE THE
PERTURBATION OF SPIRITS THE EXPOSURE TO WEATHER IT SEEMED THAT I WAS
BETTER THE FEVER THE REAL MALADY WHICH HAD OPPRESSED MY FRAME WAS
ABATING FOR WHEREAS DURING THE LAST NINE DAYS I HAD TAKEN NO SOLID
FOOD AND SUFFERED FROM CONTINUAL THIRST THIS MORNING ON BREAKFAST
BEING OFFERED I EXPERIENCED A CRAVING FOR NOURISHMENT AN INWARD
FAINTNESS WHICH CAUSED ME EAGERLY TO TASTE THE TEA THIS LADY OFFERED
AND TO EAT THE MORSEL OF DRY TOAST SHE ALLOWED IN ACCOMPANIMENT
IT WAS
ONLY A MORSEL BUT IT SUFFICED KEEPING UP MY STRENGTH TILL SOME TWO OR
THREE HOURS AFTERWARDS WHEN THE BONNE BROUGHT ME A LITTLE CUP OF BROTH
AND A BISCUIT
AS EVENING BEGAN TO DARKEN AND THE CEASELESS BLAST STILL BLEW WILD AND
COLD AND THE RAIN STREAMED ON DELUGE LIKE I GREW WEARY VERY WEARY
OF MY BED
THE ROOM THOUGH PRETTY WAS SMALL I FELT IT CONFINING I
LONGED FOR A CHANGE
THE INCREASING CHILL AND GATHERING GLOOM TOO
DEPRESSED ME I WANTED TO SEE TO FEEL FIRELIGHT
BESIDES I KEPT
THINKING OF THE SON OF THAT TALL MATRON WHEN SHOULD I SEE HIM
CERTAINLY NOT TILL I LEFT MY ROOM
AT LAST THE BONNE CAME TO MAKE MY BED FOR THE NIGHT
SHE PREPARED TO
WRAP ME IN A BLANKET AND PLACE ME IN THE LITTLE CHINTZ CHAIR BUT
DECLINING THESE ATTENTIONS I PROCEEDED TO DRESS MYSELF
THE BUSINESS WAS JUST ACHIEVED AND I WAS SITTING DOWN TO TAKE BREATH
WHEN MRS
BRETTON ONCE MORE APPEARED
DRESSED SHE EXCLAIMED SMILING WITH THAT SMILE I SO WELL KNEW A
PLEASANT SMILE THOUGH NOT SOFT
YOU ARE QUITE BETTER THEN QUITE
STRONG EH
SHE SPOKE TO ME SO MUCH AS OF OLD SHE USED TO SPEAK THAT I ALMOST
FANCIED SHE WAS BEGINNING TO KNOW ME
THERE WAS THE SAME SORT OF
PATRONAGE IN HER VOICE AND MANNER THAT AS A GIRL I HAD ALWAYS
EXPERIENCED FROM HER A PATRONAGE I YIELDED TO AND EVEN LIKED IT WAS
NOT FOUNDED ON CONVENTIONAL GROUNDS OF SUPERIOR WEALTH OR STATION IN
THE LAST PARTICULAR THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY INEQUALITY HER DEGREE WAS
MINE BUT ON NATURAL REASONS OF PHYSICAL ADVANTAGE IT WAS THE SHELTER
THE TREE GIVES THE HERB
I PUT A REQUEST WITHOUT FURTHER CEREMONY
DO LET ME GO DOWN STAIRS MADAM I AM SO COLD AND DULL HERE
I DESIRE NOTHING BETTER IF YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE CHANGE
WAS HER REPLY
COME THEN HERE IS AN ARM AND SHE OFFERED ME HERS I
TOOK IT AND WE DESCENDED ONE FLIGHT OF CARPETED STEPS TO A LANDING
WHERE A TALL DOOR STANDING OPEN GAVE ADMISSION INTO THE BLUE DAMASK
ROOM
HOW PLEASANT IT WAS IN ITS AIR OF PERFECT DOMESTIC COMFORT HOW
WARM IN ITS AMBER LAMP LIGHT AND VERMILION FIRE FLUSH TO RENDER THE
PICTURE PERFECT TEA STOOD READY ON THE TABLE AN ENGLISH TEA WHEREOF
THE WHOLE SHINING SERVICE GLANCED AT ME FAMILIARLY FROM THE SOLID
SILVER URN OF ANTIQUE PATTERN AND THE MASSIVE POT OF THE SAME METAL
TO THE THIN PORCELAIN CUPS DARK WITH PURPLE AND GILDING
I KNEW THE
VERY SEED CAKE OF PECULIAR FORM BAKED IN A PECULIAR MOULD WHICH
ALWAYS HAD A PLACE ON THE TEA TABLE AT BRETTON
GRAHAM LIKED IT AND
THERE IT WAS AS OF YORE SET BEFORE GRAHAM'S PLATE WITH THE SILVER
KNIFE AND FORK BESIDE IT
GRAHAM WAS THEN EXPECTED TO TEA GRAHAM WAS
NOW PERHAPS IN THE HOUSE ERE MANY MINUTES I MIGHT SEE HIM
SIT DOWN SIT DOWN SAID MY CONDUCTRESS AS MY STEP FALTERED A LITTLE
IN PASSING TO THE HEARTH
SHE SEATED ME ON THE SOFA BUT I SOON PASSED
BEHIND IT SAYING THE FIRE WAS TOO HOT IN ITS SHADE I FOUND ANOTHER
SEAT WHICH SUITED ME BETTER
MRS
BRETTON WAS NEVER WONT TO MAKE A FUSS
ABOUT ANY PERSON OR ANYTHING WITHOUT REMONSTRANCE SHE SUFFERED ME TO
HAVE MY OWN WAY
SHE MADE THE TEA AND SHE TOOK UP THE NEWSPAPER
I
LIKED TO WATCH EVERY ACTION OF MY GODMOTHER ALL HER MOVEMENTS WERE SO
YOUNG SHE MUST HAVE BEEN NOW ABOVE FIFTY YET NEITHER HER SINEWS NOR
HER SPIRIT SEEMED YET TOUCHED BY THE RUST OF AGE
THOUGH PORTLY SHE
WAS ALERT AND THOUGH SERENE SHE WAS AT TIMES IMPETUOUS GOOD HEALTH
AND AN EXCELLENT TEMPERAMENT KEPT HER GREEN AS IN HER SPRING
WHILE SHE READ I PERCEIVED SHE LISTENED LISTENED FOR HER SON
SHE WAS
NOT THE WOMAN EVER TO CONFESS HERSELF UNEASY BUT THERE WAS YET NO LULL
IN THE WEATHER AND IF GRAHAM WERE OUT IN THAT HOARSE WIND ROARING
STILL UNSATISFIED I WELL KNEW HIS MOTHER'S HEART WOULD BE OUT WITH HIM
TEN MINUTES BEHIND HIS TIME SAID SHE LOOKING AT HER WATCH THEN IN
ANOTHER MINUTE A LIFTING OF HER EYES FROM THE PAGE AND A SLIGHT
INCLINATION OF HER HEAD TOWARDS THE DOOR DENOTED THAT SHE HEARD SOME
SOUND
PRESENTLY HER BROW CLEARED AND THEN EVEN MY EAR LESS
PRACTISED CAUGHT THE IRON CLASH OF A GATE SWUNG TO STEPS ON GRAVEL
LASTLY THE DOOR BELL
HE WAS COME
HIS MOTHER FILLED THE TEAPOT FROM
THE URN SHE DREW NEARER THE HEARTH THE STUFFED AND CUSHIONED BLUE
CHAIR HER OWN CHAIR BY RIGHT BUT I SAW THERE WAS ONE WHO MIGHT WITH
IMPUNITY USURP IT
AND WHEN THAT ONE CAME UP THE STAIRS WHICH HE
SOON DID AFTER I SUPPOSE SOME SUCH ATTENTION TO THE TOILET AS THE
WILD AND WET NIGHT RENDERED NECESSARY AND STRODE STRAIGHT IN
IS IT YOU GRAHAM SAID HIS MOTHER HIDING A GLAD SMILE AND SPEAKING
CURTLY
WHO ELSE SHOULD IT BE MAMMA DEMANDED THE UNPUNCTUAL POSSESSING
HIMSELF IRREVERENTLY OF THE ABDICATED THRONE
DON'T YOU DESERVE COLD TEA FOR BEING LATE
I SHALL NOT GET MY DESERTS FOR THE URN SINGS CHEERILY
WHEEL YOURSELF TO THE TABLE LAZY BOY NO SEAT WILL SERVE YOU BUT
MINE IF YOU HAD ONE SPARK OF A SENSE OF PROPRIETY YOU WOULD ALWAYS
LEAVE THAT CHAIR FOR THE OLD LADY
SO I SHOULD ONLY THE DEAR OLD LADY PERSISTS IN LEAVING IT FOR ME
HOW
IS YOUR PATIENT MAMMA
WILL SHE COME FORWARD AND SPEAK FOR HERSELF SAID MRS
BRETTON
TURNING TO MY CORNER AND AT THIS INVITATION FORWARD I CAME
GRAHAM
COURTEOUSLY ROSE UP TO GREET ME
HE STOOD TALL ON THE HEARTH A FIGURE
JUSTIFYING HIS MOTHER'S UNCONCEALED PRIDE
SO YOU ARE COME DOWN SAID HE YOU MUST BE BETTER THEN MUCH BETTER
I SCARCELY EXPECTED WE SHOULD MEET THUS OR HERE
I WAS ALARMED LAST
NIGHT AND IF I HAD NOT BEEN FORCED TO HURRY AWAY TO A DYING PATIENT I
CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT YOU BUT MY MOTHER HERSELF IS SOMETHING
OF A DOCTRESS AND MARTHA AN EXCELLENT NURSE
I SAW THE CASE WAS A
FAINTING FIT NOT NECESSARILY DANGEROUS
WHAT BROUGHT IT ON I HAVE YET
TO LEARN AND ALL PARTICULARS MEANTIME I TRUST YOU REALLY DO FEEL
BETTER
MUCH BETTER I SAID CALMLY
MUCH BETTER I THANK YOU DR
JOHN
FOR READER THIS TALL YOUNG MAN THIS DARLING SON THIS HOST OF
MINE THIS GRAHAM BRETTON WAS DR
JOHN HE AND NO OTHER AND WHAT
IS MORE I ASCERTAINED THIS IDENTITY SCARCELY WITH SURPRISE
WHAT IS
MORE WHEN I HEARD GRAHAM'S STEP ON THE STAIRS I KNEW WHAT MANNER OF
FIGURE WOULD ENTER AND FOR WHOSE ASPECT TO PREPARE MY EYES
THE
DISCOVERY WAS NOT OF TO DAY ITS DAWN HAD PENETRATED MY PERCEPTIONS
LONG SINCE
OF COURSE I REMEMBERED YOUNG BRETTON WELL AND THOUGH TEN
YEARS FROM SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SIX MAY GREATLY CHANGE THE BOY AS THEY
MATURE HIM TO THE MAN YET THEY COULD BRING NO SUCH UTTER DIFFERENCE AS
WOULD SUFFICE WHOLLY TO BLIND MY EYES OR BAFFLE MY MEMORY
DR
JOHN
GRAHAM BRETTON RETAINED STILL AN AFFINITY TO THE YOUTH OF SIXTEEN HE
HAD HIS EYES HE HAD SOME OF HIS FEATURES TO WIT ALL THE
EXCELLENTLY MOULDED LOWER HALF OF THE FACE I FOUND HIM OUT SOON
I
FIRST RECOGNISED HIM ON THAT OCCASION NOTED SEVERAL CHAPTERS BACK
WHEN MY UNGUARDEDLY FIXED ATTENTION HAD DRAWN ON ME THE MORTIFICATION
OF AN IMPLIED REBUKE
SUBSEQUENT OBSERVATION CONFIRMED IN EVERY POINT
THAT EARLY SURMISE
I TRACED IN THE GESTURE THE PORT AND THE HABITS
OF HIS MANHOOD ALL HIS BOY'S PROMISE
I HEARD IN HIS NOW DEEP TONES
THE ACCENT OF FORMER DAYS
CERTAIN TURNS OF PHRASE PECULIAR TO HIM OF
OLD WERE PECULIAR TO HIM STILL AND SO WAS MANY A TRICK OF EYE AND
LIP MANY A SMILE MANY A SUDDEN RAY LEVELLED FROM THE IRID UNDER HIS
WELL CHARACTERED BROW
TO SAY ANYTHING ON THE SUBJECT TO HINT AT MY DISCOVERY HAD NOT
SUITED MY HABITS OF THOUGHT OR ASSIMILATED WITH MY SYSTEM OF FEELING
ON THE CONTRARY I HAD PREFERRED TO KEEP THE MATTER TO MYSELF
I LIKED
ENTERING HIS PRESENCE COVERED WITH A CLOUD HE HAD NOT SEEN THROUGH
WHILE HE STOOD BEFORE ME UNDER A RAY OF SPECIAL ILLUMINATION WHICH
SHONE ALL PARTIAL OVER HIS HEAD TREMBLED ABOUT HIS FEET AND CAST
LIGHT NO FARTHER
WELL I KNEW THAT TO HIM IT COULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE WERE I TO COME
FORWARD AND ANNOUNCE THIS IS LUCY SNOWE SO I KEPT BACK IN MY
TEACHER'S PLACE AND AS HE NEVER ASKED MY NAME SO I NEVER GAVE IT
HE
HEARD ME CALLED MISS AND MISS LUCY HE NEVER HEARD THE SURNAME
SNOWE AS TO SPONTANEOUS RECOGNITION THOUGH I PERHAPS WAS STILL
LESS CHANGED THAN HE THE IDEA NEVER APPROACHED HIS MIND AND WHY
SHOULD I SUGGEST IT
DURING TEA DR
JOHN WAS KIND AS IT WAS HIS NATURE TO BE THAT MEAL
OVER AND THE TRAY CARRIED OUT HE MADE A COSY ARRANGEMENT OF THE
CUSHIONS IN A CORNER OF THE SOFA AND OBLIGED ME TO SETTLE AMONGST
THEM
HE AND HIS MOTHER ALSO DREW TO THE FIRE AND ERE WE HAD SAT TEN
MINUTES I CAUGHT THE EYE OF THE LATTER FASTENED STEADILY UPON ME
WOMEN ARE CERTAINLY QUICKER IN SOME THINGS THAN MEN
WELL SHE EXCLAIMED PRESENTLY I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A STRONGER
LIKENESS GRAHAM HAVE YOU OBSERVED IT
OBSERVED WHAT WHAT AILS THE OLD LADY NOW HOW YOU STARE MAMMA ONE
WOULD THINK YOU HAD AN ATTACK OF SECOND SIGHT
TELL ME GRAHAM OF WHOM DOES THAT YOUNG LADY REMIND YOU POINTING TO
ME
MAMMA YOU PUT HER OUT OF COUNTENANCE
I OFTEN TELL YOU ABRUPTNESS IS
YOUR FAULT REMEMBER TOO THAT TO YOU SHE IS A STRANGER AND DOES NOT
KNOW YOUR WAYS
NOW WHEN SHE LOOKS DOWN NOW WHEN SHE TURNS SIDEWAYS WHO IS SHE
LIKE GRAHAM
INDEED MAMMA SINCE YOU PROPOUND THE RIDDLE I THINK YOU OUGHT TO
SOLVE IT
AND YOU HAVE KNOWN HER SOME TIME YOU SAY EVER SINCE YOU FIRST BEGAN
TO ATTEND THE SCHOOL IN THE RUE FOSSETTE YET YOU NEVER MENTIONED TO
ME THAT SINGULAR RESEMBLANCE
I COULD NOT MENTION A THING OF WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT AND WHICH I DO
NOT NOW ACKNOWLEDGE
WHAT CAN YOU MEAN
STUPID BOY LOOK AT HER
GRAHAM DID LOOK BUT THIS WAS NOT TO BE ENDURED I SAW HOW IT MUST END
SO I THOUGHT IT BEST TO ANTICIPATE
DR
JOHN I SAID HAS HAD SO MUCH TO DO AND THINK OF SINCE HE AND I
SHOOK HANDS AT OUR LAST PARTING IN ST
ANN'S STREET THAT WHILE I
READILY FOUND OUT MR
GRAHAM BRETTON SOME MONTHS AGO IT NEVER
OCCURRED TO ME AS POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD RECOGNISE LUCY SNOWE
LUCY SNOWE I THOUGHT SO I KNEW IT CRIED MRS
BRETTON
AND SHE AT
ONCE STEPPED ACROSS THE HEARTH AND KISSED ME
SOME LADIES WOULD
PERHAPS HAVE MADE A GREAT BUSTLE UPON SUCH A DISCOVERY WITHOUT BEING
PARTICULARLY GLAD OF IT BUT IT WAS NOT MY GODMOTHER'S HABIT TO MAKE A
BUSTLE AND SHE PREFERRED ALL SENTIMENTAL DEMONSTRATIONS IN BAS RELIEF
SO SHE AND I GOT OVER THE SURPRISE WITH FEW WORDS AND A SINGLE SALUTE
YET I DARESAY SHE WAS PLEASED AND I KNOW I WAS
WHILE WE RENEWED OLD
ACQUAINTANCE GRAHAM SITTING OPPOSITE SILENTLY DISPOSED OF HIS
PAROXYSM OF ASTONISHMENT
MAMMA CALLS ME A STUPID BOY AND I THINK I AM SO AT LENGTH HE SAID
FOR UPON MY HONOUR OFTEN AS I HAVE SEEN YOU I NEVER ONCE SUSPECTED
THIS FACT AND YET I PERCEIVE IT ALL NOW
LUCY SNOWE TO BE SURE I
RECOLLECT HER PERFECTLY AND THERE SHE SITS NOT A DOUBT OF IT
BUT
HE ADDED YOU SURELY HAVE NOT KNOWN ME AS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE ALL THIS
TIME AND NEVER MENTIONED IT
THAT I HAVE WAS MY ANSWER
DR
JOHN COMMENTED NOT
I SUPPOSED HE REGARDED MY SILENCE AS ECCENTRIC
BUT HE WAS INDULGENT IN REFRAINING FROM CENSURE
I DARESAY TOO HE
WOULD HAVE DEEMED IT IMPERTINENT TO HAVE INTERROGATED ME VERY CLOSELY
TO HAVE ASKED ME THE WHY AND WHEREFORE OF MY RESERVE AND THOUGH HE
MIGHT FEEL A LITTLE CURIOUS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CASE WAS BY NO MEANS
SUCH AS TO TEMPT CURIOSITY TO INFRINGE ON DISCRETION
FOR MY PART I JUST VENTURED TO INQUIRE WHETHER HE REMEMBERED THE
CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY ONCE LOOKING AT HIM VERY FIXEDLY FOR THE SLIGHT
ANNOYANCE HE HAD BETRAYED ON THAT OCCASION STILL LINGERED SORE ON MY
MIND
I THINK I DO SAID HE I THINK I WAS EVEN CROSS WITH YOU
YOU CONSIDERED ME A LITTLE BOLD PERHAPS I INQUIRED
NOT AT ALL
ONLY SHY AND RETIRING AS YOUR GENERAL MANNER WAS I
WONDERED WHAT PERSONAL OR FACIAL ENORMITY IN ME PROVED SO MAGNETIC TO
YOUR USUALLY AVERTED EYES
YOU SEE HOW IT WAS NOW
PERFECTLY
AND HERE MRS
BRETTON BROKE IN WITH MANY MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT PAST
TIMES AND FOR HER SATISFACTION I HAD TO RECUR TO GONE BY TROUBLES TO
EXPLAIN CAUSES OF SEEMING ESTRANGEMENT TO TOUCH ON SINGLE HANDED
CONFLICT WITH LIFE WITH DEATH WITH GRIEF WITH FATE
DR
JOHN
LISTENED SAYING LITTLE
HE AND SHE THEN TOLD ME OF CHANGES THEY HAD
KNOWN EVEN WITH THEM ALL HAD NOT GONE SMOOTHLY AND FORTUNE HAD
RETRENCHED HER ONCE ABUNDANT GIFTS
BUT SO COURAGEOUS A MOTHER WITH
SUCH A CHAMPION IN HER SON WAS WELL FITTED TO FIGHT A GOOD FIGHT WITH
THE WORLD AND TO PREVAIL ULTIMATELY
DR
JOHN HIMSELF WAS ONE OF THOSE
ON WHOSE BIRTH BENIGN PLANETS HAVE CERTAINLY SMILED
ADVERSITY MIGHT
SET AGAINST HIM HER MOST SULLEN FRONT HE WAS THE MAN TO BEAT HER DOWN
WITH SMILES
STRONG AND CHEERFUL AND FIRM AND COURTEOUS NOT RASH YET
VALIANT HE WAS THE ASPIRANT TO WOO DESTINY HERSELF AND TO WIN FROM
HER STONE EYEBALLS A BEAM ALMOST LOVING
IN THE PROFESSION HE HAD ADOPTED HIS SUCCESS WAS NOW QUITE DECIDED
WITHIN THE LAST THREE MONTHS HE HAD TAKEN THIS HOUSE A SMALL CHTEAU
THEY TOLD ME ABOUT HALF A LEAGUE WITHOUT THE PORTE DE CRCY THIS
COUNTRY SITE BEING CHOSEN FOR THE SAKE OF HIS MOTHER'S HEALTH WITH
WHICH TOWN AIR DID NOT NOW AGREE
HITHER HE HAD INVITED MRS
BRETTON
AND SHE ON LEAVING ENGLAND HAD BROUGHT WITH HER SUCH RESIDUE
FURNITURE OF THE FORMER ST
ANN'S STREET MANSION AS SHE HAD THOUGHT FIT
TO KEEP UNSOLD
HENCE MY BEWILDERMENT AT THE PHANTOMS OF CHAIRS AND
THE WRAITHS OF LOOKING GLASSES TEA URNS AND TEACUPS
AS THE CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN DR
JOHN STOPPED HIS MOTHER
MISS SNOWE MUST RETIRE NOW HE SAID SHE IS BEGINNING TO LOOK VERY
PALE
TO MORROW I WILL VENTURE TO PUT SOME QUESTIONS RESPECTING THE
CAUSE OF HER LOSS OF HEALTH
SHE IS MUCH CHANGED INDEED SINCE LAST
JULY WHEN I SAW HER ENACT WITH NO LITTLE SPIRIT THE PART OF A VERY
KILLING FINE GENTLEMAN
AS TO LAST NIGHT'S CATASTROPHE I AM SURE
THEREBY HANGS A TALE BUT WE WILL INQUIRE NO FURTHER THIS EVENING
GOOD NIGHT MISS LUCY
AND SO HE KINDLY LED ME TO THE DOOR AND HOLDING A WAX CANDLE LIGHTED
ME UP THE ONE FLIGHT OF STAIRS
WHEN I HAD SAID MY PRAYERS AND WHEN I WAS UNDRESSED AND LAID DOWN I
FELT THAT I STILL HAD FRIENDS
FRIENDS NOT PROFESSING VEHEMENT
ATTACHMENT NOT OFFERING THE TENDER SOLACE OF WELL MATCHED AND
CONGENIAL RELATIONSHIP ON WHOM THEREFORE BUT MODERATE DEMAND OF
AFFECTION WAS TO BE MADE OF WHOM BUT MODERATE EXPECTATION FORMED BUT
TOWARDS WHOM MY HEART SOFTENED INSTINCTIVELY AND YEARNED WITH AN
IMPORTUNATE GRATITUDE WHICH I ENTREATED REASON BETIMES TO CHECK
DO NOT LET ME THINK OF THEM TOO OFTEN TOO MUCH TOO FONDLY I
IMPLORED LET ME BE CONTENT WITH A TEMPERATE DRAUGHT OF THIS LIVING
STREAM LET ME NOT RUN ATHIRST AND APPLY PASSIONATELY TO ITS WELCOME
WATERS LET ME NOT IMAGINE IN THEM A SWEETER TASTE THAN EARTH'S
FOUNTAINS KNOW
OH WOULD TO GOD I MAY BE ENABLED TO FEEL ENOUGH
SUSTAINED BY AN OCCASIONAL AMICABLE INTERCOURSE RARE BRIEF
UNENGROSSING AND TRANQUIL QUITE TRANQUIL
STILL REPEATING THIS WORD I TURNED TO MY PILLOW AND STILL REPEATING
IT I STEEPED THAT PILLOW WITH TEARS
CHAPTER XVII
LA TERRASSE
THESE STRUGGLES WITH THE NATURAL CHARACTER THE STRONG NATIVE BENT OF
THE HEART MAY SEEM FUTILE AND FRUITLESS BUT IN THE END THEY DO GOOD
THEY TEND HOWEVER SLIGHTLY TO GIVE THE ACTIONS THE CONDUCT THAT
TURN WHICH REASON APPROVES AND WHICH FEELING PERHAPS TOO OFTEN
OPPOSES THEY CERTAINLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE GENERAL TENOUR OF A
LIFE AND ENABLE IT TO BE BETTER REGULATED MORE EQUABLE QUIETER ON
THE SURFACE AND IT IS ON THE SURFACE ONLY THE COMMON GAZE WILL FALL
AS TO WHAT LIES BELOW LEAVE THAT WITH GOD
MAN YOUR EQUAL WEAK AS
YOU AND NOT FIT TO BE YOUR JUDGE MAY BE SHUT OUT THENCE TAKE IT TO
YOUR MAKER SHOW HIM THE SECRETS OF THE SPIRIT HE GAVE ASK HIM HOW YOU
ARE TO BEAR THE PAINS HE HAS APPOINTED KNEEL IN HIS PRESENCE AND PRAY
WITH FAITH FOR LIGHT IN DARKNESS FOR STRENGTH IN PITEOUS WEAKNESS FOR
PATIENCE IN EXTREME NEED
CERTAINLY AT SOME HOUR THOUGH PERHAPS NOT
YOUR HOUR THE WAITING WATERS WILL STIR IN SOME SHAPE THOUGH
PERHAPS NOT THE SHAPE YOU DREAMED WHICH YOUR HEART LOVED AND FOR
WHICH IT BLED THE HEALING HERALD WILL DESCEND THE CRIPPLE AND THE
BLIND AND THE DUMB AND THE POSSESSED WILL BE LED TO BATHE
HERALD
COME QUICKLY THOUSANDS LIE ROUND THE POOL WEEPING AND DESPAIRING TO
SEE IT THROUGH SLOW YEARS STAGNANT
LONG ARE THE TIMES OF HEAVEN
THE ORBITS OF ANGEL MESSENGERS SEEM WIDE TO MORTAL VISION THEY MAY
ENRING AGES THE CYCLE OF ONE DEPARTURE AND RETURN MAY CLASP UNNUMBERED
GENERATIONS AND DUST KINDLING TO BRIEF SUFFERING LIFE AND THROUGH
PAIN PASSING BACK TO DUST MAY MEANWHILE PERISH OUT OF MEMORY AGAIN
AND YET AGAIN
TO HOW MANY MAIMED AND MOURNING MILLIONS IS THE FIRST
AND SOLE ANGEL VISITANT HIM EASTERNS CALL AZRAEL
I TRIED TO GET UP NEXT MORNING BUT WHILE I WAS DRESSING AND AT
INTERVALS DRINKING COLD WATER FROM THE CARAFE ON MY WASHSTAND WITH
DESIGN TO BRACE UP THAT TREMBLING WEAKNESS WHICH MADE DRESSING SO
DIFFICULT IN CAME MRS
BRETTON
HERE IS AN ABSURDITY WAS HER MORNING ACCOST
NOT SO SHE ADDED
AND DEALING WITH ME AT ONCE IN HER OWN BRUSQUE ENERGETIC FASHION THAT
FASHION WHICH I USED FORMERLY TO ENJOY SEEING APPLIED TO HER SON AND
BY HIM VIGOROUSLY RESISTED IN TWO MINUTES SHE CONSIGNED ME CAPTIVE TO
THE FRENCH BED
THERE YOU LIE TILL AFTERNOON SAID SHE
MY BOY LEFT ORDERS BEFORE HE
WENT OUT THAT SUCH SHOULD BE THE CASE AND I CAN ASSURE YOU MY SON IS
MASTER AND MUST BE OBEYED
PRESENTLY YOU SHALL HAVE BREAKFAST
PRESENTLY SHE BROUGHT THAT MEAL BROUGHT IT WITH HER OWN ACTIVE
HANDS NOT LEAVING ME TO SERVANTS
SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE BED WHILE
I ATE
NOW IT IS NOT EVERYBODY EVEN AMONGST OUR RESPECTED FRIENDS AND
ESTEEMED ACQUAINTANCE WHOM WE LIKE TO HAVE NEAR US WHOM WE LIKE TO
WATCH US TO WAIT ON US TO APPROACH US WITH THE PROXIMITY OF A NURSE
TO A PATIENT
IT IS NOT EVERY FRIEND WHOSE EYE IS A LIGHT IN A SICK
ROOM WHOSE PRESENCE IS THERE A SOLACE BUT ALL THIS WAS MRS
BRETTON
TO ME ALL THIS SHE HAD EVER BEEN
FOOD OR DRINK NEVER PLEASED ME SO
WELL AS WHEN IT CAME THROUGH HER HANDS
I DO NOT REMEMBER THE OCCASION
WHEN HER ENTRANCE INTO A ROOM HAD NOT MADE THAT ROOM CHEERIER
OUR
NATURES OWN PREDILECTIONS AND ANTIPATHIES ALIKE STRANGE
THERE ARE
PEOPLE FROM WHOM WE SECRETLY SHRINK WHOM WE WOULD PERSONALLY AVOID
THOUGH REASON CONFESSES THAT THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE THERE ARE OTHERS
WITH FAULTS OF TEMPER C EVIDENT ENOUGH BESIDE WHOM WE LIVE
CONTENT AS IF THE AIR ABOUT THEM DID US GOOD
MY GODMOTHER'S LIVELY
BLACK EYE AND CLEAR BRUNETTE CHEEK HER WARM PROMPT HAND HER
SELF RELIANT MOOD HER DECIDED BEARING WERE ALL BENEFICIAL TO ME AS
THE ATMOSPHERE OF SOME SALUBRIOUS CLIMATE
HER SON USED TO CALL HER
THE OLD LADY IT FILLED ME WITH PLEASANT WONDER TO NOTE HOW THE
ALACRITY AND POWER OF FIVE AND TWENTY STILL BREATHED FROM HER AND
AROUND HER
I WOULD BRING MY WORK HERE SHE SAID AS SHE TOOK FROM ME THE EMPTIED
TEACUP AND SIT WITH YOU THE WHOLE DAY IF THAT OVERBEARING JOHN
GRAHAM HAD NOT PUT HIS VETO UPON SUCH A PROCEEDING
'NOW MAMMA HE
SAID WHEN HE WENT OUT 'TAKE NOTICE YOU ARE NOT TO KNOCK UP YOUR
GOD DAUGHTER WITH GOSSIP AND HE PARTICULARLY DESIRED ME TO KEEP CLOSE
TO MY OWN QUARTERS AND SPARE YOU MY FINE COMPANY
HE SAYS LUCY HE
THINKS YOU HAVE HAD A NERVOUS FEVER JUDGING FROM YOUR LOOK IS THAT
SO
I REPLIED THAT I DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT MY AILMENT HAD BEEN BUT THAT
I HAD CERTAINLY SUFFERED A GOOD DEAL ESPECIALLY IN MIND
FURTHER ON
THIS SUBJECT I DID NOT CONSIDER IT ADVISABLE TO DWELL FOR THE DETAILS
OF WHAT I HAD UNDERGONE BELONGED TO A PORTION OF MY EXISTENCE IN WHICH
I NEVER EXPECTED MY GODMOTHER TO TAKE A SHARE
INTO WHAT A NEW REGION
WOULD SUCH A CONFIDENCE HAVE LED THAT HALE SERENE NATURE THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER AND ME MIGHT BE FIGURED BY THAT BETWEEN THE
STATELY SHIP CRUISING SAFE ON SMOOTH SEAS WITH ITS FULL COMPLEMENT OF
CREW A CAPTAIN GAY AND BRAVE AND VENTUROUS AND PROVIDENT AND THE
LIFE BOAT WHICH MOST DAYS OF THE YEAR LIES DRY AND SOLITARY IN AN OLD
DARK BOAT HOUSE ONLY PUTTING TO SEA WHEN THE BILLOWS RUN HIGH IN ROUGH
WEATHER WHEN CLOUD ENCOUNTERS WATER WHEN DANGER AND DEATH DIVIDE
BETWEEN THEM THE RULE OF THE GREAT DEEP
NO THE LOUISA BRETTON NEVER
WAS OUT OF HARBOUR ON SUCH A NIGHT AND IN SUCH A SCENE HER CREW COULD
NOT CONCEIVE IT SO THE HALF DROWNED LIFE BOAT MAN KEEPS HIS OWN
COUNSEL AND SPINS NO YARNS
SHE LEFT ME AND I LAY IN BED CONTENT IT WAS GOOD OF GRAHAM TO
REMEMBER ME BEFORE HE WENT OUT
MY DAY WAS LONELY BUT THE PROSPECT OF COMING EVENING ABRIDGED AND
CHEERED IT
THEN TOO I FELT WEAK AND REST SEEMED WELCOME AND AFTER
THE MORNING HOURS WERE GONE BY THOSE HOURS WHICH ALWAYS BRING EVEN
TO THE NECESSARILY UNOCCUPIED A SENSE OF BUSINESS TO BE DONE OF TASKS
WAITING FULFILMENT A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF OBLIGATION TO BE
EMPLOYED WHEN THIS STIRRING TIME WAS PAST AND THE SILENT DESCENT OF
AFTERNOON HUSHED HOUSEMAID STEPS ON THE STAIRS AND IN THE CHAMBERS I
THEN PASSED INTO A DREAMY MOOD NOT UNPLEASANT
MY CALM LITTLE ROOM SEEMED SOMEHOW LIKE A CAVE IN THE SEA
THERE WAS NO
COLOUR ABOUT IT EXCEPT THAT WHITE AND PALE GREEN SUGGESTIVE OF FOAM
AND DEEP WATER THE BLANCHED CORNICE WAS ADORNED WITH SHELL SHAPED
ORNAMENTS AND THERE WERE WHITE MOULDINGS LIKE DOLPHINS IN THE
CEILING ANGLES
EVEN THAT ONE TOUCH OF COLOUR VISIBLE IN THE RED SATIN
PINCUSHION BORE AFFINITY TO CORAL EVEN THAT DARK SHINING GLASS MIGHT
HAVE MIRRORED A MERMAID
WHEN I CLOSED MY EYES I HEARD A GALE
SUBSIDING AT LAST BEARING UPON THE HOUSE FRONT LIKE A SETTLING SWELL
UPON A ROCK BASE
I HEARD IT DRAWN AND WITHDRAWN FAR FAR OFF LIKE A
TIDE RETIRING FROM A SHORE OF THE UPPER WORLD A WORLD SO HIGH ABOVE
THAT THE RUSH OF ITS LARGEST WAVES THE DASH OF ITS FIERCEST BREAKERS
COULD SOUND DOWN IN THIS SUBMARINE HOME ONLY LIKE MURMURS AND A
LULLABY
AMIDST THESE DREAMS CAME EVENING AND THEN MARTHA BROUGHT A LIGHT WITH
HER AID I WAS QUICKLY DRESSED AND STRONGER NOW THAN IN THE MORNING I
MADE MY WAY DOWN TO THE BLUE SALOON UNASSISTED
DR
JOHN IT APPEARS HAD CONCLUDED HIS ROUND OF PROFESSIONAL CALLS
EARLIER THAN USUAL HIS FORM WAS THE FIRST OBJECT THAT MET MY EYES AS I
ENTERED THE PARLOUR HE STOOD IN THAT WINDOW RECESS OPPOSITE THE DOOR
READING THE CLOSE TYPE OF A NEWSPAPER BY SUCH DULL LIGHT AS CLOSING DAY
YET GAVE
THE FIRE SHONE CLEAR BUT THE LAMP STOOD ON THE TABLE UNLIT
AND TEA WAS NOT YET BROUGHT UP
AS TO MRS
BRETTON MY ACTIVE GODMOTHER WHO I AFTERWARDS FOUND HAD
BEEN OUT IN THE OPEN AIR ALL DAY LAY HALF RECLINED IN HER
DEEP CUSHIONED CHAIR ACTUALLY LOST IN A NAP
HER SON SEEING ME CAME
FORWARD
I NOTICED THAT HE TROD CAREFULLY NOT TO WAKE THE SLEEPER HE
ALSO SPOKE LOW HIS MELLOW VOICE NEVER HAD ANY SHARPNESS IN IT
MODULATED AS AT PRESENT IT WAS CALCULATED RATHER TO SOOTHE THAN
STARTLE SLUMBER
THIS IS A QUIET LITTLE CHTEAU HE OBSERVED AFTER INVITING ME TO SIT
NEAR THE CASEMENT
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED IT IN
YOUR WALKS THOUGH INDEED FROM THE CHAUSSE IT IS NOT VISIBLE JUST A
MILE BEYOND THE PORTE DE CRCY YOU TURN DOWN A LANE WHICH SOON BECOMES
AN AVENUE AND THAT LEADS YOU ON THROUGH MEADOW AND SHADE TO THE VERY
DOOR OF THIS HOUSE
IT IS NOT A MODERN PLACE BUT BUILT SOMEWHAT IN THE
OLD STYLE OF THE BASSE VILLE
IT IS RATHER A MANOIR THAN A CHTEAU
THEY CALL IT 'LA TERRASSE BECAUSE ITS FRONT RISES FROM A BROAD TURFED
WALK WHENCE STEPS LEAD DOWN A GRASSY SLOPE TO THE AVENUE
SEE YONDER
THE MOON RISES SHE LOOKS WELL THROUGH THE TREE BOLES
WHERE INDEED DOES THE MOON NOT LOOK WELL WHAT IS THE SCENE CONFINED
OR EXPANSIVE WHICH HER ORB DOES NOT HALLOW ROSY OR FIERY SHE MOUNTED
NOW ABOVE A NOT DISTANT BANK EVEN WHILE WE WATCHED HER FLUSHED ASCENT
SHE CLEARED TO GOLD AND IN VERY BRIEF SPACE FLOATED UP STAINLESS INTO
A NOW CALM SKY
DID MOONLIGHT SOFTEN OR SADDEN DR
BRETTON DID IT
TOUCH HIM WITH ROMANCE I THINK IT DID
ALBEIT OF NO SIGHING MOOD HE
SIGHED IN WATCHING IT SIGHED TO HIMSELF QUIETLY
NO NEED TO PONDER THE
CAUSE OR THE COURSE OF THAT SIGH I KNEW IT WAS WAKENED BY BEAUTY I
KNEW IT PURSUED GINEVRA
KNOWING THIS THE IDEA PRESSED UPON ME THAT IT
WAS IN SOME SORT MY DUTY TO SPEAK THE NAME HE MEDITATED
OF COURSE HE
WAS READY FOR THE SUBJECT I SAW IN HIS COUNTENANCE A TEEMING PLENITUDE
OF COMMENT QUESTION AND INTEREST A PRESSURE OF LANGUAGE AND
SENTIMENT ONLY CHECKED I THOUGHT BY SENSE OF EMBARRASSMENT HOW TO
BEGIN
TO SPARE HIM THIS EMBARRASSMENT WAS MY BEST INDEED MY SOLE USE
I HAD BUT TO UTTER THE IDOL'S NAME AND LOVE'S TENDER LITANY WOULD FLOW
OUT
I HAD JUST FOUND A FITTING PHRASE YOU KNOW THAT MISS FANSHAWE IS
GONE ON A TOUR WITH THE CHOLMONDELEYS AND WAS OPENING MY LIPS TO
SPEAK TO IT WHEN HE SCATTERED MY PLANS BY INTRODUCING ANOTHER THEME
THE FIRST THING THIS MORNING SAID HE PUTTING HIS SENTIMENT IN HIS
POCKET TURNING FROM THE MOON AND SITTING DOWN I WENT TO THE RUE
FOSSETTE AND TOLD THE CUISINIRE THAT YOU WERE SAFE AND IN GOOD HANDS
DO YOU KNOW THAT I ACTUALLY FOUND THAT SHE HAD NOT YET DISCOVERED YOUR
ABSENCE FROM THE HOUSE SHE THOUGHT YOU SAFE IN THE GREAT DORMITORY
WITH WHAT CARE YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WAITED ON
OH ALL THAT IS VERY CONCEIVABLE SAID I
GOTON COULD DO NOTHING FOR
ME BUT BRING ME A LITTLE TISANE AND A CRUST OF BREAD AND I HAD
REJECTED BOTH SO OFTEN DURING THE PAST WEEK THAT THE GOOD WOMAN GOT
TIRED OF USELESS JOURNEYS FROM THE DWELLING HOUSE KITCHEN TO THE
SCHOOL DORMITORY AND ONLY CAME ONCE A DAY AT NOON TO MAKE MY BED
I
BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT SHE IS A GOOD NATURED CREATURE AND WOULD HAVE
BEEN DELIGHTED TO COOK ME CTELETTES DE MOUTON IF I COULD HAVE EATEN
THEM
WHAT DID MADAME BECK MEAN BY LEAVING YOU ALONE
MADAME BECK COULD NOT FORESEE THAT I SHOULD FALL ILL
YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BORE A GOOD SHARE OF THE SUFFERING
I AM NOT QUITE SURE WHAT MY NERVOUS SYSTEM IS BUT I WAS DREADFULLY
LOW SPIRITED
WHICH DISABLES ME FROM HELPING YOU BY PILL OR POTION
MEDICINE CAN
GIVE NOBODY GOOD SPIRITS
MY ART HALTS AT THE THRESHOLD OF
HYPOCHONDRIA SHE JUST LOOKS IN AND SEES A CHAMBER OF TORTURE BUT CAN
NEITHER SAY NOR DO MUCH
CHEERFUL SOCIETY WOULD BE OF USE YOU SHOULD
BE AS LITTLE ALONE AS POSSIBLE YOU SHOULD TAKE PLENTY OF EXERCISE
ACQUIESCENCE AND A PAUSE FOLLOWED THESE REMARKS
THEY SOUNDED ALL
RIGHT I THOUGHT AND BORE THE SAFE SANCTION OF CUSTOM AND THE
WELL WORN STAMP OF USE
MISS SNOWE RECOMMENCED DR
JOHN MY HEALTH NERVOUS SYSTEM INCLUDED
BEING NOW SOMEWHAT TO MY RELIEF DISCUSSED AND DONE WITH IS IT
PERMITTED ME TO ASK WHAT YOUR RELIGION IS ARE YOU A CATHOLIC
I LOOKED UP IN SOME SURPRISE A CATHOLIC NO WHY SUGGEST SUCH AN
IDEA
THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU WERE CONSIGNED TO ME LAST NIGHT MADE ME DOUBT
I CONSIGNED TO YOU BUT INDEED I FORGET
IT YET REMAINS FOR ME TO
LEARN HOW I FELL INTO YOUR HANDS
WHY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PUZZLED ME
I HAD BEEN IN ATTENDANCE ALL
DAY YESTERDAY ON A CASE OF SINGULARLY INTERESTING AND CRITICAL
CHARACTER THE DISEASE BEING RARE AND ITS TREATMENT DOUBTFUL I SAW A
SIMILAR AND STILL FINER CASE IN A HOSPITAL IN PARIS BUT THAT WILL NOT
INTEREST YOU
AT LAST A MITIGATION OF THE PATIENT'S MOST URGENT
SYMPTOMS ACUTE PAIN IS ONE OF ITS ACCOMPANIMENTS LIBERATED ME AND I
SET OUT HOMEWARD
MY SHORTEST WAY LAY THROUGH THE BASSE VILLE AND AS
THE NIGHT WAS EXCESSIVELY DARK WILD AND WET I TOOK IT
IN RIDING
PAST AN OLD CHURCH BELONGING TO A COMMUNITY OF BGUINES I SAW BY A
LAMP BURNING OVER THE PORCH OR DEEP ARCH OF THE ENTRANCE A PRIEST
LIFTING SOME OBJECT IN HIS ARMS
THE LAMP WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO REVEAL
THE PRIEST'S FEATURES CLEARLY AND I RECOGNISED HIM HE WAS A MAN I
HAVE OFTEN MET BY THE SICK BEDS OF BOTH RICH AND POOR AND CHIEFLY THE
LATTER
HE IS I THINK A GOOD OLD MAN FAR BETTER THAN MOST OF HIS
CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY SUPERIOR INDEED IN EVERY WAY BETTER INFORMED
AS WELL AS MORE DEVOTED TO DUTY
OUR EYES MET HE CALLED ON ME TO STOP
WHAT HE SUPPORTED WAS A WOMAN FAINTING OR DYING
I ALIGHTED
'THIS PERSON IS ONE OF YOUR COUNTRYWOMEN HE SAID 'SAVE HER IF SHE
IS NOT DEAD
MY COUNTRYWOMAN ON EXAMINATION TURNED OUT TO BE THE ENGLISH TEACHER
AT MADAME BECK'S PENSIONNAT
SHE WAS PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS PERFECTLY
BLOODLESS AND NEARLY COLD
'WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN WAS MY INQUIRY
HE COMMUNICATED A CURIOUS ACCOUNT THAT YOU HAD BEEN TO HIM THAT
EVENING AT CONFESSIONAL THAT YOUR EXHAUSTED AND SUFFERING APPEARANCE
COUPLED WITH SOME THINGS YOU HAD SAID
THINGS I HAD SAID I WONDER WHAT THINGS
AWFUL CRIMES NO DOUBT BUT HE DID NOT TELL ME WHAT THERE YOU KNOW
THE SEAL OF THE CONFESSIONAL CHECKED HIS GARRULITY AND MY CURIOSITY
YOUR CONFIDENCES HOWEVER HAD NOT MADE AN ENEMY OF THE GOOD FATHER IT
SEEMS HE WAS SO STRUCK AND FELT SO SORRY THAT YOU SHOULD BE OUT ON
SUCH A NIGHT ALONE THAT HE HAD ESTEEMED IT A CHRISTIAN DUTY TO WATCH
YOU WHEN YOU QUITTED THE CHURCH AND SO TO MANAGE AS NOT TO LOSE SIGHT
OF YOU TILL YOU SHOULD HAVE REACHED HOME
PERHAPS THE WORTHY MAN
MIGHT HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY HAVE BLENT IN THIS PROCEEDING SOME LITTLE OF
THE SUBTLETY OF HIS CLASS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS RESOLVE TO LEARN THE
LOCALITY OF YOUR HOME DID YOU IMPART THAT IN YOUR CONFESSION
I DID NOT ON THE CONTRARY I CAREFULLY AVOIDED THE SHADOW OF ANY
INDICATION AND AS TO MY CONFESSION DR
JOHN I SUPPOSE YOU WILL THINK
ME MAD FOR TAKING SUCH A STEP BUT I COULD NOT HELP IT I SUPPOSE IT
WAS ALL THE FAULT OF WHAT YOU CALL MY 'NERVOUS SYSTEM I CANNOT PUT
THE CASE INTO WORDS BUT MY DAYS AND NIGHTS WERE GROWN INTOLERABLE A
CRUEL SENSE OF DESOLATION PAINED MY MIND A FEELING THAT WOULD MAKE ITS
WAY RUSH OUT OR KILL ME LIKE AND THIS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND DR
JOHN THE CURRENT WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE HEART AND WHICH IF
ANEURISM OR ANY OTHER MORBID CAUSE OBSTRUCTS ITS NATURAL CHANNELS
SEEKS ABNORMAL OUTLET
I WANTED COMPANIONSHIP I WANTED FRIENDSHIP I
WANTED COUNSEL
I COULD FIND NONE OF THESE IN CLOSET OR CHAMBER SO I
WENT AND SOUGHT THEM IN CHURCH AND CONFESSIONAL
AS TO WHAT I SAID IT
WAS NO CONFIDENCE NO NARRATIVE
I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG MY LIFE HAS
NOT BEEN ACTIVE ENOUGH FOR ANY DARK DEED EITHER OF ROMANCE OR REALITY
ALL I POURED OUT WAS A DREARY DESPERATE COMPLAINT
LUCY YOU OUGHT TO TRAVEL FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS WHY YOUR CALM NATURE
IS GROWING QUITE EXCITABLE CONFOUND MADAME BECK HAS THE LITTLE BUXOM
WIDOW NO BOWELS TO CONDEMN HER BEST TEACHER TO SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
IT WAS NOT MADAME BECK'S FAULT SAID I IT IS NO LIVING BEING'S
FAULT AND I WON'T HEAR ANY ONE BLAMED
WHO IS IN THE WRONG THEN LUCY
ME DR
JOHN ME AND A GREAT ABSTRACTION ON WHOSE WIDE SHOULDERS I
LIKE TO LAY THE MOUNTAINS OF BLAME THEY WERE SCULPTURED TO BEAR ME AND
FATE
'ME' MUST TAKE BETTER CARE IN FUTURE SAID DR
JOHN SMILING I
SUPPOSE AT MY BAD GRAMMAR
CHANGE OF AIR CHANGE OF SCENE THOSE ARE MY PRESCRIPTIONS PURSUED
THE PRACTICAL YOUNG DOCTOR
BUT TO RETURN TO OUR MUTTONS LUCY
AS
YET PRE SILAS WITH ALL HIS TACT THEY SAY HE IS A JESUIT IS NO
WISER THAN YOU CHOOSE HIM TO BE FOR INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO THE RUE
FOSSETTE YOUR FEVERED WANDERINGS THERE MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH FEVER
NO DR
JOHN THE FEVER TOOK ITS TURN THAT NIGHT NOW DON'T MAKE OUT
THAT I WAS DELIRIOUS FOR I KNOW DIFFERENTLY
GOOD YOU WERE AS COLLECTED AS MYSELF AT THIS MOMENT NO DOUBT
YOUR
WANDERINGS HAD TAKEN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THE PENSIONNAT
NEAR THE
BGUINAGE AMIDST THE STRESS OF FLOOD AND GUST AND IN THE PERPLEXITY
OF DARKNESS YOU HAD SWOONED AND FALLEN
THE PRIEST CAME TO YOUR
SUCCOUR AND THE PHYSICIAN AS WE HAVE SEEN SUPERVENED
BETWEEN US WE
PROCURED A FIACRE AND BROUGHT YOU HERE
PRE SILAS OLD AS HE IS WOULD
CARRY YOU UP STAIRS AND LAY YOU ON THAT COUCH HIMSELF
HE WOULD
CERTAINLY HAVE REMAINED WITH YOU TILL SUSPENDED ANIMATION HAD BEEN
RESTORED AND SO SHOULD I BUT AT THAT JUNCTURE A HURRIED MESSENGER
ARRIVED FROM THE DYING PATIENT I HAD SCARCELY LEFT THE LAST DUTIES
WERE CALLED FOR THE PHYSICIAN'S LAST VISIT AND THE PRIEST'S LAST RITE
EXTREME UNCTION COULD NOT BE DEFERRED
PRE SILAS AND MYSELF DEPARTED
TOGETHER MY MOTHER WAS SPENDING THE EVENING ABROAD WE GAVE YOU IN
CHARGE TO MARTHA LEAVING DIRECTIONS WHICH IT SEEMS SHE FOLLOWED
SUCCESSFULLY
NOW ARE YOU A CATHOLIC
NOT YET SAID I WITH A SMILE
AND NEVER LET PRE SILAS KNOW WHERE I
LIVE OR HE WILL TRY TO CONVERT ME BUT GIVE HIM MY BEST AND TRUEST
THANKS WHEN YOU SEE HIM AND IF EVER I GET RICH I WILL SEND HIM MONEY
FOR HIS CHARITIES
SEE DR
JOHN YOUR MOTHER WAKES YOU OUGHT TO RING
FOR TEA
WHICH HE DID AND AS MRS
BRETTON SAT UP ASTONISHED AND INDIGNANT AT
HERSELF FOR THE INDULGENCE TO WHICH SHE HAD SUCCUMBED AND FULLY
PREPARED TO DENY THAT SHE HAD SLEPT AT ALL HER SON CAME GAILY TO THE
ATTACK
HUSHABY MAMMA SLEEP AGAIN
YOU LOOK THE PICTURE OF INNOCENCE IN YOUR
SLUMBERS
MY SLUMBERS JOHN GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW I NEVER
DO SLEEP BY DAY IT WAS THE SLIGHTEST DOZE POSSIBLE
EXACTLY A SERAPH'S GENTLE LAPSE A FAIRY'S DREAM
MAMMA UNDER SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES YOU ALWAYS REMIND ME OF TITANIA
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF ARE SO LIKE BOTTOM
MISS SNOWE DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING LIKE MAMMA'S WIT SHE IS A MOST
SPRIGHTLY WOMAN OF HER SIZE AND AGE
KEEP YOUR COMPLIMENTS TO YOURSELF SIR AND DO NOT NEGLECT YOUR OWN
SIZE WHICH SEEMS TO ME A GOOD DEAL ON THE INCREASE
LUCY HAS HE NOT
RATHER THE AIR OF AN INCIPIENT JOHN BULL HE USED TO BE SLENDER AS AN
EEL AND NOW I FANCY IN HIM A SORT OF HEAVY DRAGOON BENT A BEEF EATER
TENDENCY
GRAHAM TAKE NOTICE IF YOU GROW FAT I DISOWN YOU
AS IF YOU COULD NOT SOONER DISOWN YOUR OWN PERSONALITY I AM
INDISPENSABLE TO THE OLD LADY'S HAPPINESS LUCY
SHE WOULD PINE AWAY IN
GREEN AND YELLOW MELANCHOLY IF SHE HAD NOT MY SIX FEET OF INIQUITY TO
SCOLD
IT KEEPS HER LIVELY IT MAINTAINS THE WHOLESOME FERMENT OF HER
SPIRITS
THE TWO WERE NOW STANDING OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER ONE ON EACH SIDE THE
FIRE PLACE THEIR WORDS WERE NOT VERY FOND BUT THEIR MUTUAL LOOKS
ATONED FOR VERBAL DEFICIENCIES
AT LEAST THE BEST TREASURE OF MRS
BRETTON'S LIFE WAS CERTAINLY CASKETED IN HER SON'S BOSOM HER DEAREST
PULSE THROBBED IN HIS HEART
AS TO HIM OF COURSE ANOTHER LOVE SHARED
HIS FEELINGS WITH FILIAL LOVE AND NO DOUBT AS THE NEW PASSION WAS
THE LATEST BORN SO HE ASSIGNED IT IN HIS EMOTIONS BENJAMIN'S PORTION
GINEVRA GINEVRA DID MRS
BRETTON YET KNOW AT WHOSE FEET HER OWN YOUNG
IDOL HAD LAID HIS HOMAGE WOULD SHE APPROVE THAT CHOICE I COULD NOT
TELL BUT I COULD WELL GUESS THAT IF SHE KNEW MISS FANSHAWE'S CONDUCT
TOWARDS GRAHAM HER ALTERNATIONS BETWEEN COLDNESS AND COAXING AND
REPULSE AND ALLUREMENT IF SHE COULD AT ALL SUSPECT THE PAIN WITH WHICH
SHE HAD TRIED HIM IF SHE COULD HAVE SEEN AS I HAD SEEN HIS FINE
SPIRITS SUBDUED AND HARASSED HIS INFERIOR PREFERRED BEFORE HIM HIS
SUBORDINATE MADE THE INSTRUMENT OF HIS HUMILIATION THEN MRS
BRETTON
WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED GINEVRA IMBECILE OR PERVERTED OR BOTH
WELL I
THOUGHT SO TOO
THAT SECOND EVENING PASSED AS SWEETLY AS THE FIRST MORE SWEETLY
INDEED WE ENJOYED A SMOOTHER INTERCHANGE OF THOUGHT OLD TROUBLES WERE
NOT REVERTED TO ACQUAINTANCE WAS BETTER CEMENTED I FELT HAPPIER
EASIER MORE AT HOME
THAT NIGHT INSTEAD OF CRYING MYSELF ASLEEP I
WENT DOWN TO DREAMLAND BY A PATHWAY BORDERED WITH PLEASANT THOUGHTS
CHAPTER XVIII
WE QUARREL
DURING THE FIRST DAYS OF MY STAY AT THE TERRACE GRAHAM NEVER TOOK A
SEAT NEAR ME OR IN HIS FREQUENT PACING OF THE ROOM APPROACHED THE
QUARTER WHERE I SAT OR LOOKED PRE OCCUPIED OR MORE GRAVE THAN USUAL
BUT I THOUGHT OF MISS FANSHAWE AND EXPECTED HER NAME TO LEAP FROM HIS
LIPS
I KEPT MY EAR AND MIND IN PERPETUAL READINESS FOR THE TENDER
THEME MY PATIENCE WAS ORDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY UNDER ARMS AND MY
SYMPATHY DESIRED TO KEEP ITS CORNUCOPIA REPLENISHED AND READY FOR
OUTPOURING
AT LAST AND AFTER A LITTLE INWARD STRUGGLE WHICH I SAW
AND RESPECTED HE ONE DAY LAUNCHED INTO THE TOPIC
IT WAS INTRODUCED
DELICATELY ANONYMOUSLY AS IT WERE
YOUR FRIEND IS SPENDING HER VACATION IN TRAVELLING I HEAR
FRIEND FORSOOTH THOUGHT I TO MYSELF BUT IT WOULD NOT DO TO
CONTRADICT HE MUST HAVE HIS OWN WAY I MUST OWN THE SOFT IMPEACHMENT
FRIEND LET IT BE
STILL BY WAY OF EXPERIMENT I COULD NOT HELP ASKING
WHOM HE MEANT
HE HAD TAKEN A SEAT AT MY WORK TABLE HE NOW LAID HANDS ON A REEL OF
THREAD WHICH HE PROCEEDED RECKLESSLY TO UNWIND
GINEVRA MISS FANSHAWE HAS ACCOMPANIED THE CHOLMONDELEYS ON A TOUR
THROUGH THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
SHE HAS
DO YOU AND SHE CORRESPOND
IT WILL ASTONISH YOU TO HEAR THAT I NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF MAKING
APPLICATION FOR THAT PRIVILEGE
YOU HAVE SEEN LETTERS OF HER WRITING
YES SEVERAL TO HER UNCLE
THEY WILL NOT BE DEFICIENT IN WIT AND NAVET THERE IS SO MUCH
SPARKLE AND SO LITTLE ART IN HER SOUL
SHE WRITES COMPREHENSIVELY ENOUGH WHEN SHE WRITES TO M
DE
BASSOMPIERRE HE WHO RUNS MAY READ IN FACT GINEVRA'S EPISTLES TO
HER WEALTHY KINSMAN WERE COMMONLY BUSINESS DOCUMENTS UNEQUIVOCAL
APPLICATIONS FOR CASH
AND HER HANDWRITING IT MUST BE PRETTY LIGHT LADYLIKE I SHOULD
THINK
IT WAS AND I SAID SO
I VERILY BELIEVE THAT ALL SHE DOES IS WELL DONE SAID DR
JOHN AND
AS I SEEMED IN NO HURRY TO CHIME IN WITH THIS REMARK HE ADDED YOU
WHO KNOW HER COULD YOU NAME A POINT IN WHICH SHE IS DEFICIENT
SHE DOES SEVERAL THINGS VERY WELL FLIRTATION AMONGST THE REST
SUBJOINED I IN THOUGHT
WHEN DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE WILL RETURN TO TOWN HE SOON INQUIRED
PARDON ME DR
JOHN I MUST EXPLAIN
YOU HONOUR ME TOO MUCH IN
ASCRIBING TO ME A DEGREE OF INTIMACY WITH MISS FANSHAWE I HAVE NOT THE
FELICITY TO ENJOY
I HAVE NEVER BEEN THE DEPOSITARY OF HER PLANS AND
SECRETS
YOU WILL FIND HER PARTICULAR FRIENDS IN ANOTHER SPHERE THAN
MINE AMONGST THE CHOLMONDELEYS FOR INSTANCE
HE ACTUALLY THOUGHT I WAS STUNG WITH A KIND OF JEALOUS PAIN SIMILAR TO
HIS OWN
EXCUSE HER HE SAID JUDGE HER INDULGENTLY THE GLITTER OF FASHION
MISLEADS HER BUT SHE WILL SOON FIND OUT THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE HOLLOW
AND WILL RETURN TO YOU WITH AUGMENTED ATTACHMENT AND CONFIRMED TRUST
I
KNOW SOMETHING OF THE CHOLMONDELEYS SUPERFICIAL SHOWY SELFISH
PEOPLE DEPEND ON IT AT HEART GINEVRA VALUES YOU BEYOND A SCORE OF
SUCH
YOU ARE VERY KIND I SAID BRIEFLY
A DISCLAIMER OF THE SENTIMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO ME BURNED ON MY LIPS BUT
I EXTINGUISHED THE FLAME
I SUBMITTED TO BE LOOKED UPON AS THE
HUMILIATED CAST OFF AND NOW PINING CONFIDANTE OF THE DISTINGUISHED
MISS FANSHAWE BUT READER IT WAS A HARD SUBMISSION
YET YOU SEE CONTINUED GRAHAM WHILE I COMFORT YOU I CANNOT TAKE
THE SAME CONSOLATION TO MYSELF I CANNOT HOPE SHE WILL DO ME JUSTICE
DE HAMAL IS MOST WORTHLESS YET I FEAR HE PLEASES HER WRETCHED
DELUSION
MY PATIENCE REALLY GAVE WAY AND WITHOUT NOTICE ALL AT ONCE
I SUPPOSE
ILLNESS AND WEAKNESS HAD WORN IT AND MADE IT BRITTLE
DR
BRETTON I BROKE OUT THERE IS NO DELUSION LIKE YOUR OWN
ON ALL
POINTS BUT ONE YOU ARE A MAN FRANK HEALTHFUL RIGHT THINKING
CLEAR SIGHTED ON THIS EXCEPTIONAL POINT YOU ARE BUT A SLAVE
I
DECLARE WHERE MISS FANSHAWE IS CONCERNED YOU MERIT NO RESPECT NOR
HAVE YOU MINE
I GOT UP AND LEFT THE ROOM VERY MUCH EXCITED
THIS LITTLE SCENE TOOK PLACE IN THE MORNING I HAD TO MEET HIM AGAIN IN
THE EVENING AND THEN I SAW I HAD DONE MISCHIEF
HE WAS NOT MADE OF
COMMON CLAY NOT PUT TOGETHER OUT OF VULGAR MATERIALS WHILE THE
OUTLINES OF HIS NATURE HAD BEEN SHAPED WITH BREADTH AND VIGOUR THE
DETAILS EMBRACED WORKMANSHIP OF ALMOST FEMININE DELICACY FINER MUCH
FINER THAN YOU COULD BE PREPARED TO MEET WITH THAN YOU COULD BELIEVE
INHERENT IN HIM EVEN AFTER YEARS OF ACQUAINTANCE
INDEED TILL SOME
OVER SHARP CONTACT WITH HIS NERVES HAD BETRAYED BY ITS EFFECTS THEIR
ACUTE SENSIBILITY THIS ELABORATE CONSTRUCTION MUST BE IGNORED AND THE
MORE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE SYMPATHETIC FACULTY WAS NOT PROMINENT IN
HIM TO FEEL AND TO SEIZE QUICKLY ANOTHER'S FEELINGS ARE SEPARATE
PROPERTIES A FEW CONSTRUCTIONS POSSESS BOTH SOME NEITHER
DR
JOHN
HAD THE ONE IN EXQUISITE PERFECTION AND BECAUSE I HAVE ADMITTED THAT
HE WAS NOT ENDOWED WITH THE OTHER IN EQUAL DEGREE THE READER WILL
CONSIDERATELY REFRAIN FROM PASSING TO AN EXTREME AND PRONOUNCING HIM
UN SYMPATHIZING UNFEELING ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS A KIND GENEROUS
MAN
MAKE YOUR NEED KNOWN HIS HAND WAS OPEN
PUT YOUR GRIEF INTO
WORDS HE TURNED NO DEAF EAR
EXPECT REFINEMENTS OF PERCEPTION
MIRACLES OF INTUITION AND REALIZE DISAPPOINTMENT
THIS NIGHT WHEN DR
JOHN ENTERED THE ROOM AND MET THE EVENING LAMP I SAW WELL AND AT ONE
GLANCE HIS WHOLE MECHANISM
TO ONE WHO HAD NAMED HIM SLAVE AND ON ANY POINT BANNED HIM FROM
RESPECT HE MUST NOW HAVE PECULIAR FEELINGS
THAT THE EPITHET WAS WELL
APPLIED AND THE BAN JUST MIGHT BE HE PUT FORTH NO DENIAL THAT IT WAS
SO HIS MIND EVEN CANDIDLY REVOLVED THAT UNMANNING POSSIBILITY
HE
SOUGHT IN THIS ACCUSATION THE CAUSE OF THAT ILL SUCCESS WHICH HAD GOT
SO GALLING A HOLD ON HIS MENTAL PEACE AMID THE WORRY OF A
SELF CONDEMNATORY SOLILOQUY HIS DEMEANOUR SEEMED GRAVE PERHAPS COLD
BOTH TO ME AND HIS MOTHER
AND YET THERE WAS NO BAD FEELING NO MALICE
NO RANCOUR NO LITTLENESS IN HIS COUNTENANCE BEAUTIFUL WITH A MAN'S
BEST BEAUTY EVEN IN ITS DEPRESSION
WHEN I PLACED HIS CHAIR AT THE
TABLE WHICH I HASTENED TO DO ANTICIPATING THE SERVANT AND WHEN I
HANDED HIM HIS TEA WHICH I DID WITH TREMBLING CARE HE SAID THANK
YOU LUCY IN AS KINDLY A TONE OF HIS FULL PLEASANT VOICE AS EVER MY
EAR WELCOMED
FOR MY PART THERE WAS ONLY ONE PLAN TO BE PURSUED I MUST EXPIATE MY
CULPABLE VEHEMENCE OR I MUST NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT
THIS WOULD NOT DO
AT ALL I COULD NOT STAND IT I MADE NO PRETENCE OF CAPACITY TO WAGE
WAR ON THIS FOOTING
SCHOOL SOLITUDE CONVENTUAL SILENCE AND
STAGNATION ANYTHING SEEMED PREFERABLE TO LIVING EMBROILED WITH DR
JOHN
AS TO GINEVRA SHE MIGHT TAKE THE SILVER WINGS OF A DOVE OR ANY
OTHER FOWL THAT FLIES AND MOUNT STRAIGHT UP TO THE HIGHEST PLACE
AMONG THE HIGHEST STARS WHERE HER LOVER'S HIGHEST FLIGHT OF FANCY
CHOSE TO FIX THE CONSTELLATION OF HER CHARMS NEVER MORE BE IT MINE TO
DISPUTE THE ARRANGEMENT
LONG I TRIED TO CATCH HIS EYE
AGAIN AND AGAIN
THAT EYE JUST MET MINE BUT HAVING NOTHING TO SAY IT WITHDREW AND I
WAS BAFFLED
AFTER TEA HE SAT SAD AND QUIET READING A BOOK
I WISHED
I COULD HAVE DARED TO GO AND SIT NEAR HIM BUT IT SEEMED THAT IF I
VENTURED TO TAKE THAT STEP HE WOULD INFALLIBLY EVINCE HOSTILITY AND
INDIGNATION
I LONGED TO SPEAK OUT AND I DARED NOT WHISPER
HIS MOTHER
LEFT THE ROOM THEN MOVED BY INSUPPORTABLE REGRET I JUST MURMURED THE
WORDS DR
BRETTON
HE LOOKED UP FROM HIS BOOK HIS EYES WERE NOT COLD OR MALEVOLENT HIS
MOUTH WAS NOT CYNICAL HE WAS READY AND WILLING TO HEAR WHAT I MIGHT
HAVE TO SAY HIS SPIRIT WAS OF VINTAGE TOO MELLOW AND GENEROUS TO SOUR
IN ONE THUNDER CLAP
DR
BRETTON FORGIVE MY HASTY WORDS DO DO FORGIVE THEM
HE SMILED THAT MOMENT I SPOKE
PERHAPS I DESERVED THEM LUCY
IF YOU
DON'T RESPECT ME I AM SURE IT IS BECAUSE I AM NOT RESPECTABLE
I FEAR
I AM AN AWKWARD FOOL I MUST MANAGE BADLY IN SOME WAY FOR WHERE I WISH
TO PLEASE IT SEEMS I DON'T PLEASE
OF THAT YOU CANNOT BE SURE AND EVEN IF SUCH BE THE CASE IS IT THE
FAULT OF YOUR CHARACTER OR OF ANOTHER'S PERCEPTIONS BUT NOW LET ME
UNSAY WHAT I SAID IN ANGER
IN ONE THING AND IN ALL THINGS I DEEPLY
RESPECT YOU
IF YOU THINK SCARCELY ENOUGH OF YOURSELF AND TOO MUCH OF
OTHERS WHAT IS THAT BUT AN EXCELLENCE
CAN I THINK TOO MUCH OF GINEVRA
I BELIEVE YOU MAY YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN'T
LET US AGREE TO DIFFER
LET ME BE PARDONED THAT IS WHAT I ASK
DO YOU THINK I CHERISH ILL WILL FOR ONE WARM WORD
I SEE YOU DO NOT AND CANNOT BUT JUST SAY 'LUCY I FORGIVE YOU SAY
THAT TO EASE ME OF THE HEART ACHE
PUT AWAY YOUR HEART ACHE AS I WILL PUT AWAY MINE FOR YOU WOUNDED ME
A LITTLE LUCY
NOW WHEN THE PAIN IS GONE I MORE THAN FORGIVE I FEEL
GRATEFUL AS TO A SINCERE WELL WISHER
I AM YOUR SINCERE WELL WISHER YOU ARE RIGHT
THUS OUR QUARREL ENDED
READER IF IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK YOU FIND THAT MY OPINION OF DR
JOHN UNDERGOES MODIFICATION EXCUSE THE SEEMING INCONSISTENCY
I GIVE
THE FEELING AS AT THE TIME I FELT IT I DESCRIBE THE VIEW OF CHARACTER
AS IT APPEARED WHEN DISCOVERED
HE SHOWED THE FINENESS OF HIS NATURE BY BEING KINDER TO ME AFTER THAT
MISUNDERSTANDING THAN BEFORE
NAY THE VERY INCIDENT WHICH BY MY
THEORY MUST IN SOME DEGREE ESTRANGE ME AND HIM CHANGED INDEED
SOMEWHAT OUR RELATIONS BUT NOT IN THE SENSE I PAINFULLY ANTICIPATED
AN INVISIBLE BUT A COLD SOMETHING VERY SLIGHT VERY TRANSPARENT BUT
VERY CHILL A SORT OF SCREEN OF ICE HAD HITHERTO ALL THROUGH OUR TWO
LIVES GLAZED THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH WE EXCHANGED INTERCOURSE
THOSE
FEW WARM WORDS THOUGH ONLY WARM WITH ANGER BREATHED ON THAT FRAIL
FROST WORK OF RESERVE ABOUT THIS TIME IT GAVE NOTE OF DISSOLUTION
I
THINK FROM THAT DAY SO LONG AS WE CONTINUED FRIENDS HE NEVER IN
DISCOURSE STOOD ON TOPICS OF CEREMONY WITH ME
HE SEEMED TO KNOW THAT
IF HE WOULD BUT TALK ABOUT HIMSELF AND ABOUT THAT IN WHICH HE WAS MOST
INTERESTED MY EXPECTATION WOULD ALWAYS BE ANSWERED MY WISH ALWAYS
SATISFIED
IT FOLLOWS AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT I CONTINUED TO HEAR
MUCH OF GINEVRA
GINEVRA HE THOUGHT HER SO FAIR SO GOOD HE SPOKE SO LOVINGLY OF HER
CHARMS HER SWEETNESS HER INNOCENCE THAT IN SPITE OF MY PLAIN PROSE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE REALITY A KIND OF REFLECTED GLOW BEGAN TO SETTLE ON
HER IDEA EVEN FOR ME
STILL READER I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT HE
OFTEN TALKED NONSENSE BUT I STROVE TO BE UNFAILINGLY PATIENT WITH HIM
I HAD HAD MY LESSON I HAD LEARNED HOW SEVERE FOR ME WAS THE PAIN OF
CROSSING OR GRIEVING OR DISAPPOINTING HIM
IN A STRANGE AND NEW
SENSE I GREW MOST SELFISH AND QUITE POWERLESS TO DENY MYSELF THE
DELIGHT OF INDULGING HIS MOOD AND BEING PLIANT TO HIS WILL
HE STILL
SEEMED TO ME MOST ABSURD WHEN HE OBSTINATELY DOUBTED AND DESPONDED
ABOUT HIS POWER TO WIN IN THE END MISS FANSHAWE'S PREFERENCE
THE FANCY
BECAME ROOTED IN MY OWN MIND MORE STUBBORNLY THAN EVER THAT SHE WAS
ONLY COQUETTING TO GOAD HIM AND THAT AT HEART SHE COVETED EVERYONE
OF HIS WORDS AND LOOKS
SOMETIMES HE HARASSED ME IN SPITE OF MY
RESOLUTION TO BEAR AND HEAR IN THE MIDST OF THE INDESCRIBABLE
GALL HONEY PLEASURE OF THUS BEARING AND HEARING HE STRUCK SO ON THE
FLINT OF WHAT FIRMNESS I OWNED THAT IT EMITTED FIRE ONCE AND AGAIN
I
CHANCED TO ASSERT ONE DAY WITH A VIEW TO STILLING HIS IMPATIENCE THAT
IN MY OWN MIND I FELT POSITIVE MISS FANSHAWE MUST INTEND EVENTUALLY
TO ACCEPT HIM
POSITIVE IT WAS EASY TO SAY SO BUT HAD I ANY GROUNDS FOR SUCH
ASSURANCE
THE BEST GROUNDS
NOW LUCY DO TELL ME WHAT
YOU KNOW THEM AS WELL AS I AND KNOWING THEM DR
JOHN IT REALLY
AMAZES ME THAT YOU SHOULD NOT REPOSE THE FRANKEST CONFIDENCE IN HER
FIDELITY
TO DOUBT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IS ALMOST TO INSULT
NOW YOU ARE BEGINNING TO SPEAK FAST AND TO BREATHE SHORT BUT SPEAK A
LITTLE FASTER AND BREATHE A LITTLE SHORTER TILL YOU HAVE GIVEN AN
EXPLANATION A FULL EXPLANATION I MUST HAVE IT
YOU SHALL DR
JOHN
IN SOME CASES YOU ARE A LAVISH GENEROUS MAN
YOU ARE A WORSHIPPER EVER READY WITH THE VOTIVE OFFERING SHOULD PRE
SILAS EVER CONVERT YOU YOU WILL GIVE HIM ABUNDANCE OF ALMS FOR HIS
POOR YOU WILL SUPPLY HIS ALTAR WITH TAPERS AND THE SHRINE OF YOUR
FAVOURITE SAINT YOU WILL DO YOUR BEST TO ENRICH GINEVRA DR
JOHN
HUSH SAID HE DON'T GO ON
HUSH I WILL NOT AND GO ON I WILL GINEVRA HAS HAD HER HANDS
FILLED FROM YOUR HANDS MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT
YOU HAVE SOUGHT FOR
HER THE COSTLIEST FLOWERS YOU HAVE BUSIED YOUR BRAIN IN DEVISING GIFTS
THE MOST DELICATE SUCH ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AS ONLY A WOMAN COULD
HAVE IMAGINED AND IN ADDITION MISS FANSHAWE OWNS A SET OF ORNAMENTS
TO PURCHASE WHICH YOUR GENEROSITY MUST HAVE VERGED ON EXTRAVAGANCE
THE MODESTY GINEVRA HERSELF HAD NEVER EVINCED IN THIS MATTER NOW
FLUSHED ALL OVER THE FACE OF HER ADMIRER
NONSENSE HE SAID DESTRUCTIVELY SNIPPING A SKEIN OF SILK WITH MY
SCISSORS
I OFFERED THEM TO PLEASE MYSELF I FELT SHE DID ME A FAVOUR
IN ACCEPTING THEM
SHE DID MORE THAN A FAVOUR DR
JOHN SHE PLEDGED HER VERY HONOUR THAT
SHE WOULD MAKE YOU SOME RETURN AND IF SHE CANNOT PAY YOU IN AFFECTION
SHE OUGHT TO HAND OUT A BUSINESS LIKE EQUIVALENT IN THE SHAPE OF SOME
ROULEAUX OF GOLD PIECES
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HER SHE IS FAR TOO DISINTERESTED TO CARE FOR
MY GIFTS AND TOO SIMPLE MINDED TO KNOW THEIR VALUE
I LAUGHED OUT I HAD HEARD HER ADJUDGE TO EVERY JEWEL ITS PRICE AND
WELL I KNEW MONEY EMBARRASSMENT MONEY SCHEMES MONEY'S WORTH AND
ENDEAVOURS TO REALISE SUPPLIES HAD YOUNG AS SHE WAS FURNISHED THE
MOST FREQUENT AND THE FAVOURITE STIMULUS OF HER THOUGHTS FOR YEARS
HE PURSUED
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER WHENEVER I HAVE LAID ON HER LAP
SOME TRIFLE SO COOL SO UNMOVED NO EAGERNESS TO TAKE NOT EVEN
PLEASURE IN CONTEMPLATING
JUST FROM AMIABLE RELUCTANCE TO GRIEVE ME
SHE WOULD PERMIT THE BOUQUET TO LIE BESIDE HER AND PERHAPS CONSENT TO
BEAR IT AWAY
OR IF I ACHIEVED THE FASTENING OF A BRACELET ON HER
IVORY ARM HOWEVER PRETTY THE TRINKET MIGHT BE AND I ALWAYS CAREFULLY
CHOSE WHAT SEEMED TO ME PRETTY AND WHAT OF COURSE WAS NOT
VALUELESS THE GLITTER NEVER DAZZLED HER BRIGHT EYES SHE WOULD HARDLY
CAST ONE LOOK ON MY GIFT
THEN OF COURSE NOT VALUING IT SHE WOULD UNLOOSE AND RETURN IT TO
YOU
NO FOR SUCH A REPULSE SHE WAS TOO GOOD NATURED
SHE WOULD CONSENT TO
SEEM TO FORGET WHAT I HAD DONE AND RETAIN THE OFFERING WITH LADY LIKE
QUIET AND EASY OBLIVION
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES HOW CAN A MAN BUILD
ON ACCEPTANCE OF HIS PRESENTS AS A FAVOURABLE SYMPTOM FOR MY PART
WERE I TO OFFER HER ALL I HAVE AND SHE TO TAKE IT SUCH IS HER
INCAPACITY TO BE SWAYED BY SORDID CONSIDERATIONS I SHOULD NOT VENTURE
TO BELIEVE THE TRANSACTION ADVANCED ME ONE STEP
DR
JOHN I BEGAN LOVE IS BLIND BUT JUST THEN A BLUE SUBTLE RAY
SPED SIDEWAYS FROM DR
JOHN'S EYE IT REMINDED ME OF OLD DAYS IT
REMINDED ME OF HIS PICTURE IT HALF LED ME TO THINK THAT PART AT
LEAST OF HIS PROFESSED PERSUASION OF MISS FANSHAWE'S NAVET WAS
ASSUMED IT LED ME DUBIOUSLY TO CONJECTURE THAT PERHAPS IN SPITE OF
HIS PASSION FOR HER BEAUTY HIS APPRECIATION OF HER FOIBLES MIGHT
POSSIBLY BE LESS MISTAKEN MORE CLEAR SIGHTED THAN FROM HIS GENERAL
LANGUAGE WAS PRESUMABLE
AFTER ALL IT MIGHT BE ONLY A CHANCE LOOK OR
AT BEST THE TOKEN OF A MERELY MOMENTARY IMPRESSION
CHANCE OR
INTENTIONAL REAL OR IMAGINARY IT CLOSED THE CONVERSATION
CHAPTER XIX
THE CLEOPATRA
MY STAY AT LA TERRASSE WAS PROLONGED A FORTNIGHT BEYOND THE CLOSE OF
THE VACATION
MRS
BRETTON'S KIND MANAGEMENT PROCURED ME THIS RESPITE
HER SON HAVING ONE DAY DELIVERED THE DICTUM THAT LUCY WAS NOT YET
STRONG ENOUGH TO GO BACK TO THAT DEN OF A PENSIONNAT SHE AT ONCE
DROVE OVER TO THE RUE FOSSETTE HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DIRECTRESS
AND PROCURED THE INDULGENCE ON THE PLEA OF PROLONGED REST AND CHANGE
BEING NECESSARY TO PERFECT RECOVERY
HEREUPON HOWEVER FOLLOWED AN
ATTENTION I COULD VERY WELL HAVE DISPENSED WITH VIZ A POLITE CALL
FROM MADAME BECK
THAT LADY ONE FINE DAY ACTUALLY CAME OUT IN A FIACRE AS FAR AS THE
CHTEAU
I SUPPOSE SHE HAD RESOLVED WITHIN HERSELF TO SEE WHAT MANNER
OF PLACE DR
JOHN INHABITED
APPARENTLY THE PLEASANT SITE AND NEAT
INTERIOR SURPASSED HER EXPECTATIONS SHE EULOGIZED ALL SHE SAW
PRONOUNCED THE BLUE SALON UNE PICE MAGNIFIQUE PROFUSELY
CONGRATULATED ME ON THE ACQUISITION OF FRIENDS TELLEMENT DIGNES
AIMABLES ET RESPECTABLES TURNED ALSO A NEAT COMPLIMENT IN MY FAVOUR
AND UPON DR
JOHN COMING IN RAN UP TO HIM WITH THE UTMOST BUOYANCY
OPENING AT THE SAME TIME SUCH A FIRE OF RAPID LANGUAGE ALL SPARKLING
WITH FELICITATIONS AND PROTESTATIONS ABOUT HIS CHTEAU MADAME SA
MRE LA DIGNE CHTELAINE ALSO HIS LOOKS WHICH INDEED WERE VERY
FLOURISHING AND AT THE MOMENT ADDITIONALLY EMBELLISHED BY THE
GOOD NATURED BUT AMUSED SMILE WITH WHICH HE ALWAYS LISTENED TO MADAME'S
FLUENT AND FLORID FRENCH
IN SHORT MADAME SHONE IN HER VERY BEST PHASE
THAT DAY AND CAME IN AND WENT OUT QUITE A LIVING CATHERINE WHEEL OF
COMPLIMENTS DELIGHT AND AFFABILITY
HALF PURPOSELY AND HALF TO ASK
SOME QUESTION ABOUT SCHOOL BUSINESS I FOLLOWED HER TO THE CARRIAGE
AND LOOKED IN AFTER SHE WAS SEATED AND THE DOOR CLOSED
IN THAT BRIEF
FRACTION OF TIME WHAT A CHANGE HAD BEEN WROUGHT AN INSTANT AGO ALL
SPARKLES AND JESTS SHE NOW SAT STERNER THAN A JUDGE AND GRAVER THAN A
SAGE
STRANGE LITTLE WOMAN
I WENT BACK AND TEASED DR
JOHN ABOUT MADAME'S DEVOTION TO HIM
HOW HE
LAUGHED WHAT FUN SHONE IN HIS EYES AS HE RECALLED SOME OF HER FINE
SPEECHES AND REPEATED THEM IMITATING HER VOLUBLE DELIVERY HE HAD AN
ACUTE SENSE OF HUMOUR AND WAS THE FINEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD WHEN HE
COULD FORGET MISS FANSHAWE
TO SIT IN SUNSHINE CALM AND SWEET IS SAID TO BE EXCELLENT FOR WEAK
PEOPLE IT GIVES THEM VITAL FORCE
WHEN LITTLE GEORGETTE BECK WAS
RECOVERING FROM HER ILLNESS I USED TO TAKE HER IN MY ARMS AND WALK
WITH HER IN THE GARDEN BY THE HOUR TOGETHER BENEATH A CERTAIN WALL
HUNG WITH GRAPES WHICH THE SOUTHERN SUN WAS RIPENING THAT SUN
CHERISHED HER LITTLE PALE FRAME QUITE AS EFFECTUALLY AS IT MELLOWED AND
SWELLED THE CLUSTERING FRUIT
THERE ARE HUMAN TEMPERS BLAND GLOWING AND GENIAL WITHIN WHOSE
INFLUENCE IT IS AS GOOD FOR THE POOR IN SPIRIT TO LIVE AS IT IS FOR
THE FEEBLE IN FRAME TO BASK IN THE GLOW OF NOON
OF THE NUMBER OF THESE
CHOICE NATURES WERE CERTAINLY BOTH DR
BRETTON'S AND HIS MOTHER'S
THEY
LIKED TO COMMUNICATE HAPPINESS AS SOME LIKE TO OCCASION MISERY THEY
DID IT INSTINCTIVELY WITHOUT FUSS AND APPARENTLY WITH LITTLE
CONSCIOUSNESS THE MEANS TO GIVE PLEASURE ROSE SPONTANEOUSLY IN THEIR
MINDS
EVERY DAY WHILE I STAYED WITH THEM SOME LITTLE PLAN WAS
PROPOSED WHICH RESULTED IN BENEFICIAL ENJOYMENT
FULLY OCCUPIED AS WAS
DR
JOHN'S TIME HE STILL MADE IT IN HIS WAY TO ACCOMPANY US IN EACH
BRIEF EXCURSION
I CAN HARDLY TELL HOW HE MANAGED HIS ENGAGEMENTS THEY
WERE NUMEROUS YET BY DINT OF SYSTEM HE CLASSED THEM IN AN ORDER WHICH
LEFT HIM A DAILY PERIOD OF LIBERTY
I OFTEN SAW HIM HARD WORKED YET
SELDOM OVER DRIVEN AND NEVER IRRITATED CONFUSED OR OPPRESSED
WHAT
HE DID WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE EASE AND GRACE OF ALL SUFFICING
STRENGTH WITH THE BOUNTIFUL CHEERFULNESS OF HIGH AND UNBROKEN
ENERGIES
UNDER HIS GUIDANCE I SAW IN THAT ONE HAPPY FORTNIGHT MORE
OF VILLETTE ITS ENVIRONS AND ITS INHABITANTS THAN I HAD SEEN IN THE
WHOLE EIGHT MONTHS OF MY PREVIOUS RESIDENCE
HE TOOK ME TO PLACES OF
INTEREST IN THE TOWN OF WHOSE NAMES I HAD NOT BEFORE SO MUCH AS HEARD
WITH WILLINGNESS AND SPIRIT HE COMMUNICATES MUCH NOTEWORTHY
INFORMATION
HE NEVER SEEMED TO THINK IT A TROUBLE TO TALK TO ME AND
I AM SURE IT WAS NEVER A TASK TO ME TO LISTEN
IT WAS NOT HIS WAY TO
TREAT SUBJECTS COLDLY AND VAGUELY HE RARELY GENERALIZED NEVER PROSED
HE SEEMED TO LIKE NICE DETAILS ALMOST AS MUCH AS I LIKED THEM MYSELF
HE SEEMED OBSERVANT OF CHARACTER AND NOT SUPERFICIALLY OBSERVANT
EITHER
THESE POINTS GAVE THE QUALITY OF INTEREST TO HIS DISCOURSE AND
THE FACT OF HIS SPEAKING DIRECT FROM HIS OWN RESOURCES AND NOT
BORROWING OR STEALING FROM BOOKS HERE A DRY FACT AND THERE A TRITE
PHRASE AND ELSEWHERE A HACKNEYED OPINION ENSURED A FRESHNESS AS
WELCOME AS IT WAS RARE
BEFORE MY EYES TOO HIS DISPOSITION SEEMED TO
UNFOLD ANOTHER PHASE TO PASS TO A FRESH DAY TO RISE IN NEW AND NOBLER
DAWN
HIS MOTHER POSSESSED A GOOD DEVELOPMENT OF BENEVOLENCE BUT HE OWNED A
BETTER AND LARGER
I FOUND ON ACCOMPANYING HIM TO THE BASSE VILLE THE
POOR AND CROWDED QUARTER OF THE CITY THAT HIS ERRANDS THERE WERE AS
MUCH THOSE OF THE PHILANTHROPIST AS THE PHYSICIAN
I UNDERSTOOD
PRESENTLY THAT CHEERFULLY HABITUALLY AND IN SINGLE MINDED
UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF ANY SPECIAL MERIT DISTINGUISHING HIS DEEDS HE WAS
ACHIEVING AMONGST A VERY WRETCHED POPULATION A WORLD OF ACTIVE GOOD
THE LOWER ORDERS LIKED HIM WELL HIS POOR PATIENTS IN THE HOSPITALS
WELCOMED HIM WITH A SORT OF ENTHUSIASM
BUT STOP I MUST NOT FROM THE FAITHFUL NARRATOR DEGENERATE INTO THE
PARTIAL EULOGIST
WELL FULL WELL DO I KNOW THAT DR
JOHN WAS NOT
PERFECT ANYMORE THAN I AM PERFECT
HUMAN FALLIBILITY LEAVENED HIM
THROUGHOUT THERE WAS NO HOUR AND SCARCELY A MOMENT OF THE TIME I
SPENT WITH HIM THAT IN ACT OR SPEECH OR LOOK HE DID NOT BETRAY
SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT OF A GOD
A GOD COULD NOT HAVE THE CRUEL VANITY
OF DR
JOHN NOR HIS SOMETIME LEVITY NO IMMORTAL COULD HAVE RESEMBLED
HIM IN HIS OCCASIONAL TEMPORARY OBLIVION OF ALL BUT THE PRESENT IN HIS
PASSING PASSION FOR THAT PRESENT SHOWN NOT COARSELY BY DEVOTING IT TO
MATERIAL INDULGENCE BUT SELFISHLY BY EXTRACTING FROM IT WHATEVER IT
COULD YIELD OF NUTRIMENT TO HIS MASCULINE SELF LOVE HIS DELIGHT WAS TO
FEED THAT RAVENOUS SENTIMENT WITHOUT THOUGHT OF THE PRICE OF
PROVENDER OR CARE FOR THE COST OF KEEPING IT SLEEK AND HIGH PAMPERED
THE READER IS REQUESTED TO NOTE A SEEMING CONTRADICTION IN THE TWO
VIEWS WHICH HAVE BEEN GIVEN OF GRAHAM BRETTON THE PUBLIC AND
PRIVATE THE OUT DOOR AND THE IN DOOR VIEW
IN THE FIRST THE PUBLIC
HE IS SHOWN OBLIVIOUS OF SELF AS MODEST IN THE DISPLAY OF HIS
ENERGIES AS EARNEST IN THEIR EXERCISE
IN THE SECOND THE FIRESIDE
PICTURE THERE IS EXPRESSED CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHAT HE HAS AND WHAT HE
IS PLEASURE IN HOMAGE SOME RECKLESSNESS IN EXCITING SOME VANITY IN
RECEIVING THE SAME
BOTH PORTRAITS ARE CORRECT
IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO OBLIGE DR
JOHN QUIETLY AND IN SECRET
WHEN
YOU THOUGHT THAT THE FABRICATION OF SOME TRIFLE DEDICATED TO HIS USE
HAD BEEN ACHIEVED UNNOTICED AND THAT LIKE OTHER MEN HE WOULD USE IT
WHEN PLACED READY FOR HIS USE AND NEVER ASK WHENCE IT CAME HE AMAZED
YOU BY A SMILINGLY UTTERED OBSERVATION OR TWO PROVING THAT HIS EYE HAD
BEEN ON THE WORK FROM COMMENCEMENT TO CLOSE THAT HE HAD NOTED THE
DESIGN TRACED ITS PROGRESS AND MARKED ITS COMPLETION
IT PLEASED HIM
TO BE THUS SERVED AND HE LET HIS PLEASURE BEAM IN HIS EYE AND PLAY
ABOUT HIS MOUTH
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL VERY WELL IF HE HAD NOT ADDED TO SUCH KINDLY
AND UNOBTRUSIVE EVIDENCE A CERTAIN WILFULNESS IN DISCHARGING WHAT HE
CALLED DEBTS
WHEN HIS MOTHER WORKED FOR HIM HE PAID HER BY SHOWERING
ABOUT HER HIS BRIGHT ANIMAL SPIRITS WITH EVEN MORE AFFLUENCE THAN HIS
GAY TAUNTING TEASING LOVING WONT
IF LUCY SNOWE WERE DISCOVERED TO
HAVE PUT HER HAND TO SUCH WORK HE PLANNED IN RECOMPENCE SOME
PLEASANT RECREATION
I OFTEN FELT AMAZED AT HIS PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF VILLETTE A KNOWLEDGE
NOT MERELY CONFINED TO ITS OPEN STREETS BUT PENETRATING TO ALL ITS
GALLERIES SALLES AND CABINETS OF EVERY DOOR WHICH SHUT IN AN OBJECT
WORTH SEEING OF EVERY MUSEUM OF EVERY HALL SACRED TO ART OR SCIENCE
HE SEEMED TO POSSESS THE OPEN SESAME I NEVER HAD A HEAD FOR
SCIENCE BUT AN IGNORANT BLIND FOND INSTINCT INCLINED ME TO ART
I
LIKED TO VISIT THE PICTURE GALLERIES AND I DEARLY LIKED TO BE LEFT
THERE ALONE
IN COMPANY A WRETCHED IDIOSYNCRACY FORBADE ME TO SEE MUCH
OR TO FEEL ANYTHING
IN UNFAMILIAR COMPANY WHERE IT WAS NECESSARY TO
MAINTAIN A FLOW OF TALK ON THE SUBJECTS IN PRESENCE HALF AN HOUR WOULD
KNOCK ME UP WITH A COMBINED PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL LASSITUDE AND ENTIRE
MENTAL INCAPACITY
I NEVER YET SAW THE WELL REARED CHILD MUCH LESS THE
EDUCATED ADULT WHO COULD NOT PUT ME TO SHAME BY THE SUSTAINED
INTELLIGENCE OF ITS DEMEANOUR UNDER THE ORDEAL OF A CONVERSABLE
SOCIABLE VISITATION OF PICTURES HISTORICAL SIGHTS OR BUILDINGS OR ANY
LIONS OF PUBLIC INTEREST
DR
BRETTON WAS A CICERONE AFTER MY OWN
HEART HE WOULD TAKE ME BETIMES ERE THE GALLERIES WERE FILLED LEAVE
ME THERE FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS AND CALL FOR ME WHEN HIS OWN
ENGAGEMENTS WERE DISCHARGED
MEANTIME I WAS HAPPY HAPPY NOT ALWAYS
IN ADMIRING BUT IN EXAMINING QUESTIONING AND FORMING CONCLUSIONS
IN
THE COMMENCEMENT OF THESE VISITS THERE WAS SOME MISUNDERSTANDING AND
CONSEQUENT STRUGGLE BETWEEN WILL AND POWER
THE FORMER FACULTY EXACTED
APPROBATION OF THAT WHICH IT WAS CONSIDERED ORTHODOX TO ADMIRE THE
LATTER GROANED FORTH ITS UTTER INABILITY TO PAY THE TAX IT WAS THEN
SELF SNEERED AT SPURRED UP GOADED ON TO REFINE ITS TASTE AND WHET
ITS ZEST
THE MORE IT WAS CHIDDEN HOWEVER THE MORE IT WOULDN'T
PRAISE
DISCOVERING GRADUALLY THAT A WONDERFUL SENSE OF FATIGUE
RESULTED FROM THESE CONSCIENTIOUS EFFORTS I BEGAN TO REFLECT WHETHER I
MIGHT NOT DISPENSE WITH THAT GREAT LABOUR AND CONCLUDED EVENTUALLY
THAT I MIGHT AND SO SANK SUPINE INTO A LUXURY OF CALM BEFORE
NINETY NINE OUT OF A HUNDRED OF THE EXHIBITED FRAMES
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT AN ORIGINAL AND GOOD PICTURE WAS JUST AS SCARCE AS
AN ORIGINAL AND GOOD BOOK NOR DID I IN THE END TREMBLE TO SAY TO
MYSELF STANDING BEFORE CERTAIN CHEF D'OEUVRES BEARING GREAT NAMES
THESE ARE NOT A WHIT LIKE NATURE
NATURE'S DAYLIGHT NEVER HAD THAT
COLOUR NEVER WAS MADE SO TURBID EITHER BY STORM OR CLOUD AS IT IS
LAID OUT THERE UNDER A SKY OF INDIGO AND THAT INDIGO IS NOT ETHER
AND THOSE DARK WEEDS PLASTERED UPON IT ARE NOT TREES SEVERAL VERY
WELL EXECUTED AND COMPLACENT LOOKING FAT WOMEN STRUCK ME AS BY NO MEANS
THE GODDESSES THEY APPEARED TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES
MANY SCORES OF
MARVELLOUSLY FINISHED LITTLE FLEMISH PICTURES AND ALSO OF SKETCHES
EXCELLENT FOR FASHION BOOKS DISPLAYING VARIED COSTUMES IN THE
HANDSOMEST MATERIALS GAVE EVIDENCE OF LAUDABLE INDUSTRY WHIMSICALLY
APPLIED
AND YET THERE WERE FRAGMENTS OF TRUTH HERE AND THERE WHICH
SATISFIED THE CONSCIENCE AND GLEAMS OF LIGHT THAT CHEERED THE VISION
NATURE'S POWER HERE BROKE THROUGH IN A MOUNTAIN SNOW STORM AND THERE
HER GLORY IN A SUNNY SOUTHERN DAY
AN EXPRESSION IN THIS PORTRAIT
PROVED CLEAR INSIGHT INTO CHARACTER A FACE IN THAT HISTORICAL
PAINTING BY ITS VIVID FILIAL LIKENESS STARTLINGLY REMINDED YOU THAT
GENIUS GAVE IT BIRTH
THESE EXCEPTIONS I LOVED THEY GREW DEAR AS
FRIENDS
ONE DAY AT A QUIET EARLY HOUR I FOUND MYSELF NEARLY ALONE IN A
CERTAIN GALLERY WHEREIN ONE PARTICULAR PICTURE OF PORTENTOUS SIZE SET
UP IN THE BEST LIGHT HAVING A CORDON OF PROTECTION STRETCHED BEFORE
IT AND A CUSHIONED BENCH DULY SET IN FRONT FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF
WORSHIPPING CONNOISSEURS WHO HAVING GAZED THEMSELVES OFF THEIR FEET
MIGHT BE FAIN TO COMPLETE THE BUSINESS SITTING THIS PICTURE I SAY
SEEMED TO CONSIDER ITSELF THE QUEEN OF THE COLLECTION
IT REPRESENTED A WOMAN CONSIDERABLY LARGER I THOUGHT THAN THE LIFE
I CALCULATED THAT THIS LADY PUT INTO A SCALE OF MAGNITUDE SUITABLE
FOR THE RECEPTION OF A COMMODITY OF BULK WOULD INFALLIBLY TURN FROM
FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN STONE
SHE WAS INDEED EXTREMELY WELL FED VERY
MUCH BUTCHER'S MEAT TO SAY NOTHING OF BREAD VEGETABLES AND
LIQUIDS MUST SHE HAVE CONSUMED TO ATTAIN THAT BREADTH AND HEIGHT THAT
WEALTH OF MUSCLE THAT AFFLUENCE OF FLESH
SHE LAY HALF RECLINED ON A
COUCH WHY IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY BROAD DAYLIGHT BLAZED ROUND
HER SHE APPEARED IN HEARTY HEALTH STRONG ENOUGH TO DO THE WORK OF TWO
PLAIN COOKS SHE COULD NOT PLEAD A WEAK SPINE SHE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
STANDING OR AT LEAST SITTING BOLT UPRIGHT
SHE HAD NO BUSINESS TO
LOUNGE AWAY THE NOON ON A SOFA
SHE OUGHT LIKEWISE TO HAVE WORN DECENT
GARMENTS A GOWN COVERING HER PROPERLY WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE OUT OF
ABUNDANCE OF MATERIAL SEVEN AND TWENTY YARDS I SHOULD SAY OF
DRAPERY SHE MANAGED TO MAKE INEFFICIENT RAIMENT
THEN FOR THE
WRETCHED UNTIDINESS SURROUNDING HER THERE COULD BE NO EXCUSE
POTS AND
PANS PERHAPS I OUGHT TO SAY VASES AND GOBLETS WERE ROLLED HERE AND
THERE ON THE FOREGROUND A PERFECT RUBBISH OF FLOWERS WAS MIXED AMONGST
THEM AND AN ABSURD AND DISORDERLY MASS OF CURTAIN UPHOLSTERY SMOTHERED
THE COUCH AND CUMBERED THE FLOOR
ON REFERRING TO THE CATALOGUE I
FOUND THAT THIS NOTABLE PRODUCTION BORE THE NAME CLEOPATRA
WELL I WAS SITTING WONDERING AT IT AS THE BENCH WAS THERE I THOUGHT
I MIGHT AS WELL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS ACCOMMODATION AND THINKING THAT
WHILE SOME OF THE DETAILS AS ROSES GOLD CUPS JEWELS C WERE VERY
PRETTILY PAINTED IT WAS ON THE WHOLE AN ENORMOUS PIECE OF CLAPTRAP
THE ROOM ALMOST VACANT WHEN I ENTERED BEGAN TO FILL
SCARCELY
NOTICING THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AS INDEED IT DID NOT MATTER TO ME I
RETAINED MY SEAT RATHER TO REST MYSELF THAN WITH A VIEW TO STUDYING
THIS HUGE DARK COMPLEXIONED GIPSY QUEEN OF WHOM INDEED I SOON
TIRED AND BETOOK MYSELF FOR REFRESHMENT TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF SOME
EXQUISITE LITTLE PICTURES OF STILL LIFE WILD FLOWERS WILD FRUIT
MOSSY WOODNESTS CASKETING EGGS THAT LOOKED LIKE PEARLS SEEN THROUGH
CLEAR GREEN SEA WATER ALL HUNG MODESTLY BENEATH THAT COARSE AND
PREPOSTEROUS CANVAS
SUDDENLY A LIGHT TAP VISITED MY SHOULDER
STARTING TURNING I MET A
FACE BENT TO ENCOUNTER MINE A FROWNING ALMOST A SHOCKED FACE IT WAS
QUE FAITES VOUS ICI SAID A VOICE
MAIS MONSIEUR JE M'AMUSE
VOUS VOUS AMUSEZ ET QUOI S'IL VOUS PLAIT MAIS D'ABORD FAITES MOI
LE PLAISIR DE VOUS LEVER PRENEZ MON BRAS ET ALLONS DE L'AUTRE CT
I DID PRECISELY AS I WAS BID

PAUL EMANUEL IT WAS HE RETURNED FROM
ROME AND NOW A TRAVELLED MAN WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE LESS TOLERANT OF
INSUBORDINATION NOW THAN BEFORE THIS ADDED DISTINCTION LAURELLED HIS
TEMPLES
PERMIT ME TO CONDUCT YOU TO YOUR PARTY SAID HE AS WE CROSSED THE
ROOM
I HAVE NO PARTY
YOU ARE NOT ALONE
YES MONSIEUR
DID YOU COME HERE UNACCOMPANIED
NO MONSIEUR
DR
BRETTON BROUGHT ME HERE
DR
BRETTON AND MADAME HIS MOTHER OF COURSE
NO ONLY DR
BRETTON
AND HE TOLD YOU TO LOOK AT THAT PICTURE
BY NO MEANS I FOUND IT OUT FOR MYSELF
M
PAUL'S HAIR WAS SHORN CLOSE AS RAVEN DOWN OR I THINK IT WOULD HAVE
BRISTLED ON HIS HEAD
BEGINNING NOW TO PERCEIVE HIS DRIFT I HAD A
CERTAIN PLEASURE IN KEEPING COOL AND WORKING HIM UP
ASTOUNDING INSULAR AUDACITY CRIED THE PROFESSOR
SINGULIRES FEMMES
QUE CES ANGLAISES
WHAT IS THE MATTER MONSIEUR
MATTER HOW DARE YOU A YOUNG PERSON SIT COOLLY DOWN WITH THE
SELF POSSESSION OF A GARON AND LOOK AT THAT PICTURE
IT IS A VERY UGLY PICTURE BUT I CANNOT AT ALL SEE WHY I SHOULD NOT
LOOK AT IT
BON BON SPEAK NO MORE OF IT
BUT YOU OUGHT NOT TO BE HERE ALONE
IF HOWEVER I HAVE NO SOCIETY NO PARTY AS YOU SAY AND THEN WHAT
DOES IT SIGNIFY WHETHER I AM ALONE OR ACCOMPANIED NOBODY MEDDLES WITH
ME
TAISEZ VOUS ET ASSEYEZ VOUS L L SETTING DOWN A CHAIR WITH
EMPHASIS IN A PARTICULARLY DULL CORNER BEFORE A SERIES OF MOST
SPECIALLY DREARY CADRES
MAIS MONSIEUR
MAIS MADEMOISELLE ASSEYEZ VOUS ET NE BOUGEZ
PAS ENTENDEZ VOUS JUSQU' CE QU'ON VIENNE VOUS CHERCHER OU QUE JE
VOUS DONNE LA PERMISSION
QUEL TRISTE COIN CRIED I ET QUELLES LAIDS TABLEAUX
AND LAIDS INDEED THEY WERE BEING A SET OF FOUR DENOMINATED IN THE
CATALOGUE LA VIE D'UNE FEMME THEY WERE PAINTED RATHER IN A
REMARKABLE STYLE FLAT DEAD PALE AND FORMAL
THE FIRST REPRESENTED A
JEUNE FILLE COMING OUT OF A CHURCH DOOR A MISSAL IN HER HAND HER
DRESS VERY PRIM HER EYES CAST DOWN HER MOUTH PURSED UP THE IMAGE OF
A MOST VILLANOUS LITTLE PRECOCIOUS SHE HYPOCRITE
THE SECOND A
MARIE WITH A LONG WHITE VEIL KNEELING AT A PRIE DIEU IN HER
CHAMBER HOLDING HER HANDS PLASTERED TOGETHER FINGER TO FINGER AND
SHOWING THE WHITES OF HER EYES IN A MOST EXASPERATING MANNER
THE
THIRD A JEUNE MRE HANGING DISCONSOLATE OVER A CLAYEY AND PUFFY
BABY WITH A FACE LIKE AN UNWHOLESOME FULL MOON
THE FOURTH A VEUVE
BEING A BLACK WOMAN HOLDING BY THE HAND A BLACK LITTLE GIRL AND THE
TWAIN STUDIOUSLY SURVEYING AN ELEGANT FRENCH MONUMENT SET UP IN A
CORNER OF SOME PRE LA CHAISE
ALL THESE FOUR ANGES WERE GRIM AND
GREY AS BURGLARS AND COLD AND VAPID AS GHOSTS
WHAT WOMEN TO LIVE
WITH INSINCERE ILL HUMOURED BLOODLESS BRAINLESS NONENTITIES AS BAD
IN THEIR WAY AS THE INDOLENT GIPSY GIANTESS THE CLEOPATRA IN HERS
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP ONE'S ATTENTION LONG CONFINED TO THESE
MASTER PIECES AND SO BY DEGREES I VEERED ROUND AND SURVEYED THE
GALLERY
A PERFECT CROWD OF SPECTATORS WAS BY THIS TIME GATHERED ROUND THE
LIONESS FROM WHOSE VICINAGE I HAD BEEN BANISHED NEARLY HALF THIS
CROWD WERE LADIES BUT M
PAUL AFTERWARDS TOLD ME THESE WERE DES
DAMES AND IT WAS QUITE PROPER FOR THEM TO CONTEMPLATE WHAT NO
DEMOISELLE OUGHT TO GLANCE AT
I ASSURED HIM PLAINLY I COULD NOT
AGREE IN THIS DOCTRINE AND DID NOT SEE THE SENSE OF IT WHEREUPON
WITH HIS USUAL ABSOLUTISM HE MERELY REQUESTED MY SILENCE AND ALSO IN
THE SAME BREATH DENOUNCED MY MINGLED RASHNESS AND IGNORANCE
A MORE
DESPOTIC LITTLE MAN THAN M
PAUL NEVER FILLED A PROFESSOR'S CHAIR
I
NOTICED BY THE WAY THAT HE LOOKED AT THE PICTURE HIMSELF QUITE AT HIS
EASE AND FOR A VERY LONG WHILE HE DID NOT HOWEVER NEGLECT TO GLANCE
FROM TIME TO TIME MY WAY IN ORDER I SUPPOSE TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS
OBEYING ORDERS AND NOT BREAKING BOUNDS
BY AND BY HE AGAIN ACCOSTED
ME
HAD I NOT BEEN ILL HE WISHED TO KNOW HE UNDERSTOOD I HAD
YES BUT I WAS NOW QUITE WELL
WHERE HAD I SPENT THE VACATION
CHIEFLY IN THE RUE FOSSETTE PARTLY WITH MADAME BRETTON
HE HAD HEARD THAT I WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE RUE FOSSETTE WAS THAT SO
NOT QUITE ALONE MARIE BROC THE CRTIN WAS WITH ME
HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS VARIED AND CONTRADICTORY EXPRESSIONS PLAYED
RAPIDLY OVER HIS COUNTENANCE
MARIE BROC WAS WELL KNOWN TO M
PAUL HE
NEVER GAVE A LESSON IN THE THIRD DIVISION CONTAINING THE LEAST
ADVANCED PUPILS THAT SHE DID NOT OCCASION IN HIM A SHARP CONFLICT
BETWEEN ANTAGONISTIC IMPRESSIONS
HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE HER
REPULSIVE MANNERS HER OFTEN UNMANAGEABLE DISPOSITION IRRITATED HIS
TEMPER AND INSPIRED HIM WITH STRONG ANTIPATHY A FEELING HE WAS TOO
APT TO CONCEIVE WHEN HIS TASTE WAS OFFENDED OR HIS WILL THWARTED
ON
THE OTHER HAND HER MISFORTUNES CONSTITUTED A STRONG CLAIM ON HIS
FORBEARANCE AND COMPASSION SUCH A CLAIM AS IT WAS NOT IN HIS NATURE TO
DENY HENCE RESULTED ALMOST DAILY DRAWN BATTLES BETWEEN IMPATIENCE AND
DISGUST ON THE ONE HAND PITY AND A SENSE OF JUSTICE ON THE OTHER IN
WHICH TO HIS CREDIT BE IT SAID IT WAS VERY SELDOM THAT THE FORMER
FEELINGS PREVAILED WHEN THEY DID HOWEVER M
PAUL SHOWED A PHASE OF
CHARACTER WHICH HAD ITS TERRORS
HIS PASSIONS WERE STRONG HIS
AVERSIONS AND ATTACHMENTS ALIKE VIVID THE FORCE HE EXERTED IN HOLDING
BOTH IN CHECK BY NO MEANS MITIGATED AN OBSERVER'S SENSE OF THEIR
VEHEMENCE
WITH SUCH TENDENCIES IT MAY WELL BE SUPPOSED HE OFTEN
EXCITED IN ORDINARY MINDS FEAR AND DISLIKE YET IT WAS AN ERROR TO FEAR
HIM NOTHING DROVE HIM SO NEARLY FRANTIC AS THE TREMOR OF AN
APPREHENSIVE AND DISTRUSTFUL SPIRIT NOTHING SOOTHED HIM LIKE
CONFIDENCE TEMPERED WITH GENTLENESS
TO EVINCE THESE SENTIMENTS
HOWEVER REQUIRED A THOROUGH COMPREHENSION OF HIS NATURE AND HIS
NATURE WAS OF AN ORDER RARELY COMPREHENDED
HOW DID YOU GET ON WITH MARIE BROC HE ASKED AFTER SOME MINUTES'
SILENCE
MONSIEUR I DID MY BEST BUT IT WAS TERRIBLE TO BE ALONE WITH HER
YOU HAVE THEN A WEAK HEART YOU LACK COURAGE AND PERHAPS CHARITY
YOURS ARE NOT THE QUALITIES WHICH MIGHT CONSTITUTE A SISTER OF MERCY
HE WAS A RELIGIOUS LITTLE MAN IN HIS WAY THE SELF DENYING AND
SELF SACRIFICING PART OF THE CATHOLIC RELIGION COMMANDED THE HOMAGE OF
HIS SOUL
I DON'T KNOW INDEED I TOOK AS GOOD CARE OF HER AS I COULD BUT WHEN
HER AUNT CAME TO FETCH HER AWAY IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF
AH YOU ARE AN EGOTIST
THERE ARE WOMEN WHO HAVE NURSED HOSPITALS FULL
OF SIMILAR UNFORTUNATES
YOU COULD NOT DO THAT
COULD MONSIEUR DO IT HIMSELF
WOMEN WHO ARE WORTHY THE NAME OUGHT INFINITELY TO SURPASS OUR COARSE
FALLIBLE SELF INDULGENT SEX IN THE POWER TO PERFORM SUCH DUTIES
I WASHED HER I KEPT HER CLEAN I FED HER I TRIED TO AMUSE HER BUT
SHE MADE MOUTHS AT ME INSTEAD OF SPEAKING
YOU THINK YOU DID GREAT THINGS
NO BUT AS GREAT AS I COULD DO
THEN LIMITED ARE YOUR POWERS FOR IN TENDING ONE IDIOT YOU FELL SICK
NOT WITH THAT MONSIEUR I HAD A NERVOUS FEVER MY MIND WAS ILL
VRAIMENT VOUS VALEZ PEU DE CHOSE
YOU ARE NOT CAST IN AN HEROIC
MOULD YOUR COURAGE WILL NOT AVAIL TO SUSTAIN YOU IN SOLITUDE IT
MERELY GIVES YOU THE TEMERITY TO GAZE WITH SANG FROID AT PICTURES OF
CLEOPATRA
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO SHOW ANGER AT THE TEASING HOSTILE TONE OF
THE LITTLE MAN
I HAD NEVER BEEN ANGRY WITH HIM YET HOWEVER AND HAD
NO PRESENT DISPOSITION TO BEGIN
CLEOPATRA I REPEATED QUIETLY
MONSIEUR TOO HAS BEEN LOOKING AT
CLEOPATRA WHAT DOES HE THINK OF HER
CELA NE VAUT RIEN HE RESPONDED
UNE FEMME SUPERBE UNE TAILLE
D'IMPRATRICE DES FORMES DE JUNON MAIS UNE PERSONNE DONT JE NE
VOUDRAIS NI POUR FEMME NI POUR FILLE NI POUR SOEUR
AUSSI VOUS NE
JETEREZ PLUS UN SEUL COUP D'OEIL DE SA CT
BUT I HAVE LOOKED AT HER A GREAT MANY TIMES WHILE MONSIEUR HAS BEEN
TALKING I CAN SEE HER QUITE WELL FROM THIS CORNER
TURN TO THE WALL AND STUDY YOUR FOUR PICTURES OF A WOMAN'S LIFE
EXCUSE ME M
PAUL THEY ARE TOO HIDEOUS BUT IF YOU ADMIRE THEM
ALLOW ME TO VACATE MY SEAT AND LEAVE YOU TO THEIR CONTEMPLATION
MADEMOISELLE HE SAID GRIMACING A HALF SMILE OR WHAT HE INTENDED
FOR A SMILE THOUGH IT WAS BUT A GRIM AND HURRIED MANIFESTATION
YOU
NURSLINGS OF PROTESTANTISM ASTONISH ME
YOU UNGUARDED ENGLISHWOMEN WALK
CALMLY AMIDST RED HOT PLOUGHSHARES AND ESCAPE BURNING
I BELIEVE IF
SOME OF YOU WERE THROWN INTO NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S HOTTEST FURNACE YOU WOULD
ISSUE FORTH UNTRAVERSED BY THE SMELL OF FIRE
WILL MONSIEUR HAVE THE GOODNESS TO MOVE AN INCH TO ONE SIDE
HOW AT WHAT ARE YOU GAZING NOW YOU ARE NOT RECOGNISING AN
ACQUAINTANCE AMONGST THAT GROUP OF JEUNES GENS
I THINK SO YES I SEE THERE A PERSON I KNOW
IN FACT I HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A HEAD TOO PRETTY TO BELONG TO ANY
OTHER THAN THE REDOUBTED COLONEL DE HAMAL
WHAT A VERY FINISHED HIGHLY
POLISHED LITTLE PATE IT WAS WHAT A FIGURE SO TRIM AND NATTY WHAT
WOMANISH FEET AND HANDS HOW DAINTILY HE HELD A GLASS TO ONE OF HIS
OPTICS WITH WHAT ADMIRATION HE GAZED UPON THE CLEOPATRA AND THEN HOW
ENGAGINGLY HE TITTERED AND WHISPERED A FRIEND AT HIS ELBOW OH THE MAN
OF SENSE OH THE REFINED GENTLEMAN OF SUPERIOR TASTE AND TACT I
OBSERVED HIM FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS
EXCEEDINGLY TAKEN WITH THIS DUSK AND PORTLY VENUS OF THE NILE
SO MUCH
WAS I INTERESTED IN HIS BEARING SO ABSORBED IN DIVINING HIS CHARACTER
BY HIS LOOKS AND MOVEMENTS I TEMPORARILY FORGOT M
PAUL IN THE
INTERIM A GROUP CAME BETWEEN THAT GENTLEMAN AND ME OR POSSIBLY HIS
SCRUPLES MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED ANOTHER AND WORSE SHOCK FROM MY PRESENT
ABSTRACTION CAUSING HIM TO WITHDRAW VOLUNTARILY AT ANY RATE WHEN I
AGAIN LOOKED ROUND HE WAS GONE
MY EYE PURSUANT OF THE SEARCH MET NOT HIM BUT ANOTHER AND DISSIMILAR
FIGURE WELL SEEN AMIDST THE CROWD FOR THE HEIGHT AS WELL AS THE PORT
LENT EACH ITS DISTINCTION
THIS WAY CAME DR
JOHN IN VISAGE IN SHAPE
IN HUE AS UNLIKE THE DARK ACERB AND CAUSTIC LITTLE PROFESSOR AS THE
FRUIT OF THE HESPERIDES MIGHT BE UNLIKE THE SLOE IN THE WILD THICKET
AS THE HIGH COURAGED BUT TRACTABLE ARABIAN IS UNLIKE THE RUDE AND
STUBBORN SHELTIE HE WAS LOOKING FOR ME BUT HAD NOT YET EXPLORED THE
CORNER WHERE THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD JUST PUT ME
I REMAINED QUIET YET
ANOTHER MINUTE I WOULD WATCH
HE APPROACHED DE HAMAL HE PAUSED NEAR HIM I THOUGHT HE HAD A PLEASURE
IN LOOKING OVER HIS HEAD DR
BRETTON TOO GAZED ON THE CLEOPATRA
I
DOUBT IF IT WERE TO HIS TASTE HE DID NOT SIMPER LIKE THE LITTLE COUNT
HIS MOUTH LOOKED FASTIDIOUS HIS EYE COOL WITHOUT DEMONSTRATION HE
STEPPED ASIDE LEAVING ROOM FOR OTHERS TO APPROACH
I SAW NOW THAT HE
WAS WAITING AND RISING I JOINED HIM
WE TOOK ONE TURN ROUND THE GALLERY WITH GRAHAM IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO
TAKE SUCH A TURN
I ALWAYS LIKED DEARLY TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
ABOUT EITHER PICTURES OR BOOKS BECAUSE WITHOUT PRETENDING TO BE A
CONNOISSEUR HE ALWAYS SPOKE HIS THOUGHT AND THAT WAS SURE TO BE
FRESH VERY OFTEN IT WAS ALSO JUST AND PITHY
IT WAS PLEASANT ALSO TO
TELL HIM SOME THINGS HE DID NOT KNOW HE LISTENED SO KINDLY SO
TEACHABLY UNFORMALIZED BY SCRUPLES LEST SO TO BEND HIS BRIGHT HANDSOME
HEAD TO GATHER A WOMAN'S RATHER OBSCURE AND STAMMERING EXPLANATION
SHOULD IMPERIL THE DIGNITY OF HIS MANHOOD
AND WHEN HE COMMUNICATED
INFORMATION IN RETURN IT WAS WITH A LUCID INTELLIGENCE THAT LEFT ALL
HIS WORDS CLEAR GRAVEN ON THE MEMORY NO EXPLANATION OF HIS GIVING NO
FACT OF HIS NARRATING DID I EVER FORGET
AS WE LEFT THE GALLERY I ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE CLEOPATRA
AFTER MAKING HIM LAUGH BY TELLING HIM HOW PROFESSOR EMANUEL HAD SENT
ME TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AND TAKING HIM TO SEE THE SWEET SERIES OF
PICTURES RECOMMENDED TO MY ATTENTION
POOH SAID HE
MY MOTHER IS A BETTER LOOKING WOMAN
I HEARD SOME
FRENCH FOPS YONDER DESIGNATING HER AS 'LE TYPE DU VOLUPTUEUX IF SO
I CAN ONLY SAY 'LE VOLUPTUEUX' IS LITTLE TO MY LIKING
COMPARE THAT
MULATTO WITH GINEVRA
CHAPTER XX
THE CONCERT
ONE MORNING MRS
BRETTON COMING PROMPTLY INTO MY ROOM DESIRED ME TO
OPEN MY DRAWERS AND SHOW HER MY DRESSES WHICH I DID WITHOUT A WORD
THAT WILL DO SAID SHE WHEN SHE HAD TURNED THEM OVER
YOU MUST HAVE
A NEW ONE
SHE WENT OUT
SHE RETURNED PRESENTLY WITH A DRESSMAKER
SHE HAD ME
MEASURED
I MEAN SAID SHE TO FOLLOW MY OWN TASTE AND TO HAVE MY
OWN WAY IN THIS LITTLE MATTER
TWO DAYS AFTER CAME HOME A PINK DRESS
THAT IS NOT FOR ME I SAID HURRIEDLY FEELING THAT I WOULD ALMOST AS
SOON CLOTHE MYSELF IN THE COSTUME OF A CHINESE LADY OF RANK
WE SHALL SEE WHETHER IT IS FOR YOU OR NOT REJOINED MY GODMOTHER
ADDING WITH HER RESISTLESS DECISION MARK MY WORDS
YOU WILL WEAR IT
THIS VERY EVENING
I THOUGHT I SHOULD NOT I THOUGHT NO HUMAN FORCE SHOULD AVAIL TO PUT ME
INTO IT
A PINK DRESS I KNEW IT NOT
IT KNEW NOT ME
I HAD NOT PROVED
IT
MY GODMOTHER WENT ON TO DECREE THAT I WAS TO GO WITH HER AND GRAHAM TO
A CONCERT THAT SAME NIGHT WHICH CONCERT SHE EXPLAINED WAS A GRAND
AFFAIR TO BE HELD IN THE LARGE SALLE OR HALL OF THE PRINCIPAL MUSICAL
SOCIETY
THE MOST ADVANCED OF THE PUPILS OF THE CONSERVATOIRE WERE TO
PERFORM IT WAS TO BE FOLLOWED BY A LOTTERY AU BNFICE DES PAUVRES
AND TO CROWN ALL THE KING QUEEN AND PRINCE OF LABASSECOUR WERE TO BE
PRESENT
GRAHAM IN SENDING TICKETS HAD ENJOINED ATTENTION TO COSTUME
AS A COMPLIMENT DUE TO ROYALTY HE ALSO RECOMMENDED PUNCTUAL READINESS
BY SEVEN O'CLOCK
ABOUT SIX I WAS USHERED UPSTAIRS
WITHOUT ANY FORCE AT ALL I FOUND
MYSELF LED AND INFLUENCED BY ANOTHER'S WILL UNCONSULTED UNPERSUADED
QUIETLY OVERRULED
IN SHORT THE PINK DRESS WENT ON SOFTENED BY SOME
DRAPERY OF BLACK LACE
I WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE EN GRANDE TENUE AND
REQUESTED TO LOOK IN THE GLASS
I DID SO WITH SOME FEAR AND TREMBLING
WITH MORE FEAR AND TREMBLING I TURNED AWAY
SEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK DR
BRETTON WAS COME MY GODMOTHER AND I WENT DOWN
SHE WAS CLAD IN BROWN
VELVET AS I WALKED IN HER SHADOW HOW I ENVIED HER THOSE FOLDS OF
GRAVE DARK MAJESTY GRAHAM STOOD IN THE DRAWING ROOM DOORWAY
I DO HOPE HE WILL NOT THINK I HAVE BEEN DECKING MYSELF OUT TO DRAW
ATTENTION WAS MY UNEASY ASPIRATION
HERE LUCY ARE SOME FLOWERS SAID HE GIVING ME A BOUQUET
HE TOOK
NO FURTHER NOTICE OF MY DRESS THAN WAS CONVEYED IN A KIND SMILE AND
SATISFIED NOD WHICH CALMED AT ONCE MY SENSE OF SHAME AND FEAR OF
RIDICULE
FOR THE REST THE DRESS WAS MADE WITH EXTREME SIMPLICITY
GUILTLESS OF FLOUNCE OR FURBELOW IT WAS BUT THE LIGHT FABRIC AND
BRIGHT TINT WHICH SCARED ME AND SINCE GRAHAM FOUND IN IT NOTHING
ABSURD MY OWN EYE CONSENTED SOON TO BECOME RECONCILED
I SUPPOSE PEOPLE WHO GO EVERY NIGHT TO PLACES OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT CAN
HARDLY ENTER INTO THE FRESH GALA FEELING WITH WHICH AN OPERA OR A
CONCERT IS ENJOYED BY THOSE FOR WHOM IT IS A RARITY I AM NOT SURE THAT
I EXPECTED GREAT PLEASURE FROM THE CONCERT HAVING BUT A VERY VAGUE
NOTION OF ITS NATURE BUT I LIKED THE DRIVE THERE WELL
THE SNUG
COMFORT OF THE CLOSE CARRIAGE ON A COLD THOUGH FINE NIGHT THE PLEASURE
OF SETTING OUT WITH COMPANIONS SO CHEERFUL AND FRIENDLY THE SIGHT OF
THE STARS GLINTING FITFULLY THROUGH THE TREES AS WE ROLLED ALONG THE
AVENUE THEN THE FREER BURST OF THE NIGHT SKY WHEN WE ISSUED FORTH TO
THE OPEN CHAUSSE THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE CITY GATES THE LIGHTS THERE
BURNING THE GUARDS THERE POSTED THE PRETENCE OF INSPECTION TO WHICH
WE THERE SUBMITTED AND WHICH AMUSED US SO MUCH ALL THESE SMALL
MATTERS HAD FOR ME IN THEIR NOVELTY A PECULIARLY EXHILARATING CHARM
HOW MUCH OF IT LAY IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF FRIENDSHIP DIFFUSED ABOUT ME I
KNOW NOT DR
JOHN AND HIS MOTHER WERE BOTH IN THEIR FINEST MOOD
CONTENDING ANIMATEDLY WITH EACH OTHER THE WHOLE WAY AND AS FRANKLY
KIND TO ME AS IF I HAD BEEN OF THEIR KIN
OUR WAY LAY THROUGH SOME OF THE BEST STREETS OF VILLETTE STREETS
BRIGHTLY LIT AND FAR MORE LIVELY NOW THAN AT HIGH NOON
HOW BRILLIANT
SEEMED THE SHOPS HOW GLAD GAY AND ABUNDANT FLOWED THE TIDE OF LIFE
ALONG THE BROAD PAVEMENT WHILE I LOOKED THE THOUGHT OF THE RUE
FOSSETTE CAME ACROSS ME OF THE WALLED IN GARDEN AND SCHOOL HOUSE AND
OF THE DARK VAST CLASSES WHERE AS AT THIS VERY HOUR IT WAS MY
WONT TO WANDER ALL SOLITARY GAZING AT THE STARS THROUGH THE HIGH
BLINDLESS WINDOWS AND LISTENING TO THE DISTANT VOICE OF THE READER IN
THE REFECTORY MONOTONOUSLY EXERCISED UPON THE LECTURE PIEUSE THUS
MUST I SOON AGAIN LISTEN AND WANDER AND THIS SHADOW OF THE FUTURE
STOLE WITH TIMELY SOBRIETY ACROSS THE RADIANT PRESENT
BY THIS TIME WE HAD GOT INTO A CURRENT OF CARRIAGES ALL TENDING IN ONE
DIRECTION AND SOON THE FRONT OF A GREAT ILLUMINATED BUILDING BLAZED
BEFORE US
OF WHAT I SHOULD SEE WITHIN THIS BUILDING I HAD AS BEFORE
INTIMATED BUT AN IMPERFECT IDEA FOR NO PLACE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT
HAD IT EVER BEEN MY LOT TO ENTER YET
WE ALIGHTED UNDER A PORTICO WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT BUSTLE AND A GREAT
CROWD BUT I DO NOT DISTINCTLY REMEMBER FURTHER DETAILS UNTIL I FOUND
MYSELF MOUNTING A MAJESTIC STAIRCASE WIDE AND EASY OF ASCENT DEEPLY
AND SOFTLY CARPETED WITH CRIMSON LEADING UP TO GREAT DOORS CLOSED
SOLEMNLY AND WHOSE PANELS WERE ALSO CRIMSON CLOTHED
I HARDLY NOTICED BY WHAT MAGIC THESE DOORS WERE MADE TO ROLL BACK DR
JOHN MANAGED THESE POINTS ROLL BACK THEY DID HOWEVER AND WITHIN WAS
DISCLOSED A HALL GRAND WIDE AND HIGH WHOSE SWEEPING CIRCULAR WALLS
AND DOMED HOLLOW CEILING SEEMED TO ME ALL DEAD GOLD THUS WITH NICE
ART WAS IT STAINED RELIEVED BY CORNICING FLUTING AND GARLANDRY
EITHER BRIGHT LIKE GOLD BURNISHED OR SNOW WHITE LIKE ALABASTER OR
WHITE AND GOLD MINGLED IN WREATHS OF GILDED LEAVES AND SPOTLESS LILIES
WHEREVER DRAPERY HUNG WHEREVER CARPETS WERE SPREAD OR CUSHIONS
PLACED THE SOLE COLOUR EMPLOYED WAS DEEP CRIMSON
PENDENT FROM THE
DOME FLAMED A MASS THAT DAZZLED ME A MASS I THOUGHT OF
ROCK CRYSTAL SPARKLING WITH FACETS STREAMING WITH DROPS ABLAZE WITH
STARS AND GORGEOUSLY TINGED WITH DEWS OF GEMS DISSOLVED OR FRAGMENTS
OF RAINBOWS SHIVERED
IT WAS ONLY THE CHANDELIER READER BUT FOR ME IT
SEEMED THE WORK OF EASTERN GENII I ALMOST LOOKED TO SEE IF A HUGE
DARK CLOUDY HAND THAT OF THE SLAVE OF THE LAMP WERE NOT HOVERING IN
THE LUSTROUS AND PERFUMED ATMOSPHERE OF THE CUPOLA GUARDING ITS
WONDROUS TREASURE
WE MOVED ON I WAS NOT AT ALL CONSCIOUS WHITHER BUT AT SOME TURN WE
SUDDENLY ENCOUNTERED ANOTHER PARTY APPROACHING FROM THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
I JUST NOW SEE THAT GROUP AS IT FLASHED UPON ME FOR ONE
MOMENT
A HANDSOME MIDDLE AGED LADY IN DARK VELVET A GENTLEMAN WHO
MIGHT BE HER SON THE BEST FACE THE FINEST FIGURE I THOUGHT I HAD
EVER SEEN A THIRD PERSON IN A PINK DRESS AND BLACK LACE MANTLE
I NOTED THEM ALL THE THIRD PERSON AS WELL AS THE OTHER TWO AND FOR
THE FRACTION OF A MOMENT BELIEVED THEM ALL STRANGERS THUS RECEIVING AN
IMPARTIAL IMPRESSION OF THEIR APPEARANCE
BUT THE IMPRESSION WAS HARDLY
FELT AND NOT FIXED BEFORE THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I FACED A GREAT
MIRROR FILLING A COMPARTMENT BETWEEN TWO PILLARS DISPELLED IT THE
PARTY WAS OUR OWN PARTY
THUS FOR THE FIRST AND PERHAPS ONLY TIME IN
MY LIFE I ENJOYED THE GIFTIE OF SEEING MYSELF AS OTHERS SEE ME
NO
NEED TO DWELL ON THE RESULT
IT BROUGHT A JAR OF DISCORD A PANG OF
REGRET IT WAS NOT FLATTERING YET AFTER ALL I OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE
AT LAST WE WERE SEATED IN PLACES COMMANDING A GOOD GENERAL VIEW OF
THAT VAST AND DAZZLING BUT WARM AND CHEERFUL HALL
ALREADY IT WAS
FILLED AND FILLED WITH A SPLENDID ASSEMBLAGE
I DO NOT KNOW THAT THE
WOMEN WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT THEIR DRESSES WERE SO PERFECT AND
FOREIGNERS EVEN SUCH AS ARE UNGRACEFUL IN DOMESTIC PRIVACY SEEM TO
POSSES THE ART OF APPEARING GRACEFUL IN PUBLIC HOWEVER BLUNT AND
BOISTEROUS THOSE EVERY DAY AND HOME MOVEMENTS CONNECTED WITH PEIGNOIR
AND PAPILLOTES THERE IS A SLIDE A BEND A CARRIAGE OF THE HEAD AND
ARMS A MIEN OF THE MOUTH AND EYES KEPT NICELY IN RESERVE FOR GALA
USE ALWAYS BROUGHT OUT WITH THE GRANDE TOILETTE AND DULY PUT ON WITH
THE PARURE
SOME FINE FORMS THERE WERE HERE AND THERE MODELS OF A PECULIAR STYLE
OF BEAUTY A STYLE I THINK NEVER SEEN IN ENGLAND A SOLID FIRM SET
SCULPTURAL STYLE
THESE SHAPES HAVE NO ANGLES A CARYATID IN MARBLE IS
ALMOST AS FLEXIBLE A PHIDIAN GODDESS IS NOT MORE PERFECT IN A CERTAIN
STILL AND STATELY SORT
THEY HAVE SUCH FEATURES AS THE DUTCH PAINTERS
GIVE TO THEIR MADONNAS LOW COUNTRY CLASSIC FEATURES REGULAR BUT
ROUND STRAIGHT BUT STOLID AND FOR THEIR DEPTH OF EXPRESSIONLESS CALM
OF PASSIONLESS PEACE A POLAR SNOW FIELD COULD ALONE OFFER A TYPE
WOMEN OF THIS ORDER NEED NO ORNAMENT AND THEY SELDOM WEAR ANY THE
SMOOTH HAIR CLOSELY BRAIDED SUPPLIES A SUFFICIENT CONTRAST TO THE
SMOOTHER CHEEK AND BROW THE DRESS CANNOT BE TOO SIMPLE THE ROUNDED
ARM AND PERFECT NECK REQUIRE NEITHER BRACELET NOR CHAIN
WITH ONE OF THESE BEAUTIES I ONCE HAD THE HONOUR AND RAPTURE TO BE
PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED THE INERT FORCE OF THE DEEP SETTLED LOVE SHE
BORE HERSELF WAS WONDERFUL IT COULD ONLY BE SURPASSED BY HER PROUD
IMPOTENCY TO CARE FOR ANY OTHER LIVING THING
OF BLOOD HER COOL VEINS
CONDUCTED NO FLOW PLACID LYMPH FILLED AND ALMOST OBSTRUCTED HER
ARTERIES
SUCH A JUNO AS I HAVE DESCRIBED SAT FULL IN OUR VIEW A SORT OF MARK
FOR ALL EYES AND QUITE CONSCIOUS THAT SO SHE WAS BUT PROOF TO THE
MAGNETIC INFLUENCE OF GAZE OR GLANCE COLD ROUNDED BLONDE AND
BEAUTEOUS AS THE WHITE COLUMN CAPITALLED WITH GILDING WHICH ROSE AT
HER SIDE
OBSERVING THAT DR
JOHN'S ATTENTION WAS MUCH DRAWN TOWARDS HER I
ENTREATED HIM IN A LOW VOICE FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN TO SHIELD WELL HIS
HEART
YOU NEED NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH THAT LADY I SAID BECAUSE I
TELL YOU BEFOREHAND YOU MIGHT DIE AT HER FEET AND SHE WOULD NOT LOVE
YOU AGAIN
VERY WELL SAID HE AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE SPECTACLE OF HER
GRAND INSENSIBILITY MIGHT NOT WITH ME BE THE STRONGEST STIMULUS TO
HOMAGE THE STING OF DESPERATION IS I THINK A WONDERFUL IRRITANT TO
MY EMOTIONS BUT SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
THESE THINGS I'LL ADDRESS MYSELF TO MY MOTHER
MAMMA I'M IN A
DANGEROUS WAY
AS IF THAT INTERESTED ME SAID MRS
BRETTON
ALAS THE CRUELTY OF MY LOT RESPONDED HER SON
NEVER MAN HAD A MORE
UNSENTIMENTAL MOTHER THAN MINE SHE NEVER SEEMS TO THINK THAT SUCH A
CALAMITY CAN BEFALL HER AS A DAUGHTER IN LAW
IF I DON'T IT IS NOT FOR WANT OF HAVING THAT SAME CALAMITY HELD OVER
MY HEAD YOU HAVE THREATENED ME WITH IT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS
'MAMMA
I AM GOING TO BE MARRIED SOON WAS THE CRY BEFORE YOU WERE WELL OUT OF
JACKETS
BUT MOTHER ONE OF THESE DAYS IT WILL BE REALIZED
ALL OF A SUDDEN
WHEN YOU THINK YOU ARE MOST SECURE I SHALL GO FORTH LIKE JACOB OR
ESAU OR ANY OTHER PATRIARCH AND TAKE ME A WIFE PERHAPS OF THESE
WHICH ARE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF THE LAND
AT YOUR PERIL JOHN GRAHAM THAT IS ALL
THIS MOTHER OF MINE MEANS ME TO BE AN OLD BACHELOR
WHAT A JEALOUS OLD
LADY IT IS BUT NOW JUST LOOK AT THAT SPLENDID CREATURE IN THE PALE
BLUE SATIN DRESS AND HAIR OF PALER BROWN WITH 'REFLETS SATINS' AS
THOSE OF HER ROBE
WOULD YOU NOT FEEL PROUD MAMMA IF I WERE TO BRING
THAT GODDESS HOME SOME DAY AND INTRODUCE HER TO YOU AS MRS
BRETTON
JUNIOR
YOU WILL BRING NO GODDESS TO LA TERRASSE THAT LITTLE CHTEAU WILL NOT
CONTAIN TWO MISTRESSES ESPECIALLY IF THE SECOND BE OF THE HEIGHT
BULK AND CIRCUMFERENCE OF THAT MIGHTY DOLL IN WOOD AND WAX AND KID
AND SATIN
MAMMA SHE WOULD FILL YOUR BLUE CHAIR SO ADMIRABLY
FILL MY CHAIR I DEFY THE FOREIGN USURPER A RUEFUL CHAIR SHOULD IT BE
FOR HER BUT HUSH JOHN GRAHAM HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND USE YOUR EYES
DURING THE ABOVE SKIRMISH THE HALL WHICH I HAD THOUGHT SEEMED FULL
AT THE ENTRANCE CONTINUED TO ADMIT PARTY AFTER PARTY UNTIL THE
SEMICIRCLE BEFORE THE STAGE PRESENTED ONE DENSE MASS OF HEADS SLOPING
FROM FLOOR TO CEILING
THE STAGE TOO OR RATHER THE WIDE TEMPORARY
PLATFORM LARGER THAN ANY STAGE DESERT HALF AN HOUR SINCE WAS NOW
OVERFLOWING WITH LIFE ROUND TWO GRAND PIANOS PLACED ABOUT THE CENTRE
A WHITE FLOCK OF YOUNG GIRLS THE PUPILS OF THE CONSERVATOIRE HAD
NOISELESSLY POURED
I HAD NOTICED THEIR GATHERING WHILE GRAHAM AND HIS
MOTHER WERE ENGAGED IN DISCUSSING THE BELLE IN BLUE SATIN AND HAD
WATCHED WITH INTEREST THE PROCESS OF ARRAYING AND MARSHALLING THEM
TWO
GENTLEMEN IN EACH OF WHOM I RECOGNISED AN ACQUAINTANCE OFFICERED THIS
VIRGIN TROOP
ONE AN ARTISTIC LOOKING MAN BEARDED AND WITH LONG
HAIR WAS A NOTED PIANISTE AND ALSO THE FIRST MUSIC TEACHER IN
VILLETTE HE ATTENDED TWICE A WEEK AT MADAME BECK'S PENSIONNAT TO GIVE
LESSONS TO THE FEW PUPILS WHOSE PARENTS WERE RICH ENOUGH TO ALLOW THEIR
DAUGHTERS THE PRIVILEGE OF HIS INSTRUCTIONS HIS NAME WAS M
JOSEF
EMANUEL AND HE WAS HALF BROTHER TO M
PAUL WHICH POTENT PERSONAGE WAS
NOW VISIBLE IN THE PERSON OF THE SECOND GENTLEMAN
M
PAUL AMUSED ME I SMILED TO MYSELF AS I WATCHED HIM HE SEEMED SO
THOROUGHLY IN HIS ELEMENT STANDING CONSPICUOUS IN PRESENCE OF A WIDE
AND GRAND ASSEMBLAGE ARRANGING RESTRAINING OVER AWEING ABOUT ONE
HUNDRED YOUNG LADIES
HE WAS TOO SO PERFECTLY IN EARNEST SO
ENERGETIC SO INTENT AND ABOVE ALL SO ABSOLUTE AND YET WHAT
BUSINESS HAD HE THERE WHAT HAD HE TO DO WITH MUSIC OR THE
CONSERVATOIREHE WHO COULD HARDLY DISTINGUISH ONE NOTE FROM ANOTHER I
KNEW THAT IT WAS HIS LOVE OF DISPLAY AND AUTHORITY WHICH HAD BROUGHT
HIM THERE A LOVE NOT OFFENSIVE ONLY BECAUSE SO NAIVE
IT PRESENTLY
BECAME OBVIOUS THAT HIS BROTHER M
JOSEF WAS AS MUCH UNDER HIS
CONTROL AS WERE THE GIRLS THEMSELVES
NEVER WAS SUCH A LITTLE HAWK OF A
MAN AS THAT M
PAUL ERE LONG SOME NOTED SINGERS AND MUSICIANS DAWNED
UPON THE PLATFORM AS THESE STARS ROSE THE COMET LIKE PROFESSOR SET
INSUFFERABLE TO HIM WERE ALL NOTORIETIES AND CELEBRITIES WHERE HE
COULD NOT OUTSHINE HE FLED
AND NOW ALL WAS PREPARED BUT ONE COMPARTMENT OF THE HALL WAITED TO BE
FILLED A COMPARTMENT COVERED WITH CRIMSON LIKE THE GRAND STAIRCASE
AND DOORS FURNISHED WITH STUFFED AND CUSHIONED BENCHES RANGED ON EACH
SIDE OF TWO REGAL CHAIRS PLACED SOLEMNLY UNDER A CANOPY
A SIGNAL WAS GIVEN THE DOORS ROLLED BACK THE ASSEMBLY STOOD UP THE
ORCHESTRA BURST OUT AND TO THE WELCOME OF A CHORAL BURST ENTER THE
KING THE QUEEN THE COURT OF LABASSECOUR
TILL THEN I HAD NEVER SET EYES ON LIVING KING OR QUEEN IT MAY
CONSEQUENTLY BE CONJECTURED HOW I STRAINED MY POWERS OF VISION TO TAKE
IN THESE SPECIMENS OF EUROPEAN ROYALTY
BY WHOMSOEVER MAJESTY IS BEHELD
FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE WILL ALWAYS BE EXPERIENCED A VAGUE SURPRISE
BORDERING ON DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE SAME DOES NOT APPEAR SEATED EN
PERMANENCE ON A THRONE BONNETED WITH A CROWN AND FURNISHED AS TO
THE HAND WITH A SCEPTRE
LOOKING OUT FOR A KING AND QUEEN AND SEEING
ONLY A MIDDLE AGED SOLDIER AND A RATHER YOUNG LADY I FELT HALF
CHEATED HALF PLEASED
WELL DO I RECALL THAT KING A MAN OF FIFTY A LITTLE BOWED A LITTLE
GREY THERE WAS NO FACE IN ALL THAT ASSEMBLY WHICH RESEMBLED HIS
I HAD
NEVER READ NEVER BEEN TOLD ANYTHING OF HIS NATURE OR HIS HABITS AND
AT FIRST THE STRONG HIEROGLYPHICS GRAVEN AS WITH IRON STYLET ON HIS
BROW ROUND HIS EYES BESIDE HIS MOUTH PUZZLED AND BAFFLED INSTINCT
ERE LONG HOWEVER IF I DID NOT KNOW AT LEAST I FELT THE MEANING OF
THOSE CHARACTERS WRITTEN WITHOUT HAND
THERE SAT A SILENT SUFFERER A
NERVOUS MELANCHOLY MAN
THOSE EYES HAD LOOKED ON THE VISITS OF A
CERTAIN GHOST HAD LONG WAITED THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF THAT STRANGEST
SPECTRE HYPOCHONDRIA
PERHAPS HE SAW HER NOW ON THAT STAGE OVER
AGAINST HIM AMIDST ALL THAT BRILLIANT THRONG
HYPOCHONDRIA HAS THAT
WONT TO RISE IN THE MIDST OF THOUSANDS DARK AS DOOM PALE AS MALADY
AND WELL NIGH STRONG AS DEATH
HER COMRADE AND VICTIM THINKS TO BE
HAPPY ONE MOMENT NOT SO SAYS SHE I COME AND SHE FREEZES THE
BLOOD IN HIS HEART AND BECLOUDS THE LIGHT IN HIS EYE
SOME MIGHT SAY IT WAS THE FOREIGN CROWN PRESSING THE KING'S BROWS WHICH
BENT THEM TO THAT PECULIAR AND PAINFUL FOLD SOME MIGHT QUOTE THE
EFFECTS OF EARLY BEREAVEMENT
SOMETHING THERE MIGHT BE OF BOTH THESE
BUT THESE ARE EMBITTERED BY THAT DARKEST FOE OF
HUMANITY CONSTITUTIONAL MELANCHOLY
THE QUEEN HIS WIFE KNEW THIS IT
SEEMED TO ME THE REFLECTION OF HER HUSBAND'S GRIEF LAY A SUBDUING
SHADOW ON HER OWN BENIGNANT FACE
A MILD THOUGHTFUL GRACEFUL WOMAN
THAT PRINCESS SEEMED NOT BEAUTIFUL NOT AT ALL LIKE THE WOMEN OF SOLID
CHARMS AND MARBLE FEELINGS DESCRIBED A PAGE OR TWO SINCE
HERS WAS A
SOMEWHAT SLENDER SHAPE HER FEATURES THOUGH DISTINGUISHED ENOUGH WERE
TOO SUGGESTIVE OF REIGNING DYNASTIES AND ROYAL LINES TO GIVE
UNQUALIFIED PLEASURE
THE EXPRESSION CLOTHING THAT PROFILE WAS
AGREEABLE IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE BUT YOU COULD NOT AVOID CONNECTING
IT WITH REMEMBERED EFFIGIES WHERE SIMILAR LINES APPEARED UNDER PHASE
IGNOBLE FEEBLE OR SENSUAL OR CUNNING AS THE CASE MIGHT BE
THE
QUEEN'S EYE HOWEVER WAS HER OWN AND PITY GOODNESS SWEET SYMPATHY
BLESSED IT WITH DIVINEST LIGHT
SHE MOVED NO SOVEREIGN BUT A
LADY KIND LOVING ELEGANT
HER LITTLE SON THE PRINCE OF LABASSECOUR
AND YOUNG DUC DE DINDONNEAU ACCOMPANIED HER HE LEANED ON HIS MOTHER'S
KNEE AND EVER AND ANON IN THE COURSE OF THAT EVENING I SAW HER
OBSERVANT OF THE MONARCH AT HER SIDE CONSCIOUS OF HIS BECLOUDED
ABSTRACTION AND DESIROUS TO ROUSE HIM FROM IT BY DRAWING HIS ATTENTION
TO THEIR SON
SHE OFTEN BENT HER HEAD TO LISTEN TO THE BOY'S REMARKS
AND WOULD THEN SMILINGLY REPEAT THEM TO HIS SIRE
THE MOODY KING
STARTED LISTENED SMILED BUT INVARIABLY RELAPSED AS SOON AS HIS GOOD
ANGEL CEASED SPEAKING
FULL MOURNFUL AND SIGNIFICANT WAS THAT
SPECTACLE NOT THE LESS SO BECAUSE BOTH FOR THE ARISTOCRACY AND THE
HONEST BOURGEOISIE OF LABASSECOUR ITS PECULIARITY SEEMED TO BE WHOLLY
INVISIBLE I COULD NOT DISCOVER THAT ONE SOUL PRESENT WAS EITHER STRUCK
OR TOUCHED
WITH THE KING AND QUEEN HAD ENTERED THEIR COURT COMPRISING TWO OR
THREE FOREIGN AMBASSADORS AND WITH THEM CAME THE ELITE OF THE
FOREIGNERS THEN RESIDENT IN VILLETTE
THESE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE
CRIMSON BENCHES THE LADIES WERE SEATED MOST OF THE MEN REMAINED
STANDING THEIR SABLE RANK LINING THE BACKGROUND LOOKED LIKE A DARK
FOIL TO THE SPLENDOUR DISPLAYED IN FRONT
NOR WAS THIS SPLENDOUR
WITHOUT VARYING LIGHT AND SHADE AND GRADATION THE MIDDLE DISTANCE WAS
FILLED WITH MATRONS IN VELVETS AND SATINS IN PLUMES AND GEMS THE
BENCHES IN THE FOREGROUND TO THE QUEEN'S RIGHT HAND SEEMED DEVOTED
EXCLUSIVELY TO YOUNG GIRLS THE FLOWER PERHAPS I SHOULD RATHER SAY
THE BUD OF VILLETTE ARISTOCRACY
HERE WERE NO JEWELS NO HEAD DRESSES
NO VELVET PILE OR SILKEN SHEEN PURITY SIMPLICITY AND ARIAL GRACE
REIGNED IN THAT VIRGIN BAND
YOUNG HEADS SIMPLY BRAIDED AND FAIR FORMS
I WAS GOING TO WRITE SYLPH FORMS BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE
UNTRUE SEVERAL OF THESE JEUNES FILLES WHO HAD NOT NUMBERED MORE
THAN SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS BOASTED CONTOURS AS ROBUST AND SOLID
AS THOSE OF A STOUT ENGLISHWOMAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY FAIR FORMS ROBED
IN WHITE OR PALE ROSE OR PLACID BLUE SUGGESTED THOUGHTS OF HEAVEN
AND ANGELS
I KNEW A COUPLE AT LEAST OF THESE ROSE ET BLANCHE
SPECIMENS OF HUMANITY
HERE WAS A PAIR OF MADAME BECK'S LATE
PUPILS MESDEMOISELLES MATHILDE AND ANGLIQUE PUPILS WHO DURING THEIR
LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST CLASS BUT WHOSE
BRAINS NEVER GOT THEM BEYOND THE SECOND DIVISION
IN ENGLISH THEY HAD
BEEN UNDER MY OWN CHARGE AND HARD WORK IT WAS TO GET THEM TO TRANSLATE
RATIONALLY A PAGE OF THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD
ALSO DURING THREE MONTHS
I HAD ONE OF THEM FOR MY VIS VIS AT TABLE AND THE QUANTITY OF
HOUSEHOLD BREAD BUTTER AND STEWED FRUIT SHE WOULD HABITUALLY CONSUME
AT SECOND DJEUNER WAS A REAL WORLD'S WONDER TO BE EXCEEDED ONLY BY
THE FACT OF HER ACTUALLY POCKETING SLICES SHE COULD NOT EAT
HERE BE
TRUTHS WHOLESOME TRUTHS TOO
I KNEW ANOTHER OF THESE SERAPHS THE PRETTIEST OR AT ANY RATE THE
LEAST DEMURE AND HYPOCRITICAL LOOKING OF THE LOT SHE WAS SEATED BY THE
DAUGHTER OF AN ENGLISH PEER ALSO AN HONEST THOUGH HAUGHTY LOOKING
GIRL BOTH HAD ENTERED IN THE SUITE OF THE BRITISH EMBASSY
SHE I E
MY ACQUAINTANCE HAD A SLIGHT PLIANT FIGURE NOT AT ALL LIKE THE FORMS
OF THE FOREIGN DAMSELS HER HAIR TOO WAS NOT CLOSE BRAIDED LIKE A
SHELL OR A SKULL CAP OF SATIN IT LOOKED LIKE HAIR AND WAVED FROM
HER HEAD LONG CURLED AND FLOWING
SHE CHATTED AWAY VOLUBLY AND
SEEMED FULL OF A LIGHT HEADED SORT OF SATISFACTION WITH HERSELF AND HER
POSITION
I DID NOT LOOK AT DR
BRETTON BUT I KNEW THAT HE TOO SAW
GINEVRA FANSHAWE HE HAD BECOME SO QUIET HE ANSWERED SO BRIEFLY HIS
MOTHER'S REMARKS HE SO OFTEN SUPPRESSED A SIGH
WHY SHOULD HE SIGH HE
HAD CONFESSED A TASTE FOR THE PURSUIT OF LOVE UNDER DIFFICULTIES HERE
WAS FULL GRATIFICATION FOR THAT TASTE
HIS LADY LOVE BEAMED UPON HIM
FROM A SPHERE ABOVE HIS OWN HE COULD NOT COME NEAR HER HE WAS NOT
CERTAIN THAT HE COULD WIN FROM HER A LOOK
I WATCHED TO SEE IF SHE
WOULD SO FAR FAVOUR HIM
OUR SEAT WAS NOT FAR FROM THE CRIMSON BENCHES
WE MUST INEVITABLY BE SEEN THENCE BY EYES SO QUICK AND ROVING AS MISS
FANSHAWE'S AND VERY SOON THOSE OPTICS OF HERS WERE UPON US AT LEAST
UPON DR
AND MRS
BRETTON
I KEPT RATHER IN THE SHADE AND OUT OF SIGHT
NOT WISHING TO BE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISED SHE LOOKED QUITE STEADILY AT
DR
JOHN AND THEN SHE RAISED A GLASS TO EXAMINE HIS MOTHER A MINUTE
OR TWO AFTERWARDS SHE LAUGHINGLY WHISPERED HER NEIGHBOUR UPON THE
PERFORMANCE COMMENCING HER RAMBLING ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED TO THE
PLATFORM
ON THE CONCERT I NEED NOT DWELL THE READER WOULD NOT CARE TO HAVE MY
IMPRESSIONS THEREANENT AND INDEED IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH WHILE TO
RECORD THEM AS THEY WERE THE IMPRESSIONS OF AN IGNORANCE CRASSE
THE
YOUNG LADIES OF THE CONSERVATOIRE BEING VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED MADE
RATHER A TREMULOUS EXHIBITION ON THE TWO GRAND PIANOS
M
JOSEF EMANUEL
STOOD BY THEM WHILE THEY PLAYED BUT HE HAD NOT THE TACT OR INFLUENCE
OF HIS KINSMAN WHO UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE
COMPELLED PUPILS OF HIS TO DEMEAN THEMSELVES WITH HEROISM AND
SELF POSSESSION
M
PAUL WOULD HAVE PLACED THE HYSTERIC DBUTANTES
BETWEEN TWO FIRES TERROR OF THE AUDIENCE AND TERROR OF HIMSELF AND
WOULD HAVE INSPIRED THEM WITH THE COURAGE OF DESPERATION BY MAKING THE
LATTER TERROR INCOMPARABLY THE GREATER M
JOSEF COULD NOT DO THIS
FOLLOWING THE WHITE MUSLIN PIANISTES CAME A FINE FULL GROWN SULKY
LADY IN WHITE SATIN
SHE SANG
HER SINGING JUST AFFECTED ME LIKE THE
TRICKS OF A CONJUROR I WONDERED HOW SHE DID IT HOW SHE MADE HER VOICE
RUN UP AND DOWN AND CUT SUCH MARVELLOUS CAPERS BUT A SIMPLE SCOTCH
MELODY PLAYED BY A RUDE STREET MINSTREL HAS OFTEN MOVED ME MORE
DEEPLY
AFTERWARDS STEPPED FORTH A GENTLEMAN WHO BENDING HIS BODY A GOOD DEAL
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE KING AND QUEEN AND FREQUENTLY APPROACHING HIS
WHITE GLOVED HAND TO THE REGION OF HIS HEART VENTED A BITTER OUTCRY
AGAINST A CERTAIN FAUSSE ISABELLE I THOUGHT HE SEEMED ESPECIALLY TO
SOLICIT THE QUEEN'S SYMPATHY BUT UNLESS I AM EGREGIOUSLY MISTAKEN
HER MAJESTY LENT HER ATTENTION RATHER WITH THE CALM OF COURTESY THAN
THE EARNESTNESS OF INTEREST
THIS GENTLEMAN'S STATE OF MIND WAS VERY
HARROWING AND I WAS GLAD WHEN HE WOUND UP HIS MUSICAL EXPOSITION OF
THE SAME
SOME ROUSING CHORUSES STRUCK ME AS THE BEST PART OF THE EVENING'S
ENTERTAINMENT
THERE WERE PRESENT DEPUTIES FROM ALL THE BEST PROVINCIAL
CHORAL SOCIETIES GENUINE BARREL SHAPED NATIVE LABASSECOURIENS
THESE
WORTHIES GAVE VOICE WITHOUT MINCING THE MATTER THEIR HEARTY EXERTIONS
HAD AT LEAST THIS GOOD RESULT THE EAR DRANK THENCE A SATISFYING SENSE
OF POWER
THROUGH THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE TIMID INSTRUMENTAL DUETS CONCEITED
VOCAL SOLOS SONOROUS BRASS LUNGED CHORUSES MY ATTENTION GAVE BUT ONE
EYE AND ONE EAR TO THE STAGE THE OTHER BEING PERMANENTLY RETAINED IN
THE SERVICE OF DR
BRETTON I COULD NOT FORGET HIM NOR CEASE TO
QUESTION HOW HE WAS FEELING WHAT HE WAS THINKING WHETHER HE WAS
AMUSED OR THE CONTRARY
AT LAST HE SPOKE
AND HOW DO YOU LIKE IT ALL LUCY YOU ARE VERY QUIET HE SAID IN HIS
OWN CHEERFUL TONE
I AM QUIET I SAID BECAUSE I AM SO VERY VERY MUCH INTERESTED
NOT MERELY WITH THE MUSIC BUT WITH EVERYTHING ABOUT ME
HE THEN PROCEEDED TO MAKE SOME FURTHER REMARKS WITH SO MUCH EQUANIMITY
AND COMPOSURE THAT I BEGAN TO THINK HE HAD REALLY NOT SEEN WHAT I HAD
SEEN AND I WHISPERED MISS FANSHAWE IS HERE HAVE YOU NOTICED HER
OH YES AND I OBSERVED THAT YOU NOTICED HER TOO
IS SHE COME WITH MRS
CHOLMONDELEY DO YOU THINK
MRS
CHOLMONDELEY IS THERE WITH A VERY GRAND PARTY
YES GINEVRA WAS
IN HER TRAIN AND MRS
CHOLMONDELEY WAS IN LADY 'S TRAIN WHO WAS
IN THE QUEEN'S TRAIN
IF THIS WERE NOT ONE OF THE COMPACT LITTLE MINOR
EUROPEAN COURTS WHOSE VERY FORMALITIES ARE LITTLE MORE IMPOSING THAN
FAMILIARITIES AND WHOSE GALA GRANDEUR IS BUT HOMELINESS IN SUNDAY
ARRAY IT WOULD SOUND ALL VERY FINE
GINEVRA SAW YOU I THINK
SO DO I THINK SO
I HAVE HAD MY EYE ON HER SEVERAL TIMES SINCE YOU
WITHDREW YOURS AND I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR OF WITNESSING A LITTLE
SPECTACLE WHICH YOU WERE SPARED
I DID NOT ASK WHAT I WAITED VOLUNTARY INFORMATION WHICH WAS PRESENTLY
GIVEN
MISS FANSHAWE HE SAID HAS A COMPANION WITH HER A LADY OF RANK
I
HAPPEN TO KNOW LADY SARA BY SIGHT HER NOBLE MOTHER HAS CALLED ME IN
PROFESSIONALLY
SHE IS A PROUD GIRL BUT NOT IN THE LEAST INSOLENT AND
I DOUBT WHETHER GINEVRA WILL HAVE GAINED GROUND IN HER ESTIMATION BY
MAKING A BUTT OF HER NEIGHBOURS
WHAT NEIGHBOURS
MERELY MYSELF AND MY MOTHER
AS TO ME IT IS ALL VERY NATURAL NOTHING
I SUPPOSE CAN BE FAIRER GAME THAN THE YOUNG BOURGEOIS DOCTOR BUT MY
MOTHER I NEVER SAW HER RIDICULED BEFORE
DO YOU KNOW THE CURLING LIP
AND SARCASTICALLY LEVELLED GLASS THUS DIRECTED GAVE ME A MOST CURIOUS
SENSATION
THINK NOTHING OF IT DR
JOHN IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE
IF GINEVRA WERE
IN A GIDDY MOOD AS SHE IS EMINENTLY TO NIGHT SHE WOULD MAKE NO
SCRUPLE OF LAUGHING AT THAT MILD PENSIVE QUEEN OR THAT MELANCHOLY
KING
SHE IS NOT ACTUATED BY MALEVOLENCE BUT SHEER HEEDLESS FOLLY
TO
A FEATHER BRAINED SCHOOL GIRL NOTHING IS SACRED
BUT YOU FORGET I HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK ON MISS FANSHAWE IN
THE LIGHT OF A FEATHER BRAINED SCHOOL GIRL
WAS SHE NOT MY
DIVINITY THE ANGEL OF MY CAREER
HEM THERE WAS YOUR MISTAKE
TO SPEAK THE HONEST TRUTH WITHOUT ANY FALSE RANT OR ASSUMED ROMANCE
THERE ACTUALLY WAS A MOMENT SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN I THOUGHT HER DIVINE
DO YOU REMEMBER OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT THE PRESENTS I WAS NOT QUITE
OPEN WITH YOU IN DISCUSSING THAT SUBJECT THE WARMTH WITH WHICH YOU
TOOK IT UP AMUSED ME
BY WAY OF HAVING THE FULL BENEFIT OF YOUR LIGHTS
I ALLOWED YOU TO THINK ME MORE IN THE DARK THAN I REALLY WAS
IT WAS
THAT TEST OF THE PRESENTS WHICH FIRST PROVED GINEVRA MORTAL
STILL HER
BEAUTY RETAINED ITS FASCINATION THREE DAYS THREE HOURS AGO I WAS
VERY MUCH HER SLAVE
AS SHE PASSED ME TO NIGHT TRIUMPHANT IN BEAUTY
MY EMOTIONS DID HER HOMAGE BUT FOR ONE LUCKLESS SNEER I SHOULD YET BE
THE HUMBLEST OF HER SERVANTS
SHE MIGHT HAVE SCOFFED AT ME AND
WHILE WOUNDING SHE WOULD NOT SOON HAVE ALIENATED ME THROUGH MYSELF
SHE COULD NOT IN TEN YEARS HAVE DONE WHAT IN A MOMENT SHE HAS DONE
THROUGH MY MOTHER
HE HELD HIS PEACE AWHILE
NEVER BEFORE HAD I SEEN SO MUCH FIRE AND SO
LITTLE SUNSHINE IN DR
JOHN'S BLUE EYE AS JUST NOW
LUCY HE RECOMMENCED LOOK WELL AT MY MOTHER AND SAY WITHOUT FEAR
OR FAVOUR IN WHAT LIGHT SHE NOW APPEARS TO YOU
AS SHE ALWAYS DOES AN ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASS GENTLEWOMAN WELL THOUGH
GRAVELY DRESSED HABITUALLY INDEPENDENT OF PRETENCE CONSTITUTIONALLY
COMPOSED AND CHEERFUL
SO SHE SEEMS TO ME BLESS HER THE MERRY MAY LAUGH WITH MAMMA BUT
THE WEAK ONLY WILL LAUGH AT HER
SHE SHALL NOT BE RIDICULED WITH MY
CONSENT AT LEAST NOR WITHOUT MY MY SCORN MY ANTIPATHY MY
HE STOPPED AND IT WAS TIME FOR HE WAS GETTING EXCITED MORE IT SEEMED
THAN THE OCCASION WARRANTED
I DID NOT THEN KNOW THAT HE HAD WITNESSED
DOUBLE CAUSE FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH MISS FANSHAWE
THE GLOW OF HIS
COMPLEXION THE EXPANSION OF HIS NOSTRIL THE BOLD CURVE WHICH DISDAIN
GAVE HIS WELL CUT UNDER LIP SHOWED HIM IN A NEW AND STRIKING PHASE
YET THE RARE PASSION OF THE CONSTITUTIONALLY SUAVE AND SERENE IS NOT A
PLEASANT SPECTACLE NOR DID I LIKE THE SORT OF VINDICTIVE THRILL WHICH
PASSED THROUGH HIS STRONG YOUNG FRAME
DO I FRIGHTEN YOU LUCY HE ASKED
I CANNOT TELL WHY YOU ARE SO VERY ANGRY
FOR THIS REASON HE MUTTERED IN MY EAR
GINEVRA IS NEITHER A PURE
ANGEL NOR A PURE MINDED WOMAN
NONSENSE YOU EXAGGERATE SHE HAS NO GREAT HARM IN HER
TOO MUCH FOR ME
I CAN SEE WHERE YOU ARE BLIND
NOW DISMISS THE
SUBJECT
LET ME AMUSE MYSELF BY TEASING MAMMA I WILL ASSERT THAT SHE
IS FLAGGING
MAMMA PRAY ROUSE YOURSELF
JOHN I WILL CERTAINLY ROUSE YOU IF YOU ARE NOT BETTER CONDUCTED
WILL
YOU AND LUCY BE SILENT THAT I MAY HEAR THE SINGING
THEY WERE THEN THUNDERING IN A CHORUS UNDER COVER OF WHICH ALL THE
PREVIOUS DIALOGUE HAD TAKEN PLACE
YOU HEAR THE SINGING MAMMA NOW I WILL WAGER MY STUDS WHICH ARE
GENUINE AGAINST YOUR PASTE BROOCH
MY PASTE BROOCH GRAHAM PROFANE BOY YOU KNOW THAT IT IS A STONE OF
VALUE
OH THAT IS ONE OF YOUR SUPERSTITIONS YOU WERE CHEATED IN THE
BUSINESS
I AM CHEATED IN FEWER THINGS THAN YOU IMAGINE
HOW DO YOU HAPPEN TO BE
ACQUAINTED WITH YOUNG LADIES OF THE COURT JOHN I HAVE OBSERVED TWO OF
THEM PAY YOU NO SMALL ATTENTION DURING THE LAST HALF HOUR
I WISH YOU WOULD NOT OBSERVE THEM
WHY NOT BECAUSE ONE OF THEM SATIRICALLY LEVELS HER EYEGLASS AT ME
SHE IS A PRETTY SILLY GIRL BUT ARE YOU APPREHENSIVE THAT HER TITTER
WILL DISCOMFIT THE OLD LADY
THE SENSIBLE ADMIRABLE OLD LADY MOTHER YOU ARE BETTER TO ME THAN
TEN WIVES YET
DON'T BE DEMONSTRATIVE JOHN OR I SHALL FAINT AND YOU WILL HAVE TO
CARRY ME OUT AND IF THAT BURDEN WERE LAID UPON YOU YOU WOULD REVERSE
YOUR LAST SPEECH AND EXCLAIM 'MOTHER TEN WIVES COULD HARDLY BE WORSE
TO ME THAN YOU ARE
THE CONCERT OVER THE LOTTERY AU BNFICE DES PAUVRES CAME NEXT THE
INTERVAL BETWEEN WAS ONE OF GENERAL RELAXATION AND THE PLEASANTEST
IMAGINABLE STIR AND COMMOTION
THE WHITE FLOCK WAS CLEARED FROM THE
PLATFORM A BUSY THRONG OF GENTLEMEN CROWDED IT INSTEAD MAKING
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DRAWING AND AMONGST THESE THE BUSIEST OF
ALL RE APPEARED THAT CERTAIN WELL KNOWN FORM NOT TALL BUT ACTIVE
ALIVE WITH THE ENERGY AND MOVEMENT OF THREE TALL MEN
HOW M
PAUL DID
WORK HOW HE ISSUED DIRECTIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME SET HIS OWN
SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL HALF A DOZEN ASSISTANTS WERE AT HIS BECK TO
REMOVE THE PIANOS C NO MATTER HE MUST ADD TO THEIR STRENGTH HIS
OWN
THE REDUNDANCY OF HIS ALERTNESS WAS HALF VEXING HALF LUDICROUS
IN MY MIND I BOTH DISAPPROVED AND DERIDED MOST OF THIS FUSS
YET IN
THE MIDST OF PREJUDICE AND ANNOYANCE I COULD NOT WHILE WATCHING
AVOID PERCEIVING A CERTAIN NOT DISAGREEABLE NAVET IN ALL HE DID AND
SAID NOR COULD I BE BLIND TO CERTAIN VIGOROUS CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS
PHYSIOGNOMY RENDERED CONSPICUOUS NOW BY THE CONTRAST WITH A THRONG OF
TAMER FACES THE DEEP INTENT KEENNESS OF HIS EYE THE POWER OF HIS
FOREHEAD PALE BROAD AND FULL THE MOBILITY OF HIS MOST FLEXIBLE
MOUTH
HE LACKED THE CALM OF FORCE BUT ITS MOVEMENT AND ITS FIRE HE
SIGNALLY POSSESSED
MEANTIME THE WHOLE HALL WAS IN A STIR MOST PEOPLE ROSE AND REMAINED
STANDING FOR A CHANGE SOME WALKED ABOUT ALL TALKED AND LAUGHED
THE
CRIMSON COMPARTMENT PRESENTED A PECULIARLY ANIMATED SCENE
THE LONG
CLOUD OF GENTLEMEN BREAKING INTO FRAGMENTS MIXED WITH THE RAINBOW
LINE OF LADIES TWO OR THREE OFFICER LIKE MEN APPROACHED THE KING AND
CONVERSED WITH HIM
THE QUEEN LEAVING HER CHAIR GLIDED ALONG THE RANK
OF YOUNG LADIES WHO ALL STOOD UP AS SHE PASSED AND TO EACH IN TURN I
SAW HER VOUCHSAFE SOME TOKEN OF KINDNESS A GRACIOUS WORD LOOK OR
SMILE
TO THE TWO PRETTY ENGLISH GIRLS LADY SARA AND GINEVRA FANSHAWE
SHE ADDRESSED SEVERAL SENTENCES AS SHE LEFT THEM BOTH AND ESPECIALLY
THE LATTER SEEMED TO GLOW ALL OVER WITH GRATIFICATION
THEY WERE
AFTERWARDS ACCOSTED BY SEVERAL LADIES AND A LITTLE CIRCLE OF GENTLEMEN
GATHERED ROUND THEM AMONGST THESE THE NEAREST TO GINEVRA STOOD THE
COUNT DE HAMAL
THIS ROOM IS STIFLINGLY HOT SAID DR
BRETTON RISING WITH SUDDEN
IMPATIENCE
LUCY MOTHER WILL YOU COME A MOMENT TO THE FRESH AIR
GO WITH HIM LUCY SAID MRS
BRETTON
I WOULD RATHER KEEP MY SEAT
WILLINGLY WOULD I HAVE KEPT MINE ALSO BUT GRAHAM'S DESIRE MUST TAKE
PRECEDENCE OF MY OWN I ACCOMPANIED HIM
WE FOUND THE NIGHT AIR KEEN OR AT LEAST I DID HE DID NOT SEEM TO FEEL
IT BUT IT WAS VERY STILL AND THE STAR SOWN SKY SPREAD CLOUDLESS
I
WAS WRAPPED IN A FUR SHAWL
WE TOOK SOME TURNS ON THE PAVEMENT IN
PASSING UNDER A LAMP GRAHAM ENCOUNTERED MY EYE
YOU LOOK PENSIVE LUCY IS IT ON MY ACCOUNT
I WAS ONLY FEARING THAT YOU WERE GRIEVED
NOT AT ALL SO BE OF GOOD CHEER AS I AM
WHENEVER I DIE LUCY MY
PERSUASION IS THAT IT WILL NOT BE OF HEART COMPLAINT
I MAY BE STUNG I
MAY SEEM TO DROOP FOR A TIME BUT NO PAIN OR MALADY OF SENTIMENT HAS
YET GONE THROUGH MY WHOLE SYSTEM
YOU HAVE ALWAYS SEEN ME CHEERFUL AT
HOME
GENERALLY
I AM GLAD SHE LAUGHED AT MY MOTHER
I WOULD NOT GIVE THE OLD LADY FOR
A DOZEN BEAUTIES
THAT SNEER DID ME ALL THE GOOD IN THE WORLD
THANK
YOU MISS FANSHAWE AND HE LIFTED HIS HAT FROM HIS WAVED LOCKS AND
MADE A MOCK REVERENCE
YES HE SAID I THANK HER
SHE HAS MADE ME FEEL THAT NINE PARTS IN
TEN OF MY HEART HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SOUND AS A BELL AND THE TENTH BLED
FROM A MERE PUNCTURE A LANCET PRICK THAT WILL HEAL IN A TRICE
YOU ARE ANGRY JUST NOW HEATED AND INDIGNANT YOU WILL THINK AND FEEL
DIFFERENTLY TO MORROW
I HEATED AND INDIGNANT YOU DON'T KNOW ME
ON THE CONTRARY THE HEAT
IS GONE I AM AS COOL AS THE NIGHT WHICH BY THE WAY MAY BE TOO COOL
FOR YOU
WE WILL GO BACK
DR
JOHN THIS IS A SUDDEN CHANGE
NOT IT OR IF IT BE THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR IT TWO GOOD REASONS
I HAVE TOLD YOU ONE
BUT NOW LET US RE ENTER
WE DID NOT EASILY REGAIN OUR SEATS THE LOTTERY WAS BEGUN AND ALL WAS
EXCITED CONFUSION CROWDS BLOCKED THE SORT OF CORRIDOR ALONG WHICH WE
HAD TO PASS IT WAS NECESSARY TO PAUSE FOR A TIME
HAPPENING TO GLANCE
ROUND INDEED I HALF FANCIED I HEARD MY NAME PRONOUNCED I SAW QUITE
NEAR THE UBIQUITOUS THE INEVITABLE M
PAUL
HE WAS LOOKING AT ME
GRAVELY AND INTENTLY AT ME OR RATHER AT MY PINK DRESS SARDONIC
COMMENT ON WHICH GLEAMED IN HIS EYE
NOW IT WAS HIS HABIT TO INDULGE IN
STRICTURES ON THE DRESS BOTH OF THE TEACHERS AND PUPILS AT MADAME
BECK'S A HABIT WHICH THE FORMER AT LEAST HELD TO BE AN OFFENSIVE
IMPERTINENCE AS YET I HAD NOT SUFFERED FROM IT MY SOMBRE DAILY ATTIRE
NOT BEING CALCULATED TO ATTRACT NOTICE
I WAS IN NO MOOD TO PERMIT ANY
NEW ENCROACHMENT TO NIGHT RATHER THAN ACCEPT HIS BANTER I WOULD
IGNORE HIS PRESENCE AND ACCORDINGLY STEADILY TURNED MY FACE TO THE
SLEEVE OF DR
JOHN'S COAT FINDING IN THAT SAME BLACK SLEEVE A PROSPECT
MORE REDOLENT OF PLEASURE AND COMFORT MORE GENIAL MORE FRIENDLY I
THOUGHT THAN WAS OFFERED BY THE DARK LITTLE PROFESSOR'S UNLOVELY
VISAGE
DR
JOHN SEEMED UNCONSCIOUSLY TO SANCTION THE PREFERENCE BY
LOOKING DOWN AND SAYING IN HIS KIND VOICE AY KEEP CLOSE TO MY SIDE
LUCY THESE CROWDING BURGHERS ARE NO RESPECTERS OF PERSONS
I COULD NOT HOWEVER BE TRUE TO MYSELF
YIELDING TO SOME INFLUENCE
MESMERIC OR OTHERWISE AN INFLUENCE UNWELCOME DISPLEASING BUT
EFFECTIVE I AGAIN GLANCED ROUND TO SEE IF M
PAUL WAS GONE
NO THERE
HE STOOD ON THE SAME SPOT LOOKING STILL BUT WITH A CHANGED EYE HE
HAD PENETRATED MY THOUGHT AND READ MY WISH TO SHUN HIM
THE MOCKING
BUT NOT ILL HUMOURED GAZE WAS TURNED TO A SWARTHY FROWN AND WHEN I
BOWED WITH A VIEW TO CONCILIATION I GOT ONLY THE STIFFEST AND
STERNEST OF NODS IN RETURN
WHOM HAVE YOU MADE ANGRY LUCY WHISPERED DR
BRETTON SMILING
WHO
IS THAT SAVAGE LOOKING FRIEND OF YOURS
ONE OF THE PROFESSORS AT MADAME BECK'S A VERY CROSS LITTLE MAN
HE LOOKS MIGHTY CROSS JUST NOW WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIM WHAT IS IT
ALL ABOUT AH LUCY LUCY TELL ME THE MEANING OF THIS
NO MYSTERY I ASSURE YOU
M
EMANUEL IS VERY EXIGEANT AND BECAUSE I
LOOKED AT YOUR COAT SLEEVE INSTEAD OF CURTSEYING AND DIPPING TO HIM
HE THINKS I HAVE FAILED IN RESPECT
THE LITTLE BEGAN DR
JOHN I KNOW NOT WHAT MORE HE WOULD HAVE
ADDED FOR AT THAT MOMENT I WAS NEARLY THROWN DOWN AMONGST THE FEET OF
THE CROWD
M
PAUL HAD RUDELY PUSHED PAST AND WAS ELBOWING HIS WAY
WITH SUCH UTTER DISREGARD TO THE CONVENIENCE AND SECURITY OF ALL
AROUND THAT A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE PRESSURE WAS THE CONSEQUENCE
I THINK HE IS WHAT HE HIMSELF WOULD CALL 'MCHANT SAID DR
BRETTON
I THOUGHT SO TOO
SLOWLY AND WITH DIFFICULTY WE MADE OUR WAY ALONG THE PASSAGE AND AT
LAST REGAINED OUR SEATS
THE DRAWING OF THE LOTTERY LASTED NEARLY AN
HOUR IT WAS AN ANIMATING AND AMUSING SCENE AND AS WE EACH HELD
TICKETS WE SHARED IN THE ALTERNATIONS OF HOPE AND FEAR RAISED BY EACH
TURN OF THE WHEEL
TWO LITTLE GIRLS OF FIVE AND SIX YEARS OLD DREW
THE NUMBERS AND THE PRIZES WERE DULY PROCLAIMED FROM THE PLATFORM
THESE PRIZES WERE NUMEROUS THOUGH OF SMALL VALUE
IT SO FELL OUT THAT
DR
JOHN AND I EACH GAINED ONE MINE WAS A CIGAR CASE HIS A LADY'S
HEAD DRESS A MOST AIRY SORT OF BLUE AND SILVER TURBAN WITH A STREAMER
OF PLUMAGE ON ONE SIDE LIKE A SNOWY CLOUD
HE WAS EXCESSIVELY ANXIOUS
TO MAKE AN EXCHANGE BUT I COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO HEAR REASON AND TO
THIS DAY I KEEP MY CIGAR CASE IT SERVES WHEN I LOOK AT IT TO REMIND
ME OF OLD TIMES AND ONE HAPPY EVENING
DR
JOHN FOR HIS PART HELD HIS TURBAN AT ARM'S LENGTH BETWEEN HIS
FINGER AND THUMB AND LOOKED AT IT WITH A MIXTURE OF REVERENCE AND
EMBARRASSMENT HIGHLY PROVOCATIVE OF LAUGHTER
THE CONTEMPLATION OVER
HE WAS ABOUT COOLLY TO DEPOSIT THE DELICATE FABRIC ON THE GROUND
BETWEEN HIS FEET HE SEEMED TO HAVE NO SHADOW OF AN IDEA OF THE
TREATMENT OR STOWAGE IT OUGHT TO RECEIVE IF HIS MOTHER HAD NOT COME TO
THE RESCUE I THINK HE WOULD FINALLY HAVE CRUSHED IT UNDER HIS ARM LIKE
AN OPERA HAT SHE RESTORED IT TO THE BAND BOX WHENCE IT HAD ISSUED
GRAHAM WAS QUITE CHEERFUL ALL THE EVENING AND HIS CHEERFULNESS SEEMED
NATURAL AND UNFORCED
HIS DEMEANOUR HIS LOOK IS NOT EASILY DESCRIBED
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN IT PECULIAR AND IN ITS WAY ORIGINAL
I READ
IN IT NO COMMON MASTERY OF THE PASSIONS AND A FUND OF DEEP AND HEALTHY
STRENGTH WHICH WITHOUT ANY EXHAUSTING EFFORT BORE DOWN DISAPPOINTMENT
AND EXTRACTED HER FANG
HIS MANNER NOW REMINDED ME OF QUALITIES I HAD
NOTICED IN HIM WHEN PROFESSIONALLY ENGAGED AMONGST THE POOR THE
GUILTY AND THE SUFFERING IN THE BASSE VILLE HE LOOKED AT ONCE
DETERMINED ENDURING AND SWEET TEMPERED
WHO COULD HELP LIKING HIM
HE BETRAYED NO WEAKNESS WHICH HARASSED ALL YOUR FEELINGS WITH
CONSIDERATIONS AS TO HOW ITS FALTERING MUST BE PROPPED FROM HIM
BROKE NO IRRITABILITY WHICH STARTLED CALM AND QUENCHED MIRTH HIS
LIPS LET FALL NO CAUSTIC THAT BURNED TO THE BONE HIS EYE SHOT NO
MOROSE SHAFTS THAT WENT COLD AND RUSTY AND VENOMED THROUGH YOUR
HEART BESIDE HIM WAS REST AND REFUGE AROUND HIM FOSTERING SUNSHINE
AND YET HE HAD NEITHER FORGIVEN NOR FORGOTTEN MISS FANSHAWE
ONCE
ANGERED I DOUBT IF DR
BRETTON WERE TO BE SOON PROPITIATED ONCE
ALIENATED WHETHER HE WERE EVER TO BE RECLAIMED
HE LOOKED AT HER MORE
THAN ONCE NOT STEALTHILY OR HUMBLY BUT WITH A MOVEMENT OF HARDY OPEN
OBSERVATION
DE HAMAL WAS NOW A FIXTURE BESIDE HER MRS
CHOLMONDELEY
SAT NEAR AND THEY AND SHE WERE WHOLLY ABSORBED IN THE DISCOURSE
MIRTH AND EXCITEMENT WITH WHICH THE CRIMSON SEATS WERE AS MUCH ASTIR
AS ANY PLEBEIAN PART OF THE HALL
IN THE COURSE OF SOME APPARENTLY
ANIMATED DISCUSSION GINEVRA ONCE OR TWICE LIFTED HER HAND AND ARM A
HANDSOME BRACELET GLEAMED UPON THE LATTER
I SAW THAT ITS GLEAM
FLICKERED IN DR
JOHN'S EYE QUICKENING THEREIN A DERISIVE IREFUL
SPARKLE HE LAUGHED
I THINK HE SAID I WILL LAY MY TURBAN ON MY WONTED ALTAR OF
OFFERINGS THERE AT ANY RATE IT WOULD BE CERTAIN TO FIND FAVOUR NO
GRISETTE HAS A MORE FACILE FACULTY OF ACCEPTANCE
STRANGE FOR AFTER
ALL I KNOW SHE IS A GIRL OF FAMILY
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HER EDUCATION DR
JOHN SAID I
TOSSED ABOUT ALL
HER LIFE FROM ONE FOREIGN SCHOOL TO ANOTHER SHE MAY JUSTLY PROFFER THE
PLEA OF IGNORANCE IN EXTENUATION OF MOST OF HER FAULTS
AND THEN FROM
WHAT SHE SAYS I BELIEVE HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE BROUGHT UP MUCH AS
SHE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP
I ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD SHE HAD NO FORTUNE AND ONCE I HAD PLEASURE IN THE
THOUGHT SAID HE
SHE TELLS ME I ANSWERED THAT THEY ARE POOR AT HOME SHE ALWAYS
SPEAKS QUITE CANDIDLY ON SUCH POINTS YOU NEVER FIND HER LYING AS
THESE FOREIGNERS WILL OFTEN LIE
HER PARENTS HAVE A LARGE FAMILY THEY
OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AND POSSESS SUCH CONNECTIONS AS IN THEIR
OPINION DEMAND DISPLAY STRINGENT NECESSITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND
INHERENT THOUGHTLESSNESS OF DISPOSITION COMBINED HAVE ENGENDERED
RECKLESS UNSCRUPULOUSNESS AS TO HOW THEY OBTAIN THE MEANS OF SUSTAINING
A GOOD APPEARANCE
THIS IS THE STATE OF THINGS AND THE ONLY STATE OF
THINGS SHE HAS SEEN FROM CHILDHOOD UPWARDS
I BELIEVE IT AND I THOUGHT TO MOULD HER TO SOMETHING BETTER BUT
LUCY TO SPEAK THE PLAIN TRUTH I HAVE FELT A NEW THING TO NIGHT IN
LOOKING AT HER AND DE HAMAL
I FELT IT BEFORE NOTICING THE IMPERTINENCE
DIRECTED AT MY MOTHER
I SAW A LOOK INTERCHANGED BETWEEN THEM
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR ENTRANCE WHICH THREW A MOST UNWELCOME LIGHT ON
MY MIND
HOW DO YOU MEAN YOU HAVE BEEN LONG AWARE OF THE FLIRTATION THEY KEEP
UP
AY FLIRTATION THAT MIGHT BE AN INNOCENT GIRLISH WILE TO LURE ON THE
TRUE LOVER BUT WHAT I REFER TO WAS NOT FLIRTATION IT WAS A LOOK
MARKING MUTUAL AND SECRET UNDERSTANDING IT WAS NEITHER GIRLISH NOR
INNOCENT
NO WOMAN WERE SHE AS BEAUTIFUL AS APHRODITE WHO COULD GIVE
OR RECEIVE SUCH A GLANCE SHALL EVER BE SOUGHT IN MARRIAGE BY ME I
WOULD RATHER WED A PAYSANNE IN A SHORT PETTICOAT AND HIGH CAP AND BE
SURE THAT SHE WAS HONEST
I COULD NOT HELP SMILING
I FELT SURE HE NOW EXAGGERATED THE CASE
GINEVRA I WAS CERTAIN WAS HONEST ENOUGH WITH ALL HER GIDDINESS
I
TOLD HIM SO
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID HE WOULD NOT BE THE MAN TO
TRUST HER WITH HIS HONOUR
THE ONLY THING SAID I WITH WHICH YOU MAY SAFELY TRUST HER
SHE
WOULD UNSCRUPULOUSLY DAMAGE A HUSBAND'S PURSE AND PROPERTY RECKLESSLY
TRY HIS PATIENCE AND TEMPER I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD BREATHE OR LET
ANOTHER BREATHE ON HIS HONOUR
YOU ARE BECOMING HER ADVOCATE SAID HE
DO YOU WISH ME TO RESUME MY
OLD CHAINS
NO I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU FREE AND TRUST THAT FREE YOU WILL LONG
REMAIN
YET BE AT THE SAME TIME JUST
I AM SO JUST AS RHADAMANTHUS LUCY
WHEN ONCE I AM THOROUGHLY
ESTRANGED I CANNOT HELP BEING SEVERE
BUT LOOK THE KING AND QUEEN ARE
RISING
I LIKE THAT QUEEN SHE HAS A SWEET COUNTENANCE
MAMMA TOO IS
EXCESSIVELY TIRED WE SHALL NEVER GET THE OLD LADY HOME IF WE STAY
LONGER
I TIRED JOHN CRIED MRS
BRETTON LOOKING AT LEAST AS ANIMATED AND
AS WIDE AWAKE AS HER SON
I WOULD UNDERTAKE TO SIT YOU OUT YET LEAVE
US BOTH HERE TILL MORNING AND WE SHOULD SEE WHICH WOULD LOOK THE MOST
JADED BY SUNRISE
I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT FOR IN TRUTH MAMMA YOU ARE
THE MOST UNFADING OF EVERGREENS AND THE FRESHEST OF MATRONS
IT MUST
THEN BE ON THE PLEA OF YOUR SON'S DELICATE NERVES AND FRAGILE
CONSTITUTION THAT I FOUND A PETITION FOR OUR SPEEDY ADJOURNMENT
INDOLENT YOUNG MAN YOU WISH YOU WERE IN BED NO DOUBT AND I SUPPOSE
YOU MUST BE HUMOURED
THERE IS LUCY TOO LOOKING QUITE DONE UP
FOR
SHAME LUCY AT YOUR AGE A WEEK OF EVENINGS OUT WOULD NOT HAVE MADE ME
A SHADE PALER
COME AWAY BOTH OF YOU AND YOU MAY LAUGH AT THE OLD
LADY AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE BUT FOR MY PART I SHALL TAKE CHARGE OF
THE BANDBOX AND TURBAN
WHICH SHE DID ACCORDINGLY
I OFFERED TO RELIEVE HER BUT WAS SHAKEN OFF
WITH KINDLY CONTEMPT MY GODMOTHER OPINED THAT I HAD ENOUGH TO DO TO
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF
NOT STANDING ON CEREMONY NOW IN THE MIDST OF THE
GAY CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED SUCCEEDING TO THE KING AND QUEEN'S
DEPARTURE MRS
BRETTON PRECEDED US AND PROMPTLY MADE US A LANE
THROUGH THE CROWD
GRAHAM FOLLOWED APOSTROPHIZING HIS MOTHER AS THE
MOST FLOURISHING GRISETTE IT HAD EVER BEEN HIS GOOD FORTUNE TO SEE
CHARGED WITH CARRIAGE OF A BANDBOX HE ALSO DESIRED ME TO MARK HER
AFFECTION FOR THE SKY BLUE TURBAN AND ANNOUNCED HIS CONVICTION THAT
SHE INTENDED ONE DAY TO WEAR IT
THE NIGHT WAS NOW VERY COLD AND VERY DARK BUT WITH LITTLE DELAY WE
FOUND THE CARRIAGE
SOON WE WERE PACKED IN IT AS WARM AND AS SNUG AS
AT A FIRE SIDE AND THE DRIVE HOME WAS I THINK STILL PLEASANTER THAN
THE DRIVE TO THE CONCERT
PLEASANT IT WAS EVEN THOUGH THE
COACHMAN HAVING SPENT IN THE SHOP OF A MARCHAND DE VIN A PORTION OF
THE TIME WE PASSED AT THE CONCERT DROVE US ALONG THE DARK AND SOLITARY
CHAUSSE FAR PAST THE TURN LEADING DOWN TO LA TERRASSE WE WHO WERE
OCCUPIED IN TALKING AND LAUGHING NOT NOTICING THE ABERRATION TILL AT
LAST MRS
BRETTON INTIMATED THAT THOUGH SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT THE
CHTEAU A RETIRED SPOT SHE DID NOT KNOW IT WAS SITUATED AT THE WORLD'S
END AS SHE DECLARED SEEMED NOW TO BE THE CASE FOR SHE BELIEVED WE HAD
BEEN AN HOUR AND A HALF EN ROUTE AND HAD NOT YET TAKEN THE TURN DOWN
THE AVENUE
THEN GRAHAM LOOKED OUT AND PERCEIVING ONLY DIM SPREAD FIELDS WITH
UNFAMILIAR ROWS OF POLLARDS AND LIMES RANGED ALONG THEIR ELSE INVISIBLE
SUNK FENCES BEGAN TO CONJECTURE HOW MATTERS WERE AND CALLING A HALT
AND DESCENDING HE MOUNTED THE BOX AND TOOK THE REINS HIMSELF
THANKS
TO HIM WE ARRIVED SAFE AT HOME ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF BEYOND OUR
TIME
MARTHA HAD NOT FORGOTTEN US A CHEERFUL FIRE WAS BURNING AND A NEAT
SUPPER SPREAD IN THE DINING ROOM WE WERE GLAD OF BOTH
THE WINTER DAWN
WAS ACTUALLY BREAKING BEFORE WE GAINED OUR CHAMBERS
I TOOK OFF MY PINK
DRESS AND LACE MANTLE WITH HAPPIER FEELINGS THAN I HAD EXPERIENCED IN
PUTTING THEM ON
NOT ALL PERHAPS WHO HAD SHONE BRIGHTLY ARRAYED AT
THAT CONCERT COULD SAY THE SAME FOR NOT ALL HAD BEEN SATISFIED WITH
FRIENDSHIP WITH ITS CALM COMFORT AND MODEST HOPE
CHAPTER XXI
REACTION
YET THREE DAYS AND THEN I MUST GO BACK TO THE PENSIONNAT
I ALMOST
NUMBERED THE MOMENTS OF THESE DAYS UPON THE CLOCK FAIN WOULD I HAVE
RETARDED THEIR FLIGHT BUT THEY GLIDED BY WHILE I WATCHED THEM THEY
WERE ALREADY GONE WHILE I YET FEARED THEIR DEPARTURE
LUCY WILL NOT LEAVE US TO DAY SAID MRS
BRETTON COAXINGLY AT
BREAKFAST SHE KNOWS WE CAN PROCURE A SECOND RESPITE
I WOULD NOT ASK FOR ONE IF I MIGHT HAVE IT FOR A WORD SAID I
I
LONG TO GET THE GOOD BY OVER AND TO BE SETTLED IN THE RUE FOSSETTE
AGAIN
I MUST GO THIS MORNING I MUST GO DIRECTLY MY TRUNK IS PACKED
AND CORDED
IT APPEARED HOWEVER THAT MY GOING DEPENDED UPON GRAHAM HE HAD SAID
HE WOULD ACCOMPANY ME AND IT SO FELL OUT THAT HE WAS ENGAGED ALL DAY
AND ONLY RETURNED HOME AT DUSK
THEN ENSUED A LITTLE COMBAT OF WORDS
MRS
BRETTON AND HER SON PRESSED ME TO REMAIN ONE NIGHT MORE
I COULD
HAVE CRIED SO IRRITATED AND EAGER WAS I TO BE GONE
I LONGED TO LEAVE
THEM AS THE CRIMINAL ON THE SCAFFOLD LONGS FOR THE AXE TO DESCEND THAT
IS I WISHED THE PANG OVER
HOW MUCH I WISHED IT THEY COULD NOT TELL
ON THESE POINTS MINE WAS A STATE OF MIND OUT OF THEIR EXPERIENCE
IT WAS DARK WHEN DR
JOHN HANDED ME FROM THE CARRIAGE AT MADAME BECK'S
DOOR
THE LAMP ABOVE WAS LIT IT RAINED A NOVEMBER DRIZZLE AS IT HAD
RAINED ALL DAY THE LAMPLIGHT GLEAMED ON THE WET PAVEMENT
JUST SUCH A
NIGHT WAS IT AS THAT ON WHICH NOT A YEAR AGO I HAD FIRST STOPPED AT
THIS VERY THRESHOLD JUST SIMILAR WAS THE SCENE
I REMEMBERED THE VERY
SHAPES OF THE PAVING STONES WHICH I HAD NOTED WITH IDLE EYE WHILE
WITH A THICK BEATING HEART I WAITED THE UNCLOSING OF THAT DOOR AT
WHICH I STOOD A SOLITARY AND A SUPPLIANT
ON THAT NIGHT TOO I HAD
BRIEFLY MET HIM WHO NOW STOOD WITH ME
HAD I EVER REMINDED HIM OF THAT
RENCONTRE OR EXPLAINED IT I HAD NOT NOR EVER FELT THE INCLINATION TO
DO SO IT WAS A PLEASANT THOUGHT LAID BY IN MY OWN MIND AND BEST KEPT
THERE
GRAHAM RUNG THE BELL
THE DOOR WAS INSTANTLY OPENED FOR IT WAS JUST
THAT PERIOD OF THE EVENING WHEN THE HALF BOARDERS TOOK THEIR
DEPARTURE CONSEQUENTLY ROSINE WAS ON THE ALERT
DON'T COME IN SAID I TO HIM BUT HE STEPPED A MOMENT INTO THE
WELL LIGHTED VESTIBULE
I HAD NOT WISHED HIM TO SEE THAT THE WATER
STOOD IN MY EYES FOR HIS WAS TOO KIND A NATURE EVER TO BE NEEDLESSLY
SHOWN SUCH SIGNS OF SORROW
HE ALWAYS WISHED TO HEAL TO RELIEVE WHEN
PHYSICIAN AS HE WAS NEITHER CURE NOR ALLEVIATION WERE PERHAPS IN HIS
POWER
KEEP UP YOUR COURAGE LUCY
THINK OF MY MOTHER AND MYSELF AS TRUE
FRIENDS
WE WILL NOT FORGET YOU
NOR WILL I FORGET YOU DR
JOHN
MY TRUNK WAS NOW BROUGHT IN
WE HAD SHAKEN HANDS HE HAD TURNED TO GO
BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED HE HAD NOT DONE OR SAID ENOUGH TO CONTENT HIS
GENEROUS IMPULSES
LUCY STEPPING AFTER ME SHALL YOU FEEL VERY SOLITARY HERE
AT FIRST I SHALL
WELL MY MOTHER WILL SOON CALL TO SEE YOU AND MEANTIME I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT I'LL DO
I'LL WRITE JUST ANY CHEERFUL NONSENSE THAT COMES
INTO MY HEAD SHALL I
GOOD GALLANT HEART THOUGHT I TO MYSELF BUT I SHOOK MY HEAD
SMILING AND SAID NEVER THINK OF IT IMPOSE ON YOURSELF NO SUCH TASK
YOU WRITE TO ME YOU'LL NOT HAVE TIME
OH I WILL FIND OR MAKE TIME
GOOD BY
HE WAS GONE
THE HEAVY DOOR CRASHED TO THE AXE HAD FALLEN THE PANG
WAS EXPERIENCED
ALLOWING MYSELF NO TIME TO THINK OR FEEL SWALLOWING TEARS AS IF THEY
HAD BEEN WINE I PASSED TO MADAME'S SITTING ROOM TO PAY THE NECESSARY
VISIT OF CEREMONY AND RESPECT
SHE RECEIVED ME WITH PERFECTLY
WELL ACTED CORDIALITY WAS EVEN DEMONSTRATIVE THOUGH BRIEF IN HER
WELCOME
IN TEN MINUTES I WAS DISMISSED
FROM THE SALLE MANGER I
PROCEEDED TO THE REFECTORY WHERE PUPILS AND TEACHERS WERE NOW
ASSEMBLED FOR EVENING STUDY AGAIN I HAD A WELCOME AND ONE NOT I
THINK QUITE HOLLOW
THAT OVER I WAS FREE TO REPAIR TO THE DORMITORY
AND WILL GRAHAM REALLY WRITE I QUESTIONED AS I SANK TIRED ON THE
EDGE OF THE BED
REASON COMING STEALTHILY UP TO ME THROUGH THE TWILIGHT OF THAT LONG
DIM CHAMBER WHISPERED SEDATELY HE MAY WRITE ONCE
SO KIND IS HIS
NATURE IT MAY STIMULATE HIM FOR ONCE TO MAKE THE EFFORT
BUT IT
CANNOT BE CONTINUED IT MAY NOT BE REPEATED
GREAT WERE THAT FOLLY
WHICH SHOULD BUILD ON SUCH A PROMISE INSANE THAT CREDULITY WHICH
SHOULD MISTAKE THE TRANSITORY RAIN POOL HOLDING IN ITS HOLLOW ONE
DRAUGHT FOR THE PERENNIAL SPRING YIELDING THE SUPPLY OF SEASONS
I BENT MY HEAD I SAT THINKING AN HOUR LONGER
REASON STILL WHISPERED
ME LAYING ON MY SHOULDER A WITHERED HAND AND FROSTILY TOUCHING MY EAR
WITH THE CHILL BLUE LIPS OF ELD
IF MUTTERED SHE IF HE SHOULD WRITE WHAT THEN DO YOU MEDITATE
PLEASURE IN REPLYING AH FOOL I WARN YOU BRIEF BE YOUR ANSWER
HOPE
NO DELIGHT OF HEART NO INDULGENCE OF INTELLECT GRANT NO EXPANSION TO
FEELING GIVE HOLIDAY TO NO SINGLE FACULTY DALLY WITH NO FRIENDLY
EXCHANGE FOSTER NO GENIAL INTERCOMMUNION
BUT I HAVE TALKED TO GRAHAM AND YOU DID NOT CHIDE I PLEADED
NO SAID SHE I NEEDED NOT
TALK FOR YOU IS GOOD DISCIPLINE
YOU
CONVERSE IMPERFECTLY
WHILE YOU SPEAK THERE CAN BE NO OBLIVION OF
INFERIORITY NO ENCOURAGEMENT TO DELUSION PAIN PRIVATION PENURY
STAMP YOUR LANGUAGE
BUT I AGAIN BROKE IN WHERE THE BODILY PRESENCE IS WEAK AND THE
SPEECH CONTEMPTIBLE SURELY THERE CANNOT BE ERROR IN MAKING WRITTEN
LANGUAGE THE MEDIUM OF BETTER UTTERANCE THAN FALTERING LIPS CAN
ACHIEVE
REASON ONLY ANSWERED AT YOUR PERIL YOU CHERISH THAT IDEA OR SUFFER
ITS INFLUENCE TO ANIMATE ANY WRITING OF YOURS
BUT IF I FEEL MAY I NEVER EXPRESS
NEVER DECLARED REASON
I GROANED UNDER HER BITTER STERNNESS
NEVER NEVER OH HARD WORD THIS
HAG THIS REASON WOULD NOT LET ME LOOK UP OR SMILE OR HOPE SHE
COULD NOT REST UNLESS I WERE ALTOGETHER CRUSHED COWED BROKEN IN AND
BROKEN DOWN
ACCORDING TO HER I WAS BORN ONLY TO WORK FOR A PIECE OF
BREAD TO AWAIT THE PAINS OF DEATH AND STEADILY THROUGH ALL LIFE TO
DESPOND
REASON MIGHT BE RIGHT YET NO WONDER WE ARE GLAD AT TIMES TO
DEFY HER TO RUSH FROM UNDER HER ROD AND GIVE A TRUANT HOUR TO
IMAGINATION HER SOFT BRIGHT FOE OUR SWEET HELP OUR DIVINE HOPE
WE SHALL AND MUST BREAK BOUNDS AT INTERVALS DESPITE THE TERRIBLE
REVENGE THAT AWAITS OUR RETURN
REASON IS VINDICTIVE AS A DEVIL FOR ME
SHE WAS ALWAYS ENVENOMED AS A STEP MOTHER
IF I HAVE OBEYED HER IT HAS
CHIEFLY BEEN WITH THE OBEDIENCE OF FEAR NOT OF LOVE
LONG AGO I SHOULD
HAVE DIED OF HER ILL USAGE HER STINT HER CHILL HER BARREN BOARD HER
ICY BED HER SAVAGE CEASELESS BLOWS BUT FOR THAT KINDER POWER WHO
HOLDS MY SECRET AND SWORN ALLEGIANCE
OFTEN HAS REASON TURNED ME OUT BY
NIGHT IN MID WINTER ON COLD SNOW FLINGING FOR SUSTENANCE THE GNAWED
BONE DOGS HAD FORSAKEN STERNLY HAS SHE VOWED HER STORES HELD NOTHING
MORE FOR ME HARSHLY DENIED MY RIGHT TO ASK BETTER THINGS
THEN
LOOKING UP HAVE I SEEN IN THE SKY A HEAD AMIDST CIRCLING STARS OF
WHICH THE MIDMOST AND THE BRIGHTEST LENT A RAY SYMPATHETIC AND ATTENT
A SPIRIT SOFTER AND BETTER THAN HUMAN REASON HAS DESCENDED WITH QUIET
FLIGHT TO THE WASTE BRINGING ALL ROUND HER A SPHERE OF AIR BORROWED OF
ETERNAL SUMMER BRINGING PERFUME OF FLOWERS WHICH CANNOT
FADE FRAGRANCE OF TREES WHOSE FRUIT IS LIFE BRINGING BREEZES PURE
FROM A WORLD WHOSE DAY NEEDS NO SUN TO LIGHTEN IT
MY HUNGER HAS THIS
GOOD ANGEL APPEASED WITH FOOD SWEET AND STRANGE GATHERED AMONGST
GLEANING ANGELS GARNERING THEIR DEW WHITE HARVEST IN THE FIRST FRESH
HOUR OF A HEAVENLY DAY TENDERLY HAS SHE ASSUAGED THE INSUFFERABLE
FEARS WHICH WEEP AWAY LIFE ITSELF KINDLY GIVEN REST TO DEADLY
WEARINESS GENEROUSLY LENT HOPE AND IMPULSE TO PARALYZED DESPAIR
DIVINE COMPASSIONATE SUCCOURABLE INFLUENCE WHEN I BEND THE KNEE TO
OTHER THAN GOD IT SHALL BE AT THY WHITE AND WINGED FEET BEAUTIFUL ON
MOUNTAIN OR ON PLAIN
TEMPLES HAVE BEEN REARED TO THE SUN ALTARS
DEDICATED TO THE MOON
OH GREATER GLORY TO THEE NEITHER HANDS BUILD
NOR LIPS CONSECRATE BUT HEARTS THROUGH AGES ARE FAITHFUL TO THY
WORSHIP
A DWELLING THOU HAST TOO WIDE FOR WALLS TOO HIGH FOR DOME A
TEMPLE WHOSE FLOORS ARE SPACE RITES WHOSE MYSTERIES TRANSPIRE IN
PRESENCE TO THE KINDLING THE HARMONY OF WORLDS
SOVEREIGN COMPLETE THOU HADST FOR ENDURANCE THY GREAT ARMY OF
MARTYRS FOR ACHIEVEMENT THY CHOSEN BAND OF WORTHIES
DEITY
UNQUESTIONED THINE ESSENCE FOILS DECAY
THIS DAUGHTER OF HEAVEN REMEMBERED ME TO NIGHT SHE SAW ME WEEP AND
SHE CAME WITH COMFORT SLEEP SHE SAID
SLEEP SWEETLY I GILD THY
DREAMS
SHE KEPT HER WORD AND WATCHED ME THROUGH A NIGHT'S REST BUT AT DAWN
REASON RELIEVED THE GUARD
I AWOKE WITH A SORT OF START THE RAIN WAS
DASHING AGAINST THE PANES AND THE WIND UTTERING A PEEVISH CRY AT
INTERVALS THE NIGHT LAMP WAS DYING ON THE BLACK CIRCULAR STAND IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE DORMITORY DAY HAD ALREADY BROKEN
HOW I PITY THOSE WHOM
MENTAL PAIN STUNS INSTEAD OF ROUSING THIS MORNING THE PANG OF WAKING
SNATCHED ME OUT OF BED LIKE A HAND WITH A GIANT'S GRIPE
HOW QUICKLY I
DRESSED IN THE COLD OF THE RAW DAWN HOW DEEPLY I DRANK OF THE ICE COLD
WATER IN MY CARAFE THIS WAS ALWAYS MY CORDIAL TO WHICH LIKE OTHER
DRAM DRINKERS I HAD EAGER RECOURSE WHEN UNSETTLED BY CHAGRIN
ERE LONG THE BELL RANG ITS RVEILLE TO THE WHOLE SCHOOL
BEING
DRESSED I DESCENDED ALONE TO THE REFECTORY WHERE THE STOVE WAS LIT
AND THE AIR WAS WARM THROUGH THE REST OF THE HOUSE IT WAS COLD WITH
THE NIPPING SEVERITY OF A CONTINENTAL WINTER THOUGH NOW BUT THE
BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER A NORTH WIND HAD THUS EARLY BROUGHT A WINTRY
BLIGHT OVER EUROPE I REMEMBER THE BLACK STOVES PLEASED ME LITTLE WHEN
I FIRST CAME BUT NOW I BEGAN TO ASSOCIATE WITH THEM A SENSE OF
COMFORT AND LIKED THEM AS IN ENGLAND WE LIKE A FIRESIDE
SITTING DOWN BEFORE THIS DARK COMFORTER I PRESENTLY FELL INTO A DEEP
ARGUMENT WITH MYSELF ON LIFE AND ITS CHANCES ON DESTINY AND HER
DECREES
MY MIND CALMER AND STRONGER NOW THAN LAST NIGHT MADE FOR
ITSELF SOME IMPERIOUS RULES PROHIBITING UNDER DEADLY PENALTIES ALL
WEAK RETROSPECT OF HAPPINESS PAST COMMANDING A PATIENT JOURNEYING
THROUGH THE WILDERNESS OF THE PRESENT ENJOINING A RELIANCE ON FAITH A
WATCHING OF THE CLOUD AND PILLAR WHICH SUBDUE WHILE THEY GUIDE AND AWE
WHILE THEY ILLUMINE HUSHING THE IMPULSE TO FOND IDOLATRY CHECKING THE
LONGING OUT LOOK FOR A FAR OFF PROMISED LAND WHOSE RIVERS ARE PERHAPS
NEVER TO BE REACHED SAVE IN DYING DREAMS WHOSE SWEET PASTURES ARE TO
BE VIEWED BUT FROM THE DESOLATE AND SEPULCHRAL SUMMIT OF A NEBO
BY DEGREES A COMPOSITE FEELING OF BLENDED STRENGTH AND PAIN WOUND
ITSELF WIRILY ROUND MY HEART SUSTAINED OR AT LEAST RESTRAINED ITS
THROBBINGS AND MADE ME FIT FOR THE DAY'S WORK
I LIFTED MY HEAD
AS I SAID BEFORE I WAS SITTING NEAR THE STOVE LET INTO THE WALL
BENEATH THE REFECTORY AND THE CARR AND THUS SUFFICING TO HEAT BOTH
APARTMENTS
PIERCING THE SAME WALL AND CLOSE BESIDE THE STOVE WAS A
WINDOW LOOKING ALSO INTO THE CARR AS I LOOKED UP A CAP TASSEL A
BROW TWO EYES FILLED A PANE OF THAT WINDOW THE FIXED GAZE OF THOSE
TWO EYES HIT RIGHT AGAINST MY OWN GLANCE THEY WERE WATCHING ME
I HAD
NOT TILL THAT MOMENT KNOWN THAT TEARS WERE ON MY CHEEK BUT I FELT THEM
NOW
THIS WAS A STRANGE HOUSE WHERE NO CORNER WAS SACRED FROM INTRUSION
WHERE NOT A TEAR COULD BE SHED NOR A THOUGHT PONDERED BUT A SPY WAS
AT HAND TO NOTE AND TO DIVINE
AND THIS NEW THIS OUT DOOR THIS MALE
SPY WHAT BUSINESS HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE PREMISES AT THIS UNWONTED
HOUR WHAT POSSIBLE RIGHT HAD HE TO INTRUDE ON ME THUS NO OTHER
PROFESSOR WOULD HAVE DARED TO CROSS THE CARR BEFORE THE CLASS BELL
RANG
M
EMANUEL TOOK NO ACCOUNT OF HOURS NOR OF CLAIMS THERE WAS SOME
BOOK OF REFERENCE IN THE FIRST CLASS LIBRARY WHICH HE HAD OCCASION TO
CONSULT HE HAD COME TO SEEK IT ON HIS WAY HE PASSED THE REFECTORY
IT
WAS VERY MUCH HIS HABIT TO WEAR EYES BEFORE BEHIND AND ON EACH SIDE
OF HIM HE HAD SEEN ME THROUGH THE LITTLE WINDOW HE NOW OPENED THE
REFECTORY DOOR AND THERE HE STOOD
MADEMOISELLE VOUS TES TRISTE
MONSIEUR J'EN AI BIEN LE DROIT
VOUS TES MALADE DE COEUR ET D'HUMEUR HE PURSUED
YOU ARE AT ONCE
MOURNFUL AND MUTINOUS
I SEE ON YOUR CHEEK TWO TEARS WHICH I KNOW ARE
HOT AS TWO SPARKS AND SALT AS TWO CRYSTALS OF THE SEA
WHILE I SPEAK
YOU EYE ME STRANGELY
SHALL I TELL YOU OF WHAT I AM REMINDED WHILE
WATCHING YOU
MONSIEUR I SHALL BE CALLED AWAY TO PRAYERS SHORTLY MY TIME FOR
CONVERSATION IS VERY SCANT AND BRIEF AT THIS HOUR EXCUSE
I EXCUSE EVERYTHING HE INTERRUPTED MY MOOD IS SO MEEK NEITHER
REBUFF NOR PERHAPS INSULT COULD RUFFLE IT
YOU REMIND ME THEN OF A
YOUNG SHE WILD CREATURE NEW CAUGHT UNTAMED VIEWING WITH A MIXTURE OF
FIRE AND FEAR THE FIRST ENTRANCE OF THE BREAKER IN
UNWARRANTABLE ACCOST RASH AND RUDE IF ADDRESSED TO A PUPIL TO A
TEACHER INADMISSIBLE
HE THOUGHT TO PROVOKE A WARM REPLY I HAD SEEN
HIM VEX THE PASSIONATE TO EXPLOSION BEFORE NOW
IN ME HIS MALICE SHOULD
FIND NO GRATIFICATION I SAT SILENT
YOU LOOK SAID HE LIKE ONE WHO WOULD SNATCH AT A DRAUGHT OF SWEET
POISON AND SPURN WHOLESOME BITTERS WITH DISGUST
INDEED I NEVER LIKED BITTERS NOR DO I BELIEVE THEM WHOLESOME
AND TO
WHATEVER IS SWEET BE IT POISON OR FOOD YOU CANNOT AT LEAST DENY ITS
OWN DELICIOUS QUALITY SWEETNESS
BETTER PERHAPS TO DIE QUICKLY A
PLEASANT DEATH THAN DRAG ON LONG A CHARMLESS LIFE
YET SAID HE YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR BITTER DOSE DULY AND DAILY IF I
HAD THE POWER TO ADMINISTER IT AND AS TO THE WELL BELOVED POISON I
WOULD PERHAPS BREAK THE VERY CUP WHICH HELD IT
I SHARPLY TURNED MY HEAD AWAY PARTLY BECAUSE HIS PRESENCE UTTERLY
DISPLEASED ME AND PARTLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO SHUN QUESTIONS LEST IN
MY PRESENT MOOD THE EFFORT OF ANSWERING SHOULD OVERMASTER SELF COMMAND
COME SAID HE MORE SOFTLY TELL ME THE TRUTH YOU GRIEVE AT BEING
PARTED FROM FRIENDS IS IT NOT SO
THE INSINUATING SOFTNESS WAS NOT MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN THE INQUISITORIAL
CURIOSITY
I WAS SILENT
HE CAME INTO THE ROOM SAT DOWN ON THE BENCH
ABOUT TWO YARDS FROM ME AND PERSEVERED LONG AND FOR HIM PATIENTLY
IN ATTEMPTS TO DRAW ME INTO CONVERSATION ATTEMPTS NECESSARILY
UNAVAILING BECAUSE I COULD NOT TALK
AT LAST I ENTREATED TO BE LET
ALONE
IN UTTERING THE REQUEST MY VOICE FALTERED MY HEAD SANK ON MY
ARMS AND THE TABLE
I WEPT BITTERLY THOUGH QUIETLY
HE SAT A WHILE
LONGER
I DID NOT LOOK UP NOR SPEAK TILL THE CLOSING DOOR AND HIS
RETREATING STEP TOLD ME THAT HE WAS GONE
THESE TEARS PROVED A RELIEF
I HAD TIME TO BATHE MY EYES BEFORE BREAKFAST AND I SUPPOSE I APPEARED
AT THAT MEAL AS SERENE AS ANY OTHER PERSON NOT HOWEVER QUITE AS
JOCUND LOOKING AS THE YOUNG LADY WHO PLACED HERSELF IN THE SEAT
OPPOSITE MINE FIXED ON ME A PAIR OF SOMEWHAT SMALL EYES TWINKLING
GLEEFULLY AND FRANKLY STRETCHED ACROSS THE TABLE A WHITE HAND TO BE
SHAKEN
MISS FANSHAWE'S TRAVELS GAIETIES AND FLIRTATIONS AGREED WITH
HER MIGHTILY SHE HAD BECOME QUITE PLUMP HER CHEEKS LOOKED AS ROUND AS
APPLES
I HAD SEEN HER LAST IN ELEGANT EVENING ATTIRE
I DON'T KNOW
THAT SHE LOOKED LESS CHARMING NOW IN HER SCHOOL DRESS A KIND OF
CARELESS PEIGNOIR OF A DARK BLUE MATERIAL DIMLY AND DINGILY PLAIDED
WITH BLACK
I EVEN THINK THIS DUSKY WRAPPER GAVE HER CHARMS A TRIUMPH
ENHANCING BY CONTRAST THE FAIRNESS OF HER SKIN THE FRESHNESS OF HER
BLOOM THE GOLDEN BEAUTY OF HER TRESSES
I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME BACK TIMON SAID SHE
TIMON WAS ONE OF HER
DOZEN NAMES FOR ME
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN I HAVE WANTED YOU IN THIS
DISMAL HOLE
OH HAVE YOU THEN OF COURSE IF YOU WANTED ME YOU HAVE SOMETHING
FOR ME TO DO STOCKINGS TO MEND PERHAPS I NEVER GAVE GINEVRA A
MINUTE'S OR A FARTHING'S CREDIT FOR DISINTERESTEDNESS
CRABBED AND CRUSTY AS EVER SAID SHE
I EXPECTED AS MUCH IT WOULD
NOT BE YOU IF YOU DID NOT SNUB ONE
BUT NOW COME GRAND MOTHER I HOPE
YOU LIKE COFFEE AS MUCH AND PISTOLETS AS LITTLE AS EVER ARE YOU
DISPOSED TO BARTER
TAKE YOUR OWN WAY
THIS WAY CONSISTED IN A HABIT SHE HAD OF MAKING ME CONVENIENT
SHE DID
NOT LIKE THE MORNING CUP OF COFFEE ITS SCHOOL BREWAGE NOT BEING STRONG
OR SWEET ENOUGH TO SUIT HER PALATE AND SHE HAD AN EXCELLENT APPETITE
LIKE ANY OTHER HEALTHY SCHOOL GIRL FOR THE MORNING PISTOLETS OR ROLLS
WHICH WERE NEW BAKED AND VERY GOOD AND OF WHICH A CERTAIN ALLOWANCE
WAS SERVED TO EACH
THIS ALLOWANCE BEING MORE THAN I NEEDED I GAVE
HALF TO GINEVRA NEVER VARYING IN MY PREFERENCE THOUGH MANY OTHERS
USED TO COVET THE SUPERFLUITY AND SHE IN RETURN WOULD SOMETIMES GIVE
ME A PORTION OF HER COFFEE
THIS MORNING I WAS GLAD OF THE DRAUGHT
HUNGER I HAD NONE AND WITH THIRST I WAS PARCHED
I DON'T KNOW WHY I
CHOSE TO GIVE MY BREAD RATHER TO GINEVRA THAN TO ANOTHER NOR WHY IF
TWO HAD TO SHARE THE CONVENIENCE OF ONE DRINKING VESSEL AS SOMETIMES
HAPPENED FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE TOOK A LONG WALK INTO THE COUNTRY AND
HALTED FOR REFRESHMENT AT A FARM I ALWAYS CONTRIVED THAT SHE SHOULD BE
MY CONVIVE AND RATHER LIKED TO LET HER TAKE THE LION'S SHARE WHETHER
OF THE WHITE BEER THE SWEET WINE OR THE NEW MILK SO IT WAS HOWEVER
AND SHE KNEW IT AND THEREFORE WHILE WE WRANGLED DAILY WE WERE NEVER
ALIENATED
AFTER BREAKFAST MY CUSTOM WAS TO WITHDRAW TO THE FIRST CLASSE AND SIT
AND READ OR THINK OFTENEST THE LATTER THERE ALONE TILL THE
NINE O'CLOCK BELL THREW OPEN ALL DOORS ADMITTED THE GATHERED RUSH OF
EXTERNES AND DEMI PENSIONNAIRES AND GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR ENTRANCE ON
THAT BUSTLE AND BUSINESS TO WHICH TILL FIVE P M THERE WAS NO RELAX
I WAS JUST SEATED THIS MORNING WHEN A TAP CAME TO THE DOOR
PARDON MADEMOISELLE SAID A PENSIONNAIRE ENTERING GENTLY AND
HAVING TAKEN FROM HER DESK SOME NECESSARY BOOK OR PAPER SHE WITHDREW
ON TIP TOE MURMURING AS SHE PASSED ME QUE MADEMOISELLE EST
APPLIQUE
APPLIQUE INDEED THE MEANS OF APPLICATION WERE SPREAD BEFORE ME BUT
I WAS DOING NOTHING AND HAD DONE NOTHING AND MEANT TO DO NOTHING
THUS DOES THE WORLD GIVE US CREDIT FOR MERITS WE HAVE NOT
MADAME BECK
HERSELF DEEMED ME A REGULAR BAS BLEU AND OFTEN AND SOLEMNLY USED TO
WARN ME NOT TO STUDY TOO MUCH LEST THE BLOOD SHOULD ALL GO TO MY
HEAD INDEED EVERYBODY IN THE RUE FOSSETTE HELD A SUPERSTITION THAT
MEESS LUCIE WAS LEARNED WITH THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION OF M
EMANUEL
WHO BY MEANS PECULIAR TO HIMSELF AND QUITE INSCRUTABLE TO ME HAD
OBTAINED A NOT INACCURATE INKLING OF MY REAL QUALIFICATIONS AND USED
TO TAKE QUIET OPPORTUNITIES OF CHUCKLING IN MY EAR HIS MALIGN GLEE OVER
THEIR SCANT MEASURE
FOR MY PART I NEVER TROUBLED MYSELF ABOUT THIS
PENURY
I DEARLY LIKE TO THINK MY OWN THOUGHTS I HAD GREAT PLEASURE IN
READING A FEW BOOKS BUT NOT MANY PREFERRING ALWAYS THOSE ON WHOSE
STYLE OR SENTIMENT THE WRITER'S INDIVIDUAL NATURE WAS PLAINLY STAMPED
FLAGGING INEVITABLY OVER CHARACTERLESS BOOKS HOWEVER CLEVER AND
MERITORIOUS PERCEIVING WELL THAT AS FAR AS MY OWN MIND WAS CONCERNED
GOD HAD LIMITED ITS POWERS AND ITS ACTION THANKFUL I TRUST FOR THE
GIFT BESTOWED BUT UNAMBITIOUS OF HIGHER ENDOWMENTS NOT RESTLESSLY
EAGER AFTER HIGHER CULTURE
THE POLITE PUPIL WAS SCARCELY GONE WHEN UNCEREMONIOUSLY WITHOUT TAP
IN BURST A SECOND INTRUDER
HAD I BEEN BLIND I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHO
THIS WAS
A CONSTITUTIONAL RESERVE OF MANNER HAD BY THIS TIME TOLD WITH
WHOLESOME AND FOR ME COMMODIOUS EFFECT ON THE MANNERS OF MY
CO INMATES RARELY DID I NOW SUFFER FROM RUDE OR INTRUSIVE TREATMENT
WHEN I FIRST CAME IT WOULD HAPPEN ONCE AND AGAIN THAT A BLUNT GERMAN
WOULD CLAP ME ON THE SHOULDER AND ASK ME TO RUN A RACE OR A RIOTOUS
LABASSECOURIENNE SEIZE ME BY THE ARM AND DRAG ME TOWARDS THE
PLAYGROUND URGENT PROPOSALS TO TAKE A SWING AT THE PAS DE GANT OR
TO JOIN IN A CERTAIN ROMPING HIDE AND SEEK GAME CALLED UN DEUX
TROIS WERE FORMERLY ALSO OF HOURLY OCCURRENCE BUT ALL THESE LITTLE
ATTENTIONS HAD CEASED SOME TIME AGO CEASED TOO WITHOUT MY FINDING IT
NECESSARY TO BE AT THE TROUBLE OF POINT BLANK CUTTING THEM SHORT
I HAD
NOW NO FAMILIAR DEMONSTRATION TO DREAD OR ENDURE SAVE FROM ONE
QUARTER AND AS THAT WAS ENGLISH I COULD BEAR IT
GINEVRA FANSHAWE MADE
NO SCRUPLE OF AT TIMES CATCHING ME AS I WAS CROSSING THE CARR
WHIRLING ME ROUND IN A COMPULSORY WALTZ AND HEARTILY ENJOYING THE
MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DISCOMFITURE HER PROCEEDING INDUCED
GINEVRA
FANSHAWE IT WAS WHO NOW BROKE IN UPON MY LEARNED LEISURE SHE CARRIED
A HUGE MUSIC BOOK UNDER HER ARM
GO TO YOUR PRACTISING SAID I TO HER AT ONCE AWAY WITH YOU TO THE
LITTLE SALON
NOT TILL I HAVE HAD A TALK WITH YOU CHRE AMIE
I KNOW WHERE YOU HAVE
BEEN SPENDING YOUR VACATION AND HOW YOU HAVE COMMENCED SACRIFICING TO
THE GRACES AND ENJOYING LIFE LIKE ANY OTHER BELLE
I SAW YOU AT THE
CONCERT THE OTHER NIGHT DRESSED ACTUALLY LIKE ANYBODY ELSE

YOUR TAILLEUSE
TITTLE TATTLE HOW PRETTILY IT BEGINS MY TAILLEUSE A FIDDLESTICK
COME SHEER OFF GINEVRA
I REALLY DON'T WANT YOUR COMPANY
BUT WHEN I WANT YOURS SO MUCH ANGE FAROUCHE WHAT DOES A LITTLE
RELUCTANCE ON YOUR PART SIGNIFY DIEU MERCI WE KNOW HOW TO MANOEUVRE
WITH OUR GIFTED COMPATRIOTE THE LEARNED 'OURSE BRITANNIQUE AND SO
OURSON YOU KNOW ISIDORE
I KNOW JOHN BRETTON
OH HUSH PUTTING HER FINGERS IN HER EARS YOU CRACK MY TYMPANUMS
WITH YOUR RUDE ANGLICISMS
BUT HOW IS OUR WELL BELOVED JOHN DO TELL
ME ABOUT HIM
THE POOR MAN MUST BE IN A SAD WAY
WHAT DID HE SAY TO MY
BEHAVIOUR THE OTHER NIGHT WASN'T I CRUEL
DO YOU THINK I NOTICED YOU
IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL EVENING
OH THAT DIVINE DE HAMAL AND THEN TO
WATCH THE OTHER SULKING AND DYING IN THE DISTANCE AND THE OLD LADY MY
FUTURE MAMMA IN LAW BUT I AM AFRAID I AND LADY SARA WERE A LITTLE RUDE
IN QUIZZING HER
LADY SARA NEVER QUIZZED HER AT ALL AND FOR WHAT YOU DID DON'T MAKE
YOURSELF IN THE LEAST UNEASY MRS
BRETTON WILL SURVIVE YOUR SNEER
SHE MAY OLD LADIES ARE TOUGH BUT THAT POOR SON OF HERS DO TELL ME
WHAT HE SAID I SAW HE WAS TERRIBLY CUT UP
HE SAID YOU LOOKED AS IF AT HEART YOU WERE ALREADY MADAME DE HAMAL
DID HE SHE CRIED WITH DELIGHT
HE NOTICED THAT HOW CHARMING I
THOUGHT HE WOULD BE MAD WITH JEALOUSY
GINEVRA HAVE YOU SERIOUSLY DONE WITH DR
BRETTON DO YOU WANT HIM TO
GIVE YOU UP
OH YOU KNOW HE CAN'T DO THAT BUT WASN'T HE MAD
QUITE MAD I ASSENTED AS MAD AS A MARCH HARE
WELL AND HOW EVER DID YOU GET HIM HOME
HOW EVER INDEED HAVE YOU NO PITY ON HIS POOR MOTHER AND ME FANCY
US HOLDING HIM TIGHT DOWN IN THE CARRIAGE AND HE RAVING BETWEEN US
FIT TO DRIVE EVERYBODY DELIRIOUS
THE VERY COACHMAN WENT WRONG
SOMEHOW AND WE LOST OUR WAY
YOU DON'T SAY SO YOU ARE LAUGHING AT ME
NOW LUCY SNOWE
I ASSURE YOU IT IS FACT AND FACT ALSO THAT DR
BRETTON WOULD NOT
STAY IN THE CARRIAGE HE BROKE FROM US AND WOULD RIDE OUTSIDE
AND AFTERWARDS
AFTERWARDS WHEN HE DID REACH HOME THE SCENE TRANSCENDS
DESCRIPTION
OH BUT DESCRIBE IT YOU KNOW IT IS SUCH FUN
FUN FOR YOU MISS FANSHAWE BUT WITH STERN GRAVITY YOU KNOW THE
PROVERB 'WHAT IS SPORT TO ONE MAY BE DEATH TO ANOTHER
GO ON THERE'S A DARLING TIMON
CONSCIENTIOUSLY I CANNOT UNLESS YOU ASSURE ME YOU HAVE SOME HEART
I HAVE SUCH AN IMMENSITY YOU DON'T KNOW
GOOD IN THAT CASE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE DR
GRAHAM BRETTON
REJECTING HIS SUPPER IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE CHICKEN THE SWEETBREAD
PREPARED FOR HIS REFRESHMENT LEFT ON THE TABLE UNTOUCHED
THEN BUT
IT IS OF NO USE DWELLING AT LENGTH ON THE HARROWING DETAILS
SUFFICE IT
TO SAY THAT NEVER IN THE MOST STORMY FITS AND MOMENTS OF HIS INFANCY
HAD HIS MOTHER SUCH WORK TO TUCK THE SHEETS ABOUT HIM AS SHE HAD THAT
NIGHT
HE WOULDN'T LIE STILL
HE WOULDN'T LIE STILL THERE IT WAS
THE SHEETS MIGHT BE TUCKED IN
BUT THE THING WAS TO KEEP THEM TUCKED IN
AND WHAT DID HE SAY
SAY CAN'T YOU IMAGINE HIM DEMANDING HIS DIVINE GINEVRA
ANATHEMATIZING THAT DEMON DE HAMAL RAVING ABOUT GOLDEN LOCKS BLUE
EYES WHITE ARMS GLITTERING BRACELETS
NO DID HE HE SAW THE BRACELET
SAW THE BRACELET YES AS PLAIN AS I SAW IT AND PERHAPS FOR THE
FIRST TIME HE SAW ALSO THE BRAND MARK WITH WHICH ITS PRESSURE HAS
ENCIRCLED YOUR ARM
GINEVRA RISING AND CHANGING MY TONE COME WE
WILL HAVE AN END OF THIS
GO AWAY TO YOUR PRACTISING
AND I OPENED THE DOOR
BUT YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME ALL
YOU HAD BETTER NOT WAIT UNTIL I DO TELL YOU ALL
SUCH EXTRA
COMMUNICATIVENESS COULD GIVE YOU NO PLEASURE
MARCH
CROSS THING SAID SHE BUT SHE OBEYED AND INDEED THE FIRST CLASSE
WAS MY TERRITORY AND SHE COULD NOT THERE LEGALLY RESIST A NOTICE OF
QUITTANCE FROM ME
YET TO SPEAK THE TRUTH NEVER HAD I BEEN LESS DISSATISFIED WITH HER
THAN I WAS THEN
THERE WAS PLEASURE IN THINKING OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN
THE REALITY AND MY DESCRIPTION TO REMEMBER DR
JOHN ENJOYING THE DRIVE
HOME EATING HIS SUPPER WITH RELISH AND RETIRING TO REST WITH
CHRISTIAN COMPOSURE
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I SAW HIM REALLY UNHAPPY THAT I
FELT REALLY VEXED WITH THE FAIR FRAIL CAUSE OF HIS SUFFERING
A FORTNIGHT PASSED I WAS GETTING ONCE MORE INURED TO THE HARNESS OF
SCHOOL AND LAPSING FROM THE PASSIONATE PAIN OF CHANGE TO THE PALSY OF
CUSTOM
ONE AFTERNOON IN CROSSING THE CARR ON MY WAY TO THE FIRST
CLASSE WHERE I WAS EXPECTED TO ASSIST AT A LESSON OF STYLE AND
LITERATURE I SAW STANDING BY ONE OF THE LONG AND LARGE WINDOWS
ROSINE THE PORTRESS
HER ATTITUDE AS USUAL WAS QUITE NONCHALANTE
SHE ALWAYS STOOD AT EASE ONE OF HER HANDS RESTED IN HER
APRON POCKET THE OTHER AT THIS MOMENT HELD TO HER EYES A LETTER
WHEREOF MADEMOISELLE COOLLY PERUSED THE ADDRESS AND DELIBERATELY
STUDIED THE SEAL
A LETTER THE SHAPE OF A LETTER SIMILAR TO THAT HAD HAUNTED MY BRAIN IN
ITS VERY CORE FOR SEVEN DAYS PAST
I HAD DREAMED OF A LETTER LAST
NIGHT
STRONG MAGNETISM DREW ME TO THAT LETTER NOW YET WHETHER I
SHOULD HAVE VENTURED TO DEMAND OF ROSINE SO MUCH AS A GLANCE AT THAT
WHITE ENVELOPE WITH THE SPOT OF RED WAX IN THE MIDDLE I KNOW NOT
NO
I THINK I SHOULD HAVE SNEAKED PAST IN TERROR OF A REBUFF FROM
DISAPPOINTMENT MY HEART THROBBED NOW AS IF I ALREADY HEARD THE TRAMP
OF HER APPROACH
NERVOUS MISTAKE IT WAS THE RAPID STEP OF THE
PROFESSOR OF LITERATURE MEASURING THE CORRIDOR
I FLED BEFORE HIM
COULD I BUT BE SEATED QUIETLY AT MY DESK BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL WITH THE
CLASS UNDER MY ORDERS ALL IN DISCIPLINED READINESS HE WOULD PERHAPS
EXEMPT ME FROM NOTICE BUT IF CAUGHT LINGERING IN THE CARR I SHOULD
BE SURE TO COME IN FOR A SPECIAL HARANGUE
I HAD TIME TO GET SEATED TO
ENFORCE PERFECT SILENCE TO TAKE OUT MY WORK AND TO COMMENCE IT AMIDST
THE PROFOUNDEST AND BEST TRAINED HUSH ERE M
EMANUEL ENTERED WITH HIS
VEHEMENT BURST OF LATCH AND PANEL AND HIS DEEP REDUNDANT BOW
PROPHETIC OF CHOLER
AS USUAL HE BROKE UPON US LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER BUT INSTEAD OF
FLASHING LIGHTNING WISE FROM THE DOOR TO THE ESTRADE HIS CAREER HALTED
MIDWAY AT MY DESK
SETTING HIS FACE TOWARDS ME AND THE WINDOW HIS BACK
TO THE PUPILS AND THE ROOM HE GAVE ME A LOOK SUCH A LOOK AS MIGHT
HAVE LICENSED ME TO STAND STRAIGHT UP AND DEMAND WHAT HE MEANT A LOOK
OF SCOWLING DISTRUST
VOIL POUR VOUS SAID HE DRAWING HIS HAND FROM HIS WAIST COAT AND
PLACING ON MY DESK A LETTER THE VERY LETTER I HAD SEEN IN ROSINE'S
HAND THE LETTER WHOSE FACE OF ENAMELLED WHITE AND SINGLE CYCLOP'S EYE
OF VERMILION RED HAD PRINTED THEMSELVES SO CLEAR AND PERFECT ON THE
RETINA OF AN INWARD VISION
I KNEW IT I FELT IT TO BE THE LETTER OF MY
HOPE THE FRUITION OF MY WISH THE RELEASE FROM MY DOUBT THE RANSOM
FROM MY TERROR
THIS LETTER M
PAUL WITH HIS UNWARRANTABLY INTERFERING
HABITS HAD TAKEN FROM THE PORTRESS AND NOW DELIVERED IT HIMSELF
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANGRY BUT HAD NOT A SECOND FOR THE SENSATION
YES I
HELD IN MY HAND NOT A SLIGHT NOTE BUT AN ENVELOPE WHICH MUST AT
LEAST CONTAIN A SHEET IT FELT NOT FLIMSY BUT FIRM SUBSTANTIAL
SATISFYING
AND HERE WAS THE DIRECTION MISS LUCY SNOWE IN A CLEAN
CLEAR EQUAL DECIDED HAND AND HERE WAS THE SEAL ROUND FULL DEFTLY
DROPPED BY UNTREMULOUS FINGERS STAMPED WITH THE WELL CUT IMPRESS OF
INITIALS J
G
B I EXPERIENCED A HAPPY FEELING A GLAD EMOTION
WHICH WENT WARM TO MY HEART AND RAN LIVELY THROUGH ALL MY VEINS
FOR
ONCE A HOPE WAS REALIZED
I HELD IN MY HAND A MORSEL OF REAL SOLID JOY
NOT A DREAM NOT AN IMAGE OF THE BRAIN NOT ONE OF THOSE SHADOWY
CHANCES IMAGINATION PICTURES AND ON WHICH HUMANITY STARVES BUT CANNOT
LIVE NOT A MESS OF THAT MANNA I DREARILY EULOGIZED AWHILE AGO WHICH
INDEED AT FIRST MELTS ON THE LIPS WITH AN UNSPEAKABLE AND
PRETERNATURAL SWEETNESS BUT WHICH IN THE END OUR SOULS FULL SURELY
LOATHE LONGING DELIRIOUSLY FOR NATURAL AND EARTH GROWN FOOD WILDLY
PRAYING HEAVEN'S SPIRITS TO RECLAIM THEIR OWN SPIRIT DEW AND
ESSENCE AN ALIMENT DIVINE BUT FOR MORTALS DEADLY
IT WAS NEITHER
SWEET HAIL NOR SMALL CORIANDER SEED NEITHER SLIGHT WAFER NOR LUSCIOUS
HONEY I HAD LIGHTED ON IT WAS THE WILD SAVOURY MESS OF THE HUNTER
NOURISHING AND SALUBRIOUS MEAT FOREST FED OR DESERT REARED FRESH
HEALTHFUL AND LIFE SUSTAINING
IT WAS WHAT THE OLD DYING PATRIARCH
DEMANDED OF HIS SON ESAU PROMISING IN REQUITAL THE BLESSING OF HIS
LAST BREATH
IT WAS A GODSEND AND I INWARDLY THANKED THE GOD WHO HAD
VOUCHSAFED IT
OUTWARDLY I ONLY THANKED MAN CRYING THANK YOU THANK
YOU MONSIEUR
MONSIEUR CURLED HIS LIP GAVE ME A VICIOUS GLANCE OF THE EYE AND
STRODE TO HIS ESTRADE
M
PAUL WAS NOT AT ALL A GOOD LITTLE MAN THOUGH
HE HAD GOOD POINTS
DID I READ MY LETTER THERE AND THEN DID I CONSUME THE VENISON AT ONCE
AND WITH HASTE AS IF ESAU'S SHAFT FLEW EVERY DAY
I KNEW BETTER
THE COVER WITH ITS ADDRESS THE SEAL WITH ITS THREE
CLEAR LETTERS WAS BOUNTY AND ABUNDANCE FOR THE PRESENT
I STOLE FROM
THE ROOM I PROCURED THE KEY OF THE GREAT DORMITORY WHICH WAS KEPT
LOCKED BY DAY
I WENT TO MY BUREAU WITH A SORT OF HASTE AND TREMBLING
LEST MADAME SHOULD CREEP UP STAIRS AND SPY ME I OPENED A DRAWER
UNLOCKED A BOX AND TOOK OUT A CASE AND HAVING FEASTED MY EYES WITH
ONE MORE LOOK AND APPROACHED THE SEAL WITH A MIXTURE OF AWE AND SHAME
AND DELIGHT TO MY LIPS I FOLDED THE UNTASTED TREASURE YET ALL FAIR
AND INVIOLATE IN SILVER PAPER COMMITTED IT TO THE CASE SHUT UP BOX
AND DRAWER RECLOSED RELOCKED THE DORMITORY AND RETURNED TO CLASS
FEELING AS IF FAIRY TALES WERE TRUE AND FAIRY GIFTS NO DREAM
STRANGE
SWEET INSANITY AND THIS LETTER THE SOURCE OF MY JOY I HAD NOT YET
READ DID NOT YET KNOW THE NUMBER OF ITS LINES
WHEN I RE ENTERED THE SCHOOLROOM BEHOLD M
PAUL RAGING LIKE A
PESTILENCE SOME PUPIL HAD NOT SPOKEN AUDIBLY OR DISTINCTLY ENOUGH TO
SUIT HIS EAR AND TASTE AND NOW SHE AND OTHERS WERE WEEPING AND HE WAS
RAVING FROM HIS ESTRADE ALMOST LIVID
CURIOUS TO MENTION AS I
APPEARED HE FELL ON ME
WAS I THE MISTRESS OF THESE GIRLS DID I PROFESS TO TEACH THEM THE
CONDUCT BEFITTING LADIES AND DID I PERMIT AND HE DOUBTED NOT
ENCOURAGE THEM TO STRANGLE THEIR MOTHER TONGUE IN THEIR THROATS TO
MINCE AND MASH IT BETWEEN THEIR TEETH AS IF THEY HAD SOME BASE CAUSE
TO BE ASHAMED OF THE WORDS THEY UTTERED WAS THIS MODESTY HE KNEW
BETTER
IT WAS A VILE PSEUDO SENTIMENT THE OFFSPRING OR THE FORERUNNER
OF EVIL
RATHER THAN SUBMIT TO THIS MOPPING AND MOWING THIS MINCING
AND GRIMACING THIS GRINDING OF A NOBLE TONGUE THIS GENERAL
AFFECTATION AND SICKENING STUBBORNNESS OF THE PUPILS OF THE FIRST
CLASS HE WOULD THROW THEM UP FOR A SET OF INSUPPORTABLE PETITES
MATRESSES AND CONFINE HIMSELF TO TEACHING THE ABC TO THE BABIES OF
THE THIRD DIVISION
WHAT COULD I SAY TO ALL THIS REALLY NOTHING AND I HOPED HE WOULD
ALLOW ME TO BE SILENT
THE STORM RECOMMENCED
EVERY ANSWER TO HIS QUERIES WAS THEN REFUSED IT SEEMED TO BE
CONSIDERED IN THAT PLACE THAT CONCEITED BOUDOIR OF A FIRST CLASSE
WITH ITS PRETENTIOUS BOOK CASES ITS GREEN BAIZED DESKS ITS RUBBISH OF
FLOWER STANDS ITS TRASH OF FRAMED PICTURES AND MAPS AND ITS FOREIGN
SURVEILLANTE FORSOOTH IT SEEMED TO BE THE FASHION TO THINK THERE
THAT THE PROFESSOR OF LITERATURE WAS NOT WORTHY OF A REPLY THESE WERE
NEW IDEAS IMPORTED HE DID NOT DOUBT STRAIGHT FROM 'LA GRANDE
BRETAGNE THEY SAVOURED OF ISLAND INSOLENCE AND ARROGANCE
LULL THE SECOND THE GIRLS NOT ONE OF WHOM WAS EVER KNOWN TO WEEP A
TEAR FOR THE REBUKES OF ANY OTHER MASTER NOW ALL MELTING LIKE
SNOW STATUES BEFORE THE INTEMPERATE HEAT OF M
EMANUEL I NOT YET MUCH
SHAKEN SITTING DOWN AND VENTURING TO RESUME MY WORK
SOMETHING EITHER IN MY CONTINUED SILENCE OR IN THE MOVEMENT OF MY
HAND STITCHING TRANSPORTED M
EMANUEL BEYOND THE LAST BOUNDARY OF
PATIENCE HE ACTUALLY SPRANG FROM HIS ESTRADE
THE STOVE STOOD NEAR MY
DESK HE ATTACKED IT THE LITTLE IRON DOOR WAS NEARLY DASHED FROM ITS
HINGES THE FUEL WAS MADE TO FLY
EST CE QUE VOUS AVEZ L'INTENTION DE M'INSULTER SAID HE TO ME IN A
LOW FURIOUS VOICE AS HE THUS OUTRAGED UNDER PRETENCE OF ARRANGING
THE FIRE
IT WAS TIME TO SOOTHE HIM A LITTLE IF POSSIBLE
MAIS MONSIEUR SAID I I WOULD NOT INSULT YOU FOR THE WORLD
I
REMEMBER TOO WELL THAT YOU ONCE SAID WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS
I DID NOT INTEND MY VOICE TO FALTER BUT IT DID MORE I THINK THROUGH
THE AGITATION OF LATE DELIGHT THAN IN ANY SPASM OF PRESENT FEAR
STILL
THERE CERTAINLY WAS SOMETHING IN M
PAUL'S ANGER A KIND OF PASSION OF
EMOTION THAT SPECIALLY TENDED TO DRAW TEARS
I WAS NOT UNHAPPY NOR
MUCH AFRAID YET I WEPT
ALLONS ALLONS SAID HE PRESENTLY LOOKING ROUND AND SEEING THE
DELUGE UNIVERSAL
DECIDEDLY I AM A MONSTER AND A RUFFIAN
I HAVE ONLY
ONE POCKET HANDKERCHIEF HE ADDED BUT IF I HAD TWENTY I WOULD OFFER
YOU EACH ONE
YOUR TEACHER SHALL BE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE
HERE MISS
LUCY
AND HE TOOK FORTH AND HELD OUT TO ME A CLEAN SILK HANDKERCHIEF
NOW A
PERSON WHO DID NOT KNOW M
PAUL WHO WAS UNUSED TO HIM AND HIS
IMPULSES WOULD NATURALLY HAVE BUNGLED AT THIS OFFER DECLINED
ACCEPTING THE SAME ET CETERA
BUT I TOO PLAINLY FELT THIS WOULD NEVER
DO THE SLIGHTEST HESITATION WOULD HAVE BEEN FATAL TO THE INCIPIENT
TREATY OF PEACE
I ROSE AND MET THE HANDKERCHIEF HALF WAY RECEIVED IT
WITH DECORUM WIPED THEREWITH MY EYES AND RESUMING MY SEAT AND
RETAINING THE FLAG OF TRUCE IN MY HAND AND ON MY LAP TOOK ESPECIAL
CARE DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE LESSON TO TOUCH NEITHER NEEDLE NOR
THIMBLE SCISSORS NOR MUSLIN
MANY A JEALOUS GLANCE DID M
PAUL CAST AT
THESE IMPLEMENTS HE HATED THEM MORTALLY CONSIDERING SEWING A SOURCE
OF DISTRACTION FROM THE ATTENTION DUE TO HIMSELF
A VERY ELOQUENT
LESSON HE GAVE AND VERY KIND AND FRIENDLY WAS HE TO THE CLOSE
ERE HE
HAD DONE THE CLOUDS WERE DISPERSED AND THE SUN SHINING OUT TEARS WERE
EXCHANGED FOR SMILES
IN QUITTING THE ROOM HE PAUSED ONCE MORE AT MY DESK
AND YOUR LETTER SAID HE THIS TIME NOT QUITE FIERCELY
I HAVE NOT YET READ IT MONSIEUR
AH IT IS TOO GOOD TO READ AT ONCE YOU SAVE IT AS WHEN I WAS A BOY
I USED TO SAVE A PEACH WHOSE BLOOM WAS VERY RIPE
THE GUESS CAME SO NEAR THE TRUTH I COULD NOT PREVENT A SUDDENLY RISING
WARMTH IN MY FACE FROM REVEALING AS MUCH
YOU PROMISE YOURSELF A PLEASANT MOMENT SAID HE IN READING THAT
LETTER YOU WILL OPEN IT WHEN ALONE N'EST CE PAS AH A SMILE ANSWERS
WELL WELL ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO HARSH 'LA JEUNESSE N'A QU'UN TEMPS
MONSIEUR MONSIEUR I CRIED OR RATHER WHISPERED AFTER HIM AS HE
TURNED TO GO DO NOT LEAVE ME UNDER A MISTAKE
THIS IS MERELY A
FRIEND'S LETTER
WITHOUT READING IT I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT
JE CONOIS JE CONOIS ON SAIT CE QUE C'EST QU'UN AMI
BONJOUR
MADEMOISELLE
BUT MONSIEUR HERE IS YOUR HANDKERCHIEF
KEEP IT KEEP IT TILL THE LETTER IS READ THEN BRING IT ME I SHALL
READ THE BILLET'S TENOR IN YOUR EYES
WHEN HE WAS GONE THE PUPILS HAVING ALREADY POURED OUT OF THE
SCHOOLROOM INTO THE BERCEAU AND THENCE INTO THE GARDEN AND COURT TO
TAKE THEIR CUSTOMARY RECREATION BEFORE THE FIVE O'CLOCK DINNER I STOOD
A MOMENT THINKING AND ABSENTLY TWISTING THE HANDKERCHIEF ROUND MY ARM
FOR SOME REASON GLADDENED I THINK BY A SUDDEN RETURN OF THE GOLDEN
GLIMMER OF CHILDHOOD ROUSED BY AN UNWONTED RENEWAL OF ITS BUOYANCY
MADE MERRY BY THE LIBERTY OF THE CLOSING HOUR AND ABOVE ALL SOLACED
AT HEART BY THE JOYOUS CONSCIOUSNESS OF THAT TREASURE IN THE CASE BOX
DRAWER UP STAIRS I FELL TO PLAYING WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF AS IF IT
WERE A BALL CASTING IT INTO THE AIR AND CATCHING IT AS IT FELL
THE
GAME WAS STOPPED BY ANOTHER HAND THAN MINE A HAND EMERGING FROM A
PALETT SLEEVE AND STRETCHED OVER MY SHOULDER IT CAUGHT THE
EXTEMPORISED PLAYTHING AND BORE IT AWAY WITH THESE SULLEN WORDS
JE VOIS BIEN QUE VOUS VOUS MOQUEZ DE MOI ET DE MES EFFETS
REALLY THAT LITTLE MAN WAS DREADFUL A MERE SPRITE OF CAPRICE AND
UBIQUITY ONE NEVER KNEW EITHER HIS WHIM OR HIS WHEREABOUT
CHAPTER XXII
THE LETTER
WHEN ALL WAS STILL IN THE HOUSE WHEN DINNER WAS OVER AND THE NOISY
RECREATION HOUR PAST WHEN DARKNESS HAD SET IN AND THE QUIET LAMP OF
STUDY WAS LIT IN THE REFECTORY WHEN THE EXTERNES WERE GONE HOME THE
CLASHING DOOR AND CLAMOROUS BELL HUSHED FOR THE EVENING WHEN MADAME
WAS SAFELY SETTLED IN THE SALLE MANGER IN COMPANY WITH HER MOTHER AND
SOME FRIENDS I THEN GLIDED TO THE KITCHEN BEGGED A BOUGIE FOR ONE
HALF HOUR FOR A PARTICULAR OCCASION FOUND ACCEPTANCE OF MY PETITION AT
THE HANDS OF MY FRIEND GOTON WHO ANSWERED MAIS CERTAINEMENT
CHOU CHOU VOUS EN AUREZ DEUX SI VOUS VOULEZ AND LIGHT IN HAND I
MOUNTED NOISELESS TO THE DORMITORY
GREAT WAS MY CHAGRIN TO FIND IN THAT APARTMENT A PUPIL GONE TO BED
INDISPOSED GREATER WHEN I RECOGNISED AMID THE MUSLIN NIGHTCAP
BORDERS THE FIGURE CHIFFONNE OF MISTRESS GINEVRA FANSHAWE SUPINE
AT THIS MOMENT IT IS TRUE BUT CERTAIN TO WAKE AND OVERWHELM ME WITH
CHATTER WHEN THE INTERRUPTION WOULD BE LEAST ACCEPTABLE INDEED AS I
WATCHED HER A SLIGHT TWINKLING OF THE EYELIDS WARNED ME THAT THE
PRESENT APPEARANCE OF REPOSE MIGHT BE BUT A RUSE ASSUMED TO COVER SLY
VIGILANCE OVER TIMON'S MOVEMENTS SHE WAS NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AND I
HAD SO WISHED TO BE ALONE JUST TO READ MY PRECIOUS LETTER IN PEACE
WELL I MUST GO TO THE CLASSES
HAVING SOUGHT AND FOUND MY PRIZE IN ITS
CASKET I DESCENDED
ILL LUCK PURSUED ME
THE CLASSES WERE UNDERGOING
SWEEPING AND PURIFICATION BY CANDLE LIGHT ACCORDING TO HEBDOMADAL
CUSTOM BENCHES WERE PILED ON DESKS THE AIR WAS DIM WITH DUST DAMP
COFFEE GROUNDS USED BY LABASSECOURIEN HOUSEMAIDS INSTEAD OF
TEA LEAVES DARKENED THE FLOOR ALL WAS HOPELESS CONFUSION
BAFFLED
BUT NOT BEATEN I WITHDREW BENT AS RESOLUTELY AS EVER ON FINDING
SOLITUDE SOMEWHERE
TAKING A KEY WHEREOF I KNEW THE REPOSITORY I MOUNTED THREE STAIRCASES
IN SUCCESSION REACHED A DARK NARROW SILENT LANDING OPENED A
WORM EATEN DOOR AND DIVED INTO THE DEEP BLACK COLD GARRET
HERE NONE
WOULD FOLLOW ME NONE INTERRUPT NOT MADAME HERSELF
I SHUT THE
GARRET DOOR I PLACED MY LIGHT ON A DODDERED AND MOULDY CHEST OF
DRAWERS I PUT ON A SHAWL FOR THE AIR WAS ICE COLD I TOOK MY LETTER
TREMBLING WITH SWEET IMPATIENCE I BROKE ITS SEAL
WILL IT BE LONG WILL IT BE SHORT THOUGHT I PASSING MY HAND ACROSS
MY EYES TO DISSIPATE THE SILVERY DIMNESS OF A SUAVE SOUTH WIND SHOWER
IT WAS LONG
WILL IT BE COOL WILL IT BE KIND
IT WAS KIND
TO MY CHECKED BRIDLED DISCIPLINED EXPECTATION IT SEEMED VERY KIND
TO MY LONGING AND FAMISHED THOUGHT IT SEEMED PERHAPS KINDER THAN IT
WAS
SO LITTLE HAD I HOPED SO MUCH HAD I FEARED THERE WAS A FULNESS OF
DELIGHT IN THIS TASTE OF FRUITION SUCH PERHAPS AS MANY A HUMAN BEING
PASSES THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT EVER KNOWING
THE POOR ENGLISH TEACHER IN
THE FROSTY GARRET READING BY A DIM CANDLE GUTTERING IN THE WINTRY AIR
A LETTER SIMPLY GOOD NATURED NOTHING MORE THOUGH THAT GOOD NATURE
THEN SEEMED TO ME GODLIKE WAS HAPPIER THAN MOST QUEENS IN PALACES
OF COURSE HAPPINESS OF SUCH SHALLOW ORIGIN COULD BE BUT BRIEF YET
WHILE IT LASTED IT WAS GENUINE AND EXQUISITE A BUBBLE BUT A SWEET
BUBBLE OF REAL HONEY DEW
DR
JOHN HAD WRITTEN TO ME AT LENGTH HE HAD
WRITTEN TO ME WITH PLEASURE HE HAD WRITTEN WITH BENIGNANT MOOD
DWELLING WITH SUNNY SATISFACTION ON SCENES THAT HAD PASSED BEFORE HIS
EYES AND MINE ON PLACES WE HAD VISITED TOGETHER ON CONVERSATIONS WE
HAD HELD ON ALL THE LITTLE SUBJECT MATTER IN SHORT OF THE LAST FEW
HALCYON WEEKS
BUT THE CORDIAL CORE OF THE DELIGHT WAS A CONVICTION
THE BLITHE GENIAL LANGUAGE GENEROUSLY IMPARTED THAT IT HAD BEEN
POURED OUT NOT MERELY TO CONTENT ME BUT TO GRATIFY HIMSELF
A
GRATIFICATION HE MIGHT NEVER MORE DESIRE NEVER MORE SEEK AN
HYPOTHESIS IN EVERY POINT OF VIEW APPROACHING THE CERTAIN BUT THAT
CONCERNED THE FUTURE
THIS PRESENT MOMENT HAD NO PAIN NO BLOT NO
WANT FULL PURE PERFECT IT DEEPLY BLESSED ME
A PASSING SERAPH
SEEMED TO HAVE RESTED BESIDE ME LEANED TOWARDS MY HEART AND REPOSED
ON ITS THROB A SOFTENING COOLING HEALING HALLOWING WING
DR
JOHN
YOU PAINED ME AFTERWARDS FORGIVEN BE EVERY ILL FREELY FORGIVEN FOR
THE SAKE OF THAT ONE DEAR REMEMBERED GOOD
ARE THERE WICKED THINGS NOT HUMAN WHICH ENVY HUMAN BLISS ARE THERE
EVIL INFLUENCES HAUNTING THE AIR AND POISONING IT FOR MAN WHAT WAS
NEAR ME
SOMETHING IN THAT VAST SOLITARY GARRET SOUNDED STRANGELY
MOST SURELY
AND CERTAINLY I HEARD AS IT SEEMED A STEALTHY FOOT ON THAT FLOOR A
SORT OF GLIDING OUT FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE BLACK RECESS HAUNTED BY
THE MALEFACTOR CLOAKS
I TURNED MY LIGHT WAS DIM THE ROOM WAS
LONG BUT AS I LIVE I SAW IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT GHOSTLY CHAMBER A
FIGURE ALL BLACK AND WHITE THE SKIRTS STRAIGHT NARROW BLACK THE
HEAD BANDAGED VEILED WHITE
SAY WHAT YOU WILL READER TELL ME I WAS NERVOUS OR MAD AFFIRM THAT I
WAS UNSETTLED BY THE EXCITEMENT OF THAT LETTER DECLARE THAT I DREAMED
THIS I VOW I SAW THERE IN THAT ROOM ON THAT NIGHT AN IMAGE LIKE A
NUN
I CRIED OUT I SICKENED
HAD THE SHAPE APPROACHED ME I MIGHT HAVE
SWOONED
IT RECEDED I MADE FOR THE DOOR
HOW I DESCENDED ALL THE
STAIRS I KNOW NOT
BY INSTINCT I SHUNNED THE REFECTORY AND SHAPED MY
COURSE TO MADAME'S SITTING ROOM I BURST IN
I SAID
THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE GRENIER I HAVE BEEN THERE I SAW SOMETHING
GO AND LOOK AT IT ALL OF YOU
I SAID ALL OF YOU FOR THE ROOM SEEMED TO ME FULL OF PEOPLE THOUGH
IN TRUTH THERE WERE BUT FOUR PRESENT MADAME BECK HER MOTHER MADAME
KINT WHO WAS OUT OF HEALTH AND NOW STAYING WITH HER ON A VISIT HER
BROTHER M
VICTOR KINT AND ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WHO WHEN I ENTERED THE
ROOM WAS CONVERSING WITH THE OLD LADY AND HAD HIS BACK TOWARDS THE
DOOR
MY MORTAL FEAR AND FAINTNESS MUST HAVE MADE ME DEADLY PALE
I FELT COLD
AND SHAKING
THEY ALL ROSE IN CONSTERNATION THEY SURROUNDED ME
I
URGED THEM TO GO TO THE GRENIER THE SIGHT OF THE GENTLEMEN DID ME GOOD
AND GAVE ME COURAGE IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WERE SOME HELP AND HOPE
WITH MEN AT HAND
I TURNED TO THE DOOR BECKONING THEM TO FOLLOW
THEY
WANTED TO STOP ME BUT I SAID THEY MUST COME THIS WAY THEY MUST SEE
WHAT I HAD SEEN SOMETHING STRANGE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
GARRET
AND NOW I REMEMBERED MY LETTER LEFT ON THE DRAWERS WITH THE
LIGHT
THIS PRECIOUS LETTER FLESH OR SPIRIT MUST BE DEFIED FOR ITS
SAKE
I FLEW UP STAIRS HASTENING THE FASTER AS I KNEW I WAS FOLLOWED
THEY WERE OBLIGED TO COME
LO WHEN I REACHED THE GARRET DOOR ALL WITHIN WAS DARK AS A PIT THE
LIGHT WAS OUT
HAPPILY SOME ONE MADAME I THINK WITH HER USUAL CALM
SENSE HAD BROUGHT A LAMP FROM THE ROOM SPEEDILY THEREFORE AS THEY
CAME UP A RAY PIERCED THE OPAQUE BLACKNESS
THERE STOOD THE BOUGIE
QUENCHED ON THE DRAWERS BUT WHERE WAS THE LETTER AND I LOOKED FOR
THAT NOW AND NOT FOR THE NUN
MY LETTER MY LETTER I PANTED AND PLAINED ALMOST BESIDE MYSELF
I
GROPED ON THE FLOOR WRINGING MY HANDS WILDLY
CRUEL CRUEL DOOM TO
HAVE MY BIT OF COMFORT PRETERNATURALLY SNATCHED FROM ME ERE I HAD WELL
TASTED ITS VIRTUE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHERS WERE DOING I COULD NOT WATCH THEM THEY
ASKED ME QUESTIONS I DID NOT ANSWER THEY RANSACKED ALL CORNERS THEY
PRATTLED ABOUT THIS AND THAT DISARRANGEMENT OF CLOAKS A BREACH OR
CRACK IN THE SKY LIGHT I KNOW NOT WHAT

EYES HAD I RECOGNISED THE TONE DID I NOW LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE
WRITER OF THAT VERY LETTER WAS THIS GENTLEMAN NEAR ME IN THIS DIM
GARRET JOHN GRAHAM DR
BRETTON HIMSELF

SOME ACCESS OF ILLNESS IN OLD MADAME KINT HE WAS THE SECOND GENTLEMAN
PRESENT IN THE SALLE MANGER WHEN I ENTERED
WAS IT MY LETTER LUCY
YOUR OWN YOURS THE LETTER YOU WROTE TO ME
I HAD COME HERE TO READ
IT QUIETLY
I COULD NOT FIND ANOTHER SPOT WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HAVE
IT TO MYSELF
I HAD SAVED IT ALL DAY NEVER OPENED IT TILL THIS
EVENING IT WAS SCARCELY GLANCED OVER I CANNOT BEAR TO LOSE IT
OH

HUSH COME OUT OF THIS COLD ROOM THEY ARE GOING TO SEND FOR THE POLICE
NOW TO EXAMINE FURTHER WE NEED NOT STAY HERE COME WE WILL GO DOWN
A WARM HAND TAKING MY COLD FINGERS LED ME DOWN TO A ROOM WHERE THERE
WAS A FIRE
DR
JOHN AND I SAT BEFORE THE STOVE
HE TALKED TO ME AND
SOOTHED ME WITH UNUTTERABLE GOODNESS PROMISING ME TWENTY LETTERS FOR
THE ONE LOST
IF THERE ARE WORDS AND WRONGS LIKE KNIVES WHOSE
DEEP INFLICTED LACERATIONS NEVER HEAL CUTTING INJURIES AND INSULTS OF
SERRATED AND POISON DRIPPING EDGE SO TOO THERE ARE CONSOLATIONS OF
TONE TOO FINE FOR THE EAR NOT FONDLY AND FOR EVER TO RETAIN THEIR ECHO
CARESSING KINDNESSES LOVED LINGERED OVER THROUGH A WHOLE LIFE
RECALLED WITH UNFADED TENDERNESS AND ANSWERING THE CALL WITH UNDIMMED
SHINE OUT OF THAT RAVEN CLOUD FORESHADOWING DEATH HIMSELF
I HAVE BEEN
TOLD SINCE THAT DR
BRETTON WAS NOT NEARLY SO PERFECT AS I THOUGHT HIM
THAT HIS ACTUAL CHARACTER LACKED THE DEPTH HEIGHT COMPASS AND
ENDURANCE IT POSSESSED IN MY CREED
I DON'T KNOW HE WAS AS GOOD TO ME
AS THE WELL IS TO THE PARCHED WAYFARER AS THE SUN TO THE SHIVERING
JAILBIRD
I REMEMBER HIM HEROIC
HEROIC AT THIS MOMENT WILL I HOLD HIM
TO BE
HE ASKED ME SMILING WHY I CARED FOR HIS LETTER SO VERY MUCH
I
THOUGHT BUT DID NOT SAY THAT I PRIZED IT LIKE THE BLOOD IN MY VEINS
I ONLY ANSWERED THAT I HAD SO FEW LETTERS TO CARE FOR
I AM SURE YOU DID NOT READ IT SAID HE OR YOU WOULD THINK NOTHING
OF IT
I READ IT BUT ONLY ONCE
I WANT TO READ IT AGAIN
I AM SORRY IT IS
LOST AND I COULD NOT HELP WEEPING AFRESH
LUCY LUCY MY POOR LITTLE GOD SISTER IF THERE BE SUCH A
RELATIONSHIP HERE HERE IS YOUR LETTER
WHY IS IT NOT BETTER WORTH
SUCH TEARS AND SUCH TENDERLY EXAGGERATING FAITH
CURIOUS CHARACTERISTIC MANOEUVRE HIS QUICK EYE HAD SEEN THE LETTER ON
THE FLOOR WHERE I SOUGHT IT HIS HAND AS QUICK HAD SNATCHED IT UP
HE
HAD HIDDEN IT IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
IF MY TROUBLE HAD WROUGHT WITH A
WHIT LESS STRESS AND REALITY I DOUBT WHETHER HE WOULD EVER HAVE
ACKNOWLEDGED OR RESTORED IT
TEARS OF TEMPERATURE ONE DEGREE COOLER
THAN THOSE I SHED WOULD ONLY HAVE AMUSED DR
JOHN
PLEASURE AT REGAINING MADE ME FORGET MERITED REPROACH FOR THE TEASING
TORMENT MY JOY WAS GREAT IT COULD NOT BE CONCEALED YET I THINK IT
BROKE OUT MORE IN COUNTENANCE THAN LANGUAGE
I SAID LITTLE
ARE YOU SATISFIED NOW ASKED DR
JOHN
I REPLIED THAT I WAS SATISFIED AND HAPPY
WELL THEN HE PROCEEDED HOW DO YOU FEEL PHYSICALLY ARE YOU GROWING
CALMER NOT MUCH FOR YOU TREMBLE LIKE A LEAF STILL
IT SEEMED TO ME HOWEVER THAT I WAS SUFFICIENTLY CALM AT LEAST I FELT
NO LONGER TERRIFIED
I EXPRESSED MYSELF COMPOSED
YOU ARE ABLE CONSEQUENTLY TO TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW YOUR ACCOUNT WAS
QUITE VAGUE DO YOU KNOW YOU LOOKED WHITE AS THE WALL BUT YOU ONLY
SPOKE OF 'SOMETHING NOT DEFINING WHAT
WAS IT A MAN WAS IT AN
ANIMAL WHAT WAS IT
I NEVER WILL TELL EXACTLY WHAT I SAW SAID I UNLESS SOME ONE ELSE
SEES IT TOO AND THEN I WILL GIVE CORROBORATIVE TESTIMONY BUT
OTHERWISE I SHALL BE DISCREDITED AND ACCUSED OF DREAMING
TELL ME SAID DR
BRETTON I WILL HEAR IT IN MY PROFESSIONAL
CHARACTER I LOOK ON YOU NOW FROM A PROFESSIONAL POINT OF VIEW AND I
READ PERHAPS ALL YOU WOULD CONCEAL IN YOUR EYE WHICH IS CURIOUSLY
VIVID AND RESTLESS IN YOUR CHEEK WHICH THE BLOOD HAS FORSAKEN IN
YOUR HAND WHICH YOU CANNOT STEADY
COME LUCY SPEAK AND TELL ME
YOU WOULD LAUGH
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME YOU SHALL HAVE NO MORE LETTERS
YOU ARE LAUGHING NOW
I WILL AGAIN TAKE AWAY THAT SINGLE EPISTLE BEING MINE I THINK I HAVE
A RIGHT TO RECLAIM IT
I FELT RAILLERY IN HIS WORDS IT MADE ME GRAVE AND QUIET BUT I FOLDED
UP THE LETTER AND COVERED IT FROM SIGHT
YOU MAY HIDE IT BUT I CAN POSSESS IT ANY MOMENT I CHOOSE
YOU DON'T
KNOW MY SKILL IN SLEIGHT OF HAND I MIGHT PRACTISE AS A CONJUROR IF I
LIKED
MAMMA SAYS SOMETIMES TOO THAT I HAVE A HARMONIZING PROPERTY OF
TONGUE AND EYE BUT YOU NEVER SAW THAT IN ME DID YOU LUCY
INDEED INDEED WHEN YOU WERE A MERE BOY I USED TO SEE BOTH FAR MORE
THEN THAN NOW FOR NOW YOU ARE STRONG AND STRENGTH DISPENSES WITH
SUBTLETY
BUT STILL DR
JOHN YOU HAVE WHAT THEY CALL IN THIS COUNTRY
'UN AIR FIN THAT NOBODY CAN MISTAKE
MADAME BECK SAW IT AND
AND LIKED IT SAID HE LAUGHING BECAUSE SHE HAS IT HERSELF
BUT
LUCY GIVE ME THAT LETTER YOU DON'T REALLY CARE FOR IT
TO THIS PROVOCATIVE SPEECH I MADE NO ANSWER
GRAHAM IN MIRTHFUL MOOD
MUST NOT BE HUMOURED TOO FAR
JUST NOW THERE WAS A NEW SORT OF SMILE
PLAYING ABOUT HIS LIPS VERY SWEET BUT IT GRIEVED ME SOMEHOW A NEW
SORT OF LIGHT SPARKLING IN HIS EYES NOT HOSTILE BUT NOT REASSURING
I
ROSE TO GO I BID HIM GOOD NIGHT A LITTLE SADLY
HIS SENSITIVENESS THAT PECULIAR APPREHENSIVE DETECTIVE FACULTY OF
HIS FELT IN A MOMENT THE UNSPOKEN COMPLAINT THE SCARCE THOUGHT
REPROACH
HE ASKED QUIETLY IF I WAS OFFENDED
I SHOOK MY HEAD AS
IMPLYING A NEGATIVE
PERMIT ME THEN TO SPEAK A LITTLE SERIOUSLY TO YOU BEFORE YOU GO
YOU
ARE IN A HIGHLY NERVOUS STATE
I FEEL SURE FROM WHAT IS APPARENT IN
YOUR LOOK AND MANNER HOWEVER WELL CONTROLLED THAT WHILST ALONE THIS
EVENING IN THAT DISMAL PERISHING SEPULCHRAL GARRET THAT DUNGEON UNDER
THE LEADS SMELLING OF DAMP AND MOULD RANK WITH PHTHISIS AND CATARRH
A PLACE YOU NEVER OUGHT TO ENTER THAT YOU SAW OR THOUGHT YOU SAW
SOME APPEARANCE PECULIARLY CALCULATED TO IMPRESS THE IMAGINATION
I
KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT NOR EVER WERE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL TERRORS
FEARS OF ROBBERS C I AM NOT SO SURE THAT A VISITATION BEARING A
SPECTRAL CHARACTER WOULD NOT SHAKE YOUR VERY MIND
BE CALM NOW
THIS
IS ALL A MATTER OF THE NERVES I SEE BUT JUST SPECIFY THE VISION
YOU WILL TELL NOBODY
NOBODY MOST CERTAINLY
YOU MAY TRUST ME AS IMPLICITLY AS YOU DID PRE
SILAS
INDEED THE DOCTOR IS PERHAPS THE SAFER CONFESSOR OF THE TWO
THOUGH HE HAS NOT GREY HAIR
YOU WILL NOT LAUGH
PERHAPS I MAY TO DO YOU GOOD BUT NOT IN SCORN
LUCY I FEEL AS A
FRIEND TOWARDS YOU THOUGH YOUR TIMID NATURE IS SLOW TO TRUST
HE NOW LOOKED LIKE A FRIEND THAT INDESCRIBABLE SMILE AND SPARKLE WERE
GONE THOSE FORMIDABLE ARCHED CURVES OF LIP NOSTRIL EYEBROW WERE
DEPRESSED REPOSE MARKED HIS ATTITUDE ATTENTION SOBERED HIS ASPECT
WON TO CONFIDENCE I TOLD HIM EXACTLY WHAT I HAD SEEN ERE NOW I HAD
NARRATED TO HIM THE LEGEND OF THE HOUSE WHILING AWAY WITH THAT
NARRATIVE AN HOUR OF A CERTAIN MILD OCTOBER AFTERNOON WHEN HE AND I
RODE THROUGH BOIS L'ETANG
HE SAT AND THOUGHT AND WHILE HE THOUGHT WE HEARD THEM ALL COMING
DOWN STAIRS
ARE THEY GOING TO INTERRUPT SAID HE GLANCING AT THE DOOR WITH AN
ANNOYED EXPRESSION
THEY WILL NOT COME HERE I ANSWERED FOR WE WERE IN THE LITTLE SALON
WHERE MADAME NEVER SAT IN THE EVENING AND WHERE IT WAS BY MERE CHANCE
THAT HEAT WAS STILL LINGERING IN THE STOVE
THEY PASSED THE DOOR AND
WENT ON TO THE SALLE MANGER
NOW HE PURSUED THEY WILL TALK ABOUT THIEVES BURGLARS AND SO ON
LET THEM DO SO MIND YOU SAY NOTHING AND KEEP YOUR RESOLUTION OF
DESCRIBING YOUR NUN TO NOBODY
SHE MAY APPEAR TO YOU AGAIN DON'T
START
YOU THINK THEN I SAID WITH SECRET HORROR SHE CAME OUT OF MY
BRAIN AND IS NOW GONE IN THERE AND MAY GLIDE OUT AGAIN AT AN HOUR AND
A DAY WHEN I LOOK NOT FOR HER
I THINK IT A CASE OF SPECTRAL ILLUSION I FEAR FOLLOWING ON AND
RESULTING FROM LONG CONTINUED MENTAL CONFLICT
OH DOCTOR JOHN I SHUDDER AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING LIABLE TO SUCH AN
ILLUSION IT SEEMED SO REAL
IS THERE NO CURE NO PREVENTIVE
HAPPINESS IS THE CURE A CHEERFUL MIND THE PREVENTIVE CULTIVATE BOTH
NO MOCKERY IN THIS WORLD EVER SOUNDS TO ME SO HOLLOW AS THAT OF BEING
TOLD TO CULTIVATE HAPPINESS
WHAT DOES SUCH ADVICE MEAN HAPPINESS IS
NOT A POTATO TO BE PLANTED IN MOULD AND TILLED WITH MANURE
HAPPINESS
IS A GLORY SHINING FAR DOWN UPON US OUT OF HEAVEN
SHE IS A DIVINE DEW
WHICH THE SOUL ON CERTAIN OF ITS SUMMER MORNINGS FEELS DROPPING UPON
IT FROM THE AMARANTH BLOOM AND GOLDEN FRUITAGE OF PARADISE
CULTIVATE HAPPINESS I SAID BRIEFLY TO THE DOCTOR DO YOU
CULTIVATE HAPPINESS HOW DO YOU MANAGE
I AM A CHEERFUL FELLOW BY NATURE AND THEN ILL LUCK HAS NEVER DOGGED
ME
ADVERSITY GAVE ME AND MY MOTHER ONE PASSING SCOWL AND BRUSH BUT WE
DEFIED HER OR RATHER LAUGHED AT HER AND SHE WENT BY
THERE IS NO CULTIVATION IN ALL THIS
I DO NOT GIVE WAY TO MELANCHOLY
YES I HAVE SEEN YOU SUBDUED BY THAT FEELING
ABOUT GINEVRA FANSHAWE EH
DID SHE NOT SOMETIMES MAKE YOU MISERABLE
POOH STUFF NONSENSE YOU SEE I AM BETTER NOW
IF A LAUGHING EYE WITH A LIVELY LIGHT AND A FACE BRIGHT WITH BEAMING
AND HEALTHY ENERGY COULD ATTEST THAT HE WAS BETTER BETTER HE
CERTAINLY WAS
YOU DO NOT LOOK MUCH AMISS OR GREATLY OUT OF CONDITION I ALLOWED
AND WHY LUCY CAN'T YOU LOOK AND FEEL AS I DO BUOYANT COURAGEOUS
AND FIT TO DEFY ALL THE NUNS AND FLIRTS IN CHRISTENDOM I WOULD GIVE
GOLD ON THE SPOT JUST TO SEE YOU SNAP YOUR FINGERS
TRY THE MANOEUVRE
IF I WERE TO BRING MISS FANSHAWE INTO YOUR PRESENCE JUST NOW
I VOW LUCY SHE SHOULD NOT MOVE ME OR SHE SHOULD MOVE ME BUT BY ONE
THING TRUE YES AND PASSIONATE LOVE
I WOULD ACCORD FORGIVENESS AT NO
LESS A PRICE
INDEED A SMILE OF HERS WOULD HAVE BEEN A FORTUNE TO YOU A WHILE
SINCE
TRANSFORMED LUCY TRANSFORMED REMEMBER YOU ONCE CALLED ME A SLAVE
BUT I AM A FREE MAN NOW
HE STOOD UP IN THE PORT OF HIS HEAD THE CARRIAGE OF HIS FIGURE IN
HIS BEAMING EYE AND MIEN THERE REVEALED ITSELF A LIBERTY WHICH WAS
MORE THAN EASE A MOOD WHICH WAS DISDAIN OF HIS PAST BONDAGE
MISS FANSHAWE HE PURSUED HAS LED ME THROUGH A PHASE OF FEELING
WHICH IS OVER I HAVE ENTERED ANOTHER CONDITION AND AM NOW MUCH
DISPOSED TO EXACT LOVE FOR LOVE PASSION FOR PASSION AND GOOD MEASURE
OF IT TOO
AH DOCTOR DOCTOR YOU SAID IT WAS YOUR NATURE TO PURSUE LOVE UNDER
DIFFICULTIES TO BE CHARMED BY A PROUD INSENSIBILITY
HE LAUGHED AND ANSWERED MY NATURE VARIES THE MOOD OF ONE HOUR IS
SOMETIMES THE MOCKERY OF THE NEXT
WELL LUCY DRAWING ON HIS GLOVES
WILL THE NUN COME AGAIN TO NIGHT THINK YOU
I DON'T THINK SHE WILL
GIVE HER MY COMPLIMENTS IF SHE DOES DR
JOHN'S COMPLIMENTS AND
ENTREAT HER TO HAVE THE GOODNESS TO WAIT A VISIT FROM HIM
LUCY WAS
SHE A PRETTY NUN HAD SHE A PRETTY FACE YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME THAT YET
AND THAT IS THE REALLY IMPORTANT POINT
SHE HAD A WHITE CLOTH OVER HER FACE SAID I BUT HER EYES GLITTERED
CONFUSION TO HER GOBLIN TRAPPINGS CRIED HE IRREVERENTLY BUT AT
LEAST SHE HAD HANDSOME EYES BRIGHT AND SOFT
COLD AND FIXED WAS THE REPLY
NO NO WE'LL NONE OF HER SHE SHALL NOT HAUNT YOU LUCY
GIVE HER
THAT SHAKE OF THE HAND IF SHE COMES AGAIN
WILL SHE STAND THAT DO
YOU THINK
I THOUGHT IT TOO KIND AND CORDIAL FOR A GHOST TO STAND AND SO WAS THE
SMILE WHICH MATCHED IT AND ACCOMPANIED HIS GOOD NIGHT
AND HAD THERE BEEN ANYTHING IN THE GARRET WHAT DID THEY DISCOVER I
BELIEVE ON THE CLOSEST EXAMINATION THEIR DISCOVERIES AMOUNTED TO VERY
LITTLE
THEY TALKED AT FIRST OF THE CLOAKS BEING DISTURBED BUT
MADAME BECK TOLD ME AFTERWARDS SHE THOUGHT THEY HUNG MUCH AS USUAL AND
AS FOR THE BROKEN PANE IN THE SKYLIGHT SHE AFFIRMED THAT APERTURE WAS
RARELY WITHOUT ONE OR MORE PANES BROKEN OR CRACKED AND BESIDES A
HEAVY HAIL STORM HAD FALLEN A FEW DAYS AGO
MADAME QUESTIONED ME VERY
CLOSELY AS TO WHAT I HAD SEEN BUT I ONLY DESCRIBED AN OBSCURE FIGURE
CLOTHED IN BLACK I TOOK CARE NOT TO BREATHE THE WORD NUN CERTAIN
THAT THIS WORD WOULD AT ONCE SUGGEST TO HER MIND AN IDEA OF ROMANCE AND
UNREALITY
SHE CHARGED ME TO SAY NOTHING ON THE SUBJECT TO ANY SERVANT
PUPIL OR TEACHER AND HIGHLY COMMENDED MY DISCRETION IN COMING TO HER
PRIVATE SALLE MANGER INSTEAD OF CARRYING THE TALE OF HORROR TO THE
SCHOOL REFECTORY
THUS THE SUBJECT DROPPED
I WAS LEFT SECRETLY AND
SADLY TO WONDER IN MY OWN MIND WHETHER THAT STRANGE THING WAS OF THIS
WORLD OR OF A REALM BEYOND THE GRAVE OR WHETHER INDEED IT WAS ONLY
THE CHILD OF MALADY AND I OF THAT MALADY THE PREY
CHAPTER XXIII
VASHTI
TO WONDER SADLY DID I SAY NO A NEW INFLUENCE BEGAN TO ACT UPON MY
LIFE AND SADNESS FOR A CERTAIN SPACE WAS HELD AT BAY
CONCEIVE A
DELL DEEP HOLLOWED IN FOREST SECRESY IT LIES IN DIMNESS AND MIST ITS
TURF IS DANK ITS HERBAGE PALE AND HUMID
A STORM OR AN AXE MAKES A
WIDE GAP AMONGST THE OAK TREES THE BREEZE SWEEPS IN THE SUN LOOKS
DOWN THE SAD COLD DELL BECOMES A DEEP CUP OF LUSTRE HIGH SUMMER
POURS HER BLUE GLORY AND HER GOLDEN LIGHT OUT OF THAT BEAUTEOUS SKY
WHICH TILL NOW THE STARVED HOLLOW NEVER SAW
A NEW CREED BECAME MINE A BELIEF IN HAPPINESS
IT WAS THREE WEEKS SINCE THE ADVENTURE OF THE GARRET AND I POSSESSED
IN THAT CASE BOX DRAWER UP STAIRS CASKETED WITH THAT FIRST LETTER
FOUR COMPANIONS LIKE TO IT TRACED BY THE SAME FIRM PEN SEALED WITH
THE SAME CLEAR SEAL FULL OF THE SAME VITAL COMFORT
VITAL COMFORT IT
SEEMED TO ME THEN I READ THEM IN AFTER YEARS THEY WERE KIND LETTERS
ENOUGH PLEASING LETTERS BECAUSE COMPOSED BY ONE WELL PLEASED IN THE
TWO LAST THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR CLOSING LINES HALF GAY HALF TENDER
BY FEELING TOUCHED BUT NOT SUBDUED TIME DEAR READER MELLOWED
THEM TO A BEVERAGE OF THIS MILD QUALITY BUT WHEN I FIRST TASTED THEIR
ELIXIR FRESH FROM THE FOUNT SO HONOURED IT SEEMED JUICE OF A DIVINE
VINTAGE A DRAUGHT WHICH HEBE MIGHT FILL AND THE VERY GODS APPROVE
DOES THE READER REMEMBERING WHAT WAS SAID SOME PAGES BACK CARE TO ASK
HOW I ANSWERED THESE LETTERS WHETHER UNDER THE DRY STINTING CHECK OF
REASON OR ACCORDING TO THE FULL LIBERAL IMPULSE OF FEELING
TO SPEAK TRUTH I COMPROMISED MATTERS I SERVED TWO MASTERS I BOWED
DOWN IN THE HOUSES OF RIMMON AND LIFTED THE HEART AT ANOTHER SHRINE
I
WROTE TO THESE LETTERS TWO ANSWERS ONE FOR MY OWN RELIEF THE OTHER
FOR GRAHAM'S PERUSAL
TO BEGIN WITH FEELING AND I TURNED REASON OUT OF DOORS DREW AGAINST
HER BAR AND BOLT THEN WE SAT DOWN SPREAD OUR PAPER DIPPED IN THE INK
AN EAGER PEN AND WITH DEEP ENJOYMENT POURED OUT OUR SINCERE HEART
WHEN WE HAD DONE WHEN TWO SHEETS WERE COVERED WITH THE LANGUAGE OF A
STRONGLY ADHERENT AFFECTION A ROOTED AND ACTIVE GRATITUDE ONCE FOR
ALL IN THIS PARENTHESIS I DISCLAIM WITH THE UTMOST SCORN EVERY
SNEAKING SUSPICION OF WHAT ARE CALLED WARMER FEELINGS WOMEN DO NOT
ENTERTAIN THESE WARMER FEELINGS WHERE FROM THE COMMENCEMENT THROUGH
THE WHOLE PROGRESS OF AN ACQUAINTANCE THEY HAVE NEVER ONCE BEEN
CHEATED OF THE CONVICTION THAT TO DO SO WOULD BE TO COMMIT A MORTAL
ABSURDITY NOBODY EVER LAUNCHES INTO LOVE UNLESS HE HAS SEEN OR DREAMED
THE RISING OF HOPE'S STAR OVER LOVE'S TROUBLED WATERS WHEN THEN I
HAD GIVEN EXPRESSION TO A CLOSELY CLINGING AND DEEPLY HONOURING
ATTACHMENT AN ATTACHMENT THAT WANTED TO ATTRACT TO ITSELF AND TAKE TO
ITS OWN LOT ALL THAT WAS PAINFUL IN THE DESTINY OF ITS OBJECT THAT
WOULD IF IT COULD HAVE ABSORBED AND CONDUCTED AWAY ALL STORMS AND
LIGHTNINGS FROM AN EXISTENCE VIEWED WITH A PASSION OF SOLICITUDE THEN
JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE DOORS OF MY HEART WOULD SHAKE BOLT AND BAR
WOULD YIELD REASON WOULD LEAP IN VIGOROUS AND REVENGEFUL SNATCH THE
FULL SHEETS READ SNEER ERASE TEAR UP RE WRITE FOLD SEAL DIRECT
AND SEND A TERSE CURT MISSIVE OF A PAGE
SHE DID RIGHT
I DID NOT LIVE ON LETTERS ONLY I WAS VISITED I WAS LOOKED AFTER ONCE
A WEEK I WAS TAKEN OUT TO LA TERRASSE ALWAYS I WAS MADE MUCH OF
DR
BRETTON FAILED NOT TO TELL ME WHY HE WAS SO KIND TO KEEP AWAY THE
NUN HE SAID HE WAS DETERMINED TO DISPUTE WITH HER HER PREY
HE HAD
TAKEN HE DECLARED A THOROUGH DISLIKE TO HER CHIEFLY ON ACCOUNT OF
THAT WHITE FACE CLOTH AND THOSE COLD GREY EYES THE MOMENT HE HEARD OF
THOSE ODIOUS PARTICULARS HE AFFIRMED CONSUMMATE DISGUST HAD INCITED
HIM TO OPPOSE HER HE WAS DETERMINED TO TRY WHETHER HE OR SHE WAS THE
CLEVEREST AND HE ONLY WISHED SHE WOULD ONCE MORE LOOK IN UPON ME WHEN
HE WAS PRESENT BUT THAT SHE NEVER DID
IN SHORT HE REGARDED ME
SCIENTIFICALLY IN THE LIGHT OF A PATIENT AND AT ONCE EXERCISED HIS
PROFESSIONAL SKILL AND GRATIFIED HIS NATURAL BENEVOLENCE BY A COURSE
OF CORDIAL AND ATTENTIVE TREATMENT
ONE EVENING THE FIRST IN DECEMBER I WAS WALKING BY MYSELF IN THE
CARR IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK THE CLASSE DOORS WERE CLOSED BUT WITHIN
THE PUPILS RAMPANT IN THE LICENCE OF EVENING RECREATION WERE
COUNTERFEITING A MINIATURE CHAOS
THE CARR WAS QUITE DARK EXCEPT A
RED LIGHT SHINING UNDER AND ABOUT THE STOVE THE WIDE GLASS DOORS AND
THE LONG WINDOWS WERE FROSTED OVER A CRYSTAL SPARKLE OF STARLIGHT
HERE AND THERE SPANGLING THIS BLANCHED WINTER VEIL AND BREAKING WITH
SCATTERED BRILLIANCE THE PALENESS OF ITS EMBROIDERY PROVED IT A CLEAR
NIGHT THOUGH MOONLESS
THAT I SHOULD DARE TO REMAIN THUS ALONE IN
DARKNESS SHOWED THAT MY NERVES WERE REGAINING A HEALTHY TONE I
THOUGHT OF THE NUN BUT HARDLY FEARED HER THOUGH THE STAIRCASE WAS
BEHIND ME LEADING UP THROUGH BLIND BLACK NIGHT FROM LANDING TO
LANDING TO THE HAUNTED GRENIER
YET I OWN MY HEART QUAKED MY PULSE
LEAPED WHEN I SUDDENLY HEARD BREATHING AND RUSTLING AND TURNING SAW
IN THE DEEP SHADOW OF THE STEPS A DEEPER SHADOW STILL A SHAPE THAT
MOVED AND DESCENDED
IT PAUSED A WHILE AT THE CLASSE DOOR AND THEN IT
GLIDED BEFORE ME
SIMULTANEOUSLY CAME A CLANGOR OF THE DISTANT
DOOR BELL
LIFE LIKE SOUNDS BRING LIFE LIKE FEELINGS THIS SHAPE WAS
TOO ROUND AND LOW FOR MY GAUNT NUN IT WAS ONLY MADAME BECK ON DUTY
MADEMOISELLE LUCY CRIED ROSINE BURSTING IN LAMP IN HAND FROM THE
CORRIDOR ON EST L POUR VOUS AU SALON
MADAME SAW ME I SAW MADAME ROSINE SAW US BOTH THERE WAS NO MUTUAL
RECOGNITION
I MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE SALON
THERE I FOUND WHAT I OWN I
ANTICIPATED I SHOULD FIND DR
BRETTON BUT HE WAS IN EVENING DRESS
THE CARRIAGE IS AT THE DOOR SAID HE MY MOTHER HAS SENT IT TO TAKE
YOU TO THE THEATRE SHE WAS GOING HERSELF BUT AN ARRIVAL HAS PREVENTED
HER SHE IMMEDIATELY SAID 'TAKE LUCY IN MY PLACE WILL YOU GO
JUST NOW I AM NOT DRESSED CRIED I GLANCING DESPAIRINGLY AT MY DARK
MERINO
YOU HAVE HALF AN HOUR TO DRESS
I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU NOTICE BUT I
ONLY DETERMINED ON GOING SINCE FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN I HEARD THERE WAS TO
BE A GENUINE REGALE IN THE PRESENCE OF A GREAT ACTRESS
AND HE MENTIONED A NAME THAT THRILLED ME A NAME THAT IN THOSE DAYS
COULD THRILL EUROPE
IT IS HUSHED NOW ITS ONCE RESTLESS ECHOES ARE ALL
STILL SHE WHO BORE IT WENT YEARS AGO TO HER REST NIGHT AND OBLIVION
LONG SINCE CLOSED ABOVE HER BUT THEN HER DAY A DAY OF SIRIUS STOOD
AT ITS FULL HEIGHT LIGHT AND FERVOUR
I'LL GO I WILL BE READY IN TEN MINUTES I VOWED
AND AWAY I FLEW
NEVER ONCE CHECKED READER BY THE THOUGHT WHICH PERHAPS AT THIS MOMENT
CHECKS YOU NAMELY THAT TO GO ANYWHERE WITH GRAHAM AND WITHOUT MRS
BRETTON COULD BE OBJECTIONABLE
I COULD NOT HAVE CONCEIVED MUCH LESS
HAVE EXPRESSED TO GRAHAM SUCH THOUGHT SUCH SCRUPLE WITHOUT RISK OF
EXCITING A TYRANNOUS SELF CONTEMPT OF KINDLING AN INWARD FIRE OF SHAME
SO QUENCHLESS AND SO DEVOURING THAT I THINK IT WOULD SOON HAVE LICKED
UP THE VERY LIFE IN MY VEINS
BESIDES MY GODMOTHER KNOWING HER SON
AND KNOWING ME WOULD AS SOON HAVE THOUGHT OF CHAPERONING A SISTER WITH
A BROTHER AS OF KEEPING ANXIOUS GUARD OVER OUR INCOMINGS AND OUTGOINGS
THE PRESENT WAS NO OCCASION FOR SHOWY ARRAY MY DUN MIST CRAPE WOULD
SUFFICE AND I SOUGHT THE SAME IN THE GREAT OAK WARDROBE IN THE
DORMITORY WHERE HUNG NO LESS THAN FORTY DRESSES
BUT THERE HAD BEEN
CHANGES AND REFORMS AND SOME INNOVATING HAND HAD PRUNED THIS SAME
CROWDED WARDROBE AND CARRIED DIVERS GARMENTS TO THE GRENIER MY CRAPE
AMONGST THE REST
I MUST FETCH IT
I GOT THE KEY AND WENT ALOFT
FEARLESS ALMOST THOUGHTLESS
I UNLOCKED THE DOOR I PLUNGED IN
THE
READER MAY BELIEVE IT OR NOT BUT WHEN I THUS SUDDENLY ENTERED THAT
GARRET WAS NOT WHOLLY DARK AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FROM ONE POINT THERE
SHONE A SOLEMN LIGHT LIKE A STAR BUT BROADER
SO PLAINLY IT SHONE
THAT IT REVEALED THE DEEP ALCOVE WITH A PORTION OF THE TARNISHED
SCARLET CURTAIN DRAWN OVER IT
INSTANTLY SILENTLY BEFORE MY EYES IT
VANISHED SO DID THE CURTAIN AND ALCOVE ALL THAT END OF THE GARRET
BECAME BLACK AS NIGHT
I VENTURED NO RESEARCH I HAD NOT TIME NOR WILL
SNATCHING MY DRESS WHICH HUNG ON THE WALL HAPPILY NEAR THE DOOR I
RUSHED OUT RELOCKED THE DOOR WITH CONVULSED HASTE AND DARTED
DOWNWARDS TO THE DORMITORY
BUT I TREMBLED TOO MUCH TO DRESS MYSELF IMPOSSIBLE TO ARRANGE HAIR OR
FASTEN HOOKS AND EYES WITH SUCH FINGERS SO I CALLED ROSINE AND BRIBED
HER TO HELP ME
ROSINE LIKED A BRIBE SO SHE DID HER BEST SMOOTHED AND
PLAITED MY HAIR AS WELL AS A COIFFEUR WOULD HAVE DONE PLACED THE LACE
COLLAR MATHEMATICALLY STRAIGHT TIED THE NECK RIBBON ACCURATELY IN
SHORT DID HER WORK LIKE THE NEAT HANDED PHILLIS SHE COULD BE WHEN SHE
THOSE
HAVING GIVEN ME MY HANDKERCHIEF AND GLOVES SHE TOOK THE CANDLE
AND LIGHTED ME DOWN STAIRS
AFTER ALL I HAD FORGOTTEN MY SHAWL SHE
RAN BACK TO FETCH IT AND I STOOD WITH DR
JOHN IN THE VESTIBULE
WAITING
WHAT IS THIS LUCY SAID HE LOOKING DOWN AT ME NARROWLY
HERE IS
THE OLD EXCITEMENT
HA THE NUN AGAIN
BUT I UTTERLY DENIED THE CHARGE I WAS VEXED TO BE SUSPECTED OF A
SECOND ILLUSION
HE WAS SCEPTICAL
SHE HAS BEEN AS SURE AS I LIVE SAID HE HER FIGURE CROSSING YOUR
EYES LEAVES ON THEM A PECULIAR GLEAM AND EXPRESSION NOT TO BE MISTAKEN
SHE HAS NOT BEEN I PERSISTED FOR INDEED I COULD DENY HER
APPARITION WITH TRUTH
THE OLD SYMPTOMS ARE THERE HE AFFIRMED A PARTICULAR PALE AND WHAT
THE SCOTCH CALL A 'RAISED' LOOK
HE WAS SO OBSTINATE I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO TELL HIM WHAT I REALLY
HAD SEEN
OF COURSE WITH HIM IT WAS HELD TO BE ANOTHER EFFECT OF THE
SAME CAUSE IT WAS ALL OPTICAL ILLUSION NERVOUS MALADY AND SO ON
NOT
ONE BIT DID I BELIEVE HIM BUT I DARED NOT CONTRADICT DOCTORS ARE SO
SELF OPINIONATED SO IMMOVABLE IN THEIR DRY MATERIALIST VIEWS
ROSINE BROUGHT THE SHAWL AND I WAS BUNDLED INTO THE CARRIAGE
THE THEATRE WAS FULL CRAMMED TO ITS ROOF ROYAL AND NOBLE WERE THERE
PALACE AND HOTEL HAD EMPTIED THEIR INMATES INTO THOSE TIERS SO THRONGED
AND SO HUSHED
DEEPLY DID I FEEL MYSELF PRIVILEGED IN HAVING A PLACE
BEFORE THAT STAGE I LONGED TO SEE A BEING OF WHOSE POWERS I HAD HEARD
REPORTS WHICH MADE ME CONCEIVE PECULIAR ANTICIPATIONS
I WONDERED IF
SHE WOULD JUSTIFY HER RENOWN WITH STRANGE CURIOSITY WITH FEELINGS
SEVERE AND AUSTERE YET OF RIVETED INTEREST I WAITED
SHE WAS A STUDY
OF SUCH NATURE AS HAD NOT ENCOUNTERED MY EYES YET A GREAT AND NEW
PLANET SHE WAS BUT IN WHAT SHAPE I WAITED HER RISING
SHE ROSE AT NINE THAT DECEMBER NIGHT ABOVE THE HORIZON I SAW HER COME
SHE COULD SHINE YET WITH PALE GRANDEUR AND STEADY MIGHT BUT THAT STAR
VERGED ALREADY ON ITS JUDGMENT DAY
SEEN NEAR IT WAS A CHAOS HOLLOW
HALF CONSUMED AN ORB PERISHED OR PERISHING HALF LAVA HALF GLOW
I HAD HEARD THIS WOMAN TERMED PLAIN AND I EXPECTED BONY HARSHNESS
AND GRIMNESS SOMETHING LARGE ANGULAR SALLOW
WHAT I SAW WAS THE
SHADOW OF A ROYAL VASHTI A QUEEN FAIR AS THE DAY ONCE TURNED PALE
NOW LIKE TWILIGHT AND WASTED LIKE WAX IN FLAME
FOR AWHILE A LONG WHILE I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY A WOMAN THOUGH AN
UNIQUE WOMAN WHO MOVED IN MIGHT AND GRACE BEFORE THIS MULTITUDE
BY AND BY I RECOGNISED MY MISTAKE
BEHOLD I FOUND UPON HER SOMETHING
NEITHER OF WOMAN NOR OF MAN IN EACH OF HER EYES SAT A DEVIL
THESE
EVIL FORCES BORE HER THROUGH THE TRAGEDY KEPT UP HER FEEBLE
STRENGTH FOR SHE WAS BUT A FRAIL CREATURE AND AS THE ACTION ROSE AND
THE STIR DEEPENED HOW WILDLY THEY SHOOK HER WITH THEIR PASSIONS OF THE
PIT THEY WROTE HELL ON HER STRAIGHT HAUGHTY BROW
THEY TUNED HER
VOICE TO THE NOTE OF TORMENT
THEY WRITHED HER REGAL FACE TO A DEMONIAC
MASK
HATE AND MURDER AND MADNESS INCARNATE SHE STOOD
IT WAS A MARVELLOUS SIGHT A MIGHTY REVELATION
IT WAS A SPECTACLE LOW HORRIBLE IMMORAL
SWORDSMEN THRUST THROUGH AND DYING IN THEIR BLOOD ON THE ARENA SAND
BULLS GORING HORSES DISEMBOWELLED MADE A MEEKER VISION FOR THE
PUBLIC A MILDER CONDIMENT FOR A PEOPLE'S PALATE THAN VASHTI TORN BY
SEVEN DEVILS DEVILS WHICH CRIED SORE AND RENT THE TENEMENT THEY
HAUNTED BUT STILL REFUSED TO BE EXORCISED
SUFFERING HAD STRUCK THAT STAGE EMPRESS AND SHE STOOD BEFORE HER
AUDIENCE NEITHER YIELDING TO NOR ENDURING NOR IN FINITE MEASURE
RESENTING IT SHE STOOD LOCKED IN STRUGGLE RIGID IN RESISTANCE
SHE
STOOD NOT DRESSED BUT DRAPED IN PALE ANTIQUE FOLDS LONG AND REGULAR
LIKE SCULPTURE
A BACKGROUND AND ENTOURAGE AND FLOORING OF DEEPEST
CRIMSON THREW HER OUT WHITE LIKE ALABASTER LIKE SILVER RATHER BE IT
SAID LIKE DEATH
WHERE WAS THE ARTIST OF THE CLEOPATRA LET HIM COME AND SIT DOWN AND
STUDY THIS DIFFERENT VISION
LET HIM SEEK HERE THE MIGHTY BRAWN THE
MUSCLE THE ABOUNDING BLOOD THE FULL FED FLESH HE WORSHIPPED LET ALL
MATERIALISTS DRAW NIGH AND LOOK ON
I HAVE SAID THAT SHE DOES NOT RESENT HER GRIEF
NO THE WEAKNESS OF
THAT WORD WOULD MAKE IT A LIE
TO HER WHAT HURTS BECOMES IMMEDIATELY
EMBODIED SHE LOOKS ON IT AS A THING THAT CAN BE ATTACKED WORRIED
DOWN TORN IN SHREDS
SCARCELY A SUBSTANCE HERSELF SHE GRAPPLES TO
CONFLICT WITH ABSTRACTIONS
BEFORE CALAMITY SHE IS A TIGRESS SHE RENDS
HER WOES SHIVERS THEM IN CONVULSED ABHORRENCE
PAIN FOR HER HAS NO
RESULT IN GOOD TEARS WATER NO HARVEST OF WISDOM ON SICKNESS ON DEATH
ITSELF SHE LOOKS WITH THE EYE OF A REBEL
WICKED PERHAPS SHE IS BUT
ALSO SHE IS STRONG AND HER STRENGTH HAS CONQUERED BEAUTY HAS OVERCOME
GRACE AND BOUND BOTH AT HER SIDE CAPTIVES PEERLESSLY FAIR AND DOCILE
AS FAIR
EVEN IN THE UTTERMOST FRENZY OF ENERGY IS EACH MAENAD MOVEMENT
ROYALLY IMPERIALLY INCEDINGLY UPBORNE
HER HAIR FLYING LOOSE IN
REVEL OR WAR IS STILL AN ANGEL'S HAIR AND GLORIOUS UNDER A HALO
FALLEN INSURGENT BANISHED SHE REMEMBERS THE HEAVEN WHERE SHE
REBELLED
HEAVEN'S LIGHT FOLLOWING HER EXILE PIERCES ITS CONFINES
AND DISCLOSES THEIR FORLORN REMOTENESS
PLACE NOW THE CLEOPATRA OR ANY OTHER SLUG BEFORE HER AS AN OBSTACLE
AND SEE HER CUT THROUGH THE PULPY MASS AS THE SCIMITAR OF SALADIN CLOVE
THE DOWN CUSHION
LET PAUL PETER RUBENS WAKE FROM THE DEAD LET HIM
RISE OUT OF HIS CEREMENTS AND BRING INTO THIS PRESENCE ALL THE ARMY OF
HIS FAT WOMEN THE MAGIAN POWER OR PROPHET VIRTUE GIFTING THAT SLIGHT
ROD OF MOSES COULD AT ONE WAFT RELEASE AND RE MINGLE A SEA
SPELL PARTED WHELMING THE HEAVY HOST WITH THE DOWN RUSH OF OVERTHROWN
SEA RAMPARTS
VASHTI WAS NOT GOOD I WAS TOLD AND I HAVE SAID SHE DID NOT LOOK GOOD
THOUGH A SPIRIT SHE WAS A SPIRIT OUT OF TOPHET
WELL IF SO MUCH OF
UNHOLY FORCE CAN ARISE FROM BELOW MAY NOT AN EQUAL EFFLUX OF SACRED
ESSENCE DESCEND ONE DAY FROM ABOVE
WHAT THOUGHT DR
GRAHAM OF THIS BEING
FOR LONG INTERVALS I FORGOT TO LOOK HOW HE DEMEANED HIMSELF OR TO
QUESTION WHAT HE THOUGHT
THE STRONG MAGNETISM OF GENIUS DREW MY HEART
OUT OF ITS WONTED ORBIT THE SUNFLOWER TURNED FROM THE SOUTH TO A
FIERCE LIGHT NOT SOLAR A RUSHING RED COMETARY LIGHT HOT ON VISION
AND TO SENSATION
I HAD SEEN ACTING BEFORE BUT NEVER ANYTHING LIKE
THIS NEVER ANYTHING WHICH ASTONISHED HOPE AND HUSHED DESIRE WHICH
OUTSTRIPPED IMPULSE AND PALED CONCEPTION WHICH INSTEAD OF MERELY
IRRITATING IMAGINATION WITH THE THOUGHT OF WHAT MIGHT BE DONE AT THE
SAME TIME FEVERING THE NERVES BECAUSE IT WAS NOT DONE DISCLOSED
POWER LIKE A DEEP SWOLLEN WINTER RIVER THUNDERING IN CATARACT AND
BEARING THE SOUL LIKE A LEAF ON THE STEEP AND STEELLY SWEEP OF ITS
DESCENT
MISS FANSHAWE WITH HER USUAL RIPENESS OF JUDGMENT PRONOUNCED DR
BRETTON A SERIOUS IMPASSIONED MAN TOO GRAVE AND TOO IMPRESSIBLE
NOT
IN SUCH LIGHT DID I EVER SEE HIM NO SUCH FAULTS COULD I LAY TO HIS
CHARGE
HIS NATURAL ATTITUDE WAS NOT THE MEDITATIVE NOR HIS NATURAL
MOOD THE SENTIMENTAL IMPRESSIONABLE HE WAS AS DIMPLING WATER BUT
ALMOST AS WATER UNIMPRESSIBLE THE BREEZE THE SUN MOVED HIM METAL
COULD NOT GRAVE NOR FIRE BRAND
DR
JOHN COULD THINK AND THINK WELL BUT HE WAS RATHER A MAN OF
ACTION THAN OF THOUGHT HE COULD FEEL AND FEEL VIVIDLY IN HIS WAY
BUT HIS HEART HAD NO CHORD FOR ENTHUSIASM TO BRIGHT SOFT SWEET
INFLUENCES HIS EYES AND LIPS GAVE BRIGHT SOFT SWEET WELCOME
BEAUTIFUL TO SEE AS DYES OF ROSE AND SILVER PEARL AND PURPLE IMBUING
SUMMER CLOUDS FOR WHAT BELONGED TO STORM WHAT WAS WILD AND INTENSE
DANGEROUS SUDDEN AND FLAMING HE HAD NO SYMPATHY AND HELD WITH IT NO
COMMUNION
WHEN I TOOK TIME AND REGAINED INCLINATION TO GLANCE AT HIM
IT AMUSED AND ENLIGHTENED ME TO DISCOVER THAT HE WAS WATCHING THAT
SINISTER AND SOVEREIGN VASHTI NOT WITH WONDER NOR WORSHIP NOR YET
DISMAY BUT SIMPLY WITH INTENSE CURIOSITY
HER AGONY DID NOT PAIN HIM
HER WILD MOAN WORSE THAN A SHRIEK DID NOT MUCH MOVE HIM HER FURY
REVOLTED HIM SOMEWHAT BUT NOT TO THE POINT OF HORROR
COOL YOUNG
BRITON THE PALE CLIFFS OF HIS OWN ENGLAND DO NOT LOOK DOWN ON THE
TIDES OF THE CHANNEL MORE CALMLY THAN HE WATCHED THE PYTHIAN
INSPIRATION OF THAT NIGHT
LOOKING AT HIS FACE I LONGED TO KNOW HIS EXACT OPINIONS AND AT LAST I
PUT A QUESTION TENDING TO ELICIT THEM
AT THE SOUND OF MY VOICE HE
AWOKE AS IF OUT OF A DREAM FOR HE HAD BEEN THINKING AND VERY INTENTLY
THINKING HIS OWN THOUGHTS AFTER HIS OWN MANNER
HOW DID HE LIKE
VASHTI I WISHED TO KNOW
HM M M WAS THE FIRST SCARCE ARTICULATE BUT EXPRESSIVE ANSWER AND
THEN SUCH A STRANGE SMILE WENT WANDERING ROUND HIS LIPS A SMILE SO
CRITICAL SO ALMOST CALLOUS I SUPPOSE THAT FOR NATURES OF THAT ORDER
HIS SYMPATHIES WERE CALLOUS
IN A FEW TERSE PHRASES HE TOLD ME HIS
OPINION OF AND FEELING TOWARDS THE ACTRESS HE JUDGED HER AS A WOMAN
NOT AN ARTIST IT WAS A BRANDING JUDGMENT
THAT NIGHT WAS ALREADY MARKED IN MY BOOK OF LIFE NOT WITH WHITE BUT
WITH A DEEP RED CROSS
BUT I HAD NOT DONE WITH IT YET AND OTHER
MEMORANDA WERE DESTINED TO BE SET DOWN IN CHARACTERS OF TINT INDELIBLE
TOWARDS MIDNIGHT WHEN THE DEEPENING TRAGEDY BLACKENED TO THE
DEATH SCENE AND ALL HELD THEIR BREATH AND EVEN GRAHAM BIT HIS
UNDER LIP AND KNIT HIS BROW AND SAT STILL AND STRUCK WHEN THE WHOLE
THEATRE WAS HUSHED WHEN THE VISION OF ALL EYES CENTRED IN ONE POINT
WHEN ALL EARS LISTENED TOWARDS ONE QUARTER NOTHING BEING SEEN BUT THE
WHITE FORM SUNK ON A SEAT QUIVERING IN CONFLICT WITH HER LAST HER
WORST HATED HER VISIBLY CONQUERING FOE NOTHING HEARD BUT HER THROES
HER GASPINGS BREATHING YET OF MUTINY PANTING STILL DEFIANCE WHEN AS
IT SEEMED AN INORDINATE WILL CONVULSING A PERISHING MORTAL FRAME
BENT IT TO BATTLE WITH DOOM AND DEATH FOUGHT EVERY INCH OF GROUND
SOLD EVERY DROP OF BLOOD RESISTED TO THE LATEST THE RAPE OF EVERY
FACULTY WOULD SEE WOULD HEAR WOULD BREATHE WOULD LIVE UP
TO WITHIN WELL NIGH BEYOND THE MOMENT WHEN DEATH SAYS TO ALL SENSE
AND ALL BEING THUS FAR AND NO FARTHER
JUST THEN A STIR PREGNANT WITH OMEN RUSTLED BEHIND THE SCENES FEET
RAN VOICES SPOKE
WHAT WAS IT DEMANDED THE WHOLE HOUSE
A FLAME A
SMELL OF SMOKE REPLIED
FIRE RANG THROUGH THE GALLERY
FIRE WAS REPEATED RE ECHOED
YELLED FORTH AND THEN AND FASTER THAN PEN CAN SET IT DOWN CAME
PANIC RUSHING CRUSHING A BLIND SELFISH CRUEL CHAOS
AND DR
JOHN READER I SEE HIM YET WITH HIS LOOK OF COMELY COURAGE
AND CORDIAL CALM
LUCY WILL SIT STILL I KNOW SAID HE GLANCING DOWN AT ME WITH THE
SAME SERENE GOODNESS THE SAME REPOSE OF FIRMNESS THAT I HAVE SEEN IN
HIM WHEN SITTING AT HIS SIDE AMID THE SECURE PEACE OF HIS MOTHER'S
HEARTH
YES THUS ADJURED I THINK I WOULD HAVE SAT STILL UNDER A
ROCKING CRAG BUT INDEED TO SIT STILL IN ACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES WAS MY
INSTINCT AND AT THE PRICE OF MY VERY LIFE I WOULD NOT HAVE MOVED TO
GIVE HIM TROUBLE THWART HIS WILL OR MAKE DEMANDS ON HIS ATTENTION
WE
WERE IN THE STALLS AND FOR A FEW MINUTES THERE WAS A MOST TERRIBLE
RUTHLESS PRESSURE ABOUT US
HOW TERRIFIED ARE THE WOMEN SAID HE BUT IF THE MEN WERE NOT ALMOST
EQUALLY SO ORDER MIGHT BE MAINTAINED
THIS IS A SORRY SCENE I SEE
FIFTY SELFISH BRUTES AT THIS MOMENT EACH OF WHOM IF I WERE NEAR I
COULD CONSCIENTIOUSLY KNOCK DOWN
I SEE SOME WOMEN BRAVER THAN SOME
MEN
THERE IS ONE YONDER GOOD GOD
WHILE GRAHAM WAS SPEAKING A YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD BEEN VERY QUIETLY AND
STEADILY CLINGING TO A GENTLEMAN BEFORE US WAS SUDDENLY STRUCK FROM
HER PROTECTOR'S ARMS BY A BIG BUTCHERLY INTRUDER AND HURLED UNDER THE
FEET OF THE CROWD
SCARCE TWO SECONDS LASTED HER DISAPPEARANCE
GRAHAM
RUSHED FORWARDS HE AND THE GENTLEMAN A POWERFUL MAN THOUGH
GREY HAIRED UNITED THEIR STRENGTH TO THRUST BACK THE THRONG HER HEAD
AND LONG HAIR FELL BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER SHE SEEMED UNCONSCIOUS
TRUST HER WITH ME I AM A MEDICAL MAN SAID DR
JOHN
IF YOU HAVE NO LADY WITH YOU BE IT SO WAS THE ANSWER
HOLD HER
AND I WILL FORCE A PASSAGE WE MUST GET HER TO THE AIR
I HAVE A LADY SAID GRAHAM BUT SHE WILL BE NEITHER HINDRANCE NOR
INCUMBRANCE
HE SUMMONED ME WITH HIS EYE WE WERE SEPARATED
RESOLUTE HOWEVER TO
REJOIN HIM I PENETRATED THE LIVING BARRIER CREEPING UNDER WHERE I
COULD NOT GET BETWEEN OR OVER
FASTEN ON ME AND DON'T LEAVE GO HE SAID AND I OBEYED HIM
OUR PIONEER PROVED STRONG AND ADROIT HE OPENED THE DENSE MASS LIKE A
WEDGE WITH PATIENCE AND TOIL HE AT LAST BORED THROUGH THE
FLESH AND BLOOD ROCK SO SOLID HOT AND SUFFOCATING AND BROUGHT US TO
THE FRESH FREEZING NIGHT
YOU ARE AN ENGLISHMAN SAID HE TURNING SHORTLY ON DR
BRETTON WHEN
WE GOT INTO THE STREET
AN ENGLISHMAN
AND I SPEAK TO A COUNTRYMAN WAS THE REPLY
RIGHT
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO STAND HERE TWO MINUTES WHILST I FIND MY
CARRIAGE
PAPA I AM NOT HURT SAID A GIRLISH VOICE AM I WITH PAPA
YOU ARE WITH A FRIEND AND YOUR FATHER IS CLOSE AT HAND
TELL HIM I AM NOT HURT EXCEPT JUST IN MY SHOULDER
OH MY SHOULDER
THEY TROD JUST HERE
DISLOCATION PERHAPS MUTTERED THE DOCTOR LET US HOPE THERE IS NO
WORSE INJURY DONE
LUCY LEND A HAND ONE INSTANT
AND I ASSISTED WHILE HE MADE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF DRAPERY AND POSITION
FOR THE EASE OF HIS SUFFERING BURDEN
SHE SUPPRESSED A MOAN AND LAY IN
HIS ARMS QUIETLY AND PATIENTLY
SHE IS VERY LIGHT SAID GRAHAM LIKE A CHILD AND HE ASKED IN MY
EAR IS SHE A CHILD LUCY DID YOU NOTICE HER AGE
I AM NOT A CHILD I AM A PERSON OF SEVENTEEN RESPONDED THE PATIENT
DEMURELY AND WITH DIGNITY
THEN DIRECTLY AFTER TELL PAPA TO COME I
GET ANXIOUS
THE CARRIAGE DROVE UP HER FATHER RELIEVED GRAHAM BUT IN THE EXCHANGE
FROM ONE BEARER TO ANOTHER SHE WAS HURT AND MOANED AGAIN
MY DARLING SAID THE FATHER TENDERLY THEN TURNING TO GRAHAM YOU
SAID SIR YOU ARE A MEDICAL MAN
I AM DR
BRETTON OF LA TERRASSE
GOOD
WILL YOU STEP INTO MY CARRIAGE
MY OWN CARRIAGE IS HERE I WILL SEEK IT AND ACCOMPANY YOU
BE PLEASED THEN TO FOLLOW US AND HE NAMED HIS ADDRESS THE HTEL
CRCY IN THE RUE CRCY
WE FOLLOWED THE CARRIAGE DROVE FAST MYSELF AND GRAHAM WERE SILENT
THIS SEEMED LIKE AN ADVENTURE
SOME LITTLE TIME BEING LOST IN SEEKING OUR OWN EQUIPAGE WE REACHED THE
HOTEL PERHAPS ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER THESE STRANGERS
IT WAS AN HOTEL
IN THE FOREIGN SENSE A COLLECTION OF DWELLING HOUSES NOT AN INN A
VAST LOFTY PILE WITH A HUGE ARCH TO ITS STREET DOOR LEADING THROUGH
A VAULTED COVERED WAY INTO A SQUARE ALL BUILT ROUND
WE ALIGHTED PASSED UP A WIDE HANDSOME PUBLIC STAIRCASE AND STOPPED
AT NUMRO 2 ON THE SECOND LANDING THE FIRST FLOOR COMPRISING THE ABODE
OF I KNOW NOT WHAT PRINCE RUSSE AS GRAHAM INFORMED ME
ON RINGING
THE BELL AT A SECOND GREAT DOOR WE WERE ADMITTED TO A SUITE OF VERY
HANDSOME APARTMENTS
ANNOUNCED BY A SERVANT IN LIVERY WE ENTERED A
DRAWING ROOM WHOSE HEARTH GLOWED WITH AN ENGLISH FIRE AND WHOSE WALLS
GLEAMED WITH FOREIGN MIRRORS
NEAR THE HEARTH APPEARED A LITTLE GROUP
A SLIGHT FORM SUNK IN A DEEP ARM CHAIR ONE OR TWO WOMEN BUSY ABOUT IT
THE IRON GREY GENTLEMAN ANXIOUSLY LOOKING ON
WHERE IS HARRIET I WISH HARRIET WOULD COME TO ME SAID THE GIRLISH
VOICE FAINTLY
WHERE IS MRS
HURST DEMANDED THE GENTLEMAN IMPATIENTLY AND SOMEWHAT
STERNLY OF THE MAN SERVANT WHO HAD ADMITTED US
I AM SORRY TO SAY SHE IS GONE OUT OF TOWN SIR MY YOUNG LADY GAVE HER
LEAVE TILL TO MORROW
YES I DID I DID
SHE IS GONE TO SEE HER SISTER I SAID SHE MIGHT GO
I REMEMBER NOW INTERPOSED THE YOUNG LADY BUT I AM SO SORRY FOR
MANON AND LOUISON CANNOT UNDERSTAND A WORD I SAY AND THEY HURT ME
WITHOUT MEANING TO DO SO
DR
JOHN AND THE GENTLEMAN NOW INTERCHANGED GREETINGS AND WHILE THEY
PASSED A FEW MINUTES IN CONSULTATION I APPROACHED THE EASY CHAIR AND
SEEING WHAT THE FAINT AND SINKING GIRL WISHED TO HAVE DONE I DID IT
FOR HER
I WAS STILL OCCUPIED IN THE ARRANGEMENT WHEN GRAHAM DREW NEAR HE WAS
NO LESS SKILLED IN SURGERY THAN MEDICINE AND ON EXAMINATION FOUND
THAT NO FURTHER ADVICE THAN HIS OWN WAS NECESSARY TO THE TREATMENT OF
THE PRESENT CASE
HE ORDERED HER TO BE CARRIED TO HER CHAMBER AND
WHISPERED TO ME GO WITH THE WOMEN LUCY THEY SEEM BUT DULL YOU CAN
AT LEAST DIRECT THEIR MOVEMENTS AND THUS SPARE HER SOME PAIN
SHE MUST
BE TOUCHED VERY TENDERLY
THE CHAMBER WAS A ROOM SHADOWY WITH PALE BLUE HANGINGS VAPOROUS WITH
CURTAININGS AND VEILINGS OF MUSLIN THE BED SEEMED TO ME LIKE
SNOW DRIFT AND MIST SPOTLESS SOFT AND GAUZY
MAKING THE WOMEN STAND
APART I UNDRESSED THEIR MISTRESS WITHOUT THEIR WELL MEANING BUT
CLUMSY AID
I WAS NOT IN A SUFFICIENTLY COLLECTED MOOD TO NOTE WITH
SEPARATE DISTINCTNESS EVERY DETAIL OF THE ATTIRE I REMOVED BUT I
RECEIVED A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF REFINEMENT DELICACY AND PERFECT
PERSONAL CULTIVATION WHICH IN A PERIOD OF AFTER THOUGHT OFFERED IN
MY REFLECTIONS A SINGULAR CONTRAST TO NOTES RETAINED OF MISS GINEVRA
FANSHAWE'S APPOINTMENTS
THE GIRL WAS HERSELF A SMALL DELICATE CREATURE BUT MADE LIKE A MODEL
AS I FOLDED BACK HER PLENTIFUL YET FINE HAIR SO SHINING AND SOFT AND
SO EXQUISITELY TENDED I HAD UNDER MY OBSERVATION A YOUNG PALE WEARY
BUT HIGH BRED FACE
THE BROW WAS SMOOTH AND CLEAR THE EYEBROWS WERE
DISTINCT BUT SOFT AND MELTING TO A MERE TRACE AT THE TEMPLES THE
EYES WERE A RICH GIFT OF NATURE FINE AND FULL LARGE DEEP SEEMING TO
HOLD DOMINION OVER THE SLIGHTER SUBORDINATE FEATURES CAPABLE
PROBABLY OF MUCH SIGNIFICANCE AT ANOTHER HOUR AND UNDER OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES THAN THE PRESENT BUT NOW LANGUID AND SUFFERING
HER SKIN
WAS PERFECTLY FAIR THE NECK AND HANDS VEINED FINELY LIKE THE PETALS OF
A FLOWER A THIN GLAZING OF THE ICE OF PRIDE POLISHED THIS DELICATE
EXTERIOR AND HER LIP WORE A CURL I DOUBT NOT INHERENT AND
UNCONSCIOUS BUT WHICH IF I HAD SEEN IT FIRST WITH THE ACCOMPANIMENTS
OF HEALTH AND STATE WOULD HAVE STRUCK ME AS UNWARRANTED AND PROVING
IN THE LITTLE LADY A QUITE MISTAKEN VIEW OF LIFE AND HER OWN
CONSEQUENCE
HER DEMEANOUR UNDER THE DOCTOR'S HANDS AT FIRST EXCITED A SMILE IT WAS
NOT PUERILE RATHER ON THE WHOLE PATIENT AND FIRM BUT YET ONCE OR
TWICE SHE ADDRESSED HIM WITH SUDDENNESS AND SHARPNESS SAYING THAT HE
HURT HER AND MUST CONTRIVE TO GIVE HER LESS PAIN I SAW HER LARGE
EYES TOO SETTLE ON HIS FACE LIKE THE SOLEMN EYES OF SOME PRETTY
WONDERING CHILD
I KNOW NOT WHETHER GRAHAM FELT THIS EXAMINATION IF HE
DID HE WAS CAUTIOUS NOT TO CHECK OR DISCOMFORT IT BY ANY RETALIATORY
LOOK
I THINK HE PERFORMED HIS WORK WITH EXTREME CARE AND GENTLENESS
SPARING HER WHAT PAIN HE COULD AND SHE ACKNOWLEDGED AS MUCH WHEN HE
HAD DONE BY THE WORDS THANK YOU DOCTOR AND GOOD NIGHT VERY
GRATEFULLY PRONOUNCED AS SHE UTTERED THEM HOWEVER IT WAS WITH A
REPETITION OF THE SERIOUS DIRECT GAZE I THOUGHT PECULIAR IN ITS
GRAVITY AND INTENTNESS
THE INJURIES IT SEEMS WERE NOT DANGEROUS AN ASSURANCE WHICH HER
FATHER RECEIVED WITH A SMILE THAT ALMOST MADE ONE HIS FRIEND IT WAS SO
GLAD AND GRATIFIED
HE NOW EXPRESSED HIS OBLIGATIONS TO GRAHAM WITH AS
MUCH EARNESTNESS AS WAS BEFITTING AN ENGLISHMAN ADDRESSING ONE WHO HAS
SERVED HIM BUT IS YET A STRANGER HE ALSO BEGGED HIM TO CALL THE NEXT
DAY
PAPA SAID A VOICE FROM THE VEILED COUCH THANK THE LADY TOO IS
SHE THERE
I OPENED THE CURTAIN WITH A SMILE AND LOOKED IN AT HER
SHE LAY NOW AT
COMPARATIVE EASE SHE LOOKED PRETTY THOUGH PALE HER FACE WAS
DELICATELY DESIGNED AND IF AT FIRST SIGHT IT APPEARED PROUD I BELIEVE
CUSTOM MIGHT PROVE IT TO BE SOFT
I THANK THE LADY VERY SINCERELY SAID HER FATHER I FANCY SHE HAS
BEEN VERY GOOD TO MY CHILD
I THINK WE SCARCELY DARE TELL MRS
HURST
WHO HAS BEEN HER SUBSTITUTE AND DONE HER WORK SHE WILL FEEL AT ONCE
ASHAMED AND JEALOUS
AND THUS IN THE MOST FRIENDLY SPIRIT PARTING GREETINGS WERE
INTERCHANGED AND REFRESHMENT HAVING BEEN HOSPITABLY OFFERED BUT BY
US AS IT WAS LATE REFUSED WE WITHDREW FROM THE HTEL CRCY
ON OUR WAY BACK WE REPASSED THE THEATRE
ALL WAS SILENCE AND DARKNESS
THE ROARING RUSHING CROWD ALL VANISHED AND GONE THE DAMPS AS WELL AS
THE INCIPIENT FIRE EXTINCT AND FORGOTTEN
NEXT MORNING'S PAPERS
EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS BUT SOME LOOSE DRAPERY ON WHICH A SPARK HAD
FALLEN AND WHICH HAD BLAZED UP AND BEEN QUENCHED IN A MOMENT
CHAPTER XXIV
M
DE BASSOMPIERRE
THOSE WHO LIVE IN RETIREMENT WHOSE LIVES HAVE FALLEN AMID THE
SECLUSION OF SCHOOLS OR OF OTHER WALLED IN AND GUARDED DWELLINGS ARE
LIABLE TO BE SUDDENLY AND FOR A LONG WHILE DROPPED OUT OF THE MEMORY OF
THEIR FRIENDS THE DENIZENS OF A FREER WORLD
UNACCOUNTABLY PERHAPS
AND CLOSE UPON SOME SPACE OF UNUSUALLY FREQUENT INTERCOURSE SOME
CONGERIES OF RATHER EXCITING LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES WHOSE NATURAL SEQUEL
WOULD RATHER SEEM TO BE THE QUICKENING THAN THE SUSPENSION OF
COMMUNICATION THERE FALLS A STILLY PAUSE A WORDLESS SILENCE A LONG
BLANK OF OBLIVION
UNBROKEN ALWAYS IS THIS BLANK ALIKE ENTIRE AND
UNEXPLAINED
THE LETTER THE MESSAGE ONCE FREQUENT ARE CUT OFF THE
VISIT FORMERLY PERIODICAL CEASES TO OCCUR THE BOOK PAPER OR OTHER
TOKEN THAT INDICATED REMEMBRANCE COMES NO MORE
ALWAYS THERE ARE EXCELLENT REASONS FOR THESE LAPSES IF THE HERMIT BUT
KNEW THEM
THOUGH HE IS STAGNANT IN HIS CELL HIS CONNECTIONS WITHOUT
ARE WHIRLING IN THE VERY VORTEX OF LIFE
THAT VOID INTERVAL WHICH
PASSES FOR HIM SO SLOWLY THAT THE VERY CLOCKS SEEM AT A STAND AND THE
WINGLESS HOURS PLOD BY IN THE LIKENESS OF TIRED TRAMPS PRONE TO REST AT
MILESTONES THAT SAME INTERVAL PERHAPS TEEMS WITH EVENTS AND PANTS
WITH HURRY FOR HIS FRIENDS
THE HERMIT IF HE BE A SENSIBLE HERMIT WILL SWALLOW HIS OWN THOUGHTS
AND LOCK UP HIS OWN EMOTIONS DURING THESE WEEKS OF INWARD WINTER
HE
WILL KNOW THAT DESTINY DESIGNED HIM TO IMITATE ON OCCASION THE
DORMOUSE AND HE WILL BE CONFORMABLE MAKE A TIDY BALL OF HIMSELF
CREEP INTO A HOLE OF LIFE'S WALL AND SUBMIT DECENTLY TO THE DRIFT
WHICH BLOWS IN AND SOON BLOCKS HIM UP PRESERVING HIM IN ICE FOR THE
SEASON
LET HIM SAY IT IS QUITE RIGHT IT OUGHT TO BE SO SINCE SO IT IS
AND PERHAPS ONE DAY HIS SNOW SEPULCHRE WILL OPEN SPRING'S SOFTNESS
WILL RETURN THE SUN AND SOUTH WIND WILL REACH HIM THE BUDDING OF
HEDGES AND CAROLLING OF BIRDS AND SINGING OF LIBERATED STREAMS WILL
CALL HIM TO KINDLY RESURRECTION
PERHAPS THIS MAY BE THE CASE
PERHAPS NOT THE FROST MAY GET INTO HIS HEART AND NEVER THAW MORE WHEN
SPRING COMES A CROW OR A PIE MAY PICK OUT OF THE WALL ONLY HIS
DORMOUSE BONES
WELL EVEN IN THAT CASE ALL WILL BE RIGHT IT IS TO BE
SUPPOSED HE KNEW FROM THE FIRST HE WAS MORTAL AND MUST ONE DAY GO THE
WAY OF ALL FLESH AS WELL SOON AS SYNE
FOLLOWING THAT EVENTFUL EVENING AT THE THEATRE CAME FOR ME SEVEN WEEKS
AS BARE AS SEVEN SHEETS OF BLANK PAPER NO WORD WAS WRITTEN ON ONE OF
THEM NOT A VISIT NOT A TOKEN
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THAT TIME I ENTERTAINED FANCIES THAT SOMETHING HAD
HAPPENED TO MY FRIENDS AT LA TERRASSE
THE MID BLANK IS ALWAYS A
BECLOUDED POINT FOR THE SOLITARY HIS NERVES ACHE WITH THE STRAIN OF
LONG EXPECTANCY THE DOUBTS HITHERTO REPELLED GATHER NOW TO A MASS
AND STRONG IN ACCUMULATION ROLL BACK UPON HIM WITH A FORCE WHICH
SAVOURS OF VINDICTIVENESS
NIGHT TOO BECOMES AN UNKINDLY TIME AND
SLEEP AND HIS NATURE CANNOT AGREE STRANGE STARTS AND STRUGGLES HARASS
HIS COUCH THE SINISTER BAND OF BAD DREAMS WITH HORROR OF CALAMITY
AND SICK DREAD OF ENTIRE DESERTION AT THEIR HEAD JOIN THE LEAGUE
AGAINST HIM
POOR WRETCH HE DOES HIS BEST TO BEAR UP BUT HE IS A
POOR PALLID WASTING WRETCH DESPITE THAT BEST
TOWARDS THE LAST OF THESE LONG SEVEN WEEKS I ADMITTED WHAT THROUGH THE
OTHER SIX I HAD JEALOUSLY EXCLUDED THE CONVICTION THAT THESE BLANKS
WERE INEVITABLE THE RESULT OF CIRCUMSTANCES THE FIAT OF FATE A PART
OF MY LIFE'S LOT AND ABOVE ALL A MATTER ABOUT WHOSE ORIGIN NO
QUESTION MUST EVER BE ASKED FOR WHOSE PAINFUL SEQUENCE NO MURMUR EVER
UTTERED
OF COURSE I DID NOT BLAME MYSELF FOR SUFFERING I THANK GOD I
HAD A TRUER SENSE OF JUSTICE THAN TO FALL INTO ANY IMBECILE
EXTRAVAGANCE OF SELF ACCUSATION AND AS TO BLAMING OTHERS FOR SILENCE
IN MY REASON I WELL KNEW THEM BLAMELESS AND IN MY HEART ACKNOWLEDGED
THEM SO BUT IT WAS A ROUGH AND HEAVY ROAD TO TRAVEL AND I LONGED FOR
BETTER DAYS
I TRIED DIFFERENT EXPEDIENTS TO SUSTAIN AND FILL EXISTENCE I COMMENCED
AN ELABORATE PIECE OF LACE WORK I STUDIED GERMAN PRETTY HARD I
UNDERTOOK A COURSE OF REGULAR READING OF THE DRIEST AND THICKEST BOOKS
IN THE LIBRARY IN ALL MY EFFORTS I WAS AS ORTHODOX AS I KNEW HOW TO
BE
WAS THERE ERROR SOMEWHERE VERY LIKELY
I ONLY KNOW THE RESULT WAS
AS IF I HAD GNAWED A FILE TO SATISFY HUNGER OR DRANK BRINE TO QUENCH
THIRST
MY HOUR OF TORMENT WAS THE POST HOUR
UNFORTUNATELY I KNEW IT TOO
WELL AND TRIED AS VAINLY AS ASSIDUOUSLY TO CHEAT MYSELF OF THAT
KNOWLEDGE DREADING THE RACK OF EXPECTATION AND THE SICK COLLAPSE OF
DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH DAILY PRECEDED AND FOLLOWED UPON THAT
WELL RECOGNISED RING
I SUPPOSE ANIMALS KEPT IN CAGES AND SO SCANTILY FED AS TO BE ALWAYS
UPON THE VERGE OF FAMINE AWAIT THEIR FOOD AS I AWAITED A LETTER
OH TO SPEAK TRUTH AND DROP THAT TONE OF A FALSE CALM WHICH LONG TO
SUSTAIN OUTWEARS NATURE'S ENDURANCE I UNDERWENT IN THOSE SEVEN WEEKS
BITTER FEARS AND PAINS STRANGE INWARD TRIALS MISERABLE DEFECTIONS OF
HOPE INTOLERABLE ENCROACHMENTS OF DESPAIR
THIS LAST CAME SO NEAR ME
SOMETIMES THAT HER BREATH WENT RIGHT THROUGH ME
I USED TO FEEL IT LIKE
A BALEFUL AIR OR SIGH PENETRATE DEEP AND MAKE MOTION PAUSE AT MY
HEART OR PROCEED ONLY UNDER UNSPEAKABLE OPPRESSION
THE LETTER THE
WELL BELOVED LETTER WOULD NOT COME AND IT WAS ALL OF SWEETNESS IN
LIFE I HAD TO LOOK FOR
IN THE VERY EXTREMITY OF WANT I HAD RECOURSE AGAIN AND YET AGAIN TO
THE LITTLE PACKET IN THE CASE THE FIVE LETTERS
HOW SPLENDID THAT
MONTH SEEMED WHOSE SKIES HAD BEHELD THE RISING OF THESE FIVE STARS IT
WAS ALWAYS AT NIGHT I VISITED THEM AND NOT DARING TO ASK EVERY EVENING
FOR A CANDLE IN THE KITCHEN I BOUGHT A WAX TAPER AND MATCHES TO LIGHT
IT AND AT THE STUDY HOUR STOLE UP TO THE DORMITORY AND FEASTED ON MY
CRUST FROM THE BARMECIDE'S LOAF
IT DID NOT NOURISH ME I PINED ON IT
AND GOT AS THIN AS A SHADOW OTHERWISE I WAS NOT ILL
READING THERE SOMEWHAT LATE ONE EVENING AND FEELING THAT THE POWER TO
READ WAS LEAVING ME FOR THE LETTERS FROM INCESSANT PERUSAL WERE LOSING
ALL SAP AND SIGNIFICANCE MY GOLD WAS WITHERING TO LEAVES BEFORE MY
EYES AND I WAS SORROWING OVER THE DISILLUSION SUDDENLY A QUICK
TRIPPING FOOT RAN UP THE STAIRS
I KNEW GINEVRA FANSHAWE'S STEP SHE
HAD DINED IN TOWN THAT AFTERNOON SHE WAS NOW RETURNED AND WOULD COME
HERE TO REPLACE HER SHAWL C
IN THE WARDROBE
YES IN SHE CAME DRESSED IN BRIGHT SILK WITH HER SHAWL FALLING FROM
HER SHOULDERS AND HER CURLS HALF UNCURLED IN THE DAMP OF NIGHT
DROOPING CARELESS AND HEAVY UPON HER NECK
I HAD HARDLY TIME TO
RECASKET MY TREASURES AND LOCK THEM UP WHEN SHE WAS AT MY SIDE HER
HUMOUR SEEMED NONE OF THE BEST
IT HAS BEEN A STUPID EVENING THEY ARE STUPID PEOPLE SHE BEGAN
WHO MRS
CHOLMONDELEY I THOUGHT YOU ALWAYS FOUND HER HOUSE CHARMING

DON'T I KNOW WHAT MAMMA SAYS ABOUT HIM HE IS NOT MY OWN UNCLE BUT

MAMMA DETESTS HIM SHE SAYS HE KILLED AUNT
GINEVRA WITH UNKINDNESS HE LOOKS LIKE A BEAR
SUCH A DISMAL EVENING
SHE WENT ON
I'LL GO NO MORE TO HIS BIG HOTEL
FANCY ME WALKING INTO A
ROOM ALONE AND A GREAT MAN FIFTY YEARS OLD COMING FORWARDS AND AFTER
A FEW MINUTES' CONVERSATION ACTUALLY TURNING HIS BACK UPON ME AND THEN
ABRUPTLY GOING OUT OF THE ROOM
SUCH ODD WAYS I DARESAY HIS CONSCIENCE
SMOTE HIM FOR THEY ALL SAY AT HOME I AM THE PICTURE OF AUNT GINEVRA
MAMMA OFTEN DECLARES THE LIKENESS IS QUITE RIDICULOUS

OCCASION OF HER ACCIDENT ACCIDENT BAH ALL AFFECTATION I DON'T THINK

DR

DE BASSOMPIERRE'S THIS EVENING
AY AY AS LARGE AS LIFE AND MISSY PLAYED THE HOSTESS
WHAT A
CONCEITED DOLL IT IS
SOURED AND LISTLESS MISS FANSHAWE WAS BEGINNING TO DISCLOSE THE CAUSES
OF HER PROSTRATE CONDITION
THERE HAD BEEN A RETRENCHMENT OF INCENSE A
DIVERSION OR A TOTAL WITHHOLDING OF HOMAGE AND ATTENTION COQUETRY HAD
FAILED OF EFFECT VANITY HAD UNDERGONE MORTIFICATION
SHE LAY FUMING IN
THE VAPOURS
IS MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE QUITE WELL NOW I ASKED
AS WELL AS YOU OR I NO DOUBT BUT SHE IS AN AFFECTED LITTLE THING
AND GAVE HERSELF INVALID AIRS TO ATTRACT MEDICAL NOTICE
AND TO SEE THE
OLD DOWAGER MAKING HER RECLINE ON A COUCH AND 'MY SON JOHN'
PROHIBITING EXCITEMENT ETCETERA FAUGH THE SCENE WAS QUITE SICKENING
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO IF THE OBJECT OF ATTENTION HAD BEEN CHANGED

BRETTON'S

NOW SPUN OFF THE DISTAFF I PEREMPTORILY DESIRE YOU TO RISE FROM THAT
BED AND VACATE THIS ROOM
PASSIONATE THING YOUR FACE IS THE COLOUR OF A COQUELICOT
I WONDER
WHAT ALWAYS MAKES YOU SO MIGHTY TESTY L'ENDROIT DU GROS JEAN 'JOHN
ANDERSON MY JOE JOHN OH THE DISTINGUISHED NAME
THRILLING WITH EXASPERATION TO WHICH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHEER FOLLY TO
HAVE GIVEN VENT FOR THERE WAS NO CONTENDING WITH THAT UNSUBSTANTIAL
FEATHER THAT MEALY WINGED MOTH I EXTINGUISHED MY TAPER LOCKED MY
BUREAU AND LEFT HER SINCE SHE WOULD NOT LEAVE ME
SMALL BEER AS SHE
WAS SHE HAD TURNED INSUFFERABLY ACID
THE MORROW WAS THURSDAY AND A HALF HOLIDAY
BREAKFAST WAS OVER I HAD
WITHDRAWN TO THE FIRST CLASSE
THE DREADED HOUR THE POST HOUR WAS
NEARING AND I SAT WAITING IT MUCH AS A GHOST SEER MIGHT WAIT HIS
SPECTRE
LESS THAN EVER WAS A LETTER PROBABLE STILL STRIVE AS I
WOULD I COULD NOT FORGET THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE
AS THE MOMENTS
LESSENED A RESTLESSNESS AND FEAR ALMOST BEYOND THE AVERAGE ASSAILED
ME
IT WAS A DAY OF WINTER EAST WIND AND I HAD NOW FOR SOME TIME
ENTERED INTO THAT DREARY FELLOWSHIP WITH THE WINDS AND THEIR CHANGES
SO LITTLE KNOWN SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO THE HEALTHY
THE NORTH AND EAST
OWNED A TERRIFIC INFLUENCE MAKING ALL PAIN MORE POIGNANT ALL SORROW
SADDER
THE SOUTH COULD CALM THE WEST SOMETIMES CHEER UNLESS INDEED
THEY BROUGHT ON THEIR WINGS THE BURDEN OF THUNDER CLOUDS UNDER THE
WEIGHT AND WARMTH OF WHICH ALL ENERGY DIED
BITTER AND DARK AS WAS THIS JANUARY DAY I REMEMBER LEAVING THE CLASSE
AND RUNNING DOWN WITHOUT BONNET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LONG GARDEN AND
THEN LINGERING AMONGST THE STRIPPED SHRUBS IN THE FORLORN HOPE THAT
THE POSTMAN'S RING MIGHT OCCUR WHILE I WAS OUT OF HEARING AND I MIGHT
THUS BE SPARED THE THRILL WHICH SOME PARTICULAR NERVE OR NERVES ALMOST
GNAWED THROUGH WITH THE UNREMITTING TOOTH OF A FIXED IDEA WERE
BECOMING WHOLLY UNFIT TO SUPPORT
I LINGERED AS LONG AS I DARED WITHOUT
FEAR OF ATTRACTING ATTENTION BY MY ABSENCE
I MUFFLED MY HEAD IN MY
APRON AND STOPPED MY EARS IN TERROR OF THE TORTURING CLANG SURE TO BE
FOLLOWED BY SUCH BLANK SILENCE SUCH BARREN VACUUM FOR ME
AT LAST I
VENTURED TO RE ENTER THE FIRST CLASSE WHERE AS IT WAS NOT YET NINE
O'CLOCK NO PUPILS HAD BEEN ADMITTED
THE FIRST THING SEEN WAS A WHITE
OBJECT ON MY BLACK DESK A WHITE FLAT OBJECT
THE POST HAD INDEED
ARRIVED BY ME UNHEARD
ROSINE HAD VISITED MY CELL AND LIKE SOME
ANGEL HAD LEFT BEHIND HER A BRIGHT TOKEN OF HER PRESENCE
THAT SHINING
THING ON THE DESK WAS INDEED A LETTER A REAL LETTER I SAW SO MUCH AT
THE DISTANCE OF THREE YARDS AND AS I HAD BUT ONE CORRESPONDENT ON
EARTH FROM THAT ONE IT MUST COME
HE REMEMBERED ME YET
HOW DEEP A
PULSE OF GRATITUDE SENT NEW LIFE THROUGH MY HEART
DRAWING NEAR BENDING AND LOOKING ON THE LETTER IN TREMBLING BUT
ALMOST CERTAIN HOPE OF SEEING A KNOWN HAND IT WAS MY LOT TO FIND ON
THE CONTRARY AN AUTOGRAPH FOR THE MOMENT DEEMED UNKNOWN A PALE FEMALE
SCRAWL INSTEAD OF A FIRM MASCULINE CHARACTER
I THEN THOUGHT FATE WAS
TOO HARD FOR ME AND I SAID AUDIBLY THIS IS CRUEL
BUT I GOT OVER THAT PAIN ALSO
LIFE IS STILL LIFE WHATEVER ITS PANGS
OUR EYES AND EARS AND THEIR USE REMAIN WITH US THOUGH THE PROSPECT OF
WHAT PLEASES BE WHOLLY WITHDRAWN AND THE SOUND OF WHAT CONSOLES BE
QUITE SILENCED
I OPENED THE BILLET BY THIS TIME I HAD RECOGNISED ITS HANDWRITING AS
PERFECTLY FAMILIAR
IT WAS DATED LA TERRASSE AND IT RAN THUS
DEAR LUCY IT OCCURS TO ME TO INQUIRE WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING WITH
YOURSELF FOR THE LAST MONTH OR TWO NOT THAT I SUSPECT YOU WOULD HAVE
THE LEAST DIFFICULTY IN GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF YOUR PROCEEDINGS
I
DARESAY YOU HAVE BEEN JUST AS BUSY AND AS HAPPY AS OURSELVES AT LA
TERRASSE
AS TO GRAHAM HIS PROFESSIONAL CONNECTION EXTENDS DAILY HE
IS SO MUCH SOUGHT AFTER SO MUCH ENGAGED THAT I TELL HIM HE WILL GROW
QUITE CONCEITED
LIKE A RIGHT GOOD MOTHER AS I AM I DO MY BEST TO
KEEP HIM DOWN NO FLATTERY DOES HE GET FROM ME AS YOU KNOW
AND YET
LUCY HE IS A FINE FELLOW HIS MOTHER'S HEART DANCES AT THE SIGHT OF
HIM
AFTER BEING HURRIED HERE AND THERE THE WHOLE DAY AND PASSING THE
ORDEAL OF FIFTY SORTS OF TEMPERS AND COMBATING A HUNDRED CAPRICES AND
SOMETIMES WITNESSING CRUEL SUFFERINGS PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY AS I TELL
HIM INFLICTING THEM AT NIGHT HE STILL COMES HOME TO ME IN SUCH
KINDLY PLEASANT MOOD THAT REALLY I SEEM TO LIVE IN A SORT OF MORAL
ANTIPODES AND ON THESE JANUARY EVENINGS MY DAY RISES WHEN OTHER
PEOPLE'S NIGHT SETS IN
STILL HE NEEDS KEEPING IN ORDER AND CORRECTING AND REPRESSING AND I
DO HIM THAT GOOD SERVICE BUT THE BOY IS SO ELASTIC THERE IS NO SUCH
THING AS VEXING HIM THOROUGHLY
WHEN I THINK I HAVE AT LAST DRIVEN HIM
TO THE SULLENS HE TURNS ON ME WITH JOKES FOR RETALIATION BUT YOU KNOW
HIM AND ALL HIS INIQUITIES AND I AM BUT AN ELDERLY SIMPLETON TO MAKE
HIM THE SUBJECT OF THIS EPISTLE
AS FOR ME I HAVE HAD MY OLD BRETTON AGENT HERE ON A VISIT AND HAVE
BEEN PLUNGED OVERHEAD AND EARS IN BUSINESS MATTERS
I DO SO WISH TO
REGAIN FOR GRAHAM AT LEAST SOME PART OF WHAT HIS FATHER LEFT HIM
HE
LAUGHS TO SCORN MY ANXIETY ON THIS POINT BIDDING ME LOOK AND SEE HOW
HE CAN PROVIDE FOR HIMSELF AND ME TOO AND ASKING WHAT THE OLD LADY CAN
POSSIBLY WANT THAT SHE HAS NOT HINTING ABOUT SKY BLUE TURBANS
ACCUSING ME OF AN AMBITION TO WEAR DIAMONDS KEEP LIVERY SERVANTS HAVE
AN HOTEL AND LEAD THE FASHION AMONGST THE ENGLISH CLAN IN VILLETTE
TALKING OF SKY BLUE TURBANS I WISH YOU HAD BEEN WITH US THE OTHER
EVENING
HE HAD COME IN REALLY TIRED AND AFTER I HAD GIVEN HIM HIS
TEA HE THREW HIMSELF INTO MY CHAIR WITH HIS CUSTOMARY PRESUMPTION
TO
MY GREAT DELIGHT HE DROPPED ASLEEP
YOU KNOW HOW HE TEASES ME ABOUT
BEING DROWSY I WHO NEVER BY ANY CHANCE CLOSE AN EYE BY DAYLIGHT
WHILE HE SLEPT I THOUGHT HE LOOKED VERY BONNY LUCY FOOL AS I AM TO
BE SO PROUD OF HIM BUT WHO CAN HELP IT SHOW ME HIS PEER
LOOK WHERE I
WILL I SEE NOTHING LIKE HIM IN VILLETTE
WELL I TOOK IT INTO MY HEAD
TO PLAY HIM A TRICK SO I BROUGHT OUT THE SKY BLUE TURBAN AND HANDLING
IT WITH GINGERLY PRECAUTION I MANAGED TO INVEST HIS BROWS WITH THIS
GRAND ADORNMENT
I ASSURE YOU IT DID NOT AT ALL MISBECOME HIM HE
LOOKED QUITE EASTERN EXCEPT THAT HE IS SO FAIR
NOBODY HOWEVER CAN
ACCUSE HIM OF HAVING RED HAIR NOW IT IS GENUINE CHESTNUT A DARK
GLOSSY CHESTNUT AND WHEN I PUT MY LARGE CASHMERE ABOUT HIM THERE WAS
AS FINE A YOUNG BEY DEY OR PACHA IMPROVISED AS YOU WOULD WISH TO SEE
IT WAS GOOD ENTERTAINMENT BUT ONLY HALF ENJOYED SINCE I WAS ALONE
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
IN DUE TIME MY LORD AWOKE THE LOOKING GLASS ABOVE THE FIREPLACE SOON
INTIMATED TO HIM HIS PLIGHT AS YOU MAY IMAGINE I NOW LIVE UNDER
THREAT AND DREAD OF VENGEANCE
BUT TO COME TO THE GIST OF MY LETTER
I KNOW THURSDAY IS A
HALF HOLIDAY IN THE RUE FOSSETTE BE READY THEN BY FIVE IN THE
AFTERNOON AT WHICH HOUR I WILL SEND THE CARRIAGE TO TAKE YOU OUT TO LA
TERRASSE
BE SURE TO COME YOU MAY MEET SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCE
GOOD BY
MY WISE DEAR GRAVE LITTLE GOD DAUGHTER VERY TRULY YOURS
LOUISA BRETTON
NOW A LETTER LIKE THAT SETS ONE TO RIGHTS I MIGHT STILL BE SAD AFTER
READING THAT LETTER BUT I WAS MORE COMPOSED NOT EXACTLY CHEERED
PERHAPS BUT RELIEVED
MY FRIENDS AT LEAST WERE WELL AND HAPPY NO
ACCIDENT HAD OCCURRED TO GRAHAM NO ILLNESS HAD SEIZED HIS
MOTHER CALAMITIES THAT HAD SO LONG BEEN MY DREAM AND THOUGHT
THEIR
FEELINGS FOR ME TOO WERE AS THEY HAD BEEN
YET HOW STRANGE IT WAS TO
LOOK ON MRS
BRETTON'S SEVEN WEEKS AND CONTRAST THEM WITH MY SEVEN
WEEKS ALSO HOW VERY WISE IT IS IN PEOPLE PLACED IN AN EXCEPTIONAL
POSITION TO HOLD THEIR TONGUES AND NOT RASHLY DECLARE HOW SUCH POSITION
GALLS THEM THE WORLD CAN UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH THE PROCESS OF
PERISHING FOR WANT OF FOOD PERHAPS FEW PERSONS CAN ENTER INTO OR
FOLLOW OUT THAT OF GOING MAD FROM SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
THEY SEE THE
LONG BURIED PRISONER DISINTERRED A MANIAC OR AN IDIOT HOW HIS SENSES
LEFT HIM HOW HIS NERVES FIRST INFLAMED UNDERWENT NAMELESS AGONY AND
THEN SUNK TO PALSY IS A SUBJECT TOO INTRICATE FOR EXAMINATION TOO
ABSTRACT FOR POPULAR COMPREHENSION
SPEAK OF IT YOU MIGHT ALMOST AS
WELL STAND UP IN AN EUROPEAN MARKET PLACE AND PROPOUND DARK SAYINGS IN
THAT LANGUAGE AND MOOD WHEREIN NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE IMPERIAL
HYPOCHONDRIAC COMMUNED WITH HIS BAFFLED CHALDEANS
AND LONG LONG MAY
THE MINDS TO WHOM SUCH THEMES ARE NO MYSTERY BY WHOM THEIR BEARINGS
ARE SYMPATHETICALLY SEIZED BE FEW IN NUMBER AND RARE OF RENCOUNTER
LONG MAY IT BE GENERALLY THOUGHT THAT PHYSICAL PRIVATIONS ALONE MERIT
COMPASSION AND THAT THE REST IS A FIGMENT
WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNGER
AND HALER THAN NOW MORAL TRIALS WERE A DEEPER MYSTERY STILL PERHAPS
IN ALL THE LAND OF ISRAEL THERE WAS BUT ONE SAUL CERTAINLY BUT ONE
DAVID TO SOOTHE OR COMPREHEND HIM
THE KEEN STILL COLD OF THE MORNING WAS SUCCEEDED LATER IN THE DAY BY
A SHARP BREATHING FROM RUSSIAN WASTES THE COLD ZONE SIGHED OVER THE
TEMPERATE ZONE AND FROZE IT FAST
A HEAVY FIRMAMENT DULL AND THICK
WITH SNOW SAILED UP FROM THE NORTH AND SETTLED OVER EXPECTANT EUROPE
TOWARDS AFTERNOON BEGAN THE DESCENT
I FEARED NO CARRIAGE WOULD COME
THE WHITE TEMPEST RAGED SO DENSE AND WILD
BUT TRUST MY GODMOTHER ONCE
HAVING ASKED SHE WOULD HAVE HER GUEST
ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK I WAS LIFTED
FROM THE CARRIAGE OVER THE ALREADY BLOCKED UP FRONT STEPS OF THE
CHTEAU AND PUT IN AT THE DOOR OF LA TERRASSE
RUNNING THROUGH THE VESTIBULE AND UP STAIRS TO THE DRAWING ROOM THERE
I FOUND MRS
BRETTON A SUMMER DAY IN HER OWN PERSON
HAD I BEEN TWICE
AS COLD AS I WAS HER KIND KISS AND CORDIAL CLASP WOULD HAVE WARMED ME
INURED NOW FOR SO LONG A TIME TO ROOMS WITH BARE BOARDS BLACK BENCHES
DESKS AND STOVES THE BLUE SALOON SEEMED TO ME GORGEOUS
IN ITS
CHRISTMAS LIKE FIRE ALONE THERE WAS A CLEAR AND CRIMSON SPLENDOUR WHICH
QUITE DAZZLED ME
WHEN MY GODMOTHER HAD HELD MY HAND FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND CHATTED WITH
ME AND SCOLDED ME FOR HAVING BECOME THINNER THAN WHEN SHE LAST SAW ME
SHE PROFESSED TO DISCOVER THAT THE SNOW WIND HAD DISORDERED MY HAIR
AND SENT ME UP STAIRS TO MAKE IT NEAT AND REMOVE MY SHAWL
REPAIRING TO MY OWN LITTLE SEA GREEN ROOM THERE ALSO I FOUND A BRIGHT
FIRE AND CANDLES TOO WERE LIT A TALL WAXLIGHT STOOD ON EACH SIDE THE
GREAT LOOKING GLASS BUT BETWEEN THE CANDLES AND BEFORE THE GLASS
APPEARED SOMETHING DRESSING ITSELF AN AIRY FAIRY THING SMALL
SLIGHT WHITE A WINTER SPIRIT
I DECLARE FOR ONE MOMENT I THOUGHT OF GRAHAM AND HIS SPECTRAL
ILLUSIONS
WITH DISTRUSTFUL EYE I NOTED THE DETAILS OF THIS NEW VISION
IT WORE WHITE SPRINKLED SLIGHTLY WITH DROPS OF SCARLET ITS GIRDLE WAS
RED IT HAD SOMETHING IN ITS HAIR LEAFY YET SHINING A LITTLE WREATH
WITH AN EVERGREEN GLOSS
SPECTRAL OR NOT HERE TRULY WAS NOTHING
FRIGHTFUL AND I ADVANCED
TURNING QUICK UPON ME A LARGE EYE UNDER LONG LASHES FLASHED OVER ME
THE INTRUDER THE LASHES WERE AS DARK AS LONG AND THEY SOFTENED WITH
THEIR PENCILLING THE ORB THEY GUARDED
AH YOU ARE COME SHE BREATHED OUT IN A SOFT QUIET VOICE AND SHE
SMILED SLOWLY AND GAZED INTENTLY
I KNEW HER NOW
HAVING ONLY ONCE SEEN THAT SORT OF FACE WITH THAT CAST
OF FINE AND DELICATE FEATURING I COULD NOT BUT KNOW HER
MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE I PRONOUNCED
NO WAS THE REPLY NOT MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE FOR YOU I DID NOT
INQUIRE WHO THEN SHE MIGHT BE BUT WAITED VOLUNTARY INFORMATION
YOU ARE CHANGED BUT STILL YOU ARE YOURSELF SHE SAID APPROACHING
NEARER
I REMEMBER YOU WELL YOUR COUNTENANCE THE COLOUR OF YOUR
HAIR THE OUTLINE OF YOUR FACE
I HAD MOVED TO THE FIRE AND SHE STOOD OPPOSITE AND GAZED INTO ME AND
AS SHE GAZED HER FACE BECAME GRADUALLY MORE AND MORE EXPRESSIVE OF
THOUGHT AND FEELING TILL AT LAST A DIMNESS QUENCHED HER CLEAR VISION
IT MAKES ME ALMOST CRY TO LOOK SO FAR BACK SAID SHE BUT AS TO
BEING SORRY OR SENTIMENTAL DON'T THINK IT ON THE CONTRARY I AM
QUITE PLEASED AND GLAD
INTERESTED YET ALTOGETHER AT FAULT I KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY
AT LAST I
STAMMERED I THINK I NEVER MET YOU TILL THAT NIGHT SOME WEEKS AGO
WHEN YOU WERE HURT
SHE SMILED
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THEN THAT I HAVE SAT ON YOUR KNEE BEEN
LIFTED IN YOUR ARMS EVEN SHARED YOUR PILLOW YOU NO LONGER REMEMBER
THE NIGHT WHEN I CAME CRYING LIKE A NAUGHTY LITTLE CHILD AS I WAS TO
YOUR BEDSIDE AND YOU TOOK ME IN
YOU HAVE NO MEMORY FOR THE COMFORT
AND PROTECTION BY WHICH YOU SOOTHED AN ACUTE DISTRESS GO BACK TO
BRETTON
REMEMBER MR
HOME
AT LAST I SAW IT ALL
AND YOU ARE LITTLE POLLY
I AM PAULINA MARY HOME DE BASSOMPIERRE
HOW TIME CAN CHANGE LITTLE POLLY WORE IN HER PALE SMALL FEATURES HER
FAIRY SYMMETRY HER VARYING EXPRESSION A CERTAIN PROMISE OF INTEREST
AND GRACE BUT PAULINA MARY WAS BECOME BEAUTIFUL NOT WITH THE BEAUTY
THAT STRIKES THE EYE LIKE A ROSE ORBED RUDDY AND REPLETE NOT WITH
THE PLUMP AND PINK AND FLAXEN ATTRIBUTES OF HER BLOND COUSIN GINEVRA
BUT HER SEVENTEEN YEARS HAD BROUGHT HER A REFINED AND TENDER CHARM
WHICH DID NOT LIE IN COMPLEXION THOUGH HERS WAS FAIR AND CLEAR NOR IN
OUTLINE THOUGH HER FEATURES WERE SWEET AND HER LIMBS PERFECTLY
TURNED BUT I THINK RATHER IN A SUBDUED GLOW FROM THE SOUL OUTWARD
THIS WAS NOT AN OPAQUE VASE OF MATERIAL HOWEVER COSTLY BUT A LAMP
CHASTELY LUCENT GUARDING FROM EXTINCTION YET NOT HIDING FROM WORSHIP
A FLAME VITAL AND VESTAL
IN SPEAKING OF HER ATTRACTIONS I WOULD NOT
EXAGGERATE LANGUAGE BUT INDEED THEY SEEMED TO ME VERY REAL AND
ENGAGING
WHAT THOUGH ALL WAS ON A SMALL SCALE IT WAS THE PERFUME
WHICH GAVE THIS WHITE VIOLET DISTINCTION AND MADE IT SUPERIOR TO THE
BROADEST CAMELIA THE FULLEST DAHLIA THAT EVER BLOOMED
AH AND YOU REMEMBER THE OLD TIME AT BRETTON
BETTER SAID SHE BETTER PERHAPS THAN YOU
I REMEMBER IT WITH
MINUTE DISTINCTNESS NOT ONLY THE TIME BUT THE DAYS OF THE TIME AND
THE HOURS OF THE DAYS
YOU MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN SOME THINGS
VERY LITTLE I IMAGINE
YOU WERE THEN A LITTLE CREATURE OF QUICK FEELINGS YOU MUST LONG ERE
THIS HAVE OUTGROWN THE IMPRESSIONS WITH WHICH JOY AND GRIEF AFFECTION
AND BEREAVEMENT STAMPED YOUR MIND TEN YEARS AGO
YOU THINK I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHOM I LIKED AND IN WHAT DEGREE I LIKED
THEM WHEN A CHILD
THE SHARPNESS MUST BE GONE THE POINT THE POIGNANCY THE DEEP IMPRINT
MUST BE SOFTENED AWAY AND EFFACED
I HAVE A GOOD MEMORY FOR THOSE DAYS
SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD
HER EYES WERE THE EYES OF ONE WHO CAN
REMEMBER ONE WHOSE CHILDHOOD DOES NOT FADE LIKE A DREAM NOR WHOSE
YOUTH VANISH LIKE A SUNBEAM
SHE WOULD NOT TAKE LIFE LOOSELY AND
INCOHERENTLY IN PARTS AND LET ONE SEASON SLIP AS SHE ENTERED ON
ANOTHER SHE WOULD RETAIN AND ADD OFTEN REVIEW FROM THE COMMENCEMENT
AND SO GROW IN HARMONY AND CONSISTENCY AS SHE GREW IN YEARS
STILL I
COULD NOT QUITE ADMIT THE CONVICTION THAT ALL THE PICTURES WHICH NOW
CROWDED UPON ME WERE VIVID AND VISIBLE TO HER
HER FOND ATTACHMENTS
HER SPORTS AND CONTESTS WITH A WELL LOVED PLAYMATE THE PATIENT TRUE
DEVOTION OF HER CHILD'S HEART HER FEARS HER DELICATE RESERVES HER
LITTLE TRIALS THE LAST PIERCING PAIN OF SEPARATION
I RETRACED
THESE THINGS AND SHOOK MY HEAD INCREDULOUS
SHE PERSISTED
THE CHILD
OF SEVEN YEARS LIVES YET IN THE GIRL OF SEVENTEEN SAID SHE
YOU USED TO BE EXCESSIVELY FOND OF MRS
BRETTON I REMARKED
INTENDING TO TEST HER
SHE SET ME RIGHT AT ONCE
NOT EXCESSIVELY FOND SAID SHE I LIKED HER I RESPECTED HER AS I
SHOULD DO NOW SHE SEEMS TO ME VERY LITTLE ALTERED
SHE IS NOT MUCH CHANGED I ASSENTED
WE WERE SILENT A FEW MINUTES
GLANCING ROUND THE ROOM SHE SAID THERE
ARE SEVERAL THINGS HERE THAT USED TO BE AT BRETTON I REMEMBER THAT
PINCUSHION AND THAT LOOKING GLASS
EVIDENTLY SHE WAS NOT DECEIVED IN HER ESTIMATE OF HER OWN MEMORY NOT
AT LEAST SO FAR
YOU THINK THEN YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN MRS
BRETTON I WENT ON
I PERFECTLY REMEMBERED HER THE TURN OF HER FEATURES HER OLIVE
COMPLEXION AND BLACK HAIR HER HEIGHT HER WALK HER VOICE
DR
BRETTON OF COURSE I PURSUED WOULD BE OUT OF THE QUESTION
AND INDEED AS I SAW YOUR FIRST INTERVIEW WITH HIM I AM AWARE THAT HE
APPEARED TO YOU AS A STRANGER
THAT FIRST NIGHT I WAS PUZZLED SHE ANSWERED
HOW DID THE RECOGNITION BETWEEN HIM AND YOUR FATHER COME ABOUT
THEY EXCHANGED CARDS
THE NAMES GRAHAM BRETTON AND HOME DE
BASSOMPIERRE GAVE RISE TO QUESTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS
THAT WAS ON THE
SECOND DAY BUT BEFORE THEN I WAS BEGINNING TO KNOW SOMETHING
HOW KNOW SOMETHING
WHY SHE SAID HOW STRANGE IT IS THAT MOST PEOPLE SEEM SO SLOW TO
FEEL THE TRUTH NOT TO SEE BUT FEEL WHEN DR
BRETTON HAD VISITED ME
A FEW TIMES AND SAT NEAR AND TALKED TO ME WHEN I HAD OBSERVED THE
LOOK IN HIS EYES THE EXPRESSION ABOUT HIS MOUTH THE FORM OF HIS CHIN
THE CARRIAGE OF HIS HEAD AND ALL THAT WE DO OBSERVE IN PERSONS WHO
APPROACH US HOW COULD I AVOID BEING LED BY ASSOCIATION TO THINK OF
GRAHAM BRETTON GRAHAM WAS SLIGHTER THAN HE AND NOT GROWN SO TALL AND
HAD A SMOOTHER FACE AND LONGER AND LIGHTER HAIR AND SPOKE NOT SO
DEEPLY MORE LIKE A GIRL BUT YET HE IS GRAHAM JUST AS I AM LITTLE
POLLY OR YOU ARE LUCY SNOWE
I THOUGHT THE SAME BUT I WONDERED TO FIND MY THOUGHTS HERS THERE ARE
CERTAIN THINGS IN WHICH WE SO RARELY MEET WITH OUR DOUBLE THAT IT SEEMS
A MIRACLE WHEN THAT CHANCE BEFALLS
YOU AND GRAHAM WERE ONCE PLAYMATES
AND DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SHE QUESTIONED IN HER TURN
NO DOUBT HE WILL REMEMBER IT ALSO SAID I
I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM FEW THINGS WOULD SURPRISE ME SO MUCH AS TO FIND
THAT HE DID
I SUPPOSE HIS DISPOSITION IS STILL GAY AND CARELESS
WAS IT SO FORMERLY DID IT SO STRIKE YOU DO YOU THUS REMEMBER HIM
I SCARCELY REMEMBER HIM IN ANY OTHER LIGHT
SOMETIMES HE WAS STUDIOUS
SOMETIMES HE WAS MERRY BUT WHETHER BUSY WITH HIS BOOKS OR DISPOSED FOR
PLAY IT WAS CHIEFLY THE BOOKS OR GAME HE THOUGHT OF NOT MUCH HEEDING
THOSE WITH WHOM HE READ OR AMUSED HIMSELF
YET TO YOU HE WAS PARTIAL
PARTIAL TO ME OH NO HE HAD OTHER PLAYMATES HIS SCHOOL FELLOWS I
WAS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO HIM EXCEPT ON SUNDAYS YES HE WAS KIND
ON SUNDAYS
I REMEMBER WALKING WITH HIM HAND IN HAND TO ST
MARY'S AND
HIS FINDING THE PLACES IN MY PRAYER BOOK AND HOW GOOD AND STILL HE WAS
ON SUNDAY EVENINGS SO MILD FOR SUCH A PROUD LIVELY BOY SO PATIENT
WITH ALL MY BLUNDERS IN READING AND SO WONDERFULLY TO BE DEPENDED ON
FOR HE NEVER SPENT THOSE EVENINGS FROM HOME I HAD A CONSTANT FEAR THAT
HE WOULD ACCEPT SOME INVITATION AND FORSAKE US BUT HE NEVER DID NOR
SEEMED EVER TO WISH TO DO IT
THUS OF COURSE IT CAN BE NO MORE
I
SUPPOSE SUNDAY WILL NOW BE DR
BRETTON'S DINING OUT DAY
CHILDREN COME DOWN HERE CALLED MRS
BRETTON FROM BELOW
PAULINA
WOULD STILL HAVE LINGERED BUT I INCLINED TO DESCEND WE WENT DOWN
CHAPTER XXV
THE LITTLE COUNTESS
CHEERFUL AS MY GODMOTHER NATURALLY WAS AND ENTERTAINING AS FOR OUR
SAKES SHE MADE A POINT OF BEING THERE WAS NO TRUE ENJOYMENT THAT
EVENING AT LA TERRASSE TILL THROUGH THE WILD HOWL OF THE
WINTER NIGHT WERE HEARD THE SIGNAL SOUNDS OF ARRIVAL
HOW OFTEN WHILE
WOMEN AND GIRLS SIT WARM AT SNUG FIRE SIDES THEIR HEARTS AND
IMAGINATIONS ARE DOOMED TO DIVORCE FROM THE COMFORT SURROUNDING THEIR
PERSONS FORCED OUT BY NIGHT TO WANDER THROUGH DARK WAYS TO DARE
STRESS OF WEATHER TO CONTEND WITH THE SNOW BLAST TO WAIT AT LONELY
GATES AND STILES IN WILDEST STORMS WATCHING AND LISTENING TO SEE AND
HEAR THE FATHER THE SON THE HUSBAND COMING HOME
FATHER AND SON CAME AT LAST TO THE CHTEAU FOR THE COUNT DE
BASSOMPIERRE THAT NIGHT ACCOMPANIED DR
BRETTON
I KNOW NOT WHICH OF
OUR TRIO HEARD THE HORSES FIRST THE ASPERITY THE VIOLENCE OF THE
WEATHER WARRANTED OUR RUNNING DOWN INTO THE HALL TO MEET AND GREET THE
TWO RIDERS AS THEY CAME IN BUT THEY WARNED US TO KEEP OUR DISTANCE
BOTH WERE WHITE TWO MOUNTAINS OF SNOW AND INDEED MRS
BRETTON SEEING
THEIR CONDITION ORDERED THEM INSTANTLY TO THE KITCHEN PROHIBITING
THEM AT THEIR PERIL FROM SETTING FOOT ON HER CARPETED STAIRCASE TILL
THEY HAD SEVERALLY PUT OFF THAT MASK OF OLD CHRISTMAS THEY NOW
AFFECTED
INTO THE KITCHEN HOWEVER WE COULD NOT HELP FOLLOWING THEM
IT WAS A LARGE OLD DUTCH KITCHEN PICTURESQUE AND PLEASANT
THE LITTLE
WHITE COUNTESS DANCED IN A CIRCLE ABOUT HER EQUALLY WHITE SIRE
CLAPPING HER HANDS AND CRYING PAPA PAPA YOU LOOK LIKE AN ENORMOUS
POLAR BEAR
THE BEAR SHOOK HIMSELF AND THE LITTLE SPRITE FLED FAR FROM THE FROZEN
SHOWER
BACK SHE CAME HOWEVER LAUGHING AND EAGER TO AID IN REMOVING
THE ARCTIC DISGUISE
THE COUNT AT LAST ISSUING FROM HIS DREADNOUGHT
THREATENED TO OVERWHELM HER WITH IT AS WITH AN AVALANCHE
COME THEN SAID SHE BENDING TO INVITE THE FALL AND WHEN IT WAS
PLAYFULLY ADVANCED ABOVE HER HEAD BOUNDING OUT OF REACH LIKE SOME
LITTLE CHAMOIS
HER MOVEMENTS HAD THE SUPPLE SOFTNESS THE VELVET GRACE OF A KITTEN
HER LAUGH WAS CLEARER THAN THE RING OF SILVER AND CRYSTAL AS SHE TOOK
HER SIRE'S COLD HANDS AND RUBBED THEM AND STOOD ON TIPTOE TO REACH HIS
LIPS FOR A KISS THERE SEEMED TO SHINE ROUND HER A HALO OF LOVING
DELIGHT
THE GRAVE AND REVEREND SEIGNOR LOOKED DOWN ON HER AS MEN DO
LOOK ON WHAT IS THE APPLE OF THEIR EYE
MRS
BRETTON SAID HE WHAT AM I TO DO WITH THIS DAUGHTER OR
DAUGHTERLING OF MINE SHE NEITHER GROWS IN WISDOM NOR IN STATURE
DON'T
YOU FIND HER PRETTY NEARLY AS MUCH THE CHILD AS SHE WAS TEN YEARS AGO
SHE CANNOT BE MORE THE CHILD THAN THIS GREAT BOY OF MINE SAID MRS
BRETTON WHO WAS IN CONFLICT WITH HER SON ABOUT SOME CHANGE OF DRESS
SHE DEEMED ADVISABLE AND WHICH HE RESISTED
HE STOOD LEANING AGAINST
THE DUTCH DRESSER LAUGHING AND KEEPING HER AT ARM'S LENGTH
COME MAMMA SAID HE BY WAY OF COMPROMISE AND TO SECURE FOR US
INWARD AS WELL AS OUTWARD WARMTH LET US HAVE A CHRISTMAS WASSAIL CUP
AND TOAST OLD ENGLAND HERE ON THE HEARTH
SO WHILE THE COUNT STOOD BY THE FIRE AND PAULINA MARY STILL DANCED TO
AND FRO HAPPY IN THE LIBERTY OF THE WIDE HALL LIKE KITCHEN MRS
BRETTON HERSELF INSTRUCTED MARTHA TO SPICE AND HEAT THE WASSAIL BOWL
AND POURING THE DRAUGHT INTO A BRETTON FLAGON IT WAS SERVED ROUND
REAMING HOT BY MEANS OF A SMALL SILVER VESSEL WHICH I RECOGNISED AS
GRAHAM'S CHRISTENING CUP
HERE'S TO AULD LANG SYNE SAID THE COUNT HOLDING THE GLANCING CUP ON
HIGH
THEN LOOKING AT MRS
BRETTON
WE TWA HA' PAIDLET I' THE BURN
FRA MORNING SUN TILL DINE
BUT SEAS BETWEEN US BRAID HA' ROARED
SIN' AULD LANE SYNE
AND SURELY YE'LL BE YOUR PINT STOUP
AND SURELY I'LL BE MINE
AND WE'LL TASTE A CUP O' KINDNESS YET
FOR AULD LANG SYNE
SCOTCH SCOTCH CRIED PAULINA PAPA IS TALKING SCOTCH AND SCOTCH HE
IS PARTLY
WE ARE HOME AND DE BASSOMPIERRE CALEDONIAN AND GALLIC
AND IS THAT A SCOTCH REEL YOU ARE DANCING YOU HIGHLAND FAIRY ASKED
HER FATHER
MRS
BRETTON THERE WILL BE A GREEN RING GROWING UP IN THE
MIDDLE OF YOUR KITCHEN SHORTLY
I WOULD NOT ANSWER FOR HER BEING QUITE
CANNIE SHE IS A STRANGE LITTLE MORTAL
TELL LUCY TO DANCE WITH ME PAPA THERE IS LUCY SNOWE
MR
HOME THERE WAS STILL QUITE AS MUCH ABOUT HIM OF PLAIN MR
HOME AS
OF PROUD COUNT DE BASSOMPIERRE HELD HIS HAND OUT TO ME SAYING KINDLY
HE REMEMBERED ME WELL AND EVEN HAD HIS OWN MEMORY BEEN LESS
TRUSTWORTHY MY NAME WAS SO OFTEN ON HIS DAUGHTER'S LIPS AND HE HAD
LISTENED TO SO MANY LONG TALES ABOUT ME I SHOULD SEEM LIKE AN OLD
ACQUAINTANCE
EVERY ONE NOW HAD TASTED THE WASSAIL CUP EXCEPT PAULINA WHOSE PAS DE
FE OU DE FANTAISIE NOBODY THOUGHT OF INTERRUPTING TO OFFER SO
PROFANATORY A DRAUGHT BUT SHE WAS NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED NOR BAULKED OF
HER MORTAL PRIVILEGES
LET ME TASTE SAID SHE TO GRAHAM AS HE WAS PUTTING THE CUP ON THE
SHELF OF THE DRESSER OUT OF HER REACH
MRS
BRETTON AND MR
HOME WERE NOW ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION
DR
JOHN
HAD NOT BEEN UNOBSERVANT OF THE FAIRY'S DANCE HE HAD WATCHED IT AND
HE HAD LIKED IT
TO SAY NOTHING OF THE SOFTNESS AND BEAUTY OF THE
MOVEMENTS EMINENTLY GRATEFUL TO HIS GRACE LOVING EYE THAT EASE IN HIS
MOTHER'S HOUSE CHARMED HIM FOR IT SET HIM AT EASE AGAIN SHE SEEMED
A CHILD FOR HIM AGAIN ALMOST HIS PLAYMATE
I WONDERED HOW HE WOULD
SPEAK TO HER I HAD NOT YET SEEN HIM ADDRESS HER HIS FIRST WORDS
PROVED THAT THE OLD DAYS OF LITTLE POLLY HAD BEEN RECALLED TO HIS
MIND BY THIS EVENING'S CHILD LIKE LIGHT HEARTEDNESS
YOUR LADYSHIP WISHES FOR THE TANKARD
I THINK I SAID SO
I THINK I INTIMATED AS MUCH
COULDN'T CONSENT TO A STEP OF THE KIND ON ANY ACCOUNT
SORRY FOR IT
BUT COULDN'T DO IT
WHY I AM QUITE WELL NOW IT CAN'T BREAK MY COLLAR BONE AGAIN OR
DISLOCATE MY SHOULDER
IS IT WINE
NO NOR DEW
I DON'T WANT DEW I DON'T LIKE DEW BUT WHAT IS IT
ALE STRONG ALE OLD OCTOBER BREWED PERHAPS WHEN I WAS BORN
IT MUST BE CURIOUS IS IT GOOD
EXCESSIVELY GOOD
AND HE TOOK IT DOWN ADMINISTERED TO HIMSELF A SECOND DOSE OF THIS
MIGHTY ELIXIR EXPRESSED IN HIS MISCHIEVOUS EYES EXTREME CONTENTMENT
WITH THE SAME AND SOLEMNLY REPLACED THE CUP ON THE SHELF
I SHOULD LIKE A LITTLE SAID PAULINA LOOKING UP I NEVER HAD ANY
'OLD OCTOBER IS IT SWEET
PERILOUSLY SWEET SAID GRAHAM
SHE CONTINUED TO LOOK UP EXACTLY WITH THE COUNTENANCE OF A CHILD THAT
LONGS FOR SOME PROHIBITED DAINTY
AT LAST THE DOCTOR RELENTED TOOK IT
DOWN AND INDULGED HIMSELF IN THE GRATIFICATION OF LETTING HER TASTE
FROM HIS HAND HIS EYES ALWAYS EXPRESSIVE IN THE REVELATION OF
PLEASURABLE FEELINGS LUMINOUSLY AND SMILINGLY AVOWED THAT IT WAS A
GRATIFICATION AND HE PROLONGED IT BY SO REGULATING THE POSITION OF THE
CUP THAT ONLY A DROP AT A TIME COULD REACH THE ROSY SIPPING LIPS BY
WHICH ITS BRIM WAS COURTED
A LITTLE MORE A LITTLE MORE SAID SHE PETULANTLY TOUCHING HIS HAND
WITH THE FOREFINGER TO MAKE HIM INCLINE THE CUP MORE GENEROUSLY AND
YIELDINGLY
IT SMELLS OF SPICE AND SUGAR BUT I CAN'T TASTE IT YOUR
WRIST IS SO STIFF AND YOU ARE SO STINGY
HE INDULGED HER WHISPERING HOWEVER WITH GRAVITY DON'T TELL MY
MOTHER OR LUCY THEY WOULDN'T APPROVE
NOR DO I SAID SHE PASSING INTO ANOTHER TONE AND MANNER AS SOON AS
SHE HAD FAIRLY ASSAYED THE BEVERAGE JUST AS IF IT HAD ACTED UPON HER
LIKE SOME DISENCHANTING DRAUGHT UNDOING THE WORK OF A WIZARD I FIND
IT ANYTHING BUT SWEET IT IS BITTER AND HOT AND TAKES AWAY MY BREATH
YOUR OLD OCTOBER WAS ONLY DESIRABLE WHILE FORBIDDEN
THANK YOU NO
MORE
AND WITH A SLIGHT BEND CARELESS BUT AS GRACEFUL AS HER DANCE SHE
GLIDED FROM HIM AND REJOINED HER FATHER
I THINK SHE HAD SPOKEN TRUTH THE CHILD OF SEVEN WAS IN THE GIRL OF
SEVENTEEN
GRAHAM LOOKED AFTER HER A LITTLE BAFFLED A LITTLE PUZZLED HIS EYE WAS
ON HER A GOOD DEAL DURING THE REST OF THE EVENING BUT SHE DID NOT SEEM
TO NOTICE HIM
AS WE ASCENDED TO THE DRAWING ROOM FOR TEA SHE TOOK HER FATHER'S ARM
HER NATURAL PLACE SEEMED TO BE AT HIS SIDE HER EYES AND HER EARS WERE
DEDICATED TO HIM
HE AND MRS
BRETTON WERE THE CHIEF TALKERS OF OUR
LITTLE PARTY AND PAULINA WAS THEIR BEST LISTENER ATTENDING CLOSELY TO
ALL THAT WAS SAID PROMPTING THE REPETITION OF THIS OR THAT TRAIT OR
ADVENTURE
AND WHERE WERE YOU AT SUCH A TIME PAPA AND WHAT DID YOU SAY THEN
AND TELL MRS
BRETTON WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT OCCASION THUS SHE DREW
HIM OUT
SHE DID NOT AGAIN YIELD TO ANY EFFERVESCENCE OF GLEE THE INFANTINE
SPARKLE WAS EXHALED FOR THE NIGHT SHE WAS SOFT THOUGHTFUL AND
DOCILE
IT WAS PRETTY TO SEE HER BID GOOD NIGHT HER MANNER TO GRAHAM
WAS TOUCHED WITH DIGNITY IN HER VERY SLIGHT SMILE AND QUIET BOW SPOKE
THE COUNTESS AND GRAHAM COULD NOT BUT LOOK GRAVE AND BEND RESPONSIVE
I SAW HE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO BLEND TOGETHER IN HIS IDEAS THE DANCING
FAIRY AND DELICATE DAME
NEXT DAY WHEN WE WERE ALL ASSEMBLED ROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE
SHIVERING AND FRESH FROM THE MORNING'S CHILL ABLUTIONS MRS
BRETTON
PRONOUNCED A DECREE THAT NOBODY WHO WAS NOT FORCED BY DIRE NECESSITY
SHOULD QUIT HER HOUSE THAT DAY
INDEED EGRESS SEEMED NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THE DRIFT DARKENED THE LOWER
PANES OF THE CASEMENT AND ON LOOKING OUT ONE SAW THE SKY AND AIR
VEXED AND DIM THE WIND AND SNOW IN ANGRY CONFLICT
THERE WAS NO FALL
NOW BUT WHAT HAD ALREADY DESCENDED WAS TORN UP FROM THE EARTH WHIRLED
ROUND BY BRIEF SHRIEKING GUSTS AND CAST INTO A HUNDRED FANTASTIC FORMS
THE COUNTESS SECONDED MRS
BRETTON
PAPA SHALL NOT GO OUT SAID SHE PLACING A SEAT FOR HERSELF BESIDE
HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR
I WILL LOOK AFTER HIM
YOU WON'T GO INTO TOWN
WILL YOU PAPA
AY AND NO WAS THE ANSWER
IF YOU AND MRS
BRETTON ARE VERY GOOD
TO ME POLLY KIND YOU KNOW AND ATTENTIVE IF YOU PET ME IN A VERY
NICE MANNER AND MAKE MUCH OF ME I MAY POSSIBLY BE INDUCED TO WAIT AN
HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST AND SEE WHETHER THIS RAZOR EDGED WIND SETTLES
BUT YOU SEE YOU GIVE ME NO BREAKFAST YOU OFFER ME NOTHING YOU LET
ME STARVE
QUICK PLEASE MRS
BRETTON AND POUR OUT THE COFFEE ENTREATED
PAULINA WHILST I TAKE CARE OF THE COUNT DE BASSOMPIERRE IN OTHER
RESPECTS SINCE HE GREW INTO A COUNT HE HAS NEEDED SO MUCH
ATTENTION
SHE SEPARATED AND PREPARED A ROLL
THERE PAPA ARE YOUR 'PISTOLETS' CHARGED SAID SHE
AND THERE IS
SOME MARMALADE JUST THE SAME SORT OF MARMALADE WE USED TO HAVE AT
BRETTON AND WHICH YOU SAID WAS AS GOOD AS IF IT HAD BEEN CONSERVED IN
SCOTLAND
AND WHICH YOUR LITTLE LADYSHIP USED TO BEG FOR MY BOY DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT INTERPOSED MRS
BRETTON
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW YOU WOULD COME
TO MY ELBOW AND TOUCH MY SLEEVE WITH THE WHISPER 'PLEASE MA'AM
SOMETHING GOOD FOR GRAHAM A LITTLE MARMALADE OR HONEY OR JAM
NO MAMMA BROKE IN DR
JOHN LAUGHING YET REDDENING IT SURELY WAS
NOT SO I COULD NOT HAVE CARED FOR THESE THINGS
DID HE OR DID HE NOT PAULINA
HE LIKED THEM ASSERTED PAULINA
NEVER BLUSH FOR IT JOHN SAID MR
HOME ENCOURAGINGLY
I LIKE THEM
MYSELF YET AND ALWAYS DID
AND POLLY SHOWED HER SENSE IN CATERING FOR
A FRIEND'S MATERIAL COMFORTS IT WAS I WHO PUT HER INTO THE WAY OF SUCH
GOOD MANNERS NOR DO I LET HER FORGET THEM
POLLY OFFER ME A SMALL
SLICE OF THAT TONGUE
THERE PAPA BUT REMEMBER YOU ARE ONLY WAITED UPON WITH THIS
ASSIDUITY ON CONDITION OF BEING PERSUADABLE AND RECONCILING YOURSELF
TO LA TERRASSE FOR THE DAY
MRS
BRETTON SAID THE COUNT I WANT TO GET RID OF MY DAUGHTER TO
SEND HER TO SCHOOL
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY GOOD SCHOOL
THERE IS LUCY'S PLACE MADAME BECK'S
MISS SNOWE IS IN A SCHOOL
I AM A TEACHER I SAID AND WAS RATHER GLAD OF THE OPPORTUNITY OF
SAYING THIS
FOR A LITTLE WHILE I HAD BEEN FEELING AS IF PLACED IN A
FALSE POSITION
MRS
BRETTON AND SON KNEW MY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THE
COUNT AND HIS DAUGHTER DID NOT
THEY MIGHT CHOOSE TO VARY BY SOME
SHADES THEIR HITHERTO CORDIAL MANNER TOWARDS ME WHEN AWARE OF MY GRADE
IN SOCIETY
I SPOKE THEN READILY BUT A SWARM OF THOUGHTS I HAD NOT
ANTICIPATED NOR INVOKED ROSE DIM AT THE WORDS MAKING ME SIGH
INVOLUNTARILY
MR
HOME DID NOT LIFT HIS EYES FROM HIS BREAKFAST PLATE
FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES NOR DID HE SPEAK PERHAPS HE HAD NOT CAUGHT THE
WORDS PERHAPS HE THOUGHT THAT ON A CONFESSION OF THAT NATURE
POLITENESS WOULD INTERDICT COMMENT THE SCOTCH ARE PROVERBIALLY PROUD
AND HOMELY AS WAS MR
HOME IN LOOK SIMPLE IN HABITS AND TASTES I HAVE
ALL ALONG INTIMATED THAT HE WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SHARE OF THE NATIONAL
QUALITY
WAS HIS A PSEUDO PRIDE WAS IT REAL DIGNITY I LEAVE THE
QUESTION UNDECIDED IN ITS WIDE SENSE
WHERE IT CONCERNED ME
INDIVIDUALLY I CAN ONLY ANSWER THEN AND ALWAYS HE SHOWED HIMSELF A
TRUE HEARTED GENTLEMAN
BY NATURE HE WAS A FEELER AND A THINKER OVER HIS EMOTIONS AND HIS
REFLECTIONS SPREAD A MELLOWING OF MELANCHOLY MORE THAN A MELLOWING IN
TROUBLE AND BEREAVEMENT IT BECAME A CLOUD
HE DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT
LUCY SNOWE WHAT HE KNEW HE DID NOT VERY ACCURATELY COMPREHEND INDEED
HIS MISCONCEPTIONS OF MY CHARACTER OFTEN MADE ME SMILE BUT HE SAW MY
WALK IN LIFE LAY RATHER ON THE SHADY SIDE OF THE HILL HE GAVE ME
CREDIT FOR DOING MY ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP THE COURSE HONESTLY STRAIGHT HE
WOULD HAVE HELPED ME IF HE COULD HAVING NO OPPORTUNITY OF HELPING HE
STILL WISHED ME WELL
WHEN HE DID LOOK AT ME HIS EYE WAS KIND WHEN HE
DID SPEAK HIS VOICE WAS BENEVOLENT
YOURS SAID HE IS AN ARDUOUS CALLING
I WISH YOU HEALTH AND
STRENGTH TO WIN IN IT SUCCESS
HIS FAIR LITTLE DAUGHTER DID NOT TAKE THE INFORMATION QUITE SO
COMPOSEDLY SHE FIXED ON ME A PAIR OF EYES WIDE WITH WONDER ALMOST
WITH DISMAY
ARE YOU A TEACHER CRIED SHE
THEN HAVING PAUSED ON THE UNPALATABLE
IDEA WELL I NEVER KNEW WHAT YOU WERE NOR EVER THOUGHT OF ASKING
FOR ME YOU WERE ALWAYS LUCY SNOWE
AND WHAT AM I NOW I COULD NOT FORBEAR INQUIRING
YOURSELF OF COURSE
BUT DO YOU REALLY TEACH HERE IN VILLETTE
I REALLY DO
AND DO YOU LIKE IT
NOT ALWAYS
AND WHY DO YOU GO ON WITH IT
HER FATHER LOOKED AT AND I FEARED WAS GOING TO CHECK HER BUT HE
ONLY SAID PROCEED POLLY PROCEED WITH THAT CATECHISM PROVE YOURSELF
THE LITTLE WISEACRE YOU ARE
IF MISS SNOWE WERE TO BLUSH AND LOOK
CONFUSED I SHOULD HAVE TO BID YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND YOU AND I
WOULD SIT OUT THE PRESENT MEAL IN SOME DISGRACE BUT SHE ONLY SMILES
SO PUSH HER HARD MULTIPLY THE CROSS QUESTIONS
WELL MISS SNOWE WHY
DO YOU GO ON WITH IT
CHIEFLY I FEAR FOR THE SAKE OF THE MONEY I GET
NOT THEN FROM MOTIVES OF PURE PHILANTHROPY POLLY AND I WERE CLINGING
TO THAT HYPOTHESIS AS THE MOST LENIENT WAY OF ACCOUNTING FOR YOUR
ECCENTRICITY
NO NO SIR
RATHER FOR THE ROOF OF SHELTER I AM THUS ENABLED TO KEEP
OVER MY HEAD AND FOR THE COMFORT OF MIND IT GIVES ME TO THINK THAT
WHILE I CAN WORK FOR MYSELF I AM SPARED THE PAIN OF BEING A BURDEN TO
ANYBODY
PAPA SAY WHAT YOU WILL I PITY LUCY
TAKE UP THAT PITY MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE TAKE IT UP IN BOTH HANDS AS
YOU MIGHT A LITTLE CALLOW GOSLING SQUATTERING OUT OF BOUNDS WITHOUT
LEAVE PUT IT BACK IN THE WARM NEST OF A HEART WHENCE IT ISSUED AND
RECEIVE IN YOUR EAR THIS WHISPER
IF MY POLLY EVER CAME TO KNOW BY
EXPERIENCE THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF THIS WORLD'S GOODS I SHOULD LIKE
HER TO ACT AS LUCY ACTS TO WORK FOR HERSELF THAT SHE MIGHT BURDEN
NEITHER KITH NOR KIN
YES PAPA SAID SHE PENSIVELY AND TRACTABLY
BUT POOR LUCY I
THOUGHT SHE WAS A RICH LADY AND HAD RICH FRIENDS
YOU THOUGHT LIKE A LITTLE SIMPLETON
I NEVER THOUGHT SO
WHEN I HAD
TIME TO CONSIDER LUCY'S MANNER AND ASPECT WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN I SAW
SHE WAS ONE WHO HAD TO GUARD AND NOT BE GUARDED TO ACT AND NOT BE
SERVED AND THIS LOT HAS I IMAGINE HELPED HER TO AN EXPERIENCE FOR
WHICH IF SHE LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO REALIZE ITS FULL BENEFIT SHE MAY YET
BLESS PROVIDENCE
BUT THIS SCHOOL HE PURSUED CHANGING HIS TONE FROM
GRAVE TO GAY WOULD MADAME BECK ADMIT MY POLLY DO YOU THINK MISS
LUCY
I SAID THERE NEEDED BUT TO TRY MADAME IT WOULD SOON BE SEEN SHE WAS
FOND OF ENGLISH PUPILS
IF YOU SIR I ADDED WILL BUT TAKE MISS DE
BASSOMPIERRE IN YOUR CARRIAGE THIS VERY AFTERNOON I THINK I CAN ANSWER
FOR IT THAT ROSINE THE PORTRESS WILL NOT BE VERY SLOW IN ANSWERING
YOUR RING AND MADAME I AM SURE WILL PUT ON HER BEST PAIR OF GLOVES
TO COME INTO THE SALON TO RECEIVE YOU
IN THAT CASE RESPONDED MR
HOME I SEE NO SORT OF NECESSITY THERE
IS FOR DELAY
MRS
HURST CAN SEND WHAT SHE CALLS HER YOUNG LADY'S
'THINGS' AFTER HER POLLY CAN SETTLE DOWN TO HER HORN BOOK BEFORE
NIGHT AND YOU MISS LUCY I TRUST WILL NOT DISDAIN TO CAST AN
OCCASIONAL EYE UPON HER AND LET ME KNOW FROM TIME TO TIME HOW SHE
GETS ON
I HOPE YOU APPROVE OF THE ARRANGEMENT COUNTESS DE
BASSOMPIERRE
THE COUNTESS HEMMED AND HESITATED
I THOUGHT SAID SHE I THOUGHT I
HAD FINISHED MY EDUCATION
THAT ONLY PROVES HOW MUCH WE MAY BE MISTAKEN IN OUR THOUGHTS I HOLD A
FAR DIFFERENT OPINION AS MOST OF THESE WILL WHO HAVE BEEN AUDITORS OF
YOUR PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE THIS MORNING
AH MY LITTLE GIRL THOU
HAST MUCH TO LEARN AND PAPA OUGHT TO HAVE TAUGHT THEE MORE THAN HE HAS
DONE COME THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO TRY MADAME BECK AND THE
WEATHER SEEMS SETTLING AND I HAVE FINISHED MY BREAKFAST
BUT PAPA
WELL
I SEE AN OBSTACLE
I DON'T AT ALL
IT IS ENORMOUS PAPA IT CAN NEVER BE GOT OVER IT IS AS LARGE AS YOU
IN YOUR GREATCOAT AND THE SNOWDRIFT ON THE TOP
AND LIKE THAT SNOWDRIFT CAPABLE OF MELTING
NO IT IS OF TOO TOO SOLID FLESH IT IS JUST YOUR OWN SELF
MISS
LUCY WARN MADAME BECK NOT TO LISTEN TO ANY OVERTURES ABOUT TAKING ME
BECAUSE IN THE END IT WOULD TURN OUT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE PAPA
TOO AS HE IS SO TEASING I WILL JUST TELL TALES ABOUT HIM
MRS
BRETTON AND ALL OF YOU LISTEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS TWELVE
YEARS OLD HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT HE WAS SPOILING ME THAT I WAS
GROWING UNFITTED FOR THE WORLD AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT AND NOTHING
WOULD SERVE OR SATISFY HIM BUT I MUST GO TO SCHOOL
I CRIED AND SO
ON BUT M
DE BASSOMPIERRE PROVED HARD HEARTED QUITE FIRM AND FLINTY
AND TO SCHOOL I WENT
WHAT WAS THE RESULT IN THE MOST ADMIRABLE
MANNER PAPA CAME TO SCHOOL LIKEWISE EVERY OTHER DAY HE CALLED TO SEE
ME
MADAME AIGREDOUX GRUMBLED BUT IT WAS OF NO USE AND SO AT LAST
PAPA AND I WERE BOTH IN A MANNER EXPELLED
LUCY CAN JUST TELL MADAME
BECK THIS LITTLE TRAIT IT IS ONLY FAIR TO LET HER KNOW WHAT SHE HAS TO
EXPECT
MRS
BRETTON ASKED MR
HOME WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN ANSWER TO THIS
STATEMENT
AS HE MADE NO DEFENCE JUDGMENT WAS GIVEN AGAINST HIM AND
PAULINA TRIUMPHED
BUT SHE HAD OTHER MOODS BESIDES THE ARCH AND NAVE
AFTER BREAKFAST
WHEN THE TWO ELDERS WITHDREW I SUPPOSE TO TALK OVER CERTAIN OF MRS
BRETTON'S BUSINESS MATTERS AND THE COUNTESS DR
BRETTON AND I WERE
FOR A SHORT TIME ALONE TOGETHER ALL THE CHILD LEFT HER WITH US MORE
NEARLY HER COMPANIONS IN AGE SHE ROSE AT ONCE TO THE LITTLE LADY HER
VERY FACE SEEMED TO ALTER THAT PLAY OF FEATURE AND CANDOUR OF LOOK
WHICH WHEN SHE SPOKE TO HER FATHER MADE IT QUITE DIMPLED AND ROUND
YIELDED TO AN ASPECT MORE THOUGHTFUL AND LINES DISTINCTER AND LESS
MOBILE
NO DOUBT GRAHAM NOTED THE CHANGE AS WELL AS I
HE STOOD FOR SOME
MINUTES NEAR THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT AT THE SNOW PRESENTLY HE
APPROACHED THE HEARTH AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION BUT NOT QUITE
WITH HIS USUAL EASE FIT TOPICS DID NOT SEEM TO RISE TO HIS LIPS HE
CHOSE THEM FASTIDIOUSLY HESITATINGLY AND CONSEQUENTLY INFELICITOUSLY
HE SPOKE VAGUELY OF VILLETTE ITS INHABITANTS ITS NOTABLE SIGHTS AND
BUILDINGS
HE WAS ANSWERED BY MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE IN QUITE WOMANLY
SORT WITH INTELLIGENCE WITH A MANNER NOT INDEED WHOLLY
DISINDIVIDUALIZED A TONE A GLANCE A GESTURE HERE AND THERE RATHER
ANIMATED AND QUICK THAN MEASURED AND STATELY STILL RECALLED LITTLE
POLLY BUT YET THERE WAS SO FINE AND EVEN A POLISH SO CALM AND
COURTEOUS A GRACE GILDING AND SUSTAINING THESE PECULIARITIES THAT A
LESS SENSITIVE MAN THAN GRAHAM WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO SEIZE UPON
THEM AS VANTAGE POINTS LEADING TO FRANKER INTIMACY
YET WHILE DR
BRETTON CONTINUED SUBDUED AND FOR HIM SEDATE HE WAS
STILL OBSERVANT
NOT ONE OF THOSE PETTY IMPULSES AND NATURAL BREAKS
ESCAPED HIM
HE DID NOT MISS ONE CHARACTERISTIC MOVEMENT ONE
HESITATION IN LANGUAGE OR ONE LISP IN UTTERANCE
AT TIMES IN SPEAKING
FAST SHE STILL LISPED BUT COLOURED WHENEVER SUCH LAPSE OCCURRED AND
IN A PAINSTAKING CONSCIENTIOUS MANNER QUITE AS AMUSING AS THE SLIGHT
ERROR REPEATED THE WORD MORE DISTINCTLY
WHENEVER SHE DID THIS DR
BRETTON SMILED
GRADUALLY AS THEY
CONVERSED THE RESTRAINT ON EACH SIDE SLACKENED MIGHT THE CONFERENCE
HAVE BUT BEEN PROLONGED I BELIEVE IT WOULD SOON HAVE BECOME GENIAL
ALREADY TO PAULINA'S LIP AND CHEEK RETURNED THE WREATHING DIMPLING
SMILE SHE LISPED ONCE AND FORGOT TO CORRECT HERSELF
AND DR
JOHN I
KNOW NOT HOW HE CHANGED BUT CHANGE HE DID
HE DID NOT GROW GAYER NO
RAILLERY NO LEVITY SPARKLED ACROSS HIS ASPECT BUT HIS POSITION SEEMED
TO BECOME ONE OF MORE PLEASURE TO HIMSELF AND HE SPOKE HIS AUGMENTED
COMFORT IN READIER LANGUAGE IN TONES MORE SUAVE
TEN YEARS AGO THIS
PAIR HAD ALWAYS FOUND ABUNDANCE TO SAY TO EACH OTHER THE INTERVENING
DECADE HAD NOT NARROWED THE EXPERIENCE OR IMPOVERISHED THE INTELLIGENCE
OF EITHER BESIDES THERE ARE CERTAIN NATURES OF WHICH THE MUTUAL
INFLUENCE IS SUCH THAT THE MORE THEY SAY THE MORE THEY HAVE TO SAY
FOR THESE OUT OF ASSOCIATION GROWS ADHESION AND OUT OF ADHESION
AMALGAMATION
GRAHAM HOWEVER MUST GO HIS WAS A PROFESSION WHOSE CLAIMS ARE NEITHER
TO BE IGNORED NOR DEFERRED
HE LEFT THE ROOM BUT BEFORE HE COULD LEAVE
THE HOUSE THERE WAS A RETURN
I AM SURE HE CAME BACK NOT FOR THE
PAPER OR CARD IN HIS DESK WHICH FORMED HIS OSTENSIBLE ERRAND BUT TO
ASSURE HIMSELF BY ONE MORE GLANCE THAT PAULINA'S ASPECT WAS REALLY
SUCH AS MEMORY WAS BEARING AWAY THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN VIEWING HER
SOMEHOW BY A PARTIAL ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AND MAKING A FOND MISTAKE
NO
HE FOUND THE IMPRESSION TRUE RATHER INDEED HE GAINED THAN LOST BY
THIS RETURN HE TOOK AWAY WITH HIM A PARTING LOOK SHY BUT VERY
SOFT AS BEAUTIFUL AS INNOCENT AS ANY LITTLE FAWN COULD LIFT OUT OF
ITS COVER OF FERN OR ANY LAMB FROM ITS MEADOW BED
BEING LEFT ALONE PAULINA AND I KEPT SILENCE FOR SOME TIME WE BOTH
TOOK OUT SOME WORK AND PLIED A MUTE AND DILIGENT TASK
THE WHITE WOOD
WORKBOX OF OLD DAYS WAS NOW REPLACED BY ONE INLAID WITH PRECIOUS
MOSAIC AND FURNISHED WITH IMPLEMENTS OF GOLD THE TINY AND TREMBLING
FINGERS THAT COULD SCARCE GUIDE THE NEEDLE THOUGH TINY STILL WERE NOW
SWIFT AND SKILFUL BUT THERE WAS THE SAME BUSY KNITTING OF THE BROW
THE SAME LITTLE DAINTY MANNERISMS THE SAME QUICK TURNS AND
MOVEMENTS NOW TO REPLACE A STRAY TRESS AND ANON TO SHAKE FROM THE
SILKEN SKIRT SOME IMAGINARY ATOM OF DUST SOME CLINGING FIBRE OF THREAD
THAT MORNING I WAS DISPOSED FOR SILENCE THE AUSTERE FURY OF THE
WINTER DAY HAD ON ME AN AWING HUSHING INFLUENCE
THAT PASSION OF
JANUARY SO WHITE AND SO BLOODLESS WAS NOT YET SPENT THE STORM HAD
RAVED ITSELF HOARSE BUT SEEMED NO NEARER EXHAUSTION
HAD GINEVRA
FANSHAWE BEEN MY COMPANION IN THAT DRAWING ROOM SHE WOULD NOT HAVE
SUFFERED ME TO MUSE AND LISTEN UNDISTURBED
THE PRESENCE JUST GONE FROM
US WOULD HAVE BEEN HER THEME AND HOW SHE WOULD HAVE RUNG THE CHANGES
ON ONE TOPIC HOW SHE WOULD HAVE PURSUED AND PESTERED ME WITH QUESTIONS
AND SURMISES WORRIED AND OPPRESSED ME WITH COMMENTS AND CONFIDENCES I
DID NOT WANT AND LONGED TO AVOID
PAULINA MARY CAST ONCE OR TWICE TOWARDS ME A QUIET BUT PENETRATING
GLANCE OF HER DARK FULL EYE HER LIPS HALF OPENED AS IF TO THE
IMPULSE OF COMING UTTERANCE BUT SHE SAW AND DELICATELY RESPECTED MY
INCLINATION FOR SILENCE
THIS WILL NOT HOLD LONG I THOUGHT TO MYSELF FOR I WAS NOT
ACCUSTOMED TO FIND IN WOMEN OR GIRLS ANY POWER OF SELF CONTROL OR
STRENGTH OF SELF DENIAL
AS FAR AS I KNEW THEM THE CHANCE OF A GOSSIP
ABOUT THEIR USUALLY TRIVIAL SECRETS THEIR OFTEN VERY WASHY AND PALTRY
FEELINGS WAS A TREAT NOT TO BE READILY FOREGONE
THE LITTLE COUNTESS PROMISED AN EXCEPTION SHE SEWED TILL SHE WAS TIRED
OF SEWING AND THEN SHE TOOK A BOOK
AS CHANCE WOULD HAVE IT SHE HAD SOUGHT IT IN DR
BRETTON'S OWN
COMPARTMENT OF THE BOOKCASE AND IT PROVED TO BE AN OLD BRETTON
BOOK SOME ILLUSTRATED WORK OF NATURAL HISTORY
OFTEN HAD I SEEN HER
STANDING AT GRAHAM'S SIDE RESTING THAT VOLUME ON HIS KNEE AND READING
TO HIS TUITION AND WHEN THE LESSON WAS OVER BEGGING AS A TREAT
THAT HE WOULD TELL HER ALL ABOUT THE PICTURES
I WATCHED HER KEENLY
HERE WAS A TRUE TEST OF THAT MEMORY SHE HAD BOASTED WOULD HER
RECOLLECTIONS NOW BE FAITHFUL
FAITHFUL IT COULD NOT BE DOUBTED
AS SHE TURNED THE LEAVES OVER HER
FACE PASSED GLEAM AFTER GLEAM OF EXPRESSION THE LEAST INTELLIGENT OF
WHICH WAS A FULL GREETING TO THE PAST
AND THEN SHE TURNED TO THE
TITLE PAGE AND LOOKED AT THE NAME WRITTEN IN THE SCHOOLBOY HAND
SHE
LOOKED AT IT LONG NOR WAS SHE SATISFIED WITH MERELY LOOKING SHE
GENTLY PASSED OVER THE CHARACTERS THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS ACCOMPANYING
THE ACTION WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS BUT TENDER SMILE WHICH CONVERTED THE
TOUCH INTO A CARESS
PAULINA LOVED THE PAST BUT THE PECULIARITY OF
THIS LITTLE SCENE WAS THAT SHE SAID NOTHING SHE COULD FEEL WITHOUT
POURING OUT HER FEELINGS IN A FLUX OF WORDS
SHE NOW OCCUPIED HERSELF AT THE BOOKCASE FOR NEARLY AN HOUR TAKING
DOWN VOLUME AFTER VOLUME AND RENEWING HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH EACH
THIS
DONE SHE SEATED HERSELF ON A LOW STOOL RESTED HER CHEEK ON HER HAND
AND THOUGHT AND STILL WAS MUTE
THE SOUND OF THE FRONT DOOR OPENED BELOW A RUSH OF COLD WIND AND HER
FATHER'S VOICE SPEAKING TO MRS
BRETTON IN THE HALL STARTLED HER AT
LAST
SHE SPRANG UP SHE WAS DOWN STAIRS IN ONE SECOND
PAPA PAPA YOU ARE NOT GOING OUT
MY PET I MUST GO INTO TOWN
BUT IT IS TOO TOO COLD PAPA
AND THEN I HEARD M
DE BASSOMPIERRE SHOWING TO HER HOW HE WAS WELL
PROVIDED AGAINST THE WEATHER AND HOW HE WAS GOING TO HAVE THE
CARRIAGE AND TO BE QUITE SNUGLY SHELTERED AND IN SHORT PROVING THAT
SHE NEED NOT FEAR FOR HIS COMFORT
BUT YOU WILL PROMISE TO COME BACK HERE THIS EVENING BEFORE IT IS
QUITE DARK YOU AND DR
BRETTON BOTH IN THE CARRIAGE IT IS NOT FIT
TO RIDE
WELL IF I SEE THE DOCTOR I WILL TELL HIM A LADY HAS LAID ON HIM HER
COMMANDS TO TAKE CARE OF HIS PRECIOUS HEALTH AND COME HOME EARLY UNDER
MY ESCORT
YES YOU MUST SAY A LADY AND HE WILL THINK IT IS HIS MOTHER AND BE
OBEDIENT AND PAPA MIND TO COME SOON FOR I SHALL WATCH AND LISTEN
THE DOOR CLOSED AND THE CARRIAGE ROLLED SOFTLY THROUGH THE SNOW AND
BACK RETURNED THE COUNTESS PENSIVE AND ANXIOUS
SHE DID LISTEN AND WATCH WHEN EVENING CLOSED BUT IT WAS IN
STILLEST SORT WALKING THE DRAWING ROOM WITH QUITE NOISELESS STEP
SHE
CHECKED AT INTERVALS HER VELVET MARCH INCLINED HER EAR AND CONSULTED
THE NIGHT SOUNDS I SHOULD RATHER SAY THE NIGHT SILENCE FOR NOW AT
LAST THE WIND WAS FALLEN
THE SKY RELIEVED OF ITS AVALANCHE LAY
NAKED AND PALE THROUGH THE BARREN BOUGHS OF THE AVENUE WE COULD SEE IT
WELL AND NOTE ALSO THE POLAR SPLENDOUR OF THE NEW YEAR MOON AN ORB
WHITE AS A WORLD OF ICE
NOR WAS IT LATE WHEN WE SAW ALSO THE RETURN OF
THE CARRIAGE
PAULINA HAD NO DANCE OF WELCOME FOR THIS EVENING
IT WAS WITH A SORT OF
GRAVITY THAT SHE TOOK IMMEDIATE POSSESSION OF HER FATHER AS HE ENTERED
THE ROOM BUT SHE AT ONCE MADE HIM HER ENTIRE PROPERTY LED HIM TO THE
SEAT OF HER CHOICE AND WHILE SOFTLY SHOWERING ROUND HIM HONEYED WORDS
OF COMMENDATION FOR BEING SO GOOD AND COMING HOME SO SOON YOU WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS ENTIRELY BY THE POWER OF HER LITTLE HANDS HE WAS
PUT INTO HIS CHAIR AND SETTLED AND ARRANGED FOR THE STRONG MAN SEEMED
TO TAKE PLEASURE IN WHOLLY YIELDING HIMSELF TO THIS DOMINION POTENT
ONLY BY LOVE
GRAHAM DID NOT APPEAR TILL SOME MINUTES AFTER THE COUNT
PAULINA HALF
TURNED WHEN HIS STEP WAS HEARD THEY SPOKE BUT ONLY A WORD OR TWO
THEIR FINGERS MET A MOMENT BUT OBVIOUSLY WITH SLIGHT CONTACT
PAULINA
REMAINED BESIDE HER FATHER GRAHAM THREW HIMSELF INTO A SEAT ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM
IT WAS WELL THAT MRS
BRETTON AND MR
HOME HAD A GREAT DEAL TO SAY TO
EACH OTHER ALMOST AN INEXHAUSTIBLE FUND OF DISCOURSE IN OLD
RECOLLECTIONS OTHERWISE I THINK OUR PARTY WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT A
STILL ONE THAT EVENING
AFTER TEA PAULINA'S QUICK NEEDLE AND PRETTY GOLDEN THIMBLE WERE BUSILY
PLIED BY THE LAMP LIGHT BUT HER TONGUE RESTED AND HER EYES SEEMED
RELUCTANT TO RAISE OFTEN THEIR LIDS SO SMOOTH AND SO FULL FRINGED
GRAHAM TOO MUST HAVE BEEN TIRED WITH HIS DAY'S WORK HE LISTENED
DUTIFULLY TO HIS ELDERS AND BETTERS SAID VERY LITTLE HIMSELF AND
FOLLOWED WITH HIS EYE THE GILDED GLANCE OF PAULINA'S THIMBLE AS IF IT
HAD BEEN SOME BRIGHT MOTH ON THE WING OR THE GOLDEN HEAD OF SOME
DARTING LITTLE YELLOW SERPENT
CHAPTER XXVI
A BURIAL
FROM THIS DATE MY LIFE DID NOT WANT VARIETY I WENT OUT A GOOD DEAL
WITH THE ENTIRE CONSENT OF MADAME BECK WHO PERFECTLY APPROVED THE
GRADE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE
THAT WORTHY DIRECTRESS HAD NEVER FROM THE
FIRST TREATED ME OTHERWISE THAN WITH RESPECT AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT I
WAS LIABLE TO FREQUENT INVITATIONS FROM A CHTEAU AND A GREAT HOTEL
RESPECT IMPROVED INTO DISTINCTION
NOT THAT SHE WAS FULSOME ABOUT IT MADAME IN ALL THINGS WORLDLY WAS
IN NOTHING WEAK THERE WAS MEASURE AND SENSE IN HER HOTTEST PURSUIT OF
SELF INTEREST CALM AND CONSIDERATENESS IN HER CLOSEST CLUTCH OF GAIN
WITHOUT THEN LAYING HERSELF OPEN TO MY CONTEMPT AS A TIME SERVER AND
A TOADIE SHE MARKED WITH TACT THAT SHE WAS PLEASED PEOPLE CONNECTED
WITH HER ESTABLISHMENT SHOULD FREQUENT SUCH ASSOCIATES AS MUST
CULTIVATE AND ELEVATE RATHER THAN THOSE WHO MIGHT DETERIORATE AND
DEPRESS
SHE NEVER PRAISED EITHER ME OR MY FRIENDS ONLY ONCE WHEN SHE
WAS SITTING IN THE SUN IN THE GARDEN A CUP OF COFFEE AT HER ELBOW AND
THE GAZETTE IN HER HAND LOOKING VERY COMFORTABLE AND I CAME UP AND
ASKED LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR THE EVENING SHE DELIVERED HERSELF IN THIS
GRACIOUS SORT
OUI OUI MA BONNE AMIE JE VOUS DONNE LA PERMISSION DE COEUR ET DE
GR
VOTRE TRAVAIL DANS MA MAISON A TOUJOURS T ADMIRABLE REMPLI DE
ZLE ET DE DISCRTION VOUS AVEZ BIEN LE DROIT DE VOUS AMUSER
SORTEZ
DONC TANT QUE VOUS VOUDREZ
QUANT VOTRE CHOIX DE CONNAISSANCES J'EN
SUIS CONTENTE C'EST SAGE DIGNE LAUDABLE
SHE CLOSED HER LIPS AND RESUMED THE GAZETTE
THE READER WILL NOT TOO GRAVELY REGARD THE LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT
ABOUT THIS TIME THE TRIPLY ENCLOSED PACKET OF FIVE LETTERS TEMPORARILY
DISAPPEARED FROM MY BUREAU
BLANK DISMAY WAS NATURALLY MY FIRST
SENSATION ON MAKING THE DISCOVERY BUT IN A MOMENT I TOOK HEART OF
GRACE
PATIENCE WHISPERED I TO MYSELF
LET ME SAY NOTHING BUT WAIT
PEACEABLY THEY WILL COME BACK AGAIN
AND THEY DID COME BACK THEY HAD ONLY BEEN ON A SHORT VISIT TO MADAME'S
CHAMBER HAVING PASSED THEIR EXAMINATION THEY CAME BACK DULY AND
TRULY I FOUND THEM ALL RIGHT THE NEXT DAY
I WONDER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF MY CORRESPONDENCE WHAT ESTIMATE DID SHE
FORM OF DR
JOHN BRETTON'S EPISTOLARY POWERS IN WHAT LIGHT DID THE
OFTEN VERY PITHY THOUGHTS THE GENERALLY SOUND AND SOMETIMES ORIGINAL
OPINIONS SET WITHOUT PRETENSION IN AN EASILY FLOWING SPIRITED
STYLE APPEAR TO HER HOW DID SHE LIKE THAT GENIAL HALF HUMOROUS VEIN
WHICH TO ME GAVE SUCH DELIGHT WHAT DID SHE THINK OF THE FEW KIND WORDS
SCATTERED HERE AND THERE NOT THICKLY AS THE DIAMONDS WERE SCATTERED IN
THE VALLEY OF SINDBAD BUT SPARELY AS THOSE GEMS LIE IN UNFABLED BEDS
OH MADAME BECK HOW SEEMED THESE THINGS TO YOU
I THINK IN MADAME BECK'S EYES THE FIVE LETTERS FOUND A CERTAIN FAVOUR
ONE DAY AFTER SHE HAD BORROWED THEM OF ME IN SPEAKING OF SO SUAVE A
LITTLE WOMAN ONE OUGHT TO USE SUAVE TERMS I CAUGHT HER EXAMINING ME
WITH A STEADY CONTEMPLATIVE GAZE A LITTLE PUZZLED BUT NOT AT ALL
MALEVOLENT
IT WAS DURING THAT BRIEF SPACE BETWEEN LESSONS WHEN THE
PUPILS TURNED OUT INTO THE COURT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S RECREATION
SHE AND I REMAINED IN THE FIRST CLASSE ALONE WHEN I MET HER EYE HER
THOUGHTS FORCED THEMSELVES PARTIALLY THROUGH HER LIPS
IL Y A SAID SHE QUELQUECHOSE DE BIEN REMARQUABLE DANS LE CARACTRE
ANGLAIS
HOW MADAME
SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH REPEATING THE WORD HOW IN ENGLISH
JE NE SAURAIS VOUS DIRE 'HOW MAIS ENFIN LES ANGLAIS ONT DES IDES
EUX EN AMITI EN AMOUR EN TOUT
MAIS AU MOINS IL N'EST PAS BESOIN
DE LES SURVEILLER SHE ADDED GETTING UP AND TROTTING AWAY LIKE THE
COMPACT LITTLE PONY SHE WAS
THEN I HOPE MURMURED I TO MYSELF YOU WILL GRACIOUSLY LET ALONE MY
LETTERS FOR THE FUTURE
ALAS SOMETHING CAME RUSHING INTO MY EYES DIMMING UTTERLY THEIR
VISION BLOTTING FROM SIGHT THE SCHOOLROOM THE GARDEN THE BRIGHT
WINTER SUN AS I REMEMBERED THAT NEVER MORE WOULD LETTERS SUCH AS SHE
HAD READ COME TO ME
I HAD SEEN THE LAST OF THEM
THAT GOODLY RIVER ON
WHOSE BANKS I HAD SOJOURNED OF WHOSE WAVES A FEW REVIVING DROPS HAD
TRICKLED TO MY LIPS WAS BENDING TO ANOTHER COURSE IT WAS LEAVING MY
LITTLE HUT AND FIELD FORLORN AND SAND DRY POURING ITS WEALTH OF WATERS
FAR AWAY
THE CHANGE WAS RIGHT JUST NATURAL NOT A WORD COULD BE
SAID BUT I LOVED MY RHINE MY NILE I HAD ALMOST WORSHIPPED MY GANGES
AND I GRIEVED THAT THE GRAND TIDE SHOULD ROLL ESTRANGED SHOULD VANISH
LIKE A FALSE MIRAGE
THOUGH STOICAL I WAS NOT QUITE A STOIC DROPS
STREAMED FAST ON MY HANDS ON MY DESK I WEPT ONE SULTRY SHOWER HEAVY
AND BRIEF
BUT SOON I SAID TO MYSELF THE HOPE I AM BEMOANING SUFFERED AND MADE
ME SUFFER MUCH IT DID NOT DIE TILL IT WAS FULL TIME FOLLOWING AN
AGONY SO LINGERING DEATH OUGHT TO BE WELCOME
WELCOME I ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE IT
INDEED LONG PAIN HAD MADE PATIENCE A
HABIT
IN THE END I CLOSED THE EYES OF MY DEAD COVERED ITS FACE AND
COMPOSED ITS LIMBS WITH GREAT CALM
THE LETTERS HOWEVER MUST BE PUT AWAY OUT OF SIGHT PEOPLE WHO HAVE
UNDERGONE BEREAVEMENT ALWAYS JEALOUSLY GATHER TOGETHER AND LOCK AWAY
MEMENTOS IT IS NOT SUPPORTABLE TO BE STABBED TO THE HEART EACH MOMENT
BY SHARP REVIVAL OF REGRET
ONE VACANT HOLIDAY AFTERNOON THE THURSDAY GOING TO MY TREASURE WITH
INTENT TO CONSIDER ITS FINAL DISPOSAL I PERCEIVED AND THIS TIME WITH
A STRONG IMPULSE OF DISPLEASURE THAT IT HAD BEEN AGAIN TAMPERED WITH
THE PACKET WAS THERE INDEED BUT THE RIBBON WHICH SECURED IT HAD BEEN
UNTIED AND RETIED AND BY OTHER SYMPTOMS I KNEW THAT MY DRAWER HAD BEEN
VISITED
THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH
MADAME BECK HERSELF WAS THE SOUL OF
DISCRETION BESIDES HAVING AS STRONG A BRAIN AND SOUND A JUDGMENT AS
EVER FURNISHED A HUMAN HEAD THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE CONTENTS OF MY
CASKET WAS NOT PLEASANT BUT MIGHT BE BORNE
LITTLE JESUIT
INQUISITRESS AS SHE WAS SHE COULD SEE THINGS IN A TRUE LIGHT AND
UNDERSTAND THEM IN AN UNPERVERTED SENSE BUT THE IDEA THAT SHE HAD
VENTURED TO COMMUNICATE INFORMATION THUS GAINED TO OTHERS THAT SHE
HAD PERHAPS AMUSED HERSELF WITH A COMPANION OVER DOCUMENTS IN MY
EYES MOST SACRED SHOCKED ME CRUELLY
YET THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE I NOW
SAW REASON TO FEAR I EVEN GUESSED HER CONFIDANT
HER KINSMAN M
PAUL
EMANUEL HAD SPENT YESTERDAY EVENING WITH HER SHE WAS MUCH IN THE
HABIT OF CONSULTING HIM AND OF DISCUSSING WITH HIM MATTERS SHE
BROACHED TO NO ONE ELSE
THIS VERY MORNING IN CLASS THAT GENTLEMAN
HAD FAVOURED ME WITH A GLANCE WHICH HE SEEMED TO HAVE BORROWED FROM
VASHTI THE ACTRESS I HAD NOT AT THE MOMENT COMPREHENDED THAT BLUE
YET LURID FLASH OUT OF HIS ANGRY EYE BUT I READ ITS MEANING NOW
HE I BELIEVED WAS NOT APT TO REGARD WHAT CONCERNED ME FROM A FAIR
POINT OF VIEW NOR TO JUDGE ME WITH TOLERANCE AND CANDOUR I HAD ALWAYS
FOUND HIM SEVERE AND SUSPICIOUS THE THOUGHT THAT THESE LETTERS MERE
FRIENDLY LETTERS AS THEY WERE HAD FALLEN ONCE AND MIGHT FALL AGAIN
INTO HIS HANDS JARRED MY VERY SOUL
WHAT SHOULD I DO TO PREVENT THIS IN WHAT CORNER OF THIS STRANGE HOUSE
WAS IT POSSIBLE TO FIND SECURITY OR SECRESY WHERE COULD A KEY BE A
SAFEGUARD OR A PADLOCK A BARRIER
IN THE GRENIER NO I DID NOT LIKE THE GRENIER
BESIDES MOST OF THE
BOXES AND DRAWERS THERE WERE MOULDERING AND DID NOT LOCK
RATS TOO
GNAWED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE DECAYED WOOD AND MICE MADE NESTS AMONGST
THE LITTER OF THEIR CONTENTS MY DEAR LETTERS MOST DEAR STILL THOUGH
ICHABOD WAS WRITTEN ON THEIR COVERS MIGHT BE CONSUMED BY VERMIN
CERTAINLY THE WRITING WOULD SOON BECOME OBLITERATED BY DAMP
NO THE
GRENIER WOULD NOT DO BUT WHERE THEN
WHILE PONDERING THIS PROBLEM I SAT IN THE DORMITORY WINDOW SEAT
IT
WAS A FINE FROSTY AFTERNOON THE WINTER SUN ALREADY SETTING GLEAMED
PALE ON THE TOPS OF THE GARDEN SHRUBS IN THE ALLE DFENDUE ONE
GREAT OLD PEAR TREE THE NUN'S PEAR TREE STOOD UP A TALL DRYAD
SKELETON GREY GAUNT AND STRIPPED
A THOUGHT STRUCK ME ONE OF THOSE
QUEER FANTASTIC THOUGHTS THAT WILL SOMETIMES STRIKE SOLITARY PEOPLE
I
PUT ON MY BONNET CLOAK AND FURS AND WENT OUT INTO THE CITY
BENDING MY STEPS TO THE OLD HISTORICAL QUARTER OF THE TOWN WHOSE HOAX
AND OVERSHADOWED PRECINCTS I ALWAYS SOUGHT BY INSTINCT IN MELANCHOLY
MOODS I WANDERED ON FROM STREET TO STREET TILL HAVING CROSSED A HALF
DESERTED PLACE OR SQUARE I FOUND MYSELF BEFORE A SORT OF BROKER'S
SHOP AN ANCIENT PLACE FULL OF ANCIENT THINGS
WHAT I WANTED WAS A
METAL BOX WHICH MIGHT BE SOLDERED OR A THICK GLASS JAR OR BOTTLE WHICH
MIGHT BE STOPPERED OR SEALED HERMETICALLY
AMONGST MISCELLANEOUS HEAPS
I FOUND AND PURCHASED THE LATTER ARTICLE
I THEN MADE A LITTLE ROLL OF MY LETTERS WRAPPED THEM IN OILED SILK
BOUND THEM WITH TWINE AND HAVING PUT THEM IN THE BOTTLE GOT THE OLD
JEW BROKER TO STOPPER SEAL AND MAKE IT AIR TIGHT
WHILE OBEYING MY
DIRECTIONS HE GLANCED AT ME NOW AND THEN SUSPICIOUSLY FROM UNDER HIS
FROST WHITE EYELASHES
I BELIEVE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME EVIL DEED ON
HAND
IN ALL THIS I HAD A DREARY SOMETHING NOT PLEASURE BUT A SAD
LONELY SATISFACTION
THE IMPULSE UNDER WHICH I ACTED THE MOOD
CONTROLLING ME WERE SIMILAR TO THE IMPULSE AND THE MOOD WHICH HAD
INDUCED ME TO VISIT THE CONFESSIONAL
WITH QUICK WALKING I REGAINED THE
PENSIONNAT JUST AT DARK AND IN TIME FOR DINNER
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE MOON ROSE
AT HALF PAST SEVEN WHEN THE PUPILS AND
TEACHERS WERE AT STUDY AND MADAME BECK WAS WITH HER MOTHER AND
CHILDREN IN THE SALLE MANGER WHEN THE HALF BOARDERS WERE ALL GONE
HOME AND ROSINE HAD LEFT THE VESTIBULE AND ALL WAS STILL I SHAWLED
MYSELF AND TAKING THE SEALED JAR STOLE OUT THROUGH THE FIRST CLASSE
DOOR INTO THE BERCEAU AND THENCE INTO THE ALLE DFENDUE
METHUSALEH THE PEAR TREE STOOD AT THE FURTHER END OF THIS WALK NEAR
MY SEAT HE ROSE UP DIM AND GRAY ABOVE THE LOWER SHRUBS ROUND HIM
NOW METHUSALEH THOUGH SO VERY OLD WAS OF SOUND TIMBER STILL ONLY
THERE WAS A HOLE OR RATHER A DEEP HOLLOW NEAR HIS ROOT
I KNEW THERE
WAS SUCH A HOLLOW HIDDEN PARTLY BY IVY AND CREEPERS GROWING THICK
ROUND AND THERE I MEDITATED HIDING MY TREASURE
BUT I WAS NOT ONLY
GOING TO HIDE A TREASURE I MEANT ALSO TO BURY A GRIEF
THAT GRIEF OVER
WHICH I HAD LATELY BEEN WEEPING AS I WRAPPED IT IN ITS WINDING SHEET
MUST BE INTERRED
WELL I CLEARED AWAY THE IVY AND FOUND THE HOLE IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH
TO RECEIVE THE JAR AND I THRUST IT DEEP IN
IN A TOOL SHED AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN LAY THE RELICS OF BUILDING MATERIALS LEFT BY
MASONS LATELY EMPLOYED TO REPAIR A PART OF THE PREMISES
I FETCHED
THENCE A SLATE AND SOME MORTAR PUT THE SLATE ON THE HOLLOW SECURED IT
WITH CEMENT COVERED THE HOLE WITH BLACK MOULD AND FINALLY REPLACED
THE IVY
THIS DONE I RESTED LEANING AGAINST THE TREE LINGERING LIKE
ANY OTHER MOURNER BESIDE A NEWLY SODDED GRAVE
THE AIR OF THE NIGHT WAS VERY STILL BUT DIM WITH A PECULIAR MIST
WHICH CHANGED THE MOONLIGHT INTO A LUMINOUS HAZE
IN THIS AIR OR THIS
MIST THERE WAS SOME QUALITY ELECTRICAL PERHAPS WHICH ACTED IN
STRANGE SORT UPON ME
I FELT THEN AS I HAD FELT A YEAR AGO IN
ENGLAND ON A NIGHT WHEN THE AURORA BOREALIS WAS STREAMING AND SWEEPING
ROUND HEAVEN WHEN BELATED IN LONELY FIELDS I HAD PAUSED TO WATCH
THAT MUSTERING OF AN ARMY WITH BANNERS THAT QUIVERING OF SERRIED
LANCES THAT SWIFT ASCENT OF MESSENGERS FROM BELOW THE NORTH STAR TO
THE DARK HIGH KEYSTONE OF HEAVEN'S ARCH
I FELT NOT HAPPY FAR
OTHERWISE BUT STRONG WITH REINFORCED STRENGTH
IF LIFE BE A WAR IT SEEMED MY DESTINY TO CONDUCT IT SINGLE HANDED
I
PONDERED NOW HOW TO BREAK UP MY WINTER QUARTERS TO LEAVE AN ENCAMPMENT
WHERE FOOD AND FORAGE FAILED
PERHAPS TO EFFECT THIS CHANGE ANOTHER
PITCHED BATTLE MUST BE FOUGHT WITH FORTUNE IF SO I HAD A MIND TO THE
ENCOUNTER TOO POOR TO LOSE GOD MIGHT DESTINE ME TO GAIN
BUT WHAT
ROAD WAS OPEN WHAT PLAN AVAILABLE
ON THIS QUESTION I WAS STILL PAUSING WHEN THE MOON SO DIM HITHERTO
SEEMED TO SHINE OUT SOMEWHAT BRIGHTER A RAY GLEAMED EVEN WHITE BEFORE
ME AND A SHADOW BECAME DISTINCT AND MARKED
I LOOKED MORE NARROWLY TO
MAKE OUT THE CAUSE OF THIS WELL DEFINED CONTRAST APPEARING A LITTLE
SUDDENLY IN THE OBSCURE ALLEY WHITER AND BLACKER IT GREW ON MY EYE IT
TOOK SHAPE WITH INSTANTANEOUS TRANSFORMATION
I STOOD ABOUT THREE YARDS
FROM A TALL SABLE ROBED SNOWY VEILED WOMAN
FIVE MINUTES PASSED
I NEITHER FLED NOR SHRIEKED
SHE WAS THERE STILL
I SPOKE
WHO ARE YOU AND WHY DO YOU COME TO ME
SHE STOOD MUTE
SHE HAD NO FACE NO FEATURES ALL BELOW HER BROW WAS
MASKED WITH A WHITE CLOTH BUT SHE HAD EYES AND THEY VIEWED ME
I FELT IF NOT BRAVE YET A LITTLE DESPERATE AND DESPERATION WILL
OFTEN SUFFICE TO FILL THE POST AND DO THE WORK OF COURAGE
I ADVANCED
ONE STEP
I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND FOR I MEANT TO TOUCH HER
SHE SEEMED
TO RECEDE
I DREW NEARER HER RECESSION STILL SILENT BECAME SWIFT
A
MASS OF SHRUBS FULL LEAVED EVERGREENS LAUREL AND DENSE YEW
INTERVENED BETWEEN ME AND WHAT I FOLLOWED
HAVING PASSED THAT OBSTACLE
I LOOKED AND SAW NOTHING
I WAITED
I SAID IF YOU HAVE ANY ERRAND TO
MEN COME BACK AND DELIVER IT NOTHING SPOKE OR RE APPEARED
THIS TIME THERE WAS NO DR
JOHN TO WHOM TO HAVE RECOURSE THERE WAS NO
ONE TO WHOM I DARED WHISPER THE WORDS I HAVE AGAIN SEEN THE NUN
PAULINA MARY SOUGHT MY FREQUENT PRESENCE IN THE RUE CRCY
IN THE OLD
BRETTON DAYS THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER PROFESSED HERSELF FOND OF ME MY
SOCIETY HAD SOON BECOME TO HER A SORT OF UNCONSCIOUS NECESSARY
I USED
TO NOTICE THAT IF I WITHDREW TO MY ROOM SHE WOULD SPEEDILY COME
TROTTING AFTER ME AND OPENING THE DOOR AND PEEPING IN SAY WITH HER
LITTLE PEREMPTORY ACCENT COME DOWN
WHY DO YOU SIT HERE BY YOURSELF
YOU MUST COME INTO THE PARLOUR
IN THE SAME SPIRIT SHE URGED ME NOW LEAVE THE RUE FOSSETTE SHE
SAID AND COME AND LIVE WITH US
PAPA WOULD GIVE YOU FAR MORE THAN
MADAME BECK GIVES YOU
MR
HOME HIMSELF OFFERED ME A HANDSOME SUM THRICE MY PRESENT
SALARY IF I WOULD ACCEPT THE OFFICE OF COMPANION TO HIS DAUGHTER
I
DECLINED
I THINK I SHOULD HAVE DECLINED HAD I BEEN POORER THAN I WAS
AND WITH SCANTIER FUND OF RESOURCE MORE STINTED NARROWNESS OF FUTURE
PROSPECT
I HAD NOT THAT VOCATION
I COULD TEACH I COULD GIVE LESSONS
BUT TO BE EITHER A PRIVATE GOVERNESS OR A COMPANION WAS UNNATURAL TO
ME
RATHER THAN FILL THE FORMER POST IN ANY GREAT HOUSE I WOULD
DELIBERATELY HAVE TAKEN A HOUSEMAID'S PLACE BOUGHT A STRONG PAIR OF
GLOVES SWEPT BEDROOMS AND STAIRCASES AND CLEANED STOVES AND LOCKS IN
PEACE AND INDEPENDENCE
RATHER THAN BE A COMPANION I WOULD HAVE MADE
SHIRTS AND STARVED
I WAS NO BRIGHT LADY'S SHADOW NOT MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE'S
OVERCAST
ENOUGH IT WAS MY NATURE OFTEN TO BE OF A SUBDUED HABIT I WAS BUT THE
DIMNESS AND DEPRESSION MUST BOTH BE VOLUNTARY SUCH AS KEPT ME DOCILE
AT MY DESK IN THE MIDST OF MY NOW WELL ACCUSTOMED PUPILS IN MADAME
BECK'S FIST CLASSE OR ALONE AT MY OWN BEDSIDE IN HER DORMITORY OR
IN THE ALLEY AND SEAT WHICH WERE CALLED MINE IN HER GARDEN MY
QUALIFICATIONS WERE NOT CONVERTIBLE NOR ADAPTABLE THEY COULD NOT BE
MADE THE FOIL OF ANY GEM THE ADJUNCT OF ANY BEAUTY THE APPENDAGE OF
ANY GREATNESS IN CHRISTENDOM
MADAME BECK AND I WITHOUT ASSIMILATING
UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER WELL
I WAS NOT HER COMPANION NOR HER
CHILDREN'S GOVERNESS SHE LEFT ME FREE SHE TIED ME TO NOTHING NOT TO
HERSELF NOT EVEN TO HER INTERESTS ONCE WHEN SHE HAD FOR A FORTNIGHT
BEEN CALLED FROM HOME BY A NEAR RELATION'S ILLNESS AND ON HER RETURN
ALL ANXIOUS AND FULL OF CARE ABOUT HER ESTABLISHMENT LEST SOMETHING IN
HER ABSENCE SHOULD HAVE GONE WRONG FINDING THAT MATTERS HAD PROCEEDED
MUCH AS USUAL AND THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF GLARING NEGLECT SHE
MADE EACH OF THE TEACHERS A PRESENT IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF STEADINESS
TO MY BEDSIDE SHE CAME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND TOLD ME SHE HAD
NO PRESENT FOR ME I MUST MAKE FIDELITY ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE ST
PIERRE SAID SHE IF I ATTEMPT TO MAKE IT ADVANTAGEOUS TO YOU THERE
WILL ARISE MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US PERHAPS SEPARATION
ONE THING
HOWEVER I CAN DO TO PLEASE YOU LEAVE YOU ALONE WITH YOUR LIBERTY
C'EST CE QUE JE FERAI SHE KEPT HER WORD
EVERY SLIGHT SHACKLE SHE HAD
EVER LAID ON ME SHE FROM THAT TIME WITH QUIET HAND REMOVED
THUS I
HAD PLEASURE IN VOLUNTARILY RESPECTING HER RULES GRATIFICATION IN
DEVOTING DOUBLE TIME IN TAKING DOUBLE PAINS WITH THE PUPILS SHE
COMMITTED TO MY CHARGE
AS TO MARY DE BASSOMPIERRE I VISITED HER WITH PLEASURE THOUGH I WOULD
NOT LIVE WITH HER
MY VISITS SOON TAUGHT ME THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY EVEN
MY OCCASIONAL AND VOLUNTARY SOCIETY WOULD LONG BE INDISPENSABLE TO HER
M
DE BASSOMPIERRE FOR HIS PART SEEMED IMPERVIOUS TO THIS CONJECTURE
BLIND TO THIS POSSIBILITY UNCONSCIOUS AS ANY CHILD TO THE SIGNS THE
LIKELIHOODS THE FITFUL BEGINNINGS OF WHAT WHEN IT DREW TO AN END HE
MIGHT NOT APPROVE
WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD CORDIALLY APPROVE I USED TO SPECULATE
DIFFICULT TO SAY
HE WAS MUCH TAKEN UP WITH SCIENTIFIC INTERESTS KEEN
INTENT AND SOMEWHAT OPPUGNANT IN WHAT CONCERNED HIS FAVOURITE
PURSUITS BUT UNSUSPICIOUS AND TRUSTFUL IN THE ORDINARY AFFAIRS OF
LIFE
FROM ALL I COULD GATHER HE SEEMED TO REGARD HIS DAUGHTERLING
AS STILL BUT A CHILD AND PROBABLY HAD NOT YET ADMITTED THE NOTION THAT
OTHERS MIGHT LOOK ON HER IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT HE WOULD SPEAK OF WHAT
SHOULD BE DONE WHEN POLLY WAS A WOMAN WHEN SHE SHOULD BE GROWN UP
AND POLLY STANDING BESIDE HIS CHAIR WOULD SOMETIMES SMILE AND TAKE
HIS HONOURED HEAD BETWEEN HER LITTLE HANDS AND KISS HIS IRON GREY
LOCKS AND AT OTHER TIMES SHE WOULD POUT AND TOSS HER CURLS BUT SHE
NEVER SAID PAPA I AM GROWN UP
SHE HAD DIFFERENT MOODS FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE
WITH HER FATHER SHE
REALLY WAS STILL A CHILD OR CHILD LIKE AFFECTIONATE MERRY AND
PLAYFUL
WITH ME SHE WAS SERIOUS AND AS WOMANLY AS THOUGHT AND FEELING
COULD MAKE HER
WITH MRS
BRETTON SHE WAS DOCILE AND RELIANT BUT NOT
EXPANSIVE
WITH GRAHAM SHE WAS SHY AT PRESENT VERY SHY AT MOMENTS SHE
TRIED TO BE COLD ON OCCASION SHE ENDEAVOURED TO SHUN HIM
HIS STEP
MADE HER START HIS ENTRANCE HUSHED HER WHEN HE SPOKE HER ANSWERS
FAILED OF FLUENCY WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE SHE REMAINED SELF VEXED AND
DISCONCERTED
EVEN HER FATHER NOTICED THIS DEMEANOUR IN HER
MY LITTLE POLLY HE SAID ONCE YOU LIVE TOO RETIRED A LIFE IF YOU
GROW TO BE A WOMAN WITH THESE SHY MANNERS YOU WILL HARDLY BE FITTED
FOR SOCIETY
YOU REALLY MAKE QUITE A STRANGER OF DR
BRETTON HOW IS
THIS DON'T YOU REMEMBER THAT AS A LITTLE GIRL YOU USED TO BE RATHER
PARTIAL TO HIM
RATHER PAPA ECHOED SHE WITH HER SLIGHTLY DRY YET GENTLE AND
SIMPLE TONE
AND YOU DON'T LIKE HIM NOW WHAT HAS HE DONE
NOTHING
Y E S I LIKE HIM A LITTLE BUT WE ARE GROWN STRANGE TO
EACH OTHER
THEN RUB IT OFF POLLY RUB THE RUST AND THE STRANGENESS OFF
TALK
AWAY WHEN HE IS HERE AND HAVE NO FEAR OF HIM
HE DOES NOT TALK MUCH
IS HE AFRAID OF ME DO YOU THINK PAPA
OH TO BE SURE WHAT MAN WOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF SUCH A LITTLE SILENT
LADY
THEN TELL HIM SOME DAY NOT TO MIND MY BEING SILENT
SAY THAT IT IS MY
WAY AND THAT I HAVE NO UNFRIENDLY INTENTION
YOUR WAY YOU LITTLE CHATTER BOX SO FAR FROM BEING YOUR WAY IT IS
ONLY YOUR WHIM
WELL I'LL IMPROVE PAPA
AND VERY PRETTY WAS THE GRACE WITH WHICH THE NEXT DAY SHE TRIED TO
KEEP HER WORD
I SAW HER MAKE THE EFFORT TO CONVERSE AFFABLY WITH DR
JOHN ON GENERAL TOPICS
THE ATTENTION CALLED INTO HER GUEST'S FACE A
PLEASURABLE GLOW HE MET HER WITH CAUTION AND REPLIED TO HER IN HIS
SOFTEST TONES AS IF THERE WAS A KIND OF GOSSAMER HAPPINESS HANGING IN
THE AIR WHICH HE FEARED TO DISTURB BY DRAWING TOO DEEP A BREATH
CERTAINLY IN HER TIMID YET EARNEST ADVANCE TO FRIENDSHIP IT COULD NOT
BE DENIED THAT THERE WAS A MOST EXQUISITE AND FAIRY CHARM
WHEN THE DOCTOR WAS GONE SHE APPROACHED HER FATHER'S CHAIR
DID I KEEP MY WORD PAPA DID I BEHAVE BETTER
MY POLLY BEHAVED LIKE A QUEEN
I SHALL BECOME QUITE PROUD OF HER IF
THIS IMPROVEMENT CONTINUES
BY AND BY WE SHALL SEE HER RECEIVING MY
GUESTS WITH QUITE A CALM GRAND MANNER
MISS LUCY AND I WILL HAVE TO
LOOK ABOUT US AND POLISH UP ALL OUR BEST AIRS AND GRACES LEST WE
SHOULD BE THROWN INTO THE SHADE
STILL POLLY THERE IS A LITTLE
FLUTTER A LITTLE TENDENCY TO STAMMER NOW AND THEN AND EVEN TO LISP
AS YOU LISPED WHEN YOU WERE SIX YEARS OLD
NO PAPA INTERRUPTED SHE INDIGNANTLY THAT CAN'T BE TRUE
I APPEAL TO MISS LUCY
DID SHE NOT IN ANSWERING DR
BRETTON'S
QUESTION AS TO WHETHER SHE HAD EVER SEEN THE PALACE OF THE PRINCE OF
BOIS L'ETANG SAY 'YETH SHE HAD BEEN THERE 'THEVERAL' TIMES
PAPA YOU ARE SATIRICAL YOU ARE MCHANT I CAN PRONOUNCE ALL THE
LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET AS CLEARLY AS YOU CAN
BUT TELL ME THIS YOU ARE
VERY PARTICULAR IN MAKING ME BE CIVIL TO DR
BRETTON DO YOU LIKE HIM
YOURSELF
TO BE SURE FOR OLD ACQUAINTANCE SAKE I LIKE HIM THEN HE IS A VERY
GOOD SON TO HIS MOTHER BESIDES BEING A KIND HEARTED FELLOW AND CLEVER
IN HIS PROFESSION YES THE CALLANT IS WELL ENOUGH
CALLANT AH SCOTCHMAN PAPA IS IT THE EDINBURGH OR THE ABERDEEN
ACCENT YOU HAVE
BOTH MY PET BOTH AND DOUBTLESS THE GLASWEGIAN INTO THE BARGAIN
IT
IS THAT WHICH ENABLES ME TO SPEAK FRENCH SO WELL A GUDE SCOTS TONGUE
ALWAYS SUCCEEDS WELL AT THE FRENCH
THE FRENCH SCOTCH AGAIN INCORRIGIBLE PAPA
YOU TOO NEED
SCHOOLING
WELL POLLY YOU MUST PERSUADE MISS SNOWE TO UNDERTAKE BOTH YOU AND
ME TO MAKE YOU STEADY AND WOMANLY AND ME REFINED AND CLASSICAL
THE LIGHT IN WHICH M
DE BASSOMPIERRE EVIDENTLY REGARDED MISS SNOWE
USED TO OCCASION ME MUCH INWARD EDIFICATION
WHAT CONTRADICTORY
ATTRIBUTES OF CHARACTER WE SOMETIMES FIND ASCRIBED TO US ACCORDING TO
THE EYE WITH WHICH WE ARE VIEWED MADAME BECK ESTEEMED ME LEARNED AND
BLUE MISS FANSHAWE CAUSTIC IRONIC AND CYNICAL MR
HOME A MODEL
TEACHER THE ESSENCE OF THE SEDATE AND DISCREET SOMEWHAT CONVENTIONAL
PERHAPS TOO STRICT LIMITED AND SCRUPULOUS BUT STILL THE PINK AND
PATTERN OF GOVERNESS CORRECTNESS WHILST ANOTHER PERSON PROFESSOR PAUL
EMANUEL TO WIT NEVER LOST AN OPPORTUNITY OF INTIMATING HIS OPINION
THAT MINE WAS RATHER A FIERY AND RASH NATURE ADVENTUROUS INDOCILE
AND AUDACIOUS
I SMILED AT THEM ALL
IF ANY ONE KNEW ME IT WAS LITTLE
PAULINA MARY
AS I WOULD NOT BE PAULINA'S NOMINAL AND PAID COMPANION GENIAL AND
HARMONIOUS AS I BEGAN TO FIND HER INTERCOURSE SHE PERSUADED ME TO JOIN
HER IN SOME STUDY AS A REGULAR AND SETTLED MEANS OF SUSTAINING
COMMUNICATION SHE PROPOSED THE GERMAN LANGUAGE WHICH LIKE MYSELF
SHE FOUND DIFFICULT OF MASTERY
WE AGREED TO TAKE OUR LESSONS IN THE
RUE CRCY OF THE SAME MISTRESS THIS ARRANGEMENT THREW US TOGETHER FOR
SOME HOURS OF EVERY WEEK
M
DE BASSOMPIERRE SEEMED QUITE PLEASED IT
PERFECTLY MET HIS APPROBATION THAT MADAME MINERVA GRAVITY SHOULD
ASSOCIATE A PORTION OF HER LEISURE WITH THAT OF HIS FAIR AND DEAR CHILD
THAT OTHER SELF ELECTED JUDGE OF MINE THE PROFESSOR IN THE RUE
FOSSETTE DISCOVERING BY SOME SURREPTITIOUS SPYING MEANS THAT I WAS NO
LONGER SO STATIONARY AS HITHERTO BUT WENT OUT REGULARLY AT CERTAIN
HOURS OF CERTAIN DAYS TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO PLACE ME UNDER
SURVEILLANCE
PEOPLE SAID M
EMANUEL HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP AMONGST
JESUITS
I SHOULD MORE READILY HAVE ACCREDITED THIS REPORT HAD HIS
MANOEUVRES BEEN BETTER MASKED
AS IT WAS I DOUBTED IT
NEVER WAS A
MORE UNDISGUISED SCHEMER A FRANKER LOOSER INTRIGUER
HE WOULD ANALYZE
HIS OWN MACHINATIONS ELABORATELY CONTRIVE PLOTS AND FORTHWITH INDULGE
IN EXPLANATORY BOASTS OF THEIR SKILL
I KNOW NOT WHETHER I WAS MORE
AMUSED OR PROVOKED BY HIS STEPPING UP TO ME ONE MORNING AND WHISPERING
SOLEMNLY THAT HE HAD HIS EYE ON ME HE AT LEAST WOULD DISCHARGE THE
DUTY OF A FRIEND AND NOT LEAVE ME ENTIRELY TO MY OWN DEVICES
MY
PROCEEDINGS SEEMED AT PRESENT VERY UNSETTLED HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO
MAKE OF THEM HE THOUGHT HIS COUSIN BECK VERY MUCH TO BLAME IN
SUFFERING THIS SORT OF FLUTTERING INCONSISTENCY IN A TEACHER ATTACHED
TO HER HOUSE
WHAT HAD A PERSON DEVOTED TO A SERIOUS CALLING THAT OF
EDUCATION TO DO WITH COUNTS AND COUNTESSES HOTELS AND CHTEAUX TO
HIM I SEEMED ALTOGETHER 'EN L'AIR ON HIS FAITH HE BELIEVED I WENT
OUT SIX DAYS IN THE SEVEN
I SAID MONSIEUR EXAGGERATED
I CERTAINLY HAD ENJOYED THE ADVANTAGE OF
A LITTLE CHANGE LATELY BUT NOT BEFORE IT HAD BECOME NECESSARY AND THE
PRIVILEGE WAS BY NO MEANS EXERCISED IN EXCESS
NECESSARY HOW WAS IT NECESSARY I WAS WELL ENOUGH HE SUPPOSED
CHANGE NECESSARY HE WOULD RECOMMEND ME TO LOOK AT THE CATHOLIC
'RELIGIEUSES AND STUDY THEIR LIVES
THEY ASKED NO CHANGE
I AM NO JUDGE OF WHAT EXPRESSION CROSSED MY FACE WHEN HE THUS SPOKE
BUT IT WAS ONE WHICH PROVOKED HIM HE ACCUSED ME OF BEING RECKLESS
WORLDLY AND EPICUREAN AMBITIOUS OF GREATNESS AND FEVERISHLY ATHIRST
FOR THE POMPS AND VANITIES OF LIFE
IT SEEMS I HAD NO DVOUEMENT NO
RCUEILLEMENT IN MY CHARACTER NO SPIRIT OF GRACE FAITH SACRIFICE
OR SELF ABASEMENT
FEELING THE INUTILITY OF ANSWERING THESE CHARGES I
MUTELY CONTINUED THE CORRECTION OF A PILE OF ENGLISH EXERCISES
HE COULD SEE IN ME NOTHING CHRISTIAN LIKE MANY OTHER PROTESTANTS I
REVELLED IN THE PRIDE AND SELF WILL OF PAGANISM
I SLIGHTLY TURNED FROM HIM NESTLING STILL CLOSER UNDER THE WING OF
SILENCE
A VAGUE SOUND GRUMBLED BETWEEN HIS TEETH IT COULD NOT SURELY BE A
JURON HE WAS TOO RELIGIOUS FOR THAT BUT I AM CERTAIN I HEARD THE
WORD SACR
GRIEVOUS TO RELATE THE SAME WORD WAS REPEATED WITH THE
UNEQUIVOCAL ADDITION OF MILLE SOMETHING WHEN I PASSED HIM ABOUT TWO
HOURS AFTERWARDS IN THE CORRIDOR PREPARED TO GO AND TAKE MY GERMAN
LESSON IN THE RUE CRCY
NEVER WAS A BETTER LITTLE MAN IN SOME POINTS
THAN M
PAUL NEVER IN OTHERS A MORE WASPISH LITTLE DESPOT
OUR GERMAN MISTRESS FRULEIN ANNA BRAUN WAS A WORTHY HEARTY WOMAN
OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE SHE OUGHT PERHAPS TO HAVE LIVED IN THE DAYS OF
QUEEN ELIZABETH AS SHE HABITUALLY CONSUMED FOR HER FIRST AND SECOND
BREAKFASTS BEER AND BEEF ALSO HER DIRECT AND DOWNRIGHT DEUTSCH
NATURE SEEMED TO SUFFER A SENSATION OF CRUEL RESTRAINT FROM WHAT SHE
CALLED OUR ENGLISH RESERVE THOUGH WE THOUGHT WE WERE VERY CORDIAL WITH
HER BUT WE DID NOT SLAP HER ON THE SHOULDER AND IF WE CONSENTED TO
KISS HER CHEEK IT WAS DONE QUIETLY AND WITHOUT ANY EXPLOSIVE SMACK
THESE OMISSIONS OPPRESSED AND DEPRESSED HER CONSIDERABLY STILL ON THE
WHOLE WE GOT ON VERY WELL
ACCUSTOMED TO INSTRUCT FOREIGN GIRLS WHO
HARDLY EVER WILL THINK AND STUDY FOR THEMSELVES WHO HAVE NO IDEA OF
GRAPPLING WITH A DIFFICULTY AND OVERCOMING IT BY DINT OF REFLECTION OR
APPLICATION OUR PROGRESS WHICH IN TRUTH WAS VERY LEISURELY SEEMED TO
ASTOUND HER
IN HER EYES WE WERE A PAIR OF GLACIAL PRODIGIES COLD
PROUD AND PRETERNATURAL
THE YOUNG COUNTESS WAS A LITTLE PROUD A LITTLE FASTIDIOUS AND
PERHAPS WITH HER NATIVE DELICACY AND BEAUTY SHE HAD A RIGHT TO THESE
FEELINGS BUT I THINK IT WAS A TOTAL MISTAKE TO ASCRIBE THEM TO ME
I
NEVER EVADED THE MORNING SALUTE WHICH PAULINA WOULD SLIP WHEN SHE
COULD NOR WAS A CERTAIN LITTLE MANNER OF STILL DISDAIN A WEAPON KNOWN
IN MY ARMOURY OF DEFENCE WHEREAS PAULINA ALWAYS KEPT IT CLEAR FINE
AND BRIGHT AND ANY ROUGH GERMAN SALLY CALLED FORTH AT ONCE ITS STEELLY
GLISTEN
HONEST ANNA BRAUN IN SOME MEASURE FELT THIS DIFFERENCE AND WHILE SHE
HALF FEARED HALF WORSHIPPED PAULINA AS A SORT OF DAINTY NYMPH AN
UNDINE SHE TOOK REFUGE WITH ME AS A BEING ALL MORTAL AND OF EASIER
MOOD
A BOOK WE LIKED WELL TO READ AND TRANSLATE WAS SCHILLER'S BALLADS
PAULINA SOON LEARNED TO READ THEM BEAUTIFULLY THE FRULEIN WOULD
LISTEN TO HER WITH A BROAD SMILE OF PLEASURE AND SAY HER VOICE SOUNDED
LIKE MUSIC
SHE TRANSLATED THEM TOO WITH A FACILE FLOW OF LANGUAGE
AND IN A STRAIN OF KINDRED AND POETIC FERVOUR HER CHEEK WOULD FLUSH
HER LIPS TREMBLINGLY SMILE HER BEAUTEOUS EYES KINDLE OR MELT AS SHE
WENT ON
SHE LEARNT THE BEST BY HEART AND WOULD OFTEN RECITE THEM WHEN
WE WERE ALONE TOGETHER
ONE SHE LIKED WELL WAS DES MDCHENS KLAGE
THAT IS SHE LIKED WELL TO REPEAT THE WORDS SHE FOUND PLAINTIVE MELODY
IN THE SOUND THE SENSE SHE WOULD CRITICISE
SHE MURMURED AS WE SAT
OVER THE FIRE ONE EVENING
DU HEILIGE RUFE DEIN KIND ZURCK
ICH HABE GENOSSEN DAS IRDISCHE GLCK
ICH HABE GELEBT UND GELIEBET
LIVED AND LOVED SAID SHE IS THAT THE SUMMIT OF EARTHLY HAPPINESS
THE END OF LIFE TO LOVE I DON'T THINK IT IS
IT MAY BE THE EXTREME OF
MORTAL MISERY IT MAY BE SHEER WASTE OF TIME AND FRUITLESS TORTURE OF
FEELING
IF SCHILLER HAD SAID TO BE LOVED HE MIGHT HAVE COME NEARER
THE TRUTH
IS NOT THAT ANOTHER THING LUCY TO BE LOVED
I SUPPOSE IT MAY BE BUT WHY CONSIDER THE SUBJECT WHAT IS LOVE TO
YOU WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT
SHE CRIMSONED HALF IN IRRITATION HALF IN SHAME
NOW LUCY SHE SAID I WON'T TAKE THAT FROM YOU
IT MAY BE WELL FOR
PAPA TO LOOK ON ME AS A BABY I RATHER PREFER THAT HE SHOULD THUS VIEW
ME BUT YOU KNOW AND SHALL LEARN TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM VERGING ON
MY NINETEENTH YEAR
NO MATTER IF IT WERE YOUR TWENTY NINTH WE WILL ANTICIPATE NO FEELINGS
BY DISCUSSION AND CONVERSATION WE WILL NOT TALK ABOUT LOVE
INDEED INDEED SAID SHE ALL IN HURRY AND HEAT YOU MAY THINK TO
CHECK AND HOLD ME IN AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE BUT I HAVE TALKED ABOUT
IT AND HEARD ABOUT IT TOO AND A GREAT DEAL AND LATELY AND
DISAGREEABLY AND DETRIMENTALLY AND IN A WAY YOU WOULDN'T APPROVE
AND THE VEXED TRIUMPHANT PRETTY NAUGHTY BEING LAUGHED
I COULD NOT
DISCERN WHAT SHE MEANT AND I WOULD NOT ASK HER I WAS NONPLUSSED
SEEING HOWEVER THE UTMOST INNOCENCE IN HER COUNTENANCE COMBINED WITH
SOME TRANSIENT PERVERSENESS AND PETULANCE I SAID AT LAST
WHO TALKS TO YOU DISAGREEABLY AND DETRIMENTALLY ON SUCH MATTERS WHO
THAT HAS NEAR ACCESS TO YOU WOULD DARE TO DO IT
LUCY REPLIED SHE MORE SOFTLY IT IS A PERSON WHO MAKES ME MISERABLE
SOMETIMES AND I WISH SHE WOULD KEEP AWAY I DON'T WANT HER
BUT WHO PAULINA CAN IT BE YOU PUZZLE ME MUCH
IT IS IT IS MY COUSIN GINEVRA
EVERY TIME SHE HAS LEAVE TO VISIT MRS
CHOLMONDELEY SHE CALLS HERE AND WHENEVER SHE FINDS ME ALONE SHE BEGINS
TO TALK ABOUT HER ADMIRERS
LOVE INDEED YOU SHOULD HEAR ALL SHE HAS
TO SAY ABOUT LOVE
OH I HAVE HEARD IT SAID I QUITE COOLLY AND ON THE WHOLE PERHAPS
IT IS AS WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD IT TOO IT IS NOT TO BE REGRETTED
IT IS ALL RIGHT
YET SURELY GINEVRA'S MIND CANNOT INFLUENCE YOURS
YOU CAN LOOK OVER BOTH HER HEAD AND HER HEART
SHE DOES INFLUENCE ME VERY MUCH
SHE HAS THE ART OF DISTURBING MY
HAPPINESS AND UNSETTLING MY OPINIONS
SHE HURTS ME THROUGH THE FEELINGS
AND PEOPLE DEAREST TO ME
WHAT DOES SHE SAY PAULINA GIVE ME SOME IDEA
THERE MAY BE
COUNTERACTION OF THE DAMAGE DONE
THE PEOPLE I HAVE LONGEST AND MOST ESTEEMED ARE DEGRADED BY HER
SHE
DOES NOT SPARE MRS
BRETTON SHE DOES NOT SPARE
GRAHAM
NO I DARESAY AND HOW DOES SHE MIX UP THESE WITH HER SENTIMENT AND
HER LOVE SHE DOES MIX THEM I SUPPOSE
LUCY SHE IS INSOLENT AND I BELIEVE FALSE
YOU KNOW DR
BRETTON
WE
BOTH KNOW HIM
HE MAY BE CARELESS AND PROUD BUT WHEN WAS HE EVER MEAN
OR SLAVISH DAY AFTER DAY SHE SHOWS HIM TO ME KNEELING AT HER FEET
PURSUING HER LIKE HER SHADOW
SHE REPULSING HIM WITH INSULT AND HE
IMPLORING HER WITH INFATUATION
LUCY IS IT TRUE IS ANY OF IT TRUE
IT MAY BE TRUE THAT HE ONCE THOUGHT HER HANDSOME DOES SHE GIVE HIM
OUT AS STILL HER SUITOR
SHE SAYS SHE MIGHT MARRY HIM ANY DAY HE ONLY WAITS HER CONSENT
IT IS THESE TALES WHICH HAVE CAUSED THAT RESERVE IN YOUR MANNER
TOWARDS GRAHAM WHICH YOUR FATHER NOTICED
THEY HAVE CERTAINLY MADE ME ALL DOUBTFUL ABOUT HIS CHARACTER
AS
GINEVRA SPEAKS THEY DO NOT CARRY WITH THEM THE SOUND OF UNMIXED TRUTH
I BELIEVE SHE EXAGGERATES PERHAPS INVENTS BUT I WANT TO KNOW HOW FAR
SUPPOSE WE BRING MISS FANSHAWE TO SOME PROOF
GIVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY
OF DISPLAYING THE POWER SHE BOASTS
I COULD DO THAT TO MORROW
PAPA HAS ASKED SOME GENTLEMEN TO DINNER
ALL SAVANTS
GRAHAM WHO PAPA IS BEGINNING TO DISCOVER IS A SAVANT
TOO SKILLED THEY SAY IN MORE THAN ONE BRANCH OF SCIENCE IS AMONG
THE NUMBER
NOW I SHOULD BE MISERABLE TO SIT AT TABLE UNSUPPORTED
AMIDST SUCH A PARTY
I COULD NOT TALK TO MESSIEURS A AND Z THE
PARISIAN ACADEMICIANS ALL MY NEW CREDIT FOR MANNER WOULD BE PUT IN
PERIL
YOU AND MRS
BRETTON MUST COME FOR MY SAKE GINEVRA AT A WORD
WILL JOIN YOU
YES THEN I WILL CARRY A MESSAGE OF INVITATION AND SHE SHALL HAVE THE
CHANCE OF JUSTIFYING HER CHARACTER FOR VERACITY
CHAPTER XXVII
THE HTEL CRCY
THE MORROW TURNED OUT A MORE LIVELY AND BUSY DAY THAN WE OR THAN I AT
LEAST HAD ANTICIPATED
IT SEEMS IT WAS THE BIRTHDAY OF ONE OF THE YOUNG
PRINCES OF LABASSECOUR THE ELDEST I THINK THE DUC DE DINDONNEAU AND
A GENERAL HOLIDAY WAS GIVEN IN HIS HONOUR AT THE SCHOOLS AND
ESPECIALLY AT THE PRINCIPAL ATHNE OR COLLEGE
THE YOUTH OF THAT
INSTITUTION HAD ALSO CONCOCTED AND WERE TO PRESENT A LOYAL ADDRESS
FOR WHICH PURPOSE THEY WERE TO BE ASSEMBLED IN THE PUBLIC BUILDING
WHERE THE YEARLY EXAMINATIONS WERE CONDUCTED AND THE PRIZES
DISTRIBUTED
AFTER THE CEREMONY OF PRESENTATION AN ORATION OR
DISCOURS WAS TO FOLLOW FROM ONE OF THE PROFESSORS
SEVERAL OF M
DE BASSOMPIERRE'S FRIENDS THE SAVANTS BEING MORE OR LESS
CONNECTED WITH THE ATHNE THEY WERE EXPECTED TO ATTEND ON THIS
OCCASION TOGETHER WITH THE WORSHIPFUL MUNICIPALITY OF VILLETTE M
LE
CHEVALIER STAAS THE BURGOMASTER AND THE PARENTS AND KINSFOLK OF THE
ATHENIANS IN GENERAL
M
DE BASSOMPIERRE WAS ENGAGED BY HIS FRIENDS TO
ACCOMPANY THEM HIS FAIR DAUGHTER WOULD OF COURSE BE OF THE PARTY
AND SHE WROTE A LITTLE NOTE TO GINEVRA AND MYSELF BIDDING US COME
EARLY THAT WE MIGHT JOIN HER
AS MISS FANSHAWE AND I WERE DRESSING IN THE DORMITORY OF THE RUE
FOSSETTE SHE MISS F SUDDENLY BURST INTO A LAUGH
WHAT NOW I ASKED FOR SHE HAD SUSPENDED THE OPERATION OF ARRANGING
HER ATTIRE AND WAS GAZING AT ME
IT SEEMS SO ODD SHE REPLIED WITH HER USUAL HALF HONEST
HALF INSOLENT UNRESERVE THAT YOU AND I SHOULD NOW BE SO MUCH ON A
LEVEL VISITING IN THE SAME SPHERE HAVING THE SAME CONNECTIONS
WHY YES SAID I I HAD NOT MUCH RESPECT FOR THE CONNECTIONS YOU
CHIEFLY FREQUENTED AWHILE AGO MRS
CHOLMONDELEY AND CO
WOULD NEVER
HAVE SUITED ME AT ALL
WHO ARE YOU MISS SNOWE SHE INQUIRED IN A TONE OF SUCH
UNDISGUISED AND UNSOPHISTICATED CURIOSITY AS MADE ME LAUGH IN MY TURN
YOU USED TO CALL YOURSELF A NURSERY GOVERNESS WHEN YOU FIRST CAME
HERE YOU REALLY HAD THE CARE OF THE CHILDREN IN THIS HOUSE I HAVE SEEN
YOU CARRY LITTLE GEORGETTE IN YOUR ARMS LIKE A BONNE FEW GOVERNESSES
WOULD HAVE CONDESCENDED SO FAR AND NOW MADAME BECK TREATS YOU WITH
MORE COURTESY THAN SHE TREATS THE PARISIENNE ST
PIERRE AND THAT
PROUD CHIT MY COUSIN MAKES YOU HER BOSOM FRIEND
WONDERFUL I AGREED MUCH AMUSED AT HER MYSTIFICATION
WHO AM I
INDEED PERHAPS A PERSONAGE IN DISGUISE
PITY I DON'T LOOK THE
CHARACTER
I WONDER YOU ARE NOT MORE FLATTERED BY ALL THIS SHE WENT ON YOU
TAKE IT WITH STRANGE COMPOSURE
IF YOU REALLY ARE THE NOBODY I ONCE
THOUGHT YOU YOU MUST BE A COOL HAND
THE NOBODY YOU ONCE THOUGHT ME I REPEATED AND MY FACE GREW A LITTLE
HOT BUT I WOULD NOT BE ANGRY OF WHAT IMPORTANCE WAS A SCHOOL GIRL'S
CRUDE USE OF THE TERMS NOBODY AND SOMEBODY I CONFINED MYSELF
THEREFORE TO THE REMARK THAT I HAD MERELY MET WITH CIVILITY AND ASKED
WHAT SHE SAW IN CIVILITY TO THROW THE RECIPIENT INTO A FEVER OF
CONFUSION
ONE CAN'T HELP WONDERING AT SOME THINGS SHE PERSISTED
WONDERING AT MARVELS OF YOUR OWN MANUFACTURE
ARE YOU READY AT LAST
YES LET ME TAKE YOUR ARM
I WOULD RATHER NOT WE WILL WALK SIDE BY SIDE
WHEN SHE TOOK MY ARM SHE ALWAYS LEANED UPON ME HER WHOLE WEIGHT AND
AS I WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN OR HER LOVER I DID NOT LIKE IT
THERE AGAIN SHE CRIED
I THOUGHT BY OFFERING TO TAKE YOUR ARM TO
INTIMATE APPROBATION OF YOUR DRESS AND GENERAL APPEARANCE I MEANT IT
AS A COMPLIMENT
YOU DID YOU MEANT IN SHORT TO EXPRESS THAT YOU ARE NOT ASHAMED TO
BE SEEN IN THE STREET WITH ME THAT IF MRS
CHOLMONDELEY SHOULD BE
FONDLING HER LAPDOG AT SOME WINDOW OR COLONEL DE HAMAL PICKING HIS
TEETH IN A BALCONY AND SHOULD CATCH A GLIMPSE OF US YOU WOULD NOT
QUITE BLUSH FOR YOUR COMPANION
YES SAID SHE WITH THAT DIRECTNESS WHICH WAS HER BEST POINT WHICH
GAVE AN HONEST PLAINNESS TO HER VERY FIBS WHEN SHE TOLD THEM WHICH
WAS IN SHORT THE SALT THE SOLE PRESERVATIVE INGREDIENT OF A
CHARACTER OTHERWISE NOT FORMED TO KEEP
I DELEGATED THE TROUBLE OF COMMENTING ON THIS YES TO MY COUNTENANCE
OR RATHER MY UNDER LIP VOLUNTARILY ANTICIPATED MY TONGUE OF COURSE
REVERENCE AND SOLEMNITY WERE NOT THE FEELINGS EXPRESSED IN THE LOOK I
GAVE HER
SCORNFUL SNEERING CREATURE SHE WENT ON AS WE CROSSED A GREAT
SQUARE AND ENTERED THE QUIET PLEASANT PARK OUR NEAREST WAY TO THE
RUE CRCY
NOBODY IN THIS WORLD WAS EVER SUCH A TURK TO ME AS YOU ARE
YOU BRING IT ON YOURSELF LET ME ALONE HAVE THE SENSE TO BE QUIET I
WILL LET YOU ALONE
AS IF ONE COULD LET YOU ALONE WHEN YOU ARE SO PECULIAR AND SO
MYSTERIOUS
THE MYSTERY AND PECULIARITY BEING ENTIRELY THE CONCEPTION OF YOUR OWN
BRAIN MAGGOTS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS BE SO GOOD AS TO KEEP THEM OUT
OF MY SIGHT
BUT ARE YOU ANYBODY PERSEVERED SHE PUSHING HER HAND IN SPITE OF
ME UNDER MY ARM AND THAT ARM PRESSED ITSELF WITH INHOSPITABLE
CLOSENESS AGAINST MY SIDE BY WAY OF KEEPING OUT THE INTRUDER
YES I SAID I AM A RISING CHARACTER ONCE AN OLD LADY'S COMPANION
THEN A NURSERY GOVERNESS NOW A SCHOOL TEACHER
DO DO TELL ME WHO YOU ARE I'LL NOT REPEAT IT SHE URGED ADHERING
WITH LUDICROUS TENACITY TO THE WISE NOTION OF AN INCOGNITO SHE HAD GOT
HOLD OF AND SHE SQUEEZED THE ARM OF WHICH SHE HAD NOW OBTAINED FULL
POSSESSION AND COAXED AND CONJURED TILL I WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE IN THE
PARK TO LAUGH
THROUGHOUT OUR WALK SHE RANG THE MOST FANCIFUL CHANGES
ON THIS THEME PROVING BY HER OBSTINATE CREDULITY OR INCREDULITY HER
INCAPACITY TO CONCEIVE HOW ANY PERSON NOT BOLSTERED UP BY BIRTH OR
WEALTH NOT SUPPORTED BY SOME CONSCIOUSNESS OF NAME OR CONNECTION
COULD MAINTAIN AN ATTITUDE OF REASONABLE INTEGRITY
AS FOR ME IT QUITE
SUFFICED TO MY MENTAL TRANQUILLITY THAT I WAS KNOWN WHERE IT IMPORTED
THAT KNOWN I SHOULD BE THE REST SAT ON ME EASILY PEDIGREE SOCIAL
POSITION AND RECONDITE INTELLECTUAL ACQUISITION OCCUPIED ABOUT THE
SAME SPACE AND PLACE IN MY INTERESTS AND THOUGHTS THEY WERE MY
THIRD CLASS LODGERS TO WHOM COULD BE ASSIGNED ONLY THE SMALL
SITTING ROOM AND THE LITTLE BACK BEDROOM EVEN IF THE DINING AND
DRAWING ROOMS STOOD EMPTY I NEVER CONFESSED IT TO THEM AS THINKING
MINOR ACCOMMODATIONS BETTER SUITED TO THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES
THE WORLD I
SOON LEARNED HELD A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE AND I MAKE NO DOUBT THE WORLD
IS VERY RIGHT IN ITS VIEW YET BELIEVE ALSO THAT I AM NOT QUITE WRONG
IN MINE
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHOM A LOWERED POSITION DEGRADES MORALLY TO WHOM LOSS
OF CONNECTION COSTS LOSS OF SELF RESPECT ARE NOT THESE JUSTIFIED IN
PLACING THE HIGHEST VALUE ON THAT STATION AND ASSOCIATION WHICH IS
THEIR SAFEGUARD FROM DEBASEMENT IF A MAN FEELS THAT HE WOULD BECOME
CONTEMPTIBLE IN HIS OWN EYES WERE IT GENERALLY KNOWN THAT HIS ANCESTRY
WERE SIMPLE AND NOT GENTLE POOR AND NOT RICH WORKERS AND NOT
CAPITALISTS WOULD IT BE RIGHT SEVERELY TO BLAME HIM FOR KEEPING THESE
FATAL FACTS OUT OF SIGHT FOR STARTING TREMBLING QUAILING AT THE
CHANCE WHICH THREATENS EXPOSURE THE LONGER WE LIVE THE MORE OUT
EXPERIENCE WIDENS THE LESS PRONE ARE WE TO JUDGE OUR NEIGHBOUR'S
CONDUCT TO QUESTION THE WORLD'S WISDOM WHEREVER AN ACCUMULATION OF
SMALL DEFENCES IS FOUND WHETHER SURROUNDING THE PRUDE'S VIRTUE OR THE
MAN OF THE WORLD'S RESPECTABILITY THERE BE SURE IT IS NEEDED
WE REACHED THE HTEL CRCY PAULINA WAS READY MRS
BRETTON WAS WITH
HER AND UNDER HER ESCORT AND THAT OF M
DE BASSOMPIERRE WE WERE SOON
CONDUCTED TO THE PLACE OF ASSEMBLY AND SEATED IN GOOD SEATS AT A
CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM THE TRIBUNE
THE YOUTH OF THE ATHNE WERE
MARSHALLED BEFORE US THE MUNICIPALITY AND THEIR BOURGMESTRE WERE IN
PLACES OF HONOUR THE YOUNG PRINCES WITH THEIR TUTORS OCCUPIED A
CONSPICUOUS POSITION AND THE BODY OF THE BUILDING WAS CROWDED WITH THE
ARISTOCRACY AND FIRST BURGHERS OF THE TOWN
CONCERNING THE IDENTITY OF THE PROFESSOR BY WHOM THE DISCOURS WAS TO
BE DELIVERED I HAD AS YET ENTERTAINED NEITHER CARE NOR QUESTION
SOME
VAGUE EXPECTATION I HAD THAT A SAVANT WOULD STAND UP AND DELIVER A
FORMAL SPEECH HALF DOGMATISM TO THE ATHENIANS HALF FLATTERY TO THE
PRINCES
THE TRIBUNE WAS YET EMPTY WHEN WE ENTERED BUT IN TEN MINUTES AFTER IT
WAS FILLED SUDDENLY IN A SECOND OF TIME A HEAD CHEST AND ARMS GREW
ABOVE THE CRIMSON DESK
THIS HEAD I KNEW ITS COLOUR SHAPE PORT
EXPRESSION WERE FAMILIAR BOTH TO ME AND MISS FANSHAWE THE BLACKNESS
AND CLOSENESS OF CRANIUM THE AMPLITUDE AND PALENESS OF BROW THE
BLUENESS AND FIRE OF GLANCE WERE DETAILS SO DOMESTICATED IN THE
MEMORY AND SO KNIT WITH MANY A WHIMSICAL ASSOCIATION AS ALMOST BY
THIS THEIR SUDDEN APPARITION TO TICKLE FANCY TO A LAUGH
INDEED I
CONFESS FOR MY PART I DID LAUGH TILL I WAS WARM BUT THEN I BENT MY
HEAD AND MADE MY HANDKERCHIEF AND A LOWERED VEIL THE SOLE CONFIDANTS
OF MY MIRTH
I THINK I WAS GLAD TO SEE M
PAUL I THINK IT WAS RATHER PLEASANT THAN
OTHERWISE TO BEHOLD HIM SET UP THERE FIERCE AND FRANK DARK AND
CANDID TESTY AND FEARLESS AS WHEN REGNANT ON HIS ESTRADE IN CLASS
HIS PRESENCE WAS SUCH A SURPRISE I HAD NOT ONCE THOUGHT OF EXPECTING
HIM THOUGH I KNEW HE FILLED THE CHAIR OF BELLES LETTRES IN THE
COLLEGE
WITH HIM IN THAT TRIBUNE I FELT SURE THAT NEITHER FORMALISM
NOR FLATTERY WOULD BE OUR DOOM BUT FOR WHAT WAS VOUCHSAFED US FOR
WHAT WAS POURED SUDDENLY RAPIDLY CONTINUOUSLY ON OUR HEADS I OWN I
WAS NOT PREPARED
HE SPOKE TO THE PRINCES THE NOBLES THE MAGISTRATES AND THE BURGHERS
WITH JUST THE SAME EASE WITH ALMOST THE SAME POINTED CHOLERIC
EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH HE WAS WONT TO HARANGUE THE THREE DIVISIONS OF
THE RUE FOSSETTE
THE COLLEGIANS HE ADDRESSED NOT AS SCHOOLBOYS BUT
AS FUTURE CITIZENS AND EMBRYO PATRIOTS
THE TIMES WHICH HAVE SINCE COME
ON EUROPE HAD NOT BEEN FORETOLD YET AND M
EMANUEL'S SPIRIT SEEMED NEW
TO ME
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE FLAT AND FAT SOIL OF LABASSECOUR
COULD YIELD POLITICAL CONVICTIONS AND NATIONAL FEELINGS SUCH AS WERE
NOW STRONGLY EXPRESSED OF THE BEARING OF HIS OPINIONS I NEED HERE GIVE
NO SPECIAL INDICATION YET IT MAY BE PERMITTED ME TO SAY THAT I
BELIEVED THE LITTLE MAN NOT MORE EARNEST THAN RIGHT IN WHAT HE SAID
WITH ALL HIS FIRE HE WAS SEVERE AND SENSIBLE HE TRAMPLED UTOPIAN
THEORIES UNDER HIS HEEL HE REJECTED WILD DREAMS WITH SCORN BUT WHEN
HE LOOKED IN THE FACE OF TYRANNY OH THEN THERE OPENED A LIGHT IN HIS
EYE WORTH SEEING AND WHEN HE SPOKE OF INJUSTICE HIS VOICE GAVE NO
UNCERTAIN SOUND BUT REMINDED ME RATHER OF THE BAND TRUMPET RINGING AT
TWILIGHT FROM THE PARK
I DO NOT THINK HIS AUDIENCE WERE GENERALLY SUSCEPTIBLE OF SHARING HIS
FLAME IN ITS PURITY BUT SOME OF THE COLLEGE YOUTH CAUGHT FIRE AS HE
ELOQUENTLY TOLD THEM WHAT SHOULD BE THEIR PATH AND ENDEAVOUR IN THEIR
COUNTRY'S AND IN EUROPE'S FUTURE
THEY GAVE HIM A LONG LOUD RINGING
CHEER AS HE CONCLUDED WITH ALL HIS FIERCENESS HE WAS THEIR FAVOURITE
PROFESSOR
AS OUR PARTY LEFT THE HALL HE STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE HE SAW AND KNEW
ME AND LIFTED HIS HAT HE OFFERED HIS HAND IN PASSING AND UTTERED THE
WORDS QU'EN DITES VOUS QUESTION EMINENTLY CHARACTERISTIC AND
REMINDING ME EVEN IN THIS HIS MOMENT OF TRIUMPH OF THAT INQUISITIVE
RESTLESSNESS THAT ABSENCE OF WHAT I CONSIDERED DESIRABLE SELF CONTROL
WHICH WERE AMONGST HIS FAULTS
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE CARED JUST THEN TO
ASK WHAT I THOUGHT OR WHAT ANYBODY THOUGHT BUT HE DID CARE AND HE
WAS TOO NATURAL TO CONCEAL TOO IMPULSIVE TO REPRESS HIS WISH
WELL IF
I BLAMED HIS OVER EAGERNESS I LIKED HIS NAIVET
I WOULD HAVE
PRAISED HIM I HAD PLENTY OF PRAISE IN MY HEART BUT ALAS NO WORDS ON
MY LIPS
WHO HAS WORDS AT THE RIGHT MOMENT I STAMMERED SOME LAME
EXPRESSIONS BUT WAS TRULY GLAD WHEN OTHER PEOPLE COMING UP WITH
PROFUSE CONGRATULATIONS COVERED MY DEFICIENCY BY THEIR REDUNDANCY
A GENTLEMAN INTRODUCED HIM TO M
DE BASSOMPIERRE AND THE COUNT WHO
HAD LIKEWISE BEEN HIGHLY GRATIFIED ASKED HIM TO JOIN HIS FRIENDS FOR
THE MOST PART M
EMANUEL'S LIKEWISE AND TO DINE WITH THEM AT THE
HTEL CRCY
HE DECLINED DINNER FOR HE WAS A MAN ALWAYS SOMEWHAT SHY
AT MEETING THE ADVANCES OF THE WEALTHY THERE WAS A STRENGTH OF STURDY
INDEPENDENCE IN THE STRINGING OF HIS SINEWS NOT OBTRUSIVE BUT
PLEASANT ENOUGH TO DISCOVER AS ONE ADVANCED IN KNOWLEDGE OF HIS
CHARACTER HE PROMISED HOWEVER TO STEP IN WITH HIS FRIEND M
A
A FRENCH ACADEMICIAN IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING
AT DINNER THAT DAY GINEVRA AND PAULINA EACH LOOKED IN HER OWN WAY
VERY BEAUTIFUL THE FORMER PERHAPS BOASTED THE ADVANTAGE IN MATERIAL
CHARMS BUT THE LATTER SHONE PRE EMINENT FOR ATTRACTIONS MORE SUBTLE
AND SPIRITUAL FOR LIGHT AND ELOQUENCE OF EYE FOR GRACE OF MIEN FOR
WINNING VARIETY OF EXPRESSION
GINEVRA'S DRESS OF DEEP CRIMSON RELIEVED
WELL HER LIGHT CURLS AND HARMONIZED WITH HER ROSE LIKE BLOOM
PAULINA'S ATTIRE IN FASHION CLOSE THOUGH FAULTLESSLY NEAT BUT IN
TEXTURE CLEAR AND WHITE MADE THE EYE GRATEFUL FOR THE DELICATE LIFE OF
HER COMPLEXION FOR THE SOFT ANIMATION OF HER COUNTENANCE FOR THE
TENDER DEPTH OF HER EYES FOR THE BROWN SHADOW AND BOUNTEOUS FLOW OF
HER HAIR DARKER THAN THAT OF HER SAXON COUSIN AS WERE ALSO HER
EYEBROWS HER EYELASHES HER FULL IRIDS AND LARGE MOBILE PUPILS
NATURE HAVING TRACED ALL THESE DETAILS SLIGHTLY AND WITH A CARELESS
HAND IN MISS FANSHAWE'S CASE AND IN MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE'S WROUGHT
THEM TO A HIGH AND DELICATE FINISH
PAULINA WAS AWED BY THE SAVANTS BUT NOT QUITE TO MUTISM SHE CONVERSED
MODESTLY DIFFIDENTLY NOT WITHOUT EFFORT BUT WITH SO TRUE A
SWEETNESS SO FINE AND PENETRATING A SENSE THAT HER FATHER MORE THAN
ONCE SUSPENDED HIS OWN DISCOURSE TO LISTEN AND FIXED ON HER AN EYE OF
PROUD DELIGHT
IT WAS A POLITE FRENCHMAN M
Z A VERY LEARNED BUT
QUITE A COURTLY MAN WHO HAD DRAWN HER INTO DISCOURSE
I WAS CHARMED
WITH HER FRENCH IT WAS FAULTLESS THE STRUCTURE CORRECT THE IDIOMS
TRUE THE ACCENT PURE GINEVRA WHO HAD LIVED HALF HER LIFE ON THE
CONTINENT COULD DO NOTHING LIKE IT NOT THAT WORDS EVER FAILED MISS
FANSHAWE BUT REAL ACCURACY AND PURITY SHE NEITHER POSSESSED NOR IN
ANY NUMBER OF YEARS WOULD ACQUIRE
HERE TOO M
DE BASSOMPIERRE WAS
GRATIFIED FOR ON THE POINT OF LANGUAGE HE WAS CRITICAL
ANOTHER LISTENER AND OBSERVER THERE WAS ONE WHO DETAINED BY SOME
EXIGENCY OF HIS PROFESSION HAD COME IN LATE TO DINNER
BOTH LADIES
WERE QUIETLY SCANNED BY DR
BRETTON AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING HIS SEAT
AT THE TABLE AND THAT GUARDED SURVEY WAS MORE THAN ONCE RENEWED
HIS
ARRIVAL ROUSED MISS FANSHAWE WHO HAD HITHERTO APPEARED LISTLESS SHE
NOW BECAME SMILING AND COMPLACENT TALKED THOUGH WHAT SHE SAID WAS
RARELY TO THE PURPOSE OR RATHER WAS OF A PURPOSE SOMEWHAT
MORTIFYINGLY BELOW THE STANDARD OF THE OCCASION
HER LIGHT
DISCONNECTED PRATTLE MIGHT HAVE GRATIFIED GRAHAM ONCE PERHAPS IT
PLEASED HIM STILL PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY FANCY WHICH SUGGESTED THE
THOUGHT THAT WHILE HIS EYE WAS FILLED AND HIS EAR FED HIS TASTE HIS
KEEN ZEST HIS LIVELY INTELLIGENCE WERE NOT EQUALLY CONSULTED AND
REGALED
IT IS CERTAIN THAT RESTLESS AND EXACTING AS SEEMED THE DEMAND
ON HIS ATTENTION HE YIELDED COURTEOUSLY ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED HIS
MANNER SHOWED NEITHER PIQUE NOR COOLNESS GINEVRA WAS HIS NEIGHBOUR
AND TO HER DURING DINNER HE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY CONFINED HIS NOTICE
SHE APPEARED SATISFIED AND PASSED TO THE DRAWING ROOM IN VERY GOOD
SPIRITS
YET NO SOONER HAD WE REACHED THAT PLACE OF REFUGE THAN SHE AGAIN
BECAME FLAT AND LISTLESS THROWING HERSELF ON A COUCH SHE DENOUNCED
BOTH THE DISCOURS AND THE DINNER AS STUPID AFFAIRS AND INQUIRED OF
HER COUSIN HOW SHE COULD HEAR SUCH A SET OF PROSAIC GROS BONNETS AS
HER FATHER GATHERED ABOUT HIM
THE MOMENT THE GENTLEMEN WERE HEARD TO
MOVE HER RAILINGS CEASED SHE STARTED UP FLEW TO THE PIANO AND
DASHED AT IT WITH SPIRIT
DR
BRETTON ENTERING ONE OF THE FIRST TOOK
UP HIS STATION BESIDE HER
I THOUGHT HE WOULD NOT LONG MAINTAIN THAT
POST THERE WAS A POSITION NEAR THE HEARTH TO WHICH I EXPECTED TO SEE
HIM ATTRACTED THIS POSITION HE ONLY SCANNED WITH HIS EYE WHILE HE
LOOKED OTHERS DREW IN
THE GRACE AND MIND OF PAULINA CHARMED THESE
THOUGHTFUL FRENCHMEN THE FINENESS OF HER BEAUTY THE SOFT COURTESY OF
HER MANNER HER IMMATURE BUT REAL AND INBRED TACT PLEASED THEIR
NATIONAL TASTE THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT HER NOT INDEED TO TALK SCIENCE
WHICH WOULD HAVE RENDERED HER DUMB BUT TO TOUCH ON MANY SUBJECTS IN
LETTERS IN ARTS IN ACTUAL LIFE ON WHICH IT SOON APPEARED THAT SHE
HAD BOTH READ AND REFLECTED
I LISTENED
I AM SURE THAT THOUGH GRAHAM
STOOD ALOOF HE LISTENED TOO HIS HEARING AS WELL AS HIS VISION WAS
VERY FINE QUICK DISCRIMINATING
I KNEW HE GATHERED THE CONVERSATION
I FELT THAT THE MODE IN WHICH IT WAS SUSTAINED SUITED HIM
EXQUISITELY PLEASED HIM ALMOST TO PAIN
IN PAULINA THERE WAS MORE FORCE BOTH OF FEELING AND CHARACTER THAN
MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THAN GRAHAM HIMSELF IMAGINED THAN SHE WOULD EVER
SHOW TO THOSE WHO DID NOT WISH TO SEE IT
TO SPEAK TRUTH READER THERE
IS NO EXCELLENT BEAUTY NO ACCOMPLISHED GRACE NO RELIABLE REFINEMENT
WITHOUT STRENGTH AS EXCELLENT AS COMPLETE AS TRUSTWORTHY
AS WELL
MIGHT YOU LOOK FOR GOOD FRUIT AND BLOSSOM ON A ROOTLESS AND SAPLESS
TREE AS FOR CHARMS THAT WILL ENDURE IN A FEEBLE AND RELAXED NATURE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE THE BLOOMING SEMBLANCE OF BEAUTY MAY FLOURISH ROUND
WEAKNESS BUT IT CANNOT BEAR A BLAST IT SOON FADES EVEN IN SERENEST
SUNSHINE
GRAHAM WOULD HAVE STARTED HAD ANY SUGGESTIVE SPIRIT WHISPERED
OF THE SINEW AND THE STAMINA SUSTAINING THAT DELICATE NATURE BUT I WHO
HAD KNOWN HER AS A CHILD KNEW OR GUESSED BY WHAT A GOOD AND STRONG
ROOT HER GRACES HELD TO THE FIRM SOIL OF REALITY
WHILE DR
BRETTON LISTENED AND WAITED AN OPENING IN THE MAGIC CIRCLE
HIS GLANCE RESTLESSLY SWEEPING THE ROOM AT INTERVALS LIGHTED BY CHANCE
ON ME WHERE I SAT IN A QUIET NOOK NOT FAR FROM MY GODMOTHER AND M
DE
BASSOMPIERRE WHO AS USUAL WERE ENGAGED IN WHAT MR
HOME CALLED A
TWO HANDED CRACK WHAT THE COUNT WOULD HAVE INTERPRETED AS A
TTE TTE
GRAHAM SMILED RECOGNITION CROSSED THE ROOM ASKED ME HOW
I WAS TOLD ME I LOOKED PALE
I ALSO HAD MY OWN SMILE AT MY OWN
THOUGHT IT WAS NOW ABOUT THREE MONTHS SINCE DR
JOHN HAD SPOKEN TO
ME A LAPSE OF WHICH HE WAS NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS
HE SAT DOWN AND BECAME
SILENT
HIS WISH WAS RATHER TO LOOK THAN CONVERSE
GINEVRA AND PAULINA
WERE NOW OPPOSITE TO HIM HE COULD GAZE HIS FILL HE SURVEYED BOTH
FORMS STUDIED BOTH FACES
SEVERAL NEW GUESTS LADIES AS WELL AS GENTLEMEN HAD ENTERED THE ROOM
SINCE DINNER DROPPING IN FOR THE EVENING CONVERSATION AND AMONGST THE
GENTLEMEN I MAY INCIDENTALLY OBSERVE I HAD ALREADY NOTICED BY
GLIMPSES A SEVERE DARK PROFESSORIAL OUTLINE HOVERING ALOOF IN AN
INNER SALOON SEEN ONLY IN VISTA
M
EMANUEL KNEW MANY OF THE GENTLEMEN
PRESENT BUT I THINK WAS A STRANGER TO MOST OF THE LADIES EXCEPTING
MYSELF IN LOOKING TOWARDS THE HEARTH HE COULD NOT BUT SEE ME AND
NATURALLY MADE A MOVEMENT TO APPROACH SEEING HOWEVER DR
BRETTON
ALSO HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND HELD BACK
IF THAT HAD BEEN ALL THERE
WOULD HAVE BEEN NO CAUSE FOR QUARREL BUT NOT SATISFIED WITH HOLDING
BACK HE PUCKERED UP HIS EYEBROWS PROTRUDED HIS LIP AND LOOKED SO
UGLY THAT I AVERTED MY EYES FROM THE DISPLEASING SPECTACLE
M
JOSEPH
EMANUEL HAD ARRIVED AS WELL AS HIS AUSTERE BROTHER AND AT THIS VERY
MOMENT WAS RELIEVING GINEVRA AT THE PIANO
WHAT A MASTER TOUCH
SUCCEEDED HER SCHOOL GIRL JINGLE IN WHAT GRAND GRATEFUL TONES THE
INSTRUMENT ACKNOWLEDGED THE HAND OF THE TRUE ARTIST
LUCY BEGAN DR
BRETTON BREAKING SILENCE AND SMILING AS GINEVRA
GLIDED BEFORE HIM CASTING A GLANCE AS SHE PASSED BY MISS FANSHAWE IS
CERTAINLY A FINE GIRL
OF COURSE I ASSENTED
IS THERE HE PURSUED ANOTHER IN THE ROOM AS LOVELY
I THINK THERE IS NOT ANOTHER AS HANDSOME
I AGREE WITH YOU LUCY YOU AND I DO OFTEN AGREE IN OPINION IN TASTE
I THINK OR AT LEAST IN JUDGMENT
DO WE I SAID SOMEWHAT DOUBTFULLY
I BELIEVE IF YOU HAD BEEN A BOY LUCY INSTEAD OF A GIRL MY MOTHER'S
GOD SON INSTEAD OF HER GOD DAUGHTER WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS
OUR OPINIONS WOULD HAVE MELTED INTO EACH OTHER
HE HAD ASSUMED A BANTERING AIR A LIGHT HALF CARESSING HALF IRONIC
SHONE ASLANT IN HIS EYE
AH GRAHAM I HAVE GIVEN MORE THAN ONE
SOLITARY MOMENT TO THOUGHTS AND CALCULATIONS OF YOUR ESTIMATE OF LUCY
SNOWE WAS IT ALWAYS KIND OR JUST HAD LUCY BEEN INTRINSICALLY THE SAME
BUT POSSESSING THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OF WEALTH AND STATION WOULD
YOUR MANNER TO HER YOUR VALUE FOR HER HAVE BEEN QUITE WHAT THEY
ACTUALLY WERE AND YET BY THESE QUESTIONS I WOULD NOT SERIOUSLY INFER
BLAME
NO YOU MIGHT SADDEN AND TROUBLE ME SOMETIMES BUT THEN MINE WAS
A SOON DEPRESSED AN EASILY DERANGED TEMPERAMENT IT FELL IF A CLOUD
CROSSED THE SUN
PERHAPS BEFORE THE EYE OF SEVERE EQUITY I SHOULD STAND
MORE AT FAULT THAN YOU
TRYING THEN TO KEEP DOWN THE UNREASONABLE PAIN WHICH THRILLED MY
HEART ON THUS BEING MADE TO FEEL THAT WHILE GRAHAM COULD DEVOTE TO
OTHERS THE MOST GRAVE AND EARNEST THE MANLIEST INTEREST HE HAD NO
MORE THAN LIGHT RAILLERY FOR LUCY THE FRIEND OF LANG SYNE I INQUIRED
CALMLY ON WHAT POINTS ARE WE SO CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE
WE EACH HAVE AN OBSERVANT FACULTY
YOU PERHAPS DON'T GIVE ME CREDIT
FOR THE POSSESSION YET I HAVE IT
BUT YOU WERE SPEAKING OF TASTES WE MAY SEE THE SAME OBJECTS YET
ESTIMATE THEM DIFFERENTLY
LET US BRING IT TO THE TEST
OF COURSE YOU CANNOT BUT RENDER HOMAGE
TO THE MERITS OF MISS FANSHAWE NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OTHERS IN THE
ROOM MY MOTHER FOR INSTANCE OR THE LIONS YONDER MESSIEURS A
AND Z OR LET US SAY THAT PALE LITTLE LADY MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK OF YOUR MOTHER
I HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF MESSIEURS
A AND Z
AND THE OTHER
I THINK SHE IS AS YOU SAY A PALE LITTLE LADY PALE CERTAINLY JUST
NOW WHEN SHE IS FATIGUED WITH OVER EXCITEMENT
YOU DON'T REMEMBER HER AS A CHILD
I WONDER SOMETIMES WHETHER YOU DO
I HAD FORGOTTEN HER BUT IT IS NOTICEABLE THAT CIRCUMSTANCES
PERSONS EVEN WORDS AND LOOKS THAT HAD SLIPPED YOUR MEMORY MAY UNDER
CERTAIN CONDITIONS CERTAIN ASPECTS OF YOUR OWN OR ANOTHER'S MIND
REVIVE
THAT IS POSSIBLE ENOUGH
YET HE CONTINUED THE REVIVAL IS IMPERFECT NEEDS CONFIRMATION
PARTAKES SO MUCH OF THE DIM CHARACTER OF A DREAM OR OF THE AIRY ONE OF
A FANCY THAT THE TESTIMONY OF A WITNESS BECOMES NECESSARY FOR
CORROBORATION
WERE YOU NOT A GUEST AT BRETTON TEN YEARS AGO WHEN MR
HOME BROUGHT HIS LITTLE GIRL WHOM WE THEN CALLED 'LITTLE POLLY TO
STAY WITH MAMMA
I WAS THERE THE NIGHT SHE CAME AND ALSO THE MORNING SHE WENT AWAY
RATHER A PECULIAR CHILD WAS SHE NOT I WONDER HOW I TREATED HER
WAS
I FOND OF CHILDREN IN THOSE DAYS WAS THERE ANYTHING GRACIOUS OR KINDLY
ABOUT ME GREAT RECKLESS SCHOOLBOY AS I WAS BUT YOU DON'T RECOLLECT
ME OF COURSE
YOU HAVE SEEN YOUR OWN PICTURE AT LA TERRASSE
IT IS LIKE YOU
PERSONALLY
IN MANNER YOU WERE ALMOST THE SAME YESTERDAY AS TO DAY
BUT LUCY HOW IS THAT SUCH AN ORACLE REALLY WHETS MY CURIOSITY
WHAT
AM I TO DAY WHAT WAS I THE YESTERDAY OF TEN YEARS BACK
GRACIOUS TO WHATEVER PLEASED YOU UNKINDLY OR CRUEL TO NOTHING
THERE YOU ARE WRONG I THINK I WAS ALMOST A BRUTE TO YOU FOR
INSTANCE
A BRUTE NO GRAHAM I SHOULD NEVER HAVE PATIENTLY ENDURED BRUTALITY
THIS HOWEVER I DO REMEMBER QUIET LUCY SNOWE TASTED NOTHING OF
MY GRACE
AS LITTLE OF YOUR CRUELTY
WHY HAD I BEEN NERO HIMSELF I COULD NOT HAVE TORMENTED A BEING
INOFFENSIVE AS A SHADOW
I SMILED BUT I ALSO HUSHED A GROAN
OH I JUST WISHED HE WOULD LET ME
ALONE CEASE ALLUSION TO ME
THESE EPITHETS THESE ATTRIBUTES I PUT
FROM ME
HIS QUIET LUCY SNOWE HIS INOFFENSIVE SHADOW I GAVE HIM
BACK NOT WITH SCORN BUT WITH EXTREME WEARINESS THEIRS WAS THE
COLDNESS AND THE PRESSURE OF LEAD LET HIM WHELM ME WITH NO SUCH
WEIGHT
HAPPILY HE WAS SOON ON ANOTHER THEME
ON WHAT TERMS WERE 'LITTLE POLLY' AND I UNLESS MY RECOLLECTIONS
DECEIVE ME WE WERE NOT FOES
YOU SPEAK VERY VAGUELY
DO YOU THINK LITTLE POLLY'S MEMORY NOT MORE
DEFINITE
OH WE DON'T TALK OF 'LITTLE POLLY' NOW
PRAY SAY MISS DE
BASSOMPIERRE AND OF COURSE SUCH A STATELY PERSONAGE REMEMBERS
NOTHING OF BRETTON
LOOK AT HER LARGE EYES LUCY CAN THEY READ A WORD
IN THE PAGE OF MEMORY ARE THEY THE SAME WHICH I USED TO DIRECT TO A
HORN BOOK SHE DOES NOT KNOW THAT I PARTLY TAUGHT HER TO READ
IN THE BIBLE ON SUNDAY NIGHTS
SHE HAS A CALM DELICATE RATHER FINE PROFILE NOW ONCE WHAT A LITTLE
RESTLESS ANXIOUS COUNTENANCE WAS HERS WHAT A THING IS A CHILD'S
PREFERENCE WHAT A BUBBLE WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT THAT LADY WAS FOND OF
ME
I THINK SHE WAS IN SOME MEASURE FOND OF YOU SAID I MODERATELY
YOU DON'T REMEMBER THEN I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT I REMEMBER NOW
SHE
LIKED ME THE BEST OF WHATEVER THERE WAS AT BRETTON
YOU THOUGHT SO
I QUITE WELL RECALL IT
I WISH I COULD TELL HER ALL I RECALL OR
RATHER I WISH SOME ONE YOU FOR INSTANCE WOULD GO BEHIND AND WHISPER
IT ALL IN HER EAR AND I COULD HAVE THE DELIGHT HERE AS I SIT OF
WATCHING HER LOOK UNDER THE INTELLIGENCE
COULD YOU MANAGE THAT THINK
YOU LUCY AND MAKE ME EVER GRATEFUL
COULD I MANAGE TO MAKE YOU EVER GRATEFUL SAID I
NO I COULD
NOT AND I FELT MY FINGERS WORK AND MY HANDS INTERLOCK I FELT TOO
AN INWARD COURAGE WARM AND RESISTANT
IN THIS MATTER I WAS NOT
DISPOSED TO GRATIFY DR
JOHN NOT AT ALL
WITH NOW WELCOME FORCE I
REALIZED HIS ENTIRE MISAPPREHENSION OF MY CHARACTER AND NATURE
HE
WANTED ALWAYS TO GIVE ME A ROLE NOT MINE
NATURE AND I OPPOSED HIM
HE
DID NOT AT ALL GUESS WHAT I FELT HE DID NOT READ MY EYES OR FACE OR
GESTURES THOUGH I DOUBT NOT ALL SPOKE
LEANING TOWARDS ME COAXINGLY
HE SAID SOFTLY DO CONTENT ME LUCY
AND I WOULD HAVE CONTENTED OR AT LEAST I WOULD CLEARLY HAVE
ENLIGHTENED HIM AND TAUGHT HIM WELL NEVER AGAIN TO EXPECT OF ME THE
PART OF OFFICIOUS SOUBRETTE IN A LOVE DRAMA WHEN FOLLOWING HIS SOFT
EAGER MURMUR MEETING ALMOST HIS PLEADING MELLOW DO CONTENT ME
LUCY A SHARP HISS PIERCED MY EAR ON THE OTHER SIDE
PETITE CHATTE DOUCERETTE COQUETTE SIBILLATED THE SUDDEN
BOA CONSTRICTOR VOUS AVEZ L'AIR BIEN TRISTE SOUMIS RVEUR MAIS
VOUS NE L'TES PAS C'EST MOI QUI VOUS LE DIS SAUVAGE LA FLAMME
L'ME L'CLAIR AUX YEUX
OUI J'AI LA FLAMME L'ME ET JE DOIS L'AVOIR RETORTED I TURNING
IN JUST WRATH BUT PROFESSOR EMANUEL HAD HISSED HIS INSULT AND WAS GONE
THE WORST OF THE MATTER WAS THAT DR
BRETTON WHOSE EARS AS I HAVE
SAID WERE QUICK AND FINE CAUGHT EVERY WORD OF THIS APOSTROPHE HE PUT
HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS FACE AND LAUGHED TILL HE SHOOK
WELL DONE LUCY CRIED HE CAPITAL PETITE CHATTE PETITE COQUETTE
OH I MUST TELL MY MOTHER IS IT TRUE LUCY OR HALF TRUE I BELIEVE IT
IS YOU REDDEN TO THE COLOUR OF MISS FANSHAWE'S GOWN
AND REALLY BY MY
WORD NOW I EXAMINE HIM THAT IS THE SAME LITTLE MAN WHO WAS SO SAVAGE
WITH YOU AT THE CONCERT THE VERY SAME AND IN HIS SOUL HE IS FRANTIC
AT THIS MOMENT BECAUSE HE SEES ME LAUGHING
OH I MUST TEASE HIM
AND GRAHAM YIELDING TO HIS BENT FOR MISCHIEF LAUGHED JESTED AND
WHISPERED ON TILL I COULD BEAR NO MORE AND MY EYES FILLED
SUDDENLY HE WAS SOBERED A VACANT SPACE APPEARED NEAR MISS DE
BASSOMPIERRE THE CIRCLE SURROUNDING HER SEEMED ABOUT TO DISSOLVE
THIS
MOVEMENT WAS INSTANTLY CAUGHT BY GRAHAM'S EYE EVER VIGILANT EVEN
WHILE LAUGHING HE ROSE TOOK HIS COURAGE IN BOTH HANDS CROSSED THE
ROOM AND MADE THE ADVANTAGE HIS OWN
DR
JOHN THROUGHOUT HIS WHOLE
LIFE WAS A MAN OF LUCK A MAN OF SUCCESS
AND WHY BECAUSE HE HAD THE
EYE TO SEE HIS OPPORTUNITY THE HEART TO PROMPT TO WELL TIMED ACTION
THE NERVE TO CONSUMMATE A PERFECT WORK
AND NO TYRANT PASSION DRAGGED
HIM BACK NO ENTHUSIASMS NO FOIBLES ENCUMBERED HIS WAY
HOW WELL HE
LOOKED AT THIS VERY MOMENT WHEN PAULINA LOOKED UP AS HE REACHED HER
SIDE HER GLANCE MINGLED AT ONCE WITH AN ENCOUNTERING GLANCE ANIMATED
YET MODEST HIS COLOUR AS HE SPOKE TO HER BECAME HALF A BLUSH HALF A
GLOW
HE STOOD IN HER PRESENCE BRAVE AND BASHFUL SUBDUED AND
UNOBTRUSIVE YET DECIDED IN HIS PURPOSE AND DEVOTED IN HIS ARDOUR
I
GATHERED ALL THIS BY ONE VIEW
I DID NOT PROLONG MY OBSERVATION TIME
FAILED ME HAD INCLINATION SERVED THE NIGHT WORE LATE GINEVRA AND I
OUGHT ALREADY TO HAVE BEEN IN THE RUE FOSSETTE
I ROSE AND BADE
GOOD NIGHT TO MY GODMOTHER AND M
DE BASSOMPIERRE
I KNOW NOT WHETHER PROFESSOR EMANUEL HAD NOTICED MY RELUCTANT
ACCEPTANCE OF DR
BRETTON'S BADINAGE OR WHETHER HE PERCEIVED THAT I
WAS PAINED AND THAT ON THE WHOLE THE EVENING HAD NOT BEEN ONE FLOW
OF EXULTANT ENJOYMENT FOR THE VOLATILE PLEASURE LOVING MADEMOISELLE
LUCIE BUT AS I WAS LEAVING THE ROOM HE STEPPED UP AND INQUIRED
WHETHER I HAD ANY ONE TO ATTEND ME TO THE RUE FOSSETTE
THE PROFESSOR
NOW SPOKE POLITELY AND EVEN DEFERENTIALLY AND HE LOOKED APOLOGETIC
AND REPENTANT BUT I COULD NOT RECOGNISE HIS CIVILITY AT A WORD NOR
MEET HIS CONTRITION WITH CRUDE PREMATURE OBLIVION
NEVER HITHERTO HAD
I FELT SERIOUSLY DISPOSED TO RESENT HIS BRUSQUERIES OR FREEZE BEFORE
HIS FIERCENESS WHAT HE HAD SAID TO NIGHT HOWEVER I CONSIDERED
UNWARRANTED MY EXTREME DISAPPROBATION OF THE PROCEEDING MUST BE
MARKED HOWEVER SLIGHTLY
I MERELY SAID I AM PROVIDED WITH
ATTENDANCE
WHICH WAS TRUE AS GINEVRA AND I WERE TO BE SENT HOME IN THE CARRIAGE
AND I PASSED HIM WITH THE SLIDING OBEISANCE WITH WHICH HE WAS WONT TO
BE SALUTED IN CLASSE BY PUPILS CROSSING HIS ESTRADE
HAVING SOUGHT MY SHAWL I RETURNED TO THE VESTIBULE
M
EMANUEL STOOD
THERE AS IF WAITING
HE OBSERVED THAT THE NIGHT WAS FINE
IS IT I SAID WITH A TONE AND MANNER WHOSE CONSUMMATE CHARINESS AND
FROSTINESS I COULD NOT BUT APPLAUD
IT WAS SO SELDOM I COULD PROPERLY
ACT OUT MY OWN RESOLUTION TO BE RESERVED AND COOL WHERE I HAD BEEN
GRIEVED OR HURT THAT I FELT ALMOST PROUD OF THIS ONE SUCCESSFUL
EFFORT
THAT IS IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE THE MANNER OF OTHER PEOPLE
I
HAD HEARD HUNDREDS OF SUCH LITTLE MINCED DOCKED DRY PHRASES FROM THE
PURSED UP CORAL LIPS OF A SCORE OF SELF POSSESSED SELF SUFFICING
MISSES AND MESDEMOISELLES
THAT M
PAUL WOULD NOT STAND ANY PROLONGED
EXPERIENCE OF THIS SORT OF DIALOGUE I KNEW BUT HE CERTAINLY MERITED A
SAMPLE OF THE CURT AND ARID
I BELIEVE HE THOUGHT SO HIMSELF FOR HE
TOOK THE DOSE QUIETLY
HE LOOKED AT MY SHAWL AND OBJECTED TO ITS
LIGHTNESS
I DECIDEDLY TOLD HIM IT WAS AS HEAVY AS I WISHED
RECEDING
ALOOF AND STANDING APART I LEANED ON THE BANISTER OF THE STAIRS
FOLDED MY SHAWL ABOUT ME AND FIXED MY EYES ON A DREARY RELIGIOUS
PAINTING DARKENING THE WALL
GINEVRA WAS LONG IN COMING TEDIOUS SEEMED HER LOITERING
M
PAUL WAS
STILL THERE MY EAR EXPECTED FROM HIS LIPS AN ANGRY TONE
HE CAME
NEARER
NOW FOR ANOTHER HISS THOUGHT I HAD NOT THE ACTION BEEN TOO
UNCIVIL I COULD HAVE STOPPED MY EARS WITH MY FINGERS IN TERROR OF THE
THRILL
NOTHING HAPPENS AS WE EXPECT LISTEN FOR A COO OR A MURMUR IT
IS THEN YOU WILL HEAR A CRY OF PREY OR PAIN
AWAIT A PIERCING SHRIEK
AN ANGRY THREAT AND WELCOME AN AMICABLE GREETING A LOW KIND WHISPER
M
PAUL SPOKE GENTLY FRIENDS SAID HE DO NOT QUARREL FOR A WORD
TELL ME WAS IT I OR CE GRAND FAT D'ANGLAIS SO HE PROFANELY
DENOMINATED DR
BRETTON WHO MADE YOUR EYES SO HUMID AND YOUR CHEEKS
SO HOT AS THEY ARE EVEN NOW
I AM NOT CONSCIOUS OF YOU MONSIEUR OR OF ANY OTHER HAVING EXCITED
SUCH EMOTION AS YOU INDICATE WAS MY ANSWER AND IN GIVING IT I AGAIN
SURPASSED MY USUAL SELF AND ACHIEVED A NEAT FROSTY FALSEHOOD
BUT WHAT DID I SAY HE PURSUED TELL ME I WAS ANGRY I HAVE
FORGOTTEN MY WORDS WHAT WERE THEY
SUCH AS IT IS BEST TO FORGET SAID I STILL QUITE CALM AND CHILL
THEN IT WAS MY WORDS WHICH WOUNDED YOU CONSIDER THEM UNSAID PERMIT
MY RETRACTATION ACCORD MY PARDON
I AM NOT ANGRY MONSIEUR
THEN YOU ARE WORSE THAN ANGRY GRIEVED
FORGIVE ME MISS LUCY
M
EMANUEL I DO FORGIVE YOU
LET ME HEAR YOU SAY IN THE VOICE NATURAL TO YOU AND NOT IN THAT
ALIEN TONE 'MON AMI JE VOUS PARDONNE
HE MADE ME SMILE
WHO COULD HELP SMILING AT HIS WISTFULNESS HIS
SIMPLICITY HIS EARNESTNESS
BON HE CRIED
VOIL QUE LE JOUR VA POINDRE DITES DONC MON AMI
MONSIEUR PAUL JE VOUS PARDONNE
I WILL HAVE NO MONSIEUR SPEAK THE OTHER WORD OR I SHALL NOT BELIEVE
YOU SINCERE ANOTHER EFFORT MON AMI OR ELSE IN ENGLISH MY FRIEND
NOW MY FRIEND HAD RATHER ANOTHER SOUND AND SIGNIFICANCY THAN MON
AMI IT DID NOT BREATHE THE SAME SENSE OF DOMESTIC AND INTIMATE
AFFECTION MON AMI I COULD NOT SAY TO M
PAUL MY FRIEND I
COULD AND DID SAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
THIS DISTINCTION EXISTED NOT FOR
HIM HOWEVER AND HE WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE ENGLISH PHRASE
HE
SMILED
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM SMILE READER AND YOU SHOULD HAVE
MARKED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS COUNTENANCE NOW AND THAT HE WORE
HALF AN HOUR AGO
I CANNOT AFFIRM THAT I HAD EVER WITNESSED THE SMILE
OF PLEASURE OR CONTENT OR KINDNESS ROUND M
PAUL'S LIPS OR IN HIS
EYES BEFORE
THE IRONIC THE SARCASTIC THE DISDAINFUL THE
PASSIONATELY EXULTANT I HAD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SEEN HIM EXPRESS BY WHAT
HE CALLED A SMILE BUT ANY ILLUMINATED SIGN OF MILDER OR WARMER
FEELINGS STRUCK ME AS WHOLLY NEW IN HIS VISAGE
IT CHANGED IT AS FROM A
MASK TO A FACE THE DEEP LINES LEFT HIS FEATURES THE VERY COMPLEXION
SEEMED CLEARER AND FRESHER THAT SWART SALLOW SOUTHERN DARKNESS WHICH
SPOKE HIS SPANISH BLOOD BECAME DISPLACED BY A LIGHTER HUE
I KNOW NOT
THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY OTHER HUMAN FACE AN EQUAL METAMORPHOSIS
FROM A SIMILAR CAUSE
HE NOW TOOK ME TO THE CARRIAGE AT THE SAME
MOMENT M
DE BASSOMPIERRE CAME OUT WITH HIS NIECE
IN A PRETTY HUMOUR WAS MISTRESS FANSHAWE SHE HAD FOUND THE EVENING A
GRAND FAILURE COMPLETELY UPSET AS TO TEMPER SHE GAVE WAY TO THE MOST
UNCONTROLLED MOROSENESS AS SOON AS WE WERE SEATED AND THE
CARRIAGE DOOR CLOSED
HER INVECTIVES AGAINST DR
BRETTON HAD SOMETHING
VENOMOUS IN THEM
HAVING FOUND HERSELF IMPOTENT EITHER TO CHARM OR
STING HIM HATRED WAS HER ONLY RESOURCE AND THIS HATRED SHE EXPRESSED
IN TERMS SO UNMEASURED AND PROPORTION SO MONSTROUS THAT AFTER
LISTENING FOR A WHILE WITH ASSUMED STOICISM MY OUTRAGED SENSE OF
JUSTICE AT LAST AND SUDDENLY CAUGHT FIRE
AN EXPLOSION ENSUED FOR I
COULD BE PASSIONATE TOO ESPECIALLY WITH MY PRESENT FAIR BUT FAULTY
ASSOCIATE WHO NEVER FAILED TO STIR THE WORST DREGS OF ME
IT WAS WELL
THAT THE CARRIAGE WHEELS MADE A TREMENDOUS RATTLE OVER THE FLINTY
CHOSEVILLE PAVEMENT FOR I CAN ASSURE THE READER THERE WAS NEITHER DEAD
SILENCE NOR CALM DISCUSSION WITHIN THE VEHICLE
HALF IN EARNEST HALF
IN SEEMING I MADE IT MY BUSINESS TO STORM DOWN GINEVRA
SHE HAD SET
OUT RAMPANT FROM THE RUE CRCY IT WAS NECESSARY TO TAME HER BEFORE WE
REACHED THE RUE FOSSETTE TO THIS END IT WAS INDISPENSABLE TO SHOW UP
HER STERLING VALUE AND HIGH DESERTS AND THIS MUST BE DONE IN LANGUAGE
OF WHICH THE FIDELITY AND HOMELINESS MIGHT CHALLENGE COMPARISON WITH
THE COMPLIMENTS OF A JOHN KNOX TO A MARY STUART
THIS WAS THE RIGHT
DISCIPLINE FOR GINEVRA IT SUITED HER
I AM QUITE SURE SHE WENT TO BED
THAT NIGHT ALL THE BETTER AND MORE SETTLED IN MIND AND MOOD AND SLEPT
ALL THE MORE SWEETLY FOR HAVING UNDERGONE A SOUND MORAL DRUBBING
CHAPTER XXVIII
THE WATCHGUARD
M
PAUL EMANUEL OWNED AN ACUTE SENSITIVENESS TO THE ANNOYANCE OF
INTERRUPTION FROM WHATSOEVER CAUSE OCCURRING DURING HIS LESSONS TO
PASS THROUGH THE CLASSE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WAS CONSIDERED BY THE
TEACHERS AND PUPILS OF THE SCHOOL INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY TO BE
AS MUCH AS A WOMAN'S OR GIRL'S LIFE WAS WORTH
MADAME BECK HERSELF IF FORCED TO THE ENTERPRISE WOULD SKURRY
THROUGH RETRENCHING HER SKIRTS AND CAREFULLY COASTING THE FORMIDABLE
ESTRADE LIKE A SHIP DREADING BREAKERS
AS TO ROSINE THE PORTRESS ON
WHOM EVERY HALF HOUR DEVOLVED THE FEARFUL DUTY OF FETCHING PUPILS OUT
OF THE VERY HEART OF ONE OR OTHER OF THE DIVISIONS TO TAKE THEIR
MUSIC LESSONS IN THE ORATORY THE GREAT OR LITTLE SALOON THE
SALLE MANGER OR SOME OTHER PIANO STATION SHE WOULD UPON HER SECOND
OR THIRD ATTEMPT FREQUENTLY BECOME ALMOST TONGUE TIED FROM EXCESS OF
CONSTERNATION A SENTIMENT INSPIRED BY THE UNSPEAKABLE LOOKS LEVELLED
AT HER THROUGH A PAIR OF DART DEALING SPECTACLES
ONE MORNING I WAS SITTING IN THE CARR AT WORK UPON A PIECE OF
EMBROIDERY WHICH ONE OF THE PUPILS HAD COMMENCED BUT DELAYED TO FINISH
AND WHILE MY FINGERS WROUGHT AT THE FRAME MY EARS REGALED THEMSELVES
WITH LISTENING TO THE CRESCENDOS AND CADENCES OF A VOICE HARANGUING IN
THE NEIGHBOURING CLASSE IN TONES THAT WAXED MOMENTARILY MORE UNQUIET
MORE OMINOUSLY VARIED
THERE WAS A GOOD STRONG PARTITION WALL BETWEEN
ME AND THE GATHERING STORM AS WELL AS A FACILE MEANS OF FLIGHT THROUGH
THE GLASS DOOR TO THE COURT IN CASE IT SWEPT THIS WAY SO I AM AFRAID
I DERIVED MORE AMUSEMENT THAN ALARM FROM THESE THICKENING SYMPTOMS
POOR ROSINE WAS NOT SAFE FOUR TIMES THAT BLESSED MORNING HAD SHE MADE
THE PASSAGE OF PERIL AND NOW FOR THE FIFTH TIME IT BECAME HER
DANGEROUS DUTY TO SNATCH AS IT WERE A BRAND FROM THE BURNING A PUPIL
FROM UNDER M
PAUL'S NOSE
MON DIEU MON DIEU CRIED SHE
QUE VAIS JE DEVENIR MONSIEUR VA ME
TUER JE SUIS SRE CAR IL EST D'UNE COLRE
NERVED BY THE COURAGE OF DESPERATION SHE OPENED THE DOOR
MADEMOISELLE LA MALLE AU PIANO WAS HER CRY
ERE SHE COULD MAKE GOOD HER RETREAT OR QUITE CLOSE THE DOOR THIS
VOICE UTTERED ITSELF
DS CE MOMENT LA CLASSE EST DFENDUE
LA PREMIRE QUI OUVRIRA CETTE
PORTE OU PASSERA PAR CETTE DIVISION SERA PENDUE FUT CE MADAME BECK
ELLE MME
TEN MINUTES HAD NOT SUCCEEDED THE PROMULGATION OF THIS DECREE WHEN
ROSINE'S FRENCH PANTOUFLES WERE AGAIN HEARD SHUFFLING ALONG THE
CORRIDOR
MADEMOISELLE SAID SHE I WOULD NOT FOR A FIVE FRANC PIECE GO INTO
THAT CLASSE AGAIN JUST NOW MONSIEUR'S LUNETTES ARE REALLY TERRIBLE
AND HERE IS A COMMISSIONAIRE COME WITH A MESSAGE FROM THE ATHNE
I
HAVE TOLD MADAME BECK I DARE NOT DELIVER IT AND SHE SAYS I AM TO
CHARGE YOU WITH IT
ME NO THAT IS RATHER TOO BAD IT IS NOT IN MY LINE OF DUTY
COME
COME ROSINE BEAR YOUR OWN BURDEN
BE BRAVE CHARGE ONCE MORE
I MADEMOISELLE IMPOSSIBLE FIVE TIMES I HAVE CROSSED HIM THIS DAY
MADAME MUST REALLY HIRE A GENDARME FOR THIS SERVICE
OUF JE N'EN PUIS
PLUS
BAH YOU ARE ONLY A COWARD
WHAT IS THE MESSAGE
PRECISELY OF THE KIND WITH WHICH MONSIEUR LEAST LIKES TO BE PESTERED
AN URGENT SUMMONS TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE ATHNE AS THERE IS AN
OFFICIAL VISITOR INSPECTOR I KNOW NOT WHAT ARRIVED AND MONSIEUR
MUST MEET HIM YOU KNOW HOW HE HATES A MUST
YES I KNEW WELL ENOUGH
THE RESTIVE LITTLE MAN DETESTED SPUR OR CURB
AGAINST WHATEVER WAS URGENT OR OBLIGATORY HE WAS SURE TO REVOLT
HOWEVER I ACCEPTED THE RESPONSIBILITY NOT CERTAINLY WITHOUT FEAR
BUT FEAR BLENT WITH OTHER SENTIMENTS CURIOSITY AMONGST THEM
I OPENED
THE DOOR I ENTERED I CLOSED IT BEHIND ME AS QUICKLY AND QUIETLY AS A
RATHER UNSTEADY HAND WOULD PERMIT FOR TO BE SLOW OR BUSTLING TO
RATTLE A LATCH OR LEAVE A DOOR GAPING WIDE WERE AGGRAVATIONS OF CRIME
OFTEN MORE DISASTROUS IN RESULT THAN THE MAIN CRIME ITSELF
THERE I
STOOD THEN AND THERE HE SAT HIS HUMOUR WAS VISIBLY BAD ALMOST AT ITS
WORST HE HAD BEEN GIVING A LESSON IN ARITHMETIC FOR HE GAVE LESSONS
ON ANY AND EVERY SUBJECT THAT STRUCK HIS FANCY AND ARITHMETIC BEING A
DRY SUBJECT INVARIABLY DISAGREED WITH HIM NOT A PUPIL BUT TREMBLED
WHEN HE SPOKE OF FIGURES
HE SAT BENT ABOVE HIS DESK TO LOOK UP AT
THE SOUND OF AN ENTRANCE AT THE OCCURRENCE OF A DIRECT BREACH OF HIS
WILL AND LAW WAS AN EFFORT HE COULD NOT FOR THE MOMENT BRING HIMSELF
TO MAKE
IT WAS QUITE AS WELL I THUS GAINED TIME TO WALK UP THE LONG
CLASSE AND IT SUITED MY IDIOSYNCRACY FAR BETTER TO ENCOUNTER THE NEAR
BURST OF ANGER LIKE HIS THAN TO BEAR ITS MENACE AT A DISTANCE
AT HIS ESTRADE I PAUSED JUST IN FRONT OF COURSE I WAS NOT WORTHY OF
IMMEDIATE ATTENTION HE PROCEEDED WITH HIS LESSON
DISDAIN WOULD NOT
DO HE MUST HEAR AND HE MUST ANSWER MY MESSAGE
NOT BEING QUITE TALL ENOUGH TO LIFT MY HEAD OVER HIS DESK ELEVATED
UPON THE ESTRADE AND THUS SUFFERING ECLIPSE IN MY PRESENT POSITION I
VENTURED TO PEEP ROUND WITH THE DESIGN AT FIRST OF MERELY GETTING A
BETTER VIEW OF HIS FACE WHICH HAD STRUCK ME WHEN I ENTERED AS BEARING
A CLOSE AND PICTURESQUE RESEMBLANCE TO THAT OF A BLACK AND SALLOW
TIGER
TWICE DID I ENJOY THIS SIDE VIEW WITH IMPUNITY ADVANCING AND
RECEDING UNSEEN THE THIRD TIME MY EYE HAD SCARCE DAWNED BEYOND THE
OBSCURATION OF THE DESK WHEN IT WAS CAUGHT AND TRANSFIXED THROUGH ITS
VERY PUPIL TRANSFIXED BY THE LUNETTES ROSINE WAS RIGHT THESE
UTENSILS HAD IN THEM A BLANK AND IMMUTABLE TERROR BEYOND THE MOBILE
WRATH OF THE WEARER'S OWN UNGLAZED EYES
I NOW FOUND THE ADVANTAGE OF PROXIMITY THESE SHORT SIGHTED LUNETTES
WERE USELESS FOR THE INSPECTION OF A CRIMINAL UNDER MONSIEUR'S NOSE
ACCORDINGLY HE DOFFED THEM AND HE AND I STOOD ON MORE EQUAL TERMS
I AM GLAD I WAS NOT REALLY MUCH AFRAID OF HIM THAT INDEED CLOSE IN
HIS PRESENCE I FELT NO TERROR AT ALL FOR UPON HIS DEMANDING CORD AND
GIBBET TO EXECUTE THE SENTENCE RECENTLY PRONOUNCED I WAS ABLE TO
FURNISH HIM WITH A NEEDLEFUL OF EMBROIDERING THREAD WITH SUCH
ACCOMMODATING CIVILITY AS COULD NOT BUT ALLAY SOME PORTION AT LEAST OF
HIS SURPLUS IRRITATION
OF COURSE I DID NOT PARADE THIS COURTESY BEFORE
PUBLIC VIEW I MERELY HANDED THE THREAD ROUND THE ANGLE OF THE DESK
AND ATTACHED IT READY NOOSED TO THE BARRED BACK OF THE PROFESSOR'S
CHAIR
QUE ME VOULEZ VOUS SAID HE IN A GROWL OF WHICH THE MUSIC WAS WHOLLY
CONFINED TO HIS CHEST AND THROAT FOR HE KEPT HIS TEETH CLENCHED AND
SEEMED REGISTERING TO HIMSELF AN INWARD VOW THAT NOTHING EARTHLY SHOULD
WRING FROM HIM A SMILE
MY ANSWER COMMENCED UNCOMPROMISINGLY MONSIEUR I SAID JE VEUX
L'IMPOSSIBLE DES CHOSES INOUES AND THINKING IT BEST NOT TO MINCE
MATTERS BUT TO ADMINISTER THE DOUCHE WITH DECISION IN A LOW BUT
QUICK VOICE I DELIVERED THE ATHENIAN MESSAGE FLORIDLY EXAGGERATING
ITS URGENCY
OF COURSE HE WOULD NOT HEAR A WORD OF IT
HE WOULD NOT GO HE WOULD
NOT LEAVE HIS PRESENT CLASS LET ALL THE OFFICIALS OF VILLETTE SEND FOR
HIM
HE WOULD NOT PUT HIMSELF AN INCH OUT OF HIS WAY AT THE BIDDING OF
KING CABINET AND CHAMBERS TOGETHER
I KNEW HOWEVER THAT HE MUST GO THAT TALK AS HE WOULD BOTH HIS
DUTY AND INTEREST COMMANDED AN IMMEDIATE AND LITERAL COMPLIANCE WITH
THE SUMMONS I STOOD THEREFORE WAITING IN SILENCE AS IF HE HAD NOT
YET SPOKEN
HE ASKED WHAT MORE I WANTED
ONLY MONSIEUR'S ANSWER TO DELIVER TO THE COMMISSIONAIRE
HE WAVED AN IMPATIENT NEGATIVE
I VENTURED TO STRETCH MY HAND TO THE BONNET GREC WHICH LAY IN GRIM
REPOSE ON THE WINDOW SILL
HE FOLLOWED THIS DARING MOVEMENT WITH HIS
EYE NO DOUBT IN MIXED PITY AND AMAZEMENT AT ITS PRESUMPTION
AH HE MUTTERED IF IT CAME TO THAT IF MISS LUCY MEDDLED WITH HIS
BONNET GREC SHE MIGHT JUST PUT IT ON HERSELF TURN GARON FOR THE
OCCASION AND BENEVOLENTLY GO TO THE ATHNE IN HIS STEAD
WITH GREAT RESPECT I LAID THE BONNET ON THE DESK WHERE ITS TASSEL
SEEMED TO GIVE ME AN AWFUL NOD
I'LL WRITE A NOTE OF APOLOGY THAT WILL DO SAID HE STILL BENT ON
EVASION
KNOWING WELL IT WOULD NOT DO I GENTLY PUSHED THE BONNET TOWARDS HIS
HAND
THUS IMPELLED IT SLID DOWN THE POLISHED SLOPE OF THE VARNISHED
AND UNBAIZED DESK CARRIED BEFORE IT THE LIGHT STEEL FRAMED LUNETTES
AND FEARFUL TO RELATE THEY FELL TO THE ESTRADE
A SCORE OF TIMES ERE
NOW HAD I SEEN THEM FALL AND RECEIVE NO DAMAGE THIS TIME AS LUCY
SNOWE'S HAPLESS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THEY SO FELL THAT EACH CLEAR PEBBLE
BECAME A SHIVERED AND SHAPELESS STAR
NOW INDEED DISMAY SEIZED ME DISMAY AND REGRET
I KNEW THE VALUE OF
THESE LUNETTES M
PAUL'S SIGHT WAS PECULIAR NOT EASILY FITTED AND
THESE GLASSES SUITED HIM
I HAD HEARD HIM CALL THEM HIS TREASURES AS I
PICKED THEM UP CRACKED AND WORTHLESS MY HAND TREMBLED
FRIGHTENED
THROUGH ALL MY NERVES I WAS TO SEE THE MISCHIEF I HAD DONE BUT I THINK
I WAS EVEN MORE SORRY THAN AFRAID
FOR SOME SECONDS I DARED NOT LOOK
THE BEREAVED PROFESSOR IN THE FACE HE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
L SAID HE ME VOIL VEUF DE MES LUNETTES I THINK MADEMOISELLE
LUCY WILL NOW CONFESS THAT THE CORD AND GALLOWS ARE AMPLY EARNED SHE
TREMBLES IN ANTICIPATION OF HER DOOM
AH TRAITRESS TRAITRESS YOU ARE
RESOLVED TO HAVE ME QUITE BLIND AND HELPLESS IN YOUR HANDS
I LIFTED MY EYES HIS FACE INSTEAD OF BEING IRATE LOWERING AND
FURROWED WAS OVERFLOWING WITH THE SMILE COLOURED WITH THE BLOOM I HAD
SEEN BRIGHTENING IT THAT EVENING AT THE HOTEL CRCY
HE WAS NOT
ANGRY NOT EVEN GRIEVED
FOR THE REAL INJURY HE SHOWED HIMSELF FULL OF
CLEMENCY UNDER THE REAL PROVOCATION PATIENT AS A SAINT
THIS EVENT
WHICH SEEMED SO UNTOWARD WHICH I THOUGHT HAD RUINED AT ONCE MY CHANCE
OF SUCCESSFUL PERSUASION PROVED MY BEST HELP
DIFFICULT OF MANAGEMENT
SO LONG AS I HAD DONE HIM NO HARM HE BECAME GRACIOUSLY PLIANT AS SOON
AS I STOOD IN HIS PRESENCE A CONSCIOUS AND CONTRITE OFFENDER
STILL GENTLY RAILING AT ME AS UNE FORTE FEMME UNE ANGLAISE
TERRIBLE UNE PETITE CASSE TOUT HE DECLARED THAT HE DARED NOT BUT
OBEY ONE WHO HAD GIVEN SUCH AN INSTANCE OF HER DANGEROUS PROWESS IT
WAS ABSOLUTELY LIKE THE GRAND EMPEREUR SMASHING THE VASE TO INSPIRE
DISMAY SO AT LAST CROWNING HIMSELF WITH HIS BONNET GREC AND TAKING
HIS RUINED LUNETTES FROM MY HAND WITH A CLASP OF KIND PARDON AND
ENCOURAGEMENT HE MADE HIS BOW AND WENT OFF TO THE ATHNE IN
FIRST RATE HUMOUR AND SPIRITS
AFTER ALL THIS AMIABILITY THE READER WILL BE SORRY FOR MY SAKE TO HEAR
THAT I WAS QUARRELLING WITH M
PAUL AGAIN BEFORE NIGHT YET SO IT WAS
AND I COULD NOT HELP IT
IT WAS HIS OCCASIONAL CUSTOM AND A VERY LAUDABLE ACCEPTABLE CUSTOM
TOO TO ARRIVE OF AN EVENING ALWAYS L'IMPROVISTE UNANNOUNCED BURST
IN ON THE SILENT HOUR OF STUDY ESTABLISH A SUDDEN DESPOTISM OVER US
AND OUR OCCUPATIONS CAUSE BOOKS TO BE PUT AWAY WORK BAGS TO BE
BROUGHT OUT AND DRAWING FORTH A SINGLE THICK VOLUME OR A HANDFUL OF
PAMPHLETS SUBSTITUTE FOR THE BESOTTED LECTURE PIEUSE DRAWLED BY A
SLEEPY PUPIL SOME TRAGEDY MADE GRAND BY GRAND READING ARDENT BY FIERY
ACTION SOME DRAMA WHEREOF FOR MY PART I RARELY STUDIED THE
INTRINSIC MERIT FOR M
EMANUEL MADE IT A VESSEL FOR AN OUTPOURING AND
FILLED IT WITH HIS NATIVE VERVE AND PASSION LIKE A CUP WITH A VITAL
BREWAGE
OR ELSE HE WOULD FLASH THROUGH OUR CONVENTUAL DARKNESS A
REFLEX OF A BRIGHTER WORLD SHOW US A GLIMPSE OF THE CURRENT LITERATURE
OF THE DAY READ US PASSAGES FROM SOME ENCHANTING TALE OR THE LAST
WITTY FEUILLETON WHICH HAD AWAKENED LAUGHTER IN THE SALOONS OF PARIS
TAKING CARE ALWAYS TO EXPUNGE WITH THE SEVEREST HAND WHETHER FROM
TRAGEDY MELODRAMA TALE OR ESSAY WHATEVER PASSAGE PHRASE OR WORD
COULD BE DEEMED UNSUITED TO AN AUDIENCE OF JEUNES FILLES I NOTICED
MORE THAN ONCE THAT WHERE RETRENCHMENT WITHOUT SUBSTITUTE WOULD HAVE
LEFT UNMEANING VACANCY OR INTRODUCED WEAKNESS HE COULD AND DID
IMPROVISE WHOLE PARAGRAPHS NO LESS VIGOROUS THAN IRREPROACHABLE THE
DIALOGUE THE DESCRIPTION HE ENGRAFTED WAS OFTEN FAR BETTER THAN THAT
HE PRUNED AWAY
WELL ON THE EVENING IN QUESTION WE WERE SITTING SILENT AS NUNS IN A
RETREAT THE PUPILS STUDYING THE TEACHERS WORKING
I REMEMBER MY
WORK IT WAS A SLIGHT MATTER OF FANCY AND IT RATHER INTERESTED ME IT
HAD A PURPOSE I WAS NOT DOING IT MERELY TO KILL TIME I MEANT IT WHEN
FINISHED AS A GIFT AND THE OCCASION OF PRESENTATION BEING NEAR HASTE
WAS REQUISITE AND MY FINGERS WERE BUSY
WE HEARD THE SHARP BELL PEAL WHICH WE ALL KNEW THEN THE RAPID STEP
FAMILIAR TO EACH EAR THE WORDS VOIL MONSIEUR HAD SCARCELY BROKEN
SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM EVERY LIP WHEN THE TWO LEAVED DOOR SPLIT AS SPLIT
IT ALWAYS DID FOR HIS ADMISSION SUCH A SLOW WORD AS OPEN IS
INEFFICIENT TO DESCRIBE HIS MOVEMENTS AND HE STOOD IN THE MIDST OF US
THERE WERE TWO STUDY TABLES BOTH LONG AND FLANKED WITH BENCHES OVER
THE CENTRE OF EACH HUNG A LAMP BENEATH THIS LAMP ON EITHER SIDE THE
TABLE SAT A TEACHER THE GIRLS WERE ARRANGED TO THE RIGHT HAND AND THE
LEFT THE ELDEST AND MOST STUDIOUS NEAREST THE LAMPS OR TROPICS THE
IDLERS AND LITTLE ONES TOWARDS THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLES
MONSIEUR'S
HABIT WAS POLITELY TO HAND A CHAIR TO SOME TEACHER GENERALLY ZLIE ST
PIERRE THE SENIOR MISTRESS THEN TO TAKE HER VACATED SEAT AND THUS
AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE FULL BEAM OF CANCER OR CAPRICORN WHICH OWING TO
HIS NEAR SIGHT HE NEEDED
AS USUAL ZLIE ROSE WITH ALACRITY SMILING TO THE WHOLE EXTENT OF HER
MOUTH AND THE FULL DISPLAY OF HER UPPER AND UNDER ROWS OF TEETH THAT
STRANGE SMILE WHICH PASSES FROM EAR TO EAR AND IS MARKED ONLY BY A
SHARP THIN CURVE WHICH FAILS TO SPREAD OVER THE COUNTENANCE AND
NEITHER DIMPLES THE CHEEK NOR LIGHTS THE EYE
I SUPPOSE MONSIEUR DID
NOT SEE HER OR HE HAD TAKEN A WHIM THAT HE WOULD NOT NOTICE HER FOR
HE WAS AS CAPRICIOUS AS WOMEN ARE SAID TO BE THEN HIS LUNETTES HE
HAD GOT ANOTHER PAIR SERVED HIM AS AN EXCUSE FOR ALL SORTS OF LITTLE
OVERSIGHTS AND SHORTCOMINGS
WHATEVER MIGHT BE HIS REASON HE PASSED BY
ZLIE CAME TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE AND BEFORE I COULD START UP
TO CLEAR THE WAY WHISPERED NE BOUGEZ PAS AND ESTABLISHED HIMSELF
BETWEEN ME AND MISS FANSHAWE WHO ALWAYS WOULD BE MY NEIGHBOUR AND
HAVE HER ELBOW IN MY SIDE HOWEVER OFTEN I DECLARED TO HER GINEVRA I
WISH YOU WERE AT JERICHO
IT WAS EASY TO SAY NE BOUGEZ PAS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT I MUST
MAKE HIM ROOM AND I MUST REQUEST THE PUPILS TO RECEDE THAT I MIGHT
RECEDE
IT WAS VERY WELL FOR GINEVRA TO BE GUMMED TO ME KEEPING
HERSELF WARM AS SHE SAID ON THE WINTER EVENINGS AND HARASSING MY
VERY HEART WITH HER FIDGETINGS AND POKINGS OBLIGING ME INDEED
SOMETIMES TO PUT AN ARTFUL PIN IN MY GIRDLE BY WAY OF PROTECTION
AGAINST HER ELBOW BUT I SUPPOSE M
EMANUEL WAS NOT TO BE SUBJECTED TO
THE SAME KIND OF TREATMENT SO I SWEPT AWAY MY WORKING MATERIALS TO
CLEAR SPACE FOR HIS BOOK AND WITHDREW MYSELF TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIS
PERSON NOT HOWEVER LEAVING MORE THAN A YARD OF INTERVAL JUST WHAT
ANY REASONABLE MAN WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS A CONVENIENT RESPECTFUL
ALLOWANCE OF BENCH
BUT M
EMANUEL NEVER WAS REASONABLE FLINT AND
TINDER THAT HE WAS HE STRUCK AND TOOK FIRE DIRECTLY
VOUS NE VOULEZ PAS DE MOI POUR VOISIN HE GROWLED VOUS VOUS DONNEZ
DES AIRS DE CASTE VOUS ME TRAITEZ EN PARIA HE SCOWLED
SOIT JE
VAIS ARRANGER LA CHOSE AND HE SET TO WORK
LEVEZ VOUS TOUTES MESDEMOISELLES CRIED HE
THE GIRLS ROSE
HE MADE THEM ALL FILE OFF TO THE OTHER TABLE
HE THEN
PLACED ME AT ONE EXTREMITY OF THE LONG BENCH AND HAVING DULY AND
CAREFULLY BROUGHT ME MY WORK BASKET SILK SCISSORS ALL MY IMPLEMENTS
HE FIXED HIMSELF QUITE AT THE OTHER END
AT THIS ARRANGEMENT HIGHLY ABSURD AS IT WAS NOT A SOUL IN THE ROOM
DARED TO LAUGH LUCKLESS FOR THE GIGGLER WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GIGGLE
AS
FOR ME I TOOK IT WITH ENTIRE COOLNESS
THERE I SAT ISOLATED AND CUT
OFF FROM HUMAN INTERCOURSE I SAT AND MINDED MY WORK AND WAS QUIET
AND NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY
EST CE ASSEZ DE DISTANCE HE DEMANDED
MONSIEUR EN EST L'ARBITRE SAID I
VOUS SAVEZ BIEN QUE NON
C'EST VOUS QUI AVEZ CRE CE VIDE IMMENSE MOI
JE N'Y AI PAS MIS LA MAIN
AND WITH THIS ASSERTION HE COMMENCED THE READING
FOR HIS MISFORTUNE HE HAD CHOSEN A FRENCH TRANSLATION OF WHAT HE CALLED
UN DRAME DE WILLIAMS SHACKSPIRE LE FAUX DIEU HE FURTHER ANNOUNCED
DE CES SOTS PAENS LES ANGLAIS HOW FAR OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE
CHARACTERIZED HIM HAD HIS TEMPER NOT BEEN UPSET I SCARCELY NEED
INTIMATE
OF COURSE THE TRANSLATION BEING FRENCH WAS VERY INEFFICIENT NOR DID
I MAKE ANY PARTICULAR EFFORT TO CONCEAL THE CONTEMPT WHICH SOME OF ITS
FORLORN LAPSES WERE CALCULATED TO EXCITE
NOT THAT IT BEHOVED OR
BESEEMED ME TO SAY ANYTHING BUT ONE CAN OCCASIONALLY LOOK THE
OPINION IT IS FORBIDDEN TO EMBODY IN WORDS
MONSIEUR'S LUNETTES BEING
ON THE ALERT HE GLEANED UP EVERY STRAY LOOK I DON'T THINK HE LOST
ONE THE CONSEQUENCE WAS HIS EYES SOON DISCARDED A SCREEN THAT THEIR
BLAZE MIGHT SPARKLE FREE AND HE WAXED HOTTER AT THE NORTH POLE TO
WHICH HE HAD VOLUNTARILY EXILED HIMSELF THAN CONSIDERING THE GENERAL
TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLE TO BECOME UNDER
THE VERTICAL RAY OF CANCER ITSELF
THE READING OVER IT APPEARED PROBLEMATIC WHETHER HE WOULD DEPART WITH
HIS ANGER UNEXPRESSED OR WHETHER HE WOULD GIVE IT VENT
SUPPRESSION
WAS NOT MUCH IN HIS HABITS BUT STILL WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO HIM
DEFINITE ENOUGH TO AFFORD MATTER FOR OVERT REPROOF I HAD NOT UTTERED A
SOUND AND COULD NOT JUSTLY BE DEEMED AMENABLE TO REPRIMAND OR PENALTY
FOR HAVING PERMITTED A SLIGHTLY FREER ACTION THAN USUAL TO THE MUSCLES
ABOUT MY EYES AND MOUTH
THE SUPPER CONSISTING OF BREAD AND MILK DILUTED WITH TEPID WATER WAS
BROUGHT IN
IN RESPECTFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE PROFESSOR'S PRESENCE
THE ROLLS AND GLASSES WERE ALLOWED TO STAND INSTEAD OF BEING
IMMEDIATELY HANDED ROUND
TAKE YOUR SUPPER LADIES SAID HE SEEMING TO BE OCCUPIED IN MAKING
MARGINAL NOTES TO HIS WILLIAMS SHACKSPIRE THEY TOOK IT
I ALSO
ACCEPTED A ROLL AND GLASS BUT BEING NOW MORE THAN EVER INTERESTED IN
MY WORK I KEPT MY SEAT OF PUNISHMENT AND WROUGHT WHILE I MUNCHED MY
BREAD AND SIPPED MY BEVERAGE THE WHOLE WITH EASY SANG FROID WITH A
CERTAIN SNUGNESS OF COMPOSURE INDEED SCARCELY IN MY HABITS AND
PLEASANTLY NOVEL TO MY FEELINGS
IT SEEMED AS IF THE PRESENCE OF A
NATURE SO RESTLESS CHAFING THORNY AS THAT OF M
PAUL ABSORBED ALL
FEVERISH AND UNSETTLING INFLUENCES LIKE A MAGNET AND LEFT ME NONE BUT
SUCH AS WERE PLACID AND HARMONIOUS
HE ROSE
WILL HE GO AWAY WITHOUT SAYING ANOTHER WORD YES HE TURNED
TO THE DOOR
NO HE RE TURNED ON HIS STEPS BUT ONLY PERHAPS TO TAKE HIS
PENCIL CASE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE TABLE
HE TOOK IT SHUT THE PENCIL IN AND OUT BROKE ITS POINT AGAINST THE
WOOD RE CUT AND POCKETED IT AND
WALKED PROMPTLY UP TO ME
THE GIRLS AND TEACHERS GATHERED ROUND THE OTHER TABLE WERE TALKING
PRETTY FREELY THEY ALWAYS TALKED AT MEALS AND FROM THE CONSTANT
HABIT OF SPEAKING FAST AND LOUD AT SUCH TIMES DID NOT NOW SUBDUE THEIR
VOICES MUCH
M
PAUL CAME AND STOOD BEHIND ME
HE ASKED AT WHAT I WAS WORKING AND I
SAID I WAS MAKING A WATCHGUARD
HE ASKED FOR WHOM AND I ANSWERED FOR A GENTLEMAN ONE OF MY
FRIENDS
M
PAUL STOOPED DOWN AND PROCEEDED AS NOVEL WRITERS SAY AND AS WAS
LITERALLY TRUE IN HIS CASE TO HISS INTO MY EAR SOME POIGNANT WORDS
HE SAID THAT OF ALL THE WOMEN HE KNEW I WAS THE ONE WHO COULD MAKE
HERSELF THE MOST CONSUMMATELY UNPLEASANT I WAS SHE WITH WHOM IT WAS
LEAST POSSIBLE TO LIVE ON FRIENDLY TERMS
I HAD A CARACTRE
INTRAITABLE AND PERVERSE TO A MIRACLE
HOW I MANAGED IT OR WHAT
POSSESSED ME HE FOR HIS PART DID NOT KNOW BUT WITH WHATEVER PACIFIC
AND AMICABLE INTENTIONS A PERSON ACCOSTED ME CRAC I TURNED CONCORD TO
DISCORD GOOD WILL TO ENMITY
HE WAS SURE HE M
PAUL WISHED ME WELL
ENOUGH HE HAD NEVER DONE ME ANY HARM THAT HE KNEW OF HE MIGHT AT
LEAST HE SUPPOSED CLAIM A RIGHT TO BE REGARDED AS A NEUTRAL
ACQUAINTANCE GUILTLESS OF HOSTILE SENTIMENTS YET HOW I BEHAVED TO
HIM WITH WHAT PUNGENT VIVACITIES WHAT AN IMPETUS OF MUTINY WHAT A
FOUGUE OF INJUSTICE
HERE I COULD NOT AVOID OPENING MY EYES SOMEWHAT WIDE AND EVEN SLIPPING
IN A SLIGHT INTERJECTIONAL OBSERVATION VIVACITIES IMPETUS FOUGUE I
DIDN'T KNOW
CHUT L'INSTANT THERE THERE I WENT VIVE COMME LA POUDRE HE WAS
SORRY HE WAS VERY SORRY FOR MY SAKE HE GRIEVED OVER THE HAPLESS
PECULIARITY
THIS EMPORTEMENT THIS CHALEUR GENEROUS PERHAPS BUT
EXCESSIVE WOULD YET HE FEARED DO ME A MISCHIEF
IT WAS A PITY I WAS
NOT HE BELIEVED IN HIS SOUL WHOLLY WITHOUT GOOD QUALITIES AND WOULD
I BUT HEAR REASON AND BE MORE SEDATE MORE SOBER LESS EN L'AIR
LESS COQUETTE LESS TAKEN BY SHOW LESS PRONE TO SET AN UNDUE VALUE
ON OUTSIDE EXCELLENCE TO MAKE MUCH OF THE ATTENTIONS OF PEOPLE
REMARKABLE CHIEFLY FOR SO MANY FEET OF STATURE DES COULEURS DE
POUPE UN NEZ PLUS OU MOINS BIEN FAIT AND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF
FATUITY I MIGHT YET PROVE AN USEFUL PERHAPS AN EXEMPLARY CHARACTER
BUT AS IT WAS AND HERE THE LITTLE MAN'S VOICE WAS FOR A MINUTE
CHOKED
I WOULD HAVE LOOKED UP AT HIM OR HELD OUT MY HAND OR SAID A SOOTHING
WORD BUT I WAS AFRAID IF I STIRRED I SHOULD EITHER LAUGH OR CRY SO
ODD IN ALL THIS WAS THE MIXTURE OF THE TOUCHING AND THE ABSURD
I THOUGHT HE HAD NEARLY DONE BUT NO HE SAT DOWN THAT HE MIGHT GO ON
AT HIS EASE
WHILE HE M
PAUL WAS ON THESE PAINFUL TOPICS HE WOULD DARE MY ANGER
FOR THE SAKE OF MY GOOD AND WOULD VENTURE TO REFER TO A CHANGE HE HAD
NOTICED IN MY DRESS
HE WAS FREE TO CONFESS THAT WHEN HE FIRST KNEW
ME OR RATHER WAS IN THE HABIT OF CATCHING A PASSING GLIMPSE OF ME
FROM TIME TO TIME I SATISFIED HIM ON THIS POINT THE GRAVITY THE
AUSTERE SIMPLICITY OBVIOUS IN THIS PARTICULAR WERE SUCH AS TO INSPIRE
THE HIGHEST HOPES FOR MY BEST INTERESTS
WHAT FATAL INFLUENCE HAD
IMPELLED ME LATELY TO INTRODUCE FLOWERS UNDER THE BRIM OF MY BONNET TO
WEAR 'DES COLS BRODS AND EVEN TO APPEAR ON ONE OCCASION IN A
SCARLET GOWN HE MIGHT INDEED CONJECTURE BUT FOR THE PRESENT WOULD
NOT OPENLY DECLARE
AGAIN I INTERRUPTED AND THIS TIME NOT WITHOUT AN ACCENT AT ONCE
INDIGNANT AND HORROR STRUCK
SCARLET MONSIEUR PAUL IT WAS NOT SCARLET IT WAS PINK AND PALE PINK
TO AND FURTHER SUBDUED BY BLACK LACE
PINK OR SCARLET YELLOW OR CRIMSON PEA GREEN OR SKY BLUE IT WAS ALL
ONE THESE WERE ALL FLAUNTING GIDDY COLOURS AND AS TO THE LACE I
TALKED OF THAT WAS BUT A 'COLIFICHET DE PLUS AND HE SIGHED OVER
MY DEGENERACY
HE COULD NOT HE WAS SORRY TO SAY BE SO PARTICULAR ON
THIS THEME AS HE COULD WISH NOT POSSESSING THE EXACT NAMES OF THESE
'BABIOLES HE MIGHT RUN INTO SMALL VERBAL ERRORS WHICH WOULD NOT FAIL
TO LAY HIM OPEN TO MY SARCASM AND EXCITE MY UNHAPPILY SUDDEN AND
PASSIONATE DISPOSITION
HE WOULD MERELY SAY IN GENERAL TERMS AND IN
THESE GENERAL TERMS HE KNEW HE WAS CORRECT THAT MY COSTUME HAD OF LATE
ASSUMED 'DES FAONS MONDAINES WHICH IT WOUNDED HIM TO SEE
WHAT FAONS MONDAINES HE DISCOVERED IN MY PRESENT WINTER MERINO AND
PLAIN WHITE COLLAR I OWN IT PUZZLED ME TO GUESS AND WHEN I ASKED HIM
HE SAID IT WAS ALL MADE WITH TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO EFFECT AND BESIDES
HAD I NOT A BOW OF RIBBON AT MY NECK
AND IF YOU CONDEMN A BOW OF RIBBON FOR A LADY MONSIEUR YOU WOULD
NECESSARILY DISAPPROVE OF A THING LIKE THIS FOR A GENTLEMAN HOLDING
UP MY BRIGHT LITTLE CHAINLET OF SILK AND GOLD
HIS SOLE REPLY WAS A
GROAN I SUPPOSE OVER MY LEVITY
AFTER SITTING SOME MINUTES IN SILENCE AND WATCHING THE PROGRESS OF THE
CHAIN AT WHICH I NOW WROUGHT MORE ASSIDUOUSLY THAN EVER HE INQUIRED
WHETHER WHAT HE HAD JUST SAID WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF MAKING ME
ENTIRELY DETEST HIM
I HARDLY REMEMBER WHAT ANSWER I MADE OR HOW IT CAME ABOUT I DON'T
THINK I SPOKE AT ALL BUT I KNOW WE MANAGED TO BID GOOD NIGHT ON
FRIENDLY TERMS AND EVEN AFTER M
PAUL HAD REACHED THE DOOR HE TURNED
BACK JUST TO EXPLAIN THAT HE WOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD TO SPEAK IN
ENTIRE CONDEMNATION OF THE SCARLET DRESS PINK PINK I THREW IN
THAT HE HAD NO INTENTION TO DENY IT THE MERIT OF LOOKING RATHER
WELL THE FACT WAS M
EMANUEL'S TASTE IN COLOURS DECIDEDLY LEANED TO
THE BRILLIANT ONLY HE WISHED TO COUNSEL ME WHENEVER I WORE IT TO
DO SO IN THE SAME SPIRIT AS IF ITS MATERIAL WERE 'BURE AND ITS HUE
'GRIS DE POUSSIRE
AND THE FLOWERS UNDER MY BONNET MONSIEUR I ASKED
THEY ARE VERY
LITTLE ONES
KEEP THEM LITTLE THEN SAID HE
PERMIT THEM NOT TO BECOME
FULL BLOWN
AND THE BOW MONSIEUR THE BIT OF RIBBON
VA POUR LE RUBAN WAS THE PROPITIOUS ANSWER
AND SO WE SETTLED IT
WELL DONE LUCY SNOWE CRIED I TO MYSELF YOU HAVE COME IN FOR A
PRETTY LECTURE BROUGHT ON YOURSELF A 'RUDE SAVANT AND ALL THROUGH
YOUR WICKED FONDNESS FOR WORLDLY VANITIES WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT
YOU DEEMED YOURSELF A MELANCHOLY SOBER SIDES ENOUGH MISS FANSHAWE
THERE REGARDS YOU AS A SECOND DIOGENES
M
DE BASSOMPIERRE THE OTHER
DAY POLITELY TURNED THE CONVERSATION WHEN IT RAN ON THE WILD GIFTS OF
THE ACTRESS VASHTI BECAUSE AS HE KINDLY SAID 'MISS SNOWE LOOKED
UNCOMFORTABLE DR
JOHN BRETTON KNOWS YOU ONLY AS 'QUIET LUCY' 'A
CREATURE INOFFENSIVE AS A SHADOW HE HAS SAID AND YOU HAVE HEARD HIM
SAY IT 'LUCY'S DISADVANTAGES SPRING FROM OVER GRAVITY IN TASTES AND
MANNER WANT OF COLOUR IN CHARACTER AND COSTUME SUCH ARE YOUR OWN AND
YOUR FRIENDS' IMPRESSIONS AND BEHOLD THERE STARTS UP A LITTLE MAN
DIFFERING DIAMETRICALLY FROM ALL THESE ROUNDLY CHARGING YOU WITH BEING
TOO AIRY AND CHEERY TOO VOLATILE AND VERSATILE TOO FLOWERY AND
COLOURY
THIS HARSH LITTLE MAN THIS PITILESS CENSOR GATHERS UP ALL
YOUR POOR SCATTERED SINS OF VANITY YOUR LUCKLESS CHIFFON OF
ROSE COLOUR YOUR SMALL FRINGE OF A WREATH YOUR SMALL SCRAP OF RIBBON
YOUR SILLY BIT OF LACE AND CALLS YOU TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LOT AND FOR
EACH ITEM
YOU ARE WELL HABITUATED TO BE PASSED BY AS A SHADOW IN
LIFE'S SUNSHINE IT ITS A NEW THING TO SEE ONE TESTILY LIFTING HIS HAND
TO SCREEN HIS EYES BECAUSE YOU TEASE HIM WITH AN OBTRUSIVE RAY
CHAPTER XXIX
MONSIEUR'S FTE
I WAS UP THE NEXT MORNING AN HOUR BEFORE DAYBREAK AND FINISHED MY
GUARD KNEELING ON THE DORMITORY FLOOR BESIDE THE CENTRE STAND FOR THE
BENEFIT OF SUCH EXPIRING GLIMMER AS THE NIGHT LAMP AFFORDED IN ITS LAST
WATCH
ALL MY MATERIALS MY WHOLE STOCK OF BEADS AND SILK WERE USED UP BEFORE
THE CHAIN ASSUMED THE LENGTH AND RICHNESS I WISHED I HAD WROUGHT IT
DOUBLE AS I KNEW BY THE RULE OF CONTRARIES THAT TO SUIT THE
PARTICULAR TASTE WHOSE GRATIFICATION WAS IN VIEW AN EFFECTIVE
APPEARANCE WAS QUITE INDISPENSABLE
AS A FINISH TO THE ORNAMENT A
LITTLE GOLD CLASP WAS NEEDED FORTUNATELY I POSSESSED IT IN THE
FASTENING OF MY SOLE NECKLACE I DULY DETACHED AND RE ATTACHED IT THEN
COILED COMPACTLY THE COMPLETED GUARD AND ENCLOSED IT IN A SMALL BOX I
HAD BOUGHT FOR ITS BRILLIANCY MADE OF SOME TROPIC SHELL OF THE COLOUR
CALLED NACARAT AND DECKED WITH A LITTLE CORONAL OF SPARKLING BLUE
STONES
WITHIN THE LID OF THE BOX I CAREFULLY GRAVED WITH MY SCISSORS'
POINT CERTAIN INITIALS
THE READER WILL PERHAPS REMEMBER THE DESCRIPTION OF MADAME BECK'S
FTE NOR WILL HE HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT AT EACH ANNIVERSARY A HANDSOME
PRESENT WAS SUBSCRIBED FOR AND OFFERED BY THE SCHOOL
THE OBSERVANCE OF
THIS DAY WAS A DISTINCTION ACCORDED TO NONE BUT MADAME AND IN A
MODIFIED FORM TO HER KINSMAN AND COUNSELLOR M
EMANUEL
IN THE LATTER
CASE IT WAS AN HONOUR SPONTANEOUSLY AWARDED NOT PLOTTED AND CONTRIVED
BEFOREHAND AND OFFERED AN ADDITIONAL PROOF AMONGST MANY OTHERS OF
THE ESTIMATION IN WHICH DESPITE HIS PARTIALITIES PREJUDICES AND
IRRITABILITIES THE PROFESSOR OF LITERATURE WAS HELD BY HIS PUPILS
NO
ARTICLE OF VALUE WAS OFFERED TO HIM HE DISTINCTLY GAVE IT TO BE
UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT NEITHER PLATE NOR JEWELLERY
YET HE
LIKED A SLIGHT TRIBUTE THE COST THE MONEY VALUE DID NOT TOUCH HIM A
DIAMOND RING A GOLD SNUFF BOX PRESENTED WITH POMP WOULD HAVE
PLEASED HIM LESS THAN A FLOWER OR A DRAWING OFFERED SIMPLY AND WITH
SINCERE FEELINGS
SUCH WAS HIS NATURE
HE WAS A MAN NOT WISE IN HIS
GENERATION YET COULD HE CLAIM A FILIAL SYMPATHY WITH THE DAYSPRING ON
HIGH
M
PAUL'S FTE FELL ON THE FIRST OF MARCH AND A THURSDAY
IT PROVED A
FINE SUNNY DAY AND BEING LIKEWISE THE MORNING ON WHICH IT WAS
CUSTOMARY TO ATTEND MASS BEING ALSO OTHERWISE DISTINGUISHED BY THE
HALF HOLIDAY WHICH PERMITTED THE PRIVILEGE OF WALKING OUT SHOPPING OR
PAYING VISITS IN THE AFTERNOON THESE COMBINED CONSIDERATIONS INDUCED A
GENERAL SMARTNESS AND FRESHNESS OF DRESS
CLEAN COLLARS WERE IN VOGUE
THE ORDINARY DINGY WOOLLEN CLASSE DRESS WAS EXCHANGED FOR SOMETHING
LIGHTER AND CLEARER
MADEMOISELLE ZLIE ST
PIERRE ON THIS PARTICULAR
THURSDAY EVEN ASSUMED A ROBE DE SOIE DEEMED IN ECONOMICAL
LABASSECOUR AN ARTICLE OF HAZARDOUS SPLENDOUR AND LUXURY NAY IT WAS
REMARKED THAT SHE SENT FOR A COIFFEUR TO DRESS HER HAIR THAT MORNING
THERE WERE PUPILS ACUTE ENOUGH TO DISCOVER THAT SHE HAD BEDEWED HER
HANDKERCHIEF AND HER HANDS WITH A NEW AND FASHIONABLE PERFUME
POOR
ZLIE IT WAS MUCH HER WONT TO DECLARE ABOUT THIS TIME THAT SHE WAS
TIRED TO DEATH OF A LIFE OF SECLUSION AND LABOUR THAT SHE LONGED TO
HAVE THE MEANS AND LEISURE FOR RELAXATION TO HAVE SOME ONE TO WORK FOR
HER A HUSBAND WHO WOULD PAY HER DEBTS SHE WAS WOEFULLY ENCUMBERED
WITH DEBT SUPPLY HER WARDROBE AND LEAVE HER AT LIBERTY AS SHE SAID
TO GOTER UN PEU LES PLAISIRS IT HAD LONG BEEN RUMOURED THAT HER
EYE WAS UPON M
EMANUEL
MONSIEUR EMANUEL'S EYE WAS CERTAINLY OFTEN
UPON HER
HE WOULD SIT AND WATCH HER PERSEVERINGLY FOR MINUTES
TOGETHER
I HAVE SEEN HIM GIVE HER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S GAZE WHILE
THE CLASS WAS SILENTLY COMPOSING AND HE SAT THRONED ON HIS ESTRADE
UNOCCUPIED
CONSCIOUS ALWAYS OF THIS BASILISK ATTENTION SHE WOULD
WRITHE UNDER IT HALF FLATTERED HALF PUZZLED AND MONSIEUR WOULD
FOLLOW HER SENSATIONS SOMETIMES LOOKING APPALLINGLY ACUTE FOR IN SOME
CASES HE HAD THE TERRIBLE UNERRING PENETRATION OF INSTINCT AND
PIERCED IN ITS HIDING PLACE THE LAST LURKING THOUGHT OF THE HEART AND
DISCERNED UNDER FLORID VEILINGS THE BARE BARREN PLACES OF THE SPIRIT
YES AND ITS PERVERTED TENDENCIES AND ITS HIDDEN FALSE CURVES ALL
THAT MEN AND WOMEN WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THE TWISTED SPINE THE
MALFORMED LIMB THAT WAS BORN WITH THEM AND FAR WORSE THE STAIN OR
DISFIGUREMENT THEY HAVE PERHAPS BROUGHT ON THEMSELVES
NO CALAMITY SO
ACCURSED BUT M
EMANUEL COULD PITY AND FORGIVE IF IT WERE ACKNOWLEDGED
CANDIDLY BUT WHERE HIS QUESTIONING EYES MET DISHONEST DENIAL WHERE
HIS RUTHLESS RESEARCHES FOUND DECEITFUL CONCEALMENT OH THEN HE COULD
BE CRUEL AND I THOUGHT WICKED HE WOULD EXULTANTLY SNATCH THE SCREEN
FROM POOR SHRINKING WRETCHES PASSIONATELY HURRY THEM TO THE SUMMIT OF
THE MOUNT OF EXPOSURE AND THERE SHOW THEM ALL NAKED ALL FALSE POOR
LIVING LIES THE SPAWN OF THAT HORRID TRUTH WHICH CANNOT BE LOOKED ON
UNVEILED
HE THOUGHT HE DID JUSTICE FOR MY PART I DOUBT WHETHER MAN
HAS A RIGHT TO DO SUCH JUSTICE ON MAN MORE THAN ONCE IN THESE HIS
VISITATIONS I HAVE FELT COMPELLED TO GIVE TEARS TO HIS VICTIMS AND
NOT SPARED IRE AND KEEN REPROACH TO HIMSELF
HE DESERVED IT BUT IT WAS
DIFFICULT TO SHAKE HIM IN HIS FIRM CONVICTION THAT THE WORK WAS
RIGHTEOUS AND NEEDED
BREAKFAST BEING OVER AND MASS ATTENDED THE SCHOOL BELL RANG AND THE
ROOMS FILLED A VERY PRETTY SPECTACLE WAS PRESENTED IN CLASSE
PUPILS
AND TEACHERS SAT NEATLY ARRAYED ORDERLY AND EXPECTANT EACH BEARING IN
HER HAND THE BOUQUET OF FELICITATION THE PRETTIEST SPRING FLOWERS ALL
FRESH AND FILLING THE AIR WITH THEIR FRAGRANCE I ONLY HAD NO BOUQUET
I LIKE TO SEE FLOWERS GROWING BUT WHEN THEY ARE GATHERED THEY CEASE
TO PLEASE
I LOOK ON THEM AS THINGS ROOTLESS AND PERISHABLE THEIR
LIKENESS TO LIFE MAKES ME SAD
I NEVER OFFER FLOWERS TO THOSE I LOVE I
NEVER WISH TO RECEIVE THEM FROM HANDS DEAR TO ME
MADEMOISELLE ST
PIERRE MARKED MY EMPTY HANDS SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE I HAD BEEN SO
REMISS WITH AVIDITY HER EYE ROVED OVER AND ROUND ME SURELY I MUST
HAVE SOME SOLITARY SYMBOLIC FLOWER SOMEWHERE SOME SMALL KNOT OF
VIOLETS SOMETHING TO WIN MYSELF PRAISE FOR TASTE COMMENDATION FOR
INGENUITY
THE UNIMAGINATIVE ANGLAISE PROVED BETTER THAN THE
PARISIENNE'S FEARS SHE SAT LITERALLY UNPROVIDED AS BARE OF BLOOM OR
LEAF AS THE WINTER TREE
THIS ASCERTAINED ZLIE SMILED WELL PLEASED
HOW WISELY YOU HAVE ACTED TO KEEP YOUR MONEY MISS LUCIE SHE SAID
SILLY I HAVE GONE AND THROWN AWAY TWO FRANCS ON A BOUQUET OF HOT HOUSE
FLOWERS
AND SHE SHOWED WITH PRIDE HER SPLENDID NOSEGAY
BUT HUSH A STEP THE STEP
IT CAME PROMPT AS USUAL BUT WITH A
PROMPTITUDE WE FELT DISPOSED TO FLATTER OURSELVES INSPIRED BY OTHER
FEELINGS THAN MERE EXCITABILITY OF NERVE AND VEHEMENCE OF INTENT
WE
THOUGHT OUR PROFESSOR'S FOOT FALL TO SPEAK ROMANTICALLY HAD IN IT A
FRIENDLY PROMISE THIS MORNING AND SO IT HAD
HE ENTERED IN A MOOD WHICH MADE HIM AS GOOD AS A NEW SUNBEAM TO THE
ALREADY WELL LIT FIRST CLASSE
THE MORNING LIGHT PLAYING AMONGST OUR
PLANTS AND LAUGHING ON OUR WALLS CAUGHT AN ADDED LUSTRE FROM M
PAUL'S
ALL BENIGNANT SALUTE
LIKE A TRUE FRENCHMAN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHY I
SHOULD SAY SO FOR HE WAS OF STRAIN NEITHER FRENCH NOR LABASSECOURIEN
HE HAD DRESSED FOR THE SITUATION AND THE OCCASION
NOT BY THE VAGUE
FOLDS SINISTER AND CONSPIRATOR LIKE OF HIS SOOT DARK PALETT WERE THE
OUTLINES OF HIS PERSON OBSCURED ON THE CONTRARY HIS FIGURE SUCH AS
IT WAS I DON'T BOAST OF IT WAS WELL SET OFF BY A CIVILIZED COAT AND A
SILKEN VEST QUITE PRETTY TO BEHOLD
THE DEFIANT AND PAGAN BONNET GREC
HAD VANISHED BARE HEADED HE CAME UPON US CARRYING A CHRISTIAN HAT IN
HIS GLOVED HAND
THE LITTLE MAN LOOKED WELL VERY WELL THERE WAS A
CLEARNESS OF AMITY IN HIS BLUE EYE AND A GLOW OF GOOD FEELING ON HIS
DARK COMPLEXION WHICH PASSED PERFECTLY IN THE PLACE OF BEAUTY ONE
REALLY DID NOT CARE TO OBSERVE THAT HIS NOSE THOUGH FAR FROM SMALL
WAS OF NO PARTICULAR SHAPE HIS CHEEK THIN HIS BROW MARKED AND SQUARE
HIS MOUTH NO ROSE BUD ONE ACCEPTED HIM AS HE WAS AND FELT HIS
PRESENCE THE REVERSE OF DAMPING OR INSIGNIFICANT
HE PASSED TO HIS DESK HE PLACED ON THE SAME HIS HAT AND GLOVES
BON
JOUR MES AMIES SAID HE IN A TONE THAT SOMEHOW MADE AMENDS TO SOME
AMONGST US FOR MANY A SHARP SNAP AND SAVAGE SNARL NOT A JOCUND
GOOD FELLOW TONE STILL LESS AN UNCTUOUS PRIESTLY ACCENT BUT A VOICE
HE HAD BELONGING TO HIMSELF A VOICE USED WHEN HIS HEART PASSED THE
WORDS TO HIS LIPS
THAT SAME HEART DID SPEAK SOMETIMES THOUGH AN
IRRITABLE IT WAS NOT AN OSSIFIED ORGAN IN ITS CORE WAS A PLACE
TENDER BEYOND A MAN'S TENDERNESS A PLACE THAT HUMBLED HIM TO LITTLE
CHILDREN THAT BOUND HIM TO GIRLS AND WOMEN TO WHOM REBEL AS HE WOULD
HE COULD NOT DISOWN HIS AFFINITY NOR QUITE DENY THAT ON THE WHOLE HE
WAS BETTER WITH THEM THAN WITH HIS OWN SEX
WE ALL WISH MONSIEUR A GOOD DAY AND PRESENT TO HIM OUR
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS FTE SAID MADEMOISELLE
ZLIE CONSTITUTING HERSELF SPOKESWOMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY AND ADVANCING
WITH NO MORE TWISTS OF AFFECTATION THAN WERE WITH HER INDISPENSABLE TO
THE ACHIEVEMENT OF MOTION SHE LAID HER COSTLY BOUQUET BEFORE HIM
HE
BOWED OVER IT
THE LONG TRAIN OF OFFERINGS FOLLOWED ALL THE PUPILS SWEEPING PAST
WITH THE GLIDING STEP FOREIGNERS PRACTISE LEFT THEIR TRIBUTES AS THEY
WENT BY
EACH GIRL SO DEXTEROUSLY ADJUSTED HER SEPARATE GIFT THAT WHEN
THE LAST BOUQUET WAS LAID ON THE DESK IT FORMED THE APEX TO A BLOOMING
PYRAMID A PYRAMID BLOOMING SPREADING AND TOWERING WITH SUCH
EXUBERANCE AS IN THE END TO ECLIPSE THE HERO BEHIND IT
THIS CEREMONY
OVER SEATS WERE RESUMED AND WE SAT IN DEAD SILENCE EXPECTANT OF A
SPEECH
I SUPPOSE FIVE MINUTES MIGHT HAVE ELAPSED AND THE HUSH REMAINED
UNBROKEN TEN AND THERE WAS NO SOUND
MANY PRESENT BEGAN DOUBTLESS TO WONDER FOR WHAT MONSIEUR WAITED AS
WELL THEY MIGHT
VOICELESS AND VIEWLESS STIRLESS AND WORDLESS HE KEPT
HIS STATION BEHIND THE PILE OF FLOWERS
AT LAST THERE ISSUED FORTH A VOICE RATHER DEEP AS IF IT SPOKE OUT OF
A HOLLOW
EST CE L TOUT
MADEMOISELLE ZLIE LOOKED ROUND
YOU HAVE ALL PRESENTED YOUR BOUQUETS INQUIRED SHE OF THE PUPILS
YES THEY HAD ALL GIVEN THEIR NOSEGAYS FROM THE ELDEST TO THE
YOUNGEST FROM THE TALLEST TO THE MOST DIMINUTIVE
THE SENIOR MISTRESS
SIGNIFIED AS MUCH
EST CE L TOUT WAS REITERATED IN AN INTONATION WHICH DEEP BEFORE
HAD NOW DESCENDED SOME NOTES LOWER
MONSIEUR SAID MADEMOISELLE ST
PIERRE RISING AND THIS TIME
SPEAKING WITH HER OWN SWEET SMILE I HAVE THE HONOUR TO TELL YOU THAT
WITH A SINGLE EXCEPTION EVERY PERSON IN CLASSE HAS OFFERED HER
BOUQUET
FOR MEESS LUCIE MONSIEUR WILL KINDLY MAKE ALLOWANCE AS A
FOREIGNER SHE PROBABLY DID NOT KNOW OUR CUSTOMS OR DID NOT APPRECIATE
THEIR SIGNIFICANCE
MEESS LUCIE HAS REGARDED THIS CEREMONY AS TOO
FRIVOLOUS TO BE HONOURED BY HER OBSERVANCE
FAMOUS I MUTTERED BETWEEN MY TEETH YOU ARE NO BAD SPEAKER ZLIE
WHEN YOU BEGIN
THE ANSWER VOUCHSAFED TO MADEMOISELLE ST PIERRE FROM THE ESTRADE WAS
GIVEN IN THE GESTICULATION OF A HAND FROM BEHIND THE PYRAMID
THIS
MANUAL ACTION SEEMED TO DEPRECATE WORDS TO ENJOIN SILENCE
A FORM ERE LONG FOLLOWED THE HAND
MONSIEUR EMERGED FROM HIS ECLIPSE
AND PRODUCING HIMSELF ON THE FRONT OF HIS ESTRADE AND GAZING STRAIGHT
AND FIXEDLY BEFORE HIM AT A VAST MAPPE MONDE COVERING THE WALL
OPPOSITE HE DEMANDED A THIRD TIME AND NOW IN REALLY TRAGIC TONES
EST CE L TOUT
I MIGHT YET HAVE MADE ALL RIGHT BY STEPPING FORWARDS AND SLIPPING INTO
HIS HAND THE RUDDY LITTLE SHELL BOX I AT THAT MOMENT HELD TIGHT IN MY
OWN
IT WAS WHAT I HAD FULLY PURPOSED TO DO BUT FIRST THE COMIC SIDE
OF MONSIEUR'S BEHAVIOUR HAD TEMPTED ME TO DELAY AND NOW MADEMOISELLE
ST
PIERRE'S AFFECTED INTERFERENCE PROVOKED CONTUMACITY
THE READER NOT
HAVING HITHERTO HAD ANY CAUSE TO ASCRIBE TO MISS SNOWE'S CHARACTER THE
MOST DISTANT PRETENSIONS TO PERFECTION WILL BE SCARCELY SURPRISED TO
LEARN THAT SHE FELT TOO PERVERSE TO DEFEND HERSELF FROM ANY IMPUTATION
THE PARISIENNE MIGHT CHOOSE TO INSINUATE AND BESIDES M
PAUL WAS SO
TRAGIC AND TOOK MY DEFECTION SO SERIOUSLY HE DESERVED TO BE VEXED
I
KEPT THEN BOTH MY BOX AND MY COUNTENANCE AND SAT INSENSATE AS ANY
STONE
IT IS WELL DROPPED AT LENGTH FROM THE LIPS OF M
PAUL AND HAVING
UTTERED THIS PHRASE THE SHADOW OF SOME GREAT PAROXYSM THE SWELL OF
WRATH SCORN RESOLVE PASSED OVER HIS BROW RIPPLED HIS LIPS AND
LINED HIS CHEEKS
GULPING DOWN ALL FURTHER COMMENT HE LAUNCHED INTO
HIS CUSTOMARY DISCOURS
I CAN'T AT ALL REMEMBER WHAT THIS DISCOURS WAS I DID NOT LISTEN TO
IT THE GULPING DOWN PROCESS THE ABRUPT DISMISSAL OF HIS MORTIFICATION
OR VEXATION HAD GIVEN ME A SENSATION WHICH HALF COUNTERACTED THE
LUDICROUS EFFECT OF THE REITERATED EST CE L TOUT
TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE SPEECH THERE CAME A PLEASING DIVERSION MY
ATTENTION WAS AGAIN AMUSINGLY ARRESTED
OWING TO SOME LITTLE ACCIDENTAL MOVEMENT I THINK I DROPPED MY THIMBLE
ON THE FLOOR AND IN STOOPING TO REGAIN IT HIT THE CROWN OF MY HEAD
AGAINST THE SHARP CORNER OF MY DESK WHICH CASUALTIES EXASPERATING TO
ME BY RIGHTS IF TO ANYBODY NATURALLY MADE A SLIGHT BUSTLE M
PAUL
BECAME IRRITATED AND DISMISSING HIS FORCED EQUANIMITY AND CASTING TO
THE WINDS THAT DIGNITY AND SELF CONTROL WITH WHICH HE NEVER CARED LONG
TO ENCUMBER HIMSELF HE BROKE FORTH INTO THE STRAIN BEST CALCULATED TO
GIVE HIM EASE
I DON'T KNOW HOW IN THE PROGRESS OF HIS DISCOURS HE HAD CONTRIVED
TO CROSS THE CHANNEL AND LAND ON BRITISH GROUND BUT THERE I FOUND HIM
WHEN I BEGAN TO LISTEN
CASTING A QUICK CYNICAL GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM A GLANCE WHICH SCATHED
OR WAS INTENDED TO SCATHE AS IT CROSSED ME HE FELL WITH FURY UPON
LES ANGLAISES
NEVER HAVE I HEARD ENGLISH WOMEN HANDLED AS M
PAUL THAT MORNING
HANDLED THEM HE SPARED NOTHING NEITHER THEIR MINDS MORALS MANNERS
NOR PERSONAL APPEARANCE
I SPECIALLY REMEMBER HIS ABUSE OF THEIR TALL
STATURE THEIR LONG NECKS THEIR THIN ARMS THEIR SLOVENLY DRESS THEIR
PEDANTIC EDUCATION THEIR IMPIOUS SCEPTICISM THEIR INSUFFERABLE
PRIDE THEIR PRETENTIOUS VIRTUE OVER WHICH HE GROUND HIS TEETH
MALIGNANTLY AND LOOKED AS IF HAD HE DARED HE WOULD HAVE SAID
SINGULAR THINGS
OH HE WAS SPITEFUL ACRID SAVAGE AND AS A NATURAL
CONSEQUENCE DETESTABLY UGLY
LITTLE WICKED VENOMOUS MAN THOUGHT I AM I GOING TO HARASS MYSELF
WITH FEARS OF DISPLEASING YOU OR HURTING YOUR FEELINGS NO INDEED
YOU SHALL BE INDIFFERENT TO ME AS THE SHABBIEST BOUQUET IN YOUR
PYRAMID
I GRIEVE TO SAY I COULD NOT QUITE CARRY OUT THIS RESOLUTION
FOR SOME
TIME THE ABUSE OF ENGLAND AND THE ENGLISH FOUND AND LEFT ME STOLID I
BORE IT SOME FIFTEEN MINUTES STOICALLY ENOUGH BUT THIS HISSING
COCKATRICE WAS DETERMINED TO STING AND HE SAID SUCH THINGS AT
LAST FASTENING NOT ONLY UPON OUR WOMEN BUT UPON OUR GREATEST NAMES
AND BEST MEN SULLYING THE SHIELD OF BRITANNIA AND DABBLING THE UNION
JACK IN MUD THAT I WAS STUNG
WITH VICIOUS RELISH HE BROUGHT UP THE
MOST SPICY CURRENT CONTINENTAL HISTORICAL FALSEHOODS THAN WHICH
NOTHING CAN BE CONCEIVED MORE OFFENSIVE
ZLIE AND THE WHOLE CLASS
BECAME ONE GRIN OF VINDICTIVE DELIGHT FOR IT IS CURIOUS TO DISCOVER
HOW THESE CLOWNS OF LABASSECOUR SECRETLY HATE ENGLAND
AT LAST I
STRUCK A SHARP STROKE ON MY DESK OPENED MY LIPS AND LET LOOSE THIS
CRY
VIVE L'ANGLETERRE L'HISTOIRE ET LES HROS A BAS LA FRANCE LA
FICTION ET LES FAQUINS
THE CLASS WAS STRUCK OF A HEAP
I SUPPOSE THEY THOUGHT ME MAD
THE
PROFESSOR PUT UP HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND FIENDISHLY SMILED INTO ITS
FOLDS
LITTLE MONSTER OF MALICE HE NOW THOUGHT HE HAD GOT THE VICTORY
SINCE HE HAD MADE ME ANGRY
IN A SECOND HE BECAME GOOD HUMOURED
WITH
GREAT BLANDNESS HE RESUMED THE SUBJECT OF HIS FLOWERS TALKED
POETICALLY AND SYMBOLICALLY OF THEIR SWEETNESS PERFUME PURITY
ETCETERA MADE FRENCHIFIED COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE JEUNES FILLES AND
THE SWEET BLOSSOMS BEFORE HIM PAID MADEMOISELLE ST
PIERRE A VERY
FULL BLOWN COMPLIMENT ON THE SUPERIORITY OF HER BOUQUET AND ENDED BY
ANNOUNCING THAT THE FIRST REALLY FINE MILD AND BALMY MORNING IN
SPRING HE INTENDED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CLASS OUT TO BREAKFAST IN THE
COUNTRY
SUCH OF THE CLASS AT LEAST HE ADDED WITH EMPHASIS AS HE
COULD COUNT AMONGST THE NUMBER OF HIS FRIENDS
DONC JE N'Y SERAI PAS DECLARED I INVOLUNTARILY
SOIT WAS HIS RESPONSE AND GATHERING HIS FLOWERS IN HIS ARMS HE
FLASHED OUT OF CLASSE WHILE I CONSIGNING MY WORK SCISSORS THIMBLE
AND THE NEGLECTED LITTLE BOX TO MY DESK SWEPT UP STAIRS
I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER HE FELT HOT AND ANGRY BUT I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT I DID
YET WITH A STRANGE EVANESCENT ANGER I HAD NOT SAT AN HOUR ON THE EDGE
OF MY BED PICTURING AND REPICTURING HIS LOOK MANNER WORDS ERE I
SMILED AT THE WHOLE SCENE
A LITTLE PANG OF REGRET I UNDERWENT THAT THE
BOX HAD NOT BEEN OFFERED
I HAD MEANT TO GRATIFY HIM
FATE WOULD NOT
HAVE IT SO
IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON REMEMBERING THAT DESKS IN CLASSE WERE
BY NO MEANS INVIOLATE REPOSITORIES AND THINKING THAT IT WAS AS WELL TO
SECURE THE BOX ON ACCOUNT OF THE INITIALS IN THE LID P
C
D
E FOR
PAUL CARL OR CARLOS DAVID EMANUEL SUCH WAS HIS FULL NAME THESE
FOREIGNERS MUST ALWAYS HAVE A STRING OF BAPTISMALS I DESCENDED TO THE
SCHOOLROOM
IT SLEPT IN HOLIDAY REPOSE
THE DAY PUPILS WERE ALL GONE HOME THE
BOARDERS WERE OUT WALKING THE TEACHERS EXCEPT THE SURVEILLANTE OF THE
WEEK WERE IN TOWN VISITING OR SHOPPING THE SUITE OF DIVISIONS WAS
VACANT SO WAS THE GRANDE SALLE WITH ITS HUGE SOLEMN GLOBE HANGING IN
THE MIDST ITS PAIR OF MANY BRANCHED CHANDELIERS AND ITS HORIZONTAL
GRAND PIANO CLOSED SILENT ENJOYING ITS MID WEEK SABBATH
I RATHER
WONDERED TO FIND THE FIRST CLASSE DOOR AJAR THIS ROOM BEING USUALLY
LOCKED WHEN EMPTY AND BEING THEN INACCESSIBLE TO ANY SAVE MADAME BECK
AND MYSELF WHO POSSESSED A DUPLICATE KEY
I WONDERED STILL MORE ON
APPROACHING TO HEAR A VAGUE MOVEMENT AS OF LIFE A STEP A CHAIR
STIRRED A SOUND LIKE THE OPENING OF A DESK
IT IS ONLY MADAME BECK DOING INSPECTION DUTY WAS THE CONCLUSION
FOLLOWING A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
THE PARTIALLY OPENED DOOR GAVE
OPPORTUNITY FOR ASSURANCE ON THIS POINT
I LOOKED
BEHOLD NOT THE
INSPECTING GARB OF MADAME BECK THE SHAWL AND THE CLEAN CAP BUT THE
COAT AND THE CLOSE SHORN DARK HEAD OF A MAN
THIS PERSON OCCUPIED MY
CHAIR HIS OLIVE HAND HELD MY DESK OPEN HIS NOSE WAS LOST TO VIEW
AMONGST MY PAPERS
HIS BACK WAS TOWARDS ME BUT THERE COULD NOT BE A
MOMENT'S QUESTION ABOUT IDENTITY
ALREADY WAS THE ATTIRE OF CEREMONY
DISCARDED THE CHERISHED AND INK STAINED PALETT WAS RESUMED THE
PERVERSE BONNET GREC LAY ON THE FLOOR AS IF JUST DROPPED FROM THE
HAND CULPABLY BUSY
NOW I KNEW AND I HAD LONG KNOWN THAT THAT HAND OF M
EMANUEL'S WAS ON
THE MOST INTIMATE TERMS WITH MY DESK THAT IT RAISED AND LOWERED THE
LID RANSACKED AND ARRANGED THE CONTENTS ALMOST AS FAMILIARLY AS MY
OWN
THE FACT WAS NOT DUBIOUS NOR DID HE WISH IT TO BE SO HE LEFT
SIGNS OF EACH VISIT PALPABLE AND UNMISTAKABLE HITHERTO HOWEVER I HAD
NEVER CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT WATCH AS I WOULD I COULD NOT DETECT THE
HOURS AND MOMENTS OF HIS COMING
I SAW THE BROWNIE'S WORK IN EXERCISES
LEFT OVERNIGHT FULL OF FAULTS AND FOUND NEXT MORNING CAREFULLY
CORRECTED I PROFITED BY HIS CAPRICIOUS GOOD WILL IN LOANS FULL WELCOME
AND REFRESHING
BETWEEN A SALLOW DICTIONARY AND WORN OUT GRAMMAR WOULD
MAGICALLY GROW A FRESH INTERESTING NEW WORK OR A CLASSIC MELLOW AND
SWEET IN ITS RIPE AGE
OUT OF MY WORK BASKET WOULD LAUGHINGLY PEEP A
ROMANCE UNDER IT WOULD LURK THE PAMPHLET THE MAGAZINE WHENCE LAST
EVENING'S READING HAD BEEN EXTRACTED
IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT THE SOURCE
WHENCE THESE TREASURES FLOWED HAD THERE BEEN NO OTHER INDICATION ONE
CONDEMNING AND TRAITOR PECULIARITY COMMON TO THEM ALL SETTLED THE
QUESTION THEY SMELT OF CIGARS
THIS WAS VERY SHOCKING OF COURSE
I THOUGHT SO AT FIRST AND USED TO OPEN THE WINDOW WITH SOME BUSTLE
TO AIR MY DESK AND WITH FASTIDIOUS FINGER AND THUMB TO HOLD THE
PECCANT BROCHURES FORTH TO THE PURIFYING BREEZE
I WAS CURED OF THAT
FORMALITY SUDDENLY
MONSIEUR CAUGHT ME AT IT ONE DAY UNDERSTOOD THE
INFERENCE INSTANTLY RELIEVED MY HAND OF ITS BURDEN AND IN ANOTHER
MOMENT WOULD HAVE THRUST THE SAME INTO THE GLOWING STOVE
IT CHANCED
TO BE A BOOK ON THE PERUSAL OF WHICH I WAS BENT SO FOR ONCE I PROVED
AS DECIDED AND QUICKER THAN HIMSELF RECAPTURED THE SPOIL AND HAVING
SAVED THIS VOLUME NEVER HAZARDED A SECOND
WITH ALL THIS I HAD NEVER
YET BEEN ABLE TO ARREST IN HIS VISITS THE FREAKISH FRIENDLY
CIGAR LOVING PHANTOM
BUT NOW AT LAST I HAD HIM THERE HE WAS THE VERY BROWNIE HIMSELF AND
THERE CURLING FROM HIS LIPS WAS THE PALE BLUE BREATH OF HIS INDIAN
DARLING HE WAS SMOKING INTO MY DESK IT MIGHT WELL BETRAY HIM
PROVOKED AT THIS PARTICULAR AND YET PLEASED TO SURPRISE HIM PLEASED
THAT IS WITH THE MIXED FEELING OF THE HOUSEWIFE WHO DISCOVERS AT LAST
HER STRANGE ELFIN ALLY BUSY IN THE DAIRY AT THE UNTIMELY CHURN I
SOFTLY STOLE FORWARD STOOD BEHIND HIM BENT WITH PRECAUTION OVER HIS
SHOULDER
MY HEART SMOTE ME TO SEE THAT AFTER THIS MORNING'S HOSTILITY AFTER MY
SEEMING REMISSNESS AFTER THE PUNCTURE EXPERIENCED BY HIS FEELINGS AND
THE RUFFLING UNDERGONE BY HIS TEMPER HE ALL WILLING TO FORGET AND
FORGIVE HAD BROUGHT ME A COUPLE OF HANDSOME VOLUMES OF WHICH THE
TITLE AND AUTHORSHIP WERE GUARANTEES FOR INTEREST
NOW AS HE SAT
BENDING ABOVE THE DESK HE WAS STIRRING UP ITS CONTENTS BUT WITH
GENTLE AND CAREFUL HAND DISARRANGING INDEED BUT NOT HARMING
MY HEART
SMOTE ME AS I BENT OVER HIM AS HE SAT UNCONSCIOUS DOING ME WHAT GOOD
HE COULD AND I DARESAY NOT FEELING TOWARDS ME UNKINDLY MY MORNING'S
ANGER QUITE MELTED I DID NOT DISLIKE PROFESSOR EMANUEL
I THINK HE HEARD ME BREATHE
HE TURNED SUDDENLY HIS TEMPERAMENT WAS
NERVOUS YET HE NEVER STARTED AND SELDOM CHANGED COLOUR THERE WAS
SOMETHING HARDY ABOUT HIM
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE INTO TOWN WITH THE OTHER TEACHERS SAID HE
TAKING A GRIM GRIPE OF HIS SELF POSSESSION WHICH HALF ESCAPED HIM IT
IS AS WELL YOU ARE NOT
DO YOU THINK I CARE FOR BEING CAUGHT NOT I
I
OFTEN VISIT YOUR DESK
MONSIEUR I KNOW IT
YOU FIND A BROCHURE OR TOME NOW AND THEN BUT YOU DON'T READ THEM
BECAUSE THEY HAVE PASSED UNDER THIS TOUCHING HIS CIGAR
THEY HAVE AND ARE NO BETTER FOR THE PROCESS BUT I READ THEM
WITHOUT PLEASURE
MONSIEUR MUST NOT BE CONTRADICTED
DO YOU LIKE THEM OR ANY OF THEM ARE THEY ACCEPTABLE MONSIEUR HAS
SEEN ME READING THEM A HUNDRED TIMES AND KNOWS I HAVE NOT SO MANY
RECREATIONS AS TO UNDERVALUE THOSE HE PROVIDES
I MEAN WELL AND IF YOU SEE THAT I MEAN WELL AND DERIVE SOME LITTLE
AMUSEMENT FROM MY EFFORTS WHY CAN WE NOT BE FRIENDS
A FATALIST WOULD SAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT
THIS MORNING HE CONTINUED I AWOKE IN A BRIGHT MOOD AND CAME INTO
CLASSE HAPPY YOU SPOILED MY DAY
NO MONSIEUR ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO OF IT AND THAT UNINTENTIONALLY
UNINTENTIONALLY NO
IT WAS MY FTE DAY EVERYBODY WISHED ME HAPPINESS
BUT YOU
THE LITTLE CHILDREN OF THE THIRD DIVISION GAVE EACH HER KNOT
OF VIOLETS LISPED EACH HER CONGRATULATION YOU NOTHING
NOT A BUD
LEAF WHISPER NOT A GLANCE
WAS THIS UNINTENTIONAL
I MEANT NO HARM
THEN YOU REALLY DID NOT KNOW OUR CUSTOM YOU WERE UNPREPARED YOU
WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE LAID OUT A FEW CENTIMES ON A FLOWER TO GIVE ME
PLEASURE HAD YOU BEEN AWARE THAT IT WAS EXPECTED SAY SO AND ALL IS
FORGOTTEN AND THE PAIN SOOTHED
I DID KNOW THAT IT WAS EXPECTED I WAS PREPARED YET I LAID OUT NO
CENTIMES ON FLOWERS
IT IS WELL YOU DO RIGHT TO BE HONEST
I SHOULD ALMOST HAVE HATED YOU
HAD YOU FLATTERED AND LIED
BETTER DECLARE AT ONCE 'PAUL CARL
EMANUEL JE TE DTESTE MON GARON THAN SMILE AN INTEREST LOOK AN
AFFECTION AND BE FALSE AND COLD AT HEART
FALSE AND COLD I DON'T THINK
YOU ARE BUT YOU HAVE MADE A GREAT MISTAKE IN LIFE THAT I BELIEVE I
THINK YOUR JUDGMENT IS WARPED THAT YOU ARE INDIFFERENT WHERE YOU OUGHT
TO BE GRATEFUL AND PERHAPS DEVOTED AND INFATUATED WHERE YOU OUGHT TO
BE COOL AS YOUR NAME
DON'T SUPPOSE THAT I WISH YOU TO HAVE A PASSION
FOR ME MADEMOISELLE DIEU VOUS EN GARDE WHAT DO YOU START FOR
BECAUSE I SAID PASSION WELL I SAY IT AGAIN
THERE IS SUCH A WORD AND
THERE IS SUCH A THING THOUGH NOT WITHIN THESE WALLS THANK HEAVEN YOU
ARE NO CHILD THAT ONE SHOULD NOT SPEAK OF WHAT EXISTS BUT I ONLY
UTTERED THE WORD THE THING I ASSURE YOU IS ALIEN TO MY WHOLE LIFE
AND VIEWS
IT DIED IN THE PAST IN THE PRESENT IT LIES BURIED ITS
GRAVE IS DEEP DUG WELL HEAPED AND MANY WINTERS OLD IN THE FUTURE
THERE WILL BE A RESURRECTION AS I BELIEVE TO MY SOULS CONSOLATION BUT
ALL WILL THEN BE CHANGED FORM AND FEELING THE MORTAL WILL HAVE PUT ON
IMMORTALITY IT WILL RISE NOT FOR EARTH BUT HEAVEN
ALL I SAY TO
YOU MISS LUCY SNOWE IS THAT YOU OUGHT TO TREAT PROFESSOR PAUL
EMANUEL DECENTLY
I COULD NOT AND DID NOT CONTRADICT SUCH A SENTIMENT
TELL ME HE PURSUED WHEN IT IS YOUR FTE DAY AND I WILL NOT
GRUDGE A FEW CENTIMES FOR A SMALL OFFERING
YOU WILL BE LIKE ME MONSIEUR THIS COST MORE THAN A FEW CENTIMES AND
I DID NOT GRUDGE ITS PRICE
AND TAKING FROM THE OPEN DESK THE LITTLE BOX I PUT IT INTO HIS HAND
IT LAY READY IN MY LAP THIS MORNING I CONTINUED AND IF MONSIEUR
HAD BEEN RATHER MORE PATIENT AND MADEMOISELLE ST
PIERRE LESS
INTERFERING PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY TOO IF I HAD BEEN CALMER AND
WISER I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT THEN
HE LOOKED AT THE BOX I SAW ITS CLEAR WARM TINT AND BRIGHT AZURE
CIRCLET PLEASED HIS EYES
I TOLD HIM TO OPEN IT
MY INITIALS SAID HE INDICATING THE LETTERS IN THE LID
WHO TOLD
YOU I WAS CALLED CARL DAVID
A LITTLE BIRD MONSIEUR
DOES IT FLY FROM ME TO YOU THEN ONE CAN TIE A MESSAGE UNDER ITS WING
WHEN NEEDFUL
HE TOOK OUT THE CHAIN A TRIFLE INDEED AS TO VALUE BUT GLOSSY WITH
SILK AND SPARKLING WITH BEADS
HE LIKED THAT TOO ADMIRED IT ARTLESSLY
LIKE A CHILD
FOR ME
YES FOR YOU
THIS IS THE THING YOU WERE WORKING AT LAST NIGHT
THE SAME
YOU FINISHED IT THIS MORNING
I DID
YOU COMMENCED IT WITH THE INTENTION THAT IT SHOULD BE MINE
UNDOUBTEDLY
AND OFFERED ON MY FTE DAY
YES
THIS PURPOSE CONTINUED AS YOU WOVE IT
AGAIN I ASSENTED
THEN IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD CUT OUT ANY PORTION SAYING
THIS PART IS NOT MINE IT WAS PLAITED UNDER THE IDEA AND FOR THE
ADORNMENT OF ANOTHER
BY NO MEANS
IT IS NEITHER NECESSARY NOR WOULD IT BE JUST
THIS OBJECT IS ALL MINE
THAT OBJECT IS YOURS ENTIRELY
STRAIGHTWAY MONSIEUR OPENED HIS PALETT ARRANGED THE GUARD SPLENDIDLY
ACROSS HIS CHEST DISPLAYING AS MUCH AND SUPPRESSING AS LITTLE AS HE
COULD FOR HE HAD NO NOTION OF CONCEALING WHAT HE ADMIRED AND THOUGHT
DECORATIVE
AS TO THE BOX HE PRONOUNCED IT A SUPERB BONBONNIRE HE
WAS FOND OF BONBONS BY THE WAY AND AS HE ALWAYS LIKED TO SHARE WITH
OTHERS WHAT PLEASED HIMSELF HE WOULD GIVE HIS DRAGES AS FREELY AS
HE LENT HIS BOOKS
AMONGST THE KIND BROWNIE'S GIFTS LEFT IN MY DESK I
FORGOT TO ENUMERATE MANY A PAPER OF CHOCOLATE COMFITS
HIS TASTES IN
THESE MATTERS WERE SOUTHERN AND WHAT WE THINK INFANTINE
HIS SIMPLE
LUNCH CONSISTED FREQUENTLY OF A BRIOCHE WHICH AS OFTEN AS NOT TO
SHARED WITH SOME CHILD OF THE THIRD DIVISION
A PRSENT C'EST UN FAIT ACCOMPLI SAID HE RE ADJUSTING HIS PALETT
AND WE HAD NO MORE WORDS ON THE SUBJECT
AFTER LOOKING OVER THE TWO
VOLUMES HE HAD BROUGHT AND CUTTING AWAY SOME PAGES WITH HIS PENKNIFE
HE GENERALLY PRUNED BEFORE LENDING HIS BOOKS ESPECIALLY IF THEY WERE
NOVELS AND SOMETIMES I WAS A LITTLE PROVOKED AT THE SEVERITY OF HIS
CENSORSHIP THE RETRENCHMENTS INTERRUPTING THE NARRATIVE HE ROSE
POLITELY TOUCHED HIS BONNET GREC AND BADE ME A CIVIL GOOD DAY
WE ARE FRIENDS NOW THOUGHT I TILL THE NEXT TIME WE QUARREL
WE MIGHT HAVE QUARRELLED AGAIN THAT VERY SAME EVENING BUT WONDERFUL
TO RELATE FAILED FOR ONCE TO MAKE THE MOST OF OUR OPPORTUNITY
CONTRARY TO ALL EXPECTATION M
PAUL ARRIVED AT THE STUDY HOUR
HAVING
SEEN SO MUCH OF HIM IN THE MORNING WE DID NOT LOOK FOR HIS PRESENCE AT
NIGHT
NO SOONER WERE WE SEATED AT LESSONS HOWEVER THAN HE APPEARED
I OWN I WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM SO GLAD THAT I COULD NOT HELP GREETING HIS
ARRIVAL WITH A SMILE AND WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE SAME SEAT ABOUT
WHICH SO SERIOUS A MISUNDERSTANDING HAD FORMERLY ARISEN I TOOK GOOD
CARE NOT TO MAKE TOO MUCH ROOM FOR HIM HE WATCHED WITH A JEALOUS
SIDE LONG LOOK TO SEE WHETHER I SHRANK AWAY BUT I DID NOT THOUGH THE
BENCH WAS A LITTLE CROWDED
I WAS LOSING THE EARLY IMPULSE TO RECOIL
FROM M
PAUL
HABITUATED TO THE PALETT AND BONNET GREC THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THESE GARMENTS SEEMED NO LONGER UNCOMFORTABLE OR VERY
FORMIDABLE
I DID NOT NOW SIT RESTRAINED ASPHYXIE AS HE USED TO
SAY AT HIS SIDE I STIRRED WHEN I WISHED TO STIR COUGHED WHEN IT WAS
NECESSARY EVEN YAWNED WHEN I WAS TIRED DID IN SHORT WHAT I PLEASED
BLINDLY RELIANT UPON HIS INDULGENCE
NOR DID MY TEMERITY THIS EVENING
AT LEAST MEET THE PUNISHMENT IT PERHAPS MERITED HE WAS BOTH INDULGENT
AND GOOD NATURED NOT A CROSS GLANCE SHOT FROM HIS EYES NOT A HASTY
WORD LEFT HIS LIPS
TILL THE VERY CLOSE OF THE EVENING HE DID NOT
INDEED ADDRESS ME AT ALL YET I FELT SOMEHOW THAT HE WAS FULL OF
FRIENDLINESS
SILENCE IS OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND BREATHES DIFFERENT
MEANINGS NO WORDS COULD INSPIRE A PLEASANTER CONTENT THAN DID M
PAUL'S WORLDLESS PRESENCE
WHEN THE TRAY CAME IN AND THE BUSTLE OF
SUPPER COMMENCED HE JUST SAID AS HE RETIRED THAT HE WISHED ME A GOOD
NIGHT AND SWEET DREAMS AND A GOOD NIGHT AND SWEET DREAMS I HAD
CHAPTER XXX
M
PAUL
YET THE READER IS ADVISED NOT TO BE IN ANY HURRY WITH HIS KINDLY
CONCLUSIONS OR TO SUPPOSE WITH AN OVER HASTY CHARITY THAT FROM THAT
DAY M
PAUL BECAME A CHANGED CHARACTER EASY TO LIVE WITH AND NO
LONGER APT TO FLASH DANGER AND DISCOMFORT ROUND HIM
NO HE WAS NATURALLY A LITTLE MAN OF UNREASONABLE MOODS
WHEN
OVER WROUGHT WHICH HE OFTEN WAS HE BECAME ACUTELY IRRITABLE AND
BESIDES HIS VEINS WERE DARK WITH A LIVID BELLADONNA TINCTURE THE
ESSENCE OF JEALOUSY
I DO NOT MEAN MERELY THE TENDER JEALOUSY OF THE
HEART BUT THAT STERNER NARROWER SENTIMENT WHOSE SEAT IS IN THE HEAD
I USED TO THINK AS I SAT LOOKING AT M
PAUL WHILE HE WAS KNITTING HIS
BROW OR PROTRUDING HIS LIP OVER SOME EXERCISE OF MINE WHICH HAD NOT AS
MANY FAULTS AS HE WISHED FOR HE LIKED ME TO COMMIT FAULTS A KNOT OF
BLUNDERS WAS SWEET TO HIM AS A CLUSTER OF NUTS THAT HE HAD POINTS OF
RESEMBLANCE TO NAPOLEON BONAPARTE
I THINK SO STILL
IN A SHAMELESS DISREGARD OF MAGNANIMITY HE RESEMBLED THE GREAT
EMPEROR
M
PAUL WOULD HAVE QUARRELLED WITH TWENTY LEARNED WOMEN WOULD
HAVE UNBLUSHINGLY CARRIED ON A SYSTEM OF PETTY BICKERING AND
RECRIMINATION WITH A WHOLE CAPITAL OF COTERIES NEVER TROUBLING HIMSELF
ABOUT LOSS OR LACK OF DIGNITY
HE WOULD HAVE EXILED FIFTY MADAME DE
STALS IF THEY HAD ANNOYED OFFENDED OUTRIVALLED OR OPPOSED HIM
I WELL REMEMBER A HOT EPISODE OF HIS WITH A CERTAIN MADAME PANACHE A
LADY TEMPORARILY EMPLOYED BY MADAME BECK TO GIVE LESSONS IN HISTORY
SHE WAS CLEVER THAT IS SHE KNEW A GOOD DEAL AND BESIDES THOROUGHLY
POSSESSED THE ART OF MAKING THE MOST OF WHAT SHE KNEW OF WORDS AND
CONFIDENCE SHE HELD UNLIMITED COMMAND
HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE WAS FAR
FROM DESTITUTE OF ADVANTAGES I BELIEVE MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE
PRONOUNCED HER A FINE WOMAN AND YET THERE WERE POINTS IN HER ROBUST
AND AMPLE ATTRACTIONS AS WELL AS IN HER BUSTLING AND DEMONSTRATIVE
PRESENCE WHICH IT APPEARED THE NICE AND CAPRICIOUS TASTES OF M
PAUL
COULD NOT AWAY WITH
THE SOUND OF HER VOICE ECHOING THROUGH THE CARR
WOULD PUT HIM INTO A STRANGE TAKING HER LONG FREE STEP ALMOST
STRIDE ALONG THE CORRIDOR WOULD OFTEN MAKE HIM SNATCH UP HIS PAPERS
AND DECAMP ON THE INSTANT
WITH MALICIOUS INTENT HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF ONE DAY TO INTRUDE ON HER
CLASS AS QUICK AS LIGHTNING HE GATHERED HER METHOD OF INSTRUCTION IT
DIFFERED FROM A PET PLAN OF HIS OWN
WITH LITTLE CEREMONY AND LESS
COURTESY HE POINTED OUT WHAT HE TERMED HER ERRORS
WHETHER HE EXPECTED
SUBMISSION AND ATTENTION I KNOW NOT HE MET AN ACRID OPPOSITION
ACCOMPANIED BY A ROUND REPRIMAND FOR HIS CERTAINLY UNJUSTIFIABLE
INTERFERENCE
INSTEAD OF WITHDRAWING WITH DIGNITY AS HE MIGHT STILL HAVE DONE HE
THREW DOWN THE GAUNTLET OF DEFIANCE
MADAME PANACHE BELLICOSE AS A
PENTHESILEA PICKED IT UP IN A MINUTE
SHE SNAPPED HER FINGERS IN THE
INTERMEDDLER'S FACE SHE RUSHED UPON HIM WITH A STORM OF WORDS
M
EMANUEL WAS ELOQUENT BUT MADAME PANACHE WAS VOLUBLE
A SYSTEM OF
FIERCE ANTAGONISM ENSUED
INSTEAD OF LAUGHING IN HIS SLEEVE AT HIS FAIR
FOE WITH ALL HER SORE AMOUR PROPRE AND LOUD SELF ASSERTION M
PAUL
DETESTED HER WITH INTENSE SERIOUSNESS HE HONOURED HER WITH HIS EARNEST
FURY HE PURSUED HER VINDICTIVELY AND IMPLACABLY REFUSING TO REST
PEACEABLY IN HIS BED TO DERIVE DUE BENEFIT FROM HIS MEALS OR EVEN
SERENELY TO RELISH HIS CIGAR TILL SHE WAS FAIRLY ROOTED OUT OF THE
ESTABLISHMENT
THE PROFESSOR CONQUERED BUT I CANNOT SAY THAT THE
LAURELS OF THIS VICTORY SHADOWED GRACEFULLY HIS TEMPLES
ONCE I
VENTURED TO HINT AS MUCH
TO MY GREAT SURPRISE HE ALLOWED THAT I MIGHT
BE RIGHT BUT AVERRED THAT WHEN BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH EITHER MEN OR
WOMEN OF THE COARSE SELF COMPLACENT QUALITY WHEREOF MADAME PANACHE
WAS A SPECIMEN HE HAD NO CONTROL OVER HIS OWN PASSIONS AN UNSPEAKABLE
AND ACTIVE AVERSION IMPELLED HIM TO A WAR OF EXTERMINATION
THREE MONTHS AFTERWARDS HEARING THAT HIS VANQUISHED FOE HAD MET WITH
REVERSES AND WAS LIKELY TO BE REALLY DISTRESSED FOR WANT OF
EMPLOYMENT HE FORGOT HIS HATRED AND ALIKE ACTIVE IN GOOD AND EVIL HE
MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TILL HE FOUND HER A PLACE
UPON HER COMING TO
MAKE UP FORMER DIFFERENCES AND THANK HIM FOR HIS RECENT KINDNESS THE
OLD VOICE A LITTLE LOUD THE OLD MANNER A LITTLE FORWARD SO ACTED
UPON HIM THAT IN TEN MINUTES HE STARTED UP AND BOWED HER OR RATHER
HIMSELF OUT OF THE ROOM IN A TRANSPORT OF NERVOUS IRRITATION
TO PURSUE A SOMEWHAT AUDACIOUS PARALLEL IN A LOVE OF POWER IN AN
EAGER GRASP AFTER SUPREMACY M
EMANUEL WAS LIKE BONAPARTE
HE WAS A
MAN NOT ALWAYS TO BE SUBMITTED TO
SOMETIMES IT WAS NEEDFUL TO RESIST
IT WAS RIGHT TO STAND STILL TO LOOK UP INTO HIS EYES AND TELL HIM THAT
HIS REQUIREMENTS WENT BEYOND REASON THAT HIS ABSOLUTISM VERGED ON
TYRANNY
THE DAWNINGS THE FIRST DEVELOPMENTS OF PECULIAR TALENT APPEARING
WITHIN HIS RANGE AND UNDER HIS RULE CURIOUSLY EXCITED EVEN DISTURBED
HIM
HE WATCHED ITS STRUGGLE INTO LIFE WITH A SCOWL HE HELD BACK HIS
HAND PERHAPS SAID COME ON IF YOU HAVE STRENGTH BUT WOULD NOT AID
THE BIRTH
WHEN THE PANG AND PERIL OF THE FIRST CONFLICT WERE OVER WHEN THE
BREATH OF LIFE WAS DRAWN WHEN HE SAW THE LUNGS EXPAND AND CONTRACT
WHEN HE FELT THE HEART BEAT AND DISCOVERED LIFE IN THE EYE HE DID NOT
YET OFFER TO FOSTER
PROVE YOURSELF TRUE ERE I CHERISH YOU WAS HIS ORDINANCE AND HOW
DIFFICULT HE MADE THAT PROOF WHAT THORNS AND BRIERS WHAT FLINTS HE
STREWED IN THE PATH OF FEET NOT INURED TO ROUGH TRAVEL HE WATCHED
TEARLESSLY ORDEALS THAT HE EXACTED SHOULD BE PASSED
THROUGH FEARLESSLY
HE FOLLOWED FOOTPRINTS THAT AS THEY APPROACHED
THE BOURNE WERE SOMETIMES MARKED IN BLOOD FOLLOWED THEM GRIMLY
HOLDING THE AUSTEREST POLICE WATCH OVER THE PAIN PRESSED PILGRIM
AND
WHEN AT LAST HE ALLOWED A REST BEFORE SLUMBER MIGHT CLOSE THE EYELIDS
HE OPENED THOSE SAME LIDS WIDE WITH PITILESS FINGER AND THUMB AND
GAZED DEEP THROUGH THE PUPIL AND THE IRIDS INTO THE BRAIN INTO THE
HEART TO SEARCH IF VANITY OR PRIDE OR FALSEHOOD IN ANY OF ITS
SUBTLEST FORMS WAS DISCOVERABLE IN THE FURTHEST RECESS OF EXISTENCE
IF AT LAST HE LET THE NEOPHYTE SLEEP IT WAS BUT A MOMENT HE WOKE
HIM SUDDENLY UP TO APPLY NEW TESTS HE SENT HIM ON IRKSOME ERRANDS WHEN
HE WAS STAGGERING WITH WEARINESS HE TRIED THE TEMPER THE SENSE AND
THE HEALTH AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN EVERY SEVEREST TEST HAD BEEN APPLIED
AND ENDURED WHEN THE MOST CORROSIVE AQUAFORTIS HAD BEEN USED AND
FAILED TO TARNISH THE ORE THAT HE ADMITTED IT GENUINE AND STILL IN
CLOUDED SILENCE STAMPED IT WITH HIS DEEP BRAND OF APPROVAL
I SPEAK NOT IGNORANT OF THESE EVILS
TILL THE DATE AT WHICH THE LAST CHAPTER CLOSES M
PAUL HAD NOT BEEN MY
PROFESSOR HE HAD NOT GIVEN ME LESSONS BUT ABOUT THAT TIME
ACCIDENTALLY HEARING ME ONE DAY ACKNOWLEDGE AN IGNORANCE OF SOME BRANCH
OF EDUCATION I THINK IT WAS ARITHMETIC WHICH WOULD HAVE DISGRACED A
CHARITY SCHOOL BOY AS HE VERY TRULY REMARKED HE TOOK ME IN HAND
EXAMINED ME FIRST FOUND ME I NEED NOT SAY ABUNDANTLY DEFICIENT GAVE
ME SOME BOOKS AND APPOINTED ME SOME TASKS
HE DID THIS AT FIRST WITH PLEASURE INDEED WITH UNCONCEALED EXULTATION
CONDESCENDING TO SAY THAT HE BELIEVED I WAS BONNE ET PAS TROP FAIBLE
I E
WELL ENOUGH DISPOSED AND NOT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF PARTS BUT
OWING HE SUPPOSED TO ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES AS YET IN A STATE OF
WRETCHEDLY IMPERFECT MENTAL DEVELOPMENT
THE BEGINNING OF ALL EFFORT HAS INDEED WITH ME BEEN MARKED BY A
PRETERNATURAL IMBECILITY
I NEVER COULD EVEN IN FORMING A COMMON
ACQUAINTANCE ASSERT OR PROVE A CLAIM TO AVERAGE QUICKNESS
A
DEPRESSING AND DIFFICULT PASSAGE HAS PREFACED EVERY NEW PAGE I HAVE
TURNED IN LIFE
SO LONG AS THIS PASSAGE LASTED M
PAUL WAS VERY KIND VERY GOOD VERY
FORBEARING HE SAW THE SHARP PAIN INFLICTED AND FELT THE WEIGHTY
HUMILIATION IMPOSED BY MY OWN SENSE OF INCAPACITY AND WORDS CAN HARDLY
DO JUSTICE TO HIS TENDERNESS AND HELPFULNESS
HIS OWN EYES WOULD
MOISTEN WHEN TEARS OF SHAME AND EFFORT CLOUDED MINE BURDENED AS HE
WAS WITH WORK HE WOULD STEAL HALF HIS BRIEF SPACE OF RECREATION TO
GIVE TO ME
BUT STRANGE GRIEF WHEN THAT HEAVY AND OVERCAST DAWN BEGAN AT LAST TO
YIELD TO DAY WHEN MY FACULTIES BEGAN TO STRUGGLE THEMSELVES FREE AND
MY TIME OF ENERGY AND FULFILMENT CAME WHEN I VOLUNTARILY DOUBLED
TREBLED QUADRUPLED THE TASKS HE SET TO PLEASE HIM AS I THOUGHT HIS
KINDNESS BECAME STERNNESS THE LIGHT CHANGED IN HIS EYES FROM A BEAM TO
A SPARK HE FRETTED HE OPPOSED HE CURBED ME IMPERIOUSLY THE MORE I
DID THE HARDER I WORKED THE LESS HE SEEMED CONTENT
SARCASMS OF WHICH
THE SEVERITY AMAZED AND PUZZLED ME HARASSED MY EARS THEN FLOWED OUT
THE BITTEREST INUENDOES AGAINST THE PRIDE OF INTELLECT I WAS VAGUELY
THREATENED WITH I KNOW NOT WHAT DOOM IF I EVER TRESPASSED THE LIMITS
PROPER TO MY SEX AND CONCEIVED A CONTRABAND APPETITE FOR UNFEMININE
KNOWLEDGE
ALAS I HAD NO SUCH APPETITE
WHAT I LOVED IT JOYED ME BY
ANY EFFORT TO CONTENT BUT THE NOBLE HUNGER FOR SCIENCE IN THE
ABSTRACT THE GODLIKE THIRST AFTER DISCOVERY THESE FEELINGS WERE KNOWN
TO ME BUT BY BRIEFEST FLASHES
YET WHEN M
PAUL SNEERED AT ME I WANTED TO POSSESS THEM MORE FULLY
HIS INJUSTICE STIRRED IN ME AMBITIOUS WISHES IT IMPARTED A STRONG
STIMULUS IT GAVE WINGS TO ASPIRATION
IN THE BEGINNING BEFORE I HAD PENETRATED TO MOTIVES THAT
UNCOMPREHENDED SNEER OF HIS MADE MY HEART ACHE BUT BY AND BY IT ONLY
WARMED THE BLOOD IN MY VEINS AND SENT ADDED ACTION TO MY PULSES
WHATEVER MY POWERS FEMININE OR THE CONTRARY GOD HAD GIVEN THEM AND I
FELT RESOLUTE TO BE ASHAMED OF NO FACULTY OF HIS BESTOWAL
THE COMBAT WAS VERY SHARP FOR A TIME
I SEEMED TO HAVE LOST M
PAUL'S
AFFECTION HE TREATED ME STRANGELY
IN HIS MOST UNJUST MOMENTS HE WOULD
INSINUATE THAT I HAD DECEIVED HIM WHEN I APPEARED WHAT HE CALLED
FAIBLE THAT IS INCOMPETENT HE SAID I HAD FEIGNED A FALSE
INCAPACITY
AGAIN HE WOULD TURN SUDDENLY ROUND AND ACCUSE ME OF THE
MOST FAR FETCHED IMITATIONS AND IMPOSSIBLE PLAGIARISMS ASSERTING THAT
I HAD EXTRACTED THE PITH OUT OF BOOKS I HAD NOT SO MUCH AS HEARD
OF AND OVER THE PERUSAL OF WHICH I SHOULD INFALLIBLY HAVE FALLEN DOWN
IN A SLEEP AS DEEP AS THAT OF EUTYCHUS
ONCE UPON HIS PREFERRING SUCH AN ACCUSATION I TURNED UPON HIM I ROSE
AGAINST HIM
GATHERING AN ARMFUL OF HIS BOOKS OUT OF MY DESK I FILLED
MY APRON AND POURED THEM IN A HEAP UPON HIS ESTRADE AT HIS FEET
TAKE THEM AWAY M
PAUL I SAID AND TEACH ME NO MORE
I NEVER ASKED
TO BE MADE LEARNED AND YOU COMPEL ME TO FEEL VERY PROFOUNDLY THAT
LEARNING IS NOT HAPPINESS
AND RETURNING TO MY DESK I LAID MY HEAD ON MY ARMS NOR WOULD I SPEAK
TO HIM FOR TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS
HE PAINED AND CHAGRINED ME
HIS
AFFECTION HAD BEEN VERY SWEET AND DEAR A PLEASURE NEW AND
INCOMPARABLE NOW THAT THIS SEEMED WITHDRAWN I CARED NOT FOR HIS
LESSONS
THE BOOKS HOWEVER WERE NOT TAKEN AWAY THEY WERE ALL RESTORED WITH
CAREFUL HAND TO THEIR PLACES AND HE CAME AS USUAL TO TEACH ME
HE MADE
HIS PEACE SOMEHOW TOO READILY PERHAPS I OUGHT TO HAVE STOOD OUT
LONGER BUT WHEN HE LOOKED KIND AND GOOD AND HELD OUT HIS HAND WITH
AMITY MEMORY REFUSED TO REPRODUCE WITH DUE FORCE HIS OPPRESSIVE
MOMENTS
AND THEN RECONCILEMENT IS ALWAYS SWEET
ON A CERTAIN MORNING A MESSAGE CAME FROM MY GODMOTHER INVITING ME TO
ATTEND SOME NOTABLE LECTURE TO BE DELIVERED IN THE SAME PUBLIC ROOMS
BEFORE DESCRIBED
DR
JOHN HAD BROUGHT THE MESSAGE HIMSELF AND
DELIVERED IT VERBALLY TO ROSINE WHO HAD NOT SCRUPLED TO FOLLOW THE
STEPS OF M
EMANUEL THEN PASSING TO THE FIRST CLASSE AND IN HIS
PRESENCE STAND CARRMENT BEFORE MY DESK HAND IN APRON POCKET AND
REHEARSE THE SAME SAUCILY AND ALOUD CONCLUDING WITH THE WORDS QU'IL
EST VRAIMENT BEAU MADEMOISELLE CE JEUNE DOCTEUR QUELS YEUX QUEL
REGARD TENEZ J'EN AI LE COEUR TOUT MU
WHEN SHE WAS GONE MY PROFESSOR DEMANDED OF ME WHY I SUFFERED CETTE
FILLE EFFRONTE CETTE CRATURE SANS PUDEUR TO ADDRESS ME IN SUCH
TERMS
I HAD NO PACIFYING ANSWER TO GIVE
THE TERMS WERE PRECISELY SUCH AS
ROSINE A YOUNG LADY IN WHOSE SKULL THE ORGANS OF REVERENCE AND RESERVE
WERE NOT LARGELY DEVELOPED WAS IN THE CONSTANT HABIT OF USING
BESIDES WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT THE YOUNG DOCTOR WAS TRUE ENOUGH
GRAHAM
WAS HANDSOME HE HAD FINE EYES AND A THRILLING GLANCE
AN
OBSERVATION TO THAT EFFECT ACTUALLY FORMED ITSELF INTO SOUND ON MY LIPS
ELLE NE DIT QUE LA VRIT I SAID
AH VOUS TROUVEZ
MAIS SANS DOUTE
THE LESSON TO WHICH WE HAD THAT DAY TO SUBMIT WAS SUCH AS TO MAKE US
VERY GLAD WHEN IT TERMINATED
AT ITS CLOSE THE RELEASED PUPILS RUSHED
OUT HALF TREMBLING HALF EXULTANT
I TOO WAS GOING
A MANDATE TO
REMAIN ARRESTED ME
I MUTTERED THAT I WANTED SOME FRESH AIR SADLY THE
STOVE WAS IN A GLOW THE CLASSE OVER HEATED
AN INEXORABLE VOICE MERELY
RECOMMENDED SILENCE AND THIS SALAMANDER FOR WHOM NO ROOM EVER SEEMED
TOO HOT SITTING DOWN BETWEEN MY DESK AND THE STOVE A SITUATION IN
WHICH HE OUGHT TO HAVE FELT BROILED BUT DID NOT PROCEEDED TO CONFRONT
ME WITH A GREEK QUOTATION
IN M
EMANUEL'S SOUL RANKLED A CHRONIC SUSPICION THAT I KNEW BOTH GREEK
AND LATIN
AS MONKEYS ARE SAID TO HAVE THE POWER OF SPEECH IF THEY
WOULD BUT USE IT AND ARE REPORTED TO CONCEAL THIS FACULTY IN FEAR OF
ITS BEING TURNED TO THEIR DETRIMENT SO TO ME WAS ASCRIBED A FUND OF
KNOWLEDGE WHICH I WAS SUPPOSED CRIMINALLY AND CRAFTILY TO CONCEAL
THE
PRIVILEGES OF A CLASSICAL EDUCATION IT WAS INSINUATED HAD BEEN
MINE ON FLOWERS OF HYMETTUS I HAD REVELLED A GOLDEN STORE HIVED IN
MEMORY NOW SILENTLY SUSTAINED MY EFFORTS AND PRIVILY NURTURED MY WITS
A HUNDRED EXPEDIENTS DID M
PAUL EMPLOY TO SURPRISE MY SECRET TO
WHEEDLE TO THREATEN TO STARTLE IT OUT OF ME
SOMETIMES HE PLACED
GREEK AND LATIN BOOKS IN MY WAY AND THEN WATCHED ME AS JOAN OF ARC'S
JAILORS TEMPTED HER WITH THE WARRIOR'S ACCOUTREMENTS AND LAY IN WAIT
FOR THE ISSUE
AGAIN HE QUOTED I KNOW NOT WHAT AUTHORS AND PASSAGES
AND WHILE ROLLING OUT THEIR SWEET AND SOUNDING LINES THE CLASSIC TONES
FELL MUSICALLY FROM HIS LIPS FOR HE HAD A GOOD VOICE REMARKABLE FOR
COMPASS MODULATION AND MATCHLESS EXPRESSION HE WOULD FIX ON ME A
VIGILANT PIERCING AND OFTEN MALICIOUS EYE
IT WAS EVIDENT HE
SOMETIMES EXPECTED GREAT DEMONSTRATIONS THEY NEVER OCCURRED HOWEVER
NOT COMPREHENDING OF COURSE I COULD NEITHER BE CHARMED NOR ANNOYED
BAFFLED ALMOST ANGRY HE STILL CLUNG TO HIS FIXED IDEA MY
SUSCEPTIBILITIES WERE PRONOUNCED MARBLE MY FACE A MASK
IT APPEARED AS
IF HE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCEPT THE HOMELY TRUTH AND TAKE ME FOR
WHAT I WAS MEN AND WOMEN TOO MUST HAVE DELUSION OF SOME SORT IF NOT
MADE READY TO THEIR HAND THEY WILL INVENT EXAGGERATION FOR THEMSELVES
AT MOMENTS I DID WISH THAT HIS SUSPICIONS HAD BEEN BETTER FOUNDED
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY RIGHT HAND TO POSSESS THE
TREASURES HE ASCRIBED TO ME
HE DESERVED CONDIGN PUNISHMENT FOR HIS
TESTY CROTCHETS
I COULD HAVE GLORIED IN BRINGING HOME TO HIM HIS WORST
APPREHENSIONS ASTOUNDINGLY REALIZED
I COULD HAVE EXULTED TO BURST ON
HIS VISION CONFRONT AND CONFOUND HIS LUNETTES ONE BLAZE OF
ACQUIREMENTS
OH WHY DID NOBODY UNDERTAKE TO MAKE ME CLEVER WHILE I
WAS YOUNG ENOUGH TO LEARN THAT I MIGHT BY ONE GRAND SUDDEN INHUMAN
REVELATION ONE COLD CRUEL OVERWHELMING TRIUMPH HAVE FOR EVER
CRUSHED THE MOCKING SPIRIT OUT OF PAUL CARL DAVID EMANUEL
ALAS NO SUCH FEAT WAS IN MY POWER
TO DAY AS USUAL HIS QUOTATIONS
FELL INEFFECTUAL HE SOON SHIFTED HIS GROUND
WOMEN OF INTELLECT WAS HIS NEXT THEME HERE HE WAS AT HOME
A WOMAN
OF INTELLECT IT APPEARED WAS A SORT OF LUSUS NATURAE A LUCKLESS
ACCIDENT A THING FOR WHICH THERE WAS NEITHER PLACE NOR USE IN
CREATION WANTED NEITHER AS WIFE NOR WORKER
BEAUTY ANTICIPATED HER IN
THE FIRST OFFICE
HE BELIEVED IN HIS SOUL THAT LOVELY PLACID AND
PASSIVE FEMININE MEDIOCRITY WAS THE ONLY PILLOW ON WHICH MANLY THOUGHT
AND SENSE COULD FIND REST FOR ITS ACHING TEMPLES AND AS TO WORK MALE
MIND ALONE COULD WORK TO ANY GOOD PRACTICAL RESULT HEIN
THIS HEIN WAS A NOTE OF INTERROGATION INTENDED TO DRAW FROM ME
CONTRADICTION OR OBJECTION
HOWEVER I ONLY SAID CELA NE ME REGARDE
PAS JE NE M'EN SOUCIE PAS AND PRESENTLY ADDED MAY I GO MONSIEUR
THEY HAVE RUNG THE BELL FOR THE SECOND DJEUNER I E LUNCHEON
WHAT OF THAT YOU ARE NOT HUNGRY
INDEED I WAS I SAID I HAD HAD NOTHING SINCE BREAKFAST AT SEVEN
AND SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TILL DINNER AT FIVE IF I MISSED THIS BELL
WELL HE WAS IN THE SAME PLIGHT BUT I MIGHT SHARE WITH HIM
AND HE BROKE IN TWO THE BRIOCHE INTENDED FOR HIS OWN REFRESHMENT AND
GAVE ME HALF
TRULY HIS BARK WAS WORSE THAN HIS BITE BUT THE REALLY
FORMIDABLE ATTACK WAS YET TO COME
WHILE EATING HIS CAKE I COULD NOT
FORBEAR EXPRESSING MY SECRET WISH THAT I REALLY KNEW ALL OF WHICH HE
ACCUSED ME
DID I SINCERELY FEEL MYSELF TO BE AN IGNORAMUS HE ASKED IN A
SOFTENED TONE
IF I HAD REPLIED MEEKLY BY AN UNQUALIFIED AFFIRMATIVE I BELIEVE HE
WOULD HAVE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FRIENDS ON
THE SPOT BUT I ANSWERED
NOT EXACTLY
I AM IGNORANT MONSIEUR IN THE KNOWLEDGE YOU ASCRIBE TO
ME BUT I SOMETIMES NOT ALWAYS FEEL A KNOWLEDGE OF MY OWN
WHAT DID I MEAN HE INQUIRED SHARPLY
UNABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION IN A BREATH I EVADED IT BY CHANGE OF
SUBJECT
HE HAD NOW FINISHED HIS HALF OF THE BRIOCHE FEELING SURE THAT
ON SO TRIFLING A FRAGMENT HE COULD NOT HAVE SATISFIED HIS APPETITE AS
INDEED I HAD NOT APPEASED MINE AND INHALING THE FRAGRANCE OF BAKED
APPLES AFAR FROM THE REFECTORY I VENTURED TO INQUIRE WHETHER HE DID
NOT ALSO PERCEIVE THAT AGREEABLE ODOUR
HE CONFESSED THAT HE DID
I
SAID IF HE WOULD LET ME OUT BY THE GARDEN DOOR AND PERMIT ME JUST TO
RUN ACROSS THE COURT I WOULD FETCH HIM A PLATEFUL AND ADDED THAT I
BELIEVED THEY WERE EXCELLENT AS GOTON HAD A VERY GOOD METHOD OF
BAKING OR RATHER STEWING FRUIT PUTTING IN A LITTLE SPICE SUGAR AND
A GLASS OR TWO OF VIN BLANC MIGHT I GO
PETITE GOURMANDE SAID HE SMILING I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN HOW PLEASED
YOU WERE WITH THE PT LA CRME I ONCE GAVE YOU AND YOU KNOW VERY
WELL AT THIS MOMENT THAT TO FETCH THE APPLES FOR ME WILL BE THE SAME
AS GETTING THEM FOR YOURSELF
GO THEN BUT COME BACK QUICKLY
AND AT LAST HE LIBERATED ME ON PAROLE
MY OWN PLAN WAS TO GO AND RETURN
WITH SPEED AND GOOD FAITH TO PUT THE PLATE IN AT THE DOOR AND THEN TO
VANISH INCONTINENT LEAVING ALL CONSEQUENCES FOR FUTURE SETTLEMENT
THAT INTOLERABLY KEEN INSTINCT OF HIS SEEMED TO HAVE ANTICIPATED MY
SCHEME HE MET ME AT THE THRESHOLD HURRIED ME INTO THE ROOM AND FIXED
ME IN A MINUTE IN MY FORMER SEAT
TAKING THE PLATE OF FRUIT FROM MY
HAND HE DIVIDED THE PORTION INTENDED ONLY FOR HIMSELF AND ORDERED ME
TO EAT MY SHARE
I COMPLIED WITH NO GOOD GRACE AND VEXED I SUPPOSE
BY MY RELUCTANCE HE OPENED A MASKED AND DANGEROUS BATTERY
ALL HE HAD
YET SAID I COULD COUNT AS MERE SOUND AND FURY SIGNIFYING NOTHING NOT
SO OF THE PRESENT ATTACK
IT CONSISTED IN AN UNREASONABLE PROPOSITION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEFORE
AFFLICTED ME NAMELY THAT ON THE NEXT PUBLIC EXAMINATION DAY I SHOULD
ENGAGE FOREIGNER AS I WAS TO TAKE MY PLACE ON THE FIRST FORM OF
FIRST CLASS PUPILS AND WITH THEM IMPROVISE A COMPOSITION IN FRENCH ON
ANY SUBJECT ANY SPECTATOR MIGHT DICTATE WITHOUT BENEFIT OF GRAMMAR OR
LEXICON
I KNEW WHAT THE RESULT OF SUCH AN EXPERIMENT WOULD BE
I TO WHOM
NATURE HAD DENIED THE IMPROMPTU FACULTY WHO IN PUBLIC WAS BY NATURE
A CYPHER WHOSE TIME OF MENTAL ACTIVITY EVEN WHEN ALONE WAS NOT UNDER
THE MERIDIAN SUN WHO NEEDED THE FRESH SILENCE OF MORNING OR THE
RECLUSE PEACE OF EVENING TO WIN FROM THE CREATIVE IMPULSE ONE EVIDENCE
OF HIS PRESENCE ONE PROOF OF HIS FORCE I WITH WHOM THAT IMPULSE WAS
THE MOST INTRACTABLE THE MOST CAPRICIOUS THE MOST MADDENING OF
MASTERS HIM BEFORE ME ALWAYS EXCEPTED A DEITY WHICH SOMETIMES UNDER
CIRCUMSTANCES APPARENTLY PROPITIOUS WOULD NOT SPEAK WHEN QUESTIONED
WOULD NOT HEAR WHEN APPEALED TO WOULD NOT WHEN SOUGHT BE FOUND BUT
WOULD STAND ALL COLD ALL INDURATED ALL GRANITE A DARK BAAL WITH
CARVEN LIPS AND BLANK EYE BALLS AND BREAST LIKE THE STONE FACE OF A
TOMB AND AGAIN SUDDENLY AT SOME TURN SOME SOUND SOME
LONG TREMBLING SOB OF THE WIND AT SOME RUSHING PAST OF AN UNSEEN
STREAM OF ELECTRICITY THE IRRATIONAL DEMON WOULD WAKE UNSOLICITED
WOULD STIR STRANGELY ALIVE WOULD RUSH FROM ITS PEDESTAL LIKE A
PERTURBED DAGON CALLING TO ITS VOTARY FOR A SACRIFICE WHATEVER THE
HOUR TO ITS VICTIM FOR SOME BLOOD OR SOME BREATH WHATEVER THE
CIRCUMSTANCE OR SCENE ROUSING ITS PRIEST TREACHEROUSLY PROMISING
VATICINATION PERHAPS FILLING ITS TEMPLE WITH A STRANGE HUM OF ORACLES
BUT SURE TO GIVE HALF THE SIGNIFICANCE TO FATEFUL WINDS AND GRUDGING
TO THE DESPERATE LISTENER EVEN A MISERABLE REMNANT YIELDING IT
SORDIDLY AS THOUGH EACH WORD HAD BEEN A DROP OF THE DEATHLESS ICHOR OF
ITS OWN DARK VEINS
AND THIS TYRANT I WAS TO COMPEL INTO BONDAGE AND
MAKE IT IMPROVISE A THEME ON A SCHOOL ESTRADE BETWEEN A MATHILDE AND
A CORALIE UNDER THE EYE OF A MADAME BECK FOR THE PLEASURE AND TO THE
INSPIRATION OF A BOURGEOIS OF LABASSECOUR
UPON THIS ARGUMENT M
PAUL AND I DID BATTLE MORE THAN ONCE STRONG
BATTLE WITH CONFUSED NOISE OF DEMAND AND REJECTION EXACTION AND
REPULSE
ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY I WAS SOUNDLY RATED
THE OBSTINACY OF MY WHOLE
SEX IT SEEMS WAS CONCENTRATED IN ME I HAD AN ORGUEIL DE DIABLE I
FEARED TO FAIL FORSOOTH WHAT DID IT MATTER WHETHER I FAILED OR NOT
WHO WAS I THAT I SHOULD NOT FAIL LIKE MY BETTERS IT WOULD DO ME GOOD
TO FAIL
HE WANTED TO SEE ME WORSTED I KNEW HE DID AND ONE MINUTE HE
PAUSED TO TAKE BREATH
WOULD I SPEAK NOW AND BE TRACTABLE
NEVER WOULD I BE TRACTABLE IN THIS MATTER
LAW ITSELF SHOULD NOT
COMPEL ME
I WOULD PAY A FINE OR UNDERGO AN IMPRISONMENT RATHER THAN
WRITE FOR A SHOW AND TO ORDER PERCHED UP ON A PLATFORM
COULD SOFTER MOTIVES INFLUENCE ME WOULD I YIELD FOR FRIENDSHIP'S
SAKE
NOT A WHIT NOT A HAIR BREADTH
NO FORM OF FRIENDSHIP UNDER THE SUN
HAD A RIGHT TO EXACT SUCH A CONCESSION
NO TRUE FRIENDSHIP WOULD HARASS
ME THUS
HE SUPPOSED THEN WITH A SNEER M
PAUL COULD SNEER SUPREMELY CURLING
HIS LIP OPENING HIS NOSTRILS CONTRACTING HIS EYELIDS HE SUPPOSED
THERE WAS BUT ONE FORM OF APPEAL TO WHICH I WOULD LISTEN AND OF THAT
FORM IT WAS NOT FOR HIM TO MAKE USE
UNDER CERTAIN PERSUASIONS FROM CERTAIN QUARTERS JE VOUS VOIS D'ICI
SAID HE EAGERLY SUBSCRIBING TO THE SACRIFICE PASSIONATELY ARMING FOR
THE EFFORT
MAKING A SIMPLETON A WARNING AND AN EXAMPLE OF MYSELF BEFORE A
HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THE 'PAPAS' AND 'MAMMAS' OF VILLETTE
AND HERE LOSING PATIENCE I BROKE OUT AFRESH WITH A CRY THAT I WANTED
TO BE LIBERATED TO GET OUT INTO THE AIR I WAS ALMOST IN A FEVER
CHUT SAID THE INEXORABLE THIS WAS A MERE PRETEXT TO RUN AWAY HE
WAS NOT HOT WITH THE STOVE CLOSE AT HIS BACK HOW COULD I SUFFER
THOROUGHLY SCREENED BY HIS PERSON
I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS CONSTITUTION
I KNEW NOTHING OF THE NATURAL
HISTORY OF SALAMANDERS
FOR MY OWN PART I WAS A PHLEGMATIC ISLANDER
AND SITTING IN AN OVEN DID NOT AGREE WITH ME AT LEAST MIGHT I STEP TO
THE WELL AND GET A GLASS OF WATER THE SWEET APPLES HAD MADE ME
THIRSTY
IF THAT WAS ALL HE WOULD DO MY ERRAND
HE WENT TO FETCH THE WATER
OF COURSE WITH A DOOR ONLY ON THE LATCH
BEHIND ME I LOST NOT MY OPPORTUNITY
ERE HIS RETURN HIS HALF WORRIED
PREY HAD ESCAPED
CHAPTER XXXI
THE DRYAD
THE SPRING WAS ADVANCING AND THE WEATHER HAD TURNED SUDDENLY WARM
THIS CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE BROUGHT WITH IT FOR ME AS PROBABLY FOR MANY
OTHERS TEMPORARY DECREASE OF STRENGTH
SLIGHT EXERTION AT THIS TIME
LEFT ME OVERCOME WITH FATIGUE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS ENTAILED LANGUID DAYS
ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON HAVING WALKED THE DISTANCE OF HALF A LEAGUE TO
THE PROTESTANT CHURCH I CAME BACK WEARY AND EXHAUSTED AND TAKING
REFUGE IN MY SOLITARY SANCTUARY THE FIRST CLASSE I WAS GLAD TO SIT
DOWN AND TO MAKE OF MY DESK A PILLOW FOR MY ARMS AND HEAD
AWHILE I LISTENED TO THE LULLABY OF BEES HUMMING IN THE BERCEAU AND
WATCHED THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR AND THE TENDER LIGHTLY STREWN SPRING
FOLIAGE MADAME BECK AND A GAY PARTY OF FRIENDS WHOM SHE HAD
ENTERTAINED THAT DAY AT DINNER AFTER MORNING MASS WALKING IN THE
CENTRE ALLEY UNDER ORCHARD BOUGHS DRESSED AT THIS SEASON IN BLOSSOM
AND WEARING A COLOURING AS PURE AND WARM AS MOUNTAIN SNOW AT SUN RISE
MY PRINCIPAL ATTRACTION TOWARDS THIS GROUP OF GUESTS LAY I REMEMBER
IN ONE FIGURE THAT OF A HANDSOME YOUNG GIRL WHOM I HAD SEEN BEFORE AS
A VISITOR AT MADAME BECK'S AND OF WHOM I HAD BEEN VAGUELY TOLD THAT
SHE WAS A FILLEULE OR GOD DAUGHTER OF M
EMANUEL'S AND THAT
BETWEEN HER MOTHER OR AUNT OR SOME OTHER FEMALE RELATION OF HERS AND
THE PROFESSOR HAD EXISTED OF OLD A SPECIAL FRIENDSHIP
M
PAUL WAS NOT
OF THE HOLIDAY BAND TO DAY BUT I HAD SEEN THIS YOUNG GIRL WITH HIM ERE
NOW AND AS FAR AS DISTANT OBSERVATION COULD ENABLE ME TO JUDGE SHE
SEEMED TO ENJOY HIM WITH THE FRANK EASE OF A WARD WITH AN INDULGENT
GUARDIAN
I HAD SEEN HER RUN UP TO HIM PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS AND
HANG UPON HIM
ONCE WHEN SHE DID SO A CURIOUS SENSATION HAD STRUCK
THROUGH ME A DISAGREEABLE ANTICIPATORY SENSATION ONE OF THE FAMILY OF
PRESENTIMENTS I SUPPOSE BUT I REFUSED TO ANALYZE OR DWELL UPON IT
WHILE WATCHING THIS GIRL MADEMOISELLE SAUVEUR BY NAME AND FOLLOWING
THE GLEAM OF HER BRIGHT SILK ROBE SHE WAS ALWAYS RICHLY DRESSED FOR
SHE WAS SAID TO BE WEALTHY THROUGH THE FLOWERS AND THE GLANCING LEAVES
OF TENDER EMERALD MY EYES BECAME DAZZLED THEY CLOSED MY LASSITUDE
THE WARMTH OF THE DAY THE HUM OF BEES AND BIRDS ALL LULLED ME AND AT
LAST I SLEPT
TWO HOURS STOLE OVER ME
ERE I WOKE THE SUN HAD DECLINED OUT OF SIGHT
BEHIND THE TOWERING HOUSES THE GARDEN AND THE ROOM WERE GREY BEES HAD
GONE HOMEWARD AND THE FLOWERS WERE CLOSING THE PARTY OF GUESTS TOO
HAD VANISHED EACH ALLEY WAS VOID
ON WAKING I FELT MUCH AT EASE NOT CHILL AS I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
AFTER SITTING SO STILL FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS MY CHEEK AND ARMS WERE
NOT BENUMBED BY PRESSURE AGAINST THE HARD DESK
NO WONDER
INSTEAD OF
THE BARE WOOD ON WHICH I HAD LAID THEM I FOUND A THICK SHAWL
CAREFULLY FOLDED SUBSTITUTED FOR SUPPORT AND ANOTHER SHAWL BOTH
TAKEN FROM THE CORRIDOR WHERE SUCH THINGS HUNG WRAPPED WARMLY ROUND ME
WHO HAD DONE THIS WHO WAS MY FRIEND WHICH OF THE TEACHERS WHICH OF
THE PUPILS NONE EXCEPT ST
PIERRE WAS INIMICAL TO ME BUT WHICH OF
THEM HAD THE ART THE THOUGHT THE HABIT OF BENEFITING THUS TENDERLY
WHICH OF THEM HAD A STEP SO QUIET A HAND SO GENTLE BUT I SHOULD HAVE
HEARD OR FELT HER IF SHE HAD APPROACHED OR TOUCHED ME IN A DAY SLEEP
AS TO GINEVRA FANSHAWE THAT BRIGHT YOUNG CREATURE WAS NOT GENTLE AT
ALL AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PULLED ME OUT OF MY CHAIR IF SHE HAD
MEDDLED IN THE MATTER
I SAID AT LAST IT IS MADAME BECK'S DOING SHE
HAS COME IN SEEN ME ASLEEP AND THOUGHT I MIGHT TAKE COLD
SHE
CONSIDERS ME A USEFUL MACHINE ANSWERING WELL THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT
WAS HIRED SO WOULD NOT HAVE ME NEEDLESSLY INJURED
AND NOW
METHOUGHT I'LL TAKE A WALK THE EVENING IS FRESH AND NOT VERY CHILL
SO I OPENED THE GLASS DOOR AND STEPPED INTO THE BERCEAU
I WENT TO MY OWN ALLEY HAD IT BEEN DARK OR EVEN DUSK I SHOULD HAVE
HARDLY VENTURED THERE FOR I HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN THE CURIOUS ILLUSION
OF VISION IF ILLUSION IT WERE EXPERIENCED IN THAT PLACE SOME MONTHS
AGO
BUT A RAY OF THE SETTING SUN BURNISHED STILL THE GREY CROWN OF
JEAN BAPTISTE NOR HAD ALL THE BIRDS OF THE GARDEN YET VANISHED INTO
THEIR NESTS AMONGST THE TUFTED SHRUBS AND THICK WALL IVY
I PACED UP
AND DOWN THINKING ALMOST THE SAME THOUGHTS I HAD PONDERED THAT NIGHT
WHEN I BURIED MY GLASS JAR HOW I SHOULD MAKE SOME ADVANCE IN LIFE
TAKE ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS AN INDEPENDENT POSITION FOR THIS TRAIN OF
REFLECTION THOUGH NOT LATELY PURSUED HAD NEVER BY ME BEEN WHOLLY
ABANDONED AND WHENEVER A CERTAIN EYE WAS AVERTED FROM ME AND A
CERTAIN COUNTENANCE GREW DARK WITH UNKINDNESS AND INJUSTICE INTO THAT
TRACK OF SPECULATION DID I AT ONCE STRIKE SO THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE I
HAD LAID HALF A PLAN
LIVING COSTS LITTLE SAID I TO MYSELF IN THIS ECONOMICAL TOWN OF
VILLETTE WHERE PEOPLE ARE MORE SENSIBLE THAN I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE IN
DEAR OLD ENGLAND INFINITELY LESS WORRIED ABOUT APPEARANCE AND LESS
EMULOUS OF DISPLAY WHERE NOBODY IS IN THE LEAST ASHAMED TO BE QUITE AS
HOMELY AND SAVING AS HE FINDS CONVENIENT
HOUSE RENT IN A PRUDENTLY
CHOSEN SITUATION NEED NOT BE HIGH
WHEN I SHALL HAVE SAVED ONE
THOUSAND FRANCS I WILL TAKE A TENEMENT WITH ONE LARGE ROOM AND TWO OR
THREE SMALLER ONES FURNISH THE FIRST WITH A FEW BENCHES AND DESKS A
BLACK TABLEAU AN ESTRADE FOR MYSELF UPON IT A CHAIR AND TABLE WITH A
SPONGE AND SOME WHITE CHALKS BEGIN WITH TAKING DAY PUPILS AND SO WORK
MY WAY UPWARDS
MADAME BECK'S COMMENCEMENT WAS AS I HAVE OFTEN HEARD
HER SAY FROM NO HIGHER STARTING POINT AND WHERE IS SHE NOW ALL THESE
PREMISES AND THIS GARDEN ARE HERS BOUGHT WITH HER MONEY SHE HAS A
COMPETENCY ALREADY SECURED FOR OLD AGE AND A FLOURISHING ESTABLISHMENT
UNDER HER DIRECTION WHICH WILL FURNISH A CAREER FOR HER CHILDREN
COURAGE LUCY SNOWE WITH SELF DENIAL AND ECONOMY NOW AND STEADY
EXERTION BY AND BY AN OBJECT IN LIFE NEED NOT FAIL YOU
VENTURE NOT TO
COMPLAIN THAT SUCH AN OBJECT IS TOO SELFISH TOO LIMITED AND LACKS
INTEREST BE CONTENT TO LABOUR FOR INDEPENDENCE UNTIL YOU HAVE PROVED
BY WINNING THAT PRIZE YOUR RIGHT TO LOOK HIGHER
BUT AFTERWARDS IS
THERE NOTHING MORE FOR ME IN LIFE NO TRUE HOME NOTHING TO BE DEARER
TO ME THAN MYSELF AND BY ITS PARAMOUNT PRECIOUSNESS TO DRAW FROM ME
BETTER THINGS THAN I CARE TO CULTURE FOR MYSELF ONLY NOTHING AT WHOSE
FEET I CAN WILLINGLY LAY DOWN THE WHOLE BURDEN OF HUMAN EGOTISM AND
GLORIOUSLY TAKE UP THE NOBLER CHARGE OF LABOURING AND LIVING FOR
OTHERS I SUPPOSE LUCY SNOWE THE ORB OF YOUR LIFE IS NOT TO BE SO
ROUNDED FOR YOU THE CRESCENT PHASE MUST SUFFICE
VERY GOOD
I SEE A
HUGE MASS OF MY FELLOW CREATURES IN NO BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES
I SEE THAT
A GREAT MANY MEN AND MORE WOMEN HOLD THEIR SPAN OF LIFE ON CONDITIONS
OF DENIAL AND PRIVATION
I FIND NO REASON WHY I SHOULD BE OF THE FEW
FAVOURED
I BELIEVE IN SOME BLENDING OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE SWEETENING
THE WORST LOTS
I BELIEVE THAT THIS LIFE IS NOT ALL NEITHER THE
BEGINNING NOR THE END
I BELIEVE WHILE I TREMBLE I TRUST WHILE I WEEP
SO THIS SUBJECT IS DONE WITH
IT IS RIGHT TO LOOK OUR LIFE ACCOUNTS
BRAVELY IN THE FACE NOW AND THEN AND SETTLE THEM HONESTLY
AND HE IS A
POOR SELF SWINDLER WHO LIES TO HIMSELF WHILE HE RECKONS THE ITEMS AND
SETS DOWN UNDER THE HEAD HAPPINESS THAT WHICH IS MISERY
CALL
ANGUISH ANGUISH AND DESPAIR DESPAIR WRITE BOTH DOWN IN STRONG
CHARACTERS WITH A RESOLUTE PEN YOU WILL THE BETTER PAY YOUR DEBT TO
DOOM
FALSIFY INSERT PRIVILEGE WHERE YOU SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN PAIN
AND SEE IF YOUR MIGHTY CREDITOR WILL ALLOW THE FRAUD TO PASS OR ACCEPT
THE COIN WITH WHICH YOU WOULD CHEAT HIM
OFFER TO THE STRONGEST IF THE
DARKEST ANGEL OF GOD'S HOST WATER WHEN HE HAS ASKED BLOOD WILL HE
TAKE IT NOT A WHOLE PALE SEA FOR ONE RED DROP
I SETTLED ANOTHER
ACCOUNT
PAUSING BEFORE METHUSALEH THE GIANT AND PATRIARCH OF THE GARDEN AND
LEANING MY BROW AGAINST HIS KNOTTY TRUNK MY FOOT RESTED ON THE STONE
SEALING THE SMALL SEPULCHRE AT HIS ROOT AND I RECALLED THE PASSAGE OF
FEELING THEREIN BURIED I RECALLED DR
JOHN MY WARM AFFECTION FOR HIM
MY FAITH IN HIS EXCELLENCE MY DELIGHT IN HIS GRACE
WHAT WAS BECOME OF
THAT CURIOUS ONE SIDED FRIENDSHIP WHICH WAS HALF MARBLE AND HALF LIFE
ONLY ON ONE HAND TRUTH AND ON THE OTHER PERHAPS A JEST
WAS THIS FEELING DEAD I DO NOT KNOW BUT IT WAS BURIED
SOMETIMES I
THOUGHT THE TOMB UNQUIET AND DREAMED STRANGELY OF DISTURBED EARTH AND
OF HAIR STILL GOLDEN AND LIVING OBTRUDED THROUGH COFFIN CHINKS
HAD I BEEN TOO HASTY I USED TO ASK MYSELF AND THIS QUESTION WOULD
OCCUR WITH A CRUEL SHARPNESS AFTER SOME BRIEF CHANCE INTERVIEW WITH DR
JOHN
HE HAD STILL SUCH KIND LOOKS SUCH A WARM HAND HIS VOICE STILL
KEPT SO PLEASANT A TONE FOR MY NAME I NEVER LIKED LUCY SO WELL AS
WHEN HE UTTERED IT
BUT I LEARNED IN TIME THAT THIS BENIGNITY THIS
CORDIALITY THIS MUSIC BELONGED IN NO SHAPE TO ME IT WAS A PART OF
HIMSELF IT WAS THE HONEY OF HIS TEMPER IT WAS THE BALM OF HIS MELLOW
MOOD HE IMPARTED IT AS THE RIPE FRUIT REWARDS WITH SWEETNESS THE
RIFLING BEE HE DIFFUSED IT ABOUT HIM AS SWEET PLANTS SHED THEIR
PERFUME
DOES THE NECTARINE LOVE EITHER THE BEE OR BIRD IT FEEDS IS
THE SWEETBRIAR ENAMOURED OF THE AIR
GOOD NIGHT DR
JOHN YOU ARE GOOD YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT YOU ARE NOT
MINE
GOOD NIGHT AND GOD BLESS YOU
THUS I CLOSED MY MUSINGS
GOOD NIGHT LEFT MY LIPS IN SOUND I HEARD
THE WORDS SPOKEN AND THEN I HEARD AN ECHO QUITE CLOSE
GOOD NIGHT MADEMOISELLE OR RATHER GOOD EVENING THE SUN IS SCARCE
SET I HOPE YOU SLEPT WELL
I STARTED BUT WAS ONLY DISCOMPOSED A MOMENT I KNEW THE VOICE AND
SPEAKER
SLEPT MONSIEUR WHEN WHERE
YOU MAY WELL INQUIRE WHEN WHERE
IT SEEMS YOU TURN DAY INTO NIGHT
AND CHOOSE A DESK FOR A PILLOW RATHER HARD LODGING
IT WAS SOFTENED FOR ME MONSIEUR WHILE I SLEPT
THAT UNSEEN
GIFT BRINGING THING WHICH HAUNTS MY DESK REMEMBERED ME
NO MATTER HOW
I FELL ASLEEP I AWOKE PILLOWED AND COVERED
DID THE SHAWLS KEEP YOU WARM
VERY WARM
DO YOU ASK THANKS FOR THEM
NO
YOU LOOKED PALE IN YOUR SLUMBERS ARE YOU HOME SICK
TO BE HOME SICK ONE MUST HAVE A HOME WHICH I HAVE NOT
THEN YOU HAVE MORE NEED OF A CAREFUL FRIEND
I SCARCELY KNOW ANY ONE
MISS LUCY WHO NEEDS A FRIEND MORE ABSOLUTELY THAN YOU YOUR VERY
FAULTS IMPERATIVELY REQUIRE IT
YOU WANT SO MUCH CHECKING REGULATING
AND KEEPING DOWN
THIS IDEA OF KEEPING DOWN NEVER LEFT M
PAUL'S HEAD THE MOST
HABITUAL SUBJUGATION WOULD IN MY CASE HAVE FAILED TO RELIEVE HIM OF
IT
NO MATTER WHAT DID IT SIGNIFY I LISTENED TO HIM AND DID NOT
TROUBLE MYSELF TO BE TOO SUBMISSIVE HIS OCCUPATION WOULD HAVE BEEN
GONE HAD I LEFT HIM NOTHING TO KEEP DOWN
YOU NEED WATCHING AND WATCHING OVER HE PURSUED AND IT IS WELL FOR
YOU THAT I SEE THIS AND DO MY BEST TO DISCHARGE BOTH DUTIES
I WATCH
YOU AND OTHERS PRETTY CLOSELY PRETTY CONSTANTLY NEARER AND OFTENER
THAN YOU OR THEY THINK
DO YOU SEE THAT WINDOW WITH A LIGHT IN IT
HE POINTED TO A LATTICE IN ONE OF THE COLLEGE BOARDING HOUSES
THAT SAID HE IS A ROOM I HAVE HIRED NOMINALLY FOR A
STUDY VIRTUALLY FOR A POST OF OBSERVATION
THERE I SIT AND READ FOR
HOURS TOGETHER IT IS MY WAY MY TASTE
MY BOOK IS THIS GARDEN ITS
CONTENTS ARE HUMAN NATURE FEMALE HUMAN NATURE
I KNOW YOU ALL BY
HEART
AH I KNOW YOU WELL ST
PIERRE THE PARISIENNE CETTE
MATRESSE FEMME MY COUSIN BECK HERSELF
IT IS NOT RIGHT MONSIEUR
COMMENT IT IS NOT RIGHT BY WHOSE CREED DOES SOME DOGMA OF CALVIN OR
LUTHER CONDEMN IT WHAT IS THAT TO ME I AM NO PROTESTANT
MY RICH
FATHER FOR THOUGH I HAVE KNOWN POVERTY AND ONCE STARVED FOR A YEAR
IN A GARRET IN ROME STARVED WRETCHEDLY OFTEN ON A MEAL A DAY AND
SOMETIMES NOT THAT YET I WAS BORN TO WEALTH MY RICH FATHER WAS A
GOOD CATHOLIC AND HE GAVE ME A PRIEST AND A JESUIT FOR A TUTOR
I
RETAIN HIS LESSONS AND TO WHAT DISCOVERIES GRAND DIEU HAVE THEY NOT
AIDED ME
DISCOVERIES MADE BY STEALTH SEEM TO ME DISHONOURABLE DISCOVERIES
PURITAINE I DOUBT IT NOT
YET SEE HOW MY JESUIT'S SYSTEM WORKS
YOU
KNOW THE ST
PIERRE
PARTIALLY
HE LAUGHED
YOU SAY RIGHT 'PARTIALLY' WHEREAS I KNOW HER
THOROUGHLY THERE IS THE DIFFERENCE
SHE PLAYED BEFORE ME THE
AMIABLE OFFERED ME PATTE DE VELOURS CARESSED FLATTERED FAWNED ON
ME
NOW I AM ACCESSIBLE TO A WOMAN'S FLATTERY ACCESSIBLE AGAINST MY
REASON
THOUGH NEVER PRETTY SHE WAS WHEN I FIRST KNEW HER YOUNG OR
KNEW HOW TO LOOK YOUNG
LIKE ALL HER COUNTRYWOMEN SHE HAD THE ART OF
DRESSING SHE HAD A CERTAIN COOL EASY SOCIAL ASSURANCE WHICH SPARED
ME THE PAIN OF EMBARRASSMENT
MONSIEUR THAT MUST HAVE BEEN UNNECESSARY
I NEVER SAW YOU EMBARRASSED
IN MY LIFE
MADEMOISELLE YOU KNOW LITTLE OF ME I CAN BE EMBARRASSED AS A PETITE
PENSIONNAIRE THERE IS A FUND OF MODESTY AND DIFFIDENCE IN MY NATURE
MONSIEUR I NEVER SAW IT
MADEMOISELLE IT IS THERE
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN IT
MONSIEUR I HAVE OBSERVED YOU IN PUBLIC ON PLATFORMS IN TRIBUNES
BEFORE TITLES AND CROWNED HEADS AND YOU WERE AS EASY AS YOU ARE IN THE
THIRD DIVISION
MADEMOISELLE NEITHER TITLES NOR CROWNED HEADS EXCITE MY MODESTY AND
PUBLICITY IS VERY MUCH MY ELEMENT
I LIKE IT WELL AND BREATHE IN IT
QUITE FREELY BUT BUT IN SHORT HERE IS THE SENTIMENT BROUGHT INTO
ACTION AT THIS VERY MOMENT HOWEVER I DISDAIN TO BE WORSTED BY IT
IF MADEMOISELLE I WERE A MARRYING MAN WHICH I AM NOT AND YOU MAY
SPARE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF ANY SNEER YOU MAY BE CONTEMPLATING AT THE
THOUGHT AND FOUND IT NECESSARY TO ASK A LADY WHETHER SHE COULD LOOK
UPON ME IN THE LIGHT OF A FUTURE HUSBAND THEN WOULD IT BE PROVED THAT
I AM AS I SAY MODEST
I QUITE BELIEVED HIM NOW AND IN BELIEVING I HONOURED HIM WITH A
SINCERITY OF ESTEEM WHICH MADE MY HEART ACHE
AS TO THE ST
PIERRE HE WENT ON RECOVERING HIMSELF FOR HIS VOICE
HAD ALTERED A LITTLE SHE ONCE INTENDED TO BE MADAME EMANUEL AND I
DON'T KNOW WHITHER I MIGHT HAVE BEEN LED BUT FOR YONDER LITTLE LATTICE
WITH THE LIGHT
AH MAGIC LATTICE WHAT MIRACLES OF DISCOVERY HAST THOU
WROUGHT YES HE PURSUED I HAVE SEEN HER RANCOURS HER VANITIES HER
LEVITIES NOT ONLY HERE BUT ELSEWHERE I HAVE WITNESSED WHAT BUCKLERS
ME AGAINST ALL HER ARTS I AM SAFE FROM POOR ZLIE
AND MY PUPILS HE PRESENTLY RECOMMENCED THOSE BLONDES JEUNES
FILLES SO MILD AND MEEK I HAVE SEEN THE MOST RESERVED ROMP LIKE
BOYS THE DEMUREST SNATCH GRAPES FROM THE WALLS SHAKE PEARS FROM THE
TREES
WHEN THE ENGLISH TEACHER CAME I SAW HER MARKED HER EARLY
PREFERENCE FOR THIS ALLEY NOTICED HER TASTE FOR SECLUSION WATCHED HER
WELL LONG BEFORE SHE AND I CAME TO SPEAKING TERMS DO YOU RECOLLECT MY
ONCE COMING SILENTLY AND OFFERING YOU A LITTLE KNOT OF WHITE VIOLETS
WHEN WE WERE STRANGERS
I RECOLLECT IT
I DRIED THE VIOLETS KEPT THEM AND HAVE THEM STILL
IT PLEASED ME WHEN YOU TOOK THEM PEACEFULLY AND PROMPTLY WITHOUT
PRUDERY THAT SENTIMENT WHICH I EVER DREAD TO EXCITE AND WHICH WHEN
IT IS REVEALED IN EYE OR GESTURE I VINDICTIVELY DETEST
TO RETURN
NOT
ONLY DID I WATCH YOU BUT OFTEN ESPECIALLY AT EVENTIDE ANOTHER
GUARDIAN ANGEL WAS NOISELESSLY HOVERING NEAR NIGHT AFTER NIGHT MY
COUSIN BECK HAS STOLEN DOWN YONDER STEPS AND GLIDINGLY PURSUED YOUR
MOVEMENTS WHEN YOU DID NOT SEE HER
BUT MONSIEUR YOU COULD NOT FROM THE DISTANCE OF THAT WINDOW SEE WHAT
PASSED IN THIS GARDEN AT NIGHT
BY MOONLIGHT I POSSIBLY MIGHT WITH A GLASS I USE A GLASS BUT THE
GARDEN ITSELF IS OPEN TO ME
IN THE SHED AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS A
DOOR LEADING INTO A COURT WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE COLLEGE OF THAT
DOOR I POSSESS THE KEY AND THUS COME AND GO AT PLEASURE
THIS
AFTERNOON I CAME THROUGH IT AND FOUND YOU ASLEEP IN CLASSE AGAIN THIS
EVENING I HAVE AVAILED MYSELF OF THE SAME ENTRANCE
I COULD NOT HELP SAYING IF YOU WERE A WICKED DESIGNING MAN HOW
TERRIBLE WOULD ALL THIS BE
HIS ATTENTION SEEMED INCAPABLE OF BEING ARRESTED BY THIS VIEW OF THE
SUBJECT HE LIT HIS CIGAR AND WHILE HE PUFFED IT LEANING AGAINST A
TREE AND LOOKING AT ME IN A COOL AMUSED WAY HE HAD WHEN HIS HUMOUR
WAS TRANQUIL I THOUGHT PROPER TO GO ON SERMONIZING HIM HE OFTEN
LECTURED ME BY THE HOUR TOGETHER I DID NOT SEE WHY I SHOULD NOT SPEAK
MY MIND FOR ONCE
SO I TOLD HIM MY IMPRESSIONS CONCERNING HIS
JESUIT SYSTEM
THE KNOWLEDGE IT BRINGS YOU IS BOUGHT TOO DEAR MONSIEUR THIS COMING
AND GOING BY STEALTH DEGRADES YOUR OWN DIGNITY
MY DIGNITY HE CRIED LAUGHING WHEN DID YOU EVER SEE ME TROUBLE MY
HEAD ABOUT MY DIGNITY IT IS YOU MISS LUCY WHO ARE 'DIGNE HOW
OFTEN IN YOUR HIGH INSULAR PRESENCE HAVE I TAKEN A PLEASURE IN
TRAMPLING UPON WHAT YOU ARE PLEASED TO CALL MY DIGNITY TEARING IT
SCATTERING IT TO THE WINDS IN THOSE MAD TRANSPORTS YOU WITNESS WITH
SUCH HAUTEUR AND WHICH I KNOW YOU THINK VERY LIKE THE RAVINGS OF A
THIRD RATE LONDON ACTOR
MONSIEUR I TELL YOU EVERY GLANCE YOU CAST FROM THAT LATTICE IS A
WRONG DONE TO THE BEST PART OF YOUR OWN NATURE
TO STUDY THE HUMAN
HEART THUS IS TO BANQUET SECRETLY AND SACRILEGIOUSLY ON EVE'S APPLES
I WISH YOU WERE A PROTESTANT
INDIFFERENT TO THE WISH HE SMOKED ON
AFTER A SPACE OF SMILING YET
THOUGHTFUL SILENCE HE SAID RATHER SUDDENLY I HAVE SEEN OTHER
THINGS
WHAT OTHER THINGS
TAKING THE WEED FROM HIS LIPS HE THREW THE REMNANT AMONGST THE SHRUBS
WHERE FOR A MOMENT IT LAY GLOWING IN THE GLOOM
LOOK AT IT SAID HE IS NOT THAT SPARK LIKE AN EYE WATCHING YOU AND
ME
HE TOOK A TURN DOWN THE WALK PRESENTLY RETURNING HE WENT ON I HAVE
SEEN MISS LUCY THINGS TO ME UNACCOUNTABLE THAT HAVE MADE ME WATCH
ALL NIGHT FOR A SOLUTION AND I HAVE NOT YET FOUND IT
THE TONE WAS PECULIAR MY VEINS THRILLED HE SAW ME SHIVER
ARE YOU AFRAID WHETHER IS IT OF MY WORDS OR THAT RED JEALOUS EYE JUST
WINKING ITSELF OUT
I AM COLD THE NIGHT GROWS DARK AND LATE AND THE AIR IS CHANGED IT
IS TIME TO GO IN
IT IS LITTLE PAST EIGHT BUT YOU SHALL GO IN SOON
ANSWER ME ONLY THIS
QUESTION
YET HE PAUSED ERE HE PUT IT
THE GARDEN WAS TRULY GROWING DARK DUSK
HAD COME ON WITH CLOUDS AND DROPS OF RAIN BEGAN TO PATTER THROUGH THE
TREES
I HOPED HE WOULD FEEL THIS BUT FOR THE MOMENT HE SEEMED TOO
MUCH ABSORBED TO BE SENSIBLE OF THE CHANGE
MADEMOISELLE DO YOU PROTESTANTS BELIEVE IN THE SUPERNATURAL
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF THEORY AND BELIEF ON THIS POINT AMONGST
PROTESTANTS AS AMONGST OTHER SECTS I ANSWERED
WHY MONSIEUR DO YOU
ASK SUCH A QUESTION
WHY DO YOU SHRINK AND SPEAK SO FAINTLY ARE YOU SUPERSTITIOUS
I AM CONSTITUTIONALLY NERVOUS
I DISLIKE THE DISCUSSION OF SUCH
SUBJECTS
I DISLIKE IT THE MORE BECAUSE
YOU BELIEVE
NO BUT IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME TO EXPERIENCE IMPRESSIONS
SINCE YOU CAME HERE
YES NOT MANY MONTHS AGO
HERE IN THIS HOUSE
YES
BON I AM GLAD OF IT
I KNEW IT SOMEHOW BEFORE YOU TOLD ME
I WAS
CONSCIOUS OF RAPPORT BETWEEN YOU AND MYSELF
YOU ARE PATIENT AND I AM
CHOLERIC YOU ARE QUIET AND PALE AND I AM TANNED AND FIERY YOU ARE A
STRICT PROTESTANT AND I AM A SORT OF LAY JESUIT BUT WE ARE
ALIKE THERE IS AFFINITY BETWEEN US
DO YOU SEE IT MADEMOISELLE WHEN
YOU LOOK IN THE GLASS DO YOU OBSERVE THAT YOUR FOREHEAD IS SHAPED LIKE
MINE THAT YOUR EYES ARE CUT LIKE MINE DO YOU HEAR THAT YOU HAVE SOME
OF MY TONES OF VOICE DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE MANY OF MY LOOKS I
PERCEIVE ALL THIS AND BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE BORN UNDER MY STAR
YES
YOU WERE BORN UNDER MY STAR TREMBLE FOR WHERE THAT IS THE CASE WITH
MORTALS THE THREADS OF THEIR DESTINIES ARE DIFFICULT TO DISENTANGLE
KNOTTINGS AND CATCHINGS OCCUR SUDDEN BREAKS LEAVE DAMAGE IN THE WEB
BUT THESE 'IMPRESSIONS AS YOU SAY WITH ENGLISH CAUTION
I TOO HAVE
HAD MY 'IMPRESSIONS
MONSIEUR TELL ME THEM
I DESIRE NO BETTER AND INTEND NO LESS
YOU KNOW THE LEGEND OF THIS
HOUSE AND GARDEN
I KNOW IT
YES
THEY SAY THAT HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO A NUN WAS BURIED
HERE ALIVE AT THE FOOT OF THIS VERY TREE BENEATH THE GROUND WHICH NOW
BEARS US
AND THAT IN FORMER DAYS A NUN'S GHOST USED TO COME AND GO HERE
MONSIEUR WHAT IF IT COMES AND GOES HERE STILL
SOMETHING COMES AND GOES HERE THERE IS A SHAPE FREQUENTING THIS HOUSE
BY NIGHT DIFFERENT TO ANY FORMS THAT SHOW THEMSELVES BY DAY
I HAVE
INDISPUTABLY SEEN A SOMETHING MORE THAN ONCE AND TO ME ITS CONVENTUAL
WEEDS WERE A STRANGE SIGHT SAYING MORE THAN THEY CAN DO TO ANY OTHER
LIVING BEING
A NUN
MONSIEUR I TOO HAVE SEEN IT
I ANTICIPATED THAT
WHETHER THIS NUN BE FLESH AND BLOOD OR SOMETHING
THAT REMAINS WHEN BLOOD IS DRIED AND FLESH IS WASTED HER BUSINESS IS
AS MUCH WITH YOU AS WITH ME PROBABLY
WELL I MEAN TO MAKE IT OUT IT
HAS BAFFLED ME SO FAR BUT I MEAN TO FOLLOW UP THE MYSTERY
I MEAN
INSTEAD OF TELLING WHAT HE MEANT HE RAISED HIS HEAD SUDDENLY I MADE
THE SAME MOVEMENT IN THE SAME INSTANT WE BOTH LOOKED TO ONE POINT THE
HIGH TREE SHADOWING THE GREAT BERCEAU AND RESTING SOME OF ITS BOUGHS
ON THE ROOF OF THE FIRST CLASSE
THERE HAD BEEN A STRANGE AND
INEXPLICABLE SOUND FROM THAT QUARTER AS IF THE ARMS OF THAT TREE HAD
SWAYED OF THEIR OWN MOTION AND ITS WEIGHT OF FOLIAGE HAD RUSHED AND
CRUSHED AGAINST THE MASSIVE TRUNK
YES THERE SCARCE STIRRED A BREEZE
AND THAT HEAVY TREE WAS CONVULSED WHILST THE FEATHERY SHRUBS STOOD
STILL
FOR SOME MINUTES AMONGST THE WOOD AND LEAFAGE A RENDING AND
HEAVING WENT ON
DARK AS IT WAS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SOMETHING MORE
SOLID THAN EITHER NIGHT SHADOW OR BRANCH SHADOW BLACKENED OUT OF THE
BOLES
AT LAST THE STRUGGLE CEASED
WHAT BIRTH SUCCEEDED THIS TRAVAIL
WHAT DRYAD WAS BORN OF THESE THROES WE WATCHED FIXEDLY
A SUDDEN BELL
RANG IN THE HOUSE THE PRAYER BELL
INSTANTLY INTO OUR ALLEY THERE
CAME OUT OF THE BERCEAU AN APPARITION ALL BLACK AND WHITE
WITH A
SORT OF ANGRY RUSH CLOSE CLOSE PAST OUR FACES SWEPT SWIFTLY THE VERY
NUN HERSELF NEVER HAD I SEEN HER SO CLEARLY
SHE LOOKED TALL OF
STATURE AND FIERCE OF GESTURE
AS SHE WENT THE WIND ROSE SOBBING THE
RAIN POURED WILD AND COLD THE WHOLE NIGHT SEEMED TO FEEL HER
CHAPTER XXXII
THE FIRST LETTER
WHERE IT BECOMES TIME TO INQUIRE WAS PAULINA MARY HOW FARED MY
INTERCOURSE WITH THE SUMPTUOUS HTEL CRCY THAT INTERCOURSE HAD FOR
AN INTERVAL BEEN SUSPENDED BY ABSENCE M
AND MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE HAD
BEEN TRAVELLING DIVIDING SOME WEEKS BETWEEN THE PROVINCES AND CAPITAL
OF FRANCE
CHANCE APPRISED ME OF THEIR RETURN VERY SHORTLY AFTER IT
TOOK PLACE
I WAS WALKING ONE MILD AFTERNOON ON A QUIET BOULEVARD WANDERING SLOWLY
ON ENJOYING THE BENIGN APRIL SUN AND SOME THOUGHTS NOT UNPLEASING
WHEN I SAW BEFORE ME A GROUP OF RIDERS STOPPING AS IF THEY HAD JUST
ENCOUNTERED AND EXCHANGING GREETINGS IN THE MIDST OF THE BROAD
SMOOTH LINDEN BORDERED PATH ON ONE SIDE A MIDDLE AGED GENTLEMAN AND
YOUNG LADY ON THE OTHER A YOUNG AND HANDSOME MAN
VERY GRACEFUL WAS
THE LADY'S MIEN CHOICE HER APPOINTMENTS DELICATE AND STATELY HER
WHOLE ASPECT
STILL AS I LOOKED I FELT THEY WERE KNOWN TO ME AND
DRAWING A LITTLE NEARER I FULLY RECOGNISED THEM ALL THE COUNT HOME DE
BASSOMPIERRE HIS DAUGHTER AND DR
GRAHAM BRETTON
HOW ANIMATED WAS GRAHAM'S FACE HOW TRUE HOW WARM YET HOW RETIRING
THE JOY IT EXPRESSED THIS WAS THE STATE OF THINGS THIS THE
COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES AT ONCE TO ATTRACT AND ENCHAIN TO SUBDUE
AND EXCITE DR
JOHN
THE PEARL HE ADMIRED WAS IN ITSELF OF GREAT PRICE
AND TRUEST PURITY BUT HE WAS NOT THE MAN WHO IN APPRECIATING THE GEM
COULD FORGET ITS SETTING
HAD HE SEEN PAULINA WITH THE SAME YOUTH
BEAUTY AND GRACE BUT ON FOOT ALONE UNGUARDED AND IN SIMPLE ATTIRE
A DEPENDENT WORKER A DEMI GRISETTE HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER A PRETTY
LITTLE CREATURE AND WOULD HAVE LOVED WITH HIS EYE HER MOVEMENTS AND
HER MIEN BUT IT REQUIRED OTHER THAN THIS TO CONQUER HIM AS HE WAS NOW
VANQUISHED TO BRING HIM SAFE UNDER DOMINION AS NOW WITHOUT LOSS AND
EVEN WITH GAIN TO HIS MANLY HONOUR ONE SAW THAT HE WAS REDUCED THERE
WAS ABOUT DR
JOHN ALL THE MAN OF THE WORLD TO SATISFY HIMSELF DID NOT
SUFFICE SOCIETY MUST APPROVE THE WORLD MUST ADMIRE WHAT HE DID OR HE
COUNTED HIS MEASURES FALSE AND FUTILE
IN HIS VICTRIX HE REQUIRED ALL
THAT WAS HERE VISIBLE THE IMPRINT OF HIGH CULTIVATION THE
CONSECRATION OF A CAREFUL AND AUTHORITATIVE PROTECTION THE ADJUNCTS
THAT FASHION DECREES WEALTH PURCHASES AND TASTE ADJUSTS FOR THESE
CONDITIONS HIS SPIRIT STIPULATED ERE IT SURRENDERED THEY WERE HERE TO
THE UTMOST FULFILLED AND NOW PROUD IMPASSIONED YET FEARING HE DID
HOMAGE TO PAULINA AS HIS SOVEREIGN
AS FOR HER THE SMILE OF FEELING
RATHER THAN OF CONSCIOUS POWER SLEPT SOFT IN HER EYES
THEY PARTED
HE PASSED ME AT SPEED HARDLY FEELING THE EARTH HE
SKIMMED AND SEEING NOTHING ON EITHER HAND
HE LOOKED VERY HANDSOME
METTLE AND PURPOSE WERE ROUSED IN HIM FULLY
PAPA THERE IS LUCY CRIED A MUSICAL FRIENDLY VOICE
LUCY DEAR
LUCY DO COME HERE
I HASTENED TO HER
SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND STOOPED FROM HER SADDLE
TO KISS ME
I WAS COMING TO SEE YOU TO MORROW SAID SHE BUT NOW TO MORROW YOU
WILL COME AND SEE ME
SHE NAMED THE HOUR AND I PROMISED COMPLIANCE
THE MORROW'S EVENING FOUND ME WITH HER SHE AND I SHUT INTO HER OWN
ROOM
I HAD NOT SEEN HER SINCE THAT OCCASION WHEN HER CLAIMS WERE
BROUGHT INTO COMPARISON WITH THOSE OF GINEVRA FANSHAWE AND HAD SO
SIGNALLY PREVAILED SHE HAD MUCH TO TELL ME OF HER TRAVELS IN THE
INTERVAL
A MOST ANIMATED RAPID SPEAKER WAS SHE IN SUCH A TTE TTE
A MOST LIVELY DESCRIBER YET WITH HER ARTLESS DICTION AND CLEAR SOFT
VOICE SHE NEVER SEEMED TO SPEAK TOO FAST OR TO SAY TOO MUCH
MY OWN
ATTENTION I THINK WOULD NOT SOON HAVE FLAGGED BUT BY AND BY SHE
HERSELF SEEMED TO NEED SOME CHANGE OF SUBJECT SHE HASTENED TO WIND UP
HER NARRATIVE BRIEFLY
YET WHY SHE TERMINATED WITH SO CONCISE AN
ABRIDGMENT DID NOT IMMEDIATELY APPEAR SILENCE FOLLOWED A RESTLESS
SILENCE NOT WITHOUT SYMPTOMS OF ABSTRACTION
THEN TURNING TO ME IN A
DIFFIDENT HALF APPEALING VOICE LUCY
WELL I AM AT YOUR SIDE
IS MY COUSIN GINEVRA STILL AT MADAME BECK'S
YOUR COUSIN IS STILL THERE YOU MUST BE LONGING TO SEE HER
NO NOT MUCH
YOU WANT TO INVITE HER TO SPEND ANOTHER EVENING
NO
I SUPPOSE SHE STILL TALKS ABOUT BEING MARRIED
NOT TO ANY ONE YOU CARE FOR
BUT OF COURSE SHE STILL THINKS OF DR
BRETTON SHE CANNOT HAVE CHANGED
HER MIND ON THAT POINT BECAUSE IT WAS SO FIXED TWO MONTHS AGO
WHY YOU KNOW IT DOES NOT MATTER
YOU SAW THE TERMS ON WHICH THEY
STOOD
THERE WAS A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING THAT EVENING CERTAINLY DOES SHE
SEEM UNHAPPY
NOT SHE
TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
HAVE YOU HEARD OR SEEN NOTHING OF OR
FROM
GRAHAM DURING YOUR ABSENCE
PAPA HAD LETTERS FROM HIM ONCE OR TWICE ABOUT BUSINESS I THINK
HE
UNDERTOOK THE MANAGEMENT OF SOME AFFAIR WHICH REQUIRED ATTENTION WHILE
WE WERE AWAY
DR
BRETTON SEEMS TO RESPECT PAPA AND TO HAVE PLEASURE
IN OBLIGING HIM
YES YOU MET HIM YESTERDAY ON THE BOULEVARD YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO
JUDGE FROM HIS ASPECT THAT HIS FRIENDS NEED NOT BE PAINFULLY ANXIOUS
ABOUT HIS HEALTH
PAPA SEEMS TO HAVE THOUGHT WITH YOU
I COULD NOT HELP SMILING
HE IS
NOT PARTICULARLY OBSERVANT YOU KNOW BECAUSE HE IS OFTEN THINKING OF
OTHER THINGS THAN WHAT PASS BEFORE HIS EYES BUT HE SAID AS DR
BRETTON RODE AWAY REALLY IT DOES A MAN GOOD TO SEE THE SPIRIT AND
ENERGY OF THAT BOY HE CALLED DR
BRETTON A BOY I BELIEVE HE ALMOST
THINKS HIM SO JUST AS HE THINKS ME A LITTLE GIRL HE WAS NOT SPEAKING
TO ME BUT DROPPED THAT REMARK TO HIMSELF
LUCY
AGAIN FELL THE APPEALING ACCENT AND AT THE SAME INSTANT SHE LEFT HER
CHAIR AND CAME AND SAT ON THE STOOL AT MY FEET
I LIKED HER
IT IS NOT A DECLARATION I HAVE OFTEN MADE CONCERNING MY
ACQUAINTANCE IN THE COURSE OF THIS BOOK THE READER WILL BEAR WITH IT
FOR ONCE
INTIMATE INTERCOURSE CLOSE INSPECTION DISCLOSED IN PAULINA
ONLY WHAT WAS DELICATE INTELLIGENT AND SINCERE THEREFORE MY REGARD
FOR HER LAY DEEP
AN ADMIRATION MORE SUPERFICIAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE
DEMONSTRATIVE MINE HOWEVER WAS QUIET
WHAT HAVE YOU TO ASK OF LUCY SAID I BE BRAVE AND SPEAK OUT
BUT THERE WAS NO COURAGE IN HER EYE AS IT MET MINE IT FELL AND THERE
WAS NO COOLNESS ON HER CHEEK NOT A TRANSIENT SURFACE BLUSH BUT A
GATHERING INWARD EXCITEMENT RAISED ITS TINT AND ITS TEMPERATURE
LUCY I DO WISH TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS OF DR
BRETTON
DO DO GIVE
ME YOUR REAL OPINION OF HIS CHARACTER HIS DISPOSITION
HIS CHARACTER STANDS HIGH AND DESERVEDLY HIGH
AND HIS DISPOSITION TELL ME ABOUT HIS DISPOSITION SHE URGED YOU
KNOW HIM WELL
I KNOW HIM PRETTY WELL
YOU KNOW HIS HOME SIDE
YOU HAVE SEEN HIM WITH HIS MOTHER SPEAK OF
HIM AS A SON
HE IS A FINE HEARTED SON HIS MOTHER'S COMFORT AND HOPE HER PRIDE AND
PLEASURE
SHE HELD MY HAND BETWEEN HERS AND AT EACH FAVOURABLE WORD GAVE IT A
LITTLE CARESSING STROKE
IN WHAT OTHER WAY IS HE GOOD LUCY
DR
BRETTON IS BENEVOLENT HUMANELY DISPOSED TOWARDS ALL HIS RACE DR
BRETTON WOULD HAVE BENIGNITY FOR THE LOWEST SAVAGE OR THE WORST
CRIMINAL
I HEARD SOME GENTLEMEN SOME OF PAPA'S FRIENDS WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT
HIM SAY THE SAME
THEY SAY MANY OF THE POOR PATIENTS AT THE HOSPITALS
WHO TREMBLE BEFORE SOME PITILESS AND SELFISH SURGEONS WELCOME HIM
THEY ARE RIGHT I HAVE WITNESSED AS MUCH
HE ONCE TOOK ME OVER A
HOSPITAL I SAW HOW HE WAS RECEIVED YOUR FATHER'S FRIENDS ARE RIGHT
THE SOFTEST GRATITUDE ANIMATED HER EYE AS SHE LIFTED IT A MOMENT
SHE
HAD YET MORE TO SAY BUT SEEMED HESITATING ABOUT TIME AND PLACE
DUSK
WAS BEGINNING TO REIGN HER PARLOUR FIRE ALREADY GLOWED WITH TWILIGHT
RUDDINESS BUT I THOUGHT SHE WISHED THE ROOM DIMMER THE HOUR LATER
HOW QUIET AND SECLUDED WE FEEL HERE I REMARKED TO REASSURE HER
DO WE YES IT IS A STILL EVENING AND I SHALL NOT BE CALLED DOWN TO
TEA PAPA IS DINING OUT
STILL HOLDING MY HAND SHE PLAYED WITH THE FINGERS UNCONSCIOUSLY
DRESSED THEM NOW IN HER OWN RINGS AND NOW CIRCLED THEM WITH A TWINE
OF HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR SHE PATTED THE PALM AGAINST HER HOT CHEEK AND
AT LAST HAVING CLEARED A VOICE THAT WAS NATURALLY LIQUID AS A LARK'S
SHE SAID
YOU MUST THINK IT RATHER STRANGE THAT I SHOULD TALK SO MUCH ABOUT DR
BRETTON ASK SO MANY QUESTIONS TAKE SUCH AN INTEREST BUT
NOT AT ALL STRANGE PERFECTLY NATURAL YOU LIKE HIM
AND IF I DID SAID SHE WITH SLIGHT QUICKNESS IS THAT A REASON WHY
I SHOULD TALK I SUPPOSE YOU THINK ME WEAK LIKE MY COUSIN GINEVRA
IF I THOUGHT YOU ONE WHIT LIKE MADAME GINEVRA I WOULD NOT SIT HERE
WAITING FOR YOUR COMMUNICATIONS
I WOULD GET UP WALK AT MY EASE ABOUT
THE ROOM AND ANTICIPATE ALL YOU HAD TO SAY BY A ROUND LECTURE
GO ON
I MEAN TO GO ON RETORTED SHE WHAT ELSE DO YOU SUPPOSE I MEAN TO
DO
AND SHE LOOKED AND SPOKE THE LITTLE POLLY OF BRETTON PETULANT
SENSITIVE
IF SAID SHE EMPHATICALLY IF I LIKED DR
JOHN TILL I WAS FIT TO
DIE FOR LIKING HIM THAT ALONE COULD NOT LICENSE ME TO BE OTHERWISE
THAN DUMB DUMB AS THE GRAVE DUMB AS YOU LUCY SNOWE YOU KNOW IT AND
YOU KNOW YOU WOULD DESPISE ME IF I FAILED IN SELF CONTROL AND WHINED
ABOUT SOME RICKETY LIKING THAT WAS ALL ON MY SIDE
IT IS TRUE I LITTLE RESPECT WOMEN OR GIRLS WHO ARE LOQUACIOUS EITHER
IN BOASTING THE TRIUMPHS OR BEMOANING THE MORTIFICATIONS OF FEELINGS
BUT AS TO YOU PAULINA SPEAK FOR I EARNESTLY WISH TO HEAR YOU
TELL
ME ALL IT WILL GIVE YOU PLEASURE OR RELIEF TO TELL I ASK NO MORE
DO YOU CARE FOR ME LUCY
YES I DO PAULINA
AND I LOVE YOU
I HAD AN ODD CONTENT IN BEING WITH YOU EVEN WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE TROUBLESOME DISOBEDIENT GIRL IT WAS CHARMING TO ME THEN TO
LAVISH ON YOU MY NAUGHTINESS AND WHIMS
NOW YOU ARE ACCEPTABLE TO ME
AND I LIKE TO TALK WITH AND TRUST YOU
SO LISTEN LUCY
AND SHE SETTLED HERSELF RESTING AGAINST MY ARM RESTING GENTLY NOT
WITH HONEST MISTRESS FANSHAWE'S FATIGUING AND SELFISH WEIGHT
A FEW MINUTES SINCE YOU ASKED WHETHER WE HAD NOT HEARD FROM GRAHAM
DURING OUR ABSENCE AND I SAID THERE WERE TWO LETTERS FOR PAPA ON
BUSINESS THIS WAS TRUE BUT I DID NOT TELL YOU ALL
YOU EVADED
I SHUFFLED AND EQUIVOCATED YOU KNOW
HOWEVER I AM GOING TO SPEAK THE
TRUTH NOW IT IS GETTING DARKER ONE CAN TALK AT ONE'S EASE
PAPA OFTEN
LETS ME OPEN THE LETTER BAG AND GIVE HIM OUT THE CONTENTS
ONE MORNING
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SURPRISED I WAS TO FIND
AMONGST A DOZEN LETTERS FOR M
DE BASSOMPIERRE A NOTE ADDRESSED TO
MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE
I SPIED IT AT ONCE AMIDST ALL THE REST THE
HANDWRITING WAS NOT STRANGE IT ATTRACTED ME DIRECTLY
I WAS GOING TO
SAY 'PAPA HERE IS ANOTHER LETTER FROM DR
BRETTON BUT THE 'MISS'
STRUCK ME MUTE
I ACTUALLY NEVER RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A GENTLEMAN
BEFORE
OUGHT I TO HAVE SHOWN IT TO PAPA AND LET HIM OPEN IT AND READ
IT FIRST I COULD NOT FOR MY LIFE LUCY
I KNOW SO WELL PAPA'S IDEAS
ABOUT ME HE FORGETS MY AGE HE THINKS I AM A MERE SCHOOL GIRL HE IS
NOT AWARE THAT OTHER PEOPLE SEE I AM GROWN UP AS TALL AS I SHALL BE
SO WITH A CURIOUS MIXTURE OF FEELINGS SOME OF THEM SELF REPROACHFUL
AND SOME SO FLUTTERING AND STRONG I CANNOT DESCRIBE THEM I GAVE PAPA
HIS TWELVE LETTERS HIS HERD OF POSSESSIONS AND KEPT BACK MY ONE MY
EWE LAMB
IT LAY IN MY LAP DURING BREAKFAST LOOKING UP AT ME WITH AN
INEXPLICABLE MEANING MAKING ME FEEL MYSELF A THING DOUBLE EXISTENT A
CHILD TO THAT DEAR PAPA BUT NO MORE A CHILD TO MYSELF
AFTER BREAKFAST
I CARRIED MY LETTER UP STAIRS AND HAVING SECURED MYSELF BY TURNING THE
KEY IN THE DOOR I BEGAN TO STUDY THE OUTSIDE OF MY TREASURE IT WAS
SOME MINUTES BEFORE I COULD GET OVER THE DIRECTION AND PENETRATE THE
SEAL ONE DOES NOT TAKE A STRONG PLACE OF THIS KIND BY INSTANT
STORM ONE SITS DOWN AWHILE BEFORE IT AS BELEAGUERS SAY
GRAHAM'S HAND
IS LIKE HIMSELF LUCY AND SO IS HIS SEAL ALL CLEAR FIRM AND
ROUNDED NO SLOVENLY SPLASH OF WAX A FULL SOLID STEADY DROP A
DISTINCT IMPRESS NO POINTED TURNS HARSHLY PRICKING THE OPTIC NERVE
BUT A CLEAN MELLOW PLEASANT MANUSCRIPT THAT SOOTHES YOU AS YOU READ
IT IS LIKE HIS FACE JUST LIKE THE CHISELLING OF HIS FEATURES DO YOU
KNOW HIS AUTOGRAPH
I HAVE SEEN IT GO ON
THE SEAL WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO BE BROKEN SO I CUT IT ROUND WITH MY
SCISSORS
ON THE POINT OF READING THE LETTER AT LAST I ONCE MORE DREW
BACK VOLUNTARILY IT WAS TOO SOON YET TO DRINK THAT DRAUGHT THE
SPARKLE IN THE CUP WAS SO BEAUTIFUL I WOULD WATCH IT YET A MINUTE
THEN I REMEMBERED ALL AT ONCE THAT I HAD NOT SAID MY PRAYERS THAT
MORNING
HAVING HEARD PAPA GO DOWN TO BREAKFAST A LITTLE EARLIER THAN
USUAL I HAD BEEN AFRAID OF KEEPING HIM WAITING AND HAD HASTENED TO
JOIN HIM AS SOON AS DRESSED THINKING NO HARM TO PUT OFF PRAYERS TILL
AFTERWARDS
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY I OUGHT TO HAVE SERVED GOD FIRST AND
THEN MAN BUT I DON'T THINK HEAVEN COULD BE JEALOUS OF ANYTHING I MIGHT
DO FOR PAPA
I BELIEVE I AM SUPERSTITIOUS
A VOICE SEEMED NOW TO SAY
THAT ANOTHER FEELING THAN FILIAL AFFECTION WAS IN QUESTION TO URGE ME
TO PRAY BEFORE I DARED TO READ WHAT I SO LONGED TO READ TO DENY MYSELF
YET A MOMENT AND REMEMBER FIRST A GREAT DUTY
I HAVE HAD THESE
IMPULSES EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER
I PUT THE LETTER DOWN AND SAID MY
PRAYERS ADDING AT THE END A STRONG ENTREATY THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED
I MIGHT NOT BE TEMPTED OR LED TO CAUSE PAPA ANY SORROW AND MIGHT
NEVER IN CARING FOR OTHERS NEGLECT HIM
THE VERY THOUGHT OF SUCH A
POSSIBILITY SO PIERCED MY HEART THAT IT MADE ME CRY
BUT STILL LUCY
I FELT THAT IN TIME PAPA WOULD HAVE TO BE TAUGHT THE TRUTH MANAGED
AND INDUCED TO HEAR REASON
I READ THE LETTER
LUCY LIFE IS SAID TO BE ALL DISAPPOINTMENT
I
WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED
ERE I READ AND WHILE I READ MY HEART DID MORE
THAN THROB IT TREMBLED FAST EVERY QUIVER SEEMED LIKE THE PANT OF AN
ANIMAL ATHIRST LAID DOWN AT A WELL AND DRINKING AND THE WELL PROVED
QUITE FULL GLORIOUSLY CLEAR IT ROSE UP MUNIFICENTLY OF ITS OWN
IMPULSE I SAW THE SUN THROUGH ITS GUSH AND NOT A MOTE LUCY NO MOSS
NO INSECT NO ATOM IN THE THRICE REFINED GOLDEN GURGLE
LIFE SHE WENT ON IS SAID TO BE FULL OF PAIN TO SOME
I HAVE READ
BIOGRAPHIES WHERE THE WAYFARER SEEMED TO JOURNEY ON FROM SUFFERING TO
SUFFERING WHERE HOPE FLEW BEFORE HIM FAST NEVER ALIGHTING SO NEAR OR
LINGERING SO LONG AS TO GIVE HIS HAND A CHANCE OF ONE REALIZING GRASP
I HAVE READ OF THOSE WHO SOWED IN TEARS AND WHOSE HARVEST SO FAR FROM
BEING REAPED IN JOY PERISHED BY UNTIMELY BLIGHT OR WAS BORNE OFF BY
SUDDEN WHIRLWIND AND ALAS SOME OF THESE MET THE WINTER WITH EMPTY
GARNERS AND DIED OF UTTER WANT IN THE DARKEST AND COLDEST OF THE YEAR
WAS IT THEIR FAULT PAULINA THAT THEY OF WHOM YOU SPEAK THUS DIED
NOT ALWAYS THEIR FAULT
SOME OF THEM WERE GOOD ENDEAVOURING PEOPLE
I
AM NOT ENDEAVOURING NOR ACTIVELY GOOD YET GOD HAS CAUSED ME TO GROW
IN SUN DUE MOISTURE AND SAFE PROTECTION SHELTERED FOSTERED TAUGHT
BY MY DEAR FATHER AND NOW NOW ANOTHER COMES
GRAHAM LOVES ME
FOR SOME MINUTES WE BOTH PAUSED ON THIS CLIMAX
DOES YOUR FATHER KNOW I INQUIRED IN A LOW VOICE
GRAHAM SPOKE WITH DEEP RESPECT OF PAPA BUT IMPLIED THAT HE DARED NOT
APPROACH THAT QUARTER AS YET HE MUST FIRST PROVE HIS WORTH HE ADDED
THAT HE MUST HAVE SOME LIGHT RESPECTING MYSELF AND MY OWN FEELINGS ERE
HE VENTURED TO RISK A STEP IN THE MATTER ELSEWHERE
HOW DID YOU REPLY
I REPLIED BRIEFLY BUT I DID NOT REPULSE HIM
YET I ALMOST TREMBLED
FOR FEAR OF MAKING THE ANSWER TOO CORDIAL GRAHAM'S TASTES ARE SO
FASTIDIOUS
I WROTE IT THREE TIMES CHASTENING AND SUBDUING THE PHRASES
AT EVERY RESCRIPT AT LAST HAVING CONFECTED IT TILL IT SEEMED TO ME TO
RESEMBLE A MORSEL OF ICE FLAVOURED WITH EVER SO SLIGHT A ZEST OF FRUIT
OR SUGAR I VENTURED TO SEAL AND DESPATCH IT
EXCELLENT PAULINA YOUR INSTINCT IS FINE YOU UNDERSTAND DR
BRETTON
BUT HOW MUST I MANAGE ABOUT PAPA THERE I AM STILL IN PAIN
DO NOT MANAGE AT ALL
WAIT NOW
ONLY MAINTAIN NO FURTHER
CORRESPONDENCE TILL YOUR FATHER KNOWS ALL AND GIVES HIS SANCTION
WILL HE EVER GIVE IT
TIME WILL SHOW
WAIT
DR
BRETTON WROTE ONE OTHER LETTER DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR MY CALM BRIEF
NOTE BUT I ANTICIPATED YOUR ADVICE BY SAYING THAT WHILE MY
SENTIMENTS CONTINUED THE SAME I COULD NOT WITHOUT MY FATHERS
KNOWLEDGE WRITE AGAIN
YOU ACTED AS YOU OUGHT TO HAVE DONE SO DR
BRETTON WILL FEEL IT WILL
INCREASE HIS PRIDE IN YOU HIS LOVE FOR YOU IF EITHER BE CAPABLE OF
INCREASE
PAULINA THAT GENTLE HOAR FROST OF YOURS SURROUNDING SO MUCH
PURE FINE FLAME IS A PRICELESS PRIVILEGE OF NATURE
YOU SEE I FEEL GRAHAM'S DISPOSITION SAID SHE
I FEEL THAT NO
DELICACY CAN BE TOO EXQUISITE FOR HIS TREATMENT
IT IS PERFECTLY PROVED THAT YOU COMPREHEND HIM AND THEN WHATEVER DR
BRETTON'S DISPOSITION WERE HE ONE WHO EXPECTED TO BE MORE NEARLY
MET YOU WOULD STILL ACT TRUTHFULLY OPENLY TENDERLY WITH YOUR
FATHER
LUCY I TRUST I SHALL THUS ACT ALWAYS
OH IT WILL BE PAIN TO WAKE
PAPA FROM HIS DREAM AND TELL HIM I AM NO MORE A LITTLE GIRL
BE IN NO HURRY TO DO SO PAULINA
LEAVE THE REVELATION TO TIME AND
YOUR KIND FATE
I ALSO HAVE NOTICED THE GENTLENESS OF HER CARES FOR
YOU DOUBT NOT SHE WILL BENIGNANTLY ORDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FITLY
APPOINT THE HOUR
YES I HAVE THOUGHT OVER YOUR LIFE JUST AS YOU HAVE
YOURSELF THOUGHT IT OVER I HAVE MADE COMPARISONS LIKE THOSE TO WHICH
YOU ADVERTED
WE KNOW NOT THE FUTURE BUT THE PAST HAS BEEN PROPITIOUS
AS A CHILD I FEARED FOR YOU NOTHING THAT HAS LIFE WAS EVER MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE THAN YOUR NATURE IN INFANCY UNDER HARSHNESS OR NEGLECT
NEITHER YOUR OUTWARD NOR YOUR INWARD SELF WOULD HAVE RIPENED TO WHAT
THEY NOW ARE
MUCH PAIN MUCH FEAR MUCH STRUGGLE WOULD HAVE TROUBLED
THE VERY LINES OF YOUR FEATURES BROKEN THEIR REGULARITY WOULD HAVE
HARASSED YOUR NERVES INTO THE FEVER OF HABITUAL IRRITATION YOU WOULD
HAVE LOST IN HEALTH AND CHEERFULNESS IN GRACE AND SWEETNESS
PROVIDENCE HAS PROTECTED AND CULTURED YOU NOT ONLY FOR YOUR OWN SAKE
BUT I BELIEVE FOR GRAHAM'S
HIS STAR TOO WAS FORTUNATE TO DEVELOP
FULLY THE BEST OF HIS NATURE A COMPANION LIKE YOU WAS NEEDED THERE
YOU ARE READY
YOU MUST BE UNITED
I KNEW IT THE FIRST DAY I SAW YOU
TOGETHER AT LA TERRASSE
IN ALL THAT MUTUALLY CONCERNS YOU AND GRAHAM
THERE SEEMS TO ME PROMISE PLAN HARMONY
I DO NOT THINK THE SUNNY
YOUTH OF EITHER WILL PROVE THE FORERUNNER OF STORMY AGE
I THINK IT IS
DEEMED GOOD THAT YOU TWO SHOULD LIVE IN PEACE AND BE HAPPY NOT AS
ANGELS BUT AS FEW ARE HAPPY AMONGST MORTALS
SOME LIVES ARE THUS
BLESSED IT IS GOD'S WILL IT IS THE ATTESTING TRACE AND LINGERING
EVIDENCE OF EDEN
OTHER LIVES RUN FROM THE FIRST ANOTHER COURSE
OTHER
TRAVELLERS ENCOUNTER WEATHER FITFUL AND GUSTY WILD AND
VARIABLE BREAST ADVERSE WINDS ARE BELATED AND OVERTAKEN BY THE EARLY
CLOSING WINTER NIGHT
NEITHER CAN THIS HAPPEN WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF
GOD AND I KNOW THAT AMIDST HIS BOUNDLESS WORKS IS SOMEWHERE STORED
THE SECRET OF THIS LAST FATE'S JUSTICE I KNOW THAT HIS TREASURES
CONTAIN THE PROOF AS THE PROMISE OF ITS MERCY
CHAPTER XXXIII
M
PAUL KEEPS HIS PROMISE
ON THE FIRST OF MAY WE HAD ALL I E
THE TWENTY BOARDERS AND THE FOUR
TEACHERS NOTICE TO RISE AT FIVE O'CLOCK OF THE MORNING TO BE DRESSED
AND READY BY SIX TO PUT OURSELVES UNDER THE COMMAND OF M
LE
PROFESSEUR EMANUEL WHO WAS TO HEAD OUR MARCH FORTH FROM VILLETTE FOR
IT WAS ON THIS DAY HE PROPOSED TO FULFIL HIS PROMISE OF TAKING US TO
BREAKFAST IN THE COUNTRY
I INDEED AS THE READER MAY PERHAPS
REMEMBER HAD NOT HAD THE HONOUR OF AN INVITATION WHEN THIS EXCURSION
WAS FIRST PROJECTED RATHER THE CONTRARY BUT ON MY NOW MAKING ALLUSION
TO THIS FACT AND WISHING TO KNOW HOW IT WAS TO BE MY EAR RECEIVED A
PULL OF WHICH I DID NOT VENTURE TO CHALLENGE THE REPETITION BY
RAISING FURTHER DIFFICULTIES
JE VOUS CONSEILLE DE VOUS FAIRE PRIER SAID M
EMANUEL IMPERIALLY
MENACING THE OTHER EAR
ONE NAPOLEONIC COMPLIMENT HOWEVER WAS ENOUGH
SO I MADE UP MY MIND TO BE OF THE PARTY
THE MORNING BROKE CALM AS SUMMER WITH SINGING OF BIRDS IN THE GARDEN
AND A LIGHT DEW MIST THAT PROMISED HEAT
WE ALL SAID IT WOULD BE WARM
AND WE ALL FELT PLEASURE IN FOLDING AWAY HEAVY GARMENTS AND IN
ASSUMING THE ATTIRE SUITING A SUNNY SEASON
THE CLEAN FRESH PRINT
DRESS AND THE LIGHT STRAW BONNET EACH MADE AND TRIMMED AS THE FRENCH
WORKWOMAN ALONE CAN MAKE AND TRIM SO AS TO UNITE THE UTTERLY
UNPRETENDING WITH THE PERFECTLY BECOMING WAS THE RULE OF COSTUME
NOBODY FLAUNTED IN FADED SILK NOBODY WORE A SECOND HAND BEST ARTICLE
AT SIX THE BELL RANG MERRILY AND WE POURED DOWN THE STAIRCASE THROUGH
THE CARR ALONG THE CORRIDOR INTO THE VESTIBULE
THERE STOOD OUR
PROFESSOR WEARING NOT HIS SAVAGE LOOKING PALETT AND SEVERE
BONNET GREC BUT A YOUNG LOOKING BELTED BLOUSE AND CHEERFUL STRAW HAT
HE HAD FOR US ALL THE KINDEST GOOD MORROW AND MOST OF US FOR HIM HAD A
THANKSGIVING SMILE
WE WERE MARSHALLED IN ORDER AND SOON STARTED
THE STREETS WERE YET QUIET AND THE BOULEVARDS WERE FRESH AND PEACEFUL
AS FIELDS
I BELIEVE WE WERE VERY HAPPY AS WE WALKED ALONG
THIS CHIEF
OF OURS HAD THE SECRET OF GIVING A CERTAIN IMPETUS TO HAPPINESS WHEN HE
WOULD JUST AS IN AN OPPOSITE MOOD HE COULD GIVE A THRILL TO FEAR
HE DID NOT LEAD NOR FOLLOW US BUT WALKED ALONG THE LINE GIVING A WORD
TO EVERY ONE TALKING MUCH TO HIS FAVOURITES AND NOT WHOLLY NEGLECTING
EVEN THOSE HE DISLIKED
IT WAS RATHER MY WISH FOR A REASON I HAD TO
KEEP SLIGHTLY ALOOF FROM NOTICE AND BEING PAIRED WITH GINEVRA
FANSHAWE BEARING ON MY ARM THE DEAR PRESSURE OF THAT ANGEL'S NOT
UNSUBSTANTIAL LIMB SHE CONTINUED IN EXCELLENT CASE AND I CAN ASSURE
THE READER IT WAS NO TRIFLING BUSINESS TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF HER
LOVELINESS MANY A TIME IN THE COURSE OF THAT WARM DAY I WISHED TO
GOODNESS THERE HAD BEEN LESS OF THE CHARMING COMMODITY HOWEVER
HAVING HER AS I SAID I TRIED TO MAKE HER USEFUL BY INTERPOSING HER
ALWAYS BETWEEN MYSELF AND M
PAUL SHIFTING MY PLACE ACCORDING AS I
HEARD HIM COMING UP TO THE RIGHT HAND OR THE LEFT
MY PRIVATE MOTIVE
FOR THIS MANOEUVRE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE NEW PRINT
DRESS I WORE BEING PINK IN COLOUR A FACT WHICH UNDER OUR PRESENT
CONVOY MADE ME FEEL SOMETHING AS I HAVE FELT WHEN CLAD IN A SHAWL
WITH A RED BORDER NECESSITATED TO TRAVERSE A MEADOW WHERE PASTURED A
BULL
FOR AWHILE THE SHIFTING SYSTEM TOGETHER WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS IN
THE ARRANGEMENT OF A BLACK SILK SCARF ANSWERED MY PURPOSE BUT
BY AND BY HE FOUND OUT THAT WHETHER HE CAME TO THIS SIDE OR TO THAT
MISS FANSHAWE WAS STILL HIS NEIGHBOUR
THE COURSE OF ACQUAINTANCE
BETWEEN GINEVRA AND HIM HAD NEVER RUN SO SMOOTH THAT HIS TEMPER DID NOT
UNDERGO A CERTAIN CRISPING PROCESS WHENEVER HE HEARD HER ENGLISH
ACCENT NOTHING IN THEIR DISPOSITIONS FITTED THEY JARRED IF THEY CAME
IN CONTACT HE HELD HER EMPTY AND AFFECTED SHE DEEMED HIM BEARISH
MEDDLING REPELLENT
AT LAST WHEN HE HAD CHANGED HIS PLACE FOR ABOUT THE SIXTH TIME
FINDING STILL THE SAME UNTOWARD RESULT TO THE EXPERIMENT HE THRUST HIS
HEAD FORWARD SETTLED HIS EYES ON MINE AND DEMANDED WITH IMPATIENCE
QU'EST CE QUE C'EST VOUS ME JOUEZ DES TOURS
THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF HIS MOUTH HOWEVER ERE WITH HIS
CUSTOMARY QUICKNESS HE SEIZED THE ROOT OF THIS PROCEEDING IN VAIN I
SHOOK OUT THE LONG FRINGE AND SPREAD FORTH THE BROAD END OF MY SCARF
A H H C'EST LA ROBE ROSE BROKE FROM HIS LIPS AFFECTING ME VERY
MUCH LIKE THE SUDDEN AND IRATE LOW OF SOME LORD OF THE MEADOW
IT IS ONLY COTTON I ALLEGED HURRIEDLY AND CHEAPER AND WASHES
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER COLOUR
ET MADEMOISELLE LUCY EST COQUETTE COMME DIX PARISIENNES HE ANSWERED
A T ON JAMAIS VU UNE ANGLAISE PAREILLE
REGARDEZ PLUTT SON CHAPEAU
ET SES GANTS ET SES BRODEQUINS THESE ARTICLES OF DRESS WERE JUST
LIKE WHAT MY COMPANIONS WORE CERTAINLY NOT ONE WHIT SMARTER PERHAPS
RATHER PLAINER THAN MOST BUT MONSIEUR HAD NOW GOT HOLD OF HIS TEXT
AND I BEGAN TO CHAFE UNDER THE EXPECTED SERMON
IT WENT OFF HOWEVER
AS MILDLY AS THE MENACE OF A STORM SOMETIMES PASSES ON A SUMMER DAY
I
GOT BUT ONE FLASH OF SHEET LIGHTNING IN THE SHAPE OF A SINGLE BANTERING
SMILE FROM HIS EYES AND THEN HE SAID COURAGE VRAI DIRE JE NE
SUIS PAS FCH PEUT TRE MME SUIS JE CONTENT QU'ON S'EST FAIT SI
BELLE POUR MA PETITE FTE
MAIS MA ROBE N'EST PAS BELLE MONSIEUR ELLE N'EST QUE PROPRE
J'AIME LA PROPRET SAID HE
IN SHORT HE WAS NOT TO BE DISSATISFIED
THE SUN OF GOOD HUMOUR WAS TO TRIUMPH ON THIS AUSPICIOUS MORNING IT
CONSUMED SCUDDING CLOUDS ERE THEY SULLIED ITS DISK
AND NOW WE WERE IN THE COUNTRY AMONGST WHAT THEY CALLED LES BOIS ET
LES PETITS SENTIERS THESE WOODS AND LANES A MONTH LATER WOULD OFFER
BUT A DUSTY AND DOUBTFUL SECLUSION NOW HOWEVER IN THEIR MAY
GREENNESS AND MORNING REPOSE THEY LOOKED VERY PLEASANT
WE REACHED A CERTAIN WELL PLANTED ROUND IN THE TASTE OF LABASSECOUR
WITH AN ORDERLY CIRCLE OF LIME TREES HERE A HALT WAS CALLED ON THE
GREEN SWELL OF GROUND SURROUNDING THIS WELL WE WERE ORDERED TO BE
SEATED MONSIEUR TAKING HIS PLACE IN OUR MIDST AND SUFFERING US TO
GATHER IN A KNOT ROUND HIM
THOSE WHO LIKED HIM MORE THAN THEY FEARED
CAME CLOSE AND THESE WERE CHIEFLY LITTLE ONES THOSE WHO FEARED MORE
THAN THEY LIKED KEPT SOMEWHAT ALOOF THOSE IN WHOM MUCH AFFECTION HAD
GIVEN EVEN TO WHAT REMAINED OF FEAR A PLEASURABLE ZEST OBSERVED THE
GREATEST DISTANCE
HE BEGAN TO TELL US A STORY
WELL COULD HE NARRATE IN SUCH A DICTION
AS CHILDREN LOVE AND LEARNED MEN EMULATE A DICTION SIMPLE IN ITS
STRENGTH AND STRONG IN ITS SIMPLICITY
THERE WERE BEAUTIFUL TOUCHES IN
THAT LITTLE TALE SWEET GLIMPSES OF FEELING AND HUES OF DESCRIPTION
THAT WHILE I LISTENED SUNK INTO MY MIND AND SINCE HAVE NEVER FADED
HE TINTED A TWILIGHT SCENE I HOLD IT IN MEMORY STILL SUCH A PICTURE I
HAVE NEVER LOOKED ON FROM ARTIST'S PENCIL
I HAVE SAID THAT FOR MYSELF I HAD NO IMPROMPTU FACULTY AND PERHAPS
THAT VERY DEFICIENCY MADE ME MARVEL THE MORE AT ONE WHO POSSESSED IT IN
PERFECTION
M
EMANUEL WAS NOT A MAN TO WRITE BOOKS BUT I HAVE HEARD
HIM LAVISH WITH CARELESS UNCONSCIOUS PRODIGALITY SUCH MENTAL WEALTH
AS BOOKS SELDOM BOAST HIS MIND WAS INDEED MY LIBRARY AND WHENEVER IT
WAS OPENED TO ME I ENTERED BLISS
INTELLECTUALLY IMPERFECT AS I WAS I
COULD READ LITTLE THERE WERE FEW BOUND AND PRINTED VOLUMES THAT DID
NOT WEARY ME WHOSE PERUSAL DID NOT FAG AND BLIND BUT HIS TOMES OF
THOUGHT WERE COLLYRIUM TO THE SPIRIT'S EYES OVER THEIR CONTENTS
INWARD SIGHT GREW CLEAR AND STRONG
I USED TO THINK WHAT A DELIGHT IT
WOULD BE FOR ONE WHO LOVED HIM BETTER THAN HE LOVED HIMSELF TO GATHER
AND STORE UP THOSE HANDFULS OF GOLD DUST SO RECKLESSLY FLUNG TO
HEAVEN'S RECKLESS WINDS
HIS STORY DONE HE APPROACHED THE LITTLE KNOLL WHERE I AND GINEVRA SAT
APART
IN HIS USUAL MODE OF DEMANDING AN OPINION HE HAD NOT RETICENCE
TO WAIT TILL IT WAS VOLUNTARILY OFFERED HE ASKED WERE YOU
INTERESTED
ACCORDING TO MY WONTED UNDEMONSTRATIVE FASHION I SIMPLY
ANSWERED YES
WAS IT GOOD
VERY GOOD
YET I COULD NOT WRITE THAT DOWN SAID HE
WHY NOT MONSIEUR
I HATE THE MECHANICAL LABOUR I HATE TO STOOP AND SIT STILL
I COULD
DICTATE IT THOUGH WITH PLEASURE TO AN AMANUENSIS WHO SUITED ME
WOULD MADEMOISELLE LUCY WRITE FOR ME IF I ASKED HER
MONSIEUR WOULD BE TOO QUICK HE WOULD URGE ME AND BE ANGRY IF MY PEN
DID NOT KEEP PACE WITH HIS LIPS
TRY SOME DAY LET US SEE THE MONSTER I CAN MAKE OF MYSELF UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
BUT JUST NOW THERE IS NO QUESTION OF DICTATION I MEAN
TO MAKE YOU USEFUL IN ANOTHER OFFICE
DO YOU SEE YONDER FARM HOUSE
SURROUNDED WITH TREES YES
THERE WE ARE TO BREAKFAST AND WHILE THE GOOD FERMIRE MAKES THE CAF
AU LAIT IN A CALDRON YOU AND FIVE OTHERS WHOM I SHALL SELECT WILL
SPREAD WITH BUTTER HALF A HUNDRED ROLLS
HAVING FORMED HIS TROOP INTO LINE ONCE MORE HE MARCHED US STRAIGHT ON
THE FARM WHICH ON SEEING OUR FORCE SURRENDERED WITHOUT CAPITULATION
CLEAN KNIVES AND PLATES AND FRESH BUTTER BEING PROVIDED HALF A DOZEN
OF US CHOSEN BY OUR PROFESSOR SET TO WORK UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS TO
PREPARE FOR BREAKFAST A HUGE BASKET OF ROLLS WITH WHICH THE BAKER HAD
BEEN ORDERED TO PROVISION THE FARM IN ANTICIPATION OF OUR COMING
COFFEE AND CHOCOLATE WERE ALREADY MADE HOT CREAM AND NEW LAID EGGS
WERE ADDED TO THE TREAT AND M
EMANUEL ALWAYS GENEROUS WOULD HAVE
GIVEN A LARGE ORDER FOR JAMBON AND CONFITURES IN ADDITION BUT THAT
SOME OF US WHO PRESUMED PERHAPS UPON OUR INFLUENCE INSISTED THAT IT
WOULD BE A MOST RECKLESS WASTE OF VICTUAL
HE RAILED AT US FOR OUR
PAINS TERMING US DES MNAGRES AVARES BUT WE LET HIM TALK AND
MANAGED THE ECONOMY OF THE REPAST OUR OWN WAY
WITH WHAT A PLEASANT COUNTENANCE HE STOOD ON THE FARM KITCHEN HEARTH
LOOKING ON HE WAS A MAN WHOM IT MADE HAPPY TO SEE OTHERS HAPPY HE
LIKED TO HAVE MOVEMENT ANIMATION ABUNDANCE AND ENJOYMENT ROUND HIM
WE ASKED WHERE HE WOULD SIT
HE TOLD US WE KNEW WELL HE WAS OUR SLAVE
AND WE HIS TYRANTS AND THAT HE DARED NOT SO MUCH AS CHOOSE A CHAIR
WITHOUT OUR LEAVE SO WE SET HIM THE FARMER'S GREAT CHAIR AT THE HEAD
OF THE LONG TABLE AND PUT HIM INTO IT
WELL MIGHT WE LIKE HIM WITH ALL HIS PASSIONS AND HURRICANES WHEN HE
COULD BE SO BENIGNANT AND DOCILE AT TIMES AS HE WAS JUST NOW
INDEED
AT THE WORST IT WAS ONLY HIS NERVES THAT WERE IRRITABLE NOT HIS
TEMPER THAT WAS RADICALLY BAD SOOTHE COMPREHEND COMFORT HIM AND HE
WAS A LAMB HE WOULD NOT HARM A FLY
ONLY TO THE VERY STUPID PERVERSE
OR UNSYMPATHIZING WAS HE IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE DANGEROUS
MINDFUL ALWAYS OF HIS RELIGION HE MADE THE YOUNGEST OF THE PARTY SAY A
LITTLE PRAYER BEFORE WE BEGAN BREAKFAST CROSSING HIMSELF AS DEVOTEDLY
AS A WOMAN
I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM PRAY BEFORE OR MAKE THAT PIOUS SIGN
HE DID IT SO SIMPLY WITH SUCH CHILD LIKE FAITH I COULD NOT HELP
SMILING PLEASURABLY AS I WATCHED HIS EYES MET MY SMILE HE JUST
STRETCHED OUT HIS KIND HAND SAYING DONNEZ MOI LA MAIN I SEE WE
WORSHIP THE SAME GOD IN THE SAME SPIRIT THOUGH BY DIFFERENT RITES
MOST OF M
EMANUEL'S BROTHER PROFESSORS WERE EMANCIPATED FREE THINKERS
INFIDELS ATHEISTS AND MANY OF THEM MEN WHOSE LIVES WOULD NOT BEAR
SCRUTINY HE WAS MORE LIKE A KNIGHT OF OLD RELIGIOUS IN HIS WAY AND
OF SPOTLESS FAME
INNOCENT CHILDHOOD BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WERE SAFE AT HIS
SIDE
HE HAD VIVID PASSIONS KEEN FEELINGS BUT HIS PURE HONOUR AND HIS
ARTLESS PIETY WERE THE STRONG CHARM THAT KEPT THE LIONS COUCHANT
THAT BREAKFAST WAS A MERRY MEAL AND THE MERRIMENT WAS NOT MERE VACANT
CLATTER M
PAUL ORIGINATED LED CONTROLLED AND HEIGHTENED IT HIS
SOCIAL LIVELY TEMPER PLAYED UNFETTERED AND UNCLOUDED SURROUNDED ONLY
BY WOMEN AND CHILDREN THERE WAS NOTHING TO CROSS AND THWART HIM HE HAD
HIS OWN WAY AND A PLEASANT WAY IT WAS
THE MEAL OVER THE PARTY WERE FREE TO RUN AND PLAY IN THE MEADOWS A
FEW STAYED TO HELP THE FARMER'S WIFE TO PUT AWAY HER EARTHENWARE
M
PAUL CALLED ME FROM AMONG THESE TO COME OUT AND SIT NEAR HIM UNDER A
TREE WHENCE HE COULD VIEW THE TROOP GAMBOLLING OVER A WIDE
PASTURE AND READ TO HIM WHILST HE TOOK HIS CIGAR
HE SAT ON A RUSTIC
BENCH AND I AT THE TREE ROOT
WHILE I READ A POCKET CLASSIC A
CORNEILLE I DID NOT LIKE IT BUT HE DID FINDING THEREIN BEAUTIES I
NEVER COULD BE BROUGHT TO PERCEIVE HE LISTENED WITH A SWEETNESS OF
CALM THE MORE IMPRESSIVE FROM THE IMPETUOSITY OF HIS GENERAL NATURE
THE DEEPEST HAPPINESS FILLED HIS BLUE EYE AND SMOOTHED HIS BROAD
FOREHEAD
I TOO WAS HAPPY HAPPY WITH THE BRIGHT DAY HAPPIER WITH
HIS PRESENCE HAPPIEST WITH HIS KINDNESS
HE ASKED BY AND BY IF I WOULD NOT RATHER RUN TO MY COMPANIONS THAN
SIT THERE I SAID NO I FELT CONTENT TO BE WHERE HE WAS
HE ASKED
WHETHER IF I WERE HIS SISTER I SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENT TO STAY WITH
A BROTHER SUCH AS HE
I SAID I BELIEVED I SHOULD AND I FELT IT
AGAIN HE INQUIRED WHETHER IF HE WERE TO LEAVE VILLETTE AND GO FAR
AWAY I SHOULD BE SORRY AND I DROPPED CORNEILLE AND MADE NO REPLY
PETITE SOEUR SAID HE HOW LONG COULD YOU REMEMBER ME IF WE WERE
SEPARATED
THAT MONSIEUR I CAN NEVER TELL BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG IT
WILL BE BEFORE I SHALL CEASE TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING EARTHLY
IF I WERE TO GO BEYOND SEAS FOR TWO THREE FIVE YEARS SHOULD YOU
WELCOME ME ON MY RETURN
MONSIEUR HOW COULD I LIVE IN THE INTERVAL
POURTANT J'AI T POUR VOUS BIEN DUR BIEN EXIGEANT
I HID MY FACE WITH THE BOOK FOR IT WAS COVERED WITH TEARS
I ASKED HIM
WHY HE TALKED SO AND HE SAID HE WOULD TALK SO NO MORE AND CHEERED ME
AGAIN WITH THE KINDEST ENCOURAGEMENT
STILL THE GENTLENESS WITH WHICH
HE TREATED ME DURING THE REST OF THE DAY WENT SOMEHOW TO MY HEART
IT
WAS TOO TENDER
IT WAS MOURNFUL
I WOULD RATHER HE HAD BEEN ABRUPT
WHIMSICAL AND IRATE AS WAS HIS WONT
WHEN HOT NOON ARRIVED FOR THE DAY TURNED OUT AS WE HAD ANTICIPATED
GLOWING AS JUNE OUR SHEPHERD COLLECTED HIS SHEEP FROM THE PASTURE AND
PROCEEDED TO LEAD US ALL SOFTLY HOME
BUT WE HAD A WHOLE LEAGUE TO
WALK THUS FAR FROM VILLETTE WAS THE FARM WHERE HE HAD BREAKFASTED THE
CHILDREN ESPECIALLY WERE TIRED WITH THEIR PLAY THE SPIRITS OF MOST
FLAGGED AT THE PROSPECT OF THIS MID DAY WALK OVER CHAUSSES FLINTY
GLARING AND DUSTY
THIS STATE OF THINGS HAD BEEN FORESEEN AND PROVIDED
FOR
JUST BEYOND THE BOUNDARY OF THE FARM WE MET TWO SPACIOUS VEHICLES
COMING TO FETCH US SUCH CONVEYANCES AS ARE HIRED OUT PURPOSELY FOR THE
ACCOMMODATION OF SCHOOL PARTIES HERE WITH GOOD MANAGEMENT ROOM WAS
FOUND FOR ALL AND IN ANOTHER HOUR M
PAUL MADE SAFE CONSIGNMENT OF HIS
CHARGE AT THE RUE FOSSETTE
IT HAD BEEN A PLEASANT DAY IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN PERFECT BUT FOR THE BREATHING OF MELANCHOLY WHICH HAD DIMMED ITS
SUNSHINE A MOMENT
THAT TARNISH WAS RENEWED THE SAME EVENING
JUST ABOUT SUNSET I SAW M
EMANUEL COME OUT OF THE FRONT DOOR
ACCOMPANIED BY MADAME BECK
THEY PACED THE CENTRE ALLEY FOR NEARLY AN
HOUR TALKING EARNESTLY HE LOOKING GRAVE YET RESTLESS SHE WEARING
AN AMAZED EXPOSTULATORY DISSUASIVE AIR
I WONDERED WHAT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION AND WHEN MADAME BECK RE ENTERED
THE HOUSE AS IT DARKENED LEAVING HER KINSMAN PAUL YET LINGERING IN THE
GARDEN I SAID TO MYSELF HE CALLED ME 'PETITE SOEUR' THIS MORNING
IF
HE WERE REALLY MY BROTHER HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO GO TO HIM JUST NOW AND
ASK WHAT IT IS THAT PRESSES ON HIS MIND
SEE HOW HE LEANS AGAINST THAT
TREE WITH HIS ARMS CROSSED AND HIS BROW BENT
HE WANTS CONSOLATION I
KNOW MADAME DOES NOT CONSOLE SHE ONLY REMONSTRATES
WHAT NOW
STARTING FROM QUIESCENCE TO ACTION M
PAUL CAME STRIDING ERECT AND
QUICK DOWN THE GARDEN
THE CARR DOORS WERE YET OPEN I THOUGHT HE WAS
PROBABLY GOING TO WATER THE ORANGE TREES IN THE TUBS AFTER HIS
OCCASIONAL CUSTOM ON REACHING THE COURT HOWEVER HE TOOK AN ABRUPT
TURN AND MADE FOR THE BERCEAU AND THE FIRST CLASSE GLASS DOOR
THERE
IN THAT FIRST CLASSE I WAS THENCE I HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM BUT THERE I
COULD NOT FIND COURAGE TO AWAIT HIS APPROACH
HE HAD TURNED SO
SUDDENLY HE STRODE SO FAST HE LOOKED SO STRANGE THE COWARD WITHIN ME
GREW PALE SHRANK AND NOT WAITING TO LISTEN TO REASON AND HEARING THE
SHRUBS CRUSH AND THE GRAVEL CRUNCH TO HIS ADVANCE SHE WAS GONE ON THE
WINGS OF PANIC
NOR DID I PAUSE TILL I HAD TAKEN SANCTUARY IN THE ORATORY NOW EMPTY
LISTENING THERE WITH BEATING PULSES AND AN UNACCOUNTABLE UNDEFINED
APPREHENSION I HEARD HIM PASS THROUGH ALL THE SCHOOLROOMS CLASHING
THE DOORS IMPATIENTLY AS HE WENT I HEARD HIM INVADE THE REFECTORY
WHICH THE LECTURE PIEUSE WAS NOW HOLDING UNDER HALLOWED CONSTRAINT I
HEARD HIM PRONOUNCE THESE WORDS O EST MADEMOISELLE LUCIE
AND JUST AS SUMMONING MY COURAGE I WAS PREPARING TO GO DOWN AND DO
WHAT AFTER ALL I MOST WISHED TO DO IN THE WORLD VIZ MEET HIM THE
WIRY VOICE OF ST
PIERRE REPLIED GLIBLY AND FALSELY ELLE EST AU LIT
AND HE PASSED WITH THE STAMP OF VEXATION INTO THE CORRIDOR
THERE
MADAME BECK MET CAPTURED CHID CONVOYED TO THE STREET DOOR AND
FINALLY DISMISSED HIM
AS THAT STREET DOOR CLOSED A SUDDEN AMAZEMENT AT MY OWN PERVERSE
PROCEEDING STRUCK LIKE A BLOW UPON ME
I FELT FROM THE FIRST IT WAS ME
HE WANTED ME HE WAS SEEKING AND HAD NOT I WANTED HIM TOO WHAT THEN
HAD CARRIED ME AWAY WHAT HAD RAPT ME BEYOND HIS REACH HE HAD
SOMETHING TO TELL HE WAS GOING TO TELL ME THAT SOMETHING MY EAR
STRAINED ITS NERVE TO HEAR IT AND I HAD MADE THE CONFIDENCE
IMPOSSIBLE
YEARNING TO LISTEN AND CONSOLE WHILE I THOUGHT AUDIENCE
AND SOLACE BEYOND HOPE'S REACH NO SOONER DID OPPORTUNITY SUDDENLY AND
FULLY ARRIVE THAN I EVADED IT AS I WOULD HAVE EVADED THE LEVELLED
SHAFT OF MORTALITY
WELL MY INSANE INCONSISTENCY HAD ITS REWARD
INSTEAD OF THE COMFORT
THE CERTAIN SATISFACTION I MIGHT HAVE WON COULD I BUT HAVE PUT
CHOKING PANIC DOWN AND STOOD FIRM TWO MINUTES HERE WAS DEAD BLANK
DARK DOUBT AND DREAR SUSPENSE
I TOOK MY WAGES TO MY PILLOW AND PASSED THE NIGHT COUNTING THEM
CHAPTER XXXIV
MALEVOLA
MADAME BECK CALLED ME ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND ASKED WHETHER I HAD
ANY OCCUPATION TO HINDER ME FROM GOING INTO TOWN AND EXECUTING SOME
LITTLE COMMISSIONS FOR HER AT THE SHOPS
BEING DISENGAGED AND PLACING MYSELF AT HER SERVICE I WAS PRESENTLY
FURNISHED WITH A LIST OF THE WOOLS SILKS EMBROIDERING THREAD
ETCETERA WANTED IN THE PUPILS' WORK AND HAVING EQUIPPED MYSELF IN A
MANNER SUITING THE THREATENING ASPECT OF A CLOUDY AND SULTRY DAY I WAS
JUST DRAWING THE SPRING BOLT OF THE STREET DOOR IN ACT TO ISSUE FORTH
WHEN MADAME'S VOICE AGAIN SUMMONED ME TO THE SALLE MANGER
PARDON MEESS LUCIE CRIED SHE IN THE SEEMING HASTE OF AN IMPROMPTU
THOUGHT I HAVE JUST RECOLLECTED ONE MORE ERRAND FOR YOU IF YOUR
GOOD NATURE WILL NOT DEEM ITSELF OVER BURDENED
OF COURSE I CONFOUNDED MYSELF IN ASSEVERATIONS TO THE CONTRARY AND
MADAME RUNNING INTO THE LITTLE SALON BROUGHT THENCE A PRETTY BASKET
FILLED WITH FINE HOTHOUSE FRUIT ROSY PERFECT AND TEMPTING REPOSING
AMONGST THE DARK GREEN WAX LIKE LEAVES AND PALE YELLOW STARS OF I
KNOW NOT WHAT EXOTIC PLANT
THERE SHE SAID IT IS NOT HEAVY AND WILL NOT SHAME YOUR NEAT
TOILETTE AS IF IT WERE A HOUSEHOLD SERVANT LIKE DETAIL
DO ME THE
FAVOUR TO LEAVE THIS LITTLE BASKET AT THE HOUSE OF MADAME WALRAVENS
WITH MY FELICITATIONS ON HER FTE
SHE LIVES DOWN IN THE OLD TOWN
NUMRO 3 RUE DES MAGES
I FEAR YOU WILL FIND THE WALK RATHER LONG BUT
YOU HAVE THE WHOLE AFTERNOON BEFORE YOU AND DO NOT HURRY IF YOU ARE
NOT BACK IN TIME FOR DINNER I WILL ORDER A PORTION TO BE SAVED OR
GOTON WITH WHOM YOU ARE A FAVOURITE WILL HAVE PLEASURE IN TOSSING UP
SOME TRIFLE FOR YOUR ESPECIAL BENEFIT
YOU SHALL NOT BE FORGOTTEN MA
BONNE MEESS
AND OH PLEASE CALLING ME BACK ONCE MORE BE SURE TO
INSIST ON SEEING MADAME WALRAVENS HERSELF AND GIVING THE BASKET INTO
HER OWN HANDS IN ORDER THAT THERE MAY BE NO MISTAKE FOR SHE IS RATHER
A PUNCTILIOUS PERSONAGE
ADIEU AU REVOIR
AND AT LAST I GOT AWAY
THE SHOP COMMISSIONS TOOK SOME TIME TO EXECUTE
THAT CHOOSING AND MATCHING OF SILKS AND WOOLS BEING ALWAYS A TEDIOUS
BUSINESS BUT AT LAST I GOT THROUGH MY LIST
THE PATTERNS FOR THE
SLIPPERS THE BELL ROPES THE CABAS WERE SELECTED THE SLIDES AND
TASSELS FOR THE PURSES CHOSEN THE WHOLE TRIPOTAGE IN SHORT WAS OFF
MY MIND NOTHING BUT THE FRUIT AND THE FELICITATIONS REMAINED TO BE
ATTENDED TO
I RATHER LIKED THE PROSPECT OF A LONG WALK DEEP INTO THE OLD AND GRIM
BASSE VILLE AND I LIKED IT NO WORSE BECAUSE THE EVENING SKY OVER THE
CITY WAS SETTLING INTO A MASS OF BLACK BLUE METAL HEATED AT THE RIM
AND INFLAMING SLOWLY TO A HEAVY RED
I FEAR A HIGH WIND BECAUSE STORM DEMANDS THAT EXERTION OF STRENGTH AND
USE OF ACTION I ALWAYS YIELD WITH PAIN BUT THE SULLEN DOWN FALL THE
THICK SNOW DESCENT OR DARK RUSH OF RAIN ASK ONLY RESIGNATION THE
QUIET ABANDONMENT OF GARMENTS AND PERSON TO BE DRENCHED
IN RETURN IT
SWEEPS A GREAT CAPITAL CLEAN BEFORE YOU IT MAKES YOU A QUIET PATH
THROUGH BROAD GRAND STREETS IT PETRIFIES A LIVING CITY AS IF BY
EASTERN ENCHANTMENT IT TRANSFORMS A VILLETTE INTO A TADMOR
LET THEN
THE RAINS FALL AND THE FLOODS DESCEND ONLY I MUST FIRST GET RID OF
THIS BASKET OF FRUIT
AN UNKNOWN CLOCK FROM AN UNKNOWN TOWER JEAN BAPTISTE'S VOICE WAS NOW
TOO DISTANT TO BE AUDIBLE WAS TOLLING THE THIRD QUARTER PAST FIVE
WHEN I REACHED THAT STREET AND HOUSE WHEREOF MADAME BECK HAD GIVEN ME
THE ADDRESS
IT WAS NO STREET AT ALL IT SEEMED RATHER TO BE PART OF A
SQUARE IT WAS QUIET GRASS GREW BETWEEN THE BROAD GREY FLAGS THE
HOUSES WERE LARGE AND LOOKED VERY OLD BEHIND THEM ROSE THE APPEARANCE
OF TREES INDICATING GARDENS AT THE BACK
ANTIQUITY BROODED ABOVE THIS
REGION BUSINESS WAS BANISHED THENCE
RICH MEN HAD ONCE POSSESSED THIS
QUARTER AND ONCE GRANDEUR HAD MADE HER SEAT HERE
THAT CHURCH WHOSE
DARK HALF RUINOUS TURRETS OVERLOOKED THE SQUARE WAS THE VENERABLE AND
FORMERLY OPULENT SHRINE OF THE MAGI
BUT WEALTH AND GREATNESS HAD LONG
SINCE STRETCHED THEIR GILDED PINIONS AND FLED HENCE LEAVING THESE
THEIR ANCIENT NESTS PERHAPS TO HOUSE PENURY FOR A TIME OR PERHAPS TO
STAND COLD AND EMPTY MOULDERING UNTENANTED IN THE COURSE OF WINTERS
AS I CROSSED THIS DESERTED PLACE ON WHOSE PAVEMENT DROPS ALMOST AS
LARGE AS A FIVE FRANC PIECE WERE NOW SLOWLY DARKENING I SAW IN ITS
WHOLE EXPANSE NO SYMPTOM OR EVIDENCE OF LIFE EXCEPT WHAT WAS GIVEN IN
THE FIGURE OF AN INFIRM OLD PRIEST WHO WENT PAST BENDING AND PROPPED
ON A STAFF THE TYPE OF ELD AND DECAY
HE HAD ISSUED FROM THE VERY HOUSE TO WHICH I WAS DIRECTED AND WHEN I
PAUSED BEFORE THE DOOR JUST CLOSED AFTER HIM AND RANG THE BELL HE
TURNED TO LOOK AT ME
NOR DID HE SOON AVERT HIS GAZE PERHAPS HE
THOUGHT ME WITH MY BASKET OF SUMMER FRUIT AND MY LACK OF THE DIGNITY
AGE CONFERS AN INCONGRUOUS FIGURE IN SUCH A SCENE
I KNOW HAD A YOUNG
RUDDY FACED BONNE OPENED THE DOOR TO ADMIT ME I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
SUCH A ONE LITTLE IN HARMONY WITH HER DWELLING BUT WHEN I FOUND
MYSELF CONFRONTED BY A VERY OLD WOMAN WEARING A VERY ANTIQUE PEASANT
COSTUME A CAP ALIKE HIDEOUS AND COSTLY WITH LONG FLAPS OF NATIVE
LACE A PETTICOAT AND JACKET OF CLOTH AND SABOTS MORE LIKE LITTLE
BOATS THAN SHOES IT SEEMED ALL RIGHT AND SOOTHINGLY IN CHARACTER
THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE WAS NOT QUITE SO SOOTHING AS THE CUT OF HER
COSTUME ANYTHING MORE CANTANKEROUS I HAVE SELDOM SEEN SHE WOULD
SCARCELY REPLY TO MY INQUIRY AFTER MADAME WALRAVENS I BELIEVE SHE
WOULD HAVE SNATCHED THE BASKET OF FRUIT FROM MY HAND HAD NOT THE OLD
PRIEST HOBBLING UP CHECKED HER AND HIMSELF LENT AN EAR TO THE
MESSAGE WITH WHICH I WAS CHARGED
HIS APPARENT DEAFNESS RENDERED IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO MAKE HIM FULLY
UNDERSTAND THAT I MUST SEE MADAME WALRAVENS AND CONSIGN THE FRUIT INTO
HER OWN HANDS
AT LAST HOWEVER HE COMPREHENDED THE FACT THAT SUCH
WERE MY ORDERS AND THAT DUTY ENJOINED THEIR LITERAL FULFILMENT
ADDRESSING THE AGED BONNE NOT IN FRENCH BUT IN THE ABORIGINAL TONGUE
OF LABASSECOUR HE PERSUADED HER AT LAST TO LET ME CROSS THE
INHOSPITABLE THRESHOLD AND HIMSELF ESCORTING ME UP STAIRS I WAS
USHERED INTO A SORT OF SALON AND THERE LEFT
THE ROOM WAS LARGE AND HAD A FINE OLD CEILING AND ALMOST CHURCH LIKE
WINDOWS OF COLOURED GLASS BUT IT WAS DESOLATE AND IN THE SHADOW OF A
COMING STORM LOOKED STRANGELY LOWERING
WITHIN OPENED A SMALLER ROOM
THERE HOWEVER THE BLIND OF THE SINGLE CASEMENT WAS CLOSED THROUGH
THE DEEP GLOOM FEW DETAILS OF FURNITURE WERE APPARENT
THESE FEW I
AMUSED MYSELF BY PUZZLING TO MAKE OUT AND IN PARTICULAR I WAS
ATTRACTED BY THE OUTLINE OF A PICTURE ON THE WALL
BY AND BY THE PICTURE SEEMED TO GIVE WAY TO MY BEWILDERMENT IT SHOOK
IT SUNK IT ROLLED BACK INTO NOTHING ITS VANISHING LEFT AN OPENING
ARCHED LEADING INTO AN ARCHED PASSAGE WITH A MYSTIC WINDING STAIR
BOTH PASSAGE AND STAIR WERE OF COLD STONE UNCARPETED AND UNPAINTED
DOWN THIS DONJON STAIR DESCENDED A TAP TAP LIKE A STICK SOON THERE
FELL ON THE STEPS A SHADOW AND LAST OF ALL I WAS AWARE OF A SUBSTANCE
YET WAS IT ACTUAL SUBSTANCE THIS APPEARANCE APPROACHING ME THIS
OBSTRUCTION PARTIALLY DARKENING THE ARCH
IT DREW NEAR AND I SAW IT WELL
I BEGAN TO COMPREHEND WHERE I WAS
WELL MIGHT THIS OLD SQUARE BE NAMED QUARTER OF THE MAGI WELL MIGHT THE
THREE TOWERS OVERLOOKING IT OWN FOR GODFATHERS THREE MYSTIC SAGES OF
A DEAD AND DARK ART
HOAR ENCHANTMENT HERE PREVAILED A SPELL HAD
OPENED FOR ME ELF LAND THAT CELL LIKE ROOM THAT VANISHING PICTURE
THAT ARCH AND PASSAGE AND STAIR OF STONE WERE ALL PARTS OF A FAIRY
TALE
DISTINCTER EVEN THAN THESE SCENIC DETAILS STOOD THE CHIEF
FIGURE CUNEGONDE THE SORCERESS MALEVOLA THE EVIL FAIRY
HOW WAS SHE
SHE MIGHT BE THREE FEET HIGH BUT SHE HAD NO SHAPE HER SKINNY HANDS
RESTED UPON EACH OTHER AND PRESSED THE GOLD KNOB OF A WAND LIKE IVORY
STAFF
HER FACE WAS LARGE SET NOT UPON HER SHOULDERS BUT BEFORE HER
BREAST SHE SEEMED TO HAVE NO NECK I SHOULD HAVE SAID THERE WERE A
HUNDRED YEARS IN HER FEATURES AND MORE PERHAPS IN HER EYES HER
MALIGN UNFRIENDLY EYES WITH THICK GREY BROWS ABOVE AND LIVID LIDS
ALL ROUND
HOW SEVERELY THEY VIEWED ME WITH A SORT OF DULL DISPLEASURE
THIS BEING WORE A GOWN OF BROCADE DYED BRIGHT BLUE FULL TINTED AS THE
GENTIANELLA FLOWER AND COVERED WITH SATIN FOLIAGE IN A LARGE PATTERN
OVER THE GOWN A COSTLY SHAWL GORGEOUSLY BORDERED AND SO LARGE FOR
HER THAT ITS MANY COLOURED FRINGE SWEPT THE FLOOR
BUT HER CHIEF
POINTS WERE HER JEWELS SHE HAD LONG CLEAR EARRINGS BLAZING WITH A
LUSTRE WHICH COULD NOT BE BORROWED OR FALSE SHE HAD RINGS ON HER
SKELETON HANDS WITH THICK GOLD HOOPS AND STONES PURPLE GREEN AND
BLOOD RED
HUNCHBACKED DWARFISH AND DOTING SHE WAS ADORNED LIKE A
BARBARIAN QUEEN
QUE ME VOULEZ VOUS SAID SHE HOARSELY WITH THE VOICE RATHER OF MALE
THAN OF FEMALE OLD AGE AND INDEED A SILVER BEARD BRISTLED HER CHIN
I DELIVERED MY BASKET AND MY MESSAGE
IS THAT ALL SHE DEMANDED
IT IS ALL SAID I
TRULY IT WAS WELL WORTH WHILE SHE ANSWERED
RETURN TO MADAME BECK
AND TELL HER I CAN BUY FRUIT WHEN I WANT IT ET QUANT SES
FLICITATIONS JE M'EN MOQUE AND THIS COURTEOUS DAME TURNED HER BACK
JUST AS SHE TURNED A PEAL OF THUNDER BROKE AND A FLASH OF LIGHTNING
BLAZED BROAD OVER SALON AND BOUDOIR
THE TALE OF MAGIC SEEMED TO
PROCEED WITH DUE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE ELEMENTS
THE WANDERER DECOYED
INTO THE ENCHANTED CASTLE HEARD RISING OUTSIDE THE SPELL WAKENED
TEMPEST
WHAT IN ALL THIS WAS I TO THINK OF MADAME BECK SHE OWNED STRANGE
ACQUAINTANCE SHE OFFERED MESSAGES AND GIFTS AT AN UNIQUE SHRINE AND
INAUSPICIOUS SEEMED THE BEARING OF THE UNCOUTH THING SHE WORSHIPPED
THERE WENT THAT SULLEN SIDONIA TOTTERING AND TREMBLING LIKE PALSY
INCARNATE TAPPING HER IVORY STAFF ON THE MOSAIC PARQUET AND MUTTERING
VENOMOUSLY AS SHE VANISHED
DOWN WASHED THE RAIN DEEP LOWERED THE WELKIN THE CLOUDS RUDDY A
WHILE AGO HAD NOW THROUGH ALL THEIR BLACKNESS TURNED DEADLY PALE AS
IF IN TERROR
NOTWITHSTANDING MY LATE BOAST ABOUT NOT FEARING A SHOWER
I HARDLY LIKED TO GO OUT UNDER THIS WATERSPOUT
THEN THE GLEAMS OF
LIGHTNING WERE VERY FIERCE THE THUNDER CRASHED VERY NEAR THIS STORM
HAD GATHERED IMMEDIATELY ABOVE VILLETTE IT SEEMED TO HAVE BURST AT THE
ZENITH IT RUSHED DOWN PRONE THE FORKED SLANT BOLTS PIERCED ATHWART
VERTICAL TORRENTS RED ZIGZAGS INTERLACED A DESCENT BLANCHED AS WHITE
METAL AND ALL BROKE FROM A SKY HEAVILY BLACK IN ITS SWOLLEN ABUNDANCE
LEAVING MADAME WALRAVENS' INHOSPITABLE SALON I BETOOK MYSELF TO HER
COLD STAIRCASE THERE WAS A SEAT ON THE LANDING THERE I WAITED
SOMEBODY CAME GLIDING ALONG THE GALLERY JUST ABOVE IT WAS THE OLD
PRIEST
INDEED MADEMOISELLE SHALL NOT SIT THERE SAID HE
IT WOULD
DISPLEASURE OUR BENEFACTOR IF HE KNEW A STRANGER WAS SO TREATED IN THIS
HOUSE
AND HE BEGGED ME SO EARNESTLY TO RETURN TO THE SALON THAT WITHOUT
DISCOURTESY I COULD NOT BUT COMPLY
THE SMALLER ROOM WAS BETTER
FURNISHED AND MORE HABITABLE THAN THE LARGER THITHER HE INTRODUCED ME
PARTIALLY WITHDRAWING THE BLIND HE DISCLOSED WHAT SEEMED MORE LIKE AN
ORATORY THAN A BOUDOIR A VERY SOLEMN LITTLE CHAMBER LOOKING AS IF IT
WERE A PLACE RATHER DEDICATED TO RELICS AND REMEMBRANCE THAN DESIGNED
FOR PRESENT USE AND COMFORT
THE GOOD FATHER SAT DOWN AS IF TO KEEP ME COMPANY BUT INSTEAD OF
CONVERSING HE TOOK OUT A BOOK FASTENED ON THE PAGE HIS EYES AND
EMPLOYED HIS LIPS IN WHISPERING WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A PRAYER OR LITANY
A YELLOW ELECTRIC LIGHT FROM THE SKY GILDED HIS BALD HEAD HIS FIGURE
REMAINED IN SHADE DEEP AND PURPLE HE SAT STILL AS SCULPTURE HE
SEEMED TO FORGET ME FOR HIS PRAYERS HE ONLY LOOKED UP WHEN A FIERCER
BOLT OR A HARSHER CLOSER RATTLE TOLD OF NEARING DANGER EVEN THEN IT
WAS NOT IN FEAR BUT IN SEEMING AWE HE RAISED HIS EYES
I TOO WAS
AWE STRUCK BEING HOWEVER UNDER NO PRESSURE OF SLAVISH TERROR MY
THOUGHTS AND OBSERVATIONS WERE FREE
TO SPEAK TRUTH I WAS BEGINNING TO FANCY THAT THE OLD PRIEST RESEMBLED
THAT PRE SILAS BEFORE WHOM I HAD KNEELED IN THE CHURCH OF THE
BGUINAGE
THE IDEA WAS VAGUE FOR I HAD SEEN MY CONFESSOR ONLY IN DUSK
AND IN PROFILE YET STILL I SEEMED TO TRACE A LIKENESS I THOUGHT ALSO
I RECOGNIZED THE VOICE
WHILE I WATCHED HIM HE BETRAYED BY ONE LIFTED
LOOK THAT HE FELT MY SCRUTINY I TURNED TO NOTE THE ROOM THAT TOO HAD
ITS HALF MYSTIC INTEREST
BESIDE A CROSS OF CURIOUSLY CARVED OLD IVORY YELLOW WITH TIME AND
SLOPED ABOVE A DARK RED PRIE DIEU FURNISHED DULY WITH RICH MISSAL
AND EBON ROSARY HUNG THE PICTURE WHOSE DIM OUTLINE HAD DRAWN MY EYES
BEFORE THE PICTURE WHICH MOVED FELL AWAY WITH THE WALL AND LET IN
PHANTOMS
IMPERFECTLY SEEN I HAD TAKEN IT FOR A MADONNA REVEALED BY
CLEARER LIGHT IT PROVED TO BE A WOMAN'S PORTRAIT IN A NUN'S DRESS
THE
FACE THOUGH NOT BEAUTIFUL WAS PLEASING PALE YOUNG AND SHADED WITH
THE DEJECTION OF GRIEF OR ILL HEALTH
I SAY AGAIN IT WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL
IT WAS NOT EVEN INTELLECTUAL ITS VERY AMIABILITY WAS THE AMIABILITY OF
A WEAK FRAME INACTIVE PASSIONS ACQUIESCENT HABITS YET I LOOKED LONG
AT THAT PICTURE AND COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LOOK
THE OLD PRIEST WHO AT FIRST HAD SEEMED TO ME SO DEAF AND INFIRM MUST
YET HAVE RETAINED HIS FACULTIES IN TOLERABLE PRESERVATION ABSORBED IN
HIS BOOK AS HE APPEARED WITHOUT ONCE LIFTING HIS HEAD OR AS FAR AS I
KNEW TURNING HIS EYES HE PERCEIVED THE POINT TOWARDS WHICH MY
ATTENTION WAS DRAWN AND IN A SLOW DISTINCT VOICE DROPPED CONCERNING
IT THESE FOUR OBSERVATIONS
SHE WAS MUCH BELOVED
SHE GAVE HERSELF TO GOD
SHE DIED YOUNG
SHE IS STILL REMEMBERED STILL WEPT
BY THAT AGED LADY MADAME WALRAVENS I INQUIRED FANCYING THAT I HAD
DISCOVERED IN THE INCURABLE GRIEF OF BEREAVEMENT A KEY TO THAT SAME
AGED LADY'S DESPERATE ILL HUMOUR
THE FATHER SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH HALF A SMILE
NO NO SAID HE A GRAND DAME'S AFFECTION FOR HER CHILDREN'S
CHILDREN MAY BE GREAT AND HER SORROW FOR THEIR LOSS LIVELY BUT IT IS
ONLY THE AFFIANCED LOVER TO WHOM FATE FAITH AND DEATH HAVE TREBLY
DENIED THE BLISS OF UNION WHO MOURNS WHAT HE HAS LOST AS JUSTINE
MARIE IS STILL MOURNED
I THOUGHT THE FATHER RATHER WISHED TO BE QUESTIONED AND THEREFORE I
INQUIRED WHO HAD LOST AND WHO STILL MOURNED JUSTINE MARIE I GOT IN
REPLY QUITE A LITTLE ROMANTIC NARRATIVE TOLD NOT UNIMPRESSIVELY WITH
THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE NOW SUBSIDING STORM
I AM BOUND TO SAY IT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE MUCH MORE TRULY IMPRESSIVE IF THERE HAD BEEN LESS
FRENCH ROUSSEAU LIKE SENTIMENTALIZING AND WIRE DRAWING AND RATHER
MORE HEALTHFUL CARELESSNESS OF EFFECT
BUT THE WORTHY FATHER WAS
OBVIOUSLY A FRENCHMAN BORN AND BRED I BECAME MORE AND MORE PERSUADED
OF HIS RESEMBLANCE TO MY CONFESSOR HE WAS A TRUE SON OF ROME WHEN HE
DID LIFT HIS EYES HE LOOKED AT ME OUT OF THEIR CORNERS WITH MORE AND
SHARPER SUBTLETY THAN ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT COULD SURVIVE THE WEAR
AND TEAR OF SEVENTY YEARS
YET I BELIEVE HE WAS A GOOD OLD MAN
THE HERO OF HIS TALE WAS SOME FORMER PUPIL OF HIS WHOM HE NOW CALLED
HIS BENEFACTOR AND WHO IT APPEARS HAD LOVED THIS PALE JUSTINE MARIE
THE DAUGHTER OF RICH PARENTS AT A TIME WHEN HIS OWN WORLDLY PROSPECTS
WERE SUCH AS TO JUSTIFY HIS ASPIRING TO A WELL DOWERED HAND
THE
PUPIL'S FATHER ONCE A RICH BANKER HAD FAILED DIED AND LEFT BEHIND
HIM ONLY DEBTS AND DESTITUTION
THE SON WAS THEN FORBIDDEN TO THINK OF
MARIE ESPECIALLY THAT OLD WITCH OF A GRAND DAME I HAD SEEN MADAME
WALRAVENS OPPOSED THE MATCH WITH ALL THE VIOLENCE OF A TEMPER WHICH
DEFORMITY MADE SOMETIMES DEMONIAC
THE MILD MARIE HAD NEITHER THE
TREACHERY TO BE FALSE NOR THE FORCE TO BE QUITE STAUNCH TO HER LOVER
SHE GAVE UP HER FIRST SUITOR BUT REFUSING TO ACCEPT A SECOND WITH A
HEAVIER PURSE WITHDREW TO A CONVENT AND THERE DIED IN HER NOVICIATE
LASTING ANGUISH IT SEEMS HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE FAITHFUL HEART
WHICH WORSHIPPED HER AND THE TRUTH OF THAT LOVE AND GRIEF HAD BEEN
SHOWN IN A MANNER WHICH TOUCHED EVEN ME AS I LISTENED
SOME YEARS AFTER JUSTINE MARIE'S DEATH RUIN HAD COME ON HER HOUSE TOO
HER FATHER BY NOMINAL CALLING A JEWELLER BUT WHO ALSO DEALT A GOOD
DEAL ON THE BOURSE HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN SOME FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
WHICH ENTAILED EXPOSURE AND RUINOUS FINES
HE DIED OF GRIEF FOR THE
LOSS AND SHAME FOR THE INFAMY
HIS OLD HUNCHBACKED MOTHER AND HIS
BEREAVED WIFE WERE LEFT PENNILESS AND MIGHT HAVE DIED TOO OF WANT BUT
THEIR LOST DAUGHTER'S ONCE DESPISED YET MOST TRUE HEARTED SUITOR
HEARING OF THE CONDITION OF THESE LADIES CAME WITH SINGULAR
DEVOTEDNESS TO THE RESCUE
HE TOOK ON THEIR INSOLENT PRIDE THE REVENGE
OF THE PUREST CHARITY HOUSING CARING FOR BEFRIENDING THEM SO AS NO
SON COULD HAVE DONE IT MORE TENDERLY AND EFFICIENTLY
THE MOTHER ON
THE WHOLE A GOOD WOMAN DIED BLESSING HIM THE STRANGE GODLESS
LOVELESS MISANTHROPE GRANDMOTHER LIVED STILL ENTIRELY SUPPORTED BY
THIS SELF SACRIFICING MAN
HER WHO HAD BEEN THE BANE OF HIS LIFE
BLIGHTING HIS HOPE AND AWARDING HIM FOR LOVE AND DOMESTIC HAPPINESS
LONG MOURNING AND CHEERLESS SOLITUDE HE TREATED WITH THE RESPECT A
GOOD SON MIGHT OFFER A KIND MOTHER
HE HAD BROUGHT HER TO THIS HOUSE
AND CONTINUED THE PRIEST WHILE GENUINE TEARS ROSE TO HIS EYES
HERE TOO HE SHELTERS ME HIS OLD TUTOR AND AGNES A SUPERANNUATED
SERVANT OF HIS FATHER'S FAMILY
TO OUR SUSTENANCE AND TO OTHER
CHARITIES I KNOW HE DEVOTES THREE PARTS OF HIS INCOME KEEPING ONLY
THE FOURTH TO PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH BREAD AND THE MOST MODEST
ACCOMMODATIONS
BY THIS ARRANGEMENT HE HAS RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO
HIMSELF EVER TO MARRY HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF TO GOD AND TO HIS
ANGEL BRIDE AS MUCH AS IF HE WERE A PRIEST LIKE ME
THE FATHER HAD WIPED AWAY HIS TEARS BEFORE HE UTTERED THESE LAST WORDS
AND IN PRONOUNCING THEM HE FOR ONE INSTANT RAISED HIS EYES TO MINE
I
CAUGHT THIS GLANCE DESPITE ITS VEILED CHARACTER THE MOMENTARY GLEAM
SHOT A MEANING WHICH STRUCK ME
THESE ROMANISTS ARE STRANGE BEINGS
SUCH A ONE AMONG THEM WHOM YOU
KNOW NO MORE THAN THE LAST INCA OF PERU OR THE FIRST EMPEROR OF
CHINA KNOWS YOU AND ALL YOUR CONCERNS AND HAS HIS REASONS FOR SAYING
TO YOU SO AND SO WHEN YOU SIMPLY THOUGHT THE COMMUNICATION SPRANG
IMPROMPTU FROM THE INSTANT'S IMPULSE HIS PLAN IN BRINGING IT ABOUT
THAT YOU SHALL COME ON SUCH A DAY TO SUCH A PLACE UNDER SUCH AND SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT SEEMS TO YOUR CRUDE
APPREHENSION THE ORDINANCE OF CHANCE OR THE SEQUEL OF EXIGENCY
MADAME
BECK'S SUDDENLY RECOLLECTED MESSAGE AND PRESENT MY ARTLESS EMBASSY TO
THE PLACE OF THE MAGI THE OLD PRIEST ACCIDENTALLY DESCENDING THE STEPS
AND CROSSING THE SQUARE HIS INTERPOSITION ON MY BEHALF WITH THE BONNE
WHO WOULD HAVE SENT ME AWAY HIS REAPPEARANCE ON THE STAIRCASE MY
INTRODUCTION TO THIS ROOM THE PORTRAIT THE NARRATIVE SO AFFABLY
VOLUNTEERED ALL THESE LITTLE INCIDENTS TAKEN AS THEY FELL OUT SEEMED
EACH INDEPENDENT OF ITS SUCCESSOR A HANDFUL OF LOOSE BEADS BUT
THREADED THROUGH BY THAT QUICK SHOT AND CRAFTY GLANCE OF A JESUIT EYE
THEY DROPPED PENDENT IN A LONG STRING LIKE THAT ROSARY ON THE
PRIE DIEU
WHERE LAY THE LINK OF JUNCTION WHERE THE LITTLE CLASP OF
THIS MONASTIC NECKLACE I SAW OR FELT UNION BUT COULD NOT YET FIND THE
SPOT OR DETECT THE MEANS OF CONNECTION
PERHAPS THE MUSING FIT INTO WHICH I HAD BY THIS TIME FALLEN APPEARED
SOMEWHAT SUSPICIOUS IN ITS ABSTRACTION HE GENTLY INTERRUPTED
MADEMOISELLE SAID HE I TRUST YOU HAVE NOT FAR TO GO THROUGH THESE
INUNDATED STREETS
MORE THAN HALF A LEAGUE
YOU LIVE
IN THE RUE FOSSETTE
NOT WITH ANIMATION NOT AT THE PENSIONNAT OF MADAME BECK
THE SAME
DONC CLAPPING HIS HANDS DONC VOUS DEVEZ CONNATRE MON NOBLE
LVE MON PAUL
MONSIEUR PAUL EMANUEL PROFESSOR OF LITERATURE
HE AND NONE OTHER
A BRIEF SILENCE FELL
THE SPRING OF JUNCTION SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE
BECOME PALPABLE I FELT IT YIELD TO PRESSURE
WAS IT OF M
PAUL YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING I PRESENTLY INQUIRED
WAS
HE YOUR PUPIL AND THE BENEFACTOR OF MADAME WALRAVENS
YES AND OF AGNES THE OLD SERVANT AND MOREOVER WITH A CERTAIN
EMPHASIS HE WAS AND IS THE LOVER TRUE CONSTANT AND ETERNAL OF
THAT SAINT IN HEAVEN JUSTINE MARIE
AND WHO FATHER ARE YOU I CONTINUED AND THOUGH I ACCENTUATED THE
QUESTION ITS UTTERANCE WAS WELL NIGH SUPERFLUOUS I WAS ERE THIS QUITE
PREPARED FOR THE ANSWER WHICH ACTUALLY CAME
I DAUGHTER AM PRE SILAS THAT UNWORTHY SON OF HOLY CHURCH WHOM YOU
ONCE HONOURED WITH A NOBLE AND TOUCHING CONFIDENCE SHOWING ME THE CORE
OF A HEART AND THE INNER SHRINE OF A MIND WHEREOF IN SOLEMN TRUTH I
COVETED THE DIRECTION IN BEHALF OF THE ONLY TRUE FAITH
NOR HAVE I FOR
A DAY LOST SIGHT OF YOU NOR FOR AN HOUR FAILED TO TAKE IN YOU A ROOTED
INTEREST
PASSED UNDER THE DISCIPLINE OF ROME MOULDED BY HER HIGH
TRAINING INOCULATED WITH HER SALUTARY DOCTRINES INSPIRED BY THE ZEAL
SHE ALONE GIVES I REALIZE WHAT THEN MIGHT BE YOUR SPIRITUAL RANK YOUR
PRACTICAL VALUE AND I ENVY HERESY HER PREY
THIS STRUCK ME AS A SPECIAL STATE OF THINGS I HALF REALIZED MYSELF IN
THAT CONDITION ALSO PASSED UNDER DISCIPLINE MOULDED TRAINED
INOCULATED AND SO ON
NOT SO THOUGHT I BUT I RESTRAINED
DEPRECATION AND SAT QUIETLY ENOUGH
I SUPPOSE M
PAUL DOES NOT LIVE HERE I RESUMED PURSUING A THEME
WHICH I THOUGHT MORE TO THE PURPOSE THAN ANY WILD RENEGADE DREAMS
NO HE ONLY COMES OCCASIONALLY TO WORSHIP HIS BELOVED SAINT TO MAKE
HIS CONFESSION TO ME AND TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO HER HE CALLS HIS
MOTHER
HIS OWN LODGING CONSISTS BUT OF TWO ROOMS HE HAS NO SERVANT
AND YET HE WILL NOT SUFFER MADAME WALRAVENS TO DISPOSE OF THOSE
SPLENDID JEWELS WITH WHICH YOU SEE HER ADORNED AND IN WHICH SHE TAKES
A PUERILE PRIDE AS THE ORNAMENTS OF HER YOUTH AND THE LAST RELICS OF
HER SON THE JEWELLER'S WEALTH
HOW OFTEN MURMURED I TO MYSELF HAS THIS MAN THIS M
EMANUEL
SEEMED TO ME TO LACK MAGNANIMITY IN TRIFLES YET HOW GREAT HE IS IN
GREAT THINGS
I OWN I DID NOT RECKON AMONGST THE PROOFS OF HIS GREATNESS EITHER THE
ACT OF CONFESSION OR THE SAINT WORSHIP
HOW LONG IS IT SINCE THAT LADY DIED I INQUIRED LOOKING AT JUSTINE
MARIE
TWENTY YEARS
SHE WAS SOMEWHAT OLDER THAN M
EMANUEL HE WAS THEN VERY
YOUNG FOR HE IS NOT MUCH BEYOND FORTY
DOES HE YET WEEP HER
HIS HEART WILL WEEP HER ALWAYS THE ESSENCE OF EMANUEL'S NATURE
IS CONSTANCY
THIS WAS SAID WITH MARKED EMPHASIS
AND NOW THE SUN BROKE OUT PALLID AND WATERISH THE RAIN YET FELL BUT
THERE WAS NO MORE TEMPEST THAT HOT FIRMAMENT HAD CLOVEN AND POURED OUT
ITS LIGHTNINGS
A LONGER DELAY WOULD SCARCE LEAVE DAYLIGHT FOR MY
RETURN SO I ROSE THANKED THE FATHER FOR HIS HOSPITALITY AND HIS TALE
WAS BENIGNANTLY ANSWERED BY A PAX VOBISCUM WHICH I MADE KINDLY
WELCOME BECAUSE IT SEEMED UTTERED WITH A TRUE BENEVOLENCE BUT I LIKED
LESS THE MYSTIC PHRASE ACCOMPANYING IT
DAUGHTER YOU SHALL BE WHAT YOU SHALL BE AN ORACLE THAT MADE ME
SHRUG MY SHOULDERS AS SOON AS I HAD GOT OUTSIDE THE DOOR
FEW OF US
KNOW WHAT WE ARE TO COME TO CERTAINLY BUT FOR ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
YET I HAD GOOD HOPES OF LIVING AND DYING A SOBER MINDED PROTESTANT
THERE WAS A HOLLOWNESS WITHIN AND A FLOURISH AROUND HOLY CHURCH
WHICH TEMPTED ME BUT MODERATELY
I WENT ON MY WAY PONDERING MANY
THINGS
WHATEVER ROMANISM MAY BE THERE ARE GOOD ROMANISTS THIS MAN
EMANUEL SEEMED OF THE BEST TOUCHED WITH SUPERSTITION INFLUENCED BY
PRIESTCRAFT YET WONDROUS FOR FOND FAITH FOR PIOUS DEVOTION FOR
SACRIFICE OF SELF FOR CHARITY UNBOUNDED
IT REMAINED TO SEE HOW ROME
BY HER AGENTS HANDLED SUCH QUALITIES WHETHER SHE CHERISHED THEM FOR
THEIR OWN SAKE AND FOR GOD'S OR PUT THEM OUT TO USURY AND MADE BOOTY
OF THE INTEREST
BY THE TIME I REACHED HOME IT WAS SUNDOWN
GOTON HAD KINDLY SAVED ME A
PORTION OF DINNER WHICH INDEED I NEEDED
SHE CALLED ME INTO THE LITTLE
CABINET TO PARTAKE OF IT AND THERE MADAME BECK SOON MADE HER
APPEARANCE BRINGING ME A GLASS OF WINE
WELL BEGAN SHE CHUCKLING AND WHAT SORT OF A RECEPTION DID MADAME
WALRAVENS GIVE YOU ELLE EST DRLE N'EST CE PAS
I TOLD HER WHAT HAD PASSED DELIVERING VERBATIM THE COURTEOUS MESSAGE
WITH WHICH I HAD BEEN CHARGED
OH LA SINGULIRE PETITE BOSSUE LAUGHED SHE
ET FIGUREZ VOUS QU'ELLE
ME DTESTE PARCEQU'ELLE ME CROIT AMOUREUSE DE MON COUSIN PAUL CE
PETIT DVOT QUI N'OSE PAS BOUGER MOINS QUE SON CONFESSEUR NE LUI
DONNE LA PERMISSION AU RESTE SHE WENT ON IF HE WANTED TO MARRY
EVER SO MUCH SOIT MOI SOIT UNE AUTRE HE COULD NOT DO IT HE HAS TOO
LARGE A FAMILY ALREADY ON HIS HANDS MRE WALRAVENS PRE SILAS DAME
AGNES AND A WHOLE TROOP OF NAMELESS PAUPERS
THERE NEVER WAS A MAN
LIKE HIM FOR LAYING ON HIMSELF BURDENS GREATER THAN HE CAN BEAR
VOLUNTARILY INCURRING NEEDLESS RESPONSIBILITIES
BESIDES HE HARBOURS A
ROMANTIC IDEA ABOUT SOME PALE FACED MARIE JUSTINE PERSONNAGE ASSEZ
NIAISE CE QUE JE PENSE SUCH WAS MADAME'S IRREVERENT REMARK WHO
HAS BEEN AN ANGEL IN HEAVEN OR ELSEWHERE THIS SCORE OF YEARS AND TO
WHOM HE MEANS TO GO FREE FROM ALL EARTHLY TIES PURE COMME UN LIS
CE QU'IL DIT
OH YOU WOULD LAUGH COULD YOU BUT KNOW HALF M
EMANUEL'S
CROTCHETS AND ECCENTRICITIES BUT I HINDER YOU FROM TAKING REFRESHMENT
MA BONNE MEESS WHICH YOU MUST NEED EAT YOUR SUPPER DRINK YOUR WINE
OUBLIEZ LES ANGES LES BOSSUES ET SURTOUT LES PROFESSEURS ET BON
SOIR
CHAPTER XXXV
FRATERNITY
OUBLIEZ LES PROFESSEURS SO SAID MADAME BECK
MADAME BECK WAS A WISE
WOMAN BUT SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE UTTERED THOSE WORDS
TO DO SO WAS A
MISTAKE
THAT NIGHT SHE SHOULD HAVE LEFT ME CALM NOT EXCITED
INDIFFERENT NOT INTERESTED ISOLATED IN MY OWN ESTIMATION AND THAT OF
OTHERS NOT CONNECTED EVEN IN IDEA WITH THIS SECOND PERSON WHOM I WAS
TO FORGET
FORGET HIM AH THEY TOOK A SAGE PLAN TO MAKE ME FORGET HIM THE
WISEHEADS THEY SHOWED ME HOW GOOD HE WAS THEY MADE OF MY DEAR LITTLE
MAN A STAINLESS LITTLE HERO
AND THEN THEY HAD PRATED ABOUT HIS MANNER
OF LOVING
WHAT MEANS HAD I BEFORE THIS DAY OF BEING CERTAIN WHETHER
HE COULD LOVE AT ALL OR NOT
I HAD KNOWN HIM JEALOUS SUSPICIOUS I HAD SEEN ABOUT HIM CERTAIN
TENDERNESSES FITFULNESSES A SOFTNESS WHICH CAME LIKE A WARM AIR AND
A RUTH WHICH PASSED LIKE EARLY DEW DRIED IN THE HEAT OF HIS
IRRITABILITIES THIS WAS ALL I HAD SEEN
AND THEY PRE SILAS AND
MODESTE MARIA BECK THAT THESE TWO WROUGHT IN CONCERT I COULD NOT
DOUBT OPENED UP THE ADYTUM OF HIS HEART SHOWED ME ONE GRAND LOVE THE
CHILD OF THIS SOUTHERN NATURE'S YOUTH BORN SO STRONG AND PERFECT THAT
IT HAD LAUGHED AT DEATH HIMSELF DESPISED HIS MEAN RAPE OF MATTER
CLUNG TO IMMORTAL SPIRIT AND IN VICTORY AND FAITH HAD WATCHED BESIDE
A TOMB TWENTY YEARS
THIS HAD BEEN DONE NOT IDLY THIS WAS NOT A MERE HOLLOW INDULGENCE OF
SENTIMENT HE HAD PROVEN HIS FIDELITY BY THE CONSECRATION OF HIS BEST
ENERGIES TO AN UNSELFISH PURPOSE AND ATTESTED IT BY LIMITLESS PERSONAL
SACRIFICES FOR THOSE ONCE DEAR TO HER HE PRIZED HE HAD LAID DOWN
VENGEANCE AND TAKEN UP A CROSS
NOW AS FOR JUSTINE MARIE I KNEW WHAT SHE WAS AS WELL AS IF I HAD SEEN
HER
I KNEW SHE WAS WELL ENOUGH THERE WERE GIRLS LIKE HER IN MADAME
BECK'S SCHOOL PHLEGMATICS PALE SLOW INERT BUT KIND NATURED
NEUTRAL OF EVIL UNDISTINGUISHED FOR GOOD
IF SHE WORE ANGELS' WINGS I KNEW WHOSE POET FANCY CONFERRED THEM
IF
HER FOREHEAD SHONE LUMINOUS WITH THE REFLEX OF A HALO I KNEW IN THE
FIRE OF WHOSE IRIDS THAT CIRCLET OF HOLY FLAME HAD GENERATION
WAS I THEN TO BE FRIGHTENED BY JUSTINE MARIE WAS THE PICTURE OF A
PALE DEAD NUN TO RISE AN ETERNAL BARRIER AND WHAT OF THE CHARITIES
WHICH ABSORBED HIS WORLDLY GOODS WHAT OF HIS HEART SWORN TO VIRGINITY
MADAME BECK PRE SILAS YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SUGGESTED THESE QUESTIONS
THEY WERE AT ONCE THE DEEPEST PUZZLE THE STRONGEST OBSTRUCTION AND
THE KEENEST STIMULUS I HAD EVER FELT
FOR A WEEK OF NIGHTS AND DAYS I
FELL ASLEEP I DREAMT AND I WOKE UPON THESE TWO QUESTIONS
IN THE
WHOLE WORLD THERE WAS NO ANSWER TO THEM EXCEPT WHERE ONE DARK LITTLE
MAN STOOD SAT WALKED LECTURED UNDER THE HEAD PIECE OF A BANDIT
BONNET GREC AND WITHIN THE GIRTH OF A SORRY PALETT MUCH BE INKED
AND NO LITTLE ADUST
AFTER THAT VISIT TO THE RUE DES MAGES I DID WANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN
I
FELT AS IF KNOWING WHAT I NOW KNEW HIS COUNTENANCE WOULD OFFER A PAGE
MORE LUCID MORE INTERESTING THAN EVER I FELT A LONGING TO TRACE IN IT
THE IMPRINT OF THAT PRIMITIVE DEVOTEDNESS THE SIGNS OF THAT
HALF KNIGHTLY HALF SAINTLY CHIVALRY WHICH THE PRIEST'S NARRATIVE
IMPUTED TO HIS NATURE
HE HAD BECOME MY CHRISTIAN HERO UNDER THAT
CHARACTER I WANTED TO VIEW HIM
NOR WAS OPPORTUNITY SLOW TO FAVOUR MY NEW IMPRESSIONS UNDERWENT HER
TEST THE NEXT DAY
YES I WAS GRANTED AN INTERVIEW WITH MY CHRISTIAN
HERO AN INTERVIEW NOT VERY HEROIC OR SENTIMENTAL OR BIBLICAL BUT
LIVELY ENOUGH IN ITS WAY
ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK OF THE AFTERNOON THE PEACE OF THE FIRST
CLASSE SAFELY ESTABLISHED AS IT SEEMED UNDER THE SERENE SWAY OF
MADAME BECK WHO IN PROPRI PERSON WAS GIVING ONE OF HER ORDERLY
AND USEFUL LESSONS THIS PEACE I SAY SUFFERED A SUDDEN FRACTURE BY
THE WILD INBURST OF A PALETT
NOBODY AT THE MOMENT WAS QUIETER THAN MYSELF
EASED OF RESPONSIBILITY
BY MADAME BECK'S PRESENCE SOOTHED BY HER UNIFORM TONES PLEASED AND
EDIFIED WITH HER CLEAR EXPOSITION OF THE SUBJECT IN HAND FOR SHE
TAUGHT WELL I SAT BENT OVER MY DESK DRAWING THAT IS COPYING AN
ELABORATE LINE ENGRAVING TEDIOUSLY WORKING UP MY COPY TO THE FINISH OF
THE ORIGINAL FOR THAT WAS MY PRACTICAL NOTION OF ART AND STRANGE TO
SAY I TOOK EXTREME PLEASURE IN THE LABOUR AND COULD EVEN PRODUCE
CURIOUSLY FINICAL CHINESE FACSIMILES OF STEEL OR MEZZOTINT
PLATES THINGS ABOUT AS VALUABLE AS SO MANY ACHIEVEMENTS IN
WORSTED WORK BUT I THOUGHT PRETTY WELL OF THEM IN THOSE DAYS
WHAT WAS THE MATTER MY DRAWING MY PENCILS MY PRECIOUS COPY GATHERED
INTO ONE CRUSHED UP HANDFUL PERISHED FROM BEFORE MY SIGHT I MYSELF
APPEARED TO BE SHAKEN OR EMPTIED OUT OF MY CHAIR AS A SOLITARY AND
WITHERED NUTMEG MIGHT BE EMPTIED OUT OF A SPICE BOX BY AN EXCITED COOK
THAT CHAIR AND MY DESK SEIZED BY THE WILD PALETT ONE UNDER EACH
SLEEVE WERE BORNE AFAR IN A SECOND I FOLLOWED THE FURNITURE IN TWO
MINUTES THEY AND I WERE FIXED IN THE CENTRE OF THE GRAND SALLE A VAST
ADJOINING ROOM SELDOM USED SAVE FOR DANCING AND CHORAL
SINGING LESSONS FIXED WITH AN EMPHASIS WHICH SEEMED TO PROHIBIT THE
REMOTEST HOPE OF OUR EVER BEING PERMITTED TO STIR THENCE AGAIN
HAVING PARTIALLY COLLECTED MY SCARED WITS I FOUND MYSELF IN THE
PRESENCE OF TWO MEN GENTLEMEN I SUPPOSE I SHOULD SAY ONE DARK THE
OTHER LIGHT ONE HAVING A STIFF HALF MILITARY AIR AND WEARING A
BRAIDED SURTOUT THE OTHER PARTAKING IN GARB AND BEARING MORE OF THE
CARELESS ASPECT OF THE STUDENT OR ARTIST CLASS BOTH FLOURISHING IN
FULL MAGNIFICENCE OF MOUSTACHES WHISKERS AND IMPERIAL
M
EMANUEL
STOOD A LITTLE APART FROM THESE HIS COUNTENANCE AND EYES EXPRESSED
STRONG CHOLER HE HELD FORTH HIS HAND WITH HIS TRIBUNE GESTURE
MADEMOISELLE SAID HE YOUR BUSINESS IS TO PROVE TO THESE GENTLEMEN
THAT I AM NO LIAR
YOU WILL ANSWER TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY SUCH
QUESTIONS AS THEY SHALL PUT
YOU WILL ALSO WRITE ON SUCH THEME AS THEY
SHALL SELECT
IN THEIR EYES IT APPEARS I HOLD THE POSITION OF AN
UNPRINCIPLED IMPOSTOR
I WRITE ESSAYS AND WITH DELIBERATE FORGERY
SIGN TO THEM MY PUPILS' NAMES AND BOAST OF THEM AS THEIR WORK
YOU
WILL DISPROVE THIS CHARGE
GRAND CIEL HERE WAS THE SHOW TRIAL SO LONG EVADED COME ON ME LIKE A
THUNDER CLAP
THESE TWO FINE BRAIDED MUSTACHIOED SNEERING
PERSONAGES WERE NONE OTHER THAN DANDY PROFESSORS OF THE
COLLEGE MESSIEURS BOISSEC AND ROCHEMORTE A PAIR OF COLD BLOODED FOPS
AND PEDANTS SCEPTICS AND SCOFFERS
IT SEEMS THAT M
PAUL HAD BEEN
RASHLY EXHIBITING SOMETHING I HAD WRITTEN SOMETHING HE HAD NEVER ONCE
PRAISED OR EVEN MENTIONED IN MY HEARING AND WHICH I DEEMED
FORGOTTEN
THE ESSAY WAS NOT REMARKABLE AT ALL IT ONLY SEEMED
REMARKABLE COMPARED WITH THE AVERAGE PRODUCTIONS OF FOREIGN
SCHOOL GIRLS IN AN ENGLISH ESTABLISHMENT IT WOULD HAVE PASSED SCARCE
NOTICED
MESSIEURS BOISSEC AND ROCHEMORTE HAD THOUGHT PROPER TO
QUESTION ITS GENUINENESS AND INSINUATE A CHEAT I WAS NOW TO BEAR MY
TESTIMONY TO THE TRUTH AND TO BE PUT TO THE TORTURE OF THEIR
EXAMINATION
A MEMORABLE SCENE ENSUED
THEY BEGAN WITH CLASSICS
A DEAD BLANK
THEY WENT ON TO FRENCH HISTORY
I HARDLY KNEW MROVE FROM PHARAMOND
THEY TRIED ME IN VARIOUS
'OLOGIES AND STILL ONLY GOT A SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND AN UNCHANGING JE
N'EN SAIS RIEN
AFTER AN EXPRESSIVE PAUSE THEY PROCEEDED TO MATTERS OF GENERAL
INFORMATION BROACHING ONE OR TWO SUBJECTS WHICH I KNEW PRETTY WELL
AND ON WHICH I HAD OFTEN REFLECTED
M
EMANUEL WHO HAD HITHERTO STOOD
LOOKING ON DARK AS THE WINTER SOLSTICE BRIGHTENED UP SOMEWHAT HE
THOUGHT I SHOULD NOW SHOW MYSELF AT LEAST NO FOOL
HE LEARNED HIS ERROR
THOUGH ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS SURGED UP FAST
MY MIND FILLING LIKE A RISING WELL IDEAS WERE THERE BUT NOT WORDS
I
EITHER COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT SPEAK I AM NOT SURE WHICH PARTLY
I THINK MY NERVES HAD GOT WRONG AND PARTLY MY HUMOUR WAS CROSSED
I HEARD ONE OF MY EXAMINERS HE OF THE BRAIDED SURTOUT WHISPER TO HIS
CO PROFESSOR EST ELLE DONC IDIOTE
YES I THOUGHT AN IDIOT SHE IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE FOR SUCH AS
YOU
BUT I SUFFERED SUFFERED CRUELLY I SAW THE DAMPS GATHER ON M
PAUL'S
BROW AND HIS EYE SPOKE A PASSIONATE YET SAD REPROACH
HE WOULD NOT
BELIEVE IN MY TOTAL LACK OF POPULAR CLEVERNESS HE THOUGHT I COULD BE
PROMPT IF I WOULD
AT LAST TO RELIEVE HIM THE PROFESSORS AND MYSELF I STAMMERED OUT
GENTLEMEN YOU HAD BETTER LET ME GO YOU WILL GET NO GOOD OF ME AS
YOU SAY I AM AN IDIOT
I WISH I COULD HAVE SPOKEN WITH CALM AND DIGNITY OR I WISH MY SENSE
HAD SUFFICED TO MAKE ME HOLD MY TONGUE THAT TRAITOR TONGUE TRIPPED
FALTERED
BEHOLDING THE JUDGES CAST ON M
EMANUEL A HARD LOOK OF
TRIUMPH AND HEARING THE DISTRESSED TREMOR OF MY OWN VOICE OUT I BURST
IN A FIT OF CHOKING TEARS
THE EMOTION WAS FAR MORE OF ANGER THAN
GRIEF HAD I BEEN A MAN AND STRONG I COULD HAVE CHALLENGED THAT PAIR
ON THE SPOT BUT IT WAS EMOTION AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN
SCOURGED THAN BETRAYED IT
THE INCAPABLES COULD THEY NOT SEE AT ONCE THE CRUDE HAND OF A NOVICE
IN THAT COMPOSITION THEY CALLED A FORGERY THE SUBJECT WAS CLASSICAL
WHEN M
PAUL DICTATED THE TRAIT ON WHICH THE ESSAY WAS TO TURN I HEARD
IT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MATTER WAS NEW TO ME AND I HAD NO MATERIAL
FOR ITS TREATMENT
BUT I GOT BOOKS READ UP THE FACTS LABORIOUSLY
CONSTRUCTED A SKELETON OUT OF THE DRY BONES OF THE REAL AND THEN
CLOTHED THEM AND TRIED TO BREATHE INTO THEM LIFE AND IN THIS LAST AIM
I HAD PLEASURE
WITH ME IT WAS A DIFFICULT AND ANXIOUS TIME TILL MY
FACTS WERE FOUND SELECTED AND PROPERLY JOINTED NOR COULD I REST FROM
RESEARCH AND EFFORT TILL I WAS SATISFIED OF CORRECT ANATOMY THE
STRENGTH OF MY INWARD REPUGNANCE TO THE IDEA OF FLAW OR FALSITY
SOMETIMES ENABLED ME TO SHUN EGREGIOUS BLUNDERS BUT THE KNOWLEDGE WAS
NOT THERE IN MY HEAD READY AND MELLOW IT HAD NOT BEEN SOWN IN SPRING
GROWN IN SUMMER HARVESTED IN AUTUMN AND GARNERED THROUGH WINTER
WHATEVER I WANTED I MUST GO OUT AND GATHER FRESH GLEAN OF WILD HERBS
MY LAPFUL AND SHRED THEM GREEN INTO THE POT
MESSIEURS BOISSEC AND
ROCHEMORTE DID NOT PERCEIVE THIS
THEY MISTOOK MY WORK FOR THE WORK OF
A RIPE SCHOLAR
THEY WOULD NOT YET LET ME GO I MUST SIT DOWN AND WRITE BEFORE THEM
AS
I DIPPED MY PEN IN THE INK WITH A SHAKING HAND AND SURVEYED THE WHITE
PAPER WITH EYES HALF BLINDED AND OVERFLOWING ONE OF MY JUDGES BEGAN
MINCINGLY TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE PAIN HE CAUSED
NOUS AGISSONS DANS L'INTRT DE LA VRIT
NOUS NE VOULONS PAS VOUS
BLESSER SAID HE
SCORN GAVE ME NERVE
I ONLY ANSWERED
DICTATE MONSIEUR
ROCHEMORTE NAMED THIS THEME HUMAN JUSTICE
HUMAN JUSTICE WHAT WAS I TO MAKE OF IT BLANK COLD ABSTRACTION
UNSUGGESTIVE TO ME OF ONE INSPIRING IDEA AND THERE STOOD M
EMANUEL
SAD AS SAUL AND STERN AS JOAB AND THERE TRIUMPHED HIS ACCUSERS
AT THESE TWO I LOOKED
I WAS GATHERING MY COURAGE TO TELL THEM THAT I
WOULD NEITHER WRITE NOR SPEAK ANOTHER WORD FOR THEIR SATISFACTION THAT
THEIR THEME DID NOT SUIT NOR THEIR PRESENCE INSPIRE ME AND THAT
NOTWITHSTANDING WHOEVER THREW THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT ON M
EMANUEL'S
HONOUR OUTRAGED THAT TRUTH OF WHICH THEY HAD ANNOUNCED THEMSELVES
THE CHAMPIONS I MEANT TO UTTER ALL THIS I SAY WHEN SUDDENLY A
LIGHT DARTED ON MEMORY
THOSE TWO FACES LOOKING OUT OF THE FOREST OF LONG HAIR MOUSTACHE AND
WHISKER THOSE TWO COLD YET BOLD TRUSTLESS YET PRESUMPTUOUS
VISAGES WERE THE SAME FACES THE VERY SAME THAT PROJECTED IN FULL
GASLIGHT FROM BEHIND THE PILLARS OF A PORTICO HAD HALF FRIGHTENED ME
TO DEATH ON THE NIGHT OF MY DESOLATE ARRIVAL IN VILLETTE
THESE I FELT
MORALLY CERTAIN WERE THE VERY HEROES WHO HAD DRIVEN A FRIENDLESS
FOREIGNER BEYOND HER RECKONING AND HER STRENGTH CHASED HER BREATHLESS
OVER A WHOLE QUARTER OF THE TOWN
PIOUS MENTORS THOUGHT I
PURE GUIDES FOR YOUTH IF HUMAN JUSTICE'
WERE WHAT SHE OUGHT TO BE YOU TWO WOULD SCARCE HOLD YOUR PRESENT POST
OR ENJOY YOUR PRESENT CREDIT
AN IDEA ONCE SEIZED I FELL TO WORK
HUMAN JUSTICE RUSHED BEFORE ME
IN NOVEL GUISE A RED RANDOM BELDAME WITH ARMS AKIMBO
I SAW HER IN
HER HOUSE THE DEN OF CONFUSION SERVANTS CALLED TO HER FOR ORDERS OR
HELP WHICH SHE DID NOT GIVE BEGGARS STOOD AT HER DOOR WAITING AND
STARVING UNNOTICED A SWARM OF CHILDREN SICK AND QUARRELSOME CRAWLED
ROUND HER FEET AND YELLED IN HER EARS APPEALS FOR NOTICE SYMPATHY
CURE REDRESS
THE HONEST WOMAN CARED FOR NONE OF THESE THINGS
SHE HAD
A WARM SEAT OF HER OWN BY THE FIRE SHE HAD HER OWN SOLACE IN A SHORT
BLACK PIPE AND A BOTTLE OF MRS
SWEENY'S SOOTHING SYRUP SHE SMOKED
AND SHE SIPPED AND SHE ENJOYED HER PARADISE AND WHENEVER A CRY OF THE
SUFFERING SOULS ABOUT HER 'PIERCED HER EARS TOO KEENLY MY JOLLY DAME
SEIZED THE POKER OR THE HEARTH BRUSH IF THE OFFENDER WAS WEAK
WRONGED AND SICKLY SHE EFFECTUALLY SETTLED HIM IF HE WAS STRONG
LIVELY AND VIOLENT SHE ONLY MENACED THEN PLUNGED HER HAND IN HER
DEEP POUCH AND FLUNG A LIBERAL SHOWER OF SUGAR PLUMS
SUCH WAS THE SKETCH OF HUMAN JUSTICE SCRATCHED HURRIEDLY ON PAPER
AND PLACED AT THE SERVICE OF MESSRS
BOISSEC AND ROCHEMORTE
M
EMANUEL
READ IT OVER MY SHOULDER
WAITING NO COMMENT I CURTSIED TO THE TRIO
AND WITHDREW
AFTER SCHOOL THAT DAY M
PAUL AND I AGAIN MET
OF COURSE THE MEETING
DID NOT AT FIRST RUN SMOOTH THERE WAS A CROW TO PLUCK WITH HIM THAT
FORCED EXAMINATION COULD NOT BE IMMEDIATELY DIGESTED
A CRABBED
DIALOGUE TERMINATED IN MY BEING CALLED UNE PETITE MOQUEUSE ET
SANS COEUR AND IN MONSIEUR'S TEMPORARY DEPARTURE
NOT WISHING HIM TO GO QUITE AWAY ONLY DESIRING HE SHOULD FEEL THAT
SUCH A TRANSPORT AS HE HAD THAT DAY GIVEN WAY TO COULD NOT BE INDULGED
WITH PERFECT IMPUNITY I WAS NOT SORRY TO SEE HIM SOON AFTER
GARDENING IN THE BERCEAU
HE APPROACHED THE GLASS DOOR I DREW NEAR
ALSO
WE SPOKE OF SOME FLOWERS GROWING ROUND IT
BY AND BY MONSIEUR
LAID DOWN HIS SPADE BY AND BY HE RECOMMENCED CONVERSATION PASSED TO
OTHER SUBJECTS AND AT LAST TOUCHED A POINT OF INTEREST
CONSCIOUS THAT HIS PROCEEDING OF THAT DAY WAS SPECIALLY OPEN TO A
CHARGE OF EXTRAVAGANCE M
PAUL HALF APOLOGIZED HE HALF REGRETTED
TOO THE FITFULNESS OF HIS MOODS AT ALL TIMES YET HE HINTED THAT SOME
ALLOWANCE OUGHT TO BE MADE FOR HIM
BUT SAID HE I CAN HARDLY
EXPECT IT AT YOUR HANDS MISS LUCY YOU KNOW NEITHER ME NOR MY
POSITION NOR MY HISTORY
HIS HISTORY
I TOOK UP THE WORD AT ONCE I PURSUED THE IDEA
NO MONSIEUR I REJOINED
OF COURSE AS YOU SAY I KNOW NEITHER YOUR
HISTORY NOR YOUR POSITION NOR YOUR SACRIFICES NOR ANY OF YOUR
SORROWS OR TRIALS OR AFFECTIONS OR FIDELITIES
OH NO I KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT YOU YOU ARE FOR ME ALTOGETHER A STRANGER
HEIN HE MURMURED ARCHING HIS BROWS IN SURPRISE
YOU KNOW MONSIEUR I ONLY SEE YOU IN CLASSE STERN DOGMATIC HASTY
IMPERIOUS
I ONLY HEAR OF YOU IN TOWN AS ACTIVE AND WILFUL QUICK TO
ORIGINATE HASTY TO LEAD BUT SLOW TO PERSUADE AND HARD TO BEND
A MAN
LIKE YOU WITHOUT TIES CAN HAVE NO ATTACHMENTS WITHOUT DEPENDANTS NO
DUTIES
ALL WE WITH WHOM YOU COME IN CONTACT ARE MACHINES WHICH YOU
THRUST HERE AND THERE INCONSIDERATE OF THEIR FEELINGS
YOU SEEK YOUR
RECREATIONS IN PUBLIC BY THE LIGHT OF THE EVENING CHANDELIER THIS
SCHOOL AND YONDER COLLEGE ARE YOUR WORKSHOPS WHERE YOU FABRICATE THE
WARE CALLED PUPILS
I DON'T SO MUCH AS KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE IT IS
NATURAL TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT YOU HAVE NO HOME AND NEED NONE
I AM JUDGED SAID HE
YOUR OPINION OF ME IS JUST WHAT I THOUGHT IT
WAS
FOR YOU I AM NEITHER A MAN NOR A CHRISTIAN
YOU SEE ME VOID OF
AFFECTION AND RELIGION UNATTACHED BY FRIEND OR FAMILY UNPILOTED BY
PRINCIPLE OR FAITH
IT IS WELL MADEMOISELLE SUCH IS OUR REWARD IN
THIS LIFE
YOU ARE A PHILOSOPHER MONSIEUR A CYNIC PHILOSOPHER AND I LOOKED AT
HIS PALETT OF WHICH HE STRAIGHTWAY BRUSHED THE DIM SLEEVE WITH HIS
HAND DESPISING THE FOIBLES OF HUMANITY ABOVE ITS
LUXURIES INDEPENDENT OF ITS COMFORTS
ET VOUS MADEMOISELLE VOUS TES PROPRETTE ET DOUILLETTE ET
AFFREUSEMENT INSENSIBLE PAR DESSUS LE MARCH
BUT IN SHORT MONSIEUR NOW I THINK OF IT YOU MUST LIVE SOMEWHERE
DO TELL ME WHERE AND WHAT ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS DO YOU KEEP
WITH A FEARFUL PROJECTION OF THE UNDER LIP IMPLYING AN IMPETUS OF
SCORN THE MOST DECIDED HE BROKE OUT
JE VIS DANS UN TROU I INHABIT A DEN MISS A CAVERN WHERE YOU WOULD
NOT PUT YOUR DAINTY NOSE
ONCE WITH BASE SHAME OF SPEAKING THE WHOLE
TRUTH I TALKED ABOUT MY 'STUDY' IN THAT COLLEGE KNOW NOW THAT THIS
'STUDY' IS MY WHOLE ABODE MY CHAMBER IS THERE AND MY DRAWING ROOM
AS
FOR MY 'ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS' MIMICKING MY VOICE THEY NUMBER
TEN LES VOIL
AND HE GRIMLY SPREAD CLOSE UNDER MY EYES HIS TEN FINGERS
I BLACK MY BOOTS PURSUED HE SAVAGELY
I BRUSH MY PALETT
NO MONSIEUR IT IS TOO PLAIN YOU NEVER DO THAT WAS MY PARENTHESIS
JE FAIS MON LIT ET MON MNAGE I SEEK MY DINNER IN A RESTAURANT MY
SUPPER TAKES CARE OF ITSELF I PASS DAYS LABORIOUS AND LOVELESS
NIGHTS LONG AND LONELY I AM FEROCIOUS AND BEARDED AND MONKISH AND
NOTHING NOW LIVING IN THIS WORLD LOVES ME EXCEPT SOME OLD HEARTS WORN
LIKE MY OWN AND SOME FEW BEINGS IMPOVERISHED SUFFERING POOR IN
PURSE AND IN SPIRIT WHOM THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD OWN NOT BUT TO
WHOM A WILL AND TESTAMENT NOT TO BE DISPUTED HAS BEQUEATHED THE KINGDOM
OF HEAVEN
AH MONSIEUR BUT I KNOW
WHAT DO YOU KNOW MANY THINGS I VERILY BELIEVE YET NOT ME LUCY
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A PLEASANT OLD HOUSE IN A PLEASANT OLD SQUARE OF
THE BASSE VILLE WHY DON'T YOU GO AND LIVE THERE
HEIN MUTTERED HE AGAIN
I LIKED IT MUCH MONSIEUR WITH THE STEPS ASCENDING TO THE DOOR THE
GREY FLAGS IN FRONT THE NODDING TREES BEHIND REAL TREES NOT
SHRUBS TREES DARK HIGH AND OF OLD GROWTH
AND THE
BOUDOIR ORATOIRE YOU SHOULD MAKE THAT ROOM YOUR STUDY IT IS SO QUIET
AND SOLEMN
HE EYED ME CLOSELY HE HALF SMILED HALF COLOURED
WHERE DID YOU PICK
UP ALL THAT WHO TOLD YOU HE ASKED
NOBODY TOLD ME
DID I DREAM IT MONSIEUR DO YOU THINK
CAN I ENTER INTO YOUR VISIONS CAN I GUESS A WOMAN'S WAKING THOUGHTS
MUCH LESS HER SLEEPING FANTASIES
IF I DREAMT IT I SAW IN MY DREAM HUMAN BEINGS AS WELL AS A HOUSE
I
SAW A PRIEST OLD BENT AND GREY AND A DOMESTIC OLD TOO AND
PICTURESQUE AND A LADY SPLENDID BUT STRANGE HER HEAD WOULD SCARCE
REACH TO MY ELBOW HER MAGNIFICENCE MIGHT RANSOM A DUKE
SHE WORE A
GOWN BRIGHT AS LAPIS LAZULI A SHAWL WORTH A THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WAS
DECKED WITH ORNAMENTS SO BRILLIANT I NEVER SAW ANY WITH SUCH A
BEAUTIFUL SPARKLE BUT HER FIGURE LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN BROKEN IN
TWO AND BENT DOUBLE SHE SEEMED ALSO TO HAVE OUTLIVED THE COMMON YEARS
OF HUMANITY AND TO HAVE ATTAINED THOSE WHICH ARE ONLY LABOUR AND
SORROW
SHE WAS BECOME MOROSE ALMOST MALEVOLENT YET SOMEBODY IT
APPEARS CARED FOR HER IN HER INFIRMITIES SOMEBODY FORGAVE HER
TRESPASSES HOPING TO HAVE HIS TRESPASSES FORGIVEN
THEY LIVED
TOGETHER THESE THREE PEOPLE THE MISTRESS THE CHAPLAIN THE
SERVANT ALL OLD ALL FEEBLE ALL SHELTERED UNDER ONE KIND WING
HE COVERED WITH HIS HAND THE UPPER PART OF HIS FACE BUT DID NOT
CONCEAL HIS MOUTH WHERE I SAW HOVERING AN EXPRESSION I LIKED
I SEE YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO MY SECRETS SAID HE BUT HOW WAS IT
DONE
SO I TOLD HIM HOW THE COMMISSION ON WHICH I HAD BEEN SENT THE STORM
WHICH HAD DETAINED ME THE ABRUPTNESS OF THE LADY THE KINDNESS OF THE
PRIEST
AS I SAT WAITING FOR THE RAIN TO CEASE PRE SILAS WHILED AWAY THE
TIME WITH A STORY I SAID
A STORY WHAT STORY PRE SILAS IS NO ROMANCIST
SHALL I TELL MONSIEUR THE TALE
YES BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING
LET ME HEAR SOME OF MISS LUCY'S
FRENCH HER BEST OR HER WORST I DON'T MUCH CARE WHICH LET US HAVE A
GOOD POIGNE OF BARBARISMS AND A BOUNTEOUS DOSE OF THE INSULAR ACCENT
MONSIEUR IS NOT GOING TO BE GRATIFIED BY A TALE OF AMBITIOUS
PROPORTIONS AND THE SPECTACLE OF THE NARRATOR STICKING FAST IN THE
MIDST
BUT I WILL TELL HIM THE TITLE THE 'PRIEST'S PUPIL
BAH SAID HE THE SWARTHY FLUSH AGAIN DYEING HIS DARK CHEEK
THE
GOOD OLD FATHER COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A WORSE SUBJECT IT IS HIS WEAK
POINT
BUT WHAT OF THE 'PRIEST'S PUPIL
OH MANY THINGS
YOU MAY AS WELL DEFINE WHAT THINGS
I MEAN TO KNOW
THERE WAS THE PUPIL'S YOUTH THE PUPIL'S MANHOOD HIS AVARICE HIS
INGRATITUDE HIS IMPLACABILITY HIS INCONSTANCY
SUCH A BAD PUPIL
MONSIEUR SO THANKLESS COLD HEARTED UNCHIVALROUS UNFORGIVING
ET PUIS SAID HE TAKING A CIGAR
ET PUIS I PURSUED HE UNDERWENT CALAMITIES WHICH ONE DID NOT
PITY BORE THEM IN A SPIRIT ONE DID NOT ADMIRE ENDURED WRONGS FOR
WHICH ONE FELT NO SYMPATHY FINALLY TOOK THE UNCHRISTIAN REVENGE OF
HEAPING COALS OF FIRE ON HIS ADVERSARY'S HEAD
YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME ALL SAID HE
NEARLY ALL I THINK I HAVE INDICATED THE HEADS OF PRE SILAS'S
CHAPTERS
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ONE THAT WHICH TOUCHED ON THE PUPIL'S LACK OF
AFFECTION ON HIS HARD COLD MONKISH HEART
TRUE I REMEMBER NOW
PRE SILAS DID SAY THAT HIS VOCATION WAS
ALMOST THAT OF A PRIEST THAT HIS LIFE WAS CONSIDERED CONSECRATED
BY WHAT BONDS OR DUTIES
BY THE TIES OF THE PAST AND THE CHARITIES OF THE PRESENT
YOU HAVE THEN THE WHOLE SITUATION
I HAVE NOW TOLD MONSIEUR ALL THAT WAS TOLD ME
SOME MEDITATIVE MINUTES PASSED
NOW MADEMOISELLE LUCY LOOK AT ME AND WITH THAT TRUTH WHICH I
BELIEVE YOU NEVER KNOWINGLY VIOLATE ANSWER ME ONE QUESTION
RAISE YOUR
EYES REST THEM ON MINE HAVE NO HESITATION FEAR NOT TO TRUST ME I AM
A MAN TO BE TRUSTED
I RAISED MY EYES
KNOWING ME THOROUGHLY NOW ALL MY ANTECEDENTS ALL MY
RESPONSIBILITIES HAVING LONG KNOWN MY FAULTS CAN YOU AND I STILL BE
FRIENDS
IF MONSIEUR WANTS A FRIEND IN ME I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE A FRIEND IN
HIM
BUT A CLOSE FRIEND I MEAN INTIMATE AND REAL KINDRED IN ALL BUT
BLOOD
WILL MISS LUCY BE THE SISTER OF A VERY POOR FETTERED BURDENED
ENCUMBERED MAN
I COULD NOT ANSWER HIM IN WORDS YET I SUPPOSE I DID ANSWER HIM HE
TOOK MY HAND WHICH FOUND COMFORT IN THE SHELTER OF HIS
HIS
FRIENDSHIP WAS NOT A DOUBTFUL WAVERING BENEFIT A COLD DISTANT
HOPE A SENTIMENT SO BRITTLE AS NOT TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF A FINGER I
AT ONCE FELT OR THOUGHT I FELT ITS SUPPORT LIKE THAT OF SOME ROCK
WHEN I TALK OF FRIENDSHIP I MEAN TRUE FRIENDSHIP HE REPEATED
EMPHATICALLY AND I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT WORDS SO EARNEST HAD
BLESSED MY EAR I HARDLY COULD CREDIT THE REALITY OF THAT KIND ANXIOUS
LOOK HE GAVE
IF HE REALLY WISHED FOR MY CONFIDENCE AND REGARD AND
REALLY WOULD GIVE ME HIS WHY IT SEEMED TO ME THAT LIFE COULD OFFER
NOTHING MORE OR BETTER
IN THAT CASE I WAS BECOME STRONG AND RICH IN
A MOMENT I WAS MADE SUBSTANTIALLY HAPPY
TO ASCERTAIN THE FACT TO FIX
AND SEAL IT I ASKED
IS MONSIEUR QUITE SERIOUS DOES HE REALLY THINK HE NEEDS ME AND CAN
TAKE AN INTEREST IN ME AS A SISTER
SURELY SURELY SAID HE A LONELY MAN LIKE ME WHO HAS NO SISTER
MUST BE BUT TOO GLAD TO FIND IN SOME WOMAN'S HEART A SISTER'S PURE
AFFECTION
AND DARE I RELY ON MONSIEUR'S REGARD DARE I SPEAK TO HIM WHEN I AM SO
INCLINED
MY LITTLE SISTER MUST MAKE HER OWN EXPERIMENTS SAID HE I WILL GIVE
NO PROMISES
SHE MUST TEASE AND TRY HER WAYWARD BROTHER TILL SHE HAS
DRILLED HIM INTO WHAT SHE WISHES
AFTER ALL HE IS NO INDUCTILE
MATERIAL IN SOME HANDS
WHILE HE SPOKE THE TONE OF HIS VOICE THE LIGHT OF HIS NOW
AFFECTIONATE EYE GAVE ME SUCH A PLEASURE AS CERTAINLY I HAD NEVER
FELT
I ENVIED NO GIRL HER LOVER NO BRIDE HER BRIDEGROOM NO WIFE HER
HUSBAND I WAS CONTENT WITH THIS MY VOLUNTARY SELF OFFERING FRIEND
IF
HE WOULD BUT PROVE RELIABLE AND HE LOOKED RELIABLE WHAT BEYOND HIS
FRIENDSHIP COULD I EVER COVET BUT IF ALL MELTED LIKE A DREAM AS
ONCE BEFORE HAD HAPPENED
QU'EST CE DONC WHAT IS IT SAID HE AS THIS THOUGHT THREW ITS WEIGHT
ON MY HEART ITS SHADOW ON MY COUNTENANCE
I TOLD HIM AND AFTER A
MOMENT'S PAUSE AND A THOUGHTFUL SMILE HE SHOWED ME HOW AN EQUAL
FEAR LEST I SHOULD WEARY OF HIM A MAN OF MOODS SO DIFFICULT AND
FITFUL HAD HAUNTED HIS MIND FOR MORE THAN ONE DAY OR ONE MONTH
ON HEARING THIS A QUIET COURAGE CHEERED ME
I VENTURED A WORD OF
RE ASSURANCE
THAT WORD WAS NOT ONLY TOLERATED ITS REPETITION WAS
COURTED
I GREW QUITE HAPPY STRANGELY HAPPY IN MAKING HIM SECURE
CONTENT TRANQUIL
YESTERDAY I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED THAT EARTH
HELD OR LIFE AFFORDED MOMENTS LIKE THE FEW I WAS NOW PASSING
COUNTLESS TIMES IT HAD BEEN MY LOT TO WATCH APPREHENDED SORROW CLOSE
DARKLY IN BUT TO SEE UNHOPED FOR HAPPINESS TAKE FORM FIND PLACE AND
GROW MORE REAL AS THE SECONDS SPED WAS INDEED A NEW EXPERIENCE
LUCY SAID M
PAUL SPEAKING LOW AND STILL HOLDING MY HAND DID YOU
SEE A PICTURE IN THE BOUDOIR OF THE OLD HOUSE
I DID A PICTURE PAINTED ON A PANEL
THE PORTRAIT OF A NUN
YES
YOU HEARD HER HISTORY
YES
YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE SAW THAT NIGHT IN THE BERCEAU
I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT
YOU DID NOT CONNECT THE TWO IDEAS THAT WOULD BE FOLLY
I THOUGHT OF THE APPARITION WHEN I SAW THE PORTRAIT SAID I WHICH
WAS TRUE ENOUGH
YOU DID NOT NOR WILL YOU FANCY PURSUED HE THAT A SAINT IN HEAVEN
PERTURBS HERSELF WITH RIVALRIES OF EARTH PROTESTANTS ARE RARELY
SUPERSTITIOUS THESE MORBID FANCIES WILL NOT BESET YOU
I KNOW NOT WHAT TO THINK OF THIS MATTER BUT I BELIEVE A PERFECTLY
NATURAL SOLUTION OF THIS SEEMING MYSTERY WILL ONE DAY BE ARRIVED AT
DOUBTLESS DOUBTLESS
BESIDES NO GOOD LIVING WOMAN MUCH LESS A PURE
HAPPY SPIRIT WOULD TROUBLE AMITY LIKE OURS N'EST IL PAS VRAI
ERE I COULD ANSWER FIFINE BECK BURST IN ROSY AND ABRUPT CALLING OUT
THAT I WAS WANTED
HER MOTHER WAS GOING INTO TOWN TO CALL ON SOME
ENGLISH FAMILY WHO HAD APPLIED FOR A PROSPECTUS MY SERVICES WERE
NEEDED AS INTERPRETER
THE INTERRUPTION WAS NOT UNSEASONABLE
SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY IS ALWAYS THE EVIL FOR THIS HOUR ITS GOOD
SUFFICED
YET I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO ASK M
PAUL WHETHER THE MORBID
FANCIES AGAINST WHICH HE WARNED ME WROUGHT IN HIS OWN BRAIN
CHAPTER XXXVI
THE APPLE OF DISCORD
BESIDES FIFINE BECK'S MOTHER ANOTHER POWER HAD A WORD TO SAY TO M
PAUL AND ME BEFORE THAT COVENANT OF FRIENDSHIP COULD BE RATIFIED
WE
WERE UNDER THE SURVEILLANCE OF A SLEEPLESS EYE ROME WATCHED JEALOUSLY
HER SON THROUGH THAT MYSTIC LATTICE AT WHICH I HAD KNELT ONCE AND TO
WHICH M
EMANUEL DREW NIGH MONTH BY MONTH THE SLIDING PANEL OF THE
CONFESSIONAL
WHY WERE YOU SO GLAD TO BE FRIENDS WITH M
PAUL ASKS THE READER
HAD HE NOT LONG BEEN A FRIEND TO YOU HAD HE NOT GIVEN PROOF ON PROOF
OF A CERTAIN PARTIALITY IN HIS FEELINGS
YES HE HAD BUT STILL I LIKED TO HEAR HIM SAY SO EARNESTLY THAT HE
WAS MY CLOSE TRUE FRIEND I LIKED HIS MODEST DOUBTS HIS TENDER
DEFERENCE THAT TRUST WHICH LONGED TO REST AND WAS GRATEFUL WHEN
TAUGHT HOW
HE HAD CALLED ME SISTER IT WAS WELL
YES HE MIGHT CALL
ME WHAT HE PLEASED SO LONG AS HE CONFIDED IN ME
I WAS WILLING TO BE
HIS SISTER ON CONDITION THAT HE DID NOT INVITE ME TO FILL THAT
RELATION TO SOME FUTURE WIFE OF HIS AND TACITLY VOWED AS HE WAS TO
CELIBACY OF THIS DILEMMA THERE SEEMED LITTLE DANGER
THROUGH MOST OF THE SUCCEEDING NIGHT I PONDERED THAT EVENING'S
INTERVIEW
I WANTED MUCH THE MORNING TO BREAK AND THEN LISTENED FOR
THE BELL TO RING AND AFTER RISING AND DRESSING I DEEMED PRAYERS AND
BREAKFAST SLOW AND ALL THE HOURS LINGERING TILL THAT ARRIVED AT LAST
WHICH BROUGHT ME THE LESSON OF LITERATURE
MY WISH WAS TO GET A MORE
THOROUGH COMPREHENSION OF THIS FRATERNAL ALLIANCE TO NOTE WITH HOW
MUCH OF THE BROTHER HE WOULD DEMEAN HIMSELF WHEN WE MET AGAIN TO PROVE
HOW MUCH OF THE SISTER WAS IN MY OWN FEELINGS TO DISCOVER WHETHER I
COULD SUMMON A SISTER'S COURAGE AND HE A BROTHER'S FRANKNESS
HE CAME
LIFE IS SO CONSTRUCTED THAT THE EVENT DOES NOT CANNOT WILL
NOT MATCH THE EXPECTATION
THAT WHOLE DAY HE NEVER ACCOSTED ME
HIS
LESSON WAS GIVEN RATHER MORE QUIETLY THAN USUAL MORE MILDLY AND ALSO
MORE GRAVELY
HE WAS FATHERLY TO HIS PUPILS BUT HE WAS NOT BROTHERLY
TO ME
ERE HE LEFT THE CLASSE I EXPECTED A SMILE IF NOT A WORD I GOT
NEITHER TO MY PORTION FELL ONE NOD HURRIED SHY
THIS DISTANCE I ARGUED IS ACCIDENTAL IT IS INVOLUNTARY PATIENCE
AND IT WILL VANISH
IT VANISHED NOT IT CONTINUED FOR DAYS IT
INCREASED
I SUPPRESSED MY SURPRISE AND SWALLOWED WHATEVER OTHER
FEELINGS BEGAN TO SURGE
WELL MIGHT I ASK WHEN HE OFFERED FRATERNITY DARE I RELY ON YOU WELL
MIGHT HE DOUBTLESS KNOWING HIMSELF WITHHOLD ALL PLEDGE
TRUE HE HAD
BID ME MAKE MY OWN EXPERIMENTS TEASE AND TRY HIM
VAIN INJUNCTION
PRIVILEGE NOMINAL AND UNAVAILABLE SOME WOMEN MIGHT USE IT NOTHING IN
MY POWERS OR INSTINCT PLACED ME AMONGST THIS BRAVE BAND
LEFT ALONE I
WAS PASSIVE REPULSED I WITHDREW FORGOTTEN MY LIPS WOULD NOT UTTER
NOR MY EYES DART A REMINDER
IT SEEMED THERE HAD BEEN AN ERROR
SOMEWHERE IN MY CALCULATIONS AND I WANTED FOR TIME TO DISCLOSE IT
BUT THE DAY CAME WHEN AS USUAL HE WAS TO GIVE ME A LESSON
ONE
EVENING IN SEVEN HE HAD LONG GENEROUSLY BESTOWED ON ME DEVOTING IT TO
THE EXAMINATION OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE IN VARIOUS STUDIES DURING THE
PAST WEEK AND TO THE PREPARATION OF WORK FOR THE WEEK IN PROSPECT
ON
THESE OCCASIONS MY SCHOOLROOM WAS ANYWHERE WHEREVER THE PUPILS AND THE
OTHER TEACHERS HAPPENED TO BE OR IN THEIR CLOSE VICINAGE VERY OFTEN
IN THE LARGE SECOND DIVISION WHERE IT WAS EASY TO CHOOSE A QUIET NOOK
WHEN THE CROWDING DAY PUPILS WERE ABSENT AND THE FEW BOARDERS GATHERED
IN A KNOT ABOUT THE SURVEILLANTE'S ESTRADE
ON THE CUSTOMARY EVENING HEARING THE CUSTOMARY HOUR STRIKE I
COLLECTED MY BOOKS AND PAPERS MY PEN AND INK AND SOUGHT THE LARGE
DIVISION
IN CLASSE THERE WAS NO ONE AND IT LAY ALL IN COOL DEEP SHADOW BUT
THROUGH THE OPEN DOUBLE DOORS WAS SEEN THE CARR FILLED WITH PUPILS
AND WITH LIGHT OVER HALL AND FIGURES BLUSHED THE WESTERING SUN
IT
BLUSHED SO RUDDILY AND VIVIDLY THAT THE HUES OF THE WALLS AND THE
VARIEGATED TINTS OF THE DRESSES SEEMED ALL FUSED IN ONE WARM GLOW
THE
GIRLS WERE SEATED WORKING OR STUDYING IN THE MIDST OF THEIR CIRCLE
STOOD M
EMANUEL SPEAKING GOOD HUMOUREDLY TO A TEACHER
HIS DARK
PALETT HIS JETTY HAIR WERE TINGED WITH MANY A REFLEX OF CRIMSON HIS
SPANISH FACE WHEN HE TURNED IT MOMENTARILY ANSWERED THE SUN'S
ANIMATED KISS WITH AN ANIMATED SMILE
I TOOK MY PLACE AT A DESK
THE ORANGE TREES AND SEVERAL PLANTS FULL AND BRIGHT WITH BLOOM
BASKED ALSO IN THE SUN'S LAUGHING BOUNTY THEY HAD PARTAKEN IT THE
WHOLE DAY AND NOW ASKED WATER
M
EMANUEL HAD A TASTE FOR GARDENING
HE LIKED TO TEND AND FOSTER PLANTS
I USED TO THINK THAT WORKING
AMONGST SHRUBS WITH A SPADE OR A WATERING POT SOOTHED HIS NERVES IT
WAS A RECREATION TO WHICH HE OFTEN HAD RECOURSE AND NOW HE LOOKED TO
THE ORANGE TREES THE GERANIUMS THE GORGEOUS CACTUSES AND REVIVED
THEM ALL WITH THE REFRESHMENT THEIR DROUGHT NEEDED
HIS LIPS MEANTIME
SUSTAINED HIS PRECIOUS CIGAR THAT FOR HIM FIRST NECESSARY AND PRIME
LUXURY OF LIFE ITS BLUE WREATHS CURLED PRETTILY ENOUGH AMONGST THE
FLOWERS AND IN THE EVENING LIGHT
HE SPOKE NO MORE TO THE PUPILS NOR
TO THE MISTRESSES BUT GAVE MANY AN ENDEARING WORD TO A SMALL
SPANIELESS IF ONE MAY COIN A WORD THAT NOMINALLY BELONGED TO THE
HOUSE BUT VIRTUALLY OWNED HIM AS MASTER BEING FONDER OF HIM THAN ANY
INMATE
A DELICATE SILKY LOVING AND LOVABLE LITTLE DOGGIE SHE WAS
TROTTING AT HIS SIDE LOOKING WITH EXPRESSIVE ATTACHED EYES INTO HIS
FACE AND WHENEVER HE DROPPED HIS BONNET GREC OR HIS HANDKERCHIEF
WHICH HE OCCASIONALLY DID IN PLAY CROUCHING BESIDE IT WITH THE AIR OF
A MINIATURE LION GUARDING A KINGDOM'S FLAG
THERE WERE MANY PLANTS AND AS THE AMATEUR GARDENER FETCHED ALL THE
WATER FROM THE WELL IN THE COURT WITH HIS OWN ACTIVE HANDS HIS WORK
SPUN ON TO SOME LENGTH
THE GREAT SCHOOL CLOCK TICKED ON
ANOTHER HOUR
STRUCK
THE CARR AND THE YOUTHFUL GROUP LOST THE ILLUSION OF SUNSET
DAY WAS DROOPING
MY LESSON I PERCEIVED MUST TO NIGHT BE VERY SHORT
BUT THE ORANGE TREES THE CACTI THE CAMELIAS WERE ALL SERVED NOW
WAS
IT MY TURN
ALAS IN THE GARDEN WERE MORE PLANTS TO BE LOOKED AFTER FAVOURITE
ROSE BUSHES CERTAIN CHOICE FLOWERS LITTLE SYLVIE'S GLAD BARK AND
WHINE FOLLOWED THE RECEDING PALETT DOWN THE ALLEYS
I PUT UP SOME OF
MY BOOKS I SHOULD NOT WANT THEM ALL I SAT AND THOUGHT AND WAITED
INVOLUNTARILY DEPRECATING THE CREEPING INVASION OF TWILIGHT
SYLVIE GAILY FRISKING EMERGED INTO VIEW ONCE MORE HERALDING THE
RETURNING PALETT THE WATERING POT WAS DEPOSITED BESIDE THE WELL IT
HAD FULFILLED ITS OFFICE HOW GLAD I WAS MONSIEUR WASHED HIS HANDS IN
A LITTLE STONE BOWL
THERE WAS NO LONGER TIME FOR A LESSON NOW ERE
LONG THE PRAYER BELL MUST RING BUT STILL WE SHOULD MEET HE WOULD
SPEAK A CHANCE WOULD BE OFFERED OF READING IN HIS EYES THE RIDDLE OF
HIS SHYNESS
HIS ABLUTIONS OVER HE STOOD SLOWLY RE ARRANGING HIS
CUFFS LOOKING AT THE HORN OF A YOUNG MOON SET PALE IN THE OPAL SKY
AND GLIMMERING FAINT ON THE ORIEL OF JEAN BAPTISTE
SYLVIE WATCHED THE
MOOD CONTEMPLATIVE ITS STILLNESS IRKED HER SHE WHINED AND JUMPED TO
BREAK IT
HE LOOKED DOWN
PETITE EXIGEANTE SAID HE YOU MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN ONE MOMENT IT
SEEMS
HE STOPPED LIFTED HER IN HIS ARMS SAUNTERED ACROSS THE COURT WITHIN
A YARD OF THE LINE OF WINDOWS NEAR ONE OF WHICH I SAT HE SAUNTERED
LINGERINGLY FONDLING THE SPANIEL IN HIS BOSOM CALLING HER TENDER
NAMES IN A TENDER VOICE
ON THE FRONT DOOR STEPS HE TURNED ONCE AGAIN
HE LOOKED AT THE MOON AT THE GREY CATHEDRAL OVER THE REMOTER SPIRES
AND HOUSE ROOFS FADING INTO A BLUE SEA OF NIGHT MIST HE TASTED THE
SWEET BREATH OF DUSK AND NOTED THE FOLDED BLOOM OF THE GARDEN HE
SUDDENLY LOOKED ROUND A KEEN BEAM OUT OF HIS EYE RASED THE WHITE
FAADE OF THE CLASSES SWEPT THE LONG LINE OF CROISES
I THINK HE
BOWED IF HE DID I HAD NO TIME TO RETURN THE COURTESY
IN A MOMENT HE
WAS GONE THE MOONLIT THRESHOLD LAY PALE AND SHADOWLESS BEFORE THE
CLOSED FRONT DOOR
GATHERING IN MY ARMS ALL THAT WAS SPREAD ON THE DESK BEFORE ME I
CARRIED BACK THE UNUSED HEAP TO ITS PLACE IN THE THIRD CLASSE
THE
PRAYER BELL RANG I OBEYED ITS SUMMONS
THE MORROW WOULD NOT RESTORE HIM TO THE RUE FOSSETTE THAT DAY BEING
DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO HIS COLLEGE
I GOT THROUGH MY TEACHING I GOT OVER
THE INTERMEDIATE HOURS I SAW EVENING APPROACHING AND ARMED MYSELF FOR
ITS HEAVY ENNUIS
WHETHER IT WAS WORSE TO STAY WITH MY CO INMATES OR
TO SIT ALONE I HAD NOT CONSIDERED I NATURALLY TOOK UP THE LATTER
ALTERNATIVE IF THERE WAS A HOPE OF COMFORT FOR ANY MOMENT THE HEART
OR HEAD OF NO HUMAN BEING IN THIS HOUSE COULD YIELD IT ONLY UNDER THE
LID OF MY DESK COULD IT HARBOUR NESTLING BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF SOME
BOOK GILDING A PENCIL POINT THE NIB OF A PEN OR TINGING THE BLACK
FLUID IN THAT INK GLASS
WITH A HEAVY HEART I OPENED MY DESK LID WITH
A WEARY HAND I TURNED UP ITS CONTENTS
ONE BY ONE WELL ACCUSTOMED BOOKS VOLUMES SEWN IN FAMILIAR COVERS
WERE TAKEN OUT AND PUT BACK HOPELESS THEY HAD NO CHARM THEY COULD NOT
COMFORT
IS THIS SOMETHING NEW THIS PAMPHLET IN LILAC I HAD NOT SEEN
IT BEFORE AND I RE ARRANGED MY DESK THIS VERY DAY THIS VERY
AFTERNOON THE TRACT MUST HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED WITHIN THE LAST HOUR
WHILE WE WERE AT DINNER
I OPENED IT
WHAT WAS IT WHAT WOULD IT SAY TO ME
IT WAS NEITHER TALE NOR POEM NEITHER ESSAY NOR HISTORY IT NEITHER
SUNG NOR RELATED NOT DISCUSSED
IT WAS A THEOLOGICAL WORK IT
PREACHED AND IT PERSUADED
I LENT TO IT MY EAR VERY WILLINGLY FOR SMALL AS IT WAS IT POSSESSED
ITS OWN SPELL AND BOUND MY ATTENTION AT ONCE
IT PREACHED ROMANISM IT
PERSUADED TO CONVERSION
THE VOICE OF THAT SLY LITTLE BOOK WAS A
HONEYED VOICE ITS ACCENTS WERE ALL UNCTION AND BALM
HERE ROARED NO
UTTERANCE OF ROME'S THUNDERS NO BLASTING OF THE BREATH OF HER
DISPLEASURE
THE PROTESTANT WAS TO TURN PAPIST NOT SO MUCH IN FEAR OF
THE HERETIC'S HELL AS ON ACCOUNT OF THE COMFORT THE INDULGENCE THE
TENDERNESS HOLY CHURCH OFFERED FAR BE IT FROM HER TO THREATEN OR TO
COERCE HER WISH WAS TO GUIDE AND WIN
SHE PERSECUTE OH DEAR NO NOT
ON ANY ACCOUNT
THIS MEEK VOLUME WAS NOT ADDRESSED TO THE HARDENED AND WORLDLY IT WAS
NOT EVEN STRONG MEAT FOR THE STRONG IT WAS MILK FOR BABES THE MILD
EFFLUENCE OF A MOTHER'S LOVE TOWARDS HER TENDEREST AND HER YOUNGEST
INTENDED WHOLLY AND SOLELY FOR THOSE WHOSE HEAD IS TO BE REACHED
THROUGH THE HEART
ITS APPEAL WAS NOT TO INTELLECT IT SOUGHT TO WIN
THE AFFECTIONATE THROUGH THEIR AFFECTIONS THE SYMPATHIZING THROUGH
THEIR SYMPATHIES ST
VINCENT DE PAUL GATHERING HIS ORPHANS ABOUT HIM
NEVER SPOKE MORE SWEETLY
I REMEMBER ONE CAPITAL INDUCEMENT TO APOSTACY WAS HELD OUT IN THE FACT
THAT THE CATHOLIC WHO HAD LOST DEAR FRIENDS BY DEATH COULD ENJOY THE
UNSPEAKABLE SOLACE OF PRAYING THEM OUT OF PURGATORY
THE WRITER DID NOT
TOUCH ON THE FIRMER PEACE OF THOSE WHOSE BELIEF DISPENSES WITH
PURGATORY ALTOGETHER BUT I THOUGHT OF THIS AND ON THE WHOLE
PREFERRED THE LATTER DOCTRINE AS THE MOST CONSOLATORY
THE LITTLE BOOK
AMUSED AND DID NOT PAINFULLY DISPLEASE ME
IT WAS A CANTING
SENTIMENTAL SHALLOW LITTLE BOOK YET SOMETHING ABOUT IT CHEERED MY
GLOOM AND MADE ME SMILE I WAS AMUSED WITH THE GAMBOLS OF THIS UNLICKED
WOLF CUB MUFFLED IN THE FLEECE AND MIMICKING THE BLEAT OF A GUILELESS
LAMB
PORTIONS OF IT REMINDED ME OF CERTAIN WESLEYAN METHODIST TRACTS I
HAD ONCE READ WHEN A CHILD THEY WERE FLAVOURED WITH ABOUT THE SAME
SEASONING OF EXCITATION TO FANATICISM
HE THAT HAD WRITTEN IT WAS NO
BAD MAN AND WHILE PERPETUALLY BETRAYING THE TRAINED CUNNING THE
CLOVEN HOOF OF HIS SYSTEM I SHOULD PAUSE BEFORE ACCUSING HIMSELF OF
INSINCERITY
HIS JUDGMENT HOWEVER WANTED SURGICAL PROPS IT WAS
RICKETY
I SMILED THEN OVER THIS DOSE OF MATERNAL TENDERNESS COMING FROM THE
RUDDY OLD LADY OF THE SEVEN HILLS SMILED TOO AT MY OWN
DISINCLINATION NOT TO SAY DISABILITY TO MEET THESE MELTING FAVOURS
GLANCING AT THE TITLE PAGE I FOUND THE NAME OF PRE SILAS A
FLY LEAF BORE IN SMALL BUT CLEAR AND WELL KNOWN PENCIL CHARACTERS
FROM P
C
D
E
TO L Y AND WHEN I SAW THIS I LAUGHED BUT NOT IN
MY FORMER SPIRIT
I WAS REVIVED
A MORTAL BEWILDERMENT CLEARED SUDDENLY FROM MY HEAD AND VISION THE
SOLUTION OF THE SPHINX RIDDLE WAS WON THE CONJUNCTION OF THOSE TWO
NAMES PRE SILAS AND PAUL EMANUEL GAVE THE KEY TO ALL
THE PENITENT
HAD BEEN WITH HIS DIRECTOR PERMITTED TO WITHHOLD NOTHING SUFFERED TO
KEEP NO CORNER OF HIS HEART SACRED TO GOD AND TO HIMSELF THE WHOLE
NARRATIVE OF OUR LATE INTERVIEW HAD BEEN DRAWN FROM HIM HE HAD AVOWED
THE COVENANT OF FRATERNITY AND SPOKEN OF HIS ADOPTED SISTER
HOW COULD
SUCH A COVENANT SUCH ADOPTION BE SANCTIONED BY THE CHURCH FRATERNAL
COMMUNION WITH A HERETIC I SEEMED TO HEAR PRE SILAS ANNULLING THE
UNHOLY PACT WARNING HIS PENITENT OF ITS PERILS ENTREATING ENJOINING
RESERVE NAY BY THE AUTHORITY OF HIS OFFICE AND IN THE NAME AND BY
THE MEMORY OF ALL M
EMANUEL HELD MOST DEAR AND SACRED COMMANDING THE
ENFORCEMENT OF THAT NEW SYSTEM WHOSE FROST HAD PIERCED TO THE MARROW OF
MY BONES
THESE MAY NOT SEEM PLEASANT HYPOTHESES YET BY COMPARISON THEY WERE
WELCOME
THE VISION OF A GHOSTLY TROUBLER HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND
WAS AS NOTHING MATCHED WITH THE FEAR OF SPONTANEOUS CHANGE ARISING IN
M
PAUL HIMSELF
AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME I CANNOT BE SURE HOW FAR THE ABOVE
CONJECTURES WERE SELF SUGGESTED OR IN WHAT MEASURE THEY OWED THEIR
ORIGIN AND CONFIRMATION TO ANOTHER QUARTER
HELP WAS NOT WANTING
THIS EVENING THERE WAS NO BRIGHT SUNSET WEST AND EAST WERE ONE CLOUD
NO SUMMER NIGHT MIST BLUE YET ROSE TINGED SOFTENED THE DISTANCE A
CLAMMY FOG FROM THE MARSHES CREPT GREY ROUND VILLETTE
TO NIGHT THE
WATERING POT MIGHT REST IN ITS NICHE BY THE WELL A SMALL RAIN HAD BEEN
DRIZZLING ALL THE AFTERNOON AND STILL IT FELL FAST AND QUIETLY
THIS
WAS NO WEATHER FOR RAMBLING IN THE WET ALLEYS UNDER THE DRIPPING
TREES AND I STARTED TO HEAR SYLVIE'S SUDDEN BARK IN THE GARDEN HER
BARK OF WELCOME
SURELY SHE WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED AND YET THIS GLAD
QUICK BARK WAS NEVER UTTERED SAVE IN HOMAGE TO ONE PRESENCE
THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR AND THE ARCHING BERCEAU I COMMANDED THE DEEP
VISTA OF THE ALLE DFENDUE THITHER RUSHED SYLVIE GLISTENING THROUGH
ITS GLOOM LIKE A WHITE GUELDER ROSE
SHE RAN TO AND FRO WHINING
SPRINGING HARASSING LITTLE BIRDS AMONGST THE BUSHES
I WATCHED FIVE
MINUTES NO FULFILMENT FOLLOWED THE OMEN
I RETURNED TO MY BOOKS
SYLVIE'S SHARP BARK SUDDENLY CEASED
AGAIN I LOOKED UP
SHE WAS
STANDING NOT MANY YARDS DISTANT WAGGING HER WHITE FEATHERY TAIL AS
FAST AS THE MUSCLE WOULD WORK AND INTENTLY WATCHING THE OPERATIONS OF
A SPADE PLIED FAST BY AN INDEFATIGABLE HAND
THERE WAS M
EMANUEL
BENT OVER THE SOIL DIGGING IN THE WET MOULD AMONGST THE RAIN LADEN AND
STREAMING SHRUBS WORKING AS HARD AS IF HIS DAY'S PITTANCE WERE YET TO
EARN BY THE LITERAL SWEAT OF HIS BROW
IN THIS SIGN I READ A RUFFLED MOOD
HE WOULD DIG THUS IN FROZEN SNOW ON
THE COLDEST WINTER DAY WHEN URGED INWARDLY BY PAINFUL EMOTION WHETHER
OF NERVOUS EXCITATION OR SAD THOUGHTS OF SELF REPROACH
HE WOULD DIG
BY THE HOUR WITH KNIT BROW AND SET TEETH NOR ONCE LIFT HIS HEAD OR
OPEN HIS LIPS
SYLVIE WATCHED TILL SHE WAS TIRED
AGAIN SCAMPERING DEVIOUS BOUNDING
HERE RUSHING THERE SNUFFING AND SNIFFING EVERYWHERE SHE AT LAST
DISCOVERED ME IN CLASSE
INSTANTLY SHE FLEW BARKING AT THE PANES AS IF
TO URGE ME FORTH TO SHARE HER PLEASURE OR HER MASTER'S TOIL SHE HAD
SEEN ME OCCASIONALLY WALKING IN THAT ALLEY WITH M
PAUL AND I DOUBT
NOT CONSIDERED IT MY DUTY TO JOIN HIM NOW WET AS IT WAS
SHE MADE SUCH A BUSTLE THAT M
PAUL AT LAST LOOKED UP AND OF COURSE
PERCEIVED WHY AND AT WHOM SHE BARKED
HE WHISTLED TO CALL HER OFF SHE
ONLY BARKED THE LOUDER
SHE SEEMED QUITE BENT UPON HAVING THE GLASS
DOOR OPENED
TIRED I SUPPOSE WITH HER IMPORTUNITY HE THREW DOWN HIS
SPADE APPROACHED AND PUSHED THE DOOR AJAR
SYLVIE BURST IN ALL
IMPETUOUS SPRANG TO MY LAP AND WITH HER PAWS AT MY NECK AND HER
LITTLE NOSE AND TONGUE SOMEWHAT OVERPOWERINGLY BUSY ABOUT MY FACE
MOUTH AND EYES FLOURISHED HER BUSHY TAIL OVER THE DESK AND SCATTERED
BOOKS AND PAPERS FAR AND WIDE
M
EMANUEL ADVANCED TO STILL THE CLAMOUR AND REPAIR THE DISARRANGEMENT
HAVING GATHERED UP THE BOOKS HE CAPTURED SYLVIE AND STOWED HER AWAY
UNDER HIS PALETT WHERE SHE NESTLED AS QUIET AS A MOUSE HER HEAD JUST
PEEPING FORTH
SHE WAS VERY TINY AND HAD THE PRETTIEST LITTLE INNOCENT
FACE THE SILKIEST LONG EARS THE FINEST DARK EYES IN THE WORLD
I
NEVER SAW HER BUT I THOUGHT OF PAULINA DE BASSOMPIERRE FORGIVE THE
ASSOCIATION READER IT WOULD OCCUR
M
PAUL PETTED AND PATTED HER THE ENDEARMENTS SHE RECEIVED WERE NOT TO
BE WONDERED AT SHE INVITED AFFECTION BY HER BEAUTY AND HER VIVACIOUS
LIFE
WHILE CARESSING THE SPANIEL HIS EYE ROVED OVER THE PAPERS AND BOOKS
JUST REPLACED IT SETTLED ON THE RELIGIOUS TRACT
HIS LIPS MOVED HE
HALF CHECKED THE IMPULSE TO SPEAK
WHAT HAD HE PROMISED NEVER TO
ADDRESS ME MORE IF SO HIS BETTER NATURE PRONOUNCED THE VOW MORE
HONOURED IN THE BREACH THAN IN THE OBSERVANCE FOR WITH A SECOND
EFFORT HE SPOKE YOU HAVE NOT YET READ THE BROCHURE I PRESUME IT
IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY INVITING
I REPLIED THAT I HAD READ IT
HE WAITED AS IF WISHING ME TO GIVE AN OPINION UPON IT UNASKED
UNASKED HOWEVER I WAS IN NO MOOD TO DO OR SAY ANYTHING
IF ANY
CONCESSIONS WERE TO BE MADE IF ANY ADVANCES WERE DEMANDED THAT WAS
THE AFFAIR OF THE VERY DOCILE PUPIL OF PRE SILAS NOT MINE
HIS EYE
SETTLED UPON ME GENTLY THERE WAS MILDNESS AT THE MOMENT IN ITS BLUE
RAY THERE WAS SOLICITUDE A SHADE OF PATHOS THERE WERE MEANINGS
COMPOSITE AND CONTRASTED REPROACH MELTING INTO REMORSE
AT THE MOMENT
PROBABLY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO SEE SOMETHING EMOTIONAL IN ME
I
COULD NOT SHOW IT
IN ANOTHER MINUTE HOWEVER I SHOULD HAVE BETRAYED
CONFUSION HAD I NOT BETHOUGHT MYSELF TO TAKE SOME QUILL PENS FROM MY
DESK AND BEGIN SOBERLY TO MEND THEM
I KNEW THAT ACTION WOULD GIVE A TURN TO HIS MOOD
HE NEVER LIKED TO SEE
ME MEND PENS MY KNIFE WAS ALWAYS DULL EDGED MY HAND TOO WAS
UNSKILFUL I HACKED AND CHIPPED
ON THIS OCCASION I CUT MY OWN
FINGER HALF ON PURPOSE
I WANTED TO RESTORE HIM TO HIS NATURAL STATE
TO SET HIM AT HIS EASE TO GET HIM TO CHIDE
MALADROIT HE CRIED AT LAST SHE WILL MAKE MINCEMEAT OF HER HANDS
HE PUT SYLVIE DOWN MAKING HER LIE QUIET BESIDE HIS BONNET GREC AND
DEPRIVING ME OF THE PENS AND PENKNIFE PROCEEDED TO SLICE NIB AND
POINT WITH THE ACCURACY AND CELERITY OF A MACHINE
DID I LIKE THE LITTLE BOOK HE NOW INQUIRED
SUPPRESSING A YAWN I SAID I HARDLY KNEW
HAD IT MOVED ME
I THOUGHT IT HAD MADE ME A LITTLE SLEEPY
AFTER A PAUSE ALLONS DONC IT WAS OF NO USE TAKING THAT TONE WITH
HIM
BAD AS I WAS AND HE SHOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE TO NAME ALL MY FAULTS
AT A BREATH GOD AND NATURE HAD GIVEN ME 'TROP DE SENSIBILIT ET DE
SYMPATHIE' NOT TO BE PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED BY AN APPEAL SO TOUCHING
INDEED I RESPONDED ROUSING MYSELF QUICKLY I WAS NOT AFFECTED AT
ALL NOT A WHIT
AND IN PROOF I DREW FROM MY POCKET A PERFECTLY DRY HANDKERCHIEF STILL
CLEAN AND IN ITS FOLDS
HEREUPON I WAS MADE THE OBJECT OF A STRING OF STRICTURES RATHER PIQUANT
THAN POLITE
I LISTENED WITH ZEST
AFTER THOSE TWO DAYS OF UNNATURAL
SILENCE IT WAS BETTER THAN MUSIC TO HEAR M
PAUL HARANGUING AGAIN JUST
IN HIS OLD FASHION
I LISTENED AND MEANTIME SOLACED MYSELF AND SYLVIE
WITH THE CONTENTS OF A BONBONNIRE WHICH M
EMANUEL'S GIFTS KEPT WELL
SUPPLIED WITH CHOCOLATE COMFITS IT PLEASED HIM TO SEE EVEN A SMALL
MATTER FROM HIS HAND DULY APPRECIATED
HE LOOKED AT ME AND THE SPANIEL
WHILE WE SHARED THE SPOIL HE PUT UP HIS PENKNIFE
TOUCHING MY HAND
WITH THE BUNDLE OF NEW CUT QUILLS HE SAID DITES DONC PETITE
SOEUR SPEAK FRANKLY WHAT HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ME DURING THE LAST TWO
DAYS
BUT OF THIS QUESTION I WOULD TAKE NO MANNER OF NOTICE ITS PURPORT MADE
MY EYES FILL
I CARESSED SYLVIE ASSIDUOUSLY
M
PAUL LEANING OVER THE
DESK BENT TOWARDS ME I CALLED MYSELF YOUR BROTHER HE SAID I
HARDLY KNOW WHAT I AM BROTHER FRIEND I CANNOT TELL
I KNOW I THINK
OF YOU I FEEL I WISH YOU WELL BUT I MUST CHECK MYSELF YOU ARE TO BE
FEARED
MY BEST FRIENDS POINT OUT DANGER AND WHISPER CAUTION
YOU DO RIGHT TO LISTEN TO YOUR FRIENDS
BY ALL MEANS BE CAUTIOUS
IT IS YOUR RELIGION YOUR STRANGE SELF RELIANT INVULNERABLE CREED
WHOSE INFLUENCE SEEMS TO CLOTHE YOU IN I KNOW NOT WHAT UNBLESSED
PANOPLY
YOU ARE GOOD PRE SILAS CALLS YOU GOOD AND LOVES YOU BUT
YOUR TERRIBLE PROUD EARNEST PROTESTANTISM THERE IS THE DANGER
IT
EXPRESSES ITSELF BY YOUR EYE AT TIMES AND AGAIN IT GIVES YOU CERTAIN
TONES AND CERTAIN GESTURES THAT MAKE MY FLESH CREEP
YOU ARE NOT
DEMONSTRATIVE AND YET JUST NOW WHEN YOU HANDLED THAT TRACT MY GOD
I THOUGHT LUCIFER SMILED
CERTAINLY I DON'T RESPECT THAT TRACT WHAT THEN
NOT RESPECT THAT TRACT BUT IT IS THE PURE ESSENCE OF FAITH LOVE
CHARITY I THOUGHT IT WOULD TOUCH YOU IN ITS GENTLENESS I TRUSTED
THAT IT COULD NOT FAIL
I LAID IT IN YOUR DESK WITH A PRAYER I MUST
INDEED BE A SINNER HEAVEN WILL NOT HEAR THE PETITIONS THAT COME
WARMEST FROM MY HEART
YOU SCORN MY LITTLE OFFERING
OH CELA ME FAIT
MAL
MONSIEUR I DON'T SCORN IT AT LEAST NOT AS YOUR GIFT
MONSIEUR SIT
DOWN LISTEN TO ME
I AM NOT A HEATHEN I AM NOT HARD HEARTED I AM NOT
UNCHRISTIAN I AM NOT DANGEROUS AS THEY TELL YOU I WOULD NOT TROUBLE
YOUR FAITH YOU BELIEVE IN GOD AND CHRIST AND THE BIBLE AND SO DO I
BUT DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE BIBLE DO YOU RECEIVE REVELATION WHAT
LIMITS ARE THERE TO THE WILD CARELESS DARING OF YOUR COUNTRY AND SECT
PRE SILAS DROPPED DARK HINTS
BY DINT OF PERSUASION I MADE HIM HALF DEFINE THESE HINTS THEY
AMOUNTED TO CRAFTY JESUIT SLANDERS
THAT NIGHT M
PAUL AND I TALKED
SERIOUSLY AND CLOSELY
HE PLEADED HE ARGUED
I COULD NOT ARGUE A
FORTUNATE INCAPACITY IT NEEDED BUT TRIUMPHANT LOGICAL OPPOSITION TO
EFFECT ALL THE DIRECTOR WISHED TO BE EFFECTED BUT I COULD TALK IN MY
OWN WAY THE WAY M
PAUL WAS USED TO AND OF WHICH HE COULD FOLLOW THE
MEANDERINGS AND FILL THE HIATUS AND PARDON THE STRANGE STAMMERINGS
STRANGE TO HIM NO LONGER
AT EASE WITH HIM I COULD DEFEND MY CREED AND
FAITH IN MY OWN FASHION IN SOME DEGREE I COULD LULL HIS PREJUDICES
HE
WAS NOT SATISFIED WHEN HE WENT AWAY HARDLY WAS HE APPEASED BUT HE WAS
MADE THOROUGHLY TO FEEL THAT PROTESTANTS WERE NOT NECESSARILY THE
IRREVERENT PAGANS HIS DIRECTOR HAD INSINUATED HE WAS MADE TO
COMPREHEND SOMETHING OF THEIR MODE OF HONOURING THE LIGHT THE LIFE
THE WORD HE WAS ENABLED PARTLY TO PERCEIVE THAT WHILE THEIR
VENERATION FOR THINGS VENERABLE WAS NOT QUITE LIKE THAT CULTIVATED IN
HIS CHURCH IT HAD ITS OWN PERHAPS DEEPER POWER ITS OWN MORE SOLEMN
AWE
I FOUND THAT PRE SILAS HIMSELF I MUST REPEAT NOT A BAD MAN THOUGH
THE ADVOCATE OF A BAD CAUSE HAD DARKLY STIGMATIZED PROTESTANTS IN
GENERAL AND MYSELF BY INFERENCE WITH STRANGE NAMES HAD ASCRIBED TO
US STRANGE ISMS MONSIEUR EMANUEL REVEALED ALL THIS IN HIS FRANK
FASHION WHICH KNEW NOT SECRETIVENESS LOOKING AT ME AS HE SPOKE WITH A
KIND EARNEST FEAR ALMOST TREMBLING LEST THERE SHOULD BE TRUTH IN THE
CHARGES
PRE SILAS IT SEEMS HAD CLOSELY WATCHED ME HAD ASCERTAINED
THAT I WENT BY TURNS AND INDISCRIMINATELY TO THE THREE PROTESTANT
CHAPELS OF VILLETTE THE FRENCH GERMAN AND ENGLISH ID EST THE
PRESBYTERIAN LUTHERAN EPISCOPALIAN
SUCH LIBERALITY ARGUED IN THE
FATHER'S EYES PROFOUND INDIFFERENCE WHO TOLERATES ALL HE REASONED
CAN BE ATTACHED TO NONE
NOW IT HAPPENED THAT I HAD OFTEN SECRETLY
WONDERED AT THE MINUTE AND UNIMPORTANT CHARACTER OF THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THESE THREE SECTS AT THE UNITY AND IDENTITY OF THEIR VITAL
DOCTRINES I SAW NOTHING TO HINDER THEM FROM BEING ONE DAY FUSED INTO
ONE GRAND HOLY ALLIANCE AND I RESPECTED THEM ALL THOUGH I THOUGHT
THAT IN EACH THERE WERE FAULTS OF FORM INCUMBRANCES AND TRIVIALITIES
JUST WHAT I THOUGHT THAT DID I TELL M
EMANUEL AND EXPLAINED TO HIM
THAT MY OWN LAST APPEAL THE GUIDE TO WHICH I LOOKED AND THE TEACHER
WHICH I OWNED MUST ALWAYS BE THE BIBLE ITSELF RATHER THAN ANY SECT
OF WHATEVER NAME OR NATION
HE LEFT ME SOOTHED YET FULL OF SOLICITUDE BREATHING A WISH AS STRONG
AS A PRAYER THAT IF I WERE WRONG HEAVEN WOULD LEAD ME RIGHT
I HEARD
POURED FORTH ON THE THRESHOLD SOME FERVID MURMURINGS TO MARIE REINE
DU CIEL SOME DEEP ASPIRATION THAT HIS HOPE MIGHT YET BE MINE
STRANGE I HAD NO SUCH FEVERISH WISH TO TURN HIM FROM THE FAITH OF HIS
FATHERS
I THOUGHT ROMANISM WRONG A GREAT MIXED IMAGE OF GOLD AND
CLAY BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THIS ROMANIST HELD THE PURER ELEMENTS
OF HIS CREED WITH AN INNOCENCY OF HEART WHICH GOD MUST LOVE
THE PRECEDING CONVERSATION PASSED BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE O'CLOCK OF THE
EVENING IN A SCHOOLROOM OF THE QUIET RUE FOSSETTE OPENING ON A
SEQUESTERED GARDEN
PROBABLY ABOUT THE SAME OR A SOMEWHAT LATER HOUR
OF THE SUCCEEDING EVENING ITS ECHOES COLLECTED BY HOLY OBEDIENCE
WERE BREATHED VERBATIM IN AN ATTENT EAR AT THE PANEL OF A
CONFESSIONAL IN THE HOARY CHURCH OF THE MAGI
IT ENSUED THAT PRE
SILAS PAID A VISIT TO MADAME BECK AND STIRRED BY I KNOW NOT WHAT
MIXTURE OF MOTIVES PERSUADED HER TO LET HIM UNDERTAKE FOR A TIME THE
ENGLISHWOMAN'S SPIRITUAL DIRECTION
HEREUPON I WAS PUT THROUGH A COURSE OF READING THAT IS I JUST GLANCED
AT THE BOOKS LENT ME THEY WERE TOO LITTLE IN MY WAY TO BE THOROUGHLY
READ MARKED LEARNED OR INWARDLY DIGESTED
AND BESIDES I HAD A BOOK
UP STAIRS UNDER MY PILLOW WHEREOF CERTAIN CHAPTERS SATISFIED MY NEEDS
IN THE ARTICLE OF SPIRITUAL LORE FURNISHING SUCH PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE
AS TO MY HEART'S CORE I WAS CONVINCED COULD NOT BE IMPROVED ON
THEN PRE SILAS SHOWED ME THE FAIR SIDE OF ROME HER GOOD WORKS AND
BADE ME JUDGE THE TREE BY ITS FRUITS
IN ANSWER I FELT AND I AVOWED THAT THESE WORKS WERE NOT THE FRUITS
OF ROME THEY WERE BUT HER ABUNDANT BLOSSOMING BUT THE FAIR PROMISE
SHE SHOWED THE WORLD THAT BLOOM WHEN SET SAVOURED NOT OF CHARITY
THE APPLE FULL FORMED WAS IGNORANCE ABASEMENT AND BIGOTRY
OUT OF
MEN'S AFFLICTIONS AND AFFECTIONS WERE FORGED THE RIVETS OF THEIR
SERVITUDE
POVERTY WAS FED AND CLOTHED AND SHELTERED TO BIND IT BY
OBLIGATION TO THE CHURCH ORPHANAGE WAS REARED AND EDUCATED THAT IT
MIGHT GROW UP IN THE FOLD OF THE CHURCH SICKNESS WAS TENDED THAT IT
MIGHT DIE AFTER THE FORMULA AND IN THE ORDINANCE OF THE CHURCH AND
MEN WERE OVERWROUGHT AND WOMEN MOST MURDEROUSLY SACRIFICED AND ALL
LAID DOWN A WORLD GOD MADE PLEASANT FOR HIS CREATURES' GOOD AND TOOK
UP A CROSS MONSTROUS IN ITS GALLING WEIGHT THAT THEY MIGHT SERVE
ROME PROVE HER SANCTITY CONFIRM HER POWER AND SPREAD THE REIGN OF
HER TYRANT CHURCH
FOR MAN'S GOOD WAS LITTLE DONE FOR GOD'S GLORY LESS
A THOUSAND WAYS
WERE OPENED WITH PAIN WITH BLOOD SWEATS WITH LAVISHING OF LIFE
MOUNTAINS WERE CLOVEN THROUGH THEIR BREASTS AND ROCKS WERE SPLIT TO
THEIR BASE AND ALL FOR WHAT THAT A PRIESTHOOD MIGHT MARCH STRAIGHT ON
AND STRAIGHT UPWARD TO AN ALL DOMINATING EMINENCE WHENCE THEY MIGHT AT
LAST STRETCH THE SCEPTRE OF THEIR MOLOCH CHURCH
IT WILL NOT BE
GOD IS NOT WITH ROME AND WERE HUMAN SORROWS STILL FOR
THE SON OF GOD WOULD HE NOT MOURN OVER HER CRUELTIES AND AMBITIONS AS
ONCE HE MOURNED OVER THE CRIMES AND WOES OF DOOMED JERUSALEM
OH LOVERS OF POWER OH MITRED ASPIRANTS FOR THIS WORLD'S KINGDOMS AN
HOUR WILL COME EVEN TO YOU WHEN IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOUR
HEARTS PAUSING FAINT AT EACH BROKEN BEAT THAT THERE IS A MERCY BEYOND
HUMAN COMPASSIONS A LOVE STRONGER THAN THIS STRONG DEATH WHICH EVEN
YOU MUST FACE AND BEFORE IT FALL A CHARITY MORE POTENT THAN ANY SIN
EVEN YOURS A PITY WHICH REDEEMS WORLDS NAY ABSOLVES PRIESTS
MY THIRD TEMPTATION WAS HELD OUT IN THE POMP OF ROME THE GLORY OF HER
KINGDOM
I WAS TAKEN TO THE CHURCHES ON SOLEMN OCCASIONS DAYS OF FTE
AND STATE I WAS SHOWN THE PAPAL RITUAL AND CEREMONIAL
I LOOKED AT IT
MANY PEOPLE MEN AND WOMEN NO DOUBT FAR MY SUPERIORS IN A THOUSAND
WAYS HAVE FELT THIS DISPLAY IMPRESSIVE HAVE DECLARED THAT THOUGH
THEIR REASON PROTESTED THEIR IMAGINATION WAS SUBJUGATED
I CANNOT SAY
THE SAME
NEITHER FULL PROCESSION NOR HIGH MASS NOR SWARMING TAPERS
NOR SWINGING CENSERS NOR ECCLESIASTICAL MILLINERY NOR CELESTIAL
JEWELLERY TOUCHED MY IMAGINATION A WHIT
WHAT I SAW STRUCK ME AS
TAWDRY NOT GRAND AS GROSSLY MATERIAL NOT POETICALLY SPIRITUAL
THIS I DID NOT TELL PRE SILAS HE WAS OLD HE LOOKED VENERABLE
THROUGH EVERY ABORTIVE EXPERIMENT UNDER EVERY REPEATED DISAPPOINTMENT
HE REMAINED PERSONALLY KIND TO ME AND I FELT TENDER OF HURTING HIS
FEELINGS
BUT ON THE EVENING OF A CERTAIN DAY WHEN FROM THE BALCONY OF
A GREAT HOUSE I HAD BEEN MADE TO WITNESS A HUGE MINGLED PROCESSION OF
THE CHURCH AND THE ARMY PRIESTS WITH RELICS AND SOLDIERS WITH
WEAPONS AN OBESE AND AGED ARCHBISHOP HABITED IN CAMBRIC AND LACE
LOOKING STRANGELY LIKE A GREY DAW IN BIRD OF PARADISE PLUMAGE AND A
BAND OF YOUNG GIRLS FANTASTICALLY ROBED AND GARLANDED THEN I SPOKE
MY MIND TO M
PAUL
I DID NOT LIKE IT I TOLD HIM I DID NOT RESPECT SUCH CEREMONIES I
WISHED TO SEE NO MORE
AND HAVING RELIEVED MY CONSCIENCE BY THIS DECLARATION I WAS ABLE TO GO
ON AND SPEAKING MORE CURRENTLY AND CLEARLY THAN MY WONT TO SHOW HIM
THAT I HAD A MIND TO KEEP TO MY REFORMED CREED THE MORE I SAW OF
POPERY THE CLOSER I CLUNG TO PROTESTANTISM DOUBTLESS THERE WERE ERRORS
IN EVERY CHURCH BUT I NOW PERCEIVED BY CONTRAST HOW SEVERELY PURE WAS
MY OWN COMPARED WITH HER WHOSE PAINTED AND MERETRICIOUS FACE HAD BEEN
UNVEILED FOR MY ADMIRATION
I TOLD HIM HOW WE KEPT FEWER FORMS BETWEEN
US AND GOD RETAINING INDEED NO MORE THAN PERHAPS THE NATURE OF
MANKIND IN THE MASS RENDERED NECESSARY FOR DUE OBSERVANCE
I TOLD HIM I
COULD NOT LOOK ON FLOWERS AND TINSEL ON WAX LIGHTS AND EMBROIDERY AT
SUCH TIMES AND UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO LIFTING
THE SECRET VISION TO HIM WHOSE HOME IS INFINITY AND HIS
BEING ETERNITY
THAT WHEN I THOUGHT OF SIN AND SORROW OF EARTHLY
CORRUPTION MORTAL DEPRAVITY WEIGHTY TEMPORAL WOE I COULD NOT CARE
FOR CHANTING PRIESTS OR MUMMING OFFICIALS THAT WHEN THE PAINS OF
EXISTENCE AND THE TERRORS OF DISSOLUTION PRESSED BEFORE ME WHEN THE
MIGHTY HOPE AND MEASURELESS DOUBT OF THE FUTURE AROSE IN VIEW THEN
EVEN THE SCIENTIFIC STRAIN OR THE PRAYER IN A LANGUAGE LEARNED AND
DEAD HARASSED WITH HINDRANCE A HEART WHICH ONLY LONGED TO CRY GOD
BE MERCIFUL TO ME A SINNER
WHEN I HAD SO SPOKEN SO DECLARED MY FAITH AND SO WIDELY SEVERED
MYSELF FROM HIM I ADDRESSED THEN AT LAST CAME A TONE ACCORDANT AN
ECHO RESPONSIVE ONE SWEET CHORD OF HARMONY IN TWO CONFLICTING SPIRITS
WHATEVER SAY PRIESTS OR CONTROVERSIALISTS MURMURED M
EMANUEL GOD
IS GOOD AND LOVES ALL THE SINCERE
BELIEVE THEN WHAT YOU CAN
BELIEVE IT AS YOU CAN ONE PRAYER AT LEAST WE HAVE IN COMMON I ALSO
CRY 'O DIEU SOIS APPAIS ENVERS MOI QUI SUIS PCHEUR
HE LEANED ON THE BACK OF MY CHAIR
AFTER SOME THOUGHT HE AGAIN SPOKE
HOW SEEM IN THE EYES OF THAT GOD WHO MADE ALL FIRMAMENTS FROM WHOSE
NOSTRILS ISSUED WHATEVER OF LIFE IS HERE OR IN THE STARS SHINING
YONDER HOW SEEM THE DIFFERENCES OF MAN BUT AS TIME IS NOT FOR GOD
NOR SPACE SO NEITHER IS MEASURE NOR COMPARISON
WE ABASE OURSELVES IN
OUR LITTLENESS AND WE DO RIGHT YET IT MAY BE THAT THE CONSTANCY OF
ONE HEART THE TRUTH AND FAITH OF ONE MIND ACCORDING TO THE LIGHT HE
HAS APPOINTED IMPORT AS MUCH TO HIM AS THE JUST MOTION OF SATELLITES
ABOUT THEIR PLANETS OF PLANETS ABOUT THEIR SUNS OF SUNS AROUND THAT
MIGHTY UNSEEN CENTRE INCOMPREHENSIBLE IRREALIZABLE WITH STRANGE
MENTAL EFFORT ONLY DIVINED
GOD GUIDE US ALL GOD BLESS YOU LUCY
CHAPTER XXXVII
SUNSHINE
IT WAS VERY WELL FOR PAULINA TO DECLINE FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE WITH
GRAHAM TILL HER FATHER HAD SANCTIONED THE INTERCOURSE
BUT DR
BRETTON
COULD NOT LIVE WITHIN A LEAGUE OF THE HTEL CRCY AND NOT CONTRIVE TO
VISIT THERE OFTEN
BOTH LOVERS MEANT AT FIRST I BELIEVE TO BE
DISTANT THEY KEPT THEIR INTENTION SO FAR AS DEMONSTRATIVE COURTSHIP
WENT BUT IN FEELING THEY SOON DREW VERY NEAR
ALL THAT WAS BEST IN GRAHAM SOUGHT PAULINA WHATEVER IN HIM WAS NOBLE
AWOKE AND GREW IN HER PRESENCE
WITH HIS PAST ADMIRATION OF MISS
FANSHAWE I SUPPOSE HIS INTELLECT HAD LITTLE TO DO BUT HIS WHOLE
INTELLECT AND HIS HIGHEST TASTES CAME IN QUESTION NOW
THESE LIKE
ALL HIS FACULTIES WERE ACTIVE EAGER FOR NUTRIMENT AND ALIVE TO
GRATIFICATION WHEN IT CAME
I CANNOT SAY THAT PAULINA DESIGNEDLY LED HIM TO TALK OF BOOKS OR
FORMALLY PROPOSED TO HERSELF FOR A MOMENT THE TASK OF WINNING HIM TO
REFLECTION OR PLANNED THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIS MIND OR SO MUCH AS
FANCIED HIS MIND COULD IN ANY ONE RESPECT BE IMPROVED
SHE THOUGHT HIM
VERY PERFECT IT WAS GRAHAM HIMSELF WHO AT FIRST BY THE MEREST
CHANCE MENTIONED SOME BOOK HE HAD BEEN READING AND WHEN IN HER
RESPONSE SOUNDED A WELCOME HARMONY OF SYMPATHIES SOMETHING PLEASANT
TO HIS SOUL HE TALKED ON MORE AND BETTER PERHAPS THAN HE HAD EVER
TALKED BEFORE ON SUCH SUBJECTS
SHE LISTENED WITH DELIGHT AND ANSWERED
WITH ANIMATION
IN EACH SUCCESSIVE ANSWER GRAHAM HEARD A MUSIC WAXING
FINER AND FINER TO HIS SENSE IN EACH HE FOUND A SUGGESTIVE
PERSUASIVE MAGIC ACCENT THAT OPENED A SCARCE KNOWN TREASURE HOUSE
WITHIN SHOWED HIM UNSUSPECTED POWER IN HIS OWN MIND AND WHAT WAS
BETTER LATENT GOODNESS IN HIS HEART
EACH LIKED THE WAY IN WHICH THE
OTHER TALKED THE VOICE THE DICTION THE EXPRESSION PLEASED EACH
KEENLY RELISHED THE FLAVOUR OF THE OTHER'S WIT THEY MET EACH OTHER'S
MEANING WITH STRANGE QUICKNESS THEIR THOUGHTS OFTEN MATCHED LIKE
CAREFULLY CHOSEN PEARLS
GRAHAM HAD WEALTH OF MIRTH BY NATURE PAULINA
POSSESSED NO SUCH INHERENT FLOW OF ANIMAL SPIRITS UNSTIMULATED SHE
INCLINED TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND PENSIVE BUT NOW SHE SEEMED MERRY AS A
LARK IN HER LOVER'S GENIAL PRESENCE SHE GLANCED LIKE SOME SOFT GLAD
LIGHT
HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE GREW IN HER HAPPINESS I CAN HARDLY EXPRESS
BUT I WONDERED TO SEE HER
AS TO THAT GENTLE ICE OF HERS THAT RESERVE
ON WHICH SHE HAD DEPENDED WHERE WAS IT NOW AH GRAHAM WOULD NOT LONG
BEAR IT HE BROUGHT WITH HIM A GENEROUS INFLUENCE THAT SOON THAWED THE
TIMID SELF IMPOSED RESTRICTION
NOW WERE THE OLD BRETTON DAYS TALKED OVER PERHAPS BROKENLY AT FIRST
WITH A SORT OF SMILING DIFFIDENCE THEN WITH OPENING CANDOUR AND STILL
GROWING CONFIDENCE
GRAHAM HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF A BETTER OPPORTUNITY
THAN THAT HE HAD WISHED ME TO GIVE HE HAD EARNED INDEPENDENCE OF THE
COLLATERAL HELP THAT DISOBLIGING LUCY HAD REFUSED ALL HIS
REMINISCENCES OF LITTLE POLLY FOUND THEIR PROPER EXPRESSION IN HIS
OWN PLEASANT TONES BY HIS OWN KIND AND HANDSOME LIPS HOW MUCH BETTER
THAN IF SUGGESTED BY ME
MORE THAN ONCE WHEN WE WERE ALONE PAULINA WOULD TELL ME HOW WONDERFUL
AND CURIOUS IT WAS TO DISCOVER THE RICHNESS AND ACCURACY OF HIS MEMORY
IN THIS MATTER
HOW WHILE HE WAS LOOKING AT HER RECOLLECTIONS WOULD
SEEM TO BE SUDDENLY QUICKENED IN HIS MIND
HE REMINDED HER THAT SHE HAD
ONCE GATHERED HIS HEAD IN HER ARMS CARESSED HIS LEONINE GRACES AND
CRIED OUT GRAHAM I DO LIKE YOU HE TOLD HER HOW SHE WOULD SET A
FOOTSTOOL BESIDE HIM AND CLIMB BY ITS AID TO HIS KNEE
AT THIS DAY HE
SAID HE COULD RECALL THE SENSATION OF HER LITTLE HANDS SMOOTHING HIS
CHEEK OR BURYING THEMSELVES IN HIS THICK MANE
HE REMEMBERED THE TOUCH
OF HER SMALL FOREFINGER PLACED HALF TREMBLINGLY HALF CURIOUSLY IN
THE CLEFT IN HIS CHIN THE LISP THE LOOK WITH WHICH SHE WOULD NAME IT
A PRETTY DIMPLE THEN SEEK HIS EYES AND QUESTION WHY THEY PIERCED SO
TELLING HIM HE HAD A NICE STRANGE FACE FAR NICER FAR STRANGER THAN
EITHER HIS MAMMA OR LUCY SNOWE
CHILD AS I WAS REMARKED PAULINA I WONDER HOW I DARED BE SO
VENTUROUS
TO ME HE SEEMS NOW ALL SACRED HIS LOCKS ARE INACCESSIBLE
AND LUCY I FEEL A SORT OF FEAR WHEN I LOOK AT HIS FIRM MARBLE CHIN
AT HIS STRAIGHT GREEK FEATURES
WOMEN ARE CALLED BEAUTIFUL LUCY HE IS
NOT LIKE A WOMAN THEREFORE I SUPPOSE HE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT WHAT IS
HE THEN DO OTHER PEOPLE SEE HIM WITH MY EYES DO YOU ADMIRE HIM
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DO PAULINA WAS ONCE MY ANSWER TO HER MANY
QUESTIONS
I NEVER SEE HIM
I LOOKED AT HIM TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT A
YEAR AGO BEFORE HE RECOGNISED ME AND THEN I SHUT MY EYES AND IF HE
WERE TO CROSS THEIR BALLS TWELVE TIMES BETWEEN EACH DAY'S SUNSET AND
SUNRISE EXCEPT FROM MEMORY I SHOULD HARDLY KNOW WHAT SHAPE HAD GONE
BY
LUCY WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID SHE UNDER HER BREATH
I MEAN THAT I VALUE VISION AND DREAD BEING STRUCK STONE BLIND
IT WAS BEST TO ANSWER HER STRONGLY AT ONCE AND TO SILENCE FOR EVER THE
TENDER PASSIONATE CONFIDENCES WHICH LEFT HER LIPS SWEET HONEY AND
SOMETIMES DROPPED IN MY EAR MOLTEN LEAD
TO ME SHE COMMENTED NO MORE
ON HER LOVER'S BEAUTY
YET SPEAK OF HIM SHE WOULD SOMETIMES SHYLY IN QUIET BRIEF PHRASES
SOMETIMES WITH A TENDERNESS OF CADENCE AND MUSIC OF VOICE EXQUISITE IN
ITSELF BUT WHICH CHAFED ME AT TIMES MISERABLY AND THEN I KNOW I
GAVE HER STERN LOOKS AND WORDS BUT CLOUDLESS HAPPINESS HAD DAZZLED HER
NATIVE CLEAR SIGHT AND SHE ONLY THOUGHT LUCY FITFUL
SPARTAN GIRL PROUD LUCY SHE WOULD SAY SMILING AT ME
GRAHAM SAYS
YOU ARE THE MOST PECULIAR CAPRICIOUS LITTLE WOMAN HE KNOWS BUT YET
YOU ARE EXCELLENT WE BOTH THINK SO
YOU BOTH THINK YOU KNOW NOT WHAT SAID I
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO MAKE
ME AS LITTLE THE SUBJECT OF YOUR MUTUAL TALK AND THOUGHTS AS POSSIBLE
I HAVE MY SORT OF LIFE APART FROM YOURS
BUT OURS LUCY IS A BEAUTIFUL LIFE OR IT WILL BE AND YOU SHALL
SHARE IT
I SHALL SHARE NO MAN'S OR WOMAN'S LIFE IN THIS WORLD AS YOU
UNDERSTAND SHARING
I THINK I HAVE ONE FRIEND OF MY OWN BUT AM NOT
SURE AND TILL I AM SURE I LIVE SOLITARY
BUT SOLITUDE IS SADNESS
YES IT IS SADNESS
LIFE HOWEVER HAS WORSE THAN THAT
DEEPER THAN
MELANCHOLY LIES HEART BREAK
LUCY I WONDER IF ANYBODY WILL EVER COMPREHEND YOU ALTOGETHER
THERE IS IN LOVERS A CERTAIN INFATUATION OF EGOTISM THEY WILL HAVE A
WITNESS OF THEIR HAPPINESS COST THAT WITNESS WHAT IT MAY
PAULINA HAD
FORBIDDEN LETTERS YET DR
BRETTON WROTE SHE HAD RESOLVED AGAINST
CORRESPONDENCE YET SHE ANSWERED WERE IT ONLY TO CHIDE
SHE SHOWED ME
THESE LETTERS WITH SOMETHING OF THE SPOILED CHILD'S WILFULNESS AND OF
THE HEIRESS'S IMPERIOUSNESS SHE MADE ME READ THEM
AS I READ
GRAHAM'S I SCARCE WONDERED AT HER EXACTION AND UNDERSTOOD HER PRIDE
THEY WERE FINE LETTERS MANLY AND FOND MODEST AND GALLANT
HERS MUST
HAVE APPEARED TO HIM BEAUTIFUL
THEY HAD NOT BEEN WRITTEN TO SHOW HER
TALENTS STILL LESS I THINK TO EXPRESS HER LOVE
ON THE CONTRARY IT
APPEARED THAT SHE HAD PROPOSED TO HERSELF THE TASK OF HIDING THAT
FEELING AND BRIDLING HER LOVER'S ARDOUR
BUT HOW COULD SUCH LETTERS
SERVE SUCH A PURPOSE GRAHAM WAS BECOME DEAR AS HER LIFE HE DREW HER
LIKE A POWERFUL MAGNET
FOR HER THERE WAS INFLUENCE UNSPEAKABLE IN ALL
HE UTTERED WROTE THOUGHT OR LOOKED
WITH THIS UNCONFESSED
CONFESSION HER LETTERS GLOWED IT KINDLED THEM FROM GREETING TO ADIEU
I WISH PAPA KNEW I DO WISH PAPA KNEW BEGAN NOW TO BE HER ANXIOUS
MURMUR
I WISH AND YET I FEAR
I CAN HARDLY KEEP GRAHAM BACK FROM
TELLING HIM
THERE IS NOTHING I LONG FOR MORE THAN TO HAVE THIS AFFAIR
SETTLED TO SPEAK OUT CANDIDLY AND YET I DREAD THE CRISIS
I KNOW I
AM CERTAIN PAPA WILL BE ANGRY AT THE FIRST I FEAR HE WILL DISLIKE ME
ALMOST IT WILL SEEM TO HIM AN UNTOWARD BUSINESS IT WILL BE A
SURPRISE A SHOCK I CAN HARDLY FORESEE ITS WHOLE EFFECT ON HIM
THE FACT WAS HER FATHER LONG CALM WAS BEGINNING TO BE A LITTLE
STIRRED LONG BLIND ON ONE POINT AN IMPORTUNATE LIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO
TRESPASS ON HIS EYE
TO HER HE SAID NOTHING BUT WHEN SHE WAS NOT LOOKING AT OR PERHAPS
THINKING OF HIM I SAW HIM GAZE AND MEDITATE ON HER
ONE EVENING PAULINA WAS IN HER DRESSING ROOM WRITING I BELIEVE TO
GRAHAM SHE HAD LEFT ME IN THE LIBRARY READING M
DE BASSOMPIERRE
CAME IN HE SAT DOWN I WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW HE REQUESTED ME TO
REMAIN GENTLY YET IN A MANNER WHICH SHOWED HE WISHED COMPLIANCE
HE
HAD TAKEN HIS SEAT NEAR THE WINDOW AT A DISTANCE FROM ME HE OPENED A
DESK HE TOOK FROM IT WHAT LOOKED LIKE A MEMORANDUM BOOK OF THIS BOOK
HE STUDIED A CERTAIN ENTRY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
MISS SNOWE SAID HE LAYING IT DOWN DO YOU KNOW MY LITTLE GIRL'S
AGE
ABOUT EIGHTEEN IS IT NOT SIR
IT SEEMS SO
THIS OLD POCKET BOOK TELLS ME SHE WAS BORN ON THE 5TH OF
MAY IN THE YEAR 18 EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO
IT IS STRANGE I HAD LOST
THE JUST RECKONING OF HER AGE
I THOUGHT OF HER AS TWELVE FOURTEEN AN
INDEFINITE DATE BUT SHE SEEMED A CHILD
SHE IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN I REPEATED
SHE IS GROWN UP SHE WILL BE NO
TALLER
MY LITTLE JEWEL SAID M
DE BASSOMPIERRE IN A TONE WHICH PENETRATED
LIKE SOME OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ACCENTS
HE SAT VERY THOUGHTFUL
SIR DON'T GRIEVE I SAID FOR I KNEW HIS FEELINGS UTTERLY UNSPOKEN
AS THEY WERE
SHE IS THE ONLY PEARL I HAVE HE SAID AND NOW OTHERS WILL FIND OUT
THAT SHE IS PURE AND OF PRICE THEY WILL COVET HER
I MADE NO ANSWER
GRAHAM BRETTON HAD DINED WITH US THAT DAY HE HAD
SHONE BOTH IN CONVERSE AND LOOKS I KNOW NOT WHAT PRIDE OF BLOOM
EMBELLISHED HIS ASPECT AND MELLOWED HIS INTERCOURSE
UNDER THE STIMULUS
OF A HIGH HOPE SOMETHING HAD UNFOLDED IN HIS WHOLE MANNER WHICH
COMPELLED ATTENTION
I THINK HE HAD PURPOSED ON THAT DAY TO INDICATE
THE ORIGIN OF HIS ENDEAVOURS AND THE AIM OF HIS AMBITION
M
DE
BASSOMPIERRE HAD FOUND HIMSELF FORCED IN A MANNER TO DESCRY THE
DIRECTION AND CATCH THE CHARACTER OF HIS HOMAGE
SLOW IN REMARKING HE
WAS LOGICAL IN REASONING HAVING ONCE SEIZED THE THREAD IT HAD GUIDED
HIM THROUGH A LONG LABYRINTH
WHERE IS SHE HE ASKED
SHE IS UP STAIRS
WHAT IS SHE DOING
SHE IS WRITING
SHE WRITES DOES SHE DOES SHE RECEIVE LETTERS
NONE BUT SUCH AS SHE CAN SHOW ME
AND SIR SHE THEY HAVE LONG
WANTED TO CONSULT YOU
PSHAW THEY DON'T THINK OF ME AN OLD FATHER I AM IN THE WAY
AH M
DE BASSOMPIERRE NOT SO THAT CAN'T BE BUT PAULINA MUST SPEAK
FOR HERSELF AND DR
BRETTON TOO MUST BE HIS OWN ADVOCATE
IT IS A LITTLE LATE
MATTERS ARE ADVANCED IT SEEMS
SIR TILL YOU APPROVE NOTHING IS DONE ONLY THEY LOVE EACH OTHER
ONLY HE ECHOED
INVESTED BY FATE WITH THE PART OF CONFIDANTE AND MEDIATOR I WAS
OBLIGED TO GO ON HUNDREDS OF TIMES HAS DR
BRETTON BEEN ON THE POINT
OF APPEALING TO YOU SIR BUT WITH ALL HIS HIGH COURAGE HE FEARS YOU
MORTALLY
HE MAY WELL HE MAY WELL FEAR ME
HE HAS TOUCHED THE BEST THING I
HAVE
HAD HE BUT LET HER ALONE SHE WOULD HAVE REMAINED A CHILD FOR
YEARS YET
SO
ARE THEY ENGAGED
THEY COULD NOT BECOME ENGAGED WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION
IT IS WELL FOR YOU MISS SNOWE TO TALK AND THINK WITH THAT PROPRIETY
WHICH ALWAYS CHARACTERIZES YOU BUT THIS MATTER IS A GRIEF TO ME MY
LITTLE GIRL WAS ALL I HAD I HAVE NO MORE DAUGHTERS AND NO SON BRETTON
MIGHT AS WELL HAVE LOOKED ELSEWHERE THERE ARE SCORES OF RICH AND
PRETTY WOMEN WHO WOULD NOT I DARESAY DISLIKE HIM HE HAS LOOKS AND
CONDUCT AND CONNECTION
WOULD NOTHING SERVE HIM BUT MY POLLY
IF HE HAD NEVER SEEN YOUR 'POLLY OTHERS MIGHT AND WOULD HAVE PLEASED
HIM YOUR NIECE MISS FANSHAWE FOR INSTANCE
AH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM GINEVRA WITH ALL MY HEART BUT POLLY I
CAN'T LET HIM HAVE HER
NO I CAN'T
HE IS NOT HER EQUAL HE AFFIRMED
RATHER GRUFFLY
IN WHAT PARTICULAR IS HE HER MATCH THEY TALK OF
FORTUNE I AM NOT AN AVARICIOUS OR INTERESTED MAN BUT THE WORLD THINKS
OF THESE THINGS AND POLLY WILL BE RICH
YES THAT IS KNOWN SAID I ALL VILLETTE KNOWS HER AS AN HEIRESS
DO THEY TALK OF MY LITTLE GIRL IN THAT LIGHT
THEY DO SIR
HE FELL INTO DEEP THOUGHT
I VENTURED TO SAY WOULD YOU SIR THINK
ANY ONE PAULINA'S MATCH WOULD YOU PREFER ANY OTHER TO DR
BRETTON DO
YOU THINK HIGHER RANK OR MORE WEALTH WOULD MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN YOUR
FEELINGS TOWARDS A FUTURE SON IN LAW
YOU TOUCH ME THERE SAID HE
LOOK AT THE ARISTOCRACY OF VILLETTE YOU WOULD NOT LIKE THEM SIR
I SHOULD NOT NEVER A DUC BARON OR VICOMTE OF THE LOT
I AM TOLD MANY OF THESE PERSONS THINK ABOUT HER SIR I WENT ON
GAINING COURAGE ON FINDING THAT I MET ATTENTION RATHER THAN REPULSE
OTHER SUITORS WILL COME THEREFORE IF DR
BRETTON IS REFUSED
WHEREVER YOU GO I SUPPOSE ASPIRANTS WILL NOT BE WANTING
INDEPENDENT
OF HEIRESS SHIP IT APPEARS TO ME THAT PAULINA CHARMS MOST OF THOSE WHO
SEE HER
DOES SHE HOW MY LITTLE GIRL IS NOT THOUGHT A BEAUTY
SIR MISS DE BASSOMPIERRE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL
NONSENSE BEGGING YOUR PARDON MISS SNOWE BUT I THINK YOU ARE TOO
PARTIAL
I LIKE POLLY I LIKE ALL HER WAYS AND ALL HER LOOKS BUT THEN
I AM HER FATHER AND EVEN I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT BEAUTY
SHE IS AMUSING
FAIRY LIKE INTERESTING TO ME YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING HER
HANDSOME
SHE ATTRACTS SIR SHE WOULD ATTRACT WITHOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF YOUR
WEALTH AND POSITION
MY WEALTH AND POSITION ARE THESE ANY BAIT TO GRAHAM IF I THOUGHT
SO
DR
BRETTON KNOWS THESE POINTS PERFECTLY AS YOU MAY BE SURE M
DE
BASSOMPIERRE AND VALUES THEM AS ANY GENTLEMAN WOULD AS YOU WOULD
YOURSELF UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY ARE NOT HIS BAITS
HE
LOVES YOUR DAUGHTER VERY MUCH HE FEELS HER FINEST QUALITIES AND THEY
INFLUENCE HIM WORTHILY
WHAT HAS MY LITTLE PET 'FINE QUALITIES
AH SIR DID YOU OBSERVE HER THAT EVENING WHEN SO MANY MEN OF EMINENCE
AND LEARNING DINED HERE
I CERTAINLY WAS RATHER STRUCK AND SURPRISED WITH HER MANNER THAT DAY
ITS WOMANLINESS MADE ME SMILE
AND DID YOU SEE THOSE ACCOMPLISHED FRENCHMEN GATHER ROUND HER IN THE
DRAWING ROOM
I DID BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS BY WAY OF RELAXATION AS ONE MIGHT AMUSE
ONE'S SELF WITH A PRETTY INFANT
SIR SHE DEMEANED HERSELF WITH DISTINCTION AND I HEARD THE FRENCH
GENTLEMEN SAY SHE WAS 'PTRIE D'ESPRIT ET DE GRACES DR
BRETTON
THOUGHT THE SAME
SHE IS A GOOD DEAR CHILD THAT IS CERTAIN AND I DO BELIEVE SHE HAS
SOME CHARACTER
WHEN I THINK OF IT I WAS ONCE ILL POLLY NURSED ME
THEY THOUGHT I SHOULD DIE SHE I RECOLLECT GREW AT ONCE STRONGER AND
TENDERER AS I GREW WORSE IN HEALTH
AND AS I RECOVERED WHAT A SUNBEAM
SHE WAS IN MY SICK ROOM YES SHE PLAYED ABOUT MY CHAIR AS NOISELESSLY
AND AS CHEERFUL AS LIGHT
AND NOW SHE IS SOUGHT IN MARRIAGE I DON'T
WANT TO PART WITH HER SAID HE AND HE GROANED
YOU HAVE KNOWN DR
AND MRS
BRETTON SO LONG I SUGGESTED IT WOULD
BE LESS LIKE SEPARATION TO GIVE HER TO HIM THAN TO ANOTHER
HE REFLECTED RATHER GLOOMILY
TRUE
I HAVE LONG KNOWN LOUISA BRETTON HE MURMURED
SHE AND I ARE
INDEED OLD OLD FRIENDS A SWEET KIND GIRL SHE WAS WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG
YOU TALK OF BEAUTY MISS SNOWE SHE WAS HANDSOME IF YOU WILL TALL
STRAIGHT AND BLOOMING NOT THE MERE CHILD OR ELF MY POLLY SEEMS TO ME
AT EIGHTEEN LOUISA HAD A CARRIAGE AND STATURE FIT FOR A PRINCESS
SHE
IS A COMELY AND A GOOD WOMAN NOW
THE LAD IS LIKE HER I HAVE ALWAYS
THOUGHT SO AND FAVOURED AND WISHED HIM WELL
NOW HE REPAYS ME BY THIS
ROBBERY MY LITTLE TREASURE USED TO LOVE HER OLD FATHER DEARLY AND
TRULY
IT IS ALL OVER NOW DOUBTLESS I AM AN INCUMBRANCE
THE DOOR OPENED HIS LITTLE TREASURE CAME IN
SHE WAS DRESSED SO TO
SPEAK IN EVENING BEAUTY THAT ANIMATION WHICH SOMETIMES COMES WITH THE
CLOSE OF DAY WARMED HER EYE AND CHEEK A TINGE OF SUMMER CRIMSON
HEIGHTENED HER COMPLEXION HER CURLS FELL FULL AND LONG ON HER LILY
NECK HER WHITE DRESS SUITED THE HEAT OF JUNE
THINKING ME ALONE SHE
HAD BROUGHT IN HER HAND THE LETTER JUST WRITTEN BROUGHT IT FOLDED BUT
UNSEALED
I WAS TO READ IT
WHEN SHE SAW HER FATHER HER TRIPPING STEP
FALTERED A LITTLE PAUSED A MOMENT THE COLOUR IN HER CHEEK FLOWED ROSY
OVER HER WHOLE FACE
POLLY SAID M
DE BASSOMPIERRE IN A LOW VOICE WITH A GRAVE SMILE
DO YOU BLUSH AT SEEING PAPA THAT IS SOMETHING NEW
I DON'T BLUSH I NEVER DO BLUSH AFFIRMED SHE WHILE ANOTHER EDDY
FROM THE HEART SENT UP ITS SCARLET
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN THE
DINING ROOM AND I WANTED LUCY
YOU THOUGHT I WAS WITH JOHN GRAHAM BRETTON I SUPPOSE BUT HE HAS JUST
BEEN CALLED OUT HE WILL BE BACK SOON POLLY

AMAZE

COUNTRYMEN ARE THE VICTIMS OF PREJUDICE

SHE STOOD LOOKING AT HIM A MINUTE
SHE WANTED TO SHOW FIRMNESS
SUPERIORITY TO TAUNTS KNOWING HER FATHER'S CHARACTER GUESSING HIS FEW
FOIBLES SHE HAD EXPECTED THE SORT OF SCENE WHICH WAS NOW TRANSPIRING
IT DID NOT TAKE HER BY SURPRISE AND SHE DESIRED TO LET IT PASS WITH
DIGNITY RELIANT UPON REACTION

SUDDENLY HER SOUL MELTED IN HER EYES SHE FELL ON HIS NECK I WON'T
LEAVE YOU PAPA I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU
I WON'T PAIN YOU I'LL NEVER
PAIN YOU WAS HER CRY
MY LAMB MY TREASURE MURMURED THE LOVING THOUGH RUGGED SIRE
HE SAID
NO MORE FOR THE MOMENT INDEED THOSE TWO WORDS WERE HOARSE
THE ROOM WAS NOW DARKENING

THINKING IT MIGHT BE A SERVANT COMING WITH CANDLES I GENTLY OPENED TO
PREVENT INTRUSION
IN THE ANTE ROOM STOOD NO SERVANT A TALL GENTLEMAN
WAS PLACING HIS HAT ON THE TABLE DRAWING OFF HIS GLOVES
SLOWLY LINGERING WAITING IT SEEMED TO ME
HE CALLED ME NEITHER BY
SIGN NOR WORD YET HIS EYE SAID LUCY COME HERE AND I WENT
OVER HIS FACE A SMILE FLOWED WHILE HE LOOKED DOWN ON ME NO TEMPER

SHE
GAZED TENDERLY ON HER FURROWED SIRE
PAPA I LOVE YOU BOTH SAID SHE I CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU BOTH
I NEED
NOT SEND GRAHAM AWAY HE CAN LIVE HERE HE WILL BE NO INCONVENIENCE
SHE ALLEGED WITH THAT SIMPLICITY OF PHRASEOLOGY WHICH AT TIMES WAS WONT

HE WILL BE A PRODIGIOUS INCONVENIENCE TO ME STILL PERSISTED MR
HOME
I DON'T WANT HIM POLLY HE IS TOO TALL HE IS IN MY WAY

HE SEEMED EXCEEDINGLY TALL TO ME AT
FIRST LIKE A TOWER WHEN I LOOKED UP AT HIM BUT ON THE WHOLE I WOULD
RATHER NOT HAVE HIM OTHERWISE
I OBJECT TO HIM ALTOGETHER POLLY I CAN DO WITHOUT A SON IN LAW
I
SHOULD NEVER HAVE REQUESTED THE BEST MAN IN THE LAND TO STAND TO ME IN
THAT RELATION
DISMISS THIS GENTLEMAN
BUT HE HAS KNOWN YOU SO LONG PAPA AND SUITS YOU SO WELL
SUITS ME FORSOOTH YES HE HAS PRETENDED TO MAKE MY OPINIONS AND
TASTES HIS OWN

SHAKE HANDS WITH GRAHAM PAPA

BETWEEN YOU
INDEED INDEED YOU ARE FRIENDS
GRAHAM STRETCH OUT YOUR RIGHT
HAND
PAPA PUT OUT YOURS
NOW LET THEM TOUCH
PAPA DON'T BE STIFF
CLOSE YOUR FINGERS BE PLIANT THERE BUT THAT IS NOT A CLASP IT IS A
GRASP PAPA YOU GRASP LIKE A VICE
YOU CRUSH GRAHAM'S HAND TO THE
BONE YOU HURT HIM
HE MUST HAVE HURT HIM FOR HE WORE A MASSIVE RING SET ROUND WITH
BRILLIANTS OF WHICH THE SHARP FACETS CUT INTO GRAHAM'S FLESH AND DREW
BLOOD BUT PAIN ONLY MADE DR
JOHN LAUGH AS ANXIETY HAD MADE HIM SMILE
COME WITH ME INTO MY STUDY AT LAST SAID MR
HOME TO THE DOCTOR
THEY
WENT
THEIR INTERCOURSE WAS NOT LONG BUT I SUPPOSE IT WAS CONCLUSIVE
THE SUITOR HAD TO UNDERGO AN INTERROGATORY AND A SCRUTINY ON MANY
THINGS
WHETHER DR
BRETTON WAS AT TIMES GUILEFUL IN LOOK AND LANGUAGE
OR NOT THERE WAS A SOUND FOUNDATION BELOW
HIS ANSWERS I UNDERSTOOD
AFTERWARDS EVINCED BOTH WISDOM AND INTEGRITY
HE HAD MANAGED HIS
AFFAIRS WELL
HE HAD STRUGGLED THROUGH ENTANGLEMENTS HIS FORTUNES WERE
IN THE WAY OF RETRIEVAL HE PROVED HIMSELF IN A POSITION TO MARRY
ONCE MORE THE FATHER AND LOVER APPEARED IN THE LIBRARY
M
DE
BASSOMPIERRE SHUT THE DOOR HE POINTED TO HIS DAUGHTER
TAKE HER HE SAID
TAKE HER JOHN BRETTON AND MAY GOD DEAL WITH YOU
AS YOU DEAL WITH HER
NOT LONG AFTER PERHAPS A FORTNIGHT I SAW THREE PERSONS COUNT DE
BASSOMPIERRE HIS DAUGHTER AND DR
GRAHAM BRETTON SITTING ON ONE
SEAT UNDER A LOW SPREADING AND UMBRAGEOUS TREE IN THE GROUNDS OF THE
PALACE AT BOIS L'ETANG
THEY HAD COME THITHER TO ENJOY A SUMMER
EVENING OUTSIDE THE MAGNIFICENT GATES THEIR CARRIAGE WAITED TO TAKE
THEM HOME THE GREEN SWEEPS OF TURF SPREAD ROUND THEM QUIET AND DIM
THE PALACE ROSE AT A DISTANCE WHITE AS A CRAG ON PENTELICUS THE
EVENING STAR SHONE ABOVE IT A FOREST OF FLOWERING SHRUBS EMBALMED THE
CLIMATE OF THIS SPOT THE HOUR WAS STILL AND SWEET THE SCENE BUT FOR
THIS GROUP WAS SOLITARY
PAULINA SAT BETWEEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN WHILE THEY CONVERSED HER LITTLE
HANDS WERE BUSY AT SOME WORK I THOUGHT AT FIRST SHE WAS BINDING A
NOSEGAY
NO WITH THE TINY PAIR OF SCISSORS GLITTERING IN HER LAP SHE
HAD SEVERED SPOILS FROM EACH MANLY HEAD BESIDE HER AND WAS NOW
OCCUPIED IN PLAITING TOGETHER THE GREY LOCK AND THE GOLDEN WAVE
THE
PLAIT WOVEN NO SILK THREAD BEING AT HAND TO BIND IT A TRESS OF HER
OWN HAIR WAS MADE TO SERVE THAT PURPOSE SHE TIED IT LIKE A KNOT
PRISONED IT IN A LOCKET AND LAID IT ON HER HEART
NOW SAID SHE THERE IS AN AMULET MADE WHICH HAS VIRTUE TO KEEP YOU
TWO ALWAYS FRIENDS
YOU CAN NEVER QUARREL SO LONG AS I WEAR THIS
AN AMULET WAS INDEED MADE A SPELL FRAMED WHICH RENDERED ENMITY
IMPOSSIBLE
SHE WAS BECOME A BOND TO BOTH AN INFLUENCE OVER EACH A
MUTUAL CONCORD
FROM THEM SHE DREW HER HAPPINESS AND WHAT SHE
BORROWED SHE WITH INTEREST GAVE BACK
IS THERE INDEED SUCH HAPPINESS ON EARTH I ASKED AS I WATCHED THE
FATHER THE DAUGHTER THE FUTURE HUSBAND NOW UNITED ALL BLESSED AND
BLESSING
YES IT IS SO
WITHOUT ANY COLOURING OF ROMANCE OR ANY EXAGGERATION OF
FANCY IT IS SO
SOME REAL LIVES DO FOR SOME CERTAIN DAYS OR
YEARS ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE THE HAPPINESS OF HEAVEN AND I BELIEVE IF
SUCH PERFECT HAPPINESS IS ONCE FELT BY GOOD PEOPLE TO THE WICKED IT
NEVER COMES ITS SWEET EFFECT IS NEVER WHOLLY LOST
WHATEVER TRIALS
FOLLOW WHATEVER PAINS OF SICKNESS OR SHADES OF DEATH THE GLORY
PRECEDENT STILL SHINES THROUGH CHEERING THE KEEN ANGUISH AND TINGING
THE DEEP CLOUD
I WILL GO FARTHER
I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME HUMAN BEINGS SO BORN
SO REARED SO GUIDED FROM A SOFT CRADLE TO A CALM AND LATE GRAVE THAT
NO EXCESSIVE SUFFERING PENETRATES THEIR LOT AND NO TEMPESTUOUS
BLACKNESS OVERCASTS THEIR JOURNEY
AND OFTEN THESE ARE NOT PAMPERED
SELFISH BEINGS BUT NATURE'S ELECT HARMONIOUS AND BENIGN MEN AND
WOMEN MILD WITH CHARITY KIND AGENTS OF GOD'S KIND ATTRIBUTES
LET ME NOT DELAY THE HAPPY TRUTH
GRAHAM BRETTON AND PAULINA DE
BASSOMPIERRE WERE MARRIED AND SUCH AN AGENT DID DR
BRETTON PROVE
HE
DID NOT WITH TIME DEGENERATE HIS FAULTS DECAYED HIS VIRTUES RIPENED
HE ROSE IN INTELLECTUAL REFINEMENT HE WON IN MORAL PROFIT ALL DREGS
FILTERED AWAY THE CLEAR WINE SETTLED BRIGHT AND TRANQUIL
BRIGHT TOO
WAS THE DESTINY OF HIS SWEET WIFE
SHE KEPT HER HUSBAND'S LOVE SHE
AIDED IN HIS PROGRESS OF HIS HAPPINESS SHE WAS THE CORNER STONE
THIS PAIR WAS BLESSED INDEED FOR YEARS BROUGHT THEM WITH GREAT
PROSPERITY GREAT GOODNESS THEY IMPARTED WITH OPEN HAND YET WISELY
DOUBTLESS THEY KNEW CROSSES DISAPPOINTMENTS DIFFICULTIES BUT THESE
WERE WELL BORNE
MORE THAN ONCE TOO THEY HAD TO LOOK ON HIM WHOSE
FACE FLESH SCARCE CAN SEE AND LIVE THEY HAD TO PAY THEIR TRIBUTE TO
THE KING OF TERRORS
IN THE FULNESS OF YEARS M
DE BASSOMPIERRE WAS
TAKEN IN RIPE OLD AGE DEPARTED LOUISA BRETTON
ONCE EVEN THERE ROSE A
CRY IN THEIR HALLS OF RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN BUT OTHERS
SPRANG HEALTHY AND BLOOMING TO REPLACE THE LOST DR
BRETTON SAW
HIMSELF LIVE AGAIN IN A SON WHO INHERITED HIS LOOKS AND HIS
DISPOSITION HE HAD STATELY DAUGHTERS TOO LIKE HIMSELF THESE
CHILDREN HE REARED WITH A SUAVE YET A FIRM HAND THEY GREW UP
ACCORDING TO INHERITANCE AND NURTURE
IN SHORT I DO BUT SPEAK THE TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT THESE TWO LIVES OF
GRAHAM AND PAULINA WERE BLESSED LIKE THAT OF JACOB'S FAVOURED SON
WITH BLESSINGS OF HEAVEN ABOVE BLESSINGS OF THE DEEP THAT LIES
UNDER IT WAS SO FOR GOD SAW THAT IT WAS GOOD
CHAPTER XXXVIII
CLOUD
BUT IT IS NOT SO FOR ALL
WHAT THEN HIS WILL BE DONE AS DONE IT
SURELY WILL BE WHETHER WE HUMBLE OURSELVES TO RESIGNATION OR NOT
THE
IMPULSE OF CREATION FORWARDS IT THE STRENGTH OF POWERS SEEN AND
UNSEEN HAS ITS FULFILMENT IN CHARGE
PROOF OF A LIFE TO COME MUST BE
GIVEN
IN FIRE AND IN BLOOD IF NEEDFUL MUST THAT PROOF BE WRITTEN
IN
FIRE AND IN BLOOD DO WE TRACE THE RECORD THROUGHOUT NATURE
IN FIRE AND
IN BLOOD DOES IT CROSS OUR OWN EXPERIENCE
SUFFERER FAINT NOT THROUGH
TERROR OF THIS BURNING EVIDENCE
TIRED WAYFARER GIRD UP THY LOINS
LOOK UPWARD MARCH ONWARD
PILGRIMS AND BROTHER MOURNERS JOIN IN
FRIENDLY COMPANY
DARK THROUGH THE WILDERNESS OF THIS WORLD STRETCHES
THE WAY FOR MOST OF US EQUAL AND STEADY BE OUR TREAD BE OUR CROSS OUR
BANNER
FOR STAFF WE HAVE HIS PROMISE WHOSE WORD IS TRIED WHOSE WAY
PERFECT FOR PRESENT HOPE HIS PROVIDENCE WHO GIVES THE SHIELD OF
SALVATION WHOSE GENTLENESS MAKES GREAT FOR FINAL HOME HIS BOSOM WHO
DWELLS IN THE HEIGHT OF HEAVEN FOR CROWNING PRIZE A GLORY EXCEEDING
AND ETERNAL
LET US SO RUN THAT WE MAY OBTAIN LET US ENDURE HARDNESS
AS GOOD SOLDIERS LET US FINISH OUR COURSE AND KEEP THE FAITH RELIANT
IN THE ISSUE TO COME OFF MORE THAN CONQUERORS ART THOU NOT FROM
EVERLASTING MINE HOLY ONE WE SHALL NOT DIE
ON A THURSDAY MORNING WE WERE ALL ASSEMBLED IN CLASSE WAITING FOR THE
LESSON OF LITERATURE
THE HOUR WAS COME WE EXPECTED THE MASTER
THE PUPILS OF THE FIRST CLASSE SAT VERY STILL THE CLEANLY WRITTEN
COMPOSITIONS PREPARED SINCE THE LAST LESSON LAY READY BEFORE THEM
NEATLY TIED WITH RIBBON WAITING TO BE GATHERED BY THE HAND OF THE
PROFESSOR AS HE MADE HIS RAPID ROUND OF THE DESKS
THE MONTH WAS JULY
THE MORNING FINE THE GLASS DOOR STOOD AJAR THROUGH IT PLAYED A FRESH
BREEZE AND PLANTS GROWING AT THE LINTEL WAVED BENT LOOKED IN
SEEMING TO WHISPER TIDINGS
M
EMANUEL WAS NOT ALWAYS QUITE PUNCTUAL WE SCARCELY WONDERED AT HIS
BEING A LITTLE LATE BUT WE WONDERED WHEN THE DOOR AT LAST OPENED AND
INSTEAD OF HIM WITH HIS SWIFTNESS AND HIS FIRE THERE CAME QUIETLY UPON
US THE CAUTIOUS MADAME BECK
SHE APPROACHED M
PAUL'S DESK SHE STOOD BEFORE IT SHE DREW ROUND HER
THE LIGHT SHAWL COVERING HER SHOULDERS BEGINNING TO SPEAK IN LOW YET
FIRM TONES AND WITH A FIXED GAZE SHE SAID THIS MORNING THERE WILL
BE NO LESSON OF LITERATURE
THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF HER ADDRESS FOLLOWED AFTER ABOUT TWO MINUTES'
PAUSE
IT IS PROBABLE THE LESSONS WILL BE SUSPENDED FOR A WEEK
I SHALL
REQUIRE AT LEAST THAT SPACE OF TIME TO FIND AN EFFICIENT SUBSTITUTE FOR
M
EMANUEL
MEANWHILE IT SHALL BE OUR STUDY TO FILL THE BLANKS
USEFULLY
YOUR PROFESSOR LADIES SHE WENT ON INTENDS IF POSSIBLE DULY TO
TAKE LEAVE OF YOU
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT HE HAS NOT LEISURE FOR THAT
CEREMONY
HE IS PREPARING FOR A LONG VOYAGE
A VERY SUDDEN AND URGENT
SUMMONS OF DUTY CALLS HIM TO A GREAT DISTANCE
HE HAS DECIDED TO LEAVE
EUROPE FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME
PERHAPS HE MAY TELL YOU MORE HIMSELF
LADIES INSTEAD OF THE USUAL LESSON WITH M
EMANUEL YOU WILL THIS
MORNING READ ENGLISH WITH MADEMOISELLE LUCY
SHE BENT HER HEAD COURTEOUSLY DREW CLOSER THE FOLDS OF HER SHAWL AND
PASSED FROM THE CLASSE
A GREAT SILENCE FELL THEN A MURMUR WENT ROUND THE ROOM I BELIEVE SOME
PUPILS WEPT
SOME TIME ELAPSED
THE NOISE THE WHISPERING THE OCCASIONAL SOBBING
INCREASED
I BECAME CONSCIOUS OF A RELAXATION OF DISCIPLINE A SORT OF
GROWING DISORDER AS IF MY GIRLS FELT THAT VIGILANCE WAS WITHDRAWN AND
THAT SURVEILLANCE HAD VIRTUALLY LEFT THE CLASSE
HABIT AND THE SENSE OF
DUTY ENABLED ME TO RALLY QUICKLY TO RISE IN MY USUAL WAY TO SPEAK IN
MY USUAL TONE TO ENJOIN AND FINALLY TO ESTABLISH QUIET
I MADE THE
ENGLISH READING LONG AND CLOSE
I KEPT THEM AT IT THE WHOLE MORNING
I
REMEMBER FEELING A SENTIMENT OF IMPATIENCE TOWARDS THE PUPILS WHO
SOBBED
INDEED THEIR EMOTION WAS NOT OF MUCH VALUE IT WAS ONLY AN
HYSTERIC AGITATION
I TOLD THEM SO UNSPARINGLY
I HALF RIDICULED THEM
I WAS SEVERE
THE TRUTH WAS I COULD NOT DO WITH THEIR TEARS OR THAT
GASPING SOUND I COULD NOT BEAR IT
A RATHER WEAK MINDED LOW SPIRITED
PUPIL KEPT IT UP WHEN THE OTHERS HAD DONE RELENTLESS NECESSITY OBLIGED
AND ASSISTED ME SO TO ACCOST HER THAT SHE DARED NOT CARRY ON THE
DEMONSTRATION THAT SHE WAS FORCED TO CONQUER THE CONVULSION
THAT GIRL WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO HATE ME EXCEPT THAT WHEN SCHOOL
WAS OVER AND HER COMPANIONS DEPARTING I ORDERED HER TO STAY AND WHEN
THEY WERE GONE I DID WHAT I HAD NEVER DONE TO ONE AMONG THEM
BEFORE PRESSED HER TO MY HEART AND KISSED HER CHEEK
BUT THIS IMPULSE
YIELDED TO I SPEEDILY PUT HER OUT OF THE CLASSE FOR UPON THAT
POIGNANT STRAIN SHE WEPT MORE BITTERLY THAN EVER
I FILLED WITH OCCUPATION EVERY MINUTE OF THAT DAY AND SHOULD HAVE
LIKED TO SIT UP ALL NIGHT IF I MIGHT HAVE KEPT A CANDLE BURNING THE
NIGHT HOWEVER PROVED A BAD TIME AND LEFT BAD EFFECTS PREPARING ME
ILL FOR THE NEXT DAY'S ORDEAL OF INSUFFERABLE GOSSIP
OF COURSE THIS
NEWS FELL UNDER GENERAL DISCUSSION
SOME LITTLE RESERVE HAD ACCOMPANIED
THE FIRST SURPRISE THAT SOON WORE OFF EVERY MOUTH OPENED EVERY
TONGUE WAGGED TEACHERS PUPILS THE VERY SERVANTS MOUTHED THE NAME OF
EMANUEL HE WHOSE CONNECTION WITH THE SCHOOL WAS CONTEMPORARY WITH
ITS COMMENCEMENT THUS SUDDENLY TO WITHDRAW ALL FELT IT STRANGE
THEY TALKED SO MUCH SO LONG SO OFTEN THAT OUT OF THE VERY MULTITUDE
OF THEIR WORDS AND RUMOURS GREW AT LAST SOME INTELLIGENCE
ABOUT THE
THIRD DAY I HEARD IT SAID THAT HE WAS TO SAIL IN A WEEK THEN THAT HE
WAS BOUND FOR THE WEST INDIES
I LOOKED AT MADAME BECK'S FACE AND INTO
HER EYES FOR DISPROOF OR CONFIRMATION OF THIS REPORT I PERUSED HER
ALL OVER FOR INFORMATION BUT NO PART OF HER DISCLOSED MORE THAN WHAT
WAS UNPERTURBED AND COMMONPLACE
THIS SECESSION WAS AN IMMENSE LOSS TO HER SHE ALLEGED
SHE DID NOT
KNOW HOW SHE SHOULD FILL UP THE VACANCY
SHE WAS SO USED TO HER
KINSMAN HE HAD BECOME HER RIGHT HAND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO WITHOUT HIM
SHE HAD OPPOSED THE STEP BUT M
PAUL HAD CONVINCED HER IT WAS HIS
DUTY
SHE SAID ALL THIS IN PUBLIC IN CLASSE AT THE DINNER TABLE SPEAKING
AUDIBLY TO ZLIE ST
PIERRE
WHY WAS IT HIS DUTY I COULD HAVE ASKED HER THAT
I HAD IMPULSES TO
TAKE HOLD OF HER SUDDENLY AS SHE CALMLY PASSED ME IN CLASSE TO
STRETCH OUT MY HAND AND GRASP HER FAST AND SAY STOP
LET US HEAR THE
CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER
WHY IS IT HIS DUTY TO GO INTO
BANISHMENT BUT MADAME ALWAYS ADDRESSED SOME OTHER TEACHER AND NEVER
LOOKED AT ME NEVER SEEMED CONSCIOUS I COULD HAVE A CARE IN THE
QUESTION
THE WEEK WORE ON
NOTHING MORE WAS SAID ABOUT M
EMANUEL COMING TO BID
US GOOD BY AND NONE SEEMED ANXIOUS FOR HIS COMING NONE QUESTIONED
WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD COME NONE BETRAYED TORMENT LEST HE SHOULD
DEPART SILENT AND UNSEEN INCESSANTLY DID THEY TALK AND NEVER IN ALL
THEIR TALK TOUCHED ON THIS VITAL POINT
AS TO MADAME SHE OF COURSE
COULD SEE HIM AND SAY TO HIM AS MUCH AS SHE PLEASED
WHAT SHOULD SHE
CARE WHETHER OR NOT HE APPEARED IN THE SCHOOLROOM
THE WEEK CONSUMED
WE WERE TOLD THAT HE WAS GOING ON SUCH A DAY THAT
HIS DESTINATION WAS BASSETERRE IN GUADALOUPE THE BUSINESS WHICH
CALLED HIM ABROAD RELATED TO A FRIEND'S INTERESTS NOT HIS OWN I
THOUGHT AS MUCH
BASSETERRE IN GUADALOUPE I HAD LITTLE SLEEP ABOUT THIS TIME BUT
WHENEVER I DID SLUMBER IT FOLLOWED INFALLIBLY THAT I WAS QUICKLY
ROUSED WITH A START WHILE THE WORDS BASSETERRE GUADALOUPE SEEMED
PRONOUNCED OVER MY PILLOW OR RAN ATHWART THE DARKNESS ROUND AND BEFORE
ME IN ZIGZAG CHARACTERS OF RED OR VIOLET LIGHT
FOR WHAT I FELT THERE WAS NO HELP AND HOW COULD I HELP FEELING M
EMANUEL HAD BEEN VERY KIND TO ME OF LATE DAYS HE HAD BEEN GROWING
HOURLY BETTER AND KINDER
IT WAS NOW A MONTH SINCE WE HAD SETTLED THE
THEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE AND IN ALL THAT TIME THERE HAD BEEN NO QUARREL
NOR HAD OUR PEACE BEEN THE COLD DAUGHTER OF DIVORCE WE HAD NOT LIVED
ALOOF HE HAD COME OFTENER HE HAD TALKED WITH ME MORE THAN BEFORE HE
HAD SPENT HOURS WITH ME WITH TEMPER SOOTHED WITH EYE CONTENT WITH
MANNER HOME LIKE AND MILD
KIND SUBJECTS OF CONVERSATION HAD GROWN
BETWEEN US HE HAD INQUIRED INTO MY PLANS OF LIFE AND I HAD
COMMUNICATED THEM THE SCHOOL PROJECT PLEASED HIM HE MADE ME REPEAT IT
MORE THAN ONCE THOUGH HE CALLED IT AN ALNASCHAR DREAM
THE JAR WAS
OVER THE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING WAS SETTLING AND FIXING FEELINGS OF
UNION AND HOPE MADE THEMSELVES PROFOUNDLY FELT IN THE HEART AFFECTION
AND DEEP ESTEEM AND DAWNING TRUST HAD EACH FASTENED ITS BOND
WHAT QUIET LESSONS I HAD ABOUT THIS TIME NO MORE TAUNTS ON MY
INTELLECT NO MORE MENACES OF GRATING PUBLIC SHOWS HOW SWEETLY FOR
THE JEALOUS GIBE AND THE MORE JEALOUS HALF PASSIONATE EULOGY WERE
SUBSTITUTED A MUTE INDULGENT HELP A FOND GUIDANCE AND A TENDER
FORBEARANCE WHICH FORGAVE BUT NEVER PRAISED
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE
WOULD SIT FOR MANY MINUTES AND NOT SPEAK AT ALL AND WHEN DUSK OR DUTY
BROUGHT SEPARATION HE WOULD LEAVE WITH WORDS LIKE THESE IL EST DOUX
LE REPOS IL EST PRCIEUX LE CALME BONHEUR
ONE EVENING NOT TEN SHORT DAYS SINCE HE JOINED ME WHILST WALKING IN
MY ALLEY
HE TOOK MY HAND
I LOOKED UP IN HIS FACE
I THOUGHT HE MEANT
TO ARREST MY ATTENTION
BONNE PETITE AMIE SAID HE SOFTLY DOUCE CONSOLATRICE BUT THROUGH
HIS TOUCH AND WITH HIS WORDS A NEW FEELING AND A STRANGE THOUGHT
FOUND A COURSE
COULD IT BE THAT HE WAS BECOMING MORE THAN FRIEND OR
BROTHER DID HIS LOOK SPEAK A KINDNESS BEYOND FRATERNITY OR AMITY
HIS ELOQUENT LOOK HAD MORE TO SAY HIS HAND DREW ME FORWARD HIS
INTERPRETING LIPS STIRRED
NO
NOT NOW
HERE INTO THE TWILIGHT ALLEY
BROKE AN INTERRUPTION IT CAME DUAL AND OMINOUS WE FACED TWO BODEFUL
FORMS A WOMAN'S AND A PRIEST'S MADAME BECK AND PRE SILAS
THE ASPECT OF THE LATTER I SHALL NEVER FORGET
ON THE FIRST IMPULSE IT
EXPRESSED A JEAN JACQUES SENSIBILITY STIRRED BY THE SIGNS OF AFFECTION
JUST SURPRISED THEN IMMEDIATELY DARKENED OVER IT THE JAUNDICE OF
ECCLESIASTICAL JEALOUSY
HE SPOKE TO ME WITH UNCTION
HE LOOKED ON
HIS PUPIL WITH STERNNESS
AS TO MADAME BECK SHE OF COURSE SAW
NOTHING NOTHING THOUGH HER KINSMAN RETAINED IN HER PRESENCE THE HAND
OF THE HERETIC FOREIGNER NOT SUFFERING WITHDRAWAL BUT CLASPING IT
CLOSE AND FAST
FOLLOWING THESE INCIDENTS THAT SUDDEN ANNOUNCEMENT OF DEPARTURE HAD
STRUCK ME AT FIRST AS INCREDIBLE
INDEED IT WAS ONLY FREQUENT
REPETITION AND THE CREDENCE OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MINDS ROUND ME
WHICH FORCED ON ME ITS FULL ACCEPTANCE
AS TO THAT WEEK OF SUSPENSE
WITH ITS BLANK YET BURNING DAYS WHICH BROUGHT FROM HIM NO WORD OF
EXPLANATION I REMEMBER BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE ITS PASSAGE
THE LAST DAY BROKE
NOW WOULD HE VISIT US
NOW HE WOULD COME AND SPEAK
HIS FAREWELL OR HE WOULD VANISH MUTE AND BE SEEN BY US NEVERMORE
THIS ALTERNATIVE SEEMED TO BE PRESENT IN THE MIND OF NOT A LIVING
CREATURE IN THAT SCHOOL
ALL ROSE AT THE USUAL HOUR ALL BREAKFASTED AS
USUAL ALL WITHOUT REFERENCE TO OR APPARENT THOUGHT OF THEIR LATE
PROFESSOR BETOOK THEMSELVES WITH WONTED PHLEGM TO THEIR ORDINARY
DUTIES
SO OBLIVIOUS WAS THE HOUSE SO TAME SO TRAINED ITS PROCEEDINGS SO
INEXPECTANT ITS ASPECT I SCARCE KNEW HOW TO BREATHE IN AN ATMOSPHERE
THUS STAGNANT THUS SMOTHERING
WOULD NO ONE LEND ME A VOICE HAD NO
ONE A WISH NO ONE A WORD NO ONE A PRAYER TO WHICH I COULD SAY AMEN
I HAD SEEN THEM UNANIMOUS IN DEMAND FOR THE MEREST TRIFLE A TREAT A
HOLIDAY A LESSON'S REMISSION THEY COULD NOT THEY WOULD NOT NOW
BAND TO BESIEGE MADAME BECK AND INSIST ON A LAST INTERVIEW WITH A
MASTER WHO HAD CERTAINLY BEEN LOVED AT LEAST BY SOME LOVED AS THEY
COULD LOVE BUT OH WHAT IS THE LOVE OF THE MULTITUDE
I KNEW WHERE HE LIVED I KNEW WHERE HE WAS TO BE HEARD OF OR
COMMUNICATED WITH THE DISTANCE WAS SCARCE A STONE'S THROW HAD IT BEEN
IN THE NEXT ROOM UNSUMMONED I COULD MAKE NO USE OF MY KNOWLEDGE
TO
FOLLOW TO SEEK OUT TO REMIND TO RECALL FOR THESE THINGS I HAD NO
FACULTY
M
EMANUEL MIGHT HAVE PASSED WITHIN REACH OF MY ARM HAD HE PASSED
SILENT AND UNNOTICING SILENT AND STIRLESS SHOULD I HAVE SUFFERED HIM
TO GO BY
MORNING WASTED
AFTERNOON CAME AND I THOUGHT ALL WAS OVER
MY HEART
TREMBLED IN ITS PLACE
MY BLOOD WAS TROUBLED IN ITS CURRENT
I WAS
QUITE SICK AND HARDLY KNEW HOW TO KEEP AT MY POST OR DO MY WORK
YET
THE LITTLE WORLD ROUND ME PLODDED ON INDIFFERENT ALL SEEMED JOCUND
FREE OF CARE OR FEAR OR THOUGHT THE VERY PUPILS WHO SEVEN DAYS
SINCE HAD WEPT HYSTERICALLY AT A STARTLING PIECE OF NEWS APPEARED
QUITE TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THE NEWS ITS IMPORT AND THEIR EMOTION
A LITTLE BEFORE FIVE O'CLOCK THE HOUR OF DISMISSAL MADAME BECK SENT
FOR ME TO HER CHAMBER TO READ OVER AND TRANSLATE SOME ENGLISH LETTER
SHE HAD RECEIVED AND TO WRITE FOR HER THE ANSWER
BEFORE SETTLING TO
THIS WORK I OBSERVED THAT SHE SOFTLY CLOSED THE TWO DOORS OF HER
CHAMBER SHE EVEN SHUT AND FASTENED THE CASEMENT THOUGH IT WAS A HOT
DAY AND FREE CIRCULATION OF AIR WAS USUALLY REGARDED BY HER AS
INDISPENSABLE
WHY THIS PRECAUTION A KEEN SUSPICION AN ALMOST FIERCE
DISTRUST SUGGESTED SUCH QUESTION
DID SHE WANT TO EXCLUDE SOUND WHAT
SOUND
I LISTENED AS I HAD NEVER LISTENED BEFORE I LISTENED LIKE THE EVENING
AND WINTER WOLF SNUFFING THE SNOW SCENTING PREY AND HEARING FAR OFF
THE TRAVELLER'S TRAMP
YET I COULD BOTH LISTEN AND WRITE
ABOUT THE
MIDDLE OF THE LETTER I HEARD WHAT CHECKED MY PEN A TREAD IN THE
VESTIBULE
NO DOOR BELL HAD RUNG ROSINE ACTING DOUBTLESS BY
ORDERS HAD ANTICIPATED SUCH RVEILLE
MADAME SAW ME HALT
SHE
COUGHED MADE A BUSTLE SPOKE LOUDER
THE TREAD HAD PASSED ON TO THE
CLASSES
PROCEED SAID MADAME BUT MY HAND WAS FETTERED MY EAR ENCHAINED MY
THOUGHTS WERE CARRIED OFF CAPTIVE
THE CLASSES FORMED ANOTHER BUILDING THE HALL PARTED THEM FROM THE
DWELLING HOUSE DESPITE DISTANCE AND PARTITION I HEARD THE SUDDEN STIR
OF NUMBERS A WHOLE DIVISION RISING AT ONCE
THEY ARE PUTTING AWAY WORK SAID MADAME
IT WAS INDEED THE HOUR TO PUT AWAY WORK BUT WHY THAT SUDDEN HUSH THAT
INSTANT QUELL OF THE TUMULT
WAIT MADAME I WILL SEE WHAT IT IS
AND I PUT DOWN MY PEN AND LEFT HER
LEFT HER NO SHE WOULD NOT BE
LEFT POWERLESS TO DETAIN ME SHE ROSE AND FOLLOWED CLOSE AS MY
SHADOW
I TURNED ON THE LAST STEP OF THE STAIR
ARE YOU COMING TOO I ASKED
YES SAID SHE MEETING MY GLANCE WITH A PECULIAR ASPECT A LOOK
CLOUDED YET RESOLUTE
WE PROCEEDED THEN NOT TOGETHER BUT SHE WALKED IN MY STEPS
HE WAS COME
ENTERING THE FIRST CLASSE I SAW HIM
THERE ONCE MORE
APPEARED THE FORM MOST FAMILIAR
I DOUBT NOT THEY HAD TRIED TO KEEP HIM
AWAY BUT HE WAS COME
THE GIRLS STOOD IN A SEMICIRCLE HE WAS PASSING ROUND GIVING HIS
FAREWELLS PRESSING EACH HAND TOUCHING WITH HIS LIPS EACH CHEEK
THIS
LAST CEREMONY FOREIGN CUSTOM PERMITTED AT SUCH A PARTING SO SOLEMN
TO LAST SO LONG
I FELT IT HARD THAT MADAME BECK SHOULD DOG ME THUS FOLLOWING AND
WATCHING ME CLOSE MY NECK AND SHOULDER SHRUNK IN FEVER UNDER HER
BREATH I BECAME TERRIBLY GOADED
HE WAS APPROACHING THE SEMICIRCLE WAS ALMOST TRAVELLED ROUND HE CAME
TO THE LAST PUPIL HE TURNED
BUT MADAME WAS BEFORE ME SHE HAD STEPPED
OUT SUDDENLY SHE SEEMED TO MAGNIFY HER PROPORTIONS AND AMPLIFY HER
DRAPERY SHE ECLIPSED ME I WAS HID
SHE KNEW MY WEAKNESS AND
DEFICIENCY SHE COULD CALCULATE THE DEGREE OF MORAL PARALYSIS THE
TOTAL DEFAULT OF SELF ASSERTION WITH WHICH IN A CRISIS I COULD BE
STRUCK
SHE HASTENED TO HER KINSMAN SHE BROKE UPON HIM VOLUBLY SHE
MASTERED HIS ATTENTION SHE HURRIED HIM TO THE DOOR THE GLASS DOOR
OPENING ON THE GARDEN
I THINK HE LOOKED ROUND COULD I BUT HAVE CAUGHT
HIS EYE COURAGE I THINK WOULD HAVE RUSHED IN TO AID FEELING AND
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CHARGE AND PERHAPS A RESCUE BUT ALREADY THE
ROOM WAS ALL CONFUSION THE SEMICIRCLE BROKEN INTO GROUPS MY FIGURE
WAS LOST AMONG THIRTY MORE CONSPICUOUS
MADAME HAD HER WILL YES SHE
GOT HIM AWAY AND HE HAD NOT SEEN ME HE THOUGHT ME ABSENT
FIVE
O'CLOCK STRUCK THE LOUD DISMISSAL BELL RANG THE SCHOOL SEPARATED THE
ROOM EMPTIED
THERE SEEMS TO MY MEMORY AN ENTIRE DARKNESS AND DISTRACTION IN SOME
CERTAIN MINUTES I THEN PASSED ALONE A GRIEF INEXPRESSIBLE OVER A LOSS
UNENDURABLE
WHAT SHOULD I DO OH WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN ALL MY
LIFE'S HOPE WAS THUS TORN BY THE ROOTS OUT OF MY RIVEN OUTRAGED HEART
WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE I KNOW NOT WHEN A LITTLE CHILD THE LEAST
CHILD IN THE SCHOOL BROKE WITH ITS SIMPLICITY AND ITS UNCONSCIOUSNESS
INTO THE RAGING YET SILENT CENTRE OF THAT INWARD CONFLICT
MADEMOISELLE LISPED THE TREBLE VOICE I AM TO GIVE YOU THAT
M
PAUL SAID I WAS TO SEEK YOU ALL OVER THE HOUSE FROM THE GRENIER TO THE
CELLAR AND WHEN I FOUND YOU TO GIVE YOU THAT
AND THE CHILD DELIVERED A NOTE THE LITTLE DOVE DROPPED ON MY KNEE ITS
OLIVE LEAF PLUCKED OFF
I FOUND NEITHER ADDRESS NOR NAME ONLY THESE
WORDS
IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION TO TAKE LEAVE OF YOU WHEN I SAID GOOD BY TO
THE REST BUT I HOPED TO SEE YOU IN CLASSE
I WAS DISAPPOINTED
THE
INTERVIEW IS DEFERRED
BE READY FOR ME
ERE I SAIL I MUST SEE YOU AT
LEISURE AND SPEAK WITH YOU AT LENGTH
BE READY MY MOMENTS ARE
NUMBERED AND JUST NOW MONOPOLIZED BESIDES I HAVE A PRIVATE
BUSINESS ON HAND WHICH I WILL NOT SHARE WITH ANY NOR COMMUNICATE EVEN
TO YOU PAUL
BE READY THEN IT MUST BE THIS EVENING WAS HE NOT TO GO ON THE
MORROW YES OF THAT POINT I WAS CERTAIN
I HAD SEEN THE DATE OF HIS
VESSEL'S DEPARTURE ADVERTISED
OH I WOULD BE READY BUT COULD THAT
LONGED FOR MEETING REALLY BE ACHIEVED THE TIME WAS SO SHORT THE
SCHEMERS SEEMED SO WATCHFUL SO ACTIVE SO HOSTILE THE WAY OF ACCESS
APPEARED STRAIT AS A GULLY DEEP AS A CHASM APOLLYON STRADDLED ACROSS
IT BREATHING FLAMES
COULD MY GREATHEART OVERCOME COULD MY GUIDE
REACH ME
WHO MIGHT TELL YET I BEGAN TO TAKE SOME COURAGE SOME COMFORT IT
SEEMED TO ME THAT I FELT A PULSE OF HIS HEART BEATING YET TRUE TO THE
WHOLE THROB OF MINE
I WAITED MY CHAMPION
APOLLYON CAME TRAILING HIS HELL BEHIND HIM
I
THINK IF ETERNITY HELD TORMENT ITS FORM WOULD NOT BE FIERY RACK NOR
ITS NATURE DESPAIR
I THINK THAT ON A CERTAIN DAY AMONGST THOSE DAYS
WHICH NEVER DAWNED AND WILL NOT SET AN ANGEL ENTERED HADES STOOD
SHONE SMILED DELIVERED A PROPHECY OF CONDITIONAL PARDON KINDLED A
DOUBTFUL HOPE OF BLISS TO COME NOT NOW BUT AT A DAY AND HOUR UNLOOKED
FOR REVEALED IN HIS OWN GLORY AND GRANDEUR THE HEIGHT AND COMPASS OF
HIS PROMISE SPOKE THUS THEN TOWERING BECAME A STAR AND VANISHED
INTO HIS OWN HEAVEN
HIS LEGACY WAS SUSPENSE A WORSE BOON THAN DESPAIR
ALL THAT EVENING I WAITED TRUSTING IN THE DOVE SENT OLIVE LEAF YET IN
THE MIDST OF MY TRUST TERRIBLY FEARING
MY FEAR PRESSED HEAVY
COLD
AND PECULIAR I KNEW IT FOR THE PARTNER OF A RARELY BELIED
PRESENTIMENT
THE FIRST HOURS SEEMED LONG AND SLOW IN SPIRIT I CLUNG
TO THE FLYING SKIRTS OF THE LAST
THEY PASSED LIKE DRIFT CLOUD LIKE
THE WRACK SCUDDING BEFORE A STORM
THEY PASSED
ALL THE LONG HOT SUMMER DAY BURNED AWAY LIKE A YULE LOG
THE CRIMSON OF ITS CLOSE PERISHED I WAS LEFT BENT AMONG THE COOL BLUE
SHADES OVER THE PALE AND ASHEN GLEAMS OF ITS NIGHT
PRAYERS WERE OVER IT WAS BED TIME MY CO INMATES WERE ALL RETIRED
I
STILL REMAINED IN THE GLOOMY FIRST CLASSE FORGETTING OR AT LEAST
DISREGARDING RULES I HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN OR DISREGARDED BEFORE
HOW LONG I PACED THAT CLASSE I CANNOT TELL I MUST HAVE BEEN AFOOT MANY
HOURS MECHANICALLY HAD I MOVED ASIDE BENCHES AND DESKS AND HAD MADE
FOR MYSELF A PATH DOWN ITS LENGTH
THERE I WALKED AND THERE WHEN
CERTAIN THAT THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD WERE ABED AND QUITE OUT OF
HEARING THERE I AT LAST WEPT
RELIANT ON NIGHT CONFIDING IN
SOLITUDE I KEPT MY TEARS SEALED MY SOBS CHAINED NO LONGER THEY
HEAVED MY HEART THEY TORE THEIR WAY
IN THIS HOUSE WHAT GRIEF COULD
BE SACRED
SOON AFTER ELEVEN O'CLOCK A VERY LATE HOUR IN THE RUE FOSSETTE THE
DOOR UNCLOSED QUIETLY BUT NOT STEALTHILY A LAMP'S FLAME INVADED THE
MOONLIGHT MADAME BECK ENTERED WITH THE SAME COMPOSED AIR AS IF
COMING ON AN ORDINARY OCCASION AT AN ORDINARY SEASON
INSTEAD OF AT
ONCE ADDRESSING ME SHE WENT TO HER DESK TOOK HER KEYS AND SEEMED TO
SEEK SOMETHING SHE LOITERED OVER THIS FEIGNED SEARCH LONG TOO LONG
SHE WAS CALM TOO CALM MY MOOD SCARCE ENDURED THE PRETENCE DRIVEN
BEYOND COMMON RANGE TWO HOURS SINCE I HAD LEFT BEHIND ME WONTED
RESPECTS AND FEARS
LED BY A TOUCH AND RULED BY A WORD UNDER USUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES NO YOKE COULD NOW BE BORNE NO CURB OBEYED
IT IS MORE THAN TIME FOR RETIREMENT SAID MADAME THE RULE OF THE
HOUSE HAS ALREADY BEEN TRANSGRESSED TOO LONG
MADAME MET NO ANSWER I DID NOT CHECK MY WALK WHEN SHE CAME IN MY WAY
I PUT HER OUT OF IT
LET ME PERSUADE YOU TO CALM MEESS LET ME LEAD YOU TO YOUR CHAMBER
SAID SHE TRYING TO SPEAK SOFTLY
NO I SAID NEITHER YOU NOR ANOTHER SHALL PERSUADE OR LEAD ME
YOUR BED SHALL BE WARMED
GOTON IS SITTING UP STILL
SHE SHALL MAKE
YOU COMFORTABLE SHE SHALL GIVE YOU A SEDATIVE
MADAME I BROKE OUT YOU ARE A SENSUALIST
UNDER ALL YOUR SERENITY
YOUR PEACE AND YOUR DECORUM YOU ARE AN UNDENIED SENSUALIST
MAKE YOUR
OWN BED WARM AND SOFT TAKE SEDATIVES AND MEATS AND DRINKS SPICED AND
SWEET AS MUCH AS YOU WILL
IF YOU HAVE ANY SORROW OR
DISAPPOINTMENT AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE NAY I KNOW YOU HAVE SEEK
YOUR OWN PALLIATIVES IN YOUR OWN CHOSEN RESOURCES
LEAVE ME HOWEVER
LEAVE ME I SAY
I MUST SEND ANOTHER TO WATCH YOU MEESS I MUST SEND GOTON
I FORBID IT
LET ME ALONE
KEEP YOUR HAND OFF ME AND MY LIFE AND MY
TROUBLES
OH MADAME IN YOUR HAND THERE IS BOTH CHILL AND POISON
YOU ENVENOM AND YOU PARALYZE
WHAT HAVE I DONE MEESS YOU MUST NOT MARRY PAUL
HE CANNOT MARRY
DOG IN THE MANGER I SAID FOR I KNEW SHE SECRETLY WANTED HIM AND
HAD ALWAYS WANTED HIM
SHE CALLED HIM INSUPPORTABLE SHE RAILED AT
HIM FOR A DVOT SHE DID NOT LOVE BUT SHE WANTED TO MARRY THAT SHE
MIGHT BIND HIM TO HER INTEREST
DEEP INTO SOME OF MADAME'S SECRETS I
HAD ENTERED I KNOW NOT HOW BY AN INTUITION OR AN INSPIRATION WHICH
CAME TO ME I KNOW NOT WHENCE
IN THE COURSE OF LIVING WITH HER TOO I
HAD SLOWLY LEARNED THAT UNLESS WITH AN INFERIOR SHE MUST EVER BE A
RIVAL
SHE WAS MY RIVAL HEART AND SOUL THOUGH SECRETLY UNDER THE
SMOOTHEST BEARING AND UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO ALL SAVE HER AND MYSELF
TWO MINUTES I STOOD OVER MADAME FEELING THAT THE WHOLE WOMAN WAS IN MY
POWER BECAUSE IN SOME MOODS SUCH AS THE PRESENT IN SOME STIMULATED
STATES OF PERCEPTION LIKE THAT OF THIS INSTANT HER HABITUAL DISGUISE
HER MASK AND HER DOMINO WERE TO ME A MERE NETWORK RETICULATED WITH
HOLES AND I SAW UNDERNEATH A BEING HEARTLESS SELF INDULGENT AND
IGNOBLE
SHE QUIETLY RETREATED FROM ME MEEK AND SELF POSSESSED THOUGH
VERY UNEASY SHE SAID IF I WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO TAKE REST SHE
MUST RELUCTANTLY LEAVE ME WHICH SHE DID INCONTINENT PERHAPS EVEN
MORE GLAD TO GET AWAY THAN I WAS TO SEE HER VANISH
THIS WAS THE SOLE FLASH ELICITING TRUTH EXTORTING RENCONTRE WHICH
EVER OCCURRED BETWEEN ME AND MADAME BECK THIS SHORT NIGHT SCENE WAS
NEVER REPEATED
IT DID NOT ONE WHIT CHANGE HER MANNER TO ME
I DO NOT
KNOW THAT SHE REVENGED IT
I DO NOT KNOW THAT SHE HATED ME THE WORSE
FOR MY FELL CANDOUR
I THINK SHE BUCKLERED HERSELF WITH THE SECRET
PHILOSOPHY OF HER STRONG MIND AND RESOLVED TO FORGET WHAT IT IRKED HER
TO REMEMBER
I KNOW THAT TO THE END OF OUR MUTUAL LIVES THERE OCCURRED
NO REPETITION OF NO ALLUSION TO THAT FIERY PASSAGE
THAT NIGHT PASSED ALL NIGHTS EVEN THE STARLESS NIGHT BEFORE
DISSOLUTION MUST WEAR AWAY
ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK THE HOUR WHICH CALLED
UP THE HOUSEHOLD I WENT OUT TO THE COURT AND WASHED MY FACE IN ITS
COLD FRESH WELL WATER
ENTERING BY THE CARR A PIECE OF MIRROR GLASS
SET IN AN OAKEN CABINET REPEATED MY IMAGE
IT SAID I WAS CHANGED MY
CHEEKS AND LIPS WERE SODDEN WHITE MY EYES WERE GLASSY AND MY EYELIDS
SWOLLEN AND PURPLE
ON REJOINING MY COMPANIONS I KNEW THEY ALL LOOKED AT ME MY HEART
SEEMED DISCOVERED TO THEM I BELIEVED MYSELF SELF BETRAYED
HIDEOUSLY
CERTAIN DID IT SEEM THAT THE VERY YOUNGEST OF THE SCHOOL MUST GUESS WHY
AND FOR WHOM I DESPAIRED
ISABELLE THE CHILD WHOM I HAD ONCE NURSED IN SICKNESS APPROACHED
ME
WOULD SHE TOO MOCK ME
QUE VOUS TES PLE VOUS TES DONC BIEN MALADE MADEMOISELLE SAID
SHE PUTTING HER FINGER IN HER MOUTH AND STARING WITH A WISTFUL
STUPIDITY WHICH AT THE MOMENT SEEMED TO ME MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE
KEENEST INTELLIGENCE
ISABELLE DID NOT LONG STAND ALONE IN THE RECOMMENDATION OF IGNORANCE
BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER I GATHERED CAUSE OF GRATITUDE TOWARDS THE
WHOLE BLIND HOUSEHOLD
THE MULTITUDE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO THAN TO
READ HEARTS AND INTERPRET DARK SAYINGS
WHO WILLS MAY KEEP HIS OWN
COUNSEL BE HIS OWN SECRET'S SOVEREIGN
IN THE COURSE OF THAT DAY
PROOF MET ME ON PROOF NOT ONLY THAT THE CAUSE OF MY PRESENT SORROW WAS
UNGUESSED BUT THAT MY WHOLE INNER LIFE FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS WAS
STILL MINE ONLY
IT WAS NOT KNOWN IT HAD NOT BEEN NOTED THAT I HELD
IN PECULIAR VALUE ONE LIFE AMONG ALL LIVES
GOSSIP HAD PASSED ME BY
CURIOSITY HAD LOOKED ME OVER BOTH SUBTLE INFLUENCES HOVERING ALWAYS
ROUND HAD NEVER BECOME CENTRED UPON ME
A GIVEN ORGANIZATION MAY LIVE
IN A FULL FEVER HOSPITAL AND ESCAPE TYPHUS
M
EMANUEL HAD COME AND
GONE I HAD BEEN TAUGHT AND SOUGHT IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON HE HAD
CALLED ME AND I HAD OBEYED HIM M
PAUL WANTS MISS LUCY MISS LUCY
IS WITH M
PAUL SUCH HAD BEEN THE PERPETUAL BULLETIN AND NOBODY
COMMENTED FAR LESS CONDEMNED
NOBODY HINTED NOBODY JESTED
MADAME
BECK READ THE RIDDLE NONE ELSE RESOLVED IT
WHAT I NOW SUFFERED WAS
CALLED ILLNESS A HEADACHE I ACCEPTED THE BAPTISM
BUT WHAT BODILY ILLNESS WAS EVER LIKE THIS PAIN THIS CERTAINTY THAT HE
WAS GONE WITHOUT A FAREWELL THIS CRUEL CONVICTION THAT FATE AND
PURSUING FURIES A WOMAN'S ENVY AND A PRIEST'S BIGOTRY WOULD SUFFER ME
TO SEE HIM NO MORE WHAT WONDER THAT THE SECOND EVENING FOUND ME LIKE
THE FIRST UNTAMED TORTURED AGAIN PACING A SOLITARY ROOM IN AN
UNALTERABLE PASSION OF SILENT DESOLATION
MADAME BECK DID NOT HERSELF SUMMON ME TO BED THAT NIGHT SHE DID NOT
COME NEAR ME SHE SENT GINEVRA FANSHAWE A MORE EFFICIENT AGENT FOR THE
PURPOSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE EMPLOYED
GINEVRA'S FIRST WORDS IS YOUR
HEADACHE VERY BAD TO NIGHT FOR GINEVRA LIKE THE REST THOUGHT I HAD
A HEADACHE AN INTOLERABLE HEADACHE WHICH MADE ME FRIGHTFULLY WHITE IN
THE FACE AND INSANELY RESTLESS IN THE FOOT HER FIRST WORDS I SAY
INSPIRED THE IMPULSE TO FLEE ANYWHERE SO THAT IT WERE ONLY OUT OF
REACH
AND SOON WHAT FOLLOWED PLAINTS ABOUT HER OWN
HEADACHES COMPLETED THE BUSINESS
I WENT UP STAIRS
PRESENTLY I WAS IN MY BED MY MISERABLE BED HAUNTED
WITH QUICK SCORPIONS
I HAD NOT BEEN LAID DOWN FIVE MINUTES WHEN
ANOTHER EMISSARY ARRIVED GOTON CAME BRINGING ME SOMETHING TO DRINK
I
WAS CONSUMED WITH THIRST I DRANK EAGERLY THE BEVERAGE WAS SWEET BUT
I TASTED A DRUG
MADAME SAYS IT WILL MAKE YOU SLEEP CHOU CHOU SAID GOTON AS SHE
RECEIVED BACK THE EMPTIED CUP
AH THE SEDATIVE HAD BEEN ADMINISTERED
IN FACT THEY HAD GIVEN ME A
STRONG OPIATE
I WAS TO BE HELD QUIET FOR ONE NIGHT
THE HOUSEHOLD CAME TO BED THE NIGHT LIGHT WAS LIT THE DORMITORY
HUSHED
SLEEP SOON REIGNED OVER THOSE PILLOWS SLEEP WON AN EASY
SUPREMACY CONTENTED SOVEREIGN OVER HEADS AND HEARTS WHICH DID NOT
ACHE HE PASSED BY THE UNQUIET
THE DRUG WROUGHT
I KNOW NOT WHETHER MADAME HAD OVERCHARGED OR
UNDER CHARGED THE DOSE ITS RESULT WAS NOT THAT SHE INTENDED
INSTEAD
OF STUPOR CAME EXCITEMENT
I BECAME ALIVE TO NEW THOUGHT TO REVERIE
PECULIAR IN COLOURING
A GATHERING CALL RAN AMONG THE FACULTIES THEIR
BUGLES SANG THEIR TRUMPETS RANG AN UNTIMELY SUMMONS
IMAGINATION WAS
ROUSED FROM HER REST AND SHE CAME FORTH IMPETUOUS AND VENTUROUS
WITH
SCORN SHE LOOKED ON MATTER HER MATE RISE SHE SAID
SLUGGARD THIS
NIGHT I WILL HAVE MY WILL NOR SHALT THOU PREVAIL
LOOK FORTH AND VIEW THE NIGHT WAS HER CRY AND WHEN I LIFTED THE
HEAVY BLIND FROM THE CASEMENT CLOSE AT HAND WITH HER OWN ROYAL
GESTURE SHE SHOWED ME A MOON SUPREME IN AN ELEMENT DEEP AND SPLENDID
TO MY GASPING SENSES SHE MADE THE GLIMMERING GLOOM THE NARROW LIMITS
THE OPPRESSIVE HEAT OF THE DORMITORY INTOLERABLE
SHE LURED ME TO
LEAVE THIS DEN AND FOLLOW HER FORTH INTO DEW COOLNESS AND GLORY
SHE BROUGHT UPON ME A STRANGE VISION OF VILLETTE AT MIDNIGHT
ESPECIALLY SHE SHOWED THE PARK THE SUMMER PARK WITH ITS LONG ALLEYS
ALL SILENT LONE AND SAFE AMONG THESE LAY A HUGE STONE BASIN THAT
BASIN I KNEW AND BESIDE WHICH I HAD OFTEN STOOD DEEP SET IN THE
TREE SHADOWS BRIMMING WITH COOL WATER CLEAR WITH A GREEN LEAFY
RUSHY BED
WHAT OF ALL THIS THE PARK GATES WERE SHUT UP LOCKED
SENTINELLED THE PLACE COULD NOT BE ENTERED
COULD IT NOT A POINT WORTH CONSIDERING AND WHILE REVOLVING IT I
MECHANICALLY DRESSED
UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF SLEEPING OR LYING
STILL EXCITED FROM HEAD TO FOOT WHAT COULD I DO BETTER THAN DRESS
THE GATES WERE LOCKED SOLDIERS SET BEFORE THEM WAS THERE THEN NO
ADMISSION TO THE PARK
THE OTHER DAY IN WALKING PAST I HAD SEEN WITHOUT THEN ATTENDING TO
THE CIRCUMSTANCE A GAP IN THE PALING ONE STAKE BROKEN DOWN I NOW SAW
THIS GAP AGAIN IN RECOLLECTION SAW IT VERY PLAINLY THE NARROW
IRREGULAR APERTURE VISIBLE BETWEEN THE STEMS OF THE LINDENS PLANTED
ORDERLY AS A COLONNADE
A MAN COULD NOT HAVE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THAT
APERTURE NOR COULD A STOUT WOMAN PERHAPS NOT MADAME BECK BUT I
THOUGHT I MIGHT I FANCIED I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY AND ONCE WITHIN AT
THIS HOUR THE WHOLE PARK WOULD BE MINE THE MOONLIGHT MIDNIGHT PARK
HOW SOUNDLY THE DORMITORY SLEPT WHAT DEEP SLUMBERS WHAT QUIET
BREATHING HOW VERY STILL THE WHOLE LARGE HOUSE WHAT WAS THE TIME I
FELT RESTLESS TO KNOW
THERE STOOD A CLOCK IN THE CLASSE BELOW WHAT
HINDERED ME FROM VENTURING DOWN TO CONSULT IT BY SUCH A MOON ITS
LARGE WHITE FACE AND JET BLACK FIGURES MUST BE VIVIDLY DISTINCT
AS FOR HINDRANCE TO THIS STEP THERE OFFERED NOT SO MUCH AS A CREAKING
HINGE OR A CLICKING LATCH
ON THESE HOT JULY NIGHTS CLOSE AIR COULD
NOT BE TOLERATED AND THE CHAMBER DOOR STOOD WIDE OPEN
WILL THE
DORMITORY PLANKS SUSTAIN MY TREAD UNTRAITOROUS YES
I KNOW WHEREVER A
BOARD IS LOOSE AND WILL AVOID IT
THE OAK STAIRCASE CREAKS SOMEWHAT AS
I DESCEND BUT NOT MUCH I AM IN THE CARR
THE GREAT CLASSE DOORS ARE CLOSE SHUT THEY ARE BOLTED
ON THE OTHER
HAND THE ENTRANCE TO THE CORRIDOR STANDS OPEN
THE CLASSES SEEM TO MY
THOUGHT GREAT DREARY JAILS BURIED FAR BACK BEYOND THOROUGHFARES AND
FOR ME FILLED WITH SPECTRAL AND INTOLERABLE MEMORIES LAID MISERABLE
AMONGST THEIR STRAW AND THEIR MANACLES
THE CORRIDOR OFFERS A CHEERFUL
VISTA LEADING TO THE HIGH VESTIBULE WHICH OPENS DIRECT UPON THE STREET
HUSH THE CLOCK STRIKES
GHOSTLY DEEP AS IS THE STILLNESS OF THIS
CONVENT IT IS ONLY ELEVEN
WHILE MY EAR FOLLOWS TO SILENCE THE HUM OF
THE LAST STROKE I CATCH FAINTLY FROM THE BUILT OUT CAPITAL A SOUND
LIKE BELLS OR LIKE A BAND A SOUND WHERE SWEETNESS WHERE VICTORY
WHERE MOURNING BLEND
OH TO APPROACH THIS MUSIC NEARER TO LISTEN TO
IT ALONE BY THE RUSHY BASIN LET ME GO OH LET ME GO WHAT HINDERS
WHAT DOES NOT AID FREEDOM
THERE IN THE CORRIDOR HANGS MY GARDEN COSTUME MY LARGE HAT MY
SHAWL
THERE IS NO LOCK ON THE HUGE HEAVY PORTE COCHRE THERE IS NO
KEY TO SEEK IT FASTENS WITH A SORT OF SPRING BOLT NOT TO BE OPENED
FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT WHICH FROM WITHIN MAY BE NOISELESSLY WITHDRAWN
CAN I MANAGE IT IT YIELDS TO MY HAND YIELDS WITH PROPITIOUS FACILITY
I WONDER AS THAT PORTAL SEEMS ALMOST SPONTANEOUSLY TO UNCLOSE I WONDER
AS I CROSS THE THRESHOLD AND STEP ON THE PAVED STREET WONDER AT THE
STRANGE EASE WITH WHICH THIS PRISON HAS BEEN FORCED
IT SEEMS AS IF I
HAD BEEN PIONEERED INVISIBLY AS IF SOME DISSOLVING FORCE HAD GONE
BEFORE ME FOR MYSELF I HAVE SCARCE MADE AN EFFORT
QUIET RUE FOSSETTE I FIND ON THIS PAVEMENT THAT WANDERER WOOING SUMMER
NIGHT OF WHICH I MUSED I SEE ITS MOON OVER ME I FEEL ITS DEW IN THE
AIR
BUT HERE I CANNOT STAY I AM STILL TOO NEAR OLD HAUNTS SO CLOSE
UNDER THE DUNGEON I CAN HEAR THE PRISONERS MOAN
THIS SOLEMN PEACE IS
NOT WHAT I SEEK IT IS NOT WHAT I CAN BEAR TO ME THE FACE OF THAT SKY
BEARS THE ASPECT OF A WORLD'S DEATH
THE PARK ALSO WILL BE CALM I
KNOW A MORTAL SERENITY PREVAILS EVERYWHERE YET LET ME SEEK THE PARK
I TOOK A ROUTE WELL KNOWN AND WENT UP TOWARDS THE PALATIAL AND ROYAL
HAUTE VILLE THENCE THE MUSIC I HAD HEARD CERTAINLY FLOATED IT WAS
HUSHED NOW BUT IT MIGHT RE WAKEN
I WENT ON NEITHER BAND NOR BELL
MUSIC CAME TO MEET ME ANOTHER SOUND REPLACED IT A SOUND LIKE A STRONG
TIDE A GREAT FLOW DEEPENING AS I PROCEEDED
LIGHT BROKE MOVEMENT
GATHERED CHIMES PEALED TO WHAT WAS I COMING ENTERING ON THE LEVEL OF
A GRANDE PLACE I FOUND MYSELF WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF MAGIC PLUNGED
AMIDST A GAY LIVING JOYOUS CROWD
VILLETTE IS ONE BLAZE ONE BROAD ILLUMINATION THE WHOLE WORLD SEEMS
ABROAD MOONLIGHT AND HEAVEN ARE BANISHED THE TOWN BY HER OWN
FLAMBEAUX BEHOLDS HER OWN SPLENDOUR GAY DRESSES GRAND EQUIPAGES
FINE HORSES AND GALLANT RIDERS THRONG THE BRIGHT STREETS
I SEE EVEN
SCORES OF MASKS
IT IS A STRANGE SCENE STRANGER THAN DREAMS
BUT WHERE
IS THE PARK I OUGHT TO BE NEAR IT
IN THE MIDST OF THIS GLARE THE
PARK MUST BE SHADOWY AND CALM THERE AT LEAST ARE NEITHER TORCHES
LAMPS NOR CROWD
I WAS ASKING THIS QUESTION WHEN AN OPEN CARRIAGE PASSED ME FILLED WITH
KNOWN FACES
THROUGH THE DEEP THRONG IT COULD PASS BUT SLOWLY THE
SPIRITED HORSES FRETTED IN THEIR CURBED ARDOUR
I SAW THE OCCUPANTS OF
THAT CARRIAGE WELL ME THEY COULD NOT SEE OR AT LEAST NOT KNOW
FOLDED CLOSE IN MY LARGE SHAWL SCREENED WITH MY STRAW HAT IN THAT
MOTLEY CROWD NO DRESS WAS NOTICEABLY STRANGE
I SAW THE COUNT DE
BASSOMPIERRE I SAW MY GODMOTHER HANDSOMELY APPARELLED COMELY AND
CHEERFUL I SAW TOO PAULINA MARY COMPASSED WITH THE TRIPLE HALO OF
HER BEAUTY HER YOUTH AND HER HAPPINESS
IN LOOKING ON HER COUNTENANCE
OF JOY AND EYES OF FESTAL LIGHT ONE SCARCE REMEMBERED TO NOTE THE
GALA ELEGANCE OF WHAT SHE WORE I KNOW ONLY THAT THE DRAPERY FLOATING
ABOUT HER WAS ALL WHITE AND LIGHT AND BRIDAL SEATED OPPOSITE TO HER I
SAW GRAHAM BRETTON IT WAS IN LOOKING UP AT HIM HER ASPECT HAD CAUGHT
ITS LUSTRE THE LIGHT REPEATED IN HER EYES BEAMED FIRST OUT OF HIS
IT GAVE ME STRANGE PLEASURE TO FOLLOW THESE FRIENDS VIEWLESSLY AND I
DID FOLLOW THEM AS I THOUGHT TO THE PARK
I WATCHED THEM ALIGHT
CARRIAGES WERE INADMISSIBLE AMIDST NEW AND UNANTICIPATED SPLENDOURS
LO THE IRON GATEWAY BETWEEN THE STONE COLUMNS WAS SPANNED BY A
FLAMING ARCH BUILT OF MASSED STARS AND FOLLOWING THEM CAUTIOUSLY
BENEATH THAT ARCH WHERE WERE THEY AND WHERE WAS I
IN A LAND OF ENCHANTMENT A GARDEN MOST GORGEOUS A PLAIN SPRINKLED
WITH COLOURED METEORS A FOREST WITH SPARKS OF PURPLE AND RUBY AND
GOLDEN FIRE GEMMING THE FOLIAGE A REGION NOT OF TREES AND SHADOW BUT
OF STRANGEST ARCHITECTURAL WEALTH OF ALTAR AND OF TEMPLE OF PYRAMID
OBELISK AND SPHINX INCREDIBLE TO SAY THE WONDERS AND THE SYMBOLS OF
EGYPT TEEMED THROUGHOUT THE PARK OF VILLETTE
NO MATTER THAT IN FIVE MINUTES THE SECRET WAS MINE THE KEY OF THE
MYSTERY PICKED UP AND ITS ILLUSION UNVEILED NO MATTER THAT I QUICKLY
RECOGNISED THE MATERIAL OF THESE SOLEMN FRAGMENTS THE TIMBER THE
PAINT AND THE PASTEBOARD THESE INEVITABLE DISCOVERIES FAILED TO QUITE
DESTROY THE CHARM OR UNDERMINE THE MARVEL OF THAT NIGHT
NO MATTER
THAT I NOW SEIZED THE EXPLANATION OF THE WHOLE GREAT FTE A FTE OF
WHICH THE CONVENTUAL RUE FOSSETTE HAD NOT TASTED THOUGH IT HAD OPENED
AT DAWN THAT MORNING AND WAS STILL IN FULL VIGOUR NEAR MIDNIGHT
IN PAST DAYS THERE HAD BEEN SAID HISTORY AN AWFUL CRISIS IN THE FATE
OF LABASSECOUR INVOLVING I KNOW NOT WHAT PERIL TO THE RIGHTS AND
LIBERTIES OF HER GALLANT CITIZENS
RUMOURS OF WARS THERE HAD BEEN IF
NOT WARS THEMSELVES A KIND OF STRUGGLING IN THE STREETS A BUSTLE A
RUNNING TO AND FRO SOME REARING OF BARRICADES SOME BURGHER RIOTING
SOME CALLING OUT OF TROOPS MUCH INTERCHANGE OF BRICKBATS AND EVEN A
LITTLE OF SHOT
TRADITION HELD THAT PATRIOTS HAD FALLEN IN THE OLD
BASSE VILLE WAS SHOWN AN ENCLOSURE SOLEMNLY BUILT IN AND SET APART
HOLDING IT WAS SAID THE SACRED BONES OF MARTYRS
BE THIS AS IT MAY A
CERTAIN DAY IN THE YEAR WAS STILL KEPT AS A FESTIVAL IN HONOUR OF THE
SAID PATRIOTS AND MARTYRS OF SOMEWHAT APOCRYPHAL MEMORY THE MORNING
BEING GIVEN TO A SOLEMN TE DEUM IN ST
JEAN BAPTISTE THE EVENING
DEVOTED TO SPECTACLES DECORATIONS AND ILLUMINATIONS SUCH AS THESE I
NOW SAW
WHILE LOOKING UP AT THE IMAGE OF A WHITE IBIS FIXED ON A COLUMN WHILE
FATHOMING THE DEEP TORCH LIT PERSPECTIVE OF AN AVENUE AT THE CLOSE OF
WHICH WAS COUCHED A SPHINX I LOST SIGHT OF THE PARTY WHICH FROM THE
MIDDLE OF THE GREAT SQUARE I HAD FOLLOWED OR RATHER THEY VANISHED
LIKE A GROUP OF APPARITIONS
ON THIS WHOLE SCENE WAS IMPRESSED A
DREAM LIKE CHARACTER EVERY SHAPE WAS WAVERING EVERY MOVEMENT
FLOATING EVERY VOICE ECHO LIKE HALF MOCKING HALF UNCERTAIN
PAULINA
AND HER FRIENDS BEING GONE I SCARCE COULD AVOUCH THAT I HAD REALLY
SEEN THEM NOR DID I MISS THEM AS GUIDES THROUGH THE CHAOS FAR LESS
REGRET THEM AS PROTECTORS AMIDST THE NIGHT
THAT FESTAL NIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE FOR A VERY CHILD
HALF THE
PEASANTRY HAD COME IN FROM THE OUTLYING ENVIRONS OF VILLETTE AND THE
DECENT BURGHERS WERE ALL ABROAD AND AROUND DRESSED IN THEIR BEST
MY
STRAW HAT PASSED AMIDST CAP AND JACKET SHORT PETTICOAT AND LONG
CALICO MANTLE WITHOUT PERHAPS ATTRACTING A GLANCE I ONLY TOOK THE
PRECAUTION TO BIND DOWN THE BROAD LEAF GIPSY WISE WITH A SUPPLEMENTARY
RIBBON AND THEN I FELT SAFE AS IF MASKED
SAFE I PASSED DOWN THE AVENUES SAFE I MIXED WITH THE CROWD WHERE IT
WAS DEEPEST
TO BE STILL WAS NOT IN MY POWER NOR QUIETLY TO OBSERVE
I
TOOK A REVEL OF THE SCENE I DRANK THE ELASTIC NIGHT AIR THE SWELL OF
SOUND THE DUBIOUS LIGHT NOW FLASHING NOW FADING
AS TO HAPPINESS OR
HOPE THEY AND I HAD SHAKEN HANDS BUT JUST NOW I SCORNED DESPAIR
MY VAGUE AIM AS I WENT WAS TO FIND THE STONE BASIN WITH ITS CLEAR
DEPTH AND GREEN LINING OF THAT COOLNESS AND VERDURE I THOUGHT WITH
THE PASSIONATE THIRST OF UNCONSCIOUS FEVER
AMIDST THE GLARE AND
HURRY AND THRONG AND NOISE I STILL SECRETLY AND CHIEFLY LONGED TO
COME ON THAT CIRCULAR MIRROR OF CRYSTAL AND SURPRISE THE MOON GLASSING
THEREIN HER PEARLY FRONT
I KNEW MY ROUTE YET IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS HINDERED FROM PURSUING IT
DIRECT NOW A SIGHT AND NOW A SOUND CALLED ME ASIDE LURING ME DOWN
THIS ALLEY AND DOWN THAT
ALREADY I SAW THE THICK PLANTED TREES WHICH
FRAMED THIS TREMULOUS AND RIPPLED GLASS WHEN CHOIRING OUT OF A GLADE
TO THE RIGHT BROKE SUCH A SOUND AS I THOUGHT MIGHT BE HEARD IF HEAVEN
WERE TO OPEN SUCH A SOUND PERHAPS AS WAS HEARD ABOVE THE PLAIN OF
BETHLEHEM ON THE NIGHT OF GLAD TIDINGS
THE SONG THE SWEET MUSIC ROSE AFAR BUT RUSHING SWIFTLY ON
FAST STRENGTHENING PINIONS THERE SWEPT THROUGH THESE SHADES SO FULL A
STORM OF HARMONIES THAT HAD NO TREE BEEN NEAR AGAINST WHICH TO LEAN I
THINK I MUST HAVE DROPPED
VOICES WERE THERE IT SEEMED TO ME
UNNUMBERED INSTRUMENTS VARIED AND COUNTLESS BUGLE HORN AND TRUMPET
I KNEW
THE EFFECT WAS AS A SEA BREAKING INTO SONG WITH ALL ITS WAVES
THE SWAYING TIDE SWEPT THIS WAY AND THEN IT FELL BACK AND I FOLLOWED
ITS RETREAT
IT LED ME TOWARDS A BYZANTINE BUILDING A SORT OF KIOSK
NEAR THE PARK'S CENTRE
ROUND ABOUT STOOD CROWDED THOUSANDS GATHERED
TO A GRAND CONCERT IN THE OPEN AIR
WHAT I HAD HEARD WAS I THINK A
WILD JGER CHORUS THE NIGHT THE SPACE THE SCENE AND MY OWN MOOD
HAD BUT ENHANCED THE SOUNDS AND THEIR IMPRESSION
HERE WERE ASSEMBLED LADIES LOOKING BY THIS LIGHT MOST BEAUTIFUL SOME
OF THEIR DRESSES WERE GAUZY AND SOME HAD THE SHEEN OF SATIN THE
FLOWERS AND THE BLOND TREMBLED AND THE VEILS WAVED ABOUT THEIR
DECORATED BONNETS AS THAT HOST LIKE CHORUS WITH ITS GREATLY GATHERING
SOUND SUNDERED THE AIR ABOVE THEM
MOST OF THESE LADIES OCCUPIED THE
LITTLE LIGHT PARK CHAIRS AND BEHIND AND BESIDE THEM STOOD GUARDIAN
GENTLEMEN
THE OUTER RANKS OF THE CROWD WERE MADE UP OF CITIZENS
PLEBEIANS AND POLICE
IN THIS OUTER RANK I TOOK MY PLACE
I RATHER LIKED TO FIND MYSELF THE
SILENT UNKNOWN CONSEQUENTLY UNACCOSTED NEIGHBOUR OF THE SHORT
PETTICOAT AND THE SABOT AND ONLY THE DISTANT GAZER AT THE SILK ROBE
THE VELVET MANTLE AND THE PLUMED CHAPEAU
AMIDST SO MUCH LIFE AND JOY
TOO IT SUITED ME TO BE ALONE QUITE ALONE
HAVING NEITHER WISH NOR
POWER TO FORCE MY WAY THROUGH A MASS SO CLOSE PACKED MY STATION WAS ON
THE FARTHEST CONFINES WHERE INDEED I MIGHT HEAR BUT COULD SEE
LITTLE
MADEMOISELLE IS NOT WELL PLACED SAID A VOICE AT MY ELBOW
WHO DARED
ACCOST ME A BEING IN A MOOD SO LITTLE SOCIAL I TURNED RATHER TO
REPEL THAN TO REPLY
I SAW A MAN A BURGHER AN ENTIRE STRANGER AS I
DEEMED HIM FOR ONE MOMENT BUT THE NEXT RECOGNISED IN HIM A CERTAIN
TRADESMAN A BOOKSELLER WHOSE SHOP FURNISHED THE RUE FOSSETTE WITH ITS
BOOKS AND STATIONERY A MAN NOTORIOUS IN OUR PENSIONNAT FOR THE
EXCESSIVE BRITTLENESS OF HIS TEMPER AND FREQUENT SNAPPISHNESS OF HIS
MANNER EVEN TO US HIS PRINCIPAL CUSTOMERS BUT WHOM FOR MY SOLITARY
SELF I HAD EVER BEEN DISPOSED TO LIKE AND HAD ALWAYS FOUND CIVIL
SOMETIMES KIND ONCE IN AIDING ME ABOUT SOME TROUBLESOME LITTLE
EXCHANGE OF FOREIGN MONEY HE HAD DONE ME A SERVICE
HE WAS AN
INTELLIGENT MAN UNDER HIS ASPERITY HE WAS A GOOD HEARTED MAN THE
THOUGHT HAD SOMETIMES CROSSED ME THAT A PART OF HIS NATURE BORE
AFFINITY TO A PART OF M
EMANUEL'S WHOM HE KNEW WELL AND WHOM I HAD
OFTEN SEEN SITTING ON MIRET'S COUNTER TURNING OVER THE CURRENT MONTH'S
PUBLICATIONS AND IT WAS IN THIS AFFINITY I READ THE EXPLANATION OF
THAT CONCILIATORY FEELING WITH WHICH I INSTINCTIVELY REGARDED HIM
STRANGE TO SAY THIS MAN KNEW ME UNDER MY STRAW HAT AND CLOSELY FOLDED
SHAWL AND THOUGH I DEPRECATED THE EFFORT HE INSISTED ON MAKING A WAY
FOR ME THROUGH THE CROWD AND FINDING ME A BETTER SITUATION
HE CARRIED
HIS DISINTERESTED CIVILITY FURTHER AND FROM SOME QUARTER PROCURED ME
A CHAIR
ONCE AND AGAIN I HAVE FOUND THAT THE MOST CROSS GRAINED ARE
BY NO MEANS THE WORST OF MANKIND NOR THE HUMBLEST IN STATION THE
LEAST POLISHED IN FEELING
THIS MAN IN HIS COURTESY SEEMED TO FIND
NOTHING STRANGE IN MY BEING HERE ALONE ONLY A REASON FOR EXTENDING TO
ME AS FAR AS HE COULD A RETIRING YET EFFICIENT ATTENTION
HAVING
SECURED ME A PLACE AND A SEAT HE WITHDREW WITHOUT ASKING A QUESTION
WITHOUT OBTRUDING A REMARK WITHOUT ADDING A SUPERFLUOUS WORD
NO
WONDER THAT PROFESSOR EMANUEL LIKED TO TAKE HIS CIGAR AND HIS LOUNGE
AND TO READ HIS FEUILLETON IN M
MIRET'S SHOP THE TWO MUST HAVE SUITED
I HAD NOT BEEN SEATED FIVE MINUTES ERE I BECAME AWARE THAT CHANCE AND
MY WORTHY BURGHER FRIEND HAD BROUGHT ME ONCE MORE WITHIN VIEW OF A
FAMILIAR AND DOMESTIC GROUP
RIGHT BEFORE ME SAT THE BRETTONS AND DE
BASSOMPIERRES
WITHIN REACH OF MY HAND HAD I CHOSEN TO EXTEND IT SAT
A FIGURE LIKE A FAIRY QUEEN WHOSE ARRAY LILIES AND THEIR LEAVES
SEEMED TO HAVE SUGGESTED WHATEVER WAS NOT SPOTLESS WHITE BEING
FOREST GREEN
MY GODMOTHER TOO SAT SO NEAR THAT HAD I LEANED
FORWARD MY BREATH MIGHT HAVE STIRRED THE RIBBON OF HER BONNET
THEY
WERE TOO NEAR HAVING BEEN JUST RECOGNISED BY A COMPARATIVE STRANGER I
FELT UNEASY AT THIS CLOSE VICINAGE OF INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE
IT MADE ME QUITE START WHEN MRS
BRETTON TURNING TO MR
HOME AND
SPEAKING OUT OF A KIND IMPULSE OF MEMORY SAID I WONDER WHAT MY
STEADY LITTLE LUCY WOULD SAY TO ALL THIS IF SHE WERE HERE I WISH WE
HAD BROUGHT HER SHE WOULD HAVE ENJOYED IT MUCH
SO SHE WOULD SO SHE WOULD IN HER GRAVE SENSIBLE FASHION IT IS A
PITY BUT WE HAD ASKED HER REJOINED THE KIND GENTLEMAN AND ADDED I
LIKE TO SEE HER SO QUIETLY PLEASED SO LITTLE MOVED YET SO CONTENT
DEAR WERE THEY BOTH TO ME DEAR ARE THEY TO THIS DAY IN THEIR
REMEMBERED BENEVOLENCE
LITTLE KNEW THEY THE RACK OF PAIN WHICH HAD
DRIVEN LUCY ALMOST INTO FEVER AND BROUGHT HER OUT GUIDELESS AND
RECKLESS URGED AND DRUGGED TO THE BRINK OF FRENZY
I HAD HALF A MIND
TO BEND OVER THE ELDERS' SHOULDERS AND ANSWER THEIR GOODNESS WITH THE
THANKS OF MY EYES
M
DE BASSOMPIERRE DID NOT WELL KNOW ME BUT I
KNEW HIM AND HONOURED AND ADMIRED HIS NATURE WITH ALL ITS PLAIN
SINCERITY ITS WARM AFFECTION AND UNCONSCIOUS ENTHUSIASM
POSSIBLY I
MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN BUT JUST THEN GRAHAM TURNED HE TURNED WITH ONE OF
HIS STATELY FIRM MOVEMENTS SO DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF A
SHARP TEMPERED UNDER SIZED MAN THERE WAS BEHIND HIM A THRONG A
HUNDRED RANKS DEEP THERE WERE THOUSANDS TO MEET HIS EYE AND DIVIDE ITS
SCRUTINY WHY THEN DID HE CONCENTRATE ALL ON ME OPPRESSING ME WITH THE
WHOLE FORCE OF THAT FULL BLUE STEADFAST ORB WHY IF HE WOULD LOOK
DID NOT ONE GLANCE SATISFY HIM WHY DID HE TURN ON HIS CHAIR REST HIS
ELBOW ON ITS BACK AND STUDY ME LEISURELY HE COULD NOT SEE MY FACE I
HELD IT DOWN SURELY HE COULD NOT RECOGNISE ME I STOOPED I TURNED
I WOULD NOT BE KNOWN
HE ROSE BY SOME MEANS HE CONTRIVED TO
APPROACH IN TWO MINUTES HE WOULD HAVE HAD MY SECRET MY IDENTITY WOULD
HAVE BEEN GRASPED BETWEEN HIS NEVER TYRANNOUS BUT ALWAYS POWERFUL
HANDS
THERE WAS BUT ONE WAY TO EVADE OR TO CHECK HIM
I IMPLIED BY A
SORT OF SUPPLICATORY GESTURE THAT IT WAS MY PRAYER TO BE LET ALONE
AFTER THAT HAD HE PERSISTED HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE SEEN THE SPECTACLE
OF LUCY INCENSED NOT ALL THAT WAS GRAND OR GOOD OR KIND IN HIM AND
LUCY FELT THE FULL AMOUNT SHOULD HAVE KEPT HER QUITE TAME OR
ABSOLUTELY INOFFENSIVE AND SHADOWLIKE
HE LOOKED BUT HE DESISTED
HE
SHOOK HIS HANDSOME HEAD BUT HE WAS MUTE
HE RESUMED HIS SEAT NOR DID
HE AGAIN TURN OR DISTURB ME BY A GLANCE EXCEPT INDEED FOR ONE SINGLE
INSTANT WHEN A LOOK RATHER SOLICITOUS THAN CURIOUS STOLE MY
WAY SPEAKING WHAT SOMEHOW STILLED MY HEART LIKE THE SOUTH WIND
QUIETING THE EARTH GRAHAM'S THOUGHTS OF ME WERE NOT ENTIRELY THOSE OF
A FROZEN INDIFFERENCE AFTER ALL
I BELIEVE IN THAT GOODLY MANSION HIS
HEART HE KEPT ONE LITTLE PLACE UNDER THE SKY LIGHTS WHERE LUCY MIGHT
HAVE ENTERTAINMENT IF SHE CHOSE TO CALL
IT WAS NOT SO HANDSOME AS THE
CHAMBERS WHERE HE LODGED HIS MALE FRIENDS IT WAS NOT LIKE THE HALL
WHERE HE ACCOMMODATED HIS PHILANTHROPY OR THE LIBRARY WHERE HE
TREASURED HIS SCIENCE STILL LESS DID IT RESEMBLE THE PAVILION WHERE
HIS MARRIAGE FEAST WAS SPLENDIDLY SPREAD YET GRADUALLY BY LONG AND
EQUAL KINDNESS HE PROVED TO ME THAT HE KEPT ONE LITTLE CLOSET OVER
THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS WRITTEN LUCY'S ROOM I KEPT A PLACE FOR HIM
TOO A PLACE OF WHICH I NEVER TOOK THE MEASURE EITHER BY RULE OR
COMPASS I THINK IT WAS LIKE THE TENT OF PERI BANOU
ALL MY LIFE LONG I
CARRIED IT FOLDED IN THE HOLLOW OF MY HAND YET RELEASED FROM THAT HOLD
AND CONSTRICTION I KNOW NOT BUT ITS INNATE CAPACITY FOR EXPANSE MIGHT
HAVE MAGNIFIED IT INTO A TABERNACLE FOR A HOST
FORBEARING AS HE WAS TO NIGHT I COULD NOT STAY IN THIS PROXIMITY THIS
DANGEROUS PLACE AND SEAT MUST BE GIVEN UP I WATCHED MY OPPORTUNITY
ROSE AND STOLE AWAY
HE MIGHT THINK HE MIGHT EVEN BELIEVE THAT LUCY
WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THAT SHAWL AND SHELTERED UNDER THAT HAT HE NEVER
COULD BE CERTAIN FOR HE DID NOT SEE MY FACE
SURELY THE SPIRIT OF RESTLESSNESS WAS BY THIS TIME APPEASED HAD I NOT
HAD ENOUGH OF ADVENTURE DID I NOT BEGIN TO FLAG QUAIL AND WISH FOR
SAFETY UNDER A ROOF NOT SO
I STILL LOATHED MY BED IN THE SCHOOL
DORMITORY MORE THAN WORDS CAN EXPRESS I CLUNG TO WHATEVER COULD
DISTRACT THOUGHT
SOMEHOW I FELT TOO THAT THE NIGHT'S DRAMA WAS BUT
BEGUN THAT THE PROLOGUE WAS SCARCE SPOKEN THROUGHOUT THIS WOODY AND
TURFY THEATRE REIGNED A SHADOW OF MYSTERY ACTORS AND INCIDENTS
UNLOOKED FOR WAITED BEHIND THE SCENES I THOUGHT SO FOREBODING TOLD ME
AS MUCH
STRAYING AT RANDOM OBEYING THE PUSH OF EVERY CHANCE ELBOW I WAS
BROUGHT TO A QUARTER WHERE TREES PLANTED IN CLUSTERS OR TOWERING
SINGLY BROKE UP SOMEWHAT THE DENSE PACKING OF THE CROWD AND GAVE IT A
MORE SCATTERED CHARACTER
THESE CONFINES WERE FAR FROM THE MUSIC AND
SOMEWHAT ALOOF EVEN FROM THE LAMPS BUT THERE WAS SOUND ENOUGH TO
SOOTHE AND WITH THAT FULL HIGH MOON LAMPS WERE SCARCE NEEDED
HERE
HAD CHIEFLY SETTLED FAMILY GROUPS BURGHER PARENTS SOME OF THEM LATE
AS WAS THE HOUR ACTUALLY SURROUNDED BY THEIR CHILDREN WITH WHOM IT
HAD NOT BEEN THOUGHT ADVISABLE TO VENTURE INTO THE CLOSER THRONG
THREE FINE TALL TREES GROWING CLOSE ALMOST TWINED STEM WITHIN STEM
LIFTED A THICK CANOPY OF SHADE ABOVE A GREEN KNOLL CROWNED WITH A
SEAT A SEAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE HELD SEVERAL YET IT SEEMED ABANDONED TO
ONE THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE FORTUNATE PARTY IN POSSESSION OF THIS
SITE STANDING DUTIFULLY ROUND YET AMONGST THIS REVEREND CIRCLE WAS A
LADY HOLDING BY THE HAND A LITTLE GIRL
WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF THIS LITTLE GIRL SHE WAS TWISTING HERSELF ROUND
ON HER HEEL SWINGING FROM HER CONDUCTRESS'S HAND FLINGING HERSELF
FROM SIDE TO SIDE WITH WANTON AND FANTASTIC GYRATIONS
THESE PERVERSE
MOVEMENTS ARRESTED MY ATTENTION THEY STRUCK ME AS OF A CHARACTER
FEARFULLY FAMILIAR
ON CLOSE INSPECTION NO LESS SO APPEARED THE
CHILD'S EQUIPMENT THE LILAC SILK PELISSE THE SMALL SWANSDOWN BOA THE
WHITE BONNET THE WHOLE HOLIDAY TOILETTE IN SHORT WAS THE GALA GARB
OF A CHERUB BUT TOO WELL KNOWN OF THAT TADPOLE DSIRE BECK AND
DSIRE BECK IT WAS SHE OR AN IMP IN HER LIKENESS
I MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THIS DISCOVERY AS A THUNDER CLAP BUT SUCH HYPERBOLE
WOULD HAVE BEEN PREMATURE DISCOVERY WAS DESTINED TO RISE MORE THAN ONE
DEGREE ERE IT REACHED ITS CLIMAX
ON WHOSE HAND COULD THE AMIABLE DSIRE SWING THUS SELFISHLY WHOSE
GLOVE COULD SHE TEAR THUS RECKLESSLY WHOSE ARM THUS STRAIN WITH
IMPUNITY OR ON THE BORDERS OF WHOSE DRESS THUS TURN AND TRAMPLE
INSOLENTLY IF NOT THE HAND GLOVE ARM AND ROBE OF HER LADY MOTHER
AND THERE IN AN INDIAN SHAWL AND A PALE GREEN CRAPE BONNET THERE
FRESH PORTLY BLITHE AND PLEASANT THERE STOOD MADAME BECK
CURIOUS I HAD CERTAINLY DEEMED MADAME IN HER BED AND DSIRE IN HER
CRIB AT THIS BLESSED MINUTE SLEEPING BOTH OF THEM THE SLEEP OF THE
JUST WITHIN THE SACRED WALLS AMIDST THE PROFOUND SECLUSION OF THE RUE
FOSSETTE
MOST CERTAINLY ALSO THEY DID NOT PICTURE MEESS LUCIE
OTHERWISE ENGAGED AND HERE WE ALL THREE WERE TAKING OUR BATS IN THE
FTE BLAZING PARK AT MIDNIGHT
THE FACT WAS MADAME WAS ONLY ACTING ACCORDING TO HER QUITE JUSTIFIABLE
WONT
I REMEMBERED NOW I HAD HEARD IT SAID AMONG THE TEACHERS THOUGH
WITHOUT AT THE TIME PARTICULARLY NOTICING THE GOSSIP THAT OFTEN WHEN
WE THOUGHT MADAME IN HER CHAMBER SLEEPING SHE WAS GONE FULL DRESSED
TO TAKE HER PLEASURE AT OPERAS OR PLAYS OR BALLS
MADAME HAD NO SORT
OF TASTE FOR A MONASTIC LIFE AND TOOK CARE LARGELY THOUGH
DISCREETLY TO SEASON HER EXISTENCE WITH A RELISH OF THE WORLD
HALF A DOZEN GENTLEMEN OF HER FRIENDS STOOD ABOUT HER
AMONGST THESE I
WAS NOT SLOW TO RECOGNISE TWO OR THREE
THERE WAS HER BROTHER M
VICTOR KINT THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON MOUSTACHED AND WITH LONG HAIR A
CALM TACITURN MAN BUT WHOSE TRAITS BORE A STAMP AND A SEMBLANCE I
COULD NOT MARK UNMOVED
AMIDST RESERVE AND PHLEGM AMIDST CONTRASTS OF
CHARACTER AND OF COUNTENANCE SOMETHING THERE STILL WAS WHICH RECALLED
A FACE MOBILE FERVENT FEELING A FACE CHANGEABLE NOW CLOUDED AND
NOW ALIGHT A FACE FROM MY WORLD TAKEN AWAY FOR MY EYES LOST BUT
WHERE MY BEST SPRING HOURS OF LIFE HAD ALTERNATED IN SHADOW AND IN
GLOW THAT FACE WHERE I HAD OFTEN SEEN MOVEMENTS SO NEAR THE SIGNS OF
GENIUS THAT WHY THERE DID NOT SHINE FULLY OUT THE UNDOUBTED FIRE THE
THING THE SPIRIT AND THE SECRET ITSELF I COULD NEVER TELL
YES THIS
JOSEF EMANUEL THIS MAN OF PEACE REMINDED ME OF HIS ARDENT BROTHER
BESIDES MESSIEURS VICTOR AND JOSEF I KNEW ANOTHER OF THIS PARTY
THIS
THIRD PERSON STOOD BEHIND AND IN THE SHADE HIS ATTITUDE TOO WAS
STOOPING YET HIS DRESS AND BALD WHITE HEAD MADE HIM THE MOST
CONSPICUOUS FIGURE OF THE GROUP
HE WAS AN ECCLESIASTIC HE WAS PRE
SILAS
DO NOT FANCY READER THAT THERE WAS ANY INCONSISTENCY IN THE
PRIEST'S PRESENCE AT THIS FTE
THIS WAS NOT CONSIDERED A SHOW OF
VANITY FAIR BUT A COMMEMORATION OF PATRIOTIC SACRIFICE
THE CHURCH
PATRONISED IT EVEN WITH OSTENTATION
THERE WERE TROOPS OF PRIESTS IN
THE PARK THAT NIGHT
PRE SILAS STOOPED OVER THE SEAT WITH ITS SINGLE OCCUPANT THE RUSTIC
BENCH AND THAT WHICH SAT UPON IT A STRANGE MASS IT WAS BEARING NO
SHAPE YET MAGNIFICENT
YOU SAW INDEED THE OUTLINE OF A FACE AND
FEATURES BUT THESE WERE SO CADAVEROUS AND SO STRANGELY PLACED YOU
COULD ALMOST HAVE FANCIED A HEAD SEVERED FROM ITS TRUNK AND FLUNG AT
RANDOM ON A PILE OF RICH MERCHANDISE
THE DISTANT LAMP RAYS GLANCED ON
CLEAR PENDANTS ON BROAD RINGS NEITHER THE CHASTENESS OF MOONLIGHT
NOR THE DISTANCE OF THE TORCHES COULD QUITE SUBDUE THE GORGEOUS DYES
OF THE DRAPERY
HAIL MADAME WALRAVENS I THINK YOU LOOKED MORE
WITCH LIKE THAN EVER
AND PRESENTLY THE GOOD LADY PROVED THAT SHE WAS
INDEED NO CORPSE OR GHOST BUT A HARSH AND HARDY OLD WOMAN FOR UPON
SOME AGGRAVATION IN THE CLAMOROUS PETITION OF DSIRE BECK TO HER
MOTHER TO GO TO THE KIOSK AND TAKE SWEETMEATS THE HUNCHBACK SUDDENLY
FETCHED HER A RESOUNDING RAP WITH HER GOLD KNOBBED CANE
THERE THEN WERE MADAME WALRAVENS MADAME BECK PRE SILAS THE WHOLE
CONJURATION THE SECRET JUNTA
THE SIGHT OF THEM THUS ASSEMBLED DID ME
GOOD
I CANNOT SAY THAT I FELT WEAK BEFORE THEM OR ABASHED OR
DISMAYED
THEY OUTNUMBERED ME AND I WAS WORSTED AND UNDER THEIR FEET
BUT AS YET I WAS NOT DEAD
CHAPTER XXXIX
OLD AND NEW ACQUAINTANCE
FASCINATED AS BY A BASILISK WITH THREE HEADS I COULD NOT LEAVE THIS
CLIQUE THE GROUND NEAR THEM SEEMED TO HOLD MY FEET
THE CANOPY OF
ENTWINED TREES HELD OUT SHADOW THE NIGHT WHISPERED A PLEDGE OF
PROTECTION AND AN OFFICIOUS LAMP FLASHED JUST ONE BEAM TO SHOW ME AN
OBSCURE SAFE SEAT AND THEN VANISHED
LET ME NOW BRIEFLY TELL THE
READER ALL THAT DURING THE PAST DARK FORTNIGHT I HAVE BEEN SILENTLY
GATHERING FROM RUMOUR RESPECTING THE ORIGIN AND THE OBJECT OF M
EMANUEL'S DEPARTURE
THE TALE IS SHORT AND NOT NEW ITS ALPHA IS
MAMMON AND ITS OMEGA INTEREST
IF MADAME WALRAVENS WAS HIDEOUS AS A HINDOO IDOL SHE SEEMED ALSO TO
POSSESS IN THE ESTIMATION OF THESE HER VOTARIES AN IDOL'S
CONSEQUENCE
THE FACT WAS SHE HAD BEEN RICH VERY RICH AND THOUGH
FOR THE PRESENT WITHOUT THE COMMAND OF MONEY SHE WAS LIKELY ONE DAY
TO BE RICH AGAIN
AT BASSETERRE IN GUADALOUPE SHE POSSESSED A LARGE
ESTATE RECEIVED IN DOWRY ON HER MARRIAGE SIXTY YEARS AGO SEQUESTERED
SINCE HER HUSBAND'S FAILURE BUT NOW IT WAS SUPPOSED CLEARED OF
CLAIM AND IF DULY LOOKED AFTER BY A COMPETENT AGENT OF INTEGRITY
CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF BEING MADE IN A FEW YEARS LARGELY PRODUCTIVE
PRE SILAS TOOK AN INTEREST IN THIS PROSPECTIVE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE
SAKE OF RELIGION AND THE CHURCH WHEREOF MAGLIORE WALRAVENS WAS A
DEVOUT DAUGHTER
MADAME BECK DISTANTLY RELATED TO THE HUNCHBACK AND
KNOWING HER TO BE WITHOUT FAMILY OF HER OWN HAD LONG BROODED OVER
CONTINGENCIES WITH A MOTHER'S CALCULATING FORETHOUGHT AND HARSHLY
TREATED AS SHE WAS BY MADAME WALRAVENS NEVER CEASED TO COURT HER FOR
INTEREST'S SAKE
MADAME BECK AND THE PRIEST WERE THUS FOR MONEY
REASONS EQUALLY AND SINCERELY INTERESTED IN THE NURSING OF THE WEST
INDIAN ESTATE
BUT THE DISTANCE WAS GREAT AND THE CLIMATE HAZARDOUS
THE COMPETENT
AND UPRIGHT AGENT WANTED MUST BE A DEVOTED MAN
JUST SUCH A MAN HAD
MADAME WALRAVENS RETAINED FOR TWENTY YEARS IN HER SERVICE BLIGHTING
HIS LIFE AND THEN LIVING ON HIM LIKE AN OLD FUNGUS SUCH A MAN HAD
PRE SILAS TRAINED TAUGHT AND BOUND TO HIM BY THE TIES OF GRATITUDE
HABIT AND BELIEF
SUCH A MAN MADAME BECK KNEW AND COULD IN SOME
MEASURE INFLUENCE
MY PUPIL SAID PRE SILAS IF HE REMAINS IN
EUROPE RUNS RISK OF APOSTACY FOR HE HAS BECOME ENTANGLED WITH A
HERETIC MADAME BECK MADE ALSO HER PRIVATE COMMENT AND PREFERRED IN
HER OWN BREAST HER SECRET REASON FOR DESIRING EXPATRIATION
THE THING
SHE COULD NOT OBTAIN SHE DESIRED NOT ANOTHER TO WIN RATHER WOULD SHE
DESTROY IT
AS TO MADAME WALRAVENS SHE WANTED HER MONEY AND HER LAND
AND KNEW PAUL IF HE LIKED COULD MAKE THE BEST AND FAITHFULLEST
STEWARD SO THE THREE SELF SEEKERS BANDED AND BESET THE ONE UNSELFISH
THEY REASONED THEY APPEALED THEY IMPLORED ON HIS MERCY THEY CAST
THEMSELVES INTO HIS HANDS THEY CONFIDINGLY THRUST THEIR INTERESTS
THEY ASKED BUT TWO OR THREE YEARS OF DEVOTION AFTER THAT HE SHOULD
LIVE FOR HIMSELF ONE OF THE NUMBER PERHAPS WISHED THAT IN THE
MEANTIME HE MIGHT DIE
NO LIVING BEING EVER HUMBLY LAID HIS ADVANTAGE AT M
EMANUEL'S FEET OR
CONFIDINGLY PUT IT INTO HIS HANDS THAT HE SPURNED THE TRUST OR
REPULSED THE REPOSITORY
WHAT MIGHT BE HIS PRIVATE PAIN OR INWARD
RELUCTANCE TO LEAVE EUROPE WHAT HIS CALCULATIONS FOR HIS OWN
FUTURE NONE ASKED OR KNEW OR REPORTED
ALL THIS WAS A BLANK TO ME
HIS CONFERENCES WITH HIS CONFESSOR I MIGHT GUESS THE PART DUTY AND
RELIGION WERE MADE TO PLAY IN THE PERSUASIONS USED I MIGHT CONJECTURE
HE WAS GONE AND HAD MADE NO SIGN
THERE MY KNOWLEDGE CLOSED
WITH MY HEAD BENT AND MY FOREHEAD RESTING ON MY HANDS I SAT AMIDST
GROUPED TREE STEMS AND BRANCHING BRUSHWOOD
WHATEVER TALK PASSED
AMONGST MY NEIGHBOURS I MIGHT HEAR IF I WOULD I WAS NEAR ENOUGH BUT
FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS SCARCE MOTIVE TO ATTEND
THEY GOSSIPED ABOUT
THE DRESSES THE MUSIC THE ILLUMINATIONS THE FINE NIGHT
I LISTENED
TO HEAR THEM SAY IT IS CALM WEATHER FOR HIS VOYAGE THE ANTIGUA
HIS SHIP WILL SAIL PROSPEROUSLY NO SUCH REMARK FELL NEITHER THE
ANTIGUA NOR HER COURSE NOR HER PASSENGER WERE NAMED
PERHAPS THE LIGHT CHAT SCARCELY INTERESTED OLD MADAME WALRAVENS MORE
THAN IT DID ME SHE APPEARED RESTLESS TURNING HER HEAD NOW TO THIS
SIDE NOW THAT LOOKING THROUGH THE TREES AND AMONG THE CROWD AS IF
EXPECTANT OF AN ARRIVAL AND IMPATIENT OF DELAY
O SONT ILS POURQUOI
NE VIENNENT ILS I HEARD HER MUTTER MORE THAN ONCE AND AT LAST AS IF
DETERMINED TO HAVE AN ANSWER TO HER QUESTION WHICH HITHERTO NONE
SEEMED TO MIND SHE SPOKE ALOUD THIS PHRASE A PHRASE BRIEF ENOUGH
SIMPLE ENOUGH BUT IT SENT A SHOCK THROUGH ME MESSIEURS ET MESDAMES
SAID SHE O DONC EST JUSTINE MARIE
JUSTINE MARIE WHAT WAS THIS JUSTINE MARIE THE DEAD NUN WHERE WAS
SHE WHY IN HER GRAVE MADAME WALRAVENS WHAT CAN YOU WANT WITH HER
YOU SHALL GO TO HER BUT SHE SHALL NOT COME TO YOU
THUS I SHOULD HAVE ANSWERED HAD THE RESPONSE LAIN WITH ME BUT
NOBODY SEEMED TO BE OF MY MIND NOBODY SEEMED SURPRISED STARTLED OR
AT A LOSS
THE QUIETEST COMMONPLACE ANSWER MET THE STRANGE THE
DEAD DISTURBING THE WITCH OF ENDOR QUERY OF THE HUNCHBACK
JUSTINE MARIE SAID ONE IS COMING SHE IS IN THE KIOSK SHE WILL BE
HERE PRESENTLY
OUT OF THIS QUESTION AND REPLY SPRANG A CHANGE IN THE CHAT CHAT IT
STILL REMAINED EASY DESULTORY FAMILIAR GOSSIP
HINT ALLUSION
COMMENT WENT ROUND THE CIRCLE BUT ALL SO BROKEN SO DEPENDENT ON
REFERENCES TO PERSONS NOT NAMED OR CIRCUMSTANCES NOT DEFINED THAT
LISTEN AS INTENTLY AS I WOULD AND I DID LISTEN NOW WITH A FATED
INTEREST I COULD MAKE OUT NO MORE THAN THAT SOME SCHEME WAS ON FOOT
IN WHICH THIS GHOSTLY JUSTINE MARIE DEAD OR ALIVE WAS CONCERNED
THIS
FAMILY JUNTA SEEMED GRASPING AT HER SOMEHOW FOR SOME REASON THERE
SEEMED QUESTION OF A MARRIAGE OF A FORTUNE FOR WHOM I COULD NOT QUITE
MAKE OUT PERHAPS FOR VICTOR KINT PERHAPS FOR JOSEF EMANUEL BOTH WERE
BACHELORS
ONCE I THOUGHT THE HINTS AND JESTS RAINED UPON A YOUNG
FAIR HAIRED FOREIGNER OF THE PARTY WHOM THEY CALLED HEINRICH MHLER
AMIDST ALL THE BADINAGE MADAME WALRAVENS STILL OBTRUDED FROM TIME TO
TIME HOARSE CROSS GRAINED SPEECHES HER IMPATIENCE BEING DIVERTED
ONLY BY AN IMPLACABLE SURVEILLANCE OF DSIRE WHO COULD NOT STIR BUT
THE OLD WOMAN MENACED HER WITH HER STAFF
LA VOIL SUDDENLY CRIED ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN VOIL JUSTINE MARIE
QUI ARRIVE
THIS MOMENT WAS FOR ME PECULIAR
I CALLED UP TO MEMORY THE PICTURED NUN
ON THE PANEL PRESENT TO MY MIND WAS THE SAD LOVE STORY I SAW IN
THOUGHT THE VISION OF THE GARRET THE APPARITION OF THE ALLEY THE
STRANGE BIRTH OF THE BERCEAU I UNDERWENT A PRESENTIMENT OF DISCOVERY
A STRONG CONVICTION OF COMING DISCLOSURE
AH WHEN IMAGINATION ONCE
RUNS RIOT WHERE DO WE STOP WHAT WINTER TREE SO BARE AND
BRANCHLESS WHAT WAY SIDE HEDGE MUNCHING ANIMAL SO HUMBLE THAT FANCY
A PASSING CLOUD AND A STRUGGLING MOONBEAM WILL NOT CLOTHE IT IN
SPIRITUALITY AND MAKE OF IT A PHANTOM
WITH SOLEMN FORCE PRESSED ON MY HEART THE EXPECTATION OF MYSTERY
BREAKING UP HITHERTO I HAD SEEN THIS SPECTRE ONLY THROUGH A GLASS
DARKLY NOW WAS I TO BEHOLD IT FACE TO FACE
I LEANED FORWARD I LOOKED
SHE COMES CRIED JOSEF EMANUEL
THE CIRCLE OPENED AS IF OPENING TO ADMIT A NEW AND WELCOME MEMBER
AT
THIS INSTANT A TORCH CHANCED TO BE CARRIED PAST ITS BLAZE AIDED THE
PALE MOON IN DOING JUSTICE TO THE CRISIS IN LIGHTING TO PERFECTION THE
DNOUEMENT PRESSING ON
SURELY THOSE NEAR ME MUST HAVE FELT SOME LITTLE
OF THE ANXIETY I FELT IN DEGREE SO UNMETED
OF THAT GROUP THE COOLEST
MUST HAVE HELD HIS BREATH FOR A TIME AS FOR ME MY LIFE STOOD STILL
IT IS OVER
THE MOMENT AND THE NUN ARE COME
THE CRISIS AND THE
REVELATION ARE PASSED BY
THE FLAMBEAU GLARES STILL WITHIN A YARD HELD UP IN A PARK KEEPER'S
HAND ITS LONG EAGER TONGUE OF FLAME ALMOST LICKS THE FIGURE OF THE
EXPECTED THERE WHERE SHE STANDS FULL IN MY SIGHT
WHAT IS SHE LIKE
WHAT DOES SHE WEAR HOW DOES SHE LOOK WHO IS SHE
THERE ARE MANY MASKS IN THE PARK TO NIGHT AND AS THE HOUR WEARS LATE
SO STRANGE A FEELING OF REVELRY AND MYSTERY BEGINS TO SPREAD ABROAD
THAT SCARCE WOULD YOU DISCREDIT ME READER WERE I TO SAY THAT SHE IS
LIKE THE NUN OF THE ATTIC THAT SHE WEARS BLACK SKIRTS AND WHITE
HEAD CLOTHES THAT SHE LOOKS THE RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH AND THAT
SHE IS A RISEN GHOST
ALL FALSITIES ALL FIGMENTS WE WILL NOT DEAL IN THIS GEAR
LET US BE
HONEST AND CUT AS HERETOFORE FROM THE HOMELY WEB OF TRUTH
HOMELY THOUGH IS AN ILL CHOSEN WORD
WHAT I SEE IS NOT PRECISELY
HOMELY
A GIRL OF VILLETTE STANDS THERE A GIRL FRESH FROM HER
PENSIONNAT
SHE IS VERY COMELY WITH THE BEAUTY INDIGENOUS TO THIS
COUNTRY
SHE LOOKS WELL NOURISHED FAIR AND FAT OF FLESH
HER CHEEKS
ARE ROUND HER EYES GOOD HER HAIR IS ABUNDANT
SHE IS HANDSOMELY
DRESSED
SHE IS NOT ALONE HER ESCORT CONSISTS OF THREE PERSONS TWO
BEING ELDERLY THESE SHE ADDRESSES AS MON ONCLE AND MA TANTE SHE
LAUGHS SHE CHATS GOOD HUMOURED BUXOM AND BLOOMING SHE LOOKS AT
ALL POINTS THE BOURGEOISE BELLE
SO MUCH FOR JUSTINE MARIE SO MUCH FOR GHOSTS AND MYSTERY NOT THAT
THIS LAST WAS SOLVED THIS GIRL CERTAINLY IS NOT MY NUN WHAT I SAW IN
THE GARRET AND GARDEN MUST HAVE BEEN TALLER BY A SPAN
WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE CITY BELLE WE HAVE CURSORILY GLANCED AT THE
RESPECTABLE OLD UNCLE AND AUNT
HAVE WE A STRAY GLANCE TO GIVE TO THE
THIRD MEMBER OF THIS COMPANY CAN WE SPARE HIM A MOMENT'S NOTICE WE
OUGHT TO DISTINGUISH HIM SO FAR READER HE HAS CLAIMS ON US WE DO NOT
NOW MEET HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME
I CLASPED MY HANDS VERY HARD AND I
DREW MY BREATH VERY DEEP I HELD IN THE CRY I DEVOURED THE
EJACULATION I FORBADE THE START I SPOKE AND I STIRRED NO MORE THAN A
STONE BUT I KNEW WHAT I LOOKED ON THROUGH THE DIMNESS LEFT IN MY EYES
BY MANY NIGHTS' WEEPING I KNEW HIM
THEY SAID HE WAS TO SAIL BY THE
ANTIGUA
MADAME BECK SAID SO
SHE LIED OR SHE HAD UTTERED WHAT WAS
ONCE TRUTH AND FAILED TO CONTRADICT IT WHEN IT BECAME FALSE
THE
ANTIGUA WAS GONE AND THERE STOOD PAUL EMANUEL
WAS I GLAD A HUGE LOAD LEFT ME
WAS IT A FACT TO WARRANT JOY I KNOW
NOT
ASK FIRST WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDANT ON THIS RESPITE
HOW FAR DID THIS DELAY CONCERN ME WERE THERE NOT THOSE WHOM IT MIGHT
TOUCH MORE NEARLY
AFTER ALL WHO MAY THIS YOUNG GIRL THIS JUSTINE MARIE BE NOT A
STRANGER READER SHE IS KNOWN TO ME BY SIGHT SHE VISITS AT THE RUE
FOSSETTE SHE IS OFTEN OF MADAME BECK'S SUNDAY PARTIES
SHE IS A
RELATION OF BOTH THE BECKS AND WALRAVENS SHE DERIVES HER BAPTISMAL
NAME FROM THE SAINTED NUN WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN HER AUNT HAD SHE LIVED
HER PATRONYMIC IS SAUVEUR SHE IS AN HEIRESS AND AN ORPHAN AND M
EMANUEL IS HER GUARDIAN SOME SAY HER GODFATHER
THE FAMILY JUNTA WISH THIS HEIRESS TO BE MARRIED TO ONE OF THEIR
BAND WHICH IS IT VITAL QUESTION WHICH IS IT
I FELT VERY GLAD NOW THAT THE DRUG ADMINISTERED IN THE SWEET DRAUGHT
HAD FILLED ME WITH A POSSESSION WHICH MADE BED AND CHAMBER INTOLERABLE
I ALWAYS THROUGH MY WHOLE LIFE LIKED TO PENETRATE TO THE REAL TRUTH
I LIKE SEEKING THE GODDESS IN HER TEMPLE AND HANDLING THE VEIL AND
DARING THE DREAD GLANCE
O TITANESS AMONG DEITIES THE COVERED OUTLINE
OF THINE ASPECT SICKENS OFTEN THROUGH ITS UNCERTAINTY BUT DEFINE TO US
ONE TRAIT SHOW US ONE LINEAMENT CLEAR IN AWFUL SINCERITY WE MAY GASP
IN UNTOLD TERROR BUT WITH THAT GASP WE DRINK IN A BREATH OF THY
DIVINITY OUR HEART SHAKES AND ITS CURRENTS SWAY LIKE RIVERS LIFTED BY
EARTHQUAKE BUT WE HAVE SWALLOWED STRENGTH
TO SEE AND KNOW THE WORST
IS TO TAKE FROM FEAR HER MAIN ADVANTAGE
THE WALRAVENS' PARTY AUGMENTED IN NUMBERS NOW BECAME VERY GAY
THE
GENTLEMEN FETCHED REFRESHMENTS FROM THE KIOSK ALL SAT DOWN ON THE TURF
UNDER THE TREES THEY DRANK HEALTHS AND SENTIMENTS THEY LAUGHED THEY
JESTED
M
EMANUEL UNDERWENT SOME RAILLERY HALF GOOD HUMOURED HALF I
THOUGHT MALICIOUS ESPECIALLY ON MADAME BECK'S PART
I SOON GATHERED
THAT HIS VOYAGE HAD BEEN TEMPORARILY DEFERRED OF HIS OWN WILL WITHOUT
THE CONCURRENCE EVEN AGAINST THE ADVICE OF HIS FRIENDS HE HAD LET
THE ANTIGUA GO AND HAD TAKEN HIS BERTH IN THE PAUL ET VIRGINIE
APPOINTED TO SAIL A FORTNIGHT LATER
IT WAS HIS REASON FOR THIS RESOLVE
WHICH THEY TEASED HIM TO ASSIGN AND WHICH HE WOULD ONLY VAGUELY
INDICATE AS THE SETTLEMENT OF A LITTLE PIECE OF BUSINESS WHICH HE HAD
SET HIS HEART UPON WHAT WAS THIS BUSINESS NOBODY KNEW
YES THERE
WAS ONE WHO SEEMED PARTLY AT LEAST IN HIS CONFIDENCE A MEANING LOOK
PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND JUSTINE MARIE
LA PETITE VA M'AIDER N'EST CE
PAS SAID HE
THE ANSWER WAS PROMPT ENOUGH GOD KNOWS
MAIS OUI JE VOUS AIDERAI DE TOUT MON COEUR
VOUS FEREZ DE MOI TOUT CE
QUE VOUS VOUDREZ MON PARRAIN
AND THIS DEAR PARRAIN TOOK HER HAND AND LIFTED IT TO HIS GRATEFUL
LIPS
UPON WHICH DEMONSTRATION I SAW THE LIGHT COMPLEXIONED YOUNG
TEUTON HEINRICH MHLER GROW RESTLESS AS IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT
HE
EVEN GRUMBLED A FEW WORDS WHEREAT M
EMANUEL ACTUALLY LAUGHED IN HIS
FACE AND WITH THE RUTHLESS TRIUMPH OF THE ASSURED CONQUEROR HE DREW
HIS WARD NEARER TO HIM
M
EMANUEL WAS INDEED VERY JOYOUS THAT NIGHT
HE SEEMED NOT ONE WHIT
SUBDUED BY THE CHANGE OF SCENE AND ACTION IMPENDING
HE WAS THE TRUE
LIFE OF THE PARTY A LITTLE DESPOTIC PERHAPS DETERMINED TO BE CHIEF
IN MIRTH AS WELL AS IN LABOUR YET FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT PROVING
INDISPUTABLY HIS RIGHT OF LEADERSHIP
HIS WAS THE WITTIEST WORD THE
PLEASANTEST ANECDOTE THE FRANKEST LAUGH
RESTLESSLY ACTIVE AFTER HIS
MANNER HE MULTIPLIED HIMSELF TO WAIT ON ALL BUT OH I SAW WHICH WAS
HIS FAVOURITE
I SAW AT WHOSE FEET HE LAY ON THE TURF I SAW WHOM HE
FOLDED CAREFULLY FROM THE NIGHT AIR WHOM HE TENDED WATCHED AND
CHERISHED AS THE APPLE OF HIS EYE
STILL HINT AND RAILLERY FLEW THICK AND STILL I GATHERED THAT WHILE M
PAUL SHOULD BE ABSENT WORKING FOR OTHERS THESE OTHERS NOT QUITE
UNGRATEFUL WOULD GUARD FOR HIM THE TREASURE HE LEFT IN EUROPE
LET HIM
BRING THEM AN INDIAN FORTUNE THEY WOULD GIVE HIM IN RETURN A YOUNG
BRIDE AND A RICH INHERITANCE
AS FOR THE SAINTLY CONSECRATION THE VOW
OF CONSTANCY THAT WAS FORGOTTEN THE BLOOMING AND CHARMING PRESENT
PREVAILED OVER THE PAST AND AT LENGTH HIS NUN WAS INDEED BURIED
THUS IT MUST BE
THE REVELATION WAS INDEED COME
PRESENTIMENT HAD NOT
BEEN MISTAKEN IN HER IMPULSE THERE IS A KIND OF PRESENTIMENT WHICH
NEVER IS MISTAKEN IT WAS I WHO HAD FOR A MOMENT MISCALCULATED NOT
SEEING THE TRUE BEARING OF THE ORACLE I HAD THOUGHT SHE MUTTERED OF
VISION WHEN IN TRUTH HER PREDICTION TOUCHED REALITY
I MIGHT HAVE PAUSED LONGER UPON WHAT I SAW I MIGHT HAVE DELIBERATED
ERE I DREW INFERENCES
SOME PERHAPS WOULD HAVE HELD THE PREMISES
DOUBTFUL THE PROOFS INSUFFICIENT SOME SLOW SCEPTICS WOULD HAVE
INCREDULOUSLY EXAMINED ERE THEY CONCLUSIVELY ACCEPTED THE PROJECT OF A
MARRIAGE BETWEEN A POOR AND UNSELFISH MAN OF FORTY AND HIS WEALTHY
WARD OF EIGHTEEN BUT FAR FROM ME SUCH SHIFTS AND PALLIATIVES FAR FROM
ME SUCH TEMPORARY EVASION OF THE ACTUAL SUCH COWARD FLEEING FROM THE
DREAD THE SWIFT FOOTED THE ALL OVERTAKING FACT SUCH FEEBLE SUSPENSE
OF SUBMISSION TO HER THE SOLE SOVEREIGN SUCH PALTERING AND FALTERING
RESISTANCE TO THE POWER WHOSE ERRAND IS TO MARCH CONQUERING AND TO
CONQUER SUCH TRAITOR DEFECTION FROM THE TRUTH
NO
I HASTENED TO ACCEPT THE WHOLE PLAN
I EXTENDED MY GRASP AND TOOK
IT ALL IN
I GATHERED IT TO ME WITH A SORT OF RAGE OF HASTE AND FOLDED
IT ROUND ME AS THE SOLDIER STRUCK ON THE FIELD FOLDS HIS COLOURS ABOUT
HIS BREAST
I INVOKED CONVICTION TO NAIL UPON ME THE CERTAINTY
ABHORRED WHILE EMBRACED TO FIX IT WITH THE STRONGEST SPIKES HER
STRONGEST STROKES COULD DRIVE AND WHEN THE IRON HAD ENTERED WELL MY
SOUL I STOOD UP AS I THOUGHT RENOVATED
IN MY INFATUATION I SAID TRUTH YOU ARE A GOOD MISTRESS TO YOUR
FAITHFUL SERVANTS WHILE A LIE PRESSED ME HOW I SUFFERED EVEN WHEN
THE FALSEHOOD WAS STILL SWEET STILL FLATTERING TO THE FANCY AND WARM
TO THE FEELINGS IT WASTED ME WITH HOURLY TORMENT
THE PERSUASION THAT
AFFECTION WAS WON COULD NOT BE DIVORCED FROM THE DREAD THAT BY ANOTHER
TURN OF THE WHEEL IT MIGHT BE LOST
TRUTH STRIPPED AWAY FALSEHOOD AND
FLATTERY AND EXPECTANCY AND HERE I STAND FREE
NOTHING REMAINED NOW BUT TO TAKE MY FREEDOM TO MY CHAMBER TO CARRY IT
WITH ME TO MY BED AND SEE WHAT I COULD MAKE OF IT
THE PLAY WAS NOT
YET INDEED QUITE PLAYED OUT
I MIGHT HAVE WAITED AND WATCHED LONGER
THAT LOVE SCENE UNDER THE TREES THAT SYLVAN COURTSHIP
HAD THERE BEEN
NOTHING OF LOVE IN THE DEMONSTRATION MY FANCY IN THIS HOUR WAS SO
GENEROUS SO CREATIVE SHE COULD HAVE MODELLED FOR IT THE MOST SALIENT
LINEAMENTS AND GIVEN IT THE DEEPEST LIFE AND HIGHEST COLOUR OF
PASSION
BUT I WOULD NOT LOOK I HAD FIXED MY RESOLVE BUT I WOULD
NOT VIOLATE MY NATURE
AND THEN SOMETHING TORE ME SO CRUELLY UNDER MY
SHAWL SOMETHING SO DUG INTO MY SIDE A VULTURE SO STRONG IN BEAK AND
TALON I MUST BE ALONE TO GRAPPLE WITH IT
I THINK I NEVER FELT
JEALOUSY TILL NOW
THIS WAS NOT LIKE ENDURING THE ENDEARMENTS OF DR
JOHN AND PAULINA AGAINST WHICH WHILE I SEALED MY EYES AND MY EARS
WHILE I WITHDREW THENCE MY THOUGHTS MY SENSE OF HARMONY STILL
ACKNOWLEDGED IN IT A CHARM
THIS WAS AN OUTRAGE
THE LOVE BORN OF
BEAUTY WAS NOT MINE I HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH IT I COULD NOT DARE
TO MEDDLE WITH IT BUT ANOTHER LOVE VENTURING DIFFIDENTLY INTO LIFE
AFTER LONG ACQUAINTANCE FURNACE TRIED BY PAIN STAMPED BY CONSTANCY
CONSOLIDATED BY AFFECTION'S PURE AND DURABLE ALLOY SUBMITTED BY
INTELLECT TO INTELLECT'S OWN TESTS AND FINALLY WROUGHT UP BY HIS OWN
PROCESS TO HIS OWN UNFLAWED COMPLETENESS THIS LOVE THAT LAUGHED AT
PASSION HIS FAST FRENZIES AND HIS HOT AND HURRIED EXTINCTION IN
THIS LOVE I HAD A VESTED INTEREST AND WHATEVER TENDED EITHER TO ITS
CULTURE OR ITS DESTRUCTION I COULD NOT VIEW IMPASSIBLY
I TURNED FROM THE GROUP OF TREES AND THE MERRIE COMPANIE IN ITS
SHADE
MIDNIGHT WAS LONG PAST THE CONCERT WAS OVER THE CROWDS WERE
THINNING
I FOLLOWED THE EBB
LEAVING THE RADIANT PARK AND WELL LIT
HAUTE VILLE STILL WELL LIT THIS IT SEEMS WAS TO BE A NUIT BLANCHE
IN VILLETTE I SOUGHT THE DIM LOWER QUARTER
DIM I SHOULD NOT SAY FOR THE BEAUTY OF MOONLIGHT FORGOTTEN IN THE
PARK HERE ONCE MORE FLOWED IN UPON PERCEPTION
HIGH SHE RODE AND CALM
AND STAINLESSLY SHE SHONE
THE MUSIC AND THE MIRTH OF THE FTE THE
FIRE AND BRIGHT HUES OF THOSE LAMPS HAD OUT DONE AND OUT SHONE HER FOR
AN HOUR BUT NOW AGAIN HER GLORY AND HER SILENCE TRIUMPHED
THE RIVAL
LAMPS WERE DYING SHE HELD HER COURSE LIKE A WHITE FATE
DRUM TRUMPET
BUGLE HAD UTTERED THEIR CLANGOUR AND WERE FORGOTTEN WITH PENCIL RAY
SHE WROTE ON HEAVEN AND ON EARTH RECORDS FOR ARCHIVES EVERLASTING
SHE
AND THOSE STARS SEEMED TO ME AT ONCE THE TYPES AND WITNESSES OF TRUTH
ALL REGNANT
THE NIGHT SKY LIT HER REIGN LIKE ITS SLOW WHEELING
PROGRESS ADVANCED HER VICTORY THAT ONWARD MOVEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN
AND IS AND WILL BE FROM ETERNITY TO ETERNITY
THESE OIL TWINKLING STREETS ARE VERY STILL I LIKE THEM FOR THEIR
LOWLINESS AND PEACE
HOMEWARD BOUND BURGHERS PASS ME NOW AND THEN BUT
THESE COMPANIES ARE PEDESTRIANS MAKE LITTLE NOISE AND ARE SOON GONE
SO WELL DO I LOVE VILLETTE UNDER HER PRESENT ASPECT NOT WILLINGLY
WOULD I RE ENTER UNDER A ROOF BUT THAT I AM BENT ON PURSUING MY
STRANGE ADVENTURE TO A SUCCESSFUL CLOSE AND QUIETLY REGAINING MY BED
IN THE GREAT DORMITORY BEFORE MADAME BECK COMES HOME
ONLY ONE STREET LIES BETWEEN ME AND THE RUE FOSSETTE AS I ENTER IT
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE SOUND OF A CARRIAGE TEARS UP THE DEEP PEACE OF
THIS QUARTER
IT COMES THIS WAY COMES VERY FAST
HOW LOUD SOUNDS ITS
RATTLE ON THE PAVED PATH THE STREET IS NARROW AND I KEEP CAREFULLY TO
THE CAUSEWAY
THE CARRIAGE THUNDERS PAST BUT WHAT DO I SEE OR FANCY I
SEE AS IT RUSHES BY SURELY SOMETHING WHITE FLUTTERED FROM THAT
WINDOW SURELY A HAND WAVED A HANDKERCHIEF
WAS THAT SIGNAL MEANT FOR
ME AM I KNOWN WHO COULD RECOGNISE ME THAT IS NOT M
DE
BASSOMPIERRE'S CARRIAGE NOR MRS
BRETTON'S AND BESIDES NEITHER THE
HTEL CRCY NOR THE CHTEAU OF LA TERRASSE LIES IN THAT DIRECTION
WELL I HAVE NO TIME FOR CONJECTURE I MUST HURRY HOME
GAINING THE RUE FOSSETTE REACHING THE PENSIONNAT ALL THERE WAS STILL
NO FIACRE HAD YET ARRIVED WITH MADAME AND DSIRE
I HAD LEFT THE GREAT
DOOR AJAR SHOULD I FIND IT THUS PERHAPS THE WIND OR SOME OTHER
ACCIDENT MAY HAVE THROWN IT TO WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO START THE
SPRING BOLT IN THAT CASE HOPELESS BECAME ADMISSION MY ADVENTURE MUST
ISSUE IN CATASTROPHE
I LIGHTLY PUSHED THE HEAVY LEAF WOULD IT YIELD
YES
AS SOUNDLESS AS UNRESISTING AS IF SOME PROPITIOUS GENIUS HAD
WAITED ON A SESAME CHARM IN THE VESTIBULE WITHIN
ENTERING WITH BATED
BREATH QUIETLY MAKING ALL FAST SHOELESSLY MOUNTING THE STAIRCASE I
SOUGHT THE DORMITORY AND REACHED MY COUCH
AY I REACHED IT AND ONCE MORE DREW A FREE INSPIRATION
THE NEXT
MOMENT I ALMOST SHRIEKED ALMOST BUT NOT QUITE THANK HEAVEN
THROUGHOUT THE DORMITORY THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE THERE REIGNED AT THIS
HOUR THE STILLNESS OF DEATH
ALL SLEPT AND IN SUCH HUSH IT SEEMED
THAT NONE DREAMED
STRETCHED ON THE NINETEEN BEDS LAY NINETEEN FORMS
AT FULL LENGTH AND MOTIONLESS
ON MINE THE TWENTIETH COUCH NOTHING
OUGHT TO HAVE LAIN I HAD LEFT IT VOID AND VOID SHOULD HAVE FOUND
IT
WHAT THEN DO I SEE BETWEEN THE HALF DRAWN CURTAINS WHAT DARK
USURPING SHAPE SUPINE LONG AND STRANGE IS IT A ROBBER WHO HAS MADE
HIS WAY THROUGH THE OPEN STREET DOOR AND LIES THERE IN WAIT IT LOOKS
VERY BLACK I THINK IT LOOKS NOT HUMAN
CAN IT BE A WANDERING DOG THAT
HAS COME IN FROM THE STREET AND CREPT AND NESTLED HITHER WILL IT
SPRING WILL IT LEAP OUT IF I APPROACH APPROACH I MUST
COURAGE ONE
STEP
MY HEAD REELED FOR BY THE FAINT NIGHT LAMP I SAW STRETCHED ON MY BED
THE OLD PHANTOM THE NUN
A CRY AT THIS MOMENT MIGHT HAVE RUINED ME
BE THE SPECTACLE WHAT IT
MIGHT I COULD AFFORD NEITHER CONSTERNATION SCREAM NOR SWOON
BESIDES I WAS NOT OVERCOME
TEMPERED BY LATE INCIDENTS MY NERVES
DISDAINED HYSTERIA
WARM FROM ILLUMINATIONS AND MUSIC AND THRONGING
THOUSANDS THOROUGHLY LASHED UP BY A NEW SCOURGE I DEFIED SPECTRA
IN
A MOMENT WITHOUT EXCLAMATION I HAD RUSHED ON THE HAUNTED COUCH
NOTHING LEAPED OUT OR SPRUNG OR STIRRED ALL THE MOVEMENT WAS MINE
SO WAS ALL THE LIFE THE REALITY THE SUBSTANCE THE FORCE AS MY
INSTINCT FELT
I TORE HER UP THE INCUBUS I HELD HER ON HIGH THE
GOBLIN I SHOOK HER LOOSE THE MYSTERY AND DOWN SHE FELL DOWN ALL
AROUND ME DOWN IN SHREDS AND FRAGMENTS AND I TRODE UPON HER
HERE AGAIN BEHOLD THE BRANCHLESS TREE THE UNSTABLED ROSINANTE THE
FILM OF CLOUD THE FLICKER OF MOONSHINE
THE LONG NUN PROVED A LONG
BOLSTER DRESSED IN A LONG BLACK STOLE AND ARTFULLY INVESTED WITH A
WHITE VEIL
THE GARMENTS IN VERY TRUTH STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM WERE
GENUINE NUN'S GARMENTS AND BY SOME HAND THEY HAD BEEN DISPOSED WITH A
VIEW TO ILLUSION
WHENCE CAME THESE VESTMENTS WHO CONTRIVED THIS
ARTIFICE THESE QUESTIONS STILL REMAINED
TO THE HEAD BANDAGE WAS
PINNED A SLIP OF PAPER IT BORE IN PENCIL THESE MOCKING WORDS
THE NUN OF THE ATTIC BEQUEATHS TO LUCY SNOWE HER WARDROBE
SHE WILL BE
SEEN IN THE RUE FOSSETTE NO MORE
AND WHAT AND WHO WAS SHE THAT HAD HAUNTED ME SHE I HAD ACTUALLY SEEN
THREE TIMES
NOT A WOMAN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE HAD THE STATURE OF THAT
GHOST
SHE WAS NOT OF A FEMALE HEIGHT
NOT TO ANY MAN I KNEW COULD THE
MACHINATION FOR A MOMENT BE ATTRIBUTED
STILL MYSTIFIED BEYOND EXPRESSION BUT AS THOROUGHLY AS SUDDENLY
RELIEVED FROM ALL SENSE OF THE SPECTRAL AND UNEARTHLY SCORNING ALSO TO
WEAR OUT MY BRAIN WITH THE FRET OF A TRIVIAL THOUGH INSOLUBLE RIDDLE I
JUST BUNDLED TOGETHER STOLE VEIL AND BANDAGES THRUST THEM BENEATH MY
PILLOW LAY DOWN LISTENED TILL I HEARD THE WHEELS OF MADAME'S
HOME RETURNING FIACRE THEN TURNED AND WORN OUT BY MANY NIGHTS'
VIGILS CONQUERED TOO PERHAPS BY THE NOW REACTING NARCOTIC I DEEPLY
SLEPT
CHAPTER XL
THE HAPPY PAIR
THE DAY SUCCEEDING THIS REMARKABLE MIDSUMMER NIGHT PROVED NO COMMON
DAY
I DO NOT MEAN THAT IT BROUGHT SIGNS IN HEAVEN ABOVE OR PORTENTS
ON THE EARTH BENEATH NOR DO I ALLUDE TO METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA TO
STORM FLOOD OR WHIRLWIND
ON THE CONTRARY THE SUN ROSE JOCUND WITH
A JULY FACE
MORNING DECKED HER BEAUTY WITH RUBIES AND SO FILLED HER
LAP WITH ROSES THAT THEY FELL FROM HER IN SHOWERS MAKING HER PATH
BLUSH THE HOURS WOKE FRESH AS NYMPHS AND EMPTYING ON THE EARLY HILLS
THEIR DEW VIALS THEY STEPPED OUT DISMANTLED OF VAPOUR SHADOWLESS
AZURE AND GLORIOUS THEY LED THE SUN'S STEEDS ON A BURNING AND
UNCLOUDED COURSE
IN SHORT IT WAS AS FINE A DAY AS THE FINEST SUMMER COULD BOAST BUT I
DOUBT WHETHER I WAS NOT THE SOLE INHABITANT OF THE RUE FOSSETTE WHO
CARED OR REMEMBERED TO NOTE THIS PLEASANT FACT
ANOTHER THOUGHT BUSIED
ALL OTHER HEADS A THOUGHT INDEED WHICH HAD ITS SHARE IN MY
MEDITATIONS BUT THIS MASTER CONSIDERATION NOT POSSESSING FOR ME SO
ENTIRE A NOVELTY SO OVERWHELMING A SUDDENNESS ESPECIALLY SO DENSE A
MYSTERY AS IT OFFERED TO THE MAJORITY OF MY CO SPECULATORS THEREON
LEFT ME SOMEWHAT MORE OPEN THAN THE REST TO ANY COLLATERAL OBSERVATION
OR IMPRESSION
STILL WHILE WALKING IN THE GARDEN FEELING THE SUNSHINE AND MARKING
THE BLOOMING AND GROWING PLANTS I PONDERED THE SAME SUBJECT THE WHOLE
HOUSE DISCUSSED
WHAT SUBJECT
MERELY THIS
WHEN MATINS CAME TO BE SAID THERE WAS A PLACE VACANT IN
THE FIRST RANK OF BOARDERS
WHEN BREAKFAST WAS SERVED THERE REMAINED A
COFFEE CUP UNCLAIMED
WHEN THE HOUSEMAID MADE THE BEDS SHE FOUND IN
ONE A BOLSTER LAID LENGTHWISE CLAD IN A CAP AND NIGHT GOWN AND WHEN
GINEVRA FANSHAWE'S MUSIC MISTRESS CAME EARLY AS USUAL TO GIVE THE
MORNING LESSON THAT ACCOMPLISHED AND PROMISING YOUNG PERSON HER
PUPIL FAILED UTTERLY TO BE FORTHCOMING
HIGH AND LOW WAS MISS FANSHAWE SOUGHT THROUGH LENGTH AND BREADTH WAS
THE HOUSE RANSACKED VAINLY NOT A TRACE NOT AN INDICATION NOT SO
MUCH AS A SCRAP OF A BILLET REWARDED THE SEARCH THE NYMPH WAS
VANISHED ENGULFED IN THE PAST NIGHT LIKE A SHOOTING STAR SWALLOWED UP
BY DARKNESS
DEEP WAS THE DISMAY OF SURVEILLANTE TEACHERS DEEPER THE HORROR OF THE
DEFAULTING DIRECTRESS
NEVER HAD I SEEN MADAME BECK SO PALE OR SO
APPALLED
HERE WAS A BLOW STRUCK AT HER TENDER PART HER WEAK SIDE
HERE WAS DAMAGE DONE TO HER INTEREST
HOW TOO HAD THE UNTOWARD EVENT
HAPPENED BY WHAT OUTLET HAD THE FUGITIVE TAKEN WING NOT A CASEMENT
WAS FOUND UNFASTENED NOT A PANE OF GLASS BROKEN ALL THE DOORS WERE
BOLTED SECURE
NEVER TO THIS DAY HAS MADAME BECK OBTAINED SATISFACTION
ON THIS POINT NOR INDEED HAS ANYBODY ELSE CONCERNED SAVE AND
EXCEPTING ONE LUCY SNOWE WHO COULD NOT FORGET HOW TO FACILITATE A
CERTAIN ENTERPRISE A CERTAIN GREAT DOOR HAD BEEN DRAWN SOFTLY TO ITS
LINTEL CLOSED INDEED BUT NEITHER BOLTED NOR SECURE
THE THUNDERING
CARRIAGE AND PAIR ENCOUNTERED WERE NOW LIKEWISE RECALLED AS WELL AS
THAT PUZZLING SIGNAL THE WAVED HANDKERCHIEF
FROM THESE PREMISES AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS INACCESSIBLE TO ANY BUT
MYSELF I COULD DRAW BUT ONE INFERENCE
IT WAS A CASE OF ELOPEMENT
MORALLY CERTAIN ON THIS HEAD AND SEEING MADAME BECK'S PROFOUND
EMBARRASSMENT I AT LAST COMMUNICATED MY CONVICTION
HAVING ALLUDED TO
M
DE HAMAL'S SUIT I FOUND AS I EXPECTED THAT MADAME BECK WAS
PERFECTLY AU FAIT TO THAT AFFAIR
SHE HAD LONG SINCE DISCUSSED IT WITH
MRS
CHOLMONDELEY AND LAID HER OWN RESPONSIBILITY IN THE BUSINESS ON
THAT LADY'S SHOULDERS
TO MRS
CHOLMONDELEY AND M
DE BASSOMPIERRE SHE
NOW HAD RECOURSE
WE FOUND THAT THE HTEL CRCY WAS ALREADY ALIVE TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED
GINEVRA HAD WRITTEN TO HER COUSIN PAULINA VAGUELY SIGNIFYING HYMENEAL
INTENTIONS COMMUNICATIONS HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE FAMILY OF DE
HAMAL M
DE BASSOMPIERRE WAS ON THE TRACK OF THE FUGITIVES
HE
OVERTOOK THEM TOO LATE
IN THE COURSE OF THE WEEK THE POST BROUGHT ME A NOTE
I MAY AS WELL
TRANSCRIBE IT IT CONTAINS EXPLANATION ON MORE THAN ONE POINT
'DEAR OLD TIM SHORT FOR TIMON I AM OFF YOU SEE GONE LIKE A
SHOT
ALFRED AND I INTENDED TO BE MARRIED IN THIS WAY ALMOST FROM THE
FIRST WE NEVER MEANT TO BE SPLICED IN THE HUMDRUM WAY OF OTHER PEOPLE
ALFRED HAS TOO MUCH SPIRIT FOR THAT AND SO HAVE I DIEU MERCI DO YOU
KNOW ALFRED WHO USED TO CALL YOU 'THE DRAGON HAS SEEN SO MUCH OF
YOU DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT HE BEGINS TO FEEL QUITE FRIENDLY
TOWARDS YOU
HE HOPES YOU WON'T MISS HIM NOW THAT HE HAS GONE HE BEGS
TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANY LITTLE TROUBLE HE MAY HAVE GIVEN YOU
HE IS AFRAID
HE RATHER INCONVENIENCED YOU ONCE WHEN HE CAME UPON YOU IN THE GRENIER
JUST AS YOU WERE READING A LETTER SEEMINGLY OF THE MOST SPECIAL
INTEREST BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO GIVE YOU A START
YOU APPEARED SO WONDERFULLY TAKEN UP WITH YOUR CORRESPONDENT
EN
REVANCHE HE SAYS YOU ONCE FRIGHTENED HIM BY RUSHING IN FOR A DRESS OR
A SHAWL OR SOME OTHER CHIFFON AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE HAD STRUCK A
LIGHT AND WAS GOING TO TAKE A QUIET WHIFF OF HIS CIGAR WHILE WAITING
FOR ME
DO YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND BY THIS TIME THAT M
LE COMTE DE HAMAL WAS
THE NUN OF THE ATTIC AND THAT HE CAME TO SEE YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT I
WILL TELL YOU HOW HE MANAGED IT
YOU KNOW HE HAS THE ENTRE OF THE
ATHNE WHERE TWO OR THREE OF HIS NEPHEWS THE SONS OF HIS ELDEST
SISTER MADAME DE MELCY ARE STUDENTS
YOU KNOW THE COURT OF THE
ATHNE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HIGH WALL BOUNDING YOUR WALK THE
ALLE DFENDUE
ALFRED CAN CLIMB AS WELL AS HE CAN DANCE OR FENCE HIS
AMUSEMENT WAS TO MAKE THE ESCALADE OF OUR PENSIONNAT BY MOUNTING FIRST
THE WALL THEN BY THE AID OF THAT HIGH TREE OVERSPREADING THE GRAND
BERCEAU AND RESTING SOME OF ITS BOUGHS ON THE ROOF OF THE LOWER
BUILDINGS OF OUR PREMISES HE MANAGED TO SCALE THE FIRST CLASSE AND THE
GRAND SALLE
ONE NIGHT BY THE WAY HE FELL OUT OF THIS TREE TORE DOWN
SOME OF THE BRANCHES NEARLY BROKE HIS OWN NECK AND AFTER ALL IN
RUNNING AWAY GOT A TERRIBLE FRIGHT AND WAS NEARLY CAUGHT BY TWO
PEOPLE MADAME BECK AND M
EMANUEL HE THINKS WALKING IN THE ALLEY
FROM THE GRANDE SALLE THE ASCENT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO THE HIGHEST BLOCK
OF BUILDING FINISHING IN THE GREAT GARRET
THE SKYLIGHT YOU KNOW IS
DAY AND NIGHT LEFT HALF OPEN FOR AIR BY THE SKYLIGHT HE ENTERED
NEARLY A YEAR AGO I CHANCED TO TELL HIM OUR LEGEND OF THE NUN THAT
SUGGESTED HIS ROMANTIC IDEA OF THE SPECTRAL DISGUISE WHICH I THINK YOU
MUST ALLOW HE HAS VERY CLEVERLY CARRIED OUT
BUT FOR THE NUN'S BLACK GOWN AND WHITE VEIL HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT
AGAIN AND AGAIN BOTH BY YOU AND THAT TIGER JESUIT M
PAUL
HE THINKS
YOU BOTH CAPITAL GHOST SEERS AND VERY BRAVE
WHAT I WONDER AT IS
RATHER YOUR SECRETIVENESS THAN YOUR COURAGE
HOW COULD YOU ENDURE THE
VISITATIONS OF THAT LONG SPECTRE TIME AFTER TIME WITHOUT CRYING OUT
TELLING EVERYBODY AND ROUSING THE WHOLE HOUSE AND NEIGHBOURHOOD
OH AND HOW DID YOU LIKE THE NUN AS A BED FELLOW I DRESSED HER UP
DIDN'T I DO IT WELL DID YOU SHRIEK WHEN YOU SAW HER I SHOULD HAVE
GONE MAD BUT THEN YOU HAVE SUCH NERVES REAL IRON AND BEND LEATHER I
BELIEVE YOU FEEL NOTHING
YOU HAVEN'T THE SAME SENSITIVENESS THAT A
PERSON OF MY CONSTITUTION HAS
YOU SEEM TO ME INSENSIBLE BOTH TO PAIN
AND FEAR AND GRIEF
YOU ARE A REAL OLD DIOGENES
WELL DEAR GRANDMOTHER AND ARE YOU NOT MIGHTILY ANGRY AT MY MOONLIGHT
FLITTING AND RUN AWAY MATCH I ASSURE YOU IT IS EXCELLENT FUN AND I
DID IT PARTLY TO SPITE THAT MINX PAULINA AND THAT BEAR DR
JOHN TO
SHOW THEM THAT WITH ALL THEIR AIRS I COULD GET MARRIED AS WELL AS
THEY
M
DE BASSOMPIERRE WAS AT FIRST IN A STRANGE FUME WITH ALFRED HE
THREATENED A PROSECUTION FOR 'DTOURNEMENT DE MINEUR AND I KNOW NOT
WHAT HE WAS SO ABOMINABLY IN EARNEST THAT I FOUND MYSELF FORCED TO DO
A LITTLE BIT OF THE MELODRAMATIC GO DOWN ON MY KNEES SOB CRY DRENCH
THREE POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS
OF COURSE 'MON ONCLE' SOON GAVE IN
INDEED WHERE WAS THE USE OF MAKING A FUSS I AM MARRIED AND THAT'S
ALL ABOUT IT
HE STILL SAYS OUR MARRIAGE IS NOT LEGAL BECAUSE I AM NOT
OF AGE FORSOOTH AS IF THAT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE I AM JUST AS MUCH
MARRIED AS IF I WERE A HUNDRED
HOWEVER WE ARE TO BE MARRIED AGAIN
AND I AM TO HAVE A TROUSSEAU AND MRS
CHOLMONDELEY IS GOING TO
SUPERINTEND IT AND THERE ARE SOME HOPES THAT M
DE BASSOMPIERRE WILL
GIVE ME A DECENT PORTION WHICH WILL BE VERY CONVENIENT AS DEAR ALFRED
HAS NOTHING BUT HIS NOBILITY NATIVE AND HEREDITARY AND HIS PAY
I
ONLY WISH UNCLE WOULD DO THINGS UNCONDITIONALLY IN A GENEROUS
GENTLEMAN LIKE FASHION HE IS SO DISAGREEABLE AS TO MAKE THE DOWRY
DEPEND ON ALFRED'S GIVING HIS WRITTEN PROMISE THAT HE WILL NEVER TOUCH
CARDS OR DICE FROM THE DAY IT IS PAID DOWN
THEY ACCUSE MY ANGEL OF A
TENDENCY TO PLAY I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT BUT I DO KNOW HE
IS A DEAR ADORABLE CREATURE
I CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY EXTOL THE GENIUS WITH WHICH DE HAMAL MANAGED OUR
FLIGHT
HOW CLEVER IN HIM TO SELECT THE NIGHT OF THE FTE WHEN MADAME
FOR HE KNOWS HER HABITS AS HE SAID WOULD INFALLIBLY BE ABSENT AT
THE CONCERT IN THE PARK
I SUPPOSE YOU MUST HAVE GONE WITH HER
I
WATCHED YOU RISE AND LEAVE THE DORMITORY ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
HOW YOU
RETURNED ALONE AND ON FOOT I CANNOT CONJECTURE
THAT SURELY WAS YOU
WE MET IN THE NARROW OLD RUE ST
JEAN DID YOU SEE ME WAVE MY
HANDKERCHIEF FROM THE CARRIAGE WINDOW
ADIEU REJOICE IN MY GOOD LUCK CONGRATULATE ME ON MY SUPREME
HAPPINESS AND BELIEVE ME DEAR CYNIC AND MISANTHROPE YOURS IN THE
BEST OF HEALTH AND SPIRITS
GINEVRA LAURA DE HAMAL NE FANSHAWE
P S REMEMBER I AM A COUNTESS NOW
PAPA MAMMA AND THE GIRLS AT
HOME WILL BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT
'MY DAUGHTER THE COUNTESS 'MY
SISTER THE COUNTESS BRAVO SOUNDS RATHER BETTER THAN MRS
JOHN
BRETTON HEIN
IN WINDING UP MISTRESS FANSHAWE'S MEMOIRS THE READER WILL NO DOUBT
EXPECT TO HEAR THAT SHE CAME FINALLY TO BITTER EXPIATION OF HER
YOUTHFUL LEVITIES
OF COURSE A LARGE SHARE OF SUFFERING LIES IN
RESERVE FOR HER FUTURE
A FEW WORDS WILL EMBODY MY FARTHER KNOWLEDGE RESPECTING HER
I SAW HER TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF HER HONEYMOON
SHE CALLED ON MADAME
BECK AND SENT FOR ME INTO THE SALON
SHE RUSHED INTO MY ARMS LAUGHING
SHE LOOKED VERY BLOOMING AND BEAUTIFUL HER CURLS WERE LONGER HER
CHEEKS ROSIER THAN EVER HER WHITE BONNET AND HER FLANDERS VEIL HER
ORANGE FLOWERS AND HER BRIDE'S DRESS BECAME HER MIGHTILY
I HAVE GOT MY PORTION SHE CRIED AT ONCE GINEVRA EVER STUCK TO THE
SUBSTANTIAL I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS A GOOD TRADING ELEMENT IN HER
COMPOSITION MUCH AS SHE SCORNED THE BOURGEOISE AND UNCLE DE
BASSOMPIERRE IS QUITE RECONCILED
I DON'T MIND HIS CALLING ALFRED A
'NINCOMPOOP' THAT'S ONLY HIS COARSE SCOTCH BREEDING AND I BELIEVE
PAULINA ENVIES ME AND DR
JOHN IS WILD WITH JEALOUSY FIT TO BLOW HIS
BRAINS OUT AND I'M SO HAPPY I REALLY THINK I'VE HARDLY ANYTHING LEFT
TO WISH FOR UNLESS IT BE A CARRIAGE AND AN HOTEL AND OH I MUST
INTRODUCE YOU TO 'MON MARI ALFRED COME HERE
AND ALFRED APPEARED FROM THE INNER SALON WHERE HE WAS TALKING TO
MADAME BECK RECEIVING THE BLENDED FELICITATIONS AND REPRIMANDS OF THAT
LADY
I WAS PRESENTED UNDER MY VARIOUS NAMES THE DRAGON DIOGENES AND
TIMON
THE YOUNG COLONEL WAS VERY POLITE
HE MADE ME A PRETTILY TURNED
NEATLY WORDED APOLOGY ABOUT THE GHOST VISITS C CONCLUDING WITH
SAYING THAT THE BEST EXCUSE FOR ALL HIS INIQUITIES STOOD THERE
POINTING TO HIS BRIDE
AND THEN THE BRIDE SENT HIM BACK TO MADAME BECK AND SHE TOOK ME TO
HERSELF AND PROCEEDED LITERALLY TO SUFFOCATE ME WITH HER UNRESTRAINED
SPIRITS HER GIRLISH GIDDY WILD NONSENSE
SHE SHOWED HER RING
EXULTINGLY SHE CALLED HERSELF MADAME LA COMTESSE DE HAMAL AND ASKED
HOW IT SOUNDED A SCORE OF TIMES
I SAID VERY LITTLE
I GAVE HER ONLY
THE CRUST AND RIND OF MY NATURE
NO MATTER SHE EXPECTED OF ME NOTHING
BETTER SHE KNEW ME TOO WELL TO LOOK FOR COMPLIMENTS MY DRY GIBES
PLEASED HER WELL ENOUGH AND THE MORE IMPASSIBLE AND PROSAIC MY MIEN
THE MORE MERRILY SHE LAUGHED
SOON AFTER HIS MARRIAGE M
DE HAMAL WAS PERSUADED TO LEAVE THE ARMY AS
THE SUREST WAY OF WEANING HIM FROM CERTAIN UNPROFITABLE ASSOCIATES AND
HABITS A POST OF ATTACH WAS PROCURED FOR HIM AND HE AND HIS YOUNG
WIFE WENT ABROAD
I THOUGHT SHE WOULD FORGET ME NOW BUT SHE DID NOT
FOR MANY YEARS SHE KEPT UP A CAPRICIOUS FITFUL SORT OF
CORRESPONDENCE
DURING THE FIRST YEAR OR TWO IT WAS ONLY OF HERSELF
AND ALFRED SHE WROTE THEN ALFRED FADED IN THE BACKGROUND HERSELF AND
A CERTAIN NEW COMER PREVAILED ONE ALFRED FANSHAWE DE BASSOMPIERRE DE
HAMAL BEGAN TO REIGN IN HIS FATHER'S STEAD
THERE WERE GREAT BOASTINGS
ABOUT THIS PERSONAGE EXTRAVAGANT AMPLIFICATIONS UPON MIRACLES OF
PRECOCITY MIXED WITH VEHEMENT OBJURGATIONS AGAINST THE PHLEGMATIC
INCREDULITY WITH WHICH I RECEIVED THEM
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS TO
BE A MOTHER UNFEELING THING THAT I WAS THE SENSIBILITIES OF THE
MATERNAL HEART WERE GREEK AND HEBREW TO ME AND SO ON
IN DUE COURSE
OF NATURE THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN TOOK HIS DEGREES IN TEETHING MEASLES
HOOPING COUGH THAT WAS A TERRIBLE TIME FOR ME THE MAMMA'S LETTERS
BECAME A PERFECT SHOUT OF AFFLICTION NEVER WOMAN WAS SO PUT UPON BY
CALAMITY NEVER HUMAN BEING STOOD IN SUCH NEED OF SYMPATHY
I WAS
FRIGHTENED AT FIRST AND WROTE BACK PATHETICALLY BUT I SOON FOUND OUT
THERE WAS MORE CRY THAN WOOL IN THE BUSINESS AND RELAPSED INTO MY
NATURAL CRUEL INSENSIBILITY
AS TO THE YOUTHFUL SUFFERER HE WEATHERED
EACH STORM LIKE A HERO
FIVE TIMES WAS THAT YOUTH IN ARTICULO MORTIS
AND FIVE TIMES DID HE MIRACULOUSLY REVIVE
IN THE COURSE OF YEARS THERE AROSE OMINOUS MURMURINGS AGAINST ALFRED
THE FIRST M
DE BASSOMPIERRE HAD TO BE APPEALED TO DEBTS HAD TO BE
PAID SOME OF THEM OF THAT DISMAL AND DINGY ORDER CALLED DEBTS OF
HONOUR IGNOBLE PLAINTS AND DIFFICULTIES BECAME FREQUENT
UNDER EVERY
CLOUD NO MATTER WHAT ITS NATURE GINEVRA AS OF OLD CALLED OUT
LUSTILY FOR SYMPATHY AND AID
SHE HAD NO NOTION OF MEETING ANY DISTRESS
SINGLE HANDED
IN SOME SHAPE FROM SOME QUARTER OR OTHER SHE WAS
PRETTY SURE TO OBTAIN HER WILL AND SO SHE GOT ON FIGHTING THE BATTLE
OF LIFE BY PROXY AND ON THE WHOLE SUFFERING AS LITTLE AS ANY HUMAN
BEING I HAVE EVER KNOWN
CHAPTER XLI
FAUBOURG CLOTILDE
MUST I ERE I CLOSE RENDER SOME ACCOUNT OF THAT FREEDOM AND RENOVATION
WHICH I WON ON THE FTE NIGHT MUST I TELL HOW I AND THE TWO STALWART
COMPANIONS I BROUGHT HOME FROM THE ILLUMINATED PARK BORE THE TEST OF
INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE
I TRIED THEM THE VERY NEXT DAY
THEY HAD BOASTED THEIR STRENGTH LOUDLY
WHEN THEY RECLAIMED ME FROM LOVE AND ITS BONDAGE BUT UPON MY DEMANDING
DEEDS NOT WORDS SOME EVIDENCE OF BETTER COMFORT SOME EXPERIENCE OF A
RELIEVED LIFE FREEDOM EXCUSED HIMSELF AS FOR THE PRESENT IMPOVERISHED
AND DISABLED TO ASSIST AND RENOVATION NEVER SPOKE HE HAD DIED IN THE
NIGHT SUDDENLY
I HAD NOTHING LEFT FOR IT THEN BUT TO TRUST SECRETLY THAT CONJECTURE
MIGHT HAVE HURRIED ME TOO FAST AND TOO FAR TO SUSTAIN THE OPPRESSIVE
HOUR BY REMINDERS OF THE DISTORTING AND DISCOLOURING MAGIC OF JEALOUSY
AFTER A SHORT AND VAIN STRUGGLE I FOUND MYSELF BROUGHT BACK CAPTIVE TO
THE OLD RACK OF SUSPENSE TIED DOWN AND STRAINED ANEW
SHALL I YET SEE HIM BEFORE HE GOES WILL HE BEAR ME IN MIND DOES HE
PURPOSE TO COME WILL THIS DAY WILL THE NEXT HOUR BRING HIM OR MUST I
AGAIN ASSAY THAT CORRODING PAIN OF LONG ATTENT THAT RUDE AGONY OF
RUPTURE AT THE CLOSE THAT MUTE MORTAL WRENCH WHICH IN AT ONCE
UPROOTING HOPE AND DOUBT SHAKES LIFE WHILE THE HAND THAT DOES THE
VIOLENCE CANNOT BE CARESSED TO PITY BECAUSE ABSENCE INTERPOSES HER
BARRIER
IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE ASSUMPTION NO SCHOOL WAS HELD
THE BOARDERS
AND TEACHERS AFTER ATTENDING MASS IN THE MORNING WERE GONE A LONG
WALK INTO THE COUNTRY TO TAKE THEIR GOTER OR AFTERNOON MEAL AT SOME
FARM HOUSE
I DID NOT GO WITH THEM FOR NOW BUT TWO DAYS REMAINED ERE
THE PAUL ET VIRGINIE MUST SAIL AND I WAS CLINGING TO MY LAST CHANCE
AS THE LIVING WAIF OF A WRECK CLINGS TO HIS LAST RAFT OR CABLE
THERE WAS SOME JOINERS' WORK TO DO IN THE FIRST CLASSE SOME BENCH OR
DESK TO REPAIR HOLIDAYS WERE OFTEN TURNED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE
PERFORMANCE OF THESE OPERATIONS WHICH COULD NOT BE EXECUTED WHEN THE
ROOMS WERE FILLED WITH PUPILS
AS I SAT SOLITARY PURPOSING TO ADJOURN
TO THE GARDEN AND LEAVE THE COAST CLEAR BUT TOO LISTLESS TO FULFIL MY
OWN INTENT I HEARD THE WORKMEN COMING
FOREIGN ARTISANS AND SERVANTS DO EVERYTHING BY COUPLES I BELIEVE IT
WOULD TAKE TWO LABASSECOURIEN CARPENTERS TO DRIVE A NAIL
WHILE TYING
ON MY BONNET WHICH HAD HITHERTO HUNG BY ITS RIBBONS FROM MY IDLE HAND
I VAGUELY AND MOMENTARILY WONDERED TO HEAR THE STEP OF BUT ONE
OUVRIER I NOTED TOO AS CAPTIVES IN DUNGEONS FIND SOMETIMES DREARY
LEISURE TO NOTE THE MEREST TRIFLES THAT THIS MAN WORE SHOES AND NOT
SABOTS I CONCLUDED THAT IT MUST BE THE MASTER CARPENTER COMING TO
INSPECT BEFORE HE SENT HIS JOURNEYMEN
I THREW ROUND ME MY SCARF
HE
ADVANCED HE OPENED THE DOOR MY BACK WAS TOWARDS IT I FELT A LITTLE
THRILL A CURIOUS SENSATION TOO QUICK AND TRANSIENT TO BE ANALYZED
I
TURNED I STOOD IN THE SUPPOSED MASTER ARTISAN'S PRESENCE LOOKING
TOWARDS THE DOOR WAY I SAW IT FILLED WITH A FIGURE AND MY EYES
PRINTED UPON MY BRAIN THE PICTURE OF M
PAUL
HUNDREDS OF THE PRAYERS WITH WHICH WE WEARY HEAVEN BRING TO THE
SUPPLIANT NO FULFILMENT
ONCE HAPLY IN LIFE ONE GOLDEN GIFT FALLS
PRONE IN THE LAP ONE BOON FULL AND BRIGHT PERFECT FROM FRUITION'S
MINT
M
EMANUEL WORE THE DRESS IN WHICH HE PROBABLY PURPOSED TO TRAVEL A
SURTOUT GUARDED WITH VELVET I THOUGHT HIM PREPARED FOR INSTANT
DEPARTURE AND YET I HAD UNDERSTOOD THAT TWO DAYS WERE YET TO RUN
BEFORE THE SHIP SAILED
HE LOOKED WELL AND CHEERFUL
HE LOOKED KIND AND
BENIGN HE CAME IN WITH EAGERNESS HE WAS CLOSE TO ME IN ONE SECOND HE
WAS ALL AMITY
IT MIGHT BE HIS BRIDEGROOM MOOD WHICH THUS BRIGHTENED
HIM
WHATEVER THE CAUSE I COULD NOT MEET HIS SUNSHINE WITH CLOUD
IF
THIS WERE MY LAST MOMENT WITH HIM I WOULD NOT WASTE IT IN FORCED
UNNATURAL DISTANCE
I LOVED HIM WELL TOO WELL NOT TO SMITE OUT OF MY
PATH EVEN JEALOUSY HERSELF WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE OBSTRUCTED A KIND
FAREWELL
A CORDIAL WORD FROM HIS LIPS OR A GENTLE LOOK FROM HIS EYES
WOULD DO ME GOOD FOR ALL THE SPAN OF LIFE THAT REMAINED TO ME IT
WOULD BE COMFORT IN THE LAST STRAIT OF LONELINESS I WOULD TAKE IT I
WOULD TASTE THE ELIXIR AND PRIDE SHOULD NOT SPILL THE CUP
THE INTERVIEW WOULD BE SHORT OF COURSE HE WOULD SAY TO ME JUST WHAT
HE HAD SAID TO EACH OF THE ASSEMBLED PUPILS HE WOULD TAKE AND HOLD MY
HAND TWO MINUTES HE WOULD TOUCH MY CHEEK WITH HIS LIPS FOR THE FIRST
LAST ONLY TIME AND THEN NO MORE
THEN INDEED THE FINAL PARTING
THEN THE WIDE SEPARATION THE GREAT GULF I COULD NOT PASS TO GO TO
HIM ACROSS WHICH HAPLY HE WOULD NOT GLANCE TO REMEMBER ME
HE TOOK MY HAND IN ONE OF HIS WITH THE OTHER HE PUT BACK MY BONNET HE
LOOKED INTO MY FACE HIS LUMINOUS SMILE WENT OUT HIS LIPS EXPRESSED
SOMETHING ALMOST LIKE THE WORDLESS LANGUAGE OF A MOTHER WHO FINDS A
CHILD GREATLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY CHANGED BROKEN WITH ILLNESS OR WORN
OUT BY WANT
A CHECK SUPERVENED
PAUL PAUL SAID A WOMAN'S HURRIED VOICE BEHIND PAUL COME INTO THE
SALON I HAVE YET A GREAT MANY THINGS TO SAY TO YOU CONVERSATION FOR
THE WHOLE DAY AND SO HAS VICTOR AND JOSEF IS HERE
COME PAUL COME TO
YOUR FRIENDS
MADAME BECK BROUGHT TO THE SPOT BY VIGILANCE OR AN INSCRUTABLE
INSTINCT PRESSED SO NEAR SHE ALMOST THRUST HERSELF BETWEEN ME AND M
EMANUEL
COME PAUL SHE REITERATED HER EYE GRAZING ME WITH ITS HARD RAY LIKE
A STEEL STYLET
SHE PUSHED AGAINST HER KINSMAN
I THOUGHT HE RECEDED I
THOUGHT HE WOULD GO
PIERCED DEEPER THAN I COULD ENDURE MADE NOW TO
FEEL WHAT DEFIED SUPPRESSION I CRIED
MY HEART WILL BREAK
WHAT I FELT SEEMED LITERAL HEART BREAK BUT THE SEAL OF ANOTHER
FOUNTAIN YIELDED UNDER THE STRAIN ONE BREATH FROM M
PAUL THE
WHISPER TRUST ME LIFTED A LOAD OPENED AN OUTLET
WITH MANY A DEEP
SOB WITH THRILLING WITH ICY SHIVER WITH STRONG TREMBLING AND YET
WITH RELIEF I WEPT
LEAVE HER TO ME IT IS A CRISIS I WILL GIVE HER A CORDIAL AND IT
WILL PASS SAID THE CALM MADAME BECK
TO BE LEFT TO HER AND HER CORDIAL SEEMED TO ME SOMETHING LIKE BEING
LEFT TO THE POISONER AND HER BOWL
WHEN M
PAUL ANSWERED DEEPLY
HARSHLY AND BRIEFLY LAISSEZ MOI IN THE GRIM SOUND I FELT A MUSIC
STRANGE STRONG BUT LIFE GIVING
LAISSEZ MOI HE REPEATED HIS NOSTRILS OPENING AND HIS FACIAL
MUSCLES ALL QUIVERING AS HE SPOKE
BUT THIS WILL NEVER DO SAID MADAME WITH STERNNESS
MORE STERNLY
REJOINED HER KINSMAN
SORTEZ D'ICI
I WILL SEND FOR PRE SILAS ON THE SPOT I WILL SEND FOR HIM SHE
THREATENED PERTINACIOUSLY
FEMME CRIED THE PROFESSOR NOT NOW IN HIS DEEP TONES BUT IN HIS
HIGHEST AND MOST EXCITED KEY FEMME SORTEZ L'INSTANT
HE WAS ROUSED AND I LOVED HIM IN HIS WRATH WITH A PASSION BEYOND WHAT
I HAD YET FELT
WHAT YOU DO IS WRONG PURSUED MADAME IT IS AN ACT CHARACTERISTIC OF
MEN OF YOUR UNRELIABLE IMAGINATIVE TEMPERAMENT A STEP IMPULSIVE
INJUDICIOUS INCONSISTENT A PROCEEDING VEXATIOUS AND NOT ESTIMABLE IN
THE VIEW OF PERSONS OF STEADIER AND MORE RESOLUTE CHARACTER
YOU KNOW NOT WHAT I HAVE OF STEADY AND RESOLUTE IN ME SAID HE BUT
YOU SHALL SEE THE EVENT SHALL TEACH YOU
MODESTE HE CONTINUED LESS
FIERCELY BE GENTLE BE PITYING BE A WOMAN LOOK AT THIS POOR FACE
AND RELENT
YOU KNOW I AM YOUR FRIEND AND THE FRIEND OF YOUR FRIENDS
IN SPITE OF YOUR TAUNTS YOU WELL AND DEEPLY KNOW I MAY BE TRUSTED
OF
SACRIFICING MYSELF I MADE NO DIFFICULTY BUT MY HEART IS PAINED BY WHAT
I SEE IT MUST HAVE AND GIVE SOLACE
LEAVE ME
THIS TIME IN THE LEAVE ME THERE WAS AN INTONATION SO BITTER AND SO
IMPERATIVE I WONDERED THAT EVEN MADAME BECK HERSELF COULD FOR ONE
MOMENT DELAY OBEDIENCE BUT SHE STOOD FIRM SHE GAZED UPON HIM
DAUNTLESS SHE MET HIS EYE FORBIDDING AND FIXED AS STONE
SHE WAS
OPENING HER LIPS TO RETORT I SAW OVER ALL M
PAUL'S FACE A QUICK
RISING LIGHT AND FIRE I CAN HARDLY TELL HOW HE MANAGED THE MOVEMENT
IT DID NOT SEEM VIOLENT IT KEPT THE FORM OF COURTESY HE GAVE HIS
HAND IT SCARCE TOUCHED HER I THOUGHT SHE RAN SHE WHIRLED FROM THE
ROOM SHE WAS GONE AND THE DOOR SHUT IN ONE SECOND
THE FLASH OF PASSION WAS ALL OVER VERY SOON
HE SMILED AS HE TOLD ME TO
WIPE MY EYES HE WAITED QUIETLY TILL I WAS CALM DROPPING FROM TIME TO
TIME A STILLING SOLACING WORD
ERE LONG I SAT BESIDE HIM ONCE MORE
MYSELF RE ASSURED NOT DESPERATE NOR YET DESOLATE NOT FRIENDLESS
NOT HOPELESS NOT SICK OF LIFE AND SEEKING DEATH
IT MADE YOU VERY SAD THEN TO LOSE YOUR FRIEND SAID HE
IT KILLS ME TO BE FORGOTTEN MONSIEUR I SAID
ALL THESE WEARY DAYS
I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM YOU ONE WORD AND I WAS CRUSHED WITH THE
POSSIBILITY GROWING TO CERTAINTY THAT YOU WOULD DEPART WITHOUT SAYING
FAREWELL
MUST I TELL YOU WHAT I TOLD MODESTE BECK THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW ME
MUST I SHOW AND TEACH YOU MY CHARACTER YOU WILL HAVE PROOF THAT I
CAN BE A FIRM FRIEND WITHOUT CLEAR PROOF THIS HAND WILL NOT LIE STILL
IN MINE IT WILL NOT TRUST MY SHOULDER AS A SAFE STAY GOOD
THE PROOF
IS READY
I COME TO JUSTIFY MYSELF
SAY ANYTHING TEACH ANYTHING PROVE ANYTHING MONSIEUR I CAN LISTEN
NOW
THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST GO OUT WITH ME A GOOD DISTANCE INTO
THE TOWN
I CAME ON PURPOSE TO FETCH YOU
WITHOUT QUESTIONING HIS MEANING OR SOUNDING HIS PLAN OR OFFERING THE
SEMBLANCE OF AN OBJECTION I RE TIED MY BONNET I WAS READY
THE ROUTE HE TOOK WAS BY THE BOULEVARDS HE SEVERAL TIMES MADE ME SIT
DOWN ON THE SEATS STATIONED UNDER THE LIME TREES HE DID NOT ASK IF I
WAS TIRED BUT LOOKED AND DREW HIS OWN CONCLUSIONS
ALL THESE WEARY DAYS SAID HE REPEATING MY WORDS WITH A GENTLE
KINDLY MIMICRY OF MY VOICE AND FOREIGN ACCENT NOT NEW FROM HIS LIPS
AND OF WHICH THE PLAYFUL BANTER NEVER WOUNDED NOT EVEN WHEN COUPLED
AS IT OFTEN WAS WITH THE ASSERTION THAT HOWEVER I MIGHT WRITE HIS
LANGUAGE I SPOKE AND ALWAYS SHOULD SPEAK IT IMPERFECTLY AND
HESITATINGLY
'ALL THESE WEARY DAYS' I HAVE NOT FOR ONE HOUR FORGOTTEN
YOU
FAITHFUL WOMEN ERR IN THIS THAT THEY THINK THEMSELVES THE SOLE
FAITHFUL OF GOD'S CREATURES
ON A VERY FERVENT AND LIVING TRUTH TO
MYSELF I TOO TILL LATELY SCARCE DARED COUNT FROM ANY QUARTER
BUT LOOK AT ME
I LIFTED MY HAPPY EYES THEY WERE HAPPY NOW OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN
NO INTERPRETERS OF MY HEART
WELL SAID HE AFTER SOME SECONDS' SCRUTINY THERE IS NO DENYING
THAT SIGNATURE CONSTANCY WROTE IT HER PEN IS OF IRON
WAS THE RECORD
PAINFUL
SEVERELY PAINFUL I SAID WITH TRUTH
WITHDRAW HER HAND MONSIEUR I
CAN BEAR ITS INSCRIBING FORCE NO MORE
ELLE EST TOUTE PLE SAID HE SPEAKING TO HIMSELF CETTE FIGURE L
ME FAIT MAL
AH I AM NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK AT
I COULD NOT HELP SAYING THIS THE WORDS CAME UNBIDDEN I NEVER REMEMBER
THE TIME WHEN I HAD NOT A HAUNTING DREAD OF WHAT MIGHT BE THE DEGREE OF
MY OUTWARD DEFICIENCY THIS DREAD PRESSED ME AT THE MOMENT WITH SPECIAL
FORCE
A GREAT SOFTNESS PASSED UPON HIS COUNTENANCE HIS VIOLET EYES GREW
SUFFUSED AND GLISTENING UNDER THEIR DEEP SPANISH LASHES HE STARTED UP
LET US WALK ON
DO I DISPLEASE YOUR EYES MUCH I TOOK COURAGE TO URGE THE POINT
HAD ITS VITAL IMPORT FOR ME
HE STOPPED AND GAVE ME A SHORT STRONG ANSWER AN ANSWER WHICH
SILENCED SUBDUED YET PROFOUNDLY SATISFIED
EVER AFTER THAT I KNEW
WHAT I WAS FOR HIM AND WHAT I MIGHT BE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD I
CEASED PAINFULLY TO CARE
WAS IT WEAK TO LAY SO MUCH STRESS ON AN
OPINION ABOUT APPEARANCE I FEAR IT MIGHT BE I FEAR IT WAS BUT IN
THAT CASE I MUST AVOW NO LIGHT SHARE OF WEAKNESS
I MUST OWN GREAT FEAR
OF DISPLEASING A STRONG WISH MODERATELY TO PLEASE M
PAUL
WHITHER WE RAMBLED I SCARCE KNEW
OUR WALK WAS LONG YET SEEMED SHORT
THE PATH WAS PLEASANT THE DAY LOVELY
M
EMANUEL TALKED OF HIS
VOYAGE HE THOUGHT OF STAYING AWAY THREE YEARS
ON HIS RETURN FROM
GUADALOUPE HE LOOKED FORWARD TO RELEASE FROM LIABILITIES AND A CLEAR
COURSE AND WHAT DID I PURPOSE DOING IN THE INTERVAL OF HIS ABSENCE HE
ASKED
I HAD TALKED ONCE HE REMINDED ME OF TRYING TO BE INDEPENDENT
AND KEEPING A LITTLE SCHOOL OF MY OWN HAD I DROPPED THE IDEA
INDEED I HAD NOT I WAS DOING MY BEST TO SAVE WHAT WOULD ENABLE ME TO
PUT IT IN PRACTICE
HE DID NOT LIKE LEAVING ME IN THE RUE FOSSETTE HE FEARED I SHOULD
MISS HIM THERE TOO MUCH I SHOULD FEEL DESOLATE I SHOULD GROW SAD
THIS WAS CERTAIN BUT I PROMISED TO DO MY BEST TO ENDURE
STILL SAID HE SPEAKING LOW THERE IS ANOTHER OBJECTION TO YOUR
PRESENT RESIDENCE
I SHOULD WISH TO WRITE TO YOU SOMETIMES IT WOULD
NOT BE WELL TO HAVE ANY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE SAFE TRANSMISSION OF
LETTERS AND IN THE RUE FOSSETTE IN SHORT OUR CATHOLIC DISCIPLINE IN
CERTAIN MATTERS THOUGH JUSTIFIABLE AND EXPEDIENT MIGHT POSSIBLY
UNDER PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES BECOME LIABLE TO MISAPPLICATION PERHAPS
ABUSE
BUT IF YOU WRITE SAID I I MUST HAVE YOUR LETTERS AND I WILL
HAVE THEM TEN DIRECTORS TWENTY DIRECTRESSES SHALL NOT KEEP THEM FROM
ME
I AM A PROTESTANT I WILL NOT BEAR THAT KIND OF DISCIPLINE
MONSIEUR I WILL NOT
DOUCEMENT DOUCEMENT REJOINED HE WE WILL CONTRIVE A PLAN WE HAVE
OUR RESOURCES SOYEZ TRANQUILLE
SO SPEAKING HE PAUSED
WE WERE NOW RETURNING FROM THE LONG WALK
WE HAD REACHED THE MIDDLE OF
A CLEAN FAUBOURG WHERE THE HOUSES WERE SMALL BUT LOOKED PLEASANT
IT
WAS BEFORE THE WHITE DOOR STEP OF A VERY NEAT ABODE THAT M

TASTEFULLY PAINTED ITS VISTA CLOSED IN A FRENCH WINDOW WITH VINES
TRAINED ABOUT THE PANES TENDRILS AND GREEN LEAVES KISSING THE GLASS
SILENCE REIGNED IN THIS DWELLING
OPENING AN INNER DOOR M

REPLIED

DOOR

EXTERNAT DE DEMOISELLES
NUMRO 7 FAUBOURG CLOTILDE DIRECTRICE
MADEMOISELLE LUCY SNOWE
AND WHAT DID I SAY TO M
PAUL EMANUEL
CERTAIN JUNCTURES OF OUR LIVES MUST ALWAYS BE DIFFICULT OF RECALL TO
MEMORY
CERTAIN POINTS CRISES CERTAIN FEELINGS JOYS GRIEFS AND
AMAZEMENTS WHEN REVIEWED MUST STRIKE US AS THINGS WILDERED AND
WHIRLING DIM AS A WHEEL FAST SPUN
I CAN NO MORE REMEMBER THE THOUGHTS OR THE WORDS OF THE TEN MINUTES
SUCCEEDING THIS DISCLOSURE THAN I CAN RETRACE THE EXPERIENCE OF MY
EARLIEST YEAR OF LIFE AND YET THE FIRST THING DISTINCT TO ME IS THE
CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I WAS SPEAKING VERY FAST REPEATING OVER AND OVER
AGAIN

MORTAL WEEKS FROM HOUSE PAINTER TO UPHOLSTERER FROM CABINET MAKER TO
CHARWOMAN
LUCY AND LUCY'S COT THE SOLE THOUGHTS IN HIS HEAD
I HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO DO
I FIRST CARESSED THE SOFT VELVET ON HIS CUFF
AND THEN
I STROKED THE HAND IT SURROUNDED
IT WAS HIS FORESIGHT HIS
GOODNESS HIS SILENT STRONG EFFECTIVE GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERED ME
BY THEIR PROVED REALITY
IT WAS THE ASSURANCE OF HIS SLEEPLESS INTEREST
WHICH BROKE ON ME LIKE A LIGHT FROM HEAVEN IT WAS HIS I WILL DARE TO
SAY IT HIS FOND TENDER LOOK WHICH NOW SHOOK ME INDESCRIBABLY
IN THE
MIDST OF ALL I FORCED MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE PRACTICAL
THE TROUBLE I CRIED AND THE COST HAD YOU MONEY M
PAUL
PLENTY OF MONEY SAID HE HEARTILY
THE DISPOSAL OF MY LARGE TEACHING
CONNECTION PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF A HANDSOME SUM WITH PART OF IT I
DETERMINED TO GIVE MYSELF THE RICHEST TREAT THAT I HAVE KNOWN OR
SHALL KNOW
I LIKE THIS
I HAVE RECKONED ON THIS HOUR DAY AND NIGHT
LATELY
I WOULD NOT COME NEAR YOU BECAUSE I WOULD NOT FORESTALL IT
RESERVE IS NEITHER MY VIRTUE NOR MY VICE
IF I HAD PUT MYSELF INTO YOUR
POWER AND YOU HAD BEGUN WITH YOUR QUESTIONS OF LOOK AND LIP WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN M
PAUL WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WHAT IS YOUR
MYSTERY MY SOLITARY FIRST AND LAST SECRET WOULD PRESENTLY HAVE
UNRAVELLED ITSELF IN YOUR LAP
NOW HE PURSUED YOU SHALL LIVE HERE

ACCOUNT WILL BE READY
MONSIEUR MONSIEUR YOU ARE TOO GOOD
IN SUCH INADEQUATE LANGUAGE MY FEELINGS STRUGGLED FOR EXPRESSION THEY
COULD NOT GET IT SPEECH BRITTLE AND UNMALLEABLE AND COLD AS ICE
DISSOLVED OR SHIVERED IN THE EFFORT
HE WATCHED ME STILL HE GENTLY
RAISED HIS HAND TO STROKE MY HAIR IT TOUCHED MY LIPS IN PASSING I
PRESSED IT CLOSE I PAID IT TRIBUTE
HE WAS MY KING ROYAL FOR ME HAD
BEEN THAT HAND'S BOUNTY TO OFFER HOMAGE WAS BOTH A JOY AND A DUTY
THE AFTERNOON HOURS WERE OVER AND THE STILLER TIME OF EVENING SHADED
THE QUIET FAUBOURG
M
PAUL CLAIMED MY HOSPITALITY OCCUPIED AND AFOOT
SINCE MORNING HE NEEDED REFRESHMENT HE SAID I SHOULD OFFER HIM
CHOCOLATE IN MY PRETTY GOLD AND WHITE CHINA SERVICE
HE WENT OUT AND
ORDERED WHAT WAS NEEDFUL FROM THE RESTAURANT HE PLACED THE SMALL
GURIDON AND TWO CHAIRS IN THE BALCONY OUTSIDE THE FRENCH WINDOW UNDER
THE SCREENING VINES
WITH WHAT SHY JOY I ACCEPTED MY PART AS HOSTESS
ARRANGED THE SALVER SERVED THE BENEFACTOR GUEST
THIS BALCONY WAS IN THE REAR OF THE HOUSE THE GARDENS OF THE FAUBOURG
WERE ROUND US FIELDS EXTENDED BEYOND
THE AIR WAS STILL MILD AND
FRESH
ABOVE THE POPLARS THE LAURELS THE CYPRESSES AND THE ROSES
LOOKED UP A MOON SO LOVELY AND SO HALCYON THE HEART TREMBLED UNDER HER
SMILE A STAR SHONE SUBJECT BESIDE HER WITH THE UNEMULOUS RAY OF PURE
LOVE
IN A LARGE GARDEN NEAR US A JET ROSE FROM A WELL AND A PALE
STATUE LEANED OVER THE PLAY OF WATERS
M
PAUL TALKED TO ME
HIS VOICE WAS SO MODULATED THAT IT MIXED
HARMONIOUS WITH THE SILVER WHISPER THE GUSH THE MUSICAL SIGH IN
WHICH LIGHT BREEZE FOUNTAIN AND FOLIAGE INTONED THEIR LULLING VESPER
HAPPY HOUR STAY ONE MOMENT DROOP THOSE PLUMES REST THOSE WINGS
INCLINE TO MINE THAT BROW OF HEAVEN WHITE ANGEL LET THY LIGHT LINGER
LEAVE ITS REFLECTION ON SUCCEEDING CLOUDS BEQUEATH ITS CHEER TO THAT
TIME WHICH NEEDS A RAY IN RETROSPECT
OUR MEAL WAS SIMPLE THE CHOCOLATE THE ROLLS THE PLATE OF FRESH
SUMMER FRUIT CHERRIES AND STRAWBERRIES BEDDED IN GREEN LEAVES FORMED
THE WHOLE BUT IT WAS WHAT WE BOTH LIKED BETTER THAN A FEAST AND I
TOOK A DELIGHT INEXPRESSIBLE IN TENDING M
PAUL
I ASKED HIM WHETHER
HIS FRIENDS PRE SILAS AND MADAME BECK KNEW WHAT HE HAD DONE WHETHER
THEY HAD SEEN MY HOUSE
MON AMIE SAID HE NONE KNOWS WHAT I HAVE DONE SAVE YOU AND MYSELF
THE PLEASURE IS CONSECRATED TO US TWO UNSHARED AND UNPROFANED
TO
SPEAK TRUTH THERE HAS BEEN TO ME IN THIS MATTER A REFINEMENT OF
ENJOYMENT I WOULD NOT MAKE VULGAR BY COMMUNICATION
BESIDES SMILING
I WANTED TO PROVE TO MISS LUCY THAT I COULD KEEP A SECRET
HOW OFTEN
HAS SHE TAUNTED ME WITH LACK OF DIGNIFIED RESERVE AND NEEDFUL CAUTION
HOW MANY TIMES HAS SHE SAUCILY INSINUATED THAT ALL MY AFFAIRS ARE THE
SECRET OF POLICHINELLE
THIS WAS TRUE ENOUGH I HAD NOT SPARED HIM ON THIS POINT NOR PERHAPS
ON ANY OTHER THAT WAS ASSAILABLE
MAGNIFICENT MINDED GRAND HEARTED
DEAR FAULTY LITTLE MAN YOU DESERVED CANDOUR AND FROM ME ALWAYS HAD
IT
CONTINUING MY QUERIES I ASKED TO WHOM THE HOUSE BELONGED WHO WAS MY
LANDLORD THE AMOUNT OF MY RENT
HE INSTANTLY GAVE ME THESE PARTICULARS
IN WRITING HE HAD FORESEEN AND PREPARED ALL THINGS
THE HOUSE WAS NOT M
PAUL'S THAT I GUESSED HE WAS HARDLY THE MAN TO
BECOME A PROPRIETOR I MORE THAN SUSPECTED IN HIM A LAMENTABLE ABSENCE
OF THE SAVING FACULTY HE COULD GET BUT NOT KEEP HE NEEDED A
TREASURER
THE TENEMENT THEN BELONGED TO A CITIZEN IN THE
BASSE VILLE A MAN OF SUBSTANCE M
PAUL SAID HE STARTLED ME BY
ADDING A FRIEND OF YOURS MISS LUCY A PERSON WHO HAS A MOST
RESPECTFUL REGARD FOR YOU AND TO MY PLEASANT SURPRISE I FOUND THE
LANDLORD WAS NONE OTHER THAN M
MIRET THE SHORT TEMPERED AND
KIND HEARTED BOOKSELLER WHO HAD SO KINDLY FOUND ME A SEAT THAT
EVENTFUL NIGHT IN THE PARK
IT SEEMS M
MIRET WAS IN HIS STATION
RICH AS WELL AS MUCH RESPECTED AND POSSESSED SEVERAL HOUSES IN THIS
FAUBOURG THE RENT WAS MODERATE SCARCE HALF OF WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
FOR A HOUSE OF EQUAL SIZE NEARER THE CENTRE OF VILLETTE
AND THEN OBSERVED M
PAUL SHOULD FORTUNE NOT FAVOUR YOU THOUGH I
THINK SHE WILL I HAVE THE SATISFACTION TO THINK YOU ARE IN GOOD HANDS
M
MIRET WILL NOT BE EXTORTIONATE THE FIRST YEAR'S RENT YOU HAVE
ALREADY IN YOUR SAVINGS AFTERWARDS MISS LUCY MUST TRUST GOD AND
HERSELF
BUT NOW WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR PUPILS
I MUST DISTRIBUTE MY PROSPECTUSES
RIGHT BY WAY OF LOSING NO TIME I GAVE ONE TO M
MIRET YESTERDAY
SHOULD YOU OBJECT TO BEGINNING WITH THREE PETITE BOURGEOISES THE
DEMOISELLES MIRET THEY ARE AT YOUR SERVICE
MONSIEUR YOU FORGET NOTHING YOU ARE WONDERFUL
OBJECT IT WOULD
BECOME ME INDEED TO OBJECT I SUPPOSE I HARDLY EXPECT AT THE OUTSET TO
NUMBER ARISTOCRATS IN MY LITTLE DAY SCHOOL I CARE NOT IF THEY NEVER
COME
I SHALL BE PROUD TO RECEIVE M
MIRET'S DAUGHTERS
BESIDES THESE PURSUED HE ANOTHER PUPIL OFFERS WHO WILL COME DAILY
TO TAKE LESSONS IN ENGLISH AND AS SHE IS RICH SHE WILL PAY
HANDSOMELY
I MEAN MY GOD DAUGHTER AND WARD JUSTINE MARIE SAUVEUR
WHAT IS IN A NAME WHAT IN THREE WORDS TILL THIS MOMENT I HAD
LISTENED WITH LIVING JOY I HAD ANSWERED WITH GLEEFUL QUICKNESS A NAME
FROZE ME THREE WORDS STRUCK ME MUTE
THE EFFECT COULD NOT BE HIDDEN
AND INDEED I SCARCE TRIED TO HIDE IT
WHAT NOW SAID M
PAUL
NOTHING
NOTHING YOUR COUNTENANCE CHANGES YOUR COLOUR AND YOUR VERY EYES
FADE
NOTHING YOU MUST BE ILL YOU HAVE SOME SUFFERING TELL ME WHAT
I HAD NOTHING TO TELL
HE DREW HIS CHAIR NEARER
HE DID NOT GROW VEXED THOUGH I CONTINUED
SILENT AND ICY
HE TRIED TO WIN A WORD HE ENTREATED WITH PERSEVERANCE
HE WAITED WITH PATIENCE
JUSTINE MARIE IS A GOOD GIRL SAID HE DOCILE AND AMIABLE NOT
QUICK BUT YOU WILL LIKE HER
I THINK NOT
I THINK SHE MUST NOT COME HERE
SUCH WAS MY SPEECH
DO YOU WISH TO PUZZLE ME DO YOU KNOW HER BUT IN TRUTH THERE IS
SOMETHING
AGAIN YOU ARE PALE AS THAT STATUE
RELY ON PAUL CARLOS TELL
HIM THE GRIEF
HIS CHAIR TOUCHED MINE HIS HAND QUIETLY ADVANCED TURNED ME TOWARDS
HIM
DO YOU KNOW MARIE JUSTINE SAID HE AGAIN
THE NAME RE PRONOUNCED BY HIS LIPS OVERCAME ME UNACCOUNTABLY
IT DID
NOT PROSTRATE NO IT STIRRED ME UP RUNNING WITH HASTE AND HEAT
THROUGH MY VEINS RECALLING AN HOUR OF QUICK PAIN MANY DAYS AND NIGHTS
OF HEART SICKNESS
NEAR ME AS HE NOW SAT STRONGLY AND CLOSELY AS HE
HAD LONG TWINED HIS LIFE IN MINE FAR AS HAD PROGRESSED AND NEAR AS
WAS ACHIEVED OUR MINDS' AND AFFECTIONS' ASSIMILATION THE VERY
SUGGESTION OF INTERFERENCE OF HEART SEPARATION COULD BE HEARD ONLY
WITH A FERMENTING EXCITEMENT AN IMPETUOUS THROE A DISDAINFUL RESOLVE
AN IRE A RESISTANCE OF WHICH NO HUMAN EYE OR CHEEK COULD HIDE THE
FLAME NOR ANY TRUTH ACCUSTOMED HUMAN TONGUE CURB THE CRY
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING I SAID I WANT TO TELL YOU ALL
SPEAK LUCY COME NEAR SPEAK
WHO PRIZES YOU IF I DO NOT WHO IS
YOUR FRIEND IF NOT EMANUEL SPEAK
I SPOKE
ALL ESCAPED FROM MY LIPS
I LACKED NOT WORDS NOW FAST I
NARRATED FLUENT I TOLD MY TALE IT STREAMED ON MY TONGUE
I WENT BACK
TO THE NIGHT IN THE PARK I MENTIONED THE MEDICATED DRAUGHT WHY IT WAS
GIVEN ITS GOADING EFFECT HOW IT HAD TORN REST FROM UNDER MY HEAD
SHAKEN ME FROM MY COUCH CARRIED ME ABROAD WITH THE LURE OF A VIVID YET
SOLEMN FANCY A SUMMER NIGHT SOLITUDE ON TURF UNDER TREES NEAR A
DEEP COOL LAKELET
I TOLD THE SCENE REALIZED THE CROWD THE MASQUES
THE MUSIC THE LAMPS THE SPLENDOURS THE GUNS BOOMING AFAR THE BELLS
SOUNDING ON HIGH
ALL I HAD ENCOUNTERED I DETAILED ALL I HAD
RECOGNISED HEARD AND SEEN HOW I HAD BEHELD AND WATCHED HIMSELF HOW
I LISTENED HOW MUCH HEARD WHAT CONJECTURED THE WHOLE HISTORY IN
BRIEF SUMMONED TO HIS CONFIDENCE RUSHED THITHER TRUTHFUL LITERAL
ARDENT BITTER
STILL AS I NARRATED INSTEAD OF CHECKING HE INCITED ME TO PROCEED HE
SPURRED ME BY THE GESTURE THE SMILE THE HALF WORD
BEFORE I HAD HALF
DONE HE HELD BOTH MY HANDS HE CONSULTED MY EYES WITH A MOST PIERCING
GLANCE THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS FACE WHICH TENDED NEITHER TO CALM
NOR TO PUT ME DOWN HE FORGOT HIS OWN DOCTRINE HE FORSOOK HIS OWN
SYSTEM OF REPRESSION WHEN I MOST CHALLENGED ITS EXERCISE
I THINK I
DESERVED STRONG REPROOF BUT WHEN HAVE WE OUR DESERTS I MERITED
SEVERITY HE LOOKED INDULGENCE
TO MY VERY SELF I SEEMED IMPERIOUS AND
UNREASONABLE FOR I FORBADE JUSTINE MARIE MY DOOR AND ROOF HE SMILED
BETRAYING DELIGHT
WARM JEALOUS AND HAUGHTY I KNEW NOT TILL NOW THAT
MY NATURE HAD SUCH A MOOD HE GATHERED ME NEAR HIS HEART
I WAS FULL OF
FAULTS HE TOOK THEM AND ME ALL HOME
FOR THE MOMENT OF UTMOST MUTINY
HE RESERVED THE ONE DEEP SPELL OF PEACE
THESE WORDS CARESSED MY EAR
LUCY TAKE MY LOVE
ONE DAY SHARE MY LIFE
BE MY DEAREST FIRST ON
EARTH
WE WALKED BACK TO THE RUE FOSSETTE BY MOONLIGHT SUCH MOONLIGHT AS FELL
ON EDEN SHINING THROUGH THE SHADES OF THE GREAT GARDEN AND HAPLY
GILDING A PATH GLORIOUS FOR A STEP DIVINE A PRESENCE NAMELESS
ONCE IN
THEIR LIVES SOME MEN AND WOMEN GO BACK TO THESE FIRST FRESH DAYS OF OUR
GREAT SIRE AND MOTHER TASTE THAT GRAND MORNING'S DEW BATHE IN ITS
SUNRISE
IN THE COURSE OF THE WALK I WAS TOLD HOW JUSTINE MARIE SAUVEUR HAD
ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED WITH THE AFFECTION PROPER TO A DAUGHTER HOW WITH
M
PAUL'S CONSENT SHE HAD BEEN AFFIANCED FOR MONTHS TO ONE HEINRICH
MHLER A WEALTHY YOUNG GERMAN MERCHANT AND WAS TO BE MARRIED IN THE
COURSE OF A YEAR
SOME OF M
EMANUEL'S RELATIONS AND CONNECTIONS WOULD
INDEED IT SEEMS HAVE LIKED HIM TO MARRY HER WITH A VIEW TO SECURING
HER FORTUNE IN THE FAMILY BUT TO HIMSELF THE SCHEME WAS REPUGNANT AND
THE IDEA TOTALLY INADMISSIBLE
WE REACHED MADAME BECK'S DOOR
JEAN BAPTISTE'S CLOCK TOLLED NINE
AT
THIS HOUR IN THIS HOUSE EIGHTEEN MONTHS SINCE HAD THIS MAN AT MY
SIDE BENT BEFORE ME LOOKED INTO MY FACE AND EYES AND ARBITERED MY
DESTINY
THIS VERY EVENING HE HAD AGAIN STOOPED GAZED AND DECREED
HOW DIFFERENT THE LOOK HOW FAR OTHERWISE THE FATE
HE DEEMED ME BORN UNDER HIS STAR HE SEEMED TO HAVE SPREAD OVER ME ITS
BEAM LIKE A BANNER
ONCE UNKNOWN AND UNLOVED I HELD HIM HARSH AND
STRANGE THE LOW STATURE THE WIRY MAKE THE ANGLES THE DARKNESS THE
MANNER DISPLEASED ME
NOW PENETRATED WITH HIS INFLUENCE AND LIVING
BY HIS AFFECTION HAVING HIS WORTH BY INTELLECT AND HIS GOODNESS BY
HEART I PREFERRED HIM BEFORE ALL HUMANITY
WE PARTED HE GAVE ME HIS PLEDGE AND THEN HIS FAREWELL
WE PARTED THE
NEXT DAY HE SAILED
CHAPTER XLII
FINIS
MAN CANNOT PROPHESY
LOVE IS NO ORACLE
FEAR SOMETIMES IMAGINES A VAIN
THING
THOSE YEARS OF ABSENCE HOW HAD I SICKENED OVER THEIR
ANTICIPATION THE WOE THEY MUST BRING SEEMED CERTAIN AS DEATH
I KNEW
THE NATURE OF THEIR COURSE I NEVER HAD DOUBT HOW IT WOULD HARROW AS IT
WENT
THE JUGGERNAUT ON HIS CAR TOWERED THERE A GRIM LOAD
SEEING HIM
DRAW NIGH BURYING HIS BROAD WHEELS IN THE OPPRESSED SOIL I THE
PROSTRATE VOTARY FELT BEFOREHAND THE ANNIHILATING CRAUNCH
STRANGE TO SAY STRANGE YET TRUE AND OWNING MANY PARALLELS IN LIFE'S
EXPERIENCE THAT ANTICIPATORY CRAUNCH PROVED ALL YES NEARLY ALL THE
TORTURE
THE GREAT JUGGERNAUT IN HIS GREAT CHARIOT DREW ON LOFTY
LOUD AND SULLEN
HE PASSED QUIETLY LIKE A SHADOW SWEEPING THE SKY AT
NOON
NOTHING BUT A CHILLING DIMNESS WAS SEEN OR FELT
I LOOKED UP
CHARIOT AND DEMON CHARIOTEER WERE GONE BY THE VOTARY STILL LIVED
M
EMANUEL WAS AWAY THREE YEARS
READER THEY WERE THE THREE HAPPIEST
YEARS OF MY LIFE
DO YOU SCOUT THE PARADOX LISTEN
I COMMENCED MY
SCHOOL I WORKED I WORKED HARD
I DEEMED MYSELF THE STEWARD OF HIS
PROPERTY AND DETERMINED GOD WILLING TO RENDER A GOOD ACCOUNT
PUPILS
CAME BURGHERS AT FIRST A HIGHER CLASS ERE LONG
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF
THE SECOND YEAR AN UNEXPECTED CHANCE THREW INTO MY HANDS AN ADDITIONAL
HUNDRED POUNDS ONE DAY I RECEIVED FROM ENGLAND A LETTER CONTAINING
THAT SUM
IT CAME FROM MR
MARCHMONT THE COUSIN AND HEIR OF MY DEAR
AND DEAD MISTRESS
HE WAS JUST RECOVERING FROM A DANGEROUS ILLNESS THE
MONEY WAS A PEACE OFFERING TO HIS CONSCIENCE REPROACHING HIM IN THE
MATTER OF I KNOW NOT WHAT PAPERS OR MEMORANDA FOUND AFTER HIS
KINSWOMAN'S DEATH NAMING OR RECOMMENDING LUCY SNOWE
MRS
BARRETT HAD
GIVEN HIM MY ADDRESS
HOW FAR HIS CONSCIENCE HAD BEEN SINNED AGAINST I
NEVER INQUIRED
I ASKED NO QUESTIONS BUT TOOK THE CASH AND MADE IT
USEFUL
WITH THIS HUNDRED POUNDS I VENTURED TO TAKE THE HOUSE ADJOINING MINE
I
WOULD NOT LEAVE THAT WHICH M
PAUL HAD CHOSEN IN WHICH HE HAD LEFT
AND WHERE HE EXPECTED AGAIN TO FIND ME
MY EXTERNAT BECAME A
PENSIONNAT THAT ALSO PROSPERED
THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS DID NOT LIE SO MUCH IN MYSELF IN ANY
ENDOWMENT ANY POWER OF MINE AS IN A NEW STATE OF CIRCUMSTANCES A
WONDERFULLY CHANGED LIFE A RELIEVED HEART
THE SPRING WHICH MOVED MY
ENERGIES LAY FAR AWAY BEYOND SEAS IN AN INDIAN ISLE
AT PARTING I HAD
BEEN LEFT A LEGACY SUCH A THOUGHT FOR THE PRESENT SUCH A HOPE FOR THE
FUTURE SUCH A MOTIVE FOR A PERSEVERING A LABORIOUS AN ENTERPRISING
A PATIENT AND A BRAVE COURSE I COULD NOT FLAG
FEW THINGS SHOOK ME
NOW FEW THINGS HAD IMPORTANCE TO VEX INTIMIDATE OR DEPRESS ME MOST
THINGS PLEASED MERE TRIFLES HAD A CHARM
DO NOT THINK THAT THIS GENIAL FLAME SUSTAINED ITSELF OR LIVED WHOLLY
ON A BEQUEATHED HOPE OR A PARTING PROMISE
A GENEROUS PROVIDER SUPPLIED
BOUNTEOUS FUEL
I WAS SPARED ALL CHILL ALL STINT I WAS NOT SUFFERED
TO FEAR PENURY I WAS NOT TRIED WITH SUSPENSE
BY EVERY VESSEL HE
WROTE HE WROTE AS HE GAVE AND AS HE LOVED IN FULL HANDED
FULL HEARTED PLENITUDE
HE WROTE BECAUSE HE LIKED TO WRITE HE DID NOT
ABRIDGE BECAUSE HE CARED NOT TO ABRIDGE
HE SAT DOWN HE TOOK PEN AND
PAPER BECAUSE HE LOVED LUCY AND HAD MUCH TO SAY TO HER BECAUSE HE WAS
FAITHFUL AND THOUGHTFUL BECAUSE HE WAS TENDER AND TRUE
THERE WAS NO
SHAM AND NO CHEAT AND NO HOLLOW UNREAL IN HIM
APOLOGY NEVER DROPPED
HER SLIPPERY OIL ON HIS LIPS NEVER PROFFERED BY HIS PEN HER COWARD
FEINTS AND PALTRY NULLITIES HE WOULD GIVE NEITHER A STONE NOR AN
EXCUSE NEITHER A SCORPION NOR A DISAPPOINTMENT HIS LETTERS WERE REAL
FOOD THAT NOURISHED LIVING WATER THAT REFRESHED
AND WAS I GRATEFUL GOD KNOWS I BELIEVE THAT SCARCE A LIVING BEING SO
REMEMBERED SO SUSTAINED DEALT WITH IN KIND SO CONSTANT HONOURABLE
AND NOBLE COULD BE OTHERWISE THAN GRATEFUL TO THE DEATH
ADHERENT TO HIS OWN RELIGION IN HIM WAS NOT THE STUFF OF WHICH IS MADE
THE FACILE APOSTATE HE FREELY LEFT ME MY PURE FAITH
HE DID NOT TEASE
NOR TEMPT
HE SAID
REMAIN A PROTESTANT
MY LITTLE ENGLISH PURITAN I LOVE PROTESTANTISM
IN YOU
I OWN ITS SEVERE CHARM
THERE IS SOMETHING IN ITS RITUAL I
CANNOT RECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT IS THE SOLE CREED FOR 'LUCY
ALL ROME COULD NOT PUT INTO HIM BIGOTRY NOR THE PROPAGANDA ITSELF MAKE
HIM A REAL JESUIT
HE WAS BORN HONEST AND NOT FALSE ARTLESS AND NOT
CUNNING A FREEMAN AND NOT A SLAVE
HIS TENDERNESS HAD RENDERED HIM
DUCTILE IN A PRIEST'S HANDS HIS AFFECTION HIS DEVOTEDNESS HIS
SINCERE PIOUS ENTHUSIASM BLINDED HIS KIND EYES SOMETIMES MADE HIM
ABANDON JUSTICE TO HIMSELF TO DO THE WORK OF CRAFT AND SERVE THE ENDS
OF SELFISHNESS BUT THESE ARE FAULTS SO RARE TO FIND SO COSTLY TO
THEIR OWNER TO INDULGE WE SCARCE KNOW WHETHER THEY WILL NOT ONE DAY BE
RECKONED AMONGST THE JEWELS
AND NOW THE THREE YEARS ARE PAST M
EMANUEL'S RETURN IS FIXED
IT IS
AUTUMN HE IS TO BE WITH ME ERE THE MISTS OF NOVEMBER COME
MY SCHOOL
FLOURISHES MY HOUSE IS READY I HAVE MADE HIM A LITTLE LIBRARY FILLED
ITS SHELVES WITH THE BOOKS HE LEFT IN MY CARE I HAVE CULTIVATED OUT OF
LOVE FOR HIM I WAS NATURALLY NO FLORIST THE PLANTS HE PREFERRED AND
SOME OF THEM ARE YET IN BLOOM
I THOUGHT I LOVED HIM WHEN HE WENT AWAY
I LOVE HIM NOW IN ANOTHER DEGREE HE IS MORE MY OWN
THE SUN PASSES THE EQUINOX THE DAYS SHORTEN THE LEAVES GROW SERE
BUT HE IS COMING
FROSTS APPEAR AT NIGHT NOVEMBER HAS SENT HIS FOGS IN ADVANCE THE WIND
TAKES ITS AUTUMN MOAN BUT HE IS COMING
THE SKIES HANG FULL AND DARK A WRACK SAILS FROM THE WEST THE CLOUDS
CAST THEMSELVES INTO STRANGE FORMS ARCHES AND BROAD RADIATIONS THERE
